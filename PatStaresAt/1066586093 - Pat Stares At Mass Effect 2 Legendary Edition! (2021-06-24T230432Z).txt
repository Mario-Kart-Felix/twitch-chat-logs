[0:14:41] <%Maids4lyfe> wrong
[0:14:42] <godzookylives> DansGame
[0:14:44] <Alzero83> You liar
[0:14:46] <%washicka> Pepperoni is worse sausage
[0:14:46] <%dekkitout> How ya feel about banana peppers?
[0:14:46] <%ssjklyco> Anchovies are horrid
[0:14:48] <Sotetsu> I started playing Genshin again, and it reminded me when Pat did all that whaling.
[0:14:48] <PanicSwytch> This is not new lore
[0:14:49] <%ExpressNode> Its alright I don't really eat it except on pizza
[0:14:50] <%bassoontyphoon> But why
[0:14:50] <%Shubreaker> SPEAK YOUR TRUTH
[0:14:50] <brisk_dacat> what if its diced
[0:14:51] <%ComfortableStranger> anchovies
[0:14:52] <stantheman_97> wrong but whatever
[0:14:52] <+Daigrey> Poutine
[0:14:52] <Zeif00> Are we talking quarter sized or dime sized?
[0:14:53] <%JoshManVGH> Why are you eating the most of it?
[0:14:53] <$RealThiele> what ?!? nipples are great?!? oh are we talking pizza or people?
[0:14:54] <@commanderclaw> Pepperoni is fine on an all meat, but it's terrible by itself
[0:14:55] <%saadi90> It’s haram!
[0:14:55] <%dankjerri> a cheese
[0:14:57] <%JamesCorck> What are we doing today on Mass Effect 2, Brain?
[0:14:57] <nyacoo> even pineapple
[0:14:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I hope we go to planet Toe Chunks today.
[0:14:59] <$lumporr> it's like putting your dick through a popcorn, but like 15 guys putting their dicks through all the pepperonis that were cut out
[0:14:59] <bob900000> pineapple
[0:15:02] <%Faustgesicht> True!
[0:15:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PINEAPPLE?
[0:15:02] <Latija> mushrooms?
[0:15:03] <%dekkitout> Olive and spinach? tajRLY
[0:15:03] <%AzureGale> Even pineapple?
[0:15:03] <%mads_valentine> Peas Pizza
[0:15:04] <brisk_dacat> Buffalo chicken
[0:15:04] <olaksi> ok, what counts as regular pizza
[0:15:04] <%king_wragles> Anchovy and mushroom is-OH OKAY
[0:15:04] <Profmcstevie> Peppeloni and Choese
[0:15:04] <%Dakuu75> bacon
[0:15:06] <%ssjklyco> Salami is a good substitute
[0:15:07] <%ape_hawk> pat, did you know that kentucky is the only us state that starts with the letter K?
[0:15:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> olives are disgusting
[0:15:09] <%McSoliace> edgiest opinion i honestly think he has
[0:15:10] <spookykrow> fair enough
[0:15:11] <%Maids4lyfe> pepperoni is the only pizza wtf
[0:15:11] <$RealThiele> Hawaiian pizza
[0:15:12] <%kknutson4> BBQ Chicken pizza is good
[0:15:12] <%BigCoffee> So just swap pepperonis with sausage bites?
[0:15:13] <+Punchasaur> You’ve HAD to eat it?
[0:15:17] <%RubberFistFight> No pepperoni or anchovies? BOO THIS MAN.
[0:15:19] <$SGrim> @RealThiele You can put pineapple on both, but I don't recommend it.
[0:15:25] <+polothegreatest> pineapple+ham
[0:15:26] <%dekkitout> Had 3 too many pizza parties as a kid
[0:15:26] <%spitelite> it looks like your nipples?
[0:15:27] <%DorianCreed> Oil?
[0:15:27] <%g4mejoy> I get it, pepperonis are too salty for me. A cheese is good for me, and a supreme has other stuff to dilute the pepperoni salt.
[0:15:32] <%ironohki> Ah, pizza.
[0:15:33] <+chester804> how are you feeling today Pat?
[0:15:37] <%Faustgesicht> @PatStaresAt Sausage and Mushroom yo
[0:15:40] <%bassoontyphoon> Meat lovers is the best pizza followed by Hawaiian
[0:15:42] <%JoshManVGH> Pepperoni, meatball, garlic is god tier pizza.
[0:15:46] <%ape_hawk> ligma balls
[0:15:47] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:15:48] <%dankjerri> cheese
[0:15:53] <%ironohki> Big agree Pepperoni needs to come down on the leaderboard.
[0:15:54] <%NateyBeak> oh its always pepperoni...
[0:15:55] <Profmcstevie> Oh you've been overexposed
[0:15:56] <Sotetsu> Pepperoni Pizza Pie Peephole!
[0:15:59] <%McSoliace> they didn't have cheese pizza
[0:16:02] <+BurningWigEmissary> school pizza was both bomb and shit
[0:16:07] <%BigCoffee> It's the base
[0:16:08] <%AzureGale> Oh you're a pizza hipster :p
[0:16:08] <Zeif00> Nothing BUT pepperoni
[0:16:09] <%dekkitout> Boomers raised their kids to have shit tastes in toppings like pepperoni
[0:16:11] <$RealThiele> pizza sauce is a vegetable in the US for the kids
[0:16:14] <spookykrow> one the pepperoni formed on pats chest he became averse to pepperoni on pizza must be ?
[0:16:17] <knotsundownsyndrome> god i wish i could read
[0:16:18] <@commanderclaw> All Dress?
[0:16:19] <+Punchasaur> Pepperoni and sausage with bacon bits tho
[0:16:21] <%Shubreaker> 2 pepp, 2 cheese
[0:16:25] <%ssjklyco> I don't think you've given Pepperoni a fair shot despite not liking it every time (End of joke)
[0:16:26] <%postalnerd787> peparoni is the basic bitch of pizzas
[0:16:28] <%dankjerri> oldres?
[0:16:30] <+Punchasaur> And garlic sauce
[0:16:30] <%dekkitout> All dress is a supreme pizza right?
[0:16:32] <+DatFooGamma> I use to do strictly cheese thanks to Home Alone
[0:16:32] <$RealThiele> all dress= suprme
[0:16:33] <PanicSwytch> All Dressed????
[0:16:33] <%Dakuu75> "all dress"?
[0:16:34] <%AzureGale> @Punchasaur The perfect pizza
[0:16:35] <Profmcstevie> Pepperoni is easy to take off usually
[0:16:37] <%RubberFistFight> @commanderclaw i think that's what they call super supreme over there in Canada.
[0:16:37] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Yo Pat, why you lying on twitter? You totally watched Witcher's endings on YT...
[0:16:39] <%BigCoffee> So you had bad peperone pizza for years, I'm sorry for you
[0:16:39] <bob900000> have you ever had good pepperoni
[0:16:40] <ioci2112> bimmy and jimmy
[0:16:45] <%MichaelDood> You knew Jammy too?
[0:16:47] <$lumporr> ya gotta get good pepperonis. crispy and curled
[0:16:47] <%dankjerri> its a fuckin supreme,
[0:16:47] <%g4mejoy> All Dressed is probably 4 meat or Supreme
[0:16:48] <%Dakuu75> @RealThiele thanks.
[0:16:48] <+BurningWigEmissary> soak it in garlic butter
[0:16:49] <Leaferson> For me it's always a 2/3 pepperoni and 1/3 cheese everywhere I go
[0:16:49] <%bhp_99> do you like pineapple on pizza?
[0:16:50] <%maskofmichael> sausage pizza is best
[0:16:51] <+chester804> this is the realist conversation ever!
[0:16:54] <spawnzie> fuck
[0:16:55] <%ape_hawk> my favorite thing to do with pizza is see how many napkins it takes to remove the surface area of its grease
[0:16:55] <+Daigrey> Bet David Jaffe LOVES pepperoni
[0:16:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PEPPERONI IS SO GOOD THO
[0:16:55] <%ExpressNode> I remember a pizza job I had and I had to make the weirdest pizzas. Hawaiian pizza to me is strange
[0:16:56] <%FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt What is this All Dressed thing you mention?
[0:16:57] <%AzureGale> Fuck a pizza, what?
[0:16:57] <Latija> what is pizza but pepperoni enduring
[0:16:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> All dressed is Canadian for Deluxe
[0:17:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> Good pepperoni is homemade
[0:17:01] <%BigCoffee> @bob900000 even if he did, you dont find that on the average pizza
[0:17:01] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You should have said you'll only eat cheese only pizza
[0:17:02] <@commanderclaw> It's always greasy
[0:17:02] <%ironohki> The loudest person is always the most right. Everyone knows this.
[0:17:02] <%Garthunox> Pat, Anthem is 2.79 on PSN and thats still too much
[0:17:02] <%EsotericOdyssey> pepperoni is better with supporting toppings like bacon
[0:17:03] <+megaman_sentinel> yeah f*** Billy and Jimmy
[0:17:05] <HarshNerf> I was that pepperoni kid, no ragrets
[0:17:06] <+chester804> this is so not fucking wrong its a crime lol
[0:17:06] <PanicSwytch> So why not call it supreme
[0:17:08] <%JoshManVGH> 2 pepperoni pizzas, a cheese, and a Hawaiin was always the combination an old job went with for pizza party rewards
[0:17:08] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Do you just hate all default foods then?
[0:17:10] <%BigCoffee> pepeorni, mushrooms, bell peppers
[0:17:11] <%Faustgesicht> Supreme

[0:17:34] <%g4mejoy> Supreme, Combination, or Deluxe
[0:17:34] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt I grew up in a hippie town, so I had the opposite issue. Can't look a spinach and ricotta slice in the eye without horrible food flashbacks.
[0:17:37] <%BigCoffee> In quebec canada?! Pat where the hell did you get all dressed with olives !?
[0:17:42] <%Dakuu75> oh god... not more twitter bull-shit. lol

[0:17:49] <PanicSwytch> @dakuu75 LUL thanks
[0:17:50] <bob900000> NotLikeThis
[0:17:51] <%dekkitout> My only issue to pineapple on pizza, as someone who like pineapple, is when the pineapples arent drained before going in the oven
[0:17:52] <$RealThiele> the crunch
[0:17:54] <%AzureGale> Can't sleep. Something is WRONG on the internet
[0:17:54] <%UvBenServed> psaGoblin
[0:17:56] <%BigCoffee> @Dakuu75 Where do you think we are
[0:17:56] <%JoshManVGH> All Dressed Potato Chips are what came to mind, and I was confused.
[0:17:58] <+robosqueeb> 4K
[0:18:00] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat I thought tim Horton's was an exclusive Canada thing, but I saw one today driving in backwoods Ohio
[0:18:01] <%Mathochism> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:18:04] <+Punchasaur> Onion bits are good on pizza for a nice cronch
[0:18:05] <$Futurecity10> its a real shame you cant play good games because of your insanity
[0:18:05] <%valriot> Still playing Nioh? Kappa
[0:18:09] <%mikeriffic> but the hack and lsah
[0:18:10] <%rekinom> @dekkitout Very true
[0:18:10] <%mikeriffic> slah
[0:18:13] <%ExpressNode> Fair enough if you played through it.
[0:18:15] <$RealThiele> i cant wait for the podcast after that twitter moment
[0:18:21] <+chester804> There was also alot of Dragon Age talk going on, played the 3rd one, didn't think it was bad
[0:18:31] <%mikesapartment> branch endings are fine
[0:18:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[0:18:34] <%FutaSnek> Thats fair
[0:18:35] <PanicSwytch> Same
[0:18:37] <%g4mejoy> Yeah, I get that.
[0:18:38] <%bhp_99> you played yourself in that sense
[0:18:39] <%Shubreaker> you did it for Baldur's Gate 2 tho
[0:18:39] <Dova573> Ok but you already beat that game 4 times you earned that ending already
[0:18:41] <RatloreTheIdiot> how else are you gonna see it then
[0:18:41] <%Dakuu75> @BigCoffee I'm worried he's committingmore murders
[0:18:46] <%McSoliace> it seemed like people were more civil today about your goblins today than normal
[0:18:47] <Broken_Sonex> ..........What?
[0:18:48] <stantheman_97> i can understand that
[0:18:48] <%FutaSnek> I have such a shit memory I usually forget KEKW
[0:18:48] <$lumporr> that's respectable
[0:18:50] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt If you skip dialogue and cutscenes, you can blast through Nier Replicant in like 3 hours per run through
[0:18:51] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[0:18:51] <%dankjerri> I watch game movies, i have no shame
[0:18:52] <%Garthunox> Then just skip the sidequests
[0:18:53] <+ChaosEmralds> "you not only cheated the game, you cheated yourself"
[0:18:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oh goooooood
[0:18:59] <RatloreTheIdiot> pat you seem to really like nier tho
[0:18:59] <$RealThiele> witcher Zzz
[0:19:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> thats the worst take yet
[0:19:09] <T_Sasquatch> Same, i really don't want to get those dumb weapons. Kinda hate how much you replay nier replicant
[0:19:11] <+BigBlackBankai> Shadow the Hedgehog tho?
[0:19:12] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt is this one of the "rules you set for yourself or else" parts of OCD?
[0:19:17] <%BioHunter> BioHunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:19:25] <%KaiserMario> But you did watch hem
[0:19:26] <%BioHunter> almost 2 yrs baby
[0:19:27] <Broken_Sonex> I watch LP's of games I like but don't bother to play, because fuck it
[0:19:27] <nyacoo> So it's irrational, alright
[0:19:29] <%dekkitout> I look up endings guides *if* I give a damn about the story up to a point
[0:19:33] <+ScrapKingKeita> the new story content was in the Nier Replicant Novellas
[0:19:34] <+robosqueeb> But you watched them
[0:19:39] <srv4254> i skipped most sidequests
[0:19:40] <+BigBruthaThunda> would be
[0:19:40] <%ExpressNode> Both?
[0:19:40] <%Dakuu75> sounds like, looking up the bad-ending in bioshock, after playing and getting the good ending
[0:19:40] <Alzero83> Lies
[0:19:42] <%g4mejoy> I don't think that's an OCD thing
[0:19:54] <%FutaSnek> Its just a matter of spoilers
[0:19:54] <%dankjerri> play through another 100 hours to do one single choice over
[0:19:55] <+FxyDEV> did you play Final Fantasy 2
[0:19:55] <+wmeldrum> "you can't walk on the sidwalk cracks"
[0:20:00] <bob900000> LUL
[0:20:01] <Broken_Sonex> "Fun"
[0:20:01] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Sorry if you covered it already, but what about the end of Yorha Dark Apocalypse? Thoughts?
[0:20:02] <@commanderclaw> We *are* awful
[0:20:09] <%BigCoffee> But people apply their logic too much to you. Does that kinda piss you off?
[0:20:16] <$RealThiele> until
[0:20:17] <+ChaosEmralds> he's pretty strong.
[0:20:21] <%JamesCorck> Honestly Pat, since I've known you I've started to call mind goblins to my anxiety, so don't worry about applying your logic to us.
[0:20:23] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:20:24] <$Ziegsy> Pat, sakuna of rice and ruin is fun. its on sale too
[0:20:25] <+dante_must_die_exe> WHAT LUL

[0:20:28] <%Garthunox> And pat, someone brought up disco elysium, apart from the excellent writing, how come that didnt activate the gobolins?
[0:20:33] <balthazar758> @BigCoffee i bet it does
[0:20:34] <+ChaosEmralds> welp.
[0:20:34] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Oh he's talking about the Jaffe shit?
[0:20:35] <$RealThiele> BIG ESCALATION
[0:20:35] <peyodogo> i have ocd and tend to agree with your goblins, idk, are we broken or what
[0:20:37] <$SGrim> DISH, PATRIC
[0:20:39] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i think part of what drives people to scream at you so often is their failure (or refusal) to recognise that when you go off on one of your bents it's EXPLICITLY how you see the world, not how you think everyone else should.
[0:20:44] <%dekkitout> Mr "Colonize Her Blussy" Feels

[0:21:32] <%Varlinator> Varlinator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! EYYYYYY 2 YEARS, or whatever! Thanks for all the good laughs & entertainment, really been helping the depression through these goddamn shit times we're all in. BTW 100% with you on going full Snowden on the camera while offline. Pepperoni's awesome tho.
[0:21:33] <%Kitafin> Fight this man
[0:21:34] <%JamesCorck> Hey Pat, one of my friends played Andromeda before playing ME1. How's that for mind goblins?
[0:21:35] <$Futurecity10> Fuck 1 and 2
[0:21:35] <+BigBruthaThunda> Blussy loyalty mission?
[0:21:36] <%ExpressNode> I started with Persona 2 innocent sin
[0:21:36] <olaksi> i feel like x-2 fans only look at the combat system and nothing else
[0:21:37] <mak0t0yukii> I started with persona 3 too
[0:21:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I watched the original Star Wars Trilogy backwards as a kid
[0:21:37] <+robosqueeb> smt4 was my first also
[0:21:38] <%BigCoffee> ff 10-x is a fucking hard sequel
[0:21:39] <%MassConnect> I started with Metal Gear Solid
[0:21:41] <%Arkfyre> What do you mean? Persona 3 is the first one
[0:21:41] <%dankjerri> 1 and 2 dont really matter
[0:21:41] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt You asked on twitter about the Ys series and I wanna mention that the games are narratively, told out of order, because the meta narrative is that you're basically playing novelizations of the main character's in-universe exploits
[0:21:42] <%sporeian94> 2 is the hipster game, 1 is garbage
[0:21:44] <%ComfortableStranger> started and ended with p5
[0:21:44] <%ssjklyco> Persona isn't really actual continuity though.
[0:21:44] <$lumporr> @D00msDayDan completely ruined, unsalvageable
[0:21:47] <$RealThiele> i tried starting with SMT 4 and bounced the fuck off that shit
[0:21:48] <%JoshManVGH> Play 13-2, then 13, then Lightning returns.
[0:21:49] <%washicka> @NateyBeak Oh god that would be so confusing
[0:21:51] <bob900000> I hear 2 is good
[0:21:52] <%Garthunox> PERSONA STORIES ARENT CONNECTED!
[0:21:54] <tentavision> they're mostly not story connected though
[0:21:59] <+Punchasaur> Do what I did and avoid both because tidas sucks
[0:21:59] <%weissguard> Persona doesn't have an ongoing story between 2 &3, so that's fine
[0:22:00] <srv4254> i started at mgs3 and regret nothing
[0:22:01] <%BigCoffee> 3 was a trial in a new style, it could have hard failed and it didn't
[0:22:04] <%dankjerri> persona True 3
[0:22:04] <iosephe> No, Persona
[0:22:05] <@commanderclaw> If it's not connected then who cares?
[0:22:08] <%BigCoffee> which is why we all get the same style
[0:22:08] <%ShawnTK_> 3, 4, and 5 have referenced them tho
[0:22:09] <%BigCoffee> now
[0:22:12] <$Solid_Stro> Started Mass Effect 2 before going back to 1 now that the Legendary Edition came out
[0:22:13] <%Mattais88> Play Mass Effect 3, then 2, then 1
[0:22:15] <+FxyDEV> Did you start with SMt 1
[0:22:16] <%ssjklyco> Couldn't tat apply to most Final fantasy gamess now?
[0:22:17] <PanicSwytch> I started with Persona 5 and now im REALLY interested in the others and Smt
[0:22:17] <Profmcstevie> You get A SINGLE callback or maybe even two callbacks between each entry
[0:22:18] <%sporeian94> Persona 2 the last three bosses are literally aliens, hitler, and dad
[0:22:19] <$RealThiele> mara connection
[0:22:19] <$DocMadfox> Cheer500 Working my way through the VoDs while playing through the old versions of Mass Effect 1 - 3 with heavy mods. Can't wait to not play any other games out of depression for three months after finishing this again like the ME3 ending left me the first time. No that's not hyperbole for the vanilla ending, that actually was the result of my first playthrough. Anyway enjoy the not-Star Trek game and have some money.
[0:22:21] <bob900000> what about starting at mgs 4
[0:22:22] <Broken_Sonex> Persona games aren't really connected anyway
[0:22:23] <%dekkitout> I love starting a series at a midway/late entry for the explicit purpose of having little appreciation for the old/returning casts
[0:22:23] <Kraftium> persona 1 manga is very cool
[0:22:23] <Blank9> More in common than SMT2 to 3
[0:22:25] <olaksi> @ShawnTK_ not the point
[0:22:25] <+polothegreatest> never finish p3 and never reach truth on p4
[0:22:31] <%EsotericOdyssey> is persona 6 gonna be green or something
[0:22:32] <%spitelite> and a lot of other smt games share those too
[0:22:33] <marvel877> I still have only played P3.
[0:22:33] <peyodogo> persona 2 is incredible
[0:22:35] <+BigBlackBankai> Are MG 1 and 2 even canon?
[0:22:39] <%EsotericOdyssey> since 3 was blue, 4 was yellow, and 5 was reed
[0:22:39] <+wmeldrum> tried going back to 1 after beating 2.... cant do it
[0:22:45] <Profmcstevie> Ease of access to the games
[0:22:54] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Persona 2 is so goddamn good though!
[0:22:56] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> To be fair, ME1 wasn't on PS3 if thats the context
[0:22:57] <%EsotericOdyssey> *red
[0:23:03] <+Punchasaur> Persona 6 should be purple
[0:23:05] <Dragovus> @EsotericOdyssey That's been the theory for years. No real word behind it
[0:23:07] <+megaman_sentinel> no you can't
[0:23:09] <+RowenCleric> mass effect 1 wasnt on ps3, I had to start with 2
[0:23:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 2 makes 1 not fun
[0:23:15] <%cvp5127> videogames were a mstake
[0:23:16] <%Dakuu75> "That's rough buddy"
[0:23:18] <+robosqueeb> @PatStaresAt I started ME3 after getting inspired to play them after your stream and found the game auto sets your difficulty to casual and theres even an option to have the game pick choices for you
[0:23:18] <+ScrapKingKeita> OH BOY LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEING A DISGAEA FAN
[0:23:19] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt I brought this up on Twitter, but Cold Steel 1 is a fine starting point
[0:23:19] <satans_finest_millennial> my partner was playing P5 on launch and i thought i heard Jamiroquai and now i want P5R on steam now god damn take my monies
[0:23:21] <%BigCoffee> It's rough but if you're a story fiend you can handle it.
[0:23:27] <+FxyDEV> FF1 was fine after playing 7
[0:23:30] <wolfen091> hence the confusion on why ppl like me1
[0:23:30] <+wmeldrum> i was told to go back to 1 to appreciated HOW MUCH of an improvement 2 is. Couldn't do it.
[0:23:33] <+megaman_sentinel> P4 to P3
[0:23:33] <Daxalog> But sometimes you get to see how awful the new games are
[0:23:33] <%NateyBeak> play dead space 3 first then play 2 and be like WOAH THIs iS GREAT
[0:23:34] <$RealThiele> watch TNG season 1 after season 4
[0:23:35] <balthazar758> oh boy
[0:23:38] <Kraftium> yeah start with DMC2 and then go back to 1 later
[0:23:40] <%Shubreaker> nocturne
[0:23:41] <%dekkitout> Any SMT game before the 'S'
[0:23:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ugggggh that's oooooold
[0:23:45] <%BigCoffee> @FxyDEV but which ff1, the NES one or one of the 5 remakes
[0:23:47] <%ExpressNode> Persona 2 is hard to go back to after trying later entries. Innocent sin is alright but Persona 2 eternal punishment is spoiled milk
[0:23:49] <+ChaosEmralds> nocturne HD fixed that
[0:23:49] <%maskofmichael> If gameplay sucks but story is good, just watch cutscenes
[0:23:51] <%cvp5127> p4 to p3p was fine
[0:23:54] <nyacoo> Enjoy dragon quest 11? Just go back to dq1
[0:23:54] <Basch71> remaster fixes that
[0:23:55] <$Solid_Stro> Oh yeah, Mass Effect 1 is a slog after spending so much time with ME2 c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[0:23:55] <%ssjklyco> SMT 3 now, with the remaster
[0:23:55] <DarthCookius> What about the people that say "start with ps2 Yakuza"
[0:23:56] <%solracc25> Going from KH 2 to KH 1 it's rough
[0:23:56] <Sirtimbob> I just turned on the video and thought it froze, but pat was just pausing for effect
[0:23:57] <+ScrapKingKeita> Strange Journeys let you select, if memory serves
[0:24:01] <bob900000> what about final fantasy
[0:24:02] <Profmcstevie> 4?! BUT THE NEW GAME IS 5, HOW IS IT ALL BAD?!
[0:24:06] <+EmptyMug> Fallout 3 to Fallout 2 is rough
[0:24:08] <+FxyDEV> @FxyDEV GBA
[0:24:14] <%dankjerri> psaWrong psaWrong
[0:24:17] <Dunmarkh> played soul hackers like that, it was fine
[0:24:20] <%justcallmebobplease> It's proto-Gatcha, of course it's bad
[0:24:23] <+FxyDEV> LUL
[0:24:26] <%maskofmichael> @solracc25 Going from KH 2 to KH 3 is rough
[0:24:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> BASED
[0:24:28] <Hairy_butts> LUL
[0:24:29] <%dekkitout> Pat, when's the last you played Fo2
[0:24:29] <%rekinom> @Profmcstevie those are persona games, he's talking about megaten games
[0:24:29] <%dankjerri> The Master is still the best
[0:24:30] <$Futurecity10> all 4 are good
[0:24:31] <%ape_hawk> try fallout 4 to NV
[0:24:31] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[0:24:34] <%MidnightBurst12> gottem
[0:24:34] <%ExpressNode> SMT IV isn't too hard to go back to I think.
[0:24:35] <+wmeldrum> street fighter 2 to 1?
[0:24:36] <RatloreTheIdiot> i liked them both in differnet ways
[0:24:36] <%dekkitout> It dont hold up well
[0:24:37] <+manasaurusrex03> Fall Out 4 backwards to NV
[0:24:38] <%Ranryu692> ME2 is rough after playing ME3
[0:24:41] <Dova573> Thats why you start at new vegas
[0:24:42] <%Faustgesicht> Fallout New vegas to 4 is super rough
[0:24:43] <$antibonehurtingjuice> I will die on the F3 hill
[0:24:44] <+robosqueeb> Fallout 2 is better than one in infinite ways
[0:24:48] <+ChaosEmralds> i dont like isometric things like F 1 and 2
[0:24:52] <+FxyDEV> no one played GTA 1 and 2
[0:24:57] <Deko_> 4 is kinda okay
[0:24:58] <%Dakuu75> I don't think my brain would physically allow me to play game 2, before game 1
[0:24:59] <%dekkitout> It sucks on BOTH ends tajCRY
[0:25:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[0:25:01] <+SocialMisfitGamer> BUT YOU LOVE NEW VEGAS!
[0:25:02] <%ComfortableStranger> that's what i did
[0:25:03] <%Garthunox> @antibonehurtingjuice No one will show up to kill you, dont worry
[0:25:10] <%ssjklyco> Yakuzies Kiwami 2 to Yakuzies 3
[0:25:11] <%ComfortableStranger> still enjoyed NV
[0:25:11] <%BigCoffee> I'd rather play fallout 1-2 then 4
[0:25:12] <%dankjerri> oh no the game is bad
[0:25:13] <+BigBlackBankai> RDR2 to RDR is suprisingly good.
[0:25:16] <SaltyAzteca> Just in time, classes just finished
[0:25:16] <%mikeriffic> but those dialogue options
[0:25:16] <$Solid_Stro> ME1 is a goddamn slog if you started with ME2 c4sageLUL
[0:25:22] <+ChaosEmralds> i had the opposite reaction from NV to 4
[0:25:22] <%Mothman007> ME2 is easily the WORST in the series, it's just a slog with a bunch of retcons and boring powers and combat
[0:25:23] <+polothegreatest> why am always out of waterr
[0:25:26] <%dekkitout> I like 4's gameplay and hate the world, and vice versa for NV
[0:25:27] <niffinbox> dmc5 to dmc1
[0:25:27] <@commanderclaw> It's also why yakuza 3 remastered sucks so hard coming off of Kiwami 2
[0:25:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah 4 was a vast improvement gameplay wise
[0:25:34] <Dunmarkh> fallout 4 made power armor so much fucking cooler, hard to go back
[0:25:34] <%OrangeMDT> Can’t run, but can talk
[0:25:35] <%za7az> Pat why are you describing my sex life? Kappa
[0:25:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah if you haven't had the Bethesda bad feel already it's a bit of a shock
[0:25:37] <%BigCoffee> @Mothman007 the fuck are you on
[0:25:41] <$DocMadfox> Fallout 4's gameplay is fucking great, but god the story is dog shit.
[0:25:42] <%sunsetdisc0> it's a tradeoff for the story lol
[0:25:46] <+even_the_yuenglings> yeah I started with me2 so me1 was so clunky to me
[0:25:49] <%Shubreaker> the way NV feels is why I stopped playing Outer Worlds after the second planet
[0:25:50] <%Maids4lyfe> ME2 is the best wtf
[0:25:51] <%Ranryu692> ME1 has the best story, ME2 has the best cast, ME3 has the best gameplay
[0:25:52] <stantheman_97> fallout nv is one of my favorite games and BOY is the gameplay fucked
[0:25:53] <%BigCoffee> fallout 4 made important things from before feel too cheap and easy
[0:25:56] <BigFingerRo> Yo, you guys, I just got a GAMER(tm) themed ad for condoms, where they invited us, the consumer gamers, to level up but never without protection! Cool huh?
[0:25:57] <$antibonehurtingjuice> @antibonehurtingjuice Perish upset
[0:26:02] <Profmcstevie> evolution of controls is a BIG DEAL
[0:26:02] <Daniel_Is_I> Just go play Monster Hunter 1
[0:26:04] <%Dakuu75> I like seeing 2 different ppl going "ME 1 is a slog", "but, ME 2 is the BIGGEST slog"
[0:26:04] <+CookieCutter007> gotta mod the shit out of NV
[0:26:04] <$DocMadfox> I legitimately like settlement building and I think there's too many settlements to build.
[0:26:05] <%dekkitout> Going back to any pokemon game pre blaxk/white SUCKS
[0:26:09] <Broken_Sonex> What do you want good gameplay or good writing?
[0:26:09] <%ComfortableStranger> @Mothman007 wait, you think the powers were better in me1 than me2?
[0:26:10] <+Punchasaur> Bloodborne to OG Demons souls
[0:26:11] <Dragovus> Time was only meant to run in one direction
[0:26:16] <Djinnazz> what?
[0:26:16] <%za7az> @BigFingerRo VERY cool Jay
[0:26:16] <%maskofmichael> Going from RE2 remake to RE2 original
[0:26:21] <%NateyBeak> I played mgs3 on the ds, i have problem :>
[0:26:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> lol I played 3 first
[0:26:23] <%ExpressNode> I feel like SNES games are probably the easiest games to go back to
[0:26:23] <wolfen091> yet people like 3 more
[0:26:28] <T_Sasquatch> Fucking finally someone admits it
[0:26:28] <%doctordinkus> But mgs3 has ape escape munkee
[0:26:29] <+FxyDEV> oh the fixed camera in og snake eater
[0:26:31] <satans_finest_millennial> ME3 blue ball pistol is GOD
[0:26:31] <Djinnazz> oh original MGS3
[0:26:34] <%JamesCorck> Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness?
[0:26:37] <%dankjerri> MGS4 is still the best
[0:26:41] <+polothegreatest> love kojimas movies
[0:26:41] <$RealThiele> genius kojumbo
[0:26:42] <PanicSwytch> The only problem imo is the camara
[0:26:43] <Djinnazz> Ehh
[0:26:43] <T_Sasquatch> I love mgs2. I can't stand mgs3
[0:26:43] <$Ziegsy> Bloodborne ro ps3 demons souls made me feel like a GOD
[0:26:48] <%Eilocke> don't tell Super Bunnyhop you trashed the fixed camera
[0:26:48] <Dunmarkh> controlled great on the 3ds
[0:26:48] <%EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt did you like Pillars of Eternity 2's turn-based mode? Because that makes me unable to go back to Pillars 1's combat.
[0:26:49] <%shurtal> Subsistance only
[0:26:49] <niffinbox> oh god tomb raider
[0:26:50] <marvel877> oof, that OG Snake Eater camera.
[0:26:52] <+even_the_yuenglings> god the me3 gameplay is so good Kreygasm
[0:26:52] <+megaman_sentinel> sustenance
[0:26:52] <Afterman_> man i LOVE the original MGO,that shit was godly
[0:26:53] <%ComfortableStranger> It's ben a long time since I've played snake eater, but i don't remember the control issues
[0:26:56] <%Dakuu75> once you hit the "quality checkpoint" of a recent game. You usually don't wanna go back
[0:26:57] <DatAsuna> With the one exception of the bike chase
[0:26:58] <%ainzhelm> Jacob is garbo, but I actually like his loyalty mission. Adds nothing to him, but nice self contained side mission
[0:27:00] <%doctordinkus> Also mgs3 on 3ds is the worst port in human history
[0:27:00] <@commanderclaw> Level design is underappreciated
[0:27:02] <%lucaflowe> Oh base 3 yeah it's bad
[0:27:05] <%Mothman007> At least biotics don't become useless when a shield exists
[0:27:09] <+manasaurusrex03> I started with snake eater and it was just not fun to play and stopped immediately
[0:27:16] <kikoeru_san> Child me returned MGS3 for Okami because of how bad it felt
[0:27:19] <%mikeriffic> nailed it
[0:27:21] <%Dakuu75> flaws?
[0:27:21] <Afterman_> devolution
[0:27:21] <SaltyAzteca> g-gottem?
[0:27:23] <stantheman_97> 3 original had a fixed camera???
[0:27:23] <%dankjerri> degradations
[0:27:24] <Daniel_Is_I> Regressions
[0:27:24] <Dunmarkh> de-evolution
[0:27:24] <knotsundownsyndrome> downgrades
[0:27:24] <ToneBacas> no
[0:27:25] <$lumporr> misunderestimated
[0:27:25] <+Garrygutterfilth> big brain moment
[0:27:26] <+FxyDEV> @PatStaresAt Street Fighter 2 Turbo still timeless
[0:27:27] <DatAsuna> MGS4 MGO2 was the peak for me
[0:27:27] <PanicSwytch> Yeah sure...
[0:27:27] <%Eilocke> unprovements
[0:27:27] <+JaseAdrift> nope
[0:27:27] <$RealThiele> regression
[0:27:28] <%ComfortableStranger> I played 1, 3, than 5
[0:27:30] <%mads_valentine> Disprovements.
[0:27:31] <%dekkitout> Determents?
[0:27:31] <%Varlinator> The OG MGS3 with the fixed camera was rough.
[0:27:33] <satans_finest_millennial> foilbales
[0:27:33] <%JamesCorck> Downgrades.
[0:27:33] <niffinbox> contempt
[0:27:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> I tried playing the earlier witcher games before I played 3
[0:27:39] <$DocMadfox> Artifacts
[0:27:39] <%doctordinkus> sacrifices
[0:27:42] <%dekkitout> *Detriment
[0:27:44] <%Varlinator> Passive Progressive
[0:27:45] <%JamesCorck> Upgrades VS Downgrades.
[0:27:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> So is Jacob worse than Kaidan or what
[0:27:45] <wolfen091> castlevania starts at symphony of the night
[0:27:47] <DatAsuna> I'll never forget that one asshole with the flashlight on his shotgun
[0:27:48] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:27:48] <+FxyDEV> for O.Sagat
[0:27:48] <stantheman_97> yes but no
[0:27:49] <BigFingerRo> Badfeels
[0:27:50] <%dankjerri> everything after 3rd strike feels no good
[0:27:50] <marvel877> desolations?
[0:27:52] <$Ziegsy> @reallybigrocks im so sorry
[0:27:53] <+FxyDEV> and only for O.Sagat
[0:27:54] <+AgniBrandt> I'm reminded of how I can NEVER go back to Pillars 1 after playing Pillars 2
[0:27:59] <%ExpressNode> I bought MGS4 but I haven't booted it up yet on my PS3. I feel bad
[0:28:01] <+polothegreatest> super rainbow edition
[0:28:02] <%OldOnyx> Hyper Fighting Exists
[0:28:06] <+ScrapKingKeita> Disgaea is kind of wild because Disgaea 5 was the worst written game in the series but played the best, then Disgaea 6 comes out and it plays worse than Disgaea 1
[0:28:07] <%dekkitout> So Sagat's a shoto right?
[0:28:08] <+wmeldrum> you can play as BOSSES???
[0:28:08] <$RealThiele> castlevania 4 for the snes was an still is amazing
[0:28:12] <+BigBlackBankai> Dead Rising is also good series to play earlier entries on.
[0:28:16] <+Punchasaur> The bads
[0:28:18] <Sirtimbob> Cheer500 hey pat. I love watching people go back and forth trying to make you like something they like and it reminds of the phrase “but i dont like fish” so people will tell you about this awesome sushi, “thats great but i dont like fish”, you dont understand its imported! “Thats great but i dont like fish” Youre wrong pat, the chef is a Master chef! “But i dont like fish”.
[0:28:18] <%BigCoffee> @AgniBrandt You could if you cared about pillars 1's story
[0:28:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm still crying over Iovara
[0:28:27] <%BigCoffee> Pat don't you have a king master SSD !?
[0:28:33] <Dunmarkh> runs fine on my machine
[0:28:33] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt Pokemon games always seem to take a step forward then remove several features from the previous game
[0:28:35] <%dankjerri> POE to Baldurs Gate though
[0:28:37] <+AgniBrandt> For me it's because per-encounter abilities are WAY easier on my mind goblins
[0:28:41] <%BigCoffee> welp ok
[0:28:52] <@commanderclaw> GELLARDE
[0:28:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> You just need an obscenely unnecessarily fast SSD
[0:28:55] <%dekkitout> @Pyr0_Fr0st Gimme back my gen 5 sprites ya phuckz
[0:28:57] <%ExpressNode> @ScrapKingKeita Oh boy I agree that its written badly but I think Disgaea D2 takes the cake
[0:28:59] <$Ziegsy> @scrapkingkeita just give me 4 remade with 5s mechanics. ultimate disgaea
[0:29:03] <%BigCoffee> Did you also do torment?
[0:29:05] <BigFingerRo> Which game was it that had a loading time of 20 FOTNS round loading times?
[0:29:08] <%dankjerri> THAC0 creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[0:29:09] <ioci2112> have you played underrail pat?
[0:29:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> POE 2's load times aren't great to begin with.
[0:29:11] <niffinbox> you gonna play the sifu game when it comes out pat
[0:29:15] <nyacoo> Some old games are better going back to with mods
[0:29:20] <@commanderclaw> Torment is good with a guide tbh
[0:29:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> THACK-OOOOH
[0:29:22] <$Futurecity10> Been going through baldur's gate again, man Kansei sucks ass
[0:29:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> And enough ram to load the whole game into memory
[0:29:30] <+wmeldrum> this applies to tabletop. going from dnd5e to 4/3 is a nightmare
[0:29:31] <%BigCoffee> See torment like Aegis 13. Amazing story with an ok gameplay
[0:29:33] <DatAsuna> Woolie keeps talking like he might do torment one day but idk
[0:29:37] <tattleworm> torment's the only recent obsidian rpg i didn't bounce off of
[0:29:40] <+Punchasaur> Automata to drakenguard 1
[0:29:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Yo there's no missable content in Berseria just some minor dialogue you can miss
[0:29:41] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat elite dangerous
[0:29:43] <+polothegreatest> yaaay steam ssalee
[0:29:47] <SaltyAzteca> THE BACKLOG BECKONS
[0:29:48] <tattleworm> wait, torment? tyranny.
[0:29:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:29:52] <%dekkitout> You know what's rough, playing a shooter that doesn't have ledge grab tajCRY
[0:29:53] <%valriot> LUL
[0:29:55] <stantheman_97> just do it
[0:29:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Give in, just play Euro Truck Sim
[0:29:59] <Profmcstevie> I got a game called Kunai, and it's fun :)
[0:30:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> @ExpressNode Disgaea D2 does interesting stuff and is at least tonally, a Disgaea game. 5's plot is literally pointless because of the post game, which also ruined Asagi
[0:30:02] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Will we see more PS5 availability next year? I really wanna play that Ratchet & Clank game
[0:30:02] <%heartlesshealer> Bottomless Backlog
[0:30:03] <%ape_hawk> just wanted to let yall know that i started an evil playthrough of MELE as Karen Shepard. I call it the Karenegade Run.
[0:30:03] <+FxyDEV> I played AM2R before playing Metroid Zero Mission
[0:30:06] <%BigCoffee> Have you tried to delve into all the good boomer shooters that are our tight now? Prodeus, Amid Evil, etc?
[0:30:08] <%maskofmichael> NO TIME TO PLAY GAMES, YOU HAVE TO PLAY GAMES!
[0:30:10] <+CookieCutter007> Trails of cold steel is fun
[0:30:12] <DarthCookius> yo if I buy sekiro does Activision or from soft get the money
[0:30:12] <SilverFaustX> have u seen the windows 11 checker telling everyone they cant run it.
[0:30:13] <%tank7013> But Pat that one guy on twittwr siad you could just turn the goblins off
[0:30:15] <%dankjerri> no
[0:30:16] <DatAsuna> maybe?
[0:30:19] <+RowenCleric> Tyranny is so good, sad there will never be a sequel
[0:30:20] <+wmeldrum> "yes"
[0:30:21] <PanicSwytch> Nah
[0:30:21] <$RealThiele> no
[0:30:26] <vonmaultke> staring at new good games thinking "I need to be in the right mindset for this"
[0:30:28] <+SocialMisfitGamer> MAAAAAAAAAYBE
[0:30:28] <BigFingerRo> Hey @PatStaresAt speaking of frustrations, I just had to throw out the dough for a cake because it was a sticky horrible mess! Feels great
[0:30:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pffffft
[0:30:29] <%MidnightBurst12> who fucking knows
[0:30:30] <%dankjerri> FUCK
[0:30:30] <%Shubreaker> maybe
[0:30:31] <%Dakuu75> (owch)
[0:30:31] <%heartlesshealer> Hmmmmm
[0:30:32] <nyacoo> Scalpers: "It's free real estate"
[0:30:33] <bob900000> yikes
[0:30:36] <%dankjerri> OH N9
[0:30:37] <%JoshManVGH> ...so how 'bout that Scarlet Nexus?
[0:30:38] <CrypticMochi> So no
[0:30:41] <%heartlesshealer> signs point to no
[0:30:42] <$Ziegsy> I have a friend who buys games if they are under $5 if he wven has a passing interest in them. because what do you loose? he shares some AMAZING games
[0:30:43] <stantheman_97> holy shit
[0:30:44] <%Varlinator> goddamn scalpers
[0:30:45] <+FennecZephyr> At least I'll have a lot of games to play
[0:30:46] <%dekkitout> By time the slim/pro versions are announced they'd have "cought up"
[0:30:47] <%heartlesshealer> thanks scalpers
[0:30:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Who's eating all the chips
[0:30:48] <bob900000> fuck scalpers
[0:30:48] <%ExpressNode> @ScrapKingKeita I think you're right now that I reflect a little
[0:30:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> its rough out here
[0:30:48] <%bread_assassin> I can't bring myself to play Cold Steel 4 after beating Cold Steel 3 because I haven't played the other five games in the series, and that is REALLY rough if you saw the end of Cold Steel 3.
[0:30:49] <+polothegreatest> nah, they will release the slim version with less plastic
[0:30:49] <PanicSwytch> Im good i can wait till 2023-24
[0:30:49] <@commanderclaw> Cars are getting fucked too
[0:30:50] <%maskofmichael> I think they just made up the PS5, as a joke.
[0:30:51] <%Ranryu692> blame crypto
[0:30:52] <%Dakuu75> Mega-Sad
[0:30:55] <falyden> this console generatation is fucked
[0:30:56] <%ComfortableStranger> @BigFingerRo did you flush it with the cereal?
[0:30:56] <+Punchasaur> NotLikeThis
[0:30:57] <%dankjerri> I WILL PERSONALLY DELIVER EVERYONES PS5
[0:30:57] <%doctordinkus> what a terrible console launch. like I understand why but fuck
[0:30:58] <SilverFaustX> best buy had ps5 today
[0:30:58] <marvel877> ...so you're saying buy a Switch then?
[0:31:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Just in time for them to release the ps5pro!
[0:31:02] <%Shubreaker> anyway, fuck crypto miners
[0:31:03] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's more than just supply/demand, there's a critical semiconductor shortage that was going ignored prior to the pandemic even hit, and they're still trying to money their way out of it. It's fucking stupid.
[0:31:03] <%SirGO0SE> its crazy because I don't know anyone who actually is trying to get one
[0:31:08] <+CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan why do they make chips only in Taiwan
[0:31:10] <TEAMATTACK13> that's fine. I'm working on my ps3 backlog til then. that and FF11
[0:31:10] <%mikesapartment> by then the ps5 pro will be out
[0:31:12] <%barkon345> so by the time they are available to most people the PS6 will be coming out soon
[0:31:17] <+FxyDEV> but will you remember
[0:31:17] <+FennecZephyr> Who cares, it's a JRPG
[0:31:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's not even scalpers y'all, it's a global microprocessor shortage due to unprecedented demand
[0:31:22] <+FennecZephyr> Just play it
[0:31:24] <%lucaflowe> Pat how can you play Dragon Quest fine but not YS?
[0:31:25] <BigFingerRo> @BigFingerRo no, I put it inside a plastic bag and THEN flushed it
[0:31:26] <Daniel_Is_I> PAT YOU PLAY MMOS
[0:31:32] <+swearinglotus> Do you have Digimon Cyber sleuth?
[0:31:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just do it tho
[0:31:40] <TEAMATTACK13> play a Tales of game!!
[0:31:42] <$RealThiele> gungeon it is
[0:31:46] <%heartlesshealer> beta and early access is always a limbo of "will it save?"
[0:31:47] <%Arkfyre> check out Tales of Berseria
[0:31:49] <%lucaflowe> Digimon Cyber Sleuth is amazing
[0:31:50] <bob900000> you haven't finished VLR?!
[0:31:54] <olaksi> VLR has the best stupid twists in games
[0:31:56] <%dankjerri> Im tellin ya Pat, you gotta play Elite Dangerous.
[0:31:56] <%Mattais88> I LOVE THAT GAME
[0:31:56] <%cvp5127> just stare at a wall
[0:31:59] <marvel877> I'm sitting here waiting for Walmart to get Disc PS5s because I have a big gift card I want to use to pay for it.
[0:31:59] <%weissguard> here we go
[0:32:00] <%MidnightBurst12> I feel that in my soul
[0:32:01] <%ComfortableStranger> loved Tales of berzeria!!
[0:32:02] <+Punchasaur> DQ XI has beautiful enemy animation
[0:32:06] <%bassoontyphoon> Just play Zeno Clash pat
[0:32:08] <%za7az> Have you finished Omori?
[0:32:08] <DatAsuna> berseria's okay, one of the weaker entires in the franchise
[0:32:09] <Daniel_Is_I> Could play Scarlet Nexus tomorrow.
[0:32:12] <+CookieCutter007> ResidentSleeper Zesteria
[0:32:18] <+polothegreatest> taste
[0:32:22] <%justcallmebobplease> What?
[0:32:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> The witch character in that game is hilarious.
[0:32:22] <marvel877> and then someone told you about mind goblins.
[0:32:23] <%BigCoffee> Skip everything and wait for Tales of Arise when it comes out. It's going to revolutionize the tales series
[0:32:25] <%ExpressNode> Really? I thought it was pretty simple
[0:32:26] <T_Sasquatch> Really ???
[0:32:26] <%dankjerri> play some fighting games
[0:32:27] <DatAsuna> Because Tales is all about big combo
[0:32:28] <%heartlesshealer> idk tales games just moved in that direction
[0:32:30] <%lucaflowe> Because it's a big combo game
[0:32:30] <%Garthunox> its not
[0:32:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Tales of Berseria has no missable content
[0:32:31] <$Ziegsy> Tales of zestiria asks you to complete the game 6 times for the platinum. i hate it
[0:32:33] <%Garthunox> its really not
[0:32:34] <%RubberFistFight> @ReallyBigRocks it's not "unprecedented demand", that's just what they're saying to avoid responsibility/make it the "consumer's fault". The shortage existed before the demand kicked off, and it had been forecast for LITERALLY YEARS and they did basically nothing about it, taking a "we'll ignore that bridge when we come to it" attitude instead.
[0:32:34] <Blank9> it's skits
[0:32:35] <XeroRaizer> XeroRaizer subscribed with Prime. 
[0:32:37] <bob900000> really?
[0:32:39] <+ScrapKingKeita> Wait, I thought it was Vesperia that has missable content, not Vesperia?
[0:32:40] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You gonna do a Metroid Marathon to get ready for Dread like you did for Resident Evil?
[0:32:40] <@commanderclaw> Oof, Tales is terrible for the psaGoblin
[0:32:41] <%JoshManVGH> Cause they gave you devil trigger.
[0:32:41] <%doctordinkus> we're gonna have to stop talking about godhand someday but not today
[0:32:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No game is perfect Pat LUL
[0:32:43] <$RealThiele> oof
[0:32:43] <%dekkitout> Do the backtrack shuffle SourPls
[0:32:44] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Red pat
[0:32:44] <DatAsuna> All the tales games have HUGE missable backtrack content
[0:32:44] <Latija> the backtracking is just for optional misc dialogue
[0:32:45] <%ComfortableStranger> shit I should try godhand then, I sailed through Berzeria
[0:32:47] <marvel877> nothing's more complicated than Godhand, Pat, that's a lie.
[0:32:47] <Afterman_> then the goblins consumed pat
[0:32:47] <%ShawnTK_> Berseria tells you on the world map where all the side stuff is when it pops up
[0:32:48] <DatAsuna> Tons of it
[0:32:48] <SilverFaustX> xillia 2 was the worst
[0:32:48] <+Punchasaur> Octopath is on pc so play that?
[0:32:49] <Laecerelius> I fucking hated Berseria's combat. I missed the old style of combat.
[0:32:49] <wolfen091> but pat you love backtracking, ever since resident evil
[0:32:49] <%Monkeyweed21> BERSERIA HAS NO MISSABLE CONTENT JUST DIALOGUE
[0:32:49] <+swearinglotus> if you want to waste money, check out dbz kakarot
[0:32:51] <%heartlesshealer> oh you mean the sidequests and skits
[0:32:52] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt All events are marked with a star on the map
[0:32:52] <%Garthunox> NO IT DOESNT
[0:33:01] <$RealThiele> give me townb portal cowards
[0:33:05] <+kortin> the skits ARE pretty fun
[0:33:06] <%ExpressNode> I still think Tales of Graces F has the best battle system
[0:33:07] <bob900000> it's not important
[0:33:07] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah EVERY tales game has that
[0:33:07] <+FennecZephyr> You don't need to see all of them, pat
[0:33:08] <%BigCoffee> It's important because the game is literally an anime show
[0:33:10] <DatAsuna> Skits and whole sidequests
[0:33:13] <DatAsuna> and tons of them
[0:33:15] <touhou_hijack> Hi Pat! Rarely catch these things live. Just wanted to thank you for getting me into FF14. It's really fun. Currently slogging through post ARR. Cheer1000
[0:33:17] <+robosqueeb> man it feels good to not care about that shit
[0:33:19] <%Garthunox> THE SKITS SUCK
[0:33:19] <$thesickestzak> Cheer500 David Jaffe eats corn the long way
[0:33:19] <tentavision> there's probably yt compilations for the skits
[0:33:20] <%Garthunox> FUCK EM
[0:33:21] <Profmcstevie> It's not the best shit fuck off, it's garbage dialogue attempts at building character
[0:33:21] <+AgniBrandt> Skits are great, but their importance is way overexaggerated I think
[0:33:24] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:33:24] <marvel877> The skits don't matter really.
[0:33:25] <$Futurecity10> YOU CAN
[0:33:26] <Blank9> you had to cheat to get all content multiple times already
[0:33:28] <+kortin> anyone who tells you that they aren't important doesn't understand how Tales games build characters
[0:33:30] <$Futurecity10> GOD DAMMIT I TOLD YOU
[0:33:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt I believe it is impossible to see every skit in 1 playthrough
[0:33:32] <+robosqueeb> you absolutely can
[0:33:34] <%Treuan> You can, I did it this week
[0:33:34] <doggieo> Skits are for cringe lovers. Which i am
[0:33:34] <DatAsuna> Vesperia is peak battle system but it takes a while to get all the mechanics
[0:33:35] <+JaseAdrift> YOU CAN
[0:33:37] <DatAsuna> You can
[0:33:40] <%bassoontyphoon> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:33:41] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE ALREADY MISSED CONTENT IN ME
[0:33:42] <%Varlinator> You can
[0:33:42] <%afronooch> you can. i did it last night
[0:33:43] <%ComfortableStranger> you can with save editor
[0:33:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat I LITERALLY DID IT LAST WEEK
[0:33:47] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Hiiiiii Pat! Hope you’re having a great day
[0:33:48] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> yes, you can. I did it a couple of weeks ago.
[0:33:49] <Captain0Punz> You can
[0:33:52] <$SGrim> It works
[0:33:53] <%dankjerri> just play Skullgirls, man
[0:33:55] <$Solid_Stro> Yes you can sabert14Gun
[0:33:57] <+rich_mon> pat might literally be losing his mind
[0:34:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do it for the Engineer Gams
[0:34:08] <+robosqueeb> it begins
[0:34:08] <%Rookie_Balboa> different character dialogue probably
[0:34:09] <%mikeriffic> You can but you have 1 mission between the IFF and the Collector base to save everyone...take to long after getting legion and your crew die on the collector base
[0:34:10] <$RealThiele> krogan vitality LUL
[0:34:15] <+scrublordsamurai> you doing paragon?
[0:34:15] <%Garthunox> yUP
[0:34:15] <+Punchasaur> Play Xcom
[0:34:17] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat just romance Kaidan
[0:34:18] <%BigCoffee> Wait did you do the DLC in ME1? I forgot
[0:34:18] <+BigBlackBankai> What's a few colonists?
[0:34:19] <%dekkitout> Or like character revisits/revisit set ups?
[0:34:27] <%Monkeyweed21> If you count party dialogue, like Mordin says a bunch of stuff in the thane mission @PatStaresAt
[0:34:28] <%heartlesshealer> think they mean take [ X ] on Y mission
[0:34:32] <%Mattais88> You have a guide open for missables in ME, why not Taales?
[0:34:34] <$Futurecity10> I think that dude was memeing
[0:34:35] <+Punchasaur> Or re2
[0:34:37] <%ainzhelm> You should have shot Conrad. Funny scene
[0:34:40] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 29 months of being entertained by some of my favorite chuckle fucks. keep on keeping on and stay crunchy, even in milk
[0:34:44] <totorno> how is Zangief? @patstaresat
[0:34:44] <DatAsuna> Party dialogue is super missable
[0:34:47] <$Futurecity10> yeah he was memeing
[0:34:52] <%ape_hawk> THANKA THA PEEPOS
[0:34:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat I took Legion to Talis loyalty mission AND romaced her b4 Endgame and lost no crew member
[0:34:53] <+robosqueeb> yeah but what about the dialogue you didnt hear
[0:34:54] <stantheman_97> some have more
[0:34:55] <%Varlinator> There's always going to be content you miss out on in ME2
[0:34:56] <DatAsuna> but nobody can see it all without huge savescumming
[0:34:56] <%Monkeyweed21> So how is Tales different?
[0:34:57] <%ape_hawk> oh
[0:34:59] <%RubberFistFight> @mikeriffic he knows that, but there's additional conditions as well as conditional modifiers that can increase that gap from 1 to 3 or more. It's super fucking complex.
[0:35:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Neat
[0:35:02] <T_Sasquatch> Make him panic
[0:35:03] <%BigCoffee> I know what you mean
[0:35:07] <%Treuan> Makes sense, it's like intended missing
[0:35:07] <%Rookie_Balboa> which is why Youtube exist. Just look up the missions youre curious about and see all crew members reactions
[0:35:08] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Halfway to having your sub baby Pat, unless it comes out 2 months early like I did
[0:35:10] <+robosqueeb> conditional goblins
[0:35:10] <DatAsuna> Roche is great
[0:35:11] <%BigCoffee> I have the same issue
[0:35:12] <$Ziegsy> @ape_hawk PEEPOS?! ziegsyNana
[0:35:13] <+kortin> that's be cause Iorveth sucks
[0:35:13] <%dekkitout> Goblins arent aware of permutations
[0:35:16] <%Monkeyweed21> The missable skits in Tales can be mutually exclusive @PatStaresAt
[0:35:17] <$RealThiele> if its all goblins, then no goblins
[0:35:18] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Pat did you somewhere say how you felt about the end of Yorha raid quests?
[0:35:19] <%dankjerri> your brain is fuck
[0:35:19] <%NateyBeak> its cuz you know you had no choice vs you had a chance
[0:35:22] <DatAsuna> Iorveth is a dick, but you never met best girl saskia without him
[0:35:23] <%tank7013> Makes total sense. There's a difference between a fail state and making a choice
[0:35:24] <%heartlesshealer> mutual exclusive is not fully in your control, so it's fair for goblins to not attach
[0:35:27] <+AgniBrandt> That choice was fucking great
[0:35:33] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Becuase it's not missable, it's just the consequences of your actions
[0:35:35] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Iorveth side is so much better.
[0:35:36] <+robosqueeb> thats not goblins, thats hobgoblins
[0:35:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Monkeyweed21 Because it's either/or, not just "Oh I missed it"
[0:35:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hmm. So it's a chosen path thing, not a blink-and-you'll-miss-it thing.
[0:35:42] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh cool
[0:35:42] <DatAsuna> Iorveth side is an entire different second act
[0:35:52] <DatAsuna> Wait Woolie outpaced you?
[0:35:52] <%dankjerri> now
[0:35:55] <%mikesapartment> well it sucks anyway
[0:35:59] <%Garthunox> Pat, stop listening to the randoms on twitter about stuff you might be interested in, they will always give conflicting info and you'll find something that wakes the goblins, Berseria is a genuinely great game, skits are just that, skits
[0:35:59] <$Solid_Stro> I played Pong 2 before playing the first Pong, I’m totally lost.
[0:36:02] <DatAsuna> Oh no those
[0:36:03] <%sunsetdisc0> @patstaresat which me2 recruitment/loyalty mission is your favorite
[0:36:06] <+swearinglotus> but just do it
[0:36:06] <+Punchasaur> Get a mod that replaces grunt with a 6 foot Noid
[0:36:09] <%rekinom> Don't worry Woolie already told us what happens Kappa
[0:36:10] <%BigCoffee> Dialogue I guess, for you, is a here and now kinda thing. And if you play it it just happens and that's kinda it. Versus things you can mechanically get and miss which is infuriating
[0:36:15] <%justcallmebobplease> RIGHT NOW
[0:36:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Man, all the alien characters in Mass Effect are so fucking awesome and sexy. Good for them.
[0:36:33] <$Futurecity10> I mean legit you cant get all skits on 1 playthrough
[0:36:33] <%heartlesshealer> could just do it then help guild for an hour
[0:36:36] <$SGrim> HERE FOR TALI TAIL
[0:36:37] <%dankjerri> they showed up to backseat
[0:36:37] <butthurtdave> Nah, I showed up here for the dog
[0:36:37] <eco419> It’s ok Pat
[0:36:37] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat did you do anything for Fête nationale?
[0:36:38] <%DracosMagala> IM NOT PokGengar
[0:36:38] <olaksi> i showed up for prestream
[0:36:38] <%Mr_pale> do it now
[0:36:41] <%StaceMcGate> I came here to watch Collector Ship
[0:36:41] <%Rookie_Balboa> I was watching a friend play through a Tales game that didnt have Voiced skits in english and he was just... ignoring the skits
[0:36:42] <DatAsuna> @Garthunox Except Tales games have more than just skits hidden behind backtracking at very weird times.
[0:36:43] <$RealThiele> sex the blussy
[0:36:43] <%Dakuu75> Meh, I show'd up for you @PatStaresAt , don't really care what you play
[0:36:44] <%Ranryu692> yeah, I would leave if you did FFXIV spoilers right now lol
[0:36:45] <+kortin> @Garthunox I think it's dishonest to present the skits as something that are ALWAYS skippable, though. There are some genuine character building moments in a lot of them.
[0:36:46] <$Ziegsy> Ive been playing scarlet nexus all day. I smacked a cow round the head with a dumptruck 10/10 game of the year
[0:36:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt some of the skits in Tales games are mutually exclusive you cant see them all in 1 playthrough
[0:36:48] <%MidnightBurst12> i need my hit of blussy
[0:36:58] <%Garthunox> @DatAsuna Then they're not worth it

[0:40:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Nah you'd be fine
[0:40:18] <Profmcstevie> I didn't finish KH1 and skipped COM cos didn't have the system, yet I mostly got KH2
[0:40:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GOOD STOP AT BBS
[0:40:22] <%dankjerri> juneteenth is the day the first slaves were emancipated in america
[0:40:25] <%Mattais88> I didn't even do BBS
[0:40:25] <%BigCoffee> Because back then no one fucking played every KH games because you needed 7 FUCKING CONSOLES
[0:40:26] <%weissguard> KH is definitely one where those goblins save you.
[0:40:26] <+swearinglotus> I started with 365/2 days and then 2
[0:40:26] <+ChaosEmralds> there wasnt anything in between 2 andBBS
[0:40:27] <+BigBlackBankai> Started eith 2
[0:40:27] <%heartlesshealer> which chain of memories, GBA or PS?
[0:40:28] <%Mrbaconator> KH3 is meh as fuck
[0:40:28] <%ItalianWaifu> thats fine its not good anyway
[0:40:29] <GustauveVIII> i havent played KH3 yet, but i always wondered why they didnt include the final fantasy characters
[0:40:29] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU NEED TO PLAY 3D FIRST AND LEARN ABOUT THE LETTER X

[0:40:34] <DatAsuna> When Woolie does ME2 I will probably do what I did for kotor 2 and just make a supercut of all the missed content to watch at the end.
[0:40:35] <brisk_dacat> they explain alot of kh plots in the journals
[0:40:35] <%lucaflowe> No
[0:40:36] <%spitelite> you would probably explode
[0:40:36] <+ImmaterialHero> Chain of Memories is fine, but Re:CoM sucked ass. It's fine to read it.

[0:42:05] <Jetsfantasy> Ps2, GBA, 3DS, PSP, 3DS, PS4
[0:42:07] <%bread_assassin> Having one entry on the DS and another on the PSP was real fuckin' dumb.
[0:42:08] <+JasonTheJazz> my first one was Chain of Memories
[0:42:08] <%Kitafin> I do know how bad that was
[0:42:10] <%dankjerri> ps2, gba, psp, browser game, DS, 3Ds, ps3, ps4
[0:42:11] <%bhp_99> I played the crap out of COM on the GBA
[0:42:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude if KH4 was Parking Lot KH I would buy it in a second.
[0:42:12] <%Mattais88> Ps2, GBA, PS2, Phone, Psp, Vita, PS4
[0:42:15] <$RealThiele> it sucked
[0:42:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> EVERY FUCKING CONSOLE HAD A KH GAME
[0:42:17] <marvel877> PS2, GBA, DS, PSP, PS4, CELL PHONE, WEB BROWSER
[0:42:17] <%Kitafin> I tried to play all of them
[0:42:18] <+JasonTheJazz> didnt understand shit of it
[0:42:18] <%ainzhelm> I’m glad I have no interest in kingdom hearts
[0:42:18] <%NateyBeak> ps2. GBA. ps2. nokia phone, ds, psp, phone, 3ds, ps4
[0:42:18] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:42:19] <butthurtdave> Speaking of Square games, any interest in the new TWEWY?
[0:42:21] <$Solid_Stro> It was bad and I spent money to keep up, I don’t think it was worth it c4sageLUL
[0:42:22] <+swearinglotus> yensid is Disney backwards thats all you need to know
[0:42:23] <%heartlesshealer> that's right the 3DS
[0:42:23] <%peachyprimrose> peachyprimrose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! This is part of the reason why I'm glad I never got into KH
[0:42:25] <%solracc25> It was mostly due to gimmics
[0:42:27] <DSD24> 358/2
[0:42:28] <knight_verse> Oh great, I leave for 30 minutes and not only is he still no playing the game but he is talking about Kingdom Hearts WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE AGAIN.
[0:42:29] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[0:42:29] <%cvp5127> then bby
[0:42:30] <%weissguard> The mobile game got a rerelease on the ds
[0:42:30] <+ChaosEmralds> CoM got remade on the PS2 as well.
[0:42:32] <mak0t0yukii> GBA, DS,Psp, 3ds
[0:42:35] <+even_the_yuenglings> god I cant stand HK LuL
[0:42:36] <%StaceMcGate> WHO WILL I EAT ICE CREAM WITH?
[0:42:37] <+ImmaterialHero> @PatStaresAt don't forget the JP only bonus releases that had extra shit for lore we didn't get
[0:42:40] <%NateyBeak> god i love this series :)
[0:42:40] <%AncelDeLambert> like, fucking christ
[0:42:40] <DatAsuna> I only played chain and birth by sleep lol
[0:42:41] <Jetsfantasy> rereleases don't count
[0:42:47] <%AncelDeLambert> we're not even halfway through the list
[0:42:50] <%lucaflowe> Coded came out on DS and is in the all in one collection as a movie
[0:42:51] <PanicSwytch> Re:Coded as well
[0:42:53] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat youre forgetting the web browser game
[0:42:54] <%baka_sugoi> 02 - 10 man
[0:43:00] <+CookieCutter007> wtf why is tv so bright
[0:43:01] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt Eh, it's really simple. The order is 1 -> CoM -> 358/2 -> 2 -> BBS -> re:CODED -> Dream Drop -> 2.8 Final Chapter -> 3 -> Melody of Memory (the rhythm game)
[0:43:01] <+Punchasaur> Birth by blussy
[0:43:06] <%Garthunox> and the 3DS one
[0:43:09] <knight_verse> People who complain about Kingdom Hearts are not as smart as they think they are.
[0:43:10] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:43:10] <%solracc25> mobile game is more of a tangent story
[0:43:17] <%lucaflowe> But does that even matter now when you can literally get all the games on PS4 for 30 bucks?
[0:43:18] <%StaceMcGate> now there are 2 browser games LUL
[0:43:20] <%Garthunox> @DorianCreed wrong order
[0:43:20] <%heartlesshealer> BROWSER
[0:43:21] <mak0t0yukii> Technically mobile
[0:43:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> WHAT THE FUCK IS "KEY"
[0:43:24] <butthurtdave> The worst is there's a big reference to the mobile game in 3
[0:43:26] <%NateyBeak> i cant WAIT for the Nomura written stageplay of verum rex
[0:43:27] <Blank9> what about the Kingdom Hearts cereal box decoder ring
[0:43:29] <$RealThiele> SIMPLE and CLEAN
[0:43:30] <bob900000> nope
[0:43:31] <+BurningWigEmissary> sqeenix be like," hey Sony watch this, no hands"
[0:43:31] <+JaseAdrift> The mobile game is still important to the stoty guys
[0:43:32] <HarshNerf> lore is lore there are no tangents
[0:43:36] <DSD24> Some type of Key Blade?
[0:43:37] <%DorianCreed> @DorianCreed What did I fuck up?
[0:43:39] <+SocialMisfitGamer> 2.8
[0:43:39] <%cvp5127> Recoded
[0:43:39] <%heartlesshealer> "key" as in X
[0:43:40] <%ItalianWaifu> @knight_verse what does that even mean?
[0:43:42] <%dankjerri> thats a tech demo
[0:43:42] <%NateyBeak> unchained, dark road
[0:43:43] <bob900000> union
[0:43:45] <$RealThiele> 365//2
[0:43:47] <+ChaosEmralds> those were compilation cames technically
[0:43:49] <%HairballCT> @ScrapKingKeita p sure it's the mobile game
[0:43:50] <DatAsuna> god fuck square enix naming conventions
[0:43:51] <Profmcstevie> union cross~
[0:43:52] <butthurtdave> Dont forget the rhythm game
[0:43:54] <%Nekros4442> KH3 has story relevant things that link from the mobile game fyi
[0:43:54] <BlueLunecy> You are startlingly on top of this
[0:43:54] <bob900000> 365
[0:43:55] <%BigCoffee> *key* is the greek symbol chi which looks like an X
[0:43:58] <PanicSwytch> UnionX
[0:44:00] <%solracc25> 0.2 before 3
[0:44:03] <%Garthunox> Dream Drop Distance
[0:44:04] <knight_verse> Multiple collection already exist where you can easily get all of the games, why are people still complaining?
[0:44:04] <%NateyBeak> oh yea dont forget memory of melody, its canon
[0:44:05] <+Punchasaur> Nomura needs to never write anything ever
[0:44:05] <%MidnightBurst12> nope
[0:44:07] <%cvp5127> rechained
[0:44:08] <%dankjerri> OH YEAJ THE RHYTHM GAME ON SWITCH
[0:44:08] <%JohnAtDawn> Did you even LIKE Kingdom Hearts?
[0:44:10] <%AncelDeLambert> you have to be a rich little shit to have followed along with the KH series as it released
[0:44:11] <DeadPixel_TV> worth playing all of them?
[0:44:11] <%heartlesshealer> Union Cross is mobile
[0:44:12] <%Dakuu75> the bundles
[0:44:12] <marvel877> @butthurtdave Big reference that isn't even in Union X
[0:44:14] <superchunk121> re coded is like the only one that is actually nothing and can skip
[0:44:17] <%NateyBeak> re-mind
[0:44:17] <%ExpressNode> I never had a PSP but owned all the other things it came out on
[0:44:18] <%ssjklyco> I want them to just release one on the Wii just to fuck with people
[0:44:22] <%RonaldMcDownload> Do JRPG developers do that on purpose?
[0:44:25] <%Daxalog> Daxalog subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Monthly Protection Money Sent.
[0:44:29] <%weissguard> Those were out a few years beforehand
[0:44:30] <+RedQueensAce> Nomura is out of control
[0:44:31] <%Garthunox> @dankjerri its on ps4 too
[0:44:33] <Psyramics> I have not owned a handheld since the game gear, I was very confused when I started KH2, and then you get control of Sora and it stopped mattering
[0:44:37] <%weissguard> And got rereleased on ps4
[0:44:37] <%heartlesshealer> coded
[0:44:38] <$RealThiele> just play KH3 ignore the rest LUL
[0:44:39] <Profmcstevie> Japan LOVES multimedia franchises, fucking NIER
[0:44:39] <+ChaosEmralds> coded was a movie too
[0:44:41] <%valriot> Kingdom Hearts is fucking stupid
[0:44:42] <Archmortal> the only subtitled game I've played is Chain of Memories and honestly, fuck literally all of the non-numbered ones, I got through 3 and understood the gist just fine
[0:44:42] <%solracc25> 3 has the lore books
[0:44:43] <shyrstyne> the compilation was the best thing to happen to kh as a series bc i *did* keep up with kh through all those systems (through borrowing from friends mostly) and it was *rough*
[0:44:50] <%JamesCorck> God, the KH games are a fucking mess!
[0:44:54] <%Rookie_Balboa> Kingdom Hearts takes the brunt of the world's punches because NIER's story was too niche before Automata
[0:44:54] <%Garthunox> Re:Coded was a movie too
[0:44:55] <%dankjerri> @garthunox but we need to list as many consoles as possible
[0:45:03] <knight_verse> @italianwaifu If you don't know then don't worry about it.
[0:45:04] <+Punchasaur> DONT PLAY ANY OF THEM
[0:45:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @ronaldmcdownload Nomura said he did every console he could so everyone could get a piece of the KH experience. dumb af
[0:45:06] <%spitelite> i've played every game you could play in the US and the series peaked at 2
[0:45:08] <srv4254> isnt 3 even worse than the rest
[0:45:11] <$RealThiele> gummi ships are also cancerous
[0:45:13] <butthurtdave> I'd say just watch a lore video, it's not worth it
[0:45:13] <+even_the_yuenglings> fuck that
[0:45:14] <Blank9> just watch clemps
[0:45:15] <+robosqueeb> kingdom hearts is fart poop garbage
[0:45:16] <%HairballCT> do 2 before Days, Days spoils the shit out of 2
[0:45:17] <%JohnAtDawn> 358 is just cutscenes in the compilations
[0:45:17] <marvel877> AND Melody of Memory came out .
[0:45:18] <%baka_sugoi> naw fuck that
[0:45:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> I want you for a lifetiiiiiime, so if you're gonna think twiiiiiiice, baby
[0:45:19] <Zalapski> do not do that
[0:45:19] <%JobbedBone> BibleThump don't do that to yourself
[0:45:20] <$thesickestzak> I’m still mad the eye on Riku’s keyblade is actually important to the story
[0:45:20] <tattleworm> how was your before crisis playthrough?
[0:45:21] <+megaman_sentinel> birth my sleep was okay
[0:45:21] <Luizabd> You don't have to play them though
[0:45:22] <%NateyBeak> @PatStaresAt no joke you also have to learn the lore of the mobile game for kh3
[0:45:22] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat you have to play CoM twice
[0:45:23] <$DocMadfox> I fucking know this feeling, I have the same mind goblins.
[0:45:23] <%JamesCorck> This is making my chest tight XD holyfuck.
[0:45:24] <Alzero83> DO it, Coward
[0:45:25] <%valriot> Also they suck
[0:45:25] <%SirGO0SE> or you could take the much better option and not
[0:45:25] <DatAsuna> Also most of those games are bad
[0:45:25] <%lucaflowe> Or just watch Clemps
[0:45:27] <$Ziegsy> I loved 3 ;;
[0:45:27] <$Futurecity10> Then play 3 because the KH story doesnt work
[0:45:28] <superchunk121> Watch clemps
[0:45:29] <%JamesCorck> What a fucking mess.
[0:45:29] <%JoshManVGH> And watch like 4 hours of cutscenes
[0:45:29] <+JaseAdrift> Just go talk to clemps
[0:45:30] <%ItalianWaifu> its really not worth it anymore
[0:45:32] <olaksi> quite the bar of entry for pure dissapointment
[0:45:32] <Laecerelius> Just watch the Barry videos
[0:45:32] <Psyramics> I just watch KZXcellent play them every year, whatever
[0:45:34] <%AncelDeLambert> enter KH fans screaming that you can't review 3 until you play them all
[0:45:35] <%lucaflowe> Three
[0:45:35] <+ChaosEmralds> coded is cutscenes too
[0:45:36] <%bassoontyphoon> Kingdom hearts is an infamous career ending game (no joke) avoid it at all costss
[0:45:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw you're gonna miss a bunch of dialogue in ME cuz you dont have the IOS app
[0:45:39] <+Theherowithin> PogChamp
[0:45:40] <%StaceMcGate> Clemps plays these JRPGS so you don't have too @PatStaresAt
[0:45:41] <%lucaflowe> Recoded is also just cutscenes
[0:45:41] <+kortin> wait isn't DDD cutscenes too
[0:45:41] <%Garthunox> its a mess
[0:45:41] <%XeroRaizer> wait the eye actually has importance?
[0:45:42] <DatAsuna> And then also play the DLC
[0:45:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fuck that shit, just watch Parking Lot KH
[0:45:42] <%weissguard> mobile game lore is hardly relevant to 3, frankly
[0:45:42] <bob900000> yup
[0:45:43] <%Dakuu75> doesn't matter if you play them or not. you STILL gonna need a youtube video to explain all that shit
[0:45:43] <%solracc25> you don't really need chain of memories, 365/2 is a movie
[0:45:46] <%michingmallecho> I only played Kingdom hearts 1,2,3 and I followed the story fine. psaSmug
[0:45:47] <%lucaflowe> 3 games pat
[0:45:48] <%PhantomMiG> Recode is also cutscences
[0:45:49] <+kortin> Or did they actually do the full game for once
[0:45:49] <mak0t0yukii> Re coded is cutscenes
[0:45:49] <%lucaflowe> two movies
[0:45:50] <PanicSwytch> Thats what I did with Yakuza. Im currently on Yakuza 5. Its possible Pat
[0:45:51] <butthurtdave> Looks like DARKNESS is expecting us
[0:45:52] <Alzero83> You forgot 2.8 Prologue @PatStaresAt
[0:45:53] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:45:55] <marvel877> Coded's also cutscenes
[0:45:55] <%BigCoffee> good thing kh3 fucking sucks ass, so I'm free of that garbage series
[0:45:56] <%greencapps> Days is also just cutseens
[0:45:57] <%lucaflowe> and a mobile game that doesn't matter
[0:45:57] <+even_the_yuenglings> THE PRIIIIZEE
[0:45:59] <%dankjerri> gotta play the riku story in CoM
[0:46:00] <+Pknesstorm> I wish they did a remake of Days, its got way better combat than BBS
[0:46:00] <hambeerpig> I think it'd be best to just play KH3 and ignore anything you don't understand.
[0:46:00] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Jacob? Who?
[0:46:01] <+JaseAdrift> Worth it
[0:46:01] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[0:46:02] <%NateyBeak> I love kingdom hearts, i will never recommend kingdom hearts to anyone
[0:46:04] <%Monkeyweed21> TALI DRUNK TEXTS YOU
[0:46:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Or you could play a good game instead
[0:46:05] <+CookieCutter007> I want to get off Nomura's wild ride
[0:46:05] <$RealThiele> muh family
[0:46:06] <+dakarplaugas> Who cares about Jacob
[0:46:06] <%solracc25> chain is also just cutscenes
[0:46:08] <%logoth_> Yeah lets find out more about JACOB
[0:46:09] <+Punchasaur> Spare yourself and just ignore the whole series
[0:46:10] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe people are right to worry about FF7Rs direction...
[0:46:12] <falyden> is it weird that I find Mordin hot?
[0:46:12] <$DocMadfox> It does NOT make Jacob more interesting either
[0:46:12] <%BigCoffee> The absolute second worst character in Mass effect
[0:46:13] <%greencapps> and the mobile game doesn't really matter for 3
[0:46:14] <%condemned_15> lol
[0:46:15] <%baka_sugoi> once i heard the GBA was lore and i didn't have a GBA at the time and DROPPED the series
[0:46:16] <wolfen091> @bassoontyphoon that lp was going on when our boys broke up
[0:46:17] <+robosqueeb> Jacobs not that bad
[0:46:18] <DatAsuna> I played that mobile game and he's just worse zaeed
[0:46:19] <$thesickestzak> @xeroraizer it has to do with the Master of Masters apparently
[0:46:19] <TapAtoLive> You're not even really missing anything, it's just extra combat barks and nothing else.
[0:46:20] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt I'm a huge KH fan, its a fuckin mess, and nothing makes me happier than dunking on the series
[0:46:21] <%bassoontyphoon> But the priiiiize
[0:46:23] <+kortin> +
[0:46:24] <%heartlesshealer> Mordin is hot, it's okay
[0:46:25] <%Monkeyweed21> NO ITS MORE THAN JACOB LIKE TALI AND JAVIK DIALOGUE
[0:46:37] <knight_verse> Neirs stoey is an even worse incomprehensible mess, yet that gets a pass because people think it's art
[0:46:41] <%ape_hawk> its a real shame that bioware never managed to make a good black companion in any of their games
[0:46:42] <Blank9> javik's cool
[0:46:43] <$RealThiele> aero ALL the things
[0:46:44] <$Ziegsy> where are the babies?
[0:46:48] <+even_the_yuenglings> oof
[0:46:48] <%bassoontyphoon> @wolfen091 yup! And it’s not the only channel that died lping KH
[0:46:54] <%JohnAtDawn> Wtf dude
[0:46:56] <%baka_sugoi> heard about that
[0:46:57] <RatloreTheIdiot> what the fuck
[0:46:59] <Archmortal> it's not fucking worth playing any of them unless you just wanna play 2FM for the sick combat
[0:46:59] <+rich_mon> this whole conversation is why i started watching letsplays. i aint got time for all that
[0:46:59] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt KH is like someone split up the Silmarillion across different titles
[0:47:03] <$RealThiele> drama stirring
[0:47:03] <+RedQueensAce> was that bait?
[0:47:03] <%za7az> I think there was a new one found
[0:47:04] <%afronooch> yeah...
[0:47:04] <butthurtdave> Speaking of Square games, any interest in the new TWEWY game?

[0:50:00] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It hurts my face
[0:50:01] <%Shubreaker> cruelty squad is cool but it literally visually assaults you
[0:50:07] <Profmcstevie> Jaffe dunked on it, so people who would like it hear about it and his plan fails
[0:50:08] <%heartlesshealer> is it real?
[0:50:11] <%BigCoffee> It is literally trash made with care

[0:50:23] <Manwad> there's so much care
[0:50:27] <%StaceMcGate> “Cruelty Squad feels like a dangerous .exe that came secretly attached to a free trial of sketchy antivirus software circa 2002.”

[0:54:28] <BigYanno> Xehanort was lying to them, that's all it was

[0:54:44] <%Robot_Nixon_> Kingdom Hearts sucks and is badly written, but play it onstream atpRtsd
[0:54:44] <shadoke> You grab Nomura by his many belts and zippers, and you tell him what's what

[0:54:44] <%SkyfireHero> they start as blank slates but become regular people again

[0:55:06] <chan_chan_revolution> So the very concept of being a Nobody is stupid
[0:55:07] <olaksi> yep
[0:55:08] <+MisdirectionErection> yes
[0:55:09] <butthurtdave> It is a Nomura game, so yeah
[0:55:10] <Profmcstevie> "I lied" is his reason, legitimately

[0:55:13] <Zeif00> Yes
[0:55:13] <knight_verse> If you want to know then play the game and stop reading wikis
[0:55:16] <%ape_hawk> im norting so much right now
[0:55:16] <%StaceMcGate> @ShawnTK_ Its Nomura backtracking on his presentation of characters and trying to explain how they had emotions.
[0:55:16] <+Daigrey> why is this man so angry?
[0:55:16] <Archmortal> I don't wanna spoil shit but like... the Nobodies and emotions are not even CLOSE to as stupid as KH gets
[0:55:19] <+DatFooGamma> *Goofy voice* Wake me up inside
[0:55:19] <%BigCoffee> chocobos soulda been in Kh
[0:55:20] <$DocMadfox> That is literally the explanation, they are too stupid to know they have emotions
[0:55:21] <+sutchman> it's okay, Pat, the dumb kingdom hearts bullshit can't hurt you
[0:55:22] <+MadPretty> Kingdom Hearts SUcks
[0:55:22] <%za7az> THEY ARE REALLY STUPID
[0:55:24] <critiquequartz> They’re babies pat
[0:55:25] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @patstaresat did you hear Bout how the dream eaters came to be??
[0:55:26] <shyrstyne> the nobodies start regrowing hearts basically the instant they lose them. they were hardcore gaslit into beleiving otherwise
[0:55:26] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:55:26] <%Alopekis> Oh cool. I broke the little thing that lets my keyboard sit up somehow.
[0:55:27] <%KaiserMario> So Mas Effect, huh? LUL
[0:55:27] <TourettesPlays> There is such a thing as being too stupid to feel fear, like that russian guy who kicked a bear
[0:55:27] <$Solid_Stro> Ask Nomura, Pat
[0:55:28] <EskimoSpy31> If he died, who'd he eat ice cream with
[0:55:29] <%logoth_> Let's us discuss it
[0:55:29] <%ironohki> @Daigrey The world may never know.
[0:55:30] <+BigBlackBankai> No, but they retconned a retcon tho
[0:55:32] <%solracc25> Pat, edgelord kids audience
[0:55:32] <%psidefx> Yes upon creation you get told your feelings aren't a thing
[0:55:33] <%dankjerri> upsetti orb
[0:55:33] <%StrawberryPantsu> CHAOS!
[0:55:34] <%ape_hawk> Let's Us Discuss This
[0:55:34] <bob900000> "why is this man so angry"
[0:55:35] <%valriot> LET'S US DISCUSS
[0:55:37] <+cascadepersona> Kingdom Hearts is pretty cool
[0:55:37] <%SkyfireHero> their boss was an asshole and lied to them
[0:55:40] <%ironohki> Pat's name literally used to be "Angriest Pat."
[0:55:40] <butthurtdave> Pat Stares At CHAOS is my favorite internet content creator
[0:55:40] <%saiyanblitz> Let me explain to you Dream Eaters and how they make no sense
[0:55:42] <NireFuster> Honestly everytime I think about the kingdom hearts plot I get super angry too at how stupid it is
[0:55:42] <olaksi> we aren't saying it changes that
[0:55:43] <%truexst0rm> MY EMOTIONS WERE AN ILLUSION TO MAKE YOU THINK I HAD A HEART ALL ALONG
[0:55:45] <s1rcuit> what do you think about people irl who think that about themselves?
[0:55:46] <thelonechris> Then that would make them gullible as fuck
[0:55:47] <Basch71> oh sure
[0:55:47] <%dankjerri> gaslit into emotionless husks
[0:55:47] <marvel877> Kingdom Hearts is dumb, I love it.
[0:55:53] <%BigCoffee> KH is a stupid game for emotional babies but it also plays like a dream and feels fantastic to control
[0:55:53] <%Dakuu75> Angry Pat, is scaring me. Can we bring back fun, staresatpat?
[0:55:53] <+dakarplaugas> BECAUSE THE CHILDREN PAT
[0:55:55] <BigYanno> Well Roxas questioned it. But then he died
[0:55:57] <%StaceMcGate> DreamDrop Distance ruined the series...further
[0:55:57] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's stupid, but there is also no defending it
[0:55:57] <critiquequartz> They are actual babies
[0:55:57] <AXL808> stupidity is not an emotion, they CAN be stupid
[0:55:57] <+superchronicc> theyalso said they pretend to have emotions
[0:55:57] <MsYakumo> Imagine waking up with no memories and being told over and over that your emotions aren't actually real.
[0:55:59] <%Shubreaker> NEXT BIT
[0:55:59] <Zeif00> Yes
[0:55:59] <+JaseAdrift> Kingdom hearts has cool moments but its also not cool
[0:56:00] <%psidefx> But they don't understand what emotions actually are (headcannon)
[0:56:00] <$RealThiele> Sora gotta get the Keyblade to fight the Xi blade for the keyblade wielders xi
[0:56:00] <bob900000> retcon
[0:56:00] <%heartlesshealer> they're kinda born fully grown, so they ARE stupid
[0:56:02] <+vaderxyz1970> @saiyanblitz do it
[0:56:03] <%ape_hawk> do you think Xemnas crunched Org 13?
[0:56:04] <%weissguard> They kinda don't ever look like they really believe it tho. I get the frustration tho.
[0:56:04] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt they start with no heart, but grow a heart. it's dumb.
[0:56:05] <+DatFooGamma> Pat are you a HEARTLESS?
[0:56:05] <jackedup92> emotions are only chemicals tho
[0:56:05] <$Solid_Stro> The dumbest of explanations c4sageLUL
[0:56:07] <%Alopekis> Cry
[0:56:08] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Cry?
[0:56:08] <%joodatious> why is this man so angry?
[0:56:09] <marvel877> "BUT THEN THE MUSIC GETS SAD!"
[0:56:09] <%spitelite> nomura is kind of a hack when it comes to story telling
[0:56:12] <%baka_sugoi> not the NOSE
[0:56:13] <thelonechris> You take THEIR nose?
[0:56:14] <%ironohki> "Each t-shirt you buy helps Pat grow in size AND anger!"
[0:56:14] <%Monkeyweed21> The emotions take a year or two to regrow, until then they are legit emotionless @PatStaresAt
[0:56:16] <xanerts> wow pat is so smart
[0:56:17] <%psidefx> THE NOSE IS REAL EMOTIONS ARE CONCEPTS
[0:56:18] <trianglehat> 5Head
[0:56:19] <Profmcstevie> Why would someone believe a lie in front of overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Hmmm???
[0:56:21] <+CookieCutter007> I cry FeelsBadMan
[0:56:23] <%templar010> Patrick most children are stupid
[0:56:24] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[0:56:24] <BigYanno> Have you even played Kingdom Hearts?
[0:56:25] <%valriot> Well yeah, youre like 34
[0:56:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:56:26] <%mikeriffic> Pat why are you so emotional about this?
[0:56:28] <+robosqueeb> talking about kingdom hearts is all the fun of having diarrhea without shitting everywhere
[0:56:28] <%za7az> Genius Patumbo
[0:56:28] <%BigCoffee> @spitelite yeah but don't tell the ff7r people
[0:56:31] <balthazar758> an be like "wut"
[0:56:32] <Archmortal> I CAN LITERALLY STILL SEE MY NOSE ON MY FACE
[0:56:32] <xanerts> weird flex but ok
[0:56:34] <marvel877> Pat, you can't smell, so you don't have a nose.
[0:56:34] <+Punchasaur> LOOK UP THE WORD EMOTIONS IN A DICTIONARY
[0:56:35] <$Solid_Stro> Noses are a concept, Pat
[0:56:35] <+vaderxyz1970> WTF is even the Kingdom Hearts
[0:56:36] <%heartlesshealer> Born fully grown body
[0:56:36] <%Rookie_Balboa> can YOU prove YOU have emotions?
[0:56:37] <HarshNerf> BibleThump they took this man's nose
[0:56:38] <%DorianCreed> Pat, you have to remember: it's not the characters that are stupid, it's Kingdom Hearts as a series
[0:56:40] <%valriot> 5 Kappa
[0:56:40] <satans_finest_millennial> id say " then how are my glasses still on?"
[0:56:42] <Daniel_Is_I> 5 is too old for that
[0:56:46] <%Dakuu75> @Bigyanno he's played 1 and 2 at least
[0:56:47] <%psidefx> same
[0:56:48] <$Ziegsy> they are told they remember what the emotions felt like.
[0:56:49] <%kortin> @Profmcstevie Yeah, this, basically
[0:56:50] <%jaggstar2020> Good evening buttmunchers
[0:56:52] <+EmptyMug> Baby Pat was no nonsense
[0:56:55] <$RealThiele> would it still fool paige?
[0:56:55] <Zeif00> hold EVERYTHING
[0:56:56] <%Monkeyweed21> The emotions take a while to come back, like a year
[0:56:57] <T_Sasquatch> Your dark nose, give it to me
[0:56:58] <+robosqueeb> they say if your hand is bigger than your face youre at risk for diseased pat
[0:56:58] <%NopeBadguy> pat dunks on five year olds too stupid to learn that their nose cannot be taken
[0:57:01] <%Varlinator> "Here comes the airplane" IT'S A FUCKING SPOON MOM!
[0:57:10] <SilverFaustX> redneck rave
[0:57:12] <%heartlesshealer> oh no kentucky

[0:57:27] <Profmcstevie> .....now that's a party
[0:57:27] <%JoshManVGH> Nobodies are created when a heart falls to darkness and becomes a heartless. The nobody is the body that gets left behind. The No Body is a Body... left behind. And they also have their own heart pieces cause fuck it.
[0:57:28] <%StrawberryPantsu> Kentucky is hidden florida

[1:02:17] <nyacoo> destroy the blockchain
[1:02:18] <Dunmarkh> There's a bitcoin atm outside of a liquor store in my town and I hope someone lights it on fire
[1:02:19] <%Monkeyweed21> bitcoin and covid took all the microchips

[1:02:30] <$DocMadfox> @Alopekis I intentionally oversimplified it.
[1:02:31] <%MistyMntns> Lack of resources for superconductors to make PCs
[1:02:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> its not all bitcoin, Electric vehicle market too
[1:02:33] <balthazar758> coin
[1:02:38] <%heartlesshealer> hate rich people toys
[1:02:46] <HarshNerf> capitalism unironically is managing to destroy gaming ResidentSleeper
[1:02:46] <+dakarplaugas> Yea
[1:02:58] <+dakarplaugas> God I hate the fucking ending
[1:03:02] <%Rookie_Balboa> its OKAY
[1:03:11] <Latija> must have got the green ending
[1:03:11] <$RealThiele> its star control!
[1:03:11] <Rao2357> EVs are, like, a real product though, unlike crypto.
[1:03:12] <+dakarplaugas> IT IS NOT OKAY
[1:03:15] <%StaceMcGate> Its a cop-out ending
[1:03:23] <thelonechris> What
[1:03:28] <%baka_sugoi> FISH
[1:03:30] <DatAsuna> I can't imagine any video game or tv show .etc bothering me that much
[1:03:32] <%ironohki> This is accurate to the fanbase of this channel.
[1:03:34] <%SirGO0SE> yes be mad at bitcoin and sell it to me :)
[1:03:36] <%dekkitout> "I have peanut allergy" "But try this peanut brittle tho"
[1:03:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> graphics cards need the chipset, chipset comes from TSM and takes GALLONS of water to make. Taiwan is also in a drought. EV market is hustling cards as well
[1:03:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> But Pat, it's a Swedish fish
[1:03:40] <%Varlinator> The ending's fine. Get over it.
[1:03:43] <%heartlesshealer> Unless Pineapple allergy
[1:03:45] <%Rookie_Balboa> The ending didnt ruin the series for me like it did for many others
[1:03:48] <%dankjerri> at least 8 hours, close to 80 sometimes of trying
[1:03:49] <MsVcol> Congrats on owning Jaffe so hard he yelled about it for two and a half hours
[1:03:49] <%ironohki> I don't like when Pat doesn't like what I like, but I let it go because IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[1:03:51] <$RealThiele> "pop it in your mouth and try it"
[1:03:53] <%StaceMcGate> reminder that before DLC, the game just ended after the color. No text, no what happen afterwards, just over.
[1:03:57] <DatAsuna> Some games are simply LP poison
[1:03:59] <%Rookie_Balboa> The ending up until the choices was phenominal anyways
[1:04:00] <%Dakuu75> yep
[1:04:00] <ToneBacas> i feel ya
[1:04:01] <Profmcstevie> "just stop caring" can't dummy

[1:04:16] <+m3chamike> Mass Effect 1 gave me OCD
[1:04:16] <DatAsuna> God fuck bethesda games and their misc quest logs
[1:04:19] <%Ranryu692> You're gonna hate the beginning of ME3 then
[1:04:20] <%Monkeyweed21> but you miss tons of content in games like Yakuza 7
[1:04:25] <thelonechris> My New Vegas log is always occupied by those DLC quests
[1:04:26] <%StaceMcGate> StaceMcGate is continuing the Gift Sub they got from DreamingRabbit_! 
[1:04:27] <DatAsuna> Like you CAN'T NOT pick those quests up
[1:04:29] <marvel877> You can't turn off the Mind Goblins
[1:04:29] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS time gated quests
[1:04:31] <%MostFrank> "Don't be you, be me."
[1:04:32] <butthurtdave> Is there a mod to stop the kidnapping from happening?
[1:04:32] <DatAsuna> but they never stop
[1:04:34] <$RealThiele> plan has been made
[1:04:35] <Latija> watching these streams is like having a terminal diagnosis with me3 on the horizon
[1:04:35] <%AzureGale> Touhou hijack lol
[1:04:38] <DatAsuna> and you can't abandon them
[1:04:38] <+Punchasaur> One guy likes the ending. I’m sure he likes Picard too
[1:04:42] <+superchronicc> pat likes structure
[1:04:44] <+Kaiserzelcor> Btw I'm the guy who argued with you about Trails on Twitter. FWIW I'm with you about missable content that's why I abuse the ever living fuck out of optional content guides
[1:04:44] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed the entire romance sidequests in Yakuza 7 and that didnt bother you
[1:04:46] <%dankjerri> oh did they fix it?
[1:04:47] <%WutangchickeN> is this stream start or end???
[1:04:51] <+dakarplaugas> It did not ruin the whole series but it was a shit ending that ruined a lot of the good feels I had...kind of like the Game of Thrones ending
[1:04:58] <%Alopekis> @WutangchickeN Both
[1:05:02] <%DorianCreed> @dankjerri It's still bad, but it used to be a lot worse
[1:05:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> that's what she said
[1:05:03] <%StaceMcGate> @Punchasaur Picard S2 Baybee
[1:05:05] <$touhou_hijack> well dodged a bullet there then I guess
[1:05:08] <%blutzwavedave> blutzwavedave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 Months! Feels like it should be longer. I'm glad to have been able to catch more livestreams and excited for the rest of Mass Effect. Thanks for everything Pat, Paige, and Babies. PS, if I wanted to get the Pat Eyeball as a tattoo, would that be okay?
[1:05:10] <%WutangchickeN> @alopekis OH GOD
[1:05:16] <cosmicdischarge> Fake OSD
[1:05:17] <%baka_sugoi> eh
[1:05:17] <gerryxes109> Ending is not great, but I'll always wonder what the reaction would've been if you couldn't choose at all. If you instead got a predetermined ending based on your choices
[1:05:20] <+ScrapKingKeita> ICHIBAN FUCKS
[1:05:21] <%dankjerri> its yakuza. why does romance matter
[1:05:25] <%Daxalog> Game Feels Complete without it
[1:05:26] <+robosqueeb> but not those ones
[1:05:27] <%twistedj3ster> screw Yakuza's Go sidequests
[1:05:27] <%StaceMcGate> Its just some cutscenes, you don't actually choose a girl to romance
[1:05:27] <Laecerelius> The romance sidequest was pretty good.
[1:05:28] <Latija> pat has all the romance he needs
[1:05:31] <butthurtdave> I almost missed it because getting it to trigger took two hours
[1:05:32] <$RealThiele> Ichi doesnt need romance
[1:05:33] <%ssjklyco> Yakuza is a smaller scale compared to a full ass RPG
[1:05:35] <%psidefx> 7 games worth of them
[1:05:35] <+Punchasaur> @stacemcgate NotLikeThis
[1:05:36] <%heartlesshealer> sidequest saturation
[1:05:37] <$Futurecity10> yeah and you never fought amon in 6
[1:05:39] <%BigCoffee> Don't you hate romance stuff ?
[1:05:40] <satans_finest_millennial> @Monkeyweed21 he has realz luv. he no need beep boop lub dub
[1:05:43] <%Alopekis> @WutangchickeN Schrödinger's stream
[1:05:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Is romance even real in Yakuza?
[1:05:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> @dakarplaugas at least ME didn't butcher entire character arcs like GOT did
[1:05:53] <DatAsuna> @gerryxes109 would have been my preference, that said renegade control is the most hilariously disonant thing ever
[1:05:53] <xanerts> thats not really missing you can always come back to it though
[1:06:01] <%Monkeyweed21> so just stream JRPGs 4head
[1:06:06] <peyodogo> also by the end of y7 it's impossible to not be fucked up and burnt out
[1:06:10] <Cybersoul666> But Pat isnt that a double standard? If you played alot of tales games going by this logic wouldnt you be fine with missing some of the skits?
[1:06:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mood
[1:06:21] <peyodogo> it's such a long intense game
[1:06:21] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:06:22] <%bread_assassin> That sounds awful @PatStaresAt
[1:06:23] <%baka_sugoi> mood
[1:06:36] <$RealThiele> my favorite jprg method
[1:06:38] <%StaceMcGate> but Tales/trails games aren't fun Kappa
[1:06:41] <marvel877> That's sounds like something Woolie would do.
[1:06:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> why is everyone arguing with your mind goblins and blaming you lol
[1:06:45] <butthurtdave> Hyperfixation is some bullshit
[1:06:47] <%ainzhelm> Biggest problem with the ME3 ending isn’t that it ruined 3 or what came before. It’s that it dug the series into a hole for the future. And then andromeda pissed away the only good reason to continue
[1:06:49] <DatAsuna> @Cybersoul666 Well also tales games let you view all skits from a viewer in the endgame, including missed ones
[1:06:55] <Hairy_butts> very relatable
[1:07:05] <%joodatious> unlike tales yakuza a great game
[1:07:06] <%dankjerri> opposite of,me,I hate sidequests
[1:07:07] <Tracazoid> So your playthrough of Three Houses, or lack of finishing Three Houses
[1:07:09] <%MoguManda> wow I feel this really hard
[1:07:10] <+Smokebanshee> Do FFXIV's side quests bug you?
[1:07:11] <%Alopekis> Funny enough, Mass Effect is the only game I've played where I DON'T end up getting burned out by trying to do every piece of content.
[1:07:13] <%afronooch> ????
[1:07:14] <+superchronicc> its like self-imposed crunch time right? @PatStaresAt
[1:07:15] <PanicSwytch> LUL
[1:07:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> ew
[1:07:16] <%RetroCop87> I can't wait until the future study where they find that people that hoard potions and do all sidequests actually have a diagnosable mental illness
[1:07:16] <%afronooch> oh
[1:07:16] <SaltyAzteca> Wow Pat is still thanking the peepo
[1:07:16] <+robosqueeb> mature

[1:07:34] <+m3chamike> I never completed Fire Emblem 3 houses because my OCD forces me to try to level up everyone and I ruin the fun of the game for myself.

[1:12:54] <+robosqueeb> a girl would have to be broken to be into me
[1:12:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Was there a downside to being a nobody other than EMO
[1:12:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt none of that matters cuz the next KH is straight up gonna be Versus XIII
[1:12:56] <$RealThiele> ahhhh.... yes.

[1:13:17] <balthazar758> some ducktape and ready to go
[1:13:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> CappuccinoGuil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hi Pat, hope you, Paige, Elmo and Gief are doing. After an ABSOLUTE SHIT 2 years, I finally got a job that pays me well enough to comfortably resub. Sorry to hear about the goblins today, hope I didn't worsen it too much by talking about Tales of Berseria
[1:13:18] <olaksi> KH storyline feels like it's made for people who don't realize complicated can still be stupid
[1:13:23] <%afronooch> itd be a good tat
[1:13:28] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[1:13:33] <%StaceMcGate> @vaderxyz1970 being a nobody is basically being immortal. If your nobody and heartless are destroyed, you go back to being a complete person
[1:13:39] <%DEETRz> no coward keep the words on
[1:13:40] <+Romuken> An hour? Shit I just hopped in, what did I miss?

[1:13:47] <%baka_sugoi> EYE BALL

[1:13:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> SveriSageAdvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! the discussion about having to use multiple discs to install games back in the day reminded me of when i was installing Harry Potter: Sorcerer's Stone and it blue screened on the third disc and the computer died forever. RIP.
[1:13:54] <%MidnightBurst12> major cringe
[1:13:54] <$RealThiele> EXTRA LARGE FONT
[1:13:56] <%joodatious> tattoo pats face on your back like steeve o
[1:13:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just eyeball would be good.
[1:13:58] <wolfen091> all the way, in it to win it
[1:13:58] <%NopeBadguy> there's nothing more based than being true to your cringe
[1:13:58] <Profmcstevie> Just slap a fucking pepsi symbol on your chest while you're at it dude
[1:14:00] <%twistedj3ster> Pat could change brand at some point down the road...
[1:14:00] <%valriot> You can always pretend its the Neversoft logo is Pat does something spciy
[1:14:01] <%Shubreaker> bro how are we still talking about KH in chat move on lol
[1:14:01] <stantheman_97> be cringe
[1:14:01] <PanicSwytch> GO FULL LOGO
[1:14:01] <+CookieCutter007> two eyes on butt
[1:14:02] <butthurtdave> I wish you had told me that before I got this Peach Saliva tat
[1:14:03] <%Monkeyweed21> I can't believve KH got turned into Versus XIII
[1:14:03] <DatAsuna> BRAND yourself with brands
[1:14:04] <+RedQueensAce> atpCap
[1:14:04] <+PenmanLupine> Pat's own Turok baby
[1:14:06] <Dragovus> Don't get it in the middle of your forehead
[1:14:06] <%toolofparanoia> Cringe
[1:14:07] <%heartlesshealer> also may be bad PR if you become murder
[1:14:07] <%derpy_platypus> Big letters PATRICK BOIVIN
[1:14:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Tattoo toilet Pat
[1:14:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> aw shit i forgot to meant on the podcast, discussion on the podcast
[1:14:09] <%DEETRz> times new roman the font for maximum effect
[1:14:10] <%JobbedBone> I hate shirts that look like an advertisement.
[1:14:10] <gerryxes109> Get the entire stream layout as a back tat
[1:14:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> Put the logo with the name on your lower back Kappa
[1:14:13] <HarshNerf> he already has 2 eyeballs
[1:14:13] <+PenmanLupine> Pat's own walking Shadowman Grave
[1:14:16] <niffinbox> dont forget the tm
[1:14:22] <$RealThiele> pat having a shadowman baby soon LUL
[1:14:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS REALLY GOOD
[1:14:24] <+wmeldrum> tattoo? what if you hate pat the next month for his statements about THOSE PEOPLE
[1:14:29] <ingman112> “You looked into the jaws of capitalism and said yes daddy please”
[1:14:30] <%TacoSaIad> Pat will give you a lifetime sub if you name your baby Turok.
[1:14:32] <%Dakuu75> @gerryxes109 you joke. But, I bet you someone has done this.
[1:14:34] <%Larry_Q> third eye on the forhead for sure
[1:14:35] <%ra_ra_ra_randomhero> @patstaresat I'm at work and havemt been able to pay attention to your whole stream, so sorry if this was discussed, but can I get a summary of this David Scott Jaffe thing?
[1:14:37] <%AzureGale> oof
[1:14:45] <+vaderxyz1970> Ultakill stream with Giani?
[1:14:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You can always lower the difficulty Kappa
[1:14:54] <+Punchasaur> But Pat it’s a lifetime of advertisement
[1:14:57] <%Alopekis> Cause
[1:15:02] <%ssjklyco> It's like a fighting game
[1:15:02] <+zaitje> why not?
[1:15:04] <$Futurecity10> Because Zestria sucked ass
[1:15:04] <dan_g_v> because it's a game for NOT scrubs
[1:15:06] <%AzureGale> Combos are rad
[1:15:06] <%valriot> Berserl
[1:15:08] <General_Terro> cuz youll need them all
[1:15:08] <DatAsuna> Berseria is actually too simplified for my taste
[1:15:10] <+Romuken> Yo Pat, don't know about your streamer base wanting to watch it, but would you consider trying out space haven sometime?
[1:15:10] <%justcallmebobplease> I think it's because they iterated on NG+ Grade shop stuff over many games.
[1:15:11] <+Kaiserzelcor> Wait you played Berseria too? I missed this part
[1:15:11] <%heartlesshealer> Because Godhand had to happen FIRST
[1:15:12] <%StaceMcGate> You just spam elemental weaknesses Pat @PatStaresAt
[1:15:14] <Psyramics> to hit enemy weaknesses, of course
[1:15:14] <%kewlmyc> People loved Graces combat system, so they copied it
[1:15:16] <artoflec> its crazy yeah
[1:15:21] <%justcallmebobplease> It's sorta like MonHun and submenus and damage values
[1:15:21] <dan_g_v> gotta keep an endless combo
[1:15:22] <penitentpendant> Also some combos in Berseria have built in combos you can extend within itself
[1:15:22] <DatAsuna> Vesperia let you option select from 16 at once
[1:15:26] <%Alopekis> I own Berseria and still haven't played it, so I don't know.
[1:15:32] <$RealThiele> @ra_ra_ra_randomhero crunch bad, cliffy B crunch. david defend crunch. patt call out BS. jaffe annoying. pat stomp verbally on twitter
[1:15:32] <%StaceMcGate> the option of choice
[1:15:33] <%AzureGale> Because combos are rad
[1:15:34] <Psyramics> cause there's monster type weaknesses too
[1:15:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> You don't start with all those. You unlock Artes over time.
[1:15:34] <%cvp5127> pat should try ryza LUL
[1:15:34] <%Rookie_Balboa> for losers who want to try hard
[1:15:35] <%Mattais88> becasue you start with only four moves
[1:15:35] <Profmcstevie> It's a lot of juice but if you get over the hump you'll groove with it
[1:15:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man, I wish we could get a Valkyrie Profile game directed by Yoko Taro. Feels like the perfect director for that series
[1:15:37] <%valriot> Do combo, be Lady Guts
[1:15:39] <%kewlmyc> To target EVERY elemental weakness
[1:15:39] <%heartlesshealer> THERE'S ALSO MONSTER TYPE WEAKNESSES
[1:15:39] <%Dakuu75> Galaxy-Brain shit doodBigBrain
[1:15:39] <critiquequartz> Go watch tales of vesperia videos they’ve dialed down the combat
[1:15:42] <%ssjklyco> It's for the crazies
[1:15:42] <%Master_Van> Which character do you control?
[1:15:43] <+Romuken> Yo PSO2NG is sicc
[1:15:43] <Laecerelius> It's dumb. I far prefer the old way where you just make your combos out of moves instead of having to fucking premake combos. Feels terrible.
[1:15:44] <%Monkeyweed21> It evens out as you go
[1:15:44] <DatAsuna> Berseria is more automated
[1:15:45] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> is it more or less complicated than xenoblade chronicles 2, because i auto battled that whole game
[1:15:48] <%Garthunox> its more simple than it looks
[1:15:48] <artoflec> some moves target ENEMY TYPE weaknesses as well
[1:15:53] <%heartlesshealer> okay
[1:15:54] <%Mattais88> For fun
[1:16:01] <%Monkeyweed21> WATCH DONGURI's BERSERIA VIDEOS @PatStaresAt
[1:16:03] <peachy996> I miss any game?
[1:16:03] <critiquequartz> Yes
[1:16:07] <$Futurecity10> Yes
[1:16:08] <critiquequartz> Yeah
[1:16:09] <%Alopekis> But combos are cool
[1:16:10] <$Futurecity10> That is correct
[1:16:12] <%RetroCop87> Xilia has a tag-team combat system
[1:16:12] <%StaceMcGate> that's correct
[1:16:12] <%baka_sugoi> yeeah
[1:16:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> Right
[1:16:14] <%ape_hawk> is your combo your butt? hehe
[1:16:14] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt ok
[1:16:15] <%justcallmebobplease> That's Tales, yes.
[1:16:15] <$Futurecity10> Yeap
[1:16:16] <%valriot> Impulse Drive
[1:16:16] <%BigCoffee> yes bad game design
[1:16:16] <%pokefan9956> >game design
[1:16:20] <%AzureGale> But combos are rad
[1:16:20] <+AgniBrandt> You can literally make a combo that becomes the only one you ever need
[1:16:22] <%ainzhelm> Lady Guts
[1:16:22] <critiquequartz> It’s like that sometimes
[1:16:23] <$RealThiele> weakness means weak
[1:16:23] <Laecerelius> Vesperia's great. I love the Fatal Strike system.
[1:16:23] <+m3chamike> combos are cool
[1:16:24] <%kewlmyc> So you can be stylish
[1:16:24] <$Futurecity10> The more you use it, the better it becomes
[1:16:24] <%NopeBadguy> bad game design
[1:16:24] <%weissguard> You should ask Strident. pretty sure he's beaten it
[1:16:25] <%ssjklyco> So it's a fighting game
[1:16:25] <Basch71> you'll eventually loop combos infinitely and just shred everyone
[1:16:25] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt bad design
[1:16:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Every berseria question is a joke, like the game Kappa jk
[1:16:27] <penitentpendant> 'Heavy' moves cost more stamina. So if you have that as a 'combo' you're out of stamina and get smacked since you can't dodge now
[1:16:29] <%baka_sugoi> cool combos honestly
[1:16:30] <+AgniBrandt> That's the whole reason I fell off it
[1:16:30] <%Master_Van> They didnt think too deep
[1:16:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Why do so many games have unnecessary mechanics?
[1:16:32] <%Rookie_Balboa> Tales games have a complex combat system for nerds who want to try hard
[1:16:32] <%JobbedBone> Debadge your car if you care what it looks like. It looks so much better than advertising for a product you settled on anyways.
[1:16:34] <%joodatious> Berseria is the kind of game chat begs pat to play but doesn't watch the stream
[1:16:34] <Cybersoul666> Some moves get stronger depending if you use a certian move first
[1:16:35] <%ExpressNode> Well you hit the weakness then you build upon it increasing damage with other attacks
[1:16:35] <%Alopekis> Amazing design
[1:16:35] <artoflec> because some enemies will resist or fuck you up
[1:16:36] <%heartlesshealer> You get/lose GRADE depending on what you do in battle too. Like Stale moves
[1:16:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> You get better combos later
[1:16:37] <%Garthunox> yup
[1:16:37] <critiquequartz> Combos give grade
[1:16:39] <+m3chamike> In DMC you could just spam Lunar Wheel
[1:16:39] <%valriot> Just look at her fat booba idk
[1:16:40] <%Garthunox> thats right
[1:16:40] <+vaderxyz1970> No think only spam
[1:16:42] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt you mean like PSO@ NG with spell combat?
[1:16:42] <Daebunz> correct
[1:16:42] <%Robot_Nixon_> why use many word when few word do trick
[1:16:43] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt trash mobs are just easily killed by anything, and before long it just gives you 4+ fire moves to combo
[1:16:47] <%StoopKid241> You can map multiple different skills to the same button, so you can still spam.
[1:16:47] <niffinbox> for critics to be able to pass the first level
[1:16:48] <%StaceMcGate> I've beaten Beseria twice on the hardest difficulty, it's not worth trying to style hard
[1:16:49] <%madkingezra> style points
[1:16:50] <%RetroCop87> JP rpg nerds hate complexity
[1:16:50] <%Alopekis> I want MORE mechanics
[1:16:50] <Cybersoul666> Not to mention Bg costs amoung other mechics
[1:16:51] <%Monkeyweed21> you eventually will get enough flame attacks to make a full flame combo @PatStaresAt
[1:16:54] <%BigCoffee> who cares about a grade
[1:16:56] <%heartlesshealer> there's no blocking if you lose stamina
[1:16:58] <%colezone_> The weakness moves allow you to do the rest of your combo
[1:17:02] <%ainzhelm> JRPG
[1:17:05] <DatAsuna> So a full fire combo is doable
[1:17:05] <%Mattais88> And magic
[1:17:06] <%Dakuu75> is it like Devil May Cry? o combo for style?
[1:17:07] <critiquequartz> You can stun lock bosses with enough combo
[1:17:07] <%kewlmyc> Yeah
[1:17:08] <%baka_sugoi> elemental combos
[1:17:10] <butthurtdave> do combo
[1:17:10] <%NopeBadguy> do the combo
[1:17:11] <dan_g_v> blablabla judgement!
[1:17:15] <%StaceMcGate> Velvet will get like 30 moves
[1:17:15] <BoxFaceStar> Would you play Dead By Daylight with Suzi?
[1:17:17] <$RealThiele> so you upgrade and replace moves ok
[1:17:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Basically.
[1:17:20] <%heartlesshealer> also yes
[1:17:22] <medoodoo> good morning from singapore Pat!
[1:17:25] <Basch71> so yeah basically do combo
[1:17:25] <Cybersoul666> And some moves have dual elements
[1:17:29] <%Master_Van> I assume you are still only controlling Velvet in battle?
[1:17:29] <%NopeBadguy> did you ever get around to fist of the north star lost paradise?
[1:17:30] <jorniev> the prequel was a lot more limited compared to berseria
[1:17:35] <BigFingerRo> VERY BIG DIFFRENT
[1:17:36] <DatAsuna> eh, berseria is fine, but it's one of the least interesting worlds and stories.
[1:17:37] <%dankjerri> you need a trusted source
[1:17:39] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[1:17:40] <dan_g_v> morning, @medoodoo
[1:17:41] <%Alopekis> Then play AGAINST Suzi
[1:17:42] <artoflec> you should try the edgy first party member Pat he has royal guard that gets consecutively stronger each time you land it @PatStaresAt
[1:17:43] <DatAsuna> Lack of originality hurts it a lot
[1:17:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Then you get 4 wind moves for bird enemies and shit
[1:17:45] <%joodatious> but suzi though
[1:17:45] <%ArcanumArcanum> Dont play survivor to win, play survivor to annoy the killer
[1:17:46] <coffeewithmcauley> quokTap
[1:17:47] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt there is missable content, just that the crafting system fucks you over.
[1:17:49] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, needs a guide if you are not used to constant backtracking
[1:17:52] <%JoshManVGH> can make an antire button anti airs
[1:17:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Survivor is the worst
[1:17:54] <BoxFaceStar> It is miserable, you're right there
[1:17:55] <DatAsuna> Play with But also against them
[1:17:55] <%ssjklyco> Would you finish RE Rev 2 with suzie?
[1:17:56] <critiquequartz> You can’t miss anything you can buy the skits at the end if you do
[1:17:56] <%maskofmichael> Because you're bad at it?
[1:18:01] <butthurtdave> It's more fun watching you kill them
[1:18:03] <%BigCoffee> Why just not have a private talk with Mr.Feels? You trust him enough?
[1:18:04] <$RealThiele> paige ans suzi dbd
[1:18:08] <+ScrapKingKeita> DQ8 is better than DQ11, fuck it
[1:18:08] <bakkatohri> Even if you're playing as a group? That's like the optimal thing for playing survivors in DBD.
[1:18:12] <$Futurecity10> Wait there is crafting in berseria?
[1:18:12] <+SaiyanPlague86> Killer is 10x more fun
[1:18:13] <balthazar758> the three amigos
[1:18:13] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt you get more moves later on, like you get a huge slew of them, so like you could fight a bird enemy thats weak to ice, then you make your moveset to target those two specific weaknesses
[1:18:14] <+fetrigon> play with paige, suzie, and eli PunOko PunOko PunOko PunOko PunOko
[1:18:16] <%RetroCop87> JUST IGNORE IT
[1:18:17] <+RedQueensAce> DQXI was so close to greatness
[1:18:20] <$Futurecity10> Oh right lol
[1:18:20] <%joodatious> its real rough in Dairy queen eleven
[1:18:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Why play survivor when you have cool killers?
[1:18:24] <ScreamLord> One of the first signs you're getting old. You gush over kitchen appliances. I got an Air Frier not long ago and it kicks ass
[1:18:24] <PanicSwytch> DQ11 CRAFTING IS EASY
[1:18:26] <+SaiyanPlague86> I kinda bs survivor lmao
[1:18:26] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt You can't play killer with them as survivor?
[1:18:30] <xanerts> pat dont play with guides your first time through
[1:18:32] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt one of the crafting items needed requires gear with no traits on it, which as you progress the game becomes harder to get
[1:18:33] <medoodoo> @dan_g_v morning!
[1:18:36] <%cvp5127> dq11 was one part too long
[1:18:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> @StaceMcGate What content can you miss? All quests are marked with a ! on the world map, no?
[1:18:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt no sidequests, bosses, dungeons, or superweapons are missable and you cant see every skit in 1 playthrough
[1:18:40] <%mikesapartment> play mass effect already
[1:18:41] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt Lowkey I'm a mega tales fan who played even the JP only games. And Even I use cheats instead of doing all the crafting legit.
[1:18:43] <kikoeru_san> oh that's not even the WORST thing
[1:18:46] <%BigCoffee> dq11 crafting -is- easy but you do want to find all the recipes
[1:18:47] <artoflec> the weapon system sucks in Berseria you will goblin out at that
[1:18:49] <+swearinglotus> oh no
[1:18:51] <%Alopekis> It fries the air
[1:18:51] <+PenmanLupine> uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[1:18:52] <%shootbang_exe> shootbang_exe converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:18:52] <%RetroCop87> air fryers are legit
[1:18:52] <%baka_sugoi> air fryer?
[1:18:53] <%StaceMcGate> LAUGH AT PAT WITH NO AIR FRYER

[1:18:59] <%templar010> I want one
[1:18:59] <bakkatohri> Air fryers are such a meme. But they really do work.
[1:19:00] <%king_wragles> It's a small convection oven @PatStaresAt
[1:19:00] <%pokefan9956> nah. that's a real thing
[1:19:00] <tentavision> i just got an air fryer but haven't used it yet

[1:19:02] <%BigCoffee> No it's al alternate oil-less version of frying

Anyways, I tried watching the recording of Jaffe's stream and it was infuriating but hilarious, he ignored a lot of sick burn in his chat.... I think the discourse on Crunch is such a weird shitshow cause there's two kinds of Crunch: The natural kind that happens naturally when there's more stuff to do close to deadlines, and the "Forced March" kinda shit where workers are forced beyond their limits... Forced March is bad

[1:24:05] <stantheman_97> this is a good way to traumatized the kid
[1:24:08] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt can't wait for your child to watch this video in the future
[1:24:10] <%willjar313> Oh Christ I hope Pat's parents aren't watching this...
[1:24:12] <Zalapski> ALL OF THIS IS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE
[1:24:14] <Profmcstevie> What age can the kid draw a better hand turkey
[1:24:15] <Iam_Dead> the greatest prank the devil pulled was making you believe Paige wasn't prego
[1:24:17] <%Rowlander> That was a well spent $5 LUL
[1:24:21] <bakkatohri> Whose child would scrub through hours of stream footage though?
[1:24:24] <%bassoontyphoon> Child protective services would LOVE that

[1:25:25] <peyodogo> sky is the best anime shlock you can find around
[1:25:25] <DatAsuna> He also just ignored anyone getting specific to complain that nobody was being specific

[1:26:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Granted, the times i should have died and walked away unscathed are many so, maybe i'm just durable
[1:26:17] <%derpy_platypus> they gonna have the sex
[1:26:17] <SaltyAzteca> handholding is against twitch reg right?
[1:26:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> let's not test it
[1:26:27] <%Alopekis> Captain Crunch sucks because I can get the knock-off store brand for cheaper, with a larger bag, and it tastes the same.
[1:26:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gotta dump the paint *splortch*
[1:26:46] <Rao2357> Glory to the knockoff brands
[1:26:47] <knight_verse> Domestic Abuse is currently happening, nothing to see here.
[1:26:51] <$RealThiele> Colossal Crunch
[1:27:01] <%blutzwavedave> Honeycombs are S-Tier
[1:27:10] <niffinbox> direct eye contact isn't pg
[1:27:19] <artoflec> yeah honeycomb is underrated imo
[1:27:25] <PanicSwytch> @blutzwavedave THANK U
[1:27:29] <%Alopekis> Anyone buying the non-knockoff cereals are just scamming themselves.
[1:27:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I have reese's pieces corn pops right now, they're ok
[1:27:47] <artoflec> isnt that just reese puffs
[1:27:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I miss that cracked out monster that was the mascot for honeycomb in the 90s
[1:27:55] <$RealThiele> reeses pieces corn pops sounds like diabetes
[1:28:02] <susukouhai> sometimes the knockoffs add something the original was missing.
[1:28:10] <artoflec> i used to love reese puffs now it tastes like poison
[1:28:13] <%Alopekis> Yeah
[1:28:15] <%Alopekis> Like more cereal
[1:28:16] <RedPlasticCup> @abelincoln_catpuncher oh I remember that guy "ME WANT HONEYCOMB" haha
[1:28:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I want fruity pebbles
[1:28:19] <%Alopekis> at a lower price
[1:28:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @artoflec i'm feelign the same
[1:28:30] <%Alopekis> No
[1:28:31] <susukouhai> LUL
[1:28:33] <%Alopekis> You want dino-bites
[1:28:34] <%Shubreaker> my protein powder actually has cinnamon toast crunch pieces in it, it's heavenly
[1:28:36] <artoflec> yeah theres this knockoff chocolate rice krispies that comes in a HUGE bag that is SO GOOD
[1:28:41] <%blutzwavedave> @abelincoln_catpuncher I'm surprised they haven't brought that back, honestly
[1:28:44] <%Alopekis> Or whatever the hell the knockoff fruity pebbles is called
[1:28:48] <%Treuan> @RedPlasticCup I had a nightmare about that guy once. Never ate honeycomb again
[1:28:55] <$RealThiele> cocoa crispies
[1:28:57] <$Futurecity10> I do hope that pat forgets about trails cause its a very large goblin to tackle. The games arent worth the stress
[1:29:15] <%Alopekis> If they made a knockoff honeycombs cereal, I'd eat it every day.
[1:29:22] <artoflec> triple A cereal is vapid, indie cereal can offer a better experience but the package isnt as pretty
[1:29:23] <Rao2357> veggie pebbles
[1:29:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[1:29:45] <artoflec> absolutely disgusting i dont want brocolli cereal
[1:29:57] <%TINMANxHMx> cry capt. crunch is goated
[1:30:01] <%TINMANxHMx> dry*
[1:30:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Maaaan, i so badly want to push a turn based rpg through development
[1:30:06] <%DorianCreed> What's he gone to do now?
[1:30:14] <HarshNerf> do you guys know honey can go on anything, it doesn't have to be on processed grains LUL
[1:30:14] <artoflec> is capt crunch supposed to be like, honey flavored
[1:30:19] <+Punchasaur> Cinnamon toast crunch is my jam
[1:30:19] <%TINMANxHMx> poop probably
[1:30:21] <%blutzwavedave> Take Geif for pee
[1:30:23] <Rao2357> Walk the Gief monster
[1:30:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Honey is great in my tea
[1:30:32] <%Alopekis> Also, anyone who chooses Dr. Pepper over Dr. Perky is scamming theirself.
[1:30:36] <artoflec> is it just barrel flavored
[1:30:38] <%TINMANxHMx> @artoflec regular? I think so, but its hard to place for me
[1:30:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> and in the mead i made
[1:31:01] <artoflec> i find fruit loops awful now too i used to love em
[1:31:05] <%TINMANxHMx> I prefer the peanutbutter crunch
[1:31:07] <artoflec> sorry froot loops
[1:31:14] <%blutzwavedave> @Alopekis I made Dr. Pepper my last soda and had to go name brand. Worth it in my case
[1:31:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I've got 5 liters of apple pie mead ageing until december
[1:31:31] <%Alopekis> @blutzwavedave Never go name-brand.
[1:31:45] <%Alopekis> Always buy the knockoff products
[1:31:50] <%ape_hawk> since pat started me2 late this stream, hes legally obligated to make this stream last longer, right?
[1:31:52] <%ape_hawk> ...right?
[1:31:55] <%Alopekis> I say as I sip my Pepsi
[1:31:57] <+Punchasaur> @harshnerf enjoy honey on your mayonnaise and black olive sandwich
[1:31:58] <%blutzwavedave> @Alopekis Just for the occasion, since I cant drink the stuff anymore :(
[1:32:27] <%Alopekis> @blutzwavedave If it makes you feel better, it really isn't good for you and I should probably stop while I'm ahead.
[1:32:29] <HarshNerf> @punchasaur unironically would be good in focaccia

[1:48:35] <%JobbedBone> justicars are libertarian jedis
[1:48:38] <screwintuna> Nah, that's pretty normal for assassins
[1:48:38] <David_de_Bergerac> see I would design a game where you can punch anyone like Mortal Kombat Deception's Konquest mode
[1:48:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @datasuna one of my first bi crushes
[1:48:46] <DatAsuna> He's neither frog nor fish, moisture kills him

[1:48:55] <peachy996> I mean what?
[1:48:56] <TourettesPlays> @Alopekis and its guaranteed that Samara is going to go after at least a few of the squadmates after the mission ends
[1:48:57] <dukenux> he prays for the guys he murders atleast?
[1:48:58] <nuane> ok Killua
[1:49:00] <David_de_Bergerac> That's fucked up

[1:56:03] <Profmcstevie> He only floats when not observed
[1:56:04] <%Monkeyweed21> why do white people eat cheese by itself?
[1:56:07] <Dunmarkh> Pat doesn't swim, he floats
[1:56:07] <thelonechris> Pat would just float due to the high salt content of his form
[1:56:08] <supergoblinpunch> Just fill the bath up
[1:56:08] <notsoy> which explains why he played skaven in warhammer 2
[1:56:09] <bakkatohri> ngl I'm jealous of the cheese... I want cheese, too.
[1:56:09] <%blutzwavedave> @peyodogo I've been getting that for a while too, actually. Sometimes the galaxy map music sounds like someone's putting a ton of reverb on it. But Pat is always fine
[1:56:12] <@commanderclaw> JACK
[1:56:13] <peachy996> Take Thane
[1:56:15] <%dekkitout> Since Pat's like uber smooth, is he like a leopard seal in the water?

[1:59:11] <Dabrikishaw> See, the sad thing is this mission is only bad because of the way Jacob's character is written. If he was given a few major tweaks in the right places it would be pretty good. Also, don't make the rapist his dad.

[2:01:01] <%StaceMcGate> @GarbageQueenEllie Lord of the Flies if Piggy started a harem
[2:01:01] <%bassoontyphoon> @walternatorz just looked it up it’s present in 2 also
[2:01:02] <%machshop> LUL
[2:01:03] <+Romuken> bruh it's on duracell
[2:01:04] <Broken_Sonex> @CappuccinoGuil He's white Kaiden
[2:01:05] <screwintuna> At least Jacob's dad didn't meld him with a dog
[2:01:08] <%Parapattern> Oh God, Jacob's fucking quest
[2:01:08] <supergoblinpunch> I wish my Dad was a harem Isekai protag
[2:01:14] <David_de_Bergerac> oh I didn't know he was really like that
[2:01:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> @StaceMcGate Lol
[2:01:15] <%Varlinator> Bad Mangos on this planet
[2:01:16] <ioci2112> so why are the guys in this mission using thermal clips if they have been stranded for 8 years? just don't think about it
[2:01:17] <%AzureGale> @CappuccinoGuil He's kinda boring compared to the rest of the crew
[2:01:17] <Jaysky> @CappuccinoGuil I don't hate him but most hate him cause it's not memorable. Boring.
[2:01:18] <ingman112> @CappuccinoGuil He's just a little boring and it's fun for people to rag on him. He can also be shitty in 3 if you romance him, but that's obviously not happening here
[2:01:21] <Pookiedaexzile> @CappuccinoGuil He's a Carth, who cheats on female Shep in 3, but if you didn't play 3 he's just the most boring
[2:01:22] <+SaiyanPlague86> Lmao the fucking googles
[2:01:24] <%valriot> O_O Shepard
[2:01:25] <+FennecZephyr> @CappuccinoGuil He cheats on femshep in the 6 month gap while you're in jain between 2 and 3
[2:01:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Did you not hear ACTING jacob!?!
[2:01:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Broken_Sonex that answered nothing, I don't know Kaiden LUL
[2:01:30] <SomeAsianDood> Wow what an upstanding guy
[2:01:35] <Dabrikishaw> @CappuccinoGuil I don't hate Jacob, but he's a mess of wasted potential and offensive sterotypes about black people that Bioware didn't catch the first time, and made worse over time
[2:01:36] <screwintuna> Get in the Robot, Jacob
[2:01:38] <James_Quivers> pillar of autumn
[2:01:39] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat since you have 2 other biotic with you have you tried out biotic combos???
[2:01:40] <peachy996> @CappuccinoGuil I don't hate him but he's just bland and static from beginning to end. His Dad though...you'll find out
[2:01:51] <Basch71> those goggles make you look like such an asshole LUL
[2:01:54] <Broken_Sonex> @CappuccinoGuil Well he's more boring than Kaiden
[2:01:58] <+vaderxyz1970> now thats a ship name
[2:01:58] <%BigCoffee> @peachy996 he does cheat on femshep
[2:02:02] <%Darksol217> Cheer1060 Sorry for the double message today, but you seemed lost. I thanked you for the parse stuff, because I had asked for how to start doing Static content, and you pointed me to the Balance, and gave me some other basic advice that made me confident enough to start trying. 2 months later i'm where i am, because you gave me the little push of encouragement i needed. Also, as a WHM my damage is Blue and my healing is Purple, which actually means i tend to overheal, so its not THAT impressive.
[2:02:03] <Zalapski> god those goggles
[2:02:05] <David_de_Bergerac> When do you get triple techs
[2:02:09] <Pookiedaexzile> @CappuccinoGuil Best answer
[2:02:10] <%Varlinator> Shepard looks like such an asshole! LUL
[2:02:19] <Dunmarkh> I'm loving these goggles
[2:02:19] <screwintuna> Jacob's dad can't be worse than Britney's
[2:02:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> The fact that Kasumi is hella thirsty for Jacob means she has shit taste
[2:02:26] <dukenux> you look like an good ol space dork in these goggles
[2:02:27] <captain_kirkhammer> Hgo Grnsback started the first sci-fi magazine and is one of the genre's fathers
[2:02:27] <peachy996> @BigCoffee yeah but so what you shouldn't romance jacob anyway.
[2:02:28] <$Futurecity10> Hugo Gernsback ) was a Luxembourgish–American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine.
[2:02:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @peachy996 oh goodie
[2:02:41] <%walternatorz> @bassoontyphoon ah, thanks. forgot that completely
[2:02:46] <David_de_Bergerac> gosh you look like a failed terminator
[2:02:55] <%Ranryu692> Jacob's dad is such a monster that it almost makes the Reapers justified LUL
[2:02:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> @BigCoffee oooooh he's a cheater? Yeet this man into the sun
[2:03:02] <%StaceMcGate> oh right, not just a harem, but a harem of mentally cognitive impaired vvomen
[2:03:03] <%sunsetdisc0> @PatStaresAt which recruitment/loyalty mission is your favorite
[2:03:04] <thelonechris> The space coconuts made him crazy
[2:03:05] <%bassoontyphoon> @walternatorz it’s wayyyy more in depth in 3 though
[2:03:06] <%BigCoffee> @peachy996 I mean you could, if you didn't know. He's not a bad guy and maybe you find the human beefcake handsome? But the aliens are all so much more interesting ^^;;
[2:03:12] <SomeAsianDood> You mean the one in game or in the camera? @David_de_Bergerac
[2:03:13] <blackjack8182> He’s a great guy…..just like his son
[2:03:16] <ingman112> Also everyone remember that Jacob's dad is Lee from TWD
[2:03:18] <DefaultSettiings> so does that mean we can fuck the hologram or not
[2:03:26] <peachy996> I THINK this was the first loyalty mission I ever did and boy did it leave an impression
[2:03:29] <%Monkeyweed21> he waited almost 9 YEARS
[2:03:35] <David_de_Bergerac> @someasiandood Whichever one is funnier
[2:03:43] <+Romuken> blind
[2:03:49] <ingman112> Wrong way for the ship
[2:03:50] <+Romuken> wait was it ignore that
[2:03:53] <+vaderxyz1970> I cant wait for Mass Effect 4 to have the James S.A Corry and B.V. Larson ships
[2:03:54] <%walternatorz> maybe someone got a conch
[2:03:56] <%baka_sugoi> SPACE F O O D
[2:03:58] <SaltyAzteca> No he got the spare parts
[2:03:58] <dukenux> i mean hes "relatively" not a bad guy. he still works for Cerberus
[2:03:59] <Profmcstevie> It really makem you THINK
[2:04:02] <TourettesPlays> Pat go to the ship
[2:04:03] <+chester804> the 9 year orgy, who would wanna stop that
[2:04:05] <peachy996> Yeah
[2:04:09] <+Romuken> THOSE ARE PALM TREES BRUH
[2:04:10] <$SGrim> @Monkeyweed21 Because of THE PRIZE!
[2:04:12] <+RaveBV> LUL
[2:04:13] <%hat_under_bread> It's fine tho.
[2:04:16] <+vaderxyz1970> And the Hammilton
[2:04:16] <Josef_Stryker> It's fiiiiiiine
[2:04:17] <David_de_Bergerac> What if you lost your vision and the only way to fix it was to have goggles like that
[2:04:17] <+dakarplaugas> Tali and Garrus just fucking die
[2:04:17] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt I'm doing a renegade playthrough and I'm purposefully gonna kill Jacob and Miranda during the final mission
[2:04:17] <%Parapattern> Almost like it sucks
[2:04:18] <blackjack8182> Yep
[2:04:18] <ingman112> Just Tali and Garrus lol
[2:04:18] <%blutzwavedave> GOOD THING JACOB WASN'T THERE, EH?
[2:04:19] <tattleworm> which is why the extended cut shows them taking off
[2:04:19] <%walternatorz> maybe someone got the assmar
[2:04:20] <+dakarplaugas> or the rest
[2:04:20] <captain_kirkhammer> If you choose synthesis they probably were able to fix the ship up real quick
[2:04:21] <Jaysky> Not if one ending has it's way
[2:04:21] <peachy996> And they're like "Aw yeah hug me Edi"
[2:04:23] <DatAsuna> "we have food at home"
[2:04:26] <SomeAsianDood> No but shut up though
[2:04:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ugh. fuck that ending.
[2:04:28] <@Velyndra> bruh drn speed run sanic fast 12 min 30 sec ez game
[2:04:29] <+dakarplaugas> Dumb
[2:04:31] <James_Quivers> they all ate Jacob and survived
[2:04:36] <wembleyttv> Another thing I don't get with the mass effect 3 endings all mass effect relays get blown up that means YOUR FUCKED
[2:04:40] <%Monkeyweed21> at LEAST 2 of them would starve
[2:04:40] <Jaysky> Green ending anyone can eat whatever though
[2:04:41] <stantheman_97> garrus and tali are fucked
[2:04:43] <$Solid_Stro> Yeah the writers just ASSUMED that everyone understood what they were driving at with the ending
[2:04:44] <Profmcstevie> "no Garrus, ass is not nutritional content"
[2:04:44] <David_de_Bergerac> Hackerz 1999
[2:04:45] <ioci2112> in the extended cut they fix the ship up super fast if your ems is high enough
[2:04:47] <Ardailec> you could go in it?
[2:04:54] <stantheman_97> or everyone but them is fucked
[2:04:54] <EasternEagle21> Oh my god I forgot how much I hate this mission's premise
[2:04:55] <%KaiserMario> This is one of the most Star Trek missions in ME
[2:05:00] <@Velyndra> Velyndra subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! yes
[2:05:01] <+vaderxyz1970> hackerman
[2:05:02] <TourettesPlays> Isn't this planet a bit of a rehash of Rakata Prime?
[2:05:09] <%kyh9> Which is this?
[2:05:10] <dukenux> they prolly have magical star trek food processors or some shit
[2:05:14] <captain_kirkhammer> doo-doo process
[2:05:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Who thought it was smart to blow up the Mass Effect relays that hold the universe together from a writing perspective
[2:05:15] <%blutzwavedave> DooDoo LUL
[2:05:19] <%KaiserMario> LUL doodoo process
[2:05:21] <%dekkitout> @Profmcstevie Garrus: "Well that's what someone who doesn't live fast would say"
[2:05:23] <Dabrikishaw> @wembleyttv That was from back when we would have gotten the Dark Enegry ending. It's a holdover
[2:05:24] <+CookieCutter007> GOTTEM
[2:05:24] <%HairballCT> can't expect the luxury of doo doo process LUL
[2:05:25] <Pookiedaexzile> "We wish for nothing else to EVER HAPPEN"
[2:05:26] <HeroToxiko> they couldn't eat each other either monkaS
[2:05:26] <+SaiyanPlague86> Doodoodoo
[2:05:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> "Can't expect doodoo process" LUL
[2:05:32] <%kyh9> OH GOD IS THIS JACOB'S LOYALTY

[2:05:55] <Profmcstevie> Oh no they're ENGLISH ACCENTED
[2:05:58] <%ComfortableStranger> pat knows how to save everyone, there's less than a 1% chance anyone is gonna die, not for Paige's run all the women squad members will die, obviously
[2:05:59] <%HairballCT> monkaS
[2:06:01] <David_de_Bergerac> Kill Jacob for more time on the clock
[2:06:03] <%StaceMcGate> oof

[2:06:18] <tanarath> OH BOY
[2:06:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> OH NOOOOOOOO
[2:06:19] <Broken_Sonex> OHHHHH I SEE
[2:06:20] <peachy996> Sounds great!
[2:06:21] <David_de_Bergerac> is he okay
[2:06:23] <ingman112> No that was Steve Blum
[2:06:24] <%Treuan> hmmm
[2:06:25] <Pookiedaexzile> This mission has Some of the best dialogue if you haven't been to that one Missi (ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL) NO SPOILERS Shepard
[2:06:25] <%MidnightBurst12> fuck that
[2:06:26] <%StoopKid241> Omg
[2:06:27] <aiutare47> BLUM NO
[2:06:28] <scarman125> wait what? fucking eww.
[2:06:29] <stantheman_97> slowly losing my memory over time is one of my biggest fears
[2:06:29] <%JohnAtDawn> REMINDER THAT IN THE US ARMY WOMEN HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF BEING RAPED
[2:06:32] <Broken_Sonex> UH OH JACOB
[2:06:32] <%bassoontyphoon> WutFace WutFace WutFace VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:06:33] <tanarath> MORALLY GREY
[2:06:36] <ingman112> That was not Jacob's dad, in his defense
[2:06:37] <%Torus1025> This mission is the worst lol
[2:06:38] <+chester804> oh no! its' not orgy island its the bad kind!
[2:06:40] <%ape_hawk> she didnt like my space dick pics
[2:06:40] <dukenux> hyper rapey vibes right outta the gates
[2:06:41] <willyfreshness> being a scumbag runs in the family
[2:06:44] <%ComfortableStranger> @ingman112 correct
[2:06:45] <brisk_dacat> why do this to the blk guy
[2:06:47] <%Varlinator> bad mangos makes the brain go bad
[2:06:47] <greene411> They must have really liked brown décor when they built ship
[2:06:49] <%bassoontyphoon> Priiiiiiiiize
[2:06:49] <%StaceMcGate> Blum voices like 5 characters in this game, and they are all scumbags (including Grunt)
[2:06:59] <David_de_Bergerac> what if you couldn't remember before you got your goggle eyes and you thought you were born like that
[2:07:04] <zerointelligence000> Came in for the BEST quest
[2:07:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Time to meet one of the other 3 black people in space
[2:07:08] <%hat_under_bread> wholesome 100
[2:07:09] <+Romuken> hmmmm
[2:07:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Shes regressed kill her
[2:07:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> This is quite literally Space Lord of the Flies
[2:07:18] <captain_kirkhammer> yYeah but Grunt is a really fun scumback
[2:07:19] <+chester804> paragon interupt
[2:07:21] <EasternEagle21> So my favorite thing about the endings is that it wouldn't even have been that hard to fix. They could have given the reapers are more basic but understandable reason to harvest everyone (lifeforms, organic and synthetic equally) constantly drive each other to extinction (through overpopulation, resource depletion, interspecies conflict, etc, and that so far no civilization has managed to rally themselves together to avoid this).
[2:07:21] <greene411> I LOVE THE LEADER
[2:07:24] <David_de_Bergerac> I wouls design a game where characters would stumble for a second at the sight of you
[2:07:25] <SomeAsianDood> hmmm she seems fine
[2:07:29] <%ComfortableStranger> "you are cursed with his face!...and his ass!"
[2:07:31] <peachy996> Oh my god Pat. You look like Robotnik
[2:07:32] <Dova573> Mannnnn I forgot this loyalty mission
[2:07:35] <dukenux> MAKE SENSE DAMMIT
[2:07:42] <Pookiedaexzile> HIS BRAND
[2:07:42] <peachy996> You look like if Robotnik shaved his mustach
[2:07:44] <David_de_Bergerac> @peachy996 HE DOES
[2:07:45] <SaltyAzteca> GOOD GUY SHEPAT
[2:07:51] <DefaultSettiings> imagine being in this situation; and your "saviour" struts up to you wearing those asshole goggles
[2:07:51] <David_de_Bergerac> WHA HAPPA
[2:07:53] <BigFingerRo> Man, Pat Shepard looks like such an asshole with those glasses
[2:07:54] <peachy996> Patbotnik
[2:07:56] <dukenux> EVIL PAT
[2:07:58] <+RaveBV> HE HAS SPECIAL EYES
[2:07:58] <%Parapattern> "I'll use my special goggle vision to solve the problems."
[2:08:01] <screwintuna> oof AGENTS OF THE LIAR
[2:08:05] <Latija> evil mark meer
[2:08:05] <screwintuna> bad line read
[2:08:08] <David_de_Bergerac> It's me the agent of the liar
[2:08:08] <hairtoday> so these guys are on your side
[2:08:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> These poor bastards. Shame you can't let them live.
[2:08:12] <greene411> Na na na na na leader
[2:08:13] <tanarath> Ok, lets see how thermal clips exist here
[2:08:14] <%JobbedBone> this is like a star trek episode LUL actual sci-fi, with moral questions, in my space video game?
[2:08:14] <EasternEagle21> And then the way you beat the reapers is just by having a really good army, and suddenly you not only beat the reapers but prove wrong their entire thesis (that lifeforms cannot work together well enough to avoid extinction)
[2:08:15] <%HairballCT> not with that attitude
[2:08:16] <%StaceMcGate> SHEPARD BRING A TASER FOR GOD'S SAKE
[2:08:21] <+chester804> Pat is murdering these people with mental disabilities!
[2:08:22] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> realizing i have never heard Samara's battle dialogue
[2:08:26] <willyfreshness> nothing says Feral like shields and Laser shotguns
[2:08:32] <SiameseSneeze> are you sure about that Jacob?
[2:08:33] <+vaderxyz1970> That guy was frozen then went strait to thermal compustion
[2:08:35] <+fetrigon> QUEEEEN KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:08:35] <%hat_under_bread> I like how there are thermal clips here.
[2:08:36] <tanarath> MY FATHER WOULD NEVER
[2:08:37] <scarman125> Jacob take a fucking hint man
[2:08:41] <%kyh9> Oh but your father WOULD let this go on
[2:08:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> Jacob inhaling that copium
[2:08:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Samaras Battle Dialogue is dangerously distracting
[2:08:45] <+Romuken> there's a fucking MIND MELDER RIGHT THERE
[2:08:48] <screwintuna> Get in the robot Jacob
[2:08:50] <SaltyAzteca> Wait I think I remember this side quest
[2:08:50] <%Varlinator> Not MY Dad. Never
[2:08:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Can't be nutting mid battle
[2:08:52] <Psyramics> 'feral' these people are objectively correct
[2:08:55] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt PAT YOU LOOK LIKE ROBOTNIK
[2:08:56] <%Torus1025> That was completely lucid wtf do you mean Jacob
[2:08:56] <jorniev> JACOBS DAD WENT FULL APOCALYPSE NOW!
[2:08:59] <blackjack8182> Copium
[2:09:01] <David_de_Bergerac> This game is the perfect scapegoat for my argument about how game designers don't think you'll see everything and think about plot holes
[2:09:05] <ScreamLord> So it's not bad enough that Jacob's dad created a Rape Cult he made all his victims mentally handicapped too
[2:09:06] <dukenux> you doing a renegade run? @patstaresat
[2:09:08] <TourettesPlays> @StaceMcGate Kind of hilarious that there's so many of these space age fire arms and not one of them is a stun weapon lol
[2:09:13] <ingman112> Kotor 1?
[2:09:19] <willyfreshness> The planet Far Cry 3
[2:09:20] <screwintuna> "good"
[2:09:20] <%justcallmebobplease> "Quick Samara, fuck this neurally degenerated trauma victim to get us intel!"
[2:09:25] <+SilverDevilfish> Man I can't wait to see Jacob meet his dad and ALMOST have an emotion
[2:09:25] <+SaiyanPlague86> Jacob's dad did nothing wrong
[2:09:36] <EasternEagle21> Hey isn't it weird that this 10 year old ship is still using thermal clips?
[2:09:39] <%StaceMcGate> look at this totally-not-a-harem
[2:09:40] <%ComfortableStranger> it's the same assets from the zaeed mission
[2:09:42] <SomeAsianDood> all wahmen
[2:09:43] <dukenux> hmmmm
[2:09:45] <+fetrigon> SAMARAAAAAAAA KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:09:50] <scarman125> omg really
[2:09:52] <Dabrikishaw> Oh yeah, why don't these guys have the infinite ammo guns from mass effect 1
[2:09:54] <DatAsuna> or men are just that way normally :P
[2:09:57] <SaltyAzteca> I wish Mordin was here
[2:09:59] <penitentpendant> He made a harem~
[2:10:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Makes Males get violent and women quiet? Oh so ESPN
[2:10:00] <%Dakuu75> wtf...
[2:10:01] <%Torus1025> They go so far out of the way to make him the WORST
[2:10:02] <dukenux> men of wö
[2:10:02] <James_Quivers> SIGMA VIRUS
[2:10:04] <hairtoday> wearing collars, real subtle
[2:10:06] <arkv01> i smell snu snu
[2:10:07] <ingman112> @Dabrikishaw There's a mod that actually does that
[2:10:08] <David_de_Bergerac> If I liked how this game played I would probably have a ton of fun with how silly this all is
[2:10:09] <morningmoondude> OH NO THE WHOLE PLANET IS RACIST
[2:10:11] <SiameseSneeze> wtf Jacob
[2:10:11] <%mads_valentine> This is lame.
[2:10:12] <%YakumoYomi> Welp...
[2:10:12] <HeroToxiko> oh no MORMONS
[2:10:14] <peachy996> oof getting better
[2:10:15] <+neonNeptunian> whuh oh
[2:10:15] <DatAsuna> cursed with his face
[2:10:16] <Josef_Stryker> Cursed with the face of Kanye
[2:10:16] <+WaywardSera> That's pretty unambiguous
[2:10:17] <David_de_Bergerac> PFHAAAAAHAHA

[2:11:02] <%maskofmichael> So is this were you get the cigarettes?
[2:11:09] <RedPlasticCup> cmonBruh
[2:11:10] <DatAsuna> "borderline"
[2:11:13] <%Parapattern> Shouldn't Samara waste Jacob's dad the second she lays eyes on him?
[2:11:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Yung Eggman
[2:11:17] <%YakumoYomi> SEED of the OPPRESSOR!
[2:11:19] <TourettesPlays> @maskofmichael fucking lmao
[2:11:20] <TioXyco> not borderline when it in fact IS worshiping
[2:11:20] <DefaultSettiings> shepard needs a greasy, thin beard to go with the shithead goggles
[2:11:23] <David_de_Bergerac> What the hell is borderline worship
[2:11:24] <+CookieCutter007> is his dad running a harem
[2:11:25] <testis1> play sf3 bitch
[2:11:26] <SaltyAzteca> STRIKE
[2:11:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> @peachy996 I miss my wife, Tali- I miss her a lot.

[2:11:35] <+neonNeptunian> s w a g
[2:11:40] <%ape_hawk> sure, jacob
[2:11:41] <+SaiyanPlague86> Jacob's dad is the Jesus of the ME universe
[2:11:44] <screwintuna> stop trying to rationalize it bro
[2:11:44] <+OneGorillionDollars> KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT
[2:11:46] <captain_kirkhammer> @HeroToxiko which one, mike
[2:11:51] <+vaderxyz1970> Wow he really in denile
[2:11:53] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Your Shepard looks like Robotnik
[2:11:54] <%JobbedBone> thats not true at all
[2:11:58] <+chester804> there a mango about this somewhere in the world, and its probably in the works for an anime adaptation
[2:12:03] <screwintuna> THE PRODIGAL SON
[2:12:03] <+chester804> manga*
[2:12:09] <+Punchasaur> Parkour
[2:12:11] <jorniev> JACOBS DAD is probably super fat and Bald and saying the horror a lot
[2:12:13] <dukenux> @defaultsettiings he needs an outrageous red moustache so he looks like dr Robotnik
[2:12:14] <+RaveBV> It is his DESTINY.
[2:12:16] <%washicka> I don't like what her eyes are doing
[2:12:16] <PineapplePlatypus> FIREFLY
[2:12:18] <%blutzwavedave> We need to Bring Down the Sky
[2:12:32] <+JaseAdrift> Those goggles pat is wearing are terrible
[2:12:42] <screwintuna> reasonable
[2:12:45] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko Yeah discovery
[2:12:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Jacob's Dad is CRACKED
[2:12:54] <+Punchasaur> Shepherd looks like mr. Freeze
[2:12:56] <SomeAsianDood> WHAT A HERO
[2:12:57] <%Daxalog> Jesus Christ. This feels like an Early Star Trek episode.
[2:12:57] <%Varlinator> You're Dad's a Diiiiiiiiick dude
[2:13:02] <Pookiedaexzile> look at his KD
[2:13:02] <+vaderxyz1970> A man who says he's king is no king
[2:13:02] <%JoshManVGH> So... the food didn't impare memory or make people dumb, it seems like it just made them have difficulty to communicate
[2:13:04] <+RaveBV> The goggles are used to contain Pat's special eyes.
[2:13:06] <David_de_Bergerac> his goggles go well with that lady's eyebrows
[2:13:08] <+RaveBV> Yikes
[2:13:08] <%YabbaTroll> yiiiiiikes
[2:13:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> EEEEEWWWW
[2:13:13] <knight_verse> Shepard looks like he
[2:13:17] <aiutare47> Rape and slavery = not command material
[2:13:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Crackkked
[2:13:19] <+neonNeptunian> THAT'S A HAREM
[2:13:21] <TourettesPlays> THINK JACOB THINK YOUR MOM WAS LIKE A PET TO ME
[2:13:21] <+chester804> big fucking yikes....
[2:13:22] <%HairballCT> what the actual goddamn FUCK
[2:13:22] <lord_sykos> This is so much worse than I remembered
[2:13:23] <EasternEagle21> So, if you read the codex you will find that the widespread use and reliance on mechs has only been a thing for the past 2 years since the attack on the citadel. It makes no sense that this 10 year old ship would have any.
[2:13:23] <+fetrigon> yikes
[2:13:25] <Dragovus> Always a good idea to make you ship's Doctor have neural decay
[2:13:30] <peachy996> Yeeeeaaahhh that's a bad
[2:13:30] <%JobbedBone> one handmaid, please
[2:13:31] <nuane> I love Space Waco
[2:13:32] <%Daxalog> Im digging the Nightmare Vision Goggles
[2:13:36] <+chester804> Jacobs dad was probably a cop before this lol
[2:13:38] <knight_verse> Shepard looks like he got lost on his way to the nerd convention.
[2:13:41] <%bassoontyphoon> This is a big yiiiikes
[2:13:41] <David_de_Bergerac> If you eat enough toxic food you win a prize
[2:13:43] <+Romuken> so did they eat babies?
[2:13:45] <morningmoondude> The one black character's father just runs a harem and kills every other man around. Sounds like a normal one.
[2:13:49] <DefaultSettiings> it is not possible to have a legitimate conversation with someone wearing goggles like that
[2:13:53] <%Ranryu692> I like the way Shepard phrases that
[2:13:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> this is like some fucked up hentai shit
[2:13:58] <%JoshManVGH> He intentionallyed a cult.
[2:14:05] <David_de_Bergerac> Space Toxoplasmosis
[2:14:06] <peachy996> I have to credit Bioware for giving the most boring squadmat one of the most fucked up loyalty missions
[2:14:07] <TourettesPlays> @EasternEagle21 yea yea and Zaeed mentions thermal clips when talking about old missions he ran it makes sense shut up
[2:14:07] <captain_kirkhammer> @EasternEagle21 it also makes no sense given that citadel space has like a quadrillion citizens and sovereign killed a few hundred thousand maximum
[2:14:07] <zerointelligence000> This was easily one of the darkest missions for one of the worst characters
[2:14:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> PAT WHY THE GOGGLES
[2:14:09] <screwintuna> Everybody's parents have problems ok
[2:14:16] <%twistedj3ster> someone was playing renpy shit before the crash
[2:14:18] <SaltyAzteca> Thats fucked up
[2:14:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Speaking to them, taking them out on dates, Promises of Marriage, Look at what these weak things need to match a fraction of our Beacons rape powers
[2:14:27] <Brandon__Brando> oh ya your in this game
[2:14:29] <%JobbedBone> we've all seen this ocarina of time doujinshi
[2:14:29] <DatAsuna> even a month is suspiscioulsy long
[2:14:30] <dukenux> hes a dollar store Colonel Kurtz
[2:14:31] <+Romuken> oh god his model is fucked
[2:14:37] <Podakdrank> I'm here
[2:14:42] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt You look like Robotnik
[2:14:43] <jorniev> wow Jacob your dad is way shittier than you
[2:14:44] <David_de_Bergerac> @jobbedbone I know I have
[2:14:47] <EasternEagle21> @EasternEagle21 Bad retconning is bad retconning lol
[2:14:48] <BentArcher> ~No one man should have all that power~
[2:14:49] <James_Quivers> The explaination is that the dude was HORNY HORNY
[2:14:51] <morningmoondude> So is this mission how you all imagined MADDENTOWN was?
[2:14:57] <Lamokmok> Kazuya: Throw your father off the cliff
[2:14:58] <%HairballCT> psaBig BOOM
[2:14:59] <%StaceMcGate> Jacob's father should've just fucked the robots
[2:15:00] <+neonNeptunian> b o o m
[2:15:01] <David_de_Bergerac> Big mood
[2:15:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh god
[2:15:03] <greatspaceadventure> oh fuck you DO look like a Robotnik type LUL
[2:15:07] <+chester804> he needs to go to horny jail
[2:15:07] <SiameseSneeze> Fuck you Jacob
[2:15:07] <Pookiedaexzile> this is Space Madden Town
[2:15:09] <%Monkeyweed21> STAND NEXT TO IT
[2:15:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Guys, Jacob + Stranded = Jacob's Dad
[2:15:10] <%RyTYoung> YEAAAAH
[2:15:10] <%ape_hawk> ITS LEE
[2:15:12] <zerointelligence000> Is that LEE?
[2:15:17] <David_de_Bergerac> Jacob was like "oh shit"
[2:15:18] <thelonechris> I doubt that explosion would have even hurt them
[2:15:19] <%Varlinator> tickled the shields
[2:15:19] <Broken_Sonex> OMG IT'S LEE
[2:15:21] <SomeAsianDood> It is lee
[2:15:23] <+chester804> this is actually Lee's VA
[2:15:24] <peachy996> Yes it is Lee
[2:15:25] <%StaceMcGate> lee
[2:15:25] <%condemned_15> LUL
[2:15:27] <David_de_Bergerac> Kill the daddeh
[2:15:28] <%blutzwavedave> Clementine will remember that
[2:15:29] <%Varlinator> Dave Fenoy nooooooo
[2:15:31] <+critikal_bit> That's totally Lee!
[2:15:34] <%bassoontyphoon> Keep your hair short Clem
[2:15:34] <SaltyAzteca> YES ITS LEE
[2:15:38] <+fetrigon> LEEEEE KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:15:43] <%OrangeMDT> So why is there Jacob hate? So far it seems like he hates his dad properly
[2:15:45] <Broken_Sonex> THAT'S LEE'S VA
[2:15:46] <%DracosMagala> Lee, What happened? WHERE'S CLEMITINE??? LUL LUL LUL
[2:15:48] <Broken_Sonex> OH NO
[2:15:48] <willyfreshness> Shame we didn't do this Mission on Fathers Day
[2:15:50] <zerointelligence000> Oh god without Clemintine he's a piece of shit
[2:15:50] <David_de_Bergerac> Jacob's dad shows up in front of the moon and tells Jacob to Kill God
[2:15:52] <aiutare47> “This is Captain Ronald Taylor, ever read Heart of Darkness?”
[2:15:52] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko tbh i think every series has a version of this when starfleet people get stuck on a planet for years.
[2:15:52] <ingman112> LEE YOU FUCK
[2:15:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no its Silent Leee
[2:15:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> God I love that move
[2:15:59] <TourettesPlays> 360 no hit
[2:16:01] <%Torus1025> "Jacob I'm going to shoot your dad"
[2:16:05] <Brandon__Brando> 360 no scope
[2:16:07] <thelonechris> "Hey Ben?" "Yeah?" "See ya."
[2:16:09] <+Punchasaur> Are those redeads
[2:16:10] <DatAsuna> Where is charles lee?
[2:16:13] <SaltyAzteca> PULL!
[2:16:15] <iosephe> 10 years and they have the latest mechs and reloading heatsinks
[2:16:16] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> FOOTBALL
[2:16:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @OrangeMDT this mission is the most interesting Jacob will EVER get, also he cheats on you in 3
[2:16:19] <Broken_Sonex> SCUMBAG LEE IS REAL
[2:16:20] <David_de_Bergerac> JACOB, The TIME of the GOSPEL is NOW
[2:16:24] <peachy996> @OrangeMDT Based on Jacob as a person. It's not because of this mission
[2:16:26] <penitentpendant> Homerun
[2:16:26] <%Varlinator> Seee ya
[2:16:26] <morningmoondude> i hope Woolie LPs these games at some point. His reaction to this whole bit would be *AMAZING*
[2:16:28] <SomeAsianDood> punted to orbit
[2:16:30] <$RealThiele> oh god it was crawling
[2:16:38] <+Romuken> So if you shockwave/lift someone, and charge them, would they explode cause it's 2 biotic abilities?
[2:16:40] <+dakarplaugas> God the music sounds so scuffed when you charge
[2:16:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woolie would love this mission
[2:16:46] <peachy996> I think Woolie has played ME before
[2:16:52] <+withguac> 360 no scope
[2:16:52] <screwintuna> SUPER PAT
[2:17:00] <EasternEagle21> @iosephe Imagine how cool it would have been to find like, the one heatsinking gun in the game on this mission, like you can in 3.
[2:17:01] <%StaceMcGate> @morningmoondude Woolie will be right on this 2009 game in 2029, dont you know
[2:17:02] <blackjack8182> Pistol upgrade
[2:17:02] <TourettesPlays> "Gravity's one mean mother" the one cool thing Jacob says
[2:17:02] <captain_kirkhammer> @peachy996 only the first one
[2:17:03] <iosephe> yay
[2:17:04] <peachy996> But I bet Reggie hasn't
[2:17:04] <morningmoondude> Woolie only played ME1
[2:17:04] <$RealThiele> yeetus deletus
[2:17:05] <zerointelligence000> Woolie said he only played the first one
[2:17:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie will never play Mass Effect
[2:17:09] <David_de_Bergerac> Is this a better game for if I didn't like the gameplay originally
[2:17:12] <Dio_TR> Yo Scarlet nexus is fucking lit
[2:17:22] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:17:26] <%StaceMcGate> robot went home
[2:17:27] <peachy996> byyyyyyyyyyee
[2:17:29] <Brandon__Brando> I love the biotic classes so much
[2:17:33] <olm46> That guy got Shepharded
[2:17:34] <LluthyY> Lol!
[2:17:34] <SaltyAzteca> Have you ever seen anything so beautiful BibleThump
[2:17:36] <%Varlinator> There's no stasis in ME2 besides Shadow Broker right?
[2:17:37] <stantheman_97> LUL
[2:17:38] <$RealThiele> follow him
[2:17:40] <SomeAsianDood> TO THE MOOOOn
[2:17:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie would spen hours on meaningless Paragon/Renegade choices
[2:17:41] <morningmoondude> Reggie would be shitting his pants and Woolie would start telling the story about Maddentown and drop a nugget of lore on his dad
[2:17:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Biotics are the shit.
[2:17:45] <Dunmarkh> sent that fucker into orbit
[2:17:46] <James_Quivers> Woolie is too much of a coward to hook up with the aliens
[2:17:47] <%dekkitout> Who needs mass relays, amitite tajC
[2:17:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> I legit would love if Woolie played New Vegas or The Outer Worlds
[2:17:58] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[2:17:59] <%YakumoYomi> I hope this reckless play doesn't get Pat killed in ME3. Your health doesn't fully regen in that game.
[2:18:00] <aiutare47> @varlinator it’s added in SB
[2:18:11] <captain_kirkhammer> @CappuccinoGuil outer worlds gets kinda bad after the first planet tbh
[2:18:11] <Brandon__Brando> I forgot how broken this class was
[2:18:14] <%maskofmichael> @Monkeyweed21 and at least three streams reading the lore
[2:18:17] <TioXyco> yeah it is your father Jackob
[2:18:17] <$RealThiele> years to train robots?
[2:18:24] <HeroToxiko> @David_de_Bergerac i skipped the first and liked the rest, thats a bioware thing tho, gameplay being prioritized later on
[2:18:30] <Broken_Sonex> NAH JACOB YOUR DAD IS LEE ISN'T THAT COOL?!
[2:18:33] <SaltyAzteca> BIG ROBOT
[2:18:39] <morningmoondude> So let's say Woolie=Jacob, and this is MADDENTOWN. Would that make Cerberus Grenada?
[2:18:40] <%MugenSandan> Let's just emphasize again THE FIRST AND LAST BLACK TEAM MEMBER EVERYONE
[2:18:46] <EasternEagle21> @Brandon__Brando It's only good on low difficulties. On hardcore and instanity vanguard is way harder to play than literally any other class, especially soldier and sentinel
[2:18:57] <TourettesPlays> @CappuccinoGuil Woolie playing New Vegas might actually give me an aneurysm i can imagine him doing everything wrong, giving his character 8 Ch or something
[2:18:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @maskofmichael there would be entire episodes of Woolie misinterpreting the Codex entries cuz of his awful narrative literacy
[2:19:06] <scarman125> man the ai really just ignores the rest of your party huh
[2:19:13] <David_de_Bergerac> have fun, Pat. take care. blast aliens for me
[2:19:20] <+vaderxyz1970> how is it that none of these robots required maintenance for the past 10 years
[2:19:21] <TrollKing96> Doesn't Pat have grenades?
[2:19:26] <+Romuken> Jacobcalled those brainwashed slaves TOYS
[2:19:29] <TourettesPlays> @scarman125 I mean the game ends if you die but not them so yea
[2:19:31] <+SilverDevilfish> "people = toys" - Jacob
[2:19:34] <dukenux> "Jacob, hope this will to not affect our professional relationship, but i am going to murder your dad... Unless you want do it yoursel"
[2:19:34] <Josef_Stryker> Lee, what have you done!
[2:19:34] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:19:35] <%StaceMcGate> seriously, Shepard should really carry some mace or tear gas @PatStaresAt killing innocent people here
[2:19:36] <blackjack8182> Liam in Andromeda was written by Jacob’s writer and is somehow WORSE!
[2:19:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> @captain_kirkhammer still really damn fun, though. I think the worlds don't get better than Edgewater, but they are still good.
[2:19:40] <Pookiedaexzile> "Homies over Hoes" JAcob
[2:19:41] <%twistedj3ster> "I went on a power trip"
[2:19:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I would actually respect him more if he just said that
[2:19:43] <peachy996> His reasons suck
[2:19:44] <penitentpendant> "I wanted to give you siblings, Jacob!"
[2:19:45] <dukenux> *yourself?
[2:19:46] <%ItalianWaifu> One woman just inst enough for me say Jacob....'s dad
[2:19:47] <$RealThiele> i need mind slaves to nutt
[2:19:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Think Jacob Think
[2:19:49] <%maskofmichael> @Monkeyweed21 And the podcast where he and Pat yell at each other about it
[2:19:53] <EasternEagle21> @CappuccinoGuil Yeah, New Vegas has a really weird stat system that takes a lot of meta knowledge to optimize. It's not too bad playing an unoptimal character though, and he isn't as OCD as Pat is about doing so.
[2:19:53] <blackjack8182> Renegade
[2:19:56] <Dabrikishaw> @MugenSandan Yep. Crying shame
[2:20:02] <%Gogogolem> Listen, I could find any lombaxes.
[2:20:02] <%StaceMcGate> THE BLOODLINE JACOB, WE HAD TO CONTINUE IT FURTHER
[2:20:06] <James_Quivers> Jacob, what I did here was risky... BUT THE PRIIIIIZE
[2:20:17] <Pookiedaexzile> THERES STUFF
[2:20:17] <dukenux> "i was horny Jacob"
[2:20:19] <Pookiedaexzile> GET THE STUFF
[2:20:22] <zerointelligence000> Remember Jacob... Don't betray your loved ones
[2:20:22] <%Mattais88> Yeah, how did no one get preggers 10 years on sex slave world?
[2:20:24] <Dragovus> Banish him to space jail!
[2:20:28] <peachy996> Hey Lee
[2:20:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Look at this nerd
[2:20:31] <blackjack8182> Hi Lee
[2:20:35] <aiutare47> The question is do you do it or make him do it
[2:20:39] <$RealThiele> thats gonna be some rough post nutt clarity
[2:20:40] <%Treuan> Total loss huh
[2:20:41] <captain_kirkhammer> @Mattais88 malnutrition fucks fertility
[2:20:42] <%DracosMagala> Evil Lee PokGengar
[2:20:43] <Jaysky> Total loss, eh?
[2:20:43] <HeroToxiko> i just remembered what trek episode this reminds me of, the crystalline entity saga
[2:20:43] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 IKR

[2:21:00] <ScreamLord> "I did WANT build a harem of mentally handicapped women and kill to dude! It just happuned."
[2:21:01] <%demiiluna> Shepard is wearing his nightmare vision goggles huh
[2:21:03] <bakkatohri> Clemmy wouldn't approve, Space Lee
[2:21:04] <ingman112> Total scum
[2:21:05] <peachy996> The music is so on point too
[2:21:09] <EasternEagle21> Oh my god he tries to play it up as primitive tribalism. It's even worse than I thought it was.
[2:21:09] <$RealThiele> big scummo
[2:21:13] <dukenux> "you have HIS face" yeah no
[2:21:14] <thetunnelhomer> Wait is THIS Maddentown?
[2:21:15] <+polothegreatest> he doesnt even notice

[2:21:19] <%I4gotmyname89> but he has is face
[2:21:22] <$RealThiele> O.O
[2:21:24] <Jaysky> Ah yes it's not him

[2:23:10] <morningmoondude> "They were gonna beat me up for all the rape if i let them go, i didn't like that idea."
[2:23:10] <%crazyspartan214> 5000

[2:23:16] <blackjack8182> 100-500
[2:23:16] <+FennecZephyr> The problem was when he started a cukt

[2:24:09] <captain_kirkhammer> @Extrallent She's swron to Shep's command, that counts for a lot
[2:24:10] <%JobbedBone> @Extrallent she made an oath that suspends her code
[2:24:11] <brisk_dacat> The math don’t add up
[2:24:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Extrallent Her code has a special condition so she can work w/ Shep

[2:24:51] <blackjack8182> He killed all the other officers
[2:24:51] <%Eilocke> @BigCoffee planet food is what makes you crazy
[2:24:51] <Ardailec> All of the food on the planet was toxic
[2:24:54] <ingman112> Lol the bottom option is Shepard going “aight bro I see you”
[2:24:55] <tanarath> BUT SHE SHOULD TOTES SHOOT YOU AFTER IF YOU DO THIS
[2:24:55] <James_Quivers> It's been 8 years and you can STILL SEE THE FOOD RESERVES

[2:24:58] <$Solid_Stro> This is some shit right here

[2:25:00] <ScreamLord> "Accident"

[2:25:02] <scarman125> "ACCIDENT
[2:25:05] <olm46> How do you talk about the 'accident' so casually!?!
[2:25:05] <blackjack8182> Jesus
[2:25:06] <+JaseAdrift> "ACCIDENT"
[2:25:07] <+RaveBV> "I was kind to my rapists"

[2:25:10] <Dunmarkh> I murdered him for having morals
[2:25:11] <sgtbloopface> @BigCoffee the planet food decays your neural functions
[2:25:12] <+EmptyMug> How could you do this to Clem!?
[2:25:13] <HeroToxiko> cannibalism is heavily implied here
[2:25:14] <iosephe> Dude is literally saying "I am evil" as loud as he can
[2:25:15] <morningmoondude> This is the FAR CRY dimension
[2:25:15] <tanarath> A LITTLE BASIC
[2:25:16] <DatAsuna> why even call it an accident if you immediately admit it was murder?
[2:25:16] <%bassoontyphoon> But the priiiiiize
[2:25:18] <Dabrikishaw> Just like Jacob said, Ronald got bored and wanted out.

[2:25:29] <%MelBrooksKA> And I get the feeling he wasn't rationing, that's 9 and a half years of unrationed food
[2:25:29] <blackjack8182> He is so evil
[2:25:29] <Jaysky> "Wuht? I didn't do nothing wrong."
[2:25:30] <zerointelligence000> It's so weird how deluded he is

[2:25:40] <ingman112> Again, this guy is totally fine. No neural decay whatsoever
[2:25:40] <peachy996> Did I just see the bottom option as "Tempting"
[2:25:41] <greatspaceadventure> Taylor is literally just missing the twirly mustache and a top hat
[2:25:44] <tattleworm> blowing up the twin towers in da2 was more blunt
[2:25:44] <%RyTYoung> Commander Shepard is driving a train from point a to b, the train is moving an average speed of 120km/ph, how many kilometres did he travel if it took 5 hours? Kappa

[2:29:21] <Profmcstevie> Make sure to get your upgrade
[2:29:26] <aiutare47> Does 2 have reload canceling or is that just 3
[2:29:34] <EasternEagle21> So is Overlord the one time in the game where we see someone do something even more undeniably fucked up than this? Becuase I feel that as far malicious and selfish reasonings go, that this is about as bad as it gets before Overlord.
[2:29:36] <$LightningLynx89> Man those space goggles make his character look like such an asshole
[2:29:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Yung EggMane on the track
[2:29:41] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt can't find it, but star wars frigates seem as large as this ME frigate, and they hold anywhere between 200 to 1000 people.
[2:29:45] <+AmericanSkidd> @peachy996 So this is the power of the Chaos Emeralds
[2:29:50] <%Faustgesicht> @PatStaresAt Don't forget your upgrade

[2:29:51] <willyfreshness> "all the men"
[2:29:53] <$RealThiele> Overlord is the mission worse than this yes
[2:29:54] <greatspaceadventure> #notMyfather
[2:29:56] <%JamesCorck> Pat I like how you don't care about Jacob, but you care enough to Renegade his loyalty mission out of spite XD
[2:30:04] <morningmoondude> BITES THE DUST REQUIEM: Range: All of MADDENPLANET
[2:30:06] <niffinbox> robotnik doing a speedrun sonic would be proud
[2:30:07] <HeroToxiko> he wasted tech on mech guards instead of fixing the simple problem LUL
[2:30:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> @EasternEagle21 This and Overlord are so unbelievably fucked up. Like geez, Joel.
[2:30:14] <+zuzuxiv> LOL
[2:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @EasternEagle21 Overlord at least had a better motive than raping women
[2:30:29] <peachy996> @EasternEagle21 depends on how you view Maelon or the Biotic in Jack's mission.
[2:30:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Running around at the speed of THE CHAOS EMERALDS
[2:30:37] <%Eilocke> i love getting the headshot on those mechs. where they go nuclear

[2:30:47] <$RealThiele> overlord on a meta level is more cringy
[2:30:48] <HeroToxiko> hey that robot was made to fix stuff: "make him defend my sex colony"
[2:30:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> WAIT. I stepped away for food. Is Pat redoing the mission as a renegade now?
[2:30:50] <%Varlinator> I do like how they gave the brainwashed guards unique dialogue
[2:30:55] <the_krypto_knight> Jacob loves calling those slave women toys
[2:31:00] <%DracosMagala> YEEAAHHH! Let's kill Lee PokGengar

[2:31:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> the casual tone of this guy makes it even more disgusting
[2:31:23] <$SGrim> @the_krypto_knight considering how he play FemShep, I'm not surprised.

[2:32:22] <$RealThiele> BLYAT
[2:32:23] <EasternEagle21> @peachy996 I basically see Maelon and that biotic as a traumatized people who saw no other option to deal with their trauma. Like, they weren't happily ruining people life's, just adopting a really careless, "the ends justify the means response." Jackwad here was being a monster just for his own pleasure. Even Overlord isn't that bad.
[2:32:27] <sekihoe> they'll cut his balls

[2:35:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Its like the ignored every opportunity to make him more interesting
[2:35:00] <peachy996> Annnnd back to closed off
[2:35:03] <bakkatohri> People with epilepsy have like, monitors that prevent flickering, right?
[2:35:06] <bakkatohri> Isn't that a thing?
[2:35:12] <peachy996> Jacob goes right back to being Jacob
[2:35:15] <Alzero83> You took his Balls, why do you care about his penis?
[2:35:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Like this would have hit harder if his Dad was really more of a hero
[2:35:17] <+WaywardSera> TO FIND OUT READ THE COMICS
[2:35:18] <SaltyAzteca> AT LEAST HE KNOWS
[2:35:19] <dukenux> yeah no

[2:35:34] <SaltyAzteca> EVERYBODY GETS ONE.
[2:35:35] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:35:35] <BlueLunecy> I like how he says that and them immediately flirts with FShep
[2:35:35] <%peachyprimrose> Pat lmao
[2:35:38] <morningmoondude> MADDENPLANET: Complete
[2:35:39] <$RealThiele> So normandy 2 is roughly the size of the ship jacobs father had
[2:35:42] <%Mattais88> "You should bang my boss"
[2:35:43] <%peachyprimrose> EVERYONE GETS ONE... JUST ONE.
[2:35:44] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[2:35:45] <+SaiyanPlague86> One time only
[2:35:47] <$SGrim> That was nicer than I wanted it to be.
[2:35:47] <+Punchasaur> They should probably patch that flickering holy shit
[2:35:47] <%lucaflowe> Wow pat
[2:35:48] <dukenux> it actually gave me a minor headache, damn
[2:35:50] <%Varlinator> GOODBYE JACOB
[2:35:51] <anAngryHamster> Miranda doesn't deserve any man
[2:35:51] <Broken_Sonex> EVERYBODY GETS ONE
[2:35:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt Send Jacob into the heat vent during the suicide mission
[2:35:54] <$Solid_Stro> The hatred Pat
[2:35:56] <peachy996> Jack grows as a person, Miranda quits Cereberus, Jacob....is Jacob
[2:36:01] <EasternEagle21> Who else would rather we randomly have Jenkins come back to life instead of having Jacob?
[2:36:04] <EasternEagle21> Like, I would
[2:36:11] <%BigCoffee> its nice
[2:36:12] <%valriot> Its the Warp Ammo menu
[2:36:14] <aiutare47> ITS GOOD
[2:36:15] <ioci2112> barrier is super good for vanguards
[2:36:16] <GustauveVIII> samara's the best
[2:36:16] <blackjack8182> Agreed
[2:36:16] <captain_kirkhammer> You get your guys loyalty powers, you didn't know that?
[2:36:18] <%Varlinator> Like Barrier
[2:36:18] <%peachyprimrose> "Oh man, we're gonna be on the Normandy with Commander Pat, I heard he hasn't cashed his in yet"
[2:36:19] <$lotharrio> Only those loyal to you.
[2:36:22] <jorniev> don't let him die if only because of the readynes points in 3
[2:36:22] <EasternEagle21> "Wow Commander, the Geth brought me back to life for no reason."
[2:36:23] <$Futurecity10> Nah you want tungsten ammo from garrus
[2:36:25] <%StaceMcGate> BARRIER IS BACK
[2:36:25] <Dabrikishaw> No, I'd rather keep Jacob over Jenkins
[2:36:25] <tanarath> oh jeez
[2:36:25] <akitanito> is barrier still as OP as me1?
[2:36:29] <%DracosMagala> Barrier???? WutFace
[2:36:30] <%ape_hawk> BARRIER AWAITS
[2:36:31] <%Varlinator> ohnYes
[2:36:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Yeeyeeyee
[2:36:36] <count_bob> Barrier is shit in this game.
[2:36:36] <GustauveVIII> samara gets you Reave which is really damn good
[2:36:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @akitanito lol no
[2:36:37] <%rockcentuar> no
[2:36:39] <%MidnightBurst12> the real game starts here
[2:36:40] <Profmcstevie> THE GAMEPLAY IS NOW PEAK
[2:36:41] <peachy996> Now go take off your Robotnik Goggles
[2:36:41] <+Buzzkill983> I was more of a Reave guy, but to each his own
[2:36:44] <%crazyspartan214> is it me or did Twitch just imploded?
[2:36:45] <TourettesPlays> Does Barrier stack with Shields or replace them????
[2:36:46] <HeroToxiko> @JobbedBone oddly she is a huge farscape reference, black hair, Australian, genetic modifications and all
[2:36:48] <%rockcentuar> its not as good
[2:36:49] <zerointelligence000> And now we can forget about Jacob forever
[2:36:50] <+Punchasaur> Miranda a PAWG
[2:36:53] <EasternEagle21> @Futurecity10 He already has Incendiary Ammo, which has the same effectiveness as Tungsten, if not more so against most enemies.
[2:36:57] <%Varlinator> It is SIGNIFICANTLY nerfed compared to ME1
[2:36:57] <+Faultlined> Look at Mordin he is the peak male body
[2:36:59] <akitanito> shame
[2:37:01] <$RealThiele> iz dokapon
[2:37:11] <+Soliloquy123> That research was always weird because it gives you biotic powers on say, Soldier or Engineer
[2:37:12] <ioci2112> barrier doesn't have an animation, which means it's a huge get out of free card in higher difficulties
[2:37:15] <TourettesPlays> Geth Shield Boost >>>> Barrier
[2:37:21] <%dekkitout> @Punchasaur ... psaCrazyhand For once, someone uses the term correctly
[2:37:21] <%StaceMcGate> YEYEYE
[2:37:21] <Broken_Sonex> @Punchasaur That's how they make em in Australia can confirm
[2:37:21] <+fetrigon> good job paige SeemsGood
[2:37:22] <tanarath> @patstaresat barrier is a lot worse in 2, I'd suggest reave
[2:37:23] <Josef_Stryker> SIDONIS
[2:37:25] <SaltyAzteca> GARRUS TIME?
[2:37:26] <$lumporr> WAS IT ABOUT CALIBRATIONS
[2:37:26] <+WaywardSera> Calibrations complete!
[2:37:28] <%JohnAtDawn> YEAH GAARUS MISSION
[2:37:30] <peachy996> Fire in his piercing eyes
[2:37:31] <%StaceMcGate> Garrus Revenge Time
[2:37:32] <PineapplePlatypus> Goodbye Jacob, we wont talk to you again until the suicide mission. Hope you die.
[2:37:35] <Brandon__Brando> Yes time for the best mission
[2:37:37] <%Varlinator> HE'S DONE WITH THE CALIBRATIONS!
[2:37:39] <%logoth_> Detective Pineapple
[2:37:40] <%ComfortableStranger> anyone else think Kelly is hotter now?
[2:37:41] <+SaiyanPlague86> GARRUS TIME
[2:37:43] <$RealThiele> Jaffa revenge!
[2:37:49] <$Solid_Stro> Goddamnit Kelly!!
[2:37:49] <+fetrigon> GARRUS JUICE KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:37:50] <EasternEagle21> @Futurecity10 He has jack all against shields or barrier, but it'd be a better idea for him to get reave or energy drain if he was concerned about that, since it isn't efficient to learn an ammo power if you already have a good one.
[2:37:51] <murdocismyhero> THE FISH
[2:37:52] <peachy996> Take off the Robotnik Goggles too
[2:37:54] <+Punchasaur> @broken_sonex I need to visit Australia

[2:38:04] <%ape_hawk> why change the outfit of someone youre done with?
[2:38:05] <%JobbedBone> give him the manwhore costume
[2:38:06] <$SGrim> Time to NEVER use him again
[2:38:11] <+RaveBV> Gonna miss those goggles
[2:38:11] <%peachyprimrose> Nooo put on evne more pairs of goggles
[2:38:12] <%valriot> yellow for cowards
[2:38:16] <peachy996> Gotta have that yellow cuz black is good with yellow
[2:38:18] <+WaywardSera> Shinra Trooper Helmet
[2:38:19] <murdocismyhero> It looks like robocop
[2:38:19] <Broken_Sonex> @Punchasaur The air is cool right now, you should
[2:38:20] <tanarath> DO IT
[2:38:20] <mr_sups> rECON hOOD
[2:38:20] <zerointelligence000> Are you doing paragon for everyone but Jacob or is it situational?
[2:38:20] <%hat_under_bread> I like the BJ hole in that one.
[2:38:24] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt so what missions are you hoping to do tonight?
[2:38:25] <anAngryHamster> Overwatch 2 costume
[2:38:27] <%logoth_> No helmet to go with your no hair
[2:38:32] <EasternEagle21> Any helmet that obscures you face may as well not exist for me
[2:38:33] <+TheBitingIrish> The blue screen one looks good for Vanguard
[2:38:35] <$SGrim> @zerointelligence000 And Miranda
[2:38:39] <+Buzzkill983> Got a purty mouth for one of those helmets
[2:38:44] <+Punchasaur> @dekkitout wait really? How do you see people misuse it?
[2:38:45] <+black_pariah> i looked up maddentown and it lead me to the woolie trivia page. he is an interesting dude LUL

[2:40:02] <%maskofmichael> Jocker will get that Compussy
[2:40:04] <%justcallmebobplease> Imagine if Jacob replaced Joker as pilot.
[2:40:08] <%BigCoffee> why is your head tilting left
[2:40:12] <%StaceMcGate> Wonder how awful an Elcor or Hanar prostitute would be
[2:40:13] <sekihoe> he's a jokobor, like those finaquest birbs
[2:40:13] <%justcallmebobplease> Just forced you to have to deal with him constantly.
[2:40:14] <nuane> That Omega blussy got me acting unwise
[2:40:14] <%TheotherKristian> By the way, game on sale on steam
[2:40:16] <$RealThiele> EDI is perfect for him. her robotic precision ensures no broken bones while they bone
[2:40:16] <+JaseAdrift> Welp now you never have to talk to Jakob again
[2:40:17] <James_Quivers> EDUSSY
[2:40:19] <blackjack8182> Max barrier and Charge
[2:40:20] <TourettesPlays> I feel like Joker's line about Jacob's mission is meant to be a response to the Paragon choice only
[2:40:24] <%strakillias> Has he done Kasumi's mission yet?
[2:40:34] <%williamrooster> SHIPUSSY
[2:40:36] <PineapplePlatypus> not yet
[2:40:39] <%StaceMcGate> no kasumi yet
[2:40:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Heavy pistol is mah baby
[2:40:48] <%maskofmichael> COMPUSSY
[2:40:51] <Jigglebounce> hell ye
[2:40:53] <%blutzwavedave> psaBig
[2:40:56] <xhodocto385> very heavy KKona
[2:40:56] <+Punchasaur> @broken_sonex one day I’ll see for me self
[2:41:00] <GustauveVIII> Barrier terrible tho
[2:41:08] <$RealThiele> big barrier, big charge
[2:41:09] <Brandon__Brando> @TourettesPlays ya the game kida breaks down when you go pure renegade
[2:41:09] <EasternEagle21> Makre sure to max out incendiary ammo too
[2:41:14] <%StaceMcGate> Pat mains a tank in MMOs and Shooters
[2:41:14] <%bassoontyphoon> Kasumi’s loyalty mission is easily my favourite in the game
[2:41:17] <GustauveVIII> get samara's reave much better
[2:41:20] <Pookiedaexzile> CHARGE
[2:41:24] <TourettesPlays> Has Pat used Shockwave or Pull at all???
[2:41:34] <Pookiedaexzile> BARRIER
[2:41:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> @bassoontyphoon Gotta love a good heist
[2:41:38] <+Buzzkill983> Kasumi loyalty mission has my fave submachine gun
[2:41:42] <%ape_hawk> heavy
[2:41:42] <+FennecZephyr> Pull is good
[2:41:45] <Dunmarkh> @TourettesPlays he uses shockwave occasionally
[2:41:46] <%Ranryu692> Pat do Kasumi's loyalty mission as soon as you can so you can get the good smg
[2:41:48] <dukenux> wait is this a legendary edition thing?
[2:41:49] <Pookiedaexzile> HEAVY
[2:41:50] <Psyramics> your shield will never last 3 minutes
[2:41:51] <+FennecZephyr> I like shockwave more though
[2:41:52] <+Romuken> 3 freaking minutes
[2:41:53] <peachy996> Heavy seems bttrr
[2:41:54] <Psyramics> its not going to last 1 minute
[2:41:55] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Heavy Barrier is just better
[2:41:55] <+TheBitingIrish> "A few critical seconds"
[2:41:56] <$lumporr> holy shit 3 min????
[2:42:00] <%Monkeyweed21> HEAVY
[2:42:01] <%BigCoffee> your shield will never last
[2:42:03] <$RealThiele> duration yeahhhh
[2:42:03] <dukenux> i dont remember upgrading that fast
[2:42:03] <+WaywardSera> A """"FEW""" seconds
[2:42:05] <tanarath> CHOICES THAT MATTER
[2:42:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Its gonna break faster
[2:42:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a trick
[2:42:10] <ioci2112> heavy, you can keep it up all the time anyway
[2:42:15] <GustauveVIII> reason why barrier garbage is cuz charge will always heal 100%
[2:42:17] <Jigglebounce> will the new outro mentioned in podcast be at the end of this stream?
[2:42:17] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays fuckin not anymore lmao
[2:42:21] <%ape_hawk> you shouldnt
[2:42:21] <%StaceMcGate> they do suck
[2:42:23] <%bassoontyphoon> HEAVY
[2:42:23] <+FennecZephyr> If you want a pull, you can just bring Jakob or Thane
[2:42:25] <thetunnelhomer> And now the game is easy
[2:42:26] <+FennecZephyr> Or Miranda?
[2:42:27] <$lumporr> @TheBitingIrish a few: anywhere between 3 and 120
[2:42:27] <peachy996> those are perk powers
[2:42:29] <+SilverDevilfish> Barrier aka Shit Tech Armor
[2:42:29] <+corgiprimer> The appearance is uncanny
[2:42:30] <Josef_Stryker> Shockwave feels useless in ME3
[2:42:30] <@commanderclaw> Shockwave is important for enemies in cover
[2:42:30] <akitanito> you're probably not in danger if you can keep it up for that long anyway
[2:42:30] <mr_sups> Shockwave so cool tho
[2:42:35] <peachy996> You'll get them back later
[2:42:36] <+corgiprimer> Vanguard is OP build
[2:42:37] <Josef_Stryker> Shockwave is mainly for Husks
[2:42:38] <$SGrim> Your playing Vanguard. The only power that matters is CHARGE
[2:42:39] <$RealThiele> charge is a better pull
[2:42:40] <CrypticMochi> Did cryo suck b/c the lack of enemies it affects?
[2:42:41] <%Mattais88> Shockwave is great for husks. Like bowling
[2:42:45] <Pookiedaexzile> What is cover
[2:42:48] <%ape_hawk> @GustauveVIII barrier is great for when charge is on cooldown, dude
[2:42:50] <Strigiform> cover doesnt matter when you use the ultimate power of walk towards them
[2:42:53] <Profmcstevie> Why shockwave when be relentless barrier man
[2:42:54] <+FennecZephyr> I went with Reave for my bonus power
[2:42:55] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt would recommend cryo over pyro, frozen enemies shatter 100% when charged
[2:42:55] <+robosqueeb> enemies be like shields lol
[2:42:55] <%sunsetdisc0> shockwave is good for when you have a ton of husks coming after you
[2:42:56] <TourettesPlays> Biotics is like a higher difficult thing only since unshielded enemies are actually a threat
[2:42:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Shockwave is incredibly for setting off biotic combos though
[2:42:57] <Psyramics> why would use shockwave on enemies in cover when you could charge them and make them not be in cover anymore
[2:43:00] <akitanito> so he's still shit
[2:43:01] <ioci2112> @GustauveVIII yeah, until you get shot after charging, your barrier goes down and barrier has no activation animation, so it saves your bacon
[2:43:03] <Dabrikishaw> Shockwave anf Pull really aren't important for Vanguard
[2:43:03] <%StaceMcGate> Heavy Risk
[2:43:03] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Pat, sometimes they're at places you can't get to
[2:43:05] <Basch71> charge is just pull but for you against the enemy Kappa
[2:43:06] <+Romuken> dont care, you're stuck in that room forever Jacob
[2:43:06] <peachy996> Of course it won't
[2:43:07] <akitanito> Really?
[2:43:08] <tanarath> Pat's playing normal, it doesn't matter.
[2:43:10] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:43:12] <CrypticMochi> Not when you’re on cooldown
[2:43:14] <cerberusgate2117> I always found it weird that Ronald Taylor's ship had guns with thermal clips LUL LUL LUL
[2:43:15] <peachy996> Cuz nothing effects you for shit.
[2:43:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Other people can do Shockwave
[2:43:18] <+corgiprimer> Oh great it's jacob /snore
[2:43:18] <$Solid_Stro> Damn Pat c4sageLUL
[2:43:20] <%kortin> what's up with that stance Jacob has tho
[2:43:20] <zerointelligence000> "I want to talk about how we should have left you with your dad"
[2:43:20] <$SGrim> Bye forever, boring Kanye
[2:43:23] <peachy996> You are a slab of rock,, Jacob
[2:43:25] <arkv01> s-sure you too
[2:43:26] <blackjack8182> FU Jacob
[2:43:33] <%ape_hawk> you need to calibrate garrus' feelings

[2:43:35] <%BigCoffee> omg jacob does look like Kanye
[2:43:37] <TioXyco> then go!
[2:43:38] <Jaysky> Adios
[2:43:41] <%hat_under_bread> It's like mom telling you to do the dishes right before you do it yourself.
[2:43:41] <%valriot> Bird dong
[2:43:41] <Profmcstevie> Damn space hoe GET OFF MY BACK
[2:43:42] <$LightningLynx89> Jacob's only sin is being boring
[2:43:42] <$Solid_Stro> TALK TO GARRUS NOW
[2:43:43] <$RealThiele> i did your dad a justice
[2:43:46] <+Buzzkill983> Send in the aliens!
[2:43:48] <%Ranryu692> @cerberusgate2117 it's not as weird as the Collectors using the same thermal clips
[2:43:49] <EasternEagle21> Pat you take that back. Kelly is too perfect and wholesome to be called things like that
[2:43:54] <%saiyanblitz> These Calibrations
[2:43:55] <TourettesPlays> "Commander, Garrus was complaining about something when I was sitting on his face earlier, you may want to talk to him"
[2:43:55] <Cybersoul666> YOU BETTER TALK TO GARRUS
[2:43:56] <$SGrim> @BigCoffee that is intentional
[2:43:58] <xhodocto385> BrainSlug bring all the aliens
[2:43:58] <%StaceMcGate> REVEEEENGE
[2:43:59] <%MugenSandan> But Pat have you considered that when you cast shockwave you can shout REPPUKEN
[2:44:01] <cerberusgate2117> Jacob somehow gets worse in 3 especially if you made the mistake of romancing him NotLikeThis
[2:44:07] <Huntercd> Garrus best bro
[2:44:08] <peachy996> No? Wait did we talk to him about Sidonis?

[2:44:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Fade of Faze clan
[2:44:30] <cerberusgate2117> or was it 2?
[2:44:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> I love that outfit for Garrus
[2:44:34] <$LightningLynx89> Fade em!
[2:44:40] <%Monkeyweed21> """""betrayal"""""
[2:44:42] <TourettesPlays> @cerberusgate2117 Miranda literally fucking dies if you romance her in 2 and dump her in 3 lmao
[2:44:46] <+Soliloquy123> Garrus' loyalty mission feels wonderfully, unabashedly scifi noir, down to having a guy named Fade
[2:44:49] <tanarath> Varient armour for garrus is good
[2:44:54] <%williamrooster> face for a face
[2:44:55] <%Mattais88> I love actually being able to see Garrus' scars in this version.
[2:45:03] <%YakumoYomi> Vanguard feels even better in ME3, when you've got Nova to pair with Charge
[2:45:04] <peachy996> That is a really sexy armor on him
[2:45:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> @TourettesPlays Woah for real?
[2:45:05] <+Punchasaur> Shepherd looks like he’s wearing lip gloss
[2:45:06] <BenLanBen> why is your character doing the inception leo stare all the time?

[2:51:27] <Brandon__Brando> his shepherd is so cursed
[2:51:30] <EasternEagle21> @Soliloquy123 It's detestable, but I do love how it fits into the world. The asari are so perfect (by their standards) and have gotten so used to controlling everything that they literally allow random people to just assume the responsibility of judge, jury, and executioner with little oversight and basically expect every other species to be okay with it.
[2:51:31] <medoodoo> @nesbitt22 feels that way.. but they like dry arid areas

[2:59:44] <DSD24> Not enough games let you be in a comfy hoodie
[2:59:50] <$lotharrio> I have what's called an oral allergy. Which I call a bitch allergy. But basically it causes very slight reactions to certain foods. Celery, cherries and green apples specifically. Makes them taste "spicy" and cause light inflamation.
[2:59:51] <+Kaiserzelcor> @EasternEagle21 it's the voice
[2:59:54] <NorthstarOtaku11> @peachyprimrose yes Tali is the good

[3:04:16] <cerberusgate2117> Asari life kinda sucks tbh.
[3:04:20] <DSD24> That was a game
[3:04:22] <EasternEagle21> @MugenSandan So many of them are like, "Wow my SO is either dead of old age or right about to die of old age and I don't know how to deal with it."
[3:04:24] <NorthstarOtaku11> @olm46 oh god lol
[3:04:27] <%Varlinator> Hasn't Courtney Taylor voiced Harley Quinn at some point?
[3:04:27] <Broken_Sonex> @BinaryFireball Yeah it's called MassBUSSY

[3:04:31] <peachy996> This quest is crap too
[3:04:31] <%maskedsongbird> Why does she pronounce it like that? "The Obsahvah"
[3:04:35] <%justnathan18> Jacks tattoos look like a middle schoolers notebook
[3:04:36] <aiutare47> Kinda funny how all this can be skipped
[3:04:44] <dukenux> im the joker, im the smok
[3:04:47] <peyodogo> man liara gets so much better after me1, kinda sad we're branching into talimance
[3:04:47] <DSD24> Does Liara seem less blue than the first game?
[3:04:49] <Virokwet> dlc integration be like that
[3:04:50] <NorthstarOtaku11> Liara like I am the danger lol
[3:04:52] <peachy996> Instead of "The Observer" we could have had Tazzik
[3:04:53] <+corgiprimer> Love how they put Liara behind a DLC in this game. Just EA things
[3:04:54] <%Alopekis> @maskedsongbird Why don't you pronounce it like that?
[3:04:56] <BurdRightsActivist> RACE
[3:04:57] <%Varlinator> You can skip this & just go straight into the DLC
[3:04:57] <Pookiedaexzile> FIRE AND FLESH
[3:04:59] <TourettesPlays> this is SUCH a fucking KOTOR quest lmao
[3:04:59] <%ape_hawk> nah, its an asari

[3:05:20] <DSD24> @bassoontyphoon That's probably it
[3:05:23] <%JoshManVGH> What who are you!
[3:05:26] <TourettesPlays> @Varlinator Lair of the Shadow broker is best done when you've hit Level Cap
[3:05:30] <%StaceMcGate> iirc its her assistant
[3:05:31] <+AmericanSkidd> Yes, how helpful...

[3:05:45] <stantheman_97> kill a batarian just to be sure
[3:05:50] <%kyh9> Time to BULLY liara
[3:05:52] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt be careful not to start lair of the shadow broker because it will skip liara's base game quests
[3:05:52] <thelonechris> Baeb
[3:05:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha made it to space, Remember that you moon expedition earth bound bitches

[3:06:14] <+Romuken> gg
[3:06:15] <aiutare47> If you even suspect a batarian, cap em. Cant be too safe.
[3:06:16] <olm46> Ashley was inadvertently correct about batarians.
[3:06:18] <ioci2112> one thing me3 did better than me2 and me1 is no hacking minigames
[3:06:19] <+AmericanSkidd> you love it
[3:06:21] <%condemned_15> babe babe babe babe
[3:06:21] <%StaceMcGate> Are you Pro-Batarian or Anti-Batarian? @PatStaresAt
[3:06:22] <BurdRightsActivist> WOOOOOOOoooo... ResidentSleeper
[3:06:25] <%maskedsongbird> @Alopekis I just mostly think it's weird because her pronunciation seems to change mid-dialogue. That, and she doesn't sound English or Southern normally. So it just comes across as kinda bizarre.
[3:06:25] <peachy996> This is a pretty forgiving minigame Pat relax
[3:06:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Batarians- Bastard ians
[3:06:37] <Dunmarkh> this minigame is kinda shit
[3:06:39] <+destro_223> kill the batarian...because they're batarians
[3:06:39] <cerberusgate2117> I remember playing the hacking minigames on X-Box 360 and PC before. Much preferred PC
[3:06:45] <%Alopekis> Batarians are the real good guys of Mass Effect.
[3:06:47] <NorthstarOtaku11> batarians have librarians?
[3:06:49] <peachy996> Lol Kill the Batarian
[3:06:49] <akitanito> you foooool
[3:06:51] <slix3431> BAHAHAHA

[3:06:55] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:06:55] <%MidnightBurst12> whoops
[3:06:55] <%maskedsongbird> You'll get to read it later if you want.
[3:06:56] <count_bob> Not yet.
[3:06:59] <+EmptyMug> Don't worry
[3:07:00] <$RealThiele> i was elected to lead, not to read
[3:07:00] <+AmericanSkidd> not yet
[3:07:05] <%JamesCorck> It's OK Pat, the game gives you the option to solve it after you read all 5.
[3:07:06] <cerberusgate2117> Also, that was quite the hand placement LUL
[3:07:10] <Pookiedaexzile> FLESH AND FIRE
[3:07:13] <%NCC1701Dave> Kill Batarian anyway
[3:07:14] <NorthstarOtaku11> batarians are pescatarian?
[3:07:16] <+MrAtheGreat> KILL THE VORCHA! Vorcha scum can never be trusted
[3:07:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah this quest is kinda bullshit
[3:07:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah pat, youre so use to runnign through messages that this has fucked you up lol
[3:07:32] <%dekkitout> What?\
[3:07:32] <$Solid_Stro> How about a Batarian, they’re always bad Kappa
[3:07:35] <$RealThiele> hes not wrong tho
[3:07:35] <%Alopekis> It's probably an Elcor
[3:07:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Hell yeah Vorcha can't be trusted
[3:07:37] <olm46> Vorcha are at least honest about being evil
[3:07:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Schemeing to the stars
[3:07:41] <%dekkitout> Impossibe, it has to be the battarian
[3:07:42] <slix3431> Turns out the Vorcha is a great person
[3:07:45] <thelonechris> Just kill all of them. That will guarantee that the suspect doesn't get away.
[3:07:47] <+destro_223> kill the batarian...just to be sure
[3:07:49] <cerberusgate2117> The real answer is presented on a sliver platter once you read all 5 terminals Kreygasm
[3:07:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Probably a jellyfish
[3:07:51] <%NCC1701Dave> But the batarian and vorcha deserve to die though
[3:07:54] <+SilverDevilfish> Asorry
[3:07:56] <%Alopekis> Vorcha would never scheme.
[3:07:56] <dukenux> racial profiling minigame Kappa
[3:08:02] <+EmptyMug> NO
[3:08:05] <+MrAtheGreat> considering how they treat bataraians in this game that's actually kind of surprising
[3:08:06] <+Punchasaur> Baturian
[3:08:10] <%Alopekis> Leave Batarians alone
[3:08:11] <%NCC1701Dave> Ooooops

[3:08:12] <NorthstarOtaku11> protect a child, cap a vorcha
[3:08:14] <akitanito> but one less batarian
[3:08:15] <aiutare47> Even if you’re wrong, one less
[3:08:18] <stantheman_97> he's probably up to something anyway
[3:08:18] <+MrAtheGreat> Although that Batarian is a slaver sooooooo
[3:08:21] <%dekkitout> The vorcha are a simple, misunderstood folk
[3:08:22] <+AmericanSkidd> wtf was her plan with giving her the information
[3:08:23] <peachy996> Oops you killed the one nice Vorcha in the Milky Way Galaxy
[3:08:25] <%JobbedBone> BUY IT UP

[3:08:52] <%blutzwavedave> I pwn this room, I pwn you
[3:08:56] <%NCC1701Dave> The dialog from that volus is the best

[3:18:05] <peachy996> You better
[3:18:08] <peachy996> Rat
[3:18:09] <brisk_dacat> Space colonizer Shepherd
[3:18:13] <EasternEagle21> So, the best outcome for this is to tell the slaver that no one will but the contract, and that allows you to convince her to free the quarian
[3:18:14] <otakon17> You better stay outta trouble!
[3:18:15] <+AmericanSkidd> she didnt even get a name
[3:18:16] <$RealThiele> no more options and crypto lady
[3:18:16] <+MrAtheGreat> b-but isn't she still a slave?
[3:18:17] <Pookiedaexzile> "We bought a slave.....AND FREED HER buy our product"
[3:18:17] <Jaysky> This is not cyberpunk, everything is polished and clean./
[3:18:18] <%Dakuu75> imagine if going bankrupt irl meanty you had to become a slave. jesus
[3:18:19] <%Varlinator> DON'T BUY THE GME!
[3:18:21] <%toolofparanoia> Bitch better learn not to put it all on AMC
[3:18:23] <akitanito> slavery solved by just call it a good corporate social responsibility to free them
[3:18:24] <%EsotericOdyssey> mass effect has a depressing lack of communism
[3:18:26] <+Punchasaur> Do it for her
[3:18:28] <zerointelligence000> It's paragon omega
[3:18:33] <%mads_valentine> @Pookiedaexzile It's better! They are going to take some of her wages to pay off the early freedom fee!
[3:18:36] <%JoshManVGH> And no quarian working on AI has ever been a media nightmare!
[3:18:38] <%twistedj3ster> one bad day away from Omega
[3:18:38] <sekihoe> invest in crypto, become a slav for earless blue sex fiends
[3:18:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's a wealthy shithole
[3:18:41] <xhodocto385> fake utopia LUL
[3:18:41] <+EmptyMug> There's a terminal near Liara's office
[3:18:43] <brisk_dacat> Until mass 3 when she gets into more trouble
[3:18:43] <%Dakuu75> yeah, she lost all her money in stonks. Put too much into GME and AMC XD
[3:18:45] <%HairballCT> it's literally just omega except without the DARKNESS NO PARENTS
[3:18:46] <peachy996> I'm so tempted to start up ME3 and genocide the Quarian again. Tali can watch
[3:18:49] <$SGrim> @MrAtheGreat Not without the contract. Now she's just a garnished corporate worker.
[3:18:54] <+destro_223> Illium is a shithole. back to Omega we go
[3:18:55] <EasternEagle21> And if you do this, the slaver seems genuinely concerned for the quarian's health and only bought the quarian because she knew the quarian had no other option and thought she would get a worse owner elsewhere
[3:18:56] <%MugenSandan> S-slavery works right hahahaha
[3:18:58] <cerberusgate2117> At least Omega is honest about being a shithole. Illium is way worse to me.
[3:19:01] <%dekkitout> I knew the vorcha could do no wrong- I still suspect the batarian tho
[3:19:02] <dukenux> its Wall Street planet
[3:19:09] <aiutare47> Illium has a way better system than slavery. You can’t mistreated them, you can only give them certain work, and if you break contract Law Enforcement gets up your ass. It sucks but it’s infinitely better than actual slavery.
[3:19:13] <dukenux> whatd you expect
[3:19:16] <$RealThiele> illum is rapture
[3:19:19] <intestinal_bleeding> xorny man

[3:19:21] <$Solid_Stro> Kill that damn Volus sabert14Gun
[3:19:21] <%JoshManVGH> It's Omega with a better public works initiative
[3:19:23] <%Alopekis> Omega and Illium are both shitholes, but in different ways.
[3:19:24] <PineapplePlatypus> blind
[3:19:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha are the secrect heroes of Mass Effect

[3:19:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait
[3:19:34] <%Varlinator> There should a Salarian on Omega you can talk to now too
[3:19:36] <gentlemanlyshows> H A C K E R M A N
[3:19:36] <%42nfl19> what did I just hear?
[3:19:39] <+WaywardSera> They're garnishing her wages. I assume that means she would still be liable for the lien if she decided to quit. Basically the company is just refinancing her debt on terms that may not be up to scrutiny
[3:19:42] <DSD24> There are no male Asari
[3:19:43] <cerberusgate2117> @EasternEagle21 I do like that the broker has a hdden heart of gold.
[3:19:44] <otakon17> @42nfl19 it was a Volus
[3:19:46] <+EmptyMug> Call and you'll see it
[3:19:50] <$Futurecity10> Now call liara
[3:19:50] <peachy996> @SGrim I'm sure th Geth Hoppers have a port somewhere
[3:19:53] <stormhawk9891> At least in Omega they're upfront about wanting to kill you
[3:19:55] <otakon17> @42nfl19 he's looking for suit upgrades to bang an Asari
[3:19:57] <brisk_dacat> Master of unlocking here

[3:22:39] <Psyramics> liara isn't an incest baby
[3:22:39] <Profmcstevie> "I had a blueberry phase don't worrrry about it"
[3:22:41] <otakon17> SHE'S NOT INCEST

[3:22:47] <+Punchasaur> Futa asari Kreygasm
[3:22:49] <$RealThiele> sounds like something an incest baby would say
[3:22:50] <%JoshManVGH> Lets go to the shadow broker!
[3:22:51] <xhodocto385> DansGame what, she i snot
[3:22:52] <$hattrick61> Miranda's like super incest
[3:22:53] <otakon17> XD
[3:22:55] <%Alopekis> Miranda's feelings aren't worth hurting.
[3:22:55] <TioXyco> miranda has feelings?!
[3:22:56] <peachy996> You're just shitting on Liara more
[3:22:56] <GustauveVIII> liara romance feels more satisfying in ME3 than tali's... especially when they give you the photoshop picture :(
[3:22:57] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaWhat
[3:22:58] <$SGrim> @Pookiedaexzile No, it's self-cest
[3:23:00] <peachy996> Which I support!
[3:23:03] <%NCC1701Dave> Mirandas father fucked a tube or something
[3:23:05] <otakon17> @Punchasaur that's already a thing thanks to Rule 34 calm down
[3:23:07] <xhodocto385> feelings? but she is a clone
[3:23:09] <wolverinewaswrong> Does Miranda have a mom or is she a clone?
[3:23:10] <TourettesPlays> @Punchasaur There's actually one of those on Illium
[3:23:11] <aiutare47> Miranda was grown in a lab. She’s a lab rat freak of nature not an incest baby.
[3:23:14] <brisk_dacat> What did Miranda ever do to you
[3:23:15] <%DashXero> There were space banjos playing when Miranda was born...
[3:23:17] <blackjack8182> Self-Cest
[3:23:17] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Punchasaur Futasari
[3:23:21] <%Skelefellah> It's probably fiiiiiiine
[3:23:21] <DSD24> @GustauveVIII They fixed the photoshop picture in this edition
[3:23:23] <+AmericanSkidd> Sex with your clone is just Masturbation Plus
[3:23:26] <xhodocto385> Miranda is a gender bender clone LUL please
[3:23:27] <HeroToxiko> Tell miranda she'll never be erin sun LUL
[3:23:30] <$RealThiele> so if mirandas a lab rat can she swim?
[3:23:31] <zerointelligence000> Miranda is an incest petridish baby
[3:23:33] <%crazyspartan214> that would explain why Liara an Miranda are both futa
[3:23:33] <%Varlinator> Did you buy fish?
[3:23:37] <Pookiedaexzile> She's a direct clone of her father, aka he nutted in himself
[3:23:42] <+Punchasaur> @otakon17 I’m well aware, calm down :)
[3:23:44] <$hattrick61> @gustauveviii they fixed that

[3:24:28] <$SGrim> @Pookiedaexzile She mentions that her X chromosome is an amalgam of several different women, so not quite a clone.
[3:24:28] <%mads_valentine> New fetishes were discovered that day.
[3:24:29] <xhodocto385> what DansGame i remember LUL
[3:24:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> for some reason, I remember really liking Junior as a little kid

[3:24:46] <slix3431> This is that conversation with that friendzoned Turian
[3:24:59] <DSD24> @GustauveVIII Yeah its actually a Picture of Tali without her mask on it looks nice

[3:32:38] <%maskedsongbird> @Varlinator Really? I wonder how it feels to be that incorrect.
[3:32:39] <+WaywardSera> which means Miranda's 32
[3:32:39] <$SGrim> So she's 18?
[3:32:40] <%maskofmichael> So she legal?
[3:32:41] <Jaysky> I'm not a kid SIS

[3:32:55] <otakon17> @ape_hawk she has the same "faults" as Miranda
[3:33:03] <%JohnAtDawn> Jack learning stuff
[3:33:04] <%twistedj3ster> does it count as a threesome if they're the same person

[3:33:16] <$Solid_Stro> Jack “…”
[3:33:17] <HeroToxiko> "you stole a clone who was about to be trained as a weapon from a monster" paragon
[3:33:19] <knight_verse> Personally I would have liked it if they had focused on fixing the jank animations instead of moving the camera so it doesn't fpcus on Miranda's ass, but priorities I guess.
[3:33:21] <Dabrikishaw> Henry Lawson is Ronald + dr. Saleon
[3:33:22] <MarylandJutsu> Lets just make ANOTHER ONE
[3:33:24] <$RealThiele> jack:. . .
[3:33:24] <%Skelefellah> Miranda just rollin' up in her white van to steal the child
[3:33:26] <peachy996> So even though she's a cold cerberus bitch you get to see her vulnerable side. Jacob....is a slab of rock
[3:33:31] <otakon17> @ape_hawk I dunno I think the teeth are kinda cute
[3:33:33] <GustauveVIII> why cant we just make a new third child to replace the second child that the first child kidnapped and keep the third child a secret
[3:33:36] <%dekkitout> @Mattais88 Ugh, stats aren't good enough. Roll a new one
[3:33:36] <+fetrigon> or i guess MGHOW LUL
[3:33:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I'd let Miranda kidnap if me I was underage
[3:33:48] <$Solid_Stro> Jack should just be asleep in the background
[3:33:51] <%Dakuu75> I only JUST NOW saw Pat's Krogan-stream-tweet
[3:33:53] <$RealThiele> shoot everything

[3:34:05] <%bassoontyphoon> @abelincoln_catpuncher gross!
[3:34:06] <HeroToxiko> @GustauveVIII he's a jackass who uses all of the dna samples to make a clone
[3:34:07] <cerberusgate2117> @GustauveVIII I guess Mr. Lawson thought Miranda would steal the 3rd child LUL
[3:34:07] <%Varlinator> ohhhhh absolutely
[3:34:10] <Zalapski> ha ha miranda has no friends
[3:34:10] <TourettesPlays> My Phrather
[3:34:12] <peachy996> This take will age poorly
[3:34:12] <xhodocto385> dad did wrong?
[3:34:12] <knight_verse> ShepPat is going to kidnap ALL of the genetically engineered kids
[3:34:13] <%Skelefellah> Thems betrayal words
[3:34:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Okay so Niket is a traitor
[3:34:21] <tanarath> It'd take a minute of dialogue to make Jack ok with this, otters pathetic
[3:34:23] <otakon17> time for SLAUGHTER!
[3:34:24] <+AmericanSkidd> que IASIP theme
[3:34:26] <brisk_dacat> No way he will betray you
[3:34:31] <otakon17> hi Paige!
[3:34:31] <%Varlinator> ohnYes
[3:34:32] <%ape_hawk> man, so many red flags from that one conversation
[3:34:38] <$hattrick61> HE WOULD NEVER BETRAY ME NEVEREVUH
[3:34:39] <wolverinewaswrong> If Miranda and her sister were made in a lab, aren't they technically synthetic?
[3:34:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Or
[3:34:46] <Broken_Sonex> So.....your sis is the same as you?.....the same ass?
[3:34:49] <NorthstarOtaku11> i remember this mission lol
[3:34:52] <wolverinewaswrong> Human geth basically
[3:34:52] <$RealThiele> first quarian slave trading, now child soldier kidnapping
[3:34:58] <%Skelefellah> HE'S THE GOODEST BOY, NEVER DOES CRIMES.
[3:35:09] <%maskedsongbird> @wolverinewaswrong Oh my god, they're both Replicants. Somebody call Harrison Ford!!!
[3:35:14] <NorthstarOtaku11> she's made of flesh though
[3:35:15] <%buffaloaff> God i forgot how fun vanguard was
[3:35:30] <+MrAtheGreat> Man Vanguard is just the COOLEST
[3:35:30] <xhodocto385> miranda is organosynthetic
[3:35:36] <cerberusgate2117> Vanguard is fun. Especially when we get to ME3
[3:35:36] <otakon17> Indeed, it gets more fun in ME3
[3:35:40] <brisk_dacat> Just doing there job
[3:35:42] <%Skelefellah> Vanguard's a monster
[3:35:50] <NorthstarOtaku11> use da layza!
[3:35:51] <%Skelefellah> Clears rooms like no one's business
[3:35:51] <knight_verse> REAL HWROES DO CRIMES LIKE SHEPPAT
[3:35:51] <otakon17> since you no longer have a base cooldown and can have it refill almost instantly
[3:35:53] <T_Sasquatch> @wolverinewaswrong thats not what synthetic means LUL
[3:35:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Shepard Discovered two powers and that's all he needed
[3:36:00] <%Alopekis> I can't believe those explosive barrels hurt when they explode.
[3:36:03] <%buffaloaff> i fucked up and played soldier for my most recent playthrough...no good
[3:36:18] <+Punchasaur> @t_sasquatch I was about to say lol
[3:36:19] <brisk_dacat> The only thing that exploded in shep face today
[3:36:19] <%maskedsongbird> Vanguard is the creature in the horror movie that everyone gets killed off by...and it's so good!
[3:36:24] <otakon17> *Shepard used Charge on Reaper*
[3:36:25] <peachy996> Soldier in this game is still ok
[3:36:25] <%Skelefellah> Time for some shotgun crimes
[3:36:29] <cerberusgate2117> I do recall bugging out Lair of the Shadow Broker with a Vanguard though LUL
[3:36:31] <peachy996> It's no Manguard
[3:36:31] <MarylandJutsu> is it bad that i love sentinel in ME2 and ME3?
[3:36:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a game about Space Powers, Imma be a Space Paladin
[3:36:38] <MarylandJutsu> ME1's one is uhhh wierd
[3:36:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> @otakon17 And nova so you get the fun mechanic of alternating between sacrificing shields for damage and refilling them with charge
[3:36:47] <wolverinewaswrong> @T_Sasquatch Technically no, but she was synthesized I guess lol
[3:36:52] <cerberusgate2117> I quite like Soldier though. Bullet time is fun. PogChamp
[3:36:56] <%Skelefellah> Boop'd her
[3:36:57] <knight_verse> I find Vanguard to be so boring, you literally have to cheese the ge to actually win, no skills required.
[3:37:02] <%buffaloaff> @peachy996 Yeah, gets a little pointless in 3 though.
[3:37:03] <%MidnightBurst12> bonk
[3:37:08] <%Alopekis> Soldier is fine. You don't get a ton of fun stuff like with some of the other classes, but it's a good class to choose if you kind of just want a more standard shooter experience.
[3:37:11] <peachy996> The only one I don't like is Engineer post ME1 because there's no Geth to make it feel worthwhile
[3:37:19] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[3:37:20] <T_Sasquatch> i played soldier because i disliked vanguard in 1 , plus more gun options
[3:37:24] <otakon17> @knight_verse you can still over extend and get swarmed by too much fire
[3:37:28] <%snow_bush> There's a merc out there to scan Pat
[3:37:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Vanguards don't have to do anything, but can do anyrthing
[3:37:41] <$Solid_Stro> Shepard has the body count of thousands on his hands c4sageLUL
[3:37:44] <wolverinewaswrong> I played Infiltrator since I liked overload in 1 and turning invisible in 2
[3:37:45] <Dunmarkh> sentinel looks cool with the tech armor
[3:37:49] <%Alopekis> I chose Soldier in ME1 just because I like the heavy armor. lol
[3:37:51] <tanarath> B L I N D
[3:37:51] <+Punchasaur> @wolverinewaswrong she was cloned, which is still a biological process
[3:37:57] <cerberusgate2117> @Alopekis I do enjoy reload-cancelling as a Soldier. Especially in multiplayer.
[3:37:59] <%Alopekis> Then I kind of just stuck with it.
[3:38:01] <TrollKing96> Is Soldier the only class that can use assault rifles?
[3:38:07] <otakon17> >killed the first set of enemies so fast the game forgot to spawn the others
[3:38:10] <$SGrim> @Solid_Stro Hundreds of thousands
[3:38:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> Infiltrator is cool in 3 because you can basically ignore weapon weight
[3:38:17] <otakon17> Check your radar
[3:38:23] <$hattrick61> Engi gets unique options in 3s dlc
[3:38:23] <DSD24> @TrollKing96 At the start yes
[3:38:24] <GustauveVIII> you can learn assault rifles on the collector ship if you want
[3:38:26] <cerberusgate2117> @TrollKing96 In ME2, yes. Until you pick up AR training.
[3:38:26] <T_Sasquatch> missed epic loot Kappa
[3:38:28] <+cmdrmobium> This music sounds like the PS1 boot screen
[3:38:31] <+AmericanSkidd> perfect
[3:38:34] <wolverinewaswrong> @Punchasaur True but would have been an interesting topic to tackle in 3 with the whole geth storyline
[3:38:36] <%bassoontyphoon> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:38:36] <Jaysky> In ME1 I was soldier, then I switched to sentinel or engineer, whichever summons turrets in 2
[3:38:47] <Pookiedaexzile> The true mass Effect experiecne
[3:38:48] <otakon17> Engineer
[3:38:49] <knight_verse> @otakon17 Only if you don't know about Barrier and the Geth Shield bonis powers that break the class and basically make you almost invincible
[3:38:50] <Profmcstevie> I'm Commander Shepard and I'm being bested by architecture
[3:38:51] <MarylandJutsu> thats engineer jay

[3:38:58] <PineapplePlatypus> Pat are you really lost?
[3:39:02] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 31st month of my validation subscription paid. Heading back into the office for work has been pretty nice but people have also decided to randomly move IT equipment again and wonder why it stopped working
[3:39:07] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Pat streaming Woolie's gameplay?
[3:39:09] <%Skelefellah> He's tryin' with his Pat eyes
[3:39:13] <Tyonidus> Playing as an OP krogan vangaurd in platinum on ME3 multiplayer are some of my fondest xbox 360 memories
[3:39:17] <Jaysky> Ah ok ok. For some reason I think of both sent and engi
[3:39:19] <T_Sasquatch> paige has infected him
[3:39:22] <cerberusgate2117> Woohoo, Pat did it! LUL
[3:39:29] <+Punchasaur> @monkeyweed21 OOF
[3:39:29] <akitanito> is this why dungeons have become corridors
[3:39:35] <wolverinewaswrong> CHARGE CAN GO THROUGH WALLS?
[3:39:38] <%Alopekis> I hate that they left out the multiplayer. It was actually a lot of fun.
[3:39:43] <DSD24> Miranda is dead
[3:39:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Ayo I wonder what that side of the map smells like
[3:39:49] <ingman112> This sounds like Portal 2 music
[3:39:50] <+Buzzkill983> Jack killed her
[3:39:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[3:39:51] <akitanito> OH NO
[3:39:51] <trueGarnish> LUL
[3:39:52] <%HairballCT> oh no

[3:40:24] <+AmericanSkidd> shep squatting down like "aw whu happun"
[3:40:30] <%toolofparanoia> Ass down ass down
[3:40:31] <+Punchasaur> Her ass is too big a target to miss
[3:40:38] <Jaysky> @MarylandJutsu My brain meshed the two classes together because I was contemplating between the two upon starting 2
[3:40:40] <akitanito> oh wow, she is still greyed out in the icon
[3:40:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> this dude tryna circle strafe shep
[3:40:48] <MarylandJutsu> all good jay
[3:40:53] <MarylandJutsu> i just really love Sentinel
[3:40:58] <+destro_223> she's dead again
[3:40:58] <peachy996> This is a nice preview for ME3 Vanguard
[3:41:01] <tanarath> YEAH
[3:41:05] <GustauveVIII> REAVE MUCH BETTER
[3:41:05] <%ape_hawk> barrier is your safety button
[3:41:10] <cerberusgate2117> Double barrier boosts from power and Charge
[3:41:14] <MarylandJutsu> lol normally Miranda would say something
[3:41:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're really killin em Pat
[3:41:16] <%Ranryu692> Reave is so good
[3:41:16] <DSD24> ME3 Vanguard is so fun
[3:41:17] <tanarath> Get Reave or geth shield boost
[3:41:19] <MarylandJutsu> but she CANT
[3:41:20] <$Wafflum> Barrier is still a good failsafe
[3:41:22] <+destro_223> reave is OP
[3:41:23] <otakon17> Reave is just souped up Warp
[3:41:25] <TourettesPlays> Vanguard: I sleep Infiltrator: Real shit????
[3:41:26] <akitanito> oh she revived
[3:41:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Reave heals you
[3:41:28] <%afronooch> my jam
[3:41:28] <Pookiedaexzile> You have options, Reave is great to fill up last
[3:41:29] <+OneGorillionDollars> reave lets you SUCC
[3:41:30] <otakon17> Geth Shield Boost is fantastic
[3:41:31] <%Ranryu692> every class is fun in ME3
[3:41:32] <%DashXero> I had no idea that could happen to party members...
[3:41:32] <%afronooch> SourPls
[3:41:33] <%ape_hawk> suuuuuuure, miranda
[3:41:36] <wolverinewaswrong> yo this music is fire
[3:41:36] <otakon17> dat music
[3:41:36] <T_Sasquatch> also due to how much damage you take in me1 on normal , playing as a charging maniac didnt seem like a good idea LUL
[3:41:37] <%snow_bush> Yes but Reave requires you to make a poor life choice
[3:41:39] <cerberusgate2117> @MarylandJutsu LUL LUL LUL Can't believe she didn't wake up
[3:41:40] <Zalapski> SourPls
[3:41:43] <Jaysky> My renegade was an adept
[3:41:44] <%Varlinator> Oh you don't get the dialogue because she was dead LUL
[3:41:44] <%toolofparanoia> Yeah I elevator music
[3:41:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> Energy Drain is nice because it gives you a power good against shields
[3:41:47] <%Ranryu692> even Soldier is fun considering how many wacky weapons there are
[3:41:47] <+AmericanSkidd> elevator music in the background LUL
[3:41:52] <Frade> gieffff
[3:41:52] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Reave heals you, and does a ton of damage to armor and shields
[3:41:54] <falyden> great music
[3:41:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Reave means you actually took damage, Barrier means you didn't
[3:41:59] <%Skelefellah> Jack's just along for the ride right now
[3:42:00] <otakon17> @Ranryu692 the Revenant is fun
[3:42:02] <MarylandJutsu> Zangief doing CRIMMM
[3:42:03] <falyden> damn it Miranda
[3:42:03] <peachy996> What's everyone's opinion on Dominate?
[3:42:05] <Profmcstevie> Perhaps a dog whistle
[3:42:06] <Jetsfantasy> ShePat looks dead inside
[3:42:08] <+destro_223> Niket is such a sus name
[3:42:12] <godzookylives> Shepard is so dead inside
[3:42:15] <+Buzzkill983> Reave is Samara, Dominate is Morinth.
[3:42:15] <%DianaTheAscian> No says Zangeif
[3:42:23] <cerberusgate2117> @peachy996 I personally feel it's not that good.
[3:42:25] <Jaysky> Soldier is more fun in the later games because of special bullets and shot impacts
[3:42:29] <%Mattais88> @snow_bush Reave is Samara, Morinith give you Dominate I think
[3:42:36] <%Skelefellah> Lookit that red flag right there
[3:42:40] <tanarath> Morinth isn't worth it
[3:42:40] <%Skelefellah> S'right there
[3:42:41] <T_Sasquatch> He would NEVER betray me
[3:42:42] <cerberusgate2117> Reave is better compared to Dominate.
[3:42:49] <peachy996> Now is where Jack gets to exist
[3:42:55] <%watts121> Bruh we gonna get dommed by Morinth?
[3:42:57] <wolverinewaswrong> Who's she?
[3:43:04] <+AmericanSkidd> time for one of the best burns in the game, get some medigel ready
[3:43:06] <MarylandJutsu> SPEAKING OF TRAUMA
[3:43:10] <Pookiedaexzile> My opinion on Dominates is if I wanted a good 3rd person shooter with a bad story I'd play Gears or something
[3:43:11] <wolverinewaswrong> @watts121 Should have been in Citadel
[3:43:11] <+Memequisition> oh did they make niket look younger?
[3:43:14] <Ardailec> Didn't enyala have a ciggarette or something?
[3:43:16] <otakon17> You dun fucked up
[3:43:22] <akitanito> overcompensating
[3:43:22] <DSD24> Why
[3:43:23] <+destro_223> oh look, another crazy Asari Merc leader
[3:43:23] <%Skelefellah> LUL
[3:43:24] <%Alopekis> I think Soldier is good in all games because it's pretty basic. It's one of the classes that really would be hard to screw up.
[3:43:25] <otakon17> DAMN SHE GOT A CLAYMORE
[3:43:25] <gentlemanlyshows> LUL
[3:43:26] <+RaveBV> oof

[3:43:38] <%sunsetdisc0> THAT SHOTGUN SENT HER FLYIN LMAOOO
[3:43:38] <gentlemanlyshows> would've been better if there was a wilhelm scream
[3:43:39] <Jaysky> That should have been the opportunity got you to shoot her
[3:43:40] <%Varlinator> 0 recoil
[3:43:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> Its because she can't see through her visor
[3:43:44] <DSD24> Jack is zoning out
[3:43:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> wtf? how would it launch someone like that
[3:43:46] <peachy996> Jack gives so little of a fuck
[3:43:46] <NorthstarOtaku11> screw this dude

[3:43:49] <$Wafflum> Jack's aiming at the dead lady
[3:43:50] <wolverinewaswrong> Wait baby or 9 year old?
[3:43:53] <%Alopekis> Jack's just doing her own thing.
[3:43:54] <%dekkitout> Jack's prolly indifferent to all this
[3:43:57] <NorthstarOtaku11> peel his muffin cap back blue
[3:43:58] <+AmericanSkidd> jack is just high out of her mind this mission

[3:44:04] <$LightningLynx89> Jack couldn't care less
[3:44:05] <%Skelefellah> Sorry Jack's too concerned about that runaway shot
[3:44:07] <+RaveBV> ...So, are Asari's mostly either crazy leaders or authority zealots?
[3:44:08] <SneakyCorpse> Jack's there to look semi-cool
[3:44:08] <+cmdrmobium> Jack thought she was posing for the box art
[3:44:09] <stantheman_97> she doesn't care
[3:44:09] <%Puhff> WOW
[3:44:10] <HeroToxiko> Just let jack have her Charlies Angels moment
[3:44:11] <cerberusgate2117> When we actually meet Miranda's dad, you have to wonder how stupid Niket has to be to be fooled by such a man.
[3:44:12] <Jaysky> Admittedly Jack could be checking if there's reinforcements
[3:44:19] <%maskedsongbird> Wow, Niket just straight up called out her daddy issues, lol
[3:44:20] <count_bob> Jack is hoping Miranda dies.
[3:44:22] <xhodocto385> niket DansGame
[3:44:31] <Shadope342> Jack aiming at a wall with her 100% opaque glasses

[3:48:08] <%demiiluna> Save and load to be safe?
[3:48:10] <%Mattais88> Same thing happened here too
[3:48:15] <TourettesPlays> Isn't an Insanity playthrough of this game just listening to that heartbeat sound for the entire game?
[3:48:18] <cerberusgate2117> There is a side mission item here somewhere, I think.
[3:48:25] <jorniev> i love that PAT refused to take cover
[3:48:30] <%twistedj3ster> famous last words
[3:48:32] <MarylandJutsu> out of curisoity Pat, do you prefer the heat clijps in this game or the overheating in ME1?
[3:48:37] <%Varlinator> ABS. Always Be Saving
[3:48:38] <Tyonidus> @TourettesPlays that's awful and probably true lmao
[3:48:39] <otakon17> @TourettesPlays basically, helps if you have Geth Shield boost and Tech Armor though
[3:48:41] <aiutare47> Get the amulet
[3:48:42] <peachy996> Insanity on ME2 only fucks you on Horizon in my xperience
[3:48:44] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Behind you
[3:48:45] <cerberusgate2117> Might be near to the elevator.
[3:48:45] <GustauveVIII> insanity is just taking cover and shooting at one guy for 10 seconds and repeating
[3:48:46] <%Alopekis> @TourettesPlays Nah. I didn't really find Insanity to be too difficult until I got to 3.
[3:48:48] <%Varlinator> Trinket
[3:48:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Amulet here pat
[3:48:52] <T_Sasquatch> taking cover as a chadguard is for BITCHES

[3:49:00] <DSD24> Insanity is pretty fun
[3:49:02] <cerberusgate2117> There we are.
[3:49:03] <$Wafflum> @TourettesPlays As someone who just finished the Insanity Vanguard playthrough of ME2, yes. Very yes.

[3:49:30] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Tyonidus Stripper Clips would like a word.
[3:49:33] <DSD24> Miranda is compromised
[3:49:33] <cerberusgate2117> Ass shot goes bye bye.
[3:49:33] <%mads_valentine> @Tyonidus Guns use clips as well. Clips don't have springs to load the bullets.

[3:49:39] <DraxTD> his SPECIAL EYES
[3:49:41] <+RaveBV> to avoid showing her ass, pat
[3:49:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> its so you can see your special eyes
[3:49:42] <olm46> Shephard-cam
[3:49:42] <%demiiluna> probably to hide another ass shot lol

[3:49:52] <Tyonidus> @CatastropheCorvid those are used to load magazines! Wether internal or external!
[3:49:52] <aiutare47> Probably so it isn’t up her ass Pat
[3:49:54] <$LightningLynx89> Miranda isn't being an authentic Aussie, not enough "cunts" being thrown around
[3:49:54] <cerberusgate2117> Shepherd's ass shot that is LUL
[3:49:56] <%ape_hawk> "Miranda, stop cropdusting in the elevator, eww"
[3:50:05] <viewtifulr> put the camera in the ass like they did to ann in persona GOD what the what
[3:50:09] <+MrAtheGreat> It was the only way they could make the shot without having any bit of Miranda’s gigantic ass in it.

[3:50:22] <Tyonidus> Miranda's bottom lip is way too big haha now you all have to see it.

[3:50:24] <%maskedsongbird> Space Australia? Do you think Miranda's friends with Jeice?
[3:50:25] <cerberusgate2117> @LightningLynx89 She needs to throw around some Sheilas as well.

[4:00:35] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Have you ever done the option to do it with Morinth?
[4:00:38] <%MidnightPacif1c> [Mind Break]
[4:00:41] <cerberusgate2117> The Asari applies self-censorship. It's super-effective.
[4:00:41] <BurdRightsActivist> CHOKEJERK IS NOT ENOUGH
[4:00:42] <%maskedsongbird> death by snu snu. Literally.
[4:00:42] <NorthstarOtaku11> samara, you are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of gilf lol
[4:00:43] <%DrTomT18> he feels very guilty and goes on to save people in Mass Effect 3 if you don't kill him
[4:00:44] <wolfen091> bunker down pat, habs just won and are going to the cup finals
[4:00:45] <Broken_Sonex> THE FINAL NUT
[4:00:49] <jorniev> ALL OF THEM ARE HERS
[4:00:49] <+RoByte2> Three huh, how many daughters did you have again Samara?
[4:01:00] <+Punchasaur> She’s such a milph
[4:01:02] <+AmericanSkidd> Samaras story is such a Tragedy
[4:01:03] <T_Sasquatch> I would replace Liara with so many other asari in this game LUL
[4:01:05] <Pookiedaexzile> But what if tho
[4:01:06] <%Bogart4321> im build different though
[4:01:11] <DSD24> Shepard couldn't take it
[4:01:11] <$SGrim> I can take the death nut! *dies nutting*
[4:01:13] <+fetrigon> ONE LAST NUT
[4:01:16] <ioci2112> recruiting morinth makes no sense, she was literally trying to murder you 5 seconds ago, it's stupid even for renegade shepard
[4:01:16] <stote45> the game after would be pretty lame
[4:01:17] <%AncelDeLambert> "How could you imprison the Face Eating Leopard? How could you do that to an innocent Face Eating Leopard?"
[4:01:19] <+SilverDevilfish> You know Samara, after the 2nd kid was a space vampire too you think you'd not have a third
[4:01:24] <peachy996> Saving Morinth sucks in 3. She turns into a Banshee and nobody but the player acknowledges it
[4:01:25] <$Solid_Stro> Samara has the worst luck, never take her to Vegas
[4:01:25] <%dekkitout> So she's a blade runner?
[4:01:26] <+Soliloquy123> "Rip to him but I'm different"
[4:01:30] <cerberusgate2117> Funnily enough, Samara is suppoed to be aware of more Ardat-Yahkshi due to her daughters living in an academy full of them too LUL LUL LUL
[4:01:31] <peachy996> All you get is a namplat
[4:01:34] <%toolofparanoia> Final nut
[4:01:34] <%DrTomT18> renegade Shepard is retarded
[4:01:35] <%Mattais88> Then morinth becomes a miniboss in the last level of me3
[4:01:35] <nuane> "I can take it" Editor's Note: he cannot take it
[4:01:37] <peachy996> *nameplate
[4:01:40] <%MidnightPacif1c> Mind Break, Alien, Snuff
[4:01:41] <%Bogart4321> do you die even if it's just the tip?
[4:01:42] <%ainzhelm> Like Jacob, samara’s stuff is cool, but she’s boring af to be around
[4:01:53] <DSD24> Morinth doesn't want to get better she wants to get worse
[4:01:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Shepard they are literally Xenomorphs.
[4:02:00] <SovPho> Stop right there Asari scum
[4:02:00] <%maskedsongbird> @cerberusgate2117 Yeah, I always thought that ME3 retcon was super weird.

[4:02:20] <+destro_223> Samara is cursed
[4:02:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Morinth is such wasted potentional
[4:02:26] <%DrTomT18> actually there are like 30 of them but who cares
[4:02:28] <jorniev> She has to choose between prison or fucking
[4:02:30] <+Soliloquy123> And you kept going, huh
[4:02:30] <%hat_under_bread> She really decided to try for more huh.
[4:02:30] <nuane> I think wild one is overstating it

[4:03:30] <TourettesPlays> Morinth has a different loyalty power than Samara thats way better, its AI hacking that works on organics
[4:03:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine what Cerberus could do with a Asari that kills people when she fucks, all the stories that person would have of assassinating people, and how fucked up they'd be
[4:03:35] <nuane> use a condom folks
[4:03:37] <%bassoontyphoon> Samara is my second favorite Dommy mommy with vampire daughters

[4:04:17] <%DrTomT18> IT BEGINS
[4:04:17] <%dekkitout> Are there cop cars on fire downtown?
[4:04:24] <leinadtonu> You felt it in the force?
[4:04:26] <Pookiedaexzile> BATTLE
[4:04:27] <%Monkeyweed21> That Blussy does Curse Damage
[4:04:28] <cerberusgate2117> @peachy996 Yeah, I recall doing that for ME2.
[4:04:29] <BurdRightsActivist> LOVECRAFT
[4:04:29] <aiutare47> Lot of honking?
[4:04:31] <stantheman_97> is Montreal about to have a bad time?
[4:04:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> ! BACK AT RISK !
[4:04:35] <RedPlasticCup> DOG BATTLE
[4:04:35] <%king_wragles> @dekkitout Ya, and then the habs won
[4:04:40] <$Solid_Stro> And then were suddenly silenced
[4:04:42] <$RealThiele> paige cannot control his mustard, it is TOO strong
[4:04:46] <biglomix> what percentage of stream is dog related now?
[4:04:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Morinth running away is like an X-Men yelling about how unfair it is for mutant registration to exist. Bitch, you can burn minds from 20 miles away, fuck you.
[4:04:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Morinth shoulda been Jack
[4:05:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> @peachy996 reminds me of save scumming to get blood mage in dragon age without sacrificing that kid
[4:05:12] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp soon, soon I will consume father
[4:05:38] <%Mattais88> Okay foranyone intrested that's the series, so the Habs are going to the finals
[4:05:42] <biglomix> He's already taller than him
[4:05:51] <%DrTomT18> man fuck Liara
[4:05:51] <GustauveVIII> morinth isnt even that special; no continuity except for an easter egg, her bonus power sucks, get special game over
[4:05:52] <%dekkitout> @AncelDeLambert "Look and all I'm saying is that if being gay gave me laser eyes..." -Shammy aka Avery
[4:05:56] <+Soliloquy123> Am I misremembering or doesn't Samara's mission contain zero combat
[4:05:56] <%DrTomT18> seriously
[4:06:09] <NorthstarOtaku11> word
[4:06:16] <ioci2112> samara mission is all dialogue, yes
[4:06:19] <+MrAtheGreat> @Soliloquy123 No you right
[4:06:20] <%DrTomT18> samara has the shortest and easier loyalty mission
[4:06:22] <%bassoontyphoon> Habs just beat the Vegas knights
[4:06:29] <Psyramics> pretty sure its more of an investigative mission
[4:06:41] <$RealThiele> talk no jutsu
[4:06:46] <NorthstarOtaku11> last time i did her mission the game crashed
[4:06:49] <%DrTomT18> with there were more missions like it
[4:06:57] <+MrAtheGreat> On the flip side you lose a pretty serious reward for not being all Para/Rene
[4:07:00] <T_Sasquatch> the hell is a Hab LUL
[4:07:07] <NorthstarOtaku11> throw out the window no jutsu
[4:07:12] <xhodocto385> Morinth is the worst blussy in the Galaxy, no one must be fooled by her jedi mind tricks LUL
[4:07:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @t_sasquatch Hab is my bosses name lol
[4:07:32] <NorthstarOtaku11> not mind tricks
[4:07:34] <ioci2112> the only ally becoming enemy that was done well in me3 was jack, you get a lot of info in the cerberus base before you find her, morinth is literally just an easter egg in priority earth, she's literally the same as every banshee
[4:07:37] <NorthstarOtaku11> blussy tricks
[4:07:45] <tanarath> To be fair to the X-men, I wouldn't trust republicans with an army of giant robots either.
[4:07:51] <NorthstarOtaku11> blowing blue blussy bubbles
[4:07:52] <+MrAtheGreat> @xhodocto385 Will literally eat the souls of whomever dare tread inside
[4:08:04] <%DrTomT18> I like Zieed
[4:08:10] <%DrTomT18> he's a crazy old man
[4:08:14] <peachy996> @ioci2112 agreed
[4:08:52] <T_Sasquatch> Im really not a fan of the way the mass effect series does side missions. They are very clearly important but you never know when they get time gated
[4:09:12] <%DrTomT18> mass effect 2 doesn't do that but 3 does
[4:09:31] <%DrTomT18> that said if you miss the timed missions in 3 what the fuck are you doing
[4:09:35] <T_Sasquatch> i would never have done the academy in me3 because it sounded boring as fuck, i only did it to meet jack again
[4:10:00] <%DrTomT18> the academy is fun. you get to hijack a mech
[4:10:03] <tanarath> 3's time-gated stuff can be counted on one hand m
[4:10:39] <T_Sasquatch> its a good mission but the amount of times hackett would so go to some random area in me2 and me3 got old
[4:10:41] <NorthstarOtaku11> @DrTomT18 that was mad fun
[4:10:46] <T_Sasquatch> so i just didnt care much
[4:10:56] <T_Sasquatch> say*
[4:11:00] <+leo6gm> catJAM
[4:11:04] <%afronooch> @tanarath most side quests in 3 are time gated
[4:11:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Jack is WAY better in 3 than 2
[4:11:16] <%DrTomT18> gotta pump up that war score
[4:11:26] <NorthstarOtaku11> wym time gaited im dumb
[4:11:37] <NorthstarOtaku11> *gated
[4:11:48] <olm46> Means there's a limited time when you can do it
[4:11:55] <T_Sasquatch> certain missions will instantly fail if you dont do them before priority missions
[4:12:07] <%theparisreview> So is pat celebrating the Habs win?
[4:12:12] <%AzureGale> oh no
[4:12:14] <%afronooch> YE 1312

[4:12:19] <Goraka91> monkaS
[4:12:19] <%JoshManVGH> Why?
[4:12:20] <ioci2112> @peachy996 also if you sell legion to cerberus in me2 you find him in the cerberus base, but it's literally just a random geth, shepard doesn't even mention it
[4:12:20] <@commanderclaw> Did they win or lose?
[4:12:21] <%BigCoffee> Yeah they won and are going to the finals
[4:12:22] <%chiluzza> wait is it the annual quebec cop car burning
[4:12:23] <+EmptyMug> It's required

[4:12:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Riots in the streets
[4:12:26] <%dekkitout> Kill who?
[4:12:27] <%DrTomT18> I was very upset that the battle for earth wasn't changed at all in mass effect 3. like I was hoping that if you had a super high war score then things wouldn't be as bad but it's all the same
[4:12:28] <$RealThiele> fireworks go kaboom

[4:12:58] <%moonmintparadise> is it football again ?
[4:12:58] <%barrakuta371> I just ate a sandwich for dinner

[4:12:59] <%condemned_15> monkaS

[4:13:00] <%bassoontyphoon> I live downtown Pat I’m scared they’re shooting fireworks next to my apartment building
[4:13:01] <%NateyBeak> pat also serves paige food while braless

[4:13:06] <arkv01> :O
[4:13:08] <fluffy_sauce> Happy Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day!
[4:13:09] <%Mattais88> Just wait two weeks for the end of the cup for the real riot.
[4:13:14] <+Walopoh> ok George Lucas
[4:13:16] <%DrTomT18> no, baseball
[4:13:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> sports riots are a constant they even happened over hippodrome races in ancient constantinople
[4:13:19] <%DrTomT18> I think
[4:13:21] <%BigCoffee> Pat you're always bra-less
[4:13:23] <T_Sasquatch> that ninja tweet was so random
[4:13:23] <$RealThiele> booba makes the chemicals go wheeee
[4:13:26] <%DrTomT18> nah get the assault rifle par
[4:13:27] <tattleworm> the absolute weapon
[4:13:28] <leinadtonu> To fight the rioters?
[4:13:29] <tattleworm> you want that
[4:13:29] <@commanderclaw> The Claymore is the shit, it's pump action
[4:13:32] <%dekkitout> @Mattais88 So this is the pre riot?
[4:13:32] <%DrTomT18> it's super good for the vanguard
[4:13:34] <+AmericanSkidd> one shot
[4:13:35] <%walternatorz> jesus, what happens if the habs win it all?
[4:13:35] <%ainzhelm> @moonmintparadise That’s more reasonable. It’s 2021 so probably no
[4:13:35] <Psyramics> yeah but thats all you need
[4:13:36] <tanarath> Geth Shotgun is kinda better
[4:13:37] <HeroToxiko> @xerotwo it's not even an acab thing, the sports rioters just want to flip a car and cop cars are the only non human cars around LUL
[4:13:37] <%Monkeyweed21> why do you need Claymores?
[4:13:38] <%Mattais88> Ten shots only
[4:13:39] <DSD24> Or you could get cool Assault Rifles
[4:13:45] <peachy996> It's a tough choice
[4:13:45] <+TheBitingIrish> The Claymore FUCKS
[4:13:51] <+MrAtheGreat> no no no THE shit
[4:13:51] <%NopeBadguy> claymore is fantastic
[4:13:51] <aiutare47> You can reload cancel it though
[4:13:51] <NorthstarOtaku11> stand yo ground!
[4:13:51] <%DrTomT18> Assault Rifle good
[4:13:53] <%afronooch> i always go assault rifle so I can use Mattock
[4:13:54] <tattleworm> it's total overkill on normal but how can you not use a krogan shotgun
[4:13:56] <peachy996> The Mattock is a rally great gun
[4:13:57] <%NopeBadguy> esp for vanguard
[4:13:58] <NeroInfinite> he said it's THE shit pat. LUL
[4:13:59] <@commanderclaw> No no, it's THE shit, IE it's great
[4:13:59] <+Thorlias> he said THE shit
[4:14:00] <Goraka91> We got Legion yet?
[4:14:02] <Psyramics> we're not arguing, we're agreeing that it kicks ass
[4:14:04] <%rockcentuar> trash
[4:14:06] <%SkyfireHero> it hits like a nuclear Truck
[4:14:07] <%NopeBadguy> mattock isn't worth it unless you're a soldier
[4:14:07] <%sunsetdisc0> stick with the geth plasma shotty
[4:14:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Some Say something bad about Pump action shotguns
[4:14:11] <%rockcentuar> get assult rifel
[4:14:15] <+Buzzkill983> I personally do Assault Rifle, but you can't go wrong
[4:14:15] <tanarath> The mattock is fantastic
[4:14:16] <ioci2112> the claymore is great if you can kill in one shot, if you can't... well, it shouldn't be a problem in normal
[4:14:17] <Dabrikishaw> The Claymore is like, the signature Vanguard weapon
[4:14:19] <%tank7013> The claymore is cool and it's description says it would shatter a normal person's arm
[4:14:22] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt its a slow weapon, you have to make ALL your shots count
[4:14:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like getting mattock with vanguard
[4:14:24] <Profmcstevie> three magic letters
[4:14:25] <peachy996> But then the Mattock might not be for you or your Vanguard
[4:14:28] <hairtoday> it's not the strongest main weapon, but it's also a brick made for krogan
[4:14:30] <+Punchasaur> The only reason she brought him a sandwich is because ninja doesn’t know how to slice bread himself
[4:14:32] <NorthstarOtaku11> you better stand yo ground playah pat
[4:14:35] <+MrAtheGreat> The Claymore: Wil Kill a Building and maybe a Reaper too with EVERY SHOT
[4:14:44] <peachy996> Talk to Ass Lady
[4:14:48] <T_Sasquatch> I should go.
[4:14:51] <%Monkeyweed21> get the Qlussy
[4:15:00] <HeroToxiko> he is legit a manchild
[4:15:03] <%ainzhelm> Doesn’t the claymore canonically dislocate the soldier of anyone who isn’t a krogan?
[4:15:08] <%condemned_15> that video is hard to watch
[4:15:09] <tattleworm> unless they patched it for legendary, you can knock a full second off of the claymore reload time by doing a melee
[4:15:09] <%ape_hawk> too bad you wont use miranda anymore
[4:15:11] <%Skelefellah> That femme fatale energy
[4:15:11] <aiutare47> Does anyone know if the biotic charge animation skips the reload in 2 or is that only in 3?
[4:15:12] <T_Sasquatch> what ?
[4:15:12] <SovPho> what's the story with this joke
[4:15:15] <peachy996> Now she's not a PS5 Controller
[4:15:15] <+Walopoh> why slice a sandwich just eat the whole thing
[4:15:16] <iosephe> Does ninja even know how to put ingredients on bread?
[4:15:16] <NorthstarOtaku11> qlussy im done XD
[4:15:16] <%cvp5127> god no
[4:15:18] <%GinAndRoses> ehhhh
[4:15:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Slicing bread for sandwich's can be hard depending on the bread
[4:15:19] <+BIumen> it's a low bar
[4:15:20] <Virokwet> maybe
[4:15:21] <kingraven238> yes
[4:15:22] <stantheman_97> eh
[4:15:22] <tanarath> Mmmmm
[4:15:23] <%Piemono> Yes

[4:15:25] <%tank7013> Actually yes
[4:15:25] <%MelBrooksKA> No
[4:15:26] <%Ranryu692> I think you're more entertaining
[4:15:27] <%ItalianWaifu> thats like the lowest bar it could be
[4:15:27] <%Piemono> Its not hard
[4:15:28] <Hellarussian> jury's out
[4:15:28] <%ape_hawk> its not that youre cooler than him, its that hes lamer than you
[4:15:28] <peachy996> neh
[4:15:29] <+chronopaladin> hey, you're (cooler than) that ninja
[4:15:29] <HeroToxiko> @ainzhelm shebberd is robocop
[4:15:30] <%SkyfireHero> infinitely
[4:15:30] <tanarath> Maybe?
[4:15:31] <%Monkeyweed21> thats a low bar
[4:15:32] <%miguelrod777> neither of you is cool
[4:15:33] <NeroInfinite> Maybe
[4:15:34] <Pookiedaexzile> He's a grown man who calls himself Ninja
[4:15:34] <T_Sasquatch> its really not a hard thing
[4:15:35] <+EmptyMug> More entertaining
[4:15:36] <%Ynkubus_> I mean its not hard
[4:15:36] <Profmcstevie> less with each day
[4:15:38] <%walternatorz> signs point to no.
[4:15:39] <+AmericanSkidd> The Claymore breaks lesser humans arms if they try to fire it
[4:15:45] <NorthstarOtaku11> poppin that qlussy on a thursday
[4:15:46] <%demiiluna> @Punchasaur "I don't get why they don't just make the bread without end pieces." Ninja 2020

[4:20:50] <TourettesPlays> boom boom pat
[4:20:55] <fugly_nick> I prefer explosive
[4:20:58] <%ainzhelm> They don’t use the character specific helmets enough in 2. Not enough space walk missions
[4:21:00] <%maskedsongbird> I like explosive drone. It can still do damage even as it's wearing off.
[4:21:03] <LluthyY> explosive
[4:21:03] <Pookiedaexzile> And they're personalities will have so many different flavors to bounce off each other :)
[4:21:04] <%TheFabledAble> all 3 dmg types
[4:21:04] <tanarath> he snore
[4:21:12] <sarynvong> Explosive all the way, Pat

[4:21:15] <+Buzzkill983> Low difficulty I do Attack Drone, insanity I do explosive
[4:21:15] <NorthstarOtaku11> qlussy and salussy
[4:21:16] <Raztron> @peachy996 The Krogan would be the only species it would make some sense not wearing a full helmet in vacuum
[4:21:17] <%demiiluna> Does mordin have salussy
[4:21:18] <Virokwet> hows paige arguing with dog when snoring is present
[4:21:21] <Raztron> but they do lol
[4:21:21] <hairtoday> does mordin have a slussy?
[4:21:22] <%AncelDeLambert> big boom boom
[4:21:23] <knight_verse> The drone in ME2 sucks ass, it's literally useless.
[4:21:24] <%Skelefellah> The boy sleeps psaDogchamp
[4:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> it's tiiiiiiiiime!
[4:21:33] <+WaywardSera> c l o a c a
[4:21:34] <%SkyfireHero> explosive is a must on higher difficulties

[4:21:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @hairtoday slussy is the best one
[4:21:45] <fugly_nick> How close is Pat to the suicide mission?
[4:21:46] <%condemned_15> the Space Turd
[4:21:47] <+Punchasaur> Mordin has a salenis
[4:21:49] <+AmericanSkidd> pretty sus
[4:21:51] <SovPho> oh no framreate
[4:21:59] <Hellarussian> she said the thing
[4:22:00] <Dunmarkh> ladar?
[4:22:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> @knight_verse Its a utility power, it distracts targets and breaks them out of cover, it can even tie up a scion
[4:22:05] <+Walopoh> THEY SAID THE THING
[4:22:07] <ioci2112> @knight_verse the drone literally takes all the aggro from every enemy, geth primes literally stand in the open trying to shoot it instead of focusing on you
[4:22:08] <%bassoontyphoon> Salussy
[4:22:08] <Broken_Sonex> THE SHIP IS SUSSY
[4:22:09] <peachy996> Suicide Mission is far away

[4:22:22] <%afronooch> laser radar
[4:22:24] <tanarath> @dunmarkh lidar
[4:22:28] <Profmcstevie> I sense....amoogus
[4:22:29] <blakeway> like radar, but lasers
[4:22:32] <aiutare47> Laser instead of radio
[4:22:34] <knight_verse> @ioci2112 Sure, if it last more than 5 seconds.
[4:22:34] <%dekkitout> Shouldn't it be lidar, if it's a laser
[4:22:36] <%bravebravesrobin> Premie is back
[4:22:38] <+Walopoh> Dead Space
[4:22:38] <+Soliloquy123> Lidar (/ˈlaɪdɑːr/, also LIDAR, or LiDAR; sometimes LADAR) is a method for determining ranges (variable distance) by targeting an object with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver.
[4:22:39] <%Monkeyweed21> LADAR MY BALLS
[4:22:42] <HeroToxiko> @Mattais88 Maybe because she was a main character in dragonage, it's kinda weird
[4:22:42] <+Punchasaur> Can’t wait for edi's ROBUSSY
[4:22:53] <%AncelDeLambert> light radar, uses optical bandwidths instead of radio
[4:22:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes you can
[4:22:54] <fugly_nick> ME2 feels so long even though it's not much longer than ME1

[4:33:53] <%miguelrod777> blow their arm off
[4:33:54] <+EmptyMug> Infiltrators get the 50 cal and it's great
[4:33:54] <%maskedsongbird> Shep's just THAT badass
[4:33:55] <aiutare47> If youre going to use the claymore, melee immediately after you hear the "click" during the reload, this will speed up the reload by 50% @PatStaresAt
[4:33:55] <blackjack8182> Super Shooty
[4:33:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> remember ammo power
[4:33:59] <DSD24> Did a kid just die? what was that yell
[4:34:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Shotgun

[4:34:07] <%RyTYoung> But did he ask for this tho? Kappa
[4:34:08] <%toolofparanoia> Mass effect super shotgunner choir
[4:34:12] <ioci2112> it's an lmg basically
[4:34:12] <Phob05> It's REALLY powerful, especially against living things!
[4:34:13] <+Buzzkill983> THE Revenant
[4:34:16] <NeroInfinite> ye
[4:34:16] <+black_pariah> shepard literally built different
[4:34:16] <%dekkitout> Saw as in squad automatic?
[4:34:17] <Goraka91> Oh that gun slaps in 3 multiplayer
[4:34:19] <+chronopaladin> they get the DAKKA DAKKA
[4:34:22] <reasonance> the infiltrator sniper is fucking JUICY
[4:34:22] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It still doesn't outperform the Mattock so it's actually better to take the Widow
[4:34:23] <+AmericanSkidd> Machine Gun Kiss
[4:34:26] <%ainzhelm> Revenant
[4:34:29] <$SGrim> The Revenant HMG is fucking nuts on insanity
[4:34:29] <karl_rex> 10 SHOTS?
[4:34:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> you can melee to reload cancel
[4:34:32] <ScreamLord> And snipers get a 50. CAL
[4:34:39] <xhodocto385> KKona HELL YEA BROTHA
[4:34:39] <BurdRightsActivist> THAT'S GOOD.
[4:34:40] <Profmcstevie> That's gonna send my ribs out but BOY I LOVE FIRING IT
[4:34:42] <+destro_223> reload cancel
[4:34:43] <ShiningAxis> not a whole lot of ammo
[4:34:46] <+WaywardSera> not much getting back up from a Heavy Charge and a blast from the Claymore
[4:34:50] <aiutare47> yeah Melee imediately after the click
[4:34:52] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt if i'm a big mass effect fan, what's a good viewing guide for star trek
[4:34:52] <+Punchasaur> Red bullets PogChamp
[4:34:53] <peachy996> Well th Mattock is a DLC gun
[4:34:57] <peachy996> So of course
[4:35:00] <thetunnelhomer> The only problem with the Claymore is the poor ammo
[4:35:01] <%Skelefellah> Shoot gun good, yes-yes
[4:35:02] <+FennecZephyr> To be fair, the maddol os amazing
[4:35:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> gun shoot good
[4:35:03] <jorniev> i love that the advanced training consisted on shepard picking a gun of the floor
[4:35:08] <fugly_nick> This is a cool visual
[4:35:09] <RedPlasticCup> GUN SHOOT GOOD
[4:35:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> bang bang
[4:35:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> why are you blue
[4:35:10] <%Faustgesicht> Now obliterate some zombie
[4:35:13] <Goraka91> I hope they do bring multiplayer back, being a krogan with a revenant going ham was great
[4:35:14] <xhodocto385> shootgun brother KKona
[4:35:15] <blackjack8182> Mattock is op
[4:35:17] <+MrAtheGreat> FUCKERN EDEEAD
[4:35:18] <Profmcstevie> Heavy Charge breaks their bones, Claymore rends their flesh
[4:35:23] <xhodocto385> WutFace eww the pods
[4:35:24] <%NopeBadguy> "How many?" "Too many." "There's nothing in there." "TOO MANY."
[4:35:26] <$SGrim> @NopeBadguy With Incendiary Ammo, the Revenant does better numbers in mid-to-close-range than the Mattock.
[4:35:26] <+CarrowayFashonti> Whenever Pat starts talking about guns it sounds like he is having a stroke
[4:35:31] <BurdRightsActivist> wW H O O PS
[4:35:42] <peachy996> Being a Salarian with a Piranha was the best
[4:35:50] <aiutare47> Claymore's reload cancel can also be chained with a bit of practice, you can fire it pretty good with a rhythm
[4:35:53] <%MidnightPacif1c> g o o
[4:35:58] <ChungusQuest> Hey Pat, ever see the movie Fire in the Sky?
[4:35:59] <nuane> the eggs in my fridge are an alien reference
[4:36:03] <+Punchasaur> Edi just uhm ackshually'd you
[4:36:04] <xhodocto385> yeah, it's alien horror time
[4:36:05] <ioci2112> I used the mattock in me3 until I got the lancer (talking about broken shit), the mattock just feels really good to use
[4:36:07] <TourettesPlays> Pat every sci fi horror made since 1980 has been an Alien rip off
[4:36:13] <+Buzzkill983> Just leave lol
[4:36:16] <ScreamLord> Too bad there's no way to get the other weapons or training. Would be cool to have everything without a save editor
[4:36:36] <peachy996> multiple playthroughs
[4:36:43] <KingSpunf> So many pods. Pod with the pod!
[4:36:49] <$RealThiele> beeees!
[4:36:51] <HeroToxiko> this is just a scouting ship big hero man
[4:36:53] <%condemned_15> lens flare
[4:36:54] <%dekkitout> "It's time to conquer EARTH!"
[4:36:55] <+Soliloquy123> @ScreamLord I get it though, if you were running Soldier you'd have three godlike weapons at once
[4:36:56] <%maskedsongbird> @TourettesPlays Either Alien or the Thing. Not much inbetween
[4:36:57] <$SGrim> @ScreamLord Just keep doing NG+
[4:37:00] <TourettesPlays> Pat look at Mordin's rarely seen breather mask it's so cool
[4:37:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> woah cool lens flare you got in your ship here
[4:37:04] <xhodocto385> everything scifi horror is now an alien ripoff? LUL
[4:37:06] <Laecerelius> But Earth is where I store all my stuff!!
[4:37:06] <+Totally_Not_Toby> earth? but that's where I am!!!
[4:37:08] <%maskofmichael> But all my stuff is on Earth
[4:37:09] <%barrakuta371> This ship looks way bigger on the inside than the outside
[4:37:13] <nuane> I love how in this massive galaxy with hundreds of planets we still need to save earth
[4:37:13] <%AzureGale> Yeah, Assault Suit Leynos is way better
[4:37:14] <+D00msDayDan> why would tali assume that?
[4:37:15] <nephets_stein> Pat
[4:37:15] <%Ravioli_Ronin> EARF
[4:37:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> fuckin nerd
[4:37:24] <Profmcstevie> You would stare at this monolith of a threat and still beat your chest Shepard
[4:37:30] <xhodocto385> most of sci-fi horrors dont need to be humanoid, it's all eldirtch
[4:37:42] <+leontalon> Exactly how much space would several billion pods take up?
[4:37:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> SUPER earth
[4:37:47] <alwayspronking> LUL
[4:37:48] <%Skelefellah> It's a common alien- invasive trope, ye
[4:37:49] <+WaywardSera> But I live there!
[4:37:50] <DSD24> Welcome to EARTH
[4:37:54] <%miguelrod777> me earth

[4:38:03] <peachy996> But that's where I throw my garbage!
[4:38:10] <%RonaldMcDownload> Earth? That's where I keep ym shit!
[4:38:11] <%Ranryu692> IT'S A TARP
[4:38:20] <%dekkitout> Is there a subversion of that where someone finds out and says "They want to conquer- Ganymede!"
[4:38:26] <nuane> HACKED
[4:38:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love this bit its so stupid
[4:38:27] <%RigmaroleHM> They can't destroy Earth, that's OUR job
[4:38:29] <+MrAtheGreat> TARARRRRRRP
[4:38:29] <%OldOnyx> wouldn't star trek have tons of "super earth" planets
[4:38:30] <$SGrim> @leontalon Each pod is 7X3X3 feet, so that times several billion.
[4:38:31] <KingSpunf> Can't sympathize if youre not from Earth. Sorry, but not from Earth doesnt speak to me as a from Earth man

[4:39:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like the idea of harbinger projecting his hologram just to fuck with joker
[4:39:28] <DSD24> I know you feel this
[4:39:28] <Goraka91> Harbinger is a meme lore, Sovereign was actually scary, if full of shit retroactively
[4:39:30] <iosephe> This gives you blue balls Shepard

[4:56:12] <akitanito> HOW?!
[4:56:12] <Hellarussian> how
[4:56:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Illusive man thought it would be a good idea he was high
[4:56:17] <falyden> TIM sucking himself here
[4:56:18] <%RubberFistFight> @maskedsongbird Tim the Enchanter.
[4:56:19] <%Ravioli_Ronin> There’s no reason he couldn’t have just told him it was a trap
[4:56:19] <Dova573> WHY ELI?
[4:56:22] <DSD24> That's a dumb reason
[4:56:25] <Goatllama> Just stop fuckin lyyyyyin

[4:56:51] <$RealThiele> some of you may die, but it is a sacrifice im willing to make
[4:56:54] <xhodocto385> smoking asshole
[4:56:55] <ChungusQuest> All Illusive Man know how to do is stare at sun, brood, plot schemes, do terrorism, smoke hot cigarette and lie
[4:57:05] <+AmericanSkidd> btw we have a dead reaper lol
[4:57:09] <TourettesPlays> Dude Shepard is totally TIM's bitch till EDI gets unshackled it kind of sucks.
[4:57:13] <GustauveVIII> dammit martin sheen stop it
[4:57:15] <Dabrikishaw> Why make us work for Cerberus when you have then betray us all the time and still be evil?
[4:57:18] <%hat_under_bread> There's no alternatives except for this alternative, Shepherd.
[4:57:19] <$Solid_Stro> Illusive Man smoking that Goood Shit
[4:57:19] <%RubberFistFight> wait i just realised this is fullscreen and Pat doesn't have his usual border. Wha-wha-whaaaat?
[4:57:19] <xhodocto385> EVIL DRINKS COLA
[4:57:20] <akitanito> that liquid is weird
[4:57:21] <Psyramics> recently? we knew that in ME1
[4:57:21] <Goatllama> The alliance has determined that you're a fucking flea man, Shepard
[4:57:23] <peachy996> We saw that rift in ME1
[4:57:25] <ketchuo13> What did Pat pick for the weapon choice?
[4:57:27] <%maskedsongbird> Tim spends all his time staring down a sun. Why is he not blind? I guess his vision is augmented
[4:57:27] <falyden> shouldn't her be smoking with a vape?
[4:57:32] <+Punchasaur> His smoking is making his mouth all gross
[4:57:41] <%dekkitout> Very good, Shep
[4:57:44] <xhodocto385> OLD REAPER WutFace
[4:57:45] <%NopeBadguy> HEY LOOK MORE DARK MATTER PLOT MATERIAL
[4:57:47] <%Dementedpenguin> Shepard....
[4:57:47] <$RealThiele> i mean relativistic speed weapons are pretty much GG
[4:57:48] <+dakarplaugas> WHY NOT FIX THE FUCKING WEAPON
[4:57:49] <%SirGO0SE> GAS jermaGrin
[4:57:50] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[4:57:51] <Goraka91> The mass...effect
[4:57:57] <+dakarplaugas> IT KILLED A REAPER
[4:57:58] <xhodocto385> COLD STARS WutFace TOO
[4:57:58] <TourettesPlays> The weapon that damaged Klendagon is the same one that took out that reaper BTW
[4:57:58] <%RubberFistFight> @maskedsongbird his eyes are Reaper tech.
[4:57:58] <DSD24> Mass Effect time
[4:58:00] <Savage_Howitzer> wubby7 wubby7 wubby7 wubby7 wubby7 wubby7
[4:58:01] <susukouhai> HE SAID THE THING
[4:58:01] <+ClamityArt> Brown dwarf is what we call Pat after a bad taco.
[4:58:09] <%Skelefellah> [He said the title]
[4:58:12] <%Skelefellah> AMAZING
[4:58:21] <Dabrikishaw> The derilect reaper should have been enough proof for the council that reapers exist, but we can't ever tell them
[4:58:22] <%Torus1025> We got ONE
[4:58:22] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> from hell's depths they stabbed at thee
[4:58:22] <+Punchasaur> Brown dwarf? You mean Gary Coleman?
[4:58:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogans
[4:58:30] <jorniev> I still really dig the elusive man more as an uneasy ally instead of a straight-up villain
[4:58:30] <peachy996> And it killed ONE reaper
[4:58:30] <xhodocto385> HEY DansGame we never saw the reaper battle in out old times
[4:58:31] <Ner234> FINAL GUN
[4:58:32] <Pookiedaexzile> It was Krogans
[4:58:36] <%RubberFistFight> @dakarplaugas Do you wanna be the guy that gets up there with a wire bristle brush and a can of WD-40 and scrubs off 37 MILLION YEARS WORTH of rust?
[4:58:36] <karl_rex> Put ALL the stats in to GUN
[4:58:37] <stormhawk9891> Dr Chandanananannana
[4:58:37] <stantheman_97> it fucked up exactly one reaper
[4:58:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't ask me how I know
[4:58:40] <Profmcstevie> One bullet was made, and it's all they could muster
[4:58:40] <Pookiedaexzile> I just do
[4:58:42] <%Monkeyweed21> They killed 1 whole Reaper
[4:58:52] <Hellarussian> why does Shepard continue to trust the untrustworthy guy?
[4:58:57] <$RealThiele> reapers baffled by man with stats only in GUN
[4:58:57] <Pookiedaexzile> I wanna Play as that team
[4:58:59] <%dekkitout> @dakarplaugas psaCrazyhand
[4:59:02] <%Deft_Thought> What if it turns out the Illusive Man smokes clove cigarettes
[4:59:03] <Pookiedaexzile> The Team that got one good hit in
[4:59:06] <MrPandastic> Except you totally did.
[4:59:08] <+RoByte2> "Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space."
[4:59:08] <+ClamityArt> Illusive man more like Illstupid man
[4:59:08] <%Mattais88> Immediatly snitch on him
[4:59:09] <+TheFlyingChurro> @Hellarussian He doesn't
[4:59:12] <Dabrikishaw> @Hellarussian Because the game is forcing him too, that's all
[4:59:14] <%RubberFistFight> IN WHAT WORLD IS THAT NOT SELLING YOU OUT JACOB
[4:59:16] <%RubberFistFight> YOU FUCKING NERD
[4:59:20] <TourettesPlays> @peachy996 Killing the scouts that the reapers leave behind delays their invasion by any number if years apparently
[4:59:22] <$RealThiele> go away jacob
[4:59:23] <%maskedsongbird> @Hellarussian Because the writers of ME2 need an easy source of plot contrivance.
[4:59:27] <%sunsetdisc0> illusive man is smoking candy cigarettes
[4:59:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Illusive man only Smokes Illusive Og
[4:59:34] <Dabrikishaw> @RubberFistFight It's sarcasm man
[4:59:34] <wolverinewaswrong> Wow Morddin took TIMS side
[4:59:34] <Pookiedaexzile> But prerolls
[4:59:36] <fugly_nick> Oh man that Miranda costume looks so much better than her default
[4:59:38] <xhodocto385> N LUL RD JACOBO
[4:59:43] <%HairballCT> how does the illusive man's constant cigarette smoking not light up all the oxygen in his vessel
[4:59:45] <$Solid_Stro> EDI; Bitch please, Shepard
[4:59:52] <peachy996> Right in the hole
[4:59:59] <%Skelefellah> EDI's been smokin' that Collector stuff
[5:00:03] <TourettesPlays> @HairballCT its not a cigarette its a death stick
[5:00:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Illusive Man Vapes
[5:00:07] <Burger_Bonanza> doubting EDI at computer stuff, smh
[5:00:11] <LluthyY> pet the baby!
[5:00:11] <Pookiedaexzile> He's a Dad Vaper
[5:00:11] <peachy996> the right rim of the butt
[5:00:11] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt That gun couldn't of been that good if it the Reaper is still in 1 piece even though it gored a scar that changed the geography of a planet
[5:00:15] <%RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight i don't think jacob's got the mental capacity for that. All he knows is apologia and "muh dad tho"
[5:00:24] <wolverinewaswrong> How does she know what tech they have?
[5:00:35] <wolfen091> squint harder shepard
[5:00:55] <Dabrikishaw> @RubberFistFight Meme away then. I should have known better
[5:00:59] <Broken_Sonex> @wolfen091 It increases his power
[5:00:59] <DSD24> Jacob the king of shit opinions
[5:01:04] <%RubberFistFight> So if you don't have a pass-card the space elevator just dumps you into the black hole.
[5:01:07] <seniormeatbox> reaper IFF triggers the point of no return
[5:01:08] <+Punchasaur> Is Jacob wearing black and yellow… did they pull a mortal kombat
[5:01:10] <peachy996> shut up jacob
[5:01:10] <fugly_nick> I say shut the fuck up Jacob
[5:01:11] <Jaysky> Why wait? Moron.
[5:01:11] <+Buzzkill983> Jacob with the WORST IDEA
[5:01:14] <%Dakuu75> YOLO
[5:01:14] <Goraka91> Yes
[5:01:15] <+AmericanSkidd> you would say that jacob
[5:01:22] <jorniev> WHY IS HE ALWAY SO WRONG I FEEL BAD NOW
[5:01:23] <%Skelefellah> He plays the 'wrong man' in the room
[5:01:23] <%Ranryu692> he was right about his dad
[5:01:24] <wolfen091> so he's pat
[5:01:26] <%Mattais88> Jacob: I'm loyal so fuck the rest, I'll live
[5:01:26] <iosephe> Yeah
[5:01:26] <+dakarplaugas> He dumb
[5:01:27] <+pally_din> Jacob WANTS the crew to die
[5:01:27] <DSD24> Lets rush Shepard
[5:01:27] <ketchuo13> Only good thing he did was give us the armor upgrade for the ship
[5:01:29] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> but pat
[5:01:30] <Jaysky> I say we go in unprepared
[5:01:31] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> THE PRIZE
[5:01:31] <+ClamityArt> Jacob may be the worst squad member in the game.
[5:01:33] <akitanito> It's perfect, it just means you need to do the opposite of everything he says
[5:01:33] <%Monkeyweed21> he was right about his dad
[5:01:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no
[5:01:37] <Zombrocom> Building the team is the objectively correct decision
[5:01:38] <+ClamityArt> Even his romance sucks
[5:01:39] <blackjack8182> Everytime
[5:01:40] <kjb343> JACOB IS ALWAYS WRONG
[5:01:41] <Pookiedaexzile> ....I figured it out
[5:01:43] <%RubberFistFight> Fuckin jacob with the dumbass salute EVERY TIME LUL
[5:01:45] <Broken_Sonex> B L A C K P A T
[5:01:46] <peachy996> He's wrong to suck up to you when you tell him how wrong he is
[5:01:46] <$Solid_Stro> Jacob has Crazy Talk
[5:01:46] <+OneGorillionDollars> Jacob tells you where you need to go, by suggesting you do WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO
[5:01:47] <Shade075> Like sneaking into the captain;s quarters, heavy risk but the priiiiize
[5:01:47] <+TheBitingIrish> He's an idiot, so what?
[5:01:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Jacob is there to make Shepard feel smarter
[5:01:49] <tattleworm> jacob's your worf
[5:01:50] <%RubberFistFight> he's always the only one in the room who does it
[5:01:55] <%RonaldMcDownload> Emlo!
[5:01:57] <akitanito> why did you get renegade
[5:02:02] <+Buzzkill983> It's great his romance leads to him being the only crew member that cheats on Shepherd
[5:02:02] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile THIS
[5:02:02] <%RubberFistFight> big fucken dweebenheimer that he is
[5:02:04] <jorniev> THATS WHAT CRAZY TALK LOOKS FROM THE OUTSIDE
[5:02:07] <%sunsetdisc0> @PatStaresAt i dare you to blow a raspberry on elmo's tumby
[5:02:07] <hairtoday> the reaper iff is such a an important plot detail that never comes up in 3
[5:02:08] <$RealThiele> someone get a blue barrel for jacob
[5:02:11] <brisk_dacat> Cat wants pets
[5:02:14] <seniormeatbox> who's pat banging this playthrough?
[5:02:19] <darkmoonknightess23> renegade is the only way
[5:02:21] <Brofarian> Forgive Jacob, he is an idiot. We purposefully trained him wrong, as a joke.
[5:02:22] <seer0ftime> pet the cat you monster
[5:02:23] <DSD24> Tali
[5:02:24] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaGib
[5:02:34] <wolfen091> everyone
[5:02:38] <%RubberFistFight> @seniormeatbox Liara in ME1 but Tali this time? Also Kelly coz that shit's free.
[5:02:42] <KingSpunf> So, is Subverse any good?
[5:02:45] <DSD24> Friendo
[5:02:45] <ioci2112> it is known that if jacob has a choice between doing the right thing and doing something stupid, he will do something stupid everytime
[5:02:45] <Shade075> Jacob was created as an advanced way for the developers to tell you DO NOT DO THIS
[5:02:46] <$RealThiele> cares about that dick
[5:02:47] <%Ranryu692> FORESHADOWING
[5:02:48] <%dekkitout> Yeah, nakama!
[5:02:48] <akitanito> kelly wants everything

[5:03:06] <+ClamityArt> Kelly is so weird
[5:03:07] <%athuramn> her hand doesn't touch his back
[5:03:07] <Dabrikishaw> Jacob and Miranda are just there to tell the player what their options are. They're acting as a function ort he player, not as characters. I don't see the point in seriously hating anyone over it except for memes.

[5:04:47] <VentWilsn> PURUSSY
[5:04:48] <Broken_Sonex> EAT THE PUSSY OF THIS QUSSY
[5:04:52] <%dekkitout> I thought she IS the Fleet

[5:05:09] <karl_rex> The one Loyalty quest you must go Paragon
[5:05:10] <%Skelefellah> Goodness that seems like a big plot thing
[5:05:12] <%ape_hawk> you know whod make a great witness for your trial? a geth
[5:05:13] <peachy996> Probably not having any thoughts
[5:05:15] <$RealThiele> oh no?
[5:05:16] <%RubberFistFight> @Broken_Sonex Go to mordin for your shots first tho
[5:05:20] <KingSpunf> Triple-lobes alien Qüssy lookin' like a weird orchid... Got me acting real goofey
[5:05:23] <%Dakuu75> that's not so bad. at least it's not jail or death
[5:05:25] <DSD24> Nah you can go Renegade on this mission
[5:05:28] <aiutare47> hope you have enough alignment points for those checks
[5:05:34] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Of course gotta be very carful
[5:05:37] <DSD24> Start yelling at the Admirals like a true Renegade
[5:05:45] <$SGrim> @SGrim Simple, use biotics to reverse the Chirality of the human amino acids and insure the continuation of the bloodline.
[5:05:49] <%Dreath1997> Dreath1997 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Heyya Pat! I'm one of those shadow viewers that only watches vods or hardly ever types. Just wanted to say that I love your content and have been watching since your max payne 2 machinima video! Love you and chat too! psaWink
[5:05:53] <peachy996> Unless ME3 handwaves it away
[5:06:03] <+JonathLP> Terrible, but logical
[5:06:04] <+ClamityArt> Bringing Legion on this mission is some of the best interactions in the game
[5:06:13] <%RubberFistFight> Christ now i'm wondering what she looks like in the qussy area. Thanks chat. Bunch of degenerates.
[5:06:14] <Pookiedaexzile> You don't have to live on one the stank ass ships
[5:06:18] <Pookiedaexzile> if you do a crime
[5:06:22] <DSD24> Damn those Batarians
[5:06:23] <%dekkitout> @SGrim The Redfield procedure is what doctors call it
[5:06:24] <Dunmarkh> wow fuck her
[5:06:24] <Josef_Stryker> Why Batarians?!
[5:06:25] <%Skelefellah> Oop batarians
[5:06:28] <%Skelefellah> There it is
[5:06:31] <%ape_hawk> DAMN BATARIANS
[5:06:38] <+dakarplaugas> why ever trust Batarians
[5:06:41] <Dunmarkh> oh, good job
[5:06:42] <fredahl> fuck you batarians!
[5:06:43] <+Buzzkill983> Fucking Batarians
[5:06:44] <stantheman_97> batarian genocide is justified at this point
[5:06:44] <%zhenthrim213> so a badass
[5:06:44] <%maskedsongbird> More proof that the Batarians are just the worst.
[5:06:46] <%justcallmebobplease> No Good Batarians
[5:06:46] <%Ranryu692> FORESHADOWING
[5:06:49] <peachy996> I'll hope you do
[5:06:49] <%AzureGale> A suicide mission, you say?
[5:07:02] <%AzureGale> SHEPARD, LET ME FINISH
[5:07:04] <fredahl> always up to no goog
[5:07:04] <Shade075> Batarians are cartoonishly always evil
[5:07:05] <+dakarplaugas> they should have been genocided centuries ago
[5:07:07] <%Skelefellah> Goodness I feel some future-predicting forming
[5:07:14] <%dekkitout> We need to get you a litigator, a Vorcha litigator!
[5:07:16] <%ape_hawk> family, family, family
[5:07:19] <+Punchasaur> Just look up some SFMs. It’s not hard to find out
[5:07:20] <wolverinewaswrong> meaning forever
[5:07:21] <$SGrim> @dekkitout ETHAN, LEON, BOTH OF YOU NUT IN CLAIRE. LET THE SPERM COMPETE FOR THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE!
[5:07:21] <$RealThiele> ace attorney shit
[5:07:21] <%Ranryu692> Tali watches Single Female Lawyer, obviously
[5:07:26] <%maskofmichael> a fambily?
[5:07:26] <%RubberFistFight> @ClamityArt There's an interaction in ME3 I fucking love. Legion enters the room and Admiral Raan (Tali's "aunt") just bellows "WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!"
[5:07:28] <$Solid_Stro> Eventually
[5:07:38] <+ClamityArt> Always got time for that Qussy
[5:07:39] <wolverinewaswrong> What a dumb culture
[5:07:44] <wolverinewaswrong> Quarians I mean
[5:07:54] <%dekkitout> @SGrim *Simultaneously: "Why not Carlos? He'd love to?!"
[5:08:00] <%justcallmebobplease> Is Pat still bringing Legion on Tali's hearing mission?
[5:08:03] <$RealThiele> well quarians already proved theya re dumb with the geth
[5:08:06] <%Dakuu75> they keep talking about the fleet. do they not have a planet?
[5:08:07] <%DrTomT18> Shockwave is the best power
[5:08:08] <DSD24> I like Pull
[5:08:09] <Pookiedaexzile> You get better shit later
[5:08:10] <akitanito> why pull when you can charge
[5:08:10] <%Ranryu692> that's because you haven't played 3
[5:08:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Buuuut?
[5:08:14] <Jmann1892> Pull is good
[5:08:14] <TourettesPlays> you NEED warp to make it useful
[5:08:16] <James_Quivers> TUNCHUNKA TIME
[5:08:16] <$LightningLynx89> Pull + Charge is great
[5:08:18] <hairtoday> accurate
[5:08:19] <+pally_din> it has funny physics though
[5:08:19] <Virokwet> fair
[5:08:19] <stormhawk9891> Yeah it's kinda poopoo
[5:08:20] <Ardailec> Pull is generally good for Adepts since they can pop it
[5:08:20] <fugly_nick> Pull is OK
[5:08:21] <karl_rex> You'll like it in 3
[5:08:22] <Burger_Bonanza> Pull is kinda nice for insta-killing husks but otherwise meh
[5:08:23] <+dakarplaugas> it's great
[5:08:23] <%AncelDeLambert> it's okay to be wrong
[5:08:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Its great if you have a sniper
[5:08:24] <+Buzzkill983> Doesn't pull field instantly kill husks? Or am I remembering that wrong?
[5:08:26] <+pre10cious_1> Batman doesn't eat qussy dansnaPirate
[5:08:32] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Pull and Lift are both OP as shit when coupled with explosive or concussive ammo and bottomless pits.
[5:08:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i feel like there are always better options than pull
[5:08:41] <%sunsetdisc0> @Dakuu75 nope. that's like theyre whole thing
[5:08:43] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Is Garrus still calibrating
[5:08:47] <+dakarplaugas> Gets people out of cover and insta kills husks
[5:08:47] <+Saggitori> turussy
[5:08:47] <karl_rex> In 3 pull removes a defense certain enemies have
[5:08:48] <tattleworm> dlc loyalty missions?
[5:08:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Zaeed can get horny for Samara @PatStaresAt
[5:08:53] <$Solid_Stro> Could always talk to Thane
[5:08:53] <%shurtal> Jack
[5:08:59] <%JoshManVGH> Does Warp Ammo trigger explosions on people effected by pull?
[5:08:59] <mesamus> grunt
[5:09:15] <+ClamityArt> Thane is so fucking cool
[5:09:22] <ChungusQuest> Hell yeah Kasumi's mission, that Locust SMG is a monster
[5:09:24] <TourettesPlays> @JoshManVGH not in this game no
[5:09:26] <+dakarplaugas> Jack
[5:09:26] <%BigCoffee> Did you do Kasumi"s special job yet?
[5:09:27] <fugly_nick> Give Thane his sick ass sunglasses back
[5:09:28] <$SGrim> @JoshManVGH in 3, yes.
[5:09:28] <peachy996> Go meet Wrex and end it
[5:09:43] <Pookiedaexzile> GRUNT
[5:09:50] <peachy996> Inferno Grenade is fun
[5:09:51] <+ultimafullmetal> Kasumi's mission gets you the best smg in the game
[5:09:56] <DSD24> Energy Drain is great
[5:09:57] <%RubberFistFight> @Monkeyweed21 And a specific Samara-related character can get horny for Grunt, leading him to say "Go away, Asari slut." It's fucking hilarious.
[5:10:02] <tattleworm> armor piercing ammo's a big damage increase
[5:10:03] <+chronopaladin> COME ON AND SLAM
[5:10:07] <+ClamityArt> Barrier and Reave are by far the best ones.
[5:10:07] <%Ranryu692> pick up an enemy and then slam them into the ground
[5:10:09] <%athuramn> whoa, Miranda's alt looks 👀
[5:10:10] <TourettesPlays> Slam is pull except its harder to detonate
[5:10:12] <%Ranryu692> it's not as good as reave, but it's fun
[5:10:13] <Virokwet> it always was
[5:10:13] <peachy996> Slam is like Ermac in Mortal Kombat
[5:10:13] <stormhawk9891> Warp ammo is also pretty good
[5:10:13] <$SGrim> Slam is a powermove to follow up a charge
[5:10:14] <GustauveVIII> reave is a stun vs organics
[5:10:15] <%DracosMagala> @PatStaresAt How much Paragon you got???
[5:10:16] <tattleworm> reave's the best in 3, but okay in 2
[5:10:17] <Minorou> heck yeah Reave
[5:10:17] <Dunmarkh> reave good
[5:10:20] <%Treuan> I like barrier but yeah Reave ius coool
[5:10:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> Reave is good, Energy drain too
[5:10:23] <+Totally_Not_Toby> warp ammo is the best ammo in the game, it gives you a bugg to damage against every health type except for shield
[5:10:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The big thing about Reave is that it's a single target lifesteal stun
[5:10:28] <+TheBitingIrish> Reave is vicious
[5:10:32] <+ClamityArt> Ya we see it
[5:10:33] <Pookiedaexzile> all of it
[5:10:34] <%DracosMagala> Yes
[5:10:34] <DSD24> You got a ton
[5:10:34] <%athuramn> yeah
[5:10:35] <%king_wragles> We kinda can
[5:10:38] <peachy996> Good for Jack's Mission
[5:10:40] <$hattrick61> wreave is not cool
[5:10:41] <Zombrocom> Slam is the pick up then slam down thing IIRC
[5:10:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Kasumi's loyalty power is stupid good, it'll even stun Harbinger, and the mission is really cool
[5:10:42] <Jaysky> Near full
[5:10:42] <akitanito> big blue
[5:10:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat Goodboy points
[5:10:46] <Profmcstevie> Full blue baby
[5:10:53] <GustauveVIII> Reave heals, stuns armorless/shieldless organics, does damage over time, its the BEST
[5:10:56] <%Monkeyweed21> you need it maxed for Tali and Samara
[5:11:03] <$Solid_Stro> Good Enough SeemsGood
[5:11:06] <%Ranryu692> you should definitely do Kasumi's loyalty mission as soon as it becomes available
[5:11:09] <+ClamityArt> Honestly Reave if you just want something to do tons of damage and Barrier if you're getting killed after teleporting
[5:11:19] <%rockcentuar> Morinth fives domminate
[5:11:20] <+Punchasaur> Come on and slam (the qussy)
[5:11:21] <%athuramn> oh I forgot how cool Kasumis loyalty is
[5:11:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> you don't need it MAXED
[5:11:23] <%Skelefellah> OH BOY
[5:11:24] <Goraka91> monkaS

[5:11:51] <ChungusQuest> Uncanny luck!
[5:11:51] <ioci2112> you don't need it maxed, paragon/renegade checks in me2 is not based in your bar, it's based in how many points you got out of the total that was available to you by that mission
[5:11:53] <+AmericanSkidd> big number go up
[5:11:53] <akitanito> perfect
[5:11:54] <Minorou> too skilled

[5:12:03] <Josef_Stryker> That mod is so good.
[5:12:04] <$hattrick61> ah so that mod got ported quickly
[5:12:09] <$Solid_Stro> That Scanner is hilarious c4sageLUL
[5:12:09] <Dabrikishaw> BTW everyone this is called the skip minigames mod
[5:12:12] <%Skelefellah> Yeah
[5:12:13] <%RubberFistFight> Dude it's the fucking best, you wind up flush with resources and able to buy every fucking upgrade no sweat.
[5:12:14] <Josef_Stryker> Fuck the scanning minigame anyways
[5:12:15] <iosephe> no shit
[5:12:18] <karl_rex> Cheater
[5:12:19] <%Skelefellah> Lookin' like it's freakin' out
[5:12:19] <TourettesPlays> they barely go up the entire game lol
[5:12:22] <Archer336> Shepard depletes the entire universe of resources.
[5:12:22] <seniormeatbox> pat the ammount of shit you have leftover from this affect cerberus in me3
[5:12:23] <Psyramics> why are you even scanning, just buy everything
[5:12:24] <Virokwet> i think thats normal
[5:12:28] <jorniev> WHAT is this mod?
[5:12:28] <$Solid_Stro> Bruh
[5:12:32] <fugly_nick> Does this skip the hacking minigames too?
[5:12:34] <%RubberFistFight> @Dabrikishaw actually i got the "one probe all resources" mod, but it does the same thing.
[5:12:46] <Virokwet> how?
[5:12:46] <%Treuan> that's RAD
[5:12:49] <Josef_Stryker> Does it?
[5:12:51] <tattleworm> you get some extra points for excess mats, yeah
[5:12:52] <TourettesPlays> how fucking so????
[5:12:55] <$Futurecity10> no?
[5:12:57] <%Skelefellah> Huh the more you know
[5:12:57] <Jaysky> How so?
[5:12:58] <Goraka91> Very slightly
[5:12:59] <%miguelrod777> nice
[5:13:00] <%bread_assassin> Isn't there a bug which will penalize you in 3 if you have too much minerals?
[5:13:00] <$Solid_Stro> What?
[5:13:01] <%RubberFistFight> I think you get bonuses, similar to the amount of money you get.
[5:13:03] <%BigCoffee> yeah but its not much
[5:13:07] <willyfreshness> uh oh I did a shit ton of mining
[5:13:08] <%afronooch> you get a little bonus for having a lot
[5:13:09] <%DrTomT18> no but it gives you extra wae score
[5:13:09] <seniormeatbox> they bring in advanced units faster
[5:13:11] <$hattrick61> no it affects the allience, gives you like 5 warscore
[5:13:13] <+AmericanSkidd> we need explination
[5:13:14] <+critikal_bit> Yeah, I think it contributes to your war assets in 3
[5:13:15] <%afronooch> but it glitches if you have too much
[5:13:16] <+Toaderator> im pretty sure if you import more than 999999 resources it bugs out and you dont get the war asset bonus
[5:13:16] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i think you get things for it but i can't remember if it affects cerberus
[5:13:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> that sounds super fake
[5:13:25] <jorniev> woah really!?
[5:13:26] <%Retinolgaming> Yeah its like 5 or 10 warscore.
[5:13:27] <%blutzwavedave> STOP THE SCAN
[5:13:29] <$hattrick61> No
[5:13:31] <Dabrikishaw> @RubberFistFight Ah, I see then.
[5:13:32] <Burger_Bonanza> that sounds fake as fuck lmao
[5:13:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that's hilarious
[5:13:37] <Jaysky> If that's true that's really neat, but I don't remember that ever being a thing
[5:13:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Hell no
[5:13:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> I have NEVER heard that
[5:13:39] <%RubberFistFight> @afronooch really? never happened to me in the first release
[5:13:40] <willyfreshness> I didnt notice Pat had the Sexy Fishnets on again
[5:13:42] <tattleworm> almost certain that's not true
[5:13:43] <fugly_nick> It gives you extra war assets for sure
[5:13:45] <$hattrick61> B I G probably lie

[5:14:14] <%afronooch> @afronooch youre supposed to get 100 war score for having a lot, but it gives 10 if you have over like 250k
[5:14:15] <%toolofparanoia> Who could have for seen this

[5:14:47] <jorniev> fuck you kailang
[5:14:49] <peachy996> You can save them for Legion and Tali adventurs
[5:14:55] <%sunsetdisc0> :0
[5:14:58] <Josef_Stryker> The sidequests are so pointless
[5:14:59] <+ClamityArt> Three is good besides the ending.
[5:15:00] <%maskedsongbird> Oh wow

[5:15:17] <+Totally_Not_Toby> he DOES
[5:15:19] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's so good
[5:15:20] <Virokwet> bonkers but im ready to see this
[5:15:22] <fugly_nick> Remember, do not spoil Citadel for Pat
[5:15:22] <DSD24> Kai leng sucks ass
[5:15:23] <$Solid_Stro> Oh boy, that’s gonna be magical experience sabert14Sip
[5:15:23] <tattleworm> he eats all your cereal
[5:15:25] <%Retinolgaming> 95% of ME3 is great imo.
[5:15:28] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt what, that's even dumber. You fought Cerberus IN THAT VIDEO YOU DID!
[5:15:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Defense force activate
[5:15:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker eh you can get resources, cash and upgrades from them so they're not totally pointless
[5:15:31] <+OneGorillionDollars> LOL I forgot about that
[5:15:35] <+Memequisition> oh this mod makes things so much easier
[5:15:38] <Zombrocom> Oh shit I am excited for ME3 now though
[5:15:40] <Broken_Sonex> Kai Lang is a cuck
[5:15:40] <%Reveresao> RED INTERRUPT EVERYTIME
[5:15:40] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL
[5:15:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Couldn't've timed it better
[5:15:41] <%SwdVengeance> The BIGGEST of jobbers
[5:15:41] <%robotoken> you can also make Garrus ascend to goddhood in ME3
[5:15:42] <blackjack8182> Huge bitch
[5:15:43] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[5:15:44] <Goraka91> Do not mention ME3 stuff, gotcha
[5:15:44] <stantheman_97> i literally remember nothing about kai lang
[5:15:45] <GustauveVIII> they act as if he's your archenemy but he gets literally no characterization outside of LOL I GOT U
[5:15:46] <akitanito> were they too forgettable
[5:15:46] <Minorou> nothing personnel, shepard
[5:15:49] <NeroInfinite> I foregot about Kaileng lol
[5:15:52] <xhodocto385> the sound effect after you probe, the tweeting
[5:15:57] <blackjack8182> Pretty much
[5:15:57] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[5:15:58] <%AzureGale> It was almost a decade ago so no worries
[5:15:59] <%Ranryu692> wait, you actually didn't know you fight cerberus?I thought that was a bit LUL
[5:16:01] <Josef_Stryker> @RubberFistFight They just feel so pointless because there's no ramifications in ME3 for most of them
[5:16:04] <Shade075> He literally sneaks into a guys home and eats their cereal as a power move
[5:16:06] <Boxbunnytheliar> I cannot tell if Kai Leng was made edgy on purpose or if his creator thought he was cool
[5:16:06] <+ClamityArt> Look forward to the Citadel DLC. It's probably the best content in mass effect. It's the best kind of fan service.
[5:16:07] <Pookiedaexzile> ME3 WAS GOOD ACTUALLY SHEPARD
[5:16:12] <%Eilocke> Mass Effect 3 is good in a lot of ways, but the ways in which it's bad are very bizarre. The journal is just objectively worse
[5:16:17] <peachy996> You'll learn of Marauder Shields
[5:16:18] <critiquequartz> He do be sending you scrub quotes tho
[5:16:23] <%ape_hawk> it adds up
[5:16:25] <$hattrick61> THE INDOCTRINATION THEORY SHEPARD
[5:16:27] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt It helps
[5:16:28] <$Solid_Stro> BioWare tried to make Kai Leng like Vergil but failed c4sageYoushalldie
[5:16:29] <+Punchasaur> ME3 is ten years old so whatever
[5:16:31] <+Totally_Not_Toby> experince.... gives you levels yes
[5:16:34] <aiutare47> It can add up
[5:16:34] <$SGrim> Yes
[5:16:34] <%Ranryu692> not all
[5:16:37] <peachy996> Rest In Power Marauder Shields
[5:16:39] <Minorou> ME3 is a good game, it's just that a lot of it is... forgetable
[5:16:40] <ioci2112> a couple of them are not
[5:16:40] <$Futurecity10> some have a bit of story
[5:16:43] <ketchuo13> Most of them
[5:16:43] <%MidnightBurst12> most
[5:16:43] <blackjack8182> Cereberus goes out of its way to sabatoge the war with reapers in 3
[5:16:44] <sgtbloopface> not all no
[5:16:45] <Dabrikishaw> You can level if if those 40 EXP is enough'
[5:16:45] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah it's just go here shoot some dudes leave
[5:16:46] <HeroToxiko> the dark matter storyline was good, me3 was just rushed
[5:16:48] <critiquequartz> Yes
[5:16:48] <+MrAtheGreat> yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
[5:16:48] <$SGrim> Arrive to murder something
[5:16:48] <tattleworm> small scale stuff, mostly fights
[5:16:50] <+AmericanSkidd> some are walk around and press buttons
[5:16:50] <seniormeatbox> one or two are puzzles
[5:16:52] <%Ranryu692> a handful aren't fights, but most are
[5:16:54] <aiutare47> Kinda but also no
[5:16:54] <Dabrikishaw> And yes, all N7 missions are fights
[5:16:57] <peachy996> One is a non-fight
[5:16:58] <+EmptyMug> There's some mini story to some of the m
[5:17:02] <tattleworm> there's a dumb mission where you escort a mech
[5:17:04] <Pookiedaexzile> NO I DIDN"T PLAY THE FIRST 2 SHEPARD , BUT THE GAMEPLAY SHEPARD, whose SAREN SHEPARD
[5:17:04] <%CzeekyTV> CzeekyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! What are you looking forward to most for Endwalker? I'm excited to see more of Eorzea and kick Lahabread's ass some more in the raid series.
[5:17:06] <seniormeatbox> 2 n7 missiojs
[5:17:08] <peachy996> NO DON'T
[5:17:10] <%AzureGale> That's fine
[5:17:11] <akitanito> doesn't seem interesting anyway
[5:17:13] <Jaysky> I am TERRIBLY upset
[5:17:13] <%afronooch> my butthurt is immense
[5:17:14] <%sunsetdisc0> hot take: andromeda wasnt good at time of release, but it didnt cause as much trouble as me3 did with its ending
[5:17:14] <%Ranryu692> there are a few that are
[5:17:15] <tattleworm> and that one where you're walking on a crashed ship
[5:17:15] <+Totally_Not_Toby> they super don't matter
[5:17:15] <Josef_Stryker> I'd say ME3 is a fantastic game right up until those final 10 minutes. Which is where mods like JAM come in.
[5:17:16] <seniormeatbox> 2 n7 missions are puzzles for lore
[5:17:17] <Pookiedaexzile> NO DONT
[5:17:17] <sgtbloopface> theres the cool abandoned ship exploration one, the one with the ship hanging off a cliff
[5:17:18] <fugly_nick> They're not very interesting
[5:17:18] <$Solid_Stro> Nah you good
[5:17:18] <+EmptyMug> That's fine
[5:17:20] <peachy996> It's stuff you can take Legion and Tali on
[5:17:24] <Minorou> it's just fluff
[5:17:25] <LeotheHuntsman> one guy
[5:17:25] <+AmericanSkidd> its fine
[5:17:27] <$Solid_Stro> That’s fine
[5:17:30] <%justcallmebobplease> Wouldn't you be happier to see us butthurt over it? To bask in our salt?
[5:17:34] <+MrAtheGreat> I wouldn't even call ME3 forgettable, it just misses the mark in a few ways, plus it's more or less just more ME2
[5:17:34] <+D00msDayDan> but we want to see you be OP
[5:17:35] <+AmericanSkidd> one guy
[5:17:37] <Jaysky> I don't remember enough
[5:17:38] <Broken_Sonex> One Guy no one cares
[5:17:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> NO DO IT
[5:17:39] <+Toaderator> they dont even import
[5:17:39] <seniormeatbox> the crashed ship one you should do
[5:17:41] <tanarath> Check to see if any of them have story
[5:17:44] <%robotoken> N7 missions are super skippable
[5:17:45] <xhodocto385> BAD ENDINGS Jebaited
[5:17:48] <thehullowed> !uptime
[5:17:48] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 18m.
[5:17:51] <peachy996> Ah well, it's your call
[5:17:51] <%dekkitout> Drop a few saves incase there is anything of note then
[5:17:57] <geosspone> it's a lot of stuff you could totally just do off stream
[5:17:59] <mesamus> pat do the quarian crash before the flotilla, she appears there actually
[5:18:04] <%afronooch> cant take anyone on arrival
[5:18:07] <jorniev> talk about the most interesting ones later
[5:18:08] <BurdRightsActivist> SINGULAR MALE
[5:18:08] <+black_pariah> theres one or two that are cool setpieces but they dont really matter
[5:18:09] <critiquequartz> Do firewalker and overlord on stream
[5:18:10] <peachy996> Yeah ok fine
[5:18:11] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt dont think you take teammates on arrival
[5:18:12] <ScreamLord> Arrival is a Solo mission
[5:18:16] <seniormeatbox> crashed ship has qussy lore
[5:18:16] <%DrTomT18> you can skip the fire walker
[5:18:17] <%Mattais88> Arrival is Sheppard only
[5:18:22] <%DrTomT18> it's totally pointless
[5:18:24] <count_bob> Andromeda was a better game then ME3, honestly.
[5:18:26] <+MrAtheGreat> OH YEAH, I think that's important
[5:18:28] <+ClamityArt> IDK if this counts for DLC quest but if you take Legion on too many quest bad things happen
[5:18:32] <ScreamLord> Let me tell you how insane it is that the Derelict Reaper is still relatively undamaged. The "Great Rift" on the planet Klendegan can be seen from another planet/it's moon and looks like it's the size of a small continent. It's gonna be hundreds of kilometers long and dozens wide. A Reaper is only 2 Kilometers. If any part of that projectile hit it then the Derelict Reaper should have been evaporated from the fabric of reality.
[5:18:33] <peachy996> They're super short anyway
[5:18:35] <fugly_nick> Firewalker is super nothing, you can skip it
[5:18:35] <$hattrick61> Bring legion to the trial
[5:18:35] <%jojo_abob> no bring legion with u on that mission
[5:18:36] <Josef_Stryker> Do u plan to romance Tali? Because if not I suggest holding on to her mission until you get Legion
[5:18:37] <%Faustgesicht> Arrival is best completed after the suicide mission
[5:18:39] <%bravebravesrobin> don't pussy out nere
[5:18:39] <ketchuo13> I usually do Arrival after beating the game
[5:18:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> there is like no dialogue in firewalker
[5:18:42] <stantheman_97> gay
[5:18:44] <+MrAtheGreat> GAY HIMBO

[5:19:11] <%Ranryu692> you don't have to do all the firewalker ones if you don't want to, but you should at least do the first one so that it makes sense when you have the Hammerhead later
[5:19:15] <ChungusQuest> a problem has happen
[5:19:23] <+AmericanSkidd> suffering from success
[5:19:24] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS WHY YOU DO ANOMALIES
[5:19:24] <Josef_Stryker> Do u plan to romance Tali? Because if not I suggest holding on to her Loyalty mission until you get Legion.
[5:19:30] <+ClamityArt> Let's GO
[5:19:33] <peachy996> 95% of these are super short
[5:19:38] <fugly_nick> But why tho
[5:19:43] <leinadtonu> We can't stop him
[5:19:45] <$Solid_Stro> Cool

[5:19:52] <Dunmarkh> why not wussy?
[5:19:53] <+EmptyMug> No Tali!?
[5:19:54] <$SGrim> @Josef_Stryker With perfect execution you can do both
[5:19:56] <%Bane_Kaikyo> S H E P P E R D D
[5:19:56] <Virokwet> off stream grind is inevitable says red orb
[5:19:57] <Dunmarkh> I mean qussy
[5:20:06] <%Mattais88> Even the stuff like melee 100 enemies or Incinate 50 armours?
[5:20:06] <+Totally_Not_Toby> oh yeah, majorly
[5:20:07] <%sunsetdisc0> grunt is shepards handsome shark toad baby boy
[5:20:11] <+AmericanSkidd> plenty
[5:20:12] <seniormeatbox> all the n7 missions combined would be half a stream
[5:20:12] <%Ranryu692> yeah
[5:20:13] <RedPlasticCup> time for puppo
[5:20:14] <Boxbunnytheliar> plus dlc has opportunities to get it too
[5:20:14] <ChungusQuest> VARREN! So adorbable <3
[5:20:15] <%Monkeyweed21> tons
[5:20:16] <+ClamityArt> You will have way more than enough
[5:20:17] <humble_hill_dweller> Da Boys in Town
[5:20:17] <+EmptyMug> Yes
[5:20:17] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt did you seriously just not take Tali on the QUARIAN MISSION!?
[5:20:17] <%Ranryu692> most of the game is loyalty missions anyway
[5:20:20] <Laecerelius> The classic duo, krogan and Garrus
[5:20:21] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah you get a lot in the Loyalty missions iirc
[5:20:29] <+EmptyMug> You can just respec if you need
[5:20:29] <+Totally_Not_Toby> you've got way more than enough time, honestly in a couple of missions you'll have it
[5:20:33] <fugly_nick> Wait, are there quests tied to planet scanning?
[5:20:37] <%athuramn> they start throwing paragon points like candy if I remember correctly
[5:20:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> wait yeah you didn't take tali on the quarian rescue man
[5:20:39] <$Solid_Stro> I maxed paragon and just started being an asshole for the rest of the game c4sageLUL
[5:20:39] <Josef_Stryker> @SGrim Not really unless you plan to let crewmates die
[5:20:52] <peachy996> No
[5:20:52] <+MrAtheGreat> @fugly_nick You better blieve it
[5:20:53] <+ClamityArt> That's good qussy gone to waste
[5:20:54] <%JohnAtDawn> PREDATOR?!
[5:20:58] <+AmericanSkidd> no way
[5:21:03] <count_bob> Quarian mission. No Tali.
[5:21:06] <peachy996> Upgrades aren't on these N7 missions
[5:21:12] <$SGrim> @Josef_Stryker I've done it before with zero causalities.
[5:21:13] <fugly_nick> @fugly_nick That explains why I've never seen this
[5:21:15] <ChungusQuest> Keelah
[5:21:17] <churropoppa> CoronaS
[5:21:19] <Jaysky> When I first played everyone on the ship basically died cause I wanted to do EVERYthing before the final mission
[5:21:20] <+EmptyMug> Also, this is representative of most of the N7 missions, but pretty short
[5:21:21] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt jsyk, unless they changed it, things are affected by the ratio of paragon to renegade points, as well as the total amount you have of each. So just be careful if you max out paragon. Look it up to confirm, but I remember having to keep my renegade low to avoid locking out some stuff on my first playthrough of the OG game.
[5:21:27] <%Ranryu692> @fugly_nick there are mini side quests that you can only find by clicking on the planets. EDI will let you know that she has detected an anomaly even before you open the scanner
[5:21:27] <Jaysky> Then there was post game and it didn't just end.
[5:21:32] <%aWanderingKaivo> just an arena
[5:21:33] <LluthyY> Little Varren Bois

[5:21:54] <Reverend_Godshyne> At least Garrus is having fun
[5:21:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> its just a wildlife murder mission
[5:22:03] <akitanito> pls no
[5:22:04] <LluthyY> Oh god pat LOL
[5:22:04] <Dunmarkh> Hey remember when one of your crewmembers fucked one of these?
[5:22:05] <$Solid_Stro> Hey do you like shooting Varrens?
[5:22:05] <%Torus1025> Garrus is going back to his roots as a cop
[5:22:06] <peachy996> These are so easy and short it couldn't hurt to do these on stream

[5:26:58] <akitanito> a non-response
[5:26:58] <%Dakuu75> what issue?
[5:27:00] <tanarath> Streamer powers!
[5:27:00] <%dekkitout> for a bug feedback post?
[5:27:03] <leinadtonu> They support you. Nice.
[5:27:03] <Pookiedaexzile> He feelin himself
[5:27:04] <peachy996> See you in 8 months
[5:27:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Streamers get support tickets answered
[5:27:16] <%AzureGale> ?
[5:27:17] <%dekkitout> Really, why?
[5:27:18] <iosephe> ah
[5:27:21] <%Dakuu75> why?
[5:27:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's as if you're a streamer or something
[5:27:26] <fugly_nick> That would be way worse than just dealing with the teachables
[5:27:27] <brisk_dacat> Why to zero
[5:27:35] <%Monkeyweed21> why tho
[5:27:38] <NeroInfinite> Why??
[5:27:46] <peachy996> Trying to respec Nemmy?
[5:28:13] <%AzureGale> Oh, min-maxing. Got it
[5:28:13] <HeroToxiko> Min/max time
[5:28:20] <%Monkeyweed21> why
[5:28:28] <NeroInfinite> Oh right min-max
[5:28:40] <fugly_nick> I did have to restart, and having to grind everyone again is way worse than just dealing with all the Teachables
[5:28:46] <%dekkitout> So it becomes ui clutter?
[5:29:04] <%dekkitout> Oh, it dilutes the pool
[5:29:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Same Straw but the cup is too big for the milkshake
[5:29:22] <%RigmaroleHM> Why not just make a new account?
[5:29:26] <+ultimafullmetal> Sounds like their whole system needs changed
[5:29:31] <%Dementedpenguin> DbD grinding has become absurd with every new character introduced.
[5:29:45] <peachy996> tell steve buschelmo to stop snoring
[5:29:46] <%Monkeyweed21> why would you do that to yourself
[5:29:52] <%AzureGale> Yeah that blood web system could use an overhaul
[5:30:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> There should maybe be an option to turn off an amount of perks to prevent that
[5:30:08] <%dekkitout> Guess perk focusing/targeted farming is a feature being looked into
[5:30:18] <seniormeatbox> asides from flashlight shit survivor perks are fucking useless
[5:30:23] <%HairballCT> is that elmo purring or gief snoring
[5:30:42] <seniormeatbox> @hairballct yes
[5:30:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> DEADHARD? what kind of name is that
[5:30:53] <Estuko> @HairballCT it's a bee with a deep voice buzzing
[5:31:04] <+SuperMonk4Ever> Unbreakable is good on Bill.
[5:31:28] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, you gotta unlock a perk three times to get the best version (in most cases)
[5:31:31] <humble_hill_dweller> DEADHARD-MAN
[5:31:40] <fugly_nick> They need to just get rid of the Perk tiers entirely at this point, it's so unnecessary now that there's so many in the game
[5:31:45] <%dekkitout> 255, what a swell number
[5:31:52] <peyodogo> elmos leg
[5:32:11] <+SuperMonk4Ever> 255 and growing!
[5:32:14] <%Dementedpenguin> so it clutters the bloodweb
[5:32:21] <%Dakuu75> I've never heard of a game having a problem like this
[5:32:24] <leinadtonu> I have no idea what any of that means but I hope you get the reset thingy.
[5:32:27] <humble_hill_dweller> Wow, that sucks.
[5:32:40] <%dekkitout> That's a weirdly not-specific specific number, 255
[5:32:46] <Estuko> Its killer because I'm so slow at progressing, I like the game but Im god awful so it takes ages
[5:32:50] <%donell324> Hey Pat the Monster Hunter Stories 2 demo is out
[5:32:55] <lonosis47> Is he gonna debate Jaffe
[5:33:16] <%MrMegaJackpots> is there a list of required perks for optimal play anywhere?
[5:33:27] <+SuperMonk4Ever> It's weird that the mobile game has QOL features that the man game would benefit from
[5:33:39] <~PatStaresAt> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uk0OnioNZgLly_Y9pZ1o0p3qYS9-mpknkv3DlkXAxGA/edit#gid=1886110215

[5:35:40] <GustauveVIII> the demo for death trash is also pretty goddamn good too
[5:35:41] <+SuperMonk4Ever> @Estuko Yeah, I think the bloodweb is more of a store than the random mess it is on the main game. Also bots.
[5:35:41] <L3m0nTwi5t> What the eff is TWEWY?
[5:35:42] <+AgniBrandt> I think both are
[5:35:43] <Estuko> TEWEY sounds like you're saying Twenty in uwu speak

[5:37:37] <%AzureGale> Valkyria Chronicles is XCOM if the only thing XCOM cared about is how fast you completed missions
[5:37:44] <%idyota> idyota subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! did you know; if you romance jacob in me2 you can beat eh shit out of him in the citadel dlc.
[5:37:45] <Estuko> is the story connected?
[5:37:46] <%Monkeyweed21> 1 and 4 are the good ones

[5:38:06] <KeiPrime> yeah the pc port of dead space one is busted
[5:38:06] <GustauveVIII> the story in 1 and 4 is set in the same war with different characters
[5:38:09] <peachy996> I did not want to be reminded how old Dead Space 2 was
[5:38:11] <%blutzwavedave> Yeah I've heard that on PC, unfortunately. I wish EA would do something
[5:38:13] <%StaceMcGate> @Estuko yes but different fronts essentially. 1 is like the defense of France and 4 is the Russian Front
[5:38:22] <%Ranryu692> borrow Woolie's Xbox and use the back compat

[5:38:37] <lonosis47> Xbox series x plays it just fine....__
[5:38:41] <KeiPrime> dead space 2 worked fine but if you wanna play it now you need to like contact EA and get your code reapproved or some shit
[5:38:48] <KeiPrime> at least on pc
[5:38:53] <CptHarlok> Dead Space was done so dirty by EA. They're doing the same shit they always do.
