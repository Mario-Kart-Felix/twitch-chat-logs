[0:25:39] <cellularmishap> cool is temporary, not worth being cool, sonic could've used that info
[0:25:40] <%Chichen> I beat it
[0:25:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's nice, but it's no shawl

[0:25:50] <Dhurkst> @ScreamLord 5 has the most complex gameplay in the series, you have WAY more options than 4
[0:25:52] <%spiritofmojave> we will make Pat cool by pushing money towards him

[0:26:01] <+meatmaaan> would a remake of metal gear rising: revengance be called re-revengance or revengance the rerevengancing MiniK
[0:26:01] <%Jekado> Cheer500 Wouldn't any bad backstory that Pat have be on Angriest Pat not Pat Stares At. Wouldn't Pat Stares At be immune to lame back story since we were there since the beginning?
[0:26:01] <TheFramedWarlock> Hyperlight Drifter is fucking horrible
[0:26:02] <%Ninestempest> not harder than dark souls or some shit
[0:26:03] <+JVolfram> Pat's cool in the same way serial killers are cool
[0:26:04] <ExpressNode> I love it. I beat it too but it was indeed hard
[0:26:05] <%NWR_James> Dance for us you uncool weird douchebag internet psycho clown
[0:26:10] <not_twitter_rowan> Hyperlight Drifter is a moderate challenge

[0:43:36] <missingangle> People told me college would be the highlight of my life and that's a massive fucking lie, too
[0:43:37] <%patriotrenegade> Are we still talking about Darth Vader
[0:43:37] <%Ancopro> my papa
[0:43:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> I had tons of fun in High School. The last 2 years anyway
[0:43:38] <Incrodon> People who liked high school cannot be trusted
[0:43:38] <%Maids4lyfe> FUCK HIGH SCHOOL
[0:43:39] <%Ranryu692> they were trolling you
[0:43:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> parents told me that
[0:43:40] <OkamiDude15> everyone lied to you
[0:43:40] <%GohanHitsugaya> But, what if your body is destroyed now; but wasn't then?
[0:43:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I WAS TOLD THIS
[0:43:42] <Cactuskris> I think you should be happy with yourself
[0:43:42] <%PhysicsLB> I hated high school me
[0:43:43] <GuardMeShielder> I hate how everyone said that.
[0:43:43] <SGrim> People who peaked in High School
[0:43:44] <Dhurkst> High school is dog shit
[0:43:45] <Khorneflakes_> Highschool is overhyped
[0:43:46] <%Zombrocom> It's been a pretty constant stream of suck so far
[0:43:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> middle school was worst
[0:43:48] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> The mother fucking lies
[0:43:48] <Chuckd2041> high school is shit
[0:43:49] <ElenaManetta> everyone got their info from funny sitcoms
[0:43:52] <%Cburg91> I was a dork in high school and still am a dork now!!!!!!
[0:43:56] <%starotter70> Mmmm
[0:43:57] <%BubbaRands> Yeah those teachers were sick
[0:44:03] <%maenos2> while i enjoyed it one thing i do think back to is how my mother described the color of the tiles on the walls of the halls of my high school: prison shower room color.
[0:44:09] <%coreyyotto> High school was fine for me but that's cause i had a really good group of friends and we don't see each other anymore
[0:44:10] <Perky_EDF> How shitty is your life if that was the best?
[0:44:12] <+metalsiren31> I heard that shit too, and high school WAS NOT anywhere close to being the best
[0:44:14] <TonberryLives> Elementary is the shit
[0:44:16] <%maenos2> and damn it, mom was right.
[0:44:18] <%TheWinged7> Oh yeah, high school was the worst time ever, i was clinically depressed from it
[0:44:19] <SleepyMaribo> Highschool sucked, fuck those people who say highschool was awesome.
[0:44:20] <%Ranryu692> they imply it
[0:44:23] <%starotter70> I peaked at birth
[0:44:24] <%Cburg91> Fuck the public school system in US
[0:44:25] <Cactuskris> 3 touchdowns you nerd
[0:44:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Looking back, i should have probably just kicked the shit out of people instead of trusting the administration to do it's job
[0:44:26] <yourliteraldog> Unfortunately it is for alot of people, but fuck those people. I'm glad the factory shut down and there addicted to oxy
[0:44:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> I was a theatre kid around the time they started dominating school, so yeah
[0:44:27] <%Taengoo31> pre school was the best years
[0:44:28] <+oda_flobunaga> Yusuke Uremeshi?
[0:44:28] <DracaenaLeaf> I didn't peak in High school yet I still enjoyed it
[0:44:28] <%Keaton_x> High school is the worst? Idk, my late 20's aren't doing too hot.

[0:44:43] <j0ustar> 50 year old in a varsity jacket says "Man my highschool days were sick"
[0:44:44] <%Roundelay11> I don't think I ever actually peaked
[0:44:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cburg91 *stopped
[0:44:45] <not_twitter_rowan> Highschool was great but that's because I hung out with no one but my friends and didn't get involved in the parties and drama and shit

[0:51:36] <strengthhammer> Bloodbowl 2 is indeed great.
[0:51:38] <%TaterBurglar> Pick the TUTORIAL
[0:51:38] <ManlyMcBeefington> IMO the tree people faction is easy to learn
[0:51:38] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt I donated that before I figured out you were doing the tutorial
[0:51:39] <%mMayrro> just learn as you go 4Head
[0:51:39] <j0ustar> let Pat tutorial first, then true game

[0:52:14] <kazadaz> Pat I recommend you disable the expansions, the bast game is complicated enough
[0:52:14] <%TaterBurglar> Just expose your lack of gamer-knowledge on stream, what's the worst thing that could happen?
[0:52:16] <%Kirby_Sauce> leaving this shit for pazzack
[0:52:17] <yourliteraldog> GW is testament to the idea no matter how fucklng shit your bussiness model is if enough neck beards and perma virgins like your product you will never fail.

[0:54:31] <%bendatron> m.....maybe
[0:54:31] <%PhysicsLB> Why else would we be here?
[0:54:34] <%bevyrage> pat you keep forgetting that elmo is the showbringer and show stopper
[0:54:35] <Dragovus> 24 hour Elmo stream WHEN?
[0:54:37] <$OmegaWeltall> Yes
[0:54:38] <j0ustar> Paige big lie
[0:54:39] <+barrakuta371> it's like 25% for me
[0:54:45] <%cureneckbeard> Put that baby center stage
[0:54:48] <%WhereIsWill> I'm here for the trash fire
[0:54:48] <kazadaz> whenever elmo's not on screen, the other characters should be asking where's elmo
[0:54:50] <+barrakuta371> The Vaulters are so cool
[0:54:50] <Khorneflakes_> That's true... but more = more fun
[0:54:52] <%BubbaRands> move the camera i cant see da babbeh
[0:54:53] <yourliteraldog> Yes the cat and the off chance you have heated gamer moment.
[0:54:53] <Perky_EDF> Hacking is fucking pointless and a pain in the ass
[0:54:57] <kazadaz> also that is good advice pat, turn it all off
[0:54:58] <%coreyyotto> Next time you do a FF14 stream or something you could literally just change the facecam to an Elmo cam and it would only improve the stream
[0:54:58] <%Lewtskie> Show more of cat
[0:54:58] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Main screen under content
[0:55:00] <%BlackMage66652> I like to look at his bag
[0:55:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Program a drone to follow Elmo around and stream its camera all day.
[0:55:07] <%UvBenServed> You could have a 24 hour Emlo stream and people would totally watch
[0:55:17] <boogaleeboo> Hacking was an expansion thing?
[0:55:21] <kazadaz> Becayse they add complexity
[0:55:21] <boogaleeboo> Oh God I fucking hate it
[0:55:22] <Khorneflakes_> It is a lot of features
[0:55:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Learn basics then add those back in
[0:55:26] <laguerrilha> Yeah, add content dlc can really fuck up your games with advanced mehcanics from the go
[0:55:28] <EASrake> Learn the vanilla game first
[0:55:29] <kazadaz> Base game is honestly gine
[0:55:32] <j0ustar> Get good first, then features Pat
[0:55:39] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt For example, Supremecy adds a world kiler shiip that if left unchecked can destroy your capitol
[0:55:42] <Personified134> pat I love your content and always have but every time you spend an hour+ saying you're streaming a game but just sitting and reading donations it makes me want to die
[0:55:47] <IndoorSitup> Just got here, did gameplay started??
[0:56:00] <%king_wragles> Ya, this is the game.
[0:56:02] <SonicD4> @indoorsitup just a flash

[0:56:15] <Suleks> hissho are cool tho....

[0:56:18] <Monkeyweed21> make your own star killer
[0:56:19] <%Jekado> his show?
[0:56:20] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Learn the game and add as needed

[0:56:28] <@SoFarFetched> @Personified134 It's not a pat or paige stream without long donation times LUL
[0:56:29] <axelkaspar> PAT TAKE NOTE OF HOW SEXY THE UI IS
[0:56:30] <Personified134> its a fucking miserable part of the experience
[0:56:30] <Perky_EDF> Most of Endless Space 2's DLCs are kinda crappy
[0:56:30] <Essixian> DO NOT DISABLE THE WEEB BIRDS
[0:56:31] <Daxalog> @PatStaresAt Which species is your favorite? And why is it the Rift Born?

[1:13:32] <Rawklobstah88> @WheatlyXT They changed a couple of UI elements, so no wonder it looks slightly different.
[1:13:33] <huskarl_zap> Xenos should be zero percent population.
[1:13:34] <j0ustar> Dust is everything in this game pretty much when it boils down to it
[1:13:41] <%WheatlyXT> I was hoping for Guilty Gear tho.
[1:13:48] <Rawklobstah88> This is Strive

[1:16:07] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah if people aren't into these types of games, a lot of this will go over your head and may seem boring.
[1:16:07] <Rawklobstah88> So yeah, this looks like Better Stellaris. Can anyone confirm?
[1:16:11] <GoYaK> I've JUST beaten my second playthrough of this...it's good

[1:16:20] <Jack8274> No, when hungry, you just eat baby
[1:16:21] <@SoFarFetched> @valriot 4x type of game
[1:16:23] <Essixian> EVERYONE IN 4X GAMES HAS A FOOD FETISH
[1:16:24] <Parapattern> Just make the most vulnerable members of society into food
[1:16:24] <j0ustar> truth
[1:16:25] <%valriot> Babies are the food monkaS
[1:16:26] <Mr_Strut> I think it's more like you're seeing it level off at the macro scale
[1:16:26] <RollCritFail> He's Learning monkaS
[1:16:29] <%heartlesshealer> in 4x games, wealth hoarding just stopped existing
[1:16:30] <%zyberion626> "Man that was great stea-and I'm pregnant"
[1:16:33] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStareAt is that why Paige is doing all that cooking?
[1:16:33] <knight_of_sorrow> @PatStaresAt to be honest with you pat this game is so complicated I didn't understand how to play it for literal months after I purchased it. So don't feel bad.
[1:16:34] <$thesickestzak> Just have babies to eat them.
[1:16:34] <huskarl_zap> Population "types" lol
[1:16:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Your people are horny gluttons because they eat all the food available and then make babies.
[1:16:47] <%valriot> Sterile Space 2

[1:16:48] <knight_of_sorrow> FACTS
[1:16:49] <knight_of_sorrow> same
[1:16:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLEANESS
[1:16:55] <zamzoph> The same UI in every game
[1:16:58] <$valkuma> 4x is complex?
[1:16:59] <+Remery_> eat all day, fuck all night
[1:17:02] <%fetrigon> TRUE
[1:17:02] <%valriot> Wait, 4X is a genre?
[1:17:02] <$thesickestzak> C L E A N
[1:17:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE ART IS GREAT
[1:17:06] <Monkeyweed21> the Endless games are known for being GODS OF QoL
[1:17:06] <j0ustar> Everything is there and you don't feel overwhelmed at all
[1:17:11] <Daxalog> But I LIKE that stress
[1:17:11] <Saltmeisterr> also TITS
[1:17:16] <dreamfillah> "I look at the moon and see a perfect society."
[1:17:21] <%valriot> 4X sounds like Elon Musks daughter
[1:17:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> Seems busy as shit, but I'll take your word for it.
[1:17:31] <Wondabarrapa> If a 4X does not have a clean UI, it is not a good UI
[1:17:31] <Khorneflakes_> LUL knew it

[1:18:26] <ha2ken> Not enough science.
[1:18:27] <%barkon345> What happened to Total War Hammer 2?
[1:18:28] <Flea_of_Flames> Ive always wanted to get into 4X games but could never get passed the barrier to entry stages of learning. This really does seem a lot cleaner.
[1:18:35] <Khorneflakes_> researching in the game, is pretty easy, just click the things your empire is lacking or could improve on.
[1:18:37] <Mr_Strut> I fucking love research trees
[1:18:45] <%zyberion626> THE COUNCIL DEMANDS MORE FAT DOSH FOR MORE GUNS
[1:18:51] <%valriot> Can you make content for Destiny in here? Someone has to
[1:18:55] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah people sometimes just need to find the right 4x game if they want to try and get into them.

[1:19:00] <+Tokanova> THE DUST MUST FLOW!

[1:20:42] <@SoFarFetched> @NickCaesar7 Certain games people tend to go for more than others,like some like fantasy settings for certain things over space things. Especially if its like you like a certain genre,but only depending on the setting for it.
[1:20:47] <j0ustar> are the chain gangs the YouFace feature?

[1:22:57] <%GohanHitsugaya> But insta murder is fun...
[1:23:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> You like management/strat games, Pat?
[1:23:11] <%kyh9> @BallinArbiter It's more like a 4X x RPG game in space
[1:23:12] <%JojoPiero> No they make him sweat
[1:23:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> just bombard them from a range and outmaaneuver them
[1:23:15] <RollCritFail> Yeah, but has there been a Civ as good as 4?
[1:23:19] <Incrodon> @BallinArbiter A simpler and MUCH more digestible game than Stellaris. Not neccesarly better but its good
[1:23:21] <+Skyebaker> 4x games are simple once u play through 1 Winged jsut think explore and research until u need a military

[1:30:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Group think eh? We sure these still aren't just humans? Kappa
[1:30:13] <Incrodon> @rytyoung I say quiick™ because even smal games with AI can take a while, with more than 2-3 people it can take a fucking long time due to everyone taking turns.
[1:30:13] <%Typhaeon> Fellow comrades
[1:30:14] <%CursedNobleman> notice me amoeba Kreygasm

[1:30:36] <Khorneflakes_> They also like you exploring the curiosities in their system, with probes
[1:30:39] <Parapattern> If you meet one Amoeba, haven't you met all of them?
[1:30:41] <+Remery_> Mate with them
[1:30:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Amelmobos
[1:30:44] <Incrodon> @rytyoung I think everyone takes turns at the same time kinda but still, LONG

[1:31:47] <TheApeGatsby> If you have a good PC loading between turns even in huge games with 10+ AI takes like 10 seconds at most
[1:31:52] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:31:54] <Incrodon> @Midashu You must colonize/build worlds so your empires population can seduce on their own. You are too busy to seduce!

[1:32:55] <%Typhaeon> That's a cool name
[1:32:56] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt So, the tutorial kinda fucked you on that. You can adjust settler ships and probe ships. For vaulters you would remove shields and add a new hyper drive so it can go twice as fast
[1:32:57] <Perky_EDF> I forgot about that shitty pun
[1:32:59] <j0ustar> Dust is LIFE
[1:33:00] <1matheuw> money tree?

[1:33:44] <%twoto858> The Event Horizon
[1:33:44] <Mr_Strut> This game is purty
[1:33:50] <Perky_EDF> You have limited probes. You can install more via ship modules or unlock ways to increase capacity.
[1:33:51] <Incrodon> @aonagainhaha Space Corporate Monarchy, he isnt expanding aggressivly enough. The empire is all about drowning others in mass production and conscripts.
[1:33:52] <Parapattern> Loot Boxes
[1:34:03] <%CursedNobleman> hoo boy. here comes the complexity
[1:34:11] <1matheuw> pretty much it seems

[1:34:17] <%Jekado> snort that warp dust
[1:34:20] <Andrizzleton> It's not wine it's Transvine
[1:34:34] <j0ustar> Once areas like that nebula fall under your control, they can buff surrounding systems, or help in battles

[1:35:14] <%Valdorick> Always improve production first, that's my rule.
[1:35:15] <%Midashu> Pat has the ultimate cheat ability, save scumming. Though he is limited in usage and it's on a cooldown currently.

[1:35:52] <%deviljhojho_> this makes my brain become the big brain
[1:35:53] <Perky_EDF> Research in this game is overwhelming at first.

[1:36:49] <$ragingbrachy> FeelsBadMan
[1:36:49] <Monkeyweed21> colonize both
[1:36:49] <%Jekado> to far
[1:36:49] <Mister_McDerp> Mediterranean is inhospitable?
[1:36:51] <Pookiedaexzile> @Incrodon That doesn't sound very honorable brother. Loyality and purity mark our linage back to the God emperor himself
[1:36:51] <MayShip> same
[1:36:55] <Fenlig> How many planets can you live on Pat?
[1:36:56] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah it's apparently stellaris,but better.
[1:36:57] <Perky_EDF> God. As someone who plays Ship Born primarily it's weird seeing individual planets.
[1:36:57] <1matheuw> who woulda thunk
[1:36:58] <%aishman> Aah thanks @SoFarFetched I'm glad seeing him play this game cause I was a BIG fan of Endless Legend 1 which got WILD
[1:36:58] <%Valdorick> Its sorts like Stellaris, yes.
[1:36:58] <%dirtyh4rr1> who would have thought
[1:37:00] <%Jekado> i think its out of your influence

[1:37:22] <%Jekado> go explore the other route first
[1:37:26] <+Skyebaker> dont waste colony ships early shit sucks to get back
[1:37:28] <aonagainhaha> why not both
[1:37:35] <Parapattern> Sabel II looks like if Japan was the entire planet

[1:37:51] <%ScreamLord> Space Colonies would probably be more viable than Planetary Colonies for a while
[1:37:52] <lionmanguy> You are limited in how many systems you can safely take, always prefer systems with more planets and of greater size
[1:37:55] <Mister_McDerp> no turning in space
[1:37:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is your ship a shark or some shit?
[1:37:59] <Incrodon> @Pookiedaexzile Yes, Lowalty to god Corporate King, ruler of the 1% and the wallmarts and disney. But they can't make litteraly more than infintie money by just e xploiting humans! THINK OF ALL THE MONEY THEY CAN MAKE BY EXPLOITING OTHER RACES!

[1:57:14] <+FilthyHereticHorus> On 1 planet....now do it for your whle empire >.>
[1:57:17] <laguerrilha> @BigNaturalMan59 which is more complex, this or TW: W2?
[1:57:17] <gryffinp> do farm yeah
[1:57:20] <+FilthyHereticHorus> whole*
[1:57:21] <%Meltdown547> Make sure to put up a fence.
[1:57:24] <+rowboat_girlyman> farmed super hard bro
[1:57:28] <j0ustar> Eli go up
[1:57:31] <huskarl_zap> Probably this cause its a real 4k
[1:57:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @CursedNobleman yes
[1:57:37] <%Ipsenscastle> @Dhurkst fair! It's not necessarily a complaint, I'm just wondering what ES's unique features are
[1:57:42] <Khorneflakes_> HOT
[1:57:42] <@BigNaturalMan59> probably TW
[1:57:46] <RollCritFail> @CursedNobleman Both until Robo-Putin shows up, then just the monster girls
[1:57:47] <gryffinp> Well the trick is that you build improvements for entire systems, not specific planets
[1:57:48] <huskarl_zap> Open wet market planet
[1:57:48] <+rowboat_girlyman> pretty much
[1:57:51] <Incrodon> @CursedNobleman The ayys they come with like katanas and honor, so they like nerd xeno's that say "NOW IM MOTIVATED"
[1:57:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> Endless Space 2 lore is fuckin amazing though
[1:57:55] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat can you build more explorer ships
[1:57:56] <Futurecity10> yeah but you need food for hot systems to produce more
[1:57:56] <%Zombrocom> TW is pretty simple
[1:57:58] <Mr_Strut> The heat keeps the workers from resting
[1:57:59] <%UvBenServed> Nice

[1:58:10] <+rowboat_girlyman> go to rigel
[1:58:13] <+rowboat_girlyman> probe there
[1:58:15] <@BigNaturalMan59> Endless Space is simple once you are exposed to every mechanic
[1:58:24] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @PatStaresAt Remember to probe Uranus.
[1:58:26] <huskarl_zap> "We're all probed up" Probably mandatory soon
[1:58:26] <KeggyH> Pat, queue up multiple things at once so when one finishes you start on the next; techs and construction rent actually measured in “turns”
[1:58:31] <Parapattern> More cabbages for the Cabbage God
[1:58:36] <%Zombrocom> Total warhammer is a really simple game actually, all the 4X civ management is pretty straightforward and stuff, it just has actual RTS battles to do
[1:58:37] <laguerrilha> thank god, any more difficult than TW i cant handle. barely can keep up with TW
[1:58:38] <@BigNaturalMan59> its just that theres a lot of them, and each faction has a different unique mechanic
[1:58:44] <+unrulyjester> :D
[1:58:48] <RollCritFail> How do I get probed down?
[1:58:51] <+barrakuta371> Is the next rebrand Angry Pat Stares?

[1:59:35] <s1rcuit> @Dakuu75 it's not that outrageous, lava planets a good for industry because it's easier to get and process metals, ice planets are good for science because they're remote and relatively unchanging
[1:59:37] <Baeltyr> the jellyfish enjoyed your comment about their dicks
[1:59:37] <BallinArbiter> @barrakuta371 super best angriest pat stares at castle
[1:59:39] <Incrodon> I love how the riftborn react to flesh things like how a normal person reacts to shoggoths, and they need special tech not to freak out to death when near other races.

[2:00:51] <Mister_McDerp> get savannah colonization so you can get Heka
[2:00:51] <Monkeyweed21> I think Pat is too stupid for 4X games like Total Warhammer
[2:00:52] <%Ipsenscastle> @WheatlyXT I have like 100 hours in Stellaris and I honestly wouldnt be surprised if I was playing wrong in some way
[2:00:54] <%thebonebard> pat saying hes anxious about people dieing in warhammer is like a guy i know that was anxious about his xcom guys dieing thinking it was meant as a punishment and not a mechanic
[2:00:55] <%InugamiTheHound> psaBig BLIND
[2:01:08] <ovan20> BIG rooBlind
[2:01:08] <%WheatlyXT> @ipsenscastle psaBig mood
[2:01:10] <Dhurkst> @bignaturalman59 "simple" and "a lot of mechanics" doesn't make sense to me
[2:01:18] <RollCritFail> But what about an Ass Planet?
[2:01:22] <laguerrilha> oh faster transport routes?
[2:01:31] <@BigNaturalMan59> theres a lot of moving parts, but each part is easy to comprehend
[2:01:33] <%Zombrocom> It's possible to have a lot of simple mechanics
[2:01:37] <%WheatlyXT> Go for the ass planets Pat
[2:01:37] <Pookiedaexzile> We live on an ass planet
[2:01:45] <Incrodon> SAVAHNA, TOO HOSTILE, MAN HAS NEVER EXISTED, NOR EVOLVED IN SUCH CONDITIONS
[2:01:47] <Incrodon> NEVER EVER
[2:01:48] <%WheatlyXT> Are you an ass planet or tits planet man
[2:01:48] <kazadaz> Warhammer 2 is more complicated, but also easier to play without understanding the complexity
[2:01:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can't tell me what i can can cannot colonize!
[2:01:54] <$sniffy77> HUGE GAS
[2:01:59] <@BigNaturalMan59> gas giant bois
[2:02:00] <Mister_McDerp> cha-ching
[2:02:00] <%Dakuu75> that space ship just made a U-turn... I find that funny
[2:02:01] <j0ustar> BIG DUST GET
[2:02:01] <laguerrilha> @BigNaturalMan59 yeah, the menus and tutorials so far are very easy to understand
[2:02:04] <OzzySnek> Hahaha, gas
[2:02:08] <%UvBenServed> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[2:02:09] <lionmanguy> Systems with a single gas giant are terrible, until late game anyways
[2:02:11] <+barrakuta371> Investigate the curios
[2:02:12] <+aslfrasle> "HUGE GAS" Just like Pat.
[2:02:13] <ovan20> it's a huge gas, good luck settling on it LUL
[2:02:16] <lilredmage> THATS MY MONEY YOU FARTING, GAS GIANT
[2:02:17] <+theAPPLESAUCER> theAPPLESAUCER subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:02:17] <%InugamiTheHound> this reminds me of mass effect 2,3
[2:02:18] <%Zombrocom> What's complicated about warhammer?
[2:02:19] <lionmanguy> No
[2:02:19] <Pookiedaexzile> So when will Pat make all the Planets Cubes
[2:02:21] <j0ustar> or colonize
[2:02:21] <Khorneflakes_> Nope
[2:02:24] <Monkeyweed21> no
[2:02:24] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt this song sounds like the FF prelude
[2:02:24] <gryffinp> Crazy talk
[2:02:29] <%arancet> smear your influencer grease on it
[2:02:32] <j0ustar> yep
[2:02:32] <lionmanguy> That's for the special nodes
[2:02:34] <kazadaz> Zombrocom: the huge faction and unit diversity
[2:02:34] <%WheatlyXT> Is huge gas what keeps the orb shape perfect?
[2:02:38] <lionmanguy> Make more colony ships, like the first one
[2:02:44] <Monkeyweed21> exploring gets you special resources pat
[2:02:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> With a steak brush
[2:02:48] <xxmagonx> Influence buildings
[2:02:49] <%optimasmaximas> you gotta tweet
[2:02:52] <+barrakuta371> With a butter knige
[2:02:53] <@BigNaturalMan59> whats he playing? imperium?
[2:02:54] <the_createy> heya
[2:02:55] <Incrodon> no
[2:02:57] <+barrakuta371> *knife
[2:03:01] <the_createy> what race is this?
[2:03:03] <Scrub_Seeker> no you just colonize it
[2:03:03] <RollCritFail> Follow Planet on Twitter
[2:03:05] <Sotetsu> Just build a colony ship and settle there
[2:03:08] <Monkeyweed21> you dont need to own it to take shit
[2:03:08] <%WheatlyXT> Use a spoon so it’ll hurt more
[2:03:08] <+Skyebaker> just colonize
[2:03:08] <@BigNaturalMan59> nah you still gotta colonize
[2:03:10] <Incrodon> HAVE to send a ship
[2:03:10] <xxmagonx> You unlock influence buildings
[2:03:13] <scrublord009> HUGE SPACE 2
[2:03:14] <j0ustar> yep
[2:03:14] <+Skyebaker> once u colonize ur good
[2:03:16] <%Zombrocom> You only play one faction at a time though, so it's not that bad
[2:03:18] <xxmagonx> In the tech tree
[2:03:28] <+Skyebaker> nope
[2:03:31] <%Jekado> pretty much
[2:03:32] <+Skyebaker> gotta tech up
[2:03:32] <Incrodon> @PatStaresAt Only the Fish Tiddie race can expand without ships, and t hey need to use money
[2:03:34] <gryffinp> You may have noticed the text saying "Missing technology"
[2:03:38] <@BigNaturalMan59> sooner than you'd think
[2:03:39] <kazadaz> Exactly-- more complex, but more approachable
[2:03:40] <+FilthyHereticHorus> can't colonize till you research the ability to do so
[2:03:45] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt would you recommend this?
[2:03:46] <%Jekado> shoot out another probe i guess
[2:03:47] <%Tman451> Do the different factions have different colonization reqs?
[2:03:48] <j0ustar> keep it mind for later
[2:03:49] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You gain influence through unique planets and culture research tree
[2:03:50] <+Skyebaker> its y u usually focus on research upgrades early unless u have a specific gameplan
[2:03:55] <Incrodon> THEY ARE MIGRATING AS WE SPEAK
[2:04:02] <j0ustar> oh PERFECT!

[2:04:55] <TheApeGatsby> Thats a unit of population from the curiosity
[2:04:56] <Parapattern> "It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?"
[2:04:58] <kazadaz> that's the people you just found
[2:04:59] <+Skyebaker> @Shackle_Rustyford the cncept is similar but stellaris mechanics and real time strategy is completely different
[2:04:59] <xxmagonx> Yes
[2:05:02] <%luftraumm1> imagine pat playing rimworld
[2:05:07] <%WheatlyXT> Shoot first don’t think

[2:12:45] <+solomonpun> @PatStaresAt click the pirates and see who owns them, pirates are only a threat if they are from a neutral faction you are enemies with/are aggressive in nature.

[2:12:49] <Monkeyweed21> 1 gun

[2:21:06] <kazadaz> Very hype for Humankind
[2:21:09] <%charlieroday> lol its a game thats purely HUD
[2:21:09] <%TheWinged7> thats whack
[2:21:11] <gryffinp> Worth noting about the colony law: colonies are only "outposts" before they are proper colonies. Still good though.
[2:21:12] <thinktank1> flybyno is sick

[2:22:01] <gryffinp> Dimitri is a fucking BOSS
[2:22:05] <Incrodon> @PatStaresAt Also I think you have enough influence to do a favour for the Amemba's, if you complete the favour, you get ownership of their world, and by extension, them!
[2:22:05] <Doc_matty> oppress colonies, check! oppress school children, check. Gundams appear = Profit 📈!

[2:24:21] <laguerrilha> heroism isnt free
[2:24:29] <librettodude> what about an adventure mayor?
[2:24:39] <steelstwitchaccount> So to get new guys you gotta uncover an ancient legend... that all?
[2:24:45] <gryffinp> Now the deep thoughts: put him on the capital to maximize bonuses, or on the new system to get it up to speed
[2:24:57] <@BigNaturalMan59> thats a good choice
[2:25:08] <j0ustar> he's doing it!
[2:25:14] <Incrodon> @PatStaresAt Now, see if you can do a favor for the ameoba's! Should you complete it, you get immediate ownership of their system and all they own!
[2:25:37] <gryffinp> As far as I know that screen, zoomed into that level is totally useless

[2:31:02] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt The trade scan is for trade routes, the economy scan is telling you "Hey, you have these planets that you haven't done anything with"
[2:31:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> pretty rad stuff
[2:31:04] <GoYaK> Look at all this amazing NONEXISTING trade
[2:31:10] <LorcaNomad> How long is a turn supposed to represent in this game?

[2:53:08] <POUNDCAYK> I wish I could get into Endless Space but Stellaris has a death grip on my ass
[2:53:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> So is Pat just making the United States in Space then?
[2:53:16] <+Skyebaker> yuup
[2:53:21] <+Tokanova> this game looks a lot better than stellaris...
[2:53:22] <GoYaK> basically
[2:53:26] <+stevenlambchops> fully automated space communism when
[2:53:34] <%heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks Oh, I'm aware. IRL it sucks
[2:53:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> They be like pilgrims
[2:53:42] <+unrulyjester> @PatStaresAt you ever play endless legend?
[2:53:44] <librettodude> This game is a lot more RPG than Stellaris, which is more sandboxy
[2:53:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Pilgrims.
[2:53:48] <+Tokanova> ooo
[2:53:53] <+Tokanova> become EVEN MORE better
[2:53:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yey space capitalism ho
[2:53:56] <gryffinp> @Tokanova Honestly they are totally different beasts. Liking or disliking one has little bearing on the other
[2:54:15] <Khorneflakes_> Kappa
[2:54:17] <@SoFarFetched> LAME

[2:54:48] <%heartlesshealer> smiling 'cause she put a bayleaf in the food
[2:54:49] <@BigNaturalMan59> for the pirates
[2:54:50] <+FennecZephyr> They do, but they suck
[2:54:51] <%Jeemukun> we also like looking at pat TheIlluminati
[2:54:52] <j0ustar> yes. and kill those pirates soon
[2:54:52] <Daxalog> Theyll get creamed by the pirates
[2:54:53] <gryffinp> They technically have weapons
[2:54:54] <kazadaz> You should make one to explore
[2:54:55] <GoYaK> Yes, but actually, no
[2:54:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> might be a good idea
[2:54:55] <%kyh9> This game has such a comfy vibe
[2:54:56] <huskarl_zap> if you have to ask
[2:54:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Arms race, arms race, arms race, arms race, arms race.
[2:54:58] <+waltzqueen> Awwww
[2:54:59] <kazadaz> make REAL ships to fight
[2:55:04] <%captainpodock> How the hell do you know of you're winning?
[2:55:09] <omnishadeee> edit ur ships design 1st
[2:55:09] <thinktank1> make a new ship design
[2:55:10] <zamzoph> has Pat done ANY combat yet?
[2:55:10] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt You should make a real military soon, research that ship tech!
[2:55:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @captainpodock You're not dead
[2:55:20] <Khorneflakes_> The science upgrade is good
[2:55:21] <Incrodon> @captainpodock you really don't until you are litteraly about to win, or someone else is
[2:55:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Watch Pat get attacked on the next turn
[2:55:36] <librettodude> the curse of 4x/grand strat games is the Victory Lap phase
[2:55:40] <MyNameIsRasus> It would be really cool if humanity ever got this far
[2:55:42] <+keyoray> @CommanderSqueaks that sounds like life. i like it!
[2:55:50] <GoYaK> Pirates will fuck him up
[2:55:53] <omnishadeee> click the arrow in the top left bar and from there u can edit ship designs to make ur current ships better
[2:56:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, this tech screen scares more less than other 4X screens
[2:56:07] <Incrodon> Pirates are inreasonably powerful in the early game
[2:56:15] <@SoFarFetched> Pervy?
[2:56:18] <+TallPixels> pervy.
[2:56:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pervy speeeeed

[3:06:48] <MyNameIsRasus> I am extremely fast at getting my shit beat out of me

[3:07:27] <@BigNaturalMan59> yea tokonova
[3:07:29] <gryffinp> I like how the sci fi community just agreed that shields beat lasers and kinetics beat shields
[3:07:32] <+Tokanova> sweet
[3:07:42] <huskarl_zap> LASERS ARE LESS ACURATE
[3:07:54] <SGrim> Ballistic Laser combo
[3:07:55] <%TheWinged7> !uptime
[3:07:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 8m.
[3:07:56] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @gryffinp "The slow blade penetrates the shield"
[3:08:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Pat just making a fast turtle?
[3:08:03] <kazadaz> how bout some PROactive plating
[3:08:09] <%SpicyVibration> How are lasers less accurate than anything?
[3:08:11] <@BigNaturalMan59> your plasma tech is higher
[3:08:15] <Rionxgarland> is endless space 2 a remake of the first game more or less
[3:08:17] <Incrodon> PEW
[3:08:19] <huskarl_zap> Exactly
[3:08:25] <%starotter70> psaPorgmo
[3:08:26] <Mister_McDerp> sick
[3:08:27] <%kyh9> ISNT IT GREAT
[3:08:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> PEW PEW
[3:08:28] <+Tokanova> thats so cool
[3:08:28] <omnishadeee> its not a remake
[3:08:31] <Incrodon> ELMO SCREAMS IN PLASMA
[3:08:35] <%DappercatEsquire> Shoots like PEW PEW
[3:08:35] <%kyh9> This game REALLY sells its premise
[3:08:36] <+The_Protagonist> DO IT AGAIN
[3:08:37] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @PatStaresAt you can even test it before you build it
[3:08:38] <j0ustar> are you sold yet Pat?
[3:08:47] <+The_Protagonist> PEWPEW
[3:08:47] <GoYaK> PLASMA ELMO, PLESMO
[3:08:49] <%starotter70> AH THAT'S HOT, THAT'S HOT
[3:08:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> It go pew pew
[3:08:56] <Incrodon> @FilthyHereticHorus not really
[3:09:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> brrrrrrrrrr
[3:09:02] <@BigNaturalMan59> slugs give you missle defense bc you shoot them down
[3:09:02] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Edit the game files for Emlo scream whenever gun shoot
[3:09:05] <MyNameIsRasus> G U N
[3:09:05] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @Incrodon sort of
[3:09:13] <%xcompleasedad> IT'S THE GUNS FROM THE EXPANSE
[3:09:13] <%kyh9> No, you want your Fleet yo be all-rounder
[3:09:14] <%TheWinged7> "Ultra-dense slugs" so it fires politicians then?
[3:09:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ugh, why make Mario.
[3:09:14] <Incrodon> fair
[3:09:14] <the_createy> for a game essentially a pile of tables and number this game have a very good visuals imo
[3:09:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't make a Mario ship
[3:09:18] <%charlieroday> looks rectangular to me
[3:09:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> missle and gun go brrrrrrrr
[3:09:20] <%kujofire990> psaPorgmo
[3:09:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> @huskarl_zap @SpicyVibration lasers unfocus the longer the distance, and their shots cannot be course corrected like missles
[3:09:27] <Monkeyweed21> All rounders kinda suck
[3:09:27] <%RPG_CHICAGO> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[3:09:27] <@SoFarFetched> ELMO SCREM
[3:09:28] <+Tokanova> make ships that are all in on projectile... and then make a second type of ship that are all in on energy
[3:09:28] <librettodude> Fleet comp is a little more important in ES IIRC
[3:09:29] <%kyh9> @TheWinged7 lol
[3:09:32] <katocrimson> elmu
[3:09:37] <gryffinp> This early, the finer points of ship design are probably irrelevant. Do whatever makes you feel good so long as all of the slots are full
[3:09:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I always preferred a group of specialized ships than just a bunch of Marios.
[3:09:41] <Incrodon> @PatStaresAt Bullets act as defense too, so its typically good to have it imo.
[3:09:43] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaGib psaElmo
[3:09:44] <%starotter70> he screm
[3:09:45] <kazadaz> swiss army ship
[3:09:45] <$MemnonV> it needs a holodeck
[3:09:47] <j0ustar> go gun for now, speed can wait. you need a good defensive posture
[3:09:49] <%Valdorick> GUN
[3:09:49] <Khorneflakes_> Good choice
[3:09:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can TRUST a bullet
[3:09:52] <GoYaK> G U N
[3:09:54] <%captainpodock> Emlo is barking commands about how he wants you to construct his ships
[3:09:57] <Mister_McDerp> the GUN is good
[3:09:58] <@BigNaturalMan59> bullets are short range
[3:09:58] <%R3Roundabout> psaPorgmo FATHER, I SEEK MILITARY MIGHT
[3:10:00] <%WhereIsWill> he screm but you cannot hear it in space
[3:10:02] <@BigNaturalMan59> which aint bad
[3:10:05] <kazadaz> honestly all-rounders are okay early on when you're just fighting pirates
[3:10:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sex is evil, the gun is good.
[3:10:07] <Daxalog> Youll have to rely on close range though. And battles can change ranges
[3:10:09] <%DappercatEsquire> AC 130 in SPACE
[3:10:11] <Senselessvirus> AND THEN I PULL OUT MY GUN
[3:10:15] <Incrodon> ELMO IS SLOW
[3:10:16] <Khorneflakes_> LUL 2 speed
[3:10:17] <gryffinp> holy shit no, do not remove the engine
[3:10:21] <%Gohyakuen> bullets + shields are good this early
[3:10:22] <+DaVinci04> What up pat?
[3:10:28] <Incrodon> ELMO WILL NOT LEAVE COUCH
[3:10:28] <gryffinp> the engine affects how fast the ship moves on the galactic map
[3:10:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Holy long until Pat sweat with this?
[3:10:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> **How
[3:10:37] <kazadaz> Engine is mandatory
[3:10:38] <omnishadeee> omg 2 speed
[3:10:40] <%charlieroday> did paige just hand a glass with only 6oz?
[3:10:44] <Incrodon> Right side
[3:10:50] <%PenmanLupine> Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space!
[3:10:51] <$MemnonV> pick the longest range so you can run away like a coward
[3:10:53] <%charlieroday> excuse me... uhhh. 200mL?
[3:10:57] <Khorneflakes_> 5 speed is on the normal side, so good
[3:10:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @charlieroday How could you actually tell? You must have super eyes or are watching on a TV.
[3:10:57] <GoYaK> S P E E ED

[3:26:22] <iteruq> make his ship better
[3:26:26] <%TIME_PUNCHER> This Empire should be the Fur Eaters, don't @ me

[3:41:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Thiccest
[3:41:19] <manoshake> click on watch
[3:41:23] <%YakumoYomi> Thicc and VEINY
[3:41:30] <Khorneflakes_> Your ships are shooty pew pew, so the closer the range the better.
[3:41:40] <ShichiNoBushi> "Minimum CP"
[3:41:48] <gryffinp> Honestly I never learned how to actually use this system properly, I just outgun the opponent and use a rush the fuck out of them strategy every game
[3:41:50] <ShichiNoBushi> "Minimum 1 CP"
[3:42:12] <omnishadeee> the games combat, despite being automatic, has a lot of stuff going on
[3:42:27] <%Taisuru> MAKE SURE TO HIT THE WATCH BUTTON
[3:42:28] <Khorneflakes_> It's hard to see but there are arrows in those boxes
[3:42:28] <+FilthyHereticHorus> the big + at the top left
[3:42:29] <@BigNaturalMan59> thats a good formation
[3:42:29] <Mister_McDerp> I am also confused
[3:42:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah Watch
[3:42:33] <Monkeyweed21> the little blue arrows

[3:42:40] <NeroInfinite> HIT WATCH
[3:42:41] <%aishman> Make sure you click WATCH
[3:42:44] <%YakumoYomi> For a minute there, I thought it said "Garbage Fire" instead of "Barrage Fire" in the middle option.
[3:42:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> look at em over at 2 LUL
[3:42:46] <ShichiNoBushi> In Endless Legend, combats turn into their own turn-based strategy games.
[3:42:47] <%xcompleasedad> CLICK WATCH
[3:42:54] <NeroInfinite> yes
[3:42:58] <l33tc4k3> oh phew
[3:42:58] <GoYaK> YES
[3:43:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeye
[3:43:03] <Incrodon> @gryffinp Its wierd, Auto battle simulates differently than watching, A.I will always cheat and choose the best option to fight you, your ships refused to shoot at other flotillas while theirs do not, they also focus fire while your fleet spreads it out. Its fustrating.
[3:43:04] <Monkeyweed21> THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ENDLESS SPACE 1
[3:43:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LAUNCH

[3:44:25] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt The actual battle is fun to look at, but has no bearing on success beyond what you do in the prebattle screen, IRRC
[3:44:32] <Coystick> Nice work beating up that special needs tugboat
[3:44:37] <%Ynkubus18> Someone spilled coffee on a bridge console in your ship

[3:46:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Stellaris's naval battles are rather simple and are usually sending one fleet after another. Though the game does let you customize your ships including their behaviors.

[3:49:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know, stopping the pirates near your colonies is great, but you really should go and take care of planets where pirates MIGHT show up, just to be sure. In fact, any race that has pirates, may want to just handle them. You know, just to be safe.

Back in 2013 I said I didn't like a character in a show, and the entire fandom of said show roasted me in the comments on my DeviantArt. I didn't hide their comments, and they stay as a monument to their pettiness.
