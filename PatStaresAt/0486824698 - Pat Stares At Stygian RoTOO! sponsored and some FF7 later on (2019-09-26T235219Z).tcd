[0:19:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like the Cthulu story where they dynamite the reef and the older gods are all like "Well, I guess we can't do stuff now. You win humans."
[0:19:40] <Reanimator83> Getting fucked to hell sounds interesting
[0:19:42] <%jeffishype> its an american thing

[0:20:11] <%CrimsonCore90> What I come into?
[0:20:23] <%cerazor01> What happened to Brennan?
[0:20:29] <%SolverCODO> That's it exactly, just truncated
[0:20:30] <%ElenaManetta> "Can you do me a favor?" means just do me a fucking favor

[0:21:54] <+Cervarian> Has a wrestler had an anime op done as an intro yet? I'd be surprised if the answer was "no"

[0:24:30] <%Doruben> @AngriestPat so nice of you to get the games of 1B Games and Focus home interactions names right
[0:24:31] <%FailureTwoComply> I want to make a game, just so I can sponsor a Pat stream and watch him dump his balls all over my project.
[0:24:32] <%Conyst> that is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange eons even death may die. @angriestpat
[0:24:34] <%skizzuto> BATMAN?!
[0:24:39] <+kittenlovah> what is this game? is this like Darkest Dungeon?
[0:24:41] <%mh9s> are you the batman?
[0:24:43] <%cerazor01> It's always fockin Arkham with Lovecraft
[0:24:45] <%ElenaManetta> There's a board game?
[0:24:45] <%Typhaeon> Batman: Arkham Eldritch Horror looks like a weird turn for the series
[0:24:45] <%WhereIsWill> ARKHAM!?!?
[0:24:45] <butthurtdave> Boy, Arkham gets a lot of mileage in media dont it?
[0:24:46] <%StrokeGodBillionare> where is jason todd

[0:24:51] <yourliteraldog> It's all public domain
[0:24:52] <%bevyrage> this feels like we're watching a board game trailer
[0:24:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Boardgame is good.

[0:58:07] <%floralkami> @lewdskeletor13 first person Pat talked to put a dart in his face cause Pat went psych on his hobby.
[0:58:08] <Graxe_> Almost
[0:58:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That air will kil you dead.
[0:58:08] <%Bad1uck> Air Embolism
[0:58:09] <Valdorick> Syringes, Pat's archenemy.

[0:58:10] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah because it's a MYSTERY
[0:58:12] <%dekkitout> What WAS in the syringe prior?
[0:58:12] <%SolverCODO> Shower thot
[0:58:13] <@commanderclaw> Air will kill you
[0:58:13] <%TheHoodedTeddy13> So what is this game and what’s this about
[0:58:16] <alrobot2014> injecting air is a fuck
[0:58:16] <%Bt_Robot> Because of the bubbles
[0:58:18] <DexteraXIII> Like Stray Cat, but a needle
[0:58:19] <%InugamiTheHound> shoot up all the Heroine like in Seattle!!!
[0:58:19] <rumuloh> Does Pat know about the tainted syringe boss in this game?
[0:58:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Air is super deadly
[0:58:20] <Karhax> nah, air embolisms are not that big of a deal
[0:58:22] <%transporterthesequel> Schrodinger's syringe
[0:58:23] <%arancet> well, not if the plunger is pushed
[0:58:24] <jou_star> true
[0:58:24] <+Estuko> monkaS the air pumped in you is super danerous
[0:58:25] <Valdorick> Air will straight up kil you if its hits your heart.
[0:58:25] <+BubbaRands> air WILL KILL
[0:58:26] <%dukenux> air in bloodstream = very painful death
[0:58:26] <%SirGO0SE> air in blood
[0:58:26] <%Divryne> AIR BAD.

[0:58:27] <%Charuzu> embolism
[0:58:27] <%vectorless_peon> brain anurisim
[0:58:28] <%SirGO0SE> is dead
[0:58:28] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Because air in your veins is an instant stroke
[0:58:29] <yourliteraldog> Air Bubbles
[0:58:30] <%cvp5127> air bad
[0:58:31] <%BioApple> but what if they want to use you to un-empty the syringe
[0:58:32] <%demegodz> Ah ha
[0:58:32] <%Dr_Mooose> it's super rough
[0:58:33] <+jjjkopf> Run from the doctor, got it
[0:58:33] <RyuuAoi> ALL THE AIDS
[0:58:33] <RupanSen> they have to hit you precisely into a vein tho
[0:58:34] <%dekkitout> I learned that from Arrow
[0:58:34] <%starotter70> Right right
[0:58:34] <jman13131313> air
[0:58:35] <%Gogogolem> What about stuff that kills you slow?
[0:58:35] <Graxe_> Or your brain
[0:58:35] <+xddddsorandom> REMEMBER KIRA
[0:58:36] <%WhereIsWill> the air will straight mess you up
[0:58:36] <GameOver_Here> Thats why my syringes are always filled with whiskey
[0:58:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> this is part of the channel lore
[0:58:38] <%Agami23> just like stray cat and yoshikage kira.
[0:58:38] <%deviljhojho94> tomatoConcern ?

[0:58:43] <Marpolo13> air = evil
[0:58:43] <%AMajorTom> That’s overblown
[0:58:45] <thelonechris> So if I had the choice between a syringe full of sulfuric acid or an empty syringe, I go empty?
[0:58:45] <%Bad1uck> Not immediately, and it depends on the volume of air
[0:58:45] <jou_star> truth.
[0:58:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Tears itself apart

[0:58:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat sharing his goblins with the rest of us
[0:58:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Except for the natural methods.
[0:59:00] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That's why The Bends is so bad for divers
[0:59:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Not immediately but its still deadly
[0:59:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> it won't NECESSARILY kill you. it will only PROBABLY kill you.
[0:59:01] <ExpressNode> I think that happens to swimmers when they dive too deep
[0:59:03] <%mh9s> big heart oopsies
[0:59:04] <+Mitchellsocks> I feel like most syringe shankings aren't precise enough to find a vein
[0:59:04] <%dekkitout> That sounds like a big risk for people who are into inflation
[0:59:05] <ape_hawk> i remember an episode of the drew carey show where Mimi did that to a cat she was petsitting
[0:59:06] <%Chichen> fuck off thats cthulhu
[0:59:09] <%Dr_Mooose> that's metal
[0:59:10] <jou_star> mmm air bubble.
[0:59:11] <%ElenaManetta> I mean, I would think a needle full of cyanide is just as dangerous as air

[1:33:19] <%starotter70> Probably like 1920's or something
[1:33:27] <%Ninestempest> @Axel6561 yes, much like old fallout
[1:33:31] <yourliteraldog> He mentioned the spanish civil war
[1:33:33] <rumuloh> 1910 is when the gun was produced, so you I don't see the issue
[1:33:34] <%Axel6561> oh nice
[1:33:38] <%croxeye> oh no is it bug?
[1:33:39] <%dukenux> bugged?
[1:33:39] <%floralkami> SOCKS (it is what it is)
[1:33:40] <%CalderGaming> if he talked about the Civil War in Mexico, 1910s-20s
[1:33:41] <pectusumbra> @Axel6561 it's basically like a crpg or the like
[1:33:42] <%Ninestempest> oh i figured he meant the american civil war lmao
[1:33:47] <%croxeye> oh huh
[1:33:48] <%croxeye> lol
[1:33:48] <%Ninestempest> i was so confused

[1:50:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> an alarm for sleep
[1:51:06] <Valdorick> Did you invent a way to not flee from battle? Kappa
[1:51:06] <%Bt_Robot> Looks like the alarm spell
[1:51:07] <%dukenux> he'll get there
[1:51:12] <%deviljhojho94> Big brain
[1:51:14] <%deviljhojho94> crikIQ
[1:51:20] <%ChaosAethr> So FF7 time?
[1:51:20] <%ElenaManetta> It feels like Darkest Dungeon mixed with that Penny Arcade game
[1:51:21] <ミュウレ4242> lovecraft's mad scientists usually invent ways to see things they shouldn't see.
[1:51:23] <Valdorick> (I mock you for it, but I'd likely just die over and over agian like a bitch)
[1:51:54] <+socialistOtter> clearly the correct build is the build where you beat eldritch horrors to death with a club
[1:51:55] <+Papafleish> are there even non-ambush fights
[1:52:08] <pectusumbra> this time you can not get ambushed hopefully
[1:52:09] <%starotter70> apatWhat MY EYES
[1:52:15] <thelonechris> Eyepatch time
[1:52:22] <Valdorick> Yeah, important question for this game. Does Cthulhu have a health bar, and could I in theory drop it to 0?
[1:52:29] <%dukenux> wrench!
[1:52:38] <CapCasual> Wads of Dollars = Junk
[1:52:40] <%Conyst> equip wrench

[1:53:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Because they're lunatics. They don't know what they do.
[1:53:41] <%ChaosAethr> Shoot That Mother****
[1:53:48] <Hellarussian> Arturo is super tough
[1:53:51] <%starotter70> I wish it was that simple irl

[1:54:15] <%Ninestempest> yeah def shoudl put arturo on front lines and keep yourself further back
[1:54:28] <+Majiinbooh> since when does getting shot do less dmg than bein ghit with a club?

[1:56:54] <%Dr_Mooose> ???
[1:56:55] <konarius> this doesn't look like "stand in same spot and slug it out" sort of game
[1:56:56] <%Laecerelius> Run, Pat! Run like the huge coward you are!
[1:56:57] <+g8rhead> but why

[1:57:06] <%Swampykins> why
[1:57:07] <%Bt_Robot> Why would you retreat?
[1:57:07] <%KoyaMusa> why did you do that you could have won???

[1:57:32] <%Laecerelius> He hates xp and he loves getting angst
[1:57:33] <+Papafleish> you coward
[1:57:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think retreating gives angst @AngriestPat
[1:57:41] <%griffball13> but you get angnst
[1:57:44] <+socialistOtter> it's the same experience but it doesn't mean you get the same angst
[1:57:48] <einSynd> Experience, sure, but do you get items
[1:57:51] <%joylent_blue> angst is good guys don't worry
[1:57:51] <ape_hawk> STRUGGLE BEGINS
[1:57:53] <%king_wragles> He gets the same reward for retreating, save for the after fight loot
[1:57:55] <%NeroInfinite> struggle begins
[1:57:57] <Hellarussian> uh oh
[1:57:58] <+socialistOtter> angst is NOT good
[1:58:06] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue IS IT!?

[1:58:36] <MojoKingIzakku> you might want to retreat to heal dawg
[1:58:42] <connorussell> who doesnt

[1:58:46] <%ChaosAethr> oh Nvm
[1:58:56] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue Oh thank god, seems like my teenage years weren't a complete waste
[1:59:00] <Valdorick> Sing the song of your character - "darkness enveloping me"

[1:59:37] <+socialistOtter> hit people in the back when possible
[1:59:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> open wide, baby. here it comes.
[1:59:40] <Daxalog> Cast Armegedon! Crazies dont have fire immunity
[1:59:45] <%Bt_Robot> You are playing a D&D game and specializes in non combat abilities.
[1:59:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> use BRAVER
[1:59:58] <%MightyMaxT> Ready for Crazy Talk
[2:00:00] <%ChaosAethr> Welp Nice knowing you

[2:00:09] <Valdorick> That's right, hide behind the hired muscle!
[2:00:12] <%demegodz> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[2:00:12] <$i_am_therydon> if you don't bitch out maybe
[2:00:13] <konarius> the dude who considered babies with black and white parent a protent of impending doom would of course write female protoganistsafsd
[2:00:14] <nademonkey1100> are they throwing shit
[2:00:20] <+Papafleish> combat is dumb just talk your way out of things
[2:00:24] <%linSP> what is this sekiro
[2:00:31] <ape_hawk> you dont know its poop? could just be rocks
[2:00:33] <ragasquid> yes
[2:00:35] <RyuuAoi> Does this game seem unfair to you?
[2:00:38] <%dekkitout> @konarius Was that dude the Time Cube?
[2:00:38] <datmouse> try to find common ground
[2:00:43] <ape_hawk> (but yeah, its poop)
[2:00:52] <TwitchingFrog> @ape_hawk Why not both?
[2:00:53] <%joylent_blue> yes Lovecraft WAS the Time Cube
[2:00:54] <%croxeye> but why wouldn't you try and just kill one of them?????
[2:00:59] <Valdorick> The shape, sound, and the raving lunitic weilding it tells me its bricks...
[2:01:04] <%griffball13> it's how damaged they are instead of nimbers
[2:01:08] <Hellarussian> damage amp?
[2:01:08] <+krawtch> number go down
[2:01:22] <%Bt_Robot> Dnag it Pat, have you forgotten all the lessons you learned in Pillars? Focus down one character at a time.
[2:01:24] <Daxalog> Uh oh
[2:01:24] <+Darren716> Does this game have a combat difficulty setting? This just seems unfun
[2:01:27] <waifoong98> just focus on one to reduce their dps
[2:01:29] <%Bt_Robot> *dang
[2:01:29] <%boondoggle42> Is Pat any better at this than Xcom?
[2:01:31] <Valdorick> Hey wait, if Edwado dies, do you get hs stuff?
[2:01:36] <ape_hawk> eddy's deady
[2:01:43] <Hellarussian> probably
[2:01:50] <%Conyst> Pat almost dead.
[2:01:51] <%Ninestempest> you think?
[2:01:55] <Daxalog> Double Kill!
[2:01:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So is this an Ironman run?
[2:02:00] <ミュウレ4242> or lore that helps you fight whatever it is.
[2:02:01] <%dukenux> yooo
[2:02:02] <%Bt_Robot> Or just don't make your character a librarian
[2:02:03] <%Archphronimos> As a note: Pat is not built for combat, he's built to avoid combat
[2:02:06] <RupanSen> or a summon
[2:02:07] <%dukenux> HEal Eduardo!
[2:02:11] <RyuuAoi> Annoying that they always attack first and multiple times.
[2:02:15] <nademonkey1100> R I P E D
[2:02:17] <%dekkitout> Or build into luck and idiot savant through hell and highwater
[2:02:19] <%Ninestempest> also wow why is initiative so fucked
[2:02:24] <%Ninestempest> it seems utterly random
[2:02:24] <Valdorick> Can you spend AP on moving so you can melee attack the back?
[2:02:29] <konarius> better fish for rear attacks and crits though then full party
[2:02:34] <+socialistOtter> they don't always attack first, ed usually attacks first
[2:02:34] <%Dr_Mooose> 3hp
[2:02:37] <rumuloh> It's based on stats @Ninestempest
[2:02:37] <coracor> monkaS

[2:12:29] <yourliteraldog> can you stay at the in
[2:12:29] <%noobpsyboticus> this town looks like SHIT
[2:12:32] <%Sokumotanaka> @mugwugsampoo Agreed, eye seering white was the WORSE choice
[2:12:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> so this game looks dope, but I can't buy it till Pat punches an elder god.
[2:12:43] <Zooperton> SourPls
[2:12:49] <%deviljhojho94> its an unique look thats for sure. Like an ascended newgrounds game
[2:12:49] <Solokaldaka> fallthulu
[2:12:52] <%linSP> cthuluout
[2:12:54] <%ElenaManetta> It's old school Fallout

[2:13:01] <+AlatosDiogenes> Fall of Cthulhu
[2:13:01] <+socialistOtter> pat isn't gonna be punching an elder god with his build
[2:13:03] <%Dr_Mooose> everything works to the style of the game
[2:13:04] <+krawtch> cthulhu 76
[2:13:05] <%dekkitout> Fallout(of Sanity)
[2:13:05] <rytisone> Cthulu 76
[2:13:11] <%ElenaManetta> In fact, some of the old clunky stats is more traditional Fallout than modern 3D
[2:13:14] <thetruenicster> Stygian, the Fallout of Cthulu Games
[2:13:18] <shinichizio> It's JUST Fallout 1, the best CRPG ever
[2:13:19] <%Bad1uck> get the jesus
[2:13:21] <+YabbaTroll> Im not that big on the art style
[2:13:21] <%Piemen99> fuck the bible
[2:13:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> i like fallout i like cthulu
[2:13:23] <ミュウレ4242> fallout isn't a bad format to shove a lot of text lore into a game.
[2:13:24] <%deviljhojho94> its a good book
[2:13:27] <%ElenaManetta> and when I say clunky I mean complex with numbers
[2:13:28] <%Ninestempest> LOL
[2:13:29] <%dukenux> maybe its based of GURPS
[2:13:29] <Daoshinto> @dekkitout Fallout of Sanity is pretty good.

[2:15:57] <%deviljhojho94> This is one of those cthulu games that wants you to spec into combat...
[2:15:57] <ミュウレ4242> you'd think killing four of them in the street before would make them shy away. i guess they really are insane.

[2:16:53] <%Ninestempest> that's cool as hell
[2:16:57] <%deviljhojho94> I say a combat build would have a better time here
[2:16:58] <%Ninestempest> like Divinity?
[2:17:03] <%Ninestempest> or just actual builds
[2:17:05] <%SoleilAstier> I would go premade first to get a feel

[2:17:16] <Daxalog> But are they good premade characters or Wizardry RP pre made characters?
[2:17:17] <duffmd1> vvvBal
[2:17:17] <%deviljhojho94> like hardboiled mcbeef seems ideal for a game with so many fights
[2:17:28] <+socialistOtter> make a character that just beats people with a club

[2:43:45] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat you're a poopy head
[2:43:46] <%Dingus_Tickler> Ricky’s a bitch atpRtsd
[2:43:47] <Valdorick> AFter you play normal
[2:43:49] <%Faustgesicht> Rider remains uncalled out
[2:43:54] <+socialistOtter> it's not boomeerism, it's 100% a millennial thing
[2:43:56] <Neo_Kaiser> MillennialPat
[2:43:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> pat isn't a boomer though. he's a millennial.
[2:43:59] <%InugamiTheHound> pat was born a boomer, molded by it!!
[2:44:06] <SomersaultJustice> are you going to stream jedi outcast?
[2:44:06] <DXLelouch24> WELP
[2:44:10] <ShichiNoBushi> I hate the concept of "optimal builds".
[2:44:12] <%marsanta> Pat's a boomer at heart though
[2:44:12] <DXLelouch24> WOOLIE BEAT YOU TO IT PAT
[2:44:13] <KishinGrek> Boomerism starts off with "back in my day."
[2:44:13] <Valdorick> After all, using a pimped out pre-made build is the same thing as just maxing out every stat - change my mind.
[2:44:16] <%floralkami> @kiiiirsten noooooooooooooo, I'm a flower, THE flower god, no stinky
[2:44:19] <DXLelouch24> GOOSE GAME PART 1
[2:44:19] <%Niney_Who> The Optimal Build is the one you have the most fun with
[2:44:33] <%Sokumotanaka> Speaking of WHEN KOLTOR 2 NERD!? XD
[2:44:34] <%Dingus_Tickler> @sir_stride Kind of tired of all these games being exclusive indefinitely to PS4. We could’ve had a Bloodborne that ran at 60 FPS evo19MindBlown
[2:44:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> millennialestpat
[2:44:36] <ape_hawk> a... LOT
[2:44:40] <%SirGO0SE> I don't have fucking time to play a game twice anymore. I already have the next one queued up. So I wanna do it right the first time.
[2:44:41] <%janoonoo> @AngriestPat My niece actually calls people stinky poos as an insult. I love it.
[2:44:41] <ShichiNoBushi> When's Jade Empire?
[2:44:41] <%Big_Dream> GOO-GAH US PAT
[2:44:42] <%Laecerelius> Cavalier Pallies are fucking good. Oh no, I can't use a bow! Guess I'll just have to use all of these throwing weapons instead!
[2:44:43] <%kiiiirsten> @floralkami it's good to have goals :)
[2:44:46] <Dovakhin573> But that takes away my fun of making my own build
[2:44:47] <%JohnAtDawn> What does the C stand for?
[2:44:48] <%laserbeaming> Making bullshit builds in CRPGs is probably my favorite part of playing CRPGs
[2:44:50] <+BlockingDisabled> Berserker/Mage for me...
[2:44:57] <$Sir_stride> @dingus_tickler bloodborne with mods brownRAYGASM
[2:44:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rumtumtugnutz most people know that. the idea behind the meme is that it describes people who start to become out of touch
[2:45:02] <%Sokumotanaka> @Shinigamiking13 I want woolie to do that one
[2:45:05] <%cvp5127> what does the c in crpg stand fpr?
[2:45:06] <%kiiiirsten> I have been watching Pat play video games for like 10 years and I DONT appreciate his Diet Coke Bottle Tap trying to tell me how 2 game
[2:45:09] <konarius> rule of thumb; premade in first run, custom later on
[2:45:11] <%marsanta> Big problem with Pathfinder:Kingmaker is lack of that
[2:45:15] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> @cvp5127 computer
[2:45:16] <ape_hawk> @cvp5127 computer
[2:45:19] <%CrimsonCore90> Character rpg
[2:45:21] <%kiiiirsten> Pat telling me how to FUCK! my character hmmm
[2:45:25] <Cecion> classic rpg
[2:45:26] <%Sokumotanaka> @ShichiNoBushi No u
[2:45:28] <%Charuzu> fallout is GURPS? huh I never realized that
[2:45:30] <%floralkami> @kiiiirsten like being able to see over your car's dashboard
[2:45:34] <%arancet> shit, i played RO, an MMO where respec didnt exist for like 6 years
[2:45:35] <%SirGO0SE> The best RP
[2:45:36] <%Archmortal> Planescape is another one where there's one correct build that can fit everything and if you don't know it, you miss a ton of shit.
[2:45:36] <@lewdskeletor13> I heard we were switching over to eco terrorism
[2:45:39] <%laserbeaming> Pathfinder Kingmaker gives you 3 free respecs now @marsanta
[2:45:41] <%zamzoph> MEOW
[2:45:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Divinity is also nice that builds don't really feel necessary in order to do well
[2:45:45] <ShichiNoBushi> @Sokumotanaka Maybe I will.
[2:45:46] <cham52> Always use the same build for every game ever. ALWAYS GO FULL DAMAGE. NO COMPROMISES.
[2:45:46] <%Fear_Ranjer> he screm!!!
[2:45:46] <+socialistOtter> please do not fuck your character
[2:45:47] <JittersCaffeine> There's supposedly a licensed Fallout TTRPG coming out next year
[2:45:49] <yourliteraldog> eco terror

[2:46:13] <RupanSen> eh, you can roll pretty much anything in Fallout as long as you don't care about powegaming
[2:46:13] <%kiiiirsten> da bebe
[2:46:17] <%Sokumotanaka> @ShichiNoBushi *gasp* no u is too powerful!
[2:46:17] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat would never be able to play D&D with 3d6 in stat order.
[2:46:18] <ape_hawk> the REAL fun in crpgs is when you play as the evil guy
[2:46:22] <cureneckbeard> The idea with D&D is originally that if you build a shitty character, they die until you make a good one
[2:46:29] <SomersaultJustice> ff7 has good music, but that one synth is awful
[2:46:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and no one will still watch it

[2:46:38] <%kiiiirsten> I haven't had a cat for like 10 years, which is an unfair statistic. I need kitty cat
[2:46:41] <%SirGO0SE> for fire emblem im always permadeath hardest on every run and i regret that this time along. still on 1st play
[2:46:45] <%Intolerable> Cthulhu RPGs?
[2:46:49] <TomDanksEGOT> Grim Dawn is a fantastic CRPG
[2:46:51] <%laserbeaming> @marsanta well... I played the tabletop, so I didn't have much problems, just imported the busted Magus I played on my table
[2:46:52] <%Nobrev> my friends got me to play devinity 2 with them and it was a huge amazing fun cheat fest. I was a skeleton so I could be immune to death fog
[2:46:54] <+faithless_zealot> G'evening, Pat =)
[2:46:55] <+Forente> Would a easy mode work
[2:46:57] <JittersCaffeine> I just recently had a wind hare that drove me to play through older Bioware RPGs. It's been pretty fun.
[2:46:59] <%kiiiirsten> Elmo BITE HIS ASS
[2:47:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> aw, someone being nice in a dono instead of name calling
[2:47:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat's the kind of guy to replay Pokemon intro until he got a female started with max starting stats
[2:47:13] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> what

[2:52:08] <%MisterTylerrr> It's god punishing you for drinking, you SINNER
[2:52:09] <%nmaten> !Americans at risk!

[2:52:09] <%BoboDaHobo> @big_dream yeah, that's why I stopped alternating between the two of them, big sad though
[2:52:11] <%ElenaManetta> All my experiences with dehydration usually result in temporary blindness
[2:52:15] <%takiyami> Not recommended for Americans
[2:52:15] <%velemi> LUL
[2:52:17] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:52:19] <%starotter70> Drink the IV

[2:52:27] <%walternatorz> Pat is ethical.
[2:52:28] <%jiin6> Pat stop thats Illegal

[2:52:33] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> YES
[2:52:34] <%ElenaManetta> What hospital ISN'T open 24 hours
[2:52:35] <%Mr_Strut> Clearly
[2:52:35] <%Conyst> literally drink water as you drink achohol
[2:52:35] <%starotter70> Will do
[2:52:35] <%ScreamLord> Water and Tylenol can also help
[2:52:35] <%marsanta> So Pat is endorsing raiding hospitals, got it
[2:52:37] <simulationbard> There's a Freeman's Mind bit about this
[2:52:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> True. But that's a lot of work.
[2:52:37] <%PanicSwytch> yes
[2:52:38] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> I think you are
[2:52:38] <%FrustratedAF> that sounds like yes
[2:52:40] <%Guardiansaiyan> Instructions Unclear: Arrested
[2:52:40] <cham52> I'LL BREAK INTO THE HOSPITAL PAT, I'LL DO IT FOR YOU
[2:52:40] <RupanSen> or just... drink water?
[2:52:40] <cureneckbeard> It's not breaking in, hospitals don't close
[2:52:40] <%Divryne> DRINK THE IV JUICE.
[2:52:41] <%BoboDaHobo> weirdly specific denial
[2:52:42] <connorussell> IM DOING IT RIGHT NOW
[2:52:42] <Neo_Kaiser> So age has nothing to do with it?
[2:52:43] <%jiin6> YOU ARE
[2:52:43] <jimmytwofeet> OKAY I WILL
[2:52:43] <Desertfishing> a coworker of my sisters got fired for doing that
[2:52:45] <deity_majora> ya
[2:52:46] <%CrimsonCore90> Oral Rehydration Solutions are proven just as effective!
[2:52:48] <%snow_bush> Like one does
[2:52:48] <%Ynkubus18> Get plastered then romp into the hospital, cant go wrong
[2:52:48] <%SirGO0SE> the fruit drinks for infants that are flavored?
[2:52:49] <%nmaten> just casually lying around
[2:52:49] <TomDanksEGOT> I used to have a friend who was a medic in the marines who used to hook up a saline drip after rough night
[2:52:49] <%merylinspants> i'm pretty sure like LA and Vegas have people who will come to you with ivs for that pat
[2:52:50] <%Niney_Who> "Bro gimme your saline bro, right in my mouth"
[2:52:52] <omen_setter> Get one of those George Clooney doctors
[2:52:52] <Valdorick> What I'mh earing is... Just inject salt water right into my viens from my own house?
[2:52:52] <+Roundelay11> backalley doctors are cool too
[2:52:52] <%SirGO0SE> what is it that shit called
[2:52:53] <cureneckbeard> Dr Mario is not a real doctor
[2:52:53] <%Dr_DangerPhD> yeah, a "doctor"
[2:52:53] <leinadtonu> too late, on it now
[2:52:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> @connorussell PRETEND YOUR A COP
[2:52:54] <%mh9s> a real doctor, like you pat!
[2:52:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Medical license lost.
[2:52:56] <%nmaten> just drink pedialyte
[2:52:57] <%fatally_furious> thats probably unethical
[2:52:58] <yourliteraldog> I think you can buy saline
[2:52:59] <%Archmortal> Perhaps if you simply drink water
[2:52:59] <JittersCaffeine> Dark theme 4 life
[2:53:00] <%InugamiTheHound> can you drink IV bag water?
[2:53:04] <%CrimsonCore90> Drink Drip Drop and Pedialyte!
[2:53:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I miss the purple dark mode
[2:53:06] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat isn't Saline basically highly filtrated water with some salt in it?
[2:53:07] <+SilverSnowFFXIV> That seems like a great way to increase your chances of catching a hospital super bug.
[2:53:07] <%starotter70> Wouldn't IV taste disgusting?
[2:53:07] <%jiin6> Backstreet doctors are REAL doctores
[2:53:09] <MojoKingIzakku> remember to scream "THIS IS FOR PATRICK BOIVIN" as you break in
[2:53:10] <%SirGO0SE> @nmaten PEDIALYTE YAY YAY AYAYA
[2:53:11] <nademonkey1100> what is this Non dark mode
[2:53:12] <TG_Cid11> I think you can actually buy the IV stuff online
[2:53:16] <%kiiiirsten> Reported 2 da gubberment
[2:53:16] <+Zereaux> WHY IS DARK MODE NOT FUCKING DEFAULT FOR EVERYTHING
[2:53:19] <chambatron> And @AngriestPat When do I transition to injecting meth on my veins?
[2:53:19] <konarius> that's one of the most over complicated and time consuming solution to a hang over
[2:53:24] <%firehawk_420> It looks the same on mobile
[2:53:27] <%kiiiirsten> I use dark mode for EVERYTHING
[2:53:29] <%Deano8817> apatGib

[3:07:06] <%MrBorisMakarov> @ckkc1 OH NOOOOOOOO
[3:07:08] <DeoxysPrime> In a league with 10 teams two of them had the same name!
[3:07:09] <TyrantBelial> Indians is a racist term because native americans AREN'T INDIANS
[3:07:09] <RupanSen> that's pretty offensive
[3:07:10] <%Takreth> apatSmug
[3:07:11] <%Fear_Ranjer> The sports team called "The Redskins" who thought that was a good idea?!!?!?!
[3:07:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> But, the roughriders were Theodore Roosevelt's crew.
[3:07:13] <+Xelig> @AngriestPat I constantly forget that you're canadian because you don't sound any different than Americans from around where I live.
[3:07:14] <%Deano8817> cleaveland steamers
[3:07:15] <ckkc1> @MrBorisMakarov OH YESSSSS

[3:07:17] <%abakkus> @AngriestPat i'm a marylander and i've spent my whole life surrounded by r*dskins fans and it is. hoo boy. it is just bad. hoooo boy.
[3:07:19] <Louie_Salmon> The reason that names like that don't change is partly just laziness.
[3:07:21] <ThespianBarrage> Good news, I'm from Saskatoon. So.... yay roughriders....
[3:07:23] <%Niney_Who> My favorite team, the Tennessee Slavers
[3:07:25] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> Rough riders weren't even Candian.
[3:07:29] <%NeroInfinite> IT'S BETTER THAN REDSKINS man

[3:15:45] <JittersCaffeine> Ah yes, the customary menuing before the RPG stream
[3:15:47] <%InugamiTheHound> @YeetOfTheMoment yup it was funny. But nothing too bad
[3:15:49] <%laserbeaming> Gonna farm money by selling All Materias?
[3:15:49] <%Kilagn> @AngriestPat I just finished FF8 for the first time today. Amazing game, good story, and after learning the junction system I loved/abused it. 3x Speed def helps with drawing magic to become the big strong.
[3:15:51] <%hussdogrob> GOOSE GAME WHEN!?
[3:15:52] <%fatally_furious> @stacemcgate LUL

[3:15:56] <rhus> Noita's PRETTY GOOD TOO
[3:15:59] <Valdorick> Its a strong year, meaning next year will be another 2016. Expect at least 20 high profile deaths, a bad selection of games, a company or two going under...

[3:16:14] <%Agami23> @Kiiper it is your shit taste, but thats fine.
[3:16:19] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Oh god, this is my first time tuning into a FF7 stream, I HATE that his name is RedBull 13!
[3:16:20] <%Shadicara> does it give you everything

[3:17:13] <JittersCaffeine> Man, I really glad that menu naviagtion doesn't make a really annoying noise or anything
[3:17:13] <%StaceMcGate> all this materia management just to later 3x speed battle and spam attack
[3:17:18] <%hussdogrob> @valdorick danke
[3:17:33] <Neo_Kaiser> Better than FF8, hours in the menu just to spam Limit Breaks.
[3:17:38] <tanarath> Shadicara: Allows you to target all enemies /allies a set number of times per battle
[3:17:38] <+metalsiren31> Ahhhh that's sick. DMCV is too good for us
[3:17:53] <%Bad1uck> Is manipulate good besides for getting enemy skills?

[3:18:38] <%ssjklyco> @hussdogrob I'm waiting for my physical
[3:18:39] <%MightyMaxT> This kind of planning is why I love FFX's battle system. Doing that in battle and stratigizing feels good
[3:18:58] <%Laecerelius> I loved being able to see the turn order in FFX
[3:19:11] <ape_hawk> FFX is the SHIT
[3:19:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> FFX Represent!
[3:19:13] <Valdorick> FFX, love the gameplay, hate the story.
[3:19:16] <%Ninestempest> the turn order in X is fucking great
[3:19:17] <%hussdogrob> @ssjklyco fair very fair
[3:19:18] <%InugamiTheHound> not Grand wizard wakka?
[3:19:19] <%MightyMaxT> Agreed
[3:19:21] <%Kilagn> FFX PogChamp
[3:19:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Too bad it has Tidus
[3:19:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I like when Wakka throws the ball REAL good
[3:19:25] <%StaceMcGate> Love FFX battle system, but not the battle theme
[3:19:25] <yourliteraldog> albed?
[3:19:26] <%Kyderz3> @AngriestPat did you ever play ffxi?
[3:19:27] <RupanSen> yeah, it's one of its few pros

[3:19:54] <%Ninestempest> >Thinking atlus will let us do anything
[3:19:55] <ape_hawk> dude, they let people stream p5 regular
[3:19:56] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat I think they pretty much dropped the embargo on the original
[3:19:57] <%JohnAtDawn> Persona 5 playthrough was the biggest coward move on the channel
[3:19:58] <%fatally_furious> no reason to either
[3:19:59] <%Dotta5> hey it's that dog
[3:20:01] <+textandnumbers> People streamed Persona 5 and nothing happened to them.
[3:20:01] <%Conyst> that's funny Pat
[3:20:01] <+CaptainJax> WHENS SMTV YOU FUCKS
[3:20:02] <%laserbeaming> Keep dreaming
[3:20:04] <Neo_Kaiser> Battle Chasers battle system is FF10 on steroids!
[3:20:05] <ape_hawk> they didnt do antyhing to any streamer, dude
[3:20:05] <%Laecerelius> The sphere grid is also cool since you start out with everyone being their own class but you can have people branch out as time goes on
[3:20:05] <%Comtrya> Thats some backwards ass shit by atlas
[3:20:10] <%Archmortal> fuck modern Atlus tbh
[3:20:12] <%InugamiTheHound> is that musou version of that game?

[3:20:25] <%D33TR> i think you have to use yuffie
[3:20:25] <ScarletPrime> But what about when Atlus bans people from streaming the P5 Warriors game?
[3:20:26] <HoldBtoRun> that's Yuffie only
[3:20:26] <%StaceMcGate> Yuffie mandatory @AngriestPat
[3:20:29] <%AbnormalVoid> Yuffie solos it dude lmao
[3:20:30] <%hussdogrob> They will let us stream persona five from the switch when it releases on the switch because it's releasing on the switch 😭

[3:20:58] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat All you need is enemy skill and reflect to beat it
[3:20:59] <%Ninestempest> i've seen dozens upon dozens of streamers play P5
[3:21:01] <+Merkensteiner> Yuffie is pretty neat\
[3:21:02] <%Ninestempest> and not have ANY issues
[3:21:02] <%fatally_furious> @screamlord its basically piracy 4Head
[3:21:05] <%Ninestempest> it's a shitty stupid threat
[3:21:07] <konarius> get Paiges channel nuked by streaming dodgy stuff
[3:21:09] <%MisterTylerrr> Yuffie is not even a close second
[3:21:12] <%Shadowthedigger> Shadowthedigger subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:21:18] <%MisterTylerrr> No you don't
[3:21:19] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to GabeSweetMan!  
[3:21:25] <holydeviant1> This segment, like many in FF7, is only distantly recalled to me, like a bizarre fever dream. I don't even remember how I did it.
[3:21:25] <%MisterTylerrr> You can do that shit in disc 3
[3:21:26] <%InugamiTheHound> that's for levithan summon right??
[3:21:29] <%Sokumotanaka> I seen plenty let's players and streamers play persona 5 with zero problems

[3:21:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bort with that profile LUL
[3:21:36] <MainMan_Jonadiah> These character names are killing me, I saw Cait Sith for half a second.
[3:21:38] <%hussdogrob> @angriestpat Are you considering a full playthrough of Deadly Premonition 2 when it comes out?
[3:21:40] <rhus> if you want to max out all the enemy skill materia, you leave this battle for last, actually
[3:21:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> believe it
[3:21:49] <%StaceMcGate> Palmer
[3:21:51] <rhus> since the last guy uses trine
[3:21:51] <%ssjklyco> @ninestempest with Pat's luck, he'll be the one channel that gets hit. it's usually better not to temp fate
[3:21:52] <%kujofire990> fucking love her name is bort
[3:21:55] <%Laecerelius> Look at all those sexy, sexy slots!
[3:21:59] <%starotter70> I honestly think that P5 is TOO big for people to get in legit trouble for streaming it
[3:21:59] <Neo_Kaiser> I'm pretty sure you can do it whenever.
[3:21:59] <%AbnormalVoid> Edincoat is Palmer

[3:22:18] <Neo_Kaiser> Dying as Yuffie won't kill you
[3:22:19] <rhus> PAT VS QUINT 2
[3:22:24] <%Ninestempest> @ssjklyco sure, I guess, it's just mostly shitty on atlus for threatening and then not being consistent on what is allowed

[3:27:02] <%StaceMcGate> Ultra Instinct Cheating
[3:27:02] <%Bad1uck> @AngriestPat I'm sure you've answered this, but are you going to stream the FF14 Nier raid?
[3:27:03] <Valdorick> Uh, why is this Wuutai guy a fucking monster?
[3:27:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Strident does things outside of starting cults all the time?
[3:27:04] <%fatally_furious> that one guy mentioning it reminds me, @angriestpat you thinking about checking out Battle Chasers Nightwar, that game is sick
[3:27:11] <%boondoggle42> Are there any details out Deadly Premonition 2? Are you playing as Zach?

[3:27:25] <$TheDoctor19901> yea but having to regrind for all your rmour blows balls
[3:27:26] <%Ninestempest> Not everything! Forsaken stuff still needs a license I believe

[3:27:29] <tanarath> no more publisher bs
[3:27:34] <%Laecerelius> I don't think that forsaken is FTP

[3:41:00] <TonberryLives> As he is want to do
[3:41:00] <%boondoggle42> @laserbeaming it's Eli... it's a furry girl with a dick
[3:41:02] <%starotter70> The Elmo Dust
[3:41:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> Pat is BLIND
[3:41:05] <%Bad1uck> @mothdude Would you rather the angry water snek god just randomly wipe out seaside villages
[3:41:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Was it before or after the saline injections?
[3:41:08] <%Bad1uck> ?
[3:41:10] <Valdorick> @Breakfast_Megapowers Ja Ja... Praise Yevon
[3:41:10] <holydeviant1> @AngriestPat when the ELMO hits
[3:41:12] <%starotter70> It's coming for your sinuses
[3:41:15] <%crimsonharvest> is this Doma, where's the dead peasants
[3:41:18] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you should be able to go into the cat house now
[3:41:24] <%zamzoph> time to never go to Wutai ever again
[3:41:25] <%SomeNEET> Pat hurt itself in its confusion apatDab
[3:41:29] <DedicatedHealer> @AngriestPat Only solution is to pet Elmo more
[3:41:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> Can't you go up in the mountains now?
[3:41:35] <ミュウレ4242> now to breed a golden chokobo.
[3:41:38] <ape_hawk> Wutai Clan can now GET FUCKD
[3:41:41] <%StaceMcGate> @supersugoisenpai1 he needs the scales for that
[3:41:45] <%supercasualboom> Nothing like sniffing Elmo fur and soda
[3:41:48] <Novapulsus> But no Turtle paradise
[3:41:50] <%starotter70> Yeeah
[3:41:59] <holydeviant1> Ye ye ye
[3:42:00] <%asurite_warrior> I think this place is a direct reference to the ninja village in japan that has been turned to the tourist trap. But when I hear the people complain about lost history and culture I just think the statement "Oh no our rich and vibrant history of shanking mother fuckers and poisoning bitches!!"
[3:42:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> this is just like my Japanese animes
[3:42:16] <%crimsonharvest> and shaking down tourists
[3:42:17] <%StaceMcGate> KOTR + HP Absorb + Mimic
[3:42:19] <%mayorrev> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[3:42:32] <holydeviant1> @asurite_warrior that's all ancient history in a nutshell, really
[3:42:39] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat should I play FF6 or Okami first totally blind on both
[3:42:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he ain't doing chocobo incest for knights of the round
[3:42:45] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat what are the best and worst materias you can find
[3:42:46] <holydeviant1> It all boils down to shanking bitches and poison
[3:42:51] <ミュウレ4242> having fastforward will make knightsoftheround spam worth it.
[3:42:57] <%Sokumotanaka> @SomeNEET Why not both?
[3:43:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FF6 because you will NEVER finish Okami
[3:43:03] <%starotter70> Temple Shit
[3:43:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> Clumhazard
[3:43:09] <%supercasualboom> Pat inflicted with fury from Elmo fur
[3:43:12] <holydeviant1> quick, someone look up what Pat needs to do
[3:43:13] <mothdude> Temple of the Ancients. But gotta get the key first.
[3:43:19] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat House near Gold Saucer, Find out about the temple of the ancient
[3:43:22] <%SomeNEET> Def doing both just cant decide which fist
[3:43:26] <holydeviant1> dig site
[3:43:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's date time
[3:43:33] <+J_Walter_Weatherman> oh god the digging
[3:43:34] <%Bad1uck> Bone digging
[3:43:35] <Marpolo13> why never finish okami?
[3:43:40] <%InugamiTheHound> no howl SFX
[3:43:45] <holydeviant1> ahahahah I forgot about the dig site!
[3:43:46] <Desertfishing> are you the key master? i am the gate keeper!
[3:43:48] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat So is this the Eathbound I keep hearing about?
[3:43:53] <holydeviant1> Isn't one of the ult weapons there
[3:43:57] <%AmericanaRed> WHENS ARMY MEN SARGE'S HEROES???
[3:44:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Marpolo13 its the game that doesn't stop
[3:44:09] <Valdorick> Its Dragon Quest VI
[3:44:11] <%supercasualboom> Don’t mix that up with the place inhabited by Smash players called Temple of the No Deodorants.
[3:44:11] <%starotter70> Yeah, it's not as good :(
[3:44:14] <%CalderGaming> it's Mother VII
[3:44:20] <alrobot2014> does okami have an ending?
[3:44:20] <%Fear_Ranjer> @AngriestPat What do you think Ungermax will look like in the Remake?
[3:44:21] <%asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat any plans of doing some old ass CRPGs here or more modern version say like baldur's gate or underail?
[3:44:23] <Marpolo13> @Breakfast_Megapowers not really. I've played it before. It's not that bad with that
[3:44:23] <%Sokumotanaka> @SomeNEET I say ff6 then take a break with the action fighting system from okami
[3:44:27] <%StaceMcGate> Will Doug Bowser prevent Earthbound like Reggie did?
[3:44:36] <fettsvett201> Pat, do you recommend any mods for first time play (graphic mods for example)?
[3:44:43] <Valdorick> @alrobot2014 Okami has an end credits screen.
[3:44:43] <%CalderGaming> okami has 4 endings, one after the other and 15 hours apart Kappa
[3:44:45] <%starotter70> After Paige beats FF4
[3:44:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> @alrobot2014 yes...Amaterasu goes to heaven with his waifu
[3:44:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he likes higher view counts more
[3:44:54] <Desertfishing> FF1 or bust
[3:44:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Marpolo13 are you one of the heralded ancient ones?
[3:44:56] <%ElenaManetta> Paper MARIO
[3:44:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> :<

[3:45:46] <%CalderGaming> "fornite"
[3:45:48] <%SomeNEET> Legend of Dragoon was the absolute raddest shit
[3:45:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Will you be reading Fanfiction?
[3:45:54] <%Frostydough1> D:
[3:45:57] <%asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat You probably need to be more of a chat stream for those to work. You think spy could make it work.
[3:45:58] <zipfile777> REEE

[3:46:15] <holydeviant1> I thank god every day my nephew has good taste and my sister isnt normiecore
[3:46:16] <ape_hawk> how do you feel about FF15 basically being a proof of concept for the battle system in FF7R?
[3:46:18] <+cafefunk> Oh
[3:46:19] <%supercasualboom> @caldergaming damn autocorrect
[3:46:20] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat We need more games where you play as dragons

[3:46:26] <%Sokumotanaka> @Valdorick That wont happen unless they an turn all the party members into bland boyband archetypes
[3:46:30] <sidstyler> you will never make it to the bronco aliiive!
[3:46:32] <%StaceMcGate> random battles are the worst when you're lost
[3:46:33] <%CalderGaming> @supercasualboom autocarrot is the worst carrot
[3:46:37] <moonmeh> god

[3:46:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know whats a good old school RPG to play? Chrono Trigger
[3:46:59] <%Fear_Ranjer> Oh hey my new morning alarm!
[3:47:00] <alrobot2014> that sound is terrifying
[3:47:01] <mothdude> Remember how this game has three different Bahamuts? Each with an attack more over the top than the last.
[3:47:02] <%MisterTylerrr> Pat did you hear they put Xenos in Dissidia NT? I can't believe how much money they waste on that heap
[3:47:10] <%supercasualboom> The sound is from the odor coming from Smash players
[3:47:12] <%mayorrev> MY EARS WutFace
[3:47:15] <ape_hawk> you know whats even better than Chrono Trigger? Chrono CROSS
[3:47:17] <%Sokumotanaka> @SomeNEET If anyone as tell them it's your S.O's normal scream
[3:47:23] <Marpolo13> LUL
[3:47:26] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What would you think of a Chrono Trigger Remake like the FF7 one?
[3:47:27] <%StaceMcGate> if only we had aqualung or trine or beta
[3:47:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> What happened to the other 12 Redbulls

[3:47:57] <%abakkus> crazy talked your crazy talk, i see how it is
[3:48:04] <%ElenaManetta> Pat should play Dark Cloud series, those dungeons are just BUILT for good streaming content
[3:48:05] <+Roundelay11> number go up

[3:48:11] <holydeviant1> I love how the plane becomes a shitty boat

[3:48:13] <sidstyler> boatplane
[3:48:14] <%Sokumotanaka> no I'm anti social
[3:48:20] <ape_hawk> when do we get the airshit?
[3:48:20] <+cafefunk> How are you doing tonight, Pat?
[3:48:21] <%supercasualboom> It’s too bad FF6 will never get a proper remake cause too many characters is too much work as a console game.
[3:48:24] <%CalderGaming> what disc would this be right now? @AngriestPat
[3:48:29] <broth_elemental> Itty-bitty Bronco
[3:48:43] <ミュウレ4242> slay all goblins.
[3:48:46] <%Laecerelius> I need to replay Dark Cloud 2 some day
[3:48:47] <sidstyler> this has to be at least disc 3
[3:48:50] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Tiny bronco, aka Halfhorse, Holhorse's half brother
[3:48:51] <sidstyler> wait really?
[3:48:52] <Marpolo13> wat
[3:48:54] <%laserbeaming> @CalderGaming he just did the Yuffie Wutai thing
[3:48:57] <OToole42> what kind of ape turns off random battles in a JRPG?
[3:49:00] <+cafefunk> Hey Pat, are you gonna play either Granblue Fantasy Versus or the new Guilty Gear?
[3:49:00] <%Basch71> Code Vein is fun
[3:49:07] <%Keyd00d> It's alright so far
[3:49:07] <ape_hawk> i heard code vein is.... okay
[3:49:08] <+Roundelay11> what did you think of Ashen?
[3:49:10] <sidstyler> Wutai is a ways into the game though isn't it
[3:49:12] <+plasticss> ive heard code vein is average
[3:49:17] <%Sokumotanaka> @supercasualboom Honestly it's not bad, with the current team beign the ff13 people who made like 5 stinkers I don't trust them with good stories like ff6 & 9
[3:49:18] <%Laecerelius> Ashen seems good
[3:49:19] <Valdorick> Wait, isn't this disc 2? Disk 1 ends at Juno, yeah?
[3:49:20] <Aydarkzero> yep!
[3:49:21] <rytisone> 7/10 Ign
[3:49:23] <Marpolo13> i haven't heard anything
[3:49:23] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Did you see the shopkeeper in Code Vein? That's a gooood game ;)
[3:49:27] <%shiny_prinny> code vein is bandai namco so ehh
[3:49:28] <ape_hawk> do you want GUNS
[3:49:29] <+valkuma> Nioh is SO much better.
[3:49:32] <%Keyd00d> disc 1 ends after cave of the ancients
[3:49:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Disc 1 ends right after Aeris dies
[3:49:35] <Valdorick> Oh god, how long has it been since I played this...
[3:49:36] <DokiDokiGonzalez> I may not care much for FF7 compared to other FFs but boy howdy is that overworld music good as hell
[3:49:42] <%FrustratedAF> wait which one was sci fi souls? surge?
[3:49:42] <+bohtimore_lean> Want vampire s
[3:49:44] <%ElenaManetta> Rip offs in the video game world are ok
[3:49:47] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat When you think about it, this plane moves super fucking fast. Just looks at your minimap and see how fast your moving across this planet
[3:49:47] <%SirGO0SE> preference driven. its good
[3:49:48] <Marpolo13> lol that's a fun way to put it
[3:49:49] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat House by Gold Saucer Pat
[3:49:49] <holydeviant1> time to dig
[3:49:51] <mothdude> Code Vein lets you create a Sephiroth in the character creator so it's pretty good.
[3:49:51] <+valkuma> after playing Nioh i cant go back.
[3:49:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Neo_Kaiser She dies??? D:
[3:49:54] <Aydarkzero> only thing is i don't like the loot in Nioh being like Diablo
[3:49:55] <MrMysteryMask> does sekiro count
[3:49:56] <%Futurecity10> Not enough to make it any good
[3:49:58] <Marpolo13> how was the Nioh 2 beta?
[3:49:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> It's not a rip off, it's legally distinct
[3:50:01] <%Futurecity10> Nioh fucking sucks
[3:50:03] <%Keyd00d> Nioh is better than a couple Souls games
[3:50:04] <%InugamiTheHound> dino
[3:50:04] <%noobpsyboticus> it's not even a rip-off
[3:50:05] <%AmericanaRed> we need a kids ver
[3:50:07] <%laserbeaming> Nioh is arguably better in some places
[3:50:08] <%supercasualboom> @sokumotanaka Kefka would be voice by Scarlet Johansson. Lol
[3:50:09] <%StaceMcGate> this enemy has 60k HP
[3:50:09] <%President_Miyazaki> Nioh 2 beta was good but limited.
[3:50:10] <%FrustratedAF> oh my its the time puncher, the puncher of time
[3:50:12] <%lethallunacyx> has aries died yet?
[3:50:12] <%Laecerelius> Yeah I'm not a huge fan of the Diablo loot in Nioh but I like everything else in it
[3:50:13] <%nmaten> lords of the fallen was the fucking worst one
[3:50:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> Playing Code Vein right now, it's very clunky but I like it
[3:50:19] <Marpolo13> interesting
[3:50:20] <%Fear_Ranjer> YO htat's cool
[3:50:21] <Aydarkzero> is that a raptor!?
[3:50:21] <%AmericanaRed> LOLISOULS
[3:50:23] <%Shadicara> These dumb monsters better be in the remake or no buy
[3:50:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nioh has more RPG in it
[3:50:24] <broth_elemental> Steal his nuts!!!
[3:50:28] <ExpressNode> I bought Nioh months ago but I can't seem to get the motivation to play it
[3:50:29] <%Sokumotanaka> @supercasualboom I'm having a fit!
[3:50:31] <ミュウレ4242> control is a ripoff, an dit's pretty good. just lets the SCPs take the spsotlight, like a godzilla movie does godzilla.
[3:50:31] <%Sokumotanaka> RIDE IT
[3:50:33] <cosmicgoatee> Elden Ring GRRM souls I can't wait for Norse God fights
[3:50:36] <sidstyler> nailed it
[3:50:36] <%baronblank> he does
[3:50:37] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:50:37] <mothdude> Cloud did the Up-B.
[3:50:39] <%AbnormalVoid> agh, you weren't supposed to tell him NotLikeThis
[3:50:40] <+CounterBeard> get them chocobo breeding nuts
[3:50:40] <Valdorick> Kill the Barroth!
[3:50:41] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat it does, it has a rare nut for chocobo breeding
[3:50:42] <Neo_Kaiser> This enemy has an important item to steal
[3:50:43] <%baronblank> this enemy suuuucks
[3:50:44] <MacheteGrande12> steal the nut
[3:50:45] <%Sokumotanaka> TAME IT AND REPLACE RED 13
[3:50:46] <+Roundelay11> people give Lords of the Fallen a ton of shit, but it wasn't THAT bad. just kinda mediocre
[3:50:50] <Jrockoni> O Lawd he HEALTHY
[3:50:51] <%Guardiansaiyan> STEAL
[3:50:57] <+manasaurusrex03> Oh yeah he do have 60k

[3:54:07] <%StaceMcGate> @ElizzGlaster switch version has an invincibility mode that heals you and gives limit breaks
[3:54:13] <Neo_Kaiser> Oh right, Pat missed Aeris's ultimate limit break
[3:54:16] <%supercasualboom> “Put something else in here...” Pat a dirty lyricist...or a rapper

[3:54:55] <mothdude> It's not too late to get Aerith's last limit break. Kind of a grind though, and she's leaving after next dungeon so it's not really worth it.

[3:55:12] <%manasaurusrex03> Hey pat think about bone village. The crashed airplanes are super old...implying that its old ancient technology. FF7 is in the far future, and the ancients may have been modern humans.
[3:55:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat If you could surgically remove your nose, would you?
[3:55:21] <%AbnormalVoid> You can get Kjata right now

[3:55:52] <%supercasualboom> You know you sucks as a FF character when yo ultimate is on Disc 1 on the 3 disk game
[3:55:52] <%InugamiTheHound> is that a rocket lodged inside of a dinosaur's skull?

[3:56:26] <%lethallunacyx> @abnormalvoid have to open the forest first
[3:56:28] <%CalderGaming> props to @ smarxist_ on twitter for having the Untitled Goose stab Aerith
[3:56:30] <ape_hawk> BLOW YOUR NOSE, DUMBASS
[3:56:30] <%SomeNEET> it's like rock paper scissors but furries
[3:56:32] <+Roundelay11> attack of the Elmo spores
[3:56:32] <%Dotta5> Sephiroth 11 conspiracy
[3:56:32] <%Keyd00d> It's alright
[3:56:33] <%Basch71> I have the actual game
[3:56:34] <DokiDokiGonzalez> take a little break and blow your damn nose dude
[3:56:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's Different
[3:56:39] <%noobpsyboticus> demo was great imo
[3:56:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, looks jank so probably fine
[3:56:41] <%supercasualboom> Tellah death > Aeris death
[3:56:41] <%fatally_furious> like Lords of the Fallen
[3:56:46] <TonberryLives> It is different
[3:56:47] <%D33TR> character creator seems good
[3:56:48] <%Lazyallaround> It’s fun pat
[3:56:48] <TheHeroAppears> does the demo still exist? I never got around to it
[3:56:50] <%crimsonharvest> this plane makes me think of Tale Spin
[3:56:51] <%cvp5127> its jank but fun
[3:56:52] <%Zombrocom> I mean, it's out
[3:56:53] <%Nobrev> demo was really good. I don't know why people called it clunky. it's pretty fast and fluid
[3:56:55] <%Keyd00d> Isn't it out? My friend is playing it
[3:56:57] <%Basch71> fun, feels like a bloodborne-ish game but with a god eater skin
[3:57:02] <+luckyturtelle> i really enjoyed the demo
[3:57:04] <%Lazyallaround> A bit slippery but fun @angriestpat
[3:57:08] <%AnIcedCoffee> I'm playing the full game right now and it's good
[3:57:12] <RupanSen> I saw Strippin was streaming it yesterday
[3:57:15] <%CalderGaming> it's really obvious that the God Eater team made it
[3:57:15] <mothdude> Shit's locked
[3:57:18] <%Bad1uck> locked out!
[3:57:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Came out the 20th
[3:57:20] <TheHeroAppears> @Lazyallaround I enjoy my anime to be slippery :^)
[3:57:20] <%StaceMcGate> keycard disc 2
[3:57:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> There are people like Valkyrie Aurora playing it now
[3:57:28] <+ElizzGlaster> @StaceMcGate i mean i have used the speed up and max damage in the 9 versions for grinding, or to progress a sidequest. Like the friendly monster sidequest since low encounter rates for them
[3:57:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> It makes sense it would be GodEaterish
[3:57:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> They're both Bandai Namco
[3:57:36] <%Archmortal> When I played the demo it felt like a 5 out of 10 on the anime scale and the focus mechanic made it an unimpressive 7
[3:57:40] <%Basch71> the way skills are set, feels like its geared to big strong weapons
[3:57:41] <ExpressNode> I think there was an article I read that it has a bit of Freedom Wars mixed with God Eater stuff
[3:57:45] <%Archmortal> or beta, not demo, whatever
[3:57:50] <%InugamiTheHound> they had a limited edition g-fuel for code vein but it was sold out
[3:57:53] <%Guardiansaiyan> Cry on Stream @AngriestPat
[3:57:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> man remake is going to be so good
[3:57:57] <%Basch71> so I'm rocking the Zweihander
[3:58:00] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Maximillian level emotional?
[3:58:09] <mothdude> Sad Reno isn't voiced by Axel anymore. That was always funny.
[3:58:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> old man cries over fictional japanese popeye
[3:58:21] <omen_setter> The Mako reactor remake music is crazy good
[3:58:24] <%Keyd00d> Why doesn't Code Vein come with a bottle of Code Red? Missed oppurtunity
[3:58:27] <Matt_Briner> Hey, so form an opinion on this game yet? Any good?
[3:58:31] <+Mortem_Gamer> So psyched for the remake
[3:58:38] <%StaceMcGate> you can get there with the tiny bronco
[3:58:41] <omen_setter> LUL
[3:58:41] <Novapulsus> @AngriestPat thoughts on the new SOLDIER guy?
[3:58:46] <%FrustratedAF> ff7r is gonna be sllliicckkk
[3:58:49] <DokiDokiGonzalez> blow your nose you dumb dumb
[3:58:53] <ミュウレ4242> wutai clan ain't nothin' to fuck wit'.
[3:59:04] <%Basch71> the only downside I would say is the framerate will kinda stutter in enclosed areas like caves
[3:59:05] <%Laecerelius> I don't care that much about FF7 and even I'm getting hyped for teh remake. It looks like a good-ass game.
[3:59:08] <%StaceMcGate> please no genesis
[3:59:16] <rhus> new SOLDIER guy makes mee nervous, last new SOLDIER was Gackt
[3:59:18] <+ElizzGlaster> @Keyd00d they got a gfuel flavor with a special shaker
[3:59:18] <mothdude> Yeah in the original Soldiers were just mooks.
[3:59:19] <King_thunder365> Didn't that new soldier guy kind of look like blonde Handsome Jack?
[3:59:20] <Aydarkzero> TINY bronco
[3:59:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Keyd00d It doesn't have a Code Red partnership. But it does have a partnership with Blood Banks. And Donating blood to the bank nets you a free copy.
[3:59:34] <%KoyFoster> I'm surprised how few people are streaming code vein.
[3:59:34] <%Keyd00d> Damn, didn't know that
