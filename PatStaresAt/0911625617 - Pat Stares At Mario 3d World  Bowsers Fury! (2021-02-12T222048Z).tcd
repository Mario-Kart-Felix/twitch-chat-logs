[0:03:01] <%Punchasaur> @PatStaresAt hey so i checked with my gf who trains service dogs (mine included) about the nylabone thing after looking into it myself. she claims they're safe. she does extensive research on this sort of thing and works for pretty renowned organizations so i trust her judgment. also my dog has been chewing nylabones for 3 years and is perfectly healthy. whatever you heard about nylabones being toxic is misinformation

[0:05:15] <derekwst3> Mario is a asshole normally
[0:05:18] <$SGrim> Cause he's wearing pajamas
[0:05:20] <+Gamblor69> That camera work reminded me of a PS1 game
[0:05:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> How is the tail moving?
[0:05:22] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Thanks for killing blowser now we can have our new president Wlowser
[0:05:24] <%asgard147> cos why not?
[0:05:24] <Mattais88> It's the hat brim under his kigarumi
[0:05:24] <%AnIcedCoffee> Mario canonically hates children
[0:05:24] <%Movemeister> monkaS
[0:05:25] <%vexion_smh> Mario is sassy af
[0:05:25] <$KnivesEve> he kinda is

[0:06:07] <%Punchasaur> @Punchasaur yeah i know, but i figured i'd at least make an attempt to educate him so i can say i tried. its important to me that people make informed decisions regarding pet health
[0:06:21] <rameiramaster> Clap
[0:06:47] <Broken_Sonex> @Punchasaur He did NOT read that block of text.
[0:06:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> LOOONG Piranha plant
[0:06:53] <%BoxNavy> moon2W theres too much
[0:06:55] <%Monkeyweed21> pat why
[0:06:56] <dan_g_v> like Yooka Layle?
[0:07:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat that is because you are insane.
[0:07:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Then get it
[0:07:03] <xeros720> ha, odyssey must've been maddening
[0:07:03] <%darklordfodder> I hope the next Mario is a bigger version of this.
[0:07:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Friendship ended with Yoshi. Now Plessie is my best friend.
[0:07:13] <KingVantq> 200 moons per level tdogSmile
[0:07:14] <+TheotherKristian> Anti goblin perks
[0:07:19] <%ssjklyco> That doesnt sound too bad, but that's more of a personal issue
[0:07:22] <shaddydaddyo> odyssey sux
[0:07:23] <mike2hands> TO MANY GOBLINS
[0:07:27] <+Cobaltor_252> mind goblins
[0:07:28] <%darklordfodder> I petered out on Odyssey quick
[0:07:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Odyssey is Pat Goblin crack
[0:07:29] <%BoxNavy> for me i kept getting moons in one level and then going to the next one when i had my fill
[0:07:32] <%Monkeyweed21> is it cuz you a psycho?
[0:07:33] <%cvp5127> yes
[0:07:33] <Profmcstevie> Odyssey decided to give you something for every mundane action, unfocused it's design a lot
[0:07:33] <Blank9> the unlockable moons were too much
[0:07:34] <+Rekinsinn> look under the level
[0:07:34] <xeros720> odyssey, 10/10 GOBLINS DISLIKE
[0:07:34] <ergulor> below
[0:07:35] <dan_g_v> already checked under the light house?
[0:07:37] <mr_saturday93> he wrong
[0:07:37] <KingVantq> doesnt odyssey have like 6k moons?
[0:07:40] <reonome> GOBLINS
[0:07:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Breaking news Pat hates Fun
[0:07:43] <Blank9> at the end when it just added new moons to old levels in random areas
[0:07:46] <%darklordfodder> Halve the number of moons, make them twice as hard to get.
[0:07:47] <+MooseIsGoose> I love mario odyssey
[0:07:49] <%BoxNavy> filler moons just to have a big number
[0:07:50] <marvel877> Mind goblins prevent you from enjoying a lot of stuff, huh Pat?
[0:07:53] <%Punchasaur> @Broken_Sonex i figured
[0:07:54] <jowi_time> AGREED
[0:07:58] <%SirGO0SE> having really shitty moons devalues the good ones imo
[0:08:00] <SainEdge> I'm happy i don't have this problem, i loved oddyssey. But yeah, it's to much
[0:08:03] <Profmcstevie> 60% or more of EVERY 3D Mario has garbage stars/shines/moons
[0:08:04] <@commanderclaw> It has poor distinctions between meaningful content and meaningless content
[0:08:05] <%CapnClassix> Sunshine is best Mario
[0:08:05] <zakaraz> odyssey is a good game but the number of moons just enflames the mind-goblin cancer
[0:08:05] <iceballstwitch> I loved the first playthrough until the end of the story
[0:08:06] <Mattais88> Did you look at the sky for 12 minutes
[0:08:06] <+AngriestAngryArtist> it turned into fucking assasin's creed horseshit
[0:08:08] <Zebroneath> The filler moons killed it for me
[0:08:09] <%darklordfodder> "Did you look left?"
[0:08:09] <%QueequegTheater> WHY THE FUCK I NEED SO MUCH MONEY
[0:08:11] <skrewarrior> did you sit on the lump
[0:08:11] <%Valdorick> "Look into the sky and 50 million light years away is a taxi, that's where the last power moon is"
[0:08:12] <%asgard147> They forget that in a game like this, people WILL want to collect everything
[0:08:16] <Jacob_Struggles> Hasving that many moons made getting them not feel good
[0:08:16] <%JD_Lars> The last cat coin was on the side of the building in a hole. You need the propeller hat to get it
[0:08:17] <mike2hands> looks like a banjo problem
[0:08:20] <xeros720> oh totally, it started to really ape other open world games
[0:08:21] <+Ham_Tyrant> I absolutely hate that he walk like a horrid cat man
[0:08:30] <%BoxNavy> hmmmm
[0:08:34] <dapperskeleton69> you straight up can just buy moons at the end of the game they give no fucks
[0:08:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Embrace the furriness @ham_tyrant
[0:08:40] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Has the stream died or am I craY
[0:08:43] <%BoxNavy> good one

[0:08:52] <%sleepy_coffee> psaDogchamp
[0:08:57] <xeros720> try refreshing, still seems fine

[0:14:30] <%asgard147> sure why not?
[0:14:31] <%KyoryUtchy> @FluffiTamamo Yeah, Nintendo has a bad habit of needing to reinvent the wheel. They might well go "Well we already did this gimmick with Bowser's Fury, so the next Mario game has to be something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT"
[0:14:35] <%BoxNavy> they did this with kirby
[0:14:37] <%SirGO0SE> wish they would do that with Metroid :(
[0:14:39] <skyentombment> I'm confused, is this just a demo?
[0:14:40] <%chiazam> I don't think this is that tho Pat
[0:14:42] <rameiramaster> Watch them not doing anything with this in the future
[0:14:42] <%darklordfodder> I'm excited assuming that's what this is.
[0:14:42] <+TheBitingIrish> You're so convinced
[0:14:45] <%luftraumm1> could it at all be nothing of the sort?
[0:14:52] <Paciboyy> why is it all cat themed
[0:14:54] <+Rekinsinn> You mean like when they put Captain Toad in the first release of this game?
[0:14:57] <ExpressNode> I guess not for Mario but they did with the Wind Waker demo I believe
[0:15:00] <+nicoleymcquack> A good dgd song
[0:15:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Not an optimal run

[0:21:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> The DBD devs put out a PTB with changes to the UI and survivor movement which were disliked, they ended up pushing them to live and received the same amount of backlash plus more. This is also a couple weeks after the lead game designer got shit on for telling colourblind people to go fuck themselves and that "they'll do colour blind settings when they feel like it"

[1:00:09] <+darklordfodder> Have you tried making him meow?
[1:00:12] <%0rond> than don't make him bark, isn't not barking a positive?

[1:00:36] <%Ranryu692> that sounds like a quitter's reasoning
[1:00:40] <%Ziegsy> Someone needs to send pat the bulldog minion in ff14
[1:00:41] <%SirGO0SE> yeah but look at Mario he's an eyetalian and he's a cat
[1:00:43] <Sotetsu> A well trained dog can meow on command.
[1:00:55] <%justcallmebobplease> I do kinda wonder how much money Pat could make studding Zangief out to viewers - like it's a terrible idea I'm not for it, but I wanna know the math - how much bank would a canine-morally-bankrupt pat make? And how many Zangief Jrs would there be?
[1:01:01] <%Ziegsy> I dont watch you play 14 mane
[1:01:05] <%Ranryu692> it is?
[1:01:07] <@SoFarFetched> he's posted it onto his twitter.

[1:03:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Watch Zangief become more horny without balls./
[1:03:57] <%THATGUY_789> Elmo*
[1:03:57] <kenny_biff> pat I just learned today that I can afford my #1 college of choice. Sucks right?
[1:04:04] <%ttc_lover> Isn‚Äôt 11 Months Way way too late?
[1:04:21] <%THATGUY_789> Elmo and Geif the Balless Bros
[1:04:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't liek this white outline around Mario's character model
[1:04:24] <%ttc_lover> Supposed to do it at or before six months
[1:04:26] <%topendbuzza> lol
[1:04:27] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:04:29] <@PeachSaliva> @ttc_lover Not for bulldogs
[1:04:29] <+smuggleruncle> that's level 1, level 2 is : make a dog collar from his balls FOR HIM
[1:04:30] <%QueequegTheater> His balls will grow too powerful
[1:04:33] <%ttc_lover> Yeah the hormones already take affect on their body
[1:04:33] <%Alazull> 11 months is the earliest you should
[1:04:34] <@commanderclaw> His balls will have become steel by then
[1:04:34] <iceballstwitch> the baby will be born from his balls by then
[1:04:36] <SomersaultJustice> his balls am become stone
[1:04:37] <%Ranryu692> if you wait too long, they grow back
[1:04:38] <%crimsonharvest> 'supposed' fuckin means nothing for this
[1:04:38] <$SGrim> The balls will have retreated inside by then!
[1:04:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It feels bad, like i'm looking at alpha or beta models
[1:04:39] <%topendbuzza> balls grow back pat Kappa
[1:04:39] <%damienlunas> His balls are too powerful to be removed
[1:04:40] <$velgaduere> no, by then his balls will be made of adamantium
[1:04:41] <@PeachSaliva> @ttc_lover 11 months at the earliest, but we will do one year
[1:04:42] <%KyoryUtchy> @Estuko The story is that Bowser Jr. called up CPT because his daddy drank too much no-no juice, but Mario showed up insted
[1:04:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT IF THEY GROW BACK?
[1:04:43] <%THATGUY_789> that's wen they mature
[1:04:43] <NeroInfinite> Depends on the breed yeah
[1:04:44] <gslayer14> they do it for hormonal reason too, right?
[1:04:45] <Mattais88> Not if you want to keep him a oprano
[1:04:46] <OldManDeckardCain> HIS BALLS WILL BE TOO STRONG
[1:04:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everyone knows the balls regrow if you don't get rid of them soon enough.
[1:04:50] <@PeachSaliva> really depends on the breed and sex
[1:04:51] <+Mr_Cyniic> I keep hearing the first few notes of the Harry Potter theme song
[1:04:51] <alextrebeken> but where will he store his pee
[1:04:52] <%NopeBadguy> if you snip off your testicles past a year, they just grow back Kappa
[1:04:54] <%THATGUY_789> become ripe
[1:04:58] <%ttc_lover> Huh
[1:05:03] <%CalderGaming> lotta alleged veterinarians in chat tonight
[1:05:03] <yourliteraldog> Why snip his sack he hasn't penetrated elmo yet or has he?
[1:05:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> TIL
[1:05:11] <%wibbwobbler> zangief like in street fighter
[1:05:13] <+FoolsArcade> There is no "too late" for spay/neutering. If anyone tells you its "too late" they're lying and shaming you. There is only too early
[1:05:15] <+bluedude153> nice stewie impression
[1:05:18] <%damienlunas> Bone Juice is stored in the balls
[1:05:20] <%bhp_99> his balls will become a boss fight for the vet
[1:05:28] <%THATGUY_789> Ballsers Fury
[1:05:34] <@PeachSaliva> @yourliteraldog Its the responsible thing to do since we don't plan on breeding him and it's better for his overall health. Plus a lot of dog parks won't let him inside if he isn't neutered at the right time
[1:05:35] <$velgaduere> @yourliteraldog always spay and neuter your pets
[1:05:43] <%QueequegTheater> It really IS dark souls
[1:05:51] <+bluedude153> My friend has some kinda fancy ass labador where they have to wait 3 years
[1:05:57] <yourliteraldog> Noted
[1:05:58] <+bluedude153> no to late for spaying
[1:06:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> And almost no dog hotel/daycare will allow Dogs that haven't been spayed/neutered.
[1:06:09] <yourliteraldog> It is a good idea
[1:06:13] <powerprotoman> if you spin in a circle you can do a high jump
[1:06:13] <%Ziegsy> My dog wasnt spayed and she ended up with a uterine infection that almost killed her.
[1:06:15] <+Conzanagi> Can you control Jr in any capacity?
[1:06:16] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt dunno if it matters, but you're not streaming under a game category on twitch. It's just blank.
[1:06:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, triangle jump dude
[1:06:22] <%ttc_lover> @foolsarcade Isn‚Äôt it to prevent them from spreading around your house and be less aggressive as an adult?
[1:06:23] <Hellvis92> Like with seath's cave
[1:06:30] <BoxFaceStar> Hi paige! how's your you
[1:06:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> that's a good game design right there
[1:06:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Neutering a dog also helps with alot of behavioral issues that might ooccur
[1:06:48] <%THATGUY_789> I like the fireball is like echo location
[1:06:55] <LordOfThePoultry> can you crouch jump in this one?
[1:06:55] <+ringabal> @PatStaresAt Ground pound to see the platform
[1:06:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> woopsie doodle
[1:06:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe the platforms get shown in the Bowser rain?
[1:06:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Long jump towards the shine?
[1:07:19] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> you can ground pound
[1:07:24] <Shwepie> Just ground pound platform.
[1:07:25] <@SoFarFetched> Oh pat no category is set apparently, I refreshed and it doesn't show for me.
[1:07:30] <+FoolsArcade> @ttc_lover that has nothing to do with time really, but spay/neutering has many effects and reasons for doing such
[1:07:42] <%Punchasaur> a jump in a mario game??
[1:07:43] <@SoFarFetched> chichen pointed it out.
[1:08:00] <$velgaduere> star not so useless anymore!
[1:08:06] <%SirGO0SE> I felt really sad getting my dog spayed but its been 3 weeks and shes back to her normal self already, healed really nicely too :)
