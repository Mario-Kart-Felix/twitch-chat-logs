[2:10:45] <TechDragon_Z> To be fair it had more assets to pull form
[2:10:46] <$TallYoda08> PogChamp
[2:10:47] <%iosephe> They were definitely able to reuse assets\
[2:10:48] <Lunatyr_> Disc Room only got 1 room :(
[2:10:49] <+senfood> It has its own skybox!
[2:10:49] <%ElkRiverDog> Yes but have you tried bacon cheeseburger pizza???
[2:10:49] <%dukenux> It's JUST shadow warrior
[2:10:49] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt it like they could just use assets they already developed for the game, or something. 4Head
[2:10:50] <+redthebaron> they know their engine
[2:10:51] <%Ynkubus_> check for worm
[2:10:53] <%optimasmaximas> WATERFALL GIRL? PogChamp

[2:10:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Impossible both LUL
[2:10:54] <%StaceMcGate> Isekai
[2:10:54] <+CanonHusbando> yeah they totally just threw some existing assets together
[2:10:55] <%ConLin_Arts_> BOOOOOO
[2:10:56] <%dinnydanny777> - EXPLORE SHADOW WARRIOR 3
[2:10:56] <wix964> Soooo, is Shadow Warrior 2 any good?
[2:10:58] <%ThePuddingDead> is the bathing jpeg lady behind the waterfall!?
[2:10:58] <$dalmek> welcome... to the SHADOW WARRIOR DIMENSION
[2:10:58] <%Taisuru> To be fair they probably just cut out a chunk of a level from the game since this is built on it
[2:10:59] <%AzureGale> What about pizza burgers?
[2:10:59] <BlacSoul> They already had the assets
[2:10:59] <+BlakeLocked> Explore the Game
[2:11:00] <Coystick> Huu marns
[2:11:00] <Sol_Install> I trade irl booth for more of this kind of shit any day

[2:11:04] <delilah4you> nothing behind the waterfall? Fuck off
[2:11:06] <Macfine> Pat has clearly never been to E3
[2:11:07] <+Jaysky> This game is likely running on the engine
[2:11:08] <kulmoth> tbf they made this so they are allowed to show off
[2:11:08] <Sedrelic> boooo
[2:11:10] <%dukenux> Did SW2 have secret animu girls?
[2:11:11] <hat_under_bread> Yeah. Why make a bunch of new assets for a booth thing?
[2:11:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> This might just be a level they ripped and put into the demo with a big screen
[2:11:12] <HarraceHarrison> Pipe dog
[2:11:14] <%Nope80808> "How much this booth cost?" Nina: "Yes."

[2:11:26] <+CanonHusbando> makes sense with them building up to the SW3 trailer on their twitter and stuff

[2:12:45] <BoneofMalkav> The OG Game's great despite Old Lo Wang's voice. The Reboot's pretty good despite it being very Serious Sam-ish and the Sequel to the Reboot's a good looter shooter.

[3:32:28] <DillionPHCO> The Quint side quest alone
[3:32:29] <%heartlesshealer> It only feels different because you need money super bad now

[4:21:15] <%nimu290> punching works better i think
[4:21:18] <%heartlesshealer> could always punch
[4:21:19] <%walternatorz> on that dangerous dog*
[4:21:22] <%de1ete_forever> the bork buster 4000 also known as GUN
[4:21:22] <%Dementedpenguin> York filling up that endangered species list.
[4:21:25] <NadaPlays> Do those wild hell hounds appear at midnight again?
[4:21:26] <%ringabal> "I fired. Then I missed."
[4:21:29] <%Josef_Stryker> Snuff that rare pupper for a shine spark.
[4:21:31] <%iosephe> snuff these puppers
[4:21:32] <%heartlesshealer> 1 bullet + 1 punch takes out the dogs
[4:21:32] <arkv01> SWERYs been playing too much monhun
[4:21:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Rare pupper snuff
[4:21:35] <%JumboCrunchies> Pat this is a neigbourhood. These are clearly people's pets.
[4:21:36] <%Emperor_Machinus> Rare albino dog, must kill
[4:21:36] <Zebekis> Agent Francis "Borkbuster" Morgan
[4:21:37] <$LuchaDePucha> is the blood money worth all these dogs lives
[4:21:39] <Ragnakawaii> This game somehow looks less polished than the first lol
[4:21:40] <%kewlmyc> I didn't know this was Last of Us Part II. Kappa
[4:21:41] <Torivore> Push the gun forward while shooting dogs to improve bullet velocity
[4:21:42] <SpoofSniper2> OK why is the first thing i see of this game is Pat becoming the ATF
[4:21:42] <robbtre> That was the Kimba of the dog world
[4:21:43] <%beansoup> ResidentSleeper
[4:21:48] <+OwlLightningMage> That was the Last of That Rare Dog
[4:21:51] <TheDewdHole> @PatStaresAt Is this senseless killing of God's creatures better or worse than DP1's shooting combat?
[4:21:52] <callsigneagle01> hooooo
[4:21:54] <+Link232> So why does Deadly Premonition suddenly have MMO "go kill X creatures" quests, or is this a stupid question
[4:21:54] <RorschachAttack> THE FPS IS SO COPPYY
[4:21:57] <%Josef_Stryker> H O U N G A N
[4:21:57] <disflipmat> Just all me Buster York. It's what everyone calls me.
[4:21:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes, him
[4:21:59] <Ultimatefool> Sick jump
[4:21:59] <%EyeFarted> this game is so dumb
[4:22:01] <SpoofSniper2> and Now hes Tony hawk
[4:22:02] <%WhereIsWill> he cant keep getting away with it!!!
[4:22:03] <startstoprepeat> houngan
[4:22:03] <%XenoDandelion> you made half the bee money in less than 30 seconds
[4:22:03] <+Nobrev> bork buster more like YORK BUSTER
[4:22:04] <%dinnydanny777> This is really just an RPG
[4:22:06] <%spiritofmojave> who?
[4:22:11] <%dinnydanny777> This is just an RPG
[4:22:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> half way to total extintion
[4:22:15] <nzrai> yeah and?
[4:22:16] <SpoofSniper2> Man they really stepped up from the first one
[4:22:17] <zenith0111> QUICK GIVE SWERY ALL YOUR MONEY
[4:22:18] <@SoFarFetched> its more interesting when people come in here going "WHO THE FUCK IS ZACK?"
[4:22:21] <narusao> it's a feature
[4:22:22] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's been worse than this at times too
[4:22:23] <%spiritofmojave> AND?
[4:22:23] <zenith0111> YOU LOVE IT
[4:22:24] <%eanscrale> It's more cinematic this way
[4:22:24] <%Xatekken> Silky smooth fps. I dont know what they are talking about.
[4:22:24] <FelixQuinnNoir> "the fps is bad" Oh you poor summer child
[4:22:24] <SatoruMasamune> PATTY "KILL 'EM ALL" BOIVIN
[4:22:27] <Maverick2736> I love how effortlessly he skateboards through grass and dirt
[4:22:28] <%dukenux> Isn't it better than last time?
[4:22:29] <+gergleboss> It looks better than yesterday tho
[4:22:31] <MisterVantes> And I'm over being like LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:22:31] <+Infernal_Dalek> I'm kind of disappointed so many people WANTED bad fps; like it's becoming ironic hipster to enjoy shitty performance.
[4:22:32] <KoyaMusa> neil druckmann wishes he could make something as good
[4:22:36] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> who tf needs FPS in 2020 not me
[4:22:36] <Torivore> That doesn't make the fps ok, Pat
[4:22:36] <OldManDeckardCain> fps is low, but each frame is pure quality LUL
[4:22:38] <%DappercatEsquire> I guess we all finally know the answer to the eternal question posed by Dead Island: Who do your voodoo?
[4:22:38] <Desertfishing> nah this is top tier frames they only framerate trolled
[4:22:39] <%nimu290> its meant to be powerful
[4:22:39] <omen_setter> it's cinematography
[4:22:40] <%XenoDandelion> Hey guys is the fps bad or is it just me?
[4:22:40] <%Daxalog> Does punch more damage?
[4:22:44] <ToneBacas> feels like Fallout 3 shooting
[4:22:46] <disflipmat> Watch this get a PS5 release in a couple years and it somehow runs worse
[4:22:46] <zenith0111> @infernal_dalek EXACTLY
[4:22:47] <chambatron> FrankerZ FrankerZ
[4:22:49] <UndeadManatee> you get a whole frame every second in this game
[4:22:49] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, framerate is better than yesterday, unfortunately
[4:22:49] <%dukenux> yeah, yesterday it was a slideshow
[4:22:51] <$LuchaDePucha> gotta kill em all
[4:22:53] <%beansoup> wait you mean it gets worse than this?!?

[4:26:54] <Dr_Mooose> SourPls
[4:26:54] <Ipsenscastle> There are hundreds of FBI agents out there shooting dogs right this second
[4:26:54] <SpeedyCloud17> oooooooh i saw it
[4:26:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> the music is pleasant
[4:26:55] <%de1ete_forever> i get more authentic enjoyment watching Pat play this game than the dozen other games i played that came out this year combined
[4:26:55] <Jaller101514> that good
[4:26:55] <%spiritofmojave> as it should be
[4:26:55] <%dinnydanny777> This area would actually look nice for an N64 game
[4:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'd seen it
[4:26:57] <+Infernal_Dalek> Don't you need to shower?
[4:26:58] <%beansoup> ooooh game loading
[4:26:58] <%EndsvilleArcade> This is... kind of incredible. I missed DP1 when it came out, but it looks like a sequel-ass sequel if ever I saw one.
[4:26:59] <%heartlesshealer> buildings gotta load in suddenly
[4:26:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> We will only be able to see the inbetween frames once we get more insight
[4:27:00] <+KityLinn> beautiful framerate
[4:27:01] <%dukenux> Was DP1 open world like that?
[4:27:01] <critiquequartz> I love all the people in chat who have actually lived in south screaming “I KNOW THAT BRIDGE” or “IVE MEET THAT OLD LADY!” And “No gators actually move that fast.”
[4:27:02] <Desertfishing> chug a lug
[4:27:07] <%XenoDandelion> why'd they make the map so fucking big
[4:27:10] <%Joustar_> Patti just HOOFING it behind York
[4:27:12] <%spiritofmojave> this glorious pop in YES
[4:27:13] <arkv01> yeah theres gotta be a deeper meaning to all this pupp snuffing, swerys a goddamn buddhist priest
[4:27:14] <+someguy1472> Pup Snoofing
[4:27:14] <%TsunamiPoro> the lower framerate makes me like the game more
[4:27:18] <+jiggy_snipe> the FBI has a pupper snuffer operation that is secret
[4:27:18] <%spiritofmojave> I live for all this jank
[4:27:21] <%mans51> I'd rather take 29 odd characters from this game as teammates than the average LFR player
[4:27:22] <penitentpentwitch> They're good sprinters
[4:27:24] <zenith0111> @de1ete_forever Whoa such a unique perspective Kappa
[4:27:30] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 but he isn't saying that people have to like it, he way talking about how funny it is new people keep mentioning the framerate.
[4:27:35] <narusao> snuff those pups
[4:27:36] <robbtre> The Jank is life
[4:27:38] <%Reaped_Psyche> Shooting random dogs for no reason. Just like real US police.
[4:27:40] <3Xgilly> chillin with titianfall 2 PC while watching the grind
[4:27:40] <+KityLinn> one frame..haha.. two frames...haha.. three frames!
[4:27:42] <tinyknot> why D:
[4:27:44] <Ultimatefool> I wonder why your stamina in this is so low when DP1 had a MASSIVE bar
[4:27:45] <Shwepie> Gators do actually move that fast, watch out.
[4:27:47] <Buka_Zero> just out here snuffin puppers
[4:27:52] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt is killing dogs how you unlock the rocket launcher
[4:27:53] <%kewlmyc> Imagine going to a park and seeing a FBI agent just shooting dogs to death
[4:27:55] <%DappercatEsquire> WELCOME TO DIE
[4:27:58] <nzrai> we hit the jackpot sir
[4:27:59] <%XenoDandelion> it looks like the dogs say "YIKES!" when they are snuffed
[4:28:01] <+yalrainne> wild dogs in a fence
[4:28:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Sboot from the fenxe?
[4:28:01] <arkv01> wait they're inside the fence, that's not wild...
[4:28:02] <narusao> it's a farm! they're farming dogs
[4:28:02] <zenith0111> @floralkami Yes because that's all that's happening like 90% of the time
[4:28:03] <+Taglog7> LET ME IN
[4:28:03] <DillionPHCO> Are those wild? They're in a fence
[4:28:03] <%TomFrancis_> are the really wild if they are fenced in?
[4:28:04] <Karneth_Khorne> Kill them all peter!
[4:28:05] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt How long do you think your going to stream for? I might order a pizza
[4:28:06] <%heartlesshealer> Gators are actually fast when they wanna be on land. They just don't like running so they won't do it often
[4:28:08] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't think those dogs are wild, they're fenced in
[4:28:09] <Ipsenscastle> these look like African wild dogs
[4:28:09] <%kyh9> PETA will hear about this
[4:28:10] <%Afterman_> @kewlmyc sounds like america to me
[4:28:12] <$scallycap> theyre literally fenced in

[4:28:18] <%Stonebeard> "Wild dogs"
[4:28:19] <%EyeFarted> IS YORK COLLECTING DOG PARTS FOR HIS REALISTIC FUR SUIT?
[4:28:21] <zenith0111> @floralkami Some basic mob grinding and horrible frame rate
[4:28:22] <+KityLinn> dogs have no rights
[4:28:23] <$scallycap> these are DEFINITELY someone elses dogs
[4:28:23] <SpeedyCloud17> The wild dogs are penned in LUL are you sure they're wild?
[4:28:24] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 as in you can tell people are new to the series (or Swery in general) by those comment.
[4:28:25] <DillionPHCO> Oh no
[4:28:25] <noyman2000> Never seen someone so excited shooting them wild dogs
[4:28:26] <+caffienatedjedi> Are we sure that we aren't playing as the ATF?
[4:28:26] <+jiggy_snipe> York is murdering pets D:
[4:28:26] <%Afterman_> @kyh9 peta will applaud him for killing the dogs so quickly
[4:28:28] <%EndsvilleArcade> dude, holy shit

[4:28:31] <olaksi> Now York is exactly like a real cop
[4:28:31] <+HotBloodedHero> YORK I said the Wild dogs! Why were you at the dog park!?
[4:28:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> York is so insane he could just be at a dog park and imagining that they are wild
[4:28:33] <critiquequartz> @shwepie I’ve lived in Florida I know
[4:28:34] <%miguelrod777> I don't think those dogs are wild
[4:28:37] <%heartlesshealer> Francis York DeVille
[4:28:38] <FoolproofDread> TFW you break into someone's lawn to kill their "wild" dogs
[4:28:38] <%apolitenoob> "Skateboarding FBI Agent shoots dogs for $30 in a Louisiana-inspired town" was not on my bingo card for the year

[4:28:44] <%DappercatEsquire> "The skins are just so interesting" - York

[4:30:35] <%dukenux> Ghost of Toshiba
[4:30:37] <startstoprepeat> the original lp had you alternating this and last of us so it's almost perfect
[4:30:37] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 how? no one is saying buy or don't buy the game, and Swery def isn't a well known dev, for obvious reasons. just because something is funny doesn't mean it has to be an insult at others' expense
[4:30:37] <%zamzoph> a Japanese game about America and an American game about Japan
[4:30:38] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It would be the best
[4:30:42] <%TsunamiPoro> they are basically the same game
[4:30:45] <%heartlesshealer> probably
[4:30:53] <theanora1> Gonna be great if about midway through York shows up and just tanks the frame rate
[4:30:53] <$LuchaDePucha> both games are the same in quality
[4:30:54] <+xerotwo> Ghost of Massachuchu LUL
[4:30:55] <%Niney_Who> OH NOOOO
[4:30:57] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Didn't a AAA game come out in the middle of the DP1 LP?
[4:30:57] <%AzureGale> When do you unlock the BFG
[4:31:00] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt are you ever going to be able to drive a car?
[4:31:00] <%beansoup> oof
[4:31:03] <BleedinActionMan> I think the Voodoo shop also sells guns
[4:31:03] <penitentpentwitch> Hit up the Voodoo shop later to check for upgrades?
[4:31:04] <+itsmariabxch> Pog
[4:31:05] <OldManDeckardCain> DRINK EVERY TIME HE MENTIONS HOUNGAN

[4:31:06] <Shwepie> Premonition of Tsushima
[4:31:06] <twieetcha> Serious question pat, would you ever try out paper Mario like woolie and stream it? Do you have a rule where you don’t usually do nintendo games?
[4:31:07] <+HotBloodedHero> You know, if the framerates
[4:31:07] <%beansoup> that was a bad angle
[4:31:07] <secretbosssauce> BONUS
[4:31:07] <%heartlesshealer> bead
[4:31:13] <%dukenux> @PatStaresAt i don't know, you think Ghost of Tsushima can really stand up to this?
[4:31:15] <zenith0111> @floralkami I have no idea what you're on about LUL All I'm saying is the game is shit and I love it
[4:31:17] <%spiritofmojave> Bonus UFO PORNO
[4:31:19] <SpeedyCloud17> his car got stolen
[4:31:20] <Ultimatefool> @BleedinActionMan Amazing sentence

[4:31:22] <%heartlesshealer> 100% board health
[4:31:23] <ArcOfDeath> i dont think this game could handle a car
[4:31:23] <Dok_Hope> the fuck is this frame rate
[4:31:24] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 and remember, this is the guy that likes Death Stranding.
[4:31:26] <+someguy1472> Why UFO?
[4:31:27] <%Garthunox> SICK JUMP FIDDY
[4:31:27] <DillionPHCO> The game barely runs not in a car
[4:31:29] <@SoFarFetched> He said in the beginning that his car got stolen and someone gave him a skateboard.
[4:31:30] <+ATentacleMonster> Can't do kickflips in a car dummies
[4:31:30] <%Niney_Who> YEYEYEYE
[4:31:32] <%AzureGale> I didn't notice SHIT, Francis
[4:31:32] <bluebiscuit94> !uptime
[4:31:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 31m.
[4:31:33] <OldManDeckardCain> DO NOT UPSKIRT THE CHILD
[4:31:39] <robbtre> Cars are a thing of the past! Skating is the future!
[4:31:40] <%Treuan> No car, only skate
[4:31:40] <+kapcommunist> was the devolver showcase good?
[4:31:41] <+professormorrigan> hey me too
[4:31:43] <+itsmariabxch> monkaS
[4:31:43] <%heartlesshealer> did you run over a bag????
[4:31:47] <%DappercatEsquire> I swear Pat said that he looked forward to DP1 more than some recent AAA game that came out during the first game's LP
[4:31:48] <zenith0111> @floralkami And anyone whos says "They don't get it" for people not liking it are being hipsters
[4:31:49] <Meekest> What was that
[4:31:51] <Sol_Install> yes it was good
[4:31:52] <noyman2000> Something popped
[4:31:54] <%StaceMcGate> @SoFarFetched right but in the first one you could borrow other peoples cars
[4:31:55] <+inopss> Yes
[4:31:55] <alexandrecau> did they arrested bigfoot yet
[4:31:56] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 I thought you were seriously trying to call Pat out for being some elitist hipster
[4:31:58] <%bread_assassin> I have a feeling the developers only introduced the skateboard, because the game couldn't handle being able to go like 50mph in a car.
[4:32:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> This game is running at a negative frame rate.
[4:32:00] <+HotBloodedHero> If the framerate were at a stable rate, I'm certain the skateboard would almost be too fast
[4:32:01] <+ATentacleMonster> I can't wait for you to learn tricks PogChamp
[4:32:02] <+jiggy_snipe> @zenith0111 sounds like you agree with Pat and the rest of chat, this game is bad but it has a certain charm
[4:32:03] <+TheyTookMyBeard> HEY SMASHER, leave that kid ALONE!!!
[4:32:06] <%AzureGale> She's wearing shorts, it's cool
[4:32:06] <chronoxgp> jus f**** kill me already
[4:32:08] <%heartlesshealer> WAS A UFO SPAWNING OUT OF THE GROUND???
[4:32:09] <@SoFarFetched> @StaceMcGate no they want to indirectly promote tony hawk
[4:32:10] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 it's a joke, bro
[4:32:11] <Vaun0x> boy, I sure am excited for ghost of tsubasa oribe
[4:32:17] <%TsunamiPoro> omg the framerate is so nice in here what the FUCK
[4:32:17] <TheDewdHole> @PatStaresAt I genuinely want to know this game's budget
[4:32:17] <+kapcommunist> @Sol_Install nice, ty
[4:32:22] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Not much plot today, just bees
[4:32:25] <Sol_Install> np!

[4:32:37] <%StaceMcGate> literally Tony Hawk's Existensial Nightmare
[4:32:37] <Sol_Install> one of the five
[4:32:37] <+Moxhasan> the balloons are fast travel as taxi so technically you get into a car
[4:32:38] <zenith0111> @floralkami Is that not true? LUL I mean... I've watched him since Machinima and... what that's not true?
[4:32:39] <alexandrecau> bees and plot are the same
[4:32:41] <Prevot> of course it was a cop who wanted all those dogs dead
[4:32:42] <%EndsvilleArcade> You must collect the beads, five. To truly vibe.
[4:32:43] <SpeedyCloud17> HEY THERE MIS-
[4:32:44] <%DappercatEsquire> My favorite part is that Melvin's badge is sewn in
[4:32:47] <%michingmallecho> Bees?!

[4:33:28] <%ringabal> I hope those beads end up giving Pat an infinite Machine gun
[4:33:29] <%Garthunox> I drive a Chevrolet movie theatre
[4:33:30] <therakishsage> Hey @PatStaresAt this might be a very silly question, but when is this game happening, in relation to Deadly Premonition 1's plot?
[4:33:30] <zenith0111> @floralkami Dude was calling people who liked the share button idiots LUL he's pretty elitist and that's why people love him
[4:33:38] <FoolproofDread> No, Pat, that's a lot of CONTENT. Shut up.
[4:33:39] <chronoxgp> frame by frame
[4:33:49] <%floralkami> @zenith0111 naw. An elitist hipster would tell people they should feel bad for not understanding something. Pat is a person who says "my taste is shit, and I eat it up."
[4:33:50] <chronoxgp> every step
[4:33:59] <oneimportantthing> Show me ya frames
[4:33:59] <%DappercatEsquire> I am still struggling to do the mission after the gator murder, because I can't be fuckin bothered, it's so tedious
[4:34:01] <penitentpentwitch> Exploration? Stream doesn't have time for that!
[4:34:09] <%Garthunox> @zenith0111 calm down, you two are taking this a bit far guys
[4:34:11] <BleedinActionMan> @therakishsage this case is 5 years before, I believe

[4:34:27] <+ATentacleMonster> LOL

[4:34:27] <%de1ete_forever> 30 is too much

[4:35:41] <startstoprepeat> one lollipop, two lollipops, three lollipops, houngan
[4:35:46] <%heartlesshealer> @therakishsage Game is a prequel in the same year as the first one, but being told as a flashback story at least 15 years after the end of the first game.
[4:35:47] <King_Kth> Man this framerate is dogshit and I love it
[4:35:48] <%dinnydanny777> This game really just is an RPG

[4:50:08] <+AnthraxJohnson> Holy fuck he gets some speed on that board
[4:50:08] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> @Monkeyfistaroo The appeal is so bad it's good, plus the first game had a genuinely good story and ending
[4:50:09] <$scallycap> @PatStaresAt your gun was originally power=1, you got +2 power so now youre at power=3
[4:50:11] <%Dementedpenguin> This game is legit reminding me of Virtual Hydlide.

[4:50:13] <%DetroitSentai> you can hit + to stop dialogue
[4:50:16] <Royalguard22> I dropped in to see if the framerate was really as bad as people say and jesus christ.

[4:50:58] <%medusasghost> i'd watch prob
[4:50:58] <huskarl_zap> nah miss me
[4:50:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Super depends
[4:50:58] <moonmintparadise> Horizon Zero Dawn with mods
[4:50:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:50:59] <Vaun0x> we're here for YOU, pat
[4:50:59] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah but Death Stranding had memes
[4:50:59] <%de1ete_forever> horizon, big yes
[4:51:00] <flyingtentaclemonster> I personally dont like those
[4:51:01] <%BinaryFireball> If it's Yakuza it's great
[4:51:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Depends on the game but I generally like sidequests
[4:51:01] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Id love to see you play Horizon
[4:51:02] <callsigneagle01> I like GoT but I'm a history autist so it's unique to me
[4:51:02] <%Joustar_> depends on the level of banter YOU provide Pat
[4:51:02] <SaltyGuyMan> at least that had Kojima bullshit tho
[4:51:02] <%WhereIsWill> guess it depends on game n streamer
[4:51:02] <+textandnumbers> people just wanna watch pat be pat
[4:51:04] <%optimasmaximas> i can witcher all fucking day
[4:51:04] <%Reaped_Psyche> PLEASE PLAY HORIZON YES PLEASE PLEASE
[4:51:04] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Why don't you put out a poll?
[4:51:05] <%BigCoffee> maybe, depends on which game you pick up
[4:51:05] <%dinnydanny777> Yeah but Death Stranding's gameplay is open worlding
[4:51:05] <+dante_must_die_exe> not all open world games can be DP2
[4:51:05] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt I'll watch whatever at this point
[4:51:05] <gimmickypizza> you going to have to be a little bit more engaging Patrick
[4:51:07] <$The_AngryHoogs> Depends on the game
[4:51:07] <reallybutchmane> if it has hyoe around it people will watch
[4:51:07] <$Caped_Eggy> Death stranding was very narrative tho
[4:51:08] <%spiritofmojave> Horizon might be fun
[4:51:08] <%optimasmaximas> other games no
[4:51:08] <%Agami23> i could care less. as long as its a game i dont plan to play i will watch a stream of it by you
[4:51:08] <%Treuan> That'd be fun
[4:51:09] <penitentpentwitch> Don't forget to buy a slot upgrade
[4:51:10] <+Yokuho> @PatStaresAt Whatever we tell you to do you will ignore and do your own thing, so do whatever I guess
[4:51:10] <ZAC415> depends on the commentary ans comedy
[4:51:10] <doggieo> Id watch Horizon
[4:51:10] <Diet_z_dan> Depends on the game and streamer
[4:51:11] <%코코꾸라> I care immensely
[4:51:11] <%Starotter70> To be fair, Stranding is ALSO a special case
[4:51:12] <%worldbrand> Horizon's sidequests will be way more predictable than Death Stranding, though
[4:51:14] <karl_rex> Depends how on into it the streamer is
[4:51:14] <gimmickypizza> The Witcher was super boring to watch
[4:51:15] <%sweetestbeefs> NO GRINDING ON STREAM THO
[4:51:15] <%lunaraci> Yeah but that's Kojima
[4:51:16] <ALTRNico> I treat this as a podcast so it doesnt really matter
[4:51:17] <+Moxhasan> I watch you, game is usually second
[4:51:19] <Profmcstevie> You have 1 slot
[4:51:20] <%DetroitSentai> you need mor slots
[4:51:20] <%optimasmaximas> id watch you play horizon
[4:51:20] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> @Monkeyfistaroo Yaas, this is The Room of vidya
[4:51:20] <penitentpentwitch> You have to buy a gun slot upgrade
[4:51:21] <secretbosssauce> It varies, though I think it mostly comes down to the streamer and how entertaining they are
[4:51:23] <zenith0111> Death Stranding had a good story at least
[4:51:24] <+MegaCorpltd> Something like GTA is boring as fuck to watch
[4:51:24] <+loukemia83> @patstaresat buy the expansion for slots
[4:51:25] <Meekest> You gotta upgrade it to equip both
[4:51:26] <%THATGUY_789> watch anything U put on to be honest
[4:51:26] <%toolofparanoia> death stranding stream was comfy as fuck!
[4:51:28] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[4:51:28] <+SH1NK1R0> You carried death stranding tbh
[4:51:31] <BluBox> Death Stranding was a bit of a special case too
[4:51:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Need more charm slots
[4:51:33] <ZAC415> you need another slot
[4:51:34] <bigshedman> RDR2 streams got lots of viewers and that game is slow as all hell, so I'd imagine it's more just people watching the streamer.
[4:51:34] <$LuchaDePucha> depend on the streamer
[4:51:36] <robbtre> I love chill grinding streams TBH. As long as the streamer is enjoying themselves.
[4:51:36] <%devanmuse> you can only have one right now it seems
[4:51:40] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat Mirage sessions no. Horizon yes. it's subjective
[4:51:41] <%mield916> I'll still watch GoT
[4:51:41] <%floralkami> JUST DON'T DO GTA
[4:51:47] <BalloniWright> Pat never played Horizon?
[4:51:48] <Torivore> If the game ABOUT doing sidequests? If so, then yeah
[4:51:48] <$scallycap> "dear voodoo, please make my gun better, amen"
[4:51:49] <BunnyEmperor> Death Stranding was interesting because of the Kojumbo effect
[4:51:50] <zenith0111> @megacorpltd Right? GTA gets lame super fast
[4:51:53] <%Cn_alpha_02> Hahahaha
[4:51:53] <alexandrecau> pargon pargon pargon
[4:51:55] <%Monkeyfistaroo> DO GTA
[4:51:55] <ahaegotrigger> Kreygasm
[4:51:55] <%Joustar_> Pat, you're the meat of the stream, the game is always just an added bonus.
[4:51:56] <%heartlesshealer> @PatStaresAt I very much depends on streamer. We watch because it's you doing it
[4:51:57] <gimmickypizza> GTA and Red Dead redemption are time vampires
[4:51:57] <%SharKinStereo> It has alot to do with how well you keep up your personality while you play, if you start going silent too much it might kill it.
[4:51:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> you need to unlock the slots
[4:51:58] <+SH1NK1R0> I’d say we give it a shot and just see how it feels
[4:52:02] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt First combat section has the mats for expansion
[4:52:03] <Royalguard22> Voodoo, like that Gabriel Knight game (if anyone gets that reference)
[4:52:03] <huskarl_zap> purple glockazine? poggers
[4:52:04] <%Afterman_> money and mats
[4:52:06] <%dinnydanny777> A lot of open world games have too much downtime
[4:52:07] <%StaceMcGate> You need the 2nd one
[4:52:07] <%toolofparanoia> i mean we got keep on keeping on
[4:52:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> sbfpSetIn
[4:52:12] <$Caped_Eggy> Anal beads
[4:52:13] <%heartlesshealer> pulcinella fragment
[4:52:14] <%DetroitSentai> The last item is from midnight enemies
[4:52:22] <+corrosivePaladin> fragment is something youll find as you progress
[4:52:23] <%worldbrand> low quality beads to do homework to
[4:52:26] <%DeluxeTitties> it depends on the commentary. If paige is there and the two of you can banter then yeah, the game essentially becomes background noise for a podcast
[4:52:28] <penitentpentwitch> Go grind them gators
[4:52:28] <+cubbywolf> whats our frame rate chat?
[4:52:29] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt You'll get the expand mats from a story section
[4:52:29] <+MegaCorpltd> Les beades anale
[4:52:30] <+kapcommunist> 0
[4:52:31] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Like the P5R streams, they're very chill streams
[4:52:31] <%BinaryFireball> sure
[4:52:32] <Diet_z_dan> ......
[4:52:34] <+zsDirtyHarry> Wrong
[4:52:34] <%XenoDandelion> hes gonna shit
[4:52:37] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Why don't you put out a poll for what games people like to watch you play?
[4:52:37] <%heartlesshealer> Fight red shadows for fragments apparently
[4:52:39] <%crimsong0ddess> no
[4:52:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> yes
[4:52:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> uhhhhh
[4:52:44] <%de1ete_forever> i'll watch Pat until the inevitable twitter meltdown, and even then, i'll keep watching
[4:52:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> You should probably read more carefully before making it load again
[4:52:50] <%Afterman_> will be very happy for ghost of stream
[4:52:58] <+Dirtiest_Bag> Is this plot even related to the original at all?
[4:52:59] <%afronooch> SUPER
[4:53:01] <%TomFrancis_> do whatever you want :)
[4:53:02] <sillylillybilly> I think open games make it less intimidating to follow every episode while encouraging streamer to interact with the audience during travel. Good background
[4:53:02] <%Monkeyfistaroo> I want him to do GTA purely because people would hate it and I like suffering
[4:53:02] <%DappercatEsquire> I will watch this to watch you suffer like I did
[4:53:06] <+someguy1472> Pat will never have a twitter meltdown
[4:53:06] <%KenzBurp> We're never happy, though
[4:53:09] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt i would enjoy you playing tushima and horizon
[4:53:09] <Profmcstevie> The strat is to go for the Power and Range up with a Fire Speed down to create a sniper rifle
[4:53:12] <haitakaa> it'll never be good
[4:53:15] <RorschachAttack> RIGHT'
[4:53:16] <ZAC415> fight midnight enemies for fragments
[4:53:17] <KoyaMusa> keep it real
[4:53:18] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Remember Pat, open world games tend to model themselves after Ubisoft. Expect a lot of downtime
[4:53:23] <%trustycoyote> It really depends. If the player isn't excited, open world games can be rough to watch @PatStaresAt
[4:53:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Could poll twitter to ask how they feel about sidequests. Not that twitter polls are representative.
[4:53:27] <BunnyEmperor> I wish Ghost of Tsushima would come out for PC right away
[4:53:27] <%floralkami> @patstaresat do anything that ISN'T a Rockstar game, and I'll watch
[4:53:28] <+cubbywolf> my god the load times
[4:53:36] <%optimasmaximas> some open world games are broing to watch, others arent
[4:53:39] <%heartlesshealer> I agree with @sillylillybilly. Thankfully Pat does audience interaction nicely
[4:53:50] <oceanmatt> oh my goodness
[4:53:59] <%SharKinStereo> It's all about how you vibe with the game too, you vibed super well with Death Stranding
[4:54:00] <gimmickypizza> @ringabal yeah like CD project red did
[4:54:01] <+soluxius> Lots of downtime means lots of Pat Time.
[4:54:02] <flyingtentaclemonster> !uptime

[4:59:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I predict that in the future, this "internet" thing will get more advanced
[4:59:21] <+NotaryRotary> This game is so good
[4:59:22] <+G_Thunders> “Wherever you are, so long as it’s at one of these specific balloons.”
[4:59:23] <AxelCezar> why not? why don't experiment new mechanic?
[4:59:23] <%dinnydanny777> But she had a hat
[4:59:24] <ItIsSky> the balloons
[4:59:29] <startstoprepeat> this game's already confusing enough without skipping tutorials
[4:59:29] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I miss her
[4:59:30] <+cubbywolf> it was just a Y vern tutorial
[4:59:40] <+ATentacleMonster> Speed Witch :(

[4:59:45] <+rottingpastry> lol

[4:59:50] <%floralkami> @patstaresat but her HAT, THO
[4:59:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt It helps for the album quest

[5:00:03] <%Starotter70> LUL
[5:00:06] <%dinnydanny777> What even triggered that cutscene anyway
[5:00:06] <re0killer> is the game like the way it is or is it actually 10fps
[5:00:12] <%spiritofmojave> nice LUL
[5:00:13] <+cvp5127> cowards
[5:00:14] <+rottingpastry> Fast travel does indeed trigger a world reload. You have to do it sometimes to recover hud functionality lol

[5:00:15] <+corrosivePaladin> I wonder why
[5:00:15] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> POG

[5:01:03] <Zebekis> The confusion would be super on brand though
[5:01:04] <callsigneagle01> @bosssbatttle Woolie hated DP1. That's why we hate him
[5:01:05] <%Xelig> I sure as shit got confused since I missed the start of the stream
[5:01:08] <+soluxius> Other streamers don't know true art
[5:01:09] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> THEY DONT HAVE THE BALLS
[5:01:11] <+someguy1472> Woolie would die on stream if he was forced to pay this.
