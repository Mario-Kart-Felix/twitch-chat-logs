[0:00:00] <%XxBTExX> Take your pants off, and use them to carry your wet diharrea just so it doesn't touch the ground. Mid-wedding.
[0:00:05] <1matheuw> yeyeye

[0:01:14] <%Blucarot> League time baby
[0:01:15] <+CelioHogane> It's time for watching Pat play league while i play league to farm tokens for the event!
[0:01:28] <%XxBTExX> Has Pat ever played ADC? Seems like a role he should never try playing but fun to watch him fail at.
[0:01:34] <%C0baltCrusade> @VritraReiRei let's not forget, his ulti is a GOLDEN EXPLODING DDT
[0:01:37] <+cherrypiestealer> So is pat a League streamer now?
[0:01:39] <%StaceMcGate> Has becoming a league streamer increased viewership?
[0:01:40] <+CelioHogane> @XxBTExX yes

[0:03:05] <Katalist_> I don't like LoL but I feel like I need to see Pat playing it

[0:03:30] <tigerfang86> I need to watch pat experience the toxic for me
[0:03:32] <%StaceMcGate> Pat was the only person I watch excited about that LOL spinoff announced at the game awards
[0:03:38] <tigerfang86> it's like double layered vicarious experience
[0:03:43] <tigerfang86> double the power
[0:04:00] <%XxBTExX> So Pat went 2- 8 on his last 10 games
[0:04:06] <vingadivo> i want sett to stepp on me
[0:04:09] <%ogtrashwizard> ogtrashwizard subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:04:12] <%mield916> he should play some of those steam game festival demos, most are 15-30 minutes long.
[0:04:13] <+CelioHogane> @StaceMcGate he was more excited about Thresh than anything
[0:04:19] <1matheuw> if those announced league games are telltale style walking simulators im gonna choke a hoe
[0:04:27] <%rockcentuar> let"s ask when he gets on
[0:04:32] <%XxBTExX> Thanks @ogtrashwizard
[0:04:38] <+CelioHogane> @1matheuw one is a turn based RPG and another is an action platformer
[0:04:43] <%XxBTExX> Feel the despair, his mmr is probably in the Elo hell levels thus the toxicity.
[0:04:43] <+CelioHogane> neither are telltale "games"
[0:04:50] <Warbot40> Man, Pat's making me wanna jump back in...but League is such time sink.
[0:04:55] <%StaceMcGate> So Riot has made LOL spinoffs of fighters, shooters, rpgs, and chess?
[0:05:00] <+CelioHogane> Yes
[0:05:04] <+CelioHogane> well, no
[0:05:06] <SummonerMagno> virgin moba, chad railjack
[0:05:07] <1matheuw> is making in this case
[0:05:07] <+CelioHogane> he IS making them
[0:05:20] <+CelioHogane> Yet to release them
[0:05:21] <%XxBTExX> @StaceMcGate just waiting for the LoL MMO and Battle Arena
[0:05:24] <+CelioHogane> except the Card game that was on beta.
[0:05:38] <1matheuw> raijack is THE shit man its a shame the player base is kinda dumb
[0:05:56] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to 1matheuw! They have given 120 Gift Subs in the channel!

[0:09:49] <%NSwarmlord> You get tokens through your missions
[0:09:50] <%arancet> dont buy it, not worth
[0:09:51] <%Ipsenscastle> The good part was Geoff getting to hang out with Kojima
[0:09:51] <+Deko_> Yeah but with the pass you get more
[0:09:51] <%bevyrage> you gotta play like 4 then 10 games for tokens
[0:09:52] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat event, complete missions for rewards
[0:09:52] <stoccton> you get a certain amount from missions
[0:09:53] <gps309> Only for quests
[0:09:53] <+jorgamund> No Pat, you ARE the tokens
[0:09:54] <%C0baltCrusade> @AngriestPat it's basically a battle pass type thing for 1 month
[0:09:54] <TBFeric> run away from the mini buys pat
[0:09:54] <thetruthofyourbeing> DONT ASK QUESTIONS
[0:09:56] <segbas2004> better just ignore it
[0:09:57] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat You get some so that you want to buy more later
[0:09:58] <%SilentEric> You get tokens for quests. If you get a BATTLE PASS you get more tokens.
[0:09:58] <%absolutely_naught> 36 aint shit
[0:09:59] <%truesleepking> ist the league ver of a battle pass
[0:10:00] <%TheWinged7> i honestly couldnt say, i have been out for almost 3 years
[0:10:00] <%ComicLord> You get a useless amount of tokens without the pass.
[0:10:01] <+megaotter> tokens can be exchanged for goods and services.
[0:10:02] <%XxBTExX> You are gaining tokens as is when you complete shit
[0:10:02] <usurper_sos> the TOKENS
[0:10:03] <+CelioHogane> You need to GET PASS!
[0:10:04] <gps309> 36 only if you buy the battle pass
[0:10:04] <%Svanyr> oh god battlepass-esque shit
[0:10:06] <%XxBTExX> You can use them in crafting
[0:10:07] <BlackermanZX> These are the tokens you get if you get the pass
[0:10:07] <%ComicLord> With the pass you get a useful amount of tokens
[0:10:08] <@SSaryn> Ah fuck it probably nothing good anyway
[0:10:08] <gps309> yes u can
[0:10:08] <+BIumen> go to loot
[0:10:12] <SilverWolfX9> just consume more product
[0:10:14] <%goose_attack_almanac> You can gain tokens from missions. You get a limited amount for the event.
[0:10:14] <%MonsterEnvy> It's for skins and such
[0:10:15] <%XxBTExX> You dont have to hit the button
[0:10:16] <%linSP> thats not a good deal
[0:10:17] <%ComicLord> You use the tokens in your loot
[0:10:17] <%SilentEric> You can use the tokens
[0:10:18] <Mendin> Those are premium bonus tokens
[0:10:18] <Yubul> If you don't have the pass, then you only get tokens for missions

[0:11:52] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat those arent costumes
[0:11:53] <%1matheuw> its just a recolor
[0:11:55] <+Deko_> those are color swaps for skins you have to buy LUL
[0:11:55] <pectusumbra> that's just an alt color for a skin though
[0:11:56] <%Beough> is the sub anniversary thing glitched? cause it keeps telling me to share it even though I keep doing it? i really hope im not spamming it to death
[0:11:57] <%SilentEric> You want the cheap stuff
[0:11:58] <%XxBTExX> Just do missions and get the 200 points for mystery skins.
[0:12:00] <gps309> get orb or keys
[0:12:01] <BlackermanZX> You need the skin first for the colors
[0:12:01] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat those aren't the actual skins they are recolors for if you ALREADY OWN that skin
[0:12:02] <Mendin> Save for keys and ORB
[0:12:04] <%absolutely_naught> Pat since you have so few champs the only thing worth getting are random champ shards
[0:12:04] <+Dre_> what skins do you have in the "your shop"
[0:12:05] <+BIumen> one guy
[0:12:05] <%TheWinged7> they are recolours of costumes
[0:12:06] <%arancet> you might want champ shards
[0:12:07] <Sol_Install> those are skins
[0:12:07] <%SashaStarshine> THey are skin recolors
[0:12:08] <pectusumbra> a chroma is an alt color for a skin
[0:12:09] <%SilentEric> You can buy Blue Essence
[0:12:10] <%NSwarmlord> Chromas
[0:12:10] <gps309> Just a recolor if you own already
[0:12:11] <%rockcentuar> ORBs
[0:12:11] <vingadivo> GAT CHAMPION SHARD
[0:12:12] <+TheFakeBob> The BEST value thing is Champion Shard for 50 tokens
[0:12:12] <%segonian> segonian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! if I'm being honest, I have no interest in League. Still here to support you though.

[0:12:15] <PunishedMercer_> those are alt colors
[0:12:17] <+CelioHogane> YES YOU CAN, ORBS
[0:12:17] <Yubul> ORB
[0:12:17] <BlackermanZX> Chromas are recolors
[0:12:18] <%TheWinged7> they are literal palete swaps
[0:12:18] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat those are just recolors for other skins you have to buy to use
[0:12:19] <%bevyrage> they're chroma recolors
[0:12:20] <Sol_Install> alt colors yea
[0:12:21] <vingadivo> CHAMPION CHARD PAT
[0:12:22] <+Dre_> they are alt colors for the skins
[0:12:23] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat the only ACTUAL SKIN there is tthe one at the top for lee sin

[0:12:25] <%SashaStarshine> ORBS PAT
[0:12:26] <%MonsterEnvy> You can get costumes but those are just recolors
[0:12:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> All you can afford is Blue Essence
[0:12:28] <ristos237> theyre colors for skins
[0:12:28] <+nox_1980> colors for costumes
[0:12:29] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat FYI you can get about 300 tokens for free by doing the normal missions. I suggest getting the ORB as those have Skin Shards
[0:12:30] <%NSwarmlord> Chromas are different colorations of skins
[0:12:30] <pectusumbra> just get the stuff at the bottom
[0:12:32] <%SilentEric> You need the costume, then the chroma is an alt color

[0:17:51] <+Dracozombie5792> Doesn’t cost dust though
[0:17:51] <kruggalo> the skin you get is free, youd have to spend essence for them
[0:17:52] <Imsoverylazy> GAMBLE
[0:17:52] <%XxBTExX> only problem is you might get a skin for a champ you down own.
[0:17:52] <%QuadraticGravity> yes
[0:17:53] <ristos237> you can get skin shards for skins you already have
[0:17:53] <%1matheuw> you can get a higher tier skin
[0:17:55] <Bloodxb> yes and dont think are worth melting down
[0:17:56] <%moogleboy1984> typically, keep Legacy skins
[0:18:02] <%ComicLord> The permanent skin is also for champions you have
[0:18:03] <Finchit> SKins? you to young for that pat. its too early for you
[0:18:08] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat the mark next to the pics mean they are event exclusive skins
[0:18:09] <%SashaStarshine> Waterloo MF is ass
[0:18:09] <darkvergillll> You might get something good
[0:18:10] <ZE_Count> Hey Pat you play any of those demos Steam is offering?
[0:18:13] <+TheFakeBob> If you get Syndra, it unlocks and you can't disenchant the skin
[0:18:14] <Mr_Rakjo> ROLL IT
[0:18:16] <Mr_Rakjo> GAMBA
[0:18:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> So you can buy the character.
[0:18:17] <%TheWinged7> the joy of lootboxes
[0:18:17] <%ThatOneGameTester> it's better to save up 2k orage and then reroll the bad skins into free ones until you unlock a good one with the orange essence
[0:18:17] <%1matheuw> get used to it
[0:18:17] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat rerolling is good when you have skins that are normally worth less than 975 because ON AVERAGE you will get something better than the 3 combined
[0:18:18] <Yubul> Syndra is actually pretty fun/
[0:18:18] <%C0baltCrusade> here we go
[0:18:19] <%terribleusername> it's so you buy it

[0:19:26] <@JustinianKnight> I know some stuff now tho
[0:19:27] <%nmaten> get money like 15-20 farm is worth more than a kill
[0:19:30] <usurper_sos> BIG advice

[0:19:32] <ape_hawk> but youre always big pat
[0:19:33] <TheRageofAfrica> Hey Pat, have you seen Sett yet?

[0:19:38] <+anhero64> eat minion good
[0:19:43] <Imsoverylazy> 20 minions is worth more than a kill
[0:19:43] <%NSwarmlord> 15 minion kills is the same as a champion kill in terms of gold
[0:19:45] <cham52> hello big pat
[0:19:47] <%TheWinged7> go play yourself in game with Gragas

[0:31:33] <Finchit> Q is a dash bruh
[0:31:33] <AmericanaRed> OWL2019DVa OWL2019DVa
[0:31:33] <%C0baltCrusade> yeah
[0:31:33] <rnyeeeezus> charge it
[0:31:33] <usurper_sos> it is meta
[0:31:34] <%SashaStarshine> And the longer you charge the further you go
[0:31:34] <paradiseinfused> if that was me I def would have dided
[0:31:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> Her Q can be charged up
[0:31:38] <RadShiro> @AngriestPat you can punch through walls!
[0:31:39] <%VantomPayne> thats like the point of her character
[0:31:40] <%C0baltCrusade> most dashes go over walls
[0:31:40] <shiny_prinny> gotta charge and release
[0:31:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @pectusumbra I am shocked that I was actually half right.

[0:31:42] <BlackermanZX> you can charge it
[0:31:42] <+Dre_> only walls that are thin enough @AngriestPat
[0:31:43] <+swaggopotamus> charge the q for distance
[0:31:44] <ape_hawk> q is a charge move
[0:31:44] <+xmetalicdemonx> Monty Python "RUN AWAY"
[0:31:46] <%MonsterEnvy> Also you can charge the q
[0:31:48] <%1matheuw> you need to charge it up
[0:31:49] <KingGrimlock1> @CommanderSqueaks red is hp regen out of combat and true damage burn over time, blue is mana regen over time (not out of combat) and 10% cooldown reduction
[0:31:50] <%nmaten> always assume dashes go over walls unless they specifically say you cant
[0:31:50] <Lithdoran> Krugs?

[0:40:09] <%SashaStarshine> Ahri is squish, yi is slightly less kits
[0:40:10] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat A good way to fuck with enemy jungler is to kill the big rock but leave the little. Big one wont respawn til lil one dies, so jungler is forced to waste time killing lil one for minor exp
[0:40:10] <+Linearlinera> matchup dependent
[0:40:10] <ALazo> Someone explain to me how to jungle
[0:40:11] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat items and lvls
[0:40:12] <apolitenoob> Some people have items, some have wards, some have good skills to prevent ganks

[0:42:10] <%ButterMyBrisket> because he's pushed in
[0:42:10] <%freezydude> Hey Pat you can technically stunlock champions with a one two combo just by ulting and then hitting them with a quick Q, if you think you can burst them down right away.
[0:42:10] <usurper_sos> You need to level up
[0:42:11] <KreuzDrache> its a lot more engaging then other roles
[0:42:12] <KattyCitty> git yi

[0:47:29] <%NSwarmlord> What
[0:47:30] <zayasu> @AngriestPat use your ult first then Q them toward your team
[0:47:30] <+GrassCannon> hold tab to see timers for monsters
[0:47:31] <studleydoorite> inconsequential help :)
[0:47:32] <%1matheuw> nah
[0:47:33] <%galaxyswirl> no you wouldnt
[0:47:33] <%NSwarmlord> You were full hp
[0:47:34] <%SashaStarshine> Ult puts you behind them
[0:47:34] <ALazo> good job living pat
[0:47:35] <shiny_prinny> Q them in the direction of your team
[0:47:36] <usurper_sos> You should have been using Q
[0:47:37] <+chase959> smite tho
[0:47:37] <+CelioHogane> Nah
[0:47:38] <%Vegaburd> you? yes
[0:47:40] <Louie_Salmon> You can tank tower hits, its not instant death
[0:47:42] <Finchit> Your life is meaningless now. you are an ult bot
[0:47:42] <%DatGuyJimbo> @AngriestPat Dont forget to check enemy items you can get an idea of how strong they are
[0:47:42] <RetributionP> all you needed was to smite
[0:47:42] <%SashaStarshine> if you Q immediately after ult you knock them into your team
[0:47:43] <Imsoverylazy> He's better at Vi than I am, at the very least
[0:47:45] <+Kazooki_Kazami> should've used smite tho
[0:47:46] <uhaveachoice81> @scevda You tryna put your peener in that video game character?
[0:47:48] <%freezydude> He totally used Q
[0:47:49] <%WorldSoup5> monkaS
[0:47:49] <jordanstayshome> Q them into your team
[0:47:52] <KattyCitty> q IMMEDIATELY after ult
[0:47:53] <%freezydude> he should've Smited her.
[0:47:56] <+CelioHogane> BEFORE ULT
[0:47:57] <KattyCitty> pushes them backwards
[0:47:57] <%freezydude> Thats the real thing.
[0:47:58] <lordzarcon_> smite her
[0:47:58] <usurper_sos> Q into your team
[0:47:59] <%NSwarmlord> The tower is not going to kill you from full hp with like 2 shots
[0:48:00] <silverira> use your smite
[0:48:01] <pectusumbra> q pushes. push them into team
[0:48:02] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat they meant to use Q to get closer, you would have ulted closer to the lane
[0:48:02] <zayasu> @AngriestPat Q after using ult to knock them to your team
[0:48:04] <Tressing> Smite them Pat.. you can slow them..
[0:48:05] <TonutWasTaken> close the distance
[0:48:05] <KattyCitty> no INSTANT
[0:48:08] <KattyCitty> like the MOMENT its over
[0:48:10] <%bevyrage> he hasn't built the item to smite champions yet right? pretty sure that's red blade
[0:48:12] <Finchit> you didnt combo pat. You dropped the combo
[0:48:12] <shiny_prinny> you auto-attacked first
[0:48:13] <simulationbard> Get mord
[0:48:13] <%freezydude> Pat, you upgraded your smite to blue smite with your jungle item
[0:48:14] <+Deko_> USE Q TO GET IN RANGE
[0:48:16] <silverira> it slows enemy champions pat
[0:48:16] <%freezydude> It slows them down.
[0:48:22] <%bevyrage> good job

[0:48:28] <usurper_sos> You helped
[0:48:28] <%galaxyswirl> GOOD JORB
[0:48:29] <AFlyingTaco1> So my understanding of this game is that you go around killing minions and npc monsters to level up, before then moving on to assault the enemy's base, correct?
[0:48:29] <pectusumbra> that's what you do in this TEAM game, yes
[0:48:29] <%SlackerAlex> Pat helped

[0:51:09] <ape_hawk> if in fights use it on champs
[0:51:10] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat na you can smite people
[0:51:10] <Oleam458> As you build your Jungle itme you can use it on Champs
[0:51:10] <Buzzard42> @AngriestPat is there something wrong with your stream? Every time I tune in your screen is grety
[0:51:10] <Iggeh0> blue smite works on champions
[0:51:11] <simulationbard> Nah
[0:51:13] <yamikami13> it get kills
[0:51:13] <EndgameContent> The item you build upgrades it
[0:51:13] <KreuzDrache> it's on a fairly short cooldown
[0:51:13] <%Big_Dream> oh no
[0:51:13] <%SilentEric> Your item
[0:51:14] <+rabidclone> you're upgraded smite can be used on champions
[0:51:14] <%secretspud> Smite Champs is just fine
[0:51:14] <KattyCitty> only save smite if going for dragon
[0:51:16] <BlackermanZX> yes
[0:51:16] <+CelioHogane> YES
[0:51:18] <%DatGuyJimbo> always keep one smite up
[0:51:20] <apolitenoob> When it's upgraded, you smite people
[0:51:20] <ralphfromdk> the one you have also slows champs for catching them or running away
[0:51:22] <KattyCitty> or baron for that matter
[0:51:23] <smevvster> Your jungle item makes your smite hit people, blue is a slow, red is a damage over time.
[0:51:23] <+Scevda> RTFM
[0:51:24] <weirdmothgirl> Only smite champions and biig monsters
[0:51:24] <+chase959> and red smite
[0:51:25] <kruggalo> blue smite slows, red smite enhances damage against champs
[0:51:25] <+swaggopotamus> Your smite upgrades give your smite different properties.
[0:51:25] <%freezydude> Yeah, and its really good because it steals movement speed
[0:51:26] <%XxBTExX> You can use chilling smite to slow people down, easy to then follow up with a skill shot
[0:51:30] <usurper_sos> WHY
[0:51:30] <%Teintstein> F
[0:51:30] <+CelioHogane> BLUE SMITE SLOWS, RED MAKES YOU DO MORE DAMAGE
[0:51:31] <%galaxyswirl> why in the world does the guide say to build trinity force????
[0:51:32] <KattyCitty> LUL
[0:51:33] <stoccton> RUN PAT

[0:53:21] <bubuche666> Man if someone said to me that Pat would be streaming LoL in the future i would not believe it hahaha that's just epic guys i love it ^^ and don't worry Pat the learning curve is hard (especially in jungle)
[0:53:22] <weirdmothgirl> If an enemy tower kills you without you taking enemy damage the previous 10 seconds, the enemies dont get gold
[0:53:24] <%DatGuyJimbo> that mord is BIG
[0:53:25] <%Valdorick> Fuck'n oof

[0:53:43] <+Linearlinera> focus more on tanking
[0:53:43] <AFlyingTaco1> Don't worry Pat, you helped your team by dying first!
[0:53:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm shocked by how not Toxic his team is being.
[0:53:46] <%SashaStarshine> Yuuuu have øøøørned my attentån

[1:00:02] <%NSwarmlord> Be tankier than you are now
[1:00:02] <%freezydude> that's why blitz sucks.

[1:00:12] <shiny_prinny> you have to get a PICK on their squishy champions
[1:00:12] <%SashaStarshine> Go full tank and lock down high priority targets
[1:00:13] <Hellarussian> OH NO

[1:00:29] <usurper_sos> You are feeding him
[1:00:29] <ape_hawk> pat, you have no armor/magic resist
[1:00:29] <KattyCitty> he had more health than u, just less health percent
[1:00:29] <SheSquirreI> pat got touched
[1:00:29] <+killfrost11> your diveing first you have to know when to dive in make them use all thier cc skills and get in on them
[1:00:31] <simifu> int Kappa

[1:00:34] <levanluhh> Yo, haven't come here in a while
[1:00:34] <Rhinoprotoss> How do you not know what Morde does at this point
[1:00:35] <redrins> he's fed, cmon
[1:00:35] <usurper_sos> You need levels and armor
[1:00:35] <%DatGuyJimbo> would love to see team chat lmao
[1:00:36] <$FrogROOT> delicious
[1:00:37] <%wujak> thats was still kinda a lot. every black tick is 100 hp
[1:00:37] <%Albadabar> You gotta pay attention to levels pat
[1:00:39] <%Ne1son> Even at 1/3rd health he has as much as you do
[1:00:40] <%1matheuw> life steal is a fun mechanic for the whole family
[1:00:41] <%Birdigalore> I JUST KEEP TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN
[1:00:42] <levanluhh> Is pata actually liking LoL
[1:00:43] <AFlyingTaco1> Overconfidence is a fast and cruel killer.
[1:00:44] <itesket> Pat is a snacc
[1:00:46] <%freezydude> You definitely needed to build Defensively
[1:00:48] <Lozzu> You’re actually trolling
[1:00:48] <%Garthunox> vi is better built as a tank or off tank, off tank is half damage half tank, trinity isnt as good as it appears
[1:00:49] <%freezydude> after like
[1:00:49] <+TestAnon> wait that was morde?
[1:00:50] <simifu> I guess so LUL
[1:00:51] <Tressing> You could try and build magic resistance
[1:00:51] <%freezydude> the fifth death
[1:00:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @levanluhh He is, but this is the worst its ever been.
[1:00:59] <Hellarussian> underconfidence?
[1:01:01] <redrins> and you're so far behind that engaging most of the time would result in feeding
[1:01:04] <%freezydude> Trinity force is a huge luxury item
[1:01:07] <+Grayhammatter> 2/13, yikes
[1:01:07] <zepelinnn1> FAAAAAAARM
[1:01:08] <%freezydude> it's for when you're super ahead.
[1:01:13] <%ButterMyBrisket> your damage items do nothing when you're dead
[1:01:13] <%Albadabar> Just hang back and protect base until you get some levels
[1:01:13] <%Agami23> if anyone thinks pat is overconfident, its more like general bumbling
[1:01:14] <usurper_sos> Don't engage Pat, just farm
[1:01:14] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat makes this look really easy tho u guys
[1:01:15] <%galaxyswirl> you are easier to kill than the adc because of less health and tankiness since you have to face fuck to do anything
[1:01:16] <Rhinoprotoss> turret???
[1:01:17] <Katalist_> Pat the self proclaimed MOBA master
[1:01:18] <ShadeTheNovice> Just dont fight and farm minions
[1:01:18] <simifu> I need more woolie staring into space while pat is talking about lol LUL
[1:01:19] <%XxBTExX> You dont have to dive all the time. In this case you are behind so you should stack resistance and focus on keeping enemy team off your Mid and Adc
[1:01:19] <%freezydude> otherwise you'd just build something else.
[1:01:20] <+Scevda> At this point, Pat shouldnt exit base.
[1:01:20] <VritraReiRei> Top lane
[1:01:21] <%arancet> @AngriestPat basic starter combo on Vi is charged Q to start fight, get 1 auto attack in, immediately E for third hit to proc W passive
[1:01:23] <+zeronic64> pat winning yet
[1:01:25] <ShadeTheNovice> disengage every opportunity
[1:01:26] <%DatGuyJimbo> its just one of those games no changing or coming back from it now
[1:01:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Would it be wrong to say Pat should spend more time looking before he leaps?
[1:01:27] <%TheWinged7> apatBig DoritosChip DoritosChip DoritosChip
[1:01:28] <StefyRaRa> I miss that Q turn to E combo.

[1:01:31] <+chase959> mr boots probably woulda helped
[1:01:33] <@ShockzNDrawe> now I am crazy talk
[1:01:33] <shiny_prinny> when those enemy minions stack up like that, kill them
[1:01:35] <vingadivo> pat you NEED steraks on Vi you're have so litle health
[1:01:36] <BlackermanZX> Welp
[1:01:38] <EdHeng> minions are kicking his ass lol

[1:02:09] <%Thedoobiousone> its a tanky attack damage item
[1:02:11] <TBFeric> I had to call my dad, what'd I miss?
[1:02:12] <KattyCitty> steraks is RED GLOVE
[1:02:13] <+CelioHogane> THAT BUILD IS HORRIBLE
[1:02:13] <SheSquirreI> big red fist
[1:02:13] <%SashaStarshine> Steraks is the red hand
[1:02:14] <filialpails> just run into a group of enemies, that's a good strategy
[1:02:16] <%Zaxshimysham> this is a bad game and you should feel bad for playing it
[1:02:17] <+RealThiele> so at this point in the game what would be a decent health number?
[1:02:19] <Hellarussian> youre fine
[1:02:20] <%Ne1son> Steraks is the glove item
[1:02:24] <%freezydude> well Real
[1:02:24] <+CrimsonRedBlaze> RED GAUNTLET
[1:02:24] <NotLysander> No worries, its a bit late to change up now
[1:02:25] <Finchit> its fine bruh
[1:02:25] <%freezydude> He's level 14
[1:02:25] <Yubul> Sterak's is in your *** build
[1:02:26] <shiny_prinny> what does the recommended say
[1:02:26] <+zeronic64> stay with blitz it will click
[1:02:27] <KattyCitty> red glove
[1:02:28] <Lozzu> Reported
[1:02:28] <SauceyItalian> watching pat play vi feels right
[1:02:29] <EdHeng> nugACE
[1:02:29] <+Grayhammatter> GG
[1:02:29] <StefyRaRa> Def Steraks
[1:02:30] <%DatGuyJimbo> its situational
[1:02:30] <lordzarcon_> pull up a moba fire page on your phone
[1:02:31] <%galaxyswirl> the items its telling you to build for some characters are really bad
[1:02:32] <%XxBTExX> Blitz is fine but you need to learn when to change to recommended.
[1:02:32] <%SashaStarshine> That build is fine if you're ahead Pat
[1:02:33] <usurper_sos> Build Red gauntlet
[1:02:38] <+killfrost11> blits is fine its not the items
[1:02:39] <usurper_sos> GGs
[1:02:40] <%wujak> it doesnt really matter what you build when you are 2/14 you are probably going to lose
[1:02:40] <%1matheuw> gg top was fed
[1:02:42] <ShadeTheNovice> Your fine on items for now, you need to understand how to read the situation better
[1:02:42] <KattyCitty> GG
[1:02:42] <Xxenase> those items are pretty bad lol
[1:02:42] <Hellarussian> its less items and more gameplay
[1:02:42] <Rhinoprotoss> there's a search function
[1:02:43] <$psydaku> Someone should make a pat fails at league compilation, with komm susser todd as the bgm
[1:02:43] <%freezydude> Pat that builds for when you're ahead
[1:02:47] <Tressing> in a teamfight dive Ahri with your ult and exit with your Q
[1:02:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey, on the bright side, it can only get better from here.
[1:02:48] <redrins> yeah that build is assuming you're ahead
[1:02:49] <+Scevda> *** is unreliable narrator. There. That should be understood.
[1:02:50] <%amister3000> oh boy
[1:02:50] <%freezydude> If you're behind you're obviously gonna lose b uilding damage.
[1:02:50] <OToole42> big read meaty glove, gives hp, base damage, and a nice shield when you get bursted in fights
[1:02:51] <%DatGuyJimbo> you need to learn the items to know what fits best each game
[1:02:51] <AFlyingTaco1> Congration, you done it!
[1:02:52] <+NeonLight> Wait, Streaks is a glove? Ive played since it was a thing and never noticed ._.
[1:02:52] <simifu> If you are ahead, for sure. but behind might want to alter your build
[1:02:52] <lordzarcon_> the build order is wrong
[1:02:53] <%SilentEric> Vi stands for Veeeding
[1:02:53] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat Blitzgg doesn't take into account who's fed in a particular game so at this point it's starting to mislead you into building the wrong things
[1:02:55] <NotLysander> There should be a recommended build when ahead or behind, but it's been forever since ive used it
[1:02:55] <%Garthunox> yeah trinity isnt as good on vi as others
[1:02:56] <BlackermanZX> he cant see shit for the item shop
[1:03:00] <%Ranryu692> if you're dying a lot, go for defensive items first
[1:03:00] <KattyCitty> pat no honour
[1:03:01] <+tuchpi> 2/14 LUL
[1:03:02] <koolaid_kevster> if you can give then use your ult defensively like if someone is beating on one of your carries
[1:03:03] <iwa5h4ck3d> pat doesnt honor
[1:03:04] <VritraReiRei> Didn't honor FeelsBadMan
[1:03:04] <TBFeric> Was that still the first game? I had to go for a bit
[1:03:08] <%XxBTExX> In this case you wer behind and blitz is pushing you towards an offensive build that is only good when you are fed.
[1:03:08] <+napargonaga> It's funny, watching this game feels like learning DOTA 2 all over again. I have no clue what character does what.
[1:03:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TBFeric yeh
[1:03:13] <+killfrost11> that was alot of going in when you shouldnt of
[1:03:14] <%nmaten> you dont leave on vi
[1:03:14] <redrins> dive on ahri after she misses her charm
[1:03:18] <haisho> well yeah that's what happens to dives
[1:03:18] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat you had no tankiness so diving was suicide
[1:03:19] <VritraReiRei> Wait for the CC to go out. When they are on Cooldown go in
[1:03:19] <%nmaten> one of you will die
[1:03:19] <%l3sovikk> That Morde is a coward for building defensive items
[1:03:19] <+Linearlinera> dodge charm
[1:03:19] <%secretspud> You gotta commit to fights with VI
[1:03:20] <koolaid_kevster> if you can't dive*
[1:03:20] <TBFeric> thanks!
[1:03:21] <Rhinoprotoss> EZ advice is to not build triforce when you're behind
[1:03:22] <+Linearlinera> big heart
[1:03:22] <Mister_McDerp> so don't go in first?
[1:03:25] <+chase959> you had stopwatch as well
[1:03:25] <%Vegaburd> @AngriestPat a general rule of thumb is to build tankier items when your behind and not playing a carry
[1:03:25] <%1matheuw> build tank and tenacity and pray your team follow up
[1:03:25] <dapper_wulf> Nothing wrong with how you're playing, just lack of experience for this skill tier.
[1:03:26] <jordanstayshome> moon2PH didnt honor
[1:03:26] <+Scevda> Fox slut
[1:03:30] <%freezydude> You werent that strong so you'd never kill one of them
[1:03:31] <mudai> sorry if you already talked about this, Pat, but you think LoL is more fun than Heroes of the Storm and why?
[1:03:31] <AFlyingTaco1> Dive on Ahri forever and always, pelvic thrusts first
[1:03:32] <%freezydude> but you also werent that tanky
[1:03:34] <%Ne1son> Ahri Charm plus Leona means you are going to have a bad time after you ult someone
[1:03:34] <+killfrost11> only dive on her if you see her toss her heart out
[1:03:35] <%freezydude> so you wouldnt absorm much
[1:03:38] <NotLysander> with how squishy you are, you shouldnt be instigating the dive, you counter play their move
[1:03:42] <+swaggopotamus> For starters dont ever use your Q untill you have a strong idea of what you are going into.
[1:03:43] <vingadivo> pat a lot of recomended builds are only good when you're ahead of the enemy team
[1:03:44] <+zeronic64> try a banshee veil or merci scimitar
[1:03:46] <Louie_Salmon> You can try to bait something first, then go in when they don't have that tool.
[1:03:48] <wahilliham> vi is not a particularly good character in the game atm
[1:03:50] <%freezydude> WELL YOU GOTTA LEARN PAT
[1:03:51] <%freezydude> LOL
[1:03:53] <@commanderclaw> Learn
[1:03:55] <%wujak> just skip it and move to the next thing on the list
[1:03:55] <Finchit> here come the paragraphs LUL
[1:03:55] <%nmaten> then learn dingus
[1:03:57] <+d00m0ver9000> it's just something you learn from playing
[1:03:57] <TwentyCXII> Triforce is very expensive
[1:03:57] <%Garthunox> then learn
[1:03:58] <+RenoDeGeneric> Frozen Gauntlet is a good other option
[1:03:58] <transporterthesequel> I wouldn't feel bad about that at all @AngriestPat, Jungle is legit the second hardest role in the game
[1:03:59] <%moogleboy1984> this is why relying on a third party program nerfs you hard
[1:03:59] <+Linearlinera> learning is good
[1:04:01] <%nmaten> or you will keep having games like this
[1:04:01] <+BIumen> tankier items like cleaver into steraks
[1:04:02] <%SilentEric> Right, but now you learned a thing
[1:04:02] <%truesleepking> Or get someone to teach you
[1:04:02] <tacostarvedbeast> pat still on the jangle kick?
[1:04:03] <+zeronic64> he dont need to learn nothing
[1:04:03] <%XxBTExX> Switch to recommended items if you dont know the items.
[1:04:03] <@JustinianKnight> you can set up other item builds before a game
[1:04:04] <+GrassCannon> Black Cleaver is always a solid choice for a bruiser
[1:04:04] <redrins> triforce is an item you build when you're ahead most of the time
[1:04:04] <Yubul> Learning the items is pretty important, not even just for your build.
[1:04:05] <%truesleepking> ME
[1:04:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> er Iceborne Gauntlet
[1:04:05] <+CrescentRubyRose> If you're dying, get your tankier items
[1:04:05] <%ButterMyBrisket> just know what the items do 4Head
[1:04:06] <%Albadabar> Learning takes time, but do pay attention to what each item does
[1:04:07] <simifu> PFFT
[1:04:07] <ShadeTheNovice> just search health or armour and pick something
[1:04:07] <+tuchpi> not using blitz as a guide :)
[1:04:08] <%XxBTExX> Blitz is great if you are ahead.

[1:04:34] <simulationbard> Ok contuine to suck then

[1:04:39] <Finaldragoon> okay Duncan
[1:04:40] <+Ell1ot> why don't we compromise and read it on stream?
[1:04:40] <jordanstayshome> moon2DUMB
[1:04:41] <%SilentEric> Internalize the advice but keep using ***
[1:04:41] <%wjones0415> play like a scrub
[1:04:41] <shiny_prinny> Did you send a support ticket about the text size?
[1:04:41] <%Ranryu692> if you're dying a lot, buy things that look like armor before things that look like swords
[1:04:42] <simifu> playing is the best way to learn
[1:04:45] <PhiZeroOne> our asses are dumb, this is true
[1:04:45] <NotLysander> There's like 10 items imo that are worth just learning. They are the universal offensive and defensive items
[1:04:45] <+RealThiele> i want him to load up another moba randomly and shit on LoL now
[1:04:46] <vingadivo> pat you only play tanky champions so you need to onoy learn the tank itens and there are only like 20 of them
[1:04:46] <+bananawarrior1> if it isnt the legendary pat
[1:04:46] <+d00m0ver9000> play until you have failed enough to know better
[1:04:48] <%ButterMyBrisket> never said we weren't :)
[1:04:49] <joylent_blue> reading rainbow stream
[1:04:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> i would enjoy a stream of you reading up on shit lol
[1:04:50] <Mister_McDerp> live reading on stream
[1:04:50] <%DatGuyJimbo> @AngriestPat when jungle always focus farm early and constantly check map for when people are pushing to far forward to gank
[1:04:51] <thatbandltguy> THIS IS THE PART OF THE TIME IN THE GAME WHERE YOU SEARCH UP FRAME DATA
[1:04:51] <simifu> but it would help to read LUL
[1:04:54] <+xmetalicdemonx> Do it all within a couple of hours, in front of us, so we can make fun of you
[1:04:55] <+Grayhammatter> just need to learn my dude, learn by playing
[1:04:55] <ShadeTheNovice> Just pick something that looks defensive, it doesnt matter which one its better than triforce
[1:04:56] <derekwst3> play yugioh instead
[1:04:58] <usurper_sos> LOL
[1:04:58] <tenshi_nyan> read items on stream
[1:04:58] <%Garthunox> pat I don't know how to play ryu but this guide is telling me to just do hadoukens, what am I doing wrong
[1:04:59] <BlackermanZX> yep
[1:05:00] <%SashaStarshine> YOU DONT KNOW
[1:05:00] <%nmaten> this is leagues equivalent of lab time pat
[1:05:01] <%SilentEric> Or so you think
[1:05:02] <jeosadn> reading items is for chumps
[1:05:03] <Louie_Salmon> But they could tell you an INI file to edit
[1:05:03] <HoboCabs> never know!
[1:05:04] <%1matheuw> they might
[1:05:04] <tacostarvedbeast> they might, if u UwU at them
[1:05:06] <+zeronic64> ill resub to get you play more league for giggles
[1:05:07] <Mendin> Pat maybe play with your audience that are near your general rank?
[1:05:07] <lordzarcon_> worth a shot
[1:05:08] <+D00msDayDan> or will they?
[1:05:09] <dapper_wulf> Don't worry about items, read them in game. Use search feature to find stuff that gives health and seems useful, that'll take you pretty far.
[1:05:10] <shiny_prinny> they might add an option eventually though
[1:05:11] <%Puhff> They might
[1:05:12] <itesket> maybe they will
[1:05:17] <+RealThiele> use your O R B
[1:05:18] <apolitenoob> The best option you have when you're behind is to build tanky and just be ready to eat some hits for the team
[1:05:21] <AlmondRoll> send a tweet instead
[1:05:21] <+Scevda> Play support until you decide that you have actually learned.
[1:05:22] <derekwst3> play banjo kazooie @AngriestPat
[1:05:23] <Rhinoprotoss> accessibility is really important
[1:05:25] <Brainworm205> Just read the items as you shop. Maybe don’t use Blitz and just go with recommended as needed.
[1:05:25] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov gifted a Tier 1 sub to tacostarvedbeast! They have given 171 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:05:26] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat dont worry Pat, you are only level 23, we can't expect you to memorize every item in the game and know when to build them. just focus on learning the characters and the items will come eventually
[1:05:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[1:05:29] <%NSwarmlord> They can absolutely help you in finding how to do it
[1:05:34] <+killfrost11> they will not change the rules for one mad man that wants to play on the tv
[1:05:34] <%tacostarvedbeast> @MrBorisMakarov Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:05:35] <lordzarcon_> LUL
[1:05:35] <+Glgforlifebro> trkLUL
[1:05:35] <TBFeric> do it
[1:05:36] <shiny_prinny> LUL

[1:05:37] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[1:05:37] <+Daniel_Is_I> What a coward.
[1:05:37] <%Ranryu692> you haven't already done that?

[1:05:40] <PhiZeroOne> do that instead
[1:05:41] <MassConnect> why? it's arlready there
[1:05:42] <mayorrev> !uptime
[1:05:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 5m.
[1:05:43] <%XxBTExX> Blitz is not great if you are not ahead.
[1:05:44] <%1matheuw> just do it
[1:05:44] <Quietshun13> play nuts and bolts
[1:05:46] <@ShockzNDrawe> yeah
[1:05:47] <lordzarcon_> click it
[1:05:48] <%freezydude> Thats your voice
[1:05:48] <+babrukus> uwu!!!!
[1:05:51] <%SilentEric> Try out Gragas. Look at Gragas' move set.
[1:05:52] <leinadtonu> Remember Pat, you're safe in the cube. :)
[1:05:53] <RetributionP> I mean you are THE Angrist Pat. they would do the ui for you
[1:05:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat is baby.
[1:05:54] <%1matheuw> yea
[1:05:55] <OldManDeckardCain> PAT HAS AWAKENED TO JUS- CBT
[1:05:55] <NotLysander> you did good that game imo
[1:05:57] <+plowman35> levels dont matter
[1:05:58] <haisho> NEVER play ranked
[1:05:59] <Mister_McDerp> so?
[1:06:00] <+killfrost11> yeah
[1:06:01] <+Scevda> RTFM.
[1:06:02] <%SilentEric> You'll like Gragas, he is free this week.
[1:06:03] <%nmaten> stop making excuses coward
[1:06:03] <vingadivo> pat you only play tankier champions so you only need to learn about defensive itens and there's onoy like 20 of them
[1:06:04] <%templar010> Do it better
[1:06:04] <Tressing> Pat, it takes a bit of time, don't worry about it.. and even guides are suggestions, most build depending on the match up and actual game..
[1:06:05] <+RealThiele> baby ginger field
[1:06:05] <%Binary_Fireball> @AngriestPat how are you building master yi?
[1:06:05] <%SashaStarshine> ALWAYS play ranked
[1:06:05] <+TestAnon> Hey chat did they ever get rid of runes in league?
[1:06:06] <%BeardedLuchador> the first win of the day gets you a lot of XP
[1:06:06] <+zeronic64> you all know what you signed for when you watch this stream
[1:06:07] <%tacostarvedbeast> u know peeps are just dying to give u their 10 year opinions about this game
[1:06:07] <+EdenOfLove> turn chat back on lol
[1:06:08] <OToole42> @AngriestPat someone else already said it, but if you want to learn items, make custom/practice tool games or play Co-op vs AI
[1:06:08] <lordzarcon_> its pre season anyway
[1:06:10] <haisho> Ranked is a digusting salt mine
[1:06:11] <Rhinoprotoss> level 23 is when you should know 2-3 items
[1:06:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> buy binoculars
[1:06:12] <%truesleepking> I think you still need to be lvl 30 to play ranked
[1:06:13] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> 30 used to be the max
[1:06:13] <NotLysander> for only a week+ in, that game went pretty good
[1:06:13] <Mendin> Pat I'm rank 27 and started after you and I actually learned how things worked
[1:06:14] <+killfrost11> i understand that dipshits dont in this chat
[1:06:16] <bubuche666> You just need to pay attention to you list of items recommended, just to know what you have in store, so you can decide what you need at the moment knowingly and build accordingly, that's it
[1:06:20] <joshistheman3> pat i think you should try tryndamere
[1:06:20] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat will play whatever mode is the most toxic
[1:06:24] <%WhereIsWill> don't listen to us just play we love ya regardless apatDab
[1:06:24] <derekwst3> @Quietshun13 nuts and bolts is the only one he played, so he says the series sucks
[1:06:28] <%DatGuyJimbo> you need alot of characters to play ranked
[1:06:28] <%nmaten> thats not better
[1:06:30] <joshistheman3> he's very easy champion imo
[1:06:34] <ShadeTheNovice> Chat wants to give advice, you are free to not take it for now I guess
[1:06:35] <%Sephirios> nooo, recommended stuff is even worse
[1:06:43] <VritraReiRei> @TestAnon runes are now free, merged with masteries

[1:07:17] <%templar010> This is good content
[1:07:17] <%1matheuw> OR you could go to the eye doctor

[1:07:17] <PhiZeroOne> yes you are lol
[1:07:18] <+theuselessace> Yes
[1:07:18] <NotLysander> Pat, there's only like 10-15 items you need to learn. They are the most imporant and universally used
[1:07:18] <vingadivo> YES
[1:07:18] <derekwst3> yes and read them to us
[1:07:18] <%Gogogolem> I would watc hit
[1:07:18] <+babrukus> chat asking this man to study for league like it's a test
[1:07:20] <simulationbard> Then DON'T ASK
[1:07:20] <Katalist_> chat demands it
[1:07:22] <vingadivo> DO IT
[1:07:22] <%BeardedLuchador> It's par for the course in a League stream
[1:07:23] <%Binary_Fireball> WIKI DIVE
[1:07:23] <%SlackerAlex> No. Chat is being dumb
[1:07:23] <Quietshun13> I'll watch
[1:07:23] <spaxis_> why not, people will watch it
[1:07:23] <leinadtonu> why not?
[1:07:24] <ovan20> DO IT YOU COWARD!
[1:07:25] <bear_breaker20> lol no
[1:07:25] <@JustinianKnight> you streamed Patch Notes before to be fair
[1:07:25] <Rhinoprotoss> It'd be fun
[1:07:26] <Twoiis> Yeah read patch notes instead!
[1:07:28] <+zalonar> you've streamed ff14 patch notes before
[1:07:28] <UnusualSalmon> Pat I love you and love that you're playing league
[1:07:28] <+theuselessace> DO IT
[1:07:29] <vnzuelandude> I don't understand why MOBAs are appealing. Matches are too long, too complicated, it's easy to get wrong, if the match is bad for any reason you can't leave without being penalized, and everyone is toxic.
[1:07:29] <OldManDeckardCain> YOU STREAMED YOURSELF READING FAKIN FF14 PATCHNOTES
[1:07:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't ASK questions when you know we'll say yes.
[1:07:31] <Louie_Salmon> You've streamed more boring things
[1:07:31] <+RealThiele> wikicontent
[1:07:31] <%Binary_Fireball> DO IT
[1:07:31] <+babrukus> make flash cards like it's high school
[1:07:34] <@ShockzNDrawe> HE'S SO RIGHT PAT
[1:07:34] <haisho> dude you stream FF14 patch notes
[1:07:35] <%wujak> we cant see
[1:07:36] <ItsJustShawn> if you don't know what an item does, how do you intend to capitalize on it?
[1:07:36] <%freezydude> YOU LITEERALLY READ FF14 PATCHNOTES
[1:07:37] <%SashaStarshine> LUL
[1:07:38] <UnfilteredComic> cant se
[1:07:38] <%WhereIsWill> just buy that new TV Linus was talking about Kappa
[1:07:39] <Finchit> ????
[1:07:40] <@ShockzNDrawe> NOX IS SO RIGHT
[1:07:41] <shiny_prinny> what thing we cant see
[1:07:42] <%SilentEric> Gragas is free this week. Try him out. He can go any role except Bot.

[1:07:43] <%1matheuw> yea the client is shit

[1:07:45] <%BeardedLuchador> ya the client is broke as shit
[1:07:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude Truth
[1:07:46] <leinadtonu> I'll watch. we can learn together.
[1:07:47] <VritraReiRei> What breaks?
[1:07:47] <Mister_McDerp> ff14 is more boring than reading stuff
[1:07:47] <Finchit> oh that, yeah
[1:07:49] <Rhinoprotoss> A problem entirely of your own making
[1:07:51] <BlackermanZX> Yeah happens to me too LUL
[1:07:51] <simifu> pat are you an item? Kappa
[1:07:52] <%SashaStarshine> I would simply know what the items do
[1:07:52] <+Scevda> Pat, you did FF 14 patch notes you fucking hypocrit.
[1:07:53] <PhiZeroOne> YOU ABSOLUTELY READ PATH NOTES ON STREAM LOL
[1:07:58] <%Garthunox> Pat trinity gives like 200 hp and mana and 20 in every stat, it's a good final item but not a good opener
[1:07:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> wiki dive while dead, you spent a lot of time dead last round
[1:07:59] <%Ranryu692> we don't know what "this thing" is Pat
[1:08:01] <+zeronic64> just build a bork and youll doo fine
[1:08:01] <OToole42> @SilentEric grag is played support

[1:08:08] <SheSquirreI> cause league is bad
[1:08:11] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat we were here for FF14 patch notes we can handle the wiki
[1:08:11] <%ButterMyBrisket> read a meta build for a character while you're loading? it helps to know why you build a certain way
[1:08:11] <+BIumen> its for another mode
[1:08:12] <BlackermanZX> Beacues fucking Riot
[1:08:12] <%wujak> still on big cam
[1:08:13] <Finchit> its not real
[1:08:13] <VritraReiRei> What's breaking? we can't see
[1:08:14] <+CelioHogane> SAME POTION
[1:08:14] <%tacostarvedbeast> just buy 6 hearts of gold
[1:08:15] <haisho> because game is bad at giving info
[1:08:16] <+babrukus> reading item descriptions once won't put them in his head forever you troglodytes
[1:08:17] <%1matheuw> you now we cant see it right?
[1:08:17] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Don't play jungle if you don't have good item knowhow. It's very item oriented. Top mid and adc are much simpler
[1:08:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Did he win that Vi game? I didn't catch the ending?
[1:08:19] <Jontman42> The launcher item thing is garbage and only exists to setup custom item pages
[1:08:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> Guys, you gotta understand how to give simple instructions based on descriptions of the pictures instead of their effects. doing this you can help him learn what to build and quiet the rage in your souls.
[1:08:22] <%moogleboy1984> the LoL client is sueeeeper bad
[1:08:22] <leinadtonu> Imagine you're reading patch notes.
[1:08:22] <suikudo> Perfectly calibrated LUL SeemsGood
[1:08:25] <$MachoMadnesss94> LUL
[1:08:29] <%Ranryu692> fair enough
[1:08:29] <@ShockzNDrawe> I mean thats fair
[1:08:30] <+killfrost11> new?
[1:08:32] <%freezydude> You'd learn item names
[1:08:33] <@ShockzNDrawe> it'd be entertaining tho
[1:08:39] <lordzarcon_> sounds like an excuse
[1:08:42] <+CelioHogane> Yeah id be fun!
[1:08:44] <%secretspud> One of those potions was only available to an old RNG ability that generated consumable items to you
[1:08:46] <haisho> treat it as...patching your knowledge
[1:08:48] <%freezydude> YOU DONT NEED TO LEARN THEM ALL THOUGH.
[1:08:49] <%vaporousTippler> If you had someone in the room explaining, it'd go a lot better.
[1:08:51] <Katalist_> I'm hearing lots of excuses nut no solutions
[1:08:52] <%amister3000> fuck it play another
[1:08:52] <Mister_McDerp> take a class on league
[1:08:56] <%nmaten> just play hots then
[1:08:56] <+killfrost11> best way to learn is to play honstly
[1:08:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, I definitely am the type of person who needs to USE the knowledge for it to stick with me.
[1:08:57] <+Linearlinera> i think we should learn in a nice practice match :)
[1:08:57] <%XxBTExX> Maybe print the most common items and keep them close by.
[1:08:58] <vingadivo> pat check out the new champ he is a grappler voiced by dio voice actor
[1:08:58] <+babrukus> it'd be boring, 90% of it is just +X AP
[1:08:58] <+zeronic64> its a long road folks you all sucked at the start of playing league
[1:08:58] <+Infernal_Dalek> You learned Triforce; you can learn one item per day?
[1:08:59] <%ButterMyBrisket> just read up on the specific character while you're loading that game
[1:08:59] <@ShockzNDrawe> then you'd have HotS
[1:09:00] <leinadtonu> But I love watchong you waste time!
[1:09:00] <%1matheuw> wym
[1:09:01] <OToole42> @AngriestPat Just read the items you'd be building on champs you play
[1:09:02] <+Scevda> Sounds like a you problem.
[1:09:03] <weirdmothgirl> Cmon pat, just memorize every single chat message during every single league game
[1:09:03] <Quietshun13> no
[1:09:03] <%dave323dave> what is even the point them?
[1:09:04] <Finchit> alot of those items arent in the summoner's rift mode
[1:09:04] <lordzarcon_> ill agree with you on that one.
[1:09:05] <bubuche666> Otherwise you could just read a bit of some builds, either some concerning the roles more generally or just on some champions you like. generally they explain each possibility of items briefly just to make the reader understand the different choices they have
[1:09:06] <%ThatOneGameTester> play hots 4Head
[1:09:07] <%Garthunox> top down overwatch
[1:09:08] <%galaxyswirl> why not look up relevant items for the small amount of characters you use right now and just learn those @AngriestPat
[1:09:08] <shiny_prinny> a game mode without items?
[1:09:13] <Warbot40> Kinda
[1:09:14] <Rhinoprotoss> Most guides say "build this vs this" instead of blitz gg not telling you anything
[1:09:16] <@ShockzNDrawe> IDK what tot ell you pat
[1:09:17] <Twoiis> Play Dota2. It has items and talents... and more.
[1:09:18] <+CelioHogane> It would ruin characters
[1:09:20] <@ShockzNDrawe> that's Mobas
[1:09:20] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Yeah hots did that and its dead pat.
[1:09:20] <%terribleusername> take all customization out of games
[1:09:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Traits were not confusing though?
[1:09:22] <%freezydude> DO THAT
[1:09:24] <BlackermanZX> Yeah do that
[1:09:25] <lordzarcon_> big brain
[1:09:25] <+babrukus> yeah fuck items
[1:09:26] <%freezydude> IT'D BE SO SIMPLE
[1:09:28] <Iggeh0> yes
[1:09:28] <%freezydude> JUST DO THE BRUISERS
[1:09:29] <jubejube56> what? the trait system is the only thing hots has going for it
[1:09:31] <%Typhaeon> League without items would be something like Battlerite
[1:09:32] <%dave323dave> pick a main
[1:09:33] <vingadivo> pat ffs you onoy need to learn the armor, health and damage itens ignore everything else
[1:09:34] <%SilentEric> Have you played Gragas yet?
[1:09:34] <lordzarcon_> pat...
[1:09:34] <%galaxyswirl> most of them use the same items
[1:09:35] <%freezydude> THEY ALL BUILD THE SAME SHIT BESIDES MORDE
[1:09:37] <+Linearlinera> pick a main role
[1:09:38] <%nmaten> why not just read the items they recommend on blitz
[1:09:39] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> maybe TFT is more your speed then
[1:09:39] <%tacostarvedbeast> items arent the end of the world, important but not something u gotta memorize this second
[1:09:40] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat what you are doing now is mostly fine. I would just avoid Tri-force champs as that item can really screw you sometimes
[1:09:40] <%Garthunox> PICK A TOP TIER
[1:09:44] <derekwst3> You should learn yugioh
[1:09:44] <+D00msDayDan> buy a monocular and strap it to your head
[1:09:46] <@JustinianKnight> Pat play with me in call sometime and I can help with items
[1:09:47] <+Scevda> TOP DOWN FIGHting game wooooo
[1:09:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> but you also wished sekiro had builds
[1:09:56] <@JustinianKnight> but for now just do whatever
[1:09:56] <ItsJustShawn> i think the opposite of what that guy said
[1:10:00] <%SilentEric> Learning the boots are the most important.
[1:10:01] <@ShockzNDrawe> YEAH NOX DOUBLE STREAM
[1:10:05] <NotLysander> @AngriestPat there's only about 10-15 items that you need to learn. 80% of builds use most of those items.
[1:10:06] <%bevyrage> learn the stats and keywords
[1:10:08] <%bevyrage> that's it
[1:10:09] <RetributionP> When I played I just used recommended and was like. "I'm pretty squishy ill work with defensive items
[1:10:09] <ShadeTheNovice> You only need the cost and stats of items
[1:10:09] <%SilentEric> The start with.
[1:10:10] <%ThatOneGameTester> i played too many tournaments when i was younger so i had enough RP to buy every champ and a few dozen skins after coming back to league.
[1:10:13] <Louie_Salmon> Those are the champs you're mostly playing, right?
[1:10:18] <%DatGuyJimbo> pat you wont learn them in one go only by playing a bunch
[1:10:21] <+Scevda> @justinianknight please do, he doesnt realize that with friends this all go down a lot easier.
[1:10:22] <Tressing> nah, don't worry about it.. there's two or three core items per role.. build towards those
[1:10:22] <@JustinianKnight> I don't mean on stream lol
[1:10:25] <%nmaten> most items are just stats with one or two effects
[1:10:25] <joodatious> just play for thousand hours pat its easy
[1:10:26] <+ClumnZ> its a mistake pat
[1:10:26] <@ShockzNDrawe> damnit
[1:10:27] <%1matheuw> *visible confusion
[1:10:27] <wahilliham> You only really need to learn the items you are going to be building. like you dont need to know mage items if youre learning tanks
[1:10:30] <%freezydude> SHOW US ON SCREEN
[1:10:31] <+ClumnZ> dont let it bring you down!
[1:10:32] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd say just spreadsheet a couple basic builds based on champ type and tweak as necessary when you need to
[1:10:32] <+UnderseaMagic> play ARAM
[1:10:36] <@ShockzNDrawe> y not
[1:10:37] <%GarbageNirvana> But that's me
[1:10:40] <%Garthunox> just pick a top tier
[1:10:41] <%tacostarvedbeast> just gotta play till u memorize them, it takes time
[1:10:43] <ShadeTheNovice> Cost and stats are the most important parts, everything else is minimal
[1:10:44] <+killfrost11> learning the items will come as you play dont your still learning as is get how to play the game and the charters 1st they are the bigest wall to get over right now
[1:10:45] <joylent_blue> big pat
[1:10:47] <Warbot40> just learn items for one character
[1:10:50] <haisho> that's what Paige said
[1:10:53] <+theman515> yeah
[1:10:54] <shiny_prinny> you mostly learn the final items, and just buy what builds into them mindlessly but it's still a lot
[1:10:55] <+ClumnZ> everything
[1:10:56] <vingadivo> because you dont play mages so theres no point in learning suport and ap itens
[1:10:56] <Louie_Salmon> If you're mostly playing melee AD champs, then yeah
[1:10:56] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat what are you trying to play?
[1:10:58] <usurper_sos> Even less than that
[1:10:58] <+ClumnZ> ....
[1:11:02] <+theman515> magic resist is against AP attacks
[1:11:04] <Rhinoprotoss> holy shit those items are dumb
[1:11:06] <%BeardedLuchador> Chat's wrong, just play the game
[1:11:07] <Jarvanii> since you can't read the items in-game you should make item sets to help you remember what items do in-game
[1:11:08] <Finchit> just google "league of legends items" first thing is the offical site
[1:11:08] <%bevyrage> pat click on the red crystal in Early Lane items
[1:11:09] <%freezydude> just look at Armor Magic resist and Damage.
[1:11:10] <%SilentEric> Just learn final items. Learning boots is most important
[1:11:12] <%NSwarmlord> Why are people giving such awful advice
[1:11:14] <K0TYC> there are a lot of guides telling you what to build, that was how I learned
[1:11:14] <+Scevda> Hes acting odd today isnt he?
[1:11:15] <wahilliham> We can help you make an item set and then everything youll want for X class will be right there
[1:11:15] <+theman515> Armor is against damage attacks
[1:11:17] <%Garthunox> what's your favourite role pat?
[1:11:17] <Srthunda> Chat is giving so much bad advice
[1:11:18] <%Thedoobiousone> play apelios
[1:11:18] <+ClumnZ> learn everything @AngriestPat thats the pain
[1:11:18] <%tacostarvedbeast> jungle and top right? so tanky/bruiser items?
[1:11:19] <generalve> @AngriestPat yo pat 144hz is for legit ! jsut got a new monitor
[1:11:20] <%BeardedLuchador> Just play
[1:11:20] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat what role do you like the most?
[1:11:21] <%truesleepking> Or just get someone who has been paying for a long time to explain them all
[1:11:21] <Twoiis> If anything you don't need to look to hard at the components, more the end results.
[1:11:23] <%SilentEric> Boot choice is actually match dependant.
[1:11:23] <Mister_McDerp> learning alot of characters is too much for beginners
[1:11:23] <bubuche666> Honestly i would like to help you more but i'm just so rusty, been ages since i really played LoL. the only thing is since you seem to perform better with bruisers, i would focus on top or Jungle builds. either way the set of items are generally the same for most of the roles.
[1:11:27] <+CrescentRubyRose> Pat look at the more expensive items and go down the list
[1:11:27] <+babrukus> pat ignore your chat they're brain dead LOL coomers
[1:11:27] <%truesleepking> it wouldnt take as look as you think
[1:11:28] <%SlackerAlex> Chat's wrong, just play game. Learn at your own time
[1:11:31] <+Deko_> a lot of the items are not even available in the summoners rift
[1:11:34] <%freezydude> He plays Bruisers a lot
[1:11:35] <Tressing> CLICK THE SQUARES FOR THEM TO STAY
[1:11:36] <lordzarcon_> it is.
[1:11:38] <+ChiefWilly> mid and top are popular
[1:11:38] <%BestTeaMaker> yeah
[1:11:39] <@JustinianKnight> Mid is my jam
[1:11:40] <LazyLudens> mid is the most popular

[1:11:45] <+swaggopotamus> People love mid
[1:11:45] <fragdar> @AngriestPat mid is the lane to do big damage
[1:11:45] <thatbandltguy> mids the quarterback of the team
[1:11:47] <VritraReiRei> Mid Lane has the most champions for that role
[1:11:48] <%AnIcedCoffee> Because mid is big number nukes
[1:11:48] <%ThatOneGameTester> let him play to level 100 and he will have a better idea of what he cares about
[1:11:48] <simifu> people suck each other off for mid
[1:11:48] <+ClumnZ> and junbg is the ost important this season @AngriestPat
[1:11:49] <%BeardedLuchador> People have been playing for 10 years and still don't know how to build, you'll be fine eventually
[1:11:50] <WhitePantherZ> you should pick a lane to learn then go from there
[1:11:51] <%Agami23> mids the worst.
[1:11:51] <Louie_Salmon> Mid is sort of the leader of the team
[1:11:51] <+swaggopotamus> I hate mid.
[1:11:52] <+TestAnon> mid or feed
[1:11:52] <%trunubus> that's where the try hards are at
[1:11:53] <%unfamous2423> @AngriestPat you probably get jungle or support every time
[1:11:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Just netdeck 4head
[1:11:56] <%tacostarvedbeast> pat likes to parkour
[1:11:57] <%bevyrage> pat please let me take you by the hand and give you a quick rundown on what to focus on when reading items
[1:11:58] <%Gogogolem> Talon you scum bag
[1:11:58] <%logoth_> make sure you feed your bottom
[1:11:58] <Jarvanii> mid gets farm and can gank
[1:11:58] <yourliteraldog> go bot
[1:11:58] <@ShockzNDrawe> play ashe and be a coward like me
[1:11:59] <%DatGuyJimbo> play yasuo hahaha
[1:11:59] <+Linearlinera> top is fun :)
[1:11:59] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat Mid Control the game. Mid is the the Point Guard in Basketball.
[1:12:00] <%Binary_Fireball> mid is dumb
[1:12:01] <%SilentEric> But have you played Gragas?
[1:12:01] <SweetestEggplant> honestly, the easiest way to learn this game is to just have someone sit down and answer every question that pops up as you play
[1:12:03] <%Garthunox> Pantheon mid
[1:12:03] <Jontman42> Mid is the lead singer of the band
[1:12:05] <vingadivo> pat you only need to learn the completed itens not the components
[1:12:07] <+Your_heals> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[1:12:08] <%Agami23> i play heimer mid and its scary
[1:12:11] <OToole42> @AngriestPat Mid is popular thanks to Faker, everyone wants to be him or have his kids
[1:12:12] <%Binary_Fireball> jungle is most effective
[1:12:15] <%snow_bush> Pat's good on top
[1:12:16] <%Sephirios> Blitz gg is fine for 90% of the time, its only bad in situations where you need to adapt
[1:12:16] <%nmaten> no one wanted that
[1:12:17] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat *** is serving you just fine, just avoid champs that it recommend you build Trforce for now becaue that items can cause you problems
[1:12:19] <%snow_bush> Paige says so
[1:12:23] <%1matheuw> i like pat on top
[1:12:23] <lordzarcon_> @AngriestPat we will just help you pick
[1:12:24] <%SilentEric> I disagree with that
[1:12:25] <%DatGuyJimbo> pat is totally a yasuo main
[1:12:25] <+Linearlinera> ask justinian knight how to play
[1:12:34] <WhitePantherZ> Mid and ADC(bot) are the most contested roles, top is the least contested role which is why you get it more
[1:12:34] <%SilentEric> Gragas Gragas Gragas
[1:12:34] <vingadivo> LEARN ONLY COMPLETED ITENS NOT COMPONENT ITENS
[1:12:35] <%amister3000> TOP/MID BABEEEEE
[1:12:36] <%tacostarvedbeast> u will support if u choose fill
[1:12:37] <SheSquirreI> Just use bltiz
[1:12:38] <%freezydude> Pat in that previous game you were behind, and blitz doesnt really let you adapt your build
[1:12:39] <%BeardedLuchador> fill anything is gonna get you support Kappa
[1:12:39] <%XxBTExX> When you die, see who does the most damage to you and build to counter that.
[1:12:41] <Finchit> go to league of legends site. it has the item list on their
[1:12:42] <SheSquirreI> its honestly fine
[1:12:44] <@ShockzNDrawe> nox coach pat live on stream
[1:12:47] <Warbot40> Pat, you should get a group of friends to play
[1:12:48] <%ButterMyBrisket> you need a live coach like you did for woolie in DS2
[1:12:49] <%snow_bush> Being on top makes him feel tall
[1:12:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat WTF was that forest / ragequit tweet you posted the other day? I have no idea about LOL and the guy raged for what reason?? .-.
[1:12:50] <SheSquirreI> espically for your level of play
[1:12:51] <+Scevda> truth: @vingadivo
[1:12:52] <RetributionP> do a Garen if you can. he was my main before :3
[1:12:57] <usurper_sos> Oh god
[1:12:57] <weirdmothgirl> Play support for m a x i m u m s l u d g e
[1:13:00] <Rhinoprotoss> The "I don't know what I like" into "I just want to play top" combo

[1:13:12] <%freezydude> @Rhinoprotoss Fax
[1:13:13] <%SilentEric> @AngriestPat Have you tried Gragas while he is free this week?
[1:13:16] <@JustinianKnight> I doubt he would want me to
[1:13:18] <redrins> @RetributionP garen got nerfed to shit it seems
[1:13:20] <+killfrost11> its not blizts gg dont mind stuipd fucking people in the chat
[1:13:21] <%Ne1son> Take no advice from Twitch Chat, too many people with different playstyles all yelling over eachother
[1:13:22] <generalve> @AngriestPat how much was that cube again ?
[1:13:23] <@ShockzNDrawe> guys don't @ him with dumb shit
[1:13:23] <%BeardedLuchador> Sett is a Miqo'te fuccboi
[1:13:24] <vingadivo> has pat seen Sett yet chat?
[1:13:24] <AoG_JarlRaven> @AngriestPat fuck u
[1:13:24] <+Clundy> Never thought of Pat as a top Kappa
[1:13:25] <BlackermanZX> Just use blitz and forget the item thng for now
[1:13:26] <YourPalFrost> @AngriestPat i love you thank you for streaming
[1:13:30] <+Linearlinera> i think it's because he keeps saying blitz gg as a link
[1:13:31] <%Gogogolem> Have you discovered how miserable jungle is pat?
[1:13:31] <RetributionP> omg fucking shako
[1:13:32] <@JustinianKnight> and yes don't do that
[1:13:34] <invisi_bliss> why you have to yell so much chat
[1:13:36] <+bananawarrior1> i want to rub his head
[1:13:40] <%tacostarvedbeast> u got this pat, just get in there and trial by fire it
[1:13:41] <%1matheuw> blitz gg is a crutch tho
[1:13:45] <Mendin> rub that orb
[1:13:47] <+killfrost11> use every thing to help you
[1:13:47] <vingadivo> has pat seen sett yet?
[1:13:49] <joylent_blue> "don't use @ unless it's important" <- literally the rules, chat
[1:13:50] <uhaveachoice81> So don't have a heated gamer moment if you want Pat-senpai to listen to you
[1:13:50] <bubuche666> You need to see the final objective you have in mind and then adapt in accordance. typically if you seem to be behind in terms of XP and you just can't seem to dive. try to adapt in consequences by buying more resist. the damage would not help you in any way if you're already behind
[1:13:53] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT
[1:13:56] <SheSquirreI> @AngriestPat just use blitz, its honestly fine for your level of play
[1:13:56] <tigerfang86> WHAT
[1:13:57] <yourliteraldog> wut
[1:14:00] <zupes> Half of league players advice is inaccurate and the other half only matters in top play
[1:14:00] <ovan20> WHAT?

[1:14:21] <Aluminar> hi pat
[1:14:22] <toyforus235> did you saw the new champ
[1:14:27] <%arancet> @AngriestPat quick tip for Vi, her E resets her auto attack time, so basic starter combo is to charge Q in, hit auto once, then instantly E for the third hit
[1:14:28] <+tuchpi> LMAOO
[1:14:33] <tigerfang86> that was SO BAD
[1:14:38] <pectusumbra> and back

[1:14:52] <vingadivo> Guys has pat seen Sett yet i think he'll love the new character

[1:16:37] <jordanstayshome> It used to be wores
[1:16:41] <jordanstayshome> worse
[1:16:41] <%XxBTExX> Runes dont matter much.
[1:16:44] <%Albadabar> Runes used to be worse
[1:16:44] <%1matheuw> not yet
[1:16:47] <lvl10cybermancer> Runes are a fucking terrible mechanic but at least it's not as bad as when they used to be Pay 2 Win
[1:16:48] <%tacostarvedbeast> could just say teemo is annoying

[1:16:53] <%SashaStarshine> RUNES MATTER A TON
[1:16:54] <NotLysander> yeh, runes are kinda dumb
[1:16:54] <wahilliham> runes matter a lot
[1:16:54] <%bevyrage> runes actually have a good amount of weight to them these days
[1:16:55] <Srthunda> They matter alot
[1:16:56] <shiny_prinny> that's false
[1:16:56] <%NSwarmlord> Runes do matter
[1:16:56] <@JustinianKnight> I miss old runes
[1:16:57] <+CrescentRubyRose> For a second I thought this was an Akali top game
[1:16:57] <uhaveachoice81> @scevda is that because she's going to fuck you in this game? I know nothing about LoL
[1:16:57] <stoccton> who said that
[1:16:58] <%Birdigalore> rUNES ONLY MATTER FOR EARLY GAME
[1:16:58] <Finchit> Runes are bery important.
[1:16:58] <+plowman35> minimal impact at best
[1:16:59] <%1matheuw> RUNES MATTER A LOLT
[1:16:59] <TomCrimson> Runes SUPER matter.
[1:16:59] <%SashaStarshine> THATS NOT TRUE PAT
[1:17:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> Thats super wrong
[1:17:00] <@ShockzNDrawe> so top and mid are meant to be run solo then

[1:17:02] <usurper_sos> Runes are REALLY IMPORTANT
[1:17:03] <+CelioHogane> THEY USED TO BE 10 TIMES WORSE
[1:17:03] <OToole42> What are you talking about, runes matter
[1:17:04] <%freezydude> it's just that every champion usually has one set of runes
[1:17:04] <%valkuma> Runes matter a fuck ton where they do matter dont listen to that saboteur

[1:17:08] <+NeonLight> Mainly its your keystone that matters, the rest is just additional tweaking of your style
[1:17:09] <+MrRgrs> @AngriestPat If you want to not control your items, just follow a guide off UGG or some other league site.
[1:17:09] <%TheWinged7> there used to be runes AND masteries, then they removed runes and renamed masteirs to runes
[1:17:09] <%ButterMyBrisket> jermaOneguy

[1:17:39] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat There's usually just one set of runes that are the best per character, so choosing situational runes doesnt matter much unless you're like in the TOP TOP TOP

[1:26:07] <%Big_Dream> and you willbe fine
[1:26:09] <%BeardedLuchador> Mordekaiser is the original 1v2 master
[1:26:12] <+SirNewton2> let them push the wave in your tower so you can farm safely
[1:26:16] <Rhinoprotoss> Deny your lizard brain and hold back
[1:26:17] <%TomServal> After playing Dota for so long until just last year, this game seems so baby mode. Pat can play like this and not die?

[1:26:30] <+Scevda> @rhinoprotoss truth
[1:26:37] <Buzzard42> ????
[1:26:40] <+lupinelass120> for casters, you can do Hit->Tower Shot -> Hit to guarantee a kill
[1:26:41] <redrins> man that garen is an idiot
[1:26:42] <pectusumbra> good trade!
[1:26:42] <tigerfang86> DEATH ZONE STUFF
[1:26:43] <%1matheuw> almost killed
[1:26:44] <%SashaStarshine> @CommanderSqueaks There's a secondary path from the jungle/river to the lanes that is mirrored. It's closer to redside's toplane turret and closer to blueside's botlane turret. Which means redside top is more dangerous and blueside bot is more dangerous
[1:26:45] <an0n00dl3> pat
[1:26:46] <BlackermanZX> Damn good trade
[1:26:50] <vingadivo> garen is an idito
[1:26:50] <%Agami23> pat, shoulden't you save ult for when they are low so you can kill??
[1:26:51] <+RealThiele> he did a good
[1:26:51] <%tacostarvedbeast> shadow realm
[1:26:52] <CrimsonFox777> What's up with this champion? Constant mana drain but gain mana on hits?
[1:26:53] <an0n00dl3> why dont you auto attack before the turrent shoots
[1:26:55] <Buzzard42> actually that was a great trae
[1:27:00] <illusion_of_skill> Relax you're doing fine VoHiYo
[1:27:02] <an0n00dl3> and then auto adfter it shoots
[1:27:02] <Rhinoprotoss> Bad trade
[1:27:03] <NotLysander> the usual pattern for clearing caster minions under tower is hit the minion let tower shoot minion and hit minon
[1:27:04] <%bevyrage> pat you gotta ward your river
[1:27:06] <WhitePantherZ> you should go the blue staff with the diamond tip first item
[1:27:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is much better than last game.
[1:27:15] <vingadivo> hes csing way better than last week
[1:27:16] <TioXyco> the jank
[1:27:20] <%bananawarrior1> pat needs over a 100 games to start learning guys calm down
[1:27:23] <+Venaire> He should build 6x RoA and full meme it
[1:27:29] <jimmypurple> When he ults, can allies enter the circle?
[1:27:36] <%wizardsloth1> wizardsloth1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:27:36] <%DatGuyJimbo> its because mord is a cheap champ

[1:28:26] <iwa5h4ck3d> right now
[1:28:27] <+CelioHogane> When he leaves
[1:28:27] <Mister_McDerp> now?
[1:28:29] <usurper_sos> now
[1:28:30] <BlackermanZX> When he leaves
[1:28:30] <VritraReiRei> Push to tower then back @AngriestPat
[1:28:31] <redrins> now
[1:28:32] <%SashaStarshine> After you push in a wave
[1:28:32] <+ShovelFace117> When he's missing
[1:28:32] <%wujak> when you have enough money for the next thing you want to buy
[1:28:32] <Elsewize> When you have enough money.
[1:28:33] <pectusumbra> when you have the money for what you want
[1:28:33] <%secretspud> Once you can afford something
[1:28:34] <%Albadabar> Like push the lane out then go back
[1:28:34] <lvl10cybermancer> When the enemy laner is gone and lane is pushed usually
[1:28:35] <%NSwarmlord> after clearing the wave
[1:28:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> After you make the enemy run away to heal.
[1:28:35] <OToole42> @AngriestPat when you push the wave into tower
[1:28:35] <%SlackerAlex> When he leaves
[1:28:35] <+RealThiele> hes back tho
[1:28:36] <%DatGuyJimbo> when you can complete one probs
[1:28:36] <simulationbard> Push lane in and back
[1:28:36] <$Jmann1892> Shove the lane in and get items
[1:28:36] <ShadeTheNovice> When you push minions to tower
[1:28:37] <simifu> wave pushed
[1:28:37] <wahilliham> after the cannon wave is best time
[1:28:37] <NotLysander> During a wave clear. its with the flow of the minion waves
[1:28:37] <+MrRgrs> low level: after you push the wave
[1:28:37] <%killfrost11> now
[1:28:38] <redrins> well not anymore
[1:28:38] <%1matheuw> after psuhing your minions to his tower
[1:28:38] <+SirNewton2> push the wave under the tower first then back
[1:28:39] <BlackermanZX> Push the wae firat
[1:28:40] <Srthunda> try not doing so at all just to flex on the enemy
[1:28:40] <bubuche666> When your opponnent in lane has backed would be nice
[1:28:40] <%Vegaburd> after you push the wave into his turret
[1:28:40] <+ShovelFace117> Use the pressure so it isnt wasted
[1:28:40] <ALazo> now
[1:28:41] <illusion_of_skill> When you push the minion wave into the turret
[1:28:41] <+DangerSmoog> after you push in wave to his turret OR get it frozen near your turret
[1:28:42] <koolaid_kevster> you can out sustain his damage with conqueror next time he tries to fight you hit him back @angriestpat
[1:28:42] <Mister_McDerp> welp
[1:28:42] <+Elky3> when you have enough to buy a full item @AngriestPat
[1:28:43] <Rhinoprotoss> after pushing tower or you're low
[1:28:43] <RetributionP> yea let mins get to tower
[1:28:43] <%Agami23> its abit odd with heroes who dont have mana.
[1:28:43] <+seaearthandsky> OOF
[1:28:44] <WhitePantherZ> @AngriestPat shove your minions to their tower then go back
[1:28:45] <zayasu> you're getting camped :(
[1:28:45] <usurper_sos> F
[1:28:45] <Elsewize> Yeah, right about then. xD
[1:28:45] <jubejube56> excellent time
[1:28:45] <+OneGorillionDollars> When you want to get items Push the lane as hard as you can to tower
[1:28:45] <%ButterMyBrisket> about 20 seconds ago LUL
[1:28:45] <shiny_prinny> when you have enough for something and he leaves
[1:28:46] <%Big_Dream> the fast way back
[1:28:46] <Wakerpl> LUL
[1:28:46] <tylerpyre> When you shove the minion wave under Garen's turret.
[1:28:47] <$Dakuu75> right around 1,300-1,500 gold. you get the item, get a power spike from fresh items
[1:28:47] <Nanomachiner> Whenever the hell you want as long as you're sure you won't get fucked like you just did @AngriestPat
[1:28:47] <+Scevda> After clearing
[1:28:48] <+thecho1> push the wave then get back
[1:28:48] <%terribleusername> at least now he can get items
[1:28:48] <%BeardedLuchador> free back!!! \o/
[1:28:48] <breguenait> push the lane so he loses minions to tower and go back
[1:28:49] <%TheWinged7> perfect
[1:28:49] <pectusumbra> you push then you back
[1:28:50] <tigerfang86> great job
[1:28:50] <%killfrost11> well push up the wave as much as you can then go back really
[1:28:50] <studleydoorite> neverrr jermaOneguy
[1:28:50] <+xddddsorandom> it's ok Patrick
[1:28:50] <%1matheuw> welp now you can buy itens
[1:28:51] <redrins> remember to signal missing
[1:28:51] <ShadeTheNovice> Push minions to tower then go back
[1:28:52] <+plowman35> if you know they are back at base its same
[1:28:52] <an0n00dl3> Push and go back
[1:28:53] <+Venaire> @AngriestPat You want to spam to push in lane generally, and then the minions are at his tower. Go buy
[1:28:53] <vingadivo> you want to push your minions into the enemy tower to negate cs to the enemy and then go base
[1:28:54] <+plowman35> safe
[1:28:55] <+TissueBoxDan> it depends but usually when u push the wave to the tower
[1:28:56] <%GarbageNirvana> When I played I usually went back any time my gold hit quad digits
[1:28:58] <%NSwarmlord> Shove the wave
[1:28:59] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:28:59] <%Albadabar> Push the lane out a bit, go back
[1:29:00] <+SirNewton2> push the wave under the tower first then back.
[1:29:01] <Tressing> when the minions are pushing you have time to go base and return
[1:29:02] <wahilliham> if you have your teleport you can do it at any time, but after a cannon wave is a safe bet usually
[1:29:03] <%tacostarvedbeast> usually should time back against there back, so u stay on same strength level as them, or when uve shoved lane hard and have items to buy
[1:29:03] <%VantomPayne> generally when you had a lane advantage/is unsafe to push any further, also good when you have enough money for your first core item
[1:29:04] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Never
[1:29:04] <BlackermanZX> yes
[1:29:05] <depressedpepega> free tp to base PogChamp
[1:29:06] <%DatGuyJimbo> not magic resist boots
[1:29:07] <an0n00dl3> try not to do it on waves where the cannon is there
[1:29:08] <haisho> if wave pushes to tower then yeah
[1:29:08] <lvl10cybermancer> It's okay, learning when you can be greedy and when you can't just comes with time
[1:29:11] <NotLysander> yes wave timing is when you decide when to leave
[1:29:12] <+Scevda> Right now? *wait 5 seconds*
[1:29:14] <koolaid_kevster> after you push the lane to the tower @angriestpat
[1:29:14] <+ShovelFace117> The tower makes him miss minions
[1:29:18] <%nmaten> the goal when you back is to miss as little cs as possible
[1:29:20] <%Thedoobiousone> if you can get your minions pushing into his turret is the best time to back so that you dont miss out on minions and gold
[1:29:20] <+RealThiele> careful
[1:29:21] <%killfrost11> you want to make sure he doesnt get to farm mions
[1:29:21] <an0n00dl3> Pat, push before backing
[1:29:23] <BlackermanZX> That garen is shitting his pants
[1:29:23] <+CelioHogane> @AngriestPat basically in that situation you just push the minions to the enemy side and then go back, so you don't leave the enemy alone in top too much
[1:29:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> !uptime
[1:29:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 29m.
[1:29:25] <%BeardedLuchador> Noc is probably Bff's with Garen IRL
[1:29:26] <+RealThiele> dont fall for the 2v1
[1:29:26] <%Sephirios> usualy when you can afford an item. then you push out the wave to the tower and go back and shop
[1:29:30] <an0n00dl3> and try not to back when there's a cannon
[1:29:32] <NotLysander> It's most dangerous when you are out past the half way point,. so sometimes it's just best to go back and let the minons die on the tower
[1:29:34] <an0n00dl3> a cannon minion
[1:29:36] <WhitePantherZ> why the mr item?
[1:29:38] <zenith0111> LOL STREAMER NOW PAT

[1:30:42] <%BeardedLuchador> You can also take some plates too
[1:30:42] <Tressing> yep
[1:30:43] <toyforus235> bait
[1:30:44] <%RayDaug> Typing is the worst thing you can do in this game. Don't ever do it.
[1:30:44] <Mister_McDerp> not yet
[1:30:44] <BlackermanZX> Get the Tower Platings if you can
[1:30:46] <Rhinoprotoss> Ye
[1:30:46] <%killfrost11> now back
[1:30:46] <lvl10cybermancer> Yeah, now he misses creeps
[1:30:47] <+MrRgrs> you'll get them later
[1:30:48] <vingadivo> HES LEARNING YEEE
[1:30:49] <+thecho1> it will come to you
[1:30:50] <+Scevda> I cant believe he has not run into a garen that emote spams.
[1:30:50] <pectusumbra> sitting under the tower just makes you vulnerable
[1:30:51] <%nmaten> youll be back in lane in time
[1:30:51] <%tacostarvedbeast> cant get em all pat, items important
[1:30:51] <+kingofcinders> The wave will reset in the middle now
[1:30:52] <%secretspud> You'll get back to lane to get them in time
[1:30:52] <+RealThiele> your creep dying to creep aint a big deal
[1:30:53] <+CelioHogane> That's fine
[1:30:53] <Ire_C_Vangal> get ninja tabi
[1:30:54] <VritraReiRei> you could have gotten a Plate before backing
[1:30:54] <iwa5h4ck3d> wait for 850
[1:30:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat Infinite Greed Works.
[1:30:56] <usurper_sos> Good advice, bad chat Kappa
[1:30:56] <NotLysander> no, let them build up momentum and push back to your tower, where you are safer
[1:30:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> spend your gold
[1:30:56] <toyforus235> recall
[1:31:00] <Rhinoprotoss> they'll be there when you talk back
[1:31:01] <ShadeTheNovice> By the time you get back you can get them
[1:31:02] <vingadivo> they'll mostly sitll be alive on you way back
[1:31:05] <+Kingtut9009> @AngriestPat It's a canon wave and it was pushed to his tower, will slow push back, wave managment is a big part of abusing top lane
[1:31:05] <+SirNewton2> by the time you get back to lane you meet them into you tower
[1:31:05] <%NSwarmlord> They'll be in a good spot when you get back so it's fine
[1:31:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> how do you go back to lane with 800 gold jesus
[1:31:09] <+RenoDeGeneric> Try not to leave on a cart wave, but yeah generally you can leave after you kill them
[1:31:10] <%Vegaburd> nah, if you stay at his tower too long its an open invite for a gank
[1:31:11] <+kingofcinders> Garen will have lost a couple of minions worth of gold and xp because of that
[1:31:13] <%killfrost11> by the time you get back up thier you meet them at your side
[1:31:13] <Elsewize> Waiting 20-30 gold is ok
[1:31:15] <an0n00dl3> Also, try to back when you have the money for the itms you want/need
[1:31:18] <an0n00dl3> ALSO
[1:31:20] <%Albadabar> It's fine, you're learning
[1:31:23] <vingadivo> you always want to be back to lane just before the minions hit you tower
[1:31:24] <an0n00dl3> BUY LIANDRY BEFORE RILAIS
[1:31:25] <BlackermanZX> Its fine
[1:31:25] <lvl10cybermancer> Yeah give him a break
[1:31:26] <Ledsagar> chat why y'all keep calling them creeps??
[1:31:26] <an0n00dl3> NO
[1:31:28] <an0n00dl3> NO PAT

[1:31:44] <+Grayhammatter> for sure, but why though?
[1:31:45] <%Vegaburd> IM TRYING TO HELP{
[1:31:46] <Rhinoprotoss> Morde has 3 items and you haven't learnt them?
[1:31:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Not me! I have NO IDEA what happuning! :D

[1:31:49] <%Vegaburd> NO GOD JESUS
[1:31:50] <%killfrost11> you keep asking questions
[1:31:50] <%Faustgesicht> Star Trek is neat
[1:31:51] <Beheziel> yeyeyyr DO I5
[1:31:53] <+D00msDayDan> if you think this is backseating you should watch woolie's death stranding streams
[1:31:53] <%WhereIsWill> just a damn ghost town LUL
[1:31:55] <spinbel> I thought you wanted back seaters
[1:31:57] <+MrRgrs> *Asks questions to chat* "GODDAM BACKSEATERS"
[1:31:57] <stoccton> simifu a lot of people won't ever stop let's be real LUL
[1:31:58] <WhitePantherZ> does he actually not want advice? like is backseating bad here?
[1:31:59] <+Scevda> Says the drop your shield fairy.
[1:31:59] <xstormyone> IRON 4 BACKSEATING CANNOT BE STOPPED
[1:31:59] <VritraReiRei> Emote only Mode! GivePLZ
[1:32:00] <+Linearlinera> sorry man
[1:32:01] <bleugh> nyannDab
[1:32:01] <Jontman42> There's a fine line between giving advice and backseating
[1:32:04] <ShichiNoBushi> I'd still be here, because I have no idea how to play either.
[1:32:05] <koolaid_kevster> after a kill push the wave to the tower and recall if your half hp or under
[1:32:06] <@ShockzNDrawe> so it's stream tax then?
[1:32:06] <%Vegaburd> ult
[1:32:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrRgrs Truth
[1:32:07] <Louie_Salmon> I legitimately don't understand what you want us to do other than backseat
[1:32:08] <usurper_sos> You literally ask us for help
[1:32:08] <Mister_McDerp> because we ruin the learning
[1:32:08] <%ryome> Backseat HARDER
[1:32:15] <koolaid_kevster> *advice
[1:32:15] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> You're asking us to backseat you cwoard
[1:32:16] <+guitarburst05> I quit playing this game a good 5 years ago and just tried it again, it feels fucking FOREIGN now
[1:32:18] <simifu> think you got this
[1:32:19] <stoccton> shadow realm yeye
[1:32:19] <%SashaStarshine> DAMN RIGHT PAT FUCK THIS CHAT!
[1:32:21] <+guitarburst05> learning curve is STEEP
[1:32:21] <Rhinoprotoss> YES
[1:32:22] <tigerfang86> IN THE ZONE
[1:32:23] <%VantomPayne> thats another way of saying you dont learn unless you are being shouted at apatDab
[1:32:24] <BlackermanZX> Dang
[1:32:24] <stoccton> OH SHIT
[1:32:25] <NotLysander> that was a good juke
[1:32:25] <simifu> almost
[1:32:26] <$FrogROOT> FeelsBadMan
[1:32:26] <%tacostarvedbeast> shove hard
[1:32:26] <pectusumbra> that's okay
[1:32:26] <ALazo> sneaky garen
[1:32:28] <%Vegaburd> got his flash
[1:32:28] <+seaearthandsky> almost
[1:32:31] <%okatokat_live> okatokat_live subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat what got you started on league? It's a great game and all but as someone who wants to get way better at it I feel like it wears down on my mental. Do you know if you'll start getting addicted and fall for the loot box openings again?
[1:32:31] <%Vegaburd> thats a win
[1:32:31] <bubuche666> Just so you know don't forget that if you're at an advantage compared to you top opponnent you could try to gank bot lane with you Teleport
[1:32:31] <Srthunda> I love how chat is trying to treat you like a pet that keeps trying to eat something they shouldn't
[1:32:32] <Tressing> Bot matches are good for learning item builds
[1:32:32] <VritraReiRei> You got Flash, that's still good!
[1:32:33] <+TissueBoxDan> league is a hard game man. u are doin good
[1:32:34] <%nmaten> thats good he burned f and you can deny cs
[1:32:37] <vingadivo> he flashed thats worth pat
[1:32:37] <+Grayhammatter> got his flash though?
[1:32:37] <RetributionP> Garen is fast boi
[1:32:38] <pectusumbra> now he has to run away and you get dat cheddar
[1:32:38] <ShadeTheNovice> you got a flash, thats good
[1:32:39] <+SirNewton2> CHALLENGER 2020
[1:32:39] <%killfrost11> sooo close
[1:32:40] <BlackermanZX> He flashed so all good
[1:32:40] <+exia2007> u asserted dominance so its a win
[1:32:42] <Oxybe> Backseat 2: backseat harder, with a vengeance
[1:32:51] <VritraReiRei> You can get two Plates
[1:32:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Forcing enemy to retreat is still a W.
[1:32:53] <Louie_Salmon> @srthunda That is an extremely good analogy
[1:32:55] <+mgskomododragon> the important question is... you having fuuuun?
[1:32:58] <$FrogROOT> this game looks hard as fuck to learn
[1:33:03] <Slim_Lipid> BOT IS FED
[1:33:07] <Jarvanii> morde's ult applies fear to garen irl
[1:33:08] <%tacostarvedbeast> two plates, def worth
[1:33:08] <%secretspud> This game IS hard as fuck to learn
[1:33:09] <usurper_sos> can he knock tower?
[1:33:10] <%Partialrecall2> jungles in mid push tower
[1:33:14] <Rhinoprotoss> Now we back
[1:33:15] <+MrRgrs> LOOK UP A A GUIDE
[1:33:17] <Mister_McDerp> items are hard
[1:33:17] <+MrRgrs> UGG
[1:33:20] <%Vegaburd> just spend some time off stream
[1:33:21] <illusion_of_skill> Use a guide
[1:33:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @FrogROOT It is and it isn't, it really depends on how easily you can remember stuff.
[1:33:24] <%DatGuyJimbo> You will learn it from playing
[1:33:24] <%nmaten> its something that youll learn in time
[1:33:24] <+RealThiele> it reminds me of menuing in a speedrun
[1:33:26] <lvl10cybermancer> Items kind of suck in League because they're so one-dimensional so you can't even be creative with them
[1:33:26] <%amister3000> that comes with time
[1:33:26] <%1matheuw> its just because you cant read
[1:33:29] <Rhinoprotoss> Morde has 3 items and you can't learn them?
[1:33:32] <%secretspud> Looking up a guide doesn't help if he has no context
[1:33:33] <stoccton> LUL
[1:33:33] <redrins> I cant believe that E hit with the tip
[1:33:34] <lvl10cybermancer> But you still have to spend so long learning htem
[1:33:35] <illusion_of_skill> Alcove plays PogChamp
[1:33:35] <lordzarcon_> a big part of that is because you cant read them.
[1:33:37] <%killfrost11> the item stuff is a big hill to get over in this game
[1:33:37] <%SilentEric> That is what *** was you goofs
[1:33:38] <Louie_Salmon> The items are a whole thing, it takes a bit
[1:33:38] <OldManDeckardCain> JUST READ THE ITEMS WHEN YOU GET A SHIET ATTACK AGAIN
[1:33:42] <stoccton> hide and seek with garen
[1:33:43] <TwentyCXII> If you played off-stream in front of a monitor you'd pick up the items pretty quick
[1:33:43] <+Scevda> Lol
[1:33:45] <%NSwarmlord> Is it frustrating because of the text size issue or in general?
[1:33:46] <+kingofcinders> @AngriestPat Cannon minions are worth a lot more Pat, use an ability to secure them if you have to until cs'ing becomes easier. Mordekaiser has no mana anyway.
[1:33:47] <NotLysander> Garren's ult
[1:33:47] <%DatGuyJimbo> his ult
[1:33:48] <%Reaviar> silenced

[1:33:56] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat Garen's ult does more dmg the lower your health
[1:33:57] <%tacostarvedbeast> garen ult is an execute, lower health means more damage
[1:33:57] <@ShockzNDrawe> his minions were shipping at your health
[1:33:58] <%Agami23> do you know garens ult?

[1:34:01] <an0n00dl3> rip
[1:34:01] <%BeardedLuchador> garen will ALWAYS try to get you to about 30-40% hp
[1:34:01] <shiny_prinny> his Q silenced you, then he ulted you
[1:34:03] <weirdmothgirl> His ult does more damage the lower your health is
[1:34:03] <%1matheuw> his ult is a execute

[1:35:53] <lordzarcon_> flash
[1:35:55] <+atwitchical> Pat, this is the only advice I'll give. You should have ulted Sona.
[1:35:55] <+Kingtut9009> Bot is top because bot tower is gone, they're rotating to take your tower Pat
[1:35:55] <+Scevda> Lol
[1:35:57] <%1matheuw> your bot sucks
[1:35:59] <%killfrost11> hes not even 30
[1:36:00] <$Jmann1892> Hate saying but that's Top Lane
[1:36:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> If someone tries to team up on you like that, you can just ult one of them.
[1:36:00] <%BeardedLuchador> this is quite a game Keepo
[1:36:04] <lvl10cybermancer> Yeah people are rotating now
[1:36:04] <ShadeTheNovice> They have transitioned into midgame
[1:36:04] <LiteralFraud> Hey pat, how you likin league so far?
[1:36:05] <yellowpandamilo> just joined to see pat dead as shit
[1:36:07] <%BeardedLuchador> in terms of the rotatoes

[1:36:08] <%Fenrirlives> submit to Sona!
[1:36:09] <+tuchpi> BOT IS FED
[1:36:10] <vingadivo> pat check out sett hes a grappler and voiced by dio V.O

[1:36:25] <simifu> welcome to this game LUL
[1:36:28] <+doe3879> You should play JUNGLE and get yelled at some more
[1:36:29] <joylent_blue> big fustating
[1:36:31] <+kingofcinders> Pat, are there any champions you've seen but not played yet that look interesting to you?
[1:36:32] <lvl10cybermancer> Very interdasting
[1:36:36] <OToole42> @AngriestPat laning phase ends when the first tower falls, so since bot lane lost its turret, they rotate lanes to take out your tower for the free gold
[1:36:38] <yourliteraldog> My friend from college who played league told me that one of his old high-school, once did heroin while playing league with him . It went as well as you expect it would.
[1:36:38] <LiteralFraud> That's pretty much how I feel about it lol. Lots of good parts, but almost just as much bad parts
[1:36:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> it's FUSTRATING
[1:36:40] <Lithdoran> The only playable ADCs, at least in higher MMR, are Xayah and Kai;sa
[1:36:43] <%mield916> wait, you can teleport?
[1:36:43] <Rhinoprotoss> Ward
[1:36:43] <%tacostarvedbeast> @doe3879 jungle difference

[1:38:24] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat when you play while not streaming, do you use the second monitor as your game screen so you can actually read stuff?
[1:38:24] <%Gogogolem> Illaoi is super hard to play properly

[1:39:15] <+Scevda> And you rather sit there and whine about it than change.
[1:39:16] <+kingofcinders> Illaoi is a HUGE lane bully, a lot of junglers are scared to go near toplane if she's there because she can very easily turn a 2v1 around.
[1:39:16] <+guitarburst05> having just come back... new yorick and old yorick are really different; i really preferred old yorick
[1:39:17] <OToole42> yorick has a cool guns and roses skin

[1:47:02] <lvl10cybermancer> GUYS STOP BACKSEATING HOLY SHIT
[1:47:05] <+xddddsorandom> AngriestPat The toxicity of League is not really that people are mean it's that people want to micromanage you, in game and out. "Why did you miss that, buy that, do this"
[1:47:05] <simulationbard> @1matheuw No
[1:47:07] <%Teintstein> why is chat crawling up pat's ass about this

[1:47:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Mrbaconator Truth.
[1:47:14] <jeosadn> @AngriestPat Why not run the game fullscreen at 1080p? That ought to make the text larger

[1:47:18] <%TheWinged7> get anything that builds out od the blue chainmail
[1:47:24] <BlackermanZX> NO problem
[1:47:24] <ShadeTheNovice> Read the situation better pat, this game is about ebbs and flows abck and forth. When you do something good, retreat, when you have retreated and formed up again, go it
[1:47:24] <%1matheuw> because this game is cursed
[1:47:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> You need a separate setup for every single game, your home should be like an arcade
[1:47:26] <+Grayhammatter> you're doing fine pat
[1:47:27] <bubuche666> It's magic resist, not armor
[1:47:28] <pectusumbra> it's FINE
[1:47:30] <+Linearlinera> its ok!
[1:47:30] <lvl10cybermancer> It's not technically optimal but it's fine
[1:47:30] <%killfrost11> please turn blitz gg back on it will help you more than hurt dont worry about assholes
[1:47:31] <macathelo> becaquse u need armor
[1:47:31] <Jontman42> "You need armor" isn't helpful when he doesn't know what the armor items are
[1:47:32] <%SilentEric> That is fine
[1:47:32] <%InugamiTheHound> because evveryone in chat is a LOL pro
[1:47:34] <theobble> back pat
[1:47:34] <vingadivo> it ok
[1:47:35] <%BeardedLuchador> the akali is really theo nly magic, but it's fine
[1:47:36] <+burningchariot> that gives magic resist
[1:47:36] <%SilentEric> It's not a problem
[1:47:37] <%TheWinged7> @AngriestPat its the wrong defense stat
[1:47:37] <%Vegaburd> you need armor not magic resist
[1:47:37] <macathelo> not magic armor
[1:47:37] <%freezydude> you know what, your fine.
[1:47:37] <simulationbard> Armor would be better that's magic resist
[1:47:37] <shiny_prinny> it has magic resist, but that doesn't help against jhin
[1:47:38] <%SashaStarshine> It's fine but not optimal
[1:47:38] <Claxter_> don't cater to the moba audience, they'll only hurt you
[1:47:40] <Lithdoran> Nothing, people are dumb.
[1:47:40] <Katmon27> LUL
[1:47:43] <%KevinsLunchbox> LMAO
[1:47:45] <NotLysander> @AngriestPat the people who are doing the damage on the other team to you are AD. you should be buying armor, not magic resist
[1:47:45] <theobble> good
[1:47:48] <%DatGuyJimbo> that was the right person to ult Good Job
[1:47:48] <Oxybe> Get a desk for Elmo. make him wear a tiny tie and do work.
[1:47:49] <haisho> okay that was pretty good
[1:47:50] <theKingRamses> it's magic armor and they're mostly physical
[1:47:52] <lordzarcon_> most of their team is ad dmg, and your are buying magic resist
[1:47:52] <+seaearthandsky> corned herself limesLUL
[1:47:53] <redrins> you are getting chunked from physical damage, not magic damage
[1:47:53] <%galaxyswirl> its magic risist, and the enemy team is attack damage based
[1:47:54] <+Linearlinera> nice work pat!
[1:47:54] <%SilentEric> Good job Pat, keep killing that Sona
[1:47:54] <+burningchariot> nice flash
[1:47:54] <+UnderseaMagic> not bad
[1:47:57] <+Elky3> you bought Magic resist when there team is mostly non magic DMG @AngriestPat
[1:48:00] <%SilentEric> Allied plant lady
[1:48:03] <+tuchpi> good sona kill :)
[1:48:04] <vingadivo> good uot pat
[1:48:04] <%1matheuw> jhin's fourth shot is an execute
[1:48:05] <LiteralFraud> It's not as good as any armor you could've bought, but it's still useful
[1:48:05] <%Sephirios> its magic resist and the enemy team is mostly physical dmg
[1:48:05] <Lithdoran> Spectre's Cowl is fine, like, it builds into something that boosts your built-in sustain.
[1:48:05] <$FrogROOT> OMEGALUL
[1:48:06] <lvl10cybermancer> Like god damn people jumping down his throat when he's not playing this game he just started playing perfectly
[1:48:06] <+Scevda> Yep only one type of defense in this game. Nothing like a second one
[1:48:07] <%ledgefiendd> wrong type of defense thing is why
[1:48:08] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:48:10] <@ShockzNDrawe> This is like IRL Disco Elysium and chat are all the voices screaming at him to do different shit
[1:48:10] <+kingofcinders> The biggest damage threats on the enemy team are physical damage dealers, their damage is reduced by Armor, not so much by Magic Resist.
[1:48:12] <+Baekon01> he doesnt know tho
[1:48:15] <toyforus235> that baiting
[1:48:16] <TofuNyan> Spirit visage helps when he heals from his shield, it direclty counters the -% Heal that he has on his shield and gives him full heal lol
[1:48:17] <ShadeTheNovice> no they dont LUL
[1:48:18] <+D00msDayDan> @NotLysander except he can't tell which is armor or magic because he can't read
[1:48:19] <projectcapsule> most of their dmg is physical pat so stack some armour

[1:50:46] <NotLysander> @AngriestPat the other team is mostly doing AD damage vs you, not AP. That item gives you magic resistance
[1:50:46] <pectusumbra> damn it team
[1:50:46] <RantingRavager> "WHERE WAS MY TEAM"
[1:50:47] <lordzarcon_> you lost the teram fight so no
[1:50:48] <+Linearlinera> it was ok depending on the teamfight
[1:50:49] <ape_hawk> maybe
[1:50:49] <%killfrost11> that works too
[1:50:50] <%Vegaburd> yes
[1:50:50] <lvl10cybermancer> IT would have been if not for your team doing a bad
[1:50:50] <%DatGuyJimbo> if you won the team fight after sure
[1:50:50] <xeros720> rip
[1:50:50] <%galaxyswirl> IT WAS

[1:50:52] <BlackermanZX> it works
[1:50:53] <vingadivo> NO but nice try
[1:50:53] <%1matheuw> i mean if your team wasnt dumb it woud be
[1:50:53] <ShadeTheNovice> if you say its worth then it is
[1:50:54] <%TheWinged7> and you lost the baron buff
[1:50:54] <+kingofcinders> You should get Jhin out of the fight, he's the biggest threat on their team.
[1:50:54] <Jarvanii> no since you lost baron buff
[1:50:55] <+SirNewton2> you gave a shut down and lost barron
[1:50:55] <ape_hawk> yes
[1:50:55] <+Linearlinera> yes it was super worth it
[1:50:55] <LiteralFraud> Jhin or Akali would've been a better pick, Pat
[1:50:56] <+ShovelFace117> more of them are dead
[1:50:56] <%killfrost11> you still get stats from him
[1:50:56] <theKingRamses> ok maybe

[1:50:58] <toyforus235> you got the assassin

[2:06:09] <%Ranryu692> if your q hits a champion, you will heal a bit
[2:06:10] <%DatGuyJimbo> Q empowers heal
[2:06:10] <+kingofcinders> Hit Q skillshot, get a heal on yourself.

[2:06:24] <%Vegaburd> E is silence
[2:06:25] <icosahedralAPOI> just throw bananas
[2:06:31] <trombonechemist8> Q does damage and puts a heal over time on you
[2:06:32] <lvl10cybermancer> Leashing probably
[2:06:33] <%Vegaburd> and it binds if they stay in for too long
[2:06:33] <%NSwarmlord> STINKRAT
[2:06:37] <$Instagig> There's a delay to it
[2:06:38] <%freezydude> By aiming, Pat.

[2:06:46] <lvl10cybermancer> Gotta lead the target
[2:06:47] <SpookySpaghooti> Big brain Aphelios
[2:06:48] <%moogleboy1984> From out of the sewers comes DOOOOOOM
[2:06:49] <theobble> you lead with it
[2:06:50] <mackonslaught> At last Thresh and Twitch are somewhat immobile
[2:06:51] <%freezydude> You didnt aim good enough then.
[2:06:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> You might wanna look up a guide for her later if you wanna play her more
[2:06:51] <haisho> Just play perfectly Pat
[2:06:52] <%killfrost11> lead your shots
[2:06:53] <%ledgefiendd> yeah you have to lead it hard
[2:06:53] <Finaldragoon> aim better
[2:06:53] <tegas_> She's not really an aggro champ you can play it safe.
[2:06:53] <@commanderclaw> Is this the goat girl? Someone call Plague
[2:06:56] <tigerfang86> LMAO
[2:06:57] <%enickma11> Just gotta put it where they have to be
[2:06:57] <%arsonistdaria> Remember when Pat was telling Woolie how much he learned
[2:07:02] <dragonslayingronin> position it so they have to move towards you to avoid it and then auto attack them
[2:07:05] <%killfrost11> shoot where they are going
[2:07:05] <usurper_sos> nice
[2:07:06] <BlackermanZX> W is a heal
[2:07:06] <%SilentEric> Your Q is slower the farther you shoot it. Think of it as having travel time. @AngriestPat
[2:07:06] <alwayspronking> Clap
[2:07:09] <trombonechemist8> Watch their support, he can grab ya
[2:07:10] <%killfrost11> not where they are
[2:07:10] <zafooru> is this legolas' lego land?
[2:07:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> Soraka's Q is slower the further away it is from you. It slows and provides Health Regen for you.
[2:07:14] <+Scevda> I member
[2:07:17] <%killfrost11> like that
[2:07:20] <@ShockzNDrawe> I like Soraka's design
[2:07:24] <ErinTheInkeeper> @AngriestPat try to place it centered right behind them so the run back into it
[2:07:26] <%enickma11> oh wow this man is a turret
[2:07:30] <%ledgefiendd> good play, your opponent messed up
[2:07:33] <Mister_McDerp> doing good so far
[2:07:35] <mackonslaught> You're doing great Pat
[2:07:37] <%mungdip> Ward river
[2:07:38] <%killfrost11> good heal
[2:07:39] <%DatGuyJimbo> dont forget to auto attack in fights
[2:07:40] <+Kise77> Pat are you going to be watching the FF Live Letter in an hour?
[2:07:41] <usurper_sos> Good job
[2:07:42] <Beheziel> jesus that lifesteal
[2:07:49] <tegas_> The best part about soraka is if they don't kill you there you come out ahead.
[2:07:51] <%SilentEric> After landing your Q, use your heal on your ally to give him a better heal.
[2:07:52] <+Grayhammatter> he wants that leash
[2:07:54] <+EdenOfLove> Why is he just dancing around
[2:07:56] <vingadivo> good poke
[2:07:57] <%Skittlesoul> feed! thats the thing we want right?
[2:08:00] <%freezydude> No
[2:08:01] <$Instagig> Silence
[2:08:01] <BlackermanZX> Silence
[2:08:01] <+kingofcinders> Hitting your Q will give you a heal of time, W will heal others AND transfer your Q heal over to them if you have it. E is a big aoe silence that will root if enemies stay in it. R is a global heal that will heal more at low hp.
[2:08:03] <%SilentEric> It silences
[2:08:03] <%freezydude> it's a silence
[2:08:03] <+xddddsorandom> It silences
[2:08:04] <%Vegaburd> its a silence
[2:08:04] <xstormyone> no
[2:08:04] <%wujak> silence
[2:08:04] <trombonechemist8> it silences
[2:08:05] <%enickma11> Its a silence
[2:08:06] <rnyeeeezus> it silences
[2:08:07] <%freezydude> It's an AOE silence
[2:08:08] <%1matheuw> nah
[2:08:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @commanderclaw Everytime I catch your name out the corner of my eye I think I just typed something without realizing it and I just realized how crazy that thought actually is.
[2:08:11] <%freezydude> that roots after a time
[2:08:12] <pectusumbra> it silences and if they stay in it it's a root
[2:08:15] <+CaptainJax> Silence that roots at the end
[2:08:16] <vingadivo> it stuns at end of ability
[2:08:18] <%SilentEric> Watch out for that Thresh hook
[2:08:18] <rnyeeeezus> it roots if they stau in it
[2:08:22] <+Knifefarty> e is instant also!
[2:08:23] <weirdmothgirl> The way this chat rapidly swaps between "great job" and "stop feeding" is reminiscent of that old CS:GO "where's the bomb" clip

[2:11:19] <mackonslaught> It's ok I see silver/gold players that don't understand minion aggro
[2:11:19] <LeafarOznolam> the rat has proximity stealth
[2:11:20] <koolaid_kevster> he wasn't gonna live
[2:11:22] <%BeardedLuchador> Soraka cannot really 1v1 fight
[2:11:25] <vigilantic> which is good*
[2:11:26] <+Scevda> He bought shoes lol
[2:11:27] <lvl10cybermancer> He doesn't have enough gold to buy
[2:11:29] <@ShockzNDrawe> which he's admited he's only played her like twice now
[2:11:29] <%killfrost11> hes trying his best you all had to learn at some point too fuckers
[2:11:31] <$Instagig> rip
[2:11:32] <$Instagig> stealing cs
[2:11:45] <Div_the_Penguin> call missing
[2:11:50] <%ButterMyBrisket> he's doing alright
[2:11:51] <$FrogROOT> rookie makes rookie mistake forsenJoy 👌
[2:11:52] <tegas_> Are we gonna scrutinize every move?
[2:11:52] <%BeardedLuchador> Kappa right?!
[2:11:53] <$Instagig> That's league
[2:11:53] <wafflegear> calm down support takes bit
[2:11:55] <+kingofcinders> @FrogROOT ADC - Attack Damage Carry, generally ranged Marksmen. They are *supposed* to be the consistent damage dealers of a team.
[2:11:55] <$Instagig> So
[2:11:59] <BlackermanZX> Holy shit that hook was close
[2:11:59] <Mister_McDerp> of course, no one is actually bad
[2:12:00] <@ShockzNDrawe> It's cuz you're a big gamer man
[2:12:02] <%Gogogolem> yeah pat stop trolling
[2:12:02] <%BeardedLuchador> League in a nutshell
[2:12:02] <+Scevda> I learned with a friend in private. Play stupid games win stupid prizes
[2:12:09] <+xddddsorandom> Doing something wrong in LoL people will always say you're trolling
[2:12:11] <+xddddsorandom> it's true
[2:12:11] <koolaid_kevster> get vision wards and scanner for trinket to help against toxic rat
[2:12:13] <%OhioNitsud> OhioNitsud subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Is that one of them there mobers?
[2:12:14] <Mister_McDerp> everyone online is a pro
[2:12:14] <@ShockzNDrawe> who routinely talks about shitting his pants
[2:12:17] <@ShockzNDrawe> must be a troll
[2:12:20] <%BeardedLuchador> Nothing can ever be due to skill, must be a troll
[2:12:21] <damascussteele> @killfrost11 dont call us bitched 30 ppl told him to go back and he didnt
[2:12:23] <mackonslaught> I shit my pants
[2:12:24] <yourliteraldog> It is you can be sp bad that people think your griefing
[2:12:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> You are much too skilled at this to be messing up, so you must be messing with us
[2:12:30] <mackonslaught> oh god it's everywhere
[2:12:31] <%Fenrirlives> to be fair, Pat projects a palpable aura of smugness
[2:12:34] <$FrogROOT> its you :)
[2:12:34] <trombonechemist8> Thresh's passive
[2:12:36] <$Instagig> That's thresh passive
[2:12:36] <xstormyone> being bad and griefing look exactly alike in mobers
[2:12:36] <Lavistgame> Its a weird concept to have in moba games tbh,like not everyone is plat lvl
[2:12:37] <Lithdoran> The word 'trolling' has been so totally corrupted it means nothing anymore
[2:12:39] <lvl10cybermancer> Thresh souls

[2:13:30] <%BeardedLuchador> Calm down chat Kappa
[2:13:30] <+kingofcinders> Look at their health bars on the bottom right and hit R when someone is low, it heals for more below 40% hp. It's like healing in an MMO.
[2:13:30] <%freezydude> APHELIOS HAD LIKE 80% HP
[2:13:31] <mackonslaught> You're doing great reading the abilities
[2:13:32] <%freezydude> LOL

[2:13:34] <+xddddsorandom> NO YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I KNOW
[2:13:35] <+Ozztynn> check champion screen before going into the match
[2:13:35] <Fro5tburn> imagine not being able to read faster than the speed of light OMEGALUL
[2:13:40] <theKingRamses> can't read so i'll just hit the button
[2:13:41] <dragonslayingronin> pat you were soaking xp yeah right
[2:13:42] <therealtacopancakes> we're not complaining pat, just telling
[2:13:43] <%THATGUY_789> read faster
[2:13:45] <usurper_sos> illiterate streamer
[2:13:45] <@ShockzNDrawe> Is there any way you can read up on the skills of your character before you que up?
[2:13:47] <%Binary_Fireball> yes let the rage consume you
[2:13:48] <%didyouthinkofthis> didyouthinkofthis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[2:13:49] <+Scevda> No
[2:13:51] <%1matheuw> reed fester dummi
[2:13:51] <%SilentEric> Ult if anyone is low based on health bars above mini map
[2:13:52] <%freezydude> @ShockzNDrawe you totally can.
[2:13:54] <%Binary_Fireball> embrace the dark side
[2:13:56] <$Jmann1892> Thanks for the HahaPoint @didyouthinkofthis
[2:13:57] <@ShockzNDrawe> that way you have a general idea what everything does before you start
[2:13:59] <%Binary_Fireball> slowly but surely
[2:14:02] <lvl10cybermancer> GOTTEM
[2:14:03] <%SilentEric> NICE JOB
[2:14:04] <Div_the_Penguin> throw bananas
[2:14:07] <+2DSuperiority> learn by error, but never make errors
[2:14:07] <BlackermanZX> Good shit
[2:14:07] <usurper_sos> GOT
[2:14:08] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[2:14:12] <kazadog> has anybody in chat actually know what aphelios does? cbf reading 3 pages of text for one ability
[2:14:13] <+obeseninja12> Hey Pat, something you might want to turn on is to show mana costs on your abilities
[2:14:14] <@ShockzNDrawe> try that then next time
[2:14:15] <LeafarOznolam> Want a face roll?
[2:14:15] <mackonslaught> Soraka's good when you just want to chill and see other people feed Kappa
[2:14:18] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> To be fair, you should have printed out all this and studied it ahead of time. You need to read some rules of the road before you get behind the wheel of a car, after all
[2:14:18] <LeafarOznolam> Play SOna
[2:14:18] <Lithdoran> Pat's response to 'read before you get in a match' is 'WELL THEN I GUESS I'LL JUST STOP STREAMING
[2:14:23] <%Fenrirlives> we are just telling you pat
[2:14:23] <+Scevda> @shockzndrawe tons of ways
[2:14:27] <%ButterMyBrisket> nice
[2:14:27] <%ledgefiendd> @AngriestPat one thing you do better than most beginners is auto attack between spells
[2:14:32] <%DatGuyJimbo> guys whos that adc havnt played in a while
[2:14:33] <+xddddsorandom> AngriestPat You came into this stream saying "League isn't really toxic" and people in chat took that as a challenge
[2:14:34] <Mister_McDerp> never help
[2:14:36] <+DaoistSensei> don't lol
[2:14:38] <%SilentEric> If you use W right after hitting with Q, you give more healing and movement speed to them.
[2:14:38] <+Ozztynn> minions dont hit middle of lane until 1:35 in read up on skils before then
[2:14:40] <Katmon27> maybe pat will like engage supports like leona
[2:14:42] <+crackheadcontrol> @kazadog he's got a gun that slows/snares, a boomerang that sets up turrets, a sniper rifle, and an aoe flamethrower.
[2:14:42] <+Scevda> @ledgefiendd truth
[2:14:45] <kazadog> @DatGuyJimbo aphelios released earlier this week
[2:14:45] <%freezydude> @Jack_of_No_Trades oh come on, noones asking him to print out shit. but you can take a moment to fully read your abilities.
[2:14:50] <+Fei_Dragoon> This guy walks like jihn
[2:14:51] <Quite_Dapper> don't help push wave until you understand wave manipulating better
[2:14:52] <%OhioNitsud> !iuptime
[2:14:54] <theobble> XIV live letter in an hour.
[2:14:58] <%DatGuyJimbo> @kazadog thanks!
[2:15:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> in a lot of cases you'll actually throw off the adc when theyre trying to farm so just lay back and do recon
[2:15:04] <+Scevda> @freezydude truth
[2:15:11] <+sp_abadidea> Towers are back to shooting bolts? I remember when they were concentrated beams =U
[2:15:11] <%OhioNitsud> !uptime

[2:15:30] <BlackermanZX> Good save
[2:15:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @freezydude Im just giving him a hard time. No one is asking that, but that is actually how I would go about this (which is why I don't play these games I guess)
[2:15:31] <ape_hawk> nice escape

[2:17:41] <+Deko_> Dont waste your E
[2:17:45] <BlackermanZX> Yeah
[2:17:51] <%freezydude> Hey pat, your Q gives you health regen when you hit an enemy champion.
[2:17:54] <+UnderseaMagic> how come Tresh looks like Leroy Smith
[2:17:57] <usurper_sos> You could take the tower
[2:17:58] <Fro5tburn> PogChamp

[2:18:03] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[2:18:03] <%KevinsLunchbox> GOOD JOB
[2:18:04] <+kingofcinders> You should swap to a Red Trinket on your next back. The wards from your support item are the same as the Yellow Wards you begin with.
[2:18:06] <lvl10cybermancer> nice
[2:18:07] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat you can now switch your trinket to the red one to remove enemy wards
[2:18:07] <%secretspud> Nice job Pat
[2:18:08] <+Scevda> Gj

[2:18:16] <%Gogogolem> Good job pat
[2:18:19] <lvl10cybermancer> You're doing good
[2:18:23] <%KevinsLunchbox> doing the big good jobs pat
[2:18:25] <Haarute> we support boys
[2:18:25] <ape_hawk> yeah
[2:18:27] <vingadivo> pat is pretty good at soraka
[2:18:28] <BlackermanZX> Yep
[2:18:28] <scotty_jd> Good play
[2:18:29] <+kingofcinders> Grab a Sweeper so you can scout out enemy vision. :)
[2:18:29] <ape_hawk> soraka is a healbot
[2:18:29] <mackonslaught> Those were some really good W's Pat!
[2:18:30] <%SilentEric> Great Supporting Pat
[2:18:30] <+Deko_> soraka is the best

[2:18:37] <yourliteraldog> nanner rangs
[2:18:38] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat now you're seeing why some people hate fighting soraka
[2:18:39] <+Scevda> He really should keep to Support perhaps
[2:18:43] <+crackheadcontrol> I miss the good old days when soraka just gave free health and mana until the end of time
[2:18:51] <Tsuyi> When you complete your wards, change your trinket to the red one.
[2:18:53] <%SilentEric> So Pat, Q heals you, and W takes health to heal allies.
[2:18:54] <kruggalo> i have a friend whose played for 4 years and pat is a better support than him
[2:18:55] <vingadivo> the shield is from you runes
[2:18:56] <%Gogogolem> Yeah its nice they brought Luna over from dota 2
[2:18:58] <+crackheadcontrol> Good ol nanner fountain walking around with you
[2:18:58] <+sp_abadidea> who the heck is that new ADC? i cannot tell for the life of me what he's doing
[2:18:59] <+Deko_> support is great for learning the game
[2:18:59] <lvl10cybermancer> This is why league and dota both kind of moved away from having dedicated healers
[2:19:00] <+TheoShodi> Pat as healer... who knew....
[2:19:05] <toyforus235> you can build item with ability power
[2:19:08] <Fro5tburn> monkaS

[2:19:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat PAT NO DO IT BETTER THE WAY I WANT YOU TO PLAY!!! BE OMNIPOTENT! MEMORIZE EVERYTHING! D:< LUL
[2:19:18] <thatbandltguy> sweeper

[2:19:27] <%Fenrirlives> @angriestpat how does it feel to be WHM lmao!
[2:19:28] <shiny_prinny> buy the read thing, 4th item from the left top row

[2:19:34] <ape_hawk> good thing you have kayn carrying you
[2:19:35] <+kingofcinders> Sweeper, the big red icon that says FREE
[2:19:39] <usurper_sos> You are still doing well
[2:19:41] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat just be mindful of using W since it costs HEALTH
[2:19:41] <vigilantic> because you have an upgraded support item that places normal wards,you can replace your starting ward for blue ward(can be placed very far) or red (lets your team see invisible things for a short while) @angriestpat
[2:19:42] <+LeiteroMasta> ok now you is the time you flame your adc
[2:19:42] <tegas_> You're in the lead alls well
[2:19:42] <+Deko_> this is my PAT
[2:19:44] <BlackermanZX> Still doing pretty good
[2:19:46] <pitsuji> HA soraka
[2:19:50] <%Gogogolem> You're doing great for your second game as soraka.
[2:19:55] <$Jmann1892> Pat is doing really well
[2:19:56] <%DatGuyJimbo> is the boots
[2:19:56] <vingadivo> pat i recomend you buy an item called sweeping lens it lets you see invisible things like wards and the enemy adc
[2:19:57] <theKingRamses> that's ur boots i think
[2:19:57] <ape_hawk> boots of mobility, pat
[2:19:58] <%KevinsLunchbox> youve also got mobility boots
[2:19:59] <Katmon27> mobis
[2:19:59] <%freezydude> no you're just moving fast in general
[2:20:01] <shiny_prinny> that's your boots
[2:20:03] <%SilentEric> Towards wounded allies
[2:20:08] <vingadivo> you boots are fast boots
[2:20:09] <%freezydude> read your passive though.
[2:20:13] <+MisterCrimson> Look on the brightside, Pat. As a support, you're expected to have a low K/D
[2:20:13] <+xddddsorandom> Ardent Censor "+60 ability power +10% cooldown reduction UNIQUE: +10% heal and shield power +50% base mana regeneration Passive UNIQUE: +8% movement speed UNIQUE: Heals and shields on allied champions enhance you and them with FRENZY for 6 seconds.

There's nice like, training sets out there with multiple of the same thing in increasing sizes, could be good to look into if you're trying to work your way up!

[2:46:16] <%wujak> maybe if you ran towards the tower, but probably not
[2:46:16] <Twoiis> Flash could have been better.
[2:46:17] <%BeardedLuchador> That's nutty even for a lowbie game
[2:46:17] <%ButterMyBrisket> maybe if you ran to tower instead
[2:46:17] <Finchit> flashed towards tower
[2:46:17] <@ShockzNDrawe> oh
[2:46:18] <%bevyrage> very little, but it would have been for nothing

[2:46:25] <+Estuko> @babrukus ty for the advice! I will! <3
[2:46:25] <tegas_> You flashed a bit early maybe but maybe you were screwed either way.
[2:46:28] <%ledgefiendd> if you saved your flash to cross a wall or get in turret range, you had a chance @AngriestPat
[2:46:29] <Mister_McDerp> gonna be one of THOSE games

[2:54:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> is this the LoL version of tunneling
[2:54:06] <tegas_> You want to move towards your turret.

[2:57:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Chat sodium content = high
[2:57:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I think so. Reading what people have suggested in multiple forums etc.

[2:57:30] <ravencloak13> Lead Yoricks wall a bit more cause of how fast SInged can get.
[2:57:30] <CirclesForever> just get minions now
[2:57:32] <TBFeric> Pat needs boomer mods, someone make one like the phones with text size 48
[2:57:38] <tegas_> As long as minions aren't on his turrets he can poke at him a bit.
[2:57:42] <usurper_sos> Stop fighting him
[2:57:44] <CirclesForever> ignore singed, hes too big now
[2:57:47] <+MurlinDurl> that stinky boi is a big trouble
[2:57:47] <%linSP> one toss and there half hp
[2:57:48] <umm_idunno> hes fed
[2:57:48] <Mister_McDerp> hes good
[2:57:50] <filialpails> RUTHLESS DILDO IS UNSTOPPABLE
[2:57:50] <NotLysander> Singed is very matchup oriented
[2:57:51] <tegas_> He got early jungle support.
[2:57:52] <%l3sovikk> Playing Singed is an art
[2:57:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's because he's playing him good
[2:57:52] <+Jekado> everytime i see ruthless dildo i'm like how is that allowed
[2:57:53] <xstormyone> this guy is good
[2:57:55] <ape_hawk> theres an art to playing singed
[2:57:55] <%Ninestempest> well you gave him 3 kills
[2:57:55] <+2DSuperiority> big fed
[2:57:56] <tegas_> It makes a big difference.
[2:57:56] <BlackermanZX> He is playing smart
[2:57:57] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> To play Singed, you must become the ultimate piece of shit
[2:57:57] <+Grayhammatter> singed is too big
[2:57:57] <Lithdoran> Yorick doesn't do burst damage
[2:57:57] <%Gogogolem> Yorikcs weak to singed
[2:57:57] <%freezydude> He got early jungle advantage
[2:57:59] <trulythedude> cuz ur bad
[2:57:59] <NotLysander> you gotta know how to play against specific people
[2:57:59] <EndgameContent> It's because you're plauing Yorick
[2:58:00] <%freezydude> and he's playing smart
[2:58:00] <usurper_sos> you fed him
[2:58:01] <pitsuji> its because hes better than you
[2:58:01] <Jontman42> He knows when to go in and when to now

[2:58:07] <TBFeric> it's experience man, just gotta play and learn
[2:58:07] <%linSP> hes SUPER fat

[2:58:09] <%SashaStarshine> Singed is a smurf
[2:58:10] <usurper_sos> you fed him my man
[2:58:10] <%SilentEric> Singed is a rat bastard
[2:58:10] <+Deko_> LUL
[2:58:11] <%SoFarFetched> 5 is bigger than 3 LUL
[2:58:11] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:58:12] <CirclesForever> thats what items do
[2:58:13] <Finchit> welcome to the top lane zone
[2:58:14] <HoboCabs> oh my
[2:58:15] <theobble> singed is so fed
[2:58:16] <%SashaStarshine> Singed is an obvious Smurf Pat
[2:58:17] <Yubul> It's a bad matchup and he got an early gank.
[2:58:17] <simulationbard> He's only got 4 kills tho
[2:58:18] <Mister_McDerp> oh thats ok then'
[2:58:20] <%Big_Dream> Grey screen stream
[2:58:21] <pitsuji> man the chat he muted must fucking hate him
[2:58:22] <%WhereIsWill> top is FED AF WOOLIE
[2:58:27] <xstormyone> im gonna go play an unranked singed game
[2:58:29] <vingadivo> hes definitely a singed smurf pat just dont fight and stay under turret
[2:58:30] <+Deko_> Why is the game black and white only
[2:58:31] <+Jekado> i think that dildo is fed as shit too
[2:58:31] <Oxybe> bu less then 7 kills tho
[2:58:31] <+Elky3> @AngriestPat remeber to use your pots ;)
[2:58:32] <Finchit> this is optimal top lane experience
[2:58:34] <thorzimeron> laning's over, find your team mate
[2:58:35] <spinbel> you got outplayed and outsmarted
[2:58:35] <%houhilburn> TOP IS FED
[2:58:38] <%RayDaug> getting some Patshinshin going on
[2:58:42] <%mungdip> Hug tower and farm bb
[2:58:44] <ravencloak13> I'm suprised you aren't good with SInged given his game plan is to be a massive fuck ass that goes in and runs away and just poisons your team to death.
[2:58:44] <%freezydude> What?
[2:58:47] <%freezydude> it heals plenty!
[2:58:50] <CirclesForever> no
[2:58:51] <+nvrwhr> Don't forget to pop your pots
[2:58:51] <Yubul> They're more for early game.
[2:58:52] <Fro5tburn> this gonna be a rough rest of the game monkaS
[2:58:53] <%freezydude> it's an early game item pat
[2:58:53] <$HogHoncho> theyre for early game
[2:58:55] <%NSwarmlord> use them when in fights
[2:58:57] <vingadivo> no
[2:58:58] <%daemonazaezal> ive been out of league forever
[2:58:59] <CirclesForever> they heal over time
[2:58:59] <%SilentEric> Its early game sustain
[2:59:00] <shiny_prinny> they are for early game, not big damage
[2:59:00] <+Quack_of_Dawn> It heals plenty you're just getting poisoned
[2:59:00] <%freezydude> it's literally a starting item
[2:59:00] <%Ninestempest> they heal plenty, but it's over time and hard to see in a fight
[2:59:01] <BlackermanZX> Early game pots
[2:59:01] <%daemonazaezal> who is he playing
[2:59:03] <+Baekon01> they heal a lot at early levels
[2:59:03] <%SashaStarshine> It's super impactful at high levels
[2:59:04] <+theman515> Yeah they're meant for like level 1 or 2
[2:59:05] <xstormyone> corrupting is like 400 health
[2:59:05] <%freezydude> and it refilled at base.
[2:59:07] <%Bailey__gaming> hey pat hope you are ok
[2:59:08] <Yubul> 150 HP is a lot when your health pool is only 600-900.
[2:59:08] <%daemonazaezal> is that yorick redo?
[2:59:09] <%ledgefiendd> after 15 minutes they get less meaningful
[2:59:14] <%freezydude> It heals p l e n t y
[2:59:18] <%ledgefiendd> singed also damaged hard through the pot
[2:59:22] <%freezydude> That's 375 health pat
[2:59:22] <Twoiis> Bad habit of being married to your lane.
[2:59:22] <xstormyone> 125 3 times
[2:59:23] <+Jekado> pat generally doesn't like using pots because they are one time use
[2:59:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> They can help offset the poison damage a little.
[2:59:23] <Finchit> 125 x 3
[2:59:24] <simulationbard> It's for early game lane sustain they're very rarely going to save you in a fight after laning phase
[2:59:24] <+Xalgar> jermaOneguy
[2:59:26] <CirclesForever> upgrade it
[2:59:26] <theKingRamses> 3 charges x 125
[2:59:26] <Mister_McDerp> jermaOneguy
[2:59:26] <%SashaStarshine> 375 total
[2:59:29] <Reodi> the singed is also set up with tank runes.He has aftershock so when he throws you he shits out a damage AoE
[2:59:33] <+tuchpi> 125 x 3 :)
[2:59:33] <usurper_sos> 3 times
[2:59:36] <%freezydude> Pat this is a starting item
[2:59:38] <+Jekado> tho i think that singh is using pots up that wazoo
[2:59:39] <EndgameContent> Throw your ult at bot
[2:59:41] <%Ninestempest> well if you need 300 health use it 3 times
[2:59:42] <thorzimeron> the pings man jesus, laning's over
[2:59:42] <$FrogROOT> HELP Pepega
[2:59:43] <EndgameContent> And then split top
[2:59:44] <shiny_prinny> mute their pings
[2:59:55] <theobble> singed top
[2:59:56] <xstormyone> and thats alot
[2:59:56] <%freezydude> You use them during skirmishes pat @AngriestPat
[2:59:57] <Yubul> Potion healing also doesn't stack. You can drink three and you'll only get the benefit of one.
[2:59:57] <simulationbard> Singed is proxy farming
[2:59:59] <%ledgefiendd> its contextual lol
[2:59:59] <%moogleboy1984> it's a HoT
[3:00:01] <%Gogogolem> Singed is confident
[3:00:02] <%SashaStarshine> You use them to be topped off
[3:00:02] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat jermaOneguy
[3:00:04] <%l3sovikk> read what the corrupting potion does
[3:00:09] <Fro5tburn> F

[3:00:14] <$FrogROOT> welp
[3:00:15] <+ktothec99> Whenever I watch League I forget you can't deny
[3:00:17] <usurper_sos> Depends on context Pat
[3:00:22] <%Ninestempest> PAT
[3:00:26] <spinbel> he can read!
[3:00:26] <Finchit> I can tell that chat isnt really helping LUL
[3:00:26] <%AncelDeLambert> THE REST
[3:00:27] <tegas_> The healing doesn't stack if that's what we are getting at.
[3:00:27] <@JustinianKnight> oooof real bad one lol

[3:00:29] <usurper_sos> PAT

[3:00:29] <%Ninestempest> THE REST OF IT IS WHY YOU USE IT IN A FIGHT
[3:00:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Alexa, play Toxicity by System of A Down
[3:00:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> READ THE REST
[3:00:32] <%freezydude> ITS AN EARLY GAME, STARTING ITEM
[3:00:32] <xstormyone> pat learned to surrender

[3:00:34] <CirclesForever> its a starting item
[3:00:35] <%freezydude> YOU USE IT DURING FIGHTS
[3:00:35] <%daemonazaezal> it burns enemies
[3:00:36] <thatbandltguy> READ PAT
[3:00:37] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat ONE GUY jermaOneguy
[3:00:37] <%BlackJack607> Is he trying to trigger us?
[3:00:37] <%freezydude> FOR DOT DAMAGE
[3:00:37] <+Ziekwalt> Remember this is a strategy game NOT a fighting game youre suppose to be out on the map not seeing grey
[3:00:40] <Sonbunns> it doesnt stack
[3:00:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you read half of it
[3:00:41] <%moogleboy1984> over 12 seconds you manchild
[3:00:43] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Later on I usually pop them all at once
[3:00:45] <vingadivo> you use one wait use another wait then use the third one
[3:00:46] <Cedgewik> he tilted
[3:00:47] <Node_One> Patthew, my brotherman...

[3:00:48] <%houhilburn> WhY iSnT mY StarTInG ItEm HeAliNg Me thrOuGH tHe MiD GaMe
[3:00:49] <Warbot40> Pat needs a mentor
[3:00:49] <KSGregg> D:

[3:00:52] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> it doesnt stack and it gives you DOT
[3:00:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There's a suggestion for windows resolution /desktop scaling. Have you tried that yet?

[3:01:13] <%jarednotwithsubway> How goes it?
[3:01:13] <@JustinianKnight> I muted em all after a bit
[3:01:13] <%ledgefiendd> Im sorry pat
[3:01:14] <Jarvanii> you use them if you need them
[3:01:16] <%NSwarmlord> You use them when in the middle of fighting
[3:01:16] <xstormyone> use them as you fight
[3:01:18] <%ButterMyBrisket> pat needs one of those 1800s binoculars to see the tv text
[3:01:18] <usurper_sos> It depends on the situation
[3:01:19] <%moogleboy1984> the HoT doesn't stack, so you don't use them all at once
[3:01:19] <Mister_McDerp> jermaOneguy jermaOneguy jermaOneguy
[3:01:19] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat ONE GUY
[3:01:21] <%SashaStarshine> Chat stupid UwU
[3:01:21] <%dave323dave> one guy
[3:01:21] <oceanbed98> Even people that play this game do not like it. Don't stress.
[3:01:24] <%Ninestempest> One person said that pat
[3:01:25] <thorzimeron> it heals little halfway through the game
[3:01:25] <%ledgefiendd> we love you pat azaxeHug
[3:01:26] <%Ninestempest> one fucking person
[3:01:28] <%freezydude> Literaly
[3:01:28] <CirclesForever> it heals a meaningful amount early
[3:01:29] <%freezydude> One person
[3:01:29] <Rhinoprotoss> You regen the health
[3:01:30] <%freezydude> said that
[3:01:31] <$FrogROOT> Pepega
[3:01:32] <@JustinianKnight> had the one really good match tho
[3:01:32] <%VantomPayne> meanwhile ignoring everyone saying its an early game item for the laning phase
[3:01:33] <usurper_sos> use them consecutively
[3:01:34] <+UnderseaMagic> you can't fool us pat, we all know you're just twitch acting
[3:01:34] <%houhilburn> one person
[3:01:35] <+guitarburst05> even pat viewers get toxic when LoL is on, jeez guys
[3:01:36] <Kain5707> @theobble i think its at 1130
[3:01:37] <Warbot40> Twitch chat is too messy for advice, he needs a decent mentor.
[3:01:38] <xstormyone> thats alot of health for 500 gold is the thing , its relative
[3:01:38] <NotLysander> Can you see why everyone hates this fucking game? lol
[3:01:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you have to wait for them to heal you
[3:01:41] <%Ninestempest> Pat is just trying to trigger us now
[3:01:43] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatLiz
[3:01:43] <+Ziekwalt> Also helps to not eat unnecessary damage
[3:01:44] <kazadog> the stacks still heal the same per tick just lasts 3x longer
[3:01:45] <+Andrizzleton> chat IS one person
[3:01:45] <ravencloak13> You don't use them all at once you pop one then after the first one turns off you pop the other.
[3:01:46] <%NSwarmlord> because they extra 125 hp in the middle of the fight is life or death in cases
[3:01:47] <+Rhan_> Strawman andy
[3:01:47] <%SilentEric> If you use them all at once they que rather than working concurrently.
[3:01:50] <%SoFarFetched> The salt just seeps through infecting chat LUL
[3:01:52] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat I love everyone here ,we can always rely on each other in these trying times :) :)
[3:01:54] <EdwardGreene1> Hey Pat have you tried putting on the setting that shows mana costs on the ability icons?
[3:01:54] <+Scevda> Obtuse orb
[3:01:55] <%houhilburn> WE ARE CHAT, WE ARE ONE
[3:01:56] <theobble> @Kain5707 you right it is
[3:01:56] <%freezydude> It's 500 gold pat.
[3:01:56] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat They don't stack, so if you use all three of them at the same time it'll just be one long potion.
[3:01:56] <trulythedude> fuck league anyway
[3:01:57] <%Bailey__gaming> I turned up at the right time I guess lol
[3:01:58] <CirclesForever> and it refills for free
[3:02:01] <shiny_prinny> yeah it's cost efficient
[3:02:02] <%daemonazaezal> it recharges at base
[3:02:03] <tegas_> Yeah
[3:02:04] <Yubul> exactly.
[3:02:04] <%SilentEric> So you'd have to heal over like a minute.
[3:02:05] <vingadivo> BUT YOU DONT USE ALL AT ONCE PAT you have to wait for the healing efect to pass to use the 2 charge then the 3
[3:02:05] <thorzimeron> yes
[3:02:05] <BlackermanZX> yes
[3:02:05] <%daemonazaezal> yep
[3:02:06] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[3:02:06] <%freezydude> it refills for free.
[3:02:06] <%Ninestempest> Yup
[3:02:06] <tegas_> That's how it works.
[3:02:06] <xeros720> pat, it's a HoT, you aren't getting that
[3:02:07] <Fro5tburn> League is honestly a terrible game to stream when you're learning. Chat gets crazy

[3:02:11] <+nvrwhr> Great game
[3:02:12] <$FrogROOT> NO
[3:02:12] <Tyrimat> It also refills when you back
[3:02:13] <%freezydude> they DONT stack they queue.
[3:02:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> you should only read advice from people who are right

[3:02:22] <Yubul> Healing doesn't stack, it just extends the duration.
[3:02:22] <thorzimeron> stacks duration not potency
[3:02:22] <%SoFarFetched> @Valdorick surrendered
[3:02:23] <%freezydude> YOUR JUST READING IT WRONG

[3:02:46] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> They queue up, you don't get the the buff x2 you get it once then again
[3:02:47] <+Scevda> They are in agreement you ginger fuxk
[3:02:48] <+Andrizzleton> stack would mean they're simultaneous

[3:03:07] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> think of it like 125 + 125 not 250
[3:03:08] <artificiallynatural> First guy explained it properly, just called it stack rather than queue, and chat is now freaking out
[3:03:10] <%houhilburn> apatHoldon
[3:03:10] <xeros720> queuing sounds nice
[3:03:13] <Rhinoprotoss> But he's not using it
[3:03:18] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> if that makes sense
[3:03:19] <%Kiwami_gaim> i want that shirt
[3:03:21] <kazadog> Pat has a knack for reading the guy who is wrong in chat then getting confused when everyone corrects that guy
[3:03:21] <Oxybe> pat needs to get a premade team
[3:03:22] <usurper_sos> Love a good queue

[3:04:10] <%dasmause> @AngriestPat youre taking advice from goddamn twitch chat pat, why are you angry no one has anything of value to say?
[3:04:10] <+Emperor_Bad> just stick one of those gameboy magnifier lights on your screen
[3:04:13] <%Fenrirlives> @justinianknight you are good teammate Merry Christmas!
[3:04:13] <usurper_sos> Use a magnifying glass
[3:04:14] <simulationbard> Have you tried wearing binoculars
[3:04:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I had no idea. I'm genuinely trying to find suggestions and resolve it for you. :)

[3:04:20] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Cheer250 Anyway hope you enjoyed the prime Singed experience.
[3:04:23] <Renkage> I don't know. But I do
[3:04:25] <Yubul> Alright boys, let's take it to the League subreddit. If enough people riot about the text size they'll add the feature to scale it.
[3:04:25] <Oxybe> @angriestpat we need to get you a premade team so you can chucklefuck with friends
[3:04:27] <cassiecagedd> Chat is dumb

[3:04:42] <tactician0> cirTan
[3:04:43] <%Bailey__gaming> Hey Pat did you at least have fun tonight?
[3:04:43] <%Ausk> have you tried vlad?

[3:04:54] <@JustinianKnight> yea my fault probably
[3:04:55] <Mister_McDerp> that sucks
[3:04:56] <+Scevda> Hows elise these days?
[3:04:56] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat that is 5V5
[3:04:58] <%moogleboy1984> that sounds about right
[3:04:58] <tegas_> The match making for new teams is fucked.
[3:04:58] <%linSP> that's what happens
[3:04:59] <+Xalgar> Level doesn't mean anything LUL
[3:05:00] <%Ninestempest> jesus
[3:05:03] <+guitarburst05> if you 5-man, THEY 5-man.. that could be worse
[3:05:05] <Oxybe> wow
[3:05:07] <%linSP> tell your friends to make smurf accounts just for youuu
[3:05:07] <%SashaStarshine> It only looks for a 5 man
[3:05:08] <+Jekado> 5 manning in Lol is pretty terrible
[3:05:08] <TBFeric> yeah its a common match-making fuckery. Overwatch does that garbage too
[3:05:11] <thorzimeron> yeah normal matchmaking is booty asscheeks
[3:05:11] <%Ninestempest> Level means a lot when it's 300+ vs Pat not being 30 yet
[3:05:12] <%freezydude> If you 5 man they 5man
[3:05:14] <$FrogROOT> they hacked
[3:05:15] <@JustinianKnight> cuz some of these dudes are high too
[3:05:18] <ravencloak13> It just means how much they played.
[3:05:19] <%NSwarmlord> You're playing with people who are rusty rather than the kind of people who would nolife the game
[3:05:20] <%freezydude> it just matches the team size
[3:05:21] <zayasu> i mean it does if you're new
[3:05:21] <NotLysander> level means alot at pats level
[3:05:21] <%SoFarFetched> Level always sometimes never means anything LUL
[3:05:22] <%BeardedLuchador> +
[3:05:24] <xstormyone> there are very few 5 mans so you will get bad matches
[3:05:25] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Means about as much as Overwatch, which is not much than play time
[3:05:27] <BlackermanZX> Level does mean something because they played a shit ton
[3:05:27] <%mungdip> He needs practice. He’ll get there
[3:05:28] <DrFacilier> im level 90 and i still cant last hit
[3:05:29] <Yubul> 300+ is easily a hundred hours of playtime vs Pat's probably like 12.
[3:05:29] <+Grayhammatter> that's some chucklefuckery
[3:05:31] <TBFeric> If you 6 stack in overwatch you get put against 6 solo master players, its fucked
[3:05:33] <%QuadraticGravity> "LEVEL DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING" i scream, as I get slammed into an egg roll
[3:05:33] <%lvl_1_steve> dudes can suck and be level 500 Iron 4 but theyll be smarter to the game slightly more than pat
[3:05:33] <Fenrirlives> TIME TO SMURF BABYYYY
[3:05:34] <ravencloak13> Level only matters to get the flash and teleport summoner spells.
[3:05:35] <%BeardedLuchador> A Bronze player @ level 500 is going to be better than a bronze player at level 50
[3:05:37] <EdwardGreene1> EdwardGreene1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:05:39] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat you gona have the better time if you play with duo for single when is 5v5 the match matching get weird.
[3:05:40] <Renkage> @AngriestPat 5 man of all the same level? Or 5 man of levels 15-500?
[3:05:42] <%bubuche666> No you need to duo queue with a guy chatting with you to mentor you a bit, that would be better than the chaos of the chat
[3:05:43] <+HyraFukit> Was Pat serious about not streaming Pathologic 2 again?
[3:05:48] <%BeardedLuchador> They may both still be Bronze, but the level 500 still has more experience
[3:05:55] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat is better if you have a community game night
[3:05:56] <+Calamity2007> @HyraFukit Did he not like the game?
[3:05:58] <tegas_> Pat is doing fine he doesn't need to change anything.
[3:06:06] <@JustinianKnight> I played probably like 400+ hours but they didnt have above 30 back then

[3:06:44] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who gave less of a shit about desks
[3:06:46] <+Calamity2007> @HyraFukit It might be one of those situations where he would just prefer to play the game on his own time

[3:13:20] <archangel9889> I always like SMITE more than other mobas
[3:13:21] <%thegreatbambe> !uptime
[3:13:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 13m.
[3:13:22] <%yeknomlive> hey chat what do you think of smite
[3:13:22] <+Andrizzleton> Vi has come to
[3:13:23] <Silversunburst> did you ever play against shaco?
[3:13:25] <+EdenOfLove> what role do you have?
[3:13:30] <Dovakhin573> is teemo still annoying?
[3:13:35] <simulationbard> Yes
[3:13:35] <%BeardedLuchador> @angriestpat o/
[3:13:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @Kravus Like just run in and get murdered to fuck your team? :(
[3:13:46] <Kravus> Basically, yeah
[3:13:50] <%Agami23> yeah but brute justices theme
[3:13:51] <@JustinianKnight> RISE
[3:13:51] <%Fenrirlives> @justinianknight rip all of Skarn's old and busted skins lol
[3:13:53] <faldin> I recently did that and it was amazing
[3:13:55] <Dovakhin573> back in my day I would eat teemos with zac in top lane
[3:13:55] <%BeardedLuchador> Alexander is my favorite dungeon set
[3:13:56] <Renkage> What fucking Shaco uses flash? He's like one of the few that doesn't need it
[3:13:57] <%ledgefiendd> eyyyyy
[3:14:00] <CirclesForever> fun fact Vi's name means "6" because she has 6 toes on her foot
[3:14:01] <%freezydude> BIG DAWG
[3:14:02] <+mesirel> I've been looking into companion app creation for league for like an hour now to see if this problem can be fixed easy. riots API sucks
[3:14:03] <%ButterMyBrisket> big dogoo
[3:14:04] <thorzimeron> wish I had the money to keep up FFXIV rn, them fights are dope
[3:14:04] <@JustinianKnight> hes Anubis
[3:14:10] <%LaughingCatt> Croco right up there
[3:14:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @Kravus ... why would you do that? To "troll" or grief or something? Waste of everyone's time :|
[3:14:12] <+xddddsorandom> Anubis cane boy
[3:14:12] <%dasmause> my friend cleared ultimate alexander today after dropping her old shitty static
[3:14:19] <%ledgefiendd> auto auto attack off is a good choice
[3:14:20] <%Deano8817> @Renkage but TWO flashes tho
[3:14:20] <trombonechemist8> that's generally a good idea
[3:14:22] <Monicro> auto auto attack is actively detrimental
[3:14:22] <+Jekado> also why buy pots if you don't like using them are they free or something? @AngriestPat
[3:14:22] <%Typhaeon> Nice Paige Miss Fortune cosplay
[3:14:24] <shalashasknya> @AngriestPat About to start FF14 for the first time, what NA server would you recommend?
[3:14:25] <%SoFarFetched> Hey look Paige is on his team LUL
[3:14:27] <vingadivo> pat try and kite the jungoe camps so you lose less help it helps a lot especially against the big frog
[3:14:27] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Nasus is Anubis and his last hitting is real easy
[3:14:27] <42nfl19> Egyptian Dog dude..HIS Q CAN SCALE TO INFINITE
[3:14:30] <Monicro> i have no idea why its even an option
[3:14:33] <Monicro> let alone default on
[3:14:33] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> its good to have off anyways
[3:14:34] <simulationbard> @Dovakhin573 I just beat the crap out of a temmo support with Leona
[3:14:40] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat pressing S stops all actions so autoattacking your carries minions doesn't happen but what you do is smarter...
[3:14:40] <Yubul> Nasus is the definition of Number Go Up
[3:14:43] <%DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! Mid or feed
[3:14:45] <%ButterMyBrisket> consumables apatGoblin
[3:14:45] <+Th33KC> nasus has infinite damage stacking on his q
[3:14:46] <$FrogROOT> items suck
[3:14:49] <CirclesForever> auto attack is antiquated, its from rts's i think
[3:14:49] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat did you know you can press A and then click and you'll attack the thing closest to your cursor, so you dont have to be too accurate
[3:14:52] <+UnderseaMagic> shaco atpGasm
[3:14:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ButterMyBrisket Mind goblins
[3:14:54] <artificiallynatural> He fights the enemy AND his mind goblins
[3:14:55] <%AncelDeLambert> think of it as a fifth skill, that you buy
[3:14:55] <toyforus235> key bind
[3:14:57] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat I've been playing for years and I still forget them, don't feel bad :)
[3:14:59] <$FrogROOT> i share that mindgoblin pat
[3:15:00] <vingadivo> Nasus is big cool dog and his numbers go up
[3:15:03] <+atwitchical> Did pat try going into game.cfg?
[3:15:06] <42nfl19> PAT DO YOU LIKE BIG DAMAGE? FARM Q ON NASUS FOR ONE HIT KILL SQUISHES
[3:15:09] <+aslfrasle> @AngriestPat Is that because they are like temporary buffs?
[3:15:09] <+Baekon01> some items had active effects too
[3:15:11] <Renkage> Why are people talking about Nasus right now? There isn't Nasus on EITHER TEAM
[3:15:16] <%LaughingCatt> Nasus is the phrase "number go up" personified into a character
[3:15:20] <+Jekado> ah okay i thought you didn't like using them i get the same problem in HOTS for the 1,2 ,3 ,4 extra abilities @AngriestPat

[3:17:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm sardonic at fuck and I was actually getting worried at how legit tilted you were getting. O_o
[3:17:57] <BlackermanZX> Stealin' his shit is a boss move
[3:17:59] <%freezydude> @Jekado red gives onhit damage and a slow, blue gives mana regen and cooldown reduction
[3:18:00] <%SashaStarshine> @Quack_of_Dawn Luckilly Urgot is the one champion where you can just press W and afk around enemies

[3:18:05] <+Xalgar> Used potions PogChamp
[3:18:05] <tegas_> OSFrog

[3:18:09] <+Thelvl1king> Quick go for the invade, dab on em!
[3:18:09] <FirearmsInstructor> Why's Pat killing all the NPC things?
[3:18:12] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> @Jekado red buff gives a DOT burn and blue buff gives you 10% cooldown on abilites and mana regen
[3:18:12] <+xddddsorandom> OSFrog
[3:18:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Jekado same as always. DoT and mild slow for Red, Mana Regen and CD for blue

[3:18:25] <%chubbypencil> crab doesnt spawn till 3:15
[3:18:25] <+mesirel> @angriestpat after much googling I've determined the only way to fix this item text issue is with a windows accessibility setting called magnifier
[3:18:30] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Has he tried smartcast?
[3:18:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL

[3:20:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Big coward good, always be big coward.
[3:20:17] <Kravus> That was scary lol
[3:20:18] <tegas_> The spiciest path
[3:20:19] <%SilentEric> Nice job
[3:20:20] <%BeardedLuchador> I'm so scared rn Kappa
[3:20:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> Evelynn becomes invisible at level 6!
[3:20:20] <$Dakuu75> yeah, that's always the fear. getting counter-jungled with low hp
[3:20:21] <%Neryl_> @AngriestPat Still using Blitz?
[3:20:21] <Haarute> time your abilities to trigger your passive shield if possible
[3:20:22] <%Mekhet09> Eve can pretty much die in five seconds if you kill her before ult.
[3:20:24] <Rhinoprotoss> The heck
[3:20:25] <+MadPretty> Strong counter jungle tho
[3:20:25] <toyforus235> red pot
[3:20:25] <+napargonaga> Hoo boy, an invis hero, huh? How bad is she 1v1?
[3:20:26] <+Thelvl1king> Don’t kill them all leave the small ones
[3:20:27] <%Mekhet09> God her early game is so bad now.
[3:20:30] <Reodi> don't forget when you're low you can smite the monster to restore health
[3:20:32] <%daemonazaezal> When i was playing it wasnt a great plan to counter but patches may have changed that
[3:20:32] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat a tip is to sue her e to cancel her AA that way she does her next AA faster
[3:20:33] <Kravus> Against Renek....
[3:20:36] <Renkage> @AngriestPat Don't forget you can now Smite enemy champions with the item you just got
[3:20:37] <CirclesForever> she lets her hands toi the talking
[3:20:37] <vingadivo> pat if you let one of the raptors or krugs leave it really damages the enemy jungler
[3:20:40] <Kravus> As long as the croc isn't 6 yet
[3:20:43] <+MadPretty> Doesnt teemo beat ren early?
[3:20:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat if you have extra pocket change you should be buying pink wards
[3:20:48] <%freezydude> @FirearmsInstructor there's also the dragon camp in the bottom right river, which gives team buffs.
[3:20:51] <+stillsbury_doughboy> just remember eve is perma stealthed at lv 6
[3:21:01] <simulationbard> Real heroes use Ultimate Bravery Kappa
[3:21:04] <Oxybe> I keep thinking pat is talking about Blitzcrank
[3:21:04] <%arcaderabbit48> How have the games been going tonight?
[3:21:09] <+MoonlightP> pat took to jungling more than i expected
[3:21:11] <Yubul> Evelynn becomes nearly permanently camouflaged after Level 6. Remember to get a vision ward so you can track her better
[3:21:13] <vingadivo> evelynn will become perma invisible when she reaches level 6 pat
[3:21:20] <cassiecagedd> your team mate isnt there
[3:21:25] <%freezydude> @napargonaga Eve is an assassin so if she gets fed she can blow up people, she's pretty good.
[3:21:25] <%XxBTExX> good call
[3:21:26] <Silversunburst> Vi is hard to play for a beginner
[3:21:26] <BlackermanZX> Smart
[3:21:27] <vingadivo> yup
[3:21:27] <+xddddsorandom> that is true
[3:21:29] <Kravus> Yeah, Renek is lvl 6 now. Very scary
[3:21:29] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Without blue charge isn't worth it against normal camps
[3:21:32] <Monicro> hes learning Pog
[3:21:32] <%BeardedLuchador> I'm so proud
[3:21:33] <+Thelvl1king> I wanna watch him play Udyr

[3:21:38] <simulationbard> Good call
[3:21:38] <Rhinoprotoss> Renek gank?
[3:21:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Punch that monster's butt.
[3:21:42] <sxynoodle> he got lucky with jungle stealing and eve was ganking
[3:21:43] <+Xalgar> Level 6 Renekton monkaS
[3:21:46] <%SilentEric> You know about eating the river grapes right?
[3:21:49] <%Kiwami_gaim> every 3 hits she does % damage
[3:21:49] <%Mekhet09> Eve is pretty easy to kill before still.
[3:21:51] <artificiallynatural> I can't believe Pat is learnding
[3:21:51] <%freezydude> @napargonaga if she gets an advantage she can win really good
[3:21:51] <%Mekhet09> six

[3:22:31] <+Xalgar> Kreygasm

[3:22:33] <%BeardedLuchador> Eve CC
[3:22:34] <%XxBTExX> its a taunt
[3:22:34] <Yubul> She can charm you
[3:22:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Do the NPCs respawn for more EXP? Or permadeath?
[3:22:36] <$rottingcrawler> Oh no shit, where tf have i been lol.
[3:22:36] <+Quack_of_Dawn> That means "don't be near them
[3:22:36] <Node_One> Pat, I think you can use your smite move to slow the enemy jungler and hopefully make the kill! Yes! : )
[3:22:37] <tigerfang86> SUCC
[3:22:38] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat this is a bit advanced but you can Flash during the time you're charging Q to extend your range
[3:22:39] <%Gogogolem> She hit you with the Lesbian beam

[3:22:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> She can charge up a taunt on you
[3:22:45] <+xddddsorandom> If she hits you with an ability while that's on your head you become charmed
[3:22:56] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat evelyn can cast a debuff on you and when it pops if she hits you you are charmed twoards her

[3:23:00] <+GeneralHysterics> *has flash* there's no way to close this gap
[3:23:04] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Your red's back
[3:23:07] <VritraReiRei> @FirearmsInstructor you mean the jungle monsters? yes they respawn at a higher level so worth more gold and exp after killing them
[3:23:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @GeneralHysterics He had the problem of being not cowardly enough last time he played her, sssshhhh.
[3:23:20] <+Jekado> i dunno about this
[3:23:23] <%GunEden> full stak conq
[3:23:23] <+mmack093> Does league have more porn than overwatch?

[3:23:28] <Kravus> Yup, that's Renek
[3:23:28] <BlackermanZX> danb
[3:23:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mmack093 No
[3:23:29] <+MoonlightP> lol
[3:23:30] <zayasu> thats renekton LUL
[3:23:30] <Haarute> level difference.
[3:23:30] <Yubul> Teemo was literally asleep lmao
[3:23:32] <tegas_> Yeah hes strong early.
[3:23:33] <cassiecagedd> he is a big bad ass
[3:23:34] <lbrownthedestroyer> Anti tank
[3:23:34] <%ledgefiendd> renekton stronk
[3:23:34] <rarovan> Yea you uh.. hsouldn't have fought that
[3:23:35] <+MoonlightP> that's renekton for you
[3:23:35] <%daemonazaezal> ulti
[3:23:35] <%SashaStarshine> Renekton is CRAZY high on damage
[3:23:35] <ape_hawk> yeah, the gator can get bigger
[3:23:35] <+Jekado> i think you need to single for the gank to cordinate
[3:23:36] <NotLysander> in cases like that, run through to your turret, dont turn around
[3:23:36] <usurper_sos> Renekton kills fast
[3:23:36] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Remember that smiting a champion slows when it's blue
[3:23:36] <%SilentEric> Big croc man
[3:23:37] <%BeardedLuchador> lol
[3:23:37] <%Ninestempest> WHY WAS TEEMO IN MELEE RANGE
[3:23:38] <kazadog> thats renekton for you lol
[3:23:39] <vingadivo> he was level 7 pat
[3:23:40] <%ledgefiendd> ouch
[3:23:40] <CirclesForever> @AngriestPat buy items before the gank
[3:23:40] <+Jekado> he is like 2 levels higher
[3:23:42] <%daemonazaezal> his ult
[3:23:43] <%mungdip> That was on teemo
[3:23:43] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Renekton power spikes HARD
[3:23:43] <vernardohunk93> thats renekton, he does BULSHIT
[3:23:44] <+sp_abadidea> he flashed right over the mushroom hahaha
[3:23:46] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat evelyn gets scary at lvl 6 cuz she an be invisible
[3:23:47] <Jarvanii> teemo couldnt do shit
[3:23:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @mmack093 League has existed longer, so probably
[3:23:47] <Renkage> Teemo was hurt
[3:23:50] <+Jekado> cuz teemo backed already
[3:23:51] <Yubul> Teemo literally just watched you die
[3:23:52] <plzza_kun> he was almost dead
[3:23:53] <+WhatsGoingInTheToilet> how is the chat bigger? how do
[3:23:53] <usurper_sos> You are underleveled for Renek
[3:23:54] <theKingRamses> he got bodied before you got there
[3:23:55] <toyforus235> he got true damage
[3:23:55] <TBFeric> @AngriestPat I sent you a screenshot of how potions stack on twitter, hope it helps.
[3:23:56] <tegas_> Teemo was too low to do much safely.
[3:23:57] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat he's stronger than you, but Pat if you get behind someone like that it's wise to save your Q for when they start to run away from you.
[3:23:59] <%daemonazaezal> he was mostly dead
[3:24:02] <$xiomyu> cus hw had like 200 heath
[3:24:03] <%BeardedLuchador> You will find yourself asking that question MANY MANY MANY times
[3:24:03] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat a rule of thumb is not to gank pre lvl 6 to avoid stuff like that
[3:24:06] <vingadivo> teemo likely didn't see you because new players use camera locked
[3:24:08] <+napargonaga> Is there a courier, or do players have to make all purchases at the base?
[3:24:08] <%yeknomlive> threaten to feed
[3:24:08] <%daemonazaezal> and then showed up and died
[3:24:10] <Jarvanii> renekton is the king of 1v2
[3:24:10] <kazadog> dont know if teemo joining wouldve killed him honestly
[3:24:11] <+Xalgar> His blind must have been on CD
[3:24:13] <%freezydude> @napargonaga no courier
[3:24:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @napargonaga at base
[3:24:17] <mankeyfigh> Teemo was to dead already
[3:24:18] <Renkage> The part where he fucked up was he TRIED to help. Late. Then died
[3:24:19] <+mmack093> What has the most porn. League, Fate, or OverWatch
[3:24:20] <tegas_> That could've worked out by the better play was probably to farm to 6.
[3:24:23] <CirclesForever> @AngriestPat items give you the bigger number, use the bigger number
[3:24:24] <tegas_> but*
[3:24:24] <sxynoodle> cause top lane ppl don't look at their mini maps
[3:24:31] <Kravus> Bot lane is smashing at least
[3:24:32] <+Jekado> really lvl 6 gank seems really late?
[3:24:33] <+Quack_of_Dawn> You buy at base unless you're Ornn
[3:24:34] <ape_hawk> MF putting in work
[3:24:34] <%arcaderabbit48> Wait, the fuck si their Bot lane? Shaco and Senna?
[3:24:36] <NotLysander> Temmo was probably thinking he needed to heal and you were there just to cover the turret
[3:24:37] <+Grayhammatter> that fortune is doing work
[3:24:39] <sxynoodle> *cough cough*
[3:24:40] <+MadPretty> Bot getting fat
[3:24:40] <zayasu> @mmack093 fate > ow > league
[3:24:42] <Oxybe> RECKnekton is a beas
[3:24:43] <+Elite_Tube> Hello~!
[3:24:44] <%NSwarmlord> Bot is Feed
[3:24:51] <+Jekado> i don't think jungling is his thing
[3:24:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Miss Fortune dont care
[3:24:55] <%freezydude> @Jekado Some champions have good early ganks, like shaco. some champions have good level 6 ganks. vi can do both.
[3:25:01] <NotLysander> go bot pat
[3:25:02] <VritraReiRei> @galaxyswirl thats either worded wrong or bad advice so you should be careful about that
[3:25:04] <+Xalgar> NO PAT HELP THEM
[3:25:06] <%freezydude> The key thing is to get ganks that are worth your time @Jekado
[3:25:08] <zayasu> look at your bot NotLikeThis
[3:25:09] <+mesirel> can links be posted here or do they get auto killed?
[3:25:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zayasu FGO's a major reason for that, I mean..
[3:25:12] <kazadog> @AngriestPat your ult is amazing for opening up ganks
[3:25:13] <toyforus235> hit plants
[3:25:16] <%ledgefiendd> you can smite earlier than you think @AngriestPat great farm so far
[3:25:17] <%Mekhet09> Eve has really bad early games and can be counterjungled to fuck.
[3:25:20] <+napargonaga> If I'm getting annoying with the questions, just let me know.
[3:25:20] <Kravus> Free drag tho
[3:25:22] <+mmack093> Leash!
[3:25:23] <%galaxyswirl> @VritraReiRei how so?
[3:25:25] <+Jekado> yeah thats what i thought for the most part is ganking is situational
[3:25:27] <BlackermanZX> Free Drag
[3:25:27] <%Mekhet09> It's sad she needs a buff.
[3:25:27] <NotLysander> Is morgana justinian?
[3:25:28] <thewhiterice92> Upgrade your W
[3:25:29] <cassiecagedd> dragon with no smite very risko
[3:25:39] <vingadivo> nice
[3:25:40] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[3:25:41] <usurper_sos> good drag
[3:25:44] <mankeyfigh> Bot is killing it
[3:25:45] <FirearmsInstructor> Ocean Drake kill = ??
[3:25:48] <%Mekhet09> You need to know what lanes to gank.
[3:25:49] <Kravus> Kill that Senna
[3:25:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Playing jungling is very stress
[3:25:54] <%freezydude> @Jekado It depends on your champion, like someone like Current diana has no real gapcloser so unless they're over extended gankings really hard.
[3:25:55] <kazadog> @napargonaga no worries man this game can be pretty impenetrable if you dont ask questions
[3:25:57] <+Jekado> also some cordination too your ally needs to know you are going in
[3:25:58] <tegas_> Top lane is usually going to be a hard one, you could mess up mid and bot though.
[3:26:01] <+MoonlightP> forced flash
[3:26:02] <%daemonazaezal> making sure you keep up ion level and gold is most important
[3:26:04] <Renkage> Used up a flash. That's a win
[3:26:04] <+MadPretty> Good trade
[3:26:05] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat You got his flash, it's fine!
[3:26:06] <BlackermanZX> Still forced flash
[3:26:07] <+MadPretty> FLash for ult
[3:26:08] <%Mekhet09> You should have used Q.
[3:26:10] <%Ninestempest> flash 15:50
[3:26:10] <EndgameContent> Forcing Flash is good
[3:26:10] <Monicro> 2 summs!
[3:26:11] <shiny_prinny> you got his flash that's good
[3:26:12] <Kravus> And still died
[3:26:12] <+MoonlightP> five min cooldown vs 90 second one
[3:26:13] <vingadivo> worth you got flash and heal
[3:26:14] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat getting flash is so worth it.
[3:26:14] <%Mekhet09> Lol they got her.
[3:26:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat You got her Flash, so that's a plus for you
[3:26:15] <EndgameContent> It's as good as a kill
[3:26:15] <+MadPretty> nisu
[3:26:17] <%SilentEric> Nice job
[3:26:17] <EndgameContent> Ah
[3:26:20] <%mungdip> You’re bot is big
[3:26:21] <tegas_> You and morg can pound Ori.
[3:26:23] <+Quack_of_Dawn> flash, heal and got an assist
[3:26:23] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat after you ult go for the q
[3:26:24] <%SilentEric> Have you gotten dragon?
[3:26:25] <%daemonazaezal> ASSIST

[3:26:39] <%freezydude> SHES INVISIBLE PAT
[3:26:40] <NotLysander> shes invisible
[3:26:40] <%Mekhet09> You can kill her...
[3:26:42] <%freezydude> Probably.
[3:26:44] <%SilentEric> She is invisible
[3:26:44] <+stillsbury_doughboy> she has perma stealth
[3:26:45] <BlackermanZX> Invisible
[3:26:46] <+Jekado> what level is the eve at
[3:26:47] <vingadivo> INVISIBLE
[3:26:51] <+TestAnon> @AngriestPat hey Pat, are you having fun :)
[3:26:54] <%SilentEric> Her passive is she stealths

[3:27:00] <Kravus> Renek is coming
[3:27:02] <%ButterMyBrisket> apatBig bully time
[3:27:09] <+barristerofthebar> o u t
[3:27:10] <+Jekado> oh so now she has a passive stealth
[3:27:10] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> shes level 5 isnt she?
[3:27:11] <%ledgefiendd> gj bullying the jungler
[3:27:12] <%freezydude> Pat you c an smite WAY earlier than that.
[3:27:12] <@JustinianKnight> hahaha wooooops
[3:27:13] <xeros720> i came back for salt with my dinner
[3:27:14] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat She's scared of you
[3:27:16] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> no stealth yet
[3:27:16] <%Mekhet09> Eve can be bullied to fuck now.
[3:27:20] <%SilentEric> It is very important to know that Eve goes invisible if you aren't really close to her.
[3:27:22] <+Jekado> well your doing better then the eve it seems
[3:27:32] <%Shikari21> i just got here how has his other games beenm?
[3:27:34] <%Shikari21> been*
[3:27:34] <%Mekhet09> ANd if she doesn't get kill fast then she can't scale.
[3:27:35] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat evelyn is all burst damage so if she uses all her abilities shes an easy target if she is out of combat she loaks and heals up to 75% hp
[3:27:36] <+Jekado> should jungle more in their forest more then no?
[3:27:36] <vingadivo> eve is perma invisible pat
[3:27:37] <%SilentEric> Get Void herald. Its easier than baron
[3:27:39] <%freezydude> @Shikari21 3 losses 1 win
[3:27:40] <+MoonlightP> tbh this game could be going worse
[3:27:44] <%SilentEric> You can solo it
[3:27:49] <%Shikari21> @freezydude ty ty
[3:27:55] <@JustinianKnight> bot lane is stomping
[3:27:55] <Node_One> Pat. Please press F on the enemy jungler.
[3:27:56] <Kravus> jungling is good practice, really keeps you on your toes about the map and info overall
[3:28:00] <Node_One> Thank you.
[3:28:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude I think he's got 2 wins.
[3:28:02] <%Mekhet09> Not really eve is in a bad spot.
[3:28:10] <%ledgefiendd> hitting your q is the most important part of your initiation; informs you on whether to go in
[3:28:15] <%freezydude> @CommanderSqueaks he lost the vi game,e he lost the mordekaiser game, he won the soraka game, he lost the yorick game.
[3:28:18] <usurper_sos> go back
[3:28:19] <%Mekhet09> the meta doesn't really use assassins
[3:28:20] <+OmegaOcelotOk> pat do you watch any pro games to get a feel of what to do?
[3:28:21] <%SilentEric> You can get top side's objective. It's the big bug.
[3:28:22] <vingadivo> back
[3:28:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude Ah, okay.
[3:28:23] <NotLysander> jungle is really tough
[3:28:23] <+Grayhammatter> go back
[3:28:23] <%Typhaeon> Pat that dude is level 10
[3:28:24] <%ButterMyBrisket> gator is big fed
[3:28:25] <BlackermanZX> Back would be wise
[3:28:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Jungling is the most stress
[3:28:25] <Jarvanii> too much gold
[3:28:26] <+Jekado> thats jungling
[3:28:26] <%ledgefiendd> you are doing great
[3:28:28] <%SilentEric> Void herald for sure
[3:28:28] <Kravus> Don't go after Renek lol
[3:28:29] <%Shikari21> oh no
[3:28:29] <+MoonlightP> i'd go back
[3:28:29] <tegas_> Care for when he has red
[3:28:30] <theKingRamses> back, renekton is too strong
[3:28:30] <Jontman42> You're just gonna get doublekilled
[3:28:30] <+stillsbury_doughboy> double kill
[3:28:30] <+MoonlightP> spend gold
[3:28:31] <pitsuji> dont
[3:28:31] <+Grayhammatter> you have 1.5k gold
[3:28:33] <+Jekado> its like the hardest i feel
[3:28:34] <toyforus235> help top
[3:28:37] <ALazo> top is fed we might say
[3:28:37] <%QuadraticGravity> why q tho
[3:28:39] <+Jekado> wow he is fed
[3:28:43] <usurper_sos> That is Renek
[3:28:44] <BlackermanZX> Same
[3:28:46] <+stillsbury_doughboy> dont start with the ult
[3:28:46] <%SashaStarshine> RENEKTRON
[3:28:47] <@commanderclaw> tron?
[3:28:47] <%Ninestempest> renek is a bitch
[3:28:47] <%CaptainKarite> Renektron
[3:28:47] <$FrogROOT> MrDestructoid
[3:28:48] <%freezydude> Pat try and save your gap closers if you can get behind the opponent
[3:28:48] <+Deko_> renektron
[3:28:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> So this is why jungler is hard, gotta make a lotta decisions.
[3:28:49] <ape_hawk> RENEKTRON
[3:28:50] <Lithdoran> Teemo is also an idito
[3:28:50] <usurper_sos> TRON
[3:28:51] <%Shikari21> shoulda q first tbh but renek is annoying
[3:28:52] <+MoonlightP> man i wonder if this gets pat killed
[3:28:54] <%Mekhet09> Renekton...
[3:28:54] <+DankDreamTeam> Hes French
[3:28:54] <VritraReiRei> @galaxyswirl Vi has a really strong level 3 gank ability. it's just that you have to pick your lanes. Landing a Q mid lane means she's dead cause of Morg binding. Bot lane blew summoners at level 1 so ganking them asap works to. Teemo on the other hand lends nothing to a gank while Renekton has tons of ways to escape a gank.
[3:28:55] <Renkage> Don't worry. Fed MF
[3:28:55] <shiny_prinny> that's a champion you should ult last rather than first
[3:28:55] <%freezydude> @CommanderSqueaks absolutely.
[3:28:55] <%daemonazaezal> HES BEAF
[3:28:59] <BlackermanZX> Remember to hit the herald's back
[3:28:59] <%daemonazaezal> BEEF
[3:29:03] <+DankDreamTeam> Renekton is canonically French
[3:29:03] <xstormyone> hit it from the back
[3:29:04] <%SashaStarshine> PAT HIT THE BACK
[3:29:06] <Freddyf> tbh renektron is a gud metal-renekton name
[3:29:07] <+Xalgar> Pat is so lucky no one has that warded LUL
[3:29:08] <%freezydude> @CommanderSqueaks it's the most impactful early game role. it can change games.
[3:29:08] <Zelretch3000> @AngriestPat HIT THE EYE
[3:29:08] <$FrogROOT> beep boop i am renektron MrDestructoid
[3:29:10] <vingadivo> look at levels before ganking if the enemy is more than 1 level above your laner you definitely lose
[3:29:11] <Kuubyy> RENEKTRON
[3:29:12] <%SashaStarshine> HIT THE BACK PAT
[3:29:14] <Kravus> Hit the eye when it pops out
[3:29:15] <%Shikari21> hit the eye!
[3:29:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Isn't there actually a Renektron skin
[3:29:18] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Whenever you can manage, try to punch the Rift Herald from behind to smack the eye for big damage
[3:29:23] <ShineTheDiamond> Chat, just got here. How is Pat doing so far?
[3:29:27] <+GeneralHysterics> per usual, I assume the support is doing all the real work in bot. Good job justinian!
[3:29:28] <%QuadraticGravity> PAT
[3:29:28] <%freezydude> PICK IT UP
[3:29:28] <%mungdip> Nice
[3:29:30] <%freezydude> PAT
[3:29:30] <Kravus> pick it up!
[3:29:30] <%arcaderabbit48> @GarbageNirvana RenekToy, but same basic idea
[3:29:30] <+MoonlightP> oh my god
[3:29:30] <+TheWorstPersonAlive> aHNSAD
[3:29:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude What would you say is the easiest to start with.
[3:29:32] <%Shikari21> GET IT
[3:29:32] <+Jekado> lol
[3:29:33] <+jay521> OH NO NO NO
[3:29:33] <%Shikari21> OH NO

[3:29:43] <ShineTheDiamond> Nevermind then
[3:29:45] <+MoonlightP> big buy
[3:29:46] <%SoFarFetched> better get that clipped
[3:29:46] <Dovakhin573> glad to see Renekis still a pain to deal with
[3:29:46] <tegas_> That happens in pro games sometimes.
[3:29:46] <%mungdip> It’s better to press lanes that are winning
[3:29:46] <%Gogogolem> comedy of errors
[3:29:47] <BlackermanZX> DONT forget to use it
[3:29:49] <vingadivo> I've done that so many times
[3:29:51] <+sp_abadidea> MF is getting super fed
[3:29:51] <SoySocks> close one
[3:29:52] <+Grayhammatter> bot is fed
[3:29:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude I meant lane, character type (Tank, Carry, etc.)
[3:29:53] <+hartowallu> @AngriestPat have you heard anything about the new champ? His ult is a mother fuckin SUPLEX
[3:29:55] <%SashaStarshine> Nice one @JustinianKnight
[3:29:56] <%Shikari21> man this bot lane
[3:29:56] <OldManDeckardCain> PANTS WERE ALMOST SHAT
[3:29:57] <FirearmsInstructor> How does killing all the NPCs help complete the objective? Does it make him OP with EXP? Or $ to team?
[3:29:59] <+Jekado> seems like everyone is doing well tho
[3:30:01] <Kravus> Yeah, just smash bot lane with it
[3:30:04] <+Jekado> like his team
[3:30:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @freezydude Last time I played was ... 8 years ago>
[3:30:06] <Kravus> That bot is so fed
[3:30:06] <CirclesForever> wheres he gonna put the purple boi
[3:30:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> **?
[3:30:10] <Kravus> it's ridiculous
[3:30:17] <%Shikari21> @FirearmsInstructor it gives pat gold, xp so he can help the team
[3:30:19] <%freezydude> @CommanderSqueaks I mean probably simple champions so the melee ones.
[3:30:22] <+Xalgar> Just push this lane
[3:30:22] <%daemonazaezal> give morg blue
[3:30:24] <umm_idunno> @FirearmsInstructor exp and gold plus you get buffs
[3:30:25] <kazadog> @FirearmsInstructor some provide buffs to the killer or buffs to the team all give cash and xp
[3:30:26] <cassiecagedd> 4!
[3:30:26] <vingadivo> use it mid
[3:30:29] <%Mekhet09> Press 4
[3:30:29] <%mungdip> Your boy will carry you
[3:30:30] <CyprienCole> Remember only you can ff
[3:30:33] <%freezydude> @CommanderSqueaks if you play ranged champions you gotta know how to kite/orb walk to stay at range
[3:30:37] <$FrogROOT> press 10
[3:30:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor Certain NPCs provide buffs, either to the person that killed it or to the team as a whole. And some of those buffs are very important
[3:30:38] <%freezydude> so probably tanks.
[3:30:41] <usurper_sos> Nice
[3:30:49] <%BeardedLuchador> Drago next
[3:30:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor The giant crab thing he just summoned is one such buff
[3:30:55] <vingadivo> shelly :(
[3:30:55] <%Shikari21> him using q to wave clear is tilting me
[3:30:56] <jordanstayshome> that was perfect
[3:30:58] <kazadog> @FirearmsInstructor the big monsters in the pits generally give teamiwide benefits
[3:30:58] <NotLysander> it was ok
[3:30:59] <%freezydude> That was perfect
[3:30:59] <%galaxyswirl> yes it was
[3:30:59] <%Ninestempest> yes that was great
[3:31:00] <thorzimeron> perfect
[3:31:00] <theKingRamses> close enough
[3:31:00] <shiny_prinny> that was good
[3:31:00] <cassiecagedd> thats your game plan!
[3:31:00] <+Jekado> that was good
[3:31:00] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat You forced flash, now B
[3:31:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> yeyeye
[3:31:01] <tegas_> Yeah you did that right.
[3:31:01] <%Shikari21> not bad
[3:31:01] <BlackermanZX> Yeah worth it
[3:31:02] <usurper_sos> not bad
[3:31:03] <thorzimeron> molto bene
[3:31:03] <Kravus> That was fine
[3:31:04] <%SashaStarshine> That was as good as you could have done it
[3:31:04] <vingadivo> yeah
[3:31:05] <xstormyone> close enough
[3:31:05] <Renkage> You keep on forcing them to use flash
[3:31:06] <toyforus235> you crazy
[3:31:08] <%ButterMyBrisket> good
[3:31:08] <%mungdip> That was good
[3:31:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @Shikari21 @umm_idunno @kazadog @arcaderabbit48 Thanks. I'm complete noob. <3 Trying to understand.
[3:31:13] <+TestAnon> Pat's Learnding!
[3:31:13] <%freezydude> of shit shaco is in thsi game?
[3:31:15] <VritraReiRei> Ulted a little early to be honest but not bad
[3:31:17] <%freezydude> support shaco?
[3:31:17] <Kravus> That Ori is ballsy
[3:31:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you force them to Flash, that is a W
[3:31:20] <NotLysander> top needs some support tho
[3:31:20] <%daemonazaezal> yeah your doing great
[3:31:21] <%Mekhet09> You shouldn't really use R to engage if you don't have to.
[3:31:22] <CirclesForever> e stops people from doin stuff, it interupts things
[3:31:22] <Kravus> no pun intended
[3:31:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor No problem! This is a great place to ask questions
[3:31:26] <%daemonazaezal> good engae
[3:31:27] <pitsuji> teemo's still up there suffering
[3:31:28] <banditohum> meanwhile temmo is getting bullied top
[3:31:30] <NotLysander> good crit

[3:31:35] <+Xalgar> LUL
[3:31:36] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat any time you get someone to flash you automatically win that the next time you gank
[3:31:37] <%daemonazaezal> but teemo is not doing too hot with Renek
[3:31:38] <%BeardedLuchador> MF clapping cheeks
[3:31:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:31:42] <cassiecagedd> a good way to catch people off guard is to charge up the Q then flash during the charge to give your self bigger range
[3:31:42] <Setsuna_seiei> someone help teemo
[3:31:43] <CirclesForever> shaco is also an invisible bitch
[3:31:46] <+MoonlightP> shaco is obnoxious to chase
[3:31:47] <%Shikari21> Pat wave clearing with q is killin me to watch
[3:31:48] <%BeardedLuchador> clown alert
[3:31:48] <+Dr_Mooose> just got in, so is Pat jungler now?
[3:31:49] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat 5 minutes to LL

[3:31:55] <+Xalgar> Poor Teemo LUL
[3:31:59] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat Look at your top lane.
[3:32:00] <%BeardedLuchador> don't chase the goofy clown
[3:32:01] <%freezydude> @Dr_Mooose he plays everything.,
[3:32:05] <%daemonazaezal> shaco
[3:32:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Their team could be horribly annoying. ITs a good thing MF is here
[3:32:09] <%daemonazaezal> he has a shadow clone
[3:32:10] <Setsuna_seiei> @Xalgar must be crying
[3:32:12] <%mungdip> Peel for MF and you’re golden
[3:32:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Xalgar As someone who used to main Teemo, Teemo deserves to be bullied.
[3:32:13] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Help Teemo!
[3:32:15] <Setsuna_seiei> Kappa
[3:32:15] <+hartowallu> Hes in the bush

[3:32:46] <CirclesForever> @AngriestPat blue smite works on champions too
[3:32:46] <Gulpunpun> why was that the real one holy shit
[3:32:46] <%Shikari21> shaco pls
[3:32:47] <%arcaderabbit48> He used his clone during the team fight
[3:32:47] <%Mekhet09> 112 gold
[3:32:48] <shiny_prinny> thought that was a clone LUL
[3:32:48] <Renkage> He just used his clone
[3:32:49] <%BeardedLuchador> was shaco maybe just bad? Keepo
[3:32:49] <%mungdip> I thought that was clone
[3:32:49] <+MoonlightP> ????
[3:32:49] <Freddyf> no mana i guess????
[3:32:50] <+Xalgar> @freezydude He ulted earlier LUL
[3:32:51] <tegas_> Renekton might be in your jungle
[3:32:52] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> could've hit him with smite for the kill instead of using flash
[3:32:52] <vingadivo> what was shaco doing???
[3:32:53] <+Jekado> i odn't think that shaco is any good he doesn't seem to be doing the tricks
[3:32:54] <NotLysander> he was hoping you would think it was his clone
[3:32:54] <kazadog> remember pat your smite can slow enemy champs now
[3:32:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shaco got whacko
[3:33:03] <VritraReiRei> Smite would have saved him a Flash
[3:33:10] <Freddyf> everything gud so far huh
[3:33:14] <%Shikari21> @AngriestPat Remember to use smite when chasing like that cause it slows now
[3:33:18] <%freezydude> @AngriestPat you should probably upgrade phage into the other item this game
[3:33:21] <%mungdip> Peel MF
[3:33:22] <vingadivo> pat please remember to use smite on enemy champion it damages them
[3:33:22] <+Dickbuttsf> but flash saved him his smite
[3:33:22] <Kravus> That dmg

[3:57:38] <%AncelDeLambert> wait.... wrong guy
[3:57:39] <Tyrimat> YES
[3:57:40] <bear_breaker20> still tilted
[3:57:41] <Mister_McDerp> yep
[3:57:43] <%Ninestempest> You have to use Flash on narrow walls
[3:57:44] <NotLysander> it takes a lot to learn that flash wall trick
[3:57:44] <$Dakuu75> it goes to your cursor
[3:57:47] <Jathspuh> :)
[3:57:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Errors have been made
[3:57:48] <NotLysander> It used to be so much worse
[3:57:49] <simifu> most people still do it LUL
[3:57:50] <%Ninestempest> it's very hard to do it on far walls
[3:57:52] <+Jekado> thats flash alright
[3:57:56] <oniwahoo> Yeah, that feels like shit when you do that
[3:57:56] <%ledgefiendd> yeah, thats a pain that doesnt leave
[3:57:57] <%SilentEric> Fail flashes suck
[3:57:57] <vingadivo> it happens even to faker
[3:57:58] <Tyrimat> Its a learned thing
[3:57:59] <%AncelDeLambert> yup
[3:58:00] <%SashaStarshine> Basically crashed into it
[3:58:01] <%rj1771> Yeah, getting a flash-brick is the absolute worst xP
[3:58:08] <%ledgefiendd> but the dopamine for succeeding is commesurate
[3:58:11] <+Dickbuttsf> your flash has to reach at least halfway over the wall
[3:58:20] <Zelretch3000> @AngriestPat just practive wall flash in practice tool
[3:58:27] <+tuchpi> flash is a bad crutch for league :)
[3:58:30] <$MachoMadnesss94> !uptime

[3:58:47] <%thebeargoesHONK> Play Sona
[3:58:47] <vingadivo> do 4 camps if you can
[3:58:52] <%Shikari21> or do another camp
[3:58:57] <+Ursendorf> Is this the beginning or the end of the stream
[3:59:02] <+Jekado> @AngriestPat it might be better to flash when chased into a bush is to flash a different direction AS THEY enter the bush because they get confused, and chase the wrong way.
[3:59:05] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Are you gonna watch the FF14 Live Letter?
[3:59:07] <+Venaire> Try to Gank or if you are feeling good go invade their jungle
[3:59:11] <NotLysander> That's a look at the map point. you can go back or look for ganks
