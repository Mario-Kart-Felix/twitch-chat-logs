[0:38:11] <%InternetShis> Perf
[0:38:22] <RushUnplugged> @The_Angry_God_Hoogs but really, it's a very low-pressure mmo designed to drop it when you're out of content or just want to pause, it doesn't try to hook you in.
[0:38:23] <%mighty_max_t> mighty_max_t subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Happy Endwalker day, Pat. Not personally into the gameplay of 14 but have a desire to experience it's story one day. I hope you and everyone else have a blast with the expansion!

[0:55:54] <%THATGUY_789> 99 outa 100 streams No elmo problems, Pats biggest stream Elmo problems
[0:56:22] <%TheEvilOmega> They also get reborn and can retain their memories, yeah?
[0:56:39] <sirrice77> @TheEvilOmega This is why you need to trap them and then use a bunch of aether to blast their literal soul to pieces
[0:56:41] <+Krivvan> @TheEvilOmega no, not if you trap their aether first
[0:56:42] <+S10tho> the downside to having no tactical paige to fix elmo problems
[0:56:48] <%THATGUY_789> cats collectivly as a species have never been fed once
[0:57:03] <+Sadira_snack_attack> I audio distorted for anyone? Or is my twitch acting up?
[0:57:17] <%THATGUY_789> nup
[0:57:19] <%TheEvilOmega> Right, and did we trap Emet's aether? I don't recall use trapping it. Just ripping him to pieces with light.
[0:57:22] <+Transatlantic_Dylan> Fine on my end
[0:57:25] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Sounds good on my phone
[0:57:35] <+Tizona824> @theevilomega Their soul attempts to go to the rift between worlds to reform, trapping them in white auracyte and annihilating them sends them back to the lifestream
[0:57:35] <%volitzern> Trap and destroy the soul, or they can grab a new body basically.
[0:57:37] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Thanks guys
[0:57:51] <%THATGUY_789> hasnt stoped emet before
[0:58:00] <Guardiansaiyan> I hope Emet was reborn into a POTAT...and thats how he is narrating
[0:58:10] <%zarkazeon> huh now that I think about it. I wonder if Emmett ever actually met his end
[0:58:10] <sirrice77> @TheEvilOmega no it was trapped, thancred slashed apart the white auracite and the shards embedded into Emet holding him there to then be killed by you
[0:58:22] <sirrice77> Unless the shards didn't work right
[0:58:28] <@QueequegTheater> @THATGUY_789 Ironically, if Emet's alive somehow, he's probably also untempered from Zodiark now as well

[0:59:05] <+Krivvan> @TheEvilOmega we used white auracite on emet

[0:59:06] <%TheEvilOmega> Oh, right. Man, I forget large parts of the game. And I just beat ShB a few months ago.
[0:59:12] <%zarkazeon> he saved us from that one boss and I wonder 8f that was actually him showing up
[0:59:21] <%THATGUY_789> Zodiark Desychned Emmett
[0:59:24] <lazysaiyajin> just realised, Pat doesnt trip himself, he gets hit by the disco laser
[0:59:47] <+Krivvan> @zarkazeon implication is that it's more a memory from the crystal
[0:59:56] <%THATGUY_789> emett was Zodiarks belt

[1:00:47] <%QuasarKnightGaming> I hope pat doesnt get AFK'd at this rate... Queue times are shooting up according to my friend
[1:00:48] <@QueequegTheater> @zarkazeon @Krivvan I think Ishikawa said that it was him.

[1:04:48] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @keigatide if you skip the story you might as well not play FF14
[1:04:56] <SaltyAzteca> Yes! But why?
[1:04:58] <@QueequegTheater> @keigatide why would you skip the story
[1:05:02] <%THATGUY_789> story content much
[1:05:03] <eristhanewood> Its a final fantasy game first
[1:05:10] <eristhanewood> MMO second
[1:05:12] <keigatide> I mean, in a mmo the action.. is the action.
[1:05:15] <+SladeClegane> Yes, but don’t
[1:05:18] <+CaptainJax> papers please
[1:05:24] <+DeRedBaron> oh hey that actually was referenced outright
[1:05:28] <gespenst25> Yeah, because no one could get a fake tatoo. Lyse what are you doing here?
[1:05:29] <%NopeBadguy> you're missing the rpg
[1:05:32] <TheShockVox> DONT FUCKING SKIP JOJO PARTS
[1:05:34] <AoiRob> why not just play games with your eyes closed
[1:05:35] <%tanarath> If you wanted to skip every scene with action or quips in a Marvel movie, you could.
[1:05:37] <%JoshManVGH> @keigatide Yes it is, yes there is, and yes you can... you monster. Kidding
[1:05:37] <SaltyAzteca> Frowny potahta
[1:05:38] <Grunkle_Dan_> feels like bait
[1:05:39] <RushUnplugged> because 20 years of WoW trained people to not care about story since it's often garbage. This is NOT wow and the story is very much not garbage
[1:05:40] <filialpails> if I watch the movie faster than anyone else that means I win the movie
[1:05:41] <%NopeBadguy> this is an RPG for rpg fans
[1:05:42] <%Monkeyweed21> THANKS EUREKA

[1:19:03] <AoiRob> wtf characters follow you now??
[1:19:30] <+GigaSeifer> I especially love how the mechanic is mostly used to talk about somthing to look at, but the camera never lets you look at it while thye talk, lol
[1:19:30] <RushUnplugged> G tribe, Raha, Tia being a non-breeder (huehue)
[1:19:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> thankfully the spots are never far off the critical quest path, so its not as easy as i thought it would be to miss them
[1:19:35] <%THATGUY_789> i freaked at the palico for a second
[1:20:07] <%volitzern> I looked too lol
[1:20:13] <Edible_Enthusiasm> this door is not a door

[1:22:10] <GandhiTheTerrible> i think you advanced the quest
[1:22:11] <%Monkeyweed21> not this far
[1:22:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> i think they were messing with you
[1:22:13] <%shadowsofpain> you can only get them before talking to them at the eatery
[1:22:18] <%QuasarKnightGaming> You advanced the quest, its gone now @PatStaresAt
[1:22:22] <+Savarro> The fact that that's the only bug I've seen in 7 hours is a good sign
[1:22:25] <@StridentSong> The optional dialog bits disappear if you move forward with MSQ spots
[1:22:26] <karl_rex> Is it still a Ferry if it takes from Limsa to Sharlayan
[1:22:28] <artoflec> tihis is on PS5 too right?
[1:22:28] <+DoctorDerp388> MISSED FOREVER
[1:22:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I hope they sink into the ground too

[1:23:13] <%THATGUY_789> i hate attuning
[1:23:14] <SummonerMagno> i got Graha to glitch out here, he walked on air
[1:23:30] <bippityjones> Hey how many bunny boy maids have you seen so far?
[1:23:35] <+Lammchen> the one that offers big xp gains @oldneckbeard
[1:23:40] <+Havictos> C'mon you know there's some SCUM underneath the surface. No place is this nice without some hidden shit
[1:23:45] <+DoctorDerp388> army of bnuuy boy maid reapers
[1:23:53] <+tactician0> it's all soooo good
[1:23:53] <+Havictos> I don't trust these nerds
[1:24:13] <Necnill> Is that a bunny boy on the left 👀
[1:24:16] <%Monkeyweed21> that sounds like a dungeon
[1:24:20] <+Lammchen> never trust nerds man, look at pat LUL
[1:24:21] <%RealThiele> we're sooooo smrt
[1:24:34] <Srthunda> since when
[1:24:53] <+SladeClegane> TP is a tax write off LUL
[1:25:02] <+Lammchen> I really like this thing of npcs following you around
[1:25:02] <+BlubRobe> Wait, we're reinburse?
[1:25:02] <+Havictos> @bippityjones A lot
[1:25:17] <%froggycleric> Do paper work or throw money into the void, by money
[1:25:17] <%walternatorz> that's peak FF
[1:25:20] <%InternetShis> READ ALL DA BOOKS
[1:25:25] <%JoshManVGH> Get to hang out with the crew!
[1:25:33] <%InternetShis> It's pretty dang cool
[1:25:39] <%Axellogic> Its like a single player game
[1:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the Confluence sounds like a dungeon they add in 6.1
[1:25:58] <+SladeClegane> It makes a lot more sense then “I’ll see you there”
[1:26:02] <%Ebonyglow> I can't BELIEVE how rock solid the servers have been so far
[1:26:02] <+theinfamousq> god this music is so chill
[1:26:03] <TioXyco> BRUH'ra tia
[1:26:05] <GandhiTheTerrible> LUL
[1:26:05] <%UvBenServed> B'ruha

[1:26:11] <%Axellogic> If the players werent so congregated in one exact spot itd feel pretty lived in with people running around
[1:26:14] <%InternetShis> B'ruh
[1:26:16] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Near the dock
[1:26:21] <+Savarro> Limsa in shambles
[1:26:26] <%shadowsofpain> Docks
[1:26:27] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt check the weapons up to 88 on the MB
[1:26:32] <AllenDeadman> monk feels weird
[1:26:32] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> LUL
[1:26:32] <%QuasarKnightGaming> South side, near the docks
[1:26:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> mailbox is pretty far away
[1:26:38] <AllenDeadman> because I literally lost 2 OGCDs
[1:26:40] <%walternatorz> limsa mailbox is in a whole other zone
[1:26:51] <%walternatorz> or am I stupid?
[1:26:55] <+DoctorDerp388> limsa still the goat for world visit + MB
[1:27:02] <+Lammchen> I wonder if there's gonna be anything like you can grab npcs to form parties out in the overworld too? most of the time it would be unnecessary but I genuinely would enjoy fighting alongside G'raha out in some field again like it was an instance and have him make little quips and battle quotes
[1:27:06] <+YPFrost> :o
[1:27:16] <+DeRedBaron> oh my god
[1:27:17] <%walternatorz> we bloodborne
[1:27:17] <+MoonObscure> BRUH
[1:27:17] <+SoySocks> whirligig saw!
[1:27:17] <+Lammchen> that may be a lot to ask for depending on how it effects server load
[1:27:18] <SaltyAzteca> PIZZA CUTTER AXE
[1:27:19] <lazysaiyajin> is that a bloodborne
[1:27:19] <%TheEvilOmega> That weapon looks familiar.

[1:27:24] <%froggycleric> YEAH
[1:27:25] <Zeif00> YO
[1:27:26] <%QuasarKnightGaming> The blades ROTATE? Its a fucking Bloodborne Weapon
[1:27:27] <TioXyco> DRK gets a chainsaw sword
[1:27:31] <%walternatorz> that's reused
[1:27:38] <+DeRedBaron> damn and all i get are books
[1:27:45] <%volitzern> They sell up to 90 basic gear in a shop there for battle and hand/land, so it's all in one place to get basic gear lol
[1:27:45] <%RealThiele> the book looks great
[1:27:53] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[1:27:56] <+MoonObscure> gottem
[1:28:01] <+MetroidHunter26> all leveling gear are usually reused assets yeah?
[1:28:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat, they're selling skallic gear as just leveling gear now
[1:28:12] <%InternetShis> This is the market
[1:28:18] <%walternatorz> it's crystarium and eulmore combined
[1:28:25] <+DeRedBaron> yeah but do they glow with dragon wings like my anima weapon :3c
[1:28:35] <%volitzern> The starter scythe looks like Gehrman's xD
[1:28:44] <%furiousfurioso> AngelThump
[1:28:52] <%THATGUY_789> i went to hand a book to chloe but she said it was too old and smelly
[1:28:57] <%walternatorz> lazy!
[1:29:00] <+MoonObscure> XDD
[1:29:08] <+Shikari21> LUL
[1:29:08] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:29:13] <+DeRedBaron> i just want my collectors edition rewards, do i can get death scythe
[1:29:14] <+Shikari21> wait thats the skalic one

[1:29:25] <%QuasarKnightGaming> WAIT WHAT? I grinded so long for the Omega Armor and its THAT EASY TO GET?
[1:29:25] <+DoctorDerp388> EFFICIENCY
[1:29:28] <lazysaiyajin> uh oh
[1:29:30] <+BIumen> did you say omega
[1:29:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, i'm hoping the dungeon stuff is unique/new
[1:29:31] <karl_rex> nooooo
[1:29:32] <Necnill> LUL reduce reuse recycle
[1:29:35] <+BIumen> aw
[1:29:40] <%shadowsofpain> But they shade nice
[1:29:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> they always recycle old gear though
[1:29:48] <Zeif00> Oawr Nawr
[1:29:54] <%QuasarKnightGaming> OK. I heard Omega and Market Board and was about to shit bricks
[1:29:59] <GandhiTheTerrible> gonna guess this is because of covid?
[1:30:03] <%Monkeyweed21> so anything unique would have to be dungeon gear
[1:30:05] <RushUnplugged> old gear usually goes on vendor/crafted, and dungeon gets new
[1:30:07] <Jeexx> can't wait for people on twitter to be mad about reused assets or something lacSip
[1:30:17] <%TheEvilOmega> I'm kinda torn, you guys. I want to play the hell out of this (i'mma dip once Pat gets to where I was before lunch), but I also have other stuff I wanna play.
[1:30:43] <night__monkey> i am not expecting much from this MSQ due to Covid
[1:30:45] <deviljhojho_> where we walkin boys
[1:30:54] <deviljhojho_> a grotto if you will
[1:31:05] <%InternetShis> Super Greek
[1:31:10] <+Krivvan> @night__monkey production quality seems much higher it seems
[1:31:19] <%walternatorz> I haven't found a jumping puzzle yet
[1:31:26] <%InternetShis> This place loves their curves in its designs
[1:31:31] <+Havictos> @TheEvilOmega In Yoship's own words feel free to come back whenever you want if want to play other things go right ahead
[1:31:35] <%shadowsofpain> Maybe it's a Greek version of Greece, I've never been to either so who knows
[1:32:01] <%InternetShis> How do toilet flush
[1:32:10] <SaltyAzteca> But how does the piping work
[1:32:13] <Edible_Enthusiasm> please do
[1:32:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> aw, i missed this talk spot
[1:32:15] <+MoonObscure> i wish
[1:32:17] <+SladeClegane> Soda in shambles
[1:32:21] <+Havictos> Maybe one day
[1:32:21] <%InternetShis> no :)
[1:32:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> i dont know how i even missed that
[1:32:25] <%Ynkubus_> Mayhaps down the line
[1:32:27] <%TheEvilOmega> @SaltyAzteca The Romans had plumbing.
[1:32:30] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Okay but no expac for 6 years
[1:32:32] <%zyberion626> sacrifice another ultimate tier for it
[1:32:42] <%shadowsofpain> I mean Hingashi's nice too I guess
[1:32:55] <SaltyAzteca> @TheEvilOmega Do these guys have magick plumbing? Kappa
[1:32:55] <RushUnplugged> embiggen it all
[1:32:59] <%nanaki_ff14> You have say and yell shut off right?
[1:33:04] <%RealThiele> i hate it when im out and accidentally embiggen
[1:33:12] <%TheEvilOmega> One would assume they have magic plumbing.
[1:33:14] <%Puhff> LESGOOOOOOOO
[1:33:24] <%nanaki_ff14> Perfect
[1:33:38] <Treasure_Vault> They'd have to message paige to yell at pat
[1:33:39] <GandhiTheTerrible> that's literally a reference to Rome
[1:33:43] <+Tizona824> It's magic. I ain't gotta explain shit.
[1:33:45] <@QueequegTheater> I'm on busy and have my entire chat window hidden
[1:33:48] <GandhiTheTerrible> the Rostra is/was real
[1:33:51] <%InternetShis> I have Events, just so I can focus on the actual thing that matters
[1:33:55] <%shadowsofpain> Completely isolated from others, the way God intended
[1:33:58] <%Retinolgaming> But pat, we've been trying to reach you about your Chocobo insurance.
[1:34:03] <%nanaki_ff14> Just drank the fantashia. Au Ra since HW and now I be Bunny Boi!
[1:34:09] <tubit> so, i play for 4-5 hours and within seconds of saying something critical about one certain quest, i get disconnected. i'm not putting on my tinfoil hat here. just observing the amazing synchronicity lol
[1:34:14] <%Hobojo153> I can't believe how smooth the launch has been
[1:34:16] <+I_chose_Rapture> I_chose_Rapture subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[1:34:20] <%walternatorz> Kugane is best!
[1:34:23] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a pretty sight
[1:34:24] <%Hobojo153> I just got on with a 45 person que
[1:34:25] <%walternatorz> Just do the jumping puzzle
[1:34:29] <karl_rex> Last gen limitations be gone
[1:34:34] <@QueequegTheater> It's like Dark Souls
[1:34:37] <%Monkeyweed21> kugane has the tower
[1:34:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> Yoshi P confirmed there is a jumping puzzle somewhere
[1:34:53] <%Puhff> same here
[1:34:55] <%Mr_Pylon> So seems like that extra couple of weeks paid off for the this launch?
[1:34:56] <%shadowsofpain> Yoshida said not to the level of Hingashi
[1:34:58] <Guardiansaiyan> YUP
[1:35:02] <%walternatorz> It's all management
[1:35:04] <+MoonObscure> yup
[1:35:06] <Guardiansaiyan> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[1:35:11] <lostvayne91> the launch has been so great that its not talked about lol
[1:35:16] <%RealThiele> last night was sketch but it only took about 2 hours to get fixed
[1:35:20] <SaltyAzteca> Thats impressive
[1:35:20] <GandhiTheTerrible> it's been pretty smooth so far
[1:35:21] <chai_wolf> I love this music but it's making me sleepy
[1:35:21] <$realm_forge> LOOKIN AT YOU BUNGIE
[1:35:24] <%walternatorz> they don't launch a bad product, simple as that
[1:35:27] <%nanaki_ff14> I never crashed during ShB launch
[1:35:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Guild Wars 2 has only gone down 3 times total but this is close
[1:35:37] <+SladeClegane> You slept through the rough patch
[1:35:40] <%InternetShis> Meanwhile Bungie is nominated for community support SOMEHOW
[1:35:40] <%Hobojo153> Like I was lagging once I got in for a while but that was it
[1:35:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Yoshi-P made the right call with the delay.
[1:35:48] <2Sam4Hall> Somehow I ended up bypassing the queue. It was weird
[1:35:48] <%AnIrishPapaya> Yeah, New World was a hot 500+ in queue for every server a while ago before ya know, it went from 900k players to 160k
[1:35:54] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? What are we doing so far? And why are cat people following Patron?
[1:35:54] <%Hobojo153> * Once I got in at 4am that is
[1:35:55] <+Krivvan> yeah it was a bit fucky for like an hour after the start but it has been stable since then
[1:35:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> this has been the smoothest MMO launch i have ever seen, i didnt have a single issue
[1:35:56] <%RocketBarrel> Took me 2 hours to log in
[1:35:59] <+Savarro> I got in 5 minutes after launch, dc'd an hour in, was back in within minutes, played for 6 hours with no issues
[1:36:00] <+GallowsDrop> I'm super surprised that with my ass internet, I managed to play for 4 hours with absolutely no problems with connection
[1:36:02] <%volitzern> It only took me 30 mins to get in with a full ass server this morning lol
[1:36:03] <deviljhojho_> real talk most people i've seen playing have been running instead of walking so it counts as false advertising
[1:36:07] <tubit> i'm number 5000 in queue now. great!
[1:36:14] <TioXyco> I took at least 50 minutes to log in, but then again I had a 3k queue LUL
[1:36:17] <%walternatorz> it looks like a guitar when it's on the back
[1:36:20] <Edible_Enthusiasm> number go up
[1:36:31] <%SatChamp> the queue for goblin was like 50 people long so i either got super lucky or goblin is not too active
[1:36:40] <Jontman42> 2002 has booted me out of a 4k queue three times now after getting down to 1000-2000 range :)
[1:36:45] <tubit> i'm on light-zodiark. EU
[1:36:52] <+EySoyCoco> 2500 on spriggan EU too
[1:36:52] <@QueequegTheater> Of course
[1:36:52] <+SladeClegane> Good ol’ Nyunkrepf Nyunkrepfsyn
[1:36:53] <$realm_forge> This music reminds me of small Mediterranean restaurants for some reason
[1:36:56] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Nyunkrepf is responsible for that weird boat out in the Peaks
[1:36:59] <@QueequegTheater> EU getting crushed
[1:37:01] <%RocketBarrel> Oof EU
[1:37:03] <+ccwettr123> Been playing since 4am, played till noon, got lunch, came back 2 minutes ago, already back in
[1:37:03] <+NYCrownlessKing> i got on at 8am est and the queue was only 18 ppl @PatStaresAt

[2:35:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Canada has tons of oil too
[2:35:23] <ricotez> is that Wario
[2:35:24] <lazysaiyajin> cuz Hydroquebec
[2:35:24] <MaraSmug> Who needs water when we have oil
[2:35:27] <+polothegreatest> As california dries slowly
[2:35:29] <%KineticZen> Counterpoint: Alberta
[2:35:33] <%zyberion626> what?
[2:35:34] <marcdyllan> I say let Finland have the north pole
[2:35:34] <%Alazull> That's insane
[2:35:37] <%luftraumm1> also lots of lithium
[2:35:37] <deviljhojho_> just drink ocean water 4Head LOOOOL
[2:35:39] <Tracazoid> When valuable resources start running out, all will come running to invade Canada
[2:35:39] <axelkaspar> We Stand on Guard is about that. spoiler: the US just invades with mechs
[2:35:41] <%strakillias> Aren't also like shit loads of diamonds, oil, and uranium in Canada?
[2:35:41] <tubit> Canada second largest country in the world - fact
[2:35:42] <+sjcodan> YOU CAN FILTER IT
[2:35:43] <TimetodiveLTX> water wars lmao
[2:35:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Can’t forget the maple syrup
[2:35:46] <%slimmixrp> Also hydro powered electricity trickles down from Canada
[2:35:49] <%Retinolgaming> Arctic shipping routes, Lumber, fresh water, etc.
[2:35:50] <%solracc25> oil
[2:35:51] <+sjcodan> ITS CALLED THE WATER CYCLE YOU DORK
[2:35:52] <TimetodiveLTX> we are fucked
[2:35:52] <%walternatorz> Ha! I live in Michigan
[2:35:53] <+GallowsDrop> I WILL
[2:35:57] <Redmannasah> Southern states gotta interject here
[2:35:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Canada is super important to the US economy
[2:35:57] <%InternetShis> Also Sharlayan says they're never at war by pulling their borders back when Garlemald grows bigger
[2:35:58] <%solracc25> also oil
[2:35:59] <+D00msDayDan> @sjcodan filtering seawater is still super costly
[2:36:00] <%Alazull> Well on that lovely note, have fun Pat. Gotta go to work and try to cook instead of playing game
[2:36:02] <%Mr_Pylon> LOL try filtering enough ocean water to grow all those crops
[2:36:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @sjcodan California says hi
[2:36:08] <SaltyAzteca> waterworld tho LUL
[2:36:09] <%solracc25> Wrong
[2:36:14] <MikeyxStyles> @sjcodan is becoming one guy
[2:36:17] <+ThirdPersonPhil> wasn't California already running out of potable water?
[2:36:18] <%luftraumm1> waterworld is a great horrible movie
[2:36:25] <%luftraumm1> its not good
[2:36:25] <%zyberion626> I think Pat's talking about fresh water
[2:36:25] <%solracc25> rainwater CAN be bad
[2:36:28] <Sunstalker> fuck yeah waterworld
[2:36:29] <+sjcodan> @Monkeyweed21 I reply to California with a hearty 'Fuck off'
[2:36:30] <+Sadira_snack_attack> You mean you have the US's reserve of potable water?
[2:36:35] <SaltyAzteca> I think Paige is the first person ive heard to praise waterworld
[2:36:36] <%Wulfphelz> Waterworks is a great movie
[2:36:37] <+D00msDayDan> sjcodan is ddetermined to be one guy
[2:36:39] <%InternetShis> Fountainworld
[2:36:41] <%Ynkubus_> Waterwolrd is great if its not the one they showed in the cinemas
[2:36:43] <%Monkeyweed21> The issue isnt drinking or bathing water, its agriculture
[2:36:45] <%Reilata> I remember enjoying it a million a years ago when I watched it, but I haven't watched it since then.
[2:36:48] <+fetrigon> ye gazebo watersports :)
[2:36:48] <+polothegreatest> dinosaurs need to ceased to exist to farm water
[2:36:52] <tubit> I'm actually kinda impressed Califorina's water has lasted this long
[2:36:54] <%THATGUY_789> desalination is a thing but very expensive
[2:37:05] <%walternatorz> dad's a dick
[2:37:06] <axelkaspar> fun fact: Waterworld made a profit because lots of overseas audiences didn't care about the awful script and characters. they just wanted apectacle
[2:37:11] <+JustToWatch> @sjcodan there are many places that consume more water that comes from the water cycle, meaning they have to rely on limited water resources, like rivers or underground water
[2:37:12] <+sjcodan> If you could run out of drinking water, why haven't we yet? We've been drinking water literally forever
[2:37:16] <Edible_Enthusiasm> yikes

[2:37:44] <%emperordread> Furr0ther
[2:37:53] <+D00msDayDan> @sjcodan aquifers are running dry, rivers are dying up, we're determined to get there
[2:37:57] <+polothegreatest> texans have oil to survive and drink like no one
[2:38:04] <StarMechV> Forget
[2:38:24] <+sjcodan> It still rains here, I can't run out of water
[2:38:24] <StarMechV> forget it alpha. cool dragoon is your new dad
[2:38:28] <+FutaSnek> @sjcodan The earth getting hotter and it all evaporating in the future is why, we havent had climate change up to this point

[3:30:46] <+Castle_Kundarak> I think you need to do a fate in the zone
[3:30:56] <%VictorVonLouche> maybe cause some of the zone is locked?

[3:50:53] <$EsotericOdyssey> a STAR SHIP
[3:50:55] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt
[3:51:13] <$EsotericOdyssey> that's just my guess, anyway
[3:51:20] <%Monkeyweed21> the big question is why they think the Keening wont reach inside here
[3:51:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I just need 164 people to go to sleep.... then I’m back in

[3:53:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[3:53:03] <G_476> Corvos has been in the Encyclopedia Eorzea etc. Dunno if it was in the game, though.
[3:53:07] <Edible_Enthusiasm> seems like they know about it
[3:53:17] <%Ebonyglow> ehh i personally think people freak out over spoilers way too much. (that being said i would never start spoiling people)
[3:53:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> the place Graha is from
[3:53:30] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> So like, they seem to be planning on moving sharlayan to the moon. But isn't Zodiark literally in the moon? So like, that isn't exactly the safest place to move.
[3:53:39] <G_476> Actually, I think they might've mentioned it once as a point of reference for where Bozja is?
[3:54:02] <%Retinolgaming> SourPls
[3:54:04] <Daskolin> LUL
[3:54:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels no, they're guessing they're wanting to move to the place in Ilsabard, but if Pat is correct, they're not planning on going anywhere

[4:21:39] <Edible_Enthusiasm> playing vicariously through pat c:

[4:21:45] <$realm_forge> I’m playing a heavily modded Skyrim but yeah
[4:21:46] <%Zundelle> I'm watching your stream while waiting on the first dungeon for the 4th time
[4:21:46] <%dwhanson> I’m at work T-T
[4:21:54] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> True
[4:21:55] <BreakfastSampler> summoning primals IS creation magic, just a 1/14th form
[4:21:55] <%PrimalDweeb> I'm just dozing while listening.
[4:21:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah its been lag-free the entire launch
[4:21:56] <%StephanieSadGirl> StephanieSadGirl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I gotta sub as a thanks for shaming me publically, thank you orb daddy <3  Also please kiss Gief's tummy for me.
[4:21:56] <%Ebonyglow> it has been amazing, rock solid servers
[4:22:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt anyone can use creation magic, it just ends up as summoning
[4:22:00] <%InternetShis> Fuckin crazy
[4:22:01] <%aBusyWizard> it's been incredibly stable all day
[4:22:01] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ques are gettign worse
[4:22:02] <%Eldalu> I'm playing through you
[4:22:02] <%Reilata> Just kind of chillin, not that talktive.
[4:22:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> I don't play FFXIV either, you're just background noise tbh
[4:22:02] <+ArticPath> knock on wood its been a good launch
[4:22:03] <%Ynkubus_> It's been pretty smooth for the most part
[4:22:04] <%luftraumm1> playing something else, can't afford the sub currently
[4:22:10] <Zourath> Actually I'm playing a completely different game that had an event at the same time
[4:22:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> i was up until 9AM from 3AM
[4:22:12] <+DrFacilier> the 2 week delay seemed to have helped
[4:22:12] <Jace_Keats> yeh you are fine while eu is crumbling down under its own weight
[4:22:13] <Solvari> EU servers are burning rn
[4:22:14] <@QueequegTheater> Same on Crystal
[4:22:14] <+johnny_scissors> Really though overall how freakin smooth has this launch been? I'm shocked
[4:22:27] <%Canorius> as they kept creating abominations from their fears in the face of death, which is something current peoples cant do
[4:22:28] <+RTBexe> blame russia
[4:22:29] <%Zundelle> yes
[4:22:31] <+Orcapugs> Me neither MMOs are not my cup of tea. But I can appreciate this game
[4:22:31] <%Wulfphelz> All that worrying for nothing LUL
[4:22:33] <%dsmastodon> I don't have it either, used to but had a few bad run ins during a dungeon that soured me on playing.
[4:22:33] <%VictorVonLouche> They went pretty bad for a bit
[4:22:34] <%JohnAtDawn> Light was, last i checked
[4:22:40] <G_476> Light seems to be filled to the brim
[4:22:41] <%Nordguy> It's been fine for me when I got in
[4:22:41] <Solvari> It was fine in the morning, now that people are coming home from work they are shitting themselves
[4:22:43] <%InternetShis> All three of them
[4:22:44] <%Ynkubus_> EU isnt that bad, I'm on chaos omega
[4:22:44] <Jace_Keats> light actually kicked everyone
[4:22:45] <vuetyris> might be bc afternoon there
[4:22:45] <+SaphronBlackbourne> When it dropped I couldn't get past the title screen a lot of the time
[4:22:46] <%Nordguy> in Chaos
[4:22:47] <%VictorVonLouche> Light crashed i think
[4:22:47] <%luftraumm1> not all mmo launches are this civil
[4:22:50] <%valriot> No they just stopped working
[4:22:50] <dan_g_v> can't wait to hear what Belular and Rurikan will have to say by the end of the day
[4:22:54] <%InternetShis> Light is shitting and pissing

[5:03:07] <+FutaSnek> YEA
[5:03:12] <%zyberion626> @azure_dunes Aether is where a lot of streamers play so it can get pretty full. primal is pretty chill
[5:03:12] <+Tizona824> Apologize later
[5:03:13] <+Krivvan> @azure_dunes Primal, Aether, and Crystal are all NA; Crystal has some more RP, Aether and Primal more raiding
[5:03:16] <%VictorVonLouche> Age applies a charisma debuff to anyone around them too
[5:03:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Beat his ass got it

[5:03:20] <Solvari> Mind Games
[5:03:20] <%MrP33Ps> @azure_dunes it's the most popular NA DC. I'd go with Primal if you don't already have friends on Aether
[5:03:22] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I had it worse, my dad is a lawyer, his job is literally dismantling arguments on the spot
[5:03:23] <%PrimalDweeb> The vibes from Pats character in the background are just perfect.
[5:03:30] <%THATGUY_789> he became a conspiracy theorist

[5:05:49] <haisho> Pat without a hat is like...super heresy?
[5:05:50] <%InternetShis> Can confirm Gunbreaker has negative clipping
[5:05:51] <%THATGUY_789> im still annoyed i cant change hrothgar hair styles ho hum

[5:05:57] <%InternetShis> The gunblades still hover
[5:05:58] <lazysaiyajin> i thought this was a 7day stream
[5:06:00] <%Shadowthedigger> Clip is not great
[5:06:04] <Archmortal> Personally I felt like actual shit after hour 8, and I went for 10-ish
[5:06:05] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm gonna head to bed, but I hope you enjoy your time with Endwalker, Pat. I'll see you all later.
[5:06:06] <SinisterBroccoli> no issues at all
[5:06:09] <SinisterBroccoli> I love my bun

[5:06:19] <%valriot> None so far, similar to hyur, midlander female
[5:06:23] <+Shikari21> im playing nin bun and i havent had any clipping issues
[5:06:26] <%InternetShis> Me, and GNB coats and weapons still look good

[5:06:45] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I’m sticking to catdude
[5:06:46] <SharKinStereo> using the Uraeus coat, only long hair clips collar as usual
[5:06:48] <SinisterBroccoli> Reaper scythes also have no problems
[5:07:02] <+GigaSeifer> could always fantasia a retainer, no?
[5:07:33] <SharKinStereo> @GigaSeifer he's concerned about running/moving animations
[5:07:49] <haisho> able to....?
[5:08:00] <$realm_forge> Loving the casual bongos
[5:08:06] <SinisterBroccoli> The sword is scaled down pretty heavily on buns
[5:08:10] <SinisterBroccoli> for drk
[5:08:19] <+GigaSeifer> ah, yeah I suppose retainer would only give you the various netural stances
[5:08:28] <SinisterBroccoli> I think it helps with clipping
[5:08:35] <%THATGUY_789> bunny bottom
[5:09:01] <%Cozy90> The music around here sounds like a carnival
[5:09:01] <%valriot> Ive had no clip tbh besides longer hair, thats it
[5:09:28] <BreakfastSampler> o h n o
[5:09:41] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Zoinks scoob
[5:09:42] <SinisterBroccoli> My hair was clipping thru dragoon nier coat
[5:09:59] <SinisterBroccoli> but that's not hard to do for any race

[5:14:45] <+polothegreatest> she talks crazy talk psaLiz
[5:14:50] <scrumbotime> I am, STRUGGLING to world transfer
[5:14:53] <haisho> or be forced to relog due to technical issues like I did
[5:14:56] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I can't get in still
[5:15:04] <scrumbotime> 30+ minute queues for world travelling
[5:15:06] <%VictorVonLouche> The queues save your place at least
[5:15:07] <%MrP33Ps> queues have been very good for me
[5:15:11] <%THATGUY_789> absolute stellar  work
[5:15:12] <ValkahRoctsteel> Here I am suffering on  Cerberus
[5:15:15] <%Maids4lyfe> the number of people I see get disconnected on twitter has been so few
[5:15:16] <+johnny_scissors> Long queues would always have happened. People are playing just fine and that's nuts
[5:15:29] <@Spydurman> better to have long queues and it work then everyone is in and the world is chugging
[5:15:29] <+SaphronBlackbourne> "Occasionally" getting DC'd out of queues is very common for me
[5:15:30] <%furiousfurioso> I've been playing for like 12 hours straight not a single issue
[5:15:31] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> the only thing I love more than sightseeing logs are yule logs
[5:15:41] <%MrP33Ps> i expected forced DCs, but nothing
[5:15:52] <%Birdigalore> Hit the showers!
[5:15:52] <%THATGUY_789> im digging this music

[5:16:22] <vuetyris> better get goin fast
[5:16:23] <+GigaSeifer> you'll knock that out easy
[5:16:26] <%MrP33Ps> you can do it
[5:16:26] <%BlackStarAura> Lol
[5:16:27] <%VictorVonLouche> Might take a bit.
[5:16:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> it shouldnt be, i was able to do it in 5 hours
[5:16:32] <Halfsock> i'd love to see the first dungeon
[5:16:37] <%Eaglestrike117> Pat thats gonna be hard it took me 7 hours to get to the first dungeon doing ONLY MSQ
[5:16:39] <@QueequegTheater> You can do it
[5:17:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Eaglestrike117 odd, i did it in 5
[5:17:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> though i am a fast reader
[5:17:08] <xxshadowxx416> @patstaresat right know in et is 5 276
[5:17:08] <haisho> just 700 more people to go through
[5:17:16] <BreakfastSampler> gsync and XIV don't play well together
[5:17:23] <xxshadowxx416> queue
[5:17:42] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> EU
[5:17:43] <+RTBexe> it make sense tho tbh
[5:17:45] <haisho> what's et
[5:17:51] <haisho> oh EU
[5:17:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh he's talking about his server queue
[5:17:57] <%THATGUY_789> eu server wait
[5:17:58] <Solvari> it was 10k before
[5:18:03] <%VictorVonLouche> 10000 took an hour
[5:18:03] <%THATGUY_789> i guess
[5:18:04] <Solvari> it takes over 1 hour
[5:18:05] <@QueequegTheater> EU not et
[5:18:09] <%Birdigalore> 1k was around 15 mins this morning
[5:18:11] <gespenst25> took me about an hour and a half two hours?
[5:18:14] <%Ynkubus_> 1.30hrs?
[5:18:17] <Daxalog> A year
[5:18:18] <haisho> I had to wait a while for that 3k queue I had to sit through earlier
[5:18:19] <BreakfastSampler> it'll probably take me about 40min to get through a 2k queue
[5:18:21] <+GigaSeifer> if it's still the 75ppl/min rate from this morning, 1 hour 10 minutes
[5:18:29] <ValkahRoctsteel> Too long.
[5:18:30] <+BrightOctarine> took me 1.5 hours for 3k
[5:18:43] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> wrong
[5:18:46] <Archmortal> it depends, sometimes the queue punts a couple hundred people at a time, sometimes it's single digits
[5:18:53] <%THATGUY_789> i cant wait for the australia data centre, no queues
[5:19:02] <+FutaSnek> damn this slaps
[5:19:03] <%MrP33Ps> 3k took me 20 minutes lol
[5:19:23] <+FutaSnek> Fuck I jsut got back and thought that was my PC

[6:28:16] <%Reilata> I'm too used to 1Bar Sorc in ESO, the pile of buttons seems overwhelming to me after being gone from WoW for years now.
[6:28:16] <Treasure_Vault> One of the good ones
[6:28:41] <dan_g_v> @AllenDeadman she was raised to fear them. Indoctrinated by her own family
[6:28:42] <AllenDeadman> I like her top, I want that for my monk

[6:29:49] <Solvari> you can tell by their voice
[6:29:53] <AllenDeadman> the ones where she is from will literally murder you
[6:29:54] <WillofGame> It's like Gary from Disco Elysium.
[6:29:55] <AllenDeadman> so
[6:30:02] <%YakumoYomi> "Quaking with racist elephant fear" needs to be on a t-shirt
[6:30:03] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[6:30:10] <Solvari> yeah in middle school

[6:30:13] <TheHeroAppears> time to dial up plague for confirmation
[6:30:18] <@QueequegTheater> It's racism from a lack of context, not out of malice or even really ignorance
[6:30:19] <AllenDeadman> it's not unreasonable fear... but...
[6:30:22] <%yendoria> Elephant totally do get huge titties

[6:38:40] <TheHeroAppears> why do the people elephants fight the animal elephants
[6:38:40] <+NopeBadguy> I thought you didn't like warrior? just didn't like any other tank this time around?

[6:38:51] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[6:38:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> well designed quest

[6:39:12] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[6:39:14] <+polothegreatest> those elephants arent related, dont worry about it
[6:39:16] <ExHero627> Question chat, I wanna watch but I don’t want to get spoiled if he’s past me. Is this before or after the 1st dungeon?

[6:40:36] <AllenDeadman> I left so many undone
[6:41:21] <AllenDeadman> is this whole questline just gonna be shock therapy for her?
[6:41:34] <Ghufufin> @shutup_meg might be more of a gorilla and human thing i think
[6:41:38] <G_476> same as in ShB innit
[6:41:48] <ape_hawk> did pat beat endwalker yet?
[6:41:49] <AllenDeadman> isn't it always like that for the first 2 zones?
[6:42:01] <%walternatorz> kholusia was split too
[6:42:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> and Kholusia
[6:42:26] <G_476> western coerthas is kinda-sorta split? the level 57 bit doesn't matter, though
[6:42:31] <%tusk102> number 3,788 in queue rn. pain
[6:42:38] <%InternetShis> Yeah but Stormblood had wack pacing
[6:42:41] <AllenDeadman> @ape_hawk no
[6:42:49] <%walternatorz> I imagine their design decision to split the zones mirrors the starting zones this time around too
[6:43:18] <%tusk102> so weird seeing pat as a war after watching his shb streams
[6:43:20] <+NopeBadguy> guys I'm sad, the new keyboard I bought for this on black Friday may have gotten lost in shipping
[6:43:23] <+NopeBadguy> NotLikeThis
[6:43:46] <%walternatorz> @tusk102 or a highlander?

[6:47:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Doubt it the level pacing is pretty good.
[6:47:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> they mentioned they wanted to make sure that EXP wasnt a problem in one of the liveletters
[6:47:53] <@QueequegTheater> I got like a full level running it with Trusts

[7:00:14] <%RealThiele> no eletitties
[7:00:28] <%tusk102> @karl_rex drg wol doesnt have a dragon blood spear/wasnt infected by nidhogg like estinien so they likely dont care
[7:00:33] <Butch_DeLoria> I'm glad we finally get to see Sharlayan, but Thavnair is stealing the fucking show
[7:00:42] <dan_g_v> elephant people making out gotta be interesting to see
[7:00:43] <ComeEase> Elephussy

[7:02:29] <+bravebravesrobin> sitting down for the first time in six hours on my break at work; what's been happening?
[7:02:34] <egoat> patron looks dumb in that hat legit

[7:03:17] <oda_flobunaga> Wow, this new Skyrim mod really changes the game!
[7:03:24] <HeroToxiko> a bunnyboy denied his kangle hat
[7:03:27] <egoat> my silly masquerade mask still works at least
[7:03:32] <%InternetShis> No clipping so far besides the accursed universal long hair clipping
[7:03:33] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> it clips maddddd baddd
[7:03:42] <+Havictos> Can't even get to the data center
[7:04:04] <SaltyAzteca> DansGame
[7:04:12] <%InternetShis> Popped collars are a bitch
[7:04:18] <+RTBexe> sometimes i wonder if pat plays the same game as i do lmao, never had that issue
[7:05:08] <%thebeargoesHONK> Am i super sad, my data center is so slammed it wont even let me into the waiting queue
[7:05:28] <%RealThiele> so after drops of connection from 2002 error it seems like your queue spot is kept if you can get back in within a minute
[7:05:34] <SinisterBroccoli> How do you get your aether compass if you've accidentally gotten rid of it?
[7:05:45] <%InternetShis> At least they don't have cottonball tails to poke through your back on every single set of gear
[7:05:48] <NBD_Rab> I switched my viera from female to male and have had less weapon clipping issues thanks to the terrible slouch
[7:05:56] <egoat> you got slooshed
[7:06:01] <%RealThiele> @SinisterBroccoli should be in collections now
[7:06:34] <SinisterBroccoli> wasn't it always?
[7:06:38] <+Havictos> When are Lion Women coming again? next patch or something?
[7:06:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt apparently the male viera is having less body clipping bc their slouch makes the weapon not angle into their back
[7:06:41] <GrandmasterGrimalkyne> Hey Pat, heads up, east coast is experiencing super bad log in errors, straight up says character data can't be loaded, and people are getting disconnected. I hope your experience stays super smooth
[7:06:45] <SinisterBroccoli> @SinisterBroccoli ty

[7:11:03] <karl_rex> Tower first phase is to make primals. Maybe the second is to see if the horrors made in the Final Days could be remade?

[7:56:02] <+RaveBV> :)
[7:56:13] <AllenDeadman> ah

[7:57:10] <+cokefiend> LUL
[7:57:11] <%Nekros4442> Emet ur mask sucks
[7:57:12] <AllenDeadman> oh okay
[7:57:13] <SaltyAzteca> Its always clones NotLikeThis
[7:57:16] <smward87> of course they are. just like the Garlean empire, their entire existence was orchestrated by the Ascians @Edible_Enthusiasm  (not a spoiler for EW, this was revealed back in SB or ShB)
[7:57:18] <AllenDeadman> yeah I should have just waited
[7:57:20] <+fishmonger555> ALL THIS LORE AAAA
[7:57:21] <AllenDeadman> huh
[7:57:22] <karl_rex> Cool ass mask
[7:57:25] <%asgard147> no wonder he's so fucking nuts
[7:57:26] <+polothegreatest> oops all clones
[7:57:29] <+RaveBV> inb4 this is a clone too Kappa
[7:57:40] <%Birdigalore> OK Kefka!
[7:57:58] <%NopeBadguy> So rather than fighting the last straggler of the Ascians, it's the last son of the Allagan Empire
[7:57:59] <%silentblast93> FUCKING CLONES WILL THEIR BULLSHIT EVER STOP?
[7:58:09] <+Tizona824> Just like that Fandaniel is great
[7:58:23] <@QueequegTheater> wtf I love Fandaniel now
[7:58:38] <%asgard147> He BUILD the Allagan empire to it's height and he watched it burn to nothing
[7:58:40] <LilacsandFreedom> like coils...
[7:58:55] <%NopeBadguy> Th...THEY ARE
[7:58:57] <AllenDeadman> so wait...
[7:58:58] <gespenst25> well yeah
[7:59:00] <LilacsandFreedom> I had a good feeling about that the SECOND I saw 'em
[7:59:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Yep
[7:59:01] <Edible_Enthusiasm> OH you're right
[7:59:04] <%NopeBadguy> I DON'T KNOW HOW I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
[7:59:05] <G_476> ...did Amon design the coils?
[7:59:08] <nip_nips> this is why the writer said coils was relevant
[7:59:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So the pods in the Matrix
[7:59:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I remember the dragons were caged up just like this
[7:59:12] <+Tizona824> He unironically built the binding coils
[7:59:17] <+Kyma1020> FUCK YOU'RE RIGHT
[7:59:19] <AllenDeadman> so the ascians basically found him... and... shoved all the other fragments of Fandaniel into him when he was Amon?
[7:59:24] <CruxAustralis> run away!!!
[7:59:26] <SaltyAzteca> Well shit
[7:59:27] <LilacsandFreedom> some kind of Big Summon in the works...
[7:59:28] <G_476> the warring triad jails worked on the same tech, too
[7:59:35] <gespenst25> he made spaceships too?!
[7:59:37] <+GallowsDrop> oh yeah they're literally just like the hulks in the Could holy fuck
[7:59:38] <%NopeBadguy> @AllenDeadman Basically, but he denied it as his primary identity
[7:59:42] <%JoshManVGH> I'm unclear on how Ascians are recruited. Was Amon a fraction of the original Fandanial, or do all ascian recruits merg souls with some part of the original 13?
[7:59:59] <AllenDeadman> @NopeBadguy so no shit Fandaniel has split personalities then
[8:00:03] <SaltyAzteca> SUMMON THE WARRIORS
[8:00:05] <CruxAustralis> man teleports are expensive now
[8:00:13] <CruxAustralis> from Thavnair to Sharlayan it's like 1400
[8:00:14] <+Tizona824> @joshmanvgh only Elidibus, Lahabrea, and Emet are unsundered
[8:00:16] <G_476> they just find a reincarnation and give them a memory stone, I think
[8:00:31] <G_476> so even if you kill one, there's thirteen backups

[8:00:42] <CruxAustralis> sat rap
[8:00:47] <+Tizona824> @joshmanvgh The rest of the Ascians are partial reincarnations that cannot be fully restored until the rejoining
[8:00:56] <%NopeBadguy> Sadge
[8:00:58] <%Nordguy> @cruxaustralis get your FC a TP cost buff
[8:01:24] <SaltyAzteca> Are they gonna name it after her
[8:02:10] <WillofGame> 3D printers are gonna go crazy with making replicas of those scales.
[8:02:20] <CruxAustralis> @Nordguy but heat of battle and MGP :(
[8:02:22] <karl_rex> Of course it was Amon who forbade further research of the cure for tempering Owen worked on
[8:02:23] <%NopeBadguy> how are you liking new inner release?
[8:02:36] <%JoshManVGH> Right but does that mean the lahabreha that was in Thancred is a different lahabreha than the other ones we fight? Like different sundered fragments that somehow unlock the memories of their unsundered selves?
[8:02:41] <CruxAustralis> uuugh fate farming
[8:02:46] <CruxAustralis> I remember that from ShB
[8:02:55] <jorniev> Amon was the weird clown scientist?
[8:03:00] <Edible_Enthusiasm> personal regen?
[8:03:00] <+bluestbee> @JoshManVGH Lahabrea was unsundered, they were the same guy
[8:03:03] <+nebula_lp> 14 has such nice use of leitmotifs im a sucker for that shit
[8:03:03] <CruxAustralis> 60 fates to complete brownRIP

[8:03:27] <%Axellogic> im awake again hows the story been? I left off at arriving t Sharylyan
[8:03:28] <%KnightOfTrousers> As someone who knows nothing about this game, even I could tell that's a big pop-off
[8:03:37] <CruxAustralis> @Nordguy the ones that want the fancy mounts and wings
[8:03:42] <%NopeBadguy> No Aether Compass on your hotbar?
[8:03:43] <Treasure_Vault> What did the coils do?
[8:03:45] <CruxAustralis> speaking of that I should go buy wings now I have enough I think
[8:03:52] <Edible_Enthusiasm> or do the opposite of that
[8:03:53] <roobanguy> aether compass dead

[8:11:40] <SaltyAzteca> He's the baby!
[8:11:41] <%asgard147> Baby of the bunch
[8:11:42] <+miguelrod777> oh the baby brother
[8:11:47] <%NopeBadguy> The thousands year old baby
[8:11:48] <Ubu2933> his face seems more fucked up than nidhog or hreasvelgr is it just me?
[8:11:49] <Treasure_Vault> nicol bolas?
[8:11:50] <Sol_Install> congrats baby bro
[8:11:51] <%Nekros4442> EYY THE BABY
[8:11:53] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Oh, is this the dragon Estinien is riding in the trailer?
[8:11:53] <Sol_Install> you out live them
[8:12:00] <%Aeoneth> i like how he uses  english
[8:12:06] <karl_rex> Only Midgardsormr spoke common. Why can Vrrtra too?
[8:12:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ohhh i got slimed by my dog
[8:12:18] <%Maids4lyfe> @Ubu2933 haven't you seen alien bahamut? his face is nothing but tentacles and horns
[8:12:22] <StarMechV> Matanga
[8:12:26] <%walternatorz> the exact opposite
[8:12:29] <%NopeBadguy> Well, it's like dangerously close
[8:12:35] <%Aeoneth> @karl_rex this is why
[8:12:37] <%Maids4lyfe> man fuck Ishgard
[8:12:42] <+Kango234> @aeoneth Oh wow I didn't even catch that.
[8:12:46] <%PatNTheHat> @karl_rex Probably learned it from being around all these people for so long
[8:12:48] <%Cactuskris> funny that you can live with them if you don´t kill them
[8:12:48] <lukaborne> @karl_rex he's been governing these people for centuries makes sense he can speak it
[8:12:55] <StarMechV> WOW IT SURE MAKES ISHGARD LOOK EVEN MORE STUPID
[8:12:58] <%asgard147> Ishguard fucked ALOT of things up
[8:13:01] <%NopeBadguy> FUCKIN HYURS

[8:13:18] <%PatNTheHat> Ask him why they didn't eat the eye
[8:13:19] <%NopeBadguy> a thousand year religious war does that
[8:13:25] <%walternatorz> but dragon eyes look really tasty
[8:13:28] <SaltyAzteca> piano's goin NUTS
[8:13:28] <%Cactuskris> they didn´t even have to do steps of faith that´s not fair
[8:13:41] <%InternetShis> Just don't fuck dragons
[8:13:44] <lukaborne> the only dragon of the brood to actually get along with humanoids
[8:13:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And Vrtra remains relatively hands off, letting people work themselves out, but only helping as necessary
[8:13:56] <StarMechV> Don't worry Vitry, we know that for SURE
[8:14:00] <%Maids4lyfe> I just noticed he has a scaled beard
[8:14:00] <jorniev> ALSO lots of half dragon people walking around.... kinky
[8:14:07] <%NopeBadguy> They are like one loose tongue away from total war
[8:14:16] <+FancyFishies> Has pat done the other half of the quests?
[8:14:18] <%JoshManVGH> I want Ahewanns jacket

[8:14:55] <Sol_Install> Where's Edward and Al
[8:14:57] <%NopeBadguy> Shouldn't you have felt this too as a potential Azure Dragoon?
[8:15:00] <%MisterRockett> YOURE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE SEXBOTS AT CRAFTER LEVEL 90
[8:15:04] <%NopeBadguy> Oh right
[8:15:05] <%Reilata> Why he was like 'nah don't worry about those scales'.
[8:15:05] <lukaborne> @patnthehatt true enough, not a whole nation tho
[8:15:05] <SeaReally> so the dragon can talk and see out of the kid?
[8:15:06] <jorniev> HE WAS SUS
[8:15:11] <%NopeBadguy> Estinien is part Nidhogg
[8:15:15] <%NopeBadguy> I forgot
[8:15:16] <dan_g_v> Eistinien!!!
[8:15:24] <Zombrocom> The Kid IS the dragon
[8:15:28] <%shurtal> AAAAND now i can't get back in the queue
[8:15:29] <%Cactuskris> you should feel it cause his dad was kinds in you
[8:15:32] <+Tizona824> "It's complicated"
[8:15:38] <%NopeBadguy> He had a reason to be an asshole
[8:15:40] <%NopeBadguy> But he was still an asshole
[8:15:46] <Sunstalker> his bro was a punk ass, the raditz of teh family
[8:15:47] <SeaReally> he was kind of a prick
[8:15:53] <SaltyAzteca> @shurtal At least you saw the skipped cutscene! MVGame
[8:15:54] <jorniev> WAY TO GET AN EXTENDED FAMILY
[8:16:01] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Midgardsmr, where you at
[8:16:14] <stevenellis386> man I love final fantasy
[8:16:18] <%walternatorz> I was afraid Thavnaria wouldn't have any cool lore and it has the best now
[8:16:19] <lukaborne> he sleepin
[8:16:27] <%MrP33Ps> it speaks volumes that he's not talking in dragon tongue
[8:16:29] <Srthunda> I want to look at the trailer again to see if he is missing an eye in it
[8:16:32] <+acridpaladin> its ok just use potatos. you can fit like 3 in at the price of 1
[8:16:35] <%shurtal> @SaltyAzteca i watched it in the unending journey after i turned in the quest, i was just panicking like crazy in the  moment
[8:16:50] <SeaReally> @mrp33ps i didn't even realize til you poi Ted it out
[8:16:52] <+miguelrod777> this is a full tank of bros
[8:16:52] <%Cactuskris> Thavnaria had cool India + dragons
[8:17:11] <StarMechV> yeee we have kicked ass
[8:17:31] <SeaReally> just the tip
[8:17:33] <%Maids4lyfe> dragons are friends
[8:17:41] <TheHotStuven> Sounds like dailies to me :)
[8:17:46] <%PatNTheHat> @Maids4lyfe Not food
[8:17:50] <%NopeBadguy> Not one
[8:17:52] <%NopeBadguy> HUNDREDS
[8:17:56] <%Dakuu75> wait so, from heaven's ward  Hraesvelgr and Nidhog were brothers, their sister was killed a long time ago by Ishgard and now there's a third brother, Vtra?
[8:17:58] <%Puhff> FOR REAL
[8:17:59] <AllenDeadman> give ONE to each Xaela
[8:18:00] <jorniev> it's nice when a fantasy country its nice and ask for help
[8:18:06] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> But not Lyse
[8:18:07] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Endwalker Benchmark was pretty rad
[8:18:11] <haisho> even Lyse?
[8:18:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> Give two to Fordola
[8:18:19] <%InternetShis> Give one to Sadu and just Sadu
[8:18:21] <G_476> the first brood is like seven dragons in total IIRC?
[8:18:21] <%shurtal> man, Vrtra is gonna go bald, giving out all his scales
[8:18:23] <%NopeBadguy> C'mon
[8:18:24] <%PatNTheHat> @Dakuu75 I think it said at one point Midi had 7 kids?
[8:18:26] <%NopeBadguy> Lyse isn't that bad
[8:18:29] <%Birdigalore> Give a fake one to Fordola, as a joke
[8:18:30] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Give one to Sadu!!
[8:18:33] <jorniev> GIVE IT to the detective guy
[8:18:34] <%Cactuskris> Lyse is ok
[8:18:35] <@QueequegTheater> Let Lyse get bimbofied, it's fine
[8:18:40] <+LikeARyder> Vrtra being a tax evader Kappa
[8:18:47] <%shurtal> FUCKING GODDAMNIT i'm at 4500 now
[8:18:50] <StarMechV> Is just me or is Vitra's voice giving me massive Malcolm McDowell vibes?
[8:18:52] <SaltyAzteca> yeyeyeyeye
[8:18:52] <SeaReally> why is he peacing
[8:18:55] <karl_rex> Wait is Fandaniel going to use one of the scales to confront Zodiark
[8:18:55] <+Kyma1020> Growth
[8:18:55] <+GallowsDrop> So like, your Character is probably gonna give Scales to all your job trainers, right?
[8:18:58] <%Cactuskris> @jorniev dosen´t need a mandervile man can´t be tempered
[8:19:05] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[8:19:05] <%walternatorz> he's so frickin' cool
[8:19:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I keep getting errors ;-;
[8:19:15] <AllenDeadman> the younger alien dragon
[8:19:15] <majindusto> Estinien is SO COOL
[8:19:18] <%NopeBadguy> Unlike all of the Ishgardian dragons, Vritra has lived with people for its entire life
[8:19:22] <haisho> the chillest of dragons
[8:19:25] <+Tizona824> I feel like he's the first rational wyrm since midgardsomr
[8:19:26] <%NopeBadguy> Well almost
[8:19:31] <jorniev> this is the beginning of a cool broship
[8:19:33] <+Local16> he's come a long way from being an asshole skeleton dragon
[8:19:35] <%Maids4lyfe> @StarMechV it's that gravely touch to it
[8:19:37] <haisho> didn't even threaten to set anything on fire
[8:19:43] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, Vtra seems like a bro
[8:19:45] <Zombrocom> I like bro dragon
[8:19:45] <%Screwdatguy> Same Wizard. Doesnt this game know I need to start Stormblood!?
[8:19:46] <%shurtal> i was at 924 and now after 5 minutes of login errors, i'm at 4378, great
[8:19:48] <SeaReally> when's a dungeon
[8:19:49] <%NopeBadguy> No Aether Compass on your hot bar?
[8:19:54] <%asgard147> welp, I'm bowing out of the stream now, cya all later
[8:20:10] <%zyberion626> @shurtal I know this pain brother
[8:20:11] <lukaborne> Vrtra is the most reasonable of the bunch
[8:20:20] <%Puhff> Pat y u got Infuriate on your hotbar twice???
[8:20:21] <haisho> those are some lengthy ass quests huh?
[8:20:26] <+Aokaay> i really like this song in this area
[8:20:27] <%Dakuu75> isn't Sharlya the place with all the goblins?
[8:20:37] <%Logoth_> This song sounds familiar
[8:20:44] <%NopeBadguy> @Dakuu75 That's Idyllshire in the Dravanian Hinterlinds
[8:20:48] <lukaborne> that's Idyllshire
[8:20:51] <majindusto> FFV song?
[8:21:03] <%NopeBadguy> @Dakuu75 It was a Sharlayan colony, but was abandoned when the Empire got CLOSE to Eorzea and was repurposed by goblins
[8:21:03] <%Dakuu75> oh, right-right
[8:21:04] <%shurtal> @PatStaresAt now you see why i was upset at skipping that cutscene? I spawned outside radz at han, not know ing why i couldn't get back in, with the quest icon saying i needed to go back to Sharlayan.  THANK GOT for the Unending Journey in your room
[8:21:16] <Thenuclearwalrus> PepePls
[8:21:35] <Sol_Install> coxJam coxJam
[8:21:36] <TheHotStuven> Is she supposed to be a play on FF5 kryile?

[8:22:03] <%Puhff> ratJAM
[8:22:29] <Saltmeisterr> im sry
[8:22:32] <%zyberion626> FFXIV is a love letter to the entire series, if you think something is a reference it almost assuredly is
[8:22:36] <Saltmeisterr> lunar ifrit?
[8:22:39] <%NopeBadguy> They would just summon ANOTHER primal
[8:22:42] <jorniev> so now the party can help you more directly
[8:22:59] <%Dakuu75> (Lord-allmighty... it's always primals.) lol
[8:23:02] <jorniev> I think pat nailed it
[8:23:06] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @TheHotStuven yes, her/the ff5 character's Japanese name "Kururu" even naturally matches the Lalafell naming scheme
[8:23:12] <+acridpaladin> yea but it would be funny
[8:23:14] <%Delenay> yup
[8:23:14] <SaltyAzteca> Naaaah itll be fiiiine
[8:23:21] <%NopeBadguy> We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
[8:23:21] <dan_g_v> not if they double jump right before hitting the ground
[8:23:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Maybe who knows they can land on each other its fine
[8:23:37] <Thenuclearwalrus> Nah see they're big fat elephants they got cushioning
[8:23:40] <+miguelrod777> it'll fall apart slowly maybe, hopefully
[8:23:49] <%notsoy> what if it's the eldin ring thing and you still die even if you double-jump like that
[8:23:59] <%zyberion626> no no nooooo not another 2002
[8:24:04] <jorniev> love you graha

[8:50:59] <%NopeBadguy> Like everyone shits on DRK, but it got a lot of actual new buttons whereas a lot of the other tanks just got upgrades
[8:51:03] <Bert_Karlsson> The upgrade to raw intuition on 82 is dope tho, basically just use on cooldown

[8:54:34] <Zombrocom> This place looks like the DMC5 qliphot levels
[8:54:49] <+Ellila> Reminds me of my colonoscopy
[8:54:51] <tanithmagnus> Yonic hallways, my favorite
[8:54:57] <%NopeBadguy> This is the tower that Kain and Golbez hold Rosa hostage in
[8:54:58] <+Birdigalore> Zot is FF4, but the meaty interior is similar to Exdeath's castle in 5
[8:55:02] <%NopeBadguy> You fight the Magus sisters in it
[8:55:07] <+acridpaladin> cheose
[8:55:09] <%Ynkubus_> A clungeon

[8:56:41] <SinisterBroccoli> the gays always change
[8:56:48] <%NopeBadguy> Also, Stri, how's Sage?
[8:56:51] <CruxAustralis> Reaper is very simple
[8:56:57] <%PatNTheHat> But how's the new summoner tho
[8:57:03] <%NopeBadguy> OH
[8:57:06] <%valriot> Its alot like old DRK LUL
[8:57:14] <SeaReally> sage looks SO COOL
[8:57:15] <+Kango234> I'm in!
[8:57:20] <Blank9> sage is amazing, it feels like much better scholar
[8:57:28] <CruxAustralis> 123 until 50 gauge, Bloodstalk, Gibbet/Gallows, 123 until 50 gauge, Bloodstalk, Gallows/Gibbet
[8:57:43] <SeaReally> it looks like a lot to learn but it looks so fun
[8:57:48] <%NopeBadguy> I've also noticed it does a lot more damage, but has no party ultility like Chain Strat, Vel
[8:57:49] <Blank9> it has so much regen too
[8:57:50] <haisho> I was tempted to start Reaper, but I decided nah clear on my DRG main before I level alt classes
[8:57:51] <ExHero627> Sage takes practice but it’s really fun
[8:57:53] <%zyberion626> oh God 2002'd I'M SORRY
[8:58:05] <+bluestbee> The pants again
[8:58:08] <CruxAustralis> Bonewicca
[8:58:11] <%PatNTheHat> Stri you have scholar but have you tried the summoner?
[8:58:30] <+Ellila> I can confirm that SAM is still very ungabunga.

[9:18:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> the other alternative is a bit gruesome
[9:18:37] <%InternetShis> One of those has to be a man's balls
[9:18:39] <+miguelrod777> steel ball run corpse time
[9:18:45] <+Tizona824> Maybe using the limb as some sort of summoning anchor for the whole tower?
[9:18:58] <%InternetShis> Oh man I got a theory
[9:18:59] <Profmcstevie> Elmo? What is he doing construction work?
[9:19:02] <%ElkRiverDog> Another dingleberry?
[9:19:05] <+Makouzer> did pat touch Gundam yet?
[9:19:29] <cartakus> did pat talk about part 6?
[9:19:31] <%InternetShis> Shoving the aether into the limbs to create a stable body for Zodiark?
[9:19:42] <%InternetShis> This feels like big summoning
[9:20:01] <Ghufufin> this has some real Chaika vibes
[9:20:15] <Profmcstevie> pp closet for pp
[9:20:17] <SinisterBroccoli> does anyone know, does the Amaro now require sage and reaper or ?
[9:20:22] <jorniev> is he making a body for the emperor dude?
[9:20:31] <%Mr_Pylon> Aww look at him grumble

[9:20:46] <%DashXero> Gief got huge-ish.
[9:21:07] <%InternetShis> It sounds like it's pumping the land's aether into a body for a Frankenstein's Warrior shit
[9:21:17] <AllenDeadman> please be alive...
[9:21:19] <%InternetShis> If it's just one limb for a tower
[9:21:23] <Profmcstevie> There will be time to sit with the two new jobs in Endwalkers entirety
[9:21:30] <%PatNTheHat> Just give everyone who goes into the towers a pair of moon shoes

[9:24:46] <+natjen8> 2002 erroring my way back in
[9:24:48] <%ClericOfSparda> I went to a restaurant before you did the raid and had my roommate make sure I wouldn't get kicked
[9:24:50] <+Shoosler> UGH I logged out just to make a bunny boy and see their options.. then queue was over 3k to get back on, and now it keeps giving me lobby error
[9:24:52] <%HotSauceFiend> that chocobo looked slow, but I can't tell if it is or not
[9:24:54] <CurrySauseBandit> So is this procrastination day?
[9:24:57] <%PatNTheHat> Planning to wake up early AF Sunday so I can spend my b-day no-lifing it
[9:25:00] <%InternetShis> The Cloud bike has speed boost by default
[9:25:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @HotSauceFiend ff7 paid mount is faster
[9:25:07] <%Samuy_JP> Hub time!!
[9:25:07] <Tracazoid> I'm playing FFV while waiting through the queue, hoping it doesn't boot me again

[9:25:14] <%washicka> I've been kicked at 2k twice eddaCry
[9:25:24] <ToneBacas> when was the last time you stood up moved around?
[9:25:26] <%PatNTheHat> @HotSauceFiend No way
[9:25:43] <%HotSauceFiend> wait does this game have ff7 style chocobo racing? that would be real dumb and I'd love it
[9:25:52] <Profmcstevie> Pats got two animals to take care of, he's not on his butt all stream
[9:25:59] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat music so far? I absolutely love the naproom music in Sharlyan
[9:26:04] <%PatNTheHat> @HotSauceFiend Then you'd love this game
[9:26:11] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Pat going strong heck yeah!
[9:26:28] <%psidefx> FIXED MARKET ONLY
[9:27:07] <+Kyma1020> That's how he gets money Pat
[9:27:31] <+fetrigon> I know I've been memeing about hydalyn being the endwalker, but is the endwalker actually the player?
[9:27:35] <+vaderxyz1970> No stop only play
[9:27:37] <Srthunda> right before garlemald?
[9:27:39] <%ElkRiverDog> Whenever you pass out
[9:27:44] <DruidHaruka233> Wow an in universe explanantion for treasure coffer dungeons. Neat
[9:27:49] <Profmcstevie> When the body no longer moves as the mind wishes....THEN stream ends
[9:27:50] <%InternetShis> Keep playing forever
[9:27:54] <%PatNTheHat> Just don't stop. Attach a Zangief toy to your controller so you don't get logged out
[9:27:55] <+fetrigon> no stops on this ride pat PunOko
[9:28:01] <%InternetShis> Stream will never stop

[9:28:13] <+Wolfstriker121> HOLY HELL PAT lol
[9:28:14] <%PatNTheHat> LUL
[9:28:15] <%HotSauceFiend> I look at Pat's giant character and am reminded about the main character in Skyrim is not supposed to be something like a Khajit, but whatever i guess, dovakhin kittyman
[9:28:19] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Nicew
[9:28:20] <+Jack8274> My game is crashing on launch trying to connect to the lobby server. It's bad
[9:28:28] <%UvBenServed> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[9:28:32] <%InternetShis> lmao
[9:28:42] <%DashXero> Glad to hear that Pat's Goblin Mastery is going well.
[9:28:43] <xxshadowxx416> ever ever bad
[9:29:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> @HotSauceFiend canon is for losers, the fanfic train is much more fun lmao
[9:29:24] <%Reilata> It's fine to be chill.
[9:29:30] <Profmcstevie> It's soothing pleasantries
[9:29:37] <+fetrigon> it's all very pretty :)
[9:29:39] <%InternetShis> We're all playing together
[9:29:44] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat did tanks get any new buttons?

[9:30:22] <SaltyAzteca> Casual Patron
[9:30:38] <%HotSauceFiend> my only mmo experience was runescape, and after that I'm scared to go back into mmo's financially and time wise. So getting to watch this is really something cool
[9:30:50] <+clientdevil> Safe to say ur liking this game m8
[9:31:00] <+clientdevil> More than smt v maybe
[9:31:00] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[9:31:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> my favorite room so far that i've seen in-game
[9:31:05] <+Havictos> 2.5k
[9:31:11] <+tempestzephyr> it looks like a casino
[9:31:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> the alchemy stuff is rad as hell
[9:31:14] <Profmcstevie> Well financially speaking this games got the full base game and first expansion for free if you're interested
[9:31:18] <haisho> they do the BIG alchemy
[9:31:24] <%kid_flashionable> This is a COOL ass place, wow
[9:31:24] <+clientdevil> Big ball time
[9:31:37] <+clientdevil> You got your haircut for this game release
[9:31:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> all this place does is make me want Chemist as a healer more lol
[9:31:47] <+Havictos> why?
[9:31:48] <%PatNTheHat> Yeah...
[9:31:50] <cartakus> Is it alchemy or just paint?
[9:31:54] <%PatNTheHat> Eulmore's not great
[9:31:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> maybe in the expansion after the nextt lol
[9:32:03] <%PatNTheHat> Why couldn't they Eul Less?
[9:32:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> Elmore was o-okay... Haha...
[9:32:04] <haisho> all it had was a strip club
[9:32:36] <+Shoosler> @PatNTheHat heh
[9:32:36] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Eulemore reminded me of that casino city from legend of legaia
[9:32:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> Estinien did mention how much of a maze it was lol
[9:32:38] <%Kiyosuki> it looked like a cool amano painting from afar at night though
[9:32:43] <%Kiyosuki> with the spotlights and stuff
[9:32:54] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat u think the new city will replace Limsa Lomimsa?
[9:33:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> he has more to say as you unlock the portions of the quest
[9:33:39] <Profmcstevie> a lot of space to populate some sort of....end of the world task force
[9:33:59] <jorniev> can't wait for the wild to span aiouaiouaiouaiou
[9:34:07] <+Havictos> Late Allagan gear it's so cool
[9:34:08] <%PatNTheHat> Just use 2B outfit?
[9:34:10] <jorniev> WOL
[9:34:12] <%dwhanson> 52 and got kicked T-T
[9:34:16] <+clientdevil> Did you finish smt v
[9:34:19] <+Shoosler> some sort of suicide squad
[9:34:19] <%amused_platypus> no patrons beauty must be preserved
[9:34:35] <+RealMichaelPhelps> this music is so nice
[9:34:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> the 2B outfit from the Nier Raids that is untradable? @PatNTheHat
[9:34:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> Yeah did you finish SMTV @PatStaresAt
[9:34:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> LUL
[9:34:59] <jorniev> I really appreciate the colors
[9:35:03] <%PatNTheHat> @SveriSageAdvice Yeah, that one
[9:35:04] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[9:35:08] <Durahand> god that aoe
[9:35:13] <%UvBenServed> I KNOW RIGHT
[9:35:13] <%HotSauceFiend> the synchronized running is soothing
[9:35:13] <SaltyAzteca> SHINY SHINY
[9:35:14] <Profmcstevie> SMT 5 is not even close and now Pats RPG of choice got new content
[9:35:16] <jorniev> this area is cool looking
[9:35:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> IT COVERS THE WHOLE arena for all boss fights
[9:35:18] <leto_ii_muadibadder> 😶
[9:35:22] <$StrawberryPantsu> 3530 QUE ON CRYSTAL LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[9:35:22] <+Havictos> Can't run away from this aoe
[9:35:24] <%DashXero> What the devil is that?!
[9:35:27] <+clientdevil> Apologies
[9:35:31] <+Edrem> the new earthly star is the same size as the entire arena of E12
[9:35:32] <+Makouzer> As soon as I saw Asmongold making a bunny  Griffith I am now seriously considering it too
[9:35:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> Heal bomb
[9:35:45] <+tetraes> @PatStaresAt  having fun so far?
[9:35:49] <cartakus> A what?
[9:35:50] <%DashXero> Ah.
[9:35:52] <%Reilata> The twanging sound will never not make me think of the Kingdom of Zeal.
[9:35:53] <AllenDeadman> Astro will be my healer of choice when I decide to learn healer
[9:35:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> it deals damage to all enemies and heals all allies when it explodes
[9:35:54] <+Havictos> @SveriSageAdvice Did they make it that big so that people who run away can't escape?
[9:35:55] <SaltyAzteca> JASON!
[9:36:00] <+BIumen> guess estinien cant jump
[9:36:06] <StarMechV> wha hapun
[9:36:07] <$StrawberryPantsu> @cartakus Healing bomb
[9:36:24] <%amused_platypus> you left estinien to get some milk at the grocery store, but you came back
[9:36:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Havictos that and bosses moved so often that sometimes it would go off before it could be useful
[9:36:29] <Ids560> any idea when the role quests happen?
[9:36:31] <Buttku> FF14 is about to be my first mmo ever. any recommendations on an easy to play job that any party would want?
[9:36:31] <cartakus> Just looks shiny
[9:36:32] <haisho> time to walk all over again
[9:36:43] <Ubu2933> uh oh got disconected getting super now the pain beguins
[9:36:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> @Buttku Paladin
[9:36:59] <Profmcstevie> I left Estinian in the bread aisle PanicVis
[9:37:01] <+Havictos> 2.3 k and crash
[9:37:07] <+Makouzer> @buttku play anything you want, for real
[9:37:09] <%PatNTheHat> @Buttku Tanks are in especially high demand right now, I personally highly enjoy Paladin
[9:37:11] <cartakus> I though Estinien was a person
[9:37:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Buttku SMN then RDM if you want DPS, Paladin for self sustainability as a tank, WHM for Healer
[9:37:25] <sirrice77> @Buttku a healer or tank will always be desired. Tank is probably easier
[9:37:40] <+Shoosler> tee hee xD
[9:37:45] <+Havictos> even his sword is blue
[9:37:45] <%PatNTheHat> Loves giving me BLUE BALLS
[9:38:08] <%HotSauceFiend> Ok, also a question. I don't have a friend group who plays this game. How.... difficult or awkward is it to join a random guild for raids and such?
[9:38:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Buttku right now Healer and DPS queues are going to be obscenely long, so try going as a tank
[9:38:14] <+Havictos> back to 4k god damnit
[9:38:23] <+Makouzer> is Pat using Gshade?
[9:38:30] <AllenDeadman> it looks so much better than the firts time they showed it
[9:38:31] <%DashXero> That's ultra-colorful.
[9:38:38] <jorniev> AGAIN FUCKING COLORS IN A VIDEO GAME
[9:38:41] <$StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt Now turn off Gshade LUL
[9:38:43] <%PatNTheHat> @HotSauceFiend Not very
[9:38:46] <haisho> know what airship landing means?
[9:38:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oh shit
[9:38:47] <Profmcstevie> This kinda colour palette is a delicate balance, they nailed it
[9:38:51] <jorniev> I'm loving it
[9:38:52] <+Havictos> @HotSauceFiend not difficult but it depends on how active a Free Company he wants to join
[9:38:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> @HotSauceFiend there are plenty of people who love getting new people, if you want there is an unofficial FC for the PSA discord
[9:39:04] <+Havictos> But would you if you could?
[9:39:11] <+RTBexe> why not both?
[9:39:12] <%amused_platypus> get me housing districts in there baby
[9:39:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Aeoneth is it normal that TANK queues are 20min for the first duty now?
[9:39:13] <+Makouzer> oh I didnt know it had problems with 4k
[9:39:16] <leto_ii_muadibadder> TPFufun catJAM
[9:39:20] <+wotko92> Art Direction must've had fun with the colors here.
[9:39:26] <+Dwarven_Gaming> GSHADE  does alot more than better textures, but up to you
[9:39:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Aeoneth sorrry wrong at
[9:39:43] <haisho> yeah it's normal if you aren't blazing through story
[9:39:59] <+Shoosler> @Buttku don't forget one character can be all the jobs and switch on the fly. I'd recommend just picking one based off their weapon at first and switch to something else if you don't like their abilities after a few levels
[9:40:01] <%DashXero> Those birds would probably be delicious.
[9:40:05] <+Havictos> @Makouzer 4k resolution still isn't optimized enough to be stable for everything
[9:40:09] <%Kiyosuki> Estinien seems to be quite the travelling foodie I noticed
[9:40:13] <+Makouzer> Gshade can relly make the game pretty without much effort
[9:40:16] <+tetraes> this looks alot better than the preview
[9:40:25] <%Kiyosuki> he always has a comment about some local dish
[9:40:42] <cartakus> Your companion seems chill
[9:41:34] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat how do you feel about the fact that pretty n
[9:42:01] <+Makouzer> much every othe cutscenes are voiceacted mb
[9:42:04] <%PatNTheHat> I love his accent
[9:42:14] <%Kay_Tana> Kay_Tana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years of this staring and I still cant tell what exactly at.
[9:43:01] <jorniev> THANK GRAHA TOO
[9:43:03] <StarMechV> Man, Vitra is so COOL
[9:43:06] <cartakus> Awwww
[9:43:09] <StarMechV> he is such a cool bro
[9:43:12] <%HotSauceFiend> did the dragon just offer his skin
[9:43:19] <jorniev> YEEEE
[9:43:22] <+Makouzer> Vrtra is cool as hell
[9:43:36] <cartakus> Arisen
[9:43:40] <$realm_forge> You saved the world. Here have my dandruff
[9:43:44] <%JoshManVGH> "Here have my magic dandruff!"
[9:43:47] <+Castle_Kundarak> Is Vrtra's voice actor the same as Gosetsu? I hear some similarities
[9:44:09] <%Reilata> jeeze
[9:44:12] <LoneFonte> oof
[9:44:22] <+Wolfstriker121> ok update logging back on siren and getting slammed with the 2002 error now
[9:44:22] <haisho> now look at how cool this dragon is
[9:44:24] <+RaveBV> just rub some dirt on it
[9:44:26] <jorniev> DAAMN
[9:44:36] <xxshadowxx416> do it like skin cells
[9:44:41] <$realm_forge> Enjoy my flaky secretions, hero
[9:44:58] <cartakus> That does not look like a annoyance
[9:45:10] <StarMechV> Vitra be like: "Eh whatever, those guys were assholes"
[9:45:11] <DruidHaruka233> Heavensward song
[9:45:22] <cartakus> Looks like a part of his belly was ripped out
[9:45:27] <+Makouzer> thank god Vrtra is not in dragon language btw would have been annoying to listen to longterm
[9:45:33] <%Nekros4442> Pragmatic Vrtra
[9:46:13] <CruxAustralis> mungus?
[9:46:16] <+Tizona824> He shouldn't?
[9:46:31] <arkv01> progs
[9:46:32] <CruxAustralis> where is middy btw?
[9:46:37] <+Tizona824> Dragons came after the sundering right?
[9:46:37] <CruxAustralis> would be a good time to speak up
[9:46:39] <CruxAustralis> just saying
[9:46:51] <+Tizona824> That's why no dragons on the first
[9:47:02] <%PatNTheHat> @CruxAustralis A thing happened with a raid series at one point
[9:47:15] <rosabellamelantha> he's asleep cus of raid things
[9:47:16] <CruxAustralis> oh right that
[9:47:17] <StarMechV> Fucking Crystal Momma stop being such a bitch and just fucking tell us
[9:47:17] <cartakus> Papa dragon
[9:47:26] <%Kiyosuki> maybe its kind of like how midgardsomr talked in dragon language to you at first but the more you came to an understanding, the more he spoke in your language
[9:47:37] <Treasure_Vault> Giving up is the real winning, sometimes.
[9:47:49] <%Kiyosuki> like Vrtra here has a connecton with the people so he speaks like this
[9:47:55] <leto_ii_muadibadder> yah lore dump
[9:47:59] <cartakus> Every day
[9:48:08] <+sirisvirus> sirisvirus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! hey 49 months right on Endwalker
[9:48:33] <Edible_Enthusiasm> isn't he still around
[9:48:35] <DruidHaruka233> So the dragons must have been in a bad way when they got here
[9:48:40] <Zourath> Sounds like all the other stars are FUCKED
[9:48:41] <StarMechV> She's still pretty sus tho
[9:49:32] <notandrew101> interesting dragon design
[9:49:37] <Cybersoul666> Helped my friends power level reaper so they can story as it. Jsut wanted to pop in to say Hi pat and when im done EndW ill be sure to come back for the vods
[9:49:49] <SinisterBroccoli> it's primordial?
[9:49:49] <+Catpurnicus> are  you saying you can't hear the planet crying out in pain?
[9:49:51] <+Havictos> where is midgardsormr anyway?
[9:49:52] <+Wolfstriker121> ok yeah dont log off people..3990 queue
[9:50:01] <Edible_Enthusiasm> That sounds an awful lot like the 'hear, feel , think' thats always everywhere too.
[9:50:08] <Tracazoid> He was talking of Tataru, Pat.
[9:50:09] <StarMechV> "Did you slay my dad, Warrior of Light? Did you slay him? DID YOU?"
[9:50:14] <Ids560> he's very sleepy
[9:50:29] <%PatNTheHat> Such a sleepy boy
[9:50:41] <+Makouzer> tomorrow is going to be hell when I log back in
[9:50:44] <%HotSauceFiend> would you want your main character to have an audible voice if the game offered it?
[9:50:56] <%JoshManVGH> I walk arouns with the Midgardsormer minion out at all times.
[9:51:02] <+BIumen> "you're too cool"
[9:51:06] <StarMechV> "I'm the protag. IT's what I do"
[9:51:09] <%Reilata> LUL
[9:51:10] <%JoshManVGH> And it's times like this I wish he spoke up
[9:51:18] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Patron the Strggler

[9:52:57] <StarMechV> We do kinda faint a lot
[9:52:59] <%JoshManVGH> "YOU MAY KEEP ONE CHILD!"
[9:53:00] <+Makouzer> would they be that obvious with the foreshadowing?
[9:53:00] <%kyh9> I say it's Alisaie that eats it
[9:53:04] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> And then the twins walk in!
[9:53:08] <+GallowsDrop> one of these kids is gonna die I swear
[9:53:09] <+Catpurnicus> did yoko taro get to write part of this
[9:53:09] <ohno778> queen shit
[9:53:19] <StarMechV> YoshiP I swear if you harm my children
[9:53:21] <karl_rex> Oh no not the two magical twins in the FF4 inspired expac
[9:53:22] <+JustToWatch> actually I think it's getting to obvious, it feels like a fake out is coming
[9:53:31] <@QueequegTheater> If this is your idea of idle chatter what the fuck does a serious conversation look like?
[9:53:34] <%furiousfurioso> Vrtra is rad
[9:53:49] <+shutup_meg> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[9:54:05] <%kyh9> DOES THAT GUY HAVE THE SAME AXE??!?
[9:54:05] <primarch_lupercal> lets not forget thancreds "death" guys
[9:54:07] <%amused_platypus> bread reward
[9:54:08] <%kyh9> WHO WORE IT EBTTER
[9:54:08] <+Makouzer> i dont think they are going to kill any one of them, they didnt til now, right?
[9:54:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh no, i just saw what two of the weapons for Sage is, it's Pat's worst nightmare
[9:54:15] <dan_g_v> so, both twins gonna die, one first and then the other? Or we lose them at the same time?
[9:54:16] <%kyh9> FIGHT FOR AXE SUPREMACY
[9:54:17] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Have you done the opening Sage quest yet?
[9:54:23] <Profmcstevie> Just uh...comparing penis sizes, as legends do with dragons
[9:54:29] <%JoshManVGH> Gitcha
[9:54:36] <%JoshManVGH> Gotcha rather
[9:54:37] <SinisterBroccoli> syringe blasters
[9:54:43] <lostvayne91> radz han looks amazing. so vibrant
[9:54:52] <%JoshManVGH> Gunrynges
[9:55:09] <%amused_platypus> thats not a noulith thats a pile of syringes
[9:55:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> like, something about syringes flying around in the air as weapons make me VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
[9:55:13] <+Makouzer> syringe funnels
[9:55:17] <%PatNTheHat> They do a good job of making us feel vulnerable without feeling weak in this game. In StB there was Zenos, in ShB there was light poisoning, and here there's our friends
[9:55:21] <%DashXero> If it comes down to it, I vote that we keep Al.
[9:55:28] <%KineticZen> Gotta inject the enemy with the flavor
[9:55:48] <arkv01> man I really love the music so far
[9:56:00] <%JoshManVGH> The souls of all my friends shall be my sword!
[9:56:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> Haha don't log out...
[9:56:21] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Zenos has joined your party without your consent
[9:56:25] <%shanna_become_gamer> @PatStaresAt Dumb question: why is it important to finish as fast as possible? Because you're excited? Don't want to get spoiled?
[9:56:34] <jamesofn> banger alert
[9:56:35] <StarMechV> yoo siddenly main theme

[9:57:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> please don't mess with our step children FF14

[9:58:09] <karl_rex> I bet Aymeric
[9:58:16] <@QueequegTheater> @DashXero yes
[9:58:24] <+Tizona824> @dashxero Yes and no
[9:58:28] <%HotSauceFiend> girl?
[9:58:28] <%DashXero> Huh. Interesting.
[9:58:31] <%PatNTheHat> Just let us shove them in our ass until we need them
[9:58:36] <dan_g_v> yeyeye girl!
[9:58:37] <+MoonObscure> YAY
[9:58:50] <@QueequegTheater> As much as they're pricks, Sharlayan might be the safest place in the world for the talismans right now
[9:58:50] <jorniev> YAAAY
[9:58:51] <%kid_flashionable> She's okay!
[9:58:56] <dan_g_v> who?
[9:58:57] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[9:59:05] <%HotSauceFiend> Wait do all the elephant people have an indian accent or is that just a coincidence
[9:59:16] <dan_g_v> all the people
[9:59:18] <%PatNTheHat> @QueequegTheater What about shoving them up our ass?
[9:59:24] <dan_g_v> well in this region
[9:59:27] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater We only have so much room
[9:59:27] <+Tizona824> it's a thavnairian accent
[9:59:31] <+Makouzer> @hotsaucefiend whole thavnair has it
[9:59:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> they look like Indian elephants so it fits
[9:59:38] <$realm_forge> I have fallen for you chosen one! Let us share a night of fiery passion before you go!
[9:59:42] <+athuramn> @hotsaucefiend I was literally wondering the same thing lol
[9:59:42] <+Havictos> @HotSauceFiend It's everyone in thavnir. Thavnir is ffxiv India
[9:59:52] <lostvayne91> just look at the architecture of radz a han
[10:00:03] <SaltyAzteca> it was a team effort!
[10:00:05] <%HotSauceFiend> sorry "Thavnir" Accent. I was just surprised to hear that accent in this game
[10:00:22] <+BIumen> it shows restraint
[10:00:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Mission: GET ''EM!
[10:00:37] <@QueequegTheater> Zenos is a goddamn walking nuke
[10:00:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> sharlyan is still an issue
[10:00:43] <%PatNTheHat> Just gotta worry about the end of the world
[10:00:44] <+Havictos> Garlemald is done
[10:00:53] <dan_g_v> @HotSauceFiend oh yeah, they have plenty of different accents
[10:00:56] <stevenellis386> yea but people are gonna be people, ya know?
[10:01:01] <jorniev> this lady just solved so many problems
[10:01:01] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[10:01:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> FLOWER BE LIT
[10:01:04] <+Havictos> mommy time?
[10:01:08] <+JustToWatch> at least until Sephiroth shows up
[10:01:08] <Sol_Install> flower
[10:01:09] <dan_g_v> there we go
[10:01:12] <Sol_Install> Flowie
[10:01:15] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I mean, there's still two unnamed Convocation members we haven't found
[10:01:21] <dan_g_v> strong emotions, right?
[10:01:21] <$realm_forge> Butt flower
[10:01:21] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat is Sharlyan Japan?
[10:01:25] <%kid_flashionable> Aww it happy flower now
[10:01:25] <Sol_Install> Undertale Flower
[10:01:28] <lostvayne91> its flowey
[10:01:29] <stevenellis386> theres always gonna be some type of crazy just running around
[10:01:42] <@QueequegTheater> @Makouzer No, Doma is
[10:01:46] <+Makouzer> POWER OF FEELS
[10:01:49] <StarMechV> you know. gotta hand it to the FF14 team. It is hard even for the best RPGs to make you care for basically townie NPCs. Yet this game has these scenes like this and it truly makes you feel like you're actually doing good in the world
[10:01:50] <+fetrigon> @makouzer i think Singapore
[10:01:51] <Ids560> soon the only problem will be literally every lalafell except pipin, tataru, and krile
[10:02:01] <dan_g_v> power of friendship incoming!
[10:02:06] <StarMechV> SUPER PWOER OF FRIENDSHIP LET'S GO
[10:02:07] <%Kiyosuki> hingashi is the direct Japan allegory
[10:02:11] <%amused_platypus> but for every problem that exists theres still many more, theres still the void which I hope we one day delve into.... perhaps with aid of the first
[10:02:15] <AllenDeadman> huh
[10:02:18] <%Kiyosuki> Kugane is the only part of it we get to visit
[10:02:21] <stevenellis386> yea this game has incredible writing
[10:02:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> Akasha? the root?
[10:02:26] <%PatNTheHat> @Ids560 0 potato plan
[10:02:26] <Zourath> Oh my god, the power of friendship is going to solve everything
[10:02:28] <+BIumen> SHE SAID THE THING
[10:02:32] <%valriot> TORN FROM THE HEAVEBS
[10:02:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> Faith Energy
[10:02:32] <+wmeldrum> some people call aether "the force"
[10:02:40] <marvel877> So...midochlorians?
[10:02:43] <@QueequegTheater> @fetrigon Dude, Sharlayan is blatantly Athens
[10:02:50] <@QueequegTheater> I CLAPPED
[10:02:57] <@QueequegTheater> But like unironically
[10:02:58] <$realm_forge> It exists mostly in the balls
[10:02:59] <lostvayne91> :O
[10:03:00] <+Makouzer> I was comparing it to japan cuz both are pretty advanced and really isolated, but I guess that can be many other countries aswell
[10:03:07] <StarMechV> THIS GAME
[10:03:09] <+JustToWatch> just like Goku
[10:03:11] <DruidHaruka233> LIMIT BREAK
[10:03:15] <+Havictos> it's the ECHO!?
[10:03:18] <+Kyma1020> THE COLOR IS EXACTLY LIKE THE LB BAR
[10:03:21] <StarMechV> WE ARE GETTING FUCKING SPIRAL POWER
[10:03:21] <@QueequegTheater> LIMIT BREAK CANON
[10:03:22] <%Mr_Pylon> It's how you make a spirit bomb
[10:03:24] <AllenDeadman> HUH
[10:03:25] <ricotez> limit gauge is actually akasa gauge?
[10:03:26] <Treasure_Vault> Determination?
[10:03:31] <+Havictos> or limit break energy?
[10:03:33] <jorniev> DETERMINATION
[10:03:35] <lostvayne91> @Kyma1020  dont blow my mind like that
[10:03:40] <RushUnplugged> Sharlayan is absolutely greek-inspired, Sage comes from there and all the skill names are greek
[10:03:40] <%kyh9> YOSHI-P, YOU SHOULD KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
[10:03:42] <%HotSauceFiend> so Pat said the main story quest has few objectives left, how many years did it take to get to this point. Trying to guess how long the game will keep putting out content for
[10:03:42] <marvel877> So a Quickening of sorts?
[10:03:48] <%kyh9> SO it's the Limit Break ability
[10:03:50] <+Makouzer> spiral flower energy?
[10:03:54] <SaltyAzteca> the game explained limit breaks
[10:04:05] <ricotez> the game is getting at least another decade of content
[10:04:07] <+Aokaay> okay insane theory but what if the flower lets us LB4
[10:04:20] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The talking elephant just told you it's borderline pseudoscience
[10:04:25] <@QueequegTheater> This is surreal
[10:04:26] <CurrySauseBandit> Quick eat it for the 4th bar.
[10:04:32] <+fetrigon> @queequegtheater just aesthetically or how the society is setup as well?
[10:04:37] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> So what were you going to say before the limit break revelation?
[10:04:40] <+MoonObscure> yes
[10:04:40] <SaltyAzteca> duuuuuude
[10:04:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> SOUNDS RAD
[10:04:41] <TimetodiveLTX> that's hype
[10:04:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> REZ ERRYBODY

[10:04:54] <jamesofn> SHARE YOUR AKASA WITH ME
[10:04:54] <Profmcstevie> Warriors of Limit Break
[10:04:56] <SaltyAzteca> All the fukken warriors
[10:04:56] <stevenellis386> just summons Meteor
[10:04:59] <Louie_Salmon> ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
[10:05:00] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Goku Spirit bomd this problem
[10:05:01] <+JustToWatch> Super LB God Super LB
[10:05:02] <+Ryaotz> That would be sick
[10:05:03] <Treasure_Vault> You need to lb on all your classes in every timeline
[10:05:03] <+Tizona824> Spirit bomb?
[10:05:03] <MaybeFalco> million stabs, but its all LBs
[10:05:04] <tanithmagnus> YO LB4 LETS GO
[10:05:05] <%kyh9> IF I DONT, WHO WILL?  ALL OF US!
[10:05:06] <ricotez> dps please use the lb1m
[10:05:06] <%Ynkubus_> Limitless Break!
[10:05:07] <KonekoSilvertail> PLEASE
[10:05:11] <Daxalog> Imagine just levelling and you have to give your LB meter to some random raid,
[10:05:13] <%DashXero> A Limit Break Spirit Bomb?
[10:05:16] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat gather energy LB?
[10:05:16] <@goose_attack_almanac> I would imagine the Akasa runs both ways.
[10:05:19] <BasicOutRage> SPIRIT LB
[10:05:23] <+Tizona824> Spiral energy?
[10:05:24] <$realm_forge> Turn the planet into a spirit bomb
[10:05:25] <godzookylives> 24 hour stream?
[10:05:28] <MidnightPacif1c> 10,000 knight knights of the round
[10:05:31] <lostvayne91> that was some crazy lore. somethhing else other than aether
[10:05:36] <%ElkRiverDog> Frack you guys are right its a spirit bomb
[10:05:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's all the warriors, where every job you levelled up has their trainer show up and do their own LB4
[10:05:42] <tanithmagnus> are we going to have to race Alicae for the LB Spirit Bomb?
[10:05:52] <@QueequegTheater> IT WOULD BE SO HYPE
[10:05:56] <+JustToWatch> how much do you think they would have to pay to actually bring Goku into the game
[10:05:57] <+Makouzer> baldesion annex music is best
[10:06:01] <tanithmagnus> is Akasha the Noise?
[10:06:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @QueequegTheater gotta level alts to prog
[10:06:23] <AllenDeadman> hmm
[10:06:34] <%ElkRiverDog> It should be a rule that if a Lalafel is going to be a quest giver that they need to stand on something tall
[10:06:35] <%HotSauceFiend> so the noise is zetsubo
[10:06:40] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is the noise just zodiark?
[10:06:43] <%UvBenServed> Didn't the Dancer quest line go into that?
[10:06:43] <+Tizona824> So is despair the ground state of the universe?
[10:06:52] <Profmcstevie> The physical manifestation of a bad day
[10:06:54] <dan_g_v> so, we are officially a magical girl anime game, I love it!
[10:06:56] <%Delenay> dont give up skeleton
[10:06:57] <tanithmagnus> holy shit its Persona 3
[10:07:00] <Srthunda> did that quest just give you archon bread?
[10:07:00] <+Tizona824> No, Zodiark was summoned to stop the noise
[10:07:01] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Speaking of music the Reaper office music sounds like you walked into a smooth Jazz club
[10:07:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Maybe the WoL is now close enough to an Ancient that they might succumb to it
[10:07:05] <televisedrevolting> So that guy who told you that all those years ago was just foreshadowing?
[10:07:12] <AllenDeadman> flowah

[10:08:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> there are so many little details for character story telling
[10:08:34] <+Kduff89> Its like when Narancia had a moment where he lamented about pizza and Fugo and then fucking ate it
[10:08:34] <arkv01> this scene sponsored by BORGER KING
[10:08:34] <DruidHaruka233> Hey can I have that pickle

[10:10:23] <%HotSauceFiend> that mirror looks suspicious
[10:10:27] <$realm_forge> A discussion about what they’re all going to do afterwards / days until they retire is dangerously close to breaking out
[10:10:32] <Sunstalker> Burgers and pizza on a table with picknick sammiches in a nice basket is such a weird fucking mishmash
[10:10:34] <karl_rex> Glamour desk

[10:11:57] <lostvayne91> actually aniamted the cookie
[10:11:58] <+Makouzer> the animation is off the limits
[10:11:58] <Edible_Enthusiasm> she halved it clean
[10:12:06] <General_Terro> "look at the money we spent"
[10:12:12] <SeaReally> whats with the mirror
[10:12:14] <%HotSauceFiend> look at at macaron
[10:12:15] <%Kiyosuki> that FFXIV cook book is legit for a reason
[10:12:15] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That Macarron is the size of a normal burguer FFS
[10:12:19] <StarMechV> YoshiP probably had to delay the release date FOR THESE FOOD ALONE
[10:12:21] <%kyh9> At the final End-game tier scene where everyone gets together, the burger and cookie will be on the battle line too
[10:12:24] <%Kiyosuki> these japanese games take the food seriously

[10:12:39] <TimetodiveLTX> you could kill a man with those burgers
[10:12:39] <shadowstreakXIII> THIS is what the 2 weeks were for
[10:12:40] <+JustToWatch> kind of amazing what they're able to make this engine do
[10:12:41] <StarMechV> the entire delay
[10:12:43] <SeaReally> tighten up the cookies on level 3
[10:12:43] <Louie_Salmon> Okay, during the slow part near the end, this song also becomes "Say you won't let go"
[10:12:45] <%kyh9> LMAO

[10:34:09] <%emperordread> I just looked over now and that hotbar looks like chaos
[10:34:10] <%EynoStiles> not including paige streams. so much unpaid overtime.
[10:34:11] <KnivesEve> so i got kicked out before i got to pick up the first quest. and since then i havent been able to log in cause of server lobby issues.... hope you had fun pat :)
[10:34:15] <%barkon345> @shadow_yomi oh the story is increadible. but I was referring to if it was your first time having the server crash on you.
[10:34:16] <+MoonObscure> ???
[10:34:32] <+MoonObscure> ooof
[10:34:36] <xxshadowxx416> @mk_ineptitude no suffer like the rest of us
[10:34:36] <tanarath> There's shitposting on twitter, too, that's super work-related.
[10:34:51] <%barkon345> I couldn't believe how quickly he got in
[10:35:01] <%EynoStiles> is this typical for new content
[10:35:07] <%valriot> Just wait Pat
[10:35:09] <RushUnplugged> I logged out at the 40something queue, napped, got back to 4k, I blame you Pat
[10:35:12] <jorniev> this was pretty good
[10:35:22] <%PatNTheHat> Thing I'll be able to log in on my birthday Sunday or am I fucked?

[10:36:00] <%barkon345> @eynostiles this is the worst this game has ever been. iv been through expansion launches on this ga.e and thus is the worst I have ever seen.
[10:36:06] <tanarath> But seriously, making sure vods ate on youtube, testing games, talking to devs, planning schedules, understanding how long your pc & setup will work & planning for that, finacials etc.
[10:36:26] <%barkon345> *through 2 expansion launches
[10:36:35] <Daxalog> Wait. Did he say that specifically as. Ye Ye (Ye)
[10:36:39] <Sokawaiibebe> Wait I thought the stream ended?!
[10:36:42] <Profmcstevie> Nah pat spends his hours kissing Paige and making sick burns on twitter
[10:36:43] <%barkon345> just got kicked again.
[10:36:52] <tanarath> oh, and figuring out what's best to stream as shit changes constantly.
[10:36:57] <%barkon345> I'm just going to try again tomorrow
[10:37:07] <%EynoStiles> @patstaresat These streams are usually your most watched streams you had 2k watchers at one point.
[10:37:10] <RushUnplugged> @barkon345 I'd say Raubahn EX was worse because being in game, but not being able to proceed felt worse lol
