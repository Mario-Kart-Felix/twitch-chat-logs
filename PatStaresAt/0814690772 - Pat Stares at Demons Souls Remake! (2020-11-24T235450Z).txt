[0:20:18] <%AzureGale> Oneblooddesthreetwosekiro
[0:20:18] <Sotetsu> Sekiro isn't a souls game
[0:20:19] <%sumrand0> Patches aka the DS Pat
[0:20:22] <%Hasmeister96> Why is Sekiro worse than DS2?
[0:20:23] <justinjones1989> Ds1 is so annoying
[0:20:25] <+TreeeFOX> sekiro the worst?
[0:20:25] <RubberFistFight> You loved Sekiro though pat
[0:20:29] <%Zeikier> ringed city is Just Okay
[0:20:30] <%superc37> bloodborne>ds1>every thing else>ds2
[0:20:31] <+RyTYoung> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:20:32] <Tuna_Can_0> FeelsBadMan
[0:20:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> And?
[0:20:35] <%coyotesenpai> coyotesenpai subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat! If you or anyone else likes the humor in Yakuza you might like Cromartie high school. It's an older anime. Watch it in English. the opening is a national treasure.
[0:20:36] <Calek> it's also not a souls game
[0:20:37] <%Hasmeister96> Aight fair enough
[0:20:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> The worst Souls game is best than a lot of shit
[0:20:39] <%CalderGaming> and a ton of useless skills
[0:20:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH OBRAA DINN SO GOOD
[0:20:41] <+ThunderZebraKing> Pat is a weapon boy
[0:20:41] <%Monkeyweed21> but that weapon is rad
[0:20:42] <%roscoe_rosaline> Fair
[0:20:42] <TheGazingEye> yup
[0:20:42] <Darkfire346> BUT ITS FUCKING COOL
[0:20:44] <%Ipsenscastle> BB>DS1>DeS>DS3>Sek>DS2
[0:20:45] <%tusk102> it's not really a souls game in gameplay
[0:20:46] <DianaTheAscian> yup
[0:20:46] <%YakumoYomi> Fair
[0:20:47] <+deviljhojho_> as if you werent gonna main uchi anyways
[0:20:48] <+waltzqueen> fair enough
[0:20:49] <Saltmeisterr> Is sekiro even a souls game?
[0:20:49] <%Zeikier> sekiro feels the most complete even if it mostly feels like a test run of the mechanics for a later game
[0:20:50] <+Pachi3000> But it's still a good game
[0:20:54] <%caramelatte1> sekiro has ZERO replayability
[0:20:58] <+TheCrispyBoi> one weapon killed replay for me
[0:20:59] <Darkfire346> BUT NINJAS
[0:20:59] <UlriktheSlayer1> facts sekiro overrated
[0:21:00] <%Zeikier> sekiro is a Tenchu game
[0:21:04] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt hmmm Do the arm weapons dont count?
[0:21:04] <%SaiyanShoto> And it's repetitive as fuuuuuck
[0:21:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sekiro definitely doesn't have replayability.
[0:21:07] <RubberFistFight> Sekiro replays are actually good fun, but i actually totally can't argue with your logic there.
[0:21:09] <%tizz86> ok y'all gotta look away for a bit for the streaming waifus
[0:21:11] <%s1rcuit> that's the reason I liked it over DS
[0:21:12] <+TaylOctopus91> !uptime
[0:21:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 21m 24s.
[0:21:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt plus it's not really souls like
[0:21:15] <%SaiyanShoto> It's just parrying over and over and over
[0:21:19] <%sumrand0> Seikro quickly got repetitive due to restricted weapon options
[0:21:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> Finally... friday...
[0:21:22] <%coreyyotto> Sekiro is fun to replay and absolutely stomp over everything
[0:21:34] <%superc37> nioh is just better sekiro tbh
[0:21:38] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt how did you get your 3080?
[0:21:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, whatever you do, DON'T get in the kiln
[0:21:40] <Meltgar> @SaiyanShoto Yeah, this is much it
[0:21:41] <+krabsan> DS1>BLOOD>DS3>Des>SEKIRO>DS2
[0:21:42] <%tusk102> nice!
[0:21:47] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt finish obra dinn. shit get crazy. your the reason i played it SeemsGood
[0:21:49] <Darkfire346> Oim a boikey mahn frohm a boikey gang
[0:21:51] <%a_c_chirns> I watched one Aunty Donna video and now it keeps showing up in my recommended
[0:21:51] <%Zeikier> sekiro has a lot of problems of input lag even moreso than DS and BB cuz of how fatal screwing up is
[0:21:56] <%coreyyotto> Like, the thing with Sekiro is it's GREAT if Wolf's fighting style is the same as your fighting style
[0:21:57] <Midnight188> ....clock up?
[0:22:03] <%roscoe_rosaline> Love Aunty Donna.
[0:22:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cappuccinoguil BUT...BUT THE FIRST FLAME THO
[0:22:04] <%Zeikier> but I think it feels the most complete of a souls game I've played since BB and DeS
[0:22:06] <antshadow14> decade
[0:22:07] <%debugdrawray_> have you checked out oo's/fourze/w?
[0:22:10] <+deviljhojho_> WORM

[0:22:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> CLOCK UP
[0:22:33] <%Hasmeister96> Honestly Pat every time I watch the RKG LP of Sekiro, I keep thinking of ways to improve the game, but then I just turn it into a Devil May Cry game
[0:22:33] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k don't get in the kiln, it's where we put the pots, it's too hot and you'll burn.
[0:22:34] <%Bt_Robot> How did that ghost get all those robots?

[0:23:16] <%Willbo_Baggins> @tusk102 deadass that was my alternative if I couldn't get one, I was gonna go for saberforge
[0:23:17] <%VvTacoSaladvV> It has Freddie Mercury as a character tho

[0:30:12] <%collind99> @cappuccinoguil because it makes it harder to see enemies sometimes
[0:30:17] <jellssssss20> Why does this tower have a heart?
[0:30:22] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt isn't this the level that miyazaki said bloodborne was based on?
[0:30:24] <%Solid_Stro> The boss arena is the real boss for the Maneater fight lytLURK
[0:30:31] <RubberFistFight> fear of hearts
[0:30:32] <%Ipsenscastle> a fear of your own heartbeat

Sorry to go off tangent, but I can't recall you ever saying why you fell off of destiny 2 as hard as you did. Incidentally, what are your thoughts on its newest expansion?
[0:32:48] <+ThunderZebraKing> Bluepoint did a bangup job with this
[0:32:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt unlikely because they are made of rocks

[0:35:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> @vvtacosaladvv hopefully a proper remake of dark souls. DaS: remastered is an embarasment.
[0:35:13] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @tusk102 I think they may be finished being dong simple "remasters." They're fully a remake studio now.
[0:35:15] <chronoxgp> you lose tendancy if you fall off the map in a invasion
[0:35:16] <i_am_therydon> you have to want it
[0:35:18] <%Hasmeister96> @Laecerelius is that hard to accomplish?
[0:35:22] <Aydarkzero> gotta get paid
[0:35:27] <+ThunderZebraKing> Why is shit such a yurt?
[0:35:27] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt how does world tendency and manipulating it work
[0:35:31] <%tusk102> @VvTacoSaladvV It was a joke, hence the Kappa
[0:35:31] <tolloponik> his name is Yurt
[0:35:33] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait what were they doing?
[0:35:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude loves murder
[0:35:36] <chronoxgp> you also lose a level if you fall off the map in a invasion
[0:35:38] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ah

[0:35:39] <%a_c_chirns> dank Bloodborne chains

[0:36:22] <Smugteddy> the Heart is peacing out thanks to this explanation
[0:36:32] <%Hasmeister96> @Aydarkzero So kill yourself in the Nexus?
[0:36:40] <PanicSwytch> Ive heard this more than 3 times per stream
[0:36:41] <%tusk102> @himbearbedtime it helped make bloodborne bc miyazaki said he wanted to channel the feeling of this level into the game
[0:36:46] <%Ipsenscastle> My tendency is green, should I see a doctor?
[0:36:56] <Aydarkzero> @Hasmeister96 thats the strat
[0:37:04] <kingmemelord97> so its a debate of health vs tools
[0:37:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt to echo woolie: how do we get to battle tendency
[0:37:12] <megaman_sentinel> someone clip that and make it a command
[0:37:14] <Mangahero18> Do you think they are remaking Bloodborne and thats why they havent ported it to the fricken PC yet?

[0:37:40] <Captbutt> visions of pure white sounds kinda...
[0:37:40] <%blastyoboots> you can say something like it in one of them
[0:37:46] <jellssssss20> Uh, if you think about it, probably can't say Pure White
[0:37:48] <kingmemelord97> vaulting ?
[0:37:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat desires a PURE WHITE WORLD
[0:37:51] <CappuccinoGuil> I've seen messages with "White Tendency" in them, this is odd
[0:37:51] <%blastyoboots> white soul tendency is somewhere
[0:37:54] <%tusk102> @VvTacoSaladvV that's basically bloodborne
[0:37:56] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat just wants to be pure
[0:37:57] <Profmcstevie> "Try White" would be an excellent message if possible

[0:38:22] <%blastyoboots> I've definitely seen "White Soul Tendency" in one of them, which isn't correct but gets the point across
[0:38:27] <%saadi90> As a brown guy... I fear pure white tendency

[0:42:19] <%Bt_Robot> HE WILL NOT KILL THOMAS
[0:42:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> and what's the benefit?
[0:42:20] <%Daoshinto> thats amazing
[0:42:21] <UlriktheSlayer1> fuuuuck him
[0:42:23] <nilla_24> like in bloodborne
[0:42:23] <%Zeikier> except Thomas ofc
[0:42:26] <%tank7013> In other words he can permanently fuck your game
[0:42:26] <Parapattern> Yurt loves to surp his Gurt
[0:42:27] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> He will ruin mage and faith builds
[0:42:27] <%Hasmeister96> So he's that dude from Bloodborne?
[0:42:27] <kingmemelord97> so its a dead mans switch ?
[0:42:28] <%Treuan> Yurt is Lautrec on heroine
[0:42:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @UlriktheSlayer1 THAT'S why he's worse
[0:42:29] <jellssssss20> Do a Help-Yurt run
[0:42:29] <%HefestoForges> patches evolved
[0:42:29] <linSP> He‚Äôs the suspicious man from bloodborne
[0:42:29] <%blastyoboots> you shouldn't have told them
[0:42:29] <peachy996> A tradition continued in Bloodeborn
[0:42:29] <%koolaid_kevster> why he mustve had a bad childhood
[0:42:30] <sychevatel> that's fucked up
[0:42:31] <Aydarkzero> actual imposter
[0:42:32] <%Bt_Robot> JUST ALL CASTERS
[0:42:32] <Darkfire346> So hes a bitch?
[0:42:34] <peachy996> Sorta
[0:42:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHY?
[0:42:35] <$lotharrio> Yeah but you are gonna kill everyone before NG+ anyway, right?
[0:42:35] <%koolaid_kevster> its not his fault
[0:42:35] <huskarl_zap> I think he attacks you after two deaths
[0:42:36] <Captbutt> and not a single one of them is like "huhhh this yogurt fucker is murdering us??"
[0:42:38] <%Ipsenscastle> Yurt is way cooler than Lautrec or the Abhorrent Beast
[0:42:39] <%Monkeyweed21> When you reach pure Black tendency he gives up and gives you his armor @PatStaresAt
[0:42:39] <LunarRemix> But do you get something if you 'complete' his quest?
[0:42:40] <WeebFever> for his cool armor
[0:42:41] <%coreyyotto> and he does that even if you don't free him
[0:42:41] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt wait but what's the benefit?
[0:42:42] <GameOver_Here> His armor is dope.
[0:42:42] <jellssssss20> this shortcut?
[0:42:42] <+deviljhojho_> yurt has ended many a noob's run
[0:42:43] <UlriktheSlayer1> @CappuccinoGuil god damn well good to know
[0:42:43] <%Solid_Stro> His armor is cool so kill for that too
[0:42:46] <%za7az> Does he ever explain why he kills NPCs?
[0:42:48] <%WhereIsWill> cuz his sick armor

[0:44:17] <jellssssss20> Oh? I didn't know that/ any of the lore of this game
[0:44:18] <%tank7013> I... never picked up on that
[0:44:19] <Mangahero18> Giant Bugs with human faces. Okay...okay.
[0:44:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Did you guys know of this manga called Berserk?
[0:44:23] <warmnoid> that's sick (in a good way)
[0:44:24] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Even Bloodborne never quite gets an atmosphere like this.
[0:44:24] <%Solid_Stro> So this is the One Reborn‚Äôs vacation spot?
[0:44:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This looks like it needs to be burned.
[0:44:28] <+TheCrispyBoi> das a bloodborne

[0:44:33] <%RyTYoung> WutFace
[0:44:34] <Smugteddy> Wooliehole at risk
[0:44:37] <%HefestoForges> it's a bad look to do that
[0:44:38] <%Laecerelius> Just make those demons, man
[0:44:38] <+ThunderZebraKing> It wouldnt be a souls game without a touch of body horror
[0:44:39] <%blastyoboots> THOSE PUMPING THINGS
[0:44:39] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt aren't the small ones aborted fetuses that get yeetus into the pit?
[0:44:40] <megaman_sentinel> human centipede ?
[0:44:40] <%WhereIsWill> human centipede Kreygasm
[0:44:43] <%roscoe_rosaline> Looks like it worked well.
[0:44:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh yea
[0:44:44] <Krakenoid> sometimes you just gotta throw evil magiscience at the wall and see what sticks
[0:44:45] <+MoonObscure> yes
[0:44:48] <Mangahero18> So they are literal human centipedes
[0:44:50] <GoogleyGareth> How many times do you try with the same result to finally throw in the towel?
[0:44:52] <CappuccinoGuil> WHAT?! A Berserk reference? NO WAY
[0:44:53] <UlriktheSlayer1> what isnt a berserk reference with fromsoft games?
[0:44:53] <RyuuAoi> Just nuke it.
[0:44:55] <mr_slaide> New monk is kind of a dick.
[0:44:55] <%Not_Dutch_> what's a berserk?
[0:44:58] <tolloponik> oh I dodn't notic that detail about the body
[0:44:58] <%UvBenServed> What's that smell?
[0:45:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> can you stab that?
[0:45:02] <jellssssss20> Is someone taking selfies over there?
[0:45:04] <%blastyoboots> oh yeah this is berserk as SHIT no WONDER the bugs look like Behelits
[0:45:07] <ArtemisCroc> also the man faced bugs in blighttown in ds1
[0:45:09] <Ner234> It's the meatball Pog
[0:45:12] <%emperordread> Rollin around at the speed of sound
[0:45:12] <mr_slaide> Yes, but can we graft more asses on them?
[0:45:14] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[0:45:15] <%collind99> It‚Äôs why the new maneater design is actually more lore correct
[0:45:16] <%tusk102> NICE
[0:45:17] <+campasino> "Yes I'm the goo and throbbing mass designer"
[0:45:20] <%Zeikier> C L U T C H

[0:45:43] <Krakenoid> oh god that's right. this game has weird soul tendancy shit
[0:45:45] <%blastyoboots> ah you need pure black not pure white?
[0:45:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt aren't the small ones aborted fetus or smth?
[0:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> its poo
[0:45:50] <Mangahero18> Do those giant meatball guys respawn?
[0:45:54] <Captbutt> pretty sure this is a reference to persona 5 somehow
[0:45:58] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt is it referencing the qliphoth in Berserk?
[0:45:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Imagine Bloodborne 2 with this
[0:46:02] <%Pacifcgrim> shout out to the goo man
[0:46:03] <+Grayhammatter> the most immaculate goo
[0:46:03] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I was worried about the man centipedes going into the remake but Bluepoint did a great job with them.
[0:46:03] <%stardustcrusad3r> would you drink the goo
[0:46:04] <+ThunderZebraKing> The gootisans
[0:46:06] <tolloponik> thats a different area

[0:46:25] <peachy996> Imagine that the goo in in your shoes
[0:46:28] <%Zeikier> WE HAVE ABORTED FETUSES AT HOME
[0:46:35] <Parapattern> Let us drink the sarcophagus goo
[0:46:35] <Mirrorcatch> goo technician

[0:46:49] <critfumble_> x to doubt
[0:46:50] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig truth
[0:46:51] <+TheCrispyBoi> yup
[0:46:54] <%crimsonharvest> I heard the ancient name of Boletaria is the Mushroom Kingdom
[0:46:54] <%a_c_chirns> I hate this shit
[0:47:00] <+AXL808> what runner up?
[0:47:00] <Meltgar> Having a GOO'd time Kappa
[0:47:02] <+MoonObscure> lol
[0:47:02] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Not just any swamp, a blood swamp at that.
[0:47:03] <DSD24> But it has the worst boss?
[0:47:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zeikier you can get your kuva elsewhere
[0:47:04] <Smugteddy> bigus goopus
[0:47:04] <himbearbedtime> And Junji Ito
[0:47:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh look, a Berserk reference
[0:47:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why can't Demon's Souls climb?
[0:47:09] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Oh nice. breaking wheels!
[0:47:10] <Meta_Outhorii> Geez, the way the blood vessels pulse is just
[0:47:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> oh
[0:47:16] <tolloponik> oh shit that Berserk reference
[0:47:16] <GoogleyGareth> I wanna ride the Wooden Wheel!
[0:47:18] <%Ynkubus_> Oh hey breaking wheels
[0:47:21] <AMaidIndeed> didn't this used to run like shit on the PS3 because of all the loading?
[0:47:28] <Aydarkzero> confused screaming the whole time
[0:47:37] <%tusk102> @AMaidIndeed yES
[0:47:38] <kingmemelord97> i know vg logic but how has this go not have several infections
[0:47:39] <Smugteddy> YOU HATE TO SEE IT FOLKS
[0:47:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat juiced his character? Nooooo
[0:47:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Which part of the tower is the Old Monks cummies @PatStaresAt ?
[0:47:45] <GoogleyGareth> Nothing in this level wants to live.
[0:47:45] <%Zeikier> this was the best thing to go to blind on my first playthrough
[0:47:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt whats the pvp soul level in this game?
[0:47:50] <%HefestoForges> behind you chat
[0:47:53] <RyuuAoi> He op. Told ya!
[0:47:54] <%DeadManProp> Is this remake still meant to be easier than DS and BB?
[0:47:56] <%Ipsenscastle> do the giant pulsing blood vessels not freak you out?
[0:47:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @AMaidIndeed no, it was Valley of Defilement that sucked LUL
[0:47:58] <%tusk102> @CommanderSqueaks he's level 47
[0:47:59] <%Bt_Robot> THIS IS WHERE THEY MAKE THE WHEEL SKELETONS FOR DARK SOULS
[0:48:06] <Ner234> Maneater is a fuck
[0:48:12] <kingmemelord97> @HefestoForges you stop that
[0:48:21] <%Monkeyweed21> It took max almost 10 hours to beat this zone
[0:48:26] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @DeadManProp It's almost exactly like the original which means it's probably the easiest Souls game.
[0:48:30] <Smugteddy> thou has been fuketh
[0:48:31] <%Hasmeister96> I just realised these enemies are just the "Thing"
[0:48:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> HENTAI LEVELS ARE RISING
[0:48:41] <%WhereIsWill> game looks much better than previous btw pat good work
[0:48:47] <CappuccinoGuil> That moment when you realize DS1 has fewer swamps than DeS
[0:48:48] <Meta_Outhorii> I'm honestly surprised trees can grow/live down here.
[0:48:49] <lastnamesilverlastname> The Thing is a christmas movie now
[0:48:55] <+MoonObscure> lol
[0:48:55] <%Bt_Robot> Just random pulsing veins, great.
[0:48:56] <Aydarkzero> Pat did good
[0:48:57] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it took max 10 hours to beat this zone
[0:48:59] <+deviljhojho_> wait, its all bloodborne
[0:49:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> You are doing a good job Pat
[0:49:03] <RyuuAoi> Pat said he beat this game in nine hours.
[0:49:10] <%HefestoForges> well shit

[0:49:23] <nastybagl> pat i love you
[0:49:23] <+ThunderZebraKing> What's their deal? Why they lookin like phantoms?
[0:49:23] <Krakenoid> that was just camera fucky
[0:49:24] <+GummyDavidson> is this a good starting point into the souls series?
[0:49:25] <$lotharrio> It was the HDR's fault!
[0:49:25] <Meltgar> LUL
[0:49:26] <%Hasmeister96> @lastnamesilverlastname I should probably check if it's either on Netflix or Prime
[0:49:26] <%DeadManProp> psaDogchamp
[0:49:27] <%Daoshinto> WHY no HDR?
[0:49:27] <Klefth> U ded
[0:49:28] <%a_c_chirns> K O
[0:49:29] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:49:30] <leinadtonu> hdREEEEEEEE
[0:49:31] <%MalekDracarus> @deviljhojho_ Always has been.
[0:49:31] <warmnoid> "HDR this bolt"
[0:49:31] <%collind99> PAT
[0:49:32] <%blastyoboots> that felt like payback for your magic build
[0:49:33] <%nevan_44> psaUp
[0:49:34] <+AXL808> "Upper Bullshit"
[0:49:34] <ftwsam98> you were saying?
[0:49:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you're doing a good job.
[0:49:35] <+orphan_ash> BibleThump BibleThump
[0:49:36] <CappuccinoGuil> How were you one-shotted? You're a BATTLE MAGE
[0:49:36] <%Bt_Robot> Was that a black phantom mindflayer?
[0:49:36] <tattleworm> you're allowed to use it, you just gotta buy us all hdr monitors first
[0:49:38] <%AFlyingTaco1> @gummydavidson Yes
[0:49:41] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe HDR killed pat
[0:49:43] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt good job on the settings pat your dick is very very big
[0:49:44] <Meta_Outhorii> Black phantom squid guards
[0:49:45] <%tusk102> @GummyDavidson this is the first souls game so ye
[0:49:46] <%barrakuta371> Oh boy that's a long way back
[0:49:50] <%Ipsenscastle> was that super strong or is Pat using a 'wet paper bag' build?
[0:49:51] <tolloponik> this is why 360 noscoping is a bad thing to do
[0:49:51] <henshin2289> Eat shit lose lol love you tho
[0:49:53] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> no shortcut?
[0:49:54] <+MoonObscure> the sounds are so damn good
[0:50:03] <PanicSwytch> HDR is the true enemy
[0:50:04] <%SirGO0SE> HDR : He Dead ROFL!
[0:50:08] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Of course, your brightness is perfect.
[0:50:08] <Aydarkzero> [darkness consumes you]
[0:50:10] <kingmemelord97> i love this tech talk as pat does through the demon souls version of akira
[0:50:17] <RubberFistFight> The reason why OBS doesn't do HDR is because Jim, the lead dev on OBS, considers it beneath him and has no plans at all to implement anything past SDR and 709 colourspace.
[0:50:18] <%HefestoForges> psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat
[0:50:22] <Smugteddy> "See the details of this massive L on full hdr "
[0:50:23] <Aydarkzero> optimal settings afterall
[0:50:24] <Darkfire346> I can never get HDR to work properly on my OLED TV using my PC. RGB looks better than HDR with YrCbR 4:4:4 and I dont get why
[0:50:27] <%VvTacoSaladvV> FromSoft was brave enough to make several parts of this game almost pitch black in 2009, and Bluepoint stayed true to it.
[0:50:28] <+NerevaRising> The return of perfectly calibrated tv Tm
[0:50:28] <RubberFistFight> So feel free to go tell him what you think about that.
[0:50:28] <leinadtonu> I already feel oppressed by the dark
[0:50:29] <smilemychild> tower of Latria is probabky my favorite Demons Souls stage. i love its atmosphere
[0:50:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt bloodborne 2 or new armored core?
[0:50:31] <+campasino> The constant throbbing
[0:50:37] <%Dakuu75> is Pat a glass-cannon or these guys are jsut THAT strong?
[0:50:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god stop being sincere Pat, it's making me feel emotions and I hate it.
[0:50:39] <+razielhex> the aged spice has flown
[0:50:42] <%HefestoForges> almost falling now
[0:50:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> this stage is too bright. Where'd the atmosphere go?
[0:50:45] <lastnamesilverlastname> I guess you could call it OLD SPICE (how many times have people made that joke in this stream?)
[0:50:56] <kingmemelord97> rando question does the ps5 support 4k ?
[0:51:02] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 both
[0:51:06] <smilemychild> @dakuu75 glass cannon, he's taken basically NO vitality and armor SUCKS
[0:51:08] <%RyTYoung> WHAT?
[0:51:09] <lastnamesilverlastname> Reduce brightness for maximum immersion
[0:51:13] <+MoonObscure> even life itself yes
[0:51:17] <rekinom> I can't believe DeS got DMCA'd by old spice
[0:51:20] <%Treuan> But sticky white slime is a coward move
[0:51:22] <+razielhex> they really feel like spider-man
[0:51:23] <Calek> armour doesn't matter in this game anyway
[0:51:25] <%Hasmeister96> Didn't they change "sticky white stuff"?
[0:51:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LOOK AT YOURSELF
[0:51:30] <%a_c_chirns> that sucks, man
[0:51:31] <+Siobhan_deMarisco> too busy crying about my sticky white stuff
[0:51:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOW BACK TO ME
[0:51:34] <%Monkeyweed21> They really FEEL like exxagerated black teens
[0:51:34] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I actually think aged spice sounds cooler.
[0:51:40] <Smugteddy> i do not care for suckh things I will call my spice old good day sir
[0:51:43] <Helmed> theres haptic feedback hitting rock based enemies?
[0:51:45] <%SirGO0SE> Pat you should make a PatDumpTruck emote and copyright it before Jerma
[0:51:46] <RubberFistFight> @Darkfire346 because on a PC, only stuff that's built for HDR (apps, games, video) will work with it, whilst everything made for SDR (wallpaper, non-hdr videos, games, apps) will look washed out. You have to manually toggle it based on content, whereas stuff like game consoles auto-switch as needed.
[0:51:48] <%the22cstomp> do you get haptic feedback for hits on different textures or anything like that?
[0:51:48] <%tusk102> @Hasmeister96 sticky white goo which is somehow worse
[0:51:54] <%Bt_Robot> Do tower guys stay dead?
[0:51:57] <%HefestoForges> did the gargoyle shoot down because it was hit?
[0:52:00] <%the38bandit> John Souls lives here
[0:52:01] <%MelBrooksKA> That'd be a trademark and the idea that Old Spice would even have a case against them is silly
[0:52:01] <Parapattern> I think 'sticky white slime' is way worse
[0:52:11] <lastnamesilverlastname> This is the perfect place for an Ichiban Confectionary Property!
[0:52:12] <L4FACE> I thought Pat despised mages
[0:52:15] <+N0bdyNoOne> Pat where is the babies
[0:52:15] <Krakenoid> this land is kind, its inhabitants friendly
[0:52:18] <+campasino> Only for the badassest of wizards
[0:52:22] <rekinom> The stream definitely looks more vivid, blacks are blacker, colors pop nicely
[0:52:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> This place reminds me of Los Angeles.
[0:52:23] <+NerevaRising> Have you rescued yogurt yet?
[0:52:26] <RyuuAoi> At least you're a pretty strong wizard, Harry.
[0:52:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt max took ten hours here
[0:52:32] <%WhereIsWill> this is the way
[0:52:36] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[0:52:39] <lastnamesilverlastname> Rescued him from HIMSELF
[0:52:40] <+razielhex> Yogurt? Of the Schwarz?
[0:52:41] <redrins> he did
[0:52:42] <GameOver_Here> I legit screamed out loud the first time I hit the bottom floor of this level and had a centipede attack me.
[0:52:43] <Krakenoid> did you rescue him from life pat?
[0:52:45] <DSD24> Rescued him from living
[0:52:45] <Calek> he beat it once in 2015
[0:52:46] <%McSoliace> yup
[0:52:47] <+NerevaRising> Oh no, poor yogurt
[0:52:48] <redrins> I think
[0:52:48] <%Bt_Robot> Rescued from life, maybe
[0:52:48] <%WhereIsWill> like 5 years ago
[0:52:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> this is the way pat
[0:52:51] <+N0bdyNoOne> Liberated him from himself
[0:52:51] <%tusk102> yeah he did
[0:52:52] <%DedlokPM> he did
[0:52:55] <%Daoshinto> Yogurt had a tumble off the tower
[0:52:56] <+lazysaiyajin> didnt play for 4 yeard
[0:52:56] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah but he thinks he one-shotted maneater the first time round
[0:53:03] <Aydarkzero> haven't played Demon's since 2013
[0:53:04] <%patriotrenegade> he blitzed through it in 13 hours in 2015
[0:53:09] <Mirrorcatch> rescued him from this icky mortal coil
[0:53:11] <nastybagl> cumfortable
[0:53:12] <Darkfire346> @RubberFistFight thing is, I tried using HDR for games like RE2/3 and games that have HDR support and it never looks as good as just using RGB.
[0:53:16] <squirtkitten> he was also using a 'wel rounded' build that made a lot of stats equal, so he'd have some magic and then some strength and dex
[0:53:24] <%McSoliace> @Ipsenscastle i was there he did
[0:53:24] <+sermittens> YOGURT! I hate Yogurt! Especially with strawberries
[0:53:27] <%Bt_Robot> Excellent work, @Krakenoid
[0:53:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you played it a bunch AND you did a full let's stream of it
[0:53:31] <%Zeikier> Oppressive?
[0:53:32] <%WhereIsWill> its oppressive af
[0:53:33] <%Zeikier> nailed it
[0:53:36] <+deviljhojho_> he spent like an hour farming in the storm king area so we might do a redux
[0:53:38] <%Dakuu75> intimidating?
[0:53:40] <+razielhex> Spaceballs the Doll: It's Yogurt!
[0:53:41] <RyuuAoi> Pat, you're just good a DS
[0:53:42] <%Ipsenscastle> @McSoliace cool, i didnt actually check back
[0:53:43] <%king_wragles> @sermittens raspberries
[0:53:46] <Parapattern> It's a very stressful level
[0:53:48] <%HefestoForges> that in turn makes you make mistakes
[0:53:52] <%RyTYoung> I only used HDR once and that was for TLOU2 and it made it look really good
[0:53:58] <%Monkeyweed21> it really makes you FEEL like an exaggerated black teen? @PatStaresAt
[0:54:00] <%king_wragles> @sermittens no wait... I think I'M the one who forgot
[0:54:03] <+sermittens> @king_wragles that was raspberry jam
[0:54:14] <%Zeikier> I love how soul arrows have their own unique death animation
[0:54:17] <Blank9> it has a lot of "oh fuck I could fall off" tiny catwalks and enemies on them
[0:54:21] <%Zeikier> instead of Fire hogging all the uniqueness
[0:54:22] <%Bt_Robot> Flying refrigerator monsters and crawling grey boxed
[0:54:28] <%tusk102> @Monkeyweed21 you forgot about the teens swagger
[0:54:28] <%Bt_Robot> *boxes
[0:54:31] <critfumble_> it also takes fucking ages to get around
[0:54:35] <Fefe41> First time going through this level was the most dreadful feeling ever
[0:54:38] <+razielhex> Why is Pat playing as Noob Saibot?
[0:54:39] <%Hasmeister96> Wait weren't we here?
[0:54:42] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I like how demons is chill and doesn't try as hard to kill you as the later games
[0:54:49] <nastybagl> hey pat do you eat ass
[0:54:54] <%Zeikier> this is the second main tower
[0:55:09] <jellssssss20> Does Eli hate or love this one?
[0:55:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eli hates everything.
[0:55:30] <Helmed> it felt like bloodborne for darks souls 3, ya ya
[0:55:38] <$lotharrio> Yeah, I'm seeing that.
[0:55:43] <Aydarkzero> they just vibe
[0:55:49] <Blank9> my favorite thing about demon's souls is the more gimmicky bosses, it's like a puzzle
[0:55:52] <Parapattern> Old AI
[0:56:02] <Aydarkzero> Mind Flayer being a pretty good example
[0:56:04] <$lotharrio> Pat, where is your helmet?
[0:56:06] <%Monkeyweed21> only if you play a mage
[0:56:11] <%half_awake1> half_awake1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months!
[0:56:26] <+campasino> I wish we knew a single gd thing about Elden Ring
[0:56:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait paige streamed last night?
[0:56:28] <Calek> feels more like a dungeon crawler
[0:56:36] <LunarRemix> I don't know, I feel like DS3 is too much action for my taste. It tries too much to be Bloodborne
[0:56:37] <jellssssss20> wrong tower
[0:56:41] <lastnamesilverlastname> I'm not sure I like how crunchy the SFX are tbh
[0:56:42] <%Hasmeister96> Is Paige gonna go through this at some point?
[0:56:43] <+Daedalus119> real easy to get one-shot in demon's souls. Armor is garbage too, so dodging is everything
[0:56:45] <%Zeikier> with more action-y GAME FLAVORS?
[0:56:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh, neat! looking forward to the youtube vod
[0:56:46] <Aydarkzero> i missed it FeelsBadMan
[0:56:47] <Dao_Puppy> If "Fast" is all that mattere then Bayonetta would be the best Souls game.
[0:56:48] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she announced it on her twitter.
[0:56:48] <%Ipsenscastle> Bloodborne has the fast action, but tone-wise it's the closest thing to this I think
[0:56:52] <%Bt_Robot> Pat needs that J U I C E
[0:56:52] <+AXL808> everyone laughed at her, it was a good time
[0:56:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> it certainly looks like it's mechanically tighter than Dark Souls.
[0:56:55] <Meltgar> I remember spending 1k arrows trying to kill the dragon and vanguard cause i was a wee lad footsoldier LUL
[0:56:57] <@SoFarFetched> Twitter is usually the better way to find out streaming schedules.
[0:57:02] <danknugglit> Was progress made last night?
[0:57:03] <%Hasmeister96> @SoFarFetched OK thanks
[0:57:08] <Helmed> demons souls was pretty much just berserk but you didnt have to be guts
[0:57:17] <DSD24> There's Mind Flayers in this game
[0:57:20] <tolloponik> I have the same problems with the late game super monsters in monster hunter they never stop to in order to deal with the clutch claw @PatStaresAt
[0:57:25] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched well i'm SORRY i dont use twitter
[0:57:25] <critfumble_> more pathfinder but yeah kinda
[0:57:25] <+razielhex> 2.5e underdark campaign solo
[0:57:27] <Krakenoid> that. makes a lot of sense actually Pat.
[0:57:36] <+TheCrispyBoi> plague is an old man, he likes things slow
[0:57:39] <huskarl_zap> tbh not enough wordd of death doors to be 2nd edition
[0:57:39] <critfumble_> torchbearer* excuse me
[0:57:39] <+Daedalus119> @Helmed being guts was always the right choice though
[0:57:43] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i pref watching the vods on YT tho
[0:57:43] <Aydarkzero> it's weird but when i first played Demon's i had no interest in DnD but loved Maximo from Ghost to Glory
[0:57:57] <Helmed> Daedalus119 i will never play demons souls without my bone keel sword
[0:58:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is this basically just the underdark from dnd+berserk

[0:58:30] <kingmemelord97> so whats the point of trying to make new demons ?

[0:58:52] <DSD24> What Ho Muscle Wizard! What spell you cast?
[0:58:53] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah twitter's definitely a "not for everyone" but when it comes to like sc hedule changes or sudden "Im planning to stream ---"
[0:58:56] <%Zeikier> Bestttown
[0:59:02] <Tuba_Anon> @tusk102 Needs more spiders to be in the underdark
[0:59:07] <%Zeikier> I CAST FIST

[1:06:51] <+someyounguy1> the scraping spear is the worst thing to ever happen in games. The first time i fought a person who had it they destroyed all my stuff and then started throwing shit at me
[1:06:51] <+shironorii> What kind of build did you with?
[1:06:51] <%hax_metatron> @monkeyweed21 He crazy
[1:06:51] <LunarRemix> Can you only get summoned by people who are near the boss or anyone on the level?
[1:06:52] <DraxTD> ooo tornadow head
[1:06:52] <Joeggernaut777> What if he's afk?
[1:06:57] <studleydoorite> he's afraid of your hat
[1:06:58] <blue8moon> If you are doing this and really don't want to fight another player, just turn off online play
[1:06:58] <+chiazam> Is there nothing you can do about this?
[1:06:59] <DianaTheAscian> or hes lost? @PatStaresAt
[1:07:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they might think you are a real invader and not be entering to not be rude and dc you
[1:07:00] <+ShinyDemonGuy> shouldve left one chair and sat like vergil
[1:07:01] <jellssssss20> Imagine if the boss could leave and chase them down?
[1:07:02] <Animal_Farm4> Can you hear them fighting their way up normally?
[1:07:04] <+waltzqueen> ET ME IN LET ME IIIIIN
[1:07:08] <+AXL808> "I heard a guy breaking furniture in there. I don't want to mess with him"

[1:07:12] <+ThunderZebraKing> That one last chair is triggering me
[1:07:15] <ToneBacas> maybe he's dealing with the mindflayers
[1:07:15] <%Zeikier> lost? the level is a straight line
[1:07:15] <Rabicwill> Pat: The only Souls boss to clean up his own boss room
[1:07:17] <happyfacespam> someyounguy1 rooSmug
[1:07:21] <Ner234> Can you use Photo mode to peek past the door?
[1:07:21] <DianaTheAscian> oh

[1:07:34] <jorniev> WHAT IS THE SCRAPING SPEAR?
[1:07:35] <jellssssss20> Again!
[1:07:35] <Helmed> the original patches RP was some big nose dude and a scraping spear. good times....
[1:07:36] <%tusk102> smh
[1:07:36] <+CannonHeroBrett> That was lame
[1:07:37] <happyfacespam> John Souls moon2H
[1:07:38] <Meltgar> COWARDS DIE IN SHAME
[1:07:40] <%RedPanda25> he might've thought you invaded somewhere else in the llevel
[1:07:40] <Sain_127> HI PAT
[1:07:42] <Fefe41> host: ez 1v1
[1:07:43] <+Daedalus119> I've had a lot of hosts die just trying to get to the boss room
[1:07:43] <+CapnClassix> Will you try again?
[1:07:44] <jorniev> i never saw it
[1:07:45] <Dao_Puppy> I want an item that sends the "invader has left" message.
[1:07:47] <%Zeikier> a spear what scrapes
[1:07:50] <DianaTheAscian> is the ai old monk hard?
[1:07:56] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Do you still lose a level if you warp out of the Old Monk? or is that only for regular invasions?
[1:07:58] <+Daedalus119> IIRC there's a couple black phantoms or somethin leading up to the boss stairs
[1:07:58] <Brofarian> Doesn't your world tendency go down when you leave pvp early?
[1:08:10] <DSD24> Doesn't he use claws?
[1:08:13] <%OperatorJo_> psaWhat
[1:08:20] <Aydarkzero> it's not his world afterall
[1:08:21] <happyfacespam> for those unaware the Scraping Spear is a spear that drains durability of ALL gear by 10 per hit, regardless if you have the requirements to wield it
[1:08:25] <tolloponik> like taking lunch money
[1:08:33] <paltar4> This game look really good
[1:08:34] <+Henwryyy> Hello pat
[1:08:36] <+Kingtut9009> You lose a level if you die to environment as a black phantom tho
[1:08:37] <+Ir0nAgr0> I got a invader who went afk
[1:08:41] <%Zeikier> does this game glitch out world tendency to the server average or nah?
[1:08:41] <%Monkeyweed21> pat desires his PURE WHITE world
[1:08:46] <gronzen> Woo, hour late
[1:08:49] <%HefestoForges> disconnecting is the "easy mode is now selectable" of this boss then?
[1:08:49] <Deadmanslegacy> Is the pvp in this as "balanced" as ds3s?
[1:09:03] <%Zeikier> hell yeah
[1:09:08] <%tusk102> HELL NO
[1:09:13] <Deadmanslegacy> oh joy
[1:09:16] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[1:09:18] <Animal_Farm4> pvp in all the souls games is a joke to be fair LUL
[1:09:22] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Balance is overrated.
[1:09:23] <%McSoliace> balance isn't fun
[1:09:24] <%hax_metatron> psaCrazy Your WT does go down if you leave an invasion LUL
[1:09:24] <%AzureGale> Does the Scraping Spear still exist
[1:09:25] <%TheWinged7> scraping spear = you win
[1:09:29] <tolloponik> even bigger EvilLaughter
[1:09:30] <+ALazo> time to scrape
[1:09:35] <+blacksoap65> @PATSTARESat did you get the colorless from sparky?
[1:09:36] <%OperatorJo_> pvp working as intended
[1:09:37] <%tusk102> Pvp is super fun because it's unbalanced as fuck @Deadmanslegacy
[1:09:39] <linSP> Ds2 pvp is BEST
[1:09:40] <+brightman42> thought they were still going to have white/black world tendency server events tho
[1:09:42] <tolloponik> storm ruler = fun
[1:09:42] <jorniev> THEY PATCHED THE COIN GLITCH IM SAD
[1:09:46] <+AXL808> Minmo!
[1:09:47] <Vashido22> @patstaresat so is this probably the easiest souls game?
[1:09:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> Help Pat. I grinded enough to play Mahjong and now I'm stuck in a save scummin' loop to make money in Y7
[1:09:51] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Animal_Farm4 They did okay with 2.
[1:09:57] <paltar4> Pat is a whizzard
[1:09:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The weak should fear the strong.
[1:10:02] <+Daedalus119> see scraping spear = instaleave. Classic demon's souls multiplayer
[1:10:02] <jorniev> THEY DIDNT
[1:10:03] <RetroCop87> are you enjoying 13 Sentinels so far? Just beat it, and it's easily my game narrative of the year
[1:10:03] <jellssssss20> No they didn't it still works
[1:10:03] <jorniev> _
[1:10:05] <jorniev> ?
[1:10:17] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Imagine complaining these games aren't balanced as if they're supposed to be competitive ranked PvP games.
[1:10:25] <RyuuAoi> One Guy
[1:10:27] <%hax_metatron> They released two patches and still didn‚Äôt fix the coin glitch LIL
[1:10:40] <Vashido22> No waaaay
[1:10:41] <%McSoliace> duh
[1:10:43] <+chiazam> Why?
[1:10:45] <super_robo_mg> unfair for who?
[1:10:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I know
[1:10:48] <Helmed> surprised theyre patching it. demons souls used to give you a screen saying "exploit the game to win" before you played
[1:10:48] <gronzen> ...Why?
[1:10:49] <+waltzqueen> sounds legit
[1:10:49] <ScreamLord> For who?
[1:10:49] <Deadmanslegacy> sounds about right
[1:10:50] <DSD24> Gank Squad
[1:10:53] <$lotharrio> Purposefully unfair sounds a lot like purposefully unfun.
[1:10:54] <DianaTheAscian> makes sense
[1:10:59] <Meltgar> Wow can't wait to have "fun" Kappa
[1:11:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @gronzen To induce panic and stress.
[1:11:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That sounds really unfun
[1:11:03] <ScreamLord> Unfair how?
[1:11:07] <jorniev> I GOT mY ass tamborined in demons souls pvp
[1:11:07] <+Henwryyy> Have you had any issues with the ps5?
[1:11:09] <+someyounguy1> they couldnt make the fact that you can vault up ledges more invisible
[1:11:09] <andimustmask> alas, now people cry if someone manages to beat their 4man ganksquad + police reinforcements
[1:11:10] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt which game can't invaders heal
[1:11:11] <%Bt_Robot> It's a demon coming into your world to steal your souls
[1:11:12] <linSP> what‚Äôs the punishment for cutting the connection
[1:11:14] <tolloponik> chain backstabbing in DrS 1 was so fun
[1:11:20] <+brightman42> if you run with a body you should also have a buddy or two
[1:11:20] <Ser_Randal> World hosts must have their nuts smashed
[1:11:21] <Vashido22> @patstaresat is this probably the easiest souls game?
[1:11:23] <%EmptyPenguin> EmptyPenguin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months lets gooo!
[1:11:25] <%hax_metatron> People said IM BABY THIS IS HARD
[1:11:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Demon's Souls/Dark Souls 1 are about never feeling safe.
[1:11:34] <tolloponik> @linSP none
[1:11:35] <jorniev> YEEE berserk land
[1:11:41] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I've only been invaded once so far in the remake anyway though.
[1:11:43] <%McSoliace> yup
[1:11:44] <chambatron> Mama didn't raise no bitch
[1:11:45] <Aydarkzero> you can also make builds really fast in DeS
[1:11:46] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did u scrapping spear people back in the day Pat?
[1:11:48] <+FackinCrazy> currently doing my first regeneration run and ohhhh boy its over powered
[1:11:51] <jorniev> i love this horror realm
[1:11:51] <%AzureGale> Bleh
[1:11:53] <Vashido22> oh this is hella berserk
[1:11:54] <ScreamLord> Look at that big ol' Berserk
[1:11:55] <Sain_127> sorry that was me...
[1:11:58] <+AXL808> plip, plop, plip, plop
[1:12:00] <jorniev> WOOOOOOAH
[1:12:03] <+NerevaRising> Its the hardest if you go in blind with no souls experience
[1:12:07] <jorniev> THOSE GUYS LOOKS AWESOME NOW
[1:12:09] <lastnamesilverlastname> Scrape their Spear
[1:12:12] <Vashido22> LOOK AT THIS BERSERK LOOKIN PLACE
[1:12:15] <paltar4> Yummy sausage tubes
[1:12:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt regenerator builds still stupid good?
[1:12:19] <tolloponik> @PatStaresAt storm ruler then?
[1:12:20] <devanmuse> Pat may be an honorless goblin, but he's not a MONSTER
[1:12:21] <Deadmanslegacy> ds3 is the only one where I have extensive pvp experience, just now started trying DsR.
[1:12:22] <SPidERMan8576> Whens the griffen fight?
[1:12:25] <RyuuAoi> Souls barely even teaches you how to play the game.
[1:12:27] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Pat stomped them like babies.
[1:12:32] <gronzen> Oh my fucking god these things baby cry what the fuck
[1:12:34] <Aydarkzero> regen build is all me
[1:12:34] <DSD24> Same code too
[1:12:35] <tolloponik> Soul Brand killing?
[1:12:37] <%hax_metatron> Fun fact: this place was always awesome, even in the original.
[1:12:38] <%tusk102> fuck yes
[1:12:41] <jorniev> I LOOVE THESE FREAKAZOIS
[1:12:47] <+waltzqueen> same as it ever was
[1:12:48] <%Bt_Robot> New build, same as the old build
[1:12:54] <%McSoliace> pulling out scraping spear as a defense to invasions is the shit
[1:13:06] <+chiazam> That's fucked up Pat
[1:13:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ds2 was the first game that said "fuck it the greatsword is the dragon slayer" right?
[1:13:10] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[1:13:19] <squirtkitten> and theres people like VaatiVidya who wanted all that removed and turned into DS3 LUL
[1:13:23] <Mangahero18> basically evil
[1:13:34] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @McSoliace Oh that's a brilliant idea actually.
[1:13:36] <Jack8274> We all go through the no honor phase
[1:13:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Didn't woolie get scraping speared in the DS stream?
[1:14:01] <jorniev> DO YOU REMEMBER the hall of fame on top of the nexus?
[1:14:01] <%Bt_Robot> is cage a shortcut?
[1:14:07] <+GovernmentMY> the last of us 2 is so good
[1:14:08] <%tusk102> @MelBrooksKA no, they tried to scraping spear and he jumped off a cliff i think
[1:14:12] <jorniev> just a room full of all the cheaters
[1:14:20] <+brightman42> this upcoming lizard gave me pstd
[1:14:23] <Deadmanslegacy> so far in ds1 the zweighs my goto for...everything.
[1:14:24] <Jack8274> It‚Äôs a easy af run tho
[1:14:25] <+MoonObscure> lol
[1:14:26] <%McSoliace> @VvTacoSaladvV using scraping spear as a mental shield is always funny as hell
[1:14:28] <%AzureGale> I remember that
[1:14:33] <Matrixvingian> Does Pat's undead knight look like him?
[1:14:33] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it broke the falchion right?
[1:14:34] <RubberFistFight> that spear busts all your shit wide open
[1:14:36] <+MoonObscure> BOOP!
[1:14:36] <Aydarkzero> it's usually not worth fighting haha

[1:15:01] <Aydarkzero> sniped!
[1:15:02] <Sain_127> i could really get into ds series pvp....but i never memorized any of the environmental kill set ups
[1:15:03] <Jathspuh> @andimustmask that wasn't an invasion
[1:15:06] <sychevatel> literally one hit kill
[1:15:07] <%hax_metatron> That‚Äôs a shot all the way from Bloodborne LUL
[1:15:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do you have the magic dullness ring
[1:15:10] <jorniev> PEW PEW
[1:15:13] <andimustmask> ahh, my b
[1:15:23] <mr_slaide> I blame Woolie.
[1:15:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> We'll knock it out over the Fall guys.
[1:15:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why is Scraping Spear so terrible to fight against? I'm not familiar with Demon's Souls.
[1:15:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> hey pat did you see that monsterbhunter world is collabing with the monster hunter movie
[1:15:35] <Aydarkzero> doesn't that ring also decrease your magic?
[1:15:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Too_Much_Nukie It causes weapon/armor durability damage.
[1:15:50] <squirtkitten> man i hope they never patch that gold coin mechanic just leave it in for boss one shot funsies
[1:15:52] <andimustmask> @Too_Much_Nukie breaks your equipment
[1:15:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Too_Much_Nukie it is a weapon meant to destroy equipment
[1:15:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Too_Much_Nukie Literally breaks your gear.
[1:15:57] <Blank9> do you have the stuff for second chance to be a real jerk?
[1:16:01] <watts121> Everytime you are hit with the Scraping Spear you lose hella durability
[1:16:04] <%LaughingCatt> why hate Constipation man
[1:16:06] <DSD24> Pat you don't like Rydell going HRRRRGH
[1:16:09] <Otatoptohami> i thought rydell gives dull rat's ring?
[1:16:09] <Blank9> PLEASE, HELP ME
[1:16:10] <+brightman42> I straight up forget his deal
[1:16:10] <+godila2> new mhw quest is monster hunter movie one NotLikeThis
[1:16:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That sure sounds toxic as hell.
[1:16:11] <RetroCop87> so did the castle come with all this fucked up architecture, or did the demons redesign it?
[1:16:14] <Aydarkzero> but it was funny
[1:16:14] <time2getsweaty> lookin quite comfy today pat : D
[1:16:19] <Jathspuh> constipation's tight
[1:16:23] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Can't wait to see Woolie coach Reggie through this, thus passing the torch.
[1:16:24] <RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie because it basically goes "That's really nice gear you've got, it'd be a shame if someone fed it through a shredder."
[1:16:31] <Deadmanslegacy> farming spot confirmed
[1:16:32] <CappuccinoGuil> They 100% drop those soul items
[1:16:37] <time2getsweaty> thats a compliment, not a insult i promise :D
[1:16:38] <%T_Sasquatch> Haha Paige Go MustardddSkelepatelmozangieff
[1:16:40] <DSD24> Feeling comfy is nice
[1:16:45] <%Monkeyweed21> are you cumfy
[1:16:45] <Helmed> theyre not worth much
[1:16:46] <%McSoliace> who cares comfy is comfy
[1:16:47] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt Just wondering are u gonna touch MH stories2 when it comes out?
[1:16:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Can you repair equipment in this game though?
[1:16:55] <%tusk102> @Too_Much_Nukie you don't need the stats to activate the effect so people would use it totally unupgraded and barely hurt you, but hit you like 30 times and break every piece of gear you wearing
[1:16:59] <%josstil> josstyl_0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! I can't find the clip where Sakurai tells the filthy wifi casuals to get the ethernet adapter. Which Direct was it in?
[1:16:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Cumfy
[1:17:01] <+gyabs> you get unknown hero soul sometimes
[1:17:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @Too_Much_Nukie yes, but it gets costly
[1:17:08] <Ner234> LOL Holy shit Monster World is doing a collab with the Mosnter Hunter movie LUL. wtf
[1:17:13] <tolloponik> @Too_Much_Nukie it destroys all your armor durability condition and there was no auto repair function bonfires had
[1:17:15] <Aydarkzero> ye
[1:17:17] <+Mitchellsocks> I swear Rydell and Urbain have the same face in the OG loading screen portraita
[1:17:20] <+chiazam> how in the fu-
[1:17:28] <chambatron> MEirl
[1:17:28] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[1:17:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> one of the last 2 directs i think
[1:17:33] <Aydarkzero> they just forget LUL
[1:17:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ner234 truely this is a monster hunter world...
[1:17:40] <Rabicwill> forget they have wings
[1:17:40] <bettysharkface> Stone no fly good
[1:17:40] <lastnamesilverlastname> Oh please give us a Manater kill with fall damage!
[1:17:41] <Fefe41> Maneater can also fly indefinitely which is extra stupider
[1:17:45] <CappuccinoGuil> It's probably a state bug where they think they are above ground and stop flying
[1:17:46] <+Mitchellsocks> I guess Maneater gets caught in an animation and hits a kill plane?
[1:17:46] <%T_Sasquatch> psaDab sipsipDab FUSIONNNN HAAAA
[1:17:48] <squirtkitten> How tho? Everytime Max had him slip off he'd start flying and go into the charge
[1:17:54] <%Bt_Robot> Speedrunners use AI manips in this stage
[1:17:58] <%josstil> was it steve or min-min?
[1:18:04] <RyuuAoi> Pat, the PS5 need a bigger hard drive? Yeah?
[1:18:18] <Meltgar> What has been killing pat? Prisoner horde or mind flayer?
[1:18:21] <+N0bdyNoOne> My head cannon is he is trying to go full black for the demon
[1:18:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> DAMMIT
[1:18:27] <Sain_127> ohh yeah i gotta watch a speedrun of this
[1:18:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was so ready for him to walk off the edge.

[1:18:34] <Rabicwill> Jeeeeeesus Pat
[1:18:41] <DianaTheAscian> u gave small panic attack
[1:18:42] <Aydarkzero> @RyuuAoi gotta wai for Sony to allow to upgrade unfortunately
[1:18:43] <jorniev> PATNOISE
[1:18:46] <+Mitchellsocks> That fall woulda been lethal in DS2
[1:18:46] <%WhereIsWill> @PatStaresAt will we ever see a return of the "hat in time" pat alert??
[1:18:46] <DianaTheAscian> me*
[1:18:47] <%tusk102> @Meltgar flayer
[1:18:48] <bettysharkface> Wee

[1:18:58] <%Monkeyweed21> the other cages put you next to the stairs
[1:19:00] <%AncelDeLambert> Hey, we're playing Bloodborne
[1:19:05] <%hax_metatron> The remake‚Äôs any% speedrun is currently 12 minutes @patstaresat
[1:19:07] <%AncelDeLambert> watch out for crows
[1:19:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh goody, Blighttown
[1:19:19] <+Mitchellsocks> Don't want to think about the Mergo's Loft Middle elevator
[1:19:22] <+taltalheights> I'm late, is Yurt alive or dead?
[1:19:23] <redrins> nah it has wrong warping
[1:19:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WhereIsWill I don't know man but if you want a link to it for yourself I'll link you
[1:19:27] <%T_Sasquatch> EZ game
[1:19:32] <%AncelDeLambert> literally JUST Blighttown
[1:19:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Mitchellsocks RIGHT!?
[1:19:33] <Deadmanslegacy> anyone had any major problems with they're ps5 yet?
[1:19:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOW?
[1:19:35] <%Willbo_Baggins> @taltalheights dead
[1:19:37] <redrins> you literally teleport into boss rooms in the speedrun
[1:19:38] <Aydarkzero> Yurt ded
[1:19:38] <%tusk102> @taltalheights dead as a doornail
[1:19:39] <%AzureGale> Squishy squishy
[1:19:40] <Meltgar> @taltalheights He tripped Kappa
[1:19:40] <DSD24> @taltalheights He's hyper dead
[1:19:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No. We will continue to make the noises.
[1:19:48] <%Garthunox> whats the any% no glitch run tho?
[1:19:48] <%hax_metatron> There are some new glitches @patstaresat You can walk in the air
[1:19:58] <%AzureGale> Bleeeeeeeeh
[1:20:02] <%Monkeyweed21> wrong way
[1:20:03] <%AncelDeLambert> damn, From Soft really has just been remaking the exact same game for a decade
[1:20:07] <%WhereIsWill> @doc_ock_rokc what?! that'd be so dope if ya could
[1:20:09] <+Mitchellsocks> My favorite part in the run is that the same fire that kills you to put you into Phalanx also puts your into bugged out Allant
[1:20:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't like any of these noises these enemies are making.
[1:20:09] <Deadmanslegacy> well dex certainly seems viable
[1:20:11] <very_ap3> what is the sword were using?
[1:20:16] <%AncelDeLambert> "Now do it again, but properly this time!"
[1:20:18] <+taltalheights> Thanks all
[1:20:23] <+chiazam> @taltalheights Who's Yurt?
[1:20:33] <%tusk102> @Deadmanslegacy p much everything is viable

[1:20:41] <+Bruzur> @patstaresat super psyched, walked into a Target in Dallas today, got a PS5. Demon‚Äôs Souls time.
[1:20:43] <%Garthunox> is*
[1:20:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Didn't Pat say it was impossible to get lost in this level about 10 minutes ago?
[1:20:47] <%Bt_Robot> There is a cage on your right that is a shortcut
[1:20:48] <%AncelDeLambert> at least the sound mixing on the magic is solid
[1:20:48] <+N0bdyNoOne> You could say, that you got flip turned upside down?
[1:20:49] <Rabicwill> one of the most unsettling enemies From Soft have ever made
[1:20:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @chiazam an NPC you find here. He's Lautrec, but worse. He'll teleport to the Nexus and kill EVERY NPC there
[1:20:52] <%Laecerelius> Yurt super dead
[1:20:53] <Deadmanslegacy> @anceldelambert fromsoft didn't make this remake
[1:20:53] <CandyCoatedConfection> is that what paige and woolie feel like ü§î
[1:20:53] <%Zeikier> the souls series is just From's way of fitting in all the crap from previous games they left on the cutting room floor
[1:20:54] <%Bt_Robot> NVM
[1:20:55] <%josstil> It was the Steve Direct. Thanks Tomatoes

[1:32:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> ye ye ye
[1:32:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fists of God are OP in DS3
[1:32:16] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Huh, 2 years.Anyways, here's my $5 shitposting fee.Also, I picked up the whole witcher series for $15 and felt obligated to play through 1. Its a weird, janky RPG that had a good story but gameplay that was 'jank'. 2 is much improved except for bosses.
[1:32:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> It looks like my cooking!
[1:32:17] <Meltgar> MEAT
[1:32:20] <Joeggernaut777> That made me aware of my own beating heart
[1:32:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> "We've gotta lock up the heart Sora!"
[1:32:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Just remember that you have one of those inside of you @PatStaresAt
[1:32:31] <RubberFistFight> You never needed the magic horrors, Dumbo, the cardiac ticks were inside you the WHOLE TIME!
[1:32:43] <AC_Rancor> I love how this game had cutscenes that foreshadowed boss encounters and stuff. So cool.
[1:32:46] <RyuuAoi> Fuck spiders, man
[1:32:49] <GoogleyGareth> woof
[1:32:59] <%wydamn> It baffles me that anyone complains about the way DeS Remake looks. This looks better than DS3 with visual mods.
[1:33:00] <DianaTheAscian> it weird knowing what in berserk that thing is referencing
[1:33:00] <%josstil> these designs are amazing
[1:33:07] <DianaTheAscian> its*

[1:33:28] <%Aeogard> i just got some wendy's what did i miss
[1:33:30] <%walternatorz> you're a big circle.
[1:33:31] <Aydarkzero> good level design makes me go poggers
[1:33:32] <%WhereIsWill> map design PogChamp
[1:33:34] <watts121> This is nice to watch. I'm farming money in Yakuza 7 right now cuz weapons cost Millions to upgrade now. So I'm just holding the trigger while watching this on my 2nd monitor.
[1:33:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> "Wait, this was just a shortcut back to the start"
[1:33:40] <ishouldbeatworklol> did the game change at all like the plot or anything
[1:33:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> "Always has been"
[1:33:48] <+tigerfang86> Spooky
[1:33:48] <kingmemelord97> the piss moon

[1:34:12] <Blank9> that's agamecube blue moon
[1:34:14] <%josstil> Is the yellow monk related to the yellow king?

[1:34:17] <%KaiserMario> Pat, the item

[1:34:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> spooders
[1:34:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you forget about the secret drop down item?
[1:35:01] <%Aeogard> I wonder if this has a Persona 5 reference in it somewhere
[1:35:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt cling ring back on
[1:35:05] <Morbidmort> For he wears no Masque
[1:35:21] <blue8moon> but it's not shit
[1:35:22] <$linkthoy> @wydamn most of the complaints I've seen are about certain designs, not the graphical fidelity.
[1:35:23] <%Zeikier> these can be pus piles
[1:35:33] <Fefe41> Can't decide which place is worse to live in, bottom of 3-2 or 5-2
[1:35:37] <%Zeikier> pus can have little a shit

[1:36:45] <+rocko_125> i most watch pat on youtube
[1:36:51] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt in terms of lore would the DS1 bosses be stronger than Demon Souls?
[1:36:52] <%Aeogard> I'd wait for a sale on DS2, maybe 15-20
[1:36:52] <Calek> fire damage that scales with magic no doubt
[1:36:55] <kingmemelord97> wait if the hear is dead why is the boss still alive
[1:37:01] <%StrifeZubia> @Mangahero18 it is, but you know everything in creation is going on sale in like three days
[1:37:02] <+grumbleroar> So it was a pi√±ata

[1:37:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Try fist but hole
[1:37:35] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> DS stuff is all old and past it's prime, kind of it's point.
[1:37:36] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> heeey patty cakes
[1:37:39] <+waltzqueen> GOATSE
[1:37:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Try fist but whole
[1:37:42] <studleydoorite> where does Sandipede rank in this power scale?
[1:37:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> They're not gods, they just have lots of power
[1:37:44] <Calek> imo the old gold mask was better
[1:37:45] <kingmemelord97> boooo
[1:37:46] <Meltgar> Demon souls grunts feel weaker than DS grunts, but the BOSSES you are right
[1:37:48] <%josstil> only lady
[1:37:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Snazzy
[1:37:49] <%Bt_Robot> PARDONER?
[1:37:49] <%hax_metatron> Nah DS1 has the best world in total though. Everything is clockwork and it‚Äôs unique in the series
[1:37:50] <%Zeikier> Mephistopheles wears that mask!
[1:37:50] <Saltmeisterr> E PEE
[1:37:51] <tolloponik> AHHH, WEAK
[1:37:51] <blue8moon> Gwyn is a legit god, whereas dragon god is just worshipped as a god
[1:37:52] <%superc37> the masj that got fucking BUTCHERED by the remake
[1:37:53] <+waltzqueen> BOO
[1:37:54] <chambatron> Rapier gonna rapi

[1:37:56] <%AzureGale> They still have gender-restriced gear? Man
[1:37:59] <%Noogiez> yo
[1:37:59] <RyuuAoi> No SEX
[1:38:01] <Mangahero18> you mean 'Only for Type B' right?
[1:38:02] <%tusk102> would peak gwyn trounce like 70% the bosses here @PatStaresAt
[1:38:03] <Maids4lyfe> e-peen rapier
[1:38:04] <huskarl_zap> Aren't gods just a race though?
[1:38:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can change your gender at the Nexus Statue if you wanna wear female clothing
[1:38:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Gotta love that Bluepoint removed "Female" and "Male" body to be inclusive, but kept gendered clothing LUL
[1:38:12] <%Zeikier> yeah, these are godlike beings rather than actual gods
[1:38:13] <CappuccinoGuil> a hit and a miss
[1:38:21] <RetroCop87> the eyore raper
[1:38:27] <Aydarkzero> for sure
[1:38:30] <%Zeikier> kinda interesting how mortal the beasties in this game are
[1:38:34] <NocturneNovember> So did anyone watch see the MHW x Monster Hunter movie crossover coming to the game?
[1:38:37] <%Noogiez> hey, to whoever gave me a sub thanks man
[1:38:38] <ravioli_ronin> Peepee rapier
[1:38:38] <Calek> they hit the ball but it was a foul
[1:38:38] <Meltgar> @AzureGale Yeah, i think same happened to the executioner set
[1:38:39] <Aydarkzero> i always go for the Dul set
[1:38:42] <%hax_metatron> Everyone can be into BDSM
[1:38:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @retrocop87 um...
[1:38:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Theif Ring is for cowards that don't wanna fight ULL
[1:38:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[1:38:51] <kingmemelord97> @NocturneNovember no it any good ?
[1:39:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'd rather not use the thief ring and have a better ring to help me in the actual fights that I'm gonna have to get into
[1:39:11] <%hax_metatron> The true Demon‚Äôs Souls starts here (the upcoming staircase)
[1:39:14] <RetroCop87> @cobalt_phoenix_ TPFufun
[1:39:16] <Aydarkzero> thankfully the secret armor can be worn by both
[1:39:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> is this lovecraftian place?
[1:39:23] <Robotoman> psaGiefrail
[1:39:28] <%mgs09> mgs09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[1:39:28] <Mangahero18> It really feels like a sort of half-assed attempt at inclusion and political correctness on Bluepoints part. I applaud the attempt if not the execution.
[1:39:30] <RyuuAoi> When's Diablo?
[1:39:35] <%Aeogard> the stairs harder than the boss LUK
[1:39:35] <Calek> Dull Gold Armour looks rad in this game though
[1:39:36] <kingmemelord97> ah yes the worst demon of them all stairs
[1:39:39] <%Aeogard> LUL
[1:39:44] <%AFlyingTaco1> The Penetrator armor looks so fucking sick, goddamn
[1:39:47] <+Betofall> I hated this staircase in particular
[1:39:49] <NocturneNovember> @kingmemelord97 Eh. Milla Jovovich shows up
[1:39:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thought you were keeping it on as default. Nevermind, I forgot what was situational about this area
[1:39:54] <Fefe41> Time for the flayer that has killed billions
[1:39:58] <%Zeikier> bowling with a single gutter
[1:40:00] <%josstil> hello
[1:40:01] <Ner234> These stairs are not osha approved
[1:40:02] <%WhereIsWill> this is where it gets real
[1:40:02] <huskarl_zap> I think plague made a days worth videos on darksouls and concluded gods were just a race other than humans witches and undead
[1:40:04] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Man, fuck this dude!
[1:40:05] <Dao_Puppy> Can you headbutt this guy off?
[1:40:07] <+grumbleroar> Not just stealth...THE Stealth
[1:40:10] <%Aeogard> that one flayer is so awful to get past usually
[1:40:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh right, so the mind flayers don't attack as soon
[1:40:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Couldn't you just get him with a bow
[1:40:19] <%walternatorz> mm spice
[1:40:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Really?
[1:40:21] <kingmemelord97> mmm spice
[1:40:21] <%hax_metatron> This is the staircase that basically tells you whether these games are for you!!!!!
[1:40:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Doesn't go away either like Human Phantoms
[1:40:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> You seemed to have no trouble
[1:40:26] <RyuuAoi> And he gone
[1:40:28] <huskarl_zap> return to pygme
[1:40:32] <kingmemelord97> @walternatorz ayyy
[1:40:33] <%tusk102> @Mangahero18 bro... it's literally only one armor set that got ungendered. all the rest are still gendered
[1:40:35] <ShichiNoBushi> "This is the most dangerous enemy." *two-shots him*
[1:40:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Deleted
[1:40:38] <Mangahero18> Red Phantom squidhead? Why squidward why?
[1:40:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> @ShichiNoBushi LUL
[1:40:56] <%hax_metatron> The staircase is Dormammu and you can only beat it like Pat did if you played it 1000000 times
[1:41:00] <%Aeogard> magic will kill everything in 2 hits LUL
[1:41:02] <+santafer> Man. I really want a PS5 but at this rate I will get the Corona vaccine before I can grab one...
[1:41:03] <%josstil> true
[1:41:06] <blue8moon> these games look easy when someone who knows what they're doing plays them
[1:41:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yup
[1:41:09] <devanmuse> So what's so fucky about the tower interior?
[1:41:10] <+grumbleroar> Right tool for the job
[1:41:16] <Profmcstevie> Wandering mind flayer on a precarious staircase who doesn't stagger easily
[1:41:19] <%AFlyingTaco1> Ya'll don't know if you think that guy was simple. That motherfucker has killed millions of players throughout the years.
[1:41:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> These games are about cheesing everything you can
[1:41:22] <+taltalheights> Sad they removed Maneater arrow glitch
[1:41:28] <@commanderclaw> That's one of the things people liked about this game, it rewarded player knowledge more like an old school game
[1:41:31] <%captain_thickthighs> I subscribed with prime I dunno if it helps but eh
[1:41:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> why is that sad?
[1:41:35] <%Aeogard> DeS is super easy if you know anything about the game/levels
[1:41:42] <Aydarkzero> ah yes the old bridge battle
[1:41:43] <%Aeogard> LUL
[1:41:44] <%Zeikier> yeah, cuz of how small the damn arena is
[1:41:44] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god there's nowhere to GO
[1:41:46] <%WhereIsWill> burn em down quick!
[1:41:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @santafer not if they cancel warpspeed like biden's advisor wants
[1:41:47] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK
[1:41:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[1:41:51] <RubberFistFight> This is the boss that took viagra and put on a cock ring before showing up to boss work that day.
[1:41:51] <coffeebearCafe> is this pats first try?
[1:41:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> The two-on-one boss?
[1:41:57] <%tusk102> @SirKeigan cuz it was funny
[1:41:58] <%AncelDeLambert> at least Taurus gave you a plunging attack!
[1:41:59] <+waltzqueen> OOF
[1:41:59] <lastnamesilverlastname> Just don't get hit 4head
[1:41:59] <%captain_thickthighs> this is what I imagine plague looks like in the flesh
[1:42:00] <Morbidmort> It's a Manticore!
[1:42:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Looks good tho
[1:42:01] <kingmemelord97> its just a maticore ?
[1:42:02] <+Bruzur> And also the laziest AI ever...
[1:42:02] <%Aeogard> dont fall off :)
[1:42:04] <Mangahero18> The souls series is one that ultimately rewards preparation and patience more than skill.
[1:42:05] <thelonechris> Watch out boys, she'll chew you up
[1:42:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Robert!?
[1:42:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a bat thing
[1:42:11] <huskarl_zap> close
[1:42:11] <Ner234> That charge still makes me jump
[1:42:11] <%AncelDeLambert> no, it looks FUCKING HARD
[1:42:12] <+SickBangerzM9> oh my god what happened to its face?
[1:42:14] <%AzureGale> Is there a phase 2
[1:42:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least you stagger him a bit
[1:42:17] <%AFlyingTaco1> That's some good magic damage tho
[1:42:19] <+applefibs> it's man-bat
[1:42:20] <+Jaysky> It's getting knocked off
[1:42:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> This actually is hard
[1:42:23] <%AncelDeLambert> ow
[1:42:24] <%AFlyingTaco1> Even out the playing field a bit
[1:42:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Stupid ledges

[1:42:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Monster in tight space?
[1:42:28] <WakeUpThrow> Wow, the maneater looks weird in this
[1:42:29] <%Laecerelius> OTG!!

[1:42:35] <SomeAsianDood> Looks pretty hard to me KEKW
[1:42:35] <+applefibs> dying to prove a point
[1:42:35] <ShichiNoBushi> The narrow arena with death drops on the sides makes it look pretty dangerous.

[1:42:38] <%ssjklyco> Man, he ate you
[1:42:38] <Fefe41> That was a decent first attempt after so many years lol
[1:42:39] <%Zeikier> shit can just go wrong out of nowhere which is why this fight sucks
[1:42:39] <Brofarian> You look stressed Pat, maybe you should say the gamer word, just to let out some of that pent up anger.
[1:42:40] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt And they know Maneater was hard as balls. That's why they made them one of the first bosses in DS1 to scare the shit outta DeS vets
[1:42:41] <Aydarkzero> that aint Falco!
[1:42:42] <%WhereIsWill> watch out now, theyll chew you up
[1:42:42] <rufus2k2> come on

[1:42:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you gonna finish that sentence?
[1:42:49] <Profmcstevie> All up to the will of the boss if you die in one :)
[1:42:50] <+sermittens> DS3 movement it would be a lot easier
[1:42:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are you using thief ring so maneater loses track of you and flies around like a moron
[1:42:51] <JetpackMcQuack> ITS NO USE
[1:42:51] <+chiazam> that's rad
[1:42:51] <Mangahero18> lol
[1:42:53] <huskarl_zap> dont hurt me no more starts playing
[1:42:54] <%fritz_dacat> dam cant escape
[1:42:55] <+santafer> The sound design makes everything "heavy"
[1:42:56] <%TinyLittleDancer> Just mauled you on the ground
[1:42:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt What do you have the brightness level on?
[1:42:57] <Aydarkzero> ah good times
[1:42:57] <+Jaysky> POMF cirOwO cirOwO
[1:42:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> I did
[1:42:58] <%SaiyanShoto> It felt good hitting his stupid face with a dragon bone smasher
[1:42:58] <%josstil> yupp
[1:42:58] <+MoonObscure> hmm
[1:42:59] <%Zeikier> you're basically fighting this boss in a single-person-wide hallway you can fall off of
[1:43:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> yus
[1:43:02] <%RyTYoung> ye
[1:43:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> i mean never heard of it
[1:43:07] <+chiazam> No
[1:43:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nope
[1:43:09] <j_dam_z> nope
[1:43:10] <Mangahero18> Most of it yea
[1:43:10] <%TinyLittleDancer> That and the second one is not a welcome surprise
[1:43:10] <very_ap3> I didnt :)
[1:43:12] <RubberFistFight> beat the PtD edition on the PS3
[1:43:13] <+CookieCutter007> DS2 the best one
[1:43:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[1:43:15] <SirItGoBoomAlot> I remember, I only got one character past him back in the day, and half the fight he glitched out
[1:43:16] <thelonechris> I dropped off at Tower Knight
[1:43:17] <%DeaconBluesClues> yes
[1:43:19] <%Zeikier> Taco Bell Gargoyle
[1:43:19] <Helmed> ive never beaten that boss without abusing the line of sight with the fire in the middle. its such bullshit NotLikeThis
[1:43:21] <j_dam_z> bb only
[1:43:22] <Morbidmort> @SickBangerzM9 A manticore has the head and body of a Lion, the face of a Man, the wings of a Bat, and the tail of a scorpion
[1:43:26] <%AFlyingTaco1> People don't know. But you gotta know.
[1:43:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Taurus is the first dude
[1:43:33] <%Bt_Robot> YOU ALSO GOT GOOD RNG. THE MANEATER CAN JUST FLY AWAY FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.
[1:43:33] <ShichiNoBushi> I haven't played any ___ Souls (or Bloodborne), but I have seen a lot of LPs.
[1:43:34] <Fefe41> I wish there was a global death count we could check for each boss
[1:43:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> what if i don't remember maneater tho
[1:43:34] <very_ap3> OH dark souls 1 lol. i did play that
[1:43:36] <%Monkeyweed21> WHOOA HERE SHE COMES
[1:43:40] <tolloponik> it's the Wal that hates you
[1:43:42] <%Zeikier> MANACONDA!!!
[1:43:44] <kingmemelord97> wow thats a fast run to the boss
[1:43:45] <Aydarkzero> it actually did have that effect since i played darks souls a day after beating Demon's
[1:43:46] <+RedKazoo> but Taurus is first?
[1:43:46] <%Kaask> Kaask subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 2 month streak! what do i put here
[1:43:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Belltower is the first real wall
[1:43:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least Maneater there's only two
[1:43:52] <%hax_metatron> Totally agree about sound design in the remake. I beat the original like 50 times, but the new game makes things feel different purely because of sound design
[1:43:55] <%CombatTeddy8> ok. were is this going
[1:44:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's almost like they knew
[1:44:01] <%Zeikier> and then DS2 does the comedy option LUL
[1:44:01] <%moogleboy1984> the DS2 Gargoyles are arguably worse
[1:44:01] <%josstil> like they knew
[1:44:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:44:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt BB"s maneater is the living failures right?
[1:44:09] <+chiazam> I wonder why the run to the boss is so fast
[1:44:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> No theif ring
[1:44:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you need to beat Taurus Demon to access the Bell Gargoyles?
[1:44:17] <%WhereIsWill> he comin down all menacin like
[1:44:19] <Aydarkzero> DS2 is like yo but what if you fought like 4 of them
[1:44:22] <Mangahero18> I thought that the Gargoyle's were pretty challenging because I had no idea how to deal with two tough enemies at the same time.
[1:44:28] <%Aeogard> Pat what happened to the Old Spice
[1:44:28] <%josstil> cool
[1:44:30] <+santafer> its pays for itself
[1:44:30] <JetpackMcQuack> And he comes back!
[1:44:32] <%Zeikier> the spice must flow, etc
[1:44:39] <SirItGoBoomAlot> Spicy
[1:44:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's like that rat one in ds2 that was so bullshit they put a bonfire in front of the fog door
[1:44:43] <%DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt does "block everything with big shield" not work in demon souls
[1:44:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea 6 is max
[1:44:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @SirKeigan you have to pull some BULLSHIT to bypass Taurus without the Master Key
[1:44:53] <%AFlyingTaco1> Imagine the Maneater fight x4. Just delete the game at that point.
[1:44:55] <%T_Sasquatch> I beat those guys solo in ds2 PogChamp
[1:45:00] <+Jaysky> Fuckin rat boss
[1:45:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Comparison always seems to diminish something when it doesn't need to.
[1:45:06] <%Zeikier> original maneater is kind of generic gargoyle face
[1:45:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> @AncelDeLambert Nevermind then
[1:45:10] <tolloponik> man eater looked kinda Ass in OG
[1:45:11] <%Aeogard> maneater update is perfectly fine tbh
[1:45:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Going back in time is telling
[1:45:23] <+burntbagels13> Can you still cheese him through the fog door?
[1:45:24] <peachy996> It's the Fat Official I don't like the redesign of
[1:45:27] <%Zeikier> in the lore of this world Maneater works
[1:45:27] <%collind99> IT LOOKS BETTER AND MORE LORE CORRECT NOW
[1:45:29] <%superc37> the og maneater looked almost like a bronze statue
[1:45:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's like complaining about animation using a screenshot of a smear frame
[1:45:31] <+TheCrispyBoi> maneater looks fine tho>
[1:45:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> maneater is fine
[1:45:35] <%AFlyingTaco1> Bluepoint made it so people actually have to git gud this time.
[1:45:36] <peachy996> Loses a lot of the creep factor
[1:45:38] <%Gogogolem> I think both look like garbage.
[1:45:39] <%josstil> excues me
[1:45:39] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt its like comparing animation stills when theyre supposed to be viewed in motion
[1:45:42] <+tigerfang86> imagine biting your own self
[1:45:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's like motherfuckers who post in-between frames of animation as proof that the animation is bad in something.
[1:45:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maneater looks like a monster, that's fine
[1:45:44] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[1:45:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fat Official is the problem
[1:45:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> crybabys got 99% of what they wanted and still raise hell about the smallest things
[1:45:47] <%AncelDeLambert> awww, I was hoping Pat had just Tarkus'd Maneater
[1:45:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Why it do dat?
[1:45:48] <NeroInfinite> Is man eater just that thingfrombeserk?
[1:45:50] <+Tucker0603> why did his tail bite him?
[1:45:53] <%Zeikier> thief ring makes this fight annoying cuz he can just peace out forever
[1:45:54] <%AFlyingTaco1> @burntbagels13 Nope. They fixed that one.
[1:45:55] <+Grayhammatter> and away he goes
[1:45:55] <devanmuse> uh... goodbye
[1:45:55] <%superc37> satsukis redesign is kinda very racist tho
[1:45:57] <+N0bdyNoOne> The fuck
[1:46:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> it looks like something that eats mans
[1:46:01] <%Bt_Robot> YUP, THIS IS AN AVERAGE FIGHT
[1:46:02] <+N0bdyNoOne> Why'd he just peace out?
[1:46:04] <%Zeikier> the tail bite buffs him if you wait too long
[1:46:04] <2deep5u> my planet needs me
[1:46:06] <Overloard> this really janked out
[1:46:07] <Mangahero18> Can this boss charge you and fall off the stage and eat shit or no?
[1:46:09] <Brofarian> I have to go now my home planet needs me
[1:46:13] <+burntbagels13> GOOD
[1:46:16] <%collind99> Hess supposed to be like an alchemical creation using humans as test subject or whatever
[1:46:16] <%josstil> oh
[1:46:17] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaaaay you stunlocked him!
[1:46:18] <Aydarkzero> round two!
[1:46:20] <+chiazam> ohhhhhhhhhhh
[1:46:21] <%AFlyingTaco1> @Mangahero18 No
[1:46:22] <%superc37> plus the fat official looks like shit
[1:46:22] <+Grayhammatter> double maneater monkaS
[1:46:23] <cipher758> oh
[1:46:24] <HoneySweetSugarBeat> Oh, I SEE
[1:46:24] <%Laecerelius> 1/2 done
[1:46:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Sometimes, a character is supposed to look good moving. It's why anybody posting still frames of "bad animation" are idiots.
[1:46:25] <Frostydough1> goodbyr
[1:46:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> doable
[1:46:25] <%AncelDeLambert> this is some Four Kings bullshit
[1:46:25] <IminyourBase> LOL it's just gargoyles
[1:46:26] <DianaTheAscian> very lucky

[1:46:29] <%hax_metatron> @overloard Trust me this is how it plays out everytime. There‚Äôs a lot of jank here
[1:46:33] <+RowenCleric> I dont get the fat official complaint, they always looked dumb?
[1:46:33] <UlriktheSlayer1> okay yeah fuck this
[1:46:33] <%T_Sasquatch> That sound is rad
[1:46:34] <%Jaxnos> uh

[1:46:43] <Meltgar> WTF
[1:46:44] <%Zeikier> I like the kinda human-like screams coming out the maneaters
[1:46:46] <+Grayhammatter> god this arena looks like it sucks
[1:46:46] <+tigerfang86> BONK
[1:46:48] <%Aeogard> I think allthe non-human updates are pretty good, I think the NPCs and characters are where the remake falls in its designs
[1:46:48] <+tigerfang86> B O N K
[1:46:48] <kenny_biff> its just the gargoyle fight LUL
[1:46:49] <Meltgar> did it got stuck on the air?! LUL

[1:47:08] <GoogleyGareth> Amazing
[1:47:09] <peachy996> @RowenCleric It's not that they look dumb they just don't look as good or better than the old version
[1:47:16] <Cobaltor_252> god the sound design in this is something else
[1:47:19] <kenny_biff> @AFlyingTaco1 I believe it
[1:47:20] <+tigerfang86> its like a GUN

[1:47:40] <%Zeikier> this version of the theme is way better, the original sounded super condescending
[1:47:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> Fall off boys
[1:47:42] <%superc37> Like my biggest problem with the remake is how they complete change a lot of the npc designs just to show off their lip sync tech. yknow, the last thing anyone playing a souls game would care about by now
[1:47:42] <Srthunda> that was close
[1:47:42] <Morbidmort> monkaS

[1:47:53] <+chiazam> GOTTEM
[1:47:53] <%DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt I recently pklayed ds1 for the first time and once you know how the combat works you can totally fight both ds1 garygoyles at once with a good shield and the fencing sword you find in new londo ruins. it took me ten minutes but one shot em with second character in that game
[1:47:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Damn, he's good.
[1:47:54] <+applefibs> pat making scared baby noises while hiding behind a jank shield
[1:47:54] <%collind99> @peachy996 for what the lore of what the maneaters are, the new design makes more sense

[1:48:09] <%CombatTeddy8> no sweat
[1:48:09] <Mangahero18> personally I think the fire stream spell or whatever does more bang for your buck. It looks like it can do the same amount of damage for slightly less MP.
[1:48:09] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt alright now do it with a melee build
[1:48:10] <+TheBitingIrish> The effect for the yell attack is super good

[1:48:37] <%AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt I've noticed that this game feels way, WAY easier than all the other Souls games.
[1:48:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Melee is so satisfying

[1:51:44] <%bread_assassin> Don't you need black character tendency for her to come?
[1:51:45] <%superc37> isnt she on the ground floor?

[1:52:13] <%king_wragles> Why throw yourself off the ledge again? So you don't die as a human somewhere?
[1:52:14] <RyuuAoi> Welp...

[1:52:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> how
[1:52:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TRUDEAU TIME
[1:52:27] <%AncelDeLambert> How could you, Pat, now Clarence will never get his wings!
[1:52:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> How do you change character tendency?
[1:52:39] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:52:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> Pat "If it ain't pure black, you won't be coming back" Boivin
[1:52:40] <jellssssss20> THIS is what the Time Cube would want!
[1:52:42] <%Aeogard> we talm bout lahabrea again
[1:52:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> @king_wragles Pretty much. If he dies in another world in human form, the tendency of that world shifts towards black.
[1:52:46] <lastnamesilverlastname> Noballs
[1:52:52] <tolloponik> @king_wragles it's to keep world tendency from getting fucked
[1:52:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Midnight188 he shouldn't have left Kingdom Hearts then.
[1:52:58] <rkytek> @rkytek It sucks dawg. Tarnishes the Breath franchise. Hyrule warriors much better as a Zelda dynasty warrior.
[1:52:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> @midnight188 yeah and one of them is wearing a fucking Namazu helmet
[1:52:59] <%captain_thickthighs> @BallerSwagBro9k I wish we could up vote comments cause thats a hilarious
[1:53:00] <RyuuAoi> Bad end coming
[1:53:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> PUT C L I N G back on
[1:53:04] <Calek> I screwed up my completionist file, I'll be starting over sometime in the future
[1:53:05] <Enthusi> wise choice, so smart, so handsome
[1:53:09] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt what levels are left?
[1:53:11] <Calek> and by screwed up I mean made it harder for myself
[1:53:14] <+zzNamttamzz> tiny health bar
[1:53:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> Did pat kill that cool manta ray boss yet
[1:53:16] <%josstil> Why do people not like Age of Calamity?
[1:53:20] <Heyestus> "Local streamer decides not to commit suicide just to get what he wants"
[1:53:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> binky health pat
[1:53:29] <jellssssss20> Skeleton Warriors!
[1:53:39] <Midnight188> Lahabrea is just Discount Xemnas.
[1:53:40] <Aliensigma> @patstaresat Not getting the insanity catalyst?
[1:53:40] <+g4mejoy> @king_wragles Yes, if he dies in human form in an archstone area it'll lower the world tendency there. If he dies in the Nexus, nothing bad happens, and he's no longer human to risk lowering world tendency somewhere.
[1:53:40] <%Aeogard> oh so he's gonna beat it today if he's not bad!
[1:53:42] <+alphonseisbest> How do u cange character tendancy? @PatStaresAt
[1:53:43] <%Bt_Robot> OLD KING?
[1:53:45] <ulcaban> pop pop

[1:53:53] <%hax_metatron> 3-3
[1:53:53] <Cobaltor_252> might as well be carrying a gun around
[1:53:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @josstyl_0 time travel AUs make people super butthurt
[1:53:54] <very_ap3> I dont like age of calamity because they marketed it as a prequel and its not a fuckin prequel lol
[1:53:55] <%Order_of_Mystery> @patstaresat can't get everything in one run? perhaps a second run of DeS on stream could fix that... psaBlind
[1:53:56] <RyuuAoi> In 3 hours and 12 minutes!

[1:54:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C L I N G
[1:54:27] <Calek> you kill NPC's to get black character tendency, and kill specific black phantoms to get pure white
[1:54:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Cling Ring
[1:54:28] <%bread_assassin> Doesn't murdering NPCs make you blacker as well?
[1:54:32] <+chiazam> Its time for Pat to kill innocent players who did nothing wrong
[1:54:35] <emeraldskrull> Fuck pat
[1:54:40] <skyentombment> Guys, I think Pat will not finish the game today
[1:54:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Put CLING back on oooonnn

[1:54:51] <silver__viii> man magic looks so cool in this game
[1:54:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> He can finish today if he stays up for another 3-4 houors
[1:55:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> @chiazam Their biggest sin is to exist
[1:55:08] <+Eclecticaf> Is the stealth ring cheese on Maneater is still possible i wonder? I saw spy do it on his Royale play through years ago

[1:55:31] <%josstil> @Monkeyweed21 surely there must be something else too though. I thought it was at least handled well. It was more about getting to know the characters than the story from my perspective.

[1:58:52] <silver__viii> part of me wishes there was less of a visual indicator that you're playing in soul form so it isn't as glowy, since many players just play the whole game that way

[2:01:06] <doublemasteramerica> So the first time i played demon souls and completed a run i thought the game was just dark and most of the "daylight" levels just took place in the evening or night. Then on my second playthrough my friend told me to look at the sun and i realized my brightness was a wee bit low
[2:01:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> this game looks shiny
[2:01:12] <doublemasteramerica> It's a very pretty robe

[2:14:51] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt speaking of MMOs u think theres any truth to SE level squishing in FF14?
[2:14:52] <+CapnClassix> What happened to warframe
[2:14:52] <%T_Sasquatch> Wtf
[2:14:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> destiny 2 is bad, and bungie are shit

[2:15:00] <Overloard> BLEEDBORNE
[2:15:00] <%koolaid_kevster> DESTINY SUCKS
[2:15:05] <%Bt_Robot> ONE SHOT
[2:15:06] <%Estuko> @PatStaresAt I don't think you're winning
[2:15:09] <%ChaosAethr> What number is pat to Old monk?
[2:15:09] <%T_Sasquatch> Is the boss balanced to your level
[2:15:10] <RyuuAoi> Call @PeachSaliva. She can beat it!

[2:15:13] <Mangahero18> Welp, this is where the stream is. It was a good run everybody!
[2:15:16] <%AFlyingTaco1> Gambit is fucking infuriating
[2:15:17] <%AncelDeLambert> season passes suck ass
[2:15:23] <%Bt_Robot> MONK'S SPAGHETTI
[2:15:25] <%AFlyingTaco1> Crucible sucks ass too.
[2:15:25] <huskarl_zap> i hate mmo busy work
[2:15:34] <+BWood63> It's sad because there is a real good game in there.
[2:15:38] <%Laecerelius> Gotta do those MMO dailies!
[2:15:44] <Bluewolf544> Gambit is so poorly made it's impressive
[2:15:45] <RyuuAoi> BREATHE, PAT. MEDIATION IS KEY.
[2:15:46] <%captain_thickthighs> @PatStaresAt I went from warframe to destiny, pray for me... BibleThump
[2:15:50] <%AFlyingTaco1> AND you have to pay for it
[2:15:50] <+CapnClassix> Ever gonna touch Warframe again?
[2:15:51] <RyuuAoi> MEDITATIONS
[2:15:51] <%debugdrawray_> they litterally took away 75% of the game away too LOL
[2:15:52] <+alphonseisbest> would be better off playing MHWORLD
[2:15:57] <%N0bdyNoOne> @PatStaresAt I just finished heavensward, and am finding it hard to be bothered about stormsblood. Do I keep trying?
[2:15:58] <%Zeikier> *voice cracks* THESE ARE. Repellent. Game Flavors.
[2:15:59] <+TheBitingIrish> @captain_thickthighs Go back
[2:16:00] <%SirGO0SE> Every non-bounty-bullet fired feels like you wasted minutes off your life its the worst
[2:16:01] <%coreyyotto> that's what a lot of us have been saying for a while
[2:16:03] <cobalt_phoenix_> you got this
[2:16:05] <+bear_breaker20> the point is to spend all your time playing,,,, all of it
[2:16:08] <%Estuko> @captain_thickthighs hopefully destiny does become something you actually enjoy
[2:16:14] <+ThunderZebraKing> The point is give us more money :)
[2:16:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> yeah you have to pay for the new expansion that takes away old content... that you paid for
[2:16:17] <%Monkeyweed21> yo Shadowlands sucks so far @PatStaresAt
[2:16:23] <Bluewolf544> @captain_thickthighs Don't do it amigo....
[2:16:23] <%ArchimerCXV> no but validate people's choices to stay out of loss aversion pat
[2:16:24] <%AFlyingTaco1> No shut up that's hard, give us money
[2:16:28] <%ChaosAethr> the point is "Fuck you, Pay Me"
[2:16:33] <RyuuAoi> Round four. FIGHT
[2:16:39] <JetpackMcQuack> Borderlands did it right
[2:16:46] <Gorgs7> Destiny is hot trash, end of story
[2:16:47] <KingVantq> Its impastabul
[2:16:47] <%Aeogard> shadowlands DOES suck, i say as im leveling right now
[2:16:47] <+tangoragahn> Its why I prefer Warframe
[2:16:47] <%T_Sasquatch> @n0bdynoone Bruh really ? Are you on the free trial ?
[2:16:50] <+alphonseisbest> Man why does 14 do it so right LUL
[2:16:54] <@commanderclaw> These are some real ass people
[2:16:54] <%debugdrawray_> it fucking ruins my mind that mmos for YEARS have figured out a way to maintain content and bungie just goes "nah"
[2:16:56] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yup
[2:16:59] <devanmuse> we dealing with a REALsKILLER over here
[2:16:59] <%ChaosAethr> ????????????????
[2:17:04] <+TheotherKristian> Oh Wow its an actual person as Old Monk
[2:17:08] <%AFlyingTaco1> That man is broken, but we love him for it
[2:17:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Destiny 2 vaulted the main campaign.
[2:17:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Hard to make a game last 10 years
[2:17:15] <%shurtal> When max was doing old monk, his first real player matchup hit him with inferno right when he came through the fog door. So unfair
[2:17:23] <RyuuAoi> Alright you got this. Clear head. Low and slow @patstaresat
[2:17:25] <lastnamesilverlastname> And then they took the game away too LUL
[2:17:26] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[2:17:27] <+Epic_Fubar> its true
[2:17:28] <%DedlokPM> @devanmuse not anymore. they returned to their world mogsLUL
[2:17:31] <%AncelDeLambert> pew pew pew pew
[2:17:33] <%AFlyingTaco1> @shurtal Thaaaaaaaat's Demon's Souls!
[2:17:33] <+TheBitingIrish> Imagine listening to a SINGLE PLAYER from a playerbase of thousands
[2:17:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, designing your game only to tailor to the upper 1% of players, that won't backfire.
[2:17:37] <%SirGO0SE> @JetpackMcQuack tell that to Nintendo, theyre trying to stop their games from lasting that long
[2:17:42] <huskarl_zap> bot?
[2:17:42] <Maids4lyfe> I was pissed I never got the Recluse and it was taken away
[2:17:48] <%T_Sasquatch> Its always like removing content is a shit uodatst
[2:17:49] <toothfaery> i‚Äôm enjoying destiny 2 right now somehow but goddamn the weapon shit is so miserable lol
[2:17:51] <JetpackMcQuack> lol
[2:17:54] <%T_Sasquatch> Update *
[2:18:01] <RyuuAoi> RISKY
[2:18:01] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCaco Pat gonna fireball ya psaCaco
[2:18:04] <%hermitsen> tough to build a game around the .1% of people that play it as a job but also have the largest soapbox to complain from
[2:18:05] <+RowenCleric> Sshoooryuken!
[2:18:09] <%josstil> roly poly
[2:18:11] <%captain_thickthighs> @Estuko The shooting is great but the loot system is a pain. I started last season and now my spare rasions is usless
[2:18:15] <+deviljhojho_> those AI dodges
[2:18:18] <Aydarkzero> you can just buy recluse at a vendor btw
[2:18:20] <Mangahero18> I wonder if people are watching pats stream and putting on armor to mitigate his magic damage when they get picked
[2:18:20] <RyuuAoi> Calm down
[2:18:24] <+BWood63> It's one of those games that insists on being the only thing you play. Forever.
[2:18:24] <%Aeogard> @hermitsen like most mmos tbh LUL
[2:18:25] <Bluewolf544> This AI isn't making it free that's for sure
[2:18:30] <%N0bdyNoOne> @T_Sasquatch Nah, I ended up paying so I could scale more. But currently every things feels super obvious in terms of plot. I mean, sure they kill off people to keep you hooked but otherwise it all above board so far
[2:18:32] <%josstil> gottem
[2:18:32] <%Niney_Who> He gave up

[2:18:47] <jorniev> FIRST TRY
[2:18:47] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt speaking of MMOs u think theres any truth to SE level squishing in FF14?
[2:18:48] <%captain_thickthighs> No honor
[2:18:49] <Gorgs7> WoW has been half-assing it for 15-20 years, and I personally loathe it, but I'll still admit they do a better job than anything destiny related
[2:18:49] <RyuuAoi> U HAD IT IN U A
[2:18:54] <SirItGoBoomAlot> A winner is you
[2:18:54] <+BWood63> Flawless
[2:18:58] <@commanderclaw> Why so many chairs tho?
[2:19:02] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt So its just about the grind for weapons, there isn't any good main story content?
[2:19:02] <%Monkeyweed21> kill yourself first @PatStaresAt
[2:19:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> is that a mushroom
[2:19:03] <RyuuAoi> U Had it in u all along.
[2:19:04] <jorniev> I CANT BELIVE IT, NOBODY EVER DID THAT
[2:19:09] <%AFlyingTaco1> I played Destiny for a few hours the other day and didn't get a single new weapon from dozens of engrams. Just more fuckin' duplicates.

[2:20:00] <cipher758> i have been reduced to saying only one word DOG
[2:20:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you ever see the list of removed content in Destiny 2 and how its literally half the game @PatStaresAt ?
[2:20:01] <Ravingpyro> zangief
[2:20:05] <%Wallabri> look at that big big baby
[2:20:05] <Overloard> sire, the peasants are revolting because the chair economy has collapsed, shall we redistribute yours?

[2:20:26] <Mangahero18> All dogs are stinky
[2:20:29] <%ChaosAethr> Thats dumb
[2:20:31] <leinadtonu> Paidge lives! YAY!
[2:20:33] <%Monkeyweed21> They removed Whisper of the Worm and Zero Hour @PatStaresAt
[2:20:35] <RyuuAoi> Sup Gief
[2:20:41] <Mangahero18> They go to stink heaven.
[2:20:41] <mr_slaide> THE GIEF.
[2:20:41] <Aydarkzero> didn't know so many people loved Mercury content Kappa
[2:20:44] <%AFlyingTaco1> Someone made a list of all the weapons they took out as opposed to new ones, and it's abysmal.
[2:20:48] <+chiazam> INSANITY CATALYST
[2:20:58] <%WhereIsWill> insanity catalyst yeyeye
[2:21:01] <+lethallylactic> Insane in the membrane
[2:21:02] <+tigerfang86> what
[2:21:05] <+tigerfang86> oh
[2:21:05] <%MyNameIsRasus> IT FUCKS HARD
[2:21:09] <%T_Sasquatch> Hope you guys are ready for destiny 3 to repeat the exact same mistakes
[2:21:13] <%N0bdyNoOne> Was about to ask about it
[2:21:19] <%AzureGale> "This thing FUCKS" - How I describe dildos
[2:21:21] <+waltzqueen> it can totally GET IT
[2:21:22] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[2:21:27] <%AFlyingTaco1> It's the hypest
[2:21:27] <+Fycadius> Idunno what you'd use my donation for, maybe toys for doggo or McDonalds to sate Paige's unending hunger or whatever xD
[2:21:28] <Cobaltor_252> lmao that's a lie
[2:21:30] <lastnamesilverlastname> I hate that Destiny 2 could've been good.
[2:21:35] <RyuuAoi> Game is a fuk
[2:21:36] <cipher758> that thing fucks
[2:21:37] <+BWood63> Christ
[2:21:42] <Overloard> wtf? thats dumb
[2:21:42] <Morbidmort> Man am I glad I got off the Destiny thing back in the first game
[2:21:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> yeah, the only zones left are the shore, awoken city, and europa
[2:21:43] <%T_Sasquatch> No way that's true
[2:21:43] <mr_slaide> I hope the same idiots buy Destiny 3 and refuse to admit it's another failure.
[2:21:46] <toothfaery> almost all my favorite weapons in destiny that i spent ages grinding for and masterworking are now useless trash, don‚Äôt you just love it
[2:21:46] <redrins> bungie really making sure some people wont return to the game huh
[2:21:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> Because they fucks
[2:21:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> maybe Io?
[2:21:54] <Cobaltor_252> @T_Sasquatch it's not
[2:21:54] <lastnamesilverlastname> It could've been good! It nearly WAS good!
[2:21:56] <Aydarkzero> the only grenade launcher you need is Anarchy LUL
[2:21:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Because...it fucks?
[2:22:00] <%Zeikier> oh cool you just spelled out why Mobius Final Fantasy fuckin tanked
[2:22:01] <%SirGO0SE> exactly. there isnt any permanence
[2:22:02] <cobalt_phoenix_> while not as extreme, that's how I feel about warframe stuff at the moment too
[2:22:03] <%Monkeyweed21> they literally removed the best missions in the game, Whisper and Zero Hour
[2:22:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> Destiny 2 leads to nihilism
[2:22:06] <%WhereIsWill> destiny is soo cool but I'll never get into it for too many reasons
[2:22:10] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The only weapon I grind for is the +5 Crushing Claymore in this game.
[2:22:16] <%Estuko> I love the running upstairs animation
[2:22:21] <%Monkeyweed21> and 5 of the 7 raids
[2:22:22] <%josstil> if only bungie would go back to making halo games
[2:22:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> For now, supposedly
[2:22:23] <Ravingpyro> LUL
[2:22:27] <%Zeikier> splat
[2:22:33] <Visorak6> Two of the best missions in the game
[2:22:36] <Maids4lyfe> you can buy Whisper and Outbreak Perfected now
[2:22:42] <RyuuAoi> To be fair, Destiny 2 was broke from the jump. Can't be too upset.
[2:22:43] <KingVantq> they removed the entire base game and the first 2 dlcs
[2:22:52] <Fefe41> Bungie bullshit has been ongoing since D1
[2:22:53] <%AFlyingTaco1> No give us money
[2:22:59] <%SirGO0SE> how about they fucking develop content because people are giving them money
[2:22:59] <%Monkeyweed21> or even have a chance of getting powerful gear
[2:23:00] <+BWood63> Bungie can stay the fuck away from Halo
[2:23:00] <Thalchampz> like XIV?
[2:23:02] <%WhereIsWill> oh you mean LIKE FF14?!?!
[2:23:02] <%Zeikier> PAT THAT WOULD NEVER WORK
[2:23:04] <%captain_thickthighs> Dammit I'm just gonna stick to playing ff9 now
[2:23:04] <lastnamesilverlastname> Gib dosh
[2:23:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey at least destiny still HAS raids
[2:23:07] <%Zeikier> LUL
[2:23:07] <%Aeogard> even wow does that better now surprisingly LUL
[2:23:08] <Bluewolf544> no but money tho
[2:23:14] <Bluewolf544> gibe more moneys
[2:23:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> Bungie is grossly incompetent, and I'm annoyed they don't get enough shit for it
[2:23:18] <+Ragnvaldr_AGH> it's a good game with piles of garbage piled on top of it
[2:23:18] <Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt the new raid's like that, but why they couldn't have done that retroactively to other ones is beyond me
[2:23:24] <%Monkeyweed21> You dont even have a chance of getting powerful gear from the raids
[2:23:28] <kenny_biff> destiny is a failed project
[2:23:35] <%Zeikier> pat has the insanity of a manatee
[2:23:43] <cipher758> it sure fucks
[2:23:43] <jellssssss20> Wasn't the change that any drops have a chance to be better than your gear now?
[2:23:45] <i_am_therydon> not leveling up?
[2:23:46] <%Zeikier> cuz iut fu- yep
[2:23:49] <+Grayhammatter> this guy fucks
[2:23:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> O....k
[2:23:53] <lucky_icarus> Well the new raid that just came out had the highest day 1 turnout. its not even a competition. its like 50k and the next highest was like 20k. which is pretty neat.
[2:23:53] <%Jaxnos> i wish people would look at my insanity catalyst
[2:23:55] <%DedlokPM> You HP not MP
[2:23:56] <%Aeogard> your dad doesnt just have sex pat, your dad FUCKS

[2:24:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @lucky_icarus helps when theres no other content
[2:24:29] <Ravingpyro> what the fuck are those flying rays
[2:24:29] <%AzureGale> Just look at Patron spurting out all that magic damage
[2:24:41] <RyuuAoi> Beefy

[2:30:22] <Sol_Install> holy shit that dude fucking roll
[2:30:42] <i_am_therydon> no swirly hat pat?
[2:30:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Black Armory and the Menagerie were great because Bungie didnt make them @PatStaresAt
[2:30:47] <%Laecerelius> Destiny seemed to go from trash to good from an expansion to expansion basis for a while from what I can gather.
[2:30:50] <UlriktheSlayer1> it went to shit when they killed cayde to drum up hype and couldnt even get nathan fillion back
[2:30:53] <jellssssss20> Swirly hat is hidden
[2:30:55] <%collind99> @patstaresat do you have any recommended builds for beginners
[2:30:57] <@commanderclaw> "What if we took away people's toys?" Said developer who doesn't understand the genre they're working in
[2:30:59] <+alphonseisbest> does D2 still have shit story?
[2:31:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt "don't worry guys we won't sunset weapons!"
[2:31:08] <Cobaltor_252> @Monkeyweed21 Bungo bad amirite

[2:31:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> @captain_thickthighs they literally charged you money for them to remove a metric fuck ton of content... that you already paid for
[2:31:31] <%captain_thickthighs> Well shoot
[2:31:35] <%Anime_Flux> ayyy there we go
[2:31:36] <$realm_forge> @alphonseisbest the story is actually amazing but it‚Äôs not the most accessible
[2:31:45] <huskarl_zap> dont like tge look and sound they used to be better
[2:31:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> This place looks so much more detailed than before
[2:31:55] <%ArchimerCXV> @alphonseisbest riffing and rewriting more competant lore and worldbuilding for a good few years, yeah it is
[2:31:56] <+thechungiestofbois> @TheotherKristian yes, my friend invaded me broke my weapons then suicided
[2:32:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Before it was just a vaguely textured cave

[2:32:27] <Aydarkzero> no
[2:32:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @Cobaltor_252 Black Armory and Menagerie were literally made by Vicarious Vision and High Moon

[2:33:15] <DazzlingFuhrer> Pretty sneaky, sis!
[2:33:16] <huskarl_zap> do they not giggle while close anymore?
[2:33:17] <+BisoromiBear> double sneaked
[2:33:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt switching to kris or were you just holding for magic damage
[2:33:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:33:19] <Sol_Install> there invisible backstabbers
[2:33:21] <jellssssss20> Did that ghost just backstab punish you?
[2:33:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> what were those things?
[2:33:23] <%Emperor_Machinus> the sneakiest of sneak men
[2:33:23] <+thechungiestofbois> Pat trying to be cool and immediately eating shit, name a more iconic duo
[2:33:24] <Higaraishi> well there sure was someone
[2:33:25] <%WhereIsWill> shotgun would be good for this

[2:33:30] <%Zeikier> I miss the sexy ghost giggle
[2:33:31] <+TheotherKristian> Why did you feel like there was a backstabber there, that's so weird...
[2:33:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thouoght this area only had ghosts and reapers
[2:33:35] <%josstil> NO ONE EXPECTS THE BACKSTABBER BROTHERS
[2:33:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why not kris instead of falchion? aren't they pretty similar in damage?
[2:33:48] <RyuuAoi> When's shield.
[2:33:49] <doublemasteramerica> ouch
[2:33:56] <%luckysteak> why is his health halved? is that because he is not human or something?
[2:33:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @Cobaltor_252 dude I'm literally stating a fact that Bungie got a bunch of help from outside studios for the Year 2 Pass
[2:34:06] <%captain_thickthighs> I just ran through this area to the boss back in the day
[2:34:09] <magiclottie> i would say that this stage is probably my fave to grind for souls
[2:34:11] <%Fooguwu> TING
[2:34:15] <Aydarkzero> @luckysteak soul form lowers health yeah
[2:34:21] <+poto2222> Does the haptic feedback still feel amazing after these many hours?
[2:34:28] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I thought at first they must've made Old Hero harder and then I realized it was because I had summons this time.
[2:34:32] <RyuuAoi> 2 hours and 31 minutes to go!
[2:34:36] <+poto2222> Awesome!
[2:34:37] <doublemasteramerica> Being soul form significantly decreases your max health
[2:34:38] <rufus2k2> the sound of the magic clashing with the weapon is a nice touch
[2:34:42] <%luckysteak> @Aydarkzero thank you for the explanation
[2:34:45] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStares hey u gonna give MHstories 2 a shot when it comes out?
[2:34:48] <%ChestMimik> Not that one
[2:34:48] <%Anime_Flux> nailed it

[2:34:49] <Ner234> Not that one LUL
[2:34:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> YOU DID IT
[2:34:50] <%Laecerelius> Almost
[2:34:50] <%ssjklyco> Shortcut to death
[2:34:50] <Aydarkzero> cat ring?
[2:34:50] <Deadmanslegacy> So, besides pre-order content, has anyone noticed anything new in the game?
[2:34:52] <Sol_Install> welp
[2:34:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> best shortcut
[2:34:53] <%KineKithZen> good shortcut
[2:34:55] <blue8moon> that's the right spot, but you gotta roll onto the pillar
[2:34:56] <+thechungiestofbois> I don't like the triggers for the bow, it feels really weird
[2:34:57] <%AzureGale> hahaha patron ate shit
[2:34:59] <%captain_thickthighs> 50/50 shot
[2:35:04] <%WhereIsWill> 40k souls rip
[2:35:05] <+Arengaur> Not that one im guessing
[2:35:05] <redrins> it WAS a checkpoint... to the archstone
[2:35:08] <Overloard> rate that one foul
[2:35:09] <%Zeikier> a shortcut FROM LIFE
[2:35:09] <+HaloPlayerNamedJohn> black skeleton "I just blocked that magic wit my cleaver!"
[2:35:09] <KasiCrafter> Shortcut to the arcstone maybe LUL
[2:35:11] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I also attempted a shortcut there, with similar results.
[2:35:11] <$realm_forge> @alphonseisbest I definitely wouldn‚Äôt call it the focus or particularly well executed, and you have to be a lore nerd like myself but there‚Äôs a lot of really good story woven in under the surface
[2:35:13] <%josstil> more like deathcut
[2:35:13] <AthenaAegis> I guess that wasn't the shortcut Kappa
[2:35:14] <RyuuAoi> PowerUpL KappaPride PowerUpR
[2:35:19] <cipher758> a shortcut, to death. oh no
[2:35:28] <%ChestMimik> What's that horrible noise? It's awful in a really neat way

[2:36:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> What sounds like an angry saxophone?
[2:36:12] <jellssssss20> It would be cool if the storm went away after defeating Storm King like the sunlight in anor londo
[2:36:15] <Bluewolf544> It sounds like whales more than anything to me

[2:37:03] <mesamus> pat update on the scalper situation, a group has now over 3500 PS5, largest stock currently
[2:37:10] <%penitentpendant> Man, seeing people fall in Demon Souls and not explode on impact with the floor is weirdly jarring
[2:37:10] <%Anime_Flux> Living his best unlife
[2:37:16] <%collind99> Kappa
[2:37:16] <rufus2k2> Daniel Fortesque, NO!
[2:37:18] <jellssssss20> This skeleton puts in WORK
[2:37:28] <%AzureGale> yep
[2:37:29] <blue8moon> There might be another shortcut, I dunno, that's just the one I saw another streamer use
[2:37:35] <RyuuAoi> Fuck scalpels. Font give them power.
[2:37:38] <rekinom> I'm not paying a penny over MSRP
[2:37:38] <+TheBitingIrish> Why isn't scalping fucking illegal
[2:37:38] <Sol_Install> yea seriously
[2:37:39] <UlriktheSlayer1> fuck those people so much
[2:37:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> I is
[2:37:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mesamus It would be terrible if their building caught fire and they lost all of their stock.
[2:37:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> I hope that scalper group catches covid. every last one of them
[2:37:48] <coffeebearCafe> don't support scalpers
[2:37:48] <Aydarkzero> guess i'll just give up FeelsBadMan
[2:37:48] <+ThunderZebraKing> Anyone who pays scalpers deserves to just get an empty box
[2:37:48] <RyuuAoi> It's worth the wait tbh
[2:37:50] <%TinyLittleDancer> There are almost no new games out, just wait. It really isn't worth it at all
[2:37:51] <rufus2k2> can the ATF add a V in there somewhere
[2:37:52] <+thechungiestofbois> I wish I had disposable income to spend scalper prices. Still wouldn't do it though
[2:37:52] <DashXero> 3500? They won't be able to move that many at the prices they're looking for.
[2:37:54] <s_snowball> but how am i supposed to flex on my facebook friends without one
[2:37:54] <%TheWinged7> yeah time to just wait 6 months to when theres more games out anyway
[2:37:56] <Daxalog> You beat the scalpers when you are patient and they have to sell on a loss
[2:38:00] <RyuuAoi> New updated system and you're straight.
[2:38:00] <%SirGO0SE> a group has 3500 PS5's that YOU can overpay for to be a beta tester for Sony PogChamp
[2:38:05] <%YakumoYomi> Fuck those jerks, indeed.
[2:38:06] <PanicSwytch> I never buy new consoles day one. I wait for all the kinks to get fixed
[2:38:06] <Overloard> imagine how stupid they will feel when the next batch comes out
[2:38:08] <Cobaltor_252> just have someone write a bot to shoot the prices up again
[2:38:10] <DXLelouch24> just mod the original out te ass on RPCS3 then youll appreciate the Remake more later
[2:38:11] <+Spoon_fresh> I ruined a friendship because i beat up his buddy for being a scalper, i dont regret it
[2:38:11] <%dekkitout> I hope a horrible electrical storm renders their entire surplus useless üôÉ
[2:38:15] <RyuuAoi> They the generation roll our first.
[2:38:15] <rekinom> I made a scalper drive around my town for about an hour today before finally telling them I'm not giving them my money
[2:38:17] <LoliKappa> @RyuuAoi how are people gonna perform surgery without scalpels?
[2:38:17] <marvel877> Boy I'd like some disposable income to buy that much shit to even attempt to scalp.
[2:38:19] <%Anime_Flux> welp
[2:38:20] <%ChestMimik> The answer is zero damage
[2:38:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Not enough LUL

[2:38:48] <%bread_assassin> I hope it goes the way of that guy who bought thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer, and got shut down by Ebay.
[2:38:52] <KasiCrafter> Now imagine doing this with the ORIGINAL load times
[2:39:02] <%StrifeZubia> Just curious, rocking that cling ring? I still haven't figured out how this game works
[2:39:12] <+deviljhojho_> xenoblade chronicles 2 for me tbh
[2:39:14] <%Monkeyweed21> FF7Remake?
[2:39:19] <%FacetiousAF> zanGIEF
[2:39:24] <+santafer> Folklore
[2:39:40] <himbearbedtime> Dark Souls lol
[2:39:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt It took Max 2 1/2 hours to beat this part and Storm King
[2:39:43] <%TinyLittleDancer> I've had that experience more with books or movies.
[2:39:45] <rufus2k2> i love that deflecting metal sound
[2:39:48] <%captain_thickthighs> Magic'pngel
[2:39:51] <Daxalog> Will he respond more if you say Bon apetite
[2:39:57] <PanicSwytch> Gief is probably eating elmo's food
[2:40:03] <%penitentpendant> I've managed to 'sell' 3 friends on buying Hades. The have a combined playtime of 4 hours.
[2:40:05] <marvel877> I never did finish Folklore, but I really don't want to do that mandatory install.
[2:40:06] <armandolorian> almost like you are doing the Feeny call
[2:40:08] <%YakumoYomi> @deviljhojho_ Really? Reception seems generally positive for XC2, outside of your mainstream "Eww anime" people
[2:40:13] <%StrifeZubia> O that makes sense
[2:40:13] <AMaidIndeed> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[2:40:15] <%TinyLittleDancer> Scratch that, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was that game for me. They ruined it with the VA patch tho
[2:40:18] <%josstil> bweow
[2:40:28] <%heartlesshealer> but clim
[2:40:31] <%StrifeZubia> Fuck yeah cling ring
[2:40:34] <Fefe41> Dark silver shield would've been super handy here
[2:40:34] <Thalchampz> right in the ankle
[2:40:39] <%dekkitout> Cling ring do your thing!
[2:40:40] <+ThunderZebraKing> Is that a cling or a clutch?
[2:40:47] <+deviljhojho_> @YakumoYomi i'd say its about half and half, but a lot of people bounced off hard
[2:40:51] <+santafer> good to see magic is still op
[2:40:52] <%Estuko> @YakumoYomi I was so confused, I assumed XCOM2 and then you said anime

[2:54:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's what you get for bullying a disabled person
[2:54:31] <%Jaxnos> Pat has been watching Paige get spooked on the last hit too many times

[2:54:40] <%SaiyanShoto> And if those black phantoms are up it makes the run twice as bad
[2:54:45] <%Dr_DangerPhD> this might be one of the more frustrating boss runs in the series
[2:54:51] <+RowenCleric> if you dont wear the thief ring, its an actual good fight
[2:54:51] <%SleepyDavid> I hate those skeletons
[2:54:53] <Fefe41> It's a short level so probably that's why they didn't add a shortcut

[2:55:47] <%captain_thickthighs> BTW have they deracist zangeif yet?
[2:55:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> It must flow
[2:55:55] <%VvTacoSaladvV> *slaps roof of shrine* this bad boy can fit so many skeletons.
[2:55:57] <%Anime_Flux> the spice extends life
[2:55:59] <%moogleboy1984> oh man, the Storm Mantas sound so fucking rad
[2:56:01] <0rond> @tusk102 so normally him being blind isn't meant to matter? it's more like pat is exploiting a specific weakness?
[2:56:02] <$jaxondorf> spicey bois
[2:56:03] <%penitentpendant> Nice jump
[2:56:09] <+santafer> no shortcuts. Its one of those thing I would've accepted they changed.
[2:56:10] <RyuuAoi> I got a guy who knows a guy who got the spice. @patstaresat
[2:56:15] <DoobieDancer> O boi
[2:56:16] <mr_slaide> BORK
[2:56:19] <%Ascethetic> you must acquire the spice melange
[2:56:20] <%Emperor_Machinus> the spice melange
[2:56:21] <jellssssss20> I was gonna ask why not pluging attack before realizing
[2:56:23] <$jaxondorf> the spice expands conciousness
[2:56:25] <jellssssss20> plunging*
[2:56:31] <Mrscribbles> do you spice?
[2:56:38] <%tusk102> @0rond him being blind can be exploited, but it is very hard to do on a melee build because you are right next to him. pat is just being cheesy
[2:56:41] <%Anime_Flux> the spice is vital to space travel
[2:56:42] <%captain_thickthighs> The. Spice must flow
[2:56:44] <paltar4> What did zangief do? He also humps elmo and is racist?!
[2:56:47] <tacostarvedbeast> does anyone else feel creeped out by just how big the storm king is?
[2:56:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt has zangief been de-racisted yet?
[2:56:55] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Game design pro tip. Just take a normal underwater creature and put it in the fucking sky. Bam, instant monster design.
[2:57:05] <+thechungiestofbois> it goes through walls too
[2:57:05] <%josstil> can't you just duck that corner?
[2:57:07] <%Xelhesia> THE DISTANCE IS ETERNAL
[2:57:09] <jellssssss20> Does that beam go forever?
[2:57:12] <magiclottie> @PatStaresAt how broken would DeS be if you could have 4 rings and nothing else was changed?
[2:57:14] <%josstil> oh
[2:57:22] <$RealThiele> corner ducking is for losers
[2:57:30] <%josstil> can you dodge through it?

[2:57:36] <+santafer> "Yo, what if manta ray... but in the sky!" is the "Superman but evil" of creatures
[2:57:54] <%captain_thickthighs> @paltar4 Sometimes if you don't introduce a pet to other people they get weird, my last dog didn't like white people till my cousin

[2:58:55] <%tusk102> @ssjklyco i bet the only ring will be the elden one
[2:59:01] <%N0bdyNoOne> So do you often beat up old blind men?
[2:59:02] <+Jaysky> Elden Ring won't have rings, it will have a singular ring
[2:59:09] <paltar4> @captain_thickthighs a dog in my family had a similar thing with people with hats
[2:59:11] <%Niney_Who> Bald Wizard bullies Blind man

[2:59:19] <+DinnerCalzone> he's echolocating
[2:59:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did he beat 3-3?

[2:59:46] <+b_aleph> boooo
[2:59:48] <%king_wragles> Why is Pat using a windshield scrapper to cast magic?

[3:00:26] <%captain_thickthighs> Elden ring isn't real
[3:00:31] <Mangahero18> That guy looked a lot like Yorm the Giant
[3:00:37] <%Adojim> why is the old hero a demon?
[3:00:37] <supergoblinpunch> He was just closer
[3:00:54] <Aydarkzero> read his soul?
[3:01:00] <Mangahero18> You sayin demons cant be heroes?
[3:01:02] <+nabby1> Billy from at

[3:01:08] <Aydarkzero> bummer
[3:01:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> or just assumed his form
[3:01:11] <huskarl_zap> is king dolan a demon?
[3:01:11] <%Monkeyweed21> he was the demons
[3:01:13] <2deep5u> he was revived by the fog
[3:01:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can't believe this game demonizes the blind
[3:01:23] <%weissguard> LUL The maiden turned around to see you at it again.
[3:01:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i thought it was because demons are based on people's beliefs or smth so the demon embodied he hero
[3:01:27] <Blank9> old king dolan
[3:01:28] <+zzNamttamzz> weapons have lore in des
[3:01:29] <Heyestus> He's already a demon, Kaz.
[3:01:29] <paltar4> He‚Äôs a fake version like the king
[3:01:32] <devanmuse> what IS a "demon" in this universe?
[3:01:33] <i_am_therydon> my internal logic was the corruption of the island desecrated his soul.
[3:01:37] <%ssjklyco> Maybe it's the myth of if you kill 1000 demons, you become a demon.
[3:01:39] <%za7az> "Old Hero" "Old Monk" Why are all the bosses old?
[3:01:39] <jellssssss20> Is there lore in this game for him/like half the bosses at all?
[3:01:43] <Aydarkzero> @tusk102 that makes sense
[3:01:44] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> the shrine of storms demons are the island's mythology brought to life

[3:06:56] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Dark Souls 3 def borrows a lot from this game but a lot of it is somehow not as good.
[3:07:04] <%moogleboy1984> the fact that they are throwing shards of crystallized lightning at you is rad
[3:07:05] <silver__viii> Swinging the storm ruler blows the rain out of the way it's fucking sick

[3:18:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> whyd you have to kill the whale
[3:18:04] <%penitentpendant> Someone mentioned it has different stats in the raid
[3:18:08] <$Raikouija> Literally the storm that is approaching
[3:18:08] <%penitentpendant> *rain
[3:18:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Its the weapon that inflicts shame damage in PvP @PatStaresAt
[3:18:14] <ScreamLord> Which sucks because it looks rad as shit
[3:18:14] <%DedlokPM> @lycandruid I doubt he cares at all about wow when he plays ff14
[3:18:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @AFlyingTaco1 did it look like that in the original, tho?
[3:18:16] <lycandruid> Shadow-Lands is pretty fun and leveling to max take a few hours
[3:18:21] <KasiCrafter> Uh oh, it's out of rock batteries...
[3:18:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what is the pvp level meta for this game? it seems way lower than dark souls since you're near end of the game at level 60~
[3:18:25] <Mangahero18> Controversial opinion here. I hate gimmick boss fights like Storm King.
[3:18:26] <NeroInfinite> It does nothing outside of the storm.
[3:18:31] <Aydarkzero> Vergil not using Storm Ruler smh my head
[3:18:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why Kris Blade?
[3:18:36] <%tusk102> OH
[3:18:37] <rekinom> @tusk102 still 120
[3:18:38] <%tusk102> OK
[3:18:46] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @AFlyingTaco1 People really started to jump on the "gimmicky bosses bad" line of thinking but a lot the truly unique stuff in these games is in some of the more cinematic, puzzle bosses.
[3:18:46] <Aydarkzero> @SirKeigan magic damage go up
[3:18:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta max your stats
[3:18:49] <%AFlyingTaco1> @AncelDeLambert I don't think it was as intense as in this remake, but I'm not sure.
[3:18:50] <%DedlokPM> @SirKeigan it increases spell damage
[3:18:51] <%tusk102> okay so the same as all the others
[3:18:55] <+JenovaS> Ive gotten a lot of multiplayer at around 40
[3:18:56] <+eanscrale> 120 started with DeS
[3:19:01] <+secretspud> you can make Stormier Ruler!
[3:19:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> nice bowl of chili
[3:19:05] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt a magic spear maybe?
[3:19:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Werd
[3:19:20] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz from that figth alone I'd say the remaster team did real DAMN good with this game
[3:19:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wow, I google'd Kris Blade Wikidot and Fextralife was the first result above Wikidot. WTF
[3:19:30] <lycandruid> @DedlokPM well maybe but im sure that this man that plays video game for a living might enjoy dipping his toes into some shadowlands
[3:19:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it makes the morion blade or anti-magic field
[3:19:43] <%AFlyingTaco1> @VvTacoSaladvV Yup. Like Yhorm may not be a great fight, but it's still really cool.
[3:19:48] <%FacetiousAF> ü§î enchant weapon sounds good
[3:19:51] <%WhereIsWill> yuria of londor? PogChamp
[3:19:56] <count1999> @PatStaresAt how did you get your tendency to black. wanna know incase it was natural or if you went to farm for black
[3:20:10] <Overloard> poopoo res +
[3:20:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> I pronounced it like Morioh but with an "n"
[3:20:38] <MSN04_Sazabi> Moh-Ryan blade? Seriosly Pat? It's pronounce like mori, death
[3:20:42] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @AFlyingTaco1 Yeah, especially if you've been doing Siegward's quest.
[3:20:43] <Mangahero18> Its cool but isnt having a boss with such an obvious weak point kinda disappointing? Its like it takes some of the challenge out of the fight.
[3:20:43] <%DedlokPM> @lycandruid well, considering there is a deluge of stuff that he can play right now and he already has an mmo that he likes and considers better than others of its ilk, I doubt it will happen any time soon
[3:20:49] <%Alazull> I love how this deep in the game that blacksmith still talks shit
[3:20:56] <%Monkeyweed21> moron blade

[3:21:44] <+SolidusRex> It's "Mor Ian", not "Mor I on"
[3:21:51] <%RyTYoung> @sirkeigan There are many Ryan's that are worth punching
[3:22:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why do you not use dlc gear btw? is it just cuz it feels cheaty to you?

[3:22:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ryan Seacrest, for one

[3:23:07] <%Aeogard> oh yeah no 5-2 is so much cooler and easier in remake
[3:23:07] <%ChestMimik> Is this proto-blighttown?

[3:25:40] <%ChestMimik> Do you ever sleep?

[3:27:23] <ahaegotrigger> oh yeah the best of the WORST
[3:27:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> What are those things?

[3:27:27] <silver__viii> @Valentinius_Anodyne removing the shitty framerate ruined the grimdark tone of the original :(
[3:27:28] <jellssssss20> What are these shit jellyfish and why do they live in this shit town
[3:27:32] <DrGasMax> It isn't a Japanese RPG without a poison swap

[3:28:39] <Jack8274> @captain_thickthighs Phil spencer has played a lot
[3:28:41] <%Laecerelius> Gotta combine it with the shield
[3:28:41] <%Aeogard> ring AND shield

[3:28:47] <Overloard> !POO POO AT RISK!
[3:28:48] <SLingard1999> is this area better or worse then blight town?

[3:29:02] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @SLingard1999 Yes
[3:29:03] <+CapnClassix> @Aydarkzero Oh shit that's right. I forgot.
[3:29:05] <Make_me_mad> Elden Ring and Bayo 3 are both totally fake.
[3:29:09] <Aydarkzero> or blessed weapon
[3:29:14] <%josstil> From Soft sure do love these poison swamps
[3:29:17] <royb2> this zone doesnt scream DS3 farron swamp at all
[3:29:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirkeigan Eww, gross
[3:29:23] <$RealThiele> Bayo 3 is more real than ring
[3:29:25] <%Aeogard> plus you can get the blessed mace here in 5-1 still right? thats also poggers
[3:29:27] <%ChestMimik> Those jellyfish make me wanna firebomb the whole region
[3:29:27] <%barrakuta371> poo pee per poo
[3:29:27] <+CapnClassix> First time playing DaS, I ran a faith build specifically to use Moonlight Greatsword. Imagine my dissapoint
[3:29:28] <myfaceisapotato> scientists prove only people that beat bloodborne can see elden ring news. More at 11.
[3:29:32] <rekinom> Elden Ring is a collective hallucination
[3:29:39] <jellssssss20> Pat's Back at risk!
[3:29:41] <DianaTheAscian> souls games must smell awful
[3:29:41] <Jack8274> Jesus
[3:29:44] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Elden Ring is being delayed because they don't know how to tell fans it takes place entirely in a poison swamp.
[3:29:46] <SirJotero> @CapnClassix Oh, that just HURTS.
[3:29:46] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm elden ring agnostic
[3:29:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt being able to see because the games not running at 10 frames a second is nice
[3:29:51] <RyuuAoi> I just st wanna play Bayo 3 rn
[3:29:52] <RevolverBobkat> double tap
[3:29:55] <%josstil> that would be cool
[3:29:56] <royb2> The real Elden Ring is the friends we made along the way
[3:30:01] <%penitentpendant> I'd be shocked... that it still exists
[3:30:01] <+Jaysky> Oooooh Elden Ring
[3:30:03] <%Laecerelius> Pew pew pew
[3:30:03] <+sermittens> We ain't seeing shit
[3:30:03] <Helmed> elden ring will release before cyberpunk
[3:30:06] <Mangahero18> is Moonlight Greatsword good in this game?
[3:30:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> P O I S O N E D
[3:30:09] <RyuuAoi> I want Pat playing Bayo 3 rn
[3:30:11] <%RyTYoung> Bloodborne 2 tho
[3:30:13] <%josstil> or cancled at the game awards
[3:30:14] <godzookylives> Along with Bayonetta 3 Right?
[3:30:17] <tattleworm> pat used his insider knowledge voice
[3:30:18] <Dao_Puppy> elden ring has to exist first...
[3:30:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Mangahero18 It's good but it's a faith weapon
[3:30:19] <%ChestMimik> Why would they show an imaginary game at the Game Awards?
[3:30:20] <jellssssss20> What are these shit jellys even called
[3:30:23] <squirtkitten> if its true that Geroge rr Martin is doing the lore, its never coming out LUL
[3:30:23] <%RyTYoung> Bayo 3 wen
[3:30:24] <+Jaysky> @penitentpendant Apparently Phil Spencer has played it
[3:30:25] <%barrakuta371> Yeah, that would be nice. Probably be another CG trailer, with actual gameplay in 2021
[3:30:26] <$Raikouija> And George RR Martin will apear on stage and say, THE NEXT ASOIAF BOOK WAS NEVER REAL!
[3:30:26] <studleydoorite> DOODS
[3:30:33] <Daxalog> I thought people didnt like the game awards. Until a game they like wins something
[3:30:35] <DrGasMax> I want to see Kojima's horror game
[3:30:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> We're definitely gonna be seeing Cyberpunk at TGA
[3:30:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why isn't there a status bar to show it filling up?
[3:30:50] <Dao_Puppy> Honest conspiracy theory: Miyazaki saw how good this game looked, look at Elend Ring, and went back to improve the visuals a bit.
[3:30:50] <%penitentpendant> @Jaysky Shocked I say
[3:30:56] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @jellssssss20 Poison Jelly
[3:30:56] <$Raikouija> No RR Martin will delete eldin ring and ASOIAF on stage
[3:31:01] <royb2> @Raikouija Nah he will announce that he has finally finished the book. ABOUT WILD CARDS
[3:31:06] <+twohitgood> they added a rusted iron ring equivalent to the game.
[3:31:09] <Mangahero18> Nah, physical copies of Cyberpunk have already gotten out into the wild so the HAVE to release it or they'll look like total chods.
[3:31:17] <+Jaysky> I kinda like the game awards, kinda. I could live without the ads though but gotta pay the bills for it.
[3:31:18] <%captain_thickthighs> How can we get bayo 3 to escape ninetendo purgitory
[3:31:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Until you get the shorcut
[3:31:28] <%RyTYoung> George R.R. Martin has already wrote 3 books to go along side Elden Ring, hence why the game isn't out
[3:31:42] <DrGasMax> Kojima: "Hello everyone, I would like to announce my new horror game and reveal that you have all been actually playing the demo of it all year. My new game is 2021!"
[3:31:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Selene Garland?
[3:31:46] <Fefe41> This place must have really good seafood cuisine, look at all these jellyfish
[3:31:46] <+Jaysky> We must sacrifice Metroid Prime 4 @SirKeigan
[3:31:52] <+Jaysky> Err
[3:31:53] <%josstil> shame that spell doesn't have splash damage
[3:31:55] <%ChestMimik> @captain_thickthighs Sacrifice F Zero and Metroid to a dark god
[3:31:55] <+Jaysky> @captain_thickthighs
[3:31:56] <Mangahero18> I look forward to all the incest that will be in Elden Ring.
[3:31:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Jaysky What?

[3:31:59] <RyuuAoi> I got BLOCKED for asking about Bayo 2, so my Bayo 3 passion is BURNING
[3:32:03] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Raikouija I wish George RR Martin would delete Game of Thrones from my memory. Then I wouldn't have to live with shame of being that hype for a show that ended that badly.
[3:32:04] <Ner234> @captain_thickthighs I actually completely forgot Bayo 3 .
[3:32:06] <royb2> 3 books about the lineages of some far away king 300 years past
[3:32:09] <%Aeogard> garl vinland? or cid garland?
[3:32:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I enjoy The Game Awards too. they kinda got stuck up their own ass last year with their own THEME SONG and shit but otherwise, its entertaining
[3:32:17] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> lol
[3:32:21] <%Laecerelius> Whoops!
[3:32:24] <myfaceisapotato> 2020 is the first strand type year.
[3:32:25] <+twohitgood> bwt 3-2 for rusted iron ring.
[3:32:28] <DennisStreaming> chumpa1RIPIZZA
[3:32:32] <%penitentpendant> This area seems like it begs for regen cheese. Just stand on islands and blast magic and heal then wait to top off. Definetly a slog.
[3:32:34] <+Jaysky> @Jaysky I misread you as sending something when it was captain thickthighs
[3:32:34] <@commanderclaw> "We'll bang it out over the evening"
[3:32:39] <Make_me_mad> Everyone forgot about Bayo 3. That game is the least real sequel I've ever heard of.
[3:32:44] <+Jimboq> face down in the poop sludge
[3:32:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[3:32:46] <%Laecerelius> Yeah go pure black in the tower and get the ring
[3:32:48] <Jack8274> Lol
[3:32:50] <%josstil> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:32:51] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[3:32:52] <Mangahero18> Are there no spells that do splash damage like Chaos Fireball?
[3:32:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Okay, I'm gonna keep getting stoned then @Jaysky
[3:33:00] <CandyCoatedConfection> LUL
[3:33:05] <%Anime_Flux> Is Elden Ring the Scalebound of Dark Souls?
[3:33:06] <%penitentpendant> @commanderclaw Not the most charming of pickup lines
[3:33:07] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[3:33:08] <RyuuAoi> Pat, are you BLOCKED?
[3:33:08] <%Aeogard> finally, the one area that magic cant entirely cheese out
[3:33:09] <Deadmanslegacy> this is where astrea is ain't it?
[3:33:09] <%walternatorz> if you roll, you drink the poopy water
[3:33:19] <DrGasMax> What are you gonna do on December 10th? Watch The Game Awards or play Cyberpunk?
[3:33:21] <Meekest> Did Pat just whisper "bitch" under his breath when someone referenced Paige
[3:33:22] <Ner234> It's astonishing how non-existent Bayo 3 is.
[3:33:30] <Helmed> Why doesnt anyone talk about anarchy reigns
[3:33:33] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm so jaded now I can only hope to be proven wrong
[3:33:35] <NeroInfinite> oh the poisonswamp sucks
[3:33:37] <SirJotero> You can just run past all the jellies. They don't really pursue you or impede you.
[3:33:43] <JayPastaForce> Crazy talk pls do your thing
[3:33:49] <%ssjklyco> I kinda wish they kept the framerate in this area super low
[3:33:52] <Make_me_mad> Bayonetta 3 was a trailer in like 2017 or something. Literally no news since.
[3:33:55] <+Jaysky> If you think Cyberpunk is releasing on the 10th then I've got some bad news
[3:34:02] <%penitentpendant> @Ner234 Plot twist, she's been on maternity leave the whole time
[3:34:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Isn't there a giant enemy nearby?
[3:34:03] <Fefe41> Did you pick up the new ring that lets you run through the swamp
[3:34:06] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The Game Awards feels like an attempt to recreate the Oscars for games in an attempt to create industry legitimacy. Only problem is that the Oscars are terrible and has been a net negative for the film industry.
[3:34:06] <SirJotero> Actually just ignoring it is a viable approach
[3:34:13] <Jack8274> Blightown was the same way
[3:34:14] <%KaiserMario> Plague does a lot more damage
[3:34:17] <RyuuAoi> @meekest Noooooooooo
[3:34:18] <$KnivesEve> wouldnt be surprised if Bayo3 was in the same situation SMT5 was in. i.e. announced far too early
[3:34:20] <Jack8274> It's so much less than you remember
[3:34:26] <marvel877> Joe Dirt: "I got the poo on me!"
[3:34:27] <%captain_thickthighs> @Make_me_mad Wasn't that just a logo?
[3:34:28] <supergoblinpunch> Have you got the Sodden Ring?
[3:34:30] <%penitentpendant> The poison is not as aggressive as other games. Though that makes sense considering how much more limited your healing is in this game.
[3:34:34] <%Aeogard> this is like the only souls game I know of other than 3 that you can just ignore mechanics with regen
[3:34:40] <+Jaysky> @VvTacoSaladvV Gets lots of publicity though. People talk, and that's all they want.
[3:34:41] <Mangahero18> Oh so this isnt just blight town. Its also Chathedral of the Deep
[3:34:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @KnivesEve That's almost certainly it
[3:34:48] <RyuuAoi> Veiny dick comin
[3:34:57] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt whats the worst swamp in the souls series?
[3:35:04] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[3:35:06] <Ner234> BOP
[3:35:06] <%Anime_Flux> daaaamn
[3:35:11] <+gruff_gridof> LUL
[3:35:11] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Jaysky I know. It's good for business. But the cynic in me hates it.
[3:35:11] <%Aeogard> LUL
[3:35:11] <%ssjklyco> CyberPunk2077 forever
[3:35:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damn I wish that killed you lol
[3:35:14] <+g4mejoy> LUL LUL
[3:35:14] <Make_me_mad> @captain_thickthighs It was an incredibly brief teaser that featured Bayo in her Bayonetta 1 costume dying fighting some weird fire enemy, and then a logo.
[3:35:14] <Aydarkzero> he got a good hit in!
[3:35:15] <%Aeogard> THWAP
[3:35:20] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Remember that Woolie's super healing set actually out-healed the poison?
[3:35:24] <%Laecerelius> Get punk'd by chonk
[3:35:35] <%josstil> psaBig
[3:35:38] <Mangahero18> You gotta swing first pat.
[3:35:39] <tehguy5567> LUL
[3:35:43] <squirtkitten> Why LUL you always overpower yourself
[3:35:44] <%KaiserMario> Regenerator set
[3:35:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The Oscars is a rigged selection with very narrow minded views, Its gonna take some effort for TGAs to become "Oscars"
[3:35:50] <%hdhyperdrive> LUL
[3:35:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea
[3:35:56] <Helmed> LUL
[3:35:56] <%Laecerelius> The worst
[3:35:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> You guys coulda have him not use it tho
[3:36:05] <squirtkitten> thats like saying yo uneed the framerate stutters to enjoy Blighttown
[3:36:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait when did Woolie play DeS?
[3:36:07] <+KENTASHIRO> yeah that LP really pissed me off. People being too helpful didn't let him play the game.
[3:36:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:36:10] <%ChestMimik> Wait I thought Woolie hated spoilers?
[3:36:11] <%KaiserMario> Hopefully Reggie won't suffer the same unfair assistance
[3:36:11] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will figure it out
[3:36:11] <DrGasMax> Doesn't matter if it ruins the experience if it spites Pat
[3:36:15] <Mangahero18> When did SBF play DeS?
[3:36:16] <squirtkitten> woolie was happy to use it so he used it LUL
[3:36:17] <%Broken_Sonex> I mean, it's Woolie so he needs them
[3:36:17] <%Laecerelius> But I think you just need the regen ring and shield in order to negate the poison damage anyway
[3:36:18] <dan_g_v> stolen!!
[3:36:21] <%Aeogard> I do kinda love that every build has its own major strengths and weaknesses per area though
[3:36:25] <DianaTheAscian> the lp with Reggie is gonna go well
[3:36:26] <+nabby1> woolieSMUG
[3:36:31] <RyuuAoi> With Reggie... @patstaresat
[3:36:34] <Deadmanslegacy> It would be really cool if Bluepoint would make dlc for this remake.
[3:36:37] <Zebroneath> Reggie will figure it out
[3:36:38] <%penitentpendant> I'm a sucker for regen builds, though I'm not that vexed for any insults towards them
[3:36:40] <jellssssss20> Other people dropping stuff for you is something i would actually consider cheating
[3:36:41] <+mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> @XeroSigmaPrime tga is already rigged tho
[3:36:42] <Fefe41> Yeah can't wait for Reggie to go through DeS
[3:36:43] <+Jaysky> Remember when FF15 got announced back in 2006 and released in 2016
[3:36:44] <Overloard> no u gotta experience every inch of Poo Poo
[3:36:48] <blue8moon> super regen build is good for a second or further run, not the first
[3:36:49] <%Broken_Sonex> Well that's on him the
[3:36:52] <%ClericOfSparda> Good
[3:36:53] <%arancet> pat you talked about cheating the boss through the door, how is him using healing different?
[3:36:54] <%Broken_Sonex> then*
[3:36:57] <+santafer> oh, this hellhole of a level
[3:36:57] <%ClericOfSparda> Let's not listen!
[3:37:01] <Aydarkzero> oh woolie LUL
[3:37:05] <squirtkitten> If he wanted to use it, its up to him LUL dont gatekeep
[3:37:06] <Dao_Puppy> Isn't taking items from your audience just grinding offscreen vicariously?
[3:37:08] <Mangahero18> If you arent cheating you arent trying.
[3:37:09] <RyuuAoi> No one will help Reggie @patstaresat
[3:37:09] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> lol
[3:37:13] <AlvinTheLiar> You also told him not to rub up against the scraping spear
[3:37:15] <%penitentpendant> Still alive!
[3:37:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @mywifeleftme_dot_mp4 XD Sekiro won game of the year last time, no way a rigged system would do that
[3:37:30] <squirtkitten> You defended yourself using the Estoc in DS3 and troucning bosses easily
[3:37:30] <+santafer> Did he fight Selen?
[3:37:32] <BinaryShuffle> Pat, beware of enemy ambushes
[3:37:36] <blue8moon> double thief ring, you will be invisible
[3:37:37] <jellssssss20> Plague!
[3:37:44] <GameOver_Here> @PatStaresAt what's the worst swamp in a Souls game?
[3:37:48] <%tusk102> adjudicators shield, regenerators ring, and then a blessed knight sword +5 was woolies gear @PatStaresAt
[3:37:50] <%Broken_Sonex> If Woolie didn't want to listen and cheat then that's on him,
[3:37:50] <%captain_thickthighs> I wonder how that Saint ladie looks like now
[3:37:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @mywifeleftme_dot_mp4 The devs were shocked to go up and accept it XD
[3:38:05] <SirJotero> Well, now that you've fallen, you can meet Selen Vinland!
[3:38:06] <+Mitchellsocks> Farron Keep for me
[3:38:12] <%za7az> "Everyone betray me. I am fed up with this world. No one listens to Pat" KappaHD
[3:38:12] <Dao_Puppy> The gutter doesn't actually poison or slow you down...
[3:38:13] <+FoolsArcade> Gutter is so awful
[3:38:16] <%Adojim> @squirtkitten but he didn't get given a +10 estoc by a fan
[3:38:18] <%Aeogard> gutter is really cool conceptually though
[3:38:19] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Does the Gutter count as a swamp?
[3:38:20] <yficaptions> Bubblegoop swamp in Banjo Kappa
[3:38:22] <nmaten> the gutter sucks when you dont know where to go
[3:38:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I dunno, I think The Gutter is the least bad swamp
[3:38:24] <RyuuAoi> WOOLIE SWAMP HANDS DOWN
[3:38:26] <%moogleboy1984> "How about I snipe you from outside the draw distance?"
[3:38:29] <%Alazull> the Gutter had leaps of faith in the dark tho
[3:38:31] <blue8moon> I hate farron keep's stupid goatmen
[3:38:33] <+FoolsArcade> Gutter has shitty design, at least Farron Keep looks cool
[3:38:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Farron Keep is fine
[3:38:36] <%FacetiousAF> farron keep is... easy to get lost in.
[3:38:38] <Aydarkzero> it's those three torches you gotta go looking for that sucks
[3:38:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Blighttown OG sucks
[3:38:39] <Mangahero18> Oh yea Farran Swamp is SOOOO SLOW
[3:38:46] <DianaTheAscian> i got lost there so many times
[3:38:46] <%Monkeyweed21> what about the swamp in DS3 that does Toxic?
[3:38:47] <%The_UnfathoMarble> poison doesnt do much dmg, but it halves healing
[3:38:49] <Fefe41> I didn't like the Gutter, it felt so uninspired
[3:38:50] <+Mitchellsocks> Gutter's cut content is one of the coolest things in Souls
[3:38:50] <RyuuAoi> GRANDMA SWAMP TOP TIER @patstaresat
[3:38:51] <GameOver_Here> The Gutter isn't a swamp tho, it's just a bunch of houses on stilts
[3:38:54] <%KaiserMario> Can't
[3:38:58] <squirtkitten> @Adojim And? He wouldve used it if he did, he always talks about being overpowered in every game he palyed. He also grinded off screen to be above the level for each area
[3:38:58] <wolverinewaswrong> whats the best swamp tho
[3:38:58] <+Beckadora> Wat Farron Keep isnt that bad
[3:39:01] <%josstil> no meme. die
[3:39:01] <%Broken_Sonex> Is this what the Woolie Hole looks like?
[3:39:02] <+Mitchellsocks> Just want to go to the Gutter bar
[3:39:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> please, you can blow through farron keep in like five minutes
[3:39:06] <Overloard> did sekiro have a poopoo level?
[3:39:09] <UnsteadyFunk> I wonder if I'm alone, at least in the chat here, in that I've never played a single souls game for more than an hour. I bought Dark Souls on steam and tried playing it with a mouse and keyboard and the port was so bad I immediately uninstalled it.
[3:39:09] <%Aeogard> at least you have some ability to negate the bs in farron keep
[3:39:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gutter is easy to just skip a bunch of the area
[3:39:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Man the cut content in the Gutter is fuckin SICK!
[3:39:21] <cipher758> dank swamp
[3:39:21] <Aydarkzero> @Overloard it did actually haha
[3:39:22] <Mangahero18> Does scraping spear have any practical use in pve?
[3:39:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don'
[3:39:34] <Dao_Puppy> Farron keep is an oval that the map designer threw darts at.
[3:39:34] <%FacetiousAF> most people aren't fuckin speedrunning on their first 3 plays
[3:39:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hell, the cut content in ALL of DS2 is fucking cool
[3:39:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i don't see you blowing through this in five minutes
[3:39:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> @UnsteadyFunk Don't play with mouse and keyboard maybe
[3:39:39] <Aydarkzero> i need to see this cut content for the gutter
[3:39:47] <+StingtheKing> That wood breaking scared the shit out of me.
[3:39:51] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Farron Keep I always get that last fire running from elder ghrus by the skin of my teeth.
[3:39:52] <%Aeogard> @UnsteadyFunk yeah both kb/m and not using the DSFix mod makes it unplayable for original PC port
[3:39:58] <%Ynkubus_> @UnsteadyFunk that was probably the worst way to get into itIm afraid.
[3:39:58] <RyuuAoi> One Guy barking but not biting @patstaresat
[3:40:00] <Ner234> @squirtkitten I think Pat is more bothered by the fact that someone just gave Woolie the gear.
[3:40:03] <%za7az> @UnsteadyFunk It's a cardinal sin to play mouse and keyboard
[3:40:04] <%Broken_Sonex> @UnsteadyFunk Your first mistake was playing on PC
[3:40:05] <+Mitchellsocks> The biggest evil Farron Keep has is the huge pillar, because it looks like a wall and it kinda warps your perception of space
[3:40:11] <%ssjklyco> You can perfect eveygame really fast if you now what to do when to do it perfectly.
[3:40:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Magic sounds so cool
[3:40:14] <EuropanLamprey> You can't do farron keep in 5 minutes cause you have to snail it half the time
[3:40:24] <%Adojim> @squirtkitten he is usually pretty fair with weapons. he almost never uses stuff dropped for him. and the being "over leveled" is a joke of a complaint. he was about 20 levels under me when i played it. he just didn't get stomped the way fans wanted.
[3:40:27] <SirJotero> Selen Vinland should be squatting on one of these little islands
[3:40:32] <%captain_thickthighs> BTW yous guys should check out that ds2 light mod thats being worked o
[3:40:32] <squirtkitten> @Ner234 Whats the difference between being given it and getting the asme weapon by grinding off screen LUL
[3:40:34] <Mangahero18> I always use a fextralife map to make sure I get all the items in Farron Keep
[3:40:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's what she said
[3:40:38] <+Mitchellsocks> @EuropanLamprey Well there is the basically mandatory Dagger weapon art, but it still SUCKS
[3:40:39] <%Aeogard> even on ps3 the level is huge, that's why your visibility is 3 feet in front of you
[3:40:43] <%Anime_Flux> poop slugs?
[3:40:45] <DianaTheAscian> it looks cool at least
[3:40:48] <%moogleboy1984> yeahyeahyeah Valkyrie set
[3:40:48] <+CapnClassix> Is he not gonna grab the Moonlight Sword?
[3:40:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> I use the fextralife map to get all the essential items, that's it
[3:40:53] <+Beckadora> Forbidden Woods in Bloodborne is horrendous
[3:40:54] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt The Marrowstones you get from these guys increase Crit. Dmg. for pierce weapons, functions like the Leo Ring
[3:40:54] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, being able to see the wall paths in the distance is pretty cool
[3:41:00] <%Broken_Sonex> @squirtkitten The fact you got it YOURSELF
[3:41:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can just equip a knife that lets you dash in Farron keep and it totally negates the swamp
[3:41:15] <%heartlesshealer> corpse-blocked magic
[3:41:15] <%penitentpendant> I'd be nervous to light a flame in this area. I'd feel the explosion would engulf the whole of the cave.
[3:41:16] <dan_g_v> pew pee
[3:41:17] <Fefe41> Aww you didn't show off the stack of slugs hanging on the ceiling tho
[3:41:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[3:41:19] <%captain_thickthighs> Oh god imagine the smell
[3:41:20] <Ner234> @squirtkitten I guess it just feels different to some people if you actually work for it
[3:41:21] <%ssjklyco> Slug them in the face
[3:41:22] <JayPastaForce> Is this King Kong?
[3:41:24] <Overloard> neverending poop
[3:41:24] <+Mitchellsocks> @Beckadora I used to think that, but i really like the layout now that I understand how straightforward it is
[3:41:25] <jellssssss20> Where are these slugs flying in from
[3:41:26] <%ChestMimik> This is a hilarious amount of slugs
[3:41:38] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Beckadora Oh God every time I get to Forbidden Woods I feel like I've completely forgotten everything about it.
[3:41:39] <%penitentpendant> An infinite slug orgy above
[3:41:41] <$Damien_Kova> Didn't realize we were back in DS3
[3:41:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's funny how they just keep dropping
[3:41:42] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> creepy looking succ slugs
[3:41:45] <%Adojim> gross
[3:41:47] <Fefe41> They all chill on the cave ceiling up there
[3:41:47] <+BubbaRands> dats a lotta escargot
[3:41:48] <+dankwolf_chase> GO AND GET IT
[3:41:48] <BinaryShuffle> that mound is more slug than dirt
[3:41:56] <%heartlesshealer> slug farming?
[3:41:59] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt They do stop
[3:42:00] <dan_g_v> sucky sucky
[3:42:00] <squirtkitten> @Ner234 Yeah farming teh same handful of guys over and over is really working for it LUL I just dont understand the salt when Woolie was having fun
[3:42:05] <SirJotero> The slugs are infinite, Pat
[3:42:08] <+Jimboq> it's an all you can eat shit slug buffet
[3:42:10] <SirItGoBoomAlot> IT"S RAINING SLUGS, HALLELIGNUA oh man I don't know how to spell that

[3:42:39] <%heartlesshealer> go get those souls
[3:42:40] <dan_g_v> covered in sticky slime
[3:42:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I wonder if you casn break the game with all the dead slug physics
[3:42:41] <Overloard> really shit the bed there
[3:42:42] <GameOver_Here> FUCK THIS ZONE
[3:42:42] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @The_UnfathoMarble I laughed out loud at that thanks.
[3:42:43] <+dankwolf_chase> Pat, look above for guidance
[3:42:47] <blewlamb> its up
[3:42:48] <+Mitchellsocks> I love how the Moonlight is just in a shitpile
[3:42:48] <%Alazull> hallelujah
[3:42:49] <+klooswep> It's important to die at least once there, slugs are weak against salt
[3:42:50] <+twohitgood> don't you have to cut the whole clump down from the top?
[3:42:50] <Jack8274> You have to knock it down up top
[3:42:54] <%ssjklyco> Snail orgy Snorgy
[3:42:55] <%josstil> gotta love the swamp
[3:42:55] <dan_g_v> gotta dump the mass, no?
[3:43:00] <jellssssss20> Do items stay dropped after you die or what happens tothem?
[3:43:00] <nilla_24> you have to cut them from above
[3:43:00] <%Aeogard> GET DAT SWARD BAYBEEE
[3:43:01] <+dankwolf_chase> It's at the top.
[3:43:03] <SirJotero> @PatStaresAt To get the sword, you need to climb some scaffolding and cut the slug's nest from above
[3:43:06] <%heartlesshealer> up first, then down to slugs
[3:43:10] <+twohitgood> it's up top and you cut the whole thing down.
[3:43:11] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt You have to kill the slug nest
[3:43:14] <%collind99> You gotta knock it down first
[3:43:15] <%moogleboy1984> Shrine of Amana is the worst swamp
[3:43:19] <+dankwolf_chase> Go around the left.
[3:43:20] <islandoasis> whats up pat you big fucking loser hero
[3:43:26] <Slim_Lipid> TOP is FED
[3:43:31] <Deadmanslegacy> how far from astrea?
[3:43:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> dig up stupid
[3:43:37] <Fefe41> You were heading to the nest until you dropped from the catwalk
[3:43:38] <jellssssss20> Gotta get up to get down
[3:43:39] <Jack8274> In the third part, you go left instead of right
[3:43:55] <yficaptions> so what kind of haptic feedback are you getting from the swamp?
[3:43:56] <Srthunda> yup
[3:43:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> breath-taking
[3:44:00] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @moogleboy1984 I don't think it counts as a swamp unless you get poisoned via traversal.
[3:44:01] <%Monkeyweed21> visibility exists now
[3:44:02] <+CapnClassix> IT was practiocally pitch black in the old one
[3:44:06] <%heartlesshealer> looks great for a dark area
[3:44:07] <+CapnClassix> just like candles in the distance
[3:44:07] <%SirGO0SE> all the better to see the poopoo
[3:44:09] <Jack8274> It used to be strait up PS2 silent hill fog on the PS3
[3:44:10] <Fefe41> Back then you could only see the item glows in the distance to guide you
[3:44:16] <jellssssss20> The shrine of Amana enemies are the worst parts
[3:44:16] <islandoasis> is he in 5-2? getting the istelle and the moonlight sword?
[3:44:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> The sillhouette of that guy looked badass
[3:44:26] <%Anime_Flux> Haptic feedback lets you feel the poop clumps rubbing past your thighs
[3:44:35] <SovPho> more like demon's soles right send feet pics
[3:44:40] <%moogleboy1984> @VvTacoSaladvV Coutner Argument: The Gutter
[3:44:52] <%SirGO0SE> @Anime_Flux I felt corn PogChamp
[3:44:57] <Fefe41> Istarelle is in 5-1
[3:44:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> fire gun
[3:45:01] <%KaiserMario> LUL He hadn't noticed you until you shot him
[3:45:02] <%captain_thickthighs> @SovPho Get out of here Tarantino
[3:45:03] <BinaryShuffle> pyro magic go BRRRRR
[3:45:03] <%heartlesshealer> maybe heal
[3:45:06] <SovPho> jesus that wendy's ad felt like a lifetime
[3:45:16] <%Aeogard> anyone else look at the Maiden in Black's feet in this game
[3:45:19] <islandoasis> did they buff that istrelle spear? it was barely usable in des og
[3:45:21] <BinaryShuffle> LUL
[3:45:24] <jellssssss20> If you assume evry pool in the Gutter has a snake until you kill it it's okay
[3:45:24] <JayPastaForce> ????
[3:45:25] <blewlamb> LUL
[3:45:25] <%GingaNZ> nice
[3:45:27] <SovPho> @SovPho It's pronounced Dan "Two Fingers In Side Her" Schnider
[3:45:31] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:45:32] <hassanico2> @SovPho 30 second ads is fucked dude
[3:45:33] <RyuuAoi> GOD BLESS @patstaresat FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT IN MY RATCHET ASS TOWN
[3:45:48] <%collind99> FUCK
[3:45:49] <%KaiserMario> Good job Pat, you're the best player in the world WR
[3:45:58] <islandoasis> Dan "Parry a Child" Schnider
[3:45:59] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @moogleboy1984 I guess Shrine of Amana and The Gutter are both honorary swamp levels. Though the Gutter isn't really swampy until Black Gulch.
[3:46:01] <SovPho> @hassanico2 I'll eat an ad for my ginger boi
[3:46:11] <%ChestMimik> Whoever made the "Footsteps filled with poopjuice" sound effect deserves a raise
[3:46:20] <RyuuAoi> @islandoasis FUCK DEM KIDS
[3:46:23] <SirJotero> @islandoasis The numerical side of the game is almost completely the same. I doubt they buffed the Istarelle. :c
[3:46:29] <%Broken_Sonex> Pat, you're the biggest Loser- Hero there ever was.
[3:46:33] <%Anime_Flux> this is the stage that just keeps giving
[3:46:34] <jellssssss20> Oh I fully assumed the black gulch was the gutter, there's also all that bullshit isn't there
[3:46:37] <Fefe41> This level becomes doubly dreadful when you see how people actually live here
[3:46:45] <+santafer> next is leechmonger right? That and the colossus were easy I think
[3:47:03] <+TheBitingIrish> You had one foot in like 3 inches of swamp
[3:47:05] <%Monkeyweed21> already did Leechmonger
[3:47:10] <islandoasis> @SirJotero rip, i remember trying to force that spear on my first playthrough and having an awful time
[3:47:13] <SirJotero> @santafer Leechmonger is 5-1; Dirty Colossus is this one.
[3:47:16] <jellssssss20> How and why do people actually live here
[3:47:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dirty Colossus is next and both are super weak to fire
[3:47:24] <+Mitchellsocks> Did he respec Magic meter into health?
[3:47:24] <+santafer> ah ok, thanks
[3:47:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is the one in the open area with flies and you burn off by walking into the torches
[3:47:42] <+TheBitingIrish> UberGoglins monkaS
[3:47:46] <%captain_thickthighs> Did he fight Gael yet?
[3:47:49] <+TheBitingIrish> goglins... ffs
[3:47:54] <2deep5u> is he going to beat the game today?
[3:47:58] <%Anime_Flux> some sort of gobbo-lin
[3:47:58] <SovPho> did they take these spells out of the rest of the games because they're broken as shit
[3:48:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just a small one
[3:48:02] <+hoenhime344> are we in the valley?
[3:48:02] <jellssssss20> Just a regular man
[3:48:03] <+santafer> The only good goblin is a dead goblin
[3:48:03] <%Adojim> his catalyst halves mp for greater damage
[3:48:03] <2deep5u> there isn't much left
[3:48:09] <+cgreene64> I stepped away, why is Pat's magic bar so low now?
[3:48:12] <SovPho> because that's broken as shit
[3:48:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I rather like the sound of goglins actuakky
[3:48:26] <+CannonHeroBrett> @captain_thickthighs the ds3 boss?
[3:48:28] <Fefe41> He got the insanity catalyst which halves his MP
[3:48:36] <%Adojim> insanity catalyst halves it or something @cgreene64
[3:48:40] <$Raikouija> huh
[3:48:42] <%Anime_Flux> lol
[3:48:43] <%FacetiousAF> on god?!
[3:48:43] <%SirGO0SE> hap dicks
[3:48:44] <SirJotero> @cgreene64 He's using the Insanity Catalyst, which halves MP but boosts damage.
[3:48:44] <%josstil> oh
[3:48:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> how
[3:48:46] <$Raikouija> oh dear
[3:48:46] <+deviljhojho_> oh no no no
[3:48:47] <%Aeogard> POISON RUMBLE Pogchamp
[3:48:48] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[3:48:52] <garbageheaphound> thats something
[3:48:53] <SovPho> is... is that good?
[3:48:54] <+A0N33> That's impressive
[3:48:56] <%ClericOfSparda> Daaaaang
[3:48:56] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> thats cool
[3:48:56] <%FacetiousAF> so the DeS remake is incredible?
[3:48:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[3:48:57] <$Raikouija> THat's just being a dick with the meta
[3:49:02] <+Pharmakokinetic> is it time for the moonlight greatsword
[3:49:04] <Make_me_mad> So what you're saying is, as always, you should just turn off vibration in every game you play.
[3:49:08] <%josstil> actual physical poison
[3:49:08] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit haptic is getting too much
[3:49:08] <%RyTYoung> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:49:10] <%Broken_Sonex> All the more reason to not get poisoned
[3:49:10] <+cgreene64> @Adojim @SirJotero Awesome thank you
[3:49:11] <+taltalheights> I've seen some art that implies the are some intriguing goblins
[3:49:13] <Slim_Lipid> Don't you love it when games feel bad to play LUL
[3:49:15] <RyuuAoi> Like the Sonia
[3:49:17] <%moogleboy1984> can't wait for Resident Evil to use the haptic for your heartbeat as a health meter
[3:49:25] <islandoasis> i feel like the new fancy triggers are gonna get worn down quickly
[3:49:26] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Man I never even found this area.
[3:49:30] <%captain_thickthighs> @CannonHeroBrett Sri I meant Garl the squid head dude
[3:49:33] <islandoasis> just a guess
[3:49:38] <RyuuAoi> Like sonic underwater music
[3:49:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Insanity Catalyst increases magic damage while halving your MP. Pat is going full magic damage buffs
[3:49:48] <Jack8274> Uh we still have to hit enemies Pat
[3:49:48] <Fefe41> Das a good point actually
[3:49:56] <jellssssss20> Will you be fighting Doland?
[3:49:59] <Fefe41> Slug orgy yeyeye
[3:49:59] <%josstil> oh no
[3:50:12] <Fefe41> You gotta chop it pat
[3:50:14] <%Anime_Flux> ewwww
[3:50:14] <+Jimboq> gross DansGame
[3:50:20] <islandoasis> stick ur penor in it
[3:50:20] <%josstil> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:50:24] <%ssjklyco> Look at that snorgie
[3:50:26] <+SolidusRex> The quality of life stuff and general gameplay improvements and haptic controller stuff, all of this looks amazing so far. Some of the design choices, music choices, and voice acting direction thus far though? Yeesh.
[3:50:28] <+santafer> the yeerks are bigger than I remember
[3:50:29] <%FacetiousAF> whack the sack
[3:50:30] <Slim_Lipid> Juicy üëÖ
[3:50:36] <%ChestMimik> I don't think real slugs do that but I'm no biologist
[3:50:43] <%Monkeyweed21> dingleberry
[3:50:43] <@commanderclaw> Who doesn't like a good slug bouquet?
[3:50:45] <islandoasis> they do
[3:50:51] <%ssjklyco> Try it
[3:50:51] <islandoasis> but they do it when mating
[3:50:57] <jellssssss20> @santafer +1 for the animorphs joke
[3:50:58] <Jack8274> There weas a shortcut drop down
[3:50:59] <Jack8274> On the left
[3:51:03] <%Laecerelius> Slug fuck pile
[3:51:05] <+twohitgood> i don't get it. if they'd thrive here, woudn't it be the last place they'd drop it?
[3:51:05] <GameOver_Here> Do you get a torch in this game?
[3:51:06] <%ChestMimik> @islandoasis Thanks I hate it
[3:51:07] <+CannonHeroBrett> @CannonHeroBrett I dont think so but i could be wrong
[3:51:09] <%Adojim> so it is a giant slug orgy
[3:51:16] <Make_me_mad> Real slugs do that, but only while you're sleeping, and only directly above your mouth.
[3:51:22] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, slugs climb trees to fuck
[3:51:26] <%josstil> this is fine
[3:51:30] <%captain_thickthighs> This whole level wants me to grab so e lysol
[3:51:39] <SirJotero> Well, the lore reason for the Moonlight Sword's location is that a bunch of clerics and knights made pilgrimage to the Valley
[3:51:45] <Jack8274> Look at the walls
[3:51:46] <%Anime_Flux> it's pretty icky
[3:51:46] <+CannonHeroBrett> Dooky pit
[3:51:47] <%Monkeyweed21> its just poop
[3:51:48] <%Punchasaur> its like a rat king but slug
[3:51:53] <GameOver_Here> The darkness adds to the gross
[3:51:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wait wasn't there a thing you were supposed to knock down to connect back to the archstone?
[3:51:55] <+idyota> which souls game has the best swamp?
[3:51:56] <RubberFistFight> it's worse than anything in any of the previous from games
[3:51:58] <Jack8274> They literally have shit flowing down them in spots
[3:52:00] <%Laecerelius> You can even see the bits of corn!
[3:52:00] <%GingaNZ> yeah its nasty
[3:52:02] <%Aeogard> it really is the grossest
[3:52:03] <+KingNoodleWalrus> really makes you fell like you're wading through centuries of rotting sewage, yeah
[3:52:04] <DianaTheAscian> this place sucks
[3:52:07] <Overloard> poopoo dial turned to 11
[3:52:09] <RubberFistFight> it's offiically worse than the maggot-fly area of Dark Souls 3's DLC @PatStaresAt
[3:52:10] <$Raikouija> like a hole of some sorts?.... Kappa
[3:52:10] <+santafer> Blightown was a slum in a swamp, this is literally a shithole
[3:52:12] <%Anime_Flux> uh oh
[3:52:12] <almightygowther> You reckon this place smells worse the Blight Town?
[3:52:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt blighttown is just kind of gross poison whereas this is shit blood water and aborted fetuses
[3:52:18] <%Anime_Flux> not like this
[3:52:18] <huskarl_zap> they eat de poopoo
[3:52:18] <%Broken_Sonex> It's the most accurate representation of the Woolie Hole thus far
[3:52:22] <%captain_thickthighs> So how flammable is all that methane
[3:52:23] <%penitentpendant> Again, with all the lit flames around I'm surprised this place hasn't exploded
[3:52:26] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Punchasaur There was an age of Man, an Age of Rat, and finally...the Age of Slug.
[3:52:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> If yuo die before picking it up it's gone forever?
[3:52:27] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Slugs have orgies after climbing trees. Also, slugs are hermaphrodites
[3:52:31] <2deep5u> item shiny, slug like
[3:52:31] <islandoasis> @PatStaresAt you ever gonna tackle the kings field/shadow tower?
[3:52:32] <+taltalheights> Reminds me of porta potties at music festivals
[3:52:34] <%ssjklyco> I feel like in reality you would not want to use any fire in this swamp as it looks like it will catch fire from all the methane.
[3:52:39] <%Aeogard> Aoh yeah i forgot about the baby fetuses here too
[3:52:43] <huskarl_zap> you literal pieces of sgut slugs
[3:52:43] <JayPastaForce> who will win, pat's fire or slugs under the poop water
[3:52:46] <+santafer> pew pew
[3:52:50] <%Monkeyweed21> SEATH TURNED INTO SLUGS

[3:53:04] <Blank9> king's field 4 is the only good ing's field
[3:53:06] <%GingaNZ> did that always have an animation?

[3:54:08] <%ChestMimik> Moonlight Glock
[3:54:09] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Shit I thought you had to craft it...it's just sitting here in the poop swamp?
[3:54:10] <@commanderclaw> Jesus loved him some greatswords
[3:54:12] <SirJotero> @CommanderSqueaks The logic is that the slugs like glowing things. That's why they're drawn to the phosphorescent water in 4-2.
[3:54:13] <huskarl_zap> Fantasy armor core should exist
[3:54:14] <hassanico2> Yeah except we know who G O D God is in this game, don't we? Kappa
[3:54:14] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Thanks Pat! Still my favorite weapon in Demon's Souls!

[3:55:14] <%Punchasaur> demons souls was bibble gaem all along
[3:55:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> In the Dark Souls 3 LP you said Anri had the first mention of children in the series but this lady talks about her kids
[3:55:19] <+idyota> does she really have a child?
[3:55:22] <+twohitgood> only character that sells the halberd
[3:55:23] <Jack8274> And the grains
[3:55:24] <Deadmanslegacy> oh my God the flies
[3:55:24] <%captain_thickthighs> Wait wait wouldn't there be some plant life with all that poop?
[3:55:25] <+Adalore> such great characters in this game, classics like "Filthy woman"
[3:55:26] <+waltzqueen> is this Patches' mom? sounds like peole hate her, must be a reason
[3:55:32] <%penitentpendant> She has some weirdly rare items
[3:55:33] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt which do you think smells worse this place or blight town
[3:55:34] <+twohitgood> her face looks so dire
[3:55:34] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Lorewise, what do the Moonlight Greatswords have in common?
[3:55:34] <+hoenhime344> kill her
[3:55:36] <%heartlesshealer> rotten arrows hell yeah

[3:55:46] <%WhereIsWill> omega tier escort mission: get lady out of poo poo lands
[3:55:49] <Fefe41> You never see the child and it's implied the child was long dead and she's delusional
[3:55:50] <RyuuAoi> $20 will buy you a new game on the switch @patstaresat
[3:55:58] <%Doruben> the moon
[3:56:01] <%penitentpendant> Their design, is about it
[3:56:01] <Jack8274> They look cool *shrug*
[3:56:04] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @SirKeigan Here's a trip: In the original (except NA version), she mentions the "Virgin Mary." This has serious lore implications.
[3:56:08] <+Adalore> A sick motif, that's what the moonlight greatsword has.
[3:56:09] <jellssssss20> The next few aren't relics of GOD
[3:56:09] <%Laecerelius> It's a thing FromSoft has been doing for like a long time
[3:56:10] <DianaTheAscian> they do magic stuff
[3:56:11] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt Lore wise they look cool
[3:56:11] <jellssssss20> ?
[3:56:15] <+CannonHeroBrett> @TrollKing96 just callbacks to kingsfield
[3:56:15] <devanmuse> it's like how every final fantasy has a guy named Cid in them
[3:56:16] <islandsunn> they all glow
[3:56:18] <$Raikouija> @TrollKing96 Its just the From Software Easter Egg tbh, they all look the same but different origin
[3:56:19] <%Taisuru> Don't forget Moonlight is in fucking Armored COre as well
[3:56:20] <islandoasis> moonlight gs in demon souls was just a reference jsut like how chocobos are in every ff
[3:56:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> @VvTacoSaladvV *parks and rec Oh face*
[3:56:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mostly Seath, since King's Field at least
[3:56:31] <islandsunn> can't believe we didn't get a moonlight greatsword in sekiro
[3:56:33] <+twohitgood> seath was associated with the sword in DS1 and king's field but that's about it.
[3:56:33] <Deadmanslegacy> they're all greenish-blue...
[3:56:38] <huskarl_zap> i cant remember any lore other than what Hugo says about it
[3:56:43] <Blank9> the original moonlight greatsword was even part of a pair with the dark slayer sword, each made by dragon gods
[3:56:47] <islandoasis> dark souls is when they started doing BIG nods to the lore from king's field
[3:56:49] <+CannonHeroBrett> @TrollKing96 They just made it a thing
[3:56:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is Seath referenced in DS3 at all?
[3:56:51] <Jack8274> Without poise they are a bitch up close
[3:56:51] <%ChestMimik> But how does this game connect to Armored Core
[3:56:53] <Blank9> but they don't bring the dark slayer back
[3:56:57] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is this abortion zone?
[3:57:07] <Fefe41> The villagers just want to live a peaceful life
[3:57:13] <%FacetiousAF> @tusk102 this is taco bell land
[3:57:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @islandsunn The Divine Dragon sorta has one, at least
[3:57:32] <+twohitgood> the dark slayer was associated with guyra who wasn't brought back but resembles kalameet.
[3:57:39] <%captain_thickthighs> Der god I miss armored core
[3:57:39] <%collind99> Did I miss the fetus thing
[3:57:40] <%Anime_Flux> Combo!
[3:57:41] <dan_g_v> happiest place in vole
[3:57:44] <%collind99> Ok
[3:57:48] <%Fooguwu> can we stop at mcdoland on the way to abortion land patrick
[3:57:48] <+twohitgood> so maybe you could say the obsidian greatsword is dark slayer.
[3:57:49] <dan_g_v> boletaria even
[3:57:50] <%VvTacoSaladvV> People said DS3 was just a fanservice game as if they all weren't just fanservice to King's Field to begin with.
[3:57:51] <Overloard> i cant live a normal life, i was BORN in the poop
[3:57:57] <huskarl_zap> you dont even see them if you kill garl
[3:57:57] <islandoasis> cant wait to see pat in his natural element, and thats curbstomping babies
[3:57:59] <%ChestMimik> @twohitgood The vtuber?
[3:58:03] <%Taisuru> @ChestMimik Armored core is the plink between DeS and Dark Souls
[3:58:09] <Jack8274> Unlock the shortcut
[3:58:16] <Jack8274> Unless your big dicking this boss
[3:58:19] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat My PAYPAL stays open. Beat it by midnight, and the $20 is yours. Lose and you pay the price. Deal? Let's make this interesting.
[3:58:23] <+rsg220> so whats the build?
[3:58:24] <+taltalheights> Always hated getting the shortcut at the end, mainly realizing i worked so hard for a 2x4.
[3:58:30] <SirJotero> I want to see fan art of the Valley inhabitants wearing the "I <3 Hole" shirt from Dorohedoro
[3:58:34] <+twohitgood> @ChestMimik i'm gonna say no because i don't know who you're talking about.
[3:58:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> @rsg220 Magic glass cannon
[3:58:58] <%Punchasaur> you merely adopted the pop. i was born in it.
[3:58:58] <+rsg220> @SirKeigan word
[3:59:03] <SovPho> ethical analyses SUCKS
[3:59:03] <%Punchasaur> pop
[3:59:08] <%Punchasaur> POOP
[3:59:11] <huskarl_zap> molded by it
[3:59:16] <%WhereIsWill> this place is AWFUL
[3:59:16] <Jack8274> Where that sign was is the shortcut
[3:59:22] <islandoasis> did you drink the poo water? oooo thats not good
[3:59:23] <Overloard> the only reason demonslayer can manage this is because he's already half dead
[3:59:28] <xander9352> Man, it's been ages since I caught Pat streaming. How's it going?
[3:59:31] <+twohitgood> @SovPho why?
[3:59:44] <%ChestMimik> @twohitgood I misread Guyra as Gawr
[3:59:47] <+taltalheights> Glad to see other Dorohedoro fans in the wild
[3:59:48] <SovPho> @twohitgood tedious tbh
[3:59:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> It makes sense
[4:00:01] <%Aeogard> its one of the best shortcuts in souls games imo
[4:00:01] <Jack8274> When I see bloodstains on it I always poor one out
[4:00:14] <%GingaNZ> the shortest cut
[4:00:15] <mar_krow> Pop pop
[4:00:28] <+twohitgood> @ChestMimik ahh. nope. not gwar, either.
[4:00:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel myself going into septic shock just looking at this filth.
[4:00:29] <+OotsyMahDootsie> @Jack8274 lmao
[4:00:31] <+kamikazekripple> out of mp
[4:00:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I imagine the shortcut area was built first then they built the rest of it
[4:00:38] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Is this shortcut worth it. I always get frustrated at the big guys and just run the last stretch so I miss like 80% of this level.
[4:01:17] <%Aeogard> shortcut is worth if you're doing 100% of the level and its stuff, otherwise you can run through easier
[4:01:18] <Fefe41> I like the 2-2 shortcut most, gets you straight to the boss
[4:01:18] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat COWARD. FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY.
[4:01:33] <%WhereIsWill> he kicked the shit outta that wood LUL
[4:01:38] <%captain_thickthighs> Time for planned parenthood?
[4:01:47] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I've never died to Dirty Colossus so I guess it's never come up.
[4:01:52] <Jack8274> Tons of resources
[4:01:57] <islandoasis> you cant shortcut your way to my heart
[4:01:59] <+twohitgood> @Fefe41 no thank you to souls platforming.
[4:02:13] <Jack8274> It's manditory for faith builds to farm here BibleThump
[4:02:26] <Jack8274> Those damn slugs
[4:02:36] <ranarath> @Jack8274 What do they drop?
[4:02:36] <%WhereIsWill> always good stuff in the swamps. Source: pyromancer main

[4:02:53] <+rsg220> what a battle
[4:02:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Poop gun vs fire gun
[4:02:56] <Aydarkzero> yep
[4:02:57] <%captain_thickthighs> @Jack8274 I feel there's a metaphor in there
[4:02:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Punchasaur LUL
[4:02:58] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[4:02:58] <%josstil> wow

[4:03:01] <%arcielardor> holy fuck
[4:03:02] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt what do you think of the philosophy that the zone is the real boss and the boss is just a winning lap
[4:03:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GUN
[4:03:03] <WakeUpThrow> Poor Pinwheel
[4:03:04] <Deadmanslegacy> um
[4:03:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> the foul boy is down
[4:03:05] <+santafer> Just like I remember
[4:03:06] <$KnivesEve> wait i look away for second
[4:03:06] <morethantwo> magic is so busted
[4:03:08] <islandoasis> zzz
[4:03:09] <%AFlyingTaco1> This thing and the leechmonger are just so nothing
[4:03:09] <dan_g_v> too hard
[4:03:10] <+Adalore> rofl
[4:03:10] <islandsunn> what a bitch
[4:03:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Magic is so busted
[4:03:14] <KasiCrafter> Dirty tactics for a dirty boss
[4:03:17] <+Tragosavich> The power of GUN
[4:03:18] <kammerdood> DSP race
[4:03:19] <0rond> man watching this game for the first time and bro there really are too many fucking knights in dark souls
[4:03:19] <islandoasis> i alt tabbed for a bit and its gone
[4:03:21] <Fefe41> Colossus is the easiest in the game
[4:03:21] <Jack8274> @captain_thickthighs Tis our penance
[4:03:22] <blue8moon> Okay, this is the middle boss, I could only remember the leechmonger and astraee
[4:03:24] <DianaTheAscian> literal poop monster
[4:03:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, now napalm the entire zone, it's the only way to be sure.
[4:03:26] <Slim_Lipid> Yes it is LUL
[4:03:28] <+KENTASHIRO> everything is busted in Demons
[4:03:29] <Deadmanslegacy> a shit boss for a shit zone
[4:03:30] <$Raikouija> So because you are slaughtering Demons in this game, does this mean Technically this is the most "Not-Berserk" Game of the Miyazaki games? Kappa
[4:03:35] <+Adalore> to be far the word of mouth I have heard is that bosses are not hard in this game, it's the zones on the way there that kills you.
[4:03:40] <hassanico2> Dirty Colossus is lamer than fucking Vanguard
[4:03:41] <+Adalore> well "GENERALLY" not hard.
[4:03:45] <Jack8274> 5-3 is a joke honestly, if you can parry
[4:03:47] <Overloard> the real boss is the level
[4:03:48] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The bosses in World 5 are easy because the levels are so hard.
[4:03:48] <PkSilent01> I miss the orginal dirty Colossus theme
[4:03:48] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Do you want the $20 or not? You can beat it by midnight. $20 = 1bottle of Effen Vodka
[4:03:48] <%Monkeyweed21> What is it with Miyazaki and barefoot, blindfolded girls
[4:03:51] <hassanico2> Also time to hear how they FUCKING BUTCHERED Astraea's theme
[4:03:51] <Clundy> Magic The Gathering IS busted
[4:03:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a poop golem, whaddya expect spyCappa
[4:03:54] <%captain_thickthighs> Magic by definition is op
[4:03:56] <SovPho> That tracking shit is way, way better than any soul missile attack but just shit damage.
[4:03:58] <+buffn99> Valley has easy bosses, annoying level
[4:04:02] <kammerdood> it's cute when Pat talks shit about a game that's kicked his ass for years
[4:04:06] <%arcielardor> oh I thought you were fighting the final boss of the shadowlords
[4:04:08] <%Garthunox> try that shit against penetrator and see how far you get, magic is good, but it aint busted
[4:04:09] <islandoasis> bosses are alot less developed in des than in ds
[4:04:12] <i_am_therydon> just farming i think?
[4:04:24] <ranarath> Bosses are either piss easy or kick your ass 20 times. This game has no middle road.
[4:04:30] <islandoasis> they are more bullshit in some places like maneaters
[4:04:34] <%coastingtoast> pat just farted for sure
[4:04:40] <+Spoon_fresh> I just beat Yakuza Kiwami 1, and i cant beleive they put amazing grace in the credit sequence
[4:04:44] <+buffn99> @Garthunox No its still busted lol. You can easily 1 shot him with just homing soul arrow
[4:04:45] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat TAKE THE DEAL
[4:04:53] <%ChestMimik> How come Dark Souls gets to be abbreviated DS and not Demon Souls?
[4:04:55] <islandsunn> @islandoasis and WAAAAAY less developed than bloodborne and sekiro
[4:04:58] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @ranarath Basically, the bosses are easy or they're the maneaters.
[4:05:06] <+taltalheights> Pat's gotta take a Dirty Colossus
[4:05:09] <Spartan3909> Stonefang tunnel on an official.
[4:05:22] <Clundy> Pat had a poop toot
[4:05:36] <+Adalore> this is a sick afk screen.
[4:05:57] <+twohitgood> @PatStaresAt gloves drop from 2-1 from the official on the other side of hte broken bridge. (per: fextra)
[4:06:03] <%Punchasaur> now we can finally answer the age old question.. who is more annoying, mila jovovich or handler?
[4:06:13] <islandoasis> mila
[4:06:15] <%YakumoYomi> @ChestMimik I guess because Dark Souls was the most well known? Most people in the Souls community, however, seem to use DkS for Dark Souls and DeS for Demon's Souls
[4:06:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why do you quit game every time?
[4:06:35] <islandoasis> mila ruined multiple capocom movie ips wheres handler ruined only one
[4:06:46] <%YakumoYomi> Mila won't go away, while Handler is likely contained to World
[4:06:58] <%captain_thickthighs> Damn how close is that bathroom??
[4:07:05] <%Punchasaur> good reasons
[4:07:06] <Daxalog> You guys see the monster hunter movie palico?
[4:07:10] <Overloard> i thought the distinction between the two was DaS and DeS
[4:07:18] <%sirthomas2step> get on board the souuuuuul train
[4:07:18] <%Adojim> its just the corner of the room
[4:07:20] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @YakumoYomi I prefer abbreviating Dark Souls as just DS and the number: DS1, DS2...and Demon's Souls as DeS.
[4:07:22] <+Adalore> world tendency causes such doofy player behavior.
[4:07:24] <%YakumoYomi> Those load times are sexy
[4:07:25] <islandoasis> @captain_thickthighs what do yuo mean cap? he's in his bathroom right now
[4:07:26] <PkSilent01> @Daxalog no what does it look like
[4:07:33] <islandsunn> it has to be DS for DS1, 2 , 3
[4:07:34] <%Anime_Flux> I refuse to acknowledge there will be a MH movie. REFUSE.
[4:07:39] <rosemon5001> honestly i hope they dont start to "balance" for pvp because hoooly shit how it ruined ds3 forcing pvp standards to regular gameplay was ass
[4:07:40] <%Aeogard> DS is dark souls, DeS is demon's souls sillies
[4:07:45] <Daxalog> Kinda lanky and not cute
[4:07:46] <%sirthomas2step> huh?
[4:07:49] <islandsunn> defeat the boss with the power of positive thinking
[4:07:51] <hassanico2> Let's hear her shitty awful remix
[4:07:52] <Fefe41> There's a trophy for not killing Garl iirc
[4:07:55] <%captain_thickthighs> O
[4:07:56] <Slim_Lipid> God imagine if you have to beat Fatalis to get to the Mila Colab LUL
[4:07:57] <+twohitgood> you gonna go for the achievement now or for next run?
[4:08:03] <KasiCrafter> Time to persecute some homeless!
[4:08:08] <DianaTheAscian> oh that boss
[4:08:09] <+DazedCookies> It's ok MHW acknowledges the movie for you :)
[4:08:11] <%VvTacoSaladvV> As long as everyone agrees to never use the phrase "soulsbornekiro."
[4:08:18] <islandoasis> fatalis was fun, very good send off i feel
[4:08:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> I gotta go pee but I wanna see the plague babies

[4:09:31] <Overloard> nah
[4:09:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> That guy just fell off the branch lol

[4:09:52] <Ner234> BabyRage
[4:09:52] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Adalore To paraphrase Tim Rogers "All souls games could just be called King's Field-Likes. But King's Field is a Doom clone, so therefore Dark Souls is a Doom Clone."
[4:09:53] <%Aeogard> I really, really dislike how they handled this theme
[4:09:53] <%Garthunox> Would if i could bitch

[4:10:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so whats her deal?
[4:10:34] <%Monkeyweed21> So does she just have an intense scat feitsh?
[4:10:39] <%collind99> What‚Äôs the lore behind the babies?
[4:10:44] <Parapattern> Mind ya business
[4:10:44] <%sirthomas2step> i want the bodies to stand up and do the harlem shake
[4:10:46] <rosemon5001> infinite baby works
[4:10:49] <Theyre_everywhere> B A B Y H A N D S
[4:10:55] <%Chatterbox1991> X PLAGUED X
[4:11:02] <+Adalore> Depends on what makes it "impure"
[4:11:06] <%captain_thickthighs> This is what the catholic church invisioned
[4:11:06] <%Aeogard> shes the biggest demon of all
[4:11:06] <%ChestMimik> Impure as a nice demon or evil human?
[4:11:07] <%Anime_Flux> corrpupted by feces
[4:11:09] <count1999> @PatStaresAt she became a demon from what i remember
[4:11:10] <%Alazull> well yeah she's living in filth
[4:11:10] <+CannonHeroBrett> LUL
[4:11:11] <islandoasis> GET BABIED
[4:11:11] <Slim_Lipid> Nun Corruption Kreygasm
[4:11:12] <%arcielardor> oof
[4:11:12] <%Anime_Flux> *corrupted even
[4:11:12] <+Jimboq> BabyRage
[4:11:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Man fuck those babies
[4:11:14] <%josstil> baby stun lcok
[4:11:14] <%toastybites> She's too kinky
[4:11:14] <+deviljhojho_> nice
[4:11:15] <Gorgs7> that was weird, you literally went "Hoh-ha" just as a random npc called Hohha showed up on my screen
[4:11:16] <+CapnClassix> She realized the truth of "God" and became disillusioned
[4:11:17] <%WhereIsWill> pat tryin to choese
[4:11:19] <%Aeogard> biggest milkers that is
[4:11:20] <Sol_Install> baby pats being the shit out of pat
[4:11:20] <+Jaysky> Perhaps she's impure from sitting in the plague ridden meat and blood for years?
[4:11:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt she is impure bc feces most likely
[4:11:22] <%Monkeyweed21> She has a REALLY intense scat fetish @PatStaresAt
[4:11:30] <+buffn99> Shes an archdemon
[4:11:34] <Overloard> bodied by bloody boiled babies
[4:11:37] <%Garthunox> Would an impure demon imply that she's good, in a way?
[4:11:39] <$Raikouija> ohhhhh
[4:11:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i think she soothes them by literally feeding them souls basically
[4:11:43] <Dao_Puppy> Those are HUGE fetuses.
[4:11:44] <morethantwo> down the ol' fetus hole
[4:11:46] <Ashenik1> But what does it mean to be a Demon?
[4:11:49] <%ssjklyco> Are they her Fetus'?
[4:11:49] <SirJotero> Pat, why are you running through the swamp instead of taking the perfectly safe path to the left?
[4:11:53] <+ZoltanBMagnus> This feels like that berserk arc with the religious zealots
[4:11:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> Might be a "papa nurgle" situation
[4:11:54] <+CapnClassix> She technically is good
[4:11:55] <count1999> @PatStaresAt also why do you kill yourself everytime you get your body back?
[4:11:56] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> She's trying to heal these outcast people but yeah shit is fucked
[4:11:57] <ammobasket> Mmmm, most impure = least demonic?
[4:11:58] <Parapattern> She's using her demon soul to try to suck in all the evil of the land
[4:12:01] <Make_me_mad> Maybe she's impure because she's keeping all of these things alive with her power instead of letting them die.
[4:12:01] <%Anime_Flux> keeper of the abortatorium
[4:12:01] <+Adalore> So it could be impure because she wasn't doing what a magnificent demon is suppose to do.
[4:12:03] <theanora1> maybe not in HP
[4:12:04] <Slim_Lipid> Just guzzlin' that diarrhea so the villagers don't have to be in it
[4:12:07] <%arcielardor> roll
[4:12:08] <CrimsonFox777> Remember chat, for every abortion you have, the fetus gets sent here. Or churned into stem cells. I forget which.
[4:12:09] <SovPho> Stompin babies, stompin babies
[4:12:09] <%sirthomas2step> what a waste that's good eating
[4:12:09] <+CapnClassix> Because she's trying to ease the suffering of the abandoned
[4:12:10] <islandsunn> what is he trying to do
[4:12:10] <%Xelhesia> SHES SLANE FROM BERSERK BASICALLY MINUS THE NUN SHIT
[4:12:11] <+deviljhojho_> 3 for 3
[4:12:12] <%Aeogard> You can just take the left path pat...
[4:12:12] <JayPastaForce> I'd like the POV from the knight
[4:12:13] <+Jimboq> LUL
[4:12:13] <%GingaNZ> maybe the third time
[4:12:14] <+taltalheights> ¬°Baby at Risk!
[4:12:15] <blue8moon> Pat just being killed by fetuses over and over agin
[4:12:17] <Dao_Puppy> I mean those fetuses would have clogged up the vacuum easily...
[4:12:19] <%josstil> gotta avoid the baby trap
[4:12:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jesus
[4:12:25] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt can you not attack the sludge babies?
[4:12:27] <SirJotero> From what I understand, Astraea is giving the Valley residents an *affinity* for filth and disease, allowing them to live in it.
[4:12:28] <Overloard> abortion stunlock
[4:12:29] <%captain_thickthighs> Don't speed run the abortion
[4:12:29] <Deadmanslegacy> maybe just do it the normal way?
[4:12:29] <%AFlyingTaco1> @Aeogard He's probably going for the new achievement
[4:12:30] <%Aeogard> i think Allant still gives the most souls for his soul
[4:12:30] <PkSilent01> is pat trying to get dark world tendency
[4:12:31] <+Adalore> the path left leads to a knight though. :p
[4:12:33] <%Monkeyweed21> she loves the smell down here
[4:12:35] <Ashenik1> So she is innocent or what?
[4:12:40] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[4:12:42] <+twohitgood> they're like the nito babies.

[4:13:14] <+Jaysky> I thought this guy spoke to you too?
[4:13:15] <%Alazull> by using an evil power
[4:13:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the music only starts when garl aggros i think

[4:14:54] <Helmed> i thought she died in one hit too
[4:14:55] <coffeebearCafe> nice
[4:14:55] <+mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> they gave her health???

[4:14:58] <+Adalore> looks like she put some stats into vit.
[4:14:58] <DianaTheAscian> no
[4:14:59] <Flakari> Use a bow
[4:15:01] <+twohitgood> wouldn't be an achievement if it were that easy.
[4:15:01] <+deviljhojho_> fake fan
[4:15:03] <2deep5u> she has wrath of god
[4:15:03] <Aydarkzero> if you had a str build LUL

[4:15:07] <+santafer> "Pat fails to kill the Hot Pope"
[4:15:08] <%WhereIsWill> doesn't she fight if garl is alive?
[4:15:08] <Deadmanslegacy> might have to actually kill Garl
[4:15:08] <+twohitgood> ...it is as easy as using arrows, though.
[4:15:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Flakari Like a civilized man
[4:15:12] <CrimsonFox777> The babbies have made her strong.
[4:15:12] <islandoasis> fake fan
[4:15:12] <JayPastaForce> gotta fight the bonk squad
[4:15:12] <%YakumoYomi> That was always the case, wasn't it?

[4:15:22] <%WhereIsWill> guard go bonk
[4:15:23] <+KENTASHIRO> old classic was use a bow on her from a distance and slowly chip away
[4:15:24] <+twohitgood> but the achievo is for killing her without killing carl.
[4:15:24] <Aydarkzero> he is anti magic
[4:15:25] <PkSilent01> @blue8moon he's going for the trophy in which you don't kill Gar
[4:15:28] <Jack8274> Ot
[4:15:28] <+idyota> but achievement tho
[4:15:30] <Fefe41> There's a trophy for not killing Garl which is what he's trying to do probably
[4:15:31] <islandoasis> eat the babies to gain their power
[4:15:34] <%captain_thickthighs> The fact she screams in pain is that new?
[4:15:34] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> or do the bow trick
[4:15:36] <jellssssss20> Someone said there‚Äôs an achievement for killing her without killing him so he‚Äôs trying for it
[4:15:37] <DianaTheAscian> what happens if u kill her first? @PatStaresAt
[4:15:39] <%Aeogard> GOTTA GET THE CHIEVOS
[4:15:40] <TheSphereHunter> Guard Vinland
[4:15:40] <SirJotero> The only way to defeat her without killing Garl first is to shoot her with arrows from the other side.
[4:15:40] <huskarl_zap> kill garl
[4:15:42] <%walternatorz> easier to ask Paige to kill woman.
[4:15:43] <amcracken> You shall not pass

[4:17:13] <WakeUpThrow> Music isn't BAD, but I do think it pales in comparison to the original
[4:17:14] <+Adalore> I heard that was the cheese strat, just manual arrow aiming
[4:17:15] <hassanico2> @Broken_Sonex It's like generic "EPIC REMIX" off of youtube

[4:17:43] <Deadmanslegacy> @aydarkzero i think you get og music with pre order
[4:17:45] <huskarl_zap> he didnt talk to garl
[4:17:47] <+LandOfTheWay> did anyone tell pat about the new cool armor?
[4:17:49] <hassanico2> @Garthunox I'm saying the original track is amazing
[4:17:51] <+buffn99> The new music sounds great, but the tone is completely different
[4:17:55] <islandsunn> lol
[4:17:56] <+twohitgood> lol
[4:17:57] <Overloard> lies
[4:17:58] <%VvTacoSaladvV> He died of sadness
[4:18:00] <+CelticFrost70> whys pat keep killing himself
[4:18:02] <%collind99> Pat go talk to garl
[4:18:04] <RyuuAoi> BY MIDNIGHT?? @patstaresat
[4:18:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> Garl died of loneliness
[4:18:13] <%Garthunox> @hassanico2 but you're saying this one is bad
[4:18:14] <%tusk102> @CelticFrost70 world tendency
[4:18:17] <CrimsonFox777> BY MIDNIGHT!!!
[4:18:19] <hassanico2> @CelticFrost70 Tendency
[4:18:20] <%1buckboom> @PatStaresAt Can't even die right, gives me conniptions
[4:18:21] <%KineKithZen> Kappa
[4:18:23] <Aydarkzero> @Deadmanslegacy i think you're thinking of re2r
[4:18:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> That I can agree with
[4:18:24] <%machshop> it's always midnight somewhere
[4:18:27] <Meekest> Thats when Paige turns back into a pumpkin
[4:18:27] <Flakari> Or when the sun comes up!
[4:18:27] <@SoFarFetched> It ends when Pat says it ends
[4:18:28] <+lordericter> pat that is the dumbest
[4:18:28] <blue8moon> It's not midnight for me for almost 3 hours
[4:18:28] <islandoasis> cause that's when you turn into a gremlin pat
[4:18:29] <+MisterAvry> End of business day
[4:18:34] <+KENTASHIRO> it's weird that Pat is so absurdly right about the day not being over until you sleep
[4:18:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> You wanna hold that up in court Pat?
[4:18:35] <CrimsonFox777> The Day ends when the Night begins, duh. Kappa
[4:18:36] <CandyCoatedConfection> SeemsGood solid logic
[4:18:36] <Jack8274> Pat, be nice he's a pumpkin
[4:18:36] <PkSilent01> So why does Pat keep killing himself when he's a human again?
[4:18:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> No, the day is over. The next day starts
[4:18:38] <hassanico2> @Garthunox It's approximately a hundred times worse and ruins the feel of the encounter, yes
[4:18:38] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat YOU NEED TO PAY ME THEN!!
[4:18:40] <DianaTheAscian> that's not how time works but okay
[4:18:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so midnight then
[4:18:41] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt where's that new shortcut?
[4:18:42] <lastnamesilverlastname> By midnight or riot
[4:18:45] <Overloard> garl died of straight simping
[4:18:46] <%derekwst3> its only 9pm for me, so you still have time
[4:18:47] <+Adalore> these load times yo
[4:18:48] <gronzen> One of the few things I agree with Pat
[4:18:48] <Daxalog> So you have 12 hr days?
[4:18:48] <AGood_Noodle> Why do you want to kill yourself when you become human exactly?
[4:18:49] <%walternatorz> Pat will never sleep.
[4:18:53] <Fefe41> TWO. MINUTES. TO MIDDDDNIGHT
[4:18:53] <%Broken_Sonex> @hassanico2 This is far from being butchered.
[4:18:57] <devanmuse> you heard him, chat. he'll have the game beat by midnight OR HE'LL SHIT HIMSELF ON STREAM
[4:18:58] <+SickBangerzM9> are you gonna get the hms?
[4:19:02] <%Jaller101514> Bye Midnight Westcoast? Is only 8:15 here
[4:19:06] <Slim_Lipid> Day is over when the sun goes down. After that it's night :)
[4:19:07] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Overloard It's true
[4:19:12] <%Alazull> @patstaresat beating it in one working day counts
[4:19:15] <hassanico2> @Broken_Sonex The melody is nonexistent for 75% of the remix
[4:19:16] <+Mitchellsocks> Has he finished Shrine yet?
[4:19:17] <Deadmanslegacy> @aydarkzero i pre ordered this and I think it said i was getting original soundtrack
[4:19:20] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt did you try fractured mode yet?
[4:19:33] <+SickBangerzM9> whats fractured mode?
[4:19:36] <%Anime_Flux> dog brigade!
[4:19:36] <CrimsonFox777> @AGood_Noodle Dying in human form pushes a world's tendency to Black, and it's hard to keep it White.
[4:19:37] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt I love you :)
[4:19:42] <%baronouroboros> That fight was supposed to be tragic and you were supposed to feel bad about it, Pat. :(
[4:19:46] <Jack8274> @SickBangerzM9 Mirror mode
[4:19:48] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt If you do a second stream run, you should do Fractured Mode
[4:20:04] <%RoboticAnimeDude> RoboticAnimeDude subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! hey pat did you watch the trailer for the monster hunter movie last month it looks so bad it could be good
[4:20:07] <%ChestMimik> What does World Tendency actually do?
[4:20:08] <Clundy> I can‚Äôt believe pats gonna eat Elmo hair if he doesn‚Äôt beat it by midnight EST
[4:20:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do a shield/sword/bow run
[4:20:14] <+LandOfTheWay> does pat have access to sparkly? and if so, did he trade the coins?
[4:20:14] <%Anime_Flux> good trade
[4:20:15] <%Broken_Sonex> @hassanico2 Whatever man. I like it.
[4:20:18] <Aydarkzero> @Deadmanslegacy hmm
[4:20:20] <oniwahoo> Fuckin dead
[4:20:20] <%FacetiousAF> 4:20 Kappa
[4:20:29] <count1999> so why does pat kill himself everytime he gets his body back
[4:20:29] <+Adalore> @ChestMimik SOme world state item access stuff.
[4:20:38] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat FUCKN FINE, PAT. BEAT IT WHEN YOU WANNA. I JUST GLAD I AM HERE AND YOU ARE AS WELL. bleedPurple
[4:20:41] <+Mitchellsocks> Gucci sword time
[4:20:42] <%captain_thickthighs> Well I gotta furniture to move and poison to lay good night fuckos
[4:20:46] <+Adalore> Because if you die as "Human" it pushes the whole world set towards dark tendency.
[4:20:56] <$Faustgesicht> How do you go towards white world tendency?
[4:21:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt a bow run would be neat since we've pretty much only seen big heavy, a dex, and now a magic run from you/woolie
[4:21:08] <+twohitgood> i hate that the wagons don't break with rolling
[4:21:08] <%ChestMimik> Does Battle Tendency lean closer to white or black?
[4:21:16] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You don't care about Selen's sword?
[4:21:19] <%asgard147> naw, says guy
[4:21:20] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Faustgesicht Kill bosses and invaders
[4:21:21] <CrimsonFox777> @Faustgesicht Killing bosses and invaders.
[4:21:28] <+twohitgood> he hit his saving throw
[4:21:32] <islandoasis> woolie is a mag build too?
[4:21:35] <%N0bdyNoOne> @ChestMimik I would think it doesn't matter if your black or white
[4:21:40] <%DedlokPM> @ChestMimik black increases drop rate and damage you take. white increases damage you do, but decreases drop rate. Tendency state also affects whether certain story events/npcs appear
[4:21:43] <+idyota> magic pixel
[4:21:44] <count1999> oh so hes going towards black tendency? does that mean hes going for the prime evils?
[4:21:46] <islandoasis> i figured he go big boy tanklord
[4:21:47] <Aydarkzero> White can be obtained from killing bosses, invaders and not dying
[4:21:48] <+SickBangerzM9> can we see the terrible fat minister redesign pat?
[4:21:50] <Fefe41> I kind of miss the loading screens where they show the different NPCs, they looked so badass
[4:22:01] <JayPastaForce> lol, what are bridges
[4:22:02] <CrimsonFox777> OFFICIAL CLOTHES baerPOG
[4:22:06] <%Garthunox> The Pat Official

[4:22:10] <+Mitchellsocks> Blueblood Sword?
[4:22:23] <@SoFarFetched> try not to spam chat with the same messages over and over.
[4:22:29] <Slim_Lipid> @Fefe41 Double RIP loading screen minigames FeelsBadMan
[4:22:31] <segychan> are there any load times in this game
[4:22:33] <+SickBangerzM9> pat how dark is the game for you?

[4:22:49] <%Taisuru> Remember when pat said "Black Official"? Good times
[4:22:52] <Jack8274> Pat, have you tried the Vivid colour filter? It adds more world reflection
[4:22:54] <%tusk102> oh someone got bonked

[4:23:48] <urmom467> Bloodborne???
[4:23:49] <%Broken_Sonex> FROM BLACK FAT EVIL TO JUST FAT EVIL
[4:23:51] <%Xelhesia> THIS IS VERY BLOODBORNE
[4:23:52] <%Alazull> Gonna be pulling Soul Arrows outta their FAT ASSES
[4:23:55] <%Higure_yoru> Did Pat switch to bloodborne?
[4:23:55] <%Taisuru> @SickBangerzM9 Oh shush, they did a great job for the most part
[4:23:56] <%FacetiousAF> big hat pat
[4:24:00] <+Walopoh> It looks fine chat
[4:24:02] <+Mitchellsocks> Cage of Mensis really is Bloodborne's Xanthid variant
[4:24:04] <%KaiserMario> Look at it jiggle hehehe
[4:24:07] <+KENTASHIRO> This is very Persona
[4:24:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> what a fucking dumb hat
[4:24:19] <+sermittens> cart is a rockn don't come a knokn
[4:24:20] <+Lulu19> people are having sex in those carriages
[4:24:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> makes me wish we got new bloodborne
[4:24:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's full of all the exaggerated swagger of a black skeleton
[4:24:30] <DazzlingFuhrer> @Taisuru yeah you just have to ignore all the music, the UI, and a lot of the designs, that's all. :)
[4:24:32] <islandsunn> also shades of the undead settlement/borial valley
[4:24:37] <+Mitchellsocks> Yeah, I love the inspiration this game took from Persona 5. There's a castle!
[4:24:39] <hassanico2> He's so terrible in this version
[4:24:39] <+superdeliverer> literal bloodborne fireballs down the corridor
[4:24:39] <$Raikouija> who is this ass?
[4:24:42] <+ApocalypticExpress> wheres the dignity
[4:24:43] <%FacetiousAF> gimme the polearm tho

[4:24:46] <+twohitgood> i wonder if you could snipe fatty from a distance with a bow?
[4:24:46] <%Anime_Flux> kay then...
[4:24:46] <Jack8274> LUL
[4:24:49] <islandsunn> that dude took and L
[4:24:50] <%AncelDeLambert> From really has been making the same game for ten years
[4:24:50] <islandoasis> they kept that little animation in
[4:24:53] <%Broken_Sonex> LOOK AT THAT FAT EVIL
[4:24:58] <Overloard> just to remind you hes evil
[4:24:58] <Clundy> Cute
[4:25:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> more like Fat Bootleg
[4:25:12] <%T_Sasquatch> @anceldelambert and it's fun everytime
[4:25:21] <hassanico2> The original was fat with dignity
[4:25:24] <islandoasis> @AncelDeLambert they've been making the same game since kf1
[4:25:24] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt these guys seem normal
[4:25:27] <Jolnir> VapeNation
[4:25:28] <islandoasis> its eerie
[4:25:29] <%ChestMimik> I can't believe they would rip off Bloodborne like this
[4:25:30] <%Broken_Sonex> @hassanico2 Oh, hey, i agree :)
[4:25:32] <Ultimatefool> Pat why are you cheating using magic how dare you
[4:25:33] <%FacetiousAF> you lot are nothing to the big hat pat
[4:25:49] <%Punchasaur> people saying this is like bloodborne is like when people say twewy is like p5
[4:25:49] <%collind99> This is the only redesign that I think is *bad*
[4:25:51] <segychan> magic fuckin rules
[4:26:01] <%Taisuru> @collind99 Same
[4:26:04] <+SickBangerzM9> why is everything overgrown? boletaria has only been under siege for like 3 years
[4:26:07] <hassanico2> @Broken_Sonex PogChamp hell yeah
[4:26:23] <%collind99> generally it‚Äôs mostly improvements
[4:26:28] <%Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat is the fat official sentient and cognizant or are he and the rest insane for whatever reason
[4:26:31] <hassanico2> Oh man I wonder what Spy would say about all this
[4:26:32] <Fefe41> Don't worry, just listen to the chat's guidance and we may or may not lead you to the trap areas here
[4:26:34] <%Broken_Sonex> I miss his big creepy smile....his ebony skin....
[4:26:41] <SirJotero> @SickBangerzM9 Yet another example of how Bluepoint doesn't really think beyond "looks cool."
[4:26:44] <Clundy> This really makes me wanna play blood borne again
[4:26:46] <blue8moon> Some plants actually grow absurdly fast
[4:26:51] <islandsunn> it was always like that
[4:26:53] <%Garthunox> weeds grow absurdly fast
[4:26:54] <%za7az> Magic
[4:26:57] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I don't know if people realize how quickly vines and shit grow.
[4:26:58] <+twohitgood> it doesn't take long for things to become overgrown if you just don't ever take care of anything.
[4:26:58] <%Fooguwu> maybe it was already overgrown
[4:26:58] <RyuuAoi> It's fine
[4:27:02] <%ChestMimik> Ivy grows stupid fast
[4:27:09] <urmom467> TIME IN LORDRAN IS CONVOLUTED
[4:27:13] <+lordericter> I assume it has something to do with that weird giant plant demon that is besieging the city
[4:27:14] <dan_g_v> time is covoluted in lordran
[4:27:14] <+twohitgood> vines grow real fucking fast.
[4:27:19] <%T_Sasquatch> It really doesn't take that long for shit to grow
[4:27:20] <Twilightspfan> Demon weeds, they grow faster then stupid fast
[4:27:21] <%Garthunox> at my old job i had to burn weeds growing through cracks like once ever two weeks
[4:27:21] <Slim_Lipid> Shit grows like weeds
[4:27:22] <blue8moon> Vines will totally grow up most of a wall in three years if no one trims them
[4:27:24] <+Adalore> look, the overgrowth is nature healing. Kappa
[4:27:25] <DazzlingFuhrer> bed of chaos took a big fat shit in boletaria
[4:27:28] <CrimsonFox777> Some demons love gardening. You would know that if you didn't go straight to murdering them. :)
[4:27:31] <%Alazull> ivy can grow like a motherfucker if it isnt pruned constantly
[4:27:31] <islandoasis> look man, truth is bolataria has always had a poor union for gardeners and landscapers
[4:27:35] <%baronouroboros> uh, weeds. vines, and other plants grow super quick
[4:27:38] <+Adalore> Maybe we're the real demon's.
[4:27:38] <Clundy> Vines were also decorative and were used to cover up walls that were old and worn
[4:27:40] <RyuuAoi> Shit. WHY IS EVERYTHING OVERGROWN RN? HUMANS.
[4:27:44] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Shit would look this overgrown in like a month with no groundskeeping.
[4:27:47] <%Taisuru> Nature takes over way faster than you think people
[4:27:50] <huskarl_zap> ALSO
[4:27:56] <hassanico2> oh yeah this place is lousy with sneak attack thieves
[4:27:58] <%Punchasaur> it takes like a week for ivy to grow to the top of my fence
[4:28:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, one month and the grass is this long
[4:28:03] <segychan> the camera is kinda weird
[4:28:09] <%T_Sasquatch> Nature attempts to reclaim the land but humans are like heh no
[4:28:16] <blue8moon> Some tress might take 100 years to grow, but a lot of plants will grow super fast and not stop, hence why you have to prune stuff
[4:28:16] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt You gonna go for the witch?
[4:28:17] <%T_Sasquatch> Lawnmower go brrrrr
[4:28:22] <Aydarkzero> take that nature
[4:28:24] <%collind99> pat this hat is hurting you
[4:28:26] <huskarl_zap> NINJAS
[4:28:28] <%ChestMimik> Imagine going to school for soldier stuff and you die to some putz in a big hat ringing a bell at you
[4:28:28] <+shry7> Nature needs to use Manscaped
[4:28:29] <KasiCrafter> Remember when parrying was a thing?
[4:28:29] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt why are these soldiers not infect with the Demon juice
[4:28:41] <%Alazull> Ivy grows at a rate of 9 feet per year at least
[4:28:46] <%Taisuru> LUL
[4:28:48] <islandsunn> oof
[4:28:48] <+lordericter> heHA
[4:28:48] <islandoasis> rekt
[4:28:49] <%Anime_Flux> welp
[4:28:52] <%baronouroboros> The demons killed all the weed pruners
[4:28:52] <blue8moon> Nice
[4:28:52] <segychan> wow get dunked
[4:28:52] <%josstil> nice combo
[4:28:52] <Aydarkzero> the soldiers are insane
[4:28:53] <Ultimatefool> Yeah camera is like 2 inches to the right, like not really over-the-shoulder

[4:32:42] <Twilightspfan> @chestmimik why not ninja
[4:32:43] <+HaloPlayerNamedJohn> is that a member of robin hoods crew from Shrek?
[4:32:44] <Clundy> Shinobi*
[4:32:48] <%T_Sasquatch> Obviously
[4:32:49] <jellssssss20> Is that all the exact same move set it used to have?
[4:32:49] <SovPho> other reasons are sheer foolishness
[4:32:52] <%Alazull> the old couldnt see defense, huh?
[4:32:56] <%Broken_Sonex> If you die without the hat you have no excuse
[4:32:57] <%ChestMimik> @Twilightspfan Fair
[4:32:58] <RyuuAoi> Where's PEACH? She can help!
[4:33:12] <%Minicow1> Never be cool, always be lame
[4:33:13] <+RalvrWuff> This is so much better to watch than Praetorium cutscenes.
[4:33:13] <RyuuAoi> #GETSMOKED
[4:33:13] <%derekwst3> @laazybulbasaur i would assume so
[4:33:18] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the coolest thing you can be in Souls is alive
[4:33:18] <redial_nick> if you don't die you'll win 4Head
[4:33:23] <%Monkeyweed21> The fat official's ORB is filled with evil spaghetti, as opposed to Pat and his Heroic Chili
[4:33:34] <+superdeliverer> where the hat go
[4:33:38] <$laazybulbasaur> oh no the hat is gone :\
[4:33:39] <%Minicow1> Never fight fair, that's a losing strategy
[4:33:41] <Aydarkzero> do you know the rules? Kappa
[4:33:43] <+twohitgood> john madden level analysis
[4:33:43] <islandoasis> you'l win if you die
[4:33:44] <islandsunn> he could get stuck in geometry and not die
[4:33:45] <Clundy> Evil Bolognese
[4:33:48] <RyuuAoi> @redial_nick KappaPride
[4:33:50] <+SolidusRex> Pat dies when he is killed
[4:33:54] <huskarl_zap> oh no ninjas
[4:33:57] <+RalvrWuff> Chili is heroic as long as it doesn't have bay leaves
[4:33:58] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt can you do the banjo stream the same night as you makeup stream?
[4:34:01] <%Broken_Sonex> @Monkeyweed21 Which makes Pat the Good- Fat Evil
[4:34:13] <%ChestMimik> So moon grass is weed right?
[4:34:20] <%T_Sasquatch> How come this game doesn't have cooler sorcery techniques
[4:34:25] <Clundy> Pat is Orb orb is true gray

[4:34:55] <%Broken_Sonex> Pat is.....The Grey Orb.
[4:34:57] <%Anime_Flux> He must always practice the art of invisibility
[4:34:58] <%WhereIsWill> these ninjas aint playin around pat
[4:34:59] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt They're hanging on all kinds of balconies

[4:35:41] <huskarl_zap> Porcelain Throne
[4:35:42] <islandsunn> at the haberdashery
[4:35:45] <Aydarkzero> i really do appreciate the option to turn off the helmet
[4:35:46] <blue8moon> Hat I think drops from the one in the room where you unlock her
[4:35:47] <%Alazull> Then he pulled out his gun!
[4:35:50] <TheDarkRemRem99> just keep goin

[4:36:01] <DianaTheAscian> thats just a gun
[4:36:01] <SirJotero> The hat is on the official down below
[4:36:05] <%Solid_Stro> Roundhouse!!
[4:36:06] <$laazybulbasaur> @PatStaresAt you are nothing without the hat
[4:36:11] <SirJotero> The one up top with the crossbowmen is different
[4:36:12] <%WhereIsWill> tatsumaki!
[4:36:12] <islandsunn> this guy is literally the robin hood knock off from shrek
[4:36:18] <%Emperor_Machinus> all them fancy moves mean nothing to GUN
[4:36:19] <%Alazull> Aw, hr almost got SSS
[4:36:20] <devanmuse> who's this motherfucker doing backflips?
[4:36:29] <islandoasis> you get the hat by buying the gacha bundles
[4:36:30] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt is it a tiny hat?
[4:36:36] <+HaloPlayerNamedJohn> "Get em boys!" *gun bang
[4:36:42] <%baronouroboros> This is Metroid Souls now
[4:36:43] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Weak sauce! SKYWARD SWORD WAS AMAZING.
[4:36:45] <morethantwo> best shooter of 2020
[4:36:47] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @Emperor_Machinus Isshin, The Gun Saint.
[4:36:47] <%baronouroboros> I think
[4:36:56] <%Broken_Sonex> Nobody knew who Par was until he put on the hat
[4:36:58] <Slim_Lipid> anor londo?
[4:37:02] <%Broken_Sonex> Pat*
[4:37:02] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:37:03] <blue8moon> I bet it was a nice place before it all went to shit
[4:37:04] <RyuuAoi> @baronouroboros But Pat hates Metroid.
[4:37:04] <$laazybulbasaur> @derekwst3 Its massive and very smelly
[4:37:05] <+hoenhime344> its less delapidated
[4:37:12] <CrimsonFox777> Of course the officials have a bureaucracy just for getting one particular hat. "I'm sorry, but you have to go to THIS official for a cool hat."
[4:37:18] <theanora1> "My ranged it better"
[4:37:19] <+hoenhime344> than the bridge
[4:37:26] <islandoasis> everyone saw the newer leaks from capcom? some of those names mang. sounds very gachay
[4:37:42] <islandsunn> DES is way more british than the other souls games in the architecture - dark souls feels very germanic and french in comparison
[4:37:48] <Clundy> It‚Äôs 2020 every game is gacha
[4:37:49] <+AMagicalFlute> @PatStaresAt What are your thoughts on The Last of Us II getting Ultimate Game Award for 2020
[4:37:54] <%baronouroboros> @RyuuAoi did not know that, honestly
[4:38:00] <SovPho> holy shit look at his fucked up face

[4:39:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> I love how castle like this area is
[4:39:41] <zachneely1119> okay cool
[4:39:52] <%heartlesshealer> pat fought the mans

[4:40:11] <$laazybulbasaur> he looked so ready to defend his castle
[4:40:17] <zoso_xvii> you is good
[4:40:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What are you talking about, if he wasn't hard he wouldn't be called the Penetrator
[4:40:26] <%Ascethetic> youre still going huh
[4:40:30] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Imagine looking as cool as Penetrator and then losing to a guy with MC Hammer pants and a towel on his head.
[4:40:30] <jellssssss20> I did too
[4:40:31] <zoso_xvii> zing
[4:40:43] <IminyourBase> demon's souls sure is easy when you have a GUN
[4:40:44] <hassanico2> Almost there
[4:40:45] <CrimsonFox777> Reminds me of when Paige swung at the one trap in Dark Souls 1 and we found out she guessed her eye prescription.
[4:40:48] <%Alazull> thats a fair wage
[4:40:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> Gun is faster than crossbow squad
[4:40:52] <hassanico2> I think the boss approach has like 9 dudes on a bridge
[4:41:02] <jellssssss20> I‚Äôll take it!
[4:41:03] <%Anime_Flux> thunk
[4:41:04] <zoso_xvii> 200 is the going rate for fucking off
[4:41:25] <$laazybulbasaur> Bunch of idiots running around with swords check out this gun
[4:41:26] <i_am_therydon> is this why nerds always cast firebolt?
[4:41:31] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt i fucking hate that bodies get in the way of magic, but you can chop through every guy with the same swing
[4:41:35] <%N0bdyNoOne> How much to fuck on?
[4:41:36] <islandoasis> pat, you need to get the secret achievement by soulsucking the penetrator
[4:41:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Helppp>
[4:41:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Helppp?
[4:41:43] <%JumboCrunchies> JumboCrunchies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I havent watched in a few streams but why does Pat have a gun?
[4:41:46] <jellssssss20> That fireball spell is basically just a gun

[4:48:35] <+twohitgood> seigmeyer is kinda a mix of ostrava and biorr.
[4:48:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> just now?!
[4:48:36] <gronzen> ...Wow
[4:48:36] <%WackyGear> proto sieg!
[4:48:38] <%Monkeyweed21> wow this game really ripped of DS3
[4:48:40] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @PkSilent01 Northern Regalia scales really well but you need to have pure black or white character tendency.
[4:48:41] <%JeanGardner99> @morethantwo 3 days i believe
[4:48:47] <RetroCop87> Woke up and found a dapper onion suit
[4:48:48] <AncyentMarinere> Hmmmmmmmmm

[4:48:54] <morethantwo> Thanks @JeanGardner99
[4:48:55] <%Stipli> That guy is very tired it seems
[4:48:57] <+twohitgood> because ostrava always needs to be bailed out like siegmeyer
[4:48:59] <Jack8274> You are close
[4:48:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thouoght of Ostrava as like Solaire
[4:49:02] <+TopTieramisu> biorr is too chad to be onion bro
[4:49:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Narcolepsy is no joke
[4:49:11] <jellssssss20> I desperately want that super power to just be able to fall asleep instantly
[4:49:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> You might even finish by midnight LUL
[4:49:12] <+Duece9BloodGang> What would Aris and Patt sound like streaming this?
[4:49:15] <%WhereIsWill> and with a cool hat too!
[4:49:19] <blue8moon> Ostrava ain't cool enough to be Solaire
[4:49:26] <RetroCop87> THAT DACHSUND WITH NARCOLEPSY IS PRETTY CUTE, THO
[4:49:26] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt alot like the sieg from ds3 since he gets locked in a cell just before a boss fight that he helps in (yhorm/penetrator)
[4:49:27] <alwayspronking> oh this feels super bloodborne
[4:49:29] <%Xelhesia> I HOPE DS1 GETS A SIMILAR TREATMENT AS THIS DID
[4:49:29] <tidalwafer> look at your character in the equip screen
[4:49:30] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @TopTieramisu How dare you attack my sweet onion like this?
[4:49:33] <+santafer> Reachning blightown
[4:49:36] <+TopTieramisu> aris already played through the remake
[4:49:38] <islandoasis> if you dont finish by moonlight you owe me a greatsword
[4:49:42] <%Broken_Sonex> @SirKeigan Don't you start now, young man
[4:49:49] <%Ascethetic> @Xelhesia you know it wont
[4:49:50] <%Piemono> How long would Pat have to be asleep before he would consider his day done?
[4:49:51] <%heartlesshealer> yay door
[4:49:56] <%koolaid_kevster> is code vein a controller game?
[4:49:56] <+TopTieramisu> @VvTacoSaladvV i love onion bro. cowardice and all
[4:50:00] <Aydarkzero> ostrava is Solaire w/ combat experince
[4:50:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> Why is Ostrava such a coward until the Penetrator fight?
[4:50:07] <%Stipli> spot-on message LUL
[4:50:09] <SirJotero> Now prepare for the worst remake redesign, everybody...
[4:50:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's a specific message
[4:50:09] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt who did you like more, siegmeyer or solaire?
[4:50:14] <+santafer> huh, I dont remember this
[4:50:17] <SirJotero> They made Yuria bland as all hell
[4:50:28] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[4:50:28] <Jack8274> You didn't need the set LUL
[4:50:29] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @TopTieramisu Siegward is his much less cowardly cousin tho
[4:50:31] <AncyentMarinere> I don‚Äôt think DS1 would get a remake if it was already remastered on current/last gen
[4:50:31] <%Xelhesia> LOL
[4:50:32] <Jack8274> But Yuria tho
[4:50:36] <%ChestMimik> He really just stood there and let you stab him huh
[4:50:36] <%tusk102> @Aydarkzero solaire did have combat experience, he gets to places faster than you and patches mentions that he's stupidly strong to the point patches doesn't want to hurt him
[4:50:37] <Fefe41> Yuria second best waifu
[4:50:38] <$laazybulbasaur> an idiot on fire
[4:50:39] <DianaTheAscian> ???
[4:50:40] <Jack8274> Best waifu in the game
[4:50:40] <%josstil> you are the bye bye man now
[4:50:42] <gronzen> @koolaid_kevster yes
[4:50:43] <lastnamesilverlastname> LUL
[4:50:46] <%Piemono> He did not seem to give a shit
[4:50:48] <+idyota> gf time
[4:50:51] <+TopTieramisu> @VvTacoSaladvV true. but i find him much less interesting than siegmeyer

[4:53:36] <PkSilent01> How do you get the coin
[4:53:37] <+LandOfTheWay> worth it for the armor

[4:54:15] <AGood_Noodle> How good is the armor set?
[4:54:16] <islandoasis> wait, did old monk mechanic ever make it to 3?

[4:54:20] <islandoasis> idont recall it
[4:54:22] <i_am_therydon> wand go pew pew pew
[4:54:23] <+twohitgood> there were 11 total found in a playthrough last i saw. you gotta do 2 full playthroughs and a little more to get all 26 ceramic coins needed.
[4:54:23] <%WhereIsWill> getem pat

[4:58:22] <+TopTieramisu> biorr's brother is dead
[4:58:23] <+santafer> Those archers did more damage than the PENETRATOR
[4:58:24] <+twohitgood> also, they changed metas' name in the remake. he was originally called metas the lance knight. now ostrava calls him metas the penetrator.
[4:58:25] <islandoasis> pat not gonna die at nexus?
[4:58:25] <%penitentpendant> Tags: Double Teamed
[4:58:25] <RetroCop87> is that a dead dragon?

[4:58:36] <%collind99> Pat
[4:58:51] <+twohitgood> this is the knights
[4:58:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Weighted clothing is off now
[4:58:54] <+hoenhime344> yep
[4:58:54] <+TopTieramisu> yep
[4:58:55] <islandoasis> i hated these fuckers
[4:59:00] <blue8moon> somethin like that
[4:59:00] <islandoasis> oh shit are they?
[4:59:01] <Aydarkzero> yep
[4:59:04] <+Adalore> huh, neat.
[4:59:05] <hassanico2> The 3 heroes of Boletaria
[4:59:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> That was brought up during woolie's LP
[4:59:06] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[4:59:08] <+taltalheights> Correct
[4:59:10] <+lordericter> yeah its phalanx, penetrator, and tower
[4:59:11] <%heartlesshealer> neat
[4:59:12] <%WhereIsWill> oh that makes total sense
[4:59:13] <%Stipli> they are? O_O
[4:59:18] <+CapnClassix> ISn't bow the Tower Knight?
[4:59:19] <+twohitgood> yep. metas the lance knight (penetrator), alfred the tower knight, and oolan the bow (phalanx)
[4:59:20] <%Aeogard> Is that really what they are? I never really made the connection
[4:59:21] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> phalanx is an archer girl
[4:59:22] <Aydarkzero> you don't get to pick your demon form LUL
[4:59:26] <%AFlyingTaco1> Isn't the bow user just the Umbasa gril from the nexus?
[4:59:27] <%Ynkubus_> Phalanx was effecitvley a monstorus arbalest thingy
[4:59:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pretty sure German Spy mentioned it in the LP
[4:59:27] <+TopTieramisu> phalanx.... shoots projectiles
[4:59:33] <+hoenhime344> phalanx is the spear
[4:59:44] <+santafer> Wait. Phalanx was a girl then?
[4:59:47] <+hoenhime344> hence the scraping spear
[4:59:47] <Aydarkzero> it only makes sense to cover an archer
[4:59:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> From Software may have not known what a Phalanx was.
[4:59:52] <+Mitchellsocks> Weird, cause Tower Shield knight has the Scraping Spear
[4:59:53] <%YakumoYomi> Her gun is stronger
[4:59:54] <%ChestMimik> That tank sucks at his job
[4:59:57] <%VvTacoSaladvV> It's ambiguous, but I always assume Phalanx is the archer.
[5:00:00] <%bevyrage> phalanx being a bow is because they weren't able to figure out a means to throw spears at the time. later became the foundation for the lightning spear miracles!
[5:00:01] <$laazybulbasaur> why arent they human anymore
[5:00:12] <+twohitgood> fuck alfred and his scraping spear bullshit.
[5:00:12] <DianaTheAscian> is the spear not tower knight?
[5:00:14] <moosemonkey397> ngl, it actually just doesnt line up at all>
[5:00:15] <+Adalore> because they became demon
[5:00:16] <%AFlyingTaco1> So then who are the other two if the bow girl is Phalanx?
[5:00:18] <+TopTieramisu> tower shield guy is the tower knight
[5:00:18] <Aydarkzero> soul taken from demon's
[5:00:23] <+santafer> because they were demons
[5:00:24] <+TopTieramisu> cmon, it's common sense
[5:00:25] <%Noogiez> shield boi
[5:00:29] <tidalwafer> she does shoot spears at you, thats like a bow
[5:00:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is this guy the tower knight or the phalanx cuz of the spear?
[5:00:33] <%Stipli> Did they balance the magic in the remake or is it still OP?
[5:00:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> he want to poke
[5:00:35] <+santafer> Good old turtling
[5:00:38] <+twohitgood> alfred the tower knight with his scraping spear. what a bastard.
[5:00:39] <%penitentpendant> Tink tink goes the knight
[5:00:42] <Slim_Lipid> Oh no you have to engage with him monkaS
[5:00:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt isn't the shield dude phalanx?
[5:00:47] <blue8moon> Tower Knight cause shield
[5:00:47] <huskarl_zap> Did pat fight Setsuke in 5-1?
[5:00:50] <+buffn99> tower knight
[5:00:51] <islandoasis> technically, a pavise are crossbowman with big fucking shields
[5:00:54] <highfivesquash> man with shield vs insane man with gun who will win
[5:00:55] <Aydarkzero> plus one of the trio already had uses a spear so
[5:00:55] <%moogleboy1984> "Rock. Nothing beats Rock."
[5:00:59] <%AFlyingTaco1> He's easy to backstab, at least
[5:01:00] <Slim_Lipid> nevermind LUL
[5:01:01] <SpringfieldsM> I now see the references in lothrics castle
[5:01:05] <%josstil> nice
[5:01:09] <+buffn99> @tusk102 This is tower night
[5:01:11] <islandoasis> so i guess that makes phalanx make sense
[5:01:11] <%Piemono> The menacing aura of a man just slowly walking towards you
[5:01:11] <AGood_Noodle> Would the Moonlight greatsword help since it goes through shields?
[5:01:13] <%VvTacoSaladvV> It wouldn't really make sense for the archer to be the Tower Knight. Yes, there are archers in that fight but....
[5:01:17] <%Emperor_Machinus> let the sweet poison lull him to eternal slumber
[5:01:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Block this, fucko"
[5:01:20] <Aydarkzero> @SpringfieldsM with the three pillars and what not?
[5:01:25] <%heartlesshealer> more tower shield
[5:01:25] <Aydarkzero> or 4 i forget
[5:01:25] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Can you explain the scraping spear for blind newbies?
[5:01:29] <%cylish> the 100k souls is giving me anxiety
[5:01:33] <%AFlyingTaco1> So how is the girl Phalanx?
[5:01:38] <%Solid_Stro> Time to Duel Wield Tower Shields doodNuts

[5:02:24] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @AFlyingTaco1 Phalanx is defenseless without the minions like an archer needing to be guarded by close range fighters.
[5:02:25] <Aydarkzero> give that Red Knight a promotion
[5:02:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck I didn't even see how many souls he dropped

[5:02:33] <hassanico2> That's why he doesn't suicide anymor
[5:02:38] <uncledoodsauce> do you think fromsoft will be relevant anymore now that bluepoint made a better souls game than mitazaki ever had?
[5:02:41] <islandoasis> scraping spear at old monks is a horror story i thankfully never got to expereince
[5:02:51] <SpringfieldsM> @aydarkzero the climb and the three dudes with magic, dex and str
[5:02:54] <Jack8274> You are at the end game anyway
[5:02:59] <%AFlyingTaco1> Ah, I didn't realize that they don't respawn.
[5:03:04] <+TopTieramisu> @uncledoodsauce is this a serious question?
[5:03:04] <+santafer> Anyone knows if the Pure Bladestone is still hell to get?
[5:03:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> @uncledoodsauce What game?
[5:03:09] <hassanico2> @uncledoodsauce ...the gameplay is literally unchanged dude
[5:03:15] <+Mitchellsocks> @uncledoodsauce This is literally just a reskin of a 2009 game
[5:03:24] <Fefe41> @santafer they've increased the drop rate
[5:03:25] <+hoenhime344> @uncledoodsauce bluepoint didnt make a better game...they remade the same game with better tech....
[5:03:35] <+santafer> thank god
[5:03:36] <+twohitgood> the shortcut is in this room.
[5:03:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> oh this game
[5:03:40] <nmaten> the spell effects are so impressive in this game
[5:03:42] <+twohitgood> well...the start of the shortcut.
[5:03:44] <$Hommando> I've spent a lot of time farming grass here
[5:03:44] <hassanico2> LUL
[5:03:52] <Varadox> @islandoasis The game is a reskin of OG Demons. The difference being art assets and general system improvements because of better hardware.
[5:03:53] <%Piemono> It feels like Pat is playing a third person shooter
[5:04:03] <%DedlokPM> UncleDood is on the Sauce again. doodZero
[5:04:07] <Aydarkzero> @SpringfieldsM yeah it's really cool
[5:04:13] <JayPastaForce> big gains
[5:04:15] <uncledoodsauce> but has fromsoft that looked as good as this remake? nope they haven't
[5:04:21] <+twohitgood> gonna kill the blue dragon? @PatStaresAt
[5:04:21] <%Noogiez> much grass
[5:04:24] <+chiazam> So is Pat beating the game today?
[5:04:29] <%heartlesshealer> mmmm delicious camera
[5:04:30] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The red eye gave me so many issues in the original. I think he's the real final boss
[5:04:33] <hassanico2> This bastard...
[5:04:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Dorgon
[5:04:34] <%Stipli> thankfully he decided to nicely go down the stairs instead of jump down XD
[5:04:39] <+ziggythehutt> What in Oblivion is that!?!?
[5:04:39] <%Minicow1> @uncledoodsauce next bit
[5:04:39] <%N0bdyNoOne> You gonna murder him?
[5:04:42] <studleydoorite> good old bluey
[5:04:43] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt So that ladder inside is the new shortcut
[5:04:43] <%moogleboy1984> she mad
[5:04:44] <Aydarkzero> hope you got water veil
[5:04:46] <%WhereIsWill> that property damage tho
[5:04:46] <%penitentpendant> Dragon Vergil is more ungainly than his human form
[5:04:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> My cat's name is Blue
[5:04:51] <+hoenhime344> i will say, i dont really like the bird beaks in the dragons
[5:04:52] <%Ynkubus_> Pet him Pat
[5:04:52] <%AFlyingTaco1> @uncledoodsauce Sekiro and Bloodborne both looked good, but sure. Whatever you say.

[5:04:55] <%Emperor_Machinus> gasp! a giant chicken!
[5:04:57] <+TopTieramisu> i bet uncledoodsauce is one of those guys that thinks D&D can make their own A Song of Ice and Fire
[5:04:58] <+takutoots> YO!
[5:04:58] <blue8moon> Pat plans on beating the game tonight
[5:04:58] <PkSilent01> So is this A legit Dragon or a Wyvern like in DKS
[5:05:05] <%DedlokPM> @uncledoodsauce 1) we haven't seen anything from them for this gen 2) Dark Souls 3 looked really really good
[5:05:06] <islandoasis> @Varadox i feel like demons souls never really needed this remake
[5:05:07] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> killing this guy is a nightmare iirc
[5:05:08] <+chiazam> Oh no
[5:05:08] <blewlamb> 100k
[5:05:10] <%AFlyingTaco1> It's a dragon
[5:05:10] <%Xelhesia> WELL THEN
[5:05:12] <islandoasis> but its nice to have i guess
[5:05:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sick, the gas comes out first and ignites, JUST LIKE IN RING OF FIRE

[5:05:37] <highfivesquash> ham and cheese gondolla
[5:05:37] <Varadox> @islandoasis It really didn't, but it did need to be a console/platform that allowed it to run at more than 20FPS in sections.

[5:05:57] <+kamikazekripple> would poison cloud work?
[5:05:57] <%ChestMimik> So what's the intended way to do this fight?

[5:06:05] <CandyCoatedConfection> can they be poisonedü§î
[5:06:09] <+Tragosavich> This is the way
[5:06:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is the way or run past it
[5:06:13] <+TopTieramisu> this isn't actually a fight
[5:06:14] <%Aeogard> You're SUPPOSED to run through
[5:06:14] <%Anime_Flux> We got ourselves a real slobberknocker tonight, folks...
[5:06:18] <PkSilent01> YEYEYEYE LAME IT OUT
[5:06:19] <+TopTieramisu> or at least not intended
[5:06:20] <blue8moon> oh yeah, you could switch out cling for the mp regen, since you're not getting hit, might help
[5:06:22] <%collind99> WELCOME TO THE REAL DEMON‚ÄôS SOULS
[5:06:23] <+hoenhime344> intended is a loose term
[5:06:24] <%ChestMimik> Yeah fuck that do this instead
[5:06:28] <%cvp5127> just killed the red dragon with arrows
[5:06:30] <%Punchasaur> this dragon is not very intelligent
[5:06:34] <+buffn99> You can run by pretty easily
[5:06:35] <+CrunchyFrog_> laughs in hyper mode
[5:06:36] <%Chatterbox1991> strength and muscle and Jungle Work!
[5:06:37] <%penitentpendant> Is the mana regen ring worthwhile here?
[5:06:40] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt there's actually a secret in this area not in the original game, i think
[5:06:40] <Sketchit99> When in doubt, lame it out.
[5:06:41] <highfivesquash> real pressure here on pat to defeat this dragon

[5:06:59] <%ChestMimik> No threat huh?
[5:06:59] <islandoasis> @Varadox I suppose it was a matter of what sony had at hand. they still held both des ip rights and spiderman game rights, so they became the launch titles to push the new console.

[5:07:46] <%VvTacoSaladvV> shortcut
[5:07:48] <+hoenhime344> he WILL die

[5:08:09] <PkSilent01> is this short cut new?
[5:08:11] <%Stipli> Bior is the best!
[5:08:12] <PkSilent01> Oh wow
[5:08:25] <+TopTieramisu> here's something bluepoint actually added gameplay-wise :)
[5:08:28] <%VvTacoSaladvV> This shortcut is almost pointless.
[5:08:38] <%WhereIsWill> look at this BALLER
[5:08:46] <%heartlesshealer> biorr what the fuck
[5:08:48] <%Anime_Flux> those particle effects are rad
[5:08:49] <islandoasis> @Varadox it then becomes a question of was it better to remake des or make a des2? to which I feel, remake is better cause it allows the playerbase to see a graphic/mechanical/overall improvement from previous console tech to current, in other words, as a remake it was better to showcase the console tech
[5:08:52] <blue8moon> Helpful bodies telling you where the fire ends
[5:08:53] <+shry7> the fire effects look insanely good
[5:08:58] <%AzureGale> I understand you're in need of support

[5:09:32] <%penitentpendant> Damage race, who will win?
[5:09:34] <+KENTASHIRO> this is the most demons souls
[5:09:34] <+TopTieramisu> the authentic demon's souls experience
[5:09:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did I just hear Siegmeyer's voice actor say "Do you need some help?"
[5:09:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cheese this shit out.
[5:09:36] <%AFlyingTaco1> @islandoasis It can also help ease a new generation of players into the series, instead of dropping DES2
[5:09:38] <+hoenhime344> its like 3 min... its not that bad
[5:09:40] <MildMannered_Creighton> pow, right in the kisser
[5:09:41] <PkSilent01> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[5:09:41] <%N0bdyNoOne> @WhereIsWill Ah yes, the classic dragon weakness. The chin.

[5:09:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Tickle right under his wittle chin
[5:09:45] <alwayspronking> pew!
[5:09:45] <%1buckboom> @PatStaresAt I guess we really were the Demon's Souls
[5:09:47] <%AzureGale> The game is going to cheat, so cheat right back
[5:09:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> da real demon souls starts here
[5:09:48] <+redambulant> The true demon's souls starts here
[5:09:48] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Turns out some of the original difficulty actually was due somewhat to bad framerate and graphics.
[5:09:50] <%Piemono> So if you don't have any ranged attack, does Bior just die?
[5:09:55] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt tbf this is how i kill teh drake in DS3
[5:09:55] <Varadox> @islandoasis That's largely the reason why, I would assume, they decided to have Bluepoint remake the game in the first place. To showcase their new console and to have a game people WILL want to re-buy.
[5:09:56] <blue8moon> Also Bior is super tanky
[5:09:56] <urmom467> THE REAL DEMON SOULS BEGINS HERE

[5:10:59] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @buffn99 That too. But a similar thing happened with Dark Souls Remastered. Some of the effects make it easier to figure out what the area of effect is actually supposed to be.
[5:11:01] <%ChestMimik> Bjior you smell like bacon maybe you should chill
[5:11:03] <%AzureGale> Sure quite a drain to take like 289472394 dragon flames to the face

[5:12:14] <%collind99> WAIT DOES HE JUST DIE
[5:12:14] <gronzen> ...Wait so he just dies after giving exposition?
[5:12:14] <+TopTieramisu> his shield is mostly decoration
[5:12:14] <+santafer> Of a broken heart
[5:12:16] <+hoenhime344> "magic is not that busted guys"...
[5:12:18] <+taltalheights> This key was the only thing keeping me alive
[5:12:19] <+deviljhojho_> bodied
[5:12:21] <Fefe41> Just like when he was alive, running into death
[5:12:22] <%hdhyperdrive> gg ez
[5:12:22] <+Mitchellsocks> No chance kiddo
[5:12:23] <%tusk102> he died bc he was severely injured and he happened to die dramatically just then
[5:12:24] <%heartlesshealer> Black phantom Ostrava???
[5:12:28] <%luftraumm1> really a tough game
[5:12:29] <%AFlyingTaco1> Magic really turns this into a joke, huh LUL
[5:12:31] <%AzureGale> Wow they sure went out like a chump
[5:12:32] <coffeebearCafe> i thought he was good boi
[5:12:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> his soul gets turned into a black phantom on death I guess
[5:12:40] <islandoasis> his shield is literally "its magic, aint got to explain shit"
[5:12:42] <%collind99> Does he not go back to the nexus
[5:12:42] <+TopTieramisu> magic is very broken in demon's souls
[5:12:44] <+deviljhojho_> yeah magic just breaks the game in half
[5:12:51] <%ChestMimik> Magic really is just "what if you had a gun" and I'm loving it
[5:12:53] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I got invaded right when this happened my first playthrough and thought Ostrava was a player.
[5:12:56] <%baronouroboros> Now I see why later souls games diminished the power of magic
[5:13:02] <DSD24> Pat's just vibing right now
[5:13:09] <%Broken_Sonex> Time to become the guy from the cover :)
[5:13:26] <%luftraumm1> later souls games castrated magic very hard
[5:13:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Endurance maybe?
[5:13:26] <+TopTieramisu> much like irl, royalty has a distinct advantage over other classes
[5:13:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or more MP?
[5:13:29] <%N0bdyNoOne> @Broken_Sonex No, it is time to become.... GIANT
[5:13:31] <islandoasis> its actually stronger in this remake than in the og, cause you are alot more mobile
[5:13:44] <%tusk102> BIG SOUL TIME
[5:13:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why not just eat them if you're not gonna make anything with them
[5:13:55] <+buffn99> Magic is still really strong in other souls games
[5:13:55] <Jack8274> You don't need them in your inventory pat like upgrades
[5:13:57] <MildMannered_Creighton> get huge
[5:14:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> that took forever
[5:14:02] <+santafer> Too bad you already used the Yellow Demon soul. Could've gotten the Homing Attack Drone Arrows

[5:19:42] <%DedlokPM> @collind99 meaning the stat can be still leveled, but will provide little to no benefit
[5:19:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> How much does the catalyst increase magic damage though? Is it worth it to half your MP? @PatStaresAt
[5:19:42] <DrBeanie> yeah but this is big hat pat. totally different LUL

[5:38:55] <+Adalore> so what ending are you taking? :p
[5:38:56] <%tusk102> @Xiangchang the blood and fire effects Kreygasm
[5:38:56] <DianaTheAscian> god firestorm looks lame
[5:38:57] <%ClericOfSparda> That was a rad design
[5:38:58] <%Puhff> False King you say
[5:38:58] <%heartlesshealer> body restored, check rings
[5:38:59] <Artista_AF> ohh i love the Body Restored effect
[5:39:01] <+deviljhojho_> nice throne asshole
[5:39:03] <%Broken_Sonex> @SimplyPandaz It'll be a 8/10 and everyone is gonna hate it because it's not 10/10.
[5:39:03] <Fefe41> You. Did it.
[5:39:04] <%aWanderingKaivo> I literally JUST opened the stream at the moment Allant died
[5:39:05] <%IDTheftVictim> It's a real boss, this is what magic makes everything
[5:39:06] <%RedPanda25> the smoke coming from his back looks way better. Look more like puppet strings than wings.
[5:39:06] <+deviljhojho_> man that looks so good
[5:39:07] <%penitentpendant> Weird that he blew out the wall behind his throne
[5:39:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Aw, I really wish you could go sit on his stoop.
[5:39:10] <$laazybulbasaur> so who the hell was that jobber
[5:39:13] <DSD24> Huh
[5:39:15] <+deviljhojho_> "dunno lol"
[5:39:16] <islandoasis> wut
[5:39:16] <%Alazull> can you see the gates from here?
[5:39:16] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Allant is easier now that the framerate isn't all shitty
[5:39:17] <%AFlyingTaco1> Calm down there, Old King Connery
[5:39:19] <theanora1> Now for the really hard final boss
[5:39:20] <Fefe41> They changed his voice
[5:39:21] <huskarl_zap> fiha in de wahtah WHY
[5:39:24] <hassanico2> False King Allant
[5:39:25] <+TheotherKristian> Where does this ps5 game rank among your favourite souls game?!?!
[5:39:27] <DSD24> That doesn't sound like the PS3 voice
[5:39:29] <%Stipli> um sir there is a number in the upper right corner >_>
[5:39:29] <%ChestMimik> "Maybe humans are the real monster" - an actual demon
[5:39:29] <%N0bdyNoOne> This voice is giving me leonard nimoy from fringe vibes
[5:39:30] <%rdark_ksu> a couple
[5:39:33] <+tussletoes> I am SO glad they got rid of the goofy voice filter on him now. Distorted memes ruined that.
[5:39:36] <%Aeogard> okay now which ending patrick
[5:39:41] <+Surf_Zombie> sean conner?
[5:39:45] <$RealThiele> thanks grandpa
[5:39:45] <+taltalheights> Wait, was this the tower the blue dragon destroyed on the way in?
[5:39:45] <+deviljhojho_> turns out demon souls was actually the easiest souls game with a good framerate. It just has stupid mechanics
[5:39:48] <islandoasis> how did you defeat my demon's soul(tm)?
[5:39:49] <%Ynkubus_> Its just some dude from Portobello sayin gthat
[5:39:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @huskarl_zap I understood that reference
[5:39:54] <%Punchasaur> more than 2 souls
[5:39:55] <+superdeliverer> Isn't that Frampt's voice actor?
[5:39:57] <DXLelouch24> the backstab ending OBVIOUSLY, its PAT
[5:40:00] <mattdel92> How did they het Sean Connery into the game?
[5:40:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt which ending tho
[5:40:02] <+santafer> But if there is no more lore... how will Vaati pay his bills?
[5:40:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt Don't forget about the weight of that one sword
[5:40:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> W H O A
[5:40:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> That was dramatic
[5:40:08] <RubberFistFight> @N0bdyNoOne ah, good ol' William Bell.
[5:40:08] <ArthurDoyleRPG> How many slices of bread have you eaten in your lifetime? doodScrub

[5:40:26] <DSD24> Put on the Old Monk hat
[5:40:26] <$RealThiele> opening a door via implosion
[5:40:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @deviljhojho_ I'm actually getting that opinion. I'm starting to feel like the technical limitations played a huge part in why Demon Souls was so difficult.
[5:40:27] <%juxtest> I hope you got the Demon Soul of fixing the floor in there
[5:40:29] <islandoasis> shut up and show your feet

[5:42:12] <+tussletoes> Is this what it's like to call Elmo over
[5:42:14] <%VvTacoSaladvV> "Who's a good elder god. Oh, you are!"
[5:42:15] <%YakumoYomi> @N0bdyNoOne Hopefully we'll get a resurgence, now that the game is relevant again
[5:42:16] <Dao_Puppy> I wished for a big mac though...
[5:42:18] <RubberFistFight> so just like
[5:42:18] <hassanico2> And the source of Magic AND Faith was the Old One
[5:42:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> what i stuck into it?
[5:42:19] <%N0bdyNoOne> I seriously love how it has all these giant ass swords in it
[5:42:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Shadow of the Colossus vibes ironically
[5:42:19] <RubberFistFight> set fire to it
[5:42:20] <%heartlesshealer> A New Demon
[5:42:22] <+Spoon_fresh> Those birds dont look great
[5:42:24] <%strakillias> Is this treeman related to the DS giants?
[5:42:25] <RubberFistFight> it's dry, it'll go up like tinder
[5:42:25] <%Aeoneth> So is THIS where warframes come from?

[5:42:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> run away
[5:42:52] <hassanico2> It's just a desert
[5:42:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't know where From Software got the idea of making demons trees, but I love it.
[5:42:54] <%Punchasaur> BEHOLD BIRD JPGS ONLY THE PS5 CAN RENDER

[5:43:53] <%strakillias> The first flame is just that tree on fire
[5:43:53] <cuckholdberry_finn> It looked like that originally Im pretty sure
[5:43:54] <SoySocks> so the Old One is big pottery
[5:43:55] <Calek> the end of the ringed city more like it
[5:43:57] <marvel877> Its not a lake, its an ocean.
[5:43:57] <hassanico2> They definitely changed the look compared to PS3
[5:44:01] <Maids4lyfe> maybe the Old One bursts into fire as KINDLING FOR THE FLAME

[5:44:40] <%Broken_Sonex> You can see the pigme king cralling out of frame
[5:44:42] <+santafer> just enter the eldritch glory hole. no problem
[5:44:43] <%moogleboy1984> and now, the only choice that matters
[5:44:46] <%roscoe_rosaline> Just light the wood monster on fire

[5:45:02] <%Anime_Flux> Chosen One
[5:45:03] <+buffn99> @Pigg1yJuffs The giants in the 6th archstone!
[5:45:05] <$RealThiele> maybe its backwards
[5:45:06] <%AzureGale> Optimus Prime?
[5:45:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a Lavos situation, the real Old One is the Alien inside
[5:45:08] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The fact that it's a giant tree thing still makes it somehow weirder than anything in Bloodborne.
[5:45:08] <+zzNamttamzz> it's like the tree grew out of the ash
[5:45:08] <+tussletoes> Oh they really did keep the voice filter haha

[5:45:31] <+Mitchellsocks> The real old one is the floaty white soul, the rest is coalesced around it
[5:45:32] <+santafer> second only to mist noble

[5:45:38] <+deviljhojho_> hhow will pat defeat this enemy?
[5:45:39] <samuelfisk> Allant doesn‚Äôt sound gross enough
[5:45:41] <Aydarkzero> never fight poison w/ poison
[5:45:41] <%N0bdyNoOne> Now the real question is

[5:50:04] <Calek> @PatStaresAt that's your dumb headcanon for NG+ don't be stupid
[5:50:04] <BrachyZoid> Aren't you stuck just for game reasons?
[5:50:04] <SolumFuturae> Is killing her considered the true ending?
[5:50:11] <gamerform> is that a meta-game type thing where you can't "leave" as a player, but your actual character is able to leave?
[5:50:12] <+tussletoes> We'll find that cat someday.
[5:50:21] <mattdel92> Lying bitch
[5:50:22] <%Monkeyweed21> now fuse them swords
[5:50:23] <+AugustHaze> Is there a way to save scum?
[5:50:25] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> i dont think thats cannon, thats just game +
[5:50:25] <+Adalore> it is probably the best "ending" for your individual character maybe?
[5:50:27] <%tusk102> @Calek no be rude
[5:50:28] <%barrakuta371> Well time to kill everyone in the Nexus I guess
[5:50:29] <%T_Sasquatch> Speaking of endings i looked up how to get ds3 endings .. Fuck that shit
[5:50:29] <supergoblinpunch> Monumental just laughs if you hit him
[5:50:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Great, now you'll end up becoming a giant sludge monster like King Allant, ust like you always wanted Pat.
[5:50:29] <%N0bdyNoOne> Well this game was good, but it didn't have a great chest ahead so I don't know how to feel
[5:50:32] <WakeUpThrow> I don't think there even is a "true" ending in DeS
[5:50:35] <%T_Sasquatch> Its so dumb
[5:50:35] <%ssjklyco> When's Bluepoint Devil May Cry?

[5:50:38] <+chiazam> Pat what the fuck is a dual/duel soapstone?
[5:50:38] <+tussletoes> And that's the corner Bluepoint unjustly dumped the original Fluted helmet in. Just sacrilege
[5:50:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> Was Cat the true Old One all along?
