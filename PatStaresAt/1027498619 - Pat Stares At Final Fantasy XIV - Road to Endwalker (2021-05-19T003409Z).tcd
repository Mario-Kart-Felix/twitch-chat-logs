[0:22:15] <$Hommando> It takes very minimal effort to be better than average at this game
[0:22:17] <%RetroCop87> so you're saying getting good at FFXIV is like practicing combos
[0:22:18] <DianaTheAscian> 50% of getting good is knowing the mechanics
[0:22:22] <+ChaosedStar> muscle the memories
[0:22:25] <%NitronStreams> the cooler Patron
[0:22:26] <%Monkeyweed21> you forgot to keep your DoT up @PatStaresAt
[0:22:27] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt i'm so fucking pissed the awesome goggles are gender-locked and become a plain headband on ladies
[0:22:27] <CriticKitten> My god, that rebuttal LUL
[0:22:30] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm bad at even pressing buttons, I fumble and panic a lot
[0:22:32] <%LaughingCatt> building muscle memory is by far the most important thing to actually gettting gud at a job
[0:22:35] <%SaiyanShoto> send her feet pics
[0:22:36] <+Frranky> Any alliance raid will lay bare how Bad most of the people who play this game are
[0:22:39] <PhilanthropyG> got me the Resistance Member set for the MCH. Fave set of the entire raid.
[0:22:48] <%LailahQueenx> can you fall off the walkway?
[0:22:52] <%Mekhet09> I hope it's funny and not sad.
[0:23:00] <%LailahQueenx> nope
[0:23:00] <%solracc25> Pat would you recommend maining a healer?
[0:23:05] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:23:06] <%kainhighwind1990> @LailahQueenx no
[0:23:14] <SaphronBlackbourne> My DPS is guranteed to be trash the first time through something cuz I freeze up when mechanics happen and focus on not dying
[0:23:16] <%Artemis_Scowl> LUL
[0:23:17] <+Kalentan> I've been playing PLD since 2013, I never bothered to learn the "meta" rotation. Though I don't do Savage content so.... *shrug* but maybe I should.
[0:23:18] <@PeachSaliva> lol
[0:23:18] <%Frost_Quill> @Frranky I was in a crystal tower raid where like five or six people just weren't attacking.  They were following and avoiding aoes, but otherwise were just standing there.
[0:23:23] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:23:27] <%bugz_munny> @solracc25 if you want to hate people sure
[0:23:29] <%ssjklyco> She's like a tech support customer.
[0:23:30] <%kainhighwind1990> I always thought it was funny how the most nothing fight in this raid has the most dramatic Nier music
[0:23:31] <+makouzer> does pat read donations after stream or mid-game?

[0:24:03] <SaphronBlackbourne> I've attempted Emerald EX< Titan Unreal, and E9S but didn't clear any of those
[0:24:03] <%Deft_Thought> Hansel and Gretel are so damn cool
[0:24:04] <+Kiaayo> not even related
[0:24:05] <shieldecho> If you love woman why don't you marry woman

[0:24:54] <%NateyBeak> people kill out of love
[0:24:54] <Tracazoid> What if Pat's mom was infected with the T-virus tho
[0:24:56] <%Frost_Quill> @makouzer Before and after stream, sometimes if there's a long break in the middle but not usually.
[0:24:57] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Pat these Zodiac weapon books are making me go crazy how do I keep them from making me more crazy?
[0:24:57] <@PeachSaliva> ok but what if she's a zombie and i have to do it to save our lives???
[0:24:59] <hairtoday> that's a very specific worry
[0:25:03] <Ashrox117> Pats life has a strange sudden overlap with Sons of Anarchy
[0:25:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:25:18] <Srthunda> accept your fate
[0:25:18] <+megaman_sentinel> that's a good point Paige
[0:25:22] <s__o__u__l_> LUL
[0:25:22] <%walternatorz> you have to turn off your brain
[0:25:25] <$Ziegsy> as an asexual, my mother has informed me Ill never have a close romantic relationship like these two nerds have. :D
[0:25:28] <+Grayhammatter> don't do them 4Head
[0:25:28] <+BIumen> yeah pat what if it's a shawn of the dead situation
[0:25:30] <+makouzer> @Frost_Quill thx alot
[0:25:39] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:25:39] <TioXyco> do it pussy
[0:25:40] <%MisterRockett> It's SO LONG
[0:25:42] <ethey16> @patstaresat are all your jobs at 80?
[0:25:48] <%Valdorick> Just do though
[0:25:55] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt You think they might ever get rid of positionals for physical dps?
[0:25:57] <%Mekhet09> Wtf. place of the dead?
[0:25:59] <%ShawnTK_> are they confirmed to be nerfing the palace of the dead stuff
[0:26:00] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm lucky to not like the glowy weapons, so I don't have to grind as much for my glams
[0:26:04] <%MisterRockett> What does the PotD part of the step intel?
[0:26:14] <SomersaultJustice> they should add more positionals
[0:26:21] <DianaTheAscian> I just do the weekly quest
[0:26:22] <+Frranky> Positionals are part of the reason DPS takes focus
[0:26:26] <+Frranky> that's the difficulty
[0:26:29] <%Monkeyweed21> they should have more positionals
[0:26:32] <$Ziegsy> @MisterRockett a chance every ten floors to get one of the 15 items you need
[0:26:33] <s__o__u__l_> Positionals are the only depth DPS classes have LUL
[0:26:34] <@SpaceCapnCrone> oh wow, just because Nox is a duskwight he's good at potd
[0:26:42] <%Agami23> its the one thing DPS has to handle. people who complain about them are nuts
[0:26:44] <Psyramics> so ranged phys
[0:26:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Every class should have MNK level of positionals
[0:26:49] <%Valdorick> Disk Room
[0:26:49] <blue8moon> I wouldn't call positionals depth >.>
[0:26:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> I was so DISGUSTED by Pat's duskwight racism that I died
[0:26:53] <twoto858> What complexity do melee DPS without any positionals have?
[0:26:56] <$Ziegsy> @SpaceCapnCrone he belongs in a cave.
[0:27:03] <%bugz_munny> They'll probably prune some positionals
[0:27:05] <bigdrifter> I havent done PoTD once
[0:27:07] <%BoxNavy> kinky :)
[0:27:10] <cosmicdischarge> is Black Mage the highest DPS ?
[0:27:14] <%bugz_munny> not full on remove
[0:27:16] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt it will probably have a burst phase like MCH
[0:27:17] <%king_wragles> @CreepyPorpoise We all saw it, he shoved you off the platform!
[0:27:22] <%RetroCop87> what if they have a new raid series, but it's just the same raid, only now you can understand the bosses
[0:27:28] <TioXyco> SAM has two positional,
[0:27:34] <ethey16> how are the healing classes in this game?
[0:27:34] <Brandon__Brando> why dose the map look undun?
[0:27:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you're also really bad at remembering to apply your DoT
[0:27:46] <aqua_mashu> its true
[0:27:47] <blue8moon> I hate this raid on drg because of rando tanks
[0:27:47] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt I kinda wish lvl 90 will bring back some of the resource management for tanks
[0:27:53] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Pat, all three melee lose about the same dps (10%) by not doing positionals
[0:27:56] <SpookyBeef7> NIN also has, what, two positional moves?
[0:27:57] <+Grayhammatter> which is a dps loss
[0:27:58] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm pretty new, starting playing during 5.3. I really like RDM and MCH. BLM is fun and what I leveled through the story with but I am baaaaaadddd at it
[0:27:59] <%KishinGrek> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[0:28:00] <%Agami23> pat, as a dragoon i refuse this assumption that i will do my positionals
[0:28:00] <RocketBarrel> Pat this isnwhy you are grey
[0:28:03] <afronooch> i wish whm had more dps
[0:28:05] <PhilanthropyG> Brandon its the aesthetic of Nier Automata. They are inside a server
[0:28:07] <%Valdorick> But if you don't do big damage then you're not doing number good
[0:28:08] <+burntbagels13> Dpk?
[0:28:12] <%chance_h> You can tell Pat is a tank main because he keeps aggroing chat lul
[0:28:16] <Srthunda> I think if dps lose positionals they should get tp back
[0:28:18] <%walternatorz> lol
[0:28:28] <+Frranky> my tower run last week took an hour and at the end someone didn't roll on the loot so we all had to stand there and wait for it to time out
[0:28:28] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:28:30] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not how you use it
[0:28:31] <%bugz_munny> its for when bosses jump but even then eh
[0:28:33] <%walternatorz> it's for transitions
[0:28:34] <+Princ3Mush> @PatStaresAt is shinten that important? i main samurai and hardly use it, so i might be doing something wrong lol
[0:28:35] <+projectmanatees> Don‚Äôt bring tp back haha
[0:28:35] <aqua_mashu> LUL
[0:28:36] <%Dakuu75> what does it do in this game? I forgot
[0:28:36] <%Agami23> @Srthunda TP??
[0:28:42] <GreyHeartedHero> You're supposed to use it during downtime
[0:28:43] <%BoxNavy> lol
[0:28:45] <+Smokebanshee> that's a huge damage loss though
[0:28:46] <RaidenRising> oh, is this song of the ancients?
[0:28:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> imagine not thinking meditation is useful
[0:28:48] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> meditation is good for trials like susano
[0:28:52] <Psyramics> every button that does damage is useful, lmao
[0:28:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> whats next? shirk is useless?
[0:29:01] <SaphronBlackbourne> My friend says he bops True North whenever possible and I don't know melee DPS but it sounds not ideal to me
[0:29:08] <DianaTheAscian> I don't even have meditation on my hotbar for that reason
[0:29:19] <%bugz_munny> like here is a med spot
[0:29:24] <nicegrandmafingers> true north is situational
[0:29:25] <%chance_h> *kinky master Lv 2
[0:29:26] <%kainhighwind1990> RESCUE'D
[0:29:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat is really Kinki then
[0:29:28] <%Deft_Thought> Hero pull
[0:29:31] <+gwanzan> fucking clutch rescue
[0:29:31] <%Valdorick> RESCUED, BALLS EXPOSED
[0:29:31] <nicegrandmafingers> when you cant do the positional
[0:29:34] <ItsPastas> There's always a guy that gets mad because you don't stack both twins together as tank in this raid, despite one of them having shields on taking almost no damage
[0:29:38] <blue8moon> maybe you're just shit at using meditation pat LUL
[0:29:45] <PhilanthropyG> woo woo Gamma!
[0:29:45] <Srthunda> @Agami23 old stat like mana, removed in shadowbringers
[0:29:51] <%spitelite> they should have let you die
[0:29:59] <%Dakuu75> jesus
[0:30:00] <KahnWick> Goken is the best example of Situational.
[0:30:00] <SaphronBlackbourne> TP sounded awful
[0:30:02] <+Princ3Mush> @PatStaresAt i think a majority of the time i just use kaiten to power up more moves instead of shinten
[0:30:03] <%Mekhet09> Probably summoner atm.
[0:30:05] <Nordguy> PAT
[0:30:05] <%MisterRockett> Oh my god you've leveled Blue Mage
[0:30:06] <+Kiaayo> blu
[0:30:08] <$Ziegsy> SCH, hands down
[0:30:11] <solazz> remember when ninja trick attack required back positional to get the debuff so if the tank suddenly moved the boss you lost trick
[0:30:11] <%Mekhet09> What a fucking annoying class to master.
[0:30:12] <+Grayhammatter> TP was awful
[0:30:14] <DianaTheAscian> Monk cause its so boring @PatStaresAt
[0:30:14] <%bugz_munny> SMN
[0:30:18] <%Valdorick> Bluemage is the most awful to play psaSmug
[0:30:18] <$Hommando> TP was the worst
[0:30:19] <+shinigami40297> summoner optimally
[0:30:21] <+makouzer> SCH for sure
[0:30:21] <%Monkeyweed21> you are a pretty bad SAM
[0:30:26] <%LailahQueenx> smn
[0:30:26] <Nordguy> DID YOU BRRAK YOUR VOWNOF CELIBACY?
[0:30:28] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> ninja, summoner, or something
[0:30:29] <%LailahQueenx> ya
[0:30:30] <+Frranky> agreed
[0:30:31] <+thetruewaifu> healers in general sound like a nightmare
[0:30:32] <ColRedyx> Hardest DPS is NIN or SMN, for sure.
[0:30:34] <+gwanzan> NIN has so much bullshit to remember
[0:30:36] <%Frost_Quill> I'm not terrible at summoner but I'm not amazing at it.
[0:30:36] <%Valdorick> The summoner circle
[0:30:37] <ethey16> @patstaresat what job took you the longest to rank?
[0:30:38] <SaphronBlackbourne> I saw the old tooltip for Sprint and... why
[0:30:39] <+jinshiroi> 2 minute opener
[0:30:39] <%livi242> nah summoner is easy
[0:30:40] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:30:41] <Dunmarkh> blue mage lives the hard life
[0:30:41] <nicegrandmafingers> blm is harder than smn
[0:30:42] <%Puhff> Scholar
[0:30:42] <Psyramics> SMN has too many buttons for no damn reason
[0:30:46] <T_Sasquatch> summoner level 70 is nuts
[0:30:46] <+Frranky> summoner's opener is the most counter intuitive shit
[0:30:46] <+KingCambion> its definitely annoying
[0:30:47] <nicegrandmafingers> oh
[0:30:49] <%Monkeyweed21> 5 MINUTE ROTATION IN ENDWALKER
[0:30:50] <%Agami23> healers are actually completely fine to play.
[0:30:51] <ColRedyx> Nah people are just bad.
[0:30:54] <cherrycottontail> iif hardest dps is summoner why does dragoon always die
[0:30:55] <+Grayhammatter> ninja
[0:30:55] <nicegrandmafingers> once you learn smn it's not that bad
[0:30:57] <%walternatorz> blm optimally is so fight dependent
[0:30:58] <Tracazoid> GroundMages
[0:30:59] <iosephe> yeahhhhhhhh
[0:30:59] <Bathezid> i love the pressure of playing BLM
[0:31:07] <PhilanthropyG> BLM main here. Gotta bob and step every .5 seconds between spells. Also the tether mechanics are a savior.
[0:31:07] <ColRedyx> BLM is exponentially harder the worse you are.
[0:31:08] <+BIumen> idk i'm pretty bad and i got blm down
[0:31:08] <%JoshManVGH> boy do you have to MOVE A LOT in this game.
[0:31:09] <2DSuperiority> don't drop that eno chan
[0:31:12] <%Valdorick> "I can make that cast" - Blackmages trying to DPS good
[0:31:12] <RaidenRising> i want to play this in ps4, is healer a good option for a new player?
[0:31:17] <%JustBlubs> I used to play summoner but skipped over it during stormblood and it was too big brained for me to pick back up later
[0:31:18] <ColRedyx> If you understand BLM it's a lot more forgiving than you think.
[0:31:19] <%Mekhet09> BLM is kind of boring to play.
[0:31:22] <%chance_h> To play BLM you need to balance both mana and health
[0:31:24] <%LailahQueenx> I never take blm into alliance raid anymore thanks to nier
[0:31:24] <tuesti> LUL
[0:31:24] <+jinshiroi> Warrior is easiest, Fell Cleave goes brrr
[0:31:29] <+megaman_sentinel> yeah don't f******
[0:31:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt maintaining BLMs dot is a nightmare
[0:31:32] <%Raikouija> Pats on the final raid?
[0:31:33] <+gwanzan> I love this part
[0:31:34] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt also Blackmage needs to position REALLY well
[0:31:38] <+Frranky> BLM needs encounter knowledge
[0:31:39] <+projectmanatees> @raidenrising play what you want
[0:31:44] <%Valdorick> Health is a resource on Blackmage, and your Healers will hate you.
[0:31:47] <+Grayhammatter> fire 4 is hot
[0:31:54] <+Cairo_Cat> @Cairo_Cat is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[0:32:01] <%JoshManVGH> holy shit that the experience I just had....
[0:32:02] <PhilanthropyG> Fire 4. The true Flare
[0:32:04] <SaphronBlackbourne> I really like BLM but as a baby noob I don't want to hinder people attempting to use it
[0:32:10] <%kainhighwind1990> Fire 4 might be the hottest
[0:32:11] <%JoshManVGH> I dropped Enochian like it was greased up
[0:32:11] <%chance_h> <3
[0:32:15] <GilliamYaeger> I don't think I will ever play BLM outside of open world content.
[0:32:17] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Really?!? When I started I mained Summoner and its one of the reasons I don't branch off a lot cuz I didn't think I could learn other jobs considering how indepth summoner was
[0:32:17] <2DSuperiority> yeah but doing three Fouls
[0:32:26] <%Artemis_Scowl> BLM is super cool and easy, up until the moment you have to move
[0:32:26] <TioXyco> they are unaspected, so no, they are not fire to be hot
[0:32:26] <AnnaBanana> Despair is nice
[0:32:28] <TioXyco> Kappa
[0:32:29] <$Hommando> Quad flare + double foul is great
[0:32:31] <s__o__u__l_> What is that dumb fuckin frog Ninja's summon? LUL
[0:32:33] <%bugz_munny> Can confirm - our BLM is an orbital cannon so ill heal em through shit
[0:32:34] <+Frranky> I only play BLM when it's a dungeon I know like the back of my hand
[0:32:46] <RaidenRising> really ? because the last mmo that i played was fuggin lineage 2 back in the 2000s
[0:32:50] <bigdrifter> Shhiii im to bad to play a healer
[0:32:51] <%Puhff> Blood Lotus Gang Gang
[0:32:52] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @PatStaresAt recently got my ARR relic and was gonna start a heavensward one, how would you compare the processes?
[0:32:54] <LordDudeTheFirst> I leveled my BLM in Bozja
[0:32:55] <PhilanthropyG> opening is great. Triplecasting with the tickboxes to half mp consumption feels so good
[0:32:57] <ashuckel> they don't need to build into a big hit, everything is a big hit
[0:33:03] <%Frost_Quill> but big damage
[0:33:05] <%lucky_icarus> Thats why I play MCH
[0:33:07] <+shinigami40297> BLM pre 50 is also boring as shit
[0:33:13] <+BIumen> requires poetics
[0:33:13] <blue8moon> they keep putting stuff in dungeons and raids where I can't keep up my enochian no matter what and I haaaaaaaate it
[0:33:16] <2DSuperiority> ARR relic is hell
[0:33:16] <rimi_nishimoto> realm reborn relic, big oof
[0:33:16] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> I stopped after atma
[0:33:22] <GilliamYaeger> Heavensward relic is waaaaaay easier than ARR relic.
[0:33:34] <+BIumen> also HW relics still hold up visually
[0:33:36] <twoto858> What's the best way to start the DoH classes?
[0:33:36] <%Agami23> realm reborn relics are a fucking nightmare
[0:33:39] <+Akizea> ARR's relic is the worst one to get imo
[0:33:39] <+dujam> HW relic is by far the easiest in the game
[0:33:41] <%Valdorick> Black mage becomes a class at 50, changes at 60, changes AGAIN at 70.... etc
[0:33:41] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt pre-SB tank or after?
[0:33:42] <$Ziegsy> ARR is hell, Heavensward is a cake walk
[0:33:42] <+Ben_Ben817> Just a looooot of tomestone grinding for HW
[0:33:46] <Daniel_Is_I> EVERY ONE!?
[0:33:46] <+Mycalico> @patstaresat Do you think making Enochian a trait could fix a lot of the fumbling for BLM?
[0:33:47] <PhilanthropyG> HW was the easier one?! Screw me, that was a nightmare at the time for me.
[0:33:47] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I too was unhappy
[0:33:50] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> it's not good
[0:33:54] <Nupinoop296> that sounds awful
[0:33:55] <%Dakuu75> Does Samurai have a relic weapon? Last time I played they didn't
[0:33:56] <+Frranky> ARR was the woooorst relic
[0:33:59] <%RetroCop87> Pat, what'd you decide on for a cringe-based RPG?
[0:34:00] <+Akizea> HW is by far the easiest one
[0:34:00] <$Hommando> HWs WHM relic is the only WHM relic that I like
[0:34:00] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt think we'll ever get a Chrono crossover raid?
[0:34:05] <rimi_nishimoto> its really long and you repeated a lot thing during book phase
[0:34:06] <Psyramics> ARR relics means you gotta wait for multiple FATEs to pop
[0:34:06] <%bugz_munny> ARR relics make you hate the concept of BOOKS
[0:34:08] <GilliamYaeger> Those fucking books
[0:34:09] <%bugz_munny> BOOKS
[0:34:10] <%MisterRockett> I'm at the step for the HW one where you just have to fight a bunch of dungeons with the weapon equipped.
[0:34:12] <nicegrandmafingers> the older the relic the more horrible acquistion is
[0:34:13] <SaphronBlackbourne> This fight fucks me up so hard
[0:34:14] <Nupinoop296> so it sounds like
[0:34:18] <aqua_mashu> I only did drg on arr its pain
[0:34:19] <%RetroCop87> fuck, I WAS that guy

[0:35:05] <karovus> the healers shouldve adjusted
[0:35:09] <PhilanthropyG> Also funny how I did -this- part of the raid, then did Automata 3-4 days later. Finally broke and played it. I can see why it got its praises at the time, thats a good game to come back to

[0:37:21] <Srthunda> I almost wish each race had their own animations per weapon, but I know how much that would take
[0:37:21] <SaphronBlackbourne> As a Roe I'm fine with the animations
[0:37:22] <ColRedyx> And here's where Meditate is useful.
[0:37:23] <+Grayhammatter> WutFace
[0:37:23] <%RetroCop87> can you show us what 2B's ass looks like on a male hume?
[0:37:29] <%GelatinBoi> That's my biggest beef with playing a Hroth. Had to switch back.
[0:37:29] <PhilanthropyG> hackeeeeeng
[0:37:34] <RaidenRising> and potatos?
[0:37:36] <VirtuaRailith> Roes have big ladies which is why they are the best
[0:37:42] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt how come clipping in monhun doesn't bother u as much as in other games?
[0:37:43] <+Frranky> I've been every race and gender in this game except hyur I have a fantasia addiction
[0:38:00] <%AzureGale> We Ikaruga now
[0:38:08] <%Raikouija> Has pat already beat this raid?
[0:38:18] <%RetroCop87> Tales games are clipping orgies
[0:38:18] <rehkuri> it's part of the SOUL
[0:38:19] <Srthunda> its part of the experience
[0:38:21] <DianaTheAscian> true
[0:38:26] <SaphronBlackbourne> My gay little self could not leave Roe or Hroth lol, plus my WoL became my biggest comfortable character so I'm never changing him
[0:38:30] <Louie_Salmon> It's a much harder problem for an MMO to solve, and even RPGs usually can't deal with it
[0:38:32] <SaphronBlackbourne> *comfort
[0:38:33] <Xenioplate> I don't understand what I'm looking at

[0:39:44] <%Monkeyweed21> wow Pats really bad at SAM
[0:39:47] <%kainhighwind1990> I'm running Prae rn and someone is telling me to do damage during the first ultimate fight
[0:39:52] <Mattais88> I completely forgot about the red girl in Nier.
[0:39:53] <Oxybe> BEAT UP THAT TALL CHILD! I just joined and don't know the raid context...
[0:39:58] <jahsmittsii> Attack on wife?
[0:40:07] <ItsPastas> Hair clipping doesn't bother me as much as other body parts because it's rarely animated right in any game
[0:40:10] <%chance_h> but muh Harthgar
[0:40:11] <Bathezid> i wish i could stuff my bunny ears into a big pointy hat on BLM
[0:40:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Viera clipping isn't THAT bad
[0:40:17] <+gwanzan> I disable hats most of the time, anyways
[0:40:21] <%the38bandit> i hate the hair for bunnies, the clapping is crazy
[0:40:41] <%BoxNavy> they  WILL clip
[0:40:44] <blue8moon> viera hair clips with their bodies very badly
[0:40:44] <%kainhighwind1990> @Mattais88 same
[0:40:45] <%MisterRockett> They don't expect any of the bunnies to tank
[0:40:45] <%velemi> Pat, some viera face accessories float off their faces
[0:40:47] <+Frranky> oh my god I never noticed the dark knight sword clipping now I can't play that job now thanks pat
[0:40:48] <+dujam> nothing worse than literally every bard weapon having arrows in the back quiver that clip through hats
[0:40:50] <ColRedyx> I would forfeit hats to get Hrothgar hairstyles and features separated from the base face options.
[0:40:50] <DianaTheAscian> I always play with glasses on my Viera
[0:40:54] <GilliamYaeger> My preferred Viera hairstyle has these awful long sidebangs that go down across her chest that clip through FUCKING EVERYTHING! I can't wear anything that has a collar of any kind or else it just looks godawful. I yearn for a mod that just cuts those damn things off.
[0:40:54] <%RetroCop87> DON'T BLAME US
[0:40:56] <TioXyco> @the38bandit the only clapping on female viera is their asscheeks Kappa
[0:40:58] <%BoxNavy> hroths and vieras clip super hard
[0:41:00] <RaidenRising> but potatos
[0:41:02] <+projectmanatees> Wow that other alliance ate it
[0:41:04] <+SuicidalLemmming> i dont see any clipping of the shoulders
[0:41:05] <SpookyBeef7> As an Au Ra with a pompadour, I usually have helmets disabled most of the time anyway, but I can understand why people dislike Viera not having ANY hat options.
[0:41:06] <iosephe> johns
[0:41:12] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I'm just bad at using SAM's meter, i always have way too much

[0:42:18] <%Agami23> how is your desynth levels pat?
[0:42:20] <GilliamYaeger> @TheFramedWarlock With ACT :V  More seriously, with practice
[0:42:21] <ColRedyx> @Dakuu75 The chains are forced movement.  If you get one you look at the direction the arrows on her hand are pointing and move the opposite direction so you don't get run into the wall.
[0:42:23] <%BoxNavy> popadopolous
[0:42:24] <@SSaryn> You start seeing bullshit.

[0:43:19] <ColRedyx> Not exactly ignoring, but if you can't look through a game's UI then how do you look through a dirty windshield to drive?
[0:43:20] <xeros720> and shut up if you call them something else
[0:43:21] <Oxybe> oh god it's me playing hunting horn
[0:43:21] <%BoxNavy> i still have a bad habit of looking at my hotbar
[0:43:26] <+gwanzan> I can't remember skill names for shit
[0:43:26] <%RetroCop87> how many of them start or end with "Dragon"?
[0:43:30] <Psyramics> hard slash, harder slash, hardest slash
[0:43:30] <GilliamYaeger> The only DRK skill I know is THE BLACKEST NIGHT
[0:43:32] <+Ben_Ben817> Blackest Night is a good one
[0:43:32] <%Agami23> living dead
[0:43:32] <pitabears> just use TBN
[0:43:37] <%Frost_Quill> energy drain
[0:43:39] <%shurtal> Carve and spit or something?
[0:43:43] <%MisterRockett> I can describe the functions xD
[0:43:45] <%Artemis_Scowl> TBN is the best
[0:43:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt i only know blackest night and living dead
[0:43:46] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I'm fine at Ninjutsu unless I think about it
[0:43:49] <+Grayhammatter> delirium
[0:43:52] <%0rond> say random edgy names and dark knight probably has a skil llike that
[0:43:52] <ergheisu> ive played samurai for 4 years and I still have no idea what the names of the aoes are
[0:43:54] <+Frranky> as a gunbreaker main TBN makes me jealous
[0:43:57] <%Monkeyweed21> I love Martin Lawrence
[0:43:58] <DianaTheAscian> ITS SO GOOD
[0:43:58] <%0rond> blood spiller
[0:44:00] <RocketBarrel> Isnt the potency on Salted Earth like really bad?
[0:44:02] <+Frranky> but then I do more damage and I'm fine
[0:44:02] <@SSaryn> Congrats DRK, you have the best Defensive CD in exchange for the worst Invuln.
[0:44:03] <TioXyco> TBN is double tap L2 + Right
[0:44:11] <Tracazoid> I don't even know what the basic attack is named on my White Mage anymore, the only skills i know by name are the ones from other FF like Cure, Esuna and Holy.
[0:44:13] <%Rumbutt> RED AND BLUE
[0:44:17] <%MisterRockett> THERE'S A 3RD, PAT!
[0:44:21] <GilliamYaeger> TBN is the best tank. DRK is probably the worst tank, but TBN is the best.
[0:44:22] <+jinshiroi> All I know is Fell Cleave go brrr
[0:44:22] <%MisterRockett> SAM HAS 3 AOES
[0:44:26] <%Dakuu75> their names are "AOE-1" and "AOE-2"
[0:44:28] <%RetroCop87> those sound like Zanpaktos
[0:44:28] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> shoutout to dragoon for the easy to remember "high jump"

[0:44:40] <DianaTheAscian> AND*
[0:44:45] <SaphronBlackbourne> @RocketBarrel Yeah, but it's free extra damage so there's no real reason not to use it
[0:44:48] <hakumaribo> spooky stack?
[0:44:50] <%Frost_Quill> "White mage has the cures, esuna...glare...the shield move...the big aoe heals..."

[0:45:08] <%Dapper_Cactuar> most people I know call them "gamer points"
[0:45:09] <TioXyco> or rather "The collection" ?
[0:45:09] <%0rond> I never heard this term in  my life
[0:45:09] <DianaTheAscian> I just say vul

[0:45:24] <GilliamYaeger> Go for the high score pat
[0:45:25] <%Valdorick> 2K hp, jesus christ
[0:45:26] <xeros720> yeah, the "you fucked up" stack
[0:45:28] <37calorieghost> the only scholar skill i can actually name is excog
[0:45:37] <+Grayhammatter> and dead
[0:45:38] <+Kiaayo> i call them "fuck ups"
[0:45:39] <orbulon> Yoko‚Äôs touch
[0:45:39] <LoreKeeper_Thal> the funnee stacks
[0:45:40] <Strongfish91> vuln stacks
[0:45:42] <blue8moon> "spooky stacks"
[0:45:42] <%shurtal> Spooky stacks sound like scooby snacks
[0:45:42] <Oxybe> Ah a fuckup counter
[0:45:44] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[0:45:45] <ItsPastas> I call em "error stickers" since you usually get one when you fuck up
[0:45:46] <+jinshiroi> 14 is the highest i've seen for vulns
[0:45:46] <GilliamYaeger> They're DPS uptime stacks
[0:45:48] <SaphronBlackbourne> Me and my friends just call them vuln stacks
[0:45:49] <%shurtal> Oopsies
[0:45:51] <ItsPastas> The more, the more fuckups you've done
[0:45:53] <%Fidel_Castbro> i call them Healer Trusts
[0:45:55] <%Frost_Quill> I don't even know what scholar's main heal is called and I have it at 80.
[0:45:56] <+Ben_Ben817> The uh oh stack
[0:45:58] <37calorieghost> "yikes piles"

[0:46:01] <%Valdorick> 6 stacks, very dangerous.
[0:46:02] <xeros720> hehe yeah, i'm curious how that came about
[0:46:03] <%kainhighwind1990> I call them uh ohs
[0:46:03] <PanicSwytch> Why we talkin about scooby snacks
[0:46:04] <adagalli> +1 for "error stickers"
[0:46:07] <%Monkeyweed21> is it Starboard or Larboard?
[0:46:10] <ne0bunny> stacks of shame
[0:46:15] <%Artemis_Scowl> "Idiot tallys" is a good one
[0:46:20] <%psidefx> tHE fUCK-uP fiLES
[0:46:22] <Sol_Install> ooo
[0:46:24] <RaidenRising> kek
[0:46:25] <xeros720> the rich lore of guilty gear
[0:46:26] <adagalli> @adagalli is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:46:26] <%RetroCop87> *coughwooliecough*
[0:46:27] <+gwanzan> the "story"
[0:46:30] <%Dakuu75> UUUUUUHHHH, are we going to jail for this boss fight?
[0:46:31] <Srthunda> I read the wiki
[0:46:32] <+kewlmyc> Just going to throw Woolie's videos under the bus huh?
[0:46:32] <%Frodiddly> literally no other way
[0:46:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I love the COMPLETE sandbagging of Woolie LUL
[0:46:39] <+burntbagels13> Enjoying the stream while on my exercise bike even though I have no idea what is going on.
[0:46:40] <Sol_Install> i mean they have a manga and all the story videos on the youtube channel
[0:46:41] <%RetroCop87> YOU WEEBS
[0:46:41] <%Deft_Thought> The look of gameplay in FFXIV is tight but I have a serious aversion to MMOs
[0:46:41] <%Fidel_Castbro> stinky Samurais
[0:46:41] <%Higure_yoru> HeyGuys
[0:46:43] <$Ziegsy> aurum vale points
[0:46:43] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Lemme tell you about the Backyard real quick
[0:46:45] <%AzureGale> A lot of weebs
[0:46:45] <%Frost_Quill> There are 5.
[0:46:46] <+Kiaayo> impossible
[0:46:46] <derekwst3> some guy named woolievs is also doing a history of, not sure if you heard of him
[0:46:47] <+MKevin98> is the story for guilty gear worth it lmao
[0:46:47] <%Axellogic> WEEB ARMY
[0:46:48] <%BoxNavy> who the hell is woolie
[0:46:51] <$KnivesEve> 5 sam
[0:46:51] <PhilanthropyG> in a convention?
[0:46:51] <+ChaosedStar> Hey look its an entoner
[0:46:54] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Who's the ghost?
[0:46:54] <DianaTheAscian> I thought streaming the GG story was a no no ?
[0:46:54] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM is baby's first melee DPS
[0:46:56] <Sol_Install> also GG story is better than MK tbh
[0:46:57] <%kainhighwind1990> This boss is a Drakengard 3 reference, right?
[0:46:59] <xeros720> what's a woolie, seriously
[0:47:02] <Sol_Install> since it doesn't time travel 3 times
[0:47:08] <2DSuperiority> if the Nier 5.55 stuff doesn't end in us getting weapons I will be big sad
[0:47:08] <+zdemented> theres no other way to get gg lore Kappa Kappa
[0:47:09] <%AzureGale> We Touken Ranbu now?
[0:47:13] <%Fidel_Castbro> I'm so happy for reaper because hopefully it means people switch off Samurai and they stop stealing my Monk Gear
[0:47:14] <+GrandmasterBFunk> oh wait the ghost was a NIN, i honestly forgot they can do that
[0:47:15] <%RetroCop87> When is Final Fantasy XIV going to introduce the cowboy class?
[0:47:17] <Oxybe> Should I do Fortnite quests or go play helping horn in Mon Hunt @patstaresat
[0:47:20] <%bugz_munny> Its a Yoko Taro universe reference
[0:47:25] <SaphronBlackbourne> When I was running Prae to get my Kamuy I was in a part of 3 SAMs, two ASTs I think, and 2 Paladins
[0:47:27] <adagalli> paying attention is for healers and tanks!
[0:47:28] <%Frost_Quill> @kainhighwind1990 Nier itself is a Drakengard reference if we're being honest.
[0:47:32] <%Dakuu75> what're those red chains i'm seeing among the players?
[0:47:37] <+gwanzan> @Deft_Thought XIV is probably the best Final Fantasy game
[0:47:38] <$Ziegsy> Pats fc seems like a bunch of funky people
[0:47:39] <%AzureGale> The ghost was a Nine Inch Nails?
[0:47:44] <GilliamYaeger> @RetroCop87 If you're okay with Steampunk Cowboy, that's Machinist.
[0:47:47] <2DSuperiority> Drakengard is a real life reference
[0:47:48] <DianaTheAscian> Ky having a panic attack or being Sol's son in law is amazing
[0:47:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Dakuu75 that's a Dragoon skill
[0:47:54] <ColRedyx> @Dakuu75 A Dragoon buff on themselves and one other player.
[0:47:55] <%bugz_munny> i mean thats fine too
[0:47:58] <+projectmanatees> Wonder if the dragoon population will thin due to reaper
[0:48:02] <cosmicgoatee> in the words of Plinkett, "You might not have noticed, but your brain did"
[0:48:06] <+Grayhammatter> that's fine
[0:48:07] <%AzureGale> Eh that could have been worse
[0:48:08] <%Frodiddly> Frodiddly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 7 month streak! praise orb
[0:48:09] <DianaTheAscian> eh this works
[0:48:16] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Yo what‚Äôs up bitch muffin?
[0:48:17] <$HairballCT> tasty
[0:48:20] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[0:48:23] <%chance_h> Style points, gotta get that SSS rating
[0:48:25] <%Deft_Thought> @projectmanatees Are Dragoons a popular DPS?
[0:48:28] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:48:29] <ColRedyx> @Dakuu75 They lose it if they go too far apart which is why they show the tether so you can keep track of your partner's position.
[0:48:29] <T_Sasquatch> the only class i know a, kst
[0:48:29] <+hush_wolf> flavor town?
[0:48:29] <adagalli> @Deft_Thought VoteYea VoteYea
[0:48:30] <%NitronStreams> Pat your only flavor is salt
[0:48:34] <2DSuperiority> Quick! The Dragoon fandom is dying! RT to kill it faster!
[0:48:41] <%Agami23> dragoon is the easiest one to play.
[0:48:41] <T_Sasquatch> well that didnt come out right
[0:48:43] <+Frranky> and then reaper's gonna steal it from samurai
[0:48:43] <+Grayhammatter> will guy fieri ever find flavor town?
[0:48:49] <xeros720> samurai and rdm i think
[0:48:49] <%Valdorick> Only Black Mage tanks the floor better than Blackmage
[0:48:50] <%bugz_munny> Dragoon is the new cool
[0:48:52] <+Mrbaconator> which class sucks the most
[0:48:53] <%Deft_Thought> I always liked Dragoons.
[0:48:53] <%Valdorick> Dragoon*
[0:48:55] <+ChaosedStar> So how does backstab positional stuff work in fights like this?
[0:48:55] <Bathezid> how is monk these days? i heard they got reworked at some point but haven't played since last summer
[0:48:55] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM are weebs that suck too hard to do positionals, DRG are cool, MNK are masochists that prolly abuse amphetamines, NIN are weebs that can do positionals and screw up mudras
[0:48:57] <%Frost_Quill> Dragoon is my main physical dps, but I use red mage and summoner way more.
[0:48:58] <%JoshManVGH> Reaper shall steal it again
[0:49:03] <%bugz_munny> And then Dragoon will REALLY be cool
[0:49:03] <Ner234> The EDGE
[0:49:07] <%spitelite> dragoons are more popular as a tank
[0:49:09] <GilliamYaeger> @Mrbaconator Scholar. Poor, poor Scholar.
[0:49:11] <$Hommando> Male Au'ra just got edgier
[0:49:12] <T_Sasquatch> ninja is so cool
[0:49:14] <+kittenloaf> what's the funnest class? i've only played mechanist
[0:49:16] <+Shoosler> hurr durr "floor tank" duuhhhh
[0:49:16] <+Grayhammatter> ow, the edge
[0:49:18] <DianaTheAscian> I see Summoners and Sams a lot
[0:49:24] <%BoxNavy> RDM is the only class i play
[0:49:24] <%Monkeyweed21> DPS IN NEED WAS WILD
[0:49:26] <%Artemis_Scowl> There's gonna be so many Reaper Male Viera..... And I'm going to be one
[0:49:28] <%Monkeyweed21> THE FART CLOUD
[0:49:30] <%rDAKODAc> It helps that Estinien is cool
[0:49:30] <%AzureGale> Turn on Darkseid, yeaaaaaaaaaaaah
[0:49:32] <+projectmanatees> Sage will steal scholar
[0:49:34] <RaidenRising> ow the edge
[0:49:35] <%Agami23> dragoon only has one really long rotation, which makes it good for braindeads.
[0:49:36] <37calorieghost> leave scholar alone we're trying our best
[0:49:41] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Is this Nier stuff?
[0:49:42] <%JoshManVGH> Pat, is Endwalker going to be a Chrono Trigger?
[0:49:42] <ItsPastas> I wonder if Reapers are gonna be as big of floor tanks as dragoons
[0:49:46] <%Monkeyweed21> THE DARKSIDE FART CLOUD
[0:49:46] <%Valdorick> "oh wow, people want me to do stuff"
[0:49:47] <Oxybe> but tanking fun...
[0:49:49] <adagalli> who said bad things about scholar?!?!?!
[0:49:52] <Revzero25> i love being a tnk
[0:49:53] <+keiji_maede> Ninja was too fucking much..... I saw them everywhere
[0:49:53] <%weissguard> yeyeye
[0:49:56] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:49:58] <%bugz_munny> Scholar is probably getting buffed to the same level of Sage
[0:49:58] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder how many people in the raid who don't know Pat think he's new to the raid.
[0:50:00] <T_Sasquatch> i would never tank a trial or raid , thats too much pressure
[0:50:02] <+gwanzan> is this the sexiest boss in the whole game?
[0:50:02] <%Deft_Thought> Gunbreaker seemed interesting but that's as someone who's only seen the game as an outsider
[0:50:02] <adagalli> GOOD
[0:50:03] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Everyone is looking at you on tank
[0:50:06] <%bugz_munny> I forsee another healer rework
[0:50:09] <+ALazo> I've been levelling all classes and I'm so ready to stop playing dps
[0:50:13] <%BoxNavy> tanking is scawy :(
[0:50:14] <+coldsama> What's the least played class?
[0:50:16] <adagalli> thats why we glam bruh
[0:50:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Everyone should talk bad about Scholar, legit the worst healers. Barely viable
[0:50:18] <+gwanzan> those hips...
[0:50:20] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY HAD A GOOD ONE IN HEAVENSWARD
[0:50:22] <nevan_44> it is LUL
[0:50:26] <ColRedyx> @Frost_Quill Most people wouldn't even notice.
[0:50:27] <+Qexec> bard
[0:50:27] <%Dakuu75> whm
[0:50:29] <%Deft_Thought> Astro?
[0:50:29] <Daniel_Is_I> AST I'd guess
[0:50:30] <%the22cstomp> monk
[0:50:30] <+PharosOfLight> it feels like it's Monk
[0:50:32] <TheCoobie> WAR or SMN
[0:50:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> mnk
[0:50:34] <+projectmanatees> Art of war is a good move
[0:50:34] <AdmiralButtloaf> astro
[0:50:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BRD
[0:50:35] <Sheveniner> Least played is Monk.
[0:50:35] <+fatmatt1712> Love my gun breaker tho, tanking is the way I like to play the game
[0:50:36] <count_bob> bard
[0:50:36] <%Agami23> monk sucks
[0:50:36] <+Frranky> it's monk
[0:50:36] <DianaTheAscian> SCH is a struggle
[0:50:37] <SaphronBlackbourne> Whenever I hear about SCH I've only heard people say it sucks to play right now
[0:50:38] <T_Sasquatch> i actually prefer barrier healing to regular healing
[0:50:38] <xeros720> yeah, scholars are good, astrologians though, i feel bad for them
[0:50:38] <%the38bandit> astro
[0:50:38] <velozity> is that zero
[0:50:38] <37calorieghost> the hw gauntlets are my fav
[0:50:39] <%Frost_Quill> Monk or bard probs.
[0:50:40] <GilliamYaeger> Monk.
[0:50:41] <Calamity2007> The Red Girl battle still messes me up out of all the fights in the Paradigm Tower raid
[0:50:42] <tuesti> i think monk
[0:50:43] <+seoliart> AST/MNK/BRD probably
[0:50:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Bard
[0:50:44] <+poysendemon> hggBanger
[0:50:47] <%JoshManVGH> WAR is fun though
[0:50:48] <ItsPastas> The only downside to tanking is that I gotta look up guides before doing new raids because fucking up the mechanics for everyone else terrifies me
[0:50:50] <%bugz_munny> you're crazy if you say WHM
[0:50:50] <WakeUpThrow> My money's on BRD
[0:50:50] <$Hommando> No way it's white mage
[0:50:50] <Strongfish91> bard imo
[0:50:51] <adagalli> maybe SMN
[0:50:51] <%Artemis_Scowl> Blue Mage LUL
[0:50:55] <%Agami23> WHM is vital
[0:50:56] <iosephe> Really?
[0:50:57] <%Dakuu75> OH, I love being wrong like that
[0:50:58] <%the22cstomp> whm is ez healer
[0:51:00] <Calamity2007> @TheCoobie I am surprised with WAR, it is pretty damn fun, even if I prefer DRK
[0:51:00] <+burntbagels13> Is this mass effect music?
[0:51:00] <ColRedyx> Yeah MNK is least played, then BRD and BLM
[0:51:01] <%AzureGale> Everybody loves healers
[0:51:02] <RaidenRising> healing is fun
[0:51:03] <PhilanthropyG> Least popular: Dark Knight, White Mage, Machinist, Monk.Nov. 25, 2018. Finding newer info
[0:51:04] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I literally do not understand people who can't tank because of nerves or something, you do the exact same stuff but sometimes you have to press a button to mitigate tank busters
[0:51:07] <CometCat24> wouldn't be surprised if it was bard
[0:51:12] <%Frost_Quill> kaine
[0:51:12] <%bhp_99> That's a dedicated healer class right?
[0:51:13] <T_Sasquatch> i rarely see monks and im a monk main
[0:51:15] <+gwanzan> love this song
[0:51:17] <%chance_h> it's hard to get a good read because bots and beginners
[0:51:23] <Ids560> Blue mage seems like it's cheating as an answer to least played
[0:51:23] <adagalli> SMN for sure, all the arcanists see the light at lvl 30
[0:51:27] <%VioletHeart> According to FF14 Census it's Dancer, but the DLC classes all have fewer players
[0:51:31] <StaticEntry> maybe bacuase WHM gets its own mount
[0:51:32] <Calamity2007> @PhilanthropyG I refuse to think that is the same now, especially with Shadowbringers
[0:51:33] <tuesti> it has to be monk or bard as least played
[0:51:36] <+projectmanatees> It‚Äôs the only healer you get at start
[0:51:38] <$Ziegsy> TBF whm gives a free mount
[0:51:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> it's the most recognizable ff class imo
[0:51:41] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when you had to level WHM to be a PLD
[0:51:47] <SaphronBlackbourne> WHM was my second 80
[0:51:49] <corn_dad> WHM is the only default healer
[0:51:50] <adagalli> dancer is a class??
[0:51:53] <SaphronBlackbourne> I planned to main healer
[0:51:54] <Calamity2007> WHM is also the simplest of the healer classes though I love AST more
[0:51:58] <%AzureGale> GET REKT ALLIANCE C NEWB
[0:52:03] <+kittenloaf> which class is the most fun to play
[0:52:03] <+Grayhammatter> oop, someone died to traffic
[0:52:12] <%JohnAtDawn> THIS SONG
[0:52:13] <ergheisu> @GrandmasterBFunk i used to have tank fright too, it's because if you're the MT you think everyone is staring at you
[0:52:13] <ColRedyx> Yeah WHM leads by miles.
[0:52:15] <%chance_h> @adagalli ranged melee class
[0:52:15] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:52:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> yes and I love it @adagalli aoe  go brr
[0:52:16] <%Dakuu75> @Ziegsy oh YEAH~! I forgot. that was my first mount. lol
[0:52:17] <37calorieghost> this raid ending with kaine's theme is great but i really wanted the stupid fuckin bells
[0:52:18] <%RetroCop87> I fecking love this song
[0:52:18] <%seoliart> seoliart subscribed with Prime. 
[0:52:18] <+ChaosedStar> holy shit dem legs n hips
[0:52:20] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @adagalli Look for the people using rings as weapons in this fight, those are dancers
[0:52:24] <%Deft_Thought> Machinist seems neat. If I ever play XIV, I'd be down to give them a try
[0:52:24] <%Shirousuke1989> What's the best support class in your opinion?
[0:52:30] <SilverFeng> ff14 census says DNC and GNB are lowest on active characters
[0:52:32] <DianaTheAscian> Most fun is very subjective
[0:52:34] <PhilanthropyG> if we not include the new Gunbreaker and Dancer classes......AST, MCH, and SCH.
[0:52:36] <adagalli> @adagalli lol i was being facetious
[0:52:37] <ogpurpledaddy> bard rotation fun af
[0:52:39] <DianaTheAscian> It is
[0:52:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeyeye
[0:52:41] <+Tetherline> Kappa
[0:52:42] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM is babys first Melee DPS
[0:52:42] <KahnWick> I wonder what the % is for people who leveled bard only for performance?
[0:52:44] <PhilanthropyG> last updated April 2020
[0:52:45] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:52:47] <DianaTheAscian> Dancer
[0:52:48] <%chance_h> RDM because rez mid fight
[0:52:49] <nevan_44> :)
[0:52:51] <%Agami23> dance partner is nuts
[0:52:52] <cosmicgoatee> incredibly edgy
[0:52:53] <Gravega> How is this Final Fantasy? Plays exactly like any WOW clone. LuvUok
[0:52:55] <%BoxNavy> i hate samurais sound effects
[0:52:56] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:52:56] <%velemi> RDM is better in lower-tier content
[0:52:57] <LordDudeTheFirst> DNC makes my brain hurt
[0:53:01] <ergheisu> Samurai was fun in stormblood, back when hagakure was important
[0:53:03] <%0rond> RDM is the best support class realistically
[0:53:04] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt and Ninja
[0:53:06] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Dancer is the most fun class tbh, even though i main DRK
[0:53:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MNK has amazing support skills
[0:53:09] <Nordguy> you get to pick who's top DPS
[0:53:09] <Calamity2007> @Monkeyweed21 Probably because they start so leveled up. I wonder if Reaper will be that once it drops
[0:53:10] <%MrBorisMakarov> DNC AOE GO BRRRRRR
[0:53:12] <PhilanthropyG> reading straight from XIV Census
[0:53:15] <$Ziegsy> @Gravega itsin the story
[0:53:26] <ne0bunny> I love DNC
[0:53:28] <+Shoosler> RDM is the most fun to play imo
[0:53:30] <ergheisu> but everyone said "no, i want to midare more" so they removed hagakure as a vital ability
[0:53:32] <%seoliart> I love RDM chain rezzing LUL
[0:53:33] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpRtsd rdm rez
[0:53:38] <xeros720> rdm is the best dps to have in randoms, it's true
[0:53:38] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Wait, is this Drakenguard final boss?
[0:53:43] <Calamity2007> For physical DPS I want to learn DRG or NIN
[0:53:43] <+pandamancer224> rez mage best support
[0:53:48] <Calamity2007> I love RDM
[0:53:49] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:53:50] <adagalli> am i the only person who feels like a traitor when i dont play my main
[0:53:56] <%BoxNavy> im helping :)
[0:53:58] <Calamity2007> RDM is my favorite magic class by far
[0:54:03] <37calorieghost> isnt ninja only a support cuz ta is insane?
[0:54:04] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt is everyone being knocked back after you normal? or is that lag?
[0:54:09] <Calamity2007> Maybe it is because I like the flow of its skills
[0:54:14] <PhilanthropyG> For funsies, MOST played are WHM, ARC (does not split SMN and SCH), BLM, PLD
[0:54:20] <%bugz_munny> Its fun to switch it up
[0:54:20] <%Dakuu75> it's not gonna kill you
[0:54:24] <+Frranky> man six months is so far away
[0:54:24] <+projectmanatees> @0rond it‚Äôs normal
[0:54:33] <+GrandmasterBFunk> nah i like to get away from my main every once in a while
[0:54:35] <DianaTheAscian> I switch it up all the time
[0:54:36] <%seoliart> That's why I have a dps/tank/healer main :)
[0:54:41] <$Ziegsy> whenever estinien sees me as anything but a DRG I feel hes judging me
[0:54:42] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt So the WoW Classic Pre-patch for TBC has been delayed due to bugs from 3 pm today to 10 pm. Fucking Blizzard I cannot make this shit up
[0:54:49] <bigdrifter> RDM is fun but i prefer DRG so i can braindead the rotation
[0:54:55] <adagalli> @PhilanthropyG Y NO SPLIT?!
[0:55:07] <%chance_h> damage is calculated locally then confirmed by the server
[0:55:14] <%the22cstomp> it goes down a list
[0:55:14] <Calamity2007> @Alazull I can't believe people still play it.
[0:55:23] <%Dakuu75> oh yeah, it's like a chain-lightning effect
[0:55:23] <%0rond> you know  I did ultra vibration only kills enemies one at a time
[0:55:26] <blue8moon> sometimes this means that people can survive things they shouldn't
[0:55:31] <rehkuri> it's very easy to tell by pulling a big stack and throwing out an assize
[0:55:32] <ergheisu> if i switched to samurai in Stormblood and am now switching to Reaper in Endwalker, am I an edgechaser
[0:55:34] <+Frranky> I guess I'll use the six months to finally level all the gatherers and crafters
[0:55:35] <Calamity2007> The Red Girl battle still messes me up out of all the fights in the Paradigm Tower raid
[0:55:37] <iosephe> it's very satisfying
[0:55:44] <Shin_goob> I like the chunky noises
[0:55:44] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> hearing that with big crits is so satisfying
[0:55:46] <%Monkeyweed21> the holy BWAP
[0:55:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> My internet died ;n;
[0:55:51] <@CreepyPorpoise> AND NOW I DIED
[0:55:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> OH NO
[0:55:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> I can watch myself die but I can't stop it

[0:56:32] <$Hommando> Your tank pulled off a clutch superbolide
[0:56:33] <%BoxNavy> s u p e r f u c k i n g b o l l i d  e
[0:56:34] <@CreepyPorpoise> Hello everyone, how's it feel out here in the audience
[0:56:35] <%watchmanfury> man this raids super cool
[0:56:38] <%bugz_munny> yup
[0:56:38] <Priapeia> I feel Hallowed ground is the worst with that
[0:56:40] <$Hommando> Benediction actually has cast time
[0:56:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> superbolide aka are my healers paying attention @patstaresat
[0:56:43] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @Calamity2007 The phase were she makes the clones and spins arround with cone AOE's gets me every time, i always end up with at least 3 stacks of damage up
[0:56:48] <ergheisu> it feels like benediction and arm's length are actually just coded badly
[0:56:53] <blue8moon> I love watching benediction go off on a corpse
[0:56:53] <ergheisu> or something
[0:56:58] <%bugz_munny> bene has a long ANIMATION
[0:56:59] <Shin_goob> i never use living dead because i dont want to give my healer a heart attack
[0:57:02] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> Pat the vuln stack god
[0:57:03] <+DormaKazzy> I feel like benediction is a HELL OF A LOT BETTER than ARR days though
[0:57:06] <+jinshiroi> hollowed ground, but died anyway, but also hollow is in cooldown
[0:57:07] <37calorieghost> server ticks are what makes pets shit huh
[0:57:09] <%bugz_munny> and server tick kick in
[0:57:13] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt You can cancel devotion by hitting a button to fast
[0:57:15] <tuesti> that's the worst feeling when i'm like oh shit i gotta benediction and i was .1 second to late
[0:57:17] <+projectmanatees> Healers who don‚Äôt use dots are the worst
[0:57:17] <+Mycalico> @patstaresat you think they can increase server tick when ps4 stops being supported?
[0:57:19] <%Monkeyweed21> I dont miss the nonsense of Cleric Stance lagging out
[0:57:19] <adagalli> @Shin_goob we SCHs thank you
[0:57:21] <+Frranky> FUCK
[0:57:21] <%Daxalog> Whats the penalty for dying anyway?
[0:57:21] <Calamity2007> @GrandmasterBFunk Also the colored laser phase right before the dual meteors mess me up
[0:57:21] <@SSaryn> Someone's gonna get 99.
[0:57:22] <$Ziegsy> he wont get it

[0:57:54] <Calamity2007> @bugz_munny Bene is problamatic since you have to wonder if you should use it or expect the other healer to pick up

[1:00:12] <xeros720> he hop
[1:00:12] <$Hommando> Remember when auto-face wasn't a thing and you'd constantly drop spells as a caster when an enemy walked out of your line of sight?
[1:00:14] <%CalderGaming> @jinshiroi lots of retainers, probably
[1:00:15] <+gwanzan> Pat's stubby son

Watching Fanfest sparked my interest in XIV and I decided to create a fresh account for the free trial cause I'm a crazy person. Here's to a year of supporting you and your equally crazy opinions.
[1:00:17] <DianaTheAscian> thats cool
[1:00:17] <Shin_goob> they get the minion right but fuck up the actual model
[1:00:18] <Calamity2007> @MoonKing I might try that out then.
[1:00:19] <iosephe> it's how they move
[1:00:19] <+GrandmasterBFunk> that animation is very flaoty haha
[1:00:23] <Brandon__Brando> zangief come back
[1:00:25] <FortuneEX> LUL
[1:00:27] <%solracc25> This cannot continue
[1:00:27] <%MisterRockett> It tries to punch you
[1:00:30] <AsagiRyuu> pat whats your overall thoughts on the bozja content? do you love it or hate it or whatever
[1:00:31] <+Shoosler> @jinshiroi there's a macro button you can make that auto sorts the inventory whenever you open it
[1:00:32] <Calamity2007> Ganguro 2P
[1:00:34] <%BoxNavy> stubby......
[1:00:40] <%psidefx> psaDogchamp
[1:00:40] <%StrawberryPantsu> Glorious Goojob?
[1:00:41] <Calamity2007> It is closer to her SoulCal 6 appearance
[1:00:42] <+kyrona2> Scholar is great  Esp for damage in high end content.  I don't understand how people in chat can call it awful
[1:01:00] <%Garthunox> im not even gonna waste my time getting the tome belt
[1:01:01] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Honestly this endgame gear progression is the worst part of the game and takes way too much grinding
[1:01:03] <%AzureGale> F
[1:01:10] <ergheisu> did you just
[1:01:11] <Calamity2007> @kyrona2 It probably just has one of the biggest learning curves of the jobs.
[1:01:12] <adagalli> people hate on sch because they dont understand us
[1:01:13] <%Fidel_Castbro> haha spend your Clusters stinky
[1:01:14] <+projectmanatees> Chat are cowards who can‚Äôt play sch
[1:01:17] <nevan_44> NotLikeThis
[1:01:23] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt pat the 2p has the same skin tone its just the white dress primes your eye and makes you think you see a different shade. its a common trick artists use all the time
[1:01:25] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt If you hit square on the controller it auto select the item asked
[1:01:31] <37calorieghost> @kyrona2 actually healing with it is hard when your static is mid lmao
[1:01:37] <AdmiralButtloaf> do you like the bozjan tank armor or the elemental +1 tank set more
[1:01:39] <%bugz_munny> that aint bad
[1:01:40] <nicegrandmafingers> endgame gear progression is just doing raids
[1:01:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> Fashion works.
[1:01:44] <doc_ock_rokc> So why is pat human
[1:01:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's alright.
[1:01:46] <%AllenDeadman> nice
[1:01:46] <nicegrandmafingers> or having money if you cant
[1:01:46] <MoonKing> @calamity2007, a fast clear is like 10 minutes so that's roughly 1 tome per minute which is as good, and you also have chance for auricite and gwibers
[1:01:48] <+SuicidalLemmming> whyd you move it into your inventory?
[1:01:49] <JeysJumbleJams> ooo
[1:01:50] <animaturgy> Nice hat
[1:01:51] <%watchmanfury> fresh as fuck
[1:01:52] <Shin_goob> that coat looks comfy
[1:01:53] <+cascadepersona> My thoughts exactly.

[1:02:16] <%solracc25> pirate pat
[1:02:17] <Ianrazz> Is there a way to not horribly destroy the materia or nah? I don't know what determines the %
[1:02:19] <+Shoosler> does anyone know - is there a way in the game or with addon to make player names smaller? just a smaller font size
[1:02:19] <%bugz_munny> there we go
[1:02:19] <%Nobrev> the textures don't have to be stretched over a massive roegadyn frame
[1:02:21] <Brandon__Brando> the true game is here
[1:02:23] <TheGammaBear> Fashion Fantasy 14!
[1:02:26] <%bugz_munny> WORK IT PAT WORK IT

[1:02:34] <%Dakuu75> I think... the last armor set I got for sam was Ironworks (dunno what comes next)
[1:02:41] <+Frranky> cryptlurker maiming is going to look so good on reaper
[1:02:42] <%kysath> Hey Pat, was wondering if you known what people are talking about when they say you need to have good latency for MCH. @PatStaresAt

[1:02:48] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt Thats purple
[1:02:58] <+OnyxMemory> I've always though they should make a mount for collecting the 4,8,12 savage mounts in a tier. maybe then we could have gotten titan car
[1:03:01] <%bugz_munny> Bojzan sets are so good
[1:03:03] <+cascadepersona> How do you have so much money?
[1:03:05] <+MayorRev> pat thats blue
[1:03:05] <%bugz_munny> Only good WHM coat

[1:03:47] <%chance_h> I miss playing this game but i quit in the middle of reorganizing my bags a year ago
[1:03:48] <Sydin18> I see that shoebill :>
[1:03:49] <+projectmanatees> Pat isn‚Äôt moth man he has money
[1:03:49] <%Fidel_Castbro> the power of coffee biscuits
[1:03:54] <AnnaBanana> Bozja is far from dead
[1:03:55] <%Dakuu75> @Calamity2007 Cool, thanks
[1:03:56] <ethey16> @patstaresat how many hours do you have in this game?
[1:04:01] <+kyrona2> @Calamity2007 It does, but it isn't as hard to learn as playing ast super optimally imo
[1:04:03] <Sydin18> I SEE THAT FROG SUIt
[1:04:03] <AnnaBanana> People are rushing to complete their stuff before patch comes
[1:04:06] <Calamity2007> @Faustgesicht Not as big of a drop off as Eureka was for sure
[1:04:10] <SaphronBlackbourne> I could only bring myself to level ALC
[1:04:13] <%bugz_munny> Bozja will never die
[1:04:13] <%BioHunter> @Sydin18 im watching ff14 while playing ff14
[1:04:14] <+mental_mashup> reaper sets comin outtttt
[1:04:21] <RaidenRising> nah i cant play this game with my actual iob  , too much
[1:04:21] <%bugz_munny> its the POTD for 71-80
[1:04:21] <%Monkeyweed21> why not soot black?
[1:04:22] <%Puhff> Oh THAT'S what Retainers are for
[1:04:30] <Soulsbjorne> hat ruins it
[1:04:30] <VirtuaRailith> that's really good
[1:04:31] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt so you are not coloring it the disgusting purple
[1:04:32] <Calamity2007> @kyrona2 As a AST healer main...yeah
[1:04:32] <Ultimatefool> Pat...was that water materia you're holding onto?
[1:04:38] <+projectmanatees> Stormblood maps are good to sell since there an event
[1:04:42] <%bevyrage> it matches the liner and lets it blend
[1:04:43] <AnnaBanana> I think like a month or 2 ago, 50% of the people were doing bozja LUL
[1:04:43] <Nordguy> why do you keep combat materia that isnt 7 or 8?
[1:04:55] <37calorieghost> i actually really like the slightly off-tone on the arms
[1:04:56] <%Dakuu75> does everyone in chat and discord pretty much go to this server?
[1:04:59] <ZimmiZ> oh good you're not a roegadyn anymore
[1:05:05] <TheGammaBear> Some of them you can use for Relic steps
[1:05:07] <+projectmanatees> @nordguy over melding
[1:05:07] <Calamity2007> @kyrona2 Being an AST is suffering. That is why I hope Sage turns out to be really
[1:05:12] <Calamity2007> @kyrona2 good
[1:05:20] <$Ziegsy> red to match coat?
[1:05:21] <%Mekhet09> Man. I really want to go back but it's so overwhelming.
[1:05:24] <ColRedyx> @Dakuu75 Yeah Pat's whole community is on Ultros.
[1:05:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> But you'll know it doesn't match @PatStaresAt
[1:05:29] <AsagiRyuu> ooh shiny sword
[1:05:39] <%pokefan9956> is pat being creative?
[1:05:39] <Sydin18> lets see that shoebill, feed him
[1:05:39] <%Mekhet09> The game has too much stuff imo.
[1:05:44] <doc_ock_rokc> ew
[1:05:45] <Parapattern> Looks like poop
[1:05:48] <$Ziegsy> you got dark red?
[1:05:50] <GilliamYaeger> You could say that you're ARMored.
[1:05:51] <+OnyxMemory> bozja is pain but its not as pain as eureka
[1:05:55] <%MisterRockett> Ooooo the DRK relic comes to a pointed tip at the last step? Cause I've always hated the flared tip.
[1:05:55] <Calamity2007> @Mekhet09 Frankly I think if it is overwhelming you should probably stick to the MSQ and a single job questline
[1:05:57] <SaphronBlackbourne> I think I was originally gonna play on Ultros cuz of Pat lol
[1:06:02] <%Monkeyweed21> it looks like you rubbed spicy poop on it
[1:06:02] <SaphronBlackbourne> Then I played on Faerie
[1:06:07] <%0rond> are you not going to play reaper/sage on launch?
[1:06:10] <+cascadepersona> AST is how I first learned there's an option to change the party order in the party list for controller use
[1:06:10] <%Toynota10> goddamn
[1:06:15] <Calamity2007> I like the story and lore in Bozja at least
[1:06:16] <%Nobrev> never make the metal the same color as the fabric
[1:06:17] <ZimmiZ> LUL
[1:06:17] <%bugz_munny> too dank
[1:06:18] <%Puhff> OH FUCK
[1:06:20] <doc_ock_rokc> Guilitine of Tyrants
[1:06:22] <AsagiRyuu> swole edge
[1:06:26] <renyerh> Hello pat, i hope that reaper is not locked in animation like DRG was but honestly my only hope for Endwalker is that MNK doesnt suck for a third time in a row...and if it does i guess i am edgyboy...seeing him play makes me want to play again...but i refuse based on principle alone...also nice glam.
[1:06:27] <Nupinoop296> big glowy
[1:06:30] <37calorieghost> thats a FAT swoird
[1:06:32] <%Dakuu75> @ColRedyx doodBro
[1:06:32] <nevan_44> THATS THE BEST PART
[1:06:34] <Calamity2007> Bozja also drops some cool mounts
[1:06:34] <%Puhff> What is that from?
[1:06:36] <$Ziegsy> whats the byako Sword?
[1:06:44] <+SuicidalLemmming> surprised your not using the baseball hat
[1:06:45] <GilliamYaeger> Much prefer Hyperconductive Nothung myself
[1:06:48] <DianaTheAscian> shame u can't dye the effects I think
[1:06:50] <Calamity2007> Since it is glowing blue wouldn't it be more the Soul Calibur?
[1:06:52] <%lucky_icarus> @patstaresat Have you ever fantasia just to change eye color or only race change?
[1:06:53] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[1:06:54] <37calorieghost> mnks pretty good rn
[1:06:54] <+Frranky> hahahaha
[1:06:57] <%AllenDeadman> crazy talk
[1:07:01] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:07:02] <%Deft_Thought> Madness
[1:07:05] <Daniel_Is_I> Goblins strike again
[1:07:08] <Calamity2007> @37calorieghost I'm considering that too
[1:07:10] <Sydin18> The true endgame as always
[1:07:11] <SaphronBlackbourne> I just accept clipping
[1:07:11] <%Nobrev> pat this WHOLE GAME is clipping
[1:07:14] <Reap14> Have you checked out the Byakko crafted weapon effects? Worthy glamour.
[1:07:16] <%Mekhet09> @Calamity2007 Yeah but then there's nothing to do. I just wish I could organize my priority list because there's alot of shit to do in the game.
[1:07:21] <%Monkeyweed21> MNK needs something to replace greased lightning
[1:07:22] <ZimmiZ> wait you can meld  it yourself????
[1:07:23] <cosmicgoatee> mmo design goblins are the Woooorst
[1:07:31] <TheGammaBear> You can use Water materia for the Heavensward relic
[1:07:31] <renyerh> Ehh MNK is pretty mediocre RN tobe fair, is catually the same that in 2.0
[1:07:41] <%Garthunox> you can turn it in for stuff for the HW relics
[1:07:45] <renyerh> actually*
[1:07:47] <%Frost_Quill> He can't come to the First Pat.
[1:07:49] <%JohnAtDawn> Your on the FIRST PAT
[1:07:50] <JeysJumbleJams> dress up time with pat
[1:07:51] <ZimmiZ> i didnt know you could meld gear yourself
[1:07:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> its because its on the First
[1:07:52] <Sydin18> Why would he be in the first? :^)
[1:07:55] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> There used to not be a glamor chest either
[1:07:56] <NeonBleu> how would he get there?
[1:07:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> you get soulbind bonus for fully melded gear and most gathering legs dont need full melds
[1:07:56] <+tetraes> @PatStaresAt  is this the real endgame fashion?
[1:07:56] <Daniel_Is_I> You can't summon JoJo Hairdresser to the First
[1:07:58] <+Frranky> beauty school on the First got ate by the Flood
[1:08:00] <%velemi> LUL
[1:08:02] <animaturgy> They should have let Fe Oul do it yeah
[1:08:02] <%JohnAtDawn> LUL
[1:08:03] <%Nobrev> he only lives on the source
[1:08:04] <@SSaryn> Just go to Limsa ez
[1:08:05] <+kyrona2> MNK can do good, but it's just awkward to play with the way things work currently
[1:08:06] <%Fidel_Castbro> big disagree as a Monk Main for the last 7 years I found the 5.4 adjustment quite refreshing
[1:08:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> do you really trust Feo Ul to do your make up?
[1:08:07] <%chance_h> lol fairy doing makeup
[1:08:08] <xeros720> yeah, you'd think the fairies would be good at it
[1:08:12] <+MayorRev> pat is this your house?
[1:08:12] <+OnyxMemory> thank god vit melding is gone
[1:08:13] <+gutlesscoward> the fairy's not as strong as jandelain
[1:08:13] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:08:13] <%Frost_Quill> Have the fairy do it but have a chance for the fairy to do it wrong as a joke sometimes.
[1:08:16] <+geistuser> imagine if it took 25 hours just glamour your character
[1:08:21] <CriticKitten> LUL
[1:08:21] <%chance_h> lol i love that
[1:08:24] <+gwanzan> is it more difficult to heal with controller than mouse and keyboard?
[1:08:26] <Sydin18> ....You really trust Feu to do ur hair?
[1:08:26] <@SpaceCapnCrone> "Property of Feo Ul" written across your face
[1:08:27] <Daniel_Is_I> @CreepyPorpoise I trust Feo with my life, why not my hair?
[1:08:28] <%AllenDeadman> that's usually how the fae kidnap children
[1:08:30] <doc_ock_rokc> -ANGRY SCOTTISH HAIRCUTS-
[1:08:39] <%Puhff> I hate that
[1:08:43] <%kainhighwind1990> I heard the aethestician is a Jojo reference?
[1:08:47] <+projectmanatees> Faires told tataru how to make the scions outfits
[1:08:49] <renyerh> @Fidel_Castbro I mean it plays literally the same, you just dont need PB as a starter, but is literally the same
[1:08:56] <@SSaryn> Or don't Kappa
[1:08:56] <+MayorRev> Is housing still bullshit in this game
[1:08:59] <%chance_h> Life is a jojo's reference
[1:08:59] <TheAntiNihilist> so I just got here. does this mean he will stream Endwalker?
[1:09:04] <Sydin18> nah, lets see them boxer shorts
[1:09:05] <AsagiRyuu> SWOLE PAT
[1:09:08] <%Garthunox> i use a black stripe across my eyes

[1:09:16] <37calorieghost> oh, hi redhead ilberd
[1:09:20] <@SSaryn> ok boomer.

[1:09:32] <doc_ock_rokc> Its a five head
[1:09:34] <37calorieghost> eyeshadow SLAPS in this game
[1:09:37] <Nupinoop296> almost all of the Highlander faces so look so weird
[1:09:38] <%Frost_Quill> Why are you just ginger Ilberd?
[1:09:38] <ZimmiZ> ughhh
[1:09:39] <%Deft_Thought> WHAT THE FUCK
[1:09:40] <+Grayhammatter> gigantic forhead
[1:09:42] <SaphronBlackbourne> I was goona use guyliner but i wanted freckles

[1:09:48] <@SSaryn> But you do
[1:09:48] <%Dakuu75> why does the face shape look so square and the nose is so flat
[1:09:49] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:09:49] <%Deft_Thought> That looks like something out of The Bouncer
[1:09:51] <TheGammaBear> That's a Chad haircut right there
[1:09:51] <%bugz_munny> BUT RP PAT
[1:09:53] <37calorieghost> ive never made a good looking character without eyeshadow
[1:09:53] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:09:53] <LorcaNomad> that's stupid
[1:09:55] <+Frranky> is this hyur only hair I've never seen it?
[1:09:55] <doggieo> Rude
[1:09:56] <ColRedyx> @gwanzan Only a little.  You have to scroll up and down your party list for single target heals, but you rarely heal single target and when you do it's usually the tank, who's at the top anyway.  Controller can also soft target which keyboard can't.  Soft targeting snaps you back to your previous target after the next cast.
[1:09:59] <%Deft_Thought> Where's your massive Dog Chain and zippers
[1:10:03] <%pokefan9956> >tribal garbage
[1:10:04] <+SuicidalLemmming> just use the bald
[1:10:06] <velozity> pat hates indigenous people
[1:10:08] <AnnaBanana> I saw someone from the brume with that hairstyle
[1:10:10] <%solracc25> oh no bald
[1:10:11] <xeros720> like real life

[1:10:46] <%AzureGale> oof
[1:10:47] <xeros720> to be fair, if you had that hair in real life, that kind of happens
[1:10:47] <TheFranss> Vergil haircut could also be option Kappa
[1:10:48] <+FluffyTails> Long hair is so tragic. It looks great but you have to have a body piece in mind that works with it
[1:10:49] <LorcaNomad> ew that's a big f
[1:10:50] <Lefanque> least the haircut you wanr doesn't coast 10mil gil

[1:10:53] <+Grayhammatter> oh noooooooo
[1:10:54] <orbulon> I just use a man bun to avoid shitty clipping
[1:10:55] <%spitelite> boo
[1:10:56] <37calorieghost> long hair in this game lmao
[1:10:57] <animaturgy> The Au ra ponytail haircut is like that too
[1:10:59] <%RetroCop87> hair should have a mechanic where it cuts off when it clips
[1:11:00] <%thedankestmeeme> you'll be like captain jack sparrow
[1:11:03] <JeysJumbleJams> i have a female character so the mullet doesn't clip with my armor as bad
[1:11:03] <Nupinoop296> Yotsuyu Pat

[1:11:06] <%Deft_Thought> Are there any Black/Afro hair styles in the game? I know there aren't but I always gotta ask
[1:11:07] <SaphronBlackbourne> I love my pomp, I feel like my guy is nearly the only one who can pull it off
[1:11:07] <Psyramics> Patron-hime

[1:11:13] <Parapattern> Gotta have that popped collar
[1:11:13] <+Grayhammatter> yotsupat
[1:11:14] <nevan_44> HIME CUT GO
[1:11:17] <Uselesswhitenoise> they should invent future technology that makes hair and clothing work like real life
[1:11:21] <ZimmiZ> @PatStaresAt I bought the thancred hair with the rat-tail, and I learned about how bad it clipped
[1:11:23] <%SeleneDemorigan> im at the point I dont care about clipping,
[1:11:24] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I do the top pony-tails clip through the hat?
[1:11:24] <@SSaryn> Hey man, mods exist for a reason.
[1:11:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Hair textures are ROUGH.

[1:12:52] <doc_ock_rokc> I hate fades
[1:12:52] <%chance_h> cornrow
[1:13:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> More like a cornrow.

[1:13:03] <%Reveresao> a fade LUL
[1:13:04] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt It's cornrows/braids
[1:13:04] <Zeif00> side roes
[1:13:05] <%NitronStreams> pretty sure those are cornrows
[1:13:09] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> Pat - "Is that a fade?"
[1:13:10] <+gwanzan> "I was talking shit about the healer and I ended up with this scar."
[1:13:12] <%AllenDeadman> oh no
[1:13:12] <CruxAustralis> wait are you making a new character?
[1:13:13] <%kysath> Waering the Pompadour screams to me that you wanted to make a "wacky silly character" and you'' drop the game before even getting to the first dungeon.
[1:13:15] <%Dakuu75> yes?
[1:13:19] <@SSaryn> I mean, probably.
[1:13:19] <CruxAustralis> oh wait it's the hair stylist

Just started FFXIV a few months back to (eventually) play with level-capped friends. Are NPC Adventurer Squadrons the coward's way out of avoiding random ques until then, or are the ques just more-or-less unavoidable?

[1:17:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> Chichen in Elmig had a better one
[1:17:33] <37calorieghost> about 3ft too short

[1:19:42] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Are muffins cakes?

[1:19:46] <+deejay782> does pvp do suck
[1:19:47] <+SuicidalLemmming> got 6months to relic grind anyways
[1:19:50] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I hope they are also increasing the odds in Bozja
[1:19:51] <+FluffyTails> 15 crystal tower sounded like suicide
[1:19:51] <+brandonsbetow> Rival wings is probably up
[1:19:52] <ZimmiZ> @PatStaresAt do you think they
[1:19:53] <%Divryne> Do savage you coward.
[1:19:53] <maddogshimano> pvp right now
[1:19:55] <TheFranss> wasnt the stat squish done, cause BIG number can cause BUG
[1:19:56] <ZimmiZ> goddamit
[1:19:59] <Sydin18> I think pvp is a mixed bag
[1:20:00] <maddogshimano> do rival wings
[1:20:02] <Psyramics> @GrandmasterBFunk that's already been nerfed, you can get them in 3 CLLs
[1:20:11] <%MisterRockett> I'm STILL running to that!
[1:20:12] <Nordguy> :c
[1:20:14] <%MisterRockett> TELL ME PLEAE
[1:20:16] <%NateyBeak> @PatStaresAt will they ever do chemist/that item guy from tactics as a class?
[1:20:22] <%chance_h> Bill gates is a Xbox player
[1:20:27] <+cascadepersona> I use DS4 windows and a PS5 controller connected wirelessly.
[1:20:29] <Veserados> Windows bluetooth sucks
[1:20:30] <%DMJohndrow> @deejay782 Is the bozja stuff hard to get into now?
[1:20:34] <ZimmiZ> @PatStaresAt  do you think they will give tanks a parry ?
[1:20:37] <EndCrawler> Did you do the nier quest this week ?
[1:20:46] <NeonBleu> DS4 windows looks to stop it for me so far
[1:20:50] <%0rond> why is your BLU at 70? in the road to shb you were so proud of it being not unlocked?
[1:20:56] <%shurtal> Should i hold off on upgrading my belt, since it's going away?
[1:20:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat Aside from Dark Knight, which other class is your favorite class quests?
[1:21:03] <%AllenDeadman> lmao
[1:21:06] <callingarcia> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about a loooot of wow players coming over for the next expansion? I hear shadowlands is baaaad.
[1:21:07] <%AllenDeadman> "it didn't work"
[1:21:19] <%Deft_Thought> Blue Mage seems forgotten in this game
[1:21:23] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[1:21:27] <LorcaNomad> LUL
[1:21:33] <+brandonsbetow> damn
[1:21:34] <callingarcia> @PatStaresAt I guess you are right about that
[1:21:35] <Finaldragoon> gotem
[1:21:37] <HollowBeansVG> wow refuge
[1:21:38] <%chance_h> turns out that the wow killer was WoW itself
[1:21:39] <%bevyrage> yeah every wow expansion brings in a new wave of players
[1:21:40] <Kain5707> Asmon LUL
[1:21:41] <+BIumen> that guy
[1:21:43] <JeysJumbleJams> i left wow literally this year lmao
[1:21:44] <%Valdorick> Yeah fuck fuck Asmongold
[1:21:44] <FortuneEX> I am one of those WoW players. Just full on stopping WoW
[1:21:46] <%watchmanfury> @PatStaresAt Is it worth it to get into stormblood when I was really satisfied with how Heavensward ended?
[1:21:47] <StaticEntry> "That one guy"
[1:21:47] <ZimmiZ> that 1 guy LUL
[1:21:50] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm kind of a WoW defect? I stopped playing WoW and refused to try MMOs for awhile tho
[1:21:52] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:21:52] <DianaTheAscian> one guy?
[1:21:56] <%Valdorick> I'm playing both
[1:22:01] <VirtuaRailith> WoW gets bad
[1:22:01] <%furiousfurioso> Jesse Cox is a huge FF14 fan now coming from WoW
[1:22:04] <kerazykitsune> Have you already recieved the Hair and mount from DR?
[1:22:07] <callingarcia> Asmon literally heard the full trailer song and said it sucked, I don't understand that man
[1:22:07] <VidulaSaix> Yall do realize Asmon plays that shit up for clicks right. He knows the game is good, just not for him LUL
[1:22:08] <Sol_Install> ah gold of course he'll dod that
[1:22:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Jesse Cox has been doing great switching to this
[1:22:12] <SaphronBlackbourne> But when I played XIV I was like "holy shit this is way better than WoW could ever hope to be"
[1:22:13] <%0rond> can you not augment cryptlurker accessories or are you just cool with them on 520?
[1:22:15] <%Frost_Quill> I loved WoW when I was a kid.  I was also terrible at mmos.  It's a shame to see it getting that bad.
[1:22:16] <%spitelite> only problem is when a tank tries to kite
[1:22:18] <ZimmiZ> that one guy that said FFXIV wasnt flashy enough LUL LUL LUL
[1:22:22] <%Valdorick> A good guild in WoW can keep you in it. Take it from me.
[1:22:23] <Jail_House_Lock> whats the fastest way to cap different jobs? it looks like a royal pain in the ass but still want to do it
[1:22:31] <Yummy_Nukes> That day... if our plates were switched... Would our arteries be different? Would I have your bypass, and you mine? Let's eat this, Dante...
[1:22:34] <Revzero25> lazy peon?
[1:22:36] <Kain5707> Monkeyweed21 hes a huge 14 nerd now its amazing how much lore he knows already
[1:22:39] <ColRedyx> The hard part is just getting people past ARR.
[1:22:39] <Daniel_Is_I> It pushed me away!
[1:22:41] <Sheveniner> The biggest difference between the games can be seen in how their respective fanfests were run.
[1:22:44] <VirtuaRailith> I think ff14 is pretty good, but it's not what I want out of a MMO
[1:22:45] <StaticEntry> 17 years Pat
[1:22:45] <LorcaNomad> That must physically hurt
[1:22:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> Bozja when you get to 70 and trusts
[1:22:53] <ZimmiZ> potd
[1:22:53] <%AllenDeadman> pog
[1:22:54] <Kougaon1> FFXIV doesn't offer offer what WoW does and vice versa, they are games for different audiences.
[1:22:59] <+MayorRev> 14 years, 14 fantasies
[1:23:01] <%chance_h> The hottest wow thing i was a private server that gives you randomly rolled abilities as you level
[1:23:01] <+MayorRev> ayyy
[1:23:06] <VidulaSaix> Trusts are super not a fast way to level LUL
[1:23:07] <TheFranss> Now Im getting flashbacks to ARR filler quests. Hope new guys coming don't tire out
[1:23:07] <%Monkeyweed21> yea other expansion is the worst expansion WoW has ever had
[1:23:08] <Nupinoop296> big roulettes and 60+ beast tribes
[1:23:09] <%0rond> what to do when you're capped on poetic and don't need any tome gear?
[1:23:22] <+BIumen> that vista
[1:23:24] <Kain5707> just do MSQ
[1:23:28] <%Reveresao> I am level 12 NotLikeThis
[1:23:28] <%Monkeyweed21> every other*
[1:23:32] <+thetruewaifu> what are those glowing orbs like that one you just passed
[1:23:37] <+deejay782> you buy tome gear and turn it in for seals
[1:23:37] <DianaTheAscian> ah yes 60 the wort level in the game
[1:23:38] <Nupinoop296> YEEAAAAAAH
[1:23:42] <Nupinoop296> i love the Ananta
[1:23:50] <JeysJumbleJams> i played wow since i was 12, i never dungeoned and just got tired of doing quests and feel off, got back in for a bit then dropped it when all my friends started talking about ff14 and it's definitely way more compelling storywise
[1:23:53] <SaphronBlackbourne> ...I still can't fly in any Stormblood zone lol
[1:23:55] <%Frost_Quill> And pray you get Prae.
[1:23:59] <%Nobrev> PRAY FOR PRAE
[1:24:04] <ZimmiZ> PVP is real good
[1:24:05] <ColRedyx> @0rond Find the grade 3 shroud/thanalan soil sold at the tome vendors in Idyllshire and buy those to sell on the market board.
[1:24:07] <%cvp5127> what happens when you get to lvl 60 on the free trial
[1:24:11] <%CalderGaming> ananta are cool, their quests aren't the most convenient
[1:24:12] <%Frost_Quill> Heaven on High.
[1:24:14] <karovus> im suffering through prae right now to level my dnc lol
[1:24:16] <%Frost_Quill> Oh no.
[1:24:20] <EndCrawler> daily hunts give good exp too
[1:24:22] <%Frost_Quill> I was wrong.
[1:24:25] <%BoxNavy> GET YOUR AETHER CURRENTS PEOPLE
[1:24:29] <%Daxalog> When do you unlock duty finder?
[1:24:30] <HollowBeansVG> is suffer
[1:24:30] <%CalderGaming> @cvp5127 then you stop earning xp
[1:24:31] <%JohnAtDawn> Sigh is there really nothing better?

[1:24:52] <%CalderGaming> PACE YOURSELF
[1:24:57] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[1:24:59] <%JohnAtDawn> ROAD TO 70 ALL DAY EVERY DAY
[1:25:03] <VidulaSaix> I feel like you're overcomplicating this a bit cause the roulettes alone will get you from 60-62 LUL
[1:25:05] <Gates623> Just do dailies
[1:25:07] <%Frost_Quill> Wait WHAT
[1:25:08] <+deejay782> also make sure to eat food for exp buff
[1:25:12] <%Agami23> just dont get to level 80 in heavensward. like some people.
[1:25:12] <%Frost_Quill> Oh.
[1:25:19] <DianaTheAscian> YOU WILL DIE IF YOU KEEP GOING AND GOING
[1:25:23] <%AllenDeadman> so he went up a whole 2 levels
[1:25:23] <%BoxNavy> or just do what i do and run deep dungeons until you die :)
[1:25:31] <%shurtal> ALSO EAT YOUR FOOD
[1:25:32] <%Frost_Quill> Oh I thought you meant you got more exp in general depending on even or odd lol.
[1:25:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PREORDER ENDWALKER FOR THE EARRING, IT'S A 30% EXP BOOST
[1:25:35] <Jail_House_Lock> ohhh I see!
[1:25:36] <+Angrec> @PatStaresAt What is your suggestion for leveling reaper?
[1:25:46] <ZimmiZ> you can get 2-2.5 levels from all your roulettes
[1:25:53] <DianaTheAscian> msqq gives like 40% or something
[1:26:00] <%0rond> @Angrec give up lol
[1:26:03] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt if its there first job MSQ should be enough exp to get to max
[1:26:06] <%JohnAtDawn> @Angrec It starts at 70, use roulettes to 71 then Bozjah
[1:26:15] <+scynza> Any advice for someone about to start leveling healer on a controller? I've leveled all the dps and tanks to 60, and I'm about to start healing and I'm kind of intimidated.
[1:26:17] <callingarcia> Just wait for the level squish Kappa
[1:26:20] <+deejay782> also preorder endwalker for exp earring
[1:26:21] <%JohnAtDawn> YEAH BOZJAH
[1:26:27] <%Mekhet09> It starts at like 70 so it's such a joke leveling it o max.

[1:28:01] <%velemi> just buy mineral water from the vendor
[1:28:02] <NeonBleu> but i like my eggs
[1:28:04] <ZimmiZ> @jackythefrost roulettes are still faster. Bozja is like 2 hours per level
[1:28:05] <HollowBeansVG> I prefer boiled eggs personally, got thousands of those bitches
[1:28:05] <TioXyco> there's also Mineral Water. it's even cheaper than juice
[1:28:06] <+MayorRev> ARNJ
[1:28:07] <+kyrona2> I take the orange juice and I eat it
[1:28:10] <Uselesswhitenoise> so much vitamin c...

[1:28:13] <Kain5707> 3
[1:28:14] <neptious> Boiled Eggs team
[1:28:14] <+MayorRev> it's pronounced arnj joose
[1:28:19] <ColRedyx> @Sheveniner It works if you do a leveling roulette that syncs you to 1-30 though
[1:28:21] <Sydin18> What about the 4% meals? C;
[1:28:22] <%BoxNavy> so you can solo bozja and be fine?
[1:28:23] <%Valdorick> What if they don't thoough!?

[1:28:39] <%Reveresao> @PatStaresAt Where do find rotations?
[1:28:39] <faldin> BIG exp
[1:28:42] <%Mekhet09> If only the preorder bonus was a ring. That should have stacked with the ring.
[1:28:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> the best part of not playing this game is hearing a lot of words out of context

[1:29:18] <%Arkfyre> read your skills and praxtice on a dummy
[1:29:22] <Blank9> When should I level another class? I just started Gladiator, up to level 20.
[1:29:23] <+brandonsbetow> nice bozjan clusters
[1:29:25] <2DSuperiority> internet is where you find
[1:29:27] <Defm551> best class for beginners? the only mmo i play a ton of is SWTOR
[1:29:27] <CriticKitten> @JohnAtDawn You have to enter your Steam pre-order code into MogStation, have you done that yet?
[1:29:31] <%Nobrev> The Balance discord server has many informations
[1:29:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'm in Elmig on Primal, and join Knights of Chocolina in Siren on Aether, we all sick
[1:29:36] <+cascadepersona> @patstaresat Pat, how difficult is Savage content compared to Extreme content?
[1:29:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> *suck
[1:29:44] <Covil91> Red Mage
[1:29:46] <Nupinoop296> dragoon
[1:29:46] <ColRedyx> They also have their job guides listed at thebalanceffxiv
[1:29:48] <ZimmiZ> bard
[1:29:50] <+pandamancer224> RDM is REALLY easy
[1:29:51] <%jackythefrost> @ZimmiZ wat, Im leveling RDM rn and got 4 levels in an hour and a half spamming fates as fast as possible
[1:29:52] <%Frost_Quill> Arcanist if you don't wanna be a tank.
[1:29:52] <neptious> LANCER
[1:29:56] <orbulon> rdm
[1:29:56] <%Monkeyweed21> SMN
[1:29:56] <+Ben_Ben817> @patstaresat Is there a fast way to make gil besides crafting?
[1:29:59] <faldin> castrum pops all the time now
[1:30:00] <%0rond> RDM is pretty easy but you only unlock it on 50
[1:30:02] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt do they show u like a flow chart or something?
[1:30:04] <Daniel_Is_I> @pandamancer224 You can't start as RDM though
[1:30:07] <IminyourBase> best classes are your pure classes, pure tanks, pure DPS or pure healers then go hyrbrids
[1:30:10] <%Agami23> my brother beat E4S last week. that shits nuts
[1:30:11] <Uselesswhitenoise> whats the worse class for beginners, if i want to punish myself
[1:30:14] <ColRedyx> @cascadepersona It's the same step up as normal 8-mans to extremes.
[1:30:19] <+OnyxMemory> after savage you start doing ultimates
[1:30:23] <JeysJumbleJams> i'm new and want to be paladin, is this a mistake?
[1:30:25] <neptious> Lancer easy
[1:30:25] <DianaTheAscian> e10s was pretty brutal
[1:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> MNK
[1:30:27] <ZimmiZ> @jackythefrost ü§î
[1:30:28] <+thetruewaifu> warrior
[1:30:32] <callingarcia> DRAGOOON
[1:30:32] <+blastazoid00> Lancer
[1:30:33] <+MayorRev> I'm pretty interested in Machinist, are they fun?
[1:30:34] <%kainhighwind1990> bard
[1:30:35] <+cascadepersona> @colredyx Ah, I see. Thank you.
[1:30:36] <EndCrawler> Have you done the nier quest for the week ?
[1:30:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @JeysJumbleJams not at all
[1:30:37] <ZimmiZ> bard
[1:30:38] <ogpurpledaddy> bard :)
[1:30:39] <callingarcia> dragoon is easy af
[1:30:39] <ColRedyx> The best class is whatever will keep you interested in playing.
[1:30:42] <LordDudeTheFirst> DNC makes my brain feel smooth
[1:30:44] <bigdrifter> PLD
[1:30:46] <SaphronBlackbourne> I began as BLM oof
[1:30:48] <+deejay782> i would say bard or black mage
[1:30:49] <%Agami23> dragoon, warrior, white mage
[1:30:50] <JeysJumbleJams> @Monkeyweed21 ok cool
[1:30:51] <+kyrona2> If EX is a 4 Floors 1-2 are a 6, 3-4 are a 7
[1:30:52] <%JoshManVGH> @mayorrev MCH is a blast!
[1:30:56] <xeros720> hmm
[1:30:56] <neptious> Not BLM
[1:30:58] <%Mekhet09> White mage.
[1:30:59] <Revzero25> is MCH good?
[1:31:00] <DianaTheAscian> arcanist
[1:31:00] <maddogshimano> beginner class honestly feels like dance/drk/sam
[1:31:00] <ergheisu> Warrior takes the least brain power, only hard part is tank mechanics
[1:31:01] <IminyourBase> dragoon
[1:31:03] <Bathezid> i began as BLM, went through the whole msq with it :)
[1:31:04] <IminyourBase> bard
[1:31:04] <+cascadepersona> Dragoon
[1:31:07] <%BoxNavy> @mayorrev high APM but very few buttons. theyre really fun
[1:31:09] <neptious> Lancer is the most refreshing as an MMO
[1:31:09] <Daniel_Is_I> DRG is braindead until like 60
[1:31:10] <Gates623> Bard is easy
[1:31:12] <IminyourBase> paladin is easiest tank
[1:31:16] <DianaTheAscian> @Revzero25 very
[1:31:17] <Gates623> Learn dots
[1:31:17] <Tracazoid> White Mage is pretty easy-ish although you'll die inside like most healers
[1:31:19] <@commanderclaw> MNK made my brain melt
[1:31:19] <IminyourBase> white mage is easiest healer
[1:31:21] <%0rond> I was MNK until 50, than RDM from than onward
[1:31:21] <ergheisu> IMPULSE DRIVE
[1:31:21] <TheGammaBear> Black mage is super simple up to 50, then switch to Red Mage
[1:31:23] <mimi777> did u see the big WoW creator moved to FFXIV? @PatStaresAt
[1:31:28] <callingarcia> Dragoon made me love the game
[1:31:28] <%Nobrev> my first class was marauder so I was a warrior until I switched to red mage in stormblood
[1:31:32] <2DSuperiority> Black Mage changes every level it's crazy
[1:31:34] <+jinshiroi> Warior go brrr
[1:31:36] <ZimmiZ> LUL

[1:31:47] <%walternatorz> uhhhhh

[1:32:02] <xeros720> yeah, whm is good, regen and heals make it easy, but you gotta be ready to follow people as they run off in dungeons
[1:32:07] <IminyourBase> JUST SPAM OVERPOWER
[1:32:07] <%Grubrot> yeah I really hope it gets more next expac
[1:32:09] <+brandonsbetow> Smooth brain warrior!
[1:32:10] <%Valdorick> Rotation? You mean Fell cleave into fell cleave?
[1:32:11] <MoonKing> the ungest of bungest WAR STRONG
[1:32:12] <DianaTheAscian> WAR IS UNGA BUNGA
[1:32:13] <maddogshimano> warrior/drk are very good beginner tanks
[1:32:17] <+jinshiroi> fell cleave 7 times is the opener
[1:32:19] <ZimmiZ> I will never main a class with cone AOEs
[1:32:20] <JeysJumbleJams> oh hell yeah big damage
[1:32:22] <%Mekhet09> Where the hell are you releases?
[1:32:23] <TioXyco> WAR is very simples, but it's SO SATISFYING
[1:32:27] <+MayorRev> I remember seeing an ability where you could summon a giant robot, was that for machinist?
[1:32:32] <+Ben_Ben817> holmgang gang!
[1:32:38] <%Mekhet09> Yes.
[1:32:39] <Defm551> how hard would this game be to get into coming from star wars the old republic
[1:32:40] <xeros720> yeah, late machinist
[1:32:42] <soprodiamonds> could u show Dancer ABILITIES I JUST GOT SHADOW BRINGER :)
[1:32:45] <Covil91> Infuriate once for CDR
[1:32:48] <+MayorRev> oooooh
[1:32:48] <@SpaceCapnCrone> you trying to do 10 Fell Cleaves in a row?
[1:32:50] <%BoxNavy> @mayorrev yee
[1:32:52] <%Grubrot> I think you wanna infuriate earlier so you dont overcap
[1:32:52] <neptious> Hit the unga then the bunga
[1:32:55] <%Frost_Quill> @MayorRev That is machinist yes.
[1:32:57] <maddogshimano> no its chaos then IR
[1:32:58] <MoonKing> one infuritae before inner release
[1:32:58] <%JoshManVGH> "If you want to Fell Cleave AGain and AGain and Again and Again!" JoCat 2021
[1:32:59] <scientiafidem> Is it? Still a tank rotation, they are pretty straightforward.
[1:33:02] <+brandonsbetow> use your inner release first
[1:33:04] <+brandonsbetow> yes
[1:33:05] <+jinshiroi> tomahawk, infuriate, storm eye combo, fell cleave, inner relase, fell cleave x5
[1:33:16] <maddogshimano> its infuriate then you hit inner relase
[1:33:17] <ColRedyx> Storm's Eye combo, Infuriate > Inner Chaos x2, Inner Release, FC spam + Upheaval and Onslaught
[1:33:18] <EL_TRO> whens TeA progg
[1:33:19] <Covil91> ^
[1:33:22] <SaphronBlackbourne> My first tank class was DRK
[1:33:23] <%Deft_Thought> Is Warrior a DPS or a TANK class?
[1:33:24] <TioXyco> Infuriate > inner Chaos > inner release > cleave x5 > infuriate > chaos
[1:33:26] <callingarcia> The only hard part about getting into the game is finishing the main story for A realm reborn, after that you won't be stopping
[1:33:35] <%Mekhet09> YEAH YEAH YEAH.
[1:33:39] <%Kaask> what the fuck
[1:33:40] <%Deft_Thought> Dang, get up in there!
[1:33:42] <JeysJumbleJams> YEAH
[1:33:43] <%BestTeaMaker> brrr
[1:33:47] <+hush_wolf> the fuck is that even?
[1:33:47] <Blank9> warrior is tank
[1:33:48] <%Mekhet09> It's fun.
[1:33:48] <ColRedyx> Technically you do the first Infuriate right at pull to start the charge cooldown, you just don't spend it until you apply Storm's Eye.
[1:33:48] <Finaldragoon> UNGA
[1:33:49] <%solracc25> psaBig number
[1:33:50] <+Kenidashi> mash that cleave button

[1:33:54] <%Dakuu75> omg, does the XIV program launcher have a dark-mode? (my eyes!)
[1:33:57] <+cascadepersona> What's your opinions on Gunbreaker?
[1:33:57] <+kyrona2> @PatStaresAt Can we talk about the stormblood part of the Endwalker
[1:33:57] <+thetruewaifu> the only tank
[1:34:00] <Nordguy> ya missed the last one :(
[1:34:00] <IminyourBase> lol why do that when you can just spam overpower?
[1:34:00] <%Rumbutt> I wish the Bloodspiller animation was as cool as fell cleave
[1:34:02] <Sydin18> Not now baby, MOMMY'S FEL CLEAVING

[1:34:34] <JeysJumbleJams> i want to be big and strong for the boyz
[1:34:34] <televisedrevolting> What do "mental shenanigans" entail?
[1:34:37] <%0rond> tanking is easier than DPS out of savage/extreme content
[1:34:44] <andrewoid_> i really like the cross bar just for IR
[1:34:45] <%MugenSandan> Okay but what if I want to cosplay as a DPS
[1:34:45] <@SpaceCapnCrone> she is busy right now
[1:34:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> dont forget you can continue to walk forward for a few seconds and it will let you clip through furniture
[1:34:47] <+brandonsbetow> best dungeon tank when you get nascent glint
[1:34:50] <%BoxNavy> i cannot tank even though i know its fundamentally easy
[1:34:54] <+Catoclystic> Just finished the aesthetician quest, yeah that's a JoJo alright
[1:34:56] <soprodiamonds> could u show me dancer skills  i just got shadowbringer
[1:34:59] <@SpaceCapnCrone> go for it
[1:35:03] <+CookieCutter007> :)
[1:35:05] <ColRedyx> @0rond Even in savage, tanking is WAY easier.  it's the easiest role by far.
[1:35:13] <%BoxNavy> porpo...
[1:35:17] <%shurtal> @televisedrevolting Performance anxiety, being responsible for making sure all agro stays on you
[1:35:19] <Defm551> ok cool, i just signed up for the ps5 free trial to lvl 60

[1:35:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Meanwhile the ELMIG house is a fucking nightmare. Thanks Moth.
[1:35:39] <%Agami23> she is great. made me feel better about being a coward in resident evil because she also screams and cries
[1:35:39] <scientiafidem> Mental shenanigans? Tanking is the most straightforward role in the game. You hit dudes at melee range and have a more straightforward rotation then DPS.
[1:35:41] <%Dakuu75> "this one" has she done others?
[1:35:41] <LorcaNomad> oooh
[1:35:41] <nocustardbruv> how did you make a lot of gil?

[1:37:31] <%nosubstancex> Ah that looks great. I was always interested in seeing that FC
[1:37:31] <%JoshManVGH> That's a pretty good sacrifice tho
[1:37:34] <@CreepyPorpoise> Made it all ourselves, well, other than I guess the many thousands I've spent on the stupid partitions from the vendor
[1:37:39] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt How are you hiding the UI with controller?  I have to use keyboard.
[1:37:40] <%BestTeaMaker> pft
[1:37:50] <%Dakuu75> auto-sort?
[1:37:51] <neptious> Mine is like 10 items
[1:37:59] <%Agami23> well guys, if you want porpoise to know she did a good job, you should go and sub and donate to her channel psaSmug
[1:38:07] <%Frost_Quill> I've been playing this for over two years...
[1:38:07] <%CalderGaming> scroll lock on keyboard by default
[1:38:08] <TioXyco> oh, L1 and touchpad on PS4
[1:38:08] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Have you heard of dyanmic hotbars?
[1:38:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> @Agami23 creepy49Porpchamp
[1:38:10] <nocustardbruv> how did you make a lot of gil?
[1:38:13] <%Valdorick> I mean, you only have 2 tabs in your bags... so that's pretty clean compared to my 3.5
[1:38:13] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp Sweet, was wondering about that.
[1:38:13] <IminyourBase> why controller when keyboards exist?
[1:38:18] <%shurtal> My inventory is mostly food that iv'e been slowly eating my way through
[1:38:22] <+brandonsbetow> thats not clean
[1:38:23] <%AzureGale> what is this lb button you speak of, i'm playing on ps4
[1:38:25] <Covil91> Wait there's a controller shortcut? I've been using a macro LUL
[1:38:25] <DianaTheAscian> or L1 and the touch pad if on ps4
[1:38:27] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> no custom shaders?
[1:38:31] <%BoxNavy> :)

[1:38:46] <+yukichocomilk> :)
[1:38:46] <+informedotaku> gonna resub when the PS5 update is out of beta on the 25th.
[1:38:47] <Siconia> No mods here
[1:38:49] <%Mekhet09> Do you have your own house pat or was the bullshit too much for you to take?
[1:38:50] <neptious> Dynamic Hotbars for super fast class switching

[1:38:58] <%Takreth> act, I've stubbed my toe :)
[1:39:00] <afronooch> im thinking about switching to PC now that I have one capable of gaming, and man do i not wanna rebuy everything
[1:39:00] <%Agami23> spikey teeth mod for au ra.
[1:39:02] <FortuneEX> LUL

[1:39:08] <%AzureGale> But I like potatoes
[1:39:08] <%NitronStreams> GIVE
[1:39:08] <%BoxNavy> ;)
[1:39:09] <Tracazoid> LUL That's great
[1:39:09] <%JoshManVGH> What does it make them look like?
[1:39:09] <%CalderGaming> SHOW PARSER YOU FILTHY TRYHARD Kappa
[1:39:09] <%Rumbutt> The big lalafell mod is also hilarious
[1:39:09] <%Agami23> theres a mod that turns the lunar whale into the halo gunship
[1:39:10] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:39:11] <ColRedyx> @IminyourBase Controller gives you even more buttons on demand than keyboard, with the way the trigger system works, and it's way more comfortable long term.  Raiding in WoW was giving me RSI, not an issue in 14 on controller.
[1:39:11] <Sol_Install> no more potatos
[1:39:11] <Zebylth> giant lala fell mod is better
[1:39:12] <doc_ock_rokc> Im glad you are no longer have that ugly purple eveywhere
[1:39:12] <%0rond> there's one that replaces lalafells with actual potato models
[1:39:13] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:39:14] <%Frost_Quill> That was real?  I thought it was a joke.
[1:39:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But...Tataru and Pipin....
[1:39:16] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> oh yeah, I don't ever use them Kappa

[1:39:19] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:39:21] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Have you heard of Dynamic Hotbars? I use them and its amazing for PC
[1:39:21] <TheFranss> PAT DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO
[1:39:22] <Tracazoid> Is there a mod that turns them into potatoes?
[1:39:25] <karovus> time to break the rules
[1:39:26] <Uselesswhitenoise> "remove ______" is always a funny phrase
[1:39:27] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt there's a lalafell mod that changes them to the Among Us Bean LUL
[1:39:28] <%BoxNavy> theres an among us lalafell mod
[1:39:30] <Sydin18> Doesnt the mod replace the lalafell with a present?
[1:39:31] <ColRedyx> Job Icons is a good one.
[1:39:32] <%Agami23> have you seen human sized lalafells?
[1:39:34] <%AzureGale> @Agami23 Okay, that sounds rad
[1:39:34] <scientiafidem> That sounds like an ideal version of the game.
[1:39:35] <TheFranss> damn..
[1:39:35] <%Monkeyweed21> INEXPLICABLY POTATO OBSESSED
[1:39:35] <doc_ock_rokc> Is Pat Mad because Small?
[1:39:40] <+informedotaku> gonna stick with PC or move over to PS5? @patstaresat
[1:39:44] <+brandonsbetow> I would replace lalafell with mr face mod
[1:39:45] <maddogshimano> but i want a potato purge
[1:39:47] <SaphronBlackbourne> Too late I modded the game during my trial even
[1:39:49] <Daniel_Is_I> You won't get banned unless you talk about it
[1:39:51] <mihokspawn> @Uselesswhitenoise suddenly kebab
[1:39:51] <%Dakuu75> @Uselesswhitenoise "Remove Morals"
[1:39:52] <%Valdorick> Are Damage meters okay?
[1:39:54] <%BoxNavy> i would never install the hrothgar and viera hat mod
[1:39:54] <SaphronBlackbourne> And have GShade
[1:39:55] <%Frost_Quill> There's a cool mod that turns the summoner egis into mini versions of the primals like for real.  Obviously don't use mods...but it's cool.
[1:39:55] <%deejay782> deejay782 subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:40:05] <IminyourBase> you can sell gold in FF14, but don't mention you have mods for QoL LUL
[1:40:11] <+informedotaku> fair enough
[1:40:14] <+tundraSB> PS5 IT IS
[1:40:14] <%albobomb> they dont pay our sub, but they own our accounts so shit that argument is out the window
[1:40:14] <hakumaribo> didnt Yoshi P say he was ok with reshaders though?
[1:40:15] <Daniel_Is_I> Mods are in the same boat as damage meters. Don't ask, don't tell.
[1:40:16] <+FingaLights> Fucky wucky banny wanny
[1:40:16] <%velemi> yeah but what's your fps in limsa
[1:40:20] <%JoshManVGH> Come down to our level son!

[1:40:34] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I heard the ps5 version is fucky
[1:40:35] <Purpleleven> Didn't minor graphics mods and gshade and stuff actually get okayed by SQ awhile ago?
[1:40:36] <+kyrona2> Pat are you still on Primal?  I'm actually so excited to potentially world visit sometime once the DC hopping gets added.
[1:40:42] <neptious> How annoying is the venture jingle tho
[1:40:54] <+Princ3Mush> @PatStaresAt How the FUCK did porpoise get a large shirogane house
[1:40:56] <%BoxNavy> :)

[1:41:03] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt You think there'll ever be a Chrono raid set?
[1:41:06] <animaturgy> Any thoughts on how Reaper is going to work?
[1:41:06] <+BigChiefBear> made my game more colorful and noice
[1:41:07] <+Deosier> how long would it take to get a full set of 530 tome gear starting this week?
[1:41:07] <fritz_dacat> Hows the card game
[1:41:12] <$Faustgesicht> Luck
[1:41:16] <%shurtal> should i bother with upgrading my belt, now that their fucking off in the next expac?
[1:41:17] <@CreepyPorpoise> @Princ3Mush Its the FC house, and we got luckyh
[1:41:18] <%JohnAtDawn> ...what?
[1:41:20] <@SpaceCapnCrone> yes
[1:41:25] <%Valdorick> How to make money?
[1:41:25] <+Angrec> @PatStaresAt Have you looked at the lyrics (specially the translated dragon speak) for the endwalker theme yet? What's your take on it?
[1:41:25] <Blank9> When should I start leveling other jobs? I feel like if I wait too long, I won't be able to do MSQs at level 1.
[1:41:25] <DianaTheAscian> Luck
[1:41:25] <IminyourBase> oh yeah i remember the housing shortage. is that still a thing?
[1:41:25] <Revzero25> @PatStaresAt How do I get that Balthier glam?
[1:41:27] <+Vijuani> You gotta bribe GMs Kappa

[1:41:47] <%Mekhet09> Auto clicker.
[1:41:47] <+Princ3Mush> @Princ3Mush been trying to buy for a bit, cant get lucky :(
[1:41:47] <animaturgy> no life it
[1:41:47] <Daniel_Is_I> The secret is give everyone a bunch of money and have them all try to buy one
[1:41:48] <%Dakuu75> you have to whore yourself out
[1:41:50] <DianaTheAscian> is it murder?
[1:41:53] <Anryk_> More than 60 fps limits some physics animations though
[1:41:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> blackmail?
[1:41:58] <TheFranss> Pat. If 'remove Lala' mod isn't allowed to use, can I request to have a a kick emote which kicks all lalas to space, in the same manner as Armstorng kicks Raiden and says "Dont fuck with this Senator"?
[1:42:03] <+tundraSB> @mimi777 he already plays it, he just won't admit it
[1:42:04] <mihokspawn> How the heck does one get access to the free trial, I am very interested in this game. But Square is doing some convoluted shit and not letting me make an account.
[1:42:04] <%chance_h> Just like real life
[1:42:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah I think Strident might have been the one who got lucky and grabbed this for us
[1:42:12] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Have you heard of dynamic hotbars on PC? It's super clean macro-wizardry and I'm deep in.
[1:42:16] <+flubbabubbasaur> @PatStaresAt how do YOU make money?
[1:42:18] <+Fycadius> Nice glam Pat.
[1:42:19] <Siconia> And beat anyone who tries to buy it before you to death
[1:42:19] <%Mekhet09> 6.1 patch is going to be insane.
[1:42:23] <%kujofire990> or just get lucky like we did with the ELMIG FC
[1:42:24] <%Shirousuke1989> Is the secret to getting a house the same as it is in real life and it's to have rich parents?
[1:42:24] <+brandonsbetow> have a small house then transfer in to a large plot
[1:42:26] <%Mekhet09> because I need a house.
[1:42:26] <%Shirousuke1989> Oh
[1:42:27] <DianaTheAscian> YUP MAKES SENSE
[1:42:31] <afronooch> im content with the lil apartment :)
[1:42:38] <+jinshiroi> Ishgard haousing is gonna be a shit show
[1:42:42] <%GingaNZ> my lowly 44 million
[1:42:42] <+Fycadius> Fycadius subscribed with Prime. 
[1:42:43] <%hrbeck_> @TheFranss Let this man speak!
[1:42:50] <%chance_h> Make money by selling stuff to auction. Otherwise grind
[1:42:51] <%Mekhet09> Oh god it's going to be so bad.
[1:42:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> I think Pat is misremembering.
[1:42:55] <+brandonsbetow> ah, thats another cool tip
[1:42:57] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is it 1 house per character?
[1:43:03] <FortuneEX> Sitting on "fuck you" level of money LUL
[1:43:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> I think it was closer to 4 people
[1:43:07] <%Dakuu75> I really like the default apartment thing
[1:43:09] <scientiafidem> GIVE US INSTANCED HOUSING FOR CRIST‚ÄôS SAKE.
[1:43:09] <+kyrona2> Also did you hear that there is supposedly a Cruise Chaser mount getting added with the next patch if you get every triple triad card?
[1:43:09] <@SpaceCapnCrone> that sounds like a lot more money than we ever had
[1:43:16] <neptious> Plus apartments which never expire
[1:43:17] <+pandamancer224> and an apartment
[1:43:17] <%AzureGale> Final Fantasy: 723846178464712389 Houses
[1:43:21] <allbrancook> Show us your personal chamber
[1:43:23] <Siconia> My FC is staying in Shirogane so when Ishgard comes around there'll be plots everywhere
[1:43:24] <@CreepyPorpoise> we do not
[1:43:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Currently Crafting so I can get my White Scrips, any good macro sources? Pressing buttons sucks. ALC preferred.
[1:43:27] <%Fycadius> So Pat, are you going to be hoarding DRG gear so you can level Reaper easily? xD
[1:43:31] <neptious> Apartments are great cuz they never go away
[1:43:32] <TioXyco> one house, one apartment, one FC house and one FC apartment... that's all you can have
[1:43:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> more than 800 million?! no.
[1:43:34] <%Mekhet09> The issue is the timer now.
[1:43:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat is crazy
[1:43:43] <%Frost_Quill> Isn't there some guy who owns like an entire ward using alts?

[1:44:22] <@SpaceCapnCrone> usually a crafting material that's kind of a pain in the ass to make
[1:44:23] <RocketBarrel> or get very rare drops from delebrum and sell them for 25 million
[1:44:24] <+tundraSB> supply and demand
[1:44:24] <$Ziegsy> I can tell you chat

[1:44:41] <+MayorRev> sorry if someone answered this question already but is housing in this game still busted with some individuals hogging all the property?
[1:44:47] <neptious> The Venture Jingle SUCKS
[1:44:47] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt how much gil do you think you need before you can say you have alot of money in 14?
[1:44:51] <+flubbabubbasaur> WTF
[1:44:54] <+MayorRev> i heard some folks were just buying up every place
[1:44:56] <Siconia> People love jet black
[1:44:57] <$Ziegsy> When an expac got live, Buy up ALL the hq quest rewards from the market board. Wait for a month, and the price will skyrocket
[1:44:58] <+CookieCutter007> EDGE
[1:44:58] <%JoshManVGH> Holy shit that's expensive.
[1:44:59] <Covil91> Hade's Auracyte is like 900k right now
[1:45:01] <Psyramics> where does that come from
[1:45:04] <Nordguy> @patstaresat the restoration moogle bed went way up in price
[1:45:04] <Commander_Spyke> Jet Black is so not worth it
[1:45:05] <JeysJumbleJams> stonks go UP for reaper
[1:45:07] <+SuicidalLemmming> thats just getting lucky with ventures
[1:45:08] <+HelloImTom08> Jet Black dye is the Gold Bar of FFXIV
[1:45:10] <doc_ock_rokc> Once you go black
[1:45:10] <%chance_h> everyone always needs more black
[1:45:14] <MoonKing> @alteisenreisez, teamcraft is what you want
[1:45:15] <%pokefan9956> why do people buy things on the marketplace if they can just get things in game?
[1:45:16] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! twewy anime is ok but really zooms from main point to main point without dealing with the missions that better flesh out the game's themes
[1:45:18] <tanarath> @joshmanvgh fashion is, yes.
[1:45:22] <%GingaNZ> mini skirts and shoes are just pure money
[1:45:25] <%JoshManVGH> What so you just Venture like a SOB untill you have a pile of pots of Jet Black dye?
[1:45:25] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> better stock up on jjet black because of reaper and edge
[1:45:30] <+AnAcceptableName> I need to get into Omni Crafting.
[1:45:32] <%jackythefrost> @MayorRev they made it so you can only own one personal house per character like 3 years ago
[1:45:33] <scientiafidem> Jet black dye going to be selling for millions when reaper shows up.
[1:45:38] <Purpleleven> Did they ever fix that one really bad bot that was fucking up the market on Louisoix from awhile back?
[1:45:40] <+tetraes> is that saejima's jacket lol?
[1:45:49] <%solracc25> Pat builds you buy
[1:46:00] <%pokefan9956> so why do people buy on the marketplace to begin with if you can get everything in game?
[1:46:08] <%furiousfurioso> Yo
[1:46:15] <faldin> laziness
[1:46:15] <StaticEntry> That is just Saejima's jacket lol
[1:46:17] <Daniel_Is_I> Also Futaba's coat from P5
[1:46:18] <Thepothero> straight up saejima s coat
[1:46:18] <tanarath> God, it is
[1:46:20] <$Garthunox> I'm a Saint :)
[1:46:21] <Siconia> People go nuts for that coat
[1:46:21] <+cascadepersona> Hey, I got the Rebel coat for my Shiki Ryougi glamour.
[1:46:26] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt do crafters still have cross class skills or did they finally kill those
[1:46:27] <SaphronBlackbourne> I call it the Komeada coat
[1:46:28] <Thepothero> i rock that shit
[1:46:34] <Sheveniner> @pokefan9956 Because some things are rare drops and they don't have the luck/time/patience to farm it, but do have the gil--so they just buy it.
[1:46:34] <umbraawitch> @pokefan9956 quick and easy to get instead of grinding crafting + mats
[1:46:36] <SaphronBlackbourne> *Komaeda
[1:46:37] <MoonKing> crystarium leves are also basically free money
[1:46:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> its so old now
[1:46:45] <Palpatine11181> guys i really wnna start playing ff14 im bored on wow but if the endgame as good as wow ?
[1:46:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> you gotta find the new thing
[1:46:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's all about the Frontier Cloth now
[1:46:55] <%deejay782> calf leather used to be worth millions
[1:46:58] <%Garthunox> do calf leather instead
[1:46:59] <%kujofire990> go to master crafted 8
[1:47:01] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Shell leather also comes from Desynth

[1:47:17] <andrewoid_> frontier
[1:47:17] <%Mekhet09> Is it better to get script equipment if we haven't played since 5.1?  I forgot how crafting progression goes?
[1:47:18] <TioXyco> that's not the newest thing
[1:47:18] <MoonKing> indigo cloth is still really expensive
[1:47:18] <2DSuperiority> her name is Baseball
[1:47:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Frontier Cloth

[1:47:28] <+BrightOctarine> Hey can you read out the leaks please? I've not heard them yet
[1:47:30] <ricotez> the endgame in ffxiv is a bit on the limited side but if you're new to the game you have so much content
[1:47:31] <+Angrec> @PatStaresAt There an easy way to level crafters?
[1:47:39] <+MayorRev> oh pat has a red cap right?
[1:47:46] <%kainhighwind1990> @Angrec Turnins
[1:47:46] <Siconia> Mlady
[1:47:47] <Strongfish91> dyable tho
[1:47:50] <neptious> It's mostly for the ribbon
[1:47:51] <%pokefan9956> @BrightOctarine you want pat to get banned?
[1:47:53] <+HelloImTom08> oh pat went Hyer?
[1:47:55] <Palpatine11181> @ricotez what do u mean limit side

[1:48:05] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @Angrec he did a whole stream about this before shadowbringers, the answer is restoration
[1:48:08] <%AzureGale> Who says only girls can wear ribbons? Boooooooooooooooooooo
[1:48:13] <+tetraes> i actually have pants like that irl
[1:48:14] <+fetrigon> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE

[1:48:20] <Daniel_Is_I> 72 LUL
[1:48:21] <doc_ock_rokc> Frontier PSYCHIATRY
[1:48:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 72!?!?
[1:48:25] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Show Hades Auricite
[1:48:25] <innocuousGoat> 72???
[1:48:29] <$Faustgesicht> dress
[1:48:29] <andrewoid_> what the fuck
[1:48:33] <Nordguy> wrong
[1:48:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> I bet the dress is more expensive
[1:48:39] <+senfood> Oh, they're Joseph Joestar cosplay
[1:48:40] <umbraawitch> kinda ugly
[1:48:41] <+HelloImTom08> wait really?
[1:48:41] <tanarath> Sytlin
[1:48:42] <Thepothero> yep
[1:48:48] <Covil91> You overloaded the MB query limit
[1:48:51] <%Valdorick> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT MENU!? OH NOOOO
[1:48:52] <$Faustgesicht> Look at the dress
[1:48:57] <%jackythefrost> XIV is hard not great for people who only want hardcore raiding. We only get 4 every 6 months. The main reason most play this game is for the story
[1:49:00] <Covil91> It happens if you check too many things
[1:49:03] <%Valdorick> Sales history menu NotLikeThis
[1:49:08] <saint_ham> the dress on my sever still goes for like 4 million gil
[1:49:10] <Thepothero> fashion is bitch to pay for but man does it feel good rocking the drip in 14
[1:49:15] <ricotez> the current hard content is always one or two extreme-difficulty trials, four savage-difficulty raids and one ultimate-difficulty raid
[1:49:15] <@SpaceCapnCrone> the undercutting on those items is *aggressive*
[1:49:18] <%Mekhet09> Being the first is hard.
[1:49:29] <+cascadepersona> Play Blue Mage
[1:49:31] <%JoshManVGH> I didn't even know that history existed....
[1:49:33] <ricotez> next to that there are normal difficulty raids and trials, expert dungeons
[1:49:34] <DianaTheAscian> Value loss is exponential
[1:49:40] <soprodiamonds> could u show me dancer skills i just got shadowbringer dlc wanted to see how dancer late game looks like
[1:49:44] <+HelloImTom08> pat just buy primal matts and resell them when the crafted weapons come out
[1:49:45] <+ByakkoHQ> economics stream! PogChamp
[1:49:46] <%Valdorick> Oh no... Server hopping for money
[1:49:51] <ricotez> and at least one form of grindable content that's a bit more unique in nature, like the bozjan southern front
[1:49:56] <ricotez> or eureka
[1:50:03] <TioXyco> one thing that you must know, y'all: Raid Potions and raid Food sell pretty well
[1:50:06] <%Mekhet09> I used to do this.
[1:50:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat getting money-sweaty
[1:50:11] <%shurtal> time to SERVER HOP
[1:50:13] <Blank9> limsa balls
[1:50:15] <neptious> Just put up an egg for max gil
[1:50:16] <+flubbabubbasaur> WutFace LIMSA
[1:50:16] <Thepothero> other servers are sometimes cheaper / higher too
[1:50:18] <%Mekhet09> Server surfing.
[1:50:19] <Covil91> The only time I ever bothered server hopping was the flying bed. Because that shit is hell
[1:50:20] <Siconia> Alright kids hide your eyes were going to limsa
[1:50:20] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is the new MMO channel going on so far?
[1:50:22] <innocuousGoat> Gonna be data center hopping for money soon
[1:50:24] <Thepothero> ayyy
[1:50:24] <+cascadepersona> Limsa, a.k.a. Hell
[1:50:25] <+Basilias_Maximus> You can use Universalis to check other servers.

[1:50:57] <DianaTheAscian> THE JADES
[1:50:58] <Revzero25> There's never been a place full of more degenates
[1:51:00] <%jackythefrost> SAY HI TO THE JADES
[1:51:00] <FlaudTheFlawed> The Jades are our mascot at this point
[1:51:00] <+Basilias_Maximus> Sometimes there's Chibi Jades.
[1:51:01] <%Daxalog> Pools Closed?
[1:51:02] <%kainhighwind1990> The Jades always make me wonder why people do stuff like that
[1:51:05] <+ByakkoHQ> i find excal and levi to have good map material prices
[1:51:05] <%Garthunox> NO THEY ARENT!
[1:51:07] <%kainhighwind1990> like why pay money to just stay there
[1:51:07] <LoreKeeper_Thal> the jades
[1:51:07] <A0N33> Oh hey it's the jades! I haven't seen them since I had to make a new character on another server.
[1:51:10] <%JoshManVGH> Do people bot accouns for that stuff? we always have an orchestra in Leviathan
[1:51:14] <%Garthunox> thats such horseshit
[1:51:15] <Thepothero> shits not cheap here pat @PatStaresAt
[1:51:19] <karovus> damn thats way coolier than the naked man dancing at the uldah aetheryte on my server
[1:51:19] <SaphronBlackbourne> I use a third party launcher that lets me use a market board plugin
[1:51:22] <%Valdorick> Someone forgot a 0
[1:51:28] <+cascadepersona> LUL
[1:51:28] <%Mekhet09> 200k sometimes.
[1:51:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Huh, its always the Softpaws on Brynhildr
[1:51:30] <Blank9> so those people are clogging the server making new players unable to get in
[1:51:32] <Blank9> fuck them
[1:51:32] <%Frost_Quill> Pants I wanted were like a million gil on my server, hopped over to Goblin and they were like 200k.
[1:51:35] <%deejay782> coffee biscuits are also a lengthy way to get gil
[1:51:38] <%GingaNZ> no mercy in these markets
[1:51:38] <NeonBleu> price error GIVE ME
[1:51:39] <%JohnAtDawn> There was a guy like taht in Ul-dah in my server a few weekends ago. just paladin standing there for hours
[1:51:39] <xeros720> yeah, have to jam it before that other guy buys it and relists it
[1:51:43] <%Nobrev> my server doesn't have cool caruncle girls. we just have mint dew
[1:51:43] <SaphronBlackbourne> Shit is expensive on Faerie do not but here if you want to save
[1:51:43] <%Valdorick> If you're not an asshole to that market posting, someone else will be.
[1:51:45] <MaxXtreme23> did i hop in on market board scams
[1:51:47] <%Dakuu75> is it easy to switch servers?
[1:51:49] <2DSuperiority> I got a casual attire coffer for 200k
[1:51:53] <Lewtskie> @kainhighwind1990 XIV endgame is doing raids and then afk'ing in Limsa
[1:51:56] <umbraawitch> @Blank9 yes theyre annoying as fuck even tho they just stand there
[1:51:56] <Covil91> HQ potions are really hard in my experience
[1:51:56] <+AnAcceptableName> Chat don't question why we in Famfrit have these identical ladies here. Limsa is a silly place.
[1:51:59] <ricotez> basically what it comes down to is if you want to hardcore raid you can definitely do that in this game but it focuses on the encounters themselves over what's around them
[1:52:00] <+Saggitori> ~~ selling rune scimi 10k ~~
[1:52:00] <LuckyRyo> i've never seen Limsa so empty
[1:52:02] <Thepothero> my home is a degen pit lmao
[1:52:02] <MaxXtreme23> oh is this gil making talk?
[1:52:03] <TioXyco> There's also the Crafted gear. for glamour or not
[1:52:09] <%Agami23> coffee biscuits
[1:52:10] <%Fidel_Castbro> Also maps
[1:52:11] <Brandon__Brando> years!?
[1:52:11] <+cascadepersona> @dakuu75 Servers, yes. Datacenters? Currently impossible.
[1:52:13] <MoonKing> I spent the entire morning of 5.4 making chicken
[1:52:16] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Man I hate crafting hell
[1:52:16] <%JoshManVGH> Jeebus
[1:52:18] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh well fuck off then
[1:52:19] <@commanderclaw> Get a small loan of a million Gil
[1:52:22] <+Hyphixsys> 50mil Kreygasm
[1:52:23] <FortuneEX> God I tanked Felslate during legion because I forgot a 0 on 5 stacks of 99. Went from 10k gold to 1k over night LUL
[1:52:29] <%Agami23> also, making sweaters from stormblood is a good method
[1:52:29] <Finaldragoon> Coffee Biscuits levequest in SHB is easy money over time
[1:52:31] <+shadowsvrse> fuck that this game is way too overwhelmong
[1:52:31] <saint_ham> coffee biscuits is a good way
[1:52:36] <+HelloImTom08> I miss SB markets FeelsBadMan
[1:52:40] <%Kaask> bananos
[1:52:41] <+gutlesscoward> i made like a full set of exarchic gear and ended up selling it for like 10 mil
[1:52:43] <%velemi> I've made about 50mil from exarchic gear the last few weaks on aether
[1:52:43] <%shurtal> i made like 4mil during the Ishgardian Restoration, just doing the Skysteel stools quests
[1:52:44] <RushUnplugged> you're gonna make money over time, unless you keep spending on glams like I do
[1:52:46] <Thepothero> i did offf cloth quaint and made milions
[1:52:51] <MaxXtreme23> aaaaa the amaro theme
[1:52:52] <%GingaNZ> find slutty clothing, and sell if if the mats are cheap
[1:52:55] <+flubbabubbasaur> limsa is the same every server DansGame DansGame
[1:52:58] <Covil91> I bought the flying bed and my wallet still has a dent in it
[1:52:59] <%Fidel_Castbro> Buy the Gold Namazu Mount and start all over
[1:53:02] <%Mekhet09> I wish I had friends to do maps. Seems fun but I don't want to do it with pubs and get ripped off.
[1:53:05] <%GingaNZ> it always sells fast
[1:53:06] <Finaldragoon> if you don't do treasure maps, you can gather one each day for free for easy money
[1:53:06] <DianaTheAscian> I'm a horrible impulse spender so I'll prob never achieve this
[1:53:11] <+HelloImTom08> just do your daily as well
[1:53:14] <Psyramics> do your levequests
[1:53:21] <Thepothero> dailes are jacked too
[1:53:21] <Albafica_picses> are you on ps5?
[1:53:22] <%jackythefrost> Crafting in HW was so terrible barely anyone did it so the prices of shit on the MB were sky high
[1:53:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> @shadowsvrse it's actually not, just that people are insane and go too crazy with it
[1:53:24] <%0rond> it should be noted you DON'T NEED MONEY in this game
[1:53:27] <innocuousGoat> Find your niche and keep quiet
[1:53:30] <%0rond> narely ever
[1:53:30] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Yo Pat, where do I practice my rotations? I gotta relearn this stuff, but I don't wanna annoy people
[1:53:31] <Gates623> Desynth gear and sell materials
[1:53:31] <%kainhighwind1990> I just grind lignum lumber
[1:53:35] <red_blaster> I make like a million every couple of weeks with shit my retainers find.
[1:53:35] <+ByakkoHQ> @Thepothero yes! cloth quainte and nagxian silk crafts made bank
[1:53:35] <+BrightOctarine> Hey what do you do now that you've maxed all jobs? I'm in the same boat and it feels like there's nothing to do anymore.
[1:53:35] <%Frost_Quill> I was around 1-2 mil up until Shadowbringers, and then I got an item that sold for 10 mil and I've had between 8-11 million at any given time since.
[1:53:36] <%Agami23> making cosmetic gear is always a good idea
[1:53:38] <%ShawnTK_> oh you need money
[1:53:39] <+Hyphixsys> just sell mats Kappa
[1:53:39] <%Valdorick> Early Adoption of money making pays big
[1:53:40] <Brandon__Brando> just like real life
[1:53:41] <+fetrigon> true in real life too LUL
[1:53:41] <Thepothero> you can get 100k a day
[1:53:43] <@SpaceCapnCrone> outside of housing, there aren't a lot of big purchases to make
[1:53:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> mine for flowers
[1:53:47] <umbraawitch> @SpicyCheeseNips training dummies
[1:53:48] <feralspidey> Dumb Question, but this is for ingame money? Not IRL money?
[1:53:49] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:53:51] <Explodincatz> same hush hush in WoW
[1:53:53] <%JoshManVGH> Money is helpful though.
[1:53:56] <%GingaNZ> I had a stranglehold on the leather mini skirt market for months, made millions
[1:53:57] <%Dakuu75> @cascadepersona So, could still switch from Aeither to Primal?
[1:53:58] <+fetrigon> secret tech
[1:53:59] <%Nobrev> buy 'emperor's new' gear in Horizon and sell it on the MB for 1000% profit
[1:54:00] <dan_g_v> where is Woolie when you need him to tell people to "Shut the fuck up"?
[1:54:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Currently Crafting so I can get my White Scrips, any good macro sources? Pressing buttons sucks. ALC preferred.
[1:54:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> housing and the new gaudy gold mounts
[1:54:03] <darkjiku> you could buy that luxury mount in eulmore
[1:54:05] <neptious> Those new 50M and 25M moutns too
[1:54:05] <VidulaSaix> Housing, and those big dumb gold mounts
[1:54:05] <Daniel_Is_I> @SpaceCapnCrone Well, except the new gil sinkk mounts
[1:54:05] <orbulon> what about the gilded mounts

[1:54:07] <TioXyco> there's the 50k mounts too
[1:54:08] <NeonBleu> house and that money mount
[1:54:08] <ColRedyx> Say for example, farming E12S on multiple characters and selling the orchestrion rolls.
[1:54:08] <+jinshiroi> I cornered the market in glam eye glasses, made a good chunk, then people started doing it aswell and prices crashed, but I got mine so we gucci
[1:54:12] <MaxXtreme23> get a friend and unsync bully zurvan extreme
[1:54:13] <Finaldragoon> Glamour and Housing is the ultimate endgame
[1:54:15] <LuckyRyo> im so low in funds on FF14, but i just beat pre patch ARR soooo
[1:54:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> I made 40 mill off of buying iron ore from the vendor and selling it on the MB for 3x the price, it worked until world visit became a thing
[1:54:17] <@SpaceCapnCrone> @Daniel_Is_I this is true
[1:54:18] <doc_ock_rokc> KINDA applies to real life
[1:54:20] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt The Delubrum hairstyle was selling for 17 mil on my server for a bit
[1:54:23] <MoonKing> Quest turnins for DoH/L quests are very exploitable from time to time
[1:54:25] <%Deft_Thought> woolieS woolieT
[1:54:26] <darkjiku> and Oceanic DC too!
[1:54:27] <%0rond> you will never NEED more than 2 million in this game
[1:54:28] <+Leftovermemes> There are gold gil sink mounts now @PatStaresAt
[1:54:28] <fritz_dacat> Can you challenge anyone to triple triad. Or is there a specific  place to play
[1:54:28] <+HelloImTom08> cross travel, very exciting
[1:54:30] <+kyrona2> so don't switch except for housing
[1:54:30] <%0rond> and even that's super rarely
[1:54:31] <+cascadepersona> @dakuu75 No, those are Datacenters. Eventually, you can travel between Datacenters in a later patch
[1:54:31] <%Deft_Thought> woolieF woolieU

[1:54:41] <+ByakkoHQ> do you need to run any weeklies?
[1:54:42] <%solracc25> Will cross datacenter lag the game?
[1:54:43] <%Shirousuke1989> Does anyone sell things like houses with IRL money through out of game transactions/offers?
[1:54:44] <+fetrigon> why don't MMOs have like an Uber service for grinding mats
[1:54:46] <%Fidel_Castbro> but what if it was Gold
[1:54:46] <%Mekhet09> Maybe they don't farm this plant because it requires a house lol. Fucking how much shit is locked behind housing.

[1:55:13] <BruTaL_CooKiEz> I also got it first day and just assumed it was a common
[1:55:17] <+cascadepersona> SO MANY LOCKBOXES
[1:55:18] <+fetrigon> LUL
[1:55:18] <+MayorRev> WHOA HOW
[1:55:20] <%velemi> I got the gold one my first run of DR, it paid for my pentamelded crafter gear :)
[1:55:23] <%MrUnKnownAlien> I have been sold 3 since then
[1:55:23] <MaxXtreme23> admittedly the gabriel alpha doesn't sell for as much now. Right now the hotness is Gabriel Mark II
[1:55:24] <andrewoid_> the hair too, early to rise
[1:55:25] <Gates623> Not gold one
[1:55:25] <+cascadepersona> Gabriel
[1:55:25] <innocuousGoat> Gabriel
[1:55:26] <@CreepyPorpoise> Gabriel?
[1:55:29] <Explodincatz> whats the droprate?
[1:55:30] <%Frost_Quill> I sold the Delubrum hair for 10 mil.
[1:55:30] <%Nobrev> gabriel
[1:55:31] <+ByakkoHQ> gabriel (alpha) and gabriel mk III
[1:55:31] <Finaldragoon> Gabriel
[1:55:36] <%euniysu> fragments from bozja sell real good too
[1:55:36] <MaxXtreme23> *Gabriel Mark III
[1:55:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt gabrial something
[1:55:39] <+HelloImTom08> dood the hair cut is still 10-15 from DR
[1:55:41] <VidulaSaix> The hair is like 10 mil
[1:55:42] <Thepothero> ass drop rate
[1:55:43] <gunstars20> SHIT
[1:55:43] <faldin> REAL SHIT
[1:55:44] <NeonBleu> shit%
[1:55:45] <MaxXtreme23> Also the "Early To Rise" hairstyle is still like 10 mil
[1:55:48] <neptious> That was the silver one
[1:55:49] <+ByakkoHQ> drop rate is basically a myth lol
[1:55:49] <innocuousGoat> The hairstyle still going for a bunch?
[1:55:49] <+SuicidalLemmming> terrible
[1:55:51] <%bugz_munny> and DR is LONG
[1:55:51] <@SpaceCapnCrone> yeah, the hair is wildly expensive still
[1:55:51] <DianaTheAscian> SHIT
[1:55:51] <+Basilias_Maximus> Sells that much for a fuckin reason
[1:55:51] <%chance_h> just get lucky
[1:55:52] <%Mekhet09> What's bozja?
[1:55:52] <%bugz_munny> REALLY
[1:55:53] <$Ziegsy> has he gone over gunmetal black dye yet?
[1:55:54] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Good shit
[1:55:56] <%Fidel_Castbro> Is the DR hair also still selling for alot
[1:55:56] <neptious> You pulled up the gold one pricing
[1:55:58] <%bugz_munny> LONG
[1:55:58] <+cascadepersona> On the bright side, you don't have to roll for it against other people
[1:55:59] <%LouieRouie> hence the price
[1:55:59] <+SuicidalLemmming> worse than the hair drop
[1:56:00] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt look up the Early to Rise hairstyle
[1:56:00] <afronooch> im at at leasst 50 delus and havent seen it once

[1:56:06] <+gutlesscoward> my fc figured out how to grind the giant robot mount day 1 of bozja and tried to sell for 20 mil
[1:56:06] <%MrUnKnownAlien> I want the hair so bad
[1:56:09] <tanarath> trash drop rate + farming = big $
[1:56:12] <darkjiku> i only actually done delubrum once though that will change once i get to that part of the relic quest
[1:56:12] <Apolonm> I have run delubrum more than 100 times and never seen one

[1:59:16] <%bugz_munny> no***
[1:59:17] <Nupinoop296> LET THE REVEL.... BEGIN!
[1:59:18] <umbraawitch> there is never a tank swap in normal content
[1:59:18] <%Nobrev> I don't think any normal content has tank swaps
[1:59:19] <%Frost_Quill> It does it twice you just don't need to swap.
[1:59:19] <%Fidel_Castbro> he does it twice but you dn't get a vuln up

[1:59:43] <37calorieghost> WILD AND PURE AND FOREVER FREE
[1:59:44] <CTMathiu> This fight made me yell out loud first time I did it
[1:59:44] <dan_g_v> did we beat Amongus?

[1:59:51] <+Takreth> ready checks let you precast
[1:59:52] <%Frost_Quill> I always take this boss to the north end of the arena, is that wrong to do?
[1:59:52] <dan_g_v> is this the fourth of nights?
[1:59:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> THE SEAS PART FOR WE ALONE
[1:59:54] <ricotez> if a dps early pulls i often just let them tank it
[1:59:56] <%Deft_Thought> So for older content in the game, does it lower your level back to the cap for that content?
[1:59:59] <Finaldragoon> say it together at the right time chat
[2:00:02] <bigdrifter> REJOICE
[2:00:05] <MaxXtreme23> To all the people seeing this trial for the first time: Play Rules of Nature from MGR in the background

[2:00:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ITS A BABY GRANDPA
[2:00:08] <SomersaultJustice> AHHHHAHHAHHHH - sprouts
[2:00:12] <Psyramics> @Deft_Thought yes
[2:00:12] <37calorieghost> i fuckling love how he's having the best goddamn time of his life
[2:00:13] <neptious> Sounds like Primal has trouble
[2:00:13] <%Valdorick> WHAT!? RUN IT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!?
[2:00:14] <SaphronBlackbourne> I honestly forgot like half of Stormblood
[2:00:14] <dan_g_v> shortstacks?
[2:00:14] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[2:00:16] <$Hommando> I've seen people at level 80 run away with that marker
[2:00:17] <%Dakuu75> ?
[2:00:18] <Thepothero> and dont run off for fucks sake
[2:00:21] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Run away
[2:00:22] <SaphronBlackbourne> Mainly the Ala Mhigo parts
[2:00:25] <darkjiku> thats when you pull the Rescue leash out
[2:00:25] <%chance_h> no stack, only run away
[2:00:26] <%AzureGale> Dragalia Lost has taught me a lot about stack markers
[2:00:29] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt So runaway GOT IT
[2:00:29] <anAngryHamster> You are morally obligated to clip that fucker with a cleave
[2:00:31] <%Daxalog> Why would I want more people to take damage. I ask. Unassuming.
[2:00:32] <neptious> Primal cant do mechanics
[2:00:32] <+ChaosAethr> no
[2:00:34] <%Deft_Thought> I'm guessing stacking splits the damage among the people standing in it?
[2:00:38] <umbraawitch> i've seen people in nier raids purposely run around randomly so as to prevent stacking
[2:00:38] <+Renkaru> I feel like its to late got me to start this game lol
[2:00:38] <+fetrigon> don't tell me what to do PunOko
[2:00:40] <%Deft_Thought> @Psyramics Thanks!
[2:00:45] <+brandonsbetow> even tanks
[2:00:47] <%Frost_Quill> @Hommando I've seen people in the third Nier raid run away with that marker.
[2:00:50] <Srthunda> I dont get why some people absolutely hate stacking, healers will just aoe heal
[2:00:52] <%MrUnKnownAlien> U don‚Äôt pay my sub
[2:00:57] <Daniel_Is_I> You can get the dog mount off mogtomes right now!
[2:00:58] <dan_g_v> oh, exclamation marks!
[2:00:59] <+MayorRev> I think that enemy got
[2:01:00] <+MayorRev> the point
[2:01:04] <tanarath> dogv
[2:01:07] <DianaTheAscian> his dog is okay
[2:01:08] <Thepothero> its a beam stack
[2:01:13] <+Manooz> Not always
[2:01:17] <faldin> wait really
[2:01:19] <+FlappySeal_> Incorrect about the line mechanic
[2:01:21] <+Manooz> it depends on the fight
[2:01:21] <%Deft_Thought> Does Susano ever show back up again in any of the later content?
[2:01:24] <darkjiku> i was gonna say why no tbn then I remembered susano normal isnt 70
[2:01:26] <%Agami23> susanoo is probably the second coolest fight in stormblood
[2:01:27] <tuesti> i've been doing the linear stack wrong this whole time? F
[2:01:28] <Psyramics> 'evenly but one person gets more'
[2:01:28] <+FlappySeal_> *sometimes* tanks take the brunt, but it's a rarity
[2:01:30] <%Valdorick> Better safe than floor tanking
[2:01:36] <%GingaNZ> like why not act liek it is
[2:01:41] <37calorieghost> oh i didnt know the line stack did that
[2:01:45] <37calorieghost> i just stacked in for it
[2:01:46] <%Dakuu75> was stacking-arrows icon always a thing?
[2:01:46] <GilliamYaeger> @Agami23 Coolest being Tsuku?
[2:01:49] <+tetraes> use darkest night!!!
[2:01:49] <%chance_h> @Renkaru nonsense, its mostly a single player game with multiplayer dungeons
[2:01:50] <+Hyphixsys> monkaS
[2:01:50] <Thepothero> moon lady has the beam stack mechanic
[2:01:52] <%lucky_icarus> Imagine being a under lvl 70 as a DRK and not using all MP
[2:01:56] <hakumaribo> theres also a blue one that has arrows points outward, thats a flare marker, you want to make sure your the only one in it, and be far away from everyone else.
[2:01:57] <neptious> ITS TIME
[2:02:00] <%kainhighwind1990> Anyone ever wonder why tanks have all the threat? You'd assume the people actually hurting the bosses would be the ones the bosses focus on
[2:02:07] <+brandonsbetow> hell, even in stack markers, tanks take less dmg
[2:02:07] <%Shirousuke1989> Question! What's a tank Buster?
[2:02:16] <Elysium_RP> can you get "ringed out" in this fight?
[2:02:19] <+Manooz> it busts tanks
[2:02:19] <%furiousfurioso> here it comes rooPog
[2:02:20] <%Deft_Thought> Oh damn
[2:02:20] <dan_g_v> yeyeye
[2:02:21] <+Manooz> and goes ouchie
[2:02:22] <+cascadepersona> @deft_thought Trials have their normal and Extreme versions, and they are (normally) relegated to their respective expansions
[2:02:23] <%Nobrev> SourPls
[2:02:23] <37calorieghost> moon lady is still the best trial in the game right? i know the other big spoilery one from 5.3 is pretty good too

[2:02:40] <iosephe> RULES OF NATURE
[2:02:41] <LoreKeeper_Thal> DO IT
[2:02:41] <%Daxalog> So is this a bad guy?
[2:02:41] <GilliamYaeger> @Shirousuke1989 Big hit designed to do massive damage that only tanks can take.

[2:02:52] <%Frost_Quill> @kainhighwind1990 I like to imagine the tanks are fighting dirty.  Not hitting as hard but you're gonna focus on the guy spitting in your eye and aiming for your balls first.
[2:02:53] <gunstars20> YEEEEEE
[2:02:55] <minty_con> THAT'S SO COOL

[2:03:09] <CTMathiu> It‚Äôs sooooooo cool
[2:03:09] <%Deft_Thought> @cascadepersona Ah, gotcha. I saw some of the bosses got new versions in the new content but I guess that was story related
[2:03:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DEFLECT THIS SWORD WITH YOUR GUN
[2:03:14] <%Shirousuke1989> Oh thank you!
[2:03:14] <dan_g_v> Orb on Orb violence
[2:03:16] <ricotez> it's fine, in normal mode a dps can easily handle it
[2:03:16] <MaxXtreme23> @Shirousuke1989 It's an attack done by bosses that do amounts of damage that would KO a non-tank and deal massive amounts of damage to tanks. When one happens, tanks are expected to use defense buffs to mitigate it.
[2:03:23] <LordDudeTheFirst> REJOICE
[2:03:25] <hakumaribo> out of the middle!
[2:03:26] <Daniel_Is_I> REJOICE

[2:03:32] <%StrawberryPantsu> That's his first time doing it. Good for him.
[2:03:33] <%Fidel_Castbro> yeah but have you blocked it with your bare hands befoer
[2:03:35] <%Daxalog> That gun is broken now
[2:03:39] <Finaldragoon> RESILIENT SOULS I SALUTE YOU
[2:03:39] <GilliamYaeger> @Daxalog Yes and no. He's a pretty cool dude who loves to fight, but as a Primal he's powered by literally sucking the life out of the land around him so you have to kill him.
[2:03:47] <%Deft_Thought> This guy is pretty cool
[2:03:47] <%NateyBeak> what a cool dude
[2:03:48] <TioXyco> RESILIENT SOULS I SALUTE YOU
[2:03:48] <Thepothero> nope
[2:03:50] <%skeletonmilk> is susano based and redpilled?
[2:03:50] <doc_ock_rokc> This guy is a bro
[2:03:57] <%CalderGaming> @Shirousuke1989 it's a heavy single-target attack that only the tank can hope to survive, and is designed to test the ability of the main tank to use their dmg mitigation, the healers to shield/heal the damage, and the off-tank to swap in afterwards in case it also applies vulnerability debuff to the main tank (mostly on EX/savage content)
[2:03:57] <%Monkeyweed21> I blocked him as a SMN when Stormblood came out
[2:03:57] <soprodiamonds> a monk doing it would look like Goku
[2:03:59] <CTMathiu> Wait, nontanks can do that?
[2:03:59] <TheWozy> I started 14 yesterday on ps5 and I'm having a ton of fun with it! Picked Conjurer too for heals
[2:04:03] <%Frost_Quill> Do monks catch the blade?  That'd be sick.
[2:04:06] <%Daxalog> Ah
[2:04:13] <Revzero25> everyone can catch the blade
[2:04:16] <%bugz_munny> Susanoo is gonna break into your house later
[2:04:19] <mimi777> that sprout is shitting his pants rn lol
[2:04:22] <+ForgottenVoidCast> Susano is so fucking sick.
[2:04:27] <%lucky_icarus> @patstaresat You don't have TBN, why are you holding onto your MP?
[2:04:36] <animaturgy> DRK kinda sucks to play without TBN
[2:04:40] <%Deft_Thought> Susano finna line you up REAL quick
[2:04:41] <Revzero25> but if your not a tank your gonna feel it
[2:04:53] <%radregice> my favorite level Kappa

[2:06:15] <Elysium_RP> whats the fastest way to leveling up classes you dont really care about?
[2:06:16] <%Deft_Thought> Is Ravana a Primal too?
[2:06:18] <%Fidel_Castbro> I'm sad we never got Amaterasu
[2:06:18] <+brandonsbetow> dancer is just gambler with extra steps
[2:06:22] <neptious> YOJIMBO would be dope
[2:06:24] <GilliamYaeger> @StrawberryPantsu Is simple. Keep your 1-2-3 going, push the four oGCD buttons when they light up, use blood weapon/delerium on cooldown, keep ~3000-6000 MP in reserve to use THE BLACKEST NIGHT.
[2:06:25] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Was that BIRAN BLESSED
[2:06:25] <%Nobrev> he's a yanxian deity that was represented by an old treasure suffused with a fuck ton of aether
[2:06:28] <%CalderGaming> @neptious yojimbo is in the game but he's just a 4-player dungeon boss
[2:06:30] <Thepothero> @Finakala snowcloak for me
[2:06:31] <darkjiku> Do Alexander Normal so we can jam out to Rise
[2:06:31] <+krispen_wa> so what's the difference between ravana and susanoo character wise? arent they basically the same person?
[2:06:32] <37calorieghost> is susanoo technically dead?
[2:06:33] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Hello Pot- has the number been going up
[2:06:35] <lonosis47> That was the amazing boss he was talking about ?
[2:06:45] <%transporterthesequel> Yojimbo IS in game
[2:06:45] <%radregice> i have animations off and have never seen those before
[2:06:46] <37calorieghost> cuz the sword gone snappo'd
[2:06:48] <RaidenRising> they use sonic rings ?
[2:06:49] <+tetraes> ngl i just like watching healers panic when DRK pop living dead
[2:06:49] <Covil91> I'm surprised you farmed out the DNC relic
[2:06:50] <feralspidey> reminds me of Axel, from KH.
[2:06:53] <%transporterthesequel> But not a boss persay
[2:06:54] <NeonBleu> trespassing
[2:06:56] <@CreepyPorpoise> What, ours isnt good enough?
[2:07:00] <@CreepyPorpoise> its only there for YOU
[2:07:01] <%Agami23> susanoo is a kami, which are primals but are summoned differently.
[2:07:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> I DONT EVEN WANT IT
[2:07:13] <FortuneEX> LUL
[2:07:13] <@SpaceCapnCrone> creepy49Porpkek

[2:07:17] <+Hyphixsys> @NeonBleu no one will know, if no one's tehre Kappa

[2:07:20] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:07:21] <@commanderclaw> Waow, hurting Porp's feelings, smh
[2:07:22] <%bugz_munny> why would a healer panic at living dead
[2:07:24] <neptious> Will you be doing DR?
[2:07:25] <Revzero25> a more flamboyant axel
[2:07:29] <%bugz_munny> you need to die first
[2:07:33] <$Faustgesicht> LUL
[2:07:34] <%chance_h> dancer is just playing gatcha for damage
[2:07:37] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:07:38] <37calorieghost> @krispen_wa ravana is more or a conquerer with a high degree of respect for strong warriors, susanoo is just a party dude with a high degree of respect for warriors who can show him a good time
[2:07:39] <%Deft_Thought> Looks flashy
[2:07:39] <+Mycalico> @patstaresat What is your take on MCH? I'm leveling all the jobs and that was the only one I couldn't click with.

[2:07:42] <battlexqueen> I've never been able to get into mmos, i've tried many many times. what is it you like about mmos, particularly ff14?
[2:07:42] <GilliamYaeger> Can you show off A12, complete with doing the portal mechanic? That's still my favourite.
[2:07:45] <%Mekhet09> What's the deal with the button on the top right?
[2:07:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> give me 7 days I'm gonna take ours out and put a gazebo in its place

[2:09:02] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt New trailer for the Netflix RE movie just dropped
[2:09:02] <GilliamYaeger> @hatefuldead666 Use the plentiful MSQ experience to level a DPS, use your duty roulettes to level a tank and healer, grab and level Dark Knight as soon as you hit Heavensward so you can see one of the best storylines in the game.

[2:13:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> too fine, probably
[2:13:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> but I kind of miss that old man
[2:13:11] <+cascadepersona> Makes it very easy to get ARR mounts
[2:13:15] <+sugarfreemixup> no mechanics needed
[2:13:15] <nicegrandmafingers> not only will they melt him but he can't scratch them

[2:13:24] <%SwdVengeance> Dragon Gaze!
[2:13:27] <SaphronBlackbourne> @PatStaresAt What expansions can you unsync for? I know you can't solo 70 content at 80.
[2:13:29] <+krispen_wa> Wont undersizing be harder after 6.0 due to number crunch?
[2:13:35] <Sydin18> Beat up grandpa
[2:13:37] <hakumaribo> dude the ex version of this song is so good
[2:13:38] <Nordguy> you can do thordan EX with like 3 dps brainless now :p
[2:13:40] <%lucky_icarus> Undersized is legit the only reason I even bothered getting an Anima weapon
[2:13:48] <ColRedyx> @SaphronBlackbourne Pretty much anything older than the current expansion.
[2:13:49] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt hwo about Solo'ing Nael in Coils? Kappa
[2:13:49] <Finaldragoon> I farmed the HW birds recently and did it through undersized because I am lazy
[2:13:51] <@SpaceCapnCrone> How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man!?
[2:13:52] <%shadowace2400> it's gonna suck
[2:13:55] <DianaTheAscian> which sucks
[2:13:55] <EndCrawler> SourPls
[2:13:56] <Gates623> @patstaresat Sephirot is a cool fight
[2:13:57] <%Fidel_Castbro> Only slightly the boss numbers also get crunched
[2:13:59] <Nupinoop296> i need to get my Nidhogg and Thordan birds before 6.0
[2:14:03] <GilliamYaeger> @hatefuldead666 Your main goal is to have a DPS, a magical DPS, a tank and a healer at level 80 so you can do the pretty excellent fifth role quest and the Void Quest questline that it unlocks. The most efficient use for your MSQ xp is for a DPS, which has bad queue times compared to healers and tanks.
[2:14:05] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, this dude. I've seen this fight
[2:14:05] <+krispen_wa> oh boy PF parties are gonna suck ass
[2:14:06] <+ChaosAethr> Time for the best summon in ff7
[2:14:06] <hakumaribo> fuck pizza party!!!!
[2:14:08] <iosephe> depends on how the numbers change
[2:14:13] <SmolBluGhost> i havent done ex yet
[2:14:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> Is there a lore reason for why you can fight a boss multiple times over?
[2:14:19] <%StrawberryPantsu> I've only done thordan ex unsynced
[2:14:19] <+GrandmasterBFunk> can't wait to for belts to die
[2:14:19] <SmolBluGhost> what is this pizza party
[2:14:20] <darkjiku> is it just a bunch of cone aoes everywhere?
[2:14:20] <+cascadepersona> @saphronblackbourne I believe you can Solo Heavenward content past Ravana EX with Tanks, and then everything before that with any class
[2:14:21] <+jinshiroi> jesus
[2:14:24] <37calorieghost> pizza time
[2:14:25] <%chance_h> wow nuking that fella

[2:14:26] <Manwad> pizza party? monkaS

[2:14:35] <Blackbeltsam> I've done this one BLU, but I'm not sure which part is Pizza Party
[2:14:38] <darkjiku> THORDAN NORMAL IS SLOWER THAN THIS
[2:14:42] <%chance_h> why avoid? that ruins your max damage
[2:14:42] <+krispen_wa> @Sigma_190_Beta going over it in your head, sometimes imaginging it harder

[2:15:41] <+Hyphixsys> he's now an anime villain Kappa
[2:15:42] <%Mekhet09> I believe you don't get the nice items.
[2:15:45] <RaidenRising> ded

[2:16:09] <GilliamYaeger> You can literally solo this fight as a tank.
[2:16:11] <animaturgy> How embarrassing...
[2:16:19] <@Velyndra> @CreepyPorpoise /cheeron
[2:16:22] <+krispen_wa> Thordan is one of the easiest farms nowadays
[2:16:24] <GilliamYaeger> Four people is going to be a curbstomp
[2:16:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> This is still such a cool fight
[2:16:28] <+Leftovermemes> DO RAVE TOWER
[2:16:30] <RaidenRising> no pat, you are the raid boss for this poor dudd
[2:16:31] <darkjiku> solo thordan ex would probably worked
[2:16:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Zero
[2:16:32] <+krispen_wa> far easier than the Warring Trio
[2:16:40] <Sydin18> You can totally do Alex Savage solo in some parts
[2:16:44] <%ClericOfSparda> You can easily do this with 2 people
[2:16:46] <wegood456> Why are we fighting the Knights of the Round again?
[2:16:51] <%chance_h> just auto attack
[2:16:51] <+ryujinran> I don‚Äôt really get the fun in doing underleveled content
[2:16:52] <hakumaribo> this is a one to one of knights of the round btw
[2:16:53] <%NitronStreams> Pat I think your numbers might be a little too big
[2:17:01] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt do tea next
[2:17:02] <DianaTheAscian> HOLY SHIT
[2:17:07] <%LeiaSkynoober> @wegood456 Pope's evil
[2:17:08] <%NopeBadguy> this edge doesn't kill you
[2:17:11] <ricotez> you're undersizing content from 3.1 in 5.5 so it's just going to melt if you so much look at it funny
[2:17:11] <$RealThiele> nazi elf knights drank dragon juice to primal it up
[2:17:14] <umbraawitch> @ryujinran usually just for the mounts
[2:17:14] <%NopeBadguy> it just does 9999
[2:17:14] <+Hyphixsys> just stand Kappa
[2:17:16] <darkjiku> pretty sure no one does unsyced for fun, just for loot
[2:17:16] <+tetraes> can you do WOL ex?
[2:17:18] <%NopeBadguy> a tick
[2:17:21] <Manwad> just realized pat's HP is in the hundreds of thousands

[2:17:36] <LordDudeTheFirst> This is so cool
[2:17:38] <+krispen_wa> Thordan was piss easy in even 4.5
[2:17:38] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna do Thordan Ultimate when it's out?
[2:17:39] <darkjiku> IZ JUST LIKE FF7
[2:17:39] <%Mekhet09> Playing things uncapped has a disadvantage though, you don't get the  items. It's just a boss demo.

[2:19:09] <%Shirousuke1989> So wait this is Knights of the Round right?
[2:19:11] <Sydin18> For a person who was in ARR, seeing Ancient Quaka still scares me
[2:19:16] <%Deft_Thought> Is avoiding the gaze based on your character or based on your camera?
[2:19:20] <+BloodyBurney> I know it was a different game then, but early extremes dont seem like they were that hard compared to some of the shit we see today
[2:19:27] <Nupinoop296> i love this music
[2:19:30] <ColRedyx> @Deft_Thought Character
[2:19:31] <umbraawitch> @Deft_Thought character
[2:19:40] <%Deft_Thought> Thanks, y'all
[2:19:41] <+krispen_wa> was release-date Thordan almost a Savage-Tier fight?
[2:19:46] <Holycow8498> What is the pizza?
[2:19:51] <+ByakkoHQ> "hectic absolute shit nightmare" is just a good term
[2:19:55] <ColRedyx> @Deft_Thought Which is why legacy controls are waaaaaaaaaay better, even on keyboard.  That and no backpedaling.
[2:19:56] <Finakala> Sephirot and Zurvan EX still caused a bunch of wipes in Stormblood, at least
[2:19:58] <hakumaribo> shit will his enrage even kill you?
[2:20:01] <%NitronStreams> waiting for pizza delivery
[2:20:02] <%Rumbutt> stop your autos Pat
[2:20:03] <%livi242> pat you should do O12S :3
[2:20:13] <%Deft_Thought> @ColRedyx Backpedaling?
[2:20:14] <ColRedyx> @krispen_wa Close but not quite.  Just one of the hardest extremes.
[2:20:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Pizza party is so easy lol
[2:20:21] <+krispen_wa> Sephirot still caused a bunch of wipes far into ShB because people dont do mechs
[2:20:23] <Holycow8498> Why does Thordan look like how Nero looked in the world of darkness
[2:20:23] <darkjiku> its a wild and terrifying to know there's going to be an ultimate of this fused with Nidhogg in the future
[2:20:35] <%chance_h> Lorewise, this is exactly how the fight went down
[2:20:46] <%StrawberryPantsu> 0, 0 (parried 15%),0
[2:20:46] <Sydin18> ...I think u missed pizza
[2:20:53] <Nupinoop296> pizza party?
[2:20:53] <ColRedyx> @Deft_Thought When you press S with standard controls your character walks slowly backward like WoW.  In legacy controls it turns to face the camera and runs forward at normal speed toward the camera.

[2:23:32] <Srthunda> I like your ff14 nonsense
[2:23:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Fanfest hype, man

[2:23:45] <JeysJumbleJams> i'm learning so i care :)

[2:29:42] <+OnyxMemory> @patstaresat have you cleared any of the ultimates with your group?
[2:29:46] <Blackbeltsam> I never see the outside of this part.
[2:29:51] <Finaldragoon> DPS have the best part of the fight right here
[2:29:53] <%NopeBadguy> What could be good content is using NG+ to show off all the MSQ stuff we've missed over the years, Patch 5.3 especially.
[2:29:54] <Manwad> Lore wise, why do you need to kill Alexander?
[2:29:57] <%ClericOfSparda> Oh god I've played so much ShB I just thought "Oh it's that guy from the Twinning!"
[2:30:02] <%Mekhet09> But the glowy weapons.
[2:30:05] <ColRedyx> They're really something special.
[2:30:06] <%BoxNavy> THATS SO COOL
[2:30:06] <%Garthunox> you used to do savage right?
[2:30:07] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> wait you dont do savage???
[2:30:11] <+cascadepersona> This isn't even the best song in FFXIV even
[2:30:11] <Finaldragoon> yeah you go back in time and save your past self from dying in a cutscene
[2:30:11] <+brandonsbetow> because time travel shenanigans
[2:30:14] <darkjiku> have you seen the phase transition in Ultimate though? @PatStaresAt
[2:30:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat saw nothing
[2:30:14] <$QueequegTheater> Bruh I don't even do EX because I have no static and PF gives me anxiety
[2:30:15] <%CalderGaming> what content do you run on sundays?
[2:30:16] <+NeonLight> iirc, Alexander has gone berserk cause of gobbies
[2:30:17] <ColRedyx> @Garthunox Nope, never

[2:30:20] <+krispen_wa> @manwad because you're goblin slayer
[2:30:22] <Covil91> All Primal's are explicitly planet poison. @Manwad
[2:30:22] <%Rumbutt> Only hit point you need is the last one
[2:30:22] <Revzero25> a bunch of gremlins want to take over the world @Manwad
[2:30:25] <MoonKing> unfortunately i thgink all the ultimate weapons looks like hot garbage
[2:30:26] <Thepothero> @Manwad he drain the aether / life around him
[2:30:29] <%CalderGaming> ah exs
[2:30:30] <hakumaribo> we kill alexander because the goblins were being shit heels and reactivated it
[2:30:32] <Nupinoop296> same pat
[2:30:33] <+sugarfreemixup> you can beat A4S and A12S for mounts with 4-5 people really easily now if you haven't, the mounts are 100% @PatStaresAt
[2:30:33] <+brandonsbetow> I hear UWU is a joke
[2:30:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @Manwad the thing takes so much energy just to move that it would destroy the world
[2:30:35] <%MrUnKnownAlien> They ain‚Äôt that bad tbh right now

[2:30:50] <%jackythefrost> @Manwad While he isnt evil, Primals very existances slowly kill the world, so he's got to go
[2:30:56] <%Fidel_Castbro> FISH RAID
[2:30:57] <SaphronBlackbourne> I got my assss kicked by E9S
[2:30:57] <%Nobrev> @Manwad Alex is a primal and primals drain the land of all its living aether just by physically existing after they're summoned
[2:30:59] <%ShawnTK_> YO OCEAN FISHING
[2:31:00] <$RealThiele> yeah yeah yeah
[2:31:00] <umbraawitch> very much agree, savage does not sound fun at all
[2:31:00] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> ocean fishing is cozy
[2:31:00] <neptious> Do you have all your Zeta relics?
[2:31:02] <+ByakkoHQ> new relics next week are gonna have higher stats than the savage ones anyways, i love the grind!
[2:31:02] <%thetunnelhomer> Ocean fishing can be super hype
[2:31:02] <+lucidrush> Eureka?
[2:31:03] <$RealThiele> FISH RAID
[2:31:04] <+theparisreview> Did they ever change monk up?
[2:31:04] <+cascadepersona> I've never seen Ocean Fishing
[2:31:06] <%Mekhet09> Because you have to learn invisible move patterns?
[2:31:06] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I tried to do EX last night and accidentally joined an SoS EX group instead of Titania
[2:31:06] <%shurtal> Man, i did The Twinning before i did Alex, and thats how i found out i already did Alex liek 12 times before i ever actually cued for it
[2:31:08] <neptious> Zeta relics?
[2:31:09] <%Valdorick> I mean... you *HAVE* Ocean fishing streamed... so you've already done that!
[2:31:09] <37calorieghost> ocean fishing for life
[2:31:09] <darkjiku> Fighting Alexander withing Alexander while he SUMMONS AN EVEN LARGER ALEXANDER
[2:31:10] <+Celtic_Queen> Hey guys! WOOW. I haven't been in the chat for a bit and here we are taking on Alexander @___@
[2:31:11] <%radregice> do it
[2:31:14] <28moogles> I always really like the first two fights of a Savage tier, the third and fourth are too much commitment for me.
[2:31:20] <%LeiaSkynoober> OCEAN FISH
[2:31:21] <+jinshiroi> Savage is fun to watch, not that fun to prog
[2:31:22] <%BoxNavy> FishMoley FISHING STREAM
[2:31:23] <+krispen_wa> Are Savages possible without a static?
[2:31:26] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt Big Fish Streams
[2:31:34] <neptious> Favovite Zeta relic?
[2:31:34] <+natjen8> can we do chicken tenders next?
[2:31:38] <@Velyndra> @krispen_wa yes
[2:31:39] <+brandonsbetow> cool part coming in
[2:31:40] <umbraawitch> i ran emex a couple times and decided that was it for me in terms of high end stuff lmao
[2:31:42] <ColRedyx> @krispen_wa Absolutely.  A lot of PFers clear the tiers before most statics.
[2:31:45] <%BioHunter> im at the last fight of this savage tier myself
[2:31:45] <+tr1ps_ax1om> savage isn't THAT bad man. it's like normal mode
[2:31:48] <Psyramics> yes, people pug savages all the time
[2:31:53] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Do Greg
[2:31:57] <+NeonLight> "verdict of history" is such a line
[2:31:57] <%dantejoestar21> @krispen_wa  yes, but statics make it generally more consistent
[2:31:57] <%NopeBadguy> What could be good content is using NG+ to show off all the MSQ stuff we've missed over the years now that people are here to see it, Patch 5.3 especially. @PatStaresAt
[2:31:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> @velyndra Aren't you a fishing god or something?
[2:32:01] <+cascadepersona> What's a good way to get into crafting/gathering?
[2:32:04] <37calorieghost> Sega Bass Fishing Stream When @PatStaresAt
[2:32:05] <neptious> Zeta Relics or Rathalos
[2:32:08] <+tetraes> is the gear from savage worth it?
[2:32:08] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Is it because you have to learn invisible move patterns that you don't like savages?
[2:32:09] <faldin> pugging savages suuuucks
[2:32:09] <%0rond> savage alex 12 IS SO MUCH COOLER THOUGH
[2:32:16] <%Dakuu75> How do you make the chat box's font bigger?
[2:32:17] <+GrandmasterBFunk> THat's a loooooooooooooot
[2:32:21] <$RealThiele> WITH PAIGE MAKE HER DO IT
[2:32:21] <+gutlesscoward> yeah, just do the entire msq, streamer
[2:32:22] <+krispen_wa> okay but is it possible to clear Savages without a static ON CRYSTAL?
[2:32:24] <Louie_Salmon> That would take a while
[2:32:25] <+cascadepersona> Chronicles of Eorzea.
[2:32:25] <+ChaosAethr> oh Paige is going Live now
[2:32:28] <eiyuusyndrome> terrible idea

[2:32:41] <+theparisreview> programming?
[2:32:42] <ColRedyx> @tetraes Not if you're running it for the gear.  The gear is only needed to progress further in savage, or if you plan to do Ultimate, which is harder than savage.
[2:32:44] <Sol_Install> What?
[2:32:44] <%Monkeyweed21> GRAND CROSS DELTA
[2:32:45] <+SH0K0S> oh god i hated hello world

[2:32:46] <%Fidel_Castbro> But you have to admit Blue Mages doing Hello World is epic
[2:32:47] <+FlappySeal_> Currently doing O12 as BLU and Hello World can go fuck itself
[2:32:47] <%AnIcedCoffee> LUL Hello World sucks but not every fight has shit like that
[2:32:47] <%deejay782> kugane jumping puzzle as content
[2:32:47] <%NopeBadguy> But yeah what were you saying about NG+?
[2:32:47] <$Faustgesicht> Also groups can be super unfun and toxic as fuck
[2:32:48] <+krispen_wa> Hello World is fun thoooo
[2:32:48] <citerel> hello world is pretty dumb
[2:32:48] <+ByakkoHQ> more like goodbye world, time to wipe
[2:32:48] <%Arkfyre> hello world cheese strat is the way to go
[2:32:48] <Blackbeltsam> I'm progging E12S currently. Not as bad as E8S.

[2:32:54] <hakumaribo> light rampant is another fucking shit mechanic
[2:32:54] <+BloodyBurney> i think ive only heard bad things about hello world
[2:32:57] <GilliamYaeger> @cascadepersona 1. Buy a fuckton of mats from the crafting guild building of your class. 2. Beat Heavensward. 3. Grind your class up to 50 in Firmament. 4. Do Beast Tribes to 80.
[2:32:58] <%BoxNavy> the fuck is hello world

[2:33:13] <@Velyndra> @krispen_wa HW2 ez, esp on blue mage
[2:33:14] <Finaldragoon> E8S may as well be an Ultimate fight
[2:33:15] <neptious> PAIGE WAGE THEFT
[2:33:15] <%AzureGale> You had a good run Pat
[2:33:16] <SomersaultJustice> FINAL STREAM
[2:33:17] <%GingaNZ> always give up

[2:33:19] <iosephe> no, use provoke
[2:33:23] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:33:24] <+OnyxMemory> Wormhole formation is much worse
[2:33:27] <%ClericOfSparda> But Pat, what about Light Rampant!
[2:33:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> damn, there's 1300 viewers in here atm actually
[2:33:29] <%NopeBadguy> PAIGE EATING YOUR LUNCH AGAIN
[2:33:29] <%thetunnelhomer> I had no idea Plague was streaming
[2:33:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I didnt know she was on
[2:33:30] <%Valdorick> I can't believe FemPat is stealing your views
[2:33:30] <+whiskywolfe> She's attacking from the War Office!
[2:33:31] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt raid RPGBree she deserves more viewers
[2:33:32] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt blue mage stream when
[2:33:33] <%shurtal> YOUTUBE IS DOWN
[2:33:36] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Use shirk
[2:33:38] <+tr1ps_ax1om> gf aggro is OP
[2:33:40] <Kain5707> do HW NG+
[2:33:40] <%kujofire990> clearly yall need to do savage blind prog Kappa
[2:33:41] <Orochi_Sheewa> YES
[2:33:41] <%Monkeyweed21> do Hitman 2
[2:33:43] <neptious> I would if you voice acted it
[2:33:44] <%walternatorz> The best FF stream would to power level Paige through MSQ
[2:33:47] <%Valdorick> Enjoy the MSQ on your own time, with your own character!
[2:33:47] <$RealThiele> parts of it yeah
[2:33:47] <%sick_kickflips> oh jeez paige is on
[2:33:49] <+ByakkoHQ> say no more, the alt is made
[2:33:51] <neptious> I would
[2:33:51] <%Monkeyweed21> do Hildibrand
[2:33:51] <ColRedyx> @Finaldragoon No, not even close.  Light Rampant is one ultimate mechanic out of place, but that's it.  The rest is much simpler than an ultimate.
[2:33:53] <dan_g_v> let's do it anyways?
[2:33:54] <+NeonLight> Cutscenes, maybe
[2:33:55] <%Agami23> do the FFT alliance raids. that could be fun
[2:33:56] <+Plus_On_Black> I am down
[2:33:59] <TimesApex> 5.3 day one would be a way different time than NG+ yeah
[2:34:01] <%chance_h> the MSQ is best played solo and drunk with a husbando body pillow
[2:34:02] <GilliamYaeger> Heavensward would be interesting.
[2:34:04] <SaphronBlackbourne> I loved watching your Shadowbringers stuff
[2:34:04] <anAngryHamster> I would
[2:34:06] <armchairmaster_> W a h
[2:34:06] <%thorzer> even just regular starboard larboard was awful
[2:34:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah a big draw of streaming the MSQ is when it's new to the streamer
[2:34:08] <+AlDavisBoil> Not me, pat
[2:34:08] <%BoxNavy> could be fun :)
[2:34:08] <SaphronBlackbourne> That could still be fun!
[2:34:10] <RaidenRising> maybe you can teach mmo for dummies
[2:34:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the arr part won't get high view counts prob
[2:34:12] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! I got another sub message apparently, so I will say it again OCE SERVERS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:34:12] <Louie_Salmon> On top of that, it would just be CRAZY long
[2:34:14] <%MrUnKnownAlien> I don‚Äôt mind
[2:34:16] <SaphronBlackbourne> Your thoughts would becool to hear
[2:34:17] <%MisterRockett> You AND Paige
[2:34:18] <$RealThiele> its pretty dense
[2:34:18] <Apolonm> NG+?
[2:34:20] <animaturgy> fair
[2:34:21] <darkjiku> i feel like what makes going through MSQ by yourself so good is that its *your character* instead of somebody elses character
[2:34:21] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt I came in early today when Phoenix Wright was brought up. You ever think about streaming Danganronpa?
[2:34:24] <$QueequegTheater> cheer500 raid RPGBree instead, she is a nice lady who deserves more viewers
[2:34:26] <%walternatorz> Do it with Paige
[2:34:28] <TimesApex> Go get that Titan cheese
[2:34:29] <zamzoph> 2.1-2.5 PogChamp
[2:34:29] <iosephe> Completely fair
[2:34:29] <+ryujinran> I would personally but can‚Äôt speak for everyone else
[2:34:30] <+pandamancer224> your ShB playthrough pulled me into ff14
[2:34:30] <ColRedyx> Would you do savages if the rest of the group you ran with had them on farm so only you needed to learn?
[2:34:32] <%transporterthesequel> @patstaresat Just do old Savage raids undersized. That is easy content
[2:34:34] <%ClericOfSparda> MSQ Roulette is the "I need to make a sandwich" dungeon
[2:34:34] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt I'm doing a full NG+ run as a refresher for leading into Endwalker and I'm enjoying it a lot
[2:34:37] <neptious> LORE videos?
[2:34:37] <saint_ham> rewatch some of your favourite msq cutscenes :o
[2:34:38] <$KnivesEve> wow youtube just died
[2:34:40] <$RealThiele> woooolieeee
[2:34:40] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Peach is streaming?
[2:34:40] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I may be doing some of those to talk about psaBig lore
[2:34:42] <%MisterRockett> What you did with Liam was fun.
[2:34:45] <%BoxNavy> paige expressed interest in wanting to play 14 last night
[2:34:51] <%JoshManVGH> What about highlighting your favorite dungeons with a gear appropriate party?
[2:34:52] <Psyramics> you, by yourself, watching cutscenes you've already seen
[2:34:53] <Tracazoid> Carry Woolie and Paige through the MSQ Kappa
[2:34:54] <darkjiku> does that person's name start with a W? LMAO AS IF
[2:34:54] <SaphronBlackbourne> I need to get back to my NG+ of HW
[2:34:55] <+krispen_wa> I actually did get into FF14 by spoiling myself on ShB's ending via Pat Streams
[2:34:57] <+brandonsbetow> alt stream when?
[2:34:59] <neptious> Can you do a Guilty Gear-esque video for XIV lore?
[2:35:01] <+FlappySeal_> Do a mentor roulette night? All content completely random then and you get a nice mix
[2:35:01] <%transporterthesequel> Like kick Omega Savage in the face
[2:35:03] <%Frost_Quill> If Paige ever plays you would be there, closest thing to what people want I think.
[2:35:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> Mentor roulette is suffering u_u
[2:35:15] <+JustToWatch> show us dog
[2:35:15] <+tr1ps_ax1om> why wait?
[2:35:15] <+Hyphixsys> dansGame
[2:35:16] <+OnyxMemory> honestly relic grind is much longer and much more boring than clearing savage.
[2:35:17] <%NopeBadguy> Is that Gief or Elmo
[2:35:18] <FutaSnek> youtube down?
[2:35:18] <+Hyphixsys> DansGame
[2:35:19] <%Agami23> i mean, playing with paige sure would be easier when paige gets home lol
[2:35:19] <%NopeBadguy> Oh Gief
[2:35:20] <$QueequegTheater> Bulldog smell is strong
[2:35:24] <%chance_h> oh god, Pat, Paige, and woolie in FF would be a unique type of awful
[2:35:30] <elbowdeep115> so cute
[2:35:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> Road to Mentor status makes me want to die
[2:35:36] <+Hyphixsys> build up gas
[2:35:37] <+tr1ps_ax1om> haha
[2:35:37] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Steal woolie's idea of "Everything you need to know before Endwalker" in lore terms lol
[2:35:40] <%NopeBadguy> Oh you mean like you Kappa
[2:35:53] <nevan_44> NotLikeThis
[2:35:56] <%AnIcedCoffee> DBD
[2:35:56] <$RealThiele> i call it death breath
[2:36:02] <Tracazoid> Dead by Daylight I guess
[2:36:03] <iosephe> DBD
[2:36:03] <+GrandmasterBFunk> shrimp
[2:36:05] <+ChaosAethr> DBD
[2:36:05] <+krispen_wa> Who the hell does Mentor roulette? Isn't it basically impossible since the people who would do EXs through duty finder are the people who have no idea how to play the game?
[2:36:06] <%AzureGale> Mass Effect 4
[2:36:06] <+tr1ps_ax1om> DBD
[2:36:07] <%GalacticaPhanto> @neptious dude there is absurdly too much to do in a video series
[2:36:07] <DianaTheAscian> dbd
[2:36:09] <%YakumoYomi> DBD
[2:36:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Sugma
[2:36:12] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You can read mine quietly
[2:36:14] <Guardiansaiyan> People are migrating to her stream
[2:36:15] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[2:36:25] <Sulliman34> aw i missed 14. how did it go?
[2:36:27] <%shurtal> Fukkin' youtube is dead, HA
[2:36:36] <+pandamancer224> PUNCH THE BOULDER
[2:36:40] <+ChaosAethr> Compared to dead space
[2:36:40] <%Agami23> really? i like ff5. though i played the GBA port
[2:36:48] <dan_g_v> the tubes are working tho
[2:36:49] <ColRedyx> @OnyxMemory Mount farming as well.  Once you clear you only need to do savages 7 more times.  EXs could take a hundred, no joke.
[2:36:51] <%AzureGale> But Suzi had a pretty rad 5 Mercenaries stream last week
[2:36:54] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, Youtube appears to have shit itself...again.
[2:36:54] <Blank9> ff5 rules
[2:36:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Don't be cowards, Squenixz
[2:36:58] <%Frost_Quill> After fem au ra I don't trust SE.
[2:37:00] <$RealThiele> dommy mommy kitty
[2:37:04] <DianaTheAscian> @Agami23 i think they mean re5
[2:37:09] <37calorieghost> fem hroth better be able to kill me
[2:37:13] <citerel> imagine if the female hrothgar are petite
[2:37:17] <StaticEntry> better posture hopefully
[2:37:18] <+krispen_wa> What, how could FF5 age badly? The gameplay is still some of the best of the turn-based FFs
[2:37:22] <Sulliman34> i still think re5 is pretty fun and hammy as shit
[2:37:24] <%Agami23> ohh
[2:37:32] <Sulliman34> oh ff......im dumb
[2:37:42] <%chance_h> yep lots of mmos don't teleport just dashes
[2:37:49] <+JustToWatch> so they're Weskering
[2:37:51] <+FlappySeal_> DRG's do no
[2:37:54] <+OnyxMemory> @colredyx yea exactly. farming for mounts and relic is way worse than doing savage so I dont understand lol
[2:37:54] <%shurtal> So Wesker is a Ninja?
[2:37:55] <+FlappySeal_> DRG will get hit too
[2:38:00] <37calorieghost> ff4 is still top 5 ff
[2:38:03] <%AnIcedCoffee> Wesker uses Shukuchi confirmed?
[2:38:04] <%NopeBadguy> Dragoons don't jump over mechanics, they're just significantly faster so they don't get hit by ticks as much @PatStaresAt
[2:38:16] <+BubbaRands> So they‚Äôre Wesker-ing?
[2:38:17] <$QueequegTheater> YOU PRESS IT AND DIE
[2:38:18] <+Jack8274> But dragoon jumping over shit is what they kinda do
[2:38:20] <Blank9> ff4ds version is maybe the best gameplay of ff4-6, it's crazy how much more fun it is than the snes/gba version
[2:38:23] <$RealThiele> 3rd stack of xenoglossy inc :(
[2:38:25] <37calorieghost> as a sch main, i also want this
[2:38:26] <%Monkeyweed21> just make Living Dead kill you right away
[2:38:28] <%Valdorick> Funny, so does your healer!
[2:38:29] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you see JoCat's Crap GUide to XIV
[2:38:29] <animaturgy> I want TBN at 50
[2:38:29] <+ByakkoHQ> TWO frays
[2:38:32] <+krispen_wa> Living Dead is so fucking useless
[2:38:32] <37calorieghost> drks give me so much anxiety
[2:38:41] <%Monkeyweed21> what about a 3rd AoE
[2:38:48] <%shurtal> turn the 1-2-3 into one button
[2:38:48] <Blank9> cecil with draw attacks and counter is the strongest tank I've ever seen in a non-MMO
[2:38:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what are u most scared they could do to DRK?
[2:38:52] <+krispen_wa> Get a Fray summon called Brightest Day
[2:38:57] <+krispen_wa> Myste summon*
[2:38:58] <%LouieRouie> traits are great
[2:39:03] <ColRedyx> That's a good one
[2:39:08] <$RealThiele> dark missionary into blackest night sounds like sex talk
[2:39:08] <Gates623> Get voidsent armoor
[2:39:09] <+ByakkoHQ> that would be amazing utility, you're hired
[2:39:17] <+ChaosAethr> paige is having mic problems
[2:39:23] <%NopeBadguy> ESTEEM GLAMORS
[2:39:26] <+Jack8274> Is PS5 FF14 a fresh user base? That seems fun to get in now it‚Äôs out
[2:39:26] <neptious> ANOTHER SCH SKILL MADE OBSOLETE
[2:39:27] <ColRedyx> Would appreciate fewer new skills and more skill-modifying traits in future expansions.
[2:39:27] <Sulliman34> maybe some way to spend blood gauge on mitigation would be cool?
[2:39:27] <+ryujinran> Hire this man nintendo
[2:39:30] <%Monkeyweed21> 1 more combo
[2:39:30] <%WhereIsWill> get a combat raise, but with the same rules as living death Kappa
[2:39:31] <faldin> two frays
[2:39:32] <%Valdorick> I hope level 90 Black mage is a whole new class. "We gave you Scathe 2, It has a separate 'unaspected' meter that gives you extra polygots"
[2:39:32] <%thorzer> second living shadow
[2:39:34] <+rando_0268> i'd love a 2nd rotation
[2:39:36] <2DSuperiority> Esteem extender
[2:39:38] <%Monkeyweed21> MORE THAN 1 COMBO
[2:39:40] <%NopeBadguy> I want Delirum to have an ender skill like Requiescat @PatStaresAt
[2:39:40] <%AzureGale> I want dark knight to get a grappling hook, batarangs, and a batmobile
[2:39:40] <+pandamancer224> branching combo?
[2:39:45] <neptious> @PatStaresAt Steal SCHs skillset more!
[2:39:45] <RatherUninteresting> wtf happned to Paige did you lock her away somewhere with bad wifi?
[2:39:50] <faldin> but make it myste
[2:39:52] <+Cuon_Alpinus> two charges on TBN LUL
[2:39:55] <$QueequegTheater> WAR needs more buttons, DRK needs more good buttons
[2:39:57] <dunkle321> A better healing option
[2:39:58] <+Kyma1020> GIVE SCOURGE BACK
[2:39:58] <%Divryne> @PatStaresAt Have DRK eat Esteem to go into Devil Trigger.
[2:40:05] <DianaTheAscian> I would have said dragin instal but reaper is now a thing
[2:40:06] <SomersaultJustice> dark knight should have a second rotation
[2:40:07] <animaturgy> Dark Arts back? LUL
[2:40:12] <37calorieghost> i think the tanks are mostly in a perfect place,
[2:40:13] <%WhereIsWill> give back power slash!
[2:40:19] <neptious> Give us a DOT
[2:40:21] <SomersaultJustice> RETURN OF DARK ARTS
[2:40:21] <%thorzer> new button > become living shadow
[2:40:22] <$RealThiele> blood spilterer
[2:40:33] <+cascadepersona> @patstaresat Do you think Jobs might get too many skills to easily handle with a controller?
[2:40:33] <+krispen_wa> Buff combo
[2:40:34] <BeatUzumaki> Hey hey, YouTube was acting up, what better time to come back and watch the couch goblin?
[2:40:36] <+rando_0268> yeah the current 123 gets boring
[2:40:41] <%MisterRockett> Lays a dot.
[2:40:43] <%Monkeyweed21> a DoT or buff
[2:40:47] <+rando_0268> maybe some procs or something for a free move
[2:40:48] <diodude_> applies a dot
[2:40:50] <%StrawberryPantsu> TWO STANDS
[2:40:53] <+Kyma1020> Just be like Storms path and give more blood than Soul Eater
[2:40:53] <dunkle321> PLD has two combos and not DRK, it's absurd
[2:40:56] <+Kyderz3> Did pat play ffxi?
[2:40:58] <%WhereIsWill> make it a second carve n spit
[2:41:04] <ColRedyx> @cascadepersona If your controller bars are set up right it's not hard to manage a lot of skills.  If you're hotbar cycling you're doing it wrong.
[2:41:04] <%NopeBadguy> I want Salted Earth to not be a ground DoT anymore
[2:41:09] <%Frost_Quill> Why is guildhest roulette still a thing?  I sometimes forget just how little exp it gives and I always get mad.
[2:41:10] <%StrawberryPantsu> Especially PLD
[2:41:16] <+krispen_wa> not gonna happen
[2:41:20] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt What if Living Dead turn you in to a Zombie that Damage heals you and Heals kill you
[2:41:26] <Sulliman34> i would enjoy some kind of OGCD that uses blood gauge, sort of like what samurai has with kenki
[2:41:27] <%StrawberryPantsu> PLD is my main,but it's animations are boring as shit
[2:41:32] <A_Red_Robot> Souleater sucks
[2:41:32] <faldin> make bard fun
[2:41:33] <+ByakkoHQ> are those traits as well?
[2:41:36] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[2:41:38] <Nupinoop296> riot blade?
[2:41:40] <dunkle321> Fix Elezens entire animation set please...
[2:41:40] <%RaziWraith> Riot Blade?
[2:41:41] <Blank9> riot blade?
[2:41:41] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt dragoon and pad
[2:41:41] <@commanderclaw> PLD looks like a child with a wooden stick
[2:41:42] <%StrawberryPantsu> Atonement?
[2:41:45] <+BomaZero> Riot blade
[2:41:50] <$RealThiele> twilight eclipse also lame
[2:41:54] <Daniel_Is_I> DRG's jumps look hilarious now
[2:41:54] <Sulliman34> i LOVE MCH animations
[2:41:55] <%WhereIsWill> make souleater a 3 part attack
[2:41:59] <+krispen_wa> Your final fantasy?
[2:42:00] <+rando_0268> yeah I would like to use fray more
[2:42:06] <+cascadepersona> @colredyx I have two hotbars that I Switch between using Double Taps. I just fear having more skills would mean another hotbar.
[2:42:06] <+ZipperHands> So what Reaper's doing?
[2:42:12] <37calorieghost> yeah war' anims are also kinda lackluster
[2:42:13] <ColRedyx> Ehhhhh.... They did that with MCH and I don't like it.  If you're flipping around all the time then your burst phases lose their coolness.
[2:42:14] <zerointelligence000> Sorry, just got here and not done with MSQ, is this stream spoiler heavy?
[2:42:22] <Nupinoop296> and you eat the soul
[2:42:24] <%WhereIsWill> thats sick
[2:42:34] <dunkle321> More fray action
[2:42:34] <%ironbologna> ironbologna subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, getting back into ffxiv after about 2 years, only now doing Heavensward stuff. Should i spend the money now on shadowbringers or wait till its included with Endwalker in the future? Not sure if I wanna drop $80 on two expacs
[2:42:37] <theredfox930000> how are you streaming this and dbd
[2:42:39] <%Frost_Quill> That'd be sick.  Reaper seems to be getting that kinda stuff though.
[2:42:41] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Remember when you mentioned that nobody sees the whole Ultima Weapon fight anymore, because big huge number? What about running cool older content with iLevel appropriate parties?
[2:42:42] <$RealThiele> this stream is not spoiler heavy atm but
[2:42:43] <BigNerdSam> Living Shadow 2: It's Myste now
[2:42:58] <Sulliman34> oh yeah, have the living shadow do cool shit for you, fuckin jojo stand it
[2:43:08] <+krispen_wa> Give SAM a judgement cut end
[2:43:12] <+cascadepersona> Welcome to FFXIV
[2:43:16] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah ender skill for Delirum like Bloodspillerx4 > Finishing Touch
[2:43:19] <faldin> yessss
[2:43:20] <ColRedyx> @cascadepersona I find extended hold easier for the second bar then double tap.  I use double tap for AOE since you don't switch between ST and AOE rotations often.  If you're AOEing you're probably just AOEing for a while, so the main and extended hold bars are all for single-target.
[2:43:30] <silver_stout> Hey pat I just started the free trial do you think ill be able to catch up to the main story Before endwalkers drops?
[2:43:42] <$RealThiele> seeing devs have genuine raw emotions caught a lot of peoples attention
[2:43:45] <Sulliman34> man people like the monk rework but it still just isnt as fun as stormblood monk imo
[2:43:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> hw sad would you be if they made it bad like WoW
[2:43:51] <%Takreth> so no Kappa
[2:43:51] <faldin> start NOW
[2:43:52] <FortuneEX> So no Kappa
[2:43:54] <zamzoph> that's not very much given the amount of content
[2:43:54] <+yukichocomilk> so prob not
[2:43:56] <%crimsonharvest> hello
[2:43:57] <+cascadepersona> @colredyx Huh, I'll try out the extended holds then. Thank you.
[2:44:04] <%cvp5127> what cant you do on the free trial?
[2:44:06] <+CheshirePierrot> The AST rework worries me after their last one
[2:44:07] <Blank9> is monk going to get another rework?
[2:44:07] <%0rond> I started on patch 5.3 and caught up before 5.5
[2:44:10] <orbulon> Will i be able to level everything to 80 by the time endwalker drops?
[2:44:10] <%blutzwavedave> You need 191 days, sorry bub
[2:44:12] <atsu333> I mean that's not neccessarily a ton of time if you're watching all the MSQ stuff
[2:44:13] <%0rond> and I did all the side stuff too
[2:44:17] <37calorieghost> it took me 4 months to catch up, 1 month of playtime
[2:44:17] <Nupinoop296> i blasted through the beginning 5.2, WHILE doing side content, in just a few months
[2:44:18] <nsDrummer> every yellow quest NotLikeThis
[2:44:18] <DianaTheAscian> start now and you will be done half way through summer
[2:44:22] <+rando_0268> Enjoy the Journey
[2:44:25] <+krispen_wa> Except ARR MSQ still sucks ass even after the reduction patch
[2:44:26] <%AzureGale> It's a marathon, not a sprint
[2:44:26] <%Takreth> blue plus quests are worth it, the others are optional
[2:44:28] <silver_stout> Okay thanks pat!
[2:44:29] <+Wrenton> 5 months?
[2:44:38] <+tr1ps_ax1om> its usually a shitfest the first two weeks anyway
[2:44:39] <$RealThiele> just do every blue ! quest LUL
[2:44:39] <%chance_h> it took me 3 months to get to Shadow bringers when that released
[2:44:40] <Revzero25> free trial only goes to end of heavensward and some classes are locked out
[2:44:40] <BeatUzumaki> How long does the free trial last?
[2:44:44] <nsDrummer> its about the JOURNEY
[2:44:50] <%thetunnelhomer> You DO wanna do Alexander and Omega before ShB for story reasons.
[2:44:53] <Sulliman34> uuugh i have like 4 jobs to get to 80 before 6.0
[2:44:54] <+cascadepersona> Envinyon has been going at a steady pace through FFXIV and after like a month or so he's already into Shadowbringers
[2:45:01] <%Dementedpenguin> I gotta catch up to current One Piece and enjoy one episode a week Kappa
[2:45:15] <%weissguard> It's funny, cause one of the things that Yoshi P stresses is that he doesn't want people to have this feeling like they need to rush, and to go at the game at their own pace. (I think?)
[2:45:20] <%LonePlus_> YouTube is shittinf the bed hard
[2:45:20] <BeatUzumaki> @revzero25 Ohhhh okay gotcha, I'm definitely thinking about trying it out
[2:45:23] <+Wrenton> Content cycle is always 3 months. But Endwalker is in 6 months
[2:45:23] <nsDrummer> free trial is level 60 and base game and first expansion, its level gated, not time gated
[2:45:27] <+cascadepersona> @dementedpenguin Play Praetorium to bump that up, lol
[2:45:28] <+Fantion> wait what I miss?
[2:45:31] <@Velyndra> blu stream and big hunter stream and other fun content stream when pat. WHEN? WHENNNN/>???
[2:45:45] <+ryujinran> That‚Äôs good advice it‚Äôs easy to get burned out and feeling you‚Äôre obligated to do stuff cuz of fomo
[2:45:47] <Sulliman34> oh yeah do we know the 8man raids for EndWalker yet? like the theme?
[2:45:55] <ColRedyx> FFXIV is not any other MMO.  It's not WoW or Guild Wars or TERA or whatever.  It's an honest to god good-ass RPG until you catch up, and THEN it becomes a good-ass MMO.
[2:45:57] <+Jack8274> FF16 Will  be out by then
[2:45:57] <Revzero25> @BeatUzumaki its a great game, just don't burn yourself out
[2:45:58] <%StrawberryPantsu> I'm unsubbed
[2:45:58] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt actually I think in this case 6.0 does matter a bit more than the ones until than, since they said the story wraps up in it, not 6.x
[2:46:00] <$Hommando> Something bad will happen to your house
[2:46:00] <$RealThiele> but but muh engagement
[2:46:01] <@Velyndra> Velyndra subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! BIG FISH STREAM WHEN? BLU MAGE? SO MUCH CONTENT COME GRIND WITH ME <3
[2:46:06] <%thorzer> thats why i appreciate 14 and have stuck with it for so long
[2:46:12] <+Wrenton> You'll never hear that from any other MMO devs
[2:46:15] <+krispen_wa> @Sulliman34 Somehow, Lahabread returned
[2:46:21] <sandwichpeddler> Unless you own a house then fuck you
[2:46:23] <CruxAustralis> except for Garo collab KEKW
[2:46:23] <%NopeBadguy> Except, y'know, your house will get demolished LUL
[2:46:26] <$Ziegsy> @Sulliman34 the 12
[2:46:30] <%AzureGale> Well, except for the special events
[2:46:32] <rimi_nishimoto> its coming back which im happy for
[2:46:33] <nsDrummer> @Sulliman34 "Panadamonium" is what it's called
[2:46:33] <FortuneEX> I missed the 2 weeks LUL
[2:46:35] <zerointelligence000> Everything I've heard of ff14's development is surprisingly wholesome
[2:46:38] <%WhereIsWill> im so glad, i got everything EXCEPT the car
[2:46:39] <Sulliman34> @Ziegsy oh i thought that was the alliance raid
[2:46:40] <CruxAustralis> except for Feast also
[2:46:41] <Nupinoop296> that car is the only reason i'm doing that ff15 event
[2:46:42] <+Wrenton> @nopebadguy If yoy get one
[2:46:43] <+cascadepersona> There's a bunch of promotions in the coming months from before
[2:46:45] <Sulliman34> @nsDrummer thank you!
[2:46:45] <+doug_famous> Except housing. You can lose your house
[2:46:46] <+FlappySeal_> The only thing that kinda sucks is if you want to experience stuff blind it's borderline impossible unless you go day one.
[2:46:46] <CruxAustralis> Feast, Houses and Garo event
[2:46:47] <Revzero25> i need the regalia
[2:46:48] <$Faustgesicht> Except for GARO
[2:46:49] <%AzureGale> But the Yokai Watch items
[2:46:54] <%NitronStreams> honestly wish way more devs did that. there are so many games that try to keep you logging in every day
[2:46:56] <faldin> YEP
[2:46:58] <Sulliman34> did you buy a Whale pat
[2:47:00] <$Ziegsy> @Sulliman34 thats pandemonium I believe
[2:47:02] <%Puhff> will the Power Ranger emotes come back???
[2:47:03] <%StrawberryPantsu> GARO IS GONE FOREVER (Maybe)
[2:47:07] <iosephe> mhm
[2:47:07] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[2:47:10] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I want the Garo stuff to come back or be purchaseable via mogstation
[2:47:16] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Same
[2:47:17] <+krispen_wa> @Sulliman34 alliance is the 12, pandemonium and lahabrea is the 8 man
[2:47:22] <%Nekros4442> Pat, I've got WoW friends telling me that FF14's cash shop is dead ass worse than WoW's. Even though you can legit just buy Gold through WoW's cash shop
[2:47:30] <truta_> do big fishing
[2:47:34] <$RealThiele> retainers come onnnn get me dyes
[2:47:35] <Sulliman34> @krispen_wa much appreciate the clarification
[2:47:35] <+newbroxes> To a certain extent I feel the pressure to log in every day when I'm subbed to do daily roulettes.
[2:47:36] <+Wrenton> Blizzard would never EVER do anything SE devs do
[2:47:39] <+ByakkoHQ> RELIC STREAM HELL YEAH
[2:47:41] <nsDrummer> get dat glowy weapon
[2:47:42] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Over 100 clears of diamond ex and no gwiber ;-;

[2:47:44] <%justcallmebobplease> YEAH YOU DO
[2:47:44] <+ByakkoHQ> plus zadnor will have so much to explore
[2:47:44] <%NopeBadguy> and also ocean fishing

[2:48:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> pat looks crazed talkin' about the relic
[2:48:07] <Sulliman34> oh GOD rep grind
[2:48:07] <ColRedyx> @Nekros4442 FF14's cash shop has more stuff in it because they actually make past seasonal event items available on the shop instead of retiring them forever.
[2:48:07] <%Nobrev> I still need to do lacus litore but we never get enough people in it to actually win
[2:48:07] <afronooch> ive been living in DR for the last 2 months :/
[2:48:11] <susukouhai> EEEEUUGGHHHHHH
[2:48:11] <%shurtal> Getting my ONE relic was a pain in thass
[2:48:12] <Guardiansaiyan> DO IT TOMORROW
[2:48:12] <Zebylth> do arr relics :)
[2:48:13] <rei0> yay
[2:48:14] <+AlDavisBoil> FF cash shop worse than WOW
[2:48:17] <+Wrenton> yes
[2:48:18] <nsDrummer> ALL JOBS
[2:48:25] <Sulliman34> which relic tho.
[2:48:28] <+krispen_wa> I feel like the last step will be worse than Hydatos
[2:48:28] <+CaptainJax> One character all classes
[2:48:37] <%MrUnKnownAlien> God that 30+ raid I had to do for that sucks
[2:48:38] <+CheshirePierrot> mirakuruCheer
[2:48:42] <%WhereIsWill> one char for everything
[2:48:49] <$RealThiele> omniclass
[2:48:51] <JeysJumbleJams> hell yeah
[2:48:51] <+Wrenton> One character can be EVERYTHING
[2:48:54] <rimi_nishimoto> my friend 300 hours on free trial he almost get every job on 60 Kappa
[2:48:54] <zamzoph> You mean Pat-tron?
[2:48:59] <+Wrenton> omni class
[2:49:00] <+SammyOVision> The trial is good for 8 characters on different servers, but you only need one.
[2:49:04] <zerointelligence000> It's so weird more games don't do this
[2:49:21] <@CreepyPorpoise> HEY
[2:49:22] <@CreepyPorpoise> >:C
[2:49:24] <+Hyphixsys> I love alts Kappa
[2:49:26] <%Nekros4442> aka RPers
[2:49:26] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Unless your friend is on a different DC
[2:49:26] <%ZakGaiGar> I'm the weirdo he's talking about!!
[2:49:27] <%justcallmebobplease> So Minh
[2:49:28] <orbulon> aka the famfrit Jades
[2:49:29] <+CaptainJax> USUALLY WEIRDOS
[2:49:29] <%AnIcedCoffee> I have 2 alts for savage
[2:49:29] <%shurtal> gotta get that ERP
[2:49:30] <$Faustgesicht> Wait what's the discount?
[2:49:31] <+CheshirePierrot> Plus with the data center changes going forward, that makes even less reason to have alts going forward for most people
[2:49:32] <Nupinoop296> i just wanted to make a nice elf lad :(
[2:49:32] <$RealThiele> BIG WEIRDOS
[2:49:32] <bcdenton> I play to hang with people on other data centers
[2:49:34] <%RaziWraith> Shut up Pat!!! Don't call me out like that! D:
[2:49:34] <DianaTheAscian> does the free trail even let u have Sam?
[2:49:35] <+ByakkoHQ> he's right BibleThump
[2:49:35] <+krispen_wa> @zerointelligence000 to get more cash from people who need to pay for more characters to play different classes
[2:49:36] <SomersaultJustice> what if I want a catgirl AND a bunny girl?
[2:49:36] <neptious> You also get 1 character per World
[2:49:37] <%Puhff> wait I get a discount??
[2:49:37] <%AzureGale> But I wanna be a hot catgirl AND a hot elf :x
[2:49:37] <+tr1ps_ax1om> raid is life
[2:49:38] <ColRedyx> LUL Sounds like jealousy
[2:49:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Or they do Limsa bands or something
[2:49:39] <CruxAustralis> I have friends on other DCs, that's why I play more than one character
[2:49:41] <+Haurchefant> I identify as a raider weirdo :(
[2:49:43] <%DashXero> Or super rich... Which equates to weirdoes.
[2:49:49] <Sulliman34> its also 1 character per SERVER, you can make characters on other data centers to play with your friends
[2:49:50] <%Nekros4442> But Pat...that means other people can come to Ultros now...
[2:49:51] <BeatUzumaki> I think it's the latter of the 3 options
[2:49:51] <neptious> You get 8 characters with the reduced sub, one per world
[2:49:56] <+HellCopter> Just do what my friend does and buy a fantasia every 2 weeks
[2:49:58] <BigNerdSam> you need an alt so no one recognizes you as an ERPer in the middle of Prae.
[2:49:58] <panic_rabbit> I mean given one character can do all jobs at once, it doesn't matter as much
[2:49:59] <+Haurchefant> @Haurchefant is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[2:50:01] <%MrUnKnownAlien> But that extra bag space lol
[2:50:02] <%0rond> wait I made another character to try lag, if I delete it it will reduce my sub cost? @PatStaresAt
[2:50:03] <orbulon> delete them
[2:50:03] <citerel> im abandoning my alts
[2:50:06] <FaultyJawa> @Haurchefant LUL
[2:50:07] <$RealThiele> i feel safe knowing Haurchefant is here
[2:50:07] <+CheshirePierrot> hollytonesLove
[2:50:08] <+krispen_wa> HAURCHEFAUNT PogChamp
[2:50:08] <dunkle321> Say goodbye?\
[2:50:08] <%AzureGale> Play FFXIV forevaj
[2:50:09] <%StrawberryPantsu> Die of course
[2:50:09] <%Dregon_Azure> im not using my alt anymore then lol
[2:50:11] <ColRedyx> Well I can tell you what I'm doing.  Nothing!  Those alts are dead now.
[2:50:11] <%ZakGaiGar> Move my gil around easier :^)
[2:50:13] <+ByakkoHQ> i guess it might depend on the restrictions that might be in place
[2:50:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Or an ancient player who gets a cheap sub with all the bonuses of the expensive one
[2:50:15] <Sulliman34> i still like to level alts just so i can join my friends FCs
[2:50:16] <+Frubblord> wait what?! you can move between data centers soon? thats perfect for me. im on a european data center but live in japan now
[2:50:19] <nsDrummer> @Haurchefant BibleThump
[2:50:19] <%JoshManVGH> Trade hats with themselves.
[2:50:26] <+FlappySeal_> I play on Chaos (EU) and play with Light (also EU) buds with an alt. Definitely gonna be abandoned once the DC travel opens
[2:50:26] <Srthunda> they will pat, that are already ridiculus enough to have them
[2:50:31] <%AzureGale> Ooooh
[2:50:32] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:50:35] <@SpaceCapnCrone> aw yeah Legacy Accounts
[2:50:36] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As someone on Crystal, we still need to do something about Balmung
[2:50:37] <Blank9> How about Lost Judgment?
[2:50:38] <%0rond> I don't play that other character, it's retired
[2:50:40] <BeatUzumaki> lmaoooo such a blunt answer
[2:50:42] <%0rond> the lag was bad
[2:50:42] <$QueequegTheater> They've spread to Malboro
[2:50:48] <Sulliman34> i think it depends. theres still features you cant use as a visitor
[2:50:49] <+Haurchefant> @nsDrummer A smile better suits a hero, friend
[2:50:51] <Nupinoop296> Squadrons suck unfortunately
[2:50:52] <FaultyJawa> @QueequegTheater Agreed
[2:50:53] <StaticEntry> dont oh god dont
[2:50:53] <+CheshirePierrot> @Frubblord I believe it would be data centers and not servers, so Chaos vs. Light on EU for example, or Crystal vs Aether vs Primal
[2:50:53] <+CaptainJax> it's a BAD way out
[2:50:53] <$RealThiele> trusts imo will expand
[2:50:54] <rimi_nishimoto> its good now
[2:50:54] <%Nobrev> I'm gonna keep mu primal alt but i'm probably not gonna do much with her unless there are any ELMIG FC specific things going on
[2:50:56] <orbulon> marginally better
[2:50:56] <Blank9> they'll spread further now
[2:51:00] <+CheshirePierrot> Elmooooo
[2:51:01] <%chance_h> trust is still painful
[2:51:01] <Sulliman34> if people want those features on multiple DCs theyll keep the alts
[2:51:01] <StaticEntry> the squadrons are so bad
[2:51:04] <%AzureGale> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[2:51:05] <Daniel_Is_I> If you're a DPS, Squadrons are actually not awful for leveling
[2:51:07] <+PharosOfLight> huh, you are the first person i've ever heard say the trust system is in any way good
[2:51:07] <%chance_h> also baby elmo
[2:51:09] <SpookyBeef7> Can confirm, Squadrons are fucking obnoxiously bad.
[2:51:11] <$QueequegTheater> Squadrons suck, but it's still faster than DPS queues
[2:51:12] <+krispen_wa> Trust runs are so slow
[2:51:13] <Defm551> is there pvp in ff14?
[2:51:16] <JeysJumbleJams> i joined an exp boosted server b/c it was the first one i saw so the lvl thing is fantastic
[2:51:18] <Sulliman34> stinky catte is here
[2:51:20] <+pandamancer224> theyre not bad except on 40 lvl dungeons
[2:51:23] <+Odin25306> i don't know the 60% squadron damage increase is pretty nice
[2:51:23] <%BoxNavy> i always use trusts on new dungeons
[2:51:25] <SpookyBeef7> Trust systems at least function better.
[2:51:26] <+Haurchefant> @RealThiele <3
[2:51:29] <%marsantas> If you're a dps the queue could be over an hour
[2:51:31] <RaidenRising> pat, how is the lag in the game ?
[2:51:32] <+CaptainJax> LUL
[2:51:35] <%StrawberryPantsu> IT'S OKAY!
[2:51:38] <+krispen_wa> its faster to run trusts if you're DPS
[2:51:38] <CruxAustralis> PvPers are all crazy
[2:51:38] <+ryujinran> Trusts are great
[2:51:40] <%AzureGale> Is Pat's voice popping for anyone else of is it just me
[2:51:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> to be fair all MMO PvP is trash
[2:51:40] <@commanderclaw> But that captain's coat tho
[2:51:40] <@CreepyPorpoise> the battle grounds version is *okay*
[2:51:41] <%Nekros4442> FF14's pvp is legit the worst thing in the game
[2:51:41] <nsDrummer> pvp in 14 is like pvp in warframe LUL
[2:51:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> ITS SO BAD
[2:51:42] <fabnanman> mmo pvp is doodoo
[2:51:43] <ColRedyx> Make ONE friend that wants to level a tank or healer and run with them.  When they want to level a DPS, you tank or heal for them.  Makes leveling much faster.
[2:51:43] <%RaziWraith> Is it really that bad though?
[2:51:44] <+CheshirePierrot> doogLaugh
[2:51:44] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just do HoH instead for DPS classes. Also yes, PvP is one of WoW's biggest advantages over XIV
[2:51:46] <%Puhff> it's fun
[2:51:47] <%ZakGaiGar> No, it's bad
[2:51:47] <$RealThiele> is not as bad as WoW pvp
[2:51:47] <Revzero25> but you get really good gear from it
[2:51:48] <@SpaceCapnCrone> the feast is awful, frontlines are alright
[2:51:51] <FrostySnowQueen> rival wings is good
[2:51:51] <StaticEntry> Thats a lie pantsu
[2:51:51] <%Puhff> I like it
[2:51:52] <+CaptainJax> He's WRONG
[2:51:52] <rimi_nishimoto> its really bad, i only do pvp for exp and hairstyle
[2:51:53] <Sulliman34> i find pvp kinda fun! but only frontlines
[2:51:54] <+FlappySeal_> Seal Rock is fun, but god the rest is plop
[2:51:55] <A0N33> I enjoy Rival Wings during Mogtome events
[2:51:55] <+rando_0268> I'd say the pvp is fine. The game modes/rewards suck
[2:51:56] <%chance_h> FFxiv is a strictly a PvE game
[2:51:57] <nsDrummer> LUL
[2:51:57] <TheFramedWarlock> Is there a way to try this game out without paying any money ?
[2:51:57] <+Odin25306> frontline is decent leveling but it does suck
[2:51:57] <%Rock_Fire> Rock_Fire subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:51:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> the feast IS terrible though
[2:51:58] <scientiafidem> It is so bad.
[2:51:59] <BigNerdSam> PVP is basically "I don't know what I'm doing but I killed a man and got a cool shirt."
[2:52:00] <fritz_dacat> Can you play triple triad
[2:52:01] <%StrawberryPantsu> It's JUST Okay!
[2:52:01] <Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[2:52:06] <%Valdorick> MMO PvP will ALWAYS SUCK
[2:52:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt it has good glams and thats it
[2:52:08] <%walternatorz> OJ Simpson is ok.
[2:52:08] <+tr1ps_ax1om> its poop
[2:52:10] <Sulliman34> the feast? bad. Frontlines? fun!
[2:52:12] <%kknutson4> Did u see new RE: Infinite Darkness trailer?
[2:52:14] <+krispen_wa> Rival Wings is real fun, the other modes SUCK ASS
[2:52:17] <scientiafidem> Yep
[2:52:17] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Rival Wings is *great* but SE is ignoring it for some dumb reason
[2:52:18] <Daniel_Is_I> Frontline's a fucking madhouse
[2:52:19] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt PvP is legitimately one of the biggest pros WoW has over FFXIV
[2:52:21] <%Puhff> I like Rival WIngs :)
[2:52:21] <+Haurchefant> I enjoy trusts because it allows me to experience dungeons from a story-perspective
[2:52:22] <iosephe> @fritz_dacat Yes
[2:52:24] <$RealThiele> 5G gang yeyeye
[2:52:24] <bcdenton> Any plans to do a ceremony of bonding if Paige gets into FFXIV?  My gf and I plan to do it for our anniversary in November!
[2:52:25] <Defm551> i love swtor pvp so thats why i asked
[2:52:26] <%NopeBadguy> FF14 MAHJONG STREAM LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
[2:52:27] <scientiafidem> Damned by faint praise.
[2:52:27] <Sulliman34> is ranked Feast still a nightmare of win trading
[2:52:39] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt can you explain those people just afking in limsa all day every day
[2:52:39] <Nupinoop296> i get it
[2:52:46] <SaphronBlackbourne> I didn't even bother unblocking most PVP stuff lol
[2:52:47] <%Valdorick> The ending of a 10 year old+ story?
[2:52:48] <$RealThiele> DUDE I CRIED DURING SETO FUCK
[2:52:53] <dunkle321> We getcha bro
[2:52:53] <@SpaceCapnCrone> @Sulliman34 yes, and also just people straight-up cheating with third party tools
[2:52:53] <%NopeBadguy> I really enjoyed the ShB MSQ streams but I understand
[2:52:54] <SaphronBlackbourne> *unlocking
[2:52:55] <$QueequegTheater> Streaming is WORK
[2:52:59] <rimi_nishimoto> are you gonna record them as well?
[2:53:03] <+Haurchefant> Seto is best boy
[2:53:04] <rimi_nishimoto> atleast
[2:53:20] <DianaTheAscian> I've watched those SB streams like 4 times now
[2:53:27] <%Nekros4442> Yes. The fact that Endwalker's story arc is supposed to end with 5.0 means you should just play through that shit by yourself and go dark on social media until ur done
[2:53:31] <%JoshManVGH> Who wants to work during the event they love?
[2:53:31] <%chance_h> @Haurchefant no u
[2:53:31] <+krispen_wa> Man, all of the parts involving Derplander man in ShB were real emotional
[2:53:32] <$QueequegTheater> They became those girls at the party looking at the camera
[2:53:32] <%Nekros4442> "6.0"
[2:53:33] <FaultyJawa> @Haurchefant I cried more for Seto than for you and I'm very conflicted about it
[2:53:55] <bcdenton> Cheer500   Any plans to do a ceremony of bonding if Paige gets into FFXIV? My gf and I plan to do it for our anniversary in November!
[2:53:55] <%Nobrev> yeah streaming the msq as it comes out is awful because you wanna play it yourself and everyone else is already playing it themselves and it's just unnecessarily complicated and miserable
[2:54:00] <BigNerdSam> Just stream for 30 hours straight, stupid.
[2:54:06] <+Haurchefant> @FaultyJawa I don't blame you. I cried more for Seto than myself T_T
[2:54:17] <hakumaribo> Rhaubon Ex....
[2:54:19] <+CaptainJax> Blind extremes are a blast
[2:54:22] <FaultyJawa> :(
[2:54:27] <Nupinoop296> 3.3 is so fucking good
[2:54:31] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt if you no life it then as long as you sleep some its fine
[2:54:37] <BigNerdSam> Yes I recognize how that sounds, I think the suggestion of self destruction is hilarious.
[2:54:40] <BeatUzumaki> @bignerdsam Oh big brain tings
[2:54:40] <+krispen_wa> 3.3 is peak kino
[2:54:53] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[2:55:00] <DianaTheAscian> YEAHHHHH

[2:55:14] <BeatUzumaki> But we're your pals too right?
[2:55:16] <Guardiansaiyan> w

[2:55:17] <rimi_nishimoto> because everyone stream it
[2:55:22] <+krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[2:55:22] <Guardiansaiyan> aawww
[2:55:23] <%NopeBadguy> I still watch the VoDs for it a lot
[2:55:23] <SomersaultJustice> it's cause people that are interested would rather do it themselves
[2:55:24] <%Valdorick> People either didn't care, or were you know... playing for themselves.
[2:55:25] <%marsantas> Yeah I loved seeing you play but I watched vods like two weeks after
[2:55:25] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months, currently on a 53 month streak! Oh hey I guess I have this too.
[2:55:27] <Zebylth> I watched it in YouTube this year tho
[2:55:27] <Sulliman34> i got my destiny buddies into ff14 the last year or so and im so excited to hear their reaction to FRESH ASS CONTENT
[2:55:29] <SomersaultJustice> and not be spoiled
[2:55:31] <Kogashiwakai> cause all the people who would watch the stream are playing it haha
[2:55:32] <nechronia> Because no one wanted spilers
[2:55:33] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Man being in discord in though are fun
[2:55:33] <%kknutson4> Pat can you stream Biomutant
[2:55:34] <metalsiren31> I avoided those streams because I was playing it myself pvpS
[2:55:34] <Terapixel> I can't blame you at all for not wanting to stream it. Like, people who care don't want to get it spoiled watchign someone else
[2:55:36] <%Quivla> Yeah we get it.
[2:55:37] <+rando_0268> lots of people avoiding your stream to not get spoiled. I came back to it later
[2:55:40] <PerfectShadic> @PatStaresAt How do you think it takes to beat each expansion story wise?
[2:55:43] <%rDAKODAc> Could you record it and post it after? @patstaresat
[2:55:43] <%Blackmage9999> #THE1300
[2:55:44] <$RealThiele> its that i dont wanna be spoiled but i want your take on it
[2:55:54] <%euniysu> we were playing it toooooo
[2:55:54] <Nupinoop296> whoopsie doopsie
[2:55:56] <fabnanman> LUL
[2:55:57] <%Axellogic> Those Shadowbringers streams were legit the main thing that got me through my stroke recovery in the hospital when I couldnt move around
[2:55:58] <%NopeBadguy> TOO SUCCESSFUL
[2:56:00] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat's pitch works TOO WELL.
[2:56:01] <+Mrbaconator> SUFFERING FROM SUCCESS
[2:56:06] <$QueequegTheater> DJ Patled: Suffering From Success
[2:56:06] <susukouhai> what's a turn-cringe RPG
[2:56:07] <iosephe> Get Square to pay you
[2:56:09] <BeatUzumaki> YOU ANIMALS
[2:56:12] <BigNerdSam> Just kill yourself streaming the entire expansion in one night, stupid.
[2:56:12] <%Nobrev> TASK FAILED SUCCESSFULLY
[2:56:15] <%SpicyCheeseNips> A victim of your own success. Damn.
[2:56:16] <%0rond> YOU FOOL
[2:56:16] <BeatUzumaki> YOU DID THIS TO PAT
[2:56:22] <+CaptainJax> How are you to make money if people just play their own video games!
[2:56:23] <SpookyBeef7> You were too good plugging the game!
[2:56:23] <+enternius> The VODs were great though
[2:56:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt would youtubeing the recording of it work? without doing the youtube bit?
[2:56:27] <%0rond> YOU SOWED YOU'RE OWN DESTRUCTION
[2:56:28] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[2:56:28] <Tracazoid> LUL I did that for RE8, I simply put you on the background at near mute. Had to play it myself and couldn't actually "watch" you.
[2:56:29] <$QueequegTheater> @susukouhai opposite of turn-based
[2:56:33] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:56:33] <afronooch> sufferingfromsuccess dot jpeg
[2:56:33] <%DashXero> Too bad we can't get SquareEnix to sponsor....
[2:56:38] <nsDrummer> its what we all do.... LUL "hey friend, have you heard of the critically acclaimed mmorpg FFXIV online with its free trial to level 60?" Kappa
[2:56:44] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Your welcome Pat!
[2:56:54] <$RealThiele> get those people you got playing 14 involved?
[2:57:00] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Yeah I know...
[2:57:00] <$QueequegTheater> Paladin seems very complicated
[2:57:01] <Srthunda> paladin is lame
[2:57:01] <%ZakGaiGar> PLD still sucks
[2:57:02] <%Blackmage9999> Have you seen Mad Because Small?
[2:57:03] <+CheshirePierrot> I'm leveling MCH right now
[2:57:03] <%1shoting> you got me into 14 and now i have orb
[2:57:03] <+CaptainJax> Paladin takes a WHILE to get decent stuff
[2:57:03] <+ryujinran> And meanwhile atlus continues to impose streaming restrictions because they think people will be spoiled
[2:57:04] <%StevorenoElcamino> That‚Äôs exactly why I stopped watching them lol to play the shb msg myself
[2:57:06] <%ZakGaiGar> :^)
[2:57:10] <Kain5707> god 3.0 pld was awful
[2:57:11] <%StrawberryPantsu> Oh
[2:57:13] <FortuneEX> I went from hating to loving Machinist
[2:57:16] <$RealThiele> PLD is boring AND lame now
[2:57:17] <citerel> old mch was rough
[2:57:17] <%Axellogic> @PatStaresAt  I legit want you to know how much the Shadowbringer streams got me through my stroke recovery. It was my main entertainment during it
[2:57:18] <%StrawberryPantsu> I was about to say PLD is EZ
[2:57:21] <+CheshirePierrot> ^
[2:57:23] <count_bob> Even if you didn't get a lot of viewers, your shadowbringers streams are what got me into 14. Thank you so much.
[2:57:32] <%rDAKODAc> Could you record it privately and post it on YouTube later?
[2:57:33] <Nupinoop296> i love PLD but i'm a paladin mark in general
[2:57:33] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Bruh I haven't played for 3 years and looking at the screen gave me sensory overload
[2:57:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> uwu
[2:57:38] <zerointelligence000> embrace UWU

[2:57:41] <%Nobrev> nope
[2:57:42] <+Haurchefant> Well I must be off. I just wanted to stop by because I love watching @PatStaresAt videos after the fact, but I'm usually too busy to watch the live streams. Have a wonderful night everyone.

[2:58:18] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hey I'm curious after capping DRK, what is it specifically that you like so much about the class? Is it just TBN being amazing?

[2:58:55] <%chance_h> @QueequegTheater it's cuz DRK is dark and edgy
[2:58:55] <ElizabethStorm> 2 Questions: (1) Is FF14's active player population growing or flat? Is this #2 mmo after WOW? (2) I read queue times are bad for dps, how do u deal with it?
[2:58:56] <$RealThiele> "shits gonna be awhile"
