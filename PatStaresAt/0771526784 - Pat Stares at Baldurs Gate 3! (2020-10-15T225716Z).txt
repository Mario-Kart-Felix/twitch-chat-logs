[0:10:06] <Ell1ot> why?
[0:10:07] <DirgeNovak> Would you skip Mass Effect 1 to play Mass Effect 2? Same thing.
[0:10:12] <+GimmMeUhSammich> but THACO sucks
[0:10:12] <%ospreyworks> Well, first you gotta get a DM and like 4 friends and play Descent into Avernus...

[0:10:35] <%Broand> I might dip into baldurs gate 2 as my first game, right after my first foray into mgs with MGS4
[0:10:36] <Swagsouls> queue 10 minutes of pat talking about how dumb the previous Baldur's Gate games were

[0:11:09] <leinadtonu> Tacos are food
[0:11:16] <%BinaryFireball> I wish they had an import for bg3 exept it would automatically make your character undead
[0:11:34] <tuskntemper> Isnt there a hard level limit in BG1 without mods actually
[0:11:34] <%PanicSwytch> Is BG3 coming to next gen? Asking cuz I feel like getting BG 1+2 on Switch

[0:23:35] <%scaryboisupreme> I hope they add more races to play as that aren't "Human but ____"
[0:23:37] <%1000_buffers> Glad i finally caught you live! Heres money to spend on fake gamer currency that is totally not diet crypto

[0:24:08] <teach369> It is what it is
[0:24:08] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert hover over the screen for the icon on the right to click on it and reactivate.
[0:24:11] <Dellago> Larian wants all the PLayer's Handbook content in the game. So that includes Half-Orcs and Dragonborn
[0:24:12] <%patriotrenegade> its funny because mispronouncing words is a stigmatized as a sign of low intellect despite there being no scientific corollary!
[0:24:12] <%hahaha1171> goblin waifu time psaDab
[0:24:13] <%realm_forge> I appreciate the illusion of choice
[0:24:13] <savvyguy> My bet is that they'll add dragonborn, half-orc, and gnome.
[0:24:15] <ShichiNoBushi> "Fucking a boot"?
[0:24:16] <@commanderclaw> He goes away on load, same for ranger companions
[0:24:19] <BoneofMalkav> Knowing how Larian has supported the modding communities for DOS 1 and 2. I wouldn't be surprised if they offer the same support for Baldur's Gate 3.
[0:24:19] <leinadtonu> at pstares at

[0:26:15] <%1000_buffers> @PatStaresAt find any baldur waifu?
[0:26:33] <UrsaDoom> I think they wanted you to talk some druids that were sick of their Tiefling shit
[0:26:37] <fearjunkie> especially because Warlocks have very few spell slots naturally
[0:26:38] <dinnydanny777> Who is best boy and girl
[0:26:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Every group needs a lameoid like Gale. He's like the Karen. No not that Karen.
[0:26:42] <cheapdoc> Don't forget to altF4 to check your character sheet

[0:27:40] <fearjunkie> Artificers and Blood Hunters
[0:27:48] <BlkFlameKami> pa(tri)ck rat

[0:28:04] <StencilOST> Is the game quiet to anyone else?
[0:28:04] <%AncelDeLambert> seriously, devs, don't let me pick up junk. Just don't. Just have my character decide it's not worth it and have it be background
[0:28:17] <+clov_a> this paddington looking mf

[0:29:19] <sealbop> Yea
[0:29:23] <dinnydanny777> "As a Tiefling..."
[0:29:25] <%Darren716> Call up the NAATP
[0:29:25] <+tigerfang86> SHES TOO RACIST
[0:29:28] <+tigerfang86> PLEASE UNDERSTAND
[0:29:29] <Samaugsch2> Hooray for racism!
[0:29:31] <%MonsterEnvy> The Teiflings already got kicked out of their old city
[0:29:32] <Xelgus> oh, the twitch add-on works with adblock now
[0:29:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Tieflings are all nobles, so fukkem
[0:29:48] <M0untain_wolf> Sell sell sell!
[0:29:49] <leinadtonu> sell all
[0:29:51] <+Merhabi> I hope Pat sees the issue with the selling too, this was rough on me
[0:29:53] <%vibe__lord> Come get your Tief Card Plus
[0:29:56] <jacknerik> Pat sell that ring you're wearing
[0:29:58] <UrsaDoom> This game needs inventory categories
[0:29:59] <leinadtonu> good armor
[0:30:00] <fearjunkie> why am i not surprised pat went goolock
[0:30:06] <%ClericOfSparda> Buy at full price, sell at half
[0:30:06] <tannu_tuva> where is the baby, i would like to see the baby
[0:30:06] <%za7az> Here we go psaGoblin
[0:30:07] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Can we make new slurs for all the races you meet?
[0:30:08] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the same as DOS2
[0:30:09] <tanarath> BUY SELL BUY SELL BUY SELL
[0:30:09] <%BinaryFireball> YOU CAN DOUBLE CLICK I LEARNED
[0:30:11] <Nedzach> Savescum and pickpocket
[0:30:15] <butthurtdave> Is there a "distribute weight" button
[0:30:19] <Xelgus> I really don't like divinity's selling mechanics
[0:30:29] <Nedzach> also, up on the screen there is a Trade - Barter thingy
[0:30:43] <juarezgorgeous> This just looks like DOS3 and I love it
[0:30:45] <leinadtonu> food is super useful to heal
[0:30:48] <fearjunkie> what pact did he do
[0:30:48] <%Lion_kun> Its Pat on the right.
[0:30:49] <%AncelDeLambert> the power of SCROOOOOOOOLLS!
[0:30:50] <BoneofMalkav> It IS divinity's, Everything is Divinity's. It's Divinity: Baldur's Gate LUL
[0:30:51] <Nedzach> Now you just sell
[0:30:51] <%Frost_Quill> I missed last stream, does he not need Kanon's belongings?
[0:30:54] <+branlomanche> dont sell food it give hp
[0:30:55] <%Parapattern> Skull and cups?
[0:30:55] <cheapdoc> This regular ass salesman is already level 3 ... if he had a class, he would've unlocked his subclass
[0:30:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> eh?
[0:30:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Scrolls rule, they're free spell slots, always have like ten on you
[0:31:00] <+Merhabi> I sold like 800 gold of shit for way less because i expected it to auto balance the gold as i added more
[0:31:05] <Nedzach> instead of choosing what the vendor gives you back
[0:31:10] <wasdknife> looks similar to the old fallow games
[0:31:11] <%BinaryFireball> @BoneofMalkav not a horrible thing tbh
[0:31:12] <%RyTYoung> oh no I'm late I was playing yakuzies 0
[0:31:13] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt you can also just steal everything
[0:31:13] <fearjunkie> spell scrolls kick ass
[0:31:14] <butthurtdave> god I hope you can play as a skeleton in this game
[0:31:19] <+Kyros_v76> I think you can barter with most NPCs. When talking to them there should be a barter option in the bottom right corner
[0:31:21] <M0untain_wolf> position seller
[0:31:30] <BoneofMalkav> I know, not a horrible thing about that :)
[0:31:33] <%Ixiah> What are the odds Pat will make the 5th edition version of a kaze no kama because god forbid you dont play hyper optimzed no fun builds Kappa
[0:31:35] <%Frost_Quill> But what if you DO need it Pat?
[0:31:35] <%SirGO0SE> drinkin out of cups, bein a bitch
[0:31:40] <Samaugsch2> @thewoodentree I’ve heard “knife ear” used as a slur for elves
[0:31:52] <%patriotrenegade> skulls are rad tho
[0:31:53] <tannu_tuva> my brain is PTSD'd from belladona from playing kingdom come
[0:31:54] <fearjunkie> i hope this leads to pat playing actual tabletop dnd
[0:31:55] <+maximumcrit> yeah i don't think theres crafting implemented yet, so just sell the crap you don't need
[0:31:56] <Thewoodentree> Im getting witcher 3 flashbacks
[0:31:59] <Psyramics> if you throw out the tea set, the vampire will be pissed
[0:32:00] <%rasterman> grease is actually super useful
[0:32:01] <%Parapattern> "My red ruby grease!"
[0:32:07] <Thewoodentree> @Samaugsch2 An oldy but a goody
[0:32:10] <%AncelDeLambert> did that rat tale say "Our Mind"?
[0:32:16] <leinadtonu> greas ia useful to combo with fire
[0:32:16] <thelonechris> WutFace
[0:32:17] <M0untain_wolf> But Pat the CRAFFTING
[0:32:18] <BoneofMalkav> ROFL
[0:32:19] <%AncelDeLambert> ...wut?
[0:32:20] <%Captain_Joe1911> heart2Eundoling
[0:32:21] <%twistedj3ster> wtf was that
[0:32:23] <%AncelDeLambert> what happened?
[0:32:24] <%zibibberoonie> Click the scales
[0:32:24] <%heartlesshealer> longshanks is a d&d slur for taller races, though not sure if only from goblins
[0:32:25] <butthurtdave> wait what problem
[0:32:27] <+Merhabi> Issue 1>Check
[0:32:27] <%Frost_Quill> ???
[0:32:27] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Could you imagine if a merchent in a game had a limit on the amount of things you could sell to them? Thatd be awful
[0:32:28] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Tha hell was that noise?
[0:32:28] <%Meekest> EEEUUUUUGGGHH
[0:32:28] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt this is why I just steal everything
[0:32:29] <%RyTYoung> woolieMINHMAX
[0:32:29] <Tuna_Can_0> distThink
[0:32:29] <rcand9> PogChamp
[0:32:30] <@commanderclaw> Click the scales
[0:32:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I blinked, what?
[0:32:30] <%heyitsbrian> ???
[0:32:31] <ToneBacas> nani
[0:32:32] <fearjunkie> ???
[0:32:32] <%Darren716> Huh
[0:32:34] <%heartlesshealer> Pat dying???????
[0:32:34] <%TheWinged7> wait what just happened?
[0:32:35] <%Captain_Joe1911> mimi007 ?
[0:32:37] <cheapdoc> Why wouldn't they have a shared inventory
[0:32:38] <%RyanGelatin> rippppp
[0:32:38] <tannu_tuva> monkaS
[0:32:39] <%CalderGaming> why do people need to go out of their way to be fantasy-racist
[0:32:40] <+BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[0:32:40] <ToneBacas> explain in greater detail
[0:32:41] <Thewoodentree> Pat starts a metal band
[0:32:43] <fritz_dacat> Oh noo
[0:32:43] <powerprotoman> why wouldnt it be?
[0:32:43] <%Ne1son> He Fiigured it out
[0:32:47] <Xelgus> AND Charisma changes the prices you get!
[0:32:48] <leinadtonu> yup
[0:32:50] <%realm_forge> Did pat just shit himself?
[0:32:50] <%scaryboisupreme> oh fuck separate inventories
[0:32:51] <%Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[0:32:52] <%Sotetsu> Is it about bay leaf??
[0:32:52] <%RyTYoung> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:32:53] <%SABiscotti> finish the transaction first
[0:32:53] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't this EXACTLY the same as DOS2?
[0:32:57] <butthurtdave> Oh that "this will cancel this interaction" shit?
[0:32:59] <%JohnAtDawn> Is this a rerun or am I tripping??
[0:32:59] <fearjunkie> oooooooooof.
[0:33:00] <%Darren716> Oh fuck that
[0:33:02] <rcand9> gross
[0:33:05] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt yeah divinity used the exact same system
[0:33:07] <%BinaryFireball> then you have to stack your golds after
[0:33:08] <%AncelDeLambert> this was in DOS2 as well, this isn't new
[0:33:12] <%heartlesshealer> Each set of inventory. Makes sense
[0:33:14] <+Merhabi> eh she picked it up
[0:33:18] <Xelgus> fucking charisma bullshit. just take the highest party member's value. please.
[0:33:19] <%shurtal> greatclub, more like okayclub
[0:33:19] <+razielhex> It's better than a "Good Club"
[0:33:21] <rcand9> thats the wrong way to do it
[0:33:22] <%PanicSwytch> They should have 1 unified inventory
[0:33:22] <%heartlesshealer> Unload your mules, man
[0:33:23] <Goodvibes99508> so the prices change per CHA?
[0:33:23] <%UltramagnumPi > RIP game its now shit teir shit
[0:33:26] <butthurtdave> Cant wait for mods to clean up some of these problems
[0:33:27] <M0untain_wolf> Great club good for skele
[0:33:28] <%zibibberoonie> Character gold is faithful but strange for a video game adaptation
[0:33:30] <savvyguy> from the bugbear?
[0:33:33] <leinadtonu> This is one of the first things they have to fix
[0:33:38] <tannu_tuva> the last thing we need is to relearn trade mechanics, so I'm glad the UI is the same
[0:33:39] <%toastybites> Please tell me they've revamped their inventory management problems that were in DOS2
[0:33:40] <dinnydanny777> This literally looks like a Neverwinter Nights shop
[0:33:44] <%heartlesshealer> OH. The prices are per character. Fuck that!
[0:33:52] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why you make your highest barter skill character the party pack mule
[0:33:52] <powerprotoman> this needs to be doubled down super hard
[0:33:53] <%Sotetsu> @neonpopt Thank you for the sub psaUp
[0:33:58] <%Ranryu692> It's how D&D works
[0:33:58] <+maximumcrit> yeah my only complaint about the game is the inventory management, everything else is Kreygasm
[0:34:02] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt this is a direct port of the Divinoty OS 2 shop
[0:34:04] <butthurtdave> Can you mark items as junk and have a "sell all junk" button?
[0:34:05] <fearjunkie> anti quality of life feature
[0:34:06] <Ell1ot> or you could not pick up everything
[0:34:06] <M0untain_wolf> fly away now?
[0:34:07] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt will this come to xbox?
[0:34:09] <%twistedj3ster> like a flock of seagulls
[0:34:09] <+razielhex> When Paladin and Bard get to the game, they will do all shopping
[0:34:09] <voodoolawyer> maybe twitch integration can affect in game charisma
[0:34:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Needs a Barter All option and a mark-for-sale option
[0:34:15] <voodoolawyer> every 100 watching gives you another point of charisma
[0:34:18] <M0untain_wolf> This isnt how DND works
[0:34:20] <dinnydanny777> That's how D&D works Kappa
[0:34:20] <%AncelDeLambert> parties should pool non-combat skill points
[0:34:27] <%Sotetsu> I really don't like the Divinity Engine.
[0:34:31] <tannu_tuva> monkaS
[0:34:37] <$Caped_Eggy> Isn't Jesus a virgin?
[0:34:38] <Saltmeisterr> fuck ass shit indeed
[0:34:41] <%Calek> definitely not how DnD works in the real world
[0:34:45] <wraithtaker162> well that was certainly a note to enter the stream on
[0:34:47] <ToneBacas> so you get better prices depending on the character stats for the people holding the items?
[0:34:47] <butthurtdave> guy doesnt have enough money to barter pat
[0:34:48] <+razielhex> PISS
[0:34:50] <%Meekest> Pat limited gold on merchants
[0:34:50] <leinadtonu> Kingmaker has a great system to streamline buying and selling. hope they copy it
[0:34:50] <cheapdoc> No, dnd would be like, tell me what you want deduce the gold or would be an individual conversation. This is just ass
[0:34:51] <+razielhex> PISS IN MY ASS
[0:34:56] <%Sotetsu> psaPat
[0:34:57] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I like it, but I like weird systems like thiss
[0:34:57] <%MisterTylerrr> I like her axe
[0:35:01] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt i mean even in real DnD you probably just send your face to trade and buy and rest just loiter
[0:35:03] <Tuna_Can_0> I had to funnel all my garbage to the character with the most strength
[0:35:05] <%Meekest> wow
[0:35:05] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, if you're shopping as a party in single player, just do the one charisma roll and then everyone's part of that group, a la Follow the Expert
[0:35:06] <%YourFavoriteShiba> *Can't barter everything at once* Pat: JESUS WEPT
[0:35:08] <fearjunkie> whyyyyyy
[0:35:11] <voodoolawyer> @Calek not true, actually. my buddies and I ran a campaign and my buddy lost charisma points because nobody would watch his stream
[0:35:11] <%realm_forge> Pats really unleashing the French
[0:35:11] <+Cn_alpha_02> Pat look at stores available gold.
[0:35:11] <leinadtonu> yup
[0:35:13] <powerprotoman> why wouldnt it?
[0:35:15] <usurper_sos> TAINT
[0:35:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There's a series of category buttons up top
[0:35:18] <ToneBacas> put a buyback tab, cmon
[0:35:19] <%VioletHeart> Pat doesn't mean in the tabletop D&D, he means if you played this game multiplayer with other real humans playing other party members.
[0:35:21] <Thewoodentree> Cottin Hill lokkin as dwarf
[0:35:24] <%za7az> lewd
[0:35:26] <butthurtdave> There's no Identifying Items in this are there?
[0:35:26] <tanarath> @patriotrenegade
[0:35:28] <%strugglepunk2> Pat don't trade that he doesn't have enough gold
[0:35:29] <dinnydanny777> Where is the Sell Junk button
[0:35:30] <%zibibberoonie> Buyback screen
[0:35:32] <%Ne1son> +1 leather armor though
[0:35:32] <tanarath> ack, sorry
[0:35:33] <%SABiscotti> the merchant is out of gold, Pat
[0:35:34] <Tuna_Can_0> what are your items, and whats his now. WHO KNOWS KEKW
[0:35:39] <leinadtonu> axe is good for rogue
[0:35:39] <%the38bandit> that happened in divinity too, i hated it
[0:35:39] <tannu_tuva> this is a christian baldurs gate 3 stream please watch language
[0:35:42] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt ther'es another vendor with better stuff nearby
[0:35:46] <%heartlesshealer> Pat
[0:35:51] <tanarath> @patstaresat are you selling a magic item?
[0:35:54] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt he has no gold pat
[0:35:55] <%heartlesshealer> NPC Gold is not infinite!
[0:35:56] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU SHOULD GIVE A SHIT ABOUT SCROLLS
[0:35:58] <%AncelDeLambert> BUY THEM ALL
[0:36:02] <ruemika> Literally they hold these items FOREVER too. It was so bad in Divinity.
[0:36:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yo get those shanties
[0:36:04] <usurper_sos> The bitch queen?
[0:36:10] <+razielhex> you suck A-R-Ron
[0:36:10] <+Merhabi> buy stuff from him first
[0:36:10] <%strugglepunk2> oh, he saw it
[0:36:11] <dinnydanny777> Scrolldur's Gate
[0:36:12] <butthurtdave> Can you learn spells through scrolls
[0:36:13] <%AncelDeLambert> you SHOULD
[0:36:15] <%heartlesshealer> NPC GOLD AMOUNT LIKE ELDER SCROLLS
[0:36:15] <%zibibberoonie> Take all of his money
[0:36:20] <+maximumcrit> scrolls are great LUL
[0:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> suboptimal noob, got it
[0:36:27] <wraithtaker162> hey now, scrolls are great for my wizard
[0:36:27] <+tigerfang86> Damn scroll readers
[0:36:28] <%strugglepunk2> it actually never occurred to me that he could have seen it.
[0:36:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Should you not use the Scrolls ot teach Gale spells
[0:36:30] <%heartlesshealer> You need to read to use scrolls
[0:36:33] <%RyanGelatin> you literally have to be literate to use them
[0:36:34] <dinnydanny777> Is this a mind goblins thing?
[0:36:34] <%Calek> spell scrolls are for wizards to expand their library
[0:36:34] <%strugglepunk2> Sorry i guess, pat.
[0:36:34] <Ipsenscastle> how could you use a scroll if you're illiterate?\
[0:36:35] <powerprotoman> spells for the illiterate, so perfect for you
[0:36:35] <tuskntemper> scrolls are free spell slots you scrub
[0:36:37] <Xelgus> Pat, you're a warlock. the most illiterate of the casters
[0:36:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Elder Scrolls are for the hella illiterate.
[0:36:39] <BlkFlameKami> actual crazy talk
[0:36:40] <Goodvibes99508> GIVE THEM TO GALE
[0:36:40] <+Merhabi> scrolls are super handy tho
[0:36:40] <%TheWinged7> there were a handfull that were must have in divinity, but yeah
[0:36:41] <%VioletHeart> If anything using a spell off of a written scroll is the opposite of a spell for the illterate.
[0:36:41] <%Broand> You can use scrolls to learn new spells if you're a wizard right?
[0:36:41] <%zibibberoonie> Consumable spells
[0:36:42] <tannu_tuva> @heartlesshealer it's a barter system so it makes sense
[0:36:42] <Thewoodentree> scrolls are for losers that suck at magic
[0:36:43] <fearjunkie> THEY ARE SCROLLS HOW ARE THEY FOR THE ILLITERATE??(
[0:36:43] <leinadtonu> scrolls are super useful
[0:36:44] <Sulliman34> pat you literally get your powers from someone else because your character's dumbass cant cast themself
[0:36:45] <%Ne1son> You have to be able to read to use them pat
[0:36:45] <cheapdoc> can't you make a wizard copy some scrolls to have those spells forever???
[0:36:45] <+captain_history> scrolls are for learning spells with a wizard
[0:36:46] <BoneofMalkav> Don't you have to be literate to READ the scrolls? LUL
[0:36:48] <rcand9> divinity had tons of scrolls
[0:36:49] <tanarath> Pat's goblins flaring up if he even thinks about a consumeable.
[0:36:51] <wraithtaker162> I don't even have to worry about mindgoblins when I just eat the scroll to learn its power
[0:36:52] <prime_name> where goblin?
[0:36:56] <+Merhabi> do you need that? Pat? Do you need that pear?
[0:36:56] <M0untain_wolf> Eat the pear Pat
[0:37:02] <usurper_sos> Literally the dumbest mindgoblins
[0:37:09] <%realm_forge> I hear ginger dwarf orb squeezings go for a high price to potion makers
[0:37:13] <BlkFlameKami> LUL
[0:37:15] <%heartlesshealer> @tannu_tuva I get it, but it seemed like Pat wasn't seeing the amount of gold left on the npc just now
[0:37:16] <kylejefferies> Is this session 3 or 4?
[0:37:18] <PirateMike_> indeed
[0:37:19] <%scaryboisupreme> Fuck this dude
[0:37:20] <+Merhabi> Uh-huh
[0:37:21] <Ell1ot> or they can let you complain
[0:37:21] <M0untain_wolf> Better inventory would be nice
[0:37:22] <wraithtaker162> Look, if we had those endless bags from divinity it would be fine
[0:37:22] <Junkles> scrolls are consumable, so you can't use them because they'll run out
[0:37:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Kill him
[0:37:25] <BlkFlameKami> larian themselves will have to slay pat's goblins
[0:37:26] <%Ne1son> Good talk
[0:37:27] <+tigerfang86> I'm like a COOLER red really

[0:51:58] <%Parapattern> Warlock Bois

[0:51:58] <%Ne1son> YEYEYE
[0:51:59] <wraithtaker162> hexblade isn't in yet
[0:51:59] <Dellago> His character art has him being licked by a Demon
[0:52:00] <+mindgoblins> hexblade
[0:52:00] <snaggletusks> lae'zel's hair!!
[0:52:00] <%vaderxyz1970> Hell yeH

[0:52:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS NEGA PAT
[0:52:01] <%MechArch> wearing the same outfit my dude
[0:52:02] <@SoFarFetched> YOU'RE BOTH WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT
[0:52:02] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt you literally saw him make out with a demon on loading screens
[0:52:04] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt HE STOLE YOUR BIT
[0:52:04] <+orion_248> It's time for trouble. And make it double

[0:52:06] <%W1nterTitan> Pact of the blade
[0:52:06] <dinnydanny777> He used a sword though
[0:52:06] <Teras_ode> hold up
[0:52:07] <wraithtaker162> He's a paladin with worse branding
[0:52:08] <ergulor> because you're better
[0:52:08] <+Merhabi> YOU SECRETLY PICKED THE GOOD OPTION HE LIKED
[0:52:08] <butthurtdave> Different subclass?

[0:52:22] <+Kitafin> Warlock friend
[0:52:22] <%Frost_Quill> Level him up.
[0:52:25] <%MechArch> one of you is gonna have to change
[0:52:26] <%chiazam> He's a on-hit warlock vs spells
[0:52:26] <Dao_Puppy> Cuz he's a shitlock
[0:52:27] <+Kyma1020> gotta level up
[0:52:27] <%juxtest> Hes just a Skirmishlock now
[0:52:28] <jorniev> WAIT THEN WHY WAS HE TALKING SHIT BACK THERE!?
[0:52:29] <+clov_a> ohhh hexblade
[0:52:31] <Sulliman34> @dinnydanny777 spellsword is elf wizard exclusive
[0:52:34] <Decarcassor> He is not Hexblade. Its not in the game
[0:52:35] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[0:52:37] <butthurtdave> double eldritch blast
[0:52:41] <+Merhabi> DEFAULT
[0:52:42] <+GenesisKnight> Repelling blast is good
[0:52:42] <%chiazam> PICK WHATEVER YOU DON'T HAVE
[0:52:42] <Tuna_Can_0> stack one stat Kappa
[0:52:46] <%dasmause> hes not a hexblade what are you people talking about
[0:52:46] <%Frost_Quill> ALL WARLOCK PARTY
[0:52:46] <M0untain_wolf> Now its time for GOBLIN SLAYIN
[0:52:47] <+Kitafin> Punch/swing warlock
[0:52:49] <wraithtaker162> Armor of Agathys is good
[0:52:51] <%heyitsbrian> The Fiend? but goes melee?
[0:52:51] <BlkFlameKami> @jorniev because he fucking hates his patron
[0:52:52] <+pectusumbra> Ah, he's to the fiend at least for now
[0:52:52] <%heyitsbrian> weird
[0:52:53] <%SABiscotti> always agonizing blast
[0:52:53] <jorniev> DOUBLE HEX
[0:52:58] <+Merhabi> Make him talk to animals
[0:52:58] <aeonicvector> Stat him like a fighter, he's a melee warlock
[0:52:59] <+maximumcrit> keep agonizing blast, eldritch blast is a warlocks bread n butter
[0:53:01] <%heartlesshealer> Just give him different spells from yours aside from that blasty bolt
[0:53:03] <%NeoCre> @jorniev He was speaking from experience
[0:53:09] <Decarcassor> Alays pick Hex !
[0:53:12] <zmuno> Melee Warlock
[0:53:15] <Sulliman34> armor of agathys would be real good
[0:53:16] <$raziel391> HEX
[0:53:17] <fearjunkie> HELLISH REBUKE
[0:53:24] <cheapdoc> burning hands is pretty good aoe
[0:53:26] <tanarath> Hex
[0:53:28] <%zibibberoonie> WITCH BOLT
[0:53:28] <%strugglepunk2> i love it when characters play outside of their class- like wyll being a chad "yo, glory and heroism is pretty sick actually" and not like some schemer
[0:53:29] <Decarcassor> Hex is a must have for Warlocks
[0:53:29] <wraithtaker162> hellish rebuke is just Free Damage
[0:53:30] <%Treuan> Burnie Handers
[0:53:30] <butthurtdave> Are you gonna frontline him or backline?
[0:53:35] <+pectusumbra> if he's a frontline rebuke or armor of A, yeah
[0:53:36] <+Merhabi> Just look at his stat spread
[0:53:36] <wraithtaker162> doesn't even cost a bonus action to csat
[0:53:38] <Decarcassor> Also Wyll isn't a melee fight er at all !
[0:53:41] <+clov_a> bernie handers
[0:53:51] <Xelgus> 5 fates sucks, it's just another spell
[0:53:52] <AnalHaggar> that's a potent boy right there, has some real scumbigliant energies to 'im
[0:53:54] <snaggletusks> level the man
[0:53:59] <jacknerik> Ag-Ah-Thist
[0:54:01] <%Broand> he does on his character sheet
[0:54:03] <+pectusumbra> wait, he's not? That's weird
[0:54:05] <$raziel391> replace
[0:54:07] <Sulliman34> false life is free hp
[0:54:24] <Sulliman34> he doesnt have armor prepared
[0:54:30] <%Ne1son> Devils sight is actually pretty good
[0:54:32] <%heartlesshealer> so then that means give him a hellish rebuke or false life
[0:54:33] <butthurtdave> Are you gonna have him as a melee or a ranged unit tho
[0:54:34] <%Ne1son> since hes a human
[0:54:35] <+GenesisKnight> False life is good for him
[0:54:37] <%rdark_ksu> armor of a bathmodad
[0:54:37] <+WheatlyXT> Pretty sure Wyll already knows Armor of Agathys
[0:54:42] <Sulliman34> yeah devils sight on a human
[0:54:43] <zecht89> devil's sight is the best
[0:54:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> the warlock outfit is pretty cool
[0:54:49] <Decarcassor> He makes a terrible melee character
[0:54:50] <fearjunkie> noooooooo get devil's sight
[0:54:51] <%strugglepunk2> maybe beast speech?
[0:54:54] <+pectusumbra> Yeah, he's clearly MEANT to be a hexblade warlock, I fully expect him to get changed later
[0:54:58] <cheapdoc> he's got 9 str, melee would be unwise
[0:54:59] <Decarcassor> Because the melee optiosn for Warlock aren't in the game yet
[0:55:00] <+WheatlyXT> You have Arm of Hadar so you don’t really need burning hands
[0:55:00] <M0untain_wolf> his eye
[0:55:01] <%strugglepunk2> Druids all over the place and such
[0:55:04] <+WheatlyXT> They’re both aoe
[0:55:06] <%heartlesshealer> he picked the sight for darkvision it's fine
[0:55:16] <wraithtaker162> Misty Step Is Incredible
[0:55:17] <butthurtdave> Hex?
[0:55:19] <Sulliman34> hex good
[0:55:20] <tanarath> hex
[0:55:23] <%heartlesshealer> either bolt or rebuke
[0:55:27] <%chiazam> hellish rebuke or hex?
[0:55:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is your whole crew infected?
[0:55:29] <%heartlesshealer> rebuke is a revenge spell
[0:55:29] <%zibibberoonie> WITCHBOLT
[0:55:31] <+pectusumbra> actually check his gear, does he have a dex weapon or something
[0:55:32] <cheapdoc> no it doesn't, armor of hadar is armor, burning hands is a cone
[0:55:32] <fearjunkie> his dexterity's alright
[0:55:33] <Xelgus> witchbolt is damage every turn
[0:55:34] <Sulliman34> oh fuck yeah misty step
[0:55:36] <+GenesisKnight> Teleport
[0:55:38] <butthurtdave> Is there respec in this build of the game?
[0:55:38] <%Ne1son> Witch bolt is a TRAP
[0:55:40] <wraithtaker162> Bonus Action Teleport
[0:55:41] <+WheatlyXT> I’m sad only Pact of the Chain is in. :(
[0:55:43] <Sulliman34> misty is the ultimate gtfo move
[0:55:44] <fearjunkie> KEEP MISTY STEP
[0:55:50] <fearjunkie> misty step fucking rules
[0:56:00] <tannu_tuva> his coat is pretty clutch ngl
[0:56:02] <+pectusumbra> @WheatlyXT more stuff is going to be added later
[0:56:12] <scrublord009> STOP JOJO POSING
[0:56:19] <+Solutha> warlocks are just magic guns
[0:56:21] <%heartlesshealer> pat he needs levels
[0:56:23] <%Calek> Warlock always cast at the highest level
[0:56:24] <Xelgus> it's a warlock thing
[0:56:24] <wraithtaker162> all warlock spells cast at their highest level
[0:56:27] <tannu_tuva> AY YA YA YA YA
[0:56:32] <+Faultlined> Warlocks always cast their spells at their highest level
[0:56:35] <+ohyouthot> melee pact of the chain bad
[0:56:35] <cheapdoc> normal, same as you, warlocks can only cast with their highest level spellslot
[0:56:36] <+cherryceecee> i have a feeling this game's gonna be in early access for atleast a year
[0:56:42] <%AgniBrandt> All warlock spells cast at the highest available level
[0:56:43] <Sulliman34> warlocks always upcast, its nice
[0:56:44] <+WheatlyXT> Warlocks only cast at their highest level.
[0:56:45] <Decarcassor> Warlocks are weird
[0:56:45] <+GenesisKnight> All warlock spells are at their highest level. But they only get like 5 slots max.
[0:56:46] <%MonsterEnvy> This guy is for sure supposed to be a Pact of the Blade Warlock in the full game
[0:56:46] <%zibibberoonie> Warlocks have cantrips instead of spells
[0:56:47] <%Calek> but they get their spells back on a short rest
[0:56:51] <+WheatlyXT> It’s the same for your main character
[0:56:52] <zecht89> warlock is basically a mage ranger
[0:56:52] <+pectusumbra> yeah, warlocks have a small amount of spells, but they refresh often and cast at the highest level
[0:56:55] <%MisterTylerrr> Wouldn't it be kinda fucked if the BRain Bug's got stronger when more of themselves are nearby, so keeping a team of infected broes fucks you in the end.
[0:56:58] <%AgniBrandt> And you only get a couple spells, but they come back on a short rest unlike any other caster
[0:57:00] <fearjunkie> yeah, it makes up for the fact that they have VERY FEW slots to work with
[0:57:01] <sendart> less spells but always big
[0:57:06] <wraithtaker162> Makes their spellcasting real juicy, but you don't get enough spell slots to spam it
[0:57:06] <aeonicvector> They are also the only casters who get ALL back on SR
[0:57:07] <%heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail
[0:57:08] <Sulliman34> i feel like warlocks will be strong in this game when a DM cant tell you "noooo you cant short rest"
[0:57:10] <%MonsterEnvy> Wana bring out his Familar
[0:57:13] <%weissguard> psaBig psaDogchamp
[0:57:16] <%FallenAngelZelos> Warlocks are weirdos
[0:57:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Zangief a big booooi
[0:57:17] <+WheatlyXT> Warlocks are also the only class to get their slots back on a short rest
[0:57:21] <BlkFlameKami> bone apple tea
[0:57:28] <fearjunkie> Zangief, Level 20 Goodest Boy
[0:57:31] <%Meekest> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[0:57:32] <+D00msDayDan> SHOW FAT
[0:57:33] <%heartlesshealer> no crab, but this is fine
[0:57:34] <+razielhex> Twimps
[0:57:37] <+ohyouthot> @Sulliman34 short rest is once per long rest
[0:57:37] <%zibibberoonie> sIMP
[0:57:39] <%Ne1son> Osteoporosis
[0:57:39] <wraithtaker162> But you see, @Sulliman34 , the game does stop you from short resting in certain areas
[0:57:44] <WillofGame> Sequel to Moon Gang
[0:57:48] <wraithtaker162> and it'll even stop you from long resting in those areas
[0:57:50] <jacknerik> Warlocks always cast at highest level and have fewer than any other main caster class, but they recharge on a short rest
[0:57:51] <viciousgrim> does she do that voice every time she talks to the dog?
[0:57:52] <+pectusumbra> eehhhh, the problem is his str is actually bad
[0:57:53] <fearjunkie> I thought this was Baldurs Gate, not Megami Tensei
[0:57:53] <%MisterTylerrr> 2 Imps on screen, and one Imp streaming the game.
[0:57:56] <%zibibberoonie> He has low strength
[0:57:57] <+razielhex> sImp Gang
[0:57:57] <fearjunkie> all this summoning shit
[0:57:58] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt His Strenght is bad the Rapier is better for him with his dex
[0:57:59] <+WheatlyXT> The imp is such a better option than the Quasit
[0:58:00] <%Meekest> Is her ponytail ok
[0:58:02] <Sulliman34> @Sulliman34 oh REALLY thats interesting, good balance, surprised they removed hit dice
[0:58:02] <$RealThiele> more dice can win, orks approve
[0:58:09] <%Ne1son> No his dex is way better than his str pat
[0:58:12] <aeonicvector> Finesse
[0:58:12] <+WheatlyXT> He’s not good with str weapon tho
[0:58:13] <TCDerps> finesse = dex
[0:58:14] <Samus37> finesse is dex
[0:58:14] <Xelgus> FINESSE
[0:58:15] <+tinypouf> where did astarion go
[0:58:15] <%Calek> Two-Handed weapons use strength
[0:58:15] <QuipSan> finesse
[0:58:16] <+maximumcrit> its a finesse weapon = dex
[0:58:17] <%heartlesshealer> which one what?
[0:58:17] <+GenesisKnight> Finesse
[0:58:18] <thethickness68> finesse is for dex melee
[0:58:18] <+Solutha> you want a finese wep
[0:58:18] <Nyemmers> whoa the twitch extension is pretty cool
[0:58:19] <aeonicvector> Finesse = DEX
[0:58:19] <@commanderclaw> Finess lets them use dex
[0:58:19] <Decarcassor> His strenght does not matter all. But his dex suck too.
[0:58:19] <%zibibberoonie> Finesse
[0:58:20] <prime_name> Finesse tag
[0:58:21] <wraithtaker162> Finesse tag
[0:58:21] <+razielhex> I like how the cleric is the tank
[0:58:21] <%aslfrasle> Strength unless it says finesses
[0:58:23] <%VioletHeart> If it says finesse it'll use whichever is higher of Str or Dex. If it doesn't it'll use Str.
[0:58:24] <%Ne1son> Finesse
[0:58:25] <%heartlesshealer> elaborate question
[0:58:25] <+Merhabi> Finesse
[0:58:26] <$raziel391> Finesse
[0:58:27] <%Sycada> dat hair is possessed
[0:58:28] <%chiazam> Finesse = dex
[0:58:29] <+pectusumbra> Finesse means dex or str, whichever
[0:58:31] <jacknerik> If it says Finesse it can be used by either strength or dex
[0:58:32] <tubit> Lae'zel's hair's freaking out
[0:58:33] <Decarcassor> His dex is still pretty bad.
[0:58:34] <+WheatlyXT> Finesse
[0:58:35] <Thewoodentree> FUCKIN LAZELS HAIR
[0:58:35] <trianglehat> Lae's hair is freaking out
[0:58:36] <%heartlesshealer> Finesse works off of DEX
[0:58:37] <%Jeemukun> lookit that braid go
[0:58:42] <fearjunkie> at this point we're just explaining 5e to Pat
[0:58:48] <%hahaha1171> pat the guy
[0:58:48] <zecht89> and light means it can be equipped on the off hand
[0:58:50] <Sulliman34> i havent seen ANYONE play monk yet, i wonder how it translated
[0:58:50] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt hey Pat, idk anything about Baldur's Gate or DnD in general, but I like rpgs, you think I'd like this game?
[0:58:51] <wraithtaker162> Lae'zel's hair is goin wild and crazy
[0:58:53] <%heartlesshealer> weapon trait tags are good
[0:58:56] <Xelgus> they could definitely stand to add some tutorials
[0:59:00] <fearjunkie> NANI
[0:59:01] <%zibibberoonie> OH YEAH
[0:59:01] <@commanderclaw> Paige wants to know your location
[0:59:02] <Thewoodentree> I wip my sowrd back and forth
[0:59:02] <%heartlesshealer> umm???

[1:18:15] <s1rcuit> I know nothing about Baldur's Gate or Dnd, but like rpg, would I like this game?
[1:18:15] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt press space to force turn based mode
[1:18:16] <+TamJamming> LUL
[1:18:18] <+Tyonidus> LOL
[1:18:18] <%Piemen99> pssf
[1:18:23] <%Dakuu75> how long was the Hide cooldown?
[1:18:24] <Thewoodentree> Time spell
[1:18:28] <Oncamimus> who is Wyll?
[1:18:29] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Shadowheart has stealth boosting powers
[1:18:31] <fearjunkie> BITES ZA DUSTO
[1:18:32] <zecht89> you can stack items infront of the guard
[1:18:34] <+baka_sugoi> stinky bby
[1:18:36] <%MonsterEnvy> you should have used those
[1:18:37] <+vaultzombie> God that dog is so cute it should be illegal
[1:18:43] <%rdark_ksu> @TrollKing96 its one of the few places that are actually a city. More people more money more opportunity blah blah
[1:18:45] <+MarxNoJutsu> I thought you stay hidden until someone sees you
[1:18:52] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Why does everyone want to go to Baldurs Gate?
[1:18:53] <ScreamLord> I just got McDonalds for the first time a a long while and I even had it delivered to me. I blame Paige for this
[1:18:54] <Oncamimus> love good boy gief
[1:18:57] <rektasaurus_rekts> what kind of dog is it?
[1:18:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat crouching down in front of a security guard before shoplifting, chuckling "You can't see me, stupid."
[1:19:01] <+MarxNoJutsu> you just can't hide while in their vision cone
[1:19:01] <tannu_tuva> what a great story
[1:19:02] <tubit> cool story pat
[1:19:04] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt i love you
[1:19:05] <zashrin777> amazing story
[1:19:09] <%YakumoYomi> Great interaction
[1:19:12] <CappuccinoGuil> "Old man says the truth" more at 11
[1:19:15] <haitakaa> but the veerus
[1:19:18] <Samaugsch2> @decarcassor Are halflings an option in this game?
[1:19:22] <snaggletusks> yes maam sorry maam...
[1:19:22] <zecht89> @rektasaurus_rekts brittish bulldog i think
[1:19:23] <cosmicgoatee> Descent into Avernus involved saving the city of Elturel yes. It also involved the first layer of the 9 hells a sick fallen angel warrior and mad max road warrior shit
[1:19:27] <JonEWorldbeater> So, I admit to being a filthy casual, but does Early Access just mean 'This game is basically finished, but it's bugged up the ass, so we're actually gonna fix that before we charge full price'?
[1:19:32] <+Tyonidus> I love Lae/zel I believe I can soften her up and spread them Githyanki cheeks boys
[1:19:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> must do snek
[1:19:35] <$joylent_blue> Samaugsch2 yeh
[1:19:37] <%Jaller101514> Jaller101514 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! In the same vein as having only the evil companions for data purposes, I wonder what that "communal player character" would look like if the devs removed the "white skin" option...
[1:19:37] <DSD24> Don't you need to separate your team?
[1:19:42] <BenLanBen> doncha have to separate her from party? otherwise she'll leave convo to follow ya
[1:19:45] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Have Shadow Heart use her stealth boosing powers
[1:19:45] <Decarcassor> @Samaugsch2 Yes
[1:19:49] <+tutsabutz> break her from the party
[1:19:53] <+MarxNoJutsu> early access in this case means very extensive demo
[1:19:54] <%MonsterEnvy> You need to seperate your team
[1:19:59] <$joylent_blue> JonEWorldbeater this game is both very unfinished AND bugged up the ass lol
[1:20:11] <+OmegaWeltall> NotLikeThis split the party
[1:20:12] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt , why are you wearing that ugly helmet? shouldn't the accurate Pat hair always be on full display?
[1:20:21] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You need to split the party
[1:20:21] <%Parapattern> I like how Zee is looking straight at the screen
[1:20:34] <+JetQuills> that's three, time to make it a meme
[1:20:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Then they can do stuff independently.
[1:20:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Awww baby pupper strem
[1:21:03] <+MarxNoJutsu> @joneworldbeater There's a good chunk of story but its far from finished
[1:21:06] <%barkon345> @JonEWorldbeater in this games case it is more like we are lettign you pr order the game a year early and as a pre order bounus you can check out what we have finished so far and help us bug test it.
[1:21:13] <%rdark_ksu> its blood
[1:21:21] <theanora1> Geif being on stream feels like when you have to train your replacement at work
[1:21:28] <+MarxNoJutsu> what is available is great though
[1:21:31] <tubit> Best girl
[1:21:54] <%NeoCre> @joneworldbeater Oh GOD no, this game not only has a crap ton of bugs, only around 15% is available, only half the classes and races are implemented, and saves WILL be deleted multiple times before completion. This is for people that want a taste early/want to mess around while it’s being worked on
[1:21:58] <BlkFlameKami> tfw no tiefling gf
[1:22:00] <SaltyAzteca> SSSSASSSS
[1:22:01] <%barkon345> yea what is hear shows tones of potential but it is no where near finished

[1:22:47] <SmortyPuffin> was she flirting with me?
[1:22:48] <%ClericOfSparda> Curse your character's debilitating gambling habit!
[1:22:48] <St_Burke> she took advantage of the early access
[1:22:51] <+MarxNoJutsu> @neocre 15%?! I've sunk like 18 hours into this game how much longer is it gonna be?!
[1:22:59] <%Agami23> hey pat, just got in late. hows the gate? is it balders yet?
[1:23:04] <KaitlynnHere> I can’t wait until zangeif gets full sized
[1:23:06] <JonEWorldbeater> Cool, 'cuz I was gonna say, this pretty much seems like what most AAA publishers would put out as a finished product, so just wanted to know how low the bar was
[1:23:10] <Samaugsch2> Fuck all the devils
[1:23:17] <%zibibberoonie> Jump is very finicky
[1:23:19] <dinnydanny777> Wow, your party member seems to have your race
[1:23:21] <tubit> The jumping system is super finicky
[1:23:22] <%Dakuu75> can you stand on that marble columb then jump off it?
[1:23:23] <dinnydanny777> hate*
[1:23:29] <St_Burke> : O
[1:23:30] <%barkon345> @MarxNoJutsu expect this game to have a couple of hundred hours of gameplay
[1:23:32] <+Solutha> jump is so bad, and unbalanced in combat

[1:24:01] <KaiserMario> HOROSHO
[1:24:09] <Samaugsch2> @barkon345 Wow. This game might be worth $60 then
[1:24:11] <tubit> You basically have to go pixel hunting to make the jumps
[1:24:12] <zashrin777> fat boi fat boi stinky stinky fat boi

[1:25:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hes gonna die
[1:25:36] <%Meekest> Ok
[1:25:37] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Why is Baldurs Gate important?
[1:25:42] <Decarcassor> I think if you play some races that don't live in Baldur's gate you get different option. Like Lolth Sworn Drows
[1:25:47] <%zibibberoonie> Character origin is the first option at creation, but none are implemented yet
[1:25:47] <@SoFarFetched> does this confirm they fuck fight?
[1:25:49] <erknen> seal letter, take identity
[1:25:54] <+pectusumbra> Look at this nerd working hard instead of getting a tentacle sugar daddy
[1:25:58] <%VioletHeart> Baldur's Gate is pretty fucky.

[1:26:04] <UrsaDoom> Baldurs Gate is important in the same way New York is important.
[1:26:06] <$joylent_blue> dude's jaw is TOO STRONG
[1:26:08] <erknen> baldurs gate is the new jersey of Faerun

[1:27:04] <tubit> Granma's getting stiff in her old age
[1:27:04] <theanora1> that hammer
[1:27:20] <%IminyourBase> hammer stuck to hand
[1:27:21] <+MarxNoJutsu> The full game is gonna let me smash Shadowheart, right?
[1:27:24] <%Taisuru> Every smith is the best smith when you're talking to them :V
[1:27:24] <%luketrapwalker> HE SAID IT
[1:27:26] <dinnydanny777> Did he say Neverwinter? :O
[1:27:26] <erknen> black smith lookin handsome
[1:27:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A reference to Neverwinter? Are all these games in the same universe?
[1:27:38] <JonEWorldbeater> Very bishi hornman
[1:27:38] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Your dude looks like a huge doofus with that helmet on LUL
[1:27:39] <%Livelinne> Himbo??? clempsPog
[1:27:40] <%YakumoYomi> I'd love for Larian to say "Nah, that was intentional. Granny NOT reaching for hugs is a bug, though"
[1:27:40] <dinnydanny777> He said Neverwinter limesO
[1:27:41] <%Dakuu75> wait so, what happened to these folks? did they not always look like demons, or something?
[1:27:45] <tuskntemper> Yes, they are

[1:27:59] <Dellago> Oooh, Glaive
[1:28:00] <%ClericOfSparda> F- Yeah +1!
[1:28:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Taisuru Kewl
[1:28:05] <BenLanBen> have ya been to sunken flagon fellow thiefling
[1:28:10] <digaogrunge> @PatStaresAt Sell stuff using your highest Charisma char for bigger profits
[1:28:16] <%MonsterEnvy> Laezel could have
[1:28:18] <%VioletHeart> @Dakuu75 They did, but after some devil fuckery lately everyone's skeptical of everyone with fiendish ancestry, so a lot of tieflings got kicked out of their homes.
[1:28:18] <erknen> neverwinter, balders gate, waters deep, all are located in Faerun
[1:28:19] <tannu_tuva> can gale eat the gloves
[1:28:19] <+MarxNoJutsu> @dakuu75 They're Tieflings, so they're like descendants of demons
[1:28:20] <zecht89> it's for later pat
[1:28:20] <%MonsterEnvy> I think
[1:28:26] <%Agami23> now is that a light hammer or a light aspected hammer?
[1:28:30] <digaogrunge> YEP
[1:28:30] <zashrin777> the boi snores

[1:28:45] <+Solutha> gloves become an option later
[1:28:50] <%MonsterEnvy> I remember this guy selling a Greatswrod when I played
[1:28:50] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:28:56] <Samaugsch2> @dakuu75 An ancestor of theirs made a pact with an arch devil
[1:28:59] <JonEWorldbeater> Put snoring boi on mic
[1:29:00] <+MarxNoJutsu> You can throw basically everyone and everything in this game
[1:29:02] <%Dakuu75> @VioletHeart @MarxNoJutsu OH-wow. so LITERAL racism, lol. damn.
[1:29:03] <+MarxNoJutsu> and its amazing
[1:29:03] <%zibibberoonie> Throw the child
[1:29:17] <%Dakuu75> @Samaugsch2 ah-gotchya
[1:29:26] <mr_slaide> Armoire
[1:29:27] <danpc5> Pat, throw a child
[1:29:27] <JonEWorldbeater> Very nice armoire
[1:29:32] <%barkon345> I just notices the creepy ass head i the backround
[1:29:33] <T_Sasquatch> !Uptime
[1:29:33] <mr_slaide> No.
[1:29:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 29m.
[1:29:35] <+MarxNoJutsu> yeah the Druids are straight up dick heads in this game
[1:29:37] <Decarcassor> Not as a warlock
[1:29:38] <digaogrunge> Warlocks wear light armor only
[1:29:41] <%heartlesshealer> hell no. chain shirts are never warlock
[1:29:43] <Them00n> No
[1:29:48] <fearjunkie> get the crosbow
[1:30:11] <digaogrunge> You got Eldritch Blast? You're good
[1:30:15] <%rdark_ksu> its +1
[1:30:16] <%ClericOfSparda> That's not bad tho
[1:30:18] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt This is strange I remember this guy sellinga Greatsword when I played
[1:30:19] <%heartlesshealer> if you can get the ammo for it too, then it's a nice ranged physical for your warlock new man
[1:30:21] <+MarxNoJutsu> Druids are proficient in nature and racism
[1:30:24] <fearjunkie> +1 weapons are magical
[1:30:26] <%zibibberoonie> Reminder, crossbow can't benefit from the extra attack ability
[1:30:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Wait I think I see the Greatsword
[1:30:31] <%NeoCre> Crossbow is str based
[1:30:33] <Decarcassor> It show you the proficie y of the currently talking character, not the character who's inventory you are looking at. as fighter Lae'zel can equip any weapon or armor
[1:30:34] <fearjunkie> there are enemies who resist attacks from nonmagic weapons
[1:30:36] <%VioletHeart> If it's anything like the tabletop then your trickery cleric'd do well with a crossbow, but seems like she's your tank currently so maybe not.
[1:30:38] <mr_slaide> Do't get crossbow, you already ot ranged.
[1:30:45] <Decarcassor> Also there is a human old woman by the cauldron where you got gruel. You should to talk to her. ;)
[1:30:49] <%Dakuu75> someone's on their period.
[1:30:49] <%heartlesshealer> oh no, crossbows are STR based in D&D?
[1:30:50] <Thewoodentree> I cant belive this bitchs name is Shadowheart cringe
[1:30:56] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL tail freaked out
[1:30:56] <%zibibberoonie> GARLIC!
[1:30:56] <Sol_Install> omg his tail was crazy
[1:30:56] <zashrin777> that tail
[1:30:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This town has no chill
[1:31:04] <+primax104> his tail just freaked out
[1:31:08] <fearjunkie> no theyre DEX
[1:31:10] <BenLanBen> have ya talk to local rat?
[1:31:17] <Them00n> She probably is too good for you.
[1:31:34] <%kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 37 whole months. Thanks for all the fun. Hopefully beating e8s (mostly) blind this weekend with the boys
[1:31:38] <Dellago> Pretty much all ranged weapons are dex, besides some throwing weapons like javelins
[1:31:44] <%zibibberoonie> Those feckin space frogs!
[1:31:50] <%heartlesshealer> more racism
[1:31:55] <tubit> Debatable
[1:32:01] <SomeAsianDood> Race card
[1:32:05] <Them00n> Fuck Githyanki though, for real.
[1:32:11] <%zibibberoonie> RACE PURITY!
[1:32:13] <JonEWorldbeater> @Thewoodentree Her real name is WyldStyle
[1:32:14] <tubit> I mean, she's not that cool
[1:32:17] <digaogrunge> Lae'zel doesnt understand the concept of sympathy
[1:32:18] <%Dakuu75> this bitch is SO AGRO, lol
[1:32:18] <%MonsterEnvy> You are next to the Jail from what I can see
[1:32:21] <Decarcassor> Asking for sympathy from a gith. lol.
[1:32:23] <+Solutha> She has no chill
[1:32:26] <tannu_tuva> the gith and their ethnic cleansing
[1:32:28] <+MarxNoJutsu> Laezal is just a bitch, but she's the only real tank so

[1:58:08] <+professormorrigan> about the worst that could've gone
[1:58:12] <Decarcassor> in D&D combat you never want to run in and end up in a bunched up mess. Spacing is key.

[1:59:17] <%MugenSandan> 5th edition is probably the most swingy and 50/50 version of d&d thus far
[1:59:31] <Decarcassor> The game is trying to teach you something about goblins here
[1:59:35] <DianaTheAscian> can u stop the trap?
[1:59:39] <+Solutha> Imagine telling ur dm I shoot eldtrich blast at the trap for 15 turns
[1:59:44] <%Cozy90> caman

[2:00:02] <%Parapattern> That's why they're great
[2:00:02] <DianaTheAscian> that seems to work
[2:00:03] <dinnydanny777> That they're super strong?
[2:00:07] <Jerp> they're Nott all bad
[2:00:07] <BaronVonProlix> Goblins are just fun gnomes
[2:00:08] <%MugenSandan> everything is either a cake walk or near impossible
[2:00:09] <zashrin777> wait, not like that
[2:00:13] <%bevyrage> wouldn't you be able to sneak through the trap's trigger?
[2:00:17] <Thewoodentree> It is time to end Goblin racism, they are the unsung heroes of the fantsy world
[2:00:20] <%Cozy90> Pat what if you were secertly a goblin?
[2:00:20] <+professormorrigan> we did it
[2:00:22] <DianaTheAscian> thank god
[2:00:23] <BaronVonProlix> @Jerp get out
[2:00:24] <%Nekros4442> Does Pat only have 1 melee guy? I can''t see the rest of his party

[2:01:20] <+mccf> DID SOME
[2:01:20] <M0untain_wolf> Worg maybe a bad encounter

[2:01:28] <M0untain_wolf> So its just GObs
[2:01:33] <tubit> I think because he went through the dialogue so fast, the worg didn't have time to run up
[2:01:40] <+Nemesisnick33> i wanna play this myself when its finished can you stop playing it and play something else so i can watch your stream FeelsBadMan
[2:01:41] <tonfirean> Can you ready actions in this?
[2:01:43] <jorniev> perception roll?
[2:01:44] <%bevyrage> DM dropped the worg on the table and rolled with it
[2:01:45] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Is it like DS where if you die too much enemies de spawn?
[2:01:46] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[2:01:49] <tubit> oh
[2:01:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You forgot to summon your Imps
[2:01:53] <+Solutha> worg is a ranger companion
[2:01:54] <+HellishDonkey> protct
[2:01:54] <Thewoodentree> nvm
[2:01:58] <%bevyrage> but then the party scum-saved and DM realized the worg wasn't suppose to be there
[2:01:58] <fearjunkie> oh that's BULLSHIT.
[2:02:18] <M0untain_wolf> AOPS

[2:03:37] <%bevyrage> tieflings are named as such because they've got a tertiary or more diluted connection to infernal blood in their family lineage

[2:04:21] <%Jekado> @deviljhojho_ also its pronouced like Tie-fling not thiefling
[2:04:22] <Them00n> Pat is bad at the video game once again
[2:04:24] <+professormorrigan> geez 2 imps
[2:04:27] <M0untain_wolf> once more Pat
[2:04:30] <snaggletusks> use hex, two warlocks, two hex, big times
[2:04:37] <%Dakuu75> @Gallhint yeah, one time Pat told gief to be cute, and he did it.
[2:04:38] <tubit> imps are op as fuck
[2:04:40] <JonEWorldbeater> Or just, y'know, play the game better
[2:04:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hide gobbo or she die
[2:04:54] <+professormorrigan> ye imps are ridic
[2:05:00] <%ClericOfSparda> Make her run as far back to the cave entrance as possible
[2:05:00] <%MonsterEnvy> The Imps have an action to fly
[2:05:04] <Samus37> Can you just have the goblin stealth in the back alone?
[2:05:21] <Decarcassor> If you listen closely, you can ear the DM asking "Are you sure ?" Ever since pat choose to free that goblin. :p
[2:05:25] <Daxalog> Dota worgs dont got shit on this.
[2:05:27] <%Nekros4442> he's doing fine. This game isnt meant to be something you can 100% without save scumming. Failure is supposed to be an intended part of the game
[2:05:32] <JonEWorldbeater> PROTIP: Standing in acid causes damage
[2:05:42] <Thewoodentree> lies
[2:05:48] <%MonsterEnvy> The Imps also fly instead of jump and can go pretty much anywhere
[2:05:59] <Decarcassor> @JonEWorldbeater Actualy no. It just reduce your AC
[2:06:00] <+professormorrigan> l m a o

[2:06:24] <%rdark_ksu> goota love the attack o opportunity
[2:06:24] <sendart> position your party before the fight nerd
[2:06:25] <Decarcassor> Its allmost as if freeing taht goblin was always a terrible idea no matter which way you go at it. :D
[2:06:25] <%Jekado> if you disengage it doesn't provoke but you can't attack
[2:06:25] <%Nekros4442> ...
[2:06:26] <@commanderclaw> Maybe go a different direction?
[2:06:29] <fearjunkie> this game is UNFAIR.
[2:06:29] <$LegendGHT> your dog fat

[2:06:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> I've seen cuter
[2:06:33] <%Nekros4442> Did Pat watch more Korone clips?
[2:06:33] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Fuck it, look up a walk through
[2:06:34] <JonEWorldbeater> So that's, what, 4 failures so far?
[2:06:35] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt You can use disengage to avoid AOOs
[2:06:35] <BaronVonProlix> its like 5E with your DM who is absolutely a dick
[2:06:37] <%Nekros4442> lol
[2:06:38] <theoverlordgopher> AoO is a sumbitch
[2:06:43] <mr_slaide> He exhausted!
[2:06:44] <Oncamimus> indeed
[2:06:45] <prime_name> This is the kind of encounter the DM gets mad at the players for not understanding the intended way.
[2:06:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> Thoughts on Bozja?
[2:06:47] <%Nekros4442> Korone exist Pat
[2:06:47] <%notgarza> Getting those Divinity 2 flashbacks

[2:06:57] <tubit> A lot of the time the hit rating goes way down because enemies are standing in shadows
[2:06:57] <KinduVborrd> Good boy
[2:06:58] <DianaTheAscian> maybe move her all the way back? @PatStaresAt
[2:06:59] <JonEWorldbeater> OH NO INDEPENDENCE DAY
[2:07:02] <%Cozy90> PAT TEACH ZENGIEF TO DO A LARIAT
[2:07:02] <zashrin777> lol game unfair, try different strategies
[2:07:03] <cosmicgoatee> LMAOOO
[2:07:08] <+razielhex> @Nekros4442 but isn't real
[2:07:09] <%BinaryFireball> How long until the Zangief Pat dynamic turns into Gorefield?
[2:07:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> My old shizu poodle mix is adorable!
[2:07:12] <zecht89> Me thinks gobbos will be playable
[2:07:18] <%NeoCre> Have her hide in the back
[2:07:20] <+professormorrigan> wat
[2:07:21] <M0untain_wolf> ya moved
[2:07:22] <Decarcassor> The game is very fair and very easy if you are familiar with D&D. Pat is just trying to push trough a very bad decision while not being super good at D&D. But it sure is entertaining. :p
[2:07:27] <Daxalog> Epic
[2:07:28] <%Nekros4442> Oh that's weird

[2:07:59] <DianaTheAscian> YES
[2:08:14] <Thewoodentree> thank god

[2:08:25] <Daxalog> Here we go
[2:08:29] <%MonsterEnvy> The imp can fly you can move faster with it
[2:08:30] <%Jekado> @Decarcassor part of the rng seems a bit borked is that due to an anti scum system in place?
[2:08:37] <+professormorrigan> its fine
[2:08:39] <%emperordread> Always focus the caster, the summons soak up too much damage
[2:08:42] <prime_name> oh well
[2:08:44] <+professormorrigan> talk to his ghost or smth
[2:08:48] <@commanderclaw> Just talk to his corpse, it'll be fine
[2:08:49] <%Nekros4442> @Jekado No...it's just RNG dude

[2:09:31] <BlkFlameKami> so sleepy
[2:09:32] <+professormorrigan> idk why they prioritize the downed guy in this encounter
[2:09:32] <%Cozy90> <3
[2:09:34] <Them00n> It has no effect on me.
[2:09:36] <%Nekros4442> @Jekado Dude, if you play DnD shit can happen
[2:09:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Just put keyboard on dog 4Head
[2:09:38] <+XxBTExX> that dog is such a baby

[2:10:06] <%Jekado> @Nekros4442 i play a lot it does happen i suppose just seems more common when you reload in this
[2:10:11] <JonEWorldbeater> Big needy Gief
[2:10:20] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt If you ever have a real kid you have to name him Zangief Junior
[2:10:23] <%NeoCre> @professormorrigan the downed guy is the head Druid they caught. They don’t want you getting him back
[2:10:30] <Daxalog> Oh no
[2:10:40] <zashrin777> hex can also be reapplied for free if you killed the target
[2:10:41] <digaogrunge> SELECT HEX PROPERLY
[2:10:43] <snaggletusks> uh oh
[2:10:46] <%Nekros4442> I mean you can keep thinking that. If you want. RNG is RNG
[2:10:58] <@SoFarFetched> Maybe because this game is "Early Access" Kappa
[2:11:01] <+Solutha> Hex is gud
[2:11:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ah, eldrich blast spam. Warlock gameplay in a nutshell
[2:11:14] <tubit> Pat, you can move way further with the imps if you use jump
[2:11:18] <+professormorrigan> @NeoCre I do wonder if the AI behaviour was designed with that particular narrative in mind. Is all I meant.
[2:11:20] <Tuna_Can_0> No :)
[2:11:23] <DianaTheAscian> lot of missing
[2:11:25] <%MonsterEnvy> Your forgetting about your dash move pat
[2:11:28] <%MonsterEnvy> The Imps can fly
[2:11:33] <%MonsterEnvy> You can fly the imps up
[2:11:40] <@commanderclaw> You came in the back door I think
[2:11:50] <%BinaryFireball> flimps
[2:11:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember, space out your gang
[2:11:54] <%Ne1son> hit em with a guiding bolt
[2:12:02] <%R3Roundabout> @Nekros4442 If you haven't noticed, this is a video game. Not a tabletop game. RNG is only as random as developers decide.
[2:12:04] <JonEWorldbeater> Sun is down
[2:12:24] <IndoorSitup> !uptime
[2:12:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 12m.
[2:12:29] <+Solutha> Pat use hex pls
[2:12:30] <+Fycadius> Hex doesn't affect saving throws Pat
[2:12:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @R3Roundabout and DMs can fudge rools
[2:13:08] <%Parapattern> ?
[2:13:10] <tubit> boom
[2:13:12] <+Solutha> oooo the imps get bonus on hex
[2:13:19] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt THe Imps Jump action is a fly you can have them fly up to the one up top.
[2:13:34] <+TheBitingIrish> Hey Pat, when do you plan on playing more Morta? Next WEdnesday?
[2:13:58] <+professormorrigan> imps are very balanced
[2:14:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's always nice watching the player improve and adapt in this strategy-type stuff
[2:14:03] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[2:14:07] <tubit> Clap
[2:14:12] <Tuna_Can_0> can you stack buffs before fights like in div 2?

[2:25:46] <JonEWorldbeater> bone party
[2:25:52] <Dellago> Gith are the ancestors of freaky test subjects made by MIndflayers I think
[2:25:52] <%Dakuu75> LET ME DO WHAT I WANT MOM, gees this bitch
[2:25:56] <LilacsandFreedom> I think you hit the second option by accident
[2:26:00] <BaronVonProlix> @Thewoodentree Githyanki

[2:26:15] <+professormorrigan> space orcs!
[2:26:18] <+Tyonidus> Man this game's little animations when you're in dialogue with characters look so good, it actually looks like movements and expressions real people would make, not just robotic stuff like older rpgs
[2:26:28] <Decarcassor> Yep. Gith live in the Astral Plane, where time does not pass. They don't to eat, drink or sleep in there. As a result when they are not raiding they get super bored. :D
[2:26:28] <zashrin777> was that a genuine complement?
[2:26:28] <%Nekros4442> YEYEYEYE
[2:26:29] <%BinaryFireball> in highschool I wanted to start a band called space elves

[2:26:51] <Thewoodentree> Get fucked Gale i guess
[2:26:51] <zecht89> so gith are in fact reptilian
[2:27:01] <%NeoCre> @sulliman34 They are descendants of humans taken as slaves by mindflayers and experimented on for thousands of years before breaking free. Goth yanks are space pirate assholes. Githrazi are chill space monks.
[2:27:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I thought they were amphibian
[2:27:21] <+professormorrigan> githzerai are cool. see: dak'kon
[2:27:21] <Sulliman34> oh fuck thats right. no wonder gith are playable in this one despite not being phb race, their connection to illithids is so important

[2:39:46] <Superblooms> yeah that makes sense.
[2:39:46] <@SoFarFetched> He's been talking about it while playing this
[2:39:50] <%Taisuru> @nuane Yes, he did some streams of it too
[2:39:52] <%Agami23> @Taisuru thats actually really good to know, those help alot

[2:40:15] <%Parapattern> What could it be?
[2:40:16] <@SoFarFetched> VAMPURR
[2:40:19] <+tinypouf> astarionnn
[2:40:21] <%Taisuru> @Agami23 For sure, been thinking about hitting them up myself

[2:40:45] <+professormorrigan> whats the CR for chupacabras?
[2:40:46] <%Dakuu75> chupacabra, lol
[2:40:49] <BaronVonProlix> @PatStaresAt so i failed that and every other Astarton check and my dude STILL has no idea
[2:40:51] <%Darren716> Its not really
[2:40:56] <$RealThiele> El Chupaneebrae
[2:41:02] <%Taisuru> Game is sweatin
[2:41:15] <%Foopoof> did they say when the full release will be out?
[2:41:17] <nuane> party location
[2:41:18] <+TheBitingIrish> More behind the wagon
[2:41:25] <+razielhex> every time is goblin time
[2:41:25] <%Dakuu75> oh yeah, where is the goblin camp? can we go there first?
[2:41:40] <Dellago> It'll be in early access for at least a year I imagine
[2:41:42] <$RealThiele> goblin camp is in his mind
[2:41:43] <+XxBTExX> go balls deep Pat
[2:41:45] <%ospreyworks> You Only Save Scum Once?
[2:41:49] <St_Burke> ya-loing
[2:41:54] <SomeAsianDood> Wait is pat ignoring his mind goblins?
[2:41:55] <@SoFarFetched> They said Baldur's gate 3 will be in Early access for 1 year,but unsure. They pretty much said "It will be ready when it's ready"
[2:41:58] <+professormorrigan> oilbear cave
[2:42:00] <+tinypouf> why is the game falling apart? looks fine to me
[2:42:05] <%Dakuu75> SAVE lol
[2:42:06] <JonEWorldbeater> Countdown to Pat dying horribly...
[2:42:10] <tubit> yolo :)
[2:42:16] <$RealThiele> give it freeedom
[2:42:24] <+XxBTExX> Owlbear or Manbearpig?
[2:42:26] <%Dakuu75> oh ffs... please save scum this. XD
[2:42:28] <Superblooms> my pc sweats even on med settings
[2:42:28] <%BoxNavy> kill that bitch
[2:42:29] <@SoFarFetched> so its possible this game COULD take 2 years to fully release depending.
[2:42:36] <%Dakuu75> I have SUCH a bad feeling about this
[2:42:48] <%ClericOfSparda> It's a trap!
[2:42:50] <+dmtjinni> cool game
[2:42:54] <@commanderclaw> I still haven't figured out this part
[2:43:01] <+professormorrigan> click the ground?
[2:43:01] <+XxBTExX> @SoFarFetched doubt it will take that long. At most 1 year and a few months
[2:43:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> zzzzZZZZzzz
[2:43:02] <zecht89> climb down
[2:43:04] <$RealThiele> booby trap
[2:43:29] <fearjunkie> DETECT THOTS
[2:43:31] <%BinaryFireball> would you ever stream bg1 & bg2?
[2:43:37] <+professormorrigan> ouch
[2:43:37] <+XxBTExX> lul
[2:43:46] <$RealThiele> those goblins lightin up as thot
[2:43:46] <$povertysenpai> i just got here did he trigger a trap
[2:43:48] <zashrin777> dispel magic?
[2:43:49] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt jump behind statue and look around
[2:43:50] <%ClericOfSparda> detect magic?
[2:43:52] <Scrub_Seeker> you can pick the chest itself up just fine
[2:43:53] <Goodvibes99508> knock?
[2:43:53] <@SoFarFetched> @XxBTExX well that's why I said it "could" not it "should" cause even they aren't sure. Seems they're playing by ear on how long it will take.
[2:43:56] <BaronVonProlix> @PatStaresAt you can pick it up and try and figure it out later
[2:43:59] <+cheddie_gibbs> Detect thots: Shadowheart lights up
[2:44:11] <fearjunkie> counterspell?
[2:44:18] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[2:44:18] <fearjunkie> dispel magic?
[2:44:24] <+XxBTExX> Pat's char is as blind as a fkn bat
[2:44:47] <Sokumotanaka> Id fuck that staute
[2:44:56] <+artschooltrash> Man I wish there was an out of combat party jump, takes forever jumping over super minor things
[2:45:10] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> thats cool
[2:45:13] <+professormorrigan> jumping is very tedious
[2:45:14] <Decarcassor> A priestess of Shar paryaing to Selune ? Yeah she does not like that
[2:45:17] <KoyaMusa> like real life huh
[2:45:30] <+XxBTExX> they should have a button that if they are linked they all jump behind you
[2:45:36] <+Solutha> jump is implemented so tediously
[2:45:39] <+professormorrigan> ? weird
[2:45:48] <%Ne1son> Read it
[2:45:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> or a least a group jump button
[2:45:50] <BlkFlameKami> he snore
[2:45:55] <%Nekros4442> Maybe dont make her read it?
[2:45:55] <Goodvibes99508> character fails jump check falls into chasm dies. game over
[2:45:58] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt SOMEONE OTHER THaN THE EVIL PRIEST AHS TO READ IT PAT
[2:45:59] <+ktothec99> man Wyll glitched out in my game and I cant even recruit him
[2:46:00] <%BinaryFireball> I think the tedious things are all because multiplayer
[2:46:00] <+professormorrigan> because she's a shar cleric?
[2:46:01] <%Nekros4442> SOmeone else?
[2:46:03] <+tinypouf> read it harder
[2:46:19] <+XxBTExX> Put your penis through the paper.
[2:46:22] <$RealThiele> they need some way to link movement to one party member
[2:46:28] <+professormorrigan> selune doesn't like shadowho :)
[2:46:36] <BaronVonProlix> shadowheart is like the character the edgy kid makes
[2:46:37] <Decarcassor> Selune and Shar hate each other
[2:46:37] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt more like she has very SPECIFIC beef with Selune
[2:46:43] <%rdark_ksu> shut up dumb priest
[2:46:43] <%BinaryFireball> selune and shar no go together
[2:46:45] <TuxedoNash> 2
[2:46:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wait, She's evil??
[2:46:48] <jorniev> what god does she follow?
[2:46:51] <%Nekros4442> Bitch you literally folow the evil god
[2:46:52] <%TheFabledAble> @Decarcassor SPOILER
[2:46:58] <+XxBTExX> Sun bitch bitching about Moon bitch
[2:46:58] <tubit> Hmmmm, sounds a bit biased...

[2:47:22] <Oncamimus> awww
[2:47:22] <$povertysenpai> baby
[2:47:24] <+dmtjinni> z boi
[2:47:24] <LilacsandFreedom> baby
[2:47:26] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> yo this twitch extension is rad
[2:47:27] <gustavozxd> pat follows gief the god of food
[2:47:31] <%Taisuru> Pig baby
[2:47:31] <%Dakuu75> HEY, Gief chokes on his spit JUST LIKE PAT
[2:47:31] <%TheFabledAble> darkness, secrets and loss, domains of death and trickery
[2:47:33] <%Broand> The heck is going on with that water in the background
[2:47:35] <%ospreyworks> Selune and Shar are sisters
[2:47:37] <TuxedoNash> bedtime
[2:47:37] <$RealThiele> melt boi
[2:47:38] <+cursedwithadhd> is he sucking air
[2:47:39] <%BubbaRands> babeh need slep
[2:47:40] <+XxBTExX> "Im going to put him to sleep." - Pat 2020
[2:47:40] <%Space_Pompadour> Space_Pompadour subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! lets go gamers
[2:47:42] <+dmtjinni> hold on
[2:47:47] <Sokumotanaka> Gief then puts pat to bed
[2:47:49] <+ZoltanBMagnus> vote for the dialogue you cannot see
[2:48:08] <Oncamimus> @Broand I second this
[2:48:15] <%YakumoYomi> ...and now it's gone. I missed my chance!
[2:48:47] <$RealThiele> making housing items in FF is so tedious
[2:49:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I know nothing of th current 5e DnD deities.... the sad part is that I play a Cleric
[2:49:13] <@SoFarFetched> all these graphic issues people are asking can be easily answered in two words: "Early Access"
[2:49:43] <Oncamimus> yeah
[2:49:49] <@SoFarFetched> Where you can enjoy the viewing of the nice bugs
[2:49:49] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:50:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The bugs add crunch, flavor, and protein
[2:50:22] <gustavozxd> these evil characters are too hot
[2:50:26] <+dmtjinni> i wish i had a pc that can run this game it so fun
[2:50:32] <Decarcassor> Even after EA, I would expect a bit of jank. Larian isn't exactly a triple A company.
[2:50:34] <gustavozxd> is that an evil perk?
[2:50:51] <gustavozxd> so you can be considered morally grey 🤔
[2:50:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> make all da characters ebul
[2:50:53] <%strugglepunk2> you mean morally grey
[2:51:01] <@SoFarFetched> Well the company did apparently suggest to play the evil route first in BG3
[2:51:32] <@SoFarFetched> But they don't like when you make your character John Simpleton Kappa
[2:51:45] <Decarcassor> The problem with many "evil" route is that they are very easy to mistake for the stupid route.
[2:52:06] <%NeoCre> Gotta love how that caged goblin instantly became morally grey
[2:52:20] <$RealThiele> well tbh a lot of evil people are stupid
[2:52:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Gobbos are thicc lil shortstacks, of course they are morally grey
[2:52:47] <Decarcassor> When in doubt, kill monsters and take their stuff. Thats how D&D was built. :p
[2:53:03] <%Broand> which is kind of meh tbh. Some folks just want to figure out the story as a clueless human because that's what they are
[2:53:33] <%Broand> It's the same feeling as not picking malkvian in vampire the masquerade bloodlines for your first playthrough
[2:53:49] <%NeoCre> @bane_kaikyo from what I’ve seen, that seems especially true in this game. They all seem much hotter than in the books
[2:53:51] <gustavozxd> oh god malkavian
[2:54:02] <$RealThiele> id also say older DnD treated humans with kid gloves, extra feat or non-wep profciency means that the momentum is for people to pick them
[2:54:03] <gustavozxd> I could barely read the dialogue choices as malk LUL
[2:54:27] <gustavozxd> and I couldn't understand a single thing the voices said, like I couldn't hear them correctly
[2:54:43] <zashrin777> nice, so you dont almost kill yourself on the underside of a counter again
[2:54:44] <BaronVonProlix> nice beetlejuice shirt
[2:54:52] <gustavozxd> LUL speed baby
[2:54:58] <%Taisuru> FOOD

[2:55:26] <Sokumotanaka> you really should get a place to put the cat food
[2:55:27] <%Broand> What is going on with that water though
[2:55:27] <gustavozxd> he's pretty fast for a fat dog

[3:06:28] <Thewoodentree> KILL THE BABY
[3:06:31] <Decarcassor> Owlbears are kinda boring in 5e. They just bag of HP with claws, sadly. Nothing special about them.
[3:06:34] <$RealThiele> ray of enfeeblement it needs disadvantage

[3:07:29] <%Broand> TKG
[3:07:29] <TheRunningManlet> Clerics suck in this game right now. They literally heal for less than a ground effect can deal in a single turn.+
[3:07:31] <+XxBTExX> nailed it
[3:07:35] <+Solutha> hex
[3:07:51] <tubit> delicious owlbear omelettes
[3:08:02] <Decarcassor> @TheRunningManlet Clerics are not meant to be healer in the MMO sense in D&D 5e.
[3:08:12] <+XxBTExX> you can throw whats in your inventory
[3:08:20] <%Parapattern> Arrow?
[3:08:22] <+dmtjinni> pato
[3:08:31] <$RealThiele> yea 5th ed did smart stuff by making healing potions non-magical and giving short rests
[3:08:35] <%emperordread> You can throw random garbage in your inventory or anything in the enviornment around 1m next to you (including squirrels)
[3:08:39] <%Nekros4442> @TheRunningManlet Clerics arent pure healers...They are Paladins with more flexibility
[3:08:40] <jellssssss20> Blood boi should just be hanging around and lapping it out of the huge puddles
[3:08:45] <+razielhex> omlette aux owlbears
[3:09:08] <BlkFlameKami> LUL
[3:09:09] <Decarcassor> @TheRunningManlet Also Cleric can be very powerfulls, but Shadowhearth in particular kinda suck because she has a lot of stats in the wrong places.
[3:09:12] <%BinaryFireball> not gonna lie I'm rooting for the owlbear
[3:09:13] <%OBrew> OBrew subscribed with Prime. 
[3:09:16] <TheRunningManlet> Idk they just seem bad. Even ignoring the healing it feels like they're buffs get interrupted too often.
[3:09:21] <%BinaryFireball> owlbears are dope
[3:09:33] <TheRunningManlet> Although yeah I have heard Shadowheart is just kind of shit.
