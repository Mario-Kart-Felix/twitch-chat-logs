[0:03:24] <%Monkeyweed21> honestly not getting all the strawberries means you should just set your house on fire @hearingthenseeing
[0:03:27] <AthenaAegis> The worst part is really finding them more than actually getting them.

[0:04:41] <MyNameIsRasus> celesteez nuts
[0:04:47] <%Ne1son> This is a strong goblin to try and defeat
[0:04:52] <%SovPho> Can I get a rundown of why Celeste has mind goblins? Never played it/payed any attention to it
[0:04:55] <%SharkMissile> Apologies for not asking this on a Paige stream, but does she have her own discord or is it part of Pat's?
[0:04:59] <%SovPho> paid*
[0:05:09] <%SovPho> payed?
[0:05:19] <%SharkMissile> @SovPho It has optional collectibles, if you don't get them you aren't a REAL GAMER (tm)
[0:05:33] <%Ne1son> @SovPho Hidden collectibles that are difficult to get and show on the score screen
[0:05:34] <%SharkMissile> The (Strawberries)

[0:09:40] <%bravebravesrobin> strawberries are shit; just eat multi-vitamins
[0:09:41] <$realm_forge> They have the highest sugar content of all the berries wtf
[0:09:42] <%RayReborne> Those strawberries can be a real bitch to get, i got maybe 10-12 total
[0:09:43] <%DSD24> Celeste is a fun game! Madeline is a nice gal

[0:09:52] <Tracazoid> So you imposed another rule in the act of ditching one
[0:09:53] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man, are all the strawberries avoidable?
[0:09:53] <Profmcstevie> Strawberries are such a weird part of Celeste
[0:09:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Can you angle the camera up a little bit so we can see Elmo at the top of his castle?
[0:09:53] <+Tredecian> what happens if you get one on accident?
[0:09:56] <@SoFarFetched> NOT collecting strawberries?
[0:09:56] <hearingthenseeing> Cancelled
[0:09:56] <%R3Roundabout> Isn't that just another rule you made for yourself?
[0:09:57] <moonmintparadise> What are the strawberries there for ?
[0:09:57] <Vyskus> what is the opposite of a goblin
[0:09:58] <+ekodrop> strawberries are meh so that's fine
[0:09:59] <%waltzqueen> that sounds like it might make a new goblin!
[0:10:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> 0% Strawberries feels like a form of reverse-completion that sates a different goblin
[0:10:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Binary Strawberry morailty state, either all the strawberries or none
[0:10:04] <Profmcstevie> Many moons
[0:10:05] <%AgniBrandt> Is... Is it possible to not get any strawberries?
[0:10:09] <%ToadKing> i don't remember if there's any strawbs that are literally like in your way and impossible to skip though
[0:10:14] <%FingaLights> Isn't that just a new Mind Goblin?
[0:10:15] <BigFingerRo> Oh wow
[0:10:18] <Shwepie> Avoiding berries is easy. I believe in you.
[0:10:22] <%g0atmeal> defeat the goblins with a stronger goblin
[0:10:26] <draca23> Strawberries are actually helping my 'covid' symptoms. (I'm vaccinated so symptoms are mild af)
[0:10:27] <%Dova573> General Patton is right
[0:10:33] <Profmcstevie> Strawberries do nothing, they are a collectible for people who like collectibles
[0:10:40] <%dankjerri> just go right
[0:10:45] <+badfleshboy> He better end up getting at least one so it’s not clean
[0:10:45] <BigFingerRo> aren't some of those impossible to get without the double jump?
[0:10:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I think, you should pick up just ONE strawberry, and skip the rest
[0:10:58] <%DSD24> They impress your fiends!
[0:11:03] <Profmcstevie> THEN WHY ARE THEY THERE
[0:11:04] <%DSD24> friends
[0:11:06] <%RayReborne> Minor ending cosmetic change
[0:11:16] <+rafaelba93> getting them is fun tho
[0:11:16] <Nootyman> those two mind goblins are gonna fight the third, secret mind boss goblin
[0:11:19] <BigFingerRo> I can't imagine the babby stomping and crying this prompted from you
[0:11:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> @dsd24 no you had it right the first time
[0:11:23] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:11:23] <hearingthenseeing> trolled
[0:11:27] <BreakersAweigh> @chrisplaysthing why would you kill him
[0:11:28] <Nootyman> the mind goblin that tells you to collect the ones you missed earlier
[0:11:29] <%Monkeyweed21> not really
[0:11:29] <%Zeikier> Pat felt as betrayed as tho he lost a long lost lover
[0:11:29] <%g0atmeal> you actually get a unique thing if you get 0
[0:11:29] <%JoshManVGH> You know what are great? Straberry gummies. Those little snackpacks. Delicious
[0:11:30] <@Ranryu692> yeah, that's fucked of the game to do
[0:11:32] <T_Sasquatch> This part you're kinda crazy but i get it
[0:11:40] <Lajong_z> or stop being a baby pat thats what i think
[0:11:40] <%Zeikier> see pat Celeste forgot to tell you cuz
[0:11:40] <%SharkMissile> 100% -ing Celeste is legit one of the only gaming feats I'm legitimately proud of
[0:11:41] <@SoFarFetched> " Strawberries: The amount of collected Strawberries also affect which ending the player will get in Epilogue." Kappa
[0:11:43] <EntropyArcade> well some of the collectables matter for final level
[0:11:45] <ミュウレ4242> celeste is for precision platforming nerds, but the story is cute.
[0:11:48] <marvel877> The game tells that to an AVERAGE MINDED person, Pat.
[0:11:49] <bahiti> so is sayonara wild hearts on the gobbo-list as well?
[0:11:50] <@ssjklyco> Will pat vomit today? Find out
[0:11:55] <%DSD24> @GalacticaPhanto The Fiends in SMT games are pretty fun to be around

[0:15:04] <dreadedcthulhu> it's not 4x
[0:15:05] <ToneBacas> i'd love to be good at RTS games. there seems to be a lot of fun to be had in the genre, but i'm generally trash
[0:15:06] <draca23> Acting like a typical bulldog
[0:15:08] <%darklordfodder> I started falling off of RTS games when I realized how bad the AI that kept beating me in Warcraft 3 was.
[0:15:09] <%strakillias> If RTS games trigger your goblins then Stellaris must be the final boss of Mind Goblins.
[0:15:09] <%Fooguwu> I feel like games like They Are Billions have replaced single player RTS games
[0:15:09] <%polothegreatest> inmmersive sim?
[0:15:10] <+rafaelba93> its half rts half 4x
[0:15:18] <SilverFaustX> grand strategy and rts

[0:15:31] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Why do RTS games feel so different from things like MMOs? Is it scale?
[0:15:41] <SilverFaustX> u should play crusader kings 3
[0:15:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> its realer time strategy
[0:15:45] <ToneBacas> minecraft?

[0:16:10] <%darklordfodder> I was doing really well in one WC3 game...then I realized that was only because the AI Night Elves had got trapped in their base(Night Elves don't destroy trees to harvest them)
[0:16:10] <+rafaelba93> they are kind of their own thing, but still rts i think

[0:24:16] <@Jekado> True mind goblins.... not finishing battle pass
[0:24:24] <JetpackMcQuack> There's probably a goblin faction in that game
[0:24:28] <$realm_forge> Pat MUST buy a bunch of loot boxes and NOT open them
[0:24:29] <+CheesesSliced> Goblins are lame
[0:24:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does Pat have Real Time Strategy goblins?
[0:24:32] <%Tarage> The most mind goblin: Not centering the camera.
[0:24:34] <%SWFanatic> Battlepass = Sunk Cost Fallacy
[0:24:36] <%monsieurfantastic> total goblin
[0:24:42] <%linSP> I’ve beaten every skaven campaign only, despite buying everyone
[0:24:44] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah that would be the next mind gobling,going back to games where he missed passes. which means more warframe streams Kappa
[0:24:48] <+queaks> Could play goblins as part of goblins

[0:33:14] <ToneBacas> it is mind goblin therapy. Pat is actively sand-bagging his goblin PogChamp
[0:33:14] <%Tarage> What if he accidentally gets one?
[0:33:14] <artificiallynatural> But the collectible is RIGHT THERE
[0:33:15] <@Spydurman> *matrix guy* HE'S DOING IT

[0:33:24] <%Zeikier> if pat gets a strawberry the terrorists win
[0:33:25] <slix3431> So I'm guessing Pat's OCD won't let him ignore a strawberry he misses?
[0:33:26] <%Ipsenscastle> BEGONE, STRAWBERRY

[0:33:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He's starting to believe!
[0:33:32] <The_Murray_Carp> should get 3 attempts for the real goblining
[0:33:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> the goblins are evolving into hobgoblins
[0:33:38] <cartakus> Pat is just enpowering another goblin
[0:33:41] <%SWFanatic> Stay awhile, and Listen
[0:33:42] <%notsoy> the idea that strawberries do literally nothing is extremely offensive to me
[0:33:42] <slix3431> Oh so no Strawberries for OCD boy?
[0:33:44] <%RayReborne> hes not progress, talk to him
[0:33:45] <AnthonyJMax> talk to man
[0:33:45] <+sanhiei> talk to him he is a nice man
[0:33:46] <%bugz_munny> Do not make eye contact with strawberries
[0:33:46] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt aren't you making not getting a strawberry another mindgoblin though
[0:33:46] <+mikesapartment> talk to him
[0:33:46] <%BoxNavy> oh no
[0:33:49] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:33:49] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT
[0:33:53] <+NickHatesSnow> @justcallmebobplease I was littrally thinking the same thing
[0:33:54] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> With the power of spite, Pat can overcome anything! EVEN HIMSELF!
[0:33:57] <ppangboi> sometimes to slay a goblin you need a bigger goblin
[0:33:57] <%g0atmeal> it's influencer man
[0:33:58] <EntropyArcade> i wonder how far he can go without using the climb button
[0:34:02] <+CheesesSliced> Pat is the Real Red Riding Hood
[0:34:04] <muddiestpath> the strawberries have wasps in them, you don't want them!
[0:34:07] <%SWFanatic> Bonfire LIT
[0:34:14] <%g0atmeal> i love his dialogue box
[0:34:23] <aura_00> theo the best boy
[0:34:24] <+CheesesSliced> Emphasis on red
[0:34:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @muddiestpath I thought that was figs?

[0:34:36] <gaminglink25> 4
[0:34:38] <thewrathofscience> 4
[0:34:39] <%RayReborne> .... i think
[0:34:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt keep talking
[0:34:50] <+mikesapartment> :)
[0:34:51] <the_sprankton> there's something ironic about Pat not being able to play this game due to mind goblins when the whole game is about mind goblins
[0:34:54] <gaminglink25> 5
[0:34:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:34:56] <thewrathofscience> 5

[0:35:37] <skeletonman9000> aceuhhDance nanaPogPog chrisRoll chrisPog chrisPls oroFast
[0:35:46] <muddiestpath> there are no berries, none

[0:35:53] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The leftovers of those delicious strawberries
[0:36:02] <+CheesesSliced> You must link the flame
[0:36:05] <ExpressNode> The talking almost reminds me of Okami
[0:36:05] <dreadedcthulhu> is that a real instagram page
[0:36:08] <dreadedcthulhu> i hope so

[0:36:43] <%GalacticaPhanto> TheoUnderStars is his actual IG and it's really cute
[0:36:45] <%TheWinged7> already strawberry missed
[0:36:50] <%g0atmeal> i wonder how far he'll get with only dash and wall jump
[0:36:52] <gaminglink25> 8
[0:36:53] <thewrathofscience> 8
[0:37:00] <%Cozy90> KILLIN IT
[0:37:12] <+CheesesSliced> I’m developing an OJ Simpson simulator. Any backers?
[0:37:14] <kikoeru_san> holy shit he's doing it
[0:37:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> how can this be?
[0:37:22] <gaminglink25> 9
[0:37:24] <thewrathofscience> 9
[0:37:25] <muddiestpath> nein
[0:37:25] <Ris_Eltrut> So will Pat just shrivel up and die if he collects a strawberry?
[0:37:27] <Zeif00> 9
[0:37:29] <Kaji04> Not very i think, the game will require him to hold onto one of those
[0:37:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You're doing it Pat!
[0:37:42] <%mr_sups> Oh no
[0:37:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis
[0:37:43] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin
[0:37:47] <TrollKing96> Did get all of Theo's dialogue?
[0:37:57] <%PartyFavors> That sounded like a whimper
[0:37:58] <marvel877> What's Pat going to do if he accidentally gets a strawberry?
[0:38:00] <gaminglink25> 10
[0:38:00] <aura_00> you can feel the pain in his eyes...
[0:38:00] <thewrathofscience> 10
[0:38:02] <Lajong_z> didnt he have 6 in previous save?
[0:38:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> their succulence taunts me
[0:38:05] <Zeif00> 10
[0:38:18] <hearingthenseeing> This run is triggering my own mind goblins
[0:38:27] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin 3
[0:38:31] <ppangboi> @hearingthenseeing same
[0:38:36] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin 4
[0:38:40] <%SWFanatic> FUCK YOU VITAMIN C
[0:38:41] <%BoxNavy> NO
[0:38:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> why do some of them have wings
[0:38:48] <+CheesesSliced> IT’S THE HABLINSG
[0:38:51] <%TheWinged7> psaGoblin 5 strawberries ah-haha
[0:38:54] <%MelBrooksKA> This no strawberry run?
[0:38:56] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt pat now you're goblining in the opposite direction
[0:38:59] <The_Legendairy> i feel like avoiding every one is just trading one goblin for another
[0:39:01] <Botman_R> Isn't just ignoring ALL the strawberries just invoking a different kind of goblin?
[0:39:04] <ppangboi> @aWanderingKaivo ones with wings will fly away if you jump in the room
[0:39:07] <Zeif00> MonkaS
[0:39:08] <%RayReborne> dude skipped the lift, hell yeah
[0:39:09] <Ris_Eltrut> @aWanderingKaivo they fly away if you dash
[0:39:12] <i_chevalier> Whats the point of the strawberries
[0:39:13] <@ssjklyco> Should rename the series "Pat triggers chats mind goblins"
[0:39:16] <%sporeian94> Pat isn't you being like "I'm gonna collect 0 strawberries" just another mind goblin form of "I'm gonna collect them all"?
[0:39:21] <gaminglink25> 11
[0:39:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah gotcha
[0:39:21] <thewrathofscience> 11
[0:39:25] <Vashido22> @i_chevalier optional challenge
[0:39:33] <Vyskus> yeah fuck them strawbrerries
[0:39:34] <gaminglink25> 12
[0:39:38] <thewrathofscience> 12
[0:39:44] <cartakus> Grab one, left one behind find your balance...Anakin
[0:39:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Has this become an allegory from running away from one’s own gay thoughts?
[0:40:04] <i_chevalier> @vashido22 So they arent important. i gotcha.
[0:40:05] <%SinnerEbru> see pat isnt this shit fun
[0:40:05] <%twohitgood> @ssjklyco let him figure it out on his own. it's his own strategy to approaching it.
[0:40:07] <Vashido22> probably
[0:40:07] <%TheWinged7> what?
[0:40:07] <%cvp5127> run away
[0:40:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What?
[0:40:09] <+izanagi22> More gender than sexual orientation?
[0:40:09] <+NickHatesSnow> LUL
[0:40:09] <$realm_forge> It’s the grave of pats mind goblins
[0:40:11] <Treasure_Vault> Trans thoughts!
[0:40:11] <the_sprankton> This right here is where Madelaine should have turned back
[0:40:13] <%SharkMissile> What
[0:40:15] <+Dumple_Roe> kinda
[0:40:15] <lucyucy> pat this is just a new goblin
[0:40:17] <JetpackMcQuack> i think you gotta figure that out for yourself
[0:40:19] <%Cozy90> THATS HOT
[0:40:20] <aura_00> i mean, if you want it t obe
[0:40:20] <%g0atmeal> it's an allegory for climbing a mountain
[0:40:21] <reonome> probably
[0:40:21] <marvel877> ...kinda.
[0:40:22] <+CheesesSliced> Pat makes this look like a Dark Souls LP
[0:40:23] <gaminglink25> More depression in general really
[0:40:23] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:40:24] <+disgruntledgruntle> Is this a blind playthrough?
[0:40:28] <%Agami23> no, but possibly running away from coming out to your parents
[0:40:28] <+tempestzephyr> yea
[0:40:30] <%linSP> you can’t catch me straight thoughts
[0:40:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why would I run away from cute butts?
[0:40:31] <moonmintparadise> nah, the game is about being trans, i think
[0:40:33] <$realm_forge> That’s me running from my financial woes
[0:40:34] <%cvp5127> like that family guy joke
[0:40:36] <+Kyma1020> Not gay but trans thoughts
[0:40:36] <%RayReborne> maybe, didnt get that vibe from this games other subtle messaging but sure
[0:40:36] <%zzNamttamzz> Can't catch ne gay thoughts psaDab
[0:40:39] <TongYueliang> Other way around. It's an allegory for climbing the insurmountable wall that is self acceptance
[0:40:41] <%twistedj3ster> I thought that was Tom Cruise
[0:40:42] <Zebroneath> Will Pat be okay if he picks up 1 by accident?
[0:40:46] <%TheHateFish> @Zaphire_Saucypants Pretty sure it's trans thoughts, not gay ones - it's pretty up-front, but not explicit. Unless you talk to the devs about it, then they're explicit.
[0:40:50] <Blank9> this game is about climbing a mountain via double jumps
[0:40:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> birb
[0:40:51] <+JonathLP> Wait, are mind goblins an allegory for Pat running from his MPreg thoughts?
[0:40:52] <%g0atmeal> i strongly got the impression that this is about self-acceptance
[0:40:56] <lucyucy> pat you're not beating the mind goblin if ur just not collecting them, that's a different goblin
[0:40:57] <%Cozy90> caw
[0:41:05] <@ssjklyco> @ssjklyco I'm not tlaking about Pat. I,m making fun of chat as their mind goblins get triggered
[0:41:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> Run away from gay thoughts and towards bi thoughts
[0:41:09] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:41:11] <%ConLin_Arts_> you did it
[0:41:12] <JetpackMcQuack> that was easy
[0:41:13] <%BoxNavy> good
[0:41:14] <%Monkeyweed21> BIRD
[0:41:15] <EntropyArcade> the strawberries represent gay thoughts?
[0:41:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow
[0:41:16] <+disgruntledgruntle> @PatStaresAt Is this a blind playthrough?
[0:41:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Proud of you
[0:41:19] <%TheWinged7> 11!
[0:41:21] <Vashido22> @i_chevalier yeah strawberries are for fun
[0:41:22] <ppangboi> These levels are surprisingly short if you skip all the optional stuff, huh?
[0:41:23] <DusK_The_Stray> How are you feeling?
[0:41:25] <Vyskus> we have defeated 1 (one) level of allegory
[0:41:25] <moonmintparadise> it is a literal mountain of self doubt man
[0:41:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @thehatefish I’m merely having a giggle.
[0:41:28] <i_chevalier> you need a shelter, noboby just sleeps in the snow
[0:41:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I should give this game a try. Does it perform well on Switch as it does on PC?
[0:41:35] <TheAzureOracle> From 4 hours to 10 minutes, we speedrunning now boys
[0:41:36] <%bootysteve> mind goblin deez nuts?

[0:43:28] <gaminglink25> strawberry parts
[0:43:28] <TheAzureOracle> Those are also strawberries Pat, don't grab those
[0:43:31] <Ris_Eltrut> The power level of Pat's Goblins are very big
[0:43:32] <redwidow1358> @kaji04 What happened is he spent a lot of time trying to get all the strawberries and struggling, and then a loading tip told him they don't do anything special.
[0:43:33] <%BoxNavy> u r
[0:43:33] <LoneFonte> @Kaji04 "Collecting strawberries is just for impressing your friends. Remember it is optional :) "
[0:43:34] <Kaji04> oh, you can't do it until you're prompted?
[0:43:34] <Lajong_z> cant wait to pick up those  yellow thingies
[0:43:34] <%trackles_64> Big baby mode
[0:43:40] <AoiRob> no u
[0:43:41] <Vashido22> that yellow thing is also strawberry
[0:43:41] <The_Legendairy> @PanicSwytch collecting the strawberries that don't do anything if you collect them or not

[0:43:59] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:43:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> im convinced with how many people want Pat to collect at least 1 strawberry, their mind goblins are being activated
[0:44:00] <californaya> I beat this game but fuck the B and C-sides, I can't do that shit
[0:44:02] <%Cozy90> Pat is a "baby" gamer. big difference

[0:45:45] <gaminglink25> 16
[0:45:46] <cartakus> I wonder if there is a chapter where you just fall into a strawberry
[0:45:46] <Vashido22> 16
[0:45:47] <thewrathofscience> 16
[0:45:49] <+NickHatesSnow> WARP JELLO\
[0:45:50] <AoiRob> its like mirio's quirk
[0:45:58] <FastmanJones> Wouldn't the real way to beat the goblins be trying for the strawberries you want but being able to say "I don't need it" and moving on once the attempt becomes not fun?
[0:46:00] <%BoxNavy> do you see?
[0:46:00] <%NitronStreams> Traverse the weird goo blocks
[0:46:03] <Kaji04> Do it

[0:46:26] <+Tredecian> b sides
[0:46:29] <thewrathofscience> 18
[0:46:31] <%Ipsenscastle> THIS IS DOUBLE STRAWBY
[0:46:33] <techashi69> I will donate a month's salary if Pat collects every strawberry
[0:46:35] <+Dumple_Roe> no cassette either
[0:46:36] <AoiRob> uh oh
[0:46:37] <+Kharinite> The soundtrack
[0:46:42] <%g0atmeal> what is this if not a rectangular strawberry?
[0:46:47] <BalloniWright> Try it Kappa
[0:46:47] <dukenux> ah Celeste. i can already feel my ptsd kicking in
[0:46:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> b-sides are cool
[0:46:49] <%Zeikier> more like Butt side gotem
[0:46:51] <+tempestzephyr> Butt side
[0:46:52] <JetpackMcQuack> nice
[0:46:54] <dukenux> vargDuane
[0:46:56] <%HotSauceFiend> YO yo yo, play the 2MEllo level thats super mind goblins
[0:46:56] <%RayReborne> Duh its the b side lol
[0:46:56] <Saltmeisterr> The b side for this stage is cool
[0:47:01] <Treasure_Vault> B-sides are valuable, unlike strawberries
[0:47:06] <gaminglink25> 19
[0:47:06] <thewrathofscience> 19
[0:47:07] <TheAzureOracle> B-Sides unlock stuff also
[0:47:10] <crimsonphoenix69> and B-Side unlocks content
[0:47:12] <%Zeikier> I obsess over B-sides if you get my drift
[0:47:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> B-sides lead to content
[0:47:14] <+Tredecian> b sidse are worth getting but only if you like the game enough to play more
[0:47:14] <+FattimusSlime> your mom got it on the b-side
[0:47:15] <Treasure_Vault> B-sides don't count, they do something
[0:47:16] <%g0atmeal> yeah b-sides are really fun
[0:47:18] <AoiRob> b sides are the post game extra levels
[0:47:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> real collectibles
[0:47:24] <Vyskus> an unlock is fine too
[0:47:25] <%PocketBearIllustrator> What about Side-Bs?
[0:47:30] <%RealThiele> no goblin just bees
[0:47:32] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:47:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> endless strawbees
[0:47:37] <+D00msDayDan> pat goalposts at
[0:47:37] <%Ipsenscastle> B-sides are WORSE goblins for me because they do something
[0:47:39] <%HotSauceFiend> B-Side is mini remixed level for challenge
[0:47:41] <%SirGO0SE> look at all these strawberries
[0:47:44] <bigrocksalt> just get one
[0:47:45] <Saltmeisterr> wait so is pat not getting ANY? strawbs?
[0:47:45] <%SirGO0SE> waiting to be consumed
[0:47:47] <%Mr_Pylon> New goblin, can't ever touch a strawberry
[0:47:48] <%ClericOfSparda> Yeah I can see why Pat freaked over strawberries
[0:47:54] <devanmuse> I just got here. Is the Goblin Condition just "Don't get all the strawberries" or is he not grabbing ANY of them?
[0:47:55] <%g0atmeal> alright i gotta run, have a great stream everyone :)
[0:47:58] <+Taren_Ko> Pat get the banana
[0:48:02] <+Redpointshine> Pat what are you doing? get the strawberries!
[0:48:05] <TheAzureOracle> Now you're gaming
[0:48:06] <Vashido22> Good videogame
[0:48:11] <gaminglink25> 20
[0:48:14] <hearingthenseeing> Get ready to run Pat
[0:48:14] <gaminglink25> 21
[0:48:14] <%demiiluna> I'm confused, isn't avoiding every strawberry just substituting one goblin for another?
[0:48:16] <Vashido22> 20
[0:48:32] <hearingthenseeing> it's go time
[0:48:32] <olive_js> oh boy here we go
[0:48:33] <+chiazam> Wait is the challenge that Pat isn’t allowed to get strawberries?
[0:48:34] <%RealThiele> bones
[0:48:41] <@PeachSaliva> @demiiluna I think the problem last time was that he was hyperfocused on the strawberries and thus, couldn't focus on anything else about the game.
[0:48:42] <%SirGO0SE> @demiiluna 100%
[0:48:42] <radicalApollo> I feel like the anti-strawberry run will birth NEW goblins instead of kill one
[0:48:44] <%RayReborne> No fair, she gets to fly
[0:48:46] <+tempestzephyr> I'm you, but hotter
[0:48:47] <ppangboi> @demiiluna there's always a bigger goblin
[0:48:50] <+Taren_Ko> @demiiluna That was my thought as well. The goblin is number being not complete isn't it?
[0:48:50] <%Ipsenscastle> the true test of goblin mastery is getting ONE strawby
[0:48:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> dog full
[0:48:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> peenboy

[0:58:10] <+Redpointshine> IGNORING all the strawberries is the same thing as collecting all the strawberries, you have to collect SOME of them

[0:58:34] <redwidow1358> 'Twas all a dream
[0:58:44] <@Spydurman> would collecting 1 single strawberry be worse for you goblins than none at all?
[0:58:53] <brunoberserk> @tanarath so collecting even one of them , activates the goblins ?
[0:58:58] <%TheWinged7> a fousand thollowers

[1:00:08] <%Deft_Thought> You won't be with a damn phone camera
[1:00:24] <moonmintparadise> @GalacticaPhanto The creator came out as trans and explained how retroactively they realized that celeste was about them accepting themselves and such afterall. So yeah, in a way.
[1:00:28] <%PartyFavors> The story wasn’t written about her being trans, but she IS trans and the themes are generally Trans Relatable
[1:00:45] <EntropyArcade> was that a soul eater reference?
[1:00:48] <Vyskus> @GalacticaPhanto yeah, Maddy Thorson put out a good think piece on it
[1:00:48] <olive_js> @moonmintparadise That's a nice summary. Thanks.
[1:00:53] <%demiiluna> @GalacticaPhanto Madeline is trans but the story is more about other things than it is about being trans.
[1:00:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> That's actually pretty neat to hear that its about acceptance
[1:00:59] <EntropyArcade> "he doesnt know how to deal with it"

[1:09:16] <JetpackMcQuack> fuzzy walls
[1:09:16] <AoiRob> just go collect them after beating the game if you want who cares
[1:09:16] <%RayReborne> touch once, then never again
[1:09:19] <topiodonk> 0 is still a form of perfect
[1:09:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so what goblin is he slaying today?
[1:09:23] <%Monkeyweed21> gotta go fast

[1:09:43] <+SpoopySkeletman> why is Celeste part of the Mind Goblins saga?
[1:09:45] <DusK_The_Stray> Man, I'm always so insanely disgusted by that stuff on the walls
[1:09:50] <DusK_The_Stray> Can't even tell why
[1:09:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> @0ni34 That's why we made him get 1
[1:09:54] <gaminglink25> 55
[1:09:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @0ni34 that's why he just got one
[1:10:01] <+pectusumbra> @SpoopySkeletman the strawberries kept pat from enjoying
[1:10:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "What about that meat sack you keep puppeting?"
[1:10:03] <%Buzzard42> @SpoopySkeletman strawberries were mandatory to Pat
[1:10:04] <%TheWinged7> @0ni34 yes, thats why we convinced him to get one
[1:10:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Says the man floating Baron Harkonnen style
[1:10:12] <gaminglink25> 56
[1:10:18] <+SpoopySkeletman> ah, I see
[1:10:19] <gaminglink25> 57
[1:10:26] <+izanagi22> @0ni34 Not when you consider how much time/frustration you put in comparison to getting all vs avoiding them

[1:11:14] <gaminglink25> die
[1:11:15] <+izanagi22> @gaminglink25 Please stop, the game's counting for us
[1:11:15] <%RealThiele> only 2 dishonored goblin slain
[1:11:19] <DracaenaLeaf> here we go
[1:11:20] <%SirGO0SE> ooo that one has wings
[1:11:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH STRAWBERRY
[1:11:22] <%SWFanatic> clingy wall
[1:11:22] <gaminglink25> 64
[1:11:24] <%TheWinged7> you can do it pat slay the goblin
[1:11:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> CATCH IT
[1:11:29] <%Zeikier> so pat how do I play Dishonored if I'm not good at finding off-beat solutions to problems?
[1:11:30] <gaminglink25> 65
[1:11:38] <%SWFanatic> NO
[1:11:39] <gaminglink25> 66
[1:11:41] <thewrathofscience> @DusK_The_Stray bc their asymmetry mimics dirt, slime, and parasites at the same time
[1:11:46] <gaminglink25> 67
[1:11:51] <%SWFanatic> NO Flap Berry
[1:11:52] <gaminglink25> 68
[1:11:53] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt the fuzz isn't time sensitive
[1:11:59] <gaminglink25> 69
[1:12:00] <+izanagi22> @PatStaresAt Winged strawberries force you to go in a certain route
[1:12:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Go under
[1:12:02] <doster504> @RealThiele did he beat it off stream then?
[1:12:07] <%Buzzard42> close one
[1:12:08] <+rafaelba93> shit only grows when you leave the surface
[1:12:13] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele ye
[1:12:14] <%Buzzard42> YEAH
[1:12:14] <@ssjklyco> No dash
[1:12:17] <gaminglink25> no dash
[1:12:20] <buddhistmetal> just don't dash :)
[1:12:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You can take your time o nthe tentically bits
[1:12:21] <DusK_The_Stray> @DusK_The_Stray Ugh, you're right, that's it. Thanks, I hate it, lmao
[1:12:21] <gaminglink25> 70
[1:12:22] <Saltmeisterr> @rafaelba93 ^
[1:12:22] <dreadedcthulhu> you have to get to it without dashing
[1:12:26] <tanarath> Pat, it's free
[1:12:27] <gaminglink25> 71
[1:12:28] <%Buzzard42> winged ones say don't dash
[1:12:29] <doster504> @RealThiele oh ok thanks bud
[1:12:29] <ppangboi> it is
[1:12:31] <gaminglink25> 72
[1:12:35] <+itsmonktastic> The game counts the deaths already lol, you don’t need to do it
[1:12:39] <%Zeikier> you can dash to collect it but if you're too far away it'll flee
[1:12:41] <californaya> yeah, Pat, that's the point
[1:12:42] <+Sullen_Walrus> What about a must use consumables run in an rpg where you cant sell or discard consumables and if you have any left after beating the final boss you must reload a save
[1:12:46] <%Zeikier> so like, dashing to pick it up is fine if you're close enough
[1:12:47] <%SWFanatic> Modern Problems require Modern Solutions
[1:12:51] <%RayReborne> like the no jetpack levels in Sunshine, except one room lol
[1:12:52] <gaminglink25> 73

[1:13:42] <thewrathofscience> You can only get them with the dash itself
[1:13:43] <Saltmeisterr> BITCH
[1:13:45] <gaminglink25> 81
[1:13:45] <%SWFanatic> berries are lies
[1:13:50] <+Redpointshine> get the berry
[1:13:55] <hearingthenseeing> remember your wall cling pat
[1:13:56] <%Ne1son> How bad is just one more strawberry
[1:13:59] <gaminglink25> 82
[1:14:03] <Treasure_Vault> Seeing the berry and not taking it is a pro gamer move. I love this stream.
[1:14:04] <+tempestzephyr> psaGoblin
[1:14:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GET IT
[1:14:06] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt would you hate 2 berries more than one?
[1:14:08] <gaminglink25> 83
[1:14:17] <The_Legendairy> @hearingthenseeing i think he thinks the fuzzies are timing based
[1:14:22] <%SWFanatic> I'd hate one berry more than 2
[1:14:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The Berry Tho
[1:14:33] <gaminglink25> 84
[1:14:34] <%Ipsenscastle> I guess the goblin won't be slain until he views the strawbs completely arbitrarily
[1:14:35] <gaminglink25> 85
[1:14:39] <+silentblast93> 83 death this stram or the whole game ?
[1:14:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @SWFanatic So does Pat Kappa
[1:14:45] <chancho4tierra> 1 strawberry is the new goblin?
[1:14:45] <gaminglink25> 86
[1:14:54] <+Sullen_Walrus> what if he got all but one berry
[1:14:57] <KyberNasse> Mods get this Count von Count pls
[1:14:59] <%SirGO0SE> damn hes good

[1:15:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GUD
[1:15:17] <%SWFanatic> get the banana
[1:15:21] <+epoladia> Wouldn’t partial completion hurt the goblins more than minimized completion?
[1:15:24] <+samsaric_prisoner> I feel like collecting all the berries and then purposely missing the last few would hurt a lot more then a 0 berry run.
[1:15:30] <gaminglink25> 89
[1:15:34] <gaminglink25> 90
[1:15:38] <+silentblast93> 90

[1:15:43] <+silentblast93> 91
[1:15:45] <Therusher> @epoladia he got 1 optional berry to kill that goblin
[1:15:47] <gaminglink25> 92
[1:15:52] <+izanagi22> @epoladia No, because minimal is just a new goblin

[1:28:44] <ppangboi> I just gotta say I'm gonna be pretty disappointed in the death counter person if their number ends up different from the games death count
[1:28:45] <+Tredecian> not yet
[1:28:45] <olive_js> Oh, it will be.
[1:28:48] <%asgard147> limesDance
[1:28:49] <$ashenfrenzy> god path of pain was so legitimately fun
[1:28:49] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i hear celeste gets ballsier
[1:28:49] <%TheWinged7> yup the b sides
[1:28:49] <%Ne1son> Man fuck Path of Pain
[1:28:50] <%SharkMissile> What's Path of Pain?
[1:28:52] <+izanagi22> The DLC and C-sides are closer
[1:28:52] <gaminglink25> it gets way harder later on in the extra stuff
[1:28:53] <AoiRob> not YET
[1:28:57] <%RealThiele> B and C-side shit is nuts
[1:29:00] <+itsmonktastic> path of pain is especially hard since the platforming stuff comes out of nowhere
[1:29:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Path of Pain was a fuck
[1:29:03] <Saltmeisterr> chapter 9 monkaS
[1:29:05] <BigFingerRo> THIS HAS THINGS HARDER THAN PATH OF PAIN?
[1:29:08] <californaya> Path of Pain was Hollow Knight, right?
[1:29:08] <+FNTR> Farewell is indeed some pain
[1:29:17] <Aydarkzero> but when you finish Path of Pain it feels real good
[1:29:21] <Explodincatz> path of pain is so good
[1:29:21] <%TheLemuroid> The main game isn't bad
[1:29:26] <+Bob_Tom> also actual death
[1:29:31] <Treasure_Vault> I spent like 8 hours on one jump in path of pain. It was a lot of fun.
[1:29:32] <olive_js> Farewell has kaizo.
[1:29:32] <%Deft_Thought> I need to go back and beat Hollow Knight
[1:29:35] <californaya> also yeah, Hollow Knight didn't really have a lot of challenging platforming until that point
[1:29:41] <%RealThiele> gotta learn to pogo good bug bitch
[1:29:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> Path of Pain absolutely requires the charm combo for regenerating shield
[1:29:43] <%TheLemuroid> Real challenge is B and C sides and the DLC
[1:29:43] <%SWFanatic> Chasm? But I 'ardly know 'em!
[1:29:48] <+pectusumbra> I still remember when Pat managed to scum out that one part of PoP with a repeated down attack jump and skipped part of it
[1:29:50] <Explodincatz> not to mention the music in PoP
[1:29:53] <%Buzzard42> yeah PoP's biggest challenge is the fact that it represents a massive difficulty spike
[1:29:54] <gaminglink25> 132
[1:29:57] <gaminglink25> 133
[1:29:58] <ppangboi> I can hear the buzzsaws in the white palace in my dreams
[1:29:59] <topiodonk> i wish i could get over the artstyle in hollow knight i really dont like it
[1:30:11] <gaminglink25> 134
[1:30:13] <TheAzureOracle> The post game content in Celesete is where the actual difficulty kicks in
[1:30:16] <%Buzzard42> Celeste has Harder things, but it also eases you into the challenge over the course of the game
[1:30:27] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:30:33] <gaminglink25> 135
[1:30:34] <anAngryHamster> @topiodonk BOO THIS MAN

[1:31:49] <Saltmeisterr> @Kriss1827 not doing extra content
[1:31:54] <Saltmeisterr> lol
[1:31:55] <Therusher> I thought PoP was challenging but doable, but some of the optional zones in this game were way too much for me
[1:31:55] <+itsmonktastic> the mind goblin is that strawberries don't unlock anything
[1:31:59] <moonbearbacon> I. think good be therapy would be attempting the strawberries
[1:32:01] <gaminglink25> 138
[1:32:04] <gaminglink25> 139
[1:32:09] <topiodonk> @aoirob yep, the game is beautiful but i dont like the characters, and i know the game is good, i just cant get into it

[1:32:48] <marvel877> @Kriss1827 first time he played it, he spent 5 hours on the first chapter getting EVERYTHING, then turned off the game when the loading screen for chapter 2 said "Strawberries don't do anything."

[1:37:25] <+itsmonktastic> GIEF larxaComfy
[1:37:27] <HyperionXV> It's... spammy?
[1:37:29] <WebmanJax> So, what's the goblin for this one? Is it just the strawberries? Does it actually help to just ignore them? Shouldn't you be trying to get them where you can?
[1:37:30] <gaminglink25> 152
[1:37:34] <gaminglink25> 153
[1:37:46] <Grethe_B> @asdfpire Eeeeey!!! grethe1Grethepog
[1:38:08] <$velgaduere> @gaminglink25 so I get specifically why you're doing it, but it's kind of gunking up the chat dude
[1:38:20] <gaminglink25> @HyperionXV pat doesn't seem to mind
[1:38:35] <Saltmeisterr> Strawb zone pat
[1:38:40] <ppangboi> @HyperionXV sure but a lot of people in chat seem to
[1:38:45] <gaminglink25> 154
[1:38:51] <+demon1103> @WebmanJax he already has 1...so it's tainted his no strawberry count
[1:38:52] <gaminglink25> 155
[1:38:56] <gaminglink25> 156
[1:39:02] <%Saadi90> I’m about to hide chat because of the spamming numbers. Bbye
[1:39:07] <moonbearbacon> @webmanjax my thoughts exactly
[1:39:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> since the game already keeps track of his death counts, its just annoying dude
[1:39:19] <$velgaduere> @gaminglink25 okay so you only care about Pat and not other people who actually comprise the chat, got it

[1:39:52] <%Selmassian> Thank you @patstaresat
[1:39:55] <%SWFanatic> Bye Gief
[1:39:56] <%Saadi90> Thanks Pat!
[1:39:57] <NeroInfinite> two strawberries.
[1:39:58] <Treasure_Vault> To really mess with him
[1:39:58] <%TheHateFish> @HotSauceFiend Yeah, but the game autotracks it
[1:39:59] <%SWFanatic> Good night
[1:40:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> just uh, track to the closest hundred
[1:40:02] <%justcallmebobplease> @gaminglink25 Please keep the count going and post it at the end or something, it's fun to know.
[1:40:03] <BreakersAweigh> thanks pat
[1:40:08] <%ConLin_Arts_> how much snacks do you give Gief each day?
[1:40:16] <Brandon__Brando> you know this is a good game to slay your irl mind goblins with the games story and all

[1:40:21] <Fenlig> I've really enjoyed the Mass Effect content Pat thanks!
[1:40:25] <Treasure_Vault> If you only do 100's, he'll keep checking chat whenever he thinks he might be close
[1:40:28] <Therusher> For people that want to know, Deaths do show at the end of each level and in level select
[1:40:33] <%SWFanatic> MUSIC UP
[1:40:41] <Sowlith> oh wait pat's getting the b-sides though?

[1:53:47] <+Tredecian> oof
[1:53:47] <%vVAstrAVv> did you collect all the MONSTIES
[1:53:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> Pokemon has made it so ridiculous to collect them all that its super not worth it anymore
[1:53:48] <Darthkitten_Prime> Hey, there's a game for your mind goblin series.
[1:53:51] <ToneBacas> the flags man
[1:53:51] <gaminglink25> oof

[1:54:01] <%Ipsenscastle> OMG you got the stupid AC1 flags???
[1:54:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD
[1:54:03] <%NitronStreams> Its like having only Volumes "1,2, and 6" from your favorite series
[1:54:05] <hearingthenseeing> Pat as caveman would have been great, find all the herbs
[1:54:05] <@commanderclaw> Hoo boy, that's some SHIT

[1:54:11] <%RayReborne> oh god, 3 has a LOT of garbage to collect lol
[1:54:12] <%Dova573> AC3 burn me out the same way
[1:54:12] <%ConLin_Arts_> I was close to 100% AC2 but I was missing one feather
[1:54:12] <%twistedj3ster> I got every Riddler trophy over the 4 games but that's because I'm stubborn
[1:54:14] <$ImExtremelyManly> is this why you hate banjo
[1:54:16] <Tracazoid> So Pat, how much is maxing all social links in a Persona game a Mind Goblin for you?
[1:54:16] <%ClericOfSparda> You explained that on the podcast before re: pokemon
[1:54:20] <+pectusumbra> just play an indie mons game. there are a bunch now. Casette beasts is coming soon
[1:54:20] <ToneBacas> "Salute, Claudia!"
[1:54:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PatStaresAt did you get all the korok seeds in botw?
[1:54:24] <%Mr_Pylon> 100% Ubisoft games is uggggggh
[1:54:26] <+MrSuplexArt> completing everything for the sake of completing it would drive me insane. I'm sorry for your brain orcs
[1:54:30] <%RayReborne> DAMN WHAT
[1:54:31] <gaminglink25> oof
[1:54:31] <%Zeikier> oh god why
[1:54:32] <LoneFonte> why?
[1:54:33] <+Tredecian> i foolowed a guide for ascreed 2 feathers and at the end I was missing two and then stopped caring
[1:54:36] <%SovPho> ac:b's multiplayer was actually fun though
[1:54:37] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT MP WAS GREAT
[1:54:39] <Saltmeisterr> THE WHAT
[1:54:41] <%Zeikier> good thing you never tried to platinum Armored Core For Answer
[1:54:42] <dan_g_v> what a dork
[1:54:42] <%Dova573> The Multiplayer was fun though
[1:54:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> That multiplayer was both jank and fun
[1:54:48] <gaminglink25> goblins
[1:54:50] <+rafaelba93> it was
[1:54:52] <Mattais88> I did every bit of side content in Spiderman, and ignored the story.
[1:54:57] <+Tredecian> yeah
[1:54:57] <marrowjuice> It was pretty awesp,e
[1:55:01] <%DashXero> AC multi is weird. It's more fun the less leveled up you are.
[1:55:03] <%bear_breaker20> it had a meta that people abused of course
[1:55:05] <%Ipsenscastle> I had some good times in Brotherhood multi
[1:55:06] <LoneFonte> oh ok, I though it was related to a unlockable or something
[1:55:06] <%RayReborne> i hated it, kept dying lol. then again, i was 13 at the time lol
[1:55:12] <wqorst> was that the MP where you just walked around in NPCs and got randomly stabbed
[1:55:15] <Tracazoid> Ubisoft was surprisingly good at stealth game Multiplayer, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory MP was awesome
[1:55:20] <$velgaduere> close
[1:55:20] <Treasure_Vault> Trans closet!
[1:55:20] <+mikesapartment> its more depression
[1:55:21] <Sowlith> not really
[1:55:23] <%Monkeyweed21> NO
[1:55:24] <ExpressNode> I played Black Flag and Unity when I got a the Xbox One bundle in 2014 for black friday and never touched it
[1:55:26] <hearingthenseeing> Anxiety
[1:55:28] <BigFingerRo> Not really
[1:55:30] <Darthkitten_Prime> ...Not exactly.
[1:55:31] <gaminglink25> just depression in general really
[1:55:31] <+izanagi22> Mental Health generally
[1:55:34] <Saltmeisterr> Not exactly
[1:55:35] <FastmanJones> It's more generalized anxiety
[1:55:36] <@commanderclaw> Mental Health in general really
[1:55:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its about anxiety and depression
[1:55:38] <marvel877> Its general depression and anxiety.
[1:55:43] <+MrSuplexArt> Do you have a mind goblin set for an RPG where you use elixirs as you get them?
[1:55:43] <hearingthenseeing> You could interpret it that way
[1:55:44] <+Dakuu75> I dont think so but idk
[1:55:46] <SyntaxTakes> Madeline is literally trans lmao
[1:55:51] <Brandon__Brando> just general mental health its kida vague
[1:55:52] <%TheLemuroid> I really hope Pat makes it to the feather scene
[1:55:53] <+Kilborn119> some trans stuff in there as well
[1:55:54] <ppangboi> my friend refers to this game as "depression mountain"
[1:55:59] <+Tredecian> kinda, originally it was anxiety but a dev came out as trans after and said that was the origin of those feelings
[1:56:00] <+pectusumbra> mental health and self acceptance I believe
[1:56:02] <Therusher> Think it's just general anxiety. There was some confirmed stuff about madeline but it's not really the theme
[1:56:04] <tanarath> the gobolin closet
[1:56:05] <ChaosedStar> Maddie is Trans
[1:56:05] <ToneBacas> it's a Canada
[1:56:06] <arizenarkana> There were some solid multiplayer modes in 7th generation that never came back. It's a shame.
[1:56:06] <ExpressNode> Meant to say never touched it again
[1:56:08] <%Mr_Pylon> Look it's a big Canada
[1:56:08] <BalloniWright> THE LEAF
[1:56:09] <Saltmeisterr> FUCK THIS
[1:56:10] <%SWFanatic> It's me, your mental illness!
[1:56:11] <+Kilborn119> OPTIMAL FLAG
[1:56:12] <hearingthenseeing> WE MADE IT
[1:56:12] <$velgaduere> the creator said making the game was a way of them understanding themselves as being trans @PatStaresAt
[1:56:12] <%RayReborne> i dont see the trans thing, doesn't mean you cant interpret it that eay yourself
[1:56:13] <dan_g_v> canadia!!
[1:56:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> canananada
[1:56:15] <Sowlith> the story isn't really about madeline being trans, she just happens to be trans
[1:56:16] <%Ipsenscastle> that flag looks dumb
[1:56:18] <Saltmeisterr> I HATE GLOBAL WIND AAAAAA
[1:56:21] <gaminglink25> orb
[1:56:31] <+itsmonktastic> we got some mind goblins in chat eh :p
[1:56:36] <%JoshManVGH> Symbolizing the three province of Canadaia and their one giant leaf.
[1:56:37] <%Ipsenscastle> what kind of loser would have a flag like that
[1:56:42] <%RayReborne> @swfanatic ah, a Tommy Bones connoisseur
[1:56:44] <+Ell1ot> hehehe
[1:56:46] <%Agami23> well considering what badeline was talking about. maybe madeline has a hero complex and is just aware of it
[1:56:48] <marvel877> One of the devs didn't realize till after they finished the game they made a trans allegory with the game and came out as a result.
[1:56:51] <majindusto> Strawberry
[1:56:55] <BigFingerRo> quick, sing the national anthem
[1:56:56] <+JonathLP> That's not the canadian flag
[1:56:58] <Treasure_Vault> The developer wrote Madeleine to reflect their own mental stuff, then figured out they were trans, then figured out Madeleine was trans and put it in some DLC. Seems therapeutic for the dev.
[1:56:58] <+Tredecian> sticky flag
[1:57:03] <+JonathLP> It has a strawberry instead of a maple leaf
[1:57:03] <%borkmire> all you did was make a new ocd rule for your self thats just get all the things or none at you wont beat this goblin like this
[1:57:14] <Mariakko> It's got a cool leaf on it
[1:57:16] <%JoshManVGH> it's better than our explosions of stars and stripes
[1:57:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ohio flag is best flag, it's like a angry lil monster
[1:57:20] <%Monkeyweed21> you could do alot worse than any of the North America flags
[1:57:21] <%Ipsenscastle> Wales has the best flag, it's got a freakin' dragon on it
[1:57:23] <+DigbyMayor> Just tuned in, how is he handling the goblinry?

[2:02:34] <+MrSuplexArt> this seems less about conquering a mind goblin, and more about replacing one goblin with another

[2:02:36] <%Mr_Pylon> TRAPPED IN THE GOBLIN CAGE
[2:02:37] <gitdweezzy> its pity strawberry
[2:02:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> CHAOSBERRYS
[2:02:38] <peyodogo> GET BERRY
[2:02:39] <Brandon__Brando> I dont think trying to avoid them like this is helping
[2:02:39] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[2:02:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> eat the berry you coward
[2:02:41] <%NitronStreams> LUL YOU PLAYED YOURSELF
[2:02:44] <+Tredecian> smug straberry
[2:02:44] <TheOriginalMyth> Accept the eventual 7/25, it is meaningless!
[2:02:45] <Mattais88> No escape
[2:02:46] <%MechArch> close your eyes
[2:02:51] <scrumbotime> the biggest goblin, being fine with things not going perfectly
[2:02:51] <majindusto> YOU CANNOT WIN
[2:02:52] <BigFingerRo> 5 is good
[2:02:57] <+PenmanLupine> good, just deal with it and find out you aren't going to die at the end
[2:02:57] <%Ipsenscastle> you'll achieve victory when you no longer care if you get the strawb or not
[2:02:58] <BigFingerRo> 5 fingers on your hand
[2:02:58] <Therusher> The true mind goblin slaying is being indifferent to getting berries or not, seems like we're getting there
[2:03:02] <peyodogo> you should now get another berry so it's no longer a nice number like 5
[2:03:02] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Eat the fruit, Pat!
[2:03:02] <%Ipsenscastle> be zen
[2:03:03] <thewrathofscience> Cant escape the vitamin C
[2:03:03] <%Frost_Quill> I burned out SUPER HARD on this game and I never even got to this part.  I stopped after 100%ing the hotel and everything before it.
[2:03:08] <Darthkitten_Prime> @cobalt_phoenix_ His goal was to avoid all of them, getting some, but not all of them is worse in his mind.
[2:03:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Accept the strawberry as your lord and savior.
[2:03:17] <hearingthenseeing> Cling
[2:03:22] <Saltmeisterr> u missed a fun secret pat
[2:03:23] <%TheLemuroid> Also not clear. You can only steer from the depressed panel on the side
[2:03:24] <moonbearbacon> @patstaresat surely the goal is any number below 100%
[2:03:28] <+MrSuplexArt> you should ignore strawberries. Like, as if they weren't even physically or conceptually there.
[2:03:44] <gaminglink25> THIS NOTHING COMPARED TO LATER ON
[2:03:50] <%SWFanatic> Strawberry: "I don't care for your disingenuous assertions."
[2:04:06] <cheapdoc> What level is pat on?
[2:04:12] <%madmanrambler> @MrSuplexArt don't shake the strawberries' hand, don't look the strawberry in the eye, don't gg the strawberry
[2:04:14] <BigFingerRo> NO GETTY GETTY
[2:04:14] <gaminglink25> 4
[2:04:19] <LoneFonte> this level 4, i think
[2:04:19] <%RayReborne> its a BIG trip
[2:04:20] <%madmanrambler> I think Pat is on level 4 of... 6 or 7?
[2:04:33] <DracaenaLeaf> tons
[2:04:34] <LorcaNomad> a lot
[2:04:34] <cheapdoc> That's pretty sick
[2:04:35] <%SWFanatic> Big sneaky sneak
[2:04:35] <gaminglink25> 9
[2:04:36] <+Tredecian> many
[2:04:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's pretty short
[2:04:37] <cheapdoc> he's doing great
[2:04:37] <Dio_TR> LUL LUL LUL
[2:04:37] <Hideow> a lot LUL
[2:04:39] <Saltmeisterr> 7
[2:04:39] <+JonathLP> couple hundred?
[2:04:40] <Komayeda> I think like, 7
[2:04:42] <Brandon__Brando> 7
[2:04:42] <gaminglink25> but only 7 mandatory
[2:04:42] <Therusher> I wanna say 7-8 plus extras
[2:04:44] <%madmanrambler> woops, don't mind me
[2:04:48] <gaminglink25> 2 optional
[2:04:48] <Saltmeisterr> 7 main ones
[2:04:50] <+pectusumbra> I saw someone mention chapter 9 before
[2:04:52] <LorcaNomad> many but the post-game is huge big
[2:04:53] <%SirGO0SE> 20 minutes :)
[2:04:53] <Saltmeisterr> 2 extra
[2:04:54] <Darthkitten_Prime> 7 for the main story, up to nine for extra
[2:04:55] <dan_g_v> 5 millions
[2:04:59] <AoiRob> 7 main chapters
[2:05:02] <%RayReborne> like......... 8 or so, plus be sides and other extra levels
[2:05:04] <%Mr_Pylon> Some are long
[2:05:04] <TheOriginalMyth> bunch of extra levels too tho
[2:05:05] <gaminglink25> and then 16 extra hard ones
[2:05:05] <ppangboi> ignoring b-sides, c-sides and extras its shortish, especially when skipping optional content
[2:05:08] <TheAzureOracle> The extra content is long
[2:05:09] <$velgaduere> which is the perfect reason to go back and get those strawberries right ha ha :)
[2:05:11] <Saltmeisterr> well
[2:05:13] <%madmanrambler> I honestly just played to the end of the main story, I wasn't enjoying the platforming much on its own
[2:05:13] <+Tredecian> chapter have a lot of rooms then the extra content
[2:05:18] <Saltmeisterr> theres also b sides
[2:05:19] <%DashXero> Why is Pat collecting strawberries?
[2:05:20] <Brandon__Brando> 7 plus the b and c sides so 21
[2:05:21] <Saltmeisterr> and c sides
[2:05:22] <marvel877> 7 main ones, then the DLC and B Sides, C Sides
[2:05:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> honestly you could probably beat it in less time than it took you to give up on level one
[2:05:26] <+pectusumbra> I think that one is to use the orb to go back
[2:05:27] <LoneFonte> 7 main story, 2 post game and a ton of extras levels
[2:05:27] <%DashXero> Be strong, Pat.
[2:05:30] <$velgaduere> Celeste is the kind of game that doesn't start until you beat it
[2:05:31] <FastmanJones> Turns out the game is unsubstantial when you ignore half the content
[2:05:42] <cheapdoc> He's really close to bearing his goblin then, I BELIEVE IN YOU PAT
[2:05:48] <cheapdoc> *BEATING
[2:05:51] <Darthkitten_Prime> They
[2:05:54] <Saltmeisterr> bonus
[2:05:54] <gaminglink25> bonus levels
[2:05:54] <ppangboi> both kinda
[2:05:58] <Darthkitten_Prime> They're the epilogue.
[2:05:59] <+JonathLP> true ending requires you to get all the strawberries
[2:05:59] <Hideow> bonus,pretty hard
[2:05:59] <marvel877> DLC EPILOGUE
[2:06:00] <TheOrzhovPrince> Secret ending stuff, sort of
[2:06:03] <%TheLemuroid> 8 is a bonus of sorts. 9 is DLC
[2:06:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cheapdoc oh no
[2:06:11] <%SWFanatic> i will face my goblin, I will let is pass through me, only I will remain
[2:06:11] <+rafaelba93> I dont know, couldnt beat them lol
[2:06:12] <Therusher> There are levels 8-9 that require you to do b and c-side remixes of all the previous ones I think
[2:06:12] <LoneFonte> 9 was added much later
[2:06:13] <%TheLemuroid> The DLC is looong
[2:06:22] <TheOrzhovPrince> Advice for chapter 9. If you do it, turn on every assist unless you are a god of platforming
[2:06:24] <dukenux> i died so many times
[2:06:29] <gaminglink25> each chapter(except 9) has 2 hard versions, 7 main chapters, 2 optional ones
[2:06:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt there's a big post game level, plus the B sides and finally the C sides
[2:06:29] <Komayeda> oh man, I forgot about 8...
[2:06:32] <+TheotherKristian> I just got here, how are Pat's Gind Moblins?!?!
[2:06:46] <blue8moon> he suffers
[2:06:46] <cheapdoc> @TheotherKristian He's doing great
[2:06:48] <dukenux> also, going back to the DLC after like a months worth break HURTS
[2:06:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Being slowly defeated
[2:06:49] <Darthkitten_Prime> @TheotherKristian He
[2:06:50] <%madmanrambler> well he's gotten 5 strawberries and he's halfway through the game
[2:06:52] <+JonathLP> @TheotherKristian Mind goblins are feasting tonight
[2:06:59] <LoneFonte> @TheotherKristian very intense
[2:07:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I believe you can beat off this goblin, Pat. Beat it off hard, till it can’t come anymore.
[2:07:01] <dukenux> nah, just jump good :)
[2:07:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> just jump better
[2:07:02] <LorcaNomad> yea this is where it gets unforgiving
[2:07:05] <%SWFanatic> @TheotherKristian You gotta know when to fold'em and when to hold'em
[2:07:09] <blue8moon> he's working through it
[2:07:12] <%TheLemuroid> @TheotherKristian He identified the problem as being from "incomplete collections"
[2:07:14] <ppangboi> B-sides and C-sides really ask you to show mastery of level mechanics
[2:07:20] <AoiRob> no its easy baby game :)
[2:07:22] <%baka_sugoi> psaDab
[2:07:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> nailed it
[2:07:31] <Darthkitten_Prime> @TheotherKristian Hes struggling, but in a good way I think?
[2:07:48] <TheTakkster> Celeste is the hardest game anyone can beat
[2:07:49] <Botman_R> Better to get that first one in the hotel, then where you got that second one.
[2:07:53] <dukenux> yeah fuck you strawberry
[2:07:56] <dukenux> i don't need you
[2:08:09] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[2:08:10] <%rkbinder> extra bit?
[2:08:13] <olive_js> @Darthkitten_Prime I disagree actually. Pat is doing extremely well for his first go.
[2:08:22] <%SWFanatic> put on a sweater
[2:08:28] <+itsmonktastic> he's beginning to believe
[2:08:30] <%SWFanatic> its chilly outside
[2:08:30] <LoneFonte> YEAH, TRYING JUST FOR TRYING
[2:08:35] <TheOriginalMyth> Cool room
[2:08:38] <hearingthenseeing> Pat no
[2:08:40] <Luthwag> Is this the first stream of Celeste on the mind goblin quest?
[2:08:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> @olive_js No no, I mean with the mind goblins.
[2:08:41] <JetpackMcQuack> the wind is fun
[2:08:43] <+Tredecian> love this game
[2:08:47] <%twohitgood> is this okay/
[2:08:50] <LorcaNomad> good training tho
[2:08:54] <LoneFonte> @Luthwag yes
[2:08:54] <%Mr_Pylon> The berry challenges can be super fun
[2:08:56] <olive_js> @Darthkitten_Prime oh my apologies!
[2:08:56] <gaminglink25> JUST WAIT FOR THE DEATHLESS STRAWBERRIES
[2:08:59] <+itsmonktastic> you had 1 mor edash!
[2:09:00] <ppangboi> I find the wind mechanic to be one of the harder ones, it was difficult for me to grasp how much momentum you have
[2:09:04] <%RayReborne> forwars bubble, diagonal diagonal
[2:09:07] <%zzNamttamzz> psaGoblin
[2:09:11] <dukenux> if i done it, you can do it
[2:09:12] <$velgaduere> @Darthkitten_Prime his Dishonored playthrough granted him coping skills
[2:09:14] <ShawnEXE> wait why pat get strawberry nao
[2:09:19] <cheapdoc> You could just go man, it looks like an optional room
[2:09:26] <bigrocksalt> to defeat goblin
[2:09:28] <cheapdoc> don't lose to the goblins this far in
[2:09:29] <hearingthenseeing> Pat's need to accomplish challenge is fighting the anti goblins
[2:09:29] <%SWFanatic> some still say you can hear him running away from strawberries late at night under a full moon
[2:09:36] <%DashXero> Does this room just exist to get that strawberry?
[2:09:37] <%Infernal_Dalek> Lol
[2:09:38] <bigrocksalt> NIGHTMARE SLAIN
[2:09:40] <dukenux> LUL
[2:09:46] <marvel877> GOTTEM
[2:09:46] <+itsmonktastic> he's realized the point of the strawberries is to get you to play the game
[2:09:47] <dukenux> thank god
[2:09:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> the real goblin is only getting some strawberries @ShawnEXE
[2:09:50] <+Tredecian> get 6 tho
[2:09:51] <majindusto> Suuuuuuuuuuure
[2:09:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh my god pat
[2:09:52] <JetpackMcQuack> compromise
[2:09:53] <%Infernal_Dalek> Goblin appeased...for now
[2:09:53] <sydowoodo> now get 10
[2:09:54] <hearingthenseeing> Balance restored
[2:09:55] <%twohitgood> oh that was a multiple goblin?
[2:09:55] <%zzNamttamzz> psaBig psaWrong
[2:09:56] <Therusher> Legitimately impressed
[2:09:57] <$velgaduere> smush
[2:09:58] <%madmanrambler> okay, not an ideal reason to challenge a goblin but we'll take it
[2:09:58] <%DashXero> Oh no. Pat's making treaties with the Goblins.
[2:09:58] <%SWFanatic> 5 is a nice number
[2:10:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ohhhh noooo. The goblins are stacking
[2:10:05] <Brandon__Brando> oh no were hitting the type of number now
[2:10:06] <AoiRob> now get 50
[2:10:06] <gaminglink25> @Tredecian he is at 6
[2:10:07] <%SWFanatic> Come in!
[2:10:09] <+tomdwarf> well then, we need to get you to a number that is "wrong" then. How about 6?
[2:10:15] <%SirGO0SE> i saw that you had 6
[2:10:16] <%SWFanatic> Enter!
[2:10:17] <FastmanJones> See Pat, there was an optional challenge that interested you, and you completed it. That's the end of the thought
[2:10:18] <hearingthenseeing> You don't need it
[2:10:20] <%KnifeyMcEdge> WHO SAID THAT?
[2:10:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man conquering the 5 or 0 goblin is gonna be a doozy
[2:10:21] <%SirGO0SE> 10 is a better number imo
[2:10:25] <+itsmonktastic> tbh it's probalby 5/27
[2:10:27] <Brandon__Brando> you got to make it a number you dont like to stay on brand
[2:10:38] <+itsmonktastic> or 5/23 or something
[2:10:43] <hearingthenseeing> This one gave me issues
[2:10:47] <Therusher> Isn't that what he just did? Realized he was at 5, knew it was 'good' to slay the number?
[2:10:53] <TheOriginalMyth> yea yea yea
[2:11:01] <LorcaNomad> gotta dash straight up
[2:11:01] <DaCheekyOne> Damn, it that door bell is trippy, I keep wanting to check the door

[2:13:16] <%hewlettfan96> @saltmeisterr yaaay you see it too?
[2:13:40] <cheapdoc> Which is the strongest, LP tax or podcast tax?
[2:13:42] <Mattais88> Fitting seeing as how braindead Little Hope was
[2:13:46] <+Tredecian> crack in the wall
[2:13:47] <%Agami23> the game looks ok
[2:13:49] <LorcaNomad> I hear its good
[2:13:54] <%SWFanatic> it looks like killing floor to me
[2:13:54] <%SovPho> It's okay. It's really hard on anything above receruit
[2:13:58] <DusK_The_Stray> I liked it
[2:13:58] <+rafaelba93> its fun once you get the hang of the cards
[2:13:59] <%SovPho> recruit
[2:14:04] <%Nahual_Amini> Its good
[2:14:04] <dukenux> oh shit what
[2:14:07] <+mikesapartment> it's hard and people are bad
[2:14:08] <Therusher> I think it's good but the difficulty can be all over the place, and the AI director can screw you over randomly
[2:14:08] <%hewlettfan96> These graphics are gorgeous
[2:14:09] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Its hard until its not. Like any Rogue Lite game
[2:14:09] <%thedankestmeeme> I love/hate that game already its a good relationship
[2:14:10] <@commanderclaw> I haven't played it, but I desperately hope it gets updated to be great
[2:14:32] <dukenux> looks like a shortcut too

[2:24:15] <Mattais88> 75%
[2:24:17] <%SWFanatic> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:24:19] <$velgaduere> the centipede sensed your fear and took advantage of it
[2:24:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> ain't that just the way

[2:24:28] <Dio_TR> What if the centipede crawls up you butt
[2:24:29] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:24:30] <sydowoodo> it was destined to happen
[2:24:30] <%NitronStreams> So....just as planned?
[2:24:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> This is why I usually have the vacuum ready to deploy in my basement office

[2:24:53] <%RayReborne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazy Kappa
[2:24:55] <%ForlornCarton> Naw, she let them loose to get the spiders
[2:24:55] <%Mr_Pylon> They love rocks

[2:25:02] <%SirGO0SE> fresh diapey Pat limesOk
[2:25:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> nooo
[2:25:07] <VentWilsn> thats just ur anxiety
[2:25:10] <%AnthroMetal> release the pedes
[2:25:10] <+MrSuplexArt> growing up, at least once a week we'd have a snake in our basement
[2:25:15] <@goose_attack_almanac> whenever I see one in my basement I lose my mind trying to remove it
[2:25:16] <%Agami23> it looks like madeline is jumping on pat
[2:25:24] <moonbearbacon> up
[2:25:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> Also I take my slippers off and shake them out immediately
[2:25:28] <$velgaduere> @AnthroMetal definitely misread that for a sec
[2:25:29] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[2:25:30] <%thedankestmeeme> Pat I'm sure you already know this but you have a GOOD Fiancé to put up with that LOL
[2:25:34] <%nipplestheenchilada96> if there is a god, why did he create centipedes? they are literally just spider snakes
[2:25:38] <%HotSauceFiend> remember pat this is all mountain
[2:25:46] <+JazzyBongo> go get a burger at wind ees
[2:25:46] <marvel877> was AFK for a bit, did they kill the centipede?
[2:25:46] <%SWFanatic> I'm like that but with mosquitos in my bedroom
[2:25:46] <Sartastic> when I lived in a basement you'd turned on the lights and see little centipedes run to the baseboards
[2:25:52] <%AnthroMetal> @velgaduere oh god i just realized oh no
[2:25:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> Someone turned the fan up all the way to 11
[2:26:07] <%SWFanatic> "This is a battle I must win."
[2:26:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> @nipplestheenchilada96 he looked at spiders and snakes and said "I bet I can make something worse"
[2:26:17] <DracaenaLeaf> gl

[2:28:14] <%skizzuto> Sounds like a Celeste stream alright LUL
[2:28:27] <+JazzyBongo> fuck even a Casper mattress won't give you rest from this
[2:28:30] <WillofGame> The snow would be leaving a welt on your face at this point
[2:28:35] <Komayeda> GOnna be honest, this was kinda my least favorite level, if only cuz it succeeds in making you feel kinda frustrated
[2:28:48] <%IronOhki> Pyon Sugoi!
[2:29:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> This is intense
[2:29:56] <WillofGame> Yeah this game is tough
[2:30:03] <m1a_gunner> great soundtrack
[2:30:07] <Brandon__Brando> @Komayeda 5 think the ending of 5 was the least favorite after it turned into a escort mission
[2:30:32] <Therusher> This is still 4 right?
[2:30:42] <%RayReborne> ride the wind baby! yee haw
[2:30:42] <Brandon__Brando> ya

[2:36:05] <%Akizea> didnt 2mello do a godlike remix of this?
[2:36:19] <%Zeikier> I was quoting Pink Floyd, but interesting connection
[2:36:21] <LoneFonte> @Akizea b-side, yeah
[2:36:26] <%skizzuto> @Akizea Yup, it's the music for the B side of this level
[2:36:40] <dukenux> ...themes like Pink Floyd lyrics? Yeah, i agree
[2:36:47] <TwistParabola> thats exactly what they are
[2:37:00] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt no, but srsly, you're absolutely right
[2:37:04] <TwistParabola> its so great to be seen and validated
[2:37:32] <%SinnerEbru> its alwo nice to get actual institutional support
[2:37:32] <ExpressNode> Did I miss something deep?
[2:37:43] <ExpressNode> Stepped away to make some jimmy deans
[2:37:43] <JetpackMcQuack> I've been pushing feathers for 15 years
[2:37:45] <marvel877> At this point, you're tired.
[2:37:49] <+izanagi22> @ExpressNode Madeleine had a panic attack
[2:37:53] <retrosadness> anxiety bad
[2:37:57] <%Zeikier> being older feels like you've prolly gone even longer than others without proper acknowledgement of your stuff
[2:38:08] <TheAzureOracle> To be fair where else is there to go
[2:38:08] <TwistParabola> a what
[2:38:08] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[2:38:09] <%SirGO0SE> i live there
[2:38:11] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:38:13] <%NitronStreams> YEAH
[2:38:18] <%SWFanatic> c'est la vie
[2:38:26] <%TheWinged7> so which was worse pat, the centipede or the  strawberry goblins?
[2:38:27] <$realm_forge> WE NEED MORE KOPING SKILLS IN GAMES DAMN IT
[2:38:30] <marvel877> Pat, you were like that when Zangief was licking your feet.
[2:38:34] <+pectusumbra> DK barrels
[2:38:35] <ExpressNode> Barrels
[2:38:37] <%NitronStreams> Ride the DK barrels
[2:38:38] <%RealThiele> born to die
[2:38:39] <AurusD> i can assure you pat, you sounded far more shrill than the dialog weewoommm in this game
[2:38:48] <BigFingerRo> CLOSE ONE
[2:38:48] <dukenux> This ancient space temple in the mountain? nah, why you say so?
[2:38:48] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[2:38:49] <%TheWinged7> pat you had it, why not get another?
[2:38:55] <WebmanJax> Just get it.
[2:38:56] <+pectusumbra> lol. lamo
[2:38:56] <%ConLin_Arts_> damn you Pat
[2:38:59] <AurusD> but seriously centipedes are yikes
[2:39:08] <%zzNamttamzz> Maybe just one more
[2:39:12] <%IronOhki> @TheWinged7 I got here late, but I think the goblin approach is to ignore them.
[2:39:13] <MaybeFalco> fruit successfully avoided
[2:39:16] <%skizzuto> So you're getting over your mind goblins by just actively avoiding the strawberries?
[2:39:21] <kikoeru_san> damn he's just straight saying NO to these berries now, wha happun?
[2:39:33] <%TheWinged7> @TheWinged7 oh i know, but i also convinced him to get the first one
[2:39:42] <%RealThiele> time to leave it
[2:39:44] <+pectusumbra> and yet going for this one?
[2:39:46] <luftraumm1> so how are the goblins behaving?
[2:39:47] <%TheLemuroid> @TheWinged7 He has been encouraged to get at least one so it isn't obsessively avoiding them
[2:39:50] <%HotSauceFiend> spring reloads the dash
[2:39:53] <%Agami23> @kikoeru_san thats the point of the stream. to get over an obsession with collectables
[2:39:54] <%ConLin_Arts_> how can this be?
[2:39:56] <ExpressNode> Haven't seen a centipede in months but I now they are in here....fucking somewhere......
[2:40:06] <%NitronStreams> 👏👏👏
[2:40:28] <$velgaduere> oh no, 7! THE WEIRDEST SINGLE-DIGIT NUMBER!!
[2:40:40] <DaCheekyOne> But pat, what if you miss out on something interesting?
[2:40:45] <%pokefan9956> yeah. getting 0 is just completionism in reverse
[2:40:49] <WillofGame> You ever have to deal with roaches in Canada?
[2:40:50] <dukenux> don't
[2:40:51] <The_Legendairy> Congratulations! 👏
[2:41:03] <%NitronStreams> Welcome fractions into your life
[2:41:04] <+DigbyMayor> Overcome it King
[2:41:11] <ExpressNode> I think 3 is the weirdest number
[2:41:13] <TwistParabola> this is the part of the game where things get tricksy imo
[2:41:15] <%chance_h> It’s Pat vs mind goblins, not pat vs game
[2:41:17] <dukenux> noberries% run let's go
[2:41:18] <BigFingerRo> O
[2:41:19] <hearingthenseeing> Oh I love this level
[2:41:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> ive been waiting for this!
[2:41:25] <AoiRob> you can do a completion run later if you liked the game
[2:41:33] <Darthkitten_Prime> That's honestly really good progress Pat, congratz.
[2:41:36] <VentWilsn> more like anyberries%
[2:41:39] <$velgaduere> @ExpressNode except that 3 is the magic number. Schoolhouse Rock taught me that
[2:41:44] <dukenux> the piano music in this level vargSad
[2:41:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> haha, Pat go SPLAT!
[2:41:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> oh you're pretty far in lol
[2:41:57] <%skizzuto> Welcome to exploration, the level
[2:42:01] <LorcaNomad> some strawberry puzzles are very good trainers for mechanics
[2:42:01] <dukenux> @VentWilsn nah, you deliberately avoid all berries
[2:42:05] <hearingthenseeing> Down and up
[2:42:10] <LoneFonte> thats expected in this level
[2:42:13] <ppangboi> Sad FM
[2:42:16] <kikoeru_san> so he's only getting the ones he's wants, that's hype Pat, low key proud
[2:42:22] <Komayeda> Aha!

[2:42:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Welcome to the Berry Dimension?
[2:42:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oops, all Goblins!
[2:43:04] <%Aokaay> tutorial berries for zone I guess
[2:43:10] <dukenux> you have to get intimate with the mechanics to get many of them
[2:43:12] <dukenux> key
[2:43:17] <AoiRob> no progress only berry
[2:43:26] <+SimplyPandaz> how many mind goblins are there currently?
[2:43:29] <porkued> I would make fun of pat but I don't remember the last time I've played a game without looking at a guide at least once in order to be "optimal"
[2:43:37] <Sp3ctre48> This game looks like my nightmares of how platformers play
[2:43:38] <Komayeda> oh!
[2:43:40] <Brandon__Brando> this song reminds me of chrono trigger
[2:43:56] <%RayReborne> secret hole i spotted Kappa

[2:44:03] <+rafaelba93> missed something Kappa
[2:44:29] <%chance_h> Wow so that puzzle was literally “just give up”
[2:44:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @Gelphaze thats a dream

[2:45:40] <TwistParabola> aharrrrrg
[2:45:45] <%nipplestheenchilada96> I just googled what a house centipede looks like, that is horrifying
[2:45:48] <dukenux> HARK
[2:45:58] <+DilTinman> I remember getting all the berries and b-sides in this game. Never again
[2:46:00] <TwistParabola> MOMENTUM
[2:46:17] <dukenux> @nipplestheenchilada96 its weird, cause i think it looks cuter up close
[2:46:18] <%Mr_Pylon> It's not about filling a shelf now, it's about collecting a few special ones.
[2:46:19] <%SWFanatic> House centipede is like Rom the Vacuous
[2:46:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat voice feels low
[2:46:31] <Therusher> berry indifference, goblin slain
[2:46:39] <kikoeru_san> Sounds like you're getting the ones you want
[2:46:44] <VentWilsn> this music is so relaxing i want to take a nap

[2:47:48] <moonbearbacon> it's just to light where you've been
[2:47:50] <Therusher> Real question now is to the lights count as completion goblins too?

[2:49:07] <%IronOhki> @chatterbox5387 They were fine until the centipede.
[2:49:09] <TwistParabola> classy
[2:49:24] <Brandon__Brando> @TimetodiveLTX You should watch the Tool assisted speed run of this game its insane
[2:49:29] <%RealThiele> its unpossible
[2:49:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @chatterbox5387 he played once before, spent 4 hours on level one, then gave up. Much more progress this time
[2:49:35] <%chance_h> Yeet
[2:49:36] <ExpressNode> I don't see the resemblance at all
[2:49:47] <hearingthenseeing> Jump early
[2:49:48] <%TheWinged7> you done its
[2:49:49] <%IronOhki> Nicely gamed.

[2:51:37] <%chance_h> Jumping is so cool, I wish it was real
[2:51:58] <dukenux> Looks like you accidentaly stumbled into the Temple of Dagoth
[2:52:00] <dukenux> oops
[2:52:06] <luftraumm1> imagine someone came up with jumping
[2:52:18] <TwistParabola> thankfully the lights dont reset
[2:52:39] <%SirGO0SE> Mario invented jumping
[2:52:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nice recovery
[2:53:15] <TwistParabola> naisu
[2:54:07] <luftraumm1> I wonder if someone could actually jump like in video games,  how fast would their knees become pudding
[2:54:20] <LorcaNomad> man I fucking love this game
[2:54:28] <Brandon__Brando> thank god the goblin wasn't the death counter or you would of been fucked
[2:54:37] <%chance_h> Does moving feel more like Super meatboy or Hollow knight?
[2:54:41] <ppangboi> I'm a big fan of red bubble mechanic

[2:55:48] <%NitronStreams> EXCUSE ME
[2:55:53] <+pectusumbra> HMMMMM
[2:55:57] <ppangboi> writhing walls aren't good??
[2:55:58] <Brandon__Brando> what a great way to teach you a enemy
[2:55:58] <DusK_The_Stray> Here we go!
[2:55:59] <VentWilsn> how did they get Pat's brand into the game?

[2:57:41] <Saltmeisterr> THE HOBGOBLIN
[2:57:42] <%madmanrambler> yeah this is why I remember being sad that you bounced off this, because this game really connects with a lot of the struggles you've talked about
[2:57:43] <+pectusumbra> that's the idea yeah. The Shadow, The True Self, blahblahblah
[2:58:02] <LoneFonte> Gobeline
[2:58:12] <Brandon__Brando> thats why I found it funny you where playing this game to fight your mind golbins
[2:58:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> a ha
[2:58:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> lmfao
[2:58:34] <%madmanrambler> ehh she went through a crystal phase
[2:58:36] <TwistParabola> mario stomp the beholders
[2:58:38] <dukenux> is this a metroid
[2:58:52] <Captain0Punz> strawb
[2:58:54] <+mikesapartment> the JO crystals are clear
[2:58:54] <dukenux> Badeline is a kooky healing crystal lady
[2:59:13] <arizenarkana> Why does that thing sound like Gnome Fart?
[2:59:15] <%RayReborne> omg you dont need to break that random rock pat lol
[2:59:31] <dukenux> ohhhhh
[2:59:31] <%skizzuto> he won't charge if you're not in los
[2:59:42] <dukenux> holy shit, i didn't even knew about that strawberry
[2:59:47] <+rafaelba93> they are part of you
[2:59:50] <$velgaduere> same thing happened with Mr. Oshiro
[2:59:51] <+pectusumbra> yeah, it did the same thing with hotel guy
[2:59:56] <$Jaxnos> yeah, you can trigger them.
[2:59:59] <%RayReborne> the slowdonw happens with Oshiro too, just way less of jt
[2:59:59] <NeroInfinite> ding dong
[3:00:02] <%TheLemuroid> That's witch time
[3:00:03] <%SinnerEbru> it gives you bullet time to jump on its head
[3:00:15] <%Agami23> the slow down happened with the hotel guy too. its because madeline is a big tekken fan
[3:00:17] <+pectusumbra> also these things are very terraria-corruption to me
[3:00:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> AT Field
[3:00:34] <%TheWinged7> ssri?
[3:00:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> wow

[3:01:35] <Brandon__Brando> damn
[3:01:35] <%IronOhki> That's unfortunate.
[3:01:36] <VentWilsn> good luck with the mind goblins, Pat!
[3:01:38] <+MrSuplexArt> hell yeah they do
[3:01:42] <%RayReborne> oh yeah the anti nut medicine Kappa
[3:01:42] <bigb00gi3> wasn't expecting fun facts with pasta rat
[3:01:42] <sydowoodo> speaking from experience???
[3:01:42] <%Deft_Thought> psaBougie I say
[3:01:42] <%twohitgood> SSRI's also tend to have poweful side effects
[3:01:43] <dukenux> Damn
[3:01:43] <%Maids4lyfe> I can attest
[3:01:44] <%cvp5127> not worth it
[3:01:45] <%SWFanatic> very safe medications
[3:01:47] <%Monkeyweed21> getting off it feels FUCKIN weird
[3:01:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Great for you precum people
[3:01:48] <%vivaldiva> oh boy does it
[3:01:51] <%HeroToxiko> With 2 s's for a double dose of STAMINA

[3:01:53] <dan_g_v> education!!
[3:01:58] <%chance_h> Celest can’t nut, gotcha
[3:02:01] <%IronOhki> @TimetodiveLTX I have always translated his name in my brain as David Hater.
[3:02:01] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:02:01] <GreySleevesStinkBat> The more you know ~
[3:02:07] <dukenux> like finishing, or starting?
[3:02:07] <NeroInfinite> so your telling me SSRIs are the drug version of a cock cage?
[3:02:11] <%mai_waifu_> It's only like 45 min to nut nbd
[3:02:15] <LysdexicAndVolingit> As someone on SSRIs; I'll take frustratingly difficult orgasms over the mind goblins!
[3:02:17] <%Sotetsu> Wouldn't that just increase the depression?
[3:02:20] <%mai_waifu_> Kreygasm
[3:02:22] <+pectusumbra> NO
[3:02:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> no
[3:02:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> How apt, we ARE approaching NoNut November
[3:02:38] <%SWFanatic> @dukenux can be either, some have decreased libido
[3:02:40] <$velgaduere> I'm pretty sure people who wear cock cages get off on wearing cock cages
[3:02:41] <+JonathLP> But if I wanted the drug version a cock cage, what would it be? Hypothetically
[3:02:41] <%Monkeyweed21> they're NNN pills
[3:02:42] <%notsoy> no, the cock cage is just a side effect
[3:02:48] <$velgaduere> SSRIs make the getting off part hard
[3:02:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Measurehead would LOVE SSRIs
[3:03:01] <%trackles_64> I could of gotten this OST on vinyl so mad i didnt
[3:03:03] <+Redpointshine> Erectile Dysfunction tablets
[3:03:10] <+Slim_Filthy> @JonathLP HRT, shrinkage included LUL
[3:03:10] <+Redpointshine> ANTI-Viagra
[3:03:11] <%silvery_cricket> Just got to that part on Inscryption where it tries going through your hard drive
[3:03:21] <NeroInfinite> the wnati viagra
[3:03:21] <%silvery_cricket> FUCK that
[3:03:26] <+MrSuplexArt> you can get off, it just takes a good effort and time
[3:03:28] <dukenux> @SWFanatic that's unfortunate(or the opposite, for early comers)
[3:03:33] <NeroInfinite> anti rather.
[3:03:34] <$realm_forge> Normies won’t get it, but the benefits outweigh the downsides by far
[3:03:36] <churropoppa> That's why you try out several SSRIs to see which affects you the best6
[3:04:10] <Shwepie> My SSRIs stopped working, it sucks.
[3:04:10] <+Thekirby8u> teenL
[3:04:11] <$velgaduere> Theo JO'd himself right into a crystal. the final form of those who use them
[3:04:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> SSRI's are for premature ejaculators Kappa /s Get well people
[3:04:28] <Parapattern> "I wonder how much air is in here?"
[3:04:30] <AurusD> sometimes chastity is done specifically to make people pent up, but the impacts are somewhat similar? being in long-term chastity makes it difficult to get hard, but SSRIs don't stop that (in my experience) they just mean it takes a lot more to cum. there's maybe some decrease in sensitivity too but idk about that
[3:04:35] <+MrSuplexArt> however, if you stop SSRIs suddenly, like you run out, you end up nutting in 30 seconds
[3:04:37] <Therusher> @silvery_cricket please try to avoid spoilers, that game is under a week old :(
[3:04:38] <%TheLemuroid> The JO crystals are from Theo
[3:04:44] <+MrSuplexArt> and that sucks
[3:04:44] <%SWFanatic> @dukenux like many therapies it comes down to weighing the pros and cons. For people with severe depression it can save their lives.
[3:04:45] <%madmanrambler> I'm such a sucker for 'person is going through their own silent hill'
[3:04:45] <+Dakuu75> aaawwwwww
[3:05:02] <TheTakkster> Theo knows he needs eyes on him
[3:05:03] <%NitronStreams> we have our own Goblins
[3:05:18] <%Sotetsu> I'm glad this game immortalized"Yolo"
[3:05:24] <Hyphen_Sum> I'm sorry what is chat on  about
[3:05:25] <%madmanrambler> ole!
[3:05:37] <%Monkeyweed21> oh god does Theo have the same eyeball gimmick as Pat
[3:05:39] <%Th0ms0nStuart> Just got here, what conversation did I stumble upon...
[3:05:42] <AurusD> is it weird that SSRI was the first thing my doctor tried
[3:05:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Hoogidy boogidy
[3:05:52] <%ElkRiverDog> So, is this like a platformer Silent Hill?
[3:06:05] <%SWFanatic> @AurusD No, its a very commonly prescribed medication
[3:06:08] <AurusD> y'all have me doubting everything lmao
[3:06:10] <%madmanrambler> little bit yeah
[3:06:11] <%trackles_64> fucky wucky the medical term
[3:06:14] <@goose_attack_almanac> With the whole "Giving yourself psuedo-tourettes" thing going on with the tiktok people through group awareness and misguided perception
[3:06:16] <$velgaduere> they were also the first thing mine tried and I could not deal with the side-effects lmao
[3:06:23] <@goose_attack_almanac> Does that mean people can infact give JO crystals power
[3:06:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Apparently, according to the specialist, expecting equal good an bad from life if Sever depression
[3:06:27] <+MrSuplexArt> some can also help with anxiety, when balanced with a different med
[3:06:30] <Therusher> I think it was the 2nd or so I got, it's not super uncommon
[3:06:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> is*
[3:06:36] <TwistParabola> the strawberry though
[3:06:36] <%Monkeyweed21> SSRI's are the anti depressant nuclear option
[3:06:42] <+Thekirby8u> wh
[3:06:46] <%baka_sugoi> JO?
[3:06:47] <%TimetodiveLTX> hell yeah
[3:06:47] <+Redpointshine> GET THE FUCKING STRAWBERRY PAT
[3:06:48] <+Slim_Filthy> "Sir, I've diagnosed you as, ehhh" *waves hand sideways*
[3:06:50] <%madmanrambler> as it turns out placebo is the real strongest medicine
[3:06:51] <dukenux> what the hell is a Jay Oh
[3:06:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Never forget that Placebo is Diet Real
[3:06:57] <$TheSmerdis> Placebo is a hell of a drug
[3:06:57] <hearingthenseeing> Remember Jerry, it's not a lie if you believe it.
[3:06:58] <%TimetodiveLTX> @Redpointshine mods
[3:06:59] <%nipplestheenchilada96> PLACEBOOOOOOO
[3:07:11] <@goose_attack_almanac> @dukenux magic crystal to help you nut with your bros
[3:07:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Jack Off= JO
[3:07:15] <Therusher> diet real is the best description I've ever heard for that
[3:07:18] <%JoshManVGH> Uh oh. .
[3:07:20] <%Bluwizard21> Chargin my crystal
[3:07:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> lol chat doesn't know what JO'ing is
[3:07:28] <hearingthenseeing> my sweet summer child
[3:07:30] <%madmanrambler> slay that mind beholder
[3:07:31] <%IronOhki> Rofal, lamaow
[3:07:32] <NeroInfinite> it's a crystla you put up your butt
[3:07:33] <%SinnerEbru> JO crystal is a great copypasta
[3:07:33] <Brandon__Brando> @GeneralSCPatton your so right I hate it\
[3:07:35] <wqorst> like a chaos emerald right
[3:07:36] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt What do when maximum dose of SSRI stops working?
[3:07:37] <AurusD> Jack O'lantern crystal. it's spooky month after all Kappa
[3:07:37] <%silvery_cricket> JO means John Osmind the inventor of crystal jerk off sessions
[3:07:40] <%JoshManVGH> Look up JO Crystal Game Grumps, it's  a trip
[3:07:41] <+pectusumbra> new age crystals that supposedly get energy from masturbating
[3:07:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> @wqorst yeah
[3:07:55] <%Mr_Pylon> is that when you nut a kidney stone out?
[3:07:55] <dukenux> @goose_attack_almanac are you suppose to show it up your butt, or does it "work" like all the other crystals
[3:07:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Shwepie try a different one
[3:08:01] <dukenux> *shove
[3:08:14] <%demiiluna> Does Pat know about any of the secret moves
[3:08:16] <%SWFanatic> @Monkeyweed21 SSRIs are commonly prescribed as a 1st line therapy for depression. Medically resistant severe depression Electroconvulsive therapy is very effective but not widely available.
[3:08:19] <%madmanrambler> depends on who's trying to sell it to you I imagine
[3:08:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "It just works" - JO Crystal enthusiast
[3:08:31] <@goose_attack_almanac> @dukenux you typically wear it around your neck while you "charge it"
[3:08:34] <%IronOhki> Oh great, I just looked up what a JO crystal is. Thank you, Google, for explaining it to me.
[3:08:38] <%TimetodiveLTX> secret moves more like your mom
[3:08:41] <%TimetodiveLTX> i fucked your mother
[3:08:45] <%IronOhki> "with a bro."
[3:08:46] <@goose_attack_almanac> JO Crystals: When Shungite isn't enough.
[3:08:48] <TwistParabola> i like the whispering in this track
[3:08:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @SWFanatic are they STILL trying to make electroconvulsive therapy work?
[3:08:55] <%TimetodiveLTX> with a bro
[3:08:59] <dukenux> @goose_attack_almanac neck is not where i'd imagine you suppose to wear it
[3:09:06] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:09:37] <%Deft_Thought> This game seems really cool
[3:09:43] <%SWFanatic> @Monkeyweed21 It actually works very well in patients that don't respond to medication. Lots of studies support it.
[3:09:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> fuckin' flying Mike Wazowski over here
[3:09:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Monkeyweed21 brains are just electric meat, why wouldn't it work
[3:09:54] <%Deft_Thought> I'm not as into puzzle platformers as I was when I was younger, but I like it
[3:09:58] <Brandon__Brando> omg the J.O Crystal is amazing
[3:10:05] <dukenux> i missed out by playing this with shitty speakers the first time
[3:10:07] <%madmanrambler> its really nice that you get to mario jump on your depression even if it only works for a short period of time
[3:10:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> @dukenux can't tell your bros you probed the depths with your JO crystal. Gotta touch crystal tips which is totally straight.
[3:10:11] <dukenux> didn't hear the creepy whispers
[3:10:27] <AurusD> of course my thing is "is my depression a result of reasonable real-life stuff, is it just anxiety, is it because I'm not being healthy enough, or am I actually depressed"
[3:11:01] <%IronOhki> Pat so smart
[3:11:06] <%IronOhki> Oh good! Eyes!
[3:11:20] <dukenux> GRANT US EYES
[3:11:21] <%IronOhki> Need some eyes on the inside.
[3:11:33] <AurusD> also pat (and chat), thank you for talking so openly about all this stuff, it's... really refreshing tbh
[3:11:42] <+JustToWatch> oh no Theo got stuck in a JO crystal
[3:11:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Show me some bobs"
[3:11:59] <%TheLemuroid> There's a lot of tech you can do by dashing into the crystal and and grabbing right after throwing it
[3:12:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Theo is a Sentient JO Crystal
[3:12:06] <TwistParabola> LUL
[3:12:07] <%NitronStreams> Big and STRONG
[3:12:07] <hearingthenseeing> Theo is great
[3:12:11] <%RayReborne> BIG AND STRONG
[3:12:16] <%twohitgood> it's all that climbing
[3:12:17] <%madmanrambler> it's a shame silent hill is dead because the idea of a couple of near modern teens having to have fun conversation like this while dealing with the demons and such is very funny
[3:12:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> I mean, she has been climbing those sheer rock walls
[3:12:18] <%SWFanatic> @AurusD If you feel like it is intefering with your life, its not just normal adult stuff.
[3:12:19] <Parapattern> That is a full ass man in a giant crystal
[3:12:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm loving the dichotomy of vulnerable real talk and JO crystals
[3:12:20] <$velgaduere> Madeline's no stranger to the crystals, I see
[3:12:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> @TheLemuroid i'm interested
[3:12:20] <lloyddboy> HE IS THE BALL
[3:12:22] <%twistedj3ster> oh, I just beat Inscryption...I think
[3:12:23] <%Mr_Pylon> hell yeah big and strong!
[3:12:24] <%madmanrambler> well she has been free climbing for like 5 levels
[3:12:26] <%MechArch> looks like you're enjoying yourself
[3:12:33] <%Bluwizard21> god theo is so enabling
[3:12:34] <Brandon__Brando> @AurusD thats for a therapists to find out think of it like a normal doctor check up
[3:12:43] <i_chevalier> @reallybigrocks the same reason why you cant just take an electric shock, it cause trauma to the brain and the nerve system. You are cause a lot of damage for no results.
[3:12:59] <%chance_h> If u can double jump, lifting twice your body weight is less of a problem
[3:13:00] <hearingthenseeing> You can use Theo to press buttons
[3:13:01] <%TheLemuroid> You can also press switches with the crystal
[3:13:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @i_chevalier just use less electricity
[3:13:17] <%TheLemuroid> @TheLemuroid Speedruns of this game are great
[3:13:29] <Brandon__Brando> I was stuck here for so long
[3:13:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> waht the fuck just happened
[3:13:57] <%Bluwizard21> nice juke
[3:14:01] <TwistParabola> Tool assisted speedruns of this game are amazing, particularly for this level
[3:14:02] <%SharkMissile> Sick juke
[3:14:23] <%Monkeyweed21> THEO DID IT FOR THE VINE
[3:14:26] <%RetroCop87> THEO. GODDAMNT. GODDAMNIT. GODDAMNIT.
[3:14:30] <%SharkMissile> @TwistParabola Yeah! Isn't this the level where you can just go through entire screens in one frame?
[3:14:31] <TwistParabola> gamer
[3:14:33] <$velgaduere> styled on
[3:14:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Anti-Theo Dimension
[3:14:37] <%madmanrambler> listen we don't ask people why they have their strange very absurd personal silent hill hang ups
[3:14:38] <%madmanrambler> its rude
[3:14:43] <TwistParabola> @SharkMissile sure is
[3:15:02] <Darthkitten_Prime> ?
[3:15:02] <ThanksVideogames9> ITCH
[3:15:02] <%IronOhki> Wuh happun?
[3:15:03] <sydowoodo> what now
[3:15:05] <i_chevalier> @reallybigrocks We are a chemical base lifeform, not an energy based lifeform. less eletricty iant going to work
[3:15:08] <marvel877> ITS BLUD
[3:15:09] <%shurtal> elmo hair from CROSS COURT
[3:15:13] <TwistParabola> theo, pat is alergic to self-flattery
[3:15:13] <%Canti510> Did you stifle a sneeze?
[3:15:14] <%MooseIsGoose> did the centipede go up your nose
[3:15:15] <%SharkMissile> @madmanrambler That's very polite, I like your policy.
[3:15:16] <%IronOhki> Got it
[3:15:16] <$velgaduere> one of the goblins tried to escape through his nose
[3:15:22] <Darthkitten_Prime> Ah, yeah I get it
[3:15:26] <%RetroCop87> ... AND YOU GET THAT FULL BODY TWITCH?
[3:15:30] <%MegadBlitz> just don't die
[3:15:42] <%TimetodiveLTX> niiiiiiiiice that took me so long
[3:15:50] <Brandon__Brando> I love theo
[3:15:59] <%Sotetsu> The goblins are attacking his nose! psaGoblin
[3:16:00] <lloyddboy> YEET THE BOY
[3:16:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I want the crystal to break and he gets splattered or impaled on a spike
[3:16:10] <%IronOhki> YEET THE BOY
[3:16:15] <%Deft_Thought> I do not like these eyes
[3:16:31] <%IronOhki> Oh god oh jeez
[3:16:31] <%MegadBlitz> oh look it's us
[3:16:39] <%IronOhki> NICE
[3:16:52] <AurusD> do the eyes represent paranoia
[3:16:55] <Bamcrash> Notice that the eyes are looking at Theo, not Madeline
[3:16:56] <%IronOhki> @Deft_Thought No one likes these eyes
[3:16:57] <i_chevalier> @deft_thought the eyes follow onlyntheo
[3:17:02] <%RetroCop87> I like to imagine Pat has a lot of trouble dodging the sun in SMB3
[3:17:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> lmfao
[3:17:04] <TwistParabola> lmao
[3:17:07] <AurusD> or maybe it's the inward looking judgey eyes
[3:17:10] <%Deft_Thought> Yeesh
[3:17:18] <dukenux> imagine, hundreds pair of eyes watching you going through this
[3:17:19] <%madmanrambler> I think the eyes represent theo's need and also frustration at being constanly observed and compared
[3:17:21] <dukenux> just imagine
[3:17:36] <Brandon__Brando> nice the soical media nut has eyes all looking at him as his troubles
[3:17:48] <TwistParabola> the juuuukes
[3:17:48] <%Sotetsu> Poor Theo
[3:17:49] <%SharkMissile> pogClap
[3:17:50] <%baka_sugoi> skill
[3:17:51] <%madmanrambler> I think he mentions earlier in the game that he feels constantly compared to his sister as well
[3:17:56] <%MechArch> gg
[3:18:00] <%Monkeyweed21> pat has become pirate
[3:18:01] <AurusD> not gonna lie that was impressive as hell
[3:18:07] <%baka_sugoi> EYE
[3:18:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> This stage really matches Pats channel branding
[3:18:11] <%IronOhki> OH HEY
[3:18:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ded
[3:18:13] <Therusher> I def didn't realize the theo stuff on my playthrough, that's pretty neat
[3:18:14] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[3:18:15] <@QueequegTheater> wutFace
[3:18:18] <%Deft_Thought> What a cool game
[3:18:18] <%IronOhki> Theo loves selfies, and has eyes all over the place.
[3:18:18] <%madmanrambler> love that art
[3:18:20] <$velgaduere> look at her go
[3:18:23] <hearingthenseeing> Theo did it!
[3:18:23] <%skizzuto> I love the level clear theme, it's so soothing
[3:18:23] <+izanagi22> LUL
[3:18:23] <%SinnerEbru> ya did it!!!
[3:18:23] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT DEFEATED HIMSELF
[3:18:26] <%SWFanatic> BERRY UP
[3:18:26] <%RayReborne> EFFORT
[3:18:29] <%Deft_Thought> Short and stronk
[3:18:30] <+Thekirby8u> yoo 5 strawbs
[3:18:30] <NeroInfinite> 119
[3:18:32] <+izanagi22> I really like this segmetn
[3:18:32] <+balouie> why does so much stuff in her head want to kill her
[3:18:32] <%madmanrambler> alright now go in and die one more time to check that off
[3:18:34] <%MegadBlitz> now throw them off the cliff
[3:18:35] <Brandon__Brando> I hate how fast your beating this LUL
[3:18:36] <TwistParabola> oh hey less than 119 deaths
[3:18:36] <NeroInfinite> berries that is
[3:18:37] <%madmanrambler> and get 120
[3:18:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> this is so cool
[3:18:39] <redwidow1358> Madeline is a high tier girl
[3:18:39] <BigFingerRo> How's DaPatters doing? I went off for something to eat
[3:18:48] <Hyphen_Sum> Doing good Pat
[3:18:52] <%madmanrambler> actually pretty close to the end
[3:18:53] <%Sotetsu> Pat stares at a big eye
[3:18:54] <WebmanJax> FTL would do it.
[3:19:00] <%trackles_64> Do it then pat
[3:19:01] <AurusD> I guess I need to buy Celeste now, rip
[3:19:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Why in our universe, is impossible?
[3:19:06] <%TheLemuroid> Fun fact this next stage has ZERO strawberries
[3:19:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> which*
[3:19:11] <%SovPho> Fun fact, you can't move faster than light because light has a variable velocity that changes when you exceed it
[3:19:11] <Therusher> But if you move faster than light you no longer have a reflection to outrun
[3:19:12] <%asgard147> but can you outrun the darkness Pat?
[3:19:18] <%trackles_64> when has anyone done that?
[3:19:25] <medril07> they had eyes on the inside
[3:19:37] <%RayReborne> why make Theo Southern all of a sudden? Kappa
[3:19:49] <Saltmeisterr> Ye
[3:19:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fun fact, from your human eyes perspective; if you moved at the speed of light, your target would visually move away from you
[3:20:01] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[3:20:09] <%RayReborne> me amd my big mouth LUL
[3:20:10] <$velgaduere> oh no, Theo got Alphys'd
[3:20:12] <Dave_VD> Did the vod of the last dishonored stream get deleted? I wanted to watch the Daud fight
[3:20:14] <+JustToWatch> oh no he's doubling down
[3:20:14] <dreadedcthulhu> ah yes, seattle, classic example of a souothern city
[3:20:16] <dreadedcthulhu> southern*
[3:20:17] <WebmanJax> Aren't they Canadian?
[3:20:19] <%SWFanatic> oh its alphys
[3:20:19] <BigFingerRo> what's with the southern accent all of a sudden?
[3:20:20] <AurusD> well, you could probably outrun your reflection if you were moving really fast and there was a medium between you and the mirror that had a very high refractive index / slowed light down a lot
[3:20:20] <%twistedj3ster> oh no the Alphys is leaking
[3:20:22] <%IronOhki> Seattle boy is developing a Texas accent, because the united states is basically just Texas.
[3:20:25] <Brandon__Brando> Fuck it make it deeper
[3:20:25] <TwistParabola> eevee part
[3:20:26] <i_chevalier> make him italian instead
[3:20:28] <dukenux> Eevee part
[3:20:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> @ChrisPlaysThing Wrong, the distance would shrink
[3:20:33] <%NitronStreams> Believe in the Theo that believes in you
[3:20:35] <redwidow1358> Eaby part
[3:20:36] <%zzNamttamzz> Now we're all Southern
[3:20:44] <BigFingerRo> Why so trsut?
[3:20:45] <%DXLelouch24> Pat none of these characters are southern
[3:20:53] <%HeroToxiko> Nakama (sister)
[3:20:56] <Brandon__Brando> @Dave_VD that was off stream
[3:21:01] <%IronOhki> THAT'S NOT WHAT LITERAL MEANS
[3:21:05] <%DXLelouch24> I would know as i am southern
[3:21:06] <%baka_sugoi> lol
[3:21:13] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[3:21:13] <dukenux> he's one of these fuckers that kept using "litteraly" wrong
[3:21:20] <%trackles_64> lmao
[3:21:31] <%madmanrambler> literally has turned into punctuation in casual conversation
[3:21:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @GeneralSCPatton  *** give it a watch
[3:21:44] <%Bluwizard21> captain kirk is climbing a mountain, why is he climbin a mountain?
[3:21:44] <%Maids4lyfe> I can't believe he would literally use literally wrong, literally unbelievable
[3:21:51] <%Sotetsu> @ironohki I literally I agree with you.
[3:21:55] <%RetroCop87> PAT RELATES
[3:21:56] <%Bluwizard21> we all do that
[3:21:58] <%notsoy> GOBBOS
[3:22:00] <%templar010> too real

[3:22:13] <+izanagi22> Representation!
[3:22:13] <%madmanrambler> its a very real struggle, and now the game is validating Pat

[3:22:37] <$velgaduere> oh you're right I should relive that RIGHT NOW
[3:22:39] <+JonathLP> Don't worry Pat. We remember for you. And we still judge you.
[3:22:39] <%Bluwizard21> that girl might just have been fliting
[3:22:39] <$ImExtremelyManly> fuck those thoughts
[3:22:40] <lloyddboy> SURPASS YOUR CRINGE
[3:22:41] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU SAID SOMETHING MEAN TO A GIRL BY ACCIDENT
[3:22:42] <BumblyMako> got sucked because of good platformer, and get hooked because it's too gosh darn relatable
[3:22:43] <%Ne1son> What about it?
[3:22:43] <JetpackMcQuack> insomnia it is
[3:22:46] <%ElkRiverDog> Video game stop calling me out
[3:22:49] <Brandon__Brando> mines a little more extreme but ya
[3:22:50] <%twistedj3ster> that's when you hug dog
[3:22:51] <%IronOhki> Pat, how did you ever become an internetman if you anxiety about one embarrassing thing?
[3:22:54] <+Deosier> that's rough buddy
[3:22:55] <%Deft_Thought> What about that time your friend said they weren't gonna do anything that evening and later you saw a photo of them out at a party omg they must HATE YOU
[3:23:04] <AurusD> I mean at least nothing I do in the future will ever be as cringe-inducing as the stuff I did in high school
[3:23:04] <i_chevalier> Isnt all you do is make embrassing statments. it like your brand???
[3:23:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> 'the truth is i'm barely holding it together'

[3:23:20] <%notsoy> lmfaoooooo
[3:23:22] <%RayReborne> OH NO, REDDIT!
[3:23:22] <%IronOhki> Pat Attacked!
[3:23:22] <tanarath> OH NO
[3:23:23] <WebmanJax> Is streaming exposure therapy for the "embarrassing thing you did" goblin?
[3:23:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow, thats like the worst solution
[3:23:24] <+JonathLP> THE WORST COMBO
[3:23:24] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[3:23:25] <%Monkeyweed21> OH NO IT US
[3:23:26] <RaidenRising> OOF
[3:23:29] <%Deft_Thought> IS PAT THE CELESTE

[3:23:40] <%asgard147> too real
[3:23:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BOY IS IT
[3:23:45] <+izanagi22> 100%, can confirm
[3:23:46] <+JustToWatch> THE MAD ONLINE PART THOUGH
[3:23:49] <dukenux> Like in that recent Mads Mikkelsen movie
[3:23:53] <tanarath> Is young Pat the Celeste?
[3:23:54] <%Agami23> wait, i thought madeline was a kid this whole time
[3:23:54] <%Sotetsu> Oh noooooo
[3:23:57] <+mikesapartment> i dunno im drinking right now and my confidence is maxed out
[3:23:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just never do an alcohol
[3:24:04] <BluebunRose> I dont drink but I do get mad at ppl on the internet all the time XD
[3:24:12] <Therusher> I love how Madeline seems so relatable and well-made despite only having like, 8-10 dialog sections, the writing is really good.
[3:24:14] <%TimetodiveLTX> @Agami23 adults are just bigger children
[3:24:15] <%IronOhki> BEARD
[3:24:15] <%Bluwizard21> i do all the alcohol, but mostly cause im bored.
[3:24:19] <$ashenfrenzy> aw thats cute
[3:24:20] <%madmanrambler> look at this platonic friendship
[3:24:21] <%DXLelouch24> @agami23 you thought a child was climbing a Mountain?!
[3:24:21] <%Sotetsu> What's the slowest way to alcoholism?
[3:24:22] <%NitronStreams> Adorb
[3:24:22] <%madmanrambler> friggin cut
[3:24:23] <%madmanrambler> e
[3:24:24] <+izanagi22> Awww. They actually have a nice description of depression
[3:24:25] <dukenux> you say that, but when i'm drunk drinking seems like a very good idea
[3:24:26] <%MechArch> oh no im doing an alochol rn
[3:24:28] <aura_00> aww man, i like the dialog :(
[3:24:33] <BumblyMako> Do alcohol but only in a good headspace means I never drink alcohol
[3:24:41] <%MelBrooksKA> His beard looks really comfy
[3:24:42] <%IronOhki> @Bluwizard21 Fuck I know that feel. I'm trying not to drink tonight simply because I'm super bored.
[3:24:47] <%Deft_Thought> They must be smelly
[3:24:49] <%Sotetsu> So cute
[3:24:52] <%Agami23> @DXLelouch24 yes, its a video game
[3:24:53] <sydowoodo> not even the mind goblins???
[3:24:54] <%Bluwizard21> @Sotetsu social drinking when you a hermit
[3:24:55] <%IronOhki> @MelBrooksKA I could snuggle it.
[3:25:07] <neroforte177> i like the dialogue cuz yore saying it
[3:25:08] <%madmanrambler> yeah sometimes it doesn't click. I personally enjoyed the grandma chatting more then theo
[3:25:12] <%SirGO0SE> same tbh
[3:25:13] <%TheLemuroid> I agree. It's the soundtrack that hits me more
[3:25:13] <ShawnEXE> That's fair, most people find the dialogue to be divisive in terms of what it contributes to the game
[3:25:18] <%TheLemuroid> And the mechanics
[3:25:26] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:25:30] <%dalmek> so I did this part like a freak by moving with the D-pad and quickly switching to analog for the feathers
[3:25:30] <%baka_sugoi> oooo
[3:25:33] <%madmanrambler> YEEEEE BIG DROP
[3:25:36] <%IronOhki> That's a feel.
[3:25:38] <dukenux> @madmanrambler same tbh
[3:25:38] <medril07> This is a great scene
[3:25:40] <BumblyMako> The game's so good that it's fair to want to skip through the dialogue
[3:25:42] <%Agami23> @DXLelouch24 also, the youngest person to reach the top of mount Everest was 13. kids can mountain climb
[3:25:51] <Brandon__Brando> that sucks I loved all the dialogue
[3:25:52] <dukenux> i also enjoyed Badeline talks more
[3:25:54] <marvel877> AURORA BOREALIS?
[3:25:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> isn't that ctrl
[3:26:00] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[3:26:01] <Shwepie> Your strawberry collecting goblin is mad it isn't getting its way, so it's sabotaging your emotions.
[3:26:02] <Komayeda> okay Pat, I disagree tho
[3:26:06] <%TimetodiveLTX> there's a button for that
[3:26:07] <medril07> She tries to deal with her the wrong way
[3:26:08] <NeroInfinite> Big drop or big shot
[3:26:11] <%MechArch> music is great tho
[3:26:13] <JetpackMcQuack> it is not subtle, this is true
[3:26:14] <+izanagi22> The problem is it isn't obvious for people who aren't used to this stuff
[3:26:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> in the pause menu
[3:26:20] <@QueequegTheater> FeelsSadMan
[3:26:23] <$velgaduere> purple, the color of the poisons
[3:26:25] <TwistParabola> wow madeline
[3:26:27] <DomunDomunDomun> aah ahh aaaahhh
[3:26:27] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU ARE CRINGE BADELINE
[3:26:30] <%Sotetsu> :(
[3:26:34] <%baka_sugoi> STEAMED HAMS
[3:26:37] <dukenux> AW SHIT
[3:26:38] <Komayeda> OH SHIT!
[3:26:38] <%MegadBlitz> purple is cool though
[3:26:40] <%trackles_64> oh oh
[3:26:42] <wqorst> whoa chill
[3:26:42] <mandorlalmond> oh shit boai
[3:26:45] <dukenux> "YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE??"
[3:26:45] <%SinnerEbru> i think its the thing where when you've dealt with it for decades, 101 talk feels trite
[3:26:48] <%JoshManVGH> I like the climbing out of the talky frame
[3:26:50] <Wolfstriker121> oh damn!!
[3:26:54] <NeroInfinite> Ah I saw this in a hentai before
[3:26:57] <%MegadBlitz> now THIS is the color of evil
[3:26:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Sometimes their talking sounds like a farting noise
[3:27:03] <%TheLemuroid> Now for the most important part about the feather lesson
[3:27:10] <Sp3ctre48> "Circles violently around you"
[3:27:25] <Komayeda> JUDGEMENT CUT!
[3:27:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck your stupid feather
[3:27:32] <%chance_h> Fighting mind goblins take up too much of your emotional capacity to care about the mundane character relationship
[3:27:37] <%baka_sugoi> oh no
[3:27:39] <%trackles_64> lvl 1 reset?
[3:27:39] <TwistParabola> FALLINNGGGGGG
[3:27:39] <+izanagi22> I do like that the game says coping skills isn't everything
[3:27:41] <dukenux> D:
[3:27:48] <NeroInfinite> back down to shit peak you go
[3:27:48] <redwidow1358> RIP

[3:28:07] <%baka_sugoi> THAT A BIIG FALL
[3:28:07] <%Sotetsu> I guess that isn't surprising. You didn't like Kenny, either.
[3:28:08] <+Thekirby8u> tough backpack
[3:28:10] <%TheLemuroid> Like I said before ZERO strawberries
[3:28:11] <%SharkMissile> Now you're actually *below* where you started
[3:28:12] <%trackles_64> goodthing you speed run earlier
[3:28:12] <%Deft_Thought> She's explode the minute she hit that water
[3:28:12] <%IronOhki> Oh look a thwamp

[3:28:17] <%SharkMissile> Way to climb, NERD
[3:28:17] <%RayReborne> FAVORITE TRACK
[3:28:19] <BumblyMako> I do like the tradeoff where you must confront your inner demons but get to not die
[3:28:23] <i_chevalier> So basicly rock bottom
[3:28:24] <ShawnEXE> Everyone knows falling in water always saves you in video games
[3:28:25] <dukenux> these things LUL
[3:28:27] <@QueequegTheater> WORT WORT WORT
[3:28:27] <%ZephynM> Ngl, this game be pretty but the pixel style is hecking up my eyes.

[3:28:31] <TwistParabola> wow pat learns fast
[3:28:31] <HyperionXV> Time for the kevin blocks
[3:28:33] <%chance_h> It’s a hellivator from terraria
[3:28:34] <JetpackMcQuack> so angry
[3:28:37] <Komayeda> Love the Block Guy
[3:28:37] <Brandon__Brando> I do like how breathing isnt the end all solution to the problem ans she tells you to fuck off with that
[3:28:37] <%JoshManVGH> Work work
[3:28:42] <TwistParabola> he learned that shit really quickly
[3:28:42] <%SinnerEbru> LUL

[3:28:43] <+Thekirby8u> ablabalablabal
[3:28:43] <+Slim_Filthy> Love the grumpy block noises
[3:28:45] <$velgaduere> I just like making the funny whomp man say "argahrghagrhagrhagrh"
[3:29:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> it really is close to the Halo 1 elite sound isn't it
[3:29:18] <+izanagi22> This thing sounds like a Mind Goblin
[3:29:28] <%madmanrambler> I would love to hear the outtakes to make his noises
[3:29:40] <+pectusumbra> put it on the board, you CANNOT pet the dog-block in celest
[3:29:44] <TwistParabola> F
[3:29:46] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:29:47] <BumblyMako> Have you done any B-sides or plan to?
[3:29:57] <NeroInfinite> snatching deafeat fromt he jaws of victory
[3:30:07] <%DXLelouch24> At this point fuck may as well be Pats catch phrase
[3:30:50] <JetpackMcQuack> one of those rooms that gives me shivers
[3:31:01] <dukenux> i really like block guys, but i also feel like they don't mesh with the supposed mood
[3:31:12] <%IronOhki> FUCK. I've been saying "oopsy-doodle" all over the place and I think it's stupid. I must have picked it up from Pat and never noticed.
[3:31:28] <$velgaduere> I also felt this
[3:31:31] <%SovPho> Catharcism?
[3:31:39] <%Sotetsu> Oopsy-doodle is super manly
[3:32:13] <%SharkMissile> Shutup Flanders! psaBlep
[3:32:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:32:14] <%JoshManVGH> What do the blocks represent, psychologically?
[3:32:22] <JetpackMcQuack> ResidentSleeper wharblegarble
[3:32:34] <%madmanrambler> that dogs are grumpy and cute
[3:32:34] <BumblyMako> @JoshManVGH Stubbornness
[3:32:37] <%DXLelouch24> Frustration?
[3:32:41] <Komayeda> The blocks don't need to represent anything, they're just funnee lil guys
[3:32:42] <@ssjklyco> That sounds like when you are making noises at zangief
[3:32:44] <NeroInfinite> sometimes a block is a block
[3:32:49] <BumblyMako> @JoshManVGH Resiliency?
[3:32:52] <dukenux> the desire to sleep over your problems?
[3:32:53] <+Thekirby8u> intrusive thoughts
[3:32:57] <+Thekirby8u> ?
[3:33:04] <dukenux> i mean, they appear really pissed you woke them
[3:33:06] <TwistParabola> they represent the desire for tetris or minecraft
[3:33:13] <+pectusumbra> Chat. The asnwer is always chest
[3:33:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> they represent a fun and interesting video game mechanic
[3:33:18] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:33:29] <%IronOhki> They represent your latent Thwomp fetish.
[3:33:37] <%JoshManVGH> like an inability to cope with surprises?
[3:33:43] <BumblyMako> I want direct mental health allegories for game mechanics
[3:33:55] <dukenux> o_o
[3:33:56] <%madmanrambler> the fuck you mean 'latent'? now get in the thwomp costume and crush me
[3:33:56] <NeroInfinite> People in chat over analyzing the blocks, meanwhile most people "It's a block it go woosh and make funny sound."
[3:34:05] <%JoshManVGH> @ironohki How did they know!?
[3:34:05] <%NitronStreams> and now Pinball
[3:34:09] <dukenux> man, i love pinball mechanic
[3:34:13] <dukenux> feels so good
[3:34:22] <%Monkeyweed21> they represent the desire to bash your head against a brick for 4 hours getting every strawberry in level 1
[3:34:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> *bink dink*
[3:34:33] <BumblyMako> Then, the pinballs are rejection. Like rejecting the "Part of You"
[3:34:50] <%MegadBlitz> @neroinfinite but how does it go whoosh? is it the funny sounds that make it go or does the whoosh make it do funny sound
[3:34:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> bumper go ding
[3:35:17] <%baka_sugoi> EZ
[3:35:19] <TwistParabola> GAMER
[3:35:23] <%skizzuto> schmoovin
[3:35:26] <dukenux> yea bumber boys are fun
[3:35:37] <%IronOhki> @skizzuto schmoovin and groovin
[3:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> @neroinfinite Yeah but it's fun to overanalyze things and talk about it pedantically!
[3:36:11] <JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[3:36:16] <dukenux> im so proud that i beat the feather part on a shitty old controller with almost broken analogs
[3:36:16] <+pectusumbra> the music remains fantastic though
[3:36:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat are you a joystick or d-pad guy for platformers?
[3:36:38] <+izanagi22> I'm so glad the bumpers actually reset your boost, they'd be terrible otherwise
[3:36:38] <%Monkeyweed21> this just nail bounces again
[3:36:51] <+pectusumbra> gotta hit it from the side
[3:36:56] <%JoshManVGH> Clearly this person was betrayed... by a pinball machine.
[3:37:13] <%NitronStreams> Become the Pinball Master
[3:37:17] <AtisutoCurry> CELESTE LETS GOOO
[3:37:34] <%skizzuto> Pat you can dash while flying with the feather, you don't have to wait for it to run out
[3:37:55] <dukenux> that depressed girl sure plays a mean pinball
[3:38:15] <%TheWinged7> birb
[3:38:23] <%LeiaSkynoober> That and you don't need to wait before getting the next feather
[3:38:32] <%JoshManVGH> The pinball wizard's got SUCH a supple wrist!
[3:38:46] <%Ne1son> Ah yes the mountain is life
[3:38:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> the supplest
[3:39:06] <%NitronStreams> Getting over it with Bennet Foddey
[3:39:12] <Netgearer22> I love that the old lady's character is just "lol, I bet you can't do it." to which you are like "Screw you, I'm gonna make it just to spite you."
[3:39:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wanna see the correlation between wrist suppleness and pinball ability
[3:39:23] <dreadedcthulhu> you're special bc u can air dash
[3:39:24] <%cvp5127> Yea spite
[3:39:29] <%Agami23> spite is the best motivator
[3:39:33] <dukenux> Spite can be a rocket fuel
[3:39:34] <%Sotetsu> Hooray for being miserable
[3:39:36] <@Ranryu692> empires have been built out of spite
[3:39:39] <%Alazull> Spite is almost like a flying, angry block
[3:39:46] <%TheBensonator_> TOO SPITEFUL TO DIE
[3:39:50] <Brandon__Brando> the best level in the game
[3:39:51] <$velgaduere> thanks, omnipresent old woman
[3:39:52] <+Tredecian> hype
[3:39:56] <Jaller101514> spite can be 5he most powerful motivator
[3:40:01] <JetpackMcQuack> hit that snare
[3:40:02] <TwistParabola> best part
[3:40:05] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[3:40:11] <%MegadBlitz> what's with the snares?
[3:40:16] <BumblyMako> the "so angry at themself" really hit me. Like, I never realized how angry I seem to get at myself
[3:40:17] <%JoshManVGH> Spite climb is the best climb
[3:40:23] <%SinnerEbru> in my humble onion therere few better things to say 'fuck you' at and improve yourself to than spite
[3:40:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> go punch that anxiety brain right in the face
[3:40:33] <TwistParabola> that parts for speedrunners
[3:40:42] <+Tredecian> other paths
[3:40:43] <+rafaelba93> thats a shortcut
[3:40:43] <%TheLemuroid> That's a shortcut
[3:40:47] <Saltmeisterr> SHORCUTS BABY
[3:40:51] <%TimetodiveLTX> g a m e r
[3:40:53] <Netgearer22> Someone one to tell him that was the shortcut?
[3:40:54] <Komayeda> Dang, Pat's real good at this game
[3:41:02] <%Sotetsu> fmgNM
[3:41:08] <Komayeda> Took me like, 3 days to get to this part
[3:41:10] <%RayReborne> omg. Pats super right lol
[3:41:11] <$velgaduere> I don't wanna think about that dam level
[3:41:16] <%JoshManVGH> maybe that's the solution to self depreciating thoughts "fuck you me, I'm gonna this to SPITE me!"
[3:41:38] <Netgearer22> Honestly, that is why I try to make it in life
[3:41:46] <Netgearer22> I want to spite my shit bag dad for not being there in my life
[3:41:50] <%Sotetsu> How can you not see the gold crystals of death?
[3:42:04] <%SinnerEbru> @joshmanvgh thats what im telling myself to get past my imposter syndrome
[3:42:09] <$velgaduere> man that think warbargled for a long time without a breath

[3:43:35] <Netgearer22> This section in a nutshell "YOU ARE TALKING A LOT OFSHIT FOR SOMEONE IN HUGGING RANGE!!!"
[3:43:36] <Sulliman34> "your orbs are nothing!" "fine then megalaser"
[3:43:36] <Brandon__Brando> thats what the song reminds me of
[3:43:40] <Komayeda> She flies now? She flies now
[3:43:41] <+pectusumbra> This song is "Confronting Myself" for those that want it
[3:43:53] <+pectusumbra> Gametal did an amazing cover for this called "Self Reflection"
[3:43:55] <%Dova573> IMA FUCKING LOVE YA YOU BIIITCH
[3:44:02] <AurusD> I was kind of hoping the whole fight was one checkpoint lmao
[3:44:10] <TwistParabola> oof
[3:44:11] <Wolfstriker121> IM GONNA HUG YOU TO DEATH
[3:44:12] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:44:14] <%JoshManVGH> "Accept my self love, dark impulses!"
[3:44:15] <%skizzuto> So close!
[3:44:16] <%Alazull> BAITED
[3:44:20] <Brandon__Brando> @AurusD im sure it is on c-sides
[3:44:22] <%NitronStreams> Selfcest is the only way
[3:44:22] <$ImExtremelyManly> played
[3:44:32] <%madmanrambler> 'I'm gonna give you a hug YOU MASSIVE BITCH'
[3:44:41] <TwistParabola> lmao right
[3:44:45] <%JoshManVGH> @netgearer22 LUL
[3:44:48] <%MegadBlitz> wait WHAT
[3:44:49] <%Sotetsu> Too late
[3:44:50] <%Agami23> no, i dont
[3:44:56] <TwistParabola> tv people are wild
[3:44:57] <%twistedj3ster> no...
[3:44:58] <%cvp5127> selfcest is a tag tho
[3:44:59] <BumblyMako> What happened.
[3:45:01] <%Sotetsu> I don't remember that.
[3:45:08] <$ImExtremelyManly> that was a thing
[3:45:08] <NeroInfinite> Remember what?
[3:45:09] <$velgaduere> I'm just gonna forget whatever you just said
[3:45:10] <%Agami23> selfcest is already popular
[3:45:16] <%silvery_cricket> It was more than Disney was cool with anyone getting together aslong as it wasnt gay
[3:45:18] <%SovPho> it makes sense that loki would be attracted to loki
[3:45:19] <%MegadBlitz> what about selfcest??
[3:45:19] <%chance_h> Press F to F yourself
[3:45:19] <%SinnerEbru> wait were marvel fans homophobic?
[3:45:19] <%Agami23> i blame fate
[3:45:21] <dukenux> was that a twitter thing?
[3:45:22] <%Dova573> Cant have people loving themselves apparently
[3:45:22] <%Ne1son> No because it was Twitter people and they are not real @PatStaresAt
[3:45:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> so is normal sex outcest
[3:45:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> how does that work
[3:45:33] <%MegadBlitz> oh oh noo
[3:45:39] <%silvery_cricket> Loki can kiss another Loki just aslong as its not gay
[3:46:02] <+GemeSvev> I never thought selfcest would be controversial considering the number of times I've been told to go fuck myself.
[3:46:12] <NeroInfinite> twitter people don't exist just liek demons and ghosts
[3:46:29] <%MegadBlitz> ghosts are real
[3:46:34] <%silvery_cricket> Because Disney will go through all the sexual avenues they can before they ever even hint at two people of the same sex kissing
[3:46:40] <%afronooch> demons too
[3:46:42] <AurusD> oh this is like a whole world
[3:46:43] <dukenux> twitter people are to normal people what Badeline is to Madeline
[3:46:50] <%madmanrambler> If anybody is gonna get freaky in the MCU it should be loki though
[3:46:52] <%Sotetsu> She gotcha!
[3:46:54] <%Monkeyweed21> GET BACK HERE COWARD
[3:47:10] <%MegadBlitz> so anyway this is a cool sequence
[3:47:14] <%SinnerEbru> @dukenux this is stupid true
[3:47:14] <dukenux> except you can't hug them to death
[3:47:27] <%silvery_cricket> "OH Loki is Bi thats cool, can he even hold hands with another man"  Disney "HA FUCK NO"
[3:47:28] <%madmanrambler> is this the  best platforming boss fight?
[3:47:29] <Brandon__Brando> @dukenux true started going on twitter again holy shit I forgot
[3:47:30] <dukenux> so you're stuck with them annoying you
[3:47:46] <NeroInfinite> I mean you can totally hug a twitter person to death
[3:47:57] <Komayeda> Well, it's all in Da Narrative
[3:48:00] <%MegadBlitz> nice one pat
[3:48:03] <+pectusumbra> to be fair it's an involved sequence
[3:48:06] <Brandon__Brando> you would love the b-sides pat
[3:48:09] <%Agami23> it easy but because of how its going its more like a boss level
[3:48:09] <%silvery_cricket> Wow this just keeps going huh
[3:48:10] <+izanagi22> Meh, easy isn't necessarily bad
[3:48:10] <%IronOhki> You're progressing.
[3:48:10] <hearingthenseeing> go pat go
[3:48:12] <marvel877> Easy if you're using an analog stick for the feather movements...
[3:48:13] <+Thekirby8u> this is what b sides are for
[3:48:15] <+panlakes> should I play through this game before it leaves games pass?
[3:48:15] <%thebeargoesHONK> force you to start from the very start after each death...
[3:48:16] <+pectusumbra> and I BET there's a fucking strawberry in this
[3:48:17] <%JoshManVGH> @neroinfinite Is that what a block is? A death hug?
[3:48:17] <Saltmeisterr> I mean you died
[3:48:19] <$velgaduere> I think it's kind of meant to be a victory lap
[3:48:23] <Komayeda> I mean, I had trouble with it
[3:48:27] <NeroInfinite> yes
[3:48:27] <$velgaduere> yes that's correct
[3:48:28] <Saltmeisterr> so its not that easy
[3:48:36] <+Thekirby8u> godd that last chapter
[3:48:37] <jam1412585> Play the b sides pussy
[3:48:39] <marvel877> The optional stuff's hard.
[3:48:40] <TwistParabola> they're hard but there's even further, harder stuff
[3:48:43] <%afronooch> it was hard for me, but platformers arent my thing
[3:48:43] <dukenux> @marvel877 i had to ditch dpad for the feathers
[3:48:44] <%SharkMissile> Yeah main campaign is tough but fair
[3:48:48] <Komayeda> Maybe you're just *super* good at this game, ya ever think o' that Pat?
[3:48:48] <%madmanrambler> 100% is real hard, but the base game is real accomadating
[3:48:49] <%silvery_cricket> Are we even close to finishing this fight? This is going super long.
[3:48:49] <dukenux> couldn't do it otherwise
[3:48:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> that and if you're compulsed to go fast
[3:48:50] <Brandon__Brando> it was hard for me FeelsBadMan
[3:48:52] <%Mr_Pylon> B sides, some of the berries, bonus levels yeah
[3:48:53] <Therusher> B/C sides are real challenge but you've been doing better than most people
[3:48:54] <%SharkMissile> Like the terrible chapter 8
[3:48:58] <+Tredecian> the next chap starts to get difficult
[3:49:01] <+rafaelba93> extra stuff is amanzly stupid hard
[3:49:02] <HibikiYamada> everything that you have to do is pretty easy. all optional stuff usually provides challenge
[3:49:02] <AoiRob> the main story is only the first 1/3 of the game
[3:49:05] <Saltmeisterr> i say the base game is hard by average player satndards
[3:49:05] <%silvery_cricket> It just keeps going
[3:49:07] <%skizzuto> Chapters 8 and 9, and the B and C sides are all quite tough
[3:49:12] <BumblyMako> For the most part yeah. Chapter 8 is medium to hard while Chapter 9, the free DLC, is straight up hard
[3:49:13] <+pectusumbra> I mean you have died like hundreds of times
[3:49:14] <+Slim_Filthy> Base game stuff is tricky but not hard, other stuff is ball-mincing
[3:49:15] <TwistParabola> instant karma
[3:49:16] <%karovus> the normal levels took me a really long time but im also not good at platformers
[3:49:17] <%vVAstrAVv> wait and call it easy when you see your death counter pat lol
[3:49:31] <marvel877> Also the epilogue DLC chapter's tough because it requires you to use a technique speedrunners are used to doing.
[3:49:34] <Mattais88> "beating her ass" dies instantly
[3:49:39] <$velgaduere> oh no what if the boss fight got
[3:49:41] <$velgaduere> harder
[3:49:49] <Jaller101514> i mean youve been dying lots. what would you consider hard?
[3:49:50] <Brandon__Brando> the main story took me 8 hours your flying through this
[3:49:50] <+izanagi22> The checkpointing does really help lower the feel of the difficulty
[3:49:58] <%silvery_cricket> god it just keeps going
[3:50:00] <AurusD> this is so long lmao
[3:50:10] <Sp3ctre48> tfw this already looks really difficult to me WutFace
[3:50:13] <Sulliman34> GET SMASHED
[3:50:22] <%twistedj3ster> pat go squish
[3:50:23] <$velgaduere> the REMIX
[3:50:24] <Notorious_Mic> what's the mind goblins he's fighting in this game?
[3:50:29] <+Slim_Filthy> E-e-e-e AHH
[3:50:31] <%silvery_cricket> This is getting a bit gratuitous
[3:50:50] <Parapattern> This is getting a bit long in the tooth
[3:50:52] <%JoshManVGH> @notorious_mic Superfluous item collection
[3:50:55] <dukenux> I tried to come back and play the Heart level and... it's brutal
[3:50:58] <%madmanrambler> @Notorious_Mic he quit the game on the first level getting every strawberry
[3:50:58] <+Tredecian> @Notorious_Mic not getting all the collectibles
[3:51:01] <AurusD> this is really REALLY long
[3:51:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> this is definitely a boss paced for someone who knows what to do already
[3:51:08] <%skizzuto> @Notorious_Mic That he has to get all the optional collectibles or else he can't progress
[3:51:09] <dukenux> heeee-yah
[3:51:09] <BigFingerRo> YOU CAN DO IT PATRON
[3:51:10] <+Thekirby8u> Eh its supposed to be a whole level
[3:51:11] <%TimetodiveLTX> like this is probably awesome when you're not dying all the time
[3:51:13] <$velgaduere> @silvery_cricket you mean this thing you do the entire game is gratuitous? 🤔
[3:51:16] <spacecatstreams> got here just in time for heya
[3:51:19] <Notorious_Mic> gotcha thanks guys
[3:51:36] <@ssjklyco> Would the mind Goblin Pat be Bat?
[3:51:37] <%silvery_cricket> @velgaduere This boss fight has gone on so long the song has looped like 9 12 times
[3:51:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> get hugged on punk
[3:51:40] <%baronblank> I feel like the boss has a lost a little of the magic cause it's just so damn long lol
[3:51:44] <Komayeda> oof, this is the hard part
[3:51:46] <+pectusumbra> yeah this fight is probably easier when you do the game in a single sitting
[3:51:53] <+izanagi22> I liked this room
[3:51:54] <$velgaduere> @silvery_cricket that's most levels in this game
[3:52:00] <$velgaduere> actually, all of them
[3:52:16] <BigFingerRo> Now, imagine doing this with a keyboard
[3:52:17] <SinisterBroccoli> This is a really fun game to watch speedruns of too
[3:52:24] <%TimetodiveLTX> unironic dante woohoo
[3:52:26] <%madmanrambler> I love that near the end here tagging her is actually enabling you to move forward
[3:52:29] <BigFingerRo> boy did I struggle in this room
[3:52:41] <%JoshManVGH> Man if Path of Pain was like this, I would have played it so hard!
[3:52:43] <+GemeSvev> Is it weird I want a mario mod using Pat's "Haha" and "Wahoo"s?
[3:52:55] <%Backfire_Shot> Backfire_Shot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Howdy Pat Im trying to 100% Yakuza 7 please bless my slots rng im trying to get the stupid cds right now
[3:52:56] <$velgaduere> at least the boss fight had the decency of mixing things up with a remix
[3:52:59] <+pectusumbra> It's SYMBOLIC
[3:52:59] <sydowoodo> damn, how long is this fight??
[3:53:02] <%SovPho> yes that's weird
[3:53:06] <jam1412585> Wow so easy
[3:53:14] <%baka_sugoi> S K I L L
[3:53:14] <SinisterBroccoli> Nicer
[3:53:14] <%silvery_cricket> MORE
[3:53:26] <marvel877> I played this game with a Pokken controller. BOY, trying to do this whole sequence is hard without an analog stick.
[3:53:27] <%RayReborne> last stretch!!!
[3:53:28] <Netgearer22> What fight?
[3:53:38] <Komayeda> Ya know, now that I'm thinking about it, I think this game is more Forgiving rather than Easy. Like, there's not much consequence for dying, but like, you still die a *lot*
[3:53:38] <Netgearer22> Madeline is just gonna go give that evil side a hug
[3:53:45] <Netgearer22> Actually gonna hug the shit out of her
[3:53:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow you really ate that one
[3:53:49] <%SharkMissile> Something that occurs to me watching this is that this boss fight is REALLY log
[3:53:53] <spacecatstreams> YEE
[3:53:54] <%silvery_cricket> MORE
[3:53:56] <TwistParabola> yayyyyyy
[3:53:59] <$velgaduere> heya over FeelsBadMan
[3:53:59] <%GabeSweetMan> I was doing errands so I only just got here, did Pat get this far from CHAPTER 1?! Cuz, damn he's fast when he defeats the goblins.
[3:54:03] <%silvery_cricket> Oh thank god
[3:54:06] <%JoshManVGH> Oh shit, cryatal burst
[3:54:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> @Komayeda exactly
[3:54:11] <medril07> any boss that you use as a platform is great
[3:54:20] <%chance_h> Hug time
[3:54:22] <%TheLemuroid> @GabeSweetMan Not collecting berries makes a big difference
[3:54:23] <%madmanrambler> game is actually pretty short if you just do the main story
[3:54:28] <%cvp5127> per-so-na

[3:56:10] <%SinnerEbru> oh snap, i always clocked her as an old woman

[3:57:02] <%GabeSweetMan> The second half of Chapter 9 was the only thing I haven't beaten in Celeste. I just can't hit that skill ceiling. I was destroying my wrists trying to beat it and had to give it up.

[3:59:14] <+Tredecian> @GabeSweetMan dunno but it might make it easier on your wrists
[3:59:14] <%IronOhki> HEALING
[3:59:17] <Netgearer22> coward alert!!!
[3:59:22] <%StoopKid241> YEAH
[3:59:26] <BigFingerRo> He is.... a GAMER!
[3:59:28] <%JoshManVGH> Goblin Dying!
[3:59:31] <%stubborndeer> This game is clearly not yakuza 3
[3:59:37] <Goldenwolf98> he beat the goblins he said fuck the strawberries doodmaxhype
[3:59:44] <+paladinstarbuster> fight that goblin
[3:59:56] <%IronOhki> Okay is it dumb that Pat ignoring a  strawberry is hitting me the same as the uplifting video game progress?
[4:00:02] <dukenux> now now, be nice to your stand/goblin/dark reflection
[4:00:02] <+bluedude153> Ro ro fight the goblin
[4:00:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> hell yeah

[4:00:14] <%GabeSweetMan> @GabeSweetMan I'll check them out but Chapter 9 is on an entirely different level so I dunno.
[4:00:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> big climbs
[4:00:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> getting weird an mechanical
[4:00:26] <%RayReborne> MECHANIC SWAN SONG LETS GO
[4:00:32] <%SinnerEbru> i think this level was where i stopped
[4:00:35] <+Tredecian> end of season recap episode
[4:00:35] <+clevernamewhere> I just tuned in. How's pat handling the gobbos?
[4:00:36] <%stubborndeer> Pat this is a game for children not HUGE BABIES
[4:00:38] <%IronOhki> Clutch.
[4:00:41] <%skizzuto> This level is quite long
[4:00:46] <HibikiYamada> it's pretty long
[4:00:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> @IronOhki Nah, we proud of the progress he's making against goblins
[4:00:49] <BigFingerRo> Say @PatStaresAt, speaking of distances, how much distance would you say you walk Gief?
[4:00:49] <+pectusumbra> This is the beginning of the game again isn't it?
[4:00:52] <TwistParabola> the different zones make it feel shorter
[4:00:58] <spacecatstreams> @clevernamewhere he just said fuck those strawberries
[4:01:01] <+Thekirby8u> eh if you skip the strawbs
[4:01:12] <%JoshManVGH> !uptime
[4:01:12] <@Moobot> @JoshManVGH I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m.
[4:01:14] <+RealCynder> Pat not going after any berries does make it all a ton easier, since those are the challenge portions.
[4:01:18] <%GabeSweetMan> This level IS long, but it was very much NOT nearly as long if you're ignoring strawberries.
[4:01:59] <TwistParabola> he's got the hang of it
[4:02:00] <%JoshManVGH> 4 hours played, and you legitimately said "fuck the goblins." This one seems in the bag unless you wanna keep chugging
[4:02:17] <%madmanrambler> I like these little launcher sections as the end of each section
[4:02:17] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:02:26] <%trackles_64> friends
[4:02:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Has Pat collected ANY strawberries whatsoever?
[4:02:29] <%madmanrambler> its a fun little finale to each section
[4:02:39] <BigFingerRo> A FEW
[4:02:39] <%madmanrambler> 11
[4:02:41] <BigFingerRo> a few
[4:02:49] <%stubborndeer> Pat if you jump through space in this game it makes you gay
[4:02:50] <%Sotetsu> ...did you think it would count down?
[4:02:50] <%skizzuto> Remix all the previous levels' mechanics
[4:02:50] <medril07> adds a bit more every section of the music
[4:02:50] <+MisterAvry> music real good
[4:02:52] <%SinnerEbru> @gabesweetman yeah a few, but hes not busting his balls to get them
[4:02:57] <$velgaduere> bwfJam
[4:03:02] <dukenux> vargDuane
[4:03:38] <+rafaelba93> you can pass throug spikes from vehimd them
[4:03:41] <Saltmeisterr> getPop
[4:03:48] <%madmanrambler> that litttle area had a ton of freestyling to it, really fun
[4:03:49] <dukenux> vargFloss
[4:03:53] <%Sotetsu> fmgJAM
[4:04:04] <%GabeSweetMan> @rafaelba93 Yes, spikes are one-way damage.
[4:04:45] <%TheLemuroid> There's some goofy speedrun tech based on spikes being one way to ignore spike damage
[4:04:59] <TwistParabola> ????
[4:05:00] <+bluedude153> lmao
[4:05:14] <%madmanrambler> well that was a sick way to do that room!
[4:05:19] <%Sotetsu> psaUp
[4:05:20] <%Agami23> its kinda funny that this game was about a girl fighting her mind goblins
[4:05:23] <dukenux> i hated this part
[4:05:37] <TwistParabola> gamerrrr
[4:05:46] <$velgaduere> lobosJAM
[4:05:46] <Edible_Enthusiasm> cute :P
[4:05:54] <+izanagi22> Again the worst part of the climb
[4:05:55] <+Tredecian> faster
[4:05:55] <dukenux> Look at you, mrs. GAMER
[4:05:56] <DusK_The_Stray> Lmao
[4:05:57] <medril07> adds a beat
[4:06:07] <%GabeSweetMan> These have always been the hardest sections for me.
[4:06:08] <%trackles_64> is this game hard?
[4:06:11] <%skizzuto> that was close lol
[4:06:26] <+izanagi22> @trackles_64 It can be, especially if you do the extra levels
[4:06:31] <BigFingerRo> @trackles_64 I'd say so, but it's very enjoyable
[4:06:36] <+Thekirby8u> well designed hard I guess
[4:06:36] <dreadedcthulhu> @trackles_64 it's tricky but more or less forgiving
[4:06:37] <%madmanrambler> kinda variable difficulty @trackles_64 , main game isn't too much imo but you get to add a bunch of challenging extras
[4:06:38] <%skizzuto> I'd say so, yes.  Especially the optional levels
[4:06:41] <+Tredecian> @trackles_64 it get progressivly harder the farther you go
[4:06:42] <medril07> this is a great part. it's a culmination of all the work you've put into your journey.
[4:06:43] <dreadedcthulhu> dying doesn't set you back too far
[4:06:46] <%HotSauceFiend> @trackles_64 not very. it does require some skill with timing dashes , but thats an acquired skill
[4:06:52] <dreadedcthulhu> and respawning is fast
[4:06:58] <TwistParabola> gamerrr
[4:06:58] <dukenux> hard as balls, but in a satisfactory way
[4:07:06] <%Sotetsu> It's important to remember that Pat is a professional video gamer. fmgNERD
[4:07:12] <+izanagi22> Holy shit first try- that was hell on Joy cons
[4:07:16] <+pectusumbra> well you're supposed to feel STRONG at this point right? It's almost a victory lap
[4:07:18] <ppangboi> yeah this level always felt like a victory lap to me
[4:07:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> they nerf double jumps in the dlc
[4:07:23] <%GabeSweetMan> The genuine kaizo-shit is all optional.
[4:07:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> *double dashes
[4:07:30] <+MoeScams> anyone else feel like its to much game / not enough pat on the audio?
[4:07:32] <+pectusumbra> switfch you need
[4:07:47] <%HotSauceFiend> Pluis you CAN make it harder on  yourself by geting strawberries or the other collectibles. If thats not your speed then thats fine
[4:07:50] <BigFingerRo> @Sotetsu I remember in his introduction of CSB, he said he was a big video gamer, and that he didn't have a life cuz he chose to have many
[4:07:52] <TRZZXQ> some of the b-sides are wicked hard
[4:07:53] <%vVAstrAVv> did he just instinctively go for the strawberry?
[4:07:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> @MoeScams i also feel the same
[4:07:57] <dukenux> isn't this on switch?
[4:08:03] <$velgaduere> ding dong
[4:08:15] <%skizzuto> @dukenux Yes, it is!
[4:08:15] <+Tredecian> @dukenux yeah it is
[4:08:25] <ViewtifulBeck> viewti14Tataru

[4:09:12] <%HotSauceFiend> double goblin
[4:09:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> ok pat
[4:09:13] <+Thekirby8u> if he wants to do all content he do need it
[4:09:13] <Saltmeisterr> you don't need it
[4:09:16] <$ashenfrenzy> whoa a colored gem
[4:09:18] <%GabeSweetMan> NOW YOU CAN CHAOS CONTROL
[4:09:18] <+MisterAvry> it's some kind of gemerald
[4:09:19] <%chance_h> Chaos emerald
[4:09:20] <TwistParabola> CHAOS
[4:09:21] <$velgaduere> oh shit, Obama watch your back
[4:09:22] <Ris_Eltrut> bigger mind goblins
[4:09:22] <+Tredecian> yeah it kinda is a chaos emrald

[4:09:29] <BigFingerRo> @HotSauceFiend gotta FIIIIInd dos EEEEEEEEmeruls
[4:09:39] <+pectusumbra> the great emerald whose power allows me to feel~
[4:09:39] <+RealCynder> You need it if you want to beat the expansion ;p
[4:09:44] <marvel877> It functions like a Chaos Emerald, sure.
[4:09:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Careful, Obama might want it back.
[4:09:49] <%Ne1son> tHE EVEN MORE RARE tOMAR EMERALDS
[4:09:56] <%cvp5127> i dont suckle
[4:10:12] <+freakfullmetal2> its not the final area
[4:10:13] <+rafaelba93> final Kappa
[4:10:17] <%skizzuto> It's more of a victory lap
[4:10:17] <%GabeSweetMan> It's the victory lap.
[4:10:20] <$velgaduere> like I said, victory lap
[4:10:20] <%HotSauceFiend> Has Hyper Sonic or Sonic V3 showed up recent Sonic games? I remember being very excited seeing rainbow sonic
[4:10:22] <marvel877> CRAZY TALK
[4:10:24] <Komayeda> I mean, I thought it was hard
[4:10:26] <Therusher> Think that's the point, narrative-wise
[4:10:29] <+epoladia> It’s more of a thematic final gauntlet
[4:10:30] <Brandon__Brando> I think thats the point for the story
[4:10:43] <%chance_h> Hollow knight palace was hell
[4:10:49] <Edible_Enthusiasm> dark you is being a butt about positioning
[4:10:56] <+RealCynder> Yeah, stop making your chat look bad thinking this game is hard.
[4:10:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> @HotSauceFiend god no, Super Sonic is the only form Sonic Team will acknowledge these days
[4:11:04] <%GabeSweetMan> It's almost like defeating you mind goblins make you SUPER STRONG!
[4:11:05] <ppangboi> you don't love poggoing on saws?
[4:11:05] <BigFingerRo> I'm just here to hear Pat scream like he did in the Hitman streams
[4:11:07] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I thought this was more of a victory lap.
[4:11:09] <%waltzqueen> @chance_h hallow nest deserved what it got and white palace was why
[4:11:10] <dukenux> well yea, you're supposed to beat this part easily with the power of frienshio
[4:11:22] <dukenux> the real challenge comes later
[4:11:22] <+epoladia> @gabesweetman TRUE
[4:11:24] <TwistParabola> he's becoming italian
[4:11:30] <BigFingerRo> YES, ACCENT TIME
[4:11:34] <%Sotetsu> Mama mia!
[4:11:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Pizza pasta
[4:11:40] <$velgaduere> the spaghetti!! it's all over the floor-a!!
[4:11:57] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[4:12:09] <%stubborndeer> Isn't this tetris
[4:12:21] <Brandon__Brando> this is like a Mario game ok difficulty. but once its done it says ok you want to try the real shit
[4:12:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Nope.
[4:12:22] <Komayeda> No, this is the Wind level
[4:12:22] <+izanagi22> No?
[4:12:29] <Saltmeisterr> ano
[4:12:39] <%Keyd00d> Dang he's been blazing through huh
[4:12:43] <+Thekirby8u> aww I like the music change in this part
[4:12:45] <%GabeSweetMan> ??
[4:12:49] <tanarath> Yeah, he's kinda garbage, but if he stays like that he'll hurt others. And maybe he can be not shit?
[4:12:51] <%IronOhki> I HATE THIS SEQUENCE.
[4:12:54] <medril07> bloody wind
[4:13:03] <$velgaduere> Mr. Oshiro isn't a person, he's literally dead and represents all the bad parts of his former self, like a revenant does lmao
[4:13:06] <ppangboi> wind should be illegal
[4:13:10] <@ssjklyco> Gotta charge your JO crystals
[4:13:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Jake Off Chris-tals
[4:13:16] <marvel877> Pat, the JO crystals was after this one.
[4:13:18] <$velgaduere> so yeah, totally with Badeline
[4:13:19] <%GabeSweetMan> I like the wind sections actually. The make everything very clear what sequence you're supposed to do.
[4:13:19] <ViewtifulBeck> Charge your JO crystal.
[4:13:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> air is the enemy
[4:13:29] <@ssjklyco> JO JO Crystals
[4:13:41] <dukenux> Mr Oshiro needs a JO crystal to chill out
[4:13:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[4:13:46] <%IronOhki> All this time, we didn't know what Jo-jo stood for.
[4:13:52] <%GabeSweetMan> You. Did it.
[4:13:58] <Brandon__Brando> right in the mouth
[4:14:08] <medril07> that was bull
[4:14:09] <dukenux> @IronOhki "jack off, jack on"
[4:14:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember that you can jump off the snow balls!
[4:14:49] <%HotSauceFiend> on the right track
[4:14:57] <%skizzuto> gotta guide it past the walls
[4:14:57] <%GabeSweetMan> This one takes a bit.
[4:14:58] <+MisterAvry> this shit
[4:15:00] <TwistParabola> oh THIS part
[4:15:04] <Komayeda> oh This Part is Fucked
[4:15:17] <tanarath> It's so easy.
[4:15:19] <%GabeSweetMan> This mechanic is INSANE in the B and C sides.
[4:15:24] <LoneFonte> this one took me a while, yeah LUL
[4:15:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> gonna take you for a ride
[4:15:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Yes
[4:15:38] <Brandon__Brando> yes
[4:15:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Oops
[4:15:52] <TwistParabola> yeah
[4:15:54] <%GabeSweetMan> YUP

[4:16:28] <BigFingerRo> HOOO
[4:16:28] <TwistParabola> close
[4:16:29] <%Keyd00d> lmao
[4:16:29] <%dalmek> nice save
[4:16:29] <%skizzuto> nice save
[4:16:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Hooplah!
[4:16:31] <%NitronStreams> OH MY GOD
[4:16:31] <%GabeSweetMan> I appreciate that it is lenient by a few pixels.
[4:16:34] <%Sotetsu> fmgS
[4:16:37] <%Keyd00d> HOOPLAH
[4:16:57] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK THAT STRAWBERRY IN PARTICULAR
[4:17:03] <tanarath> HOOPLAH MEH!
[4:17:04] <%GabeSweetMan> 45 minutes!
[4:17:18] <%HotSauceFiend> i keep looking at the strawberrier and thinking "Kris get the Banana"
[4:17:27] <+MisterAvry> good
[4:17:33] <%Keyd00d> I see the strawberry goblin has been defeated
[4:17:38] <%skizzuto> @HotSauceFiend Potassium
[4:17:52] <%HotSauceFiend> Potassium
[4:18:01] <TwistParabola> 'potassium' always kills me
[4:18:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Not potassium
[4:18:09] <%watchmanfury> watchmanfury subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Fandaniel is boring I miss the other guys
[4:18:12] <+MisterAvry> the strawblin, they call him
[4:18:13] <BigFingerRo> Potassium
[4:18:18] <Saltmeisterr> man if pat hates strawb, wait till he hears about GOLDEN strawbs
[4:18:21] <$velgaduere> any potassiumers in chat?
[4:18:26] <sydowoodo> get the banana kris
[4:18:37] <%Sotetsu> Pattassium
[4:18:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> potassium is the most fun and safe element, specially when you put it in water
[4:18:48] <ppangboi> big screen
[4:18:55] <TwistParabola> Madeline get the orbs
[4:18:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Huh, Strawberries ARE rather high in potassium.
[4:19:07] <+LionheartedRebel> Kris, get the potassium!
[4:19:09] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Hope fandaniel gets replaced by someone with actual goals instead of 'kill everyone in every world'
[4:19:17] <dukenux> they are
[4:19:17] <%HotSauceFiend> wait no really?
[4:19:22] <BigFingerRo> @GabeSweetMan are they? I never knwe
[4:19:24] <%skizzuto> So are potatoes
[4:19:26] <+paladinstarbuster> is it
[4:19:27] <%Keyd00d> pat get the strawberry
[4:19:33] <NeroInfinite> they are,
[4:19:34] <TwistParabola> doge?
[4:19:36] <%Monkeyweed21> strawberries make you grow taller
[4:19:42] <tanarath> Get the Potassium, Pat.
[4:19:42] <dukenux> fruits are rather high in potassium and phosphorus
[4:19:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Thanks to Potassium, one of the units for measuring radioactivity is the BED or Banana Equivalent Dose.
[4:19:45] <$thomassolorio> potatoes have more potassium than bananas
[4:19:47] <@ssjklyco> The strawberry seeds are the actual fruits of the strawberry. It's also not a berry
[4:19:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Just looked it up. 18 g of potassium per serving. Not as much as bananas, but yeah.
[4:19:48] <oddbunker> you got this
[4:19:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> strawberries are also high in tastiness
[4:19:55] <Edible_Enthusiasm> the last obstacle
[4:19:56] <sydowoodo> get the strawberry, pat
[4:19:59] <%Keyd00d> yar
[4:20:00] <+mikesapartment> lots of downloading cars
[4:20:00] <BigFingerRo> COCK AND NORA
[4:20:06] <FirewallStorm> get the potato pat
[4:20:06] <%HotSauceFiend> lots of pirating, not enough POtassium
[4:20:10] <wqorst> strawberries taste good, unlike banans
[4:20:13] <@QueequegTheater> You mean stealing Kappa
[4:20:15] <tanarath> HOOPLAH MEH!
[4:20:17] <BigFingerRo> I WOULD download a car
[4:20:28] <%IronOhki> PROGRESSION
[4:20:32] <BigFingerRo> in fact, I downloaded a whole city for a project
[4:20:32] <%NitronStreams> 👏👏👏
[4:20:40] <%GabeSweetMan> @ssjklyco That's an uphill battle you're fighting.
[4:20:44] <$velgaduere> Pat is becoming one with the goblin
[4:20:45] <+TheCobaltiumLeopard> god damn this looks like a Mario maker level
[4:21:10] <TRZZXQ> If I could download a car, I'd have money to buy things I don't need like music
[4:21:11] <+MisterAvry> oh man this shit too
[4:21:27] <%GabeSweetMan> lol you actually grabbed that corner for a sec
[4:21:33] <JetpackMcQuack> now that's platforming
[4:21:47] <%HotSauceFiend> OH this is like the B-sde level i hate/love
[4:21:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Left side optional, right side mandatory.
[4:22:18] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I honestly never would have thought that this would become Pat's favorite game
[4:22:40] <Edible_Enthusiasm> smoosh
[4:22:41] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[4:22:42] <BigFingerRo> DUNKED
[4:22:43] <+Mechanized82> this game is really good. I ignored most of the strawberries once they got too hard lol
[4:22:47] <TwistParabola> classy trap
[4:22:56] <%GabeSweetMan> NO DASHING
[4:23:05] <+bluedude153> So we are going all the b and c sides right :v
[4:23:07] <ppangboi> Yeah this level in particular has some nasty strawberries
[4:23:25] <+izanagi22> Oh wow, I never noticed you can actually see Madeleine spinning in the bubble
[4:23:25] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[4:23:37] <%IronOhki> Got em
[4:23:37] <TwistParabola> first try
[4:23:40] <+Thekirby8u> yoo accidental super jump
[4:23:48] <TwistParabola> you CAN go through the gap
[4:23:52] <%GabeSweetMan> @izanagi22 Omg you're super right.... I was always so focused on the platforming.
[4:23:59] <spacecatstreams> no door skip? pffft
[4:24:01] <spacecatstreams> jk
[4:24:13] <%Agami23> its because we cant see the pyon
[4:24:16] <dukenux> most of my superjumps were accidental
[4:24:19] <%skizzuto> Fun fact you can skip the switches in this room if you're a true gamer
[4:24:40] <%TheLemuroid> The game feels really different when you know the advanced tech
[4:24:46] <+Tredecian> you can dash downwards
[4:24:51] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> is that what they call a pro gamer maneuver?
[4:24:55] <+blademaster247> Is this B-Side? I don't remember this at all
[4:25:07] <BigFingerRo> Sounds like someone's tickling your butthole there, Pat
[4:25:12] <%HotSauceFiend> just don't bother trying to get to the locked levels, those are hard
[4:25:14] <%skizzuto> Nah, this is Chapter 7, A side
[4:25:16] <LoneFonte> nope, normal chap 7
[4:25:17] <mattymcfilth> TECH
[4:25:24] <+Mechanized82> @blademaster247 nope critical path
[4:25:27] <%chance_h> @spacecatstreams yeah and he hasn’t backwards long jumped into gay baby jail yet. Is Pat even a Gamer?
[4:25:34] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> we're certain this is chapter 7 though?
[4:25:54] <+blademaster247> Huh, guess I just forgot about this
[4:25:59] <%SharkMissile> You might find this hard to believe but the C side of this is a fucking nightmare
[4:26:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're getting close to the amount of time you spent on the first level
[4:26:15] <+Thekirby8u> wouldnt have a double dash otherwise
[4:26:17] <TRZZXQ> C-Sides are at least short
[4:26:18] <%HotSauceFiend> this B-Side was a PAIN
[4:26:21] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> so long as we're certain...
[4:26:21] <marvel877> if it were 100%, all the strawberries would be collected...
[4:26:27] <ppangboi> its funny considering how long it is but I do think this is the most forgettable level
[4:26:31] <+Mechanized82> patience~
[4:26:31] <%IronOhki> Fuck I remember this sequence so clearly I can feel it right now
[4:26:31] <AurusD> Celeste is pretty long
[4:26:46] <%XzileGaming> ARRR
[4:26:51] <%NitronStreams> YARRRR
[4:26:52] <%IronOhki> @AurusD Yes, but Pat is a professional.
[4:26:55] <LoneFonte> Pirate Pat is back
[4:26:56] <+DonnyJaBronie> nice pirate voice
[4:26:59] <NeroInfinite> Pat the pirate
[4:27:03] <%Sotetsu> Arr , matey!
[4:27:20] <TwistParabola> oof
[4:27:21] <%RayReborne> PERFECT
[4:27:21] <BigFingerRo> NUUU
[4:27:21] <%TimetodiveLTX> F
[4:27:22] <dukenux> a checkpoint there would be really appreciated
[4:27:24] <%NitronStreams> Awww come on
[4:27:24] <NeroInfinite> why did you do that? LUL
[4:27:26] <+Mechanized82> @ppangboi I think the game just really starts cooking toward the end and it's over before you realize it
[4:27:34] <+DonnyJaBronie> damn
[4:27:36] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> let's get Pat a parrot for his birthday, chat
[4:27:39] <%HotSauceFiend> there was a hole on the side next to the R-orb
[4:27:40] <%GabeSweetMan> What is interesting about the B and C sides is the actual level length is MINISCULE compared to the A sides, they're just so ridiculous that it takes you ~3 times as long to beat them as the A sides.
[4:27:43] <%Sotetsu> Imagine if every room was this long
[4:27:45] <%SovPho> that was a pretty good whinny the pooh
[4:28:01] <+DonnyJaBronie> NICE
[4:28:06] <BigFingerRo> DASRITE
[4:28:09] <%XzileGaming> yeah its a good cosplay
[4:28:11] <%Sotetsu> fmgSHAKE
[4:28:22] <ppangboi> @Mechanized82 I agree. And I think since this level has every other one contained within it the individual mechanics of the level stand out less in my mind. Still, it's not a bad level.
[4:28:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Just Talk: The Ultimate Super Power
[4:28:39] <+Thekirby8u> dog time
[4:28:49] <%TheLemuroid> @Mechanized82 It's gets original past this point
[4:28:58] <%ClericOfSparda> lytCLAP
[4:29:03] <%Monkeyweed21> time for the real level
[4:29:04] <Therusher> Yeah I really like this part of it
[4:29:04] <+DonnyJaBronie> this music is so sick
[4:29:12] <+paladinstarbuster> if i die i die
[4:29:13] <%GabeSweetMan> 29~

[4:44:06] <%tebari> tebari subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! The real friends are the goblins we made along the way.
[4:44:07] <%Fooguwu> yeesh pat, just because you have man emotions
[4:44:07] <+bluedude153> I mean you only did 1/3 of it
[4:44:07] <%SharkMissile> psaDown psaDown psaDown
[4:44:09] <The_Legendairy> i mean you played like half of it
[4:44:09] <Aeon_Nephilim> Each Goblin Slain makes you more powerful
[4:44:09] <dukenux> Yea but it's tough as balls
[4:44:10] <ArguablyEpic> HOW DARE YOU
[4:44:12] <+Tredecian> but you only beat the tutorial
[4:44:12] <+epoladia> It’s still GOOD
[4:44:13] <%zzNamttamzz> The B sides are the real game
[4:44:14] <wibbwobbler> LUL LUL
[4:44:15] <peyodogo> hard hard disagree lmao
[4:44:15] <%skizzuto> Now watch a speedrun to have your mind blown
[4:44:15] <%Sotetsu> sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude
[4:44:16] <$velgaduere> @GabeSweetMan yeah but he beat it tho
[4:44:17] <tukds> SAME
[4:44:18] <+zoopbooploop> And Accessibility Options
[4:44:19] <willsin4fun> what was the goblino tho
[4:44:19] <%dalmek> fair enough
[4:44:20] <@ssjklyco> Less mind goblins in SMB
[4:44:21] <Sulliman34> i cannot disagree with you more lmao
[4:44:22] <HibikiYamada> pat being wrong is MY mind goblin
[4:44:22] <ammobasket> Nice job!
[4:44:22] <+rafaelba93> there is more tho
[4:44:23] <+DonnyJaBronie> hard disagree
[4:44:25] <%HotSauceFiend> But thats a true statement, Super Meat Boy is better
[4:44:26] <%ScrapKingKeita> It's a cute game that helped the dev realize they were trans, so that's something nice
[4:44:26] <$TheSmerdis> Gotta go for The End is Nigh now
[4:44:26] <ArguablyEpic> THAT GAME IS LITERALLY PART OF MY PHD THESIS
[4:44:27] <NeroInfinite> is ana lright game tbh
[4:44:28] <dukenux> I honestly preffer this to SMB
[4:44:30] <marvel877> ...oh, right, poor empathy skills.
[4:44:31] <%Bluwizard21> we could use another super meat boy
[4:44:32] <%Ne1son> Very overrated
[4:44:32] <%TimetodiveLTX> that makes sense, considering
[4:44:33] <crackedhappiness> did you already play the second one?
[4:44:34] <TheNewZealandStory> i wish i started skipping cutscenes, this game's story and characters are unbearable
[4:44:35] <%watchmanfury> Good job Pat
[4:44:37] <tukds> Better story too
[4:44:37] <LSether> I always though it was over rated.
[4:44:38] <%Agami23> eh. the story probably resonates with other people abit more
[4:44:39] <%Monkeyweed21> you didnt even look at any of the challenging levels tho
[4:44:39] <%Saadi90> Disagree. It’s great. But it’s cool. You do you
[4:44:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat just wants the raw jump meats
[4:44:41] <+bluedude153> There are like, 3 tiers of levels over the ones you did
[4:44:41] <%chance_h> Halo is a better platformer
[4:44:41] <tanarath> Pat's just activating crazy talk, it's fine.
[4:44:42] <+RealCynder> 'That game was so easy and good, I don't want the rest'  -avoids all the challenging parts-
[4:44:45] <%ClericOfSparda> What about VVVVV
[4:44:46] <+blademaster247> Why can't this great steak be A5 wagyu beef?
[4:44:47] <%cvp5127> lul
[4:44:47] <+DonnyJaBronie> oh definitely
[4:44:47] <+Mechanized82> aren't the b sides actually just super meat Boy?
[4:44:48] <%Sotetsu> @arguablyepic Super meet boy?
[4:44:49] <+zoopbooploop> I didn't get all the strawberries, but I did beat all but the final level with the wavedash
[4:44:50] <hearingthenseeing> That's fine
[4:44:51] <sennoh> kinda agree
[4:44:53] <+DonnyJaBronie> it's really good, but also overrated
[4:44:55] <%madmanrambler> yeah its really just an 8.5/10
[4:44:59] <%madmanrambler> but I enjoy it
[4:45:00] <+MisterAvry> that's how I feel about Journey
[4:45:00] <+paladinstarbuster> Dont get mad at him for not liking it chat
[4:45:01] <+Tredecian> they werent talking about the base levels
[4:45:03] <%cooldude69xx> @RealCynder He didnt say that
[4:45:04] <%Monkeyweed21> no one talked about it like that
[4:45:06] <%Kaask> but my feefees
[4:45:06] <ArguablyEpic> @sotetsu nah Celeste
[4:45:07] <@ssjklyco> Just do it
[4:45:07] <%ScrapKingKeita> I feel it might be because of the LGBT community latching onto it
[4:45:08] <srv4254> yea
[4:45:09] <Sulliman34> ah so its more a fault of your own media stream
[4:45:10] <%Sotetsu> psaWrong
[4:45:11] <$velgaduere> "but Pat! your opinion invalidates MY opinion! I'm so angry!!!"
[4:45:13] <%Fooguwu> It was important for a lot of people. Sometimes these things find you at the right time
[4:45:14] <+blademaster247> It fun to play
[4:45:18] <dukenux> I could agree that the story is overrated, but not the gameplay
[4:45:19] <%GabeSweetMan> It's my favorite 8/10 tho.
[4:45:20] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[4:45:20] <%MacMog> I mean, if you believe it will cure all diseases forever, then yes overrated
[4:45:20] <%Sotetsu> psaSmug
[4:45:23] <%RayReborne> it was the case of One Guy ™
[4:45:24] <+Thekirby8u> eh it wasnt so bad
[4:45:25] <%rkbinder> Its called being subtle
[4:45:25] <+LionheartedRebel> My experience with TLOU.
[4:45:26] <+DonnyJaBronie> I like the dialogue but that's super subjective
[4:45:27] <marvel877> Who the hell talked it up like that to you?
[4:45:28] <cpt_langosta> Big Spider
[4:45:28] <tanarath> I mean, you went through a similar journey that she did, you accepted your gobolin.
[4:45:30] <tukds> yes
[4:45:31] <WebmanJax> So, I don't know if you really did defeat the goblin. I think you should have at least tried for evert strawberry you saw. But not gone out and hunted down every one. This way it just feels like you arbitrarily decided to not get certain ones that you could have easilly.
[4:45:31] <Sulliman34> i think theres a speedrunner mode
[4:45:31] <%TheLemuroid> Speedrun mode
[4:45:32] <$velgaduere> yes that's called speedrunning
[4:45:32] <Saltmeisterr> u can justskip i
[4:45:33] <$realm_forge> Pat leaves the party with a wet fart
[4:45:34] <%skizzuto> You can skip cutscenes yeah
[4:45:34] <+Ardailec> yeah a speedrun mode
[4:45:36] <hearingthenseeing> I think you can skip
[4:45:36] <dukenux> yea just mash it
[4:45:36] <%dalmek> there might be a speedrun mode or something?
[4:45:36] <Therusher> If you keep playing the B/C sides are all gameplay only IIRC
[4:45:41] <+bluedude153> The B sides and C sides are really goof though
[4:45:41] <%IronOhki> Woolie definitely flipped his shit.
[4:45:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm assuming there's less dialogue in the extra content
[4:45:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember: people are stupid and bad at understanding things they havent experienced
[4:45:46] <@QueequegTheater> EVERYONE
[4:45:46] <+MisterAvry> people were pretty crazy about it
[4:45:46] <marvel877> No.
[4:45:47] <+mikesapartment> the platforming is really good and you skipped most of it
[4:45:48] <%Bluwizard21> a lot like many other games
[4:45:48] <Goldenwolf98> people went insane for it
[4:45:49] <+zoopbooploop> There's a speedrun mode that disables the cutscenes
[4:45:49] <%TheLemuroid> He's saying it was overhyped which can be a problem
[4:45:50] <+Xelig> I never heard of this game until I tuned into the stream
[4:45:50] <@Ranryu692> yeah, it seemed a bit much
[4:45:50] <TheNewZealandStory> lol im glad im not the only one who couldnt stand the cutscenes in this
[4:45:51] <%Ne1son> People wouldnt shut up about it
[4:45:52] <%SovPho> that seemed kinda boring
[4:45:52] <hearingthenseeing> dat soundtrack dope though
[4:45:52] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Not really
[4:45:52] <cpt_langosta> yeah, it's no Microsoft Bob, I tell you what.
[4:45:52] <Vyneci> I love how people are already twisting it into "Oh, he fucking hates it!" LUL
[4:45:53] <%Maids4lyfe> I never heard of this game until today
[4:45:57] <dyllustrate> When did it ever say that Madeline was trans?
[4:46:01] <JetpackMcQuack> people saying goty
[4:46:01] <+DonnyJaBronie> i'm wearing a Celeste hoodie right now lol
[4:46:01] <zephyrgun> do we remember when it came out: no
[4:46:02] <@ssjklyco> You know what's crazy? I learned they are making That 90s Show
[4:46:04] <Goldenwolf98> it was close to an Undertale situation
[4:46:05] <BattlexQueen> There were so many articles
[4:46:06] <Sulliman34> PFFFFFF thats a fucking statement
[4:46:07] <%HotSauceFiend> Did this get more hype than Shovel knight>
[4:46:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt are you sure that you didn't play up the praise in your mind as part of your goblins
[4:46:14] <%SovPho> It's just super meat boy++
[4:46:17] <+kknutson4> It was an early Switch game, so it was over-hyped due to the drought
[4:46:19] <@Ranryu692> @ssjklyco I'm hopeful only because Red and Kitty will be back
[4:46:19] <hearingthenseeing> Back to hollow knight lol
[4:46:20] <ammobasket> EVERYONE was talking about it
[4:46:21] <%RayReborne> i just heard it was great, played it years after release, really enjoyed it
[4:46:22] <%GabeSweetMan> There's a point at which you've played this game for so many hours that the amount of dialogue is MINISCULE in comparison to having put 90 hours into it.
[4:46:22] <Brandon__Brando> oh hell no its not undertale but I still love it
[4:46:23] <%IronOhki> I guess it validated some things for some people.
[4:46:23] <+MisterAvry> @Vyneci all or nothing!
[4:46:23] <+paladinstarbuster> i dont remember that
[4:46:24] <+Kyma1020> I never heard that Celeste was the future of platformers
[4:46:24] <%madmanrambler> @dyllustrate gotta get to the secret ending, its implied but not outright stated
[4:46:25] <%cooldude69xx> @WebmanJax The goblin wasnt that he couldnt get the fruit, it was refusing to progress without the fruit
[4:46:32] <dukenux> yea no, it's the past of platforming with lotsa fun additions
[4:46:32] <@QueequegTheater> i think Undertale is a bit overrated.  It's still really good.
[4:46:32] <+mczarklesby> I think it's like how a kid's book can be an excellent kid's book, but if you go in expecting War and Peace....
[4:46:37] <The_Legendairy> "man who only gets ending A of nier automata doesn't understand what the big deal is"
[4:46:37] <marvel877> I still haven't played Undertale because of how much people go on about it. I plan to, just I got 30 other RPGs in the pipeline.
[4:46:40] <%dalmek> oh coyote time?
[4:46:41] <%SharkMissile> Yeah you get a little grace
[4:46:41] <Sowlith> pat only played like half the game, so fair I guess
[4:46:41] <ammobasket> ALL the indie devs were SUPER ABOUT IT
[4:46:43] <%ScrapKingKeita> @dyllustrate The dev released some promo art where she has a trans flag and then talked about how after finishing the game, they realized it was an accidental "I'm trans" story
[4:46:43] <%skizzuto> Good old Coyote Time
[4:46:44] <%polothegreatest> i think it was the ending
[4:46:50] <ArguablyEpic> Okay except I think undertale’s super overrated so tastes are arbitrary
[4:46:55] <cpt_langosta> coyote/drake time
[4:46:55] <%cvp5127> whats that
[4:46:58] <%RayReborne> Coyote Time? wtf
[4:47:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow thats a good fuckin name
[4:47:04] <willsin4fun> I think this game seems extremely okay
[4:47:04] <Sulliman34> you probably wont come back to this game but you can wavedash!
[4:47:07] <peyodogo> @The_Legendairy lmao
[4:47:10] <+MisterAvry> Coyote Time is a super genius name
[4:47:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> like Wile E Coyote
[4:47:18] <%karovus> celeste's excellent mechanics are the real reason people love it, whether they know it or not
[4:47:19] <+DonnyJaBronie> that's SO GOOD
[4:47:24] <dukenux> See i think Undertale's overrated, and Deltarune is a much better game
[4:47:25] <hearingthenseeing> Oh cool
[4:47:27] <%GabeSweetMan> That's a perfect name.
[4:47:29] <cpt_langosta> it is NUTS in uncharted games. drake just flies like a full foot off the platform
[4:47:29] <%IronOhki> Human error jump controls.
[4:47:29] <%RayReborne> so not quite DKC ledge jumping?
[4:47:33] <%RayReborne> but close
[4:47:36] <ArguablyEpic> @karovus exactly
[4:47:36] <Sulliman34> the later levels really force you to learn the game in and out, its some kaizo shit sometimes
[4:47:43] <%MacMog> yes, since you skipped most of the gameplay, the dialogue seems like a lot
[4:47:46] <dukenux> like, the chapter 1 deltarune too
[4:47:46] <%notsoy> more games should do DKC ledge jumping
[4:47:47] <hearingthenseeing> at least we got a Canada game lol
[4:47:53] <+DonnyJaBronie> as you should
[4:47:54] <%HotSauceFiend> What's next on the Goblin List?
[4:47:56] <Brandon__Brando> if all you care about is the gameplay you would love the b and c sides
[4:47:58] <%NitronStreams> WOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:47:59] <%RayReborne> yep, good job Pat
[4:47:59] <%madmanrambler> yeah I wandered in about around then and you were doing good at handling that
[4:47:59] <%IronOhki> But that centipede though.
[4:48:01] <%dalmek> nicely done
[4:48:01] <$velgaduere> gobbo copium achieved
[4:48:02] <+Tredecian> good job clap
[4:48:03] <%baka_sugoi> SLAIN

[4:48:07] <Zebroneath> goblin defeated!
[4:48:09] <+Emperor_Z> Everyone hates your pie tho
[4:48:09] <+pectusumbra> and you ACTIVELY ignored ones that were dumped in your lap
[4:48:10] <ammobasket> Like the Roadrunner catroons
[4:48:11] <%NitronStreams> Congratulations
[4:48:13] <hearingthenseeing> Pat escapes the seventh ring of hell
[4:48:15] <Goldenwolf98> now play Banjo Kazooie and avoid all the collectables Kappa
[4:48:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck that fuckin centipede
[4:48:24] <cpt_langosta> strawberries are my enemy in real life
[4:48:26] <%chance_h> Congratulations
[4:48:28] <marvel877> Wasn't the centipede around level 4?
[4:48:29] <%GabeSweetMan> @Goldenwolf98 LUL
[4:48:31] <%Monkeyweed21> now for the other 2/3rds of Celeste

[4:49:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Wow.
[4:49:33] <cpt_langosta> for you, it's the darkest dungeon release date, but for me, it's tuesday
[4:49:35] <%GabeSweetMan> LMAO
[4:49:36] <+zoopbooploop> TIME FOR MIND GOBLINS X
[4:49:36] <%asgard147> limesS
[4:49:37] <%RayReborne> Wow
[4:49:37] <+pectusumbra> yeah you mentioned that
[4:49:37] <@goose_attack_almanac> I can believe it
[4:49:38] <$velgaduere> makes sense
[4:49:38] <Goldenwolf98> IT HAS SO MUCH MIND GOBLINS
[4:49:38] <dukenux> How fitting
[4:49:38] <%Kaask> good
[4:49:38] <%NitronStreams> Oh man
[4:49:39] <The_Murray_Carp> understandable
[4:49:40] <%SovPho> Yeah, that tracks
[4:49:40] <Sulliman34> if i lose a single person in darkest dungeon i have to stop playing
[4:49:40] <+Nobrev> ooooooh
[4:49:40] <Zebroneath> I can imagine!
[4:49:41] <%dalmek> ah, the mind hobgoblin
[4:49:42] <tukds> why???
[4:49:42] <Vyneci> YEAH I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CALL IT THAT LUL
[4:49:43] <%Bluwizard21> whens darkest 2?
[4:49:43] <Sulliman34> its nervewracking
[4:49:44] <%IronOhki> What's the specific goblin in Darkest's Dungeon?
[4:49:44] <%ScrapKingKeita> So how big is this goblins list?
[4:49:45] <%GabeSweetMan> OH MAN THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
[4:49:47] <+JonathLP> OHH SHIT, SECRET BOSS DD2!
[4:49:48] <$realm_forge> GIGA GOBLINS
[4:49:48] <Goldenwolf98> I can't even deal with it LUL
[4:49:48] <+paladinstarbuster> YEYYEYEEYEY
[4:49:48] <Edible_Enthusiasm> don't do it
[4:49:49] <TheQuadrupleS> THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE LUL
[4:49:49] <WebmanJax> @WebmanJax Well yeah, I get that. But like there were some just there, that he could have grabbed but then refused to. What I feel would have been more fighting it would have been at least trying for every one. Give it a few goes, and then giving up on them. If he tried for it, it would have triggered the goblin flair up and giving up on it would have been defeating it. At least that's what I think. I could be wrong.
[4:49:54] <Mirrorcatch> that's a long goblin
[4:49:54] <+MisterAvry> Darkest Goblins
[4:49:54] <%watchmanfury> it absolutely would be the final boss, I have no real OCD problem and I hate it so bad
[4:49:54] <zephyrgun> that game's goblins are undefeated
[4:49:55] <HibikiYamada> they mentioned making dd2 a bit more fair, apparently.
[4:49:56] <+DonnyJaBronie> TRUE
[4:49:57] <hearingthenseeing> What games are Paige's mind goblins in?
[4:50:01] <+JonathLP> SECRET BOSS Darkest Dungeon 2!
[4:50:02] <%NitronStreams> Goblinest Dungeon
[4:50:04] <$velgaduere> the final boss is in fact a mind goblin
[4:50:05] <Onamar> Darkest Dungeon's town upgrading shit is such a boring grind
[4:50:06] <%SovPho> It's not really that fun to beat, honestly.
[4:50:09] <dukenux> The game about anxiety, phobias and Eldritch Horror being similarly terrible?
[4:50:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Darkest Dungeon is The Mind Goblin King!
[4:50:14] <%SharkMissile> jesus christ
[4:50:16] <$realm_forge> OMEGA LEVEL GOBLINS
[4:50:16] <Sulliman34> darkest dungeon and xcom have the same problem for me of "oh my dude who i put 30 hours into died! im just supposed to keep going?"
[4:50:17] <cpt_langosta> it is why i will NEVER touch it
[4:50:17] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Are you going to do it with that damn blood expansion that really sucks
[4:50:18] <Goldenwolf98> I love DD but holy shit the goblins hurt lol
[4:50:21] <+DonnyJaBronie> Darkest Dungeon is actually misery to play
[4:50:23] <@ssjklyco> Here's another Mind Goblin game: Doing another souls LP with woolie as you coach him
[4:50:27] <%GabeSweetMan> And it's INTENTIONAL!
[4:50:28] <Goldenwolf98> RIGHT
[4:50:33] <$velgaduere> it fucking owns and hates you for playing it
[4:50:35] <ArguablyEpic> Oh DD’s super great
[4:50:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt what about Blood Bowl where your players can randomly die from any action
[4:50:36] <Brandon__Brando> but I love that about darkest dungeon
[4:50:37] <+MisterAvry> They fucking focused fire and burned down my Vestal, Pat!
[4:50:38] <@Ranryu692> Just get over it then, nerd?
[4:50:39] <$velgaduere> no that's Celeste Pat
[4:50:43] <+DonnyJaBronie> Darkest Dungeon 2: Celeste
[4:50:44] <%madmanrambler> gotta get to the mountain first I imagine
[4:50:44] <dukenux> no Pat, you just played that game
[4:50:45] <+Ardailec> Evidently the Mountain is at the end of the journey
[4:50:49] <+GemeSvev> Darkest Celeste 2
[4:50:51] <+pectusumbra> It's going through levels so the mountain is probably towards the end
[4:50:55] <%zzNamttamzz> Crit 0 Heal rooW
[4:51:08] <ArguablyEpic> “Caravinnn”
[4:51:10] <+MisterAvry> A Mountain of Madness, if you will
[4:51:11] <%chance_h> Omg can’t wait for Celeste to get modded in
[4:51:12] <NeroInfinite> the elder gods
[4:51:18] <%Monkeyweed21> its THROUGH the mountains of madness, not up them
[4:51:18] <AurusD> I actually don't like darkest dungeon. it's not challenging, it's punishing, and it's painful. the class balance also kind of sucks
[4:51:18] <+Emperor_Z> Darkest Dungeon is the type of game that has so many potential mind goblins that I becomes numb to them and become relatively carefree
[4:51:24] <Goldenwolf98> DD2 I have heard is more of a roguelite with less character stuff from what I have heard or something
[4:51:33] <%necarch> necarch subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:51:40] <$realm_forge> And Peach is a hulked out Amazon babe

[4:51:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Gotta go kick Nyarlathotep's ass for being a jerk to humanity.
[4:51:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> weird that they just used a real photo of her for it tho
[4:51:59] <%Bluwizard21> you did good, night pat
[4:52:00] <@goose_attack_almanac> Yeah the game gives me big anxiety. I know its fantastic but big stress
[4:52:02] <cpt_langosta> everyone enjoys BIG PROGRESS
[4:52:03] <AurusD> it's a game where like half of the options or more are traps and I hate it
[4:52:04] <%Evil_John_Cena> shit i'm probably gonna start doing this with my backlog
[4:52:06] <+pectusumbra> It's why I really do prefer what Iratus did for the formula by just giving you levels and say "Make units and go kill them all"
[4:52:07] <Profmcstevie> It's nice watching someone conquer some demons
[4:52:10] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  100+ weeks in Darkest Dungeon can't even scratch the final dungeon
[4:52:13] <%Evil_John_Cena> except not streaming
[4:52:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Am I the only one who thinks Nyarlathotep is WAY more interesting than Cthuhlu?
[4:52:24] <sydowoodo> elmo creeping in the back 👀

[4:52:38] <%ScrapKingKeita> @GabeSweetMan everyone is more interesting than Cthulhu
[4:52:39] <%asgard147> limesS Pat, you sure?
[4:52:44] <+mrredwednesday> DARKEST DUNGEON ChugU
[4:52:46] <%TheHateFish> It's not the full release, Patrick
[4:52:48] <Profmcstevie> Subnautica isn't goblins it's genuine fear
[4:52:52] <+Nobrev> is that day the day pat finally snaps live on stream
[4:52:55] <+Emperor_Z> You are aware that it's early access, right? You won't even be able to reach the actual end yet
[4:52:58] <%Ynkubus_> @GabeSweetMan no, especially when most pnp rpgs use him as a main villain
[4:52:59] <%watchmanfury> fear of ocean
[4:53:04] <%watchmanfury> Ocean is terrifying
[4:53:04] <+mczarklesby> sequence break your mind goblins, straight to the final boss
[4:53:06] <+kknutson4> Is Rimworld on your list?
[4:53:09] <NeroInfinite> It's fear of the sea.
[4:53:10] <Profmcstevie> Oceans fucked dude
[4:53:12] <cpt_langosta> crabfear
[4:53:15] <dukenux> Do you fear deep water?
[4:53:17] <%Monkeyweed21> The ultimate mind goblin game is Fallen London
[4:53:19] <%GabeSweetMan> @Ynkubus_ Good to know.
[4:53:19] <@goose_attack_almanac> dude the ocean sucks.
[4:53:20] <dukenux> Yea, i feel that
[4:53:23] <%ScrapKingKeita> Bathophobia
[4:53:23] <Goldenwolf98> bust out them damn leviathans doodScrub
[4:53:24] <+MisterAvry> yeah that's big ocean shit
[4:53:25] <+Tredecian> and then the fish gets you
[4:53:25] <%dalmek> thalasssaphobia or whatever it's called
[4:53:27] <+FistOcuffs9> yeah
[4:53:28] <ArguablyEpic> Thalassophobia
[4:53:29] <cpt_langosta> large crab
[4:53:30] <%Mr_Pylon> I get anxious in deep water, and playing Subnautica kinda helped with that.
[4:53:31] <+FistOcuffs9> yeah that shits TERRIFYING
[4:53:33] <$realm_forge> Fear of unknown horrors that you can’t see somewhere below you
[4:53:36] <Mattais88> SHARKS
[4:53:37] <dukenux> There's nothing scarier than the blue depth of the sea
[4:53:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> Ark is a fucked up game in terms of chance of getting rocked by shit that came outta nowhere
[4:53:50] <ArguablyEpic> That SOMA shit
[4:53:51] <+RealCynder> I feel weird for not having thalassophobia at this point.
[4:53:53] <%Ynkubus_> @GabeSweetMan most of cthulhus hype stems from people with little knowledge of the mythos
[4:53:55] <%MacMog> just pile crystals on a barge, defeat the ocean
[4:54:00] <%Kemmybelle> I played subnatica in creative mode because it’s too spooky.
[4:54:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> going for a swim only to get stun locked by eels and jellyfish
[4:54:10] <%ScrapKingKeita> Inscryption?
[4:54:10] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt no I BEAT ALL OF IT
[4:54:18] <+paladinstarbuster> if the sea monters were bigger in subnautica i would be scared
[4:54:18] <%GabeSweetMan> My fucked up ears means I will never ever EVER be able to do deep sea diving unless I want to die of the bends super hard.
[4:54:21] <+mrredwednesday> I beat it too
[4:54:21] <+thecowpow> did i miss Celeste stream?
[4:54:36] <%chance_h> Yes @thecowpow
[4:54:37] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I don't know what it is about the ocean, but I would rather walk through hell itself than the ocean
[4:54:38] <+paladinstarbuster> @thecowpow yes
[4:54:40] <%ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt Did you know about the ARG shit going on with it?
[4:54:43] <+Emperor_Z> What game is this?

[4:54:52] <%MacMog> @thecowpow yes, Pat beat like a third of the game and declared victory

[4:57:15] <@Ranryu692> g'night Pat, thanks for strem

[4:58:45] <+pectusumbra> LOSS AVERSION
[4:58:46] <%chance_h> Horny
[4:58:47] <%IronOhki> Got it.
[4:58:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Aaaah.
[4:58:55] <+pectusumbra> One second ahead
[4:58:55] <Profmcstevie> that was my second choice
[4:58:55] <+MisterAvry> oh yeah

[4:58:56] <TheQuadrupleS> DESPAIR
[4:58:57] <+Tredecian> oh thats gonna be rough
[4:58:58] <$realm_forge> Big butt stank gotcha
[4:59:00] <Goergorion> das a big goblin, it has a boss title
[4:59:01] <Saltmeisterr> thats rough
[4:59:02] <%NateyBeak> is this loss?
[4:59:03] <+MisterAvry> understandable
[4:59:09] <ArguablyEpic> That’s two words
[4:59:14] <cpt_langosta> that sounds too close to shrink awareness to me and i don't like it
[4:59:16] <Profmcstevie> 50
[4:59:33] <+Tredecian> unless im a gabling addict
[4:59:37] <%ScrapKingKeita> Was the actual study a 2:1? I thought it was roughly 3:1
[4:59:39] <+mrredwednesday> | | - || _|
[4:59:41] <Profmcstevie> Human Monkee succeed by avoiding loss
[4:59:41] <%SharkMissile> Loss? l_
[4:59:49] <%RayReborne> oh damn
[4:59:53] <%IronOhki> @Tredecian That's the inverse problem.
[4:59:53] <BackflipCharm> All gambling is a scam
[4:59:56] <%RayReborne> thats a BIG one lol
[4:59:57] <%chance_h> Not if you’re a gacha gamer
[5:00:00] <hearingthenseeing> Do you not like gambling in real life?
[5:00:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Why do lootboxes have the inverse affect?
[5:00:04] <%madmanrambler> I mean, I'd jump in at 2 to 1, you're pretty much guaranteed to make money assuming this guy isn't cheating
[5:00:05] <%waltzqueen> PAT WHAT AOUT YOUR GACHA ADDICTION STREAM
[5:00:06] <+mrredwednesday> | | - | _
[5:00:07] <rei0> he said as he kept gambling against paige
[5:00:11] <+lucaflowe> I can see why that would be a problem in a game like Darkest Dungeon
[5:00:24] <+lucaflowe> But you've played gacha which should trigger that as well
[5:00:31] <WaxWitch> gacha is a dark place
[5:00:31] <Profmcstevie> The anti gambler gene
[5:00:54] <lloyddboy> xcom?
[5:00:59] <%SWFanatic> loop hero?
[5:01:07] <%Taisuru> Pat grows more powerful with each goblin defeated
[5:01:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Does the seratonin of lootboxes overpower the loss aversion?
[5:01:12] <NeroInfinite> Loophero is zzz

[5:01:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @waltzqueen we need a stream where pat logins to warframe and gets a 75% off coupon and NEVER uses it

[5:01:43] <%RayReborne> ex i vee
[5:01:46] <%ScrapKingKeita> speaking of Military shooters, is Battlefield still trying to ban Pat from playing with their slogan?
[5:01:55] <%chance_h> Who watches CoD videos anymore guys?
[5:02:07] <Brandon__Brando> probably not
[5:02:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Do you want to die?
[5:02:08] <%Agami23> wait, maiden of black water?
[5:02:12] <%SharkMissile> Then who would Goblin the Goblins?
[5:02:12] <ArguablyEpic> Oh is The Good Life out
[5:02:15] <Profmcstevie> You'll be doing Nothing but FF14 when we get to endwalker
[5:02:17] <+Tredecian> lotta stress
[5:02:26] <+JustToWatch> if the mind goblins are different enough then sure
[5:02:26] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:02:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt would playing Dragons Dogma without a guide to the world states count as anti-goblin
[5:02:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh man so excited for Good Life.
[5:02:32] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> increase the difficulty. you're doing too well on the goblins.
[5:02:36] <BepBepAmShep> might be best to have a palette cleanser stream between mind goblin streams.
[5:02:37] <+pectusumbra> Woolie can do 2 dokapon, you can do 2 gob-o-lin. Probably
[5:02:42] <cpt_langosta> but pat, with the right mindset, any stream can be a goblin stream
[5:02:50] <%TheHateFish> Kingmaker
[5:02:50] <%Agami23> kingmaker
[5:02:50] <%Mr_Pylon> Kingmaker
[5:02:51] <peyodogo> frostpunk
[5:02:53] <+mrredwednesday> king maker
[5:02:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> frostpunk is cool
[5:02:54] <%JoshManVGH> Frostpunk
[5:02:55] <%Kemmybelle> If you like The Good Life would you consider doing a full play though?
[5:02:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Hmmm, not partial to either tbh...
[5:02:56] <+pectusumbra> mmmmm. abstain I'm indifferent on those
[5:02:56] <rei0> frostpunk personally
[5:02:57] <%tebari> Frostpunk
[5:02:58] <NeroInfinite> Frostpuk
[5:02:59] <%SovPho> Kick frostpunk
[5:02:59] <Profmcstevie> ....what is frostpunk in a sentence
[5:03:01] <Brandon__Brando> both are good damn
[5:03:01] <@Ranryu692> I know nothing about either, but Frostpunk is a cool word
[5:03:02] <BackflipCharm> Kingpunk
[5:03:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> i actually dont know what frostpunk even is
[5:03:03] <%Monkeyweed21> kingmaker has big goblins
[5:03:06] <%TheHateFish> @PatStaresAt Set it to a poll
[5:03:06] <%Backfire_Shot> for real hate frostpunk
[5:03:06] <+paladinstarbuster> frostpunk
[5:03:06] <%madmanrambler> I'd be inclined to frostpunk myself, but that's mostly cuz kingmaker just doesn't excite me
[5:03:09] <%Agami23> time for a poll mother fuckers
[5:03:10] <%SovPho> I don't think Frostpunk would be fun to watch
[5:03:12] <churropoppa> poll?
[5:03:12] <Brandon__Brando> frost punk can work for a one off more
[5:03:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Fair enough
[5:03:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> punkmaker
[5:03:22] <@QueequegTheater> Done
[5:03:24] <@goose_attack_almanac> @Profmcstevie "The only furnace in the town is dying. We gotta feed it with criminals"
[5:03:26] <cpt_langosta> Kingpunk: Frostmaker
[5:03:30] <%cvp5127> both
[5:03:39] <%SovPho> Kingpunk is a good band name
[5:03:43] <Profmcstevie> oooh Frostpunk sounds cool then
[5:03:44] <%JoshManVGH> Oh pathfinder kingmaker nvm that's the one
[5:03:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> both at the same time
[5:03:51] <%Monkeyweed21> PUNKMAKER
[5:04:01] <%polothegreatest> psaCaco
[5:04:08] <%SovPho> you're stream

[5:04:11] <%Ne1son> Bang shot ya
[5:04:11] <%SovPho> your stream
[5:04:11] <peyodogo> 🔫
[5:04:12] <%chance_h> Both are hard to quantify in a stream setting, long tactic games
[5:04:12] <Profmcstevie> You better stream frostpunk in Winter gear
[5:04:12] <+pectusumbra> Probably Frostpunk, because if you decide you want to do more kingmaker you want that AFTER Endwalker
[5:04:13] <%cvp5127> but pat loves getting shot
[5:04:13] <%Agami23> pat hates getting shot
[5:04:16] <%JoshManVGH> Democracy has failed us again
[5:04:18] <+SargentToughie> bang bang
[5:04:19] <+Caidezes> Democracy fails once again.
[5:04:20] <%TheHateFish> We're here to watch you, not the game
[5:04:22] <%GabeSweetMan> He hates it.
[5:04:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh shit hes got a gun
[5:04:27] <SinisterBroccoli> How tough is it to get the Law's order weapons in 14?
[5:04:27] <+mrredwednesday> 🔫 saysikerightnow
[5:04:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> @Profmcstevie To be more accurate, it's a game about trying to keep a township alive through a frozen apocalypse. So you gotta balance resources and make unsavory decisions like working the children and what not
[5:04:29] <%polothegreatest> gta TheIlluminati
[5:04:33] <%karovus> frostpunk good game
[5:04:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Fair!
[5:04:51] <%cvp5127> democracy has failed
[5:04:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> Kingmaker does have a strong goblin with the plot-failure calendar
[5:04:55] <Profmcstevie> Work the children? Ooh definitely a Pat game
[5:04:57] <theredfox930000> fear is the mind goblins nzeroMicCheck nzeroMicCheck nzeroPianoMan nzeroPianoMan nzeroSaxMan nzeroDrCello nzeroSaxMan

[5:05:04] <cpt_langosta> play neither and stream Microsoft Bob instead, it's what the people want
[5:05:12] <%JoshManVGH> Why WAS Call of Duty on the schedule in the first place?
[5:05:29] <%SovPho> Teardown's a cool game.
[5:05:35] <Profmcstevie> 4 6 5 2 Frostpunk 6 Age 4 HUT
[5:05:40] <%chance_h> Like what @generalscpatton Pathfinder tends to trigger mind goblins
[5:05:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> Recently I've seen Yakuza 0 be compared to Crisis Core in terms of story placement.
[5:05:53] <+kknutson4> But what about the Guardians of the Galaxy game
[5:06:01] <%cvp5127> nmh3
[5:06:06] <SinisterBroccoli> Are you ever going to go to those B-sides in celeste? some of those tracks are god-tier
[5:06:14] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man... Guardians could be a laugh
[5:06:16] <scarman125> aww I'm I just in time for the stream to end?
[5:06:24] <%SharkMissile> What if Fatal Frame was on Halloween? :0

[5:06:46] <Profmcstevie> Mustard Pumpkins
[5:06:53] <+pectusumbra> Unsighted is supposed to be cool
[5:06:59] <%Backfire_Shot> yo teardown
