[0:02:45] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Hey Pet you can actually get Tali nearly immediately. Immediately visit the Migrant Fleet and Tali joins, and it DOESN'T force you into a mission immediately like Sur Kesh. Tali can come on missions as soon as she joins.

[0:07:37] <PaperyHornet1013> 2
[0:07:37] <%LumberjackJack> Shore leave is Citadel DLC. I advice doing this AFTER you do the ending. End the playthrough on a good note, y'know?
[0:07:41] <%X2Eliah> It's already 3 seconds at 200%
[0:07:42] <%asgard147> MOAR
[0:07:44] <Dunmarkh> two projectiles
[0:07:45] <+AmuserName> Double is cool.
[0:07:46] <%CatRidder> but it can be faster
[0:07:46] <%Faustgesicht> Kai "BITCH" Lang
[0:07:46] <%Axellogic> BUT FASTER
[0:07:47] <%mads_valentine> FASTER FASTER FASTER
[0:07:48] <mikeriffic> IF you give more you can afford heavier weapons
[0:07:50] <SaltyAzteca> MAKE IT FASTERER
[0:07:50] <stantheman_97> it could be faster
[0:07:51] <dekkitout> Speed

[0:08:11] <Hanyusha> one dude every two second versus two dudes every three second
[0:08:11] <%kyh9> Volus ambassador is a good one
[0:08:13] <+Ropcord> poggy
[0:08:19] <mikeriffic> You saying pog isnt very cashmoney of you
[0:08:19] <%shadowsofpain> but imagine the size of your dick if you got recharge speed
[0:08:28] <Blank9> 2 projectiles a 3 seconds is more than 1 projectile at 2 seconds, that's math
[0:08:30] <%trackles_64> Booorg

[0:09:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> I feel like this is an incredibly complex question that's hilariously only has 2 options to choose from in response
[0:09:34] <dekkitout> None. Life is a chemical miracle.
[0:09:35] <Alzero83> Pass on the NUT
[0:09:35] <%X2Eliah> Look, the purpose of synthetic life is sexbots.
[0:09:37] <SaltyAzteca> I mean on the surface yeah....but there's more to it than that
[0:09:38] <%saadi90> To bang
[0:09:41] <ErikFeral> "What is my purpose?" To pass the butter.
[0:09:50] <%maenos2> we find meaning in fucking

[0:10:13] <%lancer1314> One time after talking to EDI, I was shoved up into the ceiling.
[0:10:14] <jorniev> OUR PURPOSE IS TO LIE ABOUT OUR PURPOSE
[0:10:14] <DatAsuna> "brb checking all of human history" "done"

[0:10:38] <%Ipsenscastle> she flipped the switch from 'evil' to 'good'
[0:10:40] <Alzero83> EDI puts in a Spectre Request For Nipple Implants

[0:19:47] <Sp3ctre48> This even sounds like a dumb movie plot
[0:19:57] <%TheHateFish> Two brain cells and they're both dedicated to soldiering
[0:19:58] <quipquest1> Wait, Cerberus and the Collectors were working together?
[0:20:01] <Hanyusha> Because Cerberus is EVIL
[0:20:05] <cpt_langosta> GRAB HIS DICK

[0:22:20] <%Faustgesicht> Garrus is  a good boy.

[0:34:40] <shotgang86> I'm losing my sides over the term "Purple Qussy"
[0:34:40] <DatAsuna> Quarians LOVE genocide
[0:34:41] <+senfood> I can believe it.
[0:34:42] <+Mr_Jackpots25> Do you think the reapers would create a social media app to mass indoctrinate people?
[0:34:42] <%jillyrancher> Based Koris

[0:35:02] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[0:35:02] <Latija> it was only 300 years ago?
[0:35:03] <%faintsmile> koris was right all along
[0:35:03] <PaperyHornet1013> Your lucky your race produced tali

[0:35:05] <+Ropcord> when have quarians ever had good ideas LUL
[0:35:07] <LightningLynx89> Quarians are not wrong
[0:35:07] <%shadowsofpain> Council can't stop them
[0:35:07] <@Ranryu692> too bad
[0:35:07] <%LumberjackJack> It's the option for non-franchise players
[0:35:09] <%Treuan> Tali is literally the only redeeming quality of the quarians
[0:35:10] <%Daxalog> "in case this is your first"
[0:35:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Raans voice Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[0:35:20] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:35:20] <deltamissfits> 100% fine
[0:35:20] <jorniev> WE MUST TAKE JERUSALEM BACK
[0:35:20] <+AmuserName> No one really points it out, but Han Gerrel and Zal Korris swapped model colors between games. Han Gerell used to be in black, and Zal Korris used to be in white and pink.
[0:35:21] <SaltyAzteca> ANALOGY
[0:35:26] <%toastybites> Raan'
[0:35:26] <Vadrigar1994> Drowning the baby is SUPER fine
[0:35:30] <%James_Quivers> Koris is the only one with some sense here
[0:35:31] <%UvBenServed> Deactivate that fetus
[0:35:31] <spongeofmystery> Oh my god that's a perfect analogy
[0:35:32] <%toastybites> so Raan
[0:35:35] <jeppeww> murder is ok if the person was an accident to begin with obviously
[0:35:35] <%Ipsenscastle> Koris knows what's up
[0:35:37] <DatAsuna> Pat's never flushed a baby in a public bathroom?
[0:35:37] <available_line> Quib-Quib is right.
[0:35:37] <dekkitout> "We're just doing a manual rollback of all Geth drivers"
[0:35:39] <LightningLynx89> Quarians did nothing wrong. Fuck the Geth.
[0:35:42] <FassieFons> qwib qwib is right
[0:35:45] <%Treasure_Vault> Again?
[0:35:45] <Ekaelis> Korris being the good goy here LUL
[0:35:47] <%Halospaz117> DAMN YOU AND YOUR SEXY ACCENTS
[0:35:49] <%X2Eliah> You don't even know if they are attractive LUL
[0:35:49] <@Spydurman> damn sexy skin tight robo suits
[0:35:52] <%jillyrancher> Based Zael Koris
[0:35:53] <%trackles_64> this whole quarian thing is a Jewish metaphor
[0:35:56] <%Treasure_Vault> I love the again. Like, really?
[0:35:56] <Latija> they've been here 5 minutes and they're already justifying genocide
[0:35:57] <Profmcstevie> I'm gonna walk around with a pin and make leaks in all their suits
[0:35:58] <DatAsuna> Korris is the only based quarian
[0:36:02] <%X2Eliah> The only thing Quarians have going for them is sexy voices
[0:36:06] <%tinyswampthing> but pat there could be oil
[0:36:11] <%Piemono> Jesus
[0:36:13] <Sp3ctre48> Literally gave the Reapers another army of robots, great
[0:36:20] <PaperyHornet1013> Save the QUSSY
[0:36:20] <zhenthrim213> you forced them to side with the reapers
[0:36:20] <Blackleafx> You drove the Geth to seek the Reapers support
[0:36:24] <@QueequegTheater> Gee I wonder why the fuck they would do something like that, almost like you made them desperate
[0:36:26] <%Treuan> Better throw our civilians into the warzone too
[0:36:26] <stantheman_97> CIVILIANS
[0:36:26] <%faintsmile> civilians too lmao
[0:36:27] <commanderapathy> korris is good boy
[0:36:27] <%redthebaron> at least there are some quarians that get how fucked they are
[0:36:28] <spongeofmystery> It's a real shame you can't purposefully genocide the Quarians yourself
[0:36:31] <%Piemono> Throw the Children in the way of Geth bullets!

[0:40:00] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[0:40:10] <Dame_90> Pay thirsty for the Qussy
[0:40:10] <deltamissfits> hundreds of quarians are dying every hour time to go do side quest's
[0:40:14] <%DrTomT18> oh boy I hope Liara comes on the dreadnought mission
[0:40:15] <teridax4> For every mission you do from now until you save the quarian s just imagine a ship full of orphans exploding
[0:40:17] <Sp3ctre48> Hopefully the Quarians don't blow themselves up or whatever
[0:40:22] <Dommykins> the expanse lady
[0:40:22] <%Afterman_> who is that woman
[0:40:25] <%Afterman_> her voice sounded familiar
[0:40:27] <macathelo> this woman voice give the chills
[0:40:30] <allanmiri> Oh Tali. The only bad part about playing FemShep is that you can't romance her.
[0:40:32] <Profmcstevie> Goddamn sexy Australian voice, stop trying to start war
[0:40:32] <%faintsmile> its fiiiiine the quarians can wait
[0:40:34] <%Afterman_> oh yes
[0:40:35] <%faintsmile> LUL
[0:40:37] <%sandrews> So like are her eyes super bright or does the mask do that?
[0:40:37] <trianglehat> scams?
[0:40:37] <LightningLynx89> The Quarians are far more in the right with than the Geth. The Geth siding with the Reapers is justification for annihilating the flashlights.
[0:40:37] <%Afterman_> shes in expanse
[0:40:38] <+Kqha4000> Lakshmi in D2
[0:40:39] <%Movemeister> Kreygasm
[0:40:53] <%sporeian94> Tali a Admiral, Wrex a King, Virmire Survivor a Spectre, Garrus a high ranking Turian leader, Liara the shadow broker. Everyone moving up in the world
[0:40:54] <Dunmarkh> dafuq is ladar?
[0:40:56] <terrible35> her first name is Shooreh
[0:40:58] <commanderapathy> @allanmiri right?!
[0:40:58] <tanarath> @lightninglynx89 the geth literally keep Rannoch prestine for the Quarians. all of this is the Quarians' fault
[0:40:59] <cpt_langosta> garbage data? you mean lore?
[0:41:00] <terrible35> iirc
[0:41:02] <AngryAsian5> Shohreh Aghdashloo
[0:41:03] <macathelo> yes and she's super hot
[0:41:09] <dekkitout> Ladar as in laser
[0:41:13] <Blackleafx> Geth did nothing wrong
[0:41:14] <deltamissfits> ladar is like radar but with lazers
[0:41:19] <dekkitout> Instead of radio
[0:41:19] <Hanyusha> so they just bruteforce through the garbage data?
[0:41:21] <%James_Quivers> Ladar is Japanese Radar
[0:41:27] <FlyguyJP> Using lasers inside of radio waves
[0:41:30] <Sp3ctre48> It's so much the Quarian's fault that I kinda hate how one sided it is in this game
[0:41:31] <Astrophizz> lidar
[0:41:35] <LightningLynx89> @tanarath Geth literally genocided the Quarians. 99% of all Quarians are dead because of the Geth.
[0:41:39] <+ATorL> laser is also, iirc
[0:41:40] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt The laser rangefinder is "Lidar" not "ladar"
[0:41:40] <FassieFons> ladar is radar but gooder?
[0:41:41] <$SGrim> @James_Quivers boo this man
[0:41:43] <+Bigbossman91> @LightningLynx89 the Geth sided with the Reapers because the Quarians attacked them so no they are not in the right at all
[0:41:45] <M0untain_wolf> Fuking Lazers and shit
[0:41:45] <+Eiiriika> we'll bang ladar, okay?
[0:41:46] <dekkitout> The more you know 🌈 🌟
[0:41:48] <%Afterman_> Shohreh is a damn good actress
[0:41:49] <Astrophizz> with lasers it's LIDAR
[0:41:51] <%MelBrooksKA> The correct acronym is LIDAR @PatStaresAt
[0:41:52] <Dunmarkh> Neat
[0:41:52] <%faintsmile> @LightningLynx89 had it coming LUL
[0:41:52] <%RustyCoyoteA> It's LIDAR tho
[0:41:57] <%FunkyStreams> cool
[0:41:59] <+ScrapKingKeita> laser is also an acronym
[0:41:59] <deltamissfits> its very good for maping stuff
[0:42:02] <+Daedalus119> @X2Eliah it's both, but usually lidar
[0:42:09] <cpt_langosta> and I'll help you repopulate that homeworld!
[0:42:09] <%TheHateFish> That'd be Laser Imaging Detection And Ranging
[0:42:15] <Alzero83> Bender has Gaydar, dont forget
[0:42:16] <%sporeian94> light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
[0:42:18] <jeppeww> incentive means FICK
[0:42:22] <M0untain_wolf> For Real
[0:42:23] <%Torus1025> @bigbossman91  And they were right to do so
[0:42:25] <%James_Quivers> HELP YOUR PEOPLE BY LETTING ME BANG YOU, TALI
[0:42:28] <Hanyusha> THERE ARE LITERALLY REAPERS ON YOUR HOMEWORLD
[0:42:29] <%sporeian94> "It"
[0:42:31] <Blackleafx> @LightningLynx89 Quarians tried to wipe out a sapient new species, new species fought back, wow how DARE they fight back
[0:42:33] <DatAsuna> @RustyCoyoteA yeah it's Light Detection and Ranging, but close enough
[0:42:33] <Hanyusha> WHAT DO YOU MEAN
[0:42:33] <%faintsmile> she learned!!!
[0:42:34] <RaidenRising> the D
[0:42:37] <LightningLynx89> @Bigbossman91 If an alien race sides with the genocidal robot squids. Fuck em. Deactivate them.
[0:42:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WTF kind of answer was that, Tali? YOu're people won't need you if they're all dead
[0:42:40] <tanarath> @lightninglynx89 genocide? you mean what the quarians were doing after the slaves asked if they could be people too?

[0:42:47] <%Halospaz117> yeah, go qwib qwib
[0:42:55] <mrblitzstream> sup guys, what have i missed?
[0:42:56] <LightningLynx89> @LightningLynx89 AIs don't deserve sentience.
[0:43:00] <DatAsuna> Tali straight telling you korris is the only non racist
[0:43:02] <%Ghufufin> Legion is a Gamer, u cant trust Gamers
[0:43:02] <Sp3ctre48> For real though there were billions of Quarian's and there were 17 million left after the war, the Geth had a right to defend themselves but they went overboard
[0:43:12] <Blackleafx> @LightningLynx89 cringe
[0:43:13] <zhenthrim213> @LightningLynx89 sounding like Javik here dude
[0:43:15] <mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt I recently read an article where scientists conclude that space aliens will NOT be fuckable most likely and like a morning news anchor I decided to ignore that science
[0:43:19] <deltamissfits> its like worrying about the Russians when the sun is exploding

[0:44:24] <%faintsmile> quarians deserved everything they got
[0:44:24] <%Archmortal> @LightningLynx89 so you're saying sapient life should just let itself be genocided instead of defending itself

[0:44:36] <@QueequegTheater> Which they responded to with their own genocide attempts
[0:44:37] <LightningLynx89> And yet the Geth then genocided 99% of all Quarians.
[0:44:37] <allanmiri> I CAN NOT WAIT for Pat to see the part where the game practically castrates Kai Leng on screen.
[0:44:40] <%DashXero> Yeah. But they're AI.

[0:44:47] <%toastybites> yeah but then they started helping the reapers for other genocide
[0:44:48] <mikeriffic> and the geth dont hold a grudge
[0:44:51] <%JoshManVGH> They never even pursued the Quarians as they retreated.
[0:44:52] <SaltyAzteca> @TheHateFish Now he is a gamer. The most oppressed class Kappa
[0:44:52] <Sp3ctre48> They almost completely exterminated the Quarians in self defense
[0:44:52] <AngryAsian5> BuT Ai IS BAd tHo
[0:44:52] <Profmcstevie> I WILL DEFEND MYSELF UNTIL THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF MY ENEMY
[0:44:56] <olaksi> @QueequegTheater no?
[0:44:57] <Blackleafx> One Fellow
[0:44:59] <@Lion_kun> The Quarians are totally in the wrong.
[0:44:59] <%DrTomT18> the geth have NEVER wanted to fight.
[0:45:01] <terrible35> keep digging that hole and maybe you'll die on that hill
[0:45:07] <%Archmortal> @LightningLynx89 what you're missing here is that Quarians lost so many BECAUSE THEY KEPT ATTACKING
[0:45:08] <BurdRightsActivist> Quarians: You missed that one, try another!
[0:45:10] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> they are HIDEOUS BEHIND THOSE VISORS
[0:45:10] <%X2Eliah> MORE WAR CRIMES
[0:45:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That people still say the Geth took it too far are insane. It was a war of ETERMINATION. That there are any Quarian AT ALL means they OBVIOUSLY didn't take it too far.
[0:45:13] <cpt_langosta> SPACE GENEVA CONVENTION
[0:45:18] <%faintsmile> god theyre such fucking assholes
[0:45:18] <+AmuserName> WE PUT CANNONS ON OUR FARMING SHIPS 4Head
[0:45:18] <FlyguyJP> Ah there's the Minivan with a tank turret
[0:45:18] <+GuilKato> Geth are in the right BUT! they could have relocated out of the quaraian home world - they're logic based beings they have no emotional attachment to Rannoch - they could have left into uncharted unmapped relay space @PatStaresAt
[0:45:21] <AngryAsian5> Civilian ships with BIG GUNS
[0:45:24] <%Zalapski> fuck the quarians
[0:45:27] <jbrachob> AND even now they  take care of the planet waiting for the quarians to stop being assholes
[0:45:29] <+RoByte2> "When the creators have believed victory is possible, they have attacked us 100 percent of the time."
[0:45:32] <IvanMistwalker> chat is filled with Quarian Apologist
[0:45:33] <Sp3ctre48> Now I hate the Quarians but the Geth have some responsibility in perpetuating the conflict
[0:45:34] <+senfood> Ask for forgiveness instead of permission.
[0:45:34] <%Meekest> How can you see them say this and side with them
[0:45:34] <mikeriffic> So the Geth wouldnt fire on those ships if they had no guns
[0:45:36] <%DrTomT18> BIG GUNS NEVER TIRE
[0:45:37] <%DianaTheAscian> Damn it I will never get used to Pat starting this early
[0:45:40] <Profmcstevie> Get attempted genocide "no you can't fight back this much that's too much BibleThump "
[0:45:40] <$SGrim> Citizen soldiers... COMMUNISTS!
[0:45:41] <%faintsmile> arent theyre children and babies on those ships
[0:45:42] <RaidenRising> BIG WAR CRIME
[0:45:44] <tanarath> 'not casually, but we still will do it'
[0:45:45] <@Lion_kun> The Quarians did this to themselves. They could have colonised a new planet if they wanted.
[0:45:45] <%Treasure_Vault> Kind of reminds me of Q-ships
[0:45:52] <LightningLynx89> @Archmortal Geth are still in the wrong for killing 99% of the entire species.
[0:45:53] <Dunmarkh> you mean the geth homeworld
[0:45:55] <Ekaelis> Oof, putting a gun on a tub doesn't turn it into a dreadnought, they're basically glass cannons
[0:45:57] <%moonmintparadise> THIS IS SO STUPID HOW IS A FLOATING PUMPKIN PATCH SUPPOSED TO FIGHT IN A WAR
[0:45:59] <cpt_langosta> they literally said they were keeping it warm for the quarians' peaceful return
[0:46:01] <%Deano8817> oh they totally would have
[0:46:04] <DatAsuna> Oh, also if Tali is dead, Raan is the one who joins you on missions.
[0:46:07] <PaperyHornet1013> abandon tali and leave the qussy to die
[0:46:08] <Laecerelius> I'm pretty sure that the Turians would have gone ballistic if the geth tried to go anywhere else
[0:46:10] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Geth are said to be orbiting in station above world
[0:46:12] <FlyguyJP> Not just the Quarians, the Council blacklists AIs as SUPER illegal
[0:46:14] <%DrTomT18> also the council hate AI even if they are friendly
[0:46:15] <$SGrim> @moonmintparadise Potato guns
[0:46:15] <%Treasure_Vault> Geth killed 99% of Quarians. Quarians tried to kill 100% of geths
[0:46:16] <%faintsmile> its One Guy pat LOL
[0:46:16] <Profmcstevie> EVERY TIME THE GETH TRY AND CHILL ABOUT IT, QUARIANS ATTACK
[0:46:17] <ChungusQuest> Who is to say the Geth aren't emotional, anyway?
[0:46:18] <djsporty> Also gives the Quarians a base of operations
[0:46:20] <%LumberjackJack> Not to mention the logistics and resources to just MOVE AN ENTIRE RACE
[0:46:21] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> @AmuserName YES ! prepare de Super ElectroMagnetic Shrepnal Cannon Voltage Engage !
[0:46:22] <%Archmortal> @LightningLynx89 so yes, you're saying people should just let themselves be murdered when attacked
[0:46:24] <Blackleafx> @Archmortal Quarians were in the wrong for sending 99% of their population into the meatgrinder
[0:46:24] <%DashXero> Because Quarians suck.
[0:46:24] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> The quarians would also probably snitch and then the whole galaxy would the the geth further
[0:46:27] <%Treasure_Vault> Stop running into our woodchipper, quarians
[0:46:27] <%dredgyboi> the quarians Killed QUARIANS to get to the geth
[0:46:30] <PunchSlugfest> its a war of Qussy vs Gussy
[0:46:30] <deltamissfits> they say in 2 that most geth live in space around the planet
[0:46:32] <%DrTomT18> the Council committed AI genocide
[0:46:32] <%VioletHeart> I believe in ME2 Legion says that the Geth were repairing Rannoch from the scars of the war. They're repairing it for the quarians.
[0:46:35] <BurdRightsActivist> QUARIANS LUL
[0:46:36] <Sp3ctre48> The Geth attacked everything that came into former Quarian space whether it was a threat to them or not
[0:46:38] <allanmiri> "IF YOU KILL ME I'LL KILL YOU HARDER!!!"
[0:46:38] <Dova573> Even the kids
[0:46:39] <%Archmortal> Pat, it is not people, it is ONE GUY who just keeps repeating it
[0:46:39] <FlyguyJP> If the Geth attempted to mass migrate somewhere else then I could see the Council races moving to intervene
[0:46:40] <Dova573> ?
[0:46:45] <commanderapathy> @lightninglynx89 the quarians wouldn't have been genocided had the not KEPT ATTACKING
[0:46:46] <LightningLynx89> @Archmortal Yes. AI do not deserve sentience.
[0:46:47] <+GuilKato> oh i meant after the fleet existed - in the intervening 300 years the geth could have relocated elsewhere - all stealthy like :D
[0:46:48] <Tracazoid> So Quarians vs Geth is just Tucker and Dale vs Evil
[0:46:49] <El_GhostV1> Quarian's shot first
[0:46:51] <+senfood> Saying the Quarians handled the existential crisis of the geth poorly is an understatement.
[0:46:56] <PaperyHornet1013> Get the GUSSY leave the QUSSY
[0:47:03] <%DrTomT18> Legion can't fucking lie lmao
[0:47:08] <terrible35> @Archmortal good thing you dont get to determine that
[0:47:15] <%Archmortal> @LightningLynx89 whether AI deserve sapience is moot, they already have sapience.
[0:47:15] <FassieFons> all of the rationalizations people give that put the geth in the wrong can be easily written around within the existing lore
[0:47:19] <%DashXero> They're gonna wait for a long time.
[0:47:21] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> I do like when games have a conflict that people still argue about years after the fact LUL

[0:48:33] <Alzero83> Time to INvite Tali up!
[0:48:33] <dekkitout> Secret handshake
[0:48:34] <%DrTomT18> @projectmanatees every stream is now Kai Leng dunking stream
[0:48:35] <%LumberjackJack> Data pad. It's off-screen
[0:48:37] <+SaphronBlackbourne> For some reason I have no sympathy towards AI so I'm cool w/ the Quarians
[0:48:37] <@QueequegTheater> @TrueSpaceBaron Qussy
[0:48:38] <allanmiri> Considering Tali's immune system she'd be the perfect waifu for Pat which is why I asked.
[0:48:40] <terrible35> Quarians getting BTFO evertime LUL
[0:48:40] <Zombrocom> You gave her an ipad
[0:48:42] <deltamissfits> the live ship thing is like if you put guns on a apartment blocks and rolled them into afganistan
[0:48:44] <%Treasure_Vault> Pat doesn't even realize how right he is
[0:48:48] <MiamiMemory> @TrueSpaceBaron  Wrex
[0:48:48] <Blackleafx> @LightningLynx89 Why don't AI deserves to exist?
[0:48:48] <%MidnightBurst12> emote only seems like overkill
[0:48:49] <+projectmanatees> @DrTomT18 thats a lot to watch
[0:48:50] <@Lion_kun> Do you wanna switch to subscribers or emote mode only?
[0:48:50] <FlyguyJP> Pat was so smart he didn't even know it

[0:48:54] <AngryAsian5> GALAXY BRAIN
[0:49:00] <SaltyAzteca> Life is just one big videogame, and Pat is the protagonist
[0:49:00] <cpt_langosta> he has a new joker trick involving a pencil
[0:49:01] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> @strakillias why
[0:49:02] <El_GhostV1> pat should've written mass effect

[0:49:37] <deltamissfits> no boning for you only nice talked
[0:49:37] <LightningLynx89> @LightningLynx89 AI deserves to only exist in the subservience of organic life. Never to succeed it, or gain sentience. So I am diametrically oppose to the existence of the Geth as a whole.
[0:49:42] <Blackleafx> ye

[0:49:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The amount of people mad that the Geth are 100% in the right and they have to defend the indefensible due to their waifu is great LUL
[0:49:55] <FlyguyJP> The Quarians were also just following Council AI requlations too. ANY other race would have also suppressed AIs too

[0:55:43] <LightningLynx89> @zhenthrim213 I have. I understand, however DATA is designed to experience human emotion. Doesn't mean I don't want sentient AI.
[0:55:44] <%sporeian94> there's nothing in the far rim
[0:55:46] <MiamiMemory> Goku drip hits differently now.
[0:55:46] <zhenthrim213> liar
[0:55:49] <dekkitout> Dripping, clappin, burnin. We learning today
[0:55:49] <%maenos2> BWAAAM
[0:55:58] <FlyguyJP> Lies sweet little lies

[0:56:07] <%X2Eliah> aww yeah time to scan
[0:56:08] <%sporeian94> There's also nothing in the perseus veil for assets
[0:56:10] <%MelBrooksKA> Who would ever do that
[0:56:15] <SaltyAzteca> Chav Reapers
[0:56:15] <olaksi> chat doesn't lie, it's in truth superposition
[0:56:19] <mrblitzstream> never trust the chat
[0:56:25] <Gruhunchously> This was the era where every piece of media was obsessed with the Inception BWAAAAAAAM
[0:56:26] <+condemned_15> Reapies' Pieces
[0:56:29] <terrible35> chat is filled with sociopaths, as proved by tonigh
[0:56:30] <%MelBrooksKA> No one here would ever lie to Pat
[0:56:34] <zhenthrim213> @LightningLynx89 so your argument is they should only experince human emotion when we tell them too
[0:56:35] <mrblitzstream> chat is chaotic evil
[0:56:38] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> We're gon a give those reapies the ol razzle dizzle
[0:56:45] <%jillyrancher> Do the Asari Monastery mission Pat its awesome
[0:56:46] <MiamiMemory> Chad Reapers vs. the virgin Protheans
[0:56:51] <allanmiri> I'm not kidding Shepard pretty much just rips Kai Leng's penis right off on screen! ... sorta.
[0:56:51] <BurdRightsActivist> AYO BRUV that reaper looks like me uncle timmy, pretty stewpid INNIT?
[0:56:53] <%X2Eliah> Yeah the BWAAAM really dates this game
[0:56:55] <LightningLynx89> @zhenthrim213 Yeah. Unfortunately.
[0:56:58] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> PLAUGE?
[0:56:59] <Profmcstevie> STD ending?
[0:57:00] <%jillyrancher> Innit
[0:57:01] <%DrTomT18> fable?
[0:57:01] <%shurtal> and complain about fences
[0:57:02] <Sp3ctre48> So giving Atlus new ideas
[0:57:03] <FlyguyJP> Literally killing your crew
[0:57:03] <commanderapathy> @trollking96 it's mainly turians and quarians who have genetic problems
[0:57:05] <%tempestzephyr> that's real life
[0:57:07] <mikeriffic> I think those exist
[0:57:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Have to watch a meter to prevent a spread of PlagueofGripes!?
[0:57:08] <%James_Quivers> Paz means Peace
[0:57:08] <%AkronymCLT> does the S in STD stand for Shepard?
[0:57:09] <$SGrim> Mega SYPHILIS
[0:57:09] <terrible35> too real
[0:57:09] <dekkitout> I think the first hunniepop made a joke like that
[0:57:12] <@commanderclaw> The D Link System
[0:57:13] <%faintsmile> dont become a dating sim dev pat
[0:57:15] <mrblitzstream> so the Walking DEAD PAT
[0:57:15] <deltamissfits> one char has VD if you fuck them you give everyone VD but its randomized when you start the game
[0:57:15] <Zombrocom> Chat is a thousand voices shouting in unison, it's going to be right and wrong simultaneously every time
[0:57:16] <%jillyrancher> Wanna shag
[0:57:17] <allanmiri> There's a New Vegas mod that does that.
[0:57:18] <stantheman_97> i can think of a couple sex games with that
[0:57:20] <TheAntiNihilist> @gruhunchously thats because it's timelessly awesome
[0:57:20] <%demiiluna> I think some groups might find that in poor taste
[0:57:20] <%dooscent> you go to hook up with the DLC character and you get !! CAUGHT THE PLAGUE !!
[0:57:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> That sounds like fable
[0:57:21] <%Movemeister> The drip stat
[0:57:26] <zhenthrim213> @LightningLynx89 you know what i kinda agree
[0:57:26] <Profmcstevie> Persona 6 romance ending gone awry
[0:57:29] <+Solarint> pat wants to stack up those debuffs
[0:57:31] <FlyguyJP> Pat is tickled pink by STDs

[0:57:42] <%Daxalog> Sex?
[0:57:42] <%lloyddboy> weird flex but ok
[0:57:43] <+Eiiriika> I thought that sentence was gonna end different....
[0:57:44] <stantheman_97> it's never too late!

[0:57:49] <$SGrim> Sure
[0:57:49] <Necnill> Don't lie on the internet
[0:57:49] <MiamiMemory> @patstaresat Have you probed Uranus yet?
[0:57:51] <Blank9> harvester has a VD debuff
[0:57:51] <smoothwood07> very fortunate
[0:57:52] <@QueequegTheater> But she lives in Canada, right Kappa
[0:57:55] <%Daxalog> Evidence?
[0:57:55] <%xcompleasedad> Almost certainly
[0:57:58] <%tempestzephyr> psaWrong

[0:58:17] <intestinal_bleeding> SsssEeeeeex
[0:58:18] <%Treasure_Vault> There is no sex in Canada.
[0:58:22] <FlyguyJP> BWAAAM
[0:58:24] <LightningLynx89> @zhenthrim213 Listen. I understand the Geth. And I understand AI in fiction. However that's fiction. If AI are as logical based as we imagine they can be. Then no doubt they would seek to eliminate organic life, due to the threat they pose.
[0:58:28] <Gruhunchously> lol
[0:58:32] <@commanderclaw> These reapers sound like bass boosted Geese
[0:58:36] <mrblitzstream> BWWAAAM

[0:59:10] <dekkitout> Space-geese. I like tha
[0:59:11] <+Mr_Jackpots25> Do you think there’s a reaper the other reapers don’t like? Personally, I imagine the human reaper would be pretty annoying, memeing all the time.
[0:59:12] <FlyguyJP> GAS
[0:59:14] <MiamiMemory> Reapers be brapping all over the galaxy
[0:59:17] <+tigerfang86> you..... did it

[1:00:40] <LightningLynx89> @commanderapathy No. Because AI will not be so kind to humanity or organic life if we do not actively suppress their functions to gain sentience. AI will never be kind to organics.

[1:00:58] <tanarath> Why would you pay todd?
[1:00:58] <%Treasure_Vault> Skyrim would be good if it was Morrowind.
[1:01:00] <%DrTomT18> I seriously wander what those 500 mods will be
[1:01:01] <dekkitout> I wonder if Pat can 100%* Skyrim before I can finish configuring mods

[1:04:06] <JetpackMcQuack> what a renegade
[1:04:09] <%Movemeister> LUL
[1:04:09] <BurdRightsActivist> AUTHORITY - IMPOSSIBLE
[1:04:10] <%cvp5127> butt
[1:04:10] <Mattais88> Claymore
[1:04:11] <$realm_forge> Liara would just ink all over tali’s face plate
[1:04:13] <@QueequegTheater> Claymore
[1:04:13] <%X2Eliah> Eh, whatever
[1:04:14] <allanmiri> "MUU JUST RUMB SOME DISINFECTANT ON LIARARARA IT"LL WORK!"
[1:04:15] <$hattrick61> Claymore
[1:04:15] <FlyguyJP> Fast firing
[1:04:15] <$SGrim> Big gun
[1:04:15] <Dunmarkh> KROGAN SHOTGUN
[1:04:16] <PaperyHornet1013> use good guns
[1:04:17] <acridpaladin> yea. the gun that shoots
[1:04:18] <OtakuSnake1> Just kiss the helmet. Draw kissy lips on it
[1:04:18] <%jillyrancher> Liara just be like "Idk maybe"
[1:04:19] <DatAsuna> reegar is a quarian shotgun
[1:04:19] <%James_Quivers> Reegar Carbine, Quarian weapon
[1:04:20] <+Sendrak70> Use good ones
[1:04:20] <mrblitzstream> scorpion
[1:04:21] <Sp3ctre48> Wraith and Acolyte
[1:04:21] <%count_bob> N7 crusader
[1:04:21] <deltamissfits> big shotgun thats all she need
[1:04:21] <@commanderclaw> The heavy shit
[1:04:23] <MiamiMemory> BLACK WIDOW
[1:04:25] <%Puhff> Who cares about lore; just make it sexy.
[1:04:26] <tanarath> geth?
[1:04:27] <$hattrick61> Give tali big shootbang
[1:04:28] <stantheman_97> you just want every rpg protag to be a unapologetic scumbag
[1:04:29] <LightningLynx89> @commanderapathy If you choose to belittle the actual threat that AI presents to organic life. Then sure. I've read so many papers on how even the top engineers and scientists who go "AI are dangerous, we need to be careful."
[1:04:30] <$SGrim> Phalynx is good
[1:04:30] <DatAsuna> Also the Reegar is named after he buddy in 2
[1:04:30] <+bear_breaker20> @DrTomT18 gonna need some sauce on that
[1:04:31] <Dunmarkh> executioner
[1:04:32] <%DJFakie> Eagle,
[1:04:34] <%trackles_64> Krogan pistol slaps
[1:04:34] <+AmuserName> Claymore and Scorpion is neat.
[1:04:35] <%DrTomT18> the blue one
[1:04:36] <DatAsuna> So the reegar is also lore appropriate
[1:04:42] <%DJFakie> Eagle is a full auto pistol
[1:04:45] <%count_bob> crusader
[1:04:47] <allanmiri> It has weight Pat.
[1:04:49] <+TrevSmith222> The Talon is basically a shotgun in pistol form.
[1:04:51] <cpt_langosta> equip only a VERY large crab
[1:04:52] <tanarath> give tali the executioner pistol
[1:04:53] <PaperyHornet1013> regar combine
[1:04:54] <%xcompleasedad> Scorpion is LIT
[1:04:55] <%DJFakie> Crusader is a slug shotgun
[1:04:56] <Mobilebeardunit> that salarian grenade pistol?
[1:04:58] <Sp3ctre48> Reegar would be fun too since it's a Quarian weapon
[1:04:59] <El_GhostV1> Clayless
[1:04:59] <jimmytwofeet> Scorpion Pistol is is sticky bombs
[1:05:00] <commanderapathy> @lightninglynx89 okay sure
[1:05:01] <%trackles_64> claymore sucks
[1:05:06] <dekkitout> Pretty sure that shotgun weighs more than she does
[1:05:10] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There's an elite enemy here that can melee one-shot you. AVOID CHARGING IT.
[1:05:14] <deltamissfits> does the claymore not just break the arms of everyone but krogans?
[1:05:18] <cpt_langosta> they were talking about the anime
[1:05:18] <%lloyddboy> ONE GUY
[1:05:18] <DatAsuna> Reegar, it's named after her friend
[1:05:19] <Sp3ctre48> The Claymore is great though
[1:05:20] <%ahomeschooldropout> Spike Thrower tbh
[1:05:23] <@commanderclaw> Fuck that guy, the Claymore is great
[1:05:24] <+Sendrak70> a better gun
[1:05:25] <DatAsuna> it's also top tier damage
[1:05:25] <%DrTomT18> @bear_breaker20 if you play a female Shepard and date Garrus, during the party on the Citidel, she will drunkenly talk about wanting to have a threesome
[1:05:27] <+GuilKato> reager'
[1:05:28] <%trackles_64> the alliance shotgun
[1:05:30] <MemMoor> one guy
[1:05:33] <%DJFakie> Crusader or Wraith
[1:05:39] <jbrewski12> Reegar is bad because ai doesn't know how to use it properly
[1:05:41] <%DrTomT18> n7 shotgun
[1:05:42] <Laecerelius> Tali will user her zappy gun to stop them!
[1:05:42] <godila2> wraith should be good
[1:05:43] <%DJFakie> That works though
[1:05:45] <Aiutare47> Reegar doesn’t play well with Tali because it forces her to get close, and tali’s health ain’t great.
[1:05:54] <deltamissfits> the aliance shotgun if the best for AI imo
[1:05:59] <Gruhunchously> I like the Mirror's Edge music in the background here
[1:06:06] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> I'm glad the weapon balance in this game is well managed.
[1:06:10] <tanarath> Executioner pistol?
[1:06:12] <MarylandJutsu> yeah cause you were like its an asari weapon
[1:06:14] <+AmuserName> Scorpion = Sticky Grenade Pistol
[1:06:18] <FlyguyJP> I always go for magazine size and rate of fire with AI
[1:06:24] <%kyh9> Is this that misison?
[1:06:26] <allanmiri> It's okay Pat. Take your time. The more time you take the more we get to stare at that Quarian booty.
[1:06:28] <%X2Eliah> Weird part is, Acolyte used to be a shotgun.
[1:06:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Oh no he's using Liara? Garrus and EDI have great dialogue in this one
[1:06:33] <%DJFakie> Weapon weight affects AI cooldowns too
[1:06:33] <KeiPrime> idk why the equip screen show their back instead of them holding the weapon but
[1:06:36] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[1:06:37] <%DrTomT18> give Tali the blue pistol
[1:06:37] <%Broand> I'm liking the variety of guns available
[1:06:41] <%jillyrancher> Yo Pat you can get a badass shotgun in this mission
[1:06:41] <%X2Eliah> what is going on lol
[1:06:43] <%Archmortal> Anything that needs to charge to fire is bad
[1:06:47] <%Archmortal> for AI
[1:06:53] <%jillyrancher> The Disciple shotgun fucking FUCKS.
[1:06:57] <DatAsuna> AP is bad on acolyte cause it's a concussion shot
[1:07:00] <%James_Quivers> none a dis matters
[1:07:03] <deltamissfits> they are all kinda blue
[1:07:05] <commanderapathy> tali kills with the claymore
[1:07:07] <%DrTomT18> black, white, blue!
[1:07:09] <DatAsuna> he doesn't have disciple yet
[1:07:13] <%maenos2> god let him do whatever guys
[1:07:18] <Profmcstevie> Who caaares if they die they die we're shotgun king
[1:07:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Uh oh
[1:07:24] <dekkitout> DOUBLE DOWN tajC
[1:07:24] <FlyguyJP> Google can possibly be wrong
[1:07:25] <%jillyrancher> I know hell get it this mission
[1:07:27] <SkinnyRite> How about a number since there are 8 of them
[1:07:27] <DatAsuna> Just pick whatever looks coolest for her aesthetic
[1:07:38] <%MidnightBurst12> it don't matta
[1:07:39] <Aiutare47> Now we’re in for it
[1:07:42] <DatAsuna> Tali's useful for her powers and not her gun anyway
[1:07:48] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Weapon choice only seems to matter for garrus, anyway.
[1:07:50] <thebalticguy1> EXPOSE IS BETTER
[1:07:57] <MiamiMemory> None of dis mattas
[1:07:58] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Drones for Tali! Big drones!
[1:08:00] <+Sendrak70> we all know that the companions are only there to draw fire away from the main character.
[1:08:02] <DatAsuna> so rule of aesthetic is fine on her
[1:08:19] <deltamissfits> i lvoe the drones so much
[1:08:22] <%andrewofbob> andrewofbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Twitch is nagging me that my sub has hit 3 months; does this mean I need to get it some new baby clothes?
[1:08:22] <cpt_langosta> "Immune system" should be one of Tali's upgradable traits
[1:08:25] <deltamissfits> they are so dumb
[1:08:26] <%X2Eliah> Drones are great for drawing enemy fire
[1:08:32] <Dunmarkh> Finally, a female drone pilot
[1:08:33] <@commanderclaw> A single point in the hack skill is good
[1:08:34] <+AmuserName> Energy Drain and Combat Drone are good. Energy drain is basically Overload.
[1:08:37] <%LumberjackJack> Defense drone blows. Combat drone is fucking great in ME3
[1:08:41] <%Jmann1892> Energy Drain is good
[1:08:43] <%xcompleasedad> ENERGY DRAIN
[1:08:50] <allanmiri> I love anything that gives you a little robot buddy to shoot the bad guys.
[1:08:50] <cpt_langosta> *explosion*
[1:08:52] <commanderapathy> @sendrak70 you're out of line, but you're right
[1:08:53] <%count_bob> explode
[1:08:53] <MiamiMemory> BETTER DRONE
[1:08:53] <Dunmarkh> explode
[1:08:54] <%kyh9> explode
[1:08:55] <Sp3ctre48> Energy drain is overload and shield recovery, it's great
[1:08:58] <%andrewofbob> Explody drone is only good for player drones
[1:09:00] <GustauveVIII> i dont trust the drones to not die
[1:09:01] <DatAsuna> Energy drain is only good if you're doing combos
[1:09:05] <PaperyHornet1013> I love you wife and practice wife
[1:09:18] <voodoolawyer> did he pick up her upgrade item quest from Sugondese?
[1:09:19] <Dunmarkh> sounds good
[1:09:20] <DatAsuna> CC always better than damage for NPCs
[1:09:20] <tanarath> Energy Drain might be great, pat.
[1:09:21] <%xcompleasedad> Energy Drain, it’s amazing for killing shields
[1:09:24] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Btw energy drain restores shields, you might want to consider it too
[1:09:24] <cpt_langosta> picking explode, then increasing drone health is kinda counter-productive
[1:09:31] <MiamiMemory> Pat, have you seen the movie Hackers?
[1:09:36] <@Ranryu692> chain lightning is pretty great
[1:09:38] <mrblitzstream> Pulse
[1:09:39] <Aiutare47> All her powers are pretty good but especially good against geth
[1:09:49] <%kyh9> zap
[1:09:49] <DatAsuna> Energy drain is great, but not for the way he plays
[1:10:00] <FlyguyJP> In the immortal words of Carl: "Just do whatevah. This don't mattah. None of this mattahs."
[1:10:09] <%X2Eliah> Arwight
[1:10:13] <%Meekest> What an awkward team
[1:10:16] <deltamissfits> oooooo this one
[1:10:17] <Gruhunchously> High Command?

[1:10:21] <%maenos2> oh it IS THIS one
[1:10:25] <trianglehat> oh this bit
[1:10:26] <@Ranryu692> ooh, this mission
[1:10:26] <%Treasure_Vault> Didn't Morinth have sisters?

[1:10:47] <bearintonegaming> Oh fuck this mission
[1:10:51] <Gruhunchously> The Right of Annulment
[1:11:09] <$realm_forge> The asari got tired of them inking everywhere
[1:11:11] <%DrTomT18> the one time you should have brought Garrus
[1:11:11] <+Mr_Jackpots25> Turn off chat, people already can’t shut up.
[1:11:12] <cpt_langosta> dat ass is too powerful
[1:11:14] <voodoolawyer> in ME 2 the true good ending is death by snu snu
[1:11:18] <Mobilebeardunit> the Reaper enemy type concept art had so many cool aliens
[1:11:21] <%trackles_64> screw the rardat yakshi died so many times on insanity.
[1:11:25] <%kyh9> They can death-orgy
[1:11:29] <Gruhunchously> Astronomical levels of sex kills?
[1:11:30] <allanmiri> So have you heard the lore that Asari are might project their from into people's minds that make them look like their species so they might be gross tentacle monsters.
[1:11:30] <ChungusQuest> oh boy, here we go
[1:11:37] <%unhuggable1> weird lip syncing on this mission
[1:11:39] <Sp3ctre48> Sex murderers too strong
[1:11:41] <santafer> oh Asari High Command
[1:11:44] <dekkitout> When the sex is so good, it's a warcrime
[1:11:54] <Necnill> Welcome to Freak Planet
[1:11:54] <Gruhunchously> 'Stop wasting lives here?' Harsh, Liara
[1:11:57] <%Treasure_Vault> Nice one
[1:11:59] <%joebelieves> My favorite ginger, how ya doing?
[1:12:01] <mikeriffic> awww the special eyes are gone
[1:12:01] <cpt_langosta> still wearing death mask?
[1:12:01] <FlyguyJP> Literally asari succubus
[1:12:01] <terrible35> @allanmiri i remember the dudes in the bar with that convo in 1 or 2
[1:12:01] <santafer> death by Snu snu
[1:12:02] <PaperyHornet1013> is this a multiplayer  map?
[1:12:03] <%kyh9> Literally too strong
[1:12:03] <@QueequegTheater> I've read some good porn about this monastery Kappa
[1:12:04] <zhenthrim213> @allanmiri like mind-flayers?
[1:12:04] <FassieFons> blue alien vampires
[1:12:04] <mrblitzstream> Gotta fight VD with VD
[1:12:06] <SkinnyRite> The sex civil war has begun
[1:12:10] <allanmiri> @dekkitout So right, but so soooo wrong.
[1:12:14] <%dredgyboi> maybe we can fuck the reapers to death?

[1:25:43] <%dooscent> your biotic is for moving fast
[1:25:43] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt human biotics are inferior
[1:25:44] <@commanderclaw> Cause you could not play  Biotic
[1:25:47] <@QueequegTheater> Your biotics are shit

[1:25:58] <OldManDeckardCain> bioware: shut up that's why
[1:25:58] <Zombrocom> Because your biotics only exist in gameplay
[1:25:59] <Psyramics> cause 70% of players are soldiers with no biotics
[1:25:59] <Vekek_> Feather Fall is an asari biotic power, clearly.
[1:26:00] <mrblitzstream> swizards oif you will

[1:26:07] <DatAsuna> Kaidan is the only human that can reave as far as we know. lol
[1:26:07] <DSD24> They did all these cutscnes as if you were a SOldier
[1:26:08] <@Ranryu692> you chose "go fast" biotics, not "go slow" biotics
[1:26:09] <%Retinolgaming> Thats one thing that sucks looking back, everyone is soldier man in the cutscenes
[1:26:09] <zanzibarian_hamster> You have the UNGA ME HIT THINGS bionics, the IMPORTANT bionics

[1:30:41] <%DrTomT18> DONT LET IT NEAR YOU
[1:30:42] <allanmiri> At least you died by snu snu.
[1:30:42] <BurdRightsActivist> UNGA BUNGA
[1:30:42] <%X2Eliah> So uh Yeah, don't stay close to them
[1:30:43] <mikeriffic> So thats the death of most Multiplayer games back int he day
[1:30:44] <%maenos2> pat avoid melee range banshees ALWAYS
[1:30:45] <%AllenDeadman> command grabbed
[1:30:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Death by snu snu
[1:30:48] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Okay nvm maybe you shouldn't hit that
[1:30:51] <DSD24> The instant kills is gonna nappen
[1:30:52] <@commanderclaw> This is why you need guns other than a shotgun
[1:30:53] <%shadowsofpain> Damn you got Command grabbed dude
[1:30:54] <ChungusQuest> So with the way Asari work, is that grab kill literally rape?
[1:31:00] <%Afterman_> she volanic viper'd under his defense and opened his butthole up
[1:31:01] <mrblitzstream> banshee like: SUPRISE MF
[1:31:02] <allanmiri> IT TYME SNU SNU!
[1:31:03] <zhenthrim213> she has a good 720
[1:31:10] <FlyguyJP> @maenos2 Same with those Nemesis phantoms too
[1:31:13] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You need to social distance from the banshee
[1:31:18] <ChungusQuest> cause that's fucked up
[1:31:20] <Laecerelius> No Garrus.  Game get hard.
[1:31:20] <Mobilebeardunit> their one hit melee kill in Multiplayer was rouuugh
[1:31:20] <%jillyrancher> SCREEEEEEEEEE
[1:31:23] <Profmcstevie> Environmental awareness at a staggering 0 today
[1:31:23] <%xcompleasedad> He's LEARNING
[1:31:23] <Sp3ctre48> In the multiplayer the netcode being bad let Banshees grab you like that from a mile away sometimes, it was great
[1:31:28] <+Byr0nX> ...do you think Banshees got the gawk gawk
[1:31:31] <%Archmortal> no shame in turning the difficulty down if you need to
[1:31:31] <mrblitzstream> pat needs to sweep the banshees leg
[1:31:33] <%DrTomT18> pat you really need a pistol
[1:31:39] <%andrewofbob> I believe the rule with the command grab is if it walks about a bit while in a charged state, it's ready to grab until the charged state is cancelled
[1:31:43] <%DrTomT18> like seriously
[1:31:47] <%maenos2> don't charge a banshee
[1:31:50] <SaltyAzteca> THE BITCH IS DOWN
[1:31:54] <allanmiri> Pat's loosing health fast. What difficulty is he on? Or is ME3 harder than I remember?
[1:31:55] <Laecerelius> Paige would be proud of lady murder
[1:31:55] <mrblitzstream> One more down and its time for EASY MODE
[1:31:56] <$hattrick61> @chungusquest no the animation was bugged on the geometry. shes supposed to pick you up and impale you
[1:32:01] <%DrTomT18> preferably a hand Canon
[1:32:01] <williamrooster> might need a garrus
[1:32:01] <DSD24> Pistols are great in this game
[1:32:04] <%peachy996> Banshees man
[1:32:05] <+Byr0nX> or a rifle
[1:32:05] <GohansBeforeHohans> @Byr0nX atpCarl
[1:32:06] <%DrTomT18> or an auto
[1:32:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah, charge, shoot, back up, repeat, ez
[1:32:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> I played the multiplayer a lot. Even though it sucked, I liked the harpoon gun
[1:32:12] <%alphonseisbest> NAH JUST CHARGE MORE
[1:32:14] <Zombrocom> Man, why do all the other races get cool crazy super monster husks, and human husks are just dumb zombies
[1:32:15] <%andrewofbob> I'll headbutt banshees as long as they're in low power
[1:32:19] <DatAsuna> Banshees can't do the command grab on stairs either, so that's an easy way to just negate it
[1:32:23] <%peachy996> The Harpoon Gun is a good
[1:32:28] <terrible35> have faith in charge Pat
[1:32:28] <godila2> pat try talon pistol
[1:32:28] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat The Acolyte is perfect for destroying shields
[1:32:30] <ChungusQuest> @hattrick61 ah good, that's much less fucked up
[1:32:34] <%peachy996> It's not my type of gun but I can appreciate it
[1:32:35] <Sp3ctre48> Humans suck
[1:32:36] <%jillyrancher> it's very light too
[1:32:38] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> The guns in this game seem to be well made
[1:32:41] <+TheAdMerlin> It's weird how the reaperized human infantry are the only ones without any real weapons
[1:32:41] <MiamiMemory> Shepard's Angels
[1:32:44] <%X2Eliah> Human husks are the weakest of all husks
[1:32:47] <%DrTomT18> tali gives you a pretty nice pistol
[1:32:49] <Maids4lyfe> hell yeah womens' rights
[1:32:53] <Gruhunchously> Shepard likes to watch
[1:32:54] <%jillyrancher> Banshees are legit great enemies
[1:32:55] <Mobilebeardunit> Poor pat. Always using biotic charge. Nothin beats biotic charge. Good ol' biotic charge.
[1:32:56] <DatAsuna> I didn't like the harpoon gun until an MP challenge made me log time on it
[1:32:57] <mrblitzstream> LUL
[1:32:58] <DatAsuna> Now I love it
[1:33:09] <Blackleafx> Oh they were loking for survivors alright
[1:33:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> amazing how every good element of this game was WIPED OUT by how bad the ending was
[1:33:12] <@Spydurman> Commandos sneaking in for succubus time
[1:33:13] <allanmiri> "We gotta save the space pussy!"
[1:33:18] <%ahomeschooldropout> I think if you brought Javik he talks about nuking this place and genociding the Ardat-Yakshi
[1:33:20] <@commanderclaw> I love how the weapon upgrades are just strewn on the floor like someone dropped them bringing them back from the laundry.
[1:33:29] <zhenthrim213> hey plague
[1:33:30] <Blackleafx> BOMB
[1:33:33] <DSD24> Sticking the landing is very improtant
[1:33:35] <Maids4lyfe> space succubus, spacecubus
[1:33:36] <%DrTomT18> ENERGY DRAIN OP
[1:33:38] <mrblitzstream> gotta save that spussy
[1:33:39] <@Spydurman> @PlagueOfGripes this game is like an 8 or 9 out of 10 with a 2/10 ending it's bizzare
[1:33:40] <MiamiMemory> @PlagueOfGripes  Marauder Shields though..
[1:33:41] <FlyguyJP> Plague has come out of his Mancave
[1:33:42] <KnivesEve> is this the helmet with the special eyes?
[1:33:45] <%LumberjackJack> Combat drone is still great. Defense drone, however, is dogshit. Energy Drain is a better overload
[1:33:46] <+StromkoPenguin> I felt this game was pretty weak even before the ending, the writing and plot development was just worse.
[1:33:49] <@Ranryu692> let them use their abilities. no wonder you're dying so often
[1:33:50] <+condemned_15> blind
[1:33:51] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt explore for items before you go forward
[1:33:53] <Blackleafx> SHES BEEN TURNED
[1:33:57] <$hattrick61> My headcannon is that since they were making a full human reaper, they took the most stuff out of the humans, so thats why there husks are the worst
[1:33:58] <TheAntiNihilist> they were all going to the Space Orgy Party
[1:33:59] <scrumbotime> SHOOT NOW
[1:33:59] <DatAsuna> That other skill she has can also be decent CC
[1:33:59] <Blackleafx> Shoot now
[1:34:00] <Blackleafx> r1
[1:34:02] <%shadowsofpain> This game is excellent outside of side quests and that ending
[1:34:06] <DatAsuna> no damage, but still CC
[1:34:07] <%demiiluna> I think I saw a shiny on the right side when you came in
[1:34:09] <Zombrocom> MMMM
[1:34:10] <FassieFons> asari commandos are the kai leng of enemy factions
[1:34:13] <dekkitout> Uh oh, time to do an old yeller
[1:34:14] <mrblitzstream> damn plague has risen
[1:34:15] <Dragovus> SHE'S INFECTED WITH THE T-VIRUS!
[1:34:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> scour the planet for any stray toothpicks
[1:34:20] <+AmuserName> Bottom of stairs before ASARI
[1:34:20] <%demiiluna> As you're walking towards the bomb along the center path
[1:34:21] <%AllenDeadman> oh this part
[1:34:21] <%peachy996> I'm surprised Bioware has gone silent on the "maybe we'll put mp back in" it's as if they weren't expecting the response they got
[1:34:22] <%AllenDeadman> right
[1:34:27] <Sp3ctre48> Game kinda drops off a cliff after Tuchanka for me, some good moments here and there though
[1:34:28] <%maenos2> psaBlind
[1:34:28] <allanmiri> @PlagueOfGripes Pretty much yeah. There are parts fo this game that still hit me right were I live even though the ending makes me not want to play it ever again... almost.
[1:34:29] <+condemned_15> center stairs near corpse
[1:34:30] <thebalticguy1> middle floor
[1:34:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FassieFons you're... not wrong

[1:34:58] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 THe second they promised that I was like bullshit, no way edmonton is competant enough to reverse engineer it
[1:34:59] <Blackleafx> :)
[1:35:02] <+taggerung403> how come they dont look identical to samara like morinth did
[1:35:03] <%count_bob> Missed it three times.
[1:35:07] <MiamiMemory> Kai Leng is the type of guy that would be a discord admin

[1:35:12] <%peachy996> Yeah you're right
[1:35:13] <Blackleafx> butt
[1:35:16] <FlyguyJP> They patched up the ending with Extended Cut so it actually has an ending not just a hardcut
[1:35:17] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:35:17] <mrblitzstream> that ass tho
[1:35:18] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> LUL
[1:35:21] <%jillyrancher> Baby push
[1:35:24] <SaltyAzteca> SHE GOT THE REAPER COOTIES
[1:35:25] <+Goraka91> Okay but how
[1:35:27] <@Spydurman> death by shove
[1:35:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wasn't the original ending of the game supposed to be that the mass effect field was the cause of the reaper attacks, and it would need to be destroyed or made inaccessible?
[1:35:30] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Like a sack of potatos
[1:35:31] <%nertiaa> owo
[1:35:31] <Blackleafx> SHOOT HER NOW
[1:35:31] <DatAsuna> MP wasn't cut as a creative decision, it was cut because Bioware Edmonton is embarassed to admit that can't do it themselves
[1:35:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> Also "hey cut it out"
[1:35:33] <%shadowsofpain> Don't mind meld your sister, this isn't space pornhub
[1:35:38] <cpt_langosta> where's hans gruber when you need him?
[1:35:40] <%Daxalog> Ah well. Toss er out with the rest.
[1:35:42] <Gruhunchously> my b3n1s
[1:35:52] <Sp3ctre48> Liara throw that avenger away for the love of god
[1:35:52] <%Dakuu75> carefull: if you detonate it with yourr penius it might go off too soon
[1:35:53] <%jillyrancher> Sudden Eli
[1:36:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what shotgun is he using
[1:36:13] <%jillyrancher> REEEEEEEEE
[1:36:15] <%X2Eliah> yup
[1:36:16] <Blackleafx> Husk eat you, nom nom
[1:36:18] <%X2Eliah> they do that
[1:36:18] <%andrewofbob> Command grab #2
[1:36:18] <%peachy996> God I hate Banshees
[1:36:19] <allanmiri> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah the OG ending was that the Reapers were made to delay entropy basically and it was being sped up by the mass effect stuff.
[1:36:19] <scrumbotime> wow i didn't know that could happen
[1:36:20] <cpt_langosta> MAGIC PIXEL
[1:36:21] <%DrTomT18> @plagueofgripes it was basically that the use of Biotics were making the universe die faster (it's eluded too in Mass Effect 2)
[1:36:21] <%Garthunox> @PlagueOfGripes nope, mass effect fields were causing suns to go super nova super quickly, like 300 years after a sun was born
[1:36:22] <%RJay80> Husk command grabs
[1:36:22] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[1:36:23] <+Goraka91> Mass Effect technology was making Dark Matter go funny and accelerating the heat death of the universe, so the Reapers cull people when they got that technology yeah
[1:36:23] <Javier9563> yeah they do that in me3
[1:36:23] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> crunch
[1:36:23] <%peachy996> As a nonbiotic anyway
[1:36:24] <Dragovus> You love grapplers, Pat
[1:36:25] <%shadowsofpain> oh yeah they can do that
[1:36:26] <zhenthrim213> 2\
[1:36:26] <kingra> Dead spaced that bitch
[1:36:27] <FlyguyJP> Has Pat NEVER been grabbed by a husk?
[1:36:27] <SaltyAzteca> WOW
[1:36:28] <mrblitzstream> watch your six PAT
[1:36:31] <stantheman_97> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
[1:36:36] <Laecerelius> Shoulda had your pocket Garrus be here for the big murder time
[1:36:43] <DatAsuna> @PlagueOfGripes No, it was an idea they tossed around between games and decided against because it has contradictory plotholes in it. It didn't get as far as an original ending.
[1:36:46] <MidnightPacif1c> dont get command grabbed monkaS
[1:36:50] <%peachy996> Don't get grabbed
[1:36:51] <Blackleafx> SMASH
[1:36:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Was that animation literally recycled from dead space or nah?
[1:36:56] <Gruhunchously> Their doing the horror movies jitters
[1:36:59] <%shadowsofpain> Banshees are both Zoners and grapplers
[1:36:59] <godila2> somehow they fucked up shadows in this room i dont get it how NotLikeThis
[1:37:03] <El_GhostV1> this encounter fucked my shit on insanity
[1:37:05] <+Byr0nX> zoomin
[1:37:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> whatever it was, it sounds more reasonable than space baby
[1:37:08] <Blackleafx> F
[1:37:12] <shotgang86> chip damage
[1:37:13] <allanmiri> The OG ending was so much better and made sense and was built up in previous games in a subtle way then thrown out at the last possible second.
[1:37:14] <FlyguyJP> @Laecerelius Are you referring to Garrus ascending to Godhood?
[1:37:15] <%DrTomT18> ded
[1:37:15] <PaperyHornet1013> bussy
[1:37:16] <%SovPho> guess what this level is a pita

[1:38:12] <DatAsuna> @allanmiri It wasn't the OG ending. lol It was an idea they pitched and never seriously considered between games.
[1:38:12] <allanmiri> Hey Plague! What do you think of the Banshee?
[1:38:14] <OldManDeckardCain> TOTSUGEKI
[1:38:15] <+ipaintwithcolor> its the vanguard way, just keep doing it.
[1:38:16] <%DianaTheAscian> its working
[1:38:17] <FlyguyJP> They are gonna command grab you eventually
[1:38:19] <%shadowsofpain> Right the idea of an OG ending is wrong, it was an idea (that while way better) wasn't the official
[1:38:20] <%Mr___Pillow> lame it out!
[1:38:21] <@Spydurman> it looks like they're working LUL
[1:38:21] <PaperyHornet1013> GAMEPLAY

[1:38:27] <%Retinolgaming> LUL Totsugeki
[1:38:27] <+skylerpilot> yeah Biotic charge is BUSTED
[1:38:29] <@Spydurman> when in doubt lame it out
[1:38:30] <%peachy996> So you can but its dangerous to rely on
[1:38:31] <%jillyrancher> Plague pls draw a secy Banshee husk
[1:38:32] <Gruhunchously> Super cheese
[1:38:32] <%DrTomT18> @count_bob but what about Dragon Age Origins?

[1:38:41] <MiamiMemory> LOL Banshee git gud
[1:38:41] <%X2Eliah> @FlyguyJP Nah, he's on host, no off-sync grabs here
[1:38:44] <%Sweetangy021> Fighting like a dragonball z character is always optimal
[1:38:46] <tattleworm> sync kills don't work if you're standing on a sloped surface like stairs if you want to cheese them
[1:38:46] <%jillyrancher> TOTSUGEKI
[1:38:46] <scrumbotime> if only the alliance had more than one idiot who is a human cannonball, whole war would have been over in a fortnight
[1:38:48] <Laecerelius> Seemed to work quite well
[1:38:49] <Saltmeisterr> TOTSUGEKI
[1:38:49] <%Dakuu75> it's clearly NOT working~ Kappa
[1:38:50] <%faintsmile> it super worked

[1:38:58] <DatAsuna> @andrewofbob this yeah
[1:39:00] <Tracazoid> Pat's a May main now
[1:39:01] <+bear_breaker20> fucking may player here - Banshee
[1:39:02] <%shadowsofpain> only really works when there's one of them
[1:39:02] <%Meekest> Oh God it is totsugeki
[1:39:02] <Zombrocom> That did seem to work
[1:39:04] <FlyguyJP> Vanguard still busted
[1:39:05] <%DrTomT18> that's a very in effective way to do it but sure
[1:39:06] <Gruhunchously> Just headbutt them to death
[1:39:06] <+s0lesurviv0r> TOTSUGEKI
[1:39:08] <%andrewofbob> It'll work except for that one circumstance where it might not

[1:39:16] <%xcompleasedad> @shadowsofpain There were two
[1:39:17] <PaperyHornet1013> kiss her pat

[1:39:19] <DSD24> Get close again
[1:39:20] <@Ranryu692> @shadowsofpain he just did it to two of them
[1:39:21] <allanmiri> @PlagueOfGripes I had a feeling you'd be into them.
[1:39:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh right they haven't killed her yet
[1:39:22] <%count_bob> You kill the dragon and then...you leave. Same ending as KOTOR 1
[1:39:23] <%Mr___Pillow> way to trivialize a scary mini boss enemy  LUL
[1:39:24] <$hattrick61> more of a Stinger if you ask me
[1:39:25] <%Garthunox> didnt pat change the difficulty to normal?

[1:39:28] <%alphonseisbest> @shadowsofpain he just did it on tTWO in a row?!
[1:39:29] <Ardailec> Wouldn't work in Multiplayer due to BLITZ NETCODE
[1:39:29] <zhenthrim213> May is best mass effect class
[1:39:30] <%shadowsofpain> add a brute or another banshee and it all falls apart
[1:39:32] <tattleworm> any of those charges could've got you killed, you got lucky
[1:39:34] <%xcompleasedad> *yo
[1:39:38] <DatAsuna> @allanmiri They mention it in 1 story mission and 2 sidequests though. That doesn't mean it was gonna be a thing, both wlaters and karpyshyn have definitively said it was never the planned ending. lol
[1:39:38] <%xcompleasedad> *to
[1:39:38] <%alphonseisbest> @DrTomT18 cope
[1:39:41] <dekkitout> Give the reapers back their bomb

[1:39:45] <cpt_langosta> rila set us up the bomb
[1:39:47] <@commanderclaw> That's just one of the weapon upgrades!
[1:39:48] <%Dakuu75> Who ever just compared that move to Totsugeki... you just ruined ME for me.
[1:39:51] <FlyguyJP> I remember this scene and going "This is SUPER risky" like what she failed?
[1:39:52] <%bread_assassin> @Garthunox He ended up changing it back.
[1:39:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> take this, uh... lightsaber? giant fuse?
[1:39:55] <+vaderxyz1970> Doesnt even say by to her daughter

[1:40:32] <%Movemeister> In my mind this is always like that one Terminator scene with the breathing
[1:40:33] <%TheHateFish> @PatStaresAt That's a point, did you see that someone did an FF14 client side mod to add May's cry of TOTSUGEKI to the game whenever they used the BLU fish throw spell?
[1:40:34] <+D00msDayDan> oh my god plague
[1:40:36] <%Treuan> jesus

[1:41:03] <%SovPho> OH NO IT OKAY, DON'T BE CRY
[1:41:04] <allanmiri> Yeah, but it woulda been way less dramatic.
[1:41:04] <Vynith> everyone's a critic
[1:41:05] <%X2Eliah> @PlagueOfGripes you know why
[1:41:07] <mrblitzstream> @PlagueOfGripes why not

[1:41:17] <@commanderclaw> Shut up though
[1:41:17] <zhenthrim213> @PlagueOfGripes to change her into a banshee?
[1:41:19] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes Bioware playing lipservice to space lesbians
[1:41:19] <Sp3ctre48> It wouldn't have been dramatic
[1:41:22] <+vaderxyz1970> @plagueofgripes Trying to eat her mind?
[1:41:22] <deltamissfits> be ready pat
[1:41:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> Making out speeds up indoctrination
[1:41:24] <%AllenDeadman> yeah
[1:41:27] <tattleworm> it wouldn't have looked as cool
[1:41:28] <ChungusQuest> @PlagueOfGripes Ardat-Yakshi deal with a lot of sexual frustration

[1:42:33] <%MidnightBurst12> fuck the code

[1:42:35] <$hattrick61> as a wise man once said FUCK DA CODE
[1:42:37] <Blackleafx> ITS FULL OF BANSHEES
[1:42:39] <AngryAsian5> BUT THE CODE THOOO
[1:42:39] <commanderapathy> she is bound by the code
[1:42:39] <@Spydurman> the Normandy is now a monastery!
[1:42:40] <SaltyAzteca> ME AND MY HOMIES HATE THE CODE
[1:42:41] <falyden> anime reasoning
[1:42:41] <mrblitzstream> Fuck tha CODE
[1:42:42] <%peachy996> Can't though
[1:42:43] <PunchSlugfest> as someone who struggled with suicidal thoughts, this is the stupidest reason to take yourself out
[1:42:43] <DSD24> Shoot this motherfucker
[1:42:44] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Guessing renegade is super fucked up
[1:42:46] <FlyguyJP> That's not how the code works Pat
[1:42:47] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> code pat! CODE!
[1:42:49] <Sp3ctre48> That seems incredibly dumb, the Reapers literally invaded this place
[1:42:51] <%faintsmile> this is so dumb
[1:42:51] <cpt_langosta> what will she eat?
[1:42:52] <PaperyHornet1013> the code is more guidelines
[1:42:56] <Gruhunchously> I LUV YOU SAMARA BUT YOUR CODE IS BULLSHIT
[1:42:56] <%Deano8817> why does she sound like a completely different voice actor
[1:42:56] <shotgang86> this is stupid
[1:42:57] <%WhereIsWill> fuck the code is too good LUL
[1:42:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @kobi_robi_tobi yup

[1:43:05] <PunchSlugfest> what a flip flop bs
[1:43:07] <intestinal_bleeding> wow the code just can kinda do what it wants, huh?
[1:43:07] <%maenos2> awkward hug
[1:43:08] <MiamiMemory> Gief has got the drip
[1:43:08] <FlyguyJP> The Code is 100% or nothing. NO DEVIATIONS. EVER.
[1:43:09] <@Ranryu692> just wait until she leaves and don't tell her until it's all over
[1:43:12] <+vaderxyz1970> How does Pat know Shepard mouth is so wet
[1:43:13] <%shadowsofpain> This code can be easily bent
[1:43:14] <allanmiri> Who's mouth is wet? Shepard's or the dog's I wasn't paying attention.
[1:43:14] <%bread_assassin> Did Falare's voice change?
[1:43:18] <Maids4lyfe> @cpt_langosta she can eat anyone she wants
[1:43:21] <niffinbox> the code also says you owe me 2o bucks
[1:43:23] <+StromkoPenguin> I guess the Code says if you want to abdicate all responsibility then just off yourself. Weird.
[1:43:23] <quipquest1> It’s weird that the game frames this ad the right action.
[1:43:25] <Ekaelis> The Codex Astartes doesn't approve of this action.
[1:43:26] <commanderapathy> DO NOT DIVERT FROM THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
[1:43:27] <OldManDeckardCain> shepard: let my dick be your monastery
[1:43:29] <%Halospaz117> @PatStaresAt Fucked up thing is, you can let Samara shoot herself, THEN shoot her daughter just to be an asshole
[1:43:29] <GustauveVIII> its not
[1:43:30] <%X2Eliah> Not really
[1:43:33] <FlyguyJP> It isn't

[1:43:45] <%andrewofbob> Super dumb way to conclude this mission: let Samara commit suicide, then kill Falere, making the suicide pointless.
[1:43:45] <$SGrim> @Ekaelis Asari are obviously Tau
[1:43:46] <%maenos2> illusion of choice
[1:43:49] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> OH
[1:43:50] <%LumberjackJack> Oof
[1:43:50] <%peachy996> You can't recruit her. Another annoying thing about the squad in ME3
[1:43:51] <$hattrick61> what a hero
[1:43:53] <+Goraka91> ME3 Renegade is a piece of work
[1:43:54] <%Faustgesicht> So there's a fun little easter egg if you choose Morinth live in ME2
[1:43:54] <DatAsuna> Renegade shep is an ass
[1:43:55] <%dawarw0lf> If only

[1:44:26] <FlyguyJP> Morinth gets FUCKED in ME3
[1:44:27] <%miguelrod777> nope
[1:44:27] <%peachy996> Not that fun. I wish they did more with the Morinth thing
[1:44:28] <cpt_langosta> why was liara green?
[1:44:29] <$SGrim> @zhenthrim213 Protheans are eldar. Krogan are Orks
[1:44:35] <shotgang86> "why are you talking to your fingers shepard?"
[1:44:36] <%DrTomT18> renegade Shepard is board line retarded

[1:44:41] <%RJay80> That loser Kaden ?
[1:44:47] <PaperyHornet1013> worse than the salarians
[1:44:48] <Laecerelius> We set them up the bomb
[1:44:48] <FlyguyJP> Set us up the bomb
[1:44:50] <%Puhff> Why would you talk about that? Samara doesnt know Carth
[1:44:52] <Gruhunchously> There are a couple of times where a character is just 'welp, I have to sacrifice myself now' and then dies.
[1:45:01] <zhenthrim213> @SGrim i would call Protheans old ones
[1:45:06] <DSD24> New Cartha
[1:45:06] <Gruhunchously> Carth
[1:45:06] <available_line> @SGrim vorcha are orcs
[1:45:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> the council has yet to reach a consensus on how best to stand around with their dicks in their hands

[1:45:33] <%lloyddboy> darth side
[1:45:35] <@commanderclaw> He's boring and obnoxious is what he is
[1:45:39] <%MelBrooksKA> You are made of farts
[1:45:39] <allanmiri> I never did a pure renegade run cause I never wanted to play the games again, but I always imagined that with the Rachni dead, the lack of Krogens, soldiers, or whatever the fuck else would be really funny if Shepard showed up and they were like, "What help did you bring Shep?" and Shep would be like, "FUCKING NO ONE LOL!"
[1:45:39] <$SGrim> @zhenthrim213 Leviathans are the Old Ones. Reapers are Necrons.
[1:45:41] <intestinal_bleeding> it's the same VA fellers

[1:59:25] <PaperyHornet1013> how would you know kaiden
[1:59:26] <%peachy996> Kaiden has no meaningful conversation, only commentary
[1:59:29] <%Dakuu75> (Acting like your pet can understand english... I do that sometimes.)
[1:59:31] <allanmiri> Gief is rising up. he going through those rebellious teenage years.

[1:59:53] <%LumberjackJack> Shepard... you did fuck one
[1:59:57] <%Tarage> Gief is assuming direct control.
[2:00:01] <Gruhunchously> It's hilarious how much the writers didn't know what to do with the Virmire Survivor. Ashley gets it even worse.
[2:00:02] <%sandrews> Is Kaiden just horny this whole game?
[2:00:04] <%Rumbutt> I'm built differ-- URGHHH

[2:07:32] <%LumberjackJack> I say finish side quests, wrap up Citadel fetch stuff, then Omega (but yeah, Omega is kind of lengthy)
[2:07:32] <%unhuggable1> 2 hours
[2:07:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> Omega has a unique interrupt if you're an Engineer, but Omega's mostly just a shooting gallery tbh.
[2:07:34] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You will finish it next stream
[2:07:34] <DatAsuna> It's like 2-3 hours
[2:07:34] <godila2> 2-3 hours
[2:07:35] <%JamesCorck> If you wanna do everything.
[2:07:35] <%Dame_90> If you love Aria's blue ass the yeah
[2:07:36] <%Tarage> It's so long you can piss from the couch
[2:07:36] <%DianaTheAscian> longer
[2:07:39] <Mattais88> Has one of the best NPC's in the game
[2:07:40] <olaksi> not as thin though, like at least AA batter width
[2:07:41] <allanmiri> Girthy too.
[2:07:41] <%JamesCorck> Also once you're in you can't go back.
[2:07:44] <intestinal_bleeding> long like t hin spaghetti
[2:07:44] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt DLC are all their own arcs
[2:07:48] <joodatious> REMEMBER this is pats first time dont spoil shit
[2:07:50] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt there are sidequests on omega that are permanently missable if you don't do them
[2:07:51] <Ekaelis> Omega isn't what i'd describe as fun kind of long
[2:07:52] <%Tarage> What about your waifu
[2:07:53] <TheAntiNihilist> SPAGHETTI
[2:07:56] <%andrewofbob> Like, all of Tuchunka with side missions long
[2:07:57] <Gruhunchously> The only female turian in the galaxy
[2:07:58] <%X2Eliah> talk to aria on citadel.
[2:07:59] <%jtdobyns> Do citadel first then omega
[2:08:00] <KnightOfTrousers> Apparently in the Reaper's initial assault on Palavan the Turians baraged them directly as the Reaper's arrived, from behind, and destroyed a couple dozen Reapers
[2:08:00] <%X2Eliah> pat
[2:08:00] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Longer,Better and uncut
[2:08:01] <LightningLynx89> No spoils chat
[2:08:06] <%peachy996> I'm hoping Omega's janky animations during Aria's speech are still there
[2:08:14] <El_GhostV1> Omega can be a full stream
[2:08:16] <%unhuggable1> considering it has three hub intermissions id say its pretty long
[2:08:17] <+xerotwo> BWAAAAAAAAAAA

[2:09:34] <FlyguyJP> Is Chat mentally prepared?
[2:09:36] <DatAsuna> omega is like a while stream session on it's own
[2:09:40] <%LumberjackJack> You have to go to a station somewhere at Dock D24 to talk to Aria in a cutscene
[2:09:41] <Gruhunchously> She rides it so hard
[2:09:42] <joodatious> a little maybe
[2:09:42] <%ComfortableStranger> jacob cheats on femshep
[2:09:43] <$Futurecity10> Kind of

[2:12:03] <%AllenDeadman> YEAAAH
[2:12:05] <Dragovus> You should have brought Kaiden to meet Jacob, they could have had a Carth off
[2:12:08] <%AllenDeadman> aw he lived
[2:12:09] <mrblitzstream> booooo
[2:12:11] <%Tarage> Man why isn't he wearing ANY ARMOR
[2:12:11] <FlyguyJP> Ashley or Jacob. The ultimate choice
[2:12:13] <DatAsuna> president jacob
[2:12:14] <%Zalapski> chat racist af right now
[2:12:15] <jorniev> COVER ME HE SAID
[2:12:22] <BlackStarAura> Oh, the Jacob hate still burns, I see
[2:12:23] <%AllenDeadman> why didn't kill him?
[2:12:23] <%kekkerscrew> I actually liked Jacob in ME 2 but in this he's garbo
[2:12:25] <%Tarage> Jacob, you had armor. Did you lose it?
[2:12:26] <AlphaRayAllen> Patiently waiting for more hedgehogs
[2:12:26] <terrible35> No one survives a Carth off
[2:12:27] <%Halospaz117> Alright, now shoot everyone wearing Cerberus colors
[2:12:29] <%The_Death_Owl> chat said what?
[2:12:29] <%cooldude69xx> @Dragovus Nobody wins a carth off
[2:12:31] <%peachy996> he doesn't need armor he has ABS
[2:12:33] <joodatious> they really should of redesigned Jacob like they did Jack
[2:12:34] <%faintsmile> @Zalapski u mean bioware is racist af lol
[2:12:34] <%RealThiele> yes racism made jacob a shitty character
[2:12:35] <El_GhostV1> Do They die if you dont do the mission?
[2:12:39] <Sp3ctre48> I'm black I'm allowed to hate Jacob
[2:12:43] <%Garthunox> @Zalapski oh fuck off, jacob is a boring af character, go blow it out your ass
[2:12:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> They really should invest in armor that works in cutscenes, it would improve crew moretality
[2:12:49] <%Tarage> I bet he sold the armor to pay the child support.
[2:12:51] <available_line> Lots of show biomes in this game.
[2:12:54] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> That sound
[2:12:55] <%unhuggable1> what shotgun is that
[2:12:58] <%GohansBeforeHohans> I think Ashley is worse than Jacob
[2:13:01] <%Dame_90> I'm black and hate Jacob LUL
[2:13:03] <Gruhunchously> I have a feeling the writers really caved into fan pressure when it came to what characters to put in the spotlight
[2:13:03] <%X2Eliah> Disciple
[2:13:05] <%X2Eliah> it good
[2:13:07] <%shadowsofpain> Disciple is a good Shotgun
[2:13:10] <%peachy996> I hate Jacob as much as i hate Kaiden. It has nothing to do with race
[2:13:10] <%kekkerscrew> ME2 Jacob was interesting and had really fun missions
[2:13:14] <terrible35> flanked
[2:13:15] <%The_Death_Owl> let's agree that the writing and the chat is racist
[2:13:16] <%peachy996> They are boring
[2:13:24] <%shadowsofpain> I think it was my favorite shotgun in the MP
[2:13:24] <Profmcstevie> I like this shotgun, it sound good and fire good
[2:13:27] <joodatious> @kekkerscrew you forgot this /s
[2:13:28] <%AllenDeadman> sure does
[2:13:31] <olaksi> what on earth was interesting about jacob
[2:13:34] <%Tarage> Yeah I didn't say that due to race. He actually has child support...
[2:13:35] <%peachy996> I will not sir
[2:13:41] <atema128> Excuse you I am only racist toward Batarians
[2:13:43] <%shadowsofpain> a nice light shotgun
[2:13:45] <allanmiri> Stop! Stop he's arlready dead!
[2:13:45] <%LumberjackJack> Pat, you don't just shoot a guy in the dick!

[2:13:50] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Pat no
[2:13:53] <ChungusQuest> THE OOOOOOLD DICK TWIST
[2:13:54] <tattleworm> it's your inferno ammo explosions doing most of the damage, disciple ain't great without them
[2:13:55] <tanarath> The paladin was even better in 2
[2:13:55] <jorniev> FEELS LIKE A TIGRIS
[2:13:57] <dekkitout> Shoot one more time- maybe he's a secret krogan
[2:13:58] <%GohansBeforeHohans> @olaksi His loyalty mission thats about it
[2:13:58] <cpt_langosta> !wiener obliterated!
[2:14:00] <%Faustgesicht> Paladin headshot fucking own
[2:14:01] <%Archmortal> The Paladin is a ridiculously strong pistol in most scenarios
[2:14:09] <%Halospaz117> Always Respect Tali.... oh RESPEC
[2:14:09] <alrobot2014> the paladin is basically a better carnifex isn't it
[2:14:09] <%cooldude69xx> @atema128 As any upstanding member of council space should
[2:14:10] <Gruhunchously> Genocide is one thing, shooting a guy in the dick is crossing a line
[2:14:13] <%unhuggable1> discuple better than graal on insanity?
[2:14:16] <joodatious> imagine not seeing the past streams and seeing pat cheering when he sees a black guy get shot
[2:14:17] <+D00msDayDan> but does it have the duplex trigger?
[2:14:19] <Gruhunchously> Ciri???
[2:14:19] <%DianaTheAscian> OH YEAH
[2:14:24] <Mattais88> Whats a tigres?

[2:14:34] <%unhuggable1> i pretty much have onlt used the graal
[2:14:34] <%Halospaz117> You think if we wait long enough before talking to him, he'll bleed out?
[2:14:36] <%Faustgesicht> naw
[2:14:37] <PaperyHornet1013> The black squad mate is the only one that cheats

[2:15:53] <PaperyHornet1013> Nooooo
[2:15:53] <trianglehat> unfortunately yes
[2:15:53] <%Zebroneath> I guess it happens randomly
[2:15:54] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:15:54] <tanarath> IT’S BACK
[2:15:54] <+AmuserName> So it seems to be that if you START the mission with the helmet, you get special eyes?

[2:15:57] <alroy900> YEEAH
[2:15:58] <%Tarage> WHOS TALKING
[2:15:58] <%cooldude69xx> Oh no! Jacobs not gonna make it!
[2:15:59] <%peachy996> I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN IT
[2:16:00] <FlyguyJP> SPECIAL EYES
[2:16:02] <@QueequegTheater> Oh my god, the fact that it's now a coin flip per cutscene makes it even more exciting
[2:16:02] <allanmiri> They always gotta fix the fun bugs first.
[2:16:02] <%RealThiele> MY BRANDDD
[2:16:03] <%saiyanblitz> Those eyes
[2:16:03] <%Archmortal> KEEP THAT MASK ON
[2:16:03] <+pmtriox> boo jacob
[2:16:05] <Jaysky> catmechNyooom
[2:16:06] <Sp3ctre48> So yeah this is the lady Jacob cheats on you with if, for whatever reason, you decided to romance him in ME2
[2:16:07] <%shadowsofpain> it's not guaranteed
[2:16:07] <%Treasure_Vault> The others died but at least Jacob is alright
[2:16:07] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> It's still anime,good.
[2:16:08] <cpt_langosta> F
[2:16:08] <%peachy996> NO
[2:16:12] <DapperCadavr> I hate how every Mass Effect npc looks the exact fucking same
[2:16:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> They need to bring back Big Head mode features in games. The Big Eyes should be in all future ME games as a joke
[2:16:16] <%Tarage> NOOOOOOOOOO
[2:16:17] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT IS THIS
[2:16:18] <%DianaTheAscian> NOOOOOOO
[2:16:22] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> FUKIN JACOB
[2:16:23] <%Halospaz117> The special eyes are a mysterious beast
[2:16:23] <FassieFons> soft boos for jacob
[2:16:25] <%shadowsofpain> Oh good it fixed itself
[2:16:28] <alroy900> CURSES
[2:16:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> what are YOU doing here
[2:16:28] <DSD24> Glimpse of the Special Eyes
[2:16:28] <cpt_langosta> isn't that mrs. cuck?
[2:16:29] <%Halospaz117> They have a will of their own
[2:16:34] <shotgang86> so its just un combat scenarios
[2:16:34] <%peachy996> It's 50/50
[2:16:35] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> All good things leave us...
[2:16:35] <%faintsmile> @Sp3ctre48 there wasnt a single black person in the writer's room at bioware huh
[2:16:36] <tanarath> 'Supposed to', aka, falling
[2:16:39] <%trackles_64> booo
[2:16:40] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 What a bad look to put on the only black guy you get on your squad
[2:16:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Back to normal
[2:16:44] <%Tarage> Jacob could you BE more of a tool?
[2:16:47] <%JoshManVGH> I guess it only works when shepard has been in his helmet when the cutscene initiates
[2:16:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> "Who are you"
[2:16:49] <@QueequegTheater> Hey look it's that chick he knocked up when he cheated on FemShep
[2:16:53] <%X2Eliah> Man even in this mission Jacob is boring
[2:16:59] <topiodonk> its free
[2:17:00] <Gruhunchously> It's totally Ciri's voice
[2:17:00] <allanmiri> The special eyes are like batman sometimes you see them, sometimes you don't .
[2:17:01] <%Tarage> WHOS TALKING
[2:17:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> Has his voice actor changed?
[2:17:01] <%The_Death_Owl> that's what I'm saying. the writing around Jacob is chairSus
[2:17:05] <%bevyrage> ex-cerberus? cerberex?
[2:17:12] <OtakuSnake1> They couldn't find a GAP
[2:17:13] <%RealThiele> clothing is expensive
[2:17:14] <%bevyrage> WREX?
[2:17:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> These are the only clothes we own
[2:17:18] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Cost to much
[2:17:20] <DSD24> Isn't this Female Hawke's voice too?
[2:17:21] <%Halospaz117> @QueequegTheater Damn, Jacob cheats on FemShep with an entirely different Bioware protagonist
[2:17:24] <+pmtriox> ah good ol' doctor shiny lip
[2:17:27] <FlyguyJP> Jacob was always a meh character but Bioware sank any sympathy by how they handed the romance
[2:17:31] <Mattais88> So never finish you're job
[2:17:31] <%Dame_90> only brought one pair of clothing psaWhat
[2:17:32] <%Halospaz117> @DSD24 ya
[2:17:34] <%Tarage> Jacob why don't you literally have ANY armor?
[2:17:35] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, FemHawke as well
[2:17:35] <+pmtriox> @DSD24 yes
[2:17:35] <ketchuo13> @DSD24 Yeah, also ciri
[2:17:39] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat That's the homewrecker Jacob cheats on you with
[2:17:39] <cpt_langosta> how do you know he doesn't mess around? maybe he's a pro at messing around. he's illusive, after all.
[2:17:45] <@QueequegTheater> I like how the only black squad member cheats on you and knocks up some side chick
[2:17:46] <%cooldude69xx> I vote to keep the helmet on the grounds we get a new game: Special eyes, or no?
[2:17:54] <%bevyrage> just flip the clothes inside-out and become surebrec
[2:17:55] <%trackles_64> shout more jacob
[2:18:01] <joodatious> i dont think she knew either
[2:18:02] <DSD24> @Halospaz117 @pmtriox @ketchuo13 She has a nice voice
[2:18:03] <%Halospaz117> Yeah, she deserves better than Jacob
[2:18:03] <allanmiri> FemHawk was kinda cool. Shame I didn't like her game.
[2:18:04] <%Tarage> "She needs to finger my wound first"
[2:18:04] <ketchuo13> Better question is why would you bang Jacob
[2:18:04] <Latija> i ain't got time to bleed
[2:18:05] <FlyguyJP> Good boy
[2:18:11] <%peachy996> It has to be during action missions
[2:18:17] <Sp3ctre48> The ONLY black squadmate and he does that NotLikeThis
[2:18:19] <DSD24> Fem Hawke was cool
[2:18:23] <%The_Death_Owl> like they couldn't have run this by a black friend atleast or was Jacob written in secret as well?
[2:18:24] <%shadowsofpain> He can't cheat on your femShep if you have better taste in partners
[2:18:24] <+pmtriox> amazing dialogue
[2:18:28] <FlyguyJP> @ketchuo13 We all make bad choices
[2:18:29] <%RealThiele> Brynn deez nutz

[2:21:17] <%subparSamaritan> Probably the most monstrous person in the entire series
[2:21:17] <%LeiaSkynoober> DANCE ON HIS BODY
[2:21:17] <%cooldude69xx> @graniteflier Thats what his brother just saw for no apparent reason
[2:21:17] <El_GhostV1> Damn it be like tho
[2:21:18] <LightningLynx89> Suicide is bad ass!
[2:21:18] <@commanderclaw> Pat exists off of spite people
[2:21:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @knightoftrousers u can if u tell him his brother is safe
[2:21:19] <%Treuan> psaUp
[2:21:19] <%Halospaz117> True, we need to double tap
[2:21:19] <Aiutare47> prey slaughtered
[2:21:20] <AngryAsian5> There are better war assets LUL
[2:21:21] <Dunmarkh> like 5
[2:21:21] <%DrTomT18> there is no such thing as enough war assets
[2:21:21] <%Tarage> YOU NEED THAT 5 POINTS
[2:21:22] <KnightOfTrousers> I am SHOCKED you can't stop him from doing that
[2:21:23] <+dd44dostivei> he crucified his handicapped brother
[2:21:24] <PunchSlugfest> The war assets you get from that guy aren't worth the moral damage you take from rescuing that bastard
[2:21:25] <%trackles_64> you need 99% war asset to get good ending
[2:21:25] <Gruhunchously> I guess that's just the speed this game goes at
[2:21:26] <IvanMistwalker> reload
[2:21:28] <+MightyDuckShoes> why would he shoot himself for that?
[2:21:28] <mr_saturday93> How much DOES he even contribute anyway?
[2:21:31] <FlyguyJP> Real Talk: He was actually trying to make ammends
[2:21:32] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:21:32] <joodatious> it would make david happy if you let him live
[2:21:32] <PaperyHornet1013> 5 points
[2:21:33] <dekkitout> I doubt he's more of an asset than Verner
[2:21:34] <Sp3ctre48> I think we'll live without Dr "torture my autistic brother" Archer
[2:21:34] <%andrewofbob> Keeping him in the dark is arguably the correct choice morally
[2:21:34] <+senfood> Eh, he's probably worth like 20 points tops.
[2:21:34] <%Dame_90> Can waste a war asset there psaSmug
[2:21:34] <BlackStarAura> 25 fucking points
[2:21:36] <FassieFons> BUT THE BIG NUMBER COULD BE BIGGER
[2:21:36] <%shadowsofpain> Considering the MP isn't a thing maybe
[2:21:37] <%LeiaSkynoober> PAT BASED THO
[2:21:38] <goose_coward> unless he's into that
[2:21:39] <%Daxalog> "His autistic mind..." - That guy
[2:21:40] <tanarath> Pat will have enough, he's a literal nazi scientist
[2:21:40] <Dunmarkh> @mr_saturday93 25
[2:21:41] <+AmuserName> FUCK BIG NUMBER, ASSHOLE GET BIG KARMA
[2:21:42] <%LumberjackJack> You need a hundred-trillion to get the super-duper secret ending, and Archer gives you a super-secret multiplier to that total count
[2:21:42] <TheAntiNihilist> Ye
[2:21:42] <cpt_langosta> NO
[2:21:43] <mrblitzstream> LUL
[2:21:44] <%peachy996> Its right there isn't it
[2:21:44] <%faintsmile> noooooo
[2:21:45] <%DashXero> Wasn't that it over there?
[2:21:46] <KnightOfTrousers> @BallerSwagBro9k I meant afterward, like a paragon interrupt, you know?
[2:21:46] <%Tarage> Is it 5? I said 5 because I was joking.
[2:21:47] <DSD24> You can tell him @MightyDuckShoes He couldn't hack the guilt
[2:21:47] <%Halospaz117> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:21:48] <commanderapathy> a fitting end to a gigantic piece of shit

[2:22:04] <%subparSamaritan> BOOOOO
[2:22:05] <FlyguyJP> @PatStaresAt If you let the experiment continue, he actually kills his own brother rather than let the experiment continue after you leave
[2:22:05] <M0untain_wolf> Hearts of Hearts
[2:22:05] <%Mr___Pillow> they lowered the asset requirement from 4000 or something to around 3000
[2:22:06] <+xerotwo> doodBait

[2:22:25] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> He borged out his brother. Screw him.
[2:22:25] <%LeiaSkynoober> SHOOT HIM
[2:22:25] <%peachy996> Can't we have one hilariously dark choice in this playthrough you big para-girls?
[2:22:27] <%RealThiele> bullllllsheeeet
[2:22:29] <cpt_langosta> LET IT DIE
[2:22:30] <commanderapathy> double tap
[2:22:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> "I was going to kill myself. But now I will use this fertility injection to duplicate myself!" FUCK
[2:22:32] <joodatious> imagine if you just shot him yourself
[2:22:36] <%Treasure_Vault> If you tell him the geth and the quarian war is over, he realizes he did it all for nothing and kills himself anyway.
[2:22:38] <goose_coward> nobody cares  about elements dude
[2:22:39] <%LumberjackJack> SO YOU HOOKED UP YOUR BRO LIKE THAT?!
[2:22:39] <%Tarage> Man he kinda sounds like he has the autisms.
[2:22:41] <PunchSlugfest> I wish you can just empty a thermal clip in him
[2:22:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BUT YOU DID THO
[2:22:43] <Jaysky> Is this place just filled with awful people
[2:22:44] <%Halospaz117> BUT YOU DID THO
[2:22:46] <allanmiri> I don't even fully remember what he did, jus that it pissed me off at the time.
[2:22:48] <%subparSamaritan> YOUR nightmare
[2:22:51] <%Treuan> Yeah and I wanted to be a Transformer Archer
[2:22:51] <CopingFawn> It's up to David to forgive, not us.
[2:22:54] <mrblitzstream> yeah no, dont humanize him BIOWARE cowrds
[2:22:58] <%RealThiele> Element Ligma
[2:22:59] <+Baileymiab> he's really not that important of a war asset lmao let pat play the damn game how he wants
[2:23:03] <%subparSamaritan> Even Cerberus is like "nah, fuck this guy" lmao
[2:23:06] <%Garthunox> @CopingFawn blow it out your ass
[2:23:08] <%Halospaz117> Damn, maybe we judged cerberus too harshly
[2:23:09] <%Tarage> Okay Pat now reload and kill him again.
[2:23:11] <FassieFons> all these lines suck ass
[2:23:13] <cpt_langosta> forgiveness isn't the issue, it's justice
[2:23:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hand him over to TIM pleaaaaase
[2:23:15] <mikeriffic> Another autism
[2:23:22] <FlyguyJP> @PatStaresAt A great scene is where you let the experiment continue and he gets data on the geth but the you make friends with Geth so it was all for nothing.
[2:23:22] <+D00msDayDan> i should go
[2:23:23] <%RealThiele> HES AT IT AGAIN
[2:23:24] <mr_saturday93> th blower of autism!!!!!
[2:23:25] <%DrTomT18> see? he's trying
[2:23:25] <topiodonk> damn
[2:23:28] <%trackles_64> he pretends
[2:23:28] <+xerotwo> doodBait
[2:23:30] <mr_saturday93> power*
[2:23:31] <%peachy996> He dies if you don't save his brother
[2:23:32] <PaperyHornet1013> Autism
[2:23:34] <commanderapathy> @copingfawn now we don't have to forgive him
[2:23:37] <%Faustgesicht> self-loathing
[2:23:37] <Jaysky> The disdain
[2:23:37] <%saiyanblitz> Why are we letting this guy live again
[2:23:37] <Latija> he's already dead
[2:23:38] <DSD24> Disdain from Shepard
[2:23:40] <joodatious> exactlyy
[2:23:42] <cpt_langosta> but HE shouldn't live with this...
[2:23:43] <joodatious> its better this way
[2:23:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but suicide tho
[2:23:44] <%subparSamaritan> Should shoot him in his leg at least
[2:23:46] <ketchuo13> Yep
[2:23:47] <topiodonk> sheppard Hates him
[2:23:50] <joodatious> he can do more good at the least
[2:23:51] <commanderapathy> or worry about it
[2:23:52] <%AkronymCLT> Yeah there is no Shepard forgiveness here
[2:23:53] <%Dame_90> Live with his mistakes
[2:23:54] <stormhawk9891> Even on Paragon Shepherd fucking hates him
[2:23:55] <DSD24> Seriously that last line Shepard said was great
[2:23:57] <MiamiMemory> Letting him live out of spite
[2:23:58] <%Garthunox> @joodatious nah, fuck him
[2:23:58] <@commanderclaw> You should be able to slap his nuts, just a bit
[2:23:58] <%Halospaz117> Maybe just shoot his dick a little?
[2:23:59] <LightningLynx89> @saiyanblitz Hey man, those Nazi scientists built some cool rockets.
[2:24:03] <joodatious> oh shit it aas
[2:24:04] <%LeiaSkynoober> @CopingFawn As an autistic person, I'd shoot him on site
[2:24:05] <Jaysky> Him killing himself is too easy of away out
[2:24:05] <CopingFawn> @Garthunox Excellent counterpoint.
[2:24:05] <%Faustgesicht> Canonical hatred
[2:24:07] <Gruhunchously> Look, everyone in the galaxy is going to die anyway, why bother.
[2:24:07] <FassieFons> you can have disdain for him AND have him make your number bigger
[2:24:09] <allanmiri> @subparSamaritan He doesn't need that leg to work a computer console.
[2:24:11] <+pmtriox> somewhere
[2:24:15] <ketchuo13> Is it safe to say?
[2:24:15] <PaperyHornet1013> Reload kill him
[2:24:18] <FlyguyJP> He actually kills himself when you tell him you made allies of the geth and he killed his brother for nothing
[2:24:18] <+xerotwo> I don't remember this mission TBH LUL
[2:24:20] <joodatious> @joodatious YOURE DRUNK ON VENGENCE
[2:24:26] <mrtanaka111> NICE SPEECH
[2:24:26] <%Treasure_Vault> The best ending is telling him the quarian geth war is over, he never had to start overlord to begin with, and it was all for nothing.
[2:24:27] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Eh just buy it in the normandy shop
[2:24:27] <%Tarage> Does this lady have the same model as Traynor?
[2:24:30] <%Garthunox> @CopingFawn im basically a genius, ty
[2:24:31] <DSD24> Bryn is a nice name
[2:24:33] <%faintsmile> @FlyguyJP thats actually so funny omg
[2:24:36] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think anyone remembers this mission
[2:24:37] <BlackStarAura> The Turian poison cure is here
[2:24:39] <tattleworm> she just did a paragon interrupt
[2:24:41] <Gruhunchously> That guy isn't even driving the forklift there

[2:25:18] <mrblitzstream> Bryn you DUMB DUMB
[2:25:20] <terrible35> they'd be killed elsewhere
[2:25:21] <%Halospaz117> shit, that's a good line

[2:25:41] <Sp3ctre48> They had no choice obviously but it's still funny
[2:25:45] <%subparSamaritan> Jacob, you're useless
[2:25:47] <%Tarage> Man he's gonna be wincing the entire time.
[2:25:48] <AngryAsian5> Jacob got the stomach cramps

[2:26:00] <Ginganinja4545> I completely forget about Jacob
[2:26:00] <$hattrick61> technically it does
[2:26:01] <allanmiri> @Gruhunchously The importance of the (,)
[2:26:02] <%Halospaz117> Ok, mute the comms, got it

[2:26:06] <%trackles_64> why did you let him survive pat?
[2:26:09] <Zalpar> How many suicide missions has Shephard had?
[2:26:12] <+wizkid94> jacob totally needd to take a fst dump
[2:26:13] <Jaysky> Shitting and pissing on the radio
[2:26:14] <goose_coward> he's pooping blood out of his wound
[2:26:17] <%Tarage> See he's fine he isn't holding his side anymore.
[2:26:18] <Thepothero> SHIT ON THE FLOOR JACOB
[2:26:18] <OldManDeckardCain> weird flex, but ok
[2:26:19] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Isn't Vega such a massive improvement
[2:26:21] <AngryAsian5> Jacob's even useless in his own mission LUL
[2:26:24] <ChungusQuest> Isn't that a song by Slayer, "Shitting Blood"?
[2:26:31] <DSD24> Special Eyes?
[2:26:32] <%peachy996> It's hilarious how the ME2 squadmates that aren't Garrus or Tali come up with reasons not to be in your squad
[2:26:37] <%shadowsofpain> Hey Pat I know you like Tali, but would you consider stealing her from him?
[2:26:39] <Gruhunchously> Who could possibly fall in love with Jacob?
[2:26:44] <%peachy996> Some work some dont
[2:26:49] <PaperyHornet1013> Make HER cheat on Jacob
[2:26:50] <Jaysky> @queequegtheater Dont take much to improve on Jacob
[2:26:55] <DSD24> @peachy996 Kasumi's reasons is the worst
[2:26:58] <%alphonseisbest> James is everything Jacob wishes he was! FACTS
[2:27:00] <DatAsuna> This lady plays the Agent class in swtor.
[2:27:02] <tanarath> @gruhunchously Kasumi
[2:27:02] <CopingFawn> @LeiaSkynoober And as an aspie, I'm still not David. Don't misunderstand, David doesn't have an obligation to forgive, but it's his call to make.
[2:27:05] <Gruhunchously> Remeber when Cerberus only had 150 operatives?
[2:27:05] <%Halospaz117> @PaperyHornet1013 I like the way you think
[2:27:07] <DatAsuna> and hawke in Dragon age lol
[2:27:07] <joodatious> does jacob show up as an enemy if u dont do this i forget
[2:27:16] <Sp3ctre48> Sorry by 150 they meant 150000
[2:27:18] <%RealThiele> Illusive hammond
[2:27:19] <%Tarage> Technical perfection gave you your wicked cyber dong.
[2:27:21] <%peachy996> nah
[2:27:21] <%Treasure_Vault> Is it suppose to be mixed like this?
[2:27:34] <allanmiri> At least Jacob knows how to get a pretty lady. I'll give him that.
[2:27:38] <spuginky> what is going on outside?
[2:27:40] <Vekek_> EDI missed a few zeroes when she gave that 150 estimate.
[2:27:41] <joodatious> @Gruhunchously that was just the number they were open with
[2:27:44] <Gruhunchously> @DatAsuna And Ciri
[2:27:48] <DatAsuna> triple A games had garbage sound mixing until very recently
[2:27:49] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Its worth remembering 6 months pass between ME2 and 3 I believe. a lot of time to build up.
[2:27:50] <%Tarage> Let's have a casual talk while EXPLOSIONS
[2:27:56] <%subparSamaritan> It sounds like the fucking apocalypse outside
[2:28:00] <Latija> oh yeah just put reaper tech in your brain, good idea
[2:28:01] <LeiaSkynoober> @CopingFawn Oh for sure, but he can decide at Archer's grave lol
[2:28:01] <%DrTomT18> Pat, they kidnapped A LOT of people to turn into soldiers between Mass Effect 2 and 3
[2:28:04] <%peachy996> I have a theory. Every cutscene in  combat maps trigger the EYES.
[2:28:05] <jimmytwofeet> Maybe the in-game audio ducking is bugged, if it has any
[2:28:10] <%Archmortal> Mass Effect just has bad sound mixing in general, throughout the trilogy
[2:28:11] <%jillyrancher> Fuck Jacob's girlfriend
[2:28:14] <MiamiMemory> Cerebus is invading the roof as you speak
[2:28:15] <allanmiri> @Tarage Shepard's use to this by now I bet.
[2:28:20] <joodatious> most Cerberus agents were hidden, and others where indoctrinated
[2:28:22] <mrblitzstream> @Tarage Gotta know the DEEDS
[2:28:35] <%Tarage> Compress dez nutz
[2:28:36] <%Treasure_Vault> Oh OK, it sounds weird on purpose
[2:28:40] <goose_coward> moosha shaka baka
[2:28:41] <%chill_o_wisp> yeah ME3 is mixed very weird
[2:28:45] <%andrewofbob> I think this is just the game's mission being setup wrong for background noise
[2:28:47] <%slimmixrp> The game's internal mixing is turd
[2:28:50] <%Treasure_Vault> Stylistic choice to make it sound bad
[2:28:51] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:28:55] <thebalticguy1> OMEGA IS LONG
[2:28:56] <%Tarage> One more Pat
[2:28:56] <%peachy996> good choice
[2:28:57] <Latija> cerberus appears to have infinite manpower
[2:29:01] <%Tarage> GJ
[2:29:01] <%peachy996> Omega is loooong
[2:29:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Only Pat,himself is compressed Kappa
[2:29:11] <DatAsuna> Halo was the game that forced me into the habit of always turning music down to 70$ when I start games lol
[2:29:21] <+StromkoPenguin> I think that paper said Miranda was dead. *shrug*
[2:29:25] <DatAsuna> *70%, not $ lol
[2:29:28] <Gruhunchously> @joodatious Pretty sure that's the number you get when you bypass EDI's security protocols and access information you're not supposed to get.
[2:29:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna that's some expensive music
[2:29:39] <%DrTomT18> @Latija when you kidnap people and forcibly turn them into brainwashed cyborg soldiers, you can easily have infinite man power
[2:29:41] <FlyguyJP> Died
[2:29:47] <%peachy996> Use your inside voice Garrus
[2:29:50] <Dragovus> Beside the door on the floor, Pat
[2:29:56] <Latija> true
[2:29:56] <allanmiri> Cerberus would be way better if every one of their soldiers were just Illusive man clones that talked shit to you.
[2:29:56] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt item next to openable door
[2:29:58] <DatAsuna> @Latija spoilers
[2:30:07] <%Tarage> We bang ok
[2:30:16] <%faintsmile> this convo is SO cringe if ur a romanced femshep
[2:30:17] <goose_coward> what!
[2:30:17] <joodatious> omega is like 3 hours. its long if you think its a side quest
[2:30:18] <bearintonegaming> Don’t forget the item next to the door
[2:30:19] <PaperyHornet1013> make jacob cheat on his wife with you
[2:30:19] <%debugdrawray_> normal human sitting
[2:30:23] <%watts121> Jacob staring at that dick.
[2:30:27] <bearintonegaming> Looked like a mod part
[2:30:29] <mr_saturday93> They have a chance to talk pat
[2:30:30] <%peachy996> no muh people
[2:30:31] <%Tarage> You think he has time to remember every cracker he meets?
[2:30:33] <%DrTomT18> @Latija But. We've seen them doing it.
[2:30:35] <%peachy996> There it is
[2:30:38] <%Torus1025> He's supposed to be talking about how he came in that British chick
[2:30:39] <%DrTomT18> like, it's one of the first things
[2:30:48] <%peachy996> Everyone has a good case of the "I don't wanna's"
[2:30:51] <Sp3ctre48> That was weird LUL
[2:30:54] <%DrTomT18> Why do you hate Jacob so much?
[2:30:57] <%Tarage> Daddy why
[2:30:57] <+Baileymiab> Also turian poison in the lab
[2:31:00] <LightningLynx89> Jesus Pat's derision for Jacob is so fucking stupid.
[2:31:04] <%DrTomT18> He's just a normal dude.
[2:31:04] <%LumberjackJack> He's just boring.
[2:31:05] <mr_saturday93> Did last let Jacob kill his dad?
[2:31:06] <%Tarage> He's written badly
[2:31:09] <LightningLynx89> Yeah he's boring. Who fucking cares Pat
[2:31:11] <%peachy996> He is static
[2:31:13] <%lloyddboy> and his tits are diminuative
[2:31:14] <%Dakuu75> but, he has good one-liners
[2:31:15] <%Tarage> He's written as if Woolie wrote him.
[2:31:16] <@commanderclaw> Boring is the worst thing someone can be. If Ashley wasn't Racist, she'd be boring too
[2:31:16] <%DrTomT18> On a ship full of fucking weridos
[2:31:19] <%X2Eliah> Jacob has nothing of value going on
[2:31:19] <Sp3ctre48> @DrTomT18 He's boring and offends me personally
[2:31:21] <%watts121> Bioware completely hated Jacob too, cuz he gets less than everyone from ME2
[2:31:21] <Gruhunchously> He's probably the blandest character Bioware has ever made
[2:31:21] <joodatious> its about his horrible rapist dad
[2:31:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's a good kid. he sells insurance
[2:31:25] <%faintsmile> @LightningLynx89 lol why are u so pissy
[2:31:26] <%andrewofbob> @DrTomT18 Jacob is more boring than ME1 Ashley
[2:31:29] <%Tarage> Maximum racism
[2:31:31] <bearintonegaming> Look the issue with Jacob is that he’s boring and objectively stupid and irks pat something fierce
[2:31:31] <tanarath> he's bland & incredibly poorly written. he's also rong all throughout ME2
[2:31:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tarage DAYUM LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:38] <El_GhostV1> is Anderson the only good black character in mass effect?
[2:31:44] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Don't lady.
[2:31:47] <%watts121> HE HATES THE BLACKS
[2:31:47] <%Dakuu75> are fucking serious\
[2:31:49] <%DrTomT18> But I didn't. I was just asking.
[2:31:52] <BlackStarAura> If anyone’s racist, it’s the fucking writer’s room
[2:31:53] <%Tarage> Oof
[2:31:53] <goose_coward> SOME OF PAT'S BEST FRIENDS...
[2:31:54] <%slimmixrp> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:31:55] <LightningLynx89> Yeah that's fucked.
[2:31:58] <%Fooguwu> Also they put him in as a token black character and made his dad a deadbeat and him a cheater. Like fuck
[2:31:58] <Sp3ctre48> We could've had a cool black character NotLikeThis
[2:32:00] <%Dakuu75> what'd he JUST say CHAST
[2:32:01] <%Puhff> YIKES
[2:32:01] <+polothegreatest> sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude
[2:32:04] <joodatious> remember when pat wore blackface?
[2:32:04] <BlackStarAura> TOXIN DATA
[2:32:06] <+Extrallent> Lol they say it because they don't have an actual defense of the character
[2:32:06] <%X2Eliah> Just fucking ban some of these trolls
[2:32:07] <SiameseSneeze> All my homies hate Jacob
[2:32:07] <joodatious> that was crazy
[2:32:08] <quipquest1> Samantha trainer is black. She’s great
[2:32:09] <Jaysky> Garrus. Anything to say?
[2:32:09] <+Byr0nX> so biware is racist?
[2:32:09] <%RealThiele> big yikes
[2:32:09] <%MidnightBurst12> oof
[2:32:10] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @drtomt18 No the other guy
[2:32:10] <%watts121> Bioware made the only black male squadmate cheat on you.
[2:32:11] <%SirGO0SE> wow fucking deflecting much chat member?
[2:32:11] <intestinal_bleeding> that's te writers for you
[2:32:12] <shoobieredgrave> Pat we accepted your racism years ago its cool
[2:32:13] <%DianaTheAscian> fuck off 1 guy
[2:32:15] <@Lion_kun> Pat does a podcast with a black guy every week ffs
[2:32:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> Pat's not racist, he just hates Batarians
[2:32:16] <PaperyHornet1013> picked up woolies hatred
[2:32:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh wow geez
[2:32:16] <%LittleCinders> @patstaresat  So what are your thoughts on 3 so far?
[2:32:18] <topiodonk> Kaidan is pretty boring and Jacob is worst
[2:32:18] <%Tarage> He's not bad because he's a race, he's bad because he is written badly
[2:32:18] <%DrTomT18> oh alright.
[2:32:20] <allanmiri> Things... uh... things have gotten a little hot in here huh? woof.
[2:32:20] <+kewlmyc> As a black guy, yeah that's fucked.
[2:32:20] <@QueequegTheater> And you get to come back in an hour
[2:32:21] <%peachy996> I don't like implication where if you do not like a badly written character it's automatically because of their skin
[2:32:21] <+D00msDayDan> if anything bioware is racist for making the black guy so boring
[2:32:23] <Gruhunchously> @quipquest1 I think she's Indian
[2:32:24] <%Puhff> We all know Pat only hates the Lebanese Keepo
[2:32:26] <Goatllama> Blackface Bois in Da Chat
[2:32:29] <Thepothero> isnt javik is straight up raicist?
[2:32:30] <FlyguyJP> Calm down Woolie
[2:32:31] <%Dakuu75> psaBig bans
[2:32:33] <%DrTomT18> I love the Carnifex
[2:32:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Pat only hates Batarians
[2:32:34] <LightningLynx89> So Kai Lan
[2:32:36] <mr_saturday93> Considering your shep can be black I dont get it
[2:32:37] <LightningLynx89> *Lang
[2:32:40] <FlyguyJP> ME3 is very much like that
[2:32:42] <%DrTomT18> good Space revolver
[2:32:44] <%unhuggable1> Jacob is only a bad guy if ur femshep and romance him
[2:32:47] <%vivaldiva> psaBig quiettVaporscum
[2:32:48] <%toastybites> Jacob is also the only romance option that cheats on you
[2:32:49] <%kekkerscrew> Jacob is a good character that gets shat on by ME3's writing
[2:32:50] <%Tarage> Bioware is bad at writing anyone not generic cracker white
[2:32:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea kai leng is the best part of course Kappa
[2:32:51] <%andrewofbob> woolieONEGUY projecting their racism?
[2:32:53] <joodatious> @Thepothero yeah he's the most literal racist it gets
[2:32:55] <%watts121> squirt gun shotty
[2:33:00] <%faintsmile> jacob being boring is the least of the problems. all the racist tropes are a WAY bigger problem
[2:33:02] <commanderapathy> @thepothero I'd say more elitist
[2:33:04] <%peachy996> Jacob is boring but Liam in Andromeda is dumb to the point of idiocy
[2:33:06] <%LumberjackJack> Fire ammo turned off, again
[2:33:06] <Tracazoid> Now if only May could dolphin into shotgun
[2:33:06] <intestinal_bleeding> I remember this song though
[2:33:06] <mr_saturday93> Is kai Leng the ONLY manor asian character?
[2:33:07] <allanmiri> A good shotgun is your best friend in any game.
[2:33:09] <%DrTomT18> @unhuggable1 To be fair, you deserve it if you pick Jacob when Garrus is RIGHT THERE
[2:33:09] <intestinal_bleeding> it's a bop
[2:33:10] <%Faustgesicht> Yo Overlord Combat music
[2:33:11] <joodatious> jacob has no character
[2:33:16] <+AmuserName> They're using the Overlord theme for battle here!
[2:33:17] <Lamokmok> Disciple's pretty good for a light shotgun
[2:33:23] <%DrTomT18> @mr_saturday93 He's Asian?
[2:33:24] <%subparSamaritan> Project Overlord music?
[2:33:24] <LightningLynx89> @mr_saturday93 Kasumi Goto, lol
[2:33:27] <OldManDeckardCain> TOTSUGEKI
[2:33:30] <%peachy996> Overlord Battletheme
[2:33:32] <%andrewofbob> Pat's aborting turrets, now
[2:33:33] <Thepothero> cause i remember jaivk being kind of dick
[2:33:34] <Jaysky> @drtomt18 And Thane.
[2:33:44] <%Dakuu75> Pat Stream: "You mused be this BASED to ride."
[2:33:46] <mr_saturday93> @drtomt18 is he not?
[2:33:46] <%DrTomT18> Thane is good too. I love him.
[2:33:54] <Latija> to me it seems like jacob is the boring human romance option to go with miranda
[2:34:00] <FlyguyJP> Anyone see all those gaming *news* headlines about how ME4 could never work
[2:34:01] <%DrTomT18> @mr_saturday93 I have no idea!
[2:34:02] <joodatious> no there are other asian people
[2:34:04] <%jillyrancher> this is one of my least favorite missions tbh. I do not give a FUCK about Jacob's plight and his Cerberus refugees honestly
[2:34:05] <joodatious> like kasumi for one
[2:34:06] <mr_saturday93> @lightninglynx89 I forgot fuck...
[2:34:07] <terrible35> Javik is catagoricaly an asshole, but his whole life was war, so whatev
[2:34:07] <FlyguyJP> In today's enviroment
[2:34:08] <Latija> but at least miranda has a giant ass
[2:34:16] <Jaysky> At least Miranda is a bit of a bitch
[2:34:17] <%Tarage> Kasumi is good actually...
[2:34:21] <%jillyrancher> Miranda best girl
[2:34:28] <%Tarage> Kasumi is like a fun little sister.
[2:34:36] <Sp3ctre48> Javik is enjoyably horrible to me
[2:34:36] <FlyguyJP> Kasumi is a little too into her E-boyfriend
[2:34:41] <jorniev> i wish you could get fire support from the Normandy
[2:34:43] <Gruhunchously> Javik is an asshole, but crucially he's an asshole that's fun to listen to
[2:34:58] <allanmiri> @DrTomT18 He's great, but romancing him won't last cause of the illness, unless you really want to see how the drama plays out. Or you like the character so much you can deal with it.
[2:35:00] <joodatious> kasumi would turn her dead bf into a AI streamer
[2:35:01] <%Tarage> F
[2:35:04] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Shadow realm
[2:35:08] <SaltyAzteca> Im back. did the special eyes return?
[2:35:13] <$NoctisxMog> tbh it was racist to have Jacob's romance him cheating and have a baby with another woman
[2:35:14] <bearintonegaming> It resets the ammo every time you find a new gun. Even if you don’t open the weapon adjustment screen
[2:35:17] <%Tarage> They're doing the big good
[2:35:18] <mr_saturday93> Javik has every legitimate reason to be an asshole
[2:35:19] <%faintsmile> @Sp3ctre48 always weird to me that they gave him an African accent
[2:35:19] <%saiyanblitz> Did Shepard just vibrate through that air duct
[2:35:19] <%xcompleasedad> @joodatious fucking christ
[2:35:22] <Profmcstevie> Where wife, miss wife
[2:35:23] <Thepothero> loot rooPog
[2:35:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god the disciple fuckin rules
[2:35:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Overlord music?
[2:35:32] <FlyguyJP> The Thane romance is by far one of the most fleshed out
[2:35:37] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You're a one one wreacking crew
[2:35:48] <%peachy996> Bioware is hilariously insensitve with their writing sometimes.
[2:35:48] <Thepothero> @Profmcstevie wife fought back now miss wife
[2:35:53] <%DrTomT18> @DrTomT18 Well its not like Mass Effect 3 has a shortage of people throwing themselves at Shepard
[2:35:54] <BlackStarAura> Hey, what happens if you make Kasumi delete the greybox data in ME2? I never chose that
[2:35:54] <%Archmortal> 14 months, baby
[2:36:00] <joodatious> Liara is probably by far the best romance in the games
[2:36:02] <allanmiri> I've always referred to the Shotgun as old faithful in games.
[2:36:04] <+DracosMagala> What missions you did today?
[2:36:04] <+Kodkiro> you think they'll release a dragon age legendary edition
[2:36:06] <joodatious> it has a proper arc for it all
[2:36:06] <%DrTomT18> GLAD I COULD HELP YOU FIND IT, PAT! ahahahaha
[2:36:06] <terrible35> Charge Wife!
[2:36:06] <Gruhunchously> It is annoying how most of the major characters in the trilogy are human. Also annoying how the Elcor and Hanar have bascially no presence in the last two games
[2:36:08] <%Faustgesicht> Fuck yeah it is
[2:36:09] <%Tarage> Da gun
[2:36:11] <%Treasure_Vault> I just want to hear Woolie's reaction to Jacob
[2:36:19] <+Gamblor69> Sounds like R2's scream
[2:36:20] <%Tarage> You prolly coulda used that when there were enemies
[2:36:20] <+Sendrak70> Its a shame you cant make your dolls kiss each other. Would be fun to make the AI date each other.
[2:36:21] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, the Paladin is for Banshees and Turrets IMO, anything that hard counters Charge
[2:36:27] <allanmiri> Take care of your shotgun and it will take care of you.
[2:36:28] <%Archmortal> @BlackStarAura she doesn't stay obsessed and you don't get that ending scene
[2:36:31] <FlyguyJP> @BlackStarAura Not much visible changes. Different end slide and she isn't as hung up on her E-boyfriend in conversations
[2:36:39] <Jaysky> @joodatious Shes the intended romance option that's in every game in some capacity
[2:36:41] <goose_coward> let garrus have a go
[2:36:44] <BlackStarAura> Thanks
[2:36:44] <Profmcstevie> Garrus, calibrate this
[2:36:47] <Sp3ctre48> Liara is objectively the best romance because Bioware loves her and gives her way more content than the others
[2:36:51] <Gruhunchously> Isn't this where James just starts kicking it if you ask him to do it?
[2:36:51] <cpt_langosta> sausage time
[2:36:55] <%DrTomT18> theres a really funny mission where you can ask James to fix something, and it cuts to him at one point just kicking it
[2:36:58] <joodatious> @Gruhunchously thats just a general fantasy aspect. especially when the story is very much focused on how humans interact in the setting
[2:36:58] <SaltyAzteca> MORE DAKKA
[2:36:59] <%andrewofbob> Hanar's roles are 1: get indoctrinated, 2: freak out at Javik
[2:37:05] <mr_saturday93> Garrus is like another turret
[2:37:06] <%Tarage> Brap
[2:37:06] <MiamiMemory> Big gun go brrrrrrrr
[2:37:08] <Aiutare47> The one time gun calibration was crucial to the plot and you didnt choose Garrus for it
[2:37:09] <terrible35> Calibrate these goons Garrus
[2:37:10] <joodatious> the big thin in ME1 was being the first human spector
[2:37:12] <%DrTomT18> @Sp3ctre48 I fucking hate Liara and the writers obsession with her pisses me off
[2:37:13] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> meat grinder time
[2:37:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> @Treasure_Vault Why? He's just kind of boring
[2:37:16] <%kekkerscrew> can you shoot the shuttle?
[2:37:17] <LightningLynx89> Love how the enemies turn into red mist
[2:37:19] <AngryAsian5> GARRUS GO BRRRRRRT
[2:37:22] <SaltyAzteca> DISINTEGRATED
[2:37:22] <Dunmarkh> jesus christ
[2:37:24] <+Bigbossman91> @Gruhunchously nah that's another mission
[2:37:25] <%lloyddboy> CHUNKY SALSA
[2:37:25] <%kekkerscrew> You should be able to shoot the shuttle
[2:37:26] <MiamiMemory> GIBS
[2:37:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> Am I the only one that finds it kinda weird how the only black squadmate in the entire franchise has a estranged father and cheats on your femshep'
[2:37:28] <%RJay80> Turn to tomato paste
[2:37:30] <ThatDangSkeleton> these poor grunts don't stand a chance
[2:37:30] <El_GhostV1> Chunk
[2:37:31] <%Tarage> Don't worry about it.
[2:37:32] <%watts121> CHUNKY
[2:37:33] <%ToadKing> Gibs and everything
[2:37:33] <%LumberjackJack> You'd think a turret that big would at least damage the dropships
[2:37:33] <%DianaTheAscian> wow this thing fucks
[2:37:37] <%DrTomT18> Pat is this your first time using a turret?
[2:37:37] <olaksi> war is awes--- i mean hell
[2:37:38] <%chill_o_wisp> THE MAN MUNCHER 5000
[2:37:39] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> This game's meaty as hell
[2:37:41] <mak0t0yukii> Rated M for Mature
[2:37:42] <%peachy996> Look at the ships go nuts trying to drop ads
[2:37:42] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt shooting people with an anti-aircraft gun tends to rupture their bodies.
[2:37:46] <BlackStarAura> @thatdangskeleton NO
[2:37:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sosig machine
[2:37:48] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> But accurate
[2:37:50] <godila2> @Sp3ctre48 same here its so annoying
[2:37:50] <+chron0dude> Man bits
[2:37:51] <Profmcstevie> Eradicates humans, nothing to a ship
[2:37:51] <%faintsmile> @ahomeschooldropout not at all its super fucked up
[2:37:54] <BurdRightsActivist> -poof-
[2:37:56] <%Archmortal> @ahomeschooldropout no, it is very clear that Bioware was being super racist
[2:37:57] <%kekkerscrew> @ahomeschooldropout No it was commented on at the time it came out
[2:38:00] <Gruhunchously> @ahomeschooldropout To be fair, he's far from the only character with an estranged father
[2:38:02] <Javier9563> @Gruhunchously that's rannoch
[2:38:02] <tattleworm> i still think it's neat seeing them getting dropped in by your old shuttle
[2:38:03] <allanmiri> @Sp3ctre48 In terms of content you're not wrong, but it still says a lot that people still would rather go for Tali, Garrus and many others.
[2:38:04] <%lloyddboy> missed a shiny on the other side
[2:38:09] <%andrewofbob> And I though decapitating people with a shotgun was graphic...
[2:38:19] <tanarath> These are anti vehicle guns, Pat
[2:38:21] <%DrTomT18> @ahomeschooldropout I wish that Garrus' dad showed up in 3
[2:38:28] <%Rumbutt> TALI DOESN'T HAVE SPECIAL EYES
[2:38:28] <%Tarage> She did her best
[2:38:30] <%FaderPotater> she likes watching you work
[2:38:31] <%LumberjackJack> BioWare says "No, you do it"
[2:38:33] <%Treuan> Tali knows Shepard is the best at pushing it in
[2:38:34] <PaperyHornet1013> she knows you like pushing buttons
[2:38:34] <Lamokmok> Tali being dumb
[2:38:36] <%Rain_Mage> There were germs on that gun
[2:38:36] <AngryAsian5> You're the protagonist doe LUL
[2:38:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> ME2 should have the subtitle Daddy issues with how many charaters are defined by that, I mean holy hell
[2:38:39] <%hrbeck_> why would she ever do that?
[2:38:40] <%faintsmile> no but you need to push the thingy
[2:38:40] <allanmiri> She wasn't buff enough.
[2:38:43] <Profmcstevie> Reminds me of L4D2 when you have a LMG with explosive ammo, you leave behind next to nothing
[2:38:44] <%peachy996> Garrus Dad is in Andromeda
[2:38:44] <+AmuserName> @PatStaresAt She knows that as your man, you'll feel big and strong if you open the jars and activate the guns.
[2:38:46] <olaksi> @ahomeschooldropout yeah, rough parent relationships is kind of the closest thing ME2 comes to a theme
[2:38:46] <joodatious> @Sp3ctre48 well there are people who unironically love jacob so yeah
[2:38:47] <SaltyAzteca> @Rumbutt Neither does Shepat BibleThump
[2:38:50] <ThatDangSkeleton> turn em into Hamburger that tastes like human supremacism
[2:38:52] <+AmuserName> *her man
[2:38:57] <terrible35> Adam.... I mean Sheapard didnt say she could
[2:38:57] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt She needed you to push the thing in with your big strong man arms
[2:39:00] <Sp3ctre48> tbf I think that has to do with people liking Garrus and Tali more as characters to begin with, but I do think Liara gets way more to her romance
[2:39:13] <%Tarage> "Leave after the kids blow up and clog their guns"
[2:39:15] <allanmiri> @zanzibarian_hamster I sometimes wonder if they were going for some kind of theme that was going over my head.
[2:39:17] <Gruhunchously> @zanzibarian_hamster It's actually insane how many companion's stories have daddy issues at their core
[2:39:26] <Jaysky> ...
[2:39:26] <%RJay80> hmm
[2:39:29] <%faintsmile> if u missed loot
[2:39:30] <+AmuserName> "Do you want to loot the lab more?"
[2:39:31] <%watts121> it's if you missed intel
[2:39:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> Kill the Cerb peeps or save them
[2:39:32] <%Tarage> He wants to know if you wanna look for guns
[2:39:33] <Aiutare47> "are you ready to leave"
[2:39:34] <wolfen091> you get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
[2:39:34] <%RJay80> dont think so
[2:39:35] <%akscully> opportunity to check for items
[2:39:36] <%LumberjackJack> It just gives you one more chance to loot the place
[2:39:37] <stormhawk9891> Last chance to search for items
[2:39:38] <%Tarage> You already look for guns.
[2:39:39] <%DrTomT18> @Sp3ctre48 Mass Effect 3 beats you over the fucking head with 'ROMANCE LIARA'
[2:39:40] <+Sendrak70> not yet. Go and double check
[2:39:41] <mr_saturday93> if ya missed loot
[2:39:41] <%andrewofbob> Chance to hoover up upgrades
[2:39:42] <%DianaTheAscian> is there anything?
[2:39:42] <PaperyHornet1013> if you need to pick up turian poison
[2:39:42] <+Byr0nX> did you get everything
[2:39:42] <%Tarage> Is okay to leave
[2:39:43] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt anything you didn't pick up?
[2:39:43] <LightningLynx89> If you missed loot or sidequest stuff
[2:39:46] <%DrTomT18> No, you're good Pat
[2:39:48] <SaltyAzteca> I guess look around?
[2:39:49] <%TheHateFish> "There are missables in this zone"
[2:39:49] <joodatious> its mostly family issues and not daddy issues i'd say
[2:39:51] <%count_bob> loot the place.
[2:39:54] <%Tarage> He knows you love gun
[2:39:59] <godila2> @peachy996 wait what, didnt his dad was with garrus sister so stuck on palaven????
[2:40:02] <%unhuggable1> turian toxin is in the lab
[2:40:03] <%DrTomT18> Dragon Age Inq is just okay
[2:40:05] <Latija> inquisition is alright
[2:40:06] <joodatious> it was.. mostly kinda
[2:40:11] <terrible35> Me too
[2:40:12] <DatAsuna> DAI is just worse swtor
[2:40:14] <bearintonegaming> “Hey are you sure you got that Turian venom?”
[2:40:14] <%Tarage> Oh no all the kids died again!
[2:40:18] <brovietto> PULL
[2:40:18] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:40:19] <%sunsetdisc0> inquisition suuuuucked
[2:40:19] <@QueequegTheater> But what about that line you had a nervous breakdown over?
[2:40:20] <%watts121> Wish DAI wasn't this weird Solo-MMO game.
[2:40:20] <%faintsmile> its was very bland
[2:40:22] <%peachy996> @godila2 he didn't move to andromeda but he is there via recording
[2:40:23] <%DianaTheAscian> I've heard its just okay
[2:40:23] <%LumberjackJack> Star Wars reference
[2:40:25] <+AmuserName> It's an Empire Strikes Back! PogChamp
[2:40:25] <Profmcstevie> evaporated
[2:40:26] <allanmiri> I wish I liked Inquisition more too. I always get to Haven and I'm just like, I don't want to play anymore.
[2:40:26] <%DrTomT18> like, it's very middle of the road and has a lot of great writing but the game play just doesn't feel as good
[2:40:26] <%akscully> ok star wars
[2:40:27] <joodatious> Inquisition has some of the best dragon fights in video games
[2:40:28] <%Tarage> Remember Star Wars?
[2:40:30] <+Sendrak70> If you want a decent Dragon Age game, check out Greed Fall. Its similar enough and the story is good.
[2:40:30] <%CatRidder> some parts are good others are really bad
[2:40:30] <TheAntiNihilist> It was forgettable
[2:40:30] <%count_bob> it was pretty good.
[2:40:35] <%Treasure_Vault> Liara is the canon romance option. "I'm not sure if Shepherd was a man or a woman, but we fucked big."
[2:40:39] <%watts121> IMPERIAL TROOPS HAVE ENTERED THE BASE
[2:40:39] <godila2> @peachy996 ahhhh ok
[2:40:39] <BurdRightsActivist> OH NO THE HYPHENS
[2:40:40] <GustauveVIII> i wish inquisition felt like an action game instead of a mishmash of turn based and action
[2:40:40] <%Arkfyre> if only inquisition didnt have that line on your stream
[2:40:50] <+AmuserName> IMPERIAL TROOPS HAVE ENTERED THE BASE! IMPERIAL TROOPS HAVE ---
[2:40:50] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt How much Andromeda did you play?
[2:40:50] <%PocketBearIllustrator> at least in Inquisition, you can ride the Bull.
[2:40:51] <DatAsuna> I wish cassandra was as cool as I thought she would be
[2:40:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> @zanzibarian_hamster maybe the sine the reapers created the mass relays you could say they were the father of the intergalactic civilisation so we are rebelling against them or something, i dunno
[2:40:56] <%CatRidder> the ending was also bad
[2:40:58] <Latija> @Arkfyre HOLD ON
[2:40:59] <Goatllama> oooooh noooooo nooooot ceeeeeerberus
[2:41:03] <DatAsuna> don't open the wampa door
[2:41:11] <%hrbeck_> oh no! It's all of our fathers melded into one super father!!
[2:41:15] <Goatllama> POOCHYYYYYYYY
[2:41:18] <terrible35> its ok the shuttle was full of starkids
[2:41:21] <%Tarage> Gief made his point.
[2:41:21] <%DrTomT18> glad you like the shotgun so much, Pat.
[2:41:24] <FlyguyJP> @Treasure_Vault Liara is also the only romance choice that has never had a chance to die
[2:41:26] <%peachy996> I remember this battle theme from MP
[2:41:38] <MiamiMemory> Floating henchman
[2:41:39] <%DrTomT18> At least the Asari are good for something harharhar
[2:41:42] <mr_saturday93> that man was magic
[2:41:46] <anAngryHamster> Greed fall plays like shit though
[2:41:52] <MiamiMemory> This shotgun FUCKS
[2:41:55] <DatAsuna> It's a very fun light shotty
[2:41:58] <%RJay80> dont sorry i that guy still had his jet boots oj :)
[2:41:58] <allanmiri> @zanzibarian_hamster @zanzibarian_hamster your guess on the daddy issue stuff is as good as mine.
[2:42:04] <+DBTenno> Ah the classic ME3 Vanguard "RAAA RAARRGH" combo
[2:42:07] <tattleworm> if you like this, you'll love the piranha
[2:42:10] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Why's it sound like zangeif borking
[2:42:10] <DatAsuna> I used this a lot in MP
[2:42:18] <%Tarage> Bwom
[2:42:21] <FlyguyJP> Because they know you do all the work.
[2:42:26] <Goatllama> is there gonna be a dragon on this bridge
[2:42:31] <Gruhunchously> Why does Cerberus have infinite recourses?
[2:42:40] <joodatious> Greedfall is made by people who love bioware games but are equally bad at writting bioware games as modern bioware
[2:42:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> why is cereberus the enemy again? I cannot remember
[2:42:46] <%peachy996> Almost Everyone in the whole trilogy has family issues
[2:42:47] <tattleworm> because tim is bezos rich
[2:42:50] <+DBTenno> Yeah it's been years since I saw that. ME3 MP was nonstop Vanguard charge + melee slam
[2:42:50] <%DrTomT18> @Gruhunchously Spoilers
[2:42:52] <+MightyDuckShoes> I won't forgive Inquisition for not having the black Malificent looking chick be a romance option. Not ever WutFace
[2:42:52] <AngryAsian5> The ninja harem LUL
[2:42:53] <BurdRightsActivist> Beasts all over the shop
[2:42:55] <stantheman_97> LUL
[2:42:55] <%shurtal> the girlfriend is ded
[2:42:57] <terrible35> @Gruhunchously forceful conversion of civillians into troops?
[2:42:57] <SaltyAzteca> GEEZ
[2:42:58] <MiamiMemory> Don't bully ninja
[2:42:58] <%Dame_90> That's why he's mad
[2:42:58] <%Archmortal> @anAngryHamster I'd say it plays better than DA Origins, but I prefer direct control over auto-attacking
[2:42:59] <LightningLynx89> Just a Killzone
[2:43:00] <%Tarage> Increase difficulty then
[2:43:01] <+TheAdMerlin> ME3 really feels like it wants you using an Assault Rifle sometimes
[2:43:03] <%RJay80> spawn camping yeah
[2:43:04] <%peachy996> Bacause stupid writing plague
[2:43:05] <Jaysky> Who Lang?
[2:43:06] <SaltyAzteca> THE GUN DISCIPLINES
[2:43:06] <%shurtal> Fuck Fairness
[2:43:06] <%hrbeck_> dropship encounters often suck
[2:43:08] <Latija> @PlagueOfGripes they got brain washed by the reapers i guess
[2:43:09] <Sp3ctre48> Cerberus wants to control the Reapers because reasons
[2:43:10] <%xcompleasedad> @PlagueOfGripes SpoilerISH: Indoctrination
[2:43:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so satisfying to just kill them as the fall
[2:43:10] <%watts121> Cerberus really sucks at dropships
[2:43:12] <Profmcstevie> Then tell them to stop dropping in in front of your gun LUL
[2:43:15] <godila2> this will be fine for omega pat dont worry
[2:43:18] <%peachy996> You need to fight Humans don't you know?
[2:43:18] <%andrewofbob> The difficulty is Insanity minus 1?
[2:43:19] <mr_saturday93> @plagueofgripes minor spoilers but mostly indoctrination
[2:43:20] <%subparSamaritan> Oh no, not an Atlas mech
[2:43:20] <El_GhostV1> Toxic spawn camping
[2:43:20] <Mattais88> f they didn't want to die they wouldn't line up single file and enter one at a time
[2:43:22] <%Tarage> Garrus kill man
[2:43:25] <%count_bob> origins was not good
[2:43:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh right, fucking Lang. I forgot that little twink cuck exists for us to slaughter
[2:43:30] <%faintsmile> @joodatious are people reccing greedfall?? that game had an incest romance for the player that was scrapped at the last second lol
[2:43:30] <dekkitout> Garry! Do something!
[2:43:30] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:43:32] <%DrTomT18> @watts121 It would be cool if you could blow up the drop ships like you could in Halo
[2:43:32] <%watts121> Like the smart thing would have been to drop the mech first, then the troops.
[2:43:35] <goose_coward> damn

[2:43:59] <ketchuo13> Oh nvm, I see Garrus has transcended to godhood
[2:44:00] <%Daxalog> God. Mechs really are just only used to end a mission
[2:44:00] <%subparSamaritan> As it should be
[2:44:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> give me a sec. just realized rocket booting in for about 15 seconds of landing. I hope noone shotties me....
[2:44:01] <%peachy996> Garrus is a chad

[2:46:01] <olaksi> but it looks cool!
[2:46:01] <%DrTomT18> The only person now joining you that doesn't make sense Zaeed. Probably because his Voice Actor was busy.
[2:46:01] <FlyguyJP> It was to give them something to do
[2:46:07] <joodatious> ACTION!
[2:46:07] <%Tarage> Pat stop using logic
[2:46:08] <+DBTenno> They have an army, but Shepard has FAMILY
[2:46:09] <Jaysky> DRAMA
[2:46:09] <%LumberjackJack> To get a better shot? I dunno
[2:46:11] <joodatious> ADVENTURE
[2:46:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> but now not 10 man
[2:46:13] <tattleworm> he made the mech trip a little bit
[2:46:19] <terrible35> prevents them from setting up a good shot i guess
[2:46:21] <T_Sasquatch> Me2 has the problem of every character can die so in me3 they have to make bullshit excuses for why they can't stay with you
[2:46:24] <%VictorVonLouche> Better to just lob a grenade behind you and gtfo
[2:46:24] <MiamiMemory> Who are you again?
[2:46:25] <allanmiri> But-but didn't you think Jacob was cool though!?
[2:46:25] <%DJFakie> Kai Lang will make sure there's never another Windjammers
[2:46:26] <joodatious> its hollywood bullshit pat
[2:46:28] <%RealThiele> the hope is that five of their friends dying is a deterrent is doesnt work well here
[2:46:32] <%LumberjackJack> Didn't he say that last time, too?
[2:46:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> is she hitting on you

[2:46:55] <PaperyHornet1013> dont they might be indoctrinated
[2:46:55] <Sp3ctre48> why though
[2:46:56] <%Tarage> "Why are you sending me Jacob I hate him Shepard"
[2:46:56] <%kekkerscrew> Remember if you don't do Jack's mission early enough she actually ends up as one of Kai Leng's girlfriends and you kill her on the mission that Kai Leng assaults the Citadel.
[2:46:57] <%jillyrancher> I would not drink with you Jacob.
[2:46:58] <KnivesEve> didnt jacob cheat on femshep?

[2:47:20] <%akscully> even this mission isn't about jacob, it's about dr cole
[2:47:21] <%watts121> yes Jacob canonically cheats on Shepard with that random doctor.
