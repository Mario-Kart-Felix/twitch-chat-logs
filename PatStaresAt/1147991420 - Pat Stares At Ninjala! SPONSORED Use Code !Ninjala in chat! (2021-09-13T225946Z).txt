[0:46:25] <%blaggablag> @Dave_VD I mean, I'm not complaining, I really love the Splatoon aesthetic! It's just it makes this game look like an off brand copy put next to it.

[0:46:31] <%andrewofbob> "Lucy" and not "PeachMelon111"

[0:48:11] <%RealThiele> use cold water to clean gum from your hair
[0:48:12] <%logoth_> maybe they're robot children
[0:48:12] <%LeiaSkynoober> Those are totally bots
[0:48:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can tell they're bots cuz their names are super normal
[0:48:14] <%hrbeck_> beat those computer kids
[0:48:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> the ones in the back CRY

[0:48:20] <+ThorgrimFunhammer> the baby robots
[0:48:23] <%MechArch> based
[0:48:24] <%arkv01> phew thankfully these were bots, no charges of cyber bullying will be made :)
[0:48:28] <%Ne1son> Based on What
[0:48:29] <%vexion_smh> what if real kids but names are randomized by the game
[0:48:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Honestly bots are as good or better than children
[0:48:31] <%LeiaSkynoober> I didn't understand anything my first few runs and then quit
[0:48:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> You beat up baby bits
[0:48:33] <%tempestzephyr> We're all bots, pat, always were
[0:48:33] <KingSpunf> PSYCHO STreamer HUMILIATES CHILDREN on-stream!
[0:48:33] <DensityD> there should be no celebrating for 2nd and 3rd place, if you're not first, you're last
[0:48:36] <%BinaryFireball> they might only diplay character names for moderation reasons
[0:48:37] <maybefalco> child robots, can't even do cool tech
[0:48:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> children are not good at vibeo gange
[0:48:46] <+ThatGuyThunder> !ninjala
[0:48:46] <@Moobot> @ThatGuyThunder Hey check out Ninjala! It's cool and FREE! https://i.try.games/ninjala/ip8uzh

[0:49:06] <%YakumoYomi> Yes, Pat. You are safe from the killers
[0:49:06] <+twohitgood> makin' kids cry brah
[0:49:06] <%redthebaron> kids should always be forced to ´play with killers online
[0:49:08] <ChloeFleurage> safe says pat until he gets mauled by a group of 8 year olds online
[0:49:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it also means you dont get blown up by someone whose been playing since august last year lmao
[0:49:09] <%DashXero> We want to see you destroy child egos.
[0:49:13] <+ThatGuyThunder> I’ll find you Pat! We shall kick ass
[0:49:13] <%hrbeck_> yes, the children are safe from Pat who would do great harm to them
[0:49:15] <%blaggablag> Murdering artificial children might not be the same but it should suffice for now
[0:49:16] <%Bailey__gaming> what is this oN?
[0:49:21] <Madinki> Don't play with NATRUAL BORN KILLAS
[0:49:24] <BigFingerRo> HEY'SPASTARATSTREEAMNHOWSERRBODDOEEEEEN?

[0:49:27] <DensityD> watch out Pat is a real ki-HAHAHAHAHAHA couldn't finish it
[0:49:31] <lilmac64> This is on the switch, right?
[0:49:34] <%tusk102> @Bailey__gaming switch
[0:49:35] <@Moobot> Hey check out Ninjala! It's cool and FREE! https://i.try.games/ninjala/ip8uzh
[0:49:36] <allanmiri> I want Pat to get in a real match and get beaten down by by a child with their mic on and they have the highest squeekiest voice possible.
[0:49:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is like unleashing a rank 1 killer on rank 20 survivors
[0:49:38] <BigFingerRo> Oh, Pat is killing children?
[0:49:39] <tanarath> @bailey__gaming just the switch
[0:49:39] <%DashXero> Break them. Break them like life has broken us. Be Life, Pat.
[0:49:41] <%bevyrage> switch @Bailey__gaming
[0:49:43] <DensityD> you ain't nothin but a hound dog
[0:49:43] <%greasypete00> knick knack paddy whack give a dog a bone?
[0:49:45] <+V3RTIGO_222> I both want to see Pat destroy children but also see him destroyed by children
[0:49:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt knick knack patty wack give a dog a bone
[0:49:51] <JayPastaForce> Ninjala: Become Human

[0:50:23] <%cooldude69xx> @V3RTIGO_222 Its a win-win for chat today!
[0:50:25] <%strakillias> Is that what Pat looked like as a kid? Did he use up all his hair power having little kid anime hair?
[0:50:27] <%hrbeck_> Pat got tutorial'd by the bot
[0:50:34] <allanmiri> Naruto run to victory.
[0:50:46] <JayPastaForce> You can cancel most normals into dash
[0:50:50] <BigFingerRo> This art style is getting a TON of play on the Switch, isn't it?
[0:50:52] <%YakumoYomi> I think you get bots until you hit level 5
[0:50:59] <$Jetfandam> naruto run the game
[0:50:59] <MayorRev> Usually it takes 2 or 3 gum shoots to bind an opponent but you can definitely zone people
[0:51:02] <Dave_VD> @andrewofbob artificial life is inherently lesser and must accept it’s/their place as our slaves
[0:51:02] <DensityD> Nabbit cheerleaders?
[0:51:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This old man, he played one, he played knick knack on my thumb, with a knick knack paddy wack, give a dog a bone,  this old man came rolling home

[0:51:10] <%Puhff> RON YOU FOOL

[0:52:13] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt that was the hammer supr
[0:52:14] <+Fefe41> This game's aesthetics somehow reminds me of Ape Escape, and now I feel old
[0:52:17] <DensityD> the stolen Ippon
[0:52:17] <%RealThiele> jake froma bove
[0:52:19] <%Qsmash_> \

[0:52:53] <%blaggablag> ya got ippon'd
[0:52:55] <TheHappyCynic> just got here how's the game?
[0:53:04] <MayorRev> that pic of the sword when you won a parry means you had a big weapon advantage. happens when you both pick the same attack direction
[0:53:12] <MayorRev> KIWAMI
[0:53:14] <BigFingerRo> @TheHappyCynic pat is killing children again
[0:53:18] <%tusk102> is there a way to regain health?
[0:53:20] <DensityD> gomu gomu storm
[0:53:22] <%Daxalog> God your character just screams his little heart out. Hes so excited just to be there
[0:53:27] <cheapdoc> I can't believe that Ninjala is cheating on Woolie with Pat
[0:53:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> This looks like it has better netcode than Samsho
[0:53:27] <%tusk102> oh it regens
[0:53:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 1st place again
[0:53:44] <DensityD> do you see that big hammer?
[0:53:46] <allanmiri> So how long until Pat default dances on their ass?
[0:53:48] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt parries create bubbles to prevent third parties
[0:53:48] <%lumporr> why gum?
[0:53:59] <%cooldude69xx> @GalacticaPhanto I grew a potato with better netcode than Samsho
[0:54:01] <livehardman> you beat the bots
[0:54:03] <BigFingerRo> PASTA RAT WINS IT
[0:54:04] <%hrbeck_> kids
[0:54:05] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:54:08] <DensityD> chance time LUL
[0:54:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Children, much like robots and other non-humans cant swim
[0:54:16] <scrumbotime> BEAT CHILDREN, YEAH!
[0:54:17] <%hrbeck_> Pat wins a gain
[0:54:19] <@Ranryu692> @MayorRev that's a cool mechanic
[0:54:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> @lumporr children like the bubblegum right?
[0:54:20] <%tusk102> pats a genetic freak, and he's NOT normal
[0:54:25] <DensityD> in water, chimps will drown
[0:54:31] <%bevyrage> can fish swim, or do they merely fly through the water?
[0:54:31] <%hrbeck_> this is his ninjala way
[0:54:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reject Netcode, Embrace BLITZ NETCODE
[0:54:38] <cheapdoc> And then you step on those children, yeah
[0:54:39] <BigFingerRo> @tusk102 BIG POPPA PUMP LUL
[0:54:43] <%arkv01> patrick, hero of the children
[0:54:46] <AoiRob> curbstomp those infants into the pavement

[0:54:49] <leinadtonu> oh boy
[0:54:51] <%AncelDeLambert> these children are HORRIFYING
[0:54:52] <@Ranryu692> you need to step up to look the children in the eye
[0:54:52] <%RealThiele> step up on the bodies of dead kids
[0:54:54] <%tempestzephyr> yeah, step on the children
[0:54:56] <@ssjklyco> Punching children is PG 13
[0:54:57] <thesugardaddy111> nah pat just beats kids irl confirmed
[0:54:58] <%baka_sugoi> Stepping up unlike the fatherless children you bully
[0:55:01] <%SWFanatic> Take a dump on the babies
[0:55:07] <%arkv01> @Ranryu692 D: D: D: D:
[0:55:12] <joodatious> hey guys i couldnt find an awnser what happened to the podcast?
[0:55:12] <+MoeScams> what fresh hell is this
[0:55:13] <%Deft_Thought> cmonBruh the hell kinda dance was that
[0:55:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Beating up children is G rated, all audiences
[0:55:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "I don't know how to communicate, but that's okay" -Evangelion
[0:55:22] <AoiRob> put a mask so we dont have to see their horrible face

[0:55:27] <@Moobot> @JORDANdotEXE Hey check out Ninjala! It's cool and FREE! https://i.try.games/ninjala/ip8uzh
[0:55:35] <%linSP> one reason why I like pats stream is the child pummeling

[0:55:39] <%RealThiele> his proportions are jank
[0:55:40] <%arkv01> @joodatious woolie's on marriage and honeymoon break

[0:55:44] <+sonuke_draws> check mail
[0:55:45] <%baka_sugoi> E for EVERYBODYE GETTING THESE HANDS
[0:55:49] <+ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt no drip
[0:55:56] <Tomschiii> this looks axtually fun tbh
[0:55:57] <%andrewofbob> If Pat's wearing glasses, is he now a Bayo 3 character?
[0:56:02] <%Deft_Thought> Cool outfit, Dattebayo! I hope it helps you find your NINJA WAY 4Head
[0:56:09] <BackflipCharm> Check out the different weapons.
[0:56:11] <joodatious> @arkv01 ah thats good was a bit worried something bad happened
[0:56:15] <%cooldude69xx> @andrewofbob He's her new VA
[0:56:25] <tanarath> @patstaresat ninjala code is probably free item/resource codes
[0:56:28] <KingSpunf> They're trying, but this feels kinda dripless compared to Splatoon
[0:56:37] <MayorRev> It's in equipment @PatStaresAt
[0:56:38] <@Moobot> Hey check out Ninjala! It's cool and FREE! https://i.try.games/ninjala/ip8uzh
[0:56:38] <BigFingerRo> YOU'RE A KID NOW, YOU'RE A BOT NOW
[0:56:38] <%VitoXXI> equipment?
[0:56:39] <CappuccinoGuil> "I'm gonna sellout! That's MY ninja way!"
[0:56:41] <livehardman> check out my balls
[0:56:56] <MayorRev> All weapons are available for everyone, no unlockables
[0:56:59] <allanmiri> Oh hey are we going to a different stage this time?
[0:57:03] <%redthebaron> ninjala lore
[0:57:03] <@Ranryu692> wait
[0:57:09] <BigFingerRo> @CappuccinoGuil GEOFF STYLE: SHILL NO JATZ
[0:57:10] <+ScrapKingKeita> I think there is a Ninjala animated series
[0:57:12] <Tomschiii> damn, its Switch only:/
[0:57:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ninjala lore is deeper than Souls lore
[0:57:14] <@Ranryu692> THIS IS KATEKYO HITMAN REBORN
[0:57:20] <%bassoontyphoon> and turned into a child??
[0:57:21] <MayorRev> yep theres an animated series
[0:57:22] <allanmiri> Apparently there's animated youtube shorts for each character from what I've heard.
[0:57:22] <BackflipCharm> There was an equipment section you missed, yeah.
[0:57:31] <%cooldude69xx> How do you get into a match with humans?
[0:57:34] <cheapdoc> @Ranryu692 FUCK, you're right
[0:57:34] <+ikantreeed> it's michelle obama
[0:57:38] <@Spydurman> hoomans
[0:57:42] <%bassoontyphoon> ew, michelle
[0:57:45] <%RealThiele> with flesh and blood and not AI
[0:57:47] <Louie_Salmon> Why does this, ARMS, and splatoon all have to have lore about scientists to explain the arena video game
[0:57:48] <BigFingerRo> if they were humans, at least one of them would be called SUPERASSANOID69420
[0:57:51] <cheapdoc> These Arcobaleno looking motherfuckers
[0:58:01] <lilmac64> There's something about all the other characters doing a friendly wave while Pat's is just spasming
[0:58:03] <scrumbotime> Beat The Children! Beat The Children! Beat The Children!
[0:58:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat has to prove his strength in order to battle kindergarteners
[0:58:09] <%Deft_Thought> Game seems weighty in a weird way
[0:58:13] <+MoeScams> them sounds? bit thirsty no?
[0:58:18] <%BinaryFireball> turing test them pat
[0:58:20] <BigFingerRo> not very coordinated, like children
[0:58:22] <+FoolsArcade> Robots programmed to be children
[0:58:28] <+NobuuNobuu> Their names makes me think robots
[0:58:28] <+ikantreeed> There name is too generic to be ppl
[0:58:28] <%cooldude69xx> @Louie_Salmon Because gamers don't accept weird games on face value anymore
[0:58:28] <%redthebaron> they coded the ai to be like child
[0:58:32] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt be sure to complete the full tutorial, there's some good tech
[0:58:37] <allanmiri> They're bots that have been scientifically designed to be like children.
[0:58:47] <%greasypete00> think about that these bots hhave to be beatable by kids tho
[0:58:47] <BigFingerRo> Berreca?
[0:58:53] <BigFingerRo> what kinda name is that?
[0:58:59] <%chance_h> The games new so the robots are technically children
[0:59:03] <Mr_Rakjo> is pat bullying bots or the children?
[0:59:04] <%Puhff> Beffica???
[0:59:07] <%Deft_Thought> You'd probably be getting ganged up on a lot more if these were real kids
[0:59:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> They actually just locked a bunch of children in a room and force them to play instead of making bots
[0:59:15] <MayorRev> good combo
[0:59:17] <@SoFarFetched> Maybe their full name is Back Berreca Kappa
[0:59:18] <%cooldude69xx> @greasypete00 Nah, fuck them kids
[0:59:18] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 the blown bubbles almost look like pacifiers, too sbfpSetIn
[0:59:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> They trapped child souls in the game for this . they will be eternally scrubed
[0:59:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you regen hp over time
[0:59:41] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:59:46] <cheapdoc> Quick start using Mega fist
[0:59:49] <%RealThiele> regen over time
[0:59:53] <%SWFanatic> This IS just like sekiro
[0:59:53] <TrevIn3Dimensions> if you camoflauge you can heal
[0:59:58] <$Thatghostpepper> healing is from taking a disguise
[1:00:01] <AoiRob> you have regen
[1:00:03] <MayorRev> there's techniques you're missing out on in the tutorial, like gum morphing and gum boost dashing
[1:00:08] <%hrbeck_> when is Pat allowed to fight people?
[1:00:18] <lilmac64> They're robots FOR children.
[1:00:21] <Kain5707> so the game is dead?
[1:00:24] <%KishinGrek> what up my ninjas
[1:00:30] <+fetrigon> level 5 I think
[1:00:31] <allanmiri> Maybe after level 5?
[1:00:31] <%SWFanatic> after you spend money
[1:00:34] <$realm_forge> No child can match the cold nihilistic fury of a fully grown man in his early 30’s
[1:00:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Or there's no one playing
[1:00:35] <%MonkeyTimelord> Damn you, Skynet!
[1:00:35] <cheapdoc> Are there even real people playing this?
[1:00:36] <+ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt is it bot because nobody got the game yet?
[1:00:45] <BigFingerRo> @KishinGrek wow, the n-word? it's current year
[1:00:47] <%Monkeyweed21> first 5 levels appear to be bots
[1:00:56] <AoiRob> dude this game came out forever ago
[1:01:01] <%KishinGrek> didn't this have recent crossover?
[1:01:08] <MayorRev> niiiiiice
[1:01:12] <%hrbeck_> beeeg hot dog
[1:01:12] <+fetrigon> @ikantreeed games been out for a while
[1:01:15] <Saltmeisterr> @KishinGrek ye sonic

[1:01:29] <%SWFanatic> Pat > Baby Robot
[1:01:33] <+fetrigon> *game's
[1:01:34] <MayorRev> sonic, monhun, demon slayer, and hatsune miku
[1:01:36] <BigFingerRo> Man, I don't like these kids faces!
[1:01:37] <%KishinGrek> @saltmeisterr I thought it was demon slayer
[1:01:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> OVER NINE THOUSAAAND
[1:01:45] <%RealThiele> drone destroyer alright
[1:01:48] <cheapdoc> You should tell Woolie that this feels like Guns the Duel in a couple of weeks
[1:01:48] <Louie_Salmon> Oh it has mario party bonuses?
[1:01:50] <BigFingerRo> there's something weirdly shitkid-esque to these faces
[1:01:51] <+ikantreeed> @fetrigon oh really? damn
[1:01:52] <Saltmeisterr> @KishinGrek oh yeah that too
[1:01:54] <+NobuuNobuu> GJ tottaly not robot
[1:01:55] <Visorak6> Actually pat look at their levels, if theyre not level 1 they're definitely a real person
[1:02:03] <joodatious> Pat has now resorted to paying children to play with him so he can win in games
[1:02:05] <cheapdoc> Because you're always fighting bots
[1:02:08] <%tempestzephyr> Paige is posting dino porn on twitter psaPorgmo
[1:02:20] <+zuzuxiv> wtf is that a dragoon set

[1:11:21] <bubblegumhammer> Just so you know, most people don't use parries for ippons! You can gumbind people or break their guard/burst to get ippons as well. Most people combo into gumbinds, do guard break setups, and dash out of parries instead
[1:11:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> if statements are infinitely more powerful than a child's mind
[1:11:23] <%deviljhojho_> Arent some of the characters supposed to be short adults anyways

[1:40:24] <bubblegumhammer> @PatStaresAt You should generally try to avoid getting into rock paper scissors by gumbinding people with a couple gum shoots (which can be combo'd into) or breaking their guard or their burst with a break attack so they can't fight back. You can also use gum shoots to make them keep their guard up for the break attack to hit. Don't forget you can dash out of the parries too!

[1:56:29] <MayorRev> there's different break attacks for the glove weapons, use the stick @PatStaresAt
[1:56:30] <Keredersa18> Press R while pointing your Left Stick Up, Left/Right or Down.
[1:56:31] <allanmiri> Hey its that chick from Demon Slayer.
[1:56:33] <bubblegumhammer> Hold down and hit R for izuna drop
[1:56:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Is that the chick from Demon Slayer?
[1:56:35] <+fetrigon> yo
[1:56:43] <%DashXero> Was that that character from Demon Slayer?
[1:56:43] <%tusk102> it is
[1:56:46] <bubblegumhammer> You need to get them when they're guarding
[1:56:46] <mikedot> Yes, there was a Demon Slayer promo last month
[1:56:48] <TheDrown> Was a big Demon Slayer collab recently
[1:56:49] <MayorRev> yup
[1:56:49] <mikedot> YES
[1:56:52] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Wow, that's a cool crossover
[1:56:52] <%tusk102> nezuko is in the game
[1:56:54] <bubblegumhammer> The break you want looks like an uppercut
[1:57:08] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes they collab with Demon Slayer
[1:57:10] <mikedot> The next collab is Hatsune Miku
[1:57:26] <allanmiri> So they got a Demon Slayer cross over. Makes sense. Kids love decapitation.
[1:57:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> r e k t
[1:57:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Has Pat murdered the children yet?
[1:57:33] <allanmiri> No really. They do.

[1:59:21] <+radda343> these children are stomping your dick
[1:59:22] <allanmiri> Funny thing. For the longest time before looking up Demon Slayer properly I thought the girl was the main character cause she's the only one I ever saw people post screen shots and fanart of.
[1:59:23] <%andrewofbob> Is Pat in grown-up detention?
[1:59:26] <bubblegumhammer> So hit them like once and then break because they're babies and will burst immediately

[2:07:36] <bubblegumhammer> You can jump during combos to combo into gum shoot and gumbind people for ippons instead of playing rock paper scissors, although it's kind of complicated with Gum Ghost since it takes two shots. Drill would be easier since it has Grenade

[2:21:15] <@Moobot> Hey check out Ninjala! It's cool and FREE! https://i.try.games/ninjala/ip8uzh
[2:21:16] <mikedot> Was fun to watch Pat play Ninjala. Hope more people check the game out
[2:21:19] <allanmiri> @bubblegumhammer I might check it out in a bit myself. Looks kinda cute and there's not a whole lot of area fighters.
[2:21:24] <bubblegumhammer> I'm glad he did the izuna drop
[2:21:30] <MayorRev> EVERYONE GO CHECK OUT @bubblegumhammer if you wanna dive deep into The Tech Zone
[2:21:45] <MayorRev> he's got lots of neat tips for new and experience players

[2:21:59] <%cooldude69xx> @rumtumtugnutz The fattest turd
[2:22:02] <Meltgar> Any counter on how many times has Gief attacked or injured Pat/Paige?
[2:22:15] <bubblegumhammer> It's @hammerbubblegum actually, first one was taken
[2:22:20] <Meltgar> I only remember the "defense-mode" gief turned when paige was massaging pat
[2:22:23] <MayorRev> ahhh ok
[2:22:53] <allanmiri> @bubblegumhammer Me too. if there's an izuna drop Pat is pretty much obligated to show it off.
[2:22:59] <MayorRev> hope you all have fun! i know we sound like secret devs shilling but honestly we're just big fans of it lmao
[2:23:04] <bubblegumhammer> But yeah if you're gonna give it a shot I recommend learning gum shoot buffering/double-tap gum shoots! You can do combo with those to beat up children even harder
[2:23:10] <MayorRev> !ninjala
[2:23:24] <allanmiri> @bubblegumhammer Thanks for the tip.

[2:42:54] <otakon17> the issue is getting the money to do it
[2:42:55] <%BoxNavy> but for how long
[2:42:56] <Shion963> so it's that Forgotten Kingdom or something, but more?
[2:42:57] <%deviljhojho_> looks like a tuskless boar
[2:42:57] <Virokwet> goodest boy
[2:42:58] <%fugly_nick> Zangief hates smooches
[2:42:59] <@Lion_kun> So you only buy them once?
[2:42:59] <otakon17> THE BOY
[2:43:00] <%SWFanatic> what a baby
[2:43:00] <Profmcstevie> Look at all this fundamental information to HOW the game is played that wasn't answered till now......damn you John Marketing
[2:43:01] <%deviljhojho_> very impressive
[2:43:04] <%lumporr> lumporr is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[2:43:04] <%SWFanatic> bye
[2:43:04] <%lumporr> lumporr gifted a Tier 1 sub to Alzero83! 
[2:43:05] <acsn88> you've sold me on Deathloop more than any of trailers did. I must have zoned out during every trailer because I've watched pretty much every event where it was shown and had no idea what it actually was
[2:43:06] <otakon17> MY GOD HE IS SO BIG
[2:43:06] <%asgard147> Clean Fat boi limesAw psaDogchamp

[2:43:32] <%deviljhojho_> weren't people aware it was a majora dishonored game?
[2:43:33] <Kain5707> they kept changing it every time they showed the game
[2:43:33] <Profmcstevie> Premise I understood, HOW I did not ever know
[2:43:35] <%shootbang_exe> how can one game have so many trailers that collectively say so little
[2:43:38] <otakon17> it's an FPS roguelite
[2:43:39] <Visorak6> Is the woman who hunts you down as cool as the concept pitch was?
[2:43:43] <%polothegreatest> xbox is timed locked?
[2:43:45] <Arancet> they totally did
[2:43:48] <Srthunda> @deviljhojho_ no
[2:43:54] <Shion963> promo after promo after promo
[2:43:58] <%fugly_nick> That first trailer is the only one that I've seen, so this was all new to me
[2:43:59] <rufus2k2> yes it does
[2:44:00] <Profmcstevie> 8 targets, loop, enemy assassin
[2:44:00] <%nicoleymcquack> it sounds sick honestly
[2:44:03] <%Cerabret100> so does it end with you having to then do all successful kills in one loop?
[2:44:04] <%asgard147> GIMME psaDogchamp
[2:44:08] <Profmcstevie> But HOW that all plays out is never explained
[2:44:13] <%FacetiousAF> he is baby

[3:08:19] <$sleepystardewfarmer> don't forget your parry
[3:08:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cooldude69xx pain
[3:08:26] <otakon17> far as we could tlel, no
[3:08:34] <%topendbuzza> the jump
[3:08:37] <otakon17> you get nothing for destroying checkpoints besides making it harder for yourself
[3:08:39] <Lancaster_H> @cooldude69xx big pp
[3:08:46] <otakon17> your double jump is the parry, remember? Like Cuphead
[3:08:48] <ToneBacas> this is dank
[3:08:57] <SomeAsianDood> you get the guilt of having fucked up @cooldude69xx
[3:09:03] <%cooldude69xx> I like those things

[3:09:26] <otakon17> Goddamn I hope there are health upgrades for this game
[3:09:42] <+toastybites> seems like you need to git gud with parrying or else the game is gonna be rough
[3:09:49] <otakon17> the heck did you pick up anyway?
[3:09:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> I thought this was gonna be an enjoyable romp full of sigma grindset jokes
[3:09:55] <%BoxNavy> i have beaten every video game
[3:09:58] <otakon17> oh HELL no I SUCK at games like this
[3:09:59] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> hit me up in the DMS if you want to talk about how much better we are and video games than pat, chat
[3:10:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> instead it's pain full of sigma grindset jokes
[3:10:11] <Profmcstevie> Tweet your sick boss plays and victory screens to Pat on twitter, he'll love you being better than him
[3:10:14] <@Ranryu692> watching you and Woolie play video games has made me better at playing video games
[3:10:14] <otakon17> this would kick my ass JUST as many times so far if not MORE

[3:10:35] <afromexicano> We’re definitely better than streamer Pat but idk about regular pat
[3:10:37] <otakon17> like if it weren't for the Ichor Blooms it wouldn't be THAT difficult
[3:10:40] <otakon17> but CRIPES
[3:10:43] <maybefalco> this beginning part was also difficult for me
[3:10:45] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> hey, I think you're perfectly adequate at Metroid kbsGhost
[3:10:52] <%cooldude69xx> I am
[3:10:52] <Lancaster_H> this is NOT the sigma grindset i came here for
[3:10:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Taunt the sax pat
[3:10:56] <otakon17> you basically destroy any place you can stand and you can only double jump once
[3:10:59] <@Ranryu692> no
[3:11:03] <otakon17> so you NEED to parry or you're screwed
[3:11:04] <Darkrenai> LUL
[3:11:06] <SomeAsianDood> Kappa
[3:11:06] <%WhereIsWill> but nago tho
[3:11:12] <%BoxNavy> you couldnt beat woolie even a one time
[3:11:14] <@goose_attack_almanac> Is this the Sigma male grindset
[3:11:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> remember when Pat beat up Woolie for real
[3:11:15] <Silly_Duckling> Where does Postman Pat fall on that spectrum of Pat Powerscaling?

[3:11:35] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> GET HIM, CHAT sajamStare
[3:11:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige you would punch pat if you could get the chance
[3:11:45] <%WhereIsWill> what about a good clean fair fight pat?
[3:11:47] <%Bt_Robot> It's almost like he created an empty hallway where you could practice his in the tutorial, and you skipped it.
[3:11:51] <@SoFarFetched> angriestpat would have change for a 20 geefNo

[3:12:07] <%SWFanatic> its fine
[3:12:07] <MoonKing> that's a great game over screen
[3:12:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> It has definitely not been an hour
[3:12:08] <%MelBrooksKA> The best time to make fun of someone is in Twitch chat @PatStaresAt
[3:12:09] <@Ranryu692> you can turn down the difficulty LUL
[3:12:11] <@Jekado> depends are you counting the time you are dead as play time?
[3:12:13] <%fugly_nick> You've been playing for like 10 minutes Pat
[3:12:19] <%Bt_Robot> *by his I mean this and by this I mean parrying
[3:12:23] <otakon17> apparently you can turn down the difficulty
[3:12:34] <%WhereIsWill> 30 seconds
[3:12:34] <kazadaz> Thems are some heavy explosions
[3:12:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> closer to 20 I think
[3:12:39] <%king_wragles> you're not even done with the tutorial
[3:12:42] <Silly_Duckling> Time Dilation
[3:12:48] <otakon17> well from the looks of things you can't just jump sTRAIGHT up to dodge or you'll just fall on top of Ichor Blooms
[3:12:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat you just started this game what are you talking about
[3:12:52] <Lancaster_H> what build are you using pat? Kappa
[3:12:52] <%nicoleymcquack> it feels like 3
[3:12:57] <maybefalco> 40 seconds, take it or leave it
[3:12:59] <RushUnplugged> it's been FIVE HUNDRED YEAAARSSS
[3:13:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> the suffering makes it feel longer
[3:13:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> ;)
[3:13:07] <%SWFanatic> time is an illusion, lunch time doubly so
[3:13:09] <Renkage> Correct. You have played for EXACTLY 45 seconds
[3:13:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> You didn't even start the game this is the main menu
[3:13:10] <@Ranryu692> you haven't even reached the start menu dude
[3:13:13] <%shurtal> about 30 minutes
[3:13:19] <%fugly_nick> Crazy Talk Activate
[3:13:24] <%AyotoCorp> Pat should try out some of the alternate graphics settings, some of them are WILD.  And bad
[3:13:26] <+toastybites> youve been playing ninjala this whole time
[3:13:26] <afromexicano> The controller isn’t connected, it’s the arcade reel
[3:13:32] <+JustToWatch> have you tried not getting hit
[3:13:33] <%ThomasOfTroy> I checked the vod, it's been about 35 minutes
[3:13:35] <%SWFanatic> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:13:39] <%king_wragles> oh wait, it might be like 40 minutes ya
[3:13:40] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> 45 Seconds later...
[3:13:54] <%king_wragles> but uh, you're still really close to the start of the game
[3:13:59] <kazadaz> if I remember FNF right, Pat saying "I think I got it now" means he does not got it
[3:14:00] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't believe Pat's 2.67% through the game
[3:14:10] <SomeAsianDood> Just lame it out
[3:14:10] <otakon17> you'd think the ENEMIES would take damage from the Ichor Blooms too
[3:14:17] <otakon17> but somehow they're immune when you are not
[3:14:23] <@SoFarFetched> I can't wait for the game to say "YOU'VE FINISHED THE TUTORIAL"
[3:14:34] <%OrangeMDT> Just got here, and I am so confused
[3:14:38] <%Bt_Robot> Because it was blue, like your father
[3:14:39] <otakon17> I guess because it's blue not read?
[3:14:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> very nice
[3:14:48] <%cooldude69xx> He's doing it!
[3:14:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> clean even
[3:14:54] <Lancaster_H> S A D
[3:15:02] <otakon17> @OrangeMDT this is a REALLY hard metroidvania with a Cuphead parry and VERY little forgiveness for mistakes
[3:15:05] <+JustToWatch> BALLS EXPOSED
[3:15:10] <%WhereIsWill> @cooldude69xx psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:15:11] <LoneFonte> just got here, this looks like Iji
[3:15:24] <%Arweynn> psaBig S A D
[3:15:37] <%fugly_nick> This game is so easy man, can't believe Pat's doing so bad
[3:15:37] <otakon17> okay yo've been playing at least 25 minutes now and the game has been manhandling you soundly
[3:15:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> its like as soon as you make a single mistake it compounds and then you're dead
[3:15:50] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> @patstaresat  Do either Gief or Emlo ever sit in front of the Buscemi picture and just stare at it?
[3:16:15] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I like how Pat says oh no in this stream
[3:16:24] <%WhereIsWill> this game screamin "parry or die" LUL
[3:16:32] <otakon17> thank goodness for regen health
[3:16:40] <%ThomasOfTroy> @BlowFireThroatTotem Gief did that early in the stream today
[3:16:47] <otakon17> MINIBOSS TIME!
[3:16:47] <%Gelphaze> there are no cheat shot in a fight, you just got to make sure your first hit is your last hit.
[3:16:48] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:16:53] <%fugly_nick> Okay that looked pretty hard to manage
[3:16:53] <+JustToWatch> WOOOOOO
[3:16:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> GOT ON THAT GRINDSET
[3:16:56] <Lancaster_H> @WhereIsWill "Parry or perish"
[3:17:00] <@goose_attack_almanac> THE SIGMA GRINDESET
[3:17:02] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> wow that escalated rather rapidly
[3:17:06] <SomeAsianDood> Learn the mechanics pat Kappa
[3:17:08] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> is this game my parents or something?
[3:17:08] <otakon17> yeah you GOTTA parry or they just fill up the screen with death
[3:17:13] <%shurtal> you've now been playing for about 40 minutes
[3:17:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you're just not grinding hard enough Pat
[3:17:28] <$sleepystardewfarmer> the lack of savepoints make it really nerve racking and changes how you play, a really cool mechanic!
[3:17:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean you really gotta hustle
[3:17:32] <%The_Protagonist> does the kicking bullets back not work on these?
[3:17:34] <$sleepystardewfarmer> scary tho lol
[3:17:34] <%WhereIsWill> that sekiro style of "NO, you WILL PARRY"
[3:17:43] <Explodincatz> is there no other weapon?
[3:17:53] <otakon17> not yet
[3:17:56] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Pat's reaction to this game is the same as mine too bad indigestion
[3:18:00] <otakon17> he's still in the BEGINNING AREA
[3:18:02] <AoiRob> the game said "Parry. Or Else."
[3:18:10] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> oh no, oh man...
[3:18:24] <Lancaster_H> oh jeez
[3:18:26] <%The_Protagonist> oh the kicking the bullets back DOES work
[3:18:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> that walk is so good
[3:18:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's what a hustle looks like
[3:18:45] <%Arancet> Arancet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Good job using your big man skills to sell the childrens game and the superman game. How well does Deathloop run and use the haptics on PS5? Also pet Greg and Elmo for us.
[3:18:53] <%SWFanatic> Remerai > Big Gummy Wummy
[3:18:54] <DracaenaLeaf> dang
[3:18:54] <%chance_h> Nah it’s in space Pat
[3:18:54] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:19:09] <%Ne1son> Parry or Die
[3:19:09] <%WhereIsWill> wild
[3:19:12] <%Arweynn> Pat you need to stop standing in the red
[3:19:14] <@Ranryu692> cool Gowron impression
[3:19:14] <otakon17> okay HOW are you supposed to handle being attacked from THREE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
[3:19:15] <%Deft_Thought> Greg LUL
[3:19:17] <%cooldude69xx> There are difficulty settings, right?
[3:19:18] <%fugly_nick> He wants to switch games so bad
[3:19:24] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> now he's hunching over and breathing heavy, exactly how I act when I've got bad poops
[3:19:40] <Parapattern> Just do it perfect every time
[3:19:45] <%SWFanatic> is this anor londo?
[3:19:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> fun fact: if you get hit you lose health
[3:19:49] <%cooldude69xx> @otakon17 With a 5 frame long parry of course
[3:19:49] <otakon17> at least you don't take damage from enemy contact
[3:19:53] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:19:54] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Yes
[3:19:55] <BigFingerRo> Such a Disappointment: The Unauthorized Biography of Pat "Fuck dem Kids and Fuck Superman" Boivin

[3:20:30] <homestylewaffles> uncle paulie got a robot in 4
[3:20:32] <MrMegaJackpots> paulie keeps winning
[3:20:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pauly is awful
[3:20:34] <%Bt_Robot> ROBOT WIFE
[3:20:34] <willsin4fun> Ey Rocky why dont ya fuck my sister
[3:20:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> what prompted this Rocky plot analysis?
[3:20:41] <otakon17> hey Paulie, who nearly got fired from his meat job
[3:20:41] <+TungstenViper> they just go softer on him because they're rich LUL
[3:20:43] <%JoshManVGH> He got that robot that one time
[3:20:48] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> the part where all those kids wash his feet was really strange
[3:20:52] <otakon17> I dunno, Rocky treats him well
[3:20:58] <%JoshManVGH> 4
[3:21:00] <%shurtal> 3
[3:21:02] <+twohitgood> that would be rocky 4 with the robot.
[3:21:04] <BigFingerRo> the what now?
[3:21:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> What?
[3:21:06] <%king_wragles> BUT HE'S WHY THE ROBOT WAS THERE TO BEGIN WITH
[3:21:08] <Parapattern> The robot is the most memorable thing
[3:21:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Probably not a bad idea
[3:21:10] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> 3
[3:21:10] <+kewlmyc> He's not wrong. The robot is weird as fuck.
[3:21:11] <%fugly_nick> ...there's a robot?
[3:21:12] <Xiangchang> Happy Birthday Paulie. Beep Boop.
[3:21:12] <otakon17> nah keep the robot
[3:21:15] <%JoshManVGH> "HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAULIE!"
[3:21:15] <otakon17> it's a sign of the times

[3:21:22] <heli0hso> wait a robot?
[3:21:22] <otakon17> yeah they get a robot "butler"
[3:21:23] <afromexicano> At least he wasn’t a racist like in the original script
[3:21:23] <%WhereIsWill> 4 is the best one tbh
[3:21:24] <Explodincatz> the Russian?
[3:21:26] <%king_wragles> I hate everything now
[3:21:31] <homestylewaffles> I appreciate that stallone understands regret but what's done is done
[3:21:32] <+radda343> Sly "George Lucas" Stalone
[3:21:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> you could be making all that up and I'd never know
[3:21:41] <@ssjklyco> Just CG a kid as the butler
[3:21:46] <%JoshManVGH> And some how Paulie turned it into a sexbot.
[3:22:02] <DracaenaLeaf> did it
[3:22:03] <%fugly_nick> Such an accomplishment
[3:22:04] <%SWFanatic> phew
