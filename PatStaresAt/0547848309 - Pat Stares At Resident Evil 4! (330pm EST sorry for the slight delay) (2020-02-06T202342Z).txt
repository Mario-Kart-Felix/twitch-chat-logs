[0:12:54] <%ittla> I'll never level my crafters because I'm too busy being a Real Artist
[0:12:55] <%jimmypurple> i would watch the SHIT outta that
[0:12:55] <%Faustgesicht> So is the new relic stuff Eureka 2.0?
[0:12:56] <%ElenaManetta> but only stream it if you're gonna talk to us about stuff like ball slime and eating 100 babies
[0:12:57] <%rytisone> like FF7
[0:12:57] <%drdemenz> FFXIV is the new Religion
[0:12:57] <%Niney_Who> Like RE6 Kappa
[0:12:59] <badzombie28> Yes
[0:13:00] <%vvitchguy> FF14 for Pat -time? Idk you do you.
[0:13:01] <Renuarb> XIV would be a great offschedule stream
[0:13:02] <%WhereIsWill> its a balancing act for sure
[0:13:02] <%AncelDeLambert> a game like FF7?!
[0:13:02] <+preston_the_lesser> RE4 REMAKE WHEN

[0:13:59] <%Faustgesicht> Oh no This is the RE420 stream?
[0:14:02] <%moogleboy1984> Pat could be the less aggressive Xenosys
[0:14:04] <%Ganerumo> How excited would you be if capcom started remaking/rereleasing weirdass prototypes like 1.5 and hookman demo
[0:14:09] <%shurtal> DO so much damage to that landmass
[0:14:09] <%Dementedpenguin> When I first saw that statue in my playthrough, I was like "Sure."
[0:14:13] <+preston_the_lesser> god please remake RE4 i know it holds up still but i would nut
[0:14:14] <SomersaultJustice> like a pro
[0:14:17] <%arsonistdaria> bolt action is pretty good

[0:14:27] <%Ganerumo> RE4 remake with RE7 controls
[0:14:28] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> I'm watching part 1 of this after an insane 28 hours of helping my friend become a dad, staying the night on standby at the hospital
[0:14:31] <SoaringLettuce> i played a couple weeks ago, the bolt action is gonna be a bitch against the regenerators
[0:14:32] <%drdemenz> @ell1ot Could you imagine how big Sadler's statue would be?
[0:14:35] <%snapchat_ads> snapchat_ads subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:14:40] <+necrocannibal2> RE4 needs a remake like the Gears of War one, where only the graphics were upgraded
[0:14:45] <%Jaxnos> video games are ok
[0:14:45] <+necrocannibal2> and the gameplay was kept intact

[0:15:38] <%Jaxnos> look on the bright side Pat, now you sound like a deeper voiced shortie
[0:15:39] <malletman241> you gotta blow your ass
[0:15:39] <heartlesshealer> blowing is for when it's runny or already loose
[0:15:40] <%joylent_blue> HeyGuys
[0:15:41] <+professormorrigan> he's infected. this entire stream must be purged.

[0:15:42] <+allups> he doesnt have to leave to smoke there are many 420 streams
[0:15:56] <%Konquerer> i miss dead space
[0:16:02] <+necrocannibal2> @XeroSigmaPrime yeah, but it's way more significant because it's an entirely new engine and all. basically a modern game where they imported the mechanics of the old game.
[0:16:04] <chambatron> Can you play it on ps3?
[0:16:08] <%ClericOfSparda> hey Pat have you seen the Ff14 new 5.2 live letter stuff?
[0:16:11] <%rytisone> thanks EA
[0:16:16] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> meh i prefer ds9
[0:16:17] <GoodShotCam> I played through it w/ a gamepad no prob, what exactly was the problem?
[0:16:18] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:16:18] <+necrocannibal2> Xbox
[0:16:19] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:16:20] <%Psyramics> would mean plugging the ps3 back in
[0:16:25] <+necrocannibal2> it's backwards compat, I think
[0:16:25] <%bigdumbidiotguy> zbox
[0:16:29] <%Conyst> stupid EA ruining Deadspace
[0:16:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PC MASTER RACE
[0:16:30] <%Jaxnos> just missed him talking about it Sparda
[0:16:37] <%Rumbutt> @ClericOfSparda You just missed him talking about it
[0:16:39] <%adventurerjess> did it used to work on pc? cuz i originally played it on pc with controller
[0:16:43] <%President_Miyazaki> Wanna use PC to use a controller.
[0:16:44] <%President_Miyazaki> I see.
[0:16:46] <%Chatterbox1991> there are a fuck ton of classic games EA refuses to put out in HD, just ask fans of The Sims 1 and 2
[0:16:47] <%ShichiNoBushi> Be sure to tighten up the graphics on Level 3.
[0:16:49] <SoaringLettuce> we'll see if the ps5 is backwards compatible with ps3
[0:16:50] <ArtificialDeity> What controller do you use?
[0:16:50] <%Dragovus> Pat has to play on PC or Paige will yell at him for all the money he spent on it
[0:16:51] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I wanna play Obama gamesphree
[0:16:59] <Bailey__gaming> I enjoy video games
[0:17:13] <%TRILLTURBAN> TRILLTURBAN subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Pat, loving your streams so far in this new year! Quick question, if I've never played a Final Fantasy game before, would the FF7 remake be a good starting point?
[0:17:18] <%Chatterbox1991> Thanks for the LuvBlondeL @trillturban
[0:17:20] <heartlesshealer> It's hard to be satisfied with it unless you're super into Armored Core
[0:17:20] <%majima666> if the ps5 can somehow be bc with the ps3 then that will seal it for me
[0:17:21] <SoaringLettuce> im a fan of armored core and its shocking considering my first game was Last Raven
[0:17:22] <%Kilagn> Just replayed Armored Core 4 Answer and it was amazing
[0:17:27] <ShineTheDiamond> I'm more interested to see if the PS5 will be compatible with the PS2 games.
[0:17:28] <%laserbeaming> Armored Core feels weird to play. I like the customization though
[0:17:31] <%majima666> but we'll have to see
[0:17:32] <%bigdumbidiotguy> zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan zfgToucan
[0:17:32] <gekizenbu> >Armored Core >in the current time
[0:17:33] <%Rumbutt> DARK CORE
[0:17:34] <+SlappyMeats> DARK CORE
[0:17:40] <%ittla> when I played ZOE 1 and 2 I thought i'd like mecha games then oops
[0:17:43] <chambatron> It already exists. It's called The Surge
[0:17:44] <%majima666> ps3 was an awkward system to work with
[0:17:46] <%ittla> armored core is NOT like zoe
[0:17:51] <%happyface699> That’s a good name
[0:17:54] <heartlesshealer> Like, you can feel the awesome, but satisfaction disappears
[0:17:57] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Fart Souls PogChamp
[0:17:59] <SoaringLettuce> the controls are fully customizable, you can make it have good controls
[0:18:01] <%laserbeaming> The Surge is not at all like Armored Core
[0:18:01] <%arsonistdaria> remember chromehounds
[0:18:01] <stabbityrabbit> I really wouldn't be surprised if the next Armored Core ends up playing a lot more like Dark Souls.
[0:18:03] <%rytisone> Ada makes pp go up
[0:18:03] <%Kilagn> There are no mech games out as good as AC games FeelsBadMan
[0:18:09] <%ElenaManetta> imagine streaming for years
[0:18:12] <%happyface699> Much up
[0:18:13] <%ElenaManetta> imagine streaming for 1 day

[0:19:07] <stabbityrabbit> Did Pat talk about the EVO line up previously, and I just missed it? MvC:2 getting in is nuts.
[0:19:09] <%adventurerjess> never broke my foots
[0:19:10] <ArtificialDeity> Is PatStaresAt a Pat from a different dimension like that episode of Rick and Morty with the cronenberg monsters?
[0:19:11] <SoaringLettuce> oh yeah comparing AC to Souls: AC started the strafing battles between players and the rings are clearly optional parts
[0:19:11] <+TheDragonOfTheBlackPool> Hi Pat I’m a new follower. I wish I had your hairline.
[0:19:15] <%happyface699> Hits bad
[0:19:15] <%nofestu2> @joylent_blue you get no simpy
[0:19:16] <deviljhojho_> hmmm
[0:19:19] <heartlesshealer> uhhhhh
[0:19:19] <%bigdumbidiotguy> do u like cyanide pizza @patstaresat
[0:19:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> NO
[0:19:23] <%VashyronM> No, play 6
[0:19:24] <+necrocannibal2> maybe
[0:19:24] <+Diabetic> ....that's not....
[0:19:24] <+theobble> No comma bitch
[0:19:26] <%Sir_stride> PLAY 10 FIRST
[0:19:27] <chambatron> No play FFX and FFX-2
[0:19:30] <Bailey__gaming> Sympy is my fave
[0:19:31] <%Ner234> Not ... really ?
[0:19:31] <%majima666> play 8
[0:19:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Start with FF4
[0:19:34] <%AncelDeLambert> play the original
[0:19:34] <deviljhojho_> perhaps
[0:19:35] <Roz_Lynd> PATRICK!! I GOT STITCHES OUT! and it feels so good
[0:19:35] <+necrocannibal2> FFX is old as fuck
[0:19:36] <heartlesshealer> At least 'try' 6
[0:19:36] <%ittla> just pick any of em
[0:19:37] <%oddslogic> FF4
[0:19:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> START 15
[0:19:37] <%adventurerjess> any FF is a good FF to start
[0:19:38] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, They're self contained
[0:19:38] <%rytisone> I only played 7 and crisis core
[0:19:38] <%ittla> jump around
[0:19:39] <+necrocannibal2> let's be honest
[0:19:39] <%Konquerer> play X-2 first
[0:19:42] <%theKingRamses> ff starts at 13-2
[0:19:42] <BMPixy> Play a good series of games instead
[0:19:43] <heartlesshealer> to get used to item and spell names
[0:19:43] <deviljhojho_> just play what you want bro tomatoSmile
[0:19:44] <SomersaultJustice> eh
[0:19:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> star with Dark Souls II
[0:19:46] <%TRILLTURBAN> y'all these answers aren't helpful :(
[0:19:46] <%hahaha1171> play 15
[0:19:47] <+Mr_Quail> PLAY 14
[0:19:48] <RagingLeo> most of FF isn't connected anyway
[0:19:48] <%ittla> the nice thing about FF is that you can just pick one
[0:19:49] <%majima666> start with 8 like i did, learn the hard way
[0:19:50] <%WhereIsWill> BEAT FF11 OR GTFO
[0:19:51] <%TRILLTURBAN> thx u pat
[0:19:52] <%Jaxnos> it's a good starting point, but it'll play different from everything before it except 15
[0:19:53] <+TheDragonOfTheBlackPool> Hi Pat I’m a new follower. I wish I had your hairline.
[0:19:53] <chambatron> Play 16
[0:19:54] <Renuarb> FF7R wouldn't play like any other FF in the series, so you'd have a harder time branching out
[0:19:55] <%joylent_blue> play new shiny thing, if you like that then do whatever
[0:19:56] <%tigerfang86> Chat is being MULTIPLE GUYS
[0:19:57] <%AncelDeLambert> psa1guy
[0:19:57] <%apostateCourier> FF7R will spoil you in the "oh the rest of the series is crap" kinda way
[0:20:00] <%Sir_stride> X is the easiest to get into
[0:20:01] <The_500lb_Child> Play 13 its the best.
[0:20:02] <Alseid> It's a whole different game wearing FF7's pimped out skin. You can start with it but if you do you're a fool for shinny grafix
[0:20:02] <+tweedler92> START WITH DIRGE
[0:20:03] <%Faustgesicht> 10 can die in fire
[0:20:04] <%apostateCourier> but do it anyway
[0:20:05] <+Diabetic> I'd say play 5 or 6 on mobile at the least then do 7...
[0:20:05] <a_mad_dragon> the correct answer is that there is NO good starting point, the games are all taht much different
[0:20:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> PLAY TACTICS, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8 IN THAT ORDER
[0:20:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't listen to Pat, he's crazy
[0:20:06] <%NitronStreams> all ffs are basically different series
[0:20:08] <deviljhojho_> waow
[0:20:09] <%bigdumbidiotguy> play Alpha Chimp @patstaresat
[0:20:11] <ShineTheDiamond> We're your morons, Pat.
[0:20:13] <+garagon31> Play 13-2

[0:32:07] <stabbityrabbit> Did they ever have an RE game where it's mostly zombies like REmake: 2, with a few crazy guys interspersed? It seems like that would've been the natural mid-point between RE: 2/3 and RE: 4.
[0:32:12] <%ospreyworks> I’m so glad I skipped on superbowl and missed all the context of baby nut

[0:42:03] <SomersaultJustice> Pat has achieved Zen and is no longer Angry
[0:42:05] <%Kilagn> Rebranding because he found an Angrier Pat
[0:42:06] <%tiaramaki> I've never seen that happen before

[0:42:48] <%ElenaManetta> not smooth sailing
[0:42:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you know, if you shoot them while they're still on the platform with the wide spread of the shotgun,, you can get a lot of em before they enter the cart.

[0:48:57] <Ahk_90> Time to make an AngriestPat Twitch channel!
[0:48:57] <%Mr_Pylon> LaziestPat confirmed
[0:48:57] <+theobble> Yeah the SBFP final vid... I didn't think about that

[0:49:12] <%AkronymCLT> Remember you can shoot the door lock from here
[0:49:13] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You're inviting someone to take your old name
[0:49:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is totaly a pat thing pat would do
[0:49:15] <KaliasTV> You could just batch remove all the descriptions, or replace them with the same text
[0:49:15] <%tigerfang86> @MajorCrasher remember that time in the LP when pat totally shit his pants tho
[0:49:15] <mMayrro> Compensating statue PogChamp
[0:49:17] <%Kegeto> oh god i remeber
[0:49:17] <%KingKZ> This is the dumbest room in the game.
[0:49:19] <%ElenaManetta> Why not buy a domain name under Google for $12/year that way no matter what happens or what changes in the future, people can always go to the domain name?
[0:49:21] <%pilgrimsayswhat> this game jumps the shark so hard continuously
[0:49:22] <%godzookylives> Pat needs a giant robot statue
[0:49:22] <%trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt you can shoot the lock from here
[0:49:24] <+professormorrigan> Everyone should have their own giant mechanized statue :)
[0:49:26] <%BionoidLCR> @DracaenaLeaf nope its just his dick LUL
[0:49:29] <Ahk_90> It ain't hard copying an eyeball
[0:49:34] <%zamzoph> ever?
[0:49:35] <+PleasantLee> The real REAL problem is 'Pat Stares At' isnt that great of a name
[0:49:45] <Lophostrix_> why not, thats dumb

[0:50:54] <mrjplays2k9> paige is awake after last nights mess

[0:52:59] <Ahk_90> This looks like a GREAT D&D dungeon
[0:53:02] <stabbityrabbit> Why would he build a statue of himself that raises its hands up and down for no discernable reason?
[0:53:05] <+PleasantLee> gonna go watch you eli and paige get mad at each other playing that thing from yesterday. any idea when the ds9 watching begin?

[0:53:10] <%Xooler67> @bionoidlcr whoops my bad
[0:53:11] <j0ustar> You know, it's really hard to beat a "CONTAINED MAGMA"B-movie room in a game, and yet here we are. RE4 defeated itself.
[0:53:13] <@commanderclaw> Harder to get guns in Europe probably
[0:53:18] <%DukeMoose> sadler got a discount by buying the same pictures in bulk
[0:53:18] <cureneckbeard> Maybe if they didn't spend so much money on treasure that they leave lying around in jars
[0:53:19] <%DerKupo> still love bougie pat.
[0:53:19] <%ElenaManetta> They spent the whole budget on this fucking 100-acre land
[0:53:20] <%toolofparanoia> Salazar is a literal walking Napolean complex
[0:53:21] <+RadDude6969> they also get mounted machine guns
[0:53:21] <jeffishype> they spent all their money on just the one gun.
[0:53:22] <+necrocannibal2> they're poorly funded yet they have funds to make this huge useless statue
[0:53:31] <%ha2ken> The Woolie cult would contribute...
[0:53:32] <krymzen5> damn plagas never sent me my keychain

[1:10:55] <thelonechris> He doesn't even care LUL
[1:10:56] <%blondie_ow> No RPG cheese?

[1:11:03] <Captain_Pugbot> I forgot how wild this game was

[1:11:29] <JetpackMcQuack> 140 more where that came from
[1:11:38] <CaptainKayla3917> i have never done this fight without the rocket launcher
[1:11:42] <%ha2ken> This boss fight is automatically lamer just because it's Salazar...just saying.
[1:11:42] <KaliasTV> Kid lost the moment he took his napoleon hat off
[1:11:43] <%dekkitout> That was quite the combat roll, Leon
[1:11:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @EsotericOdyssey Honestly how to Zombies and G virus work?
[1:11:44] <$ItsRatman> Is that what it sounds like to get shot?
[1:11:50] <%lionandfox21> @esotericodyssey Probably consumes tons of bio mass and produces a fuck ton of hormones would be my guess
[1:11:50] <Cynical2DD> Oh my god Pat is using the TMP? What have I been missing all this time
[1:11:54] <Zedimonx5> No simpy for big monster quiettBuen
[1:11:59] <markuskydd> me big brain SMOrc me use RPG SMOrc
[1:12:00] <+necrocannibal2> DJ KHALED
[1:12:02] <+necrocannibal2> REMIX
[1:12:04] <mannywatcha> Yeah but still feels better to have the minion also fight as it was before. But then again this is exactly the stuff that happens. Monster transforms and actually gets weaker then its original.
[1:12:06] <EsotericOdyssey> @doc_ock_rokc fair
[1:12:07] <mrjplays2k9> THE FRAME RATE

[1:12:27] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> sounds like chex quest
[1:12:28] <%alcors_wisdom> its because they never thought anyone would actually use the TMP
[1:12:31] <%blondie_ow> UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-UGH-

[1:12:45] <mrjplays2k9> NICE JOB IDIOT
[1:12:54] <oniwahoo> @mannywatcha Definitely seems like his other minion would do fantastic in a place where you can't just freeze it a bunch
[1:12:58] <EsotericOdyssey> @lionandfox21 like you figure he had the meat mass stored up to turn little lord fauntelroy into the hivemind controller?

[1:14:47] <%Ipsenscastle> I like when Pat is competent, it makes me feel like anything is possible
[1:14:48] <%joylent_blue> yeah he'd drop a mantle not a gem

[1:15:05] <CaptainKayla3917> im stuck on Krauser on pro mode. like pulling teeth
[1:15:23] <%rytisone> Salazar's biggest mistake was that he stood between Leon and Ada

[1:31:06] <%SirGO0SE> It's fucking astonishing Resident Evil was a successful franchise. Most of the series is mediocre or terrible. Out of the entire series 1/2/3/4/REmake/RER2 are classics. 5/7/Revelations 2 are really good. Revelations and the Outbreaks are cool. The rest are middling to trash.

[2:05:03] <krymzen5> LUL sploosh
[2:05:04] <$Dakuu75> WOW... that's a STRONG opener

[2:05:16] <%happyface699> No fun allowed
[2:05:16] <MadDesperado13> Outside stinks
[2:05:17] <%ha2ken> Find a partner that accepts your not-funness
[2:05:19] <%stoccton> no :)
[2:05:20] <BoomerUnchained> Fun is stupid and for idiots
[2:05:21] <%Kegeto> Paige can drive those carts around
[2:05:22] <%ElenaManetta> pat is correct
[2:05:24] <ShineTheDiamond> He's about 'staying at home' fun
[2:05:25] <kvassimoto> LUL
[2:05:27] <%DukeMoose> but then you say "So she forced me to go to the thing i thought wouldnt be fun, and had a great time of it"
[2:05:28] <Unicyclemonkey> Fuck off pat
[2:05:29] <%SirGO0SE> Sex? NO FUN
[2:05:35] <%ElenaManetta> in fact pat disappoints me with his recent ventures of smoking weed because that's too fun and i hate fun as well also
[2:05:37] <%AkronymCLT> Pat with the soft sell
[2:05:39] <+phytopath> Don't try to engage Pat's enthusiasm. . He doesn't have one.
[2:05:39] <xandarith> How did you guys meet?
[2:05:40] <$Dakuu75> I'm having FUN right NOW but... it's a reflex and involuntary
[2:05:42] <%ha2ken> He hates it
[2:05:43] <%Chatterbox1991> GODDAMN IT I CHECKED IT OFF ALREADY
[2:05:44] <%ElenaManetta> i can't relate to pat unless he avoids fun like me
[2:05:45] <mrjplays2k9> whats the point of doing these?
[2:05:47] <%dekkitout> Damn, you're an unusual little goblin aren't ya
[2:05:47] <+PaniniPanzer> fun not allowed; I'm almost enjoying my anger
[2:05:49] <%Chatterbox1991> FUCK

[2:07:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige the reason why is because its a big cloked figure with guns underneath his coat....so its probably a bad idea to be him

[2:21:48] <TofuNyan> Give me one of those ;-;
[2:21:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @MrBorisMakarov YOU MADLAD
[2:21:50] <%Grayhammatter> suns pretty much down
[2:21:51] <%Wallabri> Thanks for the LuvUok @mrborismakarov
[2:21:52] <%valkuma> Isnt that a huge waste of Rifle ammo ?
[2:22:00] <heartlesshealer> as long as it's 1v1
[2:22:01] <%legendscar01> no not a waste
[2:22:01] <%tigerfang86> they stagger so hard when you kill a leech
[2:22:01] <%Kegeto> pat.exe stop working
[2:22:02] <sharpster78> golf clap
[2:22:04] <42nfl19> So how balls hard is this if you DONT have the thermal scope? @PatStaresAt
[2:22:05] <%tigerfang86> it's fine
[2:22:07] <%akumakins> I think its the later ones with way more plagas
[2:22:07] <Daxalog> What if you dont have the rifle here
[2:22:09] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt the gun looks dumb now
[2:22:16] <%tigerfang86> YOU look dumb now
[2:22:16] <%Aydarkzero> @valkuma it's the intended way to kill them
[2:22:18] <OToole42> hell no, 3 rifle rounds instead of 18 shotgun
[2:22:21] <%natebud> Wow I missed a lot.
[2:22:26] <%incredibleCrayon> Is there another way?
[2:22:27] <Shadope342> leeches are unshootable without scope?
[2:22:27] <Magpiejake> no its not
[2:22:27] <+professormorrigan> you can guess where the parasites are 4Head
[2:22:28] <TomFrank> not impossible you can kill them with just damage
[2:22:30] <+PaniniPanzer> is that the doom door noise?
[2:22:31] <%incredibleCrayon> This is what I did
[2:22:32] <%valkuma> Oh i just remembered them popping when the nodes died because i did the same thing
[2:22:38] <%DedlokPM> @valkuma 2 shots versus like 12 shotgun? I would say it is worth
[2:22:38] <%Mekhet09> It's a lot of fuck guesswork.
[2:22:40] <$lotharrio> Near impossible without a thermal. Lots of grenades or TMP sprinkling.
[2:22:41] <+VHGS> @incredibleCrayon shoot different spots until you hit all the plagas by luck?
[2:22:41] <Varadox> @PatStaresAt You can actually still use the TPM as a way to spray them until you hit a leach. So not impossible.
[2:22:43] <%SoaringLettuce> when i played it they had parasites on their backs, thats weird
[2:22:45] <OrpheusXP> Woolie finishing Death Strading right now!
[2:22:46] <%Aydarkzero> @incredibleCrayon shoot legs knife loop
[2:22:47] <SenketsuKira> you can just ignore them all
[2:22:48] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt there's a box on your right
[2:22:50] <%TheMattman1313> I mean it looks like they are only in about 4-5 spots
[2:22:52] <%K2YP70C0CK> it seems like the scope is on backwards
[2:22:54] <%natebud> Did Pat buy the mine thrower yet?
[2:22:55] <anAngryHamster> I brute forced it my first playthrough because I hoped so hard at turning off the freezer
[2:22:57] <$ItsRatman> you can cheese regeneradors by knifing them on the ground, they get stunlocked and cant do anything
[2:22:59] <%Dragovus> Why do they pay these monsters so much?
[2:22:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> @SoaringLettuce I think it's later ones
[2:23:00] <cureneckbeard> thermal scoop
[2:23:01] <+professormorrigan> Later on
[2:23:01] <%valkuma> Like i figured if you popped the nodes without using the rifle you could kill them with like 3 pistol shots
[2:23:05] <Scorian> its on normal LUL
[2:23:07] <kvassimoto> @SoaringLettuce some do
[2:23:07] <%thackattack00> That's just the spiky ones
[2:23:07] <%spongeofmystery> @SoaringLettuce come to think of it, me too. Had to knock some of them down
[2:23:07] <DuoScratch> Later ones have the ones on their backs.
[2:23:10] <%akumakins> The later ones have back parasites from what I remember
[2:23:10] <%Aydarkzero> maybe
[2:23:12] <%Mekhet09> No.
[2:23:12] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt so if you for some reason didnt buy a rifle at this point are you just screwed?
[2:23:13] <%Agami23> the iron maidens have them on their backs
[2:23:14] <%silverira> no
[2:23:14] <+professormorrigan> They come later
[2:23:14] <%happyface699> You can shoot off the legs and knife them @patstaresat
[2:23:14] <%linkster291> It's the later ones.
[2:23:15] <Magpiejake> no
[2:23:15] <TomFrank> its because youre playing coward mode
[2:23:16] <KeystoneA1> the first ones have it on the front only
[2:23:17] <heartlesshealer> progression
[2:23:19] <%akumakins> Or maybe its a difficulty thing
[2:23:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Iron maidens, and ones on Pro have ones on their back
[2:23:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, it's probably cuz these are the early ones
[2:23:19] <%BoomerUnchained> Later ones, yeah
[2:23:20] <%spongeofmystery> Spikey ones maybe
[2:23:20] <%Papa_Tak> pro I think
[2:23:21] <Magpiejake> thats pro
[2:23:23] <KeystoneA1> later ones have it front and back
[2:23:23] <%linkster291> The ones with the Needles.
[2:23:27] <%Renuarb> @PatStaresAt Only Iron Maiden one has a parasite on the back
[2:23:27] <+TheLastStar> first ones have in front only
[2:23:28] <%maskofmichael> Maybe your on easy mode?
[2:23:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> later ones have leeches on backs too
[2:23:29] <Shadope342> because that worked so well
[2:23:34] <mMayrro> shoot their legs and knife their ass
[2:23:39] <+professormorrigan> It's not professional only
[2:23:44] <%BioApple> why doesn't leon just take the scope off the rifle and look through it with the pistol psaLiz
[2:23:46] <sharpster78> youd be screwed, yea....dont forget the one with the keycard on it
[2:23:46] <Deadman_Reborn> magnum ammo in the hall
[2:23:48] <KeystoneA1> It just makes the Iron Maiden encounters dreadfully difficult
[2:23:48] <%Darren716> Oh man i forgot this dumb shit
[2:23:49] <heartlesshealer> progression-locked leeches
[2:23:49] <%SoaringLettuce> nope i used the bolt action on normal and i remember shooting all of these in the leg to get the backs
[2:23:49] <cureneckbeard> I like how they call the harder difficulty "pro", like here are professional RE4 players. Wait
[2:23:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> SourPls
[2:23:53] <%legendscar01> I love this soundtrack, its called infiltration
[2:23:56] <%Mekhet09> are we at the final knife fight?
[2:23:59] <%Kegeto> oh the crane game
[2:24:00] <Nightwing_B01> hits the ears real good

[3:32:42] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Umbrella still hasn't come back in a main role
[3:32:42] <j0ustar> Discount Metal Gear right there
[3:32:44] <%SoaringLettuce> KRAUSER, LIBERAL ICON
[3:32:44] <%ledgefiendd> this is so dumb
[3:32:46] <Deadman_Reborn> Krauser is a leftist liberal
[3:32:46] <Shadope342> is this the final stage of bernieism?
[3:32:46] <heartlesshealer> bye hat
[3:32:47] <%legendscar01> Krauser isn't a boomer conservative
[3:32:47] <MassConnect> bullets are tiny knives you shoot. change my mind
[3:32:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RESIDENT NONSENSE
[3:32:47] <a_mad_dragon> GOT HIS HAT
[3:32:48] <%Campfire_Chronicles> oh shit his hat
[3:32:48] <MSN04_Sazabi> Krauser is really upset impeachment went nowhere
[3:32:50] <%Aydarkzero> his hats off he's 100 times weaker now!
[3:32:50] <%tiaramaki> D: Lost his hat!
[3:32:50] <Nightwing_B01> it's boomer talk
[3:32:51] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt can you turn up the game's voices?
[3:32:52] <%happyface699> Liberal icon
[3:32:52] <UncleAndross_> nonsense... or CRAZY TALK
[3:32:52] <%13ry4n93> you knocked of his hat!
[3:32:53] <%Mister_McDerp> Krauser loves Bernie
[3:32:53] <%maskofmichael> Politics? In my Resident Evil? No thank you!
[3:32:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Krauser is Mitt Romney confrmed
[3:32:54] <CureMode666> suplex him
[3:32:56] <%Grayhammatter> you wouldn't download a knife car
[3:32:56] <%vectorless_peon> it means Krauser is ANTIFA
[3:32:59] <%valriot> Krauser for Bernie? PogChamp
[3:32:59] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[3:33:00] <Meekest> Krauser is TOO WOKE
[3:33:00] <%StaceMcGate> Just give him electric powers and he is Volgin
[3:33:01] <%RealThiele> wear his hat assert dominance
[3:33:02] <apolitenoob> ROSA PARKS, MARTIN LUTHER KING, KRAUSER
[3:33:06] <%jorniev> YOU SHOULD TRY FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU BELIVE IN SOME TIME LEON
[3:33:07] <%hermitsen> krauser would have impeached trump
[3:33:09] <%13ry4n93> Why is this metal gear boss in this game?
[3:33:09] <%Shady_Squid> Is this fight a metaphor for capitalism?
[3:33:10] <scrublordsamurai> leftist liberal is an oxymoron
[3:33:11] <%StaceMcGate> Krauser is Antifa confirmed
[3:33:12] <auraofdawn> i'd rather they just say "i wanna be king god of the world lol"
[3:33:13] <%toolofparanoia> KKRAUSER IS THE SOCIAIST HERO WE NEED!!!
[3:33:13] <Nightwing_B01> FeelsAmazingMan
[3:33:14] <%DukeMoose> oooh. Krauser is a libertarian
[3:33:15] <heartlesshealer> Krauser is saying that merely selling the monsters has failed
[3:33:15] <%spongeofmystery> Senator Armstrong keeps popping in places
[3:33:17] <Vohs_Bru> not even sold them
[3:33:18] <%Mekhet09> He means accept the parasite pat
[3:33:18] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt I'm pretty sure he means that Umbrella is old-fashioned and set in their ways
[3:33:19] <%Dr_Mooose> your just not woke enough to understand
[3:33:20] <GustauveVIII> make krauser retreat = summon a statue from the ground
[3:33:20] <Vohs_Bru> just made them
[3:33:21] <%legendscar01> They sold the viruses to the governments
[3:33:22] <%Aydarkzero> yeah a bit of this dialogue is sort of just said
[3:33:22] <DavidSanChan> RE branded monster energy drink
[3:33:22] <%DensityD> That's what we do best at NightMare Enterprises
[3:33:25] <%asgard147> BUT WE COULD CONTROL THE WORLD THO!
[3:33:26] <%jorniev> EVERYONE WILL BE FREE TO FIGHT THEIR OWN WAR LEON
[3:33:27] <%BoomerUnchained> Bombs? Nah, use monsters that usually kill you
[3:33:27] <%happyface699> Abraham Lincoln <<< KRAUSER
[3:33:30] <%DensityD> MONEYBACK GUARENTEE
[3:33:31] <Vitriolic3s> law alignment is bad
[3:33:31] <smallboops> im suddenly aware of all the arian men talking about the ultimate future of man
[3:33:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> To be fair after umbrella fell there has been an increase in Bioterrorism
[3:33:37] <%SpookyTrevor> the dialogue is amazing
[3:33:37] <%SoaringLettuce> HOW DID KRAUSER NOT BECOME A MEME AFTER THAT?
[3:33:38] <Nightwing_B01> whaaaat
[3:33:39] <%pocketcircuitfighter> The C-Virus from the Wuhan Mountains
[3:33:40] <alliudmla> You say?

[3:33:44] <%Darren716> Ya think?
[3:33:45] <lloyddboy> UNDER MY NEW WORLD THEY WILL MAKE MONSTER WAIFUS INSTEAD OF THESE GROSS SHITTY REGULAR MONSTERS
[3:33:45] <%tigerfang86> NO, REALLY
[3:33:47] <%Pharmakokinetic> PRECISELY
[3:33:48] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Accept our new parasite savors pat
[3:33:48] <%SpookyTrevor> this game has a story???
[3:33:48] <Finakala> Have you played Shinji Mikami's games?
[3:33:49] <SomersaultJustice> like platinum
[3:33:49] <%natebud> whatever gave you that idea?
[3:33:50] <%happyface699> @soaringlettuce Wasn’t topical
[3:33:50] <%hntronium> fair
[3:33:51] <%pectusumbra> I mean I understand. It's basically supposed to be 'a person stuck in the status quo can't change it' And most likely Krasuer is on board with Wesker's COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[3:33:51] <smallboops> im not saying its nazis but its nazis
[3:33:51] <%RealThiele> japan man doesnt understand context?
[3:33:52] <j0ustar> VERY correct
[3:33:53] <@commanderclaw> Is that why Evil Within 2 is better than 1?
[3:33:56] <Vohs_Bru> like MR. Hideo?
[3:33:56] <Treuan> So I guess Shinji just wanted to get in a robot?
[3:33:58] <%Valdorick> Art dum
[3:34:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> artdum
[3:34:00] <%13ry4n93> I am smrt!
[3:34:02] <circular7> and you'd be right
[3:34:03] <%PanicSwytch> So Umbrella are Democrats
[3:34:05] <%Mister_McDerp> liberals love the plagas
[3:34:05] <%damienlunas> art man bad
[3:34:06] <Strider222> mr healthy
[3:34:07] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Was Krauser mentioned before this game?
[3:34:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HIDEO IS A GENIUS
[3:34:13] <CureMode666> turn ssj 3
[3:34:14] <%jorniev> KRAUSER IS JUST LIKE ARMSTRONG
[3:34:17] <Nightwing_B01> FeelsGoodMan
[3:34:19] <circular7> "who care as long as it's cool"
[3:34:19] <%MajorCrasher> the evil within is proof he gives no fucks about the story
[3:34:21] <%Aydarkzero> Evil Witin 2 looks fun actually
[3:34:23] <%RealThiele> they got told what was shit and fixed a lot of it
[3:34:24] <%natebud> We made it up
[3:34:25] <corepercentlives> Yes
[3:34:26] <%Nina96> @PatStaresAt is evil within 1 still worth playing?
[3:34:26] <andiwaffles> Pat does it make you sad that Demon's Souls is slowly entering the abyss of the oblivion in which all forgotten games exist?
[3:34:28] <%Dr_Mooose> born too die
[3:34:28] <heartlesshealer> that JoJo villain in Evil Within 2
[3:34:29] <%Helmed> evil within 1 had that sick coat in the intro though
[3:34:31] <j0ustar> Krauser is just here
[3:34:32] <mMayrro> I mean he was but nobody cares
[3:34:32] <%LunarRemix> He did work with Suda51 to make Killer7 and the prototype version of Shadows of the Damned, he cares about story, if only to let someone else handle it.
[3:34:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ok boomer
[3:34:35] <%Agami23> he has a prequel backstory in darkside Chronicles
[3:34:35] <%Dr_Mooose> *to
[3:34:38] <%Delenay> does leon even know who wesker is or is that letter just for the player
[3:34:38] <Vitriolic3s> was Krauser mentioned after this game tho
[3:34:38] <%happyface699> I knew artists who used subtext they were cowards
[3:34:38] <%13ry4n93> I feel like his betrayal would've matter more if he had been
[3:34:39] <%damienlunas> why does krauser have exploding robot drones
[3:34:41] <%Zerodyne90> 1 was much more interesting to watch
[3:34:43] <+keatiestofthegribbles> pat using the tmp tf?
[3:34:43] <CureMode666> evil within was a good game, but story was meh
[3:34:44] <King_thunder365> @natebud "This one was invented by a writer"
[3:34:45] <%bluebiscuit94> Pat is art, art is dum, so Pat is dum
[3:34:48] <%pocketcircuitfighter> Stephano was fucking sick in Evil Within 2
[3:34:51] <+professormorrigan> TEW2 was fun
[3:34:59] <%RealThiele> where does he hide all this equipment
[3:35:00] <Daxalog> Why are their decepticons?
[3:35:02] <%happyface699> @pocketcircuitfighter Yep

[3:35:05] <%valriot> Plus it's fuckin terrible
[3:35:07] <%Aydarkzero> yeah it's a little weird
[3:35:07] <mMayrro> isn't krauser in the shitty gaeboy game?
[3:35:08] <%davimotion96> Krauser always felt like a Metal Gear Boss to me
[3:35:09] <heartlesshealer> just beepy robots
[3:35:10] <%SpookyTrevor> I'm actually watching the evil within 2 play on YouTube currently

[3:37:15] <%SoFarFetched> Krauser Name Meaning. German and Jewish (Ashkenazic): nickname for someone with curly hair, from a derivative of Middle High German krus 'curly', 'crinkly', German kraus.
[3:37:16] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> was he EVER really a good person?

[3:37:28] <+necrocannibal2> did anyone else rehearse the Krauser scenes with their friends in high school?
[3:37:29] <%SoFarFetched> KRAUSER DOES NOT HAVE CURLY HAIR
[3:37:29] <%shurtal> The name Krauser is derived from the Uppper German word Kraus, meaning curly @PatStaresAt
[3:37:31] <%damienlunas> Krauser is just german for fucking CURLY.

[4:13:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Some areas
[4:13:36] <Alexisonfires> So I never understood RE bosses, after transforming and killing the protagonist, do they just stay in their mutated form and carry on with their lives normally or what? Imagine trying to do your faxes as a four legged eyeball monster Squid1 rooD1 rooD2 Squid4
[4:13:37] <Heyestus> Do you ever see a PC in RE4?
[4:13:39] <%NovaKnightmare> but did the Internet have spain?
[4:13:40] <%LunarRemix> He did a Soul level 1 run of Raccon City without a walkthrough
[4:13:41] <%king_wragles> intel gathering existed before Google was a startup
[4:13:41] <%TONYOO101> does that castle look like it as dial up @PatStaresAt
[4:13:42] <%13ry4n93> Probably the specifics were classified

[4:13:47] <omen_setter> Spain has not advanced technologically since Don Quixote
[4:13:49] <shamchimp> Not medievil fucking villages and castles

[4:13:55] <FeralRageGaming> i feel like everything on raccoon city would have been covered up, besides being an outbreak by umbrella

[4:13:57] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd pushing up

[4:13:59] <Deadman_Reborn> yeah but the 56k type internet
[4:14:02] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt Umbrella's main headquarters is in europe
[4:14:05] <%13ry4n93> Like it might say he survived raccon city but not go into super detail about the shit he faced
[4:14:06] <+BringBackSempai> they have Sat internet
[4:14:07] <StarlitStunner> stripSmug
[4:14:11] <+Kriptin> One of the notes the first time in the village has pictures of Leon with "WATCH OUT FOR THE AMERICAN AGENT"
[4:14:11] <+코코꾸라> Chat we had DSL, come on
[4:14:11] <%AdmiralButtloaf> Saddler seems like a city boy with money and charisma
[4:14:13] <$floralkami> SOMEBODY.......
[4:14:15] <Hellarussian> EYE wonder
[4:14:18] <%BoomerUnchained> It would have taken them months to load the picture
[4:14:18] <%13ry4n93> @BringBackSempai they have kangroo internet?
[4:14:26] <%king_wragles> @Sartastic That's fair. It's also fair that Los Illuminatos had a ton of money and imported a lot of materials to build their base.

[4:27:30] <fairore> he doesn't haft to do it imo
[4:27:34] <raven_frame> I think that was a totally inappropriate advance on Ashley's part, Leon should put in for sexual harassment in the work place.
[4:27:41] <%joylent_blue> Seyyen yeah but he's also doing Ada's stuff
[4:27:49] <+Seyyen> rad
[4:28:17] <%joylent_blue> probably not today tho

[4:30:42] <+necrocannibal2> twitter sucks
[4:30:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ledaxel I love that game gimme your Steam
[4:30:54] <Meekest> An app?
[4:30:54] <%Aydarkzero> that would be great
[4:30:55] <%Shadicara> Like a text
[4:30:55] <%juxtest> You're a madman
[4:30:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just text me
[4:31:00] <%Lizard0TM> Alomost as if Twitch itself should do that
[4:31:00] <trianglehat> that'd be nice
[4:31:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that would be neato
[4:31:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Twitch notifications are close.
[4:31:03] <thetruthofyourbeing> So you wish to be god
[4:31:03] <%SirGO0SE> group text?
[4:31:03] <%Grayhammatter> that would be awesome
[4:31:03] <%j0ustar> I mean.... the twitch app?
[4:31:06] <%mh9s> hit the streamer button
[4:31:06] <Marpolo13> you could personally call all your viewers to tell us
[4:31:07] <%SMuffinMan> That'd be rad
[4:31:07] <%Mister_McDerp> a text message would be good
[4:31:09] <%miguelrod777> MADNESS
[4:31:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> I get notifications on my phone app.
[4:31:11] <%damienlunas> The reason I sub is literally beacause the discord is the most reliable notification method
[4:31:13] <%BoomerUnchained> Well, twitch mails me, so that works
[4:31:13] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt just get all of your subscribers' numbers and text them! /s
[4:31:16] <raven_frame> Shouldn't we just get Twitch notifications for that?
[4:31:17] <%chhdez> I recently started to get notifications for the stream, but just yesterday
[4:31:18] <GiygasDrillBreak> Twitch Now does that
[4:31:19] <cureneckbeard> Just announce a schedule ahead of time
[4:31:21] <%SoFarFetched> I do twitter for that when you and PAige announce on twitter.
[4:31:22] <+budyd> nah fam
[4:31:22] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @PatStaresAt CHECK TWITTER DMS I made you something
[4:31:25] <%rytisone> just scream outta window that you're live
[4:31:27] <+Ledaxel> @BallerSwagBro9k i dont have the game on steam but ledaxel
[4:31:32] <DavidSanChan> "schedule"
[4:31:34] <Animorphimagi> Twitch does that.
[4:31:36] <%Lizard0TM> I wanna point out, I have notifications ON for Pat, but I NEVER get notified by Twitch
[4:31:42] <%AdmiralButtloaf> do psa at begining and end of stream to opt in for notifications
[4:31:44] <%joylent_blue> we like PREDICTABILITY
[4:31:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thanks for the LuvHearts @cvp5127
[4:31:53] <raven_frame> Ah Twitch sucks, I see.
[4:31:58] <%Psyramics> We like knowing in advance when to show up
[4:31:58] <%zionamaze1> zionamaze1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! yay stream baby
[4:31:58] <%marsantas> Twitch has NEVER told me you are streaming
[4:32:00] <thetruthofyourbeing> I had to disable twitch notifications because they were popping several times a day. the seem quite reliable
[4:32:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually DO get notifications from Twitch when Pat gets on.
[4:32:02] <+Walopoh> people tend to like to expect things
[4:32:04] <%valkuma> @PatStaresAt Kripparian the hearthstone/diablo streamer did a huge video about how important consistency is
[4:32:06] <%tiaramaki> Share that case!
[4:32:08] <%j0ustar> The ONLY reason I know you're live is thanks to the twitch app tho
