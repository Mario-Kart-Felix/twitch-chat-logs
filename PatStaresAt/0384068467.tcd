[0:02:23] <Vex_Machina> If you type"+twitch_prime_linked 1" in your launch options in Apex Legends, you will get 5 free lootboxes and a legendary pathfinder skin
[0:02:24] <%SaltyDongs> WHO'S TALKING

[0:02:31] <Shotgun_Steve> bunkus is bupkis
[0:02:31] <CptVolkow> team 3am, what we watching.
[0:02:37] <drinkmoxie> Pat how is the gout?
[0:02:38] <%korth367> wat
[0:02:38] <Aphex_0> Holy shit Pat isn't dead from the RED BULL (TM) POISON
[0:02:42] <Solidus_113> i'm installing Metro Exodus right now
[0:02:45] <~AngriestPat> its good drink
[0:02:45] <kaylakale> hey everyone :)
[0:02:45] <%Keeble24> its 5 pm here down in NA
[0:02:52] <~AngriestPat> Managed by not drinking alcohol and not eating too much red meat
[0:02:55] <MarylandJutsu> pat drink good redbull
[0:02:58] <%ElenaManetta> i almost ate cat treats because i thought it was food
[0:02:59] <drinkmoxie> Good to hear
[0:03:01] <~AngriestPat> I got lucky in that I have baby gout
[0:03:02] <%ElenaManetta> it's in a bright red bad
[0:03:02] <KommandantRaphael > is beer better or worse for you than redbull
[0:03:03] <%ElenaManetta> bag, even
[0:03:04] <RollCritFail> Pretty sure Pat's blood is already at least 80% Red Bull by now anyway
[0:03:06] <Solidus_113> Remember that Devolver Lootbox coin? it's 15 cents on the store RIGHT NOW
[0:03:07] <%ElenaManetta> like the kind of bag you stick candy in
[0:03:07] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> “It’s good drink” pat says as his insides melt
[0:03:08] <%SaltyDongs> Shill harder then that Pat
[0:03:15] <~AngriestPat> Anything with alcohol might as well be a knife to the shins with gout
[0:03:17] <$BunkusFreskie> Butt Gout
[0:03:18] <%laserbeaming> You should mod The Blood in Darkest Dungeon to be Red Bull
[0:03:19] <lloyddboy> @Solidus_113 OH FUCK
[0:03:20] <%AncelDeLambert> wattup, fools?
[0:03:21] <timetraveller2000> Patrolling the Mojave makes me wish for a nuclear winter.
[0:03:21] <dekkitout> Could be worse, diabetes is a hell of a drug
[0:03:27] <+SpamKingRathalos> I'm here and my body is ready for the Mojave.
[0:03:32] <+serpentk1ng> !uptime
[0:03:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3m 34s.
[0:03:33] <helpmeimafruit> i mix red bull with sardine juice and vodka and its pretty great
[0:03:33] <Shotgun_Steve> now that he said its good, he cant enjoy it anymore
[0:03:34] <$LocDogX86X> Heyooo Everyone !! mousieSal
[0:03:37] <CptVolkow> fuck 4a and epic for their Exodus fuckery
[0:03:39] <KommandantRaphael > at least pat isnt a leper
[0:03:41] <%snow_bush> Ugh...Time to see if I survive this!
[0:03:42] <+kitkatcake> Hey Pat i'd just like to say thank you, yours and Paige's entertaining content is helping me through some tough times
[0:03:42] <%Typhaeon> Clearly the solution to the plague of alcoholism is to just give all drunks gout
[0:03:43] <KommandantRaphael > yet
[0:03:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat ouch, i got told gout runs in my family and i gotta get blood tests done to see if i have it
[0:03:49] <Scarnehu> live with Pat! it's wag-a-bag wednesday!
[0:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Oh, Pat CAN'T drink alcohol?
[0:03:53] <$cureneckbeard> Paige loves Skelmo because skeletons can't get gout
[0:03:56] <%AncelDeLambert> I thought he just didn't like it
[0:03:58] <DirtyPopcornJ> Some Delicious Sugar-Free RedBull (Tm) will cure that
[0:03:58] <%valachi> What if we just stab people that drink beer in the shins instead?
[0:04:01] <%Keeble24> You still in your undies?
[0:04:03] <exalt4747> You guys ready for New Ace Evil blood 72?
[0:04:09] <awooliehunterisneveralone> got a buddy with gout who drinks some vinegar stuff everyday and then drinks beer
[0:04:10] <%valachi> Like with a pen or something
[0:04:19] <awooliehunterisneveralone> supposedly it helps
[0:04:22] <wydamn> Fun fact; My great uncle who worked construction had gout. He also had a passion for mussels. So his wife would make mussels for him for supper when he asked, but only on the nights were he didn't work the next morning.

[0:14:17] <%ElenaManetta> It totally is a thing, but for some reason people view it as a negative trait when they don't realize white people can handle super duper sweet things in exchange
[0:14:18] <%connos_livereview> ddude nice

[0:21:29] <King_Krimzon> 76 is untouchable.
[0:21:29] <Sloavon> a decade
[0:21:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aa while
[0:21:30] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout 76 isn't a game. I think it's like. A scam for a tax write off.
[0:21:31] <%kiiiirsten> I can't believe how hard Bethesda kicked its own ass
[0:21:32] <DirtyPopcornJ> The throne is theirs.
[0:21:33] <televisedrevolt> Just had a sick crying session. Resolved a bunch of emotional issues.
[0:21:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat people who are actually trilingual are honestly really cool and have my big respect

[0:21:36] <OwlLightningMage> 76 is the worst is has ever been LUL
[0:21:36] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat Elder scrolls 6 will beat fall out 76
[0:21:36] <%AncelDeLambert> it will wear its crown at LEAST that long
[0:21:37] <Breakend28> Fallout 76 is the king shit!!
[0:21:37] <+DK_Rance> 76 is unstoppable
[0:21:39] <MaxonMashville> Fallout 78 is a meme ay this point
[0:21:39] <Darren716> To me it seems that Anthem is just very meh
[0:21:39] <%Harawanagangsta> FO76 is still fucking up
[0:21:40] <%nofestu2> apatCrazyhead
[0:21:40] <+d00msdaydan> tbh after today's patch i think anthem is encroaching on fo76 territory

[0:21:42] <%dmdyne99> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[0:21:43] <%ElenaManetta> Or maybe it's a money laundering scheme
[0:21:44] <%connos_livereview> not hilarious shit
[0:21:44] <%Gray_skies1993> no, 76 is legitimately a crisis for Bethesda
[0:21:45] <exalt4747> Guessing you all heard about how they banned the guy that WAS liking fallout 76?
[0:21:47] <timetraveller2000> Nothing can beat 76’s awfulness. That’s it’s edging feature.
[0:21:47] <%KillScottKill> say Death Stranding
[0:21:49] <Prevot> that scam kickstarter game
[0:21:50] <fluqqer3d> SeemsGood
[0:21:51] <stabbityrabbit> No, there's actually something salvageable way under everything. 76 is terrible all the way down.
[0:21:51] <dekkitout> Fallout 76 sank any residual trust in Bethesda
[0:21:52] <alexandrecau> I mean when the country change rules to make your game illegal
[0:21:53] <3xgilly> 76 just banned the only 900 hour player for having too much ammo
[0:21:53] <DirtyPopcornJ> Had fun playing our game??? B A N N E D
[0:21:53] <SilentClyde> If something beats 76 we're gonna feel it physically. Anthem isn't that, but it's pretty bad.
[0:21:56] <gustavozxd> the only way to be worse than f76 is if someone DIES
[0:21:56] <%Das_Bass> play 900 hours and get banned lol

[0:22:35] <%crimsonharvest> if it comes out at all first, that's a miracle
[0:22:35] <roburabu> great, the one game my fallout76 loving friend looks forward to the most
[0:22:36] <DirtyPopcornJ> That game is an.... E V E N T U A L L Y
[0:22:37] <MaxonMashville> it won't come out
[0:22:41] <Caidezes> Star Citizen is never coming out, Pat.
[0:22:41] <TheBlankAce> You imagine it will come outat all?
[0:22:42] <%laserbeaming> Star Citizen is shaping up to be a disaster
[0:22:42] <Ion_LaserX> That "game" is either a ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme
[0:22:44] <dekkitout> Speaking of Star Citizen, I was told of how a ship worth a million USD was destroyed over a waifu war or some shit
[0:22:44] <+Bluemanzee> Star Citizen is vaporware
[0:22:44] <corepercentlives> people will die
[0:22:44] <lionmanguy> is chat empty or not just loading for me
[0:22:44] <%joylent_blue> it'll never come out
[0:22:45] <Sloavon> that's bethesda too?
[0:22:45] <+LavenderLaser> star citizen flopping could actually have a major ripple effect on the entire industry
[0:22:45] <strongweeb> but my $500 ship
[0:22:47] <kalinflip> What hapenned
[0:22:48] <%connos_livereview> IF IT COMES out
[0:22:48] <Finakala> Elder Scrolls VI might well do it
[0:22:48] <Breakend28> Bethesda has turned to trash fire
[0:22:50] <exalt4747> I've not heard of star citizen
[0:22:52] <%valachi> @AngriestPat Hey Pat you hear about how some players have put in like 200k by themselves?
[0:22:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> Scam Citizens
[0:22:52] <%ace_cfa44> THEY HAVE
[0:22:53] <thelonechris> Star Citizen's Arrest
[0:22:53] <+LavenderLaser> all that money just fallout out the bottom
[0:22:53] <%Gogogolem> al@
[0:22:53] <%ElenaManetta> The one Homestuck game where they robbed the guy of like 2 mil is pretty bad
[0:22:54] <%AlopekisPup> @Fatman2124 Nah. Everyone else is speaking wrong.
[0:22:54] <%Shillk> $500 is the poverty ships @strongweeb
[0:22:55] <%ElenaManetta> For a Kickstarter
[0:22:56] <%Tokanova> people have spent tens of thousands of dollars on star citizen
[0:22:56] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Problem is it has to come out though
[0:22:56] <%AbnormalVoid> 🦀 Star Citizen is never coming out 🦀
[0:22:57] <corepool> what star citizen
[0:22:58] <$cureneckbeard> Gamers rise up!
[0:22:59] <wydamn> I fully expect Star Citizen's CEO to become declared dead while opening an orphanage in India and the body was mysteriously not found.
[0:23:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wa hapun
[0:23:01] <SilentClyde> Doesn't Star Citizen already have a $27k DLC pack?
[0:23:01] <GeneralHysterics> I’m convinced that game can’t exist
[0:23:02] <%Das_Bass> $2500 ship
[0:23:02] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Bethesda was always a trash fire
[0:23:02] <%gunplagoat> hey pat bitch ricky here, just wanna say I recently got promoted at my job, thanks for helping me keep my sanity over the years
[0:23:04] <%GohanEgret> @AngriestPat dont forget Kingdom of Amalur
[0:23:06] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat We'll remember it as the star citizen riots.
[0:23:07] <suikudo> They are well over millions
[0:23:08] <OwlLightningMage> Star Citizen is charging people 100s of thousands LUL
[0:23:10] <Latch77> star citizen is not a game is just a scam LUL
[0:23:11] <+AndeOneNine> 27000$ ship pack.
[0:23:15] <Finakala> Amalur was actually a fun game
[0:23:16] <Fatman2124> @alopekispup lol
[0:23:18] <$RubberFistFight> the best part is you pay all that money for something you can't even use, that isn't even in a game that hasn't even been released yet.
[0:23:19] <RollCritFail> "We ran out of money for the 9th time can you believe i-anyway give us more money" LUL
[0:23:20] <%dave323dave> it's okay...
[0:23:22] <$RubberFistFight> it's fucking insane.
[0:23:24] <haitakaa> Kurt Schilling my man
[0:23:25] <suikudo> My history teacher played that game
[0:23:25] <OwlLightningMage> It's okay
[0:23:26] <%PlainSimpleTailor> meh
[0:23:30] <%valachi> @SilentClyde Yeah, you also have to pay 1000 bucks on top of that to see fucking jpegs of ships
[0:23:30] <%Gray_skies1993> it's decent, ye
[0:23:31] <%captainthunderwolf> It's a good game that goes on for a WHILE.
[0:23:33] <+manwithboxonhead> It will change the industry
[0:23:33] <%walnutcast> a cool out of YES
[0:23:34] <Tucker0603> it's a good fuuking game
[0:23:36] <%lessclams> kingdom's of amalur is pretty good for a while
[0:23:36] <%Typhaeon> steakRIP that studio
[0:23:37] <KeiPrime> more like a high 6
[0:23:37] <%GohanEgret> I mean the background stuff about devlopment/taxes
[0:23:38] <Agent_Sampson> Same
[0:23:38] <dashmatt> it served its purpose lol
[0:23:39] <$philoboy123> It plays good but everything around it is boring
[0:23:40] <%Shadowthedigger> 1
[0:23:40] <exalt4747> Amalur was pretty good from what played.
[0:23:41] <$LocDogX86X> Thats fair
[0:23:41] <Mrchiselfist> 7. literally unplayable
[0:23:42] <%segonian> Buying a ship in Star Citizen is like buying a boat, but instead of having to dump money into it, you just cant use it.
[0:23:44] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, it's a solid 7 for me
[0:23:44] <OwlLightningMage> It's not as good as it needed to be
[0:23:45] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat have you played metro yet?
[0:23:46] <bluebiscuit94> It's okay, it's surrounded by unfortunate cirmcumtstances
[0:23:46] <$MightyMaxT> This is the first I've heard of Star Citizen.
[0:23:46] <%laserbeaming> I like Kingdom's of Amalur, I'm glad it doesn't belong to Rhode Island anymore
[0:23:47] <%segbas2004> HI PAT! :3
[0:23:47] <haitakaa> he's the guy with the bloody socks Kappa
[0:23:48] <%Typhaeon> You're not wrong
[0:23:49] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat PAT! Good evening!
[0:23:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I love looking mostly at the FLOOR in that game
[0:23:51] <%LogothX> Woah! Das a basebaal
[0:23:54] <%AncelDeLambert> whoL
[0:23:58] <%joylent_blue> he is in general, but that too
[0:23:59] <$RubberFistFight> you would literally get more use out of BURNING YOUR MONEY than throwing it at Star Citizen, because at least by burning it you'd produce warmth.
[0:23:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> who?
[0:23:59] <RamblinEvilRyan> do tell
[0:24:00] <%AncelDeLambert> *who?
[0:24:02] <ScreamingMeat> KoA is really fucking cool. I'm glad THQNordic has plans for it
[0:24:07] <%Scarnehu> Hey, twitch and discord are linked but the discord still isn't showing up. Ideas?
[0:24:09] <lionmanguy> Oh there we go had to restart it
[0:24:09] <timetraveller2000> Don’t mind me, just lurking in chat :)
[0:24:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> Who we talking about

[0:24:18] <captainshtbox> oppsie
[0:24:18] <Shotgun_Steve> didnt that game nearly bankrupt the state of rhode island?
[0:24:18] <%walnutcast> it's just office pranks u dummy

[0:24:26] <Darren716> Oh god that
[0:24:29] <fluqqer3d> just a prank bro
[0:24:30] <RipSlamsteak> how do you spell that?
[0:24:32] <%ace_cfa44> @angriestpat a man in the Pacific Northwest sued star citizen for not fulfilling their release schedule and won the suit, setting the precedent for other funders to sue for a refund
[0:24:35] <%GohanEgret> remember how it was supposed to fund an MMO
[0:24:36] <GoopyAvacado> are you still working out?
[0:24:36] <%walnutcast> he is a human made of baseballs
[0:24:41] <%AlopekisPup> Sue the fuck out of him then.
[0:24:42] <%rdark_ksu> amalur? Like old Camelot and shit?
[0:24:42] <%captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Flaming bills might have a unique scent to them, but all a Star Citizen ship smells like is delusion and the hope for a better outcome.

[0:28:02] <$Mighty_observer> RedBull still taste like day old piss
[0:28:02] <SilentClyde> It's not a question of if that's possible, it's a matter of whether or not your dick can handle it.
[0:28:04] <%sleepy_coffee> i mean no one's stopping you Pat, but i would strongly advice not to do the penal syringing
[0:28:05] <$RubberFistFight> @Rhinoprotoss I knew someone who insisted on putting sugar in green tea. Yeah, we haven't spoken in years now.

[0:29:25] <%crimsonharvest> my butt always gives a little screm when i poop
[0:29:28] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the problem is that retail generally breaks you so bad you avoid getting back into the ratrace, and not everyone can get as many twitchbux as you :P
[0:29:29] <$cureneckbeard> out of your butt nyannAngry
[0:29:31] <%valachi> Whetstones and pick/nets are barely a concern in the older games.

[0:30:16] <+manwithboxonhead> Temp work has been a good key to leaving retail. My place wasn’t bad, it was boring my soul away.
[0:30:16] <%Gray_skies1993> @dmdyne99 I believe he did
[0:30:20] <$RubberFistFight> @dave323dave I'm pretty sure he mentioned on a podcast how useless that degree is and how much he regrets wasting his time with it.

[0:30:52] <+Bluemanzee> Retail is where happiness goes to die
[0:30:52] <%SuttonOMEGA> ?
[0:30:52] <$RubberFistFight> @manwithboxonhead so you can replace the anxiety of being constantly shit on by your peers, with the anxiety of not knowing how long your temporary job is going to last and thus being unable to actually plan for anything.

[0:41:38] <natebud> pat i don't mean to talk bad about your mod but...
[0:41:38] <RollCritFail> 1% Pat
[0:41:39] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> He said 76. He said it!
[0:41:39] <aimlesshealer> Pat owns a majority stake in the universe
[0:41:42] <Clyderso> [ZA KING]
[0:41:43] <StromkoPenguin> He's got pockets that jingle jangle (with 76,000 bottlecaps)
[0:41:43] <dashmatt> post apocalyptic tourist
[0:41:44] <stealthfart> What kinda mods did Pat put in this game? I thought the king looked a little closer to Elvis, in this engine at least, the first time i played?
[0:41:44] <3xgilly> nooooooooo
[0:41:46] <%rdark_ksu> becoming as wealthy as possible was always my thing in games like this
[0:41:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 76!!!!!
[0:41:47] <dekkitout> "Is this your King?"
[0:41:47] <Latch77> @AngriestPat are you gonna play metro exodus? it was pretty good
[0:41:47] <%lewdskeletor13> EAT THE PAT
[0:41:50] <$cureneckbeard> He just coincidentally sounds like Elvis
[0:41:51] <%Gray_skies1993> @galaxyswirl he's imitating him, yes
[0:41:54] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Shit talking the King is a bannable offense
[0:42:01] <%FracturedImage> he has brain damage thats why
[0:42:01] <natebud> He used to look like Elvis too, until this mod
[0:42:01] <%connos_livereview> your a little bitch and your brother was too
[0:42:03] <nobknee> He's called The King, also. Kappa

[0:42:14] <Sloavon> so basically it's just a coincidence?
[0:42:15] <%ooblagis> They also thought it was some kind of shrine, not a stupid Vegas thing
[0:42:16] <%Das_Bass> its Vegas thats why

[0:44:17] <+AndeOneNine> Merely time.
[0:44:18] <callsigneagle01> I feel like I've asked this before but what made New Vegas so much better than FO 3 or 4? Not that I don't like it it's just something I can't put a finger on it. I don't think it's just cause of Obsidian; I liked the western thing but I figured that was just me.
[0:44:20] <%weissguard> POLYDEUCES! Kappa
[0:44:30] <Senselessvirus> @angriestpat isn't there a separate option for radio music in the audio settings to get rid of the problem?

[0:45:34] <%lewdskeletor13> We got Thai food we’re not even allowed to sell people!
[0:45:37] <%ElenaManetta> Are you allowed to shoot the children in this game, or is this one of those "uh oh the bullets don't work suddenly" games
[0:45:37] <arkv01> you know they could save fallout 76 by just converting the entire game to new vegas 2
[0:45:38] <+bonzosan> mojave, more like, mokajiko
[0:45:41] <hauntingstarfish> wrangle some ASS

[0:45:44] <Finakala> Better colour palette too honestly
[0:45:45] <stealthfart> @callsigneagle01 I’ve always thought it was because it was the obvious things people always mention, but also because it’s your personal story and not a family retrieval story like 3 and 4 were. Artificial caring is what i refer to it as
[0:45:51] <%connos_livereview> youre actually supposed to do this quest on arrival
[0:45:51] <%SaltyDongs> Coward
[0:45:52] <Sloavon> he said no detours

[0:46:17] <$cureneckbeard> Gotta cheat
[0:46:17] <kingra> JUST PRETENDING
[0:46:18] <Conky89> Plus it New Vegas vanilla has improved gameplay mechanics such as aiming down sites, less overpowered main characters (perks every 2 levels), etc.
[0:46:18] <TikanZK> HOW DOES HE DO IT
[0:46:20] <TheHairiestHare> @callsigneagle01 I think it just looks better, honestly.

[1:12:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten how dare u
[1:12:53] <Fujiwara_92> THE CHURCH OF THE KING Kreygasm
[1:12:54] <Parapattern> I find it VERY hard to believe there wouldn't be any mention of his name
[1:12:56] <PSI_Guy95> I dress up as Jesus on Sunday every week
[1:12:57] <%mayorrev> i wish elvis was jesus too
[1:13:01] <%connos_livereview> his name was john travolta
[1:13:01] <+JackMillerTime> he was a blackbelt in kenpo
[1:13:04] <fighterman> how did he get the accent?
[1:13:05] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars I said what I said!
[1:13:07] <xtremegamer80> So that's where those Elvis impersonators learned
[1:13:07] <%ElenaManetta> Now we don't need impersonators, we just use holograms. THE FUTURE!!!

[1:13:57] <ComradeConquistador> Technically, everyone dies taking a shit.
[1:13:58] <Parapattern> i.e. couldn't get the rights to any Elvis songs
[1:13:59] <%mayorrev> eww
[1:14:06] <%Das_Bass> they couldn't afford his songs for the game

[1:14:08] <%D_day> aka they didn't get the song rights Kappa
[1:14:10] <$RubberFistFight> Fun fact: by the end of his life, Elvis was eating hollowed-out bread loaves/rolls stuffed with peanut butter and bacon.
[1:14:11] <%Gray_skies1993> I'd like to point out that I guarantee no one in 2281 has the knowledge of how Elvis died

[1:26:10] <captainshtbox> dont be a dirtbag, got it
[1:26:15] <Conky89> Hopefully Obsidian will get to make the game they truly wanted to make with the Outer Worlds. This game did not quite reach its full potential (Caeser's Legion being under developed for example)
[1:26:15] <Nighthawkmun> AGH MY SPINE
[1:26:17] <%Gray_skies1993> Marcus has a BUNCH of honor

[1:30:10] <MarylandJutsu> The...ELMO
[1:30:12] <%Gray_skies1993> JOHN CASSIDY
[1:30:12] <commonvermin> One of the coolest things in Crusader Kings II is your character earning titles for certain things
[1:30:14] <CrabSlacks> he was a bad one
[1:30:16] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> I always liked telling ppl I was a Witcher as Geralt, idk why it felt like a rare and weird flex TehePelo
[1:30:21] <Kingtut9009> Marcus wasn't just a companion Pat, he was the best companion, next to Cassidy
[1:30:25] <%kiiiirsten> I was debating whether or not I'd let Marcus smash but then I remembered he's a ken doll
[1:30:28] <commonvermin> I was once "King Harold the Cleansing Flame"
[1:30:29] <Gruhunchously> I like to headcannon that Cass' mom is the female Chosen One.
[1:30:32] <SubjectX07x> @bars_l I probably forgot a lot of in between quests in that main storyline.
[1:30:32] <hauntingstarfish> kaiser roll
[1:30:36] <JoeNeutrino> Being crucified does tend to change people.
[1:30:38] <%bars_l> its the first quest
[1:30:44] <SubjectX07x> It's not though?
[1:30:44] <Sloavon> why?
[1:30:45] <%Gray_skies1993> @Gruhunchously that's not bad actually
[1:30:47] <dekkitout> Really? Carnage? Really?
[1:30:51] <+manwithboxonhead> I thought it would fall apart overnight
[1:30:52] <%crimsonharvest> are you serious Pat
[1:30:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> ....or Butch Cassidy
[1:30:53] <%connos_livereview> id fuck rose of sharon cassidy seed of john cassidy would you chat ?
[1:30:55] <dekkitout> Carnage is cool now, but really?
[1:30:56] <+ahegotrigger> yeah nobody in Caesars legion are even close to being as well read as Caesar
[1:30:57] <%crimsonharvest> Butch Cassidy you nerd
[1:30:57] <%TheSpiritof2277> John has a line about comic books in FO2, but idk about Carnage
[1:30:57] <%Das_Bass> and the Crimson Caravan are in FO1
[1:30:58] <%PlainSimpleTailor> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatHoldon
[1:30:58] <commonvermin> it's implied that one of the characters in the game is the Tribals son!
[1:30:58] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, he says that his parents named him after an old world comic book character.
[1:30:58] <hauntingstarfish> thats a stretch
[1:31:00] <+JackMillerTime> aw i has hoping the grateful dead song
[1:31:01] <captainshtbox> we can't expect god to do all the work
[1:31:02] <%bars_l> tutorial > jauffre > kvatch

[1:31:17] <+aslfrasle> Carnage's name is spelled different though.
[1:31:23] <$Tuskor13> @bars_l whats your point
[1:31:26] <+aslfrasle> He's Cletus Kasady.
[1:31:28] <%rdark_ksu> Also Cass hating chems is a call back to Cass from 2
[1:31:32] <%Prism_Wing> Cassidy from Preacher is an option.
[1:31:33] <%bars_l> guy said it was a midway title
[1:31:34] <%SergeEXE> Shady Sands was from Fallout 1, right?
[1:31:34] <+Exyoh> Does Butch Cassidy have a comic?
[1:31:36] <%SergeEXE> the first touwn?
[1:31:39] <Parapattern> What about Myron, tho?
[1:31:40] <+Bricked> Pat! I didn't know you were playing NV. I just booted it up before turning on twitch
[1:31:41] <fluqqer3d> And we spank nerds with moon rocks
[1:31:44] <Conky89> Points for using "good" properly Marcus
[1:31:46] <commonvermin> As the tribal you can fuck a mafia bosses wife and the resulting npc is referenced in game as *not to be fucked with*
[1:31:47] <%DomunDomunDomun> Champion of Cyrodiil == Oblivion's
[1:31:47] <callsigneagle01> the sundance kid?
[1:31:50] <%afronooch> Yea Serge
[1:31:51] <%bars_l> it can be hours into the game but its the first main quest
[1:32:00] <%Das_Bass> It's great how NV never shits on the lore

[1:32:21] <commonvermin> it's great how NV built upon the Lore in an intelligent manor

[1:32:34] <timetraveller2000> I wonder if Mr House has ever met a super mutant? I don’t remember him mentioning it.
[1:32:34] <nobknee> Remember when videogames cared about story and lore? Seems like a dream to me. Kappa
[1:32:35] <buffmurffy> are ghouls immune to supermutation?
[1:32:35] <Desertfishing> TIL im a nightkin

[1:33:58] <%Gray_skies1993> Lily is pretty tragic
[1:33:58] <NumbusPlays> her voice is, uh, not the best

[1:35:26] <dekkitout> "Hey human, why is it when I'm starin' at somthing, you staring in something?"
[1:35:28] <%AncelDeLambert> because it has post game results, but a high skill requirement, and you just walk into it

[1:36:27] <Nighthawkmun> Gaddy
[1:36:29] <+BluBarracuda> It's Bones!
[1:36:30] <zafooru> but its their lips tho
[1:36:31] <Gruhunchously> Each brain gives Rex a different trait.
[1:36:35] <fluqqer3d> pat carries dog brains
[1:36:35] <Darren716> Lady is damage
[1:36:35] <yodajr99> new dog brain? does that make it a different dog?
[1:36:35] <dragoon001914> Get Gibson's brain.
[1:36:40] <Darren716> Legion is health
[1:36:41] <%Drusain> Gibson gives 25 extra DPS
[1:36:41] <@JustinianKnight> legion brain is evil
[1:36:41] <Sloavon> SPEED
[1:36:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the one from Old Lady Gibson, don't make Rex into a bad boi
[1:36:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> quick boi
[1:36:44] <commonvermin> GIBSON
[1:36:45] <Boxbunnytheliar> Gibson brain makes strong
[1:36:45] <%Gray_skies1993> honestly, Lupa's brain is the best as far as his own sanity (Rex's ending)
[1:36:46] <Parapattern> Legion brain gives armor
[1:36:46] <callsigneagle01> Mel Gibson's brain?
[1:36:47] <%ooblagis> Gibson is damage
[1:36:48] <Nighthawkmun> EVIL
[1:36:48] <%Taisuru> Makes me sad that you aren't given anothe roption other than replace the brain
[1:36:48] <%FracturedImage> Lady = DMG
[1:36:49] <MoulesFritz> legion brain makes dog MAD
[1:36:49] <Finaldragoon> Gibson brain is damage
[1:36:50] <+Buzzkill983> Legion: Power. Rex Defense, Viola SPeed
[1:36:51] <zafooru> oh my god pat don't steal the old womans brain just use her dogs
[1:36:51] <%connos_livereview> lady gibsons actual brain lol
[1:36:51] <%ItsKitKat_> Gibsons is 25 extra dps
[1:36:52] <yodajr99> what about our brain?
[1:36:53] <%ooblagis> Gibson is also a good ending for Rex
[1:36:54] <Aydarkzero> i think the Legion brain was better right?
[1:36:55] <Fujiwara_92> GIBSON FOR DAMAGE PogChamp
[1:36:56] <$undeadv13> legion brain is more vicous
[1:36:56] <fluqqer3d> fuck stats, go for good end
[1:36:57] <Gruhunchously> Gibson is damage, Legion is health.
[1:37:01] <+ahegotrigger> Legion makes the dog TOUGH
[1:37:02] <timetraveller2000> Think Gibson’s is the most well rounded stat wise
[1:37:02] <$Mighty_observer> all i really want is your... BRAIN
[1:37:05] <%NME_Dom> Gibson is best choice
[1:37:05] <ComradeConquistador> Gibson's brain makes him hate jews and go nuts.
[1:37:08] <%walternatorz> Get a RE2 doggo brain
[1:37:09] <PineappleBison> Durability and damage
[1:37:09] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> Gibson for big damage PogChamp
[1:37:12] <NumbusPlays> Don't give Rex the evil slave brain
[1:37:13] <idse12> legion brain i think gives a better ending
[1:37:15] <+Badgerconda_> Please don't kill lady Gibson's good doggo, pat.
[1:37:16] <Darren716> Also Gibson has the best ending
[1:37:19] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> i'd say gibson is you're best bet
[1:37:19] <kingra> Good <3
[1:37:19] <Pookiedaexzile> what aboot pinkeyanneduh's Brain
[1:37:19] <natebud> she has a unique shotgun to
[1:37:21] <Gruhunchously> But you should go to Gibson because Rex deserves better.
[1:37:23] <%Das_Bass> apatJpeg
[1:37:24] <%connos_livereview> MEL NO
[1:37:24] <wirblewomble> not her DOG'S brain, fuck that, take Lady Gibson's brain
[1:37:26] <$LocDogX86X> The legion increases endurance gibson is attack dam
[1:37:28] <+Crimson_Scion> @AngriestPat Are you playing with an ENB?
[1:37:28] <tadaosmad> Gibson is best doggo
[1:37:29] <%Reaped_Psyche> @AngriestPat Choosing to implant Rey's brain will give Rex the perk Faithful Protector, increasing his attack damage (+25 damage). Choosing to implant Violetta's brain will give Rex the perk Unshakeable Tracker, increasing his speed (+50% movement speed). Choosing to implant Lupa's brain will give Rex the perk Blood of the Legion, increasing his damage threshold (+10 DT).
[1:37:32] <%Stevennapalm> You don't want mel gibson's brain
[1:37:32] <pineapple_pizza0> just eat rex
[1:37:35] <%walternatorz> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[1:37:35] <%Gray_skies1993> Legion or Gibson are the best options (ending wise) Fiends is just mean
[1:37:36] <+khalcipher> that dog is called trash LUL
[1:37:36] <%Typhaeon> Naming your dog "trash", that's mean
[1:37:38] <$Mighty_observer> @ComradeConquistador so he becomes a zeon?
[1:37:40] <$TheNeedlesD> that dog's name is trash
[1:37:43] <Sloavon> ?????
[1:37:44] <ComradeConquistador> Basura was flying.
[1:37:45] <timetraveller2000> Legion’s increases his attack, think violets make him more durable?
[1:37:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[1:37:48] <dekkitout> Aw man, this next part gets a tad DARK
[1:37:48] <Gruhunchously> She's probably asleep at this hour.
[1:37:50] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat It's +10 DT for the Legion Brain
[1:37:54] <%ItsKitKat_> talk to lady gibson
[1:37:57] <%vincerocmm> come on your rich
[1:37:57] <+ahegotrigger> Fiends is maybe the best brain as being faster is over powered
[1:37:57] <Darren716> Talk to her
[1:37:58] <$cureneckbeard> Yeah but you're gonna swap him back out for ED-E later anyway
[1:37:59] <+Buzzkill983> Oh no I was wrong XD Gibson is DPS, Legion is health

[1:44:04] <tadaosmad> Factions are cool in GTA2
[1:44:20] <ComradeConquistador> Update: Marcus is voiced by Michael Dorn. I could have sworn it was Simmons, but I guess not.
[1:44:31] <Xel_Gel> who ever modeled Marcus did a god damn good job
[1:44:34] <timetraveller2000> Think the faction element might be one of new Vegas’ best features
[1:44:41] <Gruhunchously> @kiiiirsten There's a reason that lodge looks so damaged.
[1:44:42] <$Mighty_observer> Is this the future where Trump actually build the wall?

[1:45:09] <%kiiiirsten> @Gruhunchously apatSmug
[1:45:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> its weird that marcus refers to caesar by his latin name
[1:45:12] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, that's always kind of dumb. "You're the same species, won't you listen to each other?"
[1:45:12] <Latch77> @AngriestPat unrelated to nv but what are the best things to spend cp in kiwami?
[1:45:13] <fazoburquina> I like that Marcus is one of the few to pronounce Caesar right
[1:45:15] <natebud> He's one of like 10 non legion characters that say Kai-sar
[1:45:16] <%Zaxshimysham> Pat loves him some mutant purging

[1:45:35] <Nighthawkmun> Build a wall and make the muties pay for it
[1:45:35] <%Gray_skies1993> interesting that Marcus pronounces Caesar the correct way, while most other people unaffiliated with the Legion pronounced it the anglophone way
[1:45:37] <daisymaisy02> She's lovely
[1:45:38] <wydamn> Hot
[1:45:39] <dekkitout> Cause Marcus is an educated gentleman

[1:46:32] <T_Sasquatch> OH SHIT, I left the stream
[1:46:34] <PSI_Guy95> You could skullfuck her 🤔
[1:46:35] <dashmatt> that's not water pat
[1:46:37] <$Mighty_observer> calamity gundam looks cool, tobad it was destroyed because SEED IS TRASH
[1:46:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> More jerky men.
[1:46:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Gruhunchously Once the flesh starts melting, it all looks the same
[1:46:45] <T_Sasquatch> and didnt expect this LUL
[1:46:50] <Nighthawkmun> Fucking Mutie
[1:46:53] <ArtThouBored> Kotal and Shao?
[1:46:54] <$Mighty_observer> KILL HIM
[1:46:55] <%mayorrev> calm down doc
[1:46:55] <EASrake> WHY?
[1:46:57] <tadaosmad> Here's the fruit of my labor
[1:46:57] <%Shikari21> @Mighty_observer seed is good tho
[1:46:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh fuck you doctor
[1:47:00] <kingra> Fuck off ASSHOLE
[1:47:01] <@JustinianKnight> so mad
[1:47:03] <commonvermin> dude I'm doing a job for you
[1:47:04] <Parapattern> It was VERY horrible
[1:47:05] <%joylent_blue> henry looks like an even bigger nerd than he used to
[1:47:09] <%Mr_Strut> Violetta best brain!
[1:47:10] <fluqqer3d> here, take this brain idiot
[1:47:12] <timetraveller2000> Pls save my doggie BibleThump
[1:47:20] <$RubberFistFight> @Gray_skies1993 Norse pronounciation is another thing everyone gets wrong. For starters you pronounce -heim (as in Vanaheim, helheim, etc) as HAYM, and not HIME.
[1:47:22] <%kiiiirsten> I can't believe you carried Violet's brain around in your bag for weeks only to pay $700 for another dog brain
[1:47:26] <wydamn> "Why do you interrupt me again?" (Drops everything he's doing to perform brain surgery for free)
[1:47:26] <$Mighty_observer> @Shikari21 i will find you and i will break your eyes
[1:47:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> It did not
[1:47:29] <Gruhunchously> He looks like an older Arcade. Which is actually kind of fitting.
[1:47:31] <%vincerocmm> dogs live on
[1:47:32] <+DrN0rd> You fixed the good boy
[1:47:32] <ShichiNoBushi> Installs brain into Patron.
[1:47:33] <commonvermin> so
[1:47:34] <%joylent_blue> GivePLZ
[1:47:34] <%Fluxraw> best doggo
[1:47:35] <EASrake> WHY?
[1:47:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Took like 3 seconds
[1:47:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten he paid good money for a good boi
[1:47:38] <fluqqer3d> huzzah
[1:47:40] <The_Blumper> calm down asshole
[1:47:40] <%Gray_skies1993> @RubberFistFight oh interesting I actually didn't know that
[1:47:42] <+HostilePoundcakes> OhMyDog OhMyDog
[1:47:43] <+khalcipher> Rex is dead but rey will live on
[1:47:43] <commonvermin> you gonna eat that spare brain
[1:47:43] <$cureneckbeard> F
[1:47:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh rude asshole
[1:47:49] <PSI_Guy95> What are stealth boys? Are they drugso r machines or what
[1:47:50] <%Shikari21> @Mighty_observer oh no. ill agree that seed destiny is bad but not seed
[1:47:53] <dekkitout> "When I'm done with him, it will be the bork who does the busting, yes- Mwahahahaha!"
[1:48:00] <%Nedlin> Why did the game get rid of Violetta's brain? Such a waste to just throw out a delicious brain...
[1:48:03] <%Gray_skies1993> @RubberFistFight I only knew the Caesar thing because I'm a Roman history nerd
[1:48:04] <Nighthawkmun> Fucking nighties
[1:48:05] <%crimsonharvest> is he supposed to look like Bones McCoy?
[1:48:09] <wydamn> This guy acts how I act when my brother needs help with an app on his phone.
[1:48:19] <commonvermin> @psi_guy95 they're machines that cause mental health issues like schizophrenia as a side effect of prolonged use
[1:48:20] <DirtyPopcornJ> @PSI_Guy95 machines
[1:48:23] <$Mighty_observer> @Shikari21 SEED AND SEED DESTINY iis trash
[1:48:25] <tadaosmad> Stealth Boys generate fields of stealth and vibrations are kinda negative to brain functions?
[1:48:26] <%joylent_blue> stealth boys are machines that you strap on your arm or someting
[1:48:27] <timetraveller2000> Alright, time to cure schizophrenia
[1:48:29] <PSI_Guy95> Thanks chat gang
[1:48:34] <Sloavon> wow I literally tuned this guy out
[1:48:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @crimsonharvest He's a doctor, not a veterinarian!
[1:48:49] <$RubberFistFight> @Gray_skies1993 secondly, most instances of the letter "d" are actually supposed to be a letter called "eth" which is a voiced dental fricative that sounds like the "th" in there/them/those but not in thorn/thanks/thick.
[1:48:57] <%Gray_skies1993> I DO actually wonder if stealth boys are bad for humans
[1:49:01] <$Mighty_observer> @Shikari21 its naruto filler but GUNDAMS
[1:49:02] <commonvermin> Calamity that screen is off
[1:49:03] <+DrN0rd> this shit always confused me, they lead on that something special is gonna happen but nah
[1:49:05] <callsigneagle01> I missed a few NV streams. Has Pat done The Boomers' stuff yet?
[1:49:09] <+Shastafield> i heard that the voice company originally told the actors to pronounce it "ceasar" but then the fallout guys told them they wanted it pronounced "kaisar" but by that point the voice company had already gone through half the lines and didnt have the money to bring everyone back @AngriestPat
[1:49:09] <$Brother_Coduss> an entire chapter of BoS went crazy from stealthboys
[1:49:12] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[1:49:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @callsigneagle01 yes
[1:49:14] <%kiiiirsten> I just noticed Calamity's sensible heels
[1:49:15] <PSI_Guy95> So this guy is working on the Stealth Boy Advance SP?
[1:49:18] <callsigneagle01> @ThatGuyfromMars ty
[1:49:18] <$RubberFistFight> Take Odin, for example. It's meant to be spelt Oðin, which is pronounced Othin.
[1:49:21] <exalt4747> "I'm not convinced that these SNAKE COYOTES or whatever are legit"
[1:49:21] <Gruhunchously> It's kind of sweet that this guy is helping mutants, considering he was once part of the Enclave.
[1:49:23] <PSI_Guy95> Maybe even a Stealthtendo DS?
[1:49:23] <%mayorrev> LILY QUEST
[1:49:28] <ComradeConquistador> All of the Brotherhood is crazy. Fuck them.
[1:49:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @callsigneagle01 <3 he's not completely finished with them tho
[1:49:32] <Fujiwara_92> LILY SMASH
[1:49:52] <tadaosmad> Can you smash Lily?
[1:49:54] <%Gray_skies1993> @RubberFistFight oh cool, I've always wondered how some of those characters are correctly prounounced
[1:49:55] <aimlesshealer> @RubberFistFight So dick = thick in Norse?
[1:49:56] <timetraveller2000> I thought Henry working here was him actively trying to redeem himself for his past.
[1:49:58] <%mayorrev> "I'm somewhat ov a scientist myself"
[1:49:59] <Sloavon> enyave
[1:49:59] <dekkitout> Say whaaaaaa?!
[1:50:00] <%kiiiirsten> Well how convenient
[1:50:02] <Gruhunchously> Also, he just flat out admits he was part of the Enclave.
[1:50:03] <%joylent_blue> the gameboy advance SP was dope
[1:50:05] <callsigneagle01> @ThatGuyfromMars gotta get that big bomber
[1:50:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CYBER DOGS!
[1:50:09] <+linSP> what the hecks an enclave
[1:50:10] <PSI_Guy95> How is cyberdog neuroscience a viable field
[1:50:14] <%kiiiirsten> OWB!
[1:50:14] <natebud> Shoulda brought Ganon
[1:50:15] <+linSP> are they in this game
[1:50:19] <callsigneagle01> that and Nellis AFB is cool irl
[1:50:21] <CrabSlacks> "so YOU'RE a scientist?"
[1:50:24] <+miguelrod777> kinda
[1:50:26] <tadaosmad> Everyone smart was a part of the Enclave
[1:50:29] <%Ahack13> "Made a good call, seeing as I didn't die"
[1:50:29] <$Mighty_observer> @AngriestPat why you no use trainer or cheat engine?
[1:50:29] <EASrake> Really Quiet?
[1:50:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fair
[1:50:32] <callsigneagle01> Nellis is where they do Red Flag
[1:50:34] <timetraveller2000> Enclave DansGame
[1:50:36] <+khalcipher> Bye Raul
[1:50:40] <ComradeConquistador> Enclave are assholes, but they're better than the Brotherhood. Just saying.
[1:50:42] <Gruhunchously> Super Mutants are Safe and Quiet
[1:50:47] <tadaosmad> Guessing the fucking GOVRNMNT fucked everything up
[1:50:50] <callsigneagle01> bitched don't know about Red Flag
[1:50:51] <%kiiiirsten> If Keene doesnt like to be stared at he should stop standing by the front door
[1:50:53] <%joylent_blue> hit the road jack
[1:50:55] <$Mighty_observer> oh look its Liam
[1:50:56] <eco419> !uptime
[1:50:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 50m.
[1:50:59] <PSI_Guy95> Yee haw
[1:51:01] <wirblewomble> @shastafield that doesn't make sense though, unless alll of the legion lines were recorded after the fact
[1:51:03] <Xel_Gel> still think enclave tesla armor is cool
[1:51:04] <eco419> Awww late
[1:51:05] <timetraveller2000> Brotherhood are the absolute worst. DansGame
[1:51:07] <$RubberFistFight> @aimlesshealer well, "dick" would be pronounced as it's spelled, but "ðick" would be a soft "th" version of "thick", yes. If you wanted the hard "th" you'd use Þ , which is a letter called "thorn"
[1:51:07] <commonvermin> Enclave and Brotherhood have such completely different motivations and goals though
[1:51:13] <Gruhunchously> @Mighty_observer No Liams here.
[1:51:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ComradeConquistador Even the DC brotherhood? They come off as more noble than the general brotherhood clan
[1:51:15] <nobknee> Lily best girl.
[1:51:18] <PSI_Guy95> how does she know who Benny is
[1:51:20] <StromkoPenguin> @ComradeConquistador The Brotherhood tries to bogart all the technology but the Enclave just kills all wastelanders, how is that better? :D
[1:51:24] <The_Blumper> Aw thanks Grandma
[1:51:27] <callsigneagle01> @RubberFistFight you Norwegian?
[1:51:27] <+DrN0rd> thats a lie lily crime totally pays
[1:51:29] <%Rhinoprotoss> I wish Lily had a real quest
[1:51:30] <%kiiiirsten> Oh man you're getting a grandma lecture
[1:51:30] <%Fenlig> Does her sun downing remind you of anyone?
[1:51:32] <nobknee> @Mighty_observer Who's that? Sounds like a villain.
[1:51:32] <+ahegotrigger> LOL
[1:51:35] <Gruhunchously> Everyone knows who Benny is.
[1:51:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> ....how does lily know about benny
[1:51:37] <$RubberFistFight> @callsigneagle01 nope, just done my research LUL
[1:51:37] <PSI_Guy95> Stealth Girl SP!
[1:51:37] <dekkitout> Roadtrip with meemaw
[1:51:39] <commonvermin> god I hate how 3 turned Brotherhood into white knights against the evil enclave
[1:51:40] <callsigneagle01> ah
[1:51:41] <$Mighty_observer> @Gruhunchously sadly
[1:51:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> Well then
[1:51:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[1:51:46] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars the grapevine?
[1:51:46] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Lily is just old Paige. apatDab
[1:51:47] <+ahegotrigger> if only you coulc have Lily eat Benny
[1:51:47] <ComradeConquistador> I don't trust anyone who has to call themselves a "Paladin."
[1:51:48] <+linSP> shes so stealthy
[1:51:50] <commonvermin> so much less interesting
[1:51:55] <dc_8100> if you like her so much why dont you marry her pat? Kappa
[1:51:56] <PSI_Guy95> Grandma's got a!
[1:51:58] <commonvermin> YES GAM GAMS
[1:51:59] <%Drusain> SMOrc Grandma's got a present for ya
[1:51:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten must be a pretty long vine
[1:52:01] <%king_wragles> yes
[1:52:04] <godlesscruelty> oh baby
[1:52:05] <Darren716> Super sledge
[1:52:05] <+cameronfincher> old glory
[1:52:05] <%AbnormalVoid> Thermal Lance
[1:52:06] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat Theres a unique hammer in the cave you're going to
[1:52:06] <%bread_assassin> Oh Baby
[1:52:07] <natebud> The weapon in this cave @AngriestPat
[1:52:07] <Gruhunchously> Oh Baby
[1:52:07] <kingra> GRANDMAS GOT A GUN
[1:52:09] <%TheSpiritof2277> Thermic Lance probably
[1:52:09] <RetributionP> Pat loves big strong women
[1:52:09] <Darren716> Oh baby specifically
[1:52:10] <+Shastafield> @wirblewomble thats what i heard from someone who worked there
[1:52:10] <+ahegotrigger> nice
[1:52:11] <+DrN0rd> the super sledge and its right next to you
[1:52:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> super sledge??
[1:52:12] <%RNGbob> blade of the east?
[1:52:13] <%Gray_skies1993> Thermal Lance/Super Sledge
[1:52:14] <timetraveller2000> I don’t know why but Lily’s voice makes me uncomfortable :/
[1:52:14] <+cameronfincher> ulysses weapon
[1:52:15] <fluqqer3d> deathclaw thingy
[1:52:16] <$thewisewolf> the sledge youre about to find
[1:52:18] <Darren716> Oh baby is best for unarmored
[1:52:19] <KeystoneA1> Ballistic Fist or Thermal Lance I think
[1:52:19] <commonvermin> the one you get in the Nightcrawler cave nearby
[1:52:20] <RiverBirch> It's probably the Super Sledge you can get right in this cave
[1:52:20] <tadaosmad> Oh Baby
[1:52:20] <$Mighty_observer> @nobknee idk i heard it killeda country for a loli pic
[1:52:20] <+DrN0rd> yes
[1:52:23] <%commanderclaw> Depends on your spec
[1:52:23] <%PalmtopNami> the final bosses blade
[1:52:24] <nobknee> @RetributionP That's ironic. Kappa
[1:52:24] <Darren716> Thermic best for armored
[1:52:25] <kingra> Yep
[1:52:26] <DirtyPopcornJ> Thermic Lance is godlike
[1:52:26] <RiverBirch> Like RIGHT in this fucking cave
[1:52:27] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat Don't give her a unique weapon! She will break it fast and just drop it somewhere.
[1:52:27] <+Grayhammatter> Oh Baby
[1:52:28] <callsigneagle01> my fists on a shitload of drugs
[1:52:28] <+linSP> i like the bumper sword
[1:52:29] <+ahegotrigger> its the super sledge in this cave
[1:52:29] <$LocDogX86X> yeah
[1:52:29] <tadaosmad> You gonna get it
[1:52:31] <MoulesFritz> technically thermal lance, but it's DoT so it sucks
[1:52:31] <%Laecerelius> Blade of the East is pretty strong since it has a bleed effect on it
[1:52:34] <$LocDogX86X> Oh Baby !
[1:52:35] <InugamiTheHound> she's got a buster sword on her back
[1:52:35] <commonvermin> wrong way
[1:52:35] <theaplombman> wrong way
[1:52:36] <RiverBirch> Either that or Ballistic Fist.
[1:52:38] <Darren716> gotta go all around
[1:52:39] <%Fenlig> in a world with abundant ammo melee is dumb
[1:52:39] <kingra> Outside the wall
[1:52:40] <+ahegotrigger> yep you can hunt deathclaws with it
[1:52:42] <fluqqer3d> lol
[1:52:42] <commonvermin> you gotta head out first
[1:52:42] <%king_wragles> there's 3 that are tied iirc
[1:52:43] <RiverBirch> Cause Ballistic Fist is just a problem solver
[1:52:44] <%PaladinDupre> BIG ROUND
[1:52:44] <Darren716> Hate this quest because of the wall
[1:52:46] <+ahegotrigger> nope
[1:52:47] <tadaosmad> But you become weeaboo with the blade
[1:52:48] <$RubberFistFight> @callsigneagle01 I watched the God of War LP recently, and played it myself. God I laughed when Pat noped out on the pronunciation of "Skiðbluðnir"
[1:52:49] <+ahegotrigger> YEP
[1:52:51] <%brave_sj> You guys are spelling it wrong, it's Oh, Baby! with punctuation.
[1:52:51] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat unique super sledge found here. thermal lance is more DPS, but is very precise
[1:52:57] <godlesscruelty> dam Trump wall blocking the best weapon for melee
[1:53:01] <+Exyoh> My preferred melee weapon is the superheated saturnite fist
[1:53:01] <nobknee> @Fenlig Melee is cool. Your fists are bullets.
[1:53:02] <+bobfriskit> is this normal walk speed?
[1:53:02] <natebud> all the fist weapons are unarmed though
[1:53:03] <KitsuneManami> Why this and not Metro?
[1:53:05] <Gruhunchously> Build the wall
[1:53:12] <Finakala> Nothing as good as the Man Opener in FO3
[1:53:17] <InugamiTheHound> pat needs to beat metro last light first
[1:53:17] <commonvermin> @angriestpat remember you need 80 science to end this quest *and* keep Lily
[1:53:17] <timetraveller2000> The wall works LUL
[1:53:19] <+ahegotrigger> walls work lol
[1:53:19] <callsigneagle01> @RubberFistFight you done it for a while?
[1:53:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @KitsuneManami it was on his schedule
[1:53:21] <tadaosmad> The Man Opener was SICK
[1:53:22] <$RubberFistFight> It's not that hard really, it's "skith-bluth-nir" but with voiced "th" instead of voiceless.
[1:53:22] <RiverBirch> Yeah sure they're marked as unarmed.
[1:53:22] <fluqqer3d> 10 ft higher and we're making NCR pay for it
[1:53:26] <nobknee> FINISH YOUR DINNER
[1:53:27] <KitsuneManami> Aaah good idea.
[1:53:28] <RiverBirch> But fuckin, THE BALLISTIC FIST THOUGH
[1:53:29] <callsigneagle01> @KitsuneManami Cause Exodus isn't that great
[1:53:30] <$Mighty_observer> follow player speed = match
[1:53:31] <Seedlesslad> We all know Bethesda games never end
[1:53:32] <RiverBirch> ITS SO GOOD
[1:53:34] <Xel_Gel> I remember I was too strong and everyone near caesar's camp had ballistic fist
[1:53:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> metro is smelly
[1:53:37] <KitsuneManami> @callsigneagle01 says you? lol ok
[1:53:39] <%FracturedImage> yeyeyeye
[1:53:40] <sparky77> because this is WAY better than metro OBVIOUSLY

[1:55:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Woolie May Cry exists for reason

[2:03:35] <%ThePuddingDead> woah, who's the brainiac dog?
[2:03:37] <callsigneagle01> @RubberFistFight well it's easier to just lump them in with the general area stuff. Have you heard of the Legend called The Kalevala?

[2:03:52] <InugamiTheHound> its not super mutants or nightkins can wear those human clothes
[2:03:52] <+DingusMcFadden> Nothing to crazy in this spooky hotel filled with raging steroid monsters
[2:03:55] <$Mighty_observer> leave the gun, take the bear
[2:03:57] <Gruhunchously> Teddy bears in this game are heralds of bad news.

[2:06:37] <InugamiTheHound> still no points in energy weapons?
[2:06:37] <nobknee> @callsigneagle01 It actually made the hero super scary to me.
[2:06:41] <%ECRead> what better place than here, what better time than now
[2:06:43] <KeystoneA1> Check the lodges outside

[2:06:54] <StromkoPenguin> I kinda like how the 2D Fallouts let you keep putting points into skills above 100, so you never had to become a jack of all trades.
[2:06:59] <%mayorrev> rude

[2:07:17] <%FracturedImage> what abt explosives tho, you use explosives rounds?
[2:07:17] <Seedlesslad> Why do you hate technology?
[2:07:18] <silvcrest> Why do you hate everything cool in life?
[2:07:18] <+UncleAWOL> If energy weapons are for lamo-o's, why aren't you using them, lamo-o ?
[2:07:18] <tadaosmad> But which one is the creepy one
[2:07:19] <$waltzqueen> 1
[2:07:20] <Xel_Gel> But exploding 2 deathclaws ine one shot is cool
[2:07:21] <RetributionP> energy is cleaner then rocks
[2:07:22] <T_Sasquatch> my legs are ok !
[2:07:22] <+flapjackerman> aren't they some of the best weps in game?
[2:07:22] <EASrake> You just don't know about the EVE mod
[2:07:22] <Finakala> Pew pew, pewpewpew
[2:07:23] <silvcrest> 1
[2:07:25] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, recycling ammo for re-use is for losers.
[2:07:26] <%Ciphris> only the brotherhood pulls it off
[2:07:29] <$Mighty_observer> @AngriestPat You gotta do your SEED tactics\
[2:07:31] <%kiiiirsten> Jack Shit
[2:07:32] <%Mr_Strut> To be fair, you have to have a high IQ to use energy weapons.
[2:07:33] <wirblewomble> use EVE and people get blown up and vaporized n shit tho
[2:07:33] <timetraveller2000> Energy weapons can be op af tho, especially for deathclaws :/

[2:07:47] <nobknee> @callsigneagle01 I know, but especially that one. He was very intimidatin'. Clint Eastwood felt like an antihero, but Bronson felt like a psycho who needed revenge, and I love it.

[2:08:14] <Conky89> Energy Weapons are boss. In late game, they can seriously vaporize some of the toughest enemies out there
[2:08:14] <stropbopadopolis> agreed grey sky

[2:10:43] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat did you hear Chris Hemsworth is going to play Hulk Hogan in an upcoming biopic.
[2:10:43] <+PenmanLupine> I like having melee companions cause they can distract people while I shoot like a big hero from a 100 yards away
[2:10:47] <antthefool> PUNCH and BITE boiz for punch and bite poise

[2:11:23] <commonvermin> conversely, unarmed courier with Boone is the best playthrough
[2:11:34] <callsigneagle01> @ThatGuyfromMars what was the joke? I didn't see
[2:11:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I had to smack them for being an idiot
[2:11:39] <commonvermin> but also double fisting people with Veronica is a good time
[2:11:41] <+DingusMcFadden> You seem lonely. Stop thinking and talk to Lilly, loser
[2:11:41] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars For bein an IDIOT!
[2:11:48] <+ArcanumMBD> Figured you guys would get a laugh out of this: I went from Anthem defender to uninstalling the game just now. New patch made my performance worse. That game is death by a thousand cuts :/

[2:19:37] <%captainthunderwolf> Super Mutants are basically biosoldiers with no genitals or sex or gender.
[2:19:38] <+C0baltCrusade> the UL-TIMATE bio WEPUN
[2:19:39] <+JustToWatch> 10% human, 40% computer, 50% FEV
[2:19:40] <$Mighty_observer> super mutants huh? sounds like warhammer 40k
[2:19:43] <%AirlineFood74> 1
[2:19:44] <+MechaBaphomet> You can talk him into killing himself
[2:19:45] <%captainthunderwolf> Even ladies look ke that when they go Super Mutant.
[2:19:45] <%ooblagis> Most Nightkin have a secondary personality
[2:19:47] <natebud> Uncle Leo was also a random encounter pacifist mutant in Fallout 3 @AngriestPat
[2:19:51] <+MikMack2> oh good. would have preferred it be the hammer
[2:19:52] <%Feralspirit41> the master was a living mass of a buncha people fused via the fev who thought super mutants were the pinnicle of human evolution
[2:19:52] <tadaosmad> Oh, Leo is a personality? I thought it was just a manifestation of her anger
[2:19:53] <%kiiiirsten> It's just a lil schizophrenia, no big deal
[2:19:59] <%connos_livereview> thats why super mutants in 76 makes no fuckin senSE
[2:20:01] <+manwithboxonhead> You can talk him down if you tell that Super Mutants are sterile.
[2:20:01] <Boxbunnytheliar> Man gotta say, hearing the game soundtrack instead of vegas radio songs is a weird feeling
[2:20:02] <faf_d4pper> Goop
[2:20:05] <commonvermin> wow just realized Lily and Leo is God and Dog
[2:20:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats sad
[2:20:06] <CopperTucker> I know very little about Fallout...
[2:20:12] <%ooblagis> Like the Nightkin at Repconn, has a deer skull he talks to, but actually tries to tell him to chill
[2:20:12] <+Nomicro4u> Leo will remember that
[2:20:13] <%captainthunderwolf> Schizophrenic Super Mutants are a big thing, just like Dog/God from the DLC.
[2:20:16] <%kiiiirsten> @commonvermin Yes
[2:20:16] <rekinom> monkaS
[2:20:18] <+linSP> dont push leo pat
[2:20:19] <%captainthunderwolf> Dog/God is great, by the fucking way.
[2:20:23] <%Tokanova> "bold words for someone in chopping range deary"
[2:20:26] <%Gray_skies1993> another reason 76 is shit, Super Mutants are there, in a year they shouldn't be
[2:20:28] <DSD24> Its been folded over 100 times
[2:20:29] <timetraveller2000> Leo always listening WutFace
[2:20:33] <commonvermin> all the DLC are just great
[2:20:38] <%Tearonex> I love the goddamn Bumper Sword
[2:20:39] <PSI_Guy95> deep fallout lore
[2:20:41] <%mayorrev> Does Lily have a limit breaker?
[2:20:41] <pectusumbra> Neat!
[2:20:41] <%kiiiirsten> The stealth boys cause the schizophrenia which Doc Henry just explained
[2:20:44] <adamisfruit> Dog/God is super cool
[2:20:44] <$Mighty_observer> to much back story
[2:20:45] <Gruhunchously> Klamath are a bunch of assholes.
[2:20:47] <%captainthunderwolf> Bumper Swords are fucking great.
[2:20:48] <%JJCheeker> yo pat, chat apatDab sipsipDab
[2:20:48] <maccus> Oh? On God?
[2:20:50] <daisymaisy02> I wonder what she sounded like as a human
[2:20:50] <+MikMack2> i don't like when she calls you sugar
[2:20:51] <%Drusain> @commonvermin And Tabitha and Rhonda
[2:20:51] <commonvermin> ok Lonesome road is ok but that final confrontation with Ulysses is just A++
[2:20:52] <Finakala> Old World Blues best DLC
[2:20:53] <InugamiTheHound> so much stuff connected to fallout 2
[2:20:58] <%connos_livereview> LEO SAYER
[2:21:00] <%Das_Bass> Its almost as if the devs care about the lore
[2:21:01] <%ThePuddingDead> she seems sweet
[2:21:04] <DSD24> Honest Hearts has some rad shit too
[2:21:06] <CrimsonFox777> Man, I REALLY need to go back and finish Fallout 2. There's so many details I'm missing out on.
[2:21:09] <%whalewoof> this a sassy one
[2:21:10] <tadaosmad> Nightkin mutants have that schizo because of Stealth Boys, just like crack
[2:21:11] <%ooblagis> She carries an assault rifle though
[2:21:16] <%captainthunderwolf> @kiiiirsten Super Mutants do tend to just kind of lose it over time, but the Stealth Boys take their predisposition towards shit-losing and make them WAY WORSE.
[2:21:17] <+miguelrod777> good grandma
[2:21:19] <dekkitout> But Memaw, a chopper is another word for gun
[2:21:25] <KeystoneA1> The Enclave lady you find later at Novac was the one who crashed that Vertibird in Klamath
[2:21:28] <Gruhunchously> @InugamiTheHound Well, this game is kind of a direct sequel to Fallout 2, so it's to be expected.
[2:21:29] <rekinom> The character development and flavor in this game is GREAT
[2:21:30] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[2:21:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:31] <tadaosmad> Honest Hearts is SHIT, change my mind
[2:21:35] <pectusumbra> You gotta show her to Paige if you haven't already
[2:21:36] <%ooblagis> LUL
[2:21:37] <%ThePuddingDead> its like if one of the Golden Girls was an experiment from Hydra... @AngriestPat
[2:21:38] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[2:21:38] <%Piemen99> damn im late af
[2:21:42] <commonvermin> What has happened in this generation of gaming to top an argument with your own disembodied brain?
[2:21:45] <daisymaisy02> I think he's sleeping
[2:21:47] <DSD24> @tadaosmad Everything to do with Joshua Graham is rad
[2:21:47] <%riantDeliration> motherfucker have you seen any other dogs that look like THAT
[2:21:48] <ArtifexMachinae> This level of care and detail makes me really upset that Obsidian will likely never make another Fallout game... :(
[2:21:49] <FrostyBlizzard> @tadaosmad the environment is cool though FeelsBadMan
[2:21:51] <%ooblagis> King is in bed with his biddies
[2:21:51] <timetraveller2000> All this classic fallout talk and no one mentioning my boi Harold. :(
[2:21:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ??
[2:21:52] <$Mighty_observer> !downtime
[2:21:55] <+Grayhammatter> he's sleeping pat
[2:21:55] <Gruhunchously> He's upstairs.
[2:21:56] <DirtyPopcornJ> sleeping?
[2:21:57] <%ThePuddingDead> Thank you for bein a frieeeeeend
[2:21:57] <+Fyroan> he's in his upstairs room
[2:21:59] <%CubicPhantom> @rekinom you can feel the work put into it so often. it's impressive
[2:21:59] <EASrake> like a fucking ghosttown in here
[2:21:59] <evbites> upstairs
[2:22:02] <Fujiwara_92> he sleep
[2:22:02] <tadaosmad> Story is great, that's true
[2:22:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tadaosmad why do I need to change your mind? You're right!
[2:22:02] <%Gray_skies1993> @ArtifexMachinae same :(
[2:22:03] <Darren716> HH is rad, such a change of pace, some cool gear, and the Surivalist
[2:22:05] <+PenmanLupine> he in his PJs with his harem
[2:22:07] <+MikMack2> man i love the kings
[2:22:08] <KeystoneA1> King's in his room with 2 ladies
[2:22:10] <icekept> king asleep
[2:22:11] <%captainthunderwolf> @tadaosmad It's a fun little area you can leave at any time, unlike some of the other DLCs, the Burned Man is cool, and it has some of the best crafting recipes in the game. Best 9MM pistol as well.
[2:22:12] <+Meiou> pat you cant talk. your king weird
[2:22:13] <Darren716> Also Joshua Grahm is the shit
[2:22:13] <commonvermin> p a r t y h a r d
[2:22:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead traveled round the world and back again
[2:22:16] <tadaosmad> Still shit tho', compared to Dead Money
[2:22:17] <wirblewomble> he's upstairs
[2:22:21] <icekept> asleep
[2:22:22] <tadaosmad> Also, Big MT
[2:22:28] <Darren716> Dead Moneys the worst of the bunch
[2:22:30] <Gruhunchously> @timetraveller2000 Poor Harold. Survived so long and then Bethesda go their hands on him and turned him into a tree.
[2:22:34] <FrostyBlizzard> The radios honestly kill dead money for me
[2:22:38] <DSD24> I feel like all the DLCS are good in Fallout New Vegas
[2:22:39] <+Nomicro4u> I'm already Pacer
[2:22:39] <%Svanyr> Could it be!
[2:22:40] <PineappleBison> Joshua graham is my favourite character

[2:22:41] <MarylandJutsu> EMLO

[2:24:00] <%captainthunderwolf> Old World Blues does COMPLETELY fuck the game's balancing, though. Like, even just the Photon Axes will let you borderline ignore enemy levels for the rest of the game.

[2:24:07] <+Grayhammatter> he out
[2:24:10] <Gruhunchously> It's funny because, in a way, Dead Money is pure Obsidian. Great characters, somber tone, depressing atmosphere and wonky as hell gameplay.
[2:24:10] <%walternatorz> dogo jealous

[2:24:30] <commonvermin> doing any of the DLC will leave you so overloaded for the base game
[2:24:31] <DSD24> Has Pat done any of the DLC btw?

[2:25:18] <DSD24> Joshua has a cool voice too
[2:25:20] <Conky89> I would say the biggest issue with this game is with the balance. Some stuff is just hideously broken that makes certain challenges irrelevant.

[2:26:44] <DSD24> @tadaosmad And a actual Cyborg

[2:27:02] <%Gray_skies1993> @callsigneagle01 history in general? or history of the WW's?

[2:27:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 27m.
[2:27:10] <timetraveller2000> So is anyone else upset about no persona q2 localisation va?
[2:27:14] <callsigneagle01> The important thing being that beyond being a bloody slugfest in itself, it also led to the slaughter on the Somme and the Brusilov Offensive in the east, basically being one of the bloodiest points in warfare
[2:27:19] <+CezrDaPleazr> Hell ye more Fallout!
[2:27:20] <Conky89> Keep in mind I'm the type of guy who thinks a jack-of-all-trades build is a major pitfall and that min-maxing is boring, but to each their own.
[2:27:21] <tadaosmad> @DSD24 Without spine, brains or heart. Fucking just an avatar of conscience
[2:27:31] <jabu__jabu> Aww did pat end up getting to sawcon?
[2:27:32] <dekkitout> You're basically Barry from Archer, depending on how you end OWB
[2:27:32] <tadaosmad> Pat's WET DREAM
[2:27:35] <callsigneagle01> @Gray_skies1993 I focus on modern and military, though my BoA is in general history
[2:27:40] <commonvermin> I always consider my builds complete when I can do the Deathclaws in Sloan without cheesing them
[2:27:50] <callsigneagle01> cause my uni doesn't have one for military science or military history
[2:27:50] <%captainthunderwolf> @commonvermin In fact, the vicious shit-stomping that you encounter early on in the game if you take the short route to New Vegas at the hands of five Deathclaws makes you feel very weak early on!
[2:27:53] <liquid_retro> @captainthunderwolf heya, was a long time viewer of the SFBP, never had time for streams but im here now
[2:28:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> welcome!
[2:28:05] <commonvermin> FUCK that thing
[2:28:09] <%kiiiirsten> @captainthunderwolf Being one hit killed by a single deathclaw backhand is a humbling experience!
[2:28:10] <%ThePuddingDead> what up Liqud
[2:28:13] <%Gray_skies1993> @callsigneagle01 oh nice! I admit I don't know as much modern history as I'd like to, but I've learned quite a bit about military and classical history
[2:28:14] <timetraveller2000> My strategy for death laws in nv is: let Boone deal with it Kappa
[2:28:16] <%captainthunderwolf> @Conky89 Wait, if you don't like spread-out utility builds OR specialization, what do you like?
[2:28:17] <commonvermin> It has HIGHER perception than normal!
[2:28:20] <%joylent_blue> welcome to the strim stram
[2:28:25] <%TheSpiritof2277> how you doing Liquid apatDab
[2:28:31] <jabu__jabu> I bet nobody here has been to sawcon Kappa
[2:28:38] <tadaosmad> Deathclaws should be unkillable without atomic weaponry
[2:28:40] <commonvermin> God I want to play New Vegas so badly now but I also want to sleep tonight
[2:28:43] <%kiiiirsten> @jabu__jabu Speak for yourself apatLiz
[2:28:43] <Finakala> I did the good ol' walk the wrong way out of the vault in FO3 and right into a Deathclaw I went
[2:28:48] <%joylent_blue> sawcon? pvpSass pvpSlay
[2:28:50] <%captainthunderwolf> @kiiiirsten Remember discovering how Deathclaws run SLIGHTLY faster than you do, and will always catch you in time? Great moment, that.
[2:28:50] <callsigneagle01> @Gray_skies1993 there's a lot of interesting things you can find about it. I say 'modern' and by that I mean 20th Century, cause that's kinda what passes for modern
[2:28:56] <DSD24> @tadaosmad I always get my brain back
[2:28:56] <liquid_retro> Its funny that i catch Pat playing New Vegas, I just started a new playthrough today
[2:29:06] <Gruhunchously> @captainthunderwolf That's the great thing this game does. Making you feel weak and vulnerable at the beginning makes it all the more satisfying when you revisit those places as a Death Incarnate.
[2:29:06] <%ThePuddingDead> still good?
[2:29:10] <%kiiiirsten> @captainthunderwolf The desperate jumping onto rocks praying they can't fight the geometry
[2:29:10] <callsigneagle01> Just that today Verdun started which basically kicked off the bloodiest year of WW1
[2:29:13] <+DingusMcFadden> His cat's name is PeePee? When's he gonna get a dog and name it Poopy?
[2:29:21] <commonvermin> I always end up starting several playthroughs at once

[2:29:31] <JamJamX3> Who's Skelmo? LUL
[2:29:33] <%dumemoto> Ahh yes, more New Vegas. Weird to see you playing a game with guns. Considering your RE2 play through where you never used them. apatDab
[2:29:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten and then, when you finally feel like you've lost them, a cazadore pops up and ruins your day
[2:29:37] <%Typhaeon> All righty
[2:29:39] <%Gray_skies1993> @callsigneagle01 true, doesn't the word Modern mostly apply to the 20th century era anyway? I think technically we're now in the Atomic/Information era?
[2:29:39] <%kiiiirsten> @DingusMcFadden He goes by the distinguished nickname "Elmo"
[2:29:42] <Conky89> I go for specialization, but not to the most meta god builds (that is what min-maxing means). Trying to even out everything just makes for a painfully mediocre character that just bumbles their way through the game
[2:29:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:29:43] <%captainthunderwolf> @Gruhunchously Oh, absolutely. Best part of any Fallout game, and New Vegas nails it.

[2:30:13] <Gruhunchously> @captainthunderwolf The player's own story of conquering Quarry Junction is better than the main plot of any Bethesda game.

[2:30:47] <callsigneagle01> @Gray_skies1993 yeah, it changes from person to person but that's the general thing. But I know a bunch of dumb little trivia factoids about history. Did you know Molotov Cocktails didn't actually come from Russia? They were actually made to be used against them

[2:32:10] <%captainthunderwolf> @kiiiirsten Easy Pete's the motherfucker who forces my compulsive ass to dump a few points into Explosives that I'll never use for his sidequest dialogue. He's a rascal and a bad man.
[2:32:10] <PSI_Guy95> Reset the timer!
[2:32:12] <Gruhunchously> I know some people who think that Battle Angel is really good.

[2:32:24] <DSD24> Fallout 76's suffering is nothing short of DIVINE
[2:32:24] <ZaibatsuFan> What if I told you it has Blade Wolves?
[2:32:29] <%kiiiirsten> @captainthunderwolf And that's why we let Joe Cobb shoot first!
[2:32:33] <battlebeast67> it was good imo
[2:32:34] <Gruhunchously> @timetraveller2000 He is. That's him in the background
[2:32:34] <%captainthunderwolf> @Gruhunchously They've got the right to die by my fucking hands.
[2:32:35] <commonvermin> it's definitely not bad, like not a bad video game at all
[2:32:35] <callsigneagle01> @Gray_skies1993 yeah it was developed by the Finns in the Winter War. They didn't have many anti-tank munitions so they came up with gas in a bottle and a flame. They called it 'Molotov Cocktails' after the Soviet diplomat at the time who was a major ass
[2:32:36] <Mrthepastyrider> Apparently he had hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo that is mathematically impossible according to Bethesda, so i dunno.
[2:32:45] <%ooblagis> Mind you, it was a dupe glitch that was in the game because Bethesda is shit, but hey
[2:32:45] <$Mighty_observer> fallout 76 never had a clock to start with
[2:32:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:32:48] <callsigneagle01> and they proceeded to fuck the Soviets up till Spring
[2:32:48] <timetraveller2000> :O
[2:32:49] <+Nenatab> I went in expecting to not like the Alita film and left loving it.
[2:32:50] <CrimsonFox777> CLONE ELMO
[2:32:51] <commonvermin> maybe it's not what a lot of people want in a souls game but it's still a good video game
[2:32:52] <$RubberFistFight> @ThePuddingDead luckily I don't have to deal with that. All of my cats are indoor only. Stray cats are a big problem for Aussie wildlife, plus they can't defend themselves against big dogs, and assholes in cars who get their kicks running cats over. We live near a main road, so...
[2:32:52] <KeystoneA1> screm
[2:32:55] <dekkitout> Elmo does not approve
[2:32:55] <%connos_livereview> HE WONT TRUST YOU ANYMORe
[2:32:55] <%kiiiirsten> Elmo ARGUES
[2:32:55] <%UncleAWOL> apatBlep
[2:32:55] <RiverBirch> That was based on a SHITTY STAT COUNTER
[2:32:56] <+Toast_Master_General> He screm
[2:32:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Elmo will Remember That*
[2:32:59] <+Grayhammatter> he cry because he cry
[2:32:59] <+manwithboxonhead> @dsd24 The Punishment is indeed Legendary.
[2:33:00] <%joylent_blue> clone your pet and then take the clone to the original's gravestone
[2:33:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> EMLO
[2:33:05] <%Plague_Nurse> apatPorgmo
[2:33:07] <ZaibatsuFan> ELMO KNOWS
[2:33:07] <%joylent_blue> make them stare at it
[2:33:13] <commonvermin> Elmo wants a cyborg body
[2:33:15] <Sinister_Aglet> elmo wants to be eternal
[2:33:15] <RiverBirch> He'd been trading around the same ammo from the 2nd account to his main one
[2:33:16] <%Svanyr> He is pissssssssed
[2:33:18] <PSI_Guy95> Crying baby Emlo
[2:33:19] <%ThePuddingDead> I would've loved to clone my spock if he was the same in everyway, just younger
[2:33:21] <dekkitout> We are Legion, for we are Elmo
[2:33:21] <$Mighty_observer> CLONMO
[2:33:22] <CrimsonFox777> An army of Elmo clones to take over the world.
[2:33:23] <%kiiiirsten> yes! obviously! didn't you hear him?
[2:33:23] <DSD24> @manwithboxonhead Its Legendary even in hell
[2:33:24] <ZaibatsuFan> NEW LORE
[2:33:27] <DavidSanChan> Elmo brand Jellmo, the wiggly misshapen treat
[2:33:27] <DrMoose7> Elmo is eternal
[2:33:28] <Acidshocker> I thought it was proven that he was cheating?
[2:33:29] <lucidcalyx> Replace Elmo’s brain
[2:33:30] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat don't clone from birth clone from a save state
[2:33:30] <%ECRead> very scremy
[2:33:30] <RiverBirch> and just by the fact he was getting the ammo back, upped the counter of ammo
[2:33:30] <ZaibatsuFan> PogChamp
[2:33:32] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[2:33:33] <%kiiiirsten> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo Clone me!
[2:33:36] <%connos_livereview> clonemo
[2:33:38] <%Gray_skies1993> @callsigneagle01 hah, that name is clever in that case. Makes sense too, since something like that would definitely help without proper anti-tank stuff
[2:33:39] <KeystoneA1> Yeet.
[2:33:40] <+Gadur26> I love clonemo
[2:33:40] <%ElenaManetta> i came back from a shower! is pat sleepy tired giving up now
[2:33:43] <%mayorrev> YEET
[2:33:43] <RiverBirch> It was all because of a stupid stat counter.
[2:33:46] <%TheSpiritof2277> The Elmo gene must survive apatPorgmo
[2:33:47] <%joylent_blue> Acidshocker i think that was a different guy?
[2:33:47] <stropbopadopolis> elmo wants to be an immortal toilet just like dad
[2:33:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Give Gramma a kiss!
[2:33:48] <%captainthunderwolf> Basically, Fallout 76 gives every item a unique ID tag to keep an eye on it in the server, including ammunition, and having an enormous amount of ammo can crash servers. So, they ban people who have too much, because their game has a shitty inventory system.
[2:33:53] <$RubberFistFight> @ThePuddingDead in terms of temperament he probably would have been. But he obviously wouldn't be "the same cat". It'd be more akin to a twin, or a child.
[2:34:01] <lucidcalyx> Take the damage buff for Elmo’s brain
[2:34:02] <%afronooch> @tadaosmad I used to, but stopped when it got all circlejerky
[2:34:02] <%Plague_Nurse> Elclome
[2:34:03] <$RubberFistFight> I don't know if i could do that to any of my cats.
[2:34:05] <%connos_livereview> @ElenaManetta no its intermission
[2:34:16] <+linSP> I think I read a book as a kid where a dude makes clones of himself so he can transplant his brain into them when his body gets too old
[2:34:18] <$Tuskor13> he scream
[2:34:21] <$Mighty_observer> pats not immortal but he is a toilet... cause he full of shit
[2:34:22] <ScreamingMeat> Elmos pissed on his socks
[2:34:22] <%electrokev007> How dare you drink coke, I I C'EST PEPSI
[2:34:22] <$RubberFistFight> I mean I'm going to be inconsolable when they eventually do go, but getting them cloned is like...
[2:34:24] <alwayspronking> wut
[2:34:28] <%Gray_skies1993> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[2:34:29] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat think you'd do another hollow knight stream right before silksong comes out?
[2:34:29] <%ooblagis> WOOF

[2:34:30] <commonvermin> feed your child pat
[2:34:32] <%st4rrytea> huh???
[2:34:33] <$Tuskor13> the anthem load screens are also longer than the fucking GAMEPLAY
[2:34:35] <Ion_LaserX> LUL
[2:34:35] <+DingusMcFadden> What's your favorite Buscemi role, @AngriestPat ?
[2:34:36] <%topendbuzz> 4x TIMES?
[2:34:37] <DatAsuna> That's a dumb comparison
[2:34:37] <dekkitout> How are they next to Bloodborne's at launch?
[2:34:38] <%TheSpiritof2277> 4x jesus christ
[2:34:38] <PSI_Guy95> is Emlo gonna whine all stream long now
[2:34:40] <commonvermin> pile more food on top or he'll starve
[2:34:40] <callsigneagle01> @Gray_skies1993 yeah, most of the Finns weapons were Soviet ones they captured from them. It was easy cause the Soviets tended to follow the roads so the Finns just used Ski troops and moved through the woods and eventually surrounded whole divisions.
[2:34:40] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:34:43] <$Mighty_observer> F for bioware
[2:34:44] <timetraveller2000> OOOFF O_o

[2:34:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Sudden Realization that '06 was 13 years ago*
[2:34:46] <callsigneagle01> It was retardedly one-sided
[2:34:47] <+LiveStreamOnyx> lorNANI
[2:34:51] <DatAsuna> @dekkitout still a good 40 seconds shorter than bloodborne
[2:34:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Setting In*
[2:34:53] <%ThePuddingDead> @RubberFistFight Yeah...just miss the loving fucker, he looked exactly like elmo but with short hair, 15 years my lil bro, he was the best
[2:34:53] <fluqqer3d> yay no more donations
[2:34:53] <%captainthunderwolf> I'd clone my pets, but only under the clause that they're recognized as independent animals, not "sequels".
[2:34:54] <%ooblagis> You never beat Grimm, you coward

[2:35:06] <+DingusMcFadden> Is Elmo in heat?
[2:35:10] <$Tuskor13> King Groupie? That's my favorite character!
[2:35:10] <%topendbuzz> the baby cries
[2:35:13] <callsigneagle01> and exceedingly embarrassing to the Red Army
[2:35:15] <+manwithboxonhead> ScaredyCat

[2:35:26] <commonvermin> poor baby
[2:35:27] <%Gray_skies1993> @callsigneagle01 kind of reminds me of how the British were so obvious in their movements in the Revolution
[2:35:27] <%connos_livereview> is it the same dog if new brain tho
[2:35:27] <%captainthunderwolf> I genuinely can't fucking believe that NINTENDO saved Scalebound, like holy shit.

[2:36:19] <%captainthunderwolf> This quest is nonsense because you're replacing the old dog's mind, essentially, with another dog's.

[2:39:20] <%TheSpiritof2277> Bitter Springs NCR did nothing wrong
[2:39:21] <%captainthunderwolf> The Great Khans are either bitches because they're Khan wannabes who established a desert-wide drug ring, or they're AWESOME because they're Khan wannabes who established a desert-wide drug ring.
[2:39:25] <RiverBirch> I MEAN, I have no idea who Urien is

[2:40:24] <$Tuskor13> Wait do the Khans refer to their leader as Daddy
[2:40:24] <callsigneagle01> @Seedlesslad the last movie they had was The Conqueror
[2:40:26] <%kiiiirsten> @ComradeConquistador Holy shit, I looked!
[2:40:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it's called a plumbloom @kiiiirsten
[2:40:29] <%JJCheeker> Papa Nihil > Papa Kahn
[2:40:33] <+ahegotrigger> this is based off of a biker gang called the mongols that do all the things the Khans do
[2:40:34] <$cureneckbeard> Shane Johnson
[2:40:35] <%ElenaManetta> For no particular reason, what are Papa Khan's weaknesses?
[2:40:38] <%captainthunderwolf> @Seedlesslad Listen man, they've got enough drugs to be whoever they want to be.

[2:40:59] <%captainthunderwolf> @ahegotrigger I've heard that! The Pagans ran a similar operation in parts of the US for a while.
[2:41:01] <commonvermin> Love how YesMan is super racist against the Khans

[2:41:43] <SpookySpaghooti> whoa I was not expecting that, I have literally never seen this area

[2:41:48] <natebud> He must be new here
[2:41:49] <JamJamX3> "Et tu brute?"
[2:41:49] <%JJCheeker> CAAARL!
[2:41:49] <%Mr_Strut> Why does he NOT use the latin name?
[2:41:50] <%ooblagis> Sounds legit

[2:42:15] <%captainthunderwolf> Woke: Cooperating for just long enough to kill the Dog Guy and get his AWESOME wolf helmet.
[2:42:16] <%ThePuddingDead> remember the LAST TIME that happened?
[2:42:19] <timetraveller2000> Wait, he said CeeSar? Not Caeser?
[2:42:19] <Gruhunchously> @Gray_skies1993 He's spent too much time among the profligates. He is now dissolute.
[2:42:21] <%ooblagis> "Allies"
[2:42:21] <beefomkers> Hi Pat.
[2:42:23] <+MechaBaphomet> the futa
[2:42:23] <TranquilTurnip> Are they really that great tho
[2:42:23] <%kiiiirsten> At least Caesar employed one black guy to his vast army. Equal opportunity!
[2:42:24] <infamy425> ello
[2:42:28] <%Gray_skies1993> seems so @Gruhunchously lol
[2:42:28] <Gruhunchously> Leave the hut
[2:42:29] <+ahegotrigger> Doesnt karl take Fox boys place
[2:42:29] <mgs3ladderscene> The neat thing about ceaser is his name changes pronunciation depending on what faction is saying it
[2:42:33] <SpookySpaghooti> @commonvermin no kidding! I didn't even know Jacobstown was a location you could visit, I wonder how much of the game I havent seen
[2:42:36] <%AirlineFood74> @TheSpiritof2277 LUL
[2:42:36] <%ooblagis> You need to start endgame
[2:42:36] <%FracturedImage> break into karls room
[2:42:38] <natebud> Should already have it with Yes Man quest
[2:42:40] <+PenmanLupine> speak with the drug makers?
[2:42:41] <+ahegotrigger> steal the legion guys Diary
[2:42:42] <+TastySammiches> @AngriestPat take the pointy hat
[2:42:43] <PSI_Guy95> The Lame Khans morel ike it ha ha ha hah
[2:42:44] <+Vagueon> To break the truce steal Karls journal
[2:42:45] <KeystoneA1> I always butcher all the Khans here
[2:42:48] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat did you see bethesda ban a FO76 player for having too much ammo
[2:42:48] <SpookySpaghooti> Not even everyone in the Legion says Caesar correctly
[2:43:01] <+Vagueon> to ally them with the NCR talk to colonel Moore
[2:43:02] <%joylent_blue> mayorrev yeah he mentioned it earlier LUL
[2:43:04] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Kay Sar
[2:43:07] <$Mighty_observer> wait...... WHY IS EVERYBODY A GREAT KHAN
[2:43:07] <%AirlineFood74> @mayorrev the 900 hour guy? that was a duper
[2:43:07] <SpookySpaghooti> The Chairmen are the sickest though why do they need to die
[2:43:08] <Gruhunchously> Talk to Papa Khan and ask him to break the alliance wiht Ceasar
[2:43:13] <%yet_another_brony> something in karls room
[2:43:14] <Gruhunchously> Go back to the hut
[2:43:15] <dekkitout> Papa clearly don't know shit 'bout Hydra
[2:43:17] <%mayorrev> oh i mustve missed him say it lmao
[2:43:17] <alexandrecau> Bet they actually called him cicero but Karl sucks so much at roman names it lead to him being called karl
[2:43:19] <TranquilTurnip> Our papa taught us not to be ashamed of our dicks
[2:43:21] <timetraveller2000> I thought Caeser punished those who mispronounce his name tho
[2:43:23] <stropbopadopolis> that sounded like yuri lowell
[2:43:26] <%ooblagis> But yeah, sequence breaking and taking the Caesar's Legion's guy journal MIGHT work, I don't know
[2:43:28] <Gruhunchously> Go talk to Papa Khan again.
[2:43:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the great khans are cool cause they got that one austrialian gal
[2:43:29] <%captainthunderwolf> "Ah-way, true tooo Kayser." - Legionnaire #314
[2:43:31] <%Gray_skies1993> lol that's good @alexandrecau
[2:43:37] <%mayorrev> That's my grandma you bitch
[2:43:40] <natebud> What upside does this mod offer at this point?
[2:43:40] <Gruhunchously> I like how NPCs react to your companions
[2:43:40] <commonvermin> @spookyspaghooti check out the whole Northeastern map below the Boomers territory. Tons of legion and NCR content there I didn't find until 10 playthroughs in
[2:43:47] <timetraveller2000> YOU JUST NOTICED?
[2:43:51] <zebexter> she's a sweet lady
[2:43:51] <%Gray_skies1993> @ThatGuyfromMars Melissa Lewis!!
[2:43:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?????
[2:43:59] <alexandrecau> What crueler punishment than kissing up backwater tribe? Caesar is cruel
[2:44:01] <+ahegotrigger> yep there you go
[2:44:02] <%snow_bush> You have?
[2:44:05] <%captainthunderwolf> The Great Khans have a great fucking logo, let's not beat around the bush.
[2:44:09] <commonvermin> There's a lot of the map the main quest never asks you to go to
[2:44:12] <callsigneagle01> You're close to being an enemy of ceaser tho! S-stopit!
[2:44:13] <%Gray_skies1993> @captainthunderwolf I agree
[2:44:15] <fluqqer3d> cuz im a cool guy
[2:44:17] <$Mighty_observer> cause i got da guns

[2:44:34] <Gruhunchously> Now leave the hut
[2:44:36] <%kiiiirsten> Caesar promised I'll be president of the moon when this is all over, so don't shit talk him!
[2:44:37] <%Das_Bass> ask Joshy about that
[2:44:38] <%Gray_skies1993> and you took Caesar at his WORD? You're stupid as fuck Papa
[2:44:40] <$RubberFistFight> "seezer"? it's KY-SAR you fucking troglodyte.
[2:44:47] <timetraveller2000> Ceaser said it, so it must be true Kappa
[2:44:48] <+Emperor_Bad> Regis Khan sure has a great ring to it
[2:44:48] <%joylent_blue> you're not actually supposed to mention becoming slaves to him, makes convincing him harder
[2:44:48] <Gruhunchously> This guy is slow on the uptake
[2:44:50] <KeystoneA1> Steal Karl's notebook
[2:44:50] <%captainthunderwolf> Ahway, true to Kayssar.

[2:45:40] <%ooblagis> ??
[2:45:40] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I heard a dog. KILL IT FOR ITS BRAIN.

[2:45:54] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat don't mention slavery to papa khan, makes convincing him harder
[2:45:56] <%ooblagis> The journal is in his room
[2:45:57] <%ElenaManetta> When I played Skyrim, I didn't even know you could power up your magic powers because I never did the story missions
[2:46:00] <%captainthunderwolf> @Mighty_observer "Brain tumor" is my stealth pick for that one.
[2:46:00] <KeystoneA1> It's in Karl's room over there
[2:46:00] <+miguelrod777> it's in his room
[2:46:01] <%AirlineFood74> @Spireman tuesday

[2:46:05] <EASrake> Yeah of course he would
[2:46:06] <ArtThouBored> @Spireman feels great to not play Apex
[2:46:11] <timetraveller2000> Everyone can hear you lily

[2:46:14] <%Das_Bass> Papa is a real moron
[2:46:15] <%MagickBurritoh> he's a dick
[2:46:16] <SpookySpaghooti> OF COURSE HE WOULD IDIOT, He's CAESAR's REPRESENTATIVE
[2:46:21] <Gruhunchously> Ceasar's representative says he doesn't suck. What do you say about that?
[2:46:21] <%Gray_skies1993> ^
[2:46:27] <%connos_livereview> skyrim story was pretty generic from what i played
[2:46:27] <%Mr_Strut> Explore, dumbass

[2:46:48] <%captainthunderwolf> @kiiiirsten Haha, same! An NCR guy got aggroed by an enemy between conversations and literally never refreshed his quest dialogue.
[2:46:49] <SpookySpaghooti> "Don't worry Tiananmen Square didnt happen, the Chinese government says so!"
[2:46:53] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat it's in the footlocker you ignored
[2:46:53] <dekkitout> I mean, Alduin as a concept is pretty interesting
[2:46:54] <raven_frame> "You think the representative of the guy might be making him sound better than he is?"
[2:47:00] <%AirlineFood74> iirc
[2:47:00] <fallacy8> his veins

[2:47:07] <%kiiiirsten> @captainthunderwolf that was the last time I played, RIP
[2:47:08] <commonvermin> HOLD UP I'm pretty sure there's a way to get Karl to say racist shit out loud and the Khan's immediately shoot his ass
[2:47:11] <exalt4747> Wow, somebody actually heard a conversation that happened near them.
[2:47:11] <$Mighty_observer> make the great khans great again!?
[2:47:12] <%captainthunderwolf> @Mighty_observer I murder both of them, so "Me" is also a strong middle option.

[2:48:18] <Conky89> The lies! The lies!
[2:48:19] <commonvermin> like he says "Khan's are filthy degenerates that will never be a member of the legion" *right next to papa*
[2:48:20] <daisymaisy02> How do all of them know literally nothing about the Legion??
[2:48:21] <callsigneagle01> Mellencamps can tell you about a lotta shit

[2:48:36] <%captainthunderwolf> @Mighty_observer I always play with huge big Persuasion, but I shoot Caesar for being a BITCH. I usually do try to win over Papa Khan, but Caesar takes slaves and crucifies, so I start his quest chain and then murder him once I've earned his trust.
[2:48:36] <raven_frame> Karl has a high speech like you do Pat.
[2:48:40] <commonvermin> probably most of them can't read
[2:48:42] <Gruhunchously> It's more fun if you can get Karl to talk shit about the Khans publicly. .
[2:48:44] <tadaosmad> Khans are not really educated. Shoulda seen that coming.
[2:48:46] <sileo_patronus> Oh we're on the Khan's quest, neat

[2:49:47] <UnderpaidBob> see zer
[2:49:50] <commonvermin> but that's Papa's goal and most Khan's just want peace. almost like the faction isn't a monolith and instead has different personalities with competing goals for the faction
[2:49:50] <%Gray_skies1993> @captainthunderwolf love what he says if he kills Caesar: "Thumbs down, you son of a bitch!"

[2:59:30] <%yet_another_brony> did the mod just give her whiteface?
[2:59:30] <%captainthunderwolf> @Mighty_observer The Legion makes them carry packs twice their size uphill all day. The Wasteland's fucked, but the Legion are systemically fucked.
[2:59:35] <%mayorrev> take his suit!
[2:59:36] <%captainthunderwolf> Why is he in a radsuit?
[2:59:38] <beefomkers> Get some help
[2:59:40] <tadaosmad> What the-
[2:59:43] <%kiiiirsten> @captainthunderwolf Cause he's rad
[2:59:46] <%TrulyIncandescent> He had a rad suit on cause of the barrels that got dropped Lol
[2:59:48] <KeystoneA1> He has a suit as a result of Pat irradiating the camp with the nuclear waste
[2:59:49] <%laserbeaming> Did Pat explode the Brotherhood bunker?
[2:59:49] <%captainthunderwolf> @kiiiirsten Damn
[2:59:50] <+ahegotrigger> LOOT him
[2:59:52] <Gruhunchously> Because the radiation
[2:59:53] <natebud> You missed the prompt didn't you pat
[2:59:54] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:54] <%FracturedImage> Pat dumped a bunch of toxic barrels in an early quest
[2:59:58] <%mayorrev> thank u bot
[2:59:59] <rekinom> @RubberFistFight Yep, two kids doin' the best that they can
[3:00:00] <+Grayhammatter> GLASS HIM
[3:00:00] <%ooblagis> No, Pat, you find proof in Caesar's camp, OR you can stat check it
[3:00:00] <+TastySammiches> time to swim in the poopy water
[3:00:01] <PSI_Guy95> I love you stay hydrated bot!!!
[3:00:02] <dekkitout> Hail Hydrate
[3:00:03] <%captainthunderwolf> @KeystoneA1 That's a fantastic detail.
[3:00:03] <tadaosmad> Oooh. I see.
[3:00:04] <alrobot2014> @ahegotrigger he's supposed to take you to the fort from the raft, but since pat decimated this place with extreme radiation he has to put on a suit
[3:00:06] <%captainthunderwolf> This game is great.
[3:00:06] <commonvermin> if you pour the radiation barrels from the truck he puts it on so you still have a way to get to the fort the first time
[3:00:07] <42nfl19> Is there a level limit to this game and is it possible to max out all stats?
[3:00:09] <zebexter> drink the corpse water
[3:00:11] <natebud> Use the boat
[3:00:11] <krewl123> what
[3:00:13] <+miguelrod777> how is the water no irradiated
[3:00:13] <%captainthunderwolf> This game is so fucking good.
[3:00:13] <$Mighty_observer> @captainthunderwolf kanye told me that slavery is a choice...
[3:00:15] <conflict1914> pat what are you doing
[3:00:16] <+ahegotrigger> AH okay
[3:00:16] <TheBigO75> wut
[3:00:19] <tadaosmad> You fucked the place with rads. You monster.
[3:00:26] <%kiiiirsten> That's actually thoughtful of them to put the suit on him
[3:00:27] <alexandrecau> @captainthunderwolf he is the only smart legionnary so he knows a rad suit near poisoned water is good measure
[3:00:29] <CastellanVon> max level is 50 with all the DLCs and its very easy to max every skill
[3:00:29] <%captainthunderwolf> @Mighty_observer Kanye's working on the Caesar's dime.
[3:00:32] <tadaosmad> Killing with bullets is better
[3:00:32] <Gruhunchously> That's a really great detail.
[3:00:33] <$Mighty_observer> pat witht he close range snipping
[3:00:34] <callsigneagle01> Is it cause he's wearing the beret?
[3:00:36] <%kiiiirsten> @tadaosmad It's okay, he didn't drop the barrels until AFTER he killed everyone
[3:00:37] <natebud> Just use the raft
[3:00:38] <+manwithboxonhead> I’m staying hydrated by wine and water. Otherwise W&W

[3:00:51] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Pat theres a stat check you can pass OR you can go to Caeser's camp to find proof
[3:00:51] <tadaosmad> @kiiiirsten Ah! It's fine then.
[3:00:54] <%Gray_skies1993> but..the Colorado isn't poisoned @alexandrecau
[3:00:58] <callsigneagle01> oh

[3:01:07] <%joylent_blue> "oh"
[3:01:07] <raven_frame> Did he free the slaves before he dumped the radiation?
[3:01:10] <callsigneagle01> Cause Boone will not allow you to wear sick spaceman threads
[3:01:11] <conflict1914> pat what the fuck
[3:01:11] <alexandrecau> Yes I think pat dumped the waste there
[3:01:12] <alrobot2014> while hanging out with boone you murdered everyone and became a saint
[3:01:12] <%kiiiirsten> Let's put a boot in Caesar's ass yeehaw
[3:01:12] <PSI_Guy95> Boone shot all KINDS of people. Caesar's Legion, Raiders, you name it
[3:01:14] <+PenmanLupine> lol, you shot the legion in the canyon when you were big cheating the Riot Gear
[3:01:14] <commonvermin> did you guys see Rex fucking glaring at Pat for wearing a hat

[3:01:27] <+manwithboxonhead> @raven_frame Yes
[3:01:27] <%captainthunderwolf> @alexandrecau The idea that a lot of people in the Fallout setting literally do not understand or are not aware of radiation on a fundamental level always fucks me up. One day you drink some water, the next day you have no skin.

[3:04:14] <%AirlineFood74> @PelySux22 cos Pat's using a terrible face mod
[3:04:16] <raven_frame> You can clear a bunch of skill checks with the brother for experience and karma.
[3:04:16] <PSI_Guy95> her bandanna hides her skin transition
[3:04:18] <%captainthunderwolf> @PSI_Guy95 Listen man, it's tough living in the desert.
[3:04:19] <+Mrmugz> she's just wearing a vest
[3:04:20] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Grayhammatter it proves more details does not equal better looking
[3:04:21] <+ahegotrigger> LOL
[3:04:22] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> let me tell you a story about jack and diane, two kids living in the heartland.....buh dup ba da bupLIFE GOES ON!

[3:04:45] <+Grayhammatter> good GOD, that spaghetti hair
[3:04:54] <%Gray_skies1993> Anders is indeed the crucified one outside Cottonwood Cove
[3:04:54] <callsigneagle01> how could Jake Conway be any cheaper?
[3:04:54] <%Shillk> what do you mean proof, caesar hates chems should be known everywhere
[3:04:57] <dekkitout> Show me the Anders-Shaped proof

[3:05:16] <$RubberFistFight> "maybe if you made better drugs, your organs wouldn't fail as they're clearly doing right now, based on your skintone."
[3:05:17] <natebud> Caesar's into homeopathic medicine

[3:11:21] <raven_frame> But Pat got the evidence, what is happening?
[3:11:25] <alexandrecau> go suck caesar's dick and steal his notebook of war crimes
[3:11:26] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat the implications there is that you walked to CC and back twice for nothing
[3:11:27] <+PenmanLupine> this quest is fine if you didn't completely screw things up with Ceasar. then its a lot easier getting the evidence against ceasar
[3:11:28] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat Anders is at the front entrance

[3:11:36] <fluqqer3d> lol
[3:11:36] <KeystoneA1> @SpookySpaghooti Pat killed a bunch of Legion after they gave him the Mark of Caesar on the Strip; that resets your reputation with them to zero. Killing them...well obvious they don't like that.
