Hi Pat, my power just came on after Texas winter-hell and I'm happy to see you're streaming! I actually downloaded the KOTORII VoDs onto my phone before the weather hit, so I'm caught up finally.
[0:12:08] <+popo0129> Is this height difference accurate
[0:12:19] <@PeachSaliva> ye
[0:12:21] <Rhrm> yes
[0:12:22] <%stemlo_> More or less IIRC
[0:12:25] <yorik1> why are cartoon versions of streamers always more flattering in appearance than they actually look irl?
[0:12:38] <@PeachSaliva> Yes we are very sexy here
[0:12:40] <%stemlo_> You think beanpat is more flattering?
[0:12:42] <%stemlo_> Also, rude
[0:12:46] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Glad you're getting along well stemlo!
[0:13:03] <%stemlo_> I still don't have water LMAO

[0:13:12] <yorik1> beanpat is hot as fuck, what are you talking about?
[0:13:14] <%stemlo_> But I got the lightning juice in my walls
[0:13:16] <%coward_man> I always remember thinking Paige was like 6 Foot tall then I learned the truth that Pat is just far shorter than I imagined

[0:16:26] <MayorRev> thats quite a difference
[0:16:31] <yorik1> in blazblue tager could do this in the beginning and they updated the game to make characters farther away
[0:16:40] <OldManDeckardCain> those kotor mods are amazing Kappa
[0:16:40] <%WhereIsWill> big differece
[0:16:43] <%coward_man> that's honestly the filthiest thing I have EVER seen in a fighting game

[0:23:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> nah, they're serious
[0:23:08] <%patriotrenegade> It’s not satire.
[0:23:09] <PinoProxie> no it's formerly part of gawker
[0:23:15] <%valkuma> JEzebel is their Womans Appeal section of Gizmodo
[0:23:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Plates say Chun Li, drop the Benz off
[0:23:39] <PinoProxie> because they have the same parent company now, it's not parody tho
[0:23:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> did oni9n buy Jezebel after Gawker died??
[0:23:45] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I am new to GG should I get a Stick or stay with PS contorller?
[0:23:49] <+oktavia_von> @captain_thickthighs how dare u
[0:23:57] <PinoProxie> KOTAKU blown out
[0:24:02] <%THATGUY_789> it was clearly a troll article
[0:24:04] <%stemlo_> "Jezebel is a US-based website featuring news and cultural commentary geared towards women. It was launched in 2007 by Gawker Media under the editorship of Anna Holmes as a feminist counterpoint to traditional women's magazines. After the breakup of Gawker Media, the site was purchased by Univision Communications and later acquired by G/O Media."
[0:24:14] <%weissguard> Literally use whatever is comfortable
[0:24:26] <%Mrbaconator> i kind of want to get a hit box it looks easier to use
[0:24:26] <%weissguard> Cause you're just throwing money away otherwise
[0:24:37] <+captain_thickthighs> Jezebel sounds like a Mormon pornsite
[0:24:43] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ok thank
[0:24:43] <+deadredeyez> did you see the new fortnite characters
[0:24:43] <%Ynkubus_> And maybe to have funny stick art
[0:24:47] <%coward_man> I got a stick cause it's how I learnt to play in arcades back when they were a thing here in like early 2000's
[0:24:48] <eelektross2k> I love gears of war!!!
[0:24:52] <+Dova573> If I can do Pot comand grab on analog stick, i dont need a fightsctick
[0:24:56] <%patriotrenegade> Wikipedia doesn’t say anything about satire or connections to the Onion.
[0:25:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oof
[0:25:13] <alvaroeltz> im thinking of getting a stick jut because i might be better with a stick than with a keyboard
[0:25:25] <Eger007> @PatStaresAt will you play p5 strikers?
[0:25:43] <bob900000> is the ps4 d pad good enough?
[0:25:53] <+captain_thickthighs> I dunno about sticks cause how long can the last before being obsolete
[0:25:57] <%coward_man> another reason is you first played fighting games in arcades and that's what you know
[0:26:09] <BurdRightsActivist> @bob900000 I don't remember it being Bad.
[0:26:14] <+Dova573> Fuck dpad use analog
[0:26:14] <marvel877> Didn't Woolie get converters for PS2 pads to play on Dreamcast?
[0:26:21] <BurdRightsActivist> You only really notice D-Pads when they're BAD
[0:26:23] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Did you see the new Blasphemous update?
[0:26:23] <+Dova573> I only use dpad in Tekken

[0:26:32] <marvel877> BETTER THAN XBOX DPAD.
[0:26:36] <NitronStreams> i have no idea how people can play on dpad
[0:26:53] <%king_wragles> They're already "obsolete", but that doesn't matter when people just use them for the sake of using them
[0:26:54] <%CapnClassix> DAMN RIGHT I DO
[0:26:56] <+captain_thickthighs> al is
[0:27:04] <%CapnClassix> Elite Dangerous ain't the same without it
[0:27:20] <%coward_man> Star Wars Squadrons uses HOTAS which is genuinely surprising
[0:27:22] <+Stormzcales_Lair> @fellow pad players, look up hori fighting commander. its wit I use
[0:27:25] <BurdRightsActivist> The 50 year old dad who gets a 3090 so he can play flight simulator with his stick from 2001

[0:30:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sounds familiar somehow...
[0:30:00] <%JoshManVGH> Pat shoring up his ego for the flood
[0:30:19] <@commanderclaw> And then they start a fighting game series on youtube
[0:30:27] <penitentpendant> The power of Eternal Spite, turn your friends into Sasuke/Vergil
[0:30:28] <%miguelrod777> 🤔
[0:30:33] <+captain_thickthighs> spend you friendship for ego special
[0:30:53] <%JoshManVGH> "The denial of satisfaction was all to make you stronger"
[0:30:54] <BurdRightsActivist> FF7 is inferior 4Head
[0:31:09] <%THATGUY_789> spite force is very powerful
[0:31:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But that doesn't matter cuz Aerith and Tifa are hot
[0:31:18] <tanarath> ff7's pacing is good.
[0:31:27] <teconsar> ff7 kinda sucke
[0:31:33] <penitentpendant> FF7 or FF7R?
[0:31:39] <%coward_man> FF7 is great and will forever have a place in my heart
[0:31:51] <%coward_man> I fucking cried when FF7R was announced
[0:31:55] <smuggleruncle> people forgot how much anime og ff7 plot was
[0:31:56] <bob900000> unless it gets an awesome remake
[0:31:58] <BurdRightsActivist> FF7 With HD textures is a better remake fan FF7R 4Head
[0:32:06] <%JoshManVGH> That and it's never rereleased without weird sprite work now.
[0:32:08] <tanarath> @penitentpendant both have their merits, R if you HAVE to pick one

[0:34:31] <$HunterWalker23> it's a meme i've been seeing around lately
[0:34:32] <penitentpendant> Swing and a whiff
[0:34:34] <%THATGUY_789> when gravity starts affecting your dog
[0:34:40] <%weissguard> psaDown psaDown psaDown psaDown psaDown
[0:34:43] <+BigDumBeak> bigdum1AAA birds rights!
[0:34:46] <%patriotrenegade> It’s funny to me and that’s what matters.
[0:35:06] <+MrParamedic> tragically new york fires has the best poutine in my city
[0:35:24] <BurdRightsActivist> New York Fries is still pretty good
[0:35:29] <penitentpendant> Huh
[0:35:31] <+captain_thickthighs> whose bagels are better New York's or Montreal's
[0:35:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So hey I legit thought Beaver tail was actually fried Beaver's tail
[0:35:42] <%JoshManVGH> Is New York Fires notoriously bad or something?
[0:35:49] <%AyotoCorp> Sounds like he's already in hell if that's the best poutine
[0:35:53] <+BigDumBeak> I once worked somewhere that made poutin with au jou and it was a travesty
[0:36:05] <%Bailey__gaming> its weird to me that it's pronounced "Puts In" when its spelt "poot een"
[0:36:06] <RickSaintRiot> ain't no CA fires, that's for sure
[0:36:09] <RickSaintRiot> ba dum tss
[0:36:19] <penitentpendant> I live in a small town, I'm excited we have a KFC opening. We've had zero fried chicken places here.
[0:36:19] <+oktavia_von> dunkin donuts or timmys
[0:36:21] <pmda2126> nope
[0:36:22] <ChrisPlaysThing> yup
[0:36:23] <%JoshManVGH> nope
[0:36:23] <$Futurecity10> hate bagels
[0:36:24] <%blaccbird914> no
[0:36:25] <%AyotoCorp> I've had a Montreal and NYC bagel
[0:36:25] <Zetheos> the fuck is a montreal bagel
[0:36:26] <bob900000> nope
[0:36:26] <%miguelrod777> I don't eat bagels
[0:36:28] <%AyotoCorp> I prefer NYC
[0:36:28] <+MrParamedic> no
[0:36:28] <%Zetheos> is that a sex thing
[0:36:30] <+Gamblor69> No
[0:36:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I do live nearby lol
[0:36:35] <+oktavia_von> no
[0:36:36] <RickSaintRiot> Haven't had the pleasure of going to Montreal
[0:36:37] <fredbet96> nah, bagels are overated
[0:36:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> nope
[0:36:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Best bagels, hands down
[0:36:47] <%JoshManVGH> I've heard the legends of the NYC bagle though
[0:36:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Ive seen one
[0:36:48] <+captain_thickthighs> naw I just heard it was a point of conflict
[0:37:00] <%Retinolgaming> Both are great, depends on the place
[0:37:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Bagel Wars
[0:37:12] <pmda2126> this makes me interested to try a Montreal one
[0:37:20] <RickSaintRiot> only bagel in our area any good is Noah's, a NY style
[0:37:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> A fresh bagel out the oven? you'll swoon
[0:37:25] <dukenux> i can believe that
[0:37:31] <+vaderxyz1970> How do you make a bagel different?
[0:37:45] <%TheMattman1313> You mean like a crouton?
[0:37:46] <dukenux> so it wins by barely being a bagel? LUL
[0:37:48] <+captain_thickthighs> best bagel I honest had was at a jewish deli in London
[0:37:49] <%JoshManVGH> That doesn't sound like a bagle anymore
[0:37:49] <penitentpendant> Most bagels I've enjoyed with cream cheese. But I'm not in a place that has 'good bagels' so I'm not going to run a horse in this race.
[0:37:51] <RickSaintRiot> Size, or technique, or ingredients
[0:37:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> There's the honey i nthe water for one
[0:37:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You ever eat a bagel, and it just sits like a rock in your tummy? Feelsbadman
[0:37:58] <+Sendrak70> Keep in mind, Pat eats chocolate in closets. Use your best judgement when taking his advice.
[0:38:07] <dukenux> So it's like a pretzel?
[0:38:10] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[0:38:12] <Link232> That sounds kinda good but not at all a bagel
[0:38:13] <RickSaintRiot> boiled etc.
[0:38:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> New York bagels are boiled first iirc
[0:38:26] <%Retinolgaming> New haven pizza better than NYC though psaSmug
[0:38:33] <+oktavia_von> I had a lady fly in from my jobs corporate and gave us a bag of nyc bagels
[0:38:33] <dukenux> i thought all bagels supposed to be boiled?
[0:38:34] <%JoshManVGH> So it's a low moisture bagel dough. Is it not boiled?
[0:38:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> New york bagels are good because of the dead body water Kappa
[0:38:49] <dukenux> that's what makes them a bagel, and not just a dinner roll with a hole
[0:38:57] <nivlac_555> interesting
[0:39:03] <@commanderclaw> That's provably false, people have done tests
[0:39:03] <anAngryHamster> I just had the nightmare scenario where I peed between the toilet and the lid
[0:39:08] <+mikesapartment> the NY water thing has been debunked
[0:39:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> all those people with chigago overcoats flavoring the water in new york
[0:39:15] <+mikesapartment> same with the pizza
[0:39:15] <dukenux> Magic. Got it.
[0:39:23] <+Caidezes> LUL
[0:39:24] <%AyotoCorp> Because bagel hard
[0:39:24] <@commanderclaw> Time and effort
[0:39:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Cum
[0:39:36] <BurdRightsActivist> Because bagel difficult
[0:39:39] <RickSaintRiot> @Retinolgaming CT? i tried Sally's, thought it was ok. do you have a better recommend?
[0:39:40] <%JoshManVGH> looks like they boil their bagels in water ans malt barley
[0:39:43] <dukenux> What if you make a bagel with Flint tap water? (too soon?)
[0:39:44] <%AyotoCorp> And nobody outside of the NY/Montreal zone can tell if they're eating trash
[0:39:44] <penitentpendant> Bagels by themselves aren't that much of a selling point
[0:39:44] <theredfox930000> let's play strive pa
[0:39:46] <%Zetheos> BAY-GUL
[0:39:47] <KaiserMario> BAGELS WHOOP!
[0:39:47] <%TheMattman1313> The Bagel market is probably smaller than we think.
[0:39:48] <@commanderclaw> Not enough jewish folks probably
[0:39:50] <%JoshManVGH> why montreal usea water and honey
[0:39:54] <%THATGUY_789> sounds like bias
[0:39:55] <%MelBrooksKA> You we told live on podcast that it was complete nonsense months ago @PatStaresAt
[0:39:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I love the bagels here but all the food here is amazing
[0:39:57] <+captain_thickthighs> w
[0:39:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Because my make great when good sells almost as fast?
[0:40:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> why*
[0:40:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> who cares about the
[0:40:08] <+MrParamedic> cuz eat a garbage bagel at timmies its easy
[0:40:08] <penitentpendant> Usually have to be rolled in with other 'pastries'
[0:40:08] <dukenux> @JoshManVGH sounds like malt barley might be the key
[0:40:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> its actually something that is being worked out at my workplace, we're doing a new type a dough from a place in Florida here in Oklahoma and its not turning out the same way it is in Florida
[0:40:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> bagels
[0:40:16] <+captain_thickthighs> we need more jews here our bagels kinda such
[0:40:18] <smuggleruncle> this needs blind test
[0:40:19] <%weissguard> Pork Roll and cheese on a bagel is a big ass selling point
[0:40:23] <%MechArch> pshhh a bagel is a bagel
[0:40:23] <+captain_thickthighs> suck I mean
[0:40:26] <%PanicSwytch> One Guy...Bagels is a huge selling point
[0:40:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Bagels are cream cheese delivery bread
[0:40:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> (the Horah intensifies)
[0:40:39] <%logoth_> getting porked up
[0:40:50] <%weissguard> Nah, it's fine
[0:40:50] <%king_wragles> Listen, don't worry about it
[0:40:52] <%JoshManVGH> @dukenux yeah, the other seema to be conventional oven vs woodfire oven.
[0:40:54] <penitentpendant> Never heard of that before, but I won't contest it
[0:40:55] <RickSaintRiot> @JetpackMcQuack almost all bread-food is food delivery
[0:40:55] <%WhereIsWill> just got back WHAT
[0:40:56] <%XzileGaming> thats not a bagel thats a sandwich
[0:40:58] <+zeraux_> het pat and chat
[0:40:58] <%king_wragles> It's fiinnee
[0:40:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Cream cheese, smoked salmon, red onions and capers
[0:41:00] <+captain_thickthighs> the heretic bagel
[0:41:01] <%Dunmarkh> GIMME THAT BACON BAGEL
[0:41:03] <+zeraux_> hey*
[0:41:03] <marvel877> That don't sound kosher.
[0:41:03] <+megaman_sentinel> it's so wrong
[0:41:03] <%weissguard> So limited.
[0:41:04] <+Gigagoat> pulled pork seems ok
[0:41:04] <%miguelrod777> salmon?
[0:41:04] <%Mrbaconator> put deli meat on a bagle make a sandwich
[0:41:05] <%TheMattman1313> Kolaches rule most of Texas
[0:41:08] <%Zetheos> fuckin' bagel purists up in here
[0:41:08] <$SGrim> Cheese and Pepperoni bagels are solid.
[0:41:10] <bbbbuttts1> The perfected form of a bagle is two slices of cheese in the middle, microwaved for 20 seconds
[0:41:13] <dukenux> that doesnt sound very kosher
[0:41:14] <+zeraux_> cream cheese in sushi.....
[0:41:15] <tanarath> We have a small bagel shop over here & noah's.
[0:41:15] <$Mardonious> nothing wrong with some salami on a bagle
[0:41:16] <+MrParamedic> smoked salmon
[0:41:17] <penitentpendant> @WhereIsWill Discussing the merits of Bagels
[0:41:21] <+MrParamedic> candied salmon
[0:41:21] <%logoth_> bacon egg and cheese on a bagel
[0:41:25] <pmda2126> do good restaurants spread there territory or do bad ones relocate to other places
[0:41:27] <%miguelrod777> THEY ARE GOOD
[0:41:27] <%logoth_> happens all the time in NY
[0:41:27] <$SGrim> HAHAHAH
[0:41:32] <+MrParamedic> Everything bagel is where its at
[0:41:32] <pmda2126> their*
[0:41:33] <%Zetheos> why y'all care so much about bagels
[0:41:33] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[0:41:33] <dukenux> That's just pizza bagels
[0:41:36] <XzileGaming> Blassamiss
[0:41:36] <%WhereIsWill> its like a pizza pat!
[0:41:36] <%PanicSwytch> NO ITS NOT
[0:41:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> How do you feel about bagel BLTs?
[0:41:37] <%CapnClassix> That's just a Bagel Bite
[0:41:37] <+captain_thickthighs> it's sinfully delicious
[0:41:38] <dukenux> never had those?
[0:41:38] <%JoshManVGH> so nyc bagels are beer bagels and montreal bagels are mead bagels.
[0:41:39] <%Zetheos> it's a ring of dough
[0:41:41] <+oktavia_von> prosciutto on a bagel
[0:41:43] <RickSaintRiot> you have angered the Bagel God
[0:41:43] <tanarath> But, given that it's california, it's pretty good
[0:41:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> delicious!
[0:41:44] <nivlac_555> bagels can't blaspheme
[0:41:44] <+Skelegroove> I want to make bagels now

[0:41:52] <%weissguard> It's rather tasty
[0:41:53] <RickSaintRiot> and our Bagel God is a god of vengeance. and horror.
[0:41:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat says it's not Koshure!
[0:41:54] <+Mrbaconator> it's cheese, meat and bread pat

[0:42:05] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Bagel warfare up in here
[0:42:05] <marvel877> "PIZZA'S NOT FOR BREAKFAST!"
[0:42:07] <RickSaintRiot> the Bagel God is an Indian that turns into a wolf.

[0:43:25] <$jtdobyns> What about Bagel Bites? They got pepperoni on them?
[0:43:26] <marvel877> At least you pronounce bagel correctly. Ever hear someone call it Bah-gull?
[0:43:27] <%THATGUY_789> bagel Bougie
[0:43:27] <RickSaintRiot> not even rock sugar. not even brown sugar.
[0:43:30] <%DiscoMatador> Never Forget the MOLD
[0:43:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Just a little hurty sand? Please?" Paige 12/12/2020

[0:43:50] <penitentpendant> I have a "Blunt Palate" so my food opinions are fairly useless to my friends
[0:43:53] <%XzileGaming> i dont like kotor, so ima lurk, have fun all
[0:43:54] <%dekkitout> Not even confectioner's sugar
[0:43:54] <%JoshManVGH> Has there been an explanation behind the "Hurty" in hurty sand?
[0:43:55] <OswaldTheDog> yeah i don’t go to the Mustard Queen for food suggestions tbh
[0:44:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> I managed to get here right as the intro started
[0:44:06] <+oktavia_von> yeast sugar on popcorn
[0:44:08] <RickSaintRiot> As though REGULAR sand didn't hurt
[0:44:08] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @mrparamedic Sometimes I'll fuck around and toss some white vinegar in there.
[0:44:13] <+MrParamedic> crazy talk activate now all bagels are shit
[0:44:20] <+MrParamedic> @NoHoldsBarredProductions thats too much
[0:44:21] <%dekkitout> @JoshManVGH Have you ever straight up ate granulated sugar? Shit hurts yo
[0:44:29] <RickSaintRiot> like oh yeah eating regular sand, that's pleasurable as all hell, but SUGAR? that shit hurts.
[0:44:39] <RickSaintRiot> LUL
[0:44:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just put some fuckin' mac and cheese on that bagel and wash it down with yogurt, I don't give a FUCK.
[0:44:57] <%dekkitout> Like I said confectioner's sugar goes down smooth af
[0:44:58] <%JoshManVGH> @dekkitout I guess I haven't. I've eaten captain crunch so that seems pretty close
[0:44:59] <%PanicSwytch> If ur ever in nyc, go to Pomme frites and Bel Fries for some good poutine
[0:45:19] <+MrParamedic> they dont have poutine in america sorry kid
[0:45:21] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @mrparamedic I'm sorry I ruined our relationship just now 🙏

[0:45:31] <+MrParamedic> @NoHoldsBarredProductions true
[0:45:35] <+zeraux_> actuall mac and cheese on bagel does sound half bad
[0:45:45] <RickSaintRiot> I always cough in the middle of my first bite into a beignet

[0:47:34] <Eger007> шеэы пщщв
[0:47:35] <%king_wragles> Chrome eats RAM
[0:47:41] <%JoshManVGH> Oh, Chromium Edge though, that's an improvement.
[0:47:42] <Eger007> its good
[0:47:44] <+zeraux_> is edge even good?
[0:47:50] <+MrParamedic> its actually not a bad browser anymore, but it still sux
[0:47:53] <alvaroeltz> full turn to the dark side
[0:48:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @captain_thickthighs Look man, I already binge eat on a regular basis, I can't afford the Diabeetus. also I'm kind of evil.
[0:48:10] <%Zetheos> Edge most stable browser confirmed
[0:48:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> Why not Firefox?
[0:48:13] <jimbop444> spam is the devil
[0:48:15] <JetpackMcQuack> un oh
[0:48:16] <%JoshManVGH> Why not Firefox?
[0:48:17] <%WhereIsWill> chrome is so bad with streaming its crazy
[0:48:23] <%dekkitout> Time to shill that Opera GX sponsor?
[0:48:24] <%JoshManVGH> @too_much_nukie Damn beat me to it
[0:48:26] <+MrParamedic> hows your gamer cube holding up?
[0:48:29] <penitentpendant> Fair
[0:48:31] <+zeraux_> why not waterfox?
[0:48:32] <tanarath> Pat using E D G E to improving the program
[0:48:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Chrome has really shat the bed
[0:48:40] <%JoshManVGH> The new edge is built on chrome architecture
[0:48:43] <penitentpendant> New bugs?
[0:48:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> This sounds suspiciously similar to an echo.
[0:48:49] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Chrome knows you're not using it and it's out for revenge
[0:48:50] <+MrParamedic> Opera Gx is where its at
[0:49:00] <tanarath> Pat would need to use a pre-chrome fork of FF/etc.
[0:49:01] <%M4T1A5> Every browser except firefox is just Chrome
[0:49:02] <cyclog> @PatStaresAt I just watched Paige's Dark Souls 1 fight with Sif and jesus christ, that was something. You guys really know how to stream
[0:49:04] <%dekkitout> Edge is pretty low maintenance when you're not using chrome with 7-12 extensions
[0:49:04] <RickSaintRiot> kotor 2 electric boogaloo
[0:49:05] <%THATGUY_789> you have edge a chance, now it's out for blood
[0:49:08] <penitentpendant> It lives!
[0:49:13] <%gitgouda> is he on nar shadaar?
[0:49:15] <jimbop444> the content we crave
[0:49:17] <%JoshManVGH> Don't know if it pulls resources like chrome does though with it's weird instancing of processes.
[0:49:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Time for the Jek Jek Tarr
[0:49:21] <RickSaintRiot> why is "electric boogaloo" a meme sequel anyway
[0:49:28] <tanarath> Everything (opera, FF) uses chrome framework now.
[0:49:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Time for the BEST SECTION of the game.
[0:49:43] <+captain_thickthighs> @garbagequeenellie so due you know the story of Darth plagueis, some said he could will away sugar with the power of the force
[0:49:44] <Vyskus> kill em all kae'ryn
[0:49:44] <RickSaintRiot> ahhh, there was a Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo
[0:49:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Chromium is the open source base that they use, Chrome TM is all Google
[0:50:00] <%logoth_> a tiny net
[0:50:03] <+zeraux_> @PatStaresAt what decor you got in your mind palace
[0:50:05] <%gitgouda> Yes.
[0:50:05] <RickSaintRiot> @PatStaresAt why is it called "Hurty" sand, the people want to know
[0:50:07] <+MrParamedic> what colour of lightsabers are in this game?
[0:50:07] <%baka_sugoi> WEE WOOO
[0:50:10] <%gitgouda> this is the way.
[0:50:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's no other option
[0:50:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @captain_thickthighs Is it possible... to learn this sort of flour power?
[0:50:24] <Vyskus> yaaaaaas murder
[0:50:25] <%JoshManVGH> Murder Building.
[0:50:33] <OswaldTheDog> pat has the queen in his mind palace
[0:50:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> DIOXYCIN
[0:50:45] <%JoshManVGH> Mmmmmmmur mmmmmurduuuuuur
[0:50:47] <RickSaintRiot> quarian, so called because there are 4 of them
[0:50:48] <jimbop444> kill the gas!!
[0:50:54] <penitentpendant> By the power of psychic granny pep talk
[0:50:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Thousands of years later Newt Gunray would try this same plan.
[0:51:02] <RickSaintRiot> Control your breathing to use the HAMON
[0:51:08] <+captain_thickthighs> @garbagequeenellie not from a baker...
[0:51:20] <%logoth_> You mean JEEDAI
[0:51:26] <RickSaintRiot> SENDO LIGHT SIDE OVERDRIVE
[0:51:37] <AMUSERNAME> why did they have to specify that this bar's poison works on SKIN CONTACT LUL
[0:51:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Some jedi also don't need to eat or drink.
[0:51:44] <Vyskus> ok but like didn't they say that the gas got absorbed through your skin too, does the force prevent osmosis
[0:51:48] <+zeraux_> a lightsaber cant deflect a bullet right?
[0:51:52] <%SaiyanShoto> You mean the butt plug
[0:52:12] <RickSaintRiot> it could melt it though
[0:52:17] <+zeraux_> sweet
[0:52:29] <tanarath> baby, no
[0:52:31] <+MrParamedic> throw the binky better!
[0:52:33] <RickSaintRiot> because it's still moving pretty fast, eh?
[0:52:33] <%Dunmarkh> that's what the force is for
[0:52:40] <%Arweynn> the bork plug
[0:52:41] <tanarath> He lost his binky
[0:52:44] <+zeraux_> it would be melted but the trajectory would remain the same
[0:52:47] <%JoshManVGH> @ricksaintriot i does but it dosent sublimate it
[0:52:57] <+captain_thickthighs> why doesn't every o e have a slug thrower, you can make a guy with a pipe and some explosive
[0:52:57] <penitentpendant> Wasn't there a comic panel where a jedi was caught flatfooted by a birdshot shotgun blast?
[0:52:59] <%JoshManVGH> Though if it did that would be awesome
[0:53:01] <fredbet96> yeah but who cares
[0:53:02] <Vyskus> when it comes on down to it, making a tiny physical object hit a dude real fast is still the most effective method
[0:53:02] <$SGrim> @RickSaintRiot ah yes, super-heated liquid metal would be more safe to have violently flying towards you.
[0:53:03] <jimbop444> no
[0:53:03] <%Arweynn> NOT ENOUGH
[0:53:04] <%Mrbaconator> NO
[0:53:06] <%WhereIsWill> nope
[0:53:06] <nivlac_555> yes
[0:53:09] <%maskofmichael> Not enough like a baby
[0:53:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> all dogs and cats are babies
[0:53:12] <+TheotherKristian> Dogs are babies
[0:53:12] <%PanicSwytch> No
[0:53:14] <tanarath> He baby, though
[0:53:14] <+captain_thickthighs> no pat you white it's fine
[0:53:14] <%THATGUY_789> no.not enough
[0:53:17] <%barrakuta371> Yes, but also no
[0:53:18] <viewtifulr> Not enough
[0:53:22] <%dekkitout> No, you just on the white dog owner wave
[0:53:24] <JetpackMcQuack> Not possible
[0:53:24] <penitentpendant> Dat lightning storm
[0:53:29] <%WhereIsWill> so anyways, i started zappin
[0:53:39] <Vyskus> not having force lightning in here is torture
[0:53:39] <+zeraux_> trench gun go chck chck
[0:53:40] <Dragovus> Show them the power of Pasta
[0:53:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kill them all Karen.
[0:53:48] <%Dunmarkh> we fought with honor
[0:53:52] <jimbop444> look out midgets without wepons!!
[0:53:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> I also love using force wave in here.
[0:54:04] <RickSaintRiot> @SGrim It would be if 1) the fluid metal didn't keep its shape and fell apart in the air before reaching you, or 2) you went beyond liquid to gas state.
[0:54:17] <penitentpendant> Set mooks to BLEND
[0:54:24] <RickSaintRiot> but if it don't do that, then yeah, it would be better to dodge or take cover
[0:54:41] <Vyskus> what I wanna know is if each room has different atmospheres why do you have to walk through rooms to get to other rooms
[0:54:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It would honestly take less effort for the Jedi to just block the slug with their hand or dodge it.
[0:54:47] <Dragovus> YEAH DRUGS!
[0:54:47] <+zeraux_> grave robber economy
[0:54:50] <+captain_thickthighs> @jimbop444 so if you give a midget a axe do they evolve into dwarfs
[0:54:52] <%WhereIsWill> no chance
[0:55:27] <Vyskus> I suppose that makes sense
[0:55:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: In the Xbox/PS2 version of this game this area is where the developer testing NPC is hidden. I'm 60% sure he got patched out for this version of the game but if you want to see him you can look up a speedrun of the game.
[0:55:44] <$SGrim> @RickSaintRiot if the light saber were hot enough to turn metal to a gas, it would ignite the atmosphere. Also, if the lightsaber is made of plasma, then it wouldn't have the particle density to disrupt the shape of a metal object.
[0:55:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> BOY HOWDY WAS THIS AREA CUT.
[0:55:50] <jimbop444> @captain_thickthighs yes they absolutely do lol
[0:55:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> it's not super clear how exactly alien breathing works. Like, can they breathe oxygen as well as toxins? and how?
[0:56:05] <+captain_thickthighs> I knew it
[0:56:22] <tanarath> lucas wanted it out by christmas, blame him
[0:56:30] <%shurtal> Shipment of Cocaine covered corn flakes seized in Ohio
[0:56:33] <%walternatorz> imagine running up to a jedi with your fists
[0:56:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @tanarath That's not accurate though
[0:56:45] <Vyskus> I will blame Lucas, I will blame him super hard
[0:56:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Obsidian was offered an extension and they didn't take it.
[0:56:52] <Huntercd> Frosted flakes
[0:57:03] <tanarath> What?
[0:57:06] <+captain_thickthighs> you Ohio coming with ideas
[0:57:10] <%dekkitout> I mean...
[0:57:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Daily reminder that your skin breathes as well as you do. So don't suffocate it w/ paint and shit
[0:57:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Obsidian's management wanted to have the game done with.
[0:57:23] <+TheotherKristian> Fuck You Goerge Lucas, how dare you ruin 1313
[0:57:43] <+zeraux_> any interest in playing republic commando?
[0:57:47] <Djinnazz> But TOYZ
[0:57:56] <+captain_thickthighs> I feel most of Star Wars could of been saved with kicking george out of a room
[0:58:09] <Vyskus> I'm not sure if letting people do whatever in the spirit of freedom is better than being a super prude with the ip like disney is
[0:58:10] <%Taisuru> It's a shame Republic Commando never got its sequel
[0:58:16] <%dekkitout> That man was Todd McFarlane before Todd McFarlane
[0:58:17] <+captain_thickthighs> Commando is good tho
[0:58:22] <tanarath> It's great, you should play it
[0:58:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captain_thickthighs The sequel trilogy caused me to doubt that theory.
[0:58:27] <+TheotherKristian> Play it 4k on the Xbox Juan? is it 4k there?
[0:58:40] <Huntercd> Wasn't there a hot red Twi'lek Sith? How come she's only in those parody movies?
[0:58:40] <+captain_thickthighs> touche'
[0:58:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It all comes down to Project Management. You need to hire folks that are, y'know, competent?
[0:59:02] <%asgard147> Are ya killin' those Jedi son? limesPat
[0:59:03] <+captain_thickthighs> she's from the expanded universe
[0:59:03] <%dekkitout> @Huntercd Talon, she's an EU character
[0:59:26] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab sup gang
[0:59:31] <Vyskus> doesn't the content restoration mod mess with the drop tables a bit too, since there were items that literally only appeared at like level 30
[0:59:42] <penitentpendant> If they do remake these games, I hope they add certain vendors that will have static loot tables so you can't get RNG'd so hard
[0:59:43] <Huntercd> So that's why those movies chose her
[0:59:47] <tanarath> The person hiring them needs to be competent as well.
[0:59:56] <%walternatorz> I just imagine these are alien children Pat is slaughtering.
[1:00:05] <+MrParamedic> why jedi so op?
[1:00:20] <RickSaintRiot> @SGrim that's bull
[1:00:22] <+zeraux_> man why are7/11 brand drinks so damn good
[1:00:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @walternatorz I wish you could kill more children in Star Wars games. Not enough imo
[1:00:34] <Vyskus> jedi is op because of the star wars ttrpg lmao
[1:00:36] <+captain_thickthighs> the light side lit it is
[1:00:53] <%SirGO0SE> GAS
[1:01:02] <jimbop444> @mrparamedic basically space racism
[1:01:06] <Huntercd> Can you claim that Twi'lek?
[1:01:07] <%walternatorz> @GarbageQueenEllie child murder is a hallmark of the star wars franchise
[1:01:23] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! heart2Fighting tansy5Cheer
[1:01:23] <%Taisuru> BZZZT
[1:01:25] <+oktavia_von> wow
[1:01:26] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:01:31] <+zeraux_> small scale genocide
[1:01:42] <penitentpendant> Yeah, that might need a diminishing returns in the remake
[1:01:44] <+captain_thickthighs> you can't be with with out child killing
[1:01:50] <1_Dusk> man, how would you do this without force storm
[1:01:52] <%asgard147> mmmmmmm Fried Scum limesEvil
[1:01:52] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun SirSword
[1:01:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You could say the same thing about every single Yakuza antagonist.
[1:02:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Watching Kiryu destroy 50 men while going "I'LL STOP HIM. 1 ON 1."
[1:02:11] <penitentpendant> Although half the fun of these games are being stupid OP
[1:02:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Force Wave is good too
[1:02:35] <%walternatorz> their plan is to exhaust your blood lust
[1:02:47] <%tinyswampthing> i did this as my first planet and this secttion took me hours
[1:02:52] <+captain_thickthighs> no the force is stem cell magnetism
[1:03:00] <jimbop444> and u don't have magic white blood cells
[1:03:04] <+zeraux_> any benefit to usin just one lightsaber?
[1:03:08] <%Taisuru> They're gonna bury you in corpses like the 40k!
[1:03:23] <jimbop444> no no benefit at all
[1:03:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's also an annoying amount of mines in there.
[1:03:33] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:03:44] <penitentpendant> @captain_thickthighs Still more believable than "Force Impregnation"
[1:03:48] <Captain_Joe1911> sirlSammich ?
[1:04:03] <Huntercd> Knock her up
[1:04:03] <jimbop444> bible shit
[1:04:14] <+zeraux_> force insemination
[1:04:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: all the NPCs in here are the same.
[1:04:24] <%logoth_> psaDogchamp
[1:04:28] <Huntercd> They are space hookers it would be a waste
[1:04:31] <+captain_thickthighs> @penitentpendant I don't want to see force impregnation typed out ever again, that seems like a dark tag
[1:04:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> So if you talk to a different one, they act like you've already talked to them.
[1:04:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> They just copy pasted that Twilek.
[1:05:02] <jimbop444> the dark side of the twitch
[1:05:15] <%walternatorz> good thing murder is the coolest
[1:05:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> time to kill hot lady now.
[1:05:44] <penitentpendant> @captain_thickthighs Definitely an easy concept to misuse
[1:06:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Remember the weird costume Leia wears as a disguise in Episode 6? That's what Ubese ACTUALLY look like.
[1:06:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> The models used in this game are non-canon.
[1:06:21] <RickSaintRiot> lead evaporates at 1750 °C, best I can find. that's not even close to the temp it would require to "ignite" the atmosphere
[1:06:27] <+captain_thickthighs> @penitentpendant it's like the most messed up force skill
[1:07:07] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Mines are free XP
[1:07:24] <%Arweynn> one more body in here
[1:07:26] <penitentpendant> Isn't Jedi Cletus canonically lost somewhere here?
[1:07:30] <tanarath> @ricksaintriot missile bombardment could cause a firestorm
[1:07:54] <%shurtal> is that a mindflayer?
[1:07:58] <%Ipsenscastle> wet-ass quarren
[1:08:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> To this day I don't know what Zez Kai-Ell is doing right now.
[1:08:08] <Huntercd> Can the Wookie get a lightsaber?
[1:08:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> No
[1:08:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hanharr has such a big gay crush on Kaeryn
[1:08:27] <Huntercd> Booo
[1:08:35] <+yulitengou> this guy sounds like hes constantly vomiting
[1:08:41] <penitentpendant> @captain_thickthighs Weirdly, I'd trust the ability less with Jedi than Sith. Sith I could see use as a vile prank. Jedi I could see using it systematically.
[1:08:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hey I've seen this in one of those mangas.
[1:08:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> On the internet.
[1:09:11] <Huntercd> Why does he look so moist?
[1:09:25] <+zeraux_> is the metallica twitch thing the height of irony?
[1:09:29] <+walnutcast> @Huntercd got that WAP
[1:09:40] <Captain_Joe1911> sirlSammich SirSword
[1:09:43] <RickSaintRiot> @tanarath right, but taking out a lightsaber to vaporize lead wouldn't be the same as a nuclear blast; OR if it did, nobody would ever be able to use a lightsaber ever.
[1:09:56] <+captain_thickthighs> @penitentpendant crap that would actually be a dark story point I could see in a book
[1:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Remember Madclaws? Hanharr's one of those
[1:10:09] <tanarath> @zeraux_ Blizzard is licensing their racing music, btw
[1:10:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr is COMPLETELY insane
[1:10:23] <penitentpendant> This duel seems like something the Life Debt would automatically forbid
[1:10:23] <+zeraux_> HAHAHAHA
[1:10:30] <+TheotherKristian> Has anyone become a spite Jedi yet?
[1:10:32] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[1:10:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @penitentpendant that's cuz it is
[1:10:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TheotherKristian Bao-Dur
[1:10:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr is Paige
[1:10:59] <tanarath> So you shouldn't have any in game music yet if you stream their rally racing game
[1:11:02] <%AncelDeLambert> big weapon go big
[1:11:05] <+zeraux_> i really like that blizzard is dying slow
[1:11:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hanharr's view of Life Debts is hella fucked. He views it as a prison sentence.
[1:11:11] <Huntercd> Can't she cancell the life debt?
[1:11:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hanharr having the heavy armor feat is stupid because as a wookie he can't wear armor.
[1:11:23] <%AncelDeLambert> @Huntercd no, she's tried
[1:11:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr is nuts, he won't let it be
[1:11:40] <Huntercd> That's dumb
[1:11:44] <+zeraux_> i wonder what a shaved wookie looks like
[1:11:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> The life debt isn't a magical thing, it's a social construct.
[1:11:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hanharr is just insane.
[1:11:55] <+zeraux_> like those picture of shaved chimps
[1:12:01] <%Ipsenscastle> @zeraux_ Pat
[1:12:09] <+captain_thickthighs> hating being bound by honor is an interesting contradiction
[1:12:10] <%AncelDeLambert> basically what's happening is Hanharr has this insane form of survivor's guilt or something, and WANTS TO DIE
[1:12:10] <+zeraux_> lol
[1:12:13] <LeafarOz> Rip Mira apart
[1:12:18] <%solracc25> Big evil Wooie
[1:12:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hanharr is a big boy.
[1:12:19] <themountaindwarf> any recommendation for dnd games that go to lvl 40
[1:12:24] <%AncelDeLambert> but Hanharr is too big and swole to die, so he's just PISSED as a result
[1:12:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr is desperate for someone to kill him honorably
[1:12:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hanharr's deal is like the opposite of Visas's, in a way
[1:12:45] <Huntercd> Hanharr can kill himself if he wants to die
[1:12:48] <+zeraux_> doom slayer has joined your party
[1:12:52] <RickSaintRiot> lightsabers already melt steel, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.3-1.5k deg C. Lead vaporization is barely above that.
[1:12:55] <%AncelDeLambert> he's basically a pissed off, suicidal Klingon
[1:13:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can only see Wookie Toughness in the feat list.
[1:13:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not the level up screen.
[1:13:26] <%Ipsenscastle> @PatStaresAt I just watched last night's Guilty Gear VOD, congrats on walloping Woolie's asshole
[1:13:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Hanharr is a full-on tank.
[1:13:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @Huntercd oh, have you never met someone who dearly wants to die but is incapable of committing suicide? It's so much more common than you'd hope
[1:13:52] <penitentpendant> @captain_thickthighs A Totalitarian Utilitarian Jedi with that power would make a problematic villain
[1:13:53] <+zeraux_> hanharr has quartosis woven into his fur
[1:14:35] <+captain_thickthighs> @penitentpendant batman beyond did a good job of it
[1:14:41] <Huntercd> Hanharr is fully capable of killing himself those
[1:15:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Every time Pat says 'hella lit' I clap
[1:15:04] <%AncelDeLambert> but he ISN'T, he has to be KILLED
[1:15:12] <RickSaintRiot> i clapped i clapped when he said it
[1:15:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's pretty pog
[1:15:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Too Crazy to Die
[1:15:28] <+zeraux_> sometime when i see pat doing skill management and the like i get flash backs to the dark days of heroes of the storm stream whern he was just buying and opening the loot crates
[1:15:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr is basically Avengers Hulk, he wants to die, but the MONSTER inside him won't let it happen
[1:15:41] <+TheotherKristian> Hey to anyone whose played this, which is the more worth it? Playing this on Xbox XXX or on the PC with Mods?
[1:15:51] <AncelDeLambert> I'm hyping up Hanharr way more than he deserves, btw, he's really just an idiot
[1:15:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Regenerate health could help.
[1:15:54] <RickSaintRiot> man, being the Hoolk would suck if you were suicidal
[1:16:03] <%AncelDeLambert> he's kinda Worf, he was raised fucked up
[1:16:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TheotherKristian PC 100%.
[1:16:05] <+MrParamedic> enjoy the steam homies gotta blast
[1:16:06] <KaiserMario> Do Wookies have retractable dicks, or are they just flopping around the fuzz?
[1:16:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Without TSLRCM the game is markedly worse.
[1:16:20] <RickSaintRiot> wookies lay eggs
[1:16:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @KaiserMario total red rocket
[1:16:32] <+zeraux_> i really dont wanna think about wookie weens
[1:16:41] <KaiserMario> Cool
[1:16:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Hanharr ruined Paige's favorite blanket
[1:16:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wookies probably have dog cocks.
[1:16:52] <+zeraux_> HAHAHAHA
[1:17:03] <KaiserMario> The Wookie lipstick, huh?
[1:17:04] <%AncelDeLambert> bye Moira
[1:17:24] <RickSaintRiot> I have killed her.
[1:17:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I HAVE DEFEATED THE NICE LADY THAT SAVED ME FROM SLAVERY! I WIN!
[1:17:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Byebye hot lady.
[1:17:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I AM THE GREATEST WOOKIE SERIAL KILLER!
[1:17:56] <+Mumbles519> Nooo Mira.
[1:18:08] <RickSaintRiot> You're paying me in dogs! How thoughtful
[1:18:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh shit I've never seen this, I didn't know it was the exact same fight
[1:18:24] <%AncelDeLambert> you could always pause, Pat
[1:18:32] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHA LUL
[1:18:39] <%AncelDeLambert> JAAAAAAAM!
[1:18:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is so shit, I love it
[1:18:43] <penitentpendant> Filter set to Koolaid Man
[1:18:52] <RickSaintRiot> oh YEAH
[1:18:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Feel the power of my STRAWBERRY JAAAAM!
[1:19:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> INFECTED, INFECTED WIT WOT?
[1:19:03] <penitentpendant> Koolaid Vision is GO
[1:19:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Rage
[1:19:09] <+zeraux_> LONE STAR
[1:19:18] <%AncelDeLambert> infected with based
[1:19:35] <%AncelDeLambert> but Pat now you can't walk through mines like a boss
[1:19:41] <RickSaintRiot> Lord Vader we lost the bleeps the sweeps and the creeps
[1:19:44] <+zeraux_> is hanharr taller the zalbaar?
[1:20:01] <%Ipsenscastle> 'alright fuckos, let's get our fuck on' is an incredible battlecry
[1:20:01] <RickSaintRiot> jedi master Zangief
[1:20:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @RickSaintRiot the what? "The what?" "And the what??"
[1:20:07] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You said before that if this game's remake had action style combat it would suck, but what if it went the FF7R style?
[1:20:17] <%Ghufufin> also no Pants!
[1:20:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hot take: FF7R combat sucks.
[1:20:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @KaiserMario I think you could get away with Yakuza7 combat
[1:20:52] <%AncelDeLambert> well... it sucks for Final Fantasy 7
[1:21:00] <KaiserMario> @AncelDeLambert That'd be ok
[1:21:05] <RickSaintRiot> if i had a dime for every time there was a Galaxy Quest or Space Balls ref in our Star Wars ttrpg, lol
[1:21:05] <%AncelDeLambert> if the combat system was for ANY OTHER GAME I'd be hyped for it
[1:21:07] <+captain_thickthighs> also why Tifa not in tekken
[1:21:08] <%Ghufufin> true
[1:21:24] <+zeraux_> which rpg has the best combat in your opinion pat?
[1:21:25] <penitentpendant> @Too_Much_Nukie I feel using items uses too much Action Economy, which makes bad situations worse
[1:21:37] <JetpackMcQuack> It’s pretty
[1:21:45] <KaiserMario> What if it went the FF15 route? oh boy...
[1:21:47] <%Ipsenscastle> I honestly didn't expect to hear Pat come out against FF menu combat
[1:21:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> The action point system in general isn't good.
[1:22:03] <%AncelDeLambert> we're in a fucking Yahtzee Croshaw novel with this visual effect
[1:22:11] <+zeraux_> so whats good rpg combat?
[1:22:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Final Fantasy menu combat is why people who don't play JRPGs think JRPG combat is only about spamming your most powerful attack.
[1:22:20] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt consequence of him being Soldier Class
[1:22:23] <+walnutcast> what do you nerds want ff7r combat to be? LUL
[1:22:25] <+captain_thickthighs> the best turn base type combat is Valkyrie Profile
[1:22:28] <Sunstalker> Forced nudism DansGame
[1:22:34] <RickSaintRiot> unlock chest high wallhacks
[1:22:36] <penitentpendant> @zeraux_ Depends on if you want to go 'action' or 'turn bases'
[1:22:44] <mudapersona> Dragons dogma?
[1:22:49] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, they really should have made a Wookie class so that wouldn't happen
[1:22:52] <+walnutcast> i want FF7 to have NBA 2K combat. let me shoot some hoops
[1:22:53] <+zeraux_> besot of both categories
[1:22:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @walnutcast I want the game to not exist.
[1:22:59] <lets_be_friendos> the worst take is when you say you hate turn based combat but like persona 5
[1:23:06] <+walnutcast> @Too_Much_Nukie that's a neckbeard take tho
[1:23:08] <+zeraux_> best*
[1:23:11] <owazowski> I fucking love dragon's dogma
[1:23:26] <mudapersona> combat is literally the only thing holding that game toegther tbh but i still love it
[1:23:29] <+zeraux_> dragon dogma 2 is never gonna happen
[1:23:37] <rekinom> Just tuned in, why is Pat a wookie?
[1:23:40] <%AncelDeLambert> here's my Persona 5 take: the cover system SUCKS ASS
[1:23:40] <owazowski> I weep
[1:23:46] <+walnutcast> no dragons dogma 2, they're gonna skip straight to 3
[1:23:46] <Laptop711> where is Gief. show the good boy
[1:23:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Traditional JRPG mechanics suck ass. If I see one more classical battle menu, I'm Hanharring myself
[1:23:53] <%asgard147> Wookie Sith limesEvil
[1:23:54] <penitentpendant> @rekinom Dark Side exclusive character
[1:24:02] <Laptop711> hide the red rocket though...
[1:24:10] <%Ghufufin> if you are looking for a an jrpg with more choices, bravely default has a cool spin on it
[1:24:14] <+captain_thickthighs> your a little short to be woolkie
[1:24:17] <RickSaintRiot> favorite jrpg is probably LISA honestly
[1:24:19] <rekinom> Do wookies have red rocket?
[1:24:37] <KaiserMario> I don't think Dragon's Dogma is a good example for RPG combat... norr Elder Scrolls... I think most FFs had good cmbat, Breath of Fire too
[1:24:37] <RickSaintRiot> not quite as good as the Rodian Lifeblade
[1:24:45] <+zeraux_> doesnt bravely default start to suck hard like mid point of the game?
[1:24:45] <Gondor696969> Howdy handsome
[1:24:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean Ludo Kressh is one of the coolest sith lords of all time.
[1:24:54] <+walnutcast> i've become so much happier by not being so critical about video games it's amazing
[1:24:55] <%Ipsenscastle> I wish FF had carried on evolving CTB after X. If they'd implemented a timeline with interruption moves it would have been the best turn based combat system ever
[1:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> here's my theory on turn based combat: it needs to be not all that difficult. It either should be a puzzle, the solution of which trivializes combat, or it needs to be visually appealing and varied
[1:25:45] <%AncelDeLambert> FF7 is all about visually appealing. Combat isn't hard. Paper Mario is all about it being a puzzle, and it isn't hard
[1:25:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's not that the menus themselves are bad, just that after 50 hours of it gives me burnout
[1:25:51] <%Ghufufin> i didnt hate it but i can see why ppl didnt like that part, the ending is cool
[1:25:54] <%AncelDeLambert> hard turn based is a dps race and is BORING AS FUCK
[1:26:06] <+captain_thickthighs> At a certain point turn base just becomes like a board game
[1:26:09] <+walnutcast> is he talking t ous
[1:26:13] <penitentpendant> @AncelDeLambert I'd almost recommend a combo system. Since it otherwise devolves into 'spam most powerful spell'
[1:26:20] <RickSaintRiot> many do suffer from being Menu-Based bullet sponge battles in slo-mo
[1:26:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> I don't agree with hard turn-based being a DPS race.
[1:26:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's more about managing buffs and debuffs.
[1:26:34] <+zeraux_> a combo system like indivisible?
[1:26:46] <KaiserMario> I think about turn based a lot, I think the more hardcore it is on strategy is best, but it would push back most people...
[1:26:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> While paying attention to the enemies' patterns and weaknesses.
[1:26:50] <LeafarOz> corpse nothing
[1:26:59] <AncelDeLambert> @penitentpendant that's why you make it like FF7: just SHITTONS of spells, all of which do enough damage to fuck up the enemy. That way you use what's fun
[1:27:02] <%Ghufufin> i think good jrpg combat is puzzle like the only issue is without some big variance to any enemy or mechanics, it makes any repeat fights feel very "solved"
[1:27:28] <%Ipsenscastle> ^
[1:27:29] <KaitlynnHere> Why does this Wookie have eyeliner on?
[1:27:30] <penitentpendant> @zeraux_ More along the lines that abilities have effects that benefit other abilities, not just juggling
[1:27:33] <%TheMattman1313> Eh it's mostly fine
[1:27:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> You would be correct.
[1:27:34] <+Gespens> looks fine on my end
[1:27:36] <RickSaintRiot> Press X to Win the Fight
[1:27:42] <IminyourBase> nah it looks fine
[1:27:43] <$SGrim> Not really
[1:27:44] <+captain_thickthighs> I watching from my phone so eh
[1:27:46] <%asgard147> it's seems fine
[1:27:47] <%solracc25> yes
[1:27:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ghufufin that's kinda the problem that FF10 has. It has a great early game, but thanks to the sphere grid every fight becomes "solved" and you fall back on spamming Holy
[1:27:52] <RickSaintRiot> yeah, not killing my vid either.
[1:27:52] <IminyourBase> the effect is actual trash and i hate it
[1:27:56] <LeafarOz> ye
[1:27:59] <IminyourBase> buff your wookie and nerf your eyes
[1:28:04] <%AncelDeLambert> this visual effect is awful
[1:28:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> You could focus on getting out of here so you can swap to Karen.
[1:28:29] <+Gespens> this guy make the big number with his bonks
[1:28:30] <faithless_zealot> But Onii-chan, that's blasphemy!
[1:28:36] <penitentpendant> 'Zalbar' keeps coming out, is that a reference to someone?
[1:28:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Karen goes through this area too.
[1:28:52] <penitentpendant> Fair
[1:28:54] <+Gigagoat> hanhar is the new romance interest
[1:29:00] <KaiserMario> You know, there's a boss fight in FF8 (Diablos) that I think it's a good example of a puzzle boss fight
[1:29:07] <RickSaintRiot> in-game every time Hanharr does this, he mentally simulates losing at holochess to an astromech
[1:29:08] <+zeraux_> has pat weighed in on the blasphemous x bloodstained dlc or is that a podcast thing?
[1:29:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's cuz Zaalbarr has literally nothing goin on
[1:29:21] <%Ghufufin> @AncelDeLambert yea i think having a optimal option is bad idea because it makes everyone else feel worse compared to a situationally better option but making that a reality is tricky
[1:29:22] <KaitlynnHere> Same
[1:29:29] <%Retinolgaming> Character writing is much better in 2, world building/setting is better in 1.
[1:29:31] <KaitlynnHere> Better story is KOTOR 2
[1:29:32] <+Bail_Seven> what does reven eat?
[1:29:36] <RickSaintRiot> you beat me at holochess, i'll KILL YOU ALL
[1:29:41] <KaitlynnHere> Better gameplay is KOTOR 1
[1:29:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> KOTOR 1 was very safe, with the exception of the twist.
[1:29:46] <+captain_thickthighs> I don't get the fallout 3 hate the game felt tighter
[1:29:47] <lets_be_friendos> there's a reason why there's a mod to skip paragus
[1:29:52] <%wibbwobbler> that's pretty fair lol
[1:29:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> They sold it on the idea of the morality system.
[1:30:14] <%Ipsenscastle> KOTOR 2 gets love mainly for deconstructing some Star Wars concepts, definitely not for the actual gameplay
[1:30:25] <%Ghufufin> honestly though most RPGs im there for the story more than the gameplay
[1:30:31] <Big_Dream> its a deul blade two haned
[1:30:40] <Big_Dream> its a deul blade two handed
[1:30:40] <penitentpendant> I kind of hope they detach the idea of Light/Dark from Jedi/Sith for a future (Non-MMO) RPG
[1:30:52] <penitentpendant> Though the chance of mainline doing that is LOW
[1:30:54] <%Ghufufin> unlikely
[1:31:12] <+captain_thickthighs> there not that's the main thing
[1:31:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> You didn't actually assemble it.
[1:31:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh wait you did.
[1:31:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Horrry sheeeet
[1:31:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> I NOTICED
[1:31:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Stop selling Ratslayer Pat.
[1:31:45] <RickSaintRiot> rpgs used to deliver higher quality stories than non-rpgs. they've fallen behind in that regard
[1:31:45] <+zeraux_> whats the difference between a stave and a glaive?
[1:31:51] <penitentpendant> Since it's basically 'Good/Evil' and 'Law/Chaos' with a coat of paint slapped on
[1:31:55] <RickSaintRiot> or so goes the argument.
[1:32:00] <tanarath> no
[1:32:01] <%Ghufufin> no str does not affect crit
[1:32:09] <%Ghufufin> its all a factor of feats/ weapon
[1:32:09] <%Ipsenscastle> @penitentpendant yeah the originals didn't make that equivalence, even Palpatine refers to a lightsaber as a 'jedi weapon' in RotJ, implying that Vader could still be considered a Jedi in addition to being aligned with the dark side
[1:32:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @zeraux_ Staves are the plural of staff, they don't have blades attached.
[1:32:34] <tanarath> @patstaresat crit stuff is mods, special attacks, and equipment
[1:32:49] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt And it has Keen, extra crit range
[1:32:54] <+captain_thickthighs> you need the difference for moan line merch and create team so and so
[1:32:58] <KaiserMario> I hate when rpgs can't conciliate story and combat... It's always dumb when you can kill a god-level side-boss, only for your character to be defeated by some rando captain in the story...
[1:33:05] <tanarath> try to get 17-20 range
[1:33:06] <+zeraux_> ah thanks i always that the were the same thing honestly
[1:33:23] <tanarath> then do the crit special
[1:33:38] <RickSaintRiot> he's got that Angry strength
[1:33:40] <penitentpendant> @KaiserMario I can kill this 40 foot god but this wooden door is impossible for me to open
[1:33:40] <+LordSDB> Yeah you have been tkaing 0 damage during the rage
[1:33:46] <%Ghufufin> does wookie rage have damage reduction?
[1:33:59] <+captain_thickthighs> angry gets shit done
[1:34:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Once you activate that door you switch to Karen.
[1:34:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> And she's now in this area.
[1:34:12] <+zeraux_> i know where thats from
[1:34:21] <%Dunmarkh> @Ghufufin probably if it's like d&d rage
[1:34:23] <kadusb> first time dropping by in a KotOR stream, how are yall?
[1:34:26] <RickSaintRiot> it was Hamhock
[1:34:27] <%shurtal> man, and i thouht Dark Souls 2 vingetting was bad
[1:34:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Regular wookie is bad enough
[1:34:38] <KaiserMario> @penitentpendant Oh no, some 10 soldiers are coming this way. Hide! (even though we killed hundreds on the way over no problem)
[1:34:40] <RickSaintRiot> that damnable wookie Hohum!
[1:34:50] <Daxalog> Did you not post this to twitter?
[1:35:01] <RickSaintRiot> when will His/Hers stop foiling my plans
[1:35:04] <Restainly> only 400 viewer wow
[1:35:08] <penitentpendant> @kadusb I'm enjoying the "Koolaid Man" filter
[1:35:19] <%vehementvadr> ka'ren shall soon meet her kevin
[1:35:24] <%Ipsenscastle> @RickSaintRiot are you talking about Hambone?
[1:35:25] <%Ghufufin> turns out its the Wookie Toughness with the damage reduction
[1:35:31] <Big_Dream> you would get +1
[1:35:36] <Big_Dream> instead of 0
[1:35:41] <RickSaintRiot> @Ipsenscastle yes i am talking about Heehoo
[1:35:56] <Restainly> is that a bearded yoda I see on the couch?
[1:36:17] <faithless_zealot> Bress u

[1:36:19] <%kadusb> kadusb subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:36:29] <%Ghufufin> hey @PatStaresAt fun fact Hanhar does more damage based on how many things he kills while in Wookie Rage
[1:36:40] <%kadusb> yaaaay
[1:36:49] <Big_Dream> destory driod
[1:37:30] <%JobbedBone> oh god I remember discussing my build in IRC, I wasn't prepared to feel old today
[1:37:38] <tanarath> Frce resist is baller
[1:37:43] <RickSaintRiot> it's the wookie, sir, Higgsboson, he's unstoppable
[1:37:51] <tanarath> also, force dispel
[1:37:53] <MassConnect> what's IRC
[1:38:03] <KaiserMario> Wookies don't wear clothes right? But can they wear hats? Like a cute little cowboy hat...
[1:38:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt I really think when people told you to use crush opposition they meant force crush.
[1:38:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> And were being stupid.
[1:39:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is restored content btw.
[1:39:22] <$SGrim> Neck
[1:39:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hoo boy it begins
[1:39:33] <penitentpendant> Which combination on Light Side gave the omnibuff?
[1:39:35] <%Ghufufin> HK is the Way
[1:39:43] <RickSaintRiot> on the planet Nar Shaddar rode a Wookie one fine day
[1:39:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's not a combination, Jedi Masters always get Force Enlightenment.
[1:40:00] <%Dunmarkh> isn't atton just not supposed to go down?
[1:40:02] <RickSaintRiot> didn't talk to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
[1:40:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> But you get it toward the end of the game.
[1:40:14] <%Dunmarkh> like he has a passive
[1:40:24] <penitentpendant> @Too_Much_Nukie Noted
[1:40:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt You're gonna want to use some shields. A lot of em
[1:40:55] <%VioletHeart> @Dunmarkh It's more like he won't go down permanently. If he drops to zero HP he'll fall to the floor, but then just get back up again. He did it in that fight.
[1:42:00] <%Dunmarkh> cool
[1:42:06] <faithless_zealot> LUL

[1:43:58] <+alphonseisbest> AHEM HK would PEG U!
[1:43:59] <penitentpendant> Hunter Kisser Droid, he WILL find those lips
[1:44:08] <DublinRage> Pat I just wanna say thanks for raiding GigaBoots last month during their stream of 3rd Birthday. I followed them after watching them suffer through that.
[1:44:17] <%captainpodock> would you take care of HKs floppy disk afterwards?
[1:44:34] <DublinRage> they just got done suffering 18 hours of the "Gex the Gecko" series.
[1:44:44] <%JobbedBone> In this, does upping con give you the hit points you would have gotten on level up retroactively?
[1:44:56] <+captain_thickthighs> we need Hk47 with an AK 47
[1:45:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> @captainpodock I've read that as sloppy disk and now I am confused

[1:46:39] <%UvBenServed> You WILL shoot lightning
[1:46:49] <penitentpendant> They can charge their smart phones without a plug, at least
[1:46:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> I could use the abilty to charge my communicator!
[1:47:09] <%bhp_99> teach one of them heal?
[1:47:24] <%THATGUY_789> 1 lightning please
[1:48:06] <DublinRage> I just pictured "You want a lightning? Come on: Speak!"
[1:49:55] <RickSaintRiot> gee i hope HK-47 doesn't awaken anything within me
[1:50:15] <RickSaintRiot> too late

[1:55:30] <penitentpendant> In many ways, Kreia feels like the second protagonist in Kotor 2. Just not player controlled.

[1:58:30] <%AncelDeLambert> time to ask THE CHAMPION
[1:58:34] <Vyskus> hanharr is surprisingly competent in space tech considering he calls it 'smells'
[1:58:34] <%crazyspartan214> BOOT TO THE HEAD!!
[1:58:45] <%AncelDeLambert> is this guy selling the droid because you killed the mouse?
[1:58:52] <%AncelDeLambert> holy fuck he is
[1:59:21] <RickSaintRiot> i believe boot to the head is a valid Jedi technique
[1:59:21] <Vyskus> didn't pat sell t3 to him
[1:59:28] <penitentpendant> Uh oh, Droidism
[1:59:37] <RickSaintRiot> And one for Jenny and the wimp
[1:59:54] <tanarath> time for darth t3
[1:59:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> At the very least, you can skip all of T3's dialogue.
[2:00:00] <%Monkeyweed21> man this part sucks
[2:00:02] <%JobbedBone> is it droidist if they really don't have etiquette programming? Kappa
[2:00:07] <RickSaintRiot> this guy is just explaining software versions
[2:00:40] <+Martyrlz> @PatStaresAt My friend played this game for the first time recerntly, and he told me around here was in his opinion the worst part
[2:00:51] <+Martyrlz> And yknow I hate this part too
[2:01:05] <RickSaintRiot> Shouldn't you be getting back-
[2:01:25] <RickSaintRiot> "yes i am quite sexy to the lady droids, but that's beside the point"
[2:01:33] <+Dotta5> Which droid will you romance?
[2:01:47] <+Dotta5> C7? C7? or C7?
[2:01:47] <Decahexa> Robot Murder!
[2:01:54] <%JobbedBone> I liked this change of pace, but only because you tend to be so overpowered by the time you get here
[2:01:54] <%solracc25> bid murder
[2:01:56] <RickSaintRiot> bounty hunter droid? more like Booty hunter droid
[2:02:00] <Vyskus> isn't it a little fucked up that everyone in the universe threatens the droids with killing their brain like the *know* that it's essentially murder but they're just fine with it
[2:02:05] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Use the shock arm

[2:02:30] <%solracc25> do it
[2:02:32] <%Arweynn> make sure t3 has his shock arm on it has infinite charges
[2:02:35] <RickSaintRiot> sure but droids ain't people, so it's fine. it's fine. it's fiiiine.
[2:02:35] <+Delenay> still shit hit change
[2:02:35] <+Martyrlz> @PatStaresAt just make sure you give him a decent blaster and some cool droid arms
[2:02:36] <PraiseHemra> no one cares
[2:02:37] <Vyskus> the droids are already extremely limited in options anyway
[2:02:41] <penitentpendant> @Martyrlz In concept, I'm not against party members doing things without the main character. But there needs to be meaningful choices in the sections rather than railroading.
[2:03:05] <+Martyrlz> Uhh before I respond, does pat know this game at all?
[2:03:18] <PraiseHemra> yes
[2:03:19] <+Martyrlz> Dont wanna spoil if thats an issue
[2:03:49] <+Martyrlz> @penitentpendant The issue is more you can do this segment, then do the 3 party member mission
[2:04:01] <+Martyrlz> And you spend like 5 hours without your main character
[2:04:03] <Daxalog> did you feel the weird needle in your eyeball?
[2:04:36] <KaitlynnHere> @patstaresat how many times have you played this game so far?

[2:04:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> T3's seen some shit. He's completely numb.
[2:04:49] <%solracc25> droids do not care
[2:04:51] <%crazyspartan214> T3 is droid. It doesn't have feeling
[2:04:52] <%JobbedBone> :) < t3 after murder
[2:04:55] <+Martyrlz> I mean, I'd feel bad killing R2D2, but a droid being memory wiped every day isnt much of an individual
[2:05:02] <%solracc25> murder
[2:05:29] <Vyskus> a memory wipe is just a micro murder
[2:05:35] <RickSaintRiot> you gotta wipe em regularly so they don't develop feelings and personalities, man
[2:05:42] <RickSaintRiot> it's for their own good, lol
[2:05:52] <penitentpendant> Actual Puzzle time
[2:05:57] <Vyskus> all those tiny murders build up into one big murder
[2:05:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> NICE

[2:31:40] <%Agami23> oh sick. i've always meant to try diablo 2. now i'll have a time limit before i cant anymore
[2:31:43] <%JobbedBone> they claim its the same game under the hood and there will literally be an in game toggle to switch to old graphics
[2:31:56] <%Captainahab_37> I keep forgetting Overwatch 2 is being worked on
[2:32:05] <aeonicvector> cant wait for all the "no it will be fine they outsourced Wh3" people to realize its not the outsourcers who removed the original
[2:32:14] <tanarath> Why shoulf we care, then?
[2:32:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There ya go
[2:32:26] <%Ixiah> mhhh when i think of my old werwolf with tombreaver :I
[2:32:41] <+Sendrak70> From what I saw with Diablo 2 remastered, they didn't make many changes. On top of that, the option to just play the original is there as well.
[2:32:43] <+Rlexp> what planet is pat on now? I don't recognize it
[2:33:00] <triggersqueeze1985> Never played Diablo
[2:33:16] <%Captainahab_37> never thought diablo was that fun tbh
[2:33:18] <aeonicvector> @Sendrak70 right now its available
[2:33:21] <%Ixiah> to be honest, the one problem with diablo 2 was, a lot of classes didnt have a lot of way to deal quickly with a lot of enemys
[2:33:24] <Vyskus> oh no hanharr you got some cherry jello on you
[2:33:40] <triggersqueeze1985> I have played Dante’s inferno sadly
[2:33:49] <aeonicvector> inb4 major change AND cutting the ability to access diablo 2 standard
[2:33:54] <%Ixiah> watch and you have to rebuy the lord of destruction :D
[2:33:57] <Vyskus> ngl that sounded like a fart at first
[2:34:06] <%Captainahab_37> diablo 2 in steam early access

[2:35:46] <%Ixiah> For now LUL
[2:35:48] <%Captainahab_37> is WoW classic screwed up
[2:36:08] <+The_Protagonist> any WoW is screwed up thepro95Heehee
[2:36:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> the only good Blizzard game is Blackthorne
[2:36:25] <%Ixiah> Pat since you like Ace Combat and Goblins, will you check out Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron - Flyboyz Edition ?
[2:36:33] <%JobbedBone> wow I can't wait for my corpse to explode so I can lose all my gear again
[2:36:53] <%Captainahab_37> Ace Combat 7 is fun but I suck ass at it
[2:37:16] <%Captainahab_37> I like the 3ds ace combat so far tho
[2:38:07] <shaq_yaoi> Do you think the empire is strict with minor criminal offences? Like what would happen if a sith lord caught you Jaywalking or having a beer when you are underage? Would he force choke you out or give you a fine?
[2:38:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man that dog snores like my old dog
[2:38:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> now im sad
[2:38:47] <dumahiem> give him a Double Quarter Pounder!
[2:38:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @shaq_yaoi Depends on the Sith. Some are just sadistic assholes with no internal logic.
[2:39:04] <+Delenay> ive got a cat that is just as loud as this dog is right now. but she snores on the floor above me
[2:39:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Metalica being censored due to copywrite is HILARIOUS
[2:39:14] <yorik1> There's no real evidence that the empire actually mistreated anyone to any degree that isn't normal for the typical government
[2:39:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fuck you metalica you made this bullshit possible
[2:39:26] <$SGrim> ZZZ
[2:39:45] <Vyskus> listening to geif snores with nice headphones is wonderful
[2:39:47] <triggersqueeze1985> Tired boy
[2:39:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 in the EU there is but that is no longer cannon
[2:39:52] <%JobbedBone> I kind of feel bad for them yeah, what an insult to cut them off from the audience
[2:40:02] <+The_Protagonist> i thought that was the wookiee making those sounds for a minute
[2:40:02] <%Sasha_conyst> Zangief snores loud. is cute
[2:40:04] <Decahexa> Gief sounds like a lovely chainsaw.
[2:40:14] <Vyskus> and that's not sarcasm I love geif
[2:40:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Grrrrrenado
[2:40:15] <yorik1> we as the viewer know that there are real life evil wizards doing fucked up shit behind the scenes, but most normal people in that world don't know that
[2:40:18] <%vivaldiva> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaBig ZZZ
[2:40:25] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt have you considered starting a GiefSnoresAt ASMR channel?
[2:40:43] <+The_Protagonist> thepro95Heehee
[2:40:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 yeah Jedi are a illusive religious group nobody really knows what they can do its all rumors and stories...like with many places now
[2:41:10] <ichigogamer> niceee!
[2:41:12] <yorik1> most people don't even know who darth vader is, he's a glorified goon
[2:41:22] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ngl the Geif snores are super relaxing
[2:41:26] <+HalcyonNineThousand> so many shots hit the floor
[2:41:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 Oh god there was this one EU comic where someone didn't know who Vader was and was a huge prick to him...
[2:41:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I bet the only reason the Rebellion exists is because they don't wanna pay extra Space Taxes.
[2:41:52] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat where does the empire's wealth come from?
[2:42:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish trading regulation
[2:42:23] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> like do they ever mention anything about the space economy?
[2:42:35] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> so tariffs?
[2:42:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish no
[2:42:52] <yorik1> only the prequels say anything about the space economy
[2:42:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Wait kinda with the Sepridists
[2:43:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SaltkeyAndAckfish iirc most of the time it's like colonial expansionism or some shit
[2:43:15] <abelincoln_catpuncher> SPACE taxes!
[2:43:18] <%JobbedBone> the literary canon (as in Western canon, not canonical) in the star wars universe probably has different tropes than ours, so such plots wouldn't be so obvious.
[2:43:28] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> literally they're funding this enormous capital intensive war a) out of pocket and b) with tariffs.
[2:43:36] <yorik1> the separatists in the prequels were literally pissed off about trade sanctions and tariffs
[2:43:41] <%JobbedBone> Also their society seems to consume less media than ours in general, though at may be an oversight
[2:43:44] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @GarbageQueenEllie wait so natural resources?
[2:43:47] <yorik1> that's what the war in the prequels was about
[2:44:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Yeah, I could see the Sith drilling the fuck out of some worlds and killing ecosystems for $$
[2:44:26] <%JobbedBone> naboo did look pretty abundant
[2:44:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Basically think of this as the Colonial era where each planet is an island and they are trading natural resources
[2:45:14] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no if only you had Moira
[2:45:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Also slavery! When you're "evil" all sorts of economic options open up!
[2:45:31] <%AncelDeLambert> good job Hanharr
[2:45:37] <%AncelDeLambert> just walk STRAIGHT through
[2:45:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sith don't care about money they care about POWER
[2:45:55] <yorik1> there's something about star wars economics that always puzzles me - why are the hutts so rich and how do they keep that wealth?
[2:45:56] <%JobbedBone> oh no we're segueing into a louis ck bit perfectly
[2:46:00] <triggersqueeze1985> The seps were a ploy to thin the Jedi numbers through a quasai war for an excuse to weaponize the republic hence the creation of the clone army and order 66
[2:46:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> They would UTTERLY fuck the economy for their own beniefit
[2:46:35] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i mean sure, that makes sense, but how long is that sustainable?
[2:46:42] <yorik1> like even if their planet is very rich with valuable shit to let them be crime bosses, how do they enforce that law withing their ranks and protect it from outsiders when the're basically obese disabled people??
[2:46:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> If your lucky you got a Palpatine who understand the economy
[2:46:53] <Vyskus> has there ever been a time when the villain made that speech and it was actually tru
[2:47:09] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:47:22] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[2:47:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 Huts are actually kinda strong compared to humans
[2:47:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They should really do a retcon for the Hutts, give them a plausible backstory
[2:47:36] <%Raiden_Breaker> Are mines ever not a pain
[2:47:47] <waywardhavoc> at least you still have the element of suprise
[2:48:12] <yorik1> yeah but how good at fighting could they possibly be?
[2:48:16] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait at some point the empire stops recruiting humans, right? and only use clones
[2:48:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> you don't need to be good at fighting when you've got pigmen to do it for you
[2:48:45] <triggersqueeze1985> Other way around @saltkeyandackfish
[2:48:48] <yorik1> it's the other way around, they eventually stop using clones
[2:48:55] <waywardhavoc> got pranked again
[2:48:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh right
[2:48:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 Well how good at fighting are the average huamns
[2:49:12] <%JobbedBone> @yorik1 theres some weird justification iirc about them being able to reproduce offspring asexually coupled and being almost unkillable allowing them to consolidate power and secrets with no risk
[2:49:13] <yorik1> which is smart because a huge army of genetically identical people is a bad idea
[2:49:25] <yorik1> even if they're badasses
[2:49:32] <%JobbedBone> coupled with being*
[2:49:35] <triggersqueeze1985> Hence order 66
[2:49:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yorik1 they were also suffering all kinds of issues and some enemies of the empire were using biological weapons targeted at them
[2:49:46] <%Dunmarkh> @yorik1 might be handy for organ and blood transplants
[2:49:50] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Imagine the synergy tho
[2:49:53] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @yorik1 not to mention the horrible problems they'd have with inbreeding
[2:50:11] <yorik1> good enough to not get within reach of a hutt's stubby arms and shoot them with a laser beam?
[2:50:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHOS TALKING
[2:50:17] <triggersqueeze1985> The clones are an army of 1 DUDE
[2:50:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Shut. Down. EVERYTHING.
[2:50:24] <augusta_wind> hi paige!
[2:50:38] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> also if they don't have a functioning economy, i.e. the sith selfishly hoard all the wealth, won't there be like no research at all
[2:50:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is dog sleeping
[2:50:53] <%JobbedBone> oh I was talking about hutts not clones
[2:51:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish it would be like modern day dictatorships
[2:51:15] <yorik1> but back to the pig men and the guards and stuff
[2:51:15] <+HalcyonNineThousand> PAIGE PAT KNOCKED OUT THE DOG AND NOW WE’RE BEING HELD HOSTAHE
[2:51:16] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> and assuming only a tiny share of the population has access to education, the empire would be horribly crippled by unemployment
[2:51:23] <+HalcyonNineThousand> oh shit the jig is up
[2:51:27] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc so no research at all?
[2:51:44] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How's Paige? She doing good?
[2:51:45] <yorik1> what's stopping the pig men and all of jabba's posse from just killing jabba and living in his palace and taking his wealth?
[2:51:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Research ONLY what the dictor wants unless it goes against the dictator
[2:52:09] <triggersqueeze1985> The empire ran off of conscription and enslavement
[2:52:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> The only way to rise ranks in the empire was military service
[2:52:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc which is highly unsustainable, consider n korea, which is probably 60 years behind the rest of the world technologically
[2:52:43] <+HalcyonNineThousand> did he just level up for shooting a garbage can?
[2:53:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @triggersqueeze1985 Just like the Romans. Thing is, in addition to being evil, Slavery stifles innovation
[2:53:20] <yorik1> a lot of people say the empire is racist because they only have humans in their ranks but I'd generally say that's a fairly logical and sensible move
[2:53:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish why do you think ships in the OT are more rusty and beaten up looking compared to Prequils
[2:53:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> sorry, OT?
[2:53:53] <triggersqueeze1985> And leads to massive rebellion @garbagequeenellie
[2:53:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Original Trilogy
[2:54:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh right lol
[2:54:18] <+HalcyonNineThousand> get that droid some toilet pper
[2:54:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Prequels - OT - Sequels/Disney
[2:54:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Those codes are in the room Kaeryn was in
[2:55:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> my point is, the empire is likely to collapse by itself due to its endemic issues
[2:55:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've played this part of the game an embarrassing number of times.
[2:55:16] <yorik1> imagine you have to supply a huge galactic army with weapons and armor and shit, if you had to have different weapons and equipment to issue for every 4 armed dude or weird bug man or dude that needs a rebreather to live on most planets that would be a logistic nightmare
[2:55:22] <yorik1> you'd go broke
[2:55:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish yeah, just like tons of dictatorships but as long as the sith have power over the military they'll be in control
[2:55:45] <%afronooch> yeah right there
[2:55:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @yorik1 for sure, imagine the length of the supply lines
[2:55:50] <%mike2hands> woolie practicing vs POT to counter the PAT
[2:55:58] <%augusta_wind> dog tie
[2:56:03] <%augusta_wind> dog time
[2:56:18] <triggersqueeze1985> Press f to dog
[2:56:28] <%coward_man> baby boy want love, not food
[2:56:29] <+HalcyonNineThousand> f
[2:56:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc i mean look at the roman empire, the achaemenid, the assyrian
[2:56:43] <%walternatorz> "free"
[2:56:44] <%coward_man> he knows you gonna wipe his face
[2:56:45] <%Ipsenscastle> slime over here
[2:56:47] <$RealThiele> i must nut father
[2:56:48] <tonfirean> It's free food estate
[2:56:50] <%Movemeister> The dog hungers
[2:56:56] <RickSaintRiot> camera shy
[2:57:10] <%coward_man> gotta try some different things to get him to come for facewipe
[2:57:14] <triggersqueeze1985> Bark
[2:57:38] <%coward_man> he thinks you're gonna wipe his face
[2:57:38] <%augusta_wind> you cannot move gief's mass
[2:57:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Or modern day china, china's economy is literally on the brink of collapse, they ether need to expand which means war, or release power over the markets
[2:57:45] <+HalcyonNineThousand> happy fat
[2:57:46] <%coward_man> da BLEP
[2:57:46] <RickSaintRiot> i thought the characteristic of the new empire was they put more control in the hands of the governors
[2:57:47] <%Ipsenscastle> heave that lump
[2:57:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The giantest of dog
[2:57:51] <+oktavia_von> big boi

[2:58:20] <%BubbaRands> That dog is a hefty chonker
[2:58:25] <%Agami23> i cant wait for him to get so big that he lays on you and you cant get him off of you on stream
[2:58:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc also that type of empire is going to be rife with internal power struggles, which combined with serious discontent among the populace will likely make it short lived
[2:58:33] <a_bad_proof_of_concept> oh look at that good boi
[2:58:34] <+fockniapo> big tongue stick
[2:58:35] <%JobbedBone> I bet hes heavy AND dense
[2:58:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc for sure, hell, you can even consider the soviet union
[2:58:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> He's seriously so big what the fuck
[2:58:54] <%coward_man> damn he must be nearly full size now, he's so CHUNKY
[2:58:54] <%Raiden_Breaker> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp_HF
[2:58:55] <RUDEBEAR> poor doggie
[2:59:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Think about this the Republic lasted for THOUSANDS OF YEARS. the empire is falling apart after 30!
[2:59:11] <RickSaintRiot> dog get big. also pat is bad reference size
[2:59:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Keep in mind, we only have Pat for scale
[2:59:18] <%JobbedBone> aww
[2:59:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> He's probably still growing
[2:59:24] <%walternatorz> he learned it from you
[2:59:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc LUL true
[2:59:35] <%coward_man> @PatStaresAt my Franky when upset sticks his bottom lip out
[2:59:42] <%valkuma> holy moley that dog has gotten FAT
[2:59:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Your pup is becoming more and more pat shaped
[3:00:01] <%Arweynn> the DOGMEAT
[3:00:05] <Badgerconda_> A good meatloaf takes a while
[3:00:07] <%augusta_wind> i hate the way you phrased that
[3:00:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> The only sustainable way to retain power over time is to create a corrupt elite upper class to maintain an illusion of democracy.
[3:00:10] <%JobbedBone> D:
[3:00:11] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> when bol go snip?
[3:00:12] <+stinkyboyinc> the meat....continues
[3:00:12] <%cephalon_nyt> omg
[3:00:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> 9 more months of meat
[3:00:18] <a_bad_proof_of_concept> that is a disturbing way to put it
[3:00:21] <%cephalon_nyt> you'll be able to get a saddle for him at that rate
[3:00:25] <%BubbaRands> 9 meaty months
[3:00:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt WE NEED YOU TO DO THE TEST OF STRENGHT
[3:00:33] <%valkuma> this planet isnt even a planet

[3:00:38] <%valkuma> thats how much of a sucky planet it is
[3:00:50] <%walternatorz> the planet is doing its best
[3:01:06] <%Ipsenscastle> a lot of these levels are pretty terribly designed
[3:01:11] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @GarbageQueenEllie ironically, i think it's more sustainable to establish a monarcy ruling by fear and religion
[3:01:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageQueenEllie They "Fortify" democracy
[3:01:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> chat why do i recognize that guys voice

[3:04:04] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> who funds the jedi?
[3:04:07] <yorik1> guys the other day I remembered that thing in mvc2 where duc and some other west cost players made a video making fun of clockwork and justin wong and stuff, and they went hard dissing them, and after that clockwork bodied him with no remorse in a grudge match
[3:04:11] <RickSaintRiot> much better phrasing than my version
[3:04:14] <yorik1> does that video still exist on youtube?
[3:04:18] <yorik1> I can't find it
[3:04:20] <%valkuma> Its an 8th level spell so its pretty strong
[3:04:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish They are FUTURE SEEING MONKS
[3:04:30] <%Pappajimbo> its in 5e You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren’t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical plants in the area that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
[3:04:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @SaltkeyAndAckfish That is a good question. I wonder how they built all the stuff they do.
[3:04:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @doc_ock_rokc LUL as a side-gig they work as fortune tellers
[3:05:02] <%JobbedBone> AND you can cast it from 150 feet?
[3:05:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SaltkeyAndAckfish or play the stock market
[3:05:06] <%vehementvadr> the Karen thing to do
[3:05:07] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> also EMPIRE STONKS
[3:05:23] <%vehementvadr> even you are losing control of her pat
[3:05:25] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> "To the moon" gets a whole nother meaning
[3:05:28] <Vyskus> wilting curse is what whiskey does to my dick
[3:05:30] <%CatastropheCorvid> IWD2 is also good.
[3:05:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Also its kinda implied they get payed for deplomacy stuff
[3:05:33] <Vyskus> HEYO

[3:05:48] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Minsc and Boo are the best
[3:05:48] <AzureGale> Obv
[3:05:49] <%Movemeister> Kabloey
[3:05:52] <aeonicvector> heard 2s good, idk about 1
[3:05:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Bruh, I G0-TO even a real person? We only ever see him through holograms. I think he might be an AI.
[3:05:57] <RickSaintRiot> play Icewind Chip first
[3:05:57] <yorik1> the jedi are funded by the diplomatic work that they do, centuries of ancient relics and records and gold and shit
[3:06:06] <MassConnect> not gonna lie I'm so bored I'm gonna watch everything
[3:06:14] <RickSaintRiot> jedi subsist on donations
[3:06:20] <Vyskus> @garbagequeenellie :)
[3:06:28] <Captain_Joe1911> sirlSammich ?
[3:06:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @yorik1 "Gimme your Jedi Gold, KYLE!"
[3:06:42] <RickSaintRiot> remember to like subscribe and donate to the Jedi Master's patreon
[3:06:45] <%valkuma> Obi Wan: I'm once again saying, You prefer to give us your financial support
[3:06:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fat droid
[3:06:58] <%JobbedBone> Are there any good combination RPG + RTS games like Warlords Battlecry III? Its so fun and I can't find anything else like it BibleThump
[3:06:59] <yorik1> I think they get fees for mediating diplomatic disputes and stuff
[3:07:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHAME THE PAT SHAPED DROID
[3:07:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @valkuma LUL
[3:07:27] <RickSaintRiot> nice work Mr. Negotiator
[3:07:51] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @yorik1 i mean have you seen how big their institution is? i would accept if they collected tithes, but like just fees?
[3:07:57] <RickSaintRiot> if only jedi had Megadeuses
[3:07:58] <%JobbedBone> like it has an even more fun and in depth hero unit system than war3, and you retain them between fights
[3:08:02] <yorik1> like they send dudes on space ships to remote planets for bargaining and negotiating deals and stuff, that shit doesn't pay for itself
[3:08:11] <%Ipsenscastle> David Crosby?
[3:08:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are jedi a religion
[3:08:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do they pay taxes?
[3:08:23] <gallohuegos> yes
[3:08:26] <RickSaintRiot> Yeah, I wonder what the rent on that Coruscant temple is
[3:08:28] <%Nekros4442> People pay taxes to the Jedi
[3:08:29] <AzureGale> Hawt
[3:08:30] <%JobbedBone> taxes to who
[3:08:32] <%valkuma> your face is growing scales are sith just secret dragons
[3:08:32] <RickSaintRiot> do you think they own it
[3:08:33] <%Undenizen> drink
[3:08:34] <%Dunmarkh> Yo it's Lynch from kane and lycnh
[3:08:36] <yorik1> do they LOOK like they pay taxes?
[3:08:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I would buy it if the Republic funded the Jedi w/ taxes and they ran like the Scientologists
[3:08:40] <RickSaintRiot> do Jedi own more properties? do they RENT??
[3:08:43] <%MidnightBurst12> @doc_ock_rokc yes and probably not
[3:09:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Ipsenscastle You're not wrong lol
[3:09:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do jedi just use government buildings?
[3:09:09] <yorik1> jedi as part of their code technically don't own anything but their clothes and their lightsabers
[3:09:22] <yorik1> their wealth is a collective that they share
[3:09:26] <%Puhff> Fellas is it gay to use the Force?
[3:09:44] <RickSaintRiot> real monasteries are often run the same way
[3:09:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @yorik1 just like the pope Kappa
[3:09:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Puhff depends did the hilts of the sabers touch?
[3:09:55] <%CapnClassix> Jedi Master BoJemkins
[3:09:56] <thepeacemain> Jedi Mast Hulk Hogan
[3:09:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He looks like a shitter Harry DuBois
[3:10:03] <RickSaintRiot> or real monasteries
[3:10:04] <%TheMattman1313> Don't forget his sick earrings
[3:10:08] <%walternatorz> he had to go undercover, it's the perfect disguise
[3:10:10] <%Ipsenscastle> I could believe David Crosby was a Jedi to be fair
[3:10:12] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @RickSaintRiot the church owns a shit-ton of land, they rent it out
[3:10:23] <%snow_bush> Look, not even the force can stop a receding hairline.
[3:10:33] <RickSaintRiot> yes, as well they should
[3:10:48] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> plus people give them tons of stuff when they die
[3:10:49] <+SilverDevilfish> Force Rogaine leads to the dark side
[3:10:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Guys. The Jedi Order is legit the Vatican. You know what that means...
[3:10:53] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat you still have enough hair left to achieve this look
[3:10:56] <%JobbedBone> the more I hear about the logistics of star wars the more naive it feels. I miss everything being vague enough to trust.
[3:11:14] <yorik1> hide your younglings
[3:11:23] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @GarbageQueenEllie yes, who knows what goes on behidn those walls
[3:11:26] <%dekkitout> Oh he's at Jedi Joe Exotic
[3:11:49] <triggersqueeze1985> Guess what motherfuckers
[3:11:59] <yorik1> "listen up, you motherfuckers!"
[3:12:01] <Jonny_Uppercut> Oh my god he also has ear rings
[3:12:27] <triggersqueeze1985> Space tiger king
[3:12:48] <RickSaintRiot> I'm just wondering who owns most of the property in a megapolis like Coruscant
[3:13:18] <yorik1> years later bioware would go on to use this exact plot device of cutting people off from their soul in dragon age
[3:13:22] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @RickSaintRiot i'm guessing characters similar to the hutt in 2?
[3:13:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RickSaintRiot MEGA-LANDLORDS
[3:13:28] <RickSaintRiot> is it run by the Senate, like DC is run by Congress?
[3:13:30] <%Puhff> This VA is trash
[3:13:56] <%Agami23> this guy doesent seem that bad
[3:14:06] <yorik1> coruscant is 100% DC, crime and homelessness and all
[3:14:11] <RickSaintRiot> do you have to get permits to build on top of someone else's property
[3:14:11] <yorik1> and drugs
[3:14:22] <%Dunmarkh> yeah he seems fairly useful and reasonable
[3:14:27] <RickSaintRiot> they must sell it by layers
[3:14:32] <%Dunmarkh> feb 20
[3:14:54] <%JobbedBone> I love Czerka for some reason. The corporate stuff just works.
[3:14:57] <RickSaintRiot> or have they reached the limit of city building on that planet?
[3:14:59] <yorik1> I think the voice actor is fine but he doesn't fit this character
[3:15:17] <triggersqueeze1985> Horse dog pat ride him into battle
[3:15:21] <RickSaintRiot> yeah the VA is decent, it's just weird seeing it come out of this Space Trucker
[3:15:29] <%augusta_wind> i feel like i'm listening to a college lecture
[3:15:45] <yorik1> this guy looks like a farmer but is actually a wise warrior monk
[3:15:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Get fuckin owned
[3:15:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RickSaintRiot they can just keep sticking more levels on top, It's already city all the way down to the core
[3:15:58] <%Movemeister> Spacebound and down over here ain’t too bad
[3:16:01] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait why is the space trucker's lightsaber reD?
[3:16:16] <%JobbedBone> when the buffs take longer than the fights LUL
[3:16:31] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, for Sith Kreia teaches you the form MID FIGHT?
[3:16:33] <%Dunmarkh> @SaltkeyAndAckfish it's not
[3:16:39] <%AncelDeLambert> this is dumb as hell
[3:16:44] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh it's purple LUL
[3:16:51] <%AncelDeLambert> omg the boxes are talking to you!!!
[3:16:51] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> sorry, my laptop's in night mode
[3:16:59] <%AncelDeLambert> GET OUT OF MY MIND, BOX!
[3:16:59] <yorik1> is it possible to beat this game without becoming a jedi? or without using a lightsaber?
[3:17:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just like Bastila woulda done
[3:17:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt sabre form
[3:17:40] <RickSaintRiot> every new addition of mass must raise the gravity towards the center slightly.
[3:18:00] <%AncelDeLambert> @yorik1 you start 2 as one
[3:18:05] <%MidnightBurst12> CONSUME
[3:18:20] <+cafefunk> where are your party members
[3:18:20] <%cvp5127> vored
[3:18:25] <%AncelDeLambert> you never need to use a lightsaber, but it's better than any other weapon when you get right down to it
[3:18:32] <%crazyspartan214> his mullet will be miss
[3:18:34] <%JobbedBone> tone ruined LUL
[3:18:36] <%Movemeister> Shocked him with them titties
[3:18:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RickSaintRiot Yeah but it's Star Wars so who give a shit about gravity
[3:18:41] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @RickSaintRiot true, presumably the mass comes from other planets
[3:18:43] <%MidnightBurst12> prey slaughtered
[3:18:45] <yorik1> building more buildings on a planet doesn't increase the mass of the planet
[3:19:00] <RickSaintRiot> but the core of Coruscant itself would have very little gravity, would be funny to live down there
[3:19:23] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @ReallyBigRocks i mean when they absorb planets and stars the whole solar system should come crashing down
[3:19:23] <$jtdobyns> Hope he does not forget the Mandos there.
[3:19:38] <%JobbedBone> "look, hes floating around like a poor person"
[3:19:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RickSaintRiot I think the core levels is basically all power generation and industrial shit
[3:20:12] <%AncelDeLambert> there's Mandos in the apartments
[3:20:22] <%AncelDeLambert> don't remember what their quest is, tho
[3:20:26] <RickSaintRiot> @ReallyBigRocks makes sense, but it would have to travel a long way to get to the surface, no?
[3:20:35] <RickSaintRiot> idk if their power generates heat or not
[3:20:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> POOOOWAHHH
[3:20:39] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> how much are they able to use the forcE?
[3:20:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is it an infinite resource?
[3:20:51] <$jtdobyns> @AncelDeLambert It is for Cando.. Gotta have him in the party.
[3:21:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RickSaintRiot Again, it's Star Wars so don't think too much about it
[3:21:10] <RickSaintRiot> i think the Force is basically infinite if you pull it from the world around it
[3:21:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Science Fantasy not Science Fiction
[3:21:17] <AzureGale> KILLED EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
[3:21:22] <RickSaintRiot> yeah SW wasn't meant to be fleshed out in any great detail
[3:21:22] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta bring cando to the mandos for his big plando
[3:21:40] <+shadic7700> The woman and the children too
[3:21:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Droid is ORB
[3:21:47] <triggersqueeze1985> The women and the children 2
[3:21:48] <yorik1> the force is literally infinite
[3:21:59] <+Gamblor69> Are you saying Huzzah a lot because of those rotoscoped RPG videos? Coz I have been doing that too
[3:22:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> uh why do the droids have opinions
[3:22:13] <triggersqueeze1985> I HATE THEM
[3:22:16] <%JobbedBone> the black one isn't a droid
[3:22:19] <%JobbedBone> its like cait sith
[3:22:19] <RickSaintRiot> if there's something finite about the Force, it's probably a being's ability to wield it.
[3:22:22] <+Gamblor69> I love those vids
[3:22:27] <RickSaintRiot> or "tap into" it
[3:22:28] <yorik1> a murder most foul
[3:22:28] <%AncelDeLambert> rotoscoped what now?
[3:22:30] <+shadic7700> He FAT
[3:22:33] <%AncelDeLambert> have I missed Joel content?
[3:22:34] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:22:38] <%Pappajimbo> Adventure Awaits!
[3:22:42] <+Gamblor69> Also been saying depressed 'fuck' a lot
[3:22:50] <%Movemeister> Those are great tbf
[3:23:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Kreia sneering at Atton is always the best
[3:23:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> <3
[3:23:12] <%gitgouda> kill him kreia!
[3:23:18] <RickSaintRiot> held her by the tits- i mean throat
[3:23:46] <Jonny_Uppercut> Pat I recently binged all of RLM's BotW for the first time, is it a compliment to tell you that Rich Evans reminded me of you?
[3:23:49] <+shadic7700> Yeah now your a bag of sand granny!!
[3:23:59] <+projectmanatees> kriea hair peices just look like scrunchies
[3:24:03] <yorik1> those videos resonate with me because I've played so many RPGs where I did what I thought was a perfectly reasonable thing to do and the game throws bullshit consequences at you
[3:24:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @Jonny_Uppercut yes
[3:24:11] <RickSaintRiot> i can't think of anything LESS of a compliment LUL LUL
[3:24:18] <yorik1> and it's like, how the fuck could I have possibly known that would happen?
[3:24:20] <%gitgouda> cause shes awesome
[3:24:22] <RUDEBEAR> she a real b word
[3:24:22] <%emperordread> Told.
[3:24:31] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @RickSaintRiot fair, but does that mean that the sith can act as infinite power generators?
[3:24:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Torture my brain MORE Kreia
[3:24:41] <Big_Dream> Kreya = karen
[3:24:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Fight her for the position of alpha karen
[3:24:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> by say force pushing a turbine forever
[3:24:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> dang my flatmate has torrents on blast rn
[3:24:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige is SUPER hot for Rich Evans, so saying Pat reminds you of him is no issue
[3:25:13] <+shadic7700> Can’t wait to vore Kriea and show her who’s boss
[3:25:16] <yorik1> it literally could
[3:25:40] <yorik1> the turbine doesn't care that it's not being pushed by wind or steam or whatever, anything turning it will generate power
[3:25:48] <%JobbedBone> "You think he'd do it twice?" Is the best line in those
[3:26:18] <%gitgouda> do kreia and visas have special vision like a droid?
[3:26:19] <%Xevtes> Xevtes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Pat & Paige! Thanks for all the fun. Why are people hating your dog talk on the podcast/stream, and telling you how to run your stuff? If Woolie said something, that would be different. They need to chill out or leave if they don't like it.
[3:26:20] <BraxtonSwine> that's the same as your story line :)
[3:26:21] <Jonny_Uppercut> @AncelDeLambert Duly noted flaveSMUG
[3:26:55] <triggersqueeze1985> Chundarr was an evil Wookiee in 1 it’s not new
[3:27:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think using the force requires some level of exertion from the person using it judging by how many times people collapse after doing crazy force shit, so while the force is infinite, peoples ability to use it isn't
[3:27:21] <%gitgouda> lul wut

[3:31:10] <yorik1> what disney should really do is cancel all the bullshit disney plus shows they announced except for obi wan and use that money to make a show about the jedi mandalorian wars
