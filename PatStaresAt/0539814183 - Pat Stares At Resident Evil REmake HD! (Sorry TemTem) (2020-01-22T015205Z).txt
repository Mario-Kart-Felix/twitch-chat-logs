[0:12:57] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Been watching the CVX archives past the parts i left during; in watching, i can't help bit notice the weird corollaries between it and what would eventually become RE4; with it's weird emphasis on military bases, weird weapon balancing and a clear push for a more action movie type feel, could it be that RE4 was born from the problems with CVX having an ambition to be an action oriented game with a design still rooted in survival horror causing a styles clash?
[0:12:58] <%Dragon_Batman> It's not the spirit of what he is doing but it would be kool to see a Wesker run of RE0

[0:42:23] <ShichiNoBushi> Arachnophobes can open their eyes now.
[0:42:23] <%President_Miyazaki> Man, I know that the company hired to design the manner was supposed to make it puzzley and shit, but having a tombstone of a dude describing how the people brought his family there to kill them be a secret passage seems fucked.
[0:42:23] <%ha2ken> No spider warning...RIP arachnophobes
[0:42:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap

[0:42:52] <%natebud> fuck gone
[0:42:55] <%Dragon_Batman> In the words of Simmons, "Let's Fuck him!"
[0:42:57] <%thebeargoesHONK> Is everyone else enjoying this session of crap games done slow
[0:43:02] <%SixxMakaveli> Do yall really want a spider in the new Engine. Not Me.
[0:43:06] <%necrocannibal2> this game is awesome, though
[0:43:07] <%SolverCODO> OwO
[0:43:09] <Ner234> @SoFarFetched So can it kill you or just take you to near death?
[0:43:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> Zapping System
[0:43:13] <dreu81> doodSprinkle doodSprinkle
[0:43:17] <+DashXero> Man... It sucks to think that somewhere in the RE world there were human-sized spiders. And nobody shot them.
[0:43:19] <heartlesshealer> daggers already making me miss the code veronica knife
[0:43:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Spiders are our friends
[0:43:21] <majima666> i do, its a horror game. i want to hate it lol
[0:43:23] <%Grayhammatter> spiders
[0:43:24] <SheefEatsBeef> monkey s
[0:43:28] <%Frostydough1> These speedruns strats get more complicated veryday
[0:43:33] <Starshield1918> hunters are easier in this version
[0:43:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> don't censor the spiders
[0:43:37] <dreu81> spiders > centipedes
[0:43:42] <%DappercatEsquire> Did they ever explain why the spider just increased in size but didn't become all fucked up?
[0:43:53] <misterspotswood> cuz spiders are already icky
[0:43:54] <DandyMackeroos> Lickers kind of filled out what the Spiders would do in REmake 2
[0:43:55] <rytisone> everything's coming up Jillhouse
[0:43:56] <%SoFarFetched> @Ner234 Yeah depending where your health is at when you get poisoned,you keep losing health until you die. You can use a red+green herb,but you will still be poisoned. Just takes longer to kill you.
[0:43:56] <%spongeofmystery> RE0 explains why
[0:43:57] <trashcansan> centipedes can go. spiders can stay
[0:43:58] <%Soaked_Circuits> !uptime
[0:43:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 44m.
[0:43:59] <%Grayhammatter> i fully expect it
[0:44:01] <Starshield1918> oh shit, your health
[0:44:06] <%Rotanimood> Spiders > wasps
[0:44:07] <%natebud> Not if you use the magnum you coward
[0:44:08] <SheefEatsBeef> nah ur fine :)
[0:44:08] <%Hilleltaco> like in real life or
[0:44:09] <+DashXero> Spiders are arthropods. The T-Virus probably affects them differently.
[0:44:11] <%Dragon_Batman> Thinking about it the Chimera and the brain sucker enemies are gonna be nightmare fuel in Remake 3 huh?
[0:44:11] <+Mitchellsocks> You may die. Aquemini
[0:44:12] <Neo_Kaiser> Oh no! The Australian emergency broadcast said we're getting attacked by Squall!
[0:44:13] <%kingbaconcrispy> You should have taken the elevator
[0:44:14] <%Teintstein> so long as it teaches us a lesson
[0:44:16] <majima666> i dont mind house spiders. they eat all the other bugs
[0:44:17] <Ner234> @SoFarFetched Ah, I see. Thanks.
[0:44:17] <%arcaderabbit48> @DappercatEsquire The various viruses work on animals in strange ways. Yawn is another example, as are many RE0 enemies
[0:44:18] <%TheSphereHunter> THIS HALL'S DANGEROUS!
[0:44:18] <+The_H1R0> @DappercatEsquire Because spiders are already one of natures most fucked up designs naturally.
[0:44:21] <%the_vedo_show> NAISU
[0:44:21] <rytisone> reset

[0:44:32] <+king_trito> Pat the absolute beast huggDrew
[0:44:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> acid rounds dont shoot far

[0:44:48] <%kingbaconcrispy> Windows
[0:44:48] <%cdrom321> @spongeofmystery Yes. All of RE0 and its bosses that are just larger versions of animals.
[0:44:48] <%D3rrtyD4n> flame rounds go a bit further
[0:44:49] <%natebud> If you had one mellow yellow shot
[0:44:51] <tank7013> Oh, range LUL . I thought the animation had given him armor
[0:44:52] <%Criox1388> God the lighting is so good in this game
[0:44:58] <+TardyClock> Why sorry TemTem? Were there plans to play it?
[0:44:59] <%DappercatEsquire> Because maybe it could revolutionize the lobster meat game.
[0:44:59] <HefestoForges> rip
[0:45:00] <%President_Miyazaki> Remember the giant tics in RE Outbreak called Mega Bites and Giga Bites?
[0:45:03] <Glass_Muffin> @AngriestPat Hello hope youre havin a good day
[0:45:08] <corepercentlives> some camera angles in this game oh boy
[0:45:08] <dreu81> Pat why does this game look so good?
[0:45:11] <%Alpha8087> I am so startled.
[0:45:16] <%kingbaconcrispy> They only come in through the other side. Oh well

[0:45:29] <%natebud> Magnum some hunters you coward
[0:45:31] <Ner234> @TardyClock There was yeah. But TemTem servers are dying so he cancelled
[0:45:35] <lionandfox21> @DappercatEsquire There is a file in this game or RE0 that basically says that arthropods will undergo a increase in size and aggression but there is no significant improvement to their intelligence
[0:45:38] <%Solidnick18> looking good
[0:45:38] <%scaryboisupreme> I hope they bring the giant spoders back in RE3
[0:45:38] <Starshield1918> did you use up the balcony herbs yet?
[0:45:40] <KishinGrek> Hey Pat, went to PAX SOUTH, saw a really badass horror RPG, that looks like a Junji Ito manga, Called World of Horror, i highly recommend it when it hits steam/PD4
[0:45:47] <%D3rrtyD4n> puzzle time
[0:45:48] <%BayowolfTerra> Fav safe room music? Mines og 2
[0:45:50] <%SoFarFetched> Funny thing is I got a friend playing temtem right now LUL I wonder how that stream is going.

[0:46:21] <+The_H1R0> At this point in the timeline did Albert start doing self-mutating experimentation and needed the sunglasses for his red eyes, or is he just a douche?

[0:46:32] <dukenux> why is the bird creepin at you
[0:46:33] <%SoFarFetched> @superb_superbia think he started maybe 10 minutes ago or so?
[0:46:33] <%CalderGaming> @dreu81 prerendered backgrounds mean you can make stuff way prettier than what the original hardware could render, plus pat's using an HD texture mod
[0:46:38] <%BayowolfTerra> Douche
[0:46:38] <%kingbaconcrispy> Eat less, watch more stream.
[0:46:39] <%ha2ken> That bird works for Umbrella

[0:47:02] <KishinGrek> Bird, birdy birdy birdy
[0:47:03] <%Jane_Lo> @The_H1R0 it's kind of both? remake doesn't show that he injects some stuff, but umbrella chronicles do fix that
[0:47:04] <MachineHead9> @The_H1R0 just a douche but he was an experiment himself

[0:47:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> But where's that damn fourth one?

[0:50:50] <lionandfox21> @Monkeyweed21 RE1 is basically Wesker's stupid plan, Umbrella I believe does actually use their soldiers, the UBCS in RE3 are an examlpe
[0:50:51] <%bluebiscuit94> So it's a mutant disk?
[0:50:51] <Tersalus> This is such a crazy man o' th' shin!
[0:50:52] <%Solidnick18> Mo disk Mo problems
[0:50:52] <+Estuko> @DashXero MacrO, holds all the Fox x Falco Macro porn that guy commissioned.

[0:50:56] <%necrocannibal2> FUCK THE GAMECUBE
[0:50:58] <%Conyst> you have to get the Larrydisc and curlydisc to find out what the modisc does
[0:50:59] <KishinGrek> How does it work?
[0:51:09] <%necrocannibal2> since we're talking about tiny disks
[0:51:09] <+AXL808> ah, to enjoy the amount of money to build a stupid, puzzle mansion just because you like spy stories
[0:51:11] <FirearmsInstructor> WAIT! MAGNETS CAN'T SEE!!!?
[0:51:13] <%necrocannibal2> THE GAMECUBE SUCKS
[0:51:15] <%JJCheeker> I love that the door just falls off
[0:51:16] <%spongeofmystery> How many of you are able to draw a map of the Spencer Estate from memory?
[0:51:22] <Starshield1918> Yeah, I think you're right, at least in Remake
[0:51:24] <MachineHead9> damn zooomers don't know what a disk is now
[0:51:25] <%crimsonharvest> it uses a laser to set magnetic bits that are then read back
[0:51:28] <xanderfist> Gamecube was awesome
[0:51:30] <Ran196> Did you open the front door yet?

[0:52:32] <+The_H1R0> TFW when you know the layout of a game world better than the layout of your own workplace form memory.

[0:53:03] <%Svanyr> Svanyr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Aw yeah, 36 months. Time for mojitos and resident evil strem.
[0:53:03] <misterspotswood> @AngriestPat if you came to texas would you like to shoot some chot guns?
[0:53:04] <rytisone> watch Nelo Angelo come out of thee
[0:53:05] <42nfl19> Is there any reason to combine the blue herb with anything?
[0:53:07] <trashcansan> the gamecube was good for one thing: grabbing it by the handle and beating your friend with it when they pull out your controller
[0:53:08] <%bluebiscuit94> There's just a lot of cool cinematography in the RE games overall
[0:53:10] <dreu81> MO discs had some pretty beefy storage capacity for the time -- up to 9 gigs
[0:53:11] <SMuffinMan> Red jewel
[0:53:11] <%ssjklyco> CHOT: Crazy Ho Over There
[0:53:11] <Tersalus> what would that room be used for in real life???
[0:53:12] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor Apparently!
[0:53:13] <jetboots> They really took full advantage of the fixed camera angles in this game
[0:53:14] <%JJCheeker> What's in the box
[0:53:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @arcaderabbit48 Any reference / link to that? Or was it just a guess?
[0:53:23] <+Ilpala> these people love their jewelry boxes
[0:53:23] <%maskofmichael> Where's the chot?
[0:53:25] <bugsmr> how much would installing all the jewel puzzles cost
[0:53:29] <lastleg3ndzer0> Can you play the original games and beat them whitout killing any zombies? The rest of the creatures you can kill them.
[0:53:29] <%natebud> The yawn study
[0:53:31] <%SocialMisfitGamer> @ssjklyco Brilliant
[0:53:39] <%DappercatEsquire> I thought this whole mansion was the "yawn room." Eh? Ehhhhh?
[0:53:40] <%JJCheeker> what's in the boooox
[0:53:41] <+DashXero> No surprises.
[0:53:42] <Starshield1918> The graveyard is a good shortcut
[0:53:44] <%legendscar01> Gamecube system is only good for Resident Evil
[0:53:45] <generalve> pat what do you want to see for a CVX remake ?
[0:53:46] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah fuck that other side of the mansion
[0:54:01] <SMuffinMan> But I like to speedrun
[0:54:03] <+Mitchellsocks> I love that RE engine keeps the beautiful glossiness that this game created
[0:54:12] <%JJCheeker> @legendscar01 and wind waker
[0:54:14] <generalve> the 60fps really makes this look great
[0:54:15] <+king_trito> @legendscar01 Tony hawk pro skater 3
[0:54:17] <%natebud> respawning hunters would be too much
[0:54:19] <%maskofmichael> WEST SIDE
[0:54:21] <%SolverCODO> but true of detroit
[0:54:21] <trashcansan> WEST SIDE
[0:54:22] <%marsproject> Well yea the estate had so many umbrella staff, makes sense there wouldn't be infinite
[0:54:22] <Starshield1918> There ain't shit on the east side at this point anyway
[0:54:23] <%DappercatEsquire> EAST SIDE
[0:54:23] <+Ilpala> cmon don't do metroid prime like that
[0:54:24] <KishinGrek> WEST SIDE
[0:54:24] <lastleg3ndzer0> Can you play the original games and beat them whitout killing any zombies? the rest of the creatures you can kill them.
[0:54:30] <%MelBrooksKA> West side confirmed best side?
[0:54:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor IGN has an article calculating everything out, just Google how much the RE1 mansion would cost
[0:54:35] <%maskofmichael> NORTH SIDE
[0:54:35] <+JasonTheJazz> yeah, I gave up on the original RE1 when you cant avoid the nonstop combat
[0:54:38] <lionandfox21> @FirearmsInstructor I'm from Los Angeles and from the looks of it the Spencer Mansion has a similar build to the infamous Greystone Mansion and since the Spencer estate is bulit in the the 50's/60's I would say 4 million at the time of it being bulit
[0:54:40] <Tersalus> I would love to see a family trying to live their lives in the mansion, no zombies, no Umbrella. Just getting lost on the way to the kitchen
[0:54:41] <majima666> yeah, theres no excuse to why this isnt 60 on the console versions of the remaster
[0:54:42] <%D3rrtyD4n> yay for puzzle
[0:54:44] <trashcansan> WEST SIDE BEST SIDE
[0:54:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> West Coast Best Coast
[0:54:46] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat All the Zombies would be crimson heads if you didn't burn them
[0:54:47] <RadShiro> man look at all those awesome items in the item box that Pat will never use

[0:55:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor Though it is specifically the house, and not the underground lab parts or the furnishings. But fi you want a puzzle mansion, it'd be around 2 mil
[0:55:18] <TalisKanju> Worst puzzle in the game
[0:55:19] <%Jekado> look at those ortario tangrams
[0:55:20] <%moogleboy1984> Dr. Quandary's Secret Island

[0:59:27] <castlerock42> Does anybody in this mansion use books for their intended purpose?
[0:59:30] <%JJCheeker> I knew everything about this game because I bought the guide
[0:59:37] <%NoMoreHero51> @angriestpat theres been a patch drop for temtem
[0:59:40] <%legendscar01> Everybody knows RE2 like the back of their hand Fact
[0:59:41] <%Typhaeon> You don't even have time to explain why you don't have time to explain Kappa
[0:59:42] <%marsproject> I'd watch you play your 'for fun' games Pat.

[0:59:43] <%DappercatEsquire> @castlerock42 What you mean like to hold a gun?
[0:59:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Seriously Umbrella is it so fucking hard to use keycards and a number pad?
[0:59:50] <%kujofire990> @AngriestPat so...does anybody actaully read the books in THIS MANSION?

[1:00:14] <shotgang86> LUL LUL
[1:00:16] <%Svanyr> should have carved the tail bro!
[1:00:16] <Mr_Zero5232> What would've been the combat applications for a big snek
[1:00:18] <+DashXero> Monster Hunter habits don't go away.
[1:00:21] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor Monster Hunter joke
[1:00:21] <%TaphexWin> Not gonna lie, thought there were crowns outside my window
[1:00:22] <%thegreenbenis> THE TAIL
[1:00:23] <%legendscar01> Is Umbrella Real? kappa
[1:00:24] <%Typhaeon> Just did about 5 Sharas in a row, verging on a panic attack
[1:00:25] <%Hiro01231> Don't forget the tail
[1:00:25] <%Svanyr> you missed the mantle bro!
[1:00:26] <%linkster291> It's flipping you out because you want that sick Yawn armor.
[1:00:26] <+twin_triggers> apatWink doodBro
[1:00:27] <FirearmsInstructor> oh god damnit
[1:00:27] <%Typhaeon> From that phrase

[1:00:31] <%ssjklyco> it's carved into your mind
[1:00:31] <%thegreenbenis> The tail Pat
[1:00:32] <%SoFarFetched> @FirearmsInstructor You "carve" in Monster Hunter games to get materials from them.
[1:00:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> forgot to carve yawn LUL
[1:00:33] <$Ziegsy> jill leaves with a pair of new snakeskin boots and a belt
[1:00:37] <ovan20> cut the tail of the hunters and carve it!
[1:00:38] <DandyMackeroos> @monkeyweed21 They do have a keycard and key in RE3
[1:00:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched yeah I get it, and I hate that I get it D:

[1:00:52] <+DashXero> Shara Ishvalda kinda sucks for SnS.
[1:00:53] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean you picking up ammo and items is like stopping to pick up nulberries
[1:00:53] <%Alpha8087> I WANT IT
[1:00:55] <tank7013> I mean Yawn is basically Najarala if you think about it
[1:00:55] <%JJCheeker> Now you will never get the yawn great sword
[1:00:57] <Nina96> Shara is fine
[1:00:59] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat the funny thing is that I just finished my blackveil set and Max vaal hammer
[1:00:59] <%DappercatEsquire> Again, a missed business opportunity from DUMBrella. Big snek = big snek skin = many snek boot.
[1:01:00] <%misha_kastrilevich> Oh man I hope the zombies don't hear me BANG BANG STOMP STOMP BANG STOMP
[1:01:05] <%Soaked_Circuits> How broken would an armor system be in RE though?

[1:01:33] <majima666> re4*

[1:03:02] <%JJCheeker> Glad I don't live in Canada
[1:03:03] <Sagata_> not 2-3 feet, more like 7 feet of snow overnight
[1:03:03] <%LaughingCatt> we need to package the snow & ship it to Australlia
[1:03:04] <%natebud> Yes the provence was named after it @Monkeyweed21
[1:03:06] <bugsmr> so like winter in buffalo
[1:03:06] <%maskofmichael> And all of that is WITH global warming
[1:03:09] <majima666> doesnt really get THAT cold here in the north west of england
[1:03:09] <%darthfodder> 55 in California B)
[1:03:12] <SMuffinMan> That's all?

[1:03:16] <%SilverFaustX> never understood why they dont send the snow to australia
[1:03:18] <majima666> i mean cold, but not russian or canadian winter cold
[1:03:20] <%legendscar01> Two shots from shotgun, not powerful
[1:03:21] <+DashXero> Geez. Hope they got everything they needed from the grocery store for a while. Ain't nothin' movin' in 70cm of snow.
[1:03:23] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat it's also pretty cold here in Brazil, 18¬∞ C

[1:03:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @darthfodder yeah but liberals...
[1:03:26] <Starshield1918> I think it's the only exit
[1:03:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @SilverFaustX just gotta put it in a big truck, seems obvious
[1:03:38] <%SilverFaustX> i know
[1:03:40] <Starshield1918> oh god right,

[1:04:07] <Josef_Stryker> Can the incendiary rounds keep zambos dead as if u were burning their corpses?
[1:04:08] <%darthfodder> @firearmsinstructor liberals are the best part. I live in a conservative town, though.

[1:04:31] <FirearmsInstructor> wait why no TEMTEM tonight or whatever it's called?
[1:04:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> Digimon will sue TemTem
[1:04:32] <%SomeSageAdvice> i thought it was Digimon
[1:04:33] <%LunarRemix> No, it would probably be Megami Tensei
[1:04:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Sorry I got here late.
[1:04:35] <%LunarRemix> or Last bible
[1:04:35] <%Zebroneath> And SMT is down with the devil
[1:04:36] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat What resident evil game would you rank as the legit scariest?
[1:04:37] <+Shoosler> Temtem looks like complete garbage
[1:04:37] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I must have crazy luck but I got a total of 10 lvl4 guard or offensive guard decos
[1:04:38] <%Monkeyweed21> what about Tamagotchi?
[1:04:39] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Not even, the series is actually older back when it was just Megami Tensei
[1:04:39] <%LaughingCatt> SMT with the demons yup
[1:04:40] <heartlesshealer> It was either SMT or Dragon Quest, but yeah pokemon was not the first on console

[1:04:45] <%necrocannibal2> there's also this thing called hunting which people do in real life
[1:04:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Temtem's not using any intellectual properties that don't belong to them
[1:04:50] <FirearmsInstructor> Seeing RE threw me off.
[1:04:52] <majima666> pokemon was in developmet for AAAGES though

[1:05:44] <deltakuma009> playing ds3 should i get gudyrs chain or his spear?
[1:05:45] <%arcaderabbit48> Its like saying shouldn't Square have been sued over Final Fantasy for ripping off Dungeons and Dragons. Oh wait no, they actually did do that. And didn't get sued.
[1:05:46] <%marsproject> YOU NEED IT
[1:05:48] <%legendscar01> Does anybody know Chinpokemon?

[1:06:20] <%darthfodder> The author of Beowulf should sue everyone
[1:06:23] <lionandfox21> @thedank I remember Monster Rancher had an anime with it
[1:06:23] <trashcansan> temtem is on fire
[1:06:25] <+Shoosler> Temtem looks weak
[1:06:25] <heartlesshealer> Everyone forgets Monster Rancher because all your mons are forced to die of age due to domestication
[1:06:26] <%LunarRemix> Forget SMT IV, when's Nocturne
[1:06:26] <%JJCheeker> I'm glad I was hoping you would strim this
[1:06:30] <%shootbang_exe> shootbang_exe subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Been catching up on the "censorship" shit and cracking up. Here's to another month you crazy ginger internet man

[1:06:43] <%filialpails> hwaet!
[1:06:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> only good ten ten is Shin Megami Ten Ten
[1:06:45] <%natebud> His estate should sue then
[1:06:45] <$Ziegsy> Pat temtem displays yer id code on screen at all times so you can be bugged with messages.
[1:06:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, that;s the joke
[1:06:46] <%Sausious> no but sue them tho
[1:06:46] <%Septawn> 1300ish
[1:06:47] <%necrocannibal2> his estate
[1:06:47] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:06:48] <theredfox930000> your dead
[1:06:48] <+DashXero> Also, isn't Beowulf public domain?
[1:06:48] <Jolly_Adventurer> Just dig up the corpse
[1:06:49] <%misha_kastrilevich> OMG someone should make a Beowulf game
[1:06:50] <%MegboyManuel> i just hate how temtem looks
[1:06:53] <Fujiwara_92> so? your point?
[1:06:53] <%misha_kastrilevich> that would be sick
[1:06:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Disney probably owns the corpse
[1:06:58] <%Teintstein> you know he didn't renew his copyright
[1:07:02] <%TwinBat> yeah I don't like the artstyle at all
[1:07:03] <+king_trito> where's my monster musume game vargDong
[1:07:06] <Tersalus> Boooo, book nerds!!
[1:07:07] <%legendscar01> Almost a thousand years
[1:07:07] <tank7013> @necrocannibal2 It's a monster catcher/battler pokemon like mmo basically
[1:07:08] <MSN04_Sazabi> He's coming back, the Machete man went to get him
[1:07:09] <%Shacklebox> did lawsuits even exist when beowulf was getting rocked by a grundle?
[1:07:09] <%darthfodder> That's the joke :)
[1:07:10] <lionandfox21> @DashXero Yeah its been public domain forever
[1:07:18] <$lotharrio> Author of the Epic of Giglamesh should sue.
[1:07:20] <%VashyronM> I'll sue on his behalf and then dig him up and throw then money into his grave.
[1:07:21] <%spongeofmystery> Nobody knows who wrote it though
[1:07:23] <%BayowolfTerra> Its legally distinct. See the a, y, and o.
[1:07:24] <lionandfox21> Beowulf old as fuck
[1:07:25] <%necrocannibal2> @tank7013 oh. is it new?
[1:07:32] <%necrocannibal2> @tank7013 never heard of it
[1:07:33] <%arcaderabbit48> @Shacklebox Yes. Legal issues have existed as long as human society
[1:07:34] <Mr_Zero5232> It's folklore, how would anyone track the original writer down and why bother
[1:07:36] <%ssjklyco> Pokemons are just sta ds
[1:07:39] <MSN04_Sazabi> Lawsuits totally existed in Ancient Greece and Rome
[1:07:41] <%ssjklyco> stands
[1:07:41] <Starshield1918> The author of Beowulf should sue the Mace the Dark Age people
[1:07:45] <$Ziegsy> I want an scp/cryptid monster raising game.
[1:07:47] <%WackyXmand> you guys ever see that CGI animated Beowulf movie?
[1:07:48] <%Madbearv> you lie
[1:07:53] <tank7013> @necrocannibal2 I believe the early access build just released today
[1:07:53] <%Shacklebox> pokemon are furry stands and you get six of them
[1:08:02] <Tersalus> cant believe that Bob Iger won that lawsuit against Ptolemy
[1:08:02] <%bluebiscuit94> The french guy who wrote the Arthurian cycle should sue Fate
[1:08:06] <%legendscar01> Pokemon is awesome
[1:08:07] <FG_Leo106> you forgot the Crank Pat
[1:08:10] <tank7013> @necrocannibal2 Publicly anyway
[1:08:10] <%Grayhammatter> shit's dark
[1:08:15] <+Matto424> Man what a crazy twist
[1:08:16] <%arcaderabbit48> @Shacklebox I mean, that's just Sex Pistols but with extra steps
[1:08:17] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat if you love this game so much why don't you marry it
[1:08:18] <TalisKanju> Gotta get that stone and metal object
[1:08:19] <FG_Leo106> also Good Evening :)
[1:08:21] <heartlesshealer> We have entire ancient clay tablets that are just complaining about some dude running a scam
[1:08:25] <%maskofmichael> Now it's too bright to see
[1:08:27] <trashcansan> the writer of the stories of Gilgamesh should sue
[1:08:31] <%ScreamLord> Beowulf is like one of the oldest stories we could find still intact isn't it? Up there with Gilgamesh
[1:08:31] <%LunarRemix> The pok√©mon formula is really weird considering you had earlier stuff like SMT do pet battles better with more complexity
[1:08:32] <%marsproject> Shoulda had Wesker or Barry poking their head in the window to scare the fuck out of you.
[1:08:33] <majima666> for the backgrounds with moving objects do they use videos instead?
[1:08:36] <%legendscar01> Fuck up Ozwell's office, just ran sack it
[1:08:43] <%SilverFaustX> i just realised suikoden is just like pokemon
[1:08:43] <%Faustgesicht> Clearly the creator of Folklore should sue everyone
[1:08:44] <%maskofmichael> God should sue
[1:08:46] <Gallhint> why the fuck did resident evil never get an anime
[1:08:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> you need crank
[1:08:53] <TalisKanju> Do you have the crank?
[1:08:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why was everyone yelling at you to put back the steel and stone object here last night?
[1:08:57] <%LunarRemix> They really got stuck in the same formula gen in gen out
[1:08:58] <MSN04_Sazabi> Also cheating on exams goes back to at least 1500 BCE
[1:08:58] <%DappercatEsquire> Crank down
[1:08:59] <Starshield1918> the helmet emporium
[1:09:07] <%Jane_Lo> @Gallhint it kind of did, but just a 3d movies lmao
[1:09:10] <%ChaosAethr> Quick question to the chat is there anyway to get Kulve Armor again in MHW on PC?
[1:09:13] <%bluebiscuit94> LUL
[1:09:14] <trashcansan> helmet factory
[1:09:14] <%spongeofmystery> @MSN04_Sazabi lawsuits in Saxon times were basically "pay this dude's weight in silver for killing him"
[1:09:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> @maskofmichael Let him, let's go I know the law
[1:09:15] <MSN04_Sazabi> We have fucking clay table cheet sheets
[1:09:15] <ElbanditThePaladin> office of Mr. Helmet
[1:09:16] <%natebud> Anything's possible
[1:09:17] <%JJCheeker> I don't think I ever used the shotgun in this game for Jill. I always did the grenade launcher ammo glitch
[1:09:17] <%Sausious> he;s makign sure we';re payign attwention
[1:09:17] <%legendscar01> Damn it pat
[1:09:17] <%necrocannibal2> LUL
[1:09:19] <%marsproject> apatBig OOPS
[1:09:24] <%Shadowpint> RE doesn't need an anime, it turned into one starting with CVX
[1:09:24] <shotgang86> Man its kinda sad that we will never see a game like this from Capcom ever again.
[1:09:26] <FG_Leo106> do you guys remember those Crank movies? btw haha
[1:09:28] <rytisone> crank up the jam
[1:09:29] <%Monkeyweed21> when is Alice gonna show up to save the day?
[1:09:30] <$RealThiele> entertainment VALUE
[1:09:32] <%natebud> Thanks for showing us the dangers of forgetting the crank
[1:09:33] <misterspotswood> i misheard crank as CRACK and was very confused
[1:09:33] <TalisKanju> You were just showing how DANGEROUS not having the crank is
[1:09:35] <Tersalus> pobody's nerfect!
[1:09:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @FG_Leo106 LUL yeah
[1:09:37] <%ssjklyco> Pat's Cranky about it now
[1:09:41] <+DashXero> @ChaosAethr Yeah. They'll still run Kulve siege from time to time.
[1:09:43] <Starshield1918> It's this weird trick that gives you basically unlimited ammo
[1:09:45] <@commanderclaw> Infinite grenade ammo in the GC version
[1:09:46] <%kingbaconcrispy> You can have infinite ammo for it
[1:09:47] <%SilverFaustX> they patched it
[1:09:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> @spongeofmystery Which was actually really civilized compared to the endless vendetta cycle that predated that LUL
[1:09:50] <majima666> there was a way to fudge unlimited ammo for it
[1:09:50] <%legendscar01> Something to do with the item box I believe
[1:09:51] <%scaryboisupreme> It's only in the original GC release
[1:09:52] <Starshield1918> it involves specially placing things int he item box and doing a bunch of weird shit
[1:09:54] <%ScreamLord> @ChaosAethr by hunting Kulve or using mods
[1:09:58] <Gallhint> or maybe like an anime adaptation showing alpha team or whichever getting fucked up at the mansion
[1:09:59] <trashcansan> pat confirmed for big cheater
[1:09:59] <%JJCheeker> It required the item box
[1:09:59] <%spongeofmystery> Stack underflow, don't think it worked on the PAL version though
[1:10:02] <%kingbaconcrispy> For the flame rounds. It's a glitch you activate with the item box.
[1:10:05] <$lotharrio> THere was a way to glitch out Jill's grenade rounds to be 255 or so.
[1:10:06] <lionandfox21> @ScreamLord I believe so and I think it also depends on the "version" cause epics and sagas have changes in details depending on who is telling the story, kinda like a bunch of fairy tells having their origin from th Eastern end of the Silk Road
[1:10:09] <Tersalus> the secret for more ammo is to not miss
[1:10:12] <majima666> yeah, it was only for the ntsc version sadly
[1:10:12] <Gallhint> 3d movies were bretty good
[1:10:14] <%Solidnick18> apatGib
[1:10:15] <%WackyXmand> god I'm doing my weekly bounties in MHW right now and I need to kill a Scarred Garuga...pray for me apatDab
[1:10:17] <TalisKanju> If you try to load the grenade launcher from the item box in the Gamecube version, you can get tons of ammo
[1:10:25] <%JJCheeker> I actually found it by accident before looking it up
[1:10:28] <majima666> even when it comes to good glitches us pal players got fucked lol

[1:13:16] <%Conyst> why is RE6 the length of a JRPG anyway?
[1:13:16] <%xxinevitablexii> RE:6 was the first one I tried on the collection pack with UMVC. game blows
[1:13:17] <Gallhint> you gonna skip re5? it's kind of a lame entry...

[1:13:20] <$Vilecrow> you could be play CVX again.
[1:13:20] <%arcaderabbit48> CVX got really fun in just how miserable you were, so that sounds good
[1:13:21] <%natebud> So best to worst?
[1:13:22] <+coyotesenpai> @AngriestPat so in your opinion what is the worst Resi?
[1:13:23] <%ssjklyco> The lowest stream turn out ever becomes RE6
[1:13:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> i actually dont outright hate re6
[1:13:24] <iWBstovetop> Just do Ada‚Äôs
[1:13:26] <KeiPrime> i dont get why its jakes campaign when it should be sherry's campaign
[1:13:26] <%bevyrage> have you thought about doing co-op to make your misery much less predictable?
[1:13:27] <KishinGrek> We' ll suffer together budfy
[1:13:27] <%Dragon_Batman> Not the story chronological one?
[1:13:31] <+superb_superbia> I will also be here for RE5 because my disc was corrupted and it always crashed a few missions in
[1:13:33] <%godzookylives> Will you do RE5 DLC?
[1:13:33] <+Melodic_Mane> thats a good order to play through that shitshow of a game
[1:13:34] <%honeyman18> I ain't promising shit, I got tickets to The Color Out of Space Movie.
[1:13:34] <%Jolnir> Jake wesker
[1:13:34] <+DRAGKUDO> oh wow I always saved Leon for last
[1:13:34] <%marsproject> Jake? You mean Sherry right? Because Sherry is best girl.
[1:13:35] <%DappercatEsquire> Fuck I can't believe that goddamn dinosaur
[1:13:35] <%Solidnick18> i keep forgetting about weskers son
[1:13:37] <%kingbaconcrispy> Chris and early Leon is the worst
[1:13:37] <$RealThiele> A D U H
[1:13:38] <%misha_kastrilevich> "I don't want dogs to bite my asshole" Pat 2020 ***
[1:13:39] <MattDemers> Temtem has a 1000 person queue atm
[1:13:39] <TalisKanju> Can't wait for you to shit on that game
[1:13:39] <%Rock_Fire> Oh boy, suffering through RE 6 with Pat
[1:13:39] <%Taisuru> Now that we got you to back down on RE6, when's DMC2?
[1:13:39] <KSGregg> i've never seen any of 6 so i'll be here
[1:13:40] <%Grayhammatter> oh god, the fucking devilijho eyeball dinosaur, i FORGOT
[1:13:46] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Will you have online on for the Crossover missions?
[1:13:52] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat What about Ada campaign on RE4
[1:13:53] <%kingbaconcrispy> Chris's scenario takes an entire nose dive.
[1:13:55] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat you seen the cat that almost went on a coma after breaking out of a pet hotel and mating with 6 females?
[1:13:56] <tank7013> Maaaaan Jake and Adult Sherry were wasted on that game
[1:13:57] <+PanicSwytch> I genuinely want to watch RE7 stream
[1:13:58] <jorniev> i did it leon jake chris... and i dropped it at chris
[1:14:05] <+whackashack> He should play DMC2 on Leap day!
[1:14:06] <%Agami23> will you do both campaigns in 4?
[1:14:11] <%SoySocks> Pat are you playing this on PC with mods like the previous games, or are you playing a console release of it?
[1:14:11] <%TrollKing96> @AngriestPat You do DDTs and Bulldogs in RE6. How can it be that bad?
[1:14:15] <Starshield1918> Ya know, Chris gets a working flamer thrower here
[1:14:17] <jadefox33445> I sat through CVX. Six will be a cake walk
[1:14:18] <heartlesshealer> We have to ask Woolie too, can't have a DMC without both of them
[1:14:23] <%DappercatEsquire> Leopard evolves into dinosaur, it's just science
[1:14:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Whats your favorite new monster in Iceborne @AngriestPat ?
[1:14:25] <%natebud> Can we talk about Ada's imaginary co-op friend?
[1:14:27] <Starshield1918> So is Jake actually good?
[1:14:27] <+Melodic_Mane> re6 should've just been about them
[1:14:29] <%necrocannibal2> is her name Adult Sherry
[1:14:29] <%marsproject> Shoulda had their own game.
[1:14:31] <TalisKanju> JAKE is a great character?
[1:14:33] <%Dragon_Batman> Yuppers
[1:14:37] <DSD24> @natebud Agent had cool taunts!
[1:14:38] <jeffishype> now we'll never see them again ever.
[1:14:39] <person181> just makes you want RE6 make huh
[1:14:39] <%maskofmichael> What if they were in RE8?
[1:14:40] <%legendscar01> CVX is better then 6
[1:14:44] <%xxinevitablexii> SHIN Sherry
[1:14:44] <%Solidnick18> chris and the slide in re6 good times
[1:14:45] <KishinGrek> Will suzi co op with u on RE6?
[1:14:48] <%WackyXmand> Sherry SHERRY!
[1:14:51] <Starshield1918> that square crank is pretty much useless at this point
[1:14:51] <%natebud> jake is discount nathan drake.
[1:14:51] <jeffishype> they've been banished to the pachinko mines
[1:14:52] <jorniev> i mean he is an interesting character
[1:14:56] <%Conyst> Jake is alot better than Steve
[1:14:56] <KarakuriBro> Oh god im terrified of lisa trevor!!
[1:14:57] <%ssjklyco> i feel like we are never going to get a game that is as good as Revelations 2 was
[1:14:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> @taliskanju He could have been if it weren't for the dumb story
[1:15:00] <+PanicSwytch> Sherry and Jake deserve a stand alone game
[1:15:01] <TalisKanju> Best OC in RE6 is clearly Piers
[1:15:03] <Starshield1918> oh wait no its not
[1:15:03] <+The_H1R0> @AngriestPat How much of a charity incentive would it take to make you play the shit spinoffs like Dead Aim, Gun Survivor and Umbrella Chronicles?
[1:15:04] <Tersalus> did they do Sherry like they did to Newt in Aliens?
[1:15:06] <+superb_superbia> @AngriestPat If they remake 5 do you think they'd keep the boulder punching in?
[1:15:07] <majima666> @legendscar01 i like cv more than 0
[1:15:09] <KeiPrime> BOULDER??
[1:15:10] <+superb_superbia> (speaking of boulders)
[1:15:14] <%spongeofmystery> 6 has that Nemesis stand in that I want to call Ustabiaz even though it's definitely not that
[1:15:14] <%Solidnick18> punch it
[1:15:14] <%chiluzza> punch it
[1:15:14] <%Monkeyweed21> PUNCH
[1:15:15] <tank7013> @Starshield1918 His design isn't the greatest but he's honestly pretty cool otherwise. There's also the story potential you get from having Wesker's kid
[1:15:15] <%DappercatEsquire> Piers was such a good boy
[1:15:15] <Starshield1918> don't mind me Pat I'm sick and robotripping right now
[1:15:15] <%Grayhammatter> super crazy
[1:15:16] <%legendscar01> Fo sure
[1:15:19] <jeffishype> punch it
[1:15:21] <Meekest> I sure hope thats not Chris's blood
[1:15:21] <%ssjklyco> just roll with it
[1:15:22] <rytisone> Chris intensifies
[1:15:23] <%Sausious> where's chris to punch it
[1:15:23] <%LunarRemix> Muffled Christ sounds in the distanced
[1:15:24] <%marsproject> About to run into Enrico?
[1:15:24] <%Solidnick18> thanks chat
[1:15:25] <+PanicSwytch> Chris can punch it
[1:15:26] <%WackyXmand> CHRISSS!
[1:15:27] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat I could have sworn I saw that Jake was getting his own game some where.
[1:15:30] <%legendscar01> Punch the boulder
[1:15:36] <%maskofmichael> Kick the boulder
[1:15:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[1:15:40] <%lockbreaker> real question: am I allowed to be in this chat if I genuinely liked re6

[1:15:54] <Meekest> @AngriestPat In an RE1 remake, would they make Lisa Trevor the Mr. X?
[1:15:57] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Ready for Black Tiger?
[1:15:59] <%kingbaconcrispy> It's much better then in the original.
[1:16:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @lockbreaker I liked it too, especially the really dumb shit.
[1:16:01] <majima666> grip that girthy shaft gurl

[1:19:20] <%natebud> Quick reminder that Trevor is a professional architect. The man designed that boulder hallway
[1:19:21] <rytisone> Who could've punched it?
[1:19:24] <+superb_superbia> Chris was on the other side
[1:19:28] <%JJCheeker> indiana Jones

[1:19:38] <%valriot> Chris pushed it
[1:19:39] <%legendscar01> Black Tiger
[1:19:40] <%marsproject> Jill can't punch it, she doesn't have Chris's boulderpunching expertise
[1:19:40] <+IxDomxI> and that's the reason why chris got big enough to punch boulders in 5
[1:19:41] <ShichiNoBushi> It was the T-Virus.
[1:19:42] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Why'd you run? The rock clearly wanted a hug..
[1:19:42] <%SoFarFetched> Chris should have punched it

[1:26:43] <%legendscar01> Ammo Anxiety?
[1:26:48] <iWBstovetop> Where do anticipate RE8 being set?
[1:26:53] <+Melodic_Mane> okay, when you said you where drowning in health items, i wasn't expecting half the damn hcest to be healing cocaine
[1:27:02] <majima666> port over the cvx knife
[1:27:04] <%valriot> @iwbstovetop Detroit
[1:27:09] <%spongeofmystery> Terrified he wouldn't have enough ammo to finish the game even though he had more ammo than he could carry
[1:27:11] <%natebud> south america, it's where Eveline's boat was going @iWBstovetop
[1:27:16] <+The_H1R0> You might not even need it Pat... But what if you do?

[1:27:19] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd
[1:27:21] <MrGarettLefebvre> He has so many health items that he can get one hit killed by every remaining Hunter in the game and still win

[1:27:24] <+superb_superbia> Wait they don't snort the herbs do they
[1:27:26] <%Valdorick> Spend NOTHING
[1:27:29] <%maskofmichael> Healing Cocaine?
[1:27:36] <%Valdorick> If you're using items, you're wrong.
[1:27:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat wanted to show us how difficult directions are
[1:27:38] <theaterunderground> healing cocaine lol
[1:27:40] <%crimsonharvest> huh i didnt know coke came in Healing Version now
[1:27:45] <%legendscar01> Or ammo
[1:27:47] <%natebud> wow
[1:27:49] <Starshield1918> I don't think I've ever been genuinely low on ammo in an RE game that wasn't on hard mode
[1:27:50] <%necrocannibal2> cheers Geoff
[1:27:51] <+Melodic_Mane> how the fuck else do you use herb powder? what, you rub it on your bites? hell no, you snort that shit lol
[1:27:53] <TheIronBrass> Pro tip
[1:27:53] <%Taisuru> To not use
[1:27:55] <trulythedude> no shit
[1:27:56] <+Cityscape17> quick question for re fans and pat, is revelations 2 worth playing?
[1:27:59] <8hoursofdrugs> but what if you need them laterer though
[1:28:00] <%ssjklyco> You might need them for the final boss
[1:28:03] <$lotharrio> That's the trick. Zombies can't catch you if you're on fire.
[1:28:04] <%ha2ken> It's RPG logic...save your ethers for the final final final boss
[1:28:06] <%spongeofmystery> BARRY
[1:28:07] <majima666> well, they did use to use cocaine as a medicine lol
[1:28:08] <%Alazull> Herb powder could be tea
[1:28:09] <%TinyLittleDancer> So those items are for people who don't know where to go and mess up which rooms are "safe"?
[1:28:10] <%honeyman18> there has to be a shirt that say Legalize Herb with a green herb from RE on it right?
[1:28:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean is it powder or a paste? because it looks like sticky icky ickiest dank I'd smoke
[1:28:13] <%valriot> Don't you get a better ranking not using them as well?
[1:28:19] <bugsmr> you use the herb powder like fun dip
[1:28:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How far are you through the game, in your estimation?
[1:28:27] <%legendscar01> Time to face the Thing from RE4
[1:28:27] <%kujofire990> BARRY
[1:28:28] <%the_vedo_show> herb powder atpMunchies
[1:28:28] <+The_H1R0> @Cityscape17 It is actually pretty good, not amazing but better than say re5/6
[1:28:28] <%NitronStreams> If your not hoarding items like a dragon what are you even doing
[1:28:34] <RadShiro> if you never gonna use healing items, why just never pick them up? doodBigBrain
[1:28:35] <%marsproject> Was it a gunshot?
[1:28:35] <bomfiz> Jill sandwich
[1:28:37] <%Alazull> Rub the herb powder into your gums

[1:29:55] <%natebud> @Taisuru Both of those statements are accurate
[1:29:59] <%BlueMoonBlues> "Go, petite woman. I shall stay like the big man I am."
[1:30:00] <%kujofire990> @Taisuru this lisa, that could be true tho
[1:30:02] <%TheMattman1313> "Sorry Jill I would go, but you're the protagonist."
[1:30:06] <Starshield1918> Gotta get the box

[1:30:11] <FG_Leo106> i dont trust Barry for some reason :/
[1:30:12] <JackKrauser> Tells jill to go check it out while he handles his .44 magnum and wait.. hm.
[1:30:12] <Starshield1918> there's a door to go through
[1:30:13] <dukenux> Believe in Barry, that believes in you!
[1:30:13] <+Melodic_Mane> in these situations, we'd all be barry, putting someone else into the fire before ourselves
[1:30:15] <%SoFarFetched> think its later for the box
[1:30:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No Pat, this is Resident Evil, not Last of Us.
[1:30:18] <Starshield1918> and you send a box across on the gondola
[1:30:20] <+Navekraith> Barry's like I got wife and kids. Yo and Chris are never gonna be a thing only partners-partners-partners.

[1:43:12] <%valriot> That was some George Romero shit
[1:43:14] <%Rotanimood> Bring Suzi to the podcast
[1:43:17] <%Maids4lyfe> it's been years already pat, when are you giving your poor mother some grandkids
[1:43:18] <+BionoidLCR> @barkon345 thespherehunter
[1:43:19] <%spongeofmystery> Made by Moonglint studios
[1:43:20] <%kujofire990> That Puke zombie just made me laugh so hard I couldn't breathe
[1:43:23] <%Aydarkzero> she's a huge fan
[1:43:23] <Jaller101514> the shpere hunter YouTube buddy of pat
[1:43:26] <Starshield1918> I used to do those
[1:43:30] <@commanderclaw> She's like a superhero, but for Survival Horror
[1:43:32] <%Caped_Eggy> Everyone's a bigger fan than you pat
[1:43:32] <Fujiwara_92> she is
[1:43:32] <%legendscar01> Pat is not a true RE fan confirmed
[1:43:34] <%mistersups> Is Resident Evil 'Spheres?'
[1:43:34] <%natebud> She could beat Pat in an RE fight
[1:43:36] <%PauliusMaximus> if you say resident evil she appears
[1:43:36] <%kingbaconcrispy> I did a knif eonly run
[1:43:36] <majima666> yeah, she does have a voice for voice acting
[1:43:37] <%Alpha8087> Why knife when you can dual blades
[1:43:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeyeye
[1:43:39] <%ssjklyco> but you never fell asleep during a playthrough
[1:43:40] <%kingbaconcrispy> It sucks!
[1:43:43] <+Melodic_Mane> knife only? more like, i got other games to play so good luck with that only hehe
[1:43:44] <misterspotswood> suzie crabgrass?
[1:43:49] <%NitronStreams> is Pat a fake RE fan
[1:43:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Secret Umbrella facility"
[1:43:53] <topendmad> pat is a fake fan
[1:43:58] <solidoutlaw> Pat have you heard about the RE2 manhuas where Leon fights god?
[1:43:58] <disister1201> I love suzi but I'm always cautious about guest voice-over
[1:44:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat should voice a Barry homage
[1:44:01] <+Carquar> You wouldn't even need to get down on one knee to propose
[1:44:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are these "spheres" that she hunts, and why?
[1:44:10] <teflonbilly777> Is this where we boo Pat for his opinions?
[1:44:11] <+superb_superbia> Is that Elmo's front end or his caboose
[1:44:16] <%natebud> Like the albanoid
[1:44:16] <oniwahoo> Pat won't even play Gaiden, of course he's a fake fan
[1:44:20] <majima666> i think the name is a reference to ffx2?
[1:44:22] <%Aydarkzero> x2
[1:44:24] <%ssjklyco> So you're the boss?
[1:44:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hot Take, that Vigil game has potential but looks REALLY jank rn. The animations and 3d assets are... ehhhhh
[1:44:25] <%CalderGaming> ffx-2, yeah
[1:44:26] <majima666> yeah ffx2
[1:44:27] <%NopeBadguy> X-2, yes
[1:44:29] <%keyoray> disgaea mid-boss?
[1:44:30] <Starshield1918> That's a huge part of FFX-2
[1:44:31] <%InugamiTheHound> 10-2
[1:44:31] <+Cityscape17> spheres are a X-2 reference
[1:44:32] <Ipsenscastle> X-2, the bad one
[1:44:32] <FirearmsInstructor> oh ok that's why I have no idea what it means
[1:44:33] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the gullwings
[1:44:33] <%Dragon_Batman> Dresspsheres?
[1:44:34] <%natebud> yeah that makes sense
[1:44:35] <rytisone> OrbHunter
[1:44:37] <+superb_superbia> ok that looks like a tail
[1:44:37] <%SoFarFetched> never stop
[1:44:38] <+Mitchellsocks> It's a Haunting Grounds boss fight
[1:44:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Thank you all :)
[1:44:38] <%0oki> Ohhhh so that‚Äôs what it is!
[1:44:41] <RunningNGunning> Yawn is a very appropriate name for the "boss fight" thats about to happen
[1:44:41] <majima666> dumb ass game....but ffx2 is still fun lol
[1:44:41] <teflonbilly777> I desperately want to buy Pat a Mega Milk shirt to piss off anime titty people
[1:44:42] <%necrocannibal2> FFX-2 is the one where they dress like whores?
[1:44:43] <j0ustar> ugh x2
[1:44:43] <%Dragon_Batman> Neat
[1:44:43] <+twin_triggers> lol
[1:44:44] <+Melodic_Mane> soft toe beans
[1:44:44] <%silverira> X-2 sucks holy shit
[1:44:45] <%Shacklebox> beep beep
[1:44:45] <%Alpha8087> Toe bean harvest is good today.
[1:44:47] <%mrcelab> cat foot fetish
[1:44:47] <%spongeofmystery> Shame Pat never got to say "guy's a maniac why'd he bite me?" in the RE2 remake
[1:44:47] <dukenux> Pet his bag nstead
[1:44:47] <%TwinBat> understandable
[1:44:49] <+superb_superbia> Yes that is almost certainly Elmo's butt and not his face, right?
[1:44:52] <%Taisuru> He walks in his litter box with those feet
[1:44:53] <%kujofire990> beep beep
[1:44:56] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat just thinkin bout those beans, huh?
[1:44:57] <+Zereaux> is haunting grounds good?
[1:44:58] <%ogtrashwizard> Pat has a foot fetish?
[1:45:00] <disister1201> Feet stream it is
[1:45:02] <%TomDanksEGOT> at least you can admit you have a problem
[1:45:03] <%NitronStreams> Filthu feet degenerate
[1:45:08] <MachineHead9> @AngriestPat Pet him for me too
[1:45:09] <%trekkie11041> PAT LIKES FEET CONFIRMED
[1:45:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> KILL HIM PAT
[1:45:15] <dukenux> it's purely platonic feet affection
[1:45:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I want Elmo to step on me
[1:45:16] <majima666> x2 would have been much better recieved if it wasnt a sequel and just a spin off title instead
[1:45:16] <+superb_superbia> kitty beans are the softest thing
[1:45:16] <$crusader_heide> In Black Mirror episode about VR, theres a shelf of video games w/ a FAce/Off dvd on it
[1:45:20] <+antdang> plz stop sexual harassing your cat with your disgusting foot fetish
[1:45:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> KILL THE TRAITOR
[1:45:30] <+Melodic_Mane> cat foot fetishist stream extraordinar
[1:45:32] <+Mitchellsocks> Literally the final boss of Block Puzzles
[1:45:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[1:45:48] <teflonbilly777> I can't believe Justin Whang still hasn't found the live action actress from RE 1 on teh PS1
[1:45:50] <SMuffinMan> Survival Mode
[1:45:51] <%Sausious> there's like. an hour left maybe
[1:45:52] <%valriot> @angriestpat I did a no save speedrun and got rng booped off the edge here
[1:45:52] <TalisKanju> Starting 0 tonight?
[1:45:53] <%kujofire990> so re4 next right?
[1:45:53] <%arcaderabbit48> How close are we to the end?
[1:45:56] <+harmoknight> temtems servers arent down pat if youre interested in playing it
[1:46:02] <+Necrodancer> You can admit someone has nice feet without having a fetish. I think cars are dumb but I can admit when someone has a nice car.
[1:46:04] <%natebud> Pat promise you will use all the magnum bullets.
[1:46:05] <oniwahoo> your face is a temtem
[1:46:06] <%legendscar01> RE4?
[1:46:06] <+superb_superbia> @AngriestPat Does Elmo wear a collar? I just bought some for my kitties
[1:46:14] <heartlesshealer> yay scheduling
[1:46:25] <heartlesshealer> Fair worry
[1:46:26] <+superb_superbia> That's why cat collars have breakaway clasps :)
[1:46:26] <MachineHead9> LUL
[1:46:29] <%Maids4lyfe> is he chipped?
[1:46:31] <%valriot> Collars are bad anyway
[1:46:31] <%MoralCompassGaming> yeah i could see that happening
[1:46:32] <%keyoray> even break-away collars?
[1:46:33] <+Melodic_Mane> he's a lovely clutz though so all is forgiven
[1:46:33] <%kingbaconcrispy> @Necrodancer That's something a foot fetishist would say.
[1:46:34] <%mrcelab> @AngriestPat Pat, whats the highest viewer count you had and on what game?
[1:46:34] <%spongeofmystery> BARRY
[1:46:35] <person181> which is fair
[1:46:36] <%miguelrod777> that sounds like what a foot fetishist would say
[1:46:36] <%InugamiTheHound> breakaway collars
[1:46:36] <%damienlunas> They make collars that have release mechanisms in case of that
[1:46:37] <%moogleboy1984> collars are awful for pets, they mat the fur and cause all sorts of skin irritations
[1:46:41] <%maskofmichael> How do you trip on a collar?
[1:46:41] <Hellarussian> the true hero
[1:46:41] <%Teintstein> kill the traitor!
[1:46:42] <%Solidnick18> JILL
[1:46:44] <%king_wragles> No point in collaring an indoor pet
[1:46:44] <rytisone> Barry is a tomb raider
[1:46:45] <dukenux> Whatcha hidin there, Barry
[1:46:46] <%legendscar01> Slap him
[1:46:47] <teflonbilly777> Don't sounds so disappointed Barry!

[1:46:47] <dukenux> D:

[1:47:20] <%ssjklyco> this is a Dark Souls boss
[1:47:21] <+superb_superbia> I have a cat that's a runner so he is definitely going to keep a collar on

[1:50:18] <Tersalus> not a single question??
[1:50:21] <Hellarussian> theres no good reason to trust him at this point
[1:50:21] <teflonbilly777> SUCK A BARREL OF MOIST DICKS BARRY
[1:50:22] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Lisa is protecting Michael Jacksons bones.
[1:50:22] <dukenux> Thanks for being shady af Barry
[1:50:23] <%Shadowpint> "START TALKING" "okay I trust you again for no reason"
[1:50:26] <oniwahoo> Jill deserves to get infected
[1:50:27] <%kingbaconcrispy> She's already explained here.
[1:50:31] <%InugamiTheHound> they made barry such a lovable goofball in newer games but in this game he's a huge scumbag
[1:50:36] <$crusader_heide> Where did Paige find da Elmo?
[1:50:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> "You breed?"
[1:50:38] <%arcaderabbit48> This whole things felt kinda limp. I understand what happened, it all just felt kinda anticlimactic
[1:50:39] <%NovaKnightmare> Its weird Jill doesnt ask about all that shit
[1:50:39] <%legendscar01> The Hive bois
[1:50:42] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[1:50:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 50m.
[1:50:43] <+Melodic_Mane> moments of extreme stress can make you not think clearly, which is why jill didn't arrest barry in that exact moment
[1:50:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @teflonbilly777 :\
[1:50:44] <%Valdorick> The Ur-Zombino
[1:50:47] <%kingbaconcrispy> You fight her in umbrella chronicle as Wesker thought.
[1:50:48] <%Ranryu692> so she's Virus Mom
[1:50:49] <$lotharrio> I thought they pulled the Nemesis parasite out of her.
[1:50:52] <%spongeofmystery> Snake, it's time to change discs
[1:50:53] <+M3NTH0L> LISA!!! I love you, why you say those things!

[1:51:02] <bleugh> that virus is a real G
[1:51:03] <rytisone> GT Virus
[1:51:05] <%bigdumbidiotguy> she apparently holds the precursor to the Golgotha virus or whatever its called
[1:51:07] <CursedNobleman> what comes after REmake? RE0 then RE4?
[1:51:08] <Starshield1918> Lisa is Nemesis' mom
[1:51:09] <%natebud> Please talk to me Lisa!
[1:51:11] <%bigdumbidiotguy> or Protovirus
[1:51:11] <%senordingdong2> Do you think Wesker is a cuddler?
[1:51:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> They ijected her with T Virus and she absorbed it and then they pulled G out of her
[1:51:16] <MattDemers> More like the initial D virus
[1:51:19] <oniwahoo> @cursednobleman yup
[1:51:20] <MachineHead9> Lisa is the daughter of the architect that built the mansion and umbrella kidnapped her and did experiments on her
[1:51:21] <+Melodic_Mane> change discs anyway
[1:51:21] <Starshield1918> change discs
[1:51:21] <%Agami23> so she is all full of progenitor?
[1:51:21] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah the Golgotha (G-Virus) Is the same virus Nemesis Had.

[1:52:14] <SMuffinMan> Mold, ssjklyko
[1:52:16] <teflonbilly777> G-Virus, T-Virus, Nemesis parasite, Las Plagas, Urobourous. Anything I missed?
[1:52:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> there's an ASMR video on you becoming Nemesis
[1:52:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @sofarfetched only reason inremember is because I used to mix it up yoo

[1:57:23] <SleepyMaribo> why are naked zombies stronger?
[1:57:23] <+Cityscape17> I absolutely loved RE Dead Aim. I had the light gun and everything
[1:57:27] <%Teintstein> they'll be nude, their natural state

[1:58:39] <%kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat There's also first aid
[1:58:40] <%Grayhammatter> ADA
[1:58:42] <%Robnoceros> ADA is a garbage password
[1:58:43] <rytisone> rip tofu
[1:58:46] <%senordingdong2> Why is it just accepted as a common thing for people to be mauled to death at work in the RE universe?
[1:58:49] <%Gogetta159> The Mole easter egg only works on easy
[1:58:54] <%kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat First aid and magnum bullets
[1:58:56] <%senordingdong2> It is considered WAY too normal

[1:59:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Has to be the LOGIN password. JOHN / MOLE
[1:59:37] <Grennold> Insert it 100 times and you'll unlock secret nude Jill CGI renders Kappa
[1:59:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Not the submenu
[1:59:40] <%necrocannibal2> chat is never wrong
[1:59:41] <j0ustar> @arcaderabbit48 I'll give them that any other company's employees would go "nope not paid enough for this shit"
[1:59:42] <%kingbaconcrispy> There was an easter egg, you had to enter it in the second spot.
[1:59:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> "VERONICA"
[1:59:48] <%kingbaconcrispy> Good
[1:59:52] <Starshield1918> There's shotgun ammo behind the bodies, I think?
[1:59:53] <%senordingdong2> Are zombie vaginas still warm
[1:59:57] <%senordingdong2> Asking for a friend
[2:00:02] <Ner234> Always sometimes never trust chat
[2:00:04] <%Teintstein> oof
[2:00:06] <FG_Leo106> CV's Real-Time 3D backgrounds were "cutting edge" back then but they aged like shit unlike REmake which still holds up thanks to the nice looking character models, animatios and Pre-rendered backgrounds :)
[2:00:06] <Hellarussian> poke em
[2:00:06] <bear_breaker20> stop having that friend
[2:00:09] <%necrocannibal2> @senordingdong2 uh
[2:00:11] <Starshield1918> on the shelf I think,
[2:00:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You have to beat the game once for MOLE to work
[2:00:14] <teflonbilly777> @senordingdong2 Yeah, but decomposing
[2:00:14] <$crusader_heide> Is the RE3 online just DBDaylight?
[2:00:14] <CrazyMedicine> This is truly Resident Evil Remake
[2:00:21] <Starshield1918> oooh, it's a first aid box
[2:00:22] <%senordingdong2> Wet is wet
[2:00:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> oh ffs u dummy
[2:00:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @j0ustar Yeah, but that assumes leaving is an option. Once you're down far enough to know about zimbos and Crimson Heads, you're far down enough to murder if you try to leave.
[2:00:24] <%NDHCemployee> @senordingdong2 Get your ass to church
[2:00:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Try logging back in again
[2:00:29] <%necrocannibal2> I'm still thinking about that fish vagina from The Lighthouse

[2:05:45] <Neo_Kaiser> So we learned how Kenneth died, but how did Joseph die?
[2:05:46] <Guardiansaiyan> @misterspotswood its true!
[2:05:54] <Tersalus> is the bite force of a human even powerful enough rip someone apart like zombies do?
[2:06:01] <teflonbilly777> Half of STARS were jobbers
[2:06:04] <Starshield1918> Joseph got doggo'd
[2:06:05] <%incredibleCrayon> incredibleCrayon subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Thanks for the content!

[2:06:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @tersalus yes actually
[2:06:09] <+Melodic_Mane> what does the MO in MO disc stand for?
[2:06:10] <%legendscar01> Joseph died by dogs

[2:06:45] <%spongeofmystery> XMEN WELCOME TO DATA
[2:06:46] <Neo_Kaiser> Nah, we heard he was attacked by zombie dogs, but we never saw it. We need to pick up his GoPro to discover the real mystery.

[2:07:00] <%Alpha8087> The secret to the juggle
[2:07:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its easy as fuck to bite into a human. We got more than enough strength in our jaws to tear away any skin or muscle from a body
[2:07:03] <Grennold> Use all three of those discs and Jill will be D R I P P I N G
[2:07:03] <+TheMissingLink02> STARS? more like TARS.

[2:12:43] <+Melodic_Mane> they look dumb and sound stupid, 10/10 bioweapons
[2:12:46] <$crusader_heide> Theyre DS2 tseldora spidermen
[2:12:54] <%TomDanksEGOT> Chimera Ants?
[2:12:55] <%BayowolfTerra> I think thats right
[2:12:56] <%Zebroneath> You go through this game fast.
[2:13:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Are they a homage to the Fly?
[2:13:01] <Huntercd> Even the G-virus is just an incest thing
[2:13:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> remember that part in RE2 when you got ate by a daggum zombo
[2:13:05] <teflonbilly777> @lotharrio Isn't that just the plan of a few of the founder and some of his inbred kids?
[2:13:06] <Guardiansaiyan> @lotharrio they have to get entertainment somewhere
[2:13:19] <%natebud> Time to waste some magnum bullets to spite th goblins
[2:13:26] <%necrocannibal2> god I love the headshots in this series
[2:13:37] <$psydaku> what i miss?
[2:13:40] <%arcaderabbit48> You ever stop and realize just how much fucking incest there is in Umbrella?
[2:13:44] <%senordingdong2> Wesker definitely bleaches his asshole.
[2:13:45] <Ner234> Oh fuck that. I just looked up how Chimeras are made. WHY?
[2:13:51] <Guardiansaiyan> @psydaku nepotism
[2:13:53] <MattDemers> So how long has this been supposedly abandoned for, again?
[2:13:55] <%necrocannibal2> @Ner234 how
[2:13:58] <BaskerTheHound> @arcaderabbit48 fuck
[2:14:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ner234 budget cuts

[2:14:28] <sidious_77> what was the passworwhat was the second password at the pc?
[2:14:30] <%spongeofmystery> @necrocannibal2 they kidnap homeless women and implant the embryos in them then make them give birth
[2:14:33] <Pnutz409> yesss
[2:14:33] <lionandfox21> @MattDemers For like two decades and it was recently re used
[2:14:35] <%bigdumbidiotguy> don't shoot feces

[2:14:43] <%necrocannibal2> @spongeofmystery wtf
[2:14:46] <Texascourierlive> skipped the ad some how
[2:14:47] <Ner234> @necrocannibal2 homeless women abducted and impregnated with t virus fly embryos bullshit.

[2:15:15] <Texascourierlive> crazy talk activate
[2:15:19] <graemecrackers1> You can do it Pat! Split them wide open!
[2:15:21] <Guardiansaiyan> You know what Umbrella should have invested in? ROOMBAS
[2:15:21] <%Grayhammatter> 360 noscope
[2:15:23] <%spongeofmystery> RE1's version of the Water Room from RE4
[2:15:23] <$crusader_heide> Ashley: How bout we bone? Leon:No.
[2:15:25] <+Melodic_Mane> just 1 acid round is enough to kill them?
[2:15:25] <MachineHead9> you can
[2:15:26] <%SolidusRex> I always found it weird how regular grenade rounds are super effective against them, regular grenade rounds are rarely preferable to the other two
[2:15:31] <%kingbaconcrispy> You can!
[2:15:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> GET FUCKING REKT YOU STUPID FLYING BITCH
[2:15:40] <%Grayhammatter> another gamecube
[2:15:41] <%natebud> They spawn for a while
[2:15:44] <%SolidusRex> You can clean it
[2:15:44] <%InugamiTheHound> those look like bug monsters from re5 from the ship
[2:15:45] <Texascourierlive> lol the game cube
[2:15:48] <+Melodic_Mane> wait, they don't fly though
[2:15:48] <%trekkie11041> @arcaderabbit48 pretty much. theres a picture of a chimera baby on the resident evil wiki if your curious
[2:15:50] <%kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat You can clean it just be aware that some like to change rooms
[2:15:52] <person181> smooth
[2:15:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> you cleared the path enough so you wont blow up
[2:15:57] <djazo> man the ps4 ver of RE4 sucked ass doodSad
[2:15:58] <ShibuyaTomato> it's 100% cleanable
[2:15:59] <Huntercd> These things are just big roaches
[2:15:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Nothing quite says "GET FUCKED" like a 40mm grenade <3
[2:16:00] <%bigdumbidiotguy> u gonna die son
[2:16:07] <%ssjklyco> it's got the litteral controller ports
[2:16:12] <Kristoffers> LUL
[2:16:16] <%bigdumbidiotguy> theres only like 6 chimera in all of Arklay Forest
[2:16:16] <Swimmingrock> Those look like the bug monsters from RE5, but not fully mutated.
[2:16:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[2:16:17] <Tersalus> are those spider-men or man-spiders?
[2:16:17] <%spongeofmystery> This is so dumb
[2:16:17] <%necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:16:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wow Umbrella sucks hard, kidnapping homeless women and forcing them to birth chimeras
[2:16:21] <%legendscar01> Bring it on
[2:16:22] <%kingbaconcrispy> Lol
[2:16:26] <%natebud> Youre just making a mess
[2:16:30] <%Grayhammatter> those are fly-men
[2:16:30] <%TomDanksEGOT> its like a god damn clown car
[2:16:30] <%Maids4lyfe> they're fly-monkeys
[2:16:31] <%ha2ken> They sound similar to Novistadors...but they're bug creatures so...
[2:16:32] <Starshield1918> They're human/fly hybrids
[2:16:32] <+Melodic_Mane> oh yes, keep using acid rounds at point blank range, nothing bad will come orf this carciLUL
[2:16:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> they're chicken squirrel momkys
[2:16:48] <SparkAfterDark> The standard engagement range for a grenade launcher is 10-20 centimeters right?
[2:16:59] <Huntercd> They look like roaches
[2:16:59] <majima666> give it fuel, give it fire
[2:17:05] <Quikanims> what are these enemy types called chat?
[2:17:06] <%Grayhammatter> get fizzed you fuckos
[2:17:09] <Tersalus> wow...I cant believe they got Jeff goldblum to play these enemies
[2:17:11] <$crusader_heide> its fiiiiiiiine
[2:17:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Chimeras
[2:17:15] <%legendscar01> Their human and insect
[2:17:16] <%Maids4lyfe> chimeras @Quikanims
[2:17:17] <superd4v3> @Quikanims Chimeras
[2:17:19] <%natebud> albanoids
[2:17:23] <Quikanims> thank you so much chat
[2:17:26] <Arek_1> @SparkAfterDark Hey, woah... too far. LUL
[2:17:26] <%Maids4lyfe> apatDab
[2:17:26] <%DappercatEsquire> super fly
[2:17:27] <%bigdumbidiotguy> stupid ugly fart fly
[2:17:28] <teflonbilly777> A little splashback never hurt anybody
[2:17:32] <%senordingdong2> Flompies
[2:17:33] <rytisone> now HAUL ASS
[2:17:33] <%ScreamLord> homage?
[2:17:34] <$lotharrio> Brendel-Fly?
[2:17:34] <$crusader_heide> Animorphs
[2:17:35] <%spongeofmystery> Grenades from a launcher don't arm until they're a few metres away specifically to stop the user blowing themselves up
[2:17:37] <%BayowolfTerra> Yeah, normal grenade launchers wont detonate at less
[2:17:40] <%arcaderabbit48> When do we get the Snake People, or Sneople, enemies?
[2:17:41] <Texascourierlive> Do it
[2:17:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> E X P L O D E
[2:17:48] <%TomDanksEGOT> BrundelFly
[2:17:51] <+Melodic_Mane> gimme fuel, no fire please, it's not what we desire
[2:17:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Unfun Fact!: Umbrella used Homeless women injected with insect embryos to make these things
[2:17:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> KA BOOM
[2:17:54] <%arcaderabbit48> boom bewm
[2:17:58] <%MonsieurHedge> fun fact: an allusion that is subconscious or unintentional is called an echo!
[2:18:00] <Texascourierlive> Crazy talk
[2:18:10] <Quikanims> man, what a great enemy design
[2:18:12] <teflonbilly777> The effects in The Fly still hold up. Brundlefly is so grotesque
[2:18:21] <%bigdumbidiotguy> zombie feet are Pat's fetish
[2:18:23] <%Grayhammatter> it is time to explode
[2:18:28] <%legendscar01> That was a crimson head already
[2:18:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> all clear
[2:18:41] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Wouldn't it suck for those naked zombies to come back as Crimson Heads?
[2:18:41] <%senordingdong2> Why waste a highlight on some tumlbr quote bro
[2:18:42] <%Maids4lyfe> I know right? Jeff Goldblum looks like a real person almost.
[2:18:43] <+Melodic_Mane> i wonder why they didn't bring back crimson heads
[2:18:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah they do in this area
[2:18:47] <MachineHead9> yeah at the end they turn real fast
[2:18:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat 40mm HE grenades arm after a distance of approximately 30 meters
[2:18:51] <PkSilent01> so is it explain why these buildings have puzzles installed in them (RPD, Spencer's Mansion, Baker's House, etc.) or is it all just gameplay stuff that will never be explained
[2:18:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> except the naked ones
[2:18:55] <%ssjklyco> Getting attacked by Red Heads now
[2:18:58] <teflonbilly777> Pat can give me some crimson head *nudge nudge wink wink*
[2:19:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah yeah
[2:19:08] <%Maids4lyfe> @Melodic_Mane because all the crimson heads evolved into lickers
[2:19:08] <+Ilpala> I'll highlight whatever the fuck I want, none of you can stop me
[2:19:09] <%bigdumbidiotguy> don't the crimson dumdums evolve into Lickers
[2:19:12] <%Grayhammatter> here we go
[2:19:15] <%senordingdong2> Gettin g attacked by red geads is my dream
[2:19:19] <ScantronTheImmortal> 40mm grenades usually take 10 to 13 rotations in flight to arm
[2:19:19] <%senordingdong2> heads*
[2:19:19] <%BayowolfTerra> Crimson heads are cool on multiple levels
[2:19:21] <Swimmingrock> @PKHTjim Don't know about official, but I always assumed it was for an outbreak. Zombies can't solve puzzles.
[2:19:24] <%legendscar01> Run
[2:19:24] <superd4v3> Here we go chat
[2:19:25] <+Melodic_Mane> @Maids4lyfe aight, i see you
[2:19:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @PkSilent01 Guy who made Umbrella was obsessive over spy movies and wanted his giant mansion to have all kinds of dumb puzzles and traps and stuff.
[2:19:27] <%senordingdong2> I bet you wont highlist your asshole
[2:19:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> poopy butts
[2:19:28] <%D3rrtyD4n> walk hard
[2:19:29] <senfood> @PkSilent01 The person who created the house just really liked puzzles.
[2:19:33] <Northward12> do ittt
[2:19:35] <Oleai> You can run two steps safely. Just don't do the third :)
[2:19:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @teflonbilly777 Is everything you say :\ worthy? D:
[2:19:43] <Tersalus> @teflonbilly777 I still can't get the stomach to watch The Fly...which doesn't have sense considering my favorite movie is the Thing
[2:19:45] <%legendscar01> DEW IT
[2:19:46] <%heroicspiritavenger> Shut the fuck up @Ilpala
[2:19:49] <TalisKanju> Wait, no. This is the worst puzzle in the game.
[2:19:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> u gon explode n die L O L
[2:19:56] <%necrocannibal2> @Tersalus you should, it's an amazing movie
[2:19:57] <+Melodic_Mane> don't test it lol
[2:19:58] <person181> heard it here first "kill everything"-pat
[2:20:01] <Oleai> Pat doesn't do that, lol
[2:20:06] <%natebud> You can run for a bit.
[2:20:09] <%Melodic_Mane> Melodic_Mane subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:20:16] <StygianBarba> apatCrazyhead
[2:20:18] <MrBowza> Pat is a big strong manly man who doesn't shriek like a pansy at the sight of zombies.
[2:20:18] <%legendscar01> Run one step
[2:20:18] <+Ilpala> No
[2:20:18] <+monkeyU33> apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo
[2:20:18] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Pat eats weasel meat
[2:20:19] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What happens if you run?
[2:20:20] <MachineHead9> run 3 steps walk 3 steps
[2:20:20] <%ssjklyco> that's a step in the wrong direction
[2:20:22] <SMuffinMan> I do in ny speedruns
[2:20:26] <PkSilent01> @senfood so why the baker's house have these puzzles in RE7?
[2:20:26] <teflonbilly777> @Tersalus Cronenberg gonna Cronenberg y'all
[2:20:27] <%Erimos> Fun fact: The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
[2:20:33] <%Maids4lyfe> no running in the halls
[2:20:34] <%DappercatEsquire> Do it coward
[2:20:37] <SMuffinMan> My*
[2:20:40] <ShibuyaTomato> you can really make out those jiggle physics in this section
[2:20:42] <Tersalus> @necrocannibal2 I've heard great things! I just have a very specific fear of bot flies, so I'll work up to it
[2:20:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Oh you have the liquid
[2:20:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Thank you
[2:20:48] <%bigdumbidiotguy> lol
[2:20:49] <%ssjklyco> They ran out of budget I guess
[2:20:52] <CursedNobleman> does resident evil ever do anything with those door animations? or is it just to create dread
[2:20:54] <%Grayhammatter> EZ
[2:20:56] <BeefyQueefer> pootrick boibum smeels
[2:21:00] <senfood> @PkSilent01 Because the son was an insane genius and really liked puzzles.
[2:21:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I remember the first time i blew the fuck u0
[2:21:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @BeefyQueefer D:
[2:21:08] <%natebud> It's really unimpressive. I was dissappointed at how long it takes to explode
[2:21:09] <superd4v3> @CursedNobleman It just creates dread, that's all
[2:21:12] <KSGregg> Highlight
[2:21:12] <Kristoffers> Eleva Thor from the MCU
[2:21:15] <teflonbilly777> @CursedNobleman They were loading screens in teh original games
[2:21:17] <SparkAfterDark> @Tersalus Thing is monster turned into people. Fly is people turning into monster. The visuals might be similar but your reaction is probably due to the context, which is very different.
[2:21:21] <ShibuyaTomato> @CursedNobleman there's at least one time thery lead to a jumpscare
[2:21:22] <%senordingdong2> THere have been a couple zombie attacks in a door animation
[2:21:24] <%natebud> clean
[2:21:24] <PkSilent01> @senfood ok that makes senses
[2:21:25] <%heroicspiritavenger> @CursedNobleman I want to say in the original RE1 you have RNG Zombies in loading doors
[2:21:26] <%DappercatEsquire> I really like Five Guys but I'm not gonna build my fuckin house out of it.
[2:21:27] <%bigdumbidiotguy> the first playthrough of this game back on release took me 10 hrs
[2:21:37] <$crusader_heide> Do the guys ever talk to Matt anymore?
[2:21:47] <MachineHead9> @CursedNobleman it was loading times for the ps1 when it came out now it's just nostalgia
[2:21:47] <%Taisuru> apatGib apatDab
[2:21:49] <%hussdogrob> why are we not watching Yakuza 7!?!?
[2:21:49] <%heroicspiritavenger> @crusader_heide WHO?
[2:21:51] <CursedNobleman> @teflonbilly777 ooooh, clever
[2:21:57] <%bigdumbidiotguy> 90 frogs hopping down the street
[2:21:57] <Tersalus> @sparkafterdark oh shit hold on, that got deep quick
[2:22:03] <%senordingdong2> Finishing early is my specialty. I like to win in bed, so to speak.
[2:22:05] <%necrocannibal2> this is one of those games where your first playthrough takes 15hrs, but the next ones take 5
[2:22:05] <%ha2ken> Those old computer beep boops are so good
[2:22:09] <Texascourierlive> we saved de urth
[2:22:16] <Tersalus> @sparkafterdark wow I think you're right
[2:22:17] <TalisKanju> @crusader_heide I thought that name was banned in chat?
[2:22:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> but if you started late and you finish on time, then you're finished early. because FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY that's why
[2:22:19] <ryguy554556> I just beat this game as chris today
[2:22:24] <teflonbilly777> @SparkAfterDark @Tersalus You are iterally seeing Seth Brundle deteriorate and take evolutionary steps backwards in record time. Like when he has to regurgitate stomach acid on things to eat them
[2:22:26] <$crusader_heide> @heroicspiritavenger lol my bad
[2:22:30] <%Taisuru> apatGib apatDab apatWhat apatDab_HF apatGib_HF
[2:22:33] <%necrocannibal2> @crusader_heide I think he talks to Woolie sometimes on Twitter
[2:22:36] <SMuffinMan> 5 hours? That's a lot

[2:22:39] <%LymanAl> apatBlep_SG apatBlep_SG apatBlep_SG
[2:22:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Any bonus game / content? (Like "The Mercenaries"? etc)
[2:22:49] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what happens if you use all the rockets but miss the Tyrant man
[2:22:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> MAGNUM
[2:22:52] <%ForlornCarton> do you have enough magnum ammo to finish the game with just that?
[2:22:54] <$crusader_heide> @necrocannibal2 gotcha
[2:22:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> Who is stronger? this Tyrant or Mr.X?
[2:23:00] <%Puhff> Hello, I am back
[2:23:01] <Texascourierlive> jesus crist pat
[2:23:05] <%Grayhammatter> the mugnum revolver
[2:23:07] <%Melodic_Mane> are you going to use any of your tony montana branded healing cocaine?
[2:23:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I started playing this game in 1996 and still haven't finished it.
[2:23:17] <+Ilpala> I mean one survived a molten metal bath
[2:23:17] <SMuffinMan> Super Mr. X is stronger
[2:23:21] <ryguy554556> Nemesis stronger than both
[2:23:25] <Texascourierlive> I think you are prepared
[2:23:27] <%DappercatEsquire> Jeff Mangum revolver
[2:23:31] <$crusader_heide> "staaaaaarrss....."
[2:23:32] <%bigdumbidiotguy> make sure you get the Mine Thrower @angriestpat
[2:23:32] <%ssjklyco> Jill at the end of the game: I'm here to deliver your Valentine
[2:23:37] <teflonbilly777> @GalacticaPhanto Mr X. This Tyrant isn't even finished cooking
[2:23:42] <%spongeofmystery> GET READY FOR MONGO
[2:23:48] <Ner234> @ssjklyco Boooo
[2:23:52] <$crusader_heide> FORGET THAT SHIT
[2:23:56] <%LymanAl> Cue battle theme
[2:23:56] <BoneofMalkav> Enough of that shit, here comes Mongo!
[2:23:57] <$crusader_heide> HERE COMES MONGO
[2:23:59] <SMuffinMan> Yep Mr. X survived basically lava
[2:24:00] <%Melodic_Mane> oh shit, it's time for tyrant time
[2:24:01] <teflonbilly777> MONGO JUST A PAWN IN LIFE
[2:24:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> M O N G O
[2:24:08] <FatherGreyBeard> is chris alive?
[2:24:10] <Ner234> Noooo
[2:24:11] <person181> best dude barry
[2:24:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> these motherfuckers ain't the droids you're looking for.
[2:24:14] <Texascourierlive> The shit storm begins
[2:24:15] <%DappercatEsquire> Why did he walk into frame like such a fuckin dope
[2:24:15] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Hey guys it's me tYrant. time to kill the valentine
[2:24:16] <%misha_kastrilevich> is Barry the traitor?
[2:24:17] <ryguy554556> I just finished this as chris today
[2:24:25] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah Chris is Alive
[2:24:29] <%Melodic_Mane> barry reminds me of my dad, as in he's not real
[2:24:30] <%SoFarFetched> He's been for awhile LUL
[2:24:33] <%Ganerumo> Gotta give it to Barry that he's got some fucking balls
[2:24:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i wanna barry my dicc in jills ass
[2:24:35] <%Typhaeon> Barold the MVP
[2:24:36] <teflonbilly777> DAT LIGHTING
[2:24:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Barry is the best of us.
[2:24:44] <%senordingdong2> So why the healing items" If getting bitten isn't canon, then pouring healing items into a zone defeats the permanency of mistake. As much as a I hate the run-and-hide modus of new horror games, what they have right is the playe's inability to take damage. It drives home the sense of permanency.
[2:24:46] <JackKrauser> And here comes the TWIST.
[2:24:46] <misterspotswood> god i love barry, i wish i was him
[2:24:48] <Tersalus> Barry cant be the traitor, that shot was done by a PROFESSIONAL
[2:24:49] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Barry's favorite food is Berries

[2:29:11] <Guardiansaiyan> @InugamiTheHound its more in tune to the creators intended VISION
[2:29:11] <%arcaderabbit48> How bad could these Tyrants be if one petite police woman can kill one with a grenade launcher?
[2:29:12] <%Melodic_Mane> all they did was get a tall dude, tape knifes to his hand and give him a cow heart, i could do that but the police say otherwise
[2:29:13] <%bigdumbidiotguy> PogChamp
[2:29:14] <%Tracazoid> Remember that time Wesker got killed by a door...no wait we try not to remember that.
[2:29:15] <teflonbilly777> I never finished Revelations 2. Is Wesker's sister any cool?
[2:29:22] <misterspotswood> no
[2:29:23] <$Jmann1892> Fun Fact: Barry's Magnum can One-Shot the Tyrant here
[2:29:24] <%bigdumbidiotguy> he killed the tyrant guys game over.
[2:29:24] <majima666> yeah, shoot wesker a couple of times to be sure
[2:29:25] <rytisone> Twist Weskers dick
[2:29:27] <JackKrauser> Check Wesker for a cool file.
[2:29:33] <ryguy554556> Wesker gets stabbed by tyrant if your playing as Chris.
[2:29:36] <%natebud> This is a great plan, I'm excited to be a part of it.
[2:29:39] <Hey_Vex> Excellent, Police Girl.

[2:29:49] <Huntercd> She's hot in a evil business lady kind of way
[2:29:52] <Joestar1890> Wesker tanked a shot from Barry's custom .44, you should probably shoot him more
[2:29:57] <%arcaderabbit48> @teflonbilly777 She's insane, obsessed with fear, and voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. So yeah, interesting at least
[2:29:58] <+BionoidLCR> @teflonbilly777 game dope, sister cute but lame
[2:30:06] <BeefyQueefer> use your words

[2:30:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I like how the research dates back to the 60's
[2:30:59] <TalisKanju> Wow, two name drops
[2:30:59] <$Jmann1892> Is the G-Virus better than the T-Veronica in your opinion @AngriestPat
[2:31:00] <Ner234> monkaS
[2:31:00] <+Ilpala> Yea you dumbass you just ran right at the shit
[2:31:00] <%tigerfang86> DA NAAAAAAA

[2:31:00] <%Keyd00d> Gone forever
[2:31:01] <PkSilent01> Whos Alexia
[2:31:03] <%Melodic_Mane> all wesker wanted was to be the realist OG
[2:31:05] <Huntercd> Alexia stayed hot as a Tyrant
[2:31:05] <$crusader_heide> BARRY? What are you doing here?????
[2:31:07] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat Weskers body in bioler room
[2:31:09] <DuoScratch> and Wesker'll NEVER BOTHER THEM AGAIN!
[2:31:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> wesker rolled into a conveniently placed escape hatch
[2:31:13] <%arcaderabbit48> @kingbaconcrispy Its like the only thing making CVX canon. Nothing important happens in that game
[2:31:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> cuz wesker
[2:31:13] <%Zebroneath> Double tap just to make sure LUL
[2:31:14] <%SolidusRex> I love the idea of Birkin having a bitter rivalry with an 11 year old
[2:31:15] <%ha2ken> *breathes in* Jill sandwich... *gasps for air*
[2:31:16] <$lotharrio> "Jill, real quick, shoot Wesker like fifteen times in the brain, then pull his head off from his body."
[2:31:18] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I'm back from lanipator stream!
[2:31:19] <Snektor> Magic of beards duh pat
[2:31:20] <%Aydarkzero> he used a herb duh Kappa
[2:31:20] <TalisKanju> Alexia was the last boss of Code Veronica
[2:31:23] <%natebud> CVX is a game you could delete entirely and it wouldn't change the larger story.
[2:31:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HE TelEPorTEd
[2:31:27] <Snektor> G
[2:31:28] <$RealThiele> G
[2:31:29] <JackKrauser> G.
[2:31:31] <%Keyd00d> G
[2:31:32] <%Solidnick18> g
[2:31:32] <%gespenst25> He was in the other compartment of the coffin
[2:31:39] <MachineHead9> it's T-Veronica
[2:31:40] <CursedNobleman> las plagas #1
[2:31:42] <Lagseene> hi chat
[2:31:43] <%TheSphereHunter> my favorite self destruct voice
[2:31:44] <%arcaderabbit48> G gives you eyes on the outside
[2:31:45] <%DappercatEsquire> Being a person seems good
[2:31:46] <%kingbaconcrispy> @arcaderabbit48 Wesker has cool glasses. That's what happened and incest.
[2:31:47] <%tigerfang86> Not become a goo monster
[2:31:47] <$RealThiele> skelexia hot and skexy
[2:31:48] <Guardiansaiyan> T-Veronica
[2:31:49] <%Keyd00d> I don't want
[2:31:51] <%otakuisaiah> otakuisaiah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Almost 2 years of having $5 stealthily getting airlifted from my Bank to yours. Keep up the hard (?) work. Snapple Real Fact #935: Newborn babies cannot cry tears for three weeks.
[2:31:51] <%tigerfang86> or being ULTIMATE POWER
[2:31:53] <%Melodic_Mane> what about the fire powers though pat lol
[2:31:54] <Snektor> But if you control G well enough you could theroetically evolve constantly
[2:31:54] <%senordingdong2> apatWhat
[2:31:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> T vERnoica only works after being frozen FOR FUCKIN YEARS
[2:31:55] <%Dagman72> Dagman72 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:31:56] <%tigerfang86> it's a hard trade off
[2:31:58] <+DRAGKUDO> yo what about chris
[2:31:58] <%natebud> Or turn into a big green version of yourself with dumb hair like Steve
[2:31:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it tho?
[2:31:59] <%Ranryu692> only if you like being a person
[2:32:01] <@commanderclaw> Wesker's RE5 shit is clearly the best, all the bonuses and only evil eyes
[2:32:02] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what about the C-Virus?
[2:32:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @kingbaconcrispy Again I ask, what's with Umbrella and all the incest
[2:32:05] <%Zebroneath> I'd rather stay a person. I don't want 100 giant eyeballs.
[2:32:07] <%sporeian94> What about COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[2:32:07] <+KaijuUltimax> Nah just become a feral goo monster
[2:32:07] <$lotharrio> T-Veronica vs Wesker's virus.
[2:32:08] <majima666> nah, i want the big dumb eyeball and exposed heart for life though
[2:32:08] <teflonbilly777> Uroboros had COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION though
[2:32:09] <DSD24> What about Yuri Lowenthal in Rev 2?
[2:32:09] <%DappercatEsquire> Which virus turns you into an immortal toilet?
[2:32:09] <%LaughingCatt> the obvious answer is to throw all of them in a blender & drink it
[2:32:10] <ShibuyaTomato> yeah but you're just gonna mutate at the end anyway
[2:32:10] <Neo_Kaiser> What if the G virus lets you stay as a person?
[2:32:11] <%Jekado> is oroboros different i forget?
[2:32:12] <JackKrauser> The correct answer was Wesker's virus. But yes.
[2:32:13] <%Solidnick18> seems boring
[2:32:14] <%Tracazoid> Yes but biomutant, clearly the superior option
[2:32:15] <Joestar1890> Wasn't G killed from an explosion not the nuke?
[2:32:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @XeroSigmaPrime the BENEFITS tho!
[2:32:15] <%Keyd00d> ow my ass
[2:32:16] <%Agami23> the c-virus lets you turn into a dinosaur, then a panther, then back into a person
[2:32:16] <majima666> ya gotta commit to your mutation
[2:32:17] <%MoralCompassGaming> What about the Version Alice got? which was that? ill take some of that
[2:32:18] <theaterunderground> true
[2:32:19] <+teambucky> Golgotha
[2:32:20] <TalisKanju> The C Virus is the best virus in these games - can do fucking anything
[2:32:21] <APB_Harleqyn> Don't we have to find Chris?
[2:32:22] <oniwahoo> One could say getting to stay a person is the best possible benefit of any of these viruses
[2:32:22] <%natebud> use the magnum you coward
[2:32:24] <%Solidnick18> i wanna be a huge monster
[2:32:24] <+Draegen86> So what justification was there for Wesker's infection not fully taking over and him staying Wesker?
[2:32:28] <Tersalus> can I just stay normal but kept the extra eyes?
[2:32:34] <Snektor> Is the C virus the Chris virus?
[2:32:34] <%kingbaconcrispy> @arcaderabbit48 It's a long term plan.
[2:32:35] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat what does wesker inject into himself?
[2:32:38] <+BionoidLCR> i wanna be like re5 wesker
[2:32:39] <%Melodic_Mane> what about t-abyss? Kappa
[2:32:43] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Uroboros gives you a .01% chance of melding with it perfectly, otherwise you get fucked
[2:32:43] <Heartless_01> i dont think G's hosts can be controlled like the T ones
[2:32:44] <%misha_kastrilevich> G virus gives birth to cooler monsters like the lickers
[2:32:45] <%Keyd00d> what about the D-virus Kappa
[2:32:47] <$RealThiele> jill needs sesame street tech
[2:32:50] <%Jjrossman> Fuckin EVA beep
[2:32:52] <%arcaderabbit48> @Draegen86 He's a test tube baby, and he has special medicine that keeps him from breakign down
[2:32:55] <%sporeian94> JILL DON'T LET ME DIE I GOTTA MAKE SURE CLAIRE PASSES ON THE BLOODLINE BEFORE I PASS
[2:32:56] <%BayowolfTerra> Las plagas is pretty good if youre a controller
[2:32:56] <$RealThiele> HGH Wesker
[2:32:59] <teflonbilly777> RE5 Wesker and his badass Matrix moves
[2:32:59] <Joestar1890> There's a very low chance that you'll become a super human like Wesker, and you need to take shots daily
[2:33:00] <Neo_Kaiser> What if someone creates the Pat virus? The P-virus.
[2:33:02] <Huntercd> G is just incest in viral form
[2:33:02] <TalisKanju> The C-Virus can turn people into clones of other Resident Evil characters
[2:33:03] <%natebud> PCP
[2:33:03] <EASrake> Umbrella cult
[2:33:04] <%MoralCompassGaming> What about Alice?
[2:33:07] <deltakuma009> what was the virus from the dark side chronicles and the umbrella chronicles?
[2:33:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PDF
[2:33:08] <+Draegen86> @arcaderabbit48 ah, gotcha - thank you
[2:33:12] <TalisKanju> The C-Virus
[2:33:12] <JackKrauser> It's interesting how HCF was mentioned in RE7.
[2:33:14] <PkSilent01> i thought it was call oroborus?
[2:33:14] <StygianBarba> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[2:33:15] <$RealThiele> alice has plot virus armor
[2:33:17] <Kristoffers> Wesker's seems alright until tentacles
[2:33:20] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how strong does it make him?
[2:33:21] <%Zebroneath> Now Jill and Chris can (not) fuck
[2:33:24] <Joestar1890> I thought it was Ouroboros that Wesker was infected with
[2:33:25] <teflonbilly777> WHAT ABOUT REBECCA?
[2:33:26] <$lotharrio> I mentally call it E virus. For Emperor. Because Capcom also uses Emperor and Tyrant in the Breath of Fire series for the strongest dragon forms.
[2:33:26] <misterspotswood> that man needs more muscle
[2:33:27] <rytisone> Christhisway
[2:33:27] <%Melodic_Mane> the best virus is obviously the influenza virus
[2:33:28] <%Typhaeon> Alice's version requires you to woo & marry a schlocky action director
[2:33:30] <%Aydarkzero> THERE'S NO TIME
[2:33:31] <%Erimos> He uses PG67A/W in RE5.
[2:33:31] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Hunk likes Pineapple on his pizza
[2:33:33] <DuoScratch> they'll TALK...LATER!
[2:33:33] <%arcaderabbit48> @kingbaconcrispy Is it?? Because incest isnt good in the long or short term!
[2:33:33] <$RealThiele> Jillno
[2:33:33] <AMaidIndeed> Ahhh it can wait
[2:33:34] <%natebud> there's no time
[2:33:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nah its fineee
[2:33:35] <%NovaKnightmare> "Wesker's your rival now"
[2:33:36] <Joestar1890> Nahhh talk later
[2:33:37] <%Agami23> remember when there was like 20 weskers?
[2:33:37] <%Tracazoid> CGS-The Complete Global Saturation virus.
[2:33:38] <%ha2ken> It's fine...
[2:33:39] <MachineHead9> yeah it was called the Wesker project and mostly everyone died from it
[2:33:39] <%spongeofmystery> Believe it's referred to as the "prototype virus" and that's it
[2:33:41] <%shiplord13> Nah, why would it matter
[2:33:41] <%CalderGaming> @PkSilent01 wesker didn't use ouroboros on himself until late in 5, i think
[2:33:45] <TalisKanju> can also turn you into a Transformer that changes from a human to a house
[2:33:45] <%Jane_Lo> You get different cutscene if you visit him befor everything
[2:33:46] <%DappercatEsquire> Hey what did they end up using the los plagas for?
[2:33:47] <Guardiansaiyan> @Joestar1890 the Uroboros virus needs continuous injections...the Projenitor Virus Wesker gets here does not
[2:33:51] <Huntercd> Fuck already
[2:33:52] <TalisKanju> sized dinosaur
[2:33:53] <rytisone> I think he knows, he put Chris in there
[2:33:54] <%MoralCompassGaming> @Typhaeon That's too high a price, i want to stay a person
[2:33:56] <Tersalus> I'm really appreciating these camera angles
[2:33:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> shiit
[2:34:01] <%natebud> Wesker locked him in there so...
[2:34:07] <$RealThiele> shadow teleport
[2:34:07] <%NovaKnightmare> he teleported
[2:34:07] <oniwahoo> Pat stop asking questions!
[2:34:08] <%Aydarkzero> zombies helped
[2:34:10] <%Melodic_Mane> lots of candy is my guess
[2:34:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> He TELepoRTed
[2:34:12] <%bigdumbidiotguy> in a big suitcade
[2:34:12] <AMaidIndeed> Ehhhhhh don't worry about it
[2:34:13] <$lotharrio> Keys and chloroform
[2:34:14] <%Jonopreno> Pre roids chris
[2:34:15] <@commanderclaw> Shut up tho
[2:34:15] <%Ranryu692> during the course of a door loading animation, no less
[2:34:17] <%senordingdong2> A lot of RE makes no sense, man
[2:34:18] <%lethallunacyx> He promised him a giant boulder
[2:34:18] <Guardiansaiyan> Wesker and Chris have UST
[2:34:18] <%Tearonex> THERE'S NO TIME
[2:34:18] <%Gogetta159> Im pretty sure Chris knows Wesker is evil, thats how he ends up there in the first place
[2:34:20] <majima666> the zombies and hunters and dogs were in on it
[2:34:20] <JackKrauser> Tempted him with a fake shooting range.
[2:34:22] <majima666> and spiders
[2:34:22] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat, of course, using his teleport powers.
[2:34:23] <%Rotanimood> He run really fast
[2:34:23] <%NovaKnightmare> this confirms the Teleport theory
[2:34:26] <%Agami23> he used the magic re0 elevator
[2:34:26] <rytisone> Wesker knows all secret passages
[2:34:28] <Joestar1890> @Guardiansaiyan OOOOOOH it was the Progenitor Virus, okay. Thanks.
[2:34:32] <halfstraight> chats moving so fast nobody will know that im gay
[2:34:37] <%bigdumbidiotguy> he eat da poopoo
[2:34:39] <%ssjklyco> How did Alfred survive bullets to the chest and a fall?
[2:34:39] <+callowbrodie> Wesker is evil?!?!
[2:34:40] <misterspotswood> gayyyyyyyyyy
[2:34:41] <%DappercatEsquire> @halfstraight u gay
[2:34:41] <%Aydarkzero> consistency in Resident Evil LUL
[2:34:41] <TalisKanju> Can't wait to see Pat play RE0
[2:34:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> He didn't teleport him, he just moved him really fast.
[2:34:44] <bugsmr> wesker lured chris with sex, obviously
[2:34:45] <%tigerfang86> had to do it to em
[2:34:45] <%arcaderabbit48> So was Chris off doing his whole half of the game seperately this whole time? Or what? Where is Rebecca?
[2:34:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wesker beat Chris in Teppen so he had to go to the Salty Cell
[2:34:51] <%mrcelab> Wait, what if you dont save Chris?
[2:34:51] <%BayowolfTerra> Wesker just used las plagas as a security force
[2:34:52] <devanmuse> what happened to rebecca chambers in this timeline?
[2:34:53] <%natebud> Pat: 1 Goblins: 0
[2:34:55] <Eldalu> panicBasket panicBasket
[2:34:55] <%Ranryu692> @bugsmr rofl
[2:34:56] <%kingbaconcrispy> Wow, crimson head with lab coat, never saw that.
[2:35:03] <teflonbilly777> Wesker had a secret dumbwaiter in the mansion
[2:35:07] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Goblins monkaS
[2:35:13] <FatherGreyBeard> @mrcelab he goes kablooey, i imagine
[2:35:14] <$crusader_heide> @halfstraight was gay all alonnng
[2:35:18] <Guardiansaiyan> @kingbaconcrispy that crimson head got a PHd in nom nom nom
[2:35:19] <%Melodic_Mane> final save? awww yeah
[2:35:23] <PkSilent01> so are the CG RE Movies cannon?
[2:35:24] <JackKrauser> End game time.
[2:35:27] <%kingbaconcrispy> @arcaderabbit48 It's to keep the blood pure!
[2:35:28] <%SoySocks> !uptime
[2:35:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:28] <%Aydarkzero> let's ROCK
[2:35:29] <%Solidnick18> the finale
[2:35:29] <Neo_Kaiser> Remember to leave one space free
[2:35:30] <$Jmann1892> All those rotated saves LUL
[2:35:31] <%silverira> I wonder why the RE 6 virus mutates ppl in such a weird way, I mean some become zombies others mutate and then there is Ada clone
[2:35:34] <Neo_Kaiser> In your inventory
[2:35:35] <%misha_kastrilevich> IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWN
[2:35:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PkSilent01 Yup
[2:35:41] <%Typhaeon> The only thing that ties this game to the time it came out is the overly desaturated, very brown color palette
[2:35:41] <%Solidnick18> FINAL TIME
[2:35:42] <Guardiansaiyan> @PkSilent01 more canon than the live action...but I don't think so
[2:35:44] <$RealThiele> a weapon to (not) rival metal gear
[2:35:45] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[2:35:46] <+Ilpala> @AngriestPat Start throwing taser batteries at him!
[2:35:48] <%NopeBadguy> C'MON C'MON
[2:35:49] <%natebud> Gee I hope my best buddy Wesker makes it out said Chris
[2:35:50] <%kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat Wait until there's 45 seconds left to use the flares!
[2:35:52] <%Solidnick18> He said the thing
[2:35:53] <Oxybe> latest temtem build looks spoopy.
[2:35:56] <%Anri02> I'm here now
[2:35:56] <Tucker0603> what about rebecca though?
[2:35:58] <%ha2ken> C'mon. Thanks.
[2:35:58] <teflonbilly777> I love the tiny beret
[2:35:59] <bleugh> SHEVA
[2:35:59] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what if brad.instead of giving you the rocket launcher just farts into a megaphone and says, "cya fucko"
[2:35:59] <%Animorphimagi> that noise is so annoying
[2:36:00] <Guardiansaiyan> CHICKEN HEART
[2:36:02] <majima666> chickenheart
[2:36:02] <Neo_Kaiser> I remember reading a game tip that said the final boss dies in one shot from the suicide gun.
[2:36:02] <%Jane_Lo> @PkSilent01 yes, they are, the degeneration connects re4 and re5, damnation also teasers re6
[2:36:03] <%BayowolfTerra> I think the movies are canon but unimportant
[2:36:10] <teflonbilly777> GODDAMMIT BRAD! WHERE AHVE YOU BEE YOU COWARD
[2:36:11] <Guardiansaiyan> Brad can't SEE
[2:36:14] <+twin_triggers> wait
[2:36:15] <%kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat If you wait you get the rocket launcher at 30 secs
[2:36:16] <%tigerfang86> FUCK YOU BRAD
[2:36:22] <Guardiansaiyan> he needs the daylight to have a backbone
[2:36:24] <TalisKanju> @silverira Virus fog transforms people into zombies, directly injecting it turns people into J'avo or Chrysalis Monsters
[2:36:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> ruh roh
[2:36:26] <%natebud> It warms his chicken heart
