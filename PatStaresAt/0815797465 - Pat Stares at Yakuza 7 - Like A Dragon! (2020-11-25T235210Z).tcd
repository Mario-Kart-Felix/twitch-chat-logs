[0:29:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> by the time i got to the tower i was grossly overpowered so i was fine with it
[0:29:14] <%griffball13> it's a QA lead
[0:29:15] <%the22cstomp> that was QA
[0:29:15] <Brandon__Brando> thats not good

[0:29:33] <%Chatterbox1991> mine was 255 or something
[0:29:36] <%mield916> thats not how he said that, he said he's played slowly
[0:29:36] <%baronouroboros> Forget Cyberpunk, let's play 13 Sentinels?
[0:29:37] <+zanzibar_junker> Its the Chrysler Building of Y7
[0:29:39] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yeah i bet that game is long as fuck

[0:29:41] <%real_life_ghost> FF7r will get most goty
[0:29:45] <rekinom> Good to hear the QA lead say they're not going to do all of the game
[0:29:51] <DrGasMax> it is also a game designed to play like 3 times
[0:29:52] <%Monkeyweed21> They get crunched too hard to do a 100% playthrough
[0:29:53] <TreesDontTalk> Cheer500 Hey Patrick-san What's your favorite fighting stance in Yakuza 0?

[0:33:04] <Solidnick18> but can you eat video games
[0:33:04] <MarvelousMrD> thanksgiving is when you get to see how racist your family is\
[0:33:05] <DrGasMax> You get good food at Thanksgiving if you family doesn't suck
[0:33:06] <%RoboticAnimeDude> true but thats not what its about lol

[0:33:10] <murdock_465> I'm not american, I second this
[0:33:11] <%Monkeyweed21> It started as a way to cheer up during the Civil War, so relevant @PatStaresAt
[0:33:12] <Pookiedaexzile> But the food tho
[0:33:12] <%UvBenServed> It's an excuse to eat a lot. Of course it's a big deal
[0:33:13] <brachydios777> But Food though!

[0:33:18] <%Jack8274> It's a day that people get together with family, and spread covid
[0:33:20] <%TheDullaMAN> Yeah, but it's a LOT of food
[0:33:20] <+michingmallecho> The stupid turkey pardon hasWut
[0:33:20] <%Kataguro> Most American households don't do Turkey at Christmas
[0:33:20] <%coreyyotto> but you get the food a month early
[0:33:25] <Solidnick18> eat the video games
[0:33:26] <Discount_CJ> I guess but eh
[0:33:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Less costly, just get together and eat.
[0:33:26] <%McSoliace> if your food wasnt shit maybe you'd like it more
[0:33:27] <%ShogunNoonto> no
[0:33:27] <cache_22> Thanksgiving is food, (American) football, and (racist) family.
[0:33:28] <%miguelrod777> Yeah the FOOD pat
[0:33:30] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> it's one of the days I can eat like an animal with no judgements

[0:33:31] <%Anime_Flux> lol this guy
[0:33:31] <%weissguard> People usually put in even more effort into American Thanksgiving food than Christmas food anyway.
[0:33:33] <AmericanaRed> Black friday 2020 = The Division ArgieB8
[0:33:34] <+teg88> relatives suck

[0:33:37] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:33:38] <DrGasMax> Americans love eating, it is an entire holiday dedicated to it
[0:33:39] <%TheMattman1313> The Puritans hated Christmas so they had to come up with a new food holiday
[0:33:40] <%snow_bush> Its 1 of 8 days we get off a year.
[0:33:41] <%baronouroboros> Let's do this?
[0:33:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Christmas food is different
[0:33:43] <baavetti> You dont eat turkey at xmas
[0:33:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Thanksgiving was made to cheer people up during the Civil War
[0:33:43] <%Yautjabutts> imagine visiting your relatives during a pandemic
[0:33:46] <%Dakuu75> lol
[0:33:47] <Captainflipsy> donald trump forgives turkey for gobble gobble crimes
[0:33:47] <%eyezehuhh> fuck them relatives
[0:33:49] <%coreyyotto> x-mas is immediate family, thanksgiving is extended family
[0:33:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> somebody streams overcooked right now
[0:33:53] <%Maids4lyfe> no pat relatives come over EVERY holiday in america
[0:33:54] <%Ascethetic> we dont celebrate our thanksgiving with Kraft Dinner

[0:34:21] <%baronouroboros> as a person living in Canada
[0:34:21] <+michingmallecho> I don’t understand why one day is okay to binge eat when everyday Americans eat more than they should anyway LUL
[0:34:22] <brachydios777> That’s neat
[0:34:25] <%ShogunNoonto> why not both

[0:34:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> You just cook turkey like shit
[0:34:59] <%TheMattman1313> A good portion of American traditions are us trying to do cool things once the Puritans ruined eveything with their "no fun allowed" mentality

[0:35:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates the day that John MacDonald defeated the God King of the Northern Wastes to rise as the first, and only true, Prime Minister.
[0:35:18] <%real_life_ghost> where I grew up we celebrated Christmas by being seiged by a skeleton horse demon who wanted to steal all my beer.

[0:46:01] <+pissdegaulle> it's blue
[0:46:02] <blue8moon> It is purple, but the different lighting makes it look a bit more blue
[0:46:03] <murdock_465> i don't believe you
[0:46:03] <%TheDullaMAN> Good job Pat
[0:46:03] <%baronouroboros> blind playthrough, yay
[0:46:05] <samcast1> P U R P
[0:46:06] <lastnamesilverlastname> How far are you in the story, Pat?
[0:46:08] <fIashman92> Look for shinies before you progress
[0:46:09] <%Treuan> Stop it by escalating more
[0:46:09] <%honeyman18> Lighting and colors are hard to teach people like the dress meme
[0:46:09] <NitronStreams> what no grinding offscreen?! WHO ARE YOU
[0:46:12] <TheNewJapanGuy> COWARD
[0:46:16] <PkSilent01> oh he's still in chapter 5

[0:46:19] <%bluescreen1988> ???
[0:46:21] <%RoboticAnimeDude> oh yeyeye this part is pretty good
[0:46:22] <brachydios777> Sometimes when purple is dark enough it looks blue
[0:46:22] <GManx0> Didnt you escalate that conflict
[0:46:25] <agadejobi> So does Eri have absolutely nothing to do with the story?
[0:46:26] <%BoxNavy> how DID buttons 🤔
[0:46:29] <%BoneofMalkav> button how do?
[0:46:35] <tsnakesrule> started Ng+ Legend mode I'm getting my ass handed to at lvl 95 granted job lvls are 80 and lower
[0:46:36] <@SoFarFetched> @agadejobi no she's an optional party member
[0:46:37] <%Anime_Flux> Street Fighty-Fights II: Turbo
[0:46:46] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:46:47] <Spagheddies> @agadejobi Not in the slightest. She won't even appear in cutscenes.
[0:46:48] <%coreyyotto> you are in the no substory dimension right now
[0:46:49] <+CapnClassix> @Mildly_Eccentric That's good at least. My grandpa left everything to Grandma, who my uncle manipulated into essentially giving him nearly everything. People are so fucking shitty.
[0:46:50] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:46:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> At least we can get the dungeon reaction fresh
[0:46:53] <%FboyDaKing> GOD I LOVE THIS TRACK!
[0:46:57] <fIashman92> Look for "locker keys" for substory
[0:47:02] <%FboyDaKing> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:47:03] <%McSoliace> will your recent changes effect this games colors too?
[0:47:07] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> make sure there are no unique enemies for the sujidex for this section of the game. It just feels like it.
[0:47:08] <%roscoe_rosaline> Hell ye
[0:47:13] <+JazzyBongo> Feel the heat!
[0:47:15] <DrGasMax> WAIT THE GAME SUPPORTS PLAYSTATION BUTTON PROMPTS!?
[0:47:17] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt soon the full API will be availible and PC games can get the awesome rumble support
[0:47:19] <%Jekado> @agadejobi she doesn't even show up in the cutscenes i think Eri was a contestant winner to be in the game like some of the others
[0:47:19] <%McSoliace> this song bops everytime
[0:47:22] <agadejobi> I was hoping they could come up with excuses as for why she's not in story cutscenes
[0:47:33] <%MajorCrasher> does the haptic work? @patstaresat
[0:47:34] <SomersaultJustice> any costume mods for this game yet?
[0:47:39] <JaceDarkstar> whats the most recent things to happen? its been a minute since i watched

[0:47:48] <brachydios777> @drgasmax Well it dod release on playstation too
[0:47:50] <agadejobi> Also, you would think that Nanba would change his clothes, at least into a better looking version of his homeless outfit
[0:47:58] <brachydios777> *did
[0:47:58] <fIashman92> Look for "locker keys" to unlock substory
[0:48:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Do I see "Black Hat Wizard"?
[0:48:04] <%Jekado> @SomersaultJustice not yet but i only checked like a week ago they are modding it slowly
[0:48:04] <+JazzyBongo> lol wtf is this an rpg?
[0:48:07] <smuggleruncle> hopefully games now will have ps button prompts more often than never
[0:48:15] <fIashman92> Sorry
[0:48:16] <%cache_22> I just bought a 4K HDR TV and it's shocking how bad HDR support is on Windows 10.
[0:48:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> RIP
[0:48:25] <%reonome> LUL
[0:48:26] <DrGasMax> There is no option in the settings to change the button prompts
[0:48:28] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[0:48:29] <murdock_465> oh
[0:48:32] <%roscoe_rosaline> hah

[0:49:28] <watts121> it feel worse
[0:49:28] <%griffball13> it is stuttering
[0:49:29] <%cache_22> So Pat used the touchpad the way 99% of games do, like one big button.
[0:49:29] <DashXero> Just a little bit.

[0:49:45] <+SilverDevilfish> Night time eats the frames in this game for whatever reason
[0:49:46] <%BinaryFireball> mhmmm
[0:49:52] <Dao_Puppy> Is this the same one paige was using?
[0:49:52] <DrGasMax> Your framerate will drip when the game randomly decides to spawn 50 NPCs out of nowhere
[0:49:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> I play games on a chromebook dont ask me

[0:50:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> This is intense music for controller fiddling
[0:50:25] <brachydios777> @jazzybongo The main character loves Dragon Quest so the world is a rpg in his head sometimes

[1:21:55] <brachydios777> Zhao is even wearing a snake pattern
[1:21:59] <redrins> @otakon17 he was level 40 both times I went there but ye could be random I guess
[1:21:59] <huskarl_zap> Do the one in chinatown near your building
[1:21:59] <@SoFarFetched> @Captain_Doomsday it's not Kamurocho
[1:22:03] <%MajorCrasher> @captain_doomsday this is yokohama a different city
[1:22:04] <watts121> Yeah you should probably grind some levels in the Dungeon cuz the difficulty spike is about to come up in the next chapter I believe.
[1:22:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hell yeah
[1:22:06] <fIashman92> New secret shop in top right

[1:22:20] <%Garthunox> Yeah pretty much
[1:22:21] <%honeyman18> Whatever, go with the Flow
[1:22:21] <DrGasMax> It is because of all the NPCs
[1:22:21] <%aram909> hamakita park drops frames hard
[1:22:22] <%doomunderthestairs> majh
[1:22:22] <%Blackleafx> crowds?
[1:22:22] <SomeOtherNeb> it must be on your end, there hasn't been any update since release
[1:22:23] <%doomunderthestairs> nah
[1:22:24] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[1:22:26] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Maybe turn off V-Sync
[1:22:26] <otakon17> It's the park
[1:22:27] <+reallybigrocks> Too many lights i guess
[1:22:27] <+SilverDevilfish> Night time eats the frames
[1:22:27] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh, Yakuza not in Kamurocho is weird but I guess it's not Kiryu
[1:22:27] <%tommy2mato> This park is super expensive
[1:22:28] <%coreyyotto> the park and the mall street are really intensive
[1:22:29] <colzack_> Could be nighttime
[1:22:32] <%aram909> its the worst area in the game
[1:22:34] <Louie_Salmon> The park is also not the best
[1:22:35] <%aram909> framerate wise
[1:22:36] <huskarl_zap> Its the cars i think
[1:22:36] <+dante_must_die_exe> RTX Park LUL
[1:22:37] <brachydios777> MAYBE
[1:22:38] <otakon17> for some reason the park has a lower framerate than the other areas due to the grass
[1:22:39] <%coreyyotto> like on ps4 this area has so much popin
[1:22:44] <+ek117> @pat you know you could do the Kart minigame up until near completion with an un upgraded first kart right?

[1:25:41] <bettysharkface> Wait I went to the door to get a pizza delivery, how did we end up kart racing?
[1:25:44] <+reallybigrocks> How does this control because it looks not great
[1:25:45] <%AzureGale> SAY MY NAAAAAAAAAME
[1:25:46] <+SilverDevilfish> the eagle eye view actually makes it easier
[1:25:51] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Mario Kart's starting line boost trick also work in Dragon Kart.
[1:25:52] <%Blackleafx> this track is a banger
[1:26:00] <SomeAsianDood> @bettysharkface its yakuza
[1:26:01] <otakon17> @bettysharkface the story scene just ended and we doing Substories now
[1:26:06] <LuckyLagomorph> it controls well enough
[1:26:06] <%ek117> @reallybigrocks as well as it needs to
[1:26:08] <%starzo0> @bettysharkface very easily
[1:26:11] <%cache_22> The driving is actually not that bad, it's kind of stiff but fine.
[1:26:12] <%gnarly_memes_bro> its a little earlier in this
[1:26:12] <otakon17> Dragon Kart is LEGIT really good
[1:26:12] <+CapnClassix> That drifting makes me think of Crash Team Racing
[1:26:14] <%ek117> two appears
[1:26:14] <+SilverDevilfish> when the 1 appears
[1:26:15] <+Javaa01> You gotta start revving at the end of 1 being on the screen
[1:26:16] <%StaceMcGate> its when 1 appears @PatStaresAt
[1:26:16] <$lotharrio> It's when the go shows up
[1:26:16] <%Starotter70> As soon as 3 appears
[1:26:17] <%Jekado> i think starts
[1:26:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> FADES
[1:26:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> When 2 starts to fade, basically
[1:26:20] <tsnakesrule> when 2 gone
[1:26:21] <%Jekado> i think on the 2
[1:26:22] <+chase959> it's bom bom bom press
[1:26:23] <%Ascethetic> as it is fading
[1:26:23] <nimbus272> you gotta do it a little after the 1 appears
[1:26:24] <otakon17> I don't think the Mario Kart start trick applies to this
[1:26:26] <%BoxNavy> 3 :)
[1:26:27] <KaironFortressKnight> No as soon as the countdown is over
[1:26:27] <Maleicus> a little after it begins to fade
[1:26:30] <+chase959> on the half
[1:26:30] <KnightAsteran> I hold it the entire countdown and it qorks
[1:26:30] <bettysharkface> NotLikeThis This game
[1:26:32] <SomeOtherNeb> how is Paige btw? I missed last night's stream
[1:26:34] <fIashman92> I do it when 2 first appears
[1:26:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> Chat doesn't seem to know LUL
[1:26:37] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> when it appears.
[1:26:38] <+possumwalsh1221> The exact second 3 appears
[1:26:38] <otakon17> because I tried it multiple times and got nothing
[1:26:44] <+CrimKangaroo> this karting looks like it feels very seriou slow. anyone played it and have insight?
[1:26:44] <thestoreemporium> so does the kart get harder at all?
[1:26:47] <%Starotter70> Gotta hold it down the whole time
[1:26:48] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I've been getting it on the solid 2
[1:26:52] <%megaotter> now this is pod racing!
[1:26:52] <+reallybigrocks> @reallybigrocks fair enough lol

[1:29:27] <brachydios777> DAYTONA
[1:29:28] <thestoreemporium> LETS GO AWAY
[1:29:31] <hassanico2> Bowser Cart
[1:29:32] <SomeOtherNeb> default upgrade to max is good enough to win the whole thing
[1:29:35] <%honeyman18> Bowsers cart
[1:29:41] <otakon17> High speed, crap turning
[1:29:42] <KaironFortressKnight> Rapid Phantom was my go to
[1:29:43] <%cache_22> Those kart token shop weapons are the base weapons for the strongest weapons in the game (pre-upgrade).
[1:29:44] <otakon17> VERY tanky
[1:29:44] <+CrimKangaroo> as they Genki Sudo walk away
[1:29:44] <@StridentSong> Rapid Phatom was my favorite
[1:29:45] <%AzureGale> DATOOOOOOOONAAAAAAA, LET'S GO AWAY
[1:29:46] <%KineKithZen> Don't bother, a better one unlocks after
[1:29:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> Rapid Phantom gets FOUR boosts when fully upgraded
[1:29:48] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Pretty Microphone. It upgrades to the Idol's best weapon.
[1:29:48] <Zarkith> Those are UNUPGRADED stats, too
[1:29:48] <+Javaa01> @MayorRev Yeah he already unlocked the Vocational School
[1:29:49] <GustauveVIII> PHANOTOM
[1:29:56] <%KineKithZen> I used Golden Phalanx until the last one
[1:29:57] <+CherteuseKapibara> Default is enough to beat every race (just upgrade)
[1:29:57] <redrins> the next one is real good
[1:29:58] <otakon17> Crimson Fire
[1:30:01] <fIashman92> Phantom only works in a map with boost items
[1:30:02] <KingVantq> The Kart that can dodge those fucking chomp chomps

[1:30:07] <%Blackleafx> Kappa
[1:30:07] <hassanico2> Rapid Phantom seems kinda bad?
[1:30:07] <@StridentSong> Drifts like a dream and gets 4x Turbo boosts
[1:30:07] <Maleicus> no
[1:30:08] <GustauveVIII> 4x speed boost is why its good
[1:30:08] <SomeOtherNeb> look at him with his measly 4 millions
[1:30:10] <SaltyAzteca> LODESAMONE
[1:30:12] <Monkey_D_Judd> I used phantom to destroy all of the time trials.
[1:30:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> 4 BOOSTS coxPog
[1:30:14] <hassanico2> Like that top speed is shitty no?
[1:30:16] <%BoxNavy> please get new song music
[1:30:16] <$lotharrio> Well according to the hero phone app, there's seven total, so I guess the last one is the best.
[1:30:17] <Fefe41> WHALE

[1:30:20] <%cache_22> Fully upgraded Crimson Fire is what I stuck with for all of these.
[1:30:24] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> the top speed is terrible though
[1:30:25] <%megaotter> pw pat
[1:30:29] <fIashman92> Some maps don't have boost items though
[1:30:31] <otakon17> oh Pat you sweet babby man, five million is PITTANCE in this game

[1:36:30] <%LuckyLagomorph> chef Nanba is really good
[1:36:31] <watts121> It's really hard to play musician when you realize it's just a shitty version of Devil Rocker.
[1:36:33] <+AbnormalVoid> I really wish they gave you the ability to change jobs everywhere after some point
[1:36:40] <otakon17> @Brickston yeah she's a heavier hitter than Saeko, who's speedier and better with buffing generally
[1:36:44] <Dr00_PhD> MP drain

[2:54:15] <otakon17> that's just materials
[2:54:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This guy sells wood but not water?

[2:54:43] <fIashman92> EXP up drinks
[2:54:43] <%Yautjabutts> He probably doesn't sell the super high tier stuff
[2:54:43] <%AzureGale> Don't forget to treasure hunt. jk
[2:54:44] <%StaceMcGate> Pat, the Kappa
[2:54:46] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Doesn't it say Ice Cream on his truck?
[2:54:51] <wrydiculous> good ol vending machine
[2:54:52] <%condemned_15> Every time I see that Ferris Wheel I think of the ED to Inuyasha
[2:54:55] <%Starotter70> "Here's some Desani"
[2:55:01] <%honeyman18> Ka ppa in the food truck
[2:55:10] <otakon17> Here's some Aquafina
[2:55:25] <KaironFortressKnight> @Starotter70 "I asked for water, not DEVIL'S SWEAT"

[2:55:42] <%Razputin217> I asked for Poland Spring! I’ll kill you!
[2:55:47] <+NYCrownlessKing> persona 5 - if only i didnt stop that rape from happening.
[2:55:47] <%StebTheVee> Ignorance is bliss
[2:55:49] <hassanico2> I mean that's not really the message
[2:55:50] <Ranko2Danko> hits too close to home
[2:55:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> NEVER ROCK THE BOAT
[2:55:51] <fIashman92> Is that a common theme?
[2:55:52] <%Broken_Sonex> If ONLY I just let it happen....
[2:55:52] <dinnydanny777> Here in the west we just don't write those stories :)
[2:55:54] <thestoreemporium> i dont feel like that was the takeaway
[2:55:54] <%thegreatsun> Pat, japan is not Western world, game is fiction
[2:55:54] <$Skelemungus> persona 5
[2:55:56] <%T_Sasquatch> Yea well life sucks when you do the good thing sometimes
[2:55:56] <%Kataguro> He's not WRONG, and he doesn't regret it anyway
[2:55:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> then i wouldnt have become a phantom thief
[2:55:57] <%condemned_15> Yeah the Japanese are kinda fucked up
[2:56:01] <%AzureGale> YOU ARE LITTLE BABY
[2:56:01] <jorniev> ITS TRUE THOUGH
[2:56:03] <shieldecho> Fuck, that's Mista's backstory as well...
[2:56:07] <TheFilth> Yeah I really didn't get that impression
[2:56:08] <uncle_speeps> i recently found out that this dude was in yakuza 2
[2:56:13] <supergoblinpunch> If only I was blind to Justice
[2:56:14] <hassanico2> This is literally just Weinstein you people, don't pretend this is some Japan exclusive thing
[2:56:15] <%T_Sasquatch> People have died trying to defend strangers
[2:56:18] <dan_g_v> gotta encourage cowardice
[2:56:21] <meteor530> Most ppl wouldn't do anything to prevent the situation.
[2:56:23] <primarch_lupercal> literally every korean story that involves a club or party involves sleaze as well. seems to be a trend
[2:56:25] <alwayspronking> is this.... the old lady on the moped from 3??
[2:56:26] <KaironFortressKnight> I loved Il. He was the illest.
[2:56:26] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Witnessing Rape is a Classic Anime troupe
[2:56:31] <akitanito> oh boy
[2:56:40] <xbb1024> That subquest probably was based on Weinstein
[2:56:42] <%reonome> winter sonata is a real show
[2:56:45] <mayiplay> Instant Transmission much?
[2:56:46] <hassanico2> Like seriously, the biggest scandal of Hollywood last few years was this
[2:56:47] <OsakaMatt> omg irl reference?!?
[2:56:53] <@SoFarFetched> NOW KITH
[2:56:55] <%ClericOfSparda> Dude, his puke is like *right there*
[2:56:56] <%reonome> LUL
[2:56:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That's why you gotta sexually assault the rapist. Culture prevents him from reporting it.
[2:56:58] <%Nomenanza> crimes of sexual nature in japan are barely paid attention to by the authorities, that's why the reported sexual offense rate is lower there when in actuality that is for the reason of them just not doing anything about them.
[2:56:58] <thestoreemporium> oh man k dramas
[2:57:00] <%AzureGale> "I love you." "I know"
[2:57:00] <%baka_sugoi> K Drama.sxs

[2:59:39] <akitanito> he forgot to post on twitter
[2:59:43] <h0wiewong> Well I think the take was, "Maybe not punch him"
[2:59:46] <DarkVinceX> quick,get your personer
[2:59:50] <LocalRobyn> haHAA
[2:59:51] <%Xevtes> how fucking stupid. hero's guilt

[2:59:56] <cipher758> cold pragmatism or justice

[3:00:13] <%kewlmyc> It is a baggy sweater
[3:00:13] <%Dakuu75> WTF was the moral of that story suppose to be?

[3:00:46] <akitanito> if you need to beat up someone, call for someone named Kiryu or Majima

[3:00:53] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, yakuza matriarch
[3:00:53] <silver__viii> It's less "i wish I hadn't done the right thing" and more "I'm bemoaning my circumstances instead of moving on"
[3:00:54] <Blank9> eri is amazing as dealer
[3:00:54] <%AzureGale> Sexy matriarch
[3:00:56] <%Xevtes> @Dakuu75 its inadvertently saying assault is good, which is disgusting

[3:01:33] <ClarentMordred> matriarch is a physical dps a couple useful support skills too, the level one character skill you get from it is also pretty useful @PatStaresAt
[3:01:33] <silver__viii> @xerioes hardly, it's saying he needs to move on instead of whining about what he used to have
[3:01:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Night Queen is a prostitute right
[3:01:39] <GandhiTheTerrible> LUL
[3:01:40] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt But are the hats tiny?

[3:01:45] <fIashman92> Dude those short shorts
[3:01:46] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Skrillex still relevant?
[3:01:47] <%StaceMcGate> Skrillex hasn't been relevant for years
[3:01:48] <@commanderclaw> You can often tell how good a JRPG is by how much it's basic battle theme is a banger
[3:01:49] <otakon17> shame Thumbtack Scatter isn't a cross class skill
[3:01:50] <%solracc25> ded

[3:02:21] <%Xevtes> @Dakuu75 its crazy that it got approved
[3:02:21] <$lotharrio> Eri is a murder-machine.
[3:02:23] <dinnydanny777> Skrillex is relevant solely because he is the new Kingdom Hearts musician guy
[3:02:23] <otakon17> he HITS LIKE A TRUCK
[3:02:25] <meteor530> Who'da thunk thumbtacks could be so hazardous
[3:02:30] <redrins> het damage as night queen is even more ridiculous
[3:02:32] <silver__viii> those tacks are fucking crazy
[3:02:32] <%Joe2187> The Devil rocker is better for Nanba

[3:02:57] <$lotharrio> Shadow Stitch is great.
[3:02:58] <akitanito> thumbtacks are just flechette rounds
[3:03:00] <black_pariah> if shes caught up on level, why is the gear still on
[3:03:00] <%LuckyLagomorph> that's a good one
[3:03:00] <%ThatMLPgamer> Shadow STITCH pat
[3:03:02] <Zarkith> That move Eri just unlocked is SUPER good
[3:03:02] <meteor530> SHadowsnitch....how...white
[3:03:03] <invader_rin> This part
[3:03:07] <%JaydenSai> Stitch but thats fine
[3:03:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> That's Eri's 2nd character skill, so you can switch her now. Although you'd lose THUMBTACKS

[3:04:39] <%ThatMLPgamer> But
[3:04:40] <$lotharrio> @PatStaresAt You'll want to save up 50 of the crests for a later thing. Make purchases with them with that in mind.
[3:04:40] <$Skelemungus> former tojo huh?
[3:04:44] <BrownMcgee> Is this gonna be majima or something
[3:04:47] <+zzNamttamzz> They add new things to buy in later chapter
[3:04:47] <brachydios777> The arms being in the ears is pretty smart
[3:04:48] <thestoreemporium> damn
[3:04:49] <fIashman92> Mouth Guard cuts MP cost by 20%

[3:05:10] <Oxybe> Mini Medal King! From Dragon Quest! In Yakuzi form!
[3:05:16] <%Jekado> these kinda suck the only good thing i feel is maybe the mouth guard which reduces MP use by 20 percent
[3:05:21] <h0wiewong> Oh the Sakura Storm
[3:05:22] <%Jekado> and some later stuff unlocks
[3:05:24] <%Kataguro> You need that Sakura Storm for the Bodyguard's Ultima Weapon

[3:05:27] <GandhiTheTerrible> Sakura Storm PogChamp
[3:05:33] <$lotharrio> @PatStaresAt You'll want to sav eup 50 of the crests for a later thing.

[3:05:47] <GustauveVIII> save up all your crests for chapter 13
[3:05:50] <uncle_speeps> the mouth guard and a few things that cost 50 that come up later are all the things worth getting
