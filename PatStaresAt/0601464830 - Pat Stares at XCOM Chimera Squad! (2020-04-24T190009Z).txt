[0:02:15] <cochramd1992> so this is the game with the snake-aliens that appeal to degenerates, huh
[0:02:16] <+DesertPenguin> If this is anything like the LP it's gonna be good

[0:03:52] <$frogj312> Was just watching old fisticuffs and then got a pop up pat was streaming haha
[0:03:52] <%Daskolin> @lotharrio Well probably because optimization is sh*t. Its lags on mega PC`s. But game controls literally made for console. Its hard to play on keyboard and mouse
[0:03:55] <%devil_may_cum_> “You miss 100% of the shots you take” -some guy
[0:04:12] <%pipboy344> Why is this not on console?
[0:04:18] <MyBulletsLAG> snek ladies when

[0:05:27] <%Daskolin> @lotharrio The game is good tho. Turn based initiative(dnd style) make it hard on iron man hardcore. Like more hard than Long war mode for Xcom:EW
[0:05:30] <%pipboy344> ENEMY UNKNOWN WAS ON FUCKING VITA AND IOS

[0:06:53] <%lotharrio> There was almost an 8 month gap between X2's PC and console releases.
[0:06:54] <%CursedNobleman> SNEK. SNEEEEEEK
[0:06:56] <ThatGuyThere03> not that it wasn't obvious given the premise of this game
[0:06:57] <bakkatohri> I haven't played XCOM since the first modernized one came out. Is this any good?
[0:06:58] <+liflamor> sup y'all
[0:07:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> So I've heard that the hot snake lady in this game is actually kind of racist. She doesn't like aliens...
[0:07:04] <MyBulletsLAG> I want angry snek ladies not understanding why they're missing point blank shots
[0:07:04] <ThatGuyThere03> XCOM 2 is great
[0:07:05] <%deviljhojho_> its good
[0:07:05] <+Remery_> @deathscythe122887 but how many Sneks tho
[0:07:07] <+queaks> "I had no idea people were into these sexy snakes I'm drawing
[0:07:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Huh huh
[0:07:18] <$QueequegTheater> And Xcom 2 runs like FUCKING TRASH on PS4 anyway
[0:07:22] <%Daskolin> @pipboy344 because its greatly optimized. This game is literally made for consoles(you can say by controls). But since its badly optimized, they didnt release it on consoles
[0:07:28] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> my XCOM team never died because the commander had Killer Queen: Bites the Dust (ie I am a filthy save scummer)
[0:07:31] <ThatGuyThere03> Yeah why would you ever not play XCOM on PC?
[0:07:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Can we have some Alien hate in this chat boys
[0:07:36] <%lotharrio> "It was by total accident that I gave them breasts and armor that emphasizes those breasts."
[0:07:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Use the X-word

[0:12:42] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt What do you know about this game going in?
[0:12:44] <$QueequegTheater> @patstaresat 60% of the way in, you shouldn't have any rookies at all
[0:12:45] <Veluren> Yo Pat did you see flying just got announced for ARR zones in 5.3?
[0:12:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Kreygasm500 I for real need a Snake Waifu in my Lonely Laifu... Warm scalie cuddles while we play animal crossing together sounds divine.... Why the hell am I such a touch starved lonely degenerate loser? Oh wait, I may know that already, nvm.... *BABY KITTEN UPDATE*: She has gotten curious and started eating the other cat's hard food, took to it pretty quick. Artemis has given a few wary sniffs of Flora without hissing or running, probably safe to say they will get along just fine as time goes
[0:12:54] <%croxeye> nah play till you can't win then restart with that knowledge, think of it as a longform rogulite with your knowledge being upgraded each run
[0:12:54] <%manwithboxonhead> If that happened, you would have to commit seppku.
[0:12:55] <$correctedsun117> There's a Best Friends voicepack mod

[0:13:11] <%sleepy_coffee> Hell yeh
[0:13:12] <%masterpiecejeremy> @PatStaresAt Ironman or GTFO
[0:13:12] <%marvel877> is the stream effing up for anyone else?
[0:13:13] <%lotharrio> Yeah sure I guess. As long as you are Ironman on stream.
[0:13:14] <BluBox> XCOM sometimes sounds like a good idea
[0:13:16] <%j0ustar> But people will pay money to be named. FREE $$$
[0:13:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> how much money to get you to name troopers after people in chat, Pat?
[0:13:17] <%StaceMcGate> This game has made me aware there is alot more scalies than I previously thought there were
[0:13:18] <bakkatohri> How can people like snakes when they have no ass? I'd only like snakes if they have asses....
[0:13:20] <%lotharrio> Or honestman at least.
[0:13:21] <%evbites> fair but don't show us if ya fuck up we can't go through that again

[0:13:30] <+scrumbotime> Stream none of it, tell no one, and just show us your team when you win the big game

[0:14:12] <%bluefooddye1> gib snek milkies
[0:14:14] <%lotharrio> 10 bucks is a solid counter argument.
[0:14:14] <+TheBigO75> Its ten bucks man
[0:14:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> do you think vipers eat their shed skin like geckos do?
[0:14:19] <%QuadraticGravity> 10 bucks, experimental side game with new mechanics

It is good to see you again. In the days since your capture I have done all I can to aid the UWU resistance from the inside. It was these Patie operatives that provided the feet pics leading to your recent extraction. Now, Patie forces are currently somewhat, disorganized. If we are to defeat BOOMER and their Monster Energy Masters

[0:43:44] <socratetris> Does Chimera look more cartoony than xcom2? just me?
[0:43:45] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> The original is as long as the first remake anyhow
[0:43:45] <%Typhaeon> That's not what a meme is
[0:43:47] <nepwar> that sucks. i have no motivation to go play the original. was hoping remake could do it
[0:43:48] <%optimasmaximas> the april fools joke?
[0:43:50] <%dekkitout> April Fools, Pat

[0:48:47] <%StaceMcGate> Sneks are wearing your down Pat
[0:48:48] <cureneckbeard> Woolie argued that a snek is specifically a snakegirl
[0:48:48] <+TheSaintJohn> warm drink = sleep
[0:48:49] <+Solutha> Reggie refuses snek
[0:48:49] <+akira_chong> Woolie's defenition of WAIT ARE YOU SERIOUS @PlagueOfGripes ?
[0:48:49] <%PanicSwytch> Kermit

[0:48:56] <%patriotrenegade> lol
[0:48:56] <%dekkitout> Isnt a non-sexy snek just a gorgon
[0:48:57] <%TallYoda08> @PatStaresAt I feel like you're one bad joke away from banning all of us. LUL
[0:48:57] <TwinBat> Yes
[0:48:59] <+Remery_> @Kamennoo shame :(
[0:48:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> FF8 actually already had the time travel plot
[0:48:59] <xxmagonx> VoteNay
[0:48:59] <@SSaryn> Nothing is better saved for FF8
[0:49:00] <derap41> Coffee doesn't "wake you up" it keeps you wokken uo
[0:49:00] <%j0ustar> WHAT
[0:49:01] <jbrowning134> coffee making you tired is a symptom of ADHD
[0:49:01] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[0:49:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:49:03] <%Sir_stride> factd
[0:49:04] <%patriotrenegade> Naw
[0:49:04] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Reggie refuses snek because he is coward man
[0:49:04] <Mighty_observer> the dirty weebs are making you tired pat
[0:49:04] <Jetsfantasy> Time compression is more confusing than FF7R
[0:49:05] <%CursedNobleman> YEEAAAAAH
[0:49:06] <%Conyst> how much sugar in coffee?
[0:49:07] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah but
[0:49:07] <+gimmickypizza> Boooo
[0:49:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh hi Plague! Pat is going insane from chat's neverending thirst for snek
[0:49:08] <yourliteraldog> Tali too
[0:49:08] <%BoomerUnchained> They suck, that's why
[0:49:09] <%Typhaeon> FF8 Demake when
[0:49:09] <brachydios777> What?
[0:49:09] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt I get that too. Near as I can tell, it's a reaction where your body produces extra insulin to deal with the coffee, causing you to crash
[0:49:10] <+akira_chong> SNEK IS JUST A CUTESY WAY OF SAYING SNAKE
[0:49:10] <ThatGuyThere03> who cares about FF8
[0:49:11] <cochramd1992> because they're not degenerates
[0:49:11] <%Aeoneth> Snek Lady
[0:49:11] <+jiggy_snipe> time compression tho
[0:49:11] <@SoFarFetched> totally wasn't an accident.
[0:49:12] <MaritimeSpanker> NOT A GIRL
[0:49:13] <%thenumber5point5> Plague he is denying Sneks help
[0:49:16] <%SWFanatic> Hes not a monster
[0:49:16] <$QueequegTheater> BIRD BOI
[0:49:16] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Skip 8 go to 9
[0:49:17] <%sleepy_coffee> The coffee has taken effect
[0:49:19] <+TheBigO75> Garrus does count tho
[0:49:21] <+Remery_> Cowards
[0:49:21] <$NarcissisticBrit> NarcissisticBrit subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:49:24] <nepwar> Sundowning?
[0:49:24] <%delilah4you> wow
[0:49:24] <caja_de_ojos> plague!
[0:49:24] <%devanmuse> i mean, ff8 is literally about time travel
[0:49:26] <+gimmickypizza> No one cares about ff8
[0:49:26] <%Conyst> GARRUS HOT
[0:49:26] <cureneckbeard> IIRC, Pat says snek is a general term for snakes, but Woolie thought it was a specific term for snakegirls, because that's how you see it used
[0:49:27] <%Country_Girl__> 🐍
[0:49:27] <%lotharrio> Woolie's also trying to ride snek into Dokapon popularity, framing it as an anti-Reggie movement.
[0:49:29] <%patriotrenegade> Garrus barely counts
[0:49:30] <$QueequegTheater> SNEEEEKKKK
[0:49:30] <%delilah4you> That might be the worst line read I've ever heard
[0:49:31] <ninjaguiden> PSA That Miaa cosplayed as Snake
[0:49:33] <%YakumoYomi> It pleases me to see Monogatari series references in here.
[0:49:34] <+Remery_> Garrus is a reptile alien tho
[0:49:34] <@SSaryn> Funny enough I sometimes drink coffee to sleep
[0:49:35] <%Binary_Fireball> XCOM was actually developed by Otacon it all makes sense now
[0:49:35] <fairore> @king_wolf_rigger okay then I'll give it a shot
[0:49:35] <cureneckbeard> snackeeee
[0:49:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> XCOM dev says they didn't know snake waifus existed and I don't believe them
[0:49:38] <%kyh9> I CARE ABOUT FF8
[0:49:39] <%PanicSwytch> Tali true waifu
[0:49:39] <%WhereIsWill> but keeping it real can go wrong pat!
[0:49:40] <+DinnerCalzone> Alien boys are adjacent to monster girls
[0:49:42] <%Aeoneth> Too Real, too real
[0:49:42] <%shurtal> Is that why it ALWAYS goes wrong?
[0:49:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> Garrus is hot.
[0:49:45] <%narusao> TOO real
[0:49:47] <%Daskolin> Lets be ral guys. Garus made us all Bisexual
[0:49:48] <RayCSmooth> Because it was "Hot Coffee"
[0:49:49] <+PlagueOfGripes> I'm not involved in this fictional story
[0:49:49] <derap41> When Keeping it real goes wrong
[0:49:51] <%Dr_DangerPhD> The Shape of Water is prob the most mainstream example
[0:49:51] <+FlareTitan> Garrus' race and Krogans are the only good Mass Effect alien races Change my mind
[0:49:52] <%nofestu2> 2 real 4 strem
[0:49:54] <cureneckbeard> aeiou
[0:49:54] <Mighty_observer> pat is hip hop
[0:49:55] <%Robot_Nixon_> @PatStaresAt getting tired from coffee is sometimes slight dehydration. Water might help
[0:49:56] <+Suplexsenpai> He’s gotta
[0:49:57] <@SSaryn> Your dabs are too real sometimes
[0:49:58] <%dancinginfernal> always be real
[0:49:59] <dero45> when keeping it real goes wrong
[0:50:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Keep it like 5% fake
[0:50:01] <%dekkitout> Right...
[0:50:02] <%Piemono> And then you dropped a hard R
[0:50:02] <$QueequegTheater> Thane > Garrus
[0:50:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Daskolin that is not inaccurate.
[0:50:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat can't stop keeping it real
[0:50:06] <%patriotrenegade> Someone has to
[0:50:07] <%iosephe> @FlareTitan Elcor
[0:50:07] <cureneckbeard> paige is the one keeping it too fake
[0:50:07] <+jiggy_snipe> has he never seen that Chappelle Show skit?
[0:50:09] <%GohanHitsugaya> Garrus is so cute
[0:50:15] <ThatGuyThere03> like the Chappelle's show sketch?

[0:50:43] <%Dakuu75> Coulda been worse

[1:06:46] <%de1ete_forever> there's no time for empathy, only xenophobia
[1:06:47] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Perhaps the game is cheap because it's a spinoff and in order to attract people who aren't already fans of the series

[1:10:02] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt It seems it was a controller issue dude from what other people are saying
[1:10:03] <%Cavumentum> I think it's just bad controller controls when it's meant for M+KB

[1:10:16] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It's not the game's fault you're playing with a controller
[1:10:19] <%ScottishMadJacko> Have i missed much, is the game good?
[1:10:20] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat the game says your controls in the bottom left corner of the screen. They change with context
[1:10:25] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> Tis but a scratch
[1:10:26] <%nofestu2> stream over
[1:10:33] <%SilverDevilfish> Gremlin
[1:10:39] <%Alopekis> @ScottishMadJacko You didn't miss much. He just started a little while ago.
[1:10:40] <%PanicSwytch> PermaDeath is removed in this game?
[1:10:45] <%iosephe> ???
[1:10:50] <WMGreywind> Infinite Gremlin healing is nice.
[1:10:56] <%Laecerelius> A character dying in a mission is a game over in this one
[1:10:57] <+caffienatedjedi> @PanicSwytch You lose the mission if an operative dies, since they are all named special characters
[1:10:59] <%MonsterEnvy> The game has controls in the corner including how to change targets
[1:11:05] <+PlagueOfGripes> I like being able to melee whenever you want
[1:11:08] <@SSaryn> @panicswytch Not exactly, if any person dies/bleeds out, its game over
[1:11:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @panicswytch Yup. Game Over / Restart Mission if dead

[1:11:40] <Redblood801> Hw wasn't very STUPORED
[1:11:41] <+Link232> Lost one action, can still fire with the one action
[1:11:41] <%QuadraticGravity> Reading abilities is hard
[1:11:42] <%ArcanumMBD> Stupor 1 takes away 1 action from their turn
[1:11:42] <%spiritofmojave> Gib mind psaGib
[1:11:46] <%Run44forrest> oooooh
[1:11:49] <%ArcanumMBD> Stupor 2 would full stun them
[1:11:49] <%Daskolin> Numbers are DND initiatibve
[1:11:50] <+Link232> Everyone gets 2 actions, stupor removes either 1 or 2 actions, so half stun or full stun
[1:11:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> sectoids have an entire mechanic about building BRAIN networks
[1:11:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat is stupor
[1:11:51] <honeyman18> Now shoot him so the alien feels him die
[1:11:52] <DomunDomunDomun> It's stun for 1-2 actions, not turns.
[1:11:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT TAKES 1 OR 2 ACTIONS
[1:11:57] <WMGreywind> 3 for 3.
[1:12:04] <%Alopekis> Jesus
[1:12:04] <Heyestus> It looks like stupor removes 1 of the 2 actions characters get to take each turn @PatStaresAt
[1:12:05] <+Walopoh> gotdamn

[1:13:05] <%Alopekis> Long War is fine
[1:13:05] <+atin2000> @PatStaresAt only play long war if you hate yourself
[1:13:06] <austinj24> Yes
[1:13:06] <DoostCola> XCOM 2 long war is ass
[1:13:06] <%FakeWaifu> WOTC
[1:13:07] <%JuliusGemstone> yes
[1:13:07] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> DEW IT
[1:13:07] <%ArcanumMBD> Long War would kill you Pat
[1:13:08] <%SilverDevilfish> 6 months later Pat finally has a successful run of long war
[1:13:08] <%InfamousShephard> Long is great, you shouldnt play it
[1:13:08] <dfs_k> it's VERY LONG
[1:13:08] <%barrakuta371> Yes if you're a masochist
[1:13:08] <%aishman> It's only good if you know the system inside and out. Like it's for the HARDCORE OF THE HARDCORE @PatStaresAt
[1:13:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[1:13:08] <%sleepy_coffee> Oh god two x cops just buttstroked that poor criminal
[1:13:09] <%lotharrio> @PatStaresAt If you can't beat XCOM2, then you shouldn't look at Long War.
[1:13:09] <%spiritofmojave> It's long for a reason
[1:13:09] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> Long War for XCOM 2 is still largely in beta isn't it?
[1:13:10] <ninjaguiden> Play Darkest Dungeon Radiant
[1:13:11] <UncannyMatt> COWARDS say no
[1:13:12] <derap41> Long war is LOOOOOONG
[1:13:12] <%JuliusGemstone> yes you fools
[1:13:13] <+michingmallecho> It’s pretty long
[1:13:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> they're telling YOU not to play it. Long War is good, however
[1:13:15] <+Zyquux> Long War is good, but DON'T PLAY IT
[1:13:16] <%Laecerelius> Long War would kill you via mind goblinitis
[1:13:19] <somekindofsam> Play with DLC
[1:13:20] <%Cavumentum> You might as well play PHOENIX POINT when you do that
[1:13:22] <%de1ete_forever> long wars are against the art of war, so no
[1:13:22] <honeyman18> it's split, unlike your snake gf's legs
[1:13:23] <@SSaryn> Because that's the biggest problem with Long War. Its fucking long.
[1:13:25] <%kyh9> Long War would make your OCD fucking EXPLODE
[1:13:26] <%MasterTonberry23> Long War would take too long
[1:13:27] <+polypolipauli> It's great! don't play it though
[1:13:28] <+dongstomper69> PLAY OPERATORS VS ALIENS mjbEags
[1:13:28] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> You're better off just playing XCOM 2 with WotC installed.
[1:13:29] <%Daskolin> XCOM 1 LONG WAR is GREAT. XCOM2 WAR of CHOSEN IS BETTER
[1:13:36] <%CursedNobleman> long war isnt stream friendly. hell, most xcoms aside from chimera squad arent stream friendly
[1:13:37] <+caffienatedjedi> FUZE the hostage
[1:13:40] <%maenos2> that...seems close
[1:13:42] <%CuttleCrow> psaHoldon
[1:13:43] <%maenos2> to the breaching charge
[1:13:49] <+Zyquux> He's XCOM: Siege so far?
[1:13:49] <%aishman> It's only good if you know the system inside and out. Like it's for the HARDCORE OF THE HARDCORE @PatStaresAt Also mind goblins would make you hate it.
[1:13:50] <%Shackle_Rustyford> Long War is great but, your mind goblins will literally kill you
[1:13:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> he's in his pouty so mad stance
[1:13:54] <+griffball13> PURGE THE XEONS
[1:13:55] <%evbites> ahh the fuse approach
[1:13:57] <derap41> Anyone actually think Pat could handle Long war like that shit is hard
[1:14:00] <+McAngrimStein> yes, antagonize the hostage taker
[1:14:02] <%Laecerelius> Pouty terror boi

[1:14:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE RACE WAR STARTS NOOOOOOW!
[1:14:32] <%Valdorick> That man had a family
[1:14:35] <%lotharrio> @PatStaresAt Long War is good, but difficult. If you couldn't finish XCOM2, then Long War will just be painful.

[1:22:33] <ManfredA> what percentage of the population do you think are viper-human hybrids?
[1:22:39] <$Zathas> Give me snake poon, or give me DEATH.
[1:22:40] <ManfredA> asking for a friend
[1:22:40] <$Zalthia> They aren't friends thats why we're here
[1:22:40] <WhatzePh> So it's basically XCOM: Apocalypse, but good?
[1:22:42] <%Alopekis> 12%
[1:22:43] <%Picia000123> Those gaddamn aliens stealing our jobs FreakinStinkin
[1:22:45] <%QuadraticGravity> You only have these four right now
[1:22:45] <DaCheekyOne> Damn, talk is hard
[1:22:47] <cochramd1992> @gespenst25 plot twist, the aliens won, this is all a brainwashed illusion
[1:22:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can't do missions without people in the APC
[1:22:48] <+atin2000> I am an alien racist, and im proud of it!
[1:22:49] <nukle0nik> oh god pat
[1:22:54] <%Ronaxsis> the food ads the play on the radio between missions are the best
[1:22:55] <Redblood801> @ManfredA Not enough unfortunately
[1:22:55] <derap41> @ManfredA Pretty sure all Thinmen are dead or changed
[1:22:56] <%QuadraticGravity> Pat you ONLY have these four
[1:22:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> go recruit more people
[1:22:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ManfredA Not enough of the population, I'll tell you that right now.
[1:23:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gespenst25 Because everyone except the Ethereals were LITERAL MINDSLAVES
[1:23:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Humans go home
[1:23:03] <%schlager087> Commander, we got our shit pushed in that i'm now dating a snake person
[1:23:03] <%lotharrio> Pat's drunk as we speak.
[1:23:03] <%za7az> @gespenst25 Because the aliens were only evil because they were being mind controlled
[1:23:06] <honeyman18> MORE SNEKS
[1:23:07] <%MasterTonberry23> Everyones friends because the Elders were using mind control to keep their army in line. With them gone most of ADVENT had nothing against humanity it turns out
[1:23:11] <%QuadraticGravity> BY DOING THE MISSION
[1:23:12] <+Exicuren> Speciesism
[1:23:13] <@SoFarFetched> "How to snek"
[1:23:13] <nukle0nik> you can't
[1:23:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> back out. menu
[1:23:14] <mdkcde> Mass Effecting it huh?
[1:23:14] <%aishman> You don't
[1:23:16] <Mister_McDerp> have to play without tutorial to use everyone
[1:23:17] <Torgue_1> By doing the tutorial
[1:23:18] <Mighty_observer> i hate all offworlders, INCLUDING ZEON!
[1:23:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU HAVE 4
[1:23:18] <%hahaha1171> you wait
[1:23:19] <MaritimeSpanker> you know, is it really that weird if you think that if I saw my dad being ripped apart by Sectoids and Mutons, that I really wouldn't feel comfortable with just letting them be around?
[1:23:22] <%Garthunox> god this is gonna be awful ain't it
[1:23:23] <%spiritofmojave> Humans, on MY earth? Gross.
[1:23:23] <Heyestus> How in the fuck were there No killings of the nonhumans enforcing a fascist worldwide regime?
[1:23:24] <%herecomesmong0> Recruit more pimps, more pushers
[1:23:24] <%ghostofsolomon> i dont think you can recruit
[1:23:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GeneralSCPatton Except the horrible murder bugs. They were always horrible murder bugs.
[1:23:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> wants you to tutorial first
[1:23:31] <%gespenst25> I guess that's what I get for not being able to beat the game LUL
[1:23:31] <%CuttleCrow> THERE'S NO TIME
[1:23:32] <%Cavumentum> ADVENT are the TAU.
[1:23:40] <nukle0nik> the firaxis guy who sent pat the key prob feeling really good right now
[1:23:40] <WhatzePh> Is Patrick broken?
[1:23:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wolf_rigger Fuck those things
[1:23:44] <dementedcactus> Do it
[1:23:51] <yourliteraldog> This is actually a cool change of pace from insurgents to a "peace" time counter insurgents
[1:23:52] <%DappercatEsquire> Lucky that all these alien cultures didn't harbor inherent xenophobic feelings, and it was all just forced on them with mind control
[1:23:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> blue is automatic missions
[1:23:53] <%Garthunox> brain
[1:23:54] <KaliasTV> Is pat alright
[1:23:54] <derap41> @MasterTonberry23 They were also gene edited to be more susceptible and aggresive its nice that you get to see "natrual" alien species
[1:23:54] <+Solutha> Pat the sun isnt down yet
[1:23:54] <%MasterTonberry23> @MaritimeSpanker Guess you wouldnt have been cool with making peace with Germany after WW2 LUL
[1:23:56] <kd0g_> I imagine this will be like playing Mass Effect where you avoid ever using the human characters
[1:23:58] <+scrumbotime> "sending it to the here"
[1:24:00] <Mister_McDerp> SNEK WHEN?
[1:24:02] <%lotharrio> Pat the sun is UP you have no excuse.

[1:24:26] <derap41> I think Ayylex Jones did it
[1:24:30] <%Dakuu75> you have 3 factions in your city with KNOWN ACESS TO BOMBS... wtf was this mayor and police force doing?
[1:24:32] <%optimasmaximas> sacred alien guys
[1:24:32] <%SGrim> The conveniently racial segregated gains for ease of hatred. psaBig psaWrong
[1:24:34] <%Run44forrest> psions PogChamp
[1:24:34] <%Valdorick> GENESTEALER CULTS!?
[1:24:35] <%Zombrocom> I mean, to be fair, people were living along side alien dudes for years under the Elder control. it's just Xcom and resistance who got shot
[1:24:37] <%lotharrio> So Magneto, Alien Mafia and dudes who want to be slaves again.
[1:24:37] <%ArcanumMBD> Sacred Coil
[1:24:38] <UncannyMatt> SAC
[1:24:38] <+Zyquux> Kill all aliens #HumanityFirst

[1:24:52] <derap41> Snek coil
[1:24:52] <%de1ete_forever> but weawpons tho
[1:24:53] <%Bailey__gaming> Grey Phoenix is a cool ass name
[1:24:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> I chose Sacred Coil because they seemed the craziest
[1:24:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fuck the Cryssalids.
[1:24:59] <%Garthunox> did you?
[1:25:00] <%Gogogolem> So this effects nothing other then who you fight end game.
[1:25:00] <+Zyquux> Chrysalids monkaW
[1:25:01] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> So the first ones seem like the Templars but even more zealot.
[1:25:01] <+TheDankDemon> race religion

[1:25:02] <ardbart> Zealous Static

[1:25:05] <OperatorPlease> go get progeny my man's
[1:25:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GeneralSCPatton I had a character is the first game that somehow survived two attacks from them, then promptly shotgunned her way to freedom. After that mission she earned the random callsign "Psycho". She was a beast.
[1:25:08] <%optimasmaximas> pagues here PogChamp
[1:25:08] <%spiritofmojave> Zealots are spooky
[1:25:11] <%mige_> bugge
[1:25:15] <JeoDood> Fight the religious
[1:25:15] <%herecomesmong0> Is the progeny templar remnants from war of the chosen?
[1:25:17] <%Garthunox> did you fight them?
[1:25:18] <+atin2000> its clearly the XENOS
[1:25:19] <%king_wragles> Go with Phoenix again cause they have cool hats
[1:25:19] <+Exicuren> War against religion
[1:25:21] <Torgue_1> I think you fight all three
[1:25:21] <%MasterTonberry23> I'm guessing we'll be fighting all of them sooner or later
[1:25:21] <derap41> The coil is snek
[1:25:23] <+caffienatedjedi> Each of these make up the 3 chapters, you can tackle them in any order.
[1:25:27] <%Run44forrest> PogChamp

[1:25:34] <%Robot_Nixon_> BlessRNG
[1:25:35] <+photas10> is this a standalone game or expansion?
[1:25:37] <MaritimeSpanker> @MasterTonberry23 I mean, lotsa people who lost people in that war on both sides didn't really have good thinking on people on the other side for some time - hence the cold war stuff. 5 years is a VERY short time to just accept stuff like that
[1:25:38] <fairore> @herecomesmong0 that would be interesting
[1:25:40] <%Gogogolem> You fight them all, its just in which order.
[1:25:41] <%Garthunox> so I have created my religion to Sonic
[1:25:42] <%lotharrio> @photas10 Stand alone

[1:34:00] <%Valdorick> But do they have Robutts?
[1:34:02] <%lotharrio> @Ner234 Not that much more serious. There's pretty steady trains of jokes. Like your science officer in X2 is obsessed with the government made hamburgers, and pushes agents to get pictures of the menu.
[1:34:04] <Mighty_observer> i see xcom RNG is as godlike as ever
[1:34:10] <+photas10> why is this game getting bad reviews
[1:34:12] <PirateMike_> These are jihad androids
[1:34:12] <%Valdorick> Or Snek Robots ///
[1:34:15] <redrins> but when do agents fuck
[1:34:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Use this when agents fuck"?
[1:34:16] <%dukenux> is this that new XCom game

[1:34:32] <%YakumoYomi> @dukenux Yes indeed
[1:34:35] <%42nfl19> @photas10 People probably hate that it is not a "full" game.
[1:34:37] <dementedcactus> That RNG is still, xcom...
[1:34:45] <ThirdPersonPhil> arrest that robot
[1:34:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[1:34:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Ner234 Yeah. Since X-Com is military, the characters don't just crack jokes with poor timing in the middle of a serious mission, and act like professionals. This game is more like a Disney live action show, if you get my meaning.
[1:34:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> has some bugs. it's an inbetween release, so people are pouty
[1:34:53] <mondo8> I could go for some advent burgers
[1:34:55] <Gorgs7> it's once per mission
[1:34:57] <%DappercatEsquire> Is it still the true hit percent, or weighted like FE?
[1:34:59] <Gorgs7> just fyi
[1:34:59] <kevinwager> anyone know in stream what consle that SEGA all stars tnenies game was for

[1:35:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> MAYBE IF YOU READ DESCRIPTIONS
[1:35:53] <%MajorCrasher> READ DAMMIT
[1:35:58] <%kyh9> It takes one turn to blow up
[1:35:58] <%hahaha1171> shoot it
[1:36:08] <%Dakuu75> SEVERAL TURNS for a FUCKING grenade?! what trash
[1:36:11] <PirateMike_> LUL
[1:36:14] <$Mopopolis> ZOOM
[1:36:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @DappercatEsquire The hit percentage was unfortuantely never true in this series. It was always a 50/50 coinflip that was made in the loading screen pre-mission. Kinda why I started to loath the series.
[1:36:16] <%Zombrocom> Wasted turn
[1:36:16] <pede2011> lmao x2
[1:36:19] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> Pat is Milk-Chan confirmed

[1:36:32] <%barrakuta371> That's XCOM baby!
[1:36:32] <%Jekado> XCOMED
[1:36:33] <Mighty_observer> OH BOY
[1:36:34] <DoostCola> pro player pat
[1:36:34] <%lotharrio> @Dakuu75 It would have gone the next turn in the order, but Pat spent an action blowing it up early.
[1:36:36] <%Esparsenior> Pat has the dumb brain on today
[1:36:37] <+caffienatedjedi> Grenade gets a spot in the turn tracker for when it detonates, or you manually det it. Its really good if you know how to play.
[1:36:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Sure is XCOM alright
[1:36:39] <+gutlesscoward> pat's crushing it so hard
[1:36:41] <leinadtonu> Pat firmly believes that reading is a skill for the poor.
[1:36:41] <nepwar> KINETIC CARDS
[1:36:42] <%viewtifulr> what a dud
[1:36:43] <%Esparsenior> As well as the blind eyes
[1:36:44] <%DappercatEsquire> @King_Wolf_Rigger Wait, really? Anywhere I can read about that?
[1:36:50] <+skip_dippety> what, aiming angles?
[1:36:52] <%lutefiiisk> GET THE GUN! GOTTA GET THE GUN!
[1:36:57] <@SoFarFetched> NOW PAT HAS TO UNCHEAT
[1:36:58] <%spiritofmojave> IT SURE IS

[1:37:03] <nox_nyctores> Suuuuure Kapp
[1:37:03] <Mighty_observer> @barrakuta371 get out of here Zoran
[1:37:04] <%viewtifulr> there it is
[1:37:04] <Covil91> It's bullshit. Percentages favour you if anything.
[1:37:04] <%hahaha1171> boo
[1:37:06] <%SummonerMagno> he says now
[1:37:08] <%viewtifulr> ol xcom
[1:37:10] <+CarlosEoM> easy mode again huh
[1:37:12] <PirateMike_> Anyone remember that clip of pat liam and woolie trying to get a xcom soldier lady to shoot some alien point blank and she missed?
[1:37:12] <%ArcanumMBD> ALL THESE COWARDS SAYING FULL HEAL
[1:37:13] <%hahaha1171> ye
[1:37:16] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @King_Wolf_Rigger where did you hear that?
[1:37:16] <robobro333> not a fan of the portraits
[1:37:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah you wouldn't want to be TOO skilled
[1:37:20] <%Gogogolem> the difficulty ramps real fast.
[1:37:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> MEC PARTS!? FUCK YES
[1:37:22] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> So those androids are just new versions of ADVENT MECs.
[1:37:22] <%lotharrio> @ArcanumMBD Pat's going to need it.
[1:37:24] <%VHGS> @DappercatEsquire it's just seeded, so if you savescum and take the same actions you get the same rolls.
[1:37:25] <Mighty_observer> THATS XCOM BABY!
[1:37:25] <DomunDomunDomun> There's a change difficulty menu back in the base.
[1:37:26] <%Garthunox> pat the coward, playing on easy
[1:37:27] <+caffienatedjedi> @DappercatEsquire He is wrong. Its seeded but changing your actions on a reload changes the outcome.
[1:37:32] <%Typhaeon> half skill
[1:37:33] <rubbishbinge> Easy mode is built into you, Pat
[1:37:40] <+CarlosEoM> where the sneks at tho?
[1:37:45] <derap41> Wow Pat still using the A wor what is this the 1970s
[1:37:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @DappercatEsquire It was WAY back when the first game came out, and I remember someone like TotalBiscuit talking about how they didn't change it for the second one. It's been too long since I last heard.
[1:37:59] <%Garthunox> pat gives shit to woolie about selling out humanity but in reality he is the sellout
[1:38:10] <MaritimeSpanker> SUPRISE MOTHERFUCKA
[1:38:16] <Mighty_observer> robots can be surprised?
[1:38:19] <MSN04_Sazabi> Being seeded or not only matters if you aren't playing on Ironman like you should
[1:38:20] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt am i incorrect for thinking that this is just a Mass Effect game in the XCOM engine?
[1:38:27] <+akira_chong> @Ner234 The missions and the soldiers in the missions are a lot more serious in the other two XCOM reboot games, as is the game overall. There are jokes, sure, but they're nowhere near as central, and characters don't act so unprofessional.
[1:38:30] <OperatorPlease> wayyyy better this time
[1:38:31] <%Laecerelius> Die, HOOMAN!
[1:38:32] <%Cavumentum> NICE
[1:38:32] <$Mopopolis> Nice
[1:38:35] <%Dr_Mooose> nice
[1:38:37] <+caffienatedjedi> If you reload the game, and redo your actions exactly, they play out exactly the same. RNG is seeded. If you change your actions it changes the rolls. There are also mutators to randomize the seed on reload.
[1:38:37] <+CarlosEoM> this looks fun
[1:38:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @caffienatedjedi When you reload the game, it just makes the coin flips again. So while yeah, you can re-seed the flips, they are just 50/50.
[1:38:38] <RunningNGunning> nice
[1:38:38] <+toficque> 69
[1:38:46] <robobro333> wait can you not make your own dudes?

[1:38:51] <%Garthunox> @akira_chong boo hoo

[1:39:08] <%Binary_Fireball> what are you gonna do shoot me?
[1:39:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> all civvies are gross
[1:39:15] <%ArcanumMBD> The triangle over the head means he's gonna run away on his turn
[1:39:17] <+Suplexsenpai> 71 LUL
[1:39:23] <%corgispudmen> just shoot him
[1:39:24] <yourliteraldog> Lmao do you think mutons are fun to drink with?
[1:39:24] <OperatorPlease> YES
[1:39:25] <%Cavumentum> Just walk up and shoot the motherfucker
[1:39:25] <%reinbachthe3rd> @hahaha1171 Wait until Plague gets his hands on this game.
[1:39:26] <%hahaha1171> yes
[1:39:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> yes
[1:39:27] <$Mopopolis> Yes?
[1:39:28] <JeoDood> never shoot the snek
[1:39:29] <xxmagonx> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:39:30] <%Dragovus> Shoot the civies until they die
[1:39:31] <%spiritofmojave> ye
[1:39:31] <%Garthunox> yes
[1:39:32] <%GohanHitsugaya> He is, he is for real with you right now bro.
[1:39:32] <%lotharrio> It means they'll try to run instead of fight.
[1:39:36] <kulmoth> ahhhhhh
[1:39:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> enjoy
[1:39:40] <MSN04_Sazabi> Seriously, XCOM is like a gaming equivalent of a casino: turns out most people don't understand how odds work
[1:39:42] <$Mopopolis> D:
[1:39:43] <%jjjdanny> taking the lower percent LUL
[1:39:46] <+xerotwo> D:
[1:39:47] <Ralfclogs> Yes
[1:39:48] <%Laecerelius> amazing
[1:39:49] <+FrenchTact1cs> Omg
[1:39:52] <Mighty_observer> kill the innocent and burn their bodies
[1:39:56] <%dukenux> never tell me the odds
[1:40:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @MSN04_Sazabi 50% of the time the shot misses every time
[1:40:01] <%de1ete_forever> kill that Civvie 11
[1:40:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> you don't even need to do that
[1:40:03] <%AncelDeLambert> were there robots in XCOM 2? I don't remember at all
[1:40:05] <%bluefooddye1> getting flashbacks to the XCOM2 LP
[1:40:08] <robobro333> @MSN04_Sazabi yeah man 95% is pretty bad odds
[1:40:14] <+Exicuren> Ugly civvies rescued means positive votes at the polls
[1:40:16] <%Alopekis> There were robots in XCOM 2 @AncelDeLambert
[1:40:18] <PirateMike_> @AncelDeLambert yes
[1:40:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @msn04_sazabi BUT HOW AM NUMBORS IS WORK?
[1:40:19] <yourliteraldog> take the high ground anakin
[1:40:23] <%Zombrocom> Man, rescueing a muton feels so strange
[1:40:23] <robobro333> just like in xcom @MSN04_Sazabi
[1:40:29] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, cuz these guys look weird
[1:40:36] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> Overwatching still valid. Good.
[1:40:40] <MSN04_Sazabi> @robobro333 Do you remember all the 95% that hit as well as the ones that missed? Kappa
[1:40:42] <derap41> That's not pc Pat
[1:40:47] <scrublord009> USE TACKLE
[1:40:49] <+PlagueOfGripes> he runs like a weirdo
[1:40:50] <%hahaha1171> 10/10 plays only on angriest pat
[1:40:52] <PirateMike_> These are lame baby robots
[1:40:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MSN04_Sazabi That's a good mobile suit. And it doesn't help that X-com has a history of not actually rolling dice when you press the button but rather seeding hits and misses during loading screens.
[1:40:54] <%Bailey__gaming> give me sneaks goddamit game lol
[1:41:01] <+michingmallecho> Rising taku
[1:41:06] <Mighty_observer> @msn04_sazabi but xcom is cheaper
[1:41:07] <%dukenux> honestly the 95% crap when when at point blank should be removed tho. just add damage penalty if you get a bad roll instead or sonething
[1:41:08] <robobro333> @MSN04_Sazabi not if you play in ironman mode
[1:41:09] <%ArcanumMBD> @TheTunnelSn8ke overwatching feels way better now. You have to aim the cone but you don't take a massive aim penalty when you overwatch
[1:41:10] <%VHGS> @King_Wolf_Rigger that isn't what that means or how it works. You are an idiot.
[1:41:15] <faykeyfake> is it a good game so far, wheres the snakes?
[1:41:23] <scrublord009> THESE IMPROVEMENTS THO PogChamp
[1:41:24] <robobro333> @MSN04_Sazabi cant savescum your way out of that one
[1:41:25] <%Daxalog> Ovewrwatch was a mistake
[1:41:25] <%TheTunnelSn8ke> Hah, that one went kaboom
[1:41:25] <%Alopekis> The snakes are still to come
[1:41:31] <%dukenux> dont let them into my zoooone~
[1:41:34] <%Typhaeon> @hahaha1171 You silly, it's Pat Angers At now
[1:41:37] <derap41> Its a good game
[1:41:44] <%dukenux> So does he have aliens on his team?
[1:41:47] <+Pequod1> Xcom is swat now?
[1:41:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wolf_rigger It seeds percentile values that are compared with the odds.
[1:41:54] <%Alopekis> Yep @dukenux
[1:41:55] <+Zyquux> D:
[1:41:55] <%Run44forrest> D:
[1:41:57] <+michingmallecho> Yes...
[1:41:57] <%jjjdanny> seeding isn't bad and they aren't 50/50 always
[1:41:58] <+caffienatedjedi> I think Grey Phalanx(name?) has the most sneks. Not Sacred Coil.

[1:42:12] <%ArcanumMBD> @dukenux Cherub is a advent soldier hybrid, and Verge is one of the humanoid sectoids from x2
[1:42:14] <%DappercatEsquire> Man I just wanted to verify if XCOM will still take advantage of my lack of understanding w/r/t statistic.
[1:42:16] <scrublord009> So we did all that in xcom 2 so humanity could fuck aliens??????
[1:42:27] <%lotharrio> @scrublord009 Yes. And?
[1:42:31] <%UvBenServed> Totally worth it
[1:42:32] <%dukenux> Yeah ive seen Verge
[1:42:32] <+pooperscooper14> worth
[1:42:32] <%Alopekis> @scrublord009 What else did you think we were doing it for?
[1:42:35] <Redblood801> WORTH IT
[1:42:37] <%dukenux> he looks freshhh
[1:42:38] <%viewtifulr> have you seen the sneks plague drew?
[1:42:43] <scrublord009> @lotharrio I would've finished the game if I knew LUL
[1:42:46] <Mighty_observer> murder!
[1:42:47] <%Agami23> that sectoid reminds me of northornlion
[1:42:50] <MSN04_Sazabi> And by the way, 100% accuracy is totally within your reach, just not with rookies with no items

[1:42:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> welp
[1:42:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GeneralSCPatton Yeah, but it really doesn't factor in the actual values. It just chooses a yes or no for hits mostly randomly.
[1:42:59] <PirateMike_> Braaap Braap
[1:43:03] <+Solutha> Good shotgun

[1:43:13] <%Cervarian> Getting the feeling this is a testing ground of sorts as they work on XCOM 3.
[1:43:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wolf_rigger YOU ARE INFINITELY WRONG
[1:43:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> Verge and Cherub are like if Wrex and Garrus were gigantic human infants that have just bitten off their own umbilical cords and are racing for the exit
[1:43:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> @King_Wolf_Rigger You gonna keep talking out of your ass or you're gonna show where you got that from?
[1:43:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Rekt
[1:43:39] <+caffienatedjedi> @King_Wolf_Rigger There are mods that explicitly give you the numbers factoring into how it works. It is not 50/50
[1:43:40] <$Mopopolis> BONK

[1:43:44] <%QuadraticGravity> TURN ORDER LUL

[1:43:51] <%ArcanumMBD> This is why you look at turn order
[1:43:55] <%lotharrio> Pat, it's like FF10, you gotta pay attention to that turn order.
[1:43:56] <%bluefooddye1> Big brain moves

[1:43:59] <+Solutha> thats why u just kill

[1:44:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can indeed interrogate the robots. somehow.
[1:44:02] <rubbishbinge> arrestn't
[1:44:08] <+CarlosEoM> they outta here
[1:44:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GeneralSCPatton How does it figure your hit percentage during loading screen when you can change those by positioning?
[1:44:11] <%de1ete_forever> speaking of SWAT games, "Ready Or Not" is doing a gameplay reveal in 2 hours
[1:44:13] <+caffienatedjedi> You just open up their robot harddrives.
[1:44:15] <+Link232> I imagine the robot interrogation is less actual interrogation and just kinda hacking them

[1:45:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wolf_rigger YOU DENSE MOTHERFUCKER. LEARN ABOUT MONTE CARLO PROCESSES. It generates decimal numbers. If it gens a 78.01, then a 75% shot will miss and an 80% will hit.
[1:45:46] <%Run44forrest> wow
[1:45:46] <%dukenux> no :)

[1:46:19] <rubbishbinge> I can't believe pat got a mail order snek waifu
[1:46:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, people are pissed that I'm saying that X-com doesn't roll the chance when you shoot, but picks shit randomly during loading screens.
[1:46:24] <+MidnightBurst12> I can't believe pat would just abandon us
[1:46:26] <+OhioNitsud> Don't let em in!
[1:46:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> chat, you are under arrest for harboring androids. do not attempt to self destruct
[1:46:31] <Mighty_observer> pat is having the cocaine delivered right to his door

[1:46:39] <xxmagonx> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[1:46:45] <%jjjdanny> It also isn't a coin flip like your claim

[1:46:55] <%DappercatEsquire> @caffienatedjedi Cool, no real issue with you just being 'ambiguous force of agency' like other squad based games, either way.
[1:46:59] <%hzealot> @PlagueOfGripes you cant take away my android on insectoid fan art
[1:47:02] <%Typhaeon> Harboring androids? wouldn't they just short out in the water?
[1:47:06] <%Fenrirlives> How many Vipers are in the game as playable units?
[1:47:09] <+caffienatedjedi> mjbHYPERNYA mjbRANGER mjbAyy
[1:47:09] <%s_xylocalsingles> oh jeez are we gonna go into submode? psaBlind
[1:47:11] <HimakiLuvsU> I like the handcuffs @plagueofgripes
[1:47:17] <%HouseofNonsense> I'll harbor androids all day, er day. Fucking pigs can't stop me.
[1:47:17] <%Garthunox> @generalscpatton haha monte carlo processes are made up
[1:47:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> I've only seen Torque so far
[1:47:27] <%Run44forrest> revOlver MrDestructoid f u c k y o u p i g
[1:47:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> There's quite a few units though
[1:47:36] <PirateMike_> I can't wait for fuckable androids
[1:47:37] <WMGreywind> Torque is great. Axiom is already pretty nice.
[1:47:40] <+12bfaught> @King_Wolf_Rigger The point is to keep you from savescumming individual rolls
[1:47:44] <%Jp3g95> @HouseofNonsense why are you fucking pigs? ruuThink
[1:47:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> Torque hates most people
[1:47:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @jjjdanny Alright, I'll concede it's not a direct coin flip, but the values are a straight up lie. It chooses in the background, and you don't know if your 75% is good enough for that.
[1:47:58] <%richmon_> a month til Xenoblade DE!
[1:48:00] <%Fenrirlives> @plagueofgripes nice! here's hoping there's a nice variety of all the aliens
[1:48:02] <yourliteraldog> I'm a soveriegn citizen I can have all the andriods, weed and gay plasma rifles I want
[1:48:04] <%QuadraticGravity> @King_Wolf_Rigger Because that's literally not how the mechanic works.
[1:48:09] <gekizenbu> Torque is literally Spacist
[1:48:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @12bfaught But if I want to, what's wrong with that?
[1:48:13] <%emperordread> @PirateMike_ Fuckable androids exist, they cost around $8k US
[1:48:14] <%Garthunox> @run44forrest why dont you fuck me yourself
[1:48:16] <+caffienatedjedi> mjbNya mjbRANGER MrDestructoid
[1:48:17] <%jjjdanny> procgen relies on seeding and is therefore not really random -- People who complain about xcom rolls if they want to be consistent
[1:48:18] <%HouseofNonsense> @Jp3g95 ...I plead the fifth? LUL
[1:48:20] <%Laecerelius> @PlagueOfGripes So she's perfect for you!
[1:48:27] <MSN04_Sazabi> "I want to savescum" LUL
[1:48:29] <+Remery_> He wants Android 16?
[1:48:29] <+12bfaught> @King_Wolf_Rigger b/c it's literally cheating
[1:48:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> she also has really badly bugged animations
[1:48:39] <+michingmallecho> michingmallecho subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Snek boobs or alien genocide HahaBall
[1:48:49] <+12bfaught> @King_Wolf_Rigger you're complaining about a game making it harder to cheese it
[1:48:50] <+caffienatedjedi> If you want to savescum, you just have to play out your turns differently, or use the seed randomizer mutation.
[1:48:52] <$Mopopolis> SNEK TIDDY
[1:48:52] <HimakiLuvsU> soggyWow soggyWow soggyWow
[1:48:54] <yourliteraldog> You cheated not only the game but yourself
[1:48:55] <PirateMike_> @emperordread yeee they don't look like them Quantom dreams robots
[1:48:58] <Mighty_observer> @msn04_sazabi you can't save scum Amuro
[1:49:03] <daisyyyy> if the dice roll happens when you take the shot or ten minutes before its still a dice roll
[1:49:04] <%HouseofNonsense> BTW, I was told this game has punch girls of some kind?
[1:49:09] <MSN04_Sazabi> BTW, they're also actual savescumming features, you can enable seed recalculation on each reload
[1:49:09] <%Garthunox> guys stop arguing about numbers, you sound silly
[1:49:10] <HimakiLuvsU> WE MUST SECURE THR BIOHAZARD CONTAINER

[1:51:49] <$Mopopolis> Yay!
[1:51:52] <MSN04_Sazabi> The thing people need to understand is that having three 85% shots doesn't mean you're gonna hit at least 2 of those, or at least 8 out of 10. You're gonna hit 850 shots out of 1000. And in those 1000 shots you might just miss 4 in a row.
[1:51:53] <%Garthunox> @generalscpatton so fuckin what? how does that affect you?

[1:52:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShawnTK_ My problem is that it rolls behind the scenes, and you can't really know if the value it shows you is real. As someone who plays a lot of D&D and Rifts, I'm okay with rolls going bad, but I want to see them work in front of me.

[2:05:43] <CriticKitten> @Onatamana I mean she basically talks about how we need to ship away the "off-worlders" so
[2:05:43] <%DappercatEsquire> Man this is a real speed run of the XCOM 2 LP
[2:05:44] <HimakiLuvsU> OPFOR LAST OPERATOR STANDING

[2:05:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> and 99% is 0%, of course
[2:05:55] <%de1ete_forever> may the odds forever be in your favour
[2:05:55] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So are you playing as the Aliens in this game or did shit happen in the last game to where now aliens have joined the resistance?

[2:09:19] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I have not seen someone lose this game in this way. How novel
[2:09:19] <%Jekado> if your team dies your pc dies
[2:09:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> or hover over the window to isolate it
[2:09:25] <akman14> Can't you make a new desktop???
[2:09:25] <Mighty_observer> be honest pat, the devs want honesty!!
[2:09:26] <jeosadn> windows key + D to minimize it ?
[2:09:27] <%KaizenChaos> Alt+Tab?
[2:09:28] <kylejefferies> ALT + F4

[2:09:35] <DomunDomunDomun> ctrl+alt+del for interrupt, if you used ctrl+shift+esc
[2:09:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh god yeah, I know that problem. time to pull the plug lol
[2:09:35] <HimakiLuvsU> ALT F4

[2:09:38] <nerdblase> Taskkill /im xcom.exe /f
[2:09:38] <%YakumoYomi> I'm guessing Alt+Tab and Windows Key don't work?
[2:09:41] <doggieo> ctrl alt del?
[2:09:43] <%Ixiah> cant u just rightclick on the tab on the bottom and close ?

[2:10:08] <%trianglehat> and open taskmanager on new desktop

[2:14:33] <%dukenux> you could save those ten minutes if youd just restart the cimputer
[2:14:35] <drewslo> just keep opening things till the computer crashes
[2:14:36] <KingKZ> Pour water on it. That'll get something to happen.

[2:14:40] <latgeek> mjbAyy
[2:14:40] <+caffienatedjedi> @Garthunox Why? Because it crashed once? Xcom games are pretty crash happy in general, I'll admit.
[2:14:41] <%Darren716> Wow when it crashed for me earlier i thought it was because i was running this on a 6 year old laptop
[2:14:46] <honeyman18> Is Pat installing hacks or something?
[2:14:47] <%Darren716> Turns out the game is just busted
[2:14:48] <%manwithboxonhead> Just execute the PC for gross incompetence.
