[0:37:16] <%arcielardor> coincidentally enough that's the same noise you make when you've had too much cocaine
[0:37:17] <%Monkeyweed21> you are a Tim Allen noise
[0:37:19] <%bevyrage> then listen to bustin'
[0:37:22] <FourthGuardJuan> But the charge shield was crazy banana bonkers
[0:37:23] <%SaiyanShoto> @ipsenscastle because they hated him
[0:37:27] <+BigHooppaw> When are you going to get Tim Alen on the podcast??
[0:37:27] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:37:28] <%Jhylla81> Imagine if this game gets a screw attack and/or a space jump
[0:37:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good thing all this delicate equipment is activated by sword slashes
[0:37:53] <%Bailey__gaming> Bailey__gaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! thanks for the stream and keeping me smiling say thanks to Paige for the same . keep on keeping on
[0:38:07] <%eyebrowsgames> VoHiYo Where's the giant lady this evening?
[0:38:13] <%BoxNavy> :(
[0:38:22] <FourthGuardJuan> is there a lantern above the reactor switch?
[0:38:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Don't wanna get that charge shot Pat?
[0:39:19] <+Fooguwu> so never
[0:39:20] <%BoxNavy> hes right
[0:39:23] <%Taisuru> Dumbass
[0:39:26] <%Agami23> i hope at some point you get zeros kuuenzan
[0:39:28] <rufus2k2> you mean the checkpoints that carry over to other checkpoints
[0:39:30] <FourthGuardJuan> boss spots only is the right move
[0:39:34] <rufus2k2> you mind goblin'd nutcase
[0:39:34] <%Taisuru> Money is LITERALLY unlimited
[0:39:36] <%AzureGale> Pat is going to have 9999 money at the end of the game
[0:39:43] <+gitgouda> oh damn what is this some sort of metroid ninja action? it looks cool.
[0:39:50] <%eyebrowsgames> what is this game?
[0:39:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> You get enough money per level for that tho
[0:39:54] <%AzureGale> This is reminding me of that one Awkward Zombie comic about Fire Emblem
[0:39:56] <%BoxNavy> i have a feeling you wont even need them later
[0:40:00] <dfs_k> the game is really good, but it still feels less well designed than shovelknight, with less interesting stuff and in some small ways regressed, still fun but a shame
[0:40:06] <rufus2k2> @gitgouda ye, cyber shadow, released recently
[0:40:10] <%arcielardor> hey Pat your money is an odd number
[0:40:15] <+BigHooppaw> Keep that money under your mattress Pat
[0:40:15] <+jinking79> jinking79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! feeling better
[0:40:33] <Giztech> was it your mum that you said that you were cool :D
[0:40:33] <rufus2k2> @dfs_k everything sadly can't be shovel knight, I still think the devs did a bang up job from what we've seen here
[0:40:33] <%eyebrowsgames> this like a Megaman type thing?
[0:40:36] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:40:39] <%AzureGale> wat
[0:40:40] <%Broand> He actually means he wants to play with a gimped moveset as possible for the challenge
[0:40:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> wut
[0:40:48] <servicesuspension> more like a ninja gaiden type thing
[0:40:49] <rufus2k2> go spend more free Warframe money you madman
[0:40:53] <%BoxNavy> they should manifest the object out of nothing
[0:40:54] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah if I have the money for a stock they have to give it to me
[0:40:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> lol totally
[0:41:00] <SteveJobsIsStillAlive> pat will you pour one out for the hedge fund managers? I hear some aren't able to afford chris redfields coat (times 100000) Kappa
[0:41:01] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:41:01] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Businesses have the right to refuse service to anyone
[0:41:03] <+gitgouda> Yes.
[0:41:09] <%AzureGale> What if I don't have a dick
[0:41:10] <+b_aleph> Yeah, they SHOULD suck my dick
[0:41:10] <+Pengers> yes
[0:41:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> That's what NASDAQ is trying to avoid with GME rn XD
[0:41:13] <%SirGO0SE> dick suck economy is booming Kreygasm
[0:41:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oh wow, this is literally Ninja Shovel Knight
[0:41:16] <@SoFarFetched> why not get a PS5 AND get your dick sucked.
[0:41:28] <rufus2k2> pat i'm really not jivving with these LowTierGod esque philosophies you got going on
[0:41:29] <+gitgouda> ninja gaiden meets metroid.
[0:41:32] <%bunchaghosts> just take down the ps5 sign
[0:41:32] <%thedankestmeeme> A THOUSAND TIMES YES
[0:41:32] <%SirGO0SE> gotta get managers with them nice lips
[0:41:34] <+mikesapartment> hiring the ones who give the best head??
[0:41:37] <%wibbwobbler> hrrmmm
[0:41:40] <falsecrabmeat> Managerial experience has a whole new meaning
[0:41:40] <%arcielardor> THE SCALPER SHOULD HAVE TO EUCK YO DICK!!
[0:41:43] <+gitgouda> no wait some shinobi 3 in there too
[0:41:44] <+b_aleph> There's a great manager around the corner of my street
[0:41:44] <%sniffy77> Hey Pat, if you're gonna get the covid vaccine I would suggest you take the day after the vaccine appt off from streaming. I got hit with some big chills and nausea the day after.
[0:41:49] <%BoxNavy> pat you have no lips
[0:41:51] <%AncelDeLambert> guys I think Pat is trying to tell us something
[0:41:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Don't they do that already?
[0:41:55] <%SirGO0SE> Welcome to Sony we give the BEST head :)
[0:41:56] <vonmaultke> I demand CEO level suck
[0:41:56] <%ClericOfSparda> @azuregale Time to munch some carpet then, manager!
[0:41:59] <+UnderseaMagic> they'd hire you because you're the perfect height :)
[0:42:08] <%Taisuru> Obviously fake
[0:42:09] <%Agami23> i'd do it for less
[0:42:14] <%SirGO0SE> @UnderseaMagic got em :D
[0:42:15] <+BigHooppaw> cyber milkers
[0:42:15] <rufus2k2> I think pat needs a taste of the rolled up newspaper
[0:42:22] <servicesuspension> feels like a trap
[0:42:30] <%SirGO0SE> haha doody
[0:42:43] <%Taisuru> Charge blaster = shield
[0:42:45] <+mikesapartment> if only there was a way to get more sp
[0:42:55] <+gitgouda> noice.
[0:43:04] <rufus2k2> pat :GOTTA GROW LARGE also pat:GOTTA SAVE IT FOR LATER~
[0:43:12] <servicesuspension> is this progress
[0:43:21] <servicesuspension> oh
[0:43:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> sequel to crumbly floor, now presenting zappy floor
[0:43:45] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:43:48] <%BoxNavy> hard agree
[0:44:07] <+BigHooppaw> consumables are useless
[0:44:14] <servicesuspension> consumables suck
[0:44:16] <heartlesshealer> How Cyber Shadow so far? Just got here
[0:44:18] <%SirGO0SE> tfw no hot consumable gf
[0:44:27] <%Dakuu75> consumables are just abilities with a cooldown and limit
[0:44:28] <+Kilik_> except revive items in RPGs
[0:44:29] <servicesuspension> though when I have them I like to use all of them
[0:44:34] <+RyTYoung> God Pat is gonna clear this game in a day and it's taken me 3 nooo
[0:44:44] <%Taisuru> I love it personally
[0:44:50] <penitentpendant> Random Shout out to my continuing hatred of FF8
[0:44:52] <servicesuspension> cooldowns are cool, but day cooldown is fuck
[0:44:52] <%AzureGale> But it was cool in Fire Emblem: THree Houses
[0:44:55] <%Agami23> i like spell slots
[0:44:59] <%snow_bush> Its fine for TRPG but video games need spontanious/mana casting.
[0:45:02] <Zedkan> there are better magic systems in tabletop tho
[0:45:04] <%Taisuru> Pat, are you sure YOU just don't hate it?
[0:45:07] <%arcielardor> SPHERES OF POWER FOR LIFE
[0:45:18] <%snow_bush> Now the better question, Spontaneous Spells or Prepared?
[0:45:23] <servicesuspension> you use it once and its GONE for the day
[0:45:26] <%BoxNavy> thats fucking terrible
[0:45:26] <%AzureGale> Vancian Magic is like church magic right
[0:45:27] <ARDM112> Eh it works fine in DS1-2
[0:45:27] <heartlesshealer> sounds like you treat consumables like Nioh in this game so far
[0:45:28] <Zedkan> @arcielardor IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
[0:45:30] <%Valdorick> Study? Why study? Just have your dad fuck a dragon.
[0:45:31] <%0rond> like dark souls
[0:45:35] <heartlesshealer> but Vancian spellcasting is shit
[0:45:51] <%YakumoYomi> That's why I play Sorceror
[0:45:57] <%arcielardor> @zedkan Damn straight
[0:46:00] <servicesuspension> I like it when spells have a cooldown to avoid repetition, also spell synergy
[0:46:02] <heartlesshealer> only play Sorceror or Oracle <3
[0:46:03] <j___a___c___k___> I think pat should play NOITA
[0:46:08] <%SirGO0SE> its true
[0:46:19] <%snow_bush> Black Tentacles is the spell we all should love.
[0:46:21] <%Taisuru> It still is, it's just baby mode
[0:46:26] <servicesuspension> ideally there should be few skills and few items
[0:46:35] <%SirGO0SE> for 3 houses you want to use them all
[0:46:36] <%snow_bush> Always prepare a spell slot.
[0:46:39] <%SirGO0SE> or try
[0:46:42] <%BoxNavy> im just taking in how cool the enemy designs are in this game
[0:46:46] <Louie_Salmon> @j___a___c___k___ That game is a Pat nightmare where literally everything is an unidentified consumable
[0:46:51] <+RyTYoung> magika has a good magic system
[0:46:58] <%Pappajimbo> it would work in games if it makes resting risky so you cant just spam it
[0:47:04] <%SirGO0SE> magika's system rules
[0:47:05] <%Valdorick> Hot Take - FF1 became shit when the updates replaced spell slots with MP
[0:47:18] <servicesuspension> VR MISSIONS
[0:47:20] <%AzureGale> We Mega Man Zero 3 now
[0:47:22] <brovietto> I'M IN
[0:47:23] <+gitgouda> cyber ninja
[0:47:25] <Ner234> You missed something
[0:47:29] <j___a___c___k___> @Louie_Salmon hahaha lol , but no, theres ways to know
[0:47:31] <Louie_Salmon> Cyberpunk 2077

[0:47:51] <+gitgouda> whoops
[0:47:55] <j___a___c___k___> TIME TO HACK
[0:47:56] <%Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! So I have been thinking about starting something new in my life and being the lazy procrastinator that I am, covid and various other things have provided convenient excuses. What is something you have pushed off recently that could potentially benefit you
[0:47:56] <+RowenCleric> no gem checkpoints here
[0:48:00] <+Ner071o> I'm getting Shadow of the Ninja on NES vibes from this game. It has some of the SFX for sure, no doubt.
[0:48:08] <heartlesshealer> Is Pat becoming a Hater, a la Let It Die?
[0:48:09] <DrGasMax> Just had to take a break on the 9th level because a segment is so hard, have fun Pat!
[0:48:14] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[0:48:20] <+Ipsenscastle> :(
[0:48:23] <Sol_Install> D:
[0:48:26] <%BinaryFireball> now we can do this the easy way or the hard way
[0:48:30] <LordOfThePoultry> WutFace
[0:48:31] <%BoxNavy> SHUT UP
[0:48:31] <rufus2k2> can't you just give dogs a vasectomy?
[0:48:31] <%BinaryFireball> I see your electing the hard way
[0:48:34] <%PanicSwytch> Why are u staring at his balls?
[0:48:37] <servicesuspension> HUGE BALLS, RIP AND TEAR YOUR BALLS
[0:48:39] <heartlesshealer> balls are supposed to be huge
[0:48:42] <+RyTYoung> @heartlesshealer I miss Let It Die gotta get back into it
[0:48:48] <Sol_Install> Pat scared
[0:48:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is in big-huge give up mode
[0:48:51] <%bevyrage> don't be envious of gief's confidence for showing his balls JUST BECAUSE you don't like showing yours on stream pat
[0:48:54] <j___a___c___k___> @Louie_Salmon I actually think pat would get addicted to the difficult of Noita
[0:48:59] <+Ipsenscastle> if you get rid of his balls he will come for yours in the night
[0:49:09] <%asgard147> brain is dying
[0:49:11] <DrGasMax> It is crazy how many parts of this game can be done much easier and you don't do it because you overthink it
[0:49:12] <%Agami23> pat thought about vancian spellcasting and now he is pissed
[0:49:15] <wannabemoogle> dog has balls pat has orb
[0:49:23] <%BinaryFireball> like the lantern fish he will absorb all balls
[0:49:48] <%BinaryFireball> glad I could settle that
[0:49:52] <j___a___c___k___> orbs of steel
[0:49:56] <%SirGO0SE> haha thats what she said amiright fellas
[0:49:57] <heartlesshealer> Doesn't lantern fish absorb the whole male?
[0:50:02] <servicesuspension> are we out of brain juice
[0:50:09] <%BinaryFireball> I think so
[0:50:10] <%Agami23> maybe upgrade the checkpoint?
[0:50:16] <+RyTYoung> The checkpoint placement in this game is much like Shovel Knight
[0:50:21] <%BinaryFireball> I guess the balls are technically not absorbed but are just... attached
[0:50:29] <DrGasMax> oh Pat does have wall slide, he is just not using it
[0:50:33] <heartlesshealer> still pretty neat cycle of sacrificial reproduction
[0:50:37] <servicesuspension> when outta brain juice, 5 min break
[0:50:39] <%Jhylla81> the balls are inert
[0:50:40] <%SirGO0SE> hey @PatStaresAt have you seen the balldo yet?
[0:50:42] <RLT917> @heartlesshealer male bites female and slowly merges with her flesh
[0:50:46] <%BinaryFireball> pretty metal
[0:50:47] <%ChungusQuest> "We have become ONE!"
[0:50:55] <+RyTYoung> @drgasmax it's not something he started the game with
[0:50:56] <servicesuspension> that is horrifying
[0:51:01] <%BoxNavy> yeah pat look at the Balldo
[0:51:06] <%BinaryFireball> also you guys ever wonder why oysters dont just spit out the pearl?
[0:51:10] <%BinaryFireball> seems so uncomfy
[0:51:25] <%BoxNavy> someone tweet pat the Balldo
[0:51:35] <Jnkolm> Hackerman
[0:51:39] <DrGasMax> Well he needs to use it more, the game only gets tougher and requires use of the unlocked abilities
[0:51:42] <heartlesshealer> nature is cool‚Ñ¢
[0:51:42] <%BinaryFireball> whats a balldo?
[0:51:46] <+RyTYoung> Wait I thought you couldn't retry this shit if you died...
[0:51:55] <servicesuspension> like a hairdo for balls
[0:52:01] <%SirGO0SE> @BinaryFireball I'll wait for you to google it :)

[0:52:25] <%Jaxnos> Pat, it's bedtime
[0:52:25] <heartlesshealer> I think they can't spit things out in the first place, which is why the pearl ends up being made instead of dirt and sand just being ejected from the oyster
[0:52:25] <DrGasMax> yep I know that feeling

[0:53:40] <%BoxNavy> the balldo is cool
[0:53:40] <%AzureGale> I prefer Waldo
[0:53:45] <%YakumoYomi> Ball Dildo. Literally
[0:53:47] <heartlesshealer> Balldo doesn't seem like it would work well
[0:53:50] <+RyTYoung> WALDO HATES BALLDO
[0:53:50] <%Starotter70> We'll always talk about Baldo
[0:53:54] <%Jaxnos> Waldo's balldos
[0:53:54] <%BinaryFireball> @RLT917 oh god

[0:54:00] <%BoxNavy> we all do
[0:54:04] <SomersaultJustice> what about Balto?
[0:54:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I know how Twitch works too: it doesn't
[0:54:08] <%asgard147> DON'T GOOGLE THAT
[0:54:13] <%AzureGale> wat
[0:54:17] <%BinaryFireball> so it's not ball haircuts?
[0:54:18] <%ChungusQuest> that sounds painful
[0:54:20] <%Agami23> yeah thats weird.
[0:54:22] <%SirGO0SE> im crying
[0:54:23] <%YakumoYomi> Balto is a good movie
[0:54:24] <+RyTYoung> WHY
[0:54:25] <heartlesshealer> seems a poor idea
[0:54:26] <%Spydurman> everyone always say where's Waldo? How come no one says where's Balldo?
[0:54:27] <Ner234> Why does this exist? Honestly confused.
[0:54:28] <%BoxNavy> no binary its not
[0:54:29] <%BinaryFireball> or the ball jacuzzi?
[0:54:30] <%Dakuu75> Pat stop pulling a Plague, and teaching us stuff we don't wanna know.
[0:54:32] <wannabemoogle> what
[0:54:34] <+UnderseaMagic> think they was on YKS
[0:54:34] <%BoxNavy> its a ball dildo
[0:54:35] <servicesuspension> INNOVATION

[0:54:54] <j___a___c___k___> baldo's gate
[0:54:55] <%Jaxnos> it exists because the balls are wide
[0:54:58] <DrGasMax> Some people use ball dildos and some people Yolo their live savings on Gamestop stock

[0:56:53] <heartlesshealer> yeah, cutting off the testosterone factory changes dogs a LOT. So be aware
[0:56:57] <%Dunmarkh> The same would happen if paige removed your testicles pat.
[0:57:00] <Midnight188> he is busy practicing his normals
[0:57:00] <cherrycottontail> i too lose energy and become a lard-ass when my balls are cut off
[0:57:04] <%MisterRockett> Zengif is not aware of this fact.
[0:57:04] <%BoxNavy> @SirGO0SE they have to get him the balldo before its too late
[0:57:09] <%crimsonharvest> yeah you should check out a high energy dog

[0:57:15] <T_Sasquatch> He's all chubby weight

[0:57:41] <%walternatorz> you actively complain about your dog getting boners
[0:57:42] <%BinaryFireball> they put arms and a face on balls
[0:57:42] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> she should've been

[0:59:26] <+gimmickypizza> Ball dogs
[0:59:34] <Sol_Install> This game is messing with me cause of playing "The Messager" like I expect to double jump after hitting an enemy
[0:59:35] <servicesuspension> keep his balls like my mom kept my teeth
[0:59:39] <%BoxNavy> he did know what he meant

[0:59:59] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[1:00:04] <%BinaryFireball> I wonder if you could use the balldo on a boob
[1:00:09] <ReRe0183> how long you had zangief
[1:00:17] <%SirGO0SE> boobdo PogChamp
[1:00:22] <DrGasMax> Pat's Brain Goblins are gonna fucking hate this game and make it so much harder for him for no reason
[1:00:24] <%BinaryFireball> that would be a power move to fuck 2 people at once with your bobs
[1:00:26] <%BoxNavy> BOOBDO
[1:00:27] <+RyTYoung> @binaryfireball That terrifies me
[1:00:33] <rufus2k2> they're not fully destroyed pat
[1:00:45] <TheHeroAppears> it's on gamepass

[1:00:49] <reyntime180> Whats this game for?
[1:00:50] <%crimsonharvest> like the very NES-Batman-architecture
[1:00:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I suck at ades
[1:00:55] <%BinaryFireball> @RyTYoung the night is dark and filled with balldos

[1:01:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> @UmoLoco Yes
[1:01:13] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[1:01:13] <reyntime180> Is it on steam?
[1:01:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DrGasMax It's already happening, he's bought upgrades maybe 5 times
[1:01:24] <%BinaryFireball> If I cornered the market i would need WSB on my side to take it to the moon
[1:01:28] <%YakumoYomi> Gesundheit
[1:01:28] <rufus2k2> BONE DRAGON
[1:01:31] <+UmoLoco> @rumtumtugnutz oh hell yeah!
[1:01:31] <heartlesshealer> just give up on that pillar, no horizontal
[1:01:33] <%BinaryFireball> so then the aliens could get some boobdo
[1:01:34] <+RyTYoung> @binaryfireball Knife wielding balldo's waiting to penetrate the only way they know
[1:01:37] <rufus2k2> go back to castlevania
[1:01:48] <ReRe0183> switch bless you
[1:01:54] <%Jaxnos> das the option
[1:01:54] <%BinaryFireball> holy shit that's worse than crabs with knives
[1:01:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is this Megaman Zero
[1:01:59] <+UmoLoco> Why is their music always so good!?
[1:02:07] <%Taisuru> Buy the upgrades pat I hate you
[1:02:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's the good shield
[1:02:09] <%Jhylla81> E field is that shield thing you liked
[1:02:12] <%Taisuru> (I love you)
[1:02:13] <Giztech> oh she super dead
[1:02:14] <shaddydaddyo> catJAM
[1:02:17] <%BinaryFireball> Because he was developing the balldo 2.0
[1:02:31] <%BoxNavy> argh pat ahhhh you have to upgrade ahhh
[1:02:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I WILL get mad, thank you
[1:02:37] <%Jaxnos> you love flying buddy shield, don't lie
[1:02:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> But now you have cool shield
[1:02:45] <rufus2k2> the next souls game I'm gonna scream at pat to stop getting huge
[1:02:48] <rufus2k2> just you wait
[1:02:54] <@SoFarFetched> Wonder if that's an achievement to beat the game with no upgrade geefThink
[1:02:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> and still a crazy amount of points
[1:03:04] <rufus2k2> "stop using souls pat, what are you doing!"
[1:03:04] <heartlesshealer> why hurt to upgrade? You have 539
[1:03:05] <DrGasMax> oh fucking man, he almost at the thing?
[1:03:09] <+UmoLoco> You can stop Pat from getting BIG
[1:03:13] <%ChungusQuest> Pat, I'm so glad you work on proper audio setup. My buddy sneezed into his mic the other day and it hurt worse than being at a metal concert
[1:03:14] <heartlesshealer> this isn't Red Orbs
[1:03:22] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:03:22] <%arcielardor> It's Pat's stream. If he wants to suck like a scrub lord, let him suck like a scrub lord.
[1:03:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> like
[1:03:25] <rufus2k2> Yeah...YEAH
[1:03:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "But what if I need it later?!!"
[1:03:27] <%BinaryFireball> Eve Online
[1:03:27] <@SoFarFetched> Then Pat would Cease to be
[1:03:33] <heartlesshealer> there's many
[1:03:35] <%BinaryFireball> but you would most likely die
[1:03:37] <%SirGO0SE> i think your goblins would just understand that its a different situation
[1:03:37] <%Agami23> no because you'll just play a different game
[1:03:41] <servicesuspension> BUT BABA
[1:03:41] <Hammerknife> easy. every level has randomly generated hidden secrets, and all items are marked as 'key' items even if they're not
[1:03:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> You mean Dragon Age Inquisitionm?
[1:03:46] <TheHeroAppears> are you really you without your goblins?
[1:03:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is Baba is Poor
[1:03:46] <heartlesshealer> you would probably hate them though
[1:03:49] <$Invlux> Sticker Star
[1:03:50] <peachy996> You'd stop playing it
[1:03:54] <DrGasMax> oh no I came here to laugh at him suffering and dying at the parts I also suffered and died at
[1:03:55] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> MINECRAFT
[1:04:01] <+UmoLoco> Is this Shovel Knight quality?
[1:04:02] <%BinaryFireball> how do you want to kill your goblins?
[1:04:18] <servicesuspension> estus woop estus woop
[1:04:22] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> so dishonored?
[1:04:29] <%Dakuu75> So, in MHW you never used demon drug or hardshell powder and shit?
[1:04:33] <rufus2k2> @UmoLoco that's a heavy order
[1:04:41] <+thackattack00> Why do you refuse to gain power?
[1:04:43] <%AzureGale> ok
[1:04:51] <%BinaryFireball> difficulty spikes always piss me off tbh
[1:04:52] <heartlesshealer> Do [recharge] items count as consumeables? Like Estus?
[1:04:52] <penitentpendant> Praise Yakuza and their take on consumables: "You can just go buy them."
[1:04:53] <shaddydaddyo> @Dakuu75 That's different because you can easily get more
[1:04:54] <%crimsonharvest> i've started trying to use consumables as soon as there's any reason to use them at all
[1:04:59] <Hammerknife> design the game to scale with difficulty depending on the # of consumables used
[1:04:59] <%Taisuru> @Dakuu75 Those are functionally infinite
[1:05:00] <+gimmickypizza> use consumables as soon as you get them
[1:05:00] <rufus2k2> maybe a degree below Shovel knight first release
[1:05:03] <+UmoLoco> @rufus2k2 Spectre Knight was
[1:05:09] <PirateMike_> Cyberpunk looks weird
[1:05:11] <%Jhylla81> The knife in castlevania is useless
[1:05:12] <%BoxNavy> demondrug is fine cus it lasts the whole hunt and yeah you can make more
[1:05:16] <servicesuspension> less items is better items
[1:05:20] <%BinaryFireball> difficulty spikes ruin the flow of a game and take me out of it
[1:05:22] <brunoberserk> sorry pat , i dont understand your mental gymnastics
[1:05:28] <%CzeekyPlays> Tim Rodgers FF7R review convinced me consumables are evil
[1:05:29] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> actually, consumables in the binding of isaac are super optimising
[1:05:33] <%Dakuu75> -I guess
[1:05:39] <+Kilik_> consumables in MHW can on the whole be farmed whilst playing with the crop box so that's a nice one
[1:05:39] <%crimsonharvest> Is this doing like an R-Type style shield that just block anything
[1:05:42] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> as in, they require you to optimise hard
[1:05:52] <DrGasMax> Pat is now inflicted with the Mind Goblin of "My throwing stars no longer exist." I know that one pretty well myself
[1:06:01] <shaddydaddyo> I had no idea Cyber Shadow came out
[1:06:06] <%Jhylla81> The only consumables I hoard are MP items
[1:06:07] <heartlesshealer> onto spikes oof
[1:06:09] <%Agami23> but you did in dead cells
[1:06:16] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt than why didn't you spend money in dead cells?
[1:06:18] <+gimmickypizza> But if you use the consumable you‚Äôll have a clear inventory aesthetic
[1:06:20] <rufus2k2> @UmoLoco yeah but that's from the same Yacht Club devs and liek years after its release?
[1:06:26] <%ChungusQuest> but in Hades you need that gold for the really good stuff at the end, makes the Well feel like a trap
[1:06:28] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> mmmmmm how about the currency system in metro?
[1:06:45] <%Dakuu75> this feels like a very situational argument
[1:06:49] <Shwepie> Dell Cells broke Pat's brain.
[1:06:53] <shaddydaddyo> god yes hades
[1:06:54] <DrGasMax> Is it good game design if the game constantly tricks you into thinking it is harder than it actually is?
[1:06:59] <%Agami23> a hammer is pretty good
[1:07:12] <@SoFarFetched> yeah and Hades tells you its better to just spend your money instead of holding onto it.
[1:07:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> sometimes theres a better deal in the same area
[1:07:26] <+Dova573> man i wanted to like dead cells, but it dosent feel quite right
[1:07:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> and its frustrting
[1:07:28] <%arcielardor> you can force a hammer room tho
[1:07:33] <%ChungusQuest> Is a boon really a consumable though?
[1:07:47] <%0rond> @SoFarFetched it doesn't though, there's a big huge shop with permanent upgrades at the very end
[1:07:48] <+TheBitingIrish> I feel like Dead Cells scales too quickly
[1:07:58] <servicesuspension> When I have consumables in games I just use them because it feels weird not to. Paper Mario was really bad about useless consumables.
[1:08:00] <@SoFarFetched> @0rond oh no I mean what skelly tells you.
[1:08:03] <rufus2k2> @DrGasMax I feel like that's tricky because you can struggle against an enemy in a game and barely eke out a win, then see someone bulldoze it no problem. Seeing speedrunners play DMC4 recently is crazy
[1:08:04] <TheHeroAppears> stockpiling gold is fine in hades because of the last segment
[1:08:06] <servicesuspension> I think most games deserve a hard mode
[1:08:19] <@SoFarFetched> cause I remember he had a line dialogue about spending money during runs
[1:08:20] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah, and there's the health drain hammer upgrade too, that changes your playstyle for the rest of the run
[1:08:20] <servicesuspension> With a hard mode, consumables become valuable
[1:08:23] <%BinaryFireball> I like consumables if they need to constantly be used to play the game. Like potions or fuel
[1:08:32] <bashful_bard> Dead cells scaled too quickly in early access as well
[1:08:50] <%0rond> DMC4 speedruns are all about consumables, they are about glitching the game for infinite holy water
[1:08:56] <servicesuspension> weird consumables like status effect shit is only fun if the other way is too hard or precious
[1:08:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> this game feels so much like Blame! for some reason
[1:08:58] <Hammerknife> i feel like it's easy to just track consumable use and modify the game based on the player's usage pattern
[1:09:00] <servicesuspension> less is more
[1:09:04] <+ultimafullmetal> I couldn't get into Hades. Rogue likes just aren't for me I guess

[1:10:00] <Hammerknife> pat how did you feel about the food in dragon's dogma that went bad if you held onto it too long
[1:10:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> You're just too spiteful for that Pat
[1:10:08] <Shwepie> Pat just doubles down on bad habits like his psychology degree taught him to do.
[1:10:11] <+lethallunacyx> for a normal person maybe
[1:10:12] <%Taisuru> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[1:10:15] <%cowardman93> well it would be a good way Pat but remember you're an asshole so you thrive off it
[1:10:15] <PirateMike_> Is that bigfoot on pats shirt?
[1:10:19] <servicesuspension> consumables that rot are their own kind of hell
[1:10:21] <+Kilik_> @PatStaresAt it reinforces them because you will continue them to spite us
[1:10:31] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:10:32] <+Ipsenscastle> @Hammerknife you just upset me by saying that
[1:10:41] <1matheuw> !uptime
[1:10:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 10m.
[1:10:48] <%Ranryu692> if anything, the constant criticism has created NEW bad habits, such as intentionally mispronouncing words to hide the real ones
[1:10:49] <Hammerknife> i thought pat liked dragon's dogma
[1:10:50] <%bunchaghosts> You need to acknowledge that the goblins are trying to keep you safe, then tell them thank you, not now though I don't need you atm
[1:11:01] <%arcielardor> Are speedruns impossible for you because of the goblins?
[1:11:08] <narusao> cause goblins?
[1:11:10] <%Agami23> man tartarus is so much cooler than momentos
[1:11:16] <%BoxNavy> you should for real speedrun re2
[1:11:22] <%BoxNavy> like submit a run
[1:11:28] <%SirGO0SE> gotta remove the goblin limiters
[1:11:32] <heartlesshealer> speedrunning seems to be a major danger
[1:11:33] <servicesuspension> gobbo 100% speedrun should be it's own cathegory
[1:11:34] <Djinnazz> that whole first section ytou only need 2c knifes.,
[1:11:49] <bashful_bard> RE2 runs are like crazy optimized
[1:12:13] <%asgard147> not everybody is meant to speedrun pat, it's okay limesOk
[1:12:15] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> any% all unnecessary pickups
[1:12:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Did anyone elses sound go away just now?
[1:12:34] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> i hear the getting over it speedrun is under 1 minute now.
[1:12:36] <+EySoyCoco> speedwalk 100%
[1:12:38] <heartlesshealer> 100%?
[1:12:39] <%BinaryFireball> 100%?
[1:12:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> 100%
[1:12:41] <BluBox> A 100% run
[1:12:42] <%Hiro01231> 100% run
[1:12:43] <%BoxNavy> 100%
[1:12:44] <%cowardman93> a Patrun
[1:12:45] <%Taisuru> Just wanna point out that you've re-earned what you payed for the shield already
[1:12:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh it's back
[1:12:49] <%AzureGale> Speedrun 100%
[1:12:54] <DetroitSentai> 100%, all items, speedruns have all sorts of categories
[1:12:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> That was weird
[1:13:03] <%Agami23> also pat, you will never be the worst. i used to purposely damage my self in games to pick up HP items
[1:13:11] <+smuggleruncle> LULW same
[1:13:11] <%cowardman93> cause it fun
[1:13:14] <+smuggleruncle> LUL
[1:13:19] <PirateMike_> Same thing with New Vegas for me
[1:13:26] <PirateMike_> Always play the same path
[1:13:28] <%Taisuru> STAND ON THE LEDGE GOOBER
[1:13:30] <Hammerknife> if i cant use this health item then nobody can @Agami23 '
[1:13:33] <heartlesshealer> what are you trying to jump shoot???
[1:13:34] <Djinnazz> Same thing with Darksouls
[1:13:35] <+smuggleruncle> and it's STILL fun
[1:13:41] <1matheuw> i think you have to jump higher pat
[1:13:42] <%0rond> every single dark souls run I had devolved into pyromancy and a katana
[1:13:48] <%asgard147> cos it's a good way to play it AND the game is fun
[1:13:54] <bashful_bard> I had similar troubles gunning for the 12000 steps achievement. Failed 2 runs bc I kept taking ammo or upgrade detours
[1:14:09] <heartlesshealer> never BotW =)
[1:14:10] <brunoberserk> not for you
[1:14:12] <penitentpendant> Disco Elysium broke me of my save scuming
[1:14:12] <heartlesshealer> koroks
[1:14:13] <%AzureGale> Dupe trick for days?
[1:14:18] <%SirGO0SE> in BOTW i stockpile the good weapons until they become outclassed LUL
[1:14:18] <servicesuspension> you should do a goblin killing stream in which you betray every single habit so we can see you suffer
[1:14:25] <%Agami23> fuck breath of the wild and the durability bullshit
[1:14:26] <%BoxNavy> botw is a goblin inducer not a poison
[1:14:27] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt Beyond Two Souls lets you get William DaFoe killed, does that count?
[1:14:32] <Hammerknife> so did pat ever beat any of the dead rising games
[1:14:44] <Hammerknife> i feel as though the dead rising games are pure mind goblin fuel
[1:14:54] <+NovaKnightmare> oh wait u mean mindgoblins, not actual goblins
[1:14:57] <%Taisuru> @Agami23 The durability shit was totally fine, they game should have told people that breaking wepaons leveled up weapons in the world
[1:15:01] <servicesuspension> my goblin is that goblins should be gremlins. they tinker with stuff, it fits better
[1:15:06] <BoneBagMel> that's just a megabuster
[1:15:07] <%AncelDeLambert> AUTO CHARGE SHOT
[1:15:08] <LordOfThePoultry> hell yeah keep your inventory full by only using the master sword
[1:15:10] <Palmtuna> Disco Elysium didn't break me of save scumming, it just broke me
[1:15:10] <1matheuw> ye
[1:15:11] <heartlesshealer> megaman option
[1:15:14] <PirateMike_> @penitentpendant Disco Elysium is so fucking good.
[1:15:15] <bashful_bard> Dead Rising is peak mind goblins
[1:15:15] <%cowardman93> I don't think any game can break the goblins Pat, just cause another game will reinforce it
[1:15:15] <%asgard147> me too, I think that's aflaw of that game really
[1:15:19] <%AzureGale> boss tiem
[1:15:19] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> goblinslayer pat
[1:15:21] <%AncelDeLambert> they did it they actually made it auto charge!!!
[1:15:26] <%Starotter70> SourPls
[1:15:28] <%SirGO0SE> is disco still on sale?
[1:15:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck this music is killer
[1:15:30] <%BoxNavy> OH SHIT
[1:15:30] <heartlesshealer> whooah!
[1:15:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> in Breathe of the wild, an item I needed for a puzzle flew out of the dungeon and I couldn't find it again. So I had to solve the puzzle by aligning all my metal items to form a circuit.
[1:15:32] <%Taisuru> BALL SNAKE
[1:15:33] <servicesuspension> why would you build that!
[1:15:43] <1matheuw> OH shit bois is gigaspid
[1:15:44] <%asgard147> limesD
[1:15:49] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:15:50] <%Jhylla81> My issue with durability in BotW is you can't repair weapons
[1:15:52] <%Dunmarkh> cause it's cool
[1:15:53] <%asgard147> MEKADRAGON limesD
[1:15:54] <%wibbwobbler> completionist vid on hyrule warriors is nuts
[1:15:57] <LordOfThePoultry> YOOOOOOO
[1:15:58] <%SirGO0SE> @goose_attack_almanac i know the exact shrine youre talking about, and thats also how I did it LUL
[1:15:59] <+mikesapartment> this boss is terrible
[1:16:01] <%NovaKnightmare> this track is SICK
[1:16:10] <+Ipsenscastle> this track is kinda cool
[1:16:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> from the studio that brought you crumbly floor and zappy floor comes floaty floor
[1:16:22] <1matheuw> this is straight up a megaman zx fight
[1:16:23] <%Agami23> @Taisuru it does? i avoided breakign weapons because what if i need the weapon later
[1:16:27] <%SirGO0SE> the shrines that use the gyro in botw infuriate me
[1:16:30] <%ChungusQuest> that Mega Man gun seems pretty perfect for this fight
[1:16:33] <Hammerknife> i was playing the OG divinity game, divine divinity, and i realized early on that no enemies respawn and that the amount of xp you earn is fixed
[1:16:44] <servicesuspension> is the gun dying
[1:16:46] <Hammerknife> so i tried to play it so i could last hit every enemy and prevent allied npcs from taking the last hit
[1:16:54] <bashful_bard> What a cool boss idea
[1:17:01] <%Taisuru> @Agami23 Yes, you get stronger weapons and eventually even weapons with elemental bonuses added to them
[1:17:02] <Hammerknife> was the absolute worst
[1:17:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love how the items get visually damaged when they're about to go away
[1:17:11] <+gitgouda> there goes 3 sp
[1:17:12] <heartlesshealer> bye option
[1:17:15] <heartlesshealer> it died
[1:17:20] <+gitgouda> not like he dosnt get it back right away
[1:17:26] <+TheBitingIrish> @goose_attack_almanac That's fucking rad

[1:17:35] <%cowardman93> GIEF TIME!
[1:17:38] <%Agami23> @Taisuru that sounds like really poor game design, because whats to stop me from just sitting around breaking weapons all day until i get good ones?

[1:18:25] <%cowardman93> he is so precious
[1:18:29] <LordOfThePoultry> hes rubbing his huge balls all over you
[1:18:30] <bashful_bard> Nearly impossible achievements are always a treat to grind
[1:18:31] <%BoxNavy> paby

[1:31:27] <%AzureGale> What is your opinion on Ape Escape
[1:31:27] <%NovaKnightmare> Maybe its a good think Jak and Daxter isnt made anymore otherwise Druckmann would make a really dumb story for it

[1:31:57] <%BinaryFireball> how dare you do other things
[1:32:01] <Sunstalker> Puzzles, is it puzzles with a death outcome for getting it wrong? Is that what kills you most often, Pat?
[1:32:02] <+RyTYoung> @somesageadvice it's pretty forgettable
[1:32:04] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pat just turned off the stream then turned it on again.

[1:50:30] <+taren817> PUPPER
[1:50:30] <super_robo_mg> its almost like the rich make the rules
[1:50:34] <Sol_Install> @SoFarFetched Oh i'm not suprise if they have some racism going on in there tbh
[1:50:34] <+VariantX7> Randolph and Mortimer are PISSED.
[1:50:37] <Saltmeisterr> OH GOD
[1:50:37] <$Invlux> Apparently hedge fund babies are a protected class now
[1:50:37] <Pookiedaexzile> WE WILL WALLSTREET BET
[1:50:39] <%asgard147> "FEED ME DAD" psaDogchamp
[1:50:39] <%Ranryu692> Well, they apparently call themselves "autistic retards," so getting shut down for hate speech isn't that surprising
[1:50:39] <@SoFarFetched> Discord said "This isn't the first time we've warned wallstreetbets server,this has nothing to do with current events"
[1:50:40] <%Taisuru> G L U T T O N Y
[1:50:40] <+gimmickypizza> They were always the baddies

[1:50:47] <%AzureGale> Odds that gief is going to nab the food out of pat's hjands again
[1:50:47] <SjoeB89> Wallstreetbets was doing gods work in fucking the short-selling billionaires
[1:50:48] <Pookiedaexzile> the DIE HAS BEEN CAST
[1:50:52] <1matheuw> i want to be pure father
[1:50:53] <%SGrim> @kyh9 the only ethical consumption under capitalism is eating the rich.
[1:50:55] <penitentpendant> @kyh9 They're so rare! They're an endangered species that must be protected!
[1:50:56] <+taren817> @PatStaresAt That just makes me think of that one Tiktok about the worm-on-a-strings
[1:50:58] <$Invlux> @SoFarFetched very believable
[1:51:05] <1matheuw> crazy we can still hear it
[1:51:07] <%pokefan9956> let's be real. they don't need reddit to keep doing this
[1:51:17] <@SoFarFetched> Also the reddit went to "invite only"
[1:51:18] <MordiganRomdeau> Elmo's changed, damn

[1:51:51] <Oncogenick> Dogdad
[1:51:56] <@SoFarFetched> I assume this was a people started digging up info about who is behind wallstreet bets.
[1:51:57] <+Rewrench> if there is some regulation coming. at least hope it effects the hedge funds shady deals too
[1:52:03] <Pookiedaexzile> But pig dog first
[1:52:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> i should do that to my dog
[1:52:04] <%TheBensonator_> Giefmo
[1:52:05] <%SGrim> The fact your dog needs special cleaning wipes says a whole lot about the health of the breed.
[1:52:06] <super_robo_mg> wow, what a fun breed of dog to own :/
[1:52:14] <ReRe0183> aww he so cute
[1:52:16] <Oncogenick> FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[1:52:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Honestly not super surprising about the hate speech thing, definitely a lot of edgy "anti-pc" sentiment in that crowd

[1:53:10] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm sure it was the "hatespeech" not the Big money disruption for Wallstreet
[1:53:11] <1matheuw> you forgot to praise him you heartless monster
[1:53:11] <Oncogenick> Gamer zak George
[1:53:12] <+VariantX7> the transaction is complete father.
[1:53:12] <ReRe0183> good boy
[1:53:14] <alroy900> I have a hard time buying the hate speech thing, especially at the same time all other things happended, unless being mean to rich people is hate speech

[1:53:33] <Oncogenick> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[1:53:37] <%Taisuru> @1matheuw He DEFINITELY doesn't care about being praised, just food
[1:54:01] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[1:54:06] <Mr_Rakjo> @PatStaresAt ther eis already a new subreddit
[1:54:09] <%Valdorick> They know NOTHING of modern tech.
[1:54:11] <HeroToxiko> Free time is an infinite range stand
[1:54:13] <%Valdorick> Except its value on the market.
[1:54:15] <Sol_Install> OH THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:54:16] <KaiserMario> yeah, like the platform is problem lol
[1:54:18] <$Afterman_> stop being racist to rich people! :'(
[1:54:19] <%AncelDeLambert> they really think they can put the genie back in the bottle
[1:54:20] <heartlesshealer> what you do is leave them up so you can monitor them LUL
[1:54:26] <$Invlux> They're shitting their pants LUL
[1:54:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> Are you telling me they might be out of touch?
[1:54:27] <penitentpendant> Internet is the realm of SPITE
[1:54:27] <%Agami23> yeah
[1:54:30] <+Rewrench> spite investing? :D
[1:54:30] <%SirGO0SE> theyre going to spite stonk so hard
[1:54:31] <%wibbwobbler> good stuff
[1:54:38] <%Pappajimbo> cant wait for barrierstreet bets the new stranger
[1:54:39] <alroy900> they'll just come back
[1:54:40] <%BoxNavy> rich people are not allowed to cry or be sad
[1:54:42] <1matheuw> eat the rich
[1:54:42] <Sunstalker> I wish Outer Worlds would get a dlc about a planet of stock brokers and shit.
[1:54:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> @alroy900 IDK man, there's always been a lot of f-slurs and such going on in the subreddit
[1:54:55] <+taren817> @Pappajimbo Barrieravenue wagers
[1:54:55] <j___a___c___k___> its hard to understand their bullshit
[1:54:58] <Mr_Rakjo> New Subreddit is live /r/Wallstreetbetsnew/ LUL
[1:54:59] <%DakotaMacDoodle> They just increase there resolve
[1:55:01] <servicesuspension> if your economy can be shook by some memers, it deserves to go down
[1:55:08] <$Afterman_> yeah at least shut down 4chan
[1:55:10] <%caramelatte1> How many times have they tried to shut down 4chan?
[1:55:11] <%debugdrawray_> the hilarious thing is that the2008 deregulation that was lobbied by the hedge fund fucks is part of what enables this
[1:55:12] <HeroToxiko> i think this al stated when rockstar put the stock meme exchange in gtav
[1:55:14] <+Dova573> I have a funny image in my head of Dicaprios character in Wolf of wall street Screaming at a computer about reddit
[1:55:17] <shaddydaddyo> just go to /biz/
[1:55:18] <Sol_Install> much dumber shit on 4chan compare to reddit
[1:55:21] <%Ranryu692> the subreddit even says "like if 4chan found a bloomberg terminal"
[1:55:23] <Kang_Artur> YEAH WELL DO YOU HAVE REAL ESTATE IN EARTH 2?
[1:55:26] <%ClericOfSparda> so apparently CDPR is banning people who use mods to bang Keanu Reeves.
[1:55:26] <j___a___c___k___> like Q ANON
[1:55:27] <%Agami23> like Q
[1:55:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Remember when they got Oprah to say over 9000 penises?
[1:55:41] <%Hiro01231> Somebody explain what we are talking about, because I seem to have missed something
[1:55:43] <ShichiNoBushi> They'll probably try to kill 4chan.
[1:55:47] <+taren817> Wall Street and the Stock Market isn't even a good indication of the economy, it's supposed to show how confident investors and companies are that things will be good enough, hence why it can suddenly plunge at the drop of a hat just because a new Head of State takes office"
[1:55:48] <%BoxNavy> that was good
[1:55:51] <19thperson> I can see the moderators of the subreddit setting it to private on purpose. A huge influx of new users and apparently bots
[1:55:51] <Oncogenick> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:55:52] <servicesuspension> also "I'm 12 and what is this"
[1:55:58] <%Dunmarkh> @Hiro01231 THE ECONOMY
[1:56:05] <%asgard147> GOOD FUCKING LUCK
[1:56:07] <%Taisuru> MAN I HOPE 4CHAN DIES JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
[1:56:07] <%SirGO0SE> it makes them feel like the billions theyve created for themselves wasnt through their brilliance LUL
[1:56:08] <%AzureGale> NO U
[1:56:12] <%Valdorick> Plebs have been planing stuff to fuck over rich assholes without a board in the middle of the town square for MILLENIA
[1:56:16] <Sol_Install> killing 4chan would only spawn something more powerful
[1:56:20] <1matheuw> NO U
[1:56:20] <HeroToxiko> you will make them as million times stronger
[1:56:20] <%Hiro01231> That's not an answer
[1:56:21] <heartlesshealer> Achievement Unlocked: No You
[1:56:21] <SjoeB89> There are so many international chans at this point it would be suicide.
[1:56:28] <%the38bandit> 4chan got a terrorist training camp bombed by russia
[1:56:32] <+Rewrench> @Hiro01231 the reddit place that started the artificail stock rise of gamestop has gotten grief
[1:56:32] <+MugenSandan> how can they possibly take down THE HACKER KNOWN AS 4CHAN
[1:56:33] <%Agami23> that just sparks retaliation
[1:56:35] <%SirGO0SE> whats that? tweet more gazeebos at pat?
[1:56:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> 4chan used contrails, star charts, and frog sounds to pinpoint the location of a flag being livestreamed from the middle of nowhere
[1:56:38] <+RyTYoung> @hiro01231 Wall Street Bets are the guys who managed to bump game stop stocks up and their discord got shut down due to a lot of hate and racial speech
[1:56:38] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:56:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> 4chan cesspool is contained in 4chan. Do not release the filth into the world
[1:56:42] <redrins> and 4chan is a gazebo that has been there forever
[1:56:43] <MordiganRomdeau> it's called resetera
[1:56:44] <servicesuspension> the free market means anyone can snipe you from anywhere else
[1:56:51] <%caramelatte1> Like its the same with trying to stop pirating
[1:56:59] <%Hiro01231> ah
[1:57:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> HOLD HOLD HOLD GME GME GME
[1:57:04] <$Afterman_> correct
[1:57:05] <$Afterman_> that is true
[1:57:05] <SjoeB89> There are so many international chans at this point it would be social suicide.
[1:57:08] <%kyh9> They become quarantine spaces
[1:57:09] <heartlesshealer> ye
[1:57:11] <%NovaKnightmare> its also blatant anti free speech solely because some rich fucks make stupid bets on gamestop stocks
[1:57:12] <%baka_sugoi> true
[1:57:14] <%Blank9> they record everything everywhere and then don't use it anyway
[1:57:17] <$KeroKamina> Twitter has never been the same ever since Tumblr banned horny
[1:57:22] <%asgard147> cos it's easier to investigate that way
[1:57:22] <$Afterman_> instead foi them being fuckin split into 40000 different groups, its just one big place
[1:57:23] <%pokefan9956> shut down the internet to stop wallstreetbets
[1:57:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Diamond Grip of Diamond Hands
[1:57:27] <%Agami23> as if that ever stopped them
[1:57:36] <%Ranryu692> the Capitol riot shows that doesn't work, though lol
[1:57:36] <%Blank9> very good data gathering, not so much data analysis
[1:57:39] <Nordguy> so what you're telling ne 4chan is controlled opposition?
[1:57:47] <+sinistersally> like all those guys on Parler
[1:57:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Tumblr and 4chan need to exist on the internet as crazy magnets
[1:57:53] <Dead_Trickster> No paper hands
[1:57:54] <heartlesshealer> hurty wall
[1:57:54] <+tweedler92> Ludicrous amounts of public planning
[1:57:55] <%NovaKnightmare> And yet the FBI CONSISTENTLY FUCKS UP
[1:57:55] <%the38bandit> what did gme close at today?

With the announcement of next month's PS+ games, I just want urge people not to sleep on Maneater from this month's games. It's a fun shark game narrated by Chris Parnell, and there's even a spin attack that you can pretend is a Giga Drill Break
[2:01:40] <ReRe0183> later pat stream was fun
[2:01:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> What usually happens is shutdowns make groups smaller, but more extreme. In this case, fewer traders will probably be enough
[2:01:46] <+olwe123> we starting or ending?
[2:01:49] <@SoFarFetched> ending
[2:01:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> The subreddit is just invite only because they were getting a ton of brigading and shit and the mods couldn't keep up
[2:01:55] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt play Maneater its super fun

[2:03:29] <+RowenCleric> the stock market seems really stupid
[2:03:29] <ShichiNoBushi> I listened to a podcast not too long ago that talked about that one of the greatest evolutionary advantages of humans is the ability to conceive fiction. Concepts such as nations and money are all completely fictional, but multiple believing in them and valuing them help keep us from killing each other in our crowded communities.
[2:03:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Aeoneth Drugs
[2:03:34] <$Afterman_> next expac u play as emet selch

[2:03:53] <$Invlux> Stocks is astrology for rich people
[2:03:53] <penitentpendant> Cause that's where the villains keep hanging out
[2:03:58] <aeonicvector> I have theories, but I refuse to say them to the unwashed and non-current cause SPOILERS
[2:04:02] <%Monkeyweed21> It will be Garlemald while the Final Days are coming back, maybe some moon @PatStaresAt

[2:04:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Like Vampire, Werewolf, and Mage World of Darkness?
[2:04:36] <+Ipsenscastle> @ShichiNoBushi everyone is LARPing, all the time
[2:05:02] <%AzureGale> Also themes of sad
[2:05:06] <+lethallunacyx> is it though? it felt like playing a ps3 game to me
[2:05:08] <%Valdorick> And its sad music theme.
[2:05:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like theme of sad yakuzies
[2:05:09] <%Monkeyweed21> just like One Piece
[2:05:11] <%baka_sugoi> GREAT
[2:05:12] <@SoFarFetched> only thing I liked of Valhalla is that quest "Smack my Bishop"
[2:05:13] <+RyTYoung> Where as AC Valhalla is like "Hey look funny side quest haha"
[2:05:26] <Sunstalker> I just want the goddamn AC games to have an option when starting a playthrough to HIDE/DISABLE all current day or alien bullshit. üò©

[2:05:36] <%Monkeyweed21> I lovehate that game
[2:05:40] <+TheBitingIrish> I think Yoshi P said in an interview that they would not be making new races in the next expansion @BoxNavy
[2:05:41] <%SirGO0SE> imagine making a game thats fun
[2:05:42] <+RyTYoung> @sofarfetched That, and the pack of fighting Nuns

[2:05:52] <TheHeroAppears> @FallenAngelZelos he said it's a bad rpg
[2:05:55] <%wibbwobbler> nah
[2:06:00] <%BoxNavy> @TheBitingIrish moon2W
[2:06:07] <j___a___c___k___> the yakuza dressed as babies
[2:06:24] <kevamadi> That description is EXACTLY why I can't get into most modern games...
[2:06:24] <penitentpendant> I'd be interested in seeing Sin Eaters fight Demons
[2:06:25] <+Dova573> oh I think whole reddit is down
[2:06:46] <%FallenAngelZelos> @theheroappears and just an ok Yakuza game. He doesnt care for it is the point

[2:07:23] <%Monkeyweed21> cardio
[2:07:24] <penitentpendant> @TheBitingIrish Technically that allows Male Viera and Female Hrothgar. But that is VERY unlikely.

[2:08:32] <%Aeoneth> I thought The Medium was tomorrow
[2:08:39] <+RyTYoung> imma play Hades
[2:08:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, grab Maneater while it's free. It's a good game, but super short
[2:08:46] <penitentpendant> @TheBitingIrish Considering how far they're bending backwards to not have Female Hrothgar in Bozja. It's a low low chance. But it's not 0.
[2:08:57] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Olija comes out tomorrow on steam and so does The Medium
[2:09:07] <%BoxNavy> ;)
