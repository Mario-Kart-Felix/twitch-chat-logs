[0:04:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> I hope pat gives a little rundown on how he felt about the first little nightmares since he beat it off stream

[0:29:37] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:29:37] <Will_The_Soulless> I feel like its probably better that Pat and Paige have a dog instead of a baby because they can get away with making fun of the big dumb baby dog
[0:29:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> yeah
[0:29:38] <%Frost_Quill> Yes, a lot.

[0:30:24] <atteroproxy> Take his hand, return
[0:30:24] <%maenos2> man I can hear gief breathing hard from here
[0:30:28] <%Frost_Quill> Why does Gief hate monkeys so much?
[0:30:35] <%thedankestmeeme> raijin-Maru you can touch his belly if you want
[0:30:40] <%Bailey__gaming> Geif sounds like he is puring
[0:30:41] <%AkronymCLT> Quokkas just smile all the time
[0:30:43] <+gimmickypizza> He's a Godzilla fan
[0:30:48] <+ringabal> Oh no, Pat conditioned his dog to hate Monke's. Now he has to root for Godzilla.
[0:30:50] <%valriot> GOD FUCK
[0:30:55] <%valriot> I FUCKING HATE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
[0:30:55] <iosephe> Rescue them
[0:30:58] <%KineticZen> Fuck those people, also healers who refuse to do damage
[0:31:00] <%AncelDeLambert> IF YOU CAN DO DAMAGE THEN DO DAMAGE
[0:31:01] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab whats up gang, how we doin
[0:31:01] <sydowoodo> he hates monkeys and loves bananas. what's up with that
[0:31:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Frost_Quill Why does the Vatican feel the need to constantly out brainlet themselves??
[0:31:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt todays the 7th anniversary of lighting returns
[0:31:10] <+MoonObscure> and then blame the healer cus we don't heal enough?
[0:31:12] <%lassieme> YUP
[0:31:14] <%valriot> i do that, then they kick me
[0:31:15] <Aydarkzero> ye
[0:31:17] <%Alazull> Word
[0:31:18] <+gimmickypizza> no heals
[0:31:22] <UGD_Greyya> Why should tanks used cds when healers can just heal through the damage?
[0:31:25] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Im healer, i choose who lives and who dies
[0:31:26] <%valriot> yeah
[0:31:27] <%Alazull> Then don't play with them
[0:31:27] <+bunchaghosts> thats actually good
[0:31:29] <%SirGO0SE> GOOD
[0:31:29] <%valriot> YEAH YEHA
[0:31:29] <%abusywizard> no more adlo, only ruin
[0:31:31] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:31:34] <atteroproxy> Sometimes the healers are shit and I have to overuse my CD
[0:31:35] <+MoonObscure> true
[0:31:36] <Frostydough1> what the reasoning behind not using their cd's? i legit dont get it
[0:31:37] <%Alazull> Fuck those guys
[0:31:41] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> healer pass
[0:31:41] <poisin224> KEKW
[0:31:45] <+ringabal> DPS Races don't count if the player's the only one at the start line.
[0:31:46] <+MoonObscure> no
[0:31:46] <%SirGO0SE> no :)
[0:31:47] <TheNewJapanGuy> Spite wins again
[0:31:48] <%lassieme> Truer words have never been said
[0:31:48] <%shurtal> ...what dumbass tanks don't use their cool downs? What the hel?
[0:31:49] <@SoFarFetched> are you talking to yourself Pat?
[0:31:49] <%Puhff> MHMMMM
[0:31:49] <Will_The_Soulless> Honestly that is the best take I think Pat has had
[0:31:49] <$Trenr> My queue is instant! Like I give a fuck if you kick me!
[0:31:50] <+ALazo> queued again and landed with them
[0:31:51] <%lucky_icarus> Holy shit Pat, the fuckers in FF14 who yake any advice as an attack on their person are driving me the fucking wall
[0:31:51] <%baka_sugoi> owo
[0:31:52] <sweetestbeefs> put YOUR dick away pat
[0:31:54] <%Puhff> no
[0:31:54] <%AncelDeLambert> wait are there very actually people who DON'T want extra damage?
[0:31:58] <%Bt_Robot> Paige got her dick out again?
[0:31:58] <Profmcstevie> You negotiate from a position of power as a healer, you don't suffer SHIT
[0:31:58] <%valriot> Seriously though, 6.0 Healers need to NOT be baby sitter factories
[0:32:00] <%Frost_Quill> I used to use all of my defensive cooldowns at once, aaargh I was so bad.
[0:32:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt And so, they were both Healers.
[0:32:04] <%mikessdd> Oh hey it’s pat. Hi Pat
[0:32:05] <%Alazull> Becausse they are FUCKING STUPID
[0:32:07] <ManfredA> People think cooldowns are only for bosses
[0:32:08] <+GTsunamii> fellas is it gay to take less damage
[0:32:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm so confused
[0:32:09] <DianaTheAscian> am I lucky or something cause I never find these people
[0:32:10] <%Solid_Stro> No one Fucks with the white mage lytLURK
[0:32:12] <%ssjklyco> Is it gay to defense buff
[0:32:21] <%spitelite> someone told them to and they refuse to listen to anyone
[0:32:26] <lemonpire> they are DPS at heart
[0:32:32] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert defense cooldowns
[0:32:34] <StencilOST> yummi
[0:32:36] <%AncelDeLambert> competitive games get nasty real fast
[0:32:37] <%Uselesswhitenoise> TEEMO
[0:32:41] <atteroproxy> @Frost_Quill Same, because I was scared of disappointing everyone. Also, I would have shitty gear.
[0:32:41] <%Puhff> TBF it took me awhile to learn to use my CD's on mobs and not just bosses like you do in WoW
[0:32:43] <+lucidrush> Mobers are bad
[0:32:43] <%JumboCrunchies> As a healer main, nothing makes me more upset than a mentor tagged tank that pulls the wall to wall and pops NOTHING.
[0:32:45] <thunka10> the 6 star combo!
[0:32:47] <%Frost_Quill> I have no interest in any MOBA I've ever seen, might change one day but nooooooo for me so far.
[0:32:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @SoFarFetched but... it's another type of heal
[0:32:49] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[0:32:50] <%Uselesswhitenoise> YOU GOTTA GO TOP TEEMO
[0:32:50] <%Arancet> you picked teemo though
[0:32:51] <%KineticZen> Teemo does elicit that reaction
[0:32:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> N word? You mean N00b?
[0:32:53] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:32:56] <%Uselesswhitenoise> GONNA SAY ALL THE SLURS NOW
[0:32:56] <%JumboCrunchies> Why are Mentors always the literal worst players in XIV
[0:32:57] <%abusywizard> @PatStaresAt the one I see a lot is tanks saying "but i'm saving it for the boss" then pull like three groups
[0:32:59] <dinnydanny777> sounds about right
[0:33:01] <Mattais88> Moba's or team CoD?
[0:33:02] <+nikoloas_> you picked teemo so it's kinda deserved in that case
[0:33:02] <%lassieme> the other N
[0:33:02] <%valriot> I love to teach new players, but i HATE people who refuse to learn, and take it as an offence and dont stay in their lane
[0:33:03] <+ringabal> Four in a row?
[0:33:04] <%baka_sugoi> SWEATY
[0:33:04] <%JJCheeker> I always get called a vagina
[0:33:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I used to play Meepo is Dota (AKA Teemo but TEN TIMES MORE ANNOYING) till they nerfed him...
[0:33:09] <Sunstalker> Sounds like Woolie is making bank of selling passes to Lol players
[0:33:12] <ManfredA> FF does have an issue where trying to get rid of dead weight is near impossible, so most people just bail
[0:33:16] <$SGrim> My god, noobtuber?
[0:33:19] <%mikessdd> In my experience the big big toxic in ff14 is sort of separate from the rest of the experience. Unlike WoW where it is entire unavoidable and constant.
[0:33:24] <+D00msDayDan> you don't pay my sub
[0:33:25] <Profmcstevie> Scrubs, people with bad attitudes to learning
[0:33:26] <DianaTheAscian> Its werid cause mobers suck
[0:33:30] <sweetestbeefs> listen, if you pick teemo AT ALL
[0:33:34] <%valriot> The middle content in FFXIV doesnt exist, and it SUCKS
[0:33:35] <%Frost_Quill> Hall of the Novice should be mandatory.
[0:33:39] <sweetestbeefs> it's goin down
[0:33:42] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck off, Teemo is great
[0:33:45] <$drfaustisdead> Cheer1500 Hoping you notice the quality of live Mechanical changes in Little Nightmares 2.
[0:33:46] <SomersaultJustice> pay my subcurrent
[0:33:51] <%AncelDeLambert> gonna support Teemo, you can't stop me
[0:33:54] <ManfredA> Hall of the Novice is also kind of a bad, extremely outdated tutorial
[0:33:55] <%Figleafplays> how would you suggest people looking to get better to get better then? @PatStaresAt
[0:33:55] <%JJCheeker> Whatever I do what I want
[0:33:56] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt If I hear one more BLM say, "No, I don't cast fire spells, I'm an ice mage." I might have an aneurysm
[0:33:56] <%Uselesswhitenoise> team kill that man
[0:33:58] <sweetestbeefs> fuck you, teemo is ass
[0:33:59] <ManfredA> it wouldn't help much
[0:34:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Teemo Support Gang, mushrooms for all
[0:34:06] <olaksi> "please stop wiping the entire raid, here's how" "WHY DON'T YOU CHILL"
[0:34:27] <+MoonObscure> yup
[0:34:32] <%Uselesswhitenoise> no i love to die
[0:34:35] <%Frost_Quill> @Alazull I wish I could switch which one was the damage spell and which was the mp regen spell, because I WANT to be an ice mage.
[0:34:35] <%lassieme> LOL
[0:34:36] <%Alazull> Typically you can help people out, but there's just enough of that attitude around that it can really fucking suck
[0:34:36] <atteroproxy> The most toxic dungeon seems to be Labyrinth of the Ancients for some reason
[0:34:38] <%KineticZen> People are way too touchy
[0:34:43] <rei0> i usually ask first if they want advice lol
[0:34:48] <sweetestbeefs> It's mostly pride @PatStaresAt
[0:34:49] <+vicar_anat> YOUR NOT MY DAD
[0:34:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Less lips more kicks"
[0:34:52] <Profmcstevie> Get out of my multiplayer content person who does not like cooperation
[0:34:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> FailFish
[0:34:54] <%Puhff> THEN Y ARE UYOU DOING IT BAD?!
[0:34:56] <%ssjklyco> "Im sorry, I'll just call you garbage next time instead of helping"
[0:35:00] <mike2hands> the history of human kind
[0:35:07] <SomersaultJustice> thanks coach
[0:35:11] <%Puhff> pride and idiocy
[0:35:17] <%Frost_Quill> @atteroproxy Lots of people lower their item level so they ALWAYS get LotA.
[0:35:20] <+bunchaghosts> set that pride asise
[0:35:21] <%Figleafplays> dude id rather have someone tell me what im doing wrong and get better
[0:35:21] <%Alazull> @Frost_Quill Sure? But that's a lot different then ignoring everything the game teaches you to play bad.
[0:35:22] <%SShen> Help I'm grinding feast for that new sick armour and I want to die
[0:35:22] <%Figleafplays> people suck
[0:35:22] <+MoonObscure> i came back to the game in the lastest update and as soon i joined a dungeon with a friend , i have the other summoner in the group telling me how to play and what material to meld. so yea.
[0:35:26] <ManfredA> 14's big issue like I said is that you just can't kick people who don't learn so people just leave
[0:35:28] <LSether> Often times (at-least in WoW) i find that people often do know what they are supposed to do, but they just cant. They lack the ability but don't want to admit it.
[0:35:29] <Aydarkzero> i think i ran into that issue once in dcuo
[0:35:32] <%KineticZen> Use ACT, but hide your power level
[0:35:33] <sweetestbeefs> Stubbornness and Pride is the fall of a team
[0:35:49] <%valriot> People lack personal responsibility and awareness, both in casual content AND Savage content
[0:35:51] <%ssjklyco> Everyone thinks they are Tom Brady when they are the kid picking his nose writing poetry about their parents
[0:35:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pride has no place in a team? Tell that to every Shounen anime ever.
[0:35:58] <%JumboCrunchies> Pat can you explain why Mentors in XIV are consistently toxic as hell?
[0:35:58] <Profmcstevie> Extreme a, meet Extreme b
[0:36:05] <xeros720> they need to put in some single player duties that people have to pass
[0:36:06] <%Uselesswhitenoise> i hate games trying to ban information
[0:36:06] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but which is worse then?
[0:36:09] <alvaroeltz> Try to be helpful with someone in a league match, and they are happy with it, good luck
[0:36:12] <atteroproxy> @Frost_Quill I would always of LotA a while ago becaue I never cleared any Alliance Raids other than Crystal Tower lol
[0:36:15] <%UvBenServed> Permanently
[0:36:15] <%Figleafplays> BAN EVERYONE
[0:36:16] <%Mr_Pylon> become Ban Ambassador
[0:36:17] <%Figleafplays> :P
[0:36:17] <+RowenCleric> can you get banned for tracking your own dps parse
[0:36:17] <Clanes> I like to be prepared for content, instead of potentially runing it for 10+ people
[0:36:20] <%Bt_Robot> There's an ego with being a tank that makes you think you can take any damage, but you forget that the damage dealt is healing not given elsewhere.
[0:36:22] <sweetestbeefs> PRIIIDE
[0:36:24] <%valriot> YEP LUL
[0:36:24] <%KineticZen> Mentors are the Burger King Kids' Club
[0:36:25] <scrimscromble> ooo a crown
[0:36:26] <%SShen> Crown = I'm better than you mentality
[0:36:28] <%the22cstomp> burger king crown
[0:36:29] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so 99% of players will be banned then
[0:36:29] <%Rock_Fire> Hey Pat, thanks for the entertainment while I wait until medical school match day! Seriously though, getting into med school is jumping through like 5 processes that you have to get selected by and it is pain. Appreciate the entertainment to not stress about that mess though!
[0:36:30] <%KineticZen> It's a dumb little circlejerk
[0:36:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> I would like a crown, plz.
[0:36:34] <+ringabal> @patstaresat Put every one of them on a mandatory Alexander run until they beat it or quit.
[0:36:35] <%valriot> King Shithead
[0:36:36] <%Solid_Stro> Make me GOD psaUp
[0:36:39] <rosemon5001> its more like a crown up their butt @PatStaresAt
[0:36:41] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt It lowers the skill floor just enough to make it so people who aren't good enough to clear content end up in content they can't be dragged through
[0:36:41] <%kyh9> Blue Checkmarks, get fucked
[0:36:41] <UvBenServed> MMMMMMMM, MEEEEE
[0:36:42] <KamikazeKangaro> if i ever fuck up its because i get overwhelmed by all the buttons and flashy moves
[0:36:42] <%Puhff> "You don't pay my sub" mentality is basically what is destroying America right now.
[0:36:46] <ChoculaUltra> since the KH series is coming to the Epic Games Store - do you think we'll see "Pre-order FF7 Remake on the Epic Games Store and unlock Sephiroth in Fortnite early!" kind of things?
[0:36:48] <%KineticZen> I'm a trade mentor but NEVER have it on
[0:36:49] <lemonpire> Oh a little crown you say?
[0:36:50] <%Rock_Fire> Rock_Fire subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat, thanks for the entertainment while I wait until medical school match day! Seriously though, getting into med school is jumping through like 5 processes that you have to get selected by and it is pain. Appreciate the entertainment to not stress ab
[0:36:51] <sweetestbeefs> put a crown on everyone
[0:36:54] <%Ranryu692> cowards
[0:36:56] <+MoonObscure> if only
[0:36:58] <atteroproxy> I turned off titles which makes my life easier
[0:36:59] <%Alazull> Oh damn
[0:36:59] <%MidnightBurst12> hmmmmmmm
[0:37:02] <scrimscromble> oh boy an end goal, better take the fastest route with no regard no anyone else
[0:37:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> it's like, what kind of person would spend every waking hour of their day watching stocks and hedging funds
[0:37:05] <%Frost_Quill> I'm close to being able to be a mentor and I don't know if I actually want to do it because of how toxic they tend to be.
[0:37:05] <dinnydanny777> Kingdom Hearts mini crowns
[0:37:05] <%Alazull> THat's some poignant ass shit

[0:37:16] <+JoeSketchy> Hey Pat, I’ve been going back through God of War now the 60fps 4K update is out. Think you’ll go through it again? The
[0:37:17] <%SShen> I got my crown and turned it off instantly. If they made it something that isn't a crown so it's less appealing you might have more helpful people
[0:37:20] <%SirGO0SE> instead of guns we should give them squeky hammers
[0:37:22] <%Figleafplays> put a crown on everyone then it wont be special.
[0:37:23] <lemonpire> A little crown could give me a god complex i think, as a treat
[0:37:26] <%valriot> WHAT LUL

[0:37:50] <sgt_booyah> Ngl ffxiv’s raiding community is pretty trash
[0:37:50] <@SoFarFetched> cheer500 I was playing the first FFXIV Raid awhile back & a player got pissed off that the new players had no idea how the mechanics work on their FIRST run. He started fucking up later & shutting up afterwards when people were calling him out for making new players feel bad. The rest of the alliance at the end was like "GG everyone EXCEPT for Reggie" (the guy who was yelling)
[0:37:52] <%AncelDeLambert> ...

[0:40:51] <reonome> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.

[0:44:01] <%Frost_Quill> @SoFarFetched I like Aurum Vale if I'm the tank/
[0:44:04] <%Uselesswhitenoise> @PatStaresAt I just had a thought, Did You play the first LN's DLC as well?

[0:44:06] <%Rock_Fire> @PatStaresAt Match Day is the ranking for medical schools based on your applications and interviews Pat. You rank what school you want to attend the most on a list and the schools rank you and you get matched by the primary application service to whatever school you want most and what wants you most. And there's also the rolling admissions process which means you could still get in if you don't get matched in March but it's less likely since you're the alternate for the already filled slots
[0:44:08] <$Trenr> Vale separates the people that know what's going on, from those that are video game illiterate

[0:44:15] <sweetestbeefs> ''supposed to"
[0:44:17] <+xmetalicdemonx> I do because of the anxiety of letting my party members down.
[0:44:18] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Ideally you do, but yeah if you're new and say you're new the party is getting a bonus
[0:44:22] <%Wallabri> I had a 55-minute run of Bardam's the other day cause the tank was new and the healer and other DPS left
[0:44:26] <%CopperTucker> Tanks, for the love of god, ask your healers how big of pulls they want. They appreciate it.
[0:44:31] <%Puhff> @commanderclaw it was actually El Cid and not Calculator that wiped my last Orbonne group

[1:12:38] <Srthunda> this is like a game of the floor is lava except with bear traps
[1:12:39] <%hrbeck_> pine corns
[1:12:39] <Parapattern> Biocurse
[1:12:40] <derekwst3> where is the bears
[1:12:41] <+rottingpastry> Strong Inside vibes
[1:12:47] <%hrbeck_> the sun is a deadly laser
[1:12:48] <thunka10> when day breaks...
[1:12:48] <%chiazam> this place is a goddamn death trap
[1:12:48] <derekwst3> a house
[1:12:52] <%caramelatte1> then an eagle swoops down and takes you away
[1:12:54] <mayor_manders> uh oh
[1:12:54] <ShiningAxis> no way you could see those traps if you were playing on a tv across the room
[1:12:56] <+glassesaregod> Plot twist: There are no more bears in this world. These are kid traps monkaS
[1:12:58] <%chiazam> Moonlight
[1:12:59] <Manwad> haus
[1:13:02] <dinnydanny777> ominous music monkaS
[1:13:02] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Welcome to the family, son.
[1:13:03] <%UvBenServed> Oh good, it's RE7
[1:13:03] <+ringabal> Ah yes, the hunters lodge
[1:13:03] <Laecerelius> Time for creepy house!
[1:13:04] <Diablo169> Big nope
[1:13:04] <f33tykrill187> Forest on a boat
[1:13:06] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ikr?
[1:13:06] <LastnameSilverLastname> Nice to see that the Baker family moved Kappa
[1:13:07] <3viltiki> you go down to the bayou you don't come out
[1:13:08] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt you should knock first
[1:13:10] <ScreamLord> "~Here comes the sun, do do dodoooo~"
[1:13:17] <%chiazam> Why would you go in there
[1:13:17] <LastnameSilverLastname> BAKER FAMILY HOUSE
[1:13:17] <ergulor> RE7
[1:13:18] <deecomposer> what if one of the monsters that chases the player character just looks exactly like pat
[1:13:19] <%bevyrage> oh look at that arm
[1:13:20] <+ringabal> Oh now we're in RE7
[1:13:21] <%Uselesswhitenoise> welcome to the family
[1:13:21] <reonome> ew stinky
[1:13:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt wasn't the first game just on a boat?
[1:13:23] <+TheBitingIrish> WELL TOO LATE NOW
[1:13:24] <LastnameSilverLastname> LET'S GOOOO
[1:13:26] <Aydarkzero> first game took place on a boat right?
[1:13:27] <sydowoodo> re7
[1:13:31] <+Shady_Zaku> here comes the suuuun and I say
[1:13:34] <LastnameSilverLastname> Resi7 now
[1:13:49] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I just imagine a majority of the world is fucked. The comics indicate that horrible monsters abound even in the few nice places @PatStaresAt
[1:13:49] <Midknightsun316> I'm glad I wasn't the only one that thought of re 7 lol
[1:13:53] <Aydarkzero> it's really weird
[1:13:53] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt dont go into a house before knocking, otherwise its rude
[1:13:55] <Jaysky> It's a very strange world
[1:13:57] <DianaTheAscian> freakish
[1:13:59] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yep
[1:14:00] <thunka10> Fairly oddparents proportions
[1:14:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> children are a social construct
[1:14:02] <dinnydanny777> oof that door cuts off your view
[1:14:02] <Laecerelius> Children need more souls to gain more size
[1:14:02] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats rich coming from you @PatStaresAt
[1:14:04] <ergulor> and side games
[1:14:04] <%Uselesswhitenoise> and a phone game with plot elements
[1:14:05] <%Undenizen> i mean, i always figured this is literally a dream
[1:14:05] <%hrbeck_> maybe they are just far away
[1:14:05] <%Alazull> And the skeletons? Are part of it!
[1:14:05] <+archangel9889> I thought the game was metaphor
[1:14:08] <DianaTheAscian> like a foot
[1:14:08] <+TheBitingIrish> There's a mobile game too
[1:14:09] <yeetdabsenpai69> same size as you
[1:14:10] <Louie_Salmon> Canon comics?
[1:14:11] <Jaysky> But it's good that it's strange
[1:14:13] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt There are beast wars comics
[1:14:13] <%chiazam> Is this not a nightmare world that isn't real!?!?!?
[1:14:13] <dinnydanny777> Oh my god that painting
[1:14:15] <Srthunda> I believe that the overall theme of this series is child explotation
[1:14:18] <%SvenHolgersson> "WHY IS THIS CHILD SO SMALL"
[1:14:20] <Parapattern> I thought it was more about spooks than world building
[1:14:22] <%Arancet> heard theyre making a tv show of this too
[1:14:24] <dinnydanny777> Why was that painting so horrible
[1:14:24] <%templar010> oh shit this game
[1:14:25] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I thought you were about the same heigth as those kids when you were a kid Pat...
[1:14:27] <f33tykrill187> All children diet
[1:14:29] <iswearimjustdandy> The comic and app game are canon
[1:14:30] <%0rond> ah yes the house wasn't so spooky let us go to DA BASEMENT
[1:14:32] <%hrbeck_> child wool
[1:14:34] <ergulor> pat got and orb
[1:14:36] <gslayer14> cube > orb

[1:14:52] <sydowoodo> i don't trust that
[1:14:57] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt theres a mobile game called Very Little Nightmares that adds more lore

[1:20:42] <dukenux> Gramma wished to be taxidermied after passing
[1:20:43] <+archangel9889> @PatStaresAt is all this metaphor or is this all real?
[1:20:50] <%templar010> naaisu
[1:20:50] <ergulor> it hit you in the noggin
[1:20:51] <Sotetsu> Teamwork is key
[1:20:52] <derekwst3> companion key
[1:20:59] <dukenux> does this have a coop mode?
[1:21:02] <dinnydanny777> Oh good, they're dolls that's much less creepy Kappa
[1:21:03] <A_CD_By_Thomas> And he keeps the key on his jacket, instead of having to fuckin' carry it
[1:21:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> it's a real analogy
[1:21:06] <Louie_Salmon> Probably gonna be some metaphor later, I would guess
[1:21:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This is real, its not a video game
[1:21:11] <LastnameSilverLastname> These children have great upper body strength man

[1:21:30] <%The_Protagonist> thepro95Heehee
[1:21:32] <Frostydough1> was it hitting its head on the steps while it was going down?
[1:21:35] <ScreamLord> So why are the children so small?
[1:21:35] <KaiserMario> "like" an idiot?
[1:21:38] <triggersqueeze1985> wheres the classic mash a to crank from re4
[1:21:39] <dukenux> The events depicted here are authentic and did actually happen
[1:21:39] <Sotetsu> I never saw how Little Nightmares 1 ended.

[1:22:04] <Dirtboar1> check the bathroom
[1:22:06] <+Meta1spy51> what is that noise
[1:22:07] <%0rond> I think the implication is that what happens at the end of LN1 is that she just mass killed all the adults in the world?
[1:22:10] <%Uselesswhitenoise> @Sotetsu go watch it its the best ending in the world
[1:22:10] <BlueLunecy> That is not Gief making those sounds is it? monkaS

[1:26:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Manwad I really appreciate that the game uses her that way, helps a lot with some parts of the game.
[1:26:23] <T_Sasquatch> Holding handssss oh myyy

[1:36:14] <%RetributionP> did kotor do a dead?
[1:36:15] <%Pappajimbo> DoomGuy says "stay in school and kill all monsters"
[1:36:17] <drfaustisdead> And not time to reflect on the fact that you killed, something.
[1:36:18] <%jyeowa> @G_Thunders they then proceded to break out of said man's house, after all that he's the one to blame LUL

[1:36:22] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @drfaustisdead I honestly just love how much more ambitious II is. I love the first game, but this just blows it outta the park.

[1:36:41] <%JoshManVGH> the real treasure was that gun you found along the way
[1:36:43] <%Alazull> cheer500 I think my best sweaty FF14 story of late was when 5.45 dropped. Did Delubrum Reginae run within 12 hours of the patch dropping, had a guy who just kept sprinting, no ready checks before pulls, even ignoring people needing to afk which caused a wipe at least once. When I asked him to slow it down a bit, he got super hostile and was like, "Well, people should know this shit already!" While it sucks dealing with newbies who refuse to learn, vets who act toxic can eat my whole ass.
[1:36:43] <Ech0Log1ck> porter bridges is about to turn up

[1:40:12] <absentking> THE RAPTURE?
[1:40:15] <trfurkanrey18> !uptime
[1:40:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 40m.
[1:40:18] <%twistedj3ster> this is what happens when you masturbate
[1:40:19] <+G_Thunders> You can run towards the background, like down that street
[1:40:23] <%pectusumbra> Are we going to get some Kill la Kill bullshit in this game? Clothes trying to eat us?
[1:40:25] <A_CD_By_Thomas> The nudist rapture
[1:40:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> not true. they'd be hiding
[1:40:28] <Jaysky> Honey I shrunk the populace
[1:40:32] <%Agami23> i dont know enough about the story of little nightmares to know why your characters are so little
[1:40:34] <auraoftheearth009> Everyone was dusted, and from the dust came amalgamations
[1:40:35] <Srthunda> they might have been turned into gnomes. Or six was here already
[1:40:35] <%SvenHolgersson> IS THIS ONE OF THEM BIBBLE GAMES?!
[1:40:38] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Feels like this might be set after the rapture?
[1:40:42] <triggersqueeze1985> "THAT GUYS A MANIAC WHY DID HE BITE ME?
[1:40:43] <+Veraverse> Smort
[1:40:56] <LastnameSilverLastname> Go back for friend!
[1:40:57] <penitentpendant> Welcome to "TV EVIL" The Game
[1:40:59] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Agami23 It's just a thing with the kids in this universe, don't worry too much about it.
[1:41:03] <dinnydanny777> Oh use the noose to climb up huh
[1:41:04] <atteroproxy> Rule of threeeeees
[1:41:11] <%misha_kastrilevich> I didn't know this game took place in Laval
[1:41:13] <%Puhff> no bibbles here bois
[1:41:15] <+unhuggable1> yo
[1:41:20] <ergulor> This co op puzzles are great
[1:41:23] <Louie_Salmon> It doesn't?
[1:41:23] <%BinaryFireball> oh it doesnt
[1:41:26] <ergulor> These
[1:41:27] <drfaustisdead> Your AI partner feels real good.
[1:41:28] <+derg0ns> That's what I though
[1:41:29] <%BinaryFireball> theres 2
[1:41:29] <reonome> it doesn't??
[1:41:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I think they considered it, but it clashed too much with what they were going for.
[1:41:34] <%chiazam> Does it not!?!?!?
[1:41:35] <+GTsunamii> it does give off portal 2 vibes strangely
[1:41:37] <+spuginky> co-op would be a nightmare
[1:41:38] <%BinaryFireball> i was like where be paige?
[1:41:39] <Parapattern> Nothing is more endearing than a good AI in a partner
[1:41:41] <Louie_Salmon> Literally until this exact moment I thought it did
[1:41:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> i saw that glitch
[1:41:49] <%bevyrage> anyone legit have the feeling that you're gonna have a moment of BETRAYAL with this?
[1:41:49] <Goodvibes99508> wouldn't that make the game uncompleteable
[1:41:55] <%BinaryFireball> coop shadow puzzles would be excellent
[1:41:56] <auraoftheearth009> I'm going to laugh if the buddy is actually leading you to your doom

[1:42:06] <%bhp_99> maybe for dlc or another sequel they'll put some in
[1:42:07] <majindusto> Little Nightmares "2"
[1:42:08] <RetributionP> yeah I'm not feeling this game sadly
[1:42:11] <penitentpendant> Single Player Co Op puzzles, with an invincible allied NPC who does everything right. So immediately more reliable than actual co op.
[1:42:12] <%n0tanaxemurderer> Touch fuzzy get dizzy

[1:42:31] <%bevyrage> OH NO

[3:17:28] <+DoobieDancer> Breaking its fingers like an actual psychopath
[3:17:28] <%hrbeck_> ya winning, six?
[3:17:30] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt evidence?
[3:17:30] <3viltiki> did she just make that hand throw up the horns?

[3:17:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> The Prince of all Cosmos has seen better days
[3:17:32] <sweetestbeefs> oh shit she was breaking the hand
[3:17:33] <mrblack499> other games today?
[3:17:34] <derekwst3> its a pre sequel
[3:17:36] <%Uselesswhitenoise> she is very very mad
[3:17:36] <+Allenora> 6 woulda ate that hand
[3:17:37] <%Undenizen> Six is the protagonist of her own game
[3:17:37] <Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat is Six getting Taller?
[3:17:38] <+Walopoh> I REALLY hope it is a sequel, Six needs redemption
[3:17:38] <+223remmy> uh, is that a friend?
[3:17:38] <BerryliciousDefinition> I think she was breaking the fingers
[3:17:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> As long as she takes out her violent tendencies on manequins.
[3:17:42] <%Blackleafx> I mean
[3:17:43] <%TheFramedWarlock> What happened in the last game ?
[3:17:45] <%Blackleafx> she kinda did
[3:17:45] <jamox1> She’s just sitting there... MENACINGLY
[3:17:46] <%pectusumbra> was she breaking them or trying to eat them?
[3:17:49] <DianaTheAscian> true
[3:17:50] <Ech0Log1ck> Less likely she would lose then find her raincoat than that this would be just where she found it
[3:17:50] <tolloponik> can't eat you
[3:17:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Notice how you only get attacked when Six isn't around @PatStaresAt
[3:17:50] <Parapattern> Anyone can wear a raincoat tho
[3:17:51] <reonome> I mean...
[3:17:52] <%Dunmarkh> is that why it's called litttle nightmares 2?
[3:17:55] <%bleugh> presequelquel
[3:17:57] <drfaustisdead> Breaking.
[3:17:57] <$CommanderSqueaks> @pectusumbra Breaking
[3:17:59] <+Allenora> I think the game littlest nightmares is the prequel
[3:18:01] <%Blackleafx> @TheFramedWarlock 6 essentially killed everything
[3:18:03] <%hrbeck_> @CommanderSqueaks like a normal person
[3:18:07] <%hopendreamlesss> She hugged that gnome, remember?
[3:18:07] <%bevyrage> ignoring the first guy
[3:18:07] <Sol_Install> no the teacher
[3:18:10] <sweetestbeefs> six is the final boss
[3:18:10] <Meekest> The Hunter attacked you too
[3:18:11] <Agami23> no, you got attacked by a doll and the giants
[3:18:12] <+asgard147> that's not true
[3:18:12] <+invader_rin> The kid dolls
[3:18:12] <Blackleafx> and the teacher
[3:18:14] <%twistedj3ster> and the hunter
[3:18:14] <drfaustisdead> The trapper attacked too.
[3:18:15] <+Walopoh> The snake lady
[3:18:15] <DianaTheAscian> not true
[3:18:15] <Aydarkzero> but now she has her raincoat
[3:18:16] <%UnabashedGarbage> Also by the neck lady
[3:18:16] <Darthkitten_Prime> And the hunter
[3:18:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> And the Teacher
[3:18:16] <%CalderGaming> the hunter also shot at both of you
[3:18:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> They loooove each other
[3:18:16] <%Taisuru> And the Hunter
[3:18:16] <reonome> one guy
[3:18:17] <heartlesshealer> Lady head
[3:18:19] <%Frost_Quill> Hunter too.
[3:18:19] <%EmptyPenguin> and the long neck lady
[3:18:20] <%SirGO0SE> maybe you're Seven..which means..you ate Nine monkaS
[3:18:21] <+invader_rin> The hunter too
[3:18:21] <%DakotaMacDoodle> and the Hunter
[3:18:23] <sweetestbeefs> no, they surprised you and took her away
[3:18:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also the teacher
[3:18:24] <%Agami23> and the hunter
[3:18:24] <olaksi> super not accurate
[3:18:24] <devanmuse> And the hunter, and the teacher
[3:18:24] <SomeAsianDood> and the hunter
[3:18:24] <%bevyrage> yeah six was around during each major encounter at some point
[3:18:25] <+ALazo> didn't the giraffe woman chase both of you
[3:18:25] <malamepos> the hunter?
[3:18:25] <%Taisuru> Not even slightly true lol
[3:18:28] <Darthkitten_Prime> That would be really cool though
[3:18:28] <%Frost_Quill> AND the teacher.
[3:18:28] <Sol_Install> the hunter, the teacher, the dolls
[3:18:29] <Ech0Log1ck> would be really funny if she had her sould consuming darkness powers but just wasn't using them
[3:18:31] <%jinking79> fuck this room
[3:18:32] <malamepos> and da lady
[3:18:36] <KaiserMario> And the Librarian

[3:21:37] <%bevyrage> okay so i've thought back on the previous encounters: the times you're getting chased 6 isn't targeted by their attacks, and you're always trailing behind them.

[3:21:57] <%hopendreamlesss> Somehow, these things suck even worse than mannequins.

[4:03:23] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt that's because your house doesn't have sufficient eyeglasses lol
[4:03:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just use car keys peach, that's what I use to open most of my boxes

[4:03:25] <%SaiyanShoto> Is she opening her box full of furry stuff

[5:17:46] <a_mad_dragon_> pink isn't a colour, the government made it up
[5:17:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> How is the color not real? How can we see it??
[5:17:49] <%voidthieff> what does that even mean
[5:17:49] <penitentpendant> Ah, a familiar tune
[5:17:50] <Srthunda> its the song they hum
[5:17:50] <ミュウレ4242> TurtlesAndTentacles, frontier psychiatry!
[5:17:55] <$Cozy90> THAT IS A FUCKIN BLUE SPACE CAT
[5:17:56] <+marusean_> JINKIES
[5:17:58] <%Uselesswhitenoise> THE MUSIC
[5:17:58] <%Undenizen> oh it's a sound puzzle
[5:17:59] <%pokefan9956> I keep thinking of dio pushing polnareff down the stairs
[5:18:02] <%chiazam> No Pat
[5:18:08] <+Catpurnicus> look at that melted file cabinet
[5:18:08] <%TheWinged7> your looping
[5:18:08] <%logoth_> The same color of the gamecube
[5:18:09] <Psyramics> its cause that wavelength of light doesnt exist
[5:18:11] <jorniev> THE COLOR FROM SPACE!?
[5:18:12] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, NO purple is real if you're gonna go that route
[5:18:13] <+Shady_Zaku> MC Escher shit
[5:18:13] <penitentpendant> Octarine?
[5:18:14] <%wibbwobbler> lmao
[5:18:15] <heartlesshealer> it has to do with our eyes being crap
[5:18:15] <%Bt_Robot> HALLWAY
[5:18:15] <%TheWinged7> getting Dio-ed
[5:18:16] <%hq_residential_house> the nick cage color
[5:18:17] <%Broand> It's interlaced blue and red, but our eyes see it as purple
[5:18:17] <%Maids4lyfe> Magenta isn't a real color
[5:18:19] <minty_con> ....
[5:18:20] <ammobasket> red and violet are at different ends opf visual light
[5:18:21] <%Uselesswhitenoise> WALK TOWARDS MUSIC
[5:18:22] <%voidthieff> how can mirrors be real if our eyes arent real
[5:18:23] <%Gogogolem> Just cause we cna't see it doesn't mean its not real.
[5:18:25] <%donkymagooterson> the color of brain farts
[5:18:26] <+Danpai_> Hell yeah, impossible space? You love to see it
[5:18:27] <%Agami23> no color is real
[5:18:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @mule4242 PRAY FOR TENTACLES
[5:18:28] <+geistuser> Follow music
[5:18:29] <Meekest> He'll figure it out
[5:18:30] <%baka_sugoi> its not the BRIGHTEST PINK

[5:18:32] <ミュウレ4242> pink is also not real. it's a fantasy color that empowers magical girls.
[5:18:33] <%VStan11> The Colour of Magic
[5:18:34] <pebblypirate> Its called minus-green
[5:18:34] <sweetestbeefs> KEEP WALKING INTO THAT DOOR
[5:18:35] <+Seitine> Color is just the reflection of light.
[5:18:36] <%arcielardor> go through the doors where the music is louder
[5:18:36] <Profmcstevie> There's no wavelength of light that corresponds to that particular color. it's a construct of our brain of a color that is a combination of blue and red
[5:18:37] <%chiazam> Yeah this can't be right
[5:18:39] <jorniev> ITS ONE OF THOSE PUZZLES
[5:18:40] <%KineticZen> Will he though
[5:18:40] <%Undenizen> It's not real because it doesn't appear on a natural spectrum. We see it because of our inability to interpolate some shades together.
[5:18:42] <samuelfisk> That’s why the director chose it for the movie.
[5:18:46] <%Hiro01231> He won't figure out a music puzzle
[5:18:46] <+Catpurnicus> keep going through the same way
[5:18:50] <%Alazull> The Color out of Space exists on a frequency that drives people mad

[5:25:48] <Anibaruthecat> doesn't suppose Six has eldritch god powers? why she don't use them? all the game was pretty defenseless
[5:25:52] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I think it's just an afterimage when he calls out.

[5:40:23] <%Foxsploder> You gotta
[5:40:24] <haitakaa> unfortunately bull dogs can have breathing issues
[5:40:26] <theanora1> did you think this was worth $30?
[5:40:28] <%Dakuu75> So it's just intentionally vague-as-fuck. I see. Damn...
[5:40:28] <A_CD_By_Thomas> They all did an awesome job.
[5:40:30] <+CptBritches> STANK ASS DOOG
[5:40:31] <Doomstar16> What does he smell like?
[5:40:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Uh OH STINKY
[5:40:32] <%hq_residential_house> the dog has become smelly
[5:40:34] <%jdhwash> sleepy bebeee
[5:40:35] <%mikessdd> I doubt dlc for this game will clear things up. They didn’t do much for the first game. Besides solidify the horrific nature of 6’s actions.
[5:40:35] <Sundaysmiles01> sleep fartin
[5:40:38] <xeros720> have you guys washed Gief yet?
[5:40:40] <%Blackleafx> We'll probably get a DLC like the 1st game that shines a bit more light on it. Or supplementary comics again. Overall all of this is really ambigious but I still think its neat.
[5:40:41] <majindusto> Oh oh, Stinky
[5:40:45] <Profmcstevie> Maybe she saw evil in him as the hat man, dropped him and inadvertently made him the hat man
[5:40:49] <%ionic_atom> ionic_atom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! luv u
[5:41:00] <Sundaysmiles01> I wanna know the deep lore of this world

[5:41:13] <%Dakuu75> ^
[5:41:15] <%Monkeyweed21> He turned into a gamer girl
[5:41:15] <%chiazam> This seems like a really fun game, but its story elements makes fuck all sense to me
[5:41:16] <+Katohearts> @PatStaresAt , there's nothing after this
[5:41:19] <+Allenora> maybe she was made because he broke her music box
[5:41:19] <$Cozy90> gief has my reaction
[5:41:21] <%jdhwash> vati vidya
[5:41:22] <mak0t0yukii> Faster

[5:41:29] <casualbaloth> there's nothing
[5:41:29] <%Agami23> like inside?
[5:41:30] <+Katohearts> Ok
[5:41:32] <casualbaloth> just watch the youtube
[5:41:33] <%pectusumbra> So I feel like this is setting up by the third game Six will just be The Villain you will have to kill
[5:41:35] <%hrbeck_> no, "deep lore" just makes it suck. be vague
[5:41:39] <penitentpendant> Read donations while you wait?
[5:41:41] <thunka10> Customer service? In the credits?
[5:41:42] <+Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I don't think there's much to "explain" for Little Nightmares, in that there's hidden lore. The setting is just horrific.
[5:41:43] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt put a car tree on his butt so when he farts it smells like car...
[5:41:43] <+marusean_> Little Nightmares 2 Ending EXPLAINED (shocking)
[5:41:51] <%jdhwash> bando namcai
[5:41:52] <%SvenHolgersson> what happened
[5:41:52] <+CptBritches> If you didn't get the collectibles then I think it just puts you back on the menu
[5:41:53] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Sundaysmiles01 There's a lotta great themes about growing up and whatnot that I think can be read into it, it's a super great series. I recommend the comics and the mobile game if you haven't checked 'em out.
[5:41:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Tell me
[5:41:56] <heartlesshealer> Remember when elmo climbed into the toilet and then ran around the old apartment? Fun times

[5:43:17] <+Seitine> So is there an evil version?
[5:43:17] <derekwst3> Mufasa
[5:43:17] <%bevyrage> that's a picture of THE MAW
[5:43:18] <+Katohearts> Six sees Shadow Six and a flyer for the MAW, the location of the first game. Then her stomach rumbles.
[5:43:18] <%Blackleafx> HUNGY
[5:43:21] <%Blackleafx> SHE HUNGY
[5:43:24] <+allups> it is a prequel
[5:43:25] <jorniev> IT WAS SHADOW 6
[5:43:26] <Dirtboar1> IT IS A PREQUEL
[5:43:27] <%wibbwobbler> oh wow

[5:43:29] <%asgard147> HUNGER
[5:43:31] <%bevyrage> it can't be a prequel because she's got the hunger and the memory of her mom's music box
[5:43:32] <%kewlmyc> BIG HUNGRY
[5:43:33] <%chiazam> IS ITTTT!?!?
[5:43:34] <%Arancet> I love when stories have a deep lore but are cryptic and careful with dispensing it, and hate when they just throw out random bullshit that looks cryptic but has no meaning behind it. It can be a line line between them. And I can't tell which this is.
[5:43:35] <%whyskeywolfe> Man, fuck this bitch.
[5:43:35] <+marusean_> fuck you six thats what you get
[5:43:37] <leto_ii_muadibadder> cmonBruh
[5:43:37] <%pectusumbra> That was her stomach.
[5:43:37] <+Allenora> She didn't want to eat him?
[5:43:37] <mak0t0yukii> THE HUNGER
[5:43:39] <+AXL808> she was always a bitch
[5:43:39] <+invader_rin> She might have eaten Mono
[5:43:41] <sweetestbeefs> wait so it IS a prequel????
[5:43:41] <majindusto> IT WAS A PEQUEL LOL
[5:43:41] <Jaysky> Did she drop him so she wouldn't eat him?
[5:43:45] <Pixelrida> It's a trailer for Tekken 8
[5:43:46] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! after a bunch of bad luck with timing of fate pops, I finally got the Ixion mount in FF14. Now back to losing my mind grinding for relic weapon
[5:43:48] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oh, she was going to eat him if she helped him up
[5:43:48] <+allups> are the little people in thgis one also
[5:43:49] <Draco_Renegade> Did you see the tall man as her shadow?
[5:43:50] <%Frost_Quill> So did she betray the main character or did she let him go so she wouldn't eat him???
[5:43:51] <%mikessdd> Grumbling stomach and an add for the Maw. It’s totally a prequel
[5:43:51] <jorniev> SHADOW CHILDREN
[5:43:53] <Sundaysmiles01> and then she ate people, The End
[5:43:54] <sweetestbeefs> THATS STUPID
[5:43:55] <+CptBritches> I thought the devs said it was a sequel?
[5:43:57] <%hq_residential_house> we were the prequel the whole time
[5:43:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> snoaaaaaar
[5:44:00] <$Cozy90> the ending disappointed me abit

[5:44:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> thoughts?
[5:44:16] <+chocoborb> \O/
[5:44:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Hmmm.
[5:44:18] <%logoth_> TIME LOOP
[5:44:21] <Profmcstevie> Sounds like lying
[5:44:21] <Meekest> She didnt stop being hungry
[5:44:22] <%LonePlus_> THE MAW 2
[5:44:22] <%baka_sugoi> TIME LOOPS
[5:44:23] <%jdhwash> time is an endless circle bullshit
[5:44:24] <+Shady_Zaku> but it's a sequel....? fml
[5:44:24] <%Livelinne> PrideShrug
[5:44:24] <%hq_residential_house> nothing makes any sense
[5:44:25] <+CharredChord> lol wat
[5:44:25] <%Agami23> time loop?
[5:44:26] <Sundaysmiles01> its a sequel prequel
[5:44:26] <%SvenHolgersson> SHE HAS THE GOOD POWER
[5:44:27] <sweetestbeefs> does she hunger again?
[5:44:28] <jorniev> OH THATS ZANGIEF MAKING NOISES
[5:44:28] <shamefulbowsettefolder> I’m glad I’m just getting here then
[5:44:30] <%SvenHolgersson> SHE WANTS ALL GOD POWER
[5:44:30] <%twistedj3ster> Well, time to delete that off my switch
[5:44:31] <%Ranryu692> maybe the true ending will explain?
[5:44:31] <+Seitine> Missed these kinda streams fuck yeah. ❤️
[5:44:32] <%TheWinged7> time is not a line, time is a circle
[5:44:32] <%ssjklyco> It's a prequel sequel
[5:44:32] <iswearimjustdandy> Time loop
[5:44:32] <thunka10> 2 Protag gets revenge in 3?
[5:44:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hate time loops
[5:44:33] <Dirtboar1> another taste
[5:44:34] <+chocoborb> time loops?
[5:44:34] <%Livelinne> HOW
[5:44:34] <Matt_Cowdery> When there's time travel a sequel can be a prequel
[5:44:37] <%bevyrage> showing THE MAW is a reminder of the hunger, and it makes sense she would drop you if she doesn't want to eat you
[5:44:38] <%hrbeck_> lets go to the maw, today
[5:44:38] <%mikessdd> Yeah it’s like. Oh so we going back? That’s dumb.

[5:45:14] <heartlesshealer> dogs are important, yet
[5:45:18] <%Nomad_Scholar> However, if the player finds all of the Glitching Remains, a secret cutscene implies that Six betrayed Mono not out of selfishness, but rather to save him. After emerging from outside of the TV, a Glitching Remain of Six appears and her stomach rumbles, implying her hunger had awakened.
[5:45:23] <heartlesshealer> yes*

[5:51:10] <shamefulbowsettefolder> WutFace
[5:51:11] <%MisterRockett> Mustard does go on hotdogs, yes.
[5:51:11] <%LonePlus_> 105 oz bro
[5:51:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a large variety of mustard
[5:51:15] <%BinaryFireball> FROTHY MUSTART TIME?
[5:51:15] <blue8moon> I don't even like mustard
[5:51:15] <ammobasket> and chicken dip
[5:51:16] <%walternatorz> pat, you're a hot dog.
[5:51:17] <%AgniBrandt> Nah man you can do some crazy shit with mustard. Especially whole grain mustard
[5:51:20] <%Alazull> Smoked meat with some mustard is nice
[5:51:23] <leovaldezking> we dont know how to deal wit dat shit
[5:51:23] <%RetroCop87> it's good mixed with mayo on a steak and cheese
[5:51:24] <%miguelrod777> coward
[5:51:25] <%AgniBrandt> Makes for a great pan sauce
[5:51:26] <%kewlmyc> I use it in my fried fish recipes
[5:51:27] <%hq_residential_house> stoneground mustard is pretty sick ngl
[5:51:27] <%Ranryu692> there is a reasonable middle ground between Pat and Paige when it comes to mustard
[5:51:30] <%wibbwobbler> whoah man that's great
[5:51:33] <majindusto> Honey Mustard and Chicken Nuggets tho
[5:51:35] <ChocolateMoofin> i get it in my burger king by accident a lot and it gets..easier to stand mustard each time
[5:51:44] <@SoFarFetched> not the xenogears OST?
[5:51:44] <%MisterRockett> Honestly I'm almost inclined to agree with that I only use Mustard on hotdogs and sandwiches.
[5:51:45] <%Daxalog> Same!

[5:53:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Rick, that’s true
[5:53:02] <+TheotherKristian> Nah, it's just you
[5:53:02] <heartlesshealer> Music SNOBS are the worst
[5:53:07] <%whyskeywolfe> Music gatekeeping is universal.
[5:53:10] <%Breaknoon> Dammit i missed the stream ;_;
[5:53:10] <+twohitgood> elitists are shit
[5:53:11] <%Deft_Thought> What fandom doesn't have that?
[5:53:12] <ChocolateMoofin> Suddenly, HIPSTERS!
[5:53:13] <%Alazull> Music fans will absolutely be like, "Oh, you only know that because it was in..." Fuck them, I like it because I heard it somewhere and I like it
[5:53:14] <majindusto> WOW
[5:53:15] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Metallica bad
[5:53:17] <+Justin_k_killed_a_woman> That applies to all opinions thouigh, especially on the internet.
[5:53:21] <%LeiaSkynoober> She likes select artists, but for someone who loves rhythm games, she doesn't like music
[5:53:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Music fans gatekeep like crazy
[5:53:25] <lonefirewarrior> Rock and metal fans in particular are the worst
[5:53:26] <penitentpendant> Music, it's food for the ears. People get possessive about it.
[5:53:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Rick? That was supposed to say fuck.
[5:53:30] <Ephexos101> its pretty good
[5:53:33] <%pokefan9956> literally anything other than country is valid
[5:53:33] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Ken Ashcorp is pretty cool

[5:53:45] <+LordSDB> YE Ken Ashcorp! woolieCHAN
[5:53:45] <%Nekros4442> I legit just listen to Hololive songs now.....
[5:53:46] <%Breaknoon> i just tell people i listen to "guitar music" mostly
[5:53:47] <%KineticZen> David Byrne's How Music Works is an interesting read
[5:53:48] <Louie_Salmon> Okay but norwegian power metal is pretty cool
[5:53:49] <heartlesshealer> "Oh, you like big band music? That's dumb and old"
[5:53:51] <%maenos2> fuck yeah kenny
[5:53:54] <%DakotaMacDoodle> If it feels good to hear listen to it, everyone can go fuck off
[5:53:56] <%Deft_Thought> That's damn near every fandom. Posturing is every fucking place
[5:53:59] <%Cozy90> Cozy90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Pat its ok. I hate fans of almost ANYTHING. Especially any video game that has competitive multiplayer.
[5:53:59] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Let pat listen to the songs he like
[5:54:02] <DrStinkers> yo that romanian scrunge metal though
[5:54:03] <+twohitgood> i remember ken ashcorp for the tasteless tribute song.
[5:54:07] <sougoe> Music fans will argue all day about just categorizing music
[5:54:10] <%Agami23> spotify has a radio feature where you can make a playlist of music based on any song. doing that with ken ashcorp is pretty fun
[5:54:11] <ChocolateMoofin> My roommate gave me shit for listening to "emo" music for a few days but blasts KPop relentlessly without me saying anything.
[5:54:12] <%hq_residential_house> if you listen exclusively to instrumental music, no one will ever bother you about it - true story
[5:54:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> OC Remix is pretty dope
[5:54:17] <%ChungusQuest> hell yeah they do!
[5:54:18] <raveous> OCRemix the GOAT
[5:54:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> I listen to like three songs from the 1990s and The Wellerman.
[5:54:20] <%Breaknoon> Megamna remixes son
[5:54:23] <+Justin_k_killed_a_woman> OCR was pretty good for what it was.
[5:54:23] <%BinaryFireball> talking about music is like talking about the balls you dont have
[5:54:28] <%Agami23> siivagunner might be memey but he also does some good music
[5:54:28] <%RetroCop87> Triple-Q tho
[5:54:43] <%YakumoYomi> Good times. I remember all the sick Chrono Trigger and Megaman remixes on OC Remixes
[5:54:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> I just had a reading for class arguing that Hungarian punk rockers helped lead to the Hungarian revolution and I wanted to die
[5:54:46] <%pokefan9956> silvagunner is fantastic

[5:55:50] <%RetroCop87> Not gonna lie, the soundtrack for Fairy Tail is some banging scottish rock
[5:55:51] <%Ynkubus_> Something something Little Busters~!
[5:55:52] <%YakumoYomi> @Breaknoon The only BDM song I know is What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse
[5:55:57] <%Alazull> RIDE ON SHOOTING STAR

[5:55:58] <%wibbwobbler> the pillows bro ah man bro
[5:56:00] <%gitgouda> thats gonna be stuck in my head now
[5:56:01] <%JoshManVGH> Japanese rock has such a distinct sound through all of it and I can't describe it. Like the guitar riffs sound so different to western rock.
[5:56:02] <%linSP> you know what i have stuck in my head, that fuckin "LEON!!" video
[5:56:03] <%Breaknoon> YESSS
[5:56:06] <%Daxalog> "What? Arent you internalizing the lyrics to these songs?" It just s a cool song sir. It soudns cool.
[5:56:06] <%YakumoYomi> The Pillows are great
[5:56:08] <devil_ahhhhhh> remember nightcore
[5:56:09] <%necrocannibal2> TBDM is the shit
[5:56:10] <%Broand> There's a manga which is like 30% referencing that soundtrack
[5:56:11] <%Breaknoon> That's the song that got me into them

[5:56:24] <%Broand> Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is good
[5:56:26] <ChocolateMoofin> But I try to keep the "GIRLS BEER TRUCKS AMERICA" country away from me. True Farm Emo country is best

[5:56:41] <+Dova573> Unless is a game with no or bad music
[5:56:41] <%necrocannibal2> that's weird
[5:56:42] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[5:56:45] <%gitgouda> @Broand did that ever get an anime?
[5:56:45] <%YakumoYomi> Last Dinosaur is my favorite FLCL song
[5:56:45] <%Cozy90> last dinosaur by the pillows gets me in the feels
[5:56:47] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Explain
[5:56:50] <%Breaknoon> BRUH tbdm doesnt have a single album that i think sucks. Shit is great.
[5:56:53] <%Daxalog> I knew a guy who did that for Xbox games ALL the time back in the day.
[5:56:54] <%necrocannibal2> it's like those weirdos that watch things at 1.5x speed
[5:56:56] <%Cozy90> @YakumoYomi YES
[5:56:58] <heartlesshealer> I do remember most of Blues Drive Monster though
[5:57:02] <%mikessdd> Oh sick. Joseph Anderson is good.
[5:57:02] <Mattais88> I do that grinding out RPGS
[5:57:05] <+Dova573> they were probaly playing MK
[5:57:07] <%Alazull> Imagine turning off the Guilty Gear soundtrack
[5:57:08] <+Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It can get legitimately distracting from what you're playing.
[5:57:12] <%Ranryu692> nah, in multiplayer games it's fine
[5:57:13] <%Breaknoon> gotta listen to music while grinding out training mode or in RPGs
[5:57:16] <heartlesshealer> but Subhuman sticks in my head the most aside from Ride On Shooting Star
[5:57:17] <%necrocannibal2> it's great for grinding tho
[5:57:20] <sylvainsilver> Did i miss the game?
[5:57:20] <SomersaultJustice> FF music during fighting games is pretty neat
[5:57:21] <%baka_sugoi> AROUND THE WORLD

[5:57:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I put on Podcasts while I grind.
[5:57:50] <%Puhff> Justice is 2 guys
[5:57:51] <%Cozy90> i am justice
[5:57:52] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I've seen people play generic EDM music during their first story run of FF14 trials and it's MADDENING. IMAGINE PLAYING THAT OVER SOS INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL MUSIC
[5:58:00] <ammobasket> Everyone check out Justice
[5:58:07] <+Katohearts> Beep boops?

[5:58:27] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Oh pat
[5:58:31] <%Alazull> Justice is definitely hard on the electronic sound
[5:58:45] <%JoshManVGH> Wikipedia has the list
[5:58:45] <%Cozy90> POP Culture is AWESOME
[5:58:45] <+Dova573> The only game I had a music playlist was league and thats cause league had no music
[5:58:46] <heartlesshealer> @Dapper_Cactuar how could anyone cover up the big field enemy music like when fighting the crabs? D:
[5:58:46] <%Daxalog> I played frets on fire and then i learnt that i too can like music
[5:58:47] <%Alazull> But fucking DVNO slaps, as do a couple of their other songs

[6:00:03] <+Seitine> No we had a horse girl though.
[6:00:03] <%KineticZen> The trick is to not care about Twitter, because it's stupid

[6:00:52] <+Seitine> Ska is shit.
[6:00:52] <BigNerdSam> Ska died when Tony Hawk lost his identity.
[6:00:53] <%moondog_> BUT SKA CAME BOFORE REGGAE THO
[6:00:56] <ravioli_ronin> *trombone fires out bearded dragons*

[6:01:08] <%MisterRockett> @cvp5127 LIFE GOES ON EVERYTHING GOES COMING UP OOO
[6:01:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I learned to play trombone cause I was into a girl who was into ska
[6:01:09] <%Alazull> Technically?
[6:01:10] <%baronblank> never been to a ska concert but it's got some good stuff, get the impression some of the fans are a little out there though
[6:01:12] <Mattais88> The Ska band in my highschool was all guys from the Jazz Band
[6:01:13] <%BinaryFireball> ska has been around forevvvvveerr
[6:01:15] <%necrocannibal2> @Breaknoon Revenant by Inferi

[6:01:20] <+Seitine> A garbage fire.
[6:01:24] <%SvenHolgersson> Ska is oldddddddddddddddddddd
[6:01:24] <%Cozy90> Ska came before reggae. - Elyse from funhaus
[6:01:26] <heartlesshealer> might have been timing of popularization
[6:01:26] <+dee_zoe> ska and reggae are both from jamiaca
[6:01:26] <%Ranryu692> ska is fine, but people for whom ska is their identity are the worst
[6:01:27] <%baka_sugoi> vibe
[6:01:29] <Mattais88> Dem steel drums
[6:01:30] <%wibbwobbler> yea lol
[6:01:32] <%ChungusQuest> @Dova573 there was a huge Ska revival around when people now in their mid-30s were in high school. It was VERY polarizing.
[6:01:32] <+dee_zoe> i like ska :c
[6:01:36] <ravioli_ronin> Ska is the only music you can smell
[6:01:37] <%RetroCop87> Regea is pleasant background tunes
[6:01:37] <%necrocannibal2> @Breaknoon great melodeath band. Trevor actually cameos in one of the songs.
[6:01:38] <globehead666> there are three distinct phases of ska. they differ greatly
[6:01:38] <+Seitine> It’s vibin’
[6:01:42] <%moondog_> ahh the funhaus degens come out
[6:01:43] <ravioli_ronin> And it smells bad
[6:01:43] <+Catpurnicus> ska was originally a form of reggae
[6:01:44] <ChocolateMoofin> Can we have a stream where you vibe to reggae
[6:01:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> No
[6:01:45] <+twohitgood> depends on what ska. ska punk (3rd wave) is more from punk than the original stuff.
[6:01:50] <%SirGO0SE> +2
[6:01:50] <%Ranryu692> LOL
[6:01:51] <+Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Wait how the hell did you enjoy THUG if you couldn't stand ska.

[6:02:02] <+xerotwo> LUL
