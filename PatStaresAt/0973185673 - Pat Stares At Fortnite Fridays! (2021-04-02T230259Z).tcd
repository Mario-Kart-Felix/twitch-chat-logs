[0:58:44] <+BusterRepukken> are people in chat actually mad Pat is playing Fortnite
[0:58:48] <%sniffy77> i feel like thats why you like this game. its because of the plentitude of children to make sad

[0:58:54] <Brandon__Brando> I love how people hate that your playing this so much

[0:59:01] <+buttdirt> that's how you win
[0:59:02] <+Itselguapo> 12 guys left
[0:59:02] <%maenos2> >:(
[0:59:02] <bakkatohri> Fishing is actually pretty useful because fish are faster at healing you and give you a ton of buffs
[0:59:05] <%MisterRockett> @maenos2 Battle Royals encourage camping.
[0:59:06] <Frostydough1> THIS is how winners win
[0:59:06] <%logoth_> take THAT player 273

[0:59:12] <IminyourBase> that's gross the hud shows you sounds so you can camp even harder
[0:59:15] <munitalprats> This makes ME want to play fortnite just to spite and bully the children.

[0:59:18] <+Itselguapo> the wolves?
[0:59:18] <%maenos2> @MisterRockett I know I just like giving pat shit
[0:59:24] <kentrix11> I find it really interesting that you are playing this overall.
[0:59:24] <CISphil> This is a game literally about building a camping spot
[0:59:25] <+LvckyLvc> Nice glowing backbling
[0:59:25] <DudeDern> Pat not grabbing the ammo boxes gives me pain
[0:59:30] <+Catpurnicus> further in the circle
[0:59:30] <s1rcuit> @placeholder03 because in the original mode (Save the World) the world was being overcast by storm that turned people into zombies and you had to make a fort to defend yourself
[0:59:31] <Press_X_ToJASON> @munitalprats this is why you play
[0:59:32] <%ChestMimik> Fight ended
[0:59:34] <%extradopeness> get down!

[0:59:37] <+KOD_LAMASI> "Patrick Bartholomew Boivin, are you camping again?" -Pat's mom
[0:59:41] <bakkatohri> @munitalprats The children will bully you though - ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A DEFAULT

[1:14:29] <%AzureGale> Exposed!
[1:14:30] <%MechArch> oof
[1:14:31] <%TheBensonator_> Sacrifice your Lara Croft for more clips on the stream
[1:14:32] <%Nuclearcherries> Hope they make a new Tomb Raider more in line with the classics someday
[1:14:33] <karovus> i wish the modern tomb raider games were better
[1:14:33] <+Epic_Fubar> Hahah
[1:14:35] <crowspeak> Great Job!
[1:14:35] <GeltonZ> @Ziegsy Yes
[1:14:38] <+Catpurnicus> they need a PS1 version of lara
[1:14:38] <%patriotrenegade> DRINK
[1:14:38] <bakkatohri> @TheCoolestRyker  If you played Uncharted, you played the Tomb Raider reboot games
[1:14:39] <ullyzeez> terrible aim
[1:14:44] <%TheBensonator_> 10/10, Pat
[1:14:46] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[1:14:48] <+Catpurnicus> the less polygons the better
[1:14:49] <Estuko> Tomb Raider is great, she's cool and doesn't afraid of anything
[1:14:49] <$realm_forge> Did you win?
[1:14:51] <+BusterRepukken> if lara croft got decent games, she'd be back on the forefront
[1:14:51] <+Kalinflip> lmaoo
[1:14:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat loving the fortnites is honestly the biggest twist of 2021
[1:14:53] <%TallPixels> unfortunate
[1:14:53] <%Ziegsy> @GeltonZ ...But, guns..
[1:14:56] <%MisterRockett> @TheCoolestRyker Literally all of them are on Steam give em a shot.
[1:14:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> I don't think at all :)
[1:14:59] <+BusterRepukken> souless
[1:14:59] <+Kalinflip> the fool almost killed itself
[1:15:00] <rcand9> modern tomb raiders removed fun
[1:15:01] <+Soliloquy123> I thought I heard they were like, *okay*
[1:15:03] <+Catpurnicus> they lack working TRESS EFFECTS
[1:15:07] <%captain_thickthighs> its like there tryin gto be movies
[1:15:08] <+LvckyLvc> 900xp for like 1min of play time, damn, I might start playing solo instead of TR
[1:15:08] <%Deft_Thought> They're too busy being Unchated
[1:15:11] <BlueBiscuitGT> full of themselves I would say instead
[1:15:11] <+Dorf1> no horses
[1:15:13] <TallPixels> the Lara model is so good tho
[1:15:14] <+alexanderthefine> they took a lot of cues from uncharted
[1:15:16] <bob900000> uninspired
[1:15:17] <%baka_sugoi> its okay
[1:15:17] <+NickNackProductions> they're good but they don't have the SOUL of old tomb raider
[1:15:19] <%saadi90> They were just Uncharted
[1:15:19] <GeltonZ> @Ziegsy Batman doesn't shoot people. Fortnite players aren't people.
[1:15:20] <Mr_Ease> the safest torture porn I've ever seen
[1:15:21] <%MisterRockett> They're lacking Lara's personality and fun platforming.
[1:15:23] <bakkatohri> Did they continue doing the gruesome death scenes in the later games after the first one?
[1:15:24] <%TheBensonator_> Unsharted
[1:15:24] <Sunstalker> Uncharted also peaked with 2. FeelsBadMan
[1:15:25] <+NickHatesSnow> the first game has a dinosaur in like level 1
[1:15:26] <+TheotherKristian> They're one of the most functional action trilogies out there
[1:15:26] <+BusterRepukken> theyre soulless triple a wannabes
[1:15:27] <+bubblebasspickles> the first one was the best
[1:15:28] <ullyzeez> @dorf1 LUL
[1:15:30] <+Invaderjaymz> I liked the first two a lot, could'nt get into the last one
[1:15:33] <+Cactuskris> nathan drake copied tomb raider to tomb raider copies it
[1:15:34] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt What about the fetishistically designed death animations
[1:15:35] <%W1nterTitan> Feel like a board room made it to fill the Q3 sales.
[1:15:36] <+Drspiderskull92> I want my tomb raider to have dinosaurs damn it
[1:15:37] <gunstars20> Dude Raider
[1:15:40] <+MitchPfitz> they have an unfortunate lack of dinosaurs
[1:15:42] <%Ziegsy> @GeltonZ I- I cant argue with this.
[1:15:45] <+cascadepersona> Yeah, they're good but not exceptional (save for the director's affection for Lara's bloody demise)
[1:15:46] <$IDGJohn> I dunno about that Pat. They used r@p3 as character development
[1:15:49] <+alexanderthefine> new tomb raider is waluigi
[1:15:50] <rcand9> laughable
[1:15:51] <crowspeak> That chainsaw thing is sick
[1:15:52] <+alexanderthefine> a copy of a copy
[1:15:53] <NOBLExGAMER> I really hate how in those games they take every opportunity to beat the fuck outta Laura. Like explicitly and brutally.
[1:15:55] <%Deft_Thought> The story is a mess
[1:15:56] <%kyh9> Wait, the story in what?
[1:15:56] <+mikesapartment> remember when lara caused the apocalypse and didnt wanna stop it
[1:16:05] <%MisterRockett> Terry Pratchett's daughter wrote the first one.
[1:16:05] <+BusterRepukken> yeah the first tomb raider reboots fetish for lara dying
[1:16:14] <placeholder03> Well they're like prequels right?
[1:16:15] <bakkatohri> I'm gonna come out and say it... I don't think British accents are hot.
[1:16:15] <+Catpurnicus> mamoru the tomb raider
[1:16:17] <+EdenOfLove> nryona fans are the worst
[1:16:17] <%kyh9> Oh, the new Tomb Raider games.  Yeah, writing isn't their strong point
[1:16:18] <huskarl_zap> the whole chat begins flossing
[1:16:20] <TheSphereHunter> the animations are so pointless
[1:16:25] <%jarednotwithsubway> REAL GAMER HOURS
[1:16:26] <TheSphereHunter> FORTNITE FRIDAYS!
[1:16:26] <%Deft_Thought> Old Tomb Raider stories weren't worth a damn but the new Lara is just confusing
[1:16:27] <Mr_Ease> its simultaneously too safe, AND torture porn
[1:16:27] <jorniev> FETISHIZATION OF DEATH
[1:16:32] <%BoxNavy> that glider is cool
[1:16:32] <Estuko> Remember when Lara Croft ran onto a boat with Thor's hammmer and decimated a bunch of people
[1:16:33] <+LvckyLvc> Do you think we'll get Lara in Mortal Kombat, all I can think about is about how those fucked up death scenes would fit in
[1:16:36] <Tracazoid> The water rapid into the wooden spike that Conan got squeamish over is the worst
[1:16:36] <+Drspiderskull92> Irish accents though
[1:16:37] <2DSuperiority> Conan freaking out over those death animations was the best thing out of those games honestly
[1:16:40] <GeltonZ> I wish I could see Nathan Drake get as beat up as reboot Lara Croft.
[1:16:40] <%cvp5127> win win
[1:16:47] <%Ziegsy> @bakkatohri How dare you. Thats all I have going for me
[1:16:47] <%Monkeyweed21> those games have the guro tag
[1:16:48] <+OmegaWeltall> Dark Spear eh? Kappa
[1:16:49] <+Catpurnicus> the river death animations were the worst
[1:16:50] <%patriotrenegade> The only thing I remember about the Tomb Raider reboots is Lara crying over a deer after murdering 50 dudes and Baba Yaga
[1:16:52] <mortificent> ahhhh damn the Sphere Hunter is here
[1:16:53] <Broken_Sonex> The one with spike going through her mouth made me realise this was some fetish shit. @PatStaresAt
[1:16:53] <marvel877> ITS HOSTEL, THE GAME.
[1:16:55] <%TallPixels> oh thats where taht sentence was going
[1:16:56] <PartyFavors> did that jar just say "slur" at me
[1:16:56] <%chance_h> spitroasted
[1:16:57] <+BusterRepukken> someone in the animation department furiously zerking off
[1:16:59] <%JoshManVGH> The story of the Rise of Tomb Raider was fine.
[1:16:59] <%zeroarturia> AAYY its CapMom Suzi!! thesph1JillGOODJOB
[1:17:00] <%MisterRockett> Oh god is this the chug jug factory?
[1:17:09] <BlueBiscuitGT> The wierdest thing is that they framed the reboot as Lara "becoming" her classic self, but old Lara was never as bloodthirsty as new!Lara has become
[1:17:09] <marvel877> Did Eli Roth make those reboot games?
[1:17:10] <2DSuperiority> Laura is like a rose
[1:17:10] <Press_X_ToJASON> it is
[1:17:14] <rcand9> what happened to bad ass lara?
[1:17:16] <+Soliloquy123> Very important for the characterization that Lara struggles with a length of rebar through the torso
[1:17:19] <+HyperCharge_Sam> lara croft falling down the pit and hitting the fucking rebar and screaming in pain, hell yeah
[1:17:22] <%GarbageNirvana> I think what makes it worse is that she struggles to pull herself off for a couple seconds before dying
[1:17:23] <Sunstalker> Fuck druckmann for moving Uncharted away from supernatural shit
[1:17:26] <%AzureGale> SNEAK ATTACK MOTHEREFFER
[1:17:27] <+Itselguapo> yes this is chug jug factory
[1:17:28] <+Drspiderskull92> that's where the Chugallo lives
[1:17:31] <%captain_thickthighs> dude near by across the way
[1:17:41] <%SirGO0SE> omg these are 6 yr olds
[1:17:43] <Estuko> But I want Lara Croft that killed a giant underground serpent
[1:17:43] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah that's like some Mortal Kombat fatality shit
[1:17:52] <%saadi90> That poor child on his phone
[1:17:55] <mortificent> the supernatural shit in Uncharted was so cool imo
[1:17:58] <jorniev> dev: its not a creepy sex thing!  everyone else: its also NOT not a creepy sex thing
[1:18:03] <TheSphereHunter> I am no longer streaming
[1:18:03] <+Quinn_Carter> Is this the ironic turned unironic Fortnite streamer? rooAww
[1:18:04] <Estuko> I still have Anniversary and Underworld and Legend on steam, love those games.
[1:18:06] <+Cactuskris> the worst thing about the first rebbot tomb raider is that there is a guy in love with lara who almost kills the whole crew to actually get a kiss from her
[1:18:13] <Krakenoid> there is at least two people nearby
[1:18:17] <+NickNackProductions> remember angel of darkness :^)
[1:18:19] <rcand9> suzi plays the fortnite?
[1:18:21] <%BoxNavy> the slurp monkaS
[1:18:22] <ullyzeez> @mortificent yeah it was a shame that they tossed it in 4
[1:18:22] <+Itselguapo> I'm gonna buy the edgelord skin
[1:18:30] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:18:38] <jorniev> @rcand9 because the chun-li but
[1:18:41] <%PatVA_> Hit those barrels Pat
[1:18:43] <GeltonZ> @rcand9 Yeah, came in here asking if Pat wanted to team up
[1:18:49] <TheCoolestRyker> Pat take a bath in the shield juice
[1:18:54] <Press_X_ToJASON> he doesnt want the slurp
[1:18:57] <mortificent> @ullyzeez yeah, at least the main villain was entertaining with how much of a petty asshole he was
[1:18:58] <+EdenOfLove> Are "makeshift" guns worse than other guns?
[1:19:00] <%ChestMimik> punked
[1:19:01] <rcand9> @jorniev of course
[1:19:04] <Broken_Sonex> @rcand9 It is a fantastic ass to be fair.
[1:19:05] <%Deft_Thought> I keep debating getting RE3make
[1:19:07] <Press_X_ToJASON> might have won if he got the slurp
[1:19:07] <OperatorJo_> F
[1:19:07] <%jarednotwithsubway> oof, get rocked
[1:19:10] <crowspeak> Isn't Blood Gulch in Fortnite?
[1:19:12] <%MisterRockett> @Cactuskris The worst thing about the reboots is that Laura is completely defined by her relationship with men. The first game is about her 5 dads. The second focuses so much on her dad that they bring him up in lue of fleshing out Laura's personality. I did not bother with the third one.
[1:19:12] <%BoxNavy> simply get one
[1:19:14] <Frade> why would you play this? Pat
[1:19:18] <Serge_12> Guys, dont forget to use creator code Patstaresat

[1:19:20] <%ChestMimik> the fuck are they doing?
[1:19:20] <ullyzeez> why would you do that
[1:19:22] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Can anyone tell me how Suzi and the SBF crew know each other? I found Suzi through them, but can't figure out how
[1:19:22] <FennecZephyr> To be fair, that was a really bad spot to use a bow
[1:19:25] <%TallPixels> have you tried team rumble?
[1:19:34] <%saadi90> Ah I see

[1:19:57] <+ChaosedStar> I hate how this game is actually fun, you got me to try it and it feels good lol
[1:19:57] <%valriot> LUL

[1:22:17] <rcand9> king among men
[1:22:20] <%thelaxinator> Of course you don't get the appeal everyday you have a hot lady tower over you
[1:22:22] <%valriot> The appeal is woman big
[1:22:23] <KohryuZX> You were BORN in the dream Pat
[1:22:23] <+Drspiderskull92> vampire lady got a truck with a wagon
[1:22:24] <+hennesyhufflepuf> Snuu Snuu
[1:22:26] <Meltgar> GAMING
[1:22:27] <%thelaxinator> It's your tuesday
[1:22:27] <Sunstalker> We know, Pat. Every woman is the Tall Woman to you.
[1:22:28] <+umudon> who?
[1:22:28] <%MisterRockett> Tried to go back in
[1:22:30] <DrStinkers> everyone secretly want to feel like pat
[1:22:31] <OperatorJo_> Dudes like Mmm yes quite large yes mmm GlitchNRG
[1:22:33] <bob900000> pat you are living the dream
[1:22:33] <+OmegaWeltall> hey im 6'2" and i'd love a gf who towers over me Kreygasm
[1:22:34] <DracaenaLeaf> tfw everyone is taller than pat
[1:22:36] <karovus> the internets reaction to that character was kinda nuts
[1:22:40] <crowspeak> They dont show player names?
[1:22:41] <+noobzoar_two_hands> wow that sound radial thing is busted
[1:22:44] <T_Sasquatch> Most men don't know what it feels like to be towered by a woman
[1:22:52] <+BusterRepukken> the new RE 8 trailer just focusses on Lady's ass, Capcom knows
[1:22:52] <+Quinn_Carter> Pat how does it feel to completely stomp childrens' face's in at the favourite game?
[1:22:58] <Broken_Sonex> I appreciate that she's got a fat ass too. Vampire Lady ain't all tits she got the bakery too.
[1:23:00] <Krakenoid> MANY VIOLENCE in front
[1:23:01] <%maenos2> honestly dimitrescu does nothing for me but i'm glad for the internet's thirst if nothing else
[1:23:01] <%JoshManVGH> Don't get the appeal of tall lady, or being thrown by tall lady.
[1:23:10] <%valriot> Fortnites good at like, forcing engagements
[1:23:10] <+Drspiderskull92> they absolutely know
[1:23:11] <bakkatohri> Fortnite is more forgiving because they don't have as many bullshit sniper guns that one shot you.
[1:23:11] <+RyTYoung> uhh guys
[1:23:11] <Meltgar> Oh NO BUILDING Kappa
[1:23:12] <%Daxalog> Its all about confidence
[1:23:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat do the Floss
[1:23:14] <sightlesspoem> AW FUCK BECOME BUILDING
[1:23:15] <bob900000> less cheaters?
[1:23:16] <%Undenizen> i noticed that too! something is WEIRD about the framerate? or maybe the animation?
[1:23:19] <+RyTYoung> my disco elysium save file is gone
[1:23:19] <+DinnerCalzone> thats because fortnite actually feels good to control
[1:23:21] <+ChaosedStar> That's cause you have that in your relationship being small. I wanna feel small for once  haha @PatStaresAt
[1:23:22] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> It was super cool going from here to Vinny's stream two nights in a row, that's my usual schedule anyway :D
[1:23:23] <GeltonZ> @Quinn_Carter DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE 8 YEAR OLDS.
[1:23:24] <%ChestMimik> ye
[1:23:24] <%thelaxinator> When you're six feet tall meeting a taller woman is an event.
[1:23:26] <+Avossk_> nice!
[1:23:31] <OperatorJo_> oof nice
[1:23:32] <huskarl_zap> C RANK DAT 90
[1:23:34] <bakkatohri> The weapons with really long range need skill to use - and that's why Fortnite is cool.
[1:23:38] <BottleRockette> oh fuc chicken time
[1:23:39] <%Tuna_Can_0> that fucking aim assist might as well be aimbot holy shit
[1:23:43] <%Garthunox> Pat you know you're just Memphis Tennesse from the Sonic 06 Fandub rn right? Wanna get tilted at the towers?
[1:23:45] <%dekkitout> @thelaxinator Amen
[1:23:48] <+BIumen> this car-tree-house battle is pretty raw
[1:23:49] <+Quinn_Carter> @GeltonZ Can I at least judge the 8 year olds?
[1:24:03] <%ChestMimik> Now that Pat's Bowlust is sated, he'll totally crush these children
[1:24:03] <+BusterRepukken> bye Mando
[1:24:05] <GeltonZ> @Quinn_Carter Oh sure. Judge them HARSHLY.
[1:24:09] <Krakenoid> like a vulture
[1:24:09] <jorniev> HUNT THE HUNTER
[1:24:10] <Meltgar> Man, health and shields GO DOWN FAST
[1:24:12] <mortificent> yeyeyeye THE CLEAN UP
[1:24:14] <Kief_Meister> Medkit outside
[1:24:15] <rcand9> why is everyone player name 999 is it so you cant bully children?
[1:24:16] <Zebroneath> poor dumb child
[1:24:18] <skyentombment> @thelaxinator Yo, I once met a lady from the states that was like 6'7 or something and I was just in AWE
[1:24:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's probably because the game that PUBG is based on is already super jank and making your own version of that type of combat is also gonna be jank
[1:24:24] <jorniev> MAN THAT LADY IS TALL
[1:24:24] <Kief_Meister> if you want the backseating lmao
[1:24:25] <huskarl_zap> 1 kill = 1 floss
[1:24:33] <kentrix11> There was a medkit in the bus I think
[1:24:36] <s1rcuit> @rcand9 streamer mode
[1:24:40] <jorniev> heck yeah
[1:24:41] <%Garthunox> @thelaxinator smash?
[1:24:41] <+skeletonmilk> @PatStaresAt what is the biggest dick energy weapon in MH Rise?
[1:24:42] <+LvckyLvc> cabbages out back
[1:24:44] <bakkatohri> Nobody talks about Hyper Scape because it's really generic.
[1:24:45] <rcand9> ooooh
[1:24:46] <Sunstalker> What we need is a Bloodborne 2 with a 9 foot tall Maria. :)
[1:24:51] <+Drspiderskull92> it's probably because pat has it so we cant stream snipe him
[1:24:55] <%GarbageNirvana> The hell is this Toontown architecture
[1:24:55] <Traysanford161> Epic fortnite gamer
[1:24:56] <%Ziegsy> why can you not eat the cabbage?
[1:25:01] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt You can eat the lettuce to get some health back quicker
[1:25:02] <+ChaosAethr> wasnt there heal in that bus you were in a moment ago?

[1:25:11] <+Quinn_Carter> cheer500 Hey Pat, how does it feel to disco stomp children in their own baby game?
[1:25:11] <Krakenoid> do you hear that. that's the sound of. preteen urban violence
[1:25:12] <cronicconquest> Pat buy the Ninja Skin
[1:25:13] <skyentombment> I was unsure whether to feel insecure or kind of aroused
[1:25:15] <Frostydough1> pog teenagers
[1:25:17] <%Boxortoo> There's a medkit in the bus lmao
[1:25:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Some of them POG
[1:25:22] <+RyTYoung> Okay so I shit my pants BC I booted up the PS4 version of disco instead of the ps5, why install both versions NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:25:22] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt At the last house you were at, cabbaged
[1:25:23] <crowspeak> Do the kids got good taste in games Pat?
[1:25:23] <TheSphereHunter> how do I destroy in this game?
[1:25:29] <Meltgar> CONSUME
[1:25:30] <%ChestMimik> CONSUME
[1:25:33] <%Ziegsy> You can?!
[1:25:35] <skyentombment> MY CABBAGES!
[1:25:38] <%Ziegsy> This makes me so happy!
[1:25:39] <%Boxortoo> @TheSphereHunter you dunk on the kids of course.
[1:25:39] <rufus2k2> that's cute
[1:25:40] <+FrozenOcelot> @PatStaresAt hey Pat glad you're enjoying this game. I always want to go back to fortnite but then get reminded of the tryhard builders on pc
[1:25:41] <$superorangerobin> Pat, being an leprechaun, is drawn to cabbages
[1:25:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kids have no taste by definition
[1:25:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> consume cabbej
[1:25:51] <+CornyAir> Cabbages Cabbages, barely even human
[1:25:54] <+titansloth93> Eat Leaf to heal bullet wound
[1:25:56] <bakkatohri> You heard about lemon-stealing whores... now get ready for....
[1:26:00] <rcand9> im not gonna lie this looks fun but i refuse to play out of dumb principle
[1:26:02] <+hennesyhufflepuf> Take them with you just to be safe
[1:26:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> They just have to try even harder
[1:26:04] <gitdweezzy> does anyone else try to stealth like pat?
[1:26:05] <rufus2k2> what's that ring that appears, being pinged by enemies?
[1:26:07] <%Daxalog> The ratio of the sweat is higher on PC.
[1:26:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Trihards
[1:26:10] <%BoxNavy> you will be sweated upon
[1:26:11] <earthboy2k> how many 12 years have you beat up today Pat
[1:26:13] <gunstars20> the ultimate Builders
[1:26:30] <%ShitLord> look like bots honestly
[1:26:31] <rufus2k2> THEY GONNA LEARN TODAY
[1:26:33] <Meltgar> Pat the ULTIMATE CHILDREN BULLY
[1:26:33] <$RealThiele> whata  hero
[1:26:34] <%ChestMimik> bludgeon the children
[1:26:35] <Meltgar> Kappa
[1:26:37] <TheSphereHunter> what are these awareness icons on your screen?
[1:26:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> lotta children playing on console
[1:26:39] <%thelaxinator> way back when the game came out I recall seeing webms of people just instantly erecting a 40 foot tall diamond tower. I take it that's not a thing anymore?
[1:26:40] <OldManDeckardCain> when john fortnite inevitably comes to smash, he needs to become a giant building as his final smash LUL
[1:26:40] <megaRammy> I thought the crossplay was skill based matchmaking without regarding what control device was being used
[1:26:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Beat a kid TONIGHT
[1:26:42] <%JoshManVGH> Banana?
[1:26:42] <%MajorCrasher> Pat: slayer of small children
[1:26:42] <+RyTYoung> Mac and Charlie team up on those kids!
[1:26:49] <Krakenoid> the children must be taught a grim lesson
[1:26:53] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Nah man; some of those people are me. 30 y/o men who suck at this game
[1:26:54] <Ultimatefool> Life motto
[1:26:55] <rufus2k2> FTK - Michael jordan
[1:26:56] <Sunstalker> TheSphereHunter Footsteps and loot
[1:26:56] <TheSphereHunter> omg
[1:26:57] <%Eaglestrike117> You left ammo behind
[1:26:58] <skyentombment> Yes it does
[1:27:00] <%ShitLord> its funny how Fortnite is fine, but GTA god forbid
[1:27:00] <Krakenoid> their education shall be taught in brass
[1:27:01] <%ChestMimik> But can you beat up FIFTY children
[1:27:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kids need to learn to deal with defeats
[1:27:01] <bakkatohri> You can turn crossplay off so you don't play against PC players, right?
[1:27:01] <Kief_Meister> @bakkatohri You know, I saw that vid during a halloween party lmao
[1:27:02] <%Deft_Thought> CLIP THAT
[1:27:02] <xcompleasedad> @TheSphereHunter Legal cheats. For the hard of hearing. Kappa
[1:27:02] <SpaceManHotepIV> just ask rey mysterio
[1:27:03] <%Boxortoo> @TheSphereHunter they're meant for deaf people but they're basically cheating because they tell you where people are coming from or shooting from lmao
[1:27:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[1:27:04] <FrankyBerry> Yea teach those zoomers, Pat
[1:27:06] <%BinaryFireball> how many kids has pat murdered?
[1:27:08] <%dekkitout> *Said one Eren*
[1:27:08] <+RyTYoung> Pat...
[1:27:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its a lesson
[1:27:09] <ullyzeez> why does the shield only go till 50?
[1:27:10] <crowspeak> I dont think i got good at video games until i was 12
[1:27:10] <GeltonZ> That's why this is Palpatine's favorite game! He LOVES killing Younglings!
[1:27:10] <%greasypete00> shoot you from far away
[1:27:10] <gunstars20> Yeeee fight the kids LUL
[1:27:11] <OperatorJo_> tryhard builders are what turned me off Fortnite in the first place. I want to SHOOT not minecraft my way up a 20 story building that came out of nowhere
[1:27:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes, Pat, beat all the children of the world
[1:27:14] <those_bananas> Pat fights someone his own size for once
[1:27:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> show them despair.
[1:27:17] <%AzureGale> wat
[1:27:18] <$realm_forge> the true evil
[1:27:19] <$superorangerobin> Pat the mindkiller
[1:27:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Careful, saying stuff like that might get you elected president
[1:27:20] <Vertigheist> FUCK THEM KIDS
[1:27:21] <+JavaManJoJo> I haven't played in about a season but in my experience most players on PC will at least pop up a wall and stairs at minimum. But I actually find some enjoyment from some build fights
[1:27:23] <+Avossk_> loving these outta context quotes
[1:27:25] <Laveyrin> ssjFlex
[1:27:25] <sightlesspoem> pat is officially smarter than children
[1:27:25] <%Boxortoo> @ullyzeez small shield pot doesn't give more then 50 shield
[1:27:26] <camelwizard> Defeat their persona one could say
[1:27:26] <bob900000> kids are tall now
[1:27:27] <Mister_McDerp> go full anakin skywalker on those kids
[1:27:29] <+BusterRepukken> they need to add an Anakin Skywalker skin to Fortnite, slay some younglings.
[1:27:29] <+Drspiderskull92> god I need to get on and do my challenges this week
[1:27:30] <SpaceManHotepIV> Stomp on gen alpha live on  stream
[1:27:31] <skyentombment> Kicking a kid and send em flying like they are a football is a pleasure of the gods
[1:27:32] <%ChestMimik> @those_bananas No, Pat's still shorter
[1:27:32] <+derg0ns> So this is why Pat plays fortnite
[1:27:32] <%AzureGale> @ullyzeez Small shield potions can only bring your shield up to 50
[1:27:35] <rcand9> children are stupid and weak
[1:27:36] <%dekkitout> Yep...
[1:27:39] <%Ziegsy> How many 4 year olds do you think you could take at once?
[1:27:41] <ullyzeez> @boxortoo cool thanks
[1:27:41] <sightlesspoem> dont talk about woolie like that
[1:27:42] <%valriot> Welcome to the real world, you infants

[1:27:47] <viewtifulr> i thought you gonna say mom
[1:27:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> AND THAT WAS GOOD
[1:27:48] <rufus2k2> AND HE WAS RIGHT
[1:27:50] <%Piemono> Yeah, but kids these days play good games
[1:27:50] <%BoxNavy> they didnt say this but they were right also
[1:27:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[1:27:52] <Press_X_ToJASON> @ReallyBigRocks it might get you AND your opponent nominated!
[1:27:53] <Mister_McDerp> LUL
[1:27:54] <%AncelDeLambert> that's unpossible!
[1:27:54] <cronicconquest> Pat's good at this game because of his baby small hands
[1:27:55] <gunstars20> Oh boy LUL
[1:27:57] <%hananafell> How did they know the truth
[1:27:58] <%AzureGale> That's not true! That's impossible!
[1:27:59] <Krakenoid> pat 'the descending belt' bolvin
[1:27:59] <+Delenay> koboldOhNo
[1:27:59] <%dekkitout> Wow, what was that kid's name?

[1:28:01] <Kief_Meister> A HE THUS SPOKE THE TRUTH
[1:28:02] <%baka_sugoi> Life Cycle
[1:28:02] <Frostydough1> adn then a virtual figghter was never made again
[1:28:03] <%Boxortoo> I feel really bad because I play fortnite with my nephews and dunk on switch nerds.
[1:28:03] <$realm_forge> PAT YOURE IN YOUR 30’S
[1:28:05] <gunstars20> it was so true
[1:28:07] <%thelaxinator> So "chug jugging" is using a 50 potion? I feel so old...
[1:28:07] <+titansloth93> What do you think the Last fighting game will be?
[1:28:09] <%AncelDeLambert> psaBlind psaBlind
[1:28:12] <ullyzeez> that was even worse cuz the old guy basically stole your money at the arcades
[1:28:13] <Broken_Sonex> THAT'S THE TRUE WIN
[1:28:14] <+Drspiderskull92> now only 2 fighting games are allowed to come out a year
[1:28:18] <rufus2k2> so was that PS4 VF showdown listing real and did Pat cry?
[1:28:19] <pattymegs> Pat's a fortnite streamer now
[1:28:19] <bakkatohri> Fighting games are good for your brain I think. Like I feel like my reflexes are faster and my memory is better after messing around in training modes.
[1:28:19] <%BoxNavy> how can they fortnite
[1:28:24] <%baka_sugoi> old man wisdom
[1:28:25] <skyentombment> These look so much like lame renders from an architecture office
[1:28:34] <%Boxortoo> @thelaxinator Chug jug is a seperate item altogether, it can give 100 shield and it regens
[1:28:40] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt if you didnt know already if you hit the weak spots on the stuff your breaking, it gives you more materials
[1:28:51] <greencapps> Pat is making up for utterly failing to punch a child in Disco Elysium by killing hundreds in Fortnite
[1:28:53] <lloyddboy> toilet treasures
[1:28:54] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt What's the difference between PURE weapons and makeshift weapons?
[1:28:55] <sightlesspoem> poop chest
[1:28:55] <%Ziegsy> why gold?
[1:28:57] <%JoshManVGH> What is the purpose of the Harpoon gun?
[1:29:00] <Sunstalker> skyentombment Eh, it's much nicer quality then the architecture offices
[1:29:03] <%thelaxinator> @Boxortoo woof
[1:29:05] <JuggernautRyan> You were the chosen one! You were supposed to destroy the children, not join them!
[1:29:06] <%arcielardor> Pat has come a long way from learning how to pick stuff up
[1:29:07] <s1rcuit> @thelaxinator what Box said, but don't feel bad, you're not old you just don't play Fortnite
[1:29:09] <+Drspiderskull92> pat doesn't build so he only needs minum
[1:29:13] <rcand9> is resident evil in the fortnite yet like street fighter?
[1:29:14] <Frostydough1> wait it shows where chests are?? that visual audio thing is busted
[1:29:14] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Smart man
[1:29:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat goes into an office while crouching, and all I can think of is that Spiderman meme
[1:29:17] <%Boxortoo> @Ziegsy you can use it for bounty stuff. like buying stuff from npcs and stuff
[1:29:27] <%Boxortoo> @JoshManVGH You can grab stuff from a distance
[1:29:35] <sightlesspoem> patrick da storm D:

[1:30:00] <rufus2k2> I like how Pat went from military chick to cyborg abomination
[1:30:01] <+Capcommunist> im a grown ass man and this makes me want to play fork knife

[1:30:37] <munitalprats> THAT WAS TOTALLY JUST A BOT
[1:30:40] <+LvckyLvc> Does anyone know if crouch walking gets rid of your footsteps on the deaf person wheel? Or is there just no defence against it?
[1:30:40] <+BusterRepukken> bots dont run
[1:30:41] <Krakenoid> the coward wished to live and that was their folly.
[1:30:42] <+traximus_s> how far the ring
[1:30:42] <%ChestMimik> honk
[1:30:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Did this game ever have any kind of lore or did that get abandoned for infinite money deals
[1:30:44] <madeinyomama> Fortnite is fun. The children make it not fun. Tho beating them up is pretty fun so eh give and take
[1:30:45] <%Boxortoo> I can't believe Suzi is gonna join Pat in bullying the kids
[1:30:47] <Meltgar> Man, Bots on Console?

[1:31:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> It was actually Ninja
[1:31:23] <FalcoTheTwitchy> Dude, this aim assist is no joke

[1:31:42] <%ChestMimik> Pat will fight a child but not a velociraptor
[1:31:46] <%vaporousTippler> Pat is killing more children than the Ultima series.

[1:32:25] <%TallPixels> streamers dont have to be responsible for their pets ive seen it
[1:32:25] <%patriotrenegade> I wont dispute that
[1:32:25] <+Avossk_> thats fair

[1:32:29] <+sharpened_hammer> A bit yeah
[1:32:29] <%MugenSandan> okay but what if child vs victory over a child
[1:32:29] <%Agami23> i'd let you stab me for the dog
[1:32:30] <Gregorhasjoined> What podcasts and streams did she decide to load up on for her trip?
[1:32:31] <+titansloth93> I for one am happy to be beneath pat's dog in ranking
[1:32:31] <+OmegaWeltall> paaaaatah!

[1:32:35] <bob900000> SeemsGood
[1:32:35] <skyentombment> But Pat, streamer dads never tend to their kids, or wife
[1:32:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> I would stab you right back so fair
[1:32:36] <bakkatohri> JOKES ON YOU I'M INTO THAT SHIT
[1:32:36] <%dekkitout> You would, regardless of pupper
[1:32:37] <rcand9> and i wouldnt begrudge you
[1:32:37] <Ultimatefool> Yeah well my child is a bigger baby than your child! @PatStaresAt
[1:32:37] <+oktavia_von> as it should be
[1:32:38] <Fixer997> Not at all
[1:32:38] <CyborgAV> And you'd be right to
[1:32:40] <%ExpressNode> :O
[1:32:41] <%Tuna_Can_0> D:
[1:32:43] <Mvrdok_> Fair enough
[1:32:46] <%Ziegsy> I would punch pat in the nose if it made my dog happy, I understand
[1:32:49] <%AzureGale> Now I'm going to create a game called Pat Stares At: World Stabbing Tour
[1:32:52] <saiyanblitz> What did I do

[1:32:57] <$realm_forge> Joke’s on you pat you couldn’t get through my fat layer
[1:33:00] <%AncelDeLambert> *Jeopardy music*
[1:33:03] <rufus2k2> can other players hear that?
[1:33:03] <%Nuclearcherries> Paige is going to plague country? Hope she'll be OK
[1:33:04] <+ultimafullmetal> Wouldnt the dog cry when you go to prison for multiple stabbings?
[1:33:06] <%Undenizen> you'd stab any INDIVIDUAL, but probably not ALL of us
[1:33:11] <tyrell42> you would TRY... there's simply too many of us
[1:33:12] <+Capcommunist> is the money like warzone?
[1:33:13] <%Ziegsy> Like a more wholesome john wick

[1:33:31] <+ChaosedStar> What do you even buy with bars anyway?
[1:33:31] <bakkatohri> @PatStaresAt You can pretend you're the Solid Snake and disguise yourself as a box if you use the bars.
[1:33:33] <tyrell42> @undenizen gets it
[1:33:46] <%TallPixels> @PatStaresAt your gold resets at the start of the new season

[1:35:03] <%ChestMimik> Pat only broadcasts his voice on the platform to thousands
[1:35:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Send Zoomers to the Sun
[1:35:14] <Sunstalker> Yeah but it's ffornite pat. Who cares?
[1:35:14] <%thelaxinator> could luck routing an AT 2020 through a PS4

[1:35:28] <@SoFarFetched> thats fair
[1:35:30] <%AncelDeLambert> no but bully children, tho
[1:35:33] <sightlesspoem> because were ADULTS
[1:35:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> I WOULD BULLY U
[1:35:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> Gotta avoid  a potential racism
[1:35:41] <%BoxNavy> we would never have a streamsniper
[1:35:43] <%MechArch> anon killed the children
[1:35:44] <%Piemono> Is Pat big enough to get stream sniped now?
[1:35:44] <%Eaglestrike117> Its basically screen cheating
[1:35:45] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Oh so you would be "Anonymous12345?"
[1:35:46] <%Boxortoo> Stream sniping is more of a problem in comp mode then regular queues
[1:35:47] <%AncelDeLambert> it's cheating
[1:35:47] <+Stormzcales_Lair> it is anoyying
[1:35:48] <%Boxortoo> It's crazy
[1:35:48] <%dekkitout> Screen peaking, it's screen peaking
[1:35:49] <%ShitLord> bully bad
[1:35:49] <%Eaglestrike117> in Goldeneye
[1:35:52] <rcand9> dont bully these pathetic children guys thats not cool
[1:35:52] <+Radkon> Because you have so many fortnite players in yoru audience Kappa
[1:35:57] <+LvckyLvc> Have you been stream sniped at all?
[1:35:59] <NitronStreams> so no one can go on stream with the name "Pats Balls"
[1:36:05] <+Delenay> its just like playing split screen but with someone that you cant punch for screen spying
[1:36:10] <Darkdrill> LUL pat bully the kids back by insta killing them
[1:36:14] <bakkatohri> Companions in this game will give away your location to other players - especially if you're standing still. It's happened to me a lot.
[1:36:15] <%maenos2> i'm glad you enjoy fortnite pat but man does this game make me feel old for some reason.
[1:36:15] <%Monkeyweed21> that reminds me of creaming Woolie in Lethal League Blaze
[1:36:15] <%ChestMimik> That holograms puttin in work
[1:36:16] <%thelaxinator> People stream-sniped Paige in PUBG but all they did was honk at her. I think she won the round.
[1:36:20] <Meltgar> That's why the Blue haired Shaggy got tired of ForkNite, cause he was getting stream sniped 24/7 Kappa
[1:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> WOAH rockets
[1:36:25] <%Boxortoo> rip ryu
[1:36:26] <s1rcuit> it's basically cheating against a specific person
[1:36:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's screen peeking but worse because they aren't your friends
[1:36:28] <+WhicheverComa> How does que-ing like that even work with like 500 million players at a time

[1:54:42] <+Bogart4321> stop asking women if you want that meat
[1:54:44] <beatie_g> Pat’s stuck in lower lobbies for having a team mate and can’t be stopped
[1:54:47] <Kief_Meister> @radiosanchezz Why not fuckboy

[1:55:40] <Sunstalker> beatie_g Suzi is almost twice his level LUL If anything it would push him up in lobbies
[1:55:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fishing POG
[1:55:42] <+Night2wolf> fish are really good healing items

[1:55:45] <+Drspiderskull92> ok legit the fishing in fortnite is pretty good
[1:55:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does the game tell you how many bots are in your lobby?
[1:55:45] <placeholder03> just like the red dead
[1:55:46] <+DrTribal> fishing is busted wym?

[1:56:13] <+thelonechris> The Pat model would be unfair, as he would be too small to properly aim at
[1:56:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's gaining REAL LIFE XP
[1:56:15] <%Piemono> Pat's character model would have to be standing on a milk crate
[1:56:17] <+DrTribal> @MrMoonGoose yes and no
[1:56:17] <ZilverZap> is this a battle royal or a survival sim now
[1:56:17] <tukds> Pat's SEO is way down he needs big number

[1:56:41] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt I won't lie, I bought 100$ of vbucks after you got that last win to celebrate.

[1:56:56] <%AzureGale> Waiting in a room is like 99% of playing a battle royale
[1:56:56] <akibanoman> oh my god I just tuned back in he dragged suzi into this
[1:56:59] <%TheBensonator_> Y'all say it, but do you realize HOW HYPE A PAT SKIN WOULD BE?!?!
[1:56:59] <%muetank> No one would play as the pat skin. It would be looked down on, like playing odd job in Goldeneye
[1:57:01] <%extradopeness> No thanks
[1:57:05] <thatlolifrompersona1> Yee yee All the V-bucks
[1:57:07] <Krakenoid> the next upcoming fort night event: the majima everywhere system takes on fortnite
[1:57:12] <cherrycottontail> people have spent 2000 on vbucks from your code already?
[1:57:13] <%TheBensonator_> ITS LIKE ODDJOB, SHORT SKINS ARE BUSTED Y'ALL

[1:57:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> You listen for shooting and kill them
[1:57:21] <GeltonZ> @akibanoman Suzi was already there...waiting...in the Fortnite Pits.
[1:57:25] <+Itselguapo> PS4 the wifi is super shite on it
[1:57:30] <%logoth_> Too bad we never got that titanfall battle royale
[1:57:37] <%MechArch> that's just a home simulator
[1:57:41] <+glgzephyr> Pat, you're supposed to constantly move in PUBG LUL
[1:57:50] <CalciumTax> @muetank calling Pat Oddjob is little too accurate.
[1:57:54] <CalciumTax> 5.2" btw
[1:57:56] <%MechArch> but with guns, so america
[1:57:57] <+Drspiderskull92> give me a solid snake skin
[1:57:59] <%Boxortoo> @logoth_ It's funny because they're adding the villain from titanfall 2 into apex next, he summons a fucking titan too.
[1:58:03] <bakkatohri> PUBG is being always scared of snipers playing duck hunt with optic attachments.
[1:58:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pleb taste Pat
[1:58:07] <+DrTribal> @glgzephyr thats why pubg is dead
[1:58:10] <+mikesapartment> longer kill times = skill

[1:58:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> @bakkatohri Same as Warzone
[1:58:30] <+RyTYoung> BEST FEELING
[1:58:32] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt Would you play TABG since it went free to play yesterday?
[1:58:48] <%JoshManVGH> Or rainbow six, where you have to spot a pixel and shoot it
[1:58:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Battlefield games have a slower Time To Kill as well. You can react
[1:59:04] <%TallPixels> if you die its your fault
[1:59:14] <Qsmash_> he's building a fort...he's FORTNITING
[1:59:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chat lets talk about how Killzone 2 multiplayer was really good. Because it was
[1:59:18] <SpaceManHotepIV> shits on fire yo
[1:59:23] <gunstars20> FIRE
[1:59:23] <+Drspiderskull92> all shields do is put more time on the clock

[2:20:28] <+archangel9889> Pat you sold me on fortnight despite the company that publishes it.
[2:20:30] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt tell suzi she can use the harpoon gun to fish too
[2:20:32] <Sunstalker> I bet there's kids out there that think fortnite invented the pick axe
[2:20:32] <rufus2k2> @Kief_Meister  NotLikeThis
[2:20:33] <Josef_Stryker> Is that Snake Eyes as a skin?
[2:20:37] <bakkatohri> In fact, they should retcon DC3 out of the DC canon.

[2:22:41] <bear_breaker20> what child has even HEARD of GIJoe

[3:09:06] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt You would have died in the process...but you would have died anyway so whatever lmao
[3:09:06] <%za7az> Isn't the KappaHD emote literally to denote sarcasm?
[3:09:07] <Reanimator83> Pat fucked over that one guy. gg LUL
[3:09:07] <sightlesspoem> when will pat revise his views on the confereacy?!
[3:09:08] <LunarRemix> There's also a card she drops that you can revive her from the van
[3:09:11] <Grandma_Amari> At least you killed that one child
[3:09:11] <RayCSmooth> you had heals pat Kappa
[3:09:18] <Sunstalker> That person should have made his parents break up if he wanted to be good enough to win this game
[3:09:19] <switchbored505> If I'm going down, at least let me ruin one more person's game before I do
[3:09:21] <%thelaxinator> do not ever attempt offensive sarcasm on the internet
[3:09:29] <Kief_Meister> @Grandma_Amari Nah he had people on him
[3:09:31] <$Dakuu75> Damn, I really wanted to watch Pat play Outriders because I been enjoying it myself but, I jsut got off work. How the outriders portion go?
[3:09:32] <%thelaxinator> only self-deprecating sarcasm can come across in text
[3:09:32] <sightlesspoem> unless youre pat
[3:09:35] <sightlesspoem> then its ok
[3:09:40] <+glgzephyr> Sarcasm through text died years ago. Don't use it unless you know the person you're talking to.
[3:09:40] <%captain_thickthighs> guy fucked up a comment if its a consistant thing then ban if not move on
[3:09:43] <taken_lul> is that one guy banned?
[3:09:45] <Grandma_Amari> Aw
[3:09:50] <eco419> Pat why you kill Suzi BibleThump
[3:09:54] <ioriac> @QueequegTheater Why pay when slave labor is free
[3:09:54] <%QueequegTheater> I hope that guy only got a timeout
[3:09:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Dakuu75 servers are fucky today as their twitter has been updated.
[3:09:58] <@SoFarFetched> And no only a time out.
[3:09:58] <%AzureGale> @Dakuu75 Stared at a login screen for about half the time
[3:10:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> what happened?
[3:10:00] <+BusterRepukken> hes not banned, he got timed out.
[3:10:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Dakuu75 Servers were fucked so it didn't really
[3:10:03] <+SuicidalLemmming> i know sarcasm is failed by text but sometimes it really is obvious.
[3:10:04] <@SoFarFetched> Its literally just 10 minutes.
[3:10:06] <Kief_Meister> Nah fuck that guy
[3:10:08] <%DedlokPM> @Dakuu75 Server issues cut it short
[3:10:09] <+DrTribal> communication through text alone is such bullshit lol
[3:10:11] <APB_Harleqyn> I am DYING to know what Suzi was going to ask Pat about.
[3:10:16] <Teyaric> Like, I know Ubisoft is rapacious, but is epic harassment-town as well?
[3:10:18] <Grandma_Amari> I know nothing about Fortnite except for one game I played of it over a year ago. Is Pat using a G.I. Joe skin or something?
[3:10:20] <%NoirePanzer> psaGib Suzi
[3:10:29] <%QueequegTheater> @ioriac Just give them time and a half for over 40 hours and nobody complains
[3:10:29] <%tigerspath> hi chat, I hope you are all doing well.
[3:10:33] <+ORGANizerC> @drtribal ur right, let's all get in a giant voice call with pat
[3:10:34] <$Dakuu75> @SoFarFetched @AzureGale @rumtumtugnutz @DedlokPM  damn, I see. Thanks.
[3:10:37] <%DedlokPM> @Grandma_Amari yes. Snake Eyes
[3:10:39] <MyNameIsRasus> ye that's a snake eyes skin
[3:10:39] <DetroitSentai> @Grandma_Amari yes its an official snakeyes skin
[3:10:41] <T_Sasquatch> Rapacious LUL man i learn new words every day
[3:10:42] <+ORGANizerC> instant succes
[3:10:44] <%za7az> People typically don't get banned here unless they're being exceptionally sketchy in my experience
[3:11:00] <@SoFarFetched> Or you just randomly go "That dog was bred to die" like that one guy geefCringe
[3:11:03] <eco419> PepeD
[3:11:05] <+glgzephyr> @SuicidalLemmming Dude, you can never know these days. Humans are sometimes just the worst, and it gets harder every day to give random strangers on the internet credit where it's not yet earned.
[3:11:08] <+DrTribal> @Grandma_Amari Yes. Fortnite got a Marvel-themed season and bought the entire world.
[3:11:08] <+BusterRepukken> i play R6 Siege, but i dont like what Ubisoft does
[3:11:12] <Kief_Meister> Yeah that guy was a cunt
[3:11:16] <%za7az> @SoFarFetched Yikes!
[3:11:20] <%captain_thickthighs> like we cant say the s word now right?
[3:11:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> What did this guy say?
[3:11:31] <%saladin1911> @suicidallemmming Everybody interprets text different. What is obvious to you will not be obvious to others. This can still happen when spoken but is far less of an issue
[3:11:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> Talk shit get hit boyo
[3:11:43] <%thelaxinator> Zangeif is the only dog I know that purrs
[3:11:50] <%thelaxinator> Either that or he snores while he's awake
[3:12:05] <ioriac> but do you think companies like epic and activion really want to have to pay for that? im not saying its a good idea to not pay but the industry trend is to not pay.
[3:12:07] <MyNameIsRasus> RELOAD
[3:12:11] <%GarbageNirvana> General rule of thumb would be "hey, if some random fuckwad came up to you on the street and said this how would you react"
[3:12:13] <Grandma_Amari> He's a bulldog, he's never not snoring
[3:12:16] <%MistyMntns> Zangeif is a pure precious bean that will smother Pat to Death.
[3:12:19] <TheSphereHunter> I was gonna ask if Pat saw "THE CUT" chatroom
[3:12:21] <@SoFarFetched> I mean its literally boiled down to,don't be an asshole. If Pat messed up on what you said,he apologizes.
[3:12:22] <dereksbales> @saladin1911 cool story
[3:12:25] <%captain_thickthighs> so it now 11 i wanna make johnny bread but not wake up the fam
[3:12:28] <JeysJumbleJams> i think most dogs with short muzzles just breathe-snort like that
[3:12:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Because at the end of the day we're all just random fuckwads
[3:12:38] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:12:43] <Brandon__Brando> cube pat busting sick moves
[3:12:49] <MyNameIsRasus> I don't think he saw snyder cut yet
[3:12:51] <noirxgwen> Pat and Suzi Fortmite stream! The day has been made.
[3:12:52] <+Starwarsguy_> @TheSphereHunter thats a good question
[3:13:12] <+glgzephyr> @captain_thickthighs sacrifice your family's sleep for food. I know the life, it's always the correct choice
[3:13:13] <T_Sasquatch> I saw like an hour. It's fine. Almost watchable
[3:13:14] <eco419> oh that Cut
[3:13:16] <%saladin1911> Oh god, I legitimately forgot that the Snyder Cut existed already
[3:13:16] <%TallPixels> Am i allowed to say I like the CUT here or no
[3:13:26] <%Nuclearcherries> Remember kids there is no ethical consumption under capitalism
[3:13:34] <ioriac> What Cut?
[3:13:34] <APB_Harleqyn> @TheSphereHunter The Cut as in the Meg Ryan movie from 2014?
[3:13:36] <T_Sasquatch> Its hard to fuck up a 4 hour movie
[3:13:43] <@SoFarFetched> Snyder Cut is what they are talking about.
[3:13:43] <+glgzephyr> you're allowed to like things
[3:13:50] <mortificent> JESUS

[3:14:06] <MyNameIsRasus> 2 SUZI 2 FURIOUS
[3:14:07] <JeysJumbleJams> @T_Sasquatch if it's 4 hours long i'd argue that qualifies as a fuck-up
[3:14:08] <+RushUnplugged> that's more cyberpunk than anything in cp77
[3:14:09] <%QueequegTheater> I liked BvS, doesn't mean it's good
[3:14:12] <%za7az> You guys match now!
[3:14:22] <%TheBensonator_> PatStaresAt Suzi Staring At Fortnite Fridays
[3:14:25] <%saladin1911> @tallpixels I like the Extended cut of BvS so you do you LUL
[3:14:27] <+DoktorZee> team edgelords!
[3:14:29] <+cahv123> Yeah that skin is nice.
[3:14:32] <%QueequegTheater> @JeysJumbleJams so the directors cut of Return of the King is a fuckup?
[3:14:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Gene just tweeted this about Outriders: "Ok I can’t get in lol back to monster Hunter. always online = always bad news"
[3:14:33] <RadShiro> A PRO FORTNITE GAMER? oh sht

[3:14:52] <+necrocannibal2> @patstaresat did you watch Godzilla vs Kong?
[3:14:53] <+glgzephyr> @TallPixels I like Sucker Punch, so I can't point fingers at anybody
[3:14:54] <%thelaxinator> RLM liked it, which shocked me
[3:14:54] <APB_Harleqyn> oooooooooooooh, THAT Cut, lol
[3:14:56] <+ORGANizerC> believe it or not it is tolerable
[3:15:02] <+TheotherKristian> I had more fun making fun of it with my brother
[3:15:05] <therealtacopancakes> it was better, still not good
[3:15:14] <%greasypete00> but hes a weirdo when directing apparently
[3:15:15] <%toastybites> He was on Man's stream
[3:15:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I just broiled cat fish!
[3:15:21] <%TallPixels> @saladin1911 It has its moments
[3:15:23] <crowspeak> That Owl movie he made was good
[3:15:26] <JeysJumbleJams> @QueequegTheater i've never seen a lord of the rings so idk, 3 hours is my limit for a theatre-intended experience
[3:15:28] <Paragon_Sheep> No because my dog's mouths are awful smelling
[3:15:28] <eco419> LUL
[3:15:32] <%Monkeyweed21> never forget he planned to make SuperCuck
[3:15:33] <ioriac> the guy sounds nice but his ideas are shit.
[3:15:34] <ullyzeez> hes loves ayn rand but other that that hes cool
[3:15:36] <%GarbageNirvana> He got in the biz as a music video director and everything he does speaks to those sensibilities

[3:15:40] <huskarl_zap> TOMATO TOWN
[3:15:41] <%thelaxinator> I'm gonna level with y'all, I thought the snyder cut was a re-release of Batman V Superman until the day it was released.
[3:15:41] <@Pandora_Prime> It's a better version of a mediocre action movie
[3:15:45] <+funya_rinpa> No one does that, Pat
[3:15:58] <%Monkeyweed21> ZOOM
[3:16:00] <T_Sasquatch> @monkeyweed21 super cuck ?
[3:16:03] <%saladin1911> @tallpixels Is Ben Affleck actually putting on a real performance in the Snyder Cut unlike the original release? LUL

[3:16:31] <+BusterRepukken> HE IS A GENIUS THO
[3:16:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Zack Snyder wanted Batman to cuck Superman and thats why Superman is evil in the Knighttmare future @T_Sasquatch
[3:16:38] <marklarphd> MonHun dropped last week and Pat is playing Fortnite? I'm scared
[3:16:40] <%GarbageNirvana> All I know is every time I see that trailer Batman's holding an assault rifle and it just...feels wrong

[3:18:02] <%saladin1911> @queequegtheater I legitimately think a decent bit of character dialogue in MGS3 is legitimately really good. Especially the codec calls.
[3:18:03] <switchbored505> Why are all the other players called Player[XXX]? Is that like a privacy setting?
[3:18:05] <%QueequegTheater> @Dakuu75 content creator

[3:18:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Dakuu75 Suzi likes Resident Evil more than Pat. And he was introduced to her through Clemps on twitter

[3:18:40] <bob900000> LUL
[3:18:42] <switchbored505> Cool
[3:18:44] <$RealThiele> he murdered one child and hes gone ravenous for innocent blood
[3:18:44] <%DedlokPM> @StrawberryPantsu He didn't die. People memed it up that he died because a news site put "(R.I.P)" after mentioning P.T. in a tweet about him leaving. The R.I.P. meant for the loss of P.T. but people of course misread it
[3:18:57] <$Dakuu75> <3
[3:18:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's more than 200 games in, probly no bots
[3:19:02] <megaminimechamocha> Just to clarify, I get that I fucked up with my comment earlier. I genuinely meant it as a joke but I know that Pat's relationship with chat jokes is different from Pat's relationship with closer friends and people who *can* make edgy jokes at Pat without causing problems. I thought I had been over the line, but clearly I was wrong. Love you, Pat.

[3:22:44] <+necrocannibal2> SAME
[3:22:46] <Vidyabum> yo enterprise isn't that bad either
[3:22:54] <VvTacoSaladvV> I'm rewatching next gen now
[3:22:54] <%thelaxinator> I like Enterprise, but that nu trek looks atrocious. Let that sink in.
[3:22:55] <theloganbrand> Lower Decks kinda slaps though
[3:22:57] <+necrocannibal2> FUCK NU STAR TREK
[3:23:01] <$RealThiele> enterprise theme song killed it in the cradle

[3:23:23] <Thepothero> Picard was not very good sadly coxThump
[3:23:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> but it's spread out over three seasons
[3:23:25] <+BusterRepukken> Mike Stoklasa forcing Rich Evans to watch star trek picard is great watching material
[3:23:27] <Manderfuzz> @rumtumtugnutz good an answer as any, I suppose. thanks!
[3:23:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Picard was bad?
[3:23:35] <frostyjay3> Newer Star Trek, Post Star Trek Beyond hurts my heart
[3:23:36] <+BusterRepukken> Picard is awful.
[3:23:37] <NitronStreams> i have literally rewatched ds9 like a dozen times and would still rather rewatch it that one of the new shows
[3:23:42] <Vidyabum> yeah picard is an abomination i think we all agree
[3:23:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Picard was dumb
[3:23:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt "Hey what if we took a setting defined by showing humanity at their absolute best, as a unified society working for the betterment of all, but instead we shove in a bunch of hamfisted diversity messages by making all the white guys into sexist assholes?"

[3:31:34] <%bassoontyphoon> Personally I don't get the big lady appeal either, but thats because im a biggay
[3:31:39] <Mattais88> As a fellow short person, I never have to worry about hitting my head on things
[3:31:39] <%dork_doggler> DO you have an NPC ally? I thought those were all trash
[3:31:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat is the Tyler1 meme
[3:31:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I wish I was still short

[3:32:12] <ioriac> @QueequegTheater yes yes it is.
[3:32:13] <Reanimator83> If someone fought pat would that be a hate crime to small people Kappa
[3:32:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> okay but consider: MASSIVE crazy goth milf
[3:32:44] <ioriac> @Reanimator83 hes not a dwarf so its not a hate crime
[3:32:53] <$Dakuu75> why are these docks dirty? Is it where all the stray cats go to take a shit?

[3:35:03] <eco419> YOINK
[3:35:08] <Sunstalker> Fooguwu That's just because Pat doesn't enable any fucking addons
[3:35:10] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @saladin1911 better hope none of them are here or you just played yourself
[3:35:13] <%Agami23> i dont get why people are assholes. its easier and more rewarding to not be an asshole
[3:35:15] <Brandon__Brando> ya I cant stand bad chats
[3:35:22] <BackflipCharm> I appreciate a streamer willing to ban idiots.
[3:35:31] <%QueequegTheater> @SoFarFetched Those big XPs are worth it below 70.  Above 70 just go do FATEs/CEs in Bozja
[3:35:48] <Sunstalker> Which sucks becayuse KasugaYeah is the best gif emote on the goddamn internet
[3:35:53] <+BusterRepukken> well when season 3 mando comes out, he';ll come back

[3:35:55] <s1rcuit> @BackflipCharm Pat doesn't ban often, but when he does it's earned
[3:35:56] <VvTacoSaladvV> the fomo is real

[3:36:01] <dumpster_garbage> who this new fork knife streamer? i see he has gied his hair red already
[3:36:06] <%captain_thickthighs> it'll be back next season of mando probably
[3:36:12] <ioriac> PAT for real Is it worth playing fortnight  in singles?
[3:36:17] <+glgzephyr> skins cycling out of availability is one of the worst things a game can have for me
[3:36:28] <%captain_thickthighs> yo imagine bill burr in fortnite
[3:36:33] <+BusterRepukken> Goku will totally appear
[3:36:34] <MyNameIsRasus> not YET
[3:36:34] <%SirGO0SE> GOKU PLS
[3:36:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Assholes are usually assholes because they got more positive/less negative reinforcement out of being one
[3:36:40] <T_Sasquatch> I really wish i got the triple threat female skin but it literally has never come back in years. If i got it years ago id probably play Fortnite
[3:36:42] <TheTwerkinator> give goku a GUN
[3:36:43] <munitalprats> VEGETA DEFAULT DANCING
[3:36:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Bill Burr skin when cowards
[3:36:45] <+glgzephyr> @ioriac Dude, if you're curious, play it yourself and make your own opinion.
[3:36:46] <chromonaut747> goku would do it
[3:36:47] <%ChestMimik> wow pat
[3:36:48] <+glgzephyr> it's free.
[3:36:48] <metrying> i want a drip vegeta skin
[3:36:48] <danraven> Goku with a gun
[3:36:51] <PleaseCallMeSugar> god please put goku in this fucking game, I NEED to see him shoot gun
[3:36:52] <%MechArch> all of the gokus
[3:36:54] <%Arazien> GUNKU
[3:36:57] <Sunstalker> Once that King of the Hill sequel is made, Hank Hill wuill be in fortnite :(
[3:36:57] <huskarl_zap> toriyama integrity intact
[3:36:58] <%AzureGale> ded
[3:36:58] <%VHGS> what if they put a functioning fusion dance in this game
[3:36:58] <+ChaosedStar> Goku shooting a gun will be worse than even ryu hahaha
[3:37:02] <rasamune> Shueisha might not play ball, honestly
[3:37:02] <eco419> BibleThump
[3:37:03] <metrying> i want to floss as drip vegeta bro
[3:37:05] <%za7az> I just broke 150000 channel points!

[3:37:18] <2DSuperiority> Attack on Titan did a crossover with some pubg mobile knockoff so why not
[3:37:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Goku: I may be out of ki... *pulls out glock* but i'm not outta options
[3:37:21] <IntenseNerdRage> One more once one more last one one more
[3:37:25] <+TheotherKristian> You and suzy have not met your child-bully count
[3:37:30] <%bassoontyphoon> what would be the most inappropriate IP for them to add to the game??
[3:37:31] <%saladin1911> Goku drove a car. He's down
[3:37:32] <munitalprats> my favorite image is Ryu holding a gun over Chun li's down body and the question "is this oki?"
[3:37:33] <%Agami23> its not as bad as a xenomorph
[3:37:34] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:37:34] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt you tap someone on the shoulder with a pistol shot and they build a 4 story hotel with furniture LMAO
[3:37:34] <+glgzephyr> I've already seen Goku with a gun, that's old shit
[3:37:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Either Toriyama or Shueisha wouldn't let that happen
[3:37:37] <%captain_thickthighs> i want bill burr fortnite skin
[3:37:38] <%ChestMimik> Goku would totally be down to use weapons under the right context
[3:37:38] <ThirdPersonPhil> Goku is a pro at getting shot since he was a kid
[3:37:40] <JeysJumbleJams> it'd be funnier
[3:37:42] <%MechArch> goku has energy guns
[3:37:44] <NitronStreams> Vegeta with a gun is just Shadow the Hedgehog
[3:37:45] <%legend_of_nolan> Goku would throw out a medkit for the last gun fight
[3:37:45] <Link232> Goku would probably be a hero character like Thanos was
[3:37:45] <@SoFarFetched> @QueequegTheater its for moogle tomes and Im only in HW currently. Its the only run I dont have to worry about people not remembering how to do mechanics and I can at least get up and do stuff.
[3:37:45] <%SirGO0SE> Goku driving a car was the best
[3:37:47] <ShaneOcelot> I mean Batman was in this game and it's way weirder for him to shoot guns than Goku
[3:37:47] <rasamune> Goku would default dance for sure, though
[3:37:49] <eco419> oh dude
[3:37:51] <+DOLLACROSSBILL> give me Ryo Hazuki
[3:37:51] <Sunstalker> bassoontyphoon Punisher?
[3:37:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Its like a Ki Blast with a bullet
[3:37:52] <Sypheck> give me pink shirt Vegeta and I'll play this fftbgEmpowered
[3:37:53] <+BusterRepukken> Ryu aiming a shotgun at a kid 'block this fucking overhead'
[3:37:57] <%Boxortoo> Ryu doing tiktok dances is so cursed
[3:38:00] <%BoxNavy> ryu met stan from american dad
[3:38:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> The firs thing that happen in dragon ball is that Bulma unloads a handgun on him
[3:38:02] <+glgzephyr> look at you queuing up for another game LUL
[3:38:06] <huskarl_zap> Ryeyu is big sellout bich
[3:38:06] <%TallPixels> Goku: "I'll let him drink the chugjug so i can fight him at his best"
[3:38:08] <%Agami23> add white mage from mario basketball
[3:38:09] <rasamune> Goku would see the default dance once and do it better than anyone has ever done it
[3:38:09] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[3:38:10] <theloganbrand> Ryu will be in Mario Kart someday
[3:38:12] <+polothegreatest> batman shot rubber bullets, not lethal

[3:43:33] <+D00msDayDan> when's fortnite getting automation
[3:43:33] <OzzySnek> woah playing this game with a gamepad. kinda wild. i bet it plays super well tho
[3:43:38] <%MisterRockett> Pat has mostly played popular new thing since he started streaming fulltime.
[3:43:38] <%thelaxinator> I still prefer factorio, building in satisfactory is tiresome in it's execution.
[3:43:38] <+ChaosedStar> I wish i could unlock SOMETHING cool as a ftp in fortnite at least.
[3:43:43] <Mr_Ease> "how dare you play the popular thing now go back to playing FF14, the super popular MMO"
[3:43:44] <%TheBensonator_> WE GOTTA
[3:43:45] <%GarbageNirvana> And then Kenshi tricked you
[3:43:49] <BackflipCharm> It's ok to hate Fortnite culture or whatever, but the game itself is allowed to be fun
[3:43:50] <rasamune> @Monkeyweed21 I was gonna say, in what world
[3:43:52] <%DedlokPM> "I love popular things. Except the bands that you like. They all suck." PatStaresAt
[3:43:55] <+glgzephyr> do the shield potions not heal past 50?
[3:43:58] <+SolidusSlig> it's just the meme at this point. like undertale the games fun it's just the internet has memed it into oblivion
[3:43:59] <ioriac> this game has money and more money and it was second one to jump on the battle royal wagon
[3:44:00] <+polothegreatest> get into fortnite just to play mando playing the banjo
[3:44:04] <%blistexthief> factorio's great, that's what's up with it
[3:44:11] <Berendenn> The only real problem is becomes an all consuming thing to some people and SUPER annoying in some cases
[3:44:14] <+DinnerCalzone> WE GOT A
[3:44:14] <SomeOtherNeb> @Mr_Ease did you know the free trial now includes Heavensward?
[3:44:15] <%ChestMimik> THE AI APP THING IS HORROR INCARNATE
[3:44:17] <%QueequegTheater> Good old deepfakes
[3:44:27] <%TheBensonator_> You mean you DON'T like a freakish Obama face singing Chug Jug? Noooooooo
[3:44:28] <%TallPixels> we gotta-
[3:44:36] <ShaneOcelot> it's a bop
[3:44:37] <+necrocannibal2> have you seen that AI nude thing?
[3:44:40] <$Reaped_Psyche> I appreciate that Pat appreciates the #1 Victory Royal kid.
[3:44:40] <%Arazien> You heard it here first chat. Pat thinks Weird Al is a thief
[3:44:41] <%ChestMimik> THE JELLO MONSTER WILL STEAL YOUR FACE AND SING TICTOC MEMES
[3:44:41] <%MisterRockett> I DO NOT believe it was actually written by a child.
[3:44:48] <+glgzephyr> this feels like THAT apartment complex in PUBG
[3:44:48] <Mr_Ease> wait is there a pat version of chug jug
[3:44:49] <ShaneOcelot> Pat that's what a song parody is
[3:44:50] <%thelaxinator> The deepfake singing gifs is basically like staring into the first chapter of a sci-fi horror novel
[3:44:53] <Berendenn> you ever have to deal with the 7 year olds that will absolutely never stop talking about fortnite, its awful
[3:44:58] <%Monkeyweed21> HOW BOUT THAT APEX HUH
[3:45:00] <ullyzeez> its called a "parody" its not stealing
[3:45:01] <WoodmanDotEXE> Dark Souls demake looking great
[3:45:02] <%TheLemuroid> I for one welcome our new Fortnite overlords
[3:45:04] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it wasn't, it was written by a young adult and performed with a voice filter
[3:45:11] <jorniev> APEX guys SALT INCREASING
[3:45:13] <+polothegreatest> down
[3:45:15] <%QueequegTheater> I wonder if the pornstars getting their faces written over feel more annoyed than the celebrities being shopped into the porn
[3:45:22] <rasamune> The wombo dot ai thing creeps me out a lot because I KNOW that site is just being used to train a deepfake algorithm to make convincing fake recordings
[3:45:24] <ShaneOcelot> also it's unironically better than the original tbf
[3:45:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> is the power of the bow, just that people can't tell as easily where you are?  (assuming you don't miss)\
[3:45:28] <+polothegreatest> below the stairs
[3:45:30] <crowspeak> Should remind people that 90s game journalist hated Pokemon because it was popular with kids
[3:45:45] <PleaseCallMeSugar> okay I like the melodic tones to tell you about breakage progress but I still HATE how shit JIGGLES god that's unsettling as shit
[3:45:47] <+glgzephyr> it was right there LUL
[3:45:48] <Aydarkzero> of course
[3:45:50] <%saladin1911> Deepfake is a horrifying technology. Like, the shit this is going to be capable and associate with will be fucked up.
[3:45:52] <%thelaxinator> God I just realized this game has Red Faction's deconstruction system but done 1000% better.
[3:46:09] <ioriac> @jorniev hey man i like apex but its really not as kid/ normey freindly as this is.
[3:46:12] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I give it 5 years before a deepfake collapses a government
[3:46:16] <Hyperfludd> is that snakeyes lol
[3:46:27] <jorniev> @jorniev HA
[3:46:30] <huskarl_zap> Rye yu killed peelie and pat cried for daigo
[3:46:33] <%QueequegTheater> @crowspeak Legitimate journalism died with Walter Cronkite, why would gaming journalism be any better
[3:46:36] <%GarbageNirvana> The fact that deepfake hasn't been outlawed yet to me is astounding
[3:46:41] <Aydarkzero> that was some destiny aim assist LUL
[3:46:42] <%ChestMimik> @PleaseCallMeSugar I give it seven before it starts RUNNING one

[3:47:37] <huskarl_zap> yes
[3:47:38] <%QueequegTheater> @bassoontyphoon so is making piracy illegal but they still try
[3:47:40] <Clu_Flynn> has Pat tamed a raptor yet?
[3:47:41] <SomeOtherNeb> @ioriac ty ty
[3:47:41] <rasamune> @monkeydog57 from time to time
[3:47:43] <%MisterRockett> I died cause someone aggro'd one of these things and I killed him while he was fighting them and didn't realize what they WHERE so someone was able to kill me as I was realizing what they were and running away.
[3:47:54] <WoodmanDotEXE> Pat's a fortnite streamer until Outriders is fixed enough to be an Outriders streamer
[3:47:54] <Clu_Flynn> Pat tame a dino PowerUpL HahaReindeer PowerUpR

[3:48:13] <usoto215> Pat loves Fortnite, what a time to be alivce
[3:48:14] <%Cozy90> pat saying the names of the loactions in the game makes me laugh a little

[3:48:56] <%TallPixels> dammnn
[3:49:04] <%ChestMimik> @thelaxinator The underlying tech is mostly pretty simple. It's mostly about time and processing power
[3:49:05] <Berendenn> MURDER THE CHILDS
[3:49:05] <%Agami23> their building up their fortnite defenses and pat just casually walks past them
[3:49:08] <Kaleidoscope_Misfortune> POGGERS

[3:49:49] <SomeOtherNeb> @BusterRepukken AS IT SHOULD
[3:49:54] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hey pat is Cronus Lux worth the grind now or should I focus on Bozja
[3:50:02] <%ChestMimik> Tomato Town deserved it
[3:50:02] <s1rcuit> considering just touching the stuff still works, does it really matter?
[3:50:03] <%bassoontyphoon> gett fuuuucked
[3:50:05] <%captain_thickthighs> they build like chinese build codes
[3:50:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> Its a cleaver animation trick too, so you can have a variety of head types use the same drinking animation
[3:50:14] <+glgzephyr> how dare he try to play this game!
[3:50:34] <Sypheck> nice bronze plays from these kids khalaCreep
[3:50:41] <%thelaxinator> @QueequegTheater cronus lux is a pretty chill grind, it's mostly just a lot of poetics from dailies. Still looks really distinctive.
[3:50:47] <+BusterRepukken> id like apex alot more but its so buggy.
[3:51:10] <%ChestMimik> I'm still mad Apex ate Titanfall 3
[3:51:11] <%TallPixels> you picked up the ammo
[3:51:20] <PleaseCallMeSugar> I'd like Apex but it runs like absolute trash on my system for no discernible reason
[3:51:31] <KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Now you have a friend to play Apex with! Alternate on Fridays with Fornite and Apex
[3:51:32] <%QueequegTheater> @thelaxinator I got through DR, do I have to beat DRS for the final relic augment or just grind out DR normal a bunch
[3:51:36] <+BusterRepukken> my friend streams Apex sometimes but it runs like shit and he gets d.c'ed all the time.
[3:51:36] <Brandon__Brando> tlove apex but the skins are ass
[3:51:40] <+TheotherKristian> Why can't Respawn just use the Apex money to make titatnfall 3?
[3:51:42] <%blistexthief> Being a coward is always the answer
[3:51:42] <generalve> suzi ?
[3:51:43] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like it was either Apex ate Titanfall 3 or EA ate Respawn, so

[3:51:51] <%TallPixels> Kars
[3:51:52] <%QueequegTheater> @generalve ye
[3:51:53] <+Das_Prints> The closest you can do in Apex is queuing no fill so you have no teams and queueing in duos. Trying to do that in trios is really damn hard
[3:51:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> I think Apex is buggier on PC. I don't get many issues on PS4
[3:51:54] <%Agami23> i like cahs
[3:51:56] <Finakala> @QueequegTheater Savage is optional, not needed for relic progress
[3:51:56] <generalve> wait..

[3:52:13] <%saladin1911> The Apex skins are all boring as shit, this is true.
[3:52:13] <s1rcuit> @Brandon__Brando agreed, the hairstyles are also garbage

[3:54:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt ?
[3:54:48] <ThirdPersonPhil> It was basically that scene from Twin peaks season 3
[3:54:52] <%Reaped_Psyche> Reaped_Psyche subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 90% of the reason I was never interested in Fortnight is because no one I respect ever played it.  How times have changed.  LUL
[3:54:54] <%Cozy90> Suzy "I love running over children"
[3:54:56] <+necrocannibal2> you two going to play Apex?

[3:55:51] <%blistexthief> Your prom date, you ugly sack of shit
[3:55:52] <+BusterRepukken> yes DmC, the best one of the series.
[3:55:53] <armchairmaster_> Be sure to check out SuziSphereHunter on all the medias, she hunts all spherical objects.
[3:55:55] <+Conzanagi> Still wild to me that Pat is playing this
[3:55:58] <PleaseCallMeSugar> she hunts spheres, but she may be confused here - pat's orb is not a sphere
[3:55:59] <xpakeo> im excited for the DMC one
[3:55:59] <+Das_Prints> That DmC breakdown will be interesting.
