[0:38:11] <$SGrim> @InugamiTheHound except that one guy he threw into machinegun fire in 1.
[0:38:18] <%mayorrev> is there a certain point where nobody will pick a fight with kiryu because he's so big and strong
[0:38:21] <PabuPanda> Turning someone into a vegetable isn't technically killing.
[0:38:23] <$shurtal> are we gonna see kiryu totally kill that guy tonight?
[0:38:25] <%crimsonharvest> Kiwami is an acronym for the full name of kiryu insurance
[0:38:28] <%mayorrev> or will people always attack
[0:38:30] <$ssamjangg> All offensive, no defense pls
[0:38:31] <%lewdskeletor13> You need Kiryu Insurance

[1:00:34] <%hawk_rush> MURDER
[1:00:34] <CookieCutter007> MUDDA
[1:00:36] <artoflec> the later substories are better and way more involved, one is new i think? and elaborates a point of the main story @AngriestPat
[1:00:37] <AMajorTom> That was the hardest way to catch that
[1:00:37] <%joylent_blue> MUDA-DA
[1:00:38] <xeros720> if it makes them feel better, he's not gonna be a cop for long
[1:00:39] <thelonechris> Beat up that 60 year old

[1:00:49] <%SaltyDongs> no
[1:00:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> never too old for beatdowns
[1:00:51] <hntronium> Never too old Pat
[1:00:53] <%Starlight_Gamer> I thought the homeless were kiryu's friends?
[1:00:53] <studleydoorite> he's young and criminal at heart
[1:00:54] <gunzerkingdunce> Kiryu fights well into his 50's
[1:00:54] <+PenmanLupine> not when your only food for the day is a 40 oz
[1:00:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wood sword holding homelesses
[1:00:57] <%MakotoPB> someone can become homeless after losing their long time job
[1:00:59] <%Solidnick18> Yakuza 6 is real good
[1:01:01] <%mayorrev> SourPls

[1:01:08] <%TheSpiritof2277> Yakuza 6 is so fucking good
[1:01:08] <%Niney_Who> 6
[1:01:10] <CookieCutter007> PogChamp fis of the north star
[1:01:10] <CalderGaming> no 5?
[1:01:11] <WaxWitch> 6
[1:01:12] <%reiju_22> 6 before 2?
[1:01:12] <+UnderageBat> YEYEYE more Yakuza streams PogChamp
[1:01:12] <%CerberusDriver> 6 is good
[1:01:12] <+Weeewer> I am trying to go in order
[1:01:13] <Nighthawkmun> Fist it
[1:01:14] <+HellCopter> FotNS isn't that interesting
[1:01:15] <ScrivenerJeff> Goddam did I get emotional with 6.
[1:01:16] <frogurtz> Judgement?
[1:01:19] <%frontlinecaster> Do Kiwami 2!!!
[1:01:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'd say Yakuza 6
[1:01:20] <MSN04_Sazabi> Kiwami 2?
[1:01:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Thats right pat beat the poor
[1:01:21] <%TheSpiritof2277> Please do 6
[1:01:22] <InugamiTheHound> what kiwami 2?
[1:01:22] <%CerberusDriver> 6 is super emotional
[1:01:24] <%Niney_Who> The Lost Paradise one isn't amazing tbh
[1:01:25] <$Plutt_bug> NORTH STAR
[1:01:26] <%Solidnick18> Judgement isn't out yet
[1:01:26] <%Niney_Who> 6 is Great though
[1:01:27] <%st4rrytea> fist of the north star yeyeye
[1:01:28] <+mgskomododragon> Oooooo FotNS. i wanna see ken
[1:01:30] <flame_of_udun_> KIWAMI 2 THO
[1:01:32] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I miss Red Heat
[1:01:33] <+chronopaladin> pat's new jutsu
[1:01:33] <+zaworldo> DOES the music still change per style
[1:01:35] <PabuPanda> Could always do 5 once the remaster comes out
[1:01:43] <dragoon001914> FotNS is worth doing because the minigames with Kenshiro are pretty amusing.
[1:01:44] <%SrG00SE> Protect yourselves so I can hurt you dammit
[1:01:45] <+JayZeli> PS4 or PC?
[1:01:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Look at pat killing the poor masses
[1:01:47] <%Solidnick18> fist of north star is also good feels great
[1:01:49] <roflwaffleauthoritah> It's best to do 6 before 2 because Kiwami 2 improves a lot on the systems in 6
[1:01:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Fist of the North Star one isn't too special
[1:01:51] <Polengoldur> @st4rrytea no, its "fist of the north star ATATATATATAT
[1:02:01] <ScrivenerJeff> I wonder if they'll ever bring over that one side game that was set in feudal times?
[1:02:05] <ScrivenerJeff> Or am I dreaming that?
[1:02:13] <Run44forrest> probably not
[1:02:13] <%bread_assassin> Do 6 first. 6 and Kiwami 2 are pretty similar gameplay-wise, so you might get burned out doing them back-to-back.
[1:02:13] <%Niney_Who> Pat does this count as Littering?
[1:02:14] <%simulationbard> Why do these homeless dudes have swords?
[1:02:16] <majindusto> FUCK OFF! FOTNS is GREAT!!!
[1:02:16] <alexandrecau> fist of north star has you hunting a shoulder pad thief
[1:02:18] <jobbedbone> feudal japan is the worst setting

[1:02:38] <%CerberusDriver> Games that let you taunt are the best
[1:02:40] <ScrivenerJeff> Only ones I haven't touched.
[1:02:42] <majindusto> I WANT ISHIN!!!
[1:02:46] <xeros720> they'd need to remake it or port to ps4 for them to consider it
[1:02:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Too bad, I want to use a katana
[1:02:48] <%RaikenTB> the HD remaster for ps3 was great.

[1:03:32] <bustawof> maji boy!
[1:03:35] <%Solidnick18> Majima is the best
[1:03:35] <gustavozxd> I heard it's because of not only the characters that are based on historical figures the west doesn't know about and also there's heavy themes of rape (or so I heard)
[1:03:36] <%kiiiirsten> BREAKING ZE LAAAWWW
[1:03:36] <%violetheart> What's a majima?
[1:03:36] <$nademonkey1100> MAJIMA EVRY WERE

[1:04:00] <+HellCopter> Majima please be less everywhere
[1:04:03] <%Aitch971> listen to this sick ass panic theme
[1:04:06] <vergil_angelo> @AngriestPat After you finish this up, go back to Purgatory to meet Komaki and learn some skills for Dragon style
[1:04:08] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat There's a hilarious retcon involving Majima at the end of the game
[1:04:11] <alexandrecau> this is weird because they didn't change majima's cutscene where he is clearly more evil
[1:04:15] <dekkitout> Batting Cages! Gotta find the Batting Cages!
[1:04:18] <%galaxyswirl> IT IS TIME FOR everywhere!
[1:04:22] <+Weeewer> Nah
[1:04:23] <%Blankets_and_Tea> @AngriestPat not in the slightest
[1:04:24] <ScrivenerJeff> If you liked these games a lot then you should totally watch the Battles without Honor or Humanity flicks. THey're so damn good.
[1:04:24] <$Plutt_bug> sure @AngriestPat
[1:04:25] <+HellCopter> Nope
[1:04:25] <%frontlinecaster> Nah
[1:04:25] <Run44forrest> doesnt majima get fucking shot in this one
[1:04:26] <%galaxyswirl> HELL NO
[1:04:26] <%Niney_Who> No
[1:04:26] <Deano8817> majima everywhere does that for ya
[1:04:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> Not necessarily
[1:04:27] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat How long until we get an RE2 mod that makes Leon into Kiryu and Mr X into Majima?
[1:04:27] <alexandrecau> oh no you'll be max way earlier
[1:04:28] <%PalmtopNami> not at all
[1:04:28] <artoflec> To max out the dragon style you have to do every majima everywhere thing
[1:04:28] <colzack_> nope
[1:04:29] <+Weeewer> Majima starts giving insane EXP
[1:04:30] <%LethargicRush> HURRY TO HARUKA
[1:04:30] <%EdgyMacaroon> no only majima
[1:04:31] <%Solidnick18> you can if you want
[1:04:33] <%LethargicRush> but first have a nice dinner
[1:04:34] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Getting tiger drop from komaki asap is the best thing to do
[1:04:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> When I did this in my game I ran into Majima on my way to the cages.
[1:04:37] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat if you want the secret boss you want every side quest
[1:04:37] <Soapydishwater> Yakuza has so much great music that is used for like 10 seconds in one scene
[1:04:37] <%PalmtopNami> you can do none and still max out.
[1:04:38] <%frontlinecaster> I got pretty close to maxing out just doing the side stories and some arena fights
[1:04:38] <$nademonkey1100> gotta save a kid BUT FIRST FOOD
[1:04:40] <gunzerkingdunce> Majima drips xp
[1:04:42] <+Gohyakuen> need to complete all the majima everywhere system
[1:04:42] <unstablebeast19> MAJIMA everywhere adds a ton of exp
[1:04:43] <ScrivenerJeff> I think it was after uh.. four came out.. I went on a binge ..damn they're so friggin good
[1:04:43] <Loarfy> this batting cage part kicked my ass hard
[1:04:44] <xeros720> you're forced to grind Majima enough that it isn't an issue
[1:04:44] <CookieCutter007> cheap ass sirloin

[1:05:41] <%frontlinecaster> @Niney_Who I did that too somewhat. Not quite this early, but I was max level a few chapters before the end because I grind obsessively

[1:06:50] <inz0mbiac> LAUGH you stupid MUTHAFUCKA
[1:06:50] <$shurtal> is Kiryu totally gonna kill a guy?
[1:06:51] <%Yum438> This fight was also SUPER TOUGH when I first played Yakuza 1
[1:06:54] <%frontlinecaster> I love you so much Majima
[1:06:55] <StooEsq> "Wait, why is he going to the batting ca-Oh."

[1:07:08] <InugamiTheHound> in yakuza 0 majima and kiryu never meet each other
[1:07:11] <unstablebeast19> but not as tough as yakuza 2s kiryu head
[1:07:11] <%yeknomlive> he kept the shoes
[1:07:12] <%Solidnick18> KIRYUU CHAN
[1:07:12] <%frontlinecaster> Majima's intro in Kiwami 2 in the arena is so good
[1:07:13] <thelonechris> There's that boi
[1:07:15] <CalderGaming> @Zombrocom judge eyes is Yakuza But With A Disgraced Lawyer-Turned-Detective in the Yakuza universe by the same devs
[1:07:17] <%frontlinecaster> Kiryu-chan!

[1:07:17] <%Remery_> Fat Joe?
[1:07:17] <reonome> KIRYU CHAN
[1:07:18] <$ssamjangg> what is this one piece character
[1:07:18] <%hawk_rush> KIRYU-CHAN
[1:07:18] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat Given that Judge Eyes takes place in Kamarocho after the events of 6. You probably want to have 6, done by then.
[1:07:18] <gustavozxd> majima was kind of a jobber in the first game
[1:07:19] <gunzerkingdunce> "Laugh motherfucker laugh!"
[1:07:21] <%Niney_Who> @frontlinecaster Same. But since I missed the Encounter Finder for Kiryu I have a harder time finding Shakedowns. So I gotta have less fun waiting for the real estate to refill
[1:07:22] <KaptainKappathe5th> *NOW*

[1:08:16] <%rdark_ksu> guns, exist
[1:08:17] <ScreamingMeat> I doubt thay would kill anyone but knck em out, probably
[1:08:18] <$cureneckbeard> nyannLul
[1:08:20] <gustavozxd> the existence of Yakuza 0 makes this scene make even less sense
[1:08:20] <ScrivenerJeff> Murder indiscrimnately.. look fly.. be great at karaoke.
[1:08:22] <Run44forrest> the haruka closet
[1:08:22] <$Plutt_bug> Pause the stream i have to leave
[1:08:22] <ScrivenerJeff> What can't this guy do?
[1:08:24] <%Solidnick18> Seriously serious
[1:08:25] <+zaworldo> the KNIFE
[1:08:26] <%Chatterbox1991> the idea that Majima would lay a finger on Haruka after what happened to Makoto is ridiculus
[1:08:27] <+ArcLifth> That dude is dead
[1:08:31] <artoflec> this fight is fucked up on hard
[1:08:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> Stick him with your blade Majima
[1:08:34] <%frontlinecaster> I still miss Majima's long hair from Zero though :( :(
[1:08:34] <%Solidnick18> Shank em
[1:08:41] <gunzerkingdunce> @rexenexus Mark doesnt even remember voicing Majima
[1:08:41] <%Prism_Wing> Man, real oreos taste like shit compared to bootleg oreos.
[1:08:41] <OhioNitsud> draw me like one of your french girls Majima
[1:08:44] <Run44forrest> ok but what if majima had 2 knifes
[1:08:46] <%kiiiirsten> @frontlinecaster Zero Majima is my baby daddy
[1:08:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Run44forrest That'd be pretty great
[1:08:54] <%Solidnick18> Hit it boyz
[1:08:56] <+MechaBaphomet> What if he had no eyes?
[1:08:58] <%frontlinecaster> @kiiiirsten Zero Majima gives me feelings
[1:08:58] <$Plutt_bug> Majima's biggest enemy is the dreaded Depth
[1:08:58] <Caidezes> Majima makes no sense after 0 because we know he's not actually crazy.
[1:09:00] <%Solidnick18> that's the laugh
[1:09:01] <%RaikenTB> that laugh LUL
[1:09:01] <%SaltyDongs> damn
[1:09:02] <weontheultralightbeam> majima should just get a gun
[1:09:02] <frogurtz> I still really like slugger Majima.
[1:09:03] <+zaworldo> llook at him guard dashing everywhere
[1:09:04] <+d00msdaydan> how did losing an eye make him weaker? is it like a sharingan?
[1:09:04] <alexandrecau> is he stronger than saejima though?
[1:09:05] <%ToneBacas> a knife for an eye
[1:09:06] <$NocturneNovember> And it's the same knife that took his eye, right?
[1:09:06] <$Jedted> Man, Yakuza 0 really messed Majima up! PogChamp
[1:09:07] <CalderGaming> that super armor
[1:09:09] <starotter70> @MechaBaphomet Two Knives
[1:09:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> @MechaBaphomet Unlimited Knife Works
[1:09:13] <%mimikyu92> @MechaBaphomet he'd need TWO KNIVES
[1:09:13] <%mayorrev> Hamill just joker's it up as majima yea?
[1:09:14] <Prevot> what if majima had two knives and no eyes
[1:09:15] <reonome> majima everywhere
[1:09:15] <%TheSpiritof2277> Slugger Majima is broken af tho in 0
[1:09:16] <raveous> majima needs to do some alchemy, get his eye back
[1:09:20] <Soapydishwater> @MechaBaphomet Then he would get maximum strong, blindness is a buff in anime
[1:09:21] <Tomschiii> nah, he just wants to be nishtani
[1:09:23] <%Das_Bass> he went super crazy after 0
[1:09:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima was great in 0
[1:09:27] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Majima must go all out...... just this once
[1:09:27] <%frontlinecaster> Slugger Majima in Zero was so fucking powerfu
[1:09:27] <%kiiiirsten> slice
[1:09:30] <VRNK> majima can you chill with the flashstepping when kiryu isnt even looking at you
[1:09:36] <%frontlinecaster> I still need to go back and do Majima's chapters in Kiwami 2
[1:09:38] <+theobble> 4Head

[1:09:42] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> majima usin darkslayer
[1:09:42] <%Nobrev> @Caidezes you see at the end of the game that the trauma he went through all of zero drove him nuts
[1:09:42] <%riantDeliration> what if majima could do the counter-stab
[1:09:43] <%maskedriderhero> he's not crazy, but he does want to live however he wants
[1:09:44] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Weeewer)
[1:09:45] <$Plutt_bug> dinky ass bat beaTs
[1:09:47] <+zaworldo> When dragon?
[1:09:50] <unstablebeast19> I always think noth at their best kiryu wo uild beat majima just cuz it's take a bit more to put him down
[1:09:51] <benjiFG> unf this music
[1:09:52] <Polengoldur> remember everyone: majima is just pretending t o be crazy
[1:09:53] <%Niney_Who> If only your Dragon wasn't garbage
[1:09:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> @frontlinecaster They're short and sweet
[1:09:54] <Deano8817> majima's craziness is like a weird half way point in pretending and being actual crazy
[1:09:55] <%Niney_Who> It'd be great for this
[1:09:56] <$SGrim> Goro Majima with both eyes and a Knife is an unstoppable force of nature on par with Shaggy Blanco. PogChamp
[1:09:56] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Abuse dem heat drinks for heat moves
[1:09:57] <circular7> thug style on majima is still really strong
[1:09:57] <dekkitout> He- he's fast! monkaS
[1:09:59] <+MechaBaphomet> TAKE HIS OTHER EYE zoneRage zoneBork
[1:10:01] <%frontlinecaster> I miss Kiryu's Beast Mode trainer
[1:10:02] <+theobble> FeelsGoodMan majima
[1:10:03] <gunzerkingdunce> No tiger drop yet
[1:10:04] <%frontlinecaster> She ruled
[1:10:05] <$cureneckbeard> Is Majima teleporting or just moving really fast
[1:10:10] <alexandrecau> majima is crazy, fucker has been tortured for a whole year, he is just lying to himself
[1:10:10] <$ssamjangg> rush is so cool
[1:10:11] <%laserbeaming> Dragon sucks for like 89% of the game
[1:10:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> is Kiwami 2 on Steam yet? I don't trust the PS4 hardware to do it justice
[1:10:11] <%SpamKingRathalos> Majima over there quick boosting and shit
[1:10:12] <dekkitout> Both?
[1:10:19] <+JackMillerTime> man majimas got style, if i ever find a coat like that im wearing it all the time
[1:10:20] <gustavozxd> "majima is just pretending" is the lamest retcon ever
[1:10:28] <gunzerkingdunce> Ok guys, Majima with the stone mask
[1:10:31] <%Solidnick18> Mad dog
[1:10:35] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s not pretending
[1:10:35] <InugamiTheHound> didn't maxima take the fall for his Saejima but it turns out his Saejima never killed anyone because of rubber bullets
[1:10:38] <%HentaiSenpai9K> I always wished the Yakuzza characters haf actual powers/abilities in the story not just the fights
[1:10:43] <%laserbeaming> I like how grunts have names, but we don't care about them.
[1:10:45] <Caidezes> @Nobrev Except he was acting pretty normal even during the final cutscenes in 0. It's only in the final few seconds that he acts crazy for no reason.
[1:10:49] <alexandrecau> he ain't pretending shit even in 0 komaki point out he is just holding back the crazy in him
[1:10:50] <Run44forrest> kanno is the guy who didnt laugh
[1:10:52] <$NocturneNovember> @gunzerkingdunce so nothing changes?
[1:10:54] <%Shikari21> its not that hes pretending exactly its just he doesnt really care anymore is is trying to be more like nishitani
[1:10:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> @InugamiTheHound No way. That'd be STUPID...
[1:10:59] <$ssamjangg> taunt gives you energy?
[1:11:06] <$SGrim> @gustavozxd I never took that as him pretending. I took it as him being deeply emotionally broken. Still a retcon, but slightly more interesting.
[1:11:07] <%maskedriderhero> Hes not pretending, he's living how he wants. He doesn't have to be crazy to act zany
[1:11:07] <%AdmiralButtloaf> reminds me of a podcast where matt and woolie discussed knife vs. bats in a fight
[1:11:08] <%frontlinecaster> Nishitani was such a good character
[1:11:08] <gunzerkingdunce> @nocturnenovember true
[1:11:10] <+zaworldo> WHEN DRAGON
[1:11:10] <%LethargicRush> and to think he got his mad dog style because he was the best host club owner
[1:11:15] <xtremegamer80> What was Kiryu grabbing there?
[1:11:16] <frogurtz> I still want a Yakuza 0-2.
[1:11:18] <%kiiiirsten> @InugamiTheHound correct
[1:11:19] <gunzerkingdunce> He uses it whenever
[1:11:24] <%NWR_James> GET HIM MAJIMA
[1:11:25] <%Solidnick18> love that majima combo
[1:11:26] <%EdgyMacaroon> No he uses it alot
[1:11:27] <+Gohyakuen> CRAZY TALK
[1:11:29] <%frontlinecaster> I think he mainly uses it on the rank up fights?
[1:11:34] <%HentaiSenpai9K> @frogurtz That's YAKUZA 1 😂
[1:11:34] <alexandrecau> nishitani was just what majima was before 4
[1:11:36] <%Das_Bass> I think I saw him use it a lot in the ranks over B
[1:11:39] <PontiusPyrite> give me yakuza -1, let me play as kazama
[1:11:39] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:11:43] <%yeknomlive> i love that

[1:19:35] <$NocturneNovember> I saw some screenshots from an interview with Kiryu's VA about how all the Yakuza fans in France are male bodybuilders and it reinforced my love for the fanbase LUL
[1:19:35] <EnderGamma> Did you see you can buy Nier Automata SHOES now?

[1:19:55] <%kiiiirsten> @ElenaManetta Scarily accurate
[1:19:56] <Deano8817> Nishiki's kinda bad at this yakuza leading stuff aint he?

[1:20:02] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Nandesuka
[1:20:03] <$ssamjangg> fuzakenna
[1:20:06] <%frontlinecaster> This whole story is Nishiki being a fuckboi
[1:20:07] <%kiiiirsten> You mean The 80's?
[1:20:07] <Run44forrest> ok but is he worse thank kiryu
[1:20:09] <%lewdskeletor13> These Nishki flashbacks add a lot to his character
[1:20:12] <gunzerkingdunce> @frontlinecaster yeeee, slicks his hair back with BLOOOOD
[1:20:14] <agadejobi> That was Yakuza Zero!
[1:20:14] <%ECRead> @EnderGamma I DID. I'm buying both. for reasons.
[1:20:15] <flame_of_udun_> Nishiki is a weenie
[1:20:16] <%frontlinecaster> He clearly doesn't
[1:20:18] <dekkitout> Respect . exe cannot be found
[1:20:19] <Fujiwara_92> fuck respect, i want money

[1:20:26] <$Plutt_bug> TIMM-EH
[1:20:28] <$Quack_of_Dawn> You used to be able to just show a briefcase of money to a place and just own it, now you've gotta be cutthroat
[1:20:28] <%frontlinecaster> @gunzerkingdunce Apparently I need to try that, it never moves
[1:20:32] <Deano8817> the nishiki cutscenes in this game add so much needed context
[1:20:40] <Run44forrest> not realy
[1:20:41] <%Solidnick18> don't do it tho
[1:20:41] <%kiiiirsten> Now kiss
[1:20:42] <KaiserMario> The fact that Nishikiyama turns evil because of "Onee-chan" makes his motives really stupid IMO
[1:20:43] <%kiiiirsten> Oh nvm
[1:20:43] <%NWR_James> Nishiki is a fuck
[1:20:44] <deviljhojho94> hmmmmm
[1:20:47] <+HeyBoston> they kissed
[1:20:49] <%yeknomlive> he's an appropriate criminal
[1:20:50] <%frontlinecaster> @Deano8817 Yeah I cannot imagine how little sense this story made without these
[1:20:51] <dekkitout> Bitch Nishiki
[1:20:52] <deviljhojho94> kissy kissy
[1:20:52] <crystalmoonark> Nishki is a baby
[1:20:52] <+theobble> nishiki is always wrong
[1:20:54] <%ElenaManetta> Is he wearing sunglasses at night, I just noticed
[1:20:54] <%joylent_blue> nishika's a bitch
[1:20:58] <alexandrecau> I mean he didn't told him steal from the boss Pat
[1:20:58] <%SaltyDongs> true
[1:21:00] <bearwagon> I like how this scene parallels the one in 0
[1:21:01] <+Ell1ot> it's that guy you did the singing with
[1:21:02] <deviljhojho94> ur a bitch nishiki
[1:21:02] <$Plutt_bug> Did you see him give the big guy a bj
[1:21:02] <tank7013> Just like about 80% of the things Nishiki does
[1:21:03] <%connos_livereview> NISHIKI A SHIT
[1:21:03] <OhioNitsud> nishiki is a bitch
[1:21:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yooo
[1:21:03] <%kiiiirsten> Nishki never gets it right
[1:21:03] <%NWR_James> oh also Kashiwagi is a badass
[1:21:04] <+ahegotrigger> Nishiki isnt much of a Yakuza
[1:21:04] <frogurtz> I mean the Yakuza are bad people, he should never forget that.
[1:21:05] <Deano8817> BIG OOF
[1:21:05] <%snow_bush> Nishki means mistake
[1:21:06] <$Plutt_bug> TIMM-EH

[1:21:14] <$NocturneNovember> Dammit, Nishiki, you made Uncle Kashiwagi mad
[1:21:17] <Worldbrand> this characterization of nishiki into a bitch ass villain is great
[1:21:20] <%ElenaManetta> OW
[1:21:20] <%mayorrev> ouch
[1:21:21] <Run44forrest> why didnt nishki just ask this guy for a loan

[1:41:12] <%connos_livereview> kiryu would BEAST RACCOON CITY
[1:41:12] <+HellCopter> Does that make Majima Mr. X?
[1:41:15] <gunzerkingdunce> @quack_of_dawn the low price of "Do it or I stab you."
[1:41:18] <%violetheart> @gunzerkingdunce I meant a *good* one.

[1:41:21] <deviljhojho94> this cant be real
[1:41:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Majima: Hey, guys. Let's all pretend to be zombies and attack Kiryu. It'll be HILARIOUS.
[1:41:22] <%ElenaManetta> If a zombie goes into a fighting stance and starts doing combos, are they really that brainless
[1:41:24] <Reanimator83> We need a Mr. X mod
[1:41:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> "What the-?"
[1:41:27] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Oh yeah he's a criminal
[1:41:30] <Forester_Skippy> i cant belive getting stabbed made majima a zombie
[1:41:33] <%DatGuyJimbo> these people standing there cheering on kiryu beasting on zombies
[1:41:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiryu could go toe to toe with Mr X
[1:41:39] <majindusto> RESIDENT EVIL: MAJIMA
[1:41:39] <kingdudeby> Oh no, MR. Shakedown has become Mr. X

[1:41:44] <Valdorick> No, Majima is pre-5 Wesker.
[1:41:46] <SweetestEggplant> @Reanimator83 majima x
[1:41:46] <devanmuse> What makes this whole thing even better is the implication that Kiryu believes all this is real. He's buying this bullshit. Kiryu... is not a very smart man.
[1:41:48] <EnderGamma> @elenamanetta they just dp on wake up and oki

[1:42:00] <EnderGamma> so pretty brainless
[1:42:03] <%Typhaeon> Isn't Mr. X just a Mr. Shakedown?
[1:42:03] <Prevot> Mr Shakedown is basically Mr X
[1:42:03] <deviljhojho94> he is a heat user
[1:42:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> @lewdskeletor13 To Nemesis: "I heard you know a thing or two about being everywhere?"
[1:42:08] <tank7013> Kiryu could probably kill Mr. X
[1:42:08] <%AirlineFood74> dead cells

[1:43:30] <%connos_livereview> KIWAMI MEANs THAT GUYS a MANIAC
[1:43:38] <InugamiTheHound> kiryu, akiyma, majima along with Goda are in yakuza dead souls
[1:43:42] <+Someitalian123> Hey Pat I've never played or really seen Yakuza Dead Souls, why does it suck?

[1:44:12] <devanmuse> I'm still lowkey hoping to see him stream Dead Souls in October, if only for one night. I want to see what's so bad about it
[1:44:19] <+HotBloodedHero> Yakuza couldn't get shooting to work right.
[1:44:21] <+Th3SmartAlec> Falling from the skies
[1:44:21] <InugamiTheHound> get more salt
[1:44:23] <tmix1600> Legit question, can we get a dead souls stream for Halloween?
[1:44:25] <%bread_assassin> Saejima can stop a speeding car dead in its tracks, swing like a 30ft metal pipe, and rip street signs out of the ground and use them as weapons. And Kiryu's roughly as strong as hi.
[1:44:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> ACTUALLY DEAD
[1:44:28] <+theobble> PogChamp holy shit
[1:44:28] <dekkitout> PogChamp
[1:44:30] <%Solidnick18> the only good thing about dead souls is get to the top

[1:44:42] <+TastySammiches> dead souls is bad, just watch the cutscenes
[1:44:43] <+shiplord13> Yes guys the zombies are already dead
[1:44:44] <%yeknomlive> at least dead souls has majima has karaoke in it
[1:44:44] <Deano8817> do it so I don't have too you fuck
[1:44:45] <%mercado94> what if we throw money at you?
[1:44:46] <gunzerkingdunce> @devanmuse they took a 10 min shooter section and made it an entire game
[1:44:49] <majindusto> I BEAT IT :)
[1:44:52] <Valdorick> Wait, can he kill all these guys, since they're already dead?
[1:44:53] <OhioNitsud> real gamers don't skip dead souls

[1:44:58] <Run44forrest> deadsouls remaster confirmed
[1:44:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> HE'S BACK
[1:45:04] <DatAsuna> The sad part is it came out REAL CLOSE to binary domain
[1:45:05] <+MechaBaphomet> Fake Fan?
[1:45:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Dead Souls is the DMC2 of Yakuza
[1:45:08] <$imextremelymanly> you gonna dmc2 it you coward
[1:45:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh there's the golden lambo from 0
[1:45:09] <Forester_Skippy> fake fan and all that jazz
[1:45:10] <Tomschiii> "excellent" is a little far fetched tbh
[1:45:10] <DatAsuna> And binary Domain has great shooting
[1:45:11] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Hey, did you see the new Youtube drama? Videos are getting demonetised due to the things people are saying in the video's comments section.
[1:45:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ssamjangg)
[1:45:12] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Thanks for warning me, Pat
[1:45:13] <%Aitch971> ZOMBIE EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[1:45:14] <InugamiTheHound> SSohPKC did a LP of that game back in the day
[1:45:15] <+TastySammiches> dammit majima we JUST re-killed you
[1:45:17] <Buttku> good, I thought he said dead cells was awful
[1:45:18] <+TheoTTree> I hope that guy has Kiryu insurance on that bike
[1:45:18] <%Ilpala271> PICK UP THE CAR
[1:45:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> Only Birkin or a rocket launcher can stop him now!
[1:45:23] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat who at sega made the call to make dead souls anyway??
[1:45:25] <majindusto> Its not great...BUT MAJIMA IS THE BEST IN IT
[1:45:28] <zafooru> Pick up the building
[1:45:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound that's a name I haven't heard in a very long time
[1:45:31] <dekkitout> Screw that, pick up the building
[1:45:32] <Zombrocom> I left for 10 minutes why is majima a zombie
[1:45:34] <%yeknomlive> does youtube hate everyone or something?
[1:45:38] <%violetheart> Yes.
[1:45:39] <alexandrecau> the same who made binary domain
[1:45:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Zombrocom Why not?
[1:45:42] <+TheoTTree> yes
[1:45:44] <$DK_Rance> @yeknomlive yes
[1:45:47] <%Mitalis> jesus christ how many times do you have to kick Majima's ass?
[1:45:47] <%Taisuru> Streamings changed you pat, back in the day you'd play all kinds of garbage for content
[1:45:49] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat After binary Domain had great shooting, even in motorwaycar sequences, how bad is it that yakuza still does the lame press x to shoot sequences in 0 .etc?
[1:45:50] <tmix1600> So this is what dead souls should have been?
[1:45:52] <Erimos> If this game had tank controls it would be the best Resident Evil.
[1:45:58] <+eagleclassgamer> @DraxTD a very fired person who probably thought RE4-5 were great, and wanted CoD money
[1:45:58] <SweetestEggplant> yakuza may cry when?
[1:45:59] <alexandrecau> except binary domain had better shooting
[1:46:01] <%Solidnick18> face twist the zombie
[1:46:02] <Run44forrest> kiryu would beat the shit out of mr x
[1:46:02] <dekkitout> 'Hate' doesn't do it justice
[1:46:03] <frankcastle308> DEMPSY
[1:46:07] <%Niney_Who> You don't do a lot of damage Period
[1:46:08] <$SGrim> @yeknomlive no they just love money. They couldn't care less whether their content creators live or die.
[1:46:09] <InugamiTheHound> @ThatGuyfromMars yeah same here I haven't watched him in forever. I left the creatures a long time ago and he was my favorite
[1:46:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Holy hell, someone here used to watch SSoHPKC? I'll be damned if I didn't think I'd hear that name again
[1:46:18] <eprorkeqardhje> @angriestpat howcome you don't use Dragon style?
[1:46:22] <%FrostMass22> @yeknomlive YouTube actively fucks with independent creators. Unless your last name is Paul or Kimmel, they do not give a FUCK
[1:46:22] <%frontlinecaster> Didn't Binary Domain come later?
[1:46:24] <DraxTD> @eagleclassgamer ah
[1:46:27] <+MisterRockett> Cause they tried to make it work with the Yakuza ENGINE
[1:46:30] <%Solidnick18> @Reizie_Etherealm i love seamus hope he is good
[1:46:30] <Josef_Stryker> Did Dead Souls come before or after Binary Domain?
[1:46:33] <welcometolossantos> Binary Domain was a year after Dead Souls @AngriestPat
[1:46:34] <%connos_livereview> time probably
[1:46:39] <tank7013> I miss Seamus
[1:46:39] <gunzerkingdunce> @sweetesteggplant Brawl-Beast-Braw-Beas-Rush-Beast-Brawl
[1:46:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> @eprorkeqardhje It's locker off that's why. And it's only good when YOU'VE FINISHED THE ENTIRE GAME
[1:46:46] <InugamiTheHound> dead souls came out before binary domain
[1:46:48] <Run44forrest> didnt that SSoHPKC guy die
[1:46:54] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah the one thing that sucks about Dragon Style in Kiwami is that it's nerfed to shit for like 80% of the game
[1:46:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound I left that fandom when Nova went and made cowchop. i used to like SSoH's kaizo mario games, he was good at it
[1:46:55] <DatAsuna> THeir development still overlapped tho
[1:46:58] <%hawk_rush> yo, reggie from nintendo retired???
[1:46:59] <%Niney_Who> But what if that made BD bad?
[1:47:00] <frankcastle308> What!?!
[1:47:01] <DatAsuna> Binary Domain wasn't a 1 year game
[1:47:02] <$imextremelymanly> ya dragon style aint worth it until you almost maxed it out
[1:47:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Solidnick18 Last I heard he's living the Eorzean dream in FFXIV, I think he's having a good time away from YouTube
[1:47:04] <deviljhojho94> right in the kisser
[1:47:07] <Josef_Stryker> Nah Seamus just fucked off the face of the Youtube World

[1:47:20] <+Tankjutsu> Its like a super late game stance
[1:47:20] <CastellanVon> THey space out the upgrades for Dragon Style terribly
[1:47:21] <DatAsuna> Dead souls was the "nagoshi is busy" yakuza game
[1:47:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Bowser is in charge of Nintendo now

[2:03:33] <+shiplord13> Japan has become so peaceful since all the Mr. Shakedowns shakedowned themselves into extinction.

[2:41:11] <%ThePuddingDead> @ThatGuyfromMars Eh...honestly I enjoy watching the yakuza games from these guys...but it doesnt appeal to me in a gameplay aspect, I'm weird about that
[2:41:29] <KeiPrime> yeah majima everywar makes leveling up a fucking cinch
[2:41:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> Majima helps you to the Climax.

[2:43:09] <+HellCopter> majima exists solely for kiyru-chan
[2:43:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Look at his power level
[2:43:11] <%Niney_Who> How many DRUGs does Majima take to get back up so fast
[2:43:16] <KaiserMario> 2000 yen dollar bill man, RIGHT THERE
[2:43:19] <%CerberusDriver> You can definitely avoid Majima if it bothers you, hes easy to dodge
[2:43:20] <alexandrecau> yuya: go check my girl's tits kiryu
[2:43:25] <%kiiiirsten> When I left for the store 45 minutes ago Pat was fighting Majima...

[2:43:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> @HellCopter You can respect a man like that
[2:43:35] <majindusto> THE RED COMET
[2:43:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead yakuza isn't badly written, it's goofy as hell tho
[2:43:42] <%CerberusDriver> @kiiiirsten hes purposefully getting into Majima fights
[2:43:45] <%joylent_blue> kiiiirsten thats just how it be on this bitch of a Majima earth
[2:43:47] <%ooblagis> Breaker is such a pain in the ass pre-Tiger Drop
[2:43:50] <+Galactor123> @kiiiirsten Majima is EVERYWHERE
[2:43:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten welcome back, pat got beaten up a lot
[2:43:51] <%ThePuddingDead> @ThatGuyfromMars I meant god hand, THAT is badly written
[2:43:52] <InugamiTheHound> @kiiiirsten this is 3rd time he's fought majima
[2:44:01] <%kiiiirsten> Thanks, fellas!
[2:44:04] <KeiPrime> in like 10 minutes
[2:44:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead for sure, mikami could do better
[2:44:08] <%maskedriderhero> It's not like Mr. Shakedown. Fighting Majima is fun
[2:44:11] <%CerberusDriver> >god hand is badly written
[2:44:12] <%Ferakin> You can totally miss out on getting your full basic combo for Dragon style if you do the first Majima encounters a certain way
[2:44:14] <Smaenus> Kiwami means Tiger Drop
[2:44:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> @kiiiirsten When you go to bed tonight Pat will be fighting Majima, when you get up in the morning Pat will be fighting Majima...
[2:44:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think Yakuza is one of the few series where we just look at the plot holes and go "don't worry about it!"
[2:44:24] <Erimos> I wonder if after getting his ass beat Majima just eats some sushi and gets back in there.
[2:44:26] <%Ferakin> And not have the last hit in the combo for like the entire rest of the game
[2:44:28] <%kiiiirsten> @Th3SmartAlec That's the life I wanna live
[2:44:29] <majindusto> ORAORAORAORA
[2:44:33] <devanmuse> @inugamithehound are you counting zombie majima in that tally?
[2:44:35] <%joylent_blue> excuse you God Hand is fine art
[2:44:46] <px120> @Ferakin Wait, are you serious?
[2:44:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> @kiiiirsten We all need a "KIRYU-CHAAAAN" in our day to day live
[2:44:55] <%CerberusDriver> do you mean God Hands story is meh or do you think the game sucks
[2:44:59] <InugamiTheHound> @devanmuse no but if you do you got 3 times and the boss fight makes it 5 times
[2:45:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> art is subjective @joylent_blue
[2:45:02] <%Gorgen> they should make a Yakuza fighting game with only Kiryu and Majima
[2:45:03] <%Cthulos> @devanmuse They were fake teeth
[2:45:08] <InugamiTheHound> *4 not 3
[2:45:13] <%joylent_blue> ThatGuyfromMars not GOD HAND
[2:45:18] <%ThePuddingDead> @ThatGuyfromMars but that's why I love it tho, because it KNOWS its badly written, it owns it and makes up for it with the customization aspect of the fighting moves
[2:45:19] <%Ferakin> Yeah, it happened to me
[2:45:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Gorgen It's one Kiryu and 15 Majima variations
[2:45:21] <dungpie64> This version of Majima, The rush style one is so annoying to fight later on
[2:45:21] <majindusto> He's styling
[2:45:21] <CastellanVon> The main thing that makes Dragon Style suck is you don't the attack speed upgrades until very late so you can't even combo regular enemies with it.
[2:45:22] <sileo_patronus> He's having FUN, Pat!
[2:45:22] <Smaenus> Zombie Majima is such a stupid encounter, I love it
[2:45:22] <%Rngiddion> id dance if i was majima
[2:45:28] <%TallYoda08> apatBig apatBig apatBig apatFist
[2:45:29] <lucidcalyx> God hand is flawless
[2:45:34] <%ThePuddingDead> ^
[2:45:37] <%ThePuddingDead> heh
[2:45:37] <%joylent_blue> ^
[2:45:40] <+Th3SmartAlec> Nice dodge
[2:45:42] <%CerberusDriver> You can suplex a dude in a gorilla suit in God Hand
[2:45:42] <%Ferakin> I didn't have the full combo for like almost the whole game and it ruined Dragon style for me so hard
[2:45:44] <+Toast_Master_General> Majima has literally lost buckets of blood from these fights. he should just be a fluid-less husk by now
[2:45:45] <KeiPrime> everyone's idol majima tho
[2:45:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Toast_Master_General He can take it for Kiryu chan
[2:45:58] <$Plutt_bug> Majima is my dad
[2:46:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Toast_Master_General he drinks a lot of water
[2:46:03] <%mr_slaide> Hey Pat, you fucking nerd.
[2:46:06] <%joylent_blue> reminder that Majima was stabbed in the stomach NOT A DAY AGO
[2:46:06] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Bold of you to assume that Majima needs blood
[2:46:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> @KeiPrime Sunao ni I Love You
[2:46:13] <%ooblagis> I'd like it more if they weren't such jerks and still made it reduced damage on repeat uses like other Heat Moves, because YOU HAVE TO USE IT MULTIPLE TIMES
[2:46:15] <sileo_patronus> I thought Heat actions only scaled on the repeat uses of the same one
[2:46:15] <%maskedriderhero> Dragon Style is really only useful for it's variety of heat moves and abilities, but every other Style, especially early on, outclasses it
[2:46:17] <KaiserMario> Majima is love!
[2:46:21] <CastellanVon> tbh, the only thing Dragon is good for is Tiger Drop but Tiger Drop breaks the fucking game in half.
[2:46:22] <$Plutt_bug> big climax
[2:46:23] <%estes1> man, I want to a xray of these two assholes. they must have dents and fist imprints and shit.
[2:46:24] <DraxTD> getting close to B
[2:46:26] <+MechaBaphomet> You need to give majima the big climax
[2:46:28] <%mr_slaide> Yes, you're weird.
[2:46:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> but will kiryu learn the umbran climax
[2:46:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Are the heat moves in Judge Eyes randomized?
[2:46:31] <%ThePuddingDead> yes
[2:46:32] <px120> @Fealom Wow. The hell did they miss that?

[2:50:54] <KeiPrime> like this one and the widow quest
[2:50:54] <+cahv123> Everyone gets really antsy about someone who kills a leader. It's almost Kotor levels of "You can't just kill the lead the guy" "why not?" "Because you just don't do that."
[2:50:56] <KaptainKappathe5th> majima a woman has been kidnapped can this wait
[2:50:56] <+MechaBaphomet> Kiriyu-chan
[2:50:58] <$Quack_of_Dawn> I don't have time for this Majima, boobs are gonna get killed
[2:50:58] <deviljhojho94> i cant believe that guy is fucking dead
[2:51:00] <+Brickhaus_> Not now Majima! A man just died, have some respect!
[2:51:03] <%mr_slaide> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[2:51:07] <%joylent_blue> this is not a main quest, which is why its weird its voice acted and has cutscenes and shit
[2:51:08] <%Keyd00d> it's by the park
[2:51:14] <phone5> where is this game in the yakuza timeline?
[2:51:24] <bleugh> majima every 5 seconds system
[2:51:24] <Deano8817> these side quests had cutscenes and VO in the original too I think
[2:51:25] <%Keyd00d> UWOH
[2:51:25] <%EdgyMacaroon> wink wink
[2:51:25] <gunzerkingdunce> @phone5 first
[2:51:25] <%topendbuzz> hint it's near the park
[2:51:26] <WaxWitch> clap for that man
[2:51:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> @phone5 After 0 and before 2
[2:51:28] <%AirlineFood74> @phone5 yakuza 1
[2:51:31] <InugamiTheHound> first yakuza game
[2:51:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> No majimas!
[2:51:36] <%maskedriderhero> @joylent_blue Theres another sidequest that doesn't get cutscenes, but is fully voiced. It's so weird
[2:51:36] <%Gogogolem> He hangs out with Kiryr you gotta be tough
[2:51:38] <phone5> thaank u
[2:51:40] <Deano8817> since they play into the main story somewhat
[2:51:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> North
[2:51:44] <Prevot> they kinda did in 6
[2:51:45] <+HellCopter> In Yakuza 6 they're all voiced
[2:51:45] <alexandrecau> @joylent_blue nah some kiwami sidequest got lot of love like that and be my bab7 in 2
[2:51:46] <%ooblagis> That's a LOT of money
[2:51:48] <sileo_patronus> @phone5 second, after 0 which is the prequel/start of the remakes
[2:51:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @phone5 it's set in 2004 or 05, it's the first in the series but not the first chronologically.
[2:51:52] <Sunditsu> There's another one like this I think
[2:51:52] <KeiPrime> 2 has the diaper dress up one
[2:51:52] <%laserbeaming> Yuya deserves it?
[2:51:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> Welp
[2:51:56] <krymzen5> 6 kinda is
[2:52:01] <Sunditsu> but only that one
[2:52:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu chaaaan~~
[2:52:08] <%Ilpala271> what a mysterious majima
[2:52:09] <+applefibs> monkaS
[2:52:10] <tank7013> Was that a drunk guy or zombie Maj over there?
[2:52:11] <+Brickhaus_> Watch out, that manhole lid looks awful suspicious
[2:52:12] <42nfl19> spooky
[2:52:13] <KaptainKappathe5th> hes in the bike
[2:52:14] <%Gogogolem> He's over there pat
[2:52:17] <bearwagon> hes probably in vincent
[2:52:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's weird that the PS3 has the most Yakuza games, like the majority of them are on it
[2:52:26] <+Raidou24> Well in this certain substories have some kind of tie into the main story
[2:52:28] <colzack_> it's because this substory and a few others were voiced in the original so they made them voiced in this one too
[2:52:29] <%maskedriderhero> Hes not in the game Pat, he's in your house
[2:52:32] <%maskedriderhero> ELMO IS MAJIMA
[2:52:34] <xtremegamer80> Has he done the "club" substory yet?
[2:52:38] <%blackace186> aw majima's gone now
[2:52:38] <+applefibs> it'd be great if he was dressed up as a street punk and rips off a mask
[2:52:43] <Smaenus> Tachibana PogChamp

[2:52:57] <Run44forrest> elmo is nishki
[2:52:57] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat When Majima is not on the map, you can trigger him by going inside restaurants, clubs, and bars

[3:22:17] <GandhiTheTerrible> SourPls
[3:22:17] <%poweredscoot> Kiryu just used their body weight against them. Gravity is what killed them.
[3:22:19] <SilverFaustX> technically the floor killed them
[3:22:20] <$shurtal> Kiwami means Mamoru, and Mamoru means nobody get's left behind
[3:22:22] <majindusto> They're in a Coma...It's Ok
[3:22:23] <%yeknomlive> kiryu's dancin all night

[3:22:36] <+ilasper1> freeze time and drink some energy drinks
[3:22:37] <Run44forrest> kiryu is about to not kill a lot of people in a bit
[3:22:41] <GandhiTheTerrible> drank
[3:22:41] <$cureneckbeard> The moral of this game is that you can solve pretty much everything with fistfights
[3:22:43] <CrypticMochi> Kiryu has Akuma fists
[3:22:43] <%supersugoisenpai1> These guys are smart, there's no furniture for Kiryu to swing
[3:22:50] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Debolah is japanese for really really soft floors
[3:22:52] <%yeknomlive> this song sounds like p3 music
[3:22:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> Nevermind, there's a table
[3:22:57] <Joestar1890> I just realized Yakuza is the perfect series for pat because energy drinks give you power
[3:23:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This probably won't have any family related consequences
[3:23:04] <Run44forrest> they nailed the furniture to the ground so kiryu couldnt use it
[3:23:05] <%joylent_blue> that heat move makes little sense but its great
[3:23:07] <ScreamingMeat> Kiryu just over flowing with BEASTLY sexual energy
[3:23:10] <$Plutt_bug> Elmis needs pets
[3:23:11] <%SaltyDongs> Not as much energy gained from redbull though
[3:23:15] <KaptainKappathe5th> the only way to counter kiryu is to bolt all the furniture to the floor

[3:23:45] <CastellanVon> You can cheese fights in Kiwami 2 by just throwing everybody into the river. It's great.
[3:23:49] <%ooblagis> Man, I hate this whole subplot so much. It goes fucking nowhere, contributes nothing, and has the worst, most unfun melodrama that Yakuza writing has to offer

[3:53:16] <%king_wragles> 11? That's ODD!!!
[3:53:16] <3InchMensch> it's even more confusing given that Asian women don't age until they're like 70

[3:56:11] <DSD24> That guy has a gun!
[3:56:12] <$Tuskor13> That's because it's the hardest punch Date ever threw but Date isn't god-king Kiryu
[3:56:12] <WaxWitch> He's still young, he can have another kid, this one is a dumb ass FailFish
[3:56:15] <+HellCopter> There's a Climax Battle where you play as Date, he's staggering drunk and has a single slow two-punch combo, it's hilariously pathetic
[3:56:16] <st_jimmy456> ehh okay, my bad
[3:56:17] <+MisterRockett> I DID expect him to fall down, yeah.

[3:56:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man Kiryu's suit takes a cut like a champ, doesn't even tear
[3:56:50] <%SmoochSpider> Most areas in Japan have chosen to make the age of consent 18

[3:57:08] <Joestar1890> Never killed ANYONE
[3:57:08] <thebehatted> you don't come back from that!
[3:57:11] <%ooblagis> Date is actually way stronger in this fight than when you play as him BibleThump
[3:57:14] <+shiplord13> How many not murders has Kiryu committed so far
[3:57:14] <SilverFaustX> kiryu is 27 in 1
