[0:17:41] <inkandamber> Some furry ass nightmare right there.
[0:17:48] <+Rekinsinn> @disflipmat exactly. technically, there's dedicated zones that behave like their own contained level, but without borders separating it from the rest of the world
[0:17:52] <%AfternoonConcession> nintendo polish is something else
[0:18:52] <+pre10cious_1> hello Patrick ✌
[0:18:56] <%bassoontyphoon> only 68 left before the stream is over
[0:19:08] <%THATGUY_789> he did it, he did it for the rock
[0:19:08] <%chiazam> that's why
[0:19:15] <%AfternoonConcession> nice
[0:19:30] <+Stormzcales_Lair> #notmyWendy
[0:19:33] <disflipmat> @Rekinsinn Was Odyssey like this? I never got around to playing it but the idea of this feels like Mario 64 on steroids and I kinda like it
[0:19:35] <%0rond> do you plan to get all the shines? you probably don't need all 100 of them to beat bowser @PatStaresAt
[0:19:37] <dan_g_v> bakana
[0:19:39] <agrocraig01> wow
[0:19:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god I just saw how many items Pat has, why.

[0:20:18] <%AfternoonConcession> how's zangief and elmo?
[0:20:22] <rameiramaster> This is way more substancial than I tought it would be
[0:20:26] <%hypermike88> hypermike88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! is this the bowser’s fury part of 3d world?
[0:20:33] <%Movemeister> as a joke
[0:20:43] <%Monkeyweed21> no you wont
[0:20:43] <Shwepie> @disflipmat Mario Odyssey was like this, yes. Some would even say they put the Mario Odyssey DLC in the wrong game.
[0:20:45] <%THATGUY_789> a mistake
[0:20:55] <%maenos2> can't really hear paige explain pat washing dishes btw
[0:20:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> you are the concienciest man

[0:21:11] <%chiazam> Goddamn
[0:21:13] <%cowardman93> I've never had a meatloaf and at this point I'm too scared to ask what it is
[0:21:13] <+silentblast93> pat wht aer you lying
[0:21:14] <bigshedman> haha, pat loves his mom
[0:21:14] <+Rekinsinn> @hypermike88 Yeah, regular 3D world looks completely different from this, you'd see a timer in the corner for instance
[0:21:15] <+pre10cious_1> thank u pat, love u too
[0:21:19] <@SoFarFetched> Paiges fingers get a reaction from washing too much and her back is still fucked.
[0:21:21] <%THATGUY_789> ha
[0:21:22] <%AfternoonConcession> as long as you're not dying then the food is ok pat
[0:21:24] <+Stormzcales_Lair> meatloaf can be good or bad
[0:21:25] <agrocraig01> wow how convenient, so many chore related injuries/aliments
[0:21:27] <%SirGO0SE> @PeachSaliva people have probably said it, but big rubber kitchen gloves are where its at for doing dishes when you have sensitive skin/get grossed out
[0:21:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cowardman93 It is like hamburger, but as a square.
[0:21:35] <%Jrocy247> Man, Meatloaf is so boring to me
[0:21:45] <%Ranryu692> @cowardman93 it's basically ground beef, egg, and spices cooked in a loaf shape
[0:21:45] <TheBeanBox> Oh wow if Paige made you meatloaf and you forgot and said you never had a good one, you'd be in trouble
[0:21:48] <@SoFarFetched> Hey Meatloaf has had a few good songs geefSmugAF
[0:21:51] <%chiazam> Wait is Paige just Megumi Yakushiji with a dash of Ryoko Shinonome?
[0:22:01] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:22:02] <%THATGUY_789> next pet i get either a dog or cat imma gonna name him meatloaf
[0:22:08] <%cowardman93> @SoFarFetched LUL
[0:22:09] <%AfternoonConcession> what are some good canadian food places to eat at?
[0:22:17] <rekinom> I dont like how mario lifts his tail suggestively
[0:22:21] <$StrawberryPantsu> Meatloaf is good
[0:22:21] <@SoFarFetched> Pat would do anything for love,but he won't do that.
[0:22:22] <%Ranryu692> good meatloaf is good
[0:22:23] <%wibbwobbler> peaches+ meatloaf
[0:22:25] <%bassoontyphoon> @AfternoonConcession NOT Tim Horton's
[0:22:27] <Nootyman> ohhhh, I just figured the pun here with the seagulls
[0:22:28] <%Huntercd> Nah Paige isn't as crazy as those two
[0:22:34] <%Ranryu692> no pegging for Pat
[0:22:35] <agrocraig01> meat loaf is perfect winter foooood
[0:22:37] <%Alazull> Tell her she is big strong enough and believe in her culinary talents
[0:22:43] <%Jrocy247> So like, Is big Bowser just on a timer?
[0:22:45] <%AfternoonConcession> gotcha, definitely tim hortons
[0:22:46] <bigshedman> Meatloaf needs spices and a good glazing/dressing
[0:22:54] <Nootyman> Japanese call the seagulls "Umineko" which means "sea cats"
[0:22:56] <+pre10cious_1> how Dry is it!?!?!
[0:22:59] <%Monkeyweed21> whiter than Woolie's rhythm game skills
