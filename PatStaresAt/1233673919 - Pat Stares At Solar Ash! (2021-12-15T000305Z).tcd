[0:27:42] <ExpressNode> So did anyone see those new PS5 faceplates. They look pretty nice!
[0:27:45] <President_Pariah> Nintendo Indies Showcase is just a showcase of games you could be wishlisting on Steam instead but thanks for the trailers
[0:27:50] <Louie_Salmon> Silksong is cancelled, they added so many features it is now an MMO and will be out in 5 years
[0:27:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, listen to me, there is no Silksong, you gotta let go of her, we're worried about you, man.
[0:27:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> this man and his charmed life.
[0:28:08] <%CatzkyGuy> Were never getting Silksong, just give up hope and they will release a trailer announcing a date, thats how it works.

[0:29:25] <Treasure_Vault> Pat does all of his casual gaming naked
[0:29:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Solar Ash? You mean Solar Skies? The best song from the StarLord album?? I love the Guardians game.
[0:29:39] <%shurtal> well, with the shirt over the camera
[0:29:40] <%JamesCorck> JamesCorck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hey Pat, from last week's podcast, which is your favorite conspiracy? Mine is the one about the birds being drones, and the Covid being "invented" so that everyone stayed home and they could replace the batteries in the birds.
[0:29:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big brain
[0:29:43] <%JoshManVGH> And the camera thing, hat on work off
[0:29:48] <@tizz86> the difference is the presence of pants
[0:29:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dude, I work from my bedroom, you have to find some way to divide things mentally
[0:29:48] <%holydeviant1> It's the mic, it's all the mic
[0:29:48] <bob900000> the difference!!!
[0:29:48] <@Ranryu692> not wearing pants probably helps to remind you that you aren't working
[0:29:51] <%FunkyStreams> does the mic stay on during sex?
[0:29:52] <%IamGrapes> oooo we're seeing Pat's home
[0:29:54] <ExpressNode> Ever think about how your mic will go hot again
[0:29:56] <%baka_sugoi> Casual gaming in underware

[0:30:16] <+ArCielArDor> Do you find the energy to play games offstream or does it just feel like work now?
[0:30:23] <WFN_Art> I can't believe Solar Ash has been out for this long, I had absolutely no idea
[0:30:23] <+McSoliace> the camera would be incredibly horrifying if i did that even with the hat
[0:30:26] <%athuramn> until he moved it, I never noticed there was a mic arm in front of him oO
[0:30:27] <%IamGrapes> that's a real talent, Pat
[0:30:28] <%TheGreatSunbro> Pat channeling Bob Barker somehow

[0:30:41] <%shurtal> there's an "effort" slider in pat's head, and it's easily adjustable
[0:30:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> I know people who "walk to work" as a way to separate things and just walk around the block before starting their day
[0:30:44] <%dekkitout> Hey now, EGS finallt has a cart tho
[0:30:44] <%YakumoYomi> I clapped when he said "Fuck the EGS"
[0:30:44] <gslayer14> ngl low energy pat is powerful

[0:32:51] <gslayer14> that's what you need
[0:32:51] <Louie_Salmon> I liked the later parts.
[0:32:57] <+LastHazzerd> which twist
[0:32:58] <%RealThiele> bad twist
[0:33:01] <ArcOfDeath> i still liked it
[0:33:03] <+MisterAvry> that sin
[0:33:03] <%andrewofbob> So, play until the twist?
[0:33:04] <%kyh9> Which game?
[0:33:05] <%afronooch> i cheesed it after the twist and didnt regret it
[0:33:07] <ExpressNode> Speaking of rogue likes I got Returnal. Gonna have to play it later
[0:33:10] <%YakumoYomi> I disagree. I like the Act 2 game more than the first act.
[0:33:10] <%dasmause> hey pat, im here to check out solar ash to make sure its good before i inevitably buy it because HLD is rad, and then im off to walk the end
[0:33:10] <%doomunderthestairs> talking about deathloop?
[0:33:10] <%dekkitout> I enjoyed the twist, no clue what moxes are, but still
[0:33:10] <gslayer14> god i wish there was an overhaul for part 3
[0:33:11] <+LastHazzerd> i liked Act 2 the most
[0:33:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the problem Deathloop had
[0:33:17] <%kyh9> Wait, which game?
[0:33:18] <Zombrocom> It's also just nice to see ol leshy again

[0:33:22] <%RealThiele> the mod coming out to make it part 1 roguelike is promising
[0:33:22] <KaiserMario> What do you mean?
[0:33:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> Nah, disagree, I LOVED both chapters after the cabin. The one thing I missed was the roguelike element

[0:33:26] <Profmcstevie> Feels like their was clarity of vision on that "first part"
[0:33:28] <%BinaryFireball> do you wish you never played the later parts?
[0:33:31] <Louie_Salmon> Nah the second one was rad, it was like that Capcom card game
[0:33:34] <+LastHazzerd> Act 3 is a drag to start, but gets nutty by the end
[0:33:37] <@tizz86> psaDab
[0:33:42] <heartlesshealer> I liked the part after the first twist, but it wasn't the same, yeah

[0:36:10] <%RealThiele> MCH shotgun is satisfying to use
[0:36:15] <tlflordhand> ponder that ugandan orb so you know dae wae
[0:36:21] <waltzqueen> @heartlesshealer lack of pressure is easier to deal with that too much of it i guess

[0:43:38] <%andrewofbob> Not enjoyably
[0:43:39] <+Kittilot> i have had my account since i was 15...

[0:43:47] <%RyTYoung> GOTTEM

[0:43:48] <%DianaTheAscian> are u gonna?
[0:43:49] <bob900000> even the old ones?
[0:43:49] <BigFingerRo> maybe force paige to do omikron?
[0:43:50] <Zeif00> how about a collection of garbage?
[0:43:51] <%hairtoday> it's like drinking alone
[0:43:51] <AngryAsian5> Got to spread out the soul damage LUL
[0:43:54] <%Buttlo> I don't know if David Cage games are enjoyable alone, I think you need someone else to shit talk them with.
[0:43:55] <%andrewofbob> SOLD
[0:43:57] <rustybuckethead21> well, now you can wait for Eclipse to play.
[0:43:58] <penitentpendant> Sounds normal
[0:43:59] <%RyTYoung> damn don't gottem
[0:43:59] <%Piemen99> Piemen99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Howdy pat pit pitty pat snack.....with the orb...? Eh who knows what im trying to do anymore 41 months psaDab psaDab
[0:43:59] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Hey Pat you're great Pat because you're Pat and Pat is great. Wrote that first part when drunk yesterday and forgot to send. I stand by it though so here
[0:44:03] <KaiserMario> Why not?
[0:44:03] <AXL808> Paige doesn't stream!
[0:44:03] <%Breaknoon> what garbage does she play?
[0:44:03] <%FacetiousAF> Fuck a David cage game
[0:44:08] <%JoshManVGH> How about a stream where you and paige wire her network up. Like no special camera set up, just the two of you yelling off screen
[0:44:08] <Treasure_Vault> That's good.
[0:44:08] <%IamGrapes> Fair Deal
[0:44:09] <ape_hawk> but paige always plays you
[0:44:12] <heartlesshealer> She'll drag you into another Baba stream
[0:44:21] <+polothegreatest> pat at risk LUL
[0:44:21] <DynDimAcsiwn> when I have game pass I play shit games just to cleanse the pallette
[0:44:24] <Nootyman> Don't fuck a David Cage game, you'll find yourself in a shower scene
[0:44:29] <%IamGrapes> @FacetiousAF like, the disk?
[0:44:43] <KaiserMario> To be fair, Pat does play garbage consistently, he has been playing Halo and FF14
[0:44:49] <KaiserMario> LUL
[0:45:08] <%RealThiele> RIP AND TEAR
[0:45:09] <%baka_sugoi> RIP
[0:45:10] <%RyTYoung> csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[0:45:19] <kes009900> is pat getting slimmer...?
[0:45:22] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[0:45:25] <%holydeviant1> Paladin went for it at 10 percent and DID IT
[0:45:26] <%shurtal> Bloodwhetting SO GOOD
[0:45:32] <+Kittilot> People clown on me for playing Lalafell but it's just cause its the closest thing to tarutaru, which i liked a lot because they look more like gnomes and goblins and less like literal children
[0:45:33] <Madinki> I am VERY excited to use the force in order to make the ballsacks fart, hon hon.
[0:45:33] <%RealThiele> WAR: healer who?
[0:45:34] <%CzeekyTV> PLD/WAR soloing the boss from 60% is so annoying and boring. Faster to just reset and kill with everyone there
[0:45:37] <%SatChamp> parry time
[0:45:37] <%Alazull> "Played well" being a very STRONG component
[0:45:45] <%Visorak6> I saw a PLD nearly solo a dungeon boss himself
[0:45:54] <KCfusecoast> Strong component
[0:46:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I don't man, I'm leveling GBN and I don't think that would work. I think that only works for WAR and PAL
[0:46:12] <%Faustgesicht> F
[0:46:13] <%FunkyStreams> yeah, yuh dingus.
[0:46:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> also fuck you watch me be better
[0:46:16] <%CzeekyTV> Im the tank in that situation, so i just wipe but meh
[0:46:20] <%Alazull> You mad because the tank is styling on you?
[0:46:22] <KCfusecoast> Pat do you stream on two pcs and if so do you use an Intel based system?
[0:46:22] <%shurtal> Betray trust, go slower, job gets done
[0:46:22] <%KineticZen> Just don't die 4Head
[0:46:25] <%Visorak6> Also sit kid
[0:46:25] <%pandapeeps> I was gonna start ff14 as soon as Qs go down, is it sane to start as a healer since I play that elsewhere?
[0:46:29] <%IamGrapes> get dunk'd on
[0:46:31] <Louie_Salmon> Just don't die 4Head
[0:46:33] <%CalderGaming> damn, toxic
[0:46:36] <gslayer14> just play perfectly 5head
[0:46:37] <Profmcstevie> You've already told the world you'll die early, the dead have no opinions on this matter
[0:46:39] <KaiserMario> If get one of those bathroom douches, you need to wipe less
[0:46:39] <%holydeviant1> Paladin managed from 15 percent on Zenos, that was fun as hell to watch
[0:46:40] <heartlesshealer> healers adjust
[0:46:42] <%RealThiele> im also digging having a res on my SMN
[0:46:44] <%JoshManVGH> DRK does make for quicker runs it seems but you have to trust your healer.
[0:46:45] <Dopamien> do you wipe sitting down or standing up?
[0:46:47] <%Alazull> No shit?
[0:46:49] <CurrySauseBandit> Healing looks like it's going to suck once the tanks filter out this patch. Not that it doesn't already.
[0:46:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> No way
[0:46:52] <penitentpendant> She does very little tank damage
[0:46:53] <%LastHazzerd> LastHazzerd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Just finished the "Heavensward" Quest and 3.0 content. I cried a little because the rando Full Party waited for me to finish cutscene so they could emote cheer for me as i walked to the exit.
[0:46:57] <+Kyma1020> what a chaf
[0:46:58] <+MidnightBasker> People out here treating an MMO like a Single Player
[0:47:02] <@Ranryu692> my favorite gameplay moments so far have been when the healer stands in garbage and dies and I keep us alive as a PLD
[0:47:02] <%baka_sugoi> SIGMA GRIND SET
[0:47:03] <%strakillias> That's a hero right there
[0:47:05] <%CzeekyTV> And when it's just the healer dying because they're new, then they have to sit on the floor so the tank can have a big dick, it's annoying
[0:47:06] <heartlesshealer> damn
[0:47:06] <atlasdotwav> Solo
[0:47:09] <%kyh9> WAR is just built different
[0:47:12] <%holydeviant1> WAR sustain is hilarious.
[0:47:13] <%JoshManVGH> That's impressive
[0:47:15] <%Logoth_> They dont have enrage timers?
[0:47:16] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I'm kind of spiteful and feel like "You wasted my time by failing, now I'll waste yours by finishing it alone."
[0:47:16] <%bravebravesrobin> thoughts on the release of Genshin Impact condoms? Cheer500
[0:47:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> THAT GUY IS MY HERO
[0:47:17] <@CreepyPorpoise> I can't say I do, tbh
[0:47:18] <%Buttlo> I would definitely stay alive and solo it in that situation to make everyone hate me.
[0:47:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> What class was he?
[0:47:22] <%RyTYoung> wow
[0:47:22] <Ubu2933> He deserves you as his audience
[0:47:24] <%IamGrapes> embrace the Unga
[0:47:24] <atlasdotwav> Leave jiren to me
[0:47:25] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> hold the line, oh the lines gone.
[0:47:29] <@SpaceCapnCrone> yeah
[0:47:30] <%W1nterTitan> What a god
[0:47:34] <%RealThiele> Raw intuition is nuts as a 25 sec cd
[0:47:35] <KCfusecoast> Pat do you stream on two pcs and if so do you use an Intel based system?
[0:47:38] <+Kittilot> i wanna play ff14 again, but i just got an index so im not paying 13 dollars for a game i wont play most of this month
[0:47:42] <%kyh9> Reject Darkness, Embrace the Beast
[0:47:45] <%holydeviant1> Hold the line! ...Hold the dot! I am the dot!
[0:47:49] <KCfusecoast> Yo @creepyporpoise snowbi1PugLove snowbi1PugLove
[0:47:51] <%Visorak6> was that ozma or calofisteri?
[0:48:03] <%FunkyStreams> just sell your car to buy one
[0:48:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> @KCfusecoast o/
[0:48:11] <%CzeekyTV> just know the mechanics the first time you face any boss 4Head
[0:48:11] <Estwilde> you mean those cards that don't exist
[0:48:13] <%KineticZen> Gee, I guess we should just go buy a new video card
[0:48:14] <%FunkyStreams> and then finance another car, somehow.
[0:48:17] <%FunkyStreams> profit.
[0:48:18] <General_Terro> and now its almost impossible for war to die
[0:48:26] <+MidnightBasker> @FunkyStreams Few organs short of a 3080 buddy
[0:48:28] <KCfusecoast> Yeah their great
[0:48:30] <+Kyma1020> I remember soloing the last boss of cutters cry at the launch of ARR as Pal
[0:48:34] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat best gaming TV for under $1000?
[0:48:34] <%JoshManVGH> I want to not be a pain to the healer, which WAR is not, but DRK is still fun to play but feels concerning brittel, it sucks.
[0:48:40] <AoiRob> all of the rtx 30 do that?
[0:48:46] <Enthaarungscreme> rtings
[0:48:46] <+alphonseisbest> ayo Pat I CAN WATCH THIS STREAM YAY
[0:48:48] <Sotetsu> @patstaresat Did you see the new announcement for the next DBD killer?
[0:49:07] <%RealThiele> how invested in story are you
[0:49:10] <%Logoth_> Is there a worth doing list for past expansions?
[0:49:20] <%Dianaillumani> and Omega
[0:49:20] <@Ranryu692> crap now I have to play FFT first
[0:49:21] <@SpaceCapnCrone> four lords baybee
[0:49:23] <%twoto858> what about the raids?
[0:49:26] <RetributionP> you stopped playing Endwalker what are you doing there are crafter to level and tombs to get
[0:49:26] <CurrySauseBandit> @JoshManVGH If your party is good already. Play DRK, the healer will thank you for it not being a snoozefest.
[0:49:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> you dont have to do the nier stuff before you keep going, but its the only one that isn't referenced somehow later
[0:49:31] <%Visorak6> All blue quests?
[0:49:35] <+alphonseisbest> GO WATCH HIS OLD FF STREAMS
[0:49:38] <%Frost_Quill> Coils is vital but the game pretends it isn't for some reason.
[0:49:40] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:49:40] <%CzeekyTV> ARR relic grind
[0:49:43] <%DeadStage> Currently grinding Trusts to 90, half way done.
[0:49:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> NUH
[0:49:56] <+Shikari21> wrong
[0:49:59] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat but the ozma mount though
[0:50:02] <%RealThiele> coils and eScape are great
[0:50:02] <+MidnightBasker> @CreepyPorpoise Nier stuff will be referenced in the next Yoko Taro mobile game
[0:50:03] <Zeif00> Eureka isn't that bad anymore
[0:50:07] <+alphonseisbest> BIG WRONG
[0:50:09] <yukichocomilk> the cute hairstyle
[0:50:11] <Tracazoid> Gotta ride the death orb
[0:50:14] <@SpaceCapnCrone> finishing Eureka gets you stuff in the Endwalker MSQ though
[0:50:14] <%RyTYoung> What's eureka?
[0:50:15] <+Kyma1020> that is the most wrong statement I've heard
[0:50:15] <%holydeviant1> I saw Alexander gear and I was like "aw man that raid looks painful"
[0:50:16] <Enthaarungscreme> Can you completely ignore housing?
[0:50:16] <+alphonseisbest> Also Ozma is eazy to get
[0:50:17] <%shurtal> join a Eureka discord, hardest part of BA is getting into a party
[0:50:22] <%JoshManVGH> Ozma looks cool but that sounds like a pain
[0:50:24] <heartlesshealer> gotta orb of forgotten god
[0:50:29] <%Frost_Quill> Definitely do Four Lords, you need them to get the dog mounts.
[0:50:30] <%Logoth_> It would be like a human ridding a giant ape
[0:50:31] <%RealThiele> housing totally optional
[0:50:34] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[0:50:36] <Estwilde> elemental tank armor is nice, but -everyone- wears it

[0:50:40] <%Visorak6> boy I forgot how much squadrons suck to level
[0:50:42] <+alphonseisbest> it is ... kinda
[0:50:46] <heartlesshealer> Baby Grandpa <3
[0:50:49] <+Kittilot> fat kity
[0:50:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I wish I could get into 14, but I can't, I just bounce off and I can't tell you exactly why
[0:50:56] <%AnthroMetal> psaElmo
[0:51:01] <scrumbotime> I dress like a dad in that one button up jimmy buffet shirt
[0:51:02] <+alphonseisbest> YA
[0:51:04] <+alphonseisbest> ye
[0:51:08] <%holydeviant1> Queue is at 2.2k now
[0:51:09] <+alphonseisbest> fair
[0:51:16] <Estwilde> yeah it's all about the glow if you dig that
[0:51:28] <Tracazoid> Oh boy will they
[0:51:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Holy shit, someone cancelled a date for this fate spawn, christ
[0:51:30] <%holydeviant1> Heavensward is a gut STAB
[0:51:34] <acsn88> Is FFXIV worth playing just for the story if you have no interest in raiding? Raided in WoW for years and have no interest anymore.
[0:51:34] <%RealThiele> BIG stab
[0:51:38] <%Nekros4442> @plaidisthenewplaid the concept of a JRPG that gets continuous dlc every 3 months and doesnt ever stop is not for everything
[0:51:39] <%UvBenServed> :)
[0:51:56] <%RealThiele> @acsn88 you can dodge pretty much all raiding
[0:52:01] <%DeadStage> Heart of Corundum is straight up the best one btw
[0:52:12] <%Nekros4442> @acsn88 i'd say 14 is pretty much built for people like you
[0:52:16] <%thedankestmeeme> 28 yeh
[0:52:22] <+queaks> People talking about MMOs is the nerdiest shit
[0:52:28] <%furiousfurioso> new shelltron is such a massive improvement over old shelltron it rules
[0:52:28] <%Alazull> It's like a 4 second window for Holy Shield
[0:52:28] <TheSpoonyBard27> The 90 caster tome set is rydia from ff4 cosplay but im a big buff ogre._.
[0:52:29] <Nordguy> wait, bloodwhettibg gives you a SHIELD
[0:52:38] <xxshadowxx416> is shadowbringer a filler season
[0:52:40] <Ubu2933> the normal raids are easy to do for the story but the ultimate raiding is completly optional
[0:52:41] <Nordguy> thats too much
[0:52:44] <%RealThiele> yea tanks have active mitigation
[0:52:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> How do you tell what a tank buster is?
[0:52:51] <ape_hawk> playing video games for money is cringe
[0:52:51] <%DeadStage> Heart of Corundum gives you the most % and also a flat heal that can CRIT
[0:52:51] <%JoshManVGH> TBN is still 25% absorbed damage, that's pretty good!
[0:52:52] <%thedankestmeeme> Chad's talk about mmo you mean
[0:52:54] <%FunkyStreams> I've never seen avideogame played, here.
[0:52:56] <Profmcstevie> This is a nerd site loser
[0:52:56] <Sotetsu> What a nerd, he plays vidjagames.
[0:53:01] <+Kittilot> who trying to raid in toontown rewritten
[0:53:03] <%Frost_Quill> @xxshadowxx416 Not at all, it's VITALLY important to the story.
[0:53:04] <RetributionP> is ff14 the one piece
[0:53:07] <%DianaTheAscian> read
[0:53:09] <Treasure_Vault> MMOs suck because I'm wrong, not because they're bad.
[0:53:11] <Estwilde> @acsn88 100% Im for sure not the first to say it but FF14 is mostly a single player FF game with a few added multiplayer elements for some areas
[0:53:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Aww those are cute pet names
[0:53:16] <%Nekros4442> yeah healer/caster females won huge with the tomestone gear. Rydia's set looks so damn good
[0:53:16] <%holydeviant1> Doesn't it flash red and yellow?
[0:53:17] <%dekkitout> Clearly, this guy hasn't binged 3 hours of geology/ecology content for the fuck of it
[0:53:20] <%Logoth_> FF14 is as long as one piece at least
[0:53:27] <%RealThiele> new tank busters have a nice red and black circle around you
[0:53:36] <%shurtal> the tankbuster names on the castbar usually make sense for the boss you're fighting
[0:53:39] <+MidnightBasker> Its da babey
[0:53:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh nice gotcha!
[0:53:49] <%kulmoth> i wish they would apply marker improvements to old content
[0:53:51] <%Logoth_> New Age of Goblin
[0:53:53] <Dopamien> Pathologic 2? PogChamp
[0:53:56] <%baka_sugoi> MIND GOBLIN S2 psaGoblin
[0:53:57] <RetributionP> more dangerous is the yellow varient that is an Aoe tank buster
[0:53:58] <%BinaryFireball> that a mindgoblin I share
[0:53:58] <General_Terro> oh boy
[0:53:58] <%thedankestmeeme> S THAT WHAT THAT IS? kinda like the group icon but smaller and red and tightly wrapped around your char?
[0:53:58] <%JoshManVGH> That retical is been really great for popping Feint too!
[0:54:03] <%shurtal> if it's named something that that boss would use as a tankbuster, it's PROBBLY a tank buster
[0:54:06] <+ALazo> I mean. It is so easy to forget nioh 1 exists while playing 2
[0:54:07] <+MidnightBasker> Rekindle the first goblin Pat
[0:54:11] <shadowstreakXIII> Bloodwhetting is a great button
[0:54:12] <TheHeroAppears> it's hard I'm only like halfway through
[0:54:14] <%RealThiele> Nioh 2 +G
[0:54:17] <%thedankestmeeme> I thought that was a suppress move coming
[0:54:19] <atgithursdays> wait where did the sub count go
[0:54:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Then don't play it
[0:54:23] <%RyTYoung> Can you have a Goblin Slayer OP parody for your opening to season 2 of Mind Goblins?
[0:54:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Totally fair
[0:54:27] <yukichocomilk> nioh 2 is SO MUCH better
[0:54:27] <%LastHazzerd> i feel ya
[0:54:27] <%Frost_Quill> I played Dark Souls 2 before I finished 1, and I played DS1 before I finished Demon's Souls.
[0:54:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just don't play it, it's fine
[0:54:31] <+Tredecian> skip it fuck the gobolin
[0:54:35] <%BinaryFireball> you already answered it
[0:54:37] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[0:54:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I will pay you to not play it
[0:54:38] <ChoculaUltra> hey chat - is Solar Ash a legit EGS exclusive or is it a timed thing?
[0:54:40] <SharKinStereo> easy, next mind goblin, is do 2, then go back to 1 Kappa
[0:54:43] <+McSoliace> there's not much your missing in nioh 1 that isnt in nioh 2
[0:54:43] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Don't think I won't
[0:54:44] <ExpressNode> Nioh had me rage quit when I rolled off a cliff
[0:54:45] <%PatchTheSquid> I had that issue until i finally comitted. just forget nioh exists and enjoy Nioh 2.
[0:54:46] <xxshadowxx416> no
[0:54:50] <SaltyAzteca> No dont skip it. commit to the mind goblin
[0:54:58] <%RyTYoung> @choculaultra it'll be a timed thing
[0:55:00] <gslayer14> hey pat how about that bloodborne 2?
[0:55:04] <%Ynkubus_> You read it in chat
[0:55:07] <+tempestzephyr> I mean are you ever going to go back to persona 1
[0:55:09] <ChoculaUltra> sweet, thanks
[0:55:15] <Sotetsu> What's that smell? It's not blood. :(
[0:55:15] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Yeah, I'm a quarter in Nioh 1 and completed Nioh 2 instead.
[0:55:21] <@Ranryu692> people won't realize the problems with it

[0:55:37] <mikesapartment> what are the other 2?
[0:55:37] <scrumbotime> David Cage is actively shitting onto and into star wars as we speak

[0:55:40] <Sotetsu> That is very generous
[0:55:41] <General_Terro> well maybe they shouldnt have made bad movies LUL
[0:55:41] <%FunkyStreams> the prequels are alright
[0:55:42] <%RealThiele> SOMEHOW

[0:55:44] <mr_saturday93> The sequel trilogy
[0:55:44] <%DianaTheAscian> what's the forth?
[0:55:44] <%maskofmichael> David Cage and Doom
[0:55:44] <%dekkitout> Five... what's your fourth....
[0:55:45] <ExpressNode> Should have stayed a trilogy
[0:55:46] <%sporeian94> It's amazing how out of all 11 star wars firms there have been there's 2 that are good
[0:55:47] <AilieNovella> I mean... there's a Sims 4 game pack that is all about Star Wars sooooo

[1:00:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @plaidisthenewplaid its up to you but I did dishwashing first to avoid talking to people
[1:00:19] <%Logoth_> Ringu from the hit dreamcast game The Ring: Terror's Realm

[1:00:30] <@Ranryu692> Fatdog Mendoza?
[1:00:40] <+tempestzephyr> seems kind redundant, since there's already a japanese ghost girl
[1:00:41] <%CoffeeKaiju> seems weird to add Ringu right
[1:00:49] <Sotetsu> @dakuu75 You're not the boss of me!
[1:00:55] <%RealThiele> also as a dishwasher you can work high all the time and noone gives a shit
[1:00:56] <%Frost_Quill> @Sotetsu We have not-Leatherface and then we got actual Leatherface.  I imagine it's like that.
[1:00:57] <waltzqueen> @tempestzephyr yeah but we have billy and bubba
[1:01:03] <%CoffeeKaiju> @sotetsu that's what I was thinking too
[1:01:05] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> any culinary schools you can go to? during non work hours.?
[1:01:08] <%Piemen99> Neither do I

[1:02:15] <linSP> janshen
[1:02:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what's the target audience
[1:02:16] <+MidnightBasker> The people who use genshin condoms are the types of people who DEFINITELY should be in jail, no trial
[1:02:16] <%IamGrapes> wait, does that mean the pregnancy is now gatcha?
[1:02:17] <Zombrocom> I don't believe you
[1:02:17] <%MidnightBurst12> I think the game works fine enough for that

[1:02:30] <%Stratiotai2> yo what the fuck
[1:02:32] <%chiazam> wait for it
[1:02:35] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> roll for negative tests
[1:02:36] <Bakefowl> genshin players don't have sex
[1:02:36] <ape_hawk> they are a collectors item because they will NEVER be opened
[1:02:39] <%Aeoneth> Makes cleanup easier
[1:02:39] <heartlesshealer> we have Hello Kitty condoms, Genshin can't top that
[1:02:40] <linSP> good one
[1:02:41] <@ssjklyco> I guess they make a Gushing Impact
[1:02:42] <%kyh9> lmao
[1:02:43] <+wmeldrum> GOT THE RARE DROP
[1:02:43] <%EynoStiles> Anyone who plays genshin dont have sex.

[1:02:55] <+Wolfstriker121> i looked it up....its real...my god JUST WHY
[1:02:56] <Sotetsu> Only the orange condoms work 100% of the time.
[1:02:56] <%strakillias> It'd be a pretty good joke if you did tho
[1:02:57] <%NovaKnightmare> genshin impact players wanna bang girls??
[1:02:57] <%hairtoday> i'll roll on your banner girl
[1:02:58] <%baka_sugoi> 5 STAR BABY
[1:02:59] <%alternative_flu> Your baby had no impact

[1:03:02] <+Wolfstriker121> why i looked it up!!!
[1:03:02] <%Djinnazz> cuz it's shit
[1:03:03] <Treasure_Vault> No, keep workshopping it and get back to us
[1:03:03] <Psyramics> your baby is not a 5* pull
[1:03:04] <%dekkitout> "You said you had protection." "Yeah, rng protection"
[1:03:04] <penitentpendant> "Our kid will be a 5-star! They overpowered the condom!"
[1:03:04] <%kyh9> They're not a rare drop but I drop them rarely
[1:03:05] <%Buttlo> Hopefully your baby never drops.
[1:03:05] <%Faustgesicht> Your baby is a 1-star pull
[1:03:07] <yukichocomilk> babies are literally IRL gacha though
[1:03:08] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> gacha bitch
[1:03:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> slam her pregnant until she cries?

[1:03:21] <AllenDeadman> I mean.... the chances of a Genshin player getting laid is about as SSR as it gets
[1:03:25] <+Hollamean> he saw the no clip doc
[1:03:32] <%sleepystardewfarmer> the child is born and it's a four star
[1:03:33] <SaltyAzteca> Gottem
[1:03:39] <Sotetsu> The free weekend got me, too LUL
[1:03:52] <+MidnightBasker> Genshin Impact Fans when they use the Genshin Condom and get the 1% drop rate that gets the girl pregnant and gives the baby a rare birth defect
[1:03:57] <%DianaTheAscian> WHAT
[1:03:59] <ValkahRoctsteel> 2.0 actually was good this time
[1:04:11] <+Hollamean> horrible
[1:04:13] <%DianaTheAscian> It was a charge move???
[1:04:16] <SharKinStereo> For the Genshin Impact joke: How about an Image where instead of the colored stars flying through the sky, it's various colored sperm instead?
[1:04:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> BLERG

[1:05:14] <+Hollamean> of course yugioh
[1:05:16] <%Frost_Quill> @Hollamean Yoshi P got asked that in an interview and he laughed and said never.
[1:05:18] <%baka_sugoi> cardbord CRACK
[1:05:20] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Terminator.
[1:05:21] <%FacetiousAF> T2
[1:05:21] <%weissguard> ?
[1:05:23] <Sotetsu> Yuggy Oh
[1:05:27] <%TheAntiNihilist> Wrong
[1:05:28] <%Dakuu75> Yugioh? More like "Yugi-oh-no~"
[1:05:29] <linSP> the bullshit yugioh arc
[1:05:30] <mr_saturday93> @kineticzen read or watch season 0
[1:05:30] <ExpressNode> I used to love it
[1:05:33] <%baka_sugoi> basiclly yeah
[1:05:33] <SaltyAzteca> yugioh an
[1:05:34] <+healnavi> more like solar ass. gotem.
[1:05:36] <%RealThiele> fucking Konami
[1:05:36] <%weissguard> oooooooooh, yeah, fair enough
[1:05:44] <%KineticZen> T2 was great though, it didn't cause Hollywood to forget how to write
[1:05:45] <%kyh9> Mine is Persona 3
[1:05:45] <@Ranryu692> it was the manga, but yeah
[1:05:45] <%dekkitout> I remember Dungeon Dice
[1:05:45] <SaltyAzteca> yugioh abridged though
[1:05:46] <Treasure_Vault> Yugioh was barely about the cards originally. Yugi used to burn murderers to death.
[1:05:46] <%BigCoffee> psycho justice man yugi was great early on
[1:05:47] <+bluedude153> Bring back yugi murdering people with yoyos
[1:05:47] <%baka_sugoi> CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES
[1:05:51] <atgithursdays> Where's the sub count coward
[1:05:52] <%commanderapathy> originally Yugi was bat shit crazy
[1:05:53] <ape_hawk> originally it was a duel monsters game with VERY loose rules
[1:05:54] <%kyh9> YAMI JUST KILLS PEOPLE
[1:05:55] <%Frost_Quill> Yu-Gi-Oh was originally about a demon possessing a high school student to make evil people play sick death games.
[1:05:58] <Treasure_Vault> Lots of yugi murdering folks
[1:06:01] <spongeofmystery> Season Zero was messed up
[1:06:03] <+darkpulse703> kitty <3
[1:06:04] <%KineticZen> You may as well say Aliens if we're just blaming crappy sequels for existing
[1:06:05] <+healnavi> thats the best chapter
[1:06:05] <+bluedude153> That season never made it to the US. "Season 0"
[1:06:06] <%RealThiele> KAIBA
[1:06:08] <%maskofmichael> @Dakuu75 Yugi-Oh-No-These-Nutz
[1:06:11] <$Cthulos> But what about Dungeon Dice Monsters?
[1:06:11] <+thefancywig> its like a death games show in season zero its wild
[1:06:12] <HeroToxiko> it was a tabletop game LUL
[1:06:15] <+Fetrigon> IT WAS SICK!!! KomodoHype
[1:06:17] <%CalderGaming> so it was more like Kaiji with magic
[1:06:18] <+paladinstarbuster> Atem is a straight up killer
[1:06:21] <+Shady_Zaku> YEEAAAA SEASON 0!! It was on his hand and pure vodka lol
[1:06:22] <%vivaldiva> sounds like some jojo shit
[1:06:24] <%Faustgesicht> Dude the scorpion in the shoe gamble
[1:06:27] <%Djinnazz> why would he just grab the lighter??
[1:06:31] <tanarath> bork
[1:06:33] <HeroToxiko> they tried to reintroduce the tabletop game but failed
[1:06:35] <marvel877> what was that noise?
[1:06:37] <%maskofmichael> Then it became card games on motorcycles for a minute
[1:06:37] <Tracazoid> And that time with dungeon dice monsters. That went away quick enough.
[1:06:39] <linSP> keith the american totally shot himself
[1:06:39] <kingmemelord97> Dont forget mind crush
[1:06:40] <+polothegreatest> 4kids version is terrible LUL
[1:06:41] <a_mad_dragon_> dungeon dice though
[1:06:43] <@ssjklyco> cards and Friendship
[1:06:45] <%Dakuu75> @maskofmichael improving on perfection with that one my-dude
[1:06:45] <%KineticZen> Sounds like D'arby's gambles in a series format
[1:06:45] <spongeofmystery> @Cthulos It's just the same as Duel Monsters
[1:06:47] <HeroToxiko> Bandit Keith LUL

[1:07:04] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[1:07:04] <tanarath> Yeah, they work great as Tabletop maps.
[1:07:05] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:07:05] <+JustToWatch> can we make the flat earthers do a disco elysium world map
[1:07:07] <%RealThiele> RISE UP GAMERS
[1:07:08] <Estwilde> @RealThiele i was going to say exactly that LOL re-use them as D&D maps
[1:07:09] <%The_Protagonist> SHEEPLE
[1:07:11] <HotMafia81> Oh we talking about yugioh?
[1:07:15] <ExpressNode> Omicron came out into real life
[1:07:16] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Jesus I thought Pat started hosting Joe Rogan there for a second.
[1:07:21] <atlasdotwav> I lost it
[1:07:23] <SaltyAzteca> WELCOME IN OMICRON
[1:07:24] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[1:07:26] <%AHomeschoolDropout> It sucked until I realized you can use your mount underwater
[1:07:39] <tanarath> !uptime
[1:07:39] <@Moobot> @tanarath I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 7m.
[1:07:41] <%Frost_Quill> Remember the time Yugi blinded a guy as a punishment for losing his sick shadow game.
[1:07:43] <%RealThiele> turtle power
[1:07:50] <%KineticZen> The sequel's gonna be named Lunar Ash isn't it
[1:07:55] <%KineticZen> despite the moon not burning
[1:07:58] <+healnavi> but there's a mandatory swimming segment
[1:08:02] <spongeofmystery> limesDance limesDance limesDance limesDance limesDance mothDance mothDance mothDance mothDance
[1:08:04] <Byronic_dreamer> oh right the video game
[1:08:28] <%chiazam> Oh that's interesting, I wonder why he got it on PS5 instead of PC
[1:08:32] <kingmemelord97> umm did anyone else just get a giant bright red state farm banner at the bottom of the screen ?\
[1:08:36] <HotMafia81> Solar Ass
[1:08:37] <%FunkyStreams> Pat was talking about having energy problems, he should use Giefs piss for hydroelectricity.
[1:08:42] <ExpressNode> So just one question. Can a 2tb ssd fit most games on PS5?
[1:08:42] <+paladinstarbuster> monstah cardo
[1:08:45] <%commanderapathy> everytime pat describes 2.0, it makes me glad I came in at stormblood
[1:08:48] <+healnavi> @chiazam EGS exclusive
[1:08:50] <%RealThiele> @chiazam no EGS
[1:09:05] <tanarath> @frost_quill didn't he straight-up murder & condemn people to the void/hell in season 0?
[1:09:21] <%commanderapathy> yes
[1:09:31] <%dekkitout> @ExpressNode That's 2000gb, unless you want ~9 CoD games, you should be fine
[1:09:35] <%chiazam> @healnavi OOF
[1:09:40] <atlasdotwav> 2tb is a lot of data but I didn’t know ps5 had external drive support that’s sick
[1:09:58] <Sloavon> Remember when Yugi traumatized a thug so badly, that his soul reincarnated into a guy who became a police officer in the future?
[1:10:00] <ExpressNode> Oh now it's a Nvme
[1:10:05] <%chiazam> Excited for the actual PC release on Steam next year at a discount
[1:10:08] <ExpressNode> no*
[1:10:09] <kingmemelord97> @tanarath in the magna he literary destroys a guys mind
[1:10:28] <tanarath> I mean, hypothetically, many consoles have non-proprietary ssd suppprt.
[1:10:35] <atlasdotwav> Monsta cardo
[1:11:13] <ExpressNode> Glad Sony isn't pulling that Vita shit this gen
[1:11:49] <ExpressNode> Got a 64gb years ago for it and still is not full
[1:12:57] <%TheAntiNihilist> I’m still trying to understand what Pat means when he says he “know what No More Heroes 3 is doing”. Like, there is no way he knows what direction that GAME’S STORY WILL GO

[1:38:59] <%Alazull> Oh hey God
[1:39:02] <ape_hawk> lady, you need help with that needle?
[1:39:02] <+baldur09> were there other people who hated bluepoints remake? I feel like it got endless praise even though it butchered the art style
[1:39:03] <Zombrocom> Well. That was abrupt.
[1:39:04] <+dmbender> IS this an evangelion
[1:39:08] <%AncelDeLambert> V wants out
[1:39:14] <%Bailey__Gaming> what price ie this game?
[1:39:18] <@ssjklyco> is that Silk Song
[1:39:19] <ExpressNode> But you chose to go in....
[1:39:22] <%TheGreatSunbro> 5'11 vs 6'0
[1:39:23] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> like cute bunny ears
[1:39:24] <Treasure_Vault> I think most of this dialogue could just be a worldless cutscene
[1:39:31] <Treasure_Vault> wordless*
[1:39:52] <%blastyoboots> lol max HP reduced again
[1:39:59] <%Bailey__Gaming> welp that's a  fetish lol
[1:40:00] <Zombrocom> Is it weird that I kinda feel like this game would be better without dialogue?
[1:40:02] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I don't need the VA
[1:40:02] <%chiazam> I get the feeling you two have had that conversation before
[1:40:04] <rufus2k2> @Bailey__Gaming 18 bucks on EGS it says
[1:40:09] <%IamGrapes> real size pat vs normal size person
[1:40:16] <%RyTYoung> I wish she never broke your shield every time csbeastSetIn
[1:40:16] <Zombrocom> Just use visual storytelling? It's got that down pat.
[1:40:18] <%blastyoboots> @Zombrocom it's not weird at all, Hyper Light Drifter spoiled us
[1:40:25] <%LastHazzerd> this is more dire than Journey it seems
[1:40:25] <rufus2k2> @Zombrocom fake language/simlish would be cool
[1:40:27] <+Shady_Zaku> What an asshole this big space lady lol
[1:40:31] <+MisterAvry> you kylled the wyrm
[1:40:32] <%AncelDeLambert> this is an Epic exclusive?
[1:40:40] <rufus2k2> ye
[1:40:43] <Louie_Salmon> That would have been cool but I think they wanted to do something more ambitious after Hyper Light, which was already a wordless game.
[1:40:57] <%FunkyStreams> @Shady_Zaku she has like no reason to be as angry as she is.
[1:40:58] <%AncelDeLambert> welp, nevermind playing this, I guess
[1:41:18] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @AncelDeLambert also PS4, PS5
[1:41:20] <ExpressNode> @AncelDeLambert On PC
[1:41:21] <%RyTYoung> I think the voice acting is pretty good for the amount that their is in this game, I was surprised how much voice acting their is ngl
[1:41:41] <linSP> nah, you can escape a black hole as long as you can wing it
[1:41:42] <%Piemen99> Shut up space magic tech

[1:44:46] <%KineticZen> It runs on Rumsfeldium

[1:44:48] <%FunkyStreams> isn;t that the basis of Doom?
[1:44:49] <akitanito> what could ever go wrong
[1:45:00] <Daxalog> I always like this type of cosmic sci fi this and risk of rain have.
[1:45:00] <+Shady_Zaku> Ah! Bureaucracy fucks us all!
[1:45:04] <%Alazull> Do you want a portal to Hell? Because that's how you get a portal to Hell!
[1:45:14] <%KineticZen> The whole energy crisis on Earth thing sorta got buried in Doom Eternal

[1:47:28] <%FunkyStreams> simple game is dense af

[2:00:04] <%blastyoboots> weak points != caches
[2:00:05] <%KnifeyMcEdge> game is on PS4, PS5, and the Epic game store...
[2:00:05] <SaltyAzteca> Oh nice they fly now
[2:00:16] <HotMafia81> PS5 trophies are indeed an interference
[2:00:23] <%blastyoboots> caches are not on the scanner but they do have blue smoke column light coming out of them
[2:00:49] <%KnifeyMcEdge> item 5 feet away
[2:00:55] <gslayer14> thing on floor

[2:01:46] <%FunkyStreams> the ai is like wicked smaht
[2:01:58] <Louie_Salmon> For anyone in chat, PS4 version does have some lag when entering areas, otherwise it performed fine
[2:02:01] <TheeRabbi> There's NO WAY this wasn't artistically influenced heavily by Samurai Jack. The sound effects when enemies die or abilities are used, the black oily stuff but otherwise complete lack of outlining on ANYTHING, even the enemy designs are so, so Samurai Jack
[2:02:10] <silverira> is this HyperGravity Drifter?
[2:02:24] <%blastyoboots> Darbg
[2:02:25] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[2:03:05] <%KnifeyMcEdge> these bits are cool
[2:03:22] <%Alazull> Darb is a doge?

[2:03:34] <HotMafia81> Where's the giant, Mannsley?
[2:03:43] <atlasdotwav> Got screw attack
[2:03:54] <%ZephynM> This game looks like fun.
[2:03:54] <%FunkyStreams> I tell you hwhat this place dont make no sense at all, man
[2:04:03] <%ZephynM> If I wasn't getting FF7 on PC Thursday, I'd get into this right now.
[2:04:04] <DickieWoodsmall_279> femshep vibes off this voice performance
[2:04:05] <%blastyoboots> def slaps
[2:04:08] <+Ominnous> So like Gravity Rush?
[2:04:09] <%blastyoboots> YES WOOLIE SHOULD
[2:04:15] <Louie_Salmon> It could not be more up his alley
[2:04:16] <Daxalog> He wont. For like a year or 2
[2:04:19] <TheHeroAppears> game made for woolie
[2:04:26] <%Dakuu75> what was that one indie game that moved like this. but had no combat?
[2:04:29] <AdmiralButtloaf> this is wollies jam
[2:04:29] <%blastyoboots> YES
[2:04:29] <%cvp5127> he will in a year
[2:04:29] <Louie_Salmon> Purple, Jet set radio, Shadow of the colossus
[2:04:30] <%blastyoboots> I KNOW
[2:04:31] <%afronooch> yeah
[2:04:33] <%blastyoboots> it's SO WEIRD
[2:04:36] <+Draegen_> Hyper Void Drifter?
[2:04:36] <ricoashy> fax
[2:04:36] <TheHeroAppears> hyper woolite drifter
[2:04:40] <%blastyoboots> the title fits this one SO MUCH BETTER
[2:04:41] <%cooldude69xx> Drifting on the hyperlight
[2:04:47] <Sol_Install> man... true
[2:04:49] <%KnifeyMcEdge> ULTRAVOID DRIFTER
[2:04:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie should also play Unsighted, that game is MADE for him
[2:05:03] <atlasdotwav> UV D
[2:05:13] <SaltyAzteca> lmao that sounds like me
[2:05:22] <SaltyAzteca> "Ill get to it...eventually"
[2:05:26] <%KnifeyMcEdge> literally all my friends
[2:05:28] <Sol_Install> Sounds like one of my friends in discord
[2:05:31] <%alternative_flu> Do you have to trick woolie into doing it?
[2:05:32] <%Monkeyweed21> 15 YEARS LATER
[2:05:32] <Louie_Salmon> Well more importantly, he can't play something in the month it comes out. That would be too good for his SEO.
[2:05:33] <%BigCoffee> I lent aegis 13 to my friend fucking 1 year ago and he said the same thing. He played 4 hours and dropped it :(
[2:05:33] <yukichocomilk> i take forever to check out stuff too but it's not malicious LUL
[2:05:34] <TheHeroAppears> yeah yeah I'll get there in tenish years
[2:05:35] <ExpressNode> Ultralight Drifter
[2:05:35] <%FunkyStreams> he's gotta finish padawaning Reggie through the souls series.
[2:05:37] <%cooldude69xx> What if you describe it in woolie-bait terms without explicitly suggesting he try it?
[2:05:39] <%blastyoboots> just say it's Space Jet Set Radio by Hyper Light Drifter people
[2:05:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie be like "oh I really like this game, can't wait to get to it a decade from now for no reason" Kappa
[2:05:40] <%maskofmichael> Same thing can be said about you sometimes
[2:05:40] <atlasdotwav> And then 5 years later ‘DUDE’
[2:05:41] <%KnifeyMcEdge> "i've got enough on my plate"
[2:05:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> 5 years later Woolie is talking how this game is super rad
[2:05:54] <@PrefectusCorgi> 2 years Later Have heard of this
[2:05:58] <+ALazo> there are people in my life I recommend bad games to to make sure they never play them
[2:05:59] <+Fetrigon> @patstaresat when's unsighted lp?
[2:06:02] <susukouhai> LUL
[2:06:08] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat play it during the podcast,Force him to confront it with his eyes
[2:06:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> the moment someone recommends something is when I decide I will never touch it
[2:06:10] <@ssjklyco> look how long it took for Yakuzies
[2:06:11] <%BigCoffee> why is this more of an action platformer sonic game
[2:06:17] <%cooldude69xx> This was made by hyper light drifter guy right?
[2:06:19] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @atlasdotwav and then Pat says "i forgot that game existed!"
[2:06:32] <+Fetrigon> woolieSMUG
[2:06:55] <+Shady_Zaku> I know the feeling, I only just FINALLY started playing Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines a few days ago!
[2:07:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> schmovment

[2:07:47] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @AoiRob thats in the background
[2:08:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he snort, he snarl, occasinally he sneer
[2:08:06] <%Dakuu75> This game is like "Journey" but, with combat. Looks cool
[2:08:13] <+Fetrigon> jiyuSpin
[2:08:19] <atlasdotwav> Nightmare slain
[2:08:27] <%KnifeyMcEdge> LUL
[2:08:29] <@Ranryu692> lol
[2:08:30] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> so, did he decide the pillow should die?
[2:08:34] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:08:37] <%blastyoboots> he was dreaming about an empty food bowl
[2:08:41] <Parapattern> CUTE
[2:08:46] <%Djinnazz> aww did big abay have a bad dream?
[2:08:46] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[2:08:47] <%FunkyStreams> he probably had a mental overload lookin at all that light coming out of that OLED
[2:08:47] <%IamGrapes> poor doodoo
[2:08:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he's dealing with his own demons
[2:08:57] <ExpressNode> Then he ripped a huge fart cloud
[2:08:57] <tanarath> B A Y B E E
[2:09:23] <殲滅天使> this somehow reminds me of the prince of persia reboot from 2008
[2:09:31] <殲滅天使> with the black stuff and orbs to collect
[2:09:41] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @殲滅天使 its very that as well
[2:09:50] <$Jaxnos> just got in: is the combat like you changing gravity to do a lunge, similar to gravity rush?
[2:09:50] <SirPeytonius> a needle to the eye is a straight up not good time
[2:10:11] <DickieWoodsmall_279> these slime transitions are like an early 2010's cartoon network eyecatch
[2:10:12] <%Dakuu75> this game is only on playstation and Epic store... hmmm...
[2:10:34] <%HotSauceFiend> Are you enjoying this game? I just popped in. The flow of movement seems great
[2:10:49] <+Shady_Zaku> this Ratchet n Clank rails SHIIIET lol good fun
[2:11:18] <%RyTYoung> @hotsaucefiend he's digging the movement and whatnot, he said Woolie should try it
[2:11:19] <GamesNoir> When did Solar Ash drop!!!!?
[2:11:30] <%EySoyCoco> yo this looks super dope
[2:11:38] <%FunkyStreams> thats a really solid enemy type
[2:11:39] <%RyTYoung> @gamesnoir a couple weeks ago now
[2:11:48] <%HotSauceFiend> sliding up stairs is a godsend
[2:11:56] <Manipulator98> gravity rush vibes
[2:11:57] <%Dakuu75> Dec 2nd
[2:12:00] <Daxalog> Probably "Why isnt this Hyper Light 2"
[2:12:00] <FourthQueen> Dont love the voice acting
[2:12:00] <Louie_Salmon> Big furry energy
[2:12:03] <%blastyoboots> I think some of them put the difficulty too high, because anything above Standard makes the timed puzzles you've been doing FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE
[2:12:06] <%KnifeyMcEdge> nah, its good. only one enemy annoyed me.
[2:12:11] <%Saunt> so when are they making Jet Set Radio?
[2:12:12] <atlasdotwav> This is what a Shadow the hedgehog game should’ve been
[2:12:32] <%HotSauceFiend> @Louie_Salmon furries are here? in the game i mean. I'm sure chat has many
[2:12:36] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Saunt 20 years ago
[2:13:00] <%KnifeyMcEdge> got your cape back
[2:13:17] <+Fetrigon> I think those enemies attack where you're going to be.
[2:13:19] <%Logoth_> Looks like the hudson river
[2:13:23] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @HotSauceFiend i swear to god its the same universe as Hyper Light Drifter
[2:13:30] <Louie_Salmon> @hotsaucefiend Yeah there was a cat person a while ago, and that note was from like "Terrorclaw Dangerpaws" or something
[2:13:33] <%FunkyStreams> nice
[2:13:34] <AngryAsian5> Bless
[2:13:37] <%KineticZen> Sneeze combo
[2:13:42] <%blastyoboots> whoa you killed all of them at once AND sneezed
[2:13:45] <%RyTYoung> SNEEZE TROPHY
[2:13:49] <%FunkyStreams> chooed on
[2:14:03] <atlasdotwav> That was legit impressive
[2:14:41] <%RyTYoung> @blastyoboots it was the trophy and the sneeze being in sync that got me LUL
[2:14:53] <%HotSauceFiend> man what if Bomb Rush Cyberfunk played this smoothly. with the skating.
[2:14:56] <%KnifeyMcEdge> plasma bucks
[2:15:08] <%blastyoboots> @RyTYoung I didn't even SEE the trophy, holy shit
[2:15:08] <KaiserMario> Hey, is that Tali's VA?
[2:15:51] <%FunkyStreams> dont like how the buffer zone doesnt have proper clipping.
[2:16:00] <%RyTYoung> @blastyoboots what a psaBig gamer moment that was
[2:16:10] <ExpressNode> The ice wall was real
[2:16:23] <TheeRabbi> It's called edging
[2:16:35] <%NovaKnightmare> My god, the Black Hole was EARTH THE WHOLE TIME
[2:16:54] <%Felhad> Felhad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat, you're Pat! Got through the Endwalker MSQ a few nights back and now have DNC and WHM at 90, glad to finally be able to tune back into the streams! Ponder that orb!

[2:19:14] <Daxalog> brambleberries PogChamp
[2:19:28] <%Logoth_> Is this crestfallen man
[2:19:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Oh no
[2:19:44] <TheeRabbi> Imagine if someone just barged into your blown ass open house and started reading your journal right next to you, ignoring you completely
[2:19:46] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @Dakuu75 it is lol
[2:19:52] <$Jaxnos> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:19:54] <%RyTYoung> return to monke activate Kappa
[2:20:02] <+Knight_Davian> @Knight_Davian is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:20:05] <HotMafia81> Horse voice
[2:20:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh jesus

[2:20:12] <%LastHazzerd> itchy tasty
[2:20:17] <SaltyAzteca> Four Itchy Tasty
[2:20:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> Are... Are you reading this journal out loud NEXT to the guy?
[2:20:20] <gslayer14> going hollow
[2:20:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> lol read your journal numbnuts
[2:20:20] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn NotLikeThis csbeastSetIn
[2:20:24] <%blastyoboots> that's a sad look on pat face
[2:20:27] <tanarath> MMMMMMMMMM
[2:20:30] <%RyTYoung> the voice performance 10/10 btw
[2:20:34] <Daxalog> The voice acting on this book is incredible.
[2:20:38] <SirPeytonius> BRAMBLEBERRIES
[2:20:39] <%NovaKnightmare> Is this fucking hollowing>
[2:20:44] <TheeRabbi> itchy tasty bb
[2:20:46] <atlasdotwav> Great vocal work
[2:21:04] <%Logoth_> Mortis
[2:21:12] <%Dakuu75> ppl going hollow
[2:21:15] <HotMafia81> Damn, I wish she had more brambleberries :(
[2:21:20] <tanarath> ~Hollowing~
[2:21:21] <$Jaxnos> anyway- WHEEEEEEEE
[2:21:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> BibleThump
[2:21:31] <%RyTYoung> @jaxnos LUL
[2:21:36] <AoiRob> @NovaKnightmare nah just plain alzheimer's, i think
[2:21:51] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Well you gotta take a minute and just sit right there
[2:22:15] <SanderDCastle> New Ratchet and Clank looking good
[2:22:16] <%FunkyStreams> kalm
[2:22:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> person: experiences onset of dementia; gamers: is this hollowing?
[2:22:58] <%RyTYoung> I was shocked how the rail switching felt since you don't lock and switch to the rail like you would in SA 2
[2:23:03] <%Dakuu75> Sega, you should call Solar Ash devs, let them teach you how to make GOOD rail grinding
[2:23:05] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Gamers see a nursing home: IS THIS ANOR LONDO?
[2:23:23] <%RyTYoung> Since you've got a floaty jump it makes it easy to make it to the next rail
[2:23:40] <$Jaxnos> this is when i make everyone go "ew stinky" and bring up how this traversal flow and darkness goop reminds me of Prince of Persia 2008
[2:23:52] <%TheAntiNihilist> this just makes me think this is a less good version of The Pathless. obviously it's very different but the mobility and simplictic gameplay is very familiar
[2:24:08] <%RyTYoung> @jaxnos if anything the best thing about pop 08 was the traversal
[2:24:15] <%blastyoboots> it's a double
[2:24:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Jaxnos it's definitely got the goo
[2:24:25] <%KnifeyMcEdge> can't grapple to those oned
[2:24:25] <$Jaxnos> @RyTYoung 100%
[2:24:34] <%blastyoboots> boost-jump for your first jump into the goo helps
[2:24:46] <Daxalog> No timestop required
[2:24:48] <%blastyoboots> ooo
[2:25:00] <%chiazam> what is that thing
[2:25:02] <SaltyAzteca> Gamer Goo
[2:25:11] <%G_Thunders> I can’t imagine that whatever this thing is likes getting needles shoved in its eyes
[2:25:11] <%blastyoboots> @Daxalog you don't have to timestop to work here, but it helps
[2:25:25] <DickieWoodsmall_279> nonono see this is botw killing the eye made the goo disappear
[2:25:28] <GunneryGoblin> this cat moves FAST
[2:25:33] <%cade_calrayn> Wait so this is the same character from before?
[2:25:37] <%RyTYoung> Has anyone tried playing this game in the harder difficulty you unlock for finishing this game btw? it makes everything, including the amount of time you have to get rid of the goo, it's insane NotLikeThis
[2:25:52] <%chiazam> these people got fucked up
[2:25:53] <%RyTYoung> everything harder*
[2:26:08] <AoiRob> @cade_calrayn yes she is
[2:26:09] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @RyTYoung i might go back and check it out.
[2:26:13] <%RyTYoung> @cade_calrayn yeah
[2:26:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> mfw I'm aggrieved, strangely
[2:26:25] <+Ne1son> Ne1son subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[2:26:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Who's the dev?
[2:26:43] <%blastyoboots> one is up somewhere you almost went
[2:27:08] <%RyTYoung> @knifeymcedge good luck if you do, I couldn't even get past getting rid of the first goop, it wants you to get realllly good at the movement
[2:27:11] <AoiRob> they're just as well hidden as the secrets in HLD
[2:27:18] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i had to use a guide for a couple areas. the last two areas are easier to find them. theres a symbol on walls when you're near them
[2:27:35] <mr_sups> @fruit_pie_the_magician Heart Machine.
[2:27:37] <AoiRob> @fruit_pie_the_magician Heart Machine. made Hyper Light Drifter
[2:27:48] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @RyTYoung i thought i was good so i'll see lol
[2:27:51] <%blastyoboots> they're not THAT well hidden he almost got two more of them, just got sidetracked
[2:27:51] <%G_Thunders> Without spoilers- I’m about 5 hours I think from finishing Endwalker. Does it stick the landing, or should I temper my expectations?
[2:28:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Thought so
[2:28:06] <%blastyoboots> there's more back where you opened a "get back up here if you fall down" shortcut
[2:28:15] <%RyTYoung> @knifeymcedge so did it, so did I NotLikeThis
[2:28:18] <%G_Thunders> Oh thank god, awesome
[2:28:20] <Daxalog> So Endwalker can Walk the Walk?
[2:28:21] <%RyTYoung> I*
[2:28:28] <%Felhad> Endwalker was amazing
[2:28:49] <%chiazam> Well I guess this my "get a guide for the secrets" game this month
[2:28:49] <%NovaKnightmare> thats how I felt about being born
[2:28:51] <17crawls1> Ooh, this is a pretty neat lookin' game
[2:28:53] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The creeping dread of, but what if it sucks
[2:28:57] <%FunkyStreams> kinda like that Star war Eclipse trailer
[2:28:57] <SaltyAzteca> You only get one NotLikeThis
[2:29:00] <%KnifeyMcEdge> thats why i dont watch shows until they're done usually
[2:29:01] <%dekkitout> It's all good and fun till the Quantic Dream logo pulls up
[2:29:06] <TheeRabbi> What is endwalker
[2:29:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @TheeRabbi ff14
[2:29:37] <%KnifeyMcEdge> look for a circular symbol for the suit parts
[2:29:40] <SaltyAzteca> DO A CHRIST AIR
[2:29:42] <%G_Thunders> I for one welcome that absolute mess that David Cage will bring to Star Wars
[2:29:48] <+Shady_Zaku> @funkystreams doodScrub Ze bad gaem
[2:29:51] <ExpressNode> Tales Arise did that to me only that it's ending was meh but the journey was great
[2:29:55] <TheeRabbi> ahhh. I never really got into the franchise, didn't know they were still making new stuff
[2:30:10] <%blastyoboots> not that elevator shaft shortcut, the other elevator shaft shortcut
[2:30:13] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @G_Thunders I'd play it but Quantic Dream doesn't make games for folks like me
[2:30:17] <%bravebravesrobin> does this color palette remind anyone else of Soul Reaver or is it just me?
[2:30:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Any opinions on Tony Hawk retiring four of his moves, and selling them off as NFT's?
[2:30:35] <%FunkyStreams> @Shady_Zaku most likely
[2:30:40] <$Jaxnos> imagine if this had fall damage.
[2:30:42] <GunneryGoblin> honestly my hope for Star Wars Eclipse is that David Cage makes a game So Bad that it sours the public opinion on star wars, even slightly
[2:30:48] <Lilgamba> Im looking forward  to Alan Wake 2
[2:30:58] <%Dakuu75> chat, are you being chatty again?
[2:31:14] <%Ynkubus_> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid He's still doing nft stuff? ffs
[2:31:15] <%Saunt> what was in the corner of the clock tower?
[2:31:16] <%G_Thunders> @dickiewoodsmall_279 oh I’m in the same boat as far as Cage’s quote. I legit hope this forces Disney to reevaluate how they handle the games they hire studios for
[2:31:18] <+Shady_Zaku> Hell yeah! Space Marine 2 was an awesome surprise too

[2:43:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> hows the game?
[2:43:50] <SirPeytonius> does anyone know how long this game is?
[2:44:05] <GunneryGoblin> lmao every good boss battle ends with the player character facedown in the dirt afterwards
[2:44:14] <%G_Thunders> I can’t believe this game stole the mechanic where your character dies from dark souls
[2:44:33] <SaltyAzteca> sweet fast travel
[2:44:47] <SaltyAzteca> Oh you Cyd
[2:45:19] <Louie_Salmon> Oh robot character, how you misconstrue idioms for their literal meaning

[2:56:21] <SirPeytonius> big the cat fishing tho
[2:56:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> strawmen think that game is good
[2:56:23] <@QueequegTheater> But Pat, LPs aren't a reasonable replacement for a game purchase Kappa
[2:56:23] <%maskofmichael> Nostalgia is a powerful drug
[2:56:25] <%afronooch> But Chao racing tho
[2:56:28] <%KineticZen> Adventure 1 has at least some atmosphere in the exploration parts
[2:56:29] <%RyTYoung> Tail's/Eggman missions are hit and misses
[2:56:31] <+TheFlyingChurro> @DickieWoodsmall_279 No, they do
[2:56:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Shadow had gun, and gun go bang
[2:56:39] <%RyTYoung> some can just be pace breakers
[2:56:41] <Seth_Tek> the tails levels are super made out of left over assets. They never intended to have tails be playable like eggman in that game
[2:56:41] <%kyh9> Pat, it had Shadow and Rouge.  There's literally ZERO mystery as to why nerds like it so much
[2:56:50] <GunneryGoblin> did shadow have a gun in Sonic Adventure?
[2:56:51] <%chiazam> Yo VS Mode in SA2 goes hard
[2:56:51] <%AncelDeLambert> LOTS of people say it's fun. They don't say it's GOOD
[2:56:52] <+TheFlyingChurro> SA2 is fun sometimes, but not good
[2:56:52] <%kyh9> It gave us Edge and Bat Titties
[2:56:54] <%shurtal> the trashy fun parts of SA2 are there, they just exist along side of the the absolute garbage
[2:56:56] <%kyh9> What more could you ask for
[2:56:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> People say the dumbest shit you can imagine
[2:56:58] <@PrefectusCorgi> Like Rat can Swim
[2:56:58] <%NovaKnightmare> SA 2 would be good if it was about Eggman and his cheating wife
[2:57:02] <%Visorak6> IMO its trash or solid entirely dependent on the level
[2:57:03] <Seth_Tek> The tails levels where made last second
[2:57:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, did you forget that SA2 had BAT TITS?
[2:57:08] <%RigmaroleHM> YOO
[2:57:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> das a big ol monsta
[2:57:11] <$Jaxnos> the only reason it was even mentioned in chat now tho was because you said the thing that initiated the meme brainworm that has existed on the internet for the last 20 years
[2:57:13] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Imagine the dumbest sentence in the world, and someone has said it
[2:57:17] <ExpressNode> Shadow the Hedgehog wasn't a fun game.  Ten endings to get the real one
[2:57:22] <%chiazam> I say if I have fun with a game its good, I don't need to be ambigous
[2:57:24] <%kyh9> Consider for a moment: Rouge's tiddies
[2:57:29] <Louie_Salmon> I do not like that this one has a big third leg in front and between its other two legs
[2:57:30] <%RyTYoung> Vs mode in SA 2 slaps, Amy is too op and whoever picks her is an ASSHOLE
[2:57:32] <deliciouf> it was probably david cage tbh
[2:57:34] <churropoppa> @DickieWoodsmall_279 nice name bro
[2:57:34] <@QueequegTheater> People say crazy shit, like "No way Dark Souls 3 will have anywhere near as much fanservice as Dark Souls 2 did" all the time
[2:57:39] <%kyh9> Would YOU watch Young Sheldon with Rouge the Bat?
[2:57:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @kyh9 I will ponder this
[2:57:53] <%afronooch> @kyh9 yes
[2:57:53] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> doesn't look big enough for a boss

[3:03:29] <tanarath> It would fit well with the seinfeld laugh track, but it doesn't @rytyoung
[3:03:31] <hellfirejefe> with how twisty the maps can be i guess i get why there's no map
[3:03:33] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @RyTYoung kind of but the whole bit is still "this person is very intelligent and has difficulties fitting in"

[3:13:26] <phistymcnutz56> ayy pat first time catching you on stream, long time fan and i'm glad i'm still here - fuck amazon lol
[3:13:27] <17crawls1> Glad to finally catch one of your streams live!  And on my Birthday no less ^~^
[3:13:33] <%holydeviant1> If I was tasked to hide something in that room, I'd choose behind the portrait, or inside skelmo's cranium
[3:13:38] <$Jaxnos> "You have to heat up the passkey"
[3:13:46] <gslayer14> the burgers are the key
[3:13:49] <Lynxystem> i took my time and got everything, got 9 hours out of this game. So good
[3:13:50] <penitentpendant> "Seek- Seek- Bork."
[3:13:51] <deliciouf> lmfao
[3:13:53] <%RyTYoung> @knifeymcedge did you get all the pawdrons logs or whatever their name was?
[3:13:56] <deliciouf> the mgs key
[3:13:57] <Treasure_Vault> @17crawls1 Happy birthday
[3:14:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @AoiRob No, no, that's for when you come back to the mansion, the first part needs the Helmet key and Armor key.
[3:14:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> the key to the candy room was hidden amongst the toppings of a ham sandwich
[3:14:16] <%TheLakinessMonster> @17crawls1 happy birthday!
[3:14:28] <%G_Thunders> All of those stones in the wall could be hiding entire closets of candy. Rooms, even.
[3:14:31] <17crawls1> Thanks!  Had just enough channel points for that highlighted message which was nice!
[3:14:38] <%Piemen99> @17crawls1 happy birthday!
[3:14:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> You need to find the Toy Candy to replace the Real Candy or you activate a ceiling trap.
[3:15:02] <%cvp5127> your ass?
[3:15:10] <%dekkitout> Lemme guess, in a non functioning light fixture
[3:15:11] <Louie_Salmon> Inside you, where she can never get it
[3:15:16] <s1rcuit> is it in Geif's jowels?
[3:15:17] <ZawaAmaz> the chocolate would blend in
[3:15:21] <+rdark_ksu> but its so roomy
[3:15:21] <%TheLakinessMonster> not with that attitude you can't
[3:15:22] <%cade_calrayn> it's already so full of shit there's no room
[3:15:23] <%FunkyStreams> thats fucked
[3:15:24] <TheHeroAppears> paige would  find it pretty fast if he did
[3:15:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did you hide the chocolate in elmo's litter bags?
[3:15:27] <%cvp5127> not with that attitude
[3:15:31] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[3:15:33] <Sunstalker> Did you hide it in a case for glasses? Kappa
[3:15:34] <%afronooch> THATS HOT
[3:15:36] <%Dakuu75> I bet Pat has chocolate bars taped under his furniture
[3:15:39] <gslayer14> he's just saying that to put paige off the trail from his ass stash
[3:15:43] <%greasypete00> this game is making me realize i need to finish HLD
[3:15:46] <SaltyAzteca> Wtf chat
[3:15:46] <%alternative_flu> Pooping can be scary yeah
[3:15:49] <penitentpendant> We'd need Paige to verify
[3:15:49] <DickieWoodsmall_279> pat's rectal volume is actually not listed on the wiki page
[3:15:50] <%Monkeyweed21> it has an echo to it
[3:15:55] <tanarath> Does paige check the couch now?
[3:15:55] <%dekkitout> You saying that wagon couldn't shelter a small flooding village? tajRLY
[3:15:57] <auraoftheearth009> It can be scary how big they can be
[3:15:58] <%DianaTheAscian> gross
[3:15:59] <AlvinTheLiar> If you turn on all the sinks, the water level in the house will rise and you'll gain access to the 3rd floor of the house. Where Pat hides the chocolate
[3:16:06] <+valhallandoates> an empty colon is extra inventory slots
[3:16:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> Those poops where you walk out thinking "I'm a different person than I was this morning"
[3:16:18] <atlasdotwav> People hated Patrick because he spoke the truth
[3:16:23] <+rdark_ksu> I always hop on a scale in the bathroom before I feel a big one coming on.
[3:16:25] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> you can't keep the key and the chest together amateurs
[3:16:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> "There was a chocolate here its gone now"
[3:16:41] <$Jaxnos> i wasn't expecting to learn whether or not pat's ass was a 2 bed 1 bath apartment today
[3:16:55] <%holydeviant1> I like to think that there's just candy everywhere in the house, stashed obsessively like a squirrel, like in skelmo's cranium, under the couch, inside the cat tree
[3:17:00] <%holydeviant1> Just, endless
[3:17:00] <%FunkyStreams> unless the key is the first thing you find and its made of chocolate.
[3:17:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @doc_ock_rokc ah fuck, man, I wouldn't any chocolate from Silent Hill
[3:17:09] <%holydeviant1> Maybe even taped to the back of things
[3:17:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> "It's a chocolate house. I don't see a chocolate though"
[3:17:15] <+valhallandoates> depressing to hear pat's ass is out of my price range
[3:17:16] <deliciouf> dog
[3:17:20] <gslayer14> can't wait for this to come out for real
[3:17:40] <GunneryGoblin> pat has tons of hiding spots for candy, but each spot simply houses a single candy
[3:17:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> is this early access?
[3:17:54] <%dekkitout> Wonder how many books were hollowed out and glued up to hide jolly ranchers
[3:17:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt have you considered hiding the candy behind your breast implants
[3:17:59] <tanarath> What if there's candy taped to the ceiling & paige just never looks up?
[3:18:14] <%brisk_dacat> Wonder if gief will ever be able to do the balance a treat on his nose without eating it.
[3:18:21] <+valhallandoates> how would pat reach them
[3:18:22] <$GoopyAvocado> thos poor doritos
[3:18:26] <%holydeviant1> @tanarath Okay sure but how does Pat get it?
[3:18:27] <%G_Thunders> Didn’t Pat say forever ago that he hides the candy in old bags of freezer vegetables that he knows Paige will never eat?
[3:18:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> you should think about it
[3:18:30] <%FunkyStreams> what about in your beard?
[3:18:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he has no snout
[3:18:51] <GunneryGoblin> can geif's nose even hold a treat?
[3:18:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> @brisk_dacat like, is there even enough nose for him to balance anything?
[3:18:57] <@QueequegTheater> Bulldog noses are too short
[3:19:05] <@QueequegTheater> He would have to balance it on his forehead
[3:19:10] <RushUnplugged> the beard isn't save, Paige grazes it for traces of sugar
[3:19:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> First question: how much nose real estate is Gief working with here?
[3:19:19] <rosemon5001> this is the stream we find out pat has a collection of breast implants hidden away  for his collection
[3:19:25] <%TheLakinessMonster> you could try hiding it the treat within his burgers
[3:19:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Poor bulldogs too dense to swim and too small to blalance bones on noses
[3:19:40] <%brisk_dacat> I believe in gief he can control his treat intake.
[3:19:43] <%shurtal> if food is not in your or paiges hand, it must be in his mouth, it's the law

[3:30:05] <%Futurecity10> Yeah its just not impressing me
[3:30:10] <Make_me_mad> "You have to move on" says woman throwing life away for what seems like a lost cause.
[3:30:13] <tmvct1> not feeling the voice acting tbh feels liked the silence was a big part of HLD
[3:30:20] <SaltyAzteca> Do a flip!
[3:30:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> You did it! You... made a lady remember everyone she loved is dead again. Yay?
[3:30:27] <%notoriousvt_> it's hard to carry all that style over into 3d
[3:30:39] <Make_me_mad> Most video game voice acting could be improved by just making it Zelda warbles.
[3:30:44] <%Futurecity10> When you use unity yeah
[3:30:44] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I like the artsyle and gameplay. I would like gibberish language better. This kind of voice acting doesn't seem to fit.
[3:30:59] <tmvct1> @Make_me_mad 100%

[3:32:09] <tmvct1> I`m almost tempted to turn off voice volume for when I play it first time. Don`t know if it`s a good idea
[3:32:19] <GunneryGoblin> the idea that, throughout this adventure, the hero WILL NOT stop dressing up like her dead friends constantly is REALLY funny to me for some reason
[3:32:55] <hellfirejefe> now that they're dead i can jack their style

[3:33:21] <Polyceramic> why is everyone dead?
[3:33:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> @GunneryGoblin the idea CAN work, honoring their memory and keeping them close to remember them by while you traverse a dimension that's pulling apart reality so hard it collides with memory itself. But... here it doesn't get that weight so it really feels like cosplay xD

[3:45:36] <AoiRob> @trackles_64 jet set of the colossus light drifter
[3:45:49] <Jontman42> and shadow of the colossus apparently

[3:46:38] <TheTakkster> That's eva as fuck
[3:46:38] <FlongBongle> BibleThump
[3:46:59] <%mecha_11> This game is nuts
[3:47:03] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @djblue_shift its a lot of things lol
[3:47:09] <+trackles_64> we the bad guy
[3:47:14] <Louie_Salmon> Whoile
[3:47:14] <cherubs_anonymous> Wowl
[3:47:20] <Parapattern> Whiole
[3:47:21] <fugly_nick> It's a lot like Adam from Eva
[3:47:23] <Louie_Salmon> Wawl
[3:47:32] <Daxalog> 3 more notches
[3:47:35] <AoiRob> waol
[3:47:35] <%KineticZen> I mean, she's like a super angsty version of the upgrade saint lady from Blasphemous
[3:47:46] <SaltyAzteca> Turns into....solar....ash Kappa
[3:47:54] <djblue_shift> @djblue_shift excellent
[3:48:06] <+trackles_64> the amount of animation is crazy
[3:48:10] <Jontman42> turns into ASS
[3:48:13] <deliciouf> the real solar ash was the friends we made along the way
[3:48:14] <%maskofmichael> It's just a pure white, anime version Rin Yamaoka from Dead By Daylight
[3:48:28] <SaltyAzteca> @KineticZen Our Lady of the Charred Visage?
[3:48:46] <%KineticZen> Whichever the one with the sword through her heart was
[3:48:53] <+trackles_64> the cake is a lie
[3:48:57] <DickieWoodsmall_279> wow your character decays over time, kind of like that other game where you fight giant enemies
[3:49:02] <%KineticZen> Been a while since I played it
[3:49:15] <Elsewize> What's different?
[3:49:30] <+trackles_64> is ths PS exclusive?
[3:49:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats blue pat
[3:49:37] <GunneryGoblin> i think it was just the lighting
[3:49:41] <Daxalog> The cape is also full of holes
[3:49:46] <fugly_nick> The grass looks very BOTW
[3:49:50] <+polothegreatest> PS+PC
[3:50:01] <SaltyAzteca> this game looks fun
[3:50:36] <%alternative_flu> I could use chill stuff for the rest of the week
[3:50:43] <SaltyAzteca> tthat makes sense actually
[3:50:46] <%AgniBrandt> AgniBrandt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hope you're doing well Pat! Thinking about getting back into a bit of streaming myself; what's the good software these days?
[3:50:48] <tanarath> valid
[3:50:59] <phistymcnutz56> it looks like SotC but with heavy NGE influence
[3:51:59] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when Rinoa and Squall just jump into space
[3:52:00] <djblue_shift> yeah...
[3:52:10] <turdsman> that's about right
[3:52:19] <tanarath> triple triad, though.
[3:52:25] <%kyh9> FF8 is the worst for cohesion and character development.
[3:52:34] <%maskofmichael> G U N B L A D E S are cool
[3:52:45] <Louie_Salmon> Is there a mod that just makes FF8 into a triple triad game?
[3:53:08] <deliciouf> ffxiv has multiplayer triple triad
[3:53:09] <Louie_Salmon> Like you go to fight a boss, and it's triple triad, and then it plays the cutscene after the boss?
[3:53:19] <+polothegreatest> the man with the gunblade bitterGobble
[3:53:26] <deliciouf> oh lol
[3:54:03] <%AgniBrandt> Good to know; thanks!
[3:54:18] <deliciouf> no fart with reverb button? smh
