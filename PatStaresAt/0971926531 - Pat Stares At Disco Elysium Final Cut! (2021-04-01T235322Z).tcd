[0:08:30] <+chiazam> I HOPE IT WORKSSSSS
[0:08:31] <%walternatorz> You probably could.
[0:08:49] <TasenElite> That's Terrifying
[0:08:51] <%orcstr16> I still don't know how SSeth runs all these games when they can bork your computer like this.
[0:08:52] <%walternatorz> Not open world sand boxes without direction?
[0:08:53] <+GingerStrawhat> This is why I'm still primarily a console gamer
[0:08:56] <+Shonen_hero> PC gaming is the worst, I hate it. Oh, and it's the best and I love it
[0:08:56] <%MistyMntns> Give me to fix.
[0:08:57] <+oda_flobunaga> how about Roko's Basilisk?
[0:09:01] <bettysharkface> I have a chihuahua, and she loves wearing shirts, cause she has no fur on her belly and gets cold easily.
[0:09:02] <%SvenHolgersson> ONE THING YOU SAY
[0:09:04] <%GarbageNirvana> The ghost of Kenshi is haunting your machine
[0:09:10] <Nordguy> get a backup PC
[0:09:11] <@SoFarFetched> "IS IT A CABLE!?!?"
[0:09:14] <%AzureGale> Oh nooooooooooo
[0:09:14] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah that sucks
[0:09:17] <aiutare47> fair
[0:09:23] <dmtjinni> LUL
[0:09:24] <cardamomo88> i feel you
[0:09:25] <bettysharkface> "What are you eating" is the sacred prayer of all dog owners.
[0:09:26] <$RealThiele> buy a mirror for basement?
[0:09:28] <Dr_Mooose> the most terrifying sound
[0:09:29] <$dalmek> the universal pet fear of "WHAT IS IN YOUR MOUTH"
[0:09:29] <@ShockzNDrawe> he does it because you are weak
[0:09:29] <@SoFarFetched> "ANYTHING BUT THE CABLES"
[0:09:32] <+Shonen_hero> that would cause my blood to freeze
[0:09:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Is it a Devil Fruit
[0:09:38] <@SoFarFetched> ah the delicacy
[0:09:39] <TasenElite> that's horrifically relatable
[0:09:40] <+Shonen_hero> it is!
[0:09:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Or you can hear a small scrunching noise and it's a dog humping something in the other room
[0:09:42] <+Shonen_hero> and cats too!
[0:09:43] <%walternatorz> elmo spores*
[0:09:44] <+keyoray> @bettysharkface and cats
[0:09:49] <@ShockzNDrawe> why does your dog eat cat hair pat
[0:09:53] <bettysharkface> Why do all your pets eat elmo hair
[0:09:54] <%Monkeyweed21> not lethal neccessarily but will make dogs and cats very sick
[0:09:55] <marvel877> Why would you own dog killing pills?
[0:09:56] <Profmcstevie> Can confirm, hearing the cat making noise when I can't find her is spooky. Could be sneezing, could be throwing, could be eating something real stupid
[0:09:57] <cardamomo88> my dogs eat my table
[0:09:58] <Lodestarrobot> does zangief lick things super loud, at night my sister's bulldog would keep me up with him licking his paws
[0:10:03] <+Shonen_hero> cats can't eat onions anymore then dogs can
[0:10:03] <@ShockzNDrawe> COME BACK HERE AND ANSWE MY WQUESTION COWARD
[0:10:08] <DiksieNormis> psaDogchamp

[0:10:26] <dmtjinni> "LETS GO" -Dababy
[0:10:29] <aiutare47> Get one of those mirror Orbs they use in banks so the tellers can see everything
[0:10:30] <Sotetsu> You should ask Paige to marry you.

[0:45:49] <UnfilteredComic> Theres only like one way i know of to get that much
[0:45:57] <+Shonen_hero> I feel that
[0:46:08] <%maskedsongbird> You have to stage a revolution and trash the shop, just like Lenin would'a done!
[0:46:16] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat you see where the team behind Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden 2 lost the code for the games, so we won't get any new versions for those?
[0:46:20] <penitentpendant> Any comment about law enforcement makes my brain start up: "What did past me do NOW!?"

[0:47:41] <jorniev> DROPING ACID
[0:47:45] <bettysharkface> He suffered a lot, so now he gets the good drugs.
[0:47:46] <penitentpendant> Stats weighin' in

[0:48:35] <%toastybites> oh nooooo
[0:48:39] <TasenElite> Completely forgot about this thread
[0:48:40] <dukenux> nuclear scientists?
[0:48:42] <+Shonen_hero> basically they made a DIY nuclear power
[0:48:43] <cardamomo88> YEP
[0:48:43] <Pokerherz> Russians
[0:48:45] <+egalitarian696969> also people rich enough to afford the safety
[0:48:45] <aiutare47> this was a scrap metal nuke made in the fucking streat
[0:48:47] <UnfilteredComic> Yeah this is such a sad story that you only hear about from this guy
[0:48:48] <fuji_92> sometimes not even then
[0:48:49] <TasenElite> what a horrific name, The People's Pile
[0:48:50] <+Shonen_hero> YUP
[0:48:51] <jorniev> homer simpson is horryifying

[0:48:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[0:48:54] <+oda_flobunaga> Like Communists at say, Pripyat?
[0:48:54] <Sol_Install> Nuclear power is good but can get fucking bad if not done right
[0:48:55] <%Ranryu692> waiting *if you're lucky*
[0:48:56] <+RoByte2> "3.6 roentgen, not great, not terrible."
[0:49:02] <Fien111> Well a metaphoric bomb, not a literaly nuke
[0:49:02] <TrollKing96> So you mean it will never be viable then?
[0:49:03] <+JobbedBone> will it make money tho
[0:49:04] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Marie Curie just hang out with Radium?
[0:49:09] <BlueLunecy> Whoops
[0:49:09] <CursedNobleman> WRONG. LUL
[0:49:10] <tetrabrick1lt> it couldn't turn off
[0:49:12] <%Fooguwu> Although even if reactors exploded fairly frequently it would still kill way fewer than coal
[0:49:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Worse than a bomb tbh, just horrible fucking radioactive waste
[0:49:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Run and DESIGNED
[0:49:14] <+thelonechris> That and they put graphite in the rods or something
[0:49:16] <%whyskeywolfe> Watch Chernobyl if you haven't. One of the best shows of the last decade.
[0:49:17] <aiutare47> yeah\
[0:49:18] <bettysharkface> It's very, very depressing that talented people are rarely chosen for difficult jobs.
[0:49:19] <cardamomo88> SHE DIE
[0:49:19] <dukenux> yes
[0:49:20] <kazadaz> i don't see the relevance
[0:49:20] <%bread_assassin> Gosh, I wish people weren't so scared of nuclear power.
[0:49:21] <+projectmanatees> So homer j simpson?
[0:49:22] <aiutare47> and it killed her\
[0:49:22] <iosephe> They also fucked up in the design of how it could be turned off
[0:49:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she infact did
[0:49:23] <%THATGUY_789> the supervisor  wasn't there
[0:49:25] <%Undenizen> she DID. and it didn't go well
[0:49:26] <+thefakeh> she did, and then her whole family died of cancer
[0:49:27] <%Mr_Pylon> radium paints were all the rage for a while!
[0:49:27] <$RealThiele> she gets a pass
[0:49:28] <%코코꾸라> They knew how, but it was badly designed
[0:49:29] <Frostydough1> NOT GOOD NOTT TTTERRIBLE
[0:49:29] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah it was the night crew who barely did anything most of the time at Chrnobyl
[0:49:30] <%Maids4lyfe> she studied radium
[0:49:31] <+oda_flobunaga> Well, the fail safes broke tbh
[0:49:34] <dukenux> Marie-Curie's notebook is still dangerously irradiated
[0:49:36] <%baka_sugoi> oops
[0:49:36] <CatRidder> she didnt knnow how it work
[0:49:38] <kazadaz> pitchblende
[0:49:38] <$dalmek> @dinnydanny777 her notes are super irradiated
[0:49:39] <+evbites> She had to be buried in a lead coffin
[0:49:42] <dukenux> Radium and Polon
[0:49:43] <Dr_Mooose> she took one for the team
[0:49:43] <%MelBrooksKA> She had it on her nightstand @PatStaresAt
[0:49:46] <bettysharkface> She knew...so, so, much, about radiation.
[0:49:47] <%ssjklyco> Boiled for saffety
[0:49:51] <%MelBrooksKA> Radium
[0:49:55] <dinnydanny777> @dalmek I didn't know that part, damn
[0:49:57] <%Jekado> the steps for science sometimes is a risk.
[0:50:02] <%NastiCrimeboy> psaBig Bad
[0:50:02] <%bravebravesrobin> Chernobyl was also bad because NONE in leadership wanted to admit fault to their boss
[0:50:03] <+Shonen_hero> let me guess
[0:50:05] <+Shonen_hero> horrible cancer
[0:50:06] <kazadaz> uranium forceps
[0:50:14] <LorcaNomad> her remains are super irradiated
[0:50:29] <bettysharkface> Roy is a good man.
[0:50:31] <+Shonen_hero> for real Lorca?
[0:50:31] <+lordericter> this is depressing
[0:50:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Hey Pat did you know Marie Curie's body is STILL radioactive? ***.
[0:50:36] <cardamomo88> JESUS MAN
[0:50:37] <aiutare47> This is basically a direct Commie Chernobyl reference. Its a super sad story thread.
[0:50:38] <TasenElite> what an incredible bunch of lore hidden behind a "what's he high on" check
[0:50:38] <bettysharkface> It is.
[0:50:43] <SForlord> There was that boy scout that built a nuclear reactor in his shed. There was no shielding so he got some good radiation.
[0:50:43] <dukenux> Chernobyl happened because the reactor was basicly used in a way it wasn't supposed to, i think
[0:50:47] <+Shonen_hero> That's fucking wild
[0:50:53] <Dr_Mooose> oof
[0:50:59] <bettysharkface> Roy is a *good* man.
[0:51:02] <%maskedsongbird> Jesus. This sounds like the stories I heard about the cleanup crew post-Hiroshima.
[0:51:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> uhhhhh
[0:51:11] <SlippedDisco> called it
[0:51:12] <%Undenizen> THE LAND LORDS
[0:51:13] <+Shonen_hero> Chernobyl happened because of a number of factors, like lots of disasters
[0:51:16] <dukenux> I bet it was Dyatlov
[0:51:21] <%torusendor> Indirectly, sure
[0:51:21] <kazadaz> there's a small industry of mining steel from WW1 battleships for use in geiger counters and stuff, because all steel made post-1950 has too much background radiation
[0:51:25] <+SuperFineButtHairs> This isnt fortnite...

[0:51:29] <penitentpendant> The guy who said he "Has a theoretical degree in physics."
[0:51:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> no, no, it was the German nihilists
[0:51:31] <Tisaric> so yeah basically the capitalists
[0:51:32] <bettysharkface> Nice attempt to bring the humour back, but we're already sad.
[0:51:34] <iosephe> Damn capitalists, forcing poor people to build a nuclear reactor for their benefit
[0:51:37] <dinnydanny777> Now we see the violence inherent in the system! limesCorn
[0:51:45] <Lodestarrobot> I mean, even if the reactor worked properly they used to dispose of radioactive stuff really badly. some of my friends grew up in one of the most radioactive places in pennsylvania with a high rate of one of the rarest cancers

[0:55:46] <%BigCoffee> Even Roy wouldnt sell a gun to an 8y old
[0:55:47] <penitentpendant> She did call you 'pig' before
[0:55:47] <jorniev> he said a qoman
[0:55:47] <+lordericter> Who would sell a gun to a 12 year old
[0:55:48] <kazadog> @kazadaz nice name
[0:55:50] <+JobbedBone> no way she has the money
[0:55:50] <iosephe> Can she afford it?
[0:55:51] <$RealThiele> shes hiding behind the fence too
[0:55:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Would he sell a gun to a literal child though?
[0:55:52] <dukenux> ...but then she'd probably shot you, or wave it at you
[0:55:53] <dinnydanny777> My thought was that gun is probably registered and if it's used you'll be a suspect NotLikeThis
[0:55:53] <aiutare47> Would this guy sell a gun to a kid?
[0:55:54] <%bevyrage> the payout for this line is fantastic btw.
[0:55:55] <jorniev> he said a woman

[0:56:07] <kikoeru_san> maybe it's Cindy?
[0:56:10] <+pectusumbra> I have to assume he wouldn't sell it to a child

[0:56:24] <%bread_assassin> I can't imagine this world is so fucked that a guy would sell a gun to an actual child.
[0:56:24] <kazadaz> I don't think this guy asks a lot of questions but there's no way he'd sell a gun to a child
[0:56:27] <%maskedsongbird> Then why'd he buy it in the first place if he doesn't like hanging onto one?

[1:10:54] <%maskedsongbird> So what country is Martinaise supposed to be a stand-in for? They seem like some kind of French colony. Algeria, maybe? I kinda get Albert Camus vibes from this game. Like The Stranger.
[1:10:55] <+DinnerCalzone> ✋
[1:11:05] <%TheWinged7> but patuh, what about communism, not your playthrough OUR playthrtough
[1:11:07] <jestground> I've been just playing with the coin hands

[1:11:09] <bellwoods> !PHYSIQUE AT RISK!

[1:11:13] <%ssjklyco> Pats disco man and we are the minions in his head
[1:11:16] <kazadaz> It's the Paris Commune meets the USSR meets WWII
[1:11:17] <%BigCoffee> its a mix of 4 countries
[1:11:17] <Raz_Pataz> all of them
[1:11:25] <$Futurecity10> combination of Spain and French I think
[1:11:26] <+armormog> guess this is a monarchy then
[1:11:26] <UnfilteredComic> I think its like French X America
[1:11:27] <+oda_flobunaga> its fantasy Eastern Europe
[1:11:29] <+livingdynamo> @maskedsongbird brazillian paris commune
[1:11:30] <tetrabrick1lt> I think it's a mashup of all of them
[1:11:30] <Saltmeisterr> brazil?
[1:11:31] <%walternatorz> it's the country of Disco
[1:11:33] <UnfilteredComic> Its ild
[1:11:33] <%kyh9> It's meant to be a sort of Franco-inspired European amalgamation
[1:11:34] <justianxix> post war berlin
[1:11:36] <jorniev> what country are the devs from?
[1:11:37] <+aogman> no
[1:11:37] <+brightman42> it's not any really
[1:11:37] <%captain_thickthighs> royal so france maybe cause of the pronoucation
[1:11:38] <+illusiveSaint> it's a melting pot mess
[1:11:38] <%Arxel1> Vaguely Fantasy Eastern Eur
[1:11:39] <%Undenizen> COUNTRY! Pat you need to think bigger.
[1:11:42] <kikoeru_san> it's a massive archipelago so it's a bunch of stuff
[1:11:43] <AvroEltz> Maybe one day
[1:11:44] <fuji_92> France meets England meets URSS kinda
[1:11:45] <+livingdynamo> it's specifically in a 'new world' ala the americas
[1:11:45] <%kyh9> France x East Germany
[1:11:47] <@SSaryn> You'll probably never get the body down.
[1:11:47] <+pectusumbra> Isn't it made up and with like hundreds of years of history?
[1:11:47] <kazadaz> Devs are mostly Estonian
[1:11:51] <aiutare47> Its an amalgam of Paris Soviet Bloc and Post versails Germany
[1:11:53] <penitentpendant> @ssjklyco I mean, call Pat's Chat his "Army of Mind Goblins" would be apropos
[1:11:57] <%BigCoffee> Revachol is an odd combination of Germany, a Post-Soviet state, Manhattan, and Paris.
[1:12:01] <dinnydanny777> @maskedsongbird The name could be in reference to Martinique maybe?
[1:12:01] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt It took me until the 2nd day to inspect the body and I spec'd into PHYS
[1:12:03] <%thelaxinator> getting the body down is a long term goal my dude
[1:12:04] <+JobbedBone> theres a theme of amalgam and history crashing together in the plot. Its a delicious mix
[1:12:09] <DovaDude29> it feels like Northern france,  maybe post french revolution, but steam punk
[1:12:22] <+armormog> yea if you go into the lore it's more east bloc germany
[1:12:28] <TasenElite> it's only a long term goal if you're a bad shot Kappa
[1:12:34] <jorniev> they never fixed those holes
[1:12:34] <DovaDude29> berlin?
[1:12:36] <@SSaryn> If you're lucky and have Motorics you totally can but yeah, sometimes you ain't gonna get that body down.
[1:12:40] <%GarbageNirvana> This whole world is fucking nuts when you get into the lore
[1:12:43] <Ariddic> Kim has the patience of a saint to put up with this police man
[1:12:54] <+brightman42> but germany isn't an archipelago
[1:12:56] <+aogman> The OST is nostalgic as fuck
[1:12:58] <+livingdynamo> it's much more post soviet bloc, cause it's been owned by a neoliberal coalition for ages
[1:13:02] <bettysharkface> He's just drunk
[1:13:04] <dinnydanny777> fanfiction?
[1:13:05] <Ipsenscastle> that's the fuckin' Jamrock shuffle alright jeez
[1:13:06] <%GarbageNirvana> It's basically islands and land masses connected by vast swaths of, like...antimatter or some bullshit
[1:13:06] <aiutare47> Is he going to talk to the greatest NPC lady tonight?
[1:13:08] <+livingdynamo> @brightman42 it's not a real country either

[1:36:31] <+CptBritches> FUCK CAILLOU
[1:36:39] <TasenElite> her daughter is good despite her parent
[1:36:40] <sirtommygunn> small business capitalist
[1:36:42] <+MisterAvry> it means "The Caillou"
[1:36:45] <Crippl3> pieAnime I did nothing wrong
[1:36:48] <CursedNobleman> fuck caillou? LUL
[1:36:49] <penitentpendant> @SirGO0SE You expected the woman that took her daughter out of school to work for to be a good person?
[1:36:50] <Saltmeisterr> FUCK CAILLOU
[1:36:53] <%maskedsongbird> Le Caillou was the worst place. It was full of annoying bald children.
[1:36:55] <jorniev> man what the world is, its probably the most original world setting i have seen
[1:36:58] <cardamomo88> SHIT
[1:37:14] <naoi0> The world lore for this game is great.
[1:37:15] <Lodestarrobot> kaer morhen???
[1:37:16] <%SirGO0SE> @penitentpendant maybe she was a good homeschooler? :(
[1:37:18] <jorniev> VERY FRENCH
[1:37:20] <aiutare47> DO NOT SPOIL ANYTHING LET HIM TALK TO THE NPC FIRST
[1:37:21] <%maenos2> @maskedsongbird pat's homeland?!
[1:37:24] <naoi0> Mhmfh that empathy line
[1:37:28] <KaiserMario> Look at all this Qubec-speak
[1:37:30] <+Dova573> One Piece?
[1:37:34] <bettysharkface> Can we just appreciate the narrator for a moment?
[1:37:40] <jorniev> GOOOD
[1:37:47] <kazadaz> I hope you memorise all these names or you're FUCKED when you get to the Circus
[1:37:48] <%logoth_> This narrator is the shit
[1:37:52] <CursedNobleman> peak?
[1:37:54] <naoi0> Great voice, kind of wish though they had different voices for the skills
[1:37:56] <jorniev> GOD the pale
[1:37:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> direction I think
[1:37:58] <DovaDude29> LORE TIME LETS GOOOOOOO
[1:37:59] <aiutare47> azimuth are a direction
[1:38:00] <Visorak6> Celestial directions pat
[1:38:01] <Lodestarrobot> where's the graphic novel section
[1:38:02] <DianaTheAscian> this is a lot of lore
[1:38:05] <%Arxel1> direction pretty much
[1:38:06] <asurite_warrior> position coordinates
[1:38:06] <+twohitgood> is this narrated by vaati vidya??
[1:38:06] <%orcstr16> I love this guy's voice
[1:38:06] <bellwoods> god this va really nailed the feeling of a really fucking good gm describing a world to you
[1:38:07] <%pilgrimsayswhat> azimuth - the direction of a celestial object from the observer, expressed as the angular distance from the north or south point of the horizon to the point at which a vertical circle passing through the object intersects the horizon.
[1:38:10] <Ipsenscastle> an azimuth is essentially a facing direction on a horizontal plane
[1:38:12] <penitentpendant> Encycloopedia: "I got nothing captain."
[1:38:17] <aiutare47> LET HIM TALK TO THE TRUCKER FIRST
[1:38:18] <%juxtest> Shut up Inland Empire
[1:38:24] <+JobbedBone> @PatStaresAt its what raven in teen titans uses for her spells
[1:38:25] <+pectusumbra> Note, IMPOSSIBLE
[1:38:31] <bettysharkface> The narrator does so much heavy lifting.
[1:38:46] <TasenElite> roughly half the whole game, iirc
[1:38:46] <jorniev> @aiutare47 no the boat lady
[1:38:59] <PolitePolicy> I played this game back when there wasn't a narrator.
[1:39:01] <Raz_Pataz> I wonder if the narrator knew what he was signing up for LUL
[1:39:03] <PolitePolicy> This is weird to me.
[1:39:04] <UnfilteredComic> Communist Powers can HEAR richness
[1:39:10] <iunderstoodthatreference> I hope this narrator made Bank because gd
[1:39:11] <%pilgrimsayswhat> i love the flow of thought in this game
[1:39:12] <naoi0> I could be wrong but did like the final cut/collector's edition of this game feature a map? I remember that it had like a soundtrack and shirt
[1:39:15] <%pilgrimsayswhat> its captured so well
[1:39:16] <jorniev> jamrock its where you work
[1:39:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> This dude must've gone through so much tea and shit to record all this. His poor vocal chords
[1:39:23] <+lordericter> you are from Jamrock if I remember
[1:39:25] <bettysharkface> Somehow, I wouldn't want another voice.
[1:39:35] <%pilgrimsayswhat> hell yeah isometry
[1:39:39] <TasenElite> Absolutely not, he's perfect
[1:39:47] <sirtommygunn> Coal city never could have been anything but shit with a name like that
[1:39:47] <+OrangeMDT> Gosh, is this world just if France was the world power after some apocalyptic event
[1:39:57] <CatRidder> buy it
[1:39:58] <%juxtest> Put some martinaise on your sandwich
[1:40:00] <Aydarkzero> D:
[1:40:06] <+Jiggisnipe> fuck you
[1:40:07] <Visorak6> Absolutely buy it
[1:40:07] <PolitePolicy> I don't think characters had voices, either?
[1:40:09] <Raz_Pataz> having the narration really helps prevent the information from blurring together
[1:40:11] <PolitePolicy> Back before Final Cut?
[1:40:12] <sirtommygunn> its not alternate history
[1:40:16] <bettysharkface> Rude
[1:40:18] <aiutare47> @OrangeMDT Not really, imagine the Paris Commune got dabbed on by NATO
[1:40:19] <+JobbedBone> KINO
[1:40:24] <jorniev> buy it
[1:40:26] <naoi0> @PolitePolicy There was some voiced lines but not really
[1:40:27] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @PolitePolicy they did SOMEtimes
[1:40:39] <Visorak6> Its too cheap to steal
[1:40:41] <Crippl3> @PolitePolicy characters had some voiced dialog, some where nearly fully voiced
[1:40:42] <cardamomo88> CRIME
[1:40:43] <penitentpendant> HA
[1:40:44] <+Capt_Neckbeard> How "Woke," is this game on a scale of 1 to 10. I've always been cautious buying it because the only people I see saying its amaizng are game journo types.
[1:40:46] <naoi0> Honestly I prefer some of the old voice lines
[1:40:47] <+brightman42> change gloves

[1:41:43] <sirtommygunn> did he get the body down yet
[1:41:43] <+za7az> @Capt_Neckbeard You can be super conservative in the game if that's what you're getting at.
[1:41:49] <Crippl3> @Capt_Neckbeard it's one of the most politically driven games ever made, it rules
[1:41:51] <Lodestarrobot> @livingdynamo they're apolitical and don't like hearing about racism you see
[1:41:51] <Escherite> Nah like werewolf porn

[1:42:22] <penitentpendant> Woolie turns somewhere
[1:42:23] <Raz_Pataz> This game lets you shout "I am the Law" at people. 10/10
[1:42:25] <TasenElite> goddamn
[1:42:30] <%Fooguwu> t h e SECRET
[1:42:31] <$Futurecity10> @Capt_Neckbeard The devs are super communist so if you wanted to pirate it, they wouldnt care

[1:42:33] <%GarbageNirvana> YEAH MAGNESIUM

[1:42:48] <+OrangeMDT> @aiutare47 wow, I thought all the French, dilapidation, and poor government structure meant it was some alternate-reality future

[1:58:10] <aiutare47> Chat tried to tell you
[1:58:13] <naoi0> fine, time travel it is.
[1:58:13] <%dork_doggler> Not only are you failing every check, you
[1:58:14] <cardamomo88> LATER
[1:58:16] <$RealThiele> failed? or made better?
[1:58:18] <+brightman42> maybe you can find the key?
[1:58:18] <justianxix> just try again later
[1:58:19] <AvroEltz> or you can do something else
[1:58:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you missed a lot of dialogue options by ripping the curtain open
[1:58:21] <akitanito> "pee"?
[1:58:23] <@SSaryn> Yeah. A pee.
[1:58:23] <naoi0> Enjoy your iwzz.
[1:58:23] <17sevens> If you didn't want to bash your literal head against problems you should probably talk first
[1:58:23] <Mathochism> Convenient.
[1:58:24] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpShh
[1:58:25] <%Mr_Pylon> it begins
[1:58:25] <jorniev> peee away sir
[1:58:26] <sirtommygunn> it's not super important but you can go back if you want
[1:58:27] <+GingerStrawhat> Yes "pee"
[1:58:27] <%Jamejarrs> Whoo! Just in time for pee!
[1:58:28] <%king_wragles> Are you really cheating?
[1:58:28] <%cvp5127> sure pat
[1:58:28] <justianxix> Kappa
[1:58:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> we cheating?
[1:58:31] <Vermillion129> @penitentpendant Im not here to help pat, I'm here for the chaos LUL
[1:58:34] <el_patronn64> the guide
[1:58:35] <%king_wragles> Really? At Disco?
[1:58:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Convenient piss :)
[1:58:38] <AvroEltz> Pee scumming
[1:58:40] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> cheating time
[1:58:40] <Saltmeisterr> pee Kappa
[1:58:45] <StarkAvKnark> He voids his bladder at incredible speed
[1:58:45] <%juxtest> Pee Threshold increased
[1:58:48] <%bread_assassin> Something tells me, we won't be here when  we get back.
[1:58:48] <%maskedsongbird> @penitentpendant This guy gets it
[1:58:50] <+GingerStrawhat> He Tried, he really tried to get through with out save scumming
[1:58:51] <$RealThiele> big reloading sav piss
[1:58:52] <%blankwaffle> blankwaffle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! the biggest communism to ever communism.
[1:58:53] <%cache_22> I remember this "bathroom break" time from Yakuza LAD. psaSmug
[1:58:54] <penitentpendant> @Vermillion129 To be fair, his rolls are already betraying him enough for chaos
[1:58:55] <kazadaz> High Physical Instrument is honestly a really fun playthrough
[1:58:56] <naoi0> @Vermillion129 Same, I'm on my third playthrough SoonerLater
[1:58:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> We. Are. Scumming Dreamahs
[1:58:58] <+aspirationdeath> save scumming in this game should be punshable by firing squad
[1:59:05] <%DakotaMacDoodle> He gonna redo everything while on his "pee break"
[1:59:06] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:59:07] <jorniev> chat its better to talk first, you can always choose violence after talking in this game
[1:59:08] <aiutare47> btw chat let him learn the wacky lore before mentioning it in chat, its supposed to be a slow drip-fed reveal.
[1:59:18] <naoi0> Yeh
[1:59:19] <%thelaxinator> A lot of white check failures are just wet farts, unfortunately
[1:59:20] <penitentpendant> @aspirationdeath That's later
[1:59:27] <%thelaxinator> red check failures are AWESOME
[1:59:28] <user_naim> man this brb video is the bedt
[1:59:29] <kikoeru_san> watching Pat fuck up every roll makes me happy tho, however there is one check he has to scum later
[1:59:36] <OldManDeckardCain> pat's peeing suspiciously takes about as much time as checking the solution on the internet, hmm
[1:59:40] <%thedankestmeeme> waity is he done?
[1:59:40] <%thelaxinator> white check failures are just FOMO tbh
[1:59:44] <%thedankestmeeme> I just got my beer
[2:00:00] <Aydarkzero> small break is all
[2:00:06] <couriersix2000> he went to pee
[2:00:08] <kikoeru_san> like you can't progress unless you pass this one check
[2:00:13] <+JobbedBone> steak and weed BibleThump
[2:00:15] <penitentpendant> @OldManDeckardCain The beauty of phones! You can now do both at once.
[2:00:25] <Crippl3> remember chat, don't spoil, only smile :)
[2:00:43] <couriersix2000> but the Pale thing is rad as fuck tho
[2:00:49] <kazadaz> Has he met Measurehead yet?
[2:00:50] <%dork_doggler> Has Pat gone to the Tasks menu so we can see his copotype points?
[2:00:52] <Cpt_phantom> Yeah I thought these games were supposed to be about ridiculous fails and stuff, part of the fun
[2:01:01] <+JobbedBone> hmmm
[2:01:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> At least that like one check you need to scum to complete the game is rigged in your favor if you do some of the optional stuff first
[2:01:10] <%maskedsongbird> Luckily for me, I never played past the first day, so I can't spoil shit because I don't know shit! lol
[2:01:12] <$RealThiele> pat has failed stuff a few times already
[2:01:13] <akitanito> Mostly, some failures you don't want
[2:01:13] <Crippl3> @kazadaz he hasn't gone to the docks yet at all afaik
[2:01:14] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!
[2:01:15] <%thelaxinator> the fun and ridic failures are just red checks
[2:01:18] <%thedankestmeeme> i love that part
[2:01:21] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!
[2:01:28] <kazadaz> @Cpt_phantom I think it's kind of justifiable in this instance, he's just missing out on a bit of the game otherwise
[2:01:32] <+keyoray> love the reload, good memories
[2:01:34] <kikoeru_san> oh boy, Pat has low hand eye...neat
[2:01:36] <penitentpendant> RELOAD! ...that save
[2:01:44] <%thelaxinator> Some red check failures are objectively better
[2:01:44] <Aydarkzero> reload reload
[2:01:55] <couriersix2000> honestly it`s best if he reloads
[2:02:01] <couriersix2000> this side quest is pretty fun
[2:02:05] <Aydarkzero> like the shoulder check on the door LUL
[2:02:07] <+JobbedBone> does pat know that he can sell a section of his orb as an NFT?
[2:02:10] <penitentpendant> There's a lot of content behind that door
[2:02:13] <$RealThiele> magician was such a fucking quarter muncher
[2:02:22] <%Broand> Person who admits that he likes talking his way through NPCs "fuck you lady I'm gonna open your curtains!"
[2:02:24] <sylveonIRL> he's not locked out of it forever chatlets
[2:02:26] <Cpt_phantom> That’s fair. I’d definitely recommend want to try this game many times
[2:02:30] <%maskedsongbird> @thelaxinator Like the first one in the hotel when you bowl over the bird lady in the wheelchair?
[2:02:41] <+livingdynamo> yea the whole point of white checks is you can get back to them
[2:02:45] <+livingdynamo> getting exp in this game is easy af
[2:02:50] <%thelaxinator> Yeah that's basically the "failure can be good" tutorial
[2:02:52] <penitentpendant> @Broand To at least defer some blame, chat was 'pro rip curtains'
[2:02:59] <+livingdynamo> especially since pats a communist
[2:03:00] <sylveonIRL> and boosting skills is pretty easy
[2:03:08] <%juxtest> Fuck those curtains
[2:03:09] <sylveonIRL> Chat can even bosot skills for him...
[2:03:12] <+livingdynamo> that's like the best way to power level
[2:03:12] <sylveonIRL> boost *
[2:03:21] <kazadaz> Ripping curtains worked fine for me, but I was a buff cop
[2:03:23] <+Const4ntine1234> just started this last night and love it so much
[2:03:23] <PolitePolicy> Yeah, you can redo white checks, and there's fucking uhhhhhhhhh, I don't remember their name but they're basically perks, that unlock white checks an additional time.
[2:03:31] <zaxitor> Is Pat going full Communist on this?
[2:03:42] <couriersix2000> yep
[2:03:43] <%maskedsongbird> Who knows?
[2:03:45] <sylveonIRL> @kazadaz strong cop best cop, I smashed that shit down
[2:03:48] <kazadaz> Looks like it
[2:03:51] <DianaTheAscian> long piss it seems
[2:03:57] <couriersix2000> already has the Mazovian socio ecomonies
[2:04:01] <%dork_doggler> @zaxitor He seems to be going hobo/superstar with no political leaning so far; luckily, the game forces you into a slot by the halfway mark
[2:04:06] <DianaTheAscian> or he fell in
[2:04:09] <+MightyDuckShoes> It's Everywhere!!
[2:04:11] <+keyoray> @sylveonIRL but what about sorry cop. take pity on sorry cop.
[2:04:15] <$RealThiele> Robin Brain
[2:04:17] <%dork_doggler> @couriersix2000 oh, really? shit, musta missed it
[2:04:22] <PolitePolicy> He's absolutely going to end up a communist LUL
[2:04:45] <kazadaz> You can go down multiple ideologies (and get made fun of for it)
[2:04:49] <PolitePolicy> @sylveonIRL I got Sorry Cop on my first playthrough, please be nice to me.
[2:04:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> F1NG3RS makes fucking bangers and I'm happy Pat chose this as his BRB because it's so dope
[2:04:59] <rcand9> did pat get the info he needed from this piss?
[2:04:59] <couriersix2000> @dork_doggler well he doesnt have it yet, but its in his thought cabinet
[2:05:02] <penitentpendant> Game loads back in, "Hey look! The door's open. Isn't that weird."
[2:05:14] <+GingerStrawhat> I don't think you get the vision quests if you follow multiple Ideologies in this version
[2:05:14] <%thelaxinator> All the political choices you can make are equally bad
[2:05:15] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> I played a boring commie cop my first time and it's really difficult to roleplay anything else. Like, I want those chievos! But I don't want to say the fashy thing every opportunity, or else Kim may disown me
[2:05:19] <%thelaxinator> so real...
[2:05:25] <sylveonIRL> God damn sorry cops
[2:05:25] <+keyoray> @PolitePolicy name checks out
[2:05:27] <Aydarkzero> i can't believe shoulder checking opened that door
[2:05:30] <couriersix2000> sorry cop os best cop
[2:05:34] <Balay123> How far along is he
[2:05:36] <+aspirationdeath> moralist squad represent gang gang
[2:05:38] <+livingdynamo> oh yeah getting the fashy cheevos is so hard cause of the fuckin
[2:05:42] <+GingerStrawhat> I think you have to go one super hard to get the new vision quests
[2:05:42] <+livingdynamo> kim hates it
[2:05:42] <penitentpendant> @thelaxinator Doesn't the 'moralist' non-option choice lead to a game over?
[2:05:45] <rcand9> wb!
[2:05:50] <zaxitor> the centrist ideology probably one of the harshest on you
[2:05:52] <couriersix2000> imagine being a moralist
[2:05:53] <couriersix2000> ew
[2:05:57] <@SSaryn> Oh woah why isn't the curtain open oh wow who knows
[2:05:57] <sylveonIRL> i stole the boots and i aint sorry

[2:10:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> I’m surprised she hasn’t started hollering about astrology yet
[2:10:14] <PolitePolicy> For anyone wondering if they wanna pick this game up, my absolute favourite review - And best way I can describe this game - Is "roll the dice to figure out if you are a scumfuck man or if you are just brain in the jjar". 10/10, it's the best pure roleplaying game I've ever played.
[2:10:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think not wearing the necktie may make it stop talking, but I couldn't say for sure

[2:47:26] <%Undenizen> So, on any roll, if you get a natural 12, it's an automatic success. Natural 2 is a critical failure.

[3:20:13] <%Mr_Pylon> next time you won't get bodied by the body
[3:20:14] <%maenos2> turns out the body is yang's from paige's ff4 stream
[3:20:14] <+brightman42> quite possibly
[3:20:17] <Sirtimbob> I
[3:20:22] <Mattais88> Two?
[3:20:24] <%bevyrage> you do have the means to get the body down on the first day btw. it's just risky
[3:20:30] <aiutare47> @Valentinius_Anodyne yeah I remember missing some stuff
[3:20:36] <%maskedsongbird> S'cool. This was fun. Glad I got to sit in on a stream from start to finish for once.
[3:20:43] <TasenElite> you can completely finish the game without even looking at it, technically
[3:20:48] <Dr_Mooose> nice
[3:20:53] <TasenElite> there's even an achievement for it!
[3:21:08] <%ssjklyco> yaaay, wecome to "i bought a house" club
[3:21:11] <Mattais88> that's half a battle royale for a house
[3:21:12] <leinadtonu> buying a house battle royal
[3:21:15] <aiutare47> @TasenElite no spoils but how can you do that? Isnt that how you figure out the important stuff?
[3:21:19] <%AzureGale> Normally, when a person beats 45 other people, they aren't rewarded with a house
[3:21:44] <%maskedsongbird> I think I'm beginning to see the appeal of this whole Twitch streaming thing (god, I sound like a crusty old man when I say it like that, lol).
[3:21:46] <Sirtimbob> Omg i JUST SIGNED ON

[3:22:54] <T_Sasquatch> To duck on woolie, I just beat arkham city mostly blind on hard for the first time and man.  I can't believe they made a better game than asylum

[3:23:10] <@SoFarFetched> I assume cruelty squad was towards chat making the choices earlier.
[3:23:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm sure you'll get plenty once you go right
[3:23:23] <%dork_doggler> @T_Sasquatch looking at arkham asylum objectively, it's not too hard to create a better sequel
[3:23:27] <+Jiggisnipe> what
[3:23:27] <TasenElite> I have no clue @aiutare47 ! there's just an achievement for it
