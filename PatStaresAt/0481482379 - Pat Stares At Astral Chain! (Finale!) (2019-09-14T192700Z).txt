[0:02:08] <vVAstrAVv> i havent even finished woolies 3rd training arc yet geez pat lol
[0:02:12] <%StaceMcGate> @sampsonite_x File 11, should take 507 hrs
[0:02:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hello
[0:02:14] <eco419> Hi peeps
[0:02:14] <+NitronStreams> THE END IS NEVER THE END
[0:02:19] <+sampsonite_x> Oh I wanna go back and see how he handled that DT reveal
[0:02:23] <%StaceMcGate> @sampsonite_x 5-7 hrs*
[0:02:32] <+sampsonite_x> File 11 is ridiculous
[0:02:37] <+sampsonite_x> First time at least
[0:02:49] <+NitronStreams> welcome to part 1 of 100 of the end
[0:02:50] <phoenix7240> @sampsonite_x its underwelming he effectibly called it hapening
[0:03:00] <phoenix7240> so it wasnt shocking to him
[0:03:03] <+sampsonite_x> Oh he did?
[0:03:11] <+sampsonite_x> Fairs it’s not the most revelatory
[0:03:18] <+sampsonite_x> I wasn’t shocked by it either
[0:03:33] <%StaceMcGate> hardest part of file 11 was the chase scene, continuously moving the doggo tired my thumbs out on handheld mode
[0:03:43] <%brickwall35> Pat smells
[0:03:46] <vVAstrAVv> its like the first thing you see in the anime op so yeah
[0:03:56] <8_Bit_Badger> Pat smells like nothing
[0:04:05] <phoenix7240> someone used a donation message early on to ask what he would think a dt would be in this and pat said fusion
[0:04:18] <+sampsonite_x> MINOR SPOILS Hardest part for me was Asura’s wrath mode, kept accidentally standing in instant kill start window
[0:04:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yeyeye
[0:04:29] <8_Bit_Badger> oh no

[0:18:41] <Ajanimentorofheros> So you don’t like the dark skin?
[0:18:41] <+Darren716> The real pro tip is to use the Asuka colors then never switch off
[0:18:44] <+darquezsmith> all red SeemsGood

[0:19:56] <reonome> that was a terrible tip
[0:19:57] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That's not bad
[0:19:57] <DeoxysPrime> Or just pick colors you like
[0:19:58] <PrimeNeverproc> default looks better
[0:20:00] <%Chichen> this is how i do the warframes
[0:20:01] <Angry_Ev1L> ... fuck off
[0:20:02] <Blank9> or you just go red and black
[0:20:05] <%pectusumbra> alright, I actually haven't gotten to watch a bunch of these, so I'm going to actually skip on this until I can catch up or play the game myself. Have fun and enjoy all!
[0:20:07] <%dekkitout> Astounding!
[0:20:10] <%hntronium> @GobblesInTheMist The hit rush thing? Yeah he knows

[0:20:22] <%dekkitout> Paint it like a police car
[0:20:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'm with Pat. This is much better.
[0:20:26] <%Wrashis> all you have to do is use woolie's color wheel tech to dress up your water
[0:20:27] <PrimeNeverproc> this is how boys play dress-up
[0:20:28] <%rdark_ksu> Pat is had been made clear you bad at colors with your eyes
[0:20:30] <%StaceMcGate> please take off that lame police cap
[0:20:31] <Angry_Ev1L> I like this colors but still think pat's crazy LUL

[0:20:41] <rosemon5001> black and yellow fit either way
[0:20:49] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> get the woolie colors
[0:20:50] <%Tenebrae94> any new accessories? @angriestpat
[0:20:50] <NeroIscariot12> You should really not fuck with unlocked colours as they have colours that you cant pick normally untill late game when you unlock full RGB customization @AngriestPat
[0:20:52] <+Your_heals> Is the characters outline supposed to look that..jagged? pincogS
[0:20:53] <%hntronium> Nah, How's the doll dressup pat

[0:21:03] <ChamoCamouflage> Medic black's cool
[0:21:07] <gustavozxd> some of these looked pretty cool
[0:21:07] <%malacante> I like red/white on the dress uniform cause it just puts a little spot of red on your chest
[0:21:12] <%kiiiirsten> made it in time for fashion souls!
[0:21:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> black is too easy
[0:21:21] <%corinv> Hey Pat did you hear literally nobody has been able to legitimately find the last piece of equipment in the game yet
[0:21:29] <ChamoCamouflage> I meant Rescue Black :V
[0:21:32] <Blank9> just take one of them and invert their colors and take the brighter one one shade lower
[0:21:40] <gustavozxd> its eh
[0:21:41] <lionsignal> all terrible
[0:21:43] <+Darren716> Rescue are the best ones
[0:21:45] <%nmaten> you just said anything with color was bad
[0:21:45] <%torvicus96> military orange was pretty cool
[0:21:51] <%nmaten> and everything thats just gray and black were good

[0:22:57] <+alphonseisbest> they do
[0:23:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Or just lose the entire stream when they lose the pet.
[0:23:02] <Delenay> they throw them over their heads and are too serious
[0:23:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> KILL THEM
[0:23:04] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I'd rather have a streamer give their pets some attention, rather than watch a streamer ignore their pet.

[0:29:08] <hassanico1> Still can't fucking believe the sheep frogs are called Zeus
[0:29:16] <powerprotoman> so the fact theres a bunch of enemies we dont have as leigons really opens up the possibilities for sequels
[0:29:34] <%corinv> What would a gel type legion do
[0:29:46] <Mobilebeardunit> goo up enemies
[0:29:46] <hassanico1> Maybe I misunderstood but Legions seem like artificial Chimera, am I wrong?
[0:29:49] <%joylent_blue> our camera is special tho
[0:29:53] <+Darren716> Gel could be a type of counter attacking one
[0:29:55] <Mobilebeardunit> poison/debuff?
[0:29:59] <+Darren716> Like attacks just bounce off it
[0:30:05] <hassanico1> Like, sure there are dogs and arrow type chimeras, but ours seem way different
[0:30:07] <+BoboDaHobo> @hassanico1 nah, they're slaves
[0:30:15] <%dekkitout> Gel Legion would be a Splatoon
[0:30:20] <Mobilebeardunit> or just tank hits, maybe build up a big counter
[0:30:38] <+crimsonharvest> shame about all this dumb fighting and noise ruining this great music
[0:30:39] <graemecrackers1> pretty colors
[0:31:02] <%BappoSama> @AngriestPat How's it going brother? Enjoying the super alien slave game?
[0:31:09] <jtdobyns> I wanna see his ultimate. his legion mode
[0:31:22] <%joylent_blue> the hit stop in this game is AGGRESSIVE, but i'm cool with it
[0:31:39] <hassanico1> what;'s our devil trigger called?
[0:31:50] <%joylent_blue> legion fusion, i guess
[0:31:52] <hassanico1> Resonance mode or something lame like that?
[0:32:08] <mield916> has he seen death Stranding demo pt 2?
[0:32:09] <%dekkitout> 'Max Resonance'- shoulda been Legion: Unbound or somthin
[0:32:13] <Tersalus> I've been jumping in and out of every astral chain stream he's done, and I still cant understand what's going on during any fight
[0:32:25] <hassanico1> ...eh poseidon's pretty lame I guess
[0:32:27] <Tersalus> theres a banana slug now? incredible
[0:32:27] <graemecrackers1> Is Peach sleeping ?
[0:32:43] <Tersalus> no game has made me feel older and more blind
[0:32:57] <hassanico1> @Tersalus how come?
[0:33:03] <Tersalus> so many particles
[0:33:05] <kingdomtrigger> Hey Pat, any chance you will react to the FF7 remake new boss fight with the Ifrit summon? It's fucking amazing.
[0:33:07] <Tersalus> so much blur
[0:33:08] <joedatuous> can you turn off the damage numbers?
[0:33:15] <UnfilteredComic> I hate how the electric Gel is Poseidon and the fire one is Zeus, It must be intentional
[0:33:16] <%Chichen> YEP
[0:33:19] <%Chichen> Ability spam is the answer
[0:33:21] <ShichiNoBushi> YessssS+

[0:33:23] <hassanico1> @Tersalus well this is filtered through a stream
[0:33:24] <%Chichen> Honestly S+ in this game is super easy
[0:33:28] <%BappoSama> Hey Chat, does anyone know if Miss Peach will be streaming tonight?
[0:33:29] <%Chichen> @doggieo not getting hit barely matters
[0:33:36] <%SilverDevilfish> This game gives zero shits about being hit 90% of the time
[0:33:37] <Kongro_> @AngriestPat You gonna watch the liveletter later?

[0:42:05] <%wydamn> And now that you've killed them, their art has tripled in value.
[0:42:06] <%corinv> You can autobind them for an easy s+
[0:42:08] <$iaraCatunda> I hate this
[0:42:12] <Flarepulse> sequel hook to catch these graffiti randos
[0:42:13] <+BoboDaHobo> you'll never see us again, but maybe we'll see you again

[0:42:27] <Mendin> Maximum Doggo

[0:42:30] <Tucker0603> is Axe max rank?
[0:42:34] <%kyh9> No
[0:42:34] <Blank9> arm has a good one
[0:42:39] <AwesomeDan_> Theres a few premiums in this file.
[0:42:43] <$iaraCatunda> Platinum doesn't think grafitti is art confirmed
[0:42:43] <%wydamn> @hassanico1 Arm Legion has a Black Hole attack
[0:42:52] <%Sokumotanaka> @Flarepulse Sequel hook to BE one of these graffiti randos with a legion.
[0:42:58] <joedatuous> grafitti isn't art
[0:42:59] <hassanico1> Ah it's ultimate attacks for each of 'em? @wydamn
[0:43:02] <%joylent_blue> arm get apatBig
[0:43:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> they look like a Caballah
[0:43:14] <beetbo2> BIG Arm
[0:43:17] <joedatuous> only gross woolies thin grafitti is art
[0:43:19] <%joylent_blue> i like how the max level is CX
[0:43:22] <Flarepulse> Jet Set Radio: Advanced Warfare
[0:43:29] <Mendin> Considering how Not-Evangelion this anime is, that makes sense Turtles
[0:43:31] <%wydamn> @hassanico1 Don't know off the top of my head, Arm is the only one I've maxed out so far
[0:43:35] <$iaraCatunda> are these legion colors custom ???
[0:43:39] <hassanico1> Yes
[0:43:48] <+Darren716> Also Pat the slime for this level is in the gutter
[0:43:51] <+Darren716> In this area
[0:44:05] <$iaraCatunda> good taste pat
[0:44:06] <+Darren716> And im pretty sure its the Asuka one
[0:44:20] <Hellarussian> is that Blade Wolf?
[0:44:23] <hassanico1> My favorite Legion color is lime puke green
[0:44:29] <joedatuous> pats body shape is weird
[0:44:32] <joedatuous> why is it like that
[0:44:37] <%wydamn> Also pro tip: Equip Hit Rush on 2 or 3 legions, and make them the same colour to remind yourself which ones have Hit Rush.
[0:44:41] <%joylent_blue> your body shape is weird
[0:44:42] <Mendin> It's friender
[0:44:46] <$iaraCatunda> my legions are colored like Za Warudo
[0:44:47] <%Keyd00d> literally sick man
[0:44:55] <%dekkitout> Heal him with hugs
[0:45:11] <hassanico1> The heck was that stance

[0:45:23] <ShichiNoBushi> What Lappy items do you have so far?
[0:45:23] <%arancet> goddamn windows update, it reset my sound settings
[0:45:26] <beetbo2> he needs the Lappy

[0:46:37] <hassanico1> Do we get to see a Hades Chimera?
[0:46:38] <joedatuous> the music in this seems good but it kinda feels like a step down from automata from what i've heard
[0:46:39] <KaliasTV> Gravity move lasts for so long
[0:46:42] <%joylent_blue> Arm VS Arm
[0:46:50] <Mendin> We've seen it already, I think.
[0:46:53] <%Keyd00d> @joedatuous well that's just not fair
[0:46:58] <StonerStan101> STAR HANDCUFFS! DONUT! DONUT! DONUT!

[0:47:05] <%Sokumotanaka> [ARMS]
[0:47:06] <joedatuous> how is it not fair?
[0:47:14] <Mendin> No the frog was Poseidon, I forget what the hades-type was
[0:47:20] <%Keyd00d> Nothing can beat Nier music
[0:47:24] <hassanico1> Zeus was also a frog is why I asked
[0:47:31] <WRFWD> I think you haven't scanned this enemy
[0:47:35] <joedatuous> hmm
[0:47:36] <%wydamn> Hey @AngriestPat , use your IRIS and look down.
[0:47:50] <PrimeNeverproc> why not devil trigger?
[0:47:52] <Hellarussian> that was just a jobber?
[0:48:00] <%Keyd00d> devil trigger takes years to recharge
[0:48:01] <hassanico1> @PrimeNeverproc apparently it takes forever to build up
[0:48:03] <%joylent_blue> unmarked battles monkaS
[0:48:04] <%malacante> downer than that
[0:48:13] <%wydamn> Oh, I thought that there was a snake chimera underneath this spot
[0:48:15] <PrimeNeverproc> well thats a shame
[0:48:15] <hassanico1> Like, once per chapter to build the gauge @PrimeNeverproc
[0:48:19] <Mendin> ...Maybe we didnt see a Hades
[0:48:24] <WRFWD> This was the boss from the bike level
[0:48:30] <%Keyd00d> There's supposed to be a bigger fight here
[0:48:31] <%Sokumotanaka> you can change the iris's voice?
[0:48:35] <%wydamn> There should be a chimera underground but maybe it has to be triggered
[0:48:36] <+OUTheTeam> getting location mixed up theres a boss a little farther
[0:48:38] <doggieo> DIG UP
[0:48:41] <%malacante> Huh, I remeber there being a big serpent-type buried under the ground here
[0:48:43] <%Laecerelius> shrug
[0:48:46] <reonome> 3
[0:48:46] <%Keyd00d> odd
[0:48:51] <%king_wragles> No @AngriestPat , go down than your downest down
[0:48:54] <+OUTheTeam> not here
[0:48:55] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat There's a thing in the ground but the location is random.
[0:49:00] <%Divryne> You have to roam a bit.
[0:49:02] <+BurkeBigsby> Pretty sure it's north south atpSuspect
[0:49:03] <%Keyd00d> Oh it's random
[0:49:05] <%arancet> dog only snidds when holding zr
[0:49:08] <WRFWD> There's a chimera underground, but not in this part of the map
[0:49:08] <+CharredChord> The chimera can show up in a bunch of places
[0:49:08] <%arancet> sniffs*
[0:49:09] <Charlie_Decker> if the chimera was there you'd see it on the minimap, that's how i saw it.
[0:49:21] <WRFWD> You'll notice something looks wrong
[0:49:25] <doggieo> oh it was always there for me
[0:49:25] <%wydamn> @WRFWD It was for me, so it must be indeed random
[0:49:26] <+OUTheTeam> it's in a little open space beforr a stair case
[0:49:28] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Look for the big open places.
[0:49:28] <%joylent_blue> oh i know what he's talking about, yeah it'll show up with the Doggo's sniffing
[0:49:35] <TCCBros> You gotta push he bus
[0:49:38] <%DeathsDoom> sure you all arent thinking of file 10
[0:49:48] <joedatuous> is this another game where the visuals are fucked cus detective vision?
[0:49:55] <hassanico1> For a final level this seems weirdly chill
[0:49:55] <%joylent_blue> i'm pretty sure its File 11
[0:50:09] <WRFWD> There is a hidden enemy underground in this level, but not in that part of the map
[0:50:12] <hassanico1> Is the actual combat part of File 11 just a boss rush or something?
[0:50:18] <%arancet> @hassanico1 mission hasnt really started yet
[0:50:19] <%Keyd00d> That's where it was for me
[0:50:34] <+OUTheTeam> i think its after the next alley
[0:50:39] <$iaraCatunda> is pat aware that he says bitch after every enemy he kills
[0:50:42] <joedatuous> nerv
[0:50:42] <%joylent_blue> god the IRIS voice keeps sounding like Garrus
[0:50:49] <+Karasseram> End of evangelion
[0:50:59] <%wydamn> If you paint Arrow Legion red it moves faster
[0:51:17] <%HRDSalami654> Don't forget to put flames on it too.
[0:51:26] <joedatuous> have you jerked off on your comatose sister yet?
[0:51:41] <hassanico1> @joedatuous we gave her peach soup made from bones
[0:51:46] <%joylent_blue> Jebaited
[0:51:48] <%wydamn> The Chimera has TROLLED you
[0:51:49] <%dekkitout> There was a scene where the sister was hospitalized earlier LUL
[0:51:51] <joedatuous> guess thats close enough
[0:52:05] <hassanico1> @joedatuous it was to make her skin smoother apparently
[0:52:06] <TranquilTurnip> Pat why have the last 3 streams said finale, is this games end game very ambiguous
[0:52:08] <%wydamn> @joedatuous that, and then there's all the clones too
[0:52:09] <joedatuous> just pour the soup right on her
[0:52:15] <+BurkeBigsby> Worst parts of framerate dimension
[0:52:16] <%Keyd00d> this was a bit annoying
[0:52:22] <WRFWD> Whatever you do, don't activate that mechanism until you know you're done exploring this area
[0:52:24] <hassanico1> FIND THE GIRLFRIEND
[0:52:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I feel attacked
[0:52:27] <DotDusk> Oh no.
[0:52:29] <beetbo2> just like in real life
[0:52:30] <%Keyd00d> That's the hardest side quest ever
[0:52:30] <hassanico1> Wow game
[0:52:31] <hassanico1> rude
[0:52:32] <doggieo> Best cosmetic in game here
[0:52:35] <%Keyd00d> Impossible to complete
[0:52:37] <+crimsonharvest> tfw no big blade alien ghost gf
[0:52:38] <Hellarussian> the hardest quest in the game
[0:52:38] <+mcjimbo12> TranquilTurnip nah he's just doing every side-mish and exhausting every dialogue option, this is the last mission
[0:52:40] <joedatuous> gotta rub it into the pours
[0:53:01] <%wydamn> @beetbo2 Main, that objective indicator is always in the top corner of my vision
[0:53:15] <TranquilTurnip> @mcjimbo12 ah okay, what I thought was that the game kept pushing the goal posts back and every stream it was like "okay now THIS ONE is the last mission"
[0:53:22] <joedatuous> only if your character could jump
[0:53:40] <ChamoCamouflage> use your levitation
[0:53:42] <hassanico1> The Astral Pain could have used a couple different themes in it
[0:53:46] <%Wrashis> i cant believe pat has found 30% of "the girlfriend
[0:53:46] <hassanico1> Plain*
[0:53:49] <TranquilTurnip> big big FPS dimension
[0:54:07] <joedatuous> tbh these stages look kinda boring
[0:54:07] <%joylent_blue> Astral Pain, not to be confused with Phantom Pain
[0:54:09] <+OUTheTeam> not rlly just this and getting to the boss
[0:54:27] <joedatuous> ive just seen so many geometric scifi lands already
[0:54:35] <UnfilteredComic> Hate this part, took me like 7 minutes
[0:54:36] <TranquilTurnip> Is it true that the Arm Legion is bad?
[0:54:40] <WRFWD> You can drop there from the other floor, it's easier but you still need to do the trip back with the platform
[0:54:45] <%joylent_blue> no? arm legion is fantastic
[0:54:46] <TranquilTurnip> Its my favorite looking one FeelsBadMan
[0:54:48] <%wydamn> My favorite thing about the Astral Plane are the ghostly red silhouettes walking into the red crystals. You don't actually know what's happening but you know it's gotta be fucked up.
[0:54:53] <+mcjimbo12> joedatuous the pacing on this game is really weird, the sections in the framerate dimension look kinda samey when you're just watching a stream but the game is fun
[0:55:12] <TranquilTurnip> Oh cool FeelsGoodMan @joylent_blue there was a whole chat telling a different streamer it never gets good
[0:55:27] <+BurkeBigsby> Still don;t get why this game runs like ass. It ain't a looker compared to Bayo 2.
[0:55:37] <%Wrashis> i dont personally like arm legion but i cant deny that its pretty good
[0:55:38] <%joylent_blue> TranquilTurnip wtf it's Gravity Bomb attack is one of the best abilities
[0:55:47] <WRFWD> Well, now that you cleaned the room get ready for some shit
[0:55:51] <joedatuous> but streams tho
[0:55:54] <Hellarussian> oh
[0:55:56] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Fuckin HATED this part
[0:55:59] <TranquilTurnip> Maybe one person said it was bad and a bunch of people who haven't played jumped on the bandwagon
[0:56:01] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat more like the bitrate dimension
[0:56:01] <joedatuous> we should be winning things by watching
[0:56:02] <%wydamn> Yeah, deal with that shit
[0:56:04] <+Darren716> Oh yeah fuck this part
[0:56:07] <%corinv> Arm Legion's great for crowd control
[0:56:24] <+Darren716> This part is the reason i had no full heals left at the end of the mission
[0:56:26] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:56:28] <+Darren716> Well part of it
[0:56:34] <%Capta1n_H3nry> So long gay bowser
[0:56:36] <%valriot> @angriestpat Do you have a doggo form when you DT?
[0:56:40] <%Keyd00d> apatHoldon
[0:56:40] <$iaraCatunda> I hate dog platforming, I die SO much
[0:56:43] <%Wrashis> pat needs time stop for this
[0:56:44] <Hellarussian> LUL
[0:56:45] <%arancet> bit rate isnt kind to this game overall, looks much better in person
[0:56:46] <+Darren716> LUL
[0:56:53] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Why does it kill your legion by touching it
[0:56:59] <%malacante> did your legion just get crushed against you
[0:57:00] <joedatuous> shut up
[0:57:01] <%joylent_blue> i guess i got lucky when i did this LUL
[0:57:02] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Makes no sense
[0:57:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Be the leaf
[0:57:18] <+Machomanohyeeaa> Love this part
[0:57:21] <%Keyd00d> this isn't even the worst of it if you want to get the optional stuff
[0:57:22] <+OUTheTeam> you can hop straight across, how I did it
[0:57:26] <Hellarussian> you do it
[0:57:27] <%valriot> Fights demons and gods. Can't defeat THE BLOCKS
[0:57:29] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:57:29] <+OUTheTeam> clap
[0:57:32] <WRFWD> You can jump ON the blocks
[0:57:33] <%Keyd00d> which he skipped
[0:57:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Become as frogs!
[0:57:40] <WRFWD> There's a holo mask
[0:57:42] <doggieo> noooooo
[0:57:43] <%wydamn> Girlfriend Acquired.
[0:57:47] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Become as Goblins
[0:57:48] <WRFWD> Well, there was, now you cant go back
[0:57:56] <MSN04_Sazabi> Sounds like Paige Kappa
[0:57:57] <KaliasTV> Porridge
[0:57:58] <%Keyd00d> PODARGE
[0:58:00] <%skizzuto> podar-gay
[0:58:00] <%StaceMcGate> this dumb girl keeps aggroing the boss
[0:58:01] <%dekkitout> Cool
[0:58:03] <%joylent_blue> puh-dar-gay
[0:58:05] <Mendin> Look at that Devimon Myotismon Satan
[0:58:05] <joedatuous> is that a warframe?
[0:58:11] <Hellarussian> FAAANTASTIC
[0:58:21] <beetbo2> Pat will now fight Satan's warframe
[0:58:21] <PrimeNeverproc> poo-the-gay?
[0:58:26] <lemon_lore> satan looks hot
[0:58:27] <%joylent_blue> nice counterattack there
[0:58:31] <%Keyd00d> ATTACK GIRLFRIEND
[0:58:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Satan's a girl. Objective is to find the girlfriend. Hmmm
[0:58:37] <Tucker0603> use axe to protect here
[0:58:42] <%dekkitout> Man a Legion of this woulda been kickass
[0:58:49] <+BurkeBigsby> Iris that ho
[0:58:49] <beetbo2> Is that the girlfriend's legion?
[0:58:53] <%Keyd00d> wow that gap run
[0:58:58] <%wydamn> The girlfriend has a health bar, and the boss WILL attack her
[0:59:15] <%miguelrod777> shes one durable broad
[0:59:23] <+BurkeBigsby> Sync attacks wiff like crazy in this game
[0:59:26] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:59:27] <joedatuous> gams of steel
[0:59:29] <%Keyd00d> pat
[0:59:30] <Hellarussian> ope
[0:59:31] <%joylent_blue> send that shit flying
[0:59:32] <%Capta1n_H3nry> So our characters have the strength to aerial rave but not enough strength to jump or even vault over objects
[0:59:32] <+Darren716> LUL
[0:59:34] <Tucker0603> pat...
[0:59:41] <WRFWD> What was the plan Pat?
[0:59:43] <+Darren716> You have a gun...
[0:59:58] <beetbo2> who needs guns
[1:00:02] <beetbo2> when you have DOGGO
[1:00:10] <Tucker0603> why pat no use DT?
[1:00:10] <%Keyd00d> pat needs guns
[1:00:12] <%malacante> pat......
[1:00:18] <%joylent_blue> that was well thought out
[1:00:20] <%wydamn> @Capta1n_H3nry That's what happens when your elite super cops are unionized. They need their slave demons to do their jumping for them.
[1:00:21] <Hellarussian> lame it out
[1:00:23] <reonome> you have ARROW LEGION
[1:00:23] <%mayorrev> SCHUT
[1:00:23] <+BurkeBigsby> That's what arrow legion is for. Gun is poop
[1:00:24] <PrimeNeverproc> who needs guns when you can just jump into abyss
[1:00:24] <%Keyd00d> falling off cliffs is lamer
[1:00:26] <%devanmuse> you also have GUN STAND
[1:00:27] <%radda343> Did Pat just reject GUN
[1:00:28] <%miguelrod777> then die
[1:00:29] <%skizzuto> shooting is strong tho. especially with arrow and arm legion
[1:00:30] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat HATES guns
[1:00:34] <%Kain5707> just vineSchut
[1:00:36] <%mayorrev> Guess you'll die
[1:00:36] <%valriot> Shooting awesome wtf
[1:00:36] <%joylent_blue> ur lame pvpSass
[1:00:38] <MZess> but it's a COMBO gun
[1:00:39] <joedatuous> the gun looks like it doesn't feel great
[1:00:43] <%radda343> spinnyboi
[1:00:48] <%valriot> The gun animations are rad as fuck
[1:00:49] <DotDusk> GUN not good enough for Pat
[1:00:54] <%joylent_blue> action pose PogChamp
[1:00:54] <%Keyd00d> I seen it
[1:00:57] <+CharredChord> he speen
[1:01:22] <joedatuous> now fuck her pat
[1:01:25] <%joylent_blue> the gun feels fine, especially the combos with the Arrow legion
[1:01:27] <%miguelrod777> no mistakes
[1:01:28] <hassanico1> What was that enemy's name chat?
[1:01:29] <joedatuous> assert dominance
[1:01:31] <%wydamn> The best long range gun combo is the short press long press and sync attack, but it gets pretty repetitive.
[1:01:38] <WRFWD> Hidden boss should be in this area
[1:01:38] <%malacante> glad you got the 10000 point bonus for falling off a cliff three times
[1:01:41] <+OUTheTeam> pogane
[1:01:42] <%joylent_blue> hassanico1 Padarge

[1:01:58] <%joylent_blue> all i heard was puhDARgay
[1:02:01] <jubejube56> I want to unlock the final boss so badly but I cannot see a way for me to beat the mission where you fight every single boss unit in pairs
[1:02:08] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Who's the IRIS voice this time?

[1:19:42] <NeroIscariot12> It was not here for me.
[1:19:43] <doggieo> it'll look weird
[1:19:44] <ChaoticDaKiller> you'll definitely notice it if you're close to it
[1:19:44] <WRFWD> You can also see a distortion in the area around it
[1:19:45] <%malacante> yeah I triggered the posidon fight at the same time as it so it's this chapter
[1:19:49] <+Darren716> Man the word Iris has been ruined forever
[1:19:54] <+Darren716> Thanks Zero

[1:27:11] <mankeyfigh> ALLOFTHEMMMM
[1:27:12] <%PaleBloodInk> If you're playing as the FeMC, he tryies to flirt with you.

[1:27:15] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Wait, he confessed his love to me
[1:27:16] <%1matheuw> !uptime
[1:27:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 27m.

[1:27:27] <+BoboDaHobo> not just girl cool
[1:27:29] <+OUTheTeam> he hit on me as a dude
[1:27:29] <%ScreamLord> @chaumiester Specifically he's a horrifying Chuck E. Cheese style mascot that will haunt you around every corner of the Police Station
[1:27:30] <%decisivelynameless> He's hitting on male cop too
[1:27:31] <%gunzerkingdunce> If you play either
[1:27:32] <$iaraCatunda> weirdo
[1:27:34] <%StaceMcGate> If girl cop he says he gunning for you next
[1:27:34] <%skizzuto> he hit on me as boy cop
[1:27:34] <artificiallynatural> He hit on me as the dude
[1:27:35] <%PrinceOfEden> He hit on me as a dude
[1:27:39] <+ProtagonistJake> Wait in my playthrough he asked me out and I was playibng as a guy
[1:27:39] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Wait what? He hit on me when I was a dude!
[1:27:39] <ChaoticDaKiller> I swear to god I played guy cop and he hit on me too
[1:27:40] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat I played Male, and he hit on me after I told him to give olive flowers
[1:27:40] <vVAstrAVv> nah i played girl cop its the same lines
[1:27:44] <%1matheuw> i think ill finish the other VOD first guys
[1:27:45] <hassanico1> Maybe you have to make all the right choices
[1:27:47] <$iaraCatunda> yeyeyeye
[1:27:48] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat He hit on me and I was a guy sooooooo
[1:27:49] <TheAzureOracle> @AngriestPat If you play girl cop he hits on you and calls you his true love any time you speak with him
[1:27:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> Him coming straight to you might be a hint at his true love being your sister
[1:27:53] <+Darren716> I think youll like it
[1:27:55] <%Futurecity10> I gave olive flowers
[1:27:57] <+Darren716> 16
[1:28:00] <+Karasseram> Chat just discovered bi-sexuality is a thing.
[1:28:05] <jubejube56> I can confirm he does hit in you, idk if it is gender specific
[1:28:08] <+Darren716> You unlocked 16
[1:28:10] <%joylent_blue> ohhhh guess it has to do with his first quest outcome then
[1:28:13] <%BioApple> I also gave flowers as girl cop so maybe that is the trigger
[1:28:14] <hassanico1> @Karasseram to be fair it's more like this dude's just kinda slimy
[1:28:15] <+ProtagonistJake> Maybe he just didn't like Pat's cop
[1:28:16] <$iaraCatunda> 16
[1:28:23] <%flagi64> @angriestpat would you say that this game has the best story out of all the Platinum games to date?
[1:28:25] <+BoboDaHobo> @kar nah, the lines are just funny
[1:28:29] <TheAzureOracle> I didn't give flowers and he still hit on me as FemC
[1:28:35] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Maybe a slime?
[1:28:37] <hassanico1> Woolie Chie colors
[1:28:38] <+Darren716> Shit i thought you got Asuka now
[1:28:41] <%dekkitout> It looks like a cop car
[1:28:42] <%corinv> I think 12 is from one of the overall game completion orders
[1:28:43] <%wydamn> Ew, who wants a BROWN legion? The Zune of legions.
[1:28:49] <%corinv> Like finishing the game with a B rank total

[1:29:15] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I had a brown legion once, had to go to the doctor.
[1:29:16] <%BappoSama> @AngriestPat What was that?
[1:29:23] <$iaraCatunda> why don't you pick different colors for them?
[1:29:24] <+ProtagonistJake> Im guessing whether he hits on you depends on either key word collection or one of the answers you give him
[1:29:28] <Rada150> i like brown legion make them wooden puppets
[1:29:29] <%joylent_blue> it was a gift don't judge me
[1:29:31] <+BoboDaHobo> You heard it here first, Pat likes white more than brown

[1:29:54] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Legion Color Slot 12: Complete the game with rank S or higher on Pt Standard or higher (Rank: Platinum)
[1:29:56] <+Darren716> It was the Windows Phone of iPods

[1:30:12] <Tersalus> @1matheuw I'm guffawing, thank you
[1:30:21] <$iaraCatunda> not remembering the zune is not about being young it's about knowing which memories to throw in the garbage

[1:33:43] <%arancet> @AngriestPat can take a pic of this lobby
[1:33:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How could this place be evil? It looks so homely.
[1:33:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @dalmek trying to avoid janky chinese products. spent money on headphones and earbuds that didn't even last 4 months
[1:33:47] <Ajanimentorofheros> They can’t fit in anti air into their budget. Because research is IMPORTANT @angriestpat!
[1:33:55] <Rosy_Joan> i must have missed a cutscene, so Yoseph is bad guy but what did he do?
[1:33:56] <%gunzerkingdunce> The Evangelion level
[1:33:58] <%valriot> the penis
[1:34:07] <%michingmallecho> Time to rescue Aerith and take down shinra. AVALANCHE
[1:34:08] <%decisivelynameless> pregame dump
[1:34:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cause there was a toilet outside
[1:34:18] <%Ion_Laser> apatBig Piss
[1:34:21] <%gunzerkingdunce> @rosy_joan cloned your sibling
[1:34:21] <%joylent_blue> thats a.... shitty... place for a toilet
[1:34:21] <Tucker0603> wha't that shit dust coming off pat's character?
[1:34:23] <%RantingRavager> Good idea to void your bowels before a boss fight
[1:34:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> Gotta poop before the final fight
[1:34:25] <hassanico1> THE FINAL TOILET PAPER
[1:34:27] <WRFWD> How do you know how to use that paper? How do you know if you have any paper?
[1:34:29] <+Demopoot> @Rosy_Joan Shot at the protag after they pulled their devil trigger, cloned sibling
[1:34:31] <hassanico1> ...holy crap invisible toilet paper
[1:34:32] <@commanderclaw> Was that invisible toilet paper?
[1:34:32] <%dekkitout> Invisible toilet paper 🤔
[1:34:33] <%joylent_blue> Tucker0603 that means his DT is full
[1:34:33] <%miguelrod777> optic camo paper lol
[1:34:35] <Cranky_Construct> optical camo toilet paper huh
[1:34:36] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Always go before a bit mission!
[1:34:38] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Imagine shit-stained camo paper
[1:34:39] <%Laecerelius> Find all of the legendary shit tickets
[1:34:42] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Nothing worse than getting the shits mid boss fight
[1:34:42] <ActualNobody6400> does your sister eventually stop being such a bassive mithc?
[1:34:43] <%wydamn> I mean, you don't want to suddenly get the urge to poop when you're in phase 2 of the final boss
[1:34:47] <Rosy_Joan> @gunzerkingdunce is that all?
[1:34:49] <worldbrand> AWESOME
[1:34:51] <+BoboDaHobo> camo paper, makes it look like floating shit smears
[1:34:51] <ChaoticDaKiller> no sis it only LOOKS like I wiped my ass with my bare hand
[1:34:52] <worldbrand> I made it before big fight
[1:34:52] <$iaraCatunda> what do you mean invisibel toiler paper???
[1:34:56] <ChaoticDaKiller> it's actually optical camo tp
[1:35:01] <hassanico1> Yo this music though
[1:35:03] <%gunzerkingdunce> @rosy_joan you'll see how much here in a sec
[1:35:03] <$SvenHolgersson> yes fucko?
[1:35:04] <+twohitgood> if you're not in the HQ anymore does the toilet fairy follow you to the underground hideout?
[1:35:07] <%wydamn> @ChaoticDaKiller LUL
[1:35:08] <%michingmallecho> Snake, remember the basics of CQC and you will defeat the toilet
[1:35:09] <hassanico1> Give me somber tunes any day
[1:35:17] <$iaraCatunda> @chaoticdakiller LUL
[1:35:19] <ChamoCamouflage> that's some big ass elevator
[1:35:19] <Rosy_Joan> @gunzerkingdunce ok thanks for the catchup
[1:35:20] <KaliasTV> In this elevator we can ascend. We can become as gods.
[1:35:21] <%RantingRavager> what a suspiciously big elevator room
[1:35:21] <PunishedMercer_> big elevator
[1:35:24] <+Demopoot> @twohitgood Nope, gotta go to an earlier file
[1:35:25] <%ScreamLord> Look at this arena elevator
[1:35:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> Why is this elevator so massive
[1:35:27] <hassanico1> We're... just gonna take an elevator to the final boss?
[1:35:28] <%Laecerelius> Look at this battle elevator
[1:35:29] <Hellarussian> Armstrong is gonna be at the helipad with his nanomachines
[1:35:32] <%dekkitout> He's just doing a little instrumentality is all...
[1:35:32] <%skizzuto> @twohitgood not that I know of, but you can always go back to an earlier file
[1:35:34] <hassanico1> NOAH
[1:35:35] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Always go to the toilet before a big battle, that way, if you die, you won't shit yourself nearly as much.
[1:35:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Become as Gods
[1:35:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did he ever?
[1:35:43] <+Darren716> Time for a level full of Platinum's cornerstones
[1:35:44] <ActualNobody6400> Become as frogs?
[1:35:46] <%hntronium> A pervert would do this
[1:35:47] <%RantingRavager> Oh wait, shit that's super right
[1:35:47] <$iaraCatunda> wow I wonder if yosephs evil who coulda seen this coming
[1:35:48] <AwesomeDan_> maybe she died for reals
[1:35:50] <%flagi64> did the mc always have that shoulder particle effect?
[1:35:52] <%skizzuto> don't expect that shit to ever get explained
[1:35:53] <%RantingRavager> The real Akira could be dead and this is just a clone
[1:35:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh no, the elevator is over capacity, how could this be? Turn on infrared!
[1:35:57] <+Darren716> Like god damn they get all of them out this level
[1:36:00] <%valriot> Are you basically Police Boba Fett @angriestpat
[1:36:00] <+Demopoot> @skizzuto Nope, just when DT is charged
[1:36:02] <dadeaner> are you not a clone? you guys are twins right?
[1:36:05] <+twohitgood> queue up alice cooper's classic "clones" (or the smashing pumpkins cover)
[1:36:06] <%dekkitout> Too bad they didn't make mc and sibling twin brothers or sisters, cause then the clone thing would be even more fucked
[1:36:08] <hassanico1> @valriot our sister is
[1:36:13] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat so whats your opinion so far of how FF7R's combat looks from the TGS demo?
[1:36:15] <%ThatOneGameTester> The rea;l her is probably being used for tissue samples to grow more clones
[1:36:15] <worldbrand> Does it even matter when you're both clearly experiments to begin with?
[1:36:18] <%BappoSama> Hey, so is Hal played by Yuri?
[1:36:19] <%gunzerkingdunce> Oh it's highly likely that's not the real Akira
[1:36:21] <AwesomeDan_> and yet Hal can still pilon his drone.
[1:36:22] <WRFWD> But how can the drone still work?
[1:36:23] <hassanico1> That's some really good static
[1:36:25] <+Demopoot> Olive jammed, somehow Hal is fine rooThink
[1:36:29] <Rosy_Joan> that sounds like some sort of LOGIC VIRUS Kappa
[1:36:29] <+Darren716> Chest
[1:36:31] <worldbrand> chest
[1:36:32] <ChamoCamouflage> I mean, if Akira's a clone, would she be able to pull Devil Trigger? Yoseph _did_ intend to kill her before.
[1:36:32] <%shootbang_exe> how is Hal fine when the signal is jammed?
[1:36:33] <%skizzuto> I like to think real Akira is still in a coma from getting impaled by Jena
[1:36:34] <%BioApple> @BappoSama Kyle McCarley (9S)
[1:36:37] <%wydamn> Oh, hey Rei
[1:36:38] <%Maids4lyfe> why does it look like YoRHa?

[1:37:34] <LandOfTheWay> phrasing

[1:37:41] <%PaleBloodInk> Yep.
[1:37:43] <%joylent_blue> PrimeNeverproc yeah
[1:37:43] <%gunzerkingdunce> Akira most likely died when Jenna stabbed her
[1:37:44] <Hellarussian> he wants to make the Raiden clones
[1:37:44] <ChaoticDaKiller> how is the radio busted but hal'
[1:37:46] <%corinv> Yeah they're all male if you play as the girl

[1:37:57] <+Matto424> I mean it ain't his sister that's being cloned
[1:37:58] <Rosy_Joan> KIDS ARE CRUEL JACK

[1:38:02] <mankeyfigh> NOW FIGHTTTTTTTTT
[1:38:06] <%dalmek> @sphincter_spelunker fair. It's fine so far, and I got it in 2017 and use it fairly heavily. I'll just suggest the site Penonaudio, and you can do your homework from there, as you'd like
[1:38:09] <beetbo2> time to fight them all
[1:38:11] <hassanico1> WELP
[1:38:13] <%gunzerkingdunce> Hal's drone worked through dimensions, I think it can handle jams
[1:38:13] <mankeyfigh> LETS GOGOGOGOGOGOG
[1:38:14] <$iaraCatunda> EWWWW
[1:38:14] <ChaoticDaKiller> why can't hal talk to olive on the radio wherever he actually is

[1:38:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Begin, the clone war has.
[1:38:17] <+Demopoot> flop
[1:38:18] <%RantingRavager> Wait, do these akira clones have the same memories as the original?
[1:38:18] <%joylent_blue> this is some MGS4 shit
[1:38:19] <%ThatOneGameTester> Time for the orgy to commence!
[1:38:22] <worldbrand> oh they all get butt fabric wrinkles too?
[1:38:24] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat look at the evengelion
[1:38:24] <hassanico1> CLONE GANG FIGHT
[1:38:25] <%Futurecity10> Late term abortion time
[1:38:26] <%hntronium> TIME FOR AN ORGY
[1:38:26] <%BappoSama> So wait, Yoseph is now the evil science man?
[1:38:27] <Ajanimentorofheros> Yeah sister battle!
[1:38:28] <+Darren716> Time to control some crowds
[1:38:29] <%Typhaeon> The clones have inferior asses, they must be destoryed
[1:38:33] <hassanico1> @BappoSama he was all along
[1:38:33] <mankeyfigh> Can I get an F in chat boys?
[1:38:35] <LandOfTheWay> oh hey, it's the 2B Army vs 9S fight
[1:38:36] <+Valentttine> How are all these atrophied sisters gonna try kick your ass
[1:38:36] <%gunzerkingdunce> Look at the Not Plug Suits
[1:38:36] <%BappoSama> Man, I need to watch the VODs after this..
[1:38:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @dalmek Much appreciated, man. Thanks!
[1:38:43] <Ajanimentorofheros> Imagine they start just falling from the walls!
[1:38:43] <ActualNobody6400> I wonder if the ass is as prominent if it's the boy character
[1:38:43] <beetbo2> there can only be one imouto
[1:38:44] <%42nfl19> I'm late but did we ever get a confirmation on what happened to their dad?
[1:38:46] <+Darren716> Snap a pic
[1:38:48] <%michingmallecho> Where’s the spear of Longinus ??
[1:38:49] <Mendin> End of Evangeliautomata
[1:38:49] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 I mean, I knew that, but im confused when he came out about it.
[1:38:50] <hassanico1> @BappoSama he went big traitor last stream
[1:38:51] <%PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat TAKE A PICTURE YOU FUCK
[1:38:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F hellow2F
[1:38:56] <%wydamn> SUMO, HIS NAME IS SUMO
[1:38:56] <$iaraCatunda> do they not have personalities?
[1:39:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> PHOTO
[1:39:01] <%StaceMcGate> Unlimited Imouto Works
[1:39:01] <%Razputin217> Yorha has fallen
[1:39:03] <+Demopoot> existential crisis time
[1:39:05] <worldbrand> YOU'RE NOT ME!
[1:39:05] <%dekkitout> Calling it, next game you fight clone you
[1:39:06] <%malacante> YOURE NOT ME
[1:39:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> This is probably dealing some serious Sanity damage
[1:39:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wasn't something like this in a Stallone movie?
[1:39:09] <%joylent_blue> math is hard tho
[1:39:10] <Ajanimentorofheros> Heavy ordinance against sisters!
[1:39:11] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 OH FUCK
[1:39:12] <Rosy_Joan> me me me, me too
[1:39:16] <%gunzerkingdunce> There's more than just this room @angriestpat
[1:39:17] <dakkster> your not the real me!!
[1:39:18] <%RantingRavager> KILL YOUR SELVES
[1:39:18] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 How big we talkin?
[1:39:20] <+CharredChord> in the middle of a fight? I don't think so
[1:39:22] <%Ascethetic> photo
[1:39:22] <%ArcanumMBD> i can't believe Pat is committing mass fratricide
[1:39:24] <SlimeSlimeSlime> This tube, it was made for me...
[1:39:25] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You're just knocking them out LUL
[1:39:29] <$iaraCatunda> are the cloned empty in the head? how do we know Akira is the original?
[1:39:31] <ActualNobody6400> THen there's that one asymmetrical row that throws off the count, though
[1:39:33] <ChamoCamouflage> Yeah, seeing your clones would probably fuck you up. Some serious identity/existential dread right there.
[1:39:33] <%wydamn> Listen to this hype battle music appropriate for killing your sister to
[1:39:36] <hassanico1> @BappoSama We had a big fight with Jena and after beating her he had this new squad of Clones show up and shoot us down
[1:39:38] <%42nfl19> So what happened to Max Howard? did we get any confirmation on him? @AngriestPat
[1:39:38] <+lordsdb> nice end
[1:39:40] <Rosy_Joan> yeah Style murder the sister Pat
[1:39:41] <+Darren716> Wouldnt it be soroicide?
[1:39:44] <Ajanimentorofheros> Combo the sisters!
[1:39:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Twice :(
[1:39:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Is this NieR: Automata
[1:39:47] <VJdarkworld> that thing when they re-use the 9S and 2B dynamic for a brother and sister saintrMonkaS
[1:39:48] <%PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat You didn't take a picture of them MikeHogu
[1:39:53] <ChaoticDaKiller> Pat if you follow the fleeing scientists you're about to see you will encounter an optional fight
[1:39:53] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 Jena????
[1:39:54] <hassanico1> @BappoSama and then he disbanded Neuron and announced us a traitor to the whole ARK
[1:39:55] <+BarbellGoose> !uptime
[1:39:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 39m.
[1:39:56] <+Demopoot> No, but he ded
[1:40:01] <%ArcanumMBD> @Darren716 fratricide is brother or sister
[1:40:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> So many unarmed girls that you had to kill
[1:40:01] <%BioApple> @iaraCatunda none of the clones resist fighting you the way akira does (or talk) so they're probably not full hoo-man
[1:40:04] <%joylent_blue> he's probably fine 4Head
[1:40:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Mudering family is fratricide.
[1:40:09] <hassanico1> @BappoSama the other villain? Scientist lady?
[1:40:10] <ActualNobody6400> he's fuckin' in there
[1:40:12] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 no more please..
[1:40:13] <+lordsdb> Max might come back in the next one
[1:40:13] <%Keyd00d> Lotta people skipping streams
[1:40:15] <%Maids4lyfe> I bet Max was turned into a Chimera
[1:40:18] <%corinv> Hey pat when you get up the stairs and the door opens here run back down to this room
[1:40:18] <%gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat make the right choice at the end to know what happened to Max
[1:40:19] <%BappoSama> @hassanico1 I can't take it. xD
[1:40:22] <%Divryne> YEEE CREEP ON YOUR SIS.
[1:40:22] <%PrinceOfEden> There we go
[1:40:23] <%Capta1n_H3nry> I mean he's probably a Chimera or something at this point
[1:40:24] <%RantingRavager> Take pictures of your unconscious sisters
[1:40:25] <%PrinceOfEden> My ocd is at ease
[1:40:28] <%42nfl19> BECOME AS LAPPY
[1:40:29] <BioKnight99> "knocked out"
[1:40:29] <%wydamn> "Merely pretending to be unconscious"
[1:40:29] <PrimeNeverproc> did we get jennas motivation?
[1:40:34] <mankeyfigh> MAYBE IN THE SEQUEL? NotLikeThis
[1:40:36] <vVAstrAVv> i feel like max is alive since he did reattach the legatus to axe legion
[1:40:40] <%dekkitout> This is gonna be quite the plot thread to resolve
[1:40:41] <%malacante> Jenna's motivation was fuck Yoseph
[1:40:43] <worldbrand> i know it's Maximilian, but i want to believe his name is Maximum Howard
[1:40:44] <%Laecerelius> She was trying to stop Yosef from being a huge creepo?
[1:40:46] <%gunzerkingdunce> There's 2 different outcomes at the end depending on your choice
[1:40:47] <$iaraCatunda> @bioapple oh ok that not as dark as I thought :/
[1:40:49] <%MassConnect> they're some kind of knocked
[1:40:49] <jubejube56> After all no humans can die in the Nintendo game
[1:40:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> Mamoru them all
[1:40:51] <UnfilteredComic> There is an "implication' on Max's fate later
[1:40:54] <+BoboDaHobo> why was there first instinct upon waking up to kill you?
[1:40:55] <+lordsdb> Oh you missed a chest before this boss battle room
[1:40:59] <+BoboDaHobo> their*
[1:41:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BappoSama Don't worry, Jena's dead. She went on and on about us being puppets but never said what she was actually trying to do. Biggest "Just Talk" moment
[1:41:02] <Charlie_Decker> kinda did get Jenna's motivation, least i thought it was fairly clear
[1:41:02] <ChaoticDaKiller> These scientists will lead you to an optional fight Pat don't miss out
[1:41:03] <beetbo2> even the vending machines had her soul stolen
[1:41:03] <LandOfTheWay> @PrimeNeverproc more or less. her plan was to stop yoseph by doing all her terrorist shit
[1:41:04] <worldbrand> if it's later why are you saying it bruh
[1:41:05] <a_mad_dragon> fishy water? DansGame
[1:41:08] <gekizenbu> its a good idea to stock up on items here especially
[1:41:09] <$iaraCatunda> did Jena die?
[1:41:12] <WRFWD> Before you enter the next room, at the end of the stairs, turn back and go back to the clone room, there's a red case
[1:41:15] <+CharredChord> Rated T for Mental anguish
[1:41:16] <ChamoCamouflage> Jena's dead.
[1:41:16] <+ProtagonistJake> you have to read her character entry in the files to see her motivation. You have to do that for a lot of the game's plot anyway
[1:41:17] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat Jena's MOTIVATION WAS stopping YOSEPH FROM DOING THIS SHIT
[1:41:18] <%Laecerelius> Jena is super dead
[1:41:18] <%PrinceOfEden> Same Pat, same.
[1:41:24] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Would've rather had Tsundere Vendor send me off for big battle.
[1:41:24] <vVAstrAVv> why would we get jennas motivation. that requires just talk
[1:41:25] <%ArcanumMBD> I cant believe Pat isn't getting 100% on the first run through
[1:41:26] <PrimeNeverproc> but why destroy the world to stop yo?
[1:41:28] <%RantingRavager> Rated T for Too Many Sisters
[1:41:28] <%dekkitout> I mean- she disintegrated, but so did the mc
[1:41:31] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Jena SUPER fuckin dead
[1:41:31] <+Demopoot> Jena wanted the harem for herself
[1:41:34] <doggieo> Follow EVIL Scientists
[1:41:36] <ActualNobody6400> on your own time? or on your bone time?
[1:41:36] <+CharredChord> There's a secret verse back down the stairs @AngriestPat
[1:41:37] <Cranky_Construct> Jena was also really big on being a human purist
[1:41:37] <ChamoCamouflage> Both Jena and Yoseph probably got some serious messianic complex, hence why they barely explain shit all to you.
[1:41:46] <Cranky_Construct> Turning into a monster at the end was the last thing she wanted
[1:41:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Jesus. Learn how to run science guy.
[1:41:51] <$iaraCatunda> iris
[1:41:54] <worldbrand> Huh

[1:42:26] <PrimeNeverproc> agamemnon? lol
[1:42:28] <+Taglog7> Digimon?1
[1:42:28] <%SGrim> So they're just going older mythologies? Got it.
[1:42:36] <%decisivelynameless> The music for this stage is so good
[1:42:41] <Tersalus> Agamemnon! what a guy
[1:42:41] <%malacante> it's all greek isn't it?
[1:42:41] <%joylent_blue> i fought him in File 12 but not here monkaS
[1:42:42] <%Zombrocom> Nah every single name has been Greek
[1:42:43] <hassanico1> @SGrim every enemy is Greek myth names
[1:42:43] <ChamoCamouflage> Nah, they're going for Greek Myth in specific @SGrim
[1:42:52] <a_mad_dragon> the only one of those guys who WASN'T a dick was odysseus
[1:42:56] <+lordsdb> @Taglog7 Yes Yes Yea!
[1:42:58] <VJdarkworld> 0_0
[1:43:02] <hassanico1> Iris for HP?
[1:43:03] <ChamoCamouflage> I mean, that's arguable @a_mad_dragon
[1:43:11] <%gunzerkingdunce> Slay all
[1:43:13] <+Taglog7> DIGITAL CHAMPIONS
[1:43:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Spirit Bomb!? :O
[1:43:19] <%dekkitout> This guy's a bamf
[1:43:19] <ChamoCamouflage> Almost everyone in that war was fucking dicks
[1:43:19] <$iaraCatunda> damn chain drive sucks ass
[1:43:24] <ChamoCamouflage> With some exceptions
[1:43:39] <AwesomeDan_> all the jelly enemies are named after gods.
[1:43:42] <worldbrand> thanks crazy talk
[1:43:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @a_mad_dragon Didn't Odysseus just bang chicks on an island while his wife back home eventually killed herself waiting for him?
[1:43:48] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Wow
[1:43:51] <+Karasseram> all the enemy names are from myths and also names of celestial objects
[1:43:51] <%joylent_blue> damn
[1:43:53] <UnfilteredComic> Get used to seeing him in file 12
[1:43:53] <%hntronium> S+ like a boss
[1:43:54] <lemon_lore> S+
[1:43:56] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Crazy Talk saves the day!
[1:43:58] <ChaoticDaKiller> chain drive is more of a crowd handler
[1:43:59] <%mister___doctor> Wow Pat nice S+
[1:44:03] <+BoboDaHobo> that's twice now where they die directly after you call them tough
[1:44:04] <%Capta1n_H3nry> That's the first time I've seen Crazy Talk work to your advantage
[1:44:06] <$iaraCatunda> pat always ends battle by saying bitch or fucker depending on the difficultu
[1:44:08] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That was the fastest use of Crazy Talk yet
[1:44:09] <%wydamn> Dis good music
[1:44:09] <hassanico1> @Sphincter_Spelunker no way, he eventually did manage to get back home and save her from a bunch of suitors
[1:44:13] <ChamoCamouflage> @Sphincter_Spelunker I thinkg you're right on the first one, but wrong on the last one. It was his dog that died.
[1:44:24] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah his dog died
[1:44:24] <%PrinceOfEden> You think so Hal?
[1:44:26] <%MasterDecoder> @Capta1n_H3nry I think htere have been one or two other times
[1:44:27] <%PrinceOfEden> WHat gave it away?!
[1:44:28] <a_mad_dragon> @Sphincter_Spelunker no, he came back to his wife and killed all the assholes that were harrassing her day and night
[1:44:30] <ChamoCamouflage> Penelope was alive.
[1:44:31] <hassanico1> @ChamoCamouflage his dog died from sadness seeing him for the first time after 10 years
[1:44:34] <%dekkitout> @hassanico1 After- his brief fling on whore island
[1:44:36] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The clones didn't tip you off, Hal?
[1:44:39] <%corinv> Man FUCK getting all the photos of these researchers
[1:44:44] <%corinv> There's a few I still haven't found
[1:45:03] <%gunzerkingdunce> @sphincter_spelunker nah man, he banged a witch cuz she was so thirsty she wouldn't let him leave. Then he goes home to stop any NTR from happening by murdering all the scumbags in his house that tried to bang his wife.
[1:45:06] <hassanico1> @dekkitout I know about Circe and the Logos Eaters but I don't remember this whore island
[1:45:12] <ChaoticDaKiller> R3-3 for researchers bruh
[1:45:20] <ChamoCamouflage> Achilles brooded in his tent because of Agamnenon, and got his bestie killed.
[1:45:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Maybe I thinking of a movie. I know I saw someone walk into the ocean from some Odyssey thing
[1:45:26] <%ArcanumMBD> Y'know, i find Axe's perfect call to be the weakest one despite how cool it looks
[1:45:27] <%corinv> I went to R3-3 but think I'm still missing a couple
[1:45:32] <ChamoCamouflage> Then he dragged Hector's corpse on a chariot in front of his dad.
[1:45:37] <%wydamn> C for Chry It Again
[1:45:42] <%dekkitout> @Sphincter_Spelunker That was Anticlia or whatever her name was
[1:45:50] <mankeyfigh> MOAR
[1:45:53] <$iaraCatunda> ye
[1:45:56] <%RantingRavager> Good Question
[1:45:57] <%PrinceOfEden> I am all, I am all of me.
[1:45:57] <%mister___doctor> "wow that was actually really impressive" >C rank
[1:45:57] <Hellarussian> probs
[1:45:57] <hassanico1> I AM ALL THAT I AM
[1:45:57] <%BioApple> was odysseus the guy who tied himself to a mast because he wanted to see what the siren song was all about
[1:45:59] <+mcjimbo12> it seems very likely
[1:46:00] <%miguelrod777> maybe
[1:46:01] <+Demopoot> existential crisis gang
[1:46:03] <DeoxysPrime> Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:46:03] <hassanico1> CRAWLING IN MY SKIN
[1:46:05] <$iaraCatunda> No because they don't talk
[1:46:06] <%dekkitout> Holy shit- even Gendo would be amazed by this many clones
[1:46:07] <AwesomeDan_> intense af music
[1:46:09] <%gunzerkingdunce> @bioapple yes
[1:46:12] <a_mad_dragon> if she is, then what the fuck is the brother
[1:46:12] <UnfilteredComic> Cat nearby
[1:46:17] <+Matto424> nice
[1:46:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Evangelion
[1:46:20] <VJdarkworld> "........ rei" - Gendo
[1:46:23] <phoenix7240> some one already answered bioapple damn
[1:46:26] <%ThatOneGameTester> Just check for the dots under your eyelid Akira 4Head
[1:46:26] <$iaraCatunda> no because only she has a personality
[1:46:27] <%ArcanumMBD> haha pat's actually going the right way
[1:46:27] <%skizzuto> I love how somber/melancholic this music is, rather than hype like you'd expect
[1:46:30] <+Kitafin> existential crisis
[1:46:31] <+mcjimbo12> like if you get into this situation wouldn't the original immediately, i dunno, dye their hair? maybe get a tattoo?
[1:46:31] <SlimeSlimeSlime> This is actual progress.
[1:46:32] <%velemi> I can't believe Ryouko Matoi is Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:46:35] <%mister___doctor> Does this mean that the ARI has ass for days
[1:46:35] <hassanico1> @a_mad_dragon brother never got incapitated and captured by Yoseph for "treatment"
[1:46:36] <+Darren716> >actually progressing
[1:46:39] <%joylent_blue> i did the same thing
[1:46:39] <%RantingRavager> Wait, fi they're all her, then they could all theoretically be sacrificed at the altar of some legion and all get devil triggers?
[1:46:40] <Cranky_Construct> this is core progress yeah
[1:46:40] <%ArcanumMBD> This is progress
[1:46:42] <WRFWD> That's the right way
[1:46:42] <%Keyd00d> yes
[1:46:45] <$iaraCatunda> she's not one of them because the other are "empty"
[1:46:46] <+Darren716> Right way
[1:46:46] <UnfilteredComic> I did the same thing
[1:46:46] <+BoboDaHobo> that was progress
[1:46:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Right way
[1:46:47] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat this way is progress, go follow akira
[1:46:48] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat again, I see no downside. If she's the chimera clone, then there's enough genetic drift to breed her. I see this as an absolute win! PogChamp\
[1:46:52] <doggieo> PROGRESS
[1:46:53] <SlimeSlimeSlime> This is the right way!
[1:46:55] <%SGrim> PogChamp FUCK
[1:46:58] <+Darren716> This is the progress
[1:46:58] <%Capta1n_H3nry> You're going the right way
[1:47:00] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Is that 9S?
[1:47:01] <+Karasseram> thius is the right path
[1:47:02] <%PrinceOfEden> THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY
[1:47:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> If you follow her, you get blocked off
[1:47:09] <%joylent_blue> Sir_Gawain_Lotsson yeah same VA
[1:47:12] <%mister___doctor> Follow your heart, Pat, God.
[1:47:17] <VJdarkworld> @SGrim saintrMonkaS saintrMonkaS saintrMonkaS
[1:47:18] <$iaraCatunda> @sir_gawain_lotsson yes
[1:47:21] <Hellarussian> ok LUL
[1:47:24] <ActualNobody6400> red matter
[1:47:27] <ActualNobody6400> pat
[1:47:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> heh
[1:47:29] <%PrinceOfEden> LUL
[1:47:29] <%joylent_blue> it was linear all along 4Head
[1:47:30] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah
[1:47:32] <UnfilteredComic> Oh videogames
[1:47:32] <%RantingRavager> LUL
[1:47:37] <rosemon5001> what is this clone wars esce birthing station
[1:47:37] <%wydamn> Oh no, just as you were about to follow her.
[1:47:39] <%Ion_Laser> :D
[1:47:43] <ActualNobody6400> thank you
[1:47:45] <%ArcanumMBD> You thought you had path choice, but it was me! Linear progress!
[1:47:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I feel like that should have been cinematic
[1:47:49] <%corinv> Impeccable aim
[1:47:51] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat Purple stuff means Homunculus nonsense right?
[1:47:58] <ne0bunny> I did the exact same thing
[1:48:12] <%wydamn> It's a good thing these defenseless women are so easy to kill.
[1:48:14] <%RantingRavager> Crowd Control your Sisters
[1:48:24] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Yes, beat the shit out of your onee-chans Patrick
[1:48:25] <%Keyd00d> @wydamn monkaS
[1:48:25] <hassanico1> Why are a bunch of recently released unarmed clones doing so much damage?!
[1:48:27] <%joylent_blue> yeah do launchers on your sister's clones
[1:48:37] <%Shadicara> !uptime
[1:48:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 48m.
[1:48:43] <UnfilteredComic> This whole File is just like Nier Automata Endings D and E, so many parallels
[1:48:51] <AwesomeDan_> whats the point of killing your sisters clones if you can't look cool doing it
[1:48:51] <rosemon5001> yeees slaugther them for being clones
[1:48:53] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What do they expect these mostly naked, mindless drones to do to you anyway? They don't even have weapons
[1:48:53] <%RantingRavager> Wait, are clones of your sister still your sister?
[1:48:55] <%arancet> beating your sister like you always wanted
[1:48:56] <+Valentttine> I dunno was it mentioned but the enemy ragdoll physics are actually really good when they get knocked around
[1:49:04] <%Shadicara> Early stream PogChamp
[1:49:14] <Dragovus> If your sister is a clone then why is she the only one with memories from the original?
[1:49:15] <%dekkitout> Another clone trope that comes to mind; the one where all the clones die, save a child version clone
[1:49:18] <%malacante> oh boy time for a part I didn't fail eight times
[1:49:19] <+Karasseram> good old put fainted symbols on the corpses so our age rating doesn't go too high
[1:49:19] <PrimeNeverproc> streight to the moon, pat, streight to the moon
[1:49:19] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That one scientist got huge.
[1:49:20] <%ArcanumMBD> Anyone else find it weird that everything is purple shifting with the lines coming off geometry? Instead of redshifting like normal
[1:49:22] <hassanico1> Black Hole bombs are so cool
[1:49:29] <ActualNobody6400> pat's fist is the number one sleep aide among physicians
[1:49:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway500 bonus50 Finding out if you're a clone seems like one of those Sanity-damaging things you should just ignore. It's like when you find anything weird in Call of Cthulhu. Just be anti-curious and look away from everything, for your own mental safety.
[1:49:37] <tearsaurther> @angriestpat wouldn't the twin that's not clone be ab
[1:50:04] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Time for a meh boss fight
[1:50:08] <%wydamn> @ArcanumMBD Yoseph has embraced to the power of purple

[1:50:16] <%ThatOneGameTester> cold boi
[1:50:17] <%joylent_blue> he cool
[1:50:17] <tearsaurther> @angriestpat wouldn't the the twin that's not a clone tell her she's real. like tifa did for cloud?
[1:50:18] <hassanico1> @GeneralSCPatton remember when Sephiroth found out he wasn't normal? Instant 100% sanity damage
[1:50:19] <%hntronium> cool
[1:50:20] <ActualNobody6400> what

[1:50:27] <%Zombrocom> Arke
[1:50:29] <%42nfl19> CHERNO ALPHA
[1:50:29] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Mr. Freeze
[1:50:30] <%ScreamLord> Arke?
[1:50:32] <ScatterCatt> Okay 9S thanks for the advice.
[1:50:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What was the name? I heard Iris
[1:50:41] <%corinv> I feel like they fucked up the sound clip that plays there because that's super not how that's pronounced
[1:50:43] <UnfilteredComic> idk why it says iris there
[1:50:49] <%ScreamLord> I was expecting Boreas
[1:50:53] <%Sokumotanaka> Is it your legion's upgrade form?
[1:50:55] <artificiallynatural> Arke is what it looked like
[1:50:55] <%Zombrocom> Arke is the twin sister of Iris
[1:50:56] <hassanico1> @UnfilteredComic Arke is the sistter of Iris in Greek Myth
[1:51:04] <%dekkitout> I guess its the newer model Mass Produced Arm Legion..
[1:51:10] <$TheCrispyBoi> thar arm boi is cooler than our arm boi
[1:51:11] <%RantingRavager> Lul Cirno
[1:51:12] <%ArcanumMBD> if only Pat had a gun then he could hit this enemy
[1:51:15] <%joylent_blue> that was a good combo there
[1:51:23] <%valriot> Man, if only you had some form of RANGED WEAPON
[1:51:28] <UnfilteredComic> @hassanico1 Oh really? interesting, i forget which enemy is Iris in this game
[1:51:30] <+BoboDaHobo> gun is lame though
[1:51:32] <%malacante> lol I wonder if this was intially named iris and then they went "oh wait shit that's our computer thing"
[1:51:37] <AwesomeDan_> hes close enough to not need a ranged weapon.
[1:51:38] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat IM Pretty sure she's not a clone, since EVERY CLONE WEVE SEEN has shown any capabilities of speech, and take all of YOSEPH'S ORDERS
[1:51:40] <%RantingRavager> A for Adequate
[1:51:41] <%nmaten> Nice A loser
[1:51:41] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nice!
[1:51:45] <%joylent_blue> you guys keep talking about gun but he just gladius combo'd the shit outta that thing
[1:52:00] <+Darren716> Time to sonic
[1:52:03] <tearsaurther> am I a clone! ?
[1:52:10] <%arancet> shell be a clone only and precisely when they decide shes a clone
[1:52:11] <doggieo> Cloned in the womb
[1:52:12] <+Darren716> Wait shit not yet
[1:52:20] <UnfilteredComic> Nah its just doom shit i think
[1:52:22] <mankeyfigh> WAT?
[1:52:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> For selling new Android models
[1:52:22] <PrimeNeverproc> become as clones
[1:52:27] <%miguelrod777> we did an oopsie
[1:52:30] <%hntronium> Hey Pat, how's the sword's zandatsu thing in combat? Still pretty bad?
[1:52:33] <%RantingRavager> use ALL THE MECHANICS
[1:52:35] <%Keyd00d> destroy 99 percent of the world as a joke
[1:52:37] <%arancet> theyre making you cycle for the final assault
[1:52:37] <BYAKURENLOVER763> thanks dad legion
[1:52:39] <%StaceMcGate> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[1:52:39] <ActualNobody6400> The Ark is a test facility
[1:52:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> What, they just used science to invent Cube Hell?
[1:52:43] <mankeyfigh> USE ALL YOUR LEGIONS, LET THEM GUIDE YOU
[1:52:52] <BioKnight99> what does an axe help against smoke?
[1:52:53] <Tonicky > You the best Axe Legion
[1:52:55] <hassanico1> @UnfilteredComic I think it's just an error on their part, it's unlikely the named an Iris with the IRIS mechanic around
[1:52:56] <ChamoCamouflage> Didn't Jena explain that the Corruption thing was basically a big "returning to where we were"/"afterlife" kinda thing?
[1:52:56] <%BioApple> i hope the shield goes away when you leave menu
[1:52:56] <worldbrand> If its range was, like, chain range, that would be dope
[1:53:03] <%ThatOneGameTester> Time for the victory lap that makes you use every single ability you gained until now right?
[1:53:05] <%PrinceOfEden> This next part took me an embarrassing amount of attempts.
[1:53:06] <%wydamn> The sword thing is good, I just keep forgetting to use R3 to slow down time when I use it
[1:53:07] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Is that really an axe? It looks more like a greatsword with a bump
[1:53:10] <UnfilteredComic> Here we go this hallway
[1:53:11] <%ArcanumMBD> TIME TO RUN
[1:53:11] <WRFWD> gotta go fast
[1:53:14] <%joylent_blue> BioKnight99 its the magic barrier around it that helps
[1:53:15] <%wydamn> RUN MOTHAFUCKAH
[1:53:15] <doggieo> HATED this part
[1:53:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Jena didn't explain shit
[1:53:17] <%mister___doctor> "HEY IDIOT, USE THE AXE LEGION"
[1:53:17] <+Darren716> Rolling around at the speed of sound
[1:53:20] <hassanico1> @ThatOneGameTester final exam dungeon

[1:53:32] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Weird since they got Zandatsu pretty good in Revengence
[1:53:32] <Tersalus> Okami?
[1:53:32] <beetbo2> a sonic level but better
[1:53:33] <Blank9> sword mode is actually good if you perfect dodge with it
[1:53:36] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Gotta follow my rainbow~
[1:53:36] <KaliasTV> Crash bandicoot time
[1:53:36] <beetbo2> hopefully
[1:53:36] <%Wallabri> rollin around at the speed of hound!!
[1:53:37] <%dekkitout> Has Platinum made a Sonic game?
[1:53:37] <AwesomeDan_> infinite ass hallway
[1:53:38] <%Ion_Laser> LIVIN IN THE CITY
[1:53:38] <%king_wragles> "think fast, but I'll tell you the answer any way"
[1:53:38] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I mean I guess why they couldn't call it the greatsword legion, but it's not really an axe
[1:53:38] <Blank9> it has a unique attack then
[1:53:45] <$arcielardor> CRUISIN AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[1:53:45] <Dragovus> Gotta go fast!
[1:53:46] <artificiallynatural> I kept fucking this part up by dodging
[1:53:47] <worldbrand> this took me a few tries, i was awful at it
[1:53:50] <Asuxley> or crah bandicoot
[1:53:51] <%42nfl19> wait I blinked, is Akira ahead of pat?
[1:53:51] <agumon9000> YOU MISSED SOME
[1:53:53] <%ThatOneGameTester> @hassanico1 that is also a fair analogy
[1:53:54] <hassanico1> It's Raiden through the exploding building
[1:53:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> One that works?
[1:54:01] <%PrinceOfEden> @artificiallynatural Same, it was instinct. Yet it killed me every time.
[1:54:01] <+Javaa01> Nah, this is that one idea from the Korra game they did
[1:54:03] <%joylent_blue> trailer shot PogChamp
[1:54:03] <%42nfl19> USE ALL THE LEGIONS
[1:54:05] <%Shadicara> Is this the final chapter? This is a very final looking chapter
[1:54:06] <%malacante> it's the kind of security system with walls, hal
[1:54:07] <%miguelrod777> cool
[1:54:08] <+Darren716> THE LEGION LIKE YOU
[1:54:10] <%Keyd00d> for some reason I thought arm was going to sacrifice itself there
[1:54:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @Shadicara yep
[1:54:15] <%Keyd00d> but that wouldn't make sense
[1:54:16] <ActualNobody6400> Hal, shut up and let me figure out myself please, thanks
[1:54:21] <%joylent_blue> Keyd00d LUL
[1:54:21] <%wydamn> "Now I'm safe from that magic shit that can go through walls"
[1:54:22] <tearsaurther> I like they tell which one to use instead of just, you kmow, letting you figure it out
[1:54:23] <SlimeSlimeSlime> S+
[1:54:24] <+Darren716> It made sure you didnt die for once
[1:54:24] <WRFWD> This is the intro room
[1:54:26] <%PrinceOfEden> @Javaa01 I forgot Platinum made a Korra game until you just reminded me.
[1:54:27] <%RantingRavager> THE STAAART OF THE GAME
[1:54:27] <%tragicjohnson84> That part was frickin hard for me
[1:54:29] <beetbo2> more clone?
[1:54:30] <tearsaurther> Fuck critical thinkimg
[1:54:30] <%arancet> this is the room from the opening cutscene
[1:54:30] <VJdarkworld> GLORY to MANKIND
[1:54:30] <hassanico1> I think the Legions don't actually resent us at this point anymore
[1:54:31] <SlimeSlimeSlime> MORE CLONES!
[1:54:31] <%wydamn> Oh hey, first cutscene of the game
[1:54:32] <%ThatOneGameTester> Time to gain the final legion, the Onee-San legion
[1:54:32] <gekizenbu> MULTI VERGIL COMBAT
[1:54:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Where it all started. Like poetry
[1:54:35] <%hntronium> Time to fuck some clones
[1:54:35] <%Keyd00d> Ladies
[1:54:37] <%dekkitout> The harem is here
[1:54:37] <hassanico1> RAVENS
[1:54:38] <%RantingRavager> YorHA
[1:54:39] <%ArcanumMBD> this fight kicked my ass
[1:54:45] <closetgremlin12> Time for the sister battle
[1:54:45] <%Shadicara> KILL YORHA
[1:54:45] <%Ion_Laser> apatCaw apatCaw
[1:54:46] <ActualNobody6400> oh fuck off
[1:54:46] <%valriot> This is some YoRHa shit
[1:54:46] <%ArcanumMBD> because of the gunners
[1:54:51] <%gunzerkingdunce> All the clones are made with Legion cores it seems
[1:54:53] <Dragovus> How many clones of my sister do you need, old man?
[1:54:54] <UnfilteredComic> Use balck hole, mess em up
[1:55:00] <worldbrand> this one can be a bitch without super armor
[1:55:02] <hassanico1> Get the gun one first!
[1:55:02] <%joylent_blue> this fight is an ass kicker purely because of their fucking GUNS
[1:55:02] <%Ascethetic> DT these fuckers
[1:55:06] <SlimeSlimeSlime> YorHa, Beta version.
[1:55:06] <$arcielardor> You gonna use your super beast power?
[1:55:07] <VJdarkworld> YORHA COP
[1:55:08] <%korth367> look at them shooting you
[1:55:10] <%dekkitout> Maximum Pupper
[1:55:11] <%korth367> with their guns
[1:55:13] <%hntronium> @gunzerkingdunce Not all, those ones that got out of pods earlier had no legions
[1:55:18] <%korth367> if only you also had gun
[1:55:19] <jubejube56> This has got to be one of the more annoying fights in the game
[1:55:26] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat Gun RAVEN seems as annoying as Yakuza gun enemies
[1:55:31] <%arancet> @AngriestPat dont forget your dt
[1:55:40] <gekizenbu> DT is a valuable consumable tho
[1:55:41] <KaliasTV> They made DT a victim of Too Good To Use LUL
[1:55:42] <worldbrand> he's doin good tho
[1:55:44] <Kongro_> Pat, you should really be using some Super Armor ability cores
[1:55:45] <amiroodude> is it time for the DT
[1:55:47] <%hntronium> He probably savin dt for boss
[1:55:49] <agumon9000> Don't use the DT until the final phase of the boss
[1:55:51] <AwesomeDan_> seems to be fine without DT
[1:55:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no, forget your DT. what if he needs it later
[1:55:53] <%ScreamLord> They're not even using their Legions
[1:55:55] <agumon9000> DT take fucking forever to use
[1:55:56] <%gunzerkingdunce> @hntronium no no, I mean they technically ARE legions. The machine that makes them have the same tubes as the ones that contain clones
[1:55:58] <jubejube56> DT also takes stupid long to build
[1:56:00] <artificiallynatural> DT is so hard to build up
[1:56:04] <%malacante> it also charges soooo slooow. Ive never gotten 2 in a chapter
[1:56:07] <$arcielardor> Don't use DT until post-game
[1:56:07] <%RantingRavager> Pew pew pew
[1:56:09] <%Shadicara> So when do they all combine into one big clone?
[1:56:21] <%arancet> DT hard to build up if you use whole bar, but you can pop it briefly
[1:56:21] <%gunzerkingdunce> @shadicara shhhhh
[1:56:25] <worldbrand> like a clone megazord?
[1:56:25] <hassanico1> @Shadicara when Gendo decides to use Adam obviously
[1:56:26] <%wydamn> "I'm just going to sit back here and take potshots at the player and there's NOTHING he can do about it"
[1:56:27] <%BioApple> DT is for using like a third of your bar to get your health back when you're out of heals
[1:56:39] <PrimeNeverproc> rip their hearts out
[1:56:46] <ChaoticDaKiller> Another optional fight if you come back to this room after opening the elevator Pat
[1:56:46] <%joylent_blue> sick
[1:56:48] <+mcjimbo12> Arm Legion has some nutty utility with that black hole
[1:56:54] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I just realized I'm attentively watching the stream instead of watching/playing something else. That's when you know you're getting some good entertainment.
[1:57:03] <%wydamn> So, this is the room from the first cutscene
[1:57:06] <%wydamn> er, was
[1:57:09] <+Demopoot> Hidden dig here

[2:06:39] <Tucker0603> As someone who has a legit problem with my genital veins this conversation is invoking the WORST feeling in me.
[2:06:42] <%wydamn> Shinji is fighting the final Angel, and Asuka can't stop talking about injecting people's balls.
[2:06:47] <+Karasseram> go to your porn site of choice and search of saline injection if you waqnt to know more guys lol
[2:06:47] <%dekkitout> ^

[2:07:02] <%Shadicara> Real life judgement nut
[2:07:04] <+mcjimbo12> Tucker0603 my genital veins are fine and honestly it's not sounding much better over here
[2:07:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yoseph needs to experiment with ball inflation and become as gods
[2:07:12] <%king_wragles> That's not even inaccurate
[2:07:14] <hassanico1> Asuka's balls...
[2:07:18] <%dekkitout> "Thermal expansion"
[2:07:19] <+BoboDaHobo> get Dick to watch the stream
[2:07:19] <beetbo2> YOSEPH needs the SALINE
[2:07:21] <ActualNobody6400> the hitbox on that last hit of the ora ora combo is fucking whack
[2:07:21] <%kyh9> Asuka talked about Shinji fucking his mom
[2:07:24] <%miguelrod777> wtf
[2:07:24] <Mendin> Well yeah, Paige is basically asuka
[2:07:25] <beetbo2> to SAVE the WORLD
[2:07:28] <+Karasseram> could be worse. Paige could be like I'm going to a fisting party
[2:07:29] <%dekkitout> God I loved Magma Diver episode LUL
[2:07:30] <Kongro_> One of the least worst things to do with your balls to be fair.

[2:07:33] <@BigNaturalMan59> PAIGE WATCH EVA
[2:07:33] <+twohitgood> hey paige, read Crooked Little Vein if you haven't already. It's by Warren Ellis. It has the saline injection and also godzilla bukake and a conspiracy about the US constitution.
[2:07:34] <%arancet> @AngriestPat can take a pic of this area
[2:07:34] <%gunzerkingdunce> Asuka and Rei touch balls in that one doujin series
[2:07:36] <+Darren716> Here
[2:07:36] <%hntronium> Too much information
[2:07:37] <hassanico1> Asuka's dick inflation huh...
[2:07:37] <+darquezsmith> LUL
[2:07:37] <%Shadicara> Become as balls pat
[2:07:39] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Asuka would be the one doing the injecting.
[2:07:40] <%velemi> YEAH YEAH YEAH HYPER
[2:07:40] <doggieo> EXPLORE FIRST before you go to her
[2:07:41] <ChaoticDaKiller> missable items if you talk to akira imediately
[2:07:44] <TheAzureOracle> Asuka is basically the progenitor of inflation fetish so
[2:07:44] <Mendin> Inflate Elmo's bag with saline so he can pretend he has one again
[2:07:45] <Enthaarungscreme> hire some rando to do it on the street
[2:07:45] <%BioApple> yoseph needs to inflate his balls so he can become as those tanuki spirits
[2:07:45] <Cranky_Construct> final fight yo
[2:07:47] <%joylent_blue> become as sack
[2:07:49] <ChaoticDaKiller> explore whole arena for items
[2:07:49] <+ProtagonistJake> Ok now you inject saline into your sister's balls

[2:08:00] <%Futurecity10> Was does Asuka inflation always come back to haunt me
[2:08:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Is that Millennium tower?
[2:08:02] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat for your Finale have Paige inject your balls with Saline on stream. The ban will be glorious!
[2:08:04] <%ScreamLord> And Rei would be into Bukakke

[2:11:56] <cosmictrashcan> why is he whispering lmao
[2:12:03] <Captain_Aham> yeah fucl that guy
[2:12:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> YO THE STAND'S SWORD SAYS "POLICE" ?!
[2:12:10] <%dekkitout> I just noticed how he's fucking monologing
[2:12:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sokumotanaka Idk, a lot of chimeras had fat tidds
[2:12:15] <mooselooseinthehoose> man is still fucking monologuing
[2:12:16] <%wydamn> @Sokumotanaka You're not that far off, actually
[2:12:27] <%StaceMcGate> seriously, he is explaining his master plan during the noisiest possible fucking battle
[2:12:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THAT IS FUCKING RADICAL
[2:12:34] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat remember you can use IRIS to check for HP on bosses?
[2:12:34] <+Jonesman64> the whole gang is here
[2:12:35] <b_ikki> everyone is here
[2:12:39] <%Capta1n_H3nry> He's not really whispering, it's just that you're in a crazy combat scenario
[2:12:40] <%Shadicara> I CHOOSE YOU MURDERCHU
[2:12:40] <%RantingRavager> BARDICHE
[2:12:48] <%BioApple> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson 「THE POLICE」
[2:12:49] <%Sokumotanaka> @Sphincter_Spelunker Idk my natural humaism is to find things with faces attractive
[2:12:50] <%malacante> BARDICHE is so much better than axe
[2:12:50] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Arrow cloaks
[2:12:52] <+Jonesman64> You missed Arm and Dog R
[2:12:53] <%joylent_blue> Arrow tricks around
[2:12:54] <%dekkitout> Ironically, the Stand's called [Fuck Da Police]
[2:12:59] <KTDelgado> remember folks, his stand still wants to murder the fuck out of him
[2:13:00] <ActualNobody6400> Aroow's still on the CW last I checked
[2:13:02] <gekizenbu> stealth camoflauge? Metal Gear?
[2:13:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> It goes invisible
[2:13:03] <%wydamn> Professor Oak: "WONDERFUL"
[2:13:05] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Use need Beast in order to see him all the time iirc
[2:13:11] <%Sokumotanaka> @wydamn Goddamnit I hate when I'm close
[2:13:13] <%hntronium> Good job Ninja Photographer Pat
[2:13:28] <hassanico1> Why does no one ever remember to check boss HP?
[2:13:34] <%gunzerkingdunce> @ktdelgado that's actually not the case, you'll see if pat makes the right choice
[2:13:36] <%corinv> Because you don't need to
[2:13:45] <agumon9000> NO
[2:13:46] <ActualNobody6400> BANG
[2:13:47] <agumon9000> nonononon
[2:13:49] <Tucker0603> WHAT THE FUCK
[2:13:49] <agumon9000> Welp
[2:13:49] <LandOfTheWay> wasted it
[2:13:50] <%mayorrev> DT
[2:13:52] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Aw yeah!
[2:13:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> reset
[2:13:54] <agumon9000> Wasted
[2:13:56] <%joylent_blue> because who cares about boss HP, just do fight
[2:13:57] <+BoboDaHobo> complete waste
[2:13:59] <agumon9000> Oh good
[2:14:00] <gekizenbu> oh he DT cancelled its fine
[2:14:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WAS THAT A SIN DEVIL TRIGGER
[2:14:02] <agumon9000> He got knocked out of it
[2:14:04] <%BioApple> these guys aren't really bosses
[2:14:05] <Tucker0603> didnt see that before
[2:14:12] <worldbrand> arrow legion's a pain in the ass in this fight
[2:14:16] <%wydamn> @LandOfTheWay you're not wrong.
[2:14:18] <%Shadicara> Does the DT actually take super long to charge?
[2:14:22] <%corinv> Yeah
[2:14:22] <agumon9000> YES
[2:14:26] <%hntronium> I'm sure Pat can recharge it back up
[2:14:28] <gekizenbu> super yes
[2:14:28] <%RantingRavager> DT
[2:14:29] <+BoboDaHobo> like an entire file
[2:14:30] <%wydamn> @Shadicara yeah
[2:14:31] <%hntronium> Hopefully
[2:14:33] <agumon9000> No it charges super fucking slowly
[2:14:41] <gekizenbu> if you do like a 3-4 sync chain it goes a bit faster but still
[2:14:44] <HawkGoggles2> If Pat's lucky he might build enough meter to DT in the very last seconds of the game.
[2:14:45] <hassanico1> oh my god yeah the speed is so slow
[2:14:46] <%Zombrocom> That's kinda lame, I hate when the super thing charges forever
[2:14:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Why can't you just snipe Yoseph?
[2:14:48] <agumon9000> Patt MIGHT get it by the end of the final boss
[2:14:55] <artificiallynatural> DT recharges with every sync attack. Poblem is, you gain so little per sync attack
[2:14:56] <%radda343> Akira's legion looks cooler than pat's
[2:15:01] <%SGrim> Is that the same roar as Zinogre?
[2:15:03] <%BioApple> he only used a bit of meter, he can probably get it again
[2:15:06] <%Shadicara> Is it at least super strong for how long it takes to charge or is it kinda meh?
[2:15:12] <%hntronium> As long as he gets it for the final boss then great
[2:15:13] <+BoboDaHobo> remember doggo for invisible
[2:15:14] <%Keyd00d> you need dog out
[2:15:15] <%joylent_blue> its super strong
[2:15:15] <%ArcanumMBD> @agumon9000 you can charge it fully from nothing on the final boss, it's fine
[2:15:16] <%RantingRavager> beast to find hidden enemies
[2:15:17] <+Jonesman64> why can't your arrow legion go invis?
[2:15:21] <%wydamn> Should have gotten your sister to seduce Yoseph and choke him out with a pillow.
[2:15:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Because we need answers @GeneralSCPatton Trying to not do another Jena
[2:15:35] <%joylent_blue> EZ
[2:15:38] <Captain_Aham> good dogo

[2:21:14] <%d00msdaydan> no getting punched back up this time
[2:21:16] <joedatuous> the dumb monster noises is making him kinda lame
[2:21:18] <karl_rex> It sounds like the last giant
[2:21:19] <%corinv> This last jumping part took me a couple
[2:21:19] <BioKnight99> is this in slow motion or did the boss sacrifice all his speed for strength
[2:21:21] <%Shadicara> This is a very good QTE
[2:21:21] <%NeroInfinite> It's intiating second impact
[2:21:21] <mankeyfigh> YO ARE BUT AN ANT BEFORE IT

[2:21:34] <%joylent_blue> everyone knows that when you get really big you also get really slow
[2:21:42] <ActualNobody6400> This fucking music
[2:21:43] <%radda343> why do evil go big when big is so slow
[2:21:46] <%wydamn> I mean, he's basically a living God, but all he's got are punches and eye lasers
[2:21:47] <%radda343> why not do smol evil
[2:21:48] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> SIR
[2:21:49] <+Jonesman64> to be fair that building was really tall and had a lot of wall and floor space for platform formation

[2:23:53] <LandOfTheWay> "final boss"

[2:23:54] <Dementedpenguin> This makes me want a Rez sequel
[2:23:55] <worldbrand> What? I like the final boss
[2:23:55] <%TendrilsTwitch> this isnt even my final form
[2:23:55] <%Chichen> Final boss is great
[2:23:55] <%kyh9> Reminds me of the boss from Kirby 64
[2:23:57] <joedatuous> eh its just fighting a cube
[2:23:58] <%wydamn> This is Phase 1
[2:23:58] <%dekkitout> It's like the 4th Angel, and that shit was cool
[2:23:59] <urkleturtle> that's one nier-ass boss
[2:23:59] <+JavaManJoJo> The people complaining are wrong
[2:23:59] <b_ikki> it looks super cool but its not very exciting

[2:24:01] <%Divryne> """Final boss"""

[2:24:02] <%Keyd00d> chat shut up
[2:24:02] <+BoboDaHobo> He thinks this is the final boss
[2:24:03] <Dead_Euronymous> Casuals think the final boss is too hard
[2:24:05] <+lordsdb> people hate the first part you went though
[2:24:06] <ActualNobody6400> Who the hell complained about this?!

[2:28:47] <%wydamn> @king_wragles that is so good
[2:28:47] <Bladeexe> it hints max merged with Axe legion
[2:28:48] <Asuxley> AXE WAS DAD THE ALL TIME
[2:28:48] <Ipsenscastle> YOU HAVE YOUR DAD ON A SLAVE CHAIN
[2:28:48] <+AthenOwl> The Emperor from House of the Dead?
[2:28:48] <gekizenbu> USE THE POWER OF YOUR [DAD]
[2:28:49] <+CaptainGrime> Dad Legion!
[2:28:52] <%PrinceOfEden> SLAVE DAD

[2:28:54] <gustavozxd> LITERALLY EVANGELION
[2:28:55] <+Darren716> THIS SONG SLAPS
[2:28:56] <ActualNobody6400> GOTTA SNAP A PIC FOR THE GRAM
[2:28:56] <+CaptainGrime> DAD LEGION
[2:28:56] <T3merity> wow that is INCREDIBLY Eva
[2:28:56] <Cdjgamer> time to die
[2:28:57] <BioKnight99> i mean we enslaved a dad in warframe too
[2:28:57] <%gunzerkingdunce> Humans and Chimeras are the same
[2:28:57] <%Laecerelius> From the framerate dimension to the platform dimension
[2:28:58] <%malacante> welcome to framerate dimension mk 3
[2:28:58] <%wydamn> That's on the level of "I wish Blastoise was my dad"
[2:28:58] <%ScreamLord> NOAH PRIME!
[2:28:58] <%dekkitout> No it's like how Eva are moms LU
[2:28:59] <%TenderBabyBacon> Framerates are better in the sky
[2:28:59] <%hntronium> Oh God
[2:28:59] <%nmaten> hey have you guys heard of this obscure anime called neon genesis evangelion?
[2:29:00] <SchroedingersFerret> MANSLAVE
[2:29:01] <%Razputin217> YOUR DAD IS YOUR STAND
[2:29:03] <%NeroInfinite> pop your DT
[2:29:03] <bleugh> chaos dadgion
[2:29:04] <agumon9000> Have fun. This fight is fucking bullsit
[2:29:06] <%hntronium> This is a sumbitch
[2:29:07] <DevinMayCry> I think its not that its your dad but that it asorbed your dad a bit because like, the astral plain reorganizes human data. Therefor its like, recycling your data. Sort of like when your legions reboot you
[2:29:08] <%ArcanumMBD> fucking orgasmic music
[2:29:08] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat IRIS GODDAMIT
[2:29:09] <%SGrim> BSDM SLAVE DADDY Kreygasm
[2:29:09] <+abuptabe> Time to use literally every single healing item you have
[2:29:10] <%king_wragles> @wydamn remember the part where your dad tells you to NEVER take off your chain thing? That's the second I knew
[2:29:12] <AwesomeDan_> Gotta enslave to save the human race.
[2:29:12] <Tonicky > pat got his dt back let's see how he uses it
[2:29:13] <%Keyd00d> enjoy the OHKOs
[2:29:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You're weird! @angriestpat
[2:29:15] <%shootbang_exe> the real ghost dad was anime all along
[2:29:17] <+lordsdb> FUSE WITH YOUR DAD!
[2:29:18] <+Darren716> At least he has all 4 batteries
[2:29:18] <AnDyLV> you put a chain on your dad and boss him around to swordfight with you
[2:29:19] <%ArcanumMBD> @mankeyfigh healthbars are for cowards
[2:29:19] <%ScreamLord> DT is charged
[2:29:20] <%skizzuto> I lost all my AED charges to this guy
[2:29:21] <+Jonesman64> so much meds used in this fight NotLikeThis
[2:29:25] <%ThatOneGameTester> Wait, does Axe also try to escape the chain or not?
[2:29:26] <WRFWD> Get ready to ride the beast legion at the first sign of danger
[2:29:27] <+BoboDaHobo> first half of this fight is real fun, second half is kind of just annoying
[2:29:28] <%PrinceOfEden> I died once here
[2:29:28] <+Darren716> I came in with 1 and the dome attack fucked me
[2:29:30] <Tucker0603> Health bar pat
[2:29:32] <Ipsenscastle> ENSLAVE YOUR FAMILY
[2:29:33] <%BioApple> also you control legions like they're body parts, not commanding them like slaves, so it could be your own subconscious doing that
[2:29:34] <DevinMayCry> That combo is the best one
[2:29:34] <%Sokumotanaka> TIS IS THE BOSS PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT? IT'S AWESOME!
[2:29:36] <+Darren716> IRIS him Pat
[2:29:38] <%TubeMan642> watch out he has an instant kill move
[2:29:39] <%joylent_blue> it's doing Urizen kicky combos LUL
[2:29:39] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Inception time! =D
[2:29:40] <%ArcanumMBD> @agumon9000 oh look pat has DT ready, your complaining earlier was for nothing
[2:29:44] <deviljhojho94> Barely
[2:29:45] <%dekkitout> Axe is relatively more calm compared to Arm and Sword
[2:29:49] <%Dr_Mooose> this epic ass music
[2:29:51] <gekizenbu> riding your beast legion didn't really work for me, i did the chain pulling
[2:29:54] <%Keyd00d> DIG UP
[2:30:03] <agumon9000> I thought he was gonna use it during phase 2 and blow it all
[2:30:03] <%MagickBurritoh> it protecc
[2:30:06] <%king_wragles> It doesn't thrash when you clean it, has no idle animation
[2:30:07] <gekizenbu> welcome to the neir zone
[2:30:07] <Dementedpenguin> Nier balls.
[2:30:08] <%Shadicara> Shame your sister didn't become the arrow legion
[2:30:10] <%StaceMcGate> The rest absorbed personality traits of their owners somewhat
[2:30:12] <b_ikki> as designed by yoko taro
[2:30:15] <+Darren716> Nah this is gun time
[2:30:16] <koolaid_kevster> gun
[2:30:16] <%king_wragles> I fucking KNEW IT
[2:30:23] <%wydamn> So we got Sword Legion, Arrow Legion, Arm Legion, Doggo Legion, and Dad Stand.
[2:30:23] <%korth367> apatJpeg
[2:30:25] <TehMud> Ah yes the difficulty spike boss
[2:30:28] <%shootbang_exe> iris for health meter?

[2:30:32] <%Shadicara> Axe Dad
[2:30:32] <%hntronium> Jesus Christ this boss
[2:30:35] <%Chichen> DEVIL TRIGGER
[2:30:37] <ActualNobody6400> A Lappy Special?
[2:30:38] <%dekkitout> A commercial break?

[2:30:48] <%skizzuto> FRUSTRATION IS GETTING BIGGER
[2:30:49] <%wydamn> Man, I love the frenetic piano in this music.
[2:30:49] <+Demopoot> BANG BANG BANG
[2:30:49] <gekizenbu> fuse with your dad
[2:30:50] <%Keyd00d> this boss is way harder than the rest of the game combined
[2:30:51] <%StaceMcGate> I DT and then the boss went to 2nd phase, interrupting my transformation
[2:30:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> Becomes as DAD
[2:30:53] <gekizenbu> for more devil trigger
[2:30:54] <karl_rex> Look at all that forbidden grape juice
[2:30:55] <HawkGoggles2> I can't wait for the cutscene to cancel it.
[2:30:56] <%Ion_Laser> BANG BANG BANG
[2:30:58] <DevinMayCry> THIS COULD BE THE END OF TIME. THIS COULD BE THE END OF ME
[2:30:58] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat check its HP with IRIS?
[2:30:59] <%MasterDecoder> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER

[2:32:49] <%wydamn> @i_am_therydon LUL
[2:32:51] <TehMud> Damn Pat's doing this way easier than I did. I must've been underleveled.... or Pat's overleveled. I had nowhere near 2k HP
[2:33:02] <%Keyd00d> pat's been grinding a lot
[2:33:03] <%wydamn> Put SALINE in that ball!
[2:33:05] <hassanico1> SHOOT SALINE INTO THE BALL

[2:33:28] <gekizenbu> im more surprised the black hole hasn't been spammed
[2:33:29] <%ArcanumMBD> @TehMud pat replayed a bunch between streams, so yeah he's overleveled. I think i had 1.2k hp doing this
[2:33:36] <deviljhojho94> OH SHIT

[2:33:39] <%joylent_blue> yeah

[2:34:01] <+Darren716> I hope he gets hit by the black hole once just to see it

[2:42:10] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Jena's plan was the exact same as Yoseph's
[2:42:11] <+Darren716> He wanted to become as god
[2:42:12] <fugnuggets01> because anime
[2:42:13] <worldbrand> aren't some of them still passworded?
[2:42:13] <%dekkitout> Like going in to JoJo's fresh at part 2
[2:42:13] <MoonlightP> we still have no clue who the fuck yoseph was talking to at the start of the game
[2:42:13] <+RootVeggie> lmao and the ending theme is called "The Answer"
[2:42:13] <+VGGary> he wanted humanity to evolve because become as gods
[2:42:14] <artificiallynatural> Its such a sloppily told story
[2:42:14] <%wydamn> You get more explanation at the start of File 12
[2:42:14] <AmericanaRed> SEQUEL
[2:42:14] <%DeathsDoom> that is the platnium standard
[2:42:14] <+rorschachsjournal505> You gotta read the filea
[2:42:16] <TheAzureOracle> YEAH BUT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM ISN'T SOLVED
[2:42:17] <Bladeexe> ugh do I have to read that shit?
[2:42:19] <ShichiNoBushi> The only explanation on where the chimeras come from was a meteor.
[2:42:19] <DevinMayCry> Yoseph wanted to force evolution. So does Jena
[2:42:20] <%dekkitout> What about Kyle?
[2:42:20] <OldManDeckardCain> HE WAS JUST DOING HIS GENDO COSPLAY FOR HALLOWEEN LUL
[2:42:21] <%Shadicara> BECOME AS GODS
[2:42:21] <%ScrubTheNerd> He saw the EVA reference happening and wanted to be the bad guy
[2:42:22] <Cdjgamer> the plot is to become gods
[2:42:23] <WRFWD> No, read Akira's file in File 12
[2:42:23] <%Shadicara> That's the plan
[2:42:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> If you never answer anything, then no one can point out the holes and flaws in the logic.
[2:42:24] <%Laecerelius> Like apparently the apocalypse has happened twice before and this is the third impact
[2:42:25] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat No Patt you need to read the character files in the the persons of interest database
[2:42:26] <Finaldragoon> 1
[2:42:26] <+Darren716> She wanted to stop Yoseph
[2:42:27] <AwesomeDan_> Jena is never explained
[2:42:27] <%Keyd00d> Is the world still doomed?
[2:42:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND! - Jena
[2:42:31] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat JENA WAS TRYING TO STOP YOSEPH'S BULLSHIT
[2:42:32] <%PrinceOfEden> Jena's goal, yoseph's plan, what are the chimera's, what is the astral plane?
[2:42:34] <cureneckbeard> JENOVA
[2:42:34] <%malacante> Jena straight-up tells you what Chimeras are for. Yoseph just wanted to do the same thing, but he's in controll
[2:42:36] <ChamoCamouflage> Yoseph wants Singularity. Jena wants to stop her -- and she's so fucking insane she's not answering shit.
[2:42:40] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Patt you need to read the character files in the the persons of interest database
[2:42:43] <DevinMayCry> Jena is explained. She was gonna reboot humanity using the astral plain
[2:42:43] <WRFWD> Jena created the homunculi, they absorbed chimeras
[2:42:43] <%ArcanumMBD> I feel Jena and Yoseph has the same plan, just different ways of going about it
[2:42:43] <Dementedpenguin> Thanks Mario Club.
[2:42:46] <%ScreamLord> "I tried to warn you!" NO YOU DIDN'T YOU DUMB BITCH!
[2:42:48] <%BioApple> stop yoesph by doing exactly what he's doing , but cheaper
[2:42:48] <%ThatOneGameTester> twoelve
[2:42:51] <Bladeexe> I think Jena just wanted everyone to just give in and embrace the Astral Plane.
[2:42:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Marie the janitor has huge chest beefers. That was explained super well.
[2:42:57] <%MrCalieb> thank you li tian
[2:42:58] <WRFWD> Yoseph wanted to do to humanity the same as the Astral Plane
[2:43:01] <DevinMayCry> She was only stopping yoseph to do her own
[2:43:02] <%Laecerelius> Nobody explained the SELEE guys and how they knew about this or who they were
[2:43:04] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Jena's plan was to turn humans into Chimeras, Yosephs plan was merge everyone into one Chimera. TOTALLY DIFFERENT
[2:43:05] <+Darren716> @AngriestPat How would you rank that ending compared to other Platinum games?
[2:43:07] <ChamoCamouflage> 'Cuz Jena's fucking nutso.
[2:43:07] <Tonicky > Kyle just disappeared from the plot so did Jin and Alycia pretty much
[2:43:07] <%joylent_blue> it was very unclear
[2:43:08] <Tisaric> Not to mention Dad never died on screen
[2:43:08] <%skizzuto> but the how/why she wanted to stop Yoseph is unclear
[2:43:11] <+OUTheTeam> he used her research Pat
[2:43:12] <Finaldragoon> she did explain it, she wanted Earth to get absorbed into the Astral Plane to "purify" it
[2:43:19] <Hellarussian> I dont understand tho
[2:43:19] <+VGGary> Jena introduces you to the blue evolve to let you figure it out yourself
[2:43:20] <%Keyd00d> @AngriestPat Is this still your favorite Plat game?
[2:43:20] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat No Patt you need to read the character files in the the persons of interest database
[2:43:22] <%MrCalieb> this one goes out to you yuuji wada
[2:43:25] <%joylent_blue> it was fine
[2:43:25] <+Darren716> Because W101 is still on top
[2:43:25] <gustavozxd> "my plan's better" - other villain
[2:43:25] <Ajanimentorofheros> He used her research.
[2:43:26] <NeroIscariot12> Jena wanted to use the Homunculus to FIGHT the Astral Plane and keep their humanity. Yosef wanted instrumentality @AngriestPat
[2:43:28] <%d00msdaydan> nowhere near mgr's ending tbh
[2:43:28] <DevinMayCry> @Laecerelius Its the UNION who cut off the other areas we go to. Total big bads for next game
[2:43:28] <%malacante> She just kinda drops on you that Chimeras are made by a progenitor species to recycle humanity and that's really the whole story
[2:43:29] <doggieo> Better than BAYO2
[2:43:33] <%42nfl19> You punched dimensions @AngriestPat
[2:43:33] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> That's right, Jay
[2:43:35] <+ProtagonistJake> One was just pure Chimera but Yoshpas was fusing Chimeras and Humans
[2:43:35] <%BioApple> no one explained how the astral plane takeover was PREDICTED BY PROPHETS
[2:43:37] <+Darren716> Its sad that W101 will never be topped
[2:43:37] <lethallylactic> ResidentSleeper
[2:43:38] <%joylent_blue> wtf i liked Bayo 2's ending
[2:43:41] <%TendrilsTwitch> Space is reserved for game 2 or 3
[2:43:44] <%Keyd00d> This doesn't even touch W101 or Bayo for me
[2:43:48] <TCCBros> Bad run start over
[2:43:48] <DevinMayCry> Theres more Pat
[2:43:50] <+ProtagonistJake> no again
[2:43:51] <%shootbang_exe> reread akira's in file 12
[2:43:51] <SlimeSlimeSlime> First Platinum game in my library, first Platinum game in my heart. <3
[2:43:53] <+OUTheTeam> no read again pat
[2:43:54] <WRFWD> No, read them AGAIN in File 12
[2:43:54] <ne0bunny> they seemed to have the same plan, but both wanted to be the biggest dick to do it
[2:43:55] <+Darren716> The entire like final 3 hours of 101 is so nuts
[2:43:56] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat No after the ending they get updated
[2:43:56] <%shootbang_exe> importante
[2:43:58] <%wydamn> Jenna: FOOLS, you're just MAKING THINGS WORSE! Me: Why are we fools? How are we making it worse? Why are you doing this? Jenna: Shut up and maybe I'll let you live!
[2:43:59] <+RootVeggie> I like the gameplay the most for this game
[2:43:59] <%Koosahmii> You just want the answers to be complicated
[2:43:59] <+nekodelic> in that comparison, are you counting Nier in the list?
[2:44:00] <%nmaten> cause theyre prophets
[2:44:01] <lethallylactic> It's magic, don't gotta explain shit
[2:44:02] <+abuptabe> Or who the three voices talking to Yoseph were
[2:44:02] <+Jonesman64> W101 is probably my favorite...
[2:44:03] <ShichiNoBushi> The Dead Sea Scrolls?
[2:44:03] <%Laecerelius> Or how they knew it happened twice before
[2:44:06] <AwesomeDan_> its really hard to top wonderful 101's finale.
[2:44:09] <%Keyd00d> I thank
[2:44:10] <PrimeNeverproc> what are profits tho
[2:44:11] <ChamoCamouflage> @gustavozxd Yeah, basically. It was just a dick-waving contest between Jena, and Yoseph of "I can save the world"
[2:44:12] <+Jonesman64> Cause its happened before apparently
[2:44:13] <%ShaneWhite> It’s anime no need for explanation
[2:44:14] <KaliasTV> Should have photo'd more Lappy
[2:44:14] <%nmaten> thank
[2:44:14] <%BioApple> thank mr pat
[2:44:14] <MoonlightP> we do have a possible two other games to explain this shit
[2:44:15] <%RantingRavager> Thank
[2:44:16] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat After the ending the persons of interest database gets updated
[2:44:16] <%MrCalieb> does platinum games be the ones that did the niers and whatnot
[2:44:17] <%dekkitout> To those who thanked
[2:44:17] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:44:18] <%wydamn> Pat will now READ the people that THANKED
[2:44:20] <%mister___doctor> They never explain why those booty shorts gotta be so god damn tight
[2:44:21] <%Keyd00d> thank mr skeltel
[2:44:21] <worldbrand> The people thank again
[2:44:23] <the__magic_conch> they both wanted humanity to evolve but in different ways
[2:44:23] <+Matto424> Yeah if you run outta photos you took they have a bunch of photos to fill in the gaps
[2:44:24] <TheAzureOracle> Yes, Paige the prophet predicted the coming of the Astral plane
[2:44:27] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Seele got away with their evil bullshit in the end too.
[2:44:31] <%ScrubTheNerd> Thank, Mr Patal
[2:44:35] <Blank9> your own mental saline
[2:44:35] <+CCCPKi> Mental saline
[2:44:36] <%velemi> MENTAL SALINE
[2:44:38] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat is this the end of the stream?
[2:44:39] <%Capta1n_H3nry> @AngriestPat I believe Jena and Yoseph's goals were similar, but different enough for the two to disagree. Jena wanted to store and make humanity evolve through the Astral Plane. Yoseph wanted to do the same, albeit a bit more controlled, through Noah.
[2:44:39] <$Kenzo2000> Your own mental saline
[2:44:42] <cureneckbeard> Read the people who thanked
[2:44:44] <TCCBros> yall wana get pizza?
[2:44:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> It is clearly having a sequel planned, it felt like a lot of stuff went nowhere
[2:44:48] <DevinMayCry> @SlimeSlimeSlime Trilogy so gonna happen
[2:44:49] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat What wasn't answered was Jena's [plan past beating YOSEPH, she apparently thought she could save humanity somehow. She was crazy tho, creating homunculi and wreaking havoc
[2:44:49] <%MrCalieb> apatWhat
[2:44:58] <%dekkitout> Seele-ine
[2:45:00] <doggieo> Chimeras are PEOPLE
[2:45:01] <%Keyd00d> Jena explained the astral plane earlier
[2:45:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Meteor or something.
[2:45:03] <%Keyd00d> sort of
[2:45:03] <bleugh> what was that black goo
[2:45:03] <Tisaric> There's a bunch of loose ends
[2:45:05] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat The Persons of Interest database gets updated after the credits. Mostly your sister and Yoseph
[2:45:07] <ChamoCamouflage> Jena explained the Astral Plane.
[2:45:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> I want Kyle to return
[2:45:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @DevinMayCry I hope so!
[2:45:10] <gustavozxd> astral chain 0
[2:45:12] <%Laecerelius> Hopefully in the sequel we go to space
[2:45:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have to read the part where I said ABSOLUTELY HARAM! It's a funny meme.
[2:45:12] <+rorschachsjournal505> @conlin_arts_ A trilogy planned I guess if this game were successful
[2:45:13] <%wydamn> awww
[2:45:15] <%wydamn> that pic
[2:45:16] <+Demopoot> "Why does he need the twins" He doesn't he outright says he was just overlooking their imperfections due to their service
[2:45:19] <%PrinceOfEden> DAD PHOTO
[2:45:20] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat Ok wait they totally explained CHimeras and the Astral Plain, they were made to recycle humans by some other race
[2:45:23] <%gunzerkingdunce> It was super successful
[2:45:24] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat The Persons of Interest database gets updated after the credits. Mostly your sister and Yoseph.
[2:45:25] <%BioApple> I think there's something about the twins being born in a corrupted zone that he couldn't replicate in the ARI
[2:45:26] <ChamoCamouflage> It was basically "where everything returns" or some shit.
[2:45:27] <WRFWD> Jena spent 20 years in the Astral Plane and survived somehow, that probably fucks with your social skills and sanity
[2:45:28] <KaliasTV> Remember when Jena was all "Aliens will reclaim all life, lol"
[2:45:30] <Ether101_Prime> I bet Astral Plane will be imaginary number space or something like that.
[2:45:31] <bleugh> why did the bad guy think it was a good idea to inflate his balls
[2:45:36] <%MrCalieb> whatt im is that in the UK ?
[2:45:40] <%MrCalieb> TIME
[2:45:42] <%MrCalieb> oop
[2:45:47] <%wydamn> @KaliasTV I actually forgot about that, but that's true.
[2:45:49] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat The sequel is going to teach you the astral plane is the underside of the realm of darkness, inside Akira's X-blade
[2:45:51] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[2:45:52] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat you gonna stream the liveletter?
[2:45:53] <%Laecerelius> I guess you're now the leader of the police or whatever
[2:45:53] <%hntronium> Now that that's over with, Paige, please do go on about saline balls
[2:45:54] <Tisaric> they never fucking explained why the twins are special either god
[2:45:54] <%Tenchi_G> It's for the EU. Thanks Pat
[2:45:56] <%Sokumotanaka> @KaliasTV Remember when jena took a baht? lol not me
[2:45:58] <%dekkitout> tajC F
[2:45:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @MrCalieb Like 8 pm UK time
[2:45:58] <kc703> like 9pm
[2:46:03] <%Mr_Strut> RIP big balls
[2:46:03] <TCCBros> brb gunna inject my balls
[2:46:05] <gustavozxd> it felt good for a bit
[2:46:09] <%hntronium> Explodoballs
[2:46:10] <oJxn> @AngriestPat Also why are the twins special?
[2:46:12] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is Paige going to play a McDonalds?
[2:46:13] <%wydamn> They'll get SALINE POISONING
[2:46:13] <+nekodelic> unfortunately they won't die
[2:46:13] <%malacante> The twins are special because they were born out of a redshifting mother
[2:46:14] <Tucker0603> they gonna be in a hospital
[2:46:14] <%Ion_Laser> RIP apatBig Balls
[2:46:15] <%miguelrod777> @tisaric mom was redshifting during birth
[2:46:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I always thought that Dr. Phil would be the one to kill Dick Masterson.
[2:46:20] <+BoboDaHobo> RIP Big Balls
[2:46:21] <artificiallynatural> What doctor agrees to inject saline into someone's balls?
[2:46:23] <+HyperCharge_Sam> They explained that the twins were born during the Pandemic in Zone 09, so they might be infused with Redshift or something
[2:46:24] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why are they even doing it anyways?
[2:46:24] <%shadowace2400> TIME FOR THE BOY VOICE
[2:46:24] <DevinMayCry> Astral Plain like, breaks down people and reforms them into chimera. Jena was using the astral plain to evolve humans into her own design, Yoseph was using the chimeras reboot function of twins to create an angel to asorb all life into a singular synced being. A legion of all humankind he controlled
[2:46:24] <%LoneFonte> balls exploded on stream
[2:46:26] <%PrinceOfEden> Yeah, a lot of stuff was left unexplained. So we better get clarification in the sequel at the least.
[2:46:28] <$Yakobro> C
[2:46:29] <%Keyd00d> >S
[2:46:30] <%MrCalieb> @Sphincter_Spelunker thank you thank you i just kinda check late at night and hope for the best

[2:46:48] <DevinMayCry> SISTER GONE
[2:46:48] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why is Paige's friend's inflating their balls anyways?

[2:46:50] <%MrCalieb> thankful for play
[2:46:50] <ChamoCamouflage> @AngriestPat It's actually fine. Scrotum Saline Inflation is also temporary.

[2:55:04] <%wydamn> @MrCalieb phrasing
[2:55:08] <%StaceMcGate> I can't believe the meaning behind the Astral Plane was in the database, what the fuck
[2:55:10] <%Starlight_Gamer> is there anymore story in ch 12?
[2:55:13] <cureneckbeard> peepoops
[2:55:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @HRDSalami654 wtf?
[2:55:15] <%Ion_Laser> Time for apatBig Piss
[2:55:36] <PrimeNeverproc> good timing, need a pee myself
[2:55:41] <%Shadicara> Time to deflate nuts
[2:55:44] <zenith0111> PEEPEE
[2:55:44] <DevinMayCry> @StaceMcGate I legit never saw it until just now. I just knew what it did not why lol. All I read was Akiras
[2:55:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Times must be tough is people are injecting stuff into their balls for content
[2:55:47] <%StaceMcGate> @Starlight_Gamer no, 71 redcases where you fight and solve puzzles. The reward is a super hard boss
[2:55:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> if people*
[2:56:12] <%Rlexp> apatBig apatDab
[2:56:32] <%dekkitout> I look forward to ball inflation becoming the tide pod challenge of 2020
[2:56:42] <zenith0111> calebKek
[2:56:45] <%StaceMcGate> @DevinMayCry I read the database before and didn't it updated. Holy shit, the truth behind everything is two sentences in Yoseph's bio
[2:57:06] <DevinMayCry> I like how this game handles big spoilers. A lot of them just arent. Like Red Cop isnt a spoiler, the ravens are the real spoiler
[2:57:25] <DevinMayCry> Game knows you know who red cop is and doesnt pretend to hide it
[2:57:36] <+VGGary> does anyone know if i lose progress on the file 12 cases if i go back to an earlier file?
[2:57:36] <%dekkitout> The true spoilers were the friends we made along the way~
[2:57:42] <beetbo2> ^
[2:57:50] <DevinMayCry> @VGGary No. Go back to your hearts content
[2:57:51] <TCCBros> we made friends?
[2:57:52] <+HyperCharge_Sam> You can figure out what Yoseph was doing if you read the very first file. The reason he built the ARK was because prophets told him to do it pre-emptively to avoid humanity being extincted for a third time
[2:58:01] <%joylent_blue> i was really surprised at how much red cop turned out to not be an antagonist
[2:58:03] <beetbo2> the true Astral Chain were the imoutos we met along the way
[2:58:05] <hassanico1> I swear people erased Jena's Astral Plain explanation from their brain or something
[2:58:12] <zenith0111> Are friends like gacha prizes?
[2:58:14] <+VGGary> @DevinMayCry cheers, been spooked since it mentions losing all data on current file
[2:58:16] <zenith0111> PogChamp
[2:58:16] <%joylent_blue> Akira's cool pretty much the whole time, minus the mental breakdown
[2:58:17] <DevinMayCry> @VGGary Not just that, all your completipon of blue cases are counted and replaying missions doesnt have to be perfect each run, its all best of
[2:58:23] <beetbo2> @zenith0111 no, imoutos are
[2:58:29] <%mister___doctor> The true Astral Chain was the shorts we wore along the way
[2:58:37] <beetbo2> after all, we got alot on hand
[2:58:38] <DevinMayCry> @VGGary Game auto saves often it will lose data not saved after an auto save
[2:58:41] <%NeroInfinite> JEna EXPLAINED NOTHING DUDE
[2:58:42] <beetbo2> overflowing with imouto clones
[2:58:55] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Jena never explained what SHE was trying to do though
[2:58:58] <zenith0111> @beetbo2 LUL
[2:59:22] <+heroicspiritavenger> Truly we were the Astral Chain of Imouto Harems
[2:59:28] <beetbo2> ^
[2:59:37] <hassanico1> @NeroInfinite She totally mentioned how the Astral Plain and Chimeras were designed to recycle humans by some precursor race
[2:59:41] <DevinMayCry> Jena was just not Yoseph. She was evolving mankind using Astral Plain too.
[2:59:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Jena was saving humanity, duh
[3:00:05] <%flagi64> @sphincter_spelunker not too sure about that
[3:00:05] <beetbo2> define save
[3:00:16] <%Zombrocom> Let's be real, the story was nonsense. Cool game though.
[3:00:18] <+HyperCharge_Sam> All Jena wanted to do was save humanity without the use of Chimera's, but her end goal and the whole Hummonculos shit was never explained at all
[3:00:19] <%joylent_blue> just save humanity 4Head
[3:00:20] <%RantingRavager> Save = continued existence?
[3:00:28] <$mooselooseinthehoose> stream still on?
[3:00:29] <+Jonesman64> she was going to turn them into chimeras that wouldn't be absorbed by the astral plane and keep their individuality
[3:00:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Sphincter_Spelunker Was Jena legit the good guy? I only caught like every 3rd LP of this and am missing all the lore.
[3:00:30] <%iamtrlly> Did Pat fall in???
[3:00:40] <beetbo2> Pat's in the Astral Plane now
[3:00:40] <zenith0111> And then they kill the bad guy da end
[3:00:41] <Blank9> the idea for jena was everyone just gets absorbed into the astral plane to live as data
[3:00:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> probably taking a dump
[3:00:46] <b1gboss007> F
[3:00:47] <DevinMayCry> She created a lifeform that fed on chimera instead of humans being devoured by them. She was trying to reverse the predator prey dynamic of the astral plain to have her twisted version on top
[3:00:48] <+Darren716> Pat left to drop paint
[3:00:51] <%Shonen_hero> Shonen_hero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Pat, if it's a clone of your sister you are still technically related, and thus probably should not be dated. If it was weird in EVA it's even weirder now.
[3:00:54] <ChamoCamouflage> I wouldn't call Jena the good guy. She's also kinda fucking insane.
[3:00:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dump brown paint
[3:01:04] <PrimeNeverproc> sexy time in progress
[3:01:07] <ChamoCamouflage> Y'know, with the whole actual terrorism
[3:01:12] <%wydamn> My Interp: Jenna wanted humans to stay human, but live in a shitty world. Yoseph wanted humans to become CUBE.
[3:01:16] <%flagi64> so is this how we get the ending for eva, 71 more movies?
[3:01:17] <%dekkitout> A lot of the bosses this stream really need to be Legions next game, Eris, Scylla, and Agamemnon were too cool to be one offs
[3:01:31] <DevinMayCry> No harpy legion is sad.
[3:01:36] <+HyperCharge_Sam> @DevinMayCry Oh, I can see that I suppose
[3:01:38] <+heroicspiritavenger> I for one would date the clone of the imouto I don’t even have. It’s free real estate.
[3:01:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FirearmsInstructor they tried to go "for a greater good" stuff. but Jena was clearly nuts from being in the Astral Plane for 20 years. She went on and on about us being puppets and blind to the truth
[3:01:39] <+Jonesman64> BECOME AS CUBIX
[3:01:39] <DevinMayCry> You fight them a lot and they were a concept
[3:01:41] <%iamtrlly> Pat's creating an Asstral chain right now
[3:01:43] <beetbo2> @wydamn you mean humanity becomes the GAMING CUBE
[3:01:48] <%RantingRavager> H E L L O
[3:01:49] <DevinMayCry> You can see a ton of the chimera in legion form from art book
[3:01:52] <%wydamn> @dekkitout I said it before, it's pronounced "ERITH"
[3:01:52] <beetbo2> all will be used for Pat's computer gaming
[3:01:53] <%joylent_blue> Jena wanted humans to exist in red crystal form basically, like all the humanoid shadows you see in the Astral Plain
[3:01:55] <%skizzuto> wao
[3:01:56] <DevinMayCry> Slime Legion was one
[3:02:01] <beetbo2> howdy
[3:02:01] <%wydamn> @beetbo2 GAMING CUBE
[3:02:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> There could be many more legion types in sequels
[3:02:05] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat you only get one of the DT in a Can
[3:02:06] <%Shonen_hero> Doing good
[3:02:07] <%42nfl19> where is lappy ;_;
[3:02:10] <%isolex_> How was dumping the bucket of paint
[3:02:13] <%42nfl19> and my lappy combos
[3:02:16] <beetbo2> All of humanity will become the gaming cube
[3:02:16] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Sphincter_Spelunker 20 years? Damn missed that detail.
[3:02:19] <%LocoCrazy_> Haha
[3:02:20] <%corinv> You can only hold one of the DT in a can but you can buy more any time you want
[3:02:21] <+Darren716> Pat do at least 1 of Olive's cases, youll get a new legion color
[3:02:21] <%kyh9> Slime Legion
[3:02:28] <Bailey__gaming> hi everyone
[3:02:32] <%flagi64> So is it ever explained how dad became legion?
[3:02:34] <%mayorrev> Did you get all the Lappy items?
[3:02:35] <DevinMayCry> @FirearmsInstructor Its to set up Daddy returning in sequel
[3:02:36] <+TSmasher1000> LUL
[3:02:37] <%dekkitout> ...
[3:02:37] <beetbo2> wasn't rei the clone of his mother?
[3:02:37] <%Shonen_hero> LUL
[3:02:37] <%RantingRavager> hi friend @Bailey__gaming
[3:02:39] <%king_wragles> .......
[3:02:39] <%dekkitout> He's right...
[3:02:41] <+TSmasher1000> SWEET HOME ALABAMA
[3:02:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Clones aren't relatives
[3:02:42] <AwesomeDan_> incest is legal in anime
[3:02:42] <RupanSen> unless the fetish demands it
[3:02:43] <beetbo2> thus she's a milf?
[3:02:49] <%hntronium> Talk to everyone?
[3:02:52] <%king_wragles> Don't let him justify this chat
[3:02:55] <+twohitgood> i mean it doesn't always turn out bad. conan o brien is a product of incest.
[3:02:56] <Bailey__gaming> hey @rantingravager how's it going
[3:02:58] <+TSmasher1000> @AngriestPat Does this mean anime secretly takes place in Alabama and not Japan Pat?
[3:03:01] <zenith0111> Oni-San rmzGASM
[3:03:02] <%rdark_ksu> if its only one generation incest is actually not going to make the mutants you'd expect, gotta get 2 or more levels deep for the weird shit
[3:03:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Akira is at best 50% your sister now.
[3:03:03] <ChaoticDaKiller> IT'S NOT INCEST IF IT'S A BIG TITTY ONEE SAN YOU GUYS
[3:03:05] <%dekkitout> You thing we're trying!? @king_wragles
[3:03:07] <%ThaSparren> @AngriestPat I think my dono didnt pop
[3:03:10] <%dekkitout> *think
[3:03:11] <%RantingRavager> @Bailey__gaming just watching the stream, hbu?
[3:03:13] <Mendin> @AngriestPat The one you're missing is from the mission you had to dress up as Lappy, you didn't win the Jin f ight
[3:03:14] <DevinMayCry> @flagi64 The chimera asorb human data. His legion most likely gained a lot of Max in him like how Akira legion did her enabling the retrival of her memories to be put into a clone
[3:03:20] <%corinv> @AngriestPat The one you're probably missing is the one for beating Jin to 100% in the side case in file 5
[3:03:20] <%wydamn> @flagi64 I'm assuming Dad is the true final boss, and Dad stand was just imprinted with him, but I don't know for sure since this is the farthest I got
[3:03:25] <+HyperCharge_Sam> @flagi64 The Legions seek out their owners and absorb them into their body, I think. You get a hint of it when the Arm Legion does it to Jin before you save them
[3:03:29] <%MoraMiarty> yooo that color is rad
[3:03:44] <hassanico1> OPTICAL CAMO PAPER
[3:03:46] <DevinMayCry> @flagi64 I am VERY certain the legion isnt literally dad. And that Dads still out there
[3:03:46] <doggieo> ILL IT BE FREED
[3:03:53] <Kejang> BIG POOPER ACHIEVEMENT
[3:04:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Do you need to beat bloody palace for the red cop chains?
[3:04:02] <Bailey__gaming> @rantingravager I'm good I just got in
[3:04:05] <%dekkitout> 100 grit sandpaper
[3:04:05] <beetbo2> toilet fairy returns
[3:04:06] <%hntronium> SANDPAPER NOT GOOD
[3:04:08] <hassanico1> Wait Sandpaper isn't even paper!
[3:04:10] <Tucker0603> SANDPAPER
[3:04:12] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This guy's full of shit. D:<
[3:04:13] <+TSmasher1000> Does anyone/has anyone actually done that irl? They ask for toilet paper from a stranger or even a friend/colleague and not a close family member? WutFace
[3:04:15] <$mooselooseinthehoose> Hey pat, how's elmo doing?
[3:04:18] <%RantingRavager> @Bailey__gaming watch the vods, shit is crazy
[3:04:22] <PrimeNeverproc> finish doggo
[3:04:24] <%Laecerelius> Attack up 25%! Nice!
[3:04:30] <Captain_Aham> give him duct tape
[3:04:36] <%Laecerelius> I think you can finish doggo
[3:04:45] <Mendin> Finish doggo to get another code
[3:04:46] <%hntronium> Finish off the beast? It might give you another premium
[3:04:49] <+Darren716> Finish Dog so you get another premium
[3:04:51] <doggieo> bottom is a slot I think on Arrow
[3:04:55] <+RowenCleric> favorite legion?
[3:05:07] <hassanico1> Huh, why is Speed Star so far in for beast?
[3:05:25] <%corinv> Speed Star is more useful in combat than the others just thanks to having an auto dodge
[3:05:29] <%corinv> So its skills aren't as good
[3:05:39] <hassanico1> ah i see
[3:05:45] <%corinv> Beast Legion is more useful* whoops
[3:05:59] <%joylent_blue> awwww
[3:06:00] <Tucker0603> thats great
[3:06:02] <DevinMayCry> Talk to people in break room on B2
[3:06:03] <%Chichen> EVERYONE GETS A SLAVE
[3:06:03] <hassanico1> SLAVES FOR EVERYONE
[3:06:06] <Tucker0603> he got his pupper

[3:06:06] <artificiallynatural> so happy for mike
[3:06:07] <%hntronium> Did you chat with Brenda?
[3:06:08] <%Keyd00d> oof
[3:06:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Do your legions still hate you?
[3:06:09] <%RantingRavager> wait, is the legion/person dynamic still a master/slave thing?
[3:06:11] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat YOU get a Legion and YOU get a Legion!
[3:06:12] <%dekkitout> Ew
[3:06:14] <hassanico1> YOU GET A SLAVE AND YOU GET A SLAVE
[3:06:15] <Ajanimentorofheros> Yeah he gets his favorite type of slave!
[3:06:16] <%ScrubTheNerd> It's weird that they just stopped after 5 kinds of Legion
[3:06:16] <RupanSen> I know the feeling
[3:06:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ron White joke, nice
[3:06:25] <%RantingRavager> Do the legions still hate being enslaved by cops?
[3:06:29] <%Sokumotanaka> so we never adressed the slavery thing huh...
[3:06:31] <artificiallynatural> can you pet the beast legion now?
[3:06:37] <DevinMayCry> @ScrubTheNerd A few logs explain why some chimera were not made into legions
[3:06:37] <Moonlit_Wisp> It's 2019 we all deserve Slaves.
[3:06:40] <hassanico1> @Sokumotanaka I mean they are murdering the human race
[3:06:46] <+Demopoot> @ScrubTheNerd Each legion type is made from a different chimera type, so they ran out of different chimeras, not ideas
[3:06:47] <Mendin> Check the Cat Shelter pat
[3:06:53] <joedatuous> i wish i had a slave
[3:07:06] <%kyh9> The spirit realm will be sequel fodder
[3:07:07] <%Sokumotanaka> @Moonlit_Wisp Even as a joke that's a fucking yikes from me
[3:07:08] <%king_wragles> @RantingRavager That's a good question, and I'm glad you asked that. You see the thing about... oh hey look at that! A new vending machine to take a picture of! Let's go!
[3:07:09] <%ScrubTheNerd> @DevinMayCry @Demopoot But my slime legion
[3:07:10] <%wydamn> @ScrubTheNerd I feel the same way, but I'd also hate it if I was that one cop that got the "Snail" legion.
[3:07:10] <+Darren716> AStral Chain 2: Spirit Realm
[3:07:11] <%dekkitout> She's not entirely wrong
[3:07:12] <hassanico1> "We didn't give a Legion to Shizu."
[3:07:18] <Ajanimentorofheros> Even more sequel stuff!
[3:07:23] <%RantingRavager> @king_wragles PogChamp A VENDING MACHINE

[3:07:41] <ChaoticDaKiller> ALL THE SEQUEL BAITING
[3:07:43] <DevinMayCry> @ScrubTheNerd Theres official design art of Slime Legion at least
[3:07:44] <+mcjimbo12> every line of dialogue is sequel bait
[3:07:47] <Wan6Saber> hit her from the back Kappa
[3:07:47] <Ether101_Prime> Could use weapons that are effective.
[3:08:01] <Moonlit_Wisp> Stands drkeckHype
[3:08:02] <%dekkitout> I need to get my hands on this game's art book...
[3:08:10] <%RantingRavager> OH THEY HATE BEING SLAVES
[3:08:14] <DevinMayCry> 14 months until sequel?
[3:08:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she misses the daddy dick
[3:08:34] <hassanico1> Alicia never got to fuck...
[3:08:34] <%42nfl19> So is she your new mom or what?
[3:08:41] <%kyh9> AXE LEGION, GO FUCK ALICIA
[3:08:49] <DevinMayCry> Im so certain its not yo dad. He just became like your dad
[3:08:50] <Ajanimentorofheros> Go Axe!
[3:08:50] <%joylent_blue> well Alicia, get on it
[3:08:50] <%RantingRavager> Dad Legion
[3:08:50] <%shurtal> isn't that how babby is formed?
[3:08:52] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat So I guess Dad died before he could Redshift
[3:08:52] <%kyh9> @42nfl19 she's new rental mommy
[3:08:53] <%king_wragles> Hmm, he DOES have an idle animation
[3:08:53] <+OUTheTeam> failed fusion maybe
[3:08:55] <KaliasTV> Same thing as with Akira I guess, residual memories
[3:08:56] <+twohitgood> maybe he redshifted into an ax legion?
[3:08:56] <Mendin> Cathouse
[3:08:58] <artificiallynatural> His memories went in, like Akira with the arrow
[3:08:59] <Ether101_Prime> Remember they're made of 'DATA'.
[3:08:59] <%hntronium> Where's Akira?
[3:09:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder how Babylon's Fall is going for Platinum
[3:09:06] <$i_am_therydon> his arm is his wife.
[3:09:08] <doggieo> Well Chimeras are people afterall
[3:09:10] <DevinMayCry> They are basically blades from XC2
[3:09:11] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat if you remeber all the other legeons tried to take there previous masters
[3:09:16] <%Sokumotanaka> It seems like all the legion wanted to kill/fuse with their users for some reason
[3:09:17] <+mcjimbo12> Reizie_Etherealm wow i totally forgot about that, is that still happening?
[3:09:17] <Ether101_Prime> So he just put his 'Data' inside of it.
[3:09:23] <Mendin> Arn Legion tried to eat Jin, so I guess Axe fu lly ate Dad
[3:09:24] <worldbrand> @Reizie_Etherealm hopefully well, but i mean it did have a 2019 release date, which uh... isnt happening
[3:09:31] <Ajanimentorofheros> Memories into it like Akira ‘s arrow @angriestpat?
[3:09:33] <hassanico1> MISSILE DRONE, from Automata?
[3:09:37] <DevinMayCry> Jins legion is the only one to literally envelope you though
[3:09:39] <%wydamn> @DevinMayCry I'm willing to bet it will be after the Switch Pro is released. Or as I prefer to call it, the Super Switch. The Switch 64 comes out after that one.

[3:11:17] <%king_wragles> I thought that said he found Tom Hanks for a second
[3:11:17] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The cat nip sitting stance
[3:11:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bagpiping is a new euphemism for jacking off
[3:11:19] <cureneckbeard> emlo
[3:11:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so where do they poop
[3:11:24] <%shurtal> 6 days until Untitled Goose Game
[3:11:28] <Ether101_Prime> I don't like the random loot that's only good for selling.
[3:11:32] <AnDyLV> there doesnt seem to be a litter box on that place
[3:11:35] <SlimeSlimeSlime> ClOnee-Chan
[3:11:38] <%Shonen_hero> oh man this won't be weird

[3:11:40] <%shawntk_> @Sphincter_Spelunker Out the window
[3:11:41] <+heroicspiritavenger> Untitled Groose Game?
[3:11:46] <%ScreamLord> The Bag's purpose it to allow the stomach room the expand when engorged with food
[3:11:47] <cureneckbeard> the baby
[3:11:51] <%king_wragles> Did the Iris voice change?
[3:11:55] <%Dangerous_Mittens> Pat when's the cry stream?
[3:12:05] <%Sokumotanaka> WIKES
[3:12:06] <%wydamn> THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN
[3:12:07] <%NeroInfinite> Pat changed the voice
[3:12:08] <%Sokumotanaka> YIKES
[3:12:12] <%Dangerous_Mittens> 10 hr pat crying stream
[3:12:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ghola
[3:12:17] <Mastigias> oooff
[3:12:20] <%king_wragles> DID NO ONE TEL HER
[3:12:20] <%dekkitout> So about the other clones....
[3:12:21] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nope!
[3:12:21] <%Shonen_hero> NOPE
[3:12:22] <%velemi> SHE DOESNT KNOW SHES A CLONE
[3:12:22] <%Divryne> IT'S FINE SHH.
[3:12:22] <%joylent_blue> nope :
[3:12:24] <beetbo2> NOPE
[3:12:24] <%ThatOneGameTester> probably not
[3:12:24] <%joylent_blue> :)
[3:12:25] <+twohitgood> totally did not tell her she's a clone
[3:12:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> NOPE
[3:12:26] <%Dr_Mooose> well this is awkward
[3:12:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nope
[3:12:27] <%Divryne> YOU CAN BONE HER SAFELY.
[3:12:28] <+HyperCharge_Sam> IT'S FINEEEEEE
[3:12:28] <AwesomeDan_> shes weirdly nonchalant
[3:12:28] <%RantingRavager> Shh probably for the best
[3:12:29] <%ScrubTheNerd> "Something about clones" is kind of an understatement
[3:12:29] <%Ion_Laser> Sounds like NOPE
[3:12:30] <Kongro_> I doubt they told her shes a clone
[3:12:31] <WRFWD> She doesn't know
[3:12:31] <+Darren716> Would you want to tell her?
[3:12:32] <%kyh9> She doesn't remember anything after Chapter 5
[3:12:32] <beetbo2> IT'LL BE FINE
[3:12:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> She doesn;t know she's dead
[3:12:34] <%shurtal> @heroicspiritavenger you play as an asshole goose and you do puzzles taht involve you being an asshole to people
[3:12:34] <Ajanimentorofheros> No, she’s fine!
[3:12:35] <%Shonen_hero> pretty sneaky bro
[3:12:36] <artificiallynatural> considering how the original ended up, it's best not to
[3:12:36] <Lamedhos> too much damage
[3:12:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Last time she knew about the whole story her brain broke.
[3:12:37] <Mastigias> That's dark
[3:12:38] <%Verd_254> SourPls
[3:12:39] <%Sokumotanaka> It's hotter if you dont
[3:12:42] <%NeroInfinite> you told her less than nothing
[3:12:42] <ChaoticDaKiller> DON'T TELL AKIRA SHE'S A CLONE. DON'T TELL MARIE EVERYONE KNOWS SHE'S LAPPY
[3:12:43] <%hntronium> It would probably be bad for her mental health if we did tbh
[3:12:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's anime. People don't talk.
[3:12:43] <%Zombrocom> Yeah go ahead and tell her she's a clone, won't fuck her up at all
[3:12:44] <%king_wragles> Guess what's on the list of major plot points for the sequel?
[3:12:48] <+twohitgood> pat: would you want to know if you were a clone?
[3:12:48] <%kyh9> Check the break room
[3:12:51] <deviljhojho94> that is tremendously fucked
[3:12:51] <+HyperCharge_Sam> She's gunna discover what happened and become Vergil in the next game
[3:12:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sokumotanaka CEASE THIS
[3:12:54] <%Mr_Strut> Shut up, Pat. It's hotter when she thinks the incest is real.
[3:12:57] <Kongro_> You get it from Olivia's cases
[3:12:59] <%corinv> You gotta work for it
[3:13:00] <+Demopoot> @kyh9 After Chapter 10, she wasn't exactly in a condition to "follow" brenda after chapter 5
[3:13:01] <WRFWD> You need to do a few quests
[3:13:01] <%dekkitout> Where's my Dragonator Legion
[3:13:03] <ne0bunny> its in one of the early missions you can do in 12
[3:13:04] <+Darren716> @AngriestPat You get it for doing one of Olives cases
[3:13:05] <DevinMayCry> If you are ever in this situation chat, tell your sister before you know if shes original clone "Yo, hey, I love you sis. Even IF you might be a clone, who knows but if you are promise not to freak out over this k?"
[3:13:06] <%42nfl19> STEAL THAT LAPPY COSTUME
[3:13:06] <%hntronium> You probably unlock it in bloody palace or something
[3:13:07] <seylumiue> Do olive missions
[3:13:07] <DevinMayCry> Works every time
[3:13:08] <beetbo2> @Mr_Strut LUL
[3:13:08] <%Sokumotanaka> @Sphincter_Spelunker XD
[3:13:11] <%corinv> You do it from completing the postgame file R1-B! @AngriestPat
[3:13:12] <glass_marcus> One of the missions gives the raven suit
[3:13:13] <doggieo> LAPPY >>>>>> RAVEN
[3:13:14] <%jeywaii> This police unit is built on Secrets and Lies
[3:13:15] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat You get the raven suit from doing Olivia's Cases. You need to do the ARI missions.
[3:13:16] <TheAzureOracle> @AngriestPat Talk to Olive and do mission R1-B1 for the raven suit
[3:13:17] <PrimeNeverproc> no hermit suit either
[3:13:22] <vVAstrAVv> you have to do like 9 postgame missions for raven suit
[3:13:23] <WRFWD> Unlock a quest in the ARI, beat it, get Raven armor
[3:13:27] <%Keyd00d> in a 3 chapter story
[3:13:27] <%sshen> Cola?
[3:13:29] <worldbrand> uh huh
[3:13:30] <ActualNobody6400> you mean your goddamn lappy costume?

[3:13:45] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat You get the raven suit from doing Olivia's Cases. You need to do the ARI missions
[3:13:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> It wants to eat you
[3:13:47] <DevinMayCry> Lol the anime
[3:13:48] <%supersugoisenpai1> Anime on the news!
[3:13:49] <DevinMayCry> Based off Akira
[3:13:50] <Alfcrad458> \
[3:13:51] <%kyh9> DID YOU SEE IDOL POLICE?!
[3:13:51] <%isolex_> K I L L K I L L
[3:13:51] <Ether101_Prime> What does the vender machine.
[3:13:52] <%NeroInfinite> HA worrry
[3:13:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> uptime
[3:13:53] <zenith0111> LEGIONS ARE 100% STANDS
[3:13:55] <+mcjimbo12> like they're baiting so hard that i'm starting to wonder if this is just expansion/DLC bait
[3:13:57] <%kyh9> DID YOU SEE IDOL POLICE ON THE NEWS
[3:13:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> watch all pf them die in the sequel
[3:13:57] <%dekkitout> Madoka Legica
[3:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> !uptime
[3:14:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 14m.
[3:14:01] <Ajanimentorofheros> K I L L !
[3:14:08] <%mayorrev> Where's Marie
[3:14:09] <ChamoCamouflage> I always imagine that the Legions are less 1-to-1 Slaves, and more actual Pokemons. Is that wrong?
[3:14:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> fuck im super late
[3:14:15] <%hntronium> Did you chat with Brenda and Mitsuru in the clinic?
[3:14:19] <ne0bunny> check the rewards, one will say raven suit
[3:14:21] <%joylent_blue> mcjimbo12 i mean, the director has said he has trilogy ideas
[3:14:22] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Are you aware there are hidden kitties in these missions?
[3:14:25] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat You get the raven suit from doing Olivia's Cases. You need to do the ARI missions.
[3:14:25] <+HyperCharge_Sam> It's super not clear
[3:14:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yoseph IS the gate
[3:14:30] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Pat's seen the twitch comp from a couple hours ago, right?
[3:14:33] <beetbo2> o
[3:14:35] <TheAzureOracle> Shit you have to unlock it
[3:14:36] <%NeroInfinite> Jena and YOseph were both resposnisble
[3:14:45] <+HyperCharge_Sam> You unlock them as you go and they get progressively harder
[3:14:45] <AwesomeDan_> do you only have to do one mission to unlock it?
[3:14:46] <%hntronium> 2 premium codes
[3:14:48] <%Keyd00d> Yeah he saw it
[3:14:49] <%wydamn> This is like the Mario Maker 2 story mode
[3:14:52] <ne0bunny> guess you gotta do a few first
[3:14:53] <WRFWD> Do a few of the first cases, unlock ARI mission, get Raven
[3:14:54] <Kongro_> You unlock more after doing some of these
[3:14:56] <+Darren716> You unlock the one that gives you the Raven suit after you do like 5 or so
[3:14:57] <AwesomeDan_> i got it pretty early
[3:15:03] <%DeathsDoom> More unlock as you go
[3:15:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The reapers are gonna show up and wonder why you're all not dead
[3:15:04] <cureneckbeard> abipopMOE
[3:15:08] <TheAzureOracle> The raven suit mission is R1-B1 but you need to do like 4-5 missions first
[3:15:18] <%Ion_Laser> @doc_ock_rokc Gotta catch the VOD when you can. Especially when Peach shows up
[3:15:23] <%dekkitout> Oh I'm thinkin, alright
[3:15:26] <zenith0111> END GAME GRIND
[3:15:26] <DevinMayCry> I like to think of it as like, playing MGS VR missions after MGS
[3:15:32] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I figured he would have since he was streaming when it was posted, but I wanted to be sure, as it was during the most upsetting moment of this game.
[3:15:39] <%corinv> @AngriestPat Also if you go get the last lappy piece you're missing from file 5, it'll unlock something in file 12
[3:15:46] <%hntronium> God will this ever get off the switch
[3:15:47] <Angry_Ev1L> I loved mgs VR missions
[3:15:49] <ActualNobody6400> This is like how you start missions in Daemon X Machina
[3:15:53] <ne0bunny> go left!
[3:15:54] <DevinMayCry> @hntronium Never ever
[3:16:00] <Kongro_> big never
[3:16:02] <MoulesFritz> imagine not owning a switch
[3:16:02] <%dekkitout> Not in a million years!
[3:16:04] <+heroicspiritavenger> @hntronium No
[3:16:05] <MoulesFritz> do you hate good games?
[3:16:06] <DevinMayCry> @hntronium Maybe a port to a new Nintendo system someday
[3:16:09] <%hntronium> rip
[3:16:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> I'm stuck at one that is kinda bullshitty
[3:16:18] <DevinMayCry> @hntronium Its a nintendo IP
[3:16:19] <%joylent_blue> hntronium only when Mario does LUL
[3:16:22] <Angry_Ev1L> I hate nintendo tho
[3:16:25] <%hntronium> Maybe I'll buy a switch someday
[3:16:29] <%corinv> @ConLin_Arts_ Which one?
[3:16:33] <Angry_Ev1L> for wii U I bought they should give me switch for free Kappa
[3:16:37] <%mister___doctor> I look forward to watching you finish File 12 tonight
[3:16:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @hntronium Stop whining. This is the first time Platinum didn't run out of money, thanks to big Nintendo bucks.
[3:16:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> @hntronium This is a game that nintendo paid for, so probably not.
[3:16:41] <DevinMayCry> Lol maybe someday. Maybe Bayo 3 will make you cave
[3:16:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Bombs and Big Sword dudes and no continues at all
[3:17:09] <%corinv> Oh is it the R3 one that's in zone 09?
[3:17:10] <%mister___doctor> I hope Bayo 3 is more like this structure wise
[3:17:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> I think so
[3:17:22] <%joylent_blue> this and FE3H are what made me finally get a Switch
[3:17:39] <%corinv> Yeah for that I think I just kept it long range when it came to the bombs
[3:17:52] <%Shadicara> Soon Bayonetta will get her Sin DT
[3:17:53] <%corinv> It's not worth going in melee range because there fire hits you for like 1/4 your hp
[3:17:54] <%dekkitout> Isn't Kerbal on the Switch too?
[3:17:57] <%corinv> their*
[3:18:07] <kite1haseo> 4Head just hit them
[3:18:25] <deviljhojho94> How tragic
[3:18:27] <ChaoticDaKiller> Wait until you get to the missions where bosses are treated like regular enemies LUL
[3:18:33] <%Shadicara> *her
[3:18:48] <PrimeNeverproc> no cleanup rate
[3:18:51] <DevinMayCry> Is pats favorite axe now?
[3:19:04] <%Shadicara> Pat's favorite was axe the moment he got him
[3:19:06] <%joylent_blue> Axe has been his favorite since he got it
[3:19:09] <DevinMayCry> I figured it would be
[3:19:19] <%wydamn> @DevinMayCry not sure, but probably
[3:19:25] <%joylent_blue> as it should be, Axe is best
[3:19:38] <%dekkitout> Ah yes, spinning. A good trick
[3:19:58] <%Shadicara> Spin to win
[3:20:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dad Axe is best legion
[3:20:15] <DevinMayCry> Axe is set up from start of game as being the best. Its why you get it last too
[3:20:16] <%hntronium> Oh, isn't 7:30 when Woolie comes on? You gonna raid him Pat?
[3:20:19] <%Shadicara> Axe dad
[3:20:29] <DevinMayCry> Axe Cop
[3:20:41] <DevinMayCry> Wow.
[3:20:43] <deviljhojho94> a raid? crikRat
[3:20:44] <+Darren716> Whats Woolie streaming?
[3:20:45] <DevinMayCry> What is Woolie streaming?
[3:20:46] <Tucker0603> wait, what woolie streaming?
[3:20:48] <%Keyd00d> sekiro

[3:20:58] <%dukenux> i cant see Woolie in my feed
[3:21:00] <%Chichen> Sekiro
[3:21:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Woolie streams most Saturdays
[3:21:01] <Mendin> Ge;s sekiroing
[3:21:01] <%dukenux> so prolly not
[3:21:04] <%Rlexp> apatSmug
[3:21:06] <%joylent_blue> his streams have a slow start, so maybe raid after 15 minutes or so
[3:21:07] <hard_bop_sax_solo> I hope woolie streams Control
[3:21:07] <%NeroInfinite> seikiro
[3:21:07] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you should try and get the lappy costum
[3:21:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lol The twitch clip comments aren't asking why Pat has a Steve Buscemi portrait and Skeleton wearing a cowboy hat. They're all "Ban Alinity for yeeting her cat."
[3:21:12] <stingray53_1> what does waiting for that little flash even do?
[3:21:13] <bear_breaker20> woolie skiro? noice
[3:21:13] <DevinMayCry> No spoilerinos chat for Woolie
[3:21:14] <+Darren716> Speaking of Woolie, Pat when are you making an ad for your shirts?
[3:21:15] <+Frankyzappa> NICE
[3:21:15] <%Keyd00d> perhaps he will finally defeat it
[3:21:18] <Angry_Ev1L> wjere's your raven suit buddy
[3:21:19] <deviljhojho94> The eternal march of sekiro
[3:21:20] <artificiallynatural> has he still not finished sekiro
[3:21:30] <DevinMayCry> I havent either
[3:21:35] <DevinMayCry> Got to final boss and stopped
[3:21:35] <hard_bop_sax_solo> I got stuck on O'Rin and now I gotta relearn everything
[3:21:41] <+Darren716> Also you got a new color for doing that
[3:21:42] <$mooselooseinthehoose> hey pat, how's elmo doing?
[3:21:43] <deviljhojho94> him not finishing sekiro yet has become a bit its fine
[3:21:44] <SlimeSlimeSlime> 70 of 'em, yup.
[3:21:47] <lautalocos> they have a ton of new enemies
[3:21:49] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you can also get the raven costume soon by going through the first few cases
[3:21:50] <+Darren716> Check orders
[3:21:51] <%wydamn> Maybe Sekiro is one of those things that Woolie will eventually Figure Out.
[3:21:53] <%joylent_blue> little bite-sized combat missions :)
[3:21:54] <+HyperCharge_Sam> they were suppose to help you unlock the legion stuff that you already unlocked
[3:21:56] <%dukenux> is Woolie streaming now?
[3:22:07] <%dukenux> YEAH
[3:22:10] <ChaoticDaKiller> okay so the final secret cosmetic was literally JUST found and it's absurd what you have to do to get it
[3:22:13] <%dekkitout> Nice
[3:22:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sick
[3:22:15] <%Ion_Laser> Nice
[3:22:16] <%42nfl19> wait do you slowly unlock more or something? that list seemed small
[3:22:17] <deviljhojho94> i can see it
[3:22:17] <%dukenux> someone on the subreddit posted it
[3:22:17] <+Shotgundam009> SourPls
[3:22:17] <Jontman42> Kinda bums me out that I haven't gone back to Sekiro at all since finishing it
[3:22:18] <%Keyd00d> I don't see it
[3:22:18] <%shurtal> Hey Pat, any interest in streaming Untitled Goose Game? Comes out the 20th.
[3:22:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or that's just how music works?
[3:22:21] <%hntronium> @dukenux 7:30
[3:22:21] <ChaoticDaKiller> it's a whole questline with a sentient robot
[3:22:22] <DevinMayCry> Damn it did do it eventually
[3:22:24] <%corinv> @ChaoticDaKiller Woah really? Can you dm me it
[3:22:27] <%dukenux> @hntronium thank
[3:22:28] <bear_breaker20> i just got back on the sekiro train and great ape is asking for my ticket...
[3:22:30] <%decisivelynameless> Yeah no
[3:22:31] <+Javaa01> It syncs after a couple of steps if you're out of sync at the start
[3:22:32] <%decisivelynameless> You aren't synced up
[3:22:33] <%Keyd00d> Hmmmm
[3:22:34] <%Dangerous_Mittens> Very cool!
[3:22:35] <%corinv> I've been looking forever
[3:22:36] <%dekkitout> Can't be a beat cop if you don't walk to the beat
[3:22:37] <+SamleyTimes> kinda?
[3:22:37] <+Darren716> Check the orders
[3:22:40] <%joylent_blue> i mean, its the same tempo sure
[3:22:46] <%Keyd00d> Still not seeing it
[3:22:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It just boosts you into the rhythm, nice
[3:22:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> What's the running-dog-mascot bottom right with "X"?
[3:22:51] <%dukenux> When you're at a police station, but feel like being on a fashion show catwalk
[3:22:52] <+SamleyTimes> yeah i see it
[3:22:57] <%wydamn> It's more noticable when the bass drum is going
[3:23:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat, music have tempos for a reason.
[3:23:03] <deviljhojho94> cool
[3:23:12] <deviljhojho94> OH SHIT
[3:23:12] <+Darren716> Pretty sure this is a cool one

[3:23:30] <Ipsenscastle> yo
[3:23:30] <%RantingRavager> Worst girl Legion
[3:23:35] <%Keyd00d> 02 doesn't have green though
[3:23:35] <%joylent_blue> i think we know what pat's using from now on
[3:23:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Comatose yogurt spilled legion
[3:23:36] <%Shadicara> HOW CAN THIS BEEEE
[3:23:37] <%wydamn> @HyperCharge_Sam It really shouldn't be surprising, but it kind of is
[3:23:43] <Ajanimentorofheros> Yeah worst girl!
[3:23:45] <DevinMayCry> Best girl is Axe-chan
[3:23:46] <TioXyco> The only thing I hear when I look to that legion is "PASSWORD: THE BEAST!"
[3:23:53] <%NeroInfinite> It's favorite pat
[3:24:03] <%Keyd00d> grace?
[3:24:04] <%Shadicara> Grace
[3:24:06] <+Reizie_Etherealm> GRACE
[3:24:11] <%wydamn> @Ajanimentorofheros be real, you want to be stepped on by worst girl
[3:24:12] <bear_breaker20> greast
[3:24:15] <%VanaSkiller> apatBig grace
[3:24:20] <DevinMayCry> BLUD red
[3:24:21] <worldbrand> that's grape

[3:24:30] <%Shadicara> Pat make AXEsuka chan Kappa
[3:24:37] <+nekodelic> they're not trying to kid anyone tbh
[3:24:40] <HarmlessCrow> Clean your Dad Simulator
[3:24:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It has style and grace, but it doesn't have a funny face
[3:24:51] <%wydamn> @HarmlessCrow LUL
[3:24:54] <%dukenux> "I'm nOt an EVa refErEnCe yOU godDAmn WEeb"

[3:25:04] <plzza_kun> Asuka > Rei
[3:25:06] <%ThatOneGameTester> So the MC is now an Orphan right? surrounded by the ghosts of his family
[3:25:06] <%Shadicara> Good I'm glad it's terrible Kappa
[3:25:11] <Ajanimentorofheros> @wydamn I mean, no. But good try.
[3:25:13] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat make each legion a different Eva
[3:25:20] <TioXyco> now that I look at the silves one, isn't that like.... EVA-03 or 04 color scheme? I remember the PS2 game showing it Silver
[3:25:25] <bear_breaker20> 3D > asuka
[3:25:26] <+Darren716> Some times theyll give you one
[3:25:28] <%Rlexp> apatGib
[3:25:29] <%corinv> They give you a set bunch of items
[3:25:29] <DevinMayCry> As far as I can tell they arent dificulty set too
[3:25:31] <%corinv> For each mission
[3:25:32] <$mooselooseinthehoose> good to hear
[3:25:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The moose is loose
[3:25:33] <%wydamn> @Ajanimentorofheros fair enough, but I gotta check.
[3:25:38] <jubejube56> They give you preset items, sometimes that includes a res boost
[3:25:40] <+Darren716> They give a set of items and its sometimes there
[3:25:44] <+HyperCharge_Sam> if you backtrack sometimes you can get items
[3:26:00] <+Darren716> There are cats sometimes too
[3:26:01] <%Rlexp> I thought you can't keep or bring items into these
[3:26:02] <PrimeNeverproc> can you use resonance boost in police sttion tho?
[3:26:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ...did you have grenades this whole time?
[3:26:07] <ChaoticDaKiller> you think that's crazy? there's 4 cats hidden in file 12
[3:26:08] <%Rlexp> so those drops are soley for the encounter
[3:26:12] <WRFWD> File 12 has 4 cats
[3:26:20] <%corinv> You can't bring items in, they just give you a loadout of items for each missions
[3:26:21] <DevinMayCry> @PrimeNeverproc You could but I bet it resets on mission
[3:26:22] <Festtag> Is that a Maga Hat?
[3:26:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> am i the jerk for wanting this to be on better hardware
[3:26:40] <%dekkitout> Oh lord, it's an Eva 02...
[3:26:40] <%Starlight_Gamer> is there a new game plus for astral chain?
[3:26:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Make Ark Great Again
[3:26:45] <+Darren716> Man the 14 colors look so good in action
[3:26:49] <%NeroInfinite> mpy rvery red hat is a maga hat you dweeb
[3:26:50] <beetbo2> Make Ark Great Again
[3:26:57] <DevinMayCry> @PrimeNeverproc Items can be used in training room so its a waste I think. You can carry your items when redoing old stuff tho is what its for
[3:26:57] <agumon9000> The NG+ is going back to older files with all the legions and fusion
[3:26:57] <%dekkitout> No wait- Gurren Lagann?
[3:26:58] <%joylent_blue> Starlight_Gamer you can redo any mission in the game at any time, so yeah kinda
[3:26:59] <%NeroInfinite> not every*
[3:26:59] <Festtag> There's no NG+ but you can replay every File with everything you unlocked
[3:27:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This game really like using Scudo Angelo as the main enemy type doesn't it
[3:27:14] <DevinMayCry> Its typical NG+
[3:27:17] <DevinMayCry> For these sort of games
[3:27:19] <beetbo2> We asuka bois
[3:27:30] <DevinMayCry> Not really New I guess strictly tho
[3:27:33] <ActualNobody6400> Oh hey he got EVA 02 colors
[3:27:42] <%wydamn> @TimetodiveLTX No, you're not a jerk. My only two game platforms are Switch and PC, and I kind of feel the same way. But being able to play this at the laundromat kind of trumps any performance issues I have with it.
[3:27:49] <DevinMayCry> I love the sync attack on delay with Arrow
[3:28:18] <Festtag> I've felt that way about every game I love on switch. I don't really use the thing on the go so all the switch does for me is low framerates and bad dynamic resolutions.
[3:28:23] <DevinMayCry> On the hardware thing. The games surprisingly good for being 30FPS
[3:28:35] <%wydamn> "This will be a short mission" - Pat, 2019
[3:28:42] <DevinMayCry> Its no 60 but its probably the best action Ive seen on 30 FPS easily
[3:28:50] <SlimeSlimeSlime> So now we have a redhead controlling a red robot. Getting a little Eva up in here.
[3:28:52] <Festtag> Xenoblade 2 struggles so hard in towns, it's sad
[3:29:10] <DevinMayCry> @Festtag Yeah bad texture issues often. Especially handheld
[3:29:14] <$mooselooseinthehoose> Short by astral chain standards
[3:29:44] <DevinMayCry> Pat I rec. turning most the HUD off now that you beat the game
[3:29:46] <Festtag> It's nice being able to keep playing on the toilet tho
[3:29:56] <DevinMayCry> The most important HUD stuff can be seen on your character
[3:30:03] <olliemee> I’ve never seem a 30fps as a bad frame rate, I never notice it
[3:30:06] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat you planning on streaming the LL?
[3:30:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> i get what you're saying, Halo 3 being 30 FPS didn't really effect my enjoyment of it
[3:30:19] <%Chichen> no
[3:30:28] <DevinMayCry> You dont need the HUD anymore. Game looks nice without it.
[3:30:32] <Festtag> You can get used to 30 but it is a big difference
[3:30:36] <olliemee> Astral chain looks and runs very well I’d say
[3:30:39] <Tucker0603> that sounds dumb
[3:30:43] <%TimetodiveLTX> to imply you have big balls
[3:30:49] <%battlebeast67> battlebeast67 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:30:56] <%joylent_blue> not ALL the HUD
[3:30:56] <DevinMayCry> Never die is how you know your health
[3:30:59] <Festtag> Astral Chain drops in peformance hard during some of the investigations
[3:31:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> lol
[3:31:06] <%Monkeyweed21> to show off your HUGENESS
[3:31:07] <%Shadicara> Giving pat way too much credit LUL
[3:31:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Just don't get hit
[3:31:11] <%HRDSalami654> 30FPS isn't bad, but it also isn't great in this day and age.
[3:31:12] <Festtag> Harmony Square's framerate is bad
[3:31:23] <%wydamn> I turned off weapon select and a couple other things on the HUD, but for portable only. Actually pretty cool it's two different sets of options in this game.
[3:31:27] <jubejube56> Are the order for the cases random? I swear I had the raven case available by default
[3:31:31] <%HRDSalami654> I would gladly sacrifice graphical fidelity for frame rate.
[3:31:33] <DevinMayCry> Its pretty is all. I dont blame ya. I think the HUDs customization is worth exploring when you know what all the actions are is all
[3:31:38] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How many cases are there? 8?
[3:31:47] <DevinMayCry> @FirearmsInstructor 71
[3:31:50] <%VanaSkiller> nice
[3:31:51] <doggieo> ITs like Monter hunter with mechs
[3:31:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> WTF?
[3:31:56] <+Darren716> Once you see that you have one that takes place in the ARI do it. Thats the one with Raven Armor
[3:31:57] <ChaoticDaKiller> daemon ex machina basically came out at the worst possible time
[3:31:58] <vVAstrAVv> daemons out?
[3:32:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[3:32:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> there's only two health states, "i got hit" and im gud at the gaem"
[3:32:06] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sounds like something Woolie would do, sawing his legs off for sick cybernetics
[3:32:08] <%MagickBurritoh> it came out yesterday
[3:32:09] <PrimeNeverproc> yup, dt bar totally reset
[3:32:09] <bear_breaker20> 36 hr stream time :)
[3:32:10] <DevinMayCry> @FirearmsInstructor Its basically bloody palace broke up individual parts
[3:32:13] <Festtag> There are actually people now who never heard of Armored Core
[3:32:13] <%Monkeyweed21> would pat lose his dick if it meant he never had to use the bathroom ever again
[3:32:14] <%TimetodiveLTX> "im*
[3:32:22] <+Darren716> It comes up pretty early, i think after you beat the first 8 or so
[3:32:25] <vVAstrAVv> time to buy it lol
[3:32:36] <+Darren716> So then you can rock the edgelord gear the rest of the post game
[3:32:45] <artificiallynatural> Feels bad for DxM. The devs clearly put time in to improve the game as much as they could but it came out between blockbuster titles
[3:33:02] <+nekodelic> don't forget about the cats
[3:33:04] <DevinMayCry> I cant buy DxM because of being laid off. I will buy it though. I should download the demo until then
[3:33:16] <DevinMayCry> I chose AC over it and I dont regret it but I feel bad for them
[3:33:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You intending to 100% all 71? They don't seem super long.
[3:33:22] <%wydamn> Pat, you should probably switch to a non-Asuka skin before Paige asks you why you like Asuka so much.
[3:33:33] <Festtag> I really like the Black Green Gold color for legions
[3:33:33] <+Darren716> DxM would have done so much better if it came out in the first half of the year when there was the switch drought
[3:33:40] <+Darren716> Now its going against giants
[3:33:44] <%joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor i'm sure he is but he said not on stream
[3:33:54] <+Darren716> How do you do that move even?
[3:34:00] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It seems like every other Japanese story about humanity facing extinction is because the World/Universe doesn't want us to advance past a certain point
[3:34:01] <+Darren716> Ive never been able to get it
[3:34:04] <Festtag> back forward attack
[3:34:07] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue Thanks. :) Is this the finale?
[3:34:17] <Festtag> you can do all your special inputs while you ahve arm legion equipped
[3:34:19] <%joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor i believe so
[3:34:19] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[3:34:21] <+Darren716> I try that and i get rocket punch
[3:34:23] <Festtag> also has a special evade attack
[3:34:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Missed 2 chests
[3:34:31] <Festtag> but that was rocket punch
[3:34:36] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[3:34:37] <%VanaSkiller> welcome in frames
[3:34:38] <Festtag> the lasers are the sync attack after that
[3:34:39] <DevinMayCry> Items and red matter dont matter much in these. You can skip em
[3:34:41] <+Darren716> No the missle attach he had
[3:34:54] <DevinMayCry> They matter more for completion sake on actual Files
[3:34:55] <Festtag> hit rocket punch > press L1
[3:35:17] <Festtag> oh wait L1 is not default control scheme
[3:35:33] <+Darren716> I get what you mean, its the sync follow up
[3:36:03] <Festtag> I forgot how to do arm legion's spinny attack, is it perfect call?
[3:36:13] <DevinMayCry> 360 I think
[3:36:23] <Festtag> when I do 360 I always get ora ora
[3:36:28] <stingray53_1> I'm stuck on the raven case so I really wanna se Pat give it a shot
[3:36:30] <DevinMayCry> Oh right you are right that is that
[3:36:53] <%joylent_blue> he'll get there
[3:36:54] <+Darren716> Spinny is 360 X baton attack sync
[3:37:01] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Select the ARI one if it pops up
[3:37:02] <Festtag> that makes sense
[3:37:08] <+Darren716> 360 legion button is ORA
[3:37:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> These "helicopter" designs are fucking cool.
[3:37:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Soster no 17
[3:37:24] <+Darren716> Do you want to mentally scar her
[3:37:26] <seylumiue> Theres a super hard ARI one lol
[3:37:27] <+Darren716> ARI
[3:37:28] <WRFWD> That would probably destroy her sanity
[3:37:31] <DevinMayCry> She can find out when you raid the shores of the west coast and japan next games
[3:37:34] <%joylent_blue> oh boy
[3:37:35] <%dekkitout> YEYEYE
[3:37:37] <karl_rex> Missed the ending, what happend?
[3:37:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Is she even your sister
[3:37:39] <%wydamn> such a cool animation
[3:37:40] <+Darren716> Man its a lot sooner than i remember
[3:37:42] <%Shadicara> BECOME AS REDCOP
[3:37:43] <%Laecerelius> Well when the original sister just thought she might be a clone she really freaked out, so...
[3:37:45] <DevinMayCry> @karl_rex Sequel hooks
[3:37:46] <%joylent_blue> karl_rex stuff
[3:37:53] <+Darren716> karl_rex We beat up Noah and his dumb ark
[3:37:55] <%dekkitout> @karl_rex End of Evangelion, buy happy ending
[3:37:56] <PrimeNeverproc> but no red chain?
[3:37:57] <agumon9000> @karl_rex Yoseph became as god and your sister died but she got replaced by a clone
[3:38:00] <%dekkitout> *but
[3:38:12] <karl_rex> That's messed up
[3:38:14] <Festtag> Fighting Akira at the end felt kinda underserved. They got over their insecurity after act 3, they would never fight you if they werent mindrbokern
[3:38:17] <%Laecerelius> Defeat sisters!
[3:38:22] <Angry_Ev1L> literally REIed your sister...
[3:38:24] <eldragon_1> Rei III doesn't need to know how Rei II died
[3:38:34] <%Monkeyweed21> the commander was REALLY INTO Imoutos
[3:38:37] <KaliasTV> Remember, only one clone remains
[3:38:39] <%Typhaeon> Mirror match
[3:38:40] <%wydamn> @karl_rex Yoseph tried to be God and do human instrumentality and player character stopped him. Also one of the Akira's died and we're not sure it was the original, but we got another that was left behind.
[3:38:45] <Festtag> mindbroken* also I really wanted to see you and him as a fused legion beating up noah with friendship
[3:38:56] <+Darren716> Hey shit yeah, where did these clones come from?
[3:38:58] <Hellarussian> Astral Revengeance
[3:39:01] <bear_breaker20> people really upset theyre bokanovsky twins lol smh
[3:39:04] <agumon9000> Yoseph made them
[3:39:04] <+Darren716> Werent they all absorbed except the one
[3:39:06] <DevinMayCry> Can opener
[3:39:15] <%TheSaintJohn> just do it perfect
[3:39:21] <TheAzureOracle> Oh it's hard now is it?
[3:39:23] <TheAzureOracle> Give it a sec
[3:39:24] <%Piemen99> Do we even know what the ark is? Space ship? Watership?
[3:39:25] <+Darren716> The worst one is the Hermit one, fuck that file
[3:39:29] <%DeathsDoom> wait till you get to the much later cases
[3:39:30] <%wydamn> @Darren716 Don't worry about it too much
[3:39:31] <+Darren716> Because you cant heal
[3:39:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @piemen99 Artificial island
[3:39:49] <Festtag> Also I really wanted to fight giant Noah instead of just dodging him
[3:39:49] <DevinMayCry> Oh yeah cant finish off these
[3:39:54] <%Piemen99> Great thanks
[3:39:55] <stingray53_1> nothing here staggers easily
[3:39:57] <agumon9000> HA
[3:40:01] <agumon9000> You can't finish off ANYTHING
[3:40:04] <agumon9000> in this mission
[3:40:04] <%joylent_blue> they built the Ark in the middle of the ocean so the corruption wouldn't reach them, worked out GREAT
[3:40:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @piemen99 The game literally shows it on a map, in the middle of the Pacific
[3:40:15] <agumon9000> Your healing items and fusion form is all you get
[3:40:23] <Kongro_> There's a wandering NPC in Iceborne with red hair that talks about how she refuses to use any weapons that aren't made with bones.
[3:40:45] <vVAstrAVv> pro tip for when you start getting 15 different shell chimeras pat. arms grab will make them drop their sheilds
[3:41:01] <Festtag> It's weird how they forgot about Fusion Form for the last File.
[3:41:05] <DevinMayCry> @vVAstrAVv Good tip thanks
[3:41:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Kongro_ What a coincidence
[3:41:51] <%hntronium> man
[3:41:54] <Festtag> Akira doesn't fusion, you don't fusion in cutscenes and the clones only fusion when they're about to get absorbed
[3:41:54] <%hntronium> that's a big boy
[3:42:08] <%dekkitout> Ah man, this absolute chad chimera... chadmera
[3:42:09] <stingray53_1> also you can't zandatsu anything here to get health back
[3:42:27] <Festtag> spinny boys
[3:42:30] <%Laecerelius> I think the big guy can be zandatsu'd
[3:42:42] <%joylent_blue> are sync heal abilities viable at all 🤔
[3:42:46] <%floralkami> are they turning chimera every time one dies?
[3:42:47] <vVAstrAVv> yeah im not far into the postgame files but this one was the hardest so far lol
[3:43:08] <+Darren716> One thing about the postgame files, they are stupid easy to S+
[3:43:13] <Kongro_> With Super Armor and auto-sync it was piss easy
[3:43:14] <Festtag> There are sync heals? I thought it's only Energy Heal
[3:43:18] <+Darren716> Im about 40 in and theres like 2 i didnt S+
[3:43:27] <%tragicjohnson84> C9?
[3:43:35] <deviljhojho94> nine C
[3:43:37] <$iaraCatunda> asuka legion????
[3:43:52] <%joylent_blue> there's a health heal upon sync ability, but the ones i've gotten are only like, 0.4% heals lmao
[3:43:52] <%tragicjohnson84> That Legion color is too good
[3:44:01] <$iaraCatunda> Kreygasm
[3:44:09] <Festtag> I like the idea of Axe Legion being all buffs but Crash Bomb is so busted good
[3:44:18] <Festtag> mine does like 400 damage to everythign it hits
[3:44:22] <$iaraCatunda> is there any stand homage legion colors?
[3:44:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Alright
[3:44:24] <vVAstrAVv> my best sync heal is 2% and even with auto sync it doesn't seem super helpfull. course its on sword whos my 2nd weakest so maybe blame sword idk lol
[3:44:26] <%Laecerelius> Yeah!
[3:44:27] <%dekkitout> Cause of the green bits, I call it Gurren Legionn
[3:44:31] <+Darren716> Woo Edgelord time
[3:44:37] <agumon9000> Are you ready for the biggest let down?
[3:44:41] <$iaraCatunda> is there any JoJo reference legion colors
[3:44:46] <%tragicjohnson84> @AngriestPat I just arrived, what rating would you give Astral Chain?
[3:44:47] <Kejang> get dat Lappy Pat
[3:44:48] <worldbrand> I believe it
[3:44:48] <%DeathsDoom> BIG LETDOWNs
[3:44:56] <$iaraCatunda> wait did he beat it already?
[3:45:02] <%joylent_blue> i just wish the Raven Armor didn't have the helmet glued onto it
[3:45:02] <%hntronium> yeah
[3:45:05] <%Laecerelius> And make sure to buy and bring some nice heals
[3:45:07] <%Big_Dream> i stuck on i think mission 51
[3:45:10] <%Monkeyweed21> what about ability codes @AngriestPat ?
[3:45:12] <agumon9000> HA
[3:45:14] <ne0bunny> he didnt even lose a heart
[3:45:18] <%dekkitout> Real Stormrtrooper hours
[3:45:20] <agumon9000> You can't remove the helmet
[3:45:21] <%DeathsDoom> only when summoned
[3:45:21] <%Keyd00d> no pat
[3:45:21] <%joylent_blue> no fuck you

[3:47:36] <%HRDSalami654> Pat has a place in hell.
[3:47:39] <%dekkitout> There can be only one Red Cop
[3:47:41] <%HRDSalami654> It's called a throne.
[3:47:43] <%tragicjohnson84> Does cleaning your Legion do anything in game?
[3:47:49] <AwesomeDan_> The real villain was himself.
[3:47:52] <%BestTeaMaker> if you've done every other lappy quest and bought the head, a case file opens up
[3:47:55] <jaid251> Pat the bloodedge

[3:49:10] <%joylent_blue> GIVE THAT GUY A RAISE
[3:49:17] <%Sokumotanaka> *animal I have become* plays in every legions head

[3:49:35] <tigerfang86> ????
[3:49:35] <vVAstrAVv> cus he dirty i think
[3:49:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It was purple for a second there
[3:49:39] <%dekkitout> They looked purp to me at least
[3:49:41] <%Keyd00d> it's light red
[3:49:41] <agumon9000> Purple
[3:49:42] <+twohitgood> it turned purple briefly
[3:49:43] <deviljhojho94> monkaS
[3:49:43] <WRFWD> They're usually blue or red
[3:49:44] <%joylent_blue> the f
[3:49:44] <%xcompleasedad> PURPLE
[3:49:46] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it was a color filter
[3:49:53] <doggieo> I am become Dad
[3:49:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> :0
[3:49:55] <ne0bunny> its the Max juice
[3:49:56] <PrimeNeverproc> it turned purple
[3:50:03] <AwesomeDan_> you can make your legion hold the camera.
[3:50:03] <bear_breaker20> 'its fucking red"
[3:50:05] <deviljhojho94> Dads are the strongest human race
[3:50:07] <+kraajkase> Eyes are red but the bloom "glow" is kinda purple
[3:50:16] <tigerfang86> STAND DAD
[3:50:19] <%supersugoisenpai1> And the prom's tomorrow
[3:50:19] <Tucker0603> pretty sneaky sis

[3:50:22] <deviljhojho94> i wish my boss would become goo tomatoCool
[3:50:24] <Captain_Aham> AND PROM IS TOMORROW
[3:50:30] <%dekkitout> That sounds like the perfect recipe for JoJo part 9
[3:50:35] <agumon9000> Only Child Pat Howard
[3:50:41] <cureneckbeard> they're blue
[3:50:47] <BioKnight99> so when are the fireworks
[3:50:55] <%Shonen_hero> I wouldn't
[3:50:59] <Tucker0603> that helmet is awesome
[3:51:01] <%Shonen_hero> I'd rock it the entire game
[3:51:04] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat we have dubbed it MAXE Legion now
[3:51:07] <%Ascethetic> maybe we will get a Spear legion in Astral Chain 2
[3:51:08] <ne0bunny> I wish you could remove the helmet
[3:51:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Reminds me of Lancelot from Fate
[3:51:21] <%skizzuto> I wish you could have the helmet/armor but still be able to recolor it.
[3:51:21] <%Sokumotanaka> that's fair
[3:51:24] <PrimeNeverproc> can you put holomask on it?
[3:51:29] <vVAstrAVv> my ff14 character is still in the hw plague doc glam i understand lol
[3:51:29] <%joylent_blue> PrimeNeverproc nah
[3:51:30] <tigerfang86> SOLVE DAT CRIME
[3:51:32] <tigerfang86> DO IT
[3:51:35] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat This game really fucking needed your character to be voiced. Like him remaining silent while your sister gets wrecked like 3 times and your dad dies really is jarring
[3:51:42] <ne0bunny> you are basically now robo-cop from the remake one
[3:51:56] <%joylent_blue> what about BOOK Legion
[3:51:57] <cosmicgoatee> yeah no robo cop is best endgame next to lappy
[3:51:57] <%arancet> GUN legion
[3:52:01] <Angry_Ev1L> ass legion
[3:52:03] <%Sokumotanaka> This is why if I ever made a game I wanted to make a race of armor people walking around
[3:52:08] <%dekkitout> Spear's sync attack could be a dive kick
[3:52:10] <Tucker0603> titty legion
[3:52:13] <tigerfang86> Holy SHIT
[3:52:15] <tigerfang86> HORSE LEGION
[3:52:17] <+Fynale> Spear, Hammer, Shield, Cannon, Mine, Chainsaw, Scythe tons of cool stuff you can do
[3:52:22] <%joylent_blue> HORSE LEGION
[3:52:25] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat have you seen the concept art for the additional legion types, as well as their legion actions? Basically every enemy type has a legion form, and it's awesome.
[3:52:28] <tigerfang86> HORSE LEGIONNNNN
[3:52:31] <%joylent_blue> SHIELD LEGION
[3:52:33] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat what about Hunting Horn legion?
[3:52:34] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Wrashis) (warning)
[3:52:37] <%Sokumotanaka> What about a legion purely made of transport? Moterbike legion
[3:52:40] <ne0bunny> give me a whip legion
[3:52:42] <GobblesInTheMist> @AngriestPat Squid helmet
[3:52:42] <vVAstrAVv> yall wanna see a cool stand look up sandalwood from pyre
[3:52:42] <MoonlightP> wing legion seems like another gimme
[3:52:56] <seylumiue> Ah is this the abberation horde mission
[3:53:05] <agumon9000> Whip, Spear, Horse, and Nunchucks
[3:53:13] <agumon9000> Or like Segmented arms
[3:53:14] <ne0bunny> scythe legion
[3:53:20] <%BestTeaMaker> for example, the Serpent type legion turns into a wieldable weapon, while the Shell type legion gives you a super shield
[3:53:21] <%joylent_blue> Guitar Legion
[3:53:28] <MoonlightP> also next game arm legion should shoot time stop
[3:53:37] <cosmicgoatee> i could see a twin katas legion
[3:53:45] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Guitar Legion sounds rad
[3:53:59] <ne0bunny> spider legion, run on walls and swing on chain, yet legally distinct!
[3:54:15] <MoonlightP> katana legion with iai sword sheathe legion mode
[3:54:27] <%Sokumotanaka> Shield legion like cap style
[3:54:33] <%dekkitout> Looked up the other Legion concept art, the Slime Legion looks like a hoot
[3:54:36] <%Sokumotanaka> Whip legion
[3:54:38] <%titans_ace_jerid> titans_ace_jerid subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[3:54:39] <cosmicgoatee> yes spider legion for traversal sounds sick, web stun and shock multiple enemies
[3:54:56] <seylumiue> Just pit Lappy on a chain and have her do combo
[3:55:00] <+Amaideus> Pat, are you aware you can make a Legion do an attack, swap to a new legion, and continue attacking with the new legion while the first one finishes its command?
[3:55:04] <%joylent_blue> MoonlightP shut UP just name it Vergil Legion
[3:55:22] <%Sokumotanaka> It's like having donald and goofy, without the fuckups
[3:55:31] <MoonlightP> i mean, yeah
[3:55:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think it's at that point where this game is only gonna get better if it has judgment cut end with screen shattering effects
[3:56:05] <%Ascethetic> @Amaideus yes hes aware of hit rush
[3:56:14] <+Amaideus> Doesn't have to be hit rush
[3:56:22] <Blank9> arrow legion is incredible with a focus on crit damage
[3:56:26] <+Amaideus> Hit rush is just the most obvious usage of it
[3:56:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Does this armor only have 2 "battery" resurrections? (Under your health bar / charging bar it says <3: 2/2 . Is that 1/2 of what your Police armor can do?)
[3:56:53] <%joylent_blue> i miss with that attack at least 3/4 of the time
[3:56:55] <%BestTeaMaker> legion command moves can be switched out of without interrupting it?
[3:56:57] <cosmicgoatee> there should be an auto item collector next game all those on the floor seem ridiculous
[3:57:09] <PrimeNeverproc> wanna get me some legion figures/statues
[3:57:09] <stingray53_1> @Amaideus how do you do that?
[3:57:13] <%joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor that's the mission itself setting that restriction
[3:57:14] <+Amaideus> You just switch
[3:57:18] <Blank9> there is an auto item collector ability
[3:57:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Attacks that launches you forward is always hard to hit if you're already next to it
[3:57:25] <+JacktheMan18> Legion Amiibo when
[3:57:29] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat does this fill hole that Revengance 2 would have left?
[3:57:34] <+nekodelic> do you?
[3:57:35] <%Ascethetic> game*
[3:57:47] <%titans_ace_jerid> Get fucked, Boivin.
[3:57:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue Ah ok. I just remember if he got knocked out before it showed 4 hearts. Just noticed the 2.
[3:57:57] <vVAstrAVv> actually yeah lol
[3:58:11] <+JacktheMan18> Oh did I miss the finale of the story?
[3:58:12] <+Amaideus> Do whatever it is you want to do, then swap to a new one midway through. It won't do an entire combo, but if the next input is a long lasting attack or command then it'll stay out until it finishes
[3:58:17] <%HRDSalami654> Knowing Woolie he'll be late. lol
[3:58:21] <%Ascethetic> raiding woolie!
[3:58:22] <vVAstrAVv> you sure did
[3:58:31] <%joylent_blue> yeah the File 12 missions have stricter revives
[3:58:31] <+JacktheMan18> FeelsBadMan
[3:59:03] <%barkon345> @AngriestPat how would you compare the difficulty of this game compared to other platinum Games?
[3:59:17] <%joylent_blue> monkaS
[3:59:19] <stingray53_1> these enhanced enemies are the worst
[3:59:31] <%joylent_blue> its more forgiving i'd say
[3:59:41] <Mythundare> confirmed ez mode for babies
[3:59:46] <%Sokumotanaka> Hey um have any of you every used vats in f:nv and when it gave you a kill cam the bullet wized around the person's head like something messed up it's trajectory? I think I encounters the first ghoul stand user!
[3:59:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> It is a lot more forgiving, you can botch up a lot and still get S+
[3:59:54] <%Ascethetic> i would say its MGR level of difficulty
[4:00:05] <+ConLin_Arts_> heck if you are too good you may only get like B
[4:00:08] <%arancet> its easier only in the sense you get a lot mroe heals and revives, but fighting is still a challenge
[4:00:35] <PrimeNeverproc> gravity ball them
[4:00:54] <%joylent_blue> Sokumotanaka Fortune Ghouls monkaS
[4:01:27] <Buzzard42> yeah it's kinda mandatory in here
[4:01:29] <%Big_Dream> use iris

[4:02:51] <%Razputin217> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[4:03:02] <%superc37> DMC for sure
[4:03:05] <%joylent_blue> uh, DMC5
[4:03:06] <+Amaideus> This is better for normies, DMC5 is better for character action maniacs
[4:03:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> ye
[4:03:22] <TheAzureOracle> Stream is on but he's not "on" on
[4:03:35] <%Sokumotanaka> but is DMC 5 made by plat?
[4:03:47] <%joylent_blue> nah DMC5 is a capcom team
[4:03:48] <TheAzureOracle> No plat is made by DMC
[4:03:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> it's been a good year for CA games! Two top games!
[4:04:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> maybe some hidden that I haven't played yet
[4:04:20] <+Clik404> what if the technological advancements the Astral plain was holding back involved Yoseph’s “instrumentality” thing, and that’s why they dialed back after you killed him? I dunno
[4:04:29] <+Amaideus> 2019's been a pretty good year for gaming in general IMO
[4:04:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> ye
[4:04:55] <%SGrim> That's totally just Zinogre's roar. I love it!
[4:05:05] <+ConLin_Arts_> I need to play some more games from this year
[4:05:13] <cosmicgoatee> @angriestpat if Dante makes it into smash what demon weapons do you want him to have
