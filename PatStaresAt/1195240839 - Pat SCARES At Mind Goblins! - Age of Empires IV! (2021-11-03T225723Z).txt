[0:59:47] <+tussletoes> i don't dream of labor
[0:59:47] <%stickislaw> 4.2 was a great patch.
[0:59:48] <Brandon__Brando> I give to much of a fuck at work
[0:59:48] <%Ziegsy> I just popped shake it off as he said that.
[0:59:49] <Visorak6> I recall our static's war being pretty hype about it
[0:59:49] <CenanRaergo> Machinist is particularly jank at synced level 60. They have two upgraded combo actions and the finisher isn't upgraded.
[0:59:56] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man Shake it Off sucked ass on  4.0
[1:00:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Play Gunbreaker at Thousand Maws Yah
[1:00:06] <%PrimalDweeb> I don't remember what I did 20 minutes ago.
[1:00:07] <%Treuan> @captain_thickthighs Yes but you can start off as a Kung Fu Bunny from the beginning
[1:00:09] <+sanhiei> Warrior is the right call... unga bunga
[1:00:14] <%athuramn> v. ?
[1:00:23] <%Shikari21> 72
[1:00:29] <scrambledxeggz> The only game I've ever played that had to do with jobs was octopath traveler and that ruined me in those games XD

[1:00:31] <%BlackMage66652> @sanhiei GNB is true unga bunga
[1:00:32] <sirtommygunn> I only just got to Heavensward, taking a break from MSQ to level other classes, excited to catch up to current content soon though
[1:00:34] <%Puhff> YUP
[1:00:35] <+NeonxSkies> shake it off used to be a cleanse right?
[1:00:35] <%stickislaw> DRK doesn't have AoE until pretty much 70.
[1:00:43] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt you don't get charge on pld until 72 though Kappa
[1:00:43] <+Grayhammatter> god, yeah, that's terrible
[1:00:48] <%JoshManVGH> Warrior  is still a blast to play at 50
[1:00:49] <Madovir> it fucking sucks
[1:00:50] <Vermillionzetta> I wish I still had my sub online :c Haven't played a concert in Limsa in 8 months
[1:00:56] <%TheEvilOmega> Some of the melee and casters don't get AoE until waaaaay late.
[1:00:56] <akareynolds88> Fell Cleave all day baby
[1:00:58] <%JoshManVGH> PLD eh.
[1:01:00] <Brandon__Brando> that's the new player experience
[1:01:01] <Madovir> it's so depressing to sync down as drk
[1:01:01] <%WhereIsWill> oh yeah thats the worst
[1:01:02] <%TheEvilOmega> Like Scholar.
[1:01:03] <%AHomeschoolDropout> As a PLD main I suggest going PLD for big damage reduction
[1:01:04] <AurusD> PAAAT why is Age of Empires 4 mind goblins
[1:01:05] <%stickislaw> Shake it Off used to be it removed your other mitigation for a shield.
[1:01:06] <%SlackerAlex> but feels bad to not have charge

[1:21:20] <%CheesesSliced> Pat bashing at 120 APM
[1:21:21] <gentlemanboxer> Try rubbing it

[1:23:07] <+trackles_64> so fast
[1:23:08] <+Tetraporc> Age of Wonders is an RTS with actual goblins
[1:23:10] <moonbearbacon> are you playing campaign or skirmish?
[1:23:11] <slix3431> I hate how a lot of the history was side-stepped in III
[1:23:14] <%IronOhki> They literally have farms.
[1:23:15] <scrambledxeggz> yup
[1:23:18] <%IronOhki> I see the farms.
[1:23:19] <%IronOhki> Right there.
[1:23:20] <Shacklebox> heads up the tutorial is really long and super basic don't be afraid to quit and start the campaign
[1:23:21] <%doomunderthestairs> it's updated
[1:23:23] <Coystick> FOOD PLS
[1:23:28] <+Chimeraelite> Now the question is, are the player grunts good. I need my "vulme!"
[1:23:29] <slix3431> AOE III Shit itself at the idea of talking about indian murder
[1:23:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Campaign is amazing
[1:23:34] <+0c310t> I quit the game and never got to see this again!
[1:23:34] <%CheesesSliced> There's a wiki about Pat's mad microing ability
[1:23:36] <Arisato_II> Filthy, unwashed peasants
[1:23:37] <jorniev> AWE
[1:23:38] <Solvari> I hope this is more promising than AoE 3
[1:23:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oh no i already see z-fighting in the village
[1:23:40] <+trackles_64> iam  a pesant
[1:23:40] <Halospaz117> peasent=food, got it
[1:23:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> berry
[1:23:42] <%IronOhki> Warcraft 1 flashbacks, confirmed.
[1:23:46] <Megiddodoge> No, the easiest source of food is your fellow man.  Not fond of this game cowarding out.
[1:23:47] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Is this the Wololololo game?
[1:23:53] <+Rofiarf> the tutorial takes a while
[1:23:54] <Dunmarkh> yeah collect that shit motherfucker
[1:23:55] <RoboticRexkek> food please
[1:23:55] <%BlackMage66652> Mumei?

[1:23:57] <Visorak6> Oh man a game where you can have berry picker memes
[1:23:57] <%IronOhki> Zug Zug.
[1:24:00] <%Sotetsu> I like choke points.
[1:24:02] <jorniev> THIS IS THE WOLOLO GAME
[1:24:02] <+0c310t> Those were poisonous
[1:24:03] <Zombrocom> This is infact, the wololo game
[1:24:03] <ape_hawk> oh no, the berries are all poisonous, you failed the tutorial, the game is now deleted
[1:24:03] <%CheesesSliced> Oh god, this is so exciting
[1:24:04] <%GustauveVIII> hmmm
[1:24:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE FRENCH
[1:24:07] <Coystick> seeing AOE but not with sprites looks weird
[1:24:09] <@Ranryu692> yeyeye Normans
[1:24:10] <+RemedyofRevenge> Somethin need doing?
[1:24:10] <ToneBacas> equating orcs to normans
[1:24:11] <%SWFanatic> norman reedus
[1:24:12] <%shurtal> and the Jeffs
[1:24:13] <RoboticRexkek> Wololo
[1:24:14] <%Valdorick> AGE OF EMPIRES WAS FIRST GOD DAMN IT
[1:24:14] <BliVru> yep
[1:24:14] <jorniev> I AM

[1:24:15] <%BinaryFireball> super
[1:24:15] <%GustauveVIII> pat ever gonna warcraft 3/starcraft?
[1:24:16] <McBubbles07> Normans hmm what race is that
[1:24:16] <+Chimeraelite> or the Norse if you wanna go with Age of Mythology
[1:24:19] <+HefestoForges> yeyeyeyeyeyey
[1:24:19] <%BogBodyPositive> yes
[1:24:20] <%CheesesSliced> CAN YOU HANDLE THE EXCITEMENT?!
[1:24:21] <+Rofiarf> i've been playing it, its a good game.
[1:24:23] <Arisato_II> Instead of the orc it was GENGHIS FKN KHAN
[1:24:23] <%IronOhki> Hey, remember when we used to say "Warcraft" without putting "World of" in front of it?
[1:24:24] <%BinaryFireball> never thought you would stream an rts
[1:24:25] <scrambledxeggz> for the mormons yea
[1:24:28] <Solvari> I see what you mean
[1:24:29] <calboku> sounds like yshtola
[1:24:29] <Jack_of_No_Trades> VERY. Love RTS
[1:24:29] <CruxAustralis> oh hell yeah can't wait to see you get obliterated by mongols :)
[1:24:29] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Whats your APM bro?
[1:24:31] <+trackles_64> 3  was an awful game
[1:24:31] <%Anime_Flux> Hmmm, are you sure?
[1:24:31] <jbrachob> cuz AoE3 SUCKED
[1:24:35] <+0c310t> Kill the babies
[1:24:36] <Dunmarkh> Yeah starve those kids
[1:24:37] <CanadianAdam> so what's the mind goblin to overcome here?
[1:24:37] <RoboticRexkek> so far it's a good mix of old and new
[1:24:37] <fragdar> idk.. the sprites from 2 had a lot more charm imo
[1:24:39] <%CheesesSliced> THIS GAME IS HYPE!
[1:24:39] <RoboticRexkek> imo
[1:24:40] <+Rofiarf> 5 more
[1:24:41] <BliVru> its like Dark Souls 3 compared to 2
[1:24:42] <Zombrocom> This is pretty much AOE2 2
[1:24:45] <+bluescreen1988> just eat dead babies
[1:24:45] <%TheEvilOmega> You need five more.
[1:24:45] <%Sotetsu> This game would be a lot more fun if you just built a city and didn't have to fight. FutureMan
[1:24:48] <+HefestoForges> you did it
[1:24:50] <jorniev> OK but how bad did it suck ?
[1:24:52] <$ItsRatman> QUICK PAT EXPAND TO YOUR NATURAL
[1:24:53] <Zeif00> shahre the wurhke
[1:24:56] <+RemedyofRevenge> SHHHH HAAAH
[1:24:58] <%IronOhki> As the only person on this planet who genuinely loved Brütal Legend, I support this new Pat RTS future.
[1:25:00] <ape_hawk> "produce" villagers
[1:25:00] <$realm_forge> You’re Mormon tho so you can’t make the babies without the sanctified underwear
[1:25:01] <ToneBacas> yay-eh
[1:25:02] <%CheesesSliced> Fuck Deathloop, this is the action I need in my life
[1:25:04] <scrambledxeggz> These kids better be on stakes and not eating them
[1:25:05] <jorniev> IT DOES WORKS
[1:25:06] <Solvari> Pat for Online championship
[1:25:10] <vnzuelandude> they even sound like they did in ao2
[1:25:10] <Dunmarkh> Yeah give birth
[1:25:16] <+trackles_64> Production is  a lot slower
[1:25:19] <%AnthroMetal> what is the name of Pat's fiefdom
[1:25:28] <%Anime_Flux> Everyone talks like Lil Jon. "Yay-eh! OKAY!"
[1:25:28] <+HefestoForges> until you play against someone
[1:25:28] <+Chimeraelite> and the campaigns are fucking great
[1:25:28] <%SWFanatic> work work
[1:25:29] <%NovaKnightmare> Rogan?
[1:25:30] <CruxAustralis> EL NO SABE PepeLaugh
[1:25:31] <Solvari> It's really chill yeah. Always loved the building aspect
[1:25:33] <Zombrocom> At your level maybe
[1:25:34] <%AnthroMetal> Patrapolous?
[1:25:36] <%Logoth_> What's with these old settlers doing the hood "Ye~UH!"
[1:25:37] <%orochiblood> villagio
[1:25:37] <Daxalog> Yeah for now?
[1:25:38] <+Daedalus119> @IronOhki I loved Brutal Legend, though mostly because it reminded me of Sacrifice's gameplay
[1:25:40] <+queaks> plus good sounds
[1:25:40] <jorniev> YE-AH
[1:25:40] <+Rofiarf> i mean, the campaign is not as stressful as multiplayer
[1:25:41] <%SWFanatic> i always found homeworld really relaxing
[1:25:43] <+trackles_64> we learning histroy
[1:25:43] <%CheesesSliced> Subjugate your followers! Hell yeah!
[1:25:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> for now...
[1:25:46] <Zombrocom> High level AOE is hectic as fuck
[1:25:46] <%IronOhki> @AnthroMetal I like this.
[1:25:47] <+butterick> intimate needs
[1:25:48] <arkv01> just farm, expand, and make babies sugoiSchleep
[1:25:49] <RoboticRexkek> even the narrator is chill
[1:25:49] <+Freakgurru> What! Ok! Yeah!
[1:25:50] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @Sotetsu I think in the old games you could set up a skirmish with no enemies and just chill and base build
[1:25:58] <Daxalog> If your having a relaxed and chill time theres something not being done
[1:26:05] <BliVru> @patstaresat In 4 you dont have to micro artillery or ranged units. They work like HIT-SCAN weapons
[1:26:06] <scrambledxeggz> Is this a high functioning sims?
[1:26:09] <%studleydoorite> I'd like to make a mill
[1:26:12] <%barrakuta371> Understandable. As much as I love Homeworld, it's a pretty stressful RTS
[1:26:12] <CruxAustralis> that's standard for RTS
[1:26:14] <+trackles_64> Change the kkeys cause arrows are horrible
[1:26:19] <Zombrocom> I am a fan of grid keys. AOE boomers hate them but that's just because they are used to AOE2
[1:26:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats standard pat
[1:26:21] <ToneBacas> that's fast building
[1:26:22] <$realm_forge> There should be an RTS based off Joe Rogan’s chimpanzee apocalypse scenario
[1:26:24] <+HefestoForges> OH NO he put it far away
[1:26:25] <CruxAustralis> but old RTS usually don't show the keys
[1:26:26] <Shacklebox> works really good for building structures but not units
[1:26:26] <+queaks> Build by timelapse ghosts
[1:26:31] <CruxAustralis> unless you hover over them
[1:26:34] <+trackles_64> get woood pat
[1:26:34] <kurokitten__> that mill placement caused me physcial pain
[1:26:34] <%AnthroMetal> another building for Patrapolous
[1:26:36] <ape_hawk> Wow, this peasant is using the zap system to build the mill
[1:26:36] <+0c310t> No don't use clean energy! Burn some coal!
[1:26:37] <ToneBacas> half the trek
[1:26:40] <CruxAustralis> I still remember the commands to build stuff in AoM
[1:26:41] <Dova573> I had fun with Age of empires Star wars edition
[1:26:42] <arkv01> I've got some wood for you ma'am
[1:26:44] <+RemedyofRevenge> villagers build as quickly as the Amish do
[1:26:47] <%CheesesSliced> IGN gives this 11/10 for graphics
[1:26:48] <%Anime_Flux> They are harvesting the HELL out of that bush
[1:26:49] <Arisato_II> They kept the old AoE2 shortcuts with a new UI which is weird but it works
[1:26:51] <Dunmarkh> Yeah get that wood
[1:27:02] <%CheesesSliced> It's so retro seeing games in 2k again
[1:27:04] <%tanarath> homeworld requires savescumming to do it well
[1:27:06] <arkv01> tiny axe, big builds
[1:27:09] <Dr_Mooose> look at him go
[1:27:09] <+cermo55> that's a decent sized axe
[1:27:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> wow this looks awful
[1:27:12] <$Invlux> Werk werk
[1:27:13] <Kaji04> why is he not smashing rocks tho
[1:27:14] <RoboticRexkek> Hope the map editor is as good (if not better) than AoEII
[1:27:14] <Solvari> Oh boi here come the warrior mains
[1:27:19] <+trackles_64> Now get all the wood on the map
[1:27:19] <%BinaryFireball> lumber camp me boiii
[1:27:19] <Zombrocom> What, you think he was gonna cut wood with his hands?
[1:27:31] <%CheesesSliced> THIS IS SO METAL!
[1:27:33] <%IronOhki> @Invlux Whaaaaaaat?
[1:27:34] <@Ranryu692> that's so fast
[1:27:35] <+RyTYoung> Pat do Big Daddy cheat nao and hope to god it works
[1:27:35] <@Ranryu692> that's too fast
[1:27:36] <%crimsonharvest> This is why I love Rimworld, mass combat just doesn't interest me
[1:27:49] <+Rofiarf> why not just leave like 2 on the food?
[1:27:50] <%ShogunNoonto> Wait so are the stronghold crusader games just to rip off of this
[1:27:52] <+HefestoForges> rip tree
[1:27:53] <Dunmarkh> Deforestation time PogChamp
[1:27:54] <Arisato_II> Mass murder nature yeah
[1:27:56] <%depressed_skeleton> Put tree into Trash
[1:27:57] <%Sotetsu> Is this mind goblin specific to this game, or is it all RTS games?
[1:27:58] <Visorak6> Careful pat the elves are going to come for you
[1:27:59] <CruxAustralis> like ants on a piece of meat
[1:27:59] <$Invlux> When you and the homies get reassigned to lumberjack duty
[1:28:01] <Halospaz117> Good god this tree is getting MURDERED
[1:28:04] <mihokspawn> Vololo! How is everyone :D
[1:28:05] <+Rofiarf> fair
[1:28:05] <%Anime_Flux> LUL

[1:28:48] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat you can erect faster with more helpers
[1:28:53] <%IronOhki> @CheesesSliced Trees are made of wood, which is the worst thing you can get from a dumpster.
[1:28:57] <dukenux> lumbah
[1:29:06] <%CheesesSliced> THEY DON'T NEED TO TRAVEL FAR ANYMORE!
[1:29:08] <+0c310t> Are the rumors true? Is Baiken coming to GG:Strive?
[1:29:13] <CenanRaergo> You have researched...DEMOCRACY.
[1:29:16] <%Monkeyweed21> barracks
[1:29:20] <%Anime_Flux> These villagers are some chatty Cathies
[1:29:26] <Shacklebox> i love the first five minutes of AOE4 because you're just watching your little scout

[1:29:39] <+0c310t> @CenanRaergo That's never happened.
[1:29:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @0c310t baiken rumors are totally unreliable until you actually see baiken
[1:29:48] <Klarrann3> putting houses right next to the center NotLikeThis
[1:29:51] <%TheEvilOmega> Gotta build some farms.
[1:29:54] <Shacklebox> as you get along further in the ages the villagers and units speak more modern languages
[1:29:55] <%SirGO0SE> sometimes when watching RTS games I just *hear* the WC2 battle music
[1:29:57] <%TheEvilOmega> And then construct additional pylons.
[1:29:57] <jorniev> is this really a goblins game if it has anti goblins things? or just baby steps for now
[1:29:59] <%CheesesSliced> When do the Protos attack?
[1:30:02] <Shacklebox> it's pretty sick
[1:30:02] <%IronOhki> The British hate Rs.
[1:30:09] <+Rofiarf> yeah my boy
[1:30:10] <dukenux> Block the entry to your fortress with a peasants house, genius
[1:30:11] <%Forbidden_Karp> madness

[1:30:26] <%Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! Happy 32 months! SO as long as the food is wrapped in plastic, isn't expired, and can be cleaned if it does have contamination on it (i.e yogurt cups, milks, etc.) then it's good to go! Source: I've worked with food orgs that do this to feed homeless.
[1:30:27] <+Freakgurru> Then everything Changed when the Fire Nation Attacked
[1:30:30] <Dova573> NEED MORE PYLONS
[1:30:32] <%NovaKnightmare> Make morevillager
[1:30:32] <%BinaryFireball> chop chop motherfucker
[1:30:33] <kurokitten__> Pat if you click directly on the mill it will automatically place the farms around it
[1:30:35] <%Forbidden_Karp> ah, the luxury of the farm being the same size as the mill...
[1:30:35] <scrambledxeggz> Pat just wanted a square XD
[1:30:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nutrient cube
[1:30:58] <%IronOhki> One square of food, located quite distant from the dumpster.
[1:31:00] <Necnill> mind goblin kept at bay
[1:31:04] <MrDemsus> its an optimal mill!
[1:31:05] <%CheesesSliced> "Gimme more wood" - Pat Boivin

[1:31:25] <$ItsRatman> They made it so mills and farms are the same size? thank god
[1:31:31] <dukenux> Ahh
[1:31:32] <%Anime_Flux> This narrator reminds me of those educational slide-shows back in school. Like with a projector and you change the slide when it beeps...
[1:31:36] <Solvari> according to reviews this seems to be better than AoE 2 and 3, intriguing but still not sure about the price
[1:31:39] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[1:31:40] <Zombrocom> I love the little fences and terrain buildings get around the,
[1:31:40] <luftraumm1> it's a shame stronghold died

[1:32:24] <+Shaggnar> Gotta pump those foods
[1:32:26] <Kaji04> That's many a food
[1:32:29] <Solvari> @luftraumm1 man I recently tried out Warlords, how could they fall from crusaders and stroghold 2 FeelsBadMan
[1:32:29] <%TheEvilOmega> Don't forget that you have to keep rebuilding farms.
[1:32:39] <scrambledxeggz> How do you keep track of everything after a certain point of mass production?
[1:32:40] <dukenux> yayah

[1:32:46] <%CheesesSliced> HE FOUND THE GOLD, YOU GUYS!
[1:32:46] <Zombrocom> No you don't need to rebuild farms in 4
[1:32:48] <MrDemsus> @fuji_n2 it also has alot of live action movies, and movies about medival tech that you get from campaign missions
[1:32:49] <%tank7013> That is approximately one amount of foof
[1:32:52] <+HefestoForges> my ocd is tingling

[1:34:03] <cthulu_fearlock> @patstaresat you can keep the scout moving for a while with a click on the minimap
[1:34:06] <%NovaKnightmare> Make the villagers eat each other
[1:34:07] <olm46> Human rights are a drain on our resources.
[1:34:09] <%BlackMage66652> Subjugate the natives in the name of Jesus!

[1:34:12] <warlish> you dont have to worry about it in the first few campaign missions
[1:34:19] <Zombrocom> The peasants minimum wage is their continued existence
[1:34:20] <oda_flobunaga> Its almost like Dune would make a really good RTS, maybe even 3 of them...
[1:34:26] <Parapattern> Or chop off a hand
[1:34:28] <fuji_n2> so.... when does the crypto age starts? Kappa

[1:36:06] <Shacklebox> that's the buff radious, if enemies get close it buffs everyone in the circle
[1:36:06] <fuji_n2> man I hope age 4 sells well and they can make age 3 LUL @cruxaustralis
[1:36:06] <%BlackMage66652> Can this game take us back in time to prevent Quebecois from existing?

[1:37:05] <Zombrocom> You need like, 5 more barracks
[1:37:06] <CruxAustralis> I forget that AoM Titans is an expac not a
[1:37:08] <%IronOhki> Battle battle battle.
[1:37:10] <CruxAustralis> not a 2*
[1:37:20] <%Forbidden_Karp> Theoretically all resources are infinite through use of the market

[1:37:30] <%SWFanatic> zug zug
[1:37:31] <Treasure_Vault> It's crazy how a spear is usually the best weapon around for most of history
[1:37:35] <fragdar> i could never be a decent players in AoE cuz i NEED to make my base look good, and not effective
[1:37:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @CruxAustralis it got a Chinese expac somewhat recently, but I heard it kind of sucks
[1:37:36] <%TheEvilOmega> Oh. You're good.
[1:37:41] <%SirGO0SE> and I says to him, thats no spear mans, thats my wife!
[1:37:44] <%SWFanatic> I can see my house. I wish I had a weapon.

[1:40:00] <%crimsonharvest> horses really aren't any match for polearms
[1:40:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> spears are notoriously effective vs cavalry tbh
[1:40:08] <%solracc25> oh no, fog of war
[1:40:09] <%Anime_Flux> rekt

[1:40:36] <ape_hawk> but if the invaders were all defeated... why burn the stables?
[1:40:38] <%solracc25> a dude died
[1:40:42] <%Forbidden_Karp> I mean they weren't really invading so much as living there peacefully

[1:42:17] <%SirGO0SE> f r i e n d l y :)
[1:42:17] <LiL_Drummer2552> It's just like here in Atlanta, Georgia. The city burned down so they built a new one on top of it.
[1:42:18] <%SharkMissile> Wait that's your crops
[1:42:18] <scrumbotime> why are they burning the wheat
[1:42:22] <StarlingSilence> the horses start throwing torches as well

[1:43:29] <%MightyDuckShoes> Pat doesn't know about the sort tech?
[1:43:33] <jorniev> I think this was in 2
[1:43:34] <scrambledxeggz> Commander Gief
[1:43:35] <%Anime_Flux> Damn, you're a regiment now
[1:43:40] <%AncelDeLambert> "the horsies"
[1:43:41] <+Exicuren> Ah nice
[1:43:42] <scrumbotime> That's..... pretty cool
[1:43:43] <%SharkMissile> @jorniev I said to defeat their CORPS!!!
[1:43:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> that's been around for like 15 years
[1:43:45] <General_Terro> thats great
[1:43:46] <%SWFanatic> They broke new ground
[1:43:49] <%Forbidden_Karp> wow I haven't seen anyone else pick up on that
[1:43:49] <+Grayhammatter> the horsies
[1:43:50] <%MightyDuckShoes> This is Reverse-Goblins
[1:43:50] <jorniev> oh no its better than in 2
[1:43:51] <+Exicuren> Better than 3 actually
[1:43:54] <ShineTheDiamond> Neat
[1:43:57] <CruxAustralis> you could always do that kinda lmao
[1:43:59] <ToneBacas> years in the making tech
[1:44:00] <Solvari> LUL well that was long ago
[1:44:01] <%Cecrios> I can't wait for you to see control grouping
[1:44:01] <jorniev> @SharkMissile LUL
[1:44:02] <%TheEvilOmega> Star Craft 2 had the ability to control click on a unit type.
[1:44:03] <%SirGO0SE> but control groups
[1:44:03] <%Axellogic> Did you know that graphics
[1:44:04] <%depressed_skeleton> the persona 5 of Age of Empires
[1:44:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:44:05] <olm46> Might?
[1:44:07] <SaltyAzteca> Was that a RLM ref
[1:44:09] <%SWFanatic> Not since Pac Man has a game innovated so much
[1:44:09] <General_Terro> well he is a dog
[1:44:12] <scrambledxeggz> I love him
[1:44:13] <%solracc25> HobGoblin defeated

[1:44:15] <General_Terro> LUL
[1:44:17] <T_Sasquatch> you think ?
[1:44:17] <CruxAustralis> that's why you had control groups
[1:44:17] <thelonechris> LUL 󠀀
[1:44:18] <ShineTheDiamond> Poor pupper!!!
[1:44:19] <Skatedeandre> he is a dog

[1:44:25] <ShineTheDiamond> lul
[1:44:25] <%bear_breaker20> the agony
[1:44:26] <Arisato_II> He's trying, okay?
[1:44:28] <Solvari> LUL you did name him Zangief
[1:44:29] <+Grayhammatter> he is a dog
[1:44:32] <scrumbotime> he's leading himself around
[1:44:33] <JetpackMcQuack> infinite fetch
[1:44:37] <+Grayhammatter> he's trying his best
[1:44:39] <+Exicuren> That's dog standard
[1:44:40] <+RelikaNox> He's doing his best
[1:44:48] <jorniev> HARASS THOSE SLOW POKES
[1:44:57] <kurokitten__> you reassign the control group
[1:44:57] <+SilverDevilfish> Yeaaah
[1:45:01] <%SirGO0SE> i havent played this but id assume override it with a new one
[1:45:02] <%depressed_skeleton> alt f4.
[1:45:02] <+Rofiarf> make a new one over it?
[1:45:02] <BliVru> separate the units and control group them again
[1:45:03] <Shacklebox> u can't, only overwrite
[1:45:06] <+Rofiarf> no idea
[1:45:07] <@commanderclaw> IIRC there's a learn to play tutorial
[1:45:07] <%vivaldiva> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:45:09] <kurokitten__> you can't remover it only reassign
[1:45:10] <sirtommygunn> replace it with another control group
[1:45:10] <Arisato_II> Ctrl + the number you want to remove
[1:45:13] <Mattais88> Delete?
[1:45:14] <sirtommygunn> otherwise, don't
[1:45:15] <Shacklebox> YOU CAN'T
[1:45:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> push button
[1:45:18] <Explodincatz> u cant remove only overwrite
[1:45:18] <Solvari> goblin fodder LUL
[1:45:22] <Shacklebox> the goblins arrive
[1:45:28] <+Rofiarf> double click selects all of a same unit
[1:45:28] <%Anime_Flux> another day of drills
[1:45:36] <%MightyDuckShoes> "-such as archers." That seems pretty specif- ELIMINATE ENEMY ARFCHERS!
[1:45:36] <+Exicuren> Select the horses and press CTRL + 1?
[1:45:43] <%Anime_Flux> Now... FLYING V!
[1:45:43] <%BinaryFireball> yup
[1:45:45] <+Rofiarf> yes
[1:45:46] <BliVru> Uyeap
[1:45:47] <%SirGO0SE> thats a nice touch
[1:45:47] <%Cecrios> Yup yup
[1:45:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[1:45:48] <+Exicuren> Ah, yes
[1:45:48] <$ItsRatman> They sure are
[1:45:49] <@Ranryu692> makes sense
[1:45:50] <%linSP> there has to be a better way
[1:45:50] <Shacklebox> YES
[1:45:51] <CruxAustralis> should be yeah
[1:45:51] <Dunmarkh> It's like kenshi
[1:45:52] <Solvari> same in AOE 2
[1:45:52] <fuji_n2> yu
[1:45:52] <Dr_Mooose> huh neat
[1:45:53] <Arisato_II> Yes because you need to keep formation
[1:45:53] <%SirGO0SE> formation PogChamp
[1:45:54] <%MightyDuckShoes> Formation
[1:45:54] <ToneBacas> so they arrive at the same time
[1:45:55] <Zombrocom> Well yes
[1:45:56] <oda_flobunaga> That is old oooooooolllllllldddddd tech
[1:45:57] <+Rofiarf> they stop in battle
[1:46:01] <%BinaryFireball> its good and bad
[1:46:05] <Halospaz117> that tends to be general RTS fair
[1:46:06] <+Exicuren> If you choose the horses only, they move at their own speed
[1:46:07] <luftraumm1> warcraft 3 introduced that feature
[1:46:11] <Explodincatz> there should be a toggle for that like wc3 had
[1:46:11] <ToneBacas> time to wreck some shit
[1:46:13] <%Anime_Flux> Suck it, Red!
[1:46:17] <%linSP> fuck them red guys
[1:46:21] <%IronOhki> BLITZ
[1:46:30] <%SWFanatic> Fire is hot
[1:46:30] <SmortyPuffin> some pretty long sticks
[1:46:31] <+Exicuren> Only when attacking is when they have theor own speed
[1:46:31] <JetpackMcQuack> poke them
[1:46:31] <Saltmeisterr> get fucked red
[1:46:32] <%Forbidden_Karp> More enemy wheat!
[1:46:32] <Zombrocom> Archers HATE horses
[1:46:32] <ToneBacas> that last guy got it bad
[1:46:37] <%Anime_Flux> Better DEAD than RED!!
[1:46:39] <%IronOhki> Wrong color!
[1:46:40] <%IronOhki> Wait
[1:46:40] <+takotoots> brutal
[1:46:44] <jorniev> *MY LITTLE DARK AGE PLAYS*
[1:46:44] <%IronOhki> Hang on.
[1:46:51] <Halospaz117> This is what they get for building one unit type per town
[1:46:51] <Mattais88> I really miss RTS's
[1:46:52] <+Exicuren> Burn and kill them all
[1:46:54] <AngryAsian5> MURDER AND PILLAGE
[1:47:06] <+Exicuren> WE ARE THE HEROES OF THE STORY
[1:47:11] <Zombrocom> KILL MAIM BURN. Ahem. Sorry.
[1:47:13] <%SWFanatic> Not since Dune II has a game innovated as much as Pac Man
[1:47:14] <calboku> BURNINATING THE VILLAGE!
[1:47:14] <+Exicuren> BURN IT ALL
[1:47:16] <$ItsRatman> Aw yiss Longbowmen
[1:47:32] <%Cecrios> AoE is really just a game about making your people happy :)
[1:47:33] <+Exicuren> lmao
[1:47:34] <olm46> "Friendly villagers". Traitors, you mean.
[1:47:39] <AngryAsian5> MADLAD
[1:47:40] <@Ranryu692> Madness
[1:47:42] <Arisato_II> Aren't you a rebel
[1:47:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what a go getter
[1:47:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's crazy
[1:47:47] <ToneBacas> is this tutorial narration like a history channel dramatization?
[1:47:54] <%BinaryFireball> make your people happy by murdering those other people
[1:47:54] <%MightyDuckShoes> See them driven before you
[1:47:55] <%BinaryFireball> yaaaa
[1:47:57] <scrambledxeggz> This feels like a phone game when I look at it but it plays better you know?
[1:48:05] <%SirGO0SE> sounds like the start of an archery isekai
[1:48:06] <%SWFanatic> psaGiefrail psaMenace
[1:48:12] <Jontman42> infinite archers
[1:48:15] <kurokitten__> @ToneBacas yeah, the campaign is straight up framed as a historical documentary
[1:48:20] <%BinaryFireball> best thing ever is you can control group buildings
[1:48:31] <%BinaryFireball> yuuup
[1:48:36] <%BinaryFireball> and you can just hit that button
[1:48:42] <+Exicuren> That's old tech
[1:48:42] <%SirGO0SE> gotta build fast
[1:48:43] <+Rofiarf> shift adds 5 at a time to build q
[1:48:44] <Explodincatz> always could
[1:48:45] <%BinaryFireball> they queue evenly
[1:48:46] <ToneBacas> LUL stop
[1:48:50] <Jontman42> I think that's more than 20
[1:48:50] <+D00msDayDan> supcom has control group buildings too
[1:48:51] <+Rofiarf> you need more food
[1:48:54] <AngryAsian5> Your arrows will blot out the sun
[1:48:55] <%MightyDuckShoes> FUUUUCK I'm getting this game. I can't not. Its been so long since 2 and Galactic Battleground
[1:48:56] <kurokitten__> also double-tapping a control group button moves your camera to the group
[1:48:59] <%IronOhki> @Exicuren Pat hasn't touched the genre in that long.
[1:48:59] <%Cecrios> Mind E X P A N D
[1:49:02] <%notsoy> most RTSs have been able to do this for a while now
[1:49:02] <Zombrocom> Spam those OP longbowmen
[1:49:02] <Explodincatz> thats literally Warcraft 2 tech
[1:49:03] <%Monkeyweed21> need more food
[1:49:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> watching you discover all this old tech is hilarious
[1:49:07] <vnzuelandude> Pat Needs Food Badly
[1:49:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> What was the last RTS pat played?
[1:49:11] <Arisato_II> 15 units it's the max production queue per building
[1:49:12] <blackened61986> You could control group buildings in Warcraft 3.
[1:49:12] <%SirGO0SE> love doing that and setting the waypoint directly in enemy territory LUL
[1:49:13] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> OMG I thought he crashed the stream/ his computer LUL
[1:49:18] <scrambledxeggz> Make it rain fire!
[1:49:19] <Arisato_II> 15 x 4 = a lot, I don't know math
[1:49:20] <%BinaryFireball> probably sc2
[1:49:22] <kurokitten__> Also you can select multiple different types of buildings and then tab throught them!
[1:49:25] <Shacklebox> control group buildings is fuckier, try putting the stable on the control group with archery ranges
[1:49:25] <%SWFanatic> Not since scrounging in trash for food had such a monumental moment been born
[1:49:34] <kurokitten__> I like to just assign all my military buildings to one control group
[1:49:35] <%IronOhki> @vnzuelandude "Ginger Orb Needs Food Badly"
[1:49:37] <oda_flobunaga> @ThomasOfTroy Total Warhammer 2
[1:49:37] <BliVru> U can shift control to add units to control group
[1:49:38] <%BinaryFireball> thats a shit ton of archers lol
[1:49:39] <ToneBacas> that takes care of a lot of clicking you would have to do otherwise
[1:49:43] <Fear_Ranjer> The snowballing BEGINS
[1:49:52] <jorniev> this just seems like he is just feeding the goblins
[1:50:07] <%IronOhki> Can you feed this many mans?
[1:50:11] <%TheEvilOmega> You need more wood, Pat.
[1:50:14] <%BinaryFireball> the best part about RTS's are all the sounds
[1:50:18] <%athuramn> ikr @jorniev
[1:50:20] <%athuramn> LUL
[1:50:28] <kurokitten__> Shift + Number will add units to an existing control group Pat!
[1:50:29] <%IronOhki> @jorniev I'm thinking this too.
[1:50:33] <cherryburnout> weren't alot of the features pats enjoying in aoe2?
[1:50:38] <kurokitten__> you don't need to reselect the whole thing
[1:50:39] <Parapattern> I love loud noise
[1:50:43] <%Anime_Flux> I uh... I hope your home town is doing okay...

[1:50:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I imagine the Time Pressure goblin won’t be running rampant in the tutorial
[1:50:49] <%SirGO0SE> this does look really really good and my rts itch needs a hell of a scratch
[1:50:51] <Saltmeisterr> chat where is the wololo?
[1:50:53] <%BinaryFireball> @cherryburnout maybe lol
[1:50:57] <Saltmeisterr> i was promised wololo
[1:50:58] <Shwepie> @cherryburnout Shh, don't spoil his fun. :)
[1:51:08] <%BinaryFireball> aoe2 de made things real nice
[1:51:09] <%twistedj3ster> That's part of how he's curing them, he's actively facing the goblins
[1:51:16] <scrambledxeggz> Dont make me call the bois
[1:51:19] <+Rofiarf> click and drag the rmb to make them face a direction
[1:51:21] <cherryburnout> if pats like aoe it's a win for everyone
[1:51:28] <%SWFanatic> deploy siege tank for extra range
[1:51:30] <+Exicuren> Ah, this is important, yes, do they work like real archers, or they have shotgun range, only
[1:51:34] <Arisato_II> Hold right click and drag towards the direction you want them to look at
[1:51:39] <AngryAsian5> MURDERRRRR
[1:51:42] <kurokitten__> >Charging horsemen into spearmen
[1:51:42] <Visorak6> Man those arrows do not look good

[2:31:44] <%TheEvilOmega> Did you just block your people from getting out?
[2:31:54] <Profmcstevie> RTS in 2021, feels good
[2:31:55] <r0termond> You win by buildin walls against the aztec empire KEKW
[2:31:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> Most of these are standard features
[2:31:55] <Landedx> and one of the villagers is trapped outside
[2:31:55] <$scallycap> theyve been doing this for 22 years
[2:31:56] <@commanderclaw> Make a gate

[2:32:10] <slix3431> You were right
[2:32:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I like how the Trees make army passage impossible still
[2:32:15] <akitanito> gate's not aligned to the road, my OCD is triggered
[2:32:18] <%SWFanatic> bork

[2:32:53] <+chiazam> This is the most chill goblin stream I’ve seen so far

[2:33:02] <scrambledxeggz> Hopefully the range wont get nerfed because that was huge
[2:33:05] <%PrimalDweeb> How dare that gate not aline perfectly with the road.

[2:41:49] <joniroquai> 30) Wololo
[2:41:54] <%TheEvilOmega> You need about 80 more units, Pat.
[2:42:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Mon Dieu
[2:42:07] <%SWFanatic> bien
[2:42:15] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Before you complete the final objective, Completely depopulate the map of all resources. In AOE2 you could find things like spawn points for popup enemies like the Danes back there also it is satisfying
[2:42:18] <rReizs> more horses to scuttle
[2:42:22] <JayEarly> @theevilomega it would be very rude
[2:42:26] <slix3431> Sheep must survive
[2:42:42] <%TheEvilOmega> You must ALWAYS crush the AI with overwhelming might.
[2:42:49] <%skeletonmilk> horse semens
[2:42:53] <Gorgs7> no archers?
[2:42:53] <slix3431> Who else is invested in sheep making it to final episode?
[2:42:54] <+Grayhammatter> horsie time
[2:42:58] <r0termond> Man i hope they consider making this shit for consoles too
[2:43:07] <rosysyntax> @slix3431 i pray for sheep
[2:43:12] <%TheEvilOmega> In AoE 1 I would destroy them down to just their city center, then build a giant force and crush it in seconds.
[2:43:12] <%SWFanatic> sacre bleut, jean-pierre has no time to butter his baguette!
[2:43:23] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt archers?
[2:43:26] <JayEarly> you have to spend more time than you need to absolutely rub the AI into the dirt
[2:44:00] <Gorgs7> fair enough
[2:44:02] <%SWFanatic> psaGoblin psaFist
[2:44:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 116/200 those are rookie numbers

[2:44:13] <SeeAndShudder> but HE WAS WRONG
[2:44:20] <+darkco3d> Arch isop
[2:44:21] <%MugenSandan> I wonder if people looked at Archers back then the way we look at GUN now
[2:44:28] <%Bluwizard21> I always loved clearing out the map  and finding the hidden enemies that kept them from instantly losing until they could spawn from the triggers
[2:45:18] <JayEarly> who cares about archers or infantry when you can have a gloriously wasteful massed cavalry charge
[2:45:26] <+trackles_64> I hope they do  a sequel to Rise of Nations
[2:45:34] <dreadedcthulhu> is the blacksmith the sword dentist
[2:45:39] <%TheEvilOmega> Build multiple of the technology buildings to research multiple technologies.

[2:46:22] <+darkco3d> SeemsGood
[2:46:22] <FassieFons> good fight, guys
[2:46:23] <%tanarath> I'm wondering if we'll see heavy cavalry.
[2:46:31] <%SWFanatic> AI: I know...we'll attack that giant group of enemy troops
[2:46:35] <%Bluwizard21> I wish they had added target priorities so that horses would run after the archers rather than facefuck pikemen
[2:46:35] <joniroquai> 21) Nice town, I'll take it
[2:46:37] <r0termond> they are a little outnumbered
[2:46:48] <akitanito> but have you built enough pylons

[2:47:58] <+trackles_64> You built an army way bigger than needed
[2:47:58] <%TheEvilOmega> Oh, pat. Pro tip! You can queue units being built to go to a unit in your army and follow them so they can catch up to the rest of your forces.

[3:19:50] <%SWFanatic> zoom enhance
[3:19:53] <ColRedyx> You're only selecting one idle when you click the button.  Can you ctrl or alt click to select all?
[3:20:01] <FullMetalSnorlax> this game is missing the modern "idle worker" button
[3:20:18] <+trackles_64> pat you have way to many resources
[3:20:18] <FullMetalSnorlax> oh there it is
[3:20:19] <rosysyntax> whaaaaat weird
[3:20:38] <%notsoy> you would have to click them on the actual game map, not the buttons from the UI
[3:20:41] <ColRedyx> Can you set the rally point to your leader?
[3:20:47] <$scallycap> Pats doing it right, when your economy is good just spend spend spend
[3:21:01] <MrATheGreat> you can probabl yyupgrade and build units at the same time
[3:21:05] <Dr_Mooose> fair
[3:21:11] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt might want some villagers on gold...
[3:21:18] <joniroquai> 42) Give me your extra resources

[3:23:05] <ColRedyx> Ah, so there are specific binds.  Nice, but also kind of dumb you can't do it through the buttons.
[3:23:13] <%xbb1024> Research capitalism and just pay your soldiers in wheat futures
[3:23:14] <ColRedyx> Ctrl + period
[3:23:15] <StStGold> yeah pat i'm sure your army's usually massive it's just the angle or the lighting making it look small

[3:25:26] <%SWFanatic> its hypnotic
[3:25:27] <gespenstkick> The spiral dance makes them harder
[3:25:27] <FullMetalSnorlax> But how will they build without doing the building dance to bless their creations?
[3:25:27] <%studleydoorite> penguins use a similar tactic to stay warm
[3:25:29] <Zombrocom> They all want to build the one ram together

[3:29:36] <@Ranryu692> making chainmail
[3:29:39] <%Anime_Flux> Education? In MY video game?!
[3:29:42] <OvaltineDream> Holla if you hear him
[3:29:42] <%SirGO0SE> Mail making? Pepe Silvia?!!?!
[3:29:45] <NeroInfinite> It shows you how mail armor do
[3:29:46] <%Cozy90> MALE Kappa
[3:29:46] <+trackles_64> History
[3:29:46] <%Monkeyweed21> SCOTT STEINER
[3:29:48] <idse12> lotr behind the scenes
[3:29:51] <FullMetalSnorlax> DAngit I hate the postal system
[3:29:53] <+trackles_64> we learning stuff
[3:29:54] <%Fooguwu> wish i was dressed head to toe in males rn
[3:29:56] <+kewlmyc> this is cool as shit
[3:29:56] <%Ne1son> Literally just a History Channel Show
[3:29:59] <luftraumm1> this game is dope
[3:30:04] <%studleydoorite> now we wear hoodies lol
[3:30:06] <%tanarath> back under the Fingrench crown.
[3:30:07] <mayormanders> this is so odd for a game
[3:30:08] <churropoppa> this is straight up like a history channel special LUL
[3:30:09] <%SirGO0SE> while you were playing age of empires, he was studying the blade
[3:30:12] <afronooch> this really is History Channel pre-pawn stars
[3:30:13] <Dr_Mooose> neat
[3:30:15] <%slimmixrp> This live action shit is so weird
[3:30:18] <Inparadisum> with 60 defence you can equip a dragon chainmail
[3:30:23] <%SirGO0SE> i LOVE edutainment
[3:30:26] <OvaltineDream> God I would have eaten this shit up as a kid
[3:30:26] <olm46> Armor is garbo in fiction
[3:30:26] <Charuzu> because what psycho would wear mail with bare skin
[3:30:28] <FullMetalSnorlax> wont stop stabbing
[3:30:36] <jorniev> FUCK... ITS REAL PEOPLE
[3:30:36] <%greasypete00> yeah
[3:30:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Armor is a superpower
[3:30:36] <%Nekros4442> yep
[3:30:38] <@Ranryu692> yeah they're basically indestructible
[3:30:40] <OvaltineDream> Useless hollywood armour
[3:30:42] <+embranz> Spears and arrows fuck it but yeah
[3:30:43] <%Nekros4442> Platemail is literally just super armor
[3:30:44] <%Ne1son> Until guns happened
[3:30:45] <luftraumm1> most armor really
[3:30:46] <%notsoy> yeah, to kill dudes in armor you had to knock them down and stab the holes
[3:30:48] <%SirGO0SE> yeah the armor is invincible its the squishy person under who isnt
[3:30:49] <%Bluwizard21> Plate mail was so powerful it stopped early rifles but cost too much
[3:30:50] <kinkade_77> plate armor is so sick
[3:30:50] <%Fooguwu> unless they have a hammer
[3:30:51] <Visorak6> Until a warhammer or pick is introduced
[3:30:52] <jorniev> BIG NUMBER GOES UP
[3:30:53] <%tanarath> Pretty much.
[3:30:54] <jumpyhugs> plate mail drains stamina tho
[3:30:55] <%greasypete00> no even the crotch was pretty well guarded
[3:30:55] <+RealThiele> making chainmail sucks
[3:30:56] <moonmintparadise> Yeah you were basically the medieval equivalent of a TANK
[3:30:57] <%Rumbutt> it's just you need to ride a horse to be able to go anywhere
[3:30:59] <FullMetalSnorlax> NOPE a good club will still kill a man in armour
[3:30:59] <luftraumm1> arrows could pierce it
[3:31:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> unless you had a blunt weapon
[3:31:01] <%Anime_Flux> These graphics are AMAZING Kappa
[3:31:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Jeez must take forever to make a whole shirt
[3:31:02] <mads_valentine> Or get a big fucking hammer with a spike
[3:31:04] <+OG_M_Bison> Pat becoming reactionary twitch streamer now PogChamp
[3:31:05] <+trackles_64> technology
[3:31:06] <%Deft_Thought> Too expensive to make and maintain
[3:31:10] <mayormanders> mustve taken forever
[3:31:10] <%The_Protagonist> the amount of fucking work that goes into this too yeah
[3:31:12] <%SirGO0SE> a lot of the time the armor wouldnt be pierced and the impact would kill the person wearing it
[3:31:16] <moonmintparadise> yeah but mail was hard to make an expensive
[3:31:16] <@Ranryu692> god this must take so long
[3:31:17] <akitanito> yep
[3:31:18] <%bevyrage> it is!
[3:31:18] <%Deft_Thought> And putting it on required assistance
[3:31:19] <+trackles_64> it is
[3:31:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> yes
[3:31:21] <MarsKarl> a nice hammer can solve the problems of a helmet
[3:31:21] <%SaiyanShoto> wait my stream froze and just came back is this still the game? LUL
[3:31:21] <%SirGO0SE> hence why blunt weapons became OP
[3:31:24] <krin_x> it is
[3:31:24] <%Nekros4442> HELL YEAH IT IS
[3:31:25] <%Bluwizard21> Labor and costly
[3:31:26] <PhilanthropyG> now imagine thousands of these
[3:31:27] <$SGrim> Thousand man-hours per set on average
[3:31:27] <%bootysteve> It takes forever but anyone can do it so it was easy to produce at scale
[3:31:27] <NeroInfinite> It is.
[3:31:29] <GemeSvev> yo Blacksmiths are bonkers
[3:31:29] <vile_brand> imagine if you got the wrong size
[3:31:29] <idse12> yea this was a full time job man
[3:31:30] <Seth_Tek> D&D has all ways gotten Armor wrong which is kinda insane considering that Gygax was obsessed with the medieval period
[3:31:31] <+RowenCleric> the chain mail socks always look so dumb
[3:31:32] <FullMetalSnorlax> Stabbing still pretty effective against mail and even plate mail
[3:31:33] <%AnthroMetal> now just imagine how fucking heavy that is
[3:31:34] <$scallycap> this looks heavy and a pain in the ass
[3:31:34] <%DooWopShaBop> Why is there live action cutscenes?
[3:31:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> Blame D&D. Bunch of horseshit.
[3:31:35] <%Nekros4442> REMEMBER THAT LORD OF THE RINGS PRODUCTION HAD REAL CHAINMAIL SHIT MADE
[3:31:37] <+trackles_64> PLus muskets made it irelevant
[3:31:37] <+titansloth93> god imagine all the pinching
[3:31:39] <moonmintparadise> yeah thats why an army was just like 30 dudes in armor
[3:31:39] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:40] <JetpackMcQuack> nothing better to do
[3:31:41] <impulse255dj> and thats why only rich people had armour.
[3:31:43] <jorniev> LIKE 30 THOUSAND DUDES IN THESE
[3:31:43] <idse12> skilled labor, there were guilds for this
[3:31:44] <luftraumm1> pretty much for cavalry only
[3:31:45] <krin_x> tried it takes forever
[3:31:46] <AngryAsian5> GASP
[3:31:50] <%Deft_Thought> Braaaaaaaaaaan
[3:31:53] <AngryAsian5> AN ELBOW?
[3:31:57] <$scallycap> lmao fuck thiss
[3:32:01] <akitanito> that's a strong marriage proposal
[3:32:02] <OvaltineDream> That sounds like it suuuucks to make
[3:32:05] <%SirGO0SE> yeah iirc this is why swords moved to the french fencing style
[3:32:06] <%Rumbutt> FUCKING EAT YOUR HEART OUT SONIC, 200K RINGS
[3:32:08] <churropoppa> fuuuuuuuuuck that
[3:32:12] <%Valdorick> REMINDER THAT HAVING GOLDEN MAIL WAS FUCKING TERRIBLE
[3:32:13] <Visorak6> Months
[3:32:13] <MarsKarl> MONTHS
[3:32:14] <%SirGO0SE> so they could get under the armor and kill near the armpit
[3:32:16] <%greasypete00> months at the least
[3:32:16] <vnzuelandude> Yeah put soft gold in your mail
[3:32:16] <PhilanthropyG> like sewing, but metal.
[3:32:17] <%The_Protagonist> imagine a full army wearing that though
[3:32:18] <+trackles_64> 2 days
[3:32:18] <%Bluwizard21> months of dedicated labor
[3:32:19] <%slimmixrp> Scavengs that shit
[3:32:20] <moonmintparadise> child labor
[3:32:22] <Jack_of_No_Trades> For real
[3:32:23] <Marhunter7> Plate mail being so hard to deal with is why they started using hammers. Don't have to break the plate or chainmail if you break every bone underneath it
[3:32:23] <Dr_Mooose> not like they had much else to do
[3:32:24] <+titansloth93> probably paid thru the nose for it tho
[3:32:24] <%Anime_Flux> But why? Gold is such a soft metal
[3:32:25] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt war is expensive
[3:32:26] <NeroInfinite> Literally months if not years.
[3:32:26] <Jack_of_No_Trades> this game rocks
[3:32:27] <slix3431> Fucking peasant you're making rings
[3:32:27] <%cvp5127> why are we  watching bbc?
[3:32:29] <+trackles_64> or a musket
[3:32:29] <mayormanders> but gold is soft
[3:32:29] <%tanarath> Years
[3:32:29] <olm46> Or dysentery
[3:32:30] <jorniev> SCEPT SPEARS AND HAMMERS
[3:32:31] <%Nekros4442> YEYEYE
[3:32:31] <%SWFanatic> damn
[3:32:33] <MarsKarl> then you drink river water ONCE
[3:32:34] <cthulu_fearlock> or just sickness
[3:32:34] <General_Terro> LUL
[3:32:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Or you shityourself to death
[3:32:35] <Gorgs7> or fall off a horse
[3:32:35] <%CalderGaming> THOSE FUCKIN GUNRATS
[3:32:37] <+The_Grey_Wraith> Or you die of gout randomly
[3:32:37] <%Valdorick> Or your son puts shit under your inn
[3:32:38] <%bevyrage> casual reminder that gold is toxic when absorbed through the skin due to sweat
[3:32:38] <afronooch> Or dysentery
[3:32:39] <slix3431> Ratling gunners
[3:32:41] <+OG_M_Bison> Skaven be a problem back then FeelsBadMan
[3:32:41] <%Monkeyweed21> RATMEN ARENT REAL PAT
[3:32:41] <gespenstkick> Or you get stabbed with a spear
[3:32:41] <captainnathaniel> you get get the shits and die shitting
[3:32:42] <GemeSvev> A Pasta Rat with a gun??
[3:32:43] <OvaltineDream> They never watch out for the wives
[3:32:44] <%notsoy> RATS WITH GUNS - speaking of, when's warhammer 3?
[3:32:46] <+Tetraporc> rats on boat? But I thought rats couldn't swim rooThink
[3:32:47] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Adventure awaits!
[3:32:48] <luftraumm1> or you get syphilis
[3:32:49] <+A0N33> I, for one, died to one of those rats with guns
[3:32:50] <jorniev> A RAT!?
[3:32:50] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> those are my worries today
[3:32:53] <$scallycap> i cant wait to hear Woolies reaction to this on the podcast
[3:32:54] <+A0N33> So I would know
[3:32:55] <mayormanders> henry at it again
[3:32:56] <+demon1103> "rat shoots you with a gun". Darn you Skaven!!!
[3:32:56] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> you fool, tis the orangutan on the boat that you should fear
[3:32:56] <StStGold> Were the rats on the boat because they can't swim?
[3:32:57] <jam1412585> King Henry was a thot
[3:32:58] <%AnthroMetal> it's why scavenging a battlefield was LUCARITIVE
[3:32:59] <moonmintparadise> Yeah it speaks volume how you could either wage a small war or pay for ONE painting of yourself. Shit was expensive as fuck
[3:32:59] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt or fall off a horse because of the weight of your chainmail
[3:33:00] <+WeLucklessJacks> Or a fish looks at you wrong.
[3:33:02] <FassieFons> SHOOT-SHOOT THE MAN-THING
[3:33:02] <CrimsonFox777> Stupid Ratling Guns.
[3:33:03] <Inparadisum> henry's picture is so good
[3:33:04] <%Nekros4442> I legit love the HIstory Channel format they went with
[3:33:05] <%notsoy> @PatStaresAt did you ever play the skaven with the DLC that gives them guns?
[3:33:05] <%MightyDuckShoes> Rats pioneered gunmanship
[3:33:05] <%studleydoorite> "king henry was pogging out"
[3:33:05] <%Nekros4442> This is amazing
[3:33:06] <%Paperware> Local Marine Biologist shot by RAT
[3:33:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @notsoy probably the same week as Elden Ring
[3:33:08] <FullMetalSnorlax> Imagine spending your whole life making chain mail rings, then all the people die to the black plauge
[3:33:15] <%livlinn> LUL
[3:33:16] <Gray_LoFi> Pat you can't just summarize like 500 years of history like that
[3:33:17] <vnzuelandude> MOM SAID ITS MY TURN TO RULE ENGLAND
[3:33:18] <Mattais88> More Frech though
[3:33:19] <SaltyAzteca> "Mom says its my turn on the land"
[3:33:20] <%xbb1024> It's all Pat's land
[3:33:21] <%SharkMissile> This land is my land, this land is my land, I'm gonna kill you
[3:33:24] <MarsKarl> >owning pieces of creation
[3:33:26] <%MightyDuckShoes> Look at those dweebs
[3:33:29] <captainnathaniel> thousands died because 2 brothers were having a hissy fit
[3:33:32] <jam1412585> We are all products of incest
[3:33:33] <%Cozy90> the battle of the boratheons
[3:33:33] <rosysyntax> battle of taintpray lets goooo
[3:33:35] <+metalicblackcherry> mom said it's my turn with normandy
[3:33:36] <%The_Protagonist> @luftraumm1 or your wife poisons an arrow with syphilis and has a rat load it into a gun and shoot you in the face with it
[3:33:38] <%Nekros4442> What do you mean 500?
[3:33:39] <%SharkMissile> That's summarizing 5000 years of history
[3:33:42] <+trackles_64> alsoslavery
[3:33:42] <%Nekros4442> It's the entire history of man
[3:33:42] <%AnthroMetal> you did it
[3:33:43] <@ssjklyco> Pats not even wrong
[3:33:46] <%AnthroMetal> you solved it
[3:33:48] <+trackles_64> no iti snt
[3:33:50] <%PrimalDweeb> Assholes, were being assholes. That's history.
[3:33:52] <%Ne1son> More "Complex"
[3:33:57] <JetpackMcQuack> brothers fighting is like 15%
[3:34:02] <@Ranryu692> and then the Beavers ruled for 100 years
[3:34:06] <CrimsonFox777> "I'm the older one!" "Shut up! Dad said I could be king!" *Tens of thousands of peasants die*
[3:34:08] <+trackles_64> Hostory of canada isbasically pancakes and syrup
[3:34:09] <%MightyDuckShoes> Mine! -History Abridged
[3:34:12] <%SharkMissile> So much syphillis
[3:34:13] <%Anime_Flux> All of history: "Wait, you're not ME! I'll KILL YOU!"
[3:34:14] <jam1412585> French is a speech impediment
[3:34:14] <gespenstkick> You summarized all human conflict in CSB once as the two first people going "What the hell, that's not me"
[3:34:16] <AngryAsian5> Man, siblings fight over the smallest shit, like controllers and TV remotes. Imagine fighting over whole ass countries.
[3:34:18] <GemeSvev> Yooo King Louis with the strats
[3:34:18] <%xbb1024> so the first settlers didn't have any women!?
[3:34:20] <%SirGO0SE> did you know claymores werent actually that popular and most armies would only carry a few? they were considered almost useless in hand to hand combat and mostly used to kill horses
[3:34:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Is it complex because there's a lot more sorry in it?
[3:34:20] <vonmaultke> What ever works I guess
[3:34:23] <NeroInfinite> Imagine spending your whole life making plate armor and ring mail only for someone to bring gunpowder from asia and have a peasant shoot a hole in his chest.
[3:34:25] <%bravebravesrobin> the power of pussy
[3:34:27] <OvaltineDream> Gotta stop  them metis
[3:34:35] <mantyz> this gives me kingdom come vibes
[3:34:36] <OvaltineDream> but don't actually
[3:34:37] <Mattais88> Was that to counteract the Metis?
[3:34:39] <+trackles_64> we started
[3:34:40] <@Ranryu692> smooth move
[3:34:43] <akitanito> STUCK
[3:34:46] <JetpackMcQuack> shit we under siege
[3:34:52] <%livlinn> woolieACCIDENT
[3:34:52] <Gorgs7> "Mine", "No, Mine!", "I'll kill you" - All of history summarized
[3:34:59] <+RealThiele> PUNCH THE STONES HARDER
[3:35:06] <%notsoy> TREBUCHET?!
[3:35:17] <%notsoy> NO IT MUST BE TREBUCHETS
[3:35:17] <+AlucardX60> Burning things is a very traditional way to solve problems.
[3:35:18] <$ItsRatman> What about the opposite? Flooding it :O
[3:35:23] <Marhunter7> Meanwhile in the 13 american colonies: *the colonies* - "yo wtf is up with these taxes?" *england* - "shut up pay me"
[3:35:28] <jorniev> WORLD HISTORY STAAAAAR!
[3:35:29] <Inparadisum> the entire city must be purged
[3:35:33] <%notsoy> what if we threw a really big rock at it?
[3:35:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Orphanage: Growth +3
[3:35:41] <LlamaZarate> Anyone know if AoE4 has Petards?
[3:35:42] <jam1412585> What
[3:35:57] <%tanarath> If only Ichiban and Kiryu had been around to stop all of this bullshit.
[3:36:13] <%SirGO0SE> also i think fiction has colored the sword as the end all goat medieval weapon but realistically spears were always the king/most popular
[3:36:27] <+demon1103> Lord Patrick, the villagers are starving. Pat: have you tried burning them...lot less mouths to feed
[3:36:54] <+Unlimited_Coffee_Works> swords were basically just showing off how rich you were weren't they?
[3:37:01] <%bootysteve> Spears are great cause they keep the jackass with the sword Over There
[3:37:04] <%tanarath> @marhunter7 So, fun fact, those taxes were mostly for the ultra rich, who were moving to the colonies for tax reasons. Independence was for tax reasons.
[3:37:10] <$An_Aimless_Avocado> did his camera freeze too? happened to like 3 other streamers all at once lol
[3:37:12] <%SirGO0SE> @Unlimited_Coffee_Works pretty much
[3:37:23] <Marhunter7> @SirGO0SE and the axe... because they were super cheap and near everyone had one anyway.
[3:37:29] <LlamaZarate> More or less, swords were a portable status symbol. Couldn't carry a spear around town
[3:37:47] <%bootysteve> Harder to get simpler than pointed stick weapons wise
[3:37:52] <Marhunter7> @tanarath its always taxes
[3:37:54] <churropoppa> R E L O A D
[3:37:54] <jumpyhugs> reload
[3:38:11] <%SirGO0SE> @Marhunter7 funny enough the written history of the axe is well detailed but from exhibits ive been to theres never a large display
[3:38:20] <%SirGO0SE> its probably because they were all cheaply made and broke down
[3:38:25] <%livlinn> noob question; is spears a thing in Souls series?
[3:38:25] <+Errickfoxy> Okay that was freakin' surreal.  I was browsing in another window and ran into an article mentioning House of the Dead just as the "Reload" played
[3:39:00] <LlamaZarate> @livlinn they exist, but the low damage usually leads people away from them
[3:39:03] <%livlinn> reload bodies
[3:39:17] <%tanarath> I swear that there are spear polearms.
[3:39:20] <OvaltineDream> nliJR

[3:41:36] <%tanarath> psaWink psaWink
[3:41:36] <LlamaZarate> @LlamaZarate but then at that point just have a thrusting sword. More damage, similar move set. I have yet to see someone in most game actually able to utilize the extra range in a meaningful way
[3:41:38] <TrollKing96> Considering how tough chainmail and platemail were, how come maces and flails weren't preferred over swords?
[3:41:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Look at ur tech tree
[3:41:45] <CrimsonFox777> @Mattais88 Does this mean we'll get a war between Elmo and Gief where most of chat dies?
[3:41:45] <Sword_of_Stupid> I didn’t realize darkest dungeon was only the one chapter. Still amazing game
[3:41:54] <captainnathaniel> MORE WAR CRIMES
[3:42:04] <Marhunter7> trebuchets are rad
[3:42:07] <%Bluwizard21> Pause
[3:42:12] <%Ne1son> @TrollKing96 Because spears are easier to use
[3:42:15] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Medieval rulers loved warcrimes
[3:42:15] <%notsoy> @TrollKing96 they were, spears and polearms were what people used in actual wars
[3:42:16] <%Monkeyweed21> esc
[3:42:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Pause the game
[3:42:18] <%CalderGaming> ladies and gentlemen: martigny and friends! WE'RE! (we're!) READY! (ready!) TO! (to!) PARTYYYY
[3:42:18] <captainnathaniel> ha! your weakness is you care about your citizens getting butchered
[3:42:19] <Mattais88> @CrimsonFox777 Isn't that most streams?
[3:42:22] <+dmbender> @TrollKing96 Most people weren't wearing Chainmail and Platemail, anybody who was would be more valuable alive because you could ransom them
[3:42:24] <%bootysteve> @TrollKing96 If you had the money and metal to make a mace or flail you were probably just gonna get a sword made for the status of it, most soldiers used spears
[3:42:29] <%tanarath> @trollking96 status & plate + chain was expensive. Also gentlemen's agreements.
[3:42:41] <LlamaZarate> @TrollKing96 VERY HEAVY. Most of the time in war is moving from point to point. Also, physics wise, flails aren't really a thing.
[3:42:46] <jam1412585> Which is better Dread or Returnal
[3:42:59] <OvaltineDream> YEAH SALT THE PEASANTS
[3:43:01] <FullMetalSnorlax> That's the trick swords were never popular. Spears saw much more use
[3:43:04] <%SirGO0SE> @TrollKing96 flails were a skill weapon, maces were popular, but spears were the champs
[3:43:04] <%Anime_Flux> @CalderGaming We're ready, to party! We're ready!
[3:43:11] <%pokefan9956> WAR CRIMES
[3:43:11] <ovan20> murder rooH
[3:43:16] <%Ne1son> TROGDOR
[3:43:22] <JetpackMcQuack> :) cool
[3:43:23] <%notsoy> tell your hero to beat up archers, they can't fight back
[3:43:25] <Marhunter7> @PatStaresAt and their thatched roofed cottages!!!
[3:43:28] <%Bluwizard21> Ok that is not a good tech tree display, I think the expanded would be better but it should show you your upgrade paths available yo the nation you picked
[3:43:30] <%livlinn> cbcJerry cbcJerry cbcJerry
[3:43:34] <FullMetalSnorlax> @TrollKing96 That's the trick swords were never popular. Spears saw much more use.
[3:43:42] <LlamaZarate> Also, most of the kills on heavily armored knights/soldiers was by knocking them over and finishing them off with a dagger as far as I understand
[3:43:46] <Explodincatz> man the AI is doing more mirco than Pat
[3:43:54] <ovan20> shooting arrows on a tent LUL
[3:43:56] <%DashXero> The sad thing is that they're gonna want taxes from those peasants later...
[3:44:10] <%SirGO0SE> @LlamaZarate yep, killing the horse killed the rider most of the time
[3:44:11] <akitanito> war crimes feel good?
[3:44:17] <%livlinn> t101Listen
[3:44:17] <Sword_of_Stupid> What’s the goblin we’re fighting here today?
[3:44:20] <Gorgs7> free gold for killing peasants
[3:44:28] <homestylewaffles> these troops are real spirited
[3:44:40] <%DashXero> I guess that's why Sun Tzu was so insistent on not burning stuff down when he could...
[3:44:41] <%SirGO0SE> oh you didnt mean cavalry, still though heavily armored knights are like turtles @LlamaZarate
[3:44:45] <ovan20> hear the lamentation of their women, men! rooH
[3:44:46] <$lotharrio> Those peasants are made of meat. Precious, valuable meat.
[3:44:46] <+embranz> war crimes are only applicable against human beings which peasants are not
[3:44:47] <akitanito> cowardddd
[3:44:50] <%tanarath> Also, swords used a lot of metal, which is expensive. Spears don't.
[3:44:53] <$ItsRatman> Yo chat since were talking medieval stuff, anyone know how to counter hunnic mounted archers?
[3:45:01] <LlamaZarate> I wonder what the odds are if your horse falls over if you femur survives getting collapsed on by an armored horse?
[3:45:01] <OvaltineDream> Take that, shitty little hamlet
[3:45:01] <%Valdorick> YEAH! RAISE THE STAKES
[3:45:03] <%Nekros4442> Bitch come out or starve inside
[3:45:10] <StStGold> Make sure there are no peasant eggs in the walls or anything, they'll spring up again real fast
[3:45:14] <captainnathaniel> imagine getting your home burned because some just just wants to bait his brother
[3:45:20] <lloyddboy> MAKE BIG
[3:45:24] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp
[3:45:24] <Gorgs7> @ItsRatman have a city, and spearmen hiding in alleyways
[3:45:26] <ovan20> doggy rooLove
[3:45:27] <jorniev> @ItsRatman canons?
[3:45:28] <%SWFanatic> She took the kids
[3:45:35] <%PrimalDweeb> But, where is all the raping and pillaging? 0/10 not realistic enough.
[3:45:40] <JetpackMcQuack> who we killin boss
[3:45:41] <%SirGO0SE> @ItsRatman this
[3:45:43] <LlamaZarate> @ItsRatman I assume with a mass of archers. Not efficient 1 v 1, but cost effective. That and anyway to get pierce armor
[3:45:48] <%tanarath> if you want an anti armour weapon, either a warpick, a hammer, or halfswording are your friend.
[3:45:49] <Marhunter7> @LlamaZarate They would also smack them with a hammer, cause the impact could K.O. them if hit to the head if it didn't kill them.
[3:45:49] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[3:45:50] <%Valdorick> What if, and hear me out... We raise the peasants on the stakes... Ha ha, just kidding... unless?... Nah, surely not... But...?
[3:45:51] <%SWFanatic> <3
[3:46:02] <+kawachipto> how be gaem?
[3:46:07] <Midnight188> drat i got no money to donate, cant tell the peeps my ffxiv progress is going well.
[3:46:10] <%SirGO0SE> hunnic archers were the peak fighting unit before gunpowder
[3:46:16] <Kain5707> Pat let Gief play!
[3:46:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> These games are so weird to me
[3:46:41] <Visorak6> Lances are fucked up weapons
[3:46:50] <captainnathaniel> so like, every mission in this campaign had village burning, with the narrator cstating numerous times it IS village pillaging. Props for not keeping history PG i guess
[3:47:03] <StStGold> Load all the peasants into trebuchets and launch them at your enemies
[3:47:06] <treehouse63> i love my mom but this hamburger helper sucks my warty cock
[3:47:07] <%notsoy> hold shift when click-dragging to add to your currently selected units
[3:47:09] <JetpackMcQuack> do football plays
[3:47:13] <akitanito> formations you mean?
[3:47:19] <%SirGO0SE> a lot of theory behind the hunns/asia being the origination of the native americans is supported by their skill on horseback
[3:47:22] <@Ranryu692> they QOL'd your mind goblins out of the genre
[3:47:22] <%tanarath> You defeat the hunnic archers by denying them rest, using wildfires, etc.
[3:47:26] <%kyh9> I'm happy the game actually teaches you how to play an RTS
[3:47:31] <%CalderGaming> these early missions aren't demanding a lot in terms of managing multiple parts of the map at once
[3:47:34] <%Monkeyweed21> you should try 1 multplayer match
[3:47:44] <%livlinn> !uptime
[3:47:44] <@Moobot> @livlinn I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:48:06] <%notsoy> I'LL KILL YOU
[3:48:07] <jorniev> can he do a match against ai? or just multiplayer ?
[3:48:08] <%Valdorick> Relief them of life
[3:48:16] <+embranz> cavalry in to spearmen lul
[3:48:21] <%DashXero> What the fuck is going on there?
[3:48:33] <%Anime_Flux> Ping! Clang!
[3:48:36] <akitanito> I want to go back and play mount and blade
[3:48:43] <jorniev> STICK THEM WITH THE POINTY END
[3:48:44] <+embranz> oh was it i didnt see from this angle lol just saw the spars
[3:48:46] <+embranz> spears*
[3:48:51] <NeroInfinite> embranz blind as heck
[3:48:53] <treehouse63> this visual is me  when someone says the shape of water sucks
[3:48:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Well that only works once
[3:49:01] <Kain5707> why does this look sped up
[3:49:02] <%Valdorick> Its a route
[3:49:15] <%Valdorick> YEAH, STEAL THE PEASANTS MONEY
[3:49:17] <%SirGO0SE> man even though they were rare it must have been fucking bad ass to lop a horses head off with a claymore in 1 shot
[3:49:39] <%DashXero> How many anime protagonists were made that day?
[3:49:54] <captainnathaniel> at least 4
[3:50:05] <%PrimalDweeb> @SirGO0SE Um, do you need to talk to someone?
[3:50:10] <Marhunter7> @DashXero all of them
[3:50:12] <LlamaZarate> @SirGO0SE I'm trying to imagine the angle you'd have to get to do that to one mid gallop. Certainly possible, but wild to see
[3:50:19] <Visorak6> deathstar is always fun
[3:50:31] <PhilanthropyG> Apocalypse Tanks in Red Alert 2, or a ton of sky pilots...also in Red Alert 2.
[3:50:33] <%Nekros4442> Pat the type of guy to get 200 marines or 20 battlecruisers
[3:50:34] <peyodogo> isn't that a goblin of its own
[3:50:40] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE LUL cmon its metal af
[3:50:46] <%athuramn> Goblin says: I don't care for the middle of the road
[3:50:51] <OvaltineDream> I too apreciate drowning my enemy in shit tier mooks
[3:51:05] <ArgentUndaCova> Pat will probably love the elephants then Jebaited
[3:51:11] <Marhunter7> @SirGO0SE and then you have the psychos that were the germanic mercinaries with zwiehanders charging into fronts to break the spears
[3:51:12] <%athuramn> though I guess that's strategy in its own way
[3:51:15] <jorniev> is pat feeding the goblin or fighting it im not sure?
[3:51:18] <%Anime_Flux> Sorry, Frenes. No one told you it was gonna be this way...
[3:51:29] <JetpackMcQuack> I like having something that can take a hit
[3:51:34] <%PrimalDweeb> @SirGO0SE I don't know about that... LUL
[3:51:58] <%espanishcanamurciana> wow, maybe the age of empires were the defenseless villages we burned along the way
[3:52:03] <LlamaZarate> It is pretty wild how much they pulled back the spear vs cavalry mega counter. I will still miss ranged inaccuracy and a cool onager/mangonnel
[3:52:06] <JetpackMcQuack> zerg players veryhaStare
[3:52:12] <jorniev> man i miss berserk
[3:52:25] <%DashXero> This supposed to be france?

[3:52:38] <Visorak6> Jesus christ I misheard that simlish as "bring us newports" and I choked on my drink
[3:52:43] <Midnight188> "what if we just sack every village that'd really dab on the french lol"
[3:52:47] <LlamaZarate> @DashXero nah, English/Norman campaign

[3:59:40] <@Ranryu692> I took a Russian history class in university. The material was interesting, but unfortunately the professor was not
[3:59:41] <Redmannasah> You can pronounce it as Jengis, Ghengis or Chinggus, they're all fine
[3:59:44] <%ospreyworks> ra ra rasputin

[4:00:49] <captain_kirkhammer> It's also *super hard* to pull off with thousands of men
[4:00:50] <Shacklebox> yo but the mongols were GOOD at it
[4:00:50] <+trackles_64> And they fal for it everytime
[4:00:51] <%Valdorick> I mean, Parthian Horse Archers are basically like having a Jetpack and Ray gun, so yeah, I could see Woolie maining Mongolia
[4:00:51] <Parapattern> That's because it was pretty much invented here
[4:00:51] <%Puhff> Yeah but BACK THEN it wasn't old Keppo

[4:03:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt I don't understand. why are u not simply sending wave upon wave of your own men at the rus until their kill counters fill to a predesignated kill limit, forcing them to shut down?
[4:04:01] <luftraumm1> don't take that lancer with you

[4:04:26] <%athuramn> that was some bitch ass provocation
[4:04:38] <+DeaconBluesClues> why isn't pat playing online ONE ON ONE LADDER the realest fighting game of all
[4:04:42] <%kyh9> MONGOLS LETS GO
[4:04:52] <CanadianAdam> you drew in everyone. not like a third of them
[4:04:54] <luftraumm1> pull the archers oooout
[4:04:54] <%Anime_Flux> now you'll face the wrath of Khan!
[4:04:58] <PainfulAlternatingCurrent> Wow incredible ambush
[4:05:00] <%bevyrage> keep kiting with your archers
[4:05:06] <$scallycap> nah its pretty fuckin good
[4:05:07] <Visorak6> your horse archers are getting shredded in melee
[4:05:07] <%kyh9> Wait till the archesrs are dead
[4:05:09] <CanadianAdam> also you have archers fighting in melee
[4:05:10] <akitanito> I don't think this is an ambush
[4:05:13] <+Chex868> lol charged horses intp spears
[4:05:14] <%Cozy90> @LlamaZarate hahahah! like that
[4:05:17] <JetpackMcQuack> we divided our army and lost on all three fronts
[4:05:19] <MrATheGreat> I  think you were supposed to keep moving with the horse archrs
[4:05:22] <%notsoy> you let your horse archers get caught and shredded
[4:05:23] <Marhunter7> need to start tearing down some city walls with these mongolians
[4:05:23] <luftraumm1> archers got  wrecked
[4:05:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> with bows pat
[4:05:25] <Shacklebox> "oh this is the kite faction" does 0 kiting
[4:05:27] <akitanito> how much do you need to micro the horse archers?
[4:05:27] <%bevyrage> pat they don't have melee weapons
[4:05:28] <%kyh9> ????
[4:05:28] <$scallycap> yeah theyre horses fighting fucking SPEARSS
[4:05:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> YES WAVE UPON WAVE OF YOUR OWN MEN
[4:05:32] <CrimsonFox777> Yes, but they're against spears.
[4:05:34] <$ItsRatman> Eh good enough
[4:05:36] <captainnathaniel> why would you let the horse archers die like that?
[4:05:36] <%kyh9> Thats worse for the horsies.  Spears >>> Horsies
[4:05:38] <%Monkeyweed21> why did you charge horse archers in?
[4:05:41] <%kyh9> Spears DIRECTLY beat horsies
[4:05:42] <%athuramn> loss of life just now was incredible
[4:05:56] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:05:57] <+DeaconBluesClues> CASULTIES DO NOT MATTER. SEND IN THE NEXT WAVE
[4:05:58] <$scallycap> spears fuck up horses every time
[4:05:59] <%Valdorick> Archers > Spearmen > Horses. Kite spears with horse archers and they won't body you.
[4:06:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat has one tactic: Zerg rush
[4:06:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> spears are anti horse tech
[4:06:01] <%bevyrage> much less impressive when the play was dull
[4:06:02] <captain_kirkhammer> Pikemen havbe been the hard counter for hosies for like a billions years
[4:06:02] <CanadianAdam> not the best ambush i've ever seen
[4:06:07] <%Puhff> you lost  ALOT
[4:06:11] <luftraumm1> I hope this mission ends soon
[4:06:11] <%athuramn> I guess LUL
[4:06:12] <%kyh9> @athuramn HORSE ARCHERS!  STAND THERE WHILE YOU GET FUCKED
[4:06:14] <CrimsonFox777> COM-RAIDS
[4:06:16] <CrowbarFacelift> throw bodies at it until we win
[4:06:19] <Shacklebox> just all the archers
[4:06:21] <Mattais88> Circling the wagons
[4:06:22] <akitanito> it was more devastating to you
[4:06:27] <%kyh9> YOU JUST LOST YOUR BEST ARCHERS
[4:06:30] <LlamaZarate> So, I'm going to try not to, but where is the line between saying things that aren't obvious and backseating?
[4:06:35] <%kyh9> THE THING THE MONGOLS WERE KNOWN FOR
[4:06:36] <CanadianAdam> "range units. attack in melee range and stand still"
[4:06:39] <captainnathaniel> shittiest general ever
[4:06:40] <luftraumm1> it was a pyrrhic victory
[4:06:50] <Marhunter7> @PatStaresAt pyrrhic victory is still a victory!
[4:06:52] <%kyh9> Pat, the reason the Mongols beat up nearly all of China was because of Horse Archers
[4:07:03] <+DeaconBluesClues> KHAN CARES NOT WHERE THE BLOOD FLOWS FROM, ONLY THAT IT DOES
[4:07:03] <NeroInfinite> you literally lost all your best units pat.
[4:07:04] <akitanito> LUL
[4:07:08] <StStGold> Who needs the exact thing that made the Mongols one of the best forces in human history anyway
[4:07:11] <%athuramn> ranged barrage incoming
[4:07:12] <%Gamblitz> a True Tactic worthy of French General Robert Nivelle
[4:07:15] <$ItsRatman> The counter to horse archers is to pray they stand still i guess XD
[4:07:25] <%kyh9> @StStGold Not PatStaresAt!
[4:07:28] <CanadianAdam> good thing you're playing on little bitch difficutly
[4:07:32] <sentientvin> oh no
[4:07:32] <%GIGA255> your horse archers can't even wavedash. melee is a lost cause
[4:07:36] <+DeaconBluesClues> SEND. IN. THE. NEXT. WAVE! @PatStaresAt
[4:07:42] <%kyh9> You might lose this, Pat
[4:07:52] <captainnathaniel> the counter to mongols is to hope @PatStaresAt is the one playing them
[4:07:56] <%kyh9> Well, the AI isn't kiting you
[4:08:03] <%kyh9> LAST ARCHER
[4:08:04] <Mattais88> One guy left
[4:08:05] <$scallycap> hey Pat have you heard of the phrase "pyrrhic victory"?
[4:08:06] <%kyh9> RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE
[4:08:07] <%notsoy> lol brettonia in warhammer would be perfect for pat, elite heavy cavalry and shitty expendable infantry
[4:08:16] <%CalderGaming> easy mode: the ultimate horse archer
[4:08:18] <OvaltineDream> You. Did it.
[4:08:18] <%Monkeyweed21> pyrhic victory one easy yea
[4:08:18] <%kyh9> Did you hear that last Archer sobbing?
[4:08:18] <%Gamblitz> Marco Polo would be proud
[4:08:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> @kyh9 look at this fool who does not believe in drowning the enemy under a wave of human flesh! laugh at him men, laugh!
[4:08:21] <%bevyrage> also no archers
[4:08:30] <StStGold> "crushing"
[4:08:46] <$ItsRatman> @notsoy But then Pat would have to play as the stinky french
[4:08:46] <captain_kirkhammer> @notsoy Well, he is Breton
[4:08:48] <LlamaZarate> @kyh9 even better, that was the Khan unit
[4:08:49] <%AncelDeLambert> "Gentlemen, we stand on the field of victory"
[4:08:49] <%Anime_Flux> Yay..?
[4:08:49] <luftraumm1> imagine this narrator lady narrated you pooping?
[4:08:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I wouldn't call that crushing but ok
[4:08:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> next stop Kiev
[4:08:51] <Dr_Mooose> wins a win
[4:08:57] <Mattais88> And now we don't have to feed them
[4:08:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat went full Rimmer, lol
[4:08:57] <$scallycap> he who stands last stands tallest
[4:09:00] <vonmaultke> a physic victory
[4:09:06] <%tanarath> crushing it on easy.
[4:09:08] <%AnthroMetal> hell yea
