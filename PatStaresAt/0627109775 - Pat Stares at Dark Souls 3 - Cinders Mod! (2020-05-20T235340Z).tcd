[0:12:29] <ha2ken> The pirate's life is the life for me
[0:12:30] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> capitalism is the only moral right
[0:12:31] <%JackalKing> The Tale of Two Wastelands mod for the Fallout games can only run on official versions, but that is for legal reasons so THEY wouldn't get accused of piracy because of how the mod works

[0:30:09] <%ElenaManetta> is that the true love story
[0:30:10] <%SmoothEnigma> My ONLY complaint about Cinders so far while I'm playing it is that SOLAIRE IS OP AF! I've been able to no hit bosses by letting him just do all the work
[0:30:12] <%Skittlesoul> did pat get the deep ring?
[0:30:13] <%ElenaManetta> big hat boy, tiny hat girl

[0:30:25] <%megaman_sentinel> big hat really means what

[0:31:27] <Security_Jack> Cinders is what Dark Souls 3 should have been. It's fan-fucking-tastic. And torch is actually a viable weapon, early game.
[0:31:30] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, is the torch indeed, upgradeable?
[0:31:33] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat I learned today that you can piss off the training skeleton if you do way to much damage

[0:52:11] <jhonxiolonn> he also comes here when you do the firekeeper questline, but at the bottom of the place
[0:52:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Random enemy placement becomes good design in a mod for some reason
[0:52:13] <Monkeyweed21> missed something back there
[0:52:14] <%PaladinDupre> You missed an item at the edge behind the boxes to the left of the big locked door
[0:52:14] <Pookiedaexzile> does PAige know

[0:52:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> This whole game is anor londo
[0:52:56] <%Mr_Pylon> This is another country's Anor Londo Experience
[0:52:57] <Zombrocom> A fair bit tamer than anor londo was though
[0:53:00] <pennykettle_> It would be so dope if the mod restored full anor londo castle
[0:53:01] <$dalmek> Andor Landor
[0:53:05] <%DedlokPM> psaWhat Is this anor londo?

[0:53:26] <%DappercatEsquire> You will be magicced
[0:53:26] <Personified134> Everything is either an Anor Londo or a Blighttown if you really think about it
[0:53:29] <brows_> More like Anor Gonedo
[0:53:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat shows us that anything can be Anor Londo with enough believe
[0:53:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Missed item left of big locked door
[0:53:41] <%JumboCrunchies> Do you need the DLC for this mod? I never got it and cant really justify the cost right now. :/

[0:54:36] <$Blitz_king01> Bruh
[0:54:37] <%Aleate> I forgot how cool some of the areas in this game are for how generic they are...
[0:54:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> resonating crystal?
[0:54:43] <%FacetiousAF> good job, spells
[0:54:45] <%DedlokPM> Good job, Staff!
[0:54:45] <+AppleBasket> what's a Resonating Crystal?
[0:54:45] <RubberFistFight> @LSpiral considering you can get the version that includes all the DLC for basically the same price as the base game, there's no reason not to get it really.
[0:54:45] <%patriotrenegade> yes, amazing, fantastic, perfect
[0:54:47] <Monkeyweed21> thats vanilla
[0:54:49] <pennykettle_> I like the pumparum items being distinct items
[0:54:53] <+superkeaton> What kind of build is pat running?
[0:54:55] <Personified134> A resonating crystal is an item to give to pumparum
[0:54:56] <%Valdorick> Dey here
[0:54:59] <%JumboCrunchies> Hexes!
[0:55:01] <+BiggestBuckets> man pat really has run out of stuff to talk about

[0:55:04] <%JumboCrunchies> Because Pat.
[0:55:04] <Zombrocom> Covenant item for way of white, i think
[0:55:05] <+Erimos> Upgrade material.
[0:55:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Did Crucible come out and nobody gave a shit?
[0:55:08] <jhonxiolonn> @Floydthemaggot look dude, it looks like a big castle, it has to be anor lendo.
[0:55:10] <%MonsieurHedge> upmat for chimes and talismans
[0:55:11] <Pookiedaexzile> PAts running a dark coomer spear build
[0:55:12] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt holy fragment is an abyssal fragment but for miracle stuff
[0:55:17] <+AppleBasket> Pat the crystal is in your Use items near the darksign
[0:55:22] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[0:55:23] <+BiggestBuckets> both are true

[0:55:58] <jhonxiolonn> we beed paige to bully pat
[0:55:58] <%arcaderabbit48> The Abyssal Fragments are covenant items, right?
[0:55:59] <huskarl_zap> felt that one cooming
[0:56:06] <+Galactic0ne> so someone in chat explain this mod to me
[0:56:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> always more
[0:56:10] <%Creggamonsta> I never beat DS3. Should I beat it before I play this mod? I beat the Boss that has a stand quit.
[0:56:12] <Zombrocom> That whole encounter is vanilla
[0:56:13] <RubberFistFight> there's always been a ton of those little asshats in there
[0:56:14] <pennykettle_> Galactic0ne everythings changed
[0:56:18] <%cureneckbeard> Pat, what would happen if you were tired, but you were to tired to make your special bedsheet envelope?
[0:56:21] <RubberFistFight> @Creggamonsta yes, absolutely beat it unmodded first.
[0:56:23] <gslayer14> beat base game first
[0:56:24] <tolloponik> why is that room cold?
[0:56:25] <fatcrab> dark souls 3 master quest
[0:56:27] <%Creggamonsta> ok
[0:56:34] <%PaladinDupre> 5, 5 thralls, ah ah ah
[0:56:36] <%Creggamonsta> I'll grind it out
[0:56:38] <%WhereIsWill> you'll never see it coming
[0:56:40] <Floydthemaggot> @jhonxiolon nah theres multiple castles like dukes archives from ds1 is just a castle
[0:56:41] <pennykettle_> even for fallout?
[0:56:41] <Aydarkzero> always play original first
[0:56:42] <rekinom> What about stalker?
[0:56:43] <DeathByPoke7> Big Hat Pat
[0:56:44] <%cureneckbeard> Odin is with us!
[0:56:45] <Treuan> I think the mod gets you banned on DS3's servers anyway right?
[0:56:47] <gslayer14> this mod is half victory lap half love letter
[0:56:48] <%FacetiousAF> oh man i could get this and run a delicious bleed build
[0:56:49] <%Creggamonsta> good point. Double the game
[0:56:49] <jhonxiolonn> unless the original is broken and bad to play
[0:56:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Galactic0ne a lot of mechanics overhauls and QOL stuff and
[0:56:50] <FalseEyeD> Double Mint Fun
[0:56:53] <+williss_> theres some classic pc games that are better played with an overhaul first
[0:56:54] <xWanderingFlame> Mod= op
[0:56:58] <%patriotrenegade> I hope the Cathedral Knights are a threat now
[0:56:59] <+bluedude153> You ever look at the Jojos mod that lets you summon enemies as stands?
[0:56:59] <worldbrand> I mean if the original game isnt enjoyable that makes sense but otherwise
[0:57:01] <theshillman> where baby?
[0:57:02] <+Smeagleman6> I think the only games that doesn't apply to is Total War games, because their base games are trash
[0:57:05] <@SoFarFetched> @Treuan the mod automatically puts you into offline mode so you don't get banned
[0:57:06] <KNWatcher> only play overhauls on games that need em
[0:57:07] <+superkeaton> @Treuan Yes, that's why you run it in offline mode
[0:57:10] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I mean I played Long War 1 first. Never even touched vanilla Xcom.
[0:57:11] <KNWatcher> first*
[0:57:15] <Floydthemaggot> this is where the mace carried my ass
[0:57:16] <tusk102> definitely play ds3 first bc then the changes will actually be significant to you @Creggamonsta
[0:57:16] <jhonxiolonn> poise is so awesome
[0:57:18] <+OwlLightningMage> The mod assumes you played the game. It's also horribly balanced
[0:57:19] <PrimordialDonut> i'm like 30 hours into this mod since you streamed it, i'm really enjoying it
[0:57:21] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[0:57:23] <$valkuma> this mod kinda trivializes every npc but the bosses seem ok
[0:57:24] <Treuan> Ah, thanks!
[0:57:27] <%PaladinDupre> @bluedude153 I remade my Solaire build and now the Solaire summoning thing is basically my stand
[0:57:28] <+Smeagleman6> Total War Warhammer base game is garbage without mods
[0:57:29] <spacegineer> What sword is that?
[0:57:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> blueblood
[0:57:39] <1matheuw> pat is fed
[0:57:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Floydthemaggot like, just the regular old mace? That's some DS2 vibes
[0:57:42] <%FacetiousAF> how can this 🅱️
[0:57:44] <%WhereIsWill> look at these not bloodborne waifus
[0:57:46] <Treuan> Pat's chat is garbage without mods
[0:57:47] <+Anonylesssss> @PatStaresAt SFO
[0:57:49] <%genowyn> How could this happen to meee
[0:57:50] <pennykettle_> In theory is there a way for the mod to make it so you can only connect to people using the mod? Like randomly changing everyone's passcode every few minutes by itself
[0:57:51] <theshillman> patrick show emlo proof of life or riot
[0:57:54] <Zombrocom> Bah, SFO is a mess
[0:57:55] <+Smeagleman6> Hold on, I'll look
[0:57:56] <huskarl_zap> Disagree
[0:57:56] <@SoFarFetched> The San Francisco Airport?
[0:57:57] <Rei_Dsoto> Cool Hat
[0:57:57] <mostundesired> @FacetiousAF A bleed build would rely on you getting the specific miracle and equipment to stack bleed, rather than scaling with luck. Items instead of stats, just FYI. I was personally really disappointed when I found out.
[0:58:00] <+Smeagleman6> I think it's Radious
[0:58:00] <+superkeaton> I wouldn't with Steel Faith Overhaul
[0:58:03] <+Solutha> SFO is not good for new players
[0:58:05] <huskarl_zap> SFO STANS BEGON
[0:58:06] <%patriotrenegade> what is why
[0:58:10] <+superkeaton> Just get the camera and cosmetic mods
[0:58:13] <%Punchasaur> one guy
[0:58:14] <Floydthemaggot> @aWanderingKaivo yup although i used it in all my initial play throughs
[0:58:14] <+ktothec99> Total War Warhammer is completely fine without mods
[0:58:15] <+Smeagleman6> It makes all of the mechanics of the game just better
[0:58:17] <%FacetiousAF> @mostundesired FeelsBadMan thanks for the info
[0:58:17] <huskarl_zap> sfo over rated
[0:58:23] <BliVru> Is the Cinders of TW Warhammer
[0:58:23] <StromkoPenguin> SFO doesn't really change the experience much IMO. I played the hell out of Twarhammer and SFO didn't refresh it for me.
[0:58:32] <1matheuw> are you pat, pat?
[0:58:37] <Zombrocom> SFO does a ton of crazy shit, it's a bit too much for me
[0:58:40] <+Smeagleman6> Radious: Total War
[0:58:41] <%FacetiousAF> hi, he's pat
[0:58:45] <+AppleBasket> what buff does the Herald armor give? I've always loved it's AESTHETIC
[0:58:53] <%NovaKnightmare> yea but theyre dex weapons
[0:58:54] <pennykettle_> I hope the giants in here are replaced with a 50x scaled Solaire
[0:58:56] <+ccwettr123> Total War Warhammer is a lot of fun without mods IMO, just avoid Chaos, Beastmen, or Wood Elves unless you want a bad time. Vampire Coast is super fun for newbies, and go for High Elves if you want a fairly easy game with dragons and phoenixes
[0:58:57] <worldbrand> there's an axe guy here in vanilla
[0:58:58] <huskarl_zap> SFO add a bunch shit that doesn't exist and changes shit because the author just doesn't like it.
[0:59:03] <Zombrocom> I think herald set gives faith
[0:59:07] <%patriotrenegade> none of those guys aggro in the vanilla
[0:59:07] <Floydthemaggot> does this mod have des weapons ?
[0:59:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> faith or vigor I think
[0:59:17] <%WhereIsWill> spent an hour farming for those!
[0:59:33] <%hax_metatron> Pat is using a DeS weapon @floydthemaggot
[0:59:39] <Floydthemaggot> sweet i wasnt sure
[0:59:40] <mostundesired> @FacetiousAF Older versions of the mod do make stat-based bleed builds work, but they don't come with all the nifty changes that come in later patches. And item-based bleed builds are still totally viable in later patches. So you can totally go for it, it's just not my personal preference.
[0:59:40] <%patriotrenegade> he was haning off the railing
[0:59:42] <+SinisterBroccoli> The dodge ability on the daggers is super powerful in this mod, because that dash is OP as fuck and now it's infinite
[0:59:47] <worldbrand> i'm rocking the penetrator sword, it's a pretty nice alternative to the baller swag sword
[0:59:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Is there a tig biddies mod
[0:59:54] <pennykettle_> Does this mod let you get Steam achievements for stuff like covenant item collection?
[1:00:03] <Sauceboss15> NOT YET
[1:00:03] <%FacetiousAF> chat don't forget to mention this mod has a few Bloodborne weapons too
[1:00:06] <Personified134> You did not miss the ladder
[1:00:07] <gslayer14> nope
[1:00:07] <Zombrocom> Nah that's way later
[1:00:08] <RubberFistFight> that happens later
[1:00:09] <FalseEyeD> Why do people create paragraphs in chat?
[1:00:09] <worldbrand> think that's elsewhere
[1:00:11] <%patriotrenegade> u did miss a part u gotta jump onto one of the arches
[1:00:15] <+SinisterBroccoli> FacetiousAF He's found tonitrus
[1:00:16] <%JumboCrunchies> I really wanna try a full dagger playthrough. So rough in vanilla Dark Souls 3.
[1:00:19] <%fetrigon> are the enemies supposed to be fodder?
[1:00:23] <%FacetiousAF> @SinisterBroccoli and the beast claws
[1:00:26] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[1:00:27] <%Punchasaur> he knows about the bloodborne stuff
[1:00:28] <RubberFistFight> @FalseEyeD because sometimes they have more than 3 words to say?
[1:00:29] <mostundesired> Nice.
[1:00:29] <ashbirds> cathedral of the deep is the best area in the game tbh
[1:00:29] <1matheuw> ye i saw the eletric club yesterday
[1:00:30] <Zombrocom> That is a sneaky chest
[1:00:30] <%Valdorick> Yooooooo
[1:00:31] <Pookiedaexzile> @FalseEyeD They got complex thoughts
[1:00:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> beast claws are dope
[1:00:33] <Personified134> shit I missed that playing it myself
[1:00:35] <huskarl_zap> Whens Hammer souls?
[1:00:35] <gslayer14> UNBLIND!
[1:00:43] <%candyboogers> candyboogers subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:00:43] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Are you ready for Amazon's hit new shooter Crucible? Neither is anyone else, because it's at Mostly Negative on Steam after being hour for like 5 hours.
[1:00:43] <+BiggestBuckets> yeah I never got it down lol
[1:00:44] <worldbrand> yeah that's fair
[1:00:45] <%kapcommunist> that chest was so smug
[1:00:48] <mostundesired> Dude, Cathedral is fucking HUGE.
[1:00:48] <BliVru> @patstaresat CHECK THE GLOVES
[1:00:49] <1matheuw> EYES ON THE OUTSIDE AS WELL
[1:00:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah I always have to look it up
[1:00:52] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt the grave warden gloves give bleed to your weapon, IIRC
[1:00:54] <%patriotrenegade> its fucking dumb
[1:00:55] <+Lost_Zombie> gloves on that set give you bleed on weapon
[1:00:56] <Personified134> Oh yeah i've missed Patches every single time i've played this mod, I just can't be fucked to do it
[1:01:09] <TheArrow_> jesus

[1:01:29] <jhonxiolonn> gloves have like good effects, always
[1:01:29] <%DensityD> this mod dislikes you
[1:01:34] <mostundesired> It is.
[1:01:36] <BliVru> @patstaresat Does not stack
[1:01:37] <%MonsieurHedge> its a little aggressive
[1:01:38] <%Creggamonsta> idk its pretty meh so far
[1:01:46] <%Creggamonsta> also u cant get into a game
[1:01:46] <mostundesired> It does.
[1:01:47] <Zombrocom> It super does
[1:01:48] <+SinisterBroccoli> Crazy talk?
[1:01:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> hear the old blood. by the gods, hear it
[1:01:49] <+visidan> atpOld

[1:01:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> IT DOES
[1:01:50] <%DappercatEsquire> Yeah, seems like a paint by numbers hero shooter.
[1:01:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Yes
[1:01:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt You can't buff weapons that have glove effects, so it's not great for spellswords
[1:01:53] <RubberFistFight> [BWARRRRRRRR]
[1:01:53] <superlit_1> it do
[1:01:54] <jhonxiolonn> it does
[1:01:54] <Zbyrd0961> barely
[1:01:54] <Zombrocom> It just takes a second to go away
[1:01:54] <ashbirds> the shrine maiden sells cosmetics to hide these effects
[1:01:55] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> no, it loud
[1:01:58] <jhonxiolonn> But it's like a breeze
[1:02:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The noise fades upon removal
[1:02:04] <%Creggamonsta> its free
[1:02:08] <%Creggamonsta> so cant hurt 2 try it

[1:10:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @jhonxiolonn Hard to say. It appears to be specific to the Dash Ring, which fucks up combat too since you're forced to dash while having it equipped

[1:10:57] <+Erimos> Still looks cool.
[1:11:04] <%MonsieurHedge> i have no idea why pat doesn't just put stuff in the bottomless box
[1:11:08] <%DedlokPM> @patriotrenegade there is a shonen jump series right now that is pretty much that
[1:11:08] <1matheuw> no transform tho

[1:19:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat is proof that magic isn't OP in this mod B)
[1:19:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Did they add much ice stuff with the mod? Was always dissapointed by how underutilized Ice was as an element in the base game
[1:19:44] <Personified134> there are more irythill knight weapon types yes
[1:19:45] <%cureneckbeard> psaHoldon
[1:19:49] <esetremendo> Pat is too smol for the big liquids
[1:19:50] <Personified134> i don't think there are that many more ice spells though
[1:19:54] <Zombrocom> Well, pat is wearing the Dark Clutch ring, so he takes big damage
[1:20:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> and gloves that just add frost to whatever weapon you have
[1:20:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @arcaderabbit48 Yeah, it's a weapon infusion now and they add a bit more ice stuff
[1:20:14] <cosmicgoatee> Kappa Expel orb
[1:20:19] <%beetus_unlimited> deadbu7Clout
[1:20:27] <Zombrocom> Only new ice spell is Blizzard, right?
[1:20:27] <$NirvashTypeMQ> wat song is this
[1:20:28] <+lethallylactic> They also added more Earth Magic.
[1:20:30] <Personified134> if you infuse the crab claws with ice it'll use the frosty crab model from ashes of ariandel
[1:20:30] <%arcaderabbit48> Alright, sounds like some stuff was added at least. Thanks all
[1:20:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @Personified134 Okay, that's awesome. I really appreciate that

[1:23:13] <%DappercatEsquire> So they're taking Denuvo our of Doom Eternal, but kinda exposed their balls a bit by saying it was all id's idea, not Bethesda's.

[1:24:14] <%FacetiousAF> dark souls, but with glimmer
[1:24:14] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt You should go back to high wall at some point to kill the evil knight man at the bottom of the elevator near Greirat, he drops something really sick
[1:24:19] <Zombrocom> Just her daggers I think
[1:24:20] <%DappercatEsquire> How far are we from plague doctor masks making a comeback?

[1:25:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Put your baby on the lag switch
[1:25:30] <TheArrow_> if you lose, say that your baby was the one on the stick
[1:25:30] <Personified134> The optimal use for your baby is for johns when you lose

[1:31:26] <+OwlLightningMage> it actually sucks because of the high investment
[1:31:29] <+Erimos> YOOOO

[1:31:31] <%arcaderabbit48> @RetroCop87 Remixed items and enemies. The items and weapons they added so have some story blurbs and lore, but nothing too out there like Daughters of Ash

[1:32:29] <Personified134> @MonsieurZero you can infuse it in the mod though so it works fine for faith builds
[1:32:34] <+lethallylactic> Chest next to the other one Pat
[1:32:36] <BliVru> @patstaresat best Faith weapon is Moonlight Greatsword with blessed infusion

[1:33:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Mimic condoms are top tier
[1:33:21] <Zombrocom> and catalysts and bows and such
[1:33:22] <+Erimos> The abyss runneth deep.
[1:33:25] <%WhereIsWill> drowning in the psaBig puss
[1:33:26] <Personified134> fragments are for spell catalyst upgrades/covenants
[1:33:27] <Treuan> Mimic what now
[1:33:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> two hand them
[1:33:35] <Zombrocom> Two chests even
[1:33:36] <%holydeviant1> Fragments say they can be used to enhance dark weapons and pyromancies

[1:34:12] <Chimeraelite> oh btw Corrupted Gundyr is a fucking great fight. Beat him first try with the Crypt Blacksword. Goddamn it's chonky
[1:34:13] <%holydeviant1> "I'd love to teach you but the book won't sit still!"

[1:34:41] <%DedlokPM> @DeaconBluesClues If the chain is curled towards with the chain pointing to the back, it is a normal chest, if the chain is curled pointing to the front it is a mimic
[1:34:41] <+GenesisKnight> Now you must survive... EVILLAK!
[1:34:43] <jhonxiolonn> like it should have been
[1:34:43] <Zombrocom> @DXLelouch24 It's on one of the roofs surrounding the pit where the winged knight patrols

[1:36:07] <%DedlokPM> @DeaconBluesClues In Dark Souls 2 though, you can tell by looking to see if the chest has an actual lock on it for wood chests or pieces of metal on the band parts of metal chests

[1:36:16] <lomack42> You might not like it but this is peak gaming
[1:36:17] <Zombrocom> Where those crossbow dudes were
[1:36:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> Wow Pat you really don't remember anything do you
[1:36:39] <%realm_forge> Don’t not go where you’re not going to be
[1:36:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> be nice to Pat. He has soft brains.
[1:36:41] <Dr_Suddenboner> excuses
[1:36:43] <%Axellogic> Yeah like dark souls
[1:36:44] <%holydeviant1> Seeing 27k souls is like seeing 10% charge on a phone screenshot
[1:36:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The hat obscures his eyesight and also brain
[1:36:44] <fuji_92> Pat really has Paige's memory
[1:36:46] <tommynocturnal> Keepin it fresh
[1:36:47] <%thelonechris> Mostly nothing
[1:36:47] <%heartlesshealer> and also Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[1:36:47] <%WhereIsWill> especially about massages WutFace
[1:36:49] <%DappercatEsquire> Empty your mind, Pat. Feel the Dark Souls flow through you.
[1:36:50] <%Axellogic> And dark souls 2
[1:36:50] <theloganbrand> mind full of dumb star trek lore
[1:36:55] <pennykettle_> you know esoteric facts? Name them all
[1:36:56] <Dr_Suddenboner> that guy got fucked up
[1:36:57] <+Erimos> That weapon is rad.
[1:36:57] <Personified134> check htat weapon out its neat
[1:36:59] <ammobasket> approximate knowledge of specific things
[1:37:01] <Zombrocom> Spear
[1:37:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Faith spea\r
[1:37:02] <Personified134> its a spear
[1:37:02] <%realm_forge> And goblins
[1:37:03] <%Axellogic> and Dark Souls Sotfs and even DS3
[1:37:05] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey Pat, sorry if you've been asked this but have you tried Stellaris?
[1:37:06] <%arancet> also he has to listen to paige every day, that sprads her brain holes
[1:37:08] <heybenice> Quick give us a random fact
[1:37:18] <%D00msDayDan> everybody get out of the goddamn way, you've got a hat full of bomb, a fist full of penis, and a head full of empty
[1:37:20] <Personified134> big faith spear
[1:37:21] <%TheWinged7> coronal cascade? oh no
[1:37:22] <%edwardskacz> look at those stat reqs
[1:37:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You're suppose to be the Souls Boy! Namco Bandai tweeted you!!
[1:37:24] <%Deft_Thought> Yoooo, they brought back Istarelle? I was a fan of that in Demon's
[1:37:24] <sendart> demon souls
[1:37:24] <+GenesisKnight> gnarly looking
[1:37:26] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[1:37:26] <tommynocturnal> Or vague enough to be played again for enjoyment
[1:37:27] <%arcaderabbit48> I cant really blame Pat. I feel like this game left the weakest lasting impression. DS1 and 2 I've got memorized, but this game is just kind of one long grey, brown blur
[1:37:27] <%YakumoYomi> Are you planning to use any pyromancy, since you're leveling both magic stats for dark magic?
[1:37:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's from DeS
[1:37:30] <Zombrocom> DeS weapon
[1:37:34] <%DappercatEsquire> It's a zig zag poke hurter
[1:37:35] <fuji_92> DeS
[1:37:38] <%DedlokPM> It was always there teenJOY
[1:37:38] <%Axellogic> Water is made of a compound of hydrogen and oxygen
[1:37:44] <Personified134> he will probably use some dark pyromancies
[1:37:48] <%heartlesshealer> demon soul weapon
[1:37:53] <+Erimos> You get a machine gun for its weapon art.
[1:37:55] <skyentombment> WOH! That's a big hat
[1:37:56] <%holydeviant1> Dark pyros are alright
[1:37:59] <Personified134> wolnir has some sick ones
[1:38:01] <+OwlLightningMage> @justanothertrapartist He tried to play it but the text was too small for him to read on his TV
[1:38:05] <%holydeviant1> One of them is a big shotgun
[1:38:08] <terribleusername> pew pew
[1:38:10] <%FacetiousAF> is there like a dark flamethrower?
[1:38:15] <%baroodybaby> Hey pat where did you get your cool cube that you use for pc gaming?
[1:38:16] <%DedlokPM> @skyentombment they call him Big Hat Pat
[1:38:19] <Personified134> unfortunately there is not a dark flamethrower
[1:38:23] <%heartlesshealer> the lake of shit
[1:38:27] <supergoblinpunch> I bet they regret not toilet training those Giants.
[1:38:31] <Dr_Suddenboner> i often find myself thinking that pyromancy is less interesting than dark sorcery
[1:38:32] <jhonxiolonn> boss spells is where it's at
[1:38:32] <rafaelba93> dark fireball is great tho
[1:38:36] <15zelda1> hey pat are you cheesing the shit out of this game
[1:38:40] <BlacSoul> CUBE
[1:38:40] <%dekkitout> The couchmaster?
[1:38:41] <%FacetiousAF> Couchmaster of some sort
[1:38:42] <%baroodybaby> hell yeah
[1:38:46] <%FacetiousAF> i think there's two couchmaster types
[1:38:49] <%baroodybaby> thanks dad
[1:38:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Couchmaster
[1:38:54] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @OwlLightningMage Ahh yeah that's fair, there's some UI mods that help but he's digging endless space which should scratch the itch
[1:39:00] <%heartlesshealer> all waters have been unslowed, neat
[1:39:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> The whole "you can use any dark spell with this catalyst" thing makes it really easy to use dark pyromancies, since you don't need to swap to a flame
[1:39:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't lie, you obtained the CUBE via dark ritual
[1:39:07] <LSpiral> so what did I miss in the last 30 minutes
[1:39:07] <%Madbearv> just be giant dad pat
[1:39:08] <%beetus_unlimited> The Cube
[1:39:10] <+lethallylactic> Kirk time
[1:39:16] <Zombrocom> Good ol Middlefinger Kirk
[1:39:19] <rafaelba93> pat, try the dark fireball karla sells
[1:39:37] <%arcaderabbit48> That Cube is made from someone's bones and soul
[1:39:41] <%YakumoYomi> There's some crazy ass Dark sorceries and miracles added in this mod.
[1:39:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> stellaris is honestly pretty different from endless space and other MOO style 4x games anyway
[1:39:49] <%holydeviant1> Quick note @PatStaresAt not all sets have the same bonus across all pieces
[1:39:54] <+GenesisKnight> big doors for big peeps
[1:39:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> big doors, or small man
[1:39:55] <terribleusername> big doors for a big hat
[1:39:55] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Dark Fireball will blow open any shield in the game
[1:39:57] <sinister_dexter> big fuckin doors
[1:39:58] <%holydeviant1> The starter for the outcast has bleed gloves
[1:39:58] <CaptainSharkFace> Nice knockers
[1:39:59] <rafaelba93> it shoots fast
[1:39:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat thinks Bolder Heave is bad LUL
[1:40:02] <CaptainSharkFace> sleepiLUL
[1:40:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> its a hybrid between traditional 4X and paradox's usual strategy games
[1:40:04] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt they go along well with your big hat
[1:40:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good dodging
[1:40:09] <Personified134> F
[1:40:10] <+spinalwizard> Big ol' Honkin' Door
[1:40:13] <%heartlesshealer> Some sets have different bonuses per piece
[1:40:15] <heybenice> Hunter x hunter doors
[1:40:18] <%DedlokPM> Out of Sunny D
[1:40:18] <%holydeviant1> SHINY BOY

[1:40:23] <Zombrocom> Rip
[1:40:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> riPepperonis

[1:40:27] <%dekkitout> In the dirt you go
[1:40:30] <rafaelba93> fireball has high rof
[1:40:30] <%heartlesshealer> bonkin
[1:40:31] <LSpiral> I'm currently doing base pyromancy in my cinders run, thinking about going pyro/miracle hybrid with the holy flame catalyst
[1:40:36] <Dr_Suddenboner> yeeted
[1:40:36] <+mrredwednesday> sbfpUno
[1:40:36] <$Blitz_king01> Shield Bopped
[1:40:37] <%WhereIsWill> pat got bonked
[1:40:44] <%Garthunox> what's bonkin
[1:40:56] <%MechArch> short red head get bonked
[1:40:58] <%DedlokPM> sunny d restocked
[1:41:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how's the fist weapons in this mod
[1:41:06] <%cureneckbeard> bonk!
[1:41:07] <pennykettle_> I want to do a Solaire build where I heal him, but hes just too strong to begin with
[1:41:30] <DXLelouch24> @sphincter_spelunker viable
[1:41:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sweet
[1:41:43] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat settle a bet, Balthier is the main character of FF12 right?
[1:41:51] <%heartlesshealer> someone mentioned starting as Brawler with a spinning back kick in this mod
[1:41:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> @LSpiral for pyro do you want to level both int/faith equally, or can you focus on one? I never ran it in vanilla DS3 let alone in a mod
[1:41:55] <pennykettle_> this mod also has bloodborne-tier visual transformations
[1:41:56] <%Valdorick> 100% is
[1:41:59] <%Garthunox> I did
[1:42:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Either him or Ashe
[1:42:00] <jhonxiolonn> @pennykettle_ Start in new game plus
[1:42:01] <%SharkMissile> 100% Correct
[1:42:02] <+Quinn_Carter> I thought Ashe was the main character
[1:42:06] <%joylent_blue> he's the leading man!
[1:42:07] <%Valdorick> That is Ashe and Baltheir's story.
[1:42:07] <%LaughingCatt> i mean he says so himself
[1:42:08] <Zombrocom> The problem with dark magic builds is everything resists dark
[1:42:10] <%holydeviant1> Balthier is also jjust cooler
[1:42:12] <%FacetiousAF> balthier is the real protag like bruno in jojo part 5
[1:42:13] <%coreyyotto> Wasn't it actually supposed to Basch?
[1:42:13] <pennykettle_> jhonxiolonn mmmmm didnt think of that
[1:42:19] <%SharkMissile> Fran is the main character of my bo...heart
[1:42:20] <%Garthunox> my friend says its Vaan
[1:42:27] <%SharkMissile> Your friend is wrong and dumb
[1:42:27] <%Deft_Thought> Basch is a semi-protag
[1:42:29] <jhonxiolonn> @pennykettle_ Then you'll wish he was stronger fdsh
[1:42:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Using a dark build on Midir is just asking for sadness
[1:42:31] <%Valdorick> Vaan was LITERALLY NOT SUPPOSE TO BE IN THE GAME
[1:42:33] <Personified134> At least we can all agree that its not fucking Penelo
[1:42:35] <%Sausious> Vaan;'s the one with the TT card in 14
[1:42:35] <Dr_Suddenboner> what about basch
[1:42:36] <+dmtjinni> quiet stream today
[1:42:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought Squall was the main character of all the Final Fantasy games I didn't play.
[1:42:44] <+dmtjinni> we need page
[1:42:45] <%Garthunox> Ashe or Basch
[1:42:46] <supergoblinpunch> Vaan is C3PO
[1:42:46] <%Nobrev> balthier is the LEADING MAN
[1:42:46] <+GenesisKnight> Vaan is the 4th choice for MC
[1:42:46] <%Metballs> Vaan is 5 out of 6
[1:42:46] <%Deft_Thought> A lot more of the game plot is about Balthier and Ashe
[1:42:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Garthunox I'm playing through FF12 right now and that's dumb
[1:42:47] <%joylent_blue> vaan was a FOCUS GROUP character
[1:42:51] <%thelonechris> His dick
[1:42:53] <%Piemen99> IN THE DICK
[1:42:56] <%holydeviant1> GET IM HIN THE DYICK
[1:42:56] <%coreyyotto> Even Penelo has more claim to MC than Vaan
[1:42:57] <Manwad> weak wrists
[1:42:57] <%CalderGaming> the OOOOL DICKTWIST
[1:42:57] <j0ustar> you can rip out vaan from that game and literally nothing changes.
[1:43:00] <%dekkitout> Stabbing is everyone's weakness
[1:43:02] <%Metballs> He's the player character, but not the main character
[1:43:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> His weakness is backstabs
[1:43:03] <Dr_Suddenboner> @supergoblinpunch LUL
[1:43:03] <%heartlesshealer> Vaan is aerosmith
[1:43:05] <%Valdorick> Vaan was added because of MARKETING
[1:43:08] <Personified134> Vaan absolutely changes things
[1:43:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Vaan and Pinello having nothing to do contributed to me stopping playing that back in the day
[1:43:09] <%Piemen99> THE OL DICK STAB
[1:43:09] <ShichiNoBushi> The game designers might say it's Vaan, but anything else would say Balthier or Ashe.
[1:43:11] <%schlager087> Is Fran the bunny girl?
[1:43:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave can break guards
[1:43:14] <+Quinn_Carter> How good is this mod compared to vanilla Dark Souls 3?
[1:43:17] <+Erimos> @PatStaresAt don't forget to ember up
[1:43:20] <skyentombment> oh , that's right, has coffee machine gone brr yet?
[1:43:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @schlager087 ye
[1:43:21] <%schlager087> cause if so i'm pretty sure that's the hero
[1:43:23] <pennykettle_> leagues better @Quinn_Carter
[1:43:25] <heybenice> Getting stabbed through the stomach is my weakness too
[1:43:25] <%joylent_blue> yes Fran is the sexy bunny chewbacca
[1:43:27] <LSpiral> @aWanderingKaivo I've never touched pyromancy in any of the dark souls games vanilla, this mod run is the first time I've ever messed with it, so idk
[1:43:30] <j0ustar> I wAnT tO bE a SkY pIrAtE
[1:43:30] <%Garthunox> Vaan is "the fool" the person in world who knows nothing so plot and stuff can get explained to him
[1:43:30] <%holydeviant1> Balthier/Han Solo and Fran/Chewie
[1:43:32] <Personified134> Vaan is a primary catalyst for Ashe's character development chat you're not remembering things well
[1:43:41] <%Garthunox> and thus, to us
[1:43:43] <+lostdayz9> grab his dick and twist it
[1:43:45] <jhonxiolonn> i just want pat to have more spells
[1:43:46] <+Quinn_Carter> I'm thinking about getting the Dark souls trilogy just to play these mods.
[1:43:47] <%Nobrev> vaan is the audience but the story is definitely about balthier, ashe, and basch
[1:43:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Pyro was also strong in all the games
[1:43:48] <Dr_Suddenboner> nae
[1:43:49] <%schlager087> @joylent_blue if that doesn't scream "Hero of the story" i don't know what does
[1:43:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh so Vaan is the Ryuji
[1:43:51] <tommynocturnal> Fran probably smells like pellets
[1:44:04] <%Garthunox> @sphincter_spelunker kg
[1:44:05] <Dr_Suddenboner> he's bonking again
[1:44:08] <%Garthunox> oops
[1:44:09] <%FacetiousAF> fran probably smells like whatever the feet weirdos are into
[1:44:11] <%holydeviant1> I like Fran for the accent
[1:44:12] <pennykettle_> I hope Cinders gives Wolnir 30 more bracelets
[1:44:16] <%Caidezes> This mod's awesome and it's not even "finished" yet.
[1:44:17] <%Garthunox> no sphincter, hes not
[1:44:19] <Personified134> Frans accent is absurdly sexy
[1:44:20] <%SharkMissile> I like Fran for the lingerie.
[1:44:27] <%heartlesshealer> So then you're saying Vaan is the Passione to Ashe's Giorno?
[1:44:29] <%Nobrev> fran can step on me
[1:44:29] <tommynocturnal> Haha
[1:44:31] <%heartlesshealer> what
[1:44:31] <rafaelba93> where can you get the insanity catalys?
[1:44:32] <Dr_Suddenboner> sexy
[1:44:34] <+nekodelic> @sphincter_spelunker yeah, but if Ryuji was the player character
[1:44:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Lspiral at least we can infinitely respec in cinders so no worry of messing up
[1:44:35] <%Nobrev> nordic
[1:44:37] <+Partialrecall2> stream quality is through the roof, this looks beautiful
[1:44:39] <terribleusername> like bjork?
[1:44:40] <gatdammit> Did he fight the creepy priest crew yet?
[1:44:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I only know bunny lady from 12
[1:44:44] <+Sargon1stClass> She def sounds like Bjork
[1:44:48] <%FacetiousAF> i like fran for the big penis i get
[1:44:48] <jhonxiolonn> FF 12 stream when
[1:44:52] <%Garthunox> fun fact, Biggs and Balthier are the same VA
[1:44:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Missed the push notification but I was on Twitch anyways doodGood
[1:45:00] <j0ustar> If Vaan and Penello weren't in that game I bet it would have had a more cohesive, centered story
[1:45:04] <zamzoph> Fran does kind of sound like Sigur Ros 🤔
[1:45:09] <worldbrand> LUL
[1:45:13] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:45:13] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt FF12 got a mod that was actually kinda similar to this you should stream it bitch
[1:45:13] <%heartlesshealer> camera foibles LUL
[1:45:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Lightning is the best FF character. Weren't you guys happy when she returned Kappa
[1:45:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> pat's scared of his own shadow
[1:45:14] <%Caidezes> LUL
[1:45:15] <%joylent_blue> Garthunox so Biggs was the leading man all along
[1:45:16] <%Nobrev> I have a ps2 copy of ff12 signed by gideon emery
[1:45:16] <%holydeviant1> SPOOKED BY A CANDLE
[1:45:18] <terribleusername> it was the wall brazier
[1:45:26] <%Garthunox> @nobrev yo that's dope
[1:45:29] <%arcaderabbit48> They're worshiping a lake, and also cannibalism
[1:45:38] <+Quinn_Carter> When it comes to this mod on Dark Souls 2, should I get vanilla or Scholar of the First Sin?
[1:45:39] <tommynocturnal> She was the only one i liked. Shes like chewbacca
[1:45:42] <+OwlLightningMage> I was so happy to see Lightning Return I clapped when I saw it Kappa
[1:45:43] <%WhereIsWill> I'm guessing were not getting an outlast 2 stream from pat anytime soon LUL
[1:45:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Google is getting a bit too specific with the news articles it shows me, just got one for this mod
[1:45:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> scholar
[1:45:51] <pennykettle_> oh heads up they added the crying and baby squashing noises back into the Oceiros fight
[1:45:53] <jazzygrooves> i have a ps2 copy of FF12 i found at a goodwill that has an OWO on it and doesnt work LUL
[1:45:59] <%Garthunox> @owllightningmage ok no legit the ff13 trilogy is a guilty pleasure of mine, it's such trash but omg I love it
[1:46:00] <%holydeviant1> I love this bonfire
[1:46:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> FF12 is a rad game and I'm glad to be playing it right now
[1:46:19] <%schlager087> ff12 better on switch or steam?
[1:46:23] <%holydeviant1> It's not just shortcut porn but a shortcut orgy
[1:46:23] <+nekodelic> @sphincter_spelunker and also, Vaan is less of the "funny man" type of character compared to Ryuji iirc
[1:46:23] <RubberFistFight> @pennykettle_ the crying is always there during the second phase. "My dear little Ocelotte. Where are you hiding?"
[1:46:24] <%Garthunox> @valentinius_anodyne I'm making my way through x-2 then I'm going back to 12
[1:46:25] <Dr_Suddenboner> blessing
[1:46:27] <Personified134> @holydeviant1 steam
[1:46:29] <%WhereIsWill> Darkmoon waifu
[1:46:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gotcha
[1:46:34] <Dr_Suddenboner> nice cape loser
[1:46:34] <MonsieurZero> is Yoel still alive?
[1:46:35] <+OwlLightningMage> You help her not die
[1:46:37] <Personified134> its overprised on both though
[1:46:37] <Zombrocom> Nothing yet
[1:46:41] <%MonsieurHedge> dont be a darkwraith and help her out on the bridge to Irithyll
[1:46:42] <VJdarkworld> dont be a menace
[1:46:44] <%Sausious> it's her dad in the greatwood hole isn't it?
[1:46:45] <%Anri02> Hey Pat
[1:46:46] <+Erimos> Once you get to Irityll, yes.
[1:46:47] <LSpiral> the quest is probably different in the mod
[1:46:49] <Zombrocom> Later on she summons you to fight creighton
[1:46:51] <pennykettle_> @RubberFistFight his voice is as cool as Sam Hayden
[1:46:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @schlager087 The Switch exclusive stuff got patched in to PC so PC
[1:46:53] <%weissguard> Don't you have to go to her world on the bridge that's on the way into Irithyll?
[1:46:54] <+Calern> i fucked it up by giving a tongue to Rosaria so i just fucken killed her
[1:46:54] <davey0000> After Catacombs theres a summon going into Irithyl I think
[1:46:56] <%Garthunox> @sausious grandad
[1:46:57] <+TheBitingIrish> Can you do it without fucking up the Dark ending?
[1:46:59] <%joylent_blue> i think i bounced off FF12 back on first release because my dumb baby brain couldn't understand gambits

[1:47:35] <davey0000> Not until Sirrus is done
[1:47:36] <+superkeaton> Yes
[1:47:37] <VJdarkworld> Applause
[1:47:38] <%MonsieurHedge> no but you can do his AFTER you do hers
[1:47:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Yes
[1:47:38] <+Erimos> big NO
[1:47:39] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt No, you have to do sirrus first
[1:47:41] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Do hers first
[1:47:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> there's evil out there, and there's evil within too
[1:47:43] <ashbirds> you have to do sirris' first
[1:47:46] <%Caidezes> Not in the vanilla game at least.
[1:47:48] <+superkeaton> You can get the items he wants in the overworld
[1:47:49] <jhonxiolonn> Yeah
[1:47:49] <%MonsieurHedge> he will sit there and wait forever
[1:47:50] <Scrub_Seeker> not simultaneously but you can do sirris first then him
[1:47:52] <sinister_dexter> this guy has a quest?
[1:47:54] <+Calern> Sirris goes hostile if you rank up rosaria
[1:47:54] <+superkeaton> Just don;t give fingers to rosaria
[1:47:55] <+dmtjinni> @jhonxiolonn @Erimos it is really scary but cool and fun
[1:47:59] <%Deft_Thought> I love Bloodborne Man's armor
[1:48:00] <%dekkitout> @CalderGaming Show her Emergence to gain Dark sorceries Kappa
[1:48:02] <%Deft_Thought> Looks great
[1:48:04] <gatdammit> dont you just kill him in his quest?
[1:48:12] <davey0000> Lightning Arrow being available so early is a game changer for Paladin builds man
[1:48:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @schlager087 Sorta. I think the only big thing was the ability to respec license boards
[1:48:16] <RevenantJoy> The moment you join the fingers you'll lock out Sirris' quest
[1:48:18] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt you should check out hands of god's moveset
[1:48:21] <%Laecerelius> EDGE!
[1:48:22] <%DappercatEsquire> Absyssal Edging
[1:48:22] <Personified134> ABYSSAL EDGE
[1:48:26] <%CalderGaming> @TheBitingIrish sure, they come in prose format sometimes
[1:48:27] <pennykettle_> where is the ring to summon her? I didnt find it in my game
[1:48:27] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Make sure to fully exhust her dialogue. You know youre done when she gives her a gesture
[1:48:29] <Gameaholic42> Yes, just binge this guy's quest out at the end of the game
[1:48:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave is all you need
[1:48:29] <PrimordialDonut> abyssal edge is great
[1:48:31] <%weissguard> Edge. Edge. undo
[1:48:31] <MonsieurZero> ow the edge
[1:48:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> abyssal edge for the chuuni
[1:48:31] <%joylent_blue> e d g e
[1:48:33] <+Quinn_Carter> GIVE YOURSELF TO THE EDGE doodNuts
[1:48:33] <jhonxiolonn> oh nice
[1:48:33] <%nmaten> my dregs are yearning
[1:48:35] <%dekkitout> D E E P
[1:48:35] <VJdarkworld> putting on the rosaria covenant badge is what causes sirris to hate you in regular game. no clue what cinders adds to it
[1:48:35] <+GenesisKnight> The Dahk Arts
[1:48:35] <+firmlygraspi1> Urine Dregs
[1:48:39] <%schlager087> @Valentinius_Anodyne that's still dope, thanks for the heads up man
[1:48:39] <Zombrocom> Abyssal Edge is sick
[1:48:41] <%FacetiousAF> i want all of those psaGib
[1:48:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave will make them bleed
[1:48:41] <ashbirds> you can join rosaria but you can't click the pledge loyalty option or it fucks up sirris
[1:48:42] <%WhereIsWill> great deep N U T
[1:48:43] <fuji_92> CATHERINE ANNOUNCER: EDGE!
[1:48:47] <+Promessa_EX> reminds me of the edgiest ace combat name, abyssal dision
[1:48:50] <jhonxiolonn> Great deep soul of the abyss
[1:48:50] <nademonkey1100> those names are metal as fuck
[1:48:51] <Zombrocom> Abyssal edge is just old Dark Edge but good
[1:48:52] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt Greirat will never pillage, he just gets new items automatically with boss kills
[1:48:55] <tommynocturnal> These dregs aint loyal
[1:48:55] <katocrimson> go look for patches
[1:48:59] <%Garthunox> Any good JRPGs left to come out this year?
[1:49:01] <+TheBitingIrish> @CalderGaming Wouldn't that be fanfiction then?
[1:49:05] <%YakumoYomi> Abyssal Edge seems to be similar to what Dark Edge was in vanilla DS3, but faster.
[1:49:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave is broken as fuck. Bolder Heave is the best upchuck
[1:49:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> No more going off to die in Lothric
[1:49:15] <pennykettle_> Save Greirat is the Save Aerith of our times
[1:49:16] <+lethallylactic> Miralda gear
[1:49:17] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt It broke too easily with sequence breaking so they just got rid of it
[1:49:18] <davey0000> I don't know if he even dies anymore
[1:49:21] <pitsuji> Greirat buffs
[1:49:24] <%Deft_Thought> Protecc the Rat BlessRNG
[1:49:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark Edge was so fucking terrible LUL
[1:49:29] <DXLelouch24> He doesnt die
[1:49:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Is the Dark Hand unnerfed in this?
[1:49:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Makes sense
[1:49:46] <%CalderGaming> @TheBitingIrish all doujin really means is "independent works" so yeah it can be fanfiction
[1:49:55] <PrimordialDonut> yearning dregs is dope too
[1:49:57] <Zombrocom> Great. Deep. Soul.
[1:49:58] <Monkeyweed21> talk to Yol
[1:50:00] <%holydeviant1> The greatest doujin energy is touhou
[1:50:01] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark Edge is the opposite of Bolder Heave in usefulness
[1:50:04] <tommynocturnal> Good to know
[1:50:08] <BliVru> @patstaresat But Orbeck can still LEAVE if you sequence break
[1:50:10] <%dekkitout> Oh Huevo-kun, papa's learned more magics~
[1:50:21] <%FacetiousAF> numbers go up PogChamp
[1:50:21] <+GenesisKnight> Hayai
[1:50:23] <%Laecerelius> Chonk!
[1:50:24] <jhonxiolonn> The magic teacher has an armor that makes your steps silent
[1:50:25] <%Quigsies> I like em big
[1:50:27] <%WhereIsWill> is a lightning fist build str/faith?
[1:50:27] <%Deft_Thought> Extra THICC even
[1:50:27] <Zombrocom> Chunck
[1:50:32] <+TheBitingIrish> CAMPBELLS Chunky
[1:50:43] <%Laecerelius> Wow
[1:50:47] <%dekkitout> PHUCK
[1:50:47] <PrimordialDonut> RIGHT?!
[1:50:48] <%FacetiousAF> jesus tits
[1:50:48] <%Anri02> That was a lot of damage
[1:50:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @schlager087 Just remembered, the other formerly Switch exclusive thing was the ability to have three different Gambit presets, if you're curious
[1:50:52] <%weissguard> It is slower though.
[1:50:52] <pennykettle_> solaire will go ham on this guy
[1:50:53] <+Erimos> THAT'S RAD
[1:50:53] <+GenesisKnight> Big swing
[1:50:54] <Zombrocom> Good old Dark Edge but buffed!
[1:50:55] <+firmlygraspi1> big number Pog
[1:50:56] <BlacSoul> no combo
[1:50:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> That ain't no flashsword
[1:50:57] <+TheBitingIrish> But can you combo Abyssal?
[1:51:00] <%Laecerelius> Doesn't super chain, though
[1:51:00] <tommynocturnal> Yikes
[1:51:01] <Badgerconda_> THAT'S ALOTTA DAMAGE
[1:51:02] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt Abyssal edge is a vanilla spell with pumped numbers and a different name
[1:51:02] <davey0000> That's the base version of dark edge I think
[1:51:02] <%g0atmeal> You get something for killing the dummy btw
[1:51:03] <+OwlLightningMage> It's actually worth using now
[1:51:06] <%YakumoYomi> @holydeviant1 I agree, considering there's probably five times as many "doujin" Touhou games as official ones.
[1:51:06] <Monkeyweed21> Yol @PatStaresAt
[1:51:07] <+GenesisKnight> One is your light attack the other is your heavy
[1:51:08] <Badgerconda_> Someone get that skeleton some flexseal
[1:51:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> big number
[1:51:09] <jhonxiolonn> Oh, we big sword now
[1:51:12] <%Laecerelius> DO COMBO VS BIG NUMBER!
[1:51:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah its the heavy attack to dark edge's quick attack
[1:51:14] <davey0000> I think Dark Edge was that in vanilla
[1:51:15] <pitsuji> its a heavy attack
[1:51:17] <tolloponik> its a Combo Ender
[1:51:19] <jhonxiolonn> try to combo them
[1:51:24] <katocrimson> gs tcs
[1:51:25] <terribleusername> big combo vs big number
[1:51:26] <%WhereIsWill> it's like an heavy version
[1:51:27] <+OwlLightningMage> That's how it was in vanilla but slower and shitter
[1:51:30] <%Anri02> Even when pat chooses a magic build, he still gets the big sword
[1:51:33] <%YakumoYomi> That's definitely what vanilla Dark Edge was.
[1:51:38] <%schlager087> @Valentinius_Anodyne that's dope i'll have to get it when it's on sale
[1:51:41] <+Lost_Zombie> @PatStaresAt max your catalyst and it gains a pancake effect
[1:51:42] <BlacSoul> @jhonxiolonn he did, didnt work
[1:51:45] <TheyCallMeVawn> So how is this compared to base DS3
[1:51:48] <tommynocturnal> I know what i want 4 hannukah
[1:51:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Could go refight vordt real quick
[1:51:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave is still better
[1:51:57] <pennykettle_> I would love spells to work more like melee where you bind them to light and heavy
[1:52:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Unless they nerfed Bolder Heave in Cinders
[1:52:11] <Personified134> rip titanite
[1:52:12] <%FacetiousAF> 83?????
[1:52:22] <%holydeviant1> you get a lot of shards
[1:52:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> that would be really nice, not having to cycle through them on one button
[1:52:31] <davey0000> Titanite is super easy to get because they added like 40 new kinds of resources
[1:52:39] <Zombrocom> Eh, writhing deep kinda sucks IMO
[1:52:42] <davey0000> I got a Slab minute one my first run through
[1:52:55] <+lethallylactic> Just drop some embers tbh
[1:53:03] <tommynocturnal> I like chaos builds
[1:53:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt You could just go refight a boss real quick for 10k+
[1:53:05] <rubbersnake21> 2 souls aonlinJanemba
[1:53:11] <Zombrocom> Just go kill vordt
[1:53:17] <Zombrocom> It takes like 30 seconds
[1:53:18] <tommynocturnal> Those fists man
[1:53:20] <Personified134> ????????????????????
[1:53:22] <spoiledbadger> what
[1:53:34] <Personified134> PAT YOU ARE PLAYING A DARK BUILD @PatStaresAt
[1:53:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Your build is dark
[1:53:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> dark is totally pointless on a hex build?
[1:53:38] <Personified134> WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS POINTLESS
[1:53:38] <spoiledbadger> i suppose
[1:53:43] <%CrookedSpiral> wouldn't dark synergise?
[1:53:44] <+j_mac2> I like the hat
[1:53:46] <pennykettle_> Pat is there a conversion rate for forging soul items at bonfires
[1:53:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dark is useful for weapons because you're doing Hexes
[1:53:50] <nademonkey1100> about as easy as my ex girlfriend
[1:53:54] <%Typhaeon> Hey Patlikes, AKA Pat Souls
[1:54:00] <%Reveresao> BIG hat for little MAN
[1:54:06] <%YakumoYomi> I've missed the start of every Cinders stream thus far. Did Pat kill Corrupted Gundyr?
[1:54:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> makes sense
[1:54:10] <+GenesisKnight> Gotta have diverse damage types
[1:54:11] <%CrookedSpiral> fair
[1:54:13] <Chimeraelite> Also the material for the no hit runs (just beat Vordt no hit) are Primordial shards.
[1:54:14] <%Anri02> Embrace the dahkness
[1:54:16] <%dekkitout> But you'll look cool tho
[1:54:16] <%WhereIsWill> lot of enemies have dark resistance in ds3
[1:54:18] <Zombrocom> I just made a sword for every element
[1:54:18] <+Erimos> @YakumoYomi not yet
[1:54:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fair enough
[1:54:20] <%CrookedSpiral> diversify!
[1:54:23] <%dekkitout> So you got that goin for ya
[1:54:24] <spoiledbadger> you can use one for another backup weapon though
[1:54:25] <Monkeyweed21> then buy some spells cumbo
[1:54:27] <Zombrocom> It's a mine
[1:54:30] <RubberFistFight> here's a thought pat: you should play exactly how you want to play and no other way, because fuck chat. Kappa
[1:54:30] <+OwlLightningMage> That's still not a good reason to throw away dark materials
[1:54:32] <tommynocturnal> Strateeegeeee
[1:54:42] <%kiryuuva> wraxuBlank
[1:54:46] <jhonxiolonn> if it misses
[1:54:48] <davey0000> Isn't there an infusion that deals physical damage but scales with Dark similar to Holy?
[1:54:49] <Zombrocom> It's a landmine
[1:54:52] <%holydeviant1> Always keep two or more damage types
[1:54:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lingering flame like?
[1:54:53] <%optimasmaximas> is it like gnaw?
[1:54:54] <+OwlLightningMage> You weapon damage is better than spells when min maxed
[1:54:55] <%dekkitout> Linger
[1:54:58] <+Ashboldt> area denile
[1:54:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> it can be used as a mine, alright
[1:55:00] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> curse
[1:55:00] <jhonxiolonn> woh
[1:55:01] <%patriotrenegade> its like a landmine
[1:55:03] <%Typhaeon> Delayed Dark Bukkake
[1:55:04] <%CrookedSpiral> mine spell
[1:55:04] <+OwlLightningMage> garabge
[1:55:05] <%ArcanumMBD> gotta aim it at the ground and bait people into it
[1:55:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a mine
[1:55:06] <+Lost_Zombie> @PatStaresAt impact effect or a landmine
[1:55:08] <%Anri02> It's a magic mine thrower
[1:55:09] <+GenesisKnight> Does more damage if it explodes
[1:55:11] <%WhereIsWill> zone control
[1:55:16] <nuane> looks bad m8
[1:55:16] <pitsuji> can you shoot multiple
[1:55:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Throw that shit in the trash
[1:55:17] <Monkeyweed21> MINETHROWER BABY
[1:55:17] <jhonxiolonn> it has a lot of AOe
[1:55:17] <%Mr_Pylon> it trap
[1:55:19] <%trustycoyote> Meant to apply curse to a group of enemies @PatStaresAt
[1:55:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Seems kinda bad though
[1:55:22] <gatdammit> whack
[1:55:25] <%Aleate> Almost like its a creative spell ruuThink
[1:55:26] <rafaelba93> how did you unlock more karla's spells?
[1:55:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> I wonder if it explodes quicker if they walk into it?
[1:55:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Garabge garage trash trash
[1:55:45] <tommynocturnal> Pat u have big orb energy
[1:55:46] <%DensityD> boing boing
[1:55:51] <PrimordialDonut> do you plan on using the moonlight greatsword when you get it?
[1:55:51] <%ArcanumMBD> it's probably good if you're going pure magic and have to constantly kite an enemy
[1:55:51] <nhs64> how does his mp region so fast?
[1:55:51] <+OwlLightningMage> When's Bolder Heave
[1:55:52] <+Ashboldt> good if you're a kiter or scared of the world
[1:56:05] <%Typhaeon> Deep Barb from Deep Minnesota, gently chides your enemies for not being neighborly

[1:56:40] <davey0000> OG Dark Edge was always cool but kinda useless IIRC
[1:56:47] <huskarl_zap> chaos sorcerer pat
[1:56:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark Edge that doesn't suck is weird to see
[1:56:49] <tommynocturnal> Hey mikey i thinkk he likes it
[1:56:53] <Zombrocom> That spell was the only reason to play a dark mage in vanilla, shame it sucked in vanilla too LUL
[1:56:58] <%maenos2> worms
[1:57:01] <%kiryuuva> eww, leeches.
[1:57:03] <+Kataiser> Dark Edge has always been cool. Glad it's good now.

[1:59:33] <Scrub_Seeker> dont know but you can encounter him later for sieg's quest
[1:59:38] <tolloponik> it dose?
[1:59:39] <spoiledbadger> it did for me yeah
[1:59:39] <$zackalan> Yes/No/Maybe/Definitely KappaHD
[1:59:39] <+OwlLightningMage> Opening the shortcut door does
[1:59:42] <tommynocturnal> I always murder patches
[1:59:48] <huskarl_zap> ThunBeast
[1:59:49] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I think you can miss dialogue but never 100% break him
[1:59:52] <tusk_act4> The door is what deactivates him
[2:00:02] <gatdammit> Are you a cleric?
[2:00:09] <tusk_act4> The big ass one
[2:00:09] <%maenos2> hm I wonder, is patches in Sekiro?
[2:00:16] <Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Heyo hope youre gaving a good one
[2:00:16] <%maenos2> never saw if he was
[2:00:20] <nuane> it's ok I guess
[2:00:22] <+Erimos> if you don't find patches the typical way he'll just show up at firelink. don't know if that screws up sieg's quest though.

[2:01:07] <%heartlesshealer> proximity based damage and also he resists if you hit the head
[2:01:12] <tusk_act4> You can still do Sieg's quest. You just need to buy his armor off Patches after he arrives in Firelink.
[2:01:12] <davey0000> If you Kill Abyss before doing anything with Patches, that's when Sieg gets screwed over
[2:01:17] <%MonsieurHedge> you're not gonna do damage while he's curled up like tht
[2:01:17] <%patriotrenegade> maybe he has to be standing

[2:10:12] <%FacetiousAF> "finicky"
[2:10:14] <%heartlesshealer> The Onion fight was a funsies fight added into the mod
[2:10:16] <katocrimson> he was never in well when pat checked
[2:10:16] <gatdammit> get him plague
[2:10:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Didn't he actually fight Seig in the swamp?
[2:10:16] <CherrieVelvet> oops
[2:10:16] <nuane> (I don't actually know how this quest works im sorry)
[2:10:18] <sinister_dexter> rip patches
[2:10:19] <+Mitchellsocks> Nothing in DS3 is as bad as Sieg's DS1 quest
[2:10:19] <fatcrab> patches is deleting your save file right now
[2:10:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh
[2:10:20] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt just go back up
[2:10:21] <%heartlesshealer> Real Onion is alive
[2:10:21] <davey0000> You can get Patches at Firelink still, yeah
[2:10:24] <Treuan> At least in Vanilla, if you miss patches here he shows up at Firelink
[2:10:26] <+Erimos> Patches goes to firelink if you don't find him. Sieg is in the well right now.

[2:10:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> patches is reformating your hard drive
[2:10:34] <LSpiral> I would assume that the quests have been altered due to the sequence breaking nature of the mod
[2:10:34] <Sundaysmiles01> yeah, lets go beat the deac
[2:10:34] <+alex_id> Gwyn is dead
[2:10:34] <+Beruptor> Like DS1 quests were any less obtuse haha

[2:10:35] <tusk_act4> @PatStaresAt It's fine, even if you miss Patches here it just means you missed an optional scene
[2:10:35] <RubberFistFight> If you havent been into a specific area in Irythill yet he's fine
[2:10:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> You just missed patches Scamming you

[2:10:46] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You are fine killing boss just quit game and continue and he should be there
[2:10:46] <BlacSoul> Wont he leave after that?
[2:10:57] <RubberFistFight> all you gotta do is find him down the well, then meet patches and do his shit, then buy his armor later and give it back to siegward down the well.

[2:32:50] <jhonxiolonn> infuse infuse
[2:32:52] <%jamesvdv12> lol looks like a crusty ass minecraft sword
[2:33:01] <%Metballs> You ever going to clean up that inventory, buddy?
[2:33:01] <%TheREALGirthMan> Looks like a twisted dick ngl
[2:33:05] <NiftyNox> dork infusion
[2:33:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> now you can have sword, spell, and shield all without switching anything
[2:33:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> make it better
[2:33:09] <SaltyAzteca> Oh its like a broadsword? Thats cool, I never used it before
[2:33:09] <jhonxiolonn> you can infuse a shield and just use that
[2:33:10] <%QuadraticGravity> Dark Time!
[2:33:14] <+Pun1sher7313> so youre gonna fight with a menorah now? weird
[2:33:16] <Zombrocom> This thing had more spell buff at base than my +4 heretics staff
[2:33:18] <+GenesisKnight> Big darkness?
[2:33:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> should stack with staff buff, @PatStaresAt
[2:33:19] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:33:19] <+AppleBasket> dark is big damage on spells
[2:33:24] <%MonsieurHedge> dark for you
[2:33:29] <%trustycoyote> Enchanted is FP on hit, right? @PatStaresAt
[2:33:32] <%MonsieurHedge> its a mainhand with the blueblood as an offhand
[2:33:37] <SGrim> Sorcery stick seems good
[2:33:38] <%MonsieurHedge> or a sidearm i guess
[2:33:38] <jhonxiolonn> Dark is broken, actuallly
[2:33:44] <%FacetiousAF> sorcery stick sounds good.
[2:33:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> keep blueblood as a backup for dark resistant enemies?
[2:33:46] <KishinGrek> Candlestick is finally useful
[2:33:49] <%FacetiousAF> C scaling too
[2:33:50] <%heartlesshealer> then just enchanted maybe
[2:33:50] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Ah yes!
[2:33:51] <%WhereIsWill> enchanted cuz too many dark enemies
[2:33:53] <jhonxiolonn> GOOD
[2:33:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pizaganza is some next level calorie busting goodness available in Quebec, It's any large pizza with at least 2 inches of lazagna with extra cheese in it.
[2:33:54] <+lethallylactic> Good
[2:34:03] <spoiledbadger> i did fire
[2:34:04] <%MonsieurHedge> you want Dark
[2:34:04] <+AppleBasket> dark infusions will make you BLOW UP enemies with your dark spells
[2:34:06] <%QuadraticGravity> Dark is HP on hit, and I believe better int+faith scaling
[2:34:07] <Monkeyweed21> Blueblood offhand candlestick mainhand
[2:34:15] <%MonsieurHedge> you use blueblood for dark resistant and Candlestick for anyone else
[2:34:16] <%heartlesshealer> also put ice on your crab
[2:34:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> I don't miss needing to look up the "best" element for every weapon in the game
[2:34:25] <%TheREALGirthMan> Black me, Pat
[2:34:29] <%maenos2> butter on crab
[2:34:34] <worldbrand> hopy shit
[2:34:38] <%WhereIsWill> PogChamp
[2:34:40] <Monkeyweed21> Dual wield with blue blood
[2:34:41] <tjplat> LUL
[2:34:41] <%bevyrage> yo WHAT
[2:34:41] <spoiledbadger> yep
[2:34:43] <misterspotswood> bruh
[2:34:44] <$lotharrio> That's pretty good.
[2:34:47] <jhonxiolonn> i enchanted a knife with dark and i became a monster
[2:34:47] <+tweedler92> bluuhhhd
[2:34:50] <+superkeaton> so you absorb hp+fp on hit
[2:34:56] <DXLelouch24> Lifeste bois
[2:34:59] <Zlinnt> easy
[2:35:02] <+lethallylactic> If you're using it as a catalyst for dark spells, dark seems like the obvious choice. It can just replace the staff.
[2:35:07] <+nekodelic> infuse dark and dual weild with the other sword instead of staff?
[2:35:07] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Man I wish powerstancing was still a thing in DS3
[2:35:08] <DXLelouch24> Lifesteal bois*
[2:35:09] <SaltyAzteca> So itll steal a lot of HP from enemies eh?
[2:35:13] <%templar010> and its your catalyst so that should also apply to spells right?
[2:35:15] <spoiledbadger> yep
[2:35:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Life and Stamina steal ftw
[2:35:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt have you summoned solaire? He is super broken like 800 to 1k damage on his spears and 500 per swing of his sword, also I have tried to kill him within 60 seconds and even the ballista in the smouldering lake cant do enough damage
[2:35:28] <+lethallylactic> Multi-sword wielding!
[2:35:30] <%Caidezes> DUAL WIELD MAGIC AND DARK
[2:35:31] <%QuadraticGravity> put blueblood in offhand?
[2:35:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> so spellsword he has two swords
[2:35:34] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeeeee
[2:35:41] <+GenesisKnight> Your Kirito Cosplay is coming along
[2:35:41] <Aydarkzero> ???

[2:35:44] <Zombrocom> Swordest of Spellswords
[2:35:45] <spoiledbadger> yeah
[2:35:55] <RubberFistFight> @nekodelic living together in perfect harmony?
[2:35:57] <spoiledbadger> true
[2:35:57] <Monkeyweed21> Dark candlestick and magic blue blood
[2:36:05] <+AppleBasket> you have spare dark gems, can always change the infusion later
[2:36:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Candlestick in offhand?
[2:36:08] <+nekodelic> @rubberfistfight perfectly balanced
[2:36:13] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt you could put on the ring of momentum to turn the block into a dash
[2:36:18] <%QuadraticGravity> Enchanted adds physical w/ int scaling
[2:36:20] <%g0atmeal> Curse infusion multiplies weapon dmg infinitely with combos. If you want big number, that's the way to go.
[2:36:33] <wittoo2> At least it’s not candleja
[2:36:45] <$lotharrio> Man that ghost guy is really kind to hit enter.
[2:36:45] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Wait is candlestick good for dark sorceries?
[2:36:46] <ashbirds> blue blood has weirdly shit scaling on dark but A or something on lightning
[2:36:55] <+lethallylactic> LUL

[2:37:26] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> YOOOO
[2:37:27] <%LaughingCatt> thats some real damage
[2:37:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> "Dark's useless" Pat said
[2:37:29] <Augus7717> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[2:37:30] <+major_dude> yoooooo
[2:37:36] <%FacetiousAF> pat's gonna grind off stream Kappa
[2:37:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark is useless though
[2:37:38] <Ciglossonjr> Anyone else waiting for Humble Bundle to restock DS3 steam codes?
[2:37:38] <$Blitz_king01> REAL SOVIET DAMAGE!
[2:37:41] <%cureneckbeard> where's Paige
[2:37:45] <rekinom> Dark infusion made the fire go out on the candlestick @PatStaresAt
[2:37:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> just keep blue blood as a backup
[2:37:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Blueblood is still good for FP regen
[2:37:52] <%Caidezes> Your FP though.
[2:37:52] <jhonxiolonn> just hit with the candle stick
[2:37:53] <%Laecerelius> Time to get even more twinkling titanite!
[2:37:56] <LSpiral> Pat, start chucking shit innto your storage box
[2:38:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> We spellblading now
[2:38:06] <+AppleBasket> blueblood is a cool weapon to have backup though
[2:38:09] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Jesus Pat, put away those weapons you can't even use.
[2:38:11] <tommynocturnal> Jeezy creezy
[2:38:11] <$lotharrio> Yeah this is cleanup time.
[2:38:12] <+lethallylactic> Pat...
[2:38:20] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> clean your inventory
[2:38:21] <ashbirds> if you infuse a shield with Clarity it gives you more mana regen
[2:38:32] <ashbirds> Lucidity reduces spell FP consumption
[2:38:37] <spoiledbadger> yeah
[2:38:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Could left hand candlestick
[2:38:40] <Zombrocom> Doesn't the candlestick have the same moveset in both hands anyway?
[2:38:41] <jhonxiolonn> you can enchant a shield for fp purposes
[2:38:42] <spoiledbadger> that's waht i did
[2:38:45] <%jamesvdv12> does this new mod let you stack infusions?
[2:38:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> We need the Blue Flame
[2:38:46] <%heartlesshealer> leaving to do friend stuff online
[2:38:50] <+linSP> Pat is crammed af
[2:38:56] <%Laecerelius> Put candlestick in offhand?
[2:38:57] <%heartlesshealer> y'all have fun guiding and goading Pat
[2:39:03] <ashbirds> I did lucidity but I've been using the blue blood as my backup when mana goes down
[2:39:09] <%QuadraticGravity> @PatStaresAt Shield that lets you use the main-hand skill with L2, maybe? That spell buff is really strong.
[2:39:27] <%SpicyCheeseNips> >not maining blue blood
[2:39:29] <%QuadraticGravity> Noice
[2:39:37] <+AppleBasket> ^^^ SPELL DAMAGE UP ^^^
[2:39:37] <$lotharrio> Someone mentioned Fire and that makes sense to a degree. Since going all the way in one damage type is just asking for a bad time.
[2:39:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> blueblood's fp regen is nuts since it applies to each of its orb's hits
[2:39:42] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> uwu
[2:39:46] <%SpicyCheeseNips> also waaaat I didn't know the cleric stick did that
[2:39:46] <jhonxiolonn> yeah
[2:39:47] <rekinom> owo
[2:39:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Just so you know that weapon skill counts as a weapon buff, so it's overwritten by dark weapon and such
[2:40:03] <Zombrocom> Doesn't the candlestick have the same moveset in both hands anyway? Can just double sword
[2:40:08] <jhonxiolonn> cute
[2:40:31] <%trustycoyote> Nice!
[2:40:38] <%FacetiousAF> wait i was spacing out what's the shield for?
[2:40:44] <+AppleBasket> make the numbers go up
[2:40:45] <$lotharrio> I miss the Raiden cosplay
[2:40:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Looking cool, Patron

[2:41:30] <%trustycoyote> Well.... shit
[2:41:31] <+AppleBasket> it's OK, pat, the candlestick would have been OP anyways
[2:41:33] <%FacetiousAF> did he get the Deacons ring yet?
[2:41:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nope
[2:41:35] <+Mitchellsocks> It's the only boss weapon that doesn't
[2:41:38] <%g0atmeal> You mean titanite scales?
[2:41:39] <%SpicyCheeseNips> wait is it a boss weapon???
[2:41:39] <SaltyAzteca> OH WELL, JUST BUY 'EM

[2:41:56] <%QuadraticGravity> What was the question I was muted
[2:41:57] <+itsOnyxLeo> You made a classic blunder
[2:41:57] <%MonsieurHedge> it was originally dropped by the clerics
[2:42:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Dark Souls 3, why are you like this
[2:42:00] <+LTKonnor> It really do be like that sometimes
[2:42:02] <%WhereIsWill> get fucct
[2:42:03] <jhonxiolonn> Well, you won't be broken yet
[2:42:04] <Monkeyweed21> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:42:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> aren't stupid Souls upgrade problems great
[2:42:07] <%MonsieurHedge> but they cut that and made it the Deacon soul weapon
[2:42:11] <+AppleBasket> Blueblood is pretty damn good against dark resistant
[2:42:11] <$lotharrio> Very similar, yeah.
[2:42:16] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt It upgraded with normal titanite in vanilla LUL
[2:42:22] <Monkeyweed21> now get the ring
[2:42:34] <+AppleBasket> Pat, how much does your affinity do on the Stick?

[2:42:46] <+Mitchellsocks> Maxed out Crow claws on a sorcery build today, hated the DS3 rapier moveset, and now I'm all outta chunks
[2:42:49] <CherrieVelvet> the books?

[2:42:51] <+AppleBasket> you already built the nest
[2:42:51] <+wmeldrum> twigs
[2:42:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> also just think, its outdamaging blue blood at +0 compared to blueblood's +3
[2:42:51] <%aishman> It was the books dude
[2:42:53] <$lotharrio> Books already happened...
[2:42:54] <CherrieVelvet> oh no
[2:42:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> maybe one day they'll learn their lesson and make a system where you upgrade weapon class perks instead of gather rocks for individual items
[2:42:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> poop

[2:44:41] <%brackboi> What happend to peach? i hope shes okay
[2:44:44] <SmolBluGhost> dont be silly wrap your broccoli
[2:44:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> @bootysteve bonfire placement and some warp points but otherwise no afaik

[2:44:55] <Zombrocom> Time to find Kirk
[2:44:55] <%cureneckbeard> Did you remember to put paper towels down
[2:45:05] <+Lillowh> Did you pound her butt? Kappa
[2:45:05] <tacostarvedbeast> oh pat and his silly hats
[2:45:11] <ashbirds> weapon art for candlestick seems pretty lame so any shield really
[2:45:12] <sitruus> they were getting freaky
[2:45:15] <Scrub_Seeker> there are shields you can infuse that have passive FP regen so yeah
[2:45:19] <%g0atmeal> Havel's Kappa
[2:45:20] <%QuadraticGravity> Optimally you'd want something light enough to put you under a weight class
[2:45:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> the black knight shield you already have?
[2:45:28] <Zombrocom> Black knight shield? You have that right
[2:45:29] <koffeemancer> @brackboi Pat's ass groove on the couch hurt her lower back
[2:45:42] <+encrouched> Butt
[2:45:48] <%QuadraticGravity> I'll dig around for FP regen shields so you can make your own Grass Crest
[2:46:02] <%Teintstein> @koffeemancer it's like riding a fence
[2:46:05] <SaltyAzteca> That health regain is so small
[2:46:08] <ashbirds> there's a small shield that gives you +10% max stamina that's pretty dope if you don't care about blocking
[2:46:22] <Sundaysmiles01> I just got back, how badly did Pat fuckup progress?
[2:46:22] <%brackboi> @koffeemancer your.. your jokin right?
[2:46:23] <tommynocturnal> Irradiated butt rooves are the worst
[2:46:26] <Hellarussian> why is Pat desecrating a holy sanctum?
[2:46:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah it doesn't apply to spells though

[2:46:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @brackboi kind of. She really hurt her back from all the slouching she does on her side of the couch

[2:48:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kirk needs your humanity for the fair lady
[2:48:34] <SaltyAzteca> That parry fail
[2:48:36] <$lotharrio> It's a pretty solid R2
[2:48:40] <%SpicyCheeseNips> wait THATS your R2??
[2:48:43] <%possumwalsh1221> The tracking on that overhead sword magic is WILD
[2:48:44] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I thought that was a spell...
[2:48:46] <tommynocturnal> Darkness is spreading!
[2:48:51] <%QuadraticGravity> yeah but you're not blocking
[2:48:55] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Ya same

[2:49:05] <$lotharrio> Oh did they fix shield upgrading?
[2:49:08] <theresnodiee> It is a spell
[2:49:09] <%DappercatEsquire> @worldbrand block to regain health
[2:49:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> haha dark go fwom
[2:49:12] <+AppleBasket> I really like that the candle weaponart actually lights the candles
[2:49:18] <%DedlokPM> @worldbrand you heard him. Or higher.
[2:49:20] <+major_dude> crest gives stamina regen tho
[2:49:23] <jhonxiolonn> 110% makes you heal on block
[2:49:28] <%possumwalsh1221> I never used magic in vanilla how impossible is this build not in cinders?
[2:49:33] <tacostarvedbeast> is this the one that has the blue blood sword put into it?
[2:49:37] <%QuadraticGravity> @possumwalsh1221 painful.
[2:49:42] <+encrouched> Neato !
[2:49:46] <%trustycoyote> Reminds me of the feyline bomb trick in old MonHun
[2:49:49] <ashbirds> magic in vanilla ds3 is doable but way more limited
[2:49:51] <BlacSoul> @SpicyCheeseNips pretty sure he is casting, since the candlestick can cast spells
[2:49:54] <%jamesvdv12> thats one killer menorah
[2:49:55] <MayorRev> !uptime

[2:49:55] <Shillk> horace must be so confused
[2:49:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 50m.
[2:49:56] <Calek> why not both
[2:50:02] <%possumwalsh1221> @quadraticgravity you’d have to have a million ashen estus wouldn’t you? Oh no
[2:50:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> @possumwalsh1221 it would be weaker and you would have limited spell use in between bonfires
[2:50:04] <+AppleBasket> dark is fantastic on 80% of enemies in the game
[2:50:09] <%QuadraticGravity> @PatStaresAt After summoning Horace, Anri's summon sign appeared for me at the top of the stairs there.
[2:50:13] <tacostarvedbeast> time to DUAL WIELD
[2:50:14] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @BlacSoul Ohhh so it works like the blueflame then, I see.
[2:50:14] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt hey how's it going
[2:50:15] <Monkeyweed21> pump Int for some magic
[2:50:16] <%Shadicara> embrace the dahkness
[2:50:19] <0RothTheMoth0> Good luck with the incest baby
[2:50:25] <$lotharrio> Maybe just turn the other sword into a Magic one?
[2:50:34] <%Valdorick> They're using GUN
[2:50:35] <Hellarussian> jeez guy
[2:50:35] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:50:36] <tacostarvedbeast> beefy boys making big noise
[2:50:38] <jhonxiolonn> since pat is doing this awesome mage build, i might as well just go faith
[2:50:40] <BlacSoul> @SpicyCheeseNips Ye
[2:50:42] <%FacetiousAF> this appears to be NOT WORKING
[2:50:42] <%possumwalsh1221> Oh I forgot about magic limits in vanilla LUL oof

[2:51:10] <themagic_conch> HahaNutcracker
[2:51:10] <BlacSoul> ?
[2:51:11] <MayorRev> Is this a character action game?
[2:51:11] <+AppleBasket> THE LAWNMOWER
[2:51:16] <Chimeraelite> You can redo boss fights for their full rewards. Boss soul and soul count. I fucking LOVE this mod
[2:51:18] <Zombrocom> Get solaire in here too
[2:51:19] <BlacSoul> memory?
[2:51:23] <%QuadraticGravity> @Mitchellsocks Not even ascetic, just a reset
[2:51:28] <tommynocturnal> Trimming hedges!!!!
[2:51:36] <%SpicyCheeseNips> When I fought this boss I didn't even notice those knight guys until after the fight.
[2:51:43] <zamzoph> Why is Pat doing this again?
[2:51:45] <jhonxiolonn> that other magical sword that had a big hit sweep, could work in this fight
[2:51:52] <Calek> @Chimeraelite do it without getting hit and you get a little bit extra too
[2:51:53] <+Mitchellsocks> This mod's really just a sandbox at this point, seems awesome
[2:51:55] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @zamzoph Souls and weapon testing I think
[2:51:56] <lordchum1150> Wonder if you can farm ancient wyvern then
[2:51:58] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> heal
[2:51:59] <%DensityD> Did Horace throw out a MF'ing straight kick?
[2:52:03] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I
[2:52:04] <%Stellarcirclefive> psaWhat
[2:52:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah the regular dark edge would probably be good here
[2:52:23] <%WhereIsWill> it's a damn warzone in here!
[2:52:26] <ashbirds> these dudes are hyper resistant to dark
[2:52:35] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> fat evil!
[2:52:39] <Zombrocom> They are quite literally oozing with the dark
[2:52:41] <Chimeraelite> oh I know @Calek I beat Vordt a little while ago. It's neat, but I don't even have the upgrade mats for the full upgrade anyway lol.
[2:52:42] <Aydarkzero> monkaS

[2:52:56] <%QuadraticGravity> huh, wonder why
[2:52:58] <Chimeraelite> Missing some chunks. Did the reverse run through and got a Slab
[2:53:10] <%TheREALGirthMan> This fight is actually a hallucination. You're really just smacking the shit out of the pope while blitzed on bath salts
[2:53:11] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaaaay
[2:53:13] <%DensityD> good testing
[2:53:14] <+AppleBasket> you blended those boys HARDCORE

[2:53:21] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Wait does the pope guy have a BEARD?
[2:53:24] <tommynocturnal> Cool
[2:53:25] <%Typhaeon> So the Pope is Jenova, got it
[2:53:27] <ashbirds> in this version their big powerup attack inflicts curse for the duration of the channeling
[2:53:28] <tacostarvedbeast> ANOTHER ONE
[2:53:29] <jhonxiolonn> i wanna see the nightmare fight
[2:53:31] <ashbirds> it's a fucking nightmare
[2:53:31] <%WhereIsWill> mobs in the dreg heap got crazy dark resistance

[2:54:08] <Zombrocom> You can only have two summons
[2:54:14] <tacostarvedbeast> @lotharrio sometimes you just need to lett someone know that they are grindable
[2:54:16] <%SpicyCheeseNips> It should be in front of the stair case?
[2:54:16] <+AppleBasket> need a finger to summon another
[2:54:18] <%QuadraticGravity> @PatStaresAt I did it yesterday, it appeared on the red carpet top and center.
[2:54:19] <Aydarkzero> pretty sure Anri's summon sign is always there
[2:54:22] <%WhereIsWill> can you summon solaire tho?
[2:54:28] <Aydarkzero> unless it's a Cinders mod thing
[2:54:29] <%possumwalsh1221> I definitely remember anri in vanilla
[2:54:30] <tommynocturnal> Summon Peter Dinklage
[2:54:32] <ashbirds> if you banish they won't rrespawn until reset

[2:55:30] <%KishinGrek> Your avatar is all HAt Lmao
[2:55:47] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Is the area Paige applying the broccoli to getting numb? If so take it off.
[2:55:49] <%QuadraticGravity> Now, she appeared top-center of the red carpet after I summoned Horace, so there might be other things that cause it.
[2:55:49] <LeBlanc233> Ya this character is like 60% hat
[2:55:50] <%Nobrev> whore us

[2:57:07] <tacostarvedbeast> makes sense cause she herself is a side alcove
[2:57:07] <shawshankiest> I just did this and it was in the center like most are saying. Don't know why it isn"t there
[2:57:09] <%QuadraticGravity> Nah I was playing Cinders yesterday and got her

[3:01:54] <+AppleBasket> broccoli is already disgusting
[3:01:57] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Its neat having the bloodborne weapons in the mod, but without the transforming mechanic its just not the same.
[3:01:58] <nastybagl> hey pat nice hat
[3:01:59] <YourBuddyBodhi> Covered in Pat's Special Salt

[3:02:36] <tacostarvedbeast> oh thats cute they added a dummy
[3:02:36] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Don't feel good about NOT recommending using a damp towel with the frozen veggies. I'd really feel bad if Paige's skin got irritated by the cold pack.
[3:02:38] <%xcompleasedad> That is BIG
[3:02:41] <%FacetiousAF> that's a big number
[3:02:44] <+Remery_> Broccoli, Cauliflower, Asperagus can all go
[3:02:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> @SpicyCheeseNips ok listen
[3:02:50] <nastybagl> if ur gonna drown it in ranch u might as well not eat broccoli

[3:02:57] <+AppleBasket> silverknight shield is somewhere
[3:02:58] <Aydarkzero> the Drangleic shield maybe
[3:02:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Do you think "sweating" is called that because someone saw someone sweating themselves but there wasn't a word for it yet so they said "You are so wetting!"
[3:03:02] <@SoFarFetched> yeah having a towel helps when using the frozen vegetables
[3:03:04] <%Nope80808> Shield of Want
[3:03:05] <%arcaderabbit48> Add cheese to brocolli

[3:03:36] <%xcompleasedad> Level time?
[3:03:37] <jhonxiolonn> you can get to 40 with equipment
[3:03:40] <+AppleBasket> potatoes are a fruit
[3:03:45] <ashbirds> dark bead's a covenant reward for the aldrich faithful baby
[3:03:45] <Zombrocom> Dark bead is in a while
[3:03:49] <%xcompleasedad> @AppleBasket No, they are a tuber
[3:03:51] <Aydarkzero> i would say Black Knight Shield but it's prob too heavy
[3:03:52] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt the shield of the hunted eventually hits 100% physical but you have to upgrade for it
[3:03:55] <+Remery_> potatoes are just figments of your imagination
[3:03:55] <%KishinGrek> potatoes are a starch
[3:03:55] <tacostarvedbeast> pat wants sick flame decals or maybe the steve harvey shield of power
[3:03:58] <xWanderingFlame> Wheat bread

[3:04:38] <%Ranryu692> that's pretty cool
[3:04:39] <Gallhint> Thats gonna be either usper strong or super weak
[3:04:39] <Zombrocom> It's like an evil machine gun of dankness
[3:04:39] <tacostarvedbeast> ahh, so its a combo extender, i bet it OTGs too
[3:04:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Potatos are a starch root vegetables, but they are a vegetable
[3:04:40] <%FacetiousAF> that's... different
[3:04:40] <ambadev> That's a big load
[3:04:40] <jhonxiolonn> That's probably not so strongtho

[3:04:55] <%g0atmeal> AoE
[3:04:57] <%holydeviant1> Impressive but better as an AOE
[3:04:57] <%possumwalsh1221> that will SHRED big enemies
[3:04:58] <ashbirds> skelly is a bad target for it bc he doesnt move
[3:04:58] <+Standard_Enemy> Can you cast multiple?
[3:05:00] <%KishinGrek> boil em, mash em ,stick em in a stee
[3:05:00] <waifoong98> would be if it all hits...
[3:05:00] <%TheREALGirthMan> Probably good stagger?
[3:05:00] <jhonxiolonn> is like
[3:05:01] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> big groups
[3:05:01] <%LaughingCatt> if all of em hit

[3:09:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> Cinders reduced the phys block of a lot of shields to 90%
[3:09:12] <%Nope80808> Im sitting here with the game open lookin at the shield of want and its 100%
[3:09:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @Travmanic Yes
[3:09:16] <%FacetiousAF> curious...
[3:09:17] <%FacetiousAF> knight
[3:09:21] <Gallhint> A dragon quest shield but its just a slime :3c
[3:09:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because it's a mod, Nope
[3:09:24] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> im looking at 100%
[3:09:26] <jhonxiolonn> try upgrading shields, you'll see why
[3:09:31] <+encrouched> IMMORTAL DRAGON GREATSHIELD PAT
[3:09:32] <RubberFistFight> @Nope80808 you looking at vanilla or at cinders-modded?
[3:09:38] <tommynocturnal> I never used shields my opinion is worthless
[3:09:38] <jhonxiolonn> every upgrade gives like 2%
[3:09:41] <+major_dude> is that cause of cinders?
[3:09:45] <%Nope80808> @RubberFistFight Normal
[3:09:54] <+thotacon_tv> Black knight shield is 100% and has the skill secondary
[3:10:00] <%Nope80808> @RubberFistFight does cinders nerf stuff?
[3:10:06] <RubberFistFight> lol at the people going "hurr i'm lookin at it right now pat you're wrong" whilst they're looking at a vanilla, unmodded version of the game.
[3:10:10] <T_Sasquatch> Why is every streamer I'm into suddenly want to play ds3
[3:10:20] <tacostarvedbeast> also looks much nicer
[3:10:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> Cinders changes probably every item
[3:10:25] <%Maids4lyfe> it's ds3 but mods
[3:10:28] <RubberFistFight> like christ guys, he's made it clear over the past like 4 days he's playing Cinders which is a HEAVILY modded version of the game.
[3:10:30] <%Binary_Fireball> because its the shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[3:10:35] <RubberFistFight> get with the program.
[3:10:35] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat is cool and a huge hero
[3:10:40] <zamzoph> I N F L U E N C E R
[3:10:44] <+Remery_> Pat's a trend setter?
[3:10:46] <+Karebuncle> yeah randomizer mod thing Cinders brought back the hype
[3:10:49] <%Binary_Fireball> Pat is a trend
[3:10:51] <%Nope80808> @RubberFistFight Most of use assumed that this game full of IMPROVEMENTS wouldnt nerf a farming shield
[3:10:52] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat is the original e-thot
[3:10:59] <%FacetiousAF> we simp pat
[3:11:03] <+nekodelic> pat is a trend-setter
[3:11:07] <RubberFistFight> @Nope80808 well that's what you get for assuming, isn't it.
[3:11:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> pc games wrote an article about cinders, lol. it's getting around!
[3:11:12] <Sir_Blitz> you would have thot
[3:11:13] <Aydarkzero> Dollie for sure
[3:11:14] <%Typhaeon> Vampira before Elvira
[3:11:15] <$lotharrio> Elvira MIGHT be.
[3:11:16] <%Binary_Fireball> Helen of Troy
[3:11:17] <%superstarsage> wouldn't the whole big sale going on also be a reason?
[3:11:17] <xWanderingFlame> @rubberfistfight lol
[3:11:18] <jhonxiolonn> ilegal ethot
[3:11:22] <$Piemono> How can you be an E-thot before the E

[3:11:26] <%Nope80808> @RubberFistFight Whatever asshat
[3:11:26] <tommynocturnal> I thought that was chris chan
[3:11:29] <SaltyAzteca> he is dedicated
[3:11:31] <%Binary_Fireball> fucking Eve
[3:11:33] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat Did you invented Dark Souls?

[3:11:35] <%TheREALGirthMan> @tommynocturnal Don't you dare

[3:11:56] <%arcaderabbit48> Electro Thot Therapy
[3:11:56] <tacostarvedbeast> @PatStaresAt did u ever mess with endless space 1? liked it but felt lacking so ur recommend for the sequel would go a long way
[3:11:56] <%SirGO0SE> tvEthot

[3:11:59] <%Binary_Fireball> said some twitter person
[3:11:59] <Kalinflip> I fuckin love thots what the fuck wrong with yall atpCarl
[3:12:04] <mobiusnightshade> The original e-thot was probably a radio star.
[3:12:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> the original CRThot
[3:12:04] <%Nope80808> Fine fine i blocked him
[3:12:05] <M4eta> electric =/= electronic
[3:12:08] <%Ynkubus18> It would be way before Elvira then
[3:12:10] <Jonath92> for a hot minute, i thought you were referrimg to Dolly Parton LUL
[3:12:13] <+Karebuncle> so like Lucille Ball then cause radio?
[3:12:13] <$lotharrio> Oh god I hated this part.
[3:12:17] <+wmeldrum> elvira might be more of an R-thot
[3:12:21] <mobiusnightshade> Lucille Ball, yes!
[3:12:24] <%Binary_Fireball> Marilyn Monroe?
[3:12:25] <tommynocturnal> Elvira is still bae
[3:12:40] <%NickCaesar7> bitches better not be talking shit about Elvira or Dolly Parton. those women are national treasures
[3:12:43] <%jamesvdv12> is an ethot just someone who streams thrist traps?
[3:12:43] <Zombrocom> I didn't do it twice
[3:12:44] <@SoFarFetched> Elvira was recently in a pinball machine with it's third Elvira themed pinball.
[3:12:46] <%Typhaeon> E-thots aren't funny though, like Pat Kappa
[3:12:47] <%g0atmeal> Why do you have to do it twice?
[3:12:48] <+TheBitingIrish> These knights up here drop an exclusive crossbow at like 3% chance LUL
[3:12:49] <+AppleBasket> what do people have against thots?
[3:12:54] <+AppleBasket> Pat is a thot
[3:12:55] <tommynocturnal> On fleek as it were
[3:12:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> @PatStaresAt since you are the elvira of the *** world, can you tell us a spooky but very sexy monster story?
[3:13:04] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Pat remember, if you wanna do Sirris's questline DON'T JOIN Rosarias covenant until you complete it.
[3:13:05] <%FacetiousAF> elvira definitely counts, people probably wanted her bathwater
[3:13:08] <BurdRightsActivist> Dolly Parton sucks. Imma talk shit about her
[3:13:10] <GrimEnigma> summon swords tech
[3:13:16] <%daemonazaezal> what is giving him the ember effect?
[3:13:20] <RubberFistFight> @Nope80808 Kappa
[3:13:23] <jhonxiolonn> those summoned balls are great
[3:13:23] <%Binary_Fireball> Dolly always seemed nice? dont know much about her
[3:13:26] <@SoFarFetched> @BurdRightsActivist hey don't talk shit about jojo's
[3:13:27] <Zombrocom> You can join her covenant, just don't use the "Pledge to Rosaria" option
[3:13:43] <tacostarvedbeast> lol i knew paige would perk up at that
[3:13:43] <@commanderclaw> leave her alone, she's working 9 to 5
[3:13:47] <+Karebuncle> Dolly Parton is great

[3:13:57] <+AppleBasket> as long as you don't give Rosaria a tongue, Sirris should still like you
[3:14:00] <%Nobrev> anyone who disses dolly parton gets these hands
[3:14:00] <%FacetiousAF> i hate these fuckin rafters
[3:14:01] <Jonath92> Dolly Parton is a treasure
[3:14:02] <+TheOneCalledRock> I am so confused
[3:14:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Yo, fuck THIS place

[3:14:08] <%filialpails> I hope she eventually got together with jolene
[3:14:08] <tommynocturnal> Yeah her boobs are amazing guys dollys great
[3:14:11] <+nekodelic> the original e-thot was Brigitte Bardot
[3:14:13] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @Zombrocom Isn't that what Pledging is though? Joining her covenant or did the mod changed that? I haven't checked in my game.
[3:14:13] <+encrouched> Tonya Harding is a piece of shit
[3:14:14] <@SoFarFetched> @RubberFistFight @commanderclaw now the song is in my head
[3:14:15] <tacostarvedbeast> the big X's always make me think of DMX, its a really dumb thought
[3:14:18] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it seems you're letting them hit you, you shouldn't be doing that Kappa
[3:14:19] <%Binary_Fireball> The real question is who was the original siimp?
[3:14:22] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dolly Parton has a theme park called Dollywood
[3:14:24] <RubberFistFight> @SoFarFetched YOU'RE WELCOME
[3:14:25] <DashXero> Dang. That guy was goin' in hard.
[3:14:31] <T_Sasquatch> @binary_fireball ADAM
[3:14:33] <%NickCaesar7> Dolly Parton gives free books to kids and has fat tits and a sweet accent.
[3:14:34] <%BeatBo_2> ADAM
[3:14:35] <%Typhaeon> Damn
[3:14:36] <%Binary_Fireball> shhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeiiit

[3:14:43] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Wow
[3:14:43] <kindashagg> Fair
[3:14:44] <+TheOneCalledRock> HOLY SHIT YOU ARE RIGHT
[3:14:44] <BurdRightsActivist> @Binary_Fireball Sahmael
[3:14:45] <zamzoph> Adam should've kept his woman in line
[3:14:46] <cuttingwolfe22> why not Eve
[3:14:47] <$lotharrio> No, he had kids with her...
[3:14:50] <huskarl_zap> IF SHE BREATHES
[3:14:51] <+AppleBasket> Eve did crimes but was hot, she's Morally Grey
[3:14:51] <+PenmanLupine> Eve was the only one with those titties
[3:14:51] <%Shacklebox> first titties he had ever seen
[3:14:52] <$lotharrio> Lilith maybe?
[3:14:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Listen

[3:14:55] <%Ner234> The Ur-Tits

[3:14:58] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Get dunked on Adam, I guess.
[3:14:58] <%Binary_Fireball> It literally only clicked the other day that Adam and Eve is a story about how sex ruined the world
[3:14:58] <MayorRev> BAYBEE
[3:15:01] <mobiusnightshade> Original Sin(mp)
[3:15:01] <Zombrocom> @SpicyCheeseNips So it vanilla, you cou;d join the covenant, you just couldn't give her any tongues. In the mod, you just can't use the "Pledge loyalty to Rosaria" option
[3:15:02] <%Binary_Fireball> and that's just fucked
[3:15:03] <+Karebuncle> Adam simped for lillith yeah
[3:15:03] <RubberFistFight> Adam let Eve get away with making him break up with his first girlfriend Lilith SO HARD that he let her completely write Lilith out of the stories.
[3:15:04] <huskarl_zap> SHES A THOOOOOOOOOOOOT
[3:15:04] <Gallhint> Imagine trusting an actual animal snake

[3:15:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> Giant Milkers are a perfect distraaction for most men

[3:15:47] <tommynocturnal> Zeus boned everything
[3:15:50] <RubberFistFight> Lilith was like "Fine, Eve, have it your way. I'mma go fuck some demons and make a WHOLE RACE OF DEMONS. Then who'll be laughing?"

[3:16:13] <MayorRev> psaMenace
[3:16:13] <T_Sasquatch> Ah yes lilith the easily forgotten pgmy

[3:16:26] <RubberFistFight> @SpicyCheeseNips the Lilim are a race of demons.
[3:16:27] <+nekodelic> @n_wolfwood that's why he's such a simp
[3:16:27] <supergoblinpunch> The Serpent was the Original Influencer
[3:16:28] <prhymes321> Elvira was also a redhead and those funbags where all natural she was also the first cosplay model

[3:21:19] <LSpiral> Using the "pledge loyalty" option fucks you in Sirris' questline, but joining the covenent and respeccing will not fuck you, according to the mod's wiki
[3:21:20] <tacostarvedbeast> @SpicyCheeseNips haircut
[3:21:20] <+AppleBasket> you could lower your HP or STA for more stats
[3:21:22] <BurdRightsActivist> @SpicyCheeseNips yes
[3:21:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Dont you need 20 in both?
[3:21:30] <%QuadraticGravity> I don't know if that applies to the weapon reqs.
[3:21:31] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Praise Haircut
[3:21:33] <%g0atmeal> Do armor bonuses count to requirements?
[3:21:37] <hcsarg1986> When more Ace Attorney Pat?
[3:21:49] <+AppleBasket> probably important to hit 20 faith
[3:21:50] <%QuadraticGravity> Let's find out, respec is cheap anyways
[3:21:52] <%jamesvdv12> pat just went from chad to simp
[3:21:53] <%Laecerelius> Yeah Pat was able to use a spell by putting on some stat upping gear
[3:21:54] <Zombrocom> Chest is 3 boots is 2 faith IIRC
[3:22:04] <%SpicyCheeseNips> You can trick Orbeck with int gear if you're too dumb to learn sorceries
[3:22:05] <Scrummo> you could respec to 3 Attunement slots and use a ring if you need more
[3:22:08] <tacostarvedbeast> oh does pat do voices when hes on peach's ace streams? id LOVE to see that
[3:22:12] <%incredibleCrayon> You know what? I freakin love toast. Toast is great!

[3:32:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Check his mouth I had a cat want a stick before because something stuck on the top of her mouth
[3:32:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Every cat I've ever had has loved Pencils. It makes doing schoolwork hard
[3:32:17] <$lotharrio> Everything that kills him.
[3:32:17] <+linSP> give stick
[3:32:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> eraser, the forbidden dry gummy

[3:32:58] <%daemonazaezal> My dog ate chocolate the other night and threw up everywhere
[3:32:59] <$lotharrio> Except for Paige coffee.
[3:33:01] <crimsonsaens> no fish?
[3:33:02] <+Remery_> My cat loves pizza
[3:33:05] <tacostarvedbeast> elmo wont even eat wagyu beef?
[3:33:05] <TheCoobie> psaBlep psaBlep psaGib psaGib
[3:33:06] <NeroInfinite> He's a strange cat.
[3:33:09] <Baeltyr> oh no, Elmos a vegan Kappa
[3:33:10] <+bdjayr13> Mines likes attached wires. Its mad weird bro
[3:33:11] <LillethBlue> so vegetarian
[3:33:12] <%FacetiousAF> tuna???
[3:33:15] <%jamesvdv12> He only craves KNOWLEDGE
[3:33:17] <%Archphronimos> He has very.... unique tastes, much like his parents?
[3:33:18] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I'm actually speechless
[3:33:18] <$lotharrio> I mean I'm with him on that, but I'm not a cat.
[3:33:21] <%KishinGrek> Lol silly boy
[3:33:23] <Sundaysmiles01> I'd like to see Elmo attempt the Tram car Morale scenario
[3:33:25] <%Binary_Fireball> cheese?
[3:33:25] <jhonxiolonn> What a cool looking mage
[3:33:28] <Jaller101514> he likes Paige backwater
[3:33:28] <%TalisKanju> Wet food?
[3:33:28] <%beepbeepbopbop> What is wrong with your cat.
[3:33:29] <supergoblinpunch> Elmo's like those guys that eat Sofa Foam
[3:33:32] <crimsonsaens> How old is he?
[3:33:32] <+Remery_> Milk?
[3:33:32] <$ItsRatman> Does Elmo know he is a cat?
[3:33:34] <%FacetiousAF> gingers?
[3:33:35] <tacostarvedbeast> i bet emlo prefers impossible burgers
[3:33:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> I used to have a dog that sought out chocolate...she was also the only dog not to get sick after eating it
[3:33:35] <+Jaysky> I'm willing to bet Elmo will love earwax.
[3:33:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @daemonazaezal We had to induce vomiting in our two guard dogs one night after they ate a bottle of pills. That was an experience
[3:33:35] <%beepbeepbopbop> It's so broken
[3:33:35] <+thefakeh> the most famous meat, egg
[3:33:37] <%Keyd00d> even EGG
[3:33:37] <$lotharrio> So what you're saying is that he's an outside cat?
[3:33:38] <BlacSoul> thats actually kind of normal
[3:33:45] <%Punchasaur> he really is a stupid baby
[3:33:45] <DashXero> Does Elmo drink water?
[3:33:46] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Btw I just saw a video today of a group of cats eating a skinned rabbit. It was weirdly cute.
[3:33:47] <+ALazo> have you hidden the good food inside the shitty food?
[3:33:47] <+Promessa_EX> my stupid cat thinks my food is his food and he goes nuts when i push him away
[3:33:49] <%FacetiousAF> he's perfect for you two
[3:33:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> wet food isn't any good for him anyway, why are you trying so many different ones?
[3:33:52] <%AnIrishPapaya> What about cheese on his face?
[3:33:52] <Travmanic> gamer girl broccoli?
[3:33:53] <%Binary_Fireball> blood of the innocent?
[3:33:53] <%arcaderabbit48> Egg is protein
[3:33:54] <$lotharrio> ...wait he has fake teeth?
[3:33:55] <Baeltyr> maaaan, Elmos so busted
[3:33:59] <Scrummo> Elmo is the single vegan cat alive
[3:34:03] <+Jaysky> Offer Elmo earwax he'll beg for it Paige
[3:34:05] <%beepbeepbopbop> Not even raw meat?
[3:34:05] <%Archphronimos> My mom has a cat that hates all human food except the cheese sauce from 1 particular brand of microwaveable mac and cheese, that's the only human food he likes, and he LOVES IT
[3:34:08] <%cureneckbeard> Woolie doesn't like egg either. Maybe you should try feeding Elmo some Greek food. Woolie loves that.
[3:34:11] <+mitchyb603> lol
[3:34:16] <%KishinGrek> Surgically replaced teeth
[3:34:17] <Baeltyr> ahahah
[3:34:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL What a dumb cat
[3:34:31] <DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt sounds like elmo has Pica
[3:34:31] <Baeltyr> oh nooo
[3:34:32] <zamzoph> was elmo being a racist cat?
[3:34:35] <YourBuddyBodhi> oh no smellmo

[3:34:36] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:34:36] <LillethBlue> The perfect cat for you two
[3:34:40] <Sundaysmiles01> for a second I thought you said thats how Woolie eats his food
[3:34:41] <cherubs_anonymous> What a wonderful first impression
[3:34:41] <crimsonsaens> seems appropriate
[3:34:41] <%Aleate> Smellmo is best Elmo tho-mo
[3:34:45] <Baeltyr> awww, i want Woolie and Elmo play time
[3:34:45] <Mr_Strut> Why is this cat so fucking stupid I love him
[3:34:45] <$lotharrio> Why were his teeth all replaced?
[3:34:45] <%weissguard> Fitting.
[3:34:46] <NeroInfinite> That's a hell of a first impression
[3:34:47] <%Keyd00d> pika chu
[3:34:47] <%kewlmyc> "Pat, your cat is stupid." - Woolie
[3:34:50] <%TalisKanju> Specifically hair

[3:34:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @Sundaysmiles01 Oh thank god, I thought I was the only one
[3:34:53] <tacostarvedbeast> i mean, woolie got an accurate representation of your cat right?
[3:34:55] <rekinom> Like Paige with sucker sticks @PatStaresAt
[3:34:59] <Supathief> moon2E
[3:35:00] <$lotharrio> Iron deficiency. Desire to eat ice and sand and siht.

[3:35:06] <RubberFistFight> often happens to ladies when they're pragmant because of the hormonal disruptions.
[3:35:07] <%FacetiousAF> oh no
[3:35:08] <Travmanic> nope
[3:35:09] <%DensityD> you can get Pica from caniballism
[3:35:10] <%WhereIsWill> oh noooo

[3:35:36] <%Punchasaur> if paige didn't pull him out of that dumpster he'd be dead as fuck
[3:35:38] <socratetris> @archphronimos it just might work
[3:35:41] <%SpicyCheeseNips> WHAT IS THAT
[3:35:42] <tacostarvedbeast> oh yea, woolie likes brining up that racist pet he had to interact with lol
[3:35:45] <%Binary_Fireball> curse is the worst
[3:35:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Basilisk hat?

[3:36:16] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Watch out for those grabby bois
[3:36:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Jesus Christ, its like a Melee tournament in here!
[3:36:21] <%SpicyCheeseNips> They are ASSHOLES
[3:36:24] <Zombrocom> They are weak to everything
[3:36:28] <SmolBluGhost> the swamp in now an EVEN MORE HORRIBLE place...gREAT
[3:36:28] <mostundesired> Shouldn't they... not be weak to dark? All things considered?
[3:36:29] <N_Wolfwood> perfect
[3:36:30] <Leaferson> Did this mod buff Faith spells?
[3:36:34] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:36:35] <%Keyd00d> telling lies?
[3:36:37] <tacostarvedbeast> the grabby bois will grabby patty @SpicyCheeseNips
[3:36:43] <BlacSoul> fair, i respect it
[3:36:44] <%Punchasaur> oh so you basically get to be a mage with a greatsword
[3:36:45] <%Keyd00d> moth
[3:36:47] <%YakumoYomi> Don't forget to fight Gundyr outside of Firelink.

[3:36:48] <Sundaysmiles01> you fightin dem humpy bois
[3:36:50] <%QuadraticGravity> @mostundesired believe it or not they're fire-related enemies.
[3:36:51] <%TheWinged7> boop bop beep boo
[3:36:51] <TheArrow_> oh i see
[3:36:53] <SethAm_> I feel like this mod buffs everything and makes it all viable
[3:36:55] <%SirGO0SE> nice job
[3:36:56] <Leaferson> Yeeesss
[3:36:57] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Faith is good now
[3:37:01] <%Aleate> psaElmo
[3:37:02] <NeroInfinite> Pat speaks for a living folks
[3:37:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Leaferson one of the classes starts with lightning spear even
[3:37:02] <%StaceMcGate> HE SCREAM
[3:37:02] <%TheWinged7> psaPorgmo
[3:37:03] <crimsonsaens> Istarelle is a Destructo Disc machine gun
[3:37:05] <Daebunz> elmo screm
[3:37:07] <%SvenHolgersson> SCREAMMMMMMM
[3:37:07] <+Jaysky> MAOOO
[3:37:08] <%FacetiousAF> screem
[3:37:08] <%Dementedpenguin> psaGib
[3:37:08] <%Punchasaur> reeeeer
[3:37:10] <Chimeraelite> Dude I've found like 3 RINGS that boost Faith, Pyro and Sorcs it's insane.
[3:37:10] <SmolBluGhost> screm
[3:37:12] <%arcaderabbit48> @QuadraticGravity But they killed the demons? So shouldn't they resist fire if they managed that?
[3:37:12] <%BubbaRands> psaPorgmo MUTHERR
[3:37:14] <SethAm_> Could probably easily run a bow only run from what i've seen
[3:37:14] <%Piemen99> BABY
[3:37:15] <Travmanic> He demands pencil
[3:37:18] <srkAres> psaElmo
[3:37:20] <Aydarkzero> oh great
[3:37:20] <Leaferson> @aWanderingKaivo That's actually crazy, I love it
[3:37:22] <tacostarvedbeast> less effective that i had hoped
[3:37:22] <%jamesvdv12> Give the man some damn eraser!
[3:37:23] <%DappercatEsquire> BIG SOUND EFFECTS
[3:37:26] <%Laecerelius> torrent seems better when they're farther away
[3:37:30] <%LaughingCatt> its quite good when it actually HITS them
[3:37:33] <tacostarvedbeast> i bet its good against HUGE enemies
[3:37:34] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Also Pyro is kinda OP right off of the back
[3:37:36] <%arcaderabbit48> That spells doesn't seem good
[3:37:37] <BlacSoul> It turns WITH you
[3:37:37] <%QuadraticGravity> @PatStaresAt Torrents fire off in the direction you're facing, so rotating around turns it towards the wall
[3:37:38] <jhonxiolonn> that's such a weird spell
[3:37:38] <Zombrocom> Torrent is super inaccurate
[3:37:41] <duraju> pat you have to hit them
[3:37:42] <%Aleate> SICK
[3:37:43] <%Valdorick> OH NO
[3:37:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh FUCK this area the hell
[3:37:43] <%Archphronimos> give Elmo some good organic wooden dowels to play with
[3:37:44] <%Laecerelius> Woof
[3:37:44] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Something about how spell tools work
[3:37:46] <doritomancerr> LUL
[3:37:46] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:37:48] <+GenesisKnight> WHAT
[3:37:49] <Baeltyr> waow
[3:37:49] <%FacetiousAF> TRASH
[3:37:50] <Leaferson> LUL
[3:37:50] <%BubbaRands> LUL
[3:37:50] <crimsonsaens> DISAPPOINTED
[3:37:53] <NeroInfinite> that's sick
[3:37:53] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Ehhh
[3:38:00] <tolloponik> dose the spell fire based on what you face?
[3:38:01] <%KishinGrek> Aww come on
[3:38:03] <Leaferson> Probably really good on big targets
[3:38:03] <%QuadraticGravity> They turn with your character facing
[3:38:03] <%Valdorick> For its FP cost, it doesn't even seem to work.
[3:38:04] <%Laecerelius> Looks like it'd be good for big ass enemies
[3:38:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Leaferson yeah I think I'm going to do a run starting with it. I love the lightning spear animations in DS3
[3:38:05] <%Nobrev> that seems like a boss fight spell
[3:38:05] <Zbyrd0961> use on big boys
[3:38:05] <%Punchasaur> range bad
[3:38:06] <Scrummo> cool looking at least
[3:38:10] <%Taengoo31> Range is kinda trash
[3:38:12] <%WhereIsWill> it'll wreck bosses
[3:38:13] <%SpicyCheeseNips> wha
[3:38:15] <%BubbaRands> AIM
[3:38:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Weird
[3:38:18] <jhonxiolonn> Wait
[3:38:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> Lock on to enemies and it focuses
[3:38:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh, nice
[3:38:21] <jhonxiolonn> what
[3:38:22] <%SpicyCheeseNips> OH SHIT YOU CAN
[3:38:22] <%LaughingCatt> it'll be really good against big boys
[3:38:22] <%arcaderabbit48> Cool, but weird
[3:38:23] <%BubbaRands> PogChamp
[3:38:24] <Aydarkzero> when did Dark Souls get Firaga Burst?
[3:38:27] <crimsonsaens> It'd be nearly broken in pvp
[3:38:28] <BlacSoul> It turns WITH YOU
[3:38:28] <%Aleate> What happens when you cast it and lock on? ruuThink
[3:38:30] <Travmanic> lock on
[3:38:30] <%QuadraticGravity> Fire it then face the camera
[3:38:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> There's a similar miracle that shoots lightning.
[3:38:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That sounds interesting
[3:38:37] <lordchum1150> Was that basilisk thing a hat?
[3:38:37] <%Taengoo31> woo you can aim thats actually better
[3:38:47] <Admiralpoosh> i can't tell if this spell is good or not LUL
[3:38:49] <tacostarvedbeast> hmmmm, i mean that with a good shield could be a fun slow way to kill a boss
[3:38:54] <Leaferson> @aWanderingKaivo I really did too, I always loved doing Paladin builds in PvE. I normally got DS3 to do a randomizer but that's buggy as all hell so I kinda want to try this now
[3:38:58] <%Punchasaur> WOAH
[3:38:59] <%jamesvdv12> reminds of the turret drone in nier automata
[3:38:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's a REALLY good midrange spell and great for bosses, but it's not good for one-on-one fights
[3:39:03] <+encrouched> Lock on bro *Hits blunt*
[3:39:04] <$lotharrio> huh...
[3:39:10] <%SpicyCheeseNips> OH MY GOD
[3:39:11] <%WhereIsWill> it'll take some finesse to use
[3:39:12] <%Valdorick> OH NO
[3:39:17] <%MechArch> amazing
[3:39:18] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I TOLD YOU PAT
[3:39:20] <Damie904> That damage seemed low
[3:39:20] <SethAm_> I found out on of my fave DS2 weapons was in this and now I too wanna do a dark playthrough
[3:39:21] <+GenesisKnight> Yo that spell's trash
[3:39:22] <%Punchasaur> face fucked
[3:39:23] <%Laecerelius> Yeah seems pretty lame
[3:39:23] <+twohitgood> it's really underwhelming
[3:39:23] <Zbyrd0961> use on big guys
[3:39:24] <%Valdorick> That spell seems bad
[3:39:26] <%arcaderabbit48> Fuck the gru
[3:39:27] <%QuadraticGravity> 100% not for mobs
[3:39:28] <$lotharrio> Might be good against bosses?
[3:39:30] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM GRABBY BOIS
[3:39:32] <%Ynkubus18> Ghru hugs!
[3:39:35] <Monkeyweed21> then why did you respec for it cumbo
[3:39:36] <jhonxiolonn> maybe it becomes better with more dex
[3:39:36] <%Laecerelius> Either needs better range or better tracking
[3:39:41] <Zbyrd0961> only on fatties
[3:39:42] <tolloponik> big boys killer
[3:39:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Leaferson my very first run of DS1 ever was a paladin build so it'd make sense if I did that in this mod too
[3:39:52] <+encrouched> Ghru unit
[3:39:52] <tacostarvedbeast> oh no
[3:39:53] <%Valdorick> Oh no sound died

[3:41:12] <tacostarvedbeast> oh like that one movie where they took that guys face off? i cant remember the name
[3:41:16] <%silverira> what happened? I went to the bathroom
[3:41:20] <%StaceMcGate> If Elmo is the cat of Chaos, who is the cat of ORder?
[3:41:22] <aluddss> psaBig psaHoldon

[3:41:25] <+encrouched> Elmoiest Pat
[3:41:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @StaceMcGate The one racist cat woolie had to deal with
[3:41:48] <%BubbaRands> @StaceMcGate Thurston Waffles
[3:41:49] <%Auctorian> Pat: do you need help? Paige: I dunno. *Elmo casually flicks a switchblade by her face*
[3:41:50] <Travmanic> Elmo kill stream?
[3:41:55] <%FacetiousAF> Elmo Stares Pat
[3:42:02] <socratetris> @stacemcgate that racist cat woolie met. embrace chaos
[3:42:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> Elmo the wildcard
[3:42:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Shit we still going boys
[3:42:34] <Pookiedaexzile> I feel asleep
[3:42:39] <socratetris> @burdrightsactivist you did my joke faster than me. congrats
[3:42:47] <RubberFistFight> @silverira dunno, Pat asked paige if she needed help, she said "I don't know" twice kinda distressed-sounding, and then the sound died and the stream went BRB.
[3:43:01] <%silverira> oh shit
[3:43:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait what
[3:43:02] <%Auctorian> We're all laughing, meanwhile Pat and Crazy Talk are throwing down like mad
[3:43:08] <%maenos2> @rubberfistfight that sounds kinda dire...
[3:43:14] <heybenice> Oh no
[3:43:17] <+encrouched> Elmo got the N pass and started to use it on stream so they had to mute
[3:43:27] <Pookiedaexzile> What the fuck did I wake up to
[3:43:27] <%StaceMcGate> You're laughing? A man had his sound cut off by a cat and you're laughing?
[3:43:30] <tacostarvedbeast> implying pat can't handle his own stand, come on hes not holly levels of bad
[3:43:31] <RubberFistFight> @maenos2 yeah it does
[3:43:32] <%cureneckbeard> Elmo has learned to meow the n-word
[3:43:36] <Pookiedaexzile> how long has it been, is she alright
[3:43:45] <%TheREALGirthMan> From what I've gathered, Paige broke her ass and has been indisposed, then Elmo started wilin and Pat had to go contain him
[3:43:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> only a few min
[3:43:46] <jhonxiolonn> Pat was talking like if we were hearing and he went away, that was funny
[3:43:49] <chambatron> what happened?
[3:43:51] <@SoFarFetched> Its probably her back acting up.
[3:43:53] <socratetris> @pookiedaexzile been like 2 min
[3:43:57] <%Auctorian> @Pookiedaexzile it's been minutes, we await the result still
[3:43:58] <Scrummo> Smellmo returns
[3:44:10] <+encrouched> Ass2ass
[3:44:12] <tacostarvedbeast> Neow Pass Plus, woolie and elmo have collabed to bring an exciting new experience
[3:44:14] <rekinom> My hips, my back, 'broke my pussay and my crack
[3:44:17] <@SoFarFetched> From what it sounded like, Paige's ass couldn't fit the groove where Pat's ass would sit and it was too strong for her which broke it.
[3:44:19] <+zoddtheimmortal138> pat should really talk to woolie its affected elmo now.
[3:44:22] <ashbirds> did paige die
[3:44:26] <ashbirds> what happen
[3:44:36] <+encrouched> Requiem for a Paige butt
[3:44:38] <rekinom> Paiges ass was too weak and Pats ass killed it
[3:44:43] <%Auctorian> Nobody knows what's happened, speculations abound
[3:44:44] <@SoFarFetched> At least from what I remember her talking about it on the Dark Souls Mod stream on Saturday
[3:44:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pat's orblike form is too round and strong.
[3:44:51] <%maenos2> reminder that when Paige sat in his groove and was offered w pillow, she put it on her back instead of, yknow, sitting on it.
[3:44:57] <%YakumoYomi> If it's particularly dire, Pat will probably post something in chat.
[3:44:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> skelmo had enough of being the background character and is trying to become the protagonist of the stream
[3:44:58] <Pookiedaexzile> @socratetris @Auctorian Thank you, I got worried as shit I'd come back in the middle of something horrible
[3:45:03] <chambatron> someone leak the ass situation
[3:45:11] <heybenice> I think the best course of action is to automatically assume the worst
[3:45:11] <tacostarvedbeast> i just want pat to come back with a bunch of broccoli on his face
[3:45:12] <jhonxiolonn> LMAO
[3:45:13] <socratetris> quick everyone! start speculating!
