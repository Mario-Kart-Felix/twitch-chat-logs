[0:20:20] <Psyramics> ME3 is nothing like ME1
[0:20:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> ME3 ain't all that great
[0:20:25] <SpaceGuntank> ME3 has good gameplay but bad story
[0:20:27] <%winkoman> play citadel and then quit
[0:20:30] <Ion_Laser> mass effect 3 is worth playing especially with all of its dlc
[0:20:31] <%connos_procrastination> 3 is good but yeah ending sucks
[0:20:34] <ovan20> ME3 is just ok.
[0:20:34] <Pequod1> Mass Effect 3 flubs the ending
[0:20:37] <+BurkeBigsby> ME3 multiplayer was suprisingly great
[0:20:37] <Valdorick> ME3 is better than Andromeda
[0:20:39] <seycheles> @PeachSaliva paige! <3
[0:20:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It's like a worse Gears for gameplay
[0:20:41] <DSD24> Mass Effect 3 has good gameplay
[0:20:41] <zevitunez> citadel is fucking great tho
[0:20:42] <curechan9> me1+2 is good 3 is meh
[0:20:42] <%mrbobby17> mrbobby17 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Oh man 8 months. Thanks again for recommending ff14, made a few new friends from my FC! Anyway keep up the great work!
[0:20:43] <%EmiinV> ME3 is worth playing, the leviathan DLC helped a lot with the ending
[0:20:44] <+Arkfyre> ME3 is fine. There's a whole good game there before you get to the end.
[0:20:49] <Coystick> Mass Effect oh you mean Tali's games
[0:20:55] <%d00msdaydan> if only the writers that came up with such elaborate overarching plotlines actually stayed around to finish them properly
[0:20:57] <$Brother_Coduss> The ending is just "what is your favorite color?"
[0:20:58] <%Nolight23> Nolight23 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:21:01] <Sokumotanaka> Ask mikeburnsfire for his ME3 modded ending
[0:21:05] <%connos_procrastination> all i know is that marauder shields is the greatest HERO of mass effect
[0:21:07] <hottdogman> Mass effect three got some undue hate, the ending controversy overshadowed the rest of the game
[0:21:08] <+Tonku_the_Red> Mass Effect 1-3 is fantastic. I'm actually replaying it right now. The ending isn't as bad a lot of people like to describe.
[0:21:10] <graemecrackers1> @PeachSaliva its fine \m/
[0:21:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> @BurkeBigsby I still play it. Still great. I go back to it with my buddies every couple weeks
[0:21:21] <DSD24> @Brother_Coduss Cherry has been my favorite color
[0:21:24] <+TaurusOxford> Sup chat. doodMaxhype
[0:21:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> At least Gears has a more worked on cover system, ME2 and 3 kinda borked it
[0:21:30] <Pequod1> @hottdogman it was GoT levels of anticlimax
[0:21:33] <$Brother_Coduss> Andromeda was good too
[0:21:34] <derekwst3> he not a hobo anymore
[0:21:35] <CrypticMochi> Still salty about Tali and renegade choices for companions
[0:21:36] <@lewdskeletor13> @taurusoxford Sup dude
[0:21:38] <%Mekhet09> i just hate the idea at the end of and everyone loses technology. such a hack trope.

[0:25:04] <curechan9> i see the cat pisser.
[0:25:14] <+BurkeBigsby> Coach Gun is best gun
[0:25:15] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> shitty hat doesn't even cover up the bald
[0:25:18] <ovan20> hunting rifle Kreygasm
[0:25:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @silverfaustx Yea he recorded it yesterday
[0:25:20] <Pequod1> This game any good?
[0:25:22] <%Archphronimos> So I heard since the game is doing well they're doing first DLC for "free". That true?
[0:25:24] <SilverFaustX> thx
[0:25:27] <+jjhoho> facts, shotgun is gr8888
[0:25:27] <%connos_procrastination> best weapon in the game
[0:25:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Love the design of the shotty
[0:25:30] <%Shadicara> Pat you can never go wrong with a shotgun
[0:25:32] <derekwst3> @SilverFaustX yeah they recorded it already but its audio only again
[0:25:32] <+jjhoho> shotgun is the greatsword
[0:25:36] <+AngriestAngryArtist> rifle is gdlike.
[0:25:38] <Coystick> Any shooty game is only as good as its shotgun
[0:25:39] <SilverFaustX> ah
[0:25:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> "So I grinded off-screen"
[0:25:46] <%starotter70> Did a bit of grinding?
[0:25:48] <%connos_procrastination> grinding offscreen
[0:25:50] <%Shikari21> so i was grinding off screen
[0:25:54] <SleepyMaribo> isnt elder knowledge still bugged?
[0:25:55] <@SSaryn> Good enough, one ring essentially gets you what you just got from Elder Knowledge.
[0:25:58] <%Calek> where'd you get the Sniper Rifle?
[0:25:58] <%dekkitout> "So I gained some eyes on the inside off screen"
[0:25:58] <%Gray_skies1993> apatDab
[0:25:59] <+Jaysky> So I was playing off screen...
[0:26:00] <hottdogman> woah, elder knowledge? is this some lovecraft shit?
[0:26:01] <+BurkeBigsby> Flame mod on coach gun= Boss melt
[0:26:05] <TrollKing96> @AngriestPat I wanna see FromSoft's take on this type of game.
[0:26:06] <pistofficer> shotgun is rough for bosses. gotta be constanly in the danger zone
[0:26:07] <Valdorick> Shotguns, for when you want to face fuck your enemies.
[0:26:10] <%Shadicara> But pat if you're a cowboy use the revolver Kappa

[0:26:11] <%sileo_patronus> @SleepyMaribo bugged how?
[0:26:18] <mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat sup Paterick
[0:26:19] <%MonsieurHedge> the offscreen grind isnt even important because his weapons are still +3. he's on-par
[0:26:20] <ovan20> hunting rifle works well in any range Kreygasm
[0:26:21] <%Nina96> wait is this just gun souls?
[0:26:28] <12gagerager> that overbarrel cocking handle on the shotgun is bugging me way more than i thought it would.
[0:26:28] <@SSaryn> Tell her shes a bitch
[0:26:34] <@lewdskeletor13> Waow rude
[0:26:35] <+Grayhammatter> personally i've been using the repeater pistol and hunting rifle
[0:26:40] <ovan20> @Nina96 more RE4 than souls
[0:26:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> More like Gun Souls 2
[0:26:46] <%MonsieurHedge> magnum/beam rifle 4 lyfe
[0:26:47] <King_Wolf_Rigger> she sucks wood
[0:26:47] <cisealnine> Have you considered looking at WoW Classic?
[0:26:50] <MavMarsh> you can't even really overgrind because zones are always leveled to around your level
[0:26:53] <Valdorick> Ah man, its the Majula Life Gem merchant!
[0:26:55] <+ALTRNico> Souls? vaatiShine
[0:26:56] <%Calek> I'm using fancy fancy weapons
[0:26:56] <%Nina96> @ovan20 k
[0:26:57] <@lewdskeletor13> This VA sounds familiar
[0:27:08] <%Calek> she sounds like the Dark Souls narrator
[0:27:08] <SleepyMaribo> @sileo_patronus it w3as bugged in that the benifits from it would not apply even after lvling it up
[0:27:13] <+Grayhammatter> the laber inth
[0:27:14] <$lacroximus> It's a David Bowie movie.
[0:27:16] <$Brother_Coduss> "Seek, Seek, Lest"
[0:27:18] <RupanSen> she kinda sounds like the gandma in the DS2 intro
[0:27:18] <Pequod1> lol
[0:27:22] <killering5> so what is this game?
[0:27:23] <%mckraven> the labyrinth is a labyrinth
[0:27:26] <%connos_procrastination> @ovan20 its absolutely not RE4
[0:27:30] <%sileo_patronus> @SleepyMaribo damn
[0:27:37] <+Jaysky> She sounds like the old hag narrator in the Dark Souls 2 cinematic
[0:27:39] <%Shadicara> The fuck is this? GunSouls?
[0:27:41] <Coystick> Now she's off to stalk Andre of Astora
[0:27:47] <@SSaryn> Definitely not your Fire Keeper.
[0:27:50] <@lewdskeletor13> @killering5 Apocalypse magic 60s aesthetic game with elements of Souls games
[0:27:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> More like Gun Souls 2
[0:27:56] <ovan20> @connos_procrastination never mind all the gunplay and the guns upgrading LUL
[0:27:58] <%skizzuto> thanks fire keeper lady
[0:28:01] <%MonsieurHedge> alright fellas; which ent weapon is best? which singe weapon is best?
[0:28:05] <Dhurkst> Sure that's not Yoel of Londor?
[0:28:06] <%Shadicara> Can you kill the npcs pat?
[0:28:08] <hottdogman> how far in is pat?
[0:28:12] <TheHeroAppears> she's looks exactly like the weird dude in ds3
[0:28:13] <Coystick> She needs to show feet to be a fire keeper
[0:28:15] <%worldbrand> Gnawed by infinite... uh... whatever this game world has
[0:28:20] <al0nem0nster> @worldbrand roots.
[0:28:26] <black_mages_matter_> more like simulaCUM\
[0:28:31] <killering5> @lewdskeletor13 oh, neat!
[0:28:33] <Coystick> I think I see feet
[0:28:37] <ivansonic08> "Wasing the missing the never"
[0:28:40] <%MonsieurHedge> Simulacrums are both estus shards AND titanite slabs, so think carefully about how much estus you need
[0:28:41] <luckyifpurple> Simulacrum? when did Simaris get involved
[0:28:46] <%Shadicara> Blast the uggo fire keeper Kappa
[0:28:50] <%starotter70> Yeah?
[0:28:53] <+jjhoho> @AngriestPat I haven't got there yet, but reading the simulacrum item desc, it says it's combination titanite slab and estus shard so choose carefully i guess
[0:28:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Call me Nidhoggr cuz Imma fuck these roots up
[0:29:07] <%connos_procrastination> @ovan20 thats where the similarities stop
[0:29:24] <+Hinasil> Gods are just chemicals in your brain
[0:29:30] <+Despera__> Oh whoops I‚Äôve been using all my simulacra lol
[0:29:34] <McAngrimStein> she does go on doesn't she
[0:29:35] <ovan20> @connos_procrastination and the souls similarities is just the ckeckpoints LUL
[0:29:39] <MavMarsh> you won't need simulacrums for equipment until wayyyyyyy later unless you're upgrading equipment obsessively
[0:29:47] <MavMarsh> best to just get the flasks
[0:29:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Ancient assholes make gods.
[0:29:53] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat hope I'm not sending you a bunch of the same message, but I guess my sub message got eaten by Twitch.
[0:29:59] <+Despera__> Ah okay cool
[0:30:02] <curechan9> im am groot
[0:30:03] <darcfowler1995> get out of here with your Mystic bulshit lady be straight up
[0:30:07] <%Gray_skies1993> could be my internet idk
[0:30:20] <%arcaderabbit48> So is everyone else in the base just okay with this creepy, immortal, Root lady just showing up?
[0:30:26] <JArcade> Man Eris Morn raelly let herself go
[0:30:32] <%sileo_patronus> What a nice lady
[0:30:40] <%sileo_patronus> test
[0:30:48] <%sileo_patronus> ok good
[0:30:50] <ovan20> @arcaderabbit48 no, but you're the only one doing shit, so they tolerate it :P
[0:30:53] <+jjhoho> yeah basically they're just kinda like "huh weird"
[0:30:53] <Coystick> Is that LEE!?!!1/
[0:30:56] <%NovaKnightmare> oh shit its Lee
[0:30:56] <%Shikari21> hey Lee
[0:30:57] <+ALTRNico> Is that Lee?
[0:30:57] <+moonmaster928> she reminds me of that creepy merchant lady in DS 2
[0:31:03] <BlazeTheRiolu> oh hey lee
[0:31:04] <%starotter70> Chie Feye Ron
[0:31:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @ovan20 Fair enough!
[0:31:05] <Coystick> I love you LEE!
[0:31:05] <+kauze12> lee?
[0:31:06] <WanderingSwordsman> is this dark souls but with guns
[0:31:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Hey, it's that guy who voiced the Pigeon Hobo in Spider-Man
[0:31:09] <transporterthesequel> Look at this man with access to the script
[0:31:12] <%connos_procrastination> @ovan20 and the healing method, items npc's item lore colour pallette weapon upgrading based on materials etc
[0:31:18] <ivansonic08> RONIN
[0:31:23] <JArcade> Is this Reggie Fil Aime's job after Nintendo?
[0:31:24] <%NovaKnightmare> fun fact: Lee's VA looks fucking Badass IRL
[0:31:27] <pistofficer> the consumables are really usefull in the game. debuffs actually mater
[0:31:28] <%skizzuto> Is his body ready tho
[0:31:29] <ivansonic08> *RODIN
[0:31:34] <+ALTRNico> Keep your hair short Pat
[0:31:50] <+Kairi__> I miss Paige and DS2‚Ä¶ sipsipGasm
[0:31:54] <cisealnine> Is that Dave Fennoy?
[0:31:55] <hottdogman> I'm really interested to see what the gameplay of this looks like
[0:31:59] <qwaizy> What difficulty is this?
[0:32:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat's hair is short, so he must be perfect for the zombie apocalypse.
[0:32:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Normal
[0:32:10] <Coystick> So tsun
[0:32:11] <ovan20> @connos_procrastination because no game ever before made your character to make motions and use time to heal, no game ever asked for materials for upgrades...souls games didn't started videogames bruh
[0:32:11] <Tersalus> fair trade
[0:32:19] <pistofficer> ]damn, ive only found 1 item drop in the first like 4 hours
[0:32:27] <%mckraven> I just looked up Lee's voice actor and that is one badass dude
[0:32:27] <CurrySauseBandit> That doesn't seem worth. But okay.
[0:32:28] <%keyworthe> hunter's mark is insanely good
[0:32:36] <%MonsieurHedge> all mask and no shoot make pat go crazy
[0:32:37] <%sileo_patronus> wider swings and 3-hit combo
[0:32:42] <+Despera__> @angriestpat Hunter‚Äôs mark is good, you see enemies through walls
[0:32:47] <MavMarsh> it's wallhacks
[0:32:48] <+Kairi__> Bloodborne references??
[0:32:54] <%keyworthe> wallhacks and crits
[0:32:55] <%arcaderabbit48> We really, really need a new name for this genre. Calling everything "Souls-like" is incredibly misleading in a lot of cases, despite being the only technically apt descriptor
[0:32:56] <BlazeTheRiolu> i'm thinking about getting this game, would you recommend it?
[0:32:59] <%MonsieurHedge> i dont bother w/ anything but the scrap hammer
[0:33:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Main thing that makes a "Souls like" is the unique checkpoint system.
[0:33:00] <+jjhoho> yeah apparently hammer is best melee
[0:33:07] <%MonsieurHedge> well, and SPOILERS WEAPONS
[0:33:08] <McAngrimStein> haa hoo haa
[0:33:09] <OhioNitsud> this game needs a compare button on the store
[0:33:14] <+griffball13> NOT UPGADED
[0:33:23] <+BurkeBigsby> This game is so much fun MP though
[0:33:27] <DaveStrider55> i cant believe you got that mask on the 1st playthrough
[0:33:29] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat what's the machete charge?
[0:33:29] <MavMarsh> problem with hammer is that it has a huge recovery on 3rd hit unless you roll
[0:33:31] <@SSaryn> Remenber, you got Charges too.
[0:33:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That's BRUTAL hammer
[0:33:38] <ovan20> @arcaderabbit48 i just use third person shooter, i hate people saying everything is souls rooREE
[0:33:44] <Coystick> That's a meat tenderizer
[0:33:49] <Tersalus> what a big strong man
[0:34:12] <DSD24> Go Sword
[0:34:13] <+jjhoho> hammer does great stagger
[0:34:15] <+BurkeBigsby> Neither. Melee is suck
[0:34:17] <%keyworthe> hammer is the best cause it's brutal as fuck
[0:34:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @ovan20 I usually tend towards 3rd Person Adventure? Like yeah, this one specifically is a third person shooter, but I also mean games like Code Vein and Nioh and whatnot
[0:34:20] <Coystick> Go hammer c'mon man you're not torn
[0:34:20] <%Eaglestrike117> swrod
[0:34:20] <%Swampykins> Sword is dope
[0:34:21] <Valdorick> Yeah, tough choice between the Fraggor or the Kronas
[0:34:22] <%cherubs_anonymous> Sord
[0:34:22] <+ALTRNico> hammer
[0:34:22] <McAngrimStein> sword
[0:34:23] <%skizzuto> hammer has bigger number
[0:34:24] <Dhurkst> @ovan20 Some Souls comparisons are valid, it's silly to get worked up by them
[0:34:24] <black_mages_matter_> i think we all know what time it is
[0:34:24] <+DireTroy> hammer
[0:34:25] <CaptainFrankincense> between the hammer and the anvil
[0:34:26] <$i_am_therydon> sword
[0:34:27] <killering5> sword
[0:34:27] <12gagerager> sword
[0:34:30] <McAngrimStein> she's not in the mood to chat
[0:34:31] <Intensebuttslap> sword
[0:34:32] <hottdogman> hammer looks pretty dope
[0:34:32] <%MonsieurHedge> yeah big hammer best for clearing chumps, and clearing chumps is all melee is good for basically
[0:34:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ovan20 I feel you but this is more soulsish then the usual games that people say is the dark souls of blank
[0:34:35] <IronGlorfindel> swooord
[0:34:38] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat Number go up with hammer
[0:34:38] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat looks like the sword hits diagonally.
[0:34:38] <%Piemen99> hammer time
[0:34:38] <@SSaryn> You'll either want something moderately fast or has massive stagger. Which Hammer has tons of Stagger.
[0:34:42] <%MonsieurHedge> ignoring, of course, the SPOILERS weapon
[0:34:44] <Coystick> boooo
[0:34:47] <%keyworthe> SWORD LUL
[0:34:47] <%poker4121> Hammer does big number
[0:34:48] <$drfaustisdead> charge that is.
[0:34:51] <DSD24> Sword Bois
[0:34:51] <mybigmeech> Y'all heard about the new iceborne demo coming out?
[0:34:51] <graemecrackers1> this is kinda bloodborne like
[0:34:58] <McAngrimStein> always bet on sword, sword always win
[0:35:00] <+kauze12> what're ya buying?
[0:35:06] <MavMarsh> is that a dex build
[0:35:06] <%Sovspot> Sovspot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Yup, 13 months.
[0:35:07] <%MonsieurHedge> chat are FOOOOLS
[0:35:07] <tanarath> Sword for you, the range will make up for clumbo.
[0:35:12] <$Brother_Coduss> 3
[0:35:13] <+l3sovikk> Finally, not a WOW Classic Stream
[0:35:13] <graemecrackers1> I ordered the bloodborne vinyl record @AngriestPat
[0:35:13] <%keyworthe> sword sucks balls
[0:35:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ovan20 It is unique in that it has a decent melee system and stamina while being a shooter, but yeah. I think it's also the checkpoint system that really gets people thinking Souls.
[0:35:16] <%keyworthe> hammer is the best
[0:35:16] <%arcaderabbit48> Its like Bloodborne, but without the setting, and the guns being good completely changes the gameplay
[0:35:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Drive me closer! I wish to hit them with my SWORD
[0:35:19] <WanderingSwordsman> how is this game?
[0:35:19] <Zombrocom> This game has an estus flask, bonfires, high difficulty, drop in co op, dodge rolls... obtuse lore and world, the only this could be more dark souls is if fromsoft made it
[0:35:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Go kill something
[0:35:26] <ovan20> @arcaderabbit48 for Nioh i just say it's like ninja gaiden, people the same team made it :P
[0:35:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Remember that lore
[0:35:44] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat what was your starting class?
[0:35:45] <DaveStrider55> i dont think anyone likes the sniper rifle
[0:35:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @ovan20 Also accurate, though not my immediate thought process since I've never actually played one of those
[0:35:51] <+ALTRNico> vaatiLore vaatiLore vaatiLore
[0:35:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[0:35:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 35m 57s.
[0:36:02] <Dhurkst> bearer seek seek lest
[0:36:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Warlock
[0:36:05] <%MonsieurHedge> sniper's outclassed by its boss weapon equivalent, which is sad
[0:36:05] <mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat I like the gear in this game, it's like a less trashy fallout
[0:36:06] <zv1neda> LUL
[0:36:12] <+BurkeBigsby> Spirit is amazing ability
[0:36:14] <%connos_procrastination> healey mod class
[0:36:15] <%keyworthe> GOTTA RESTART
[0:36:18] <black_mages_matter_> cultist is the best. the trait is the best and thats the only hard thing to get
[0:36:20] <%Calek> @MonsieurHedge is that the one with gravity powers?
[0:36:20] <%keyworthe> get the hunter gear
[0:36:26] <pistofficer> can you only have the main weapon and a side arm?
[0:36:30] <$Brother_Coduss> @MonsieurHedge shouldnt most weapons be outclassed by their boss weapon equivalent?
[0:36:31] <@SSaryn> Don't worry, if you picked the Hunter class, all you get is Less Enemy Awareness.
[0:36:33] <Dhurkst> @mistermastergreg how is Fallout "trashy"?
[0:36:34] <CaptainFrankincense> everyweapon is outclassed by its boss equiv
[0:36:35] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat I think you can just buy all of the other class weapons in Ward 13
[0:36:36] <%sjay449> you going to play shadowkeep pat? Or was getting back into D2 just a curiosity?
[0:36:38] <%MonsieurHedge> @Calek yeah the grav gun is just BETTER
[0:36:41] <black_mages_matter_> took me 4 earth runs to find the cultist trait
[0:36:41] <%arcaderabbit48> @pistofficer Main weapon, sidearm, and melee weapon I believe
[0:36:46] <%keyworthe> hunter gear gives BIG DMG
[0:36:48] <%keyworthe> NUMBER GO UO
[0:36:49] <+FennecZephyr> Class mods too
[0:36:49] <%starotter70> Off topic but I would love to see Pat do a Fallout 2 Stream
[0:36:51] <+jjhoho> the only boss weapons i've found so far feel really mediocre
[0:36:53] <Valdorick> OH! Now I see! This isn't Gunsouls! This is Hellgate: Lordran
[0:36:57] <black_mages_matter_> 7 if you include friend's games
[0:36:57] <%MonsieurHedge> @Brother_Coduss the magnum is better than its boss version, as is the shotgun and the beam rifle
[0:36:58] <%Calek> @MonsieurHedge I got that one and was so happy to read it's description, it's so cool
[0:37:03] <+BurkeBigsby> Hunter gear relies on range, though
[0:37:06] <WanderingSwordsman> boy that place looks like it belongs in darksiders
[0:37:06] <%RubberFistFight> howdy @AngriestPat
[0:37:10] <mistermastergreg> @Dhurkst idk, it just "feels" like that, you know? Idk how to explain it
[0:37:10] <+BurkeBigsby> Not gonna happen in any meaningful encounter
[0:37:11] <CaptainFrankincense> one boss level is two normal
[0:37:13] <%Sovspot> something about trees being enemies seems extremely boring
[0:37:14] <+jjhoho> i'm early tho
[0:37:21] <killering5> @valdorick b
[0:37:23] <%sileo_patronus> sploosh
[0:37:25] <+Thomzzz> oh wow this game looks surprisingly good graphically
[0:37:27] <killering5> rip hellgate
[0:37:28] <%MonsieurHedge> @Sovspot you aint seen NOTHIN yet
[0:37:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Valdorick lol damn, I haven't heard of that game in ages. Hellgate looked so rad.
[0:37:29] <DSD24> Stinger!
[0:37:30] <black_mages_matter_> thjat running attack is the best
[0:37:32] <borous> @MonsieurHedge the ent shotgun is worse than the other two? No was dog
[0:37:36] <borous> *no way
[0:37:40] <ovan20> @Sovspot enemy types change depending on the level
[0:37:42] <RiceeFTW> @Sovspot that's only for the first world
[0:37:44] <DSD24> Breakdown!
[0:37:45] <%arcaderabbit48> Everyone likes a stab. Except the people being stabbed, but fuck them
[0:37:50] <MavMarsh> you swim in titanite in this game
[0:37:54] <SirTeabottom> awh jeez man my bank account isn't ready for how much I wanna get this oh god oh jeez
[0:38:00] <%ThatOneGameTester> @killering5 i have a 4k updated version of hellgate running multiplayer right now
[0:38:06] <%MonsieurHedge> @borous sporebloom cant conclusively kill trash with its whopping 1 shot, compared to the shotty which absolutely can
[0:38:10] <RiceeFTW> @SirTeabottom i sold some csgo skins to buy this game :D
[0:38:13] <%arcaderabbit48> This area looks significantly more evil than the last
[0:38:29] <%MonsieurHedge> i'd rather use shotty + breath of the desert or swarm than the sporebloom in nay situation
[0:38:29] <Dhurkst> @mistermastergreg you mean that attack "feel" doesn't feel very polished?
[0:38:34] <+griffball13> blind
[0:38:37] <JDlightside> I think you can do a slide by pressing crouch while sprinting.
[0:38:42] <%arcaderabbit48> Wow, guns are accurate in this game. Even I could hit my target with that!
[0:38:44] <black_mages_matter_> best part about this game is theres not only 2 slabs in the whole playthrough
[0:38:49] <mistermastergreg> @Dhurkst no, just in terms of looks
[0:38:49] <MavMarsh> i want those dudes' capes
[0:38:50] <DSD24> Is this game fun solo?
[0:38:51] <Captain_Aham> this game okay without friends?
[0:38:53] <ScreamLord> So what is the synopsis of this game? I missed to first stream
[0:38:54] <%keyworthe> they are root
[0:38:58] <borous> @MonsieurHedge yeah that's not what it's for? also if you pump reload speed it can one shot any normal and the Aoe dot cleans house
[0:39:02] <+Grayhammatter> BIG number
[0:39:03] <%Stratiotai2> i am rooot
[0:39:11] <MavMarsh> wtf how did he unlock it already
[0:39:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> whats the story for this game so far?
[0:39:13] <+moranprime> Is this game spooky?
[0:39:14] <%Calek> the game's fun solo, it takes some extra work though since you dont' have anyone covering your back
[0:39:17] <TrollKing96> @AngriestPat I would like to see FromSoft's take on this type of gameplay.
[0:39:18] <%MonsieurHedge> @black_mages_matter_ worst part is slabs are totally random. i got 6 while a bud of mine got like... 2
[0:39:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Level up that DEEP stuff, Pat
[0:39:33] <%sjay449> "dark souls with guns" isn't that just bloodborne?
[0:39:34] <phrickshun> This game is fine to play solo. You might have some challenges to over come though but it's alright
[0:39:36] <b1gboss007> how much did i miss ?
[0:39:46] <mostundesired> More like inverse than opposite.
[0:39:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @DesuDesuDokiDoki End of the world scenario. Scientists were doing dream research in to parallel universes, and the parallel shit started leaking in to our world
[0:39:48] <ovan20> @DesuDesuDokiDoki interdimentional monsters that corrupt what they touch destroy Earth, go punch their asses
[0:39:50] <Valdorick> Armored Souls/Dark Cores, make it happen, FROM!
[0:39:51] <%keyworthe> @DesuDesuDokiDoki groot from guardians of the galaxy lands on earth and shit happens
[0:39:51] <JArcade> This is Bloodborne but they focused more on guns lol
[0:39:51] <%connos_procrastination> basic movement speed annoys me in this game for how much ground you have to cover
[0:39:54] <Dhurkst> @mistermastergreg You mean the piecemeal, macguyvered look of the weapons, like they were literally assembled from junk?
[0:39:55] <%PlainSimpleTailor> BUT IS BIG HARD THO?
[0:39:56] <+cicatjb> and big trench coats
[0:39:56] <iggdrafolium> Me leveling my bloodtinge to level 99 LUL
[0:39:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @b1gboss007 7boss fights
[0:39:58] <%MonsieurHedge> Literally Snailborne, but as a good thing this time
[0:40:02] <DSD24> The Melee is to supplement the Gunshooting
[0:40:09] <+moranprime> Hoontah must hunt
[0:40:09] <%MonsieurHedge> its shooty but slow in the nice way
[0:40:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i see
[0:40:15] <JArcade> Like this borrows HEAVILY from the Souls games
[0:40:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> shooty shooty bang bang
[0:40:32] <CaptainFrankincense> you can build a really strong melee in this game
[0:40:36] <RiceeFTW> the devs know how close it is to the souls series
[0:40:36] <Coystick> I think I like this, I got a couple buddies who'd be into it too
[0:40:36] <+cicatjb> the blood borne of shooters
[0:40:38] <$hepabuttlicker> This game is going to need more content to keep an audience. Its pretty short
[0:40:39] <+BurkeBigsby> Slide has I frames too, which is cool
[0:40:41] <mistermastergreg> @Dhurkst yup, fallout is more "grimey"
[0:40:44] <RiceeFTW> @CaptainFrankincense hggTom
[0:40:44] <JArcade> Like almost to a point of copyright issues lol
[0:40:44] <%MonsieurHedge> im so fuckin excited to see pat progress past this first area. shit gets weird
[0:40:47] <%Toast_Master_General> Thats a big ol' fuck stick right there
[0:40:47] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat So what's the story for this? Trees are evil and the apocolypse happened because of evil trees?
[0:40:51] <Tersalus> who is this man and why does he hate furniture?
[0:40:55] <+JustToWatch> welp, time to give up
[0:40:56] <%sjay449> It's like that RPG from 2011 with guns
[0:41:00] <+BurkeBigsby> And jump back aswell, makign it useful for counter attacks
[0:41:02] <+MisoPhat_> I love that the game is procedure generated. So every run will be a bit different.
[0:41:05] <black_mages_matter_> @MonsieurHedge yeah im the only one of my friends with 10 dragon hearts lmao. though i did play a lot more too. still, you can easily find 2 just in earth, and thats better than 2 in the entire game
[0:41:08] <RiceeFTW> destroy furniture for scrap which is money Pog
[0:41:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @ScreamLord Also dream Stands and parallel universes, but basically yeah
[0:41:16] <%MonsieurHedge> @ScreamLord the government did a Stranger Things, lost, and now trees have fucked everyone to death
[0:41:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hya! Hu! Hya!
[0:41:18] <%ThatOneGameTester> @ScreamLord alternate dimension nightmare creatures iirc
[0:41:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ScreamLord dummy scientists were lokking into paralel worlds and brought some shit home
[0:41:26] <McAngrimStein> it's like a less shit Immortal Unchained
[0:41:27] <Coystick> You're making a mess how dare
[0:41:36] <+moranprime> Dark Souls 2 falling damage? Kappa
[0:41:38] <+ALTRNico> Is there no equipment degradation in this game?
[0:41:42] <%keyworthe> @McAngrimStein holy shit it is
[0:41:44] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Why is there a face hugger on your ...face
[0:41:51] <%Typhaeon> I like the idea of shooting eldritch monsters in the face with slug rounds
[0:41:52] <RiceeFTW> no equipment degrade
[0:41:55] <+cicatjb> roll into breakables
[0:41:55] <%MonsieurHedge> @KitsuneManami health regen > sanity
[0:41:57] <RiceeFTW> no need to repair anything
[0:41:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Also war fucked up and activated the appocolpse early /s
[0:41:59] <MavMarsh> yeah this game has really good gameplay to work off of but it could use more content
[0:41:59] <+ALTRNico> k tnx
[0:42:06] <+griffball13> something under that desk
[0:42:06] <+MisoPhat_> Some bosses may have special drops if you do something specific (shoot tail, body, etc)
[0:42:08] <RiceeFTW> ofc you can roll to destroy stuff, it's a souls game :^)
[0:42:11] <Dhurkst> @mistermastergreg I gotcha.
[0:42:23] <brandanvh> This makes me want Fromsoft to make a new Shadow Tower.
[0:42:24] <borous> @doc_ock_rokc war did nothing wrong
[0:42:25] <McAngrimStein> Tree Souls
[0:42:26] <ScreamLord> So it evil Cthulhu Trees that fucked the Earth because scientists did a Doom? Got it
[0:42:34] <+kauze12> landscape looks like nier automata
[0:42:34] <%MonsieurHedge> remember, WOOD is the ENEMY. destroy ALL wood, furniture is just root sympathizers
[0:42:41] <RiceeFTW> i think of the trees more like the Flood from Halo
[0:42:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay but what if you made furniture out of a Root?
[0:42:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Isn't furniture just slave root?
[0:42:58] <%Typhaeon> HONK
[0:42:58] <CaptainFrankincense> nah the root is kinda your fault
[0:43:00] <transporterthesequel> But what of our own wood!
[0:43:01] <RiceeFTW> then you get evil furniture
[0:43:03] <%sileo_patronus> Can't wait for a mimic bookshelf
[0:43:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Live footage of streamer cutting wood
[0:43:05] <Blackjack760> Cursed you trees!
[0:43:09] <McAngrimStein> "The room's barren save for broken glass and splinters, Pat's been through here"
[0:43:09] <+Ell1ot> i thought twitter said that it was Paige's job to destroy all wood
[0:43:11] <%ThatOneGameTester> @arcaderabbit48 live or dead?
[0:43:15] <+oOZtkOo> what was the last boss pat fought?
[0:43:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Rootmother
[0:43:23] <MavMarsh> church
[0:43:23] <%MonsieurHedge> chest
[0:43:35] <+jjhoho> ye hammer just has more
[0:43:37] <%dekkitout> First we start with the Amazon, then the Root
[0:43:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Didn't fight her, but yeah
[0:43:42] <McAngrimStein> I'd root that mother
[0:43:43] <%Nobrev> howdy Pat, and howdy Chat. wassup?
[0:43:43] <%sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat is the stagger long enough for a charge swing?
[0:43:43] <StaticSunrise> the birch bitch
[0:43:46] <transporterthesequel> Sister Friede got it
[0:43:47] <ovan20> tree mother isn't a boss, is a gauntlet LUL
[0:43:50] <%Shadicara> Pat if you're going meele bust out the shotgun too
[0:43:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @ThatOneGameTester I assumed dead, but if you could trap a living Root and turn it in to a chair then I would be even more impressed
[0:43:53] <%sjay449> if all these enemies are tree's wouldn't a flamethrower be OP?
[0:43:53] <%MonsieurHedge> Warframe Defense Mission.png
[0:43:54] <%connos_procrastination> sap girl
[0:43:54] <+TheSaintJohn> everyone fights the root mother, but its not really a boss
[0:43:55] <redial_nick> muther
[0:43:58] <+AmanDotZip> gonna stream WoW?
[0:43:59] <cstigerwright> @AngriestPat Are you going to stream Astral Chain?
[0:43:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> This game is perfect for Pat- he hates the environment
[0:43:59] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh you mean the Corrupted Greatwood? Kappa
[0:43:59] <black_mages_matter_> depending on what boss you get next, you might get Rathalos sword soon
[0:44:00] <+ALTRNico> so tree huggers are the enemies got it
[0:44:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Sassy Sapper
[0:44:06] <%starotter70> Do you think she cums Sap?
[0:44:06] <ScreamLord> Remember kids, burn the Amazon before it eats us all
[0:44:19] <%sileo_patronus> corrupted greatwood can fuck off
[0:44:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cstigerwright It's on the schedule
[0:44:26] <black_mages_matter_> will do
[0:44:30] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat throw your face hugger at it
[0:44:31] <%sileo_patronus> understood
[0:44:34] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> its only the big bosses that have alternate kill cons
[0:44:37] <SleepyMaribo> just hit the weak spot
[0:44:37] <%skizzuto> wow these guys have terrible aim
[0:44:40] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> you havnt fought one yet
[0:44:43] <%MonsieurHedge> alt kills are literally just tailcuts and kneecaps.
[0:44:45] <transporterthesequel> why does the wood have GUNS
[0:44:46] <%ThatOneGameTester> @arcaderabbit48 i imagien it would look like the infested chair in warframe
[0:44:48] <Blackjack760> I knew the great Deku Tree was evil
[0:44:50] <Grunkle_Dan_> did kinda sound like you called us assholes LUL
[0:44:53] <transporterthesequel> Why do trees have guns!?
[0:44:54] <MavMarsh> some of them are a bit weirder
[0:44:55] <%keyworthe> you say "bitch" at every guy you one shot
[0:44:55] <%MonsieurHedge> so, when in doubt, hit the legs.
[0:44:57] <ovan20> @AngriestPat alternate ways of killing don't help a first playthorugh, you only get one item from the boss
[0:44:58] <%arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Moooooooom, Dad called us assholes!
[0:44:58] <%ThatOneGameTester> imagine WutFace
[0:45:01] <transporterthesequel> Do all tree's have guns?!
[0:45:08] <cstigerwright> @GeneralSCPatton Didn't even notice, thanks for pointing it out
[0:45:08] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @MonsieurHedge thats only for this zone
[0:45:10] <Tersalus> is pat playing on easy or just doing really well?
[0:45:13] <MavMarsh> what, no, you can totally get them first playthrough
[0:45:19] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat i jsut hope you didnt get a shitty roll on your world and get one of the shitty bosses first, that seems to have ruined Jim Sterlings opinion on the game.
[0:45:20] <CaptainFrankincense> nah alt kills can be skill based as well
[0:45:25] <black_mages_matter_> did you shoot the root mother's tail off?
[0:45:27] <%connos_procrastination> nah
[0:45:27] <MavMarsh> i got the singe sword first thing
[0:45:30] <pistofficer> damn, manybe only ever using the shotgun was a bad ide. i gotta try this rifle for solo things
[0:45:35] <+griffball13> DOG WELDIER
[0:45:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[0:45:38] <%Walkerartorias> @AngriestPat pat are we allowed to tell you about stuff you missed?
[0:45:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck yeah!
[0:45:41] <%MonsieurHedge> @heckubrickyillneverdie Harrow has leg kill, dont he?

[0:46:05] <%Gray_skies1993> apatDab

[0:46:08] <derekwst3> dog wielder such a dumb character
[0:46:08] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @MonsieurHedge yeah but then you have to interact with the harpoon on his back after you stagger him

[0:46:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its like the mandilorian but it actually looks intresting
[0:46:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Are Mandalorians overrated or underrated in the Star Wars universe?
[0:46:24] <MavMarsh> he got the sniper
[0:46:29] <%MonsieurHedge> @heckubrickyillneverdie still, "shoot legs" is a good, conside way of establishing that
[0:46:34] <%Sh00s> PUBG man in a a Fallout land
[0:46:34] <R3c0n31> so missed content is free to talk, special way of bosses but not spoilers of future. noice
[0:46:38] <%Typhaeon> Nothing goes over Pat's head
[0:46:39] <%dekkitout> Mandalorians are uber overrated

[0:46:44] <CaptainFrankincense> except its not handled like a souls game
[0:46:45] <%PaladinDupre> except the muffin man's addresss
[0:46:45] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @MonsieurHedge and the other boss option besides harrow you have to let the boss absorb an enemy/ not absorb depending on which one you want
[0:46:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @GarbageQueenEllie underrated and underutilized
[0:46:49] <black_mages_matter_> i swear to god if you find the monkey key here
[0:46:55] <derekwst3> welcome to heaven
[0:46:55] <SleepyMaribo> wait there was a rifle in the basement?

[0:49:05] <%MonsieurHedge> or boss hammers. both of those are good
[0:49:05] <mostundesired> Damn, I wasn't really paying attention last stream. This game looks tasty.
[0:49:05] <%arcaderabbit48> People talking about how much they've had to reroll for important items really, really does not inspire confidence
[0:49:06] <Tucker0603> lol
[0:49:06] <thelonechris> monkaS
[0:49:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[0:49:07] <+jjhoho> maybe no smack the suicide bombers

[0:49:08] <McAngrimStein> that's kablamo
[0:49:09] <+punit216> LUL
[0:49:09] <borous> @AngriestPat There is no way for chat to tell you what you missed or did not and there is no way to know what you will find or miss because even the way forward is randomized

[0:49:25] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[0:49:26] <ovan20> @AngriestPat if there's a cristal, that's progress. If there's a bonfire and you can only exit from where you came in, that's a dungeon

[0:49:46] <+RealPT1> don't forget strong pat

[0:50:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Is there a mod to download that forces items to drop? Because I do not have time to roll multiple areas just to find one key
[0:50:09] <%MonsieurHedge> the consequences are NOTHING
[0:50:09] <RiceeFTW> EXCEPT YOUR TIME
[0:50:10] <killering5> o
[0:50:11] <ZE_Count> Except time I guess
[0:50:11] <RiceeFTW> AND CONSUMABLES
[0:50:12] <%Piemen99> ??????????????
[0:50:13] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat i saw your sinking city videos, why did you stop? just not feeling it?

[0:50:22] <%keyworthe> YOU LOSE TIME PAT
[0:50:23] <Tersalus> no consequences? I got a highway I gotta lie down in!!
[0:50:25] <killering5> PixelBob
[0:50:27] <%king_wragles> so it's Bordlands X Dark Souls?
[0:50:27] <koffeemancer> At most you lose progess
[0:50:27] <Coystick> Na-and I cannot stress this enough-ni?
[0:50:28] <%dekkitout> Wow, that's a huge improvement Kappa
[0:50:28] <%Calek> why would use consumables you could die!
[0:50:28] <garbageheaphound> how do ya feel bout that?
[0:50:29] <+Grayhammatter> it's only the items you used
[0:50:31] <RiceeFTW> you lose TIME, you lose YOUR LIFE
[0:50:32] <%keyworthe> YOU LOSE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME
[0:50:34] <Zombrocom> Which lets them make bosses bullshit add fests I guess
[0:50:34] <CaptainFrankincense> souls stole that from diablo anyway
[0:50:35] <%keyworthe> YOU DIE AT THE END OF LIFE
[0:50:37] <%keyworthe> SPOLER
[0:50:41] <+TheStarvingGood> Time is the ultimate consumable
[0:50:42] <killering5> ah
[0:50:42] <RupanSen> time is meaningless for an immortal toilet
[0:50:44] <%Louie_Salmon> Time is the ultimate consumable
[0:50:44] <McAngrimStein> what game lets you not lose time
[0:50:46] <McAngrimStein> it's always ticking
[0:50:50] <McAngrimStein> the incessant clock
[0:50:53] <Tersalus> dying makes you killed
[0:51:00] <black_mages_matter_> yeah you lose nothing on death. its really nice for a randomized game like this
[0:51:03] <$hepabuttlicker> Fun fact WoW classic servers are 10K+ in queue
[0:51:05] <Dhurkst> No consequences for death in a soulslike? Laaaaaame
[0:51:05] <+yandereboyfriend> is this a shlooter?
[0:51:06] <RiceeFTW> people die when they are killed :'(
[0:51:09] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Which class are you running?
[0:51:11] <%connos_procrastination> Dont let it set in
[0:51:11] <%ThatOneGameTester> The eventual heat death of the universe is unavoidable, living forever means witnissing the end.
[0:51:12] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat inb4: actually you get the worst ending possible
[0:51:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> What if a game had the balls to have an invisible timer for every time you die until Game Over
[0:51:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @yandereboyfriend kinda
[0:51:23] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat upgrade heart
[0:51:24] <%ThatOneGameTester> you are breathing manually
[0:51:25] <black_mages_matter_> hunting rifle and smg is a good combo. i use that even after beating the game
[0:51:27] <%keyworthe> just reminding chat that we will all die one day, pat will tho probably die first
[0:51:29] <+demon_shadowplays> sounds like a souls game for filthy casuals...
[0:51:31] <ovan20> @ScreamLord theres no classes in this game
[0:51:34] <Tersalus> I can hardly believe this is procedural, everything seems so seamless
[0:51:35] <%Theophilus567> Is this game on PS4?
[0:51:36] <%AllyBeeBoo> @hepabuttlicker wow!
[0:51:40] <killering5> da faq are the crystals?
[0:51:43] <RiceeFTW> mini crystal = dungeon, big crystal = world zone
[0:51:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Hammer for apatBig and STRONG
[0:51:44] <cosmicdischarge> it does
[0:51:45] <%Lurantis_> Did you guys know that pencils are twice as good as pens, and that disagreeing is punishable by death?
[0:51:48] <ConneD> well would say it is like darksouls + hellgate london feel for it
[0:51:48] <%SolverCODO> Wait is this game a Dark Souls?
[0:51:50] <black_mages_matter_> you'll find so many simulacummies it doesnt matter
[0:51:52] <CrypticMochi> Any long dead ends that make dying a viable fast travel?
[0:51:58] <Smart_ZaK1> Is this the dark souls of shlooters?
[0:52:01] <black_mages_matter_> dont even need a +20 weapon at the end of the game
[0:52:03] <MavMarsh> it is highly unlikely that you'll get to the point you need titanite slabs in a first playthrough
[0:52:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @crypticmochi yep
[0:52:04] <majindusto> When More Clumbo?
[0:52:06] <Doomed2Die> it's random I only found 4 in my game and I scoured the world
[0:52:08] <RiceeFTW> mini crystal = dungeon, big crystal = world zones
[0:52:10] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @solvercodo yes but with a gun
[0:52:13] <Tersalus> mudcrabs?
[0:52:13] <MavMarsh> you might not even get to +15
[0:52:14] <ovan20> @AngriestPat you'll only use it in the end of the game as upgrade, 15 hours in, upgrade your healing
[0:52:17] <+Undenizen> oh hey, I actually caught a stream. Hi Pat!
[0:52:19] <+moranprime> is that Steve Blum? LUL
[0:52:25] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have any interest in playing this game multiplayer?
[0:52:27] <%SolverCODO> The Dark Souls of Guns
[0:52:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> raifu <3
[0:52:34] <RiceeFTW> the better question is, is it ever not steve blum?
[0:52:35] <+Grayhammatter> those are NOT fuzzies
[0:52:39] <McAngrimStein> this is my rifle, this is my gun
[0:52:39] <killering5> gunsouls
[0:52:41] <Smart_ZaK1> Gun Souls
[0:52:44] <ConneD> they are no match for anything :P i just hammer time them
[0:52:45] <Smart_ZaK1> fuck
[0:52:47] <ScreamLord> @ovan20 The wiki says otherwise, but I guess this runs on a Souls-like class system in that start as one thing and then become whatever the fuck you want
[0:52:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gunborne!
[0:52:51] <borous> @AngriestPat you won't need a simulaicrum until +20 gear so get more healies, they are not that rare
[0:52:52] <Tersalus> Gun Dark
[0:52:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat Oh, is Simulacrum a Slab? You still have Forged Iron and Galvanized Iron to go through before you need that.
[0:52:57] <IronGlorfindel> is there anything as satisfying as spraying into the fog and hearing enemies die?
[0:52:57] <+StewTheGreat> it's the titanite slab, but you find them pretty often and you shouldn't hit max item level anytime soon or you're going to overscale the areas
[0:52:59] <redial_nick> "it's like dark souls but with guns"
[0:53:09] <+StewTheGreat> I have 6 heals right now and 2 simulacrum in my pocket
[0:53:10] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat why arent you joining the rest of the sheep and playing WoW Classic? :P
[0:53:14] <+Undenizen> So hey, what's this game about?
[0:53:16] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have any interest in playing this game multiplayer?
[0:53:17] <$hepabuttlicker> Anyone seen the forest dudes that do the Howard Dean scream?
[0:53:19] <Tersalus> Remnant: The Spooky Gun
[0:53:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> They are roots
[0:53:24] <ovan20> @ScreamLord the wiki is wrong, there's no classes, it's only starting kits and you can easily buy all equipment

[0:56:04] <Jontman42> So is this game good
[0:56:04] <+DireTroy> Is the loot randomly placed, or is it the same each playthrough?
[0:56:07] <+Undenizen> @AngriestPat Hey, Control is out tomorrow. it's a 3rd person shooter based on Plato's cave allegory and the forms. It seems right up your alley!
[0:56:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[0:56:08] <%ThatOneGameTester> wow that is agressive
[0:56:09] <%Calek> randomly placed

[0:56:11] <RiceeFTW> you've gotten the magnum, ring of evasion, a simulacrum early, etc
[0:56:12] <$hepabuttlicker> In the midnight hour he yelled meow meow meow
[0:56:13] <SleepyMaribo> if hes playing on pc, multi would have to be with friends, if he joins a random game and the host happens to be cheating, it affects you as well.
[0:56:18] <ChloroShepard> it was elmo all along
[0:56:19] <%GarbageNirvana> What if Pat never gets another run like this
[0:56:21] <ConneD> give this game 10/10 for gamplay and 10/10 for multiplayer
[0:56:22] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> its semi random
[0:56:23] <+DireTroy> neat
[0:56:24] <Dhurkst> All according to elmo's plan
[0:56:24] <Doomed2Die> elmo confirmed root creature
[0:56:27] <Coystick> Roguelike?
[0:56:27] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> its constructed of blocks
[0:56:29] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat what does this ring do?
[0:56:32] <%MonsieurHedge> i mean its a LITTLE random
[0:56:33] <%GarbageNirvana> What if Pat's blown all his run luck on this first playthrough
[0:56:33] <+oOZtkOo> its a slab and estus shard
[0:56:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Is this a Shlooter?
[0:56:36] <%XzileGaming> this is what HELLGATE london shoulda been
[0:56:36] <RiceeFTW> also big rando drop
[0:56:36] <+oOZtkOo> so pick
[0:56:38] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Did you see Jim Sterlings video on this saying its dull borin crap?
[0:56:40] <+razzoth> its basically an estus shard
[0:56:40] <Coystick> Gun Souls feat. Chalice Dungeons
[0:56:40] <RiceeFTW> no just for heart
[0:56:41] <%ThatOneGameTester> i felt the auto aim hands of gods pull the crosshair
[0:56:41] <black_mages_matter_> ye
[0:56:43] <RiceeFTW> it's estus shad
[0:56:45] <%MonsieurHedge> you CAN get infinite by rerolling
[0:56:45] <RiceeFTW> *shard
[0:56:45] <ivansonic08> its a SOULS LIKE
[0:56:47] <+StewTheGreat> it's for the last upgrade but you won't do that for a long time
[0:56:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> s h u t t h e f u c k u p e l m o
[0:56:53] <+StewTheGreat> and they're pretty common
[0:56:56] <black_mages_matter_> all weapons
[0:56:56] <%MonsieurHedge> but yeah its both an estus shard and slab
[0:56:56] <+LetsStartaRyate> Both
[0:56:57] <+StewTheGreat> get some more heals
[0:57:00] <@SSaryn> Both
[0:57:00] <RiceeFTW> you'll get some eventually
[0:57:00] <%walternatorz> boss weapons??
[0:57:02] <borous> It's for the FINAL rank gear upgrade and estus upgrade, so upgrading estus if fine
[0:57:04] <%MonsieurHedge> for all weapons
[0:57:06] <RiceeFTW> but no need to worry about it for now
[0:57:10] <ovan20> @AngriestPat simulacrum is only used for +20 upgrades, when you're into endgame, upgrading your healing instead
[0:57:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'LL GET INFINITE OF THEM ANYWAYS
[0:57:18] <+griffball13> yes
[0:57:20] <Coystick> EMLO
[0:57:20] <Ion_Laser> Yes
[0:57:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> meeeoooooww
[0:57:20] <Dhurkst> MREOW
[0:57:22] <I_am_Norwegian> lionStop
[0:57:25] <%starotter70> Is that Elmo or Paige?
[0:57:28] <%MonsieurHedge> i'd prioritize estus to 6, then hold for weapons
[0:57:29] <tanarath> he screm
[0:57:30] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat what does this ring do?
[0:57:31] <%skizzuto> yes, Elmo is very loud and cannot be silenced
[0:57:31] <+DireTroy> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:57:32] <Smart_ZaK1> Elmo screams give you strength
[0:57:33] <bruno_silv0> hiw are the bosses in this game?
[0:57:34] <black_mages_matter_> you'll probably find at least 6 simulacrums before you can get a weapon to +20
[0:57:36] <Dhurkst> Give the baby what he needs! D:
[0:57:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @starotter70 both
[0:57:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how the lever action gets some respect in this game. Good accuracy, good damage, decent fire rate, good range.
[0:57:39] <bruno_silv0> how*
[0:57:40] <GoDZooKii> Max upgrades 20. You won't need it for several hours.
[0:57:41] <%Crankypancake> Crankypancake subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Your constant shilling for FF14 has finally cracked me. Any suggestions on a fun starter class for someone that typically likes summoner classes?
[0:57:44] <+alpharius88> paige or elmo?
[0:57:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> simalacrashamalamadingdong
[0:57:51] <Smart_ZaK1> Headshot
[0:57:53] <MavMarsh> HEADSHOT
[0:57:59] <curechan9> is paige taunting the cat ?
[0:58:05] <%starotter70> @doc_ock_rokc Paaaaaaaaaat apatPorgmo
[0:58:07] <%PaladinDupre> Ran head first into that fireball eh?
[0:58:12] <ConneD> well in this game you only need like max 7 dragonhearts, rest you use 2 upgrade weapon 20
[0:58:16] <RiceeFTW> INFECTED
[0:58:16] <Ner234> ! INFECTED !
[0:58:16] <Smart_ZaK1> RUN
[0:58:20] <I_am_Norwegian> monkaW
[0:58:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[0:58:34] <%MonsieurHedge> !SHIT'S FUCKED!
[0:58:34] <ConneD> use oil to take infected
[0:58:34] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> The more I watch the more I'm disinterested in playing, unfortunately. I hoped that this game had more to offer
[0:58:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> What does infected do even?
[0:58:35] <RiceeFTW> this is probably the most annoying status effect ever
[0:58:37] <+oOZtkOo> infected interrupts animations
[0:58:37] <+Jimboq> BrainSlug
[0:58:38] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat it interupts your actions
[0:58:38] <+Grayhammatter> use that oilskin tonic bruh
[0:58:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Your character has AIDS now
[0:58:41] <ConneD> oilskin
[0:58:41] <MavMarsh> look at the top left
[0:58:41] <derekwst3> dont touch pat, he is infected
[0:58:42] <pistofficer> makes ya cough as an interupt
[0:58:43] <+moranprime> Rabiessss
[0:58:44] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> it justes intterupt ur shit with coughs
[0:58:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> COUGHS
[0:58:45] <%MonsieurHedge> it just staggers you every so often, basically
[0:58:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I thought it would prevent healing, but it didn't.
[0:58:46] <+jjhoho> makes you cough but idk what else
[0:58:47] <ScreamLord> It kills you and you die
[0:58:48] <%ItsRatman> Infected gives you the Lupus, dont be infected
[0:58:48] <%MonsieurHedge> very annoying
[0:59:05] <%connos_procrastination> cmonBruh
[0:59:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Okay, it's not too bad then.
[0:59:13] <black_mages_matter_> its basically TB
[0:59:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Infected gives you the Paige debuff
[0:59:18] <thebrownsauce> Infected does slow dot and stops you from sprinting occasionally
[0:59:31] <pistofficer> that was a life saver in the church fight
[0:59:34] <+jjhoho> is that the best mod? that feels like the best mod so far for me
[0:59:34] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat same it took me forever to realize it wasn't grayed out.
[0:59:38] <xeros720> if that ignore mod works in boss fights, that sounds amazing
[0:59:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> yeah, the dots in this game seem very slow from what I've seen.
[0:59:43] <GoDZooKii> Has Pat fought a actual boss? Or just mini?
[0:59:43] <%keyworthe> @AngriestPat hunter's mark pat
[0:59:45] <Smart_ZaK1> That's a plumbus
[0:59:47] <bruno_silv0> are guns rare? cuz i have yet to see one drop on stream today
[0:59:50] <CaptainFrankincense> infected interrupts
[0:59:53] <Ericgi231> If I recall this dungeon gives a great gun
[0:59:58] <%connos_procrastination> tome of brain

[1:00:05] <thebrownsauce> The explosive shot mod and the distraction mod have saved my ass soooo many times
[1:00:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bruno_silv0 they don't drop nessisarily
[1:00:09] <ConneD> just missed it
[1:00:10] <CurrySauseBandit> rooBlind
[1:00:11] <holis_crayolis> chat was the soft-cap in elder knowlede,or should i put 20 points into it?
[1:00:11] <+BurkeBigsby> Guns don't just drop liek aloot shooter. They usually come from bosses or specific quest like things
[1:00:12] <+Hicks1942> Hello, everyone. o/
[1:00:12] <+griffball13> you looked at a chest
[1:00:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> God dammit, I can't stand wasting points on XP gain. You're gonna level up anyways.
[1:00:13] <%Toast_Master_General> chest
[1:00:13] <MrJoeJoe> chest blind
[1:00:17] <CrypticMochi> sipsipSipsipblind
[1:00:20] <WanderingSwordsman> wished it was called eldritch knowledge

[1:00:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> chest
[1:00:25] <xeros720> HONK
[1:00:25] <RiceeFTW> exactly
[1:00:26] <black_mages_matter_> eldritch knowledge
[1:00:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Is there not a limit to levels?
[1:00:33] <%Toast_Master_General> big blind
[1:00:34] <%InugamiTheHound> yes
[1:00:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'M HELPFUL
[1:00:39] <MavMarsh> backstep has 2 less iframes than roll apparently
[1:00:43] <+jjhoho> game says limit is like a thousand lol
[1:00:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Amazing chest ahead
[1:00:45] <MavMarsh> default roll
[1:00:45] <%Calek> I would imagine the limit to levels is having all the traits maxed
[1:00:45] <+Jimboq> amazing chest
[1:00:45] <RiceeFTW> you can 100% max every single trait in the game
[1:00:46] <%Toast_Master_General> Next to room exit
[1:00:49] <$i_am_therydon> bo pat your paige blind which is worse.
[1:00:49] <%TwinBat> pat needs the big eye juice
[1:00:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> good job pat <3
[1:00:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Okay, that's fucking cool then.
[1:00:55] <xeros720> i love being able to max out
[1:00:56] <+Hicks1942> Your character looks like the cover art for Fallout New Vegas.
[1:01:02] <RiceeFTW> there's A LOT of traits
[1:01:04] <Tersalus> make this man's eyes bigger!
[1:01:05] <%MonsieurHedge> 20 per trait, max level is 640
[1:01:06] <%starotter70> Does Paige have to put spotlights on her boobs for Pat to see them?
[1:01:09] <+BurkeBigsby> @Doomed2Die Backstep ahs I frames. Best way of countering.
[1:01:13] <xeros720> does the class you pick at the start matter at all? or just starting stuff?
[1:01:14] <curechan9> tell paige stop arguing with the cat .
[1:01:14] <%MonsieurHedge> so max whatever the fuck you want
[1:01:14] <Zudrag> EK might not be worth maxing if you don't do multiple playthroughs
[1:01:15] <+StewTheGreat> trait levels also don't count for difficulty scaling
[1:01:15] <Smart_ZaK1> Okay that guy sounded like a darksouls enemy
[1:01:20] <Coystick> BIG IIRRRROOOON

[1:02:15] <OhioNitsud> he's a good boy and very headstrong
[1:02:16] <ovan20> @AngriestPat if there's a cristal, that's progress. If there's a bonfire and you can only exit from where you came in, that's a dungeon
[1:02:19] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat so how is your sister? did she get her mcdonalds for the day?
[1:02:20] <+TheSaintJohn> its not a dungeon unless its underground (most of the time)
[1:02:21] <black_mages_matter_> oh lawd
[1:02:22] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> its the miniboss checkpoint
[1:02:25] <+griffball13> boss time

[1:02:46] <%MonsieurHedge> THE WORST IT'S EVER BEEN
[1:02:51] <%totesmcgoat_> Is this Anor Londo?
[1:02:52] <RiceeFTW> remember yall, it's not a fog wall, it's a smoke gate LUL
[1:02:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Try feeding him peanut butter- then his mouth will be stuck together for a few minutes and he won't screm
[1:02:54] <MavMarsh> i hope it's enchanter mangler
[1:02:55] <%MonsieurHedge> this fight is a fucking nightmare
[1:02:58] <+TheSaintJohn> Treeman here we go
[1:02:59] <GoDZooKii> Mangle time GL
[1:03:01] <xeros720> mongler
[1:03:05] <CaptainFrankincense> this boss can have one modifier that can make it fucked up
[1:03:05] <+jjhoho> yeah i hated this little bitch
[1:03:06] <+BurkeBigsby> This fight is easy, lol.
[1:03:06] <McAngrimStein> yeah it's Anor Londo, you can tell by the modern office buildings in ruin
[1:03:08] <RiceeFTW> monkaS
[1:03:09] <RiceeFTW> blanka
[1:03:09] <black_mages_matter_> i think they took out the explosions
[1:03:09] <SleepyMaribo> its shit boss time!!!!
[1:03:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm just kidding, don't do that
[1:03:11] <xeros720> ahaha, i missed the fog doors last stream
[1:03:12] <+Snirtax> Man this section of the game was just completely different for me. That guy didn't even show up
[1:03:14] <RiceeFTW> stinky blanka mains
[1:03:15] <%starotter70> Oh
[1:03:15] <+gerenago> blanka?
[1:03:17] <Ericgi231> Oh, I got a different boss in this dungeon. Never seen this man.
[1:03:17] <%Gogogolem> Its sanic
[1:03:18] <+griffball13> REGENERATOR
[1:03:18] <derekwst3> I call him smilly
[1:03:19] <xeros720> it's one of those things from Twilight Princess
[1:03:20] <MavMarsh> oh okay it's not as bad
[1:03:21] <jeffishype> Bad boss design
[1:03:21] <%MonsieurHedge> AWW
[1:03:25] <jeffishype> Adds = Bad
[1:03:25] <%MonsieurHedge> no enchanter
[1:03:26] <BrachyZoid> Rolling around at the speed of sound~
[1:03:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> GATTA GO FYAST!
[1:03:29] <Futurecity10> WHEEL SKELETONS
[1:03:29] <SleepyMaribo> thats super unlucky getting mangler right off the bat
[1:03:29] <Jontman42> Get mangled
[1:03:36] <OhioNitsud> pat sees him rollin, he hatin
[1:03:38] <borous> get mongoloided
[1:03:39] <Valdorick> Gank Squad?
[1:03:39] <+TheSaintJohn> its the Boost Ball Guardian from Metroid Prime 2!
[1:03:40] <I_am_Norwegian> It's edge of tomorrow
[1:03:40] <%dekkitout> So it's a Mang Bamg
[1:03:41] <%MonsieurHedge> you ready for ROYAL TREE AUTHORITY
[1:03:42] <SpaceGuntank> mobs galore
[1:03:42] <RiceeFTW> @jeffishype yeah until you run out of ammo and you have to melee the bosses to death lol
[1:03:42] <+Undenizen> what's the plot of this?
[1:03:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Grenades would be so useful right now lol
[1:03:45] <$drfaustisdead> Most of the bosses have to be adds because of ammo.
[1:03:48] <xeros720> good call on tha tmod
[1:03:52] <derekwst3> kill the adds
[1:03:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Use the bomba
[1:03:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> HAMMER TIME BRUH!
[1:03:57] <Doomed2Die> smg is so good for those little guys
[1:04:04] <+CaptainJax> Pat help my WoW que is ten hours
[1:04:04] <%SolverCODO> quick use your gun!
[1:04:06] <MavMarsh> if he rolls into the wall he gets stunned
[1:04:08] <RiceeFTW> smg is so good.
[1:04:08] <+jjhoho> gotta say, magnum one hitting those nerds made this fight far more manageable
[1:04:08] <+griffball13> why don't you hiut them with your hammer
[1:04:17] <%pilgrimsayswhat> that hitbox
[1:04:21] <$drfaustisdead> I hate this boss, haven't managed to be it.
[1:04:23] <+cosinity> This boss with Enchanter was one of the most infuriating things I've ever fought
[1:04:30] <SydSavage> My friend got the enchanter subtrait on this boss and got root rot explosioned to hell
[1:04:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Words cannot express how un-intimidated I am by this screaming tumble weed
[1:04:38] <Smart_ZaK1> The ads seem to respawn right after you kill them
[1:04:40] <+moranprime> Rolling around at the speed of sound
[1:04:45] <%sileo_patronus> Hammer looks bad for crowd control
[1:04:45] <xeros720> it's the kind of boss that seems to punish certain builds
[1:04:49] <ConneD> why not rpg all the time ?
[1:04:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hammersmack those children, Pat! Hammer them ALL
[1:04:54] <+Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[1:04:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 4m.
[1:05:00] <SleepyMaribo> @xeros720 thats every boss in this game
[1:05:01] <%SolverCODO> o he big
[1:05:01] <+griffball13> HUGE
[1:05:02] <Ner234> monkaS
[1:05:03] <OhioNitsud> ohhh he big boy now
[1:05:08] <SleepyMaribo> almost every boss has like endless mob spams
[1:05:10] <xeros720> ahaha, well, i guess they let you change weapon easily enough
[1:05:10] <Smart_ZaK1> Yooo that fire is doing work
[1:05:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay yeah, that's a bit better
[1:05:14] <GoDZooKii> Try doing this while shells rain down. I had to solo him like that.
[1:05:17] <+jjhoho> don't get hit by his three piece
[1:05:30] <+jjhoho> oof almost got it
[1:05:34] <%InugamiTheHound> we got evil balls and tangela pokemon attakcking pat now LOL

[1:05:59] <+Grayhammatter> Yeyeyeyeye
[1:05:59] <+BurkeBigsby> @AngriestPat Backstep has I-frames. More effective than dodging back and shooting for a quick counter attack.
[1:06:00] <Smart_ZaK1> YOOOO
[1:06:00] <BakerBrute> GG
[1:06:00] <%dekkitout> Mangler? More like Mangled
[1:06:01] <Ion_Laser> YEET
[1:06:01] <$drfaustisdead> nice work.
[1:06:01] <+RinPeda> @AngriestPat About to start my first ever playthrough of ff7. Wish me luck
[1:06:03] <+moranprime> RIP Sonic
[1:06:03] <+jjhoho> fuckthat guy wooooo
[1:06:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yeyeyeyeye
[1:06:04] <xeros720> FIRST TRY
[1:06:05] <%arcaderabbit48> Good job, Fire Mod!
[1:06:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Children MANGLED
[1:06:06] <%Piemen99> YEYEYEYYEYEYEYEYE
[1:06:07] <garbageheaphound> NICE
[1:06:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE
[1:06:08] <derekwst3> prey slaughtered
[1:06:08] <%furiousfurioso> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:06:10] <borous> best mod
[1:06:10] <%demegodz> YEYEYEYE
[1:06:11] <black_mages_matter_> @AngriestPat that fight used to be way worse. it had random explosions that killed you and you couldnt see them
[1:06:15] <%greenhathero> PogChamp
[1:06:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FIRST TRY
[1:06:17] <%MonsieurHedge> the mod from this guy is funny, but ineffective
[1:06:18] <curechan9> HSWP
[1:06:19] <%starotter70> Nice
[1:06:20] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> audible sweating
[1:06:21] <%arcaderabbit48> I love that your character is so cocky
[1:06:24] <GoDZooKii> Now do the hard version
[1:06:28] <MavMarsh> the random explosions are still in the game it's just a random modifier
[1:06:29] <%InugamiTheHound> xcalDab apatDab
[1:06:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @black_mages_matter_ That's the Enchanter modifier
[1:06:34] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> now you get the small angery hairball summon mod
[1:06:34] <Zombrocom> @black_mages_matter_ the variant you get is random
[1:06:37] <CaptainFrankincense> @black_mages_matter_ that can still happen
[1:06:42] <borous> @MonsieurHedge depends on what you fight, they can help a lot with any swam bosses
[1:06:43] <SleepyMaribo> on nightmare difficulty this is like a 30 minute fight...
[1:06:45] <derekwst3> you are so SMALL STRONG
[1:06:47] <%joylent_blue> RinPeda hey enjoy, thats something a lot of ppl wish they could do again
[1:06:47] <%Calek> @MonsieurHedge I used it to beat Singe
[1:06:48] <+Jimboq> Remnant: Rolling From the Adds
[1:06:49] <black_mages_matter_> I GOT THAT 3 TIMES IN A ROW
[1:06:51] <SydSavage> Lmao that went way smoother than streams I saw of enchanter version
[1:06:57] <black_mages_matter_> I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST HIS FIGHT
[1:06:57] <Doomed2Die> i had a rengerator affix on a normally regenning boss once
[1:07:00] <Doomed2Die> it was tough
[1:07:04] <ConneD> the best mod is the agro mod that he has on the rifle
[1:07:10] <%angelmorphic> angelmorphic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hope you're doing well Mr Shortpants. Also do you think this game pulls off the DS like? I thought it failed misserably. Still good though
[1:07:14] <%InugamiTheHound> is paige still arguing with elmo???
[1:07:15] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> what is the gameplay loops like?
[1:07:16] <CaptainFrankincense> its cool
[1:07:19] <GoDZooKii> Fuzzy minions
[1:07:22] <turqrazor> I listened to the podcast where pat talked about the current state of rainbow six siege, funniest shit i've ever heard
[1:07:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, good things, like Chrono Cross
[1:07:26] <+griffball13> short cut time
[1:07:27] <+Jimboq> Detroit
[1:07:27] <%Toast_Master_General> Paige has WcDonalds
[1:07:28] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> no dont
[1:07:30] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> shortcut
[1:07:36] <ConneD> there is a bonfire close man
[1:07:44] <%Broand> So this is darkschlooters then?
[1:07:56] <+RinPeda> @joylent_blue I've only played 1 - 6 and 14. Lets see if 7 can take the throne from 6 for me.
[1:08:08] <+sixcubit> everything looks like a Nuclear Throne enemy
[1:08:18] <%ColonelRozum> pat are you ok?
[1:08:19] <%starotter70> Well Done
[1:08:22] <%angelmorphic> Black we go TriHard
[1:08:24] <Jontman42> black we go
[1:08:25] <garbageheaphound> Pat are you ok?
[1:08:27] <%arcaderabbit48> @Broand Actually no more or less loot than Dark Souls. There's upgrade materials and stuff, but like. The Shotgun is THE Shotgun
[1:08:28] <+cosinity> So are the main areas and bosses fixed, and then the subareas are random?
[1:08:32] <+zjmcmahon> This reminds me a lot of Darksiders 3
[1:08:38] <%Broand> oh I see
[1:08:43] <metaphase72> Pat is this game worth it now?
[1:08:44] <%Calek> everything is procedurally generated
[1:08:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @zjmcmahon same devs
[1:08:49] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat This game makes me think of Darksiders with RE4 and Dark Souls mixed in
[1:08:51] <%beetbo2> apatBlep
[1:09:02] <tanarath> Broand, more like Bloodborne 2 but inversed
[1:09:05] <pistofficer> is there an easy way to go back and farm bosses you previously beaten? will you get different mods from them?
[1:09:19] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat do u put this over any of the souls games so far? or is it to soon?
[1:09:26] <%Calek> you can reroll the campaign and that'll reset everything kind of like NG+
[1:09:32] <Doomed2Die> oh that mod scales super well
[1:09:32] <%arcaderabbit48> SUMMON PET
[1:09:33] <MavMarsh> you've just gotta reroll campaign and hope you get the specific boss
[1:09:36] <GoDZooKii> Funny I get Souls, L4D, and Diablo vibes.
[1:09:36] <MavMarsh> kind of annoying
[1:09:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pistofficer Join public multiplayer repeatedly
[1:09:39] <black_mages_matter_> i like seed caller if you stack it with mod generation
[1:09:45] <transporterthesequel> Pat getting dat necro build
[1:09:45] <ScreamLord> Mauser! PogChamp
[1:09:47] <%Broand> summon build confirmed
[1:10:06] <%arcaderabbit48> I am positively throbbing at the idea of a summon build
[1:10:09] <+demon_shadowplays> hey pat how come you and woolie dont do lps together? Keep the souls series going!!
[1:10:19] <pistofficer> @GeneralSCPatton ok. does thagt mean theres not a way to do it quickly on solo?
[1:10:26] <+demon_shadowplays> Souls like games I mean
[1:10:28] <Jontman42> Is this literally just Dark Souls with guns?
[1:10:29] <%voidthieff> voidthieff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Remember that scene in robocop when that guy explodes
[1:10:35] <%ComboDogeX> yo
[1:10:42] <Ericgi231> @arcaderabbit48 I'm rocking a turret summon build, it's broken. I summon so many turrets that the bosses get cages in by them and can no longer move.
[1:10:44] <Doomed2Die> summon build is viable
[1:10:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pistofficer Not yet
[1:10:50] <McAngrimStein> help I can't stop playing FF14 mahjong
[1:10:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @Ericgi231 Sploosh
[1:10:55] <%Louie_Salmon> @demon_shadowplays Woolie's unoptimal play is poison to the pat
[1:11:00] <GoDZooKii> If you wanna do MP switch your SP to public. Then pick join public. Weird, but works.
[1:11:13] <black_mages_matter_> if you upgrade a weapon to +5 and +10 and +15 asap enemies drop better materials sooner @AngriestPat
[1:11:17] <MavMarsh> you can beat the game in ~2 hours once you've got some experience at least and just ignore mobs
[1:11:27] <Smart_ZaK1> rooty tooty point and shooty
[1:11:28] <+demon_shadowplays> @Louie_Salmon But makes for great content.
[1:11:40] <OhioNitsud> when do you get a rootkit? Kappa
[1:11:41] <Coystick> Evil tree roots are a solid aesthetic
[1:11:47] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat will you be playing Astral chain tomorrow?
[1:11:47] <ivansonic08> @Louie_Salmon And PAt's over-optimized is slightly off putting for woolie
[1:11:59] <+allups> im loving it
[1:12:00] <+oOZtkOo> you havent seen nothing yet, it gets cooler
[1:12:06] <%sileo_patronus> @black_mages_matter_ @AngriestPat it's actually based on your gear average
[1:12:08] <+BurkeBigsby> Higher your gear is upgraded, the higher the level the enemies are upon world generation.
[1:12:10] <%starotter70> Pat loves killing trees
[1:12:13] <ConneD> i like the flame mod better on the rpg. gives the weapon +25% damage + fire damage and dot the enemy with burning effect
[1:12:18] <%Calek> Control is out tomorrow though and that's what matters
[1:12:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I wish Astral Chain wasn't a switch exclusive
[1:12:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Calvanized Iron? Fe believes in God??
[1:12:27] <SleepyMaribo> i thought it came out tomorrow
[1:12:34] <SleepyMaribo> wait its the 26th?
[1:12:37] <%Louie_Salmon> @demon_shadowplays It does, but there won't be a next souls game, unless you count Elden Ring, so it's kind of a moot point
[1:12:41] <Wafflercraft> is this game fun?
[1:12:43] <jeffishype> Control looks fun
[1:12:48] <%sileo_patronus> will you be playing alt and delete?
[1:12:50] <SleepyMaribo> what the hell i slept for 2 days, i lost 2 days holy shit
[1:12:57] <SomersaultJustice> no ff7? ohhh nooooooo
[1:13:09] <DSD24> I wish Nintendo would release games on Tuesdays instead of Fridays
[1:13:12] <%d00msdaydan> the wildly fluctuating 60's, what a time to be alive
[1:13:12] <%Louie_Salmon> Locked 30 works, I have a shitty PC and play this game at a locked 30
[1:13:12] <Caidezes> I need a new Alan Wake game. Control will have to do, I guess.
[1:13:13] <Valdorick> Nice aim, tree demon bro
[1:13:14] <+demon_shadowplays> @Louie_Salmon I meant to say souls like games actually lol
[1:13:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat Material drops depend more on a weighted average of gear level. You'll need a lot of +5s before you consistently get Forged Iron.
[1:13:18] <xeros720> treemen got tree guns
[1:13:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I just don't have a Switch or the money for one lol.
[1:13:22] <Coystick> What about FF8 Remaster?
[1:13:27] <star_feline> Oh shit we are now in the section with tree guns
[1:13:30] <%Nina96> does no one read the schedule?
[1:13:31] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Summon your MINION
[1:13:31] <ConneD> @Wafflercraft one of the best and polished games that i have played
[1:13:31] <$i_am_therydon> what about blasphemous when it comes out?
[1:13:35] <BRBN310> just got here, how long has he been streamin?
[1:13:40] <%Archphronimos> I swear to god I've always thought trees in winter look terrifying. They're bio-building things. They're all little "Alien"-style hives.
[1:13:40] <Punisher7771> sup pat
[1:13:45] <NeroInfinite> There's a bit of micro shit storm around astral chain on twitter becuase degenrates hate cop protags
[1:13:45] <Doomed2Die> these mobs hurt so much on nightmare
[1:13:47] <+BurkeBigsby> Didn;t know it ran at 30. Sounds like a skipperoo.
[1:13:48] <ape_hawk> shit, am i really gonna get a switch just for a platinum games game...?
[1:13:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> Pat, why aren't you streaming WoW login queues like everybody else? It's free money
[1:13:51] <%Lion_kun> Is this harder or easier than enter the gungeon
[1:13:52] <Caidezes> @Nina96 You expect people to read?
[1:13:55] <%joylent_blue> nobody has time to READ, what do we look like, a chat room?
[1:13:57] <Smart_ZaK1> It's cool that the enemies can damage eachother on accident
[1:13:58] <SleepyMaribo> also it is confirmed you can poet the doggo in astral chain
[1:13:59] <%PanicSwytch> !uptime
[1:13:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 14m.
[1:14:00] <CatmanIX> so this is like, post-apocolyptic sci-fi souls?
[1:14:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did they remaster FF7 too? I would think that the latter would make more money
[1:14:01] <SleepyMaribo> *pet
[1:14:05] <Coystick> Blasphemous is Sep 10 I think
[1:14:08] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat the shooting feels shockingly good in this game.
[1:14:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @NeroInfinite That's super stupid.
[1:14:14] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @neroinfinite that‚Äôs so dumb mischaCop
[1:14:19] <xeros720> shoot your new mod
[1:14:21] <+Jordan_z123> 700k viewers for Wow login queue Kappa
[1:14:27] <GoDZooKii> Mats drop based off gear average Pat. Not once you reach cap on one.
[1:14:30] <%Nina96> @Caidezes i expect them to scroll down
[1:14:34] <SleepyMaribo> oh wow it stun locks
[1:14:34] <%Lion_kun> Pat, Yakuza 5 or FF7 Remake?
[1:14:34] <xeros720> hehe, it's a little dude of your own
[1:14:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, TREE BABY
[1:14:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> summons yeyeye
[1:14:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Hahaha, it's a REAL Pat helping him out.
[1:14:38] <NeroInfinite> It really is.
[1:14:41] <Smart_ZaK1> Fucked
[1:14:41] <Ner234> Look at him go PogChamp
[1:14:42] <xeros720> pat spawned a pat
[1:14:46] <+allups> dont forget shoulder swapping
[1:14:48] <%SergeantSov> God where did you get that mod
[1:14:53] <Caidezes> @Nina96 You expect too much.
[1:14:56] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat so what's the story about? do you know?
[1:14:59] <Doomed2Die> husks
[1:15:00] <%SergeantSov> I've seen several people with it and I'm salty I ain't got it
[1:15:02] <+BurkeBigsby> Twiggies
[1:15:02] <+oOZtkOo> these are still the root right?
[1:15:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the more I watch this the more it reminds me of destiny for some reason
[1:15:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fuzzy bois
[1:15:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sergeantsov Sanic
[1:15:08] <+OkamiDude15> jiggies
[1:15:08] <+Grayhammatter> of course they weren't, they are the ROOT
[1:15:11] <%Louie_Salmon> @demon_shadowplays Well this one is a mix of schlooter, which is Woolie poison. And Code Vein looks rife with waif and also not great. So I guess if a super good souls-like came out, and their schedules were clear, and they both wanted to do it, then yeah that'd be cool.
[1:15:15] <SomersaultJustice> you touched them and didn't get dizzy, therefore they are not fuzzies
[1:15:17] <%worldbrand> Would y'all say pat's lucky with his run or is he playing well? I'm about to hop into this game myself in a few hours
[1:15:19] <Valdorick> Touch Seedkin, get... fucked... in
[1:15:22] <%Nina96> @Caidezes perhaps
[1:15:25] <+demon_shadowplays> @Louie_Salmon Their's seems to be like a certain feel you get when you see an lp on youtube instead of just streaming it. Get a whole other vibe at least thats how it feels for me
[1:15:26] <pistofficer> i wish this game had a monster encyclopedia you could check out, something like the witchers system
[1:15:30] <NeroInfinite> schlooting
[1:15:34] <OhioNitsud> that rifle looks so satisfying
[1:15:35] <Smart_ZaK1> Are you fucking kidding me
[1:15:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @arfsm95 Idiot scientists playing with alternate universe stuff and fucking up
[1:15:41] <Taffer85> stacking +exp LuL
[1:15:41] <ConneD> they only run around and agro all the dungeon, dont like this mod at all :P, the burning mod is like 100% better damage wise
[1:15:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MOAR EXP
[1:15:48] <xeros720> streamer privilege
[1:15:51] <ovan20> who says this game is a looter shooter has never played this game LUL
[1:15:53] <+Snirtax> Is that just the hunting rifle ?
[1:15:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Remember, kids: If a tree tries to hug you in a place or in a way that makes YOU feel uncomfortable, THAT'S NO GOOD
[1:15:58] <black_mages_matter_> there is no situation where the hunting rifle is a bad choice
[1:15:58] <Jontman42> Gonna know so much old shit man
[1:16:02] <+demon_shadowplays> @Louie_Salmon would be great man
[1:16:02] <jeffishype> big wide open spooky street asestheic
[1:16:02] <Doomed2Die> the summons stun lock mobs
[1:16:06] <+arfsm95> @King_Wolf_Rigger sounds about right
[1:16:07] <+BurkeBigsby> The little guys never aggro'd last time I played.
[1:16:10] <+allups> what was the trait with the targets in the icon
[1:16:10] <Doomed2Die> and scale into pretty huge damage
[1:16:13] <Smart_ZaK1> number go up
[1:16:17] <+kstick07> waiting for classic wow que. Thank god you're on Pat!
[1:16:18] <%worldbrand> apatBig
[1:16:21] <%totesmcgoat_> I like when number go up
[1:16:22] <OhioNitsud> big red number
[1:16:28] <+arfsm95> @King_Wolf_Rigger basically what if the upsidedown won
[1:16:32] <Shadope342> 1 charge saved
[1:16:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MUH BOI
[1:16:33] <McAngrimStein> Unga bunga numba
[1:16:35] <+Grayhammatter> it means you can build it up
[1:16:35] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> it can hold more than one charge @AngriestPat
[1:16:35] <%keyworthe> you can multiple
[1:16:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> haha, ONE
[1:16:38] <+Jordan_z123> Did pat say anything about judgement exceeding sales in the west
[1:16:41] <borous> number on a mod means multiple charges can be built up
[1:16:48] <star_feline> I wish you could pet the montrosity orb
[1:16:48] <GoDZooKii> Why does everyone think this is a looter? Lol
[1:16:49] <+OkamiDude15> does pat do the big numbers? do the number go up ?
[1:16:52] <xeros720> pat showing his little pat to other men
[1:16:52] <%Mythicalbrit> wait I left pat can summon the cupcake goblins now?
[1:16:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Look at him go! what a champ
[1:17:00] <%ColonelRozum> yes
[1:17:00] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Look at weird gremlin Elmo go
[1:17:01] <%starotter70> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah, One
[1:17:04] <+Thomzzz> i remember hearing that this game would be 4 player co-op is that true?
[1:17:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this is my son
[1:17:12] <%eldritchhorrortwitchchat> 3
[1:17:12] <dmtjinni> Is this game "The New Hotness"?
[1:17:14] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat so what's the story about? do you know?
[1:17:17] <%ThatOneGameTester> 3 player iirc
[1:17:17] <%Louie_Salmon> @pilgrimsayswhat Gremlo?
[1:17:20] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Seed-mo? Like Grubmo but seed?
[1:17:20] <GoDZooKii> 3 player Coop
[1:17:23] <ovan20> @Thomzzz 3 players coop
[1:17:27] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Grelmo
[1:17:32] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat weapon mods scale to the level of the weapon it's attached to
[1:17:35] <Taffer85> weapon mods get stronger based on the level of the weapon
[1:17:36] <Shadope342> mod damage upgrades with gun rank
[1:17:38] <+NoahilDuce> you do, dark souls style
[1:17:41] <transporterthesequel> Can you coop through the story?
[1:17:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> grelmo
[1:17:46] <%ThatOneGameTester> 4 probably put things under too much strain
[1:17:46] <+OkamiDude15> shrubmo
[1:17:48] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> what @RiceeFTW said
[1:17:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Cakemo
[1:17:57] <transporterthesequel> I mean, without the game breaking ala Bloodborne?
[1:18:00] <%mastertwin2> Grelmbo
[1:18:04] <%eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Yes you can co op through story
[1:18:06] <%SergeantSov> You can coop through the entire story, yes @transporterthesequel
[1:18:15] <SleepyMaribo> i heard control is actually really good
[1:18:16] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @AngriestPat Skirt every path you can in every level
[1:18:17] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat u finish nightwave?
[1:18:18] <%sileo_patronus> exposed
[1:18:22] <MavMarsh> on ps4 coop has been crashing for me a lot
[1:18:25] <%Louie_Salmon> Clumbo Stumbo Grelmo Skellmo
[1:18:27] <+BurkeBigsby> Co-op gets you hella Scrap and XP
[1:18:29] <%pilgrimsayswhat> The co-op is real good
[1:18:32] <RiceeFTW> as long as you don't do Nightmare, solo is great
[1:18:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like the moon
[1:18:34] <+Grayhammatter> so CLEAN
[1:18:34] <%dekkitout> Sterile, like the moon's surface
[1:18:34] <+oOZtkOo> co-op is good for grinding because you get bonuses
[1:18:35] <McAngrimStein> maybe even simple and clean
[1:18:37] <%totesmcgoat_> Devitopure.gif
[1:18:37] <+allups> its ganna be a real ball-buster
[1:18:38] <borous> pure just like columbian white
[1:18:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pure like this stream?
[1:18:41] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat so what's the story about? do you know?
[1:18:45] <ConneD> the coop is realy good, nice coop system the have in this game
[1:18:46] <borous> snort it pat
[1:18:48] <%InugamiTheHound> I'm so bad on nightwave. I'm so far behind
[1:18:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sgt Grelmo, Five Stars
[1:18:53] <%dumemoto> So, is this game a rouge-like?
[1:19:02] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat dont do co-op with randoms on pc, if the host decides to cheat,it affects everyone, i had to restart my game due to the host using a cheat that gave everyone max of every item.
[1:19:07] <SummonerMagno> 3 sorties one is up, so cant be done in 1 day
[1:19:09] <GoDZooKii> Souls like
[1:19:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dumemoto There are no bats in this game
[1:19:19] <+alpharius88> this week is there is a wf patch with the new frame
[1:19:21] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @dumemoto souls like
[1:19:21] <RiceeFTW> @arfsm95 yeah so you're this guy, and there's not much backstory on this guy, but apparently this guy has a destiny to save the world PogChamp
[1:19:24] <%sshen> Hoping they remove that hydrolyst challenges
[1:19:24] <%pilgrimsayswhat> MULTIPLE GRELMO
[1:19:32] <+NoahilDuce> yea some mods have charges
[1:19:36] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat heads up about co-op you'll load into their random seed world and can get whatever loot they haven't picked up including weapons and armor.
[1:19:36] <Zombrocom> 3 more weeks
[1:19:39] <Zombrocom> I think
[1:19:42] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Nah there's two more cutscenes still
[1:19:44] <%dumemoto> @GarbageQueenEllie I see what you did there
[1:19:47] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> gauss come out soon Pog
[1:19:49] <+NoahilDuce> and use them at once
[1:19:50] <%ArchimerDreatect> it's not the last one, you can just hit rank 30 by this time if you'r eup to date
[1:19:55] <%arancet> what? store multiple elmos?
[1:19:56] <Doomed2Die> there is an amulet that increases summon time and with enough +mod charge you can summon TONS
[1:19:58] <WanderingSwordsman> goes free to play on oct 1 right.
[1:20:01] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I'm like rank 3 on Nightwave, Destiny 2's Solstice of Heroes took all my time
[1:20:03] <+Grayhammatter> gremlos really kick ass too
[1:20:04] <WanderingSwordsman> *right?
[1:20:06] <%joylent_blue> don't talk to pat or his Gremlos ever again
[1:20:07] <%sshen> You cant do the 3 sorties challenge in a day Pat
[1:20:11] <%vectorless_peon> its not the last nightwave week it is the first weep where people could unlock everything
[1:20:13] <Taffer85> I have a skull summon mod and I love it
[1:20:13] <%dekkitout> Hopefully when this NW's done, they resume intermission's progress
[1:20:13] <Saltmeisterr> isn't gauss the vore warframe?
[1:20:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @arfsm95 End of the world scenario. Scientists were doign dream-based research in to parallel worlds. Wires were crossed, went wrong, and tree dimension began invading ours and ruining it
[1:20:19] <%Louie_Salmon> @dumemoto Not really, just procedural campaigns. Like if Left 4 Dead had procedural generation, Diablo loot that carried over, and was 3rd person
[1:20:27] <+Grayhammatter> grendel is the meatball frame
[1:20:33] <+moranprime> That's a pretty good window vault animation
[1:20:39] <%Calek> it's not really diablo loot either, you're not gonna find 50 variations of the same weapon
[1:20:40] <Coystick> Big Mallet
[1:20:41] <mostundesired> Hammer stronk
[1:20:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> We speed frame this week
[1:20:43] <%InugamiTheHound> Triple HHH hammer!!
[1:20:45] <madskull456> super different from my first experience for sure
[1:20:45] <+nekodelic> Sword >>>>>>> hammer
[1:20:50] <Smart_ZaK1> fuck that chair in particular
[1:20:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Grendel Elmo is a terrifyingly cute image
[1:20:55] <%Clundy> graceful
[1:20:59] <+Grayhammatter> that's it... i'm getting me mallet
[1:20:59] <Coystick> Nice coat psychics
[1:21:00] <+BurkeBigsby> Hammer that makes assplosions is good.
[1:21:02] <Zombrocom> It's dark souls loot dropped like it's diablo
[1:21:04] <Doomed2Die> netural dodge into charged attack is a unique super slam
[1:21:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> game has been polished pretty nice
[1:21:05] <%dekkitout> Fraggor Rock
[1:21:06] <RiceeFTW> Fragor Prime PogChamp
[1:21:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Yeah it does actually
[1:21:07] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> the fragor is more flat tho
[1:21:08] <OhioNitsud> meh kinda
[1:21:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> Gears of Souls
[1:21:09] <SpaceGuntank> it looks like a meat tenderizer
[1:21:11] <%Sh00s> looks like a microphone
[1:21:11] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat can u get BIG Poise in this?
[1:21:11] <Zombrocom> That IS a fragor you right
[1:21:11] <Valdorick> Fraggor Prime
[1:21:12] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat since i know nothing about Warframe, does Gauss look good?
[1:21:14] <%starotter70> Believe it
[1:21:15] <MavMarsh> if you flip out a window on the second story you just flop on the ground on your back
[1:21:15] <%Ynkubus18> The space radiator on a stick
[1:21:15] <%JGardner88> Maximus Fragor?!
[1:21:16] <$drfaustisdead> a lot of the animations are really good looking in this game.
[1:21:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fragor vandal
[1:21:17] <%Louie_Salmon> @calek Yeah I guess enemies don't actually drop the loot much, that's almost always from sidequests or bosses
[1:21:17] <%pilgrimsayswhat> POUND THE MEAT
[1:21:18] <%bevyrage> it's a 2 cycle engine on a stick
[1:21:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is this Fraggor Londo?!?!
[1:21:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Those are just Harley Davidson engine heads on a stick.
[1:21:26] <Paperware> Looks a lot like the super sledge from fallout
[1:21:26] <%joylent_blue> he lacks the necessary belief stat
[1:21:31] <Saltmeisterr> BEAT THE TREE MEAT
[1:21:31] <meermadon> I'm kinda surprised no one has tried to copy the warframe model yet
[1:21:33] <+Cyoctane> Looks like a motorcycle engine
[1:21:33] <%PanicSwytch> Hammer makes Pat feel big and strong like paige
[1:21:35] <xeros720> now do the C combo
[1:21:39] <%ThatOneGameTester> @GarbageQueenEllie that was good
[1:21:41] <+Caped_Eggy> Faith stat too low
[1:21:46] <PkSilent01> thoughts on Gauss the new Warframe Pat
[1:21:47] <RiceeFTW> it looks a lot like a big hammer PogChamp
[1:21:48] <Doomed2Die> hopefully you get the worldbreaker hammer
[1:21:53] <%worldbrand> ______ on a stick is usually a pretty good hammer aesthetic
[1:22:01] <%worldbrand> i still like the gyrm greathammer
[1:22:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> @ThatOneGameTester Why, thank you. I do my best
[1:22:14] <ChloroShepard> i-ron butterfly
[1:22:15] <%joylent_blue> every time he says eye-ron a part of me dies inside
[1:22:17] <%totesmcgoat_> But did you Hall Wug?
[1:22:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Grendel Frame looks fucking weird. ***
[1:22:22] <RiceeFTW> @worldbrand ah yes, I too like to use my hotdog on a stick as a hammer
[1:22:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Eye Eye Ron
[1:22:32] <+Grayhammatter> you might be capped go gremlos
[1:22:35] <%sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat you scraped that last dungeon right? I missed some of it
[1:22:38] <OhioNitsud> you just killed the barista pat
[1:22:38] <%PaladinDupre> unmute: gunfire 'asshole'
[1:22:43] <Taffer85> I find all the boss weapons are weaker than the damn basic sniper,and I don't want to dump the resources into upgrading them to see if they get comparable
[1:22:47] <%worldbrand> a man of culture i see
[1:22:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @worldbrand Not wrong. I just think it's funny that they distinctly look like the cylinder heads from a Harley.
[1:22:49] <%Boscuito> love a good serkit
[1:22:54] <%Louie_Salmon> There's probably too many seeds for that to be a thing
[1:22:54] <$i_am_therydon> sekrats
[1:22:57] <1matheuw> gauss has a helmet named mag, mag has a helmet named gauss
[1:22:58] <RiceeFTW> @Taffer85 sounds like you haven't gotten the Ruin Rifle
[1:23:01] <%Calek> my only complaint about the game really is it's hard to tell where and how far enemies are when you currently can't see them
[1:23:01] <MavMarsh> there aren't that many seeds
[1:23:02] <1matheuw> the fucking iception
[1:23:03] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> yeah that mod caps at 2
[1:23:06] <%joylent_blue> 2 gremlo
[1:23:20] <%dekkitout> Gauss x Mag, I'd ship it SeemsGood
[1:23:24] <RiceeFTW> @MavMarsh it's procedurally generated, there's TONS of seeds
[1:23:24] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I never got the boss that gives that mod in my seed ;-;
[1:23:26] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat did u do the event quest in ff14 today?
[1:23:28] <Saltmeisterr> not the be confused with gremblo
[1:23:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gremlo, he scremlo
[1:23:30] <Taffer85> Ruin is nice but it goes through ammo so quick
[1:23:33] <GoDZooKii> The boss shotgun pistol is top notch
[1:23:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now Pat has infinate adds of his own
[1:23:38] <1matheuw> looks like DE is shipping them as well
[1:23:38] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat missed an item in the last biulding, the one with the secret
[1:23:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TWO BOIS
[1:23:44] <1matheuw> uptime!
[1:23:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> We both know the true ship is Gauss and Volt
[1:23:52] <MavMarsh> i mean i've been running this game a lot and i can usually tell what's what from the first building i look at
[1:23:52] <star_feline> TWO OF THEM
[1:23:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> They hungry
[1:24:00] <+Grayhammatter> they goin'
[1:24:02] <rosemon5001> spawns of pat
[1:24:07] <MavMarsh> areas don't change much
[1:24:07] <Saltmeisterr> oh wait he actually has gremlins?
[1:24:16] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> lilttle pat babies
[1:24:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Saltmeisterr new mod he picked up
[1:24:19] <+GenesisKnight> Send in the pats
[1:24:19] <%joylent_blue> no, he has gremlos
[1:24:20] <Saltmeisterr> when did pat get that?
[1:24:21] <%st4rrytea> !uptime
[1:24:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:24] <Goldenwolf98> I feel like I have finally found out the problem with all souls like games and that is that they have a severe lack of fashion souls
[1:24:26] <%arcaderabbit48> Wow, those little bastards do not give a fuck
[1:24:28] <%Boscuito> good crowd control goes a long way
[1:24:30] <GoDZooKii> Areas do change
[1:24:31] <%sileo_patronus> nice
[1:24:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I kind of wish the magnum had longer rounds. Like the BFR in .45-70
[1:24:32] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> I mean they killed like 3 guys
[1:24:32] <$i_am_therydon> also enemy finding
[1:24:32] <%dalmek> like a normal NPC summon in a Souls Game, eh
[1:24:34] <Zombrocom> This game is kinda just chalice dungeons done well, huh
[1:24:35] <+moranprime> It also looks like the home in on enemies off camera too.
[1:24:35] <%Clundy> they do take a lot of agro
[1:24:38] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat don't tell Paige but you can summon skull familiars too.
[1:24:38] <%UW_Duncan> Just like The Darkness 2
[1:24:41] <+krawtch> is this the spiritual successor (as in BROWWWN) to Resistance 3
[1:24:43] <%totesmcgoat_> This game just look like every game from 2008. Brown.
[1:24:54] <+krawtch> @totesmcgoat_ hahah
[1:24:55] <black_mages_matter_> there's also a flying skull summon mod
[1:24:55] <1matheuw> this game looks pretty red to me
[1:24:58] <+butch_deadlift> is this like let it die with guns?
[1:25:00] <%InugamiTheHound> @UW_Duncan I love the darkness 2
[1:25:04] <%pilgrimsayswhat> The later areas are so fucking good
[1:25:11] <Make_me_mad> This game gets way more interesting as you go.
[1:25:14] <1matheuw> loving this treepocalypse so far
[1:25:16] <Saltmeisterr> red is just a shade of brown
[1:25:19] <%Calek> I just did the first part of the third area and holy cow was that a fight
[1:25:20] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This game's aesthetic is primo
[1:25:22] <Valdorick> Yeeeeeeah! More XP!
[1:25:24] <meermadon> let it die was let it die with guns
[1:25:27] <%ColonelRozum> very smart pat lol
[1:25:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[1:25:28] <MisterAngryEyes112> The fact that there's so much to do now speaks to the amount of content there is to do later!
[1:25:28] <%InugamiTheHound> F
[1:25:28] <+cosinity> Trying not to spoil too much, it doesn't stay brown forever
[1:25:29] <+krawtch> damage numbers! not using cover! BROWWWN!
[1:25:29] <Smart_ZaK1> WHY
[1:25:30] <black_mages_matter_> why did you run towards them then run away
[1:25:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> YOU DIED
[1:25:30] <jeffishype> Let It die was

[1:25:36] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> your almost too the next zone too
[1:25:36] <+allups> couldve sniped from the car
[1:25:39] <%ColonelRozum> BIG SMART
[1:25:42] <%worldbrand> I was about to say it was surprising that he lived that long just walking out in the open
[1:25:47] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @totesmcgoat_ It's got a lot colour in certain areas, the main thing is saturation is good, but it goes for a grim look in a lot of places.
[1:25:47] <meermadon> that makes me think, who the fuck is still playing let it die
[1:25:47] <Taffer85> playing this game with a controller sucks so hard, I don't see how pat can do it
[1:25:49] <xeros720> it's so frustrating to die with full estus
[1:25:50] <RupanSen> gameplay seems fun, level design looks pretty shitty tho
[1:25:56] <star_feline> Is it just me or whenver the character gets kicked out the crystal it reminds me of Super Mario 64
[1:25:57] <jeffishype> rippy zippy
[1:25:58] <+krawtch> all this waist high cover, but its more like waste high cover.
[1:26:07] <majin_romney> Yo pat, why are you not playing classic wow?
[1:26:09] <+Grayhammatter> not a smart move to be out of cover
[1:26:10] <Zombrocom> I kinda like the drab but splashed with vibrant red aesthetic
[1:26:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wheres Peach and her giant sword
[1:26:24] <%Gray_skies1993> guess my original sub message was too long lol, finally got it to work (after deleting it xD )
[1:26:25] <1matheuw> specialy that subway level
[1:26:28] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat is it just me or does the lack of death penalty make the runs back less frustrating?
[1:26:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> god I love the 60's cars so much
[1:26:31] <+allups> yeah use cover while u have it
[1:26:43] <+Grayhammatter> big number
[1:26:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> This is not the content I ordered
[1:26:46] <star_feline> SNIPED
[1:26:49] <Zombrocom> BITCH is the new Excuse Me
[1:26:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> Put also, did he change classes
[1:26:59] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat can you do stealth in this game?
[1:27:17] <%angelmorphic> The lack of penallty is one of the worst decisions in my opinion. there is zero tension
[1:27:18] <Taffer85> there's light stealth
[1:27:19] <%PaladinDupre> SMG seems a bit OP
[1:27:21] <+allups> i wish thy had a punishment for death but thyll also need to balance more
[1:27:23] <GoDZooKii> Stealth is 100% viable
[1:27:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Pookiedaexzile No, you can just buy all the class stuff shortly after you start the game.
[1:27:26] <dmtjinni> Aiming like mofo WOW
[1:27:27] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat by the time yakuza 5 comes out on ps4 i will most likely have 0-6 on ps4 thanks for getting me hooked on a series MercyWing1 sipsipHellmo MercyWing2
[1:27:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> The runbacks are grinding and progress at the same time
[1:27:35] <+oOZtkOo> kinda, but if you shoot everyone hears you
[1:27:36] <+allups> sneak attack bonus is a tihng
[1:27:36] <%worldbrand> he found an accessory that boosted stealth crits but i havent seen him find many unaware enemies
[1:27:37] <Saltmeisterr> has pat found the bug waifu yet?
[1:27:39] <Zombrocom> Can you backstab?
[1:27:40] <%PaladinDupre> Silencers
[1:27:43] <%SergeantSov> The answer is really "Yes but actually No"
[1:27:44] <%InugamiTheHound> crouch walking like that reminds me of the last of us
[1:27:48] <42nfl19> Is this a shlooter @AngriestPat
[1:27:51] <Tucker0603> @saltmeisterr go on...
[1:27:52] <%sileo_patronus> You can certainly get the drop on guys
[1:27:53] <+Pookiedaexzile> @King_Wolf_Rigger So they lied about this being a class based shooter
[1:27:53] <+krawtch> does this game have more than one stealth takedown animation? or is it just like Last of Us
[1:27:59] <Taffer85> farm those lumenites
[1:28:07] <%joylent_blue> just because it has shooting and loot, does not make it a shlooter
[1:28:07] <1matheuw> nice
[1:28:10] <dmtjinni> is this considered souls-like?
[1:28:12] <ovan20> @krawtch this game have none LUL
[1:28:12] <Saltmeisterr> shy showed a bug waifu in here video
[1:28:12] <black_mages_matter_> @arfsm95 there's a ring that gives you a 100% crit chance on unaware enemies so they intend for you to try stealth if you want
[1:28:15] <star_feline> @42nfl19 No, it's more like Dark Souls
[1:28:19] <Taffer85> loot is very rare, so not a shlooter
[1:28:20] <%totesmcgoat_> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'm sure it does but aesthetically at this moment, I've seen this game before. Grim was done to death a decade ago
[1:28:24] <Doomed2Die> whew it's over
[1:28:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Pookiedaexzile Kinda. The starting classes matter less than they do in Dark Souls.
[1:28:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @krawtch I haven't seen a takedown. I think it's just back attacks doing extra
[1:28:30] <Smart_ZaK1> Is it though?
[1:28:33] <%angelmorphic> @AngriestPat i felt the lack of a loss upon death annihilated all tension
[1:28:39] <+Grayhammatter> the magic pixel
[1:28:43] <1matheuw> i mean hes alway getting ammo and resources
[1:28:45] <%SergeantSov> Loot is rare and as such makes it very special and gratifying when you find something
[1:28:50] <Coystick> That is a nice window animation
[1:28:50] <1matheuw> so kinda shlooters
[1:28:58] <%worldbrand> Oh wow you werent kidding, that window vault animation is really nice
[1:29:01] <ovan20> maybe loot is rare because this game isn't a looter LUL
[1:29:06] <+allups> I once had the smoke guys in an apartment building. it was super annoying cuz they can go through the floor
[1:29:08] <%SergeantSov> Not that the infinite high that something like borderlands provides is bad
[1:29:09] <+moranprime> @Coystick I'd break all the bones in my hip doing that LUL Kappa
[1:29:09] <@SSaryn> Yeah, like it a lot better in pretty much this game alone./
[1:29:12] <Taffer85> death is only annoying when you die near the end of a long dungeon
[1:29:15] <MavMarsh> there's an entirely different one for going through a glass window
[1:29:18] <star_feline> Did pat play Big Boy Mode?
[1:29:20] <MavMarsh> they're all good
[1:29:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT WILL PLAY WOW CLASSIC
[1:29:22] <SulfurousAcid> Hello, how is shotbang souls?
[1:29:25] <black_mages_matter_> @angelmorphic its less tense but its a fun looty shooty romp with good bosses
[1:29:26] <rufus2k2> god that shadow jumped me
[1:29:32] <GoDZooKii> it's NOT a looter ppl.
[1:29:36] <derekwst3> that enemy looks like a cat
[1:29:43] <1matheuw> also this red tree city looks somewhat similar to the darksiders 3 one
[1:29:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT LIED
[1:29:44] <Shadope342> oh he's one of THOSE people
[1:29:46] <@SSaryn> Why don't you wanna wait 4 hours to play WoW classic? Kappa
[1:29:46] <reiju_22> thank god LUL
[1:29:47] <rufus2k2> I remember unloading a clip on a mirror reflection in Deus Ex1
[1:29:48] <%UW_Duncan> Kill those 'puhlettes'
[1:29:48] <+curtisbennettjr> W OMEGALUL W
[1:29:49] <%Sh00s> wow classic is trash
[1:29:49] <%PaladinDupre> SMG OP
[1:29:53] <%sporeian94> Would you ever play FFXIV Classic?
[1:29:54] <+moranprime> I give WoW Classic 3 months
[1:29:57] <%dalmek> Hey Pat you seen that new game coming out called Control?
[1:29:58] <%SergeantSov> lmao, meme classic
[1:30:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> WoW is an evil game.
[1:30:00] <1matheuw> except less colorfull and more grim
[1:30:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @totesmcgoat_ I feel you. I think I got lucky and stopped playing "BROWN" pretty quickly so it's not done to death for me, so I can enjoy the colour that is in this game. But yeah, if you're burned out on it, prob gonna be awhile before this game changes your mind.
[1:30:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wow is trash
[1:30:02] <%angelmorphic> @black_mages_matter_ I like the game. I just feel it completely fails to pull of a DS like in every way. it's just a shooter with a DS skin.
[1:30:04] <%arcaderabbit48> It is kinda funny and kinda surreal how tightly genre conventions have a hold on people. "Has guns = grind for betters guns" when its made routinely clear that that is not the case is interesting
[1:30:05] <%dalmek> made by the dudes what did Alan Wake etc.
[1:30:08] <%PanicSwytch> Is there a story/plot, or is it just shootsouls?
[1:30:09] <Zombrocom> @dalmek He's playing it tomorrow
[1:30:10] <@SSaryn> You get a better one, dw.
[1:30:12] <@lewdskeletor13> @dalmek He‚Äôs playing it this week!
[1:30:12] <+DireTroy> I don't know why people want you to do WOW classic when every person and their mom is playing it
[1:30:14] <+krawtch> why would you 1) play wow classic and 2) play wow classic on day 1
[1:30:15] <+allups> top tier gun for sure
[1:30:15] <%dekkitout> Wouldn't a FF14 classic be an absolute mess
[1:30:19] <1matheuw> is that a microphonehamer?
[1:30:19] <%dalmek> oh neat thanks for the heads up
[1:30:29] <%Sh00s> wow is such a boring game to watch anyways
[1:30:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dalmek No thse are the darksiders crew alan wake is another group
[1:30:30] <+Cyoctane> So whats the structure of this game? Is this a story campaign?
[1:30:35] <black_mages_matter_> @angelmorphic i think it's less of a DS game and more like what Warframe initially tried to be before it said "fuck it" and went full space ninjas
[1:30:37] <meermadon> I would totally play FF14 classic since I missed like four years of content
[1:30:40] <TheCrook92> Nightmare, as Yoshi P put it
[1:30:40] <%RubberFistFight> @DesuDesuDokiDoki yeah it is. And I say that as someone who played from Wrath all the way up until a few months into BfA - when the trash level became too high to ignore.
[1:30:41] <%totesmcgoat_> Not ARR, woof
[1:30:41] <Taffer85> FF14 original release LuL
[1:30:41] <rufus2k2> NIGHTMARE
[1:30:41] <OToole42> I came here for Pat, and to get away from WoW classic
[1:30:42] <+HajimenoStream> N I G H T M A R E
[1:30:43] <star_feline> How was FF14 was?
[1:30:43] <+bobdobbz> I started Hunter. Should I restart and do mid range?
[1:30:43] <%worldbrand> That would be an absolute mess that I would love to see
[1:30:46] <%arcaderabbit48> @dekkitout I would be cool with playing that for like a week just to experience pre-ARR but wow would I not stick around
[1:30:47] <%Dementedpenguin> @PanicSwytch there's a plot. Pat spent a lot of the first stream reading computer notes
[1:30:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> as yoshi p put it "NIGHTMARE"
[1:30:49] <%SergeantSov> FFXIV Classic: Just get killed by Bahamut again jesus christ
[1:30:49] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> wow classic is already an absolute mess people just have nostalgia
[1:30:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> It'd be ff11 :^)
[1:30:52] <1matheuw> chest pat
[1:30:53] <BlueLunecy> Give us FF11 classic instead
[1:30:54] <+Grayhammatter> N i g h t m a r e
[1:30:56] <ivansonic08> "Man FF14 got bad after A Realm Reborn"
[1:30:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> So the next Xpac is going to be A Realm Reset.
[1:30:59] <1matheuw> behind the stair
[1:31:02] <+alpharius88> warframe classic
[1:31:02] <+cosinity> @bobdobbz Your starting class means basically nothing
[1:31:02] <%Nina96> i would play ff14 classic cause i want to know
[1:31:03] <%sporeian94> What could possible be wrong with FF14 Classic?
[1:31:07] <+SakakiNatsuma> I'd genuinely be interested in a sidequest line that let you replay the XIV 1.0 storyline in the current game with current mechanics ect
[1:31:09] <%sileo_patronus> FF14 Classic: A Real Unbirthed
[1:31:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Which takes you back to FFXIV 1.0
[1:31:14] <%angelmorphic> @black_mages_matter_ the problem is it is a very on the nose attempt at a DS like. and it fails. so if your game tries to carry itself that way. that's how i'm going to judge it
[1:31:14] <%PanicSwytch> @dementedpenguin Thanks
[1:31:19] <1matheuw> i would like warframe to be slower tho
[1:31:22] <+bobdobbz> @cosinity thanks, was hoping to hear that
[1:31:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @bobdobbz Nope, you can get all the class stuff very earl on in the game, starting class matters very little.
[1:31:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat I was watching people Stream it earlier today. Everyone is fighting over Kobold kills for quest collections. Apparently there were players spotted doing an FF14 style line system on mob kills.
[1:31:35] <+krawtch> Me: I bet you can't get a bunch of morons to buy a game they already own. Blizzard: Hold our Diablo Immortal.
[1:31:35] <+Grayhammatter> use your eyeballs
[1:31:39] <meermadon> for real tho, FFXI classic, do it square
[1:31:41] <1matheuw> it would make a whole slew of weapons viable
[1:31:43] <MavMarsh> that sounds terrible
[1:31:43] <+bobdobbz> @king_wolf_rigger thanks.;)
[1:31:49] <%Nope80808> PAT LOOK WITH YOUR SPECIAL BALLS
[1:31:51] <RiceeFTW> @bobdobbz starting class only changes the starting stats (traits) and weapons. the other class weapons you can buy anyway, and you'll get all traits eventually so there's 0 consequence for changing classes later
[1:31:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> It would be cool if a future expansion has to go back to the abondoned relm to try to reclaim it
[1:31:53] <%SergeantSov> They cant fail you if you dont use them tho
[1:31:56] <@SSaryn> Become eyeballs
[1:31:59] <McAngrimStein> @krawtch You know people aren't buying a copy of WoW classic, right?
[1:32:04] <%totesmcgoat_> Be blind like Paige
[1:32:05] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @bobdobbz No prob bud
[1:32:07] <$PaleBloodInk> You've gotten this far without them, so why start now?
[1:32:08] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:32:08] <Smart_ZaK1> Hmmmm
[1:32:08] <%InugamiTheHound> is pat becoming big blind like Paige
[1:32:09] <1matheuw> eyes on the inside*?
[1:32:10] <rufus2k2> when in doubt, blame paige
[1:32:10] <star_feline> Infectious blindness LUL
[1:32:11] <%skizzuto> yeah but she's big and strong unlike you
[1:32:13] <%Nina96> what eyeballs?
[1:32:14] <ovan20> Paige doesn't use her balls? rooD
[1:32:15] <%PanicSwytch> Do u have to go to the eye doctor?
[1:32:18] <%connos_procrastination> just hear and then see
[1:32:18] <%VantomPayne> WHOS TALKING
[1:32:21] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> BIG boss time

[1:32:24] <Ion_Laser> WHO SAID THAT
[1:32:24] <curechan9> LUL
[1:32:25] <@lewdskeletor13> Did she schedule her eye appointment?
[1:32:26] <%SergeantSov> YEAHHHHH
[1:32:27] <%totesmcgoat_> Ignorantly optically challenged
[1:32:27] <Valdorick> Is Paige's Blindness spreading? Like a sickness of some king?
[1:32:27] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> time to share those dark secrets
[1:32:27] <+moranprime> sipsipGasm : "Hey!" Kappa

[1:32:30] <Ner234> Yeah talk mad shit about Paige. We won't tell her later LUL
[1:32:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Paige may have the biggest balls of all, but they blind as fuck
[1:32:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aggressive honking. Like a goose.
[1:32:32] <%SergeantSov> ITS THE BOI
[1:32:33] <MavMarsh> alternate kill on this one
[1:32:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> BOSS ARENA

[1:32:43] <star_feline> CLIP IT
[1:32:43] <%sporeian94> I wonder who will die first, Paige or Elmo
[1:32:45] <RiceeFTW> when you have to turn down the radio cuz you can't see while driving LUL
[1:32:45] <derekwst3> you are going to lose against this boss
[1:32:45] <pistofficer> the hype!
[1:32:45] <shurtal> Hey @AngriestPat In P4G, time doesn't advance when you're in a dungeon right? It only advances when you leave?
[1:32:46] <Smart_ZaK1> GET ready

[1:32:50] <+zaworldo> the legs
[1:32:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> shoot good
[1:32:52] <CrypticMochi> Paige can hear the smell
[1:32:52] <1matheuw> what a pecke-
[1:32:53] <+Cyoctane> I envy future humans who evolve to have zoom vision
[1:32:53] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @AngriestPat if you kill the trees legs you gett a hammer
[1:32:54] <+Draylle> just kill it 4Head
[1:32:54] <rufus2k2> shoot it until it dies
[1:32:56] <%Big_Dream> shoot it in the face
[1:32:57] <%SergeantSov> There is but shut up and figure it out tho
[1:32:58] <%worldbrand> HAZE PASSAGE
[1:32:58] <+CounterBeard> Is this truly the darksouls with guns?
[1:32:58] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> if you dont you get a gun
[1:32:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHOOT HER
[1:33:00] <%dekkitout> Is it 'dig up stupid?'
[1:33:00] <+MazDoThing> Do Thing
[1:33:00] <%Nina96> Shoot it till it dies
[1:33:00] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat you can chop his legs for 1 weapon or you can kill him normally for a different one
[1:33:01] <%Skittlesoul> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:33:01] <+StewTheGreat> if you kill him normal you get a gun, if you kill the legs you get a hammer
[1:33:02] <curechan9> peck
[1:33:02] <+oleron_666> shoot it
[1:33:02] <+krawtch> @McAngrimStein it still takes a subscription. which you buy.
[1:33:02] <+zaworldo> legs for hammer, no legs for shotgun
[1:33:03] <xeros720> time for the next BABABABABATTLE
[1:33:03] <+allups> aim for the head for a gun or legs for hammer
[1:33:04] <@SSaryn> Not gonna lie, don't know what it is.
[1:33:05] <%residentfunko> JUST SHOOT IT
[1:33:06] <Smart_ZaK1> If it bleeds, you can kill it
[1:33:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bullets are effective
[1:33:08] <+OkamiDude15> shoot the cyber demon till it dies
[1:33:08] <thegreenbenis> DON'T BE SCRUB
[1:33:08] <+king_of_beggars> If you say Paige's name too many times it summons her short attention span like the Candyman.
[1:33:09] <1matheuw> shotgun
[1:33:11] <CrypticMochi> Shoot it harder
[1:33:12] <RiceeFTW> yes
[1:33:13] <Doomed2Die> only one
[1:33:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> That stink fog looks like a boss room.
[1:33:14] <xeros720> tip: don't die
[1:33:14] <RiceeFTW> either or
[1:33:14] <+allups> yes either or
[1:33:14] <%sporeian94> Use the gun to shoot the cyberdemon to death!
[1:33:14] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> yes
[1:33:14] <%VantomPayne> or
[1:33:15] <MavMarsh> either or
[1:33:16] <+Skwizgarr> either or, not both
[1:33:17] <+StewTheGreat> yes either or
[1:33:17] <ovan20> @AngriestPat ONLY 1 ITEM
[1:33:18] <star_feline> Use all your consumables
[1:33:18] <cosmicdischarge> shotgun
[1:33:19] <Paperware> break only one leg and you get both
[1:33:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> DAB ON IT
[1:33:20] <RiceeFTW> only 1 this run
[1:33:21] <black_mages_matter_> @AngriestPat shotgun has a DOT grenade launcher. dont know shit about the hammer
[1:33:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You have to re-rool to get both
[1:33:21] <%residentfunko> shoot it with the gun and bam win
[1:33:22] <+allups> no both
[1:33:23] <%SergeantSov> Yep, you'd have to either reroll or join a different game to get the other one
[1:33:23] <McAngrimStein> @krawtch Sure, but no one is 'rebuying' the same game
[1:33:26] <SulfurousAcid> shotgun tho
[1:33:29] <SGrim> @AngriestPat shotgun's better
[1:33:32] <mastermidget23> So a question for any other frequent players of this game. I'm finding the beam rifle to be hands down the best weapon in the game. Is there ANY advantage to the regular assault rifle, as its direct comparison? Aside from, I would assume, some of the Rhom enemies being resistant to the radiation beam?
[1:33:34] <%VantomPayne> get shotgun cuz you wont use the hamemr anyway
[1:33:35] <derekwst3> prove them wrong and do both
[1:33:36] <+TheSaintJohn> bust them kneecaps son

[1:37:00] <mastermidget23> Sorry to bug you guys with round 2 of the same question, but IS there a reason to use the regular assault rifle over the beam rifle? Seems like the beam is just straight up better, aside from maybe rad resistant enemies?
[1:37:00] <+bobdobbz> Chop the neck
[1:37:01] <%InugamiTheHound> so kill him like a titan from AOT
[1:37:05] <%SOAMalachi> @AngriestPat If you break his legs before you kill him you can get a boss hammer off this guy.

[1:43:14] <RiceeFTW> the mod on this is actually insane
[1:43:16] <star_feline> Hmm slow reload tho
[1:43:18] <SulfurousAcid> only one round though

[1:43:24] <xeros720> oh, one shot? don't know about that
[1:43:24] <+CounterBeard> This game looks fun but how bad are the ads for bosses? That treethulu didn't seem THAT bad. But I've heard it gets p. bad.
[1:43:25] <$drfaustisdead> gross bio tree guns are the best guns.
[1:43:26] <1matheuw> all aboard the flak cannon hype train muthafuckas
[1:43:27] <+bobdobbz> Buckshot
[1:43:30] <Smart_ZaK1> Can you upgrade mag capacity at some point?
[1:43:31] <SpaceGuntank> does it have to make gross noises?
[1:43:34] <MavMarsh> you can just roll after every shot anyway
[1:43:35] <RiceeFTW> it does big damage
[1:43:35] <%ColonelRozum> @arcaderabbit48 every gun with a modis
[1:43:36] <+Grayhammatter> good thing you got quick hands
[1:43:36] <+jjhoho> there are various ways to upgrade reload tho

[1:43:38] <Khorneflakes_> Yes, it kills things good
[1:43:40] <RiceeFTW> and rot damage is very good
[1:43:41] <pistofficer> ihope future weapons will look a little more uniqe. alot of junk+tree look
[1:43:43] <SGrim> @SulfurousAcid there's armor later in the game that makes that a HUGE benefit.
[1:43:46] <BakerBrute> SMG for nerds and big gun for big oys
[1:43:48] <xeros720> at least reload speed should be better
[1:43:51] <+allups> yeah and the hammer was just a slightly better version of the one u have a heavy Hitters mod
[1:43:54] <%arcaderabbit48> @ColonelRozum Yeah, but I havent heard any of the others squish liek that
[1:43:55] <+bobdobbz> The shotgun coughs after every shot

[2:11:55] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> use the mod you cowardf
[2:11:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Just a beast skull they wear as armour
[2:12:00] <%PaladinDupre> There's a full size machine gun called The Chicago Typerwriter

[2:12:09] <Smart_ZaK1> Eclipse!
[2:12:09] <%dalmek> @valriot tomorrow, as it turns out
[2:12:10] <TrollKing96> These dudes kinda remind me of Zeno Clash.
[2:12:11] <+jjhoho> it's just a tommy gun
[2:12:17] <+Rexton_Armos> 404 sun not found
[2:12:20] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @AngriestPat Look at the Not-A-Darksign in the sky
[2:12:20] <+oOZtkOo> this place sucks!
[2:12:21] <%Bt_Robot> Het, look it's the ending to DS3 over there.
[2:12:29] <%InugamiTheHound> this reminds me of the pit DLC from fallout 3
[2:12:33] <1matheuw> @PaladinDupre escuse me what
[2:12:33] <%cylish> This part just sold me on the game
[2:12:34] <GoDZooKii> You only get typewriter from the Lizs though
[2:12:38] <Make_me_mad> My favorite thing about this game is that the slide has crazy I-frames on it.
[2:12:44] <%weissguard> <Kiln of the First Flame>
[2:12:46] <%king_wragles> Why are you playing Rage @AngriestPat ?
[2:12:47] <studleydoorite> zeno clash was colorfuler and weirder
[2:12:49] <%PaladinDupre> @1matheuw found it on the wiki
[2:12:52] <+Rexton_Armos> I like how tight the roll is
[2:13:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> MAd Max meets Berserk?
[2:13:01] <%sl8r4l8r> DOME OF THUNDER
[2:13:08] <$TheYharnamTheorem> This seems like a game I will enjoy when it becomes free with Playstation Plus in the not too distant future.
[2:13:12] <Ion_Laser> TWO MEN ENTER
[2:13:12] <Khorneflakes_> I guess I had the salvage trait nearly max, maybe that's why I got a lot of salvage from pottery cohhHmm
[2:13:15] <%Roasted_Pheasant> RAGE? MORE LIKE PAIGE
[2:13:21] <%Roasted_Pheasant> OOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:13:23] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat why are you fighting in Iraq LOL
[2:13:23] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat how is the pacing? You haven't felt under-leveled going to new areas right? You can just push forward and don't have to grind?
[2:13:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatDab
[2:13:24] <star_feline> Mad Max sand post apocalypse is somehow underrated
[2:13:31] <Smart_ZaK1> Damn roasted
[2:13:31] <+paladinstarbuster> smells like progress
[2:13:33] <OToole42> @Rexton_Armos yeah, especially how pat i-framed the god darn explosion on the spear
[2:13:34] <studleydoorite> the crisp graphical style is very zeno clash
[2:13:43] <+Grayhammatter> dun gon prolly
[2:13:43] <VERDAXY> Looks like a better game then technomancer
[2:13:43] <%worldbrand> one of these leads to temeria
[2:13:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @42nfl19 pacing is real good all the way through
[2:13:44] <+astralelephant> @42nfl19 the game scales based off your gear level.
[2:13:51] <IntrepidEye> one of several dungeons in this zone
[2:13:51] <Zombrocom> NEAT
[2:13:52] <Shadope342> @AngriestPat side area
[2:13:57] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kigom ?

[2:14:04] <%starotter70> Done Jon?
[2:14:06] <@SSaryn> Cause this weird shit
[2:14:06] <%Dementedpenguin> This place is reminding more and more of the original Stargate movie >_>
[2:14:08] <%worldbrand> I like this
[2:14:08] <garbageheaphound> CONCOURSE OF THE SUN
[2:14:09] <+GenesisKnight> Different areas have different styles of dungeon I guess?
[2:14:09] <%Nope80808> When did you switch to Destiny 2?
[2:14:10] <Smart_ZaK1> Black goop?
[2:14:12] <SulfurousAcid> Don Jon
[2:14:13] <+Grayhammatter> gooey
[2:14:13] <+Rexton_Armos> @42nfl19 the game will + the areas even if you try to min max the scaling mechanic
[2:14:16] <%miguelrod777> mass effect shit
[2:14:16] <$Brother_Coduss> Scifi metro system
[2:14:17] <SleepyMaribo> its time for the bullshit
[2:14:17] <%juxtest> Is this Destiny
[2:14:18] <GoDZooKii> Machine gun arms inbound
[2:14:19] <+GenesisKnight> Yoooo

[2:14:20] <RupanSen> robits
[2:14:20] <%dalmek> that's a good name
[2:14:22] <Tisaric> this game turning into Destiny was the last thing I expected
[2:14:22] <Zombrocom> So it turns out this game has a variety of aesthetics
[2:14:22] <ape_hawk> that dude was just walking!
[2:14:25] <Crankthulhu> Y'know, FromSoft could make a killing in lawsuits if they ever tried to copyright the bonfire teleport mechanic LUL
[2:14:25] <simulationbard> Concourse of the Sun is a good ass name
[2:14:26] <%pilgrimsayswhat> HR Geiger ass dudes
[2:14:27] <%Calek> I really appreciate the vastly different areas in this game

[2:14:33] <+griffball13> RADS

[2:14:39] <+bubblebasspickles> got it
[2:14:40] <Panquake25> I saw Distortion spend over an hour in this one room
[2:14:42] <star_feline> Pop a RAD X
[2:14:42] <+jjhoho> radiation is a fun mechanic
[2:14:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> this shit cool
[2:14:44] <+jjhoho> i like it
[2:14:46] <+griffball13> get some rad x quick
[2:14:49] <SpaceGuntank> this looks like something straight out of Warframe
[2:14:52] <VERDAXY> we in FALLOUT now boys
[2:14:52] <%InugamiTheHound> use rad x and radaway
[2:14:52] <BakerBrute> 20 STORIES TALL MADE OF RADIATION

[2:15:00] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, this place is nuts
[2:15:00] <ape_hawk> are we a destiny now?
[2:15:00] <Taffer85> i spent so long on the boss of this place that just seeing these vyr sentries again is triggering me
[2:15:02] <%wolfofsound> is this a shlooter now?!
[2:15:02] <GoDZooKii> Rad lowers stamina
[2:15:02] <+allups> notice how this thing also have a zombie-like a problem
[2:15:03] <MrNoobMcSalt> @AngriestPat Rad halves your stamina
[2:15:05] <McAngrimStein> the way this area looks really reminds me of Immortal Unchained now
[2:15:07] <$Brother_Coduss> *Giger counter clicking intensifies*
[2:15:08] <Crankthulhu> That's rad
[2:15:10] <+oOZtkOo> heavy water for rads
[2:15:11] <+Rexton_Armos> time for [ H E A V Y W A T E R]

[2:15:16] <MavMarsh> one of the good gones
[2:15:17] <IntrepidEye> i had no idea those were breakable
[2:15:18] <SleepyMaribo> what does radiation do, i never got the status to fill all the way
[2:15:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> H R Geiger counter herr
[2:15:26] <%starotter70> People weren't kidding when they said the tone shifts a lot
[2:15:27] <%pilgrimsayswhat> chest
[2:15:27] <%InugamiTheHound> now this podracing?
[2:15:29] <Zombrocom> Rad reduces stamina
[2:15:30] <+Skwizgarr> Radiation halves max stamina
[2:15:35] <ape_hawk> does the "heavy" in heavywater imply lead?
[2:15:35] <GoDZooKii> Cuts stamina in half
[2:15:35] <RiceeFTW> radiation halves stamina LUL
[2:15:36] <@SSaryn> Interestingly enough, there's a puzzle in the main area that does give you stuff against Rads.
[2:15:39] <+Grayhammatter> this might be podracing
[2:15:39] <%Nina96> aw shit not spicy air WutFace
[2:15:40] <%SergeantSov> Need that heavy water now boi
[2:15:44] <%Ynkubus18> Theres a little Giger but also some Beksinski influence
[2:15:46] <ape_hawk> cuz thats how you get lead poisoning
[2:15:47] <%anticrust> WHO'S Coughing?
[2:15:47] <1matheuw> WHOS COUGHING?
[2:15:48] <Taffer85> paige has root rot monkaS

[2:15:49] <+griffball13> paiges has rotten
[2:15:49] <%SergeantSov> Cause that's also something humans can just drink
[2:15:52] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Look at this xenomorph ass place
[2:15:53] <+bubblebasspickles> ghost cough
[2:15:53] <Shadope342> bless you elmo
[2:15:54] <+Grayhammatter> whos coughing?
[2:15:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ape_hawk It implies radioactive material
[2:15:56] <transporterthesequel> hmmm SPACE MEHREEEN intensifies
[2:16:06] <Make_me_mad> Get ready to fight some fuckin' Nekrons.
[2:16:11] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Who blesses a cough? That's weird as AF.
[2:16:11] <+griffball13> this is some nerco space shiot
[2:16:12] <%TheTakkster> Some of this reminds me of Soma
[2:16:17] <1matheuw> its a godam polish canon
[2:16:21] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> use the alt fire
[2:16:22] <MavMarsh> use the grenado
[2:16:23] <42nfl19> But it only has one shot you have to be very close to make sure all the pellets hit
[2:16:24] <+Rexton_Armos> listen do you want your balls to move to the palms of your hands? If not take the lead poisoning
[2:16:29] <lambretime> That's a necron...
[2:16:29] <RiceeFTW> USE YOUR MOD
[2:16:33] <%ColonelRozum> DODGE
[2:16:34] <+allups> Paige has consumption

[2:16:39] <Shadope342> boink, boink, boink.
[2:16:39] <borous> pat have you used the mod on it yet?
[2:16:42] <%ColonelRozum> HEAL
[2:16:42] <%InugamiTheHound> I get a weird necromorph vibe from them
[2:16:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ape_hawk Heavy water has deuterium instead of regular hydrogen. It's got that extra neutron.
[2:16:47] <+jjhoho> pat's gonna have consumption too if he's not careful
[2:16:51] <star_feline> I'd say it's bad for rapid firing enemies, but for slow fucks the shotty is choice
[2:16:53] <ape_hawk> ah
[2:16:54] <Smart_ZaK1> Kill him?
[2:16:57] <Kurrisum> Has pat been spending traits?
[2:16:59] <ape_hawk> thank you for clarification
[2:17:02] <%ColonelRozum> shoot him?
[2:17:03] <%hawk_rush> just got here, how's the game so far??
[2:17:04] <IntrepidEye> did they nerf those guys? I remember them three shooting me
[2:17:16] <$Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat why does this look like someone put deadspace guy in warframe?
[2:17:25] <MavMarsh> oh what you can hurt yourself with it
[2:17:26] <+Hicks1942> This is a really cool area.
[2:17:34] <+Rexton_Armos> @intrepideye that's the minor versions of them. They have stronger versions in other areas
[2:17:38] <transporterthesequel> BIO GOO
[2:17:41] <%bevyrage> it's a good thing the friendly fire on that shotgun is real small
[2:17:42] <+KoyoTheBoyo> ambiguous black goop

[2:21:44] <%tweedler92> Man this area really looks like Warframe
[2:21:45] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat any chance of Hades now that it has a fourth floor and what should be final boss?
[2:21:56] <FirearmsInstructor> How far along into the game is Pat? Anyone know? (I just got here. Not sure how much progress has been made since he finished Saturday.)
[2:21:58] <+BurkeBigsby> Does pat not know you can change shoulder?
[2:21:59] <Digimonstrosity> reload speed is totally a trait
[2:22:00] <+Rexton_Armos> with high ass reload speed it looks like you're playing a banjo when you reload
[2:22:03] <ALazo> Can you switch the shoulder you're looking over?
[2:22:04] <+grim_abel> Quick reload + Crit + Coach Gun = Best build
[2:22:08] <+griffball13> i love the fact that these future things are killed by gun
[2:22:09] <+Rexton_Armos> @firearmsinstructor second tileset
[2:22:12] <Kurrisum> Pat is through the first lvl
[2:22:12] <MavMarsh> he knows about the shoulder switch
[2:22:14] <Smart_ZaK1> Prioritizing the ranged bois seems like the way to go

[2:22:28] <%SergeantSov> It does look like a sick guitar riff when reloading the hunting rifle at high speeds
[2:22:32] <ALazo> I'm not telling him, I'm asking if it's possible, but I guess that's an answer
[2:22:34] <+allups> if u have a gremlo on hand pop it doesn't die over time
[2:22:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rexton_Armos Thanks... out of how many? Any idea what %?
[2:22:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat I'm surprised you're still stuck with regular iron. I grinded my way to the 3rd iron type on Earth.
[2:22:40] <unclerizla> whas that funky gun pat got, never seen it. grenade launcher?
[2:22:44] <+BringBackSempai> nice Halo 1 pistol

[2:23:43] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SHOOT THE BUTT
[2:23:45] <+BringBackSempai> my only real problem with getting this game is the bosses seem underwhelming

[2:24:21] <krymzen5> chest
[2:24:22] <Paperware> chest in the corner
[2:24:27] <+Rexton_Armos> @grim_abel yeah I'm close to that its gonna be hype. My cast on my coach is floating heads. I don't have crit chance or weak spot damage up tho
[2:24:29] <FirearmsInstructor> Has he encountered the Ent yet?
[2:24:36] <MavMarsh> it's good, whether it's $40 good is up for debate
[2:24:40] <GoDZooKii> Bosses underwelming? You've not seen The Ent.
[2:24:40] <+Rexton_Armos> @firearmsinstructor he got the shotgun from it
[2:24:40] <+TigglesWorth> "now this is a chest i can see"
[2:24:42] <Ion_Laser> I didn't know ammo and bullets were multiversal
[2:24:44] <tired_fan> what's happening Patster?
[2:24:56] <+griffball13> hammer them
[2:24:58] <krymzen5> yeah we arer
[2:24:59] <+BurkeBigsby> they die in 1 melee hit
[2:25:02] <Digimonstrosity> what class is pat
[2:25:10] <42nfl19> Are there "grenade" type weapons in this game?
[2:25:10] <jeffishype> chest
[2:25:11] <VERDAXY> Run LIKE A COWARD
[2:25:12] <+jjhoho> why did i just fight the moonlight butterfly
[2:25:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rexton_Armos Did he knock the leg off? I heard you can get a cool grenade launcher if you don't.
[2:25:13] <star_feline> You should've brought an SMG, ya gosh dern fool
[2:25:14] <+allups> use ur pistol mod
[2:25:17] <S4boar> what is this Katamari Damacy? Kappa
[2:25:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> MELEE
[2:25:21] <+griffball13> use the gremlins
[2:25:22] <+jjhoho> how do you look at THAT fight and go "yes this is the dark souls we must emulate"
[2:25:23] <Smart_ZaK1> Use mod
[2:25:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rexton_Armos I haven't played the game, just saw some stuff.
[2:25:26] <$Brother_Coduss> HAMMER TIME
[2:25:26] <%bevyrage> think you'll need something with more fire rate
[2:25:31] <%bevyrage> or crowd control
[2:25:32] <%Calek> this is why I use an SMG, for crowd control
[2:25:33] <+grim_abel> I use Desert Breath on my shotgun it does decent damage and allows for panic wave stunning.
[2:25:34] <%SergeantSov> Don't wanna melee the green ones, they cause RAD
[2:25:35] <RupanSen> honestly I'm not sure about that shotgun
[2:25:36] <%Bt_Robot> It's time for grobbos
[2:25:43] <Tisaric> I kind of dislike how much backpedaling I've seen that you almost have to do
[2:25:44] <Khorneflakes_> Back to the beginning LUL
[2:25:45] <+demon1103> seriously wanna know who was is charge of chest design and said, 'lets make them practically the same color as the walls"
[2:25:53] <+Rexton_Armos> @firearmsinstructor Knocking legs off=cool hammer Just killing is the shotgun Pat is using that has the grenade launcher on his mod slot
[2:25:53] <MavMarsh> not on the green dudes they explode for tons of damage
[2:25:54] <%pilgrimsayswhat> No, they're real weak to melee
[2:25:55] <star_feline> Scared by grelmo LUL
[2:25:55] <%bevyrage> what the shit was that thing
[2:25:57] <%PaladinDupre> KILL THAT MOB FFS
[2:25:59] <RiceeFTW> @jjhoho yeah, guess it's better to just sit there and block everything instead hggOkay
[2:26:00] <black_mages_matter_> it is never not time to hammer
[2:26:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Nah, it woulda killed them all no prob
[2:26:06] <tacostarvedbeast> gotta believe in urself
[2:26:06] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat they die in one melee hit
[2:26:07] <+nekodelic> You could kill them easily with the sword
[2:26:09] <jeffishype> Hammer
[2:26:12] <+Sgthor> The lil mob was his friend!
[2:26:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rexton_Armos ahhh thank you :) :D
[2:26:14] <mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat Megaman Zero/ZX collection was leaked just now

[2:26:27] <+allups> hammer has a long swing
[2:26:30] <+461dragonman461> Is this Gun Souls?
[2:26:31] <+jjhoho> @RiceeFTW what u mean
[2:26:39] <+griffball13> @461dragonman461 yes
[2:26:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you do combo with hammer swings?
[2:26:42] <%galaxyswirl> then dont melee those guys Kappa
[2:26:44] <Khorneflakes_> That's true
[2:26:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> If you can't handle some spicey air, you a bitch
[2:27:00] <$Brother_Coduss> Whats a bit of cancer when you get to beat someone to death
[2:27:01] <+Grayhammatter> do cumbo

[2:27:06] <RazHarvey> MEGAMAN ZX COLLETION HYPE!!
[2:27:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> do stumbo
[2:27:11] <RiceeFTW> @jjhoho most of the Souls games you'll just sit there and block for that fight, whereas here you actually have to maneuver and think about your resource usage
[2:27:13] <+grim_abel> Hammer is trash melee
[2:27:18] <+461dragonman461> Glad to finally catch a stream live
[2:27:20] <tacostarvedbeast> this a loot shooter? feels like one
[2:27:23] <+allups> i hope thy update the melee combat and add invasions

[2:28:08] <+BringBackSempai> lol hammerhead
[2:28:09] <Paperware> looks like a moa from warframe
[2:28:10] <MavMarsh> the butterfly clone in this one is actually good though
[2:28:12] <+BringBackSempai> great design
[2:28:13] <MavMarsh> cause you have guns

[2:28:37] <42nfl19> Will this be a long term game or one you keep for yourself? @AngriestPat
[2:28:41] <Taffer85> this is why I only bother with chests
[2:28:43] <star_feline> Might get this game on sale it looks pretty tight

[2:28:49] <+nekodelic> sword is still better :| :|
[2:28:50] <BlindGato> Tried Co-op yet?
[2:28:53] <+Rexton_Armos> tbh when I first loaded this game I played it for 13 hours straight and I still love going back into it
[2:28:56] <%PaladinDupre> a game with guns but no 1911, 0/10
[2:28:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> jim sterling was wrong again?
[2:28:58] <RiceeFTW> co-op is pretty great too
[2:28:58] <%Verd_254> How's it feel? It looks a little sluggish but can never really tell just watching.
[2:28:59] <tacostarvedbeast> if only pats honk was a real life stand he could use on himself
[2:28:59] <%Bt_Robot> So far you've gone in a straight line.

[2:29:02] <ovan20> how can you get lost with a minimap? LUL
[2:29:02] <krymzen5> plz yes

[2:29:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat wtf is "Control"? I keep hearing it, but have no idea what it is.
[2:29:34] <IntrepidEye> its only $40. Its really worth it for that price

[2:29:40] <FalseEyeD> Drop them all for Wow Classic. Kappa
[2:29:42] <Cherokia666> Jim's wrong about a lot of stuff
[2:29:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Care to elaborate?
[2:29:44] <SleepyMaribo> Jim's impression of the game was due to him getting a bad roll on his world @AngriestPat
[2:29:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> Jim Stirling? Wrong? NO WAY!

[2:30:23] <+Cyoctane> Jim gave Bloodborne a perfect score, so he's not always wrong
[2:30:23] <Smart_ZaK1> The absolute juice of it
[2:30:37] <+Generalfroggy> hey chat I just got in here. How is Pat liking this?
[2:30:45] <%RubberFistFight> So there's someone having a public freakout on the street right outside my house, the cops are here, but theyre basically just standing around scratching their heads while the person screams about god knows what like they're dying.
[2:30:45] <RogerPoore> Jim liked zelda musou more than any zelda game, he has his preferences
[2:30:51] <star_feline> @Generalfroggy He said game good
[2:30:52] <GoDZooKii> Bloodbornes not perfect
[2:30:53] <+allups> Jim usually has good opinions doesn't mean I always agree with em

[2:32:01] <+Grayhammatter> go gremlos go!
[2:32:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah! go little guys!
[2:32:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I love when enemies conga-line, so if you miss one (or they dodge) you hit the guy behind your intended target. ;) Collateral FTW
[2:32:06] <ovan20> shooting your wn minions LUL
[2:32:07] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Wait fuckin what you can have little minions?
[2:32:10] <ALazo> Shot the little guys every time
[2:32:11] <SleepyMaribo> Pat has 2 mind goblins!
[2:32:14] <+Rexton_Armos> Oh shit he has Pillow Goblins
[2:32:14] <+allups> thy love jumping in ur bullets
[2:32:17] <%Verd_254> pat has learned to use the mind gobos
[2:32:18] <EatMyVordts> guns ARE magic
[2:32:19] <tacostarvedbeast> all the warriors
[2:32:20] <Fear_Ranjer> Magic pew-pew machines
[2:32:24] <+Rezca> We were sick of watching Classic WoW streams
[2:32:26] <Khorneflakes_> @FirearmsInstructor to be specific the devs for this game worked on Darksiders III and 2's definitive addition... especially the case looking at these enemy designs
[2:32:27] <jeffishype> gremlos
[2:32:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SMG might be better for this area
[2:32:39] <SulfurousAcid> call it a dot
[2:32:41] <jeffishype> please use those boys
[2:32:42] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Lots of little swarming dudes
[2:32:44] <+grim_abel> Poison gas grenade and gremlin summoning.
[2:32:46] <%InugamiTheHound> how big is this area?
[2:32:46] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh this is a THQ game?
[2:32:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat stop shooting your own doggos! D:
[2:32:51] <redial_nick> finally weaponizing them i see
[2:32:55] <wisconsinbear> @wisconsinbear is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:32:57] <StaticEntry> That one mob looked like he was on vacation from the Darkest Dungeon.
[2:32:57] <+allups> SMG with fire rounds is kinda op
[2:33:01] <%king_wragles> D.O.T.? Why not just say dot?
[2:33:07] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @allups that's what I did c:
[2:33:07] <ovan20> @InugamiTheHound smaller than you think, Pat is just lost LUL
[2:33:08] <+Rexton_Armos> Yes, Weaponize the children
[2:33:08] <+grim_abel> Unless it's a boss weapon you can switch the mod out for different ones. His shotgun is a boss weapon
[2:33:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> just got done with d&d, figured id pop in
[2:33:14] <%sjay449> as someone who never played wow, I don't understand why people were so hyped for Classic. Why are they excited to replay a MMO from 2004?
[2:33:15] <Khorneflakes_> @Fear_Ranjer Nah
[2:33:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @Khorneflakes_ For Control or this game?
[2:33:16] <star_feline> OOO nice dodge
[2:33:17] <MavMarsh> not thq, it's perfect world
[2:33:21] <MavMarsh> whoever that is
[2:33:28] <RazHarvey> capcom is killing it this year
[2:33:29] <%bevyrage> oh no he has the high ground!
[2:33:30] <ballsack2020> Hear ye hear ye

[2:33:49] <+Cyoctane> capital f
[2:33:51] <GoDZooKii> Perfect World made...Perfect World.
[2:33:52] <nademonkey1100> what is this alien bullshit
[2:33:52] <Taffer85> now do it again :)
[2:33:52] <Smart_ZaK1> I would swap out revolver for SMG
[2:33:54] <%smitty_werb_> That really looked like TWD font lol
[2:33:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You need the rifle or smg
[2:34:01] <GoDZooKii> Free MMO
[2:34:02] <implied_consent> LOL
[2:34:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Heals is good
[2:34:04] <nademonkey1100> i just got here
[2:34:04] <S4boar> is that a bonfire?
[2:34:08] <+jjhoho> ya map is useless on multilevel floors tbh
[2:34:09] <%PaladinDupre> SMG OP
[2:34:11] <%DeathsDoom> DeathsDoom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[2:34:14] <%worldbrand> it's a bonrock
[2:34:17] <%pilgrimsayswhat> The SMG is stupid good
[2:34:18] <%PaladinDupre> The Revolver is a skill weapon
[2:34:27] <+jjhoho> it's not a bonfire *wink*
[2:34:35] <RazHarvey> remember to melee those ball things, mr patterson Keepo
[2:34:35] <Fear_Ranjer> JUICY SHOT
[2:34:52] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It's the non explodey ones that hate melee, yeah
[2:34:53] <wisconsinbear> This is an interesting game
[2:35:00] <RealThiele> is this the worlds of warcrating
[2:35:01] <%PaladinDupre> Pat i know you like the spore gun but its making you bad
[2:35:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> At least you won't lose your souls
[2:35:11] <%DeathsDoom> So what exactly type of game is this?
[2:35:14] <VERDAXY> Not a good trade
[2:35:18] <%sjay449> like I watched some of the big streamers play WOW, and they were literally just doing fetch quests and kill X amount of enemies abusing their spawns to make it go faster
[2:35:18] <+jjhoho> regular ass shotgun fucked those skinny guys up
[2:35:20] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SMG doing work apatBig
[2:35:20] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow
[2:35:23] <GoDZooKii> Souls like
[2:35:28] <RazHarvey> its dork souls with gun..and better story
[2:35:30] <+Rexton_Armos> Coachgun is the true shotgub
[2:35:33] <+Cyoctane> Anyone know if this is a GaaS type game?
[2:35:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are they being summoned by something??? Seems like a shit ton of enemies bumrushing you
[2:35:36] <ALazo> Enemy density is quite high
[2:35:42] <Smart_ZaK1> Damn this dungeon is not going easy on you
[2:35:53] <+Rexton_Armos> They come out of the walls
[2:36:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Huh, I wonder why automatic weapons took over the world as the way to fight
[2:36:01] <MavMarsh> devs have said they intend on putting out dlc and stuff
[2:36:01] <+Rexton_Armos> the runny Bois
[2:36:02] <+grim_abel> Yeah this game will throw WAVES at you
[2:36:04] <+BringBackSempai> yeah this game likes enemy waves
[2:36:06] <IntrepidEye> they spawn whenever an elite spawns
[2:36:10] <+Sgthor> I think I just got here today also. Yeah this one style of dungeon is really heavy on enemies
[2:36:13] <GoDZooKii> I breezed this
[2:36:13] <+Rezca> They come out of the walls
[2:36:16] <Kurrisum> Sometimes
[2:36:18] <RazHarvey> not a fan of that flash bang at bonefire though
[2:36:18] <+grim_abel> Yes
[2:36:19] <@SSaryn> Some, yes.
[2:36:19] <%sjay449> I watched Funahaus's video for this game, and it seems like it's probably more fun in coop
[2:36:22] <+Rexton_Armos> ye look for the diamond windows
[2:36:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is that spawn-goop!? D:
[2:36:25] <nademonkey1100> GAME OVER MAN
[2:36:33] <%sjay449> wow, fuck that guy I guess
[2:36:38] <%Odetokale> the Vyr dungeons are really aggressive on the enemy waves.
[2:36:48] <tanarath> Pat, you have two more trait points to spend
[2:36:50] <IntrepidEye> they come out of the rectangular holes
[2:36:53] <BrachyZoid> 19 raiders from BrachyZoid have joined! 
[2:37:01] <+grim_abel> Weapons have preferred ranges. Shotguns do more damage the closer you are. @AngriestPat
[2:37:02] <Kurrisum> A flurry of like 6 small mobs usually means a big one is somewhere nearby
[2:37:03] <Artista_AF> brachy1Brabuns brachy1Brabuns brachy1Brabuns brachy1Linkgood
[2:37:09] <RealThiele> giant enemy crab
[2:37:09] <+pth88> is this like a dark souls inspired shooter
[2:37:12] <S4boar> are "backstabs" a thing in this game?
[2:37:17] <RiceeFTW> elite mobs tend to spawn some adds
[2:37:17] <+Rexton_Armos> sadly no
[2:37:18] <+Sgthor> I think your DNA also hates that radiation sh*t Pat
[2:37:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> As much I like the M79 shotty being in this game, I'd probably not use it here.
[2:37:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Might not come out of the walls, but seems like a RE7 "Molded" type spawn in area / mechanic.
[2:37:33] <%sjay449> @AngriestPat you going to check out Shadowkeep?
[2:37:35] <Smart_ZaK1> He even sounds a bit like Isaac
[2:37:38] <+Grayhammatter> oh shit
[2:37:39] <Artista_AF> is this the Gun Souls?
[2:37:46] <+grim_abel> GAME OVER MAN GAME OVER
[2:37:46] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[2:37:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Literally coming out of the woodwork
[2:37:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat oh wow it *IS* spawn goop D:
[2:37:49] <+Rezca> I do my best just to rush this map type
[2:37:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Seems more of a mini-boss destroyer.
[2:37:54] <SpaceGuntank> "they're coming out of the goddamn walls!"
[2:37:55] <%miguelrod777> THIS IS WHAT VICTORY MEANS
[2:37:56] <+Grayhammatter> like a necromorph
[2:37:59] <$Jmann1892> THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE WALLS MAN
[2:38:01] <S4boar> thanks ranxton
[2:38:01] <+Armeggadon> There is a trinket you can get that makes it so the first attack on unaware enemies is a guaranteed crit. That's about as close to backstab as it gets
[2:38:03] <%InugamiTheHound> god I miss dead space so much. Fuck yeah for killing dead space!!
[2:38:10] <star_feline> Pat have you ever even once run out of ammo?
[2:38:15] <%ItsRatman> Minor spoilers: I have discovered a dog in this game and you can pet it. 10/10 game
[2:38:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Armeggadon He has it
[2:38:24] <+oOZtkOo> we BEAT the root tho
[2:38:29] <%Solidnick18> man
[2:38:31] <+Rezca> wait what? He hasn't run out of ammo?
[2:38:36] <%Ne1son> Mess with the necrohole you get the necropole
[2:38:36] <black_mages_matter_> you can run out of ammo in coop
[2:38:38] <tanarath> Pat, two more trait points.
[2:38:38] <%GarbageNirvana> And this is normal difficulty right
[2:38:43] <%Odetokale> if the keybindings are the same for your controller, the clicking the left stick while aiming will change shoulders.
[2:38:46] <RiceeFTW> very easy to run out of ammo in hard mode too
[2:38:47] <+Rexton_Armos> you can also get ammo boxes which help in co-op
[2:38:47] <+GaiaGreen> i beat a shadowbringers MSQ last night that gave me Big Sad
[2:38:48] <+StewTheGreat> You can change the shoulder you aim over by clicking the left stick while aiming btw
[2:38:49] <+grim_abel> Running out of ammo usually happens on co-op and bosses
[2:38:53] <+jjhoho> @AngriestPat I think i found out why that person said it's important; co-op. item pickups are shared in co op EXCEPT ammo
[2:38:55] <+Rezca> ah
[2:38:56] <+A123yourdead> Like fortnite
[2:39:02] <Khorneflakes_> Some weapons go through ammo SOOO quickly. The shotgun and SMG are pretty economical
[2:39:03] <%sjay449> I feel like your character needs more quips, or should have been silent
[2:39:05] <+Rexton_Armos> yeah that's when you use your consumables
[2:39:07] <GoDZooKii> Ammo is scarce in MP oddly enough
[2:39:21] <+jjhoho> magnum chews through it
[2:39:21] <+Rezca> aim for its bootie
[2:39:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Death funnel, noice
[2:39:22] <ObsidianDragon86> can I say that I REALLY Appreciate how much you're Guns Stun and Flinch the enemy even mid lungew?
[2:39:23] <WalkingErection01> Acutally ammo pickups are shared but only for sidearms
[2:39:24] <RealThiele> so its gauntlet rules
[2:39:25] <%ruemika> ruemika subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:39:29] <Xazrael666> How far is Pat into the game?
[2:39:30] <+jjhoho> it's not scarce, same droprate, just not shared as far as i know
[2:39:36] <%sl8r4l8r> GOTTEM
[2:39:37] <+StewTheGreat> I started running out of ammo regularly in the next major area
[2:39:40] <%InugamiTheHound> walking turret monster?
[2:39:40] <+Rexton_Armos> I usually keep 10 ammo boxes on my person at all times
[2:39:46] <WalkingErection01> main weapons are for only the person who picks them up
[2:39:48] <+Sgthor> cirNilla nice shot
[2:39:51] <+grim_abel> Drops don't get multiplied for co-op. So ammo drops are still single player rate
[2:39:53] <HeroSolaire> So, how good is this game?
[2:39:56] <GoDZooKii> Ammo is NOT shared
[2:39:59] <mayorrev> this feels like Warframe but slower
[2:40:00] <42nfl19> so was the first world earth and now we are mars or something?
[2:40:02] <+grim_abel> They just get shared, cept ammo
[2:40:06] <+Rezca> I really wish ammo was shared...
[2:40:09] <MavMarsh> isekai
[2:40:09] <%GarbageNirvana> @HeroSolaire We're all digging it
[2:40:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Need to be more environmentally aware. You keep rolling into walls and obstacles. This time was a wall, before you died from that fountain-thing. :|
[2:40:18] <+jjhoho> yeah they need to adjust it imo it's bad design
[2:40:19] <HeroSolaire> It looks pretty great
[2:40:19] <lambretime> Is this a necron tomb world?
[2:40:24] <Zedimonx5> What are these creatures made of?
[2:40:25] <lambretime> This feels like one.
[2:40:26] <%GarbageNirvana> ...well, most of us are
[2:40:27] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @grim_abel I think it's an alternate universe Earth
[2:40:27] <HeroSolaire> I need to finish downloading ut
[2:40:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[2:40:30] <RealThiele> sounds like ammo doesnt really serve a purpose but to limit coop fun
[2:40:35] <%InugamiTheHound> does this game feel good on a controller?
[2:40:35] <%bevyrage> those were real good warning shots
[2:40:37] <star_feline> The whole not shared ammo seems like a dumb design flaw
[2:40:42] <Make_me_mad> This is basically a Necron tomb world, yes.
[2:40:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Not giving you shit, just an observation. you keep getting hit from that stuff :|
[2:40:51] <+Rexton_Armos> I prefer this game on keyboard and mouse for pc myself
[2:41:00] <MavMarsh> there's pretty intense aim assist so you can hit things with controller pretty well anyway
[2:41:03] <+Rezca> that spell is actually really good
[2:41:03] <+grim_abel> This is entirely different planet called Rhom.
[2:41:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> do think Diablo 4 will ever exist, Pat? is it even worth hoping for?
[2:41:07] <%Shonen_hero> Shonen_hero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! hey u a cool guy. Thanks for the content and the cat pats
[2:41:07] <GoDZooKii> I ran out like 3 hours ago because a teammate kept gabbing it. Ammo box is needed in MP.
[2:41:10] <%worldbrand> pat's on a gamepad and i dont think he's complained about controls yet
[2:41:11] <+jjhoho> yeah agreed seems like a bad decision
[2:41:12] <+grim_abel> Pat used star gate.
[2:41:13] <Khorneflakes_> @lambretime LUL yeah, just wait till you see a certain someone later and go... "yes, that's a tomb lord"
[2:41:24] <+jjhoho> oh he's HUGE tomb lkord
[2:41:25] <lambretime> Oh god...
[2:41:26] <%bevyrage> you think it'd be nice if you could swap out your melee for another gun?
[2:41:31] <OToole42> @star_feline yeah, though its partly balanced, whatever weapon you're using to kill enemies causes its ammo type to drop
[2:41:37] <+jjhoho> i don't mind tho, ripping other content for like 1 world is fine y'know
[2:41:40] <+jjhoho> keepin it fresh
[2:41:40] <+Rezca> I can go for 3 guns
[2:41:43] <WalkingErection01> idk man ive yet to have ammo issues in coop and i play with two others. sidearm ammo pickups get shared with each player and long gun ammo we just decide who needs it more
[2:41:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, Pat's got the rythm down pat
[2:41:49] <theangryguyofde> Statue tactics HSWP
[2:41:53] <%DeathsDoom> !uptime
[2:41:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:54] <%senorpapel> senorpapel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey pat, wanted to say good work on the closet chocolate. Also i just got into star trek for the first time, i started voyager after finishing ds9. Does voyager ever get as good as ds9? (My roommate who loves voyager informed me to lower my expectations.)
[2:41:56] <+AngriestAngryArtist> this be on normal?
[2:42:00] <Flarepulse> Whoa, its over
[2:42:06] <MavMarsh> take that you bastard
[2:42:10] <%logoth_> He does a power geyser to heal?
[2:42:13] <%MelBrooksKA> spyCheese spyCheese spyCheese
[2:42:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> dude that heal is basically full heal shit, it's so good
[2:42:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Not feeling the lever action anymore? Like this setup more?
[2:42:18] <%bevyrage> OH BOY
[2:42:19] <star_feline> PogChamp
[2:42:20] <+AngriestAngryArtist> PURPLE!
[2:42:23] <+Grayhammatter> physically oh yeahs?
[2:42:23] <SulfurousAcid> PURP
[2:42:25] <GoDZooKii> And no ammo is not a bad design choice. Coop would ruin any challenge if we shared ammo.
[2:42:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Gravity Bone
[2:42:28] <+arabundo> cat ring?
[2:42:28] <%Nope80808> SPYOOOHHHYEAH?
[2:42:33] <%bevyrage> YO
[2:42:34] <RupanSen> Pucci Stone
[2:42:34] <+griffball13> WEB BALL
[2:42:34] <+Rezca> Is there usually one artifact per map?
[2:42:35] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Oh that's super good!
[2:42:36] <%senorpapel> Get them sweet purps
[2:42:36] <%worldbrand> That seems alright
[2:42:37] <%Typhaeon> Oh shit a Infinity Stone
[2:42:39] <Smart_ZaK1> That is pretty cool
[2:42:39] <$Brother_Coduss> Knockoff infinity stone
[2:42:40] <+OkamiDude15> power stone
[2:42:43] <star_feline> That's GOOD
[2:42:44] <+AngriestAngryArtist> because you got enemies all the goddamn the time
[2:42:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Boning in gravity
[2:42:52] <%dekkitout> Gribbity grabbity, here comes the gravity
[2:42:52] <%sl8r4l8r> DO YOU BELIEVE IN GRAVITY?
[2:42:54] <+griffball13> thanos would like to know your loacation
[2:42:58] <Smart_ZaK1> No
[2:42:58] <%arcaderabbit48> Especially with the hammer
[2:42:58] <Khorneflakes_> AND you have a shotgun, so going lose quaters is an even better thing
[2:43:03] <%InugamiTheHound> went to a sword now?
[2:43:03] <Fiend95> Is it time to give them the sequeeeeze?
[2:43:07] <Khorneflakes_> close quarters*
[2:43:10] <+grim_abel> SWORD DECENT
[2:43:12] <SulfurousAcid> get attacked serious sam style
[2:43:17] <+jjhoho> act-3 freeze o'clock
[2:43:23] <Meekest> That ring may as well just say "25% damage increase"
[2:43:43] <+Rezca> oh no
[2:43:48] <%bevyrage> aw yeah BEHOLDER
[2:43:48] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat what were you gonna say before you found the rare drop?
[2:43:50] <Khorneflakes_> cohhM bad timing
[2:43:53] <star_feline> Oh no it's the REE stone
[2:43:54] <+aivalera> Enemies will now charge at you one at a time.
[2:43:55] <HeroSolaire> Is this Diablo with guns? haHAA
[2:43:56] <Khorneflakes_> this guy
[2:43:57] <Zedimonx5> I wonder if there is a time stop....
[2:44:03] <%bevyrage> GOOD TRADE holy shit
[2:44:09] <%logoth_> fred durst to victory
[2:44:09] <+therealfernando> This area was one of the toughest for me
[2:44:22] <%InugamiTheHound> that monster sounds like the monster from dead space 2 the raptor enemy from the church.
[2:44:23] <GoDZooKii> Prefer the 25% to damage below 50%.
[2:44:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Dude you magic-pixel'd that health on that last heal.
[2:44:33] <Kain5707> is pat a god gamer at this game D:
[2:44:38] <%bevyrage> this is a solid zone
[2:44:44] <$Kaialb> is this that game about rebuilding/augmenting yourself?
[2:44:44] <%bevyrage> and yes he is
[2:44:46] <RazHarvey> nope just ginger god
[2:44:52] <+gatoralus> yeah this part is tough. but i really liked this area
[2:44:52] <+Sgthor> Would Division 2 be better if it played like this you think?
[2:44:55] <+Rexton_Armos> @godzookii that ring isn't as good for shotguns on mobs though
[2:44:58] <+Rezca> This place is basically Stargate isn't it?
[2:44:59] <%arcaderabbit48> @Kaialb I think you mioght be thinking of The Surge?
[2:45:00] <+KingOfTheGeats> I found the skulls to be more annoying than this area
[2:45:01] <McAngrimStein> Division 2 is really bland
[2:45:02] <+grim_abel> You can see how your character rates against the current area by going to your character tab and hitting "advanced stats" @AngriestPat
[2:45:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat's a good gamer, we just handicap the shit out of him.
[2:45:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> are the levels randomized?
[2:45:12] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat two more trait points
[2:45:12] <McAngrimStein> in every way, but especially visually
[2:45:18] <$Kaialb> @arcaderabbit48 you're right, kinda reminded me of that
[2:45:27] <GoDZooKii> No but it's great on my build.
[2:45:28] <+therealfernando> This area is so enemy heavy too, makes it tougher when you're getting swarmed
[2:45:29] <Khorneflakes_> Rating vs Zone, is really helpful
[2:45:35] <Khorneflakes_> I have to admit
[2:45:35] <%bevyrage> is there a purpose to just
[2:45:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @Kaialb Its apparently getting a sequel later this year, if you're interested
[2:45:41] <%bevyrage> banking on the exp gain?
[2:45:42] <%senorpapel> Pat needs to be handicapped by chat to prevent him from growing too strong. @king_wolf_rigger
[2:45:42] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat Traits max at 20 just a heads up
[2:45:51] <%Bt_Robot> It seems weird to pump EXP bonus in a game where you can grind for XP
[2:45:52] <%bevyrage> oh so there is a cap, cool
[2:45:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do those char traits max? Is there a soft / hard cap that you're aware of? 16's getting up there.
[2:45:55] <+jjhoho> ok srsly what boss weapons are GOOD
[2:45:59] <+Sgthor> Question chat is Elder Knowledge the best trait to lvl up first?
[2:46:00] <$Kaialb> @arcaderabbit48 huh, didn't know that, thanks for the heads up
[2:46:05] <$Kaialb> this game seems fun though
[2:46:14] <star_feline> it's good especially with that ring
[2:46:17] <SleepyMaribo> @Sgthor if its not bugged anymore then yes
[2:46:18] <Kurrisum> Gear upgrade are technically BS because it always scales to what you have when it generates levels
[2:46:20] <+grim_abel> I never got The Ent so I never got Sporebloom that DOT is beast.
[2:46:20] <+GraakosGraakos> Can you play this completely single player?
[2:46:24] <GoDZooKii> Alot of boss weapons are good.
[2:46:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel Too true, it's why we shit talk him all the time. Keep him down so he doesn't figure out his true power.
[2:46:28] <Smart_ZaK1> Below you?
[2:46:31] <Make_me_mad> You can solo the game, yes.
[2:46:31] <%bevyrage> downstairs?
[2:46:32] <MavMarsh> i think i read somewhere that elder knowledge pays for itself after around 70 trait points worth
[2:46:32] <%arcaderabbit48> @Bt_Robot Apparently the exp needed to level up caps out eventually, so leveling the skill to make leveling easier does have a point
[2:46:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Behind and to your right???
[2:46:35] <%bevyrage> yup there he be
[2:46:37] <+gatoralus> i honestly think almost every weapon can be viable in this game
[2:46:41] <%senorpapel> Wait doesn
[2:46:42] <+gatoralus> they are all good
[2:46:46] <VERDAXY> SUPRISE
[2:46:52] <krymzen5> i gotta grab this next month
[2:46:53] <+grim_abel> I run a starter weapon so yeah
[2:46:55] <krymzen5> looks fun
[2:46:56] <%GarbageNirvana> These enemy designs are cool
[2:47:00] <+Grayhammatter> uh... what
[2:47:00] <+Rezca> even that beginner repeater is nice
[2:47:00] <+Rexton_Armos> upgrades are needed because the game will scale itself up outside side of scaling to just you too.
[2:47:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh jesus ballsack shit noooooooo move bitch no!
[2:47:05] <+grim_abel> Every gun can work in this game
[2:47:05] <%senorpapel> Doesn‚Äôt shittalking pat increase his power? @king_wolf_rigger
[2:47:10] <+Rexton_Armos> I run Coachgun is its great
[2:47:10] <%SneakTheBeak> SneakTheBeak subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Been really hard at work lately, I love working as an EMT but there was a psych call that ended in a suicide this weekend, really got to me because of my history of depression. Thanks for being here to cheer me up Pat, love ya man.
[2:47:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> We went from fall in the last of us to stargate with vampires
[2:47:28] <+GenesisKnight> yo that's metal
[2:47:29] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a dope game
[2:47:32] <+Armeggadon> @Sgthor not if you start as the cultist class. Starting as the cultist gets the mod power generation trait which is easily the best trait in the game. You also eventually can reallocate all your stats near the end of the game
[2:47:34] <GoDZooKii> Singes, the shotgun pistol, Ents. All of em.
[2:47:36] <+grim_abel> Coachgun bois rise up
[2:47:37] <+Rexton_Armos> shoot the butt
[2:47:38] <Smart_ZaK1> I think it is the same voice actor as Isaac Clarke
[2:47:39] <RiceeFTW> i'll explain this once for the plebs: leveling the exp gain trait is the best because leveling traits does not increase enemy difficulty level and the amount of exp required to level is ALWAYS below 1500 exp
[2:47:46] <+Rexton_Armos> Real Coachgun hours
[2:47:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel hmm, but if we don't shit talk him, he'll just be better. Between a rock and a hard place.
[2:47:57] <Tersalus> I leave for an hour, and when I come back is a new genre
[2:48:05] <Dreigun> this looks great, but I don't know if my PC will run it ><
[2:48:09] <+DeaconBluesClues> @angriestpat are you going to take a look at control? it appears to be heavily influenced by the SCP foundation and the weirder parts of twin peaks
[2:48:18] <RiceeFTW> exactamundo
[2:48:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SneakTheBeak If you ever want to talk hit me up on discord. I've had a few EMT friends before and Know how rough that can be
[2:48:27] <GoDZooKii> I rock couchgun, and Singes SMG.
[2:48:30] <+Sgthor> @Armeggadon Oh gotcha that makes sense. I went with the class that has the repeater as a starter. Thanks
[2:48:31] <Artista_AF> that's actually kinda good
[2:48:34] <Khorneflakes_> PogChamp
[2:48:40] <%worldbrand> Woo
[2:48:41] <+gatoralus> sick i can't wait to play control
[2:48:47] <42nfl19> But when will you have time for the podcast!
[2:48:53] <$valriot> It's a fuckin weird game so far
[2:48:54] <42nfl19> or is there one this week?
[2:48:54] <+Grayhammatter> it must be, out guy doesn't lie
[2:48:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Has Woolie recovered from Japan yet
[2:48:59] <+Rexton_Armos> I rock Coach gun Devistator doubleshot guns
[2:49:00] <spinalwizard> Motherfucker YES, new remedy game.
[2:49:01] <FalseEyeD> At last, male streamers are allowed to play Control.
[2:49:02] <%senorpapel> @sneakthebeak sorry to hear that man, one of my friends works at a hotline and that gets really taxing. So i can imagine how rough it is for you
[2:49:07] <Djinnazz> It's pre recorded this week.
[2:49:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> They arleady recorded the podcast me thinks
[2:49:09] <%bevyrage> this legit feels like it's a prime dungeon for co-op
[2:49:09] <Smart_ZaK1> Stabbed
[2:49:10] <+nekodelic> there is nothing down there, I'm on full screen
[2:49:13] <+Grayhammatter> wow, just shanked that guy
[2:49:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @42nfl19 They did it this morning at 9am, because Woolie is still trapped in Japan
[2:49:22] <%worldbrand> Yeah i think it was mentioned that it was already recorded earlier
[2:49:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @42nfl19 He and Woolie recorded the podcast yesterday, I think it's up right now.
[2:49:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah, alright
[2:49:35] <FalseEyeD> This game really comes alive in Co-Op.
[2:49:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Didn't know he was there another week
[2:49:47] <+Double_Tap_That> So is this the Warframe of Dark Souls games?
[2:49:49] <+grim_abel> Coachgun + Defiler = Best combo yo
[2:49:59] <%ruemika> @ruemika is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:50:00] <Khorneflakes_> That it is, that mod
[2:50:09] <chronoxgp> itd be alot scarier if enemies kept respawning from everywhere
[2:50:13] <VirtuaRailith> this lookss a lot like tom clancey's warframe, the divison 2
[2:50:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @Double_Tap_That Currently, but a little while ago it was The Blair Witch of Dark Souls games
[2:50:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @SneakTheBeak Thanks for your service. I know it can be rough and, oftentimes thankless, but you do important work, and you do more good than you're given credit for. Sorry today was rough. ;(
[2:50:31] <%PaladinDupre> @grim_abel you dont know about the Chicago Typerwriter
[2:50:31] <+grim_abel> Menders Aura is SUPER useful
[2:50:32] <%SneakTheBeak> @doc_ock_rokc, @senorpapel Thanks guys, it's been a rough lately and that just added the cherry on top. I'm good though, means a lot to me that everyone here is kind enough to lend an ear.
[2:50:33] <%senorpapel> This warlock @angriestpat
[2:50:38] <GoDZooKii> Plays nothing like Div2
[2:50:38] <+Rexton_Armos> @grim_abel Yeah that's what I run I get the Defiler and Devistator mixed oof
[2:50:42] <%senorpapel> ?
[2:50:45] <%RubberFistFight> INANIMATE CARBON ROD
[2:50:49] <%SneakTheBeak> @firearmsinstructor, thanks man means a lot
[2:50:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> is this scifi or fantasy?
[2:50:50] <+oOZtkOo> blind
[2:50:53] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat quest items
[2:50:54] <+oOZtkOo> key item
[2:50:56] <+Rexton_Armos> both
[2:50:56] <chronoxgp> quest items pat
[2:50:57] <FalseEyeD> This is Tom Clancy's Dark Souls
[2:50:57] <garbageheaphound> blind'
[2:50:58] <+Rezca> I like how they handled weapons in this one, I hate schlooters where picking up equipment is a slog
[2:50:58] <$Brother_Coduss> @Order_of_Mystery yes
[2:51:00] <%Bt_Robot> Key item
[2:51:05] <%SolverCODO> can you pick your gender in this game
[2:51:11] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Huh, carbon rod. I wonder if it is radioactive.
[2:51:12] <+Rexton_Armos> yes
[2:51:20] <ALazo> This key heavy but it open shit
[2:51:21] <Khorneflakes_> @Order_of_Mystery mix of both, Darksiders sort of fantasy
[2:51:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SneakTheBeak your a stronger man then I. Keep going and keep in mind you don't have to do it alone
[2:51:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @SolverCODO Yeah
[2:51:25] <+grim_abel> My build has to use single or double shot weapons because of my slayer armor. That 35% boost is too good
[2:51:29] <%SolverCODO> neat!
[2:51:32] <%senorpapel> Shove the key into your skull!
[2:51:35] <GoDZooKii> 3 of those rods get you a full armor set
[2:51:41] <RiceeFTW> Slayer set is real good with crossbow or shotguns
[2:51:45] <+nekodelic> betrayed the sword clan
[2:51:48] <chronoxgp> red hot rod
[2:51:51] <+Rexton_Armos> I run The scrapper set right now because the Shotgun pistol has a 6 shot clip
[2:51:51] <MavMarsh> i think i can count on one hand the amount of pubs i've played with that isn't male with voice 2
[2:51:55] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you just picked up a carbon rod in a place more radioactive than chernobyl. hope you like hand cancer
[2:51:55] <MavMarsh> voice 1*
[2:51:59] <ape_hawk> it baffles me that people would actually play WoW classic in this day and age
[2:52:12] <%SneakTheBeak> @doc_ock_rokc, I try, got my therapist tomorrow morning so we are gonna have some fun lol
[2:52:13] <+Rexton_Armos> I play with female voice 4 hue
[2:52:20] <FalseEyeD> Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
[2:52:28] <%Teintstein> Teintstein subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! @AngriestPat Happy 6 months of getting you to say taint stain with a bad british accent
[2:52:29] <RazHarvey> sure is
[2:52:33] <+cosinity> Where do you find the other rods? Coulda sworn I scoured the whole area but only found one
[2:52:35] <+allups> how do u get 3 of them whn thy only dorp once per roll
[2:52:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Some folks just really like waiting in line for quest turn-ins I guess
[2:52:38] <Ericgi231> The armor set from the rods is the best melee set in the game
[2:52:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ape_hawk Better then current wow
[2:52:39] <+Rezca> Its surprising me that its managing to attract people who never played the original WoW
[2:52:44] <+jjhoho> explore the bottom Kappa
[2:52:54] <ape_hawk> like, i get nostalgia, but quality of life stuff is kinda important, too
[2:53:01] <star_feline> exploring the DEEP bottom Kreygasm
[2:53:02] <Djinnazz> Cuz it's easier i guess.
[2:53:03] <%arcaderabbit48> I admit Im curious about WoW Classic, but not curious enough to actually buy WoW.
[2:53:17] <spinalwizard> @Brother_Coduss He touched a glowing red rock that was floating to get here. We are WAY past hand cancer
[2:53:19] <%InugamiTheHound> xcalLove xcalHacks xcalAngry
[2:53:19] <RazHarvey> people like wasting their life i guess. ITS IMMERSIVE Keepo
[2:53:19] <+Rezca> I played when it launched, with no desire to go back
[2:53:21] <+grim_abel> It's just rose tinted glasses making people want to relive the good ol' days.
[2:53:23] <Kurrisum> Just wait
[2:53:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ape_hawk but the price of the QOL was Quality of GAMEPLAY
[2:53:27] <%Nemesisnick33> Nemesisnick33 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:53:29] <+grim_abel> It's dumb but understandable
[2:53:33] <GoDZooKii> 2 rods are in dungeons 1 is only in playthrough 2, or join and get it off someones game.
[2:53:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Like the only thing I could see being appealing about WoW Classic is that things were a lot more wild west when that game was first starting out and not nearly as much of a theme park as current MMOs are
[2:53:37] <Caidezes> Kreygasm
[2:53:37] <$Brother_Coduss> exploring the bottom? make sure you use plenty of lube
[2:53:40] <%Nemesisnick33> apatWrong
[2:53:42] <%senorpapel> @ape_hawk it‚Äôs mostly because wow classic has a lot of old design methods that made for a different game experience. Current wow is like a beer you chug while older wow is more like a sipping whiskey
[2:53:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> classic WoW i could care less about, but if theres ever a WotLK server... ill be tempted
[2:53:43] <Xazrael666> The tension is palatable Pat
[2:53:45] <Djinnazz> Which weren't good at all because the game sux ass then.
[2:53:46] <%Teintstein> some guys switched from bottom to top?
[2:53:47] <+jjhoho> that's called a switch pat Kreygasm
[2:53:54] <Make_me_mad> The enemies are switch hitters.
[2:53:55] <star_feline> We call that verse pat Kreygasm
[2:53:57] <$Brother_Coduss> kinky
[2:54:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are these rune things you keep smashing? Is there a purpose? Are they spawners? Or are you getting scrap from them?
[2:54:09] <%senorpapel> Basically classic wow is a shittier ff14
[2:54:09] <+gatoralus> i'll probably end up playing some classic, but idk how long it will last, i just can't get into mmos in general as much nowadays
[2:54:12] <%arcaderabbit48> Does WoW Classic include stuff like later classes and races? Can you not play Panda or Death Knight in Classic? How commited to the bit are they?
[2:54:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Thing is I think there's ways you could do that kind of MMO today and do it better
[2:54:15] <+Rexton_Armos> for Scrap
[2:54:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel You mean you don't slam whiskey down by the bottle?
[2:54:23] <+grim_abel> They're fancy looking pots @FirearmsInstructor
[2:54:25] <%Order_of_Mystery> WotLK was the last time that game was good,imo
[2:54:26] <RiceeFTW> @FirearmsInstructor scrap, which is the currency back at the Ward
[2:54:29] <%InugamiTheHound> would pat ever bottom for a guy he has man crush on?
[2:54:30] <+grim_abel> For ingame currency
[2:54:32] <$Kaialb> wow big area
[2:54:33] <%king_wragles> @arcaderabbit48 it's vanilla WoW
[2:54:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> I need to stay away from MMOs at the moment not enough money to go around
[2:54:38] <NeroInfinite> Is this the labyrinth?
[2:54:38] <%senorpapel> Not if it‚Äôa the right whiskey. @king_wolf_rigger
[2:54:39] <RiceeFTW> @FirearmsInstructor oddly enough it's the currency even outside of the ward...
[2:54:40] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat why is this place full of goo
[2:54:42] <Make_me_mad> The map in the start menu is much better for figuring out where you haven't been yet.
[2:54:43] <star_feline> Hmm sure wish there was a sprint button now
[2:54:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Lemme know when they make EverQuest Classic
[2:54:46] <%arcaderabbit48> @king_wragles Ewwwwww, interest lost
[2:54:48] <Smart_ZaK1> The mini map doesn't seem that useful
[2:54:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @RiceeFTW thanks. I don't see an indicator anywhere showing he's getting stuff from em
[2:54:54] <+grim_abel> @NeroInfinite No
[2:54:58] <+KoyoTheBoyo> WoW so good that they had to roll back patches so people will play it again
[2:54:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @grim_abel thanks :)
[2:55:01] <RiceeFTW> mini map is very useful, just not for this zone LOL
[2:55:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel Okay, you got me there. What kind you like?
[2:55:03] <+Rezca> Minimap is not great for tiered levels
[2:55:12] <MavMarsh> it's really just this specific type of dungeon that has problems with the minimap

[2:55:44] <Smart_ZaK1> LMAO
[2:55:46] <RiceeFTW> this is all Quality of Life stuff that the devs said they'll get to, but there are other things to address first

[2:55:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I heard that's a huge complaint. The map / minimap is something that is left wanting.

[2:56:15] <%king_wragles> this IS Grimdark in 3rd person!
[2:56:17] <opossum_pal_ste> Why would you like to hide your helmet? @A123yourdead
[2:56:19] <$i_am_therydon> exterior collisions pat!
[2:56:26] <+grim_abel> A misleading map is worse than no map @AngriestPat
[2:56:26] <Sokumotanaka> Two bears higi fiving
[2:56:28] <Khorneflakes_> But if you include it, include criticism for it
[2:56:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No. *GOOD*, well designed, coherent maps are SUPER important in games. (That have them.)
[2:56:38] <+valkuma> and theyre random arent they
[2:56:42] <%worldbrand> I'm guessing the level layouts themselves are also somewhat procedural?
[2:56:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ive seen worse maps
[2:56:44] <madskull456> big lost
[2:56:44] <RazHarvey> level design leaves something to be desired yes
[2:56:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> hall wuggin' time
[2:56:47] <RiceeFTW> @grim_abel I dunno, I bet Warframe without a map would be the absolute WORST
[2:56:50] <+gatoralus> the devs are really cool in the discord and it seems like they are working on a lot of stuff for this post launch which is awesome
[2:56:51] <taterthrow> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper :/
[2:56:53] <NeroInfinite> lost
[2:56:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> This is a better 40k game than the last hundred they've been shitting out.
[2:56:53] <+Rezca> Door not found
[2:56:55] <+oOZtkOo> not here
[2:56:57] <foreverN2dust> rooShrug
[2:57:00] <thegraveyarder> sdf
[2:57:06] <+Rezca> Stick to level 2, not bottom floor
[2:57:07] <%senorpapel> Usually do crown royal if i‚Äôm doing some whiskey. @king_wolf_rigger
[2:57:09] <+grim_abel> Warframe's map works. Or I might just be super used to it
[2:57:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you smash the snowglobe things?
[2:57:19] <%Calek> can you break the glowy orbs
[2:57:20] <%worldbrand> @RiceeFTW that's goddamn true, i'm usually looking at the overlay map instead of what i'm actually shooting
[2:57:21] <+GenesisKnight> Maybe the door is on a different floor
[2:57:22] <thegraveyarder> what class did pat start with i jus got in
[2:57:24] <MavMarsh> yeah there should be an end to this
[2:57:29] <Make_me_mad> Doors in these dungeons are usually on the upper floors.
[2:57:30] <RiceeFTW> @grim_abel my point is more that if Warframe had a map like this, it'd still be better than having none at all LMAO
[2:57:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat statue?
[2:57:37] <%Bt_Robot> Can you go down and around it?
[2:57:42] <Kurrisum> Is there a map button on pS4?
[2:57:46] <star_feline> @thegraveyarder The cultist I believe?
[2:57:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Go back up, there was an indicator.
[2:57:59] <thegraveyarder> hanks
[2:58:01] <MavMarsh> there's no door button or anything you just have to not get lost
[2:58:07] <Make_me_mad> "The door is up" Pat says before he goes down
[2:58:07] <Khorneflakes_> Sounds right
[2:58:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel ahh, I'm a Knappogue Castle or Three Howls guy myself. For sipping whiskey anyways.
[2:58:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you smash those snowglobe / marble sphere things? They seem breakable.
[2:58:32] <+jjhoho> did someone say whiskey
[2:58:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> WHISKEY
[2:58:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> No but I'll have some
[2:58:47] <+jjhoho> i've got remnant in both screens why am i not sippin whiskey
[2:58:51] <%Calek> these particular dungeons are very confusing
[2:58:52] <+gatoralus> pat got big hammer for big strong patman
[2:58:54] <RiceeFTW> I really wish there was a freelook in this game, it'd be so much better
[2:59:00] <star_feline> FINALLY
[2:59:03] <+grim_abel> THAT WAS JUST A PASSAGE DUNGEON?!
[2:59:05] <%InugamiTheHound> took you like a hour for that one level
[2:59:06] <%Estuko> Oh shit pat Progressed so much, I recently beat the game. BOY THAT WAS A FIGHT LOL. @AngriestPat How are you enjoying it so far ??
[2:59:06] <+grim_abel> God damn
[2:59:08] <+griffball13> you....did it
[2:59:09] <+Rezca> Boss time
[2:59:09] <%arcaderabbit48> MAP SLAUGHTERED
[2:59:12] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[2:59:13] <+jjhoho> i wish the map wasn't just a big version of the minimap, which is shit
[2:59:14] <RazHarvey> TPFufun
[2:59:18] <42nfl19> wait was that the the entrance or exit?
[2:59:20] <thegraveyarder> oh i think got the big slashy boss
[2:59:21] <42nfl19> they look the same
[2:59:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> fucking crushed that map
[2:59:26] <MavMarsh> that was the exit
[2:59:31] <%senorpapel> Sounds solid, there‚Äôs actually a liquer i‚Äôve been trying to track down. Prickly pear liquer, tastes like watermelon bubblegum. @king_wolf_rigger
[2:59:37] <RiceeFTW> with every new zone, it'll scale +1 to your equipment level
[2:59:37] <%king_wragles> That explains a bit
[2:59:40] <FirearmsInstructor> Lower? How do you know?
[2:59:51] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel whoa, that sounds killer.
[2:59:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @senorpapel I've had some. Goes great in a margareta
[2:59:54] <wedgeff6> What game Is this? and was that a bonfire
[3:00:01] <%Calek> Rating vs Zone lower left @FirearmsInstructor
[3:00:03] <+grim_abel> There is a "Rating vs Zone" tab that shows
[3:00:05] <RiceeFTW> there's a minimum level though for certain zones
[3:00:08] <RiceeFTW> and certain bosses
[3:00:11] <+Rezca> Damn, never noticed that section
[3:00:14] <%Estuko> @FirearmsInstructor bottom left, Offence ^ Defense ^ so he's actually stronger than the zone if I'm right.
[3:00:33] <+Rexton_Armos> she sells a limit amount of upgrade material the refreshes on each Zone @angriestpat
[3:00:36] <+grim_abel> It's currently rating against Ward 13
[3:00:37] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko that's for the current zone that he's in, which is here at the Ward
[3:00:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @Calek @Estuko Ahhh thank you! I didn't see that at all. He's in and out of the menus so fast.
[3:01:00] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW I could've sworn I saw it before he left
[3:01:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat Yeah, the weighted average level of your gear is important. I'm getting the 3rd type of iron on Earth because I grinded early.
[3:01:04] <+gatoralus> the zones scale to your gearscore but not the traits, and you can level your gear up while at the zone to get bigger and stronger
[3:01:04] <%senorpapel> @doc_ock_rokc nice, what brand was it? Also was it just flavored or distilled prickly pears?
[3:01:11] <+MazDoThing> Three Edges is Insufficient, Five is too many. Only Four Edges will do
[3:01:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @Calek @Estuko I just thought he knew somehow, or that I was missing it. :)
[3:01:14] <+Rezca> Is... that a sex thing?
[3:01:15] <Kurrisum> You offence might be considered low now
[3:01:20] <%starotter70> Pat try saying She Sells Seashells by the Seashore
[3:01:24] <MavMarsh> yeah once you've maxed out your traits you are basically a god
[3:01:24] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko he was double diamond at the last zone he just completed, he'll be scaled down a little for the next zone
[3:01:26] <%ArcanumMBD> Is that eye Ron for Ed?
[3:01:28] <thegraveyarder> four edged
[3:01:41] <+Rexton_Armos> the game doesn't rescale until I you got to a new area
[3:01:45] <Kurrisum> Once the next zone "rolls"
[3:01:47] <+Rezca> Diamonds
[3:01:50] <RazHarvey> they're master works all, you can't go wrong TPFufun
[3:01:53] <+Rexton_Armos> ah yes
[3:01:54] <RiceeFTW> @Rexton_Armos not true, bosses have a minimum level
[3:01:56] <MavMarsh> oh shit is he getting the beam rifle
[3:01:58] <+LetsStartaRyate> Good luck. The reward here is well worth it.
[3:02:03] <RogerPoore> Is scaling +1 equipped or just in inventory?
[3:02:03] <%sshen> Mount farms are hell when someone just leaves after getting theirs
[3:02:04] <%ryome> ryome subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! All will become Binch! All will become one!
[3:02:05] <thegraveyarder> oh i never got this boss
[3:02:06] <+Rezca> Enjoy trying to live
[3:02:11] <spicyramengaming> @angriestpat Does this game have the in-depth weapon customization that Souls games had?
[3:02:11] <+Grayhammatter> hullo today
[3:02:14] <MavMarsh> this really is streamer luck
[3:02:14] <Kurrisum> It isnt a boss
[3:02:15] <thegraveyarder> oh wait i did, its just a wave boss

[3:02:39] <+griffball13> horde mode
[3:02:39] <NeroInfinite> YOU DID IT NOWP AT
[3:02:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @senorpapel Texas Prickly Pear Cactus Spirits
[3:02:45] <%Estuko> I didn't get this boss
[3:02:46] <Khorneflakes_> Time to hide in a corner
[3:02:46] <+MazDoThing> You Fool! You fell for it!
[3:02:48] <ALazo> run boy run
[3:02:48] <+Rexton_Armos> You in the pantry cause the mobs looking at you like a SNACK
[3:02:51] <RiceeFTW> @jcflyguy pat has gotten a god roll for his first run, it's actually insane
[3:02:54] <+grim_abel> RADIATION GOBLINS ATTACK
[3:02:56] <CertainlyNotTheFireNation> I have not been allowed to get this event yet in so many runs rooCry
[3:02:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> He'd better pop his little dudes
[3:03:00] <%senorpapel> Btw, how much do we have to donate to get an elmo stream? Where they just strap a camera to elmo for 24 hours
[3:03:02] <Smart_ZaK1> SMG is god tier
[3:03:08] <+Grayhammatter> the lost pantry PogChamp
[3:03:08] <+KingOfTheGeats> damn I got the hive boss wish I had this room instead
[3:03:08] <+Rezca> I hate this man's seed generation
[3:03:12] <%senorpapel> @doc_ock_rokc aww yeah that‚Äôs the good shit
[3:03:14] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat theres a full size machinegun that has a base damage higher than the SMG is now
[3:03:16] <+LetsStartaRyate> This weapon is definitely in my top 3. It just wrecks house.
[3:03:23] <+Rexton_Armos> my poison of choice is Knob Creek Maple Bourbon
[3:03:24] <SpaceGuntank> summon the gremlo!
[3:03:26] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[3:03:27] <RiceeFTW> @jcflyguy only thing that he maybe would've benefitted from this run woulda been getting singe rather than Ent
[3:03:34] <McAngrimStein> real gremlo hours who up
[3:03:43] <koffeemancer> I like that some weapon mods build up charges with their own damage
[3:03:43] <spinalwizard> Rocket launchers! Fire!
[3:03:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @senorpapel I'd say. Two glasses and I was almost passed out!
[3:03:53] <jcflyguy> Singe's sword is great.
[3:03:56] <RiceeFTW> @koffeemancer all the weapon mods build charge with their damage
[3:03:57] <spicyramengaming> Damn, that heal tho
[3:03:59] <Smart_ZaK1> use gremlos
[3:04:01] <%Calek> Singe's smg is fantastic
[3:04:11] <RiceeFTW> @koffeemancer because using a weapon mod is the same as doing damage with the actual weapon itself
[3:04:15] <MavMarsh> lol does the aim assist go towards your own summons
[3:04:21] <%senorpapel> Hell yeah, be careful cuz that stuff is delicious and ludicrously alcoholic. @doc_ock_rokc
[3:04:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @senorpapel Barely tastes like alchohol
[3:04:25] <RiceeFTW> @Calek facts, Spitfire is the shit, but so is the FLAME SWORD
[3:04:28] <%starotter70> sipsipHellmo It's time to release the Gremlos sipsipHellmo
[3:04:31] <wedgeff6> man that healing animation is very souls like
[3:04:34] <%Estuko> Melee works wonders against those skinny bastards
[3:04:46] <+Rezca> Poor minion...
[3:04:51] <RiceeFTW> you shot your minion :(
[3:04:51] <koffeemancer> Yeah but some are just buffs like the flame mod @RiceeFTW
[3:04:56] <%Estuko> I kinda wanna do a big buff melee build for funzies
[3:04:56] <SpaceGuntank> pat no, the gremlo are friends!
[3:05:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat DOGGO! I CHOOSE YOU! *Immediately lights up summoned pupper* ;(
[3:05:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @doc_ock_rokc I want to let you know I'm taking notes for the next time I hit up the liquor store lol
[3:05:08] <CertainlyNotTheFireNation> I feel like most of the summons act too slowly for alerted enemies
[3:05:10] <%Estuko> @SpaceGuntank oh god, Gremlo
[3:05:11] <NeroInfinite> Pat top shooting your own gremlins
[3:05:11] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Born to immediately get shot bu its master.
[3:05:18] <+Rezca> alright, will he finally use a consumable?
[3:05:22] <%InugamiTheHound> summons minion and the shoots it apatGoblin LOL
[3:05:23] <MavMarsh> that grenade is really good
[3:05:29] <RiceeFTW> @koffeemancer the fire damage will technically add mod power, but since it's active, it won't "add power". if you're doing fire damage after the mod ends, it'll build
[3:05:31] <+Rezca> I guess not...
[3:05:36] <+zaworldo> Pat's so good at video games
[3:05:47] <RiceeFTW> 1 REMAINING
[3:05:48] <RiceeFTW> 1 WHAT
[3:05:53] <+Grayhammatter> oh, he did it
[3:05:56] <+Rexton_Armos> So spoiler alert they do not attack from the back in the corner Pat was in
[3:05:58] <+Grayhammatter> NICE
[3:05:58] <+Rezca> Nice
[3:05:59] <+griffball13> NICE ONE

[3:07:57] <koffeemancer> @AngriestPat Adding the fire mod makes it a fire beam.

[3:08:08] <+allups> u mean its liek Zarya AKA best waifu
[3:08:09] <%logoth_> That looks like the least satisfying weapon to use
[3:08:09] <SleepyMaribo> ColdHeart's damage also increases the longer it hits a target

[3:08:11] <Ion_Laser> That's a BIG LAZOR
[3:08:12] <%hawk_rush> @Estuko @RiceeFTW lmao it also replenishes at a "bonfire", yeah?

[3:08:47] <%totesmcgoat_> Does it really have ramp up damage? That really is literally Coldheart
[3:08:49] <FalseEyeD> LUL

[3:09:01] <%hawk_rush> @Estuko @RiceeFTW lmaooo jeez, it wears its dark souls-like mechanics on its sleeves
[3:09:02] <Tucker0603> lol

[3:09:11] <ape_hawk> yeah, go play better mmos, like... literally anything else
[3:09:14] <gunzerkingdunce> @estuko you can get it early on. it's the anti stagger mod.
[3:09:15] <Trillex56> pat you still got the grenade launcher on or does lazer replace it?
[3:09:20] <FirearmsInstructor> 20 m is about 13 character-heights of distance... or 20 Patrick-heights...
[3:09:21] <ape_hawk> hell, even fallout 76 is better
[3:09:22] <%logoth_> MasterDecoder, wow classic released today
[3:09:23] <+grim_abel> It's really good for weak pointing targeting @AngriestPat
[3:09:23] <%Calek> @Estuko it doesn't you can get all the beginning stuff
[3:09:26] <RiceeFTW> @hawk_rush the devs already know, tbh they were the ones making jokes like that on streams LMAO. the dev called it a "smoke door" i was dying
[3:09:27] <thegraveyarder> 23k people in the wow classic queue PogChamp
[3:09:31] <+LetsStartaRyate> It melts bosses on weak point hits. Especially with the right traits and gear.
[3:09:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Viral+Hunter on a machine gun is ...evil
[3:09:33] <$ForTheBenmo> It's interesting watching Pat play it normally and having fun compared to speed runners hating themselves while playing it
[3:09:33] <+griffball13> pat is now broke
[3:09:33] <MasterDecoder> @logoth_ and?
[3:09:37] <Smart_ZaK1> Big lumenites
[3:09:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko beginning class don't matter for shit
[3:09:38] <@lewdskeletor13> WoW is an old mans game, Pat is too hip for that
[3:09:40] <+DingusMcFadden> Oh man, mixed messages on spooky quotient. ScaredyCat
[3:09:41] <+Rexton_Armos> Store refresh hype
[3:09:44] <%Estuko> @gunzerkingdunce that's damn good. Lol,
[3:09:53] <RiceeFTW> @hawk_rush oh and get this, to upgrade the items, you need "iron" that totally isn't titanite LUL
[3:09:54] <gunzerkingdunce> @estuko and no, you can respec once you beat the game and the other 2 class specific mods are sold by bitchy weapon girl
[3:09:56] <+DingusMcFadden> I, Ron

[3:10:02] <%hawk_rush> @RiceeFTW smoke door makes me think of a doorway covered in pollution

[3:10:06] <@lewdskeletor13> @dingusmcfadden I may have a higher tolerance for spooky so disregard my opinion
[3:10:08] <%logoth_> you asked "hurr 2019 wow??" so I answered you.
[3:10:10] <%Estuko> @Calek @King_Wolf_Rigger Yeah bitch that's what I wanna hear lmao, hella warrior bitch from another world here I come.

[3:10:24] <Kurrisum> Correct
[3:10:24] <+Rexton_Armos> yes
[3:10:24] <+gatoralus> @DingusMcFadden no the game is not really spooky at all, its got some freako enemy designs that are cool though
[3:10:26] <shurtal> Oh the eye-ronny
[3:10:27] <+Rezca> It was an optional dungeon
[3:10:27] <%Estuko> @gunzerkingdunce I kick her stuff all over the place because her attitude staying like shit is the worst
[3:10:29] <krymzen5> yes
[3:10:29] <+grim_abel> The reward was the rifle
[3:10:30] <%Odetokale> correct
[3:10:31] <%hawk_rush> @RiceeFTW oh woooooow
[3:10:32] <Rashnam> yeah, that looked like a dead end
[3:10:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait How does this Post apocoliptic guy that hasn't even seen a working computer know how to mod a radiation rifle?
[3:10:36] <%Calek> I got a different dead end dungeon
[3:10:38] <%aishman> Yeah dungeons with special shit at the end don't loop
[3:10:39] <FalseEyeD> The Baby

[3:10:41] <+LetsStartaRyate> Yup
[3:10:41] <Coystick> MEROW
[3:10:41] <spicyramengaming> I love the idea that this cheap, shitty metal is now hyper valuable and necessary LUL
[3:10:44] <%MoonObscure> MAO
[3:10:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Fook yeah! Big and stonk!
[3:10:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat WAIT... it says "Ideal range", not "max range". So does that mean it's maximum damage is around that? What does that mean?
[3:10:46] <%Calek> got myself a dumb melee weapon that I currently use
[3:10:47] <@lewdskeletor13> @doc_ock_rokc Shut up, that‚Äôs why
[3:10:48] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat he screm for hair
[3:10:48] <+grim_abel> My dead end was a skull flail
[3:10:48] <$valriot> Big yelling
[3:10:56] <RiceeFTW> @hawk_rush so basically any door that leads outside in Los Angeles? LUL
[3:10:58] <%beetbo2> apatPorgmo
[3:11:01] <gunzerkingdunce> @estuko she hooks us up with the hype shit, so she's tolerable
[3:11:02] <YohanTip> Are the "maps" randomly generated?
[3:11:03] <%Calek> @FirearmsInstructor you can shoot further than the ideal range, it just does less
[3:11:04] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib gin hair father apatGib
[3:11:05] <%arancet> elmo scream at universe

[3:11:19] <krymzen5> YOOO
[3:11:22] <%Estuko> @gunzerkingdunce tolerable enough to talk once every 2 hours lol
[3:11:26] <%cureneckbeard> elmo's scream is Pat's name in Cat language
[3:11:27] <Smart_ZaK1> Pretty good
[3:11:28] <Kurrisum> Another option, is using the "small" crystal and hit exit dungeon when it is a dead end like that
[3:11:29] <RiceeFTW> @hawk_rush yes and there's these elite mobs that happen to drop this special form of iron that's shiny and only works on boss weapons, totally not twinkling titanite
[3:11:30] <krymzen5> frickin lazers
[3:11:31] <%Estuko> someone's getting rocked
[3:11:32] <%logoth_> This game needs more RE2 adlibs
[3:11:32] <%dekkitout> Now to see if it's ammo enonomy is as bad as Coldhearts
[3:11:34] <%arcaderabbit48> That's a fucking laser

[3:13:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Your sperm are probably all dead now too, so that's cool
[3:13:11] <+DingusMcFadden> Are there dick shots in this game, chat?
[3:13:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @RiceeFTW What are you? Douchebag Opera?
[3:13:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko I'm really thinking about getting this game. I only know so much because I've been doing research to see if I should spend the money.
[3:13:15] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat fun fact, that much radiation would be making your enemies flesh melt as their cells broke down
[3:13:17] <EatMyVordts> fire cancer

[3:13:34] <+Rexton_Armos> If you think about it the cancer beam is probably making you SUPER clean
[3:13:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @senorpapel I'll have to give that a shot, I love a good stout.
[3:13:37] <luckyifpurple> I havent seen beams like this since my evil goku custom in saltybet
[3:13:38] <+griffball13> NOT FIRE CANCER
[3:13:40] <Trillex56> not too great against heavys tho

[3:13:45] <RiceeFTW> @FirearmsInstructor I just point my gun and they get cancer hggPicgun hggPicgun
[3:13:45] <%cureneckbeard> why is the pee beam orange now
[3:13:46] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger ask away lol, I beat the game recently so I know SOME stuff, lmao
[3:13:52] <gunzerkingdunce> Can other dimensional beings get cancer?
[3:13:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MavMarsh Witnessed
[3:13:56] <%InugamiTheHound> explosive spears/ javelins are cool
[3:13:58] <krymzen5> i like the shotty more 4 u tbh

[3:14:03] <RazHarvey> TPFufun
[3:14:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Anything can get cancer
[3:14:06] <ape_hawk> so is vaati making lore videos about this game?
[3:14:11] <+grim_abel> Cancer is the on thing I hope everything can get.
[3:14:11] <rufus2k2> feels weird having a talkative protagonist in a game like this
[3:14:13] <+Rezca> @Estuko did you ever solve that tree situation?
[3:14:15] <%Estuko> @lewdskeletor13 Cancer is available for everyone :)
[3:14:15] <krymzen5> even cancer
[3:14:16] <+Rexton_Armos> Pat if your peeing orange. Especially orange fire you may wanna see a doctor
[3:14:17] <NeroInfinite> Pffft
[3:14:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @lewdskeletor13 Can CANCER get cancer? D:
[3:14:22] <+Grubz5> classic wow just had a thanos snap and like half the population got kicked off of all realms. what a time to be alive. Pat is based for playing an actually good game instead of that trash
[3:14:23] <%arcaderabbit48> @lewdskeletor13 Except guinea pigs, I think? Or maybe that's diabetes
[3:14:25] <+DingusMcFadden> This thaing is fucking decent!!!!
[3:14:27] <rufus2k2> all gingers pee red
[3:14:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Does it have cells? It can get cancer

[3:14:29] <gunzerkingdunce> @rufus2k2 it gets annoying honestly
[3:14:34] <%residentfunko> @AngriestPat can't you just tap the shoot button to do more damage with that thing since the first shot seems to do more damage?
[3:14:36] <@lewdskeletor13> @firearmsinstructor Probably
[3:14:39] <%Estuko> @Rezca yeah I got that tree lol, I just didn't get the... monolith in the desert puzzle, I think I locked myself out of it somehow
[3:14:41] <thegraveyarder> did pat get invaded yet Kappa
[3:14:46] <%NovaKnightmare> @FirearmsInstructor there are cases of cancer being stopped by other forms of cancer
[3:14:48] <%logoth_> That is a Warhammer character
[3:14:49] <FirearmsInstructor> he mad :(
[3:14:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Cool. I'm mainly just wating now to see if my friends want to get it, and if it'll cut into the budget.
[3:14:50] <%Estuko> LOOK AT THAT RE4 CLAW ENEMY
[3:14:53] <krymzen5> can u get invaded?
[3:14:59] <gunzerkingdunce> no
[3:15:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Does cancer damage stack? That‚Äôs the real question
[3:15:02] <MavMarsh> no pvp in this
[3:15:06] <RiceeFTW> but can you weaponize the cancer with nanomachines? hggShaq hggShaq hggShaq
[3:15:07] <MavMarsh> devs said they might put it in
[3:15:07] <%totesmcgoat_> How is the fart gas level in this game?
[3:15:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> yet
[3:15:12] <+Rezca> oh god.. he basically is that Claw guy from RE4
[3:15:13] <%logoth_> Is there a diabetes gun?
[3:15:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @NovaKnightmare HA! Can't kill me if I'm already dead, idiot! :P
[3:15:14] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger ooohhh, okay, there's also public too for randos. but friends first, and it's just as fun alone too.
[3:15:15] <+DingusMcFadden> So this is basically The Division meets souls=-ike?
[3:15:16] <MavMarsh> oh wait there is one pvp thing
[3:15:21] <Khorneflakes_> LUL cohhAim
[3:15:23] <%worldbrand> alright my own download's done so i'm hopping in! thanks for selling me on the game!
[3:15:25] <RiceeFTW> @logoth_ ah yes, CANDY BEAM
[3:15:28] <@lewdskeletor13> @dingusmcfadden That‚Äôs pretty accurate.
[3:15:32] <+Rexton_Armos> fart gas will happen don't you worry my friend
[3:15:34] <thegraveyarder> theres no pvp but theres friendly fire
[3:15:36] <rufus2k2> @gunzerkingdunce their tough guy act is kinda meh yeah, though I appreciate the "waves of enemies are done" dialogue
[3:15:37] <ape_hawk> is this technically blighttown?
[3:15:38] <%MelBrooksKA> @lewdskeletor13 I does bonus damage to friends and family
[3:15:40] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger you can get weapons/armour from choices the host makes too, that is unavailable/undecided yet in your own world. it only effects their world
[3:15:41] <krymzen5> huge
[3:15:41] <Paperware> Whenever I see a laser beam nowadays I always hear TIS ROZAIN in Miriam's voice
[3:15:45] <%Estuko> @ape_hawk not yet.
[3:15:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Is melee a viable way to play? I like the idea of beefing that up and cruching foo's
[3:15:57] <+Rexton_Armos> not really
[3:16:02] <+Rexton_Armos> its fun though
[3:16:02] <MavMarsh> melees viable once you've got all the relevant traits and gear
[3:16:02] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger for the whole game? probably not, there are some bosses that are literally impossible to melee
[3:16:04] <%NovaKnightmare> is this fucking Mos Eisley?
[3:16:04] <ape_hawk> i forget, did pat ever finish The Surge?
[3:16:06] <%ColonelRozum> no its not a mele game lol
[3:16:11] <thegraveyarder> theres bosses that you cannot melee
[3:16:12] <MavMarsh> takes a long time to get all that tho
[3:16:14] <implied_consent> !uptime
[3:16:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 16m.
[3:16:15] <Kurrisum> BTW Heavy Water Elixir is you anti rad
[3:16:15] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger but you can melee for a huge majority of the game
[3:16:19] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger Yeah, but imo I recommend range to learn how the gameplay works, because it's weird getting used to things. And some bosses require guns
[3:16:20] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL did he just javellan his friend in the ass?
[3:16:26] <gunzerkingdunce> @king_wolf_rigger partially, there are bosses where you can only shoot.
[3:16:28] <Smart_ZaK1> That thing just melts enemies
[3:16:32] <+grim_abel> Enemies can friendly fire yeah
[3:16:34] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger but you can also grab BIG GUN to help you with that too
[3:16:35] <+DingusMcFadden> Kind sir, won't you fuck off?
[3:16:35] <RiceeFTW> all the enemies have friendly fire
[3:16:38] <%Estuko> @grim_abel helps in bosses
[3:16:43] <RiceeFTW> even in co-op there is friendly fire
[3:16:44] <rufus2k2> a big guy..for you
[3:16:48] <miabyte> dem some angry bois
[3:16:52] <RazHarvey> I will destroy you with my wazer wifle BabyRage
[3:16:55] <rufus2k2> that spear scraped your helmet
[3:16:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat y u always shoot the dik? ;-;

[3:16:59] <%Estuko> @RazHarvey uwu*
[3:17:01] <implied_consent> How are the bosses in this game?
[3:17:11] <ape_hawk> now you can put all your traits into the dump stats
[3:17:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Sweet. Yeah, definitely into the gunplay, but crushing mobs with melee is always fun.
[3:17:15] <spicyramengaming> The environments in this game seem really boring tho
[3:17:18] <Zombrocom> @implied_consent Adds. Adds and more adds.
[3:17:18] <@lewdskeletor13> @implied_consent A lot of them have too many adds it seems
[3:17:19] <$Kuro_Koshka> I would say Pat is deaf but he's not wearing headphones so no far less directional cues
[3:17:20] <+KoyoTheBoyo> cancer mage

[3:17:27] <%starotter70> Flaming Cancer
[3:17:31] <%Estuko> @implied_consent I think they're cool, the ads for ammo though CAN make a difference lol. so it requires knowing how to clear the way and forcing you to learn how to kill ads fast
[3:17:31] <+grim_abel> Now he can actually buff his character

[3:28:32] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger slow, gotta know how to aim. But on Hard, I was using single bolts to take down enemies in a single hit. It's sexy too, goes amazing with slayer armour that gives 35% damage buff to next hit after reload, and being single shot... well..

[3:30:06] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger OH lol, it's a really cool game though. big hit for me that I enjoy, all weapons are viable. I still use the pistole from the beginning of the game

[3:31:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko I did not expect them to do such a good job on balance. I've been craving a fun shooter experience for awhile and nothing's really scratched that itch. Might take the dive and get it after the stream.

[3:35:39] <+Pomer> @Roasted_Pheasant rip and... t-tear?
[3:35:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> I can't play games with dogs when at my mah's house because one of the dogs can see and recognize dogs on the screen
[3:35:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Is it possible to play with a friend who's low level if you have a stonked out character? I might be getting before some friends but still want to help them out.
[3:35:46] <%Estuko> LUL
[3:35:53] <Valdorick> Pah, Mediocre.
[3:35:55] <MavMarsh> he used a consumable
[3:35:55] <%Estuko> @KingOfTheGeats yeah

[3:36:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Pomer big rip big tears such doom very wow
[3:36:11] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger you can have multiple characters
[3:36:13] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger just straight from the menu or even steam friendslist.
[3:36:15] <%senorpapel> @doc_ock_rokc she must have a really fast tv then
[3:36:16] <+Pomer> tomatoDry
[3:36:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
[3:36:26] <Rashnam> bleeding is probably the one status effect I don't bother trying to muscle though
[3:36:35] <%Estuko> Is it worth even doing multiple characters? OR just beefing the hell out of just one
[3:36:36] <Ion_Laser> FEAR IS HOW I FALL
[3:36:36] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> the scaling for being higher level is kinds fucky though
[3:36:41] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I've always liked the idea of beings with a totally different type of morphology to humans despite having humanoid forms. Like how The Root and Dark Souls Demons are made of trees and root matter instead of flesh
[3:36:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW @Estuko neato burrito
[3:36:44] <Valdorick> confusing how I feel
[3:36:44] <MavMarsh> should just be a straight run to the next dungeon now
[3:36:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Confusing, what is real?
[3:36:49] <phrickshun> I wouldn't power through Root Rot (infected) Though
[3:36:53] <phrickshun> That's rough
[3:37:00] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko depends, I have 1 for solo (NG+++++) and another for co-op (trait level 60) lol
[3:37:04] <ScreamLord> It's a trap!
[3:37:05] <+Pomer> @Estuko You get a respec item after you beat the final boss, and you can buy more of it
[3:37:05] <%Estuko> @ScreamLord I'm huge into the tree demons, super otherworldly
[3:37:06] <Valdorick> You killed them so hard, they're giving up!
[3:37:06] <@lewdskeletor13> On a horse with no name?
[3:37:07] <krymzen5> must be french
[3:37:10] <Kaialb> Oh no...

[3:37:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> This earth?
[3:37:31] <FalseEyeD> The FRENCH Canadian is quick to notice the flag of surrender.

[3:37:41] <+oOZtkOo> this is rhom, not earth

[3:37:44] <Saltmeisterr> where the fuck are we
[3:37:44] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat this place has 2 suns
[3:37:47] <%ColonelRozum> @Roasted_Pheasant no
[3:37:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I thought Rhom was a spider
[3:37:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @senorpapel he is smart enough to be one
[3:37:56] <%Estuko> @Saltmeisterr Nebraska
[3:38:00] <Saltmeisterr> I thought we where in cityville
[3:38:01] <RiceeFTW> Pat just destroying entire villages of natives using his evil european weapons :(
[3:38:02] <%NovaKnightmare> god this is just Tatooine
[3:38:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat You are on tatooine!
[3:38:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The darksign is just Griffith calling down the god hand.
[3:38:08] <Valdorick> You can infact stare at a full solar eclipse!... Though a magic one? Yeah no, don't get the megacancer.
[3:38:16] <%MelBrooksKA> Or a solar radiation bleached flag
[3:38:16] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW For Pat, it was tuesday
[3:38:17] <Saltmeisterr> no beszerk
[3:38:20] <%Faustgesicht> GOOD TIP
[3:38:26] <ScreamLord> @Estuko Also demons physically made of smoke and shadows. Like the Hym in the Witcher 3
[3:38:26] <MavMarsh> oh boy another vyr dungeon
[3:38:28] <%Calek> all glowy doors are dungeons
[3:38:30] <+Rezca> Well, the evillest european weapon was sickness
[3:38:31] <miabyte> whoever made this area clearly liked stargate
[3:38:31] <Smart_ZaK1> Another dungeon
[3:38:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Valdorick Its not cancer you have to worry about
[3:38:36] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko but it's monday monkaS
[3:38:37] <%king_wragles> Unless that lens flare is coming off the moon, there are 2 suns
[3:38:42] <%Bt_Robot> When you press B an move forward, you can do the duck walk!
[3:38:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Welcome to Don Jon
[3:38:44] <%senorpapel> Game‚Äôs saying pat doesn‚Äôt crouch enough
[3:38:47] <%InugamiTheHound> another one!
[3:38:49] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is cool man
[3:38:52] <%Estuko> @ScreamLord I got tired of smoke and shadow monsters tbh, the wood demons was a nice touch
[3:38:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> why swing hammer Pat?
[3:38:54] <Saltmeisterr> that looks like a dungo
[3:39:09] <RiceeFTW> lord at least Pat didn't get the seed I got, I had the one where you get a gross debuff that saps HP every second
[3:39:13] <%Estuko> BIG BOYS NOW PAT
[3:39:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol for a second I thought you were trying to play baseball with that guy's energy projectile and your hammer. ;D
[3:39:20] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat BIG ARMOUR SMALL HEADS
[3:39:21] <krymzen5> seems it
[3:39:22] <RiceeFTW> it's possible, yes
[3:39:24] <+Rezca> Weakpoint in neck
[3:39:26] <MavMarsh> radiation enemies take less radiation damage
[3:39:26] <+gatoralus> i think they might have radiation resistance
[3:39:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> It does Radiation and they are Radiation based
[3:39:27] <RiceeFTW> since they deal radiation
[3:39:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> They don't seem to be flesh
[3:39:28] <+Pomer> @AngriestPat the enemies do have resistences
[3:39:38] <+zaworldo> Rad damage bad against rad boys
[3:39:40] <%Bt_Robot> They're all radiation spewing monsters, makes sense
[3:39:41] <%logoth_> Crap!
[3:39:41] <Smart_ZaK1> Fire might do more damage
[3:39:43] <borous> it's a nuke weapon, these guys all got nuked already so...
[3:39:45] <ScreamLord> @Estuko Yeah, it's a fresh idea at the least. Don't think tree demons was much of a thing before Dark Souls and Remnant
[3:39:45] <+zaworldo> Pull out the shotgun
[3:39:47] <%Estuko> monkaS different foot steps
[3:39:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Dat lever action is good shit tho
[3:39:51] <@lewdskeletor13> We found a cancer resistant enemy boys sipsipHellmo
[3:39:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat btw I noticed their masks explode and are destroyed with enough damage.
[3:40:09] <RiceeFTW> hunting rifle is easily the best balanced weapon in the game
[3:40:12] <%Estuko> @ScreamLord I like that OTHER worlds have beaten them, instead of "EVERYONE DIED AND NOW EARTH IS NEXT"
[3:40:14] <RiceeFTW> devs said they tuned the entire game around that weapon
[3:40:15] <+Pomer> @AngriestPat The advanced stats show you how effective your armor and weapons are in a zone
[3:40:18] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @riceeftw i had that one earlier in the level, got a neat flail out of it. after failing like 15 times
[3:40:33] <RiceeFTW> @The_Lady_Alustriel I enjoyed the flail until I picked up the sickle :)
[3:40:35] <%king_wragles> @RiceeFTW the beam rifle? Seems about right.
[3:40:36] <%Gray_skies1993> !uptime
[3:40:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 40m.
[3:40:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is it mean of me to want a shotgun in a game that does massive damage at point blank and to call it "Old Yeller"
[3:40:52] <RiceeFTW> @king_wragles naw the Hunting Rifle, the beam rifle is really broken with Devouring Loop though
[3:40:53] <%Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc :(
[3:40:59] <%king_wragles> ooohhh
[3:41:01] <@lewdskeletor13> @doc_ock_rokc Nah that‚Äôs on brand
[3:41:13] <RiceeFTW> monkaS
[3:41:16] <%Estuko> BIG BOY
[3:41:22] <%Estuko> monkaS
[3:41:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko That is a cool about the story. I also like how the worlds that won basically nuked everything into oblivion. Like, "Fuck you plants! Not your planet!"
[3:41:24] <Smart_ZaK1> YOOOO
[3:41:24] <AmericanaRed> who said that
[3:41:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thanosed
[3:41:25] <MavMarsh> like how everyone in tf2 calls their shotgun "kurt cobain's microphone"
[3:41:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Ded
[3:41:25] <+Rezca> Nice moves
[3:41:27] <%starotter70> Ow
[3:41:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> Yo Ded
[3:41:27] <krymzen5> DAMN
[3:41:27] <Ion_Laser> rekt
[3:41:29] <Rashnam> This area took me several tries to get though. Glad they fixed the construct's weak point, though.
[3:41:31] <BakerBrute> F
[3:41:31] <%NovaKnightmare> fucking buffass skeleton
[3:41:32] <%king_wragles> oof
[3:41:33] <%Bt_Robot> Wouldn't it be cool if one of those statues came to life and was a super tough enemy?
[3:41:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Who was that darksider guy?
[3:41:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are the damage types? Ballistic / Energy / ??? etc. (Also you can mod them with fire and other things?)
[3:41:40] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger I recommend it, it's really cool
[3:41:41] <%cureneckbeard> Ê≠ª
[3:41:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MavMarsh Holy shit
[3:41:42] <@lewdskeletor13> This area ain‚Äôt fucking around
[3:41:43] <RiceeFTW> @Rashnam oh yeah, the weakpoint used to be literally like 3-4 pixels LMFAO
[3:41:50] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat hey Pat, have you taken a break to read dono's and subscriptions yet? or just been going ham this whole time?
[3:41:52] <+Pomer> @King_Wolf_Rigger and later on he gives you a quest, and you can tell him to fuck off, initiating a fight.
[3:42:00] <RiceeFTW> hunting rifle really good
[3:42:02] <blink289> I love the beamgun
[3:42:06] <ScreamLord> @Estuko That was actually a cool detail I read in the wiki. The Rhom kicked the Root's asses and now we're dealing with the shitty, but still powerful remnants of the original army. But The Rhom still took a big hit beating them
[3:42:07] <%Estuko> LMAO
[3:42:10] <%Estuko> MOVE BITCH HE SAID
[3:42:11] <Smart_ZaK1> Rifle seems good
[3:42:11] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:42:11] <%senorpapel> @doc_ock_rokc it could be mean, but only of me naming my tf2 flamethrower ‚Äúdanny‚Äù is mean.
[3:42:12] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[3:42:12] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[3:42:13] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:42:17] <+seaearthandsky> LUL that was great
[3:42:21] <blink289> you do beamgun plus weak point extra damage
[3:42:23] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp
[3:42:24] <MavMarsh> @doc_ock_rokc the shock factor really wears off when you see it every other game
[3:42:25] <+Rezca> headshots
[3:42:26] <blink289> it can decimate
[3:42:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Pomer Ooh, I do like the sound of that.
[3:42:34] <%Estuko> @ScreamLord that one tyrant is still a dick lol
[3:42:35] <thegreenbenis> DO HEAD SHOTS
[3:42:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MavMarsh still its good
[3:42:38] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger well, the Root is basically just The Flood from Halo lol
[3:42:39] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat if you can afford the time to aim, the rifle seems really good
[3:42:40] <Rashnam> @RiceeFTW Yeah. Seemed like I usually hit it by accident when they bent down after taking damage
[3:42:47] <+Pomer> @King_Wolf_Rigger you get a sickass weapon for it too
[3:42:54] <+scrubz_413> So is this gun souls
[3:42:56] <madogod> dark souls with guns?
[3:42:57] <+Pomer> and you can skip the swamp
[3:43:06] <+Rezca> he really likes this beam
[3:43:09] <+Robopengy> Pat liking the game better than Stirling did?
[3:43:12] <blink289> aim for head
[3:43:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pomer not everyone gets the swamp
[3:43:15] <krymzen5> huh
[3:43:17] <RiceeFTW> that takes TONS of ammo to do
[3:43:17] <%XzileGaming> yea. terrible
[3:43:18] <%Gray_skies1993> @madogod Gun Souls, technically
[3:43:19] <%Estuko> @Pomer no, I wanna see him do blighttown lol
[3:43:20] <@lewdskeletor13> @robopengy Way more I think
[3:43:21] <+AllenAfro> hit the head pat
[3:43:22] <MavMarsh> he didn't get rekt by the ent so yea
[3:43:25] <thegreenbenis> @madogod It's Tom Clancy's dark souls.
[3:43:28] <+trackles_64> At least theres still one streamer not doing wow
[3:43:28] <+scrubz_413> Gun souls
[3:43:29] <Djinnazz> Pewuuuuuu!
[3:43:33] <thegreenbenis> DO HEAD SHOTS
[3:43:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Robopengy Yes because pat isn't a hack
[3:43:35] <+Pomer> @Estuko horrible FPS and all.
[3:43:41] <%Estuko> LUL these aren't even mini bosses
[3:43:42] <+zaworldo> Just use the hunting rifle,
[3:43:45] <ScreamLord> Lever-Action Laser Beam. Haven't seen that before
[3:43:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW Yeah lol, I noticed. It's kinda cool. Of course, you could also say they're like the Tyranids.
[3:43:49] <Kain5707> @doc_ock_rokc wait really do they get a different biome?
[3:44:07] <sirrice77> i'd max out your vigor pat
[3:44:08] <a_mad_dragon> VIGOR WORST STAT
[3:44:09] <+Rezca> There are traits for guns
[3:44:10] <blink289> exploiter
[3:44:12] <GalaxyCrusher> !uptime
[3:44:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:12] <Smart_ZaK1> Exploiter is a really good one
[3:44:16] <%cureneckbeard> Put luck to fifty. Have lucky faith
[3:44:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Kain5707 its randomized for the most part you only see about half the game the first time through
[3:44:22] <Valdorick> Wait, does he rank 20 eldritch?
[3:44:25] <FirearmsInstructor> wtf gun is that
[3:44:27] <%starotter70> Random question, but are there any games where the dick is a weak point like head shots?
[3:44:29] <+trackles_64> shooting at walls now
[3:44:38] <+Rezca> @Valdorick yeah, he maxed it
[3:44:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> aww yeah, chat already going back and forth about if a stat is good or trash.
[3:44:44] <DSD24> @starotter70 Saints Row 2
[3:44:49] <RazHarvey> @starotter70 MGS2 dood
[3:44:49] <%Estuko> monkaS they travel in packs
[3:44:49] <thegreenbenis> Head shots.
[3:44:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @starotter70 there was a few in the early 00s but I can't remember them at the moment
[3:44:52] <Kain5707> @doc_ock_rokc i got 4 on my first run city, desert, swamp and forest
[3:44:53] <%BubbaRands> nice dodge
[3:44:56] <RiceeFTW> @starotter70 there's a few bosses here where the weakpoint is literally their buttcheeks
[3:44:57] <%SneakTheBeak> @starotter70 sniper elite
[3:45:00] <Valdorick> @starotter70 Oh god, gonna age myself here... Pico's Quest.
[3:45:00] <Ion_Laser> F
[3:45:03] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat BIG BOY HOUSE NOW

[3:45:09] <blink289> tip for this area
[3:45:11] <VERDAXY> welp
[3:45:15] <%Gray_skies1993> hey chat, can you all see the messages I type? just curious b/c I think my internet is shitting on me lol
[3:45:15] <%Mr_Pylon> Seems like you need to stick and move with the big guys
[3:45:15] <%Wintermute_VRC> is this game hard
[3:45:20] <blink289> use the ring that stacks damage on kills
[3:45:20] <VERDAXY> that hurt
[3:45:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Defense vs zone == bad ;(
[3:45:27] <Valdorick> Yes, @Gray_skies1993
[3:45:29] <+Probliterator> I love this place, it reminds me so much of Stargate and/or Fifth Element
[3:45:31] <RiceeFTW> @Wintermute_VRC on Hard, yes, but Pat is playing on Normal and still getting washed LUL
[3:45:35] <+scrubz_413> You died
[3:45:35] <BlindGato> Shotgun did well here
[3:45:41] <%Wintermute_VRC> yikes
[3:45:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MAX RANGE
[3:45:45] <+Rezca> Old reliable
[3:45:47] <viciousgrim> you can do the story
[3:45:55] <%Gray_skies1993> thx! felt crazy for a sec there @Valdorick

[3:46:00] <+zaworldo> nerd*
[3:46:00] <MavMarsh> this is a mandatory dungeon too
[3:46:01] <+GenesisKnight> Good ol' faithful
[3:46:02] <RiceeFTW> why no shoulder switch hggTom
[3:46:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Crits cause stager!
[3:46:08] <MavMarsh> gonna be some big oofs
[3:46:17] <+zaworldo> It's LITERALLY BETTER THO
[3:46:21] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW I learned that by accident 80% of the game through lol
[3:46:22] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I'm in the same area wow you're fast PogChamp
[3:46:28] <blink289> the shotgun upgraded is also good here
[3:46:35] <Kain5707> farming?
[3:46:38] <+Pomer> @doc_ock_rokc i mean the whole like. swamp world, whatever it's name is. basically you merc him and he drops the item you get for his quest, meaning you can go straight to... the last world. It's still worth going to the swamp for bee wife.
[3:46:43] <blink289> it does like 260 damage
[3:46:46] <%king_wragles> @Kain5707 testing what weapons he likes atm
[3:46:46] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko it's so useful, especially since some enemies attack through walls smh
[3:46:50] <Kain5707> ah
[3:47:04] <+scrubz_413> Is this gun souls
[3:47:06] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW those crossbow/teleporting pricks
[3:47:07] <%Bt_Robot> Time to BECOME GIANT in between sessions.
[3:47:14] <%Roasted_Pheasant> If you aren't farming then why is that pitchfork standing right behind you
[3:47:17] <%king_wragles> @scrubz_413 yes actually
[3:47:23] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko lmao yeah it can get kinda funky sometimes
[3:47:46] <RiceeFTW> easier to PogChamp
[3:47:52] <Kain5707> @Pomer i gave the heart to tall boi though mizzQQ
[3:47:52] <+scrubz_413> Well that‚Äôs cool
[3:47:54] <RiceeFTW> with headshots
[3:47:58] <koffeemancer> Chat, quick question: Is the chinese typewriter good or bad?
[3:48:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Bad
[3:48:05] <RiceeFTW> chinese typewriter
[3:48:08] <RiceeFTW> im dead
[3:48:09] <MavMarsh> chinese typewriter...
[3:48:09] <+Rezca> still trying to find a good weapon?
[3:48:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Cause it's a typewriter
[3:48:17] <stealtharwing> Is this game pretty much Dark Souls but with guns?
[3:48:19] <BakerBrute> ???
[3:48:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chicago Typewriter?
[3:48:22] <RiceeFTW> it's the CHICAGO TYPEWRITER cuz it's a TOMMY GUN LMAO
[3:48:23] <%Wintermute_VRC> looks like the ranged ones fire in volleys of three
[3:48:23] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat cqc will be roug, but I think the revolver and shotty will do you fine
[3:48:29] <RiceeFTW> CHINESE TYPEWRITER IM DYING AHAHA
[3:48:30] <%GarbageNirvana> You know what I'm not seeing in this game? The kind of cheap shit Souls games can get you with sometimes
[3:48:32] <Kain5707> yes @stealtharwing pretty much
[3:48:34] <%Estuko> @koffeemancer depends what language you want, bad for english. but for Chinese, it's AMAZING
[3:48:36] <BakerBrute> Lmao the chinese typewriter
[3:48:37] <+Pomer> @Kain5707 eh you're good, you missed a kinda cool armor set for 1 round clip weapons, but bandit is still better for overall DPS. just kick his ass in world re-roll
[3:48:42] <%Roasted_Pheasant> The chinese typewriter falls apart like their motorcycles
[3:48:45] <%senorpapel> @riceeftw okay so i wasn‚Äôt the only one confused
[3:48:49] <blink289> @stealtharwing its more a shlooter with dark souls lite elements
[3:48:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Like there's not any artificial difficulty "gotcha" moments
[3:48:59] <KorysHere> if only you could mod melee weapons, be cool to see whatd theyd look like
[3:49:00] <+Pomer> his fight is. kind of a real motherfucker.
[3:49:08] <Kain5707> @Pomer oh i didnt get armor he only gave me a scythe vargRip
[3:49:08] <BakerBrute> @koffeemancer is a comedic genious
[3:49:12] <%ArcanumMBD> @blink289 it's not a shlooter. the loot is fixed drops like dark souls
[3:49:12] <koffeemancer> Lol I'm dyslexic so I seriously read as chinese, oops
[3:49:16] <RiceeFTW> this room is a fiesta
[3:49:19] <HatingSince87> so this game worth full price or should I wait for a price drop/sale?
[3:49:25] <+Pomer> you get the armor for giving the heart to the other option.
[3:49:35] <%GarbageNirvana> It's 40 bucks so it's up to you if that's worth it or not I guess
[3:49:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you bait / pull smaller groups? You seem to have lulls then get swarmed in combat. Can you trigger less enemies? (Seems like they're all linked, but it might help to try?)
[3:49:43] <%senorpapel> @koffeemancer to answer the question, it is very good. If you upgrade it
[3:49:43] <%Roasted_Pheasant> These boys are gross
[3:49:45] <%Estuko> imo it's worth, I'm having a lot of fun
[3:49:49] <+Probliterator> They're coming from everywhere man, THEY'RE IN THE WALLS!
[3:49:53] <RiceeFTW> i got this game by selling CS:GO skins so it was "free" :^)
[3:50:00] <%Calek> @FirearmsInstructor they just come out of nowhere
[3:50:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Game over, Epic Gamer, game over
[3:50:09] <Djinnazz> THey still allow that shit?
[3:50:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Game over man! Game Over!
[3:50:22] <MavMarsh> enemies basically spawn in clusters
[3:50:30] <+Pomer> @Djinnazz ofc, you know how much money Valve makes from the skin market?
[3:50:40] <+Pomer> imagine taxing weed and triple it
[3:50:44] <koffeemancer> @senorpapel oh ok, i was just wondering seeing as it takes a couple of seconds of firing to aim straight
[3:50:45] <blink289> yeah if you put on the sun jewel ring tthat stacks up to 4 times per kill every 10 seconds it totally helps in this zone
[3:50:49] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Daily reminder that Epic Games Store exists and is killing every game.
[3:50:58] <%Estuko> LUL I wanted pat to turn around to run, only to get shot at by the monster so I Can yell "RICKYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
[3:51:07] <RiceeFTW> way worse than weed tax, they take like 15% of your cut AND it's not even real money, it's their virtual valve dollars smh LMAO
[3:51:11] <+Rezca> Roll through it
[3:51:14] <%InugamiTheHound> epic game store still doesn't have a shopping cart
[3:51:17] <%starotter70> When Paige has small conversations with Pat does she call it a "Pat Chat"
[3:51:18] <blink289> its needed for solo runs
[3:51:25] <+Pomer> @RiceeFTW indeed
[3:51:26] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @InugamiTheHound YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDIN
[3:51:27] <blink289> this game is killer without help
[3:51:31] <%senorpapel> @koffeemancer it does, but it can be upgraded to infinite ammo and it gets to red 9 levels of power
[3:51:33] <%Estuko> @starotter70 just "small talk"
[3:51:45] <%senorpapel> We talking re4 right?
[3:51:50] <blink289> btw did pat ever discover running vaults
[3:51:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hey after this you'll earn your armor and ring. It'll all be worth it. :)
[3:51:53] <+Rezca> This level of scrubbing the stage
[3:51:54] <%Calek> anyone ever do the Citadel Curse side dungeon?
[3:52:04] <Kain5707> i did
[3:52:05] <%Estuko> @Calek FUCK THAT
[3:52:05] <%starotter70> @Estuko oh, that's way better
[3:52:07] <Kain5707> it sucked lol
[3:52:15] <%Estuko> @Calek took me two god damn tries
[3:52:17] <Rashnam> all in all, you're doing quite well, Pat
[3:52:19] <MavMarsh> it's a lot easier once you have a lot of dragon hearts
[3:52:19] <+Pomer> Wait hold on what's running vaults i have not heard of this
[3:52:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Dat big armour lookin good right about now
[3:52:24] <%Bt_Robot> Did you check out the left branch?
[3:52:26] <+scrubz_413> @roasted_pheasant yes I know
[3:52:31] <RiceeFTW> @Calek yeah on hard mode that took me like 3 times my first run through smh LMAO
[3:52:31] <%Calek> @Estuko knowing that killing enemies gives you health back made it a lot easier
[3:52:37] <shurtal> Straight cash, homie
[3:52:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol
[3:52:42] <%Estuko> @Calek oh, I just ran like hell..
[3:52:44] <Djinnazz> Mental Mapping!
[3:52:44] <%ArcanumMBD> time for some chunneling
[3:52:44] <%InugamiTheHound> LOL

[3:52:50] <Kain5707> @Calek thats true i didnt realize that until like many deaths LUL

[3:52:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chunnel and hall wug!
[3:52:59] <Rashnam> Hall wugging time?
[3:53:01] <Ion_Laser> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[3:53:02] <Smart_ZaK1> Exterior collisions boyo
[3:53:04] <+GenesisKnight> Time for some Hall Wuggin
[3:53:04] <SpaceGuntank> just spin around and pick a random direction
[3:53:08] <blink289> did you ever find the dogman?
[3:53:09] <%Keeble24> Exterior collisions
[3:53:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatBig apatGoblin
[3:53:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Btw the guys with the lance-ball-projectiles seem so fuck you up with their timing and your rolls. Staggering them seems to cause you the least damage, in my observation.
[3:53:13] <$drfaustisdead> Eat all of the dungeon Pat. Every, last, bite.
[3:53:14] <%BubbaRands> woot hug them walls
[3:53:19] <%Jp3g95> whiff
[3:53:31] <blink289> you can go toward the skull
[3:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> procedual
[3:53:38] <FirearmsInstructor> HALL WUG
[3:53:45] <FirearmsInstructor> HALL WUGGIN!
[3:53:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> This architecture makes me think Quake 2
[3:54:00] <RiceeFTW> the skull is the enemy difficulty
[3:54:01] <MavMarsh> the skull just tells you the difficulty level
[3:54:05] <MavMarsh> bronze is normal
[3:54:11] <RiceeFTW> normal mode, hard mode, or nightmare
[3:54:12] <+zaworldo> not playing on nightmare
[3:54:14] <+Mullet_Warrior> Bronze means you're playing on normal
[3:54:15] <+zaworldo> wtf pat
[3:54:19] <%ArcanumMBD> evil techno orb
[3:54:23] <RiceeFTW> nightmare on NG is literally sadism
[3:54:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Shoot. The. Ball.
[3:54:32] <%senorpapel> Also i‚Äôm out for the night. See you guys later
[3:54:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Bronze = Normal, Silver = Hard, Gold = Nightmare
[3:54:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "Just play God Hand on Level Die first try 4Head"
[3:54:41] <+KoyoTheBoyo> so streamers can't lie about their difficulty
[3:54:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Are you even a real gamer if you don‚Äôt beat a level on the hardest difficulty right away? Kappa
[3:54:47] <MavMarsh> i guess it's for when you join someone else's game and you need to know what you're in for
[3:54:48] <%Estuko> I want the bug queen lady to step on me
[3:55:00] <Smart_ZaK1> It's like the RE4 smg
[3:55:01] <%king_wragles> good job smg!
[3:55:02] <RiceeFTW> @lewdskeletor13 distortion was running this on Nightmare, I felt so bad for him LMFAO
[3:55:02] <MavMarsh> but i thought pat hated the tmp
[3:55:02] <+Templar15> it's a good smig
[3:55:04] <+Rezca> If only he could say that about the TMP
[3:55:07] <%Wintermute_VRC> what are inside those glowing balls I wonder
[3:55:10] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat This area looks like SOMA and Fallout had a radiation baby.
[3:55:12] <%Mr_Pylon> Pat has become a TMP apologist
[3:55:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I guess shoot the ball in the middle of the room?
[3:55:14] <%Typhaeon> New waifu Sub Machine Girl
[3:55:15] <%rdark_ksu> why have S when can have L?
[3:55:26] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @drfaustisdead That's Quake
[3:55:28] <%BubbaRands> Good Girl SMG
[3:55:39] <%VanaSkiller> Soma monkaS
[3:55:39] <Rashnam> Got to love how goopy this place is
[3:55:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @drfaustisdead you're super right
[3:55:43] <%InugamiTheHound> this MP7 or TMP is doing work
[3:55:47] <%CopperTucker> these environments look great
[3:55:48] <@lewdskeletor13> God Soma gave me anxiety
[3:55:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like SMG, but I prefer LMG. Is there a LMG in this game?
[3:55:54] <RiceeFTW> it's literally just called SMG
[3:55:55] <$drfaustisdead> @Roasted_Pheasant Fair point.
[3:56:01] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan everyone's on gungirls, fgo, ship girls, and I'm on my final fantasy mobile game alone lmao
[3:56:02] <%Wintermute_VRC> maybe they are really big materia
[3:56:09] <Rashnam> All it needs is your feet squelching with every step
[3:56:12] <RiceeFTW> hm I can't recall there being an LMG
[3:56:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Soon there will be moe anthropomorphizations of the SMG (if there aren't already).
[3:56:16] <koffeemancer> Gun girl waifus? What is this, Upotte?
[3:56:19] <Kain5707> @lewdskeletor13 could you kill yourself to keep living
[3:56:25] <+Rezca> Nice switch
[3:56:31] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat in place dodge is a back step and the i-frames can dodge those fucker's swipes and the swing back counter is enough to shut them the fuck down
[3:56:33] <@lewdskeletor13> @kain5707 sipsipHellmo
[3:56:37] <Kain5707> monkaS
[3:56:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YOO! Upotte the shit! My man!
[3:56:39] <blink289> interesting there resistant to flames
[3:56:45] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger there's the Chicago Typewriter which is a tommy gun with a drum mag, soo basically an LMG lol
[3:56:48] <blink289> never tried it on my playthrough
[3:57:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What even IS the beam rifle ammo? Just "long gun" ammo??
[3:57:06] <+Rezca> So... anybody here play Girls Frontline?
[3:57:11] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Pardon
[3:57:13] <RiceeFTW> lol yeah it's "long gun" ammo
[3:57:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW ehh, pistol cartridge but whatevs lol
[3:57:22] <RiceeFTW> just jam this 5.56 ammo into this BEMA RIFLE
[3:57:23] <koffeemancer> Yeye upottes got some waifus lol @King_Wolf_Rigger
[3:57:27] <miabyte> this game is giving me weird RE4 vibes
[3:57:27] <%Typhaeon> Send me to the backline
[3:57:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fuck yeeeeh
[3:57:30] <%Estuko> @residentfunko I like the art, but I cannot get into anothe mobile game :(
[3:57:34] <@lewdskeletor13> Is there a map in this game?
[3:57:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatExcuseMe
[3:57:36] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger technically it's "long gun" in this lol
[3:57:38] <%Estuko> @lewdskeletor13 yes
[3:57:45] <%Calek> there is a map, for dungeons like this it's not useful
[3:57:48] <+LucentWulf> beam rifle is absurdly good throughout the game
[3:57:48] <blink289> did you get the sentry power?
[3:57:48] <Kain5707> if you leave you gotta run this again though
[3:57:48] <MavMarsh> i also like the "art"
[3:57:48] <%Estuko> @lewdskeletor13 top right mini map, + the pause screen has whole map

[3:59:02] <%arcaderabbit48> "I'm lost" well at least you're keeping on brand!
[3:59:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Estuko Don't be consumed by the insects in the mattress
[3:59:03] <Smart_ZaK1> I love how he shit talks after certain kills
[3:59:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW Yeah, I was just kinda hoping for something like an actual LMG. You know, PKM, MG3, something big. But I do love the Thompson.
[3:59:05] <%Calek> can't believe @Estuko has to go to bed now, without dinner even
[3:59:06] <%VanaSkiller> @Estuko schleep
[3:59:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat LOL Why'd you say "Goodnight" to @Estuko ?
[3:59:07] <MavMarsh> oh you'll hear it a lot
[3:59:14] <ItsMarchii> Hey @AngriestPat do you plan on streaming or at least playing WOW classic?
[3:59:18] <%Typhaeon> Now Etsuko, you need your rest to grow into your evolved form, Aggretsuko

[3:59:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 59m.
[3:59:21] <MavMarsh> along with "whoa, it's over"
[3:59:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> He read "Right" as "Night"
[3:59:33] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Does this game have a sweet shotty?
[3:59:33] <MasterDecoder> Nope
[3:59:39] <+GenesisKnight> Anotha one
[3:59:41] <Kain5707> @Estuko night

[3:59:42] <Kain5707> Kappa
[3:59:45] <%king_wragles> IT'S OVER!
[3:59:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Oh you misread "right" as "night"
[3:59:46] <SulfurousAcid> Pat now makes people go to bed
[3:59:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Gobbos ate the word brain
[3:59:53] <miabyte> I think they were saying they were going to BREAD
[3:59:55] <%beetbo2> good night Kappa
[3:59:58] <MavMarsh> he picked up another stand
[3:59:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat sending people to bed early
[4:00:02] <%starotter70> @Estuko Do you know what time it is young lady?
[4:00:06] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah, so far there's not one in the game yet, though implementing it into the game would be as easy as creating a new room and just adding it to the pool for the procedural generation
[4:00:06] <+trackles_64> Use your map
[4:00:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko To bed with you! and no dessert!
[4:00:07] <%SneakTheBeak> apatSleep
[4:00:09] <+Templar15> procgen tiles have a way of doing that
[4:00:14] <%miguelrod777> Pata gonna make you go night night
[4:00:15] <%LiveStreamOnyx> Paige blindness has effected Pat doodWAT
[4:00:16] <%Jp3g95> Daddy Pat OwO
[4:00:22] <%Roasted_Pheasant> stop it you
[4:00:22] <+Rezca> Exits are usually on Level 2, just want to say this now
[4:00:27] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger devs are doing a lot to add to this game and improve, you'll see them stop by on streams often
[4:00:31] <%Keeble24> This area aesthetic reminds me of dead space for some reason
[4:00:32] <%BubbaRands> @Estuko you have school in the morning!
[4:00:40] <blink289> @Estuko well now you have to sleep it has been deemed
[4:00:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW I have noticed that the devs seem keen to keep working on the game, and that's just pushing me harder to get it.
[4:00:54] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan I didn't even get to have my coconut cookies
[4:00:58] <blink289> The walls pat
[4:01:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> He was on the stairs hunched over
[4:01:02] <%Nina96> he walked up
[4:01:02] <+trackles_64> 2nd level above oyu
[4:01:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Yo, those sound good.
[4:01:07] <MavMarsh> oh no
[4:01:09] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger well, no rush to get it. if you're even having some doubts, might as well just wait
[4:01:10] <ECRead> someone with good gacha luck, please, lend me your energy
[4:01:12] <blink289> hit the butt pat
[4:01:13] <RiceeFTW> LUL
[4:01:13] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat what if I told you theres a big version of the SMG that does more damage
[4:01:13] <%Typhaeon> Desinyville
[4:01:13] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger they're amazing
[4:01:15] <%Sklaveritter> Is it me or do enemies kinda spawn in behind you at times?
[4:01:15] <@lewdskeletor13> They‚Äôre coming out of the walls man!
[4:01:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Nina96 and did a forward tilt
[4:01:20] <MavMarsh> out of estus
[4:01:20] <koffeemancer> from the wall remeber
[4:01:22] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Stay down tho
[4:01:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you DROP physical, visible, actual items on the ground? Like trash? (IE can you "mark" where you've been or want to go? Indicators you can control.)
[4:01:23] <%Calek> @PaladinDupre where do I get it
[4:01:24] <Kain5707> theyre plan on coming out with new stuff @King_Wolf_Rigger
[4:01:26] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Whew it's over
[4:01:27] <DSD24> @ECRead I hope you summon who you are wanting
[4:01:28] <%Estuko> @Sklaveritter those specific bastards COME IN FROM THE WALLS
[4:01:31] <miabyte> Bloodwort
[4:01:33] <blink289> RUIN
[4:01:33] <+razzoth> use your health potions
[4:01:34] <Smart_ZaK1> That is a fucking DOOM enemy
[4:01:37] <MavMarsh> he can't get it on this run
[4:01:38] <+griffball13> use a bloodwort
[4:01:47] <blink289> Ruin is boss weapon
[4:01:48] <%Sklaveritter> Oh! T-that's fun!
[4:02:01] <Teyaric> Chicago typewriter
[4:02:02] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat its called the Chicago Typerwriter, its a big weapon, and its found past a locked door after rescuing some idiots outside a dungeon on Earth
[4:02:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW not really having doubts, just looking at what I got, if I can spring for it, you know, trying to be an "adult"
[4:02:05] <blink289> forget which boss gives it to you tho
[4:02:06] <%Estuko> LUL chat you assholes
[4:02:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Ruin is the big gun
[4:02:08] <ECRead> @DSD24 o7
[4:02:10] <+Rezca> He could potentially get it in coop
[4:02:12] <dawnengel> kinda has a bioshock feel to it
[4:02:22] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger lol yeah that's kinda what I meant, if you don't think it's worth the $40 yet, then might as well just wait
[4:02:33] <+Rezca> @Estuko why are you still up?
[4:02:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wait I thought the Chicago Typewriter was in RE4
[4:02:38] <RiceeFTW> Chicago Typewriter is awesome, having 80 BULLETS is insane
[4:02:40] <%Estuko> @Rezca please don't yell at me FeelsBadMan
[4:02:41] <SleepyMaribo> there are some weapons you wont be able to get on this run due to world you were given, it will require a reroll to get everything eventually
[4:02:50] <%arcaderabbit48> This game looks really cool, but if devs are sitll adding things to it then I kinda want to wait to buy it until after all the patches and stuff come out. Is that bad? Am I a bad person for that?
[4:02:54] <Kain5707> @Estuko bed NOW limesHeck
[4:02:54] <%Bt_Robot> Doesn't this totally remind you a a Grineer level?
[4:02:55] <MavMarsh> if you're getting cranky maybe you should sleep
[4:02:55] <RiceeFTW> it'll take more than a few rerolls to get everything
[4:02:59] <%Typhaeon> Pat hate alien symbols
[4:03:01] <@lewdskeletor13> @arcaderabbit48 Nah
[4:03:05] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat 80 bullet magazine, 10 base damage, 30 at full upgrade
[4:03:06] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is Chicago Typewriter not RE4?
[4:03:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Roasted_Pheasant Chicago Typewriter was a common nickname for a tomson Machinegun
[4:03:09] <blink289> wait till the next world pat
[4:03:11] <%miguelrod777> you should go to bed etsuka
[4:03:14] <miabyte> did pat finish FF7 yet? miasZz
[4:03:14] <blink289> its even better
[4:03:16] <%starotter70> Great, now I'm shaping this weird meta where Estuko is the child, Pat's the father and Chat's the mother NotLikeThis
[4:03:19] <+Rezca> @Roasted_Pheasant its in this and RE4
[4:03:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you're missing a lot of the rune things. Can you shoot them? Or use sword?
[4:03:22] <+trackles_64> The one ring?
[4:03:23] <@lewdskeletor13> @miabyte Nope!
[4:03:27] <RiceeFTW> @arcaderabbit48 not really, but it's hard to say how much more content the devs are planning for the game; they could add entire zones, or they could just be adding new items
[4:03:33] <Kain5707> @Estuko limesPat
[4:03:41] <%Jp3g95> Don't yell at Etsuko ruuD
[4:03:44] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Oh I know the reference, just thought we were trolling Pat with fake guns.
[4:03:44] <krymzen5> chest??
[4:03:46] <Smart_ZaK1> Chest
[4:03:47] <%miguelrod777> we are the mother legion
[4:03:49] <%Mr_Pylon> Chest
[4:03:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @RiceeFTW I dont even mean content, I mean stuff like them apparently working on a better map and minimap.
[4:03:58] <%Jp3g95> Spell at her instead
[4:04:00] <krymzen5> ur just blind
[4:04:07] <McAngrimStein> gottem
[4:04:08] <RiceeFTW> @arcaderabbit48 oh, that's quality of life stuff they said they'll fix, but there's other things they need to address
[4:04:10] <@lewdskeletor13> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[4:04:10] <ZeVeegee> they won't in the last world
[4:04:11] <a_mad_dragon> just look better 4Head
[4:04:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW Yeah lol. I do think it's worth the money, but there's always something lurking around the corner to bite me in the ass. Once I'm certain everything's in order, I'll grab it.
[4:04:14] <%Your_heals> why all game gray and brown apatFist apatFist
[4:04:14] <%Nina96> pat they glow yellow
[4:04:14] <%arcaderabbit48> The chests need to glow all of the time
[4:04:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Honestly if it didn't have that shimmer I would have missed like at least 50% of them.
[4:04:16] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Be on the lookout for BFGs
[4:04:17] <@lewdskeletor13> They blend in to fuck you over
[4:04:20] <miabyte> i kinda like this aesthetic, very stargate
[4:04:21] <%SneakTheBeak> apatCanada
[4:04:22] <+Rezca> @Roasted_Pheasant wait... so the Chinese Typewriter doesn't exist?
[4:04:24] <%Typhaeon> Jesus how big is this area
[4:04:28] <%Estuko> @Kain5707 FeelsGoodMan
[4:04:30] <RiceeFTW> @arcaderabbit48 for example, those constructs in this game used to have a RIDICULOUSLY small hitbox for their weakpoint, it was literally 3-4 pixels
[4:04:31] <dawnengel> paiges blindness has rubbed off
[4:04:32] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat dont worry, from now on if you miss a chest the chat will spam this: ( . Y . )
[4:04:32] <Smart_ZaK1> Boss time?
[4:04:35] <%Bt_Robot> Boss room?
[4:04:35] <blink289> wait for the other 3 areas just like it
[4:04:36] <+Templar15> the sneaky chests live on to breed and pass on their boxgenes.
[4:04:39] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Rezca The chinese typewriter is not real. It cant hurt you.
[4:04:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> aww yeah, Pat making big progrees.
[4:04:51] <%blankwaffle> blankwaffle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey thanks for the sick content and dank memes

[4:04:57] <@lewdskeletor13> And now you have done it
[4:04:58] <SulfurousAcid> Is Pat getting all the limit breaks in ff7?
[4:05:00] <RiceeFTW> @King_Wolf_Rigger good plan, I didn't really hesitate on this since I just bought it using CS:GO skins lol but I've put tons of hours onto this for the week it's been out

[4:05:10] <%Calek> oh this boss is neato
[4:05:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @RiceeFTW Ooooh, that is bad. I'm glad they fixed that, but it does kinda highlight my "maybe give this game a few months first" idea. Im not very good at shooters to begin with
[4:05:11] <Rashnam> haven't fought this boss yet
[4:05:11] <Kain5707> oh boy

[4:05:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW lol, CS skins, that's genuinely awesome.
[4:05:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Check out the claw marks on the center stones!
[4:05:34] <Zebroneath> I don't like the look of this arena
[4:05:34] <koffeemancer> Guys stop with the chinese typewriter already Dx
[4:05:36] <RiceeFTW> @arcaderabbit48 well, the patches so far have been great; there was a softlock issue with the final boss before, that has also been patched
[4:05:36] <MavMarsh> there's one that isn't a wave boss
[4:05:40] <Smart_ZaK1> Shadow puzzle boss
[4:05:45] <$AgentTexes> This game looks pretty boring.

[4:09:19] <%SneakTheBeak> apatHat
[4:09:21] <SpaceGuntank> he keeps trying to trade with the boss, someone needs to remind pat that he's not big
[4:09:28] <AmericanaRed> PICK UP THE SOULS
[4:09:33] <+Rezca> Adds are for 1. Annoyance and 2. Ammo pick ups
[4:09:34] <otaku9392> for ammo
[4:09:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 what does pot of greed do?
[4:09:38] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Clipped

[4:09:52] <pennykettle_> I haven't seen too much of this game but all the bosses seem lazily designed
[4:09:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Shatter? Buddy?

[4:12:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Shatter? More like Shitter. apatDab
[4:12:01] <%Bt_Robot> It's like Ornstein and Smough. The one you kill last gives you their weapon
[4:12:02] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat wonder if you get a different item based on who you kill last.
[4:12:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat YOu did a real good job making it bug out

[4:18:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> glom
[4:18:42] <Rashnam> the key for the golem doesn't spawn on every run
[4:18:43] <RiceeFTW> you get set bonuses just for having 1 piece
[4:18:49] <RiceeFTW> that's why it's alright to mix/match
[4:18:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Roasted_Pheasant You have no honour sir! Un-honourable!
[4:18:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't you need the full set for the bonus to activate?
[4:18:57] <RiceeFTW> nope
[4:18:59] <%Estuko> @starotter70 apatWhat pls
[4:19:05] <RiceeFTW> there's set bonuses for 1 piece, 2 pieces and 3
[4:19:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> You dont need the full set to get a partial bonus
[4:19:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> that dog wanted some
[4:19:17] <blink289> that is a terrible spawn
[4:19:17] <puse9> nice! pat got the beam rifle!
[4:19:17] <%starotter70> Alright Chat, lets sing @Estuko to sleep
[4:19:18] <ChoculaUltra> ya know those checkpoints kinda sound like the Hypno Toad.
[4:19:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat nevermind I don't know what I'm saying. I presumed set bonus was from a full set.
[4:19:25] <42nfl19> why call it a set bonus if you don't even have a set lol. Just call it a passive.
[4:19:28] <krymzen5> set bonuses have tiers chat, so 2 pieces are better than 1 but not as good as 3
[4:19:32] <%Estuko> @starotter70 apatWhat apatWhat

[4:20:37] <RiceeFTW> @forevermasterless depends on the difficulty, I've needed to use a few on Hard
[4:20:38] <Rashnam> somewhat
[4:20:38] <CertainlyNotTheFireNation> the starting armor can help with that

[4:25:16] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestAngryArtist items except long gun ammo are all shared
[4:25:17] <+nekodelic> I love that you can crit boxes in this game
[4:25:18] <Khorneflakes_> It's a good idea in the long run
[4:25:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Boxes have structural weakpoints
[4:25:21] <+GenesisKnight> Money and XP are never bad investments
[4:25:21] <%Laecerelius> Pat has elder maxed
[4:25:21] <Smart_ZaK1> You need that Mr Krabs money

[4:25:56] <%Roasted_Pheasant> One of them was still alive pat
[4:25:59] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestAngryArtist no, actually as far as I know the co-op doesn't even scale the item drops, so it drops the same as on single
[4:26:02] <%Calek> it's neat but I don't think it's "take up one of two slots" neat
[4:26:06] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, so... apparently I missed more than I thought taking that shower, the hell was the stasis bubble?
[4:26:09] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestAngryArtist devs have said they're planning on tuning it though
[4:26:09] <%Estuko> @Roasted_Pheasant I wanna see if it eventually bites his butt

[4:28:48] <koffeemancer> The fun beam wouldve made this world a whole lot easier
[4:28:51] <krymzen5> ps3 had some good exclusives
[4:29:01] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW I remember all my friends skipped school for Halo 3 launch FeelsBadMan then I got surprised with the collector's edition, now I got to be the baddest bitch lmao
[4:29:01] <Ion_Laser> My ps3 has lasted for 11 years, my 360 shit the bed twice within 6 years
[4:29:04] <RiceeFTW> ah yes, key word here is "some" LUL
[4:29:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Remember "PS3 has no games"?
[4:29:10] <Smart_ZaK1> This just seems mean lmao
[4:29:25] <%Estuko> @Ion_Laser my ps3 still lives lmao, I had to repair my xbox360 like 4 times before it finally died :(
[4:29:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "Let's make our system architecture so arcane that it's a total chore to program for, and impossible to port from. THAT'LL motivate devs to program games for our system!"-- Sony 2006
[4:29:30] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko Halo 3 was one of the best experiences of that console era ever
[4:29:32] <Jeemukun> the new helmet and laser gun keep making me think of skitarii
[4:29:44] <Run44forrest> is this a warframe ?
[4:29:45] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @AncelDeLambert AND THEN MOTION CONTROLS
[4:29:46] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW It was god-like. I also enjoyed ODST as well
[4:29:52] <RiceeFTW> I used to repair red rings of death for $50 each hggWoke
[4:29:53] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, radiation laser guns are very skitarii

[4:30:08] <%AncelDeLambert> NINTENDO IS DOING MOTION CONTROLS WE NEED TO DO MOTION CONTROLS now put the minimum effort into it, engineers!
[4:30:12] <Ion_Laser> @Estuko That sucks. After my 360 got the RROD the second time I stuck with the ps3
[4:30:21] <%Roasted_Pheasant> GOTTA KILL LAIR
[4:30:22] <koffeemancer> @senorpapel The what now?
[4:30:28] <RiceeFTW> ODST and Reach were great; so interesting seeing the Halo universe from a different perspective than the god Master Chief
[4:30:31] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW I went to a friend's house who carried his 360, caught him out back dunking a gallon of water out of it, bring it back inside to dry and then we played halo together on it. It never hit me till years later.
[4:30:31] <%Roasted_Pheasant> LAIR THE HALO KILLER
[4:30:32] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @senorpapel the WHAT doodWAT

[4:30:59] <%Estuko> @starotter70 Reach is exceptional, but the other games are great experiences themselves
[4:31:17] <%Roasted_Pheasant> He wuvs you
[4:31:20] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko lol yeah, red rings were mainly just overheating; all I had to do was remove the heatsink, clean out the thermal paste, apply new one (we got tons of them for free at my high school's tech department) and it worked all great
[4:31:21] <majindusto> I still have LAIR...only played 10 minutes of it BibleThump
