[0:09:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Gobo died off screen
[0:09:05] <$MrWurmles> congratz, I stopped Kingmaker during the kingdom phase of the game and never got back to it.
[0:09:05] <Rozalyndis> it's fantastic when you're not a bit player
[0:09:06] <%Shonen_hero> That final level SUCKS
[0:09:06] <%StephanieSadGirl> The Egg is looking significantly LESS Fleshy today!
[0:09:13] <jman13131313> yes
[0:09:15] <@Ranryu692> @ChrisPlaysThing I'm working on it already, thank you lol
[0:09:19] <%Shonen_hero> but the ending after that is real good
[0:09:19] <%Buttlo> The Pathfinder games are great.
[0:09:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> EWW, limp bizkit NFTs
[0:09:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> true ending

[0:09:33] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Is it, not great?
[0:09:35] <+Catpurnicus> lol why do these games always faceplant the ending
[0:09:37] <%StephanieSadGirl> @ChrisPlaysThing Great, I needed to taste bile today
[0:09:39] <+Catpurnicus> ALWAYS
[0:09:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> I fucking love this game and have been playing it with my bf.

[0:09:59] <yukichocomilk> @ChrisPlaysThing LMAO
[0:10:16] <DXLelouch24> So skip to Righteous?
[0:10:22] <%hairtoday> even without the difficulty it's still a chore
[0:10:22] <@Ranryu692> can BG3 just hit 1.0 already
[0:10:30] <%Shonen_hero> no play Kingmaker
[0:10:33] <ExpressNode> You love it tho
[0:10:46] <mrethanclifford> hey pat, just curious if you are checking out windjammers 2? if you were into windjammers
[0:10:49] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What?
[0:10:59] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How could it be that bad?
[0:11:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you mod it for unlimited time and custom item crafting, I bet you can cut that difficulty down, but you'd be steamrolling everything else.
[0:11:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I can't stop noticing your double chin there, Pat. that beard better come back quick.
[0:11:13] <%solracc25> terrible as in what? bad lv design?

[0:13:53] <+jeanclaudejunkeh> that's harsh
[0:13:53] <EynoStiles> the goblin, huh?
[0:13:55] <%AyotoCorp> Yeah the Wrath ending is way better
[0:13:57] <DianaTheAscian> bruh why is it like that
[0:14:07] <%cartakus> Perma death of companions dragon age
[0:14:25] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, you really need to play an actual TTRPG with a good DM that can actually tailor the game to what you want, isntead of hoping these CRPGs wont be just trash at the end
[0:14:27] <DianaTheAscian> I'm fine with Victory laps
[0:14:32] <%MrWurmles> Does it even make sense that the companion is off'ed without your ability to affect it?
[0:14:35] <%crimsonharvest> Arcanum's was pretty satisfying, they let you go crazy engineering your own solutions
[0:14:36] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt is it bad enough to make the game not worth playing?
[0:14:46] <+Catpurnicus> do any classic WRPGs end well?
[0:14:46] <penitentpendant> Another RPG that trips at the finish line
[0:15:06] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Play up to that point and then look up the rest?
[0:15:17] <+sasparillatango> I remember getting to 1 fight I was stuck on for an hour and I just gave up -- came back when WOTR came out to just polish it off
[0:15:19] <ExpressNode> So you enjoyed most of it then?
[0:15:20] <%TheREALGirthMan> psaBig math time
[0:15:32] <Profmcstevie> A smooth ride with a fucking SLEDGEHAMMER at the final stop
[0:15:32] <Vashido22> hey thats alright
[0:15:36] <MidnightPacif1c> coxBut
[0:15:36] <MyNameIsRasus> quick maffs
[0:15:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> so it's the ME3 of CRPG's?
[0:16:03] <SaltyAzteca> @Logoth_ Hey AM HeyGuys
[0:16:06] <@Ranryu692> what was a shittier time last night, the end of Kingmaker or watching Valiant?
[0:16:09] <DXLelouch24> Is there a mod to make the ending not a fuck? There usually is
[0:16:11] <%BigCoffee> even on baby easy mode?
[0:16:16] <MyNameIsRasus> house at the edge of time is a sick name tho
[0:16:23] <%pectusumbra> *nod* that's my experience with Monster Sanctuary. Back in the original patch, had fun with everything but the LAST BOSS
[0:16:34] <%Shonen_hero> 98% of the game is worth playing, it's not like Mass Effect 3, almost all of it is good except the end dungeon. And the endings for the narrative stuff in Kingmaker is great
[0:16:42] <$KishinGrek> Just like BioShock
[0:16:44] <+sasparillatango> lose all your characters and every fight is absurdly hard
[0:16:45] <kikoeru_san> it's bad balance vs bad storytelling
[0:16:50] <MyNameIsRasus> was a king made?
[0:16:55] <Profmcstevie> Making a good finish is not easy, and BOY will the audience feel it if you fuck it up
[0:16:59] <%Shonen_hero> I knew it
[0:17:00] <+sasparillatango> like, there are characters that have AOE death auras
[0:17:07] <%BigCoffee> Yes
[0:17:11] <%Shonen_hero> ;-;
[0:17:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> I would
[0:17:13] <+sasparillatango> I WOULD WATCH IT

[0:17:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> how dare you even be 4 minutes late. so unprofessional. :P
[0:17:36] <%MrWurmles> To compare it to ME3 would be like saying ME3's ending was good, everything on earth including fighting and companion interactions was terrible and unenjoyable because they decided to change how the game works upon landing on earth.

[0:20:44] <~PatStaresAt> https://twitter.com/PatStaresAt/status/1484683663551909897?s=20
[0:20:46] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> RAGING_1NF3RNO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey there, GrEggStaresAt. I just took a work from home position at my job. I can finally get away from these maskless idiots. Woo!
[0:20:46] <@Ranryu692> I can't wait to vote against Dark Souls
[0:20:53] <%Shonen_hero> Vote them off the island
[0:21:01] <%optimasmaximas> peachjars do be cool tho
[0:21:04] <@Ranryu692> oh god dammit, I can't vote in a twitter poll
[0:21:08] <+theoldone001> Is Paige as gross as she claims to be or even worse?
[0:21:11] <+kylejefferies> what's the question?
[0:21:15] <robosqueeb> what a Sophie's choice
[0:21:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> i participated in democracy
[0:21:16] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt hey pat, did you beat curse of the moon 1's nightmare mode off stream?
[0:21:17] <@Ranryu692> I don't have an account anymore lol
[0:21:18] <+Mrbaconator> pat there's a different between wanting it in general and choosing it over a stream with paige and plague in it @PatStaresAt
[0:21:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:21:19] <DXLelouch24> Hey thats not Nightfall
[0:21:23] <Treasure_Vault> I would watch 20 minutes of it. Those games aren't stream games.
[0:21:23] <+BlackSunEmperor> I want both tho
[0:21:26] <%cartakus> Will plague and paige play wrath?
[0:21:30] <%MelBrooksKA> Wait, why did you make a twitter poll?
[0:21:31] <Vashido22> you should! its great
[0:21:32] <%bravebravesrobin> but Twitter is toxic af
[0:21:36] <@PeachSaliva> I can’t believe you don’t wanna play with me and Plague. WOW.
[0:21:36] <Vashido22> its pretty much the other part of the game
[0:21:39] <%cartakus> Duh huh
[0:21:39] <Rozalyndis> i've super cleared curse of the moon 1 and 2
[0:21:40] <%MelBrooksKA> You can do polls in here
[0:21:43] <Rozalyndis> because i'm stupid
[0:21:44] <@PeachSaliva> I am hurt, deeply and truly.
[0:21:44] <SaltyAzteca> Nightmare is feckin hard but its pretty sick
[0:21:45] <%RealThiele> social media was a mistake
[0:21:49] <Rozalyndis> HI PAIGE!!! andyLove
[0:21:49] <%pectusumbra> hmmm. I'd be interested, but not in place of Rise. Also tomorrow I work until 4 anyway
[0:21:51] <%optimasmaximas> Wtf is nightfall
[0:21:52] <%notsoy> i would like to watch you give wrath a second go, but i want to watch monster hunter with the gang more
[0:21:53] <Balabalalde> Is WoTR better since release? It was a pretty rough launch with bugs and crashes.
[0:21:53] <%TerpanderLux> thats a good mode too
[0:21:54] <@PeachSaliva> I will also be offended on Plague’s behalf.
[0:21:57] <%JoshManVGH> Monstie Hunty with Hammy Wifey vote now!
[0:22:00] <Vashido22> nightmare gets you the actual ending
[0:22:02] <%StephanieSadGirl> Leave those monsters alone, they were there first, go pathfinder instead
[0:22:05] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva because he's scared
[0:22:07] <@GeneralSCPatton> For a brief moment, I was the only vote, and then the MonHunners attacked.
[0:22:08] <Profmcstevie> is it nightmare mode that has the secret boss? I forget
[0:22:09] <+Mrbaconator> @PeachSaliva i do want pathfinder but i also chose you over it
[0:22:17] <+kylejefferies> I'm voting for Monster Hunter just for the Paige comedic value.
[0:22:18] <OkamiDude15> nightmare mode is a seperate campaign iirc
[0:22:22] <%mister___doctor> But what about Sicko Mode, Pat!?!?
[0:22:23] <%RealThiele> the ending of curse of the moon 2 is wild
[0:22:25] <%PocketBearIllustrator> voted for monsters
[0:22:27] <ammobasket> NEXT GAME mode
[0:22:28] <Vashido22> yeah nightmare has the true final boss
[0:22:32] <SaltyAzteca> How many people voted?
[0:22:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> people like monsters
[0:22:35] <%TheREALGirthMan> Monsters are super cool we love hunting htem
[0:22:40] <+Mrbaconator> that's because the other option is just better
[0:22:41] <%TerpanderLux> i would watch monster hunter :)
[0:22:43] <%cartakus> Yay
[0:22:45] <%StephanieSadGirl> Leave the monsters alone!
[0:22:45] <Profmcstevie> You have 2 GUESTS ON MONSTER HUNTER
[0:22:47] <%Logoth_> Working on it as we speak
[0:22:48] <whimwhisp> I want to play WoR on my own ;p
[0:22:49] <+Catpurnicus> We are in the Pag/Gret stage of beard
[0:22:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> grow it faster
[0:22:53] <olm46> Grow it faster!
[0:22:53] <+mikesapartment> do mutton chops next
[0:22:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Will Pat give his character the biggest boobs because if he doesn't its not worth it
[0:22:53] <Profmcstevie> that's cheating, we vote for paige and plague
[0:22:54] <whimwhisp> and you guys hanging out together is cute
[0:22:55] <@Ranryu692> one option has Paige and Eli, one doesn't, it was never a fair fight lol
[0:22:57] <+izanagi22> In fairness I think people would watch it but prefer MonHun
[0:22:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Just push the hair out of your face
[0:22:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> would 100% not watch monsters
[0:23:00] <+theoldone001> Just put some ROgaine on it to make it come back faster
[0:23:00] <%pectusumbra> I mean I'd watch it but It's vs. Paige. Just do it another day
[0:23:01] <%strakillias> Do a poll for a day that doesn't have the promise of PPP time as the other option.
[0:23:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Beardless Pat is a problem
[0:23:03] <+DiscouragedOblong> I can't stop thinking he looks like Rich Evans
[0:23:03] <%TheREALGirthMan> Greg Looks At
[0:23:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> I'm now tempted to rebinge the Pillars 1 VODs
[0:23:04] <tigerfang86> its him, GREG LOOKS AT
[0:23:05] <Not_Paladin> hi greg
[0:23:06] <valstriam> I would watch it but MonHun is just too good with Peach and Plague
[0:23:09] <%optimasmaximas> peach and plague are better content
[0:23:10] <yukichocomilk> greg is the new host of patstaresat
[0:23:10] <%cartakus> Fuck the monsters.....Eli
[0:23:11] <SaltyAzteca> Gregwatchesthe Kappa

[0:23:12] <+Mrbaconator> @Ranryu692 this
[0:23:17] <TEAMATTACK13> this is the Greg arc
[0:23:17] <tigerfang86> GregLooksAt is my favoritestreamer
[0:23:19] <%SaiyanShoto> I like this Greg guy
[0:23:20] <EynoStiles> Pats enraged state
[0:23:21] <%TerpanderLux> warrior cool
[0:23:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Greg Glares At
[0:23:26] <Dova573> Greg sucks, he looks like someone who would ask for the managaer
[0:23:29] <%RealThiele> gregg
[0:23:29] <%JoshManVGH> WAR never dies. Like, ever.
[0:23:30] <domvito1234> yo! you have a new favorite monster from rise? im a huge fan of Goss
[0:23:33] <+Catpurnicus> Greg UnderLooks
[0:23:36] <Dova573> Pat is cooler
[0:23:43] <+ValkahRoctsteel> Wrath would be cool to watch but it cant compete with Monster Hunter
[0:23:51] <+Brebovr> Mos the classes are good you can pick mostly whatever
[0:23:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> bring back Pat
[0:24:06] <TallYoda08> danHi
[0:24:12] <%cartakus> And them Dark got stomped
[0:24:13] <EynoStiles> Greg looks like he doesnt bully children, bring the other guy back!
[0:24:16] <SaltyAzteca> OH HE DID DIE
[0:24:19] <SaltyAzteca> AWW
[0:24:20] <%Logoth_> Meatloaf and Louie Anderson
[0:24:24] <%TerpanderLux> we werent meant to know what That was
[0:24:25] <TallYoda08> atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:24:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Now Plague joins the hunt
[0:24:28] <%TheREALGirthMan> F
[0:24:34] <Profmcstevie> I will watch the beginning of pick of destiny on loop
[0:24:34] <+theoldone001> Apparently he died of Covid according to TMZ.
[0:24:37] <Profmcstevie> RIP Meatloaf
[0:24:44] <%JoshManVGH> Like a bat out of hell he WAS gone when the morning came...
[0:24:46] <%Logoth_> wat
[0:24:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I've got a wildman beard going on, i'm planning a bit, for when i go back to the office one day and just look like a hermit leaving his cave after a decade
[0:24:46] <scrumbotime> God I still throw on Bat out of Hell and Bat out of Hell 2: Back into Hell every once in a while to get powerblasted with rock opera
[0:24:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Meat Loaf remains un-controlled
[0:24:52] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The Bat outta hell is now an angle in hebben
[0:24:53] <+Mrbaconator> fuck 5th edition pathfinder forever
[0:24:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Wait 8 is for nurgle tho. Or was it 7
[0:25:01] <+Kyma1020> Solasta
[0:25:01] <+kylejefferies> Ballers Gate 3
[0:25:06] <%StephanieSadGirl> Baldurs Gate 3 is NOT 5e dnd, it is a bastardization
[0:25:07] <+Kyma1020> uses SRD
[0:25:14] <%MrWurmles> Solasta and BG3 are the only ones so far.
[0:25:18] <EynoStiles> @theoldone001 Yeah, but TMZ is a bunch of arseholes. so bag of salt and all that
[0:25:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's a shame that the licensing will never bring back 3.5 edition, but at least we have PF
[0:25:30] <%StephanieSadGirl> Uses the SRD with a giant asterisk after it, that it is changes how most 5e combat works
[0:25:31] <+Kyma1020> and BG3 is in early access and it's getting better with its implementation
[0:25:45] <%VioletHeart> BG3 is SUPER 5e.
[0:25:46] <+Catpurnicus> yeah 5th edition was too jank for it lol
[0:25:48] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Baldur memes 3
[0:25:57] <+Catpurnicus> it doesn't work for non-tabletop
[0:25:57] <Profmcstevie> BG3 is learning how to make a video game live
[0:25:59] <%MrWurmles> BG3 is still in early access and Solasta is on the verge of being great.
[0:26:03] <+kylejefferies> Every PC d20 system is going to be a bastardization due to scope and scale
[0:26:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oat misses Thac0
[0:26:06] <thatdudenamedlogan> Converting the engine to a completely different ruleset  I imagine was nightmarish
[0:26:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[0:26:13] <+gheremy84> D&D just doesn't translate perfectly to video games
[0:26:16] <%mister___doctor> The answer is that that RPGs stink and RPG fans smell like Stink
[0:26:19] <TheeRabbi> Solasta needs edge panning so badly lol
[0:26:20] <%StephanieSadGirl> It did get obsessed with some stuff, but then other stuff like the weird aoe and effect stuff on low level enemies, and Larian's obsession with physics based stuff makes it really weird
[0:26:25] <Rozalyndis> celeste?
[0:26:27] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I'd watch
[0:26:27] <%barrakuta371> Is Solasta a drug or a pasta?
[0:26:31] <Rozalyndis> oh, never mind
[0:26:34] <%Shonen_hero> Solasta
[0:26:36] <%zeroarturia> also in the message I was glad Paige  was into monster hunter
[0:26:39] <Profmcstevie> Solasta aahh spaghetti
[0:26:41] <whimwhisp> It's turn based yes
[0:26:41] <+TopTieramisu> spider-paige?
[0:26:44] <whimwhisp> and on a grid
[0:26:47] <+Kyma1020> I mean that's kinda 5e?
[0:26:47] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> That sounds dope af
[0:26:53] <scrumbotime> Solasta is EVEN MORE ACCURATE
[0:26:54] <%StephanieSadGirl> Thats what Larian games are though.
[0:26:55] <+Catpurnicus> D&D always requires fudging rolls by the DM so the party doesn't wipe
[0:26:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> A bunch of words
[0:26:57] <%Shonen_hero> It's pretty great
[0:26:59] <+kylejefferies> like Total War?
[0:27:00] <whimwhisp> there is a campaign yes
[0:27:02] <%MrWurmles> Solasta is turn-based like Divinity original sin.
[0:27:02] <+Kyma1020> There's a "story"
[0:27:04] <%Stan4Apples> The battling is fun. That's it
[0:27:05] <%MrWurmles> Yes.
[0:27:10] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months, currently on a 61 month streak! 
[0:27:10] <%Stan4Apples> There is a campaign, but it blows
[0:27:12] <sirrice77> yes there's a campaign, it's also made on a budget

[0:27:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[0:27:23] <%Rozalyndis> kelpGasp
[0:27:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Catpurnicus That is a controversal statement, but alot of the times yes.  The DM has to be a real person inorder to keep stuff flowing, its why Crpgs are so FUCKING HARD at times.
[0:27:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> War of the Lions
[0:27:34] <TheeRabbi> Imagine trying to play Original Sin WITHOUT edge panning. That's the uselessness of Solasta
[0:27:35] <%Rozalyndis> THAAANK YOU FARFEEETCHED sakuLove limesHug
[0:27:37] <+kylejefferies> Hearing it described like that made me think of Total War.
[0:27:40] <%JoshManVGH> Oh it uses the SRD.
[0:27:48] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, you probably have, but have youn played Tyrany?
[0:27:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis You're welcome! Always nice to see you in here geefSmush geefChicken

[0:28:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The only thing I remember about tyranny is MemesInShadow. Also good ending yay
[0:28:34] <%barrakuta371> Very good friends I hope psaBougie
[0:28:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now that's what I call the Wrath of the Righteous
[0:28:35] <$realm_forge> Consult your doctor before taking Solasta. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, and exploding duck farts.
[0:28:36] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Do you have any intention of playing any of the older Final fantasy games?
[0:28:42] <%MrWurmles> It's entirely turn-based in combat. Including movement limitations per turn. And the action economy of 5e. So a bit like how BG3 is being structured now.

[0:33:39] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> gotcha thx guys
[0:33:42] <@QueequegTheater> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Think of Divinity: Original Sin 2
[0:33:48] <%BigCoffee> Did Pat do a full pillars playtrough?
[0:33:52] <%TerpanderLux> moon2N
[0:33:54] <Profmcstevie> CRPG is RPG before video game specific RPG was made, Computer RPG. It's tabletop concepts put to video game
[0:34:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh ive playdes DOS2
[0:34:03] <%Logoth_> 300 people showed up

[0:34:15] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The decision to shave the bird did not come from you did it Pat?
[0:34:18] <@GeneralSCPatton> I vaguely remember my VOD binge for that
[0:34:24] <EynoStiles> @optimasmaximas he mention on wenesday stream
[0:34:25] <@QueequegTheater> @SaltkeyAndAckfish That's a CRPG
[0:34:26] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[0:34:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Your voice was giving out
[0:34:30] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> No one wants to read
[0:34:31] <yukichocomilk> @Profmcstevie what a stupid name for a genre
[0:34:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah the bird
[0:34:35] <ToneBacas> how much again?
[0:34:36] <+moonyshines> CRPG's are just books
[0:34:40] <%JustToWatch> Thank god Disco Elysium fixed that
[0:34:41] <%strakillias> Hopefully Disco sets a new standard in that regard
[0:34:47] <@ssjklyco> Not gonna lie, it felt weird not getting any Mass effect after it ended.
[0:34:50] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> so replay disco elysium :)
[0:34:51] <@QueequegTheater> Just summarize it
[0:34:55] <TheTakkster> Good thing divinity OS2 is fully voice acted
[0:34:55] <vonmaultke> There is something bland about Pillar of eternity's world and I can't quite place. Art direction maybe?
[0:34:59] <Profmcstevie> I CAN READ IT
[0:35:00] <%barrakuta371> Hire A VA
[0:35:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NO U
[0:35:02] <fistynopunches> Disco getting full voice acting was amazing
[0:35:03] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:35:04] <%CalderGaming> mods VA??
[0:35:05] <%StephanieSadGirl> @strakillias Seriously, and Disco has SO MUCH more text then most crpgs
[0:35:06] <%mister___doctor> Remember that fucking time you tried to stream Fallout New Vegas and got the authentic experience of the game not working
[0:35:12] <+CursedNobleman> wooo! cotm 2!
[0:35:12] <@QueequegTheater> Have Paige read it for the content
[0:35:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> Summarizing takes extra mental effort
[0:35:18] <TheeRabbi> You should check out Gamedec. It feels like a spiritual successor to Shadowrun Returns. It is a lot of fun
[0:35:20] <+silvery_cricket> Get a text to speech mod
[0:35:22] <%TheREALGirthMan> Father is cruel. Father will not let Elmo on the couch
[0:35:23] <Profmcstevie> Learn to cliffnotes a paragraph of text, like school trained you for
[0:35:26] <%RealThiele> paiges voice will die faster than his

[0:38:18] <+CursedNobleman> naw, hes just soma cruz
[0:38:19] <@GeneralSCPatton> That feels like a spoiler, because it's a bit of a pop off when they show up
[0:38:24] <ExpressNode> His reach is short
[0:38:25] <%Cynical2DD> With the advent of Pat shaving hi beard, I did as well and wow. Facial hair makes some men more attractive then they deserve
[0:38:28] <%InternetShis> Is it an invalidator sequel?
[0:38:33] <MidnightPacif1c> coxJam
[0:38:33] <+AudacityESQ> Wait who is that playing? Pat’s younger, more handsome brother?
[0:38:35] <Profmcstevie> Speed over range
[0:38:40] <%Mendin> Castlevania 3 says hello
[0:38:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> I forgot the trailer
[0:38:42] <%Jerp> also makes for a pretty decent tank
[0:38:45] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre in the trailer and on steam @GeneralSCPatton
[0:38:52] <%RealThiele> decent sub weapons tho
[0:38:53] <Treasure_Vault> It's a spoiler that the only characters in this series are in this series
[0:38:53] <Profmcstevie> Good old japanese trailers SPOILING
[0:38:54] <%Rozalyndis> i never watch trailers
[0:38:58] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Neve watch a trailer for a game you like as it will always contain spoilers
[0:38:59] <OkamiDude15> need time stop to get there
[0:39:01] <%Rozalyndis> they contain spoilers. case in point
[0:39:04] <+CursedNobleman> zangetsu gets way better one the thingie happens
[0:39:06] <+Catpurnicus> its kinda the entire draw of these games that you switch between characters
[0:39:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> Look, I bought and then immediately played without looking at the media
[0:39:12] <+Catpurnicus> ala castlevania 3
[0:39:13] <%Jerp> in the first game it was like, if I know I had to take damage, "ok zangetsu throw your face over there real quick"
[0:39:13] <%Thraximunday> Thraximunday subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! thts a lot of months
[0:39:14] <@ssjklyco> Fact Checking will ruin the chat complaints
[0:39:19] <KnivesEve> i love 4

[0:39:38] <%TheREALGirthMan> We Castle Gaiden now
[0:39:42] <%Logoth_> Inti creates make good NESlike games
[0:39:44] <SomersaultJustice> castlevania starts at castlevania 1
[0:39:46] <%RealThiele> holy water on death blew my mind as a kid
[0:39:46] <%Rozalyndis> you should see the speedruns of castlevanias 1-3
[0:39:48] <Profmcstevie> Perhaps only underrated due to the series drying up
[0:39:48] <%Rozalyndis> they're wild
[0:39:49] <Tracazoid> Castlevania 3 is my second favourite, including all the Metroidvania games. 1 is also fantastic.
[0:39:50] <%Jerp> ritual's getting a sequel though, isn't it? zeroarturia ?
[0:39:52] <%pectusumbra> they did announce they were starting on a ritual 2
[0:39:52] <%optimasmaximas> @zeroarturia got confirmed a while ago
[0:39:53] <+Catpurnicus> damn thats a long blood message
[0:39:54] <%Cynical2DD> What arer you Greg? Old or something?
[0:39:57] <%Mendin> We got those Ninja Gaiden tribtues a few yeears back which were p good to
[0:39:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> LOL the donation dancing pat on the screen was right on the platform, looked like a monster chasing pat's char
[0:40:20] <%Jerp> I hope they can justify cotm3 as well
[0:40:23] <Profmcstevie> Inticreates got the second luminous avenger coming out this month, hope it too is sick
[0:40:34] <gunstars20> Directional whip too strong
[0:40:37] <%MrWurmles> Yeah Arin Hanson did a video on that.
[0:40:38] <%zeroarturia> Were they like Woolie with his SOTN is where Castlevania starts
[0:40:46] <+sonofthedeepsouth> But Pat. Woolie said castlevania belongs at SOTN. There isnt a castlevania 1 Kappa
[0:40:50] <%Thraximunday> Analog stick whip when
[0:40:51] <%RealThiele> castlevania 4 is still amazing to play
[0:40:57] <%Mendin> Akumajou Draculax

[1:04:11] <BYAKURENLOVER763> and he's bald
[1:04:11] <+CursedNobleman> @StephanieSadGirl but hes green and distrusts the church NotLikeThis
[1:04:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> In co-op, Robert can still hit most enemies with prone shots while riding on the other player's head
[1:04:21] <+Catpurnicus> he can wall climb

[1:05:43] <%RealThiele> theres a lot of breakable looking but non-breakable floors
[1:05:52] <+CursedNobleman> this game is designed with replayability, dont overthink it your first run
[1:05:59] <spikeymike> he has my favorite weapon skill though
[1:05:59] <%Agami23> when you think about it, a gun is just really long range blunt damage. so skeletons should die fast to them
[1:06:02] <OkamiDude15> you need time stop to get past them
[1:06:13] <SaltyAzteca> We jonkin
[1:06:15] <%notsoy> what did gief do this time

[1:07:52] <+Dives__> Gief the thief
[1:07:58] <%Jerp> isn't Gief like 50% ham by volume though?
[1:07:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> @saltmeisterr My headcanon for my favorite strat is that Rob is actually perched on Dominique's massive mommy milkers for his mobile sniper nest.

[1:56:38] <+TopTieramisu> and castlevania 64 isn't exactly known as a great game
[1:56:50] <+TopTieramisu> mo. dern.
[1:56:51] <%Rozalyndis> true enough
[1:57:04] <%Rozalyndis> I DUNNO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU
[1:57:58] <%MrWurmles> Lords of Shadow 2 came out in February 25, 2014
[1:58:20] <Blank9> Castlevania Adventure Rebirth for wii is legit good classic Castlevania
[1:58:25] <+TopTieramisu> i think we can all agree bloodborne is definitely superior in the comparison
[1:58:34] <%Rozalyndis> well duh
[1:58:59] <%Rozalyndis> bloodborne is a masterpiece
[1:59:09] <Blank9> also the music is so good in it

[1:59:45] <MaybeFalco> poo is a natural debuff

[1:59:51] <+AlucardX60> In your butt or in your pants?
[2:00:04] <Lizardsphere> correct
[2:00:05] <Blank9> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense Sadly yeah, pretty easy to handle in other ways at least.

[2:01:31] <%Infernal_Dalek> Truly, a treasure
[2:01:42] <%Rozalyndis> this game's the old school difficulty where you really had to memorize the boss patterns
[2:01:44] <%Jerp> this boss was such a big difficulty leap until I got used to the pattern
[2:02:02] <%StephanieSadGirl> The mobot never says the best part about being in the sub only discord server, which is being able to plaster Elmo and Gief's faces in every OTHER discord server, since its nitro boosted

[2:11:31] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, just popping in to say that I got Jeff Gerstmann to play the anime UNO game on UPF today
[2:11:38] <+AgniBrandt> Hard agree on Pillars
[2:11:39] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat same advice I gave
[2:11:42] <Treasure_Vault> Divinity 2 was pretty neat. I got to the same point everyone stops, so that kind of counts as finishing it.
[2:11:45] <%Puhff> Crpgdeez nuts psaDab
[2:11:49] <%AgniBrandt> Those games are great. Pillars 2 especially
[2:11:57] <+KingKrampus> yo just got in,  how many times had Pat called this Castlevania?
[2:11:57] <%za7az> Planescape torment is on sale for 80% off on switch rn btw

[2:12:02] <%PatNTheHat> Divinity OS 1 SUCKS ASS
[2:12:12] <%PatNTheHat> IT FUCKING SUCKS
[2:12:17] <%luftraumm1> divinity is crazy
[2:12:25] <Frankenshop> Divinity Original Sin 1 ruined that genre for me, really bad first pick
[2:12:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> Personally, I hate the Larian games, they always feel so edgelord and grimdark far more then is actually called for by the setting
[2:12:37] <Tracazoid> I found it to be a slog until later on, meanwhile 2 starts great
[2:12:39] <@Ranryu692> oh fuck that
[2:12:49] <Wakerpl> Yeah it was tough playing through that, the difficulty curve was INSANE in early game
[2:12:51] <+ultimafullmetal> I couldn't even get into D2 cause of the writing
[2:13:05] <+balouie> many people forget divine divinity
[2:13:08] <+Caidezes> why greg
[2:13:21] <Wakerpl> imagine fighting a boss which spawns 3 other bosses and you're like lvl 20
[2:13:22] <Frankenshop> in D2 I got into a life or death struggle with a woman and her daughter because I stole an apple pie

[2:14:11] <+TopTieramisu> gregnant
[2:14:13] <BigFingerRo> @za7az I also wonder, I just kinda went along with it
[2:14:28] <%luftraumm1> disco elysium, while the best rpg ever created, I feel it's best appreciated after being a bit more familiar with the genre
[2:14:37] <%za7az> @Treasure_Vault AH I JUST NOTICED WTF
[2:14:40] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Hey Greg, I got Jeff Gerstmann to play the CSB UNO game on UPF today

[2:19:50] <hassanico2> Is this some insane "wall jump into character switch into pogo" tech?
[2:20:06] <wqorst> can get up there with hachi/gun but you'd need the big bullet special
[2:20:16] <+balouie> i feel the biggest issue with pathfinder is to much classes that do the same thing the need to cull the classes

[2:21:14] <+healnavi> @dukebeefhammer yes
[2:21:17] <hassanico2> I'm loving how multicultural this stage is
[2:21:20] <%Jerp> Duke: personally I like cotm more, but both are really good
[2:21:33] <%Jerp> wait wait, is cotm actaully more successful than rotn? like sales-wise or something?
[2:21:38] <ExpressNode> Oh ya that new Pokemon game is coming out.
[2:21:39] <%Rozalyndis> i like cotm 1 and 2 way more than rotn
[2:21:58] <Frankenshop> One of the major appeals of the pathfinder tabletop/3.5 is the optimization. Removing similar classes removes a lot of that appeal.
[2:21:58] <mannywatcha> Can you play as dog?

[2:47:08] <+ikantreeed> I sell saliva
[2:47:11] <ammobasket> giving double red with the machine helps you keep from fainting, recover faster
[2:47:12] <OkamiDude15> donating plasma made me cold
[2:47:13] <+ikantreeed> I mean give
[2:47:16] <%Rozalyndis> "i'm tired!" not that that's different from any other day
[2:47:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> She gave blood
[2:47:20] <%JonathLP> Paige should have had the giving blood lunch today so she'd be awake for this

[2:51:11] <%SmiteKnight> Dog train robot is best character.
[2:52:07] <Frankenshop> So... Is this game like a prequel to ritual?
[2:52:21] <+Russo_ZX> reminds me of megaman x riding armors
[2:52:24] <+TopTieramisu> fuggit
[2:52:32] <hassanico2> @Frankenshop no it's its own timeline
[2:52:38] <%DoomRedMage> I think is alternate reality
[2:52:40] <%SmiteKnight> It's a sequel to the other 8 bit Curse of the moon.
[2:53:24] <hassanico2> This seems like a downgrade from CotM1 Gremory
[2:53:27] <%SmiteKnight> Cubby hole
[2:53:35] <Frankenshop> ah, so is ritual the outlier to the timeline then?
[2:53:37] <Gav_EXE> If I'm correct, the safe spot is opposite where her hands point. The color just dictates her follow-up magic.
[2:53:51] <+TopTieramisu> aren't all the crouchable areas safe?

[3:16:55] <Vashido22> the first game already had this gimmick in the final stage but better
[3:17:04] <Vashido22> this one is just annoying
[3:17:25] <%Rozalyndis> the old style games when timing was literally the whole game

[3:17:53] <dashwallkick> nah I love this gimmick, it's perfect old Castlevania, you just gotta get in sync with its bullshit and then you can do it every time
[3:17:57] <Pookiedaexzile> There is a state you can Git Greg

[3:21:04] <Treasure_Vault> Can you ride the mimic with a crawl through that hole? Or does it specifically need timestop
[3:21:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Pupper made this level way easier. Losing the goodest boy definitely ups the difficulty a TON.

[3:37:25] <+healnavi> inti games don't like to force you to replay large chunks of the finale
[3:37:27] <wqorst> use green man for the contra crouch
[3:37:34] <+Masamune_Shadow> 1 up!
[3:37:35] <%StephanieSadGirl> I think train boy's hit box when crouching is too big
[3:37:39] <+TopTieramisu> ?
[3:37:41] <%Agami23> no guys, pat cant permenantly lose, but every bad attempt is a fail
[3:37:46] <marvel877> Just walk down invisible stairs
[3:37:47] <%blastyoboots> yeah that's a green man fight
[3:37:55] <%captain_thickthighs> you gotta swith for better hit boxe
[3:37:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> At least you'll never run out of lives
[3:37:58] <%ClericOfSparda> It's cause Shipoopi
[3:37:59] <+Masamune_Shadow> another 1 up!
[3:38:05] <+inkandamber> I'm so bad at these games...
[3:38:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Switch to Hachi to tank/invincibility through attack you're out of position to dodge and mostly use the others to stay mobile.
[3:38:19] <marvel877> Pat, try the bandana
[3:38:28] <%Rozalyndis> the key is persistence
[3:38:35] <%captain_thickthighs> it's a boss so I assume it wants you to constantly swotch
[3:38:44] <+Masamune_Shadow> wow just let that whole bandana burn
[3:38:44] <dashwallkick> pat your mana
[3:38:46] <dashwallkick> lol
[3:38:47] <%GabeSweetMan> You just ate half you meter doing nothing.
[3:39:08] <marvel877> Pat, you couldve mashed harder on those shots.
[3:39:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> I think the most efficient use of meter is Hachi DPS race
[3:39:19] <+TopTieramisu> please don't lose your healer
[3:39:21] <+polothegreatest> Huhahu
[3:39:29] <%RetroCop87> oh man, they all have low HP
[3:39:34] <+Masamune_Shadow> he's going to lose his healer

[3:42:01] <%spitelite> gun
[3:42:04] <%Agami23> why do you keep doing the super spooky jump off the ledge instead of using the stairs?
[3:42:24] <%StephanieSadGirl> Ledge jump is cooler and faster
[3:42:33] <%Agami23> why are the stairs one way?
[3:42:34] <%za7az> @inkandamber Yeah actually
[3:42:37] <%GabeSweetMan> That's how it is in the Castlevania games too. It's always a faith drop.
[3:42:47] <+TopTieramisu> because it's a secret
[3:42:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> I think Zangetsu's damage buff carries through swaps. Pair it with Invincible Hachi?
[3:42:55] <%Rozalyndis> @Agami23 ask the dev
[3:43:03] <Pookiedaexzile> You have a Gun
[3:43:04] <marvel877> Just spam Roberts bandana.
