[0:01:06] <%absolutely_naught> i'm bad at activating conqueror so I don't push my early power like i should
[0:01:09] <darkmind95> Has he started yet? Is this a break?
[0:01:14] <%absolutely_naught> he is starting now
[0:01:34] <+XxBTExX> He's cleaning his balls before he gets to show em on stream,

[0:02:30] <not_twitter_rowan> @BlackermanZX my man, the doge
[0:02:34] <+Audega> I started playing League for the first time after watching Pat's struggle with it, and I think I kinda love it?
[0:02:35] <BustaGrimez> it has begun floeDolan
[0:02:36] <vingadivo> can't wait to see pat eat shit
[0:02:48] <vingadivo> i wonder if pat is better than me at league
[0:02:51] <$kirbydevilbringer> i am really shocked hes still into this
[0:02:55] <darkmind95> I don't think I have played a single year of LoL seriously since I started like 4-5 years ago
[0:02:55] <not_twitter_rowan> I'm not
[0:02:56] <+XxBTExX> i play ap naut bot... from 10 games 1 illaoi raged at me for not going tank.... bitch was feeding

[0:03:09] <+Cymen90> @vingadivo He only played a dozen games thus far, we have been tracking him. But he is improving fast
[0:03:12] <%SashaStarshine> Conq is busted but I still prefer Phase Rush on Nasus to avoid getting kited to death
[0:03:13] <Colmarr> Hello fellas
[0:03:22] <not_twitter_rowan> @BlackermanZX my first m7 champ, I fucking love him so much, conq nasus is busted

[0:05:18] <Fantomghosthoe> lets gooooooooooooooo

[0:05:36] <+discouragedoblong> So is he still trying to learn jg

[0:06:21] <+2DSuperiority> A LoL stream without Poppy isn't a LoL stream at all
[0:06:22] <DancePad_on_VHS> @crazypieman7 sadly
[0:06:24] <not_twitter_rowan> @Ipsenscastle lanes are symmetrical, jungle is not, it's a bit complex, just accept it until you hit like gold or plat
[0:06:27] <darkmind95> As Long as chat doesn't encourage Pat's WHALING in this game!

[0:06:45] <+discouragedoblong> I've lost like 6 years of my life to this game
[0:06:48] <Aydarkzero> Pog
[0:06:52] <%WheatlyXT> @ipsenscastle The bot lane used to have just two long strips of grass instead of three and is slightly shorter. Top lane is slightly longer and allows for more chasing
[0:06:53] <%solidousstream> @discouragedoblong what is LOL
[0:07:01] <lokiluko> God its been so long, when I played league there were only the golems, wolfs, lizards, the dragon and baron in the jungle. Zilean was even decent at the time. His kit is so limiitied I cant image he still sees any play
[0:07:03] <BlackermanZX> @not_twitter_rowan Its Nasus has been a struggle for a while man. I feel almost every top wins against the dog
[0:07:04] <Cycrosa> @solidousstream hell
[0:07:07] <not_twitter_rowan> @discouragedoblong Ayy me too, what champ was your first
[0:07:08] <%absolutely_naught> i'm here to join queue at the same time as pat in the hopes of getting into his game, but it's futile since i'm ranked and way higher ELO
[0:07:09] <ralphfromdk> crazypieman7 Eh, one can hope. Some day they can go "from the people who made Apex Legends comes that game, but with double jumps and big robots"
[0:07:11] <Warbot40> I still enjoy league even though I don't play anymore cause it's too much of a time sink.
[0:07:12] <+Kurt_0> Poggers
[0:07:13] <Ipsenscastle> thanks everyone!
[0:07:14] <mattgamezz11> League actually confuses me but I love to watch it ,does that make me weird?
[0:07:16] <+discouragedoblong> A trash game for people who feel dead inside
[0:07:18] <+Verd_254> I literally only play this game because my friends do.

[0:09:27] <DancePad_on_VHS> Teemo isn't really that good of a champion but he's great for salt farming
[0:09:30] <%absolutely_naught> you forgot the D
[0:09:32] <+RogueInfinity> Singed is Toxic

[0:09:34] <%absolutely_naught> Thanks for the HahaTurtledove @kiiper
[0:09:34] <+Kurt_0> Can’t wait to see what kind of fighting game they’re cooking up
[0:09:35] <+Positive_Feedback_Loop> Teemo mains are known for their powerful self loathing
[0:09:35] <Zelretch3000> LUL
[0:09:36] <%XxBTExX> Singed is also all kinds of annoying ass but Teemo takes the cake.
[0:09:36] <%bevyrage> teemo is the only champion with two passives: stealth, and a global aggro range
[0:09:39] <alwayspronking> IT BEGINS
[0:09:43] <Tempmael> dont chase the singed LUL
[0:09:43] <%SashaStarshine> LUL
[0:09:44] <MattDemers> Has anyone created a club within LoL for @AngriestPat/friends to group up?
[0:09:44] <%Mekhet09> Teemo is hard to use.
[0:09:44] <NSwarmlord> LUL LUL LUL
[0:09:45] <+MisterRockett> HE IS
[0:09:48] <not_twitter_rowan> @AngriestPat you should play Nasus, he's the core of a big number champion

[0:09:54] <Fantomghosthoe> YES MORE SINGED
[0:09:54] <%SashaStarshine> Færgas
[0:09:54] <%absolutely_naught> but you lost horribly on singed
[0:09:56] <%boxofhooligans> I see you've met the number rule of LoL.
[0:09:56] <+discouragedoblong> Pat, just a warning, teemo is one of those champs that are only good if you're good at the champ
[0:09:57] <lomack42> teemo 🍄 🍄
[0:09:57] <%blastazoid26> @AngriestPat What's your favorite character so far?
[0:09:59] <The_Baaz> Teemo is gross, Pick Aatrox LUL

[0:28:43] <%solidousstream> does pat hate potions?
[0:28:43] <NeroCapone> man league of legends somehow manages to still suffer from the classic MMO style of User interface for ANTS
[0:28:44] <beanfriction> time for boots powerspike
[0:28:44] <+Cynacious> do they not have a jungler?
[0:28:48] <ShadeTheNovice> You need to leave before you see them
[0:28:51] <%CalderGaming> keeping track of when the opponents will be back takes experience
[0:28:51] <vingadivo> pat aatrox is useless if he cant reach you with the sweetspot of his Q
[0:28:51] <+legend_of_nolan> yo my dude it all good
[0:28:52] <mankeyfigh> FAR TOO LATE
[0:28:53] <+discouragedoblong> @AngriestPat when you're pushing mid, you want to have a ward on the bush in the river in case jg comes to gank you
[0:28:53] <mayorrev> just got here did Pat get yelled at by any chance
[0:28:55] <Tressing> pushed too much
[0:28:57] <+discouragedoblong> TOP I mean fuck'
[0:28:57] <+ledgefiendd> pat is greedy boi
[0:29:02] <%Mekhet09> Lol pat's really bad at understanding when to get the fuck out and when to go in.
[0:29:09] <clueless_reaper> Why no team pings?
[0:29:10] <%Garthunox> they might it's just the support ditched top
[0:29:10] <%Albadabar> He's learning
[0:29:11] <Prelate_havok> lol oh man
[0:29:13] <flyingtentaclemonster> @angriestpat after you get a tower plate is usually a good time to back off
[0:29:14] <@commanderclaw> It could be better too
[0:29:15] <vingadivo> yup
[0:29:16] <%WritebroAlpha> Drop your pink ward in your tri bush
[0:29:17] <krabthecrab> Pat doesn't get yelled at because he gags his team
[0:29:18] <@JustinianKnight> he turned off pings
[0:29:18] <+rj1771> wtf is going on down bot?
[0:29:20] <%ItsRatman> you're still doing REALLY well for a new player
[0:29:20] <+Positive_Feedback_Loop> On Darius you just go in always
[0:29:22] <+bananawarrior1> what level is he now?
[0:29:24] <Ner234> I don't know shit about MOBAs. I'm just hear to watch Pat bumble around. LUL
[0:29:27] <Zebroneath> Is this the beginning of Pat's pro LoL stream days?
[0:29:28] <NSwarmlord> Oh god watching him not use W to last hit is so AAAAAAAA
[0:29:29] <KattyCitty> w is also a great ability to get cs you think you might not!
[0:29:29] <darkmind95> Last Hit With W
[0:29:29] <ape_hawk> hi goons
[0:29:29] <Tressing> Keep in mind Sona's ult
[0:29:31] <+tire_marqs> JUST CHILL AND FARM FOR A BIT
[0:29:31] <%Albadabar> lmao someone died to jungle creep
[0:29:31] <+discouragedoblong> Use pink in tri and yello in rivier
[0:29:33] <+obeseninja12> pat, you can use your W to farm on darius
[0:29:34] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Damn I have not played league in so many years, I have no advice because god damn it looks so different. since its league you are probably getting to much anyway. thanks for all the death stranding streams they are really good to go through
[0:29:35] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:29:37] <hntronium> true, it could be worse, your friends could be getting fucked even harder
[0:29:42] <koolaid_kevster> it takes about 10 sec to walk back to lane so try to find a recall after you kill/force recall
[0:29:43] <+ledgefiendd> does pat know about animation cancelling auto attacks?
[0:29:43] <ape_hawk> so, anyone else gona watch Crisis on Infinite Earths?
[0:29:45] <+officialprisonmike> you can last hit minions with W it lowers the cooldown
[0:29:48] <PoonOfChaos> your W also refunds mana if you kill a minion so it helps you farm if you get last hit @AngriestPat
[0:29:50] <KattyCitty> they might be doing rift herald
[0:29:51] <KattyCitty> go check it
[0:29:53] <%WritebroAlpha> HahaSweet
[0:29:55] <darkmind95> Pat pinged MISSING! I'm so proud!
[0:29:55] <%Alpha8087> Can you deny creep in LoL?
[0:29:57] <%Mekhet09> They've been roaming.
[0:29:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> i think he was bot lol
[0:30:00] <+discouragedoblong> oof
[0:30:01] <PPunktAlex> hol' up, Sona was on a killstreak?
[0:30:01] <%Albadabar> Oh they're all bot
[0:30:01] <+discouragedoblong> cringe
[0:30:02] <+RogueInfinity> Don't be afraid of using abilities to get CS under tower. Better to have more farm than just a little bit more mana
[0:30:02] <Angry_Ev1L> wow your team sucks
[0:30:04] <TheEvilOmega> Kill the waaaard, Pat.
[0:30:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> yep

[0:30:18] <+Glock3bb> Pat, should use wards in river 90% of the time.
[0:30:19] <+obeseninja12> you see that red eye, it's a control ward, you gotta kill it
[0:30:19] <%XxBTExX> nope

[0:30:57] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Your W gets it's mana cost and half it's cooldown refunded if you kill the target with it, meaning that you can last hit with it for free.

[0:31:22] <beanfriction> Kill the ward, please
[0:31:23] <vingadivo> pat the trick to csing under tower is to let melee minions get hit by tower twice before you atack them
[0:31:31] <Haarute> #killtheward

[0:31:35] <Tressing> Nocturne got a gank

[0:31:43] <ralphfromdk> He's the top left one
[0:31:45] <+Beruptor> Hay Pat, a lot of champions have abilities that work like Darius' W. They modify your basic attack and let you cancel your auto attack animations.
[0:31:49] <%Shadowthedigger> Auto sorted so your lane opponent is across from you on scoreboard.
[0:31:50] <KattyCitty> generally tab is ordered top>jg>mid>adc>supp
[0:31:50] <vingadivo> if you want to cs better pay attention to the missiles from you caster minions
[0:31:52] <%Typhaeon> Nice whiffs LuL
[0:31:52] <%The_Baaz> the tab menu is in order by lane, so aatrox will be on the top
[0:31:54] <%WritebroAlpha> It goes top > jungle > mid > adc > support

[0:32:51] <TundraOW> Is Pat just getting 4 level 1 items
[0:32:54] <+rj1771> He's got a Black Cleaver, so every time he hits you it'll shred armor
[0:32:54] <ShadeTheNovice> Left side is his team, right is yours, hes at the top left
[0:32:56] <+Glock3bb> Should grab a Mortal Reminder item. Cuts healing of enemies you hit.
[0:32:56] <+RogueInfinity> Top lanes are always at the top fo the board
[0:32:58] <+Linearlinera> top left
[0:32:59] <%boxofhooligans> You need to hit him with the end of your Q Axe to do full Damage
[0:32:59] <+Bricespresso> he got cleaver
[0:33:00] <Tressing> On the left
[0:33:01] <thealientrilogy> Please play OBSERVER again Pat.
[0:33:04] <+drawminomicon> Pat doesnt know what default splash looks like right off hand so its hard for him to know which one is aatrox
[0:33:06] <shiny_prinny> also, if you left click on him, it shows up at the top of the screen
[0:33:10] <sirkingofbooty> has this become a league stream now?
[0:33:12] <dakkster> just remember, we were all this bad at one point, if you claim otherwise, you lying
[0:33:12] <+Chosington> I have to say I adore that you can tell everyone in here who ever touched League and goes nuts from Pat's decisions LUL
[0:33:16] <+riscuit> he shreds armor because he has a built item

[0:34:17] <vingadivo> pat use your ward on the river bush by prsssing 4, it'll help you see incoming ganks
[0:34:20] <+ledgefiendd> Someone should tell pat how to left click his opponent and read their items

[0:35:23] <OldManDeckardCain> LET SALT FLOW THROUGH YOU
[0:35:24] <+Jekado> @AngriestPat the best time to use flash and jukes is right as they enter the bush because they lose vision
[0:35:24] <+maxtheflea> Let it flow, Patrick.
[0:35:25] <Tubit> oh oby
[0:35:26] <vingadivo> pat when your enemy is stronger than you you should avoid killing the minions quickly
[0:35:27] <koolaid_kevster> poggers
[0:35:30] <+zinris> DOUBLEE???
[0:35:31] <+korean_random> I like where this is going
[0:35:32] <ShadeTheNovice> But please ward before moving forward Pat
[0:35:33] <%luftraumm1> but you did great
[0:35:34] <Ipsenscastle> @SilentEric thanks :)
[0:35:36] <+rj1771> @N_Wolfwood Yeah, think he just picked it up last week. Apparently he tried it like a year ago, didn't like it, but with the downfall of Heroes of the Storm, Pat figured he'd try this out again. Seems like he's been having fun.
[0:35:36] <%boxofhooligans> You were very smart little guy
[0:35:37] <Tressing> Legit a great play Pat.. but try to track the enemy jungle
[0:35:41] <%ledgefiendd> you gotta pretty good dodge there pat, not much you could do in a checkmate scenario
[0:35:44] <+Vegaburd> Playing from behind is a whole different game
[0:35:46] <OldManDeckardCain> PJSalt
[0:35:51] <%WritebroAlpha> WAIT IS PAT BUILDING TRIFORCE
[0:35:53] <vingadivo> kill the minions slowly so you dont get killed by him again
[0:35:54] <%dasmause> @Tressing that was their bot
[0:35:56] <%luftraumm1> maybe a ward could have helped?
[0:35:58] <%Albadabar> Looks like Cait is kicking ass, just keep pushing top my dude
[0:36:04] <%dasmause> mid*
[0:36:05] <Afrosaber> @angriestpat don’t bother having two movement summer spells switch ghost out for teleport
[0:36:07] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat I only feel like this when I watch Paige’s streams
[0:36:07] <%WritebroAlpha> I just noticed, thought he was going Cleaver after the Phager
[0:36:08] <%TweetHeart> Plating is down. The real Demons' Souls starts now
[0:36:09] <%wsintai> @WritebroAlpha Phreak's soul has entered his body
[0:36:12] <+obeseninja12> Triforce is for big dick darius players
[0:36:14] <ShadeTheNovice> Triforce Darius, the good old days
[0:36:19] <Manwad> You can get Trinity force. It's 333 after all components are bought
[0:36:19] <+Jekado> i haven't played in ages so i'm unsure about everything now tho
[0:36:20] <+rj1771> Triforce Darius....wow.
[0:36:25] <+riscuit> should get teleport tbh
[0:36:28] <Afrosaber> @angriestpat not sure about many spells you get at your current level though
[0:36:30] <koolaid_kevster> last hit bud let the minions get low enough to were you only have to auto once

[0:36:38] <ShadeTheNovice> WARD
[0:36:41] <$QueequegTheater> Somewhere in Montreal, Woolie feels himself becoming bored for some reason
[0:36:42] <@BigNaturalMan59> geaux tigers
[0:36:43] <flyingtentaclemonster> He is following an apps build
[0:36:44] <+Vegaburd> honestly this makes me want to get back into league

[0:36:46] <+Chosington> cheers for the HahaShrugRight @poonofchaos
[0:36:47] <+Luigicow92k> Ghost is good for darius because it helps him actually get to people
[0:36:47] <+Jekado> what are those dots under tower?
[0:36:48] <%Shadowthedigger> Shove that lane pat
[0:36:51] <%Shadowthedigger> Shove it hard
[0:36:51] <1matheuw> is pat tinkering with his runes?
[0:36:51] <+drawminomicon> map awareness my friend
[0:36:52] <%ledgefiendd> ledgefiendd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! when you feel comfortable you should start left clicking your opponents and reading the passives of their items. Left click opens a thing in the top left of the screen
[0:36:52] <%WritebroAlpha> Yeah Pat, keep shoving top in
[0:36:53] <%ledgefiendd> ledgefiendd's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:36:54] <+rj1771> Time to start roaming, Pat!
[0:36:58] <%Albadabar> Yeah keep pushing, put pressure on them
[0:37:01] <+Bricespresso> push to second tower
[0:37:01] <ShadeTheNovice> Ward the bush to your right and push
[0:37:02] <%boxofhooligans> use Q to push waves, W helps to but for single targets
[0:37:02] <%wsintai> Split pushing FTW!
[0:37:03] <vingadivo> pat try and walk between each auto aatack when you're csing it'll help you avoid accidentally killing them without getting the gold
[0:37:03] <1matheuw> go further pat dont worry
[0:37:04] <zecht89> push pat, push
[0:37:08] <zenith0111> Riveting?
[0:37:13] <TundraOW> Teamfights? Nah, solo push
[0:37:14] <+discouragedoblong> Use your abilites to farm faster
[0:37:14] <+Reveresao> now eun
[0:37:15] <zecht89> use your q
[0:37:16] <beanfriction> Pat WARD
[0:37:16] <+Jekado> start backing when they dissapear
[0:37:19] <%WritebroAlpha> mmm, solo xp
[0:37:19] <+Cymen90> @AngriestPat For Gold you need to last hit
[0:37:19] <1matheuw> the enemy cant see you if they dont have towers
[0:37:19] <+kingofcinders> @AngriestPat Pat, barring a few exceptions, most champions max out 1 spell and then another. Putting 2 points in the ones you're not maxing is actually hindering you. Darius' E has passive armor penetration which will make you deal a lot more damage.
[0:37:19] <MyNameIsRasus> ward
[0:37:21] <@JustinianKnight> time to leave
[0:37:26] <universaldove> God this just makes me miss Zz'rot Q_Q

[0:39:04] <+rj1771> With your passive you could have had a good shot
[0:39:04] <Zteck123> that was not the time for coward tactics
[0:39:05] <Haarute> that's one of those situations you just don't want to be in
[0:39:06] <+claudesavegely> is Shen still bad
[0:39:06] <MyNameIsRasus> That's his ultimate. Makes him faster, strong er, better

[0:40:16] <valriot> Literally tune in and salt is flowing already
[0:40:19] <+discouragedoblong> Just a tip, flash is honestly the best ability in the game
[0:40:20] <%luftraumm1> good try
[0:40:27] <RAH001> holy shit pat i love you lol xD
[0:40:27] <Finchit> this is a good game. Everyone is on the same level it seems
[0:40:28] <+anhero64> towers are a cowards best friend
[0:40:28] <ShadeTheNovice> Dont be afraid of using your stuff
[0:40:28] <+Jekado> GG i guess since surrender
[0:40:29] <%ahl9307> flasssshhhh
[0:40:34] <Tressing> Weak sauce team wanna surrender?
[0:40:34] <+twitchmaster4500> @krabthecrab Noc is actually one of the best champs in the game this patch, what
[0:40:34] <Darkmega97> Be gooder
[0:40:35] <+Vegaburd> use ult as execution
[0:40:35] <shiny_prinny> there are multiple conditions
[0:40:37] <+discouragedoblong> If it kills them its wortg
[0:40:37] <Afrosaber> Gotta last hit champs with that ULT pat
[0:40:37] <%Reevesypoo> Dont listen to chat
[0:40:37] <@JustinianKnight> when theyre low just do it
[0:40:39] <+zinris> it executes
[0:40:39] <+Jekado> is surrender vote at 3 or 4?
[0:40:40] <%Reevesypoo> They are big babies
[0:40:40] <not_twitter_rowan> Yes, but she was super low, it's an execution
[0:40:40] <+trunubus> i5s true
[0:40:41] <reddpop_> everyone is going to yell at you anyway
[0:40:41] <KattyCitty> as long as the ult gets a kill it works
[0:40:45] <%Agami23> you are always playing the game wrong no matter what
[0:40:45] <vingadivo> true
[0:40:45] <%SashaStarshine> thats the problem with a big beginner stream >_>
[0:40:46] <%SilentEric> True, but if they are low it resets the cooldown right?
[0:40:47] <@BigNaturalMan59> he screech
[0:40:47] <cham52> Last stream was poo we are the GOOD stream
[0:40:48] <+Vegaburd> or at 5 stacks
[0:40:48] <leonegaming6> yeah sounds about right. sounds like the league community to me
[0:40:48] <+obeseninja12> stacks make it do more damage but if it kills iti s fine
[0:40:49] <+SpiceMustF1ow> It's League. You're going to get yelled at regardless
[0:40:50] <+GimmMeUhSammich> we will tell no matter what
[0:40:50] <MrTickleTrunk> use stacks when they're NOT low :)
[0:40:50] <theKingRamses> you wait for 5 stacks if they're not on low hp
[0:40:51] <+Peacockney> When you execute someone with it, it resets
[0:40:52] <Tressing> She was very low tho
[0:40:52] <+Jekado> oh has to be unanimous
[0:40:53] <%Albadabar> His ult is an execute so you get it back if you kill at low health
[0:40:55] <%galaxyswirl> you were ded anyway might as well go for it @AngriestPat
[0:40:58] <%WritebroAlpha> The ult does more damage with more stacks, but she was low enough hp that a raw ult would have done the job
[0:40:58] <+trunubus> but if she's low enough why not
[0:40:59] <+Cymen90> They were SCRUBS who do not understand situational value @AngriestPat
[0:41:03] <%GingaNZ> death is the hardest CC
[0:41:03] <@JustinianKnight> listen to your heart and dunk
[0:41:03] <Rotharn> @Jekado 5/5 for 15-20min, 4/5 for 20min+
[0:41:04] <+rj1771> If nothing else it would have gotten you further away from Aatrox and you could have finished Sona off and kept running
[0:41:06] <+Jekado> if your gonna die its worth the trade too pat
[0:41:07] <shiny_prinny> if you kill with the ult, you get another ult free within 20 seconds or something
[0:41:10] <vingadivo> pat dont bother trying to be perfect just fry and improve a bit each time :)
[0:41:11] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Are you winnin son?
[0:41:11] <%SilentEric> Take her gamercube!
[0:41:17] <cham52> Sona is the best she has big anime tiddies
[0:41:19] <%SilentEric> Pat is jealous of Sona
[0:41:19] <+Glock3bb> Wish they'd add an execute marker for Darius ult like other champs have.
[0:41:20] <universaldove> Darius ult confused the hell out of me first time I played him, mostly because I was used to Garen.
[0:41:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Sona can be annoying af
[0:41:21] <freezydude> More experience with darius and damage in general you'll just know when to ult really
[0:41:23] <+GimmMeUhSammich> ARAM TINE
[0:41:24] <zenith0111> Takes league way to seriously ^ Kappa
[0:41:27] <+Dr_Mooose> bye team
[0:41:28] <+Monkeydude07> F
[0:41:31] <Forester_Skippy> i mean as long as she has less then the no stack treshhold its fine to just throw it out i guess
[0:41:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Was that an Amumu I saw
[0:41:32] <%luftraumm1> sona is a b
[0:41:33] <shizzlebizzfizz> what compelled him to play this game again? it feels so out of character of him lol
[0:41:35] <+MinimumPayne> wew
[0:41:36] <+Jekado> @Rotharn thanks i'm use to auto surrender vote at 15 then afk feed for the rest of the match
[0:41:36] <+Vegaburd> man, low level league is almost as entertaining as high level
[0:41:38] <Iggeh0> Sona Amumu ults wreck you in teamfights lol
[0:41:39] <vingadivo> aatrox is very stronk
[0:41:40] <%SilentEric> Sona's ult forces you to dance
[0:41:41] <$QueequegTheater> F
[0:41:42] <+Peacockney> They have a pretty nasty engage team
[0:41:43] <valriot> Bet that old lady complains at restaurants
[0:41:43] <Ipsenscastle> that was a disaster
[0:41:45] <Rhinoprotoss> Why does his guide tell him to build Triforce?
[0:41:46] <+MinimumPayne> aatrox took no dmg from that
[0:41:50] <%WritebroAlpha> Aatrox is really cool, actually
[0:41:54] <Finaldragoon> good to know that people still play my waifu Sona
[0:41:54] <Kuubyy> Everyone fucks with us
[0:41:55] <SoushinSen> if your ult kill someone, you get another ult.
[0:41:55] <%SashaStarshine> Oh boy i bet the all-chat is going crazy right now
[0:41:55] <+rj1771> I've got a feeling this Talon his garbo. pooHotgarbage pooHotgarbage
[0:41:55] <Tressing> They have too much crowd control
[0:41:55] <Prelate_havok> lol
[0:41:56] <ShadeTheNovice> Yeah try not to group up too close to your teamates, aoe whrecks you then
[0:41:57] <vingadivo> aatrox is super cool
[0:41:58] <freezydude> @shizzlebizzfizz HOTS died and he'd rather play this game than dota because he has old friends who play league.
[0:41:59] <+riscuit> triforce was a strange pick tbh
[0:42:02] <%luftraumm1> amumu is soooooo annoying
[0:42:02] <valriot> Pick a waifu character
[0:42:02] <Bloodxb> cuz triforce is good in darius
[0:42:02] <shiny_prinny> aatrox has deaths dance so he'll heal everything
[0:42:02] <%Mekhet09> Triforce probably to mash him early.
[0:42:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Aatrox so nice this is him after like 10 nerfs
[0:42:06] <beanfriction> Aatrox healed back loadsadamaga
[0:42:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat would really like Aatrox. He basically is Aatrox, minus the whole sword vessel thing
[0:42:13] <+Jekado> i'm surpised they don't barron or whatever its called now
[0:42:13] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat PAT It's just like ff14, don't stand in that area when he's doing the thing
[0:42:17] <vingadivo> at this point you basically jjst wnat to defend and kill minons fighting is a nono
[0:42:19] <not_twitter_rowan> @riscuit he's just following recommended builds
[0:42:20] <+sindrantz> YOINK
[0:42:20] <PowerfulBlackGangs> So, did Pat break down and buy any champs?
[0:42:21] <%blastazoid26> Bit whiff
[0:42:21] <+Jekado> i guess get a inhib first

[0:42:53] <+Jekado> they are staying to single and diving too much
[0:42:53] <+Peacockney> This Talon ain't even going in through the back
[0:42:55] <zecht89> you need tank items pat
[0:42:55] <hntronium> @PowerfulBlackGangs Morde

[0:42:59] <+zinris> aatrox too big
[0:43:01] <%nmaten> they have an insane midgame teamfight comp
[0:43:02] <%WritebroAlpha> @reiju_22 they just added an update in the latest patch that changes the map based on which dragon spawns; ocean makes it rain, makes more brush and more healing plants across the map
[0:43:04] <vingadivo> pat when you're losing like this is better to not fight at all and just try and defend when you can
[0:43:07] <universaldove> @reiju_22 Weather and other effects come into play based on the Dragons
[0:43:07] <mankeyfigh> No shit
[0:43:08] <%blastazoid26> Tank up, Pat
[0:43:09] <ScrubTheNerd> Well they're ahead in kills and have an extra turret down, so yeah
[0:43:09] <+anhero64> towers are always cold and need to be hugged
[0:43:09] <asurite_warrior> Any of them stream sniping?
[0:43:10] <+riscuit> need some armor maybe
[0:43:13] <not_twitter_rowan> @koolaid_kevster let's keep itemization for after he learns how to use abilties
[0:43:14] <koolaid_kevster> no the comps are basically the same
[0:43:15] <+Peacockney> Yeah you need to get tanky
[0:43:15] <%LaughingCatt> Aatrox is fed as fuck
[0:43:15] <+Jekado> focus out the supports its what i try to do
[0:43:18] <+Cymen90> @zecht89 He does not want to focus on situational itemization yet.

[0:44:47] <@JustinianKnight> yea he does aoe around him and stuns
[0:44:48] <+BossPlayerOG> is this still normals or is pat ranked?
[0:44:48] <MarylandJutsu> If elmo played a LoL charecter, which one would it be
[0:44:49] <Tressing> got too greedy
[0:44:50] <%WritebroAlpha> YOU MUST DENY THE SAD MUMMY ANY PHYSICAL AFFECTION
[0:44:50] <Ragnakawaii> Trinity Force Kreygasm
[0:44:54] <Finaldragoon> nuke down Sona, she's in the gamercube just like you buffing/healing the enemy team
[0:44:57] <Damie904> @AngriestPat The Mummy is a tank. He wants you to focus on him.
[0:45:01] <darkmind95> Pointless ADC and MID, Nocturne afk farming, gg XP
[0:45:01] <%GunEden> blitz is stupid
[0:45:04] <ape_hawk> dont buy stuff that makes you lose, buy stuff that makes you win
[0:45:04] <+Jekado> thats fine
[0:45:05] <vingadivo> pat when you kill someone with your ultimate you get a massive buff basically
[0:45:05] <+Baekon01> use them potions
[0:45:05] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat Here's some advice ping missing when people aren't in lane.
[0:45:08] <Rhinoprotoss> Sometimes you shouldn't be going in a row
[0:45:09] <+MisterRockett> Buy your potions too tho
[0:45:10] <Finchit> @AngriestPat rule #1 playing league. Dont listen to chat
[0:45:12] <Haarute> that's fair.
[0:45:13] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> If I had to critique that play there, you'd probably want to make sure you capitalize on the buff you get after killing someone with your ult
[0:45:15] <MarylandJutsu> An elmo has been slain
[0:45:17] <+MisterRockett> The potions are direct upgrades
[0:45:18] <shinji_ifrit> yes, it is better than not anything
[0:45:20] <%nmaten> the only thing id change is going for black cleaver instead of triforce unless youre way ahead
[0:45:21] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> learning mechanics is more important
[0:45:21] <%GingaNZ> thats true, but reading your items iis also good
[0:45:22] <%SilentEric> Blitz is good
[0:45:23] <ShadeTheNovice> Sure, but we want you to go beyond that
[0:45:24] <freezydude> Pat's not really in a state where counter itemizing is a thing
[0:45:24] <%WritebroAlpha> The core build is good for generic builds, but against specialized teams like this there are some easy changes
[0:45:25] <%Bailey__gaming> i just like the number go up
[0:45:28] <Tunykun> so long as you learn what the items do, it shouldnt matter if you follow blitzgg
[0:45:30] <zenith0111> Takes league way to seriously ^ Kappa
[0:45:33] <%WritebroAlpha> Change your boots from Merc Treads to Ninja Tabi
[0:45:33] <+Jekado> @AngriestPat eventually you find your own build for your own playstyle it might not be meta but being comfortable with it is better
[0:45:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> If it's not anything, then it is something
[0:45:36] <zecht89> that's fine but your team doesn't have a tank
[0:45:36] <%NSwarmlord> nswarmlord subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:45:37] <%rj1771> Blitz is a good helper, but the key is being able to adapt.
[0:45:37] <%NSwarmlord> nswarmlord's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:45:39] <TheEvilOmega> You need to build bruiser with Darius, Pat.
[0:45:40] <freezydude> click on them.
[0:45:42] <%blastazoid26> Aatrox is stupid fed
[0:45:42] <+kingofcinders> @AngriestPat Pat, you should *really* max out one ability after another and without exception, on Darius you should be maxing R -> Q -> E -> W.
[0:45:42] <freezydude> no?
[0:45:42] <+Radiantomega> yea anti heal is sorely needed
[0:45:43] <shinji_ifrit> ah shit
[0:45:44] <Tunykun> F
[0:45:46] <%LaughingCatt> Anyway to adjust text size?
[0:45:46] <%GunEden> nobody buying exec
[0:45:47] <ScrubTheNerd> Oh for real? That's kinda important to know
[0:45:47] <%Mekhet09> You can't change that?
[0:45:49] <%SilentEric> Oh no
[0:45:49] <+Radkon> Get those opera glasses
[0:45:50] <+Reveresao> they are steamrolling NotLikeThis
[0:45:51] <%wsintai> I think there is an option to increase the size of text
[0:45:52] <Darkmega97> Ascended Brain
[0:45:52] <Palmer_Huntaway> go back to shop
[0:45:53] <%Mekhet09> You should be able to.
[0:45:53] <freezydude> oof
[0:45:54] <ape_hawk> get a smaller tv
[0:45:54] <shiny_prinny> is there an option to make it bigger?
[0:45:54] <ShadeTheNovice> You can make the text larger
[0:45:54] <Manwad> darn
[0:45:54] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat swap out triforce for black cleaver unless you have a big lead
[0:45:55] <KingGrimlock1> @AngriestPat i think you'd love aatrox; he's the devilman looking bastard with the greatsword
[0:45:55] <+Cymen90> @freezydude He is playing on a TV
[0:45:55] <%galaxyswirl> the problem here is you are building to lit, since the rest of your team is too squishy
[0:45:56] <+Jekado> i use to do an on hit teemo which was meh but i liked playing it
[0:45:57] <DiscoNinjaWolf> but you do know what the items do right?
[0:45:57] <Rhinoprotoss> Oh your setup just sucks
[0:45:59] <Forester_Skippy> as someone with a tv set up i can say it really is way too small
[0:46:01] <+anhero64> no font size option?
[0:46:02] <SilverJakler> Pat you should max E second, not W because it gives you more Armor Penetration
[0:46:02] <%boxofhooligans> Boomer eyes
[0:46:02] <%wsintai> In options somewhere
[0:46:05] <Palmer_Huntaway> click the icon near the search bar
[0:46:07] <Tunykun> He has one of those absurd monitors/tv guys
[0:46:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> dont act like you didnt created that problem yourself
[0:46:13] <krabthecrab> Mole eyes
[0:46:15] <%SashaStarshine> I would simply see better
[0:46:18] <%PoonOfChaos> @AngriestPat Item build is situational not just something you just follow each game
[0:46:18] <+anhero64> dang
[0:46:19] <koolaid_kevster> if you execute a enemy you get max stacks on your passive granting you bonus ad and max stacks kn everyone you touch but it only stays up for like 3 sec if you dont immediately atk someone
[0:46:20] <%Albadabar> Pat's still learning, just let him figure stuff out slowly. This build is fine
[0:46:20] <Palmer_Huntaway> it will make items and desriptions bigger
[0:46:23] <vingadivo> pat try and build the armor itens so you can protect CAitlyn
[0:46:23] <Ipsenscastle> jesus christ
[0:46:23] <@commanderclaw> Get better eyes
[0:46:25] <Darkmega97> just see better dummy
[0:46:26] <asurite_warrior> He's in a living room with a TV not up close to a computer screan
[0:46:27] <+Jekado> is pat using a tv to play LoL?
[0:46:27] <Tressing> If you don't focus Sona, she heals the enemy team to almost full in no time..
[0:46:27] <+RogueInfinity> Pat needs glasses
[0:46:28] <+Chosington> Pat basically has the same monitor thats on Times Square Kappa
[0:46:29] <MyNameIsRasus> i can't see without my gwasses
[0:46:29] <asurite_warrior> screen
[0:46:29] <%wsintai> Get MORE eyes
[0:46:30] <Jodoxk1> move the tv closer? xD
[0:46:33] <%cha0tic_klutch> text to speech lol
[0:46:35] <ociato> The UI does not support 4k properly, that's it
[0:46:35] <$QueequegTheater> Just see faster like Captain America
[0:46:40] <Rhinoprotoss> The other team has so many strong initiates
[0:46:42] <+boredpantz> Pat why not just get binoculars?
[0:46:43] <+Reveresao> he knows you're easy kill
[0:46:45] <zenith0111> LoL is easy to learn guys Kappa stop giving him advice
[0:46:45] <pectusumbra> you are juicy meat now
[0:46:46] <Zedimonx5> Get more insight duh
[0:46:47] <%TweetHeart> 6 sets of eyes
[0:46:52] <%galaxyswirl> OH NO
[0:46:52] <+MisterRockett> BUY THE NEXT POTION IN LINE
[0:46:54] <%SoFarFetched> @AngriestPat Did you know people die when they are killed?
[0:46:55] <%secretspud> Pat, Lock screen to center. It makes learning team fights way easier
[0:46:56] <+Cymen90> Now you see it! MOBAS are a bully simulator where you get to beat your bullies in the lategame.
[0:46:59] <Silversunburst> so the thing with triforce is that you use ability then auto so it's a rhythm that you have to follow otherwise you just waste damage
[0:47:01] <MyNameIsRasus> What if you play in a lower resolution?
[0:47:02] <%WritebroAlpha> You got boots that give Magic Resist but their team mostly does physical damage
[0:47:02] <Finchit> dont listen to our advice just play bruh
[0:47:04] <therealtacopancakes> press the option to show the details of items, top right
[0:47:06] <RAH001> pat can see it just he is far from his tv like in ya living room
[0:47:10] <chester804> I think getting a good understanding of the items is a bit key, since yoiu cant read what they do
[0:47:11] <+drawminomicon> Do not. Lock. Your screen
[0:47:12] <Tunykun> All things considered, definitely way better than last stream session
[0:47:12] <not_twitter_rowan> Pat as a general rule, Black Cleaver is safer than Triforce, Triforce is for when you are ahead
[0:47:13] <+drawminomicon> bad adive
[0:47:13] <Tressing> Game done
[0:47:13] <zenith0111> rmzGG
[0:47:14] <+anhero64> what champs you got bb
[0:47:16] <+MisterRockett> The next potion in line refreshes when you get back to base.
[0:47:20] <$QueequegTheater> That seems like an overreaction for a surrender
[0:47:21] <Rhinoprotoss> Better read on those champs that kicked your ass
[0:47:24] <+Jekado> i would think playing LoL on a tv would be pretty bad
[0:47:27] <VritraReiRei> Guys, I think there's something wrong with the stream, every time i look at it all the colors are grey Kappa
[0:47:27] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat At early levels it's a bad idea to dive past the enemy minions to fight them, you lost the lvl1 fight because of it
[0:47:30] <MyNameIsRasus> You kinda need to be able to read items
[0:47:31] <+Reveresao> 11
[0:47:33] <$QueequegTheater> "Fuck it, let's 9/11 OURSELVES"
[0:47:34] <+kingofcinders> You're gonna be killing people so much easier if you max E second rather than do 2 points in E and 3 in W. :P
[0:47:34] <%WritebroAlpha> Now is the time to look into Aatrox
[0:47:34] <%rj1771> 1/8 Talon, riparoni
[0:47:36] <+Jekado> since most TVs have a bad MS rate
[0:47:41] <Kaede_Viz> Is Pat attempting learn league without the ability to even "read the tooltips". its like step 1
[0:47:43] <+AllenDeadman> how do you unlock draft pick again?
[0:47:44] <%Garthunox> so then you dont know what items give what stats or even active use items if you get any
[0:47:44] <shevan123> @AngriestPat may i suggest you play veigar?
[0:47:44] <freezydude> wait pat you like support?
[0:47:48] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Hard A trox
[0:47:53] <koolaid_kevster> @angriestpat this early in your league gaming there's no reason to ff cause y oi u can always practice with you abilities and such
[0:47:54] <freezydude> A-Aron
[0:47:56] <TundraOW> DEVILMAN
[0:47:56] <%Deadbulky> AA trox is a high skill cap champ
[0:47:57] <ShadeTheNovice> League is a heavy numbers game, so knowing items is much more a key to success than you realize
[0:47:58] <stoccton> angry sword man
[0:47:58] <%Typhaeon> That AA-ron skin was terrible
[0:47:59] <%wsintai> He's just a devil trigger
[0:48:01] <%PoonOfChaos> @AngriestPat Ill offer free coaching while your in-game :) builds are situational not something you should just follow off some site
[0:48:04] <universaldove> Did they remove the option to make item sets?
[0:48:05] <Palmer_Huntaway> Pat there is an option in the shop that will make items and descriptions pop up in the shop UI
[0:48:06] <@commanderclaw> The way Pat was saying Aatrox made him sound like Rich Evans
[0:48:08] <+trunubus> Astros is very fighting games
[0:48:08] <+Jekado> he has a rekka?
[0:48:08] <MyNameIsRasus> He's just devilman
[0:48:10] <mankeyfigh> You feed just a little bit, or like a lot
[0:48:11] <+anhero64> bard is p based you should cop tbh
[0:48:12] <%CalamitousTea> Aatrox can be fun, but is really difficult for a new player.
[0:48:16] <freezydude> he's got a rekka and sweetspot mechanic
[0:48:24] <+RonDewing> ive never seen a moba in action, so im interested to see why its popular
[0:48:31] <%kyh9> NO, its a health-steal
[0:48:31] <%nmaten> he can dash during his q start up
[0:48:34] <dcikchocolate> just go look at with illaoi can do and see if you like it
[0:48:34] <+Jekado> seems side dodges are good against him for some of his pokes?
[0:48:36] <Tunykun> He used to have a revive on his R pat. lol
[0:48:37] <+boredpantz> WORLD ENDER
[0:48:38] <+Bittervanilla> Sounds pretty cool
[0:48:41] <+RogueInfinity> It used to reviver lol
[0:48:41] <%kyh9> His E is a passive that heals him after damaging engmies
[0:48:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> AaTROX IS SUPER RAD
[0:48:46] <%Typhaeon> Bray Wyatt champ
[0:48:47] <MassConnect> something about free. free = popular
[0:48:48] <shevan123> OH YEAH HE DID
[0:48:48] <%LaughingCatt> he a bruisy boy
[0:48:48] <%kyh9> it was broken
[0:48:51] <KingGrimlock1> aatrox has the best voice in the game period
[0:48:51] <zenith0111> @rondewing Shit ton of mechanics almost to the point of redundancy
[0:48:51] <Rhinoprotoss> He used to be a different character
[0:48:53] <Tressing> HIS DASH GOES THROUGH WALLS
[0:48:55] <vingadivo> pat what you're doing right now is you're jjst letting your character atack minions and that way you're losing a lot of cs, try and stop atacking and let you lr minions hit the anemy minions until they're low health, and then you can atack then and kill for the gold
[0:48:56] <+riscuit> they ruined aatrox by taking away his revive
[0:48:56] <freezydude> Pat playing support is very out of character
[0:48:58] <+trunubus> he was super busted
[0:48:59] <%Deadbulky> He used to be good LUL
[0:49:01] <+boredpantz> @AngriestPat He could move while he was reviving as well
[0:49:04] <+AllenDeadman> he was broken, they reworked him, he was trash, and then they buffed him
[0:49:07] <+AllenDeadman> and now he good
[0:49:07] <%Mekhet09> They got rid of it because he was broken.
[0:49:15] <darkmind95> It's better to learn most items
[0:49:15] <+Jam_Jam> you should buy more potions when you go back to base
[0:49:17] <%SashaStarshine> Aatrox used to be super busted. Then he was one of the worst champs in the game for 5 years and then they updated him and he became super busted again
[0:49:21] <+RogueInfinity> You'll learn the items over time. Don't except to know everything
[0:49:25] <MarylandJutsu> @AngriestPat if elmo would choose a charecter from Lol which one do you think it would be?
[0:49:29] <+RogueInfinity> expect*
[0:49:30] <%Mekhet09> Where's your hextech?
[0:49:33] <%nmaten> the problem with making item sets is that you really want to build differently depending on the enemy team
[0:49:34] <MyNameIsRasus> What if you lower it to 1920x1080? Wouldn't it make the windows bigger?
[0:49:39] <+Cymen90> @Mekhet09 Sounds like a bad way to design. Removal is admission of defeat.
[0:49:40] <%WritebroAlpha> Simplest thing to remember about items Pat! Boots for top lane: Mercury Treads against magic damage, Ninja Tabi against physical damage!
[0:49:42] <%Deadbulky> U can make custom loadouts 2
[0:49:44] <Rhinoprotoss> It's more important to know when you need what
[0:49:45] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat do you know why trinity force is good on darius
[0:49:46] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, if you want a relaxing game just play Nasus
[0:49:48] <%SilentEric> Just knowing the core parts of your build is good.
[0:49:50] <SoushinSen> are links allowed in chat? What's the blitz thing Pat is using? i'd like to try it.
[0:49:51] <+arancet> glitch
[0:49:51] <+RogueInfinity> Differnt game modes
[0:49:52] <Forester_Skippy> it shows all items fro mall modes is the problem
[0:49:52] <%TweetHeart> Different modes items
[0:49:53] <+anhero64> who've you played so far?
[0:49:53] <%PoonOfChaos> @AngriestPat damnit pat xD you need to learn team comps to know what to choose item wise in a game
[0:49:54] <Finchit> LOL
[0:49:54] <%Deadbulky> Bug
[0:49:54] <+MisterRockett> Look at the one bellow it.
[0:49:55] <freezydude> I think thats for a different map
[0:49:56] <freezydude> or gamemode
[0:49:57] <%SashaStarshine> LUL
[0:49:57] <Tunykun> A bug
[0:49:57] <+D00msDayDan> just get a spyglass
[0:49:57] <%Mekhet09> They'd have to make him bad again to justify that revive.
[0:49:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Different game modes
[0:50:00] <+drawminomicon> Pat its going to be very hard for you to learn this game playing on a tv that you cant read on.
[0:50:01] <%rj1771> That's a Glitch Potion
[0:50:03] <+Jekado> thats kinda problem matic because sometimes you want to adapt your build on who your fighting
[0:50:06] <vingadivo> a bug lol
[0:50:08] <%wujak> some of these are weird character or mode specific things
[0:50:09] <%SilentEric> Different game modes have different items for balance reasons
[0:50:09] <+D00msDayDan> or a monocular
[0:50:12] <%CalamitousTea> Pat some items are not for the regular map.
[0:50:19] <$QueequegTheater> Just see faster
[0:50:20] <kozboz96> @AngriestPat thanks for getting me into ff14 doing my lower classes rn and why does black mage suck so much
[0:50:21] <+RogueInfinity> Fair
[0:50:21] <%SoFarFetched> Don't be a pussy and leave.
[0:50:22] <zenith0111> GET CYBORG EYES
[0:50:23] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat I'd be fine with that
[0:50:23] <+BringBackSempai> doesn't your cheat app give you a bread and butter for each matchup?
[0:50:23] <+drawminomicon> touche
[0:50:23] <suikudo> You joke but that may be for the best
[0:50:24] <+Jekado> high armor won't do shit against and AP champ
[0:50:24] <%SoFarFetched> KEEP AT IT
[0:50:25] <KattyCitty> some items are for different champs or game modes
[0:50:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> that would work out
[0:50:26] <freezydude> UPGRADE YOUR EYES
[0:50:27] <ape_hawk> 3rd option: research the items first
[0:50:28] <cham52> no monitors laying around?
[0:50:29] <waterstealer> you might as well not play at all
[0:50:30] <$QueequegTheater> Kee pat it
[0:50:30] <%fatally_furious> sounds like a plan Kappa
[0:50:30] <+BringBackSempai> for items
[0:50:31] <+Jekado> I think thats a good option is to not playing
[0:50:32] <Monkey_D_Judd> YAAAAAY
[0:50:32] <93lobo> some of these items are for other game modez
[0:50:33] <+Valison> Pat don't threaten your chat with a good time
[0:50:36] <Damie904> @AngriestPat You'll learn items over time, but since most endgame items are comprised of smaller items, it helps if you go first for items that are more suited to the match.
[0:50:38] <PowerfulBlackGangs> His Vision Is Augmented
[0:50:39] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat just play Nasus
[0:50:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> get glasses you coward
[0:50:40] <koolaid_kevster> yeh stop playing lol
[0:50:40] <ShadeTheNovice> Just get cyborg eyes that allow you to zoom
[0:50:42] <+MinimumPayne> there could be a cheat sheet app to browse on ur phone
[0:50:42] <+Jekado> You lose 0% of the games you don't play
[0:50:42] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Items are SO SITUATIONAL, that sticking to the same build path every time is gonna HURT
[0:50:42] <%nmaten> after you learn the items youll be fine
[0:50:42] <FeelsBadPat> LUL
[0:50:43] <%wsintai> Singed is fucking great
[0:50:43] <+ojama1987> if i were you i would honestly not worry too much about the items at this stage. Suggested builds will keep you right
[0:50:45] <+anhero64> who've you played as?
[0:50:45] <%GingaNZ> god I love singed
[0:50:46] <%Mekhet09> Spend time learning the items.
[0:50:46] <universaldove> Is that meant to be a total biscuit of rejuvenation or something?
[0:50:46] <zenith0111> Toxic ^ Kappa
[0:50:47] <freezydude> Pat knows about singed?
[0:50:47] <Tunykun> Like, you dont really need to learn items unless you play ranked imo.
[0:50:48] <%SashaStarshine> Teemo is crazy toxic, btw you should buy Teemo
[0:50:49] <freezydude> OH YEAAAH
[0:50:49] <leonegaming6> anal bead Kappa
[0:50:51] <zecht89> i'd say decrease the resolution if you can't read
[0:50:51] <freezydude> LOVE THAT BOI
[0:50:53] <honestintroversion> get glasses old man
[0:50:53] <hntronium> If you can't read then you probably really might want to not play the game at all
[0:50:54] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> @AngriestPat You could apply for a job a Riot and change the font yourself
[0:50:55] <%SilentEric> It'll be fine, just know of your items you tend to buy
[0:50:56] <%arcaderabbit48> @BringBackSempai Yes, but its not perfect and can't account for everything. It gives you a generalized idea, but not specifics
[0:50:57] <hntronium> Items are important
[0:51:00] <+arancet> @AngriestPat singed is a tank that trolls the enemy, just your type
[0:51:00] <+Baekon01> it refills
[0:51:09] <%WritebroAlpha> CHECK BOOT UPGRADES
[0:51:10] <Zedimonx5> Get some eye cybernetics 4head
[0:51:10] <AMajorTom> It's okay if some people on a team don't know how to play, as long as you have fun.
[0:51:11] <+BringBackSempai> just pick them at random
[0:51:11] <Forester_Skippy> just keep doing what your doing for now blitz helps to get into it and after a while you can see if you need to take a difrent item path once you ge tthe hang of items and how a game goes dont worry
[0:51:14] <93lobo> click the items pat
[0:51:14] <%WritebroAlpha> THEY'RE SUPER IMPORTANT
[0:51:16] <freezydude> Hey pat your boots are situational
[0:51:18] <$QueequegTheater> GOBLINS
[0:51:19] <%NSwarmlord> Do you know the difference between armor and magic resist?
[0:51:23] <%dasmause> apatGoblin
[0:51:23] <darkmind95> Potions are for LATE GAME
[0:51:24] <zenith0111> Takes league too seriously ^ Kappa
[0:51:25] <leonegaming6> you buy them if you hit full build
[0:51:26] <shiny_prinny> just buy a refillable instead
[0:51:27] <%SilentEric> Potions are for end of game when your build is done
[0:51:28] <vingadivo> pat dong stand and atack minons until they die, wait for until they're low health and then atack for a last hit
[0:51:28] <%SashaStarshine> You can buy a refilling potion for 150 gold Pat
[0:51:28] <%Deadbulky> Then buy refilable only
[0:51:29] <shinji_ifrit> potions are for late game when you have everything else
[0:51:29] <%mh9s> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[0:51:31] <%kyh9> They're useful when you've bought all your items
[0:51:32] <vampireinarm> has Pat figured out items yet
[0:51:32] <ShadeTheNovice> Dont use potions, you will probably never need them
[0:51:33] <%nmaten> build into on the bottom
[0:51:34] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Refillable refill for free tho
[0:51:36] <Finchit> you see their buld path
[0:51:36] <Tressing> Have you tried jungling?
[0:51:36] <+BringBackSempai> pick the items based on how hype the icon art gets you
[0:51:36] <+MisterRockett> Then get the one that refreshes when you go back to base.
[0:51:38] <+xddddsorandom> You get them when you have full items
[0:51:40] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Maybe keep item descriptions handy on your phone nearby?
[0:51:43] <HellBIood> @AngriestPat hey pat got any champs you really like so far?
[0:51:44] <pectusumbra> But if your potions get you a kill it's like it's like free money
[0:51:47] <Vyskus> Vyskus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I'm here for the sweet sweet salt
[0:51:47] <93lobo> to see what they build into
[0:51:47] <+xddddsorandom> That's really the only time
[0:51:48] <%Who_lio42> you use them to not die and thus deny them money
[0:51:48] <Vyskus> Vyskus's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:51:48] <+RogueInfinity> @AngriestPat I think the items you should learn about now are the ones that situational i.e. Mortal Reminder and Adaptive Helm
[0:51:49] <+BringBackSempai> then look up how to optimize your hype build
[0:51:50] <Finchit> you see what the items turn into
[0:51:50] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat those special potions are more for when you're full build and need that much more extra stats
[0:51:52] <+SlightlySychotic> Pat you have to buy potions.
[0:51:53] <%nmaten> the cheaper items are components of more powerful items
[0:51:55] <%WritebroAlpha> Clicking the items shows what other items they build into
[0:51:55] <+Jekado> problem with us giving him advise is the too many cooks thing
[0:51:56] <honestintroversion> Get some Adam Jenson cybernetic eye implants to you can see better
[0:51:56] <COMB711> what you can do is just remember what the base pieces like chain mail do, and then know that anything that builds out of it will have thosee stats at least
[0:51:57] <zenith0111> rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD rmzREAD
[0:51:57] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat There's an option in-game to set the shop to one with text on display. When you get in a match, look right of the search bar in the shop menu.
[0:52:00] <shiny_prinny> the items that popped up are what that builds into
[0:52:00] <Darkmega97> why use a potion now? you might need it for a next game
[0:52:01] <+Jekado> we are giving him to much info
[0:52:01] <+arancet> shows what makes it and what it is used to make
[0:52:05] <FeelsBadPat> Its showing you the pokemon evolution chart
[0:52:07] <KattyCitty> show you what they build into and out of!
[0:52:08] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat So like you should just learn what the items on a wiki.
[0:52:09] <%qazwsxedc168> lmao
[0:52:11] <%Deadbulky> LUL Smol indie compo
[0:52:13] <+drawminomicon> Client is glitched right now
[0:52:13] <Finchit> LUL
[0:52:13] <universaldove> Pat would probably like Corrupting Potion...that's still in the game, right?
[0:52:15] <Ralamar> Riot's client is the worst
[0:52:16] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[0:52:16] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, just look up Nasus for an easy game
[0:52:17] <freezydude> Hey pat your boots on that item set for core items are specifically anti magic and anti disables
[0:52:19] <%rj1771> Fix yo shit, Rito!
[0:52:20] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:52:21] <%Typhaeon> Good job on your busted game client Rito
[0:52:21] <+Cymen90> RITO LUL
[0:52:26] <+anhero64> pat who've you played my dude?
[0:52:26] <shiny_prinny> rito pls
[0:52:27] <shinji_ifrit> smol indie company
[0:52:28] <%Josef_Stryker> apatDab
[0:52:28] <+RogueInfinity> Rito games
[0:52:29] <%SilentEric> This item thing is so outdated.
[0:52:30] <Zelretch3000> SMALL INDIE COMPAGNY
[0:52:31] <vingadivo> PAT dont try and learn the cheaper itens there are too many, just learn the really expensive ones they're the ones that matter
[0:52:32] <+VanaSkiller> RITO LUL
[0:52:33] <xxMylord> imagine not learning Dota 2 instead
[0:52:33] <+arancet> client has never been great, theres always an issue like that
[0:52:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh yeah, the client is will always be fucked
[0:52:36] <+Malevalent> @AngriestPat yeah, the league client has kinda always sucked, even after getting new ones
[0:52:37] <KattyCitty> small infie company
[0:52:38] <93lobo> Pat there are phone apps for this too
[0:52:41] <%bevyrage> nasus is only an easy game if you're good at last hitting, and dealing with bullying enemies as a melee
[0:52:42] <Forester_Skippy> dont worry ever other week there is something bugged i nthis game you will get used to it
[0:52:45] <+Cymen90> You are learning that RIOT is bad at making shit
[0:52:45] <zayasu> use this *** @AngriestPat
[0:52:47] <+boredpantz> Has Pat fought an Irelia yet?
[0:52:47] <%SilentEric> No bully, Rito is a small indie company
[0:52:47] <%AncelDeLambert> if it makes you feel better, Pat, trying to do your own build this early on will only fuck you
[0:52:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat I've noticed it does that with other things, but those are usually not gameplay related
[0:52:50] <simulationbard> League's client sucks in other news sky, blue
[0:52:51] <Jarvanii> the client used to be even worse
[0:52:53] <ralphfromdk> That's rito for you, bugged game, even more broken client :D
[0:52:53] <+mgskomododragon> The main thing that helped me was pick a champ i like and youtube other people defining how to play them. you keep doing you
[0:52:55] <+Jekado> cool down reduction doesn't stack right?
[0:52:57] <%AncelDeLambert> you just DON'T know enough about the game to make a custom build
[0:52:57] <%SashaStarshine> Pat you can afford to buy Teemo 8 times right now, and yet you haven't even bought him once.
[0:52:59] <+Jekado> still just the highest?
[0:52:59] <+korean_random> it's fiiiiine
[0:53:04] <%SilentEric> That'll be fine.
[0:53:05] <freezydude> @Jekado CDR still stacks
[0:53:08] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, worrying about it now is a little too much
[0:53:09] <+Jekado> same with boots base speed?
[0:53:09] <%WritebroAlpha> TAKE THE FIRST STEP BY LEARNING ABOUT BOOT UPGRADES
[0:53:10] <+MinimumPayne> yeah thats research you can do on your own time
[0:53:10] <freezydude> @Jekado the caps 40%
[0:53:11] <zenith0111> Just grind out those matches Kappa
[0:53:12] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, that's a lotta blue, Pat
[0:53:12] <Tunykun> yeah, thats my opinion on items too. just learn how to play first.
[0:53:13] <%Deadbulky> Yeah its fine just following the ingame options for now
[0:53:14] <%TrebassStream> Bro buy a champion
[0:53:19] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Maybe keep item descriptions handy on your phone nearby?
[0:53:19] <shiny_prinny> its easier to just use the recommended items anyways
[0:53:20] <%GingaNZ> if you are playing darius read what the hammer and triforce do
[0:53:21] <+Jekado> OH right thats what it was
[0:53:23] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, you can do that for LEague
[0:53:23] <+boredpantz> Pat buy Teemo buddy
[0:53:24] <%SashaStarshine> Teemo!
[0:53:25] <+ojama1987> youll finds there will come a time, should you keep playing, that youll just learn items over time passively
[0:53:26] <+Jekado> sorry i thought it was just one
[0:53:27] <+MinimumPayne> if youre buying in that much
[0:53:27] <%Freakin_Wolfy> buy nasus
[0:53:27] <Finchit> people need to calm down on coaching pat. he doesnt know what he doesnt know. he's doing fine
[0:53:27] <kryedge> Have you tried Teemo? It´s right up your alley, it´´´s infuriating for your adversaries and he doesn´t have skillshots
[0:53:28] <%SilentEric> Just be careful for items with active abilities you have to actually activate like an ability
[0:53:29] <+RogueInfinity> HotS is dead now tho
[0:53:30] <$povertysenpai> what rank were you
[0:53:31] <+Jekado> TEEMOOO
[0:53:33] <leonegaming6> i feel like thats the problem these days. people dont learn on there own anymore
[0:53:34] <$povertysenpai> in hots that is
[0:53:34] <ape_hawk> pat, maybe support is more your niche
[0:53:35] <%TweetHeart> Berserker Grieves or bust
[0:53:35] <stanlychicken> Pat buy a chap you wont like
[0:53:36] <%Typhaeon> "We have champions at home"
[0:53:38] <bleugh> whens the lol fighter coming out
[0:53:39] <koolaid_kevster> @angriestpat dont blame everyone else for your short Cummings you got on the ball late no one to blame besides yourself
[0:53:40] <%SashaStarshine> T E E M O
[0:53:41] <vingadivo> pat try and learn only the really expensive itens instead of the cheap ones, the cheap ones are too many and dont matter as much
[0:53:42] <+Jekado> level 19 tho
[0:53:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> yeah but you will fucking read a entire guide before creating a character on a rpg
[0:53:42] <ezl0ck> teemo top is fun
[0:53:42] <%ItsSansom> Play ARAM if you want to learn new champs
[0:53:43] <+boredpantz> Pat Teemo is learn as the Demon of toplane
[0:53:44] <%TrebassStream> We have champs at home
[0:53:45] <Palmer_Huntaway> just have fun with the game
[0:53:47] <Tunykun> play thresh or blitz and become a hooker
[0:53:48] <+drawminomicon> lol hes level 19.
[0:53:48] <KattyCitty> get you an EXPENSIVE champion
[0:53:49] <+Jekado> he can play ranked at 20?
[0:53:51] <Palmer_Huntaway> and play whoever
[0:53:51] <KattyCitty> they're more power
[0:53:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Be on the lookout for usable items, tho. If you buy those and not use them, might as well not buy them.
[0:53:53] <+arancet> teemo is a troll, but a sqiushy one, singed in a tanky troll
[0:53:53] <%Mekhet09> 30
[0:53:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> I believe in the power of yooou
[0:53:55] <+BringBackSempai> dva was great to troll people in hots
[0:53:56] <$povertysenpai> i meant for hots :(
[0:53:56] <%Mekhet09> But he shouldn't.
[0:53:56] <zenith0111> Play that champion that appears in all those creepy porn vids Kappa
[0:53:58] <+drawminomicon> level 30 for ranked
[0:54:01] <+mgskomododragon> buying all the champions is just to help when trading people and first picking.
[0:54:02] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Quit listening to us, we're fucking stupid
[0:54:06] <+BringBackSempai> just bully people by knocking them around
[0:54:09] <%arcaderabbit48> @zenith0111 Which one??
[0:54:15] <zecht89> Sion is the most fun you'll have in this game, choo choo motherfucker
[0:54:16] <Rhinoprotoss> Coward
[0:54:18] <%SilentEric> I can't wait for Pat to play Qiyana or Yuumi
[0:54:21] <kryedge> Teemo is YOUR champion, he´s small, infuriating and doesn´t have skillshots
[0:54:21] <zenith0111> @arcaderabbit48 Exactly LUL
[0:54:22] <+Jekado> i think turning chat off is kinda a bad idea sometimes
[0:54:22] <Iggeh0> hello
[0:54:23] <freezydude> I cant believe Pat plays support its so out of character
[0:54:23] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatOrange
[0:54:24] <+Vegaburd> No! keep the chat
[0:54:26] <%nmaten> pat thats not how that works
[0:54:26] <+drawminomicon> @arcaderabbit48 The good ones
[0:54:26] <+Jekado> because they can't warn you
[0:54:26] <ape_hawk> sniper no sniping!
[0:54:27] <%Deadbulky> Target locked
[0:54:29] <+RogueInfinity> Sniping
[0:54:29] <%SoFarFetched> SNIPER NO SNIPING,SNIPER NO SNIPING
[0:54:29] <leonegaming6> sniping pat right now EZ Clap
[0:54:30] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, you need to play Nasus for relaxing gameplay
[0:54:30] <+Audega> WATCH HIS HAND
[0:54:30] <ofloofy> snipe you said ? Kappa
[0:54:30] <KattyCitty> try u some aram, learn on the FLY
[0:54:31] <+Vegaburd> just turn on profanity filter
[0:54:33] <shinji_ifrit> makes me wanna snipe
[0:54:34] <KattyCitty> BETTER LEARN QUICK
[0:54:34] <Explodincatz> sniper no sniping
[0:54:39] <+Valison> What's that? Snipe you?
[0:54:43] <Rhinoprotoss> You can just mute the person
[0:54:43] <%nmaten> chat filter my friend
[0:54:43] <Forester_Skippy> imma snipe you from a difrent server
[0:54:44] <Tunykun> nah man. you dont need chat lol
[0:54:45] <+Jekado> yeah understandable
[0:54:45] <ape_hawk> isnt there a filter?
[0:54:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat there's a profanity filter
[0:54:46] <leonegaming6> language filter
[0:54:47] <+arancet> theres a language filter
[0:54:47] <Angry_Ev1L> nobody would do that pat
[0:54:47] <+Vegaburd> but the filter tho
[0:54:48] <+ojama1987> language filter
[0:54:50] <shevan123> non hard r's please and thank you
[0:54:51] <freezydude> There's a language filter
[0:54:54] <+D00msDayDan> @Rhinoprotoss yeah, after they drop it
[0:54:56] <%Mekhet09> There's a language filter.
[0:54:57] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat you can turn on chat filter, it would look like, "**********"
[0:54:57] <+Jekado> i wouldn't depend on it
[0:54:58] <Zelretch3000> lol
[0:55:00] <zenith0111> Please no filter chat wtf
[0:55:00] <Frodiddly> this is wise
[0:55:00] <%GarbageNirvana> People find ways around it
[0:55:01] <+arancet> fair enough
[0:55:01] <%Verd_254> There is
[0:55:02] <Srthunda> Language filter is bad anyway
[0:55:02] <%Deadbulky> apatSmug
[0:55:03] <universaldove> Isn't there a language filter?
[0:55:03] <Angry_Ev1L> STOP BEING A COWARD
[0:55:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Wise
[0:55:05] <Forester_Skippy> you know how easy it is to ge tpast the filter?
[0:55:06] <%mh9s> oof
[0:55:07] <+Vegaburd> theyll find creative ways to drop the n-bomb
[0:55:08] <shiny_prinny> language filter isn't foolproof
[0:55:08] <Tressing> chat has a filter
[0:55:08] <%wujak> you could leave chat on for you and cover it in the stream layout like you have done in ffxiv
[0:55:08] <+MinimumPayne> hed have to mute them after saying the n word
[0:55:08] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Chumps always go around filters. That's how it goes.
[0:55:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat is smart confirmed
[0:55:11] <+Jekado> you just loose some teamwork and map awareness which is big later on
[0:55:11] <%SilentEric> Better not to risk it
[0:55:11] <%LaughingCatt> smart move
[0:55:12] <Forester_Skippy> its really easy
[0:55:12] <mankeyfigh> IS THERE NOT A FILTERRR
[0:55:13] <pectusumbra> You know what? That's fair
[0:55:14] <%WritebroAlpha> Pat please look into boot upgrades, they're the bigges thing in simplicity to effectiveness ratio
[0:55:14] <+mgskomododragon> all chat is useless anyway
[0:55:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> We can't all be Randy Orton
[0:55:15] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> smrt
[0:55:15] <%WhereIsWill> very wise tbh
[0:55:16] <+korean_random> but that's like half the fun
[0:55:17] <Aydarkzero> nobody gets fun!
[0:55:17] <kryedge> Teemo is YOUR champion, he´s small, infuriating and doesn´t have skillshots
[0:55:18] <%Madbearv> this is how he makes his living and if someone has a heated gamer moment then he could lose everything
[0:55:18] <%ToadKing> chat will have a way around the filter
[0:55:18] <+AuHunter> Time to switch to Mixer then hahaha
[0:55:19] <%Verd_254> cover it with your camera
[0:55:20] <RAH001> lol just mute them fuckos pat says
[0:55:20] <Jarvanii> but any dialogue in a game is someone elses text really
[0:55:21] <+Malevalent> @AngriestPat so how are you enjoying league so far?
[0:55:21] <+Peacockney> @AngriestPat What's a good Monster flavor? The normal one tastes like poop
[0:55:22] <+Audega> They'll just find new, creative ways to spell the n word
[0:55:23] <Tunykun> even with filter, you can write something like w[i]ggger anyway lol
[0:55:23] <+MinimumPayne> easier to preempt them
[0:55:23] <+Jekado> but i think they have a system where you can do normal warnings like in HOTS
[0:55:28] <%TweetHeart> is Dota's disable all incoming messages similar to turning the whole chat off?
[0:55:29] <ItsMarchii> @AngriestPat You see that new champion tho? he's just Dante
[0:55:30] <+2DSuperiority> do it like XIV and cover chat?
[0:55:31] <%arcaderabbit48> There's a language filter, but there are plenty of ways around it. Don't forget KYS, be Kind to Your Self!
[0:55:31] <%Typhaeon> Just risk your entire livelihood over someone else's inability to control themselves & Twitch's arbitrary mods Kappa
[0:55:35] <+anhero64> would you tell me of the champs you've played so far?
[0:55:39] <%nmaten> it comes with time honestly
[0:55:41] <koolaid_kevster> well dont play league
[0:55:42] <freezydude> I bet there's a mobile app for this shit
[0:55:42] <%Madbearv> Like
[0:55:43] <ape_hawk> look up tutorials on youtube
[0:55:43] <Tressing> Pings are better for communication
[0:55:45] <ne_zha> Imagine him learning Dota items LUL
[0:55:45] <koolaid_kevster> ever
[0:55:46] <waterstealer> you look them up on the wiki
[0:55:47] <zenith0111> YouTube and Research Kappa
[0:55:48] <+drawminomicon> There is. Play on a moniter
[0:55:48] <freezydude> Look up the items on the wiki or some shit.
[0:55:48] <Mrbaconator> it's genuinely a time thing
[0:55:51] <Div_the_Penguin> focus only on items at the top of each tree
[0:55:51] <%qazwsxedc168> ull get used to it from playing
[0:55:55] <Hellarussian> there sure are
[0:55:57] <+korean_random> @AngriestPat doesn't matter what items you pick if don't kill creeps to get gold to buy them
[0:55:59] <%Madbearv> I guess he could do something with the overlay but even then
[0:55:59] <chester804> wish there was a way to learn items... you cant fucking read them man!
[0:56:00] <%Mekhet09> There's a wiki for every item and a break down of how it works.
[0:56:00] <Rhinoprotoss> You don't
[0:56:00] <AtomicXIII> Almost all of league you learn through trial and error. It will take a long ass time
[0:56:01] <Calek> look up builds
[0:56:02] <%kyh9> No
[0:56:02] <%WhereIsWill> sooo many
[0:56:03] <NachoCanDandyRavage> isn't there a wiki where you can look at these as well? Plus only thr final one matter
[0:56:03] <+Jekado> is mordekaiser still number one HUEHUEHUE?!?
[0:56:03] <kryedge> no
[0:56:03] <%arcaderabbit48> There are a lot of items, and many of them are quite niches
[0:56:03] <freezydude> Pat there are categories
[0:56:04] <%WritebroAlpha> NO
[0:56:04] <mankeyfigh> Isn’t CHAT important for team communication CHAT
[0:56:05] <Tressing> Takes time my dude..
[0:56:05] <leonegaming6> @AngriestPat dont worry about it man. it will all fall into place with time.
[0:56:05] <stoccton> not really
[0:56:06] <NachoCanDandyRavage> no
[0:56:06] <%AncelDeLambert> most
[0:56:06] <Mrbaconator> yes pretty much
[0:56:06] <@BigNaturalMan59> nah
[0:56:06] <+froduck42> not really
[0:56:07] <shinji_ifrit> not learn
[0:56:07] <freezydude> Pat.
[0:56:07] <ThirdPersonPhil> just scrub trough a app while you are dead
[0:56:07] <%WritebroAlpha> NO YOU DON'T
[0:56:07] <Hellarussian> most of them not all
[0:56:07] <%TrebassStream> Pat what helped me was dividing the items up into small items and large items; the large items have big good effects and that should cut your reading down in half
[0:56:08] <%Deadbulky> Not reall just the ones that matter
[0:56:08] <%Who_lio42> ehh learn most of them
[0:56:08] <%Solidus_113> you don't
[0:56:09] <%SashaStarshine> Like half of those are leftovers from weird shit
[0:56:09] <vingadivo> pat dont try to learn the item components just the main itens that are the expensive ones
[0:56:09] <Forester_Skippy> the problem for you is the text is really small because the shop has filters
[0:56:09] <+Glock3bb> You can also go into a custom bot match or training mod and fool around.
[0:56:10] <shinji_ifrit> just read
[0:56:10] <%kyh9> You just search them up by the stat you want
[0:56:10] <ReDexuz> no
[0:56:10] <Jeexx> Just the ones your champion can make use of eluRk
[0:56:10] <freezydude> there are categories on the side.
[0:56:11] <Angry_Ev1L> I thought you have a cheat app
[0:56:12] <Swedish_Expert> no
[0:56:14] <kryedge> you´ll learn them trough osmosis
[0:56:14] <MyNameIsRasus> No
[0:56:14] <alastorpayne> only the ones u build lol
[0:56:15] <NachoCanDandyRavage> only the final ones
[0:56:15] <+MinimumPayne> its hard especially if its just you jumping in
[0:56:16] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Not all, but your build stuff
[0:56:17] <ReDexuz> just read in matcj
[0:56:17] <theKingRamses> you can learn what stats are more important to you, which lets you filter out ones that aren't so great
[0:56:20] <zecht89> honestly, you'll only learn them by actually having built them
[0:56:21] <+Vegaburd> Just give it 3 years youll get there
[0:56:21] <%Solidus_113> you just learn the ones that are your role
[0:56:23] <Hellarussian> y - yeah
[0:56:23] <+arancet> its yes and no
[0:56:23] <zenith0111> You just need to learn the bad ones Jebaited
[0:56:26] <%SilentEric> Can you make it so only Summoner's Rift items show up?
[0:56:27] <TwinBat> maybe
[0:56:27] <KattyCitty> best way to think about it is to think of it as "components" "mid-tier" and "completed"
[0:56:28] <%TG_Cid11> you just need to learn items you need for your hero
[0:56:29] <simulationbard> You'll learn them eventually either way
[0:56:29] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, you've got to look up Nasus
[0:56:30] <AhmCha> Wait one of those items you're looking at isn't even in the game anymore?
[0:56:30] <%WritebroAlpha> You need to learn the 30% or so that matter for your champion
[0:56:30] <Finchit> chat is untrustworthy bruh
[0:56:31] <93lobo> Pat some of these are on other game moded
[0:56:31] <freezydude> Pat they're literally on the side tho
[0:56:32] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a dense fucking game people, come on
[0:56:32] <+eanscrale> This is why I like fighting games
[0:56:32] <+MinimumPayne> usually people learn with buddies who already know the game
[0:56:32] <ReDexuz> nobody knows them all
[0:56:33] <%LaughingCatt> Crazy Talk Act II
[0:56:33] <$povertysenpai> its not that hard trust me
[0:56:35] <ahegotrigger> the true final boss is learning all the champions
[0:56:35] <Witchtaker> dont learn the ones that suck just the cool ones
[0:56:35] <FeelsBadPat> it literally will become second nature
[0:56:36] <Tressing> nah.. just two or three per role
[0:56:36] <freezydude> like there's categories
[0:56:36] <+eanscrale> none of this crap
[0:56:37] <+Jekado> why i like HOTS no items
[0:56:37] <Palmer_Huntaway> yeah there are a lot of items
[0:56:39] <%Reevesypoo> Some of the items on that list aren't even in summoners rift lol
[0:56:39] <shiny_prinny> usually, you use the recommended items until you learn how items can counteract enemies
[0:56:40] <AhmCha> Why is Spear of Shojin even there?
[0:56:40] <ItsAGundamu> waynerWhack waynerWhack waynerWhack waynerWhack lytJACKPOT
[0:56:40] <+MinimumPayne> kinda like a jedi padawan relationship
[0:56:40] <%Deadbulky> You only need to learn the ones for ur champs/role
[0:56:41] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat it's less about knowing each item in the game, and more knowing shorthand elements like which items give AP, AD, CDR, or specific abilities
[0:56:43] <leonegaming6> @ReDexuz i do
[0:56:43] <koolaid_kevster> no you dont stop complaining
[0:56:43] <flyingtentaclemonster> yeah you do lol
[0:56:43] <freezydude> It's a highly offensive item
[0:56:44] <%AncelDeLambert> you want to be good at your ROLE, or at the game?
[0:56:44] <%The_Baaz> Crazy Talk Act III
[0:56:45] <NachoCanDandyRavage> backseat gaming gang
[0:56:45] <%arcaderabbit48> Small tip, people saying No are the people that aren't very good...
[0:56:45] <+Cymen90> @AngriestPat An ocean of BADS and you will never know who is floating above.
[0:56:45] <%nmaten> good stats but hella expensive
[0:56:47] <+Jekado> its like a general buff item
[0:56:49] <AtomicXIII> Pat find someone high elo, and just listen to them haha
[0:56:49] <freezydude> it's like a luxury offensive item lol
[0:56:50] <BlackermanZX> So hows pat doin'
[0:56:50] <Imsoverylazy> Not gonna lie, you need to know at what they all more or less do, but you don't really need to know the exact numbers yet
[0:56:51] <%Conraderino45> Pat
[0:56:52] <darkmind95> That List is broken!
[0:56:53] <+textandnumbers> Eh, you just slowly absorb all the info as you play over time.
[0:56:53] <Arek_1> Chat is a bitch. Trust me. LUL
[0:56:54] <Div_the_Penguin> Most of them are just there as a component for other item
[0:56:54] <@BigNaturalMan59> this is how you learn: play a game, hey that dude did alot of damage, how do i do that? get the item he got, oh deathcap is cool
[0:56:56] <+MisterRockett> There's an item that REVIVES you from death.
[0:56:57] <shiny_prinny> now look at black cleaver
[0:56:58] <AMajorTom> Just learn and memorize everything about 1 item per day, and in no time, you'll be there
[0:56:59] <Rhinoprotoss> ..
[0:57:00] <zenith0111> 40% Attack Speed?!
[0:57:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat It comes with time as you play certain champions. For the most part, Juggernauts like Garen and Darius build the same so you just kinda get used to building that type of character.
[0:57:01] <+Malevalent> @AngriestPat really learning core items are the best vs situational items. darius for example has a core of a black cleaver, but some items after are situational aka the tank items
[0:57:03] <Imsoverylazy> Tri-Force is a lot of damage
[0:57:04] <+Jam_Jam> Do you know the difference between AD and AP
[0:57:05] <93lobo> Darius can also take that item
[0:57:06] <SenranKaguraWeeb> Most people who play this game still have played it for 6-7 years expert so stupid assumptions
[0:57:06] <+arancet> its an all rounder item, bit of everything
[0:57:07] <%nmaten> look at black cleaver now
[0:57:07] <ScrubTheNerd> People wanted you to know about spellblade
[0:57:08] <KattyCitty> LOTS OF DAMAGE
[0:57:08] <%AncelDeLambert> to know it has a cooldown on doing extra damage
[0:57:09] <Jeexx> Tons of damage astrovrAYAYA8
[0:57:09] <kryedge> Hey, never buy a skin, once you break the seal you´ll go insane and buy a ton of shit like everyone
[0:57:10] <%Conraderino45> Im gonna drop some of my 5000 hour knowlegde on you
[0:57:10] <%Deadbulky> Alotta damage
[0:57:10] <%NSwarmlord> Search for black cleaver
[0:57:11] <%nmaten> thats the alternative for darius
[0:57:15] <Imsoverylazy> BIG NUMBER
[0:57:15] <%WritebroAlpha> TONS OF DAMAGE
[0:57:17] <koolaid_kevster> @angriestpat the game is 10 years only wtf do you expect
[0:57:17] <%SilentEric> Knowing about the bonus damage after abilities is important
[0:57:18] <+MinimumPayne> red and yellow items are usually attack dmg
[0:57:20] <%Mekhet09> Because triforce is damage but blackcleaver can be better.
[0:57:22] <MyNameIsRasus> BIGGEST NUMBER
[0:57:23] <leonegaming6> LUL
[0:57:24] <%nmaten> oh boy
[0:57:25] <+MinimumPayne> purple and blue are usually ap
[0:57:25] <+drawminomicon> Just know what the stats do. Dont worry about bonus effects until later.
[0:57:25] <%WhereIsWill> tri force is apatBig good
[0:57:26] <freezydude> OH GOD
[0:57:27] <%qazwsxedc168> thats correct
[0:57:27] <stoccton> good job pat
[0:57:27] <+Jekado> big brain pat
[0:57:28] <+Dr_Mooose> there you go
[0:57:28] <shinji_ifrit> ad is physical ap is magic
[0:57:28] <ape_hawk> AP: Ability Power
[0:57:28] <%Who_lio42> ohhh boy
[0:57:29] <%TweetHeart> Close enough
[0:57:30] <darkmind95> LUL LUL
[0:57:30] <+arancet> AD is phys damage, AP is magic
[0:57:31] <Rhinoprotoss> Mega ignore
[0:57:32] <+Audega> AP is Ability Damage, AD is regular damage
[0:57:32] <+korean_random> 5Head
[0:57:32] <freezydude> AD is attack damage.
[0:57:33] <NJigglypuff> i hated learning the difference
[0:57:33] <Arek_1> LUL
[0:57:33] <Imsoverylazy> ATTACK DAMAGE & ABILITY POWER
[0:57:33] <JoelFleran> ad physical ap magic
[0:57:33] <lokiluko> he's played 50ish matches?
[0:57:34] <%kyh9> AD affects your auto-attack damage, AP primarily affects your abilities
[0:57:34] <TundraOW> IT's DO COMBO vs BIG NUMBER
[0:57:34] <POCKETSANDX> how long has the stream been going?
[0:57:35] <freezydude> AP is ability power.
[0:57:36] <alastorpayne> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:57:36] <zenith0111> I don't even play this game and i can tell you Tri Force is amazing
[0:57:36] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> He's not wrong
[0:57:36] <Fantomghosthoe> ill show you a d and a p at the same time
[0:57:37] <ape_hawk> AD: Attack Damage
[0:57:39] <Tressing> Read BLOODTHIRSTER
[0:57:39] <+Audega> No no
[0:57:40] <+drawminomicon> IT IS
[0:57:40] <kryedge> Some skills stack with AD others with AP, depends on the champion
[0:57:41] <NachoCanDandyRavage> AttackDamage and Ability Power
[0:57:41] <Mendin> The advice I got as a new player was to stick to recommended items until you know enough to know why you should deviate from the recommended
[0:57:42] <simulationbard> Attack Damage vs Ability Power
[0:57:42] <%kyh9> AD affects your auto-attack
[0:57:43] <+Audega> AD is basic attacks
[0:57:43] <MyNameIsRasus> AD is hitting things, AP is magic shit
[0:57:44] <+arancet> cuz they dumb
[0:57:44] <Rhinoprotoss> Attack and ability
[0:57:44] <Forester_Skippy> videogames shut up
[0:57:44] <%AncelDeLambert> it ISSSSSS
[0:57:44] <%NSwarmlord> Because it's more complicated than that
[0:57:45] <%WritebroAlpha> Attack Power and Ability Power
[0:57:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> BECAUSE ITS DUMB
[0:57:45] <darkmind95> Because they are not the same!
[0:57:45] <+Audega> AP is abilities
[0:57:46] <%skizzuto> because mobas are dumb
[0:57:46] <%LaughingCatt> because ????
[0:57:46] <KattyCitty> ad scales on the abilities when it red, ap scales when it green
[0:57:47] <Div_the_Penguin> one focuses on normal attacks and one focuses on abilities
[0:57:48] <$povertysenpai> attack damage vs ability power
[0:57:48] <ReDexuz> no
[0:57:49] <%bevyrage> because they don't always scale to magic or physical
[0:57:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Because DOTACraft!
[0:57:51] <Imsoverylazy> AD IS ATTACK DAMAGE, AP IS ABILITY POWER
[0:57:51] <%nmaten> cause thats not a good description of what they actually are
[0:57:52] <pectusumbra> it's ability power because not everyone does M A G I C
[0:57:52] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> for eleitism
[0:57:53] <kryedge> it´s NOT always physical and magic
[0:57:53] <%SilentEric> If you mouse over your ability in game, if it is BLUE that means AP. If you if it is RED that means AD
[0:57:55] <Imsoverylazy> NO
[0:57:55] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> uh no
[0:57:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Attack Damage, and Ability Points
[0:57:56] <+Jekado> its like in HOTS has normal attack and Abilty power
[0:57:56] <darkmind95> NO!
[0:57:56] <%Deadbulky> Passives are unique @AngriestPatSO cleaver and tri force cannot be used on the samage champ as u wouldnt get both passive procs
[0:57:56] <%wujak> not true
[0:57:56] <%Mekhet09> Because then it'd be DOTA 2
[0:57:56] <%TweetHeart> because a lot of abilities can't decide if they go off AD or AP, unlike Hots
[0:57:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> NO
[0:57:57] <Arek_1> Because that would be useful. LUL
[0:57:58] <shiny_prinny> NO
[0:57:58] <%nmaten> some abilites scale with ad
[0:57:58] <ne_zha> NO!
[0:57:58] <%Shadowthedigger> AP affects ap champ
[0:57:58] <+drawminomicon> AD = Attack damage AP = Ability power
[0:57:59] <pectusumbra> also some abilities do use AD
[0:57:59] <+rittzler> THATS NOT TRIUE WHJAT
[0:57:59] <stanlychicken> No
[0:57:59] <%WhereIsWill> because SHUT UP LUL
[0:57:59] <+anhero64> some abilities scale with ad
[0:58:00] <kryedge> that´s NOT true
[0:58:00] <ThirdPersonPhil> cause character variety there is punch wizards in the game
[0:58:00] <+boredpantz> @AngriestPat PAT THATS WRONG
[0:58:00] <+Monkeydude07> That's wrong lol
[0:58:00] <ItsAGundamu> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:58:00] <VaudevilleVillain93> Not even
[0:58:00] <%qazwsxedc168> eh
[0:58:00] <%TrebassStream> Not true, abilities can scale off of AD and AP
[0:58:01] <darkmind95> Stop lying to Pat!
[0:58:01] <+xXWoadXx> big wrong
[0:58:01] <$raziel391> Attack Damage
[0:58:01] <+Kaiserzelcor> NO
[0:58:01] <simulationbard> NO ITS NOT
[0:58:02] <dawnks> NOOOO
[0:58:02] <+Audega> BECAUSE IT'S STUPID
[0:58:02] <Palmer_Huntaway> Idk cause game devs want to make shit harder to understand
[0:58:02] <AhmCha> WAIT NO, WHO SAID THAT?
[0:58:02] <%kyh9> Because some abilities use your AD
[0:58:02] <%bevyrage> some physical attacks scale on AP
[0:58:02] <%Solidus_113> THAT'S WRONG
[0:58:02] <%Garthunox> NO
[0:58:03] <alastorpayne> NO
[0:58:03] <weizamaleza> LUL
[0:58:04] <Silversunburst> AD red AP blue
[0:58:04] <ReDexuz> yes
[0:58:04] <+fatcrab> AD is also abilities sometimes
[0:58:04] <Forester_Skippy> thats not true for half the champs lol
[0:58:04] <$raziel391> Attack Power
[0:58:04] <+Baekon01> dont worry that some abilities are ad
[0:58:04] <freezydude> PAT THATS WRONGGG
[0:58:05] <koolaid_kevster> do you know your not in que @angriestpat
[0:58:06] <MyNameIsRasus> NO
[0:58:06] <shinji_ifrit> except abilites can scale with ad so no
[0:58:06] <ape_hawk> yeah, its dumb
[0:58:07] <freezydude> ITS ATTACK POWER
[0:58:07] <Imsoverylazy> THERE ARE ABILITIES THAT SCALE WITH AD AS WELL
[0:58:07] <%Shadowthedigger> AP affect ap champ auto attacks too
[0:58:07] <%Garthunox> ONE GUY
[0:58:08] <%Agami23> attack damage and ability power.
[0:58:08] <TundraOW> AD is do combo, AP is big number
[0:58:09] <freezydude> AND ABILITY POWER
[0:58:09] <zenith0111> CHAT
[0:58:10] <+Jekado> its not always magic because of the champion
[0:58:10] <%SilentEric> Some abilities go off of AD.
[0:58:11] <flyingtentaclemonster> Because that is wrong and whoever said its dumb
[0:58:12] <sosandstorm> So there are some magic damage spells that scale off AD and some magic damage attacks that scale off AP depending on champion, im so sorry
[0:58:14] <zenith0111> CHIT
[0:58:16] <%nmaten> pat please stop looking to twitch chat for answers
[0:58:16] <ReDexuz> but some abilities use AD
[0:58:16] <NachoCanDandyRavage> lmao
[0:58:17] <+MinimumPayne> back when this game came out it used to be that abilities could only scale off ap
[0:58:17] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> should be called red and blue
[0:58:18] <vingadivo> pat you have components itens that form into a full item, dont try to learn the components, only the full itens ghat are the ones super expensive
[0:58:18] <ButterMyBrisket> getting one guy'd LUL
[0:58:19] <+boredpantz> AP is magic damage AP is physical damage
[0:58:19] <+SpiceMustF1ow> oh chat
[0:58:21] <kryedge> some champions scale with AD, some with AP, and some with BOTH
[0:58:22] <+kingcroix> AD = physical AP = magic
[0:58:22] <$povertysenpai> get a friend to talk you through it then in a call
[0:58:23] <shinji_ifrit> yuo
[0:58:23] <Tressing> Some abilities are based on AD
[0:58:23] <+MinimumPayne> later champs got ad scalings
[0:58:23] <VaudevilleVillain93> They're all incomplete explanations
[0:58:24] <%TweetHeart> which is infuriating
[0:58:24] <Arek_1> F A D C
[0:58:25] <Damie904> Attack Damage, Ability Damage. Basic Attacks use AD. Abilities, depending on the champ use AP or AD.
[0:58:26] <darkmind95> DARIUS ONLY USES AD!
[0:58:26] <Imsoverylazy> IT MAKES NO SENSE, JUST GO WITH IT
[0:58:26] <weizamaleza> Being trained by chat seems weird huh
[0:58:27] <+SpiceMastah> yo what is pat doing right now?
[0:58:27] <%LaughingCatt> Pat needs a friend who plays to explain, Chat can't explain shit
[0:58:32] <%SilentEric> If the ability has a RED number it is AD, if it is a blue number it is AP
[0:58:32] <%WritebroAlpha> When you read the tooltip for an ability, the ORANGE NUMBER scales with AD, the TEAL NUMBER scales with AP
[0:58:32] <darkmind95> MORDEKAISE ONLY USES AP!
[0:58:32] <+RogueInfinity> @AngriestPat I'm going to make an item video just for you. Alright
[0:58:32] <%TrebassStream> Darius scales off of AD if I'm correct
[0:58:32] <+2DSuperiority> I don'y know LoL and I love this
[0:58:33] <+MistahNick> AD is attack damage, AP is ability power
[0:58:34] <%Mekhet09> Ad =Attack power AP =ability power but it's physical and magic
[0:58:34] <%arcaderabbit48> @sosandstorm Shout out to pre-rework Miss Fortune and her bonkers Ult scaling
[0:58:35] <ReDexuz> it's weird
[0:58:35] <%dasmause> @AngriestPat just dont worry about it, its dumb, all that matters is what to build for character
[0:58:36] <Imsoverylazy> DARIUS IS 100% AD
[0:58:36] <+anhero64> red text = ad blue= ap
[0:58:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Depends on the champion
[0:58:39] <Witchtaker> All abilities scale with movement speed just build movement speed
[0:58:39] <+Malevalent> chat chill a bit guys. @AngriestPat yeah it is kinda dumb. really i just view it as they wanted to make it sound different than other games.
[0:58:39] <ofloofy> pat having a mental breakdown due to chats information LUL
[0:58:39] <shiny_prinny> champions scale differntly: Darius scales with AD, Mordekaiser scales with AP
[0:58:41] <KattyCitty> if champion shoot or smack, their stuff scales ad, if champion cast spell or look like a freak, they scale ap
[0:58:41] <freezydude> Dont you have like people on discord for this pat lol
[0:58:42] <+MinimumPayne> its just a consequence of the early design that we have these terms now
[0:58:42] <+leviting> should've just called them strength and arcane lol
[0:58:42] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> depends on the champion
[0:58:42] <%skizzuto> I can see the gears grinding to a halt in Pat's brain
[0:58:43] <Wan6Saber> depends on the champ
[0:58:44] <%bevyrage> for example: Darius has only AD abilities iirc, but his bleed scales on AP?
[0:58:44] <kryedge> wow wtf people are going insane
[0:58:44] <waterstealer> @AngriestPat if you're not gonna actually learn the game you should just quit. it requires a higher amount of investment than it seems like you care to put into it
[0:58:44] <OldManDeckardCain> Just play Smite, it's way easier to understand LUL
[0:58:45] <Forester_Skippy> if your ability has an orange color for the damage numbe rin the discription its an AD abillity if its green its AP
[0:58:45] <+drawminomicon> This is would be so much easier if you had 1 PERSON who actually plays the game tell you what they mean in person
[0:58:45] <%Deadbulky> Red for AD blue for AP
[0:58:46] <vingadivo> AD IS PHISICAL DAMAGE AP IS MAGIC DAMAGE
[0:58:47] <Squdnate> 3, chat is not helping at all
[0:58:47] <ScrubTheNerd> AD is red number, AP is blue number :)
[0:58:48] <JoelFleran> orange numbers are ad and green are ap
[0:58:48] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatWrong apatGoblin
[0:58:49] <+hambuttburglar> AD also feeds into your auto attacks while AP only goes into some abilities. For example, Garen has no AP scalings, all his scalings are AD. apart from his W which has a max health scaling on his shield.
[0:58:49] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> this game is dumb
[0:58:49] <PunishedMercer_> you could always try labbing items in practice mode. sorry you're being bombarded pat.
[0:58:50] <alastorpayne> Orange dmg=AD green dmg =AP
[0:58:51] <+ojama1987> it cant just be "magic" and "damage" because both are fluid
[0:58:51] <+rowboat_girlyman> SUCH A PERFECT SYSTEM IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE EXPLAINED
[0:58:51] <+Baekon01> just use hp pots
[0:58:51] <NachoCanDandyRavage> chat is powerful
[0:58:54] <Murphio_GS> Seems like DOTA is trash afterall
[0:58:54] <%TweetHeart> look for red number or blue number when you highlight the ability, to know which it is
[0:58:55] <%AncelDeLambert> it's your own fault for asking chat, Pat
[0:58:55] <%nmaten> it is your auto attack
[0:58:56] <+TheFakeBob> You need one person to break it down cuz chat cannot explain it well enough
[0:58:57] <BlackermanZX> @AngriestPat The ability usually says it in the description
[0:59:00] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:59:00] <simulationbard> It is your auto attack
[0:59:00] <%Jaxnos> League of Legends is Pokemon
[0:59:00] <Rhinoprotoss> Here comes the Pat ignore
[0:59:01] <%WritebroAlpha> No, AD is always your auto attack
[0:59:03] <+Jam_Jam> You shouldn't worry too much about builds and strats right now mostly learning champs and how to play the game
[0:59:04] <%Deadbulky> It is your auto attack
[0:59:04] <+Cymen90> @Murphio_GS Dota is superior
[0:59:05] <ape_hawk> @AngriestPat just pick one person you trust to give you league lessons in the chat and focus on them
[0:59:06] <%WritebroAlpha> AD is also sometimes your abilities
[0:59:06] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> AD will always boost your basic auto attack. Depending on the champ, they get extra synergy for their abilities
[0:59:08] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatHoldon apatWrong apatGoblin
[0:59:08] <+anhero64> AD text red AP text BLUE
[0:59:08] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> auto attack is red
[0:59:10] <KattyCitty> ad is ALWAYS your auto attack but is ALSO other stuff
[0:59:11] <%TG_Cid11> ok thats dumb
[0:59:11] <ReDexuz> NO
[0:59:12] <Finaldragoon> the one time where DotA 2 is simpler
[0:59:12] <KattyCitty> ap is ONLY other stuff
[0:59:13] <%Solidus_113> don't forget about True Damage
[0:59:13] <+eanscrale> Are they attack points???
[0:59:13] <vingadivo> ad is your auto atack always
[0:59:14] <+kilroy_10> This is really useful for a guy that cant read the items
[0:59:15] <%SilentEric> AD is physical and is stopped by armor. AP is magic and is stopped by Magic Resist.
[0:59:15] <+boredpantz> @AngriestPat Its faster to use the abbreviations in game
[0:59:16] <+kingofcinders> AP or AD generally affects the scaling of abilities, some champions have better AD or AP scalings. It's why say, Mordekaiser builds differently than Darius does.
[0:59:16] <darkmind95> @vingadivo STOP LYING! IT'S NOY!
[0:59:16] <%TweetHeart> It is the auto attack, and also some abilities
[0:59:17] <MyNameIsRasus> It is your auto attack, but not limited to it.
[0:59:17] <Murphio_GS> @Cymen90 Bruh
[0:59:18] <%Deadbulky> ? ? ? ? ?
[0:59:18] <PumpAction> LUL
[0:59:18] <+korean_random> holy shit, Pat, just watch a LoL 101 video or something
[0:59:19] <koolaid_kevster> favorite streamer going down the drain to league hype that he was never introduced too smh @angriestpat
[0:59:19] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> What?
[0:59:19] <Finchit> Its complicated bruh
[0:59:20] <%VantomPayne> ask A PERSON
[0:59:20] <BlackermanZX> @AngriestPat AD IS your auto attack. chat is being dumb
[0:59:20] <DivineMessiah> AD = attack damage AP = ability power
[0:59:20] <%dasmause> who the hell said its not auto attack
[0:59:21] <%wujak> @AngriestPat you are fine ignoring the items for now. it hasnt made a different in any of your games
[0:59:21] <Cycrosa> PAT PLEASE
[0:59:22] <Guktar> what do you mean i have to do a pretzel motion ?
[0:59:22] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Reminds me of when Woolie tried to explain Meaties
[0:59:23] <%TweetHeart> AP is just some abilities
[0:59:23] <shinji_ifrit> it is for auto attacks and abilities
[0:59:23] <+ojama1987> it IS your auto, and also some abilities
[0:59:24] <simulationbard> No, it is your atuo attack
[0:59:24] <+SlightlySychotic> To be fair, I played Smite for a year and a half and most of this jargon is baffling to me.
[0:59:24] <OldManDeckardCain> ONE GUY
[0:59:24] <ThirdPersonPhil> Who is Talking!?
[0:59:25] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat Stop crowd sourcing you'll never get good advice
[0:59:25] <Imsoverylazy> AD improves your basic attacks as well as abilities with AD scaling. Ability power only improves abilities with AP scaling @AngriestPat
[0:59:25] <+Jekado> now i remember why i hate league
[0:59:25] <%Deadbulky> What?
[0:59:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Ask PLAGUE
[0:59:27] <Finchit> LUL
[0:59:27] <FeelsBadPat> chat is literally garabge
[0:59:27] <COMB711> It literally is your auto attack
[0:59:28] <Div_the_Penguin> it's not the game it's the chat LUL
[0:59:28] <dawnks> ad is always auto attack
[0:59:28] <+Vegaburd> This is what happens when you join a game 10 years in
[0:59:29] <freezydude> PAT JUST LIKE ASK YOUR DISCORD FRIENDS OR WATCH YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING LOL
[0:59:29] <%nmaten> it is your auto attack whoever said it wasnt is wrong
[0:59:29] <+ojama1987> swords dont cast spells on you they hit you
[0:59:29] <Iggeh0> chat is getting trolled hard
[0:59:30] <%Who_lio42> it IS your auto attack, its just some abilities use it mainly too
[0:59:30] <nikoloas_> you really need someone to talk to about this stuff lol
[0:59:30] <Finaldragoon> 3
[0:59:31] <%Mekhet09> AD is out attack and it affects specific abilities.
[0:59:31] <%dasmause> O N E G U Y
[0:59:31] <KattyCitty> BRING IN THE ANALIST
[0:59:31] <nechronia> This is gonna be difficult
[0:59:31] <%WritebroAlpha> WHO'S TALKING
[0:59:32] <ReDexuz> some champs use ad even if it is magical damage
[0:59:32] <%SilentEric> AD is auto attack and abilities that show a RED number.
[0:59:33] <+Cymen90> @Murphio_GS I know. Stating the obvious.
[0:59:34] <+Jekado> oh wait i always knew
[0:59:34] <+SpiceMastah> AD IS ALWAYS THE AUTO NERD
[0:59:36] <Jeexx> Pat is enjoying this way too much astrovrLul
[0:59:36] <FeelsBadPat> you hav epeople who have never played the game trying to tell you how ot play
[0:59:38] <kryedge> AD IS your auto attack, but also your skills can stack with either AD or AP
[0:59:39] <93lobo> AA auto attack scales with ad
[0:59:40] <+Erzaal> Yo
[0:59:40] <+RogueInfinity> Everyone in this chat it litereally Iron IV
[0:59:41] <NJigglypuff> in in-game text, AD will be colored red and AP will be colored blue. darius' abilities mostly scale off of AD, so build such items. if you ever play a mage or support, build AP items
[0:59:42] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> ask plague
[0:59:42] <+kingofcinders> Mordekaiser's abilities have AP scalings but very low AD scalings (if any). That's why you build "Mage" items on him.
[0:59:42] <%Deadbulky> Your auto attack scales off AD
[0:59:42] <ReDexuz> look for color coded damage instead
[0:59:42] <+Ketsueki_Tera> this game is too hard to explain through chat lol
[0:59:43] <+MajorCrasher> this is why I don't play League LUL
[0:59:43] <+anhero64> just play video game and suffer
[0:59:43] <Silversunburst> some champs use AP as the main auto damage as well
[0:59:45] <+l33t_j4gu4r> it's all champ specific
[0:59:45] <zenith0111> It's almost like there is a lot of unnecessary mechanics just for the sake for being convultated Jebaited
[0:59:45] <+rittzler> NotLikeThis
[0:59:47] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> AP will generally only ever affect abilities; in soem cases, it helps mages deal more damage to turrets too so AD champs aren't overly-favored
[0:59:47] <%WhereIsWill> DONT LISTEN TO US PAT WERE EVIL
[0:59:47] <VaudevilleVillain93> Pat, chat WILL hold you back. You need organized explanation
[0:59:47] <ReDexuz> COLORS
[0:59:48] <%CalderGaming> lol
[0:59:48] <%GunToad> This is dumb as fuck LUL

[0:59:49] <Wan6Saber> @koolaid_kevster he played mobas before, yo
[0:59:49] <Ipsenscastle> We have 1,2 & 3 - can we have 4 for when the game is wrong?
[0:59:49] <%bevyrage> you seriously shouldn't be asking advice from over a thousand people pat, and instead listen to a couple of peeps who are like in a discord call or something
[0:59:50] <%SilentEric> We can show you in game
[0:59:50] <+kilroy_10> You guys are explaining footsies to a guy tahts asking how to punch
[0:59:51] <waterstealer> @AngriestPat you're never gonna learn this game from chat

[0:59:52] <alwayspronking> what happun?
[0:59:52] <MyNameIsRasus> 3
[0:59:53] <+Erzaal> so fast eh?
[0:59:54] <flyingtentaclemonster> AD scales your auto attacks always but also some skills, some skills scale of AP, better look it up though, you are glnna get confused
[0:59:54] <%Deano8817> 1 but also 3
[0:59:54] <weizamaleza> Just watch a tutorial it will be fine
[0:59:55] <shinji_ifrit> League is dumb

[1:00:00] <%qazwsxedc168> u guys are gonna scare him off
[1:00:00] <+fatcrab> AD is auto attack and physical abilities AP is magical abilities (and also adds damage to towers if you have mostly AP)
[1:00:01] <Imsoverylazy> ITS A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHETHER ABILITIES SCALE WITH AP OR AD, BUT MOST CHAMPIONS TEND TOWARDS ONE OR THE OTHER
[1:00:01] <+l33t_j4gu4r> look at how your abilities scale with what
[1:00:01] <%Sephirios> Auto attacks scale from AD, but some abilities also scale from AD. and some champions have AP bonuses to AP
[1:00:02] <ofloofy> LUL
[1:00:03] <kryedge> and if we get in the neety greety if you have a LOT of AP your auto attacks start stacking with AP
[1:00:03] <+2DSuperiority> Pat is in it to troll the LoL players in chat

[1:01:55] <%CalamitousTea> All that matters is big numbers go up.
[1:01:55] <sosandstorm> low key the fastest way to learn chamion kits is to play ARAM
[1:01:56] <zenith0111> Takes league way too seriously ^ Kappa
[1:01:56] <93lobo> Best advice watch other streamers to learn pat
[1:01:59] <%Madbearv> at least I don't drink monster like some sort of SELLOUT
[1:02:01] <VritraReiRei> Twitch Plays AngriestPat Plays League of Legends :D
[1:02:03] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> zoneLemmyL zoneLemmy zoneLemmyR
[1:02:03] <+Peacockney> Lol @Vashido22
[1:02:05] <+kingofcinders> Pat, if you go to Darius' wiki page you can literally figure this whole thing in all of about 10 seconds. >_>
[1:02:05] <universaldove> DO COMBO
[1:02:06] <MyNameIsRasus> League really benefits from someone explaining stuff to you
[1:02:06] <%WritebroAlpha> Zac is cool
[1:02:07] <%SilentEric> Zac is the best
[1:02:08] <vampireinarm> Pat, but the difference between doing a hadoken or a shoryu here is that it can affect the rest of your 30 MINUTE GAME
[1:02:12] <+anhero64> zac is MAD fun. for a league champ
[1:02:12] <+Jekado> oh i'm super excited my friend got his a cps3 third strike working arcade third strike!!!
[1:02:14] <vingadivo> zac x riven OwO
[1:02:15] <Explodincatz> good
[1:02:16] <%Typhaeon> FADC = Fuckin' AD Carry
[1:02:18] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Make Woolie play and watch him
[1:02:18] <VaudevilleVillain93> Just don't listen to this wall of shit
[1:02:20] <dakkster> I like cheese
[1:02:27] <Forester_Skippy> honestly pat should jsut fuzzy every enemy in league and easy win who needs items
[1:02:28] <Finaldragoon> you heard it everyone, Pat is boring, show's over
[1:02:29] <PunishedMercer_> if you ever want to test items, practice tool is your friend.
[1:02:29] <vingadivo> true
[1:02:31] <ItsAGundamu> Then I guess you'll never git gud
[1:02:31] <Imsoverylazy> Its a proven fact that reading all of the lore improves you performance in game
[1:02:32] <%nmaten> so watch a good steamer then apatSmug
[1:02:37] <%Deadbulky> Just watch the pro as heck guide to master yi and you will know everything you need to know
[1:02:37] <hntronium> Don't you watch woolie sometimes though?
[1:02:38] <%Manbearpigbear> Manbearpigbear subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:02:38] <%GetMendoza> GetMendoza subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! another month, another sub, another reminder to get... MENDOZA!

[1:02:41] <%CalamitousTea> Twitch sucks. Watching streamers suck. I miss when YouTube was good.
[1:02:42] <zenith0111> Watch EyePatach Wolf explain it Kappa
[1:02:42] <%SilentEric> What bad advice. Never watch streamers
[1:02:45] <%Madbearv> edgelord
[1:02:45] <+xXWoadXx> get aatorix
[1:02:46] <KattyCitty> aatrox is admittedly pretty cool
[1:02:47] <%The_Baaz> Aatrox is hella fun
[1:02:47] <93lobo> well nvm then lol
[1:02:47] <Imsoverylazy> Has he tried Pantheon yet?
[1:02:50] <vampireinarm> imagine thinking you get good by watchin shitty streamers LUL
[1:02:51] <+Vegaburd> You at least gotta watch Tyler1
[1:02:51] <+boredpantz> Pat Pyke is a Support not a toplaner
[1:02:53] <+Jekado> i like the video of woolie listening to pat talk about LoL and his brain leaves
[1:02:54] <Wan6Saber> @Imsoverylazy cool story bro
[1:02:55] <ScrubTheNerd> That was the correct lesson
[1:02:55] <vingadivo> aatrox is cool heals a lot
[1:02:56] <+Vegaburd> that mans a legend
[1:02:56] <+TheFakeBob> Yes.
[1:02:56] <+VashyronM> Why play a real game when you can play a dead game like HoTS
[1:02:58] <shiny_prinny> that is correct
[1:03:00] <%Conraderino45> Can confirm pretty cool
[1:03:01] <%LaughingCatt> Pyke is a pirate ghost who is great at bullying
[1:03:01] <VritraReiRei> Devilman Crybaby! :D
[1:03:01] <pectusumbra> That's correct, yes
[1:03:01] <KattyCitty> cool big man smack hard do damage win game
[1:03:02] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> play mundo, he's probably trash in the current meta
[1:03:02] <MyNameIsRasus> correct
[1:03:04] <ape_hawk> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[1:03:05] <vingadivo> correct
[1:03:05] <%SilentEric> Ability based champions. But his abilities are AD abilities.
[1:03:08] <Tressing> Pyke is fun as hell
[1:03:08] <%BoboDaHobo> I'm watching your streams to learn before jumping into the game again, so my recommendation is watching and donating to angriestpat
[1:03:15] <Tucker0603> his Justicar skin is rad as fuck
[1:03:16] <%nmaten> yes they do youre not watchign the right person
[1:03:17] <+boredpantz> Pat some streamers do

[1:03:39] <koolaid_kevster> @wan6saber that makes sense he does do that alot it's just the fact I played this game for 10 yrs now and I don't want my fav streamer streaming this toxic game
[1:03:40] <Damie904> Pat they literally do, you're super wrong.
[1:03:40] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> just play bad and piss people off
[1:03:40] <Imsoverylazy> Mobi boots

[1:03:59] <Tressing> Watch BoxBox and his sick Riven plays
[1:03:59] <Ipsenscastle> OK bootsman
[1:04:00] <EuropanLamprey> Watching FPS streams feels like watching an Aimbot that learned to speak
[1:04:00] <%Reevesypoo> ok zoomer
[1:04:00] <nikoloas_> they'll generally say something like "Yeah this is a merc treads game."
[1:04:00] <Kuubyy> I'M ONLY 45

[1:04:02] <ralphfromdk> Makigcarpusedfly's "actual champion spotlights" for fun videos that teach champs if need be
[1:04:03] <LixFury> Ok Zoomers

[1:04:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Boomer is a state of mind, and you're about to reached Bolomer Nirvana
[1:04:05] <pectusumbra> It'd probably be simplest to learn in little categories. Like boots, armor items, AD items, ect, so you know what you need
[1:04:05] <+Valison> Ok boomvin
[1:04:09] <+Cymen90> The game is TEN YEARS OLD. All of YOU are the BOOMERS!
[1:04:10] <hntronium> you're older than me so you're automatically a boomer

[1:04:17] <asurite_warrior> There's probably some sort of tutor streamer you could watch if you'd like to go back to university.

[1:06:38] <+Jekado> fucking forgot about that
[1:06:39] <%WritebroAlpha> "Leashing" is when you help your jungler with their first camp by damaging it with them before heading to lane. It helps them off to a good start without wasting your team.

[1:07:15] <+tweedler92> This sounds like actual insanity
[1:07:16] <%The_Baaz> Leashing is assisting in damaging the enemy so he can kill it
[1:07:16] <+Jekado> this got better now
[1:07:16] <%SilentEric> That means help damage the first jungle man so jungler takes less damage. It is helpful to the jungle man.
[1:07:16] <scoot_io> Such is League

[1:17:33] <%bevyrage> oh right it's armor
[1:17:35] <Tressing> jhin has red buff
[1:17:36] <shiny_prinny> jhin killed olaf, that's how he got red
[1:17:37] <vingadivo> pat use R on jhin only if hes far away from his tower otherwise you'll get damaged
[1:17:37] <+Jekado> should he be using his q to last hit?

[1:17:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Now he can't do that for 5 minutes
[1:17:59] <%nmaten> you should tell your jungler so he can get a free gank

[1:18:01] <zecht89> you can also farm the jungle after you've pushed

[1:21:50] <emzspurs> pat you noob Kappa
[1:21:51] <waterstealer> it doesnt work like that
[1:21:54] <zecht89> you need to push and help other lanes
[1:21:54] <NachoCanDandyRavage> for ability upgrades it might be useful to bind them to alt-q,w, etc. so you dont have to stop and click on the ability. its annoying to get used to but its allowed me to upgrade mid fight
[1:21:54] <+chase959> go help olaf
[1:21:54] <%bevyrage> hold tab and see who's got the kill/death desparity though.
[1:21:55] <BunnyEmperor> paranoid

[1:26:21] <ScrubTheNerd> That only works for so long though
[1:26:21] <+MisterRockett> Then you should Jungle
[1:26:22] <Louie_Salmon> Jungle is the most alone
[1:26:22] <SvenHolgersson> Fair
[1:26:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> You may like Nasus then
[1:26:24] <+Ayyy_Steve> As a top main I know that feeling so well.
[1:26:24] <+BIumen> nah thats valid
[1:26:25] <PowerfulBlackGangs> So, why does Top have 1 dude? Is that the standard?
[1:26:26] <vingadivo> MORDE IS GOOD FOR THAT
[1:26:28] <%strugglepunk2> The pure 1v1 between men that exists only in top lane
[1:26:28] <%Who_lio42> I want to best a man in 1v1 combat
[1:26:28] <Kongro_> bottoms like playing top
[1:26:28] <krabthecrab> Play jungle and just stay in the jungle
[1:26:30] <waterstealer> YOU HAVE 2 LEVELS ON HIM
[1:26:31] <DemonioB> 1v1 game
[1:26:33] <elspiceweasel> as a dota player, I play offlane because I have trust issues
[1:26:33] <NeonBleu> Corki coming
[1:26:33] <Tunykun> Top is an island. Its basically a 20 min footsies in higher level play.
[1:26:34] <theKingRamses> RUN
[1:26:34] <waterstealer> JUST KILL HIM
[1:26:34] <+DarkShadow124> Top players dont get flamed that much ...I think
[1:26:35] <%THATGUY_789> I want to solo this team game

[1:26:40] <VritraReiRei> Corki is coming! @AngriestPat
[1:26:41] <%Deadbulky> Its a duel lane
[1:26:41] <+nechallenger> Top is fighting game land.
[1:26:43] <MyNameIsRasus> R him
[1:26:43] <+Cymen90> @blumen no it is not
[1:26:44] <+jt427> Nasus main
[1:26:45] <+OneGorillionDollars> bop him
[1:26:47] <Damie904> Pat, go back before 3 of em show up and maul you
[1:26:49] <+kevlarkoala> you play udyr, you hide in the jungle, you never come out and hope your team wins without you
[1:26:50] <%SilentEric> Jhinn not so cocky after getting MACED
[1:26:51] <%freezydude> @PowerfulBlackGangs it's the standard because of how the maps oriented, the dragon is easier to take so there's 2 people down there while baron is way harder.
[1:26:53] <MoonlightP> just ult him and kill him
[1:26:54] <Louie_Salmon> @powerfulblackgangs Has to do with where things are in the jungle, but it is kinda just standard
[1:26:55] <vingadivo> top is sacred 1v1 land
[1:26:57] <+tire_marqs> BACK UP

[1:27:03] <%HollowedIdjit> if you want the best Leave Me Alone experience, play Yorick @angriestpat
[1:27:05] <%Ixiah> of course Pat plays the 2hand slow hero LUL
[1:27:05] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat you can just ult and kill him and this point
[1:27:09] <BlackermanZX> Pat would do good with nasus actually
[1:27:13] <+Jekado> is it 3 towers down on both sides?
[1:27:16] <waterstealer> YO PICK UP NASUS
[1:27:17] <MoonlightP> pat wouldn't do good with nasus
[1:27:17] <+Shoosler> NIDALEE

[1:35:24] <%bevyrage> it's more the TV is a good distance away and the UI is fitted for a PC you're sitting in front of

[1:35:35] <Saltima> ult corki
[1:35:36] <Tressing> If you ult Corky your team can't help you fight him, and he seriously outdamages you..

[1:35:42] <%RayDaug> Can you Q>Flash on Morde?
[1:35:43] <%freezydude> BUT WE DO THO MAJOR
[1:35:43] <+Jekado> they are gettin dragon
[1:35:43] <%nmaten> you need armor and magic resist or the corki is gonna keep 2 shotting you
[1:35:56] <%ThatOneGameTester> ulting jhin would be good
[1:35:56] <Tucker0603> NOT THE BEST GIRL
[1:35:58] <+Jekado> that corki is the only thing that will really win it for them
[1:35:59] <BunnyEmperor> yeah literally the only threat in the enemy team is corki
[1:36:00] <+ojama1987> using morde e to last hit champs is a boss move
[1:36:02] <%ToadKing> guys i think pat is the only person on his team who can reliably fight against corki
[1:36:02] <vingadivo> pat is pretty good at landing E honestly
[1:36:03] <%freezydude> Hasnt spawned yet
[1:36:04] <+ojama1987> looks so cool
[1:36:09] <MoonlightP> their entire team sucks ass except corki
[1:36:11] <%freezydude> you can press tab and at the top it'll show when every big buff spawns
[1:36:11] <%ToadKing> everyone else literally dies in two hits
[1:36:14] <+Jekado> but he can solo push for win if they are not careful
[1:36:16] <MoonlightP> so just nullify corki and you should win
[1:36:21] <%bevyrage> that is good advice actually. armor + magic resist items will help him tank hits
[1:36:23] <+anhero64> buy any item(s) and press button(s) to win(?)
[1:36:26] <%wsintai> @ToadKing If he and Teemo team up on him they can crush the dude
[1:36:29] <%bevyrage> ate a flash!

[1:44:14] <mankeyfigh> @leonegaming6 no
[1:44:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Is 10 feet not a reasonable distance?
[1:44:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Thresh is so cool
[1:44:19] <%TrebassStream> @AngriestPat You won't need to read the item descriptions 10ft away if you know what the items do
[1:44:20] <LokimenD> @leonegaming6 He won in our hearts
[1:44:21] <Verboseobserver> Pat invest in piss yellow gamer glasses
[1:44:21] <%SoFarFetched> Pat should play the Neeko Neeko Niiiii LUL
[1:44:23] <%SashaStarshine> I would simply see better
[1:44:25] <vingadivo> pat the best way to learn itens is to read the itens you get recomended on blitz gg, dont try and remember all of them just the ones that are useful for you champions
[1:44:25] <BunnyEmperor> Buy glasses Kappa
[1:44:26] <%GingaNZ> @AngriestPat only liisten to people that give you money
[1:44:28] <Noktifer> 1080 instead of 4k maybe. Like, you kinda need to be able to see the text for items. Would help to have someone with you as well. Mihn said he'd help ya!
[1:44:28] <shabop> get some binoculars
[1:44:28] <zenith0111> Either move the couch or get a bigger tv. No joke.
[1:44:29] <%galaxyswirl> @GarbageNirvana like 4 feet away why?
[1:44:29] <necropant> Pat, late game Mordikaiser if you aren't fed you mostly just act as a wall between your adc and the enemy damage so when you run you leave your team without the meatshield
[1:44:34] <+anhero64> does ad thresh still fuck or is that time long passed?
[1:44:35] <gighardt> @leonegaming6 he surrendered
[1:44:37] <nauticalgypsy> @angriestpat you can look at the items before going into a game and make a custom list to make it easier on deciding what to buy
[1:44:38] <+leviting> just squint?

[1:46:18] <%Sephirios> why not just learn to see better?
[1:46:19] <%XxBTExX> It has nothing to do with the client, its just that the game isnt meant to be played on a TV 10 ft away.
[1:46:19] <+Vegaburd> just get bigger tv 4head

[1:46:26] <%ItsSansom> We're gonna need you to scoot up and sit an inch away from the screen there Pat
[1:46:27] <Zebroneath> DO IT
[1:46:28] <ShineTheDiamond> Your advice is bad and you should feel bad!
[1:46:28] <EuropanLamprey> Pat, you're supposed to play League, not fight with it in OBS
[1:46:28] <+FrenchTact1cs> guess you have to move your tv for your boomer eyes
[1:46:29] <%trunubus> has anyone snipped you? I would put your camera over the minimap
[1:46:31] <%Arazien> I'm surprised that Pat doesn't have a SETTINGS emote yet
[1:46:32] <elspiceweasel> what if i advise you to stop touching yourself at night?
[1:46:32] <Noktifer> Make your gamer cube into a MODOK type chair, so you can get closer to your TV.

[1:46:38] <+Jekado> you can't take a picture with your phone and post it on twitter?
[1:46:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> you know what maybe its best that pat does not use the game chat
[1:46:44] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat the green icon next to your portrait shows core stats (AP, AD, Armor, MR) and the blue shows numbers from your runes. Having either on is good (but runes are more interesting in my opinion)

[1:53:56] <vingadivo> how many regular humans is a pat
[1:53:57] <ChrisM341> 2pats vs Woolie rap battle when
[1:54:02] <zenith0111> Optimistic but not realistic
[1:54:03] <Ultimatefool> 3/5
[1:54:06] <Infeirno23> what an elitist mindset
[1:54:07] <+Jekado> 2pats in a trench coat
[1:54:12] <+Jekado> i'd pay to see that
[1:54:13] <Angry_Ev1L> @vingadivo like 0.6
[1:54:18] <+blueface_yea_ight> have you thought about seeing better?
[1:54:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> Buy Binoculars
[1:54:32] <BlackermanZX> You have that blitz thing so who cares at the moment
[1:54:33] <1matheuw> just memorize the item pictures
[1:54:33] <shiny_prinny> yeah its huge
[1:54:34] <+axenred> yes it is
[1:54:36] <%freezydude> Pat i would just start small
[1:54:38] <Angry_Ev1L> just buy no items
[1:54:38] <Imsoverylazy> Its only like 200
[1:54:40] <%freezydude> like go category by category
[1:54:40] <joylent_blue> yeah just keep some binoculars next to you
[1:54:41] <%VintageSpiffy> VintageSpiffy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I think LoL is perfect for you, especially since you feed on toxicity.
[1:54:42] <%SashaStarshine> It's a brick wall of information, this takes time.
[1:54:42] <+Jekado> don't learn just learn to get blowed up
[1:54:42] <%VintageSpiffy> VintageSpiffy's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[1:54:43] <MyNameIsRasus> It is
[1:54:43] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat can't you setup a buy list now, so you don't have to read anything in the shop?
[1:54:44] <Noktifer> Yea, if you Motorize your GamerCube though, you could drive closer to the TV.
[1:54:48] <theKingRamses> you scan filter out items with worthless stats for your character
[1:54:49] <BunnyEmperor> It's the only thing I hate about mobas
[1:54:50] <MelodyMedley> Pat should try out Jinx!
[1:54:54] <%ItsSansom> Just keep playing. It'll come naturally
[1:54:55] <%GingaNZ> just read your ones from blitz
[1:54:56] <shr0uder> You don’t need to learn itemisation
[1:54:57] <ShineTheDiamond> <3
[1:55:01] <%CalderGaming> @AngriestPat the key question is: will you be able to learn it just in time for Granblue Versus to come out
[1:55:02] <shr0uder> Just use the websites
[1:55:03] <93lobo> don't worry Pat take your time
[1:55:03] <%LaughingCatt> & any of them could change in updates :D
[1:55:04] <zenith0111> I imagine most are just better versions of other ones.
[1:55:05] <+Jekado> @Pendragwn i think he does have buylist
[1:55:07] <shiny_prinny> whenever you branch out into other roles, you'll learn more what items they build too
[1:55:08] <$Dreadlord134> He read my dono? No hurry just wondering
[1:55:09] <1matheuw> there used to be more of them
[1:55:11] <vingadivo> pat go on mohafirr and read the recomended itens for mordekaiser, you only need to know the itens of your mains for now and its only like 6 or 8
[1:55:11] <+sylph_uwu> the pros don't need to read the items, so pat doesn't either!
[1:55:14] <+maxtheflea> Yeah I get it man. Been playing this game for 6.5 years and I can understand how daunting that shit is @AngriestPat
[1:55:14] <+Jekado> but buylist don't help you adapt
[1:55:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Hey that's what I did!
[1:55:18] <+Shoosler> @AngriestPat SMITE let's you make custom item builds and has an auto-buy feature for them or the default recommended sets
[1:55:18] <Angry_Ev1L> I thought appp tells you
[1:55:19] <Infeirno23> most characters only use about 30-40
[1:55:19] <dakkster> everyone starts bad, you just got eyes on you, keep up the good work
[1:55:24] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat you can also just make item sets per character
[1:55:27] <%MaddyCaddy> Do you know about unique passives and stuff?
[1:55:31] <Imsoverylazy> What you're doing now is fine, so long as you're actually learning what the items actually do as you play
[1:55:37] <93lobo> You're getting better that's what matters most
[1:55:40] <%Average1001> i think youre good on the item front, id say learning characters and what they do is more important
[1:55:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> that's fine
[1:55:46] <%ItsSansom> Baby steps for baby legs
[1:55:46] <1matheuw> yeah thats fair
[1:55:47] <simulationbard> Learning items comes later
[1:55:47] <joylent_blue> one thing at a time
[1:55:47] <+Audega> Easy as 1 4 3
[1:55:51] <%skizzuto> From what I can tell, he's doing pretty well for a beginner
[1:55:52] <ShineTheDiamond> You're doing great, Pat!
[1:55:53] <+drawminomicon> Learn to play the game first. Figure out what items do later. It really is that simple
[1:55:54] <lomack42> you done any arams?
[1:55:55] <shiny_prinny> wait who did you jungle as?
[1:55:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Or you could learn to play Dota and open your mind's eye
[1:55:55] <+drawminomicon> basics are basics
[1:55:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat, maybe you've done this already, but after the stream maybe check out the forums for a fix for the text scaling.
[1:55:58] <+Jekado> @AngriestPat i was talking to someone else I think how you are playing is fine learning items takes a while anyways
[1:55:58] <Imsoverylazy> Untrue
[1:55:58] <%Verd_254> NEVER play mid
[1:55:59] <BlackermanZX> thats totally fine
[1:56:03] <+drawminomicon> FALSE
[1:56:05] <vingadivo> if you ever play adc try miss fortune she's really easy
[1:56:06] <%galaxyswirl> corki
[1:56:06] <Imsoverylazy> Itemisation is always important
[1:56:07] <%Verd_254> mid is where your hopes and dreams die
[1:56:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> the Goblin yes
[1:56:12] <%Conraderino45> corki
[1:56:14] <Imsoverylazy> And allows for cheesy builds
[1:56:16] <Renkage> @AngriestPat Play it like Tekken. Million items. But only need to know the best ones. Need armor? Get the armor item. Etc. At least that's how I get items
[1:56:21] <Rhinoprotoss> There's a damage breakdown when you die
[1:56:21] <+MinimumPayne> for your situation if blitz had an item guide in their client that would be good
[1:56:25] <+Vegaburd> dw pat, it just takes time'
[1:56:25] <slyarvicle08> Hello @AngriestPat how are you? I haven't seen you live in a while
[1:56:26] <%wujak> the death recap at the top at least shows the damage type breakdown
[1:56:27] <vingadivo> green armor is good for magic damage you did good
[1:56:29] <ahegotrigger> he also does ad and true damage
[1:56:30] <Angry_Ev1L> you don't. JUST LOSE
[1:56:30] <fragdar> @AngriestPat yo pat.. you should try Shaco.. every one will hate you, even yourself
[1:56:31] <+HyperCharge_Sam> well, you should have known that Pat
[1:56:32] <+Angrec> not really, some characters HAVE to have an item to function. like zed HAS to have the gunblade or he is shit
[1:56:33] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat and on top of that you need to be good at click
[1:56:33] <Angry_Ev1L> like a man
[1:56:36] <1matheuw> yeah
[1:56:38] <TundraOW> And his 4 other teammates
[1:56:38] <Tunykun> at least you understand the complexity
[1:56:39] <shiny_prinny> yeah
[1:56:39] <+Audega> And that's just for one opponent
[1:56:40] <+BIumen> yeah but the more you know, the more you apply that, its exponential learning
[1:56:41] <BlackermanZX> Pretty much
[1:56:43] <BunnyEmperor> No need to overthink it if you never play ranked though
[1:56:45] <%SilentEric> When you die, it shows what type of damage killed you in a pie chart. So thats one step.
[1:56:46] <therealtacopancakes> or just buff armor and hp if you're getting melted
[1:56:46] <alwayspronking> Yeah, that is a lot of steps
[1:56:46] <+Kaiserzelcor> Honestly there's not a whole lot more you could've done to itemize against corki
[1:56:47] <Arek_1> "Magic damage? You mean AP." Kappa
[1:56:48] <Damie904> Is there anyway you could get an app on your phone to help?
[1:56:50] <+FrenchTact1cs> you right
[1:56:50] <+Kaiserzelcor> he was way too far ahead
[1:56:52] <%MaddyCaddy> It takes a whole lot of time man, that's why people have thousands of hours
[1:56:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Yep! Its actually a ton of stuff to go over
[1:56:53] <shabop> honestly recommended is fine until you get higher
[1:56:54] <MyNameIsRasus> You're right
[1:56:55] <Tressing> Corky is mixed tho
[1:56:56] <Angry_Ev1L> play good game instead
[1:56:58] <+drawminomicon> YES PAT you got it. Just do exactly what you just said about items
[1:57:00] <Schuhart> I have many hundred hour, and I still juts buy what the base game recommends. I suck though.
[1:57:00] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat on the podcast you mentioned a second screen app that pros use for info and match ups, wouldnt such an app also recommend items?
[1:57:00] <Kiari13> duh, they're free :)
[1:57:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> Just keep doing what you're doing. You're doing great while learning
[1:57:03] <shinji_ifrit> Corki does physical AND magical damage, which is dumb @AngriestPat
[1:57:04] <DeathByPoke7> pat stares at items
[1:57:05] <%freezydude> there's probably phone apps for this too
[1:57:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> this is a good idea, honestly the bots can teach decently well for practicing too and leavers are less of a pain sicne the bots will turn off a hero for a leaver iirc
[1:57:09] <%SilentEric> Yep. That changes every two weeks
[1:57:09] <+DarkShadow124> Oh no
[1:57:12] <ape_hawk> OH BOY
[1:57:12] <Angry_Ev1L> lmao
[1:57:14] <vingadivo> yup
[1:57:15] <ape_hawk> DO IT
[1:57:16] <elspiceweasel> RANKED IS SRS BSNS
[1:57:17] <+SeantySean> >implying
[1:57:19] <BunnyEmperor> ok if you play ranked itemization actually matters more LUL
[1:57:20] <%nmaten> lmao you dont even know
[1:57:22] <SeBigBoss> bronze will be so fkin hype
[1:57:23] <Zelretch3000> YES
[1:57:23] <%boxofhooligans> @angriestpat The champion usually has like 3 CORE items, the rest can be adaptable to the situations.
[1:57:23] <+CrimsonRedBlaze> lol
[1:57:24] <zenith0111> Hahahahaha HE DOESN'T KNOW calebKek
[1:57:24] <Noktifer> Oh lord, no, Pat, RANKED will have MORE SMURFS
[1:57:25] <vingadivo> yeah its actually easier
[1:57:25] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat if you have someone *telling* you what to buy, then you dont have to worry about it until you get acclimated into the rest of the game
[1:57:28] <%WhereIsWill> ePAT RANKED GOD
[1:57:31] <yamikami13> Get into the ELO heel
[1:57:31] <Imsoverylazy> Pat, some Champions outright require certain items just to function. Itemisation isn't just for counterpicking!
[1:57:31] <%Average1001> dw pat ive been playing on and off since 2011 and i have no idea what to build on dudes sometimes haha
[1:57:32] <1matheuw> yeah but the people on your team is shit as wall
[1:57:32] <fragdar> the more you know about itens, the more you can try to make stupid builds
[1:57:32] <+Jekado> yeah you gonna be in smurf land for a good while
[1:57:32] <axivate_> What's Pat's summoner name?
[1:57:33] <shiny_prinny> your Matchmaking Rating is getting higher maybe
[1:57:33] <%SilentEric> Pat gets to DIAMOND
[1:57:35] <Owlboy7> those smurgs are probably bronze anyway LUL
[1:57:36] <RAH001> pat. ur gonna get a fucking laugh at how mad people get in rank. enjoy that shit xD
[1:57:38] <vingadivo> ranked is actually easier than normal smurf qeue
[1:57:40] <TioXyco> I hope you your anti venom with you, because that shit is TOXIC
[1:57:49] <1matheuw> pat for chalenjour 2020
[1:57:55] <+MrMcCrabby> brave of you to assume there arent smurfs in ranked
[1:57:56] <FeelsBadPat> it will come to you by second nature eventually, trust literally was in the same position as you, I thought you couldnt buy items until you had the full price when i first started
[1:57:59] <TioXyco> "chill" and "ranked league" do not mix in the same phrase
[1:58:05] <+Majorpainful> lmfao
[1:58:05] <%ThatOneGameTester> draft is where the smurfs hang a lot
[1:58:07] <TofuNyan> I would sub but i cant afford, but i can afford to say this, I appreciate you pate, paige and chat <3

[1:58:16] <%Reaviar> its cause it is
[1:58:16] <TofuNyan> i wrote pat pate. im dead.
[1:58:17] <%SilentEric> TRUE
[1:58:17] <BunnyEmperor> Smite is OK
[1:58:18] <californaya> Smite's the only MOBA I've given more than 5 minutes.
[1:58:18] <Infeirno23> it is fine
[1:58:18] <%Agami23> it is, and now you can play as rwby
[1:58:18] <rnyeeeezus> it does
[1:58:20] <+Audega> It's not terrible, but it definitely isn't as high quality as DOTA or League
[1:58:20] <%MaddyCaddy> SMITE killed Tribes
[1:58:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> You aren't wrong
[1:58:20] <darkmind95> Smite looks dreadful
[1:58:21] <slyarvicle08> and the red bull? @AngriestPat
[1:58:21] <zenith0111> BIG TRUE
[1:58:22] <zayasu> SINGED PogChamp
[1:58:23] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Do not play Ranked. Do not ever play Ranked. That is where the masochistic, toxic gas chamber exists
[1:58:23] <haidanort> why are you playing league
[1:58:23] <%MaddyCaddy> So fuck SMITE
[1:58:23] <%galaxyswirl> SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGED
[1:58:23] <Cranky_Construct> As someone who played Smite a ton when it was older? That's acceptable.
[1:58:24] <+Valison> smite is fine, but yeah it looks like ass
[1:58:24] <zepelinnn1> its ok?
[1:58:24] <+CaptainJax> Play super monday night combat Kappa
[1:58:25] <%freezydude> SINGED
[1:58:25] <haidanort> why
[1:58:26] <EndgameContent> Smite looks like pre glow-up League
[1:58:26] <Hellarussian> its fun but the community isnt
[1:58:27] <vingadivo> pat dont try to learn all itens, just what itens mordekaiser uses
[1:58:27] <+beelzebubju> HI REZ STUDIOS LUL
[1:58:27] <%SilentEric> SINGED
[1:58:27] <+Shoosler> Smite is actually really FUN and doesn't look bad
[1:58:27] <Finaldragoon> Smite is also run by Hi-Rez which are just as scummy as Tencent
[1:58:28] <+BIumen> singed :o
[1:58:28] <ALazo> It looks awful because you see it from closer
[1:58:28] <MelodyMedley> Singed time!
[1:58:29] <+Dr_Mooose> I like Smite PepeHands
[1:58:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DOTA IS BEST
[1:58:29] <%freezydude> SINGED YESSS
[1:58:29] <alastorpayne> it kind is to honest
[1:58:29] <+Jontman42> @AngriestPat You can at first focus on looking at what damage you died to, then buying according to that
[1:58:30] <%freezydude> POGGGG
[1:58:31] <%Svanyr> Hirez sucks ass
[1:58:31] <vingadivo> SINGED
[1:58:32] <%PaladinDupre> AWESOMENAUTS?
[1:58:32] <+DarkShadow124> It has Rwby tho
[1:58:32] <axivate_> Oh there it is hahaha
[1:58:32] <Infeirno23> smite is way more interactive
[1:58:33] <%galaxyswirl> THE TRUE TOXIC IS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
[1:58:34] <Imsoverylazy> Smite got desperate enough to sell out to Rooster Teeth
[1:58:34] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat When are you gonna play Battleborn Kappa
[1:58:35] <+Ketsueki_Tera> Hahaha
[1:58:35] <+FrenchTact1cs> smite is pretty good
[1:58:36] <EndgameContent> Also Hi-Rez is run by hacks
[1:58:36] <%SilentEric> Hell yeah Singed!
[1:58:36] <Tucker0603> smite is good, but their way to handle some skins is trash
[1:58:37] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat you can show champ names instead of player names if you change a cfg file to help you learn who champs are
[1:58:39] <LGWPhanto> Fuck I love Singed!
[1:58:40] <%SilentEric> I believe
[1:58:40] <+beelzebubju> SINGED PogChamp
[1:58:41] <nauticalgypsy> I don't think I bought damage the entire time I played s
[1:58:41] <GreenC> i thought he meant smite the ability
[1:58:46] <SGrim> @AngriestPat it's got RWBY skins though, so your corporate overlords might sponsor a stream if you beg for your money. SeemsGood
[1:58:46] <%SilentEric> Singed actually wants Ghost
[1:58:46] <axivate_> Mix mix swirl mix
[1:58:47] <Wan6Saber> oh sheeet jennLOL
[1:58:48] <LGWPhanto> His playstyle is being as much of an asshole as you can
[1:58:49] <+OneGorillionDollars> @AngriestPat I would be more interested in playing smite if it didnt look so hideous
[1:58:49] <haidanort> @AngriestPat how much have you lost to play league

[1:59:46] <Iggeh0> you're facing Mordekaiser in lane
[1:59:51] <Imsoverylazy> You're laning against Morde! Armor is useless against him

[2:00:12] <+CaptainJax> I don't because they FUCKING CHANGED HIM COMPLETELY AGAIN
[2:00:13] <%SilentEric> So SInged is weird. Advice: Turn on poison for just a second or two to save mana. Don't leave it on.
[2:00:13] <BlackermanZX> oh fuck a lee sin
[2:00:14] <+Jekado> pat has LoL chat muted so he isn't going to get any insults through there
[2:00:14] <joylent_blue> YAOI CLAN

[2:00:20] <phrickshun> I'm so happy to come here and see you on Singed
[2:00:22] <+Cymen90> @axivate_ Fighting games looked at Street Fighter 4 and said YES...10 more years of that with NO innovation!
[2:00:23] <%abakkus> is that a tmnt in the bottom right corner
[2:00:26] <%Agami23> hey pat,. have you seen classic mordekaiser? dude was fucked
[2:00:29] <+MinimumPayne> lee sin is probably smurf
[2:00:31] <+DarkShadow124> Oh no
[2:00:32] <%freezydude> AWW YEAH
[2:00:35] <BunnyEmperor> He is weird but in a fun way
[2:00:35] <vingadivo> yes
[2:00:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Guys, Corki had 20 kills last match. Even the most optimized itemization wouldn't have helped much.
[2:00:36] <alwayspronking> singed is very strange and very unique
[2:00:37] <%SilentEric> Run away to kill them
[2:00:38] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> enemy team too stronk gg
[2:00:39] <axivate_> @Cymen90 the big companies did :(
[2:00:39] <+MrTAteMyBalls> singed is the best character though hands down
[2:00:40] <ape_hawk> singed is so good at trolling, its great
[2:00:41] <+Jontman42> @AngriestPat Your job as Singed is to be annoying and get people to chase you
[2:00:46] <ahegotrigger> just run around with your Q on as singed
[2:00:46] <%freezydude> Singed mains die all the time
[2:00:47] <ristos237> singed plays like no one else in the game
[2:00:47] <PowerfulBlackGangs> So, what's the free Ranged DPS?
[2:00:48] <+Jekado> I use to play a pretty decent singe
[2:00:48] <+Emperor_Bad> singed is the only good character
[2:00:51] <theKingRamses> just poop everywhere
[2:00:52] <shiny_prinny> do you like singed tho?
[2:00:54] <%MaddyCaddy> I miss his old passive
[2:00:54] <Verboseobserver> Singed is hilarious when you play him right, he's a good match for Pat
[2:00:55] <Schuhart> Fartmaster
[2:00:55] <Zelretch3000> @AngriestPat just be annoying and not die
[2:00:55] <%CalderGaming> kite them over your trail of damaging bioslime
[2:01:00] <Tunykun> toaster pc
[2:01:00] <%SilentEric> MIX MIX SWIRL MIX
[2:01:02] <lomack42> what do you think of arams?
[2:01:03] <%abakkus> love that "dont be a shithead" is a loadscreen tip
[2:01:03] <EndgameContent> Playing Singed is basically playing a different game
[2:01:04] <+Erzaal> Hey when you can try out Ornn sometime he might be fun for you
[2:01:06] <vingadivo> singed is all about staying away while poison does the damage
[2:01:07] <+Jekado> kinda like Stiches ult
[2:01:08] <ofloofy> singed is fun as fuck
[2:01:09] <Rojahh> tried Malphite yet, that was the hero help me lear league
[2:01:09] <alephalpha> what's singed's gimmick?
[2:01:11] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> singes is hilarious
[2:01:11] <+Cymen90> @axivate_ Nah, sorry. The devs did, too
[2:01:11] <+Jontman42> He's one of the most fun tanks to play
[2:01:13] <ahegotrigger> his fast passive is pretty funny
[2:01:14] <%ThatOneGameTester> you're the main villain from The Master of Disguise
[2:01:15] <+OneGorillionDollars> If it makes you feel better, learning to play singed is to learn all the shit you SHOULDN'T DO on anyone else
[2:01:16] <zenith0111> Like pseudo area denial?
[2:01:16] <shinji_ifrit> being annoying? yes
[2:01:17] <+MinimumPayne> you'll get thje most out of singed in this play level
[2:01:18] <Iam_Dead> gotta hit em with the fart gas
[2:01:20] <%freezydude> @alephalpha it's just running around and poison behind him
[2:01:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Singed is super fun. But he is also hard
[2:01:23] <%SilentEric> I can't wait for his lore update.
[2:01:24] <%SashaStarshine> Singed was the first character made for the game and he's basically exactly th same 10 years later.
[2:01:26] <%VintageSpiffy> mana gives him health!
[2:01:27] <alephalpha> ahhh k
[2:01:28] <+froduck42> singed is like lu bu
[2:01:28] <+yooniversal> singed is the worst champion to play against
[2:01:29] <yamikami13> @AngriestPat i think you be glad/or mad to know that Singed is not meta for years now/
[2:01:29] <+Emperor_Bad> people getting mad going after you and killing themselves never gets old
[2:01:31] <+Glock3bb> Rule #1 of League: Never chase Singed!
[2:01:32] <1matheuw> singed is great for tilting people in both teams
[2:01:35] <%NSwarmlord> Won't be cool when you experience proxy singed for the first time. That's just unfun
[2:01:35] <+froduck42> do not pursue him
[2:01:39] <NiktenKing> Oh shit Pat is playing as Haterade Man
[2:01:40] <%Average1001> @AngriestPat have you seen how stupid complex the new league dude's gonna be?
[2:01:42] <BunnyEmperor> poggers Singed
[2:01:43] <%freezydude> DO NOT PURSUE LU-SINGED
[2:01:44] <pectusumbra> singed is fun. And his gimmick is that he runs around leaving a trail of poison. wants to put down pools of glue and throw people behind him into his poison
[2:01:48] <Swedish_Expert> by playing the game on a monitor
[2:01:51] <Finaldragoon> people who aren't 10 feet away
[2:01:55] <+DarkShadow124> With a moniter
[2:01:56] <%arcaderabbit48> arcaderabbit48 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! People screaming at you to itemize properly are like people screaming at fighting game players to punish their opponent. You don't currently have the knowledge to understand what it means or what to do, but people gonna scream anyway.
[2:01:56] <+Cymen90> LEAGUE PLAYERS: Are there map skins?
[2:01:57] <%arcaderabbit48> arcaderabbit48's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[2:01:58] <shiny_prinny> well, most people are on monitors
[2:02:00] <+ojama1987> you can enlarge the shop by clicking and dragging the corner of the window, no?
[2:02:03] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> pursue Singed always
[2:02:06] <vingadivo> yup
[2:02:06] <Zelretch3000> @AngriestPat IMPORTANT FOR SINGED, YOU GOTTA MANAGE MANA EARLY GAME
[2:02:07] <@JustinianKnight> it is pretty small even on a monitor to be fair
[2:02:08] <+Jontman42> It's not that bad once you see how the kit works in-game
[2:02:10] <%freezydude> @Cymen90 nope.
[2:02:11] <+DarkShadow124> @Cymen90 Only for TfT
[2:02:11] <+Jekado> i just want to play the cat champ who i heard sucks?
[2:02:12] <suikudo> @Cymen90 No
[2:02:13] <1matheuw> its fucking ridiculous icant wait
[2:02:13] <shiny_prinny> @ojama1987 he did that, it didn't make the text bigger
[2:02:15] <EndgameContent> He's way simpler than he seems, oddly enough
[2:02:17] <Infeirno23> @ojama1987 dont start please
[2:02:17] <Palmer_Huntaway> pat click one of the buttons near the item search bar in shop
[2:02:21] <LullabyBird> Singed fast as fuck
[2:02:21] <+maxtheflea> APHELIOS! APHELIOS KANTOS
[2:02:24] <+ojama1987> ah shit, thats pointless
[2:02:24] <Kiari13> make your eyes bigger pat :)
[2:02:24] <shabop> just know that your goal as singed is not to kill the enemy laner, but make them give up on life.
[2:02:25] <+Angrec> dude that metoes clip is proving more and more true. The OH GOD MY NIPPLES one
[2:02:29] <alephalpha> how is hwoever hs is compared to say invoker?
[2:02:30] <EndgameContent> You just need to know the basic properties of five guns
[2:02:32] <darkmind95> Only complex thing about him are his Q and Ult. I still don't know what those do.
[2:02:33] <%dasmause> @AngriestPat they seem to be trying to make the invoker, dota 2 character who combines 3 elements to create custom spells
[2:02:34] <%ThatOneGameTester> That's a bad UX issue imo
[2:02:35] <vingadivo> pat the new character in january is a juggernaut just like darius and garen his name is sett
[2:02:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Aphelios is Jayce on crack or cocaine
[2:02:39] <BlackermanZX> Aphelios is gonna be busted
[2:02:40] <@JustinianKnight> helping the jungle
[2:02:41] <%MaddyCaddy> They're leashing
[2:02:41] <MyNameIsRasus> That's leashing
[2:02:42] <%galaxyswirl> leashing
[2:02:42] <+MinimumPayne> weird that you can edit the chat size in the files beyond max but not the ui
[2:02:42] <alephalpha> oh he's literally invoker
[2:02:43] <+anhero64> the item menu has forsaken pat
[2:02:43] <%wujak> they are leashing
[2:02:45] <%freezydude> They are leashing
[2:02:47] <%PaladinDupre> EDIT THE BIOS DOC
[2:02:47] <zenith0111> So always 2 v 1 singed? Got it
[2:02:48] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> people just showing up think they're going to help
[2:02:48] <Renkage> That's what most people do at the start
[2:02:49] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat Their helping the jungler
[2:02:49] <%RayDaug> That meteos clip was just describing Yuumi before she came out
[2:02:49] <1matheuw> to heal against invades
[2:02:50] <shiny_prinny> they are leashing/protecting the jungler
[2:02:52] <%SilentEric> New guy is the last champion designed by a developer known for his 'unique' champion mechanics.
[2:02:54] <+MinimumPayne> hardcoded so it doesnt look like shit?
[2:02:55] <darkmind95> Bot is LEASHING
[2:02:56] <@JustinianKnight> yea theyre helping
[2:02:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> They are helping your Jungler take the Red Buff.
[2:02:57] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat they help jungler with the kill
[2:02:57] <+Cymen90> @freezydude @DarkShadow124 @suikudo Thanks. Are there different announcers, towers, minions or anything besides hero skins?
[2:02:57] <fragdar> @AngriestPat guard the jungle entry PAT
[2:02:58] <PowerfulBlackGangs> AFK?
[2:03:00] <+Jekado> i don't like this
[2:03:00] <ape_hawk> its fine
[2:03:01] <%MaddyCaddy> They go in a minute
[2:03:01] <dakkster> there needs to be a chat command to explain his issues with the sizing
[2:03:02] <%ItsSansom> That's what leashing is
[2:03:02] <AMajorTom> I've never played this game, but don't worry I'll continue to give you hints as they come to me.
[2:03:03] <MyNameIsRasus> They're leashing
[2:03:05] <MelodyMedley> They're helping the jungler
[2:03:07] <%Sephirios> Pat could learn so much from old Darien matches. feed to win!
[2:03:07] <1matheuw> leashing
[2:03:08] <mistermastergreg> FUCK YOU PAT
[2:03:09] <shinji_ifrit> they're leashing
[2:03:10] <%freezydude> @Cymen90 only for alternate modes or events, and you cant keep them.
[2:03:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It's a BIG BIG leash pat
[2:03:10] <%ItsSansom> They help the jungler with the first camp
[2:03:12] <vingadivo> they're leashing for jungler
[2:03:17] <Schuhart> Time to push like crazy!
[2:03:17] <BunnyEmperor> they are actually doing a good thing LUL
[2:03:19] <+Jekado> i like how dot damage is show now
[2:03:25] <+LethargicRush> gas em
[2:03:26] <+Jekado> ironic
[2:03:27] <Kiari13> monkaS oh god oh fuck
[2:03:28] <phrickshun> Pat using wards already makes him better than most
[2:03:29] <+CaptainJax> @AngriestPat Stop killing the minions as fast as possible
[2:03:32] <%SilentEric> Yep! Just leave it on for a second. You don't need it allways on. Waste of mana.
[2:03:32] <@JustinianKnight> haha really
[2:03:38] <%freezydude> @Cymen90 for example there was a pirate announcer(it was actually the champion gangplank) for when he got his big rework
[2:03:39] <BunnyEmperor> ah damn could have grabbed that lee sin
[2:03:45] <%Conraderino45> wait that lees a smurf
[2:03:46] <TheDyingPride> mid laners don't usually leash these days though
[2:03:49] <%ThatOneGameTester> they're "leashing" for the jungler. a process involving taking damage and/or damaging the jungle monster to help the jungler have a faster or easier clear.
[2:03:50] <@JustinianKnight> hahaha
[2:03:50] <zenith0111> This is actually a lame gimmick... Chat you made it sound cooler I hate you
[2:03:51] <shinji_ifrit> HAH
[2:03:51] <shabop> best part about the knew champion was that the designer for him wanted his strength to vary WITH THE IRL PHASES OF THE MOON
[2:03:51] <vingadivo> hes level 1 there is no grab
[2:03:52] <MrMysteryMask> nice work

[2:05:08] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Pat your green item is a potion that refills whenever you go back to base
[2:05:08] <Imsoverylazy> Its a really good potion
[2:05:09] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[2:05:10] <%SilentEric> Reusable potion. It refills every time you back.
[2:05:13] <1matheuw> it refils when you go back to base
[2:05:13] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat that potion refills whener you base
[2:05:14] <%ThatOneGameTester> It's a refillable potion that refills each tiem you enter the shop, for free
[2:05:16] <Verboseobserver> Green pot refills
[2:05:17] <Schuhart> Every time you are in base it refills
[2:05:17] <MelodyMedley> It's an estus
[2:05:18] <Imsoverylazy> And your starting item improves potions
[2:05:18] <NachoCanDandyRavage> it refills when you get back to spawn
[2:05:19] <shabop> it is an upgrade to the potion younhave
[2:05:19] <shiny_prinny> ok so that item you started with gives stats if you do well, and loses stats if you die
[2:05:20] <@JustinianKnight> it does

[2:09:44] <qaaj> @kevlarkoala After a buncha kit rework, they gave him his current kit with his visual upgrade.
[2:09:44] <+Jekado> the ballz on the lee sin
[2:09:45] <Jarvanii> oh god where's the mana in this build
[2:09:46] <%freezydude> @zenith0111 his Q costs mana to use so yeah but his passive is that for every bit of mana he has it also gives him some health, i think the ratio is 2:1 or something.
[2:09:48] <%VintageSpiffy> I can't trust a Singed build with no Rod of Ages or Arcgangel's.
[2:09:50] <1matheuw> eat cheat chat
[2:09:53] <vingadivo> pat the potion also restores mana, mana is the blue bar bellow health
[2:09:54] <%freezydude> so a lot of singed build mana items.
[2:09:58] <%freezydude> like Rod of ages or Archangels.
[2:09:58] <%SashaStarshine> @kevlarkoala Morde is an AP version of Darius, but instead of the execute he teleports people to a 1v1 dimension
[2:09:59] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> lol singed; now with shoes!
[2:10:00] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Chimeraelite a character built around running away, perfect lol
[2:10:01] <+Jekado> what does singed ult do now?

[2:10:13] <ahegotrigger> are you doing a frozen singed build? because thats pretty good on him
[2:10:13] <zenith0111> @freezydude Oh okay I see
[2:10:14] <+kevlarkoala> ah so no more op morde ghosts? shame
[2:10:19] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat 1 kill is worth approx. 15 cs

[2:12:25] <N1netbattler> He pulls you so he can die faster duh
[2:12:25] <%boxofhooligans> Singed best champ to NOT last hit, poison does the job. then Nasus can teach him how to CS.
[2:12:25] <MyNameIsRasus> let him pull you
[2:12:25] <%baronblank> baronblank subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Now that you've played league a bit, are there any characters you want to be in the league fighting game/you think could work really well in it?
[2:12:27] <%baronblank> baronblank's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[2:12:29] <+HyraFukit> To get free damage because you shouldnt fight under his tower @AngriestPat

[2:12:33] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Singed is the patron saint of all cowards, wins fights by running away
[2:12:33] <+chase959> Pat a good item on singed would be the Tear of the goddess. It'll give you mana as your Q is running
[2:12:34] <%XxBTExX> he wants a Riot employees to fart in his face. so he's practicing
[2:12:41] <BlackermanZX> This mord is so lost

[2:13:05] <ape_hawk> NOW YOU GET IT
[2:13:07] <+runman5223> THIS IS A TDM
[2:13:07] <+MinimumPayne> watch for lee
[2:13:07] <zamzoph> PunOko
[2:13:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, that's Singed
[2:13:09] <%freezydude> Yeah singed does that
[2:13:09] <@JustinianKnight> shit goin on bot
[2:13:09] <+CaptainJax> hoes mad x48
[2:13:11] <goddamndavid> why you have to be mad?
[2:13:11] <1matheuw> thats singed
[2:13:12] <+Peacockney> why did Mord ward that
[2:13:12] <vingadivo> singed is like that yeah
[2:13:13] <+MinimumPayne> they throw a ward
[2:13:13] <ybQuinny> pjSalt
[2:13:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> @Nightgls gnite
[2:13:16] <ahegotrigger> Lee sin is there
[2:13:16] <+MinimumPayne> lee sin can jump on those
[2:13:16] <+dach33zman> is this just a bad match up for mord or his pat just shitting on him?
[2:13:17] <+Jontman42> It's a hidden passive on Singed that you get mad
[2:13:18] <+LethargicRush> fat cash
[2:13:20] <+Grayhammatter> basically free money
[2:13:21] <OldManDeckardCain> Saltman is learning
[2:13:22] <%SilentEric> Pat, the build won't tell you this, but because you have so many kills, upgrade the first item you have. It's better the more kills you have.
[2:13:22] <+Jekado> fucking party bot again
[2:13:22] <%LaughingCatt> some shit just went down
[2:13:23] <ristos237> @AngriestPat something i would really recommend turning on is show ability cost under interface so you can easily tell how much mana an ability takes so you dont accidentally run out and screw yourself over
[2:13:23] <NJigglypuff> wait thats mord?
[2:13:25] <Owlboy7> CANNONS LUL
[2:13:25] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat your Corrupting Potion gives bonus damage while it's healing you
[2:13:30] <%freezydude> Pat they literally made singed laugh when he flings an opponent, he never did that before they did that because he's literally the asshole troll champion lol
[2:13:42] <%bevyrage> mord's new kit makes him have a hard time with singed, so it's bad matchup and also being a scrub?
[2:13:43] <zamzoph> Wow, Pat really is a League streamer now. Got a new overlay and everything
[2:13:47] <ButterMyBrisket> LUL
[2:13:50] <shiny_prinny> ignite
[2:13:55] <+LethargicRush> hmmmmmmmmmm
[2:13:56] <zenith0111> Should you just avoid Singed? Like if hr gets close just smack him?
[2:13:56] <Kiari13> monkaS
[2:14:00] <OldManDeckardCain> is it tho
[2:14:00] <%bevyrage> ah damn

[2:14:03] <+DarkShadow124> You had ghost
[2:14:03] <ckkc1> 'fine'
[2:14:04] <PowerfulBlackGangs> 3-1
[2:14:06] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> aww
[2:14:07] <+Cymen90> No Pat be ANGRY
[2:14:07] <+VashyronM> How are is League?
[2:14:09] <+anhero64> machine learning activited
[2:14:10] <+Glock3bb> Should have ulted.
[2:14:10] <+Peacockney> he ran out of mana for ult
[2:14:10] <MelodyMedley> Good for him
[2:14:11] <%SoFarFetched> should have side stepped
[2:14:11] <Kiari13> Clap
[2:14:12] <%freezydude> I would've popped ghost
[2:14:13] <%THATGUY_789> u got got
[2:14:15] <+Vegaburd> nt tho
[2:14:18] <vingadivo> no mana
[2:14:18] <%bevyrage> dodging to the side would have likely eaten an auto attack though
[2:14:19] <Twoiis> Had a lot of options.
[2:14:19] <+LethargicRush> shoulda dudda fudda
[2:14:20] <Zedimonx5> Are you sure that you aren’t fighting Past Pat here?
[2:14:20] <+MinimumPayne> u had low mana anyway
[2:14:23] <%GingaNZ> ran out of mana
[2:14:23] <Iggeh0> he ran out of mana
[2:14:25] <Owlboy7> should have move left LUL
[2:14:26] <%ThatOneGameTester> many things could have been done. but it's ok
[2:14:27] <%thesnugglelord> now morde is worth money again
[2:14:31] <+Vegaburd> he had mana at the start
[2:14:32] <vingadivo> next time remember to use ghost for speed
[2:14:32] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> don't forget summoner spells
[2:14:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat that staff is super good for singed, it slows down people in the fart gas
[2:14:38] <Zelretch3000> GOLD RESET, PAT 200 IQ
[2:14:38] <%KevinsLunchbox> if he had ulted first he wouldn't have run out of mana chat
[2:14:40] <zamzoph> should've git gud
[2:14:41] <%Dr_DangerPhD> is frozen mallet or liandry's torment usually a core item with singed?
[2:14:42] <MelodyMedley> Pat's fighting himself from the past
[2:14:43] <Nightgls> Wow, this is league of legends? I expected a bit more, tbh
[2:14:45] <+LethargicRush> i like how mord has a unique attack animation for attacking a tower
[2:14:49] <Infeirno23> chat is the salty teammates pat would mute LUL
[2:14:50] <%arcaderabbit48> @zenith0111 The big key is to not run after him. Singed wants a long, prolonged fight where he can just jump around and poison you. You need a way to prevent him from getting close, or otherwise ignore him safely.
[2:14:53] <%galaxyswirl> no PHD
[2:14:56] <TheDyingPride> liandries, yes
[2:14:58] <shabop> dont jinx it
[2:14:58] <+Jekado> you jinxed it
[2:14:59] <phrickshun> I think you should have saved fling for after you got out of that morde ult.
[2:15:01] <%SilentEric> Pat, upgrade your fist item since you are doing well. The build doesn't tell you to because it depends on how many kills you get!
[2:15:01] <shiny_prinny> CRAZY TALK
[2:15:01] <Kiari13> monkaS

[2:25:07] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat he hasnt changed in 10 years
[2:25:07] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat pretty sure that's still his OG model in release
[2:25:07] <todcomod> Singed is my favorite too
[2:25:07] <%bevyrage> it's criminal because he's committed war crimes to this day
[2:25:07] <+anhero64> singed is a boomer

[2:25:10] <simulationbard> He's one of the og champs
[2:25:11] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Singed is considered a beginner Champ! For some reason, I dunno!
[2:25:11] <%SashaStarshine> Singed was the first champion ever designed
[2:25:13] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat why are you standing up
[2:25:13] <vingadivo> a lot of broken characters are very old
[2:25:14] <%blastazoid26> Singed is old at
[2:25:14] <1matheuw> byebye
[2:25:19] <ape_hawk> singed is basically just pat but older
[2:25:23] <ChrisM341> 2 seconds later
[2:25:24] <Imsoverylazy> I wanna see Pat play exclusively Yasuo
[2:25:24] <%ThatOneGameTester> you have loads of blue essence and can buy a champ or 6 if you like
[2:25:26] <todcomod> Lol Singed isn't broken
[2:25:26] <+Rosie_Odonald> even cheaper bc u got him in chest
[2:25:28] <+VektorTroika> 2009 Pizzafeet-era champs are the best
[2:25:30] <%SashaStarshine> Singed is just Braum on heroin
[2:25:33] <ShineTheDiamond> How is everyone's Saturday going?
[2:25:36] <%Sephirios> Pats fault that my team will be sooo mad, just had to play a ranked as Singed now

[2:25:51] <Blank9> ice bird's too fun
[2:25:59] <Imsoverylazy> Guys can we hype Yasuo? It would be fun to watch Pat suffer through trying to learn him
[2:26:17] <%Sephirios> Yasuo and Vayne
[2:26:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> i don't like Yasuo so i'll leave you to that LUL
[2:26:22] <%arcaderabbit48> @Imsoverylazy No, no, save that for poor Woolie

[2:26:49] <%s_xylocalsingles> @lethargicrush he’s still a good boy tho
[2:27:12] <MessyBristles> i cant wait till pat runs into a teemo
[2:27:13] <weeamood> Illaoi is the biggest Woolie bait in League
[2:27:14] <auspiciousdgg> Why is my favourite streamer playing this pleb game?
[2:27:18] <Blank9> if you want to see pat struggle, make him try graves
[2:27:18] <+LethargicRush> he is, he deserves it.
[2:27:20] <Imsoverylazy> Kled then? He's basically Pat incarnate in League
[2:27:20] <+jt427> just have a watch of old meme league videos and shitposts for pat to learn champs
[2:27:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> i want to see pat play jayce or something really simple.
[2:27:22] <%freezydude> @weeamood woolie knows about illaoi, he mispronounced her name when he was listing champions he would want on the fighting game
[2:27:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @weeamood But VI exists
[2:27:32] <+LethargicRush> also we need a all Thresh match
[2:27:33] <mistermastergreg> @auspiciousdgg because he's a fuck

[2:37:00] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Top Teemo is frustrating to play against
[2:37:01] <+Tennochief> it will take 9 years to unlock everyone for free
[2:37:01] <%arcaderabbit48> @Who_lio42 The PTSD is just in one of his skins. His current lore isn't very in depth because Riot has no idea where to put him ro what to do with him ever sicne the retcon

[2:37:24] <+gryffon95> and boy is it
[2:37:24] <Finchit> It was a copy of dota 1 bruh
[2:37:26] <%XxBTExX> it was Dota until Dota decided not to do Dota
[2:37:26] <%LaughingCatt> Half the champs are just Warcraft 3 guys yeah
[2:37:27] <+Cymen90> Dota is the ONLY REAL ONE
[2:37:28] <+korean_random> pretty much

[2:37:33] <Iggeh0> he really loves the word incestous
[2:37:33] <ButterMyBrisket> it really is
[2:37:33] <%linSP> dota 1 is a copy of WARCRAFT
[2:37:33] <+Tennochief> because it is
[2:37:34] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Oh you think so, huh?
[2:37:34] <+anhero64> great value DOTA

[2:37:39] <pectusumbra> Q then E
[2:37:40] <%galaxyswirl> E is a must get
[2:37:40] <+HimRoman> Q
[2:37:41] <+HyraFukit> @AngriestPat Original Kits get sidelaned into hell because they trash normal shit.

[2:37:47] <shiny_prinny> E is passive poison damage
[2:37:48] <+l33t_j4gu4r> original ideas dont pay the bills
[2:37:53] <+Tennochief> the guy who helped hype this game ACTUALLY stabbed DOTA 1 in the back for it
[2:37:53] <EndgameContent> POTION
[2:37:54] <MyNameIsRasus> i
[2:37:55] <vingadivo> pat teemo Q blinds your enemies so they cant auto atack

[2:37:57] <+PapaSnooch> Its a passive poison on autos
[2:37:57] <%freezydude> It's a passive
[2:37:58] <NephiStreams> big oof
[2:37:58] <Tunykun> just get e level 1 and run at enemy
[2:37:59] <BlackermanZX> Its actually just a passive
[2:37:59] <Ids560> well yeah cuz league ripped off dota which is discount warcraft which is ripoff warhammer which is tolkien but edgier
[2:37:59] <+Glock3bb> @AngriestPat If you want ripoffs, you should check out Shen's skins after this match.
[2:38:01] <Iggeh0> it's always active
[2:38:02] <%SilentEric> Warhammer was the original
[2:38:02] <hntronium> Pat loves the passive
[2:38:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat All of your auto attacks poison people now. FOREVER
[2:38:02] <$Remery_> @AngriestPat Do you like Yordles more than Lalfells?
[2:38:03] <+Cymen90> Dota literally MADE the genre.
[2:38:03] <pectusumbra> it's just DoTs on all your attacks
[2:38:04] <+FrenchTact1cs> haraas q all day
[2:38:04] <Kiari13> monkaS
[2:38:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Your attacks poison enemies
[2:38:07] <+MinimumPayne> level up enough he can
[2:38:08] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat teemo only has one active you want and thats q
[2:38:08] <+Beruptor> the dudes that made dota 1 split up and made league so there are a lot of similarities in the old champions
[2:38:08] <+Jekado> you can turn it off
[2:38:09] <%moogleboy1984> Pat, don't forget LoL is Sam's Choice DotA which was Sam's Choice Warcraft 3
[2:38:10] <%nmaten> read his passive
[2:38:10] <+Pendragwn> @Tennochief that guy was super fucking smart then
[2:38:11] <%SilentEric> Its a passive.
[2:38:11] <Schuhart> Blind is crazy annoying, and if you pump it up, it hits like a truck.
[2:38:11] <+Jekado> for... reasons
[2:38:12] <Narukamiiii> When you have so many playable characters you gonna end up seeing familiar stuff
[2:38:12] <+VashyronM> I mean, it's all based off of Warcraft 3, sooo.

[2:40:12] <+VektorTroika> one of these days you should probably swap out Aery for i dunno, precision or something

[2:40:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Teemo is like Techies/Meepo in Dota
[2:40:41] <Srthunda> Pat, this is why he has a satan skin
[2:40:42] <%Vegaburd> depends on build path

[2:46:04] <BaronVonProlix> the BLIND monk
[2:46:05] <leonegaming6> LEE SIN IS BLIND BUT PAT CANT SEE HIM LULW
[2:46:05] <%Stan_Van01> The biggest tunnel vision
[2:46:05] <vonpimpenstein> see lin is invis in the eye of the boomer
[2:46:06] <vingadivo> shrooms are invisible after a second and should be used as landmines
[2:46:06] <+Jontman42> @AngriestPat You can press A and then left click the ground to attack the closest unit to your cursor, makes it easier to move and attack sometimes
[2:46:06] <Darkmega97> Lee is blind but Pat is blinder
[2:46:07] <+jt427> lmao
[2:46:08] <+VektorTroika> THEY CAN'T SEE ME WITH THIS BLINDFOLD ON
[2:46:08] <OldManDeckardCain> blinded by his greed

[2:46:15] <+keigatide> Run fast
[2:46:16] <+Cymen90> How often do you check the map?
[2:46:20] <BlackermanZX> Ult is busted if used properly
[2:46:20] <%ThatOneGameTester> Turrets have "true sight" which grants vision of stealth units, like your mushrooms
[2:46:20] <vingadivo> shrooms are landmines pat use them like traps
[2:46:21] <darkmind95> They Are Invisible Traps!
[2:46:26] <shiny_prinny> You can place traps in the bushes for enemies
[2:46:27] <93lobo> Place shrooms on top if each other they pounce
[2:46:27] <%SilentEric> Ult is multiple charges of traps.
[2:46:27] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You do not have cap on number of traps you can place, don't let them stay at max
[2:46:28] <Englishstew> you can put a bunch of mushrooms down at the same time btw
[2:46:29] <+kingofcinders> @AngriestPat Pat, if you throw one Shroom on another, they bounce.
[2:46:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Shroom bushes and shit
[2:46:31] <Imsoverylazy> Pat you have negative awareness
[2:46:41] <%SilentEric> They last a while. Put them in bushes and river.
[2:46:44] <Narukamiiii> They're landmines , just throw them all over the place @AngriestPat
[2:46:45] <%Who_lio42> its LP tax Kappa
[2:46:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat keep spacing
[2:46:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat If you throw a mine on top of another mine, it bounces
[2:46:57] <%freezydude> Pat space away.
[2:47:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There are aspects of his decision making process that make no sense to me
[2:47:05] <+LethargicRush> pffft
[2:47:05] <phrickshun> I feel like morde can just ult you to death...
[2:47:06] <pectusumbra> you are playing a keepaway character
[2:47:06] <%linSP> hes got flash
[2:47:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> Damage turns off your W btw @AngriestPat
[2:47:08] <%Svanyr> Oh god he keeps going into melee
[2:47:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And it's not like he hasn't played MOBAs before

[2:47:12] <%Deano8817> F
[2:47:14] <therealtacopancakes> use your w
[2:47:14] <Mister_McDerp> you keep getting too close
[2:47:15] <+Jontman42> good flash
[2:47:16] <Naphtali61> Your ult are landmines that you should put towards the edges of the lane and chokepoints to keep you safe
[2:47:18] <pectusumbra> he's gief and you're dalhsim
[2:47:18] <Darkmega97> He does a lot of damage. Procedes to run towards the damage
[2:47:21] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> W O W
[2:47:23] <+jiggy_snipe> use your w to run away
[2:47:25] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat if you like placing invisible mines you should play techies in dota 2
[2:47:27] <Tennochief> he's lucky that Morde is terrible
[2:47:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> Man Pat's confidence is admirable
[2:47:28] <BlackermanZX> R has multiple charges too

[2:47:29] <+Peacockney> @AngriestPat Line up the sides of the lane with shrooms

[2:48:04] <+keigatide> Godamn it, I play in low diamond and this kills me. I should stop watching now.
[2:48:08] <%TG_Cid11> @QuadraticGravity if he ever plays it
[2:48:08] <Tennochief> """hammer"""
[2:48:11] <Darkmega97> Patrick is the kind of guy to have a gun and try to fight the other guy up close
[2:48:11] <%freezydude> hey pat press A then click.
[2:48:13] <%Reevesypoo> dont worry so much about outright killing him
[2:48:18] <%Reevesypoo> Just annoy him lol
[2:48:20] <%NSwarmlord> @AngriestPat you should press C, the circle around you is your attack range
[2:48:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> you would normally level Q instead of E so you can trade and poke him out fro ma distance
[2:48:22] <Imsoverylazy> @AngriestPat Treat this like You're Dhalsim and He's Zangief
[2:48:25] <+Peacockney> PUT THEM IN BUSHES.
[2:48:25] <Jarvanii> the mushrooms reveal enemies when they walk on them
[2:48:26] <pectusumbra> throw mushrooms into bushes for vision
[2:48:28] <+FrenchTact1cs> your taking a lot of minion damage from chases
[2:48:30] <%mostundesired> monkaS
[2:48:30] <Jarvanii> so you can use them as wards kidna
[2:48:31] <OldManDeckardCain> Why is Pat doing an impression of Woolie playing DS when he's playing League Kappa
[2:48:36] <%Agami23> put mushrooms in bushes, it makes it so they are revealed on the map
[2:48:39] <BlackermanZX> Try using A for checking your current auto attack range
[2:48:40] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> Thanks for the HahaPoint @birdigalore
[2:48:41] <+Jekado> should but mushing the bush
[2:48:42] <Rhinoprotoss> WHY

[2:49:02] <%Gogogolem> Thats not how you use your ult
[2:49:03] <%NSwarmlord> Press C
[2:49:03] <%Vegaburd> out of range?
[2:49:03] <+LethargicRush> Thwomp
[2:49:03] <BunnyEmperor> what were you trying to do
[2:49:06] <+Jontman42> Too far probably
[2:49:09] <+Jekado> miss clicked?
[2:49:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Stop fighting him. Back down and lame it out
[2:49:10] <+Peacockney> You gotta kite Morde.
[2:49:11] <Decimated_body> wah wah
[2:49:13] <vingadivo> you weren't in range
[2:49:13] <%bevyrage> place mushrooms as traps, not as grenades
[2:49:15] <auspiciousdgg> Pat "Inting" Boivin
[2:49:16] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat So this is the problem with Teemo. You fail to stomp early and you get stomped
[2:49:16] <Iggeh0> place traps pre emptively, dont use them in middle of a fight
[2:49:17] <%freezydude> pat just put your shrooms as traps.
[2:49:17] <%aster_d> he's a learnin
[2:49:18] <Darkmega97> Omae wa mou shindeiru
[2:49:19] <shiny_prinny> it was probably too far so he walked up to throw it
[2:49:21] <hntronium> Stop feeding him pat
[2:49:21] <+Jekado> the throwing mushroom is weird now
[2:49:22] <%NSwarmlord> That shows your attack range
[2:49:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> teemo is hit and run not a face tank
[2:49:30] <+Grayhammatter> put your shrooms in bushes?
[2:49:33] <+Jekado> he is playing teemo like he's suppose to
[2:49:33] <vingadivo> pat press A plus click to auto atack without aiming
[2:49:34] <+jiggy_snipe> yea there traps
[2:49:34] <%galaxyswirl> in a fight you only have auto attacks and q to fight @AngriestPat
[2:49:34] <Imsoverylazy> You gotta be lame and spam ranged shit he can't counter to win as Teemo
[2:49:35] <+Rosie_Odonald> put ur shrooms in bush
[2:49:36] <pectusumbra> and yeah, you have to lay the traps in advance, then lure him to doom
[2:49:38] <mistermastergreg> KEE´P FEEDING HIM PAT
[2:49:40] <+jiggy_snipe> stock pile them in bushes
[2:49:41] <NiktenKing> In river and bushes so you don't get got
[2:49:42] <TheHeroAppears> when are we teaching pat A key
[2:49:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Teemo is Dhalsim
[2:49:44] <Decimated_body> little hamster getting f*cked
[2:49:48] <%bevyrage> fill bushes with shrooms, they work like aggressive wards.
[2:49:48] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[2:49:48] <Tennochief> you're a tunnel rat, Pat
[2:49:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 49m.
[2:49:48] <phrickshun> put the mushrooms on the sides of the lane, minions will keep detonating them too early
[2:49:49] <shiny_prinny> yeah the mushrooms are invisible
[2:49:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> You can throw a mine onto another mine to extend your throwing range. They bounce off each other
[2:49:50] <Iggeh0> perfect
[2:49:52] <ButterMyBrisket> there you go
[2:49:53] <someyounguy1> is this pats true form, small, angry, toxic
[2:49:53] <thunderrex> bushes are good
[2:49:54] <Renkage> @AngriestPat You can also bounce shrooms on other shrooms to increase their distance to which they are thrown
[2:49:55] <vingadivo> pat press A please
[2:49:55] <+greatersea> I know like nothing about how to play this game, but volibear looks interesting
[2:49:55] <BlackermanZX> Try using A for auto attacks if ya can
[2:49:58] <+Bricespresso> they last on the map for some time so you can make a mine feild
[2:49:59] <+Jekado> teemo needs setup time so you have free reign of an area
[2:49:59] <zenith0111> Using your zoning tools Pat
[2:50:00] <%galaxyswirl> there you go
[2:50:01] <MyNameIsRasus> That's it
[2:50:02] <%Gogogolem> Pat this characters job is to be a giant cunt not fight.
[2:50:02] <+jiggy_snipe> you can put multiples in one bush too
[2:50:05] <theKingRamses> does pat know about moving with A
[2:50:05] <%bevyrage> now you're doing the teemo
[2:50:07] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat they're already invisible so you don't necessarily have to put them in bushes
[2:50:09] <shabop> you really dont want to get in an extended fight with morde. poke and run
[2:50:11] <7th_JusticeFlame> Or right in front of you so he passed threw them as you walk awa
[2:50:12] <%TG_Cid11> You want to make them not want to go anywhere with out them thinking they will take damage
[2:50:12] <+Jekado> what is the max shrooms out you can have now?
[2:50:12] <+PapaSnooch> CS LUL
[2:50:14] <%absolutely_naught> 37 farm at 12 mins O_o
[2:50:18] <pectusumbra> putting them in bushes gives vision
[2:50:18] <Tennochief> AMBUSH
[2:50:21] <%Gogogolem> also stacking traps is good
[2:50:23] <shiny_prinny> then when you run, lead them to the bushes
[2:50:24] <%galaxyswirl> @Jekado ifinite
[2:50:25] <Tucker0603> mushrooms stealth after a bit
[2:50:26] <pectusumbra> you may want to go back and put one in the river bush as well
[2:50:29] <+Grayhammatter> gonna get big ambushed
[2:50:29] <flyingtentaclemonster> place some in river to avoid ganks
[2:50:30] <93lobo> place them in middle of lane and near river
[2:50:31] <%SilentEric> Trap river and the enemy jungle.
[2:50:35] <+DrT0M_> @AngriestPat shrooms give a little vision too, use them in places you ward to counter the jungler ganking
[2:50:38] <NiktenKing> Teemo is like a zone all in himself. If they see you, they have to think about the approach once you have your ult
[2:50:42] <%bevyrage> and just like that you won an exchange
[2:50:42] <+Rosie_Odonald> put in river bush when u can, can help warn u if you about to get ganked
[2:50:43] <+keigatide> He's getting ti!
[2:50:51] <%Deano8817> stop being brave, be huge coward
[2:50:53] <MessyBristles> the shrooms also slow so lead them to it if yuou need to get away
[2:50:53] <+Jekado> @galaxyswirl they expire over time tho?
[2:50:59] <%SilentEric> @AngriestPat Imagine being a jungler and running into teemo mushrooms all the time. Put mushrooms in the enemy jungle.
[2:51:01] <Rhinoprotoss> The 2 poison characters are big cowards
[2:51:04] <+DarkShadow124> So Neeko is a mage not a jungler?
[2:51:06] <+xxAwaken> i have no clue whats going on PogChamp
[2:51:06] <Tennochief> Jebaited
[2:51:07] <+the_drummaestro> put shrooms in the river to ward for ganks
[2:51:12] <Kuubyy> good
[2:51:13] <Narukamiiii> He just needs more practice with ranged champions
[2:51:13] <+zinris> YEYEYE
[2:51:14] <%galaxyswirl> @Jekado yea
[2:51:15] <+LethargicRush> there we go
[2:51:16] <Rosy_Joan> clap
[2:51:16] <+Jekado> with teemo always be warding and shrooming
[2:51:18] <vingadivo> you want to poke and walk away pat
[2:51:19] <+zinris> play the long game
[2:51:21] <vingadivo> nice pat
[2:51:22] <%ThatOneGameTester> now you're getting it
[2:51:22] <auspiciousdgg> Why is Pat laning against a Dark Souls boss
[2:51:24] <Imsoverylazy> You just gotta poke and annoy Pat. Teemo isn't about all ins or mechanical skill. He's all about mind games
[2:51:25] <Hellarussian> is this an any% Teemo Speedrun?
[2:51:26] <+DarkShadow124> lol

[2:51:34] <+Peacockney> lol
[2:51:36] <shiny_prinny> yeah that stealth doesn't work in combat well
[2:51:41] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Mushrooms you place in death realm get stuck there
[2:51:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Yo have to hit him Pat
[2:51:42] <Decimated_body> RUN AND HIDE
[2:51:42] <%arcaderabbit48> @DarkShadow124 She is a mage that is sometimes played as a jungler. Junglers aren't really a dedicated role in the same way a Tank or a Mage is
[2:51:46] <%absolutely_naught> when he sends you to the shadow realm there is no point in trying to run. Fight him while circling him
[2:51:52] <hntronium> Stop being brave pat
[2:51:53] <+aversal_ammar> YOU HAVE TO HIT THEM WOOLIE
[2:51:55] <vingadivo> pat press A to auto atack without having to aim
[2:51:56] <hntronium> BECOME COWARD
[2:51:58] <%Deano8817> teemo requires maximum cowardice
[2:51:59] <+Cymen90> DON'T RUN
[2:51:59] <+Jekado> if your stealthed you can still get hit btw
[2:52:02] <Bust_ER> this is so weird
[2:52:05] <+LethargicRush> alwas run
[2:52:07] <vingadivo> Press A pat
[2:52:08] <%SilentEric> So Pat, your W is more movement speed if you haven't taken damage. Activating it gives the movement speed even if you have taken damage.
[2:52:12] <%ThatOneGameTester> hmm, might be good to have auto attacks on if you end up standing like that LUL Kappa
[2:52:12] <%arcaderabbit48> @DarkShadow124 Or more specifically, its a role that technically anyone can fill to varying degrees of success
[2:52:13] <Decimated_body> BIG coward
[2:52:14] <chromatic_shadow> Does QSS still work on clearing Morde's ult?
[2:52:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> Pats inting on Teemo POG
[2:52:19] <Narukamiiii> He's way too ahead at this point, Pat doesn't stand a chance, all you can do is practice the champion
[2:52:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> Toss a mushroom on another mushroom to double your throwing range
[2:52:23] <+mcjimbo12> all the characters used to be this weird. teemo is like the weirdest character left in the game

[2:52:58] <%Birdigalore> sry for caps
[2:52:59] <+Jekado> problem is i feel like teemo needs to be in more team fights as disruption
[2:53:06] <+DarkShadow124> @arcaderabbit48 Ah ok. Was wondering cuz her spotlight vid seemed focused on the jungle. Quit league back in Season 5
[2:53:08] <+mcjimbo12> generally speaking a single auto attack will do more damage than a Q because of the poison on the auto attack
[2:53:09] <Naphtali61> play more footsies bait out his q
[2:53:15] <%ThatOneGameTester> bad trades, just farm under turret and gain exp

[2:53:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> dont help pat... you are making it worse
[2:53:25] <%RabbiKing> oh no pat is that type of teemo player
[2:53:26] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:53:28] <Narukamiiii> He has an item that give his spells a slow effect @AngriestPat
[2:53:28] <1matheuw> MOM PAT IS INTING
[2:53:29] <OldManDeckardCain> THE REAL SALT BEGINS NOW
[2:53:30] <%SashaStarshine> This lane looks like a Happy Tree Friends episode
[2:53:32] <hntronium> I don't understand what you're trying to do pat
[2:53:33] <%SilentEric> @AngriestPat So Pat, your W is more movement speed if you haven't taken damage. Activating it gives the movement speed even if you have taken damage.
[2:53:34] <zepelinnn1> just run into him 4Head
[2:53:36] <zenith0111> Wow Pat sucks as Teemo
[2:53:36] <Tennochief> buy wards
[2:53:38] <pectusumbra> it's time for you to go to other lanes actually, you need to eat others to get stronger
[2:53:39] <ralphfromdk> Well, at least you know you did a bad :D
[2:53:41] <Monkroot> don't go in with Teemo, let your poison and mines to the job
[2:53:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> pat. morde outranges you significantly with his smash
[2:53:45] <+jiggy_snipe> this top is inting D:<
[2:53:48] <Iggeh0> he has an item that slows you down when he hits you with abilities
[2:53:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Blue Item Mordekaiser has slows you when he hits you with abilities
[2:53:51] <Decimated_body> get BOOTS
[2:53:52] <93lobo> use w to get to lane fastPat W is a speed booster
[2:53:55] <+Pendragwn> @hntronium you don't understand what learning to play the character is?!?
[2:53:57] <+darquezsmith> why
[2:54:00] <vingadivo> pat try to auto him when he is busy atacking a minion
[2:54:03] <+Jekado> yeah teemo is very mobility based
[2:54:06] <%arcaderabbit48> @DarkShadow124 She is meant to eb a mid lane mage, but is often played Top and sometimes Jungle. The game has a slight problem with characters being taken outside their designated lane, to varying degrees of success and toxicity.
[2:54:07] <Tennochief> If there were a way to get all champs free forever, I'd jump back into this game in a heartbeat
[2:54:14] <%Fenrirlives> has Pat played More yet?
[2:54:14] <OldManDeckardCain> isn't this pat's first teemo game LUL
[2:54:18] <+jiggy_snipe> enemy minions
[2:54:19] <%Gogogolem> creep trigger shrroms
[2:54:20] <pectusumbra> minions blow them up
[2:54:20] <%Deano8817> minions
[2:54:20] <Mister_McDerp> cause its a mine
[2:54:21] <BlackermanZX> Minions trigger it too
[2:54:21] <shiny_prinny> a minion ran into it
[2:54:22] <Renkage> Triggers on minions as well
[2:54:22] <Hellarussian> you threw it on top of him?
[2:54:22] <%freezydude> it hit the enemy minions
[2:54:23] <pectusumbra> it's a landmine
[2:54:23] <mistermastergreg> I can't believe Pat is still a fuck
[2:54:23] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why bushes are better
[2:54:24] <Tennochief> FailFish FailFish FailFish FailFish
[2:54:25] <%Gogogolem> why you don't put them in middle of lane
[2:54:25] <%ThatOneGameTester> it blows up on minions or champions
[2:54:28] <vingadivo> minions
[2:54:28] <%Fenrirlives> *Morde yet?

[2:54:33] <Narukamiiii> It acts like a landmine @AngriestPat

[2:54:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:54:35] <%QuadraticGravity> READ YOUR ABILITIES ALL THE WAY THROUGH
[2:54:35] <NiktenKing> They bounce
[2:54:35] <%skizzuto> the mushrooms bounce off each other for more range
[2:54:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> They Bounce
[2:54:35] <+keigatide> hAs he not figured out not only minions trigger it?
[2:54:36] <Tunykun> they bounce off each other
[2:54:36] <+Jekado> enemies trigger the bomb why you dont' throw them in main lane
[2:54:37] <+Jontman42> They bounce off each other too
[2:54:37] <Decimated_body> I hate teemo so this is satisfying
[2:54:39] <Renkage> You can bounce mushrooms on mushrooms to increase their distance
[2:54:40] <%SilentEric> They bounce for more distance.
[2:54:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its a landmine pat
[2:54:40] <vingadivo> the bounce

[2:54:44] <ofloofy> Pats reaction to the shroom bouncing mechanic LUL
[2:54:44] <Fancypants25> they bounce off eachother

[2:54:51] <Tennochief> GAY FROG
[2:54:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> The mushrooms bounce off each other to extend your throwing range
[2:54:55] <%absolutely_naught> @AngriestPat CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE: your shrooms do not stack damage. Putting one immediately next to another is not a good idea.
[2:54:55] <pectusumbra> no
[2:54:56] <%Agami23> explain why you are confused?

[3:05:58] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat you're the highest level person on your team, most of them can't fight you alone right now
[3:05:58] <%rj1771> Can't wait to hear Pat explaining to Woolie how much of a dick-nugget Teemo is on the podcast. xD
[3:05:59] <NiktenKing> There's poison... and then there's TOXIC
[3:06:01] <Klefth> Put mushrooms in the jungle exits, lol
[3:06:01] <Renkage> So Pat's champions seem to be scumbags? I think he would like Shaco

[3:06:05] <pectusumbra> so now do that but making them run all over the map before they die
[3:06:08] <%SoFarFetched> should be fine now for discord

[3:06:27] <+InEzrealwetrust> oh man cloud soul really good for scummin
[3:06:27] <%ThatOneGameTester> You're actually really strong and most people will die in 5 auto attacks and a Q
[3:06:30] <ha2ken> Yo it's Pat Stares At League Part 2.
[3:06:31] <+Grayhammatter> just wiggling
[3:06:34] <%ledgefiendd> They're too scared to approach alone now Pat
[3:06:35] <+BringBackSempai> this is why I only play junkrat in overwatch, so I can watch people try to rush through the front line just to take me out
[3:06:36] <%Agami23> pat, now you understand how that dhalsim player feels when you play zangief
[3:06:36] <+DarkShadow124> @suikudo Naw

[3:06:43] <+Jekado> he needs to ward jungle
[3:06:44] <%KevinsLunchbox> put mushrooms on their jungle paths
[3:06:47] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat space out your shrroms if you're trying to bait an attack, their dmg doesn't stack
[3:06:50] <+Linearlinera> the split push PogChamp
[3:06:52] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat remember if you stand still you go invisible
[3:06:54] <%KevinsLunchbox> put mushrooms on their jungle paths pat
[3:06:54] <%SoFarFetched> @BringBackSempai junkrat is hilarious to play on OW cause people get salty about him LUL
[3:06:55] <Narukamiiii> Pat's taunting ability is questionable
[3:06:55] <sidstyler> Teemo is inevitable
[3:06:58] <vingadivo> pat shrooms are visible when you plant them
[3:07:04] <mankeyfigh> Mid
[3:07:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> His team basically won without him LUL
[3:07:08] <tr00ly_> learn to last hit jeez
[3:07:09] <VritraReiRei> @ha2ken its actually Part 3
[3:07:10] <ha2ken> Pat's a Teemo....he's a teem player
[3:07:10] <%ThatOneGameTester> Turrets have "true sight" which grants vision of stealth units, like your mushrooms
[3:07:11] <%KevinsLunchbox> put the mushrooms on their jungle paths
[3:07:13] <korth367> gotta space em out a bit

[3:07:42] <vingadivo> pat what you're doing is split pushing
[3:07:42] <NiktenKing> His ult is for warding, scouting, and making people rage
[3:07:43] <%galaxyswirl> yep, both singed and teemo are spit push champs @AngriestPat meaning they push a lane solo
[3:07:43] <damienlunas> I've been watching the stream for 5 minutes and I almost started being toxic by being like "Way to help the teamfight Pat". League toxicity is too powerful.
[3:07:46] <BlackermanZX> Surrender incoming

[3:08:16] <+Linearlinera> he wants to destroy them
[3:08:20] <ape_hawk> fuckin morg
[3:08:20] <%SoFarFetched> @BringBackSempai What's more hilarious is when you put the trap at the same exact spot and the ot her team keeps falling for it. Had one match where a guy fell for the same one 5 times.
[3:08:20] <+Blucarot> @angriestpat You can make his Shrooms bounce on each other

[3:14:52] <Renkage> You have a stroke?
[3:14:52] <GZSteelers > no smite
[3:14:56] <%CalderGaming> it's "play whichever one has the most of your friends already playing"
[3:14:59] <%ArcanumMBD> Play Smite if you want your game to have garbage balance and be abandoned in the near future
[3:15:05] <LoneFonte> @AngriestPat play HOTS even now that it is slowly dying?
[3:15:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> I played HoTS for a minute

[3:15:47] <Renkage> You wanted that scene in Marvels Spider Man, with the sea of poison
[3:15:48] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:15:49] <%CalderGaming> they've been working on fighting the toxic for the better part of 10 years
[3:15:49] <+DarkShadow124> Bot lane but ok
[3:15:50] <shabop> its cuz they got robots banning the most toxic
[3:15:50] <artificiallynatural> TURN IT ON
[3:15:51] <%rj1771> If you want Toxic you need to go into Ranked
[3:15:53] <%Birdigalore> RENEK-TRON

[3:15:56] <%Deano8817> let us see the salt PunOko
[3:15:59] <+D00msDayDan> i bet all the toxicity has been on stream and you haven't been seeing it
[3:15:59] <ChrisM341> I want a Bingo Card of insults that Pat may encounter in ranked
[3:16:00] <vingadivo> pat check out nasus hes cheap and plays like immobile champs like garen
[3:16:00] <illTemperedSeaBass> It's not fair that Smite's still around and Paragon went under.
[3:16:03] <ButterMyBrisket> ranked people are super toxic when they're losing LUL
[3:16:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> TURN IT ON
[3:16:06] <%TG_Cid11> Hey Pat there is a hero in Dota 2 that can place mines at level 1 and suicide himself
[3:16:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> Paragon deserved better.
[3:16:10] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat some people actually got perma banned from in game chat.
[3:16:10] <Kiari13> yeah :) congrats pat
[3:16:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHAT DROPPING N BOMBS
[3:16:12] <+0range_> you dont want heated gamer moments?
[3:16:12] <+2DSuperiority> @AngriestPat cover chat with your bodymass?
[3:16:12] <$Chimeraelite> Yep you did
[3:16:12] <+Grayhammatter> i think so
[3:16:16] <+Jekado> I think you got the jist
[3:16:16] <Zelretch3000> turn it on, lots of league streamer got it on
[3:16:16] <%galaxyswirl> YES YOU DID
[3:16:18] <%mostundesired> A little
[3:16:19] <artificiallynatural> you became the scum of the earth
[3:16:19] <pectusumbra> You took a good first step for sure
[3:16:20] <+FrenchTact1cs> kinda
[3:16:23] <Imsoverylazy> @VektorTroika He really can't. Riven's Shield makes her suvivability bullshit. She has better mobility, damage and CC, and her ultimate does the same as his plus a ranged execute
[3:16:23] <%Piemen99> i guess
[3:16:23] <Narukamiiii> The more you understand the game the more toxic you become, you need to rise above the hate, or join the dark side
[3:16:24] <%aster_d> teemo is about being a little shit
[3:16:25] <1matheuw> paraggon seemed fun
[3:16:25] <%freezydude> hey pat check out nasus
[3:16:26] <%Agami23> once you started understanding the mines it seemed to click really well with you
[3:16:26] <T_Sasquatch> @illtemperedseabass brudda
[3:16:26] <Murphio_GS> haha teemo lol
[3:16:26] <%moogleboy1984> Morde is hard to fight in top
[3:16:27] <nobknee> Play that tiny mummy.
[3:16:28] <NiktenKing> You got like 80 percent of what Teemo do
[3:16:28] <pectusumbra> most of it after that is learning to be more annoying
[3:16:28] <%Piemen99> i dont know
[3:16:30] <+Pendragwn> @CalderGaming if they get aggressive with combating toxic players will just use it to be more toxic
[3:16:31] <+Jekado> the shroom placement needs to be more diverse
[3:16:31] <hntronium> Chat here dropping the hard teemo r
[3:16:32] <%Sephirios> Teemo is Satan for a reason
[3:16:32] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat Toxicity only really comes out when people start typing. You don't type and toxicity will stay low
[3:16:32] <mankeyfigh> Sure
[3:16:33] <vingadivo> check out nasus pat i think you'll like it
[3:16:34] <93lobo> Leona Tank Support is basically Paige in Mustard Armor and Praises the sun
[3:16:35] <%galaxyswirl> just need to be a bigger shit with shroomds
[3:16:36] <+Grayhammatter> baiting those people in the river was good
[3:16:36] <%Birdigalore> So when is Pat gonna start playing OSU between games?! lol
[3:16:37] <hntronium> YoRdle
[3:16:40] <BlackermanZX> Amumu players have big balls
[3:16:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> Paragon WAS fun. Then they kept reowrking how the actual fucking Game worked
[3:16:44] <1matheuw> ttoo bad the developer kiled it
[3:16:45] <Blank9> top is the least toxic role
[3:16:46] <+Jekado> you need to shroom your jungle backlanes to prevent ganking
[3:16:46] <+FlubbedPig> Is Braum still good? When I played I played him, and he was cool.
[3:16:52] <Klefth> Check out Nasus and make big number go big
[3:16:53] <Blank9> play any other and you'll get tons of it
[3:16:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> DansGame
[3:16:57] <Kiari13> me :)
[3:16:57] <+darquezsmith> try jinx BloodTrail
[3:16:58] <+arancet> braum is still the same
[3:16:58] <+babrukus> you.......did it
[3:16:59] <+Jekado> if you shroom enough the enemies end up never followning out of fear
[3:17:01] <%Swampykins> wat
[3:17:03] <nobknee> me :)
[3:17:04] <1matheuw> ban yasuo
[3:17:04] <hntronium> Ban your teemo
[3:17:09] <%galaxyswirl> @FlubbedPig everyone is good, just some people are better
[3:17:13] <Imsoverylazy> Ban Senna
[3:17:15] <Kongro_> Is Pat gonna stream the State of Play thing or just the TGA?
[3:17:17] <%maskofmichael> Ban Everyone but me
[3:17:20] <+Jekado> i've had enemies disengage when i go in lanes with no shrroms because they just weren't sure
[3:17:20] <%freezydude> @Blank9 hell no toxic is one of the most toxic roles, it's always "CAMP MY LANE JUNGLER" and it attacts players like hashinshin lol
[3:17:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ban Every Character
[3:17:23] <dalollypop> @AngriestPat How long have you been playing league
[3:17:27] <+Jontman42> @AngriestPat It would probably be a good idea to at some point take some time just to practice last hitting and moving between auto-attacks, those two skills alone make a massive difference when learning
[3:17:31] <BaronVonProlix> BAN PAIGE
[3:17:31] <nauticalgypsy> the ranked salt is the best especially if you couldn't care less about winning
[3:17:33] <vilelee> hey is Heroes of Newearth still a thing
[3:17:33] <+chase959> I love senna
[3:17:33] <%moogleboy1984> Senna has too many passives
[3:17:36] <lokiluko> I stopped playing shortly after rengar came out, apparently that was in 2012
[3:17:36] <vingadivo> Jax is this purple dude thats is so stronk that he beats up people with a shitty lamp post you should try and check him out
[3:17:38] <%Agami23> @Kongro_ pats not streaming either, but paige is streaming game awards
[3:17:41] <Renkage> Thresh is fun

[3:24:05] <T_Sasquatch> Wait , did pat buy all the league characters ??
[3:24:06] <gloppie> Tarkov is buggy and frustrating, but amazing and rewarding
[3:24:07] <%rj1771> Pat, do you know what Leashing is? It's where you help your JG get some hits on the monster they're starting on so they can kill it faster and lose less life in the process.

[3:31:46] <%SilentEric> He used Singed
[3:31:47] <%nmaten> you click on them

[3:32:05] <%Gogogolem> oh a xayah
[3:32:08] <%SashaStarshine> LoL is basically just competitive "get number big"
[3:32:08] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat, i need you to zoom in on your nose for me.

[3:33:05] <%SilentEric> Teemo is in the card game.
[3:33:05] <+FlubbedPig> How would Singed even work in a fighting game?
[3:33:05] <+Bricespresso> only low hit like yoda in soul cal
[3:33:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Tyler1

[3:33:26] <darkmind95> I CAN SEE IT NOW! HE IS TEKKEN 3 GON!
[3:33:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Give Teemo a flashkick you cowards
[3:33:33] <%absolutely_naught> pat don't use your ability on the monster to help, just auto attack it
[3:33:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Teemo would be peacock
[3:33:36] <%ledgefiendd> Teemo but he's acutally a HAM af vortex monster
[3:33:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> UWU
[3:33:37] <pectusumbra> Now pat, this time hang around a moment after that monster dies for a free soul

[3:38:51] <%XxBTExX> ignite
[3:38:53] <1matheuw> perfect execution
[3:38:54] <NiktenKing> Worth
[3:38:55] <%blastazoid26> POGGERS
[3:38:55] <VritraReiRei> Lantern would have saved you

[3:38:56] <%ItsSansom> W yourself for a shield
[3:39:01] <KingGrimlock1> okay pat, you've got 2 more deaths to make up for
[3:39:01] <TwistedVerse> lantern
[3:39:03] <BlackermanZX> dont forget the lantern
[3:39:04] <+jiggy_snipe> your lantern is a shield
[3:39:04] <+Jekado> his adc doesn't seem to be doing well
[3:39:05] <TwistedVerse> shield
[3:39:05] <MyNameIsRasus> W gives you a shield
[3:39:06] <vingadivo> pat you'll want to use E first before Q it makes it easier to land
[3:39:06] <+Shoosler> sbfpRage did someone say sbfpRage Rage sbfpRage in chat??? sbfpRage
[3:39:08] <%NSwarmlord> Where's the Boivin
[3:39:09] <zamzoph> Pat is inting
[3:39:10] <+jiggy_snipe> also use your biscuits
[3:39:14] <vingadivo> W gives you shield pat
[3:39:17] <%Sephirios> dont forgett yiou have cookies for healing

[3:39:19] <+Jekado> what does lantern do again it does like a zoning thing right?
[3:39:23] <TwistedVerse> eat your triscuits pat
[3:39:26] <%SilentEric> Teemo is also in the card game and is just as annoying as a card.
[3:39:27] <%rj1771> W grants a shield, if an ally clicks the lantern the dash straight to you. It's a shield and a save.
[3:39:30] <flyingtentaclemonster> good ahit
[3:39:30] <+LoganWulfric> Use your biscuit if you're going to engage too, having ticking hp gains is big important early
[3:39:32] <Narukamiiii> I wonder what Pat's sith name is gonna be when he eventually give in to the toxicity

[3:39:51] <waterstealer> @AngriestPat pat if you throw ur w at the soul you collect it without having to walk over it
[3:39:57] <%ItsSansom> @Jekado Lantern gives a shield to thresh and one other ally. Also, allies that touch the lantern will get pulled to Thresh

[3:40:02] <+arancet> @Narukamiiii Darth Ragemo
[3:40:04] <%moogleboy1984> @Quigsies Inting is initiating. Basically, you wait for them to whiff a skill and then go in on them

[3:43:44] <Rhinoprotoss> Pat is starting to feel it
[3:43:44] <Tennochief> remember to use Ignite, it helps out a lot
[3:43:45] <studleydoorite> this doesn't look good for our heroes
[3:43:48] <CptCreampuff16> why is pat playing support doesnt he know only girl gamers play support
[3:43:48] <%damienlunas> apatPat apatPat apatPat
[3:43:48] <vingadivo> pat keeps forgetting ignite
[3:43:49] <%mostundesired> This is just sad
[3:43:51] <+Pendragwn> are doth feeling it now mr pat
[3:43:52] <Wakerpl> that xayah is so thrash, it's actually impressive
[3:43:52] <+Jekado> he seems to be doing a lot of damage
[3:43:53] <Tennochief> a lot
[3:43:54] <%ItsSansom> Like 200
[3:43:57] <Manwad> mouse over it
[3:43:58] <%Gogogolem> scales with level
[3:43:59] <CapCasual> My eyes are bleeding. DansGame
[3:43:59] <TwistedVerse> is ignite a one use spell or what?
[3:43:59] <%arcaderabbit48> See, I'm actually getting tilted now because I'm a Support main. I've been here before. And it fucking sucks'
[3:43:59] <Jarvanii> just play teemo LUL
[3:44:00] <Hellarussian> like 10%
[3:44:00] <KingGrimlock1> It scales
[3:44:00] <%QuadraticGravity> It's like 10-20%
[3:44:00] <+chase959> read it
[3:44:01] <waterstealer> it shows you
[3:44:02] <BlackermanZX> A lot
[3:44:02] <+TruSquad> hover over it
[3:44:03] <Tennochief> it's good for last hits
[3:44:04] <shabop> mouse over it and it will tell you
[3:44:04] <%ledgefiendd> early game its like a quarter of the bar
[3:44:04] <waterstealer> hover over it
[3:44:05] <%SashaStarshine> 200, it also halves all heals on them
[3:44:05] <awesomeguy423> what do girl(male) gamers play
[3:44:06] <Blank9> use it early soyou can use it more
[3:44:06] <pochiyeah> F reduces healing aswell
[3:44:07] <%Blucarot> SCales and stops helaing
[3:44:08] <ha2ken> Use when low
[3:44:08] <stoccton> he can't read it LUL
[3:44:08] <+Jekado> it prevents heals i think too
[3:44:09] <+jiggy_snipe> hover of it
[3:44:10] <vingadivo> it kills on low health
[3:44:10] <KingGrimlock1> but it's true damage and cuts healing by a lot
[3:44:11] <waterstealer> it shows you the exact number
[3:44:11] <%ledgefiendd> Its a waste to not use it
[3:44:12] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat as a learning tip, it'
[3:44:12] <+jiggy_snipe> it'll tell you
[3:44:12] <Tennochief> no, it's used for securing kills
[3:44:13] <nolzee> alittle, but it prevents healing items
[3:44:13] <KingGrimlock1> so it's really good early game
[3:44:14] <TwistedVerse> READ IT
[3:44:14] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat it's like 10-15%
[3:44:15] <Rhinoprotoss> estimate 1/10th
[3:44:16] <shiny_prinny> Ignite lowers their healing too
[3:44:16] <93lobo> Stops healing and scales with level
[3:44:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> ahri was typing in all chat. the way she paused right there. she's fucking malding bro
[3:44:18] <+Jekado> he can't read it remember
[3:44:19] <%XxBTExX> its a 3 minute cooldown... better to use it than not to
[3:44:20] <waterstealer> read it you fuck
[3:44:21] <%SashaStarshine> If you're in a fight use it
[3:44:21] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat ignite stops healing too pat its useful for more than damage
[3:44:21] <%SilentEric> It stops healing. Its always useful
[3:44:22] <+Jekado> not on his tv
[3:44:22] <Narukamiiii> Ignite is true damage, it ignores defenses @AngriestPat
[3:44:22] <vingadivo> Always use on low health enemies always
[3:44:22] <%XxBTExX> it also reduces any healing
[3:44:23] <+kiha38> you should have used it earlier
[3:44:23] <mrlastchance1> tell xayah to fucking farm christ
[3:44:24] <+Pendragwn> to suffer
[3:44:24] <%Sephirios> 10-20% but also reduces their lifesteal by 50%
[3:44:24] <bursky00> It's mostly used to counter heal
[3:44:27] <simulationbard> It's good for conforming kills and it reduces healing
[3:44:27] <%Nobrev> damage is damage
[3:44:27] <Tennochief> you use it at low health, and they're as good as dead
[3:44:27] <KingGrimlock1> FUCK THAT CRAB UP
[3:44:28] <TwistedVerse> just to suffer
[3:44:28] <%Blucarot> @AngriestPat It also stops any healing
[3:44:29] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[3:44:29] <%ItsSansom> Don't worry about wasting it, it's a bit of extra damage on a couple minute cd
[3:44:30] <%SashaStarshine> If you save cooldowns while the enemy dont you lose
[3:44:31] <MyNameIsRasus> 10%ish
[3:44:33] <+VektorTroika> It also cuts healing on the target
[3:44:35] <+Centauren> @AngriestPat You want to use it to cut the effect of their heal. It doesn't have a long enough CD to justify holding it forever
[3:44:39] <%Blucarot> omg
[3:44:40] <TwistedVerse> LOL
[3:44:41] <KingGrimlock1> RIP

[3:45:22] <%SashaStarshine> If they have a ward there they can
[3:45:23] <%ItsSansom> Must have been warded
[3:45:23] <shabop> if there is a wartd yes
[3:45:23] <VritraReiRei> it was probably warded
[3:45:24] <%Blucarot> Maybe there was a ward there
[3:45:25] <Wakerpl> no, unless it's warded
[3:45:25] <pochiyeah> warded or just game sense

[3:45:25] <koolaid_kevster> you just have to be safer
[3:45:25] <TwistedVerse> warded af
[3:45:26] <BigHugs> If it's warded yes
[3:45:26] <Rhinoprotoss> Town portal?
[3:45:26] <Renkage> No. But there was probably a ward
[3:45:26] <%Blucarot> Ward
[3:45:26] <%ButterMyBrisket> you were warded parobably
[3:45:26] <1matheuw> that bush was warded
[3:45:26] <Hegataro> Nah, they probably saw you walk in, though
[3:45:26] <+Jontman42> Nope, it was probably warded though
[3:45:27] <Hellarussian> ward
[3:45:27] <koolaid_kevster> wards
[3:45:27] <simulationbard> He guessed
[3:45:27] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Only if the bush si Warded
[3:45:27] <pectusumbra> ward
[3:45:27] <+Centauren> @AngriestPat wards
[3:45:28] <+Jekado> WARDED
[3:45:28] <+jiggy_snipe> it was probably warded or he guessed
[3:45:28] <BlackermanZX> Ward
[3:45:28] <+Pendragwn> They can see you if they're in there too, or have a ward
[3:45:28] <Kiari13> LUL
[3:45:29] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat lucky guess, or ward
[3:45:29] <waterstealer> HE SAW YOU WALK INTO IT
[3:45:30] <%TheWinged7> gues
[3:45:30] <lbrownthedestroyer> warded
[3:45:31] <%rj1771> And that bush usually has a ward in it
[3:45:31] <mrlastchance1> oof that 14 to 5 before level 6
[3:45:33] <sirscumbag13> Saw you go into the bush or the bush was warded
[3:45:34] <RadShiro> a ward or guess
[3:45:34] <%Sephirios> or they see you go in to the busg
[3:45:34] <pectusumbra> or if they just saw you
[3:45:35] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat as a learning tip, just use Ignite anyways, so that you get used to how much damage it does at certain levels. you will get a feel for it eventually
[3:45:35] <KingGrimlock1> that or he SAW YOU WALK INTO IT
[3:45:35] <%Rngiddion> thats common ward bush
[3:45:36] <%Blucarot> Pat step up your ward game
[3:45:38] <%LaughingCatt> aeroOOF aeroOOF aeroOOF
[3:45:39] <+Thisigia> That's a pretty common ward spot
[3:45:39] <93lobo> They have wards
[3:45:40] <%moogleboy1984> people have object permanence
[3:45:40] <zayasu> pat did you try blitzcrank? :)
[3:45:42] <NiktenKing> Either warded and it's a common spot if teamfights happen
[3:45:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> They had a ward in there, and enemy wards are invisible in most situations
[3:45:46] <NiktenKing> Never face check a bush
[3:45:46] <ralphfromdk> It's a "safe" place to do it, so people will check, or maybe they have wards
[3:45:47] <%ledgefiendd> Sometimes, people also just guess
[3:45:48] <pectusumbra> it's really common to ward river bushes so you don't get killed
[3:45:50] <+VektorTroika> cuz thrash dummy thicc
[3:45:52] <T_Sasquatch> Does pat know he can just look forward and right click to one spot from base
[3:45:52] <%xvalltendo> BibleThump BibleThump
[3:45:52] <%ItsSansom> Always be xtra safe with where you're recalling
[3:45:59] <%QuadraticGravity> Pat you should max E and build raw damage cause this Xayah ain't doing shit tbh
[3:46:11] <+BishopBain> Pat you know what you really need to get into? Dota 2. Kappa
[3:46:11] <BigHugs> Stop wasting W early

[3:48:19] <waterstealer> type /ff
[3:48:27] <%TweetHeart> friendship with Xayah, ended. Jax is new best friend.
[3:48:28] <%ButterMyBrisket> @studleydoorite they mean support the jungler
[3:48:31] <BaronVonProlix> Xaynoh
[3:48:33] <%LaughingCatt> His hook is damn hard to use
[3:48:33] <%Blucarot> Wtf jax
[3:48:36] <zayasu> he really wanted that lantern LUL
[3:48:36] <KingGrimlock1> pat just needs to play a simpler support than thresh next time
[3:48:38] <+jiggy_snipe> gotta land a hook
[3:48:40] <TwistedVerse> slap his ass pat, whip him
[3:48:44] <%ledgefiendd> @AngriestPat if you can flay first, hook is easy af
[3:48:46] <ha2ken> Tbh Blitz is a little easier
[3:48:48] <TwistedVerse> there we go
[3:48:49] <stoccton> O SHIT
[3:48:50] <%Blucarot> Nah i think jax could have just jumped that
[3:48:51] <KingGrimlock1> TIME TO ENTER THE YI ZONE
[3:48:54] <%Blucarot> ignite
[3:48:55] <+Jekado> what the hell did they add that bit to the map? that U turn in the corner
[3:48:58] <phrickshun> as a side note, as a support you should consider getting a sweeping lens trinket to find wards (you keep getting screwed by enemy wards)
[3:49:02] <+Jekado> they are too fed
[3:49:02] <+doe3879> F you bitch
[3:49:03] <BaronVonProlix> NOOO ONE CLICKS MY LAMP
[3:49:04] <T_Sasquatch> Yeyeyeye
[3:49:04] <BlackermanZX> Dont forget ult
[3:49:05] <Manwad> happens.
[3:49:06] <waterstealer> MORE TOXIC
[3:49:08] <darkmind95> He couldn't
[3:49:09] <ThirdPersonPhil> wtf you talking about?
[3:49:09] <@BigNaturalMan59> pat what are your thoughts on LSU stomping Georgia for the SEC championship?
[3:49:10] <nolzee> get used to it
[3:49:11] <shiny_prinny> you put it on the wrong side of him
[3:49:11] <%ItsSansom> Don't think he could click it
[3:49:13] <%SashaStarshine> That's the Thresh experience
[3:49:13] <Tennochief> he couldn't
[3:49:13] <+theman515> throw it a little bit ahead of where he's going
[3:49:14] <%ledgefiendd> very common
[3:49:16] <+jay521> so toxic LUL
[3:49:16] <%xvalltendo> yeah
[3:49:17] <%arcaderabbit48> "Click the Lantern" is a meme for a reason
[3:49:17] <Rhinoprotoss> He literally couldn't
[3:49:17] <+CarlosEoM> you're getting it
[3:49:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat when you go back get a sweeper
[3:49:17] <+theman515> give time for lag
[3:49:22] <+Centauren> @AngriestPat its very hard to click the lantern when you throw it on top of someone. You want to throw it to where they can run
[3:49:22] <NiktenKing> It happens... to be fair. Yi would murder in like a second if he walked towards it
[3:49:27] <%rj1771> Welcome to LoL Pat: your team will ALWAYS be bad. pooSwag
[3:49:29] <zenith0111> Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited
[3:49:32] <darkmind95> And so was Yi
[3:49:32] <TwistedVerse> the lantern was up his bum
[3:49:32] <%Evil_John_Cena> @Jekado most recent patch or two they added it in
[3:49:38] <+Centauren> @AngriestPat The usual advice is to throw it like a football
[3:49:39] <%Blucarot> soggyChamp
[3:49:39] <+mickers> if u press q again after hooking someone it makes u dash to them
[3:49:39] <+Jekado> true LoL experince
[3:49:40] <%ItsSansom> If there's a minion/champion/ward on the lantern, they can't actually select it
[3:49:45] <Renkage> You would be supprised how many people don't use the lantern. Especially at your level right now. They might just not know
[3:49:46] <%MelBrooksKA> The other on top of him
[3:49:55] <%rj1771> Now you see where the toxicity comes from.

[3:52:09] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat If you want to play support, you might consider playing an "Aggressive Support", a support that can carry in case your ADC is garbo. Brand, Vel'Koz, Zyra, etc.

[3:54:06] <+Grayhammatter> that was not helpful in the least, but good try
[3:54:06] <%Blucarot> @AngriestPat Dont feel bad about this game they are probably smurfs
[3:54:11] <T_Sasquatch> I really don't see how mobas are popular for the casual player
[3:54:18] <darkmind95> The Botlane was not very good this game
[3:54:20] <KingGrimlock1> it's all the stuff to learn
[3:54:22] <KingGrimlock1> okay uh
[3:54:23] <lordzarcon_> jax carry Pogchamp

[3:54:37] <alephalpha> you play with your friends
[3:54:38] <+Jekado> is anyone on pats team doing well?
[3:54:39] <%Blucarot> @AngriestPat See if youre playing this game you always have to get an excuse to make yourself feel better that is the way

[3:54:47] <%ItsSansom> Yeah you're getting your shit stomped because they're smurfs. You're actually playing alright for your level
[3:54:50] <+Jekado> but that birdperson is doing bad
[3:54:52] <+Jontman42> You might win if you just group and hope Jax kills everyone
[3:54:56] <%ThatOneGameTester> mmm Bonded Kappa

[3:55:14] <+Pendragwn> Baiting in the enemy team?
[3:55:14] <pectusumbra> so it looks like your goal is to make the game go as long as possible
[3:55:16] <%Blucarot> Everyone is team playing while irelia is playing singleplayer lol
[3:55:18] <+Audega> You're too low
[3:55:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat My bad. Couldn't see under the new red/blue buff. Thought you had it on someone else.

[4:01:21] <%TweetHeart> Jax was a hero
[4:01:23] <%freezydude> JUNGLE
[4:01:26] <Renkage> Shoulda given it to Jax. He had 90% of your team's kills
[4:01:26] <%xvalltendo> you did it!
[4:01:28] <%Deano8817> mid is just top but with twice the ganking
[4:01:29] <TwistedVerse> he clicked the best waifu, thats all
[4:01:30] <%ItsSansom> Does he know about smart cast?
[4:01:32] <beanfriction> Has Pat played mid today?
[4:01:32] <KingGrimlock1> AATROX TIME
[4:01:34] <cherrycottontail> I recommend picking 1 role and sticking to it until you learn the game
[4:01:35] <+CaptainJax> AP Blitzcrank mid
[4:01:36] <BaronVonProlix> that went ok
[4:01:36] <pectusumbra> welcome to the support mines
[4:01:37] <%nochanceinhell_27> Thats how league works
[4:01:37] <friendlyjoker312> Pat. you have enough to buy a new champ, why arent you?
[4:01:37] <vingadivo> try nasus pat hes a toplaner
[4:01:38] <%NSwarmlord> Wanna try out Talon?
[4:01:38] <mrlastchance1> Use ignite more
[4:01:39] <%ButterMyBrisket> tbh you were doing fine i think. the skill between the teams were a bit too far
[4:01:39] <+Jekado> support games are almost always rough
[4:01:40] <KarakuriBro> Smite is the poor man console leage dawge kappa
[4:01:41] <1matheuw> that xayah deserves jail time for that game
[4:01:45] <vingadivo> try nasus
[4:01:47] <BlackermanZX> Thats why you go support with a friend
[4:01:47] <+jiggy_snipe> yea play top until you learn the game
[4:01:53] <%bevyrage> support goes generally smoother when you can actually communicate with your lane partner
[4:01:54] <wafflegear> the jax was good
[4:01:54] <pectusumbra> @friendlyjoker312 try them frist
[4:01:58] <beanfriction> Buy Tahm Kench
[4:02:00] <+korean_random> support is hard if your AD is trolling
[4:02:01] <vingadivo> try nasus or jax
[4:02:02] <Damie904> Hey Pat, I know he's prob not your taste but any interest in Heimerdinger?
[4:02:03] <korth367> play more singed
[4:02:04] <+Grayhammatter> but teemo though
[4:02:04] <nolzee> get pyke
[4:02:05] <%XxBTExX> he needs to test the waters wit hthe champs before he blind buys
[4:02:07] <+arancet> eww not kench
[4:02:07] <vingadivo> nasus pat
[4:02:08] <shiny_prinny> If braum becomes free, you might want to try him support
[4:02:13] <friendlyjoker312> Try using the real cheap ones, they cost only 450
[4:02:14] <ha2ken> Don't buy too many champs when you're still learning
[4:02:15] <T_Sasquatch> Smite is actually a 2d moba with a 3rd person camera so it's kinda awful
[4:02:17] <+VektorTroika> if you SAVE your currency, you get a BIGGER NUMBER

[4:13:04] <r90thunder> Rock solid
[4:13:04] <+Jekado> he doesn't have ignite
[4:13:04] <mrlastchance1> Someone needs to teach him how to use flash to get kills
[4:13:04] <Blank9> oh he doesn't have it now
[4:13:05] <Renkage> He doesn't have ignite
[4:13:06] <%Gogogolem> breaking those makes her weaker

[4:13:29] <VritraReiRei> @Jekado you mean Teleport?
[4:13:30] <%SashaStarshine> Mana management is really important on Malphite, he's got some MASSIVE mana costs
[4:13:34] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Watch out for those wall tentacles, she has an attack that causes all nearby tentacles to slap at you.
[4:13:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat get back your out of mana
[4:13:43] <+DinnerCalzone> She heals when her tentacles slap you
[4:13:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @A0N33 you mean the tentacles?
[4:13:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> laning without range isn't terribly fun without a good matchup

[4:19:39] <%Sephirios> She rips your soul out and a % of damage done to it is transfered to you
[4:19:39] <Renkage> THAT was her ultimate
[4:19:40] <darkmind95> Now THAT is her ult
[4:19:40] <MoonlightP> don't fight illaoi on her own terms
[4:19:40] <pectusumbra> you want to stay out of her kill box
[4:19:41] <mrlastchance1> Oh her ult is more tentacles
[4:19:42] <+BIumen> use ult to escape
[4:19:43] <Tempmael> dodge it
[4:19:44] <OldManDeckardCain> PJSalt
[4:19:44] <Rotharn> She used her ult
[4:19:45] <ristos237> the jump was her ult
[4:19:46] <%crazyspartan214> she took your soul'
[4:19:47] <%rj1771> @KingGrimlock1 Yeah, I was trying to explain her ult then went into explaining her E xP
[4:19:47] <%Sephirios> that was the ulti
[4:19:48] <vingadivo> that was her ult
[4:19:48] <%wujak> when she hits that clone of you it hurts you too
[4:19:48] <+0range_> her ult
[4:19:50] <MyNameIsRasus> that's her ult
[4:19:51] <bursky00> She used her ult to summon a ton of tentacles
[4:19:51] <%Verd_254> you can use your ult to escape
[4:19:55] <shinji_ifrit> jesus plague LUL
[4:19:57] <MyNameIsRasus> R
[4:19:58] <+xddddsorandom> Look at what her abilities do
[4:19:58] <+GodDougle> you have to hit and run with her
[4:19:59] <%bevyrage> so pat, whenever she hits your clone she damages you. if both you and the clone take a hit from an AoE then your damage is doubled because of it.
[4:19:59] <vingadivo> her ult spawns tentacles
[4:19:59] <friendlyjoker312> her ult creates a tentacle for each enemy she hits, your ghost also counts as an enemy
[4:20:02] <%NSwarmlord> You'll have to check later
[4:20:02] <%Fenrirlives> Illaoi best girl with great taste in men!
[4:20:03] <MoonlightP> she's like a trap character in a fighting game, she has her space on the stage
[4:20:04] <Rotharn> Her ult summons tentacles you can't attack, every time she hits you they slap you
[4:20:04] <gloppie> @AngriestPat Her ult does a bunch of instant damage and spawns more tentacles
[4:20:05] <%Agami23> her ult spawned a buncha tentacles and slapped you and your soul
[4:20:06] <MoonlightP> don't violate that space
[4:20:07] <%furiousfurioso> @AngriestPat she pulled out your soul, and then hit your soul AND you with tentacles, doing tons of bonus damage
[4:20:09] <MoonlightP> force her out
[4:20:10] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat she has a skill that creates a ghost version of you, she can deal damage to it and you take a percentage of the damage dealt. Her Ult: she slams the ground and all tentacles slam the ground too
[4:20:10] <+mickers> you should wiki the enemies abilities and read them before the start of each match
[4:20:11] <%RayDaug> Illaoi takes a bit of reading to understand
[4:20:12] <sirscumbag13> Her W triggers her tentacles
[4:20:13] <MoonlightP> and if she doesn't come out
[4:20:15] <TwinBat> Kappa
[4:20:15] <+meowmeow7t> She slams the ground creates more tentacles to focuse you
[4:20:16] <shockmaster3> use your ult to run away XD
[4:20:16] <branlomanche> she steal your soul and if she kills it or you go too far u start spawning tentacles that always attack you
[4:20:16] <korth367> lewd
[4:20:17] <ralphfromdk> Tentacles hit you and hurt you. Her ult makes a lot of them. That's it
[4:20:18] <Haarute> her ult is to summon a bunch of tentacles and beat you to death with them.
[4:20:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Illaoi's passive spawns tentacles along walls. Her Ult is a jump and then a pound. It spawns tentacles per champion hit.
[4:20:18] <MoonlightP> then you need to stay out
[4:20:19] <sirscumbag13> So that dunk causes her tentacles to slam down
[4:20:19] <+RenoDeGeneric> She's a big bully
[4:20:21] <vingadivo> ULT SPAWNS TENTACLES
[4:20:22] <+Ur3an> ult her
[4:20:24] <+Ur3an> kill her
[4:20:24] <mrlastchance1> Why is pat playing by himself? who okayed this?
[4:20:25] <+jiggy_snipe> her ult spawns 3 tentacles that immediately smack you and heal her
[4:20:26] <BlackermanZX> @AngriestPat Her ult does instant damage tentacles
[4:20:27] <+Caped_Eggy> Man pat is gonna love dota LUL
[4:20:27] <pectusumbra> ult
[4:20:27] <NiktenKing> It makes more sense if you play her
[4:20:29] <bursky00> All you need to think of is dodge the tentacles
[4:20:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> she's ready to push lane apparently
[4:20:31] <%Sephirios> Her E is a small "jump" attack, and when she does it all tentacles in range copys the attack
[4:20:33] <friendlyjoker312> She is really simple pat
[4:20:36] <RAH001> pat thats her stand. she beats on ur soul
[4:20:37] <+DinnerCalzone> LUL
[4:20:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> amazing
[4:20:40] <bursky00> it's like a raid boss mechanic

[4:20:45] <+PlagueOfGripes> truly amazing
[4:20:46] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Every time she uses W every tentacle within range slaps down on you
[4:20:46] <generalve> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE

[4:20:54] <KingGrimlock1> hey, so long as it works
[4:20:54] <+0range_> that jax was so squishy
[4:20:55] <MyNameIsRasus> You can use your R for escaping too!
[4:20:57] <Naphtali61> Everytime a tentacle hits you she gets life back
[4:21:00] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> @AngriestPat If she had ult, she would've killed you both.
[4:21:01] <%SashaStarshine> She becomes more dangerous the more people gang up on her
[4:21:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> old man jax can't jump like he used to
[4:21:04] <%Agami23> she is also strident bait because she is tall as shit and strong to match it.
[4:21:05] <generalve> pats so scared to look at chat LUL
[4:21:08] <darkmind95> Illaoi can 1v5 in the right circumstances
[4:21:09] <pectusumbra> she gets life back
[4:21:10] <shockmaster3> its basically hentai
[4:21:10] <Blank9> a good way to escape is move out of the way of tentacle
[4:21:10] <KingGrimlock1> SHE gets life back
[4:21:12] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Every tentacle slap - including her Q - heals her.
[4:21:12] <1matheuw> SHE
[4:21:13] <shiny_prinny> SHE gets life back
[4:21:13] <bursky00> Think of it as ffXIV monster attack mechanic you dodge the attack marker

[4:21:16] <vingadivo> SHE

[4:21:21] <Rotharn> Don't get hit
[4:21:22] <mrlastchance1> That talon is gonna be a problem
[4:21:22] <%Gogogolem> I'd suggest looking at her after game to understand her.

[4:21:28] <+Daniel_Is_I> You dodge and hit her
[4:21:29] <NiktenKing> Familiar/summoner champs are basically raid bosses
[4:21:29] <Haarute> don't get hit by tentacles.
[4:21:29] <CptCreampuff16> Pat shes a summoner/fighter she summons tentacles to beat you with

[4:21:31] <BlackermanZX> Thats the million dollar question
[4:21:31] <sirscumbag13> Short trades and dodge her abilities
[4:21:32] <KingGrimlock1> she literally tells you
[4:21:32] <Renkage> You gotta dodge her tentacle wacks.
[4:21:32] <friendlyjoker312> DONT GET HIT, Just keep moving, the tentacles are slow as shit
[4:21:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Range, crowd control. Teemo fucks her up
[4:21:33] <pectusumbra> you are fighting a grappler
[4:21:33] <KingGrimlock1> MOVE
[4:21:34] <vingadivo> DODGE
[4:21:34] <Maverick2736> BY GETTIN GUD
[4:21:35] <1matheuw> GITT GUDD
[4:21:36] <%Sephirios> Never fight her in a possition where she has multiple tentacles near by
[4:21:36] <%Blucarot> the tentacles have a wind up before hitting you
[4:21:36] <%Shadowthedigger> Maphite doesn't fight her that's how.
[4:21:36] <+tuchpi> actual boomer
[4:21:37] <%NSwarmlord> Poke with q and don't let her rip out your soul
[4:21:37] <+0range_> AVOID
[4:21:37] <+CaptainJax> Kill the tentacles, dont get hit
[4:21:37] <Blank9> walk left
[4:21:38] <+Jekado> i think you have to dodge it right?
[4:21:38] <%KevinsLunchbox> how do you read the one guy who says the wrong stupid shi
[4:21:39] <+xddddsorandom> DODGE
[4:21:40] <+Jekado> not tank it
[4:21:40] <%SashaStarshine> She literally shouts "MOVE" when she attacks you Pat
[4:21:42] <%galaxyswirl> kill /dodge the rape lines
[4:21:43] <%KevinsLunchbox> every fucking time
[4:21:43] <shockmaster3> she gets life back
[4:21:43] <ralphfromdk> If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a tentacle
[4:21:44] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat She's a lane bully, you have to keep killing the wall-tentacles to keep her bonus damage and healing down.
[4:21:44] <%Shadowthedigger> Just freeze the lane, wait for ganks.
[4:21:44] <%linSP> just dont get hit 4Head
[4:21:46] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> with a ranged champ?
[4:21:46] <+Glock3bb> @AngriestPat You're a tank. You're not supposed to.
[4:21:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Her tentacles don't attack you automatically. And they normally only spawn along walls.
[4:21:48] <+DeathGripsftGillesDeleuze> @Ghostfaceninja53534 it is more powerful than ever
[4:21:50] <NeonBleu> stay out of the hit box?
[4:21:52] <+Jontman42> You play the minigame of "dodge the tentacles"
[4:21:52] <Personified134> how is pat enjoying THE ROCK
[4:21:53] <gloppie> @AngriestPat Hide behind minions and poke with q
[4:21:53] <%TweetHeart> don't stand in the telegraphs is how. you played ff14, you know the deal
[4:21:56] <shockmaster3> dont get hit
[4:21:56] <+xddddsorandom> Don't try to smack her with your melee attack
[4:21:57] <awesomeguy423> pat: "wanna play plague?" plague: "no way KappaPride "
[4:21:57] <Rotharn> The tentacles can always be dodged if you move perpendicular to them, they have a long windup, her ULT's tentacles can't be dodged, they slap too fast
[4:21:58] <+xddddsorandom> you'll lose
[4:22:00] <cassiecagedd> She is the 1 on 1 Queen. you dont fight her without help basiclly.
[4:22:00] <MoonlightP> @AngriestPat when she grabs your soul out of your body and hits you, that does a percentage of damage to you as well. so if you and your soul are in the middle of a tentacle gangbang you're fucked. just stay out of where the tentacles are and don't get hit by the soul grab
[4:22:01] <+xddddsorandom> 100% of the time
[4:22:02] <pectusumbra> and yeah, big open areas are her weak spot
[4:22:04] <%RayDaug> You take Grasp instead of Comet and box like a man
[4:22:06] <%NSwarmlord> Basically like Darius where you don't wanna get into an extended melee

[4:22:11] <ape_hawk> talon starting to get fed
[4:22:12] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat think of those red line markers like the orange circles from FF14 rooSmug
[4:22:12] <Naphtali61> Q may give you enough move speed to dodge tentacles
[4:22:12] <+Caped_Eggy> How is it that pat has 2 kills out of 3 team kills LUL
[4:22:12] <lordzarcon_> oh thats not good
[4:22:14] <phrickshun> Pretend you're playing an MMO and don't stand in the red
[4:22:14] <branlomanche> buy armor and health
[4:22:15] <mrlastchance1> Christ that talon is gonna eat you alive
[4:22:17] <vigilantic> @angriestpat if you wanna see what the enemy can do without looking up it,when your dead you can left click the champ and hiver over the top left to see their passive/moves
[4:22:20] <+Daniel_Is_I> This game is gonna suck lol

[4:22:55] <BlackermanZX> Ulted too late
[4:22:57] <Personified134> Illaoi is fucking stupid
[4:22:57] <ape_hawk> yes
[4:22:57] <+BIumen> 3 man ult oof
[4:22:58] <+OneGorillionDollars> @AngriestPat Shaco, Only serial killers play him
[4:22:58] <+0range_> That was her ult
[4:22:59] <+Jekado> what does the ghost do again sorry i was distracted
[4:22:59] <pectusumbra> yes
[4:22:59] <NiktenKing> Yes
[4:22:59] <Haarute> ult first for cc
[4:23:00] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat you got Cthulu'd
[4:23:02] <Roach3s> BWAYHAHAHA\
[4:23:02] <+CaptainJax> the three tentacles is her ult, move out of that quickly
[4:23:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> She spawns tentacles with her ult. 1 for ever champion hhit
[4:23:03] <sirscumbag13> The BIG dunk is her ult yes
[4:23:03] <+HazukiGaming> Pat has the heart of a warrior
[4:23:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Ulted too late
[4:23:04] <vingadivo> pat ult her sooner pleaseeeee
[4:23:04] <KingGrimlock1> pat.
[4:23:05] <+PlagueOfGripes> Pat is feeding! Feeding!
[4:23:06] <cherrycottontail> You got hit by everything, should have ulted sooner
[4:23:07] <+gryffon95> spawns tentacles then slap
[4:23:07] <darkmind95> Jax didn't even ult, rip
[4:23:10] <Roach3s> this game sucks honestly
[4:23:10] <+korean_random> gang banged by tentacles
[4:23:11] <Rotharn> YES IT IS (he's learning :D)
[4:23:12] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat need to use ult after Jax stunned
[4:23:13] <+Jekado> it adds a target for lifesteal?
[4:23:14] <NiktenKing> One tentacle for every enemy champ enemy hit
[4:23:14] <+RenoDeGeneric> @AngriestPat She's a really bloated character and chat isn't going to be able to explain her well
[4:23:16] <1matheuw> reportt pat ffor intingg
[4:23:18] <vingadivo> you have to ult her before she ults you
[4:23:18] <shabop> if she hits you with e her tentacles constantly attack the double of you she makes
[4:23:19] <shiny_prinny> illaoi is complicated
[4:23:20] <+gryffon95> malphite isnt great top imo
[4:23:21] <KingGrimlock1> @AngriestPat Pat. Listen very carefully to me. When she ults, YOU WALK AWAY.
[4:23:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> She can pull a ghost out of you with a move that gets blocked by minions
[4:23:22] <darkmind95> Teleport time!
[4:23:23] <vigilantic> if you wanna see her ability/passive tou can left click a champ and see their skills at the top left
[4:23:23] <bursky00> U can use Malph's ult on the ground to run away
[4:23:24] <+Jontman42> A fed Illaoi can solo kill an entire team with her ult
[4:23:27] <shockmaster3> yes
[4:23:28] <MyNameIsRasus> You want to start teamfights with your ult, or use it for big cowardice
[4:23:30] <Naphtali61> The more enemies she catches in her ult, the move tentacles pop up, and each smash gives a lot of life back to her
[4:23:31] <+TheFakeBob> She's probably the least intuitive character to play against
[4:23:33] <Haarute> ULT FIRST. it's an initiation tool.
[4:23:34] <%arcaderabbit48> @Jekado Her tentacles automatically attack it, and any damage done to it is dealt as a % to you. So she can hit you twice as often
[4:23:34] <Naphtali61> Don't fight in it
[4:23:34] <BlackermanZX> Illaoi is fucking stu´pid
[4:23:37] <%SaintPyre> but pat what does your magical blitzgg cheatsheet tell you
[4:23:37] <Nefrette> Can someone please explain it to him hard
[4:23:39] <%bevyrage> so pat, you want to use your ult to initiate on a group of peeps, then use the slam and buff to combo in. from there just auto-attack and use Q to chase down squishies
[4:23:40] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Her ult spawns tentacles within an AoE around her for every champ in that AoE. Her W causes all tentacles to slap at the target of her W.
[4:23:41] <+Caped_Eggy> This is making me want to go back to LoL
[4:23:42] <vingadivo> WHEN SHE ULTS YOU HAVE TO RUN AWAY SHE CSNT KILL YOU IF YOU RUN
[4:23:45] <+PlagueOfGripes> Well, I'm sure the enemy team is statistically better than you now, due to having more investment. Tab and check their gear when you see them
[4:23:46] <%Glock3bb> Yay, 10 months! Glad to see you enjoying League!
[4:23:47] <shiny_prinny> if she's ever free, play her to learn what she does
[4:23:49] <+Trair> Her ultimate is a death pit you need to walk out of otherwise ur gonna get tentacled
[4:23:49] <pectusumbra> Yeah this game you're going to need to change your usual play. You'll want to go to other places to use your ul
[4:23:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Illaoi feeds on people to try to face her up
[4:23:52] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat think of her tentacles as a thunderdome, you dont want to be near them
[4:23:53] <friendlyjoker312> She is a champion that can kill you if you chose to fight her, but she cant really start a fight on her own
[4:23:56] <+Trair> Read her abilities on blitz if ur still using it
[4:23:58] <%Sephirios> explaining Illaoi in quick text is hardf
[4:23:59] <shockmaster3> she is made to fight more than one person
[4:24:00] <%SashaStarshine> YEAH DODGE THAT SHIT!
[4:24:01] <shiny_prinny> GOOD DODGES
[4:24:01] <MoonlightP> that's the trick
[4:24:01] <Tennochief> REVENGE
[4:24:02] <BigHugs> Nice dodges there
[4:24:02] <+Jekado> theres the dodge
[4:24:02] <+Grayhammatter> there we go
[4:24:02] <+RenoDeGeneric> Nice dodges
[4:24:04] <%bevyrage> glorious
[4:24:05] <+Ur3an> SICK MOVES
[4:24:06] <lordzarcon_> PogChamp
[4:24:07] <bursky00> See just dodge and she does no damage
[4:24:07] <Nefrette> She is not hard to understand
[4:24:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> good boy Jax
[4:24:10] <vingadivo> good dodge
[4:24:11] <+Ur3an> NICE DODGE
[4:24:17] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat You HAVE to keep killing the wall tentacles
[4:24:21] <KingGrimlock1> delivering pizza du champ right to your door
[4:24:22] <pectusumbra> hit them 2 times, yeah
[4:24:22] <Rotharn> It's ok pat, it's just one of the 144 characters to learn and one of the 5.5 * 10^249 matchups to learn
[4:24:23] <%rj1771> 2 hits and they're dead
[4:24:23] <+PlagueOfGripes> Don't push your lane right now
[4:24:25] <+DinnerCalzone> They're like wards
[4:24:25] <BusterWoIf> WTF? Pat plays League?
[4:24:27] <NiktenKing> When you finish the match, check out her page
[4:24:42] <Finakala> He does now
[4:24:43] <+Ur3an> yeah its like wards
[4:24:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> his CS is pretty terrible
[4:24:59] <vingadivo> pat avoid killing minions quickly so you dont push your wave and die
[4:25:00] <pectusumbra> seriously though, take a look at the map and see if there's any place you can tp to use your ult to fight. you're a tank fighter type. you want to be there to help people
[4:25:01] <+Grayhammatter> he screm
[4:25:06] <mrlastchance1> Yeah but your other lanes fucking lost
[4:25:10] <vigilantic> oh hey,i didnt know the towers had the old ward icons as an item
[4:25:11] <ShineTheDiamond> <3

[4:26:25] <+PlagueOfGripes> maintain the lane so you have easy access to creeps
[4:26:26] <Rotharn> saving yourself 1 tower shot isn't worth a 6 minute cooldown
[4:26:28] <vonpimpenstein> @shabop same... same

[4:26:51] <+Jekado> he engaged with ult
[4:26:51] <BlackermanZX> or not
[4:26:52] <+DinnerCalzone> An important part of fighting Illaoi is learning when *not* to fight her
[4:26:52] <$DrZicter> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[4:26:53] <mrlastchance1> This jax
[4:26:54] <Yimi1> would've been a good time for a flash

[4:26:59] <mrshazboto> I haven't been able to watch live in a while and thought you playing league was a meme.
[4:26:59] <friendlyjoker312> DONT fight her when she has tentacles nearby. The tentacles heal her
[4:26:59] <%Blucarot> @masterfire23 i would love to see that and him trying to connect it to fighting games somehow
[4:27:00] <bursky00> check if she has item advantage over u
[4:27:00] <+leviting> jax just got merked
[4:27:00] <DingusMcBaseball> good ass balancing
[4:27:00] <NiktenKing> RAID BOSS ILLAOI
[4:27:04] <pectusumbra> It's all about not fighting her in her kill zone
[4:27:05] <%Gogogolem> You cann't defeat this buff tentacle woman
[4:27:07] <%SashaStarshine> Jax walked into a triple Tentacle smack
[4:27:08] <pectusumbra> just go somewhere else
[4:27:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Illaoi is the prophet of an Elder God
[4:27:11] <Haarute> it's difficult to fight her in a lane she owns.
[4:27:13] <Owlboy7> you are done in lane LUL
[4:27:13] <MyNameIsRasus> this match is gonna be toughhh
[4:27:14] <shockmaster3> your a brick pat
[4:27:14] <Jeexx> And she's Woolie bait veiEvil
[4:27:15] <Tucker0603> ILLAOI is my girl
[4:27:16] <darkmind95> TELEPORT
[4:27:16] <+Ur3an> TP
[4:27:17] <VritraReiRei> tp?
[4:27:17] <Maverick2736> befitting of a priestess of Cthulhu
[4:27:17] <vingadivo> shes super fun you'll like her when you play it
[4:27:18] <+RenoDeGeneric> Big brown buff lady is cool yes
[4:27:19] <Haarute> you're more of a teamfight boy.
[4:27:20] <beanfriction> Pat is gonna main Illaoi next.
[4:27:20] <MoonlightP> most people would tilt p hard into illaoi
[4:27:21] <MyNameIsRasus> TP
[4:27:22] <KingGrimlock1> @Jeexx no that's vi
[4:27:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah this is really past laning
[4:27:23] <shiny_prinny> too late
[4:27:24] <NiktenKing> She can 1v5 if she really wants to
[4:27:24] <shabop> you basically have to bait out the ult]
[4:27:26] <MyNameIsRasus> too late
[4:27:28] <KingGrimlock1> she's a fucking punch girl
[4:27:29] <+gryffon95> tower
[4:27:31] <+gryffon95> normally
[4:27:33] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Illaoi is a strong lane bully, you do NOT want to fight her if she has wall tentacles around. You must keep on top of killing the tentacles.
[4:27:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> your death
[4:27:33] <MoonlightP> she can only 1v5 if everyone on the enemy team is brainless
[4:27:33] <Rotharn> One of the minions she was killing
[4:27:33] <pectusumbra> look around on the map
[4:27:33] <Blank9> she's easy to fight if you don't just run in
[4:27:34] <ralphfromdk> Her powers might be some of the most "anime" if you know what i mean
[4:27:34] <darkmind95> It's like the spells don't even exist XS
[4:27:35] <Jeexx> It's actually Senna tho eluSmart @KingGrimlock1
[4:27:35] <+korean_random> that's some Woolie bait
[4:27:36] <BlackermanZX> too late
[4:27:36] <Silly_Duckling> since you are having trouble in lane, it might be a better bet to roam
[4:27:42] <KingGrimlock1> all is good
[4:27:44] <%Gogogolem> Pat you migth want to start running aroung ganking with your ult.
[4:27:47] <TheRageofAfrica> Pat is making me want to play Illaoi right now
[4:27:48] <vigilantic> her ult gets stronger the more people are around her and she has a long cooldown style hook that just makes a samage sponge of a person that gives you %dmg taken from it
[4:27:51] <%SashaStarshine> It's rarely a good idea to Teleport to the 2nd turret in a lane
[4:28:02] <%DedlokPM> @BusterWoIf not "oh god I am bad" frustration it was more the "Oh god I can't find a game/matcmaking is slow and when I do it's no lifers" frustration
[4:28:06] <1matheuw> mono malphitet here tthe more armor you get tthe bigger he iss
[4:28:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah, Pat, you should at this point try helping teammates by initiating on enemies they need killed
[4:28:09] <mrlastchance1> There goes diana
[4:28:16] <gloppie> @AngriestPat Malphite is best when in a group, so maybe start following others around
[4:28:26] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Think of that ghost version of you as Surface/Show Off from JoJo Part 4
[4:28:32] <+Ur3an> just run mid and ult talons face
[4:28:32] <%Blucarot> @angriestpat fun fact Jax isn't using a real weapon because if he did he would be too Op in league Canon so he uses a street lamp
[4:28:33] <+Centauren> @AngriestPat Its important to know how to farm when the tower is hitting minions. Let the ranged ones take 1 tower shot and the melees take 2 before hitting them
[4:28:34] <+DrT0M_> @AngriestPat tip for dealing with Illaoi, if her tentacles are still at 2 hits to kill, she's still around
[4:28:38] <mrlastchance1> Open with your ult
[4:28:40] <KingGrimlock1> OLD league canon
[4:28:40] <%ledgefiendd> LMAO
[4:28:43] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat You might want to abandon lane to go gank other lanes with your ult. It's super strong and is a really good setup for kills
[4:28:44] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:28:44] <+Dr_Mooose> oh
[4:28:45] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[4:28:45] <darkmind95> XD
[4:28:46] <shockmaster3> wait isnt pat using ***
[4:28:47] <Rotharn> @AngriestPat I'd reccomend looking up her character on the league fandom wiki after the game, it'll have a better description of her abilities than the ingame client descriptions.
[4:28:48] <Roach3s> oh
[4:28:51] <mrlastchance1> Oh...she can solo baron
[4:28:51] <stretch_marx> welp
[4:28:56] <mrlastchance1> Fun
[4:28:56] <+gryffon95> welp there goes his turret
[4:28:58] <KingGrimlock1> that wasn't baron
[4:28:59] <+DinnerCalzone> That wasn't baron
[4:29:00] <KingGrimlock1> that was rift
[4:29:01] <darkmind95> This is why you use screen lock
[4:29:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> good initiation
[4:29:08] <%Blucarot> that wasn't baron
[4:29:14] <%rj1771> Malph's ult is super strong
[4:29:14] <mrlastchance1> oh
[4:29:14] <Haarute> you can fuck up entire teams with that
[4:29:14] <%Gogogolem> good job pat

[4:29:18] <beanfriction> It's just Harry
[4:29:19] <ralphfromdk> mrlastchance1 That was just the herald (a tiny shitty baron)
[4:29:19] <Silly_Duckling> here's your phd in Malphite, son
[4:29:20] <KingGrimlock1> making it a fucking tactical nuke!
[4:29:21] <mrlastchance1> Oh shit that's right

[4:29:29] <mrlastchance1> yeah I forgot about herald

[4:31:58] <pectusumbra> right moves, wrong time
[4:32:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> Pat underestimates the power of PURCHASED POWER
[4:32:01] <%Agami23> at least they didnt steal dragon
[4:32:01] <shabop> pat has the biggest balls
[4:32:02] <+Ur3an> u coulda backed them teleported
[4:32:02] <%rj1771> Not a bad team fight, that was pretty good
[4:32:04] <Jarvanii> go get em champ
[4:32:04] <mrlastchance1> jax clean up crew?
[4:32:05] <+Grayhammatter> no fear, not even a single one
[4:32:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Balls too big
[4:32:07] <darkmind95> You need the Thorny armor
[4:32:07] <mrlastchance1> nvm
[4:32:08] <Rotharn> It's ok, Pat will learn to be more of a coward when the time comes
[4:32:09] <+DinnerCalzone> God watching new players is a weird experience
[4:32:09] <%DedlokPM> 5% health "I will attack this 75% person
[4:32:09] <vigilantic> it seems you figures out how rock boi engages for a kill
[4:32:09] <Haarute> you were doing okay in the previous fights
[4:32:09] <vingadivo> thats how you counter illaoi just run away
[4:32:13] <+PlagueOfGripes> big money = big big penis
[4:32:13] <NiktenKing> That was good play though pat...just not a good end
[4:32:14] <%Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! apatWink sipsipGasm
[4:32:21] <%Aeoneth> when at 5% you should prob just bail, if your team tries to fight they'll either handle it or they're idiots
[4:32:22] <Monkeyweed21> why is pat supporting farting in people's faces?
[4:32:23] <pectusumbra> you want Cooldown reduction to have ults as much as you can
[4:32:26] <1matheuw> balls to bbig ffor he goddamn tteam
[4:32:27] <+Jekado> with the right build you can go balls deep but not right now
[4:32:28] <%Gogogolem> on the bright side you're doing pretty good considering how fucked you got in lane
[4:32:29] <beanfriction> He's learnbling
[4:32:29] <lordzarcon_> going
[4:32:32] <Madtitan23> that was pretty hype
[4:32:34] <%Bailey__gaming> wtf was that laser gun cha

[4:33:11] <1matheuw> nice
[4:33:11] <bursky00> dont worry ur lux is good
[4:33:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> the enemy team has no group cohesion at least
[4:33:15] <+gryffon95> but mid tower is gone
[4:33:18] <Haarute> malphite is just an ult machine really
[4:33:18] <+gryffon95> so...
[4:33:21] <vingadivo> yup
[4:33:22] <lordzarcon_> yep
[4:33:22] <MyNameIsRasus> His ult is incredible
[4:33:25] <NiktenKing> That is malph's wombo combo potential
[4:33:27] <+PlagueOfGripes> if they can isolate them they might be able to at least break down a lane or two
[4:33:29] <%arcaderabbit48> You guys have a much better teamfight by virtue of you being Malphite, so you might be able to win this
[4:33:29] <shabop> malph is 70% ult
[4:33:30] <QuaiRolDor> what the fuck am iseeing?
[4:33:32] <%XxBTExX> plague you should play with pat
[4:33:32] <+Jekado> does pat know that tanks usually need to initiate with the CC?
[4:33:33] <KingGrimlock1> i used to think malphite's head was a giant nose
[4:33:36] <Blank9> anivia is my favorite ult
[4:33:38] <Monkeyweed21> @AngriestPat why do you support farting in peoples' faces?
[4:33:39] <Blank9> just for spam

[4:35:21] <BlackermanZX> Thornmail is gonna help a lot
[4:35:21] <shiny_prinny> they don't have much AP so you can go all armor
[4:35:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> But she is full Physical damage
[4:35:29] <MyNameIsRasus> it IS

[4:37:20] <Tucker0603> I love her, she's my number 3 best girl
[4:37:20] <BlackermanZX> And Talon gets all the honor LUL
[4:37:21] <%SilentEric> Pat you could have had Illaoi, but you got Garen for free too. I tried to tell you that first stream!
[4:37:22] <vigilantic> you actually learned how to manage against her well halfway through the game pat,cant say the same for that team when she ulted
[4:37:24] <%XxBTExX> Ileolie
[4:37:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @PlagueOfGripes Never, ever, ever stop going in and always stick around when you're at only 5% health
[4:37:27] <Finaldragoon> *4 hours later*

[4:37:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> SHES SUPER STRONG
[4:37:43] <%CalderGaming> @GarbageNirvana yeah, a legit win and an opponent forfeit
[4:37:44] <ambadev> oi oi oi
[4:37:47] <%Fenrirlives> Illaoi a good!
[4:37:48] <+DinnerCalzone> She's strong against people who don't know what she does
[4:37:48] <%ThatOneGameTester> ill ow ee
[4:37:49] <gloppie> Don't listen to meta talk at your level haha @AngriestPat
[4:37:51] <+meowmeow7t> ill owwy

[4:38:03] <kindashagg> eel-owwie
[4:38:03] <%ThatOneGameTester> ill ow oui
[4:38:03] <sirscumbag13> Harsh Lesson = Dunk
[4:38:12] <%SashaStarshine> A good player will not lose to Illaoi but bad players means she can get pentakills really easilly
[4:38:14] <+Dr_Mooose> she slap and she bop
[4:38:25] <+ZenVulgarity> Thanks for the HahaThisisfine @baronblank
[4:38:31] <+Imperial_Madman> she looks cool
[4:38:32] <pectusumbra> I'll be honest I forgot that last part
[4:38:37] <Tennochief> GET DUNKED ON
[4:38:37] <sirscumbag13> Big Dunk
[4:38:38] <RushUnplugged> nice subtle way to call Pat bad
[4:38:40] <+DinnerCalzone> So she can double up damage against you if a tentacle hits you and the spirit
[4:38:42] <+chase959> and the ghost from her E
[4:38:44] <Jeexx> The Spirit counts as a champion, too eluRk
[4:38:45] <CptCreampuff16> Pat its best when in the load screen to look up enemy champ on wiki so you know what youre up against
[4:38:46] <NiktenKing> Including the spirit
[4:38:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> That includes the Vessel
[4:38:48] <Haarute> we learnin'
[4:38:49] <+chase959> it also spawns one
[4:38:49] <%SashaStarshine> @RushUnplugged Why thank you
[4:38:57] <Aydarkzero> hello
[4:38:58] <+Imperial_Madman> hello
[4:38:58] <beanfriction> Is there a Dunkmaster Illaoi skin now?
[4:38:58] <cham52> Pat, how is Paige??
[4:39:00] <vingadivo> check out nasus pat
[4:39:01] <+Imperial_Madman> how is the cube
[4:39:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> Mid? PogChamp
[4:39:05] <+PlagueOfGripes> your problem is more your basic CSing and lane discipline
[4:39:11] <%Valdorick> !uptime
[4:39:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 39m.
[4:39:12] <Clamydomonas> yay legend league!
[4:39:14] <Clamydomonas> :D
[4:39:15] <%Chichen> pat if you shrink any more you'll stop existing BibleThump
[4:39:17] <%Aeoneth> is Kayle good in the game now, she was my favorite when I played
[4:39:18] <mrlastchance1> Yeah, practice them last hits
[4:39:19] <%arcaderabbit48> @beanfriction No, but she has a Fuck Skynet skin
[4:39:20] <%ButterMyBrisket> :)
[4:39:20] <+CaptainJax> give Tahm Kench a shot, he's neat as hell
[4:39:23] <%ThatOneGameTester> What Plague said, also, hi Plague.
[4:39:31] <%SilentEric> Play Neeko! She is free this week
[4:39:33] <gloppie> Yeah its counterintuitive, but getting last hits is way more important than getting champ kills
[4:39:33] <beanfriction> @arcaderabbit48 Noice
[4:39:38] <%SilentEric> You'll like Neeko's passive!
[4:39:42] <%arcaderabbit48> @Aeoneth Received a full rework a while back, she is very fun and good now
[4:39:43] <+doe3879> If you wana learn the character, RIOT makes Character Spotlight for all the characters
[4:39:44] <Aydarkzero> you did though
[4:39:49] <KingGrimlock1> 2 YEARS, JESUS
[4:39:52] <elspiceweasel> 100% PATS FAULT
[4:39:55] <vigilantic> fun thing you can do with rock boi,he can build like a mage since his moves do too much magic damage espicially the q and ult leading to him instantly killing high damage champions from a distance
[4:39:55] <%XxBTExX> @PlagueOfGripes that comes with experience though. I do agree he should aim for at least 50 cs per 10 minutes
[4:40:05] <OldManDeckardCain> When's the Pat and Plague duo queue streams spent more on talking about Star Trek instead of playing lol
[4:40:12] <%Aeoneth> Sick, if you don't mind a couple more, how are Orianna and Leona?
[4:40:13] <%nmaten> for lane phase yeah
[4:40:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> typically
[4:40:22] <+xddddsorandom> If you do that people get big mad
[4:40:24] <NiktenKing> Honestly, help your strongest link
[4:40:24] <%SashaStarshine> For the earlygame, but midgame you're more free
[4:40:25] <pectusumbra> It DOES
[4:40:26] <%SilentEric> During laning phase, but you can roam.
[4:40:28] <+Thisigia> Yep
[4:40:29] <%linSP> infinite stun
[4:40:32] <Nekros4442> Dota 2 is all about positioning to deal with the cc
[4:40:32] <zamzoph> dota stuns are forever
[4:40:33] <+DinnerCalzone> CC in dota is wack
[4:40:33] <ristos237> dota has like 4 second stuns on normal abilities
[4:40:34] <+thecho1> DOTA fucks you up with stuns
[4:40:34] <%XxBTExX> Leona is the stun queen
[4:40:34] <elspiceweasel> yeah, dota can get nuts
[4:40:34] <pectusumbra> Also yeah you would probably like Leona as a support
[4:40:35] <%CalderGaming> orianna's fun but takes precision
[4:40:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> We have fancy types of stuns too@
[4:40:37] <1matheuw> dota has 10 sec plus stuns get the fuckout
[4:40:37] <%Gogogolem> Does dota have a surrender button yet?
[4:40:37] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat he meant like, if you ADC isn't pulling their wieght then just leave them to die
[4:40:37] <friendlyjoker312> The job of a support is to help those who are able to win you the game
[4:40:39] <cham52> Dota has stuns that last like 30 seconds
[4:40:39] <beanfriction> Support goes bot to funnel gold and exp into your ADCs starving gullet, usually
[4:40:42] <+PlagueOfGripes> boy do I not miss the era of no support items. you just were not allowed to have gold
[4:40:42] <ristos237> as a league player its buck fucking wild
[4:40:42] <NiktenKing> Be Leona, stun the world
[4:40:42] <bursky00> Ow u get chained stunned to death in dota with 4k hp
[4:40:43] <pectusumbra> I like leona a lot myself
[4:40:45] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Dota always copies league
[4:40:48] <Darkrenai> ROCK SOLID
[4:40:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> we have stun, break, silence, disarm etc.
[4:40:51] <KingGrimlock1> dota came before league @Dr_Donkey_Brains
[4:40:52] <CurrySauseBandit> It does, but people take AGES to kill as well in some cases, so it's nessacary against some heroes.
[4:40:54] <cham52> ROCK SOLID
[4:40:54] <Jeexx> veiYes
[4:40:54] <%SilentEric> NEEKO though!

[4:41:05] <cham52> MORDE
[4:41:05] <beanfriction> Ban Malphite for Malphite
[4:41:06] <Bloodxb> fiora or morde
[4:41:06] <KingGrimlock1> pat you don't firstpick malphite
[4:41:06] <vigilantic> morde
[4:41:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat is a Top confirmed
[4:41:06] <%Nordguy> you are ADIØDICTED
[4:41:06] <+Centauren> Morde

[4:41:10] <+CaptainJax> @AngriestPat Try out Tahm Kench, he's a cool dude
[4:41:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> your sinful last hit fingers I hope
[4:41:12] <BlackermanZX> Illaoi or Morde
[4:41:12] <vigilantic> mordekaiser and teemo
[4:41:13] <%SilentEric> Teemo is free!
[4:41:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WTF League came from Dota
[4:41:17] <+Elky3> all of the champs rooH
[4:41:21] <Darkrenai> Mordekaiser is fucked right now top lane
[4:41:25] <+Ur3an> Morde is omega strong
[4:41:25] <cham52> Fun fact: League invented videogames
[4:41:25] <+OneGorillionDollars> ban teemo
[4:41:26] <pectusumbra> As mal you want Armor, AP, and mana
[4:41:26] <shiny_prinny> you prob won't see too many fiora's at this level
[4:41:27] <+Centauren> @CaptainJax Tahm is no longer a real champ tho
[4:41:27] <%SashaStarshine> And Pat be smarter with mana usage on Malphite
[4:41:31] <elspiceweasel> need lessdekaiser
[4:41:32] <%SashaStarshine> He runs out super fast
[4:41:33] <+SparkyOcelot212> has he fought a vayne top yet?
[4:41:39] <TechDragon_Z> Again?
[4:41:39] <%XxBTExX> Leona is one of the easiest supports to use and she can stunlock people.
[4:41:40] <vingadivo> check out nasus pat
[4:41:44] <beanfriction> Aw ye Warwick jungle. What a good boy.
[4:41:46] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat pat you were always small
[4:41:47] <%SilentEric> Even if its after the stream, try Neeko while she is free. She can do any lane.
[4:41:49] <PhantaniumOG> His q costs a lot
[4:41:50] <CurrySauseBandit> @xerosigmaprime Thinking LoL players know Dota history about their own game LUL
[4:41:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> I wonder if they ever fixed Annie top
[4:41:54] <%SashaStarshine> PYKE IS HARD
[4:41:56] <+jiggy_snipe> stuns
[4:41:58] <Darkrenai> Death is the best CC
[4:41:59] <Kiari13> LUL
[4:41:59] <+Jontman42> Pyke is difficult
[4:42:00] <bursky00> Don't even try lol
[4:42:01] <Nefrette> they did plague
[4:42:01] <pectusumbra> oh hi plague!
[4:42:02] <+gryffon95> he gives the kills to the adc
[4:42:03] <+Ur3an> Death is the best CC
[4:42:04] <ItsMarchii> Hes not
[4:42:05] <%SilentEric> Pyke is an assassin support.
[4:42:05] <EndgameContent> When mages are weak, they become supports
[4:42:06] <+gryffon95> with his ult
[4:42:07] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat CAUSE HE HAS A HOOK LUL
[4:42:08] <cherrycottontail> Just play poppy already
[4:42:10] <%XxBTExX> you "support" by killing them faster than they kill you
[4:42:11] <friendlyjoker312> If pyke kills someone it shares the gold
[4:42:11] <ItsMarchii> hes just a assasin
[4:42:12] <%arcaderabbit48> Pyke is not a good beginner support
[4:42:12] <+CarlosEoM> he shares money when he kills
[4:42:14] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat he shares the kills
[4:42:16] <ItsAGundamu> Smite does not have a fighing game
[4:42:18] <vingadivo> his ult gives gold to teamates
[4:42:19] <%Sephirios> hook and stun +his kills give bonus gold to allys
[4:42:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> there's no way he could play Poppy
[4:42:20] <ristos237> pyke is kind of hard
[4:42:24] <beanfriction> "Death is the best CC" and so on.
[4:42:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @CurrySauseBandit HAHA you right, can trust em to learn anything more than AOE boxes and CSing
[4:42:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat, focus on killing minions. It may not look like it, but it makes the hugest difference
[4:42:28] <KingGrimlock1> plague annie top hasn't been a thing like ever
[4:42:29] <CptCreampuff16> he pulls people into the waters and kills them and gives who ever helped him kill the gold
[4:42:31] <Simicrisps> Aw sweet, my first time catching Pat's LoL stream.
[4:42:31] <%NSwarmlord> He has the cc and good roams and he gives his allies the gold of the kills he gets with his ult
[4:42:35] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Pyke = Assassin Support, if you kill someone with his ult the last person that hit him gets the same gold as though they got the kill.
[4:42:36] <%arancet> arancet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Why does Elmo, the largest baby, simply not eat the other two?

[4:43:15] <Renkage> You are forced to wait 5 minutes
[4:43:16] <Darkrenai> They have wait timers everytime you dodge

[4:43:17] <%SashaStarshine> You do! but only for 5-15 minutes
[4:43:17] <sirscumbag13> You do get a penalty for doing it to some extent
[4:43:18] <friendlyjoker312> You get a 15 minute ban

[4:43:19] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat I wish you got extra experience for having to put up with that

[4:43:22] <shiny_prinny> you get 30 min wait i think

[4:44:16] <%mostundesired> SINGLE FEMALE LAWYER
[4:44:18] <%SoFarFetched> bye yasuo LUL
[4:44:18] <KingGrimlock1> THIS DUDE WANNA PLAY YASUO SO BAD
[4:44:20] <vingadivo> pat if you like malphite you'll love cho gath
[4:44:21] <%arcaderabbit48> @Simicrisps He got a new ult a while back, and his sapling babies are stronger
[4:44:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BULLSHIT'
[4:44:22] <+Ur3an> LOL this guy
[4:44:23] <+RenoDeGeneric> Top is NOT the least popular
[4:44:24] <%SilentEric> Ornn is great.
[4:44:24] <+Ur3an> HAHAHA
[4:44:25] <%SashaStarshine> Top is weaker than support right now
[4:44:26] <+jiggy_snipe> support is least popular
[4:44:27] <DumbSnowyFace> nah everyone hates top lol
[4:44:27] <KingGrimlock1> it has no inlfluence on the game
[4:44:27] <NiktenKing> Jungle
[4:44:28] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> You wait till you deal with Zed's and Yasuo every game
[4:44:28] <vigilantic> top bois are usually buff big bois, they also are so in leauge @angriestpat
[4:44:32] <+xXWoadXx> in higher elo support is more popular
[4:44:33] <Renkage> Jungle is the least popular role. Because EVERYTHING IS YOUR FAULT!
[4:44:34] <shockmaster3> its support
[4:44:34] <DumbSnowyFace> top is a boring island no one wants
[4:44:35] <+HimRoman> jungle is least pop
[4:44:38] <vingadivo> jungle actually
[4:44:38] <Simicrisps> @arcaderabbit48 Ah, cool. Thanks!
[4:44:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> I typically played support to avoid the screaming
[4:44:39] <zayasu> riven monkaS
[4:44:41] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat most top players ban akali now
[4:44:42] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat In Ranked play, Top is the least popular
[4:44:44] <cham52> hey i wasnt around did pat stop to eat at any point during the stream?
[4:44:45] <dalollypop> ADC is the least popular role
[4:44:47] <Nefrette> Support is more popular than top
[4:44:47] <BlackermanZX> Oh fuck a Riven
[4:44:48] <%abakkus> lets play what could those stars be
[4:44:50] <Blank9> jungle is definitely least popular
[4:44:52] <%SashaStarshine> @GunToad I do love sitting on my ass and pressing Q on the other guy for 15 minutes
[4:44:52] <VritraReiRei> It's usually Jungle or Support that are the most demanding roles
[4:44:53] <KingGrimlock1> no jugnle is one of the most popular recently
[4:44:53] <bursky00> Mid>Adc>Top>Jungle>support basically.
[4:44:54] <+HimRoman> jungle
[4:44:55] <+Jontman42> Depends on the skill level to a degree I'd assume
[4:44:56] <friendlyjoker312> MID and ADC are the most popular followed by JG and TOP, SUP being the least populare
[4:44:57] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh shit Riven
[4:44:57] <NiktenKing> Jungle because nobody fucking knows how to play it
[4:44:58] <KingGrimlock1> due to how much influence you have
[4:44:59] <shozent> NOBODY plays jungle
[4:44:59] <shiny_prinny> Top lane gets camped in ranked
[4:44:59] <DumbSnowyFace> least impact
[4:45:04] <%Aeoneth> Support is just being tired mom internally screaming stop hitting yourselves you idiots
[4:45:04] <shozent> Jungle is the fill role
[4:45:04] <+xddddsorandom> You'll see when you're older Pat
[4:45:06] <darkmind95> Support < ADC < Top < Jungle < Mid?
[4:45:07] <dalollypop> ADC is autofill 60% of the time
[4:45:07] <%Lunchbox5353> Lunchbox5353 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[4:45:08] <KingGrimlock1> junglers are HUGELY influential in the game
[4:45:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Because Top lane has the least impact on the game
[4:45:09] <%Lunchbox5353> Lunchbox5353's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[4:45:11] <ItsMarchii> least impacr
[4:45:11] <KingGrimlock1> same w/ mid
[4:45:14] <fragdar> yo @AngriestPat .. try shaco man
[4:45:15] <vingadivo> pat check out cho gath and nasus you'll like them
[4:45:15] <Darkrenai> No one wanted to be support so they had to start autofilling people for it LUL
[4:45:15] <+HimRoman> jungle que timeis 5 seconds
[4:45:16] <RushUnplugged> I'm just mentally replacing League with gay roles, all this top/bottom talk makes more sense
[4:45:16] <vigilantic> i think top has more impact more because of how dumb herald is now
[4:45:17] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Top gets less popular the higher you go in ranked
[4:45:17] <pectusumbra> you are probably fighting riven
[4:45:18] <Nefrette> Matchmaking lies alot
[4:45:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Depends on the meta really
[4:45:19] <Klefth> Because top lane gets ganked the easiest and people get frustrated @AngriestPat
[4:45:22] <Reodi> no jungle is lest popular i believe you get auto filled prtected if you play support or jungle
[4:45:23] <%SilentEric> That's been like that for multiple seasons.
[4:45:23] <+Ur3an> Not anymotr
[4:45:25] <+xddddsorandom> RIVEN TIME
[4:45:26] <pectusumbra> so armor armoro armor
[4:45:29] <+xddddsorandom> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IT
[4:45:29] <+Ur3an> with rift herald
[4:45:30] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> @AngriestPat Wait till you play with Yasuo's and Zed's every game.
[4:45:30] <shozent> ADC is the best role FIGHT ME
[4:45:31] <elspiceweasel> HA look at this noob trying to enjoy a moba!
[4:45:31] <+Ur3an> and tp
[4:45:32] <%ThatOneGameTester> because if you're bad at top you can't usually blame anyone else for it Kappa
[4:45:32] <Blank9> top plays their own game and hopes they did well and comes out doing good
[4:45:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> people always want to be the kill star, so Top isn't popular because that's the tank lane for whoever ends up not carrying, typically
[4:45:37] <+NeonTurnip> oh no
[4:45:39] <%abakkus> ugh ekko is gorgeous even in their icon
[4:45:40] <ralphfromdk> We just saw a top lane win a game.... "least impact" my arse
[4:45:41] <MoonlightP> people telling you top isn't impactful are probably talking from a higher level perspective
[4:45:41] <%Aeoneth> fuck like 3 of the enemy team are my favs
[4:45:41] <+SparkyOcelot212> oh no
[4:45:42] <%GunToad> oh boy riven
[4:45:44] <elspiceweasel> dont you know youre supposed to hate the game youre playing?
[4:45:48] <MoonlightP> at your level top is perfectly fine to carry from
[4:45:50] <+Imperial_Madman> Temo is best
[4:45:50] <+SparkyOcelot212> oh lawd she comin
[4:45:50] <Darkrenai> Riven
[4:45:51] <NiktenKing> Riven
[4:45:52] <+gryffon95> @ThatOneGameTester you can blame the jungler
[4:45:53] <%SilentEric> THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOURS TRULY
[4:45:53] <MoonlightP> basically it's like, crush lane win game
[4:45:54] <MoonlightP> every game
[4:45:55] <%SashaStarshine> OH THIS IS A FUN MATCHUP
[4:45:57] <Nefrette> RIVEN BOI
[4:45:57] <KingGrimlock1> you only get autofill protected if you play support
[4:45:58] <zayasu> THATS YOUR TEAM

[4:46:02] <NiktenKing> That's your team

[4:46:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> Yi is sam fisher weeb
[4:46:10] <%SilentEric> EKKO and RIVEN!
[4:46:11] <%SashaStarshine> Malphite destroys Riven
[4:46:17] <emzspurs> @angriestpat just build armor and you auto win
[4:46:17] <shiny_prinny> accurate
[4:46:18] <+HimRoman> riven is mad stun
[4:46:18] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh fuck Riven
[4:46:20] <KingGrimlock1> titties
[4:46:21] <%Aeoneth> Sona is great
[4:46:23] <+King_floppy> Triiiist
[4:46:24] <dalollypop> hahah pat knows
[4:46:24] <vingadivo> cho gath is a big tank that gets bigger the more champions he eats until hes the side of a dragon
[4:46:25] <friendlyjoker312> "Fuck this bitch" Thats the correct reaction
[4:46:25] <zayasu> riven Kreygasm
[4:46:25] <NiktenKing> Riven is... dirty
[4:46:25] <KingGrimlock1> @AngriestPat rush ninja tabis
[4:46:26] <%Aeoneth> just faceroll and win
[4:46:26] <+CarlosEoM> she's either really good or terrible
[4:46:27] <%SilentEric> Sona has a gamer cube
[4:46:29] <cham52> Sona is fine alright
[4:46:29] <1matheuw> who teh fuq is sonia
[4:46:29] <+gryffon95> pat ekko is just that bitch from overwatch
[4:46:29] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> You got Ryze, you're fine if the player has basic understanding.
[4:46:29] <Maxicqwe> youre againts one of the most hated champions of the game
[4:46:29] <%rj1771> Riven is super ez....unless they know their cancels.
[4:46:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> is AP Tristana still a thing
[4:46:30] <pectusumbra> fucking ekko. I don't know what trist does anymore. You're righting riven most likely
[4:46:32] <%SoFarFetched> Gotta get them Riven mods for warframe
[4:46:32] <hieguy> It said that because it was your secondary role not because its unpopular
[4:46:35] <dalollypop> Riven WutFace
[4:46:35] <+gryffon95> tracer*
[4:46:37] <shozent> Trist is who was free when you started
[4:46:37] <KingGrimlock1> no plague
[4:46:38] <MoonlightP> riven is a woolie character
[4:46:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay, bright side is the enemy team lacks a tank
[4:46:41] <cham52> I really hope AP tristana is still a thing
[4:46:42] <+thecho1> @AngriestPat riven is actually more like a fighting game character than most champs
[4:46:44] <+xddddsorandom> PlagueOfGripes No but regular Tristana is pretty broken right now
[4:46:45] <Bloodxb> lux has that $30 dollar skin
[4:46:45] <shozent> So a lot of shitters used her, but shes actually great
[4:46:48] <MoonlightP> riven has cancels plus she's a cool fight girl
[4:46:50] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat In this matchup maxing E is a lot more impactful than maxing Q
[4:46:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> she's always broken.
[4:46:51] <%Aeoneth> Riven is super fun
[4:46:52] <zayasu> riven and vi sbfpYeyeye
[4:46:52] <Darkrenai> Rock solid
[4:46:55] <+King_floppy> when's shortstack Trist skin
[4:46:56] <+SparkyOcelot212> ap trist still works
[4:46:57] <%Aeoneth> Combo people for big damage
[4:47:00] <@commanderclaw> For the love of god, cs more and push less
[4:47:01] <vigilantic> oh i see pat doesnt have the option that tells you how much mana a move cost
[4:47:01] <+xddddsorandom> Even MORE broken than usual
[4:47:05] <Rotharn> riven = "Q, slash, slash, knockup-slash; W, short aoe stun; E, dash that gives her a sheild; R, increased damage, reactivate for an AoE execute wave"
[4:47:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Riven and Vi are totally Woolie bait LUL
[4:47:08] <cham52> Trist is already a shortstack she's got that booty
[4:47:10] <+Tyonidus> Guys why in the FUCK would you be recommending Riven to Pat?
[4:47:13] <KingGrimlock1> riven is entirely about animation canceling your shit to dump out as much damage as possible so the enemy laner can't realistically react to it
[4:47:14] <1matheuw> ye
[4:47:15] <BlackermanZX> Yes
[4:47:15] <%rj1771> Riven is a diver, yes.
[4:47:16] <%SilentEric> Try out Neeko while she is free. She can do any lane.
[4:47:16] <shozent> Shortstacks a best
[4:47:16] <ristos237> riven is so much fun, shes my highest mastery points before i stopped playing top
[4:47:16] <VritraReiRei> @PlagueOfGripes it's mostly dead, ratios are near non-existant
[4:47:17] <Rotharn> E gives you armor, she does all physical damage
[4:47:17] <%SashaStarshine> She also blocks poke with a free shield
[4:47:17] <shiny_prinny> yi pinged for a leash
[4:47:17] <KingGrimlock1> she's not complicated
[4:47:17] <friendlyjoker312> She is a rushdown character
[4:47:21] <pectusumbra> exactly. she's a soul calibur character
[4:47:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah. All the time. Forever.
[4:47:23] <+DeathGripsftGillesDeleuze> Riven is hot
[4:47:24] <+lunr_knight> your champion literally looks like a pile of shit
[4:47:24] <+HimRoman> help yi
[4:47:25] <+Tyonidus> That character requires so much knowledge to play well....
[4:47:27] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat likes the big bois tho
[4:47:28] <Tucker0603> poppy is the best shotstack, she may girl
[4:47:29] <branlomanche> your e decrease attack speed
[4:47:30] <+Jontman42> Riven is one of those where the one-tricks just destroy games and everyone else is bad with her
[4:47:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> ward you dumb slut
[4:47:30] <gloppie> @AngriestPat Try to only hit the enemy minions for the last hit. Wailing on them pushes the lane and leaves you open to jungler ganks
[4:47:33] <shozent> Pat hes so boring
[4:47:34] <+ZenVulgarity> Has Pat tried Darius yet
[4:47:34] <%arcaderabbit48> She is literally a rushdown character
[4:47:36] <T_Sasquatch> Everyone likes short stacks until its time to fuck a midget
[4:47:36] <%rj1771> Malph can be super strong
[4:47:37] <bursky00> Riven is where you learn how to moonwalk
[4:47:37] <+Grayhammatter> she never stops going in ?
[4:47:40] <nobknee> Rocks are CLEAN. @AngriestPat
[4:47:40] <Naphtali61> Her on-demand shield makes your q harass less effective
[4:47:42] <beanfriction> Steal his buff
[4:47:43] <emzspurs> @angriestpat also you hava mana issues until you buy a couple mana items so dont spam too much
[4:47:43] <cham52> Pat's got rocks for brains
[4:47:45] <VJdarkworld> dwayne The Rock johnson :O
[4:47:46] <+Ur3an> Press ctrl + 1
[4:47:46] <MoonlightP> malph is op when the enemy team has no ap threat
[4:47:46] <KingGrimlock1> @Rotharn his W gives him armor

[4:54:50] <Onatamana> tiem to leave
[4:54:50] <mrlastchance1> b
[4:54:55] <elspiceweasel> i just recruited a jogger with a peg leg in rimworld
[4:54:56] <+xddddsorandom> Pat needs to learn how to use his abilities to kill minions
[4:54:57] <+2DSuperiority> hit minion when minion almost dead, big good
[4:54:58] <bursky00> b
[4:54:59] <vingadivo> pat has been gettign better at csing he just needs to get better at going base
[4:55:00] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat B
[4:55:05] <Rhinoprotoss> WHYYY
[4:55:06] <vingadivo> baseeeee
[4:55:08] <%NSwarmlord> NO HITTING MINIONS AT ALL TIMES IS THE MANLY THING TO DO
[4:55:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat only attack the minions when you're sure you're gonna kill them. That's what last hitting means
[4:55:12] <emzspurs> BUY MANA
[4:55:15] <+PlagueOfGripes> one day he will learn the power of frequent Returns
[4:55:19] <%linSP> its fine
[4:55:32] <zamzoph> one day...
[4:55:34] <twoya> has Pat ever purchased a control ward
[4:55:37] <vingadivo> pat wait for ult then kill
[4:55:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat used to work in retail. You'd think he'd be an expert in dealing with Returns
[4:55:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> first you get the money, then you get ze women
[4:55:40] <AfroKing24> who needs to kill minions when rivens gonna feed him LUL
[4:55:42] <beanfriction> Pat's never going to use the corrupting potion, is he?
[4:55:43] <+HimRoman> pat with malphite you can build as a tank or a high damage ap rock man
[4:55:44] <+lazylazzer> It's so weird watching someone new play. They don't right click 100x per second.
[4:55:46] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't understand anything that's going on...
[4:55:48] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't Pat knows what a control ward is
[4:55:49] <pectusumbra> then you get the cooldown reduction
[4:55:52] <Blank9> pat should anivia, then you get ult and don't have to worry about last hit
[4:55:52] <%SashaStarshine> Then you zell ze women for ze money
[4:55:53] <%linSP> yeaaaa get im!
[4:55:54] <emzspurs> @twoya that doesnt matter at this point of experience :)
[4:55:54] <darkmind95> Minioooons
[4:55:57] <%Blucarot> CS
[4:55:59] <%Blucarot> noooo
[4:55:59] <Blank9> it just happens automatically
[4:55:59] <VritraReiRei> @MyNameIsRasus he knows about last hitting, he just hasn't learned how to do it yet. which he will eventually
[4:56:00] <MyNameIsRasus> SHOCKERRR
[4:56:00] <+Entking> @AngriestPat ive played league for 10 years, awesome to see you playing lol
[4:56:01] <twoya> fair point
[4:56:02] <MoonlightP> next time riven runs up on you just come at her and R
[4:56:03] <gloppie> @AngriestPat Getting the last hit on minions is more important than champ kills
[4:56:06] <T_Sasquatch> I don't know what a ward looks like lmao
[4:56:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I always hate how tower aggro works in League, its so fucking passive
[4:56:11] <vingadivo> MINIONS PAT PLEASE THEY'RE MORE IMPORTANT THAN KILLS

[4:56:23] <+CarlosEoM> its fine
[4:56:23] <+lazylazzer> it was a FLEX
[4:56:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah, Pat's biggest weakness right now is that he dramatically overvalues attacking enemies and undervalues CS
[4:56:27] <1matheuw> ulted for zoning nice plan
[4:56:28] <bursky00> let riven initiate pat it's a cooldown fight against her
[4:56:28] <Rotharn> It's ok pat, you can try again in TWO MINUTES
[4:56:28] <%Tallie> rssQ
[4:56:29] <Jarvanii> you have to wait for her to go on you
[4:56:29] <+CaptainJax> Good mind games pat
[4:56:30] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> It's okay, she's afraid of you.
[4:56:30] <sirscumbag13> It was a warning shot
[4:56:31] <+Centauren> f
[4:56:32] <MoonlightP> it's ok, just asserting your dominance in line

[4:56:35] <%dopeslowbro> dopeslowbro's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[4:56:36] <Jarvanii> you have 0 chance of killing her like that
[4:56:37] <Bloodxb> a show of dominance

[4:56:46] <+CaptainJax> she's fucking terrified of you
[4:56:51] <MyNameIsRasus> @VritraReiRei yeah, just trying to offer advice. I know it takes time for these things
[4:56:52] <dankestank> I'm pretty sure Fire Cape is still the right choice here since he can't CS and all of Riven's damage is physical.
[4:56:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> no glory in minion kills
[4:56:55] <+Caped_Eggy> "I don't need my ult to kill you"
[4:56:55] <zamzoph> at least the riven isn't doing much better in cs
[4:57:02] <kruggalo> HE GOT THE CANNON!
[4:57:03] <MoonlightP> pat actually killed a cannon
[4:57:04] <%Blucarot> too be fair he's crushing riven
[4:57:06] <+Grayhammatter> she's scared for sure
[4:57:06] <AfroKing24> pats fine this riven is ass
[4:57:07] <MoonlightP> that's improvement
[4:57:08] <OldManDeckardCain> Pat's top lane looks more like Smite's solo lane LUL
[4:57:12] <Goldenwolf98> Pat only has bloodlust for people not minions
[4:57:13] <+Ur3an> useptos
[4:57:15] <+PlagueOfGripes> every missed cannon minion kills a stream chatter
[4:57:16] <+CaptainJax> use corrupting pot
[4:57:20] <+Ur3an> use pots they give mana

[5:02:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> "I'll just regen under the tower"
[5:02:07] <+jiggy_snipe> all they know how to do is go in
[5:02:10] <%Who_lio42> GO GET EM CHAMP
[5:02:11] <RushUnplugged> Pat did a stinky?
[5:02:12] <shiny_prinny> Yi needed you to tank the turret to kill her
[5:02:14] <dankestank> Pat knows about wards right?
[5:02:19] <%Entking> Entking subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:02:20] <%rj1771> @AngriestPat Don't forget to ward! You don't wanna get flanked!
[5:02:20] <%Entking> Entking's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[5:02:20] <aubrea> i used to play yi, can confirm
[5:02:22] <beanfriction> Pat knows about wards
[5:02:27] <emzspurs> @angriestpat use your corrupting potion for mana
[5:02:28] <aubrea> 1 track mind
[5:02:30] <zayasu> HahaCat
[5:02:33] <pectusumbra> you probably want a ward in that bush
[5:02:37] <ashuckel> he knows that they exist, not how to use it
[5:02:41] <KingGrimlock1> i love how pat hasn't use corrupting ONCE yet
[5:02:43] <aubrea> and that 1 track is going in
[5:02:46] <%NSwarmlord> Focusing on your own champion has always been one of the biggest hurdles to getting good
[5:02:47] <pectusumbra> oooo, actually pat, go right and see if the blue golem is there
[5:02:47] <+robro_> keep the toxic chat in league not here lol
[5:02:53] <mrblack499> are there over games later or is this it?
[5:02:55] <resorcfulraven> I can hear plauges comments in his voice.
[5:02:55] <Reodi> yea that potion you bought gives hp and a little mana iirc
[5:02:58] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i still cannot fucking believe i'm watching pat play league
[5:02:58] <Jarvanii> why contain it
[5:02:59] <%Who_lio42> Pat: Ward sounds like COWARD, which I am not
[5:03:04] <$Zalthia> I can't tell if this is making me nostalgic or not.
[5:03:08] <+Shackle_Rustyford> what year is this
[5:03:10] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[5:03:14] <T_Sasquatch> Is pat using quick cast ?
[5:03:17] <Katmon27> the potion gives more damage too
[5:03:24] <KingGrimlock1> only 15 over 3 seconds

[5:04:06] <dankestank> We shouldn't get on his case too much about his ults or warding, R and 4 and long reaches for those baby hands.
[5:04:09] <MoonlightP> yi should have saved alpha strike
[5:04:09] <+Grayhammatter> Yi went in HARD

[5:04:11] <%Zeahk> Classic Yi.
[5:04:11] <Silly_Duckling> nothin beats that
[5:04:24] <friendlyjoker312> Yi is the cool aid
[5:04:26] <VritraReiRei> @PlagueOfGripes do you mind if i ask if you played ranked and how far you got?
[5:04:27] <NJigglypuff> keep in mind this is the yi who wanted to go yasuo jg but he got banned
[5:04:29] <T_Sasquatch> @shackle_rustyford literally just play it, it becomes second nature
[5:04:30] <+jiggy_snipe> will Pat get an S if he gets 100 farm and doesn't die?
[5:04:36] <KingGrimlock1> DEATH INCOMING
[5:04:39] <%mostundesired> Avenged, tho
[5:04:41] <pectusumbra> vengence is okay

[5:05:05] <%SashaStarshine> @jiggy_snipe S- maybe, especially if he gets better at warding
[5:05:12] <%rj1771> Rat Man shouldn't have tried to 1v1 Ekko
[5:05:12] <vingadivo> GO BASE BUY ITENS
[5:05:13] <pectusumbra> pat, that little cubby hole, see if the enemy blue buff is up. you can get lots of mana and cooldown reduction from it
[5:05:14] <+CaptainJax> pat's helping
[5:05:15] <1matheuw> is okay pat i also forget i have flash
[5:05:15] <Onatamana> He's gotta learn when to tank a few turret hits
[5:05:19] <KingGrimlock1> PAT: "my work here is done"
[5:05:23] <shabop> brand too good
[5:05:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> you have 2k. buy
[5:05:26] <resorcfulraven> Ive been playing leauge for 10 seasons still have 0 ELO
[5:05:28] <+DeathGripsftGillesDeleuze> who's the enemy jungler anyway?
[5:05:28] <+Shackle_Rustyford> @T_Sasquatch its not so much not being good at the clicking, i just dont LIKE the clicking. i like the idea of all the character matchups and the general flow of the game itself but the thought of so much clicking just turns me off of the entire genre
[5:05:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> get that sweetness
[5:05:31] <+Solutha> This is a stomping if i ever saw one
[5:05:35] <VritraReiRei> @jiggy_snipe needs 100 CS per 10 minutes for an S-
[5:05:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @KingGrimlock1 "But you didn't do anything"
[5:05:41] <+xddddsorandom> Pat when you have 100 gold left over buy a ward
[5:05:42] <KingGrimlock1> *backs*
[5:05:43] <+xddddsorandom> it's useful
[5:05:43] <+jiggy_snipe> ok cool thx
[5:05:44] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i feel like i'm gonna break a mouse doing it
[5:05:44] <MoonlightP> damn i just noticed the scoreline
[5:05:55] <+Grayhammatter> they only have 5 kills? a stomping
[5:05:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> I don't think warding is doing much for him at this level
