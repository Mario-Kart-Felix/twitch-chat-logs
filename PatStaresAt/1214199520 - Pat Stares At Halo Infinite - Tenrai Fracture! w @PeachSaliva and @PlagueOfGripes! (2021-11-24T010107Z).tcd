[0:24:07] <SocialMisfitGamer> Some hells are precieved to be cold in  certain patheons
[0:24:08] <marvel877> Bluepoint's Sony now, and Eternal Darkness is in Nintendo's hands.
[0:24:08] <cartakus> Hell is a void

[0:24:56] <BarnYardFiddler> That’s only the last level that is cold
[0:24:59] <s1rcuit> I remember Game Grumps making a joke about how hell is being on the subway, and you're anxiously trying to make sure you get your stop
[0:25:00] <%GinAndRoses> my local DMV is also very cool
[0:25:00] <shockmaster3> were you medicated?
[0:25:01] <%Broand> But if Hell is super cold then how come it's called dante's INFERNO
[0:25:02] <$realm_forge> Paige was super drunk
[0:25:05] <+Opal_Overture> Did someone clip Pat's reaction to the TwitchPresents thing?
[0:25:06] <Tracazoid> Paige found the one nice patron of hell
[0:25:08] <samcast1> Pat are you married to a 5 year old?
[0:25:10] <%SWFanatic> I loved it! 10/10 would go again because i have no choice
[0:25:12] <scrumbotime> One of the "hells" in that one city planning game called like, Afterlife, was an Envy hell, where you were in a line to leave hell, but every OTHER line LOOKED faster, but as long as you kept in your line you would get through..... but everyone jumps lines constantly and make no progress.
[0:25:16] <%NovaKnightmare> LUCKY YOU
[0:25:21] <%PrimalDweeb> Have they gotten better when we weren't looking?

[0:47:12] <%NovaKnightmare> because Paige is loud and anxious
[0:47:13] <%Ashrox117> It’s fun AND easy
[0:47:13] <Profmcstevie> It's suuuper easy to bully her
[0:47:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Paige, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, you are doomed to be a hazard to yourself LUL
[0:47:15] <KellBeII> mustard man?
[0:47:16] <@SoFarFetched> Because Pat & Plague have WAY more reciepts and dirt on Paige than she does on Pat & Plague geefPlz

[0:47:25] <+tempestzephyr> it is fun to gang up on Paige sipsipHellmo
[0:47:26] <%SinnerEbru> plague has the right mindset tho
[0:47:26] <+oktavia_von> pagie seems like the type of person to cut themselves badly on a letter opener
[0:47:34] <%maskofmichael> Paige is the only woman in the room, so she must attack herself
[0:47:35] <%Sotetsu> LUL
[0:47:37] <$shanna_become_gamer> I thought this stared with dick crystals
[0:47:40] <JeoDood> ELI Thank U for taking care of her
[0:47:41] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:47:42] <raikagelord1> @r0termond because Paige is literally out to get herself and her Friends/fiancé love her and don’t want her to accidentally self terminate
[0:47:44] <%dekkitout> Together you all make 1.34 a normal person
[0:47:45] <%Bt_Robot> She would just start hanging knives from string, setting small fires, and turning on gas valves, then falling asleep
[0:47:45] <Hyde_01> LUL
[0:47:51] <ZaCrimsonDragon> together they are 50% human

[0:48:09] <%SinnerEbru> ALSO TRUE
[0:48:10] <ilthyf> HOW THE FUCK IS PAIGE ALIVE?
[0:48:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Agreed
[0:48:12] <%Teintstein> paige's oddities permanently damage her
[0:48:15] <KellBeII> all three of you would make the least normal person
[0:48:17] <%Ashrox117> I found out Plague was Eli a week ago
[0:48:17] <+Pleblu> @SaiyanShoto Is he tho?
[0:48:18] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat and Paige together make half of a whole normal person

[1:04:12] <Skatedeandre> i know what hes talking about
[1:04:14] <+EdHeng> i agree plague

[1:04:46] <%RayReborne> me neither
[1:04:50] <Skatedeandre> chloe from life is strange for me
[1:04:56] <KellBeII> shes normal therefore the audience doesnt like her
[1:04:57] <@Lion_kun> S1 Skype was awful
[1:04:59] <sirrice77> Yeah Cohhcarnage just finished SB and while he didn't hate Lyse he was like "everything she does is falling flat"
[1:05:02] <+Opal_Overture> @realm_forge You're awful.

[1:05:03] <%Cactuskris> She dosen´t like crime man
[1:05:03] <cartakus> BECAUSE WAMEN IN THE WAY OF BIG STRONG MAN
[1:05:04] <matsu_me> because they missed the point and viewed walt as the good guy
[1:05:06] <TheotherKristian> Skylar is in fact a compelling character
[1:05:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> I never watched Breaking Bad, is that okay?
[1:05:07] <thebalticguy1> Most people have poor media criticism skills
[1:05:07] <%DianaTheAscian> "LET ME DO CRIME WOMEN"
[1:05:07] <%cephalon_nyt> yeah, I hate her.
[1:05:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SAME
[1:05:12] <+DeRedBaron> i love when people talk about how she growns and blah blah but like she started out not good and maybe grew but still not that great
[1:05:13] <Sunstalker> I fucking hate Kenny from TWD still so fucking much
[1:05:20] <%Cozy90> MALCOM IN THE MIDDLE'S MOM
[1:05:24] <@Lion_kun> S1 Skyler was awful
[1:05:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Walter is waaaaaay worse than Skyler
[1:05:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> A lot of people hate Skylar because she "gets in the way" of Walts woo hoo drug kingpin times
[1:05:29] <peachy996> Peggy Hill isn't the greatest but the show knows she is far from perfect
[1:05:33] <+cermo55> the worse walt gets the better sky gets
[1:05:37] <wantedsafe471> let me pedle drugs women!
[1:05:38] <+capybruhArt> dudes think they're walt
[1:05:44] <T_Sasquatch> Walt makes no sense to me
[1:05:46] <matsu_me> lol
[1:05:46] <%stoatacious> turns out the crystal meth dude is a bad guy!
[1:05:47] <maddogshimano> KENNY BOATMAN FROM TWD SEASON 1
[1:05:49] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah Walt is the bad guy
[1:05:49] <+HolePunchLeaf> protagonist centered sympathy, many people saw Walt as a hero (cause they missed the point of the show)
[1:05:50] <mr_saturday93> Abby from TLOU2
[1:05:51] <%RayReborne> That's the underlying theme of breaking bad, you start to ROOT for Walter, slowly and slowly
[1:05:52] <%doomunderthestairs> haha Marie
[1:05:52] <+D00msDayDan> it's called breaking bad not breaking good
[1:05:53] <%NovaKnightmare> JESUS CHRIST MARIE
[1:05:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Eh, she was still kind of a bitch though. I mean, clearly they needed the money.
[1:05:54] <Dr_Mooose> ehh

[1:05:55] <%brisk_dacat> what about joffrey from GOT
[1:05:58] <atgithursdays> It's funny because they're all terrible!
[1:05:58] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt who was your fav?
[1:05:59] <SunjammerIV> @cephalon_nyt skyler tells walt early on that she would have him thrown in prison if he smoked weed, later she does insurance fraud while moralizing to walt about crimes
[1:06:00] <%s_xylocalsingles> THEYRE MINERALS MARIE MINERALSSSS
[1:06:00] <@Lion_kun> Klepto Marie

[1:06:14] <Sharizord> Isn't umbridge the universally accepted character everyone has enourmous hatred for?
[1:06:16] <Madinki> You mean the colour purple?
[1:06:17] <jorniev> MARIE who!?
[1:06:22] <%captainpodock> I think its partially becaus we become conditioned to like Walt after awhile
[1:06:23] <%NovaKnightmare> Sex gif
[1:06:23] <Sunstalker> Fucking Kenny "WELL GET ON A BOAT, LEE"
[1:06:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Marie was weird
[1:06:25] <%DianaTheAscian> What was the point of Marie's whole stealing thing?
[1:06:35] <%brisk_dacat> Didnt paige say she hated peggy hill
[1:06:43] <wantedsafe471> unbridged, her name is perfect for her attitude
[1:06:45] <WakeUpThrow> ASAC Schrader was pretty rad
[1:06:46] <comicalmond> Skylar is worse
[1:06:55] <Dariustheblackcousin> Superman is inescapble though
[1:06:59] <linSP> reasonable
[1:07:00] <%twistedj3ster> Oh, Cyril from Archer, I can't stand him
[1:07:00] <%NovaKnightmare> some fans hated bobby from king of the hill for some reason
[1:07:00] <peachy996> I think you just want to fuck Superman
[1:07:00] <+cermo55> most hated not suppose to hate character
[1:07:02] <KellBeII> unpopular opinion but i dont much care for season 5 of BB, it has a lot of great scene but on the whole i think its rushed and retreads several character arcs.
[1:07:05] <Skatedeandre> Oh myne from shield hero but you're supposed to hate her
[1:07:05] <%NitronStreams> NitronStreams subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat, I just added an NVME drive to my computer and holy shit are those things small. Even after watching a ton of videos I was not expecting it to actually be the size of a stick of gum.

I personally think Batman is worse than  Superman because Gotham use him as an excuse to not deal with Arkhams inmates in a better way. Batman contributes to the endless cycle of escape and murder his rogue gallery cause.
[1:10:52] <$realm_forge> Cowboy Bebop is the Son of the Mask of Netflix shows
[1:10:53] <%bravebravesrobin> I just st didn't like Vicious
[1:10:56] <+kewlmyc> Cowboy Bebop isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, but I would not call it "well done."

[1:29:42] <%Axellogic> Paige should go blue
[1:29:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They nerfed controller hard
[1:29:47] <Profmcstevie> Halo has been built for controller since it STARTED
[1:29:51] <+RoosterSauces> Orange
[1:29:51] <BigYanno> controller has aim assist
[1:29:53] <%dekkitout> Real gamers play on ddr pads OR guitar hero controllers

[1:29:56] <%blistexthief> Tuned for lean
[1:29:57] <linSP> i just click and people die every time
[1:29:58] <%Cozy90> halo 1 was built for controller
[1:29:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this game makes me irate enough already, I don't need to add right stick aiming to the mix
[1:29:59] <+D00msDayDan> i've lost so many fights due to not being able to turn fast enough in a slapfight, or being too far away for aim assist to kick in with the sidekick or commando
[1:30:03] <wantedsafe471> yeah, playable elites would be nice
[1:30:03] <peachy996> Paige, be purple and name yourselves the Grimace Squad

[1:39:05] <%HotSauceFiend> is there supposed to be music or no?
[1:39:11] <$Order_of_Mystery> fun fact chat and @patstaresat , shoot someone 6 times with the disruptor and it applies a DoT to them!
[1:39:12] <%tusk102> disruptor is DOT and it does AOE damage to allies
[1:39:15] <Talinu> no
[1:39:19] <RickyRelucent> theres a few good ones
[1:39:20] <+HolePunchLeaf> Ravager 🤮
[1:39:23] <RickyRelucent> stalker, commando
[1:39:26] <%twistedj3ster> it's weird how many guns I hate in Halo
[1:39:29] <%dekkitout> Damn that gun was bad
[1:39:35] <%RayReborne> goddamit it IS sonic LUL
[1:39:36] <Vyctorian> if it was like cod, one bullet would hit you and you'd die
[1:39:36] <ToneBacas> movement speed is arbitrarily slow, right?
[1:39:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> KINETIC WEAPONS FOR THE WIN
[1:39:43] <$dashrendar7> I like the Heatwave shooting vertically
[1:39:43] <Bacon_Rage> hit scan weapons? modCheck

[1:39:45] <+R0bobot> brute guns fuck
[1:39:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt shoot someone 6 times with the disruptor and it applies an AOE DOT effect to them
[1:39:54] <ScreamLord> Skewer is good
[1:39:57] <marvel877> Just the needler and plasma pistol are any good.
[1:39:57] <theanora1> Eli needs a Warframe Tonkor
[1:39:59] <%Logoth_> Energy carbine is only good for disabling vehicles
[1:39:59] <+R0bobot> lead your shots lol
[1:39:59] <+jude_knight> Mangler is fun
[1:39:59] <%optimasmaximas> heat wave is GREAT f un
[1:39:59] <Talinu> @ToneBacas No that's just how Halo is.
[1:40:00] <%Valdorick> Kinetic Weapons being hitscan or near hitscan help
[1:40:01] <RickyRelucent> the mangler is kinda eh but it shoots fast
[1:40:05] <+D00msDayDan> @ToneBacas what do you mean arbitrarily? the movement speed is the movement speed
[1:40:05] <+razielhex> oooh man I've never seen Halo Multiplayer outside of Blood Gulch like 20 years ago; are players just ragdolling?
[1:40:06] <thebalticguy1> WOW YOU SUCKJ
[1:40:07] <Vyctorian> @tusk102 3-4 times

[1:40:09] <GojiGoro> just eating ravager shots
[1:40:10] <jbrachob> HAMMER TIME
[1:40:13] <+pupil31> monkaS
[1:40:17] <Arqartur0> So, I've been enjoying Halo multiplayer right now (halo infinite), but... some textures or part of the wall... Or parts of me/other players are invisible... other than that, it seems fine, do I need to finagle some settings?
[1:40:17] <$dashrendar7> How have they never made a needler shotgun?
[1:40:18] <Dr_Mooose> excuse me?
[1:40:18] <%SWFanatic> dicks out

[1:40:42] <wantedsafe471> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:40:46] <RickyRelucent> @tusk102 banished weapons get more melee dmg
[1:40:49] <primaryfire> I spent like 30 minutes with the plasma carbine weapon drill, trying to 3 star it, before I realised the projectiles are homing
[1:40:50] <RickyRelucent> :3
[1:40:52] <+R0bobot> bungler
[1:40:53] <ToneBacas> @doomunderthestairs I mean deliberately slow -- it looks very slow in my opinion
[1:40:55] <+razielhex> Andres is just owning Pat
[1:40:57] <Vyctorian> The alien guns are all skill based weapons, except the ravenger that's just bad
[1:41:10] <+jude_knight> I miss it too
[1:41:11] <+R0bobot> oh yeah mr krabs
[1:41:12] <+D00msDayDan> GAMER
[1:41:16] <RickyRelucent> arc cannon can be one shot if u land a whole burst, like the BR
[1:41:19] <GojiGoro> the pistol actual beats the shotgun at close range

[1:49:55] <slix3431> I thought Plague only liked smart games for smart kids
[1:49:56] <+D00msDayDan> cindershot also pulls you in or bounces you away depending on if you hipfire or zoom in

[1:59:49] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Every challenge you complete for the event just straight up gives you a full tier
[1:59:49] <jorniev> HOW IS THIS A BETA?
[1:59:55] <5paceIoser> maybe put coatings that AREN'T ugly asf into the battle pass

[2:00:13] <+RyanTheRecluse> I feel like they could assign xp values to the medals you receive in a match, it'd be a good versions of performance based xp
[2:00:18] <xxshadowxx416> btb

[2:17:59] <$realm_forge> Pat’s mangler boner is audible
[2:18:01] <+D00msDayDan> since there aren't any map pickups there's no longer any concept of map control, you can just huddle in a corner and kill the enemy team as they come to you and take their guns

[2:18:34] <jorniev> pat be carefull with coom god
[2:18:36] <%ChocolateMoofin> It's possible the higher variance of weapons add slightly higher time to kill across the board. the worse team may be waiting to spawn more than usual
[2:18:37] <GojiGoro> pistol is actually great in this game and i love it

[3:09:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Co-op campaign out in May...
[3:09:26] <%RetroCop87> Eli grumpy that no one's listening to his tsun tsuning
[3:09:31] <%dekkitout> Wasn't there a coop campaign kerfuffle?
[3:09:34] <%Agami23> isnt the coop campaign delayed and only solo campaign will be available for a while?
[3:09:39] <linSP> how full of poo is gief
[3:09:40] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Coop got delayed again.
[3:09:55] <+orochiblood> the progression systems and the store completely turned me off this game tbh.
[3:09:56] <%FunkyStreams> whatever we killed more native americans than you fucks

[3:10:59] <%Artoo__The_Me> psaDogchamp
[3:11:11] <+ScrapKingKeita> wait, Viktor is an ADC now???
[3:11:16] <%blastyoboots> Arcane Act 1 has such boring writing I couldn't stand it D:
[3:11:19] <%blastyoboots> but I"lll keep going
[3:11:21] <%TheWinged7> whut
[3:11:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Like Xenoblade Torna
[3:11:50] <Maleicus> Hohn Jalo
[3:12:00] <+D00msDayDan> man i can't wait to watch the halo tv show it's gonna be a trash fire
[3:12:06] <ralphfromdk> That's... not far of from what happens LUL
[3:12:14] <%JoshManVGH> She made an oopsie and discovered drugs
[3:12:18] <%RayReborne> man lotta purple peeps
[3:12:22] <+cermo55> not quite, but also not entirely no
[3:12:25] <%RealThiele> LOVES the crack
[3:12:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Maleicus That sounds like a Star Wars character
[3:12:28] <cartakus> Are there ANY monster characters in arcane?
[3:12:28] <%TheWinged7> 3 purple bois and redman
[3:12:34] <mr_saturday93> purple squad
[3:12:46] <Arqartur0> strangely enough, Jinx precedes the Joker in most modern movies, so psycho Jinx is not based ON the Joker, which I thought it was.
[3:13:01] <ZawaAmaz> the misunderstanding as Powder's start of darkness was really lame
[3:13:04] <%Tman451> its after you fire a shot
[3:13:24] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean the game?
[3:13:26] <moonwraithdruckmann> is this game as bad as people are saying?
[3:13:30] <jorniev> COCAINE AND MENTAL ILLNES is basically what jinx is about
[3:13:31] <%KineticZen> Arcane is very good, but Midnight Mass is great
[3:13:39] <%ospreyworks> gotta go put a 17lb turkey in some brine
[3:13:43] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is kinda brutal on new players
[3:13:44] <+Ropcord> @moonwraithdruckmann the game is great it just has some f2p issues
[3:13:49] <jorniev> JUST add explosives
[3:13:50] <joodatious> @moonwraithdruckmann nah its actually really fun but the progression sucks for now
[3:13:50] <Arqartur0> @ZawaAmaz I think when she was crying in her room was the start of   it
[3:13:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> @moonwraithdruckmann game's good, battlepass bad
[3:13:57] <TimetodiveLTX> that are some good chiptunes in that arcade
[3:14:00] <%AncelDeLambert> this game explains NOTHING beyond basic movement and shooting in the tutorial
[3:14:02] <moonwraithdruckmann> arcane set a gold standard for videogame adaptations i honestly dont think anything else is going to match up to it
[3:14:03] <+D00msDayDan> perrrrfect
[3:14:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I had no clue what the repulsor even did until someone pushed me out of the arena
[3:14:24] <TheHeroAppears> they do have extra players wtf
[3:14:27] <moonwraithdruckmann> @Ropcord ahh gotcha, so should i wait for a few patches before buying it?
[3:14:39] <%juxtest> dont you lose to that bot
[3:14:40] <+Ropcord> the MP is free
[3:14:42] <Foymic> pop
[3:14:44] <Arqartur0> @moonwraithdruckmann the thing is, LoL had a semi-blank slate on the characters, so to add the meta-plot was easy
[3:14:47] <%AncelDeLambert> sometimes you dash when you melee but it's not all the time why fuck if I know the game won't tell me
[3:14:48] <+Ropcord> the campaign won't be out until next month
[3:14:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @TheHeroAppears nah, people that dc stay on the scoreboard
[3:15:04] <moonwraithdruckmann> @Ropcord oh right i keep forgetting the single player is in december lol
[3:15:33] <Arqartur0> I hate rocket jumps
[3:15:47] <joodatious> how does that not kill pat. when i use the spanker 10 feet away i always die
[3:15:53] <Arqartur0> because I can never do them
[3:16:11] <moonwraithdruckmann> @Arqartur0 thats true, you got a point there, they were able to be more creative with it for sure, rather than relying on the source material, but goddamn was it a masterpiece, probably the best animated show we've ever seen in our lifetime so far
[3:16:23] <%FunkyStreams> what even is that fuckin gun?
[3:16:28] <%JoshManVGH> It bounces, it kinda sucks
[3:16:39] <$realm_forge> Nah it sucks not you
[3:16:52] <%JoshManVGH> No Pat, ALWAYS blame the weapon
[3:16:59] <TimetodiveLTX> nice
[3:17:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> nice trade
[3:17:06] <Arqartur0> @moonwraithdruckmann Well... video game animation maybe... Avatar: the last Airbender is still good.
[3:17:10] <+TigglesWorth> if you keep holding after shooting you can guide the grenades
[3:17:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[3:17:13] <+DBTenno> Mutual kill best kill
[3:17:28] <+DBTenno> lol it's him again
[3:17:50] <+max_radical> pat killed that bot so hard he faded from reality
[3:17:53] <%FunkyStreams> but despite that tho
[3:18:05] <Arqartur0> @moonwraithdruckmann but Arcane is indeed very good, and it's gonna be rough to surpass it in a while (also Castlevania).
[3:18:10] <jorniev> what!?
[3:18:10] <TimetodiveLTX> oh fuck i hear it
[3:18:11] <%RayReborne> the Mic??!?

[3:18:29] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[3:18:30] <moonwraithdruckmann> @Arqartur0 yeah i love avatar too but arcane jsut hits different for me personally, might be recency bias but idk im gonna obsess over this for a loong time, just the animation style itself is gonna be studied for years to come a lot of companies are gonna want to imitate it for sure
[3:18:33] <%RayReborne> NOT MY EAR AJHHHHH
[3:18:39] <%RayReborne> PAT NO LUL
[3:18:47] <%twistedj3ster> I guess I look like a Doberman's dick

[3:20:58] <Ranger747> LUL
[3:20:59] <%MidnightBurst12> D:
[3:21:03] <+TheOddJik> But Pat have you watched Stargate: Universe?
[3:21:09] <badguy8312> the theme of OG Naruto was exactly that tho
[3:21:11] <$realm_forge> Fuck Sakura
[3:21:13] <Arqartur0> I only watched two episodes of Naruto, and that was it
[3:21:17] <+DBTenno> Naruto had a few nice theme songs :P
[3:21:23] <%NopeBadguy> YOUR DEVILISH WILES
[3:21:32] <Madinki> @PatStaresAt Ban the words "have you seen"
[3:21:33] <%blastyoboots> I've read ALL OF NARUTO and watched half of it, and I still believed Plague when he said that was the theme
[3:21:48] <$realm_forge> Sakura is the Peggy Hill of anime
[3:21:51] <%JoshManVGH> World Biggest Halo Clown! Gottem
[3:22:04] <%juxtest> Pat have you heard of this new innovation called Television?
[3:22:10] <%twistedj3ster> Recharge is that for me
[3:22:11] <%greasypete00> basically the consensus for this game that ive seen so far is that if you like shooters or halo or both you like this game a lot and otherwise most people ive seen play it have just put it down
[3:22:13] <badguy8312> how dare you talk down on Peggy like that, she was a Boggle Champion
[3:22:16] <%Chichen> halo is a moba now
[3:22:18] <+TheSaintJohn> Titanfall 2 had the 3 lane problem as well
[3:22:20] <%mostbrokenrobo> Pat: The maps are alright.  Also Pat: FUCK THIS MAP
[3:22:21] <+max_radical> 3 lane map design is good and people only dont like it because a youtuber said 3 lanes bad at one point i bet
[3:22:31] <BurdRightsActivist> Stupid fucking snowbound
[3:22:31] <+max_radical> modern warfare tried to not do 3 lanes and it was fucking garbage
[3:22:36] <%FunkyStreams> SLAP
[3:22:38] <%JoshManVGH> Behemoth is the only one I'm not a fan of. Like, I get why it's there, but I like the tighter maps.
[3:22:46] <Arqartur0> three lane maps is basically LoL and Dota
[3:22:48] <%FunkyStreams> DOUBLE SLAP
[3:23:04] <@Ranryu692> blood gulch was great
[3:23:09] <Dr_Mooose> it was simple fun map
[3:23:13] <+max_radical> @Arqartur0 3 lanes has been a thing long before dota or lol were a thing
[3:23:16] <%RayReborne> HE DID IT
[3:23:16] <%Tman451> Its an iconic map, but its not a very good one, just like CTF Face in UT
[3:23:18] <RickyRelucent> i liked prison
[3:23:18] <badguy8312> blood gulch was the video game version of a water cooler and a sandbox fucking
[3:23:18] <+RyanTheRecluse> it's a fun map
[3:23:19] <$realm_forge> Who are these freaks that have the armor already?!
[3:23:21] <%RayReborne> HE WON
[3:23:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's mostly just a field with hills
[3:23:38] <+NicDanger> Pat thats the Red vs Blue map
[3:23:41] <Vyctorian> incorrectly is the best way to play, games are toys (art but still toys)
[3:23:43] <+extradopeness> its mostly good for running people over around the flag base
[3:23:54] <%JoshManVGH> Boooo
[3:23:59] <badguy8312> I only asked because Pat specifically advertised for Arcane lmao
[3:23:59] <+max_radical> @Vyctorian chad take
[3:24:03] <+D00msDayDan> i saw people wearing the armor within an hour of the event starting
[3:24:07] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[3:24:11] <%mostbrokenrobo> LUL
[3:24:23] <%Deadpal> LUL
[3:24:27] <Vyctorian> @Vyctorian Thanks~
[3:24:29] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[3:24:29] <Profmcstevie> You need some better batteries or something, get some recommendations
[3:24:32] <%Deadpal> I'm clipping that
[3:24:34] <Xelhesia> LUL
[3:24:34] <%Deadpal> that was really good.
[3:24:35] <augustustamerlane> It really didn’t take that long to get. You just got to do the what? 5 weeklies?
[3:24:44] <$realm_forge> Crazy talk
[3:24:44] <%castlerock42> Man, Crazy Talk is working for good for once.
[3:24:45] <+tempestzephyr> the power of pat stand
[3:24:52] <+extradopeness> psaHoldon
[3:25:09] <%doomunderthestairs> psaCrazyhead
[3:25:12] <%FunkyStreams> seems futuristic
[3:25:20] <Vyctorian> All the electric guns are OP
[3:25:22] <+max_radical> after a solid day or two of learning the maps, spawns and gameplay you can get challenges down to a science pretty quick, unless theyre 100% rng based
[3:25:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> It EMPs vehicles real good
[3:25:31] <RickyRelucent> thats because its also emp and does aoe
[3:25:39] <+durt_mcguirk> they kill shield and add a dot
[3:25:43] <RickyRelucent> full burst to the head should kill em
[3:25:50] <%JoshManVGH> How does one be OP with the Shock Rifle?
[3:25:52] <badguy8312> the disruptor is used by non federation groups like the Cardassians and Romulans
[3:25:53] <+applegreen92> if 2 enemies stand next to each other both get hurt if you shoot it with that electricity gun. The same happens if you shoot weapons on the ground next to people
[3:25:59] <augustustamerlane> But that Yokai helmet looks dope as hell. Too bad progression still sucks.
[3:26:07] <%Agami23> i kind of just wish the game had the normal halo weapons. but the old halos exist so i guess i shouldent complain
[3:26:30] <Zombrocom> Shock rifle is a one shot kill on headshot, it's super good
[3:26:47] <Zombrocom> Best non-power weapon in the game imo
[3:26:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> gimme swat
[3:26:50] <badguy8312> just make Halo 3 2 already geez!
[3:26:52] <+Freakin_Wolfy> is pat decent at halo??????
[3:26:52] <RickyRelucent> swat
[3:26:57] <+extradopeness> SWAT must return
[3:26:57] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I feel like that shouldn't be the case
[3:27:04] <DSD24> Yeah that's boring
[3:27:07] <+max_radical> @Zombrocom shhh people havent figured it out yet for the most part so they still think its bad and dont take all my shock rifle spawns LUL
[3:27:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> commando swat would be hype af
[3:27:08] <@Ranryu692> since when?
[3:27:10] <%Agami23> kinda just makes me want to play old halo
[3:27:12] <DSD24> Objective is fun
[3:27:13] <+bigslinglelino> Can't believe they launched a Halo game without infected
[3:27:17] <BurdRightsActivist> slayer fuckin sucks tbh
[3:27:22] <%RayReborne> slayers nice and all but objective is more interestinf
[3:27:27] <graemecrackers2> FUCKING SLAYER
[3:27:29] <%juxtest> Fiesta is a staple it cant leave thats BS
[3:27:32] <RickyRelucent> i played alot of FFA on reach, when u could still join with your friends
[3:27:39] <zashrin777> really hoping for firefight too. firefight is great
[3:27:41] <Zombrocom> Now the ravager, that thing is TRASH
[3:27:49] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @BurdRightsActivist slayer is the only gametype where your teammates can't royally screw things up constantly by never playing the obj
[3:27:53] <badguy8312> wait what determines his load out on respawn?
[3:27:59] <RickyRelucent> me and one friend would always share to two spots
[3:28:05] <+max_radical> @RayReborne i agree but ifeel in most objective matches the other team is seal team six on the objective and my team is just goofin around, its always a stomp
[3:28:08] <+D00msDayDan> @Freakin_Wolfy except for slayer's objective, don't die
[3:28:11] <RickyRelucent> top two*
[3:28:17] <DeathByPoke7> ravager is butt
[3:28:28] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @D00msDayDan true, but there's an upper limit to how fast they can die
[3:28:30] <%Agami23> objective is fine if its just an option, because the people who dont want to play objective can just play slayer when slayer exists. instead of playing objective badly
[3:28:31] <+RyanTheRecluse> pulse carbine got a nerf
[3:28:40] <$realm_forge> Pulled a real Bungie with that one
[3:28:51] <+bigslinglelino> Commando is just weird balance-wise because Im not sure what role its supposed to fill
[3:29:03] <badguy8312> BR go BR
[3:29:08] <%Valdorick> The Commando feels like the gun you should spawn with, and then you upgrade to the Assault Rifle.
[3:29:14] <DSD24> @Agami23 Exactly its a bummer when people don't play the objective because they just want to play Slayer
[3:29:30] <%FunkyStreams> not sure why they removed the bubble shield
[3:29:32] <RickyRelucent> its one way btw
[3:29:36] <RickyRelucent> ez win in a 1v1
[3:29:50] <Profmcstevie> Placable shield is very map abd objective dependant
[3:30:00] <ralphfromdk> Didn't have Paige to carry you LUL
[3:30:04] <badguy8312> @funkystreams only bubble they need is in the Spartan's booty
[3:30:06] <RickyRelucent> bubble shield needs to come back as a power weapon
[3:30:06] <+extradopeness> looks like peaches was carrying you guys
[3:30:11] <RickyRelucent> atleast
[3:30:11] <+max_radical> bubble shield is really strong, i feel in the current era of gaming itd be much harder to deal with
[3:30:21] <%Valdorick> Plague never has fun.
[3:30:25] <%RetroCop87> baby Eli lying cuz he's embawassed
[3:30:43] <BurdRightsActivist> KappaPride
[3:30:55] <+Kingtut9009> The progression of the game is pretty damn awful, but it's fun to play at least
[3:31:05] <%maskofmichael> @RetroCop87 More like Big Brother Eli lying to Baby Pat
[3:31:16] <%RayReborne> @max_radical i mean when people actually play the objective, yeah it's great
[3:31:20] <wiDOPANos> no people will bot
[3:31:32] <RickyRelucent> i think its supposed to be like, do the challanges
[3:31:33] <+D00msDayDan> it's incredible how quickly halo lost all its momentum coming off of cod vanguard and bf2042 being trash, now my friends are saying time to go back to bf1 and codmw
[3:31:33] <%RayReborne> fuck the challenges, play the damn game how about that game devs Kappa
[3:31:42] <RickyRelucent> and many pl might not do the ones they have
