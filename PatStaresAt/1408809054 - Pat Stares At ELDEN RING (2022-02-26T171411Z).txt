[0:20:38] <mrcelab> Wait, didnt you chose to go from the side? You can choose multiple times?
[0:20:42] <%RayReborne> Hey chat, have any of you found a staff for regular magics yet? I'm not restarting the game just for a sceptre lol

[0:20:51] <%Axellogic> This isnt new at all PAt
[0:21:11] <Aussie_Manny> people put messages in funny places
[0:21:11] <Yeshua73> Can’t express enough that I couldn’t even get this game to launch because of the anti cheat
[0:21:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @rayreborne the vendor doesnt even sell it but I'll keep an eye out
[0:21:24] <%Axellogic> Yep it was in the network test I used that room
[0:21:26] <mrcelab> the guys armor
[0:21:27] <MaritimeSpanker> what does it say
[0:21:38] <%bundle_of_herbs> lore?
[0:21:51] <%Axellogic> I remember it cause I thought it was funny theres 4 graces like 5 feets from each other
[0:21:56] <%Brassnarwhal> Does anyone remember where pat got his finger seal?
[0:22:02] <mrcelab> self shackle? ok
[0:22:04] <%PartyFavors> Huh, it DOES buff faith

[0:22:14] <+xcompleasedad> Crazy Talk ain't even waiting
[0:22:21] <+CelioHogane> You are right pat, they can totally not shoot you anymore.
[0:22:21] <%bundle_of_herbs> oh so it's some blasphemous shit
[0:22:22] <%VivalaDragoon> Increases faith?

[0:23:08] <%RayReborne> @brassnarwhal thanks my guy
[0:23:09] <%jamsbybetty> the fact that you can guard counter arrows n shit is hilarious to me

[0:23:21] <SwordsHaver> *crone voice* be warned wretched pat of the vile eelhound of shitsburg, it seeks to twist your balls clean off, eeehehahahee!
[0:23:36] <%Axellogic> I wish poise let me guard counter through shit
[0:23:41] <%RayReborne> @brassnarwhal also Pat started with his a finger seal since he chose one of the Faith classes
[0:23:45] <+CelioHogane> My gamer instincts tell me to jump on top of the boxes, but then this is dark souls, wich means the boxes are made of paper.
[0:23:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @jamsbybetty I've used it to power attack groups using the arrow
[0:24:13] <%jamsbybetty> @Brassnarwhal LUL LUL LUL

[0:26:01] <%Axellogic> They dont have health bars anymore for some rason
[0:26:02] <Aussie_Manny> They respawn? Fuck.
[0:26:04] <+yooniversal> i've never seen them remount them though
[0:26:10] <$KishinGrek> of all the SoulsBorne bosses, none of them really disturbed me, but for some reason I REALLY hated the watchdog boss, the looked so weird my brain couldn't handle it
[0:26:12] <%holydeviant1> At least they all have the same weakness
[0:26:21] <+CelioHogane> he trully has the high ground
[0:26:22] <Aussie_Manny> OPTIC BLAST
[0:26:26] <woodstocktwitch> @sniffy77 Did you hug the woman in the place? if so you need to use her buff to get rid of the debuff

[0:26:54] <%slandracon> Geal?
[0:26:55] <mrcelab> How much damage does the bow/crossbow do?
[0:26:57] <NashvilleSBA> fashion ring

[0:28:02] <Aussie_Manny> @Axellogic Fire indeed hot.
[0:28:05] <mrcelab> @mrcelab But is it fast to change the weapon? I mean instead of using the spell.
[0:28:16] <Aussie_Manny> God, I love how anime these spells are.

[0:28:31] <%Brassnarwhal> i carry crepus' crossbow cause it has long range, i use it to pull agro it's helpful against the knife birds with the barrels cause it breaks the barrels

[0:29:32] <luciluxlu0> why didn't you use olef?
[0:29:37] <Aussie_Manny> Mufasaaaaa
[0:29:39] <%Axellogic> I do wish moves tracked less
[0:29:43] <LiterallyPerfect> is this basically just another dark souls game ?
[0:29:54] <+CelioHogane> @LiterallyPerfect yes
[0:30:00] <%Brassnarwhal> @axellogic they lowkey out here dark souls 2ing us
[0:30:00] <Ramseyyyy96> maybe
[0:30:03] <LiterallyPerfect> @celiohogane boring
[0:30:06] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaGiefrail 🔪
[0:30:08] <%Axellogic> You can lure the dog man into the ballistas to have them do it for you
[0:30:09] <%holydeviant1> @LiterallyPerfect imagine if all three dark souls games were one game, with all the best prts of each, and a new setting
[0:30:12] <Aussie_Manny> Damn respawning ballistas.
[0:30:13] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt The crossbows stay the same if you break them i guess
[0:30:25] <LiterallyPerfect> lame im out
[0:30:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @holydeviant1 plus some sekiro
[0:30:39] <%holydeviant1> You did break one before...
[0:30:41] <+xcompleasedad> Go check
[0:30:46] <%holydeviant1> So check that one?
[0:30:47] <Ramseyyyy96> owned
[0:30:48] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> @aussie_manny The ballistas are undead.
[0:30:57] <Kale_Chip> it was back
[0:31:10] <+doe3879> anyone know if a PS button prompt mod exist for PC yet?
[0:31:18] <%MartinOfLoxley> !uptime
[0:31:19] <@Moobot> @MartinOfLoxley I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 31m 28s.
[0:31:25] <Aussie_Manny> They practice ballista-mancy.
[0:31:27] <+johnny_scissors> Anyone have this crash a PS5? had it happen twice so far
[0:31:30] <MaritimeSpanker> Weird choice to have them be destrucable, yet still come back
[0:31:48] <%Brassnarwhal> i seem to survive on a magic pixel a lot of the time, do you think the game has some sort of mercy thing implemented? or am i just crazy lucky
[0:31:54] <Aussie_Manny> @johnny_scissors Randomly? Or did you repeat a certain situation to get it?
[0:32:03] <%za7az> @johnny_scissors No crashes on mine
[0:32:09] <+Ancisace> Might be some weird coding thing. It's easier to make them interactable if they're destructible or something
[0:32:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @maritimespanker especially considering how hard they are to actually break
[0:32:16] <mrcelab> but he wants to
[0:32:17] <+CelioHogane> He disagrees with that statement
[0:32:22] <%jamsbybetty> those ballistas must be made from the same kinda wood as the furniture in roundtable >_>
[0:32:23] <+johnny_scissors> @aussie_manny Once when starting then again trying to summon in one of the catacombs for a boss
[0:32:30] <%YakumoYomi> @doe3879 Not that I've seen. Most of the "mods" I've seen are ReShade presets
[0:32:46] <%LorcaNomad> yo that lion design is so cool tho
[0:32:46] <NashvilleSBA> you got them
[0:32:51] <razieltano123> Can you find a new Sites of Grace close to the castle?
[0:32:51] <An_Ordinary_Fox> You got them
[0:32:55] <MaritimeSpanker> @Brassnarwhal Maybe its a bug, and they're meant to be able to remain broken?
[0:33:07] <%Axellogic> Ive not seen any illusion walls yet
[0:33:09] <MaritimeSpanker> Good jerb, pat!
[0:33:09] <convo445> so the stutter problem is a shader compilation thing. Same thing you joked about with KOF15 on the podcast
[0:33:11] <razieltano123> Kill the cat
[0:33:18] <%luftraumm1> the worst thing is you HAVEto try all these fake hidden walls
[0:33:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @maritimespanker the one at fort haight stayed broken but the enemies didnt respawn either
[0:33:27] <%holydeviant1> Where is Stormviel? General map ddirection, I can't seem to ffind it.
[0:33:46] <mrcelab> lightning boss incoming?
[0:33:48] <MaritimeSpanker> huh
[0:33:52] <%Brassnarwhal> the orange green is kinda hideous imo
[0:33:52] <+johnny_scissors> @holydeviant1 north, where the first sites of grace are pointing you to
[0:33:53] <Aussie_Manny> @johnny_scissors Ohh, so entirely different instances for both crashes? That sucks. It's a new game. All we can do is report crashes, and send them the video/data so they fix it soon.
[0:33:54] <%Wynzler> @holydeviant1 northwest of Church of Elleh
[0:34:04] <%holydeviant1> thanks
[0:34:06] <%Wynzler> North by north-west, rather
[0:34:07] <%Axellogic> I do like that the game has bg music now though I wish it was more melodic sometimes
[0:34:08] <%cade_calrayn> OH
[0:34:09] <%Brassnarwhal> @holydeviant1 north past the church of elleh
[0:34:18] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Not fucken wimdy
[0:34:23] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Bro summon!!!!
[0:34:25] <Aussie_Manny> Shadow of the Fairly Large But Not That Large Colossus

[0:34:33] <@TheYellowcouch> love these dudes
[0:34:39] <%Wynzler> I'm 12 hours in and still can't find another Dex based weapon that isn't "quality"
[0:34:41] <MaritimeSpanker> these dudes are so cool
[0:34:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> Can you summon Oleg?
[0:34:45] <%Axellogic> Can you horse now?
[0:34:48] <Aussie_Manny> uhoh.
[0:34:48] <MaritimeSpanker> YO
[0:34:51] <convo445> at least biting their ankle isn't too hard
[0:34:51] <MaritimeSpanker> HE HAS A BIG BOW
[0:34:55] <%holydeviant1> I love how some enemies re so HUGE that getting to the riposte weak point can be a challenge
[0:34:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @luftraumm1 New boss or Golem again? Golem again.
[0:34:57] <%YakumoYomi> Oh boy...one has a giant bow
[0:34:59] <+yooniversal> yay friendly fire
[0:35:00] <%SABiscotti> BIG ARCHER

[0:36:23] <chowndawg> ghost tree
[0:36:23] <+Ancisace> Trees confirmed for government hoax
[0:36:24] <%BackflipCharm> Ghost of the tree
[0:36:27] <%bundle_of_herbs> the music kinda reminds me of the one the nomadic merchant was playing??
[0:36:30] <%Brassnarwhal> He's no Gough
[0:36:30] <seer0ftime> big boy
[0:36:31] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It's honest. That's why.
[0:36:31] <@TheYellowcouch> it's treensparent
[0:36:37] <%LorcaNomad> I think that's the fog
[0:36:38] <Aussie_Manny> i'm imaging the big guy complaining in a big, slow voice "sstooopp mmooovviiinngg pleeeaaase"

[0:36:55] <%LorcaNomad> WAIT IT IS TRANSPARENT
[0:36:55] <chowndawg> the talisman you got yesterday seem to imply the erd tree was dying maybe?
[0:37:01] <TheAntiNihilist> because you haven't got that far into the map yet
[0:37:02] <+beavnation> i would love a bow the size of a truck
[0:37:03] <+CelioHogane> Watch it be the tree is fake.
[0:37:09] <jubejube56> The age of tree must be dying
[0:37:14] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, it's the Bifrost?
[0:37:19] <%Wynzler> The erdtree is definitely dying
[0:37:19] <MaritimeFox> The tree is a hologram, just like Tuupac.
[0:37:25] <ape_hawk> the tree is just astral projecting
[0:37:27] <%cade_calrayn> Pretty bad?
[0:37:28] <MaritimeSpanker> Wouldn't be the first time in the series that something big was an illsuion
[0:37:30] <%Wynzler> I think that's what scarletrot is
[0:37:31] <%Wyrmspirit> the tree is transparent because george r.r. martin never finished writing about it
[0:37:32] <Necnill> dmc5 patch looks rad
[0:37:32] <Aussie_Manny> Heimdall! I need a lift!

[0:37:41] <%king_wragles> The tree is healing light confirmed
[0:37:44] <MaritimeSpanker> look for grace, yeah

[0:53:42] <%Brassnarwhal> yes you can
[0:53:48] <Aussie_Manny> I love speedruns in Souls games.
[0:53:49] <+Akizea> @TheYellowcouch that is not storm stomp
[0:53:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think there was a path to take to get that one item.
[0:53:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> backstep onto a turtle 300 times to warp into the final boss arena instantly
[0:53:56] <%Wynzler> there are so many miyazaki-isms in this castle
[0:53:57] <%Axellogic> The side path in the castle IS SO LONG compared to the front door
[0:54:00] <%Dakuu75> FUCK DUDE!, some giant ass-hole on a horse almost hit one of my merchant NPC. shit
[0:54:04] <coziestbank> All boss speedruns are gonna be so complicated.
[0:54:09] <MaritimeSpanker> I wonder if there's a Storm Ruler in this game too
[0:54:12] <+doe3879> heavy armour and great sword with quick step seem fun
[0:54:12] <Tenebrae94> your lantern pat
[0:54:14] <Aussie_Manny> Now, back to the airbending knight.

[0:56:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> @theblackbreath it happens every now and again, but it's intermittent
[0:56:31] <Aussie_Manny> jeez
[0:56:33] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is that Demon's Souls?
[0:56:34] <AllenDeadman> I just discovered a whole new part of the castle just now
[0:56:34] <MaritimeSpanker> Does it have a Fat official to go with it, too?
[0:56:44] <+elcolossomascarado> @theblackbreath Borderless Windowed fixes most of that, apparentely
[0:56:44] <%The_Switchback> These dungeons look fuckin' m a s s i v e i'm excited to get into it today
[0:56:45] <%jamsbybetty> @theblackbreath just a bit when I go fast across the map but other than that fairly stable

[1:14:53] <digaogrunge> Thats all that dude says?
[1:14:55] <modsformeandyou> Pat, how high is your brightness? Any higher than 5 will make the game look really washed out.
[1:14:58] <+dom3800> don't bother
[1:14:59] <+fauxfeels> he moves to the table after godrick
[1:15:01] <+dom3800> he leaves

[1:16:11] <lucasnunez90> You stopped using summons today ;)
[1:16:18] <%cade_calrayn> become as birb
[1:16:24] <%cade_calrayn> @lucasnunez90 they're disabled in this zone
[1:16:26] <skagtheprinceofhell> @senfood What is with this game and birds*
[1:16:30] <skagtheprinceofhell> Terrible is implied
[1:16:31] <xxHungryxx> Chat, could you defeat a blade bird?
[1:16:32] <King_Kth> What the hell these birds are sick, whoever decided to give birds sowrds deserves a raise
[1:16:38] <+dom3800> guard counter seems very strong. Kinda regret going dex
[1:16:43] <%PartyFavors> @xxHungryxx not a chance
[1:16:46] <King_Kth> "Yknow what would make this bird cool? Swords"
[1:16:49] <lucasnunez90> @cade_calrayn Aaah, explains everything
[1:16:50] <oda_flobunaga> those aren't even the bad birds LUL
[1:16:58] <%Bloomingzonda> I hope we get some DS2 ballsack men in this game
[1:17:02] <XxMoliciousxX> you can to say castle in the most monocle wearing english accent
[1:17:03] <modsformeandyou> How would Pat rate the game as of right now?
[1:17:04] <skagtheprinceofhell> @xxHungryxx How small is the bird?
[1:17:12] <%NopeBadguy> What sword is that?
[1:17:12] <%shootbang_exe> I haven't figured out guard counter yet -_-
[1:17:31] <%cade_calrayn> Oh, you know what I just realized? That knight is probably using an Ashes of War himself
[1:17:45] <+ArtemisCroc> he is, yes
[1:17:47] <modsformeandyou> Pat, what's your rating of the game as of right now?
[1:17:48] <sirrice77> @shootbang_exe block and right after you block a hit then press r2
[1:17:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Honestly I'm worried about messing up my character
[1:18:02] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah this is a 10 for me too
[1:18:03] <ape_hawk> 10 out of what?
[1:18:12] <xxHungryxx> @skagtheprinceofhell we watching the same stream right?
[1:18:12] <%AnthroMetal> yup, agreed
[1:18:15] <notmilician> Maybe off topic, but is there a quick button for summoning Torrent? Hate having to switch off my flask or hold Y/A and press a direction for it. Wish you could just hold down a button to bring him out.
[1:18:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 10/5
[1:18:19] <deviljhojho_> it looks really good
[1:18:19] <%AnthroMetal> it's incredible
[1:18:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt have you found any more of those teleport chests?
[1:18:26] <+bustawof> You dont need to worry because you can respec
[1:18:28] <Omenaire_> this game set the bar
[1:18:32] <mrcelab> but 10 out of 10? how much?
[1:18:34] <$Smokay17> Considering this is more filled out, I think this is much better than BOTW.
[1:18:38] <%LorcaNomad> but without weapon durability which makes it better
[1:18:38] <+abrupt_abe> And that Horizon got fucked by the release
[1:18:45] <%RaziWraith> What if I didn't like BoTW though?
[1:18:50] <%Crookedspiral> conquer the chest high wall
[1:18:53] <$realm_forge> Anyone know where I can get some decent reference for the weapons? I really want to make some of them
[1:18:57] <+eanscrale> It helps that ashes of war don't have durability
[1:18:59] <TheAntiNihilist> ?? there's no comparison. breath of the wild had pretty much no good boss fights
[1:19:00] <King_Kth> Are there any mimics in this game?
[1:19:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think you have a full Exiled Set.
[1:19:00] <%gitgouda> have you fallen down a pit yet?
[1:19:04] <XxMoliciousxX> 10+ bad ass seal of approval?
[1:19:07] <%mongorific> not all the trap chests end up being bad like the first
[1:19:10] <mrcelab> ladder
[1:19:12] <deviljhojho_> this make sme really excited for new Horizon games because it means they are harbingers for once in a generation games
[1:19:13] <+ConnieETC> There is a chest in the cave patches was in, he leaves one for you
[1:19:14] <modsformeandyou> I hate how some streamers crank the brightness up to the max for some reason and everything loses its color. My brightness is at 0 while playing. The default is ok as well.
[1:19:14] <%notsoy> there was a ladder against that wall
[1:19:15] <sweatch0> ladder my friend
[1:19:15] <razieltano123> Ladder

[1:22:57] <Sunstalker> Been playing abit, disappointed the flail is a dex not str weapon. peepoSad
[1:22:57] <%za7az> @EynoStiles I think that's the joke lol
[1:23:14] <deviljhojho_> if the game keeps this level of quality all the way to the end its most def GOTY
[1:23:21] <Aussie_Manny> Ooh, a hip lantern. Like Bloodborne.
[1:23:23] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah I remember hearing that the only thing Miyazaki designed in Sekiro is the guys that live in pots
[1:23:28] <%topendbuzza> ayy it's the fucked room again
[1:23:34] <senfood> the butter dog
[1:23:55] <x2Twistedx> omg you I took spoodermaned across the builds to get that stuff damm it
[1:23:58] <%NopeBadguy> I've been enjoying the game but I'm on PC so performance can be a real downer sometimes
[1:24:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I can't wait to find out the lore behind Pickled Turtle necks. like are turtles the storm lords spirit  beast lol
[1:24:18] <%invalid_robin> Wait what sword are you using?
[1:24:22] <sweatch0> that thing has a shield too?
[1:24:27] <XxMoliciousxX> not a big fan of pickled meat

[1:24:39] <%baka_sugoi> UwU
[1:24:41] <%NopeBadguy> Have you tried power stancing greatswords yet? I haven't found the Claymore yet so I haven't been able to try it
[1:24:42] <skagtheprinceofhell> This is the power of a monstrosity.
[1:24:44] <%invalid_robin> @PatStaresAt what sword are you using?
[1:24:44] <%solracc25> bleed?
[1:24:46] <%YakumoYomi> @NopeBadguy Agreed. The greatness is there, but a sudden stutter causing you to get hit or die doesn't feel great
[1:24:53] <Aussie_Manny> khadSnap
[1:24:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's too strong to get to live more then once.
[1:25:06] <ahmz1404> I think you can upgrade your flask potency
[1:25:09] <skagtheprinceofhell> So God said "You have power by only one life."
[1:25:11] <%cylish> Might I intrest you in a bit of fireball/doorway based cheese
[1:25:13] <Aussie_Manny> Sometimes the most ordinary weapon is the best.

[1:27:35] <deviljhojho_> they removed scrimblo from the game after the network test sadly
[1:27:41] <%NopeBadguy> With all these locations, you could legit say something like "Go to the Tower of Candice" and I'd fall for it legitimately
[1:27:43] <+ithonmage> I just started to watch anyone play, is the map smaller or bigger then people expected?
[1:27:53] <Aussie_Manny> Then expando your bimblo.

[1:31:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Is this place really this hard?!
[1:31:36] <%za7az> So Godrick really let his place go to shit, huh?
[1:31:37] <sirjames079> Read your soul
[1:31:44] <guffbud> He’s off his groove man
[1:31:46] <%Broand> I just sorta rode my horse past the castle

[1:31:52] <%RaziWraith> Seemed like the guard counter move was op until I saw that LUL
[1:31:53] <$realm_forge> That knight has a cool shield
[1:31:59] <ImTrin> @za7az have you seen the rest of the world? LUL
[1:31:59] <%cade_calrayn> Judging by Godrick's appearance, I think this is what he wanted
[1:32:01] <%za7az> Fair enough lol
[1:32:05] <%cade_calrayn> Considering he made those spider fuckers
[1:32:13] <+Beetlewins> We trained birds to throw barrels at people. Because we are dicks
[1:32:13] <ape_hawk> do you think the birds hate having swords on their feet or do they love it?
[1:32:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> they have bomb Eagles.
[1:32:23] <%NopeBadguy> @RaziWraith When you guard counter, you're taking a bet they don't follow up. If they do, you get beat
[1:32:28] <deviljhojho_> makes em feel confident
[1:32:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I want to summon a bomb eagle
[1:32:33] <Rbeatononefour> "holy shit 2 knives"
[1:32:33] <sirjames079> Really like Guard Counters as a mechanic, feels good but isn't too ovferpowered
[1:32:33] <Aussie_Manny> i bet they hate it
[1:32:33] <oda_flobunaga> Have you seen Godrick? The man is army in and of himself.
[1:32:35] <$realm_forge> Blade birds refuse the ascendancy of man
[1:32:36] <+dom3800> probably more than the chains through their wings
[1:32:37] <hermitdab> the birds are so evil they love it you gotta respect that
[1:32:38] <%CzeekyTV> their talons were removed and the blades grafted on so, they probably dont like it
[1:32:40] <digaogrunge> They love it for sure
[1:32:42] <%D00msDayDan> "i gotta tell you this is pretty terrific"
[1:32:42] <+Freakin_Wolfy> who needs to feel pretty when you have FREAKIN SWORDS ON YOUR FEET?
[1:33:02] <%NopeBadguy> I bet elmo would love to have swords for feet
[1:33:15] <%CzeekyTV> where did Pat find this sword?
[1:33:17] <BTB_Regulus> taking a break from playing it myself pat. its glorious isnt it?
[1:33:22] <%za7az> @za7az Just saying that for someone who wants be a god of some kind, he doesn't really seem to maintain his living space. Corpses everywhere LUL
[1:33:27] <athuramn> "he's winding up for a big stab, I better drop my shield and feel it"
[1:33:32] <Rbeatononefour> that's what you get for trying to be intimidating
[1:33:36] <%X2Eliah> It really seems like hitboxes just arent triggering sometimes
[1:33:36] <xxHungryxx> *Duct tapes steak knife to parrot*
[1:33:38] <%shootbang_exe> there is a shortcut if you're willing to run past the arm spider creature
[1:33:44] <mrcelab> @NopeBadguy he already have those
[1:34:05] <kingmemelord97> @xxHungryxx sounds like a metal gear boss
[1:34:07] <hermitdab> is this the bloodborne part?

[1:46:11] <Warstar696> This is an amazing representation of how a castle's inner defenses would be set up using multiple barricades and zones of fire.
[1:46:11] <sirjames079> I love the summons so much
[1:46:15] <%Dew217> I love watching Pat play souls games. The man is just too good
[1:46:18] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ape_hawk Why do we gotta keep bringing up Ds2? We're trying to see if Elden Ring is any good right now.

[1:49:43] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> These guys are strikingly similar to the Harald legion guys from Ds3.
[1:49:47] <%NopeBadguy> @superchronicc it was!
[1:49:50] <+BBnumber9> What is the theme of this game?

[1:50:55] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> It's those curved greats words and the way they swing them.
[1:51:01] <medril07> Never seems to go well for blacksmiths in these games
[1:51:02] <digaogrunge> Talk to spirit upgrade lady, see if she mentions your cape

[1:52:50] <ArgentUndaCova> @Warstar696 @oda_flobunaga Awesome thanks
[1:52:54] <jbrachob> lol nah, but yeah the idea of humanity/chaos has always been on of the coolest in the DS lore
[1:52:55] <Warstar696> Reject the weak, rotten "flame". Become Ascendant
[1:52:55] <DubDevilPlays> the one time I play an int build first
[1:52:55] <%abakkus> I keep thinking the grace bonfires look like humanity sprites but yellow. it's nice to see the little details they love pop up in non-souls games
[1:52:55] <Paperware> Black flame only lasts like 5 seconds though...
[1:53:00] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[1:53:01] <ape_hawk> the line between Paladin and Death Knight is REALLY thin
[1:53:03] <+TrickytheClown> @NigelSchnauzerpug Yes
[1:53:09] <XxMoliciousxX> is it just FTH or FTH and INT?
[1:53:10] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @za7az Shhhhhh don't trigger Plague
[1:53:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's not Black Flame.
[1:53:15] <rightye> what kind of build is he going? faith/str?
[1:53:18] <Guardiansaiyan> nice cape!
[1:53:18] <%NopeBadguy> dorkness
[1:53:21] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt out of the door, go right and fall down the ledge where you grabbed the item
[1:53:27] <%za7az> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy LUL
[1:53:37] <ape_hawk> ELDRITCH BLAST
[1:53:38] <%NopeBadguy> i figured it'd have a steeper arc for being "weighty"
[1:53:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug Has Pat encountered him yet?
[1:53:41] <+ThePich> DARKNESS IMPRISONING ME
[1:53:43] <%mongorific> I cant wait to play a faith build

[1:54:25] <+Zeromaru2> Bad dog
[1:54:33] <striderzer0> what is the move or weapon that is in all from soft games? crescent moon blade?
[1:54:43] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt don't forget to do cast math, you may get an extra cast of regular fireball
[1:54:55] <oda_flobunaga> @NigelSchnauzerpug early in stream 1 if you want to check the vod
[1:54:57] <%bilyso> and I think that new catalyst you got buffs it?
[1:54:57] <jbrachob> naw bro
[1:54:58] <GunEden> need something bigger
[1:55:02] <sirjames079> You have the right idea, but you need a different enemy
[1:55:02] <shotguncrucifix> elden jank
[1:55:03] <%X2Eliah> well then
[1:55:05] <AllenDeadman> do we need a bigger man?

[1:55:20] <guffbud> Try a big hammer of yours ?
[1:55:21] <AllenDeadman> is there any giants nearby?
[1:55:26] <Rbeatononefour> *BIGGER*
[1:55:27] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @za7az Jokes aside though, I completely sympathise with his point of Fromsoft being a bunch of unoriginal, lazy fucks when it comes to making new games. As high quality as they may turn out to be.
[1:55:29] <Warstar696> How much bigger, exactly?
[1:55:30] <chowndawg> does he have a big attack?
[1:55:35] <+ThePich> become giant

[2:04:14] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt or godwin gets his power from nightmare creatures
[2:04:15] <AllenDeadman> Pat, the picture there is of Godfrey, not Goldwin
[2:04:28] <XxMoliciousxX> gundam also starts with a "g" coincidence?
[2:04:30] <AllenDeadman> Goldwin was the first demigod that got killed

[2:05:45] <sweatch0> WOAH
[2:05:47] <senfood> Siiiiiick
[2:05:48] <ape_hawk> okay, NOW youre a death knight
[2:05:51] <MaritimeSpanker> Dope looking too
[2:05:54] <digaogrunge> FAST
[2:05:57] <MaritimeSpanker> oh he's burning
[2:06:02] <$tusk102> NICE
[2:06:07] <MaritimeSpanker> took about 100 points of extra damage, but yeah
[2:06:07] <jbrachob> lol
[2:06:07] <%X2Eliah> that timed out so fast
[2:06:09] <sweatch0> lasts 5 secs
[2:06:09] <%bilyso> at least it seems kinda cheap
[2:06:09] <+ArtemisCroc> it's meant to be used between attacks
[2:06:10] <TioXyco> it charges fast but also dissipates fast
[2:06:10] <%twoto858> Get him to hit the statue
[2:06:11] <MaritimeSpanker> it really should last longer
[2:06:11] <senfood> It was doing dot
[2:06:14] <Gray_LoFi> That spell running on horror game flashlight batteries
[2:06:15] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt can you chain the spell off swings? it sounded like it in the description
[2:06:16] <Heyestus> The tooltip says it can be imbued after attacks
[2:06:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> can you mix them
[2:06:28] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt It's got the faster when used in a combo thing
[2:06:29] <%SABiscotti> seems like it'd be better for fast weapons
[2:06:30] <%twilight_cleric> what's happened so far?
[2:06:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> BLACK HOLY FLAME BLADE
[2:06:38] <MaritimeSpanker> lasts for about 6-7 seconds
[2:06:42] <+AngryHomunculus> Are you playing this on PC @PatStaresAt?
[2:06:48] <senfood> It doesn't last as long as holy sword, sadlt
[2:06:50] <%tusk102> he already has blessed buff
[2:06:50] <Warstar696> @PatStaresAt check out that Magic Grease
[2:06:51] <$OranHexthief> its godkilling spells so probably super effective against certain holy enemies
[2:06:54] <%tusk102> @AngryHomunculus hes on ps5
[2:06:59] <$realm_forge> It looks cooler tho
[2:07:06] <%solracc25> can you upgrade the buff?
[2:07:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> Did you try that lever?
[2:07:21] <+AngryHomunculus> @AngryHomunculus OK thanks

[2:16:18] <adzy2k6> Hmm, the magical ammo seems much more prevalent than in other souls games?
[2:16:21] <Heyestus> They've got dead guys inside them
[2:16:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> I thought that it was Wine and Wax.
[2:16:27] <+sevorai> They're stuffed with people to give them personality @PatStaresAt
[2:16:30] <MrNoobMcSalt> Read the description on the MEAT
[2:16:33] <+AngryHomunculus> Maybe they use the meat as wax?
[2:16:33] <%BlueLunecy> I got a few sorceries that don't charge
[2:16:34] <%bundle_of_herbs> read them?
[2:16:35] <%X2Eliah> even the weapon upgrade spells?
[2:16:40] <%OrangeMDT> Did a pot full of meat attack you??
[2:16:42] <mrcelab> what? whent for a smoke. why are you fighting the pot man?
[2:16:46] <%Brassnarwhal> not assassins approach

[2:17:12] <sweatch0> :)
[2:17:13] <scrumbotime> the slop of man, mostly rotted
[2:17:16] <Warstar696> It's basically fermented, near-rotten meat.
[2:17:17] <Sigma_190_Beta> IT'S FOR FERMENTING!
[2:17:22] <GunEden> sp natto?
[2:17:24] <%JustToWatch> you can jump
[2:17:24] <AllenDeadman> you can jump on a ledge here
[2:17:27] <sweatch0> do a big hump
[2:17:28] <%JustToWatch> go back
[2:17:28] <%BlueLunecy> Parkour
[2:17:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> @42nfl19 What Minotaur area?
[2:17:29] <%MrMegaJackpots> jump
[2:17:29] <MaritimeSpanker> maybe from the boss room?
[2:17:31] <+sevorai> there's a ledge behind you @PatStaresAt
[2:17:32] <%bundle_of_herbs> what about the jar shard?
[2:17:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt So it is a wax top, but it's filled with Fermenting Meat.
[2:17:33] <MaritimeSpanker> like post-boss?
[2:17:35] <razieltano123> Save first.
[2:17:35] <luciluxlu0> I'm still trying
[2:17:41] <ape_hawk> keep parkouring
[2:17:45] <%cade_calrayn> hardcore parkour
[2:17:48] <Warstar696> Which is USUALLY an extremely bad idea since there's a good chance trying to ferment meat will end up with a lethal result.
[2:17:50] <%MrMegaJackpots> by the dead guy
[2:17:52] <WillSin4Cash> harcoure parkore
[2:17:54] <%JustToWatch> from where you just picked up the knives
[2:17:56] <42nfl19> @skagtheprinceofhell The one with the fire puzzle
[2:18:01] <AllenDeadman> from where you picked the item you can jump onto the ledge of the wall
[2:18:02] <Tenebrae94> dont forget you have two seeds
[2:18:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also, summon the lady?
[2:18:05] <+sevorai> go to the ledge on the other side
[2:18:09] <pi_in_the_sci> estus charge
[2:18:13] <skagtheprinceofhell> @42nfl19 What fire puzzle?
[2:18:26] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Did you complete the fire puzzle in the minotaur area and beat that supposed boss?
[2:18:39] <slix3431> I'd say Pat has no bitches but he has Elmo
[2:18:49] <42nfl19> @skagtheprinceofhell from yesterdays stream
[2:18:52] <mrcelab> grease amount
[2:18:53] <slix3431> Also FUCK your char looks just like you
[2:19:04] <MaritimeSpanker> OH
[2:19:10] <MaritimeSpanker> that's super sneaky
[2:19:17] <tanarath> Galaxy-brain strats
[2:19:23] <%BlueLunecy> That really just opens up the nightmare of "Where can I go"?
[2:19:25] <sirjames079> When From give you a jump button they're not fuckin' around
[2:19:26] <+mikesapartment> i missed this one lol
[2:19:26] <Tenebrae94> wow actually parcor
[2:19:38] <luciluxlu0> I missed this completely
[2:19:42] <Warstar696> Far better than the stupid dodge-roll onto a ledge shit.
[2:19:43] <AllenDeadman> use that jump or get FUCKED
[2:19:43] <adzy2k6> Says the guy who is notorious for missing stuff that everyone on stream can see
[2:19:45] <%shootbang_exe> yeah I blinked and missed how you got to the second tree boss
[2:19:46] <jubejube56> adding a jump button gave the map designers too much power
[2:19:49] <MaritimeSpanker> Man, the game is throwing upgrade materials at you left and right!

[2:23:07] <slix3431> How hard are you shitting?
[2:23:09] <AthenaAegis> DOOMP
[2:23:16] <FallenVerto81> This looks like a competent 3D Castlevania
[2:23:25] <Warstar696> Looks like it
[2:23:25] <+mikesapartment> :)
[2:23:27] <%YakumoYomi> Big Fat DUMPSSS
[2:23:31] <AllenDeadman> THIS is how you were supposed to do the thing you did by just jumping
[2:23:34] <AllenDeadman> LUL
[2:23:35] <FallenVerto81> DaS game with platforming
[2:23:36] <@TheYellowcouch> Everything is an alternate path
[2:23:36] <%Bloomingzonda> I always ennuciate my dumnps since my neighbors started watching when I poop
[2:23:42] <%barrakuta371> when I enunciate dumps i sometimes yell kamahameha
[2:23:54] <$Jaxnos> i am now convinced after this one hour that i missed 80% of the castle
[2:23:54] <pi_in_the_sci> go over there and look for jumps I guess
[2:23:56] <AllenDeadman> I genuinely have no idea
[2:24:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> Do you mean when you first enter the area?
[2:24:02] <AllenDeadman> it's driving me insane
[2:24:06] <+Shimano232> Pat, there is another secret on the rampart wall grace.
[2:24:07] <digaogrunge> ROOF PARKOUR
[2:24:07] <+ThePich> jump
[2:24:11] <shotguncrucifix> pat gets no items
[2:24:11] <+sevorai> Where exactly?
[2:24:13] <Warstar696> @PatStaresAt did you read the Magic Grease spell yet?
[2:24:18] <jubejube56> Like with the branch holes are?
[2:24:19] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt remember the place with the birds high up?
[2:24:21] <lucasnunez90> Something with the elevator shaft you fell down?
[2:24:25] <AllenDeadman> that's her
[2:24:26] <MaritimeSpanker> that was the NPC
[2:24:28] <%scarman125> was watching EpicNameBro's vod of this game and that dude is just a massive ball of negative.
[2:24:35] <MaritimeSpanker> big girl warrior
[2:24:36] <ape_hawk> yeyeyeyeyeyye
[2:24:37] <%notsoy> JOLLY COOPERATION
[2:24:45] <42nfl19> are these real or fake summons?
[2:24:45] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt IIRC you have to climb up in the corridor-wall, and then there's another hole in the wall to get outside
[2:24:48] <+sevorai> @PatStaresAt player summon signs and NPC signs are different if you look
[2:24:48] <%Brassnarwhal> Hey Whoever was looking for a glintstone staff earlier, i found one you can get before godrick. If you take the path that goes past stormveil inbetween the castle and the broken bridge you can get to liurnia, keep following the path past the church down through the crevice through the enemy camp and stay on the road until you meet  a merchant, he sells it he's near a site of grace on the road
[2:24:55] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt so, there's a stone staircase near one of those 2 elevators, by the item. I think that's what you're looking for
[2:24:56] <sirjames079> Time for a dope ass fight
[2:25:14] <%machshop> LUL
[2:25:15] <+Walopoh> cool of them to include a Whack-a-Mole minigame outside of every boss fight
[2:25:18] <+mikesapartment> rip jesus *****
[2:25:27] <%NopeBadguy> Pat, if you don't enunciate your jumps, how will the audio listeners know?
[2:25:27] <%Bloomingzonda> Jesus Fucker is definitely a NPC
[2:25:29] <sirjames079> The censor that's just complete stars is really unnerving
[2:25:30] <MaritimeSpanker> all the rest looked to be people

[2:27:58] <+taeasakura> OLEG! OLEG! OLEG!
[2:27:58] <%Dakuu75> @ImTrin seems to be the case. it's why that giant spider any enemy with a bunch of limbs is like that too
[2:27:58] <senfood> Oleg is holding it down

[2:28:02] <%greasypete00> are you so sure
[2:28:05] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @scarman125 Thats not entirely fair towards him. He did say in his first stream that the game is waaay better than he was expecting. A comment like that coming from a supposed "massive ball of negative" is quite significant. Considering he is one of the biggest souls veterans.
[2:28:09] <xxHungryxx> Oleg is best Pokemon

[2:32:11] <Macguffn> was that great rune just multiple darksigns overlayed on one another?
[2:32:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> grafting is a tree thing where you put one tree on the other
[2:32:16] <Omenaire_> dadfeeDance
[2:32:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wonder where the barbarian woman is
[2:32:36] <%Dew217> Great Boss fight
[2:32:43] <%Dew217> Man got a cool dragon arm
[2:33:04] <xxHungryxx> go get a snack folks we just getting started
[2:33:05] <Warstar696> More precisely: grafting is when a limb from one tree is taken and matched with the bark of a similar tree.
[2:33:07] <Sunstalker> Hey chat, where did Pat find that monkey npc that was a bush?

[2:38:05] <+FattimusSlime> Speaking of massive shit though, did Pat fight Poop Eater yet?
[2:38:05] <%notsoy> you really think he's beating a fromsoft game in two days
[2:38:07] <%sniffy77> Pat is now at least 1/6 of the way done with the game
[2:38:09] <%tusk102> @ExpressNode like maybe 1/6
[2:38:10] <Warstar696> @ExpressNode he's like.. 10% of the way through?
[2:38:12] <TheDeimion> Limbs Grave
[2:38:12] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Hey Chat. Can anyone else agree that as negative as EpicNameBro is coming off in his streams of Elden Ring, that people are being way too harsh towards him.
[2:38:14] <%Criotos> this is just beating the first actual legacy style dungeon

[2:40:39] <Warstar696> LUL it's a biohazard symbol
[2:40:46] <luciluxlu0> You have to use a rune arc to activate it tho
[2:40:46] <%cade_calrayn> So the runes are part of the Elden Ring?
[2:40:51] <scrumbotime> gotta eat one of the co-op reward rings
[2:40:51] <MaritimeSpanker> does it go in a slot down there?
[2:40:52] <%greasypete00> you have to have another item to use it also, a rune arc
[2:40:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Straight forward
[2:40:55] <darce_avidson> 5 for every stat while active
[2:40:58] <%Nkbzodiac> try fingers but hole
[2:41:04] <AMiserablePileOfShiitake> +5 And you need humanity.
[2:41:06] <MaritimeSpanker> I think that might be Godfrey's fingers
[2:41:10] <%sniffy77> Its a temporary buff used for THE RUNS against big bosses
[2:41:13] <%machshop> wooooow
[2:41:14] <MaritimeSpanker> 5?!?!?!
[2:41:17] <%sniffy77> or whenever you want
[2:41:17] <%HiroProtagonest> Rune arcs are basically humanities/embers, but they're emphasizing the part of embers where you got a buff
[2:41:17] <MaritimeSpanker> Holy shit
[2:41:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its customizable embering

[2:53:26] <p_e_a_x> its the new huumanity but it doesnt debuff you if you loose it but instead buffs you if you use it
[2:53:28] <%AsherCaelum> You get +1 to all stats just for equipping it, and even more if you use a Rune Arc
[2:53:33] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed a grace in the boss room
[2:53:49] <%JustToWatch> no wait I thought you had 19, you need 20
[2:53:55] <%YakumoYomi> psaHoldon

[2:54:18] <+rbakervv> @JustToWatch he does have 20 with all his buffs

[2:54:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> youre a freak of nature lol

[2:55:20] <%vexion_smh> eh cool enough
[2:55:24] <%slandracon> I BET YOU CAN WEAR 2
[2:55:24] <jbrachob> DRAGON KNIGHT
[2:55:24] <%greasypete00> maybe you could duplicate the boss soul and get two os those
[2:55:27] <MaritimeSpanker> it required 20 strength, he has 17
[2:55:29] <+itsanonbunny> smh
[2:55:30] <AllenDeadman> IT LINGERS
[2:55:31] <%JustToWatch> wait doesn't this game have duel stance
[2:55:32] <+Shimano232> huge AoE
[2:55:32] <skagtheprinceofhell> Maybe you can use this guy to smash the staute?
[2:55:33] <+ConnieETC> Two hand it with boss soul Kappa
[2:55:33] <jubejube56> wait if you had duplicated it could you dual wield dragon hands?
[2:55:36] <mor3gan> more dots
[2:55:36] <Carlioo> yeah but it looks cool tho
[2:55:42] <Gray_LoFi> Flames linger though
[2:55:44] <Warstar696> Small AoE DoT
[2:55:48] <%SABiscotti> big lingering AoE fire
[2:55:50] <%Dakuu75> oh but, it's making DoT spots on the ground I guess.
[2:55:56] <+rbakervv> @MaritimeSpanker he's getting +1 from the great rune, and +2 from something else, i don't knwo what
[2:56:04] <jbrachob> the main explosion probably does most of the damage

[3:17:22] <%TaurusOxford> @ape_hawk that's not how it works
[3:17:22] <MaritimeSpanker> Bleed knoife?
[3:17:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> What's keeping them up there

[3:19:45] <%slandracon> holy up?
[3:19:50] <moonbearbacon> does that mean you could learn the wing move too?
[3:19:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yo this guy makes me wanna do strength build lol.
[3:19:52] <digaogrunge> Just do it
[3:19:53] <TioXyco> you totally can
[3:19:53] <+abrupt_abe> He fell into a hole for me LUL
[3:19:55] <+Pachi3000> he thinks he can do it
[3:19:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> Birds should follow.
[3:20:02] <Sigma_190_Beta> :)
[3:20:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Try bleeding him
[3:20:03] <TheDeimion> so that's why those guys do big stomps, they have the super dragon powers
[3:20:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> ?
[3:20:09] <%Hexidimentional> and there it is
[3:20:10] <+sevorai> Literally just CHEESED him big kiting him to the ledge and spammed fireballs
[3:20:13] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Have you tried not getting hit ?
[3:20:16] <+AFellowDegen> where did he get that shield?
[3:20:17] <z_mad_j> the two handed attack it punished  with a jump heavy if your fast
[3:20:20] <TheDeimion> bleed him with imps
[3:20:21] <Warstar696> Bleed did nothing
[3:20:24] <ape_hawk> try running away from him
[3:20:26] <ape_hawk> like a coward
[3:20:27] <+DeaconBluesClues> seconding bleed, it's rather good in this game
[3:20:28] <+mlow44> I cheesed this dude by backing up along the narrow path you come from and shooting him with magic
[3:20:34] <%BackflipCharm> Bleed him with fire
[3:20:36] <z_mad_j> no
[3:20:38] <+Walopoh> legit thought you were calling Paige pookie
[3:20:44] <jbrachob> the black flame did more damage
[3:20:46] <MaritimeSpanker> I would say "Git gud", but pat has been doing very guud in my opinon
[3:20:47] <radiorosewater> birds should follow, try bleeding him, visions of defeat
[3:20:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thats probably what Pookie meant
[3:20:52] <z_mad_j> bleed immune
[3:21:00] <%Hexidimentional> he appears to be immune to bleed
[3:21:09] <%Dakuu75> Guys, all these Heavy-Armor bros are immune or highly resistant to bleed. It's not the kill-everything-stat
[3:21:10] <Rbeatononefour> not through his shield!
[3:21:13] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He has no blood
[3:21:17] <z_mad_j> I tried alot
[3:21:22] <tanarath> rotate left so it doesn't get blocked as much?
[3:21:24] <+Local16> This man went to school to learn how to beat the cheese
[3:21:24] <TioXyco> either he got high bleed resist, or just negate it entirely
[3:21:24] <sirrice77> I found it best to just parry this guy
[3:21:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> Maybe use the mixed flask as well?
[3:21:30] <thesaverofhumens> bleed is for bosses/giants without armor
[3:21:32] <ape_hawk> he has no blood so hes just full of cum
[3:21:33] <Warstar696> Damn
[3:21:33] <TheDeimion> man these strings just keep going
[3:21:34] <jbrachob> LOL

[3:21:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bulldog Summon when?
[3:21:58] <xxHungryxx> these dude kick the shit out of BKs ngl
[3:22:00] <DegenCat> Giefy <3
[3:22:03] <z_mad_j> you just have to punish him when he whiffs
[3:22:03] <+Pachi3000> dog is here now
[3:22:03] <jbrachob> can you summon oleg?
[3:22:05] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[3:22:11] <%cade_calrayn> what's the glowing fallen statue in the Stormveil castle courtyard?
[3:22:20] <Heyestus> When will Zangief spin his cocoon and emerge with a neck, Pat?
[3:22:22] <Warstar696> Fucking birds
[3:22:23] <%JustToWatch> did u try givin him the ol dicktwist
[3:22:27] <$realm_forge> The meat has been summoned
[3:22:27] <TheDeimion> almost got killed by birds
[3:22:29] <%LorcaNomad> can't summon oleg on this guy no
[3:22:35] <+Deebo305> Summon ghost maybe
[3:22:36] <%Brassnarwhal> You can only summon when theres a gravestone symbol on the left
[3:22:36] <%Gloom_Tangerine> You got the power, you got the might, you’re ready for battle, beat the black knight!
[3:22:40] <sirrice77> @cade_calrayn if a giant enemy hits it they will break it and its full of upgrade mats
[3:22:42] <ape_hawk> try giving him dragon head
[3:22:44] <CaptHoneydew> @JustToWatch he'd get demonitized
[3:22:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Does he resist holy?
[3:22:47] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:22:53] <z_mad_j> lol
[3:22:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Okay serious question, Pat how do you stay so calm in these situations?
[3:22:55] <+Walopoh> LUL
[3:23:00] <%LorcaNomad> more like HOW did the write a message there
[3:23:04] <%cade_calrayn> @sirrice77 gracias
[3:23:05] <+AFellowDegen> sometimes it just... doesn't break
[3:23:13] <jbrachob> nice trade
[3:23:17] <tanarath> @cade_calrayn get a BIG enemy to break it. There's one somewhat nearby. Did you need the claymore location, btw?
[3:23:20] <%Dakuu75> probably bugged and let them stand there for a sec
[3:23:38] <thesaverofhumens> @TurtlesAndTentacles hes used to these games
[3:23:48] <TheDeimion> these enemies just keep going in Elden
[3:24:01] <TheDeimion> oh no
[3:24:04] <%JustToWatch> (For real though if you want it I can tell you how to jank him)
[3:24:08] <z_mad_j> I believe in you yahhhh
[3:24:09] <+Infernal_Dalek> Point-blank seems like a bad range for that jump attack.
[3:24:12] <thesaverofhumens> It's amazing they even gave minibosses phases
[3:24:21] <jbrachob> try hitting him with magic when he is that far
[3:24:38] <TheDeimion> OMG
[3:24:40] <Warstar696> Tail whip is highly effective, apparently.
[3:24:42] <%Hexidimentional> he's so fucking cooool
[3:24:43] <+Walopoh> dang that massive tail sweep
[3:24:43] <TheDeimion> that tree ate it hard LUL
[3:24:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @thesaverofhumens It seems lke people whove played alot of these games too still panic way more than him. He has nerves of steel
[3:24:52] <%Hexidimentional> sorry pat i'm rooting for the dragon knight
[3:24:55] <+Pachi3000> Nice
[3:24:55] <MaritimeSpanker> He's like an Alto Angelo!

[3:26:19] <+fauxfeels> secrets everywhere lol
[3:26:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did some testing, looks like armor doesnt matter that much like in ds3. 11 phys (shirt armor no helmet) and 23 phys (full knight armor) was only about a 10 health loss difference. So fashion souls it up
[3:26:41] <TheDeimion> grass was touched
[3:26:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> @justtowatch thay guy can DEFINITELY be bled, that's how I beat him
[3:26:50] <%Monkeyweed21> have you been in the cellar yet? I dont have the keys to get it
[3:26:52] <%Dakuu75> this is the area I was thinking of. go down those wood stairs, then find the stone steps. and there's a drop off point
[3:26:53] <Warstar696> Touch the grass, do it fast
[3:26:56] <PersonifiedTFT> what was down there anyway, I just got here and that's the only place in all of the castle i haven't found
[3:27:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt I saw one bannister that you could walk across to get one of the items at the very start.
[3:27:16] <%LorcaNomad> toot
[3:27:22] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> that armor looks cool where he get it?
[3:27:37] <TheDeimion> mountain goatin' around the castle
[3:27:38] <Heyestus> @personifiedtft a knight with a neat faith miracle
[3:27:56] <PersonifiedTFT> @Heyestus cool, i'll have to check that eventually
[3:28:04] <%Dakuu75> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends a "dog pit" as he described. (idk where exactly, sry)
[3:28:31] <+AFellowDegen> Does anyone know where he found his shield?
[3:28:52] <TheDeimion> go go go Pat
[3:28:58] <+HellfireComms> hey Pat, how's Elden Ring treating you
[3:29:02] <+AFellowDegen> ty ty
[3:29:10] <Warstar696> FUCK 'EM UP
[3:29:17] <%Nekros4442> yeah the starting jobbers
[3:29:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt whats in the cellar with the rats? I didnt have enough stone keys to open it
[3:29:27] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if that would boost the dragoon jump, ash art
[3:29:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> bird down

[3:33:54] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 34m.
[3:33:54] <jbrachob> DOOOOOOOOT
[3:34:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Man Assassin creed really took a different direction with the remake
[3:34:23] <Warstar696> Perfect
[3:34:39] <Ner234> Speedruns for this game are going to be the wildest shit LUL
[3:34:56] <TheDeimion> it seems like fall damage has been turned into either you're fine and take no damage or you die

[3:35:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Its a shame that everything except you seems to have hyperarmor for everything LUL
[3:35:24] <MittensBroadcast> bodied
[3:35:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt after some testing, looks like armor is back to mostly fashion. 11 phys vs 23 phys is only like a 10 hp health loss difference
[3:35:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> "Piss off Ghosts!"
[3:35:31] <tanarath> those knights DO NOT CARE
[3:35:54] <+AFellowDegen> cant wait to watch your playthrough of this after I beat it
[3:35:57] <tanarath> Wait, armor is JUST fashion?!?
[3:35:58] <%DashXero> Or a fancy hat that you don't wanna wear...

[3:36:26] <tanarath> @tusk102 fair
[3:36:27] <propmaster256> Pat just jumping down to say hi to dad.
[3:36:28] <PersonifiedTFT> why hello ther
[3:36:29] <jubejube56> Lol I like that you get greeted by that face there
[3:36:30] <NewWillinium> Was that a face?
[3:36:32] <%DashXero> Stormveil is a big place.
[3:36:38] <Heyestus> I can just imagine someone missing that jump and freaking out over that head LUL
[3:36:43] <PersonifiedTFT> yes chat that was a face, there's a way to get down there safely
[3:36:44] <SkinnyRite> dDOOOOOT

[3:36:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> That was a face
[3:36:56] <%MelfinaStarwind> big doot
[3:36:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Does it still have the DS3 problem where you take a MASSIVE hit to defense if any armor slot is empty?
[3:37:05] <tanarath> @slandracon @bluebiscuitgt A place you CAN go, Pat went there earlier
[3:37:06] <odnucaf3> Was that designed on porpuse? the fact that you can fall right next to that creature.
[3:37:33] <+AFellowDegen> @Monkeyweed21 wait that was a thing?
[3:37:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> @tanarath must have been when I was having dinner
[3:37:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you don't. when i tested that resistance thing i wasnt wearing a helmet
[3:37:45] <Cymen90> Crazy how much this game changes up the feel. It went from Beath of the Soul to classic DS1 Undead Burg design
[3:37:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Vatii did say having armor gives Poise. Im a souls baby so I dont know if that was always a thing
[3:38:06] <dahkdm> !uptime
[3:38:06] <@Moobot> @dahkdm I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 38m.
[3:38:20] <@Fuggins4U> is Pat still varnished?
[3:38:30] <Cymen90> Use the Korok Leaf to blow them off the bridge!
[3:38:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @AFellowDegen yea wearing even the shittiest lightest hat would make you take 20% less damage, same applied to every slot
[3:38:41] <mrcelab> just shoot the guys from above with a bow Pat
[3:38:42] <tanarath> @bluebiscuitgt you can platform there from a room RIGHT before the boss of Stormveil.
[3:38:44] <thesaverofhumens> @Fuggins4U now he's garnished
[3:38:51] <tanarath> Among other places
[3:38:56] <Warstar696> What a giant pair of dicks

[3:39:04] <MaritimeSpanker> Good onya
[3:39:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it doesnt have that weird "wear armor always" system, i wasnt wearing a helmet when i tested it
[3:39:07] <BlueBiscuitGT> @tanarath thanks good to know
[3:39:08] <TheDeimion> :b Pat just needed to try

[3:39:35] <Warstar696> Give us FINGERS instead of eyes?
[3:39:42] <tanarath> You're gotta jump, though. It's not immediately obvious. @bluebiscuitgt
[3:39:51] <TheDeimion> summons engaged?
[3:39:59] <Sunstalker> Are upgrade stones easier to get later in the game? They're so stingy for me atm
[3:40:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> So in that side entrance, I think I saw something.
[3:40:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @Sunstalker the game drowns you in materials

[4:01:25] <tanarath> No-scoping archers
[4:01:37] <+forge_cleric> is there no recovering lost souls in this game?
[4:01:44] <TheDeimion> you will not survive without taking them out by going around the right side where those rats and viking bois are
[4:01:49] <TheDeimion> also those orbs just kill u LUL

[4:02:08] <%OrangeMDT> It didn’t helps
[4:02:09] <Irishgamerlawd> they really locked down zone skipping
[4:02:11] <%Deft_Thought> Maybe those do more damage in water
[4:02:13] <+forge_cleric> do you lose anything when you die?
[4:02:23] <Shardlab> @forge_cleric You can recover your runes... if you don't die before you pick em up
[4:02:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> dignity
[4:02:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe equip the talisman that reduces magic damage?
[4:02:37] <TheDeimion> @SadisticAphid60 nah just a giant geode from what I can tell from the "sky"
[4:02:41] <TheDeimion> 4Head
[4:03:02] <lockhead45> Couldn't you summon Oleg to act as bait?
[4:03:04] <MaritimeSpanker> they're glass cannons
[4:03:20] <TheDeimion> Pat is also pretty strong for this area
[4:03:26] <%DashXero> Killing them is difficult because you have to find them before they find you, it seems.
[4:03:26] <BlueBiscuitGT> halfway there
[4:03:36] <+Sindellah> what lvl is Pat?
[4:03:37] <TheDeimion> so they aren't really glass canons , it's just that he's a strong lil man
[4:03:50] <guffbud> Shoot the ball, see if you can kill it
[4:04:00] <TheDeimion> ^
[4:04:11] <SadisticAphid60> what the fuck was that
[4:04:15] <TheDeimion> that might kill it but also might make it go off and kill you; haven't seen it done
[4:04:21] <+itsanonbunny> so far, has pat encountered any poison areas?
[4:04:26] <TheDeimion> plants are weak to fire more at 11
[4:04:30] <tanarath> They were always weak
[4:04:42] <Warstar696> Multiple areas have poison
[4:04:44] <lucasnunez90> Yees
[4:04:47] <+Saggitori> There needs to be a guile enemy that teaches you not to always jump in
[4:04:53] <Shardlab> After running an INT spellcaster build, I'm insanely jealous of the Faith abilities
[4:04:53] <+itsanonbunny> lmao i was not sure this was one
[4:04:57] <TheDeimion> not poison area, just poison flower specifically
[4:05:01] <tanarath> A swamp, an underground fake swamp, aaand....
[4:05:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> a room with poison enemies does not a poison area make
[4:05:04] <+forge_cleric> i thik they're asking like the traditional soulsborne poison swamp
[4:05:05] <razieltano123> bleed
[4:05:24] <+itsanonbunny> i was thinking swamp
[4:05:25] <wolfs_x> I saw a guy entirely bypass the castle and it sure seems there's a lot of map to get lost in
[4:05:28] <+oAznoUta> that's one sturdy flower
[4:05:29] <Shardlab> @forge_cleric There's one... I ran into it this morning
[4:05:31] <TheDeimion> dang that stun
[4:05:31] <lockhead45> Maybe the Dark flame?
[4:05:35] <%Deft_Thought> Plant's casting holy over here

[4:12:44] <%DashXero> That thing was hiding behind a beer can!
[4:12:46] <%Monkeyweed21> from the description it sounds like they drop from mimics
[4:12:56] <sirjames079> COMBO'D
[4:13:00] <Artemisky> F
[4:13:05] <TheDeimion> haven't seen a mimic yet tho
[4:13:10] <%gitgouda> exactly
[4:13:14] <%Brassnarwhal> these ghost vikings made me think my render distance was fucked earlier
[4:13:18] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> OR HAVE YOU
[4:13:28] <%LorcaNomad> monkaS
[4:13:29] <Irishgamerlawd> mini boss mimics?
[4:13:29] <42nfl19> I wonder if there is a skill or weapon that gives you that bloodborne dash instead of a roll
[4:13:31] <Hepathos87> what is YOU are the mimic
[4:13:34] <@TheYellowcouch> Mimic ladder let's goooo
[4:13:36] <+tempestzephyr> mimic boss?
[4:13:38] <%za7az> Not really tbh
[4:13:39] <+forge_cleric> oh no the cape goes through the shield
[4:13:40] <TheDeimion> I have seen a very eclipse region so there very well could be a mimic zone LUL
[4:13:41] <+Infernal_Dalek> You mean more than chests?
[4:13:41] <theanora1> Mimic+
[4:13:42] <Warstar696> @Brassnarwhal spectral minotaurs, really.
[4:13:43] <%Monkeyweed21> have you seen the grace mimics patches sells
[4:13:43] <%Brassnarwhal> MIMIC BONFIRE MIMIC BONFIRE
[4:13:44] <%YakumoYomi> You sayin' we might actually have DOOR or LADDER mimics?!
[4:13:47] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> what if that tree is a mimic
[4:13:49] <%DashXero> Were we the true mimicks all along?
[4:13:53] <penitentpendant> Bonus points if Mimics are disguised as sites of grace
[4:13:57] <Warstar696> @YakumoYomi or worse: mimic mimics
[4:13:57] <TheDeimion> I hope there is a mimic zone...
[4:13:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @warstar696 that's fair
[4:14:03] <penitentpendant> Go the FF12 route
[4:14:03] <Irishgamerlawd> Imagine the chest after a boss is a boss mimic xD
[4:14:06] <SilverRoddo> RPGEmpty
[4:14:10] <%HiroProtagonest> Mimic that's just Door Lord from Gungeon
[4:14:17] <%bundle_of_herbs> so like a shadow link situation?
[4:14:18] <%Monkeyweed21> What if they mimic all environmental objects instead of just chests?
[4:14:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @thedeimion yeah then you just play Prey for about a zone
[4:14:20] <%YakumoYomi> @Warstar696 Oh shit!
[4:14:21] <MaritimeSpanker> are these dudes the first enemies to get really stun-locked by the dragon fire?
[4:14:28] <radiorosewater> yes i agree
[4:14:36] <MaritimeSpanker> because all the armor dudes in the castle basically just walkted through it
[4:14:36] <wolfs_x> crab!!!
[4:14:37] <Irishgamerlawd> a DOOR eats you
[4:14:41] <Hepathos87> what if the mimic is the friendships we made on the way
[4:14:44] <Warstar696> @YakumoYomi there is an actual mimic mimic in King's Field... 2? 3? I don't remember
[4:14:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @maritimespanker most enemies die before they get stunlocked
[4:14:54] <%Puhff> Mimics have been getting progressively harder in each game...
[4:15:00] <Parapattern> A merchant mimic
[4:15:00] <MaritimeSpanker> aah
[4:15:07] <%Monkeyweed21> where's will?
[4:15:14] <Hepathos87> @Warstar696 there are chest skeletons I think, they pop out
[4:15:15] <%thbluewarden> HA
[4:15:16] <MaritimeSpanker> fuckin'
[4:15:16] <Ner234> ugh
[4:15:17] <%SABiscotti> UGH
[4:15:22] <%ThomasOfTroy> -4
[4:15:24] <MaritimeSpanker> bad pat
[4:15:26] <Warstar696> @YakumoYomi it appears like a normal enemy, then once defeated it leaves a corpse.. which you don't touch unless you want to get absolutely fucking trashed.
[4:15:27] <SadisticAphid60> I bought DS3 2 years ago but only played it for an hour. I guess I'll beat it after I beat Elden Ring.
[4:15:29] <ImTrin> ambush success?
[4:15:30] <%YakumoYomi> More importantly: where are Jack and Karen?
[4:15:35] <Irishgamerlawd> aha! now whos all what was that noise

[4:18:40] <Warstar696> Just get fucked: the area.
[4:18:41] <%LorcaNomad> why are those arrows so big tho
[4:18:43] <Hepathos87> fukken eagle eyed
[4:18:50] <it_came_from_outer_space> Pain
[4:18:50] <Warstar696> WOW.
[4:18:55] <Warstar696> What is this tech?
[4:18:55] <%sniffy77> I'm at Liurnia right now, enemies drop a bit more, but don't expect any easy farming for 10K souls in a minute
[4:19:06] <Artemisky> lmao the arrows
[4:19:09] <Foxchad> those guys are tilting me and i haven played the game
[4:19:12] <TheDeimion> only a well timed dodge roll will save you from those archers out in the open Pat they WILL hit you
[4:19:12] <Omenaire_> those arrows are just obnoxious haha
[4:19:13] <SadisticAphid60> giant arrows sticking out of your body
[4:19:16] <+oAznoUta> it's so cool that they just straight up put New York in this game
[4:19:17] <Hepathos87> man the BGM is so unnerving
[4:19:17] <Irishgamerlawd> Boss candles from salt and sanctuary
[4:19:18] <+itsanonbunny> omg this area is so pretty
[4:19:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> Caveman Hawkeye
[4:19:19] <CptHarlok> Sir, you've got something sticking out of you
[4:19:21] <Daskolin> Heat seeking arrows?
[4:19:23] <penitentpendant> Up?
[4:19:26] <ape_hawk> up
[4:19:27] <+ShadowRFox> I think the reason behind enemies dropping little runes is due to the devs trying to balance grinders. Otherwise, it would be too easy to grind runes on mobs.
[4:19:28] <jubejube56> It also probably makes handling open world progression easier by having just the bosses give a ton
[4:19:29] <MaybeFalco> :)
[4:19:30] <Warstar696> To where?
[4:19:30] <+Zeromaru2> Those are lances no Arrows

[4:48:11] <Foxchad> summon the archer pat
[4:48:14] <jubejube56> The mount in this keeps making me think it will be the astral chain mount that auto dodged everything
[4:48:15] <MaritimeSpanker> apparantly the Demi-humans are very damm good summons, I've heard
[4:48:15] <digaogrunge> He has fanboy in his name after all

[4:48:21] <%greasypete00> they can take more hits than you LUL
[4:48:21] <penitentpendant> Considering the amount of AoEs this boss does, single summons seem better
[4:48:22] <MaritimeSpanker> unsure if truth though
[4:48:24] <%josnotforlewd> Oh yeah, i've seen everything here a million times in other games, mhmm definately
[4:48:27] <+oAznoUta> that is indeed some pretty irate gardening equipment

[4:49:22] <+eanscrale> at least from didn't copy paste a bunch of seo search terms together to make a user name
[4:49:22] <TheDeimion> maybe the new archer??
[4:49:28] <TheDeimion> might be good distraction
[4:49:29] <%Mister_McDerp> who would win a mummy EVA or some monkeys?
[4:49:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt skeletons are really good at surviving and distracting enemies

[4:49:59] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah the skeleys keep rezzing
[4:50:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they keep the rez as spirits
[4:50:01] <ape_hawk> SKELETON WARRIORS
[4:50:04] <TheDeimion> ooo let's see how this do
[4:50:05] <penitentpendant> Leeeeeerooooyyyy
[4:50:11] <Macguffn> Why not use sniper that stay our of range and do damage you just got?
[4:50:12] <%blankwaffle> my dog likes he whole family to be in the same room lmao
[4:50:17] <MaritimeSpanker> DA DA DA DAAA DAAA
[4:50:19] <TheDeimion> oh he does shoot the good arrows
[4:50:31] <TheDeimion> but isn't ver' tanky
[4:50:32] <SadisticAphid60> arrow in ass
[4:50:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh wow, Ancestral Follower is terrible for this lol
[4:50:45] <TheDeimion> not for this fight
[4:50:45] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the skeletons are hard to kill because they keep the resurrection thing so if the boss doesnt hit their corpses they get back up
[4:50:48] <ape_hawk> the archer is doing like 54 dmg a pop
[4:50:51] <MaritimeSpanker> I'd go with the monke army again
[4:50:51] <Foxchad> 54 dmg oof
[4:50:51] <binku_muja_> boss seemed far more distracted when you had the mob of summons.
[4:50:54] <MaritimeSpanker> they did bretty good
[4:50:56] <ape_hawk> JELLYFISH, JELLYFISH
[4:50:57] <Macguffn> that was in fact shockingly bad
[4:50:59] <STORMWIZARD1> Ok worth a try...noted
[4:51:02] <%Mister_McDerp> well he is unupgraded
[4:51:05] <%LorcaNomad> this guy definitely works better for crowd summons
[4:51:10] <Ner234> "Nice" LUL
[4:51:10] <TheDeimion> there's a couple actually
[4:51:11] <luciluxlu0> lightning spear helps with the boss. You just have to get it.
[4:51:14] <%FacetiousAF> finally, paige's harem
[4:51:16] <penitentpendant> Paige about to become The Punch Necromancer
[4:51:17] <%LorcaNomad> LUL
[4:51:17] <TheDeimion> skeleton bandits and spearmen
[4:51:21] <ExpressNode> She can summon her harem at any time
[4:51:26] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> the skeletons don't ksis because fromsoft is gutless cowards
[4:51:30] <adithehella> they clink teeth
[4:51:31] <Hoaxfish> they have skeletongues
[4:51:33] <jubejube56> The archer went melee too at least
[4:51:37] <guffbud> Not with that attitude
[4:51:41] <+Zeromaru2> Why are the arrows so good against you but not against bosses? Feels like an oversight
[4:51:41] <ergulor> they have pretty hair tho
[4:51:45] <TheDeimion> oh
[4:51:46] <adithehella> oh wow
[4:51:50] <penitentpendant> They ressing though
[4:51:51] <TheDeimion> well....
[4:51:52] <%tusk102> they get back up though
[4:51:54] <@TheYellowcouch> but they're still on the list
[4:51:55] <%LorcaNomad> but then got back up :)
[4:51:57] <@Ranryu692> skeletons are the only things with less lips than Odo
[4:52:00] <%josnotforlewd> heeeeyoo
[4:52:00] <MaybeFalco> pat i dont think its weak to holy
[4:52:01] <ape_hawk> pat, jellyfish, try it
[4:52:01] <propmaster256> lol
[4:52:01] <%tusk102> OLEGGGGGG
[4:52:03] <penitentpendant> Oleg has the best uptime
[4:52:05] <TheDeimion> as long as they aren't hit while down they'll come back LUL
[4:52:05] <+MorelK> Good old Oleg
[4:52:11] <MaritimeSpanker> oho man
[4:52:14] <propmaster256> Hahaha
[4:52:16] <Nuke_Zack> I love oleg he takes so long to die
[4:52:16] <%thbluewarden> the goblins did pretty well.
[4:52:19] <luciluxlu0> just got to level it up.
[4:52:23] <%Mister_McDerp> if only Oleg could get back up
[4:52:25] <%tetraes> i feel like it isnt fair to compare unupgraded spirits to Oleg
[4:52:29] <guffbud> Your best shot was with monkey men so far
[4:52:35] <%tusk102> lmao
[4:52:36] <TheDeimion> nice LUL
[4:52:36] <%FacetiousAF> first try
[4:52:36] <sirjames079> LMAO
[4:52:36] <%josnotforlewd> nice
[4:52:37] <ape_hawk> PERFECT
[4:52:37] <adithehella> unfortunate
[4:52:38] <%slandracon> wow
[4:52:39] <mrapplebucks> nice
[4:52:39] <@Ranryu692> if Odo wanted to, though, he could be only lips
[4:52:40] <penitentpendant> I find it funny how popular the Jellyfish summon has become
[4:52:41] <binku_muja_> F-ck. That one hit kill is rough.
[4:52:42] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[4:52:43] <%Tearonex> you did it LUL
[4:52:50] <Gray_LoFi> Fumble equipment around to see if you can setup so you don't get one-hit?
[4:52:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt to be fair the skeletons are unupgraded
[4:52:53] <TheDeimion> I knew you could LUL
[4:52:57] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Hey guys, I still love these games, but you've at least got to admit that as talented as they are, they Reeeeeally need to cool it with the berserk references and recycling of game mechanics
[4:52:58] <radiorosewater> know what i mean
[4:52:59] <sweatch0> god i wish that were me
[4:53:00] <chowndawg> I just noticed but this guy has a dragon god mouth
[4:53:02] <sirjames079> See kids, this is why don't fight a berserk Eva unit
[4:53:05] <radiorosewater> perfect
[4:53:05] <FeralFozzie> not exactly what i'd call progress but as long as your happy
[4:53:08] <wolfs_x> odo had lips to kiss with smh
[4:53:11] <%FacetiousAF> oh i loved loop hero Kappa
[4:53:14] <Landedx> big brain plays
[4:53:16] <%Monkeyweed21> if you embered up would you be able to survive a hit?
[4:53:23] <+zac_nap94> ember up?
[4:53:40] <%slandracon> Just realized Oleg is a Stormveil knight with his wind attacks @patstaresat
[4:53:40] <TheDeimion> there's a really horrible sorcerer that might scale crazy good like the ladle if you level the summon up, but unconfirmed
[4:53:44] <XxMoliciousxX> that thing looks like a street shark
[4:53:49] <MaritimeSpanker> what
[4:53:56] <MaritimeSpanker> it looks like you SHOULD be able to
[4:53:57] <TheDeimion> maybe it's just really good damage opportunity?
[4:54:00] <penitentpendant> Huh
[4:54:01] <+mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt have you tried Jellyfish bro?
[4:54:03] <TheDeimion> it be weird
[4:54:04] <sirjames079> You're actually doing really good damage on him he just hits so fucking hard
[4:54:05] <%sniffy77> i feel like just hitting him when he reposes does more damage
[4:54:06] <%FacetiousAF> maybe you need an onion bro
[4:54:07] <propmaster256> big flail
[4:54:07] <CrunchyPoopSoup> Paige NO
[4:54:13] <luciluxlu0> I think you should get lightning spear
[4:54:17] <TheDeimion> just mash R1 4head
[4:54:19] <TheDeimion> 4Head
[4:54:21] <ape_hawk> paige, stop upsetting dog
[4:54:25] <Gorgs7> it's upsetting me and I can't even see it
[4:54:25] <adithehella> maybe directly in front?
[4:54:29] <digaogrunge> The GIT GUD dance
[4:54:36] <+ajeanstarks78 > have you tried using the Marika shackles on other enemies?
[4:54:42] <blanknum> this is the midir of Elden ring isn't it
[4:54:43] <%Monkeyweed21> you would have enough faith if you embered
[4:54:43] <binku_muja_> Just noticed that Pat's playing elden ring while woolie's busy playing KOF. LUL
[4:54:52] <TheDeimion> yikes
[4:55:03] <Ner234> FOOD
[4:55:06] <%LorcaNomad> LUL silly boy
[4:55:06] <penitentpendant> Gief: "FUD!"
[4:55:08] <tanarath> Because it DID
[4:55:08] <thegingeinthenorth> maximum overdrive
[4:55:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @staticmouth2 no thats the dragon bosses in the overworld
[4:55:08] <sirjames079> Looks like that forward swipe is his most dangerous attack
[4:55:09] <wolfs_x> doge.... cursed
[4:55:14] <+spacepiratezod> You could Torrent around him for extra mobility
[4:55:17] <+mrjplays2k9> hes aware of whats in there
[4:55:17] <%Mister_McDerp> what a fatty
[4:55:19] <thesaverofhumens> LUL
[4:55:24] <luciluxlu0> there is a lightning spear with less faith that works like the og lightning spear
[4:55:27] <SadisticAphid60> i wonder if this guy will drop a dragon thing
[4:55:27] <cosmicgoatee> Zangeif, Elden Lord of the Fridge
[4:55:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Gwen Stefani raised that dog
[4:55:34] <TheDeimion> I mean bananas are pretty hype spaceyeenTheBanana
[4:55:35] <zanzibarian_hamster> Stop giving him scraps then
[4:55:37] <binku_muja_> Food supersedes anything and everything Pat. Especially with dogs.
[4:55:38] <jbrachob> Is he secretly Donkeykong?
[4:55:39] <ergulor> renanem him banana then
[4:55:39] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ranryu692 My bad for replying so late, but u got me there dude
[4:55:43] <zanzibarian_hamster> ah the damage is probably done
[4:55:54] <penitentpendant> Try and Horse the boss?
[4:55:57] <cosmicgoatee> lmao
[4:55:59] <%gitgouda> lol
[4:56:00] <TheDeimion> don't worry about that 4Head
[4:56:00] <Macguffn> looks like ankles is the way to go for that boss
[4:56:01] <propmaster256> HAH, the boss saw you were still barely alive and went "oops, sorry"
[4:56:02] <thesaverofhumens> Kappa
[4:56:03] <CrunchyPoopSoup> you know exactly why
[4:56:04] <ape_hawk> you know why
[4:56:06] <$vehementvadr> pat this dragon man would
[4:56:07] <penitentpendant> Well, Hoat the boss
[4:56:08] <Sunstalker> Why don't you, Pat?
[4:56:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> KappaPride
[4:56:15] <sweatch0> jmikeRat2
[4:56:15] <%Deft_Thought> The way Gief acts, you'd think he's never had food before
[4:56:16] <%Mister_McDerp> how can one pigdog be so hungry?
[4:56:21] <guffbud> I’d be happy to just watch Oleg 1 v 1 this boss
[4:56:22] <TheDeimion> ya exactly @Sunstalker

[4:56:26] <Landedx> feel like the mobs almost did better
[4:56:28] <thesaverofhumens> horse would get you killed
[4:56:29] <penitentpendant> An attempt was made!
[4:56:32] <binku_muja_> the mob summon seemed to keep the boss distracted for longer while you got your hits in.
[4:56:32] <TheDeimion> that's the question Pat should ask themself 4Head
[4:56:34] <%LorcaNomad> TORRENT NO! D:
[4:56:35] <Rbeatononefour> you were a *little* close there, Pat
[4:56:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> just smack him with your sword more
[4:56:36] <tanarath> spaceyeenTheBanana @patstaresat
[4:56:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> foolproof strat
[4:56:39] <HeroToxiko> it is what it is
[4:56:42] <luciluxlu0> the 17faith lightning spear made it easier. but you don't have it yet
[4:56:45] <sirjames079> There's an advantage, but on horse you have to do extreme hit and run
[4:56:47] <wolfs_x> the demi humans were best kiting
[4:56:50] <Flame_Water> turned your house into glue
[4:56:52] <TheDeimion> you couldn't torrent the boss :<
[4:57:01] <TheDeimion> the file size 2 big
[4:57:08] <TheDeimion> SURVIVED !?
[4:57:11] <luciluxlu0> Liurnia
[4:57:13] <TheDeimion> PogChamp
[4:57:13] <Zourath> Seems like a horse boss for range-focused builds, not one for melee.
[4:57:17] <HeroToxiko> is wretch the best to start if i like suffering for a bit and having every possible advantage later?
[4:57:17] <42nfl19> WAIT SURVIVED?
[4:57:18] <Landedx> that was a sentence
[4:57:21] <radiorosewater> at ligma
[4:57:21] <42nfl19> 2 HITS
[4:57:23] <binku_muja_> Magic pixel of health. VoteYea
[4:57:32] <+mrjplays2k9> Jelly-bro is the answer to all problems
[4:57:35] <radiorosewater> ligma deez nutz
[4:57:39] <wolfs_x> instant death attacks ):
[4:57:44] <sirjames079> I hate fighting these big fuckers where a casual step takes them out of your hit range
[4:57:44] <TheDeimion> he has no guts, can't stab there
[4:57:45] <ape_hawk> use jelly and tank
[4:57:46] <42nfl19> oh one hit
[4:57:49] <thesaverofhumens> just need patience :)
[4:57:50] <propmaster256> damn dude, this boss is rough
[4:57:51] <grimmlight013> This... seems.... interesting
[4:57:51] <%LorcaNomad> wow he really didn't want you stabbing his leg
[4:57:52] <Rbeatononefour> i'd still try Torrent - just give him a chance to chill between attacks!
[4:57:53] <CrunchyPoopSoup> dragonborn too stronk
[4:57:56] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt have you found any faith based weapons? ive only found one so far and i want to do a faith build.
[4:57:59] <binku_muja_> Wait, what was different about that hit you survived compared to that last one?
[4:58:00] <radiorosewater> jeollo fishie
[4:58:01] <guffbud> Just swing don’t be fancy
[4:58:03] <XxMoliciousxX> get in his belly!
[4:58:11] <radiorosewater> jely fiush
[4:58:14] <luciluxlu0> North Eastern part of Liurnia has fire and lightning miracles
[4:58:31] <sirjames079> Can you bait out that big overhead?
[4:58:33] <%sniffy77> this guy looks like he needs a snickers
[4:58:33] <grimmlight013> He legit oneshots you
[4:58:39] <ape_hawk> jump attack his hand when he slam
[4:58:40] <%OrangeMDT> Your damage is pretty good for a souls-like game. It’s just patience and rolling that’s needed, since you basically can’t get hit
[4:58:41] <Macguffn> boss suceptible to bleed?
[4:58:44] <radiorosewater> jelklfiesh
[4:58:45] <Frranky> i'm a dragonkin soldier i already told ya
[4:58:48] <%josnotforlewd> lettuce see da jellyfish
[4:59:04] <SadisticAphid60> perhaps this would be easier with magic
[4:59:07] <TheDeimion> you could also bait it to pursue and it does a sprawling pursuit move that you can punish if you dodge it
[4:59:14] <thesaverofhumens> think of this as a no-damage run Kappa
[4:59:18] <radiorosewater> bynashed night olugg
[4:59:22] <+ajeanstarks78 > pat have you tried the spell you used on margit to pin them to the floor
[4:59:30] <TheDeimion> maaaaash
[4:59:35] <TheDeimion> yeeeee
[4:59:40] <TheDeimion> you got it now
[4:59:43] <TheDeimion> LOOK OUT
[4:59:46] <SadisticAphid60> shields are for weaklings
[4:59:47] <%FacetiousAF> BULLSHIT
[4:59:47] <%josnotforlewd> lmao
[4:59:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe change your flask around so that you use the damage reduction one instead of regen since you'll die in one hit anyways.
[4:59:49] <+itsanonbunny> damn that was close
[4:59:50] <thegingeinthenorth> close!
[4:59:52] <wolfs_x> was that an AOE
[4:59:52] <+Saggitori> he forgets every time
[4:59:52] <CrunchyPoopSoup> damn almost
[4:59:53] <thesaverofhumens> you're really close
[4:59:58] <%sniffy77> gotta watch the take out exposion
[4:59:58] <+BigBusinessKaiju> LUL LUL
[5:00:00] <penitentpendant> Haven't seen the attack enough times to internalize it
[5:00:02] <guffbud> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[5:00:02] <$vehementvadr> his a r m was in the ground
[5:00:06] <NeoseekerStitch> Boomerang ground smash. :P
[5:00:07] <TheDeimion> oh he hasn't done the AOE explosion move yet LUL
[5:00:07] <%FacetiousAF> two more lets go Kappa
[5:00:08] <+mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt Im the guy that gave the cheeky parry advice day 1, my new advice is to check out daddy jellyfish
[5:00:13] <BlueBiscuitGT> almost, found the right ritm
[5:00:16] <thesaverofhumens> @Sigma_190_Beta he'd have to find his way back to a grace first then come back
[5:00:17] <%scarman125> that's like the third time you've fallen for that move LUL
[5:00:17] <TomahawkSandwich> orb rubs for luck
[5:00:19] <binku_muja_> Does anyone know why won't it let Pat pop the glowing eye?
[5:00:20] <TheDeimion> he's like those golems from DKS1 in the forest
[5:00:22] <radiorosewater> PJSalt woolieGIRLS
[5:00:25] <sweatch0> this boss is full of cum
[5:00:25] <digaogrunge> wasaup with the critical not connecting?
[5:00:29] <TheDeimion> but that's his whole moveset now
[5:00:32] <guffbud> Jelly is best summon
[5:00:35] <Guardiansaiyan> Gotta work...see evryone later! or VOD
[5:00:39] <TheDeimion> it's ez now
[5:00:40] <it_came_from_outer_space> MAYBE @PatStaresAt this would be a cool time to try the great rune
[5:00:42] <Guardiansaiyan> VirtualHug VirtualHug
[5:00:46] <%JoshManVGH> So it looks like the game doesn't let you replace Ashes of War on unique weapons. It's nice that you can't fuck up boss weapons but also kinda sad due to passives.
[5:00:48] <%FacetiousAF> :/
[5:00:52] <penitentpendant> Slamwiched
[5:01:04] <+dearghostss> yeah pat try jellyfish
[5:01:06] <Rbeatononefour> his legs are p vulnerable, eh
[5:01:08] <sirjames079> His attacks come out so fast for how strong they are
[5:01:17] <penitentpendant> This smells like a job for DETERMINATION
[5:01:23] <+AngryHomunculus> I keep thinking you're doing the finger wqhistle from Sekiro
[5:01:30] <%JoshManVGH> I gotta find another dex great sword with bleed now... how hard could that be.
[5:01:33] <radiorosewater> prserverraymynt
[5:01:42] <%slandracon> Bleed? @patstaresat
[5:01:44] <%FacetiousAF> hmm.
[5:01:47] <%FacetiousAF> maybe not that
[5:01:47] <T_Sasquatch> God i cant wait to play this game
[5:01:48] <binku_muja_> I guess we should be grateful that there aren't archer enemies taking pot shots during the boss fight. You know the mf's considered it.
[5:01:52] <guffbud> As your getting 1 shot anyway why not take off the armour to get a quick roll?
[5:01:52] <sirjames079> Yeeeeeeeeah his belly is a bad place to be
[5:01:55] <TheDeimion> gotta keep at the side cuz there's no belly hitbox at all
[5:02:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mummies Don't Bleed
[5:02:07] <thesaverofhumens> he can do it with his current strat he just needs to be patient
[5:02:09] <FeralFozzie> your magic sword is no match for his toddler tantrum
[5:02:09] <AgnusLaplace> has he tried not getting hit?
[5:02:10] <penitentpendant> @JoshManVGH I mean, you can MAKE weapons 'bleed weapons' now so it shouldn't be too bad
[5:02:13] <Frranky> yeah this is really just a hit it and don't get hit boss
[5:02:14] <nabonidus3> is Pat str or dex?
[5:02:15] <%OrangeMDT> He got no guts man. No need to go there
[5:02:19] <ExpressNode> The belly is empty because the cockpit was ejected
[5:02:21] <TheDeimion> that's cool they have that detail but man
[5:02:22] <+BigBusinessKaiju> LUL
[5:02:24] <penitentpendant> Oof
[5:02:24] <%FacetiousAF> best run so far
[5:02:24] <thesaverofhumens> @nabonidus3 str/faith
[5:02:29] <BlueBiscuitGT> I think you shouldn't jump attack from the front, that belt thing doesn't have a hit box, damn got ninjaed
[5:02:30] <z_mad_j> the dead don't bleed they die lol
[5:02:30] <Rbeatononefour> go for the Feet
[5:02:37] <nabonidus3> @nabonidus3 ty
[5:02:38] <Frranky> bleed's not going to do much more than he's already doing, the damage is good
[5:02:39] <T_Sasquatch> There's so much shit im seeing for the first time and im watching various playthroughs
[5:02:40] <%JoshManVGH> @penitentpendant Say more words please, how do?
[5:02:41] <sirjames079> What a fun hitbox that is
[5:02:42] <elfranco001> LUL
[5:02:45] <+TheMeromex> maybe dont go straight at him?
[5:02:48] <TheDeimion> makes the tried and true method of just stay under it a detriment
[5:02:52] <brunoberserk> so Pat already know about that Smash is out of EVO ?
[5:02:59] <XxMoliciousxX> you need like a javlin missile launcher
[5:03:01] <jubejube56> Okay so what is the lore behind the dragon kin soldier
[5:03:04] <radiorosewater> have you tried using the fish when it gives you something for a damage value when it's in between to areas of the map when you need it the most. you know that i really think you should
[5:03:09] <+NotaryRotary> Dayuuuum
[5:03:11] <thesaverofhumens> he's weak to being killed
[5:03:12] <penitentpendant> @JoshManVGH There's an ash of war that transforms normal weapons into bleed weapons (Which seems to scale with arcane)
[5:03:18] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[5:03:21] <+mrjplays2k9> the unlearning has begun
[5:03:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Somebody fucked a dragon
[5:03:21] <ape_hawk> and youre weak to getting slapped
[5:03:26] <z_mad_j> why not wait to see what moves he has
[5:03:30] <XxMoliciousxX> dragonkin, weak to lightning?
[5:03:32] <cosmicgoatee> come on and slam and welcome to the jam
[5:03:35] <SadisticAphid60> get behind him and tickle his toes
[5:03:40] <it_came_from_outer_space> You can do it
[5:03:42] <TheDeimion> big dragon man viciously elbowdrops small redhead live on stream 4Head
[5:03:43] <z_mad_j> I believe yah
[5:03:46] <+itsanonbunny> ddg;ajg;ajga
[5:03:49] <CrunchyPoopSoup> this thing farts and you die
[5:03:51] <@TheYellowcouch> I can do this
[5:03:52] <%slandracon> You do have the enhanced jump slash charm @patstaresat
[5:03:52] <cosmicgoatee> Kappa
[5:03:53] <+LazyAss24Seven> da backahdn
[5:03:53] <z_mad_j> nvm I don't
[5:03:58] <penitentpendant> @JoshManVGH So any normal greatsword with that ash should make a 'bleed greatsword'
[5:04:00] <wolfs_x> he's gotten close
[5:04:01] <odnucaf3> CT activate!
[5:04:03] <%OrangeMDT> Pat seeks the absent orb
[5:04:08] <MaritimeSpanker> imagine if he drops nothing
[5:04:10] <chowndawg> equip heavier gear
[5:04:15] <+BigBusinessKaiju> You keep slamming your head into a wall Pat, you can do it.
[5:04:16] <radiorosewater> SHIT YOURSELF
[5:04:16] <sirjames079> *The Beast II plays sadly*
[5:04:21] <radiorosewater> YOU WOULDNT\
[5:04:34] <z_mad_j> yah it sucks when you have them almost dead then you can never get back there for so long
[5:04:38] <XxMoliciousxX> do you slow down if you're wearing heavy armor on torrent?
[5:04:40] <AgnusLaplace> just don't get hit
[5:04:42] <+Zeromaru2> @MaritimeSpanker I think Pat would die
[5:04:49] <binku_muja_> @slandracon wouldn't that would leave him vulnerable to being backhanded?
[5:05:04] <z_mad_j> git gud bra
[5:05:08] <z_mad_j> lol jk
[5:05:08] <+ithonmage> does the dragon cannon shooting under his belly work, just curious for those who've tried
[5:05:10] <Rbeatononefour> stay on his back-side imo
[5:05:10] <+BoboDaHobo> quit going for his guts
[5:05:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> It's whatever side he isn't swinging with
[5:05:27] <thesaverofhumens> the loading screens have a lot of spoilers don't they
[5:05:27] <Macguffn> get that dragonkin booty!
[5:05:28] <TheDeimion> ya the drgn doesn't seem to back out as much around the right
[5:05:29] <guffbud> Try without Oleg so he doesn’t move as much?
[5:05:29] <radiorosewater> move the left stick
[5:05:36] <+mrjplays2k9> approach his angus
[5:05:38] <%SABiscotti> seems like the most dangerous move while on the right side is when he draws his hand towards him
[5:05:42] <Irishgamerlawd> looks more like a kaiju
[5:05:52] <TheDeimion> also keeping hiim between you and a summon should help
[5:06:07] <sirjames079> Where's the Ultraman summon when you need him
[5:06:10] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt there's a cheese you can do that mostly works if you wanna know
[5:06:13] <binku_muja_> does he do a kickback attack or a sweep if you manage to stay behind him? Anyone know?
[5:06:13] <lockhead45> bleed?
[5:06:17] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt You have powerful weapons, but a weak body.
[5:06:24] <Warstar696> This is the real nightmare

[5:06:29] <z_mad_j> no bleed
[5:06:30] <+mrjplays2k9> the roll spam
[5:06:30] <it_came_from_outer_space> I really do believe that popping a rune arc on this guy would make a lot of difference
[5:06:32] <ape_hawk> no
[5:06:32] <Rbeatononefour> strafing his rear with Torrent would work i think?
[5:06:34] <it_came_from_outer_space> since it gives hp
[5:06:35] <TheDeimion> It is really cool the way the claws scrape across the ground
[5:06:39] <ape_hawk> thinking is for nerds
[5:06:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> JellyFish
[5:06:42] <radiorosewater> do dragons have a cloaca?
[5:06:42] <%za7az> Is a ranged battle an option?
[5:06:43] <cosmicgoatee> crazy talk activating mid battle animation
[5:06:48] <TioXyco> think hurt head, me no want
[5:06:51] <thesaverofhumens> maybe do faster attacks to whittle him down instead of the big ones
[5:06:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> ARCHERS
[5:06:58] <Macguffn> given the HUGE range and area of his flailing, are the summons causing more problems than they are solving?
[5:06:58] <TheDeimion> just need to be patient and note the swipes
[5:07:01] <XxMoliciousxX> I dunno summon like 5 mages??
[5:07:03] <z_mad_j> I want to say maybe
[5:07:04] <+PesterChunklage> well that looks LEnGThY
[5:07:10] <TheDeimion> ooooo
[5:07:10] <$vehementvadr> I think this guy is a physical representation of what the path of the dragon arts does to you
[5:07:15] <%tusk102> yo that did a bit of damage
[5:07:16] <jubejube56> Just respec to a sorcerer :p
[5:07:18] <sweatch0> do the secret big backflip move into a swandive and do your special uppercut
[5:07:25] <Warstar696> Fucker is uglier than my last physical exam
[5:07:26] <guffbud> One hit dodge reset
[5:07:29] <penitentpendant> Not bad damage, but the animation lock seems too dangerous for that attack
[5:07:30] <%tusk102> YOU BLEW IT
[5:07:32] <TioXyco> up close it kinda is, but up close is also kinda dangerous
[5:07:35] <z_mad_j> wow bs
[5:07:37] <%PesterChunklage> PesterChunklage subscribed with Prime. 
[5:07:39] <Warstar696> F
[5:07:40] <+MorelK> got too excited
[5:07:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you have to stand still for a second
[5:07:50] <z_mad_j> you have to stop pat
[5:07:50] <TheDeimion> maybe it doesn't stab?
[5:07:50] <penitentpendant> Can you riposte if you're not locked on?
[5:07:51] <Rbeatononefour> maybe its bugged, who knows
[5:07:51] <%za7az> Maybe from the very front?
[5:07:51] <cosmicgoatee> keeps getting caught in the sweep
[5:07:55] <ape_hawk> pat, just cheese him with magic from far away
[5:07:59] <Irishgamerlawd> Jump??
[5:08:01] <penitentpendant> I know you can backstab, at least
[5:08:09] <%PesterChunklage> Get up in his balls
[5:08:12] <TheDeimion> oh maybe jump attack?
[5:08:13] <radiorosewater> @PatStaresAt you have to smack the cloaca
[5:08:16] <Irishgamerlawd> Jumpy visceral
[5:08:20] <+BoboDaHobo> gotta be in the right spot and not moving I think, its way too finnicky though
[5:08:22] <Warstar696> But he has no balls
[5:08:25] <BonsLaBons> Does the glowing eye have a separate lock on @patstaresat
[5:08:27] <penitentpendant> Pat has chosen the path of Faith, not cheese
[5:08:33] <ape_hawk> the magic you were using before
[5:08:39] <z_mad_j> some bosses attack based on what you are or not doing lol because you close slam town
[5:08:47] <TheDeimion> it could be you jumpattack it?
[5:08:47] <radiorosewater> pat use the choese
[5:08:51] <%blankwaffle> can you Dodge on horseback?
[5:08:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat kinda killed the sorcercy teacher
[5:08:56] <ape_hawk> it doesnt have to be a short fight all the time
[5:09:02] <zanzibarian_hamster> theres those clothes that give faith]
[5:09:03] <XxMoliciousxX> you need Unit02 to stop Unit01
[5:09:06] <Warstar696> @Pookiedaexzile he did what.
[5:09:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> lol
[5:09:23] <cosmicgoatee> lmaooo
[5:09:24] <ape_hawk> okay
[5:09:25] <Shpee_Crayb> Someone said you have to stand still for a second before you can do the stab.
[5:09:29] <binku_muja_> BibleThump
[5:09:31] <%PesterChunklage> can you parry the first swing
[5:09:32] <Kale_Chip> yeah too slow windup there
[5:09:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> elbow'd
[5:09:34] <penitentpendant> @Warstar696 She was bound to a wall so he tried to stab her free
[5:09:35] <Rbeatononefour> his legs do nothing
[5:09:44] <z_mad_j> yep sound legit
[5:09:47] <TheDeimion> I don't think you can LUL
[5:09:48] <it_came_from_outer_space> doubt it, this guy is QUITE large
[5:09:50] <z_mad_j> no balls
[5:09:52] <Warstar696> @penitentpendant well then.
[5:10:00] <Irishgamerlawd> Maybe mounted combat?
[5:10:01] <Kale_Chip> maybe come
[5:10:03] <%SWFanatic> hmm
[5:10:04] <Kale_Chip> ack
[5:10:04] <%PesterChunklage> if you can it might give enough to cast cuz closing in might be dangerous
[5:10:08] <jbrachob> try dodging
[5:10:08] <XxMoliciousxX> try to make a rudimentary lathe
[5:10:08] <+BoboDaHobo> guard counter works though
[5:10:10] <+StallionPupper> stay on the horse maybe?
[5:10:14] <jubejube56> Oh right before I think you were able to get more free hits in by summoning from far away then closing the gap fast with torrent
[5:10:15] <xxHungryxx> Damn. just ONE hit
[5:10:16] <cosmicgoatee> Pat, you can always put a pin in this boss and come back later Kappa
[5:10:17] <Kale_Chip> maybe come back with a hit more health?
[5:10:17] <guffbud> Swing less more often
[5:10:19] <jubejube56> Like when it started
[5:10:20] <chowndawg> you need to be able to survive one hit
[5:10:23] <$Smokay17> Does your sword still have the magic slash?
[5:10:29] <+BoboDaHobo> you need poise then damn
[5:10:38] <@Ranryu692> I suppose coming back later with enough health to not get one-shot isn't an option?
[5:10:39] <TioXyco> what about the Storm... something Ash of War?
[5:10:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> You can see the other side of the Dragonkussy from his stomach, unpleasant
[5:10:46] <TheDeimion> U FUCKING WUT M8!?
[5:10:47] <%SWFanatic> thats good dmg
[5:10:48] <binku_muja_> Yes! finally!
[5:10:49] <jbrachob> what about black flame?
[5:10:49] <TheDeimion> LUL
[5:10:51] <Warstar696> Big damage
[5:10:52] <radiorosewater> @PatStaresAt you could switch up your physik for the damage reduction, health regen isn't helping here
[5:10:53] <penitentpendant> Well, it worked that time at least
[5:10:56] <DestroPrime83> wow twitches compression fucking hates Dark SOuls music
[5:10:57] <XxMoliciousxX> lol maybe you're supposed to plunge attack him from a ledge
[5:11:19] <%SWFanatic> thats doable
[5:11:19] <binku_muja_> BS!
[5:11:20] <Warstar696> Ground flailing shoryuken
[5:11:21] <Macguffn> his size and posture form an optical illusion so you keep swinging at nothing
[5:11:24] <TheDeimion> was that a parry!?
[5:11:26] <DestroPrime83> Jesus its like im listening through a staticy radio
[5:11:29] <+mrjplays2k9> I think horse battle is best for this
[5:11:33] <TioXyco> will it?
[5:11:33] <jbrachob> Is...is that the inside of his butthole?
[5:11:39] <+BoboDaHobo> maybe its a fight you're supposed to lose? LUL
[5:11:39] <AgnusLaplace> that was bs, lmao
[5:11:45] <xxHungryxx> What if he drops nothing?
[5:11:50] <chowndawg> cut his tail off
[5:11:54] <%FacetiousAF> greed
[5:11:59] <chowndawg> lol
[5:12:07] <cosmicgoatee> Dragon deez
[5:12:07] <Shpee_Crayb> yeah but what if
[5:12:08] <penitentpendant> I mean, all bosses give runes regardless
[5:12:08] <XxMoliciousxX> he's too big to tell what he's doing at all times
[5:12:08] <DestroPrime83> Pat what are you using to capture game audio?
[5:12:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> Maybe you have to lose 100 times, then he dies to the cold... like Midir?
[5:12:17] <guffbud> Take 1 less swing
[5:12:22] <tolloponik> for some reason I keep anticipating monster hunter a stun roar from him
[5:12:30] <+tempestzephyr> it's fine
[5:12:32] <sirjames079> Sounds fine to me
[5:12:33] <DegenCat> maybe you could befriend him by giving him a stomach and liver
[5:12:35] <%Dakuu75> it is fine. ppl just need to refresh
[5:12:36] <B4k4ryuBanzai> fine crunchy garbage
[5:12:36] <tolloponik> it's mostly on twitches end
[5:12:36] <radiorosewater> you have anything that can apply DOT?
[5:12:37] <+mrjplays2k9> its the twitch compression
[5:12:38] <TheDeimion> maybe they are just trolling u
[5:12:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> dollar store headphones
[5:12:41] <lockhead45> have you tried bleed yet?
[5:12:41] <%PesterChunklage> can you go horseback after the first few hits so you can just gimp out the front attacks
[5:12:41] <adithehella> probably connection issue on their side
[5:12:42] <+AngryHomunculus> They probably have shit audio
[5:12:42] <+RyuMojo> audio is fine
[5:12:43] <radiorosewater> woolieONEGUY
[5:12:44] <daniphofani> could you come back later when you're stronger or does Pat just wanna gamer it
[5:12:45] <%SWFanatic> #justtwitchlife
[5:12:45] <+geekjacob> yeah sounds good too me
[5:12:45] <binku_muja_> Their internet is just too crunchy to process it.
[5:12:47] <$Smokay17> Get on the Hydras back SwiftRage
[5:12:47] <dmac63> Sounds fine
[5:12:48] <TheDeimion> man this dragon tho...
[5:12:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's Twitch's end @PatStaresAt
[5:12:49] <@TheYellowcouch> Crazy talk is not exclusive to you
[5:12:50] <Gorgs7> crunchy garbage coming from garbage speakers
[5:12:52] <penitentpendant> Sound's fine, some people's computers are different than others
[5:12:54] <SummonerMagno> Twitch itself do that sometimes
[5:12:55] <@StridentSong> Your audio is fine. It's probably on their end
[5:12:55] <HeroToxiko> people who need to fix their own sound setup
[5:12:56] <sirjames079> On this fight you're just gonna have to go for the long game, get one swing and dodge back out
[5:12:57] <%MelfinaStarwind> twitch garbles game audio all the time, just refresh
[5:12:57] <%LorcaNomad> twitch compression a fuck, it sounds fine
[5:12:58] <AgnusLaplace> I had to turn off low latency because the sound was crusty as fuck yesterday
[5:13:01] <Tenebrae94> @patstaresat aren't you wearing something that makes you take more damage?
[5:13:02] <%FacetiousAF> reload paige
[5:13:02] <Shpee_Crayb> It's okay, could be better though
[5:13:04] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  maybe it's on twitch's end?
[5:13:10] <Irishgamerlawd> I think its the bass they cant hear properly so it crackles
[5:13:11] <XxMoliciousxX> probably listening on airpods
[5:13:13] <%za7az> If this is just a regular ass dragon kin soldier, I'd hate to see what an elite one could do
[5:13:13] <%SWFanatic> how funky is your monkey
[5:13:15] <Ell1ot> maybe they to refresh or lowering quality
[5:13:17] <DestroPrime83> Refreshed and audio is still fucked
[5:13:17] <%PesterChunklage> mine adjusted after a minute
[5:13:17] <+mrjplays2k9> usually happens after a buffer or an ad
[5:13:19] <This_side_up_153> maybe it's just your voice lol
[5:13:22] <+geekjacob> also check the audio compressor
[5:13:28] <julrave> but Paige isn't even here how am I supposed to reload her?
[5:13:29] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck just read some news that Nvidia has been compromised.
[5:13:30] <+TheMeromex> also in twich advance settings switch the low bitrate toggle and see if its same afterwards
[5:13:38] <+AngryHomunculus> So what's the lore on this dude?
[5:13:40] <+TheMeromex> low latency i mean
[5:13:41] <+BoboDaHobo> that 10% could be the difference for surviving those swings though
[5:13:45] <DestroPrime83> Pat sounds great the games music  sounds like a bad radio
[5:13:45] <penitentpendant> Good damage
[5:13:50] <sirjames079> Oh this hitbox on that visceral is really specific
[5:13:50] <%Tadashi047> didn't you have a potion that gave you a bubble shield for a hit?
[5:13:54] <TheDeimion> nice dodge
[5:14:01] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winnin' son?
[5:14:01] <Warstar696> @ExpressNode this makes like the 10th time Nvidia's fucked up.
[5:14:03] <AgnusLaplace> phase 2 baybe
[5:14:04] <radiorosewater> woolieS woolieT
[5:14:06] <%Dakuu75> @AngryHomunculus he went horny on main, and couldn't come back
[5:14:06] <%YakumoYomi> Does shielding help at all?
[5:14:08] <Rbeatononefour> hit+run on those feet
[5:14:08] <%abakkus> startin to get the rhythm tho

[5:14:24] <@Ranryu692> I turned my volume way up and the sound of the Dragonkin moving around the water is kinda crunchy, but that's it
[5:14:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Jellyfish
[5:14:29] <binku_muja_> @AngryHomunculus not sure yet

[5:14:39] <Rbeatononefour> alright okay
[5:14:39] <ExpressNode> @Warstar696 Yeah it says it was a cyber attack but nothing yet on if customer details were leaked
[5:14:41] <jbrachob> just dig up
[5:14:46] <%blankwaffle> understandable

[5:14:51] <DestroPrime83> WAIT!!!! LOW LATENCY FUCKS |THE AUDIO???
[5:14:55] <Frranky> sometimes the answer to a souls boss is just kill it an don't get hit
[5:14:56] <Shpee_Crayb> Oh I can hear the audio come in good sometimes
[5:14:58] <+AngryHomunculus> @binku_muja_ OK thanks
[5:15:01] <MildMannered_Creighton> slapping thighs

[5:15:09] <TheDeimion> woah no
[5:15:11] <sirjames079> Stay unlocked?
[5:15:11] <Warstar696> @ExpressNode considering the last one got about 10,000 people phished... yeah, par for the course.
[5:15:15] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt btw, is there any sort of button for gestures? or you have to press start and selectr it?
[5:15:16] <DestroPrime83> Low Latency in Advance settings fucks the audio
[5:15:20] <%PesterChunklage> but yu just gotta use the old 1 2
[5:15:22] <+BoboDaHobo> insert curb song
[5:15:22] <%SWFanatic> it's fine
[5:15:23] <Shpee_Crayb> Yeah it is low latency mode hly shit
[5:15:29] <DestroPrime83> turned it off Night and Day
[5:15:32] <binku_muja_> @PesterChunklage he tried, got one shot regardless.
[5:15:33] <%MelBrooksKA> That one shot attacking seems really annoying
[5:15:34] <XxMoliciousxX> yeah see, too big to see what he's doing
[5:15:40] <Shpee_Crayb> I just turned it off aand its better
[5:16:03] <DestroPrime83> Yeaaaah turned off Low Latency and the audio is instantly better
[5:16:12] <nesbitt22> Pat has Glow Beat Stick now?
[5:16:13] <guffbud> I wonder if he’ll give a dragon heart
[5:16:21] <ExpressNode> @Warstar696 Had to delete one email because of it being in a massive breach and I don't want to fathom changing all my passwords and emails for all my accounts again
[5:16:32] <%PesterChunklage> @binku_muja_ i meant horse after the first half and just circle around

[5:18:34] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @patstaresat Congratulations on beating Grunbeld Pat!!!
[5:18:39] <@TheYellowcouch> Now put on the dragoon dive
[5:18:39] <thestoreemporium> god this game looks gorgeous
[5:18:44] <binku_muja_> @DestroPrime83 it could be connected to Vati's theory about how banjaxed reproduction in this world.
[5:18:45] <%LorcaNomad> I assume it's the same moveset as the other halberd
[5:18:45] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat have you seen that Jack from RLM is marking out super hard for this game
[5:18:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Can you put the stormcaller weapon art on it?
[5:18:48] <SadisticAphid60> apparently fists are useless so i will not be a punchy man
[5:18:49] <binku_muja_> i
[5:18:50] <+ShadowRFox> what the weapons arts?
[5:18:51] <binku_muja_> sos
[5:18:52] <Warstar696> Spin2Win
[5:19:03] <TheDeimion> it's spin
[5:19:03] <%bundle_of_herbs> does it?
[5:19:05] <guffbud> I want that
[5:19:06] <Bearheart223> Use the spineshatter dive with it!
[5:19:08] <binku_muja_> Damn it. twitchy fingers
[5:19:13] <+AngryHomunculus> Will you be able to do the weapon art?
[5:19:20] <Warstar696> @SadisticAphid60 there's only a few fist weapons, one of which is a pretty crazy dragon sock puppet
[5:19:21] <@Velyndra> help i can't stop dumping int my brain is too big to fight
[5:19:21] <+Local16> Funny thing is I just found the lightning spear
[5:19:33] <%LorcaNomad> is that an eye?
[5:19:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @SadisticAphid60 there are faith fist weapons you can find that are really good
[5:19:36] <Warstar696> More Marika lore?
[5:19:49] <+AngryHomunculus> That looks like an eye with a weird pupil
[5:19:56] <Hepathos87> thats an eyeball
[5:19:57] <TheDeimion> buffs but you take more damage LUL
[5:19:57] <Bearheart223> @Monkeyweed21 what where
[5:20:00] <adithehella> looks like eyeball
[5:20:09] <penitentpendant> Faith INTENSIFIES
[5:20:20] <nesbitt22> MAGIC MAN?
[5:20:26] <chowndawg> Lightning
[5:20:26] <thesaverofhumens> oh pat is using things that increases his damage taken thats why he dies so fast
[5:20:30] <Frranky> lllllllightning
[5:20:30] <TheDeimion> you gotta have faaaaaaaaaith
[5:20:33] <+AngryHomunculus> Wait it was Skeptic's spice?
[5:20:34] <%SWFanatic> woo
[5:20:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> No armor is needed for men of the cloth
[5:20:39] <%pinkslimegoblin> Nice
[5:20:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @Bearheart223 in roundtable hold i believe, need to beat invader there and then spend multiple stoneseal keys
[5:20:46] <+Roflapjack> Roflapjack subscribed with Prime. 
[5:20:46] <binku_muja_> lets see what the lightning attack wind up animation is like
[5:20:52] <nesbitt22> Pat becoming Zeus?
[5:21:03] <TioXyco> @thesaverofhumens that boss also had high damage, so even so the extra damage wouldn't matter LUL
[5:21:21] <it_came_from_outer_space> sick
[5:21:27] <thesaverofhumens> pat ascending
[5:21:28] <%SWFanatic> zap
[5:21:31] <binku_muja_> Ohh that's faster than I thought it would be.
[5:21:33] <%FacetiousAF> another big one psaGib
[5:21:34] <Rbeatononefour> oh, here's a test dummy
[5:21:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh that guys gonna get it
[5:21:35] <Chester_goes_Berserk> radical
[5:21:36] <%slandracon> @patstaresat you can also do that angel charge spell
[5:21:41] <penitentpendant> Huh, it's a cone
[5:21:49] <%barrakuta371> psaSun
[5:21:51] <Frranky> shock his ass
[5:22:01] <binku_muja_> magic doesn't seem to move very far. Or is it just my imagination?
[5:22:08] <SadisticAphid60> oh wow they really are all missing guts
[5:22:12] <Kale_Chip> seems to be for groups
[5:22:13] <Rbeatononefour> maybe its specifically meant for groups
[5:22:13] <XxMoliciousxX> aww it sucks
[5:22:14] <TheDeimion> I mean it's ok
[5:22:14] <@Ranryu692> probably better for crowd control
[5:22:15] <42nfl19> been in and out again, did Pat beat that giant thing in the minataur space looking place?
[5:22:17] <Saltmeisterr> lame
[5:22:18] <MaybeFalco> pat have you found the blood slash weapon art yet?
[5:22:20] <Zourath> Seems more like an AoE pack clear.
[5:22:21] <TheDeimion> maybe it's for multi
[5:22:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its better for mobs
[5:22:23] <guffbud> Not great
[5:22:26] <Warstar696> @binku_muja_ nope, most of them are fairly short ranged.
[5:22:28] <%Bloomingzonda> That seems worse than edge lord fire
[5:22:28] <penitentpendant> So non-charge version versus single targets then
[5:22:29] <Gray_LoFi> Maybe for spamming the noncharged version?
[5:22:30] <binku_muja_> So it's a crowd control method?
[5:22:40] <it_came_from_outer_space> what level is your talisman?
[5:22:40] <%LorcaNomad> how far is the range?
[5:22:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also remember you talisman scales with Strength.
[5:22:52] <TheDeimion> need something like the clay men to test out on
[5:22:53] <%Monkeyweed21> the thrown spear would be what you use for single targets
[5:22:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Little dick Lightning
[5:23:02] <Rbeatononefour> DAME DA NE
[5:23:02] <%SWFanatic> knowing is half the battle
[5:23:08] <Kale_Chip> oh wait can you use the tail attack now?
[5:23:10] <MaritimeSpanker> @PatStaresAt you can use the tail now though, right?
[5:23:13] <nesbitt22> Bogus
[5:23:13] <%Monkeyweed21> not until you get to the fire resistant enemies
[5:23:16] <MaritimeSpanker> and the shoulder stab you got from that knight?
[5:23:20] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat that spell kind of makes you look like Jubilee
[5:23:26] <Macguffn> Not even enough power to fully charge my cellphone
[5:23:31] <+TheRagabash> its okay Pat, you can find other, better arcane substances to throw at your enemies
[5:23:33] <%PesterChunklage> how mind gobliny is the game so far
[5:23:37] <XxMoliciousxX> maybe have to wear all that FTH damage gear
[5:23:40] <binku_muja_> @Warstar696 that sucks to hear, but i suppose it prevents cheesing. Although being a squishy magic user that takes pot shots is kind of the point.
[5:23:42] <radiorosewater> still using beast talisman?
[5:23:51] <Warstar696> @PesterChunklage HIGHLY.
[5:23:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> Where to now Patron?
[5:23:57] <jubejube56> Oh there is an option to talk to Melina
[5:24:01] <jubejube56> Was curious about that
[5:24:27] <penitentpendant> PunchWizarding continues!
[5:24:29] <%SWFanatic> use ittttt
[5:24:32] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going?
[5:24:32] <@Ranryu692> "My, Grandma, what big glasses you have!" "The better to (x) Glass Him with, my dear"
[5:24:34] <%PesterChunklage> @Warstar696 thats terrifying
[5:24:45] <%DeadlyPeaks> Is no shield viable in this game?
[5:24:52] <XxMoliciousxX> better range too
[5:24:55] <%Monkeyweed21> not gonna try the crucible spells?
[5:25:07] <%Dakuu75> yeah, I play no-shield samurai
[5:25:11] <thesaverofhumens> @DeadlyPeaks just need to be good at dodging
[5:25:12] <@TheYellowcouch> I no shield it. Just Zwei and kill
[5:25:14] <Warstar696> @binku_muja_ magic damage scaling is a bit better than expected though, at least most of these spells are actually useful.
[5:25:17] <%LazyBumNetwork> We still doing buff mage?
[5:25:24] <%Monkeyweed21> guard counters make two handing WAY better
[5:25:29] <%BlondieFDM> I've been using only the Bloodhound Fang so far. Really love the teleport attack you can do with it
[5:25:36] <+twdlrr> now I'm just wondering what's taking all of the big dude's organs
[5:25:47] <%DeadlyPeaks> Good to know!
[5:25:50] <MaritimeSpanker> please go calid
[5:25:52] <razieltano123> Calyd
[5:25:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> CAELID YEYEYE!
[5:25:56] <TheDeimion> the holy magic looks sick af tho I'll never use it
[5:25:58] <%PesterChunklage> PAT YOURE SKIPPING ALL THE GEORGE RR MARTIN POINTLESS DIALOGUE
[5:25:59] <binku_muja_> @Warstar696 so range has been sacrificed for damage in terms of magic builds this time around?
[5:26:01] <Hepathos87> fuckforrest
[5:26:02] <%Puhff> Liurnia
[5:26:02] <%HiroProtagonest> I vote Liurnia
[5:26:05] <%Bloomingzonda> Bloodhound Fang is great. Discovery Channel was a fun song
[5:26:10] <Warstar696> @binku_muja_ looks like it, yes
[5:26:27] <Rbeatononefour> Liurnia did seem like the next area - we left Godrick's castle to it
[5:26:30] <Saltmeisterr> Poll it pat
[5:26:31] <radiorosewater> caelid is good pick, you have fire stuff
[5:26:31] <%SABiscotti> Caelid
[5:26:31] <Warstar696> @binku_muja_ also there's a great deal more AoE capabilities
[5:26:32] <BlueBiscuitGT> Rot land!

[5:26:41] <+Freaknick1> Liurnia
[5:26:41] <+beavnation> this
[5:26:41] <Gray_LoFi> You have a teleport near the Caelid map so probably Caelid
[5:26:44] <TheDeimion> LUL wanna go to the eclipse zone?
[5:26:44] <MaritimeSpanker> My vote for Caelid still stands
[5:26:45] <Chester_goes_Berserk> caelid
[5:26:45] <%PesterChunklage> hey he didnt wrote like a napkins worth you gotta savour it
[5:26:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> SWAMP SWAMP SWAMP

[5:26:48] <%Mister_McDerp> lIURNIA
[5:26:49] <cosmicgoatee> i despise these crows
[5:26:50] <%za7az> LUL
[5:26:50] <%abakkus> caelid has some fucked up looking monsters so i vote caelid
[5:26:53] <Warstar696> What the fuck are those
[5:26:55] <Foxchad> caleid, it has weird birds
[5:26:55] <penitentpendant> Muppets are bigger than you think
[5:26:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> And much bigger
[5:26:56] <@Ranryu692> and much bigger
[5:26:56] <dan_g_v> close
[5:26:58] <%HiroProtagonest> Bird not for scale
[5:27:01] <LordFalara> ohhh bird for scale
[5:27:01] <MaybeFalco> i personally say caelid, but its definitely a bitch to go through
[5:27:01] <guffbud> Rot town ftw
[5:27:02] <binku_muja_> Why does this area look like it's been strip mined?
[5:27:03] <ExpressNode> Bird is mad dogging your meat right now
[5:27:06] <TheDeimion> those are Berserk berds
[5:27:06] <Rbeatononefour> does that crow have teeth?
[5:27:06] <GamesNoir> Sound is all weird
[5:27:08] <Macguffn> Skettis?
[5:27:09] <%HiroProtagonest> Skexxies
[5:27:10] <%kknutson4> caelid is harder
[5:27:10] <XxMoliciousxX> holy shit they're huge
[5:27:12] <%greasypete00> caelid is stronger than liurnia
[5:27:13] <thesaverofhumens> what were those magic arrows he picked up earlier
[5:27:21] <%greasypete00> also those birds are giant
[5:27:27] <Warstar696> I thought the bomb throwing hawks were bad before
[5:27:32] <Warstar696> These are just awful
[5:27:39] <kugelblitz95> caelide
[5:27:39] <radiorosewater> piss
[5:27:54] <%LazyBumNetwork> My luck. Every time I join Pat is pissing
[5:28:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @warstar696 were they the fire breathing ones? i looked away but i hate the fire breathing ones
[5:28:24] <+BoboDaHobo> @LazyBumNetwork thats his secret cap
[5:28:27] <radiorosewater> or shitting
[5:28:56] <%whyskeywolfe> The first thing I did in this game was open the chest under the Dragon-burnt ruins. That got me. Then I opened the chest in the tower of Return. It got me again. Then coming home at night the Deathbird attacked. I think I need to stop playing for a bit.
[5:29:24] <Warstar696> @Brassnarwhal no. There's a section where hawks with SWORDS for legs fling explosive barrels around
[5:29:26] <%DeadlyPeaks> Think I’m going to go spellsword for 1st time since 2 handing is awkward to change in this 1
[5:29:40] <Warstar696> @Brassnarwhal these ones are nothing but necks and head
[5:29:50] <%Brassnarwhal> it gets worse
[5:30:05] <%LazyBumNetwork> Sounds like I missed some SHIT
[5:30:26] <Warstar696> The fact that enemies in this game go from 1 to 111 to 1,111 in seconds is terrifying
[5:30:41] <%LazyBumNetwork> The overall enemy design in this game is so cool.
[5:30:47] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Did Pat ever find the Second trapped chest?
[5:30:51] <razieltano123> Welcome Caelid, it sucks shit.
[5:31:08] <%DeadlyPeaks> What starting class did everyone pick?
[5:31:18] <%LazyBumNetwork> He found three @freakin_wolfy
[5:31:24] <%LazyBumNetwork> Last I saw
[5:31:28] <%MelfinaStarwind> lgwDance lgwDance lgwDance
[5:31:28] <%blankwaffle> can't wait to get this game lol
[5:31:46] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @LazyBumNetwork oh dang, I didn't know. Did he find the one that sends you to the Capital?
[5:31:48] <Warstar696> @DeadlyPeaks undecided. Also waiting for the PC version to be unfucked.
[5:31:57] <razieltano123> @DeadlyPeaks Paige pick the same one I did.
[5:32:07] <%LazyBumNetwork> Is that where the BIG MAN is?
[5:32:42] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @LazyBumNetwork yup
[5:32:46] <%DeadlyPeaks> I went hero, but changed to astrologer when I learned the 2 hand input
[5:32:57] <%abakkus> SingsNote ratJAM
[5:33:22] <%LazyBumNetwork> He went to the fucked mines, big man, and the bear. (Patches box)
[5:34:03] <radiorosewater> i agree with you
[5:34:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did Pat beat giant man?
[5:34:32] <Warstar696> Which giant man?
[5:34:43] <lockhead45> Guess tomorrow we might see the General fight, coolest boss in soulsborne right there
[5:34:46] <radiorosewater> big one
[5:34:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> There were more than one?!
[5:35:01] <Warstar696> Giant man, giant manchild, giant mandragon, giant manthing, ultragiant man?
[5:35:07] <Warstar696> ....
[5:35:18] <radiorosewater> and giant man with sword
[5:35:18] <razieltano123> Don't forget, Two Fingers.
[5:35:24] <lockhead45> giant bird
[5:35:37] <radiorosewater> what about giant giant
[5:35:39] <Warstar696> Oh, and giganto men with sword and bow.
[5:35:42] <xehanortheartless666666> gianrt?
[5:35:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I have been gone fore a while lol. I had to do video stuff. I saw a dead deer and giant like the one from DS3
[5:35:55] <Warstar696> There's also the giant pirate bowman
[5:36:02] <Warstar696> Sooo.... which giant?
[5:36:14] <@MistyMntns> Hi pat!
[5:36:22] <@MistyMntns> psaBig psaPeapoh
[5:36:25] <%FacetiousAF> it was a halberd giant
[5:36:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HYDRate
[5:36:29] <theanora1> a newly moist pat
[5:36:31] <radiorosewater> whos this guy?
[5:36:50] <@MistyMntns> Hydrate or Diedrate you fools
[5:36:50] <@Moobot> HEY DO YOU WANT A NEW COMPUTER GO TO https://artesianbuilds.com/?aff=Patstaresat . Use the promo code PATSTARESAT to save a couple hundred dollars off your purchase!

[5:36:59] <z_mad_j> Did he beat the boss?
[5:37:01] <@MistyMntns> A reminder to everyone to drink water! And no Soda is not water.
[5:37:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> So just like Sifu
[5:37:27] <%SABiscotti> @MistyMntns but coffee is hot dirty water
[5:37:33] <@MistyMntns> No it isnt
[5:37:34] <%scarman125> with the way Woolie Schedules playthroughs he is going to take an eternity to beat this game.
[5:37:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't think Woolie has even crossed the Stormgate yet
[5:37:40] <TheDeimion> it's weird because I saw ppl fight that ethereal viking area early on whereas you did it when you had all that cool stuff to do it with
[5:37:43] <radiorosewater> he spent half the session going for a boss he couldnt beat before completing the tutorial woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:37:54] <Warstar696> @z_mad_j which boss? Pat's taken down several so far
[5:38:01] <Warstar696> this stream
[5:38:06] <%FacetiousAF> too much
[5:38:09] <Ner234> LUL
[5:38:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> game's big
[5:38:13] <MaybeFalco> absolutely zero chance
[5:38:15] <@Fuggins4U> psaGotcha_SG sipsipGasm_SG
[5:38:15] <%FacetiousAF> 130 parts no dlc
[5:38:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @Pookiedaexzile more like 13 sentinels where pat beat it months before woolie
[5:38:18] <penitentpendant> I'm worried this might become another 'Sekiro' problem
[5:38:23] <%VictorVonLouche> This would be like at least a 100 parter for him on stream
[5:38:26] <z_mad_j> The last one he was at in the underground
[5:38:27] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Hey Pat, I'm sorry for how bitter I came across before, but I'm afraid I've succumbed to the "Plague" and become a lot more pessimistic and cautious overtime whenever I view Fromsofts games (especially the recent ones). I genuinely want to know what your take is on this question I'm about to ask: How much of Plague's, Spy's, and ENB's commentary on these games is proper constructive criticism, and how much of it is just pessimistic rambling disguised as constructive criticism?
[5:38:29] <digaogrunge> It is, it will take 2 years
[5:38:33] <Rbeatononefour> YEAAHH
[5:38:33] <%SABiscotti> hahahaha

[5:43:57] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @DestroPrime83 awesome ill check out the YT vid tonight
[5:43:57] <+itsanonbunny> i have so many questions
[5:44:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wanna Swamp it up over here or other there
[5:44:04] <BigYanno> so we know there are 3 poison swamps but how many regular swamps are there?
[5:44:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> shit is, in fact, large
[5:44:21] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @a_german_spy No I'm sorry, I have a lot of respect for you guys. I'm just so torn on this issue where I want to continue playing and enjoying these games, but since u guys are the most seasoned experts on this stuff, I feel like an asshole for even calling these "good" games. Don't feel at fault whatsoever, this is all me. I'm just an incredibly bitter and emotional mess that doesn't know what he wants.
[5:44:21] <%Warstar696> @BigYanno so far as I've seen, at least 6
[5:44:35] <$vehementvadr> what level is pat? it may soon come time for calid

[5:45:25] <Profmcstevie> Hit em with the CRAZY EYES
[5:45:33] <TheDeimion> I think you can get a summon of this type of skelly
[5:45:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the tutorial guy has new stuff after beating Godrick btw
[5:45:36] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> i like the pop they have when they die
[5:45:36] <%Warstar696> He got them thick bones

[5:45:53] <TheDeimion> warming stone? like the thing you put in your pocket to warm your hands?
[5:45:53] <ape_hawk> use the warming stone on vulpix
[5:45:55] <TheDeimion> that's nice
[5:46:10] <+silvery_cricket> Did you ever go to that island near the starting area?
[5:46:19] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> spin to win weapon
[5:46:25] <TheDeimion> LUL it's slightly cursed
[5:46:31] <%Monkeyweed21> what is that status
[5:46:33] <A_German_spy> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Relax, I was just teasing. The honest answer (from me, at least) is that the more you love something and the more passionate about it you are, the more familiar with it you become and the more you tend to scrutinize it as a result. People like Marcus and me, we tend to be more critical than others precisely because the series means so much to us.
[5:46:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> What's that smell
[5:46:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> its bluud
[5:46:47] <TheDeimion> @Monkeyweed21 curse

[5:47:06] <%bundle_of_herbs> time to powerstance scythes?
[5:47:23] <%Warstar696> It stated that it resisted evil spirits
[5:47:42] <A_German_spy> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy And for our part, we can always offer you a reason or a justification for our criticisms, even if it's just something like "personal preference." Beyond a certain point, it's just a subjective matter with no right or wrong answer.
[5:47:49] <%SWFanatic> toot

[5:48:46] <TheDeimion> mountn goatin' it today LUL
[5:48:53] <+anoldtoilet> just single jump dude
[5:48:53] <Blackleafx> Its Happening Again
[5:48:54] <penitentpendant> Yup
[5:48:56] <BigYanno> Gravity continues to be the number 1 cause of death in FromSoft games
[5:48:56] <HeroToxiko> huh
[5:48:59] <pi_in_the_sci> JUMP
[5:49:00] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[5:49:00] <TheDeimion> ohhh
[5:49:02] <%Dakuu75> I think Maining DEX has actually saved me from fall deaths a few times
[5:49:03] <%SWFanatic> gravity wins again
[5:49:04] <penitentpendant> People pointed it out during the network test
[5:49:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> thats dumb
[5:49:06] <MaybeFalco> yeah its weird
[5:49:08] <ape_hawk> souls games arent normal
[5:49:09] <A_German_spy> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy At the end of the day, you like the games you like, and there's absolutely no reason to feel down on yoursel for your own preferences. I make no apology for my feelings and preferences, and neither should you for yours.
[5:49:19] <spinningchurro> Try jumping off instead dog running off.
[5:49:21] <+mrjplays2k9> have to jump first to get double jump
[5:49:21] <Blackleafx> PogChamp
[5:49:23] <Blackleafx> he did it
[5:49:26] <Profmcstevie> It is not an air jump, it is a secondary jump
[5:49:27] <%gitgouda> probably because that would work in other games
[5:49:34] <Ner234> It would be hilarious if the horse would stop listening to you if you kill it too many times LUL
[5:49:36] <TheDeimion> I didn't know that but that makes sense so you can't easily cheese jumping off stuff
[5:49:39] <HeroToxiko> ooh
[5:49:42] <+Javaa01> I mean, you know just as well as the rest of us how this engine exist on nothing but code spaghetti, always assume shit to not work like you'd want to

[5:50:59] <BigYanno> Pull a The Sorrow but instead of having to fight everyone you've killed you fight weak versions of yourself from each time you died
[5:51:03] <%SWFanatic> silly giant, elden rings are for kids
[5:51:03] <+Javaa01> @Bloomingzonda No, because it's even jankier then that, fall damage isn't calculated by velocity, it's calculated by how long it's been since you've been on a surface you can walk on
[5:51:04] <TheDeimion> chuck smelly orbs at 'em
[5:51:15] <+anoldtoilet> no
[5:51:16] <HeroToxiko> staggered by magic?

[5:51:38] <%Warstar696> @HeroToxiko yep, seen it a few times so far

[5:53:58] <A_German_spy> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Don't worry about it. There's enough misery in the world as it is - no need for you to be needlessly subjecting yourself to any more. Sounds like you have a good goal, and as long as you hold onto that goal, you'll do just fine.
[5:53:58] <%Warstar696> Might be good for ultra-janky mounted combat

Cos whenever he speaks he sounds like an almost magical mixture between you and Plague. It's quite freaky actually! He also happens to have a degree in Philosophy I think.

[6:03:14] <@Ranryu692> do illusory walls work differently in this game? I was sure I'd found one (light was coming through the wall) but hitting it didn't work

[6:03:55] <MaybeFalco> @Ranryu692 you just hit them, you might have just seen a lighting bug
[6:03:58] <Manwad> blue means sorcery!
[6:04:00] <theanora1> weird cats are the best
[6:04:01] <%josnotforlewd> Did I just heat fucking Freddy Fazbear
[6:04:01] <binku_muja_> @Ranryu692 maybe magic might work?

[6:07:47] <%cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @a_german_spy Okay, then in that case if you're interested, he just so happens to have recently done playthroughs of almost all the souls games and them labeled as a series called "Boss Designs" where I provides some really interesting perspectives on not just the bosses but the themes of each game as a whole. It's the only series of videos that rivals the impact your guys videos made on me. Either way, keep on shining dude!

[6:10:19] <ExpressNode> I've been playing Elden Ring but it makes me feel guilty because I have other games I need to finish

[6:11:19] <%A_German_spy> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Not at all. Hope it helped lift your spirits at least a little.
[6:11:25] <@Ranryu692> @A_German_spy You were being wholesome and I wanted to show my appreciation lol
[6:11:40] <ExpressNode> Fun Fact: Pat in BRB is not orb
[6:11:47] <%A_German_spy> @Ranryu692 It means a lot, genuinely. Thank you.

[6:14:23] <%cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ranryu692 Spy is so kind and wholesome that I feel disgusted that he just gets labeled as "nice Plague". He really doesn't deserve to be called that.
[6:14:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Keep up the good work Pat

[6:19:22] <Nuke_Zack> I struggled with this dungeon more than any other
[6:19:29] <TheDeimion> is that glintstone?
[6:19:49] <%Monkeyweed21> You know how things keep getting more intricate and interesting the further from the tutorial you get? That doesn't stop
[6:19:50] <Rbeatononefour> nice
[6:19:52] <Blackleafx> CLOSE
[6:19:52] <TheDeimion> oh ya that's glintstone LUL
[6:19:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> this dungeon killed me a bunch of times too
[6:20:02] <xxHungryxx> I have a strong feeling that those lil' stone gremlins will be up there in "Most annoying enemies" was enough ppl have played it
[6:20:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I got summoned for a Margit fight, and the lag was so bad he was gliding around for half the fight. We won LUL
[6:20:04] <ape_hawk> EYYY
[6:20:12] <@Ranryu692> didn't even rate the message smh
[6:20:19] <ape_hawk> i think im gonna go for a dex build; sorc is too boring

[6:20:43] <TheDeimion> keep lookin' Pat
[6:20:50] <+BigBusinessKaiju> Are there fist weapons in Elden Ring or nah?
[6:20:52] <%linSP> I’m so tempted to bump arcane to 20 so I can roll in the drops
[6:21:08] <mrtanaka111> ass stryke
[6:21:09] <%stickygumbolee> Still aiming for a beefy faith lad?
[6:21:10] <jubejube56> Were there spots to jump off at the elevator in the beginning?
[6:21:21] <xxHungryxx> @bigbusinesskaiju the hook claws. become Wolverine
[6:21:31] <binku_muja_> the open sores on those enemies are distressing.
[6:21:49] <Wobuzhidao> So does crafting do anything or does Pat just not like it?
[6:21:57] <Blackleafx> OH HES WILDIN OUT
[6:22:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @BigBusinessKaiju at least 2 that I've seen
[6:22:16] <penitentpendant> Good combo
[6:22:20] <%SWFanatic> get the butt
[6:22:22] <sirjames079> Yooooo that combo was sick!
[6:22:25] <tolloponik> that dude was Pissed
[6:22:31] <Irishgamerlawd> Enemies mix it up a lot better in this
[6:22:32] <%LorcaNomad> wow there are like no openings in that guys attacks
[6:22:42] <%Warstar696> So many enemies have wild amounts of combos
[6:22:51] <Elsewize> went ham on him
[6:22:55] <Manwad> the ogres are not without martial prowess
[6:22:56] <penitentpendant> When the enemies have been lab-ing their 'touch of death comboes'
[6:23:11] <Irishgamerlawd> Didnt like playing grabass
[6:23:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> While you were exploring the Scrunko Fields, they were in the lab working on their combos
[6:23:36] <EynoStiles> he moves fast for a big dude
[6:24:01] <ape_hawk> so now that elden ring lets you crouch, you can teabag enemies and bosses
[6:24:15] <%LorcaNomad> eyyyyy
[6:24:30] <sirjames079> Been killed by mimics in the other games enough that I fear grab attacks like that
[6:24:31] <Irishgamerlawd> seems like he has a little punch to combo break you too
[6:24:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wonderful
[6:24:53] <Manwad> i wonder if his grab's a bear hug or a powerbomb
[6:25:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Get em Pat
[6:25:15] <ape_hawk> you sure showed him, pat
[6:25:18] <Irishgamerlawd> Judging by his mahoosive frame id say bite
[6:25:19] <epicrunner3> swear every time I get to the stream, pats already in a "oh shit situation " lol
[6:25:19] <+kewlmyc> Lol, I just got done doing this cave, just to come here and see Pat doing it
[6:25:27] <MaritimeSpanker> I think he gave you a new physick thing that you picked up back there
[6:25:29] <%SWFanatic> lol
[6:25:37] <penitentpendant> Glad traps are so useful in this game
[6:25:38] <Rbeatononefour> kekeke
[6:25:52] <sirjames079> Keep seeing walls and thinking that THIS one is gonna be illusory
[6:26:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> quick question chat, have you been crafting? because I sure haven't
[6:26:20] <%Monkeyweed21> DOP GPRIEST

[6:54:15] <%hereiam407> Isn't there supposed to be stealth mechanics?
[6:54:15] <%gitgouda> those death cries in this game are great
[6:54:15] <%Brassnarwhal> fire spells being a part of faith that is considered heretical feels very similar to how pyromancy was a sorcery but the sorcerors thought it was bad before it split off into pyromancy in the souls games

[6:56:16] <radiorosewater> putting ads on a stream is a great way to remind me to never go to your shit fast food place

[6:57:24] <%tusk102> @wizard_of_diamonds its one of her knights
[6:57:32] <%hereiam407> You can't stand my spear wave
[6:57:32] <binku_muja_> she better not summon a hail of arrows like that prick in DS3.
[6:57:33] <+kewlmyc> Pat thought it was Ms. Elden Ring
[6:57:37] <andoowhy> NICE
[6:57:38] <%barrakuta371> That was some Nier shit

[6:58:24] <binku_muja_> do we still not know what the scarlet rot is yet?
[6:58:27] <steelknigh> well that was easy
[6:58:35] <AllenDeadman> it's interesting that the pretty Valkyrie people are the ones related to rot
[6:58:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @binku_muja_ as a status effect or as lore?
[6:58:50] <%Warstar696> @binku_muja_ no, but we don't know what this "cleanrot" is either
[6:58:51] <AllenDeadman> I have an inkling of what caused it
[6:59:02] <joodatious> wow pat can almost see the first half of the map
[6:59:03] <dan_g_v> small cave huh
[6:59:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> kinda sounds like dragon rot
[6:59:20] <radiorosewater> so... what exactly is the story of this game? I don't think i follow
[6:59:22] <Saltmeisterr> @Warstar696 cleanrot and scarlet rot are the same thing
[6:59:25] <joodatious> cant wait until the rest of the 75% of the map is revealed
[6:59:29] <tanarath> It seems like disease made into a horrifying, land-terraforming problem
[6:59:37] <+Havictos> has pat been to the beast church yet?
[6:59:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @warstar696 i assumed a cleanrot knight was a knight who fought against the rot not that cleanrot is a different rot, but that's just speculation on my part
[6:59:43] <%greasypete00> is this the academy
[6:59:46] <binku_muja_> the way its been referenced it seems more like a sickness instead of a poison.
[6:59:49] <%Warstar696> Touch grass!
[6:59:59] <%Warstar696> @Saltmeisterr that better not be a spoiler.
[7:00:04] <+anoldtoilet> it looks like a fungus
[7:00:06] <XxMoliciousxX> this isn't ominous at all
[7:00:07] <%Bloomingzonda> The academy is where Steve Getenburg is
[7:00:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @binku_muja_ could be bloodborne
[7:00:11] <+anoldtoilet> which makes sense w these shroom guys in that cavew
[7:00:13] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[7:00:20] <dan_g_v> guys don't ask about specifics
[7:00:22] <TheDeimion> huh.. glintstone magics
[7:00:24] <%gitgouda> this part was fun
[7:00:31] <dan_g_v> you may spoil things
[7:00:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> @radiorosewater Far as I can glean, you're trying to become an Elden Lord.
[7:00:37] <Saltmeisterr> @anoldtoilet im just intuiting based of the items pat picked up
[7:00:39] <binku_muja_> @Brassnarwhal thats a good point actually. it would be interesting if that were the case.
[7:00:39] <sirjames079> Continuously amazed at how huge this map is, I knew it was gonna be a big game but I guess I wasn't expecting something quite this huge from FromSoft
[7:00:45] <Rbeatononefour> that island...
[7:00:45] <TheDeimion> somekind of... island
[7:00:47] <Saltmeisterr> wait wrong person
[7:00:49] <Saltmeisterr> lol
[7:00:58] <digaogrunge> On an island?
[7:00:59] <%gitgouda> yes
[7:01:03] <TheDeimion> wait isn't that down by the shore?
[7:01:06] <Saltmeisterr> @Warstar696 im just intuiting based of the items pat picked up.
[7:01:09] <TheDeimion> near the beginning
[7:01:10] <%LazyBumNetwork> Blue key card needed
[7:01:15] <XxMoliciousxX> poor ENB, he's playing a mage and can't find the trainer
[7:01:34] <penitentpendant> Scrape what you have the map for first, makes sense
[7:01:41] <joodatious> ENB still exists? damn
[7:01:41] <%FacetiousAF> so the game is good?
[7:01:57] <joodatious> yes game very good
[7:02:03] <%Nobrev> very good
[7:02:16] <+anoldtoilet> @XxMoliciousxX the good one is pretty hidden
[7:02:17] <julrave> Elden Ring is one of the video games of all time
[7:02:27] <radiorosewater> very good, not so good on pc yet
[7:02:32] <binku_muja_> that fall animation... NotLikeThis
[7:02:34] <arkv01> ENBs been hibernating since 2016 and now he wakes up to feed
[7:02:35] <%Warstar696> It's blood!
[7:02:40] <Rbeatononefour> man, i bet we could craft a TON of stuff now
[7:02:44] <FourLeafLover> I've heard good things about beast blood
[7:02:53] <TioXyco> @Warstar696 Hope this is not Chris's blood
[7:03:01] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah
[7:03:15] <+anoldtoilet> @arkv01 hes beem streaming a bunch of cool old games. did a run of the valkyrie profile series recently. vagrant story, etc
[7:03:16] <xxHungryxx> keyword is "tried" 😏
[7:03:17] <+abrupt_abe> LUL
[7:03:22] <radiorosewater> put a message down pat
[7:03:25] <%Dakuu75> dude, I've been watching bits and piece of Pat, Paige and Max play this. WHILE playing it myself... my brain is fryed
[7:03:26] <radiorosewater> ahhh
[7:03:37] <+NobuuNobuu> did pat finish the first area yet?
[7:03:52] <Elsewize> *Notices 11k runes* ...Yep, nothing to fret over.
[7:03:58] <Rbeatononefour> theres an Updraft there Pat!
[7:04:03] <binku_muja_> not again...
[7:04:08] <XxMoliciousxX> I'm still in the DS mindset "man the undead burg sure goes on forever"
[7:04:22] <%Warstar696> Casters and archers are bullshit
[7:04:24] <pi_in_the_sci> There was an updraft to jump down over where you looked at thing
[7:04:25] <%hereiam407> That's a nimble horsey
[7:04:32] <Blackleafx> yo look at his head
[7:04:35] <%hereiam407> Sick helmet bro

[7:05:08] <xxHungryxx> Sorcery is OP ❤️
[7:05:30] <tolloponik> their strings have been cut now they can do their full move set
[7:05:31] <TheDeimion> maybe it's like a necromancer sorta thing? and that guy you killed up there reses them?
[7:05:40] <binku_muja_> trapped souls perhaps?
[7:05:44] <%Warstar696> The phantom pain
[7:05:47] <TheDeimion> lol noble weak
[7:05:59] <+anoldtoilet> oh it could be someone else using ashes

[7:10:14] <stealthfart> That was a cool piece of art
[7:10:31] <%JoshManVGH> Are the telescopes on the map related to the paintings, or are those something else?

[7:11:58] <TheDeimion> THAT"S CURSE
[7:11:58] <sirjames079> Maybe the Elden Ring is the friends we made along the way
[7:11:59] <Frranky> this fucking crab just walks through a tree smashing it to splinters
[7:12:00] <+Pachi3000> our friendships were the Elden Ring
[7:12:01] <julrave> a bit scrungly

[7:13:00] <@Ranryu692> "What is up with this tree?" should be on the back of the box
[7:13:00] <TheDeimion> grafted by curse to the tree
[7:13:01] <%Monkeyweed21> they died doing what they loved
[7:13:01] <+Namillus> That checks out, the catacomb boss rooms have massive root formations with bodies climbing into them
[7:13:03] <tanarath> Swamp
[7:13:03] <+Havictos> I'm still not sure what the elden ring even is. It a physical object or what?
[7:13:04] <+xcompleasedad> What can you even craft with half of this shit?
[7:13:16] <+Havictos> like the triforce?
[7:13:19] <%Dakuu75> Miyazaki, pandering to the Bloodborne fans

[7:20:31] <TioXyco> the damage compensates the wind-up
[7:20:35] <Gorgs7> I whip my snake back and forth
[7:20:38] <theanora1> a wolf ht and now a tail
[7:20:42] <TheDeimion> needs more experimentation
[7:20:43] <+Beetlewins> How many patches until miracles are useless you think? I reckon the nerf starts next patch
[7:20:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> If it does... that's the best spell ever.
[7:20:45] <heartlesshealer> @Havictos I'm never gonna play, so yes. Even moreso now 👀
[7:20:51] <xxHungryxx> But you'd hit everyone in front of you tho so worth the slow start up
[7:20:55] <%hereiam407> Punt him
[7:20:57] <penitentpendant> The popup
[7:20:59] <TheDeimion> WOOW you can launch
[7:21:06] <TheDeimion> ...
[7:21:12] <%hereiam407> Gotta get the full extension to air up
[7:21:13] <derekpwns> died to wolf
[7:21:15] <TheDeimion> but what about that regen
[7:21:16] <+Havictos> not on that wolf it seems
[7:21:21] <heartlesshealer> oooh, like a beetle horn, neat
[7:21:22] <TheDeimion> 👀
[7:21:26] <+BigBusinessKaiju> Bro really said "CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY!"
[7:21:37] <%FacetiousAF> huh
[7:21:40] <%FacetiousAF> you need me?
[7:21:44] <xxHungryxx> The shoulder charge seems fun
[7:21:51] <NewWillinium> I._.i think Fromsoft has PEAKED. They're not going to be able to top this
[7:21:59] <TheDeimion> that's decent regen
[7:22:06] <penitentpendant> Decent regen, but how long lasting?
[7:22:09] <%hereiam407> A pip a second
[7:22:09] <Gray_LoFi> Does that stack with Flask regen?
[7:22:14] <+Havictos> could be better
[7:22:18] <TheDeimion> if you play careful you can basically go without having to heal
[7:22:22] <TioXyco> does it stack with other sources of regens?
[7:22:23] <+Namillus> By the way it seems like the shield Wondrous Physick blocks One Hit
[7:22:28] <%Dakuu75> @Gray_LoFi I'm surer it does
[7:22:35] <TheDeimion> probably does
[7:22:44] <roguemephilesclone> The Anti-Toxic
[7:22:48] <TheDeimion> it's a different regen so it should?
[7:22:54] <%VashyronM> it's already past it cost value
[7:22:59] <TheDeimion> yaaa @roguemephilesclone that's a good point
[7:23:00] <BlueBiscuitGT> quite a while
[7:23:08] <penitentpendant> It keeps goin'
[7:23:10] <TheDeimion> it would practically null poison
[7:23:13] <G_476> shield physick seems good against one-hit bosses like the that dragonman
[7:23:18] <Rbeatononefour> there's a full bar at least
[7:23:22] <TheDeimion> LUL it's still on
[7:23:25] <xxHungryxx> more then a minute
[7:23:26] <+Namillus> Holy shit it's still going
[7:23:28] <+Havictos> what's the numbers on that regen is it enough to cancel out poison?
[7:23:34] <narusao> this is such a zelda feel
[7:23:35] <pi_in_the_sci> this regen lasts for a while
[7:23:36] <TheDeimion> man they wanted ppl to have FUN with the magic in this game
[7:23:46] <roguemephilesclone> I was more right than I knew! It's STILL going!
[7:23:52] <penitentpendant> Finally stopped
[7:23:54] <roguemephilesclone> Just stopped.
[7:24:01] <TheDeimion> it stopped how long was that
[7:24:04] <+Namillus> Do you have the Beast Talisman equipped Pat?
[7:24:05] <xxHungryxx> about two minutes almost
[7:24:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> A minute and a half or so.
[7:24:09] <roguemephilesclone> That was at least a minute.
[7:24:10] <%Warstar696> Touch grass
[7:24:13] <TheDeimion> damn
[7:24:13] <%Dakuu75> about 2
[7:24:16] <pi_in_the_sci> I think at least 2 minutes, maybe 3
[7:24:17] <TheDeimion> actually worth
[7:24:22] <TheDeimion> grass: touched Kreygasm
[7:24:23] <tanarath> Physics seem pretty based.
[7:24:25] <roguemephilesclone> And probably 100% of your current health.
[7:24:25] <XxMoliciousxX> now to find power within
[7:24:30] <Elsewize> That's a good one
[7:24:35] <+Schroedingers> PokPikachu
[7:24:37] <+Namillus> Its duration might be extended by the Beast Seal
[7:24:42] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There is so much shit on this part of the map
[7:24:42] <xxHungryxx> Beast spells are strong AF
[7:24:49] <%Dakuu75> always hated how short the regens lasted in other souls games
[7:24:55] <+Local16> did he kill the guy around that house?
[7:25:03] <%FacetiousAF> OH
[7:25:10] <%pinkslimegoblin> fuck yeah I just beat a big boss
[7:25:11] <Rbeatononefour> toasty

[7:25:36] <Minorou> Lucy!
[7:25:40] <Elsewize> PHANTOM GIANT!
[7:25:42] <%stickygumbolee> Good luck with your Elden Ringing
[7:25:42] <%LorcaNomad> oh that giant has a helmet on
[7:25:48] <Frranky> just put a helmet on a giant and put it in the army why not
[7:25:51] <roguemephilesclone> I presume the soldiers are fighting their own defenses because the people inside the Academy are crazy.
[7:25:52] <%greasypete00> i wonder if you can get these ashes
[7:25:53] <xxHungryxx> Oh, the pole hammer?
[7:25:53] <+Namillus> So uh I'm guessing Raya Lucari have been fucking around with spirits and the spirits have gained/regained sapience and are mad about it
[7:25:55] <%Warstar696> Does this answer the question of "WHICH GIANT" yet?
[7:25:57] <+anoldtoilet> hes a knight!
[7:25:59] <Frranky> if you can put a helmet on you're in
[7:25:59] <+anoldtoilet> omg

[7:28:01] <xxHungryxx> Because War
[7:28:06] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> war
[7:28:07] <%Warstar696> Rotbois vs ghoastbois. It's an eternal conflict

[7:29:08] <%SABiscotti> BEAR
[7:29:09] <mrapplebucks> bear
[7:29:14] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly i find it really dumb how mages get oppressed in fantAsy stories.  They can shoot magic ffs
[7:29:16] <%SABiscotti> gone =[
[7:29:25] <%Monkeyweed21> just a regular bear
[7:29:25] <%Warstar696> If only defeating a bear was that easy in real life
[7:29:38] <Rbeatononefour> must be one nearby like usual!
[7:29:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> She just loves grapes
[7:29:45] <%Dakuu75> grape lust
[7:29:45] <tanarath> Mark her on the map
[7:29:45] <xxHungryxx> I have a feeling Beast Claw will be one of the last spells that big dude will give you. It was strong in the network test
[7:29:50] <+Pendragwn> got any grapes
[7:29:51] <%Warstar696> @T_Sasquatch agreed.
[7:29:52] <penitentpendant> At least grapes seem reliably in her vicinity every time

[7:29:58] <AdmiralButtloaf> bring here the low poly grapes
[7:29:59] <+Pendragwn> mark that grape hoe on the map
[7:30:02] <heartlesshealer> wait, she's the grape maiden?

[7:30:05] <+Pendragwn> come back when you are a duck
[7:30:12] <heartlesshealer> yeah mark her
[7:30:16] <penitentpendant> Weather in Silent Hill: IT ALWAYS FOGGY!
[7:30:18] <jubejube56> Seems like the grapes are always super close to her
[7:30:19] <%Agami23> just tuning in, has he found any grapes?
[7:30:21] <+Havictos> @t_sasquatch for how
[7:30:23] <mrapplebucks> Chest it is
[7:30:26] <%Warstar696> @heartlesshealer yeah. Every single time she talks about what happens after she eats one is a gigantic squick loredump
[7:30:36] <%Warstar696> @Agami23 several.
[7:30:41] <%Warstar696> And they keep. getting. worse.

[7:31:55] <penitentpendant> Someone's been roiding the bears again
[7:32:00] <Rbeatononefour> Bleed him i guess
[7:32:04] <Ner234> That bear is RIPPED
[7:32:04] <Frranky> you're bearly doing any damage
[7:32:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> But can he bleed
[7:32:12] <%Warstar696> If the visceral attack is reaching up his ass I am out
[7:32:18] <%cade_calrayn> Only the buffest of bears are permitted in Liurnia
[7:32:18] <xxHungryxx> It's actually a Druid
[7:32:21] <%Brassnarwhal> you can only summon when theres a grave stone symbol on the left of the screen
[7:32:22] <penitentpendant> @Sigma_190_Beta No grave symbol, so Oleg can't be summoned it looks like
[7:32:22] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i hate bears
[7:32:28] <kirbykyodai> this might as well be a boss lol
[7:32:30] <Frranky> if the visceral attack is reaching up his as I am in

[7:40:00] <+AngryHomunculus> Honestly this bear talk is reminding me of how the Panserbjorn in His Dark Materials have opposable thumbs
[7:40:02] <%hereiam407> Looks like QA is doing their jobs
[7:40:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @ner234 if you dont believe me open the chest under dragonburnt ruins

[7:42:06] <+AngryHomunculus> @Quack_of_Dawn you mean spiders?
[7:42:11] <+HaloIsA> @Brassnarwhal nah it was the merchant at the beginning part of Stormveil at the bottom of all the stairs
[7:42:17] <%Brassnarwhal> cause they kill you and put their eggs in you
[7:42:22] <%Warstar696> Those aren't spiders.
[7:42:22] <%YakumoYomi> "Slug Nightmare" is a good boss name
[7:42:41] <%cade_calrayn> nah, this whole world seems built for double jumps
[7:42:44] <penitentpendant> Probably to differentiate it more from the player jump
[7:42:45] <%HiroProtagonest> Isn't a slug nightmare just a ton of salt
[7:42:53] <%whyskeywolfe> @yakumoyomi That’s my FOXHOUND name
