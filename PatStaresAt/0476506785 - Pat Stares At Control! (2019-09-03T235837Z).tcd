[0:04:34] <%pabstblueriven> pabstblueriven subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Maybe it's just because of how anime Astral Chain is but watching Control reminds me of an anime called [C] Control which has credit card and stock-powered Stands.

[0:23:57] <professormorrigan> how far into Control is Pattorick?
[0:24:00] <%devanmuse> I've been in and out of his Control streams; has he fought any enemy besides the Humans possessed by the Hiss yet? It'd be crummy if those were your only enemies in this setting
[0:24:02] <%whiskey_wolfe_> what about the one where if you don't go to church your mom turns your arm into a snake
[0:24:04] <Antrodox> but why that seems rude

[0:24:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway500 bonus50 There's a certain aesthetic I've just noticed and I'm a huge fan of it. Void dimensions with floaty stuff, usually geometrical, and particle effects everywhere. The Astral Plane in both games you're playing, and the Twilight Realm from Zelda. Any other examples of that you can think of?

[0:29:04] <@lewdskeletor13> @anceldelambert There’s some exploits that Pat is trying to fix stuttering in the game
[0:29:04] <%AncelDeLambert> is this Epic store bs, or is the game bugging out?
[0:29:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway500 bonus50 Best part of 096 is that they took a D-class who was a tattoo artist, and put him in a metal box at the bottom of a lake, to buy as much time as possible for him to take out a photo of 096, draw it, and put that shit in a waterproof box before he gets eaten. So now they can safely know what it looks like.

[0:36:46] <ape_hawk> launch is the go-to for everything in this game
[0:36:53] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, he found the first puppet video
[0:36:55] <%hawk_rush> @lewdskeletor13 i believe os, yeah
[0:36:58] <SulfurousAcid> controlled bursts
[0:37:03] <%floralkami> @Sphincter_Spelunker she wasn't, i checked
[0:37:07] <+nekodelic> @flyingavocadosofdoom I saw another streamer sequence-break that segment, it was pretty fun to watch
[0:37:08] <Soul_Intern> Awww
[0:37:08] <TheMorilo> yeyeyeye research is the best
[0:37:09] <+SCMike00> this is one good looking game!
[0:37:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> dang it
[0:37:11] <Soul_Intern> Thats a bummer
[0:37:12] <@commanderclaw> Go to the Ritual Division, there's a sidequest there
[0:37:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> is the volume a bit low for everyone else or just me
[0:37:24] <Soul_Intern> UUH
[0:37:24] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pistol and Shotgun best guns
[0:37:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sniper is okay
[0:37:34] <@commanderclaw> In research
[0:37:35] <%dukenux> Look at that Twin Peaks/Shining rug
[0:37:41] <%dukenux> really ties the hallway together
[0:37:47] <iswearimjustdandy> @doc_ock_rokc volume is fine for me
[0:37:47] <Soul_Intern> YEAH
[0:37:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Apparently the actress who plays Jesse, Courtney Hope, was in Quantum Break too
[0:37:48] <bleugh> is she the x-files
[0:37:49] <%brickwall35> brickwall35 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Pat! Thanks for the fantastic content as always. If you could, give a shout-out to my amazing girlfriend (Ms brickwall35) for working so hard, I'm very proud of her!
[0:37:49] <%Aeoneth> @commanderclaw he just got to research he won't know where that is
[0:37:50] <%starotter70> I keep forgetting the BOLD text
[0:37:51] <Soul_Intern> FUCKING DOPE TITTLE CARD
[0:37:53] <Mendin> Never get tired of those titlecards
[0:37:53] <fusedforms> love those titles
[0:37:56] <Jontman42> Those title cards feel good
[0:37:57] <%blastazoid26> This game is so surreal
[0:38:01] <%mistymntns> Just wait untill you get into the Hypnotic Lab.
[0:38:02] <@lewdskeletor13> That title card is still good shit
[0:38:06] <%dukenux> DARLING-KUUUN
[0:38:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> nice glasses, nerd
[0:38:07] <RyuuAoi> Don't talk about side quests! He will never beat the game!
[0:38:09] <%Calek> it's Alan Wake man!
[0:38:12] <%blastazoid26> A NERD
[0:38:13] <+The_Butterfly_Man> is this game at all difficult because every time I watch someone play they are just steam rolling threw everything with most of the time just one hit punching or throwing stuff at guys that also die in one hit.
[0:38:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeah game volume is a bit low for me
[0:38:16] <TalekAetem> Alan Wake!
[0:38:17] <%Ynkubus18> Darling~
[0:38:18] <%Ion_Laser> I need this game on Steam NotLikeThis
[0:38:22] <kartanonperuna> Voice actor of Alan Wake
[0:38:24] <%dukenux> Wait, is he played by Alan Wake?
[0:38:25] <%Calek> @The_Butterfly_Man it's rather easy
[0:38:26] <%dukenux> that's cool
[0:38:27] <RyuuAoi> They lied
[0:38:31] <mayorrev> This is Alan Wake's VA?
[0:38:32] <Marpolo13> looks............sciency
[0:38:34] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat you can go into darlings office at the top of the stairs
[0:38:36] <%dukenux> Look at these dorks
[0:38:40] <%floralkami> @dukenux YEP
[0:38:40] <RyuuAoi> He has sex in there?!
[0:38:40] <%starotter70> wow
[0:38:40] <%collind99> Yeah @mayorrev
[0:38:40] <Soul_Intern> SO AWKAWRD
[0:38:42] <Smart_ZaK1> Can you turn up the game volume?
[0:38:44] <mayorrev> oooh
[0:38:45] <Jontman42> Look at them doing sciencey bullshit
[0:38:46] <kartanonperuna> Not the model for Alan Wake but hes the voice actor
[0:38:47] <insomniacjezz> man video games are pretty anymore
[0:38:48] <%Laecerelius> We saw this video before but without audio
[0:38:51] <iswearimjustdandy> Just ate a bowl of brownie dust feelin good
[0:38:58] <%floralkami> Turn up volume?
[0:39:00] <derekwst3> this looks so real...
[0:39:01] <%dukenux> :)
[0:39:01] <%Aeoneth> Sure thin Mr Wake
[0:39:01] <%crimsonharvest> i hope i look that good when my hair is that color
[0:39:02] <RantingRavager> :)
[0:39:02] <WoodenTarkus> What a nerd
[0:39:03] <Soul_Intern> :)
[0:39:05] <nevan0> :)
[0:39:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> if that's not the VA himself, that's some solid ADR
[0:39:09] <+nekodelic> he's such a darling
[0:39:10] <mayorrev> rude!
[0:39:10] <Marpolo13> what a loser
[0:39:11] <%blastazoid26> This feels like portal
[0:39:14] <zipfile777> SPEEN
[0:39:16] <%starotter70> WOW
[0:39:17] <%Calek> it is the VA himself
[0:39:17] <transporterthesequel> Ah some pre-emptive KILL
[0:39:17] <Soul_Intern> INMEDIATLY SHOOTS HIM
[0:39:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat Darling is played by Alan Wake, all the warriors are here
[0:39:21] <Soul_Intern> SPEEN
[0:39:22] <$Chatterbox1991> Was that the Radio Man from Vampire the Masqourade?
[0:39:24] <+PodreySanchezz> Whats up with the fps/screen turing?
[0:39:25] <%dukenux> RIP Tree :(
[0:39:30] <TheMorilo> Darling is played by the same actor as alan wake
[0:39:36] <KaliasTV> Indestructible TV SCP
[0:39:38] <%blastazoid26> Paaaat dont be rude to trees
[0:39:40] <ape_hawk> looks like the ritual department is... blocked off
[0:39:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Daddy Wake
[0:39:45] <%QueequegTheater> Does this game have an equivalent to SCP D-bois?
[0:39:48] <+PodreySanchezz> Alan Wake 2 when!!
[0:39:48] <@commanderclaw> Oh no, it's been 11 years since Alan Wake
[0:39:49] <SubjectX07x> MEMETIC KILL AGENT ADMINISTERED
[0:39:49] <kartanonperuna> Not the model but the voice actor
[0:39:49] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @derekwst3 well that video was live action
[0:39:50] <samperson12345> SPEEN
[0:39:52] <%Boscuito> aw bummer
[0:39:53] <%Calek> the voice actor of Alan Wake specifically, not the character model
[0:39:53] <%nmaten> coward
[0:39:54] <%hawk_rush> default pistol is blessed
[0:39:55] <%velemi> BUT SPEEN
[0:39:55] <mayorrev> NO SPEEN?
[0:39:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> Spin is bad
[0:39:56] <Soul_Intern> SPEEN
[0:39:57] <Daxalog> Has the stream always had the Layout in the bottom and and left? Or have i jst never noticed?
[0:40:00] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, it seems like you use default and then either SPEEN or shotty
[0:40:00] <%Boscuito> i love me spin
[0:40:01] <%arancet> i didnt at first, but spin really grew on me
[0:40:01] <%Aeoneth> Default Pistol is god tier
[0:40:02] <@lewdskeletor13> SPEEN
[0:40:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> Spin is real bad
[0:40:04] <%Calek> Ilka Villi is the character model of Alan Wake
[0:40:05] <%dukenux> It might be the Dead Space casus
[0:40:05] <%floralkami> Ooooooooh, you don't even know
[0:40:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> ah, that makes more sense @Calek
[0:40:11] <%Mega_Pengers> spin is kind of shit
[0:40:11] <%Aeoneth> I didn't like any of the other configurations
[0:40:12] <%QueequegTheater> So it's like Halo
[0:40:14] <%dukenux> where the base gun is the absolutely best one
[0:40:17] <Trash_leviathan> why are there people floating like that
[0:40:18] <WoodenTarkus> Spin is powerful AF if you have it modded right
[0:40:18] <Soul_Intern> OH FCUK
[0:40:19] <Mendin> eat the moss
[0:40:20] <RyuuAoi> Ebony & ivory
[0:40:21] <Soul_Intern> OH GOD
[0:40:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Not enough damage out put to how much weapon juice it uses
[0:40:22] <kartanonperuna> Theres so many references to all past Remedy games in CONTROL, even Max Payne and Quantum Break even though they dont own those ip's
[0:40:24] <SulfurousAcid> maybe if you used controlled bursts
[0:40:25] <%collind99> @angriestpat not the face model just the voice actor
[0:40:28] <@commanderclaw> It's Fine
[0:40:30] <Soul_Intern> OH FUCK OH GODJ
[0:40:34] <Soul_Intern> NATURE OF SONG
[0:40:35] <Marpolo13> @dukenux seems like it
[0:40:35] <%pectusumbra> that's literally an SCP
[0:40:38] <%Aeoneth> It is
[0:40:43] <%Laecerelius> It's very well balanced at least
[0:40:46] <%Aeoneth> Grip is really strong throughout the game
[0:40:49] <transporterthesequel> OH
[0:40:50] <%some_sunflowers> @AngriestPat Is this the weapon version of "mouth feel"?
[0:40:50] <Jontman42> Sing to them Pat
[0:40:51] <%QueequegTheater> Was the M6 pistol a keter
[0:40:54] <Soul_Intern> Use GUN
[0:40:55] <transporterthesequel> That's a LOT of plant
[0:40:55] <cherrycottontail> sing to it pat
[0:40:57] <grayjammer> Spin was godlike in my playthrough personally. suppose it depends
[0:40:57] <Soul_Intern> Leave SPEEN
[0:41:00] <$shurtal> the "FEEL" of 60fps
[0:41:03] <RyuuAoi> BIG GUN DICK ENERGY
[0:41:06] <flyingavocadosofdoom> It's by far the best gun
[0:41:06] <%Ion_Laser> Sup bro
[0:41:09] <%Ranryu692> Great album
[0:41:11] <kartanonperuna> Spin is actually really fucking good if you know how to use it
[0:41:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Halo pistol had some nice heft to it. Never bothered with Halo series, but that gun felt good
[0:41:19] <%QueequegTheater> It really makes you feel like SCPider-Man
[0:41:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Grip is probably the best gun tbh
[0:41:33] <+NerevaRising> STRANDS
[0:41:38] <%dukenux> Fuckiing magnets. How do they work?
[0:41:39] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s all connected man
[0:41:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Per-so-na
[0:41:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeyeye Jung
[0:41:53] <+NerevaRising> yunk
[0:41:53] <Mister_McDerp> Jung is way cooler
[0:41:55] <TalekAetem> Grip with the [redacted] mod is amazing
[0:41:56] <%QueequegTheater> Jung was also much less of a wackjob
[0:41:58] <%Calek> Freud is bad
[0:41:58] <RantingRavager> It's pronounced Jung
[0:41:58] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Hurray Behaviorlism!
[0:41:59] <sulkysulko> young carl
[0:41:59] <%devanmuse> Also: Freud was a hack
[0:41:59] <%whiskey_wolfe_> a lot more hokum you mean
[0:42:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Like Shadows and Personas?
[0:42:09] <ape_hawk> also yung didnt have a "you wanna fuck your mother" approach to everything
[0:42:11] <%Double_Tap_That> I thought Jung was Freud's student?
[0:42:12] <%starotter70> Was Jung less horny?
[0:42:13] <%dukenux> @AngriestPat Does Jung still hold up though, atleast partially, unlike Frau- i mean Freud.
[0:42:14] <Jontman42> Screw Freud
[0:42:17] <Soul_Intern> HAH
[0:42:22] <%Ion_Laser> @Sphincter_Spelunker It got nerfed in Halo 2. But it got better from 3 onwards
[0:42:22] <Charuzu> wackjob is relative when comparing those two
[0:42:23] <+nekodelic> I forget that Pat studied psychology
[0:42:26] <Soul_Intern> 343 WONT REMEMBER YOU ENRDS
[0:42:29] <%TDotGoat> if it's pronounced Yung, how come it's spelled wrong?
[0:42:30] <transporterthesequel> Yeah that's way too many plants
[0:42:35] <%ElenaManetta> webinar is a term i havent heard in awhile
[0:42:36] <Trash_leviathan> i thought jung was freuds successor
[0:42:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Freud. "You get sexual satisfaction from pooping." K bud
[0:42:38] <Soul_Intern> YEAH
[0:42:40] <Soul_Intern> GUN
[0:42:48] <Djinnazz> Fraude was kind of a hack
[0:42:48] <@commanderclaw> Grip is good for headshots
[0:42:52] <%QueequegTheater> Freud was a crack-smoking mommy-obsessed weirdo who had some solid research in infant development but then everything else was trite nonsense
[0:42:52] <%Luesagna00> @AngriestPat is paige the dead?
[0:43:02] <%king_wragles> it'd be sick if there was a revolver mode called "Lucky"
[0:43:08] <Soul_Intern> Oh boy
[0:43:09] <MasterDecoder> @Sphincter_Spelunker I mean, half right, sometimes
[0:43:11] <%Aeoneth> Hey Pat, I just remembered, when you pass through Luck and Probability Research take a second and look around. There's a sidequest there that is completely unmarked and not told to you that unlocks an outfit. But it requires you to have a lv5 keycard
[0:43:12] <bleugh> are we shooting ghosts
[0:43:14] <%InugamiTheHound> yeah semi auto pistol feels better than machine pistol in this game
[0:43:19] <%QueequegTheater> Get this man some 999 goo
[0:43:21] <WoodenTarkus> i-frames KreyGasm
[0:43:23] <%devanmuse> So how long until there's an enemy in this game that isn't just Hiss Possessed Humans?
[0:43:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fucking lol
[0:43:37] <transporterthesequel> Wait GIANT TREE
[0:43:37] <%wsintai> You arent right but you arent wrong
[0:43:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He just suicide bombed you, but without a bomb.
[0:43:41] <chaos2frozen> Grip feels really good and a great all rounder weapon. I eventually got Spin to work by slapping on a huge damage boost and accuracy mods
[0:43:43] <transporterthesequel> why GIANT TREE
[0:43:43] <Soul_Intern> GIANT TREE
[0:43:44] <cureneckbeard> Leave this place zombie goasts!
[0:43:55] <%Calek> @devanmuse there's one you have to kill that isn't human at all but it doesn't attack, and the other is I don't know what it is
[0:43:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the Deku Tree.
[0:43:57] <%QueequegTheater> Because shut up, it's a tree
[0:44:00] <%Double_Tap_That> @devanmuse Don't get your hopes up.
[0:44:07] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @devanmuse Like 2 or 3 hours
[0:44:07] <%dukenux> Why theres a sequoia in the main hall
[0:44:07] <@commanderclaw> Don't worry about Ygrassil over there
[0:44:08] <%QueequegTheater> Where's the All Might tree then
[0:44:17] <TalekAetem> Research has a lot of encounters for some reason
[0:44:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Was that a willhelm scream?
[0:44:26] <%whiskey_wolfe_> you guys realize this is what Death Stranding is going to be right?
[0:44:27] <Marpolo13> @QueequegTheater booooooo
[0:44:27] <kartanonperuna> Honestly I think the only guns that suck is CHARGE and maybe PIERCE
[0:44:30] <Merbstrom> It's like the borg but with a catchy song instead of nanites.
[0:44:31] <Daxalog> last did?
[0:44:31] <%dukenux> oh god there are TWO
[0:44:36] <%crimsonharvest> youre welcome
[0:44:36] <Soul_Intern> Bless you @crimsonharvest
[0:44:38] <%Calek> I won't be surprised if this is better than Death Stranding
[0:44:42] <%Batophobe> Batophobe subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:44:48] <WoodenTarkus> Pierce is fucking busted OP with mods
[0:44:53] <%BioApple> how could this be better, you can't even pee on a mushroom
[0:44:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @whiskey_wolfe_ n-no. it's gonna have political intrigue too!
[0:44:55] <%Aeoneth> Pierce is so good
[0:44:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Sorry we doubted you Crimson
[0:44:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @kartanonperuna Charge and Pierce are very very useful for a small number of late-game enemies but they're nearly useless for Hiss soldiers.
[0:44:58] <%crimsonharvest> now while i have your attention let me tell about all my favorite shit
[0:45:03] <@commanderclaw> Oh yeah, fuck yeah
[0:45:04] <Patzzki217> pierce would have been good if it didnt have the glitch where you cant upgrade it
[0:45:05] <kartanonperuna> This probably will end up having better combat than Death Stranding at least
[0:45:05] <%reonome> uh oh
[0:45:06] <transporterthesequel> There is a % chance this is better than Death Stranding
[0:45:09] <%QueequegTheater> @Calek Well this game isn't an elaborate money laundering scheme disgusied as a game, so yeah
[0:45:09] <%dukenux> thats some fucking impressive gate
[0:45:09] <notToph> Calek even if it is, won't sell anywhere near as well sadly
[0:45:11] <$bootysteve> Dimensional research? Probably nothing fucking dire in there
[0:45:17] <Redpointshine> i just came in what the fuck game is this?
[0:45:22] <mayorrev> Is this the Max Payne VA?
[0:45:23] <RyuuAoi> Oh Pat! You and your fatal frames!
[0:45:25] <ZE_Count> Oh this is cool
[0:45:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Redpointshine Control

[0:45:40] <kartanonperuna> Oh boy the ash tray maze is great
[0:45:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Do you remember the Smoking Man from X-Files?
[0:45:43] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat did the voice actor of Fiss see you and Paige beat the game and keep her alive last stream?
[0:45:45] <ZE_Count> Check out the maze !
[0:45:46] <@commanderclaw> God this game is so fucking rad
[0:45:48] <Valdorick> The X-COM council!?
[0:45:49] <+brave_sj> That'll certainly break a finder
[0:45:49] <%QueequegTheater> @Redpointshine SCP shooter

[0:46:18] <kartanonperuna> License to kill...unlimited ammo
[0:46:23] <Soul_Intern> Man that whisper
[0:46:28] <%QueequegTheater> Maximilian is an SCP isn't he
[0:46:31] <deviljhojho94> max payne sure has a really max payne voice
[0:46:31] <kartanonperuna> I want my wife and baby girl back...
[0:46:36] <%InugamiTheHound> Did he voice max in Max Payne 3?
[0:46:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I want Sam Lake to have a podcast.
[0:46:38] <Soul_Intern> Woah
[0:46:41] <Soul_Intern> What the fuck

[0:46:52] <+brave_sj> You should get Paige to help with this
[0:46:53] <kartanonperuna> Dude, Max Payne has always been voiced by only one dude
[0:46:54] <MasterDecoder> Big maze
[0:46:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You will never pass through.
[0:46:57] <kartanonperuna> James Mcaffrey

[0:47:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Baba doesn't like that
[0:47:00] <samperson12345> lost woods time?

[0:47:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I can't confirm, but I wanna say the way through is a straight line. It's just nearly impossible to get that straight line without getting lost.
[0:47:44] <kartanonperuna> Cant do this yet

[0:48:23] <+OkamiDude15> what chapter we at?
[0:48:30] <%AncelDeLambert> And now we're inside Evil Within 2, wtf
[0:48:32] <%starotter70> Pat, you're gonna need to empty your pockets
[0:48:34] <@commanderclaw> I actually love how much of this shit gets explained somewhat in files
[0:48:34] <Smart_ZaK1> It lagged because it couldn't hand the girth

[0:52:03] <gekizenbu> the power of good vibes
[0:52:06] <%dukenux> You caused the Resonance Cascade, Gordon!
[0:52:07] <Marpolo13> maybe the Hiss are just misunderstood Kappa
[0:52:08] <WoodenTarkus> baaaad
[0:52:09] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s midachlorians
[0:52:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I wonder if this is the Dark Side of the Resonance?
[0:52:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> good good good good vibrations
[0:52:22] <Teyaric> That's actually him talking to Hedron - The hiss talker is... Different.

[0:53:40] <%joylent_blue> both this game and Astral Chain use the term Astral Plane and its confusing me

[0:53:40] <%starotter70> I mean I can't but still
[0:53:41] <shevan123> are these 4d cubes?

[0:55:49] <ape_hawk> what the hell is Quantum Break?
[0:55:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why does the character look like Claire from Resident Evil Revelations 2?
[0:55:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nothing, that's why they got taken over.
[0:55:59] <ape_hawk> sounds like some lame thing they casted Ice Man in
[0:56:04] <duskrush> Quantum Break was a weird TV show game
[0:56:11] <%dalmek> Hazmat suits exist solely to avoid an embarrassing death by mundane radiation
[0:56:13] <MasterDecoder> @Djinnazz He can't [REDACTED] yet
[0:56:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @Breakfast_Megapowers because that character design archetype is hot as hell
[0:56:16] <%shadowace2400> is that the date of your characters incident?
[0:56:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat thats the year Matrix came out I think

[0:57:52] <+OkamiDude15> the death smoke looks like that thing that happens when you go out of world into the void so every frame of animation just layers on top of one another but more subdued

[0:58:02] <duskrush> Those searchlights went bankrupt
[0:58:09] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat Have they explained why you, the Director of the Bureau, still don't have the highest security clearance in the FBC and can't see any of these documents without the black bars all over them?
[0:58:13] <+tuesti> why do i feel like i haven't seen a game like this since like 2010-ish (not in a bad way, but i mean like when games like this came out often, idk what i mean by this)

[0:59:44] <+brave_sj> @Calek @MasterDecoder But these Hiss reports are apparently being compiled by her order, they shouldn't have anything redacted for her
[1:00:08] <WoodenTarkus> That alliteration

[1:00:12] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Are you going to check out the direct tomorrow or nah?
[1:00:18] <%Calek> @brave_sj when she became director, any reference to the acting director, even pictures of the acting director changed to her as soon as she picked up the gun
[1:00:21] <%NeroInfinite> more weird mold shit

[1:01:55] <$GoogleyGareth> Physics fucking RULE
[1:01:56] <deviljhojho94> Fuck furniture
[1:01:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> That Carla bitch is running STRAIGHT for HR
[1:01:58] <duskrush> Too bad there's not object of power to counteract cringeworthy workplace interactions
[1:01:59] <+brave_sj> @Calek All the pictures of Trench changed, but stuff written by him a credited to him stayed. The Hiss reports are new, written by Emliy, by order of Jesse according to the reports
[1:02:01] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Jakracer that too
[1:02:02] <%wsintai> What a LOSER
[1:02:06] <%crimsonharvest> in case you haven't heard that idiom, "dont shit where you eat" means dont fuck your coworkers
[1:02:06] <$valriot> Do that on PS4 and the game probably crashes
[1:02:10] <%NeroInfinite> Thatis big weird
[1:02:14] <derekwst3> Nintendo direct in 21 hours
[1:02:22] <%filialpails> regular dead bodies? boooring
[1:02:32] <%Calek> @brave_sj oh I see, they're still classified though and I'm sure Emily knows that, she's doing her best
[1:02:33] <%Bad1uck> @duskrush I'm sure the Hiss put a stop to all of that
[1:02:35] <%NeroInfinite> you went in a circle
[1:02:36] <$GoogleyGareth> CHARLES
[1:02:37] <%MegboyManuel> i love how normal dead bodies is the weird thing here

[1:02:41] <+Javaa01> There was a door you could go into next to the Shelter
[1:02:46] <$valriot> Proffesor X PogChamp
[1:02:47] <%Laecerelius> fucking chair bois making noise
[1:02:48] <%NeroInfinite> ah wheel chair man
[1:02:50] <%crimsonharvest> flying dudes can dodge but they can't dodge continually
[1:02:53] <SparkAfterDark> I'd say take it to the HR department but they're actually in charge of spending human life as a resource, not mediating social disputes
[1:02:54] <Marpolo13> Prof x being a shit again I see
[1:02:56] <%PanicSwytch> Are they sitting on chairs?

[1:04:21] <$GoogleyGareth> Must be
[1:04:22] <WoodenTarkus> Pat, your test results indicate that you have cancer

[1:12:00] <@commanderclaw> Dash is an option to break your fall
[1:12:01] <Marpolo13> bummer
[1:12:04] <%Aeoneth> Death averted
[1:12:04] <+SCMike00> I hope the game difficulty increases based on how cruel you were to toilet chan
[1:12:04] <%NeroInfinite> "man the apocalypse is contained in my work place time to take apoop."
[1:12:05] <Djinnazz> Gotta bullshit your way down.

[1:12:14] <%BioApple> @GeneralSCPatton toilet pat is an OoP, it confers Crazy Talk on whoever sits on it
[1:12:14] <WoodenTarkus> Air dash cancels fall dmg
[1:12:15] <Teyaric> yeah but the mold area is way later overall
[1:12:19] <chaos2frozen> you can use dash to kill your fall speed
[1:12:20] <%ArcanumMBD> There's nothing down there until he gets another keycard though
[1:12:23] <Teyaric> cant do quests and mobs are higher level

[1:13:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't Astral Chain, you have a jump button.

[1:14:47] <%Boscuito> its so satisfying to get them on the backswing
[1:14:48] <Rosy_Joan> I just realized this combat style is just like Infamous for the PS3.
[1:14:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> SHIT. It IS Taco Tuesday. I keep forgetting
[1:14:50] <%floralkami> @arfsm95 the music plays, regardless of the copyright settings, but every streamer cuts it off 15-20 seconds in cause it doesn't sound generic.
[1:14:53] <%ArcanumMBD> @arfsm95 it's basically just an extended lore file, cause the questionnaire note in the room heavily implies it's an Altered Object
[1:14:57] <%ChaosAethr> NOPE

[1:16:52] <Smart_ZaK1> Astral Plane crossover
[1:16:54] <Marpolo13> evil pyramid
[1:17:02] <WoodenTarkus> Yes
[1:17:07] <%dukenux> Yes
[1:17:07] <+harpsichord_uiy> I do love the 1960s science angle though

[1:17:10] <%starotter70> yes
[1:17:10] <@lewdskeletor13> He looks younger here
[1:17:11] <Soul_Intern> Yes :)
[1:17:15] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat apperently you can launch things from behind enemies, it doesn't need to be close to you
[1:17:16] <mesamus> the director can control the scps?
[1:17:17] <Rosy_Joan> Yes :)
[1:17:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Fuck
[1:17:31] <Smart_ZaK1> Yes?
[1:17:39] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[1:17:40] <Teyaric> Her launch power is a floppy disk
[1:17:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Become as GODS
[1:17:43] <@commanderclaw> Aw yeah, rocket launcher and sniper
[1:17:43] <ape_hawk> get charge
[1:17:45] <%Calek> the director can't control all SCP's just able to bind some of them to her
[1:17:46] <Teyaric> her gun is made of cubes
[1:17:47] <WoodenTarkus> Pierce PogChamp
[1:17:49] <Soul_Intern> @mesamus They LET them control
[1:17:57] <Teyaric> the shield is made of a safe
[1:17:58] <Mister_McDerp> pierce is good
[1:17:58] <%Bad1uck> @mesamus The Director pretty much is an SC0
[1:18:00] <mastermidget23> PIEEERCE
[1:18:02] <%InugamiTheHound> Bruce from FunHaus is leaving
[1:18:03] <%NeroInfinite> pierce
[1:18:03] <astrophizz> pierce is like sniper
[1:18:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> the cubes are made of bees
[1:18:05] <Teyaric> flying is made from a tv
[1:18:06] <@commanderclaw> Pierce is a boss killer
[1:18:06] <%Bad1uck> er SCP
[1:18:06] <astrophizz> charge is... cool
[1:18:07] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @mesamus Only certain ones called oops
[1:18:07] <+gatoralus> pierce is big strong
[1:18:08] <grayjammer> Charge Kreygasm
[1:18:10] <$valriot> Honestly, I found Grip to be the only really useful one
[1:18:13] <%Aeoneth> Ritual Impulse only drops on Maintenance Sector
[1:18:15] <Jontman42> Pierce sounds good
[1:18:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pierce
[1:18:16] <WoodenTarkus> Pierce is a railgun Kreygasm
[1:18:16] <ape_hawk> charge is a rocket launcher
[1:18:18] <Soul_Intern> Upgrade your Grip
[1:18:18] <Teyaric> pierce is waste!
[1:18:20] <+csisson147> Pierce
[1:18:21] <Soul_Intern> Please
[1:18:24] <%Razputin217> Grenade launcher or sniper?
[1:18:25] <Teyaric> IT CANT BE UPGRADED YOU FOOL ITS BUGGED
[1:18:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pierce the Veil
[1:18:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Directors don't control SCPs, that's why they direct spyCappa
[1:18:31] <chaos2frozen> pierce is better than charge imo, more uses
[1:18:33] <@lewdskeletor13> I haven’t gotten Pierce in my game yet
[1:18:33] <Soul_Intern> Nooooo :(
[1:18:35] <grayjammer> Pierce is unupgradable though
[1:18:55] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat after finishing the game i can tell you is like dead space, the best gun is the basic pistol
[1:18:55] <Djinnazz> Yeah, it's a bug
[1:18:56] <%Calek> it's still an amazing weapon at level 1 though
[1:18:59] <SixthSun2> Did he equip?
[1:19:01] <Patzzki217> @grayjammer That's a bug

[1:27:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shevan123 Yeah, this thing eats thought energy, and lives in a plane seemingly made of thought energy. No amount of cardboard will stop it from going "This place isn't made of food, REEEEEEEEE!"
[1:27:36] <%augusm> pretty sure pat only plays on consoles when there is no PC option
[1:27:40] <%augusm> w

[1:27:48] <%BioApple> well the pc option in this is epic
[1:28:06] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat apperently you can launch things from behind enemies, it doesn't need to be close to you
[1:28:08] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is indeed cool
[1:28:08] <Valdorick> Vanilla Ice was the vampire, the stand was Cream
[1:28:12] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes

[1:29:47] <%wizkid50000> Pat, have you heard of The Lost Room? This game seems very inspired from it, even down to the Motel!
[1:29:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> There was a terrorist in that movie

[1:31:00] <Ner234> Letting go old staff
[1:31:01] <Djinnazz> Finx
[1:31:01] <Marpolo13> rough week at the office
[1:31:02] <%dekkitout> Time for a 'surprise inspection'
[1:31:05] <draggy2140> pat really getting into that CEO role
[1:31:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> New boss sounds a lot like the old boss.
[1:31:06] <Soul_Intern> He just demands
[1:31:13] <+CammyEXE> mfw Pat is a union-buster and the Hiss is just unionizers from the perspective of upper management
[1:31:15] <deviljhojho94> you are fired
[1:31:16] <@lewdskeletor13> Is this game just about Telltale
[1:31:21] <Ner234> Severance pay is a bullet
[1:31:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> PEARCE
[1:31:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie fuckin oof. I hope thats a joke
[1:31:33] <%AncelDeLambert> impact effects and sound design are REALLY good in this game
[1:31:40] <UltraDeak> Jodie Foster is good in it and there is some really cool visual effects. not just the space stuff
[1:31:42] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That is the sickest GUN ever. Imagine what Adamska could do with that thing
[1:31:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker It's totally a joke. Just felt like being edgy today
[1:31:59] <deviljhojho94> when is pat going to learn gunkata?
[1:32:02] <Ner234> It's impressive how well it works
[1:32:05] <@lewdskeletor13> @garbagequeenellie Don’t lie, that’s you every day
[1:32:09] <SixthSun2> He got dead
[1:32:13] <chronoxgp> if i had telekinisis i'd make them shoot each other
[1:32:21] <ape_hawk> jesse is just a cooler version of jean gray, really
[1:32:25] <Smart_ZaK1> Hiss Daddies
[1:32:25] <vexion_smh> that dodge tho
[1:32:26] <%AncelDeLambert> getting telekinesis to work properly as a mechanic in a game isn't easy
[1:32:27] <ape_hawk> not that that's hard to do...
[1:32:28] <+grim_abel> HEAL ORBS
[1:32:29] <+gatoralus> remedy nailed it in this game
[1:32:31] <Djinnazz> or the Apprentise
[1:32:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @deviljhojho94 The only cool thing to come out of Equilibrium
[1:32:34] <UltraDeak> how far in this game is he?
[1:32:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> @lewdskeletor13 True. Sometimes I gotta sharpen it for extra effect
[1:32:35] <%MelBrooksKA> horbs
[1:32:38] <%dukenux> i can't unhear Piss Clusters
[1:32:39] <%dekkitout> I like to think this office has a guy like Bret from Archer, always -somehow- getting shot
[1:32:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie You sure got me
[1:32:55] <%MachoMadnesss94> combat in this game is super fun
[1:32:57] <%1matheuw> games dedicated to a single super power are the best
[1:33:12] <Shwepie> The biggest part to making it just work is it autotargets both your pick up and your throw to a greater extent you would expect. It really helps a lot.
[1:33:20] <@lewdskeletor13> This makes me want a new Infamous
[1:33:24] <%mister___doctor> Never trust anyone in fiction who says "quite interesting"
[1:33:24] <shevan123> yeah capture the alien orb of freeform telekenetic force, just like you tried to pretend you were in an alien dimension with cardboard
[1:33:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> no
[1:33:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I want a new infamous
[1:33:35] <%floralkami> @Sphincter_Spelunker i expected you to be used to shit.
[1:33:36] <Djinnazz> oh, THAT thing.
[1:33:39] <%1matheuw> heck yeah a new infamous would be sick
[1:33:41] <ape_hawk> its close by and easy to get
[1:33:47] <ape_hawk> do it
[1:33:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Not with Desmond red hat tho
[1:33:49] <Jontman42> That's a big brain slice
[1:33:50] <%Calek> you picked up a side quests that's all
[1:33:54] <%MachoMadnesss94> map
[1:33:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker I've never even been to summer camp. I'd much rather stay home and play vidya games
[1:33:58] <UltraDeak> I really liked the last infamous
[1:33:59] <+emperri> fuck you documents
[1:33:59] <Marpolo13> SUPER classified
[1:34:00] <%dekkitout> Infamous, but this time with stands Kappa

[1:35:05] <TheMorilo> Morphogenetic fields
[1:35:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Morphogenetic field @AngriestPat
[1:35:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie but viddy games make da kids violent. not like rap music, or movies or novels before it. damn kids

[1:35:14] <@lewdskeletor13> @calek I’d rather have a new protag but I wouldn’t complain
[1:35:16] <%floralkami> The only thing that really sucked about the last infamous were the endings
[1:35:23] <xcompleasedad> @Calek By saying that, you recognize the superiority of him as a protagonist, and are thus a "better" fan.
[1:35:25] <ZE_Count> Thats progress pat go back

[1:35:37] <+emperri> Luck department? Sounds nice
[1:35:37] <%starotter70> AKA Shifting or something in ZTD
[1:35:40] <ape_hawk> LUCK is a good department
[1:35:45] <%filialpails> that's where they store RNGesus
[1:35:45] <Djinnazz> Make charge!
[1:35:47] <xcompleasedad> @Calek Assuming that they bring back shadow boy from Seattle.
[1:35:49] <fusedforms> countermeasures?
[1:35:50] <%BioApple> Director Ted of the Luck Dept.
[1:35:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker On the plus side, they also made da kids lazy, so even if they are violent, they're too fat and tired to do anything about it.
[1:35:52] <astrophizz> charge is fun
[1:35:52] <+Caped_Eggy> Put all stats in luck
[1:35:52] <@lewdskeletor13> I wanna work in that department
[1:35:53] <%Laecerelius> I'm assuming those drop from different areas?
[1:35:54] <%Aeoneth> Ritual Impulses are only found in the maintenance Sector

[1:36:11] <SixthSun2> Man, I wonder if assembling the brain pieces does anything
[1:36:13] <%Laecerelius> Oops! All Ted!
[1:36:15] <@commanderclaw> Aw yeah
[1:36:16] <%InugamiTheHound> I like infamous 1 and never played infamous 2. I heard that game was good. Infamous second son didn't look good with troy baker as MC
[1:36:21] <ShichiNoBushi> You're OCD enough. You don't need any more ritualistic impulses.
[1:36:21] <@commanderclaw> Got back just in time

[1:37:09] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat this oop is protecting itself from the hiss

[1:47:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Literally hadn't heard of it until you started streaming it
[1:47:02] <RupanSen> Quantum Payne
[1:47:03] <Rosy_Joan> That smoke effect is actually amazing
[1:47:03] <jeffishype> Well, the game is sort of selling itself via word of mouth
[1:47:03] <+Vex831> lol
[1:47:04] <%AncelDeLambert> it's because it's Epic AND they didn't market properly
[1:47:06] <%dekkitout> Now I want a Quantum Wake game...

[1:47:28] <astrophizz> they die on their own
[1:47:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You can take over the explodey boys too by the way. It's tough to get their health down without instantly killing them though.

[1:57:31] <Djinnazz> Lucky Ted has DED.
[1:57:32] <xcompleasedad> CRAZY TALK WILL REMEMBER THIS
[1:57:32] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat it's a puzzle you can't access until you have level 5 keycard
[1:57:33] <%Agami23> if its up, it stores luck. its like a filling cup
[1:57:33] <%starotter70> Do you not know about the horseshoe?
[1:57:34] <%filialpails> cold iron keeps out the fairies!
[1:57:35] <%dukenux> the luck falls out if its upside down
[1:57:35] <%MakotoPB> just keep touching everything
[1:57:38] <%Bad1uck> look at the whiteboard
[1:57:40] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Puzzle in other room
[1:57:42] <%dukenux> it's perfectly logical
[1:57:44] <%dekkitout> I wombo, you wombo, he/she/we wombo...
[1:57:45] <%Aeoneth> ritual is the next area
[1:57:49] <+Jonesman64> luck all over the floor like jizz in a hotel room
[1:57:51] <solvidur> next area
[1:57:53] <%miguelrod777> horseshoe luck myth is super old
[1:57:55] <Ner234> Do people actually know what that does or are we just fucking with Pat?
[1:57:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If you turn it upside down it can't catch falling luck
[1:57:58] <%mrvidicus> Hellloooo everyooooooone
[1:58:05] <%floralkami> @Binary_Fireball people who usually seen some shit get written like that. At least the same wasn't their for other character models we met.
[1:58:06] <%grayjammer> you were literally nearly there dude
[1:58:08] <%worldbrand> @GreggyGallz I didn't get a good look, but some kind of aviator jacket I think
[1:58:26] <%Teintstein> you can actually seize the hiss nodes and they'll heal you and your allies, it's actually rad
[1:58:28] <+Binary_Fireball> I now wonder what she has seen
[1:58:29] <42nfl19> Wait I just joined. WHen did pat get a convert power? and what was the item?
[1:58:30] <%starotter70> @mrvidicus hey
[1:58:31] <%madmanrambler> madmanrambler subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! woo, 7 months
[1:58:31] <Ner234> That gun is mean LUL
[1:58:34] <%Shadicara> Woah look at that sweet X Buster PogChamp
[1:58:40] <+Binary_Fireball> did she see pat pee poops?
[1:58:49] <draggy2140> IT HEAL
[1:58:58] <+Snirtax> Absolute potato aim right there
[1:59:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat if a horseshoe is the wrong way it spills the stored luck
[1:59:13] <%grayjammer> Evil Ball
[1:59:15] <Shwepie> I like how if the object you grab hits an enemy on the way to your hand it hurts the enemy. A very nice touch.
[1:59:31] <%worldbrand> luck is two dimensional and only interacts with equine footwear
[1:59:34] <%Teintstein> @42nfl19 there's an object of power in research that gives you the power - it's called "Seize"
[1:59:40] <+Estuko> this game seems REALLY cool
[1:59:40] <%BioApple> how did the scholars know whether luck was lighter or heavier than air?
[1:59:41] <%Shadicara> I see pat's defense is still nothing but offence LUL
[1:59:44] <LoneFonte> can you seize the orb?
[1:59:52] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:59:58] <Djinnazz> not yet.
[2:00:00] <Soul_Intern> @LoneFonte Thats a good question
[2:00:02] <42nfl19> @Teintstein What was the object?
[2:00:03] <+emperri> look at this fucking magritte painting
[2:00:03] <%dukenux> Seize the means of luck production
[2:00:04] <%Teintstein> eventually, yes
[2:00:12] <%dekkitout> I demand orb yeeting
[2:00:12] <+grim_abel> If luck was heavy birds would be super lucky
[2:00:13] <%Teintstein> @42nfl19 an x-ray thing
[2:00:14] <%hawk_rush> seize the day
[2:00:24] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Shoeboxes can't become altered items
[2:00:27] <%Teintstein> seize and launch were my jam
[2:00:29] <Frolomeo> When’s warframe?
[2:00:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @Shadicara so basically a glass cannon aka jack up 3s all the time
[2:00:32] <%BioApple> very cool
[2:00:36] <Djinnazz> Fuck you they can't
[2:00:36] <%crimsonharvest> I love all this raw concrete, i live in a town that was built for the manhattan project and there's tons of federal buildings in the brutalist style
[2:00:42] <RupanSen> PAINE Electronics lol
[2:00:43] <%hawk_rush> shoeboxes are so altered they cannot be altered items
[2:00:44] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> can you seize strong enemies???
[2:00:45] <Soul_Intern> @flyingavocadosofdoom Tell that to the Sock Goblin
[2:00:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @flyingavocadosofdoom it could contain memories
[2:00:52] <%grayjammer> Seize-style powers are always my favourite. its fun to turn enemies against eachother
[2:01:07] <%Teintstein> @DesuDesuDokiDoki eventually
[2:01:11] <Marpolo13> good wholesome MURDER
[2:01:15] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[2:01:17] <@commanderclaw> It's fine
[2:01:19] <ZE_Count> go help them
[2:01:20] <%Laecerelius> I've noticed you keep getting the same material drops here so different areas might drop different materials?
[2:01:22] <%Shadicara> Look at that molten EVIL

[2:05:44] <butthurtdave> heck i'm late, did Pat already talk about Rajang?
[2:05:44] <jeffishype> @AngriestPat kind of a long shot, but if you had to reccomend a pc for under 500$ for someone looking to mostly do work and play older games (WoW Classic, as an example) What would you suggest, alternatively just tell me to look it up myself

[2:12:42] <%hawk_rush> no, just remember
[2:12:43] <Djinnazz> no, you just gotta remember.
[2:12:44] <%MachoMadnesss94> @angriestpat some areas of this game let you find and complete them before it tells you about them, other let you find but not complete them until later, others you can’t find until the game wants you to
[2:12:48] <%Stratiotai2> they dont have skeletons, nothing for paige to see here
[2:12:48] <%Boscuito> when you have higher clearance
[2:12:50] <Cherokia666> Not everything
[2:12:51] <+gatoralus> yeah side quest
[2:12:51] <+SirSamVimes> you don't gotta remember, there will be a mission for it
[2:12:52] <%Teintstein> just gotta remember that there are doors you can't access yet
[2:12:52] <%Aeoneth> Nah it's a sidequest, but you can't do it till you get the Lv6 card
[2:12:57] <%Shadicara> Pat will forget immediately
[2:13:09] <Marpolo13> very nice and stylish evil
[2:13:10] <%Aeoneth> you'll pic up a think like you did for the Xray lightbox and that will give you the sidemission
[2:13:14] <%ChaosAethr> Is it me or is the Stream studdering

[2:15:10] <%worldbrand> @SirSamVimes totally agree, and it's a smart decision to pair it with the space-distorting extrusions in hiss controlled areas. they go together very well

[2:34:47] <%worldbrand> wait were they mining the astral plane from astral chain?
[2:34:48] <%Teintstein> the next environment is super neat
[2:34:49] <Marpolo13> EVIL
[2:34:50] <%Mr_Strut> Is this where they found the marker?
[2:34:50] <%Maids4lyfe> all that is in doors
[2:34:51] <VirtuaRailith> they are mining space crystals
[2:34:52] <bear_breaker20> That dudes acting is asmr tier tbh
[2:34:53] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp
[2:34:53] <%Zalthia> Uh?
[2:34:56] <solvidur> Mirror Room open now
[2:34:56] <%IronGlorfindel> oh that's some interplanar shit right there
[2:34:57] <FunkyStreams> are they searching for a marker or something?
[2:34:58] <cureneckbeard> see this is why the SCP keeps its Keter shit in separate bases
[2:34:58] <Cherokia666> nope
[2:34:58] <%Maids4lyfe> what mistake?
[2:34:59] <%Cthulos> guess what the mcguffin caused the hiss!!!!
[2:35:00] <%Aeoneth> NOpe, a preview
[2:35:01] <astrophizz> it's right
[2:35:05] <+SirSamVimes> @solvidur no it's not, he needs level 6
[2:35:06] <%Calek> Matthew Poretta's voice is silky smooth on the ears
[2:35:08] <Trash_leviathan> its the chess puzzle from RE2 remake @AngriestPat
[2:35:08] <astrophizz> you can also watch it in collectibles
[2:35:10] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat bad ending unlocked
[2:35:13] <shevan123> you ever see the void, pat?
[2:35:27] <%hawk_rush> the previews are always nice, love they include them
[2:35:28] <Djinnazz> don't worry about them.
[2:35:28] <tank7013> I can't believe the hiss is corruption
[2:35:29] <Zombrocom> Thats the clever part! You cant tell whats a fuck up and whats ART
[2:35:29] <%Teintstein> it's fine - they don't go away
[2:35:31] <%Aeoneth> its fine, shit's all junk
[2:35:32] <%Laecerelius> two are in the executive area and one's in the maintenance area, Pat
[2:35:33] <+gatoralus> i didn't do that many of them it doesn't really matter pat
[2:35:37] <%Calek> @AngriestPat Board Counter Measures are random and infinite don't worry about them
[2:35:37] <+SirSamVimes> honestly for countermeasures you can just abandon them until you have a set that applies for your next zone
[2:35:38] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat red/blue/yellow house is where you got a bunch of elements presented and you have to sort them into a proper order. like each house has a car, a person living in it, and something on the porch and the puzzle gives clues to some of the locations like rules. example being the milk man lives next to the blue house, and the red house has a bucket on the porch.
[2:35:41] <TheSinner42> has Pat been rewatching those? they are longer and have more stuff
[2:35:43] <jacknerik> this reminds me a lot of evil within 2
[2:35:47] <%Laecerelius> You're not in the areas to do those quests
[2:35:48] <Valdorick> Dark Shouls shortcuts
[2:35:49] <mayorrev> ooooh
[2:35:50] <Soul_Intern> Big shortcut
[2:35:55] <%Shadicara> Was that a guy just floating up there
[2:36:00] <Marpolo13> yes
[2:36:05] <+SirSamVimes> @Shadicara yeah they're all over the place
[2:36:07] <Soul_Intern> @Shadicara Yeah hes chilling
[2:36:08] <%Maids4lyfe> you need to rewatch the video logs pat, they're longer and more detailed in the menu
[2:36:10] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat you can dismantle mods anywhere
[2:36:11] <+SirSamVimes> @Shadicara just floating and chanting ominous shit
[2:36:12] <cureneckbeard> use your floppy disk to pull him down
[2:36:17] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I thought the red house blue house yellow house riddle was "what is a green house made out of"
[2:36:18] <%IronGlorfindel> @Shadicara Welcome to the stream
[2:36:24] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Also, rewatch that.
[2:36:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> who lives in the white house @bevyrage The president cmonBruh
[2:36:36] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat there's a room you can open in central executive now
[2:36:49] <%MachoMadnesss94> more magic
[2:36:53] <%Laecerelius> Floating people are hiss infected but aren't combat capable and if the MC tries to heal them they just disintegrate
[2:36:58] <%Aeoneth> 1 room
[2:37:04] <astrophizz> just up the stairs, near security scanner
[2:37:05] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat how long do you think the stream will be?
[2:37:10] <+Grizzytron> countermeasures never seemed worth it for me because they kept offering common/uncommon stuff, or maybe rare, when I was already getting stuff much better
[2:37:11] <+emperri> you used to call me FeelsBadMan
[2:37:15] <%bevyrage> @Sphincter_Spelunker >:U
[2:37:30] <%Shadicara> I don't recall the floating people but it's been a bit since in a control stream
[2:37:30] <+SirSamVimes> Casper Darling is pretty cute ngl
[2:37:33] <%InugamiTheHound> memory is the key
[2:37:44] <MasterDecoder> @SirSamVimes Oh just you wait
[2:37:46] <FunkyStreams> @iswearimjustdandy longer than you'd thing but shorter than you'd hope.
[2:37:47] <%Shadicara> Woah real person what
[2:37:51] <+FilthyHereticHorus> I bet vibration is the key ;}
[2:37:54] <%dekkitout> Can you hear the sound of science
[2:37:56] <@lewdskeletor13> He is getting more unhinged every video
[2:38:01] <+SirSamVimes> @MasterDecoder I've completed the game, I know what you're talking about LUL
[2:38:02] <+Grizzytron> I think the darling vids aren't extended when watched from the collectables menu, except for one or two cases where the game cuts away
[2:38:08] <cureneckbeard> oh no gordon freeman get out of there
[2:38:09] <fusedforms> is Hedron his Polaris?
[2:38:10] <+Jonesman64> .. is that not cgi? is that actual person video?
[2:38:10] <%grayjammer> I usually just refresh all the countermeasures until there's worthwhile jobs i want to do
[2:38:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> You alright there bud?
[2:38:15] <Djinnazz> This guy does such a great job.
[2:38:15] <%dekkitout> Expose him!
[2:38:15] <+Jonesman64> that's great
[2:38:19] <%Calek> it's live action yeah
[2:38:19] <%Teintstein> @Jonesman64 ya he real
[2:38:22] <+SirSamVimes> @Jonesman64 yeah this is live action
[2:38:23] <MasterDecoder> @SirSamVimes Ok, I can't wait till it comes up
[2:38:26] <+BillyWimblett> @MasterDecoder HEH
[2:38:26] <Soul_Intern> He's looking to the side a lot
[2:38:27] <+Jonesman64> more games need to do that
[2:38:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> An SCP happens when Gordon Freeman talks
[2:38:29] <+Grizzytron> the trench bits are definitely longer/unedited though
[2:38:29] <TheMorilo> This actor is so great
[2:38:29] <%Shadicara> Like all scientists getting crazier by the moment
[2:38:34] <rubbishbinge> This man is definitely a Friend of Freq
[2:38:49] <%hawk_rush> @rubbishbinge FoFs, unite!
[2:38:51] <%MachoMadnesss94> I think the only things that have extra info in them when you watch them are the hotlines @angriestpat, but I don’t know for sure
[2:38:55] <+SirSamVimes> THis is the guy who played Alan Wake, so I guess Remedy like using him
[2:38:57] <Marpolo13> ooook
[2:38:57] <Valdorick> He's Cash Money Yachts?
[2:39:01] <+Estuko> @rubbishbinge He's waiting for his friend Eric Sparrow to come back.
[2:39:12] <cureneckbeard> oh there's a cube behind him
[2:39:40] <+Estuko> The Time Cube Cannot Be Defeated
[2:39:45] <%dekkitout> "They saying something about.. 'Benois'...."
[2:39:53] <%worldbrand> is it like cosmic background radiation but evil?
[2:39:55] <%Zalthia> @angriestpat Thanks for talking about OCD btw. It’s reassuring to me that I’m not the only one. I mean, I KNOW that, but it still feels nice.
[2:40:29] <%Laecerelius> absolute?
[2:40:31] <+emperri> absolute mod
[2:40:32] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> The Hiss corrupts people by strategically dropping its mixtape.
[2:40:34] <%Laecerelius> Is that good?
[2:40:35] <%grayjammer> You're gonna be in maintenance if that helps any
[2:40:36] <+emperri> the size of this mod
[2:40:38] <%Laecerelius> We you want that?
[2:40:38] <+SirSamVimes> It's cool how this game's lore document about OCD and rituals seemed to be well-researched as far as the terminology goes, at least if AngriestPat's reactions were anything to go by
[2:40:48] <%hawk_rush> upstairs
[2:40:49] <%thegreenbenis> apatGoblin

[2:40:59] <%hawk_rush> this area
[2:41:04] <mayorrev> boolshet
[2:41:09] <Djinnazz> Oh yeah, POST'd NOTES
[2:41:09] <Marpolo13> that ain't their job LUL
[2:41:09] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Sticky notes upstairs
[2:41:13] <%grayjammer> shut up about mirror thats clearance level 6
[2:41:17] <jacknerik> ok
[2:41:17] <%worldbrand> NOT A MIMIC
[2:41:18] <+Estuko> FAkINg BooLSHeeeT
[2:41:19] <Ner234> NOPE
[2:41:19] <+zaworldo> Holy shit
[2:41:20] <%starotter70> WOAH
[2:41:20] <+SirSamVimes> what an extremely normal room
[2:41:20] <%Dr_Mooose> ummm
[2:41:21] <FunkyStreams> excuse me, I meant the reflection room.
[2:41:23] <%Zalthia> @sirsamvimes yeah. Rituals are actually what those behaviors are called
[2:41:23] <Djinnazz> NOT A MIMIC
[2:41:24] <+Pixel_Matt> monkaS
[2:41:24] <Soul_Intern> O K
[2:41:25] <+forlorncarton> the post-it node dimension
[2:41:26] <%MachoMadnesss94> Was that a prank or OoP?
[2:41:26] <%walternatorz> so that's where all the sticky notes went
[2:41:26] <Marpolo13> someone had A LOT of time
[2:41:29] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Did you ever find a power to go through the poison gas rooms yet?
[2:41:30] <%NeroInfinite> woah lodsa notes
[2:41:31] <%TDotGoat> I don't care for this carpet
[2:41:33] <%dekkitout> Find the note with the bomb deactivation code LUL
[2:41:37] <+Jonesman64> this is a... note worthy room
[2:41:42] <%Calek> @MachoMadnesss94 altered item
[2:41:43] <%Dr_Mooose> nope, nothing crazy here
[2:41:46] <%Zalthia> I feel like this defeats the point of sticky notes
[2:41:50] <wholewheat420> i love this so much
[2:41:51] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @42nfl19 That's later
[2:41:55] <%Shadicara> Don't forget to take notes pat
[2:41:56] <Teyaric> BTW, the upgrade your mods option is not an upgrade for your crafted mods, but for your global drop pool.
[2:41:57] <Marpolo13> @dekkitout if he went to the trouble of setting this up, I'd be impressed honestly LUL
[2:41:59] <+emperri> LUL
[2:42:03] <Djinnazz> un USABLE
[2:42:05] <%NeroInfinite> unusable
[2:42:06] <+YabbaTroll> unusabke
[2:42:08] <+Estuko> monkaS ?
[2:42:10] <%Zalthia> At least add some different colors!
[2:42:12] <%Dr_Mooose> damn sticky note SCP
[2:42:15] <%kujofire990> math
[2:42:16] <%Laecerelius> MAAAAATH?!
[2:42:17] <+SirSamVimes> the people who designed the environments in this game clearly had a ton of fun imo
[2:42:18] <jacknerik> cell phone? I thought this was the 50s
[2:42:18] <%worldbrand> that's a good way to get out of work
[2:42:19] <+Grizzytron> this is the real urban camo pattern
[2:42:21] <carrion_king_> Spooky sticky note ruined my office
[2:42:22] <%floralkami> Honestly, this could've been dealt with. I was hoping this room was FEATHERED in notes
[2:42:30] <@commanderclaw> That's the most harmless yet annoying thing
[2:42:32] <%dekkitout> That'd be a great set piece in a story- someone work that into a tabletop campaign tajC
[2:42:33] <%sl8r4l8r> Did you guys know that phoebe from F.R.I.E.N.D.S invented post-it notes?
[2:42:37] <%Calek> @jacknerik it takes place October 2019
[2:42:37] <%MachoMadnesss94> I imagine that office pranks in this place might actually really fuck with people
[2:42:37] <+SirSamVimes> @jacknerik set during modern times, but most modern technology doesn't work inside the Oldest House
[2:42:39] <%hawk_rush> guy just wanted to skip work LUL
[2:42:40] <mayorrev> i love how casual that message is
[2:42:42] <Cherokia666> Sticky Note Grey Goo
[2:42:43] <+Estuko> Reminds me of my senior prank what I did to my band director's office.
[2:42:52] <rkytek> So we full ray tracing on with dlss or? also is the stutter that win10 issue? cheers
[2:42:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @commanderclaw until they start duplicating inside of you
[2:42:56] <%floralkami> And that the notes have strong paper cuts
[2:42:57] <Marpolo13> @Estuko did you do that?
[2:43:09] <%bevyrage> i wonder why the guy didn't just put something on a sticky note and see if the thing gets duplicated too
[2:43:10] <mayorrev> "yeah uhhhhh there's some slight glitch in my office causing a sticky note to duplicate, can we get someone to fix this"
[2:43:12] <Teyaric> Oh this is nothing. The clocks dimention is worse. On accounta the clocks.
[2:43:16] <kingbaconcrispy> @jacknerik 50's? Why is she dressedlike that? I missed the beggining
[2:43:22] <%bevyrage> like dude is in an office yeah but he's in a science building
[2:43:32] <+Estuko> @Marpolo13 I hated him, I made a stupid poster and my friends printed it, and taped it everywhere.
[2:43:38] <Marpolo13> lol
[2:43:39] <+Grizzytron> did pat do the training course?
[2:43:41] <ZE_Count> Ge got missions
[2:43:42] <%NeroInfinite> It's midern day but most modern tech don't work in the building
[2:43:47] <%NeroInfinite> modern**
[2:43:48] <%Teintstein> I think this is set in October 2019
[2:43:50] <Djinnazz> @Teyaric Don't reminf me. so many clocks...
[2:43:55] <%miguelrod777> we're kinda stuck together bitch
[2:43:55] <MasterDecoder> Ahti is great
[2:44:02] <%bevyrage> the game is indeed set in 2019
[2:44:02] <%Laecerelius> yay!
[2:44:05] <+SirSamVimes> Ahti is a good Finn
[2:44:10] <%hawk_rush> perkele
[2:44:16] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat the signs are more useful than the map
[2:44:24] <%grayjammer> I love Ahti
[2:44:26] <%bevyrage> there's a cutscene where a guy says 'i've been here for 24 years' and we got a file that is dated back to like 1991
[2:44:27] <shevan123> i knew the material were abstractions
[2:44:27] <+Estuko> She wants it bad.
[2:44:28] <%Laecerelius> Yeah modern tech that goes into the building explodes because the building don't like new shit
[2:44:37] <+nekodelic> the frames
[2:44:46] <Broand> he wants the mindgoblins
[2:44:46] <carrion_king_> Just like real life
[2:44:54] <Pallion_> this game shiny
[2:45:00] <+Hugpls> Does anyone knowwhat TV pat has?
[2:45:00] <@commanderclaw> This area always fucks with me
[2:45:02] <%Teintstein> @flyingavocadosofdoom I heard that the map may have been a late addition (which is why it sucks) and that the game was originally built so players only navigated using signs
[2:45:07] <Marpolo13> sup
[2:45:08] <%Teintstein> which is why the signs are so good
[2:45:09] <ZE_Count> board

[2:46:23] <%grayjammer> Through NSC Coolant pumps.
[2:46:26] <+SirSamVimes> The signage in this game reminds me of what signage is like in actual government facilities, at least going by all my time and out of hospitals
[2:46:30] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat don't forget to bring the poop knife
[2:46:31] <ZE_Count> Go too coolant pumps!

[2:46:51] <%hawk_rush> yueah, map is super meh
[2:46:52] <%bevyrage> i think the guy said 'shit makes for more shit' with that phrase
[2:47:06] <%hawk_rush> should have had different maps for different floors
[2:47:13] <%Teintstein> apatBig brave
[2:47:13] <Teyaric> that suits the clog, honestly, bevyrage

[2:47:25] <+Estuko> @Ion_Laser people do that ?
[2:47:25] <ZE_Count> elevator
[2:47:28] <%bevyrage> @Teyaric oh no
[2:47:36] <Teyaric> CHECK MODS
[2:47:39] <ZE_Count> best gun
[2:47:40] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat IMPORTANT TIP, manual breathing should be turned on
[2:47:41] <TheSinner42> Yeah the map really sucks when it comes to navigating sometimes
[2:47:43] <%MachoMadnesss94> YEYEYE
[2:47:43] <Teyaric> Upgrade for mods is GLOBAL DROP not craft pool!
[2:47:46] <astrophizz> charge is fun
[2:47:46] <%Ion_Laser> @Estuko Not that I know of
[2:47:57] <+nekodelic> make CHARGE
[2:47:58] <+SirSamVimes> @Teyaric no it's not, it's just crafting
[2:47:59] <+Grizzytron> Is the patch out yet that fixes the upgrade unlocks?
[2:48:01] <+Estuko> @Ion_Laser o
[2:48:02] <%hawk_rush> headshot damage is super good
[2:48:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah every time you upgrade mods it upgrades the entire fucking loot drop table.
[2:48:11] <Teyaric> You upgrade enough its all legendaries
[2:48:15] <%Teintstein> upgrade your mod level and higher mods will drop
[2:48:16] <%bevyrage> yooooo that's neat
[2:48:17] <%Laecerelius> Huh
[2:48:29] <+SirSamVimes> I got Prime and Absolute mod drops without ever upgrading mods at the astral constructs thing
[2:48:39] <Monkeyweed21> fast travel
[2:48:46] <%MachoMadnesss94> You can upgrade the mod rarity @angriestpat that’s what they meant
[2:48:46] <Teyaric> I didn't get any till I upgraded it with a fervor, then nothing but. It's got influence.
[2:48:50] <+Grizzytron> he jobs for you now
[2:48:57] <mayorrev> damn
[2:48:58] <leothewhitelion> 3:47 here in the UK
[2:49:02] <%starotter70> oh
[2:49:11] <%grayjammer> Upgrading Mods is only for the Random Mod Crafting
[2:49:12] <Teyaric> yeah i have nothing BUT V mods
[2:49:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's possible to get high level drops without upgrading it but it's very rare to get good mods from basic enemies without it.
[2:49:13] <%Teintstein> @Grizzytron I had a bug with my game where I could never upgrade pierce, is that what you're talking about?
[2:49:21] <+Estuko> head pops are very satisfying when it results in a hard take down.
[2:49:30] <jeffishype> Can you shoot while throwing objects?
[2:49:31] <+gatoralus> i think upgrading the mods increases your chance of getting higher quality mod drops
[2:49:42] <+SirSamVimes> @Teintstein I think everyone has that bug
[2:49:45] <+Alig200> @Teintstein Yeah, that seems to be happening with alot of people with Pierce. I wasn't able to upgrade it on either my PC or PS4 runthrough.
[2:49:45] <astrophizz> just Hiss things
[2:49:45] <%Teintstein> oh
[2:49:47] <+Estuko> so is there no way to heal the corrupted lads?
[2:49:49] <+Grizzytron> @Teintstein yep. Got to end credits and never got to upgrade pierce
[2:49:50] <mayorrev> Wasnt there supposed to be buddies with guns nearby
[2:49:50] <+Surf_Zombie> This game looks legit. Is this a new release?
[2:50:02] <+SirSamVimes> @Estuko nope, the one time we tried to cleanse someone Hiss-corrupted they disintegrated
[2:50:02] <Teyaric> Very legit, very new
[2:50:02] <%hawk_rush> @Surf_Zombie yep, cam eout last week
[2:50:03] <Soul_Intern> @Surf_Zombie Yep
[2:50:06] <+Estuko> @Surf_Zombie Yes, Control is the name. It's PRETTY COOL
[2:50:09] <+Estuko> @SirSamVimes oh.
[2:50:13] <%MachoMadnesss94> @surf_zombie I think it’s pretty new and yeah it’s fun
[2:50:22] <%king_wragles> Ahti made a swear!
[2:50:25] <Valdorick> The old man is constipated, clean his pipes
[2:50:26] <+Surf_Zombie> Tyvm
[2:50:34] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> the clog
[2:50:40] <%MachoMadnesss94> Ahri gold
[2:50:41] <+Grizzytron> BLIND
[2:50:42] <@lewdskeletor13> When will Ahti be a boss
[2:50:45] <ZE_Count> turn around
[2:50:46] <%filialpails> is this just the same mission again? that's the same dialogue
[2:50:47] <%floralkami> Ahti
[2:50:48] <astrophizz> this smells like a bugged quest, same audio
[2:50:52] <TheAmazingClaytor> In a few words, what even is this game? Just got here and it's the first I'm ever seeing of it
[2:50:54] <%starotter70> The Janitor Hates clogs
[2:50:56] <Teyaric> He gets a damn good event later on
[2:50:57] <ZE_Count> 2nd floor pat
[2:51:01] <+GrateMan> I wonder if this is going to bring together the Remedy Cinematic Universe
[2:51:02] <%Hacerous> Hacerous subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:51:04] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @TheAmazingClaytor It's basically an SCP game
[2:51:07] <%Shadicara> sight stolen
[2:51:10] <%BioApple> @TheAmazingClaytor 70s SCP TPS
[2:51:10] <%hawk_rush> 2nd floor there's a door
[2:51:18] <+Grizzytron> door was to your right, you went left
[2:51:18] <ZE_Count> there is a door
[2:51:18] <Soul_Intern> Insight lost
[2:51:19] <fusedforms> @TheAmazingClaytor Janitor assistant simulator
[2:51:19] <+SirSamVimes> @GrateMan it does kind of, there's a ton of references to Alan Wake in this game
[2:51:21] <Teyaric> but naw, the "What a mess" series is mostly just repackages for points - but those poitns are huge, so, worth doing
[2:51:26] <Mister_McDerp> nice
[2:51:30] <mayorrev> shit damn
[2:51:32] <heroneiden> very floaty woman
[2:51:34] <Soul_Intern> And other swears

[2:51:37] <rkytek> STUTTAH
[2:51:40] <%MachoMadnesss94> This whole game is a real life scp that makes pat more and more blind

[2:52:16] <%starotter70> There's an actual Water Cooler
[2:52:20] <Djinnazz> It's a prop hunt.
[2:52:23] <TheAmazingClaytor> Wait holy shit, this IS some scp bullish
[2:52:24] <Soul_Intern> Shapeshifting object
[2:52:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Ion_Laser @Estuko Scrolling through chat. Woolie ate PB and Mozzarella sandwich because his cousin or someone ate them all the time. "Don't knock it until you try it."
[2:52:26] <%dekkitout> My glasses!
[2:52:29] <%Capta1n_H3nry> For anyone wondering what this game is, it's basically SCP
[2:52:35] <Torruun> So it's like a mimic from Prey
[2:52:36] <+Estuko> @Sphincter_Spelunker I'm knocking it
[2:52:45] <%MachoMadnesss94> Oh my god this game is scp prop hunt...

[2:53:53] <+greyfox747> I'm sure people have asked this question so many times, but good game?
[2:53:54] <+zaworldo> Why did they build these things at TK HEIGHT
[2:53:55] <%Macbutters86> Macbutters86 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:53:57] <Torruun> Ah yes. Just fucking yeet the battery at the wall plug. THAT'S safe.
[2:53:57] <mayorrev> this is a portal puzzle
[2:54:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Estuko Listen. You make a grilled cheese with fresh mozza. This is coming from the guy who hates eggs.
[2:54:23] <+SirSamVimes> @greyfox747 yes, very
[2:54:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> So is the crazy ass blur and smoke why this game chews resources like a motherfucker?
[2:54:33] <+greyfox747> nice
[2:54:36] <+Estuko> @Sphincter_Spelunker I loved eggs till I learned I was egg intolerant recently, my stomach cramped and my insides turned to molten lava. FeelsBadMan
[2:54:38] <+asgard147> "Maybe"
[2:54:48] <Soul_Intern> iT BLEEDS
[2:54:48] <Teyaric> Not really - the fog-bleed-effect works the same on super low
[2:54:50] <%Capta1n_H3nry> @Hunk_Of_Dunk I believe pat has RTX on as well
[2:54:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's a cat, so yes and no.
[2:54:54] <Teyaric> its basic hall of mirrors with small 3d
[2:54:59] <mayorrev> theyre totally gonna meet again
[2:55:00] <+nekodelic> was that it?
[2:55:03] <Teyaric> the real eater is the fog / lighting / reflection engine
[2:55:04] <%starotter70> Whenever I heard 'Clog", I think "Klogg" from The Neverhood
[2:55:04] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat the water for the pumps comes from a threshold
[2:55:06] <TheAmazingClaytor> That means you'll sincerely meet it again.
[2:55:06] <%InugamiTheHound> no funny remark?
[2:55:06] <%MachoMadnesss94> Poop
[2:55:09] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Wow, I totally just shit through the grate.
[2:55:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> "See ya in two chapters lady"
[2:55:13] <+Jonesman64> nothing can stop... THE CLOG
[2:55:16] <%MachoMadnesss94> SCP poop
[2:55:22] <cureneckbeard> sipsipElmo
[2:55:23] <%blankwaffle> theres more to this game than i thought
[2:55:32] <%Teintstein> there's some lore that talks about how you shouldn't drink the water because it has "chunks" in it
[2:55:33] <+Zereaux> cant wait for pat to get to the japan area
[2:55:38] <%MachoMadnesss94> @blankwaffle it’s good
[2:55:49] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Capta1n_H3nry I'm not entirely talking about pat's framerate, just what I've heard in general, but I've heard that the main sore spot on this game is the performance
[2:55:56] <ZE_Count> You dotn have to talk to him
[2:56:05] <TheAmazingClaytor> That's a demons
[2:56:05] <Teyaric> You got the ability points already, stumbo.
[2:56:09] <+gatoralus> i don't think he will have anything to say
[2:56:13] <+Jonesman64> those look friendly
[2:56:20] <+SirSamVimes> @Hunk_Of_Dunk performance is mainly an issue on the basic PS4 and Xbox One, it's fine on a decent PC or PS4 Pro
[2:56:23] <Djinnazz> @Hunk_Of_Dunk On PC, on PS4 it runs fine.
[2:56:35] <ZE_Count> You already finished mission pat dont have to go to Alti.
[2:56:53] <%king_wragles> It's cute how they still try
[2:56:53] <+SirSamVimes> I love Pierce, it's so satisfying
[2:56:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Estuko My dad can eat very few things the older he gets. It's gonna be a gamble whether I'm the same, or it was all the antibiotics his Doc prescribed as a teenager. Milk and tomatoes are already giving me gas FeelsBadMan
[2:57:00] <wigglestheninja> This game gives me the most quantum break vibes
[2:57:00] <Ner234> That gun is a delete button LUL
[2:57:14] <cureneckbeard> X
[2:57:23] <%Teintstein> nah
[2:57:26] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Continue towards Black Rock Processing"
[2:57:29] <+Estuko> @Sphincter_Spelunker I'm lactose intolerant FeelsBadMan I love milk and stuff but cramp bad, sick. The egg intolerance seems recent and it sucks
[2:57:29] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The Aptheosis of GUN
[2:57:32] <Teyaric> Untill endgame, when you realize it can never be upgraded, the poor Pierce
[2:57:33] <%blankwaffle> @MachoMadnesss94 yeah man, i thought it was gonna be like a bland less good psy ops
[2:57:36] <+SirSamVimes> This game has solid gunfeel imo
[2:57:37] <RantingRavager> Just watch his videos once in a while
[2:57:37] <zipfile777> quantum break DLC
[2:57:39] <Teyaric> shotgun becomes bae by the end tho
[2:57:42] <%MachoMadnesss94> Grip is good
[2:57:46] <+SirSamVimes> @Teyaric even without upgrades, it still held its own in endgame
[2:57:49] <%hawk_rush> shotgun is best girl at the endgame
[2:57:52] <%logoth_> AtiVidya
[2:57:58] <@commanderclaw> Check back each new main story mission
[2:58:02] <+peenlordsupreme> Pat are you going to check out Greedfall>
[2:58:03] <CrypticMochi> Is the pierce stronger than your punch?
[2:58:09] <Djinnazz> There's one mod that makes Grip the best in the game
[2:58:19] <Malziel> What happened to ass chain? LUL
[2:58:20] <TheMorilo> Guns are not really that important
[2:58:23] <+gatoralus> i used pierce most of the game but yeah shatter is big strong with upgrades
[2:58:26] <Teyaric> +5 projectiles, +25% damage, +75% Damage After Kill - total room cleaner
[2:58:30] <ZE_Count> Ability points pat!
[2:58:30] <+Alig200> Grip + Headshot Damage Mod + Damage Mod + Eternal Fire = OP.
[2:58:31] <%Teintstein> @Djinnazz :heart: that mod
[2:58:34] <%MachoMadnesss94> @djinnazz what mod is that?
[2:58:38] <Valdorick> He's still playing Astral Chain, its on monday
[2:58:43] <+SirSamVimes> @Alig200 of course it's OP with a secret cheat mod
[2:58:45] <Malziel> Ah, got'cha! thanks
[2:58:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Ass chain is on hold. Gotta hold them asses
[2:58:56] <Djinnazz> @MachoMadnesss94 Not gonna spoil it but it's a secret sie mission.
[2:58:57] <mayorrev> uh oh

[2:59:02] <+Estuko> LUL
[2:59:02] <%Agami23> i feel like the third person shooter elements of this game are odd

[2:59:32] <%starotter70> @Valdorick And Wednesday, and Friday
[2:59:37] <+SirSamVimes> Y'know something I love about the combat in this game? Despite being a TPS, there's no cover system like 90% of TPS games have
[2:59:44] <%worldbrand> Just kidding!
[2:59:45] <Torruun> So what's the story of this game?
[2:59:56] <%grayjammer> Spin with Accuracy+, Velocity+ and Cost- tears shit up
[2:59:57] <%MachoMadnesss94> Take that cardboard box you hiss scum
[3:00:06] <astrophizz> they die at end of timer
[3:00:06] <mayorrev> F

[3:00:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Torruun In a facility full of SCPs there's a noise that is taking over peoples' minds and also mutating them.
[3:00:32] <+SirSamVimes> @Torruun we came to find our brother who was kidnapped when we were children, but for some reason we're the new boss here
[3:00:34] <Valdorick> @starotter70 hot damn!

[3:03:36] <chronoxgp> global illumination
[3:03:40] <%Laecerelius> Oh man I frogot about the Secret Room

[3:03:47] <%bevyrage> hell yeah it's so good
[3:03:49] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Place of power like the oldest house
[3:03:51] <%spacehouse> The motel embodies the concept of all 'motels
[3:03:56] <%bevyrage> and is what i feel this hotel is based off of
[3:03:57] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh god the water cooler
[3:04:04] <Graxe_> It might even work opposite to the Oldest House, where you can only find it if you don't look for it.

[3:16:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @uselesswhitenoise I pointed out in a donation that bith games have nearly identical Astral Planes
[3:16:36] <Soul_Intern> @Mekhet09 WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THOSE THINGS
[3:16:36] <%MachoMadnesss94> @mekhet09 Elmo is immortal
[3:16:37] <%Agami23> probably something not good
[3:16:40] <Crankthulhu> @Mekhet09 What if Pat dies first in a redbull induced superstroke?

[3:22:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat This isn't even the scariest thing he has delt with this month
[3:22:30] <%Torruun> This dude has already accepted the fact that he's dead as fuck.
[3:22:30] <JDebss> his head is like twice the size of yours
[3:22:32] <Mister_McDerp> dude looks kinda odd
[3:22:34] <%starotter70> Hey, at least he's not working retail
[3:22:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This is Robbie Rotten from Lazy Town

[3:22:50] <SomeAsianDood> I mean he's D-class right? He's good as dead Kappa
[3:22:50] <Jontman42> His face doesn't seem comfortable on his skull
[3:22:51] <mayorrev> :(
[3:22:53] <FlyguyJP> Low Self Esteem :(
[3:22:54] <Soul_Intern> :(
[3:22:54] <cureneckbeard> Pat would you rather work at this facility, or retail
[3:22:59] <%grayjammer> :(
[3:22:59] <+Grizzytron> someone got it right - at least he's not working at the grocery store
[3:23:02] <Jontman42> Oh no she's got bitch in her heart
[3:23:13] <Soul_Intern> I like this guy
[3:23:18] <Soul_Intern> He deserves a raise
[3:23:22] <Soul_Intern> Or get laid
[3:23:24] <Soul_Intern> Or both
[3:23:28] <%AllyBeeBoo> Why are there floating bodies everywhere? Are they dead? Everyone is just ignoring them!
[3:23:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jontman42 Her youthful soul is full of bitch
[3:23:33] <FlyguyJP> 0500 Zulu? What does the Zulu mean?
[3:23:33] <Valdorick> Oh god, think of the poor fuckers working in the Place of Power that takes the form of a normal grocery store.
[3:23:35] <%joylent_blue> a youthful soul, and yet it is brimming with bitch
[3:23:36] <%floralkami> Understand that most of the actors are modeled after real people.
[3:23:38] <Veetory> I wonder what David Cage would think of this game
[3:23:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AllyBeeBoo basically dead
[3:23:40] <%Puhff> Huh. Her irises are really similar to that Entity that's helping her...
[3:23:47] <mayorrev> FREE SHOT? PogChamp
[3:23:48] <$Zairthos> i think retail actually helped me have a more positive outlook on life
[3:23:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @FlyguyJP Z
[3:23:49] <ScreamLord> Look at that Fallout 4 Assault Rifle that dude has!
[3:23:49] <%grayjammer> @FlyguyJP Z
[3:23:51] <%tragicjohnson84> Floating bodies are part of the facility aesthetic
[3:23:52] <FlyguyJP> David Cage wishes he could make a coherent story as this
[3:24:00] <+Surf_Zombie> LUL
[3:24:01] <Rayorin> Those guys are swinging those LMG's around like they are made of paper
[3:24:02] <ZE_Count> Check to see if arish got new stuff to talk about I cant remember if he does.
[3:24:06] <42nfl19> Wait is this recording in the past or present? They call it HISS? @AngriestPat
[3:24:07] <FlyguyJP> I know it's Z but he said 0500 Zulu. So 5 AM but what does the Z mean
[3:24:07] <Ner234> D E S I R E
[3:24:10] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @allybeeboo Apparently they’ve been corrupted by the Hiss, but they’re not hostile.
[3:24:10] <%tragicjohnson84> David Cage couldn't understand this story
[3:24:11] <%blankwaffle> i wish real life had just audio tapes laying around everywhere
[3:24:12] <%MachoMadnesss94> @allybeeboo nonviolent hiss infected people
[3:24:16] <Djinnazz> SIKE
[3:24:17] <%Teintstein> This game's aesthetic is like The Bureau combined with Mandy.
[3:24:32] <%tragicjohnson84> The game has 'Inside' feels to me
[3:24:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> In SCP that guard would be terminated
[3:24:41] <%floralkami> @Rayorin you can't swing a 30 pound stick like it's paper??
[3:24:42] <FlyguyJP> I mean anything is possible in this place
[3:24:45] <+SirSamVimes> To be fair, in this place, a mermaid is perfectly possible
[3:24:48] <RantingRavager> Paige is a mermaid PogChamp
[3:24:50] <T3merity> he bought it, now i can have the mermaid all to myself
[3:24:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Which kind? Regular mermaid, reverse, or double?
[3:24:56] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat was that recording in the past? They called it a HISS.
[3:24:57] <TheMorilo> I love how everyone is super chill with all of this bullshit going on in the Oldest House
[3:25:00] <Valdorick> Real life does has audio tapes everywhere, its just a crime to break into houses and listen to them Kappa
[3:25:01] <haveswordmuststing> is it a reverse mermaid at least
[3:25:03] <Rayorin> @floralkami not usually
[3:25:05] <TheAmazingClaytor> CorpseS*
[3:25:06] <transporterthesequel> the HALLWAY

[3:26:15] <%MonsieurHedge> please dont throw d class at the swan boat
[3:26:16] <shevan123> ayy
[3:26:21] <+squirtkitten> I'm convinced the devs wanted to make an SCP game

[3:26:39] <+CourageTheCat> YEET BOAT
[3:26:39] <$i_am_therydon> this is the kinda place where pranking your coworker by moving his coffee cup over 2 inches can really screw with people.

[3:26:43] <haveswordmuststing> @squirtkitten which is weird since its creative commons, right

[3:39:36] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat doesnt have to be Central Executive, it can be any control point
[3:39:38] <%MachoMadnesss94> No just any control point
[3:39:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you just need to get to any checkpoint

[3:40:03] <Soul_Intern> YEAH YEAH
[3:40:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Everyone should sub
[3:40:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Naruto gets two spin offs and Bleach gets it's only spin off canned FeelsBadMan
[3:40:06] <%grayjammer> bnyeear
[3:40:08] <viridianowl> English is hard
[3:40:09] <%Deekman> then buy a $5 footlong
[3:40:10] <Valdorick> But does Pat get the money from a 5 dollar sub, or is his money half off too?
[3:40:12] <%MachoMadnesss94> Loading door LuL
[3:40:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> those sure werent words
[3:40:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> So I should steal my own credit card and buy subs with it?
[3:40:28] <%crimsonharvest> did you see the comment on that mission
[3:40:29] <%crimsonharvest> lol
[3:40:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Rated M for mature
[3:40:38] <FlyguyJP> Yay more Friends!
[3:40:39] <SpellCatty> M for Mature, nice
[3:40:40] <%Deekman> Fuck it I'll go sub to Paige for a month to, she's cool
[3:40:43] <+rosa_buttsemburg> why is he not upgrading launch
[3:40:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This game is severely lacking in top tier next gen butt graphica
[3:40:50] <%floralkami> @Sphincter_Spelunker what's the other spin off?
[3:41:00] <FlyguyJP> Big Loadig
[3:41:02] <%MachoMadnesss94> Loading door
[3:41:02] <b_ikki> i cant believe that just opens
[3:41:03] <moore595> lol
[3:41:06] <%Nope80808> Note that its only for tier one some you wont get the special tier 3 reward of feet pics from pat.
[3:41:07] <+SirSamVimes> @rosa_buttsemburg because he wants to upgrade seize
[3:41:12] <haveswordmuststing> @Valdorick sponsored by Subway, so it must be less than half Kappa
[3:41:18] <b_ikki> i backed down from literally every red light door
[3:41:22] <FlyguyJP> How convenient
[3:41:22] <%filialpails> but I'd rather stay and play :c
[3:41:24] <Valdorick> Goddamn
[3:41:27] <@commanderclaw> I like to stay and play
[3:41:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @floralkami Fucking LOL. That's the truth ain't it? Burn the Witch was a one shot that wasn't popular
[3:41:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Though Chainsawman seems to have taken the turn Burn would have gone
[3:41:57] <haveswordmuststing> i say this because those 6 inch subs are almost never 6 inch
[3:42:16] <%Calek> read the title of the document!
[3:42:17] <SpellCatty> I think they have rulers now
[3:42:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @haveswordmuststing they are 4.5 inches
[3:42:22] <%Kiiper> Kiiper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:42:24] <TastySammiches> subway is a shitty company that makes shitty sandwiches but I gotta admit it's a good pun
[3:42:27] <%Calek> SARCOPHAGUS CONTAINER
[3:42:28] <FlyguyJP> The [REDACTED]'s energy? Sounds 100% safe
[3:42:33] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat don't forget to look at the monitors
[3:42:35] <transporterthesequel> Something SARCOPHAGUS!?
[3:42:39] <FlyguyJP> Base literally runs on Hell energy doesn't it
[3:42:41] <%floralkami> @Sphincter_Spelunker i..... Deadass.... Do not know what burn the witch is in context of Naruto 4Head FeelsBadMan
[3:42:43] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat look above the monitors
[3:42:46] <Graxe_> You should be able to guess what the N is, probably
[3:42:47] <Soul_Intern> @Calek Able time
[3:42:47] <%dekkitout> Drink the Juice of Power
[3:42:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Dark Sarcophagus
[3:42:52] <scrumbotime> It runs on Northmoor Power
[3:42:55] <ZE_Count> Hey Pat check out the monitors on the reactor here.
[3:43:01] <%crimsonharvest> caged a stand?
[3:43:02] <%floralkami> I need to read chainsaw man, tho
[3:43:06] <+SirSamVimes> Previous director, now a living battery
[3:43:07] <%Aeoneth> Holy SHIT
[3:43:09] <%MachoMadnesss94> It’s occupant?
[3:43:10] <%hawk_rush> siphon that northmoor energy lmao
[3:43:10] <%grayjammer> Oh dear.
[3:43:11] <FlyguyJP> That looks fine in there
[3:43:11] <Soul_Intern> FUCKING 075
[3:43:11] <Djinnazz> That's a dude
[3:43:12] <%Aeoneth> THat's a LORE bomb
[3:43:13] <Mister_McDerp> I love the word sarcophagus
[3:43:14] <+Grizzytron> oh my god I never read that my first time through
[3:43:15] <Tucker0603> NORTHMOOR
[3:43:16] <Valdorick> Its a guy screaming
[3:43:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Northmoor will serve after he dies!
[3:43:18] <asddsa28> yup he in there
[3:43:20] <+Alig200> remember when Trench said that "a director's job is to keep the lights on"
[3:43:21] <%crimsonharvest> he gained too much power
[3:43:24] <%starotter70> well then
[3:43:25] <+BillyWimblett> thats cool af
[3:43:26] <transporterthesequel> For...for SOME reason
[3:43:27] <%Teintstein> yupppp
[3:43:27] <%Calek> the former former director
[3:43:30] <%MachoMadnesss94> WTF
[3:43:31] <%Aeoneth> I didn't even fucking make that connection in my playthrough
[3:43:31] <%Deekman> the fate of all directors
[3:43:35] <viridianowl> Because science
[3:43:35] <FlyguyJP> I guess the former Director got Fired Hard
[3:43:36] <Valdorick> Biobatteries are pretty dope #JustStellarisThings
[3:43:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We are all batteries for our masters
[3:43:37] <ZE_Count> He keeps the lights on.
[3:43:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Gotta keep the lights on
[3:43:43] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat rewatch the noorthmore hotline
[3:43:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Northmore wanted more and more power...he got what he wanted
[3:43:47] <%Rumbutt> He linked the first flame
[3:43:51] <Graxe_> Northmoor wanted more and more power, but he couldn't control it and Trench turned him into a reactor to contain him.
[3:43:52] <FutaSnek> THAT SEEMS PROFOUNDLY SHITTY
[3:43:52] <%Mekhet09> Use more.
[3:43:55] <transporterthesequel> You are WELL on your way to becoming a goddamn battery
[3:43:56] <%starotter70> Better than paying the rent
[3:43:59] <RupanSen> he's a Lord of Cinder basically
[3:44:03] <Djinnazz> Raw deal that one is.
[3:44:08] <%tragicjohnson84> I'm really scared of the dark
[3:44:08] <%Teintstein> "it's a living"
[3:44:12] <+SirSamVimes> A lot of the worldbuilding shit in this game is profoundly shitty
[3:44:15] <FlyguyJP> So... must get pretty boring being a literal battery for all eternity
[3:44:15] <cureneckbeard> TETSUOOOO
[3:44:15] <%Puhff> Which Director? Trench? Or his predecessor?
[3:44:22] <%Aeoneth> his predecessor
[3:44:22] <%aeravon> Director Mum runs on batt-ries?
[3:44:24] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Some people want to become the embodiment of fire and some people just wanna be a sentient toilet
[3:44:25] <+forlorncarton> not exactly the best of retirement plans
[3:44:26] <%Teintstein> @Puhff trench's predecessor
[3:44:26] <%floralkami> @SirSamVimes how so?
[3:44:32] <FlyguyJP> @Puhff The paper said Trench built it as soon as he became director
[3:44:34] <FutaSnek> LUL He's smoking
[3:44:36] <Graxe_> Vergil Sarcophagus Container
[3:44:38] <Valdorick> He can't even beat it; it burned off.
[3:44:41] <jestrfestr> feel the PAYNE
[3:44:42] <%jessedouglas> Payne to the max!
[3:44:42] <%floralkami> @Puhff the first Director
[3:44:45] <FutaSnek> Is that some cheeky forshawdowing?
[3:44:47] <%tragicjohnson84> Maximum Power!
[3:44:49] <%walternatorz> ha! puns!
[3:44:50] <viridianowl> @Djinnazz Raw deal yes, but he's well done.
[3:44:52] <Djinnazz> Well, he got what he wanted.
[3:44:54] <+Alig200> hes still all about power tbh
[3:44:54] <+Estuko> I automatically assumed he was gonna say "COMMANDER" from XCOM2, I wasl ike "oh fuck what is it this time."
[3:44:55] <+SirSamVimes> @floralkami just the way that everything seems on the verge of collapse in some horrible way
[3:44:55] <Tucker0603> he had to link the first flame
[3:44:58] <rubbishbinge> Director Volgin used too much lightning powers is now on fire
[3:44:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway500 bonus50 Our facility is 100% green, relying entirely on revolutionary man-on-fire-forever technology.
[3:45:04] <Djinnazz> @viridianowl Well played.
[3:45:07] <+Grizzytron> the trench bits are the schlockiest shit and I'm here for it
[3:45:10] <FlyguyJP> He went alone with becoming a battery
[3:45:12] <FlyguyJP> *along
[3:45:15] <TastySammiches> haHAA
[3:45:16] <+SirSamVimes> @floralkami also the FBC is pretty amoral, I mean the reason you come here in the first place is because they kidnapped your brother
[3:45:19] <shinxling> hey pat, just wanted to know who was your waifu in P5?
[3:45:19] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:45:20] <Valdorick> Volgin was a Oops
[3:45:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> literally keeping the lights on
[3:45:22] <maybefalco> i absolutely love james mccaffery's voice
[3:45:22] <JayEarly> so he’s just burning forever? that’s metal
[3:45:28] <Grennold> IT'S PAYNE! GET HIM!
[3:45:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Damn dog
[3:45:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> good job, Gwyn
[3:45:35] <%Aeoneth> Fuuuuuck.... I didn't take that to mean LITERALLY
[3:45:37] <%IronGlorfindel> That's Fucked
[3:45:40] <%starotter70> When he pushes his glasses up, I think of an anime character
[3:45:41] <ZE_Count> A file over the fans here.
[3:45:44] <%alexandrecau> B.B bam bam
[3:45:49] <RantingRavager> He needed MORE POWER
[3:46:03] <+CourageTheCat> keeping the lights on lmao
[3:46:04] <FlyguyJP> Personally I'd take the Bullet to the Head Retirement Package to being a Battery forever
[3:46:06] <+spoopy24> northmore reminds me of the ilusive man
[3:46:07] <FlyguyJP> OH GOD FAN DEATH
[3:46:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I sleep with the fan on monkaS
[3:46:11] <+Estuko> WHAT
[3:46:14] <@lewdskeletor13> KOREA
[3:46:15] <+ArcLifth> Jesus christ
[3:46:15] <Valdorick> Jesus Christ LUL
[3:46:16] <Daxalog> Hmmm
[3:46:18] <+SirSamVimes> They accidentally created the fan death conspiracy theory LUL
[3:46:18] <Marpolo13> WTF
[3:46:19] <PunishedMercer_> instructions unclear, killed by a fan.
[3:46:20] <ZE_Count> Fan Death is the dumbest.
[3:46:21] <JayEarly> he’s just doing the Max Payne voice and I don’t care because it fucking rules
[3:46:22] <ScreamLord> Korea is weird
[3:46:23] <%InugamiTheHound> korean fan death LOL
[3:46:23] <%starotter70> Uhhhhh
[3:46:26] <%Spydurman> hahahaha
[3:46:36] <%floralkami> @SirSamVimes cause it technically is in the grand scheme. And world/universal threats revolving powerful humans usually necessitate such amorality.....
[3:46:36] <Oxybe> G'day!
[3:46:37] <Graxe_> Northmoor's still alive in the reactor, I think, but the coolant keeps him immobile.
[3:46:38] <scrumbotime> .... they goofed up and made people think fans can kill you
[3:46:38] <FutaSnek> Hopefully he's not conscious while being used a FUCKING SPARK PLUG
[3:46:38] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> 1954
[3:46:41] <Marpolo13> this fan is SO POWERFUL it actually sucks the air Keepo
[3:46:46] <%filialpails> you can't breath air if it's all cut up, everyone knows that
[3:46:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Koreans don't understand how molecules work
[3:46:47] <FlyguyJP> Fan Death is the worst thing ever
[3:46:47] <%sprigg> sprigg subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:46:47] <%Ixiah> @AngriestPat will you stream the nintendo direct tomorow ? maybe u will be wrong about metroid again Kappa
[3:46:52] <%ElenaManetta> watch out for the OOPS
[3:46:55] <b_ikki> justice for fans
[3:46:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> TOLD YOU IT'S REAL
[3:46:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I'm a "fan" of this death
[3:46:59] <%NeroInfinite> LUL fan death
[3:47:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Fan Lives Matter
[3:47:12] <%NeroInfinite> IT'S THE LEAST REAL IT IS
[3:47:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> more waifus for pokemon?
[3:47:21] <Valdorick> Wait, so does that mean an oops that is in question is called a Potential Object of Power?
[3:47:22] <FlyguyJP> Doesn't this universe rely on the perception effect? Like if enough people believe a myth is real it becomes real?
[3:47:24] <%starotter70> I pray there is SMT 5, but I don't expect it
[3:47:24] <%SirGO0SE> spoderman in smash
[3:47:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> More Husbandos for Pokemon
[3:47:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> THE GAME SAY IT'S REAL
[3:47:36] <FutaSnek> When I heard fan death I imagined some metal shit like a partial decapitation or something
[3:47:37] <%Ixiah> terry bogard in smash
[3:47:38] <lyzegredjag> FE DLC gimme
[3:47:43] <@lewdskeletor13> Are you gonna be awake for the Direct
[3:47:44] <+TheRaiGuy33> so is this game like some Warehouse 13 mumbo jumbo?
[3:47:44] <%dekkitout> I hope, though most likely nothing that'll beat Cynthia SeriousSloth @Sphincter_Spelunker
[3:47:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> more Furries for Pokemon
[3:47:50] <+scrublordmyo> i've been loving the shit out of this game
[3:47:54] <Oxybe> man, today started shitty and tonight is going faaaaanrastic. free wings+beer at the pub and patstream. show me anything better!
[3:48:03] <shinxling> @starotter70 ya gotta believe
[3:48:07] <b_ikki> free wings atpGasm
[3:48:09] <%InugamiTheHound> @Breakfast_Megapowers aren't all pokemons furries?
[3:48:09] <Valdorick> Nice shot
[3:48:10] <Rayorin> old fashioned as in jumping down the elevator shaft?
[3:48:12] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Did you see that Rajang is coming back as Iceborne's first free DLC monster?
[3:48:13] <Soul_Intern> nice one PAt
[3:48:13] <Graxe_> Yeah, if there's enough of a belief in something for long enough, an object might gain supernatural power.
[3:48:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @starotter70 SMT5 was already teased. Unless you mean something substantial
[3:48:15] <Djinnazz> Nailed it.
[3:48:16] <%floralkami> @FlyguyJP the effect may become real, or it may use the same standards, but to a different affect
[3:48:16] <%Ixiah> @Oxybe tittis
[3:48:16] <%grayjammer> Smooth Moves
[3:48:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> u did it
[3:48:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @InugamiTheHound Not Magnemite and similar non furry ones
[3:48:38] <%starotter70> @Sphincter_Spelunker Ye, like another trailer or something
[3:48:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @dekkitout Dude. It took the internet less than 30 mins for r34 of Nessa and Marnie
[3:48:44] <Oxybe> hmm... your thesis brings up a valid point. we must look deeper.
[3:48:48] <%Zalthia> Will we get to meet Northmoore in game?
[3:48:51] <%floralkami> @FlyguyJP i.e. the room test
[3:49:04] <JayEarly> so is Kojima just an easter egg or an actual character ?
[3:49:07] <%InugamiTheHound> @Breakfast_Megapowers okay tons of furries and rule 34 of them. Enjoy
[3:49:19] <%dekkitout> I remain firm as a Cynthia stan SeriousSloth
[3:49:19] <+scrublordmyo> chicken wire - 1, magic gun - 0
[3:49:24] <Graxe_> How OOPs and AIs are made just reminds me of how primals are summoned in FF14.
[3:49:25] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @jayearly It's a PS4 exclusive mission
