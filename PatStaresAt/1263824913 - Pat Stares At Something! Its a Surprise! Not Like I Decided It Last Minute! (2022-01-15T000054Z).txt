[0:18:25] <%maenos2> guys i doubt this pat guy's credentials as a doctor
[0:18:26] <%pokefan9956> it still sucks ass
[0:18:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's weaker but spreads like crazy
[0:18:30] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> weaker at the damage in your lungs but way more virulent yeah
[0:18:30] <+emperri> what about the Omikron variant
[0:18:31] <Dova573> I gotta serve people coffee who dont even wear masks at work
[0:18:31] <Necnill> Than Delta. Which was not mild. It's not mild.
[0:18:32] <Profmcstevie> So is a BB gun, shoot yourself with one
[0:18:33] <%AncelDeLambert> "contagious"
[0:18:33] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:18:34] <+Mechanized82> the prior strains are still out there
[0:18:35] <%sporeian94> But everyone there is vaccinated?
[0:18:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I caught the regular old flu. it sucks. they make me go to work, which is retarded, since i tested negative for covid
[0:18:36] <SilverFaustX> yea statistically
[0:18:36] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat A friend worked at a hotel for a while, and the worst thing... all the room air vents are tied together... without filters.
[0:18:36] <%cartakus> But spread like hell
[0:18:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> what Pat said
[0:18:38] <oniwahoo> Opinion did a lot of damage to Pat though
[0:18:38] <%averyoddjew> but it will still stop people from getting things if needed
[0:18:38] <leinadtonu> Dr. Pat = Best Pat.
[0:18:40] <%bravebravesrobin> THANK YOU
[0:18:41] <%cgreene64> I personally would like to not get Covid at all tbh
[0:18:42] <+Orcapugs> Good old dr Pat
[0:18:47] <Jetsfantasy> Just recovering from Omicron, it fucking SUCKED despite being vaccinated and being in good health. You're not immune to being "THAT ONE"
[0:18:49] <%oda_flobunaga> And way more infectious, sooo more ppl get bad cases
[0:18:49] <%luftraumm1> carnaval foi cancelado po
[0:18:49] <%AncelDeLambert> "virulent" is how nasty it is. contagious is how fast it spread
[0:18:50] <foomaster22> Less damage but more DPS
[0:18:53] <%StaceMcGate> Hello I just got here, tell me the surprise!
[0:18:57] <%tank7013> If you walk into a crowd while carrying Omicron you are firing a peanut gun in random directions
[0:18:58] <%JoshManVGH> Also LONG COVID IS STILL A THING! And it's terrible!
[0:18:58] <+FingaLights> I played Plague Inc enough to know this
[0:18:59] <jellssssss20> Yeah I a-little understand if you’re being paid to go, if you’re paying to go get sick and die?? You win the Darwin award
[0:19:03] <+SpiritRoads> is it true that people who get Omikron are sent a copy of the game personally from David Cage?
[0:19:03] <%TigerCatGo> Mild BUT still sucks to get and spread. Lots of people's also have different underlining conditions :(
[0:19:03] <%moon_king> I have it right now it sucks man
[0:19:04] <%octotasty> hipothetically
[0:19:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> But Pat, if I ignore it it doesn't exist so it's fine
[0:19:15] <+emperri> I got that wide COVID
[0:19:17] <%bravebravesrobin> Virulence can be much worse, especially when you need ICU beds for so many cases
[0:19:18] <Louie_Salmon> Also, surviving covid is not a good thing! Having it at all can lead to lifelong conditions that we still don't understand!
[0:19:18] <%Nekros4442> remember people exist that there are people that have shit for immune systems
[0:19:18] <deviljhojho_> let's say, hypothetically
[0:19:18] <%cartakus> oof
[0:19:19] <%chill_o_wisp> other way
[0:19:23] <DanThePumpkinman> fun fact: apparently the US gov has decided that hospitals no longer need to report daily coivd numbers. they have completely given up
[0:19:24] <%RealThiele> i was told there would be no math
[0:19:25] <jellssssss20> Long covid doesn’t change
[0:19:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> :O
[0:19:28] <deviljhojho_> quick maffs
[0:19:32] <%Shonen_hero> As someone who probably has the Omicron strain, it's 'weaker' but I still lost my taste and smell. It's not great
[0:19:36] <IvanMistwalker> big oof
[0:19:36] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'd love to go back to a con, but it just doesn't seem sensible with COVID still around.

[0:19:59] <+Orcapugs> Math with Dr Pat
[0:19:59] <+FingaLights> Fuck Omikron
[0:20:00] <%TigerCatGo> Agreed BibleThump
[0:20:00] <%RealThiele> but i dont live in a society pat LUL
[0:20:00] <KenzBurp> are people really in here trying to downplay this shit?
[0:20:00] <%waltzqueen> Can't you still premanantly loose taste and smell? That doesn't sound weaker
[0:20:02] <%bravebravesrobin> FACTS
[0:20:05] <deviljhojho_> wouldnt want to get apendicitis right now
[0:20:05] <%EsotericOdyssey> I got a filling at the dentist today
[0:20:07] <Yrefe> I can't believe we live in a society...
[0:20:07] <%Vextalyst> THANK YOU PAT
[0:20:07] <chimeraxmachina> But Pat what if we just stop reporting how many people die from COVID, won’t that just solve the issue? (I’m so sorry to all my US people, hang in there)
[0:20:07] <zzNamttamzz> In general don't fuck diseases
[0:20:08] <Shlorpaderp> omicron is just a marvel villain name
[0:20:09] <%averyoddjew> and this is why you're one of my favorite streamers
[0:20:11] <Jetsfantasy> It's fucking wild when Pat is right
[0:20:11] <%JoshManVGH> It means you may not get hospaitalized as quickly. Also for a mild disease, hospitals are getting FUCKED
[0:20:13] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't wait for Omicron to do the fusion dance with the next variant Mephistopheles, and user in the next dark age, gonna be lit
[0:20:14] <+rafaelba93> i love you pat
[0:20:15] <%Vextalyst> Like FFS
[0:20:15] <%TerpanderLux> no :)
[0:20:17] <deafmutelaughing> what if they make the cum over room into a hospital room
[0:20:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Urgent Care centers around the US have multiple day wait times rn
[0:20:21] <Profmcstevie> Stop killing your medical professionals, you can't live without those >:(
[0:20:23] <%oda_flobunaga> Word
[0:20:24] <%bravebravesrobin> I HATED STATISTICS
[0:20:24] <%doomunderthestairs> Whenever I see the title of the steam say "Surprise or Mystery" I always hope its just a PPP Trashcast
[0:20:24] <ZawaAmaz> it still can put you in the hospital, not dying isn't a good bar to set for yourself
[0:20:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> What he said
[0:20:25] <$StrawberryPantsu> Frog Fractions?
[0:20:26] <%cartakus> I IGNORED IT
[0:20:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> I did but fuck statistics
[0:20:27] <%TigerCatGo> Don't spread the David Cage Omikron!! Stay Safe!!
[0:20:27] <%baka_sugoi> numbers are hard
[0:20:27] <arkv01> math, wut? i can only count up to 100 sir
[0:20:28] <%za7az> Well I failed that course, so take that Kappa
[0:20:28] <leinadtonu> Patrick, why are you trying to be reasonable on the internet?
[0:20:30] <+Ches_Neckbeard> I had to take stats and research methods goddamnit. stop making me think about it!
[0:20:30] <%JoshManVGH> I did not.... they made me take trig
[0:20:31] <deviljhojho_> look i didnt get a business degree to learn math
[0:20:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> if you can litter than I can ignore a global pandemic it's totally the same
[0:20:31] <+emperri> COVID is like frog fractions
[0:20:31] <+cvp5127> no im vaccinated so im invincible
[0:20:31] <%coward_man> not in the England we didn't
[0:20:32] <%Valdorick> Statistics use to be part of highschool...
[0:20:32] <Shlorpaderp> Frog Fractions
[0:20:32] <iswearimjustdandy> My mantra: Just because I might be okay, the person I could give it to might not. This mantra doesnt work if you have no empathy obviously
[0:20:32] <%blistexthief> Oh no, I made ze bad variant
[0:20:33] <auraoftheearth009> Fuck stats, but it helps understand the situation
[0:20:33] <Louie_Salmon> Higher education costs lots of money here, like healthcare
[0:20:34] <%MegadBlitz> it's exponential
[0:20:36] <+FingaLights> Yeah, USA education is fucked
[0:20:37] <%Shonen_hero> God, I was browsing the HermanCainAward reddit and listening to some nurse/doctor testimonials, and it's super fucking depressing. Lots of people are losing out on beds for the unvaccinated
[0:20:37] <jellssssss20> Anyone going to a hospital IS contributing to the doctors and nurses killing themselves
[0:20:37] <+Psycho_Kowalski> I drank bleach and injected sunlight into my blood, I'll be fine.
[0:20:39] <%octotasty> I had, statistics are the most boring, yet most useful branch of Mathematics
[0:20:40] <%RealThiele> its me somethin
[0:20:41] <oniwahoo> @chimeraxmachina Omikron only exists when it's being observed, we all know this lol
[0:20:41] <vile_brand> pat we went to public school. higher education doesnt exist
[0:20:41] <deviljhojho_> freak
[0:20:43] <%TerpanderLux> no
[0:20:43] <%kysath> Makes me wonder if covid is gonna be a "around forever" virus or one of those that eventually goes extinct via vaccines or natural reasons
[0:20:44] <IvanMistwalker> Save me Pat from this American hell hole.
[0:20:44] <marvel877> Get your booster, wear your mask, stay 6 ft from people.
[0:20:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> we're going back to the 1400s and just expecting a plague to kill off a portion of the population in the village
[0:20:45] <goshdangjoe> why would i take statistics when i can just listen to the redheaded manbaby explain it to me
[0:20:45] <Shlorpaderp> No

[0:34:02] <Jaysky> Celeste's DLC is harder than this
[0:34:03] <%StarOtter70> I don't think I ever beat the last world 🤔
[0:34:04] <tigerfang86> very prescient move pat
[0:34:04] <%averyoddjew> but you must
[0:34:07] <+ChillaxingJay> BloodTrail
[0:34:09] <jack5ter98> @Jaysky the XBLA version was
[0:34:13] <ghostpopelive> super meat boy speed runs make me sweat
[0:34:15] <%CalderGaming> @Jaysky yeah 1 year earlier
[0:34:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bother pat
[0:34:19] <PizzicatoFive5> use the wall to the right
[0:34:21] <ghostpopelive> like just watching them
[0:34:30] <%baka_sugoi> BloodTrail
[0:34:30] <Profmcstevie> No wonder this music slaps....Crypt Of The Necrodancer composer
[0:34:31] <%IronOhki> @sonofthedeepsouth Bother bother bother!
[0:34:38] <deafmutelaughing> I definitely remember looking up a few of these
[0:34:47] <+ChillaxingJay> catJAM
[0:34:48] <deviljhojho_> i almost understood that
[0:34:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> He must be bothered
[0:34:56] <Ipsenscastle> I could never do meatboy, it feels similarly slippery to mario which i could never do either
[0:34:56] <%IronOhki> @Profmcstevie I have been playing SO MUCH crypt since the new year. God that game kicks ass.
[0:35:02] <Jaysky> Ok yeah it seemed like they were launched around the same time. I prefered Meat Boy but Splosion had a quality to it
[0:35:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Sucks doesnt
[0:35:07] <%trekkie11041> is this a goblin resurgence?
[0:35:15] <Jaysky> I recall Shadow Complex as well
[0:35:24] <Frostydough1> fun fact you need time stop @PatStaresAt LUL
[0:35:34] <Ipsenscastle> @Jaysky i enjoyed splosion man a lot, it had a good gravity to it
[0:35:35] <Profmcstevie> But I want it *die* but I WANT IT * die*
[0:35:38] <Sunstalker> Bit sad you didn't risk a pathfinder stream when you were still indecisive right before. D:
[0:35:41] <%CalderGaming> the bandaids DO unlock stuff of substance, unlike strawberries
[0:35:56] <%StarOtter70> Eyyy
[0:35:57] <%IronOhki> You. Did it.
[0:36:01] <%akaprocul> LETS FUCKING GO PAT

[0:36:17] <%IronOhki> @CalderGaming Fuck those strawberries.
[0:36:30] <Profmcstevie> I will give Meat Boy this, I love it's replay of your deaths all at once
[0:36:51] <Profmcstevie> Watching 20 meat boys jump into the same fucking saw is comedy
[0:36:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so which is harder? this or cave story?
[0:36:58] <+ChillaxingJay> psaDab
[0:37:02] <Louie_Salmon> Celeste strawberries are mario coins
[0:37:03] <Jaysky> This
[0:37:05] <tigerfang86> BLOBS
[0:37:09] <Jaysky> Cave Story is nothing to this
[0:37:14] <Jaysky> In terms of difficulty
[0:37:23] <%IronOhki> This... until maybe the last sequence.
[0:37:26] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I'm back amd ready get my gross eyeball back!
[0:37:28] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I like how the meat juice tells you where you got to
[0:37:32] <%oda_flobunaga> Maybe some I Want to be the Game too?
[0:37:39] <%IronOhki> I never beat the hell sequence in Cave Story.
[0:37:56] <Profmcstevie> That entire secret path in Cave Story is the only precision platforming, this whole game is precision platforming

[0:38:26] <%TimetodiveLTX> it seems like a really hard game just to setup for streaming
[0:38:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> That game is great
[0:38:30] <Jaysky> @TurtlesAndTentacles Because you get satisfaction of defeating something tightly designed
[0:38:30] <+Mechanized82> Quentin Tarantino!?
[0:38:30] <%Vextalyst> No one is going to get that joke lol
[0:38:30] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Its a comedy platformer
[0:38:31] <Jetsfantasy> There was an amogus
[0:38:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> dem gams
[0:38:37] <%IronOhki> I do love how Cave Story had several opportunities to just say "fuck this I'm out." The very second you meet a flying dragon, you can just nope out and leave everyone else to die, and it counts as "an ending." Then ever better ending gets harder and harder.
[0:38:41] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh my god. I haven't heard of iwbtg in fuckin years
[0:38:42] <%tusk102> Super meatboy on my 21st birthday? Thats a rad gift

[0:39:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Hold jump button
[0:39:22] <%GabeSweetMan> I Wanna Be the Guy is Nintendo hard in that it wants specific inputs from you. Once you have the muscle memory down, it's the same every single time. The real fun is how funny the deaths are the first time when you're not expecting them.
[0:39:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just do it perfectly Kappa

[0:53:59] <Treasure_Vault> If you ever feel like going back to inscryption, a completed save game with chapter select would let you restart act 3. If you feel truly fucked, might be worth finding one.

[0:54:03] <Jaysky> @PocketBearIllustrator Never got to play either of those but my first game was this scope/gun game that didn't work and then Sonic 2, which caused me to love Sonic until like... Sonic Heroes.

[1:08:35] <Jaysky> This game is called brb screen
[1:08:36] <Profmcstevie> This is Patrick pattyMods
[1:08:42] <Paltheos> @Trace_Bovier 2d platformer. Super Meat Boy's one of the best there ever was
[1:08:50] <$chance_h> Elden ring isn’t real, the world will end before it’s released
[1:08:52] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[1:09:05] <Paltheos> @chance_h You're thinking of Star Citizen
[1:09:13] <Jaysky> I can believe Elden Ring is real, but Silksong? Nah.
[1:09:13] <+Havictos> Hey when does elden ring come out again?
[1:09:32] <Vi_Stri> @TerpanderLux C H I B <3
[1:09:34] <+parrotman01> What the fuck is Silk Song
[1:09:43] <+parrotman01> Silksong is FAKE that's what it is
[1:09:46] <+parrotman01> Kappa
[1:09:47] <Jaysky> @parrotman01 An old wives tale
[1:09:56] <%TerpanderLux> @Vi_Stri chjb chjb chjb chjbHug
[1:10:00] <+polothegreatest> Silksong sofarfCry
[1:10:03] <Profmcstevie> Team Cherry lost scope control of Hollow Knight when it was in dev, I would not be surprised if Silksong is the same
[1:10:14] <%Bluwizard21> Silksong is like starcraft ghost
[1:10:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> man it'd be soooo cool if Star Citizen came out lmao
[1:10:40] <ExpressNode> We should get a 10 ten vaporware section in game awards
[1:10:51] <Jaysky> It never will in its promised state
[1:11:37] <+polothegreatest> Capcom titles at top 3
[1:11:47] <bleugh> hornet in a nova suit Kreygasm
[1:11:51] <+Havictos> @Profmcstevie Well considering Silksong was just supposed to be hornet dlc for hollow knight before it got so big they decided fuck it make it a sequel I can believe that
[1:11:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jaysky yo but if it does tho 👀 👀 👀 that'll be $60 well spent lol
[1:12:17] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> someone is really hungry
[1:12:18] <%sodamin1> @ReallyBigRocks at this point it'll just be a game thats forever in development, its so weird
[1:12:36] <Profmcstevie> Zangief has eaten Pat sugoiSadguts

[1:13:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Havictos it's "playable" and they upload literal hours of dev vlogs every week
[1:13:46] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I just imagine that pat and his son sit down to gether eat and have a good jolly convoy about life and mind goblins
[1:13:52] <%IronOhki> IT DOGE
[1:13:56] <SivSarcast> I like the previous Persona-esque Be Right Back theme ,but this one's good too.

[1:14:27] <%sodamin1> @Havictos as far as i know, there's like a hub area, a couple ships you can fly around and a ground area you can walk around and do quests etc.
[1:14:33] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> psaGib psaGiefrail
[1:14:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Goopy lad

[1:15:14] <%IronOhki> I've never seen a dog not go nuts for greenies. Those things must taste amazing to dog mouth.
[1:15:15] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Why does he run away every time?
[1:15:17] <tentavision> my dog does that too
[1:15:28] <LoneFonte> OOF
[1:15:33] <definitelynotjayy> oops
[1:15:36] <%TigerCatGo> NotLikeThis
[1:15:41] <%PocketBearIllustrator> wherever he borks, it swells my heart
[1:15:45] <%Agami23> i bet it was because they let people kiss their dogs
[1:15:47] <+polothegreatest> oh oh
[1:15:48] <brachydios777> was meatboy originly newgrounds?
[1:15:52] <%baka_sugoi> he's eating it with us LUL
[1:15:53] <dd44dostivei> THAT WAS A LOLO REFERENCE
[1:15:55] <%IronOhki> My cat actually learned a couple tricks. Slowly. Very slowly. Cats are stubborn assholes and not wired for tricks.
[1:15:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> Right they all just only wore masks when you were in front of them.
[1:16:01] <$sleepystardewfarmer> these are wild times we live in
[1:16:07] <Dunmarkh> @brachydios777 yeah
[1:16:08] <Ape_Law> oh this is gonna be a fun stream
[1:16:22] <Profmcstevie> Edmund Mcmillen was Newgrounds, so yes Meat Boy and Isaac are NG
[1:16:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> can't dogs catch Covid?
[1:16:30] <Jaysky> Oh I remember this story
[1:16:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> or was that early pandemic bs
[1:16:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> Lelelelele. The sound of Quebec,
[1:16:54] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> dogs can supposedly transmit covid
[1:16:54] <Jaysky> Cats can get covid
[1:17:02] <Profmcstevie> hon hon oui oui we spread the virus haha baguette
[1:17:11] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I gotta go to bed, but have fun with super meat boy, pat. take care, everyone
[1:17:15] <%TigerCatGo> Croissant, Baguette
[1:17:28] <%IronOhki> @PocketBearIllustrator Goodnight bear!
[1:17:30] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @pocketbearillustrator goodnight!
[1:17:34] <Jaysky> @PocketBearIllustrator Have a g'night! nyannComfy
[1:17:37] <SivSarcast> Don't touch the coke
[1:17:42] <+the_drummaestro> As a retail worker in Montreal, I have to tell every delivery to put on a mask because Covid doesn't exist for them apparently
[1:17:43] <%sporeian94> Why is Salt lethal to meat?
[1:17:49] <Profmcstevie> Cured Meat Boy D:
[1:17:52] <pitagor2> gnight
[1:17:54] <+the_drummaestro> delivery drivers*
[1:17:56] <+balkonas1> Why’s Pat playing Meat boy?  Wasnt there a plan for something else or im imaging it?
[1:17:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats a lotta salt
[1:18:00] <yukichocomilk> BloodTrail
[1:18:02] <%TigerCatGo> @Jaysky My 2 cats were really sneezey 2 mons ago....winder if that was it  :(
[1:18:05] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> if you have to salt your meat you have failed
[1:18:15] <%oda_flobunaga> Is it weird that when I learned French in school it was Québecois but we were taught the Parisian accent?
[1:18:15] <%za7az> PJSalt
[1:18:23] <brachydios777> Anyone remember there's no time to explain?
[1:18:28] <%TigerCatGo> @balkonas1 It was a Surprise Stream and this is the surprise lol
[1:18:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Meat boy gets a-salt-ed
[1:18:34] <tentavision> @sporeian94  ever heard of getting salt in a wound? salt+meat=pain
[1:18:52] <Jaysky> My workplace had someone catch covid recently and I only heard about it because of my best friend working in that department.
[1:19:04] <ergulor> i think you need another character for this one
[1:19:05] <Jaysky> So I guess we keep covid sickness a secret at a grocery store
[1:19:05] <jakernova> hello
[1:19:21] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @jaysky you could get them in some trouble
[1:19:39] <Jaysky> Sure could
[1:19:42] <+balkonas1> @tigercatgo makes sense then LUL
[1:19:50] <EynoStiles> @jaysky I hardly doubt that isnt happening now
[1:19:52] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> well they are getting themselves in trouble to be exact
[1:20:03] <@Ranryu692> @balkonas1 he was going to do the DS3 mod he's been playing recently, but he ended up doing it yesterday instead of Dishonored, so decided to do something else today
[1:20:25] <%IronOhki> The ways of Pat are a mystery to all.
[1:20:32] <Profmcstevie> I would HOPE all bandages are base meat boy accessible
[1:20:32] <%StarOtter70> Different Character probably
[1:20:32] <Jaysky> Might need another character
[1:20:34] <DrStinkers> is this going to turn into an episode of Pat vs mind goblins
[1:20:37] <BurdRightsActivist> STRAWBERRIES :2
[1:20:38] <%shurtal> do you retain jump if you just drop off a ledge?
[1:20:39] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @patstaresat DODGE
[1:20:45] <ergulor> a character with double jump most likely
[1:20:48] <pitagor2> probably some of the other characters
[1:20:53] <Jaysky> @shurtal Nay
[1:20:54] <%Agami23> just get it and avoid the salt
[1:20:58] <%XzileGaming> SimplePat
[1:21:03] <%robotoken> Pat is a man of mystery
[1:21:09] <brachydios777> I remember meatboy being hard as shit
[1:21:11] <%IronOhki> Pat is good video game man.
[1:21:11] <%Puhff> Time stop
[1:21:22] <bleugh> a bit bs if you need a different character
[1:21:31] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> is pat vs mind goblins still a ongoing series?
[1:21:32] <%pokefan9956> why does salt hurt meat boy?
[1:21:34] <%sporeian94> Is it fucke dup this game is making me hungry for burgers
[1:21:35] <%pokefan9956> he's just meat
[1:21:41] <+dawsfloss> it's important to have a well seasoned meat boy
[1:21:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> salt dry meat
[1:21:46] <Profmcstevie> He's not meat, he's skinless
[1:21:54] <Jaysky> @pokefan9956 Flesh meat. Ever poured salt in a wound?
[1:21:57] <Profmcstevie> so it's all salt in the wound
[1:21:59] <%IronOhki> @PoohTrailSnailCooch I thought the final chapter was Darkest Dungeon.
[1:22:01] <%StarOtter70> ?
[1:22:06] <%shurtal> Pat cut's down trees, eats his lunch, and has buttered scones for tea
[1:22:10] <%JobbedBone> adumN1 adumN2
[1:22:12] <%JobbedBone> adumN3 adumN4
[1:22:17] <%trekkie11041> drops at the beginning i think
[1:22:18] <%NitronStreams> i think it fell off the left
[1:22:26] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @ironohki ah okay thanks for the answer!
[1:22:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Man! I sure like meatboy! I hope they make a second one and expand on the platforming!
[1:22:50] <%StarOtter70> WARP ZOOOOOOOONE

[1:25:04] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> random statement but I just recently played evil within 1 again and was pleasantly at just how well of survival horror game it was. then the ending came around.
[1:25:17] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> surprisied*
[1:25:44] <Dunmarkh> LUL

[1:28:23] <jakernova> going on 2022 and I never played this game
[1:28:29] <didjorno> Meat King
[1:28:42] <VarcitE> This game was made by people who hate games
[1:29:04] <%IronOhki> Woof.
[1:29:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Jesus
[1:29:21] <didjorno> oofy doofy
[1:29:21] <%pokefan9956> @VarcitE ?
[1:29:27] <%CalderGaming> @VarcitE this game was made by people who love OLD games
[1:29:31] <didjorno> the double keys are brutal
[1:29:39] <%IronOhki> @VarcitE this
[1:30:02] <%oda_flobunaga> Back when Ninja Gaiden was a sidescroller
[1:30:07] <bleugh> this is a male power fantasy
[1:30:26] <%IronOhki> @bleugh What isn't?
[1:30:28] <didjorno> n+ shit
[1:30:42] <+Havictos> So a question about Elden Ring How did George R.R. Martin even get involved with it? Was somebody at Fromsoft a fan or something?
[1:30:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> OH THE FUCKING SALT FACTORY I HATED THE SALT FACTORY
[1:30:58] <%CalderGaming> PJSalt
[1:31:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> This and Hell were the worst

[1:31:44] <@Pandora_Prime> That gun is in a really dickish spot
[1:31:51] <Ipsenscastle> the replay of this one is gonna be a fireworks show at the start
[1:31:57] <%NitronStreams> yeeeeh
[1:32:00] <didjorno> wholesome monhun
[1:32:00] <yukichocomilk> my gf and i have been playing together, good times <3
[1:32:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Awww
[1:32:09] <Ipsenscastle> having a monster-hunter playing partner is the dream
[1:32:11] <SaltyAzteca> Fuck you Tigrex.... <3
[1:32:25] <didjorno> Sounds like a cute stream at least
[1:32:28] <vile_brand> and then she begs you to help her navigate the menu
[1:32:32] <%shurtal> except for that guy
[1:32:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> What weapon do you think paige will gravatate towards?
[1:32:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Something tells me she'd like Diablos.
[1:32:37] <%IronOhki> Pat doesn't want to be the guy (the movie the game.)
[1:32:39] <%shurtal> that guy TOTALLY wants to be that
[1:32:40] <didjorno> Rise or World?
[1:32:46] <Ape_Law> i love you tigrex, tigrex forced me to get good at the game
[1:32:49] <SomeStrangeBroad> fuck that guy
[1:32:50] <%zeroarturia> I hope. I loved when Max and Jae Jae streamed MH World together
[1:32:50] <Ipsenscastle> big hammor
[1:32:51] <MyNameIsRasus> greatsword
[1:32:52] <@ssjklyco> Best case scenario is she starts near one shotting the harder monsters
[1:32:52] <ergulor> hammer?
[1:32:57] <VarcitE> Everytime meat boy dies the pandemic extends 6 months
[1:32:57] <%StarOtter70> Crossbow Kappa
[1:33:05] <+tempestzephyr> the tiniest weapon for sure lol
[1:33:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> so Sword and Board?
[1:33:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Greatsword
[1:33:16] <SaltyAzteca> @Ape_Law And then you had to fight 2 at the same time
[1:33:16] <didjorno> Can you give her a briefing video before hand or is she going in blind?
[1:33:19] <%RetroCop87> speaking of that guy, what are your thoughts on i wanna be the guy?
[1:33:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Or hammer?
[1:33:27] <+rafaelba93> give her a gun
[1:33:31] <+rafaelba93> lol
[1:33:31] <+polothegreatest> SnS sofarfThink
[1:33:33] <%DeadStage> just don't let her use longsword fuck LS users
[1:33:35] <$sleepystardewfarmer> you said you like great sword, right?
[1:33:35] <%Puhff> HAMMER
[1:33:36] <%dasmause> what about lance?
[1:33:38] <@ssjklyco> Dual Blades
[1:33:38] <%GabeSweetMan> "I wanna be that guy"
[1:33:39] <%MooseIsGoose> Sns
[1:33:40] <Ape_Law> swax, swax isn't great sword but is big cool weapon
[1:33:40] <ergulor> Brownie
[1:33:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> HUNTING HORN FTW
[1:33:42] <%oda_flobunaga> Every time Meatboy dies another Corona variant pops up
[1:33:43] <Pookiedaexzile> But it would be funny
[1:33:49] <Profmcstevie> I suspect hammer or GS, she wants to smash
[1:33:50] <%Valdorick> Gamer God PeachSalivia? Give her the most technical weapon possible.
[1:33:58] <+Mrbaconator> doot doot motherfucker
[1:33:59] <%StarOtter70> Glaive
[1:34:02] <%CalderGaming> she takes a while to respect the length of any long weapons so hammer would avoid that whole complication lol
[1:34:03] <yukichocomilk> ranged weapons are pretty easy to start
[1:34:07] <Profmcstevie> Hunting Horn Paige never buffs, only swings
[1:34:08] <%GabeSweetMan> The most unga possible
[1:34:08] <%MooseIsGoose> Make it the charge blade
[1:34:10] <tentavision> shit boy?!?
[1:34:11] <didjorno> God not glaive
[1:34:12] <MyNameIsRasus> it's peepoo
[1:34:12] <markymark13_> Hunting Horn
[1:34:14] <%CalderGaming> Super Poop Boy
[1:34:17] <%sporeian94> MY SALT OVERFLOWETH
[1:34:18] <+ALazo> she's gonna insist on greatsword because big isn't she
[1:34:20] <%DeadStage> ranged weapons also don't give a very good impression of what the game is
[1:34:21] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Give her any weapon that starts with a good bone material and she will love the way it looks
[1:34:25] <%CalderGaming> Fecal Vergil
[1:34:27] <%watts121> @Profmcstevie they fixed that in Rise
[1:34:28] <didjorno> return of peepoo
[1:34:36] <SaltyAzteca> The poops so slippery
[1:34:37] <Razeino> Browine
[1:34:42] <%TigerCatGo> Husband tried to get me into Destiny 2. I just can't do FPS shooters and loot-collecting NotLikeThis
[1:34:46] <%Bluwizard21> I first learned about the run button thanks to this guy
[1:34:57] <%YakumoYomi> @Profmcstevie In Rise, that isn't an issue. By default, just attacking gives you your buffs
[1:34:57] <+天使42199> poop is faster then meat
[1:35:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Destiny 2 kinda sucks too
[1:35:04] <%sporeian94> This is live footage of my intestines right now after eating an entire pan of hamburger helper in one sitting like a goddamn animal
[1:35:17] <MyNameIsRasus> @sporeian94 LUL
[1:35:20] <Profmcstevie> Oh does it Buff everyone automatically in Rise? Wild
[1:35:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[1:35:27] <Jaysky> Is it the fecal funny?
[1:35:33] <%StarOtter70> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeea
[1:35:33] <+kewlmyc> F
[1:35:37] <Ape_Law> fuck destiny 2, every dlc i paid for is gone or going away and i cant play them anymore
[1:35:38] <SaltyAzteca> You just got out sharted
[1:35:39] <didjorno> fecal funny tm
[1:35:43] <MyNameIsRasus> It do indeed be the fecal funny
[1:35:43] <brachydios777> poop funny
[1:35:43] <Razeino> The Shadow vs Sonic race?
[1:35:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Zangief is rootinf for you at least
[1:35:49] <Profmcstevie> Pooped on
[1:35:51] <Haxzzer> vargMAMA
[1:35:56] <+天使42199> @Ape_Law what do you mean by that ?
[1:36:05] <%Infernal_Dalek> Bloody Meat and Poo moving through your intestines after Taco Bell
[1:36:13] <%Infernal_Dalek> being chased by flood of salt

[1:40:31] <Swine_Slime> nyannJam
[1:40:32] <mr_saturday93> honestly though I wanna see how weapon crafting works when th new expansion comes out
[1:40:35] <+Mechanized82> Well they wanted D2 to be the WoW of fps, they've succeeded. Everyone hates it now.
[1:40:37] <afronooch> "Hope you enjoy this rad thing in the middle of all the shit"
[1:40:40] <%oda_flobunaga> So Destiny 2 is like Twitter?
[1:40:41] <brachydios777> Bungie was doing a decent job with the anniversary too, god damn it
[1:40:49] <%TerpanderLux> EleGiggle
[1:40:51] <TheShockVox> @mynameisrasus BloodTrail
[1:40:54] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> all seems very systematic
[1:40:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O saved!
[1:40:58] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I just wanted a cool space shoot game. Why all this shit
[1:41:04] <heartlesshealer> It was never good
[1:41:06] <Ape_Law> I'm still mad about the dlc i paid for being "vaulted"
[1:41:07] <brachydios777> every year
[1:41:07] <%DeadStage> destiny 2 self sabotaging almost as much as PSO2 does
[1:41:08] <+polothegreatest> MMO route expansions NotLikeThis PJSalt
[1:41:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @oda_flobunaga That implies twitter was cool at all
[1:41:09] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> just like the gaas fanbase community
[1:41:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O oh no it's ruined again
[1:41:10] <+Kyma1020> It's like they planned this
[1:41:11] <TallYoda08> Ok stop atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:41:11] <mr_saturday93> I'm just there for the story tbh
[1:41:14] <%strakillias> Destiny is the drunk husband of videogames
[1:41:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Havictos at least warframe is okay
[1:41:20] <+vanareus> too be fair, people have been saying 76 is good despite core mechanics not working
[1:41:35] <Profmcstevie> I'd be fine if they transitioned the game OFF gaas and just turned it into not-halo
[1:41:37] <mr_saturday93> what's good about 76?
[1:41:41] <heartlesshealer> 76 is good if you like class war
[1:41:42] <%IronOhki> @doc_ock_rokc Eh... kinda.
[1:41:45] <%Bluwizard21> just like politics. they make -100 then give back 40 rinse and repeat every year
[1:41:45] <Mister_McDerp> good again? when was it ever good?
[1:41:58] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> people are just saying 76 is good now because xbox is shilling people
[1:41:58] <%IronOhki> @mr_saturday93 God game, perfect in every way, no flaws, great rum.
[1:42:08] <slipdog> d1 taken king
[1:42:11] <+Mechanized82> The Taken King is GOAT
[1:42:17] <+Kyma1020> Taken King and Forsaken were really good
[1:42:18] <Ape_Law> i loved destiny 1
[1:42:21] <TheShockVox> I still have never touched a single Destiny. Turned off by how I heard destiny 1 was
[1:42:23] <Jaysky> "It was good when IIIIII played it"
[1:42:26] <KahnWick> Just play FF XIV or ESO or something, Destiny 2 seems to love self-sabotage
[1:42:26] <+Kyma1020> Dawn
[1:42:28] <%StarOtter70> Season of the Witch
[1:42:30] <afronooch> Worthy?
[1:42:31] <%Treuan> Undying?
[1:42:31] <mr_saturday93> @ironohki burh cum on
[1:42:32] <afronooch> dawn
[1:42:35] <heartlesshealer> Unless all the tools to troll other players were taken out, then 76 is worse than nothing again
[1:42:47] <vile_brand> is that the true tragedy pat? that destiny was at one point good?
[1:42:47] <mr_saturday93> Honestly I didn't like dawn
[1:42:49] <%IronOhki> @mr_saturday93 I kid
[1:42:54] <+chiazam> This really is the Dark Souls of platforming
[1:43:02] <+Havictos> @vanareus I have yet to have anyone convince that 76 should ever existed at all. I don't understand the point of multiplayer fallout
[1:43:09] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I cant stand gaas's there's usually never preservation in mind
[1:43:12] <ShinyVagikarp> truuu
[1:43:15] <+Mechanized82> no it's the kings field of platforming
[1:43:17] <+Havictos> @vanareus Convince me
[1:43:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> isn't Dark Souls the Super Meat Boy of action RPGs?
[1:43:27] <%NitronStreams> aint this pre dark souls?
[1:43:29] <ExpressNode> This is the dark souls for those with dark souls
[1:43:29] <mr_saturday93> Season of the chosen and splicer were good
[1:43:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Pat....Darksouls was the MEATBOY of hacknslash
[1:43:30] <%StarOtter70> Forsaken Meat
[1:43:31] <dd44dostivei> Ithought that was castlevania
[1:43:34] <Mister_McDerp> I thought dark souls was the dark souls of platforming
[1:43:40] <brachydios777> I play Destiny 2, so believe me when I say that this change is stupid
[1:43:46] <%StephanieSadGirl> Im here, im finally here, did I miss the vore?
[1:43:50] <+vanareus> @heartlesshealer some were but most aren't. people still post about trap houses daily but remeber: 76 has the best community /s
[1:43:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Hang on, what year is SMB?
[1:43:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah also DS IS a platformer
[1:43:52] <%RetroCop87> The Prinny game for the PSP is the bloodborne of platformers
[1:43:52] <%oda_flobunaga> This predates DS by an alot.  Technically, DS is the Meat Boy of Action RPGs
[1:43:53] <+polothegreatest> F76 should stayed MMO non canon
[1:43:53] <dd44dostivei> castlevania?
[1:44:00] <vile_brand> i miss skill based games.
[1:44:04] <+Mechanized82> actually the kings field of platforming is probably cat mario
[1:44:04] <%IronOhki> @brachydios777 I also play Des2. It's really bad.
[1:44:07] <@Ranryu692> @StephanieSadGirl I noticed a lack of mpreg talk in the chat
[1:44:17] <%IronOhki> No one hates Des2 more than people who love Des2.
[1:44:17] <%CalderGaming> [thinks back to dark souls 1's original jump control] calling something the dark souls of platforming is NOT a compliment
[1:44:24] <%Bluwizard21> Destiny 2 peaked for me when I got the assault rifle that just had your entire ammo supply in one clip. I was a sexual tyrannosaurus
[1:44:27] <+Kyma1020> Like Season of Chosen and Splicer were pretty good but man I got burnt out by Lost and completely lost interest when they were sunsetting more zones for the next expansion
[1:44:27] <%RetroCop87> stop looking mpreg
[1:44:29] <TheShockVox> Hate the trend of non-mmo games putting in MMO shit. Like Xenoverse 2. You’re a repetitive mediocre game that overstayed its welcome, who gave you the right to have timed exclusive RAIDS?!
[1:44:30] <%DeadStage> but pat you love mpreg
[1:44:30] <%StephanieSadGirl> @StephanieSadGirl See, without me this chat would have no direction
[1:44:31] <%StarOtter70> LUL
[1:44:31] <+emperri> stop talking about mpreg FeelsBadMan
[1:44:31] <heartlesshealer> @vanareus If you can't pay for good things, you can pay to destroy things for money-havers
[1:44:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Because it bothers you Pat.
[1:44:34] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> what's mpreg?
[1:44:34] <%StephanieSadGirl> I WILL NEVER STOP PAT
[1:44:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> mgreg
[1:44:37] <Mister_McDerp> the orb is mpreg
[1:44:40] <+Mechanized82> didn't know this was going to be a sexy chat
[1:44:40] <mr_saturday93> honestly des2 is a love hate relationship
[1:44:43] <Pookiedaexzile> If your Dads Meatboy do you get skin
[1:44:45] <Dunmarkh> @SaltkeyAndAckfish male pregnancy
[1:44:47] <marvel877> We talking about PAT MPREG again?
[1:44:50] <%HairballCT> PatStaresAt chat talking about mpreg
[1:44:50] <%linSP> because its cool
[1:44:50] <fIashman92> @SaltkeyAndAckfish A video format
[1:44:54] <+天使42199> mpregnate
[1:44:57] <$chance_h> Muh’preg
[1:44:57] <Profmcstevie> Super mpreg for the SNES
[1:45:01] <heartlesshealer> Would you rather us talk about MLAC, Pat?
[1:45:05] <%IronOhki> @HairballCT Well spent. Got im.
[1:45:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh
[1:45:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> GregPregsAt
[1:45:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> that's kinda nice
[1:45:09] <brachydios777> Destiny 2 do be "I hate it, its my favorite game" enegy
[1:45:11] <@Ranryu692> what's worse, mpreg or whussy?
[1:45:14] <Mister_McDerp> impregnate that bussy
[1:45:14] <%Bluwizard21> whatever happened to the "thats so hot" guy?
[1:45:18] <+Mechanized82> mmm that orbulent male womb
[1:45:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> pat pregs at?
[1:45:21] <+emperri> I encode all my video files in .mpreg
[1:45:23] <+Kyma1020> Dead Man's Tale still my favorite semi auto rifle
[1:45:25] <%oda_flobunaga> No Mpreg? the vore?
[1:45:25] <TheShockVox> More like…mmm, preg?
[1:45:25] <%StephanieSadGirl> cheer500 I will never stop talking about Mpreg, there is nothing you can do! (besides ban me, but that'd be mean) maxmor2Teefs
[1:45:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> mprussy
[1:45:28] <%oda_flobunaga> then
[1:45:29] <marvel877> mpreg the whussy
[1:45:30] <brachydios777> *energy
[1:45:33] <%DeadStage> I never took an interest in mpreg until my favourite influence, Patrick Boivin, a true patrician of mpreg, introduced me to it.
[1:45:34] <+天使42199> whats whussy ? is it like bussy ?
[1:45:34] <zekana> pat, you playing as a cube of meat.  what dog wouldn't want that?
[1:45:36] <KahnWick> 76 is okay, but id much rather get away from that godawful art style 4 and 76 have
[1:45:37] <%IronOhki> Now you're thinking with portals.
[1:45:39] <slipdog> patussy
[1:45:47] <+Havictos> I got bored of Destiny 2 when that burst nanobot rifle came out. I got it shot it a few times and asked myself "am I having fun?" I wasn't so I stopped
[1:45:48] <+Walopoh> first try Clap
[1:45:55] <SaltyAzteca> BEAT THOSE GOBBOLINS
[1:45:56] <%RetroCop87> ONIICHAN
[1:46:00] <+Havictos> How long ago was that?
[1:46:06] <mr_saturday93> I genuinely wonder sometimes what would Paige do if pat just woke up and grew like 2 feet taller with 6 pack abs
[1:46:11] <Profmcstevie> No surrender
[1:46:14] <+Mechanized82> next come the rockets
[1:46:14] <brachydios777> Dead Man's Tell still one of the funnest Scout Rifles
[1:46:15] <%Dakuu75> I use to be decent at these kinds of platformers. Now i'm too old lol
[1:46:16] <+polothegreatest> Hope new bethesda engine pays off
[1:46:22] <+vanareus> @kahnwick it's really not. hit detection is still ass and it took them 3 years to make energy weapons work as intended
[1:46:25] <%GabeSweetMan> I actually kind liked this mechanic.
[1:46:26] <slipdog> @polothegreatest LUL
[1:46:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Literally 1984
[1:46:43] <TheShockVox> @polothegreatest Wait wait hold on. They have a new engine?
[1:46:46] <dd44dostivei> i beat this back in the day but now i feel too old to start celeste
[1:46:46] <%RetroCop87> WAIT AFTER THE FIRST LOOP
[1:47:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> grab bandage?
[1:47:13] <%DeadStage> Satan's rave beams
[1:47:17] <%TigerCatGo> I've never played MeatBoy but these levels look instense
[1:47:20] <stormhawk9891> Oh that's just mean
[1:47:20] <+Mechanized82> @dd44dostivei Celeste is easier unless you go for the secret levels
[1:47:28] <%NitronStreams> this some bull shit
[1:47:28] <%Dakuu75> this music sounds a little like Crypt of the Necrodancer stuff
[1:47:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta platform
[1:47:30] <%Kaask> this is pretty cool looking
[1:47:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> @TigerCatGo YOU HAVE NO IDEA
[1:47:43] <%GabeSweetMan> There are skips on this stage, but it's way easier to be patient.
[1:47:44] <Profmcstevie> Celeste is VERY playable, it's just got a high skill ceiling for THE GOOD SHIT
[1:47:47] <+polothegreatest> yeah?  MS Money i Guess. Dunno
[1:47:48] <+Walopoh> @Dakuu75 same composer
[1:47:57] <vile_brand> man pat when you get it right you make it look easy
[1:47:58] <%TigerCatGo> Paige noises
[1:48:07] <zekana> @TigerCatGo they are tough but they look easy compared to the dark world levels of the game
[1:48:07] <@Ranryu692> @Dakuu75 ah, that's why it's so familiar
[1:48:10] <SaltyAzteca> the fuck is that
[1:48:13] <%GabeSweetMan> It's so sad streamelements died of ligma.
[1:48:14] <SomeStrangeBroad> I would not have the patience for this
[1:48:15] <%Dakuu75> @Walopoh ah ok, dope
[1:48:16] <+Mechanized82> yeah these guys suck butt
[1:48:17] <dd44dostivei> yyyyyeeeeaaahhh these guys
[1:48:18] <SaltyAzteca> LANGOLIERS
[1:48:20] <mattymcfilth> and here we go
[1:48:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> It is so sad steve jobs died of legima
[1:48:26] <vile_brand> its a langolier
[1:48:29] <%TigerCatGo> @doc_ock_rokc psaDogchamp

[1:49:39] <Tracazoid> Patpreg
[1:49:49] <%GabeSweetMan> I might just use my sub dono message to talk about mpreg now. Out of spite.
[1:49:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> shit talking is even better when they can't defend themselves
[1:49:58] <SomeStrangeBroad> bleh my head aches
[1:49:59] <brachydios777> wtf happened to chat?
[1:49:59] <%oda_flobunaga> Would Jason Voorhees be better if he was Jason Vorehees instead?
[1:50:01] <%Bluwizard21> I spent so long in hell that I heard this song in my dreams
[1:50:07] <%DeadStage> How old is Super Meat Boy now? It's gonna make me feel ancient if I find out.
[1:50:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> HEY CHAT! What animated shit do y'all want im gonna start working on it after dinner and im tired and don't want to think
[1:50:12] <%StephanieSadGirl> @brachydios777 I arrived
[1:50:13] <BurdRightsActivist> They aren't moving KEKW
[1:50:20] <slipdog> @DeadStage 22
[1:50:27] <marvel877> Are those effin Langoliers?
[1:50:27] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> once upon a time, there was a pat who had a greaaat big space in his belly
[1:50:29] <vile_brand> @doc_ock_rokc dancing dickbutt
[1:50:29] <dd44dostivei> i beat mega man 1 for the first time today, and i think this is def worse
[1:50:36] <%StephanieSadGirl> @doc_ock_rokc I want a shitty video of Plague holding pat's mpreg orb while Paige stands there going 'oh my boys'
[1:50:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Wait does it just spawn them even if another is still on screen???
[1:50:43] <%IronOhki> @doc_ock_rokc Ugh that's a really awesome question but I got nothing at the moment.
[1:50:49] <%oda_flobunaga> Meatboy came out in 2008
[1:50:50] <%GabeSweetMan> MM1 is jank.
[1:50:51] <slipdog> i beat mega man 1 without realizing you could change weapons
[1:50:55] <%RetroCop87> i wanna be the guy sucks, but in a fun way
[1:50:56] <+Catpurnicus> play mega man 7, the weird one
[1:50:59] <Profmcstevie> These are THE enemy in this game to watch out for
[1:51:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> I like Megaman 1, but it sucks
[1:51:00] <dd44dostivei> it's really badly programmed
[1:51:00] <brachydios777> Those are Lanoleirs
[1:51:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Wanna fight about 2 vs 3?
[1:51:03] <%DeadStage> 2008 sounds about right, geeze
[1:51:05] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Are those fucking stephen king Langoliers?
[1:51:07] <Enn19> Boy do I love memorizing platforms that disappear over spikes
[1:51:08] <%Agami23> are you a megaman 2 or megaman 3 kinda person?
[1:51:08] <Azathotic> Question: Are any classic Mega Mans considered "good" aside from 2?
[1:51:09] <+polothegreatest> Hard NotLikeThis
[1:51:09] <%Bluwizard21> or why megaman x just blew the original out of the water
[1:51:21] <%StarOtter70> 8 voice acted
[1:51:23] <%Buzzard42> @Azathotic 3
[1:51:24] <%RetroCop87> which one has Snake Man?
[1:51:25] <brachydios777> *langoleirs
[1:51:27] <%Buzzard42> Mega Man 3 rules
[1:51:27] <Azathotic> Because I swear nobody likes OG Mega Man aside from the second
[1:51:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah but needless fandom wars tho.
[1:51:30] <dd44dostivei> controls constantly freeze up when there's stuff happening on the screen
[1:51:30] <+天使42199> wow this enemy looks like it bites ass
[1:51:31] <%Buzzard42> Mega Man 5's also pretty great
[1:51:33] <%IronOhki> 3
[1:51:34] <+Catpurnicus> 2 and 3 are both great
[1:51:34] <marvel877> 3
[1:51:35] <slipdog> whichever one has those dumb water platforms DansGame
[1:51:35] <Jaysky> @Azathotic 3, 4, debatably 6.
[1:51:37] <+Mechanized82> MM1 is way too hard and full of BS, when robot masters hit you they do like 1/3rd of your life bar in damage
[1:51:37] <Razeino> 5 was my favorite
[1:51:38] <%RetroCop87> 3 is best then
[1:51:41] <%Jhylla81> snake man is 3 I think
[1:51:42] <marvel877> 3 had snake
[1:51:44] <satiresatyr> i have never played a megaman game but watched the cartoons SirSad
[1:51:47] <Jaysky> 6 has Rush upgrades
[1:51:48] <brachydios777> Protoman rules
[1:51:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> METAL MAN
[1:51:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Which Robot Master theme? Magnet Man for me.
[1:51:49] <@Ranryu692> only mainline Mega Man game I've played is X7
[1:51:51] <+ScrapKingKeita> Crash Man for best theme tho
[1:51:52] <%IronOhki> I loved snakes in general for years after Snakeman
[1:51:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would you make a Snake man
[1:51:54] <+StooEsq> Same thing with Revenge of Shinobi and Shinobi 3
[1:51:56] <+Catpurnicus> 3 has all the bosses of 2 in it anyway
[1:51:56] <Azathotic> @Jaysky Was 6 the SNES one or the PS1 one?
[1:51:57] <+polothegreatest> X is way easier, x6 being exception
[1:52:04] <+DrBunni> I just got dark souls 3 and the DLC, any tips for a caster?
[1:52:07] <+ggbhtg> Snake Man theme is top tayier
[1:52:07] <%Buzzard42> 2 and 3 are the best, 5 is good, 4 is playable, and 6 is rough
[1:52:09] <Jaysky> @Azathotic NES still
[1:52:10] <+Catpurnicus> but I like 2's soundtrack better
[1:52:16] <+vanareus> @havictos yeah, it's certainly not the most unstable Bethesda game. (tho it used to crash on me frequently at launch)
[1:52:18] <%GabeSweetMan> 6 was NES
[1:52:19] <%Buzzard42> 7 and 8 don't count
[1:52:20] <vile_brand> i've never played any megaman game. which are good?
[1:52:23] <marvel877> 6 was NES, 7 was SNES, 8 PS1
[1:52:26] <+天使42199> @polothegreatest Id say x3 gets kinda rough too tbh
[1:52:27] <Jaysky> SNES is Megaman X and 7 is PS1
[1:52:31] <%IronOhki> I still can't wrap my brain around how good some NES music could be.
[1:52:32] <Razeino> The charge buster mechanic sucks especially with that god awful sound effect.
[1:52:35] <%RetroCop87> Megaman 9 had a bomb soundtrack
[1:52:38] <%StarOtter70> monkaS
[1:52:39] <brachydios777> Pharoh Man is also the shit
[1:52:43] <+Catpurnicus> just play 2, 3, and X, like all of us did
[1:52:50] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> LUL
[1:52:51] <BurdRightsActivist> HOLY SHIT.
[1:52:58] <+tempestzephyr> what an asshole move
[1:52:58] <Jaysky> I liked Megaman 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Didn't get to play 10.
[1:52:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its HELL pat
[1:53:03] <@SoFarFetched> I streamed X-X4 and thats pretty much the entire series sofarfPog
[1:53:05] <%GabeSweetMan> @Catpurnicus MM. Yup this is the correct answer.
[1:53:05] <+donkeypunch720> I don't think Pat is beating Cotton Alley guys...
[1:53:08] <+天使42199> @vile_brand from the X series: x1 and x4 are top tier, megaman 2 and 3 are good like they just said. Megaman zero series also dope
[1:53:19] <%GabeSweetMan> I love other games in the series but 2, 3, and X are peak Megaman.
[1:53:19] <slipdog> nice!
[1:53:20] <%IronOhki> Larg brain.
[1:53:22] <SaltyAzteca> CLEAN
[1:53:25] <+天使42199> x2 is also cool
[1:53:26] <%StarOtter70> Nice
[1:53:29] <sriracha_cream> that was SICK, pat
[1:53:31] <mike2hands> mike2h1POG mike2h1POG mike2h1POG mike2h1POG
[1:53:32] <SaltyAzteca> DATED MEMES
[1:53:33] <%CalderGaming> FURTHER THAN EVER YEEEEAAAAAH

[1:53:36] <Darthkitten_Prime> Worst boss incoming
[1:53:38] <Profmcstevie> Oy
[1:53:38] <heartlesshealer> good job!
[1:53:40] <brachydios777> Nice
[1:53:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> it's because of the extra brain growing in pat's stomack
[1:53:42] <%IronOhki> Pat brain so mighty and hooj.
[1:53:43] <%CalderGaming> it's YOUUUUU
[1:53:43] <KasiCrafter> Now for a PURE bull boss
[1:53:46] <%DeadStage> wrinkles begin to form on pat's brain, a joyous occasion
[1:53:46] <+polothegreatest> Just play X3 with playable Zero mod sofarfIQ
[1:53:48] <BurdRightsActivist> LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT HEADSMASH
[1:53:54] <%StarOtter70> MEGA MEAT
[1:53:57] <%IronOhki> @SaltkeyAndAckfish That makes so much sense.
[1:53:57] <Swine_Slime> nyannJam
[1:53:59] <slipdog> this might be the dumbest boss in gaming
[1:54:01] <%CalderGaming> I AM A TESTAMENT TO ALL YOUR SINS
[1:54:02] <Enn19> Pat play this game before? He's pretty good at it
[1:54:05] <dd44dostivei> @vile_brand 2 and X1
[1:54:09] <%GabeSweetMan> The autoscroller boss.
[1:54:11] <wally_whatever> Worst boss best theme
[1:54:13] <%maenos2> oh its THIS boss
[1:54:17] <+天使42199> I am the great mighty meat and ive come to throw my meat at you
[1:54:19] <brachydios777> extra lives sent to hell?
[1:54:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Really
[1:54:23] <%TheAntiNihilist> Lol
[1:54:25] <%TigerCatGo> Is this the beat-up baby????
[1:54:25] <Profmcstevie> The legendarily worst boss of the game
[1:54:27] <%GabeSweetMan> This boss if fun for no one.
[1:54:29] <+Havictos> @天使42199 The Zero series and ZX games are great too
[1:54:33] <%oda_flobunaga> BEAT YOUR MEAT
[1:54:43] <Jaysky> Was this boss really that widely hated? Cause I hated it too
[1:54:47] <mike2hands> NotLikeThis
[1:54:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Any other Battle Network fans in here?
[1:54:53] <SaltyAzteca> lol
[1:54:53] <BurdRightsActivist> This is super dookey
[1:54:54] <%cade_calrayn> Zangief is upset at how terrible you are at this, Pat
[1:54:54] <%TheAntiNihilist> Wowie
[1:54:54] <+Mechanized82> lul
[1:54:59] <BackflipCharm> Yeah this boss actually just sucks
[1:55:01] <Profmcstevie> It's a 0 skill boss, just know the pattern lmnao
[1:55:02] <SaltyAzteca> @GabeSweetMan ye
[1:55:05] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:55:06] <+天使42199> @Havictos yeah I like those games too. Megaman zero 1 is kinda eh but starting from zero 2 it gets real good
[1:55:08] <slipdog> Bed of Chaos sounds fun right now
[1:55:10] <brachydios777> fuck that
[1:55:19] <%W1nterTitan> "you know, Woolie, Super Meat Boy is a lot like fighting games"
[1:55:20] <wqorst> prog stream
[1:55:30] <bigwompor> SourPls
[1:55:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Meat of CHAOS
[1:55:32] <%Bluwizard21> lies
[1:55:36] <%Bluwizard21> it has way better hitboxes
[1:55:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> bed of meat
[1:55:38] <%TigerCatGo> Meat of Chaos
[1:55:38] <%Agami23> its an ff14 extreme trial
[1:55:42] <akitanito> does this fight at least have checkpoints
[1:55:43] <%greasypete00> you knew and you just stood there anyway
[1:55:43] <Azathotic> No because this boss is somewhat fun
[1:55:43] <+donkeypunch720> cool pixel animation though
[1:55:44] <BurdRightsActivist> KEKW
[1:55:45] <%IronOhki> @W1nterTitan I mean, it's like turning the key on Woolie's ignition.
[1:55:47] <Profmcstevie> Boy I SAW the hitboxes on Bed of Chaos, what unbelievable SHIT
[1:55:49] <%RetroCop87> real talk though, Hell in Cave Story was fucking sick
[1:55:52] <ExpressNode> Just on my PS3 and it fucking sucks that I have to get on my PS5 to add money.
[1:55:55] <BurdRightsActivist> HEALERSA DJUST
[1:56:06] <+polothegreatest> Crystal farming. Is hell PJSalt
[1:56:10] <faiz_saad> just a pattern Hhhehehe
[1:56:16] <+Havictos> @天使42199 Admittedly Zero 1 had some series bullshit like having to level your basic combo that was awful
[1:56:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Cave Story's Hell is awesome. The lowest time I could get was 4:22.
[1:56:20] <%Agami23> eventually he'll say "you dont have to explain it to me in fighting game terms" like he did with port and starboard
[1:56:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Couldn't quite get to 4:20 T_T
[1:56:46] <Pookiedaexzile> What if the telegraph meant you were to late
[1:56:47] <%psidefx> Red went down a dark road
[1:56:48] <vile_brand> the worst thing you can have is a shit boss with shit music
[1:56:54] <brachydios777> who was the asshole who made this boss?
[1:56:59] <ExpressNode> I never want to do cave story hell, and that time is way more impressive than mine
[1:57:00] <%TigerCatGo> Ok, Gym-Time!! It's Arms&Back Day!! Have a MEATEY FRIDAY, EVERYONE sipsipHellmo
[1:57:09] <+天使42199> @Havictos Yeah I just found zero 1 kinda dull, like the soundtrack didnt really stand out but again they definitely stepped up with the other games
[1:57:09] <ExpressNode> I mean again
[1:57:24] <%Agami23> hey pat, did you see that stupid KI rumor going around?
[1:57:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Worst boss. Everyone remembers this pain.
[1:57:44] <%StarOtter70> KI Arena Fighter
[1:57:55] <%Agami23> thats not true, it could be a capcom game
[1:57:59] <%Buzzard42> @GabeSweetMan Sacred Ground rules
[1:57:59] <Profmcstevie> It's time for Cyberconnect2 to make a Killer Instinct Storm Kappa
[1:58:00] <brachydios777> I doubt those rumors
[1:58:01] <@Pandora_Prime> Its like an Ex Trial
[1:58:04] <yukichocomilk> delay netcode LUL
[1:58:06] <marvel877> Namco? So it will have terrible online, got it.
[1:58:22] <xhodocto385> hello, oh its the BloodTrail game
[1:58:27] <@ssjklyco> So Rare is just dead then? They arent' making the new Perfet dark and if Namco makes KI, that's another game Rare isn't making.
[1:58:33] <+Mechanized82> Imagine of ASW did it in their style
[1:58:34] <%hairtoday> thins boss kinda sucks
[1:58:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> Oh this is the kind of boss that would make me never pick up the game again
[1:58:55] <akitanito> gief doesn't care for the boss
[1:58:59] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I would bark at it to if I was a dog
[1:59:03] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Sea of Thieves is the Apex Legends of Rare
[1:59:03] <%moon_king> psaDab
[1:59:05] <ExpressNode> Rare has been dead
[1:59:07] <+emperri> OhMyDog
[1:59:09] <Profmcstevie> It's the boss everyone mentions, it's such a weird change from EVERY other boss
[1:59:12] <mr_saturday93> isn't rare updating sea of thieves?
[1:59:13] <xhodocto385> Rare is all Sea of Thieves now.
[1:59:13] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[1:59:15] <+polothegreatest> LUL I believe bamco just take MS money and make PS games
[1:59:16] <Jaysky> Rare isn't dead, Rare just makes shit.
[1:59:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> PAT KILLED HIMSELF
[1:59:17] <+Mechanized82> he want kiss
[1:59:18] <slipdog> memorize better
[1:59:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> EVERYONE LAUGh
[1:59:20] <mike2hands> OH NYOOO PAT
[1:59:20] <brachydios777> rules of 3
[1:59:22] <%Kaask> psaWrong
[1:59:24] <%SharkMissile> I don't enjoy this boss fight much
[1:59:25] <BakaTyler> Rare's not dead! They got that super cool sea of thieves game with Jack Black
[1:59:36] <%TerpanderLux> boy is it moon2W
[1:59:37] <mike2hands> YOU CAN DO IT PAT!! STAY FROSTY
[1:59:43] <%StephanieSadGirl> Why did I just have a sudden burst of inspriation to mod Baba is You to replace Baba with Paige, both in name and sprite?
[1:59:50] <@Ranryu692> You've basically won already, Pat
[1:59:54] <Pookiedaexzile> But what if no telegraph
[2:00:04] <ExpressNode> I know they aren't dead in a literal sense I meant figuratively
[2:00:12] <vile_brand> im seeing action button in my recommendations?
[2:00:24] <bleugh> the no mixup mixup
[2:00:35] <%Bluwizard21> its memorizing 1 pattern that takes forever to learn
[2:00:39] <xhodocto385> this is one really hard game, not s bad as IWBTG
[2:00:41] <Jimsehy> LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, HEAD SMASH
[2:00:49] <brachydios777> won already huh?
[2:00:50] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> the music is this game is better than the entire game.
[2:00:55] <BakaTyler> wait is this the default difficulty? I haven't played this in years. I could've sworn there were checkpoints
[2:00:56] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> in*
[2:00:58] <Profmcstevie> It's a break for speedrunners cos this cannot be sped up
[2:01:06] <vile_brand> i wanna be the boshy is harder than this
[2:01:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Pattern bosses can be fine if they're engaging for their scripted actions and it's a victory lap so you only see it ONCE. Seeing the same loop a dozen times kills that impact.
[2:01:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> this is infuriating
[2:01:26] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:34] <xhodocto385> every boss is easy, NOT this
[2:01:46] <mr_saturday93> the roars and rock smashing really add to the music
[2:01:47] <%TerpanderLux> 😡
[2:01:56] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> this boss looks tedious
[2:02:01] <xhodocto385> be glad this game has no bullet hell but would you like one?
[2:02:10] <Profmcstevie> You don't even get to hit him or anything
[2:02:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Augh
[2:02:11] <SaltyAzteca> HOLD PAT

[2:08:03] <%GabeSweetMan> @donkeypunch720 LUL
[2:08:12] <%Dakuu75> Paige looks in a mirror: "I can kick my ass. I got nuthin on me."
[2:08:34] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[2:08:37] <%captain_thickthighs> so "she fell down some stairs" your gonna have to expolain to an emt some day
[2:08:38] <xhodocto385> why do meat boy's fleshy sounds make me hungry, it sounds like someone squishing chicken carcasses
[2:08:54] <heartlesshealer> oh dang
[2:08:58] <Profmcstevie> Only 2 things ever bothered me about Meat Boy: Spawning off the ground and auto wall cling
[2:08:59] <%Dakuu75> you'll have other chances to see it. I'm sure, Pat.
[2:09:01] <@Ranryu692> you told Woolie about a second time she walked into glass on the podcast
[2:09:02] <+emperri> it's all over but the crying
[2:09:04] <akitanito> siren
[2:09:05] <%TerpanderLux> thats a klaxon
[2:09:18] <+Catpurnicus> wee woo wee woo
[2:09:18] <%GabeSweetMan> @Dakuu75 "Day Paige smacks into a mirror to become Night Paige."
[2:09:23] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> paiges cry starts up like an ambulance siren?
[2:09:24] <@Ranryu692> Summer or Fall 2020
[2:09:29] <%StephanieSadGirl> If they ever do a new Silent Hill game, Paige should audition to be the siren
[2:09:33] <@Ranryu692> I just listened to the podcast a few weeks ago
[2:09:34] <heartlesshealer> maybe that glass wasn't a door
[2:09:36] <DrStinkers> is paige a bird
[2:09:39] <IvanMistwalker> Paige is the only person that can kick her own ass accidentally
[2:09:41] <%MegadBlitz> paige sees her shadow and challenges it
[2:09:42] <devanmuse> @Dakuu75 ***ht Paide
[2:09:49] <@Ranryu692> and Woolie exclaimed "Again?!?!?"
[2:09:54] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @stephaniesadgirl that would terrifying
[2:10:02] <xhodocto385> are those antennae?
[2:10:09] <heartlesshealer> wait, then when did paige eat glass if it wasn't when she walked into something?
[2:10:09] <brachydios777> Its like that bit in that last season of Curb Your Enthusiasim
[2:10:14] <%StarOtter70> It was either this level or the one after it that I never beat as a kid
[2:10:19] <Razeino> Maybe the glass is the doors we made on the way.
[2:10:25] <Ell1ot> did Paige eat glass or am i missremembering?
[2:10:37] <rcand9> there was a second time paige ATE glass right?
[2:10:38] <devanmuse> @Ell1ot No, she did
[2:10:43] <xhodocto385> kids playing meat boy?, never got bothered by the blood PogChamp
[2:10:45] <%StarOtter70> As a treat
[2:10:45] <heartlesshealer> Paige, you have too many glass stories
[2:10:50] <%psidefx> A little as a treat
[2:10:51] <slipdog> He's going for Buscemi!
[2:10:52] <%pokefan9956> as a treat
[2:10:59] <Profmcstevie> Just enough for her vitamins
[2:11:03] <heartlesshealer> Baby feed Buschelmo
[2:11:06] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> Paige is the galss box
[2:11:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The healthy amount of glass
[2:11:12] <%Dakuu75> just a little bit... to build the tolerance up... to glass...
[2:11:13] <DrStinkers> we call that the extra hurty sand
[2:11:13] <$CokeMilkRequiem> CokeMilkRequiem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! thanks for keeping me entertained while im sick, dont worry im drinking all my fluids like coke milk and
[2:11:14] <+matf8> she ate glass and lived?
[2:11:20] <%GabeSweetMan> It took me a long time to figure out that "hurty sand" referred to granulated sugar and not, in fact, glass.
[2:11:22] <rcand9> glass is fed
[2:11:40] <Shwepie> @xhodocto385 That's because it's BBQ sauce.
[2:11:59] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> BBQ sauce is pretty good
[2:12:05] <+balkonas1> Man I will never forget when Pat told the story of Paige eating that hairy food
[2:12:16] <%pokefan9956> do you think there's an alt universe paige who just drinks barbecue sauce?
[2:12:24] <+emperri> it was you all along OhMyDog
[2:12:33] <%IronOhki> Dogs don't do good at forward thinking.
[2:12:36] <Coystick> These sorta high challenge platformers are a genre I've never gotten into, but enjoy watching. Like fighting games and racers.
[2:12:38] <BakaTyler> that's a shockingly low amount of meatboys

[2:21:21] <$floralkami> also autorun does kinda suck
[2:21:25] <Profmcstevie> Meat Boy Forever is an autorunner so it's not even very meat boy. There's a lot of stalling strategies to wait for stuff too, not all that fun
[2:21:28] <Ipsenscastle> ugh this reminds me of that one horrible room in guacamelee
[2:21:48] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> is deadly premonition 2 worth getting a Nintendo switch for? I loved the first one.

[2:22:22] <%GabeSweetMan> @PoohTrailSnailCooch No... but there's TONS of other great stuff on that system now though.
[2:22:27] <xhodocto385> auto runners HYPERDANSGAME
[2:22:28] <devanmuse> If you're a super fan... Why?
[2:22:28] <%TerpanderLux> i mean, there are other things to play on the switch
[2:22:30] <%RetroCop87> Freedom Planet 2 comes out soon
[2:22:34] <%GabeSweetMan> JUST for DP2 absolutely not.
[2:22:34] <marcomatame> pat is gaming rn
[2:22:48] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> honestly might get it for deadly premonition and metroid dread.
[2:22:49] <%linSP> end is nigh was a good sequel to this game
[2:22:59] <$floralkami> Freedom Planet 1 didn't really do it for me
[2:23:00] <slipdog> timing af
[2:23:01] <%zeroarturia> Wait for a PC Port?
[2:23:09] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> it's surprisingly easy to find switch oleds right now
[2:23:10] <Profmcstevie> Oh lord Freedom Planet 2 got a solid release date? Well we'll see
[2:23:13] <SaltyAzteca> HE IS HERE
[2:23:15] <%YakumoYomi> @RetroCop87 Really? I feel like that game has been in development for a decade at this point.
[2:23:16] <xhodocto385> also, doesn't the key sound effect feel familiar?
[2:23:24] <%Agami23> that is just a langoleir
[2:23:25] <%RetroCop87> leap of faith
[2:23:31] <%TerpanderLux> @xhodocto385 its used in isaac as well
[2:23:31] <$StrawberryPantsu> @zeroarturia Switch Version runs at like 10 fps
[2:23:34] <Profmcstevie> It's just the SMB2 mask
[2:23:53] <Coystick> What sort of meat is he?
[2:23:57] <+trackles_64> is this the blood bourne demake?
[2:23:58] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm pretty sure you can jump from the top
[2:24:00] <xhodocto385> the three note jingle is distinct, heard it in BoI too
[2:24:04] <%StarOtter70> I think 5-19 is the one I couldn't do
[2:24:07] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> yikes 10fps sounds absolutely terrible!
[2:24:09] <slipdog> mind goblin meat
[2:24:11] <%TerpanderLux> youre being harrassed by a spaghetti and meatballs
[2:24:11] <%studleydoorite> could you just jump off the top and land halfway to the key
[2:24:11] <blue8moon> what is that white stuff?
[2:24:13] <kulmoth> @Agami23 no, we do not make langolier references in 2022, how dare you
[2:24:16] <marcomatame> I never liked Super Meat Boy tbh, how does the difficulty compare to Celeste? To be clear I didn't like it because of the controls not because of difficulty.
[2:24:21] <brachydios777> I say meat boy is spam
[2:24:24] <rcand9> does meatboy have the kind of jump you like from a platformer pat?
[2:24:28] <+TopTieramisu> the white is salt
[2:24:29] <placeholder03> @Coystick Boy
[2:24:29] <+YabbaTroll> salt i think
[2:24:33] <+YabbaTroll> or maggots?
[2:24:38] <%zeroarturia> Yeah I remember catching the stream when Pat played it

[2:24:50] <Coystick> Super boy meat
[2:24:52] <mike2hands> DOH!!
[2:24:55] <%RetroCop87> can you get more distance by wall jumping form the top?
[2:24:55] <blue8moon> cause it appears to be moving ebikoaPanik
[2:25:02] <%GabeSweetMan> It's an acquired speed tech unfortunately.

[2:43:54] <akitanito> thanks woolie
[2:43:59] <rcand9> LUL
[2:43:59] <marvel877> So Woolie did a poor job of describing a thing to you again?
[2:44:00] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt for some reason woolie is really awful at describing things to people. im a fan of gungrave and listening to woolie talk about gungrave is hard
[2:44:01] <slipdog> how far you get? first boss?
[2:44:03] <digimonda> it was also basically stolen from that one guy by nicalis
[2:44:04] <%doctordinkus> it's real fuckin good but it aint no super metroid
[2:44:05] <LunarRemix> hahahaha
[2:44:05] <Profmcstevie> LMAO that's a reach
[2:44:06] <Jaysky> It was one of the first ever indies so
[2:44:07] <%pokefan9956> that's fair
[2:44:08] <%Agami23> like didnt he describe the wire in a way to keep you from playing it?
[2:44:09] <%IronOhki> Damn.
[2:44:11] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> neat
[2:44:12] <%thepizzascotsman> time for pooh bears home run
[2:44:13] <%doctordinkus> OK PAT
[2:44:14] <%linSP> woolie... is not the best at hypin...
[2:44:15] <%RetroCop87> they hacked super emtroid to have fusion physics
[2:44:15] <BurdRightsActivist> Thanks woolie.
[2:44:16] <%MisterRockett> You're insane lol
[2:44:18] <+polothegreatest> Isnt stolen ?
[2:44:18] <Cherokia666> So your Pat-ness kicked in
[2:44:23] <marvel877> Super Metroid's movement did not age well.
[2:44:25] <nomnombear64> i like the beep boops
[2:44:26] <$MattyNezz> You really need to stop deciding if you like stuff basedc on other people
[2:44:29] <%StephanieSadGirl> @thepizzascotsman HELL YEAH!
[2:44:33] <%Valdorick> Woolie's recommendations are just Chemicals.
[2:44:33] <%RealThiele> floaty jumps
[2:44:34] <%RetroCop87> Pat, they fixed Super Metroid
[2:44:35] <%SharkMissile> gasp D:
[2:44:36] <%IronOhki> Sonic. One jump. Bad game.
[2:44:39] <slipdog> PogBones PogBones PogBones
[2:44:41] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> it's the reason why u don't like dark souls copies
[2:44:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Does woolie use the overpowered boss characters in Cave Story too?
[2:44:42] <Ipsenscastle> i had the same experience back in the day
[2:44:43] <%greasypete00> axiom verge had other issues tho
[2:44:46] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I*
[2:44:47] <%TerpanderLux> ye
[2:44:49] <%IronOhki> Everything is just chemicals.
[2:44:50] <cherryburnout> rat what ?
[2:44:51] <marvel877> NO, I'd rather play Super Metroid than Axiom Verge.
[2:44:54] <%TerpanderLux> eat rat
[2:44:59] <rcand9> pasta rat champion
[2:45:01] <@MistyMntns> Dont eat Rat
[2:45:04] <whimwhisp> It's allowed. If you don't enjoy the controls of a platformer that's kind of the end of it
[2:45:08] <%SharkMissile> Pat eat Rat, Rat eat choesse
[2:45:10] <Azathotic> Why does chat hate Axiom Verge I thought it was fine???
[2:45:12] <%linSP> pasta jmikeRat2

[2:49:43] <+TIME_PUNCHER> @valdorick cant ban them after theyve been subbed for 7 weeks if they live in texas
[2:49:44] <Profmcstevie> Self employed people set some awful standards for themselves

[2:50:15] <XoftheTITANS> @marvel877 as long you and the household are vaxx'd, you should be fine according to science
[2:50:17] <comicalmond> nailed it
[2:50:29] <+tempestzephyr> And that's when you just watch Avatar live on stream
[2:50:31] <+polothegreatest> Bard but with videogames

[2:51:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Gossip Bitch Pat is on the Story
[2:51:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> bruh how hard is it to not?
[2:51:50] <Profmcstevie> DO tell one guy
[2:51:53] <%linSP> sounds like podcast material
[2:51:54] <%TerpanderLux> phew
[2:51:56] <+matf8> she streamed a bunch of episodes of avatar
[2:51:56] <marvel877> @XoftheTITANS all vaxxed, 2 got the booster, but other 2 are public school going children, so if my dad doesn't get it, they'll probably get it. Thank you Texas.
[2:51:56] <xhodocto385> well, someone mentioned Avatar
[2:51:58] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> baited
[2:52:00] <%Valdorick> If you wake up and go "Today I'm going to stream the thing that got me banned last time" maybe don't stream that day.
[2:52:04] <HarshNerf> reacting to poke reacting to getting banned for reacting
[2:52:06] <+BigNerdSam> wha happun
[2:52:07] <+polothegreatest> life? Nah just a week, i bet
[2:52:10] <%RetroCop87> play a sonic game, relax in the abdness
[2:52:11] <Ell1ot> what's a Poki?
[2:52:12] <ExpressNode> Like did she do it in the past before this recent ban?
[2:52:13] <%sniffy77> I'm happy you can realize when a stream wouldn't be an enjoyable time, and can make the decision to take a break instead of forcing yourself to do something you don't wanna do.
[2:52:14] <%RetroCop87> *badness
[2:52:16] <BattlexQueen> I thought she got banned because of a harrassment raid
[2:52:20] <youngin_______420> Nike are firing people who are unvaxxed
[2:52:27] <%baka_sugoi> she basically started the twitch speed running to get banned and unbanned
[2:52:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Poki got banned for streaming Avatar.
[2:52:34] <+wmeldrum> well... he tries to...
[2:52:36] <LunarRemix> Warframe streamers
[2:52:38] <Profmcstevie> He's at a fraction of his viewerbase now he's off Fortnite
[2:52:44] <XoftheTITANS> @marvel877 home schooling is an option
[2:52:44] <Jaysky> People will always expect you to stream ______
[2:52:47] <Profmcstevie> but still SUPER comfortable
[2:52:50] <akitanito> that sounds like a horrible experience
[2:52:52] <Tracazoid> I feel bad for the Destiny streamers hoping it would be the next Halo
[2:52:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Then she almost got banned again because of accusations of drug use on stream.
[2:52:55] <%RealThiele> become BRAND
[2:52:57] <rcand9> im glad enb managed to escape the hell of fans demanding  nothing but souls games
[2:53:01] <%RetroCop87> Asmongold did that, but it also fostered just the worst group of followers
[2:53:03] <downmagic> it cuts both ways
[2:53:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> And then she almost got banned again because of a hate raid
[2:53:14] <%Agami23> its weird because in my brain thats you for ff14 despite you rarely if ever stream it
[2:53:16] <%thedankestmeeme> he has like 2k when he does anything else
[2:53:16] <afronooch> when fartnite 😡
[2:53:18] <marvel877> @XoftheTITANS cousin's kids, i have no say.
[2:53:19] <%oda_flobunaga> DSP?
[2:53:22] <slipdog> a sub-fraction PogBones
[2:53:22] <dybia> Lot of WoW streamers that were happy to see people still watch them now that they don't want to play WoW
[2:53:24] <%thedankestmeeme> maybe 6k if its a ffa
[2:53:26] <xhodocto385> fortnite is getting tiring
[2:53:30] <Profmcstevie> Never appeal to the kids, they are fickle and tasteless
[2:53:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I liked his Dragon's Crown stuff
[2:53:37] <+Mrbaconator> outside looking in it feels foolish to pidgeon hole yourself like that @PatStaresAt
[2:53:38] <%TerpanderLux> 😡
[2:53:39] <rcand9> yup
[2:53:41] <ExpressNode> Really?
[2:53:42] <youngin_______420> xqc gets 80k viewers, do you think any of those viewers have brain cells ?
[2:53:50] <%RetroCop87> people who enjoy Twitch game streams aren't that socially capable
[2:53:51] <xhodocto385> then there are the GTAV streamers who do nothing but play that same game KEKW
[2:53:51] <XoftheTITANS> @marvel877 that's unfortunate
[2:53:56] <%SharkMissile> Money :Y
[2:53:57] <%Agami23> theres a content creator i know about that is having that problem right now for the game "friday night funkin"
[2:54:01] <slipdog> that how twitch is
[2:54:08] <%dasmause> ENB is cool, im glad hes apparently doing okay
[2:54:08] <Azathotic> @youngin_______420 Exactly 80K brain cells amongst them all Kappa
[2:54:09] <mike2hands> hades
[2:54:10] <downmagic> but money... tho
[2:54:10] <%RetroCop87> Warzone
[2:54:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's a game?
[2:54:15] <xhodocto385> even Sykkuno got affected by the GTAV plague, variety is dead
[2:54:15] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I guess my sub didn't go through
[2:54:16] <%oda_flobunaga> Solitaire?
[2:54:17] <+emperri> DSP is never going to crawl out of the hole of being bad, but he's basically invincible down there
[2:54:28] <+vvitchguy> Just watched Alien again. You like Alien Pat?

[2:59:28] <afronooch> the poll was bait
[2:59:29] <%oda_flobunaga> Horizon is to Ass Creed what Okami is to Zelda

[3:00:23] <%NitronStreams> ???
[3:00:23] <downmagic> oh no
[3:00:23] <%doomunderthestairs> it takes so long to get into it but its fantastic one of the few I've platd
[3:00:24] <+Deekman> I was hoping it was going to be days gone
[3:00:26] <+emperri> featuring Aloy from Genshin Impact
[3:00:32] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> if you've seen it before
[3:00:33] <whimwhisp> tasty tasty birch beer. Store had a bunch of it on sale.

[3:00:38] <%LilyaFatal> Wait, you didn’t specify more streams if option A :(
[3:00:39] <$MrWurmles> Awww...
[3:00:46] <Jaysky> Why don't you guys liked mutated child Aloy?
[3:00:46] <%tank7013> It's a pretty good twist eh?
[3:00:47] <%cooldude69xx> It isnt much of a twist anyway
[3:00:47] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I mean it's still good
[3:00:47] <%doomunderthestairs> so it doesn't matter too much then
[3:00:49] <%YakumoYomi> Are you playing on Steam, or the GOG version?
[3:00:53] <+Whitelunick> the twist is really the only good part
[3:00:54] <Jaysky> The story is kinda shit imo
[3:00:55] <EynoStiles> that one bitch dude makes me so furious
[3:00:58] <%TheAntiNihilist> There’s way more lore than story
[3:00:59] <+the_dogman1> Fun game, but stupid name
[3:01:00] <%JustToWatch> HE'S THE WORST
[3:01:00] <Ell1ot> i thought you play most of your games in borderless window
[3:01:01] <%tank7013> Absolutely fuck that dude
[3:01:03] <%RetroCop87> psaBig octoOOF

[3:01:12] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt HE'S ACTUALLY WORSE THAN HITLER!
[3:01:12] <mr_saturday93> the story is amazing who says it sucks?
[3:01:14] <SomeStrangeBroad> I love  this game
[3:01:16] <%Agami23> i dunno why but this game has always been very uninteresting to me. this title is the first time i've seen gameplay
[3:01:17] <%RealThiele> ye big
[3:01:20] <%doomunderthestairs> fuck it I love my robot dinos
[3:01:21] <%JustToWatch> He's like Hermes without the good intentions
[3:01:22] <%barrakuta371> Fuck that psa1guy
[3:01:22] <+Deekman> This games open world is so ducking boring
[3:01:23] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> well is the name make more sense when you beat the game
[3:01:24] <%oda_flobunaga> Okay
[3:01:24] <Jaysky> I like the name Horizon, I don't care for Zero Dawn
[3:01:30] <Profmcstevie> Well it IS the Killzone people
[3:01:30] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:32] <%MidnightBurst12> same
[3:01:33] <zettig> They really shouldn't put zero in the title of the first game
[3:01:34] <@MistyMntns> NGL I liked this game
[3:01:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah it's one of those
[3:01:34] <EynoStiles> Every fuck his decision is the worst
[3:01:34] <%RetroCop87> Horizon of the Wild
[3:01:43] <%doomunderthestairs> the DLC was fun too
[3:01:46] <Mister_McDerp> is this another mindgoblin game?
[3:01:46] <+chiazam> I find the combat in this game just SUCKS sometimes
[3:01:47] <%Valdorick> I can't wait for Horizon Zero Dawn 2, where we find out he's still alive via cloning
[3:01:51] <Ipsenscastle> i had to come back like a year or two later to finish it
[3:01:52] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> dlc in this game was great
[3:01:56] <%oda_flobunaga> I almost beat it but lost interest right before the final battle
[3:01:58] <nomnombear64> i got bored looking for berries
[3:01:59] <%RealThiele> midgame is a slog
[3:02:00] <Justlaxy> Aloy giant child head is a must see
[3:02:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat with the long polls
[3:02:04] <%twistedj3ster> I wish I could play the sequel :/
[3:02:06] <mike2hands> I'VE NEVER seen anything of this hame
[3:02:07] <RaptureOfTheCarrots> forsenBased
[3:02:08] <akitanito> can't you just end it?
[3:02:09] <$ImExtremelyManly> dlc is a good one
[3:02:10] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:02:10] <+Deekman> Same here. It’s super boring
[3:02:10] <auraoftheearth009> I voted
[3:02:10] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I voted sir
[3:02:11] <DracaenaLeaf> Where's the idc option?
[3:02:12] <+cvp5127> i dont care enough
[3:02:13] <afronooch> I dont see it
[3:02:13] <%RetroCop87> you're not democratic
[3:02:14] <+polothegreatest> Dad of. B O I
[3:02:15] <blue8moon> you can't make me vote!
[3:02:15] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> don't @ me
[3:02:15] <%Valdorick> That IS democratic, Pat
[3:02:16] <%doomunderthestairs> only the ones who care
[3:02:17] <slipdog> ResidentSleeper factor
[3:02:17] <%Fadedblank247> but it is realistic
[3:02:17] <akitanito> abstain vote is a vote
[3:02:18] <%FunkyStreams> the minority always wins
[3:02:18] <%TerpanderLux> i voted i love democracy :)
[3:02:18] <%Valdorick> PEOPLE DON'T VOTE
[3:02:18] <TheQuadrupleS> yes it is
[3:02:18] <zettig> Seems pretty realistic to me
[3:02:18] <%greasypete00> i voted
[3:02:18] <%Evil_Emu147> Majority non-voters, just like America :)
[3:02:19] <+ALazo> it is extremely democratic
[3:02:19] <Jaysky> Most don't care to vote
[3:02:19] <%NitronStreams> I waive my right to vote
[3:02:21] <Tracazoid> Playing XIV
[3:02:22] <Bakefowl> twitch poll don't show for everyone

[3:02:23] <%MidnightBurst12> I voted :)
[3:02:24] <%shurtal> I'm dtrying to level Machinist
[3:02:24] <%linSP> its republican
[3:02:25] <%Pappajimbo> sorry was playing pathfinder
[3:02:26] <$MrWurmles> Well.. that's pretty accurate to American democracy.
[3:02:26] <+vvitchguy> On my TV!!
[3:02:27] <ape_hawk> actually, thats how democracies work
[3:02:28] <Mister_McDerp> VOTING IS FOR LOSERS
[3:02:28] <%blistexthief> Have you seen actual voting participation numbers?
[3:02:28] <fcKurl> im playing planescape
[3:02:30] <HarshNerf> NotLikeThis voting gives me anxiety
[3:02:30] <Jaysky> That's classic america Pat most don't vote
[3:02:31] <%psidefx> psaDab
[3:02:31] <rcand9> i voted but i picked the wrong one
[3:02:31] <%cooldude69xx> This is how we get [bad president]  folks!
[3:02:32] <rosemon5001> sure is in CRoC
[3:02:33] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt totally democratic, depends on your institutional design
[3:02:33] <+demonsamura> i wonder how the ps4 version of forbidden west will run. since im not allowed to buy a ps5
[3:02:33] <+Havictos> @chiazam Really I thought it was too easy. I just ran into groups and beat on things
[3:02:33] <XoftheTITANS> i vote to not vote
[3:02:34] <@MistyMntns> Im Playing Gatcha game
[3:02:34] <+emperri> Just like the good old days after 9/11
[3:02:34] <Shwepie> They're electoral votes, Pat.
[3:02:35] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> You’re lucky 1/3 of us voted
[3:02:36] <@PrefectusCorgi> no vote is the best
[3:02:38] <Podakdrank> stop the steal
[3:02:38] <%whyskeywolfe> A lot of us just have you in in the background while we beat it
[3:02:41] <Ell1ot> Nice
[3:02:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> do I get a sticker Pat?
[3:02:41] <Pookiedaexzile> I don't like either of the canidates
[3:02:41] <@MistyMntns> 69% said Scip. Nice
[3:02:41] <wqorst> wait I didn't get to vote
[3:02:42] <+Deekman> Pat going to become a full time horizon streamer
[3:02:42] <%RealThiele> i love democracy
[3:02:42] <%TerpanderLux> we HATE story 😡
[3:02:44] <Jaysky> Skip the child
[3:02:46] <$ImExtremelyManly> only people that care vote
[3:02:47] <+BigNerdSam> Voting is for [Tier 3 Subs]
[3:02:49] <%thedankestmeeme> democratic would be having like 1k votes
[3:02:49] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt what represents a democracy better than not voting then complaining about the result!
[3:02:49] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> lmao!!!
[3:02:52] <$MrWurmles> People voted too much before pat explained the options I think.
[3:02:52] <%blistexthief> The intro is butt
[3:02:54] <Justlaxy> the voters rigged the election
[3:02:54] <%barrakuta371> at most 50% of the population votes in the US, so I'd say thats normal
[3:02:55] <Psyramics> is this a one off or are you gonna go through the whole thing?
[3:02:55] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> I also voted before potential of playthrough was announced
[3:02:55] <EynoStiles> thank god
[3:02:56] <rosemon5001> you can allways say fuck democracy
[3:02:56] <%doomunderthestairs> perf
[3:03:01] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Do the playthrough
[3:03:01] <TheeRabbi> We're americans and preparing for the 2024 election where our votes won't count anyways
[3:03:02] <+Havictos> KId part is not great
[3:03:04] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> I'm a tier 1 sub..
[3:03:05] <%Kaask> horizon is terrible
[3:03:06] <%doomunderthestairs> and its too longggggggg
[3:03:12] <%twistedj3ster> It's too long and too slow
[3:03:13] <%blistexthief> Because of the children
[3:03:15] <%TerpanderLux> i got so bored during the intro that i had to stop playing.
[3:03:16] <rcand9> is it like the vault in fallout 3?
[3:03:16] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Perf, playthrough starts now. Good job Pat
[3:03:22] <$ImExtremelyManly> intro is too slow anyways
[3:03:22] <%doomunderthestairs> just following the old woman takes foerever and that's right at the end of it
[3:03:24] <+chiazam> The intro is fine?
[3:03:27] <EynoStiles> cauldrons are cool thou
[3:03:29] <Podakdrank> @kaask everyone has an opinion but I think it's a great game
[3:03:29] <+Deekman> The mobile app doesn’t show the poll unless you click the vid
[3:03:32] <mike2hands> can you give us a recap of the intro, i mean like why the story is taking place?
[3:03:32] <@MistyMntns> The Child looks weird!
[3:03:33] <CrimsonGargoyle> it's true they ruin everything
[3:03:36] <rcand9> the worst part of the game in fallout 3 was the intro
[3:03:42] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> Pat go straight to the dlc
[3:03:44] <%oda_flobunaga> Horizon is basically a Ass creed game with a different combat system and a sci-fi coat of paint
[3:03:46] <Jaysky> Once the gameplay picks up it's good. Every time the game tries to tell a story with current plot stuff I dislike it. Future stuff is fine though
[3:03:47] <%GetMendoza> GetMendoza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[3:03:49] <SomeStrangeBroad> I have peanut butter and a juice box
[3:03:51] <%TerpanderLux> no :)
[3:03:59] <%cooldude69xx> Like Dragon ball?
[3:03:59] <$batpick> Daddy rost
[3:04:02] <nomnombear64> Wow graphics
[3:04:03] <%blistexthief> Goku and Vegeta?
[3:04:03] <rosemon5001> name one thing kids have made better Kappa
[3:04:03] <%TerpanderLux> @SomeStrangeBroad chjbBoClap
[3:04:05] <+chiazam> The melee is GOD-AWFUL
[3:04:05] <Druss_M> Oh I see it
[3:04:06] <XoftheTITANS> literally, our vote for the presidency doesn't even matter, why vote?
[3:04:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damnit, when did he switch to HZD?
[3:04:08] <%greasypete00> its actually hilarious how much this looks like assassins creed valhalla
[3:04:09] <Druss_M> Right on the roof
[3:04:09] <%thebeargoesHONK> Z fighting so hard i mistook it for WW3
[3:04:09] <rcand9> wow this looks good
[3:04:10] <%doomunderthestairs> caprisun?
[3:04:16] <+emperri> I was concerned she was doing a racist accent
[3:04:18] <%doomunderthestairs> juicy juice?
[3:04:21] <SomeStrangeBroad> it's fucking tasty
[3:04:21] <%TheAntiNihilist> This is still too much intro
[3:04:23] <+demonsamura> what do you mean Zfighting?
[3:04:23] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt I honestly thought you'd skip the proving too.
[3:04:25] <%twistedj3ster> LUL That name was perfect for that delivery
[3:04:27] <%RetroCop87> HYAA
[3:04:30] <+Havictos> Strong character design
[3:04:33] <$ImExtremelyManly> go take down a t rex robot
[3:04:33] <%oda_flobunaga> The core systems of this are just Ass Creed
[3:04:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Just came back, when did you switch to Horizon?
[3:04:35] <NenaFan101> This the woman certain people hate cuz she didn't wear makeup?
[3:04:36] <yficaptions> haloid?
[3:04:43] <Jaysky> Yep
[3:04:44] <Podakdrank> after proving she still has that scar under her neck
[3:04:45] <SomeStrangeBroad> minute maid
[3:04:46] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah was gonna say we still got the trial stuff to get through
[3:04:48] <+Deekman> I don’t understand. How can she be feminine but also strong. 🤷🏻♂️🤷🏻♂️🤷🏻♂️
[3:04:48] <XoftheTITANS> shes from Genshin right Kappa
[3:04:49] <CrimsonGargoyle> god it's so jank
[3:04:50] <Jaysky> Run and slide
[3:04:51] <+Havictos> melee is great you just beat the shit out of stuff
[3:04:53] <%thebeargoesHONK> Is she from DS3?
[3:04:55] <$SGrim> Souls character
[3:05:01] <Pookiedaexzile> He's gonna say its a souls
[3:05:04] <NenaFan101> "It's not Japanese, so it make my dick go limp"... God, I hate people
[3:05:05] <%oda_flobunaga> and a slingshot
[3:05:06] <EynoStiles> explosive arrows are the shit thou
[3:05:06] <+Havictos> I see that
[3:05:07] <CrimsonGargoyle> THE FUCK IT IS LMAOOOO
[3:05:07] <%cooldude69xx> shocked
[3:05:08] <%NitronStreams> naaaaaah
[3:05:08] <akitanito> what.
[3:05:08] <%tank7013> Makes sense
[3:05:09] <%whyskeywolfe> Why
[3:05:10] <%doomunderthestairs> whuuu
[3:05:10] <mike2hands> really??
[3:05:11] <$SGrim> It's an easy connection to see.
[3:05:11] <$MrWurmles> Didn't know that.
[3:05:13] <afronooch> i could see it
[3:05:14] <Ipsenscastle> it's very MH
[3:05:14] <nuane> word?
[3:05:16] <+emperri> this game takes place in the Genshin Impact Cinematic Universe
[3:05:21] <brachydios777> OH?
[3:05:21] <%linSP> its based?
[3:05:23] <+chiazam> Kinda
[3:05:24] <%oda_flobunaga> MoHun Ass Creed
[3:05:25] <%MidnightBurst12> im not surprised
[3:05:25] <NenaFan101> Like, can't you just appreciate a form of medium without thinking about sex?
[3:05:26] <mike2hands> i legit didn't know that
[3:05:26] <%Valdorick> Prove it - Fight Tegrex
[3:05:27] <nomnombear64> base
[3:05:27] <+omegasis> but where's the rathalos tho
[3:05:27] <$ImExtremelyManly> is that true?
[3:05:27] <CrimsonGargoyle> well they got the monsters right, not the hunting LUL
[3:05:29] <%TheAntiNihilist> Meh not really but sure ok whatever he says
[3:05:33] <rcand9> je suis monte?
[3:05:33] <%tank7013> Wellllllll
[3:05:33] <Jaysky> That explains why I like the robot combat
[3:05:39] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Pat mispronounced Breathe of the Wild
[3:05:41] <+ikantreeed> is that legal?
[3:05:42] <%TerpanderLux> they even collabed with monster hunter
[3:05:43] <$MrWurmles> I think "Inspired by" is the better term to use rather than "based"
[3:05:44] <%RealThiele> make 50 tripwire bombs, stlye on monsters
[3:05:44] <Profmcstevie> He's a bow apologist, I see
[3:05:44] <EynoStiles> @omegasis that later at the end
[3:05:45] <roz_en> and with that, you've sold me
[3:05:45] <nuane> that's the most interesting thing ive heard about this game
[3:05:48] <$SGrim> That tracks
[3:05:48] <Ell1ot> so you can't sharpen your hunting horn in this game?
[3:05:48] <Jaysky> Human combat sucks dick
[3:05:48] <mr_saturday93> made by the guys who made the killzone games
[3:05:52] <whimwhisp> Give her a gunlance and I might be interested.
[3:05:54] <@Ranryu692> you did just now though
[3:05:56] <%CopperTucker> CopperTucker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 29 months is a long time, wow. Here's to many more, and I hope for a good year for all of us. Also pet babies and say hi to Paige for me.
[3:05:59] <$ImExtremelyManly> weird i feel like i have more options in monster hunter
[3:06:00] <NenaFan101> Oh everything ripped off Breath of the Wild
[3:06:00] <mike2hands> broth of the wild :P
[3:06:01] <%doomunderthestairs> huh so if I never played monster hunter would that make me like the archer in monster hunter?
[3:06:01] <%TheAntiNihilist> There sure are a lot of traps in the game for a monster hunter game…
[3:06:01] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> this is nothing like botw
[3:06:02] <%TerpanderLux> but botw invented open world
[3:06:03] <nuane> menancingly
[3:06:05] <+vanareus> and Automata
[3:06:05] <Jaysky> MENACINGLY
[3:06:05] <%cooldude69xx> Im sick of hearing about breath of the wild
[3:06:05] <NenaFan101> Even BOTW ripped off BOTW
[3:06:06] <RaptureOfTheCarrots> 🧍
[3:06:06] <%RealThiele> herbs
[3:06:07] <%barrakuta371> Really? Why not GS or IG?
[3:06:14] <%whyskeywolfe> Breath of the Weath
[3:06:17] <%doomunderthestairs> DADDDDD
[3:06:17] <@Ranryu692> Breath of the Wild stans are so annoying
[3:06:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Max is playing the god of the war
[3:06:18] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> botw invented gaming tho
[3:06:19] <+ikantreeed> botw is the primordial video game, shush up!!!!
[3:06:19] <EynoStiles> the machines are cool too
[3:06:20] <+Ez3z> breathof the wild is the first video game ever made
[3:06:20] <%cooldude69xx> @TerpanderLux And grass too!
[3:06:21] <CrimsonGargoyle> this game tried to be every popular game in the 10 years before it without hitting the mark on a single one
[3:06:22] <Profmcstevie> BOTW has poisoned everyones understanding of open world and trees
[3:06:24] <%blistexthief> You could totally pull it off
[3:06:26] <%NitronStreams> dont you know pat. every single open word game with melee combat is botw
[3:06:27] <%TerpanderLux> psaWhat 🧠
[3:06:31] <EynoStiles> i did heart
[3:06:33] <$SGrim> @pat because you're a smart-ass?
[3:06:34] <rcand9> is that ash?
[3:06:34] <$MrWurmles> "Based" implies that they tried to make Monster Hunter but with subtle differences. I don't think that's what the lead designer meant.
[3:06:35] <auraoftheearth009> I switch between brain and heart
[3:06:35] <+Havictos> people whining that pat even associated this with monhun
[3:06:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Aloy is so ugly
[3:06:35] <%RealThiele> botw invented video games duh
[3:06:37] <+chiazam> Same
[3:06:38] <+Ahuizotll> I feel like everyone just says anygame is based on BotW even when they are very much not
[3:06:38] <Jaysky> Brain/sass option feels most natural to Aloy
[3:06:41] <Ipsenscastle> everything in BotW was done somewhere else first, idk why people keep citing it like the source of these things
[3:06:41] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> I just like the joke BibleThump
[3:06:44] <+ikantreeed> that harcut is stupid
[3:06:45] <+Deekman> No it’s hands down monster Hunter. It’s obvious
[3:06:45] <%doomunderthestairs> just grow your beard out
[3:06:46] <TheeRabbi> I love how BOTW fans genuinely think BOTW was the first shitty open world game with stamina lol
[3:06:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> borrow some of woolie's dreads
[3:06:48] <nuane> @CrimsonGargoyle to be fair, botw did the same thing and it worked out great
[3:06:49] <+emperri> I hate Aloy's goofy cushingoid face
[3:06:52] <NenaFan101> @Profmcstevie It's a nice game, but it seems like if Nintendo does it, it must be praised.  If anyone else does it, it's a rip-off
[3:06:53] <+Havictos> Keigan you're out of your mind
[3:06:53] <%Valdorick> That sounded less brain and more Hawk sarcastic.
[3:06:54] <%blistexthief> Grow out a skullet, you got this
[3:06:55] <%TerpanderLux> then grow some
[3:06:57] <akitanito> just get a wig
[3:06:57] <%TheAntiNihilist> @cooldude69xx True.  Even a Genshin Impact surpassed Botw in a year of updates
[3:06:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> I want a new Killzone game wahhhh
[3:07:00] <$ImExtremelyManly> thats what wigs are for
[3:07:00] <$SGrim> @KeiganOfAstora What fucking universe are you from?
[3:07:03] <Pookiedaexzile> casul Warpaint for the day
[3:07:05] <%cooldude69xx> @Ipsenscastle It didn't even do them the best either
[3:07:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Havictos Just joking lol I don't care really
[3:07:06] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> @keiganofastora really I think she's a good looking ginger soul stealer
[3:07:09] <$chance_h> I didn’t really like the hair, reminds me of a mullet
[3:07:09] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> It’s like saying something is like Skyrim
[3:07:13] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt transplant some from your back
[3:07:15] <Podakdrank> you should get hair implants
[3:07:16] <Gorgs7> all you need is that sick beard
[3:07:19] <%greasypete00> these movements are stiff
[3:07:20] <auraoftheearth009> What about growing out your beard to braid it?
[3:07:21] <+Deekman> Get a wig
[3:07:26] <@Ranryu692> Aloy looks like she has cheekbone implants
[3:07:26] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Also fuck the villagers too
[3:07:33] <+Havictos> no it's from your ass
[3:07:33] <%StephanieSadGirl> I really enjoyed this game, but I hated how it wanted to make everything about its politics and not about robot dinosuars
[3:07:36] <Jaysky> I don't like the face tracking in this entire game cause something always feels off.
[3:07:40] <%W1nterTitan> Ashly Brunch is a good VA
[3:07:42] <%RealThiele> hunt until your are overleveled and can annihilate everything
[3:07:45] <%Valdorick> Pat, would you wear your butt hair on your head?
[3:07:46] <+demonsamura> skyrim is like the dark souls of video games
[3:07:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yo, did Pat play anything between Super Meat Boy and this?
[3:07:59] <%shurtal> you know who's awesome? Lance Reddick
[3:08:00] <%TerpanderLux> yeah
[3:08:03] <Podakdrank> he does you do find out what he did he chased the people down that killed his daughter
[3:08:05] <@Ranryu692> @KeiganOfAstora no, just read donations
[3:08:06] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yes you do
[3:08:06] <Profmcstevie> "bad things"
[3:08:06] <rcand9> all i know about this game is robo dinos
[3:08:07] <slipdog> us like a damn fiddle
[3:08:09] <%RealThiele> meat boy -> donos -> horizon
[3:08:10] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt He said peepee poopoo
[3:08:10] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> your quest is to gain more freckles pat
[3:08:10] <Druss_M> He got Mpreg
[3:08:11] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean he is wearing a Pig skin
[3:08:12] <%oda_flobunaga> you totally do
[3:08:14] <%cooldude69xx> @StephanieSadGirl The best parts of this game are the parts where you just wander around hunting laser dinosaurs
[3:08:15] <Ipsenscastle> there's a prequel novel where he fucks a tree
[3:08:18] <%JustToWatch> no they like tree fucking
[3:08:19] <%Valdorick> Getting deep into the Roussy
[3:08:19] <%Agami23> he got drunk and meatspinned around the village
[3:08:20] <nomnombear64> he drank the last can of monsters
[3:08:22] <mr_saturday93> ya actually do pat.
[3:08:23] <SomeStrangeBroad> they say at the end
[3:08:25] <+chiazam> Oh yeah this outcast shit is Fucking Harsh
[3:08:26] <rcand9> its always mpreg
[3:08:27] <%RealThiele> he got a tree pregnante
[3:08:29] <NenaFan101> @StephanieSadGirl I mean, I knew they expected folks would come in for the robot dinosaurs.
[3:08:32] <%blistexthief> It was totally the tree fucking
[3:08:32] <Jaysky> @StephanieSadGirl Agreed
[3:08:38] <fistynopunches> why so much mpreg?
[3:08:41] <TheeRabbi> He admitted that Kojima sucks
[3:08:43] <Podakdrank> he became a death Seeker that is why he
[3:08:44] <LunarRemix> Oh man I looked up Wolfstride and that character totally says Peepee poopoo just like Woolie said
[3:08:46] <NenaFan101> Karst, I've heard that name used in Golden Sun
[3:08:48] <$batpick> Roast is a badass for a reason.
[3:08:49] <%StephanieSadGirl> @StephanieSadGirl I went around the map, I did every side quest every hunt, basically everything but the story the stopped playing...
[3:08:50] <@Ranryu692> bowcaster
[3:08:50] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> yes yes it does
[3:08:52] <%NitronStreams> it totally does
[3:08:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Boltcaster
[3:08:53] <+emperri> sounds like a guitar
[3:08:54] <%W1nterTitan> Totally does
[3:08:54] <+victhebeard> bowcaster
[3:08:55] <Ipsenscastle> Tryp Casterr
[3:08:55] <%za7az> Bowcaster
[3:08:56] <+Havictos> @fistynopunches because it annoys pat
[3:08:57] <%tank7013> Anything-caster sounds like a star wars
[3:08:57] <Podakdrank> he became Outkast
[3:08:59] <rcand9> yes trip caster could be a han solo
[3:09:00] <Mister_McDerp> bowcaster yeah
[3:09:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> oop bowcaster
[3:09:00] <Jaysky> Just hunting in this game is the best part. Anything not involing fighting the robo dinos is meh
[3:09:01] <TallYoda08> Thats Bowcaster
[3:09:01] <HarshNerf> i want to buy a slingshot coz i'm too dumb to figure out sticks and rubber
[3:09:02] <+ikantreeed> outkast have classic albums tho
[3:09:03] <$chance_h> He talked about bussy and Mpreg in public. He was lucky not to be executed
[3:09:04] <%blistexthief> Wookie bowcaster
[3:09:08] <%cooldude69xx> @StephanieSadGirl I wish they built the games plot around the hunting too
[3:09:09] <%doomunderthestairs> I loved hunting all the dinos and getting to ride em too
[3:09:18] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> it's nice but it definitely have some weird pop in issues
[3:09:21] <%doomunderthestairs> this really makes me wanna go threw it again
[3:09:22] <%tank7013> It looked pretty good on a base ps4 even
[3:09:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is on PC? No PS5 upgrade?
[3:09:23] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[3:09:23] <$MrWurmles> I missed that silent character's quest when I played through this game again. I remembered meeting her the first time around, but couldn't remember why I couldn't find her when I recently started it up on PC.

[3:10:20] <NenaFan101> The only thing the MPAA doesn't want is smoking with violence
[3:10:22] <+Havictos> what?
[3:10:28] <%cooldude69xx> @StephanieSadGirl Its like zombie stories where the walking dead turn into backdrops for other, less cool shit

[3:18:28] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt If people can steal art to make NFT's does that mean that someone could make NFT's of someones NFT? Hopefully driving their stupid scam into a death spiral?
[3:18:31] <%doomunderthestairs> shocker
[3:18:33] <rcand9> did you play the pc version of death stranding at all pat?
[3:18:36] <%StephanieSadGirl> Shoot it in its glowing EYeussy!
[3:18:39] <HarshNerf> @KingKrampus you should be worrying about the krussy
[3:18:58] <%oda_flobunaga> Oculussy
[3:19:02] <EynoStiles> Hit the eye
[3:19:07] <+demonsamura> i played the PC version of death stranding, where is my directors cut?
[3:19:10] <+KingKrampus> I'm not even sure what a krussy is
[3:19:19] <StubbornDeer> When I was in the army N F T meant "non futile terminoirite" which means a bullet that can not fire but can, (we can not say "misfire" it is illegal), so a bullet with impure gunpowder or mixed powders like they have out back
[3:19:29] <%RetroCop87> FLUICE
[3:19:30] <Profmcstevie> Hey this really IS Monster Hunter, the melee options for a bow user SUCK

[3:20:07] <EynoStiles> @doomunderthestairs Eh? like two
[3:20:15] <HarshNerf> @StephanieSadGirl gdolphSendit
[3:20:18] <+KingKrampus> @stubborndeer why is misfire termed illegal?
[3:20:20] <StubbornDeer> But economically NFT stands for non fiscal transaction, which means literally anything we can tax but money
[3:20:20] <SomeStrangeBroad> ass bomb
[3:20:28] <+demonsamura> only like one armor set is worth wearing in this game
[3:20:29] <%RetroCop87> wah

[3:28:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Nanomachines son
[3:28:22] <%JustToWatch> no?
[3:28:23] <Mister_McDerp> no
[3:28:24] <Teyaric> good teeth is normal - bad teeth is modern sugar problem
[3:28:27] <marvel877> No Pat.
[3:28:28] <bigdadindustries> Is Pat older than Toothpaste?
[3:28:28] <+KingKrampus> pat...
[3:28:30] <+demonsamura> ppl say the new skyrim breaks the old skyrim
[3:28:32] <%twistedj3ster> nah, I'm sure you can make it from a plant or somoe shit
[3:28:35] <+FingaLights> Pat
[3:28:39] <$MrWurmles> It's the berries. They not only heal your wounds, but they're GREAT against plaque and tooth decay!
[3:28:39] <%AncelDeLambert> teeth are an always problem, folks
[3:28:44] <Pookiedaexzile> 2012 was dank
[3:28:45] <%cooldude69xx> @demonsamura can confirm
[3:28:46] <+AWr00tBear> How far did Pat play this game last time?
[3:28:50] <rcand9> charcoal toothpaste
[3:28:50] <+demonsamura> uuuuhhhh mint?
[3:28:53] <PizzicatoFive5> man is this the most nothing game ever?
[3:28:53] <%AncelDeLambert> original toothbrushes were stripped twigs, Pat
[3:28:53] <+vaderxyz1970> I mean before tooth brushes there were chewsticks
[3:28:57] <%TerpanderLux> you could never
[3:28:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> toothpaste is just abrasive polish for your teeth
[3:29:00] <$insaneintentionsyo> are ya winnin, dad?
[3:29:01] <Profmcstevie> Pat people brush their teeth with rocks, it works
[3:29:02] <ohno778> mint is a plant
[3:29:05] <+matf8> you can make tons of shit from plants pat
[3:29:05] <%AncelDeLambert> and potash was commonly used as a toothpaste
[3:29:10] <%Pappajimbo> rub your teeth with green stick and salt like medievil times
[3:29:10] <SomeStrangeBroad> people used to die from bad teeth
[3:29:10] <HarshNerf> @Teyaric you can literally find ancient skeletons w/ wooden teeth
[3:29:18] <akitanito> just use cif
[3:29:24] <+KingKrampus> paaaaaaat
[3:29:27] <%blistexthief> Toothpaste is just more liberal lies
[3:29:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> you could make it with sand and mud if you wanted
[3:29:33] <blue8moon> 1980 was 42 years ago
[3:29:36] <%StephanieSadGirl> 80s is still 40 yerars ago..
[3:29:37] <rcand9> my dad used toothpaste in the 60s
[3:29:37] <Mister_McDerp> just like ww1 muskets
[3:29:37] <%oda_flobunaga> Charcoal does it
[3:29:38] <+KingKrampus> You CANNOT be this stupid
[3:29:42] <@ssjklyco> THey did with tabacco
[3:29:46] <Druss_M> They did with charcoal
[3:29:46] <%RetroCop87> they brushed their teeth with a lead and cocaine mix
[3:29:46] <ape_hawk> did pat talk about the troy baker nft shit yet?
[3:29:49] <%cooldude69xx> They did, but no tin england
[3:29:52] <%TerpanderLux> youre right
[3:29:55] <Dova573> pat  people uaed reeds to clean their teeths
[3:29:57] <marvel877> PAAAATUH
[3:30:03] <+FingaLights> @stephaniesadgirl oh god
[3:30:03] <$MrWurmles> According to google, "The first civilization historians have documented using a toothpaste-like mixture to brush their teeth is the Egyptians. It is believed to have been used as early as 5,000 BC, though the first recorded formula dates back to 4 AD."
[3:30:06] <$insaneintentionsyo> great, a hippie
[3:30:07] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt ask Paige, she was alive then right?
[3:30:12] <%cooldude69xx> @RetroCop87 As was the style at the time
[3:30:13] <skyshinecrusader> Its like woolie with the people in medieval times didnt have fun or wash up thing
[3:30:16] <Profmcstevie> "Modern-day tooth brushing as a regular habit became prevalent in Europe from the end of the 17th century."
[3:30:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> We can't because photography wasn't invented until after toothpaste
[3:30:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> People in the 50s had a cigarette and a shot of whiskey for breakfast.
[3:30:25] <+matf8> people back then didn't need to brush their teeth as often becaise they had less sugar in their diet
[3:30:35] <%AncelDeLambert> man I hate this dumb bitch. Good thing you never see her again
[3:30:40] <SomeStrangeBroad> that's kinda interesting
[3:30:44] <Dova573> dont do a woolie and think people had no time for fun before the 1900s
[3:30:48] <Mister_McDerp> what a bitch
[3:30:56] <%TerpanderLux> this is a skyrim-like
[3:31:04] <LunarRemix> Someone probably moded them into Skyrim
[3:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt actually, I should ask: what's the spoiler policy on this game for your stream?
[3:31:07] <%jackelzxaa> did paige voice that old lady?
[3:31:07] <+bunchaghosts> this game is mass effect skyrim
[3:31:09] <rcand9> nords but less racist
[3:31:09] <+demonsamura> so how did she lose it up there if she cant get up there? did she lose it like 20 years ago?
[3:31:10] <ape_hawk> your face is a skyrim, pat
[3:31:17] <%JustToWatch> Pat unmodded skyrims look so much worse
[3:31:17] <%AncelDeLambert> got it
[3:31:18] <%StephanieSadGirl> horizon is the part of the sky, the rim of the sky infact...
[3:31:23] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah and you do play as a Stealth Archer like in Skyrim lol
[3:31:27] <+KingKrampus> pat our first recorded recipe for toothpaste came out like when Jesus was a toddler
[3:31:36] <+JayIRay> i can't believe aloy was actually the great grandaughter of merida brave

[3:31:39] <Pookiedaexzile> The Dinosaurs are Robots
[3:31:40] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt do you want to know what Rost did?
[3:31:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> here's part one of my 50 part twitch chat essay on the plot of Horizon Zero Dawn
[3:31:46] <%NocturneNovember> NocturneNovember subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Guess who got a 3070 Ti and a new motherboard for his first home-built PC in the future? I did, suck it, scalpers!
[3:31:47] <%Agami23> makes me want to play/watch skyrim instead
[3:31:49] <%Pappajimbo> I know society collapsed but dont books of the old world still exsit?
[3:31:49] <MarlooRedd> Darth Vader is Luke's father
[3:31:50] <GarbageNirvana> Pro survival tip, you actually don't want to eat nothing but rabbits, apparently they're super lean and humans have trouble processing the specific proteins in them
[3:31:51] <+vaderxyz1970> There are robot dinosaurs pat spoiler
[3:31:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @JayIRay ohmahgad
[3:31:53] <%twistedj3ster> so it turns out the robots are all the Real Dolls humans built in the future
[3:31:54] <+Pendragon3d> is this first time play through?
[3:31:56] <+FingaLights> Vader is the Robussies father
[3:31:58] <%StephanieSadGirl> I CANT BELIEVE that Aloy was a Skyrim all this time
[3:32:05] <HarshNerf> this game only really picks up after tutorial region imo
[3:32:05] <%oda_flobunaga> Okay
[3:32:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Metro Exodus has a lot of really cool Dualsense trigger & haptic stuff. It's really worth checking it out
[3:32:10] <+bunchaghosts> they are dinobots
[3:32:11] <SomeStrangeBroad> the dinosaurs ate greenness to brush their teeth
[3:32:13] <Profmcstevie> Well you see, the dinosaurs are Gestalts....
[3:32:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Aloy was working for the Dwemer the whole time, holy shit!
[3:32:19] <%StephanieSadGirl> @FingaLights Darth Vadussy, Dark Lord of the Sithussy
[3:32:26] <+StryderStrikesAt> At what point do we stop thinking every village in snowy mountians looks like something from skyrim?
[3:32:38] <%Pappajimbo> oh my god i was wrong it was earth all along
[3:32:38] <Profmcstevie> The T-rex ate his veggies
[3:32:40] <+demonsamura> hit em with your stick
[3:32:40] <Profmcstevie> get owned
[3:32:42] <nuane> the dino bots are made by skynet
[3:32:47] <+KingKrampus> pat it is very likely that Julius Caeser used toothpaste
[3:32:50] <%jackelzxaa> does it bother anyone else that aloy is obviously inspired by that redhead from game of thrones that died in the show before the game even came out?
[3:32:53] <SomeStrangeBroad> and chwe
[3:32:54] <ape_hawk> dinosaurs used streams, or mouth-bidets, for their teeth-cleaning
[3:32:56] <HarshNerf> @StryderStrikesAt when snow falls off the roofs
[3:32:57] <%greasypete00> you know if you mispronounce rabbits hard enough it almost sounds like robots
[3:32:57] <%TerpanderLux> they are losers
[3:32:57] <+Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt Can you believe you were secretly the Nerevarine the entire time?
[3:33:00] <%AncelDeLambert> @StryderStrikesAt I mean, at the point logs and basements stop working
[3:33:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Dinosaurs were all vegans
[3:33:03] <+FingaLights> @stephaniesadgirl LUL
[3:33:03] <+bunchaghosts> Fatty Meat
[3:33:04] <AMDBR9S> yeah cant u die form just eating rabbits
[3:33:05] <Profmcstevie> I assumed
[3:33:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> traps bro
[3:33:08] <Mister_McDerp> but they are delicious
[3:33:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not if you set traps
[3:33:08] <+demonsamura> uuuuhhh traps bro
[3:33:08] <%AncelDeLambert> that's why you use snares
[3:33:10] <+Pendragon3d> use traps pat
[3:33:10] <Profmcstevie> else we would have eaten them
[3:33:12] <ape_hawk> all i know about rabbits is that trix isnt for them
[3:33:13] <+Catpurnicus> rabbits have no fat
[3:33:18] <@Ranryu692> that's why you set traps
[3:33:18] <marvel877> Yeah, dinosaurs brushed their teeth, the dentist had posters documenting their brushing habits.
[3:33:19] <SomeStrangeBroad> and chewed ribbed bones from petsmart
[3:33:19] <rcand9> rabbits are fast af
[3:33:20] <akitanito> that's why you farm them
[3:33:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> kinda
[3:33:21] <+chiazam> Pat I don’t believe you
[3:33:22] <%oda_flobunaga> so they are the celery of animals?
[3:33:22] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[3:33:24] <@ssjklyco> YOu can get some kind of poisoning from eating too many I believe
[3:33:27] <%barrakuta371> You can potentially get protein poisoning too
[3:33:30] <+itslunchie> i think they are easier to trap
[3:33:30] <%MidnightBurst12> a box and a carrot
[3:33:31] <%NotVeryLegendary> and that's why we trap them instead
[3:33:32] <+chiazam> @patstaresat Not if I use rabbit traps
[3:33:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> sticks and string mostly
[3:33:33] <+pth88> Ive got some illustrations to show you about traps pat
[3:33:35] <+Pendragon3d> yea a little stick with ownd string on it you got it
[3:33:36] <%twistedj3ster> @jackelzxaa Nah because she always reminds me of the chick from Brave
[3:33:36] <%Pappajimbo> lean meat. fat is very imprortant
[3:33:39] <+demonsamura> celery sucks
[3:33:41] <%barrakuta371> @ssjklyco Exactly
[3:33:45] <+FingaLights> yes
[3:33:50] <%NotVeryLegendary> makin a snare is actually pretty simple
[3:33:50] <%MooseIsGoose> I don't know man I got one pretty easy while hunting.
[3:33:51] <+KingKrampus> if you eat nothing but rabbit you die from malnutrition
[3:33:53] <akitanito> remember to swing a rabbit to get rid of the guts
[3:33:53] <%oda_flobunaga> To be honest, you can get poisoned by eating too much of anything
[3:33:55] <Profmcstevie> Celery DOES suck, fucking negative calories
[3:33:56] <+bunchaghosts> they were just chillin :(
[3:33:58] <%cooldude69xx> Theres a joke to be made with traps and robussys, but Im no magician
[3:33:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> it is true that you can't survive on a rabbit only diet tho
[3:33:59] <$chance_h> Traps have busses and can be mpreged
[3:34:01] <+Forbidden_Karp> I don't know why the scientists keep making these robots
[3:34:08] <+matf8> rabbit has almost no fat, that's why they're not good
[3:34:12] <+vaderxyz1970> You guys are telling me that the new Lola bunny was more acurate to nature!?
[3:34:16] <@ssjklyco> And white paint
[3:34:19] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cooldude69xx You'd also be a piece of shit if you made it because that shits a slur.
[3:34:24] <Profmcstevie> No think, follow gold
[3:34:27] <+demonsamura> follow it now
[3:34:32] <%cooldude69xx> @Forbidden_Karp It's automated now
[3:34:35] <%jackelzxaa> Is there any chance of Pat maybe doing a Sonic Robo Blast 2 stream someday?
[3:34:39] <acejwilliams> just joined, is this pats first time playing Horizon?
[3:34:42] <rosemon5001> the piss string
[3:34:49] <%TerpanderLux> its a spaghetti
[3:34:50] <+demonsamura> no
[3:34:50] <nuane> thank you uncharted
[3:34:56] <Profmcstevie> Sony thinks you're an imbecile
[3:34:57] <skyshinecrusader> @cooldude69xx lol lmao
[3:34:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> you fool
[3:34:58] <%MooseIsGoose> @matf8 If you cook it in a good stew and with some pork broth or a heavy bone broth its good,
[3:35:05] <SomeStrangeBroad> follow the yellow brick road
[3:35:06] <%cooldude69xx> They did that with uncharted too right?
[3:35:08] <marvel877> I got to pick up this game again. I got it when Sony gave it away for free last year on PSN, but other stuff got in the way.
[3:35:11] <+demonsamura> you gonna watch the uncharted movie?
[3:35:13] <$MrWurmles> Is the yellow piece of string related at all to the golden rope of hope of FF7?\
[3:35:22] <%TerpanderLux> she will have at least 1 fun
[3:35:24] <Pookiedaexzile> One Path everytime, Its Platforming
[3:35:27] <+bunchaghosts> Nathan Drake made this game
[3:35:28] <+demonsamura> but its got that short guy in it
[3:35:28] <Tracazoid> Do you think Paige will like the movement tech?
[3:35:31] <rcand9> holland is a baby man
[3:35:34] <Profmcstevie> She's gonna LOVE zooming and smacking big dinos
[3:35:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> but Tom Holland is a hot boi tho
[3:35:34] <%jackelzxaa> instead of a yellow piece of string they should just use a trail of coins
[3:35:41] <+chiazam> Yet again I’m reminded that this game had to come out around the same time as Breath of the Wild
[3:35:45] <GarbageNirvana> same
[3:35:47] <ape_hawk> the uncharted movie? you mean the games that were already cinematic on their own?
[3:35:51] <Profmcstevie> it's a very Paige energy, it's just the...."other" stuff I expect Paige to dislike
[3:35:57] <%greasypete00> how did she lose them up here she was ancient
[3:35:58] <+demonsamura> is tom holland hot?
[3:36:05] <akitanito> how does she not get rope burn doing that
[3:36:06] <@ssjklyco> Her hands are probably burnt from that rope
[3:36:10] <%StephanieSadGirl> yes
[3:36:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> @demonsamura ye
[3:36:17] <%jackelzxaa> tom holland STILL looks like he's 14 years old
[3:36:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Here cands should be bleeding
[3:36:25] <+demonsamura> he looks like a normal dude to me
[3:36:25] <HarshNerf> i highly recommend tom holland lore, very amusing
[3:36:27] <%oda_flobunaga> @demonsamura he would be if you set him on fire
[3:36:34] <akitanito> cyber rope seems like worse
[3:36:37] <%doomunderthestairs> this makes me want to play a
[3:36:37] <%MidnightBurst12> she just built different
[3:36:39] <skyshinecrusader> @demonsamura good looking but i wouldnt say hot
[3:36:40] <SomeStrangeBroad> I always feel like those grapple moves would dislocate something
[3:36:47] <T_Sasquatch> first time playthrough ?
[3:36:49] <marvel877> soft on skin, tough on rocks
[3:36:50] <%doomunderthestairs> this again so I may as well plat the dlc stuff
[3:36:52] <rcand9> imagine making a movie of a game inspired by another game inspired by a movie
[3:36:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @demonsamura normal dudes are hot, plus hes fuckin cut
[3:36:55] <$MrWurmles> The rope extends from the top not the bottom so the part she holds onto never moves. If that doesn't make sense to you- shutuup!
[3:36:56] <+StryderStrikesAt> honestly i wouldn't be surprised if she can do it cause her hands are callused up
[3:36:59] <%Agami23> dont worry, the cyber rope is greased
[3:37:03] <%Dr_DangerPhD> this woman's hands are probably like leather with all the rock climbing and stuff she toughs
[3:37:05] <marvel877> cyber rope's just ethernet cable
[3:37:05] <%jackelzxaa> imagine this game but you were able to spindash up the hill instead.
[3:37:06] <afronooch> yeah
[3:37:07] <LunarRemix> It's chill
[3:37:08] <rcand9> kinda
[3:37:09] <+wertkill> is it too late for me to say "shooting cyber rope"
[3:37:10] <GarbageNirvana> Tom Holland is Michael Cera if Michael Cera didn't end up turning into a weird rat man
[3:37:10] <@Ranryu692> cyber rope will give you electrical burns
[3:37:11] <%studleydoorite> I'm enjoying it
[3:37:11] <+Thyzoon> I mean...
[3:37:11] <%Kaask> its a boring game to play
[3:37:12] <@ssjklyco> It's peaceful
[3:37:13] <+Thyzoon> Yea...
