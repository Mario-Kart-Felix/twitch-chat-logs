[0:15:43] <%ClutchRoadagain> I'd suggest bombing a corner for maximum gold from the gold walls.
[0:15:43] <%GenericDivi> You can enable the soundtracks to be random in the options so they cycle if you want
[0:15:46] <NJigglypuff> @DirtyGaijin it is a very fun game, but its also incredibly difficult. look up coda runs if you want to see the high-end skill ceiling.
[0:15:47] <cj_art> Virt's rendition of the soundtrack is so good
[0:15:50] <%Jetsfantasy> There's so many covers, and they are all amazing
[0:15:51] <CrimsonFox777> Honestly, people should buy the game just for the soundtracks.

[0:20:37] <+InstiGaitan> get red dragon to attack shopkeeper
[0:20:38] <Saltmeisterr> dragons and bats move every 2 beats @AngriestPat
[0:20:39] <b_ikki> dragons are like the first tricky enemy

[0:20:42] <%spiritofmojave> Pat are you and rhythm ok

[0:21:02] <%GenericDivi> every action you can make is a beat
[0:21:03] <%Ascethetic> every other best for dragons
[0:21:03] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat How does pressing up and down at the same time work on an xb1 pad?
[0:21:04] <Tisaric> every other move eah
[0:21:04] <%crimsonharvest> this is just all pattern, use the training arena
[0:21:04] <$rdark_ksu> half notes pat
[0:21:04] <%hawk_rush> pat and music don't go together lmaooo
[0:21:08] <SunsetJack> This game has a great training area to practice specific enemies or weapons.
[0:21:08] <%Ascethetic> beat*
[0:21:09] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat each line that hits the heart is a beat
[0:21:11] <$Tuskor13> if you dont move during the beat does that affect anything
[0:21:12] <%galaxyswirl> enemies movement is also based on the music
[0:21:13] <gustavozxd> did someone say BACKSTAB
[0:21:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Pat ur hoppingon the beat
[0:21:15] <$eldrich_horror> pat no learn patterns
[0:21:15] <zedravan> enemies attack at different beats

[0:21:18] <b_ikki> like those blue guys
[0:21:18] <reonome> oh god pat doesn't know what a beat is

[0:21:31] <%skizzuto> you know what heartbeats are tho
[0:21:31] <$spardanwarrior> 1 beat = 1 action
[0:21:31] <%spiritofmojave> Half notes compared to full for JAGGERS and bats
[0:21:34] <$D4C_Trice> rhythm even

[0:22:48] <%Typhaeon> That's why there's a drum line, man
[0:22:50] <$Tuskor13> Pat is protected from spirits, he is now fully prepared to begin Woolie's haunting
[0:22:51] <bigbradish> I hear that woolie cant even skate on the beat
[0:22:51] <%TeraMercier> Pat can play Simon Says with the best of em, but couldn't play a recorder irl to save his life
[0:22:52] <Triplicat> I thiiiiiiink there's an option in the settings to show the button but it wouldn't make any sense on PC
[0:22:53] <yourliteraldog> you need to feel the music
[0:22:53] <%GenericDivi> i look forward to pat finding the shrine that makes the rhythm irregular
[0:22:53] <cj_art> ok but you don't FEEL it?
[0:22:56] <Mr_Strut> Pat is basically a zentradi.
[0:22:58] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go!
[0:22:58] <conflict1914> I'm convinced Pat is some sort of evil eldritch monstrosity pretending to be a streamer at this point

[0:23:29] <$cureneckbeard> Has pat been playing this game off-rhythm the entire time? I asumed the stream just had audio lag
[0:23:29] <CrimsonFox777> It's like Dark Souls. Every enemy has a pattern @AngriestPat. Learn them, and you'll be fine.
[0:23:30] <+Tuckerace0324> !Uptime
[0:23:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 25m.
[0:23:37] <extradopeness> It's a wonder to behold

[0:27:32] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat for most enemies, their "attack" is just them trying to move into the space you're occupying. So the enemies can only hurt you when they try to move. The red dragon will shoot fire instead of moving if you're horizontal to him though.

[0:45:56] <%DirtyGaijin> sbfpScared dragon
[0:45:58] <%BioApple> Does all zones mode actually include all the zones from the start or only the ones you've unlocked? And does it include 5?
[0:45:59] <%spiritofmojave> Red jagger don't fuck about
[0:46:00] <+JavaManJoJo> going zone by zone if fine for starting out chat
[0:46:00] <EVOriginal> Been away for a few days...did we flush Vampire?
[0:46:01] <DigbyMayor> He's so bad lol
[0:46:01] <%GenericDivi> you don't get diamonds in all zone runs do you?
[0:46:04] <SunsetJack> Yea, this game is harsh if you do mistakes.
[0:46:06] <PortableBoredom> @AngriestPat Now imagine trying an all new area you've never been to in all zones mode.
[0:46:07] <MoverAndAShaker80> Yeah, this game is surprisingly difficult
[0:46:07] <%Typhaeon> The beat(ing) goes on

[0:47:09] <DracaenaLeaf> that dance
[0:47:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Thinking all zones mode may be the case
[0:47:10] <%BioApple> pay attention to telegraphs boyo
[0:47:10] <b_ikki> yeyeye look at him go
[0:47:13] <+Antoids> for the dragon youre supposed to do like a square dance almost, where you go up, left, right, down, left, right, repeat

[0:47:17] <Saltmeisterr> yamero
[0:47:19] <%spiritofmojave> Rhythm chess, man, that's the best way to look at it
[0:47:19] <SunsetJack> Golems move every 3 beat so you can attack while it isn't moving I think.
[0:47:21] <%AbnormalVoid> apatHoldon
[0:47:22] <+TheSaintJohn> tougher thank sekiro confirmed
[0:47:23] <DigbyMayor> @angriestpat Set your character to Bard. It removes the beat so you can see everything coming.

[0:47:23] <rosemon5001> stage 2 enemys whit stage 0 items
[0:47:25] <ScrapSentinel> 死
[0:47:27] <Zebens> is this game easier with Keyboard and mouse or controller?
[0:47:28] <pimpinahz> moto moto
[0:47:30] <+Antoids> cuz that exploits his charge time
[0:47:30] <Mnightshyamallama> it feels like pat doesn't understand a core mechanic of the game
[0:47:32] <Sitromxe> You should probably do all zones so you can power up.
[0:47:35] <%GenericDivi> @SergeEXE It's been a while since i've had to use diamonds to unlock anything but I thought you needed to buy the items for them to appear at all in runs?
[0:47:35] <%GrayMatterMiner> dude can play sekiro and DS but can't catch telegraphs from pixel style :V

[0:49:37] <%Typhaeon> He'll move in your direction, or approximate it
[0:49:37] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat they can move in any direction, and prefer to attack you
[0:49:39] <sgtlaggy> pat, quick restart pls
[0:49:39] <%nmaten> just count the beats out pat itll make it so much easier
[0:49:39] <%LymanAl> LymanAl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 16 months! Time for this sub to get its learner's permit
[0:49:40] <Superscooter> you move away when they do their tracking attack
[0:49:40] <Kalcom> all of them
[0:49:41] <SwindlerOfProgress> Yeah, he
[0:49:42] <+Phoosy> his next movement AFTER the slump is him moving towards you
[0:49:42] <+MisterMusashi> Of course he's turning to attack you, any enemy tha tisn't on a set path will move toward you woopsADD
[0:49:42] <+TheSaintJohn> I can't believe the golem would turn to attack you :O
[0:49:43] <Zebens> @AngriestPat it's 2 punches then back off and repeat
[0:49:44] <+Antoids> yep
[0:49:45] <%SergeEXE> Yeah
[0:49:45] <%g4mejoy> It doesn't matter what side you're on
[0:49:45] <nerdblase> He drops both arms the beat before he attacks.
[0:49:45] <%spiritofmojave> It's every 4 beats with a pretty wide radius
[0:49:46] <MForan98> yeah
[0:49:48] <%GrayMatterMiner> oh so THAT's where the problem's coming
[0:49:48] <%SergeEXE> NOPE

[0:49:52] <%Prozach3> Nope
[0:49:52] <+linSP> NO
[0:49:52] <%Typhaeon> Only the braindead ones
[0:49:52] <+JavaManJoJo> no
[0:49:53] <SwindlerOfProgress> *He's trying to hit you, yes.
[0:49:53] <zedravan> hell no
[0:49:53] <%NWR_James> No
[0:49:53] <Cymen90> ??????????
[0:49:53] <+Antoids> nope, radius
[0:49:54] <%BioApple> different enemies have different rules
[0:49:55] <%skizzuto> yes but they can choose which direction to go
[0:49:55] <Fujiwara_92> nooe
[0:49:55] <%g4mejoy> 2
[0:49:55] <DigbyMayor> Hell always hit you if your adjacent
[0:49:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> they do, you're moving into the path
[0:49:56] <reonome> no
[0:49:58] <b_ikki> they're different
[0:49:58] <$rdark_ksu> that is incorrect
[0:49:58] <MonocleCoyote> LULW
[0:50:00] <Fujiwara_92> nope
[0:50:01] <%GenericDivi> The enemies attack the same way you do
[0:50:02] <rosemon5001> big mortis on brain
[0:50:04] <sjcodan> Big wrong
[0:50:05] <%AbnormalVoid> some enemies move in whatever direction they want
[0:50:06] <+linSP> only dumb monsters attack straight
[0:50:06] <+yoshkosh20> groovy golem
[0:50:06] <pimpinahz> jamada
[0:50:08] <ExemplarKyle> Golem has a cleave
[0:50:08] <MoverAndAShaker80> No Pat, you take damage when you move into the space that the enemy is moving into at the same time.
[0:50:09] <xmetalicdemonx> I love that there is a pratice mode in this game.
[0:50:10] <DigbyMayor> Hell nope
[0:50:11] <DraxTD> ...oh he sais =P
[0:50:11] <+Antoids> it is a little confusing, i suppose
[0:50:13] <aimlesshealer> That explains everything
[0:50:16] <+Bustamente> He attacks YOU
[0:50:17] <SunsetJack> He attacks the closest to where you are basically.
[0:50:18] <MForan98> only blobs and zombies attack in straight lines
[0:50:18] <sjcodan> ITS CHESS, Ya big dummy
[0:50:19] <Saltmeisterr> oh I see
[0:50:20] <%XzileGaming> dont dodge roll, backstep
[0:50:21] <krymzen5> think of them as chess pieces @AngriestPat
[0:50:21] <Sunditsu> only the slimes and zombies attack in a straight line
[0:50:22] <%Jetsfantasy> They can attack in standard d-pad directions
[0:50:23] <CybertronPrime> It's a Grunch Week miracle.
[0:50:23] <HordeofTribbles> outside of a few enemies. like zombies that only move one direction, all enemies will actively track you
[0:50:23] <damienlunas> Movement = Attack
[0:50:24] <+Antoids> weak enemies telegraph a direction, but this guy tracks
[0:50:24] <FalseProphet115> you can hit him 3 times before he hits adjeisent blocks
[0:50:24] <Superscooter> Dragon also works like this. move towards where you are GOING
[0:50:28] <blackjackskellington> Nope. In cardinal directions, you dead
[0:50:36] <Kalcom> "okay"
[0:50:36] <pimpinahz> uuuuuhhhhh

[0:50:43] <$ESP_ROOT> ok
[0:50:44] <SchroedingersFerret> hey
[0:50:44] <$spardanwarrior> It's not like Into the Breach where enemies lock their attacks in ahead of time.
[0:50:45] <%Jetsfantasy> They move ever 4 movements
[0:50:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ACUA HEYO
[0:50:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I love how the golems dance
[0:50:52] <BoBoCatBurger> @angriestpat just like how you move into themto attack they move into you to attack
[0:50:53] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat most of the attacks are enemies moving themselves into you

[0:50:58] <sjcodan> MINDBREAK
[0:51:02] <%Typhaeon> You gotta count

[0:51:10] <+MisterMusashi> the game moves without you moving
[0:51:11] <Kalcom> ?
[0:51:11] <SchroedingersFerret> How can this be?
[0:51:12] <lloyddboy> THE BEAT GOES ON
[0:51:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ???
[0:51:14] <aimlesshealer> We must teach Pat how to music
[0:51:14] <+LetsGitGud> SeemsGood
[0:51:14] <b_ikki> the game doesnt wait for you lmao
[0:51:14] <$KnivesEve> hello
[0:51:14] <%XzileGaming> its to the BEAT man
[0:51:15] <MForan98> always back off when they wind up unless you can kill with the next hit
[0:51:15] <%Aztec50> enemies dont stop dancing either
[0:51:15] <SunsetJack> Honestly, you should move out and see its pattern before attacking.
[0:51:16] <sjcodan> THE BEAT
[0:51:17] <SwindlerOfProgress> You sure didn't.
[0:51:17] <DigbyMayor> @xmetalicdemonx He slouches his head
[0:51:18] <foreverN2dust> The beat goes on
[0:51:18] <Kalcom> you are not the beat
[0:51:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> Don't be cardinal to him after he crouches
[0:51:19] <%Jetsfantasy> The game moves regardless of you
[0:51:21] <%Prozach3> hello
[0:51:21] <Ion_Laser> Hold On HOLD ON
[0:51:22] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat you didnt move so he smacked you
[0:51:22] <%nmaten> he hits on the same beat @AngriestPat just count the beats and its easy
[0:51:23] <jubejube56> this isn't superhot
[0:51:23] <SchroedingersFerret> hello
[0:51:23] <reonome> the beat still happens if you dont move
[0:51:23] <worldbrand> the beats
[0:51:24] <sir_nack> pat, enemies move independently of you
[0:51:24] <%SaltyDongs> The beat don't stop
[0:51:25] <%AbnormalVoid> You moving doesn't move the beat along, you move TO the beat
[0:51:26] <b_ikki> not turn based
[0:51:26] <+Antoids> the beats hitting the heart indicate turns passing, independently of whether you use that turn or not
[0:51:27] <foreverN2dust> Can't stop the beat
[0:51:28] <Triplicat> game confirmed harder than sekiro
[0:51:31] <+Haarute> The beat doesn't stop if you stop moving Pat.
[0:51:32] <sjcodan> BEATS ARE TURNS, Not your movement
[0:51:33] <xmetalicdemonx> oh thanks
[0:51:34] <krymzen5> the beat ignores weather u move or not
[0:51:37] <Kalcom> don't move for a while
[0:51:37] <+MisterMusashi> @AngriestPat There'sa characterr that lets you move only when you want to

[0:51:41] <pimpinahz> Patron-sama, Nigeru!!!!
[0:51:42] <CrusaderBone> Newly spawned enemies will always move along to the music, so if a golem spawns in on beat three of the song, their first move will be an attack
[0:51:42] <+Antoids> it was
[0:51:44] <$ESP_ROOT> nairoW nairoW nairoW
[0:51:44] <MonocleCoyote> canadian redhead has not rhythm LUL
[0:51:45] <narusao> LUL
[0:51:45] <lloyddboy> spawns
[0:51:45] <NumberTooBig> it was
[0:51:46] <krymzen5> it was
[0:51:47] <+linSP> he Spawned
[0:51:47] <%mostundesired> It's the beat you silly.
[0:51:48] <+TheSaintJohn> when they spawn they get 1 for free
[0:51:49] <reonome> it was
[0:51:50] <HordeofTribbles> they spawn ready to attack
[0:51:51] <$rdark_ksu> get rhythm
[0:51:51] <%spiritofmojave> Beats are the turns, not movement
[0:51:52] <sjcodan> LUL LUL
[0:51:52] <gigakits> golem spawns on 1
[0:51:53] <%Prozach3> he lunges twice out of the coffin but is normal outside of that
[0:51:54] <sir_nack> this game makes a lot more sense if you've played traditional roguelikes, because its a faster version of that system
[0:51:55] <Zebens> Maybe wait for him to move first then attack?
[0:51:55] <DigbyMayor> @angriestpat Set character to Bard. He doesn't have the beat restriction so you can take your time.
[0:51:56] <SunsetJack> Beat of the SONG no?
[0:51:56] <kite1haseo> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:51:58] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat it's on a different spawn, watch for him crouching to start his atack
[0:52:00] <%TheKillerKalamari> if his shoulders move down, hop away
[0:52:01] <+MisterMusashi> tthey always mvoe aafter spawning
[0:52:03] <austinj24> ItsEVERY third beat
[0:52:14] <TheBlankAce> He's moving on universal time
[0:52:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you can't take the heat, get off the dance floor
[0:52:19] <pimpinahz> Nigeru.
[0:52:21] <%enternius> You can also move directly away from the golem and then get back on them the next turn after they jump
[0:52:23] <Innocuous_Goat> Pat, are you okay?
[0:52:24] <pimpinahz> masaka
[0:52:24] <narusao> run away on 4
[0:52:27] <sjcodan> BEATS ARE THE TURNS, NOT YoU
[0:52:28] <lloyddboy> THE BEAT GOES ON
[0:52:28] <%Jetsfantasy> It's every 4th beat, you can get 3 attacks in
[0:52:29] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> yeah universal fourth beat
[0:52:30] <%DedlokPM> @Lionkevinson see the lines at the bottom. Those are song beats. everything and you only can move on the beat. Enemies have different movement patterns/move only after a certain number of beats. Moving into a square that is already occupied is an attack. Golems move on the 4th beat. Each enemy has a tell before they move.
[0:52:31] <+Antoids> just stand still next time he spawns and youll see, he moves independently of your actions
[0:52:34] <sir_nack> this is one of the simplest enemies in the game lol
[0:52:34] <$ESP_ROOT> pat just
[0:52:35] <worldbrand> Beware the time cube
[0:52:35] <reonome> pat look at its sprite
[0:52:36] <+miguelrod777> pat has no rhythm
[0:52:37] <$nademonkey1100> he comes out ready
[0:52:38] <%SaltyDongs> Getting betterrrrrrr
[0:52:39] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat theres this thing called dodging
[0:52:40] <%king_chat_dad> Look at him JAMIN
[0:52:40] <%nmaten> he hits you on 4
[0:52:40] <MForan98> @AngriestPat Every 3rd beat, not YOUR 3rd move
[0:52:40] <narusao> FailFish
[0:52:41] <gigakits> golem always does an action on first beat after spawn?
[0:52:41] <%zalonar> Pat ain't got no rhythm
[0:52:42] <+swagocrates> its 4 not 3 pat
[0:52:42] <+MisterMusashi> Pat needs to unlock the BARD sbfpSetIn
[0:52:42] <b_ikki> look at him dance

[0:52:50] <DraxTD> Shake it Rockey!
[0:52:50] <%mostundesired> Just count NotLikeThis
[0:52:52] <foreverN2dust> you could do this blind if you just follow the beat

[0:52:57] <MonocleCoyote> bald canadian doesn't understand rhythm LUL
[0:52:57] <+Anonylesssss> its based on the beats just the movements you do
[0:52:57] <SchroedingersFerret> Music is stupid, right Pat Kappa
[0:52:58] <DigbyMayor> @mistermusashi Bard is unlocked by default

[0:53:40] <tungstenviper> EVERY 4 BEATS HE MOVES
[0:53:40] <+Antoids> every time the heart beats at the bottom of the screen, thats a turn passing
[0:53:40] <Sunditsu> He immediately moves when he spawns, if that helps

[0:53:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
[0:53:48] <Darren716> The world is based on 4, not the golem
[0:53:50] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@DocMadfox) (warning)
[0:53:51] <%mercado94> rythm
[0:53:52] <Psyramics> In Which Chat Tries To Teach Pat Basic Music Theory
[0:53:52] <krymzen5> he moves on the 4th beat
[0:53:52] <austinj24> The beat
[0:53:53] <fullmetalfail> every heart beat is a turn pat
[0:53:53] <$ESP_ROOT> EVERY GOLEM WILL STRIKE ON THE 4TH bEAT
[0:53:53] <%TheDullaMAN> On the attack, count to 4. On every 4, the golem attacks.
[0:53:53] <Nina96> @AngriestPat he continues off the last 1
[0:53:54] <%ClutchRoadagain> Man, a lack of a rhythm really turns this game into a golf club to the teeth.
[0:53:54] <b_ikki> not from when he spawns
[0:53:54] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Not 4 after it spawns, they move on 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 etc @AngriestPat
[0:53:55] <xmetalicdemonx> Pat's doing way better than when I tried this game.
[0:53:55] <MonocleCoyote> coxDIE coxAGAIN
[0:53:56] <MoverAndAShaker80> The golem stays still for three beats, then moves on the fourth
[0:53:58] <aimlesshealer> Say it out loud.. one two three FOUR one two three FOUR
[0:53:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> eery four beats he attacks
[0:53:59] <+Antoids> the game is a blend of active and wait
[0:53:59] <Antrodox> 1 2 3 then it attacks
[0:53:59] <Tisaric> It's music stuff Pat literally won't know this
[0:54:00] <sjcodan> 12341234
[0:54:01] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat If an enemy attacks on every 4th beat in the song, it's every 4th beat, no matter where you are on the map
[0:54:02] <%zalonar> clap it out
[0:54:03] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat you arent the center of the universe, EVERYTHING follows the beat doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[0:54:05] <+HaunchPaunch> like reading music

[0:54:07] <Tisaric> yes he does
[0:54:07] <%GrayMatterMiner> treat his moves like a bar in sheet music
[0:54:07] <tungstenviper> THE BEAT GOES ON
[0:54:08] <HordeofTribbles> guys. enemies are NOT on a universal count. the golem just spawns ready to beat
[0:54:08] <$rdark_ksu> Pat you literally have ears just listen
[0:54:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> no, the BEAT
[0:54:11] <%GenericDivi> Basic Music Theory with Pat

[0:54:12] <foreverN2dust> no, he does
[0:54:12] <Psyramics> count the beats
[0:54:12] <%XzileGaming> ok STOP moving in on him, when he first spawns cause his spawn isnt his move and youre throwing yourself off
[0:54:13] <MoverAndAShaker80> If you are standing in or moving into the space that he moves into then you take damage.
[0:54:13] <sjcodan> Every 4th BEAT
[0:54:14] <+ItBeNyx> just repeat 1234
[0:54:16] <RealPT1> real music time signatures
[0:54:16] <beigesamurai> Forget the beat. Just look for the tell
[0:54:16] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat Moving is an attack
[0:54:17] <+swagocrates> lmao
[0:54:18] <%mostundesired> But he DOES

[0:54:22] <@Mechz71> HOW MUSIC
[0:54:22] <Psyramics> count the beats count the beats count the beats count the beats
[0:54:23] <upandadam> don't
[0:54:23] <StromkoPenguin> It doesn't matter when the golem respawns. If it spawns on beat 1 it hits beat 4. If it spawns beat 3 it hits beat 4.
[0:54:23] <energywarning> oh no

[0:54:36] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat pat, this game works like nethack. enemies moving IS their attack. if you move to a spot an enemy is trying to move to, they will hit you.
[0:54:36] <beigesamurai> When the shoulders stop moving he is about to strike
[0:54:37] <Tisaric> DO not try to use music terms
[0:54:37] <fullmetalfail> @AngriestPat every time the heart beats thats a turn pat

[0:54:43] <%JGardner88> What is even going on here anyways

[0:54:45] <%GrayMatterMiner> rest rest rest attack
[0:54:45] <KatabolicRage> the turns proceed with or without you, he acts every fourth turn, thats all you need know
[0:54:46] <jubejube56> a note on a staff
[0:54:46] <%Hiro01231> apatHoldon apatWrong
[0:54:47] <gigakits> I think Pat is is doing fine but he keeps getting hit after the golem spawns because it seems to attack on first beat after
[0:54:47] <%Typhaeon> The squiggle is a treble or bass clef
[0:54:47] <+swagocrates> hits 4 of them to the heart he attacks
[0:54:47] <%AncelDeLambert> wow
[0:54:47] <%TeraMercier> Tell Pat how many DDR beats to wait
[0:54:48] <$ESP_ROOT> nairoW
[0:54:48] <+Antoids> for you, moving to the beat is optional, for everything else, it's not
[0:54:48] <%frobeards> oh no...
[0:54:48] <conflict1914> He attacks on every 4th beat of the world itself, regardless of where or when he is or if he's just spawned
[0:54:49] <troxcree> He attacks every 4 beats but he has an attack ready when he comes out of the coffin.
[0:54:49] <+miguelrod777> GIVE UP
[0:54:49] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat This is elementary school stuff

[0:54:51] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat youa re counting every move a golem does. it's every 4 beats, even the new enemy will still move on the 4th beat
[0:54:51] <SweetCuppingCake> are you thinking of a rest?
[0:54:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> every line at the bottom of the screen, IS A BEAT
[0:54:52] <SwindlerOfProgress> Pat, just don't move at all and watch it.
[0:54:52] <%vinnysuperg123> @AngriestPat Get Paige in here now
[0:54:53] <TwinBat> the funny thing is paige could probably grasp this easily
[0:54:53] <HordeofTribbles> just run away from him and watch his movements
[0:54:53] <$spardanwarrior> Every time the heart beats is one turn, the golem attacks on every fourth turn
[0:54:54] <SweetCuppingCake> squiggle?
[0:54:54] <$rdark_ksu> yes the lines with the beats on them. it goes 1234 and then starts again
[0:54:54] <Psyramics> just get Paige to explain it to you cause this is not gonna work!

[0:54:55] <%Tucker0603> 1-2-3-Attack(4)
[0:54:55] <%Jetsfantasy> Every movement is 1 count. At 4 counts, it resets. He moves once every 4 counts, that counts as an attack if you're right next to him
[0:54:55] <%GenericDivi> do you guys really expect him to suddenly be able to grasp music theory as we're all basically screaming the same stuff at him
[0:54:56] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat Stares At Music Theory
[0:54:57] <MoverAndAShaker80> Pat, you take damage when an enemy moves into the same space as you.
[0:54:59] <$cureneckbeard> Go get Paige
[0:54:59] <aimlesshealer> This is the best stream ever oh my god
[0:54:59] <Saltmeisterr> SAY 1234 EVERY BEAT

[0:55:04] <%mercado94> i cant
[0:55:05] <%rytyoung> he will attack on the last beat in the bar, ie count to the 4th beat and that's the best he attacks on
[0:55:06] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat in 4/4 or standard timing, music is divided into bars, each bar has 4 beats
[0:55:06] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> pat he attacks every 4th beat of the ***song***, not every 4th beat hes alive
[0:55:07] <DocMadfox> 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack) 1-2-3-4 (attack)
[0:55:08] <+JackMillerTime> yeah i love singing but i cant read sheet music either
[0:55:08] <%NovraSplice> just count 1, 2, 3, 4 along with the pulse of the music, heartbeat etc
[0:55:08] <+ItBeNyx> just repeat 1234 my dude
[0:55:09] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat have you tried dodging, pat
[0:55:09] <Sitromxe> Every fourth beat pat.
[0:55:09] <TwinBat> PHONE A FRIEND PAT
[0:55:10] <%Aztec50> so if you think of the attack as the first beat, you know in 4 more beats he will attack again
[0:55:12] <$cureneckbeard> PAIGE
[0:55:13] <%TheDullaMAN> The world plays on a loop every 4 beats.
[0:55:14] <%XzileGaming> TIU ES FO

[0:55:15] <sjcodan> 1 2 3 ATK 1 2 3 ATK
[0:55:16] <krymzen5> its super simple
[0:55:16] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You can observe from a distance
[0:55:16] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Not 4 after it spawns, they move on EVERY 4th beat. ie 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 etc @AngriestPat
[0:55:17] <DocMadfox> Call Paige
[0:55:17] <pimpinahz> its about the tempo in music..the time between beats.
[0:55:18] <17sevens> Starting from the very start of the level, there's a count going forever, 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, the golem attack on 4 regardless.
[0:55:19] <aimlesshealer> Paige please help us BibleThump
[0:55:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige we need you
[0:55:21] <$afronooch> Mada Mada
[0:55:21] <TheBlankAce> The enemy is moving with the beats not your movement
[0:55:23] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[0:55:23] <fullmetalfail> every 4 turns he jumps at you
[0:55:23] <%spiritofmojave> Acquire music culture
[0:55:23] <+MostRefinedCalla> Just call Woolie
[0:55:24] <+swagocrates> just count to 4
[0:55:24] <MonocleCoyote> how can 1 man have so little rhythm LUL
[0:55:25] <%ryome> Did everyone forget that Pat hates music?
[0:55:25] <%mostundesired> JUST COUNT
[0:55:27] <%nmaten> @AngriestPat just count 1234, 1234 to the beat
[0:55:27] <krymzen5> count it
[0:55:28] <Kalcom> FEEL
[0:55:28] <Superscooter> all you have to do is swipe three times and move away from it the fourth time
[0:55:28] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat he attacks every fourth beat of the SONG, not every fourth beat of his LIFE
[0:55:29] <lloyddboy> SUMMON PAIGE
[0:55:29] <%mostundesired> IT'S JUST COUNTING
[0:55:29] <tungstenviper> GUYS... HE GETS IT
[0:55:30] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> Ask Paige she can sing
[0:55:30] <lloyddboy> WOO
[0:55:30] <Psyramics> Draw the circle, summon Paige!
[0:55:31] <+Haarute> Do THIS by feel then.
[0:55:31] <+Grayhammatter> just COUNT to 4
[0:55:31] <Nina96> wheres Paige
[0:55:31] <Innocuous_Goat> Paige help
[0:55:32] <+StrawberryPantsu> Geeze @AngriestPat keep this up and you'll melt your 2080 :^)
[0:55:32] <sjcodan> I'd need to be in the same room to actually explain this
[0:55:32] <reonome> pat look at its sprite
[0:55:34] <+yoshkosh20> pat confirmed for no rhythm
[0:55:34] <$cureneckbeard> Paige gives us your energy abipopPANTSU
[0:55:37] <+MisterMusashi> THEY ALL DO THAT
[0:55:38] <Innocuous_Goat> Yes
[0:55:38] <%XzileGaming> PAT
[0:55:39] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat think of it this way: if an enemy attack on every other beat e.g. on every odd beat, then if you are on beat 31 and next the them, they will attack you
[0:55:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> THE BEAT PERSISTS
[0:55:39] <sjcodan> YOU AREN'T THE BEAT Pat
[0:55:40] <gustavozxd> elementary school? music class in elementary school? I didn't have that
[0:55:40] <CrusaderBone> monsters don't care about your movement
[0:55:41] <%TheDullaMAN> Exactly
[0:55:41] <Kalcom> ???
[0:55:41] <%mostundesired> THAT'S THE GAME
[0:55:41] <Innocuous_Goat> Beats are turns
[0:55:41] <NumberTooBig> believe it or not, dodging avoids all damage, try it
[0:55:41] <%Typhaeon> That's correct
[0:55:42] <Tisaric> THE COUNTS STAY GOING
[0:55:42] <Zyczenn> GOD PAT
[0:55:42] <%GrayMatterMiner> it's not YOU moving
[0:55:42] <Ner234> YES
[0:55:42] <+swagocrates> its not to your movement its to the beat
[0:55:42] <+Antoids> your movement doesnt matter
[0:55:42] <%Hiro01231> He doesn't care if you are moving
[0:55:42] <%AbnormalVoid> YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE
[0:55:43] <CrusaderBone> they care about the bar
[0:55:44] <pectusumbra> enemies move to music, not to you
[0:55:44] <MoverAndAShaker80> This is not Superhot
[0:55:44] <+JavaManJoJo> your moves don't matter
[0:55:45] <%g4mejoy> Pat, they move on beats, not your moves
[0:55:45] <%skizzuto> the beat goes on regardless of what you do
[0:55:45] <HordeofTribbles> YOU do not determine if the enemies move
[0:55:45] <Sunditsu> They move to the beat not to your actions
[0:55:45] <Superscooter> all the enemies do that
[0:55:45] <%Hilleltaco> The beat still goes when you don't move
[0:55:45] <troxcree> You not moving doesn't mean there's no beat.
[0:55:45] <%zalonar> IT ON THE BEAT
[0:55:45] <%XzileGaming> he moves to the MUSIC
[0:55:46] <+Haarute> BEAT =/= MOVING
[0:55:46] <$SinisterBroccoli> they m,ove to the beat
[0:55:46] <%GrayMatterMiner> it's the game's count
[0:55:46] <Saltmeisterr> YES'
[0:55:47] <Kalcom> you are not the counter
[0:55:47] <Ner234> EXACTLY
[0:55:47] <%meraud> Pat...
[0:55:47] <krymzen5> because counts go even if u dont move
[0:55:47] <%AbnormalVoid> THE LEVEL STILL MOVES
[0:55:48] <%Tucker0603> YOU AREN'T THE BEAT
[0:55:48] <%TheDullaMAN> The world moves by the beat, you don't.
[0:55:48] <jubejube56> that is because movement is tied to the beat of the music, not your movements
[0:55:48] <%GrayMatterMiner> not yours
[0:55:48] <TheBlankAce> The beats are the counter not you
[0:55:48] <SwindlerOfProgress> YOU don't control the beat.
[0:55:48] <ScrapSentinel> Its in real time, they won't wait for you
[0:55:49] <DocMadfox> HE MOVES with the MUSIC
[0:55:49] <$ESP_ROOT> it doesnt matter if youre moving. they move to the beat nairoW nairoW nairoW
[0:55:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I feel ya, I cannot into music
[0:55:50] <AtlasMcCoy> THIS ISNT SUPER HOT
[0:55:50] <17sevens> It's the beat, not your movement. The thing going towards the heart?
[0:55:50] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat ENEMIES MOVE INDEPENDENTLY OF YOU, THEY MOVE COMPLETELY OF THEIR OWN WILL
[0:55:50] <+ItBeNyx> THATS THE GAME
[0:55:51] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You are not playing Bard, Pat
[0:55:51] <worldbrand> Time advances with the beat, not with you
[0:55:52] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> the song keeps going when you dont move @AngriestPat
[0:55:52] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat The beat system keeps going even when you are not moving
[0:55:52] <Ner234> THATS HOW IT WORKS
[0:55:52] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Comrade_Vladof) (warning)
[0:55:53] <reonome> This isnt superhot!!
[0:55:53] <foreverN2dust> You are not the beat
[0:55:53] <pimpinahz> lol
[0:55:53] <%hawk_rush> every enemy has their own beat
[0:55:54] <%Tucker0603> IT'S THE MUSIC
[0:55:54] <Nina96> @AngriestPat he moves to the song
[0:55:54] <+swagocrates> LUL LUL
[0:55:55] <sjcodan> BEATS ARE TURNS, EVEN IF YOU DONT MoVE
[0:55:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat THE WORLD DOESNT REVOLVE AROUND YOUR SLOW ASS PAT
[0:55:55] <MoverAndAShaker80> The enemies are moving to the beat of the level itself, NOT you
[0:55:55] <%vinnysuperg123> GO TELL PAIGE
[0:55:55] <person181> time moves when you dont'
[0:55:55] <gigakits> It's not bound to YOUR movement.
[0:55:56] <%SergeEXE> NOT SUPER HOT
[0:55:56] <%XzileGaming> he is not moving when you move
[0:55:56] <%maskedriderhero> How can this be
[0:55:56] <%Kareem405> you didnt move on that beat
[0:55:56] <Sitromxe> Every monster moves in sync with the beat pat.
[0:55:56] <%g4mejoy> The beats are the turns, not your moves
[0:55:57] <%lewdskeletor13> THATS THE POINT
[0:55:57] <+MisterMusashi> you aren't the music, the MUSIC IS THE MUSIC sbfpSetIn
[0:55:58] <$cureneckbeard> pat you need the groove
[0:55:58] <Innocuous_Goat> One beat is one turn
[0:55:58] <MForan98> @AngriestPat because you aren't THE beat you're moving ON the beat
[0:55:58] <$rdark_ksu> why would they just stand still if you stand still?
[0:55:58] <%Hilleltaco> The game does not stop when you stop
[0:55:59] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat your movement doesn't count
[0:56:01] <$ESP_ROOT> YES
[0:56:02] <beigesamurai> Forget the beats, you don't do music. Watch for his tell. He drops his shoulders just before the attack
[0:56:02] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Just have Paige play the game
[0:56:02] <%XzileGaming> hes moving on the BEAT
[0:56:02] <austinj24> They move to the beat
[0:56:03] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat They all move. No matter if you move or not...they are enemies. They will approach and attack. They just do their moves first
[0:56:03] <+Spr0cket> its not your move its the music that moves him
[0:56:03] <Kalcom> don't move
[0:56:03] <sir_nack> enemies move on their own, they dont give a shit if you move
[0:56:04] <HordeofTribbles> this game is NOT a puzzle game, this game is a REAL TIME STRATEGY game
[0:56:04] <DigbyMayor> This isn't Super Hot
[0:56:04] <pimpinahz> yes!!
[0:56:04] <%rytyoung> the enemy will still take actions on the beats even if you don't do anything
[0:56:05] <ScrapSentinel> @AngriestPat They won't wait for you its all in real time
[0:56:06] <+Antoids> enemies move to the beat, mandatory. you can break the beat to get an advantage, at cost of your multiplier
[0:56:07] <$SGrim> Oh no, Paige is dead! rooCry
[0:56:07] <krymzen5> ITS ALWAYS BY THE SONG
[0:56:08] <%Prozach3> You are not in control the beat is in control
[0:56:08] <Kalcom> just watch him
[0:56:08] <+HaunchPaunch> Ask Woolie
[0:56:09] <%GrayMatterMiner> @AngriestPat it's not YOUR move, it's the world's beat
[0:56:10] <%AbnormalVoid> NotLikeThis
[0:56:10] <%Jetsfantasy> Not moving acts as holding your turn. Enemies don't stop just because you held your turn
[0:56:12] <BoBoCatBurger> @angriestpat he attacks on the first beat not the fourth so it’s “1”-2-3-4 “1”-2-3-4 the beats of the song are turns not you moving
[0:56:12] <%XzileGaming> EXACTLY
[0:56:14] <pimpinahz> the time between beats
[0:56:15] <$ESP_ROOT> CALL WOOLIE
[0:56:16] <bleugh> big song
[0:56:16] <+PanicSwytch> missre1LittleJay
[0:56:16] <disister1201> Pat they don't move to your movement it's to the music
[0:56:16] <sjcodan> YES
[0:56:16] <17sevens> Literally out loud count to 4 over and over
[0:56:17] <aimlesshealer> I'm gonna pass out
[0:56:17] <%spiritofmojave> So it's not the movement, but the SONG's beat lines going through the heart
[0:56:17] <%Typhaeon> When you stop moving in real life, does everything else around you also stop?
[0:56:17] <%mercado94> you dont control the enemies
[0:56:18] <%ClutchRoadagain> Treat the heart beating at the bottom of the screen like a movement.
[0:56:18] <+MisterMusashi> @AngriestPat There's a certain character that plays the way you're thinking. The game only moves when you move with the Bard.
[0:56:19] <sjcodan> CALL WOOLIE
[0:56:19] <%rytyoung> yes
[0:56:20] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah cuz you SUCK
[0:56:20] <HordeofTribbles> play this game like a real time strategy game
[0:56:20] <%Hiro01231> @AngriestPat You don't control the beat, the lines continue moving even if you stop, this is not super hot
[0:56:21] <%XzileGaming> this isnt LUFIA
[0:56:22] <MonocleCoyote> WOOLIE Pog
[0:56:22] <SunsetJack> Obey the beat
[0:56:23] <tungstenviper> TRY IT
[0:56:24] <Saltmeisterr> the beat affects everyone
[0:56:24] <%AbnormalVoid> the level moves whether you move or not
[0:56:25] <%ClutchRoadagain> And it moves to a rhythm.\
[0:56:25] <+rbakervv> real time game pat, not turn based
[0:56:25] <%GenericDivi> everything in this game moves to the beat of the song not based off of your movements
[0:56:25] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat youre not the center of the universe, pat
[0:56:25] <Sunditsu> If you stay still enemies will still move and attack you
[0:56:26] <TwinBat> CALL EMLO
[0:56:28] <%mostundesired> NotLikeThis sipsipGears NotLikeThis sipsipGears
[0:56:30] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat stand completely still and watch the enemy move around
[0:56:31] <sjcodan> CALL WOOLIE ASSIST
[0:56:32] <%AbnormalVoid> everything is in time with the beat
[0:56:32] <%TheDullaMAN> THe World moves to the beat of the song, not the movement of the player.
[0:56:32] <NumberTooBig> we've been over this
[0:56:32] <%SergeEXE> @XzileGaming Nice pull
[0:56:35] <al0nem0nster> I'm suprised Pat can understand any instructions when so many rush at him at once.
[0:56:38] <gigakits> Your movement doesn't matter, and the golem always moves/attacks after spawn
[0:56:38] <krymzen5> yeees
[0:56:38] <NickHatesSnow> Pat should probably play Bard
[0:56:39] <%Kareem405> if you stop moving in dmc enemies still attack pat
[0:56:40] <%ElenaManetta> BOOGIE
[0:56:43] <%SergeEXE> OH
[0:56:43] <$ESP_ROOT> he also has a visual tell if you didnt notice
[0:56:43] <sjcodan> YES IT IS
[0:56:44] <%GenericDivi> oh dear
[0:56:46] <+Antoids> when he spawns hes on a new beat
[0:56:47] <lloyddboy> HE BORN TO FUCK
[0:56:47] <flyingavocadosofdoom> There's literally a heart beating on the screen
[0:56:48] <SchroedingersFerret> We are all but slaves to the beat.
[0:56:48] <$spardanwarrior> @AngriesPat Take your hands off the controller and see what happens
[0:56:49] <Innocuous_Goat> They move when they spawn
[0:56:49] <%XzileGaming> PAT his spawn isnt his move
[0:56:49] <sjcodan> NO
[0:56:49] <%Typhaeon> It's the first beat after the spawn
[0:56:49] <%Jetsfantasy> New monster
[0:56:50] <%Prozach3> Ignore when he first gets out of the coffin it's different then
[0:56:50] <krymzen5> he moves right after spawning
[0:56:50] <Superscooter> his first move out of the coffin is an attack
[0:56:51] <Saltmeisterr> it attacks when it spawns
[0:56:51] <%GrayMatterMiner> @AngriestPat if the golem's bar is rest rest rest attack, you should A A A move
[0:56:51] <%mostundesired> FUCKING
[0:56:51] <jubejube56> when enemies spawn they immediatly attack
[0:56:52] <+Haarute> He does his move action on spawn.
[0:56:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat if you are rhthymically challenged, the beat before he moves/attacks he lowers his head slightly and seeems to shrink in preperation for the attack on thee next beat....
[0:56:53] <%SergeEXE> They get a move when emerging from the Coffin
[0:56:53] <worldbrand> It's not 4 from when it spawns, it's every 4th beat of the song
[0:56:53] <sjcodan> LARGE WRONG
[0:56:53] <ScrapSentinel> That was the 4th beat of the song
[0:56:53] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat EVERY FOURTH OF THE SONG
[0:56:54] <upandadam> ohhhhh myyyyyyyy godddddddddddd
[0:56:54] <+MisterMusashi> Jebaited
[0:56:54] <+ItBeNyx> It changes when they spawn
[0:56:55] <b_ikki> NOT THE SAME GUY
[0:56:56] <rgm_Jesta> He attacks on spawn, Patto
[0:56:56] <NumberTooBig> it spawns in ready to attack @AngriestPat
[0:56:56] <pimpinahz> LUL LUL LUL
[0:56:57] <$ESP_ROOT> SIX
[0:56:57] <%Hilleltaco> NotLikeThis
[0:56:58] <+bibleianblack> PAT YOU BRAIN GENIOUS
[0:56:58] <narusao> LUL
[0:56:58] <+swagocrates> this is amazing
[0:56:58] <%skizzuto> He attacks on spawn
[0:57:00] <Psyramics> The count restarts when he spawns
[0:57:00] <$ESP_ROOT> HE SAID 6
[0:57:01] <BoneofMalkav> lmao
[0:57:01] <SwindlerOfProgress> Pat... Pat, please...
[0:57:01] <%Hiro01231> @AngriestPat he moves the turn after he spawns
[0:57:01] <%AbnormalVoid> He starts with an attack, then it continues
[0:57:01] <narusao> LMAO
[0:57:02] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis
[0:57:04] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat HE'S BORN TO FUCK
[0:57:04] <%mostundesired> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[0:57:05] <MoverAndAShaker80> @AngriestPat It was different that time because it was a new golem spawn
[0:57:06] <%XzileGaming> just back up and let him SPAWN
[0:57:07] <%Razputin217> HOW DO I MUSIC
[0:57:07] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> THERE IS NO 6
[0:57:08] <AtlasMcCoy> How do you exist
[0:57:08] <+MisterMusashi> They all attack after spawning
[0:57:08] <sjcodan> COUNT THE LINES
[0:57:09] <+rbakervv> stay away when they spawen
[0:57:09] <%ElenaManetta> Look AT HIM BOOGIE
[0:57:10] <+chrishnaw> Pat hurt himself in confusion
[0:57:12] <$KnivesEve> music is good
[0:57:13] <%g4mejoy> He starts at attack, and then takes 4 beats to recharge
[0:57:14] <SunsetJack> I am confused now uh
[0:57:14] <Innocuous_Goat> It is a new spawn, it gets a turn immediately after spawning
[0:57:14] <HordeofTribbles> i RACE this game guys let me explain. enemies are not on a universal timer they are on PERSONAL timers. the golem spawns ready to attack
[0:57:15] <%rytyoung> it's the lines at the bottom going into the heart, they are your beats
[0:57:15] <DigbyMayor> This is so painful LUL
[0:57:16] <cherrycottontail> @AngriestPat Chat is wrong, it's not a global timer. They always move the first beat after the beat they spawn on.
[0:57:16] <+Antoids> just be careful when he spawns
[0:57:17] <%vinnysuperg123> The BIGGEST brain
[0:57:19] <sjcodan> STAND STILL
[0:57:20] <+Haarute> It's a new golem, so it starts the pattern over again.
[0:57:21] <StromkoPenguin> Like 90% of chat isn't seeing or understanding what's happening and calls Pat an idiot anyway. :)
[0:57:22] <sjcodan> AND WATCH
[0:57:23] <TheBlankAce> Just observe the enemy for a while doing nothing
[0:57:24] <reonome> he attacks on spawn chat
[0:57:25] <gigakits> @AngriestPat the golem takes an action after spawn, you have to restart your count
[0:57:30] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat If he spawns on the 3rd beat he will move on the next beat
[0:57:32] <%Sirculbs> Spawn and then immediate attack.
[0:57:33] <%TeraMercier> Damn, that's a fine ass little boogie rockboi is rocking
[0:57:34] <%SergeEXE> That's a side effect of the Coffin Spawners
[0:57:34] <MoverAndAShaker80> You have to observe the current enemies' patterns and adapt to it
[0:57:35] <+linSP> respawning resets that individual golem's attack, all golems attack at their own time
[0:57:36] <aimlesshealer> Doing it!!
[0:57:36] <DocMadfox> @chrishnaw Pat hurt himself in confusion is the name of this stream

[0:57:45] <krymzen5> ... no it really isn'r
[0:57:46] <sjcodan> WELCOME TO MUSIC
[0:57:46] <zedravan> here it is not

[0:57:48] <Psyramics> you're getting it!

[0:57:48] <%Aztec50> him got rhythm
[0:57:49] <Nina96> kinda but it gets easy later
[0:57:49] <Sunditsu> It gets WAY HARDER in levels 3 and 4
[0:57:50] <+TehBeerBaron> @AngriestPat He crouches before every attack, jsut look for that
[0:57:51] <zedravan> in game it will be
[0:57:51] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:57:51] <Ner234> This game IS hard tho
[0:57:52] <+jorgamund> yes, Pat, video games are hard
[0:57:53] <%Spydurman> time for Risk of Rain 2?
[0:57:55] <%JGardner88> @AngriestPat The Golem's get a free move after spawning in after that it goes back to their regular pattern
[0:57:56] <%akingofnoobs> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[0:57:56] <+Antoids> this is the game
[0:57:58] <austinj24> You have no rhythm
[0:58:00] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat if your doodBigBrain isnt adjusting, just react to him scrunch up in his animations
[0:58:00] <sjcodan> Please give up
[0:58:00] <$cureneckbeard> He has a tell
[0:58:00] <pimpinahz> it's all about BPS, Pat
[0:58:01] <narusao> why god why
[0:58:02] <%GoldeNOVA> Fuck Music Kappa
[0:58:03] <cherrycottontail> @AngriestPat Chat is wrong, it's not a global timer. They always move the first beat after the beat they spawn on.
[0:58:03] <DigbyMayor> This is one enemy
[0:58:04] <%spiritofmojave> Rhythm is challenging, I don't blame you man
[0:58:04] <%rytyoung> you nearly got it
[0:58:05] <gigakits> I'm actually getting upset Pat it'
[0:58:06] <%GrayMatterMiner> @AngriestPat you ARE doing it, don't give up!
[0:58:07] <%NovaKnightmare> look at em go
[0:58:07] <Imbetweenjobs_> why isnt there an easy mode
[0:58:07] <krymzen5> if you think this is hard then OH BOY
[0:58:08] <NJigglypuff> i believe in you pat
[0:58:11] <%mostundesired> Alright, but at least now he knows how to count.
[0:58:11] <%vinnysuperg123> Cause he AINT GOT RYTHEEM
[0:58:12] <%XzileGaming> @SergeEXE hes playing it literally like that i swear
[0:58:12] <%spiritofmojave> It gets way worse later
[0:58:12] <DraxTD> Woolie needs to take you to Da Club @AngriestPat
[0:58:13] <BoBoCatBurger> @angriestpat it every 4 beats from his spawn not every fourth level beat
[0:58:14] <%Prozach3> you got this now
[0:58:14] <%akingofnoobs> aint got no rhythm
[0:58:14] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat They Spawn and on the next Beat they immediately attack because they spawn ready to pounce
[0:58:15] <Nina96> @AngriestPat would u like a easy mode?
[0:58:15] <+swagocrates> risk of rain 2 is also a rhythm game
[0:58:17] <DraxTD> get you some RYTHEM
[0:58:17] <+MostRefinedCalla> Man this music is good
[0:58:19] <HordeofTribbles> @Imbetweenjobs_ single zones IS the easy mode
[0:58:20] <+Antoids> now that you understand this fundamental rule you can apply it going forward, no worries
[0:58:20] <axelcezar> "cript of the necrodancer should RESPECT its audience and add a easy mode"
[0:58:22] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat BPM Pat, learn it
[0:58:26] <%bevyrage> @angriestpat use the bard so then you can get the movement and attack patterns down. bard to learn, other characters to style.
[0:58:29] <Plague_bagel> heaven or hell
[0:58:29] <Saltmeisterr> tbh its his first time playing the game
[0:58:34] <+MisterMusashi> sbfpSetIn
[0:58:37] <%GoldeNOVA> @axelcezar That's Bard
[0:58:37] <AtlasMcCoy> I understand now. Pat has no rhythm because he's too short to dance.

[0:59:08] <$ESP_ROOT> no
[0:59:09] <HordeofTribbles> if you dont do music, you need to play this game as a real time strategy game and counting enemy patters
[0:59:09] <ScrapSentinel> Become a daft punk
[0:59:09] <ShepardUA> @AngriestPat if you want to skip a beat, hit a wall
[0:59:09] <narusao> 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. and so on

[0:59:19] <%NovraSplice> where's paige to yell at pat
[0:59:19] <Psyramics> its just the tempo man
[0:59:19] <Zyczenn> just stop

[0:59:20] <+Grayhammatter> nothing
[0:59:21] <CrusaderBone> beats

[0:59:23] <%GrayMatterMiner> nothing, right now
[0:59:23] <%MagickBurritoh> wtf Pat
[0:59:24] <sir_nack> BPM doesnt matter
[0:59:24] <AuksMattin> BEATS
[0:59:24] <+Antoids> count the pumps of the heart
[0:59:25] <zedravan> the beats
[0:59:25] <pimpinahz> seconds
[0:59:25] <$cureneckbeard> BEEP BEEP
[0:59:25] <aimlesshealer> 3
[0:59:25] <Superscooter> @AngriestPat you can calibrate your input latency in the options if you want
[0:59:26] <%Typhaeon> BPM is how fast the song is
[0:59:26] <narusao> FailFish
[0:59:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> BEATS
[0:59:27] <Kalcom> none
[0:59:27] <Innocuous_Goat> It's just the speed of the song. Don't worry about it
[0:59:28] <+FrostedZaibatsu> just count to 4
[0:59:28] <%XzileGaming> the heart shows you the BEATS
[0:59:30] <%spiritofmojave> the lines going through the heart like BPM
[0:59:30] <%rytyoung> that's how fast the song or slow the song is
[0:59:30] <%GrayMatterMiner> dont listen to the peeps bringing it up
[0:59:30] <%nmaten> count the beats up to 4 then repeat
[0:59:30] <%Jetsfantasy> BPM is how fast the song is
[0:59:31] <sir_nack> only count the beats
[0:59:31] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ESP_ROOT) (warning)
[0:59:31] <%Aztec50> the beats
[0:59:32] <%mercado94> i dont understand whats happening?
[0:59:32] <tungstenviper> JUST GO ON TIME
[0:59:33] <%rubbishbinge> !uptime
[0:59:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[0:59:34] <sjcodan> This is the worst its ever been
[0:59:34] <b_ikki> the game runs on beats
[0:59:34] <+swagocrates> count the seconds
[0:59:34] <%Hilleltaco> BPM is probably overcomplicating things
[0:59:36] <Sitromxe> The beats, count the beats.
[0:59:36] <NickHatesSnow> Sing to 4
[0:59:37] <King_Krimzon> Pat, play something else...
[0:59:37] <Kalcom> stop
[0:59:37] <al0nem0nster> stop confusing this poor man
[0:59:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> WHAT
[0:59:38] <@Mechz71> BEATS IN MY HEAD
[0:59:38] <pimpinahz> yes
[0:59:38] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat have you tried playing it like a rhythm game
[0:59:38] <$cureneckbeard> Ask Paige
[0:59:39] <%SergeEXE> 3
[0:59:41] <Sunditsu> oh my god chat please LUL
[0:59:41] <%ElenaManetta> It's a BPS race3
[0:59:42] <CrusaderBone> if the sound isn't making sense, go by the bars at the bottom of the screen
[0:59:42] <HordeofTribbles> BPM and BPS does not matter
[0:59:42] <%nmaten> bpm is just how fast the beats happen
[0:59:43] <%XzileGaming> the heart at the bottom literally shows you
[0:59:44] <sir_nack> just count the beats, dont pay attention to the other shit
[0:59:44] <DocMadfox> Stop telling him music stuff god damn it
[0:59:45] <+rbakervv> the tempo of the song determines timing
[0:59:46] <$ESP_ROOT> THE bEATS. ITS 4/4 1, 2 ,3, 4
[0:59:46] <AuksMattin> no beats per minute, it just determines the speed
[0:59:46] <%ClutchRoadagain> I'm not even super into music theory and this makes me incredibly stressed.
[0:59:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Okay look at the pace at which the bars are moving at the bottom
[0:59:47] <sjcodan> Go ask a human
[0:59:47] <DocMadfox> Just tell him the lines
[0:59:48] <bleugh> bepis per minute
[0:59:48] <+Antoids> personally i count the flashing of the tiles on the floor when i play
[0:59:48] <Antrodox> those... blue lines
[0:59:49] <Caidezes> You're making it worse, chat.
[0:59:49] <Bonbie> Oh god don't listen to chat right now
[0:59:49] <%gazingeye1> Just WATCH THE HEART!
[0:59:49] <emillionghost> go get paige
[0:59:49] <a_mad_dragon> CALL WOOLIE
[0:59:50] <+Shabbon_Kuttah> Beats per measure
[0:59:50] <%Slaardacity> Slaardacity subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! much love
[0:59:51] <%rytyoung> Count out loud to the song 1 2 3 4
[0:59:51] <RealPT1> the heart is you visualization for the BPM
[0:59:52] <%GrayMatterMiner> focus on the beats themselves, dont get too nuts over it
[0:59:53] <pimpinahz> some of these songs have more then one beat per second
[0:59:54] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat the easiest way to think about this is to just keep counting in 4's
[0:59:54] <+megaotter> chat you're just confusing himomg
[0:59:56] <DotMatrixLeviathan> don't worry
[0:59:56] <tungstenviper> LUL
[0:59:57] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[0:59:57] <$afronooch> @AngriestPat Every time a line goes thru the heart is 1 beat
[0:59:59] <reonome> CHAT IS DUMB
[0:59:59] <HordeofTribbles> try playing it like an RTS
[0:59:59] <lizard0tm> LUL
[1:00:00] <krymzen5> oooh goood
[1:00:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> Run on antici[ation fam
[1:00:00] <%Tucker0603> fuuuuuck
[1:00:00] <%Aztec50> Bpm/Bps is just how fast the beat is going
[1:00:01] <+MisterMusashi> gennaLUL
[1:00:01] <%BestTeaMaker> 1 2 3 4 and repeat
[1:00:03] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat The lines are the beats
[1:00:03] <%AllyBeeBoo> everyone is making this way too over complicated
[1:00:03] <DotMatrixLeviathan> just feel the music
[1:00:04] <%CrookedSpiral> oh no
[1:00:04] <sjcodan> GET HELP FROM A REAL HUMAN. Please
[1:00:04] <Saltmeisterr> OOF
[1:00:05] <%ElenaManetta> You should get up and dance a little bit to get in the motion
[1:00:06] <%Spydurman> Have you tried getting good?
[1:00:06] <+Antoids> i too play rhythm games on reaction
[1:00:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> this song is120 bpm
[1:00:06] <$ESP_ROOT> pat, tap your foot to the beat of the song
[1:00:07] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Pat is a fundamentally broken person
[1:00:07] <+linSP> 1 bps means 60 bpm
[1:00:08] <disister1201> oh
[1:00:09] <worldbrand> We're clearly not helping
[1:00:09] <DraxTD> @a_mad_dragon you thikn he'd ACTUALY call Woolie? XD
[1:00:10] <%Tucker0603> pack it up guys
[1:00:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> on reaction wtf
[1:00:11] <%Jetsfantasy> Okay, so treat this as a strategy rhythm game
[1:00:11] <Superscooter> this isn't a rhythm game on reaction, this is a rhythm game on instinct
[1:00:12] <NumberTooBig> thats how this isnt working
[1:00:13] <%spiritofmojave> Chat is silly
[1:00:13] <DigbyMayor> Ducking what
[1:00:14] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat do you not nod your head to music?
[1:00:14] <NJigglypuff> have you played rhythm heaven?
[1:00:15] <Saltmeisterr> this is stuff chat
[1:00:15] <%CrookedSpiral> we're done here
[1:00:16] <%Fadedblank247> all 3 of those games are awesome
[1:00:18] <%GenericDivi> Most of the songs in this game are 4/4 time signature, with 4/4 you count 1,2,3,4 then start back at 1 and keep going in that same rhythm
[1:00:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's 2 bps
[1:00:20] <Nina96> @AngriestPat than u can never play this right than
[1:00:21] <Plague_bagel> that explains alot
[1:00:21] <natebud> Pat to beat this game you must learn to groove
[1:00:21] <%gazingeye1> stare at THE HEART
[1:00:22] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat Try sounding on the song using numbers
[1:00:23] <DotMatrixLeviathan> @AngriestPat just feel the music. that's the best way honestly
[1:00:23] <EVOriginal> Let's do some Dante Must Die in that case. :)
[1:00:24] <%Typhaeon> BPM is only going to confuse things
[1:00:24] <+swagocrates> this is rough
[1:00:25] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat the higher the BPM number the more beats happen in one minute. ie 60 bpm would be 1 beat per second. 120 would be 2 beats per second
[1:00:25] <%bevyrage> @angriestpat just work off of the heartbeat and lines at the bottom of the screen. don't care about the music shit if you don't know it.
[1:00:25] <xmetalicdemonx> Pat your doing fine.
[1:00:26] <%yeknomlive> bust a groove literally is the same concept tho
[1:00:26] <MoverAndAShaker80> You need to get the beat of the song to reaction, but you need to actually observe and react to the enemies
[1:00:27] <%GoldeNOVA> Let's go Risk of Rain 2
[1:00:28] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat if you play them on reaction, then you should react to what you see the enemies doing
[1:00:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> count 1 2 3 4 for each 4 beats
[1:00:31] <aimlesshealer> This is the best character arc yet
[1:00:34] <%hawk_rush> nod your head to the beat
[1:00:34] <foreverN2dust> Someone get Pat a recorder and some sheet music.
[1:00:36] <DotMatrixLeviathan> reaction is good for this game too
[1:00:38] <sjcodan> Please risk some rain
[1:00:41] <+Kavtech> I don't know how to play rhythm games other than on reaction.
[1:00:41] <worldbrand> someone mentioned you dont actually need to pay attention to the bars, the golems just get a free move
[1:00:42] <Animal_Farm4> This is more about memorizing patterns. Each enemy will only move in a certain way. Golem will move on beat 3 or 4 then reset its pattern. I forget it's actual move beat though
[1:00:44] <%CrookedSpiral> nice
[1:00:46] <sjcodan> Why did you think this was a good idea?
[1:00:48] <reonome> @genericdivi pat doesnt fucking know what a time signature is
[1:00:50] <startstoprepeat> i don't think this game's for you, pat. consider writing a bunch of obnoxious articles about it.
[1:00:52] <Superscooter> SourPls
[1:00:55] <pimpinahz> Lol @angriestpat many of these songs are more then 1 bps, just so you should know
[1:00:56] <%GoldeNOVA> YOU'RE DRAGGING
[1:00:57] <aimlesshealer> @startstoprepeat LUL
[1:00:58] <%XzileGaming> Just stare at the heart for 10 seconds, youll get it
[1:01:00] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[1:01:01] <sjcodan> BECAUSE MUSIC
[1:01:02] <Psyramics> speed run nonsense
[1:01:04] <$cureneckbeard> pat 2 3 4
[1:01:04] <HordeofTribbles> all zones has a speedrun timer by default
[1:01:05] <+linSP> its a real run
[1:01:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:01:06] <TheBlankAce> Just like scoring you
[1:01:07] <+megaotter> ignore chat they're overcomplicating things tbh
[1:01:07] <krymzen5> different bpm
[1:01:08] <HordeofTribbles> for the leaderboards
[1:01:13] <+Antoids> a lot of elements of the game help you track beats, like enemy animations, the pumping heart, the life meter, and the checkerboard floor. track any of these to help you keep track of enemy timing
[1:01:15] <sjcodan> Please stop
[1:01:17] <Kalcom> the timing is the music one
[1:01:19] <aimlesshealer> bpm is just how fast the song is, that's all
[1:01:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat OK we're gonna start with a simple exercise: Try nodding your head along to the beat. You may notice that it feels good to do this.
[1:01:24] <%XzileGaming> STARE AT HEART
[1:01:24] <al0nem0nster> he's getting better
[1:01:25] <NickHatesSnow> Does he have the Bard?
[1:01:27] <$ESP_ROOT> MISSED!
[1:01:27] <Kalcom> beats are not a whole second
[1:01:27] <+HaunchPaunch> I feel so bad, like everyone is yelling at Pat about music stuff when he's just trying his best.
[1:01:31] <EVOriginal> Play the tutorial?
[1:01:34] <%Typhaeon> I never thought that this representation of a heartbeat was very effective
[1:01:38] <%Typhaeon> It's one frame
[1:01:38] <$cureneckbeard> tap your pat toes
[1:01:43] <krymzen5> i think he's getting worse chat
[1:01:46] <DotMatrixLeviathan> all zones is easier
[1:01:53] <DotMatrixLeviathan> you get more items
[1:01:53] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Cymen90)
[1:01:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> Have you played with swapping in custom music before? It's like a customized difficulty slider. sipsipDab
[1:01:56] <NumberTooBig> lets not confuse the doodBigBrain with music terms, talk to him in Shlooter terms
[1:01:59] <%Aztec50> just feel the beat in your butt and look at the enemies
[1:02:00] <foreverN2dust> LUL
[1:02:00] <al0nem0nster> it's to sync yourself to the beat
[1:02:03] <lizard0tm> LUL
[1:02:04] <$ESP_ROOT> tap your foot to the beat of the song please
[1:02:04] <HordeofTribbles> @HaunchPaunch thats part of the problem, people are trying to explain the game in music terms when for pat it sounds like it needs to be described in RTS terms and math terms
[1:02:04] <%ElenaManetta> Play with your feet
[1:02:05] <pimpinahz> lol
[1:02:06] <%CrookedSpiral> only moce when you tap
[1:02:06] <tungstenviper> KEEP THE TIMING
[1:02:06] <soraabora> helps you keep a beat
[1:02:08] <Nina96> @AngriestPat helps u keep the beat
[1:02:08] <%gazingeye1> tap your toes TO THE HEART BEAT!
[1:02:09] <%GenericDivi> play the game how you want and you'll learn what you need to
[1:02:12] <Saltmeisterr> u need to feel the beat
[1:02:12] <+MisterMusashi> Tapping your toes is THE FIRST RULE of music tempo.
[1:02:13] <$afronooch> LUL
[1:02:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> ohmyfuckinggodpat....
[1:02:14] <%spiritofmojave> SHOW FEET RHYTHM
[1:02:15] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat Count the heartbeats in increments of 4
[1:02:15] <Soffeli> Show your feet
[1:02:16] <%CrookedSpiral> only move when you tap
[1:02:17] <al0nem0nster> to get your natural rythm atuned to the game so that it'll be easier to keep track of when the enemy moves and attacks.
[1:02:17] <Superscooter> local ginger man does not get it
[1:02:17] <KatabolicRage> just stop giving him musically based advice, he doesn't get it, he works off of visual que's
[1:02:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat it help keeps the beat
[1:02:22] <Saltmeisterr> FEEL THE BEAT'
[1:02:23] <%BestTeaMaker> tap your toe to each beat to help keep yourself in sync with the music
[1:02:25] <+jorgamund> @AngriestPat you need to feel the beat down in your soul
[1:02:25] <%JGardner88> Oh guys just let him figure it out, he is doing good so far
[1:02:25] <%hawk_rush> We need an "I don't understand" emote
[1:02:25] <lizard0tm> I hope he's joking sometimes
[1:02:26] <emillionghost> bob with the music
[1:02:27] <+HaunchPaunch> Tap toes to the heartbeat
[1:02:28] <%akingofnoobs> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[1:02:28] <MoverAndAShaker80> They suggested tapping toes just to help you keep the rhythm.
[1:02:29] <+Grayhammatter> this tempo down though
[1:02:30] <$ESP_ROOT> nairoW
[1:02:33] <%rytyoung> It helps you keep you in time with the song
[1:02:33] <krymzen5> just find a way to keep the rythm of the beats. i say 1 and then 2
[1:02:34] <reonome> I don't think chat understands how fucked up pat is
[1:02:34] <lizard0tm> But I know he's not
[1:02:35] <$afronooch> i cant tell if he's doing a bit or not
[1:02:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> FailFish

[1:02:40] <%frobeards> I don't think Pat's going to suddenly learn how to music guys...
[1:02:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 4m.
[1:02:42] <%Reaped_Psyche> Pat can't music.
[1:02:43] <AuksMattin> ya gotta feel it in your body
[1:02:43] <$ESP_ROOT> patrick boivin

[1:02:44] <Nina96> @AngriestPat of the song
[1:02:44] <+swagocrates> guys this is helping me learn this game though thnx pat for not knowing music <3
[1:02:44] <KatabolicRage> guys just stop, he's better off watching the changing floor tiles
[1:02:45] <al0nem0nster> see the beating heart, everything in the game moves based on a certain number of beats of the heart
[1:02:46] <+InstiGaitan> Hes doing it on purpose
[1:02:48] <DotMatrixLeviathan> just keep calm and feel the music
[1:02:49] <%XzileGaming> is he doing this on purpose
[1:02:50] <TwinBat> NotLikeThis
[1:02:51] <%mostundesired> It means IT HELPS KEEP THE BEAT
[1:02:52] <Novillion> Surely you know at least the concept of beat

[1:03:02] <%CrookedSpiral> this whole game is based on moving and attacking ON BEAT
[1:03:02] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat What kind of game are you playing pat? Why would it be important to keep track of the beat?
[1:03:02] <StaticSunrise> this is the actual worst it has ever been
[1:03:02] <%MagickBurritoh> WHAT DO YOU MEAN
[1:03:03] <emillionghost> tap ur toes with the beat - u will tap automatically and remember the beat
[1:03:03] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Beat your feet to the beat, that way you help focus on it

[1:03:19] <%g4mejoy> Using his toes to keep the beat isn't going to help him if he plays on reaction.
[1:03:19] <AtlasMcCoy> Tap your feet or bob your head when the line hits the heart so your muscle memory will know how long is between each action.
[1:03:19] <al0nem0nster> musicians tap their feet in order to keep tempo, it's sort of a cheat to do it
[1:03:19] <lizard0tm> SHADOW PUUUUUUZZLLLLEEES. but for Pat
[1:03:19] <%XzileGaming> STARE @ HEART for 10 seconds.
[1:03:19] <%Aztec50> I guess if you are going off reaction you can try to go off the floor changing
[1:03:20] <%Typhaeon> What do you mean, what do you mean what do you mean what does that mean?
[1:03:20] <televisedrevolting> It's a rhythm game Pat. You play to the rhythm to get bonuses.

[1:03:28] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat OK ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN BASIC MUSIC: 4/4 follows a pattern of repeating beats. Every four beats, the measure restarts. You can notice because it will usually be a stronger/louder beat then the rest. That is the basics of music.
[1:03:28] <%GrayMatterMiner> oh god im having omikron flashbacks NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:03:29] <Saltmeisterr> peak dumbass
[1:03:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I always thought I would find another rhythmless person but I never thought it would be Pat
[1:03:29] <cgmerryo> or bob your head
[1:03:32] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat Try counting the heartbeats from 1-4 if you wanna get the beat.
[1:03:32] <legoaisu> Ask woolie about tapping toes to keep a beat
[1:03:32] <%Tucker0603> chat i don't think it'll work, Pat's music sense is fundamentally broke
[1:03:33] <Nina96> @AngriestPat ask wooile
[1:03:33] <$ESP_ROOT> GET PAIGE. CALL HEr
[1:03:39] <MoverAndAShaker80> Pat has turned into Matt.
[1:03:40] <$cureneckbeard> Paige will know
[1:03:41] <SunsetJack> Oh man, the whip.
[1:03:42] <beigesamurai> Stop, you're just making him more powerful!
[1:03:43] <$cureneckbeard> Paige is a music
[1:03:44] <%ECRead> we've been bamboozled
[1:03:45] <krymzen5> the music goblins demand it!
[1:03:47] <televisedrevolting> Keep the beat and it'll all be all right.
[1:03:48] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> NO HES NOT
[1:03:49] <%Dr_DangerPhD> apparently the white and ginger debuffs to rhythm stack
[1:03:50] <dmac63> pat's ultra white, of course he doesnt have a rhythm lol
[1:03:50] <MissMalisin> SourPls
[1:03:53] <pimpinahz> Pat, use your foot as the metrodome
[1:03:54] <%TheKillerKalamari> look at the heart beat, it beats with the tempo...
[1:03:54] <%XzileGaming> PAIGE is BLIND, PAT is DEAF
[1:03:55] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat I make music, you're hurting my soul
[1:03:56] <%bevyrage> tap your toe or foot to keep the beat so you don't need to look at the bottom of the screen to move
[1:03:56] <%mostundesired> But you're not even FUCKING COUNTING
[1:03:59] <T_Sasquatch> White men can't jump
[1:03:59] <+Antoids> just use the visual elements, ignore the audio
[1:04:01] <$RaikenTB> You got no rhythm, white boi.
[1:04:01] <+swagocrates> just play how you play guitar hero then it will work
[1:04:02] <+megaotter> when the heart beats at the bottom pat, that's a beat. Enemies attack on certain beats (maybe every other beat,or every 3rd).
[1:04:03] <%spiritofmojave> Call Paige then
[1:04:03] <+Antoids> itll feel good either way
[1:04:04] <Psychoduckk> Woolie would totally understand
[1:04:06] <$ESP_ROOT> let paige play the video game

[1:04:07] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Woolie did just fine playing it
[1:04:07] <TheBlankAce> Someone needs to play the game in front of you probably
[1:04:12] <%XzileGaming> PAIGE is BLIND, PAT is DEAF .
[1:04:13] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat OK ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN BASIC MUSIC TAKE 2: 4/4 follows a pattern of repeating beats. Every four beats, the measure restarts. You can notice because it will usually be a stronger/louder beat then the rest. That is the basics of music.
[1:04:16] <%brickwall35> so is Pat playing a rhythm game without knowing what rhythm is?
[1:04:17] <pimpinahz> @reonome toucher
[1:04:17] <+megaotter> why would counting help him chat if he doesn't understand time signatures?
[1:04:22] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> woolie can dance, hes not going to take your side @AngriestPat
[1:04:23] <+Grayhammatter> lotta good that empty heart container will
[1:04:27] <$KnivesEve> when is the LoZ update?
[1:04:33] <Seitine> Chat he could tap his dick against Paiges ass it won't help him keep the beat some people just aren't like that.

[1:04:58] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> whip fucked you, like whips always do

[1:05:03] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat if you're next to the mole when he pops out, he will attack next turn
[1:05:03] <%Hilleltaco> Whip is weird
[1:05:03] <lizard0tm> LUL / LUL
[1:05:06] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat if you have a sense of rhythm, it means you need no conscious function to keep a beat... so play the game and dont over think it... thinking at all is already a red flag
[1:05:07] <SchroedingersFerret> Just play the lick @AngriestPat

[1:05:22] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat Google 4/4 if you dont understand

[1:05:34] <+GrimmleGrimm> This is fantastic
[1:05:35] <%g4mejoy> Don't worry about the beat, it's not how you're used to playing these games
[1:05:35] <%yeknomlive> i dont blame him for not knowing time sig but it's really funny watching either way
[1:05:35] <+Antoids> just watch the visual elements of the screen move in time with the music and do the same thing
[1:05:35] <+Kavtech> Just fourfour, you know, 4/4/4/4.
[1:05:36] <+Jeikujeiku> its a music thing
[1:05:36] <+HaunchPaunch> Now he's doing it on purpose
[1:05:36] <emillionghost> 4/4 is a time signature. the most common one.
[1:05:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ok look... @AngriestPat doing it based on reaction means you have less "brain ram" to use on focusing on the actual game part... once you F E E L the beat you can se how verything in the games logic is tied to thee beat and you get universee brain
[1:05:37] <Psychoduckk> does pat really not understand what music is?
[1:05:37] <%GrayMatterMiner> that is the amount of notes you have to deal with, that's the speed you're working with
[1:05:37] <KatabolicRage> go with the d&d explanation dude, he doesn't understand musical shite
[1:05:37] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat if you need to play on easy mode so the game doesnt keep going when you stop moving, you can
[1:05:37] <SixthSun2> 4 beats per second
[1:05:38] <lloyddboy> ASK PAIGE
[1:05:38] <$ESP_ROOT> youtube 4/4 time signature on stream please
[1:05:38] <+Grayhammatter> 4Head / 4Head
[1:05:38] <SunsetJack> Man, just let him play..
[1:05:39] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat count 1 2 3 4 repeatedly according to the beat on the bottom of the screen
[1:05:39] <+swagocrates> pat just play it like you play guitar hero reactionary
[1:05:40] <+megaotter> "Just 4/4" i screamed at the person who doesnt understand what time signatures are.
[1:05:40] <al0nem0nster> 4/4 time means one beat per second
[1:05:40] <%mercado94> i dont understand
[1:05:41] <natebud> Try C Groove
[1:05:41] <Zero5897> so the main gimmick to the game is music, sounds pretty interesting to me
[1:05:42] <worldbrand> paige sings, surely she could help a little bit
[1:05:42] <+TheyTookMyBeard> 41236 P+P pat
[1:05:42] <SidBoyTM> @AngriestPat How do you like the music so far..Idk if anyone has asked already so you dont have to answer
[1:05:43] <gigakits> LUL
[1:05:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat OK ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN BASIC MUSIC TAKE 3: 4/4 follows a pattern of repeating beats. Every four beats, the measure restarts. You can notice because it will usually be a stronger/louder beat then the rest. That is the basics of music.
[1:05:43] <Jackalope322> stop giving him time signatures you fucks
[1:05:44] <TheBlankAce> You need to actually talk to someone about music, we can't explain it like this
[1:05:44] <%Nope80808> Just john petrucci it
[1:05:46] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Pat is not interested in understanding best to let it be
[1:05:46] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Start tapping your foot to the beat that is hitting the heart on the screen. This will help your performance
[1:05:46] <pimpinahz> lol I think Pat isnt musically inclined
[1:05:47] <+d00msdaydan> DIG UP STUPID
[1:05:47] <%ElenaManetta> What do you want Patrick
[1:05:48] <%Typhaeon> Seconds is WRONG
[1:05:48] <$cureneckbeard> Ask Paige
[1:05:48] <Darren716> Pat just play the highhats
[1:05:49] <legoaisu> Just go to band camp for that 4/4 knowledge
[1:05:50] <cgmerryo> 4 BEATS TO A BAR MY FREN
[1:05:50] <MonocleCoyote> PAT the NECROFUMBLER
[1:05:50] <%gazingeye1> it means GIT GUD!
[1:05:50] <$valriot> Pat this is your Sekiro moment. i dont think this is for you LUL
[1:05:50] <Superscooter> @AngriestPat have you never played a rhythm game based on how well you knew the music track?
[1:05:51] <Psychoduckk> Good lord
[1:05:52] <foreverN2dust> You need someone you can listen to to teach you.
[1:05:53] <%GrayMatterMiner> base all enemies on a count of 4
[1:05:53] <xmetalicdemonx> Fuck the 4/4 just do you.
[1:05:54] <EVOriginal> @AngriestPat Count the main bass beats to 4, then start over. That's the general beat of the song.
[1:05:54] <$afronooch> this is a bit
[1:05:55] <%Hiro01231> @AngriestPat It's music terminology
[1:05:55] <Kalcom> Just 7 the woop and chicken sanwich the quarter beat
[1:05:55] <+HaunchPaunch> look at him smiling!
[1:05:56] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat just pretend you're maxACTing!!
[1:05:57] <basswizard11> Listen tp the music... and look at when the lines hit the heart
[1:05:57] <Saltmeisterr> CALL PAIGE
[1:06:00] <MrGarettLefebvre> I think they mean to count to 16
[1:06:00] <+TheyTookMyBeard> df 1+@ Pat come on man
[1:06:02] <Novillion> ONE . two . three . four . ONE . two . three . four like that
[1:06:02] <+thenoodle007> there are 4 beats per measure
[1:06:03] <HordeofTribbles> @AngriestPat play this game like an RTS. its basically one just on a strict timer
[1:06:03] <weizamaleza> I like this super confused pat
[1:06:03] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Is Paige available to help?
[1:06:07] <Enz0ned> Dark souls dancer is 3x3
[1:06:08] <SchroedingersFerret> Play the lick Pat
[1:06:08] <damienlunas> Pat, have you ever seen a movie where someone is teaching someone how to dance, and they say like "And one two three four, one two three four" over and over? It's like that.
[1:06:13] <dipstere> 4/4 is 4 beats per second for 4 bars
[1:06:14] <krymzen5> like a combo!!!
[1:06:15] <%Sirculbs> Don't worry Pat. Hornet told you to Git Gud and you Got Gud. Dont listen to evil chat
[1:06:16] <%nmaten> 4 beats per measure, quarter note holds the beat
[1:06:18] <Plague_bagel> turn it into math somehow
[1:06:19] <$eldrich_horror> just gotta feel it pat
[1:06:19] <dipstere> so count it like 1234 in a second
[1:06:22] <DraxTD> @Saltmeisterr I bet even Paige can solve this "puzzle" game =P
[1:06:22] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat The Tempo follows the heartbeat. You can tell when the 4th beat hit's since it normally sounds different. Once you figured out the 4th beat count the heartbeats in groups of 4 to get it down.
[1:06:23] <%ElenaManetta> Bounce your ASS TO THE BEAT
[1:06:23] <foreverN2dust> maybe we should tell pat about 6/8...
[1:06:23] <+thenoodle007> God why don't you get music Pat? Kappa
[1:06:24] <%Typhaeon> I'd like to see him try to wrap his brain around a waltz
[1:06:25] <%ArcanumMBD> Can Pat's foot even reach the floor?
[1:06:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> this seems like a job for paige
[1:06:26] <Innocuous_Goat> Say the numbers out loud
[1:06:26] <energywarning> show bepis
[1:06:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sjcodan)
[1:06:28] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @AngriestPat 4/4 is a time signature . It means that 4th note gets a beat
[1:06:29] <%hawk_rush> TWERK TO THE BEAT
[1:06:29] <pimpinahz> use your foot to tap to the beat, just like a pianist's metrodome
[1:06:30] <MrGarettLefebvre> Soooo Risk of Rain then?
[1:06:30] <%Tucker0603> @AngriestPat tap you foot to the beat of the heart, it'll help guide you for when to attack or move
[1:06:31] <reonome> @AngriestPat everytime the line hits the heart thats a beat
[1:06:31] <televisedrevolting> 4 beats per measure. 4 means the quarter note obly gets one beat.
[1:06:31] <%XzileGaming> PAIGE is BLIND, PAT is DEAF
[1:06:32] <jubejube56> dear god do not make him multitask
[1:06:32] <krymzen5> wat is "tapping"
[1:06:32] <%frobeards> Guys, this isn't going to work...
[1:06:32] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat look at ta 4 4 beat on youtube dude
[1:06:33] <Saltmeisterr> omg
[1:06:34] <narusao> some one buy him a metronome already
[1:06:34] <%anticrust> PAT IS LEARNING
[1:06:35] <$nademonkey1100> cap dat ass to the beat
[1:06:35] <$cureneckbeard> pat feet
[1:06:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Enemy movement is 4 beats.
[1:06:36] <+Snaketsu> JUST FEEL THE BEAT 4Head
[1:06:37] <+linSP> HOLD ON
[1:06:37] <Nina96> cant teach an old dog new tricks chat
[1:06:37] <+MisterMusashi> Every time the heart beats is a count.
[1:06:38] <+lessclams> pat can't do the music good
[1:06:38] <zedravan> "tap" you guys know he can't reach the floor
[1:06:39] <SchroedingersFerret> Clap your ass cheeks to the beat
[1:06:39] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat people are trying to confuse the whole thing with music terms, all you need to know is enemies follow patterns based on the number of beats that pass. example, such and such enemy will attack every 3 beats.
[1:06:39] <+megaotter> how is this going to help him in the game? This is asinine
[1:06:40] <+swagocrates> its working
[1:06:41] <%ElenaManetta> Have Paige twerk to the beat
[1:06:41] <worldbrand> do things ACTUALLY move on the global 4th beat though? because if not, this literally doesnt matter
[1:06:42] <Innocuous_Goat> You can do it
[1:06:43] <+Grayhammatter> big hold on
[1:06:44] <Bamcrash> Tapping your foot or head to the beat will make it easier to keep track of the beat, so you can spend more attention on watching enemies.
[1:06:44] <%anticrust> Give him time he do a bigh think
[1:06:45] <Saltmeisterr> PROGRESS
[1:06:45] <Tisaric> Count 1 2 3 4 for each 4 beats
[1:06:46] <+BubbleyBloos> Man's first encounter with rhythm
[1:06:46] <%hawk_rush> pat needs to look up a quick youtube video god damn
[1:06:46] <emillionghost> one two three FOUR(tap) one two three FOUR(tap)
[1:06:46] <throwaway9989> pat needs 4/20 instead 4/4
[1:06:47] <GreyHeartedHero> Pat, do you know a single thing about music?
[1:06:47] <$ESP_ROOT> 4Head / 4Head
[1:06:48] <%TeraMercier> When your foot hits the floor, that's when you should press your input
[1:06:48] <+Antoids> you can try tapping in time with the heart pumping and then idly maintaining that as a crutch to help you time button presses, true
[1:06:50] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat mute the song and clap in rhythm for a few seconds, for funsies
[1:06:50] <%DedlokPM> Some people are just not musically inclined. I am one. Hell, if I hum a song, it is not based on the instruments. I hum based on the vocals
[1:06:51] <%brickwall35> apatHoldon
[1:06:51] <%Hilleltaco> What have I come in here to, is Pat learning people feelings?
[1:06:51] <Sitromxe> Beat 1 = 1, Beat 2 = 2, Beat 3 - 3, Beat 4 = 4, Beat 5 = 1, Beat 6 = 2, Beat 7 = 3, Beat 8 = 4, and so on.
[1:06:51] <weizamaleza> Just clap your ass checks to the beats duh
[1:06:52] <EVOriginal> I've played DDR for 15 years and I'm hella salty rn lmao
[1:06:53] <%ElenaManetta> Are you laughing or burping
[1:06:53] <%Tucker0603> I BELEIVE IN YOU PAT
[1:06:53] <%Typhaeon> Nobody tell him about 3/4 time
[1:06:54] <TheBlankAce> Actually watch some music tutorials on youtube
[1:06:55] <+megaotter> this literally won't help
[1:06:57] <televisedrevolting> Pat just feel the rhythm and play through it.
[1:06:58] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u look like your in pain
[1:06:58] <soraabora> clap your dummy thicc ass
[1:06:58] <%GrayMatterMiner> it wont
[1:06:59] <%XzileGaming> we're gonna give him an anxiety disorder
[1:07:01] <tungstenviper> LEARN MUSIC LUL
[1:07:01] <person181> BMP is like the thing that high level starcraft players do with their mouse
[1:07:02] <DraxTD> call upon your haritige for rythem pat.... wait are you irish or scottish XD
[1:07:02] <natebud> Hear that big drum sound? It's every four beats @AngriestPat
[1:07:02] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It dosn't havee to be a foot tap, but some sort of rhythymic movement to help you feel it @AngriestPat
[1:07:03] <%FrustratedAF> so how bout that risk of rain? Kappa
[1:07:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> F
[1:07:04] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah just clap your dummy thic ass to the beat
[1:07:05] <TheMeromex> is this your april's fool joke?
[1:07:06] <Dr_Mooose> merchant is killing it though
[1:07:07] <gigakits> I know music sounds good
[1:07:07] <lizard0tm> I think the in game beat is wrong for this song, or twitch is desyncing on me
[1:07:07] <disister1201> do you ever listen to music and find your self tapping or humming along?
[1:07:07] <austinj24> Are we teaching a white man rhythm?
[1:07:07] <televisedrevolting> Goddamit
[1:07:08] <%spiritofmojave> look up a metronome online if you need to, it helps dude! not shaming here
[1:07:08] <SixthSun2> Do you know what music IS?
[1:07:10] <FalseProphet115> USE A METRONOME
[1:07:10] <krymzen5> it should come naturally
[1:07:10] <ScrapSentinel> Risk of Rain time Kappa
[1:07:10] <pimpinahz> hahahahahahahaha
[1:07:11] <%hawk_rush> jesus christ almightly
[1:07:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat might be too white to have rhythym
[1:07:13] <%ElenaManetta> Turn the game's music off apatBlep
[1:07:14] <%rubbishbinge> is this risk of rain 2
[1:07:14] <%Tucker0603> XD
[1:07:14] <%RadicalPirate> oh god. Pat has not rhythm
[1:07:14] <3viltiki> Pat "I don't need to know rhythm to play this game." Also Pat "What the hell is 4/4 time?"
[1:07:15] <Darren716> LUL
[1:07:15] <damienlunas> Pat just repeat out loud "One two three four" every time you press a key.
[1:07:16] <worldbrand> LUL
[1:07:17] <%AllyBeeBoo> Pat you don't need to know anything about music, chat is being dumb
[1:07:17] <%nmaten> listen to the drums or the bass
[1:07:20] <%TeraMercier> And you don't seem to be trying to learn, jackass
[1:07:23] <SweetCuppingCake> @ArcanumMBD lol
[1:07:25] <+thenoodle007> Lot of music experts in chat tonight Kappa
[1:07:25] <%hawk_rush> CLIP THIS
[1:07:27] <Enz0ned> quick someone call 2 mello
[1:07:27] <%nmaten> thats the easiest way to discern rhythm
[1:07:28] <%GenericDivi> "just learn the game"
[1:07:29] <+TheStarvingGood> I mean this track is breakbeat how bout some edm to get the idea?
[1:07:29] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat you dont have to know literally anything about music to play this game, its just watching patterns and predicting enemies
[1:07:32] <televisedrevolting> Just play to the rhythm.
[1:07:33] <%AbnormalVoid> ??????
[1:07:34] <aimlesshealer> Yes!
[1:07:35] <Caidezes> Just ignore chat and play the game.
[1:07:38] <Novillion> Do you enjoy listening to music at all even?
[1:07:41] <Sitromxe> Oh no.
[1:07:41] <%GenericDivi> you got it
[1:07:42] <lizard0tm> Oh man
[1:07:42] <%GoldeNOVA> White man can't hip or hop.
[1:07:42] <pimpinahz> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:07:43] <$ESP_ROOT> YEAAH
[1:07:44] <%GenericDivi> kinda
[1:07:46] <Kalcom> out of synch sadly
[1:07:47] <Dementedpenguin> Wait. Are people actually explaining things to Pat with actual musical terms?
[1:07:48] <NumberTooBig> have you tried using a Diatonic to Cadenza your Bitonality
[1:07:48] <+megaotter> how does this helptho?
[1:07:48] <+MisterMusashi> mendoHmm
[1:07:48] <Tisaric> that's 4/4
[1:07:49] <+Antoids> zone 2 is probably not the place to practice fundamentals though
[1:07:50] <KatabolicRage> we can say he's got it when he isn't taking damage
[1:07:50] <tungstenviper> you're out of beat LUL
[1:07:50] <%NovraSplice> It's really not all about the music and beats, just play and learn enemy patterns
[1:07:51] <%RadicalPirate> YES
[1:07:53] <%hawk_rush> we're getting there!!
[1:07:53] <+swagocrates> do you feel in tune with the music when you bob your head with it or count? thats learning the beat
[1:07:53] <+DismalDavid> it like learning drums
[1:07:58] <%RadicalPirate> ha ha, now you've got it
[1:07:58] <%yeknomlive> it's like watching a baby deer learning to walk
[1:07:59] <jubejube56> wait if pat plays this off reaction, does that mean he looks at the heart all the time to know when to move?
[1:08:00] <lizard0tm> Off bet, but close
[1:08:01] <throwaway9989> just follow the big BOOM BOOM beat
[1:08:02] <T_Sasquatch> the PATTERNS PAT
[1:08:02] <%NovraSplice> It's a hard game to learn
[1:08:03] <lizard0tm> beat
[1:08:04] <krymzen5> omg its worki
[1:08:04] <lejeune> i am angry at pat for being bad at muzak
[1:08:04] <%brickwall35> is this possibly the worst game a musically illiterate person could play?
[1:08:05] <%hawk_rush> a bit out of sync tho
[1:08:05] <Darren716> @AngriestPat Just play the ishtar trailer in the background
[1:08:06] <%Reaped_Psyche> You're actually doing better
[1:08:07] <reonome> @jubejube56 yes
[1:08:08] <Zebens> monkaS
[1:08:09] <TheBlankAce> Well you kinda got it in a fucked up way
[1:08:10] <worldbrand> This isnt actually going to help him is it
[1:08:10] <gigakits> He's doing it chat PogChamp
[1:08:10] <%Typhaeon> Is Pat the Ringo Starr of the Zaibatsu?
[1:08:12] <$rdark_ksu> Thats called a beat
[1:08:15] <%spiritofmojave> considerably better
[1:08:18] <austinj24> Holy shit
[1:08:18] <%yeknomlive> "she sells seashell by the seashore!"
[1:08:20] <basswizard11> the music in every stage lines up with when the lines are hitting the heart... everything is moving in rythm to the music and lines are showing you when the beat is
[1:08:22] <%GenericDivi> PogChamp
[1:08:22] <%akingofnoobs> ohhh shit
[1:08:26] <Abecale> MY WHITE BOI HAS BEAT!!
[1:08:26] <%GenericDivi> Almost
[1:08:27] <Animal_Farm4> @AngriestPat As a musician, I can tell you that you don't need to know SHIT about music to play this. Just know that enemies have a set pattern based on beats. Find the start of their pattern, then learn how many beats it takes for them to attack or move.
[1:08:27] <Zebens> LUL
[1:08:28] <Nina96> feel like a parent trying to teach a kid how to read chat?
[1:08:28] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat just sync your pacemaker to the beat
[1:08:28] <lizard0tm> Close
[1:08:29] <%Typhaeon> So close
[1:08:29] <Novillion> I think he learned it guys
[1:08:29] <Psychoduckk> That was ghood
[1:08:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:08:30] <SunsetJack> Miscounted?
[1:08:30] <+linSP> getting gooder
[1:08:31] <beigesamurai> YOU KNOW A PAUSE COMBO? Think 4 hits, then pause, then 4 hits again
[1:08:31] <AtlasMcCoy> BUT YOURE LEARNING
[1:08:31] <%GenericDivi> You're getting the hang of it
[1:08:31] <+Antoids> lost the timing a little there
[1:08:31] <%GrayMatterMiner> @AngriestPat basically all enemies follow a pattern based off of 4/4 time, the trick is to figure out where in the 1-4 pattern they are doing nothing and where their action is
[1:08:31] <NumberTooBig> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[1:08:31] <foreverN2dust> clsoe
[1:08:32] <gigakits> HE'S LEARNING PogChamp

[1:08:36] <cj_art> almost :O
[1:08:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> PROGRESS
[1:08:37] <%skizzuto> His problem isn't being able to feel the beat, his problem is not knowing enemy patterns

[1:08:38] <NJigglypuff> pat isnt even the pat of the zaibatsu

[1:08:42] <emillionghost> BETTER! <3
[1:08:43] <+BKNPham> just play risk of rain 2. no music rhythms.
[1:08:43] <lizard0tm> He's Learning! I clapped

[1:08:52] <sir_nack> yes
[1:08:52] <TheBlankAce> We raised this boy
[1:08:52] <$cureneckbeard> 1 2 3 4

[1:08:53] <pimpinahz> yeeeeeeessssssss
[1:08:53] <%GrayMatterMiner> you dont have to
[1:08:53] <soraabora> yes
[1:08:53] <Innocuous_Goat> It becomes automatic
[1:08:53] <+decisivelynameless> You eventually don't have to.
[1:08:53] <%akingofnoobs> kinda
[1:08:53] <$ESP_ROOT> subconciously
[1:08:54] <%Hiro01231> yes and no

[1:08:56] <SixthSun2> YES
[1:08:56] <%AbnormalVoid> no
[1:08:56] <%spiritofmojave> or foot tapping it yeah
[1:08:56] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[1:08:56] <+thenoodle007> Not really
[1:08:56] <throwaway9989> and step and 1, 2, 3, 4
[1:08:56] <tungstenviper> n o
[1:08:57] <+JavaManJoJo> sometimes
[1:08:57] <Novillion> They feel it
[1:08:57] <NJigglypuff> sorta?
[1:08:57] <%astropupp> sometimes
[1:08:57] <+MisterMusashi> More or less, yeah.
[1:08:57] <Onamar> That's how you do music
[1:08:57] <SchroedingersFerret> Yes
[1:08:57] <+Antoids> youve never tapped your fingers to a song?
[1:08:58] <+Jeikujeiku> no it just comes natural
[1:08:58] <%galaxyswirl> not at all @AngriestPat
[1:08:58] <emillionghost> SOMETIMES
[1:08:58] <%akingofnoobs> its more instinct
[1:08:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Some people just feel the beat naturally.
[1:08:58] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat no people feel the rythmn
[1:08:59] <%skizzuto> subconsciously
[1:08:59] <%HiroTSK5> Constantly
[1:08:59] <basswizard11> the music is signaling you... you can feel it in your body
[1:08:59] <%Typhaeon> It becomes unconscious after a while
[1:08:59] <%brickwall35> Pat, most people can subconsiouscly keep a beat
[1:09:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> Music is math
[1:09:00] <NickHatesSnow> oh yeah
[1:09:00] <cj_art> i gues ? ?
[1:09:00] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> its second nature, but yes
[1:09:00] <natebud> its something you FEEL pat.
[1:09:00] <%Keaton_x> Pretty much
[1:09:00] <%GrayMatterMiner> not really, but sure
[1:09:00] <+Gamefriendly> don't think, feeeel
[1:09:00] <+thenoodle007> It's a feeling
[1:09:01] <fabo_joyful> sorta
[1:09:01] <%NovraSplice> Depends on the person
[1:09:01] <%AbnormalVoid> they feel it
[1:09:02] <+InstiGaitan> Absolutely not
[1:09:02] <%CrookedSpiral> sorta
[1:09:02] <+ebenezer_squeezer> i tap my foot
[1:09:02] <Mechazoic_Era> yes, but it becomes second nature and doesn't feel like counting sometimes
[1:09:02] <EchoeSpaceMANE> nah
[1:09:02] <jubejube56> sort of, you learn to FEEL it
[1:09:03] <+swagocrates> some people have to some people can do it natureally
[1:09:03] <krymzen5> kinda, but it becomes natural
[1:09:03] <Sitromxe> Pretty much.
[1:09:03] <Saltmeisterr> or you feel it
[1:09:03] <Flannel_Pajams> well some people have rythym
[1:09:03] <SweetCuppingCake> You can or you can just feel it
[1:09:03] <%SaltyDongs> nerds
[1:09:03] <austinj24> THATS MUSIC
[1:09:04] <+Jeikujeiku> at first its counting
[1:09:05] <SidBoyTM> Sort of
[1:09:05] <$afronooch> yeah, until it becomes instinct
[1:09:05] <foreverN2dust> A lot till you can feel it
[1:09:05] <pimpinahz> yes yes yes YEEEEESSSSSS
[1:09:05] <Nina96> @AngriestPat thats what music does in your brain\
[1:09:06] <+Grayhammatter> you don't need to, but it helps
[1:09:06] <SwindlerOfProgress> Some people just keep the beat.
[1:09:06] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat we internalize it
[1:09:06] <%Tucker0603> I tap my foot and it becomes second nature
[1:09:06] <+linSP> you CAN
[1:09:06] <Novillion> they feel it!
[1:09:07] <%mostundesired> @AngriestPat Yes, but also no, because most people don't need to count.
[1:09:07] <StaticSunrise> they FEEL it
[1:09:07] <HordeofTribbles> people who play music are almost constantly counting
[1:09:07] <%hawk_rush> not everyone, but it helps. in music, kind of without thinking about it
[1:09:07] <%BigNerdSam> Theyre counting in the soul brain
[1:09:08] <emillionghost> sometimes.
[1:09:08] <NeroCapone> @AngriestPat YOU GOTTA FEEL THE MUSIC BABY!
[1:09:08] <%Agami23> pretty much, but then you get good and dont need to
[1:09:09] <lizard0tm> Most of the time yes, or with a metronomoe
[1:09:09] <%velemi> you gotta FEEL
[1:09:09] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat You count at first to learn then you don't need to anymore
[1:09:09] <soraabora> you're like doing it subconsciously
[1:09:09] <%GrayMatterMiner> music is MATH
[1:09:09] <energywarning> type faster
[1:09:09] <%daveronald> when learning
[1:09:10] <Fordlotus> You gotta FEEL IT
[1:09:10] <DraxTD> they do MATH @AngriestPat
[1:09:11] <dezik45> Yes
[1:09:11] <tungstenviper> YOU HAVE TO FEEL
[1:09:11] <%akingofnoobs> it helps in the beginning
[1:09:11] <$spardanwarrior> After a while you stop thinking about it.
[1:09:11] <immortan_joel> Pat do you know what rhythm is?
[1:09:11] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> you feel it in your soul pat @AngriestPat
[1:09:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> yeah
[1:09:12] <+megaotter> @skizzuto agreed. knowing beat is useless if you don't know attack patterns
[1:09:13] <Papafleish> i gotta go poopoo
[1:09:13] <%Aztec50> thats what i do sometimes
[1:09:13] <Dementedpenguin> Jesus Christ. Chat is a mess.
[1:09:13] <%Ponch65> apatHoldon
[1:09:13] <Zebens> gotta go fast SOnic
[1:09:13] <ZComiX> Pat try on the stone guys Attack, attack, withdraw, attack attack, withdraw ect.
[1:09:14] <$nademonkey1100> IS PAT GETTING RYTHEME
[1:09:14] <$KnivesEve> dont think, feel @AngriestPat
[1:09:15] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> No, unless you suck at it.
[1:09:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It varies, but theree is usually some sort of inner metronome
[1:09:15] <%Typhaeon> It's the mental equivalent of muscle memory
[1:09:16] <$ESP_ROOT> instinctually
[1:09:17] <+Bustamente> YES THATS MUSIC
[1:09:18] <%mercado94> hi
[1:09:19] <%ArcanumMBD> Some people are, others tap their foot, it varies by person
[1:09:19] <3viltiki> It's like learning time for a Dark Souls boss @AngriestPat
[1:09:19] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Playing music you get to feel for it. I know the down intuitively, but it took a while
[1:09:19] <Ordinaryknight> Kinda. Eventually it becomes subconscious
[1:09:20] <%akingofnoobs> FEEL THE MUSIC
[1:09:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's how music works
[1:09:20] <MoverAndAShaker80> Do you have the game sound turned off?
[1:09:21] <StromkoPenguin> You're basically learning a dance, counting out the beat is normal when you're learning
[1:09:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Someone buy Pat a metronome Kappa
[1:09:22] <%nmaten> you know what a conductor is there for right @AngriestPat ?
[1:09:23] <tank7013> You learn to just do it subconsciously
[1:09:23] <Enz0ned> kinda of like a mental metronome
[1:09:23] <+thenoodle007> Do you feel it Pat? Kappa
[1:09:24] <%astropupp> we are passionate about s o u n d
[1:09:24] <%kyuubisonic> the human body kinda does it for you
[1:09:25] <+FrostedZaibatsu> It becomes second nature like breathing
[1:09:25] <throwaway9989> it's a feeling
[1:09:26] <disister1201> eventually people who are good at music can just do it without counting
[1:09:26] <pimpinahz> Feel the chungus Math in your soul
[1:09:26] <HordeofTribbles> music is nice sounding math
[1:09:26] <mrtaney> you feel it after a while
[1:09:26] <%frobeards> that's how people LEARN music
[1:09:27] <ScrapSentinel> jesus chat is so fucking heated tonight LUL
[1:09:28] <al0nem0nster> okay you know how you don't have to count the seconds when doing nero's combo's, you just know how long you have to wait? same thing.
[1:09:29] <%lewdskeletor13> How did you go so long without knowing this
[1:09:29] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat the caveman is discovering music fundamentals
[1:09:30] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat Try listening to a Metronome
[1:09:30] <+linSP> this beat is all uh uh uh UH
[1:09:30] <tungstenviper> FEEL THE BEAT
[1:09:30] <%HyperCharge_Sam> you can bob your head too
[1:09:31] <%GenericDivi> It's common that musicians count in their heads but after a certain point it's something you just know how to deal with
[1:09:31] <jubejube56> you can count but eventually it becomes a feeling
[1:09:32] <+Grayhammatter> can you FEEL it?
[1:09:32] <DraxTD> tap your foot @AngriestPat
[1:09:32] <%daveronald> count until you learn it
[1:09:32] <Innocuous_Goat> It's like riding a bike
[1:09:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Animal_Farm4) (warning)
[1:09:33] <krymzen5> it starts like tht then becomes 2nd nature like breathing @AngriestPat
[1:09:34] <Caidezes> Pat doesn't music, chat.
[1:09:37] <%brickwall35> 1-2-3-Dodge, repeat
[1:09:37] <Zebens> Do you feel it now Mr. Krabs
[1:09:38] <$ESP_ROOT> ELMO NO
[1:09:38] <%Aztec50> i think counting would help
[1:09:38] <+Bustamente> Eventually you feel it but more difficult parts yes its counting
[1:09:38] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat your problem isn't that you can't keep the beat, your problem is you need to learn enemy patterns
[1:09:39] <Sitromxe> Music is just maths, therefore all musicians are nerds.
[1:09:39] <a_mad_dragon> pat has no soul
[1:09:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> pretty much
[1:09:40] <jubejube56> that is where the 5,6,7,8 comes from
[1:09:40] <soraabora> pat thats basically waht a conductor does when they move their hand in front of an orchestra? they're kinda like counting for everyone else
[1:09:42] <Ner234> ELMO YES
[1:09:42] <$rdark_ksu> its a background part of your brain once you know it
[1:09:43] <+Antoids> try not walking to any sort of beat; it's harder than doing it to a beat. it's something people are able to do instinctively
[1:09:46] <+Jeikujeiku> First its counting then it becomes instinct
[1:09:46] <DraxTD> elmo got rhythem
[1:09:47] <%mostundesired> It helps you count.
[1:09:47] <natebud> maybe youre not a foot tapping man, try bobbing, rocking, maybe stomping.
[1:09:48] <%FrustratedAF> white people have no rhythm.
[1:09:49] <$ESP_ROOT> to keep the beat
[1:09:49] <$afronooch> helps count
[1:09:50] <TranquilTurnip> it helps
[1:09:50] <+TehBeerBaron> It's subconscious counting
[1:09:51] <%akingofnoobs> it helps u stay on beat
[1:09:51] <Seitine> It's like when you tell someone you don't care for music and they shit the bed and just can't understand LUL
[1:09:52] <emillionghost> it becomes subconscious or memory after counting-practice
[1:09:52] <+ebenezer_squeezer> IT HELPS KEEP ON BEAT
[1:09:52] <worldbrand> show feet
[1:09:52] <%XzileGaming> chat, youre assuming Pat has a heart, wherein he has a natural rythym.
[1:09:52] <%brickwall35> to keep the rhythm
[1:09:53] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat YOUTUBEW 4 4 BEAT
[1:09:53] <tungstenviper> IT'S THE BASICS
[1:09:54] <Saltmeisterr> same thing as counting
[1:09:54] <%HyperCharge_Sam> to keep rythem to the beat dummy
[1:09:54] <+Haarute> Or bop your head. Anything.
[1:09:54] <Innocuous_Goat> So you can feel the rhythm
[1:09:55] <%GrayMatterMiner> to get on beat
[1:09:55] <%CrookedSpiral> move on the taps
[1:09:56] <%galaxyswirl> helps keep the beat
[1:09:56] <Caidezes> Tap your dick.
[1:09:56] <%graffitisamurai> Ever bop your head to the beat?
[1:09:56] <Mechazoic_Era> helps maintain rhythm
[1:09:57] <jubejube56> that man has a foot fetish, do not listen pat
[1:09:57] <televisedrevolting> Helps you keep rhythm.
[1:09:57] <$ESP_ROOT> it doesnt have to be your foot
[1:09:57] <Nina96> @AngriestPat it helps count
[1:09:57] <Ordinaryknight> Elmo wants to music too
[1:09:57] <NeroCapone> do you literally never tap your foot when you listen to music LUL
[1:09:57] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat it helps you keep the beat
[1:09:57] <Deano8817> holy shit pat you're so fucking white
[1:09:58] <%AbnormalVoid> SO YOU FEEL THE RHYTHM
[1:09:58] <%TheDullaMAN> The vibration's supposed to help you memorize the beat.
[1:09:58] <+Gamefriendly> Remember Bruce Lee's most famous quote: "don't think, feeeeeeel" Kappa
[1:09:58] <%ClutchRoadagain> Your sense of rhythm is like a secret sense in your brain, once you unlock it it's there forever.
[1:09:58] <lizard0tm> Is every song in the game at the same bpm? I would assume not, so that makes a metronome useless
[1:09:58] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat for some people it helps keep the rhythm. It might not help with you
[1:09:59] <+thenoodle007> Tap your belly Kappa
[1:09:59] <al0nem0nster> because the body is better at keeping rythm than the brain.
[1:10:00] <Kalcom> keeps the rythm
[1:10:00] <ZComiX> tappnig you foot will keep the rhythm in your heead
[1:10:01] <%RadicalPirate> helps you keep count subconsciously
[1:10:01] <+Antoids> tapping your foot helps you keep track of the rhythm passively, you can sync button presses with foot taps which are maintaining
[1:10:01] <Zyczenn> How do you live
[1:10:01] <Vivalabonte> KEEP THE BEAT
[1:10:01] <AuksMattin> to feel the beat in your body
[1:10:02] <legoaisu> Most people that keep a beat tap their foot to the beat of the song
[1:10:02] <$nademonkey1100> cap your ass its just to keep rythem
[1:10:02] <%Agami23> we all know his feet cant reach the floor to tap it
[1:10:02] <+teg88> @AngriestPat It's to keep time
[1:10:03] <%akingofnoobs> that way you dont have to count the beats
[1:10:03] <+cgmerryo> it's the same thing as bobbing your head
[1:10:03] <zedravan> You guys know he can't reach the floor
[1:10:03] <NickHatesSnow> We need to adjust to Crazy if we wanna get through
[1:10:03] <HordeofTribbles> tapping your foot helps you keep rhythm, its like the first thing you are taught in learning music
[1:10:04] <%spiritofmojave> You keep the beat easier than counting it in your head
[1:10:04] <TheMeromex> he has to be trolling
[1:10:04] <+JackMillerTime> the foot taps are the beat
[1:10:04] <T_Sasquatch> just DANCE LUL . Feel the rhythm
[1:10:05] <SidBoyTM> Tapping your feet helps keep the rythm
[1:10:05] <$valriot> PAT ARE YOU AN ALIEN
[1:10:05] <%maskedriderhero> Keep the beat you fuck
[1:10:05] <a_mad_dragon> you don't HAVE to understand, JUST DO IT
[1:10:05] <%NovraSplice> What do you mean
[1:10:06] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Tap anything. It just gets you practice with your rhythm
[1:10:06] <+Jeikujeiku> helps you keep the rhythm consistent
[1:10:07] <%velemi> it sychronizes your body motions, including your presses
[1:10:07] <Vivalabonte> ROCK THE BEAT
[1:10:07] <+ebenezer_squeezer> tap foot on beat
[1:10:08] <Sunditsu> They mean tap to the beat of the song
[1:10:08] <%Aztec50> with the game you could try to always move every beat
[1:10:08] <$cureneckbeard> On every fourth beat, schlorp your ball
[1:10:08] <%brickwall35> it's the equivalent to having a metronome @AngriestPat
[1:10:08] <%GarbageNirvana> You might be better off counting to four over and over
[1:10:08] <%arancet> well you could tap anything else too if you think itll keep rythm
[1:10:10] <Saltmeisterr> it helps u keep rhythn
[1:10:10] <+JavaManJoJo> chat he's too short
[1:10:10] <KatabolicRage> it doesn't help pat, he is not musically inclined, stop assuming what works for you works with someone who is tone deaf
[1:10:12] <hlreiku> This is like a whole game around the worst segment of danganronpa
[1:10:12] <Superscooter> @AngriestPat have you never tapped your foot to a song
[1:10:13] <+thenoodle007> Feeeeeeel it Pat. Just Feeeeeeeeeel it! Kappa
[1:10:13] <SixthSun2> Pat, maybe this game is not for you
[1:10:13] <disister1201> or you can hum
[1:10:13] <%Reaped_Psyche> Tapping your foot or another body part helps most people to keep rhythym.
[1:10:14] <sir_nack> guys, pat doesnt understand rhythm. he's not gonna get tapping his foot.
[1:10:14] <%NopeBadguy> pat, music is math
[1:10:14] <%HiroTSK5> @AngriestPat Tapping your foot acts as counting the beat without having to think about it
[1:10:14] <%lewdskeletor13> TO KEEP THE RYTHYM
[1:10:15] <+MisterMusashi> Musical muscle memory. Haven't you ever seen someone just bob their head to music before? @AngriestPat And if you tap your foot to the beat you always move to the beat.
[1:10:15] <%GrayMatterMiner> but you dont have to, the game is on beat so dont distract yourself
[1:10:15] <damienlunas> "One Two Three Four"
[1:10:15] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat scratch you head and tap your belly
[1:10:15] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Tap your foot and then record it so we can make sure you are doing it right.
[1:10:16] <%gazingeye1> just DO THE BUTTON THING!
[1:10:16] <+Haarute> Close your eyes and bop your head to the beat.
[1:10:18] <%akingofnoobs> tap your foot on every beat
[1:10:18] <%schlager087> schlager087 converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:10:18] <lejeune> pat aint righf
[1:10:18] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Pat, it helps, you goddamned autistic robotg.
[1:10:19] <%Hiro01231> @AngriestPat It's for keeping track of when the rhythm is, which only works if you can do it without much thot
[1:10:19] <SchroedingersFerret> HE HAS GOUT ITS HARD
[1:10:19] <%skizzuto> if it doesn't help pat, it doesn't help pat, guys
[1:10:20] <NeroCapone> Confirmed Pat literally doesn't understand the concept of music LUL
[1:10:21] <SidBoyTM> so instead of verbally counting, you just tap your feet
[1:10:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> IT doesn't HAVE TO BE your foot... just some sort of movement to the G R O O V E
[1:10:22] <lizard0tm> Guys Pat has short legs, he CAN'T tap his foot
[1:10:22] <$eldrich_horror> musicians tap thier foot to keep beat
[1:10:22] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat it's a physical motion that you can do to help you keep the beat. Counting out loud or clapping are similar. the idea is to get used to the speed of the beat
[1:10:22] <%Mitalis> tapping your foot should help you keep in sync with the pacing
[1:10:24] <pimpinahz> feel the force Pat
[1:10:25] <$afronooch> but i mean, if thats not a thing you do then it'll pribably throw you off
[1:10:25] <Mechazoic_Era> OH BOY
[1:10:26] <Novillion> Have you never done anything like that when listening to music?
[1:10:26] <foreverN2dust> If it feels weird tapping your foot you are probably off beat
[1:10:27] <Zebens> monkaS
[1:10:27] <%CuddlyZombie> @angriestpat ignore chat tapping doesn’t work for everyone
[1:10:27] <17sevens> To maintain a beat it's useful to have some part of yourself constantly repeating the beat. Tapping a foot, a finger, nodding your head, counting out loud, it's a tool.
[1:10:28] <Zebens> LUL
[1:10:29] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat use a finger on the back of the controller. Any physical tick will do the trick
[1:10:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:10:32] <+Antoids> you never want to fight dragons vertically
[1:10:32] <%CrookedSpiral> better
[1:10:33] <+InstiGaitan> Literally just play the game and learn to keep rhythm. You don't nee to tap your foot or count
[1:10:33] <+Bustamente> Ever see a musician tapping their foot? its like dancing
[1:10:34] <Kalcom> ?
[1:10:34] <AuksMattin> try bobbing your head or body instead of your feet
[1:10:34] <DraxTD> heheh
[1:10:35] <+Grayhammatter> mortis
[1:10:35] <InfraRedRidingHood_> atpRtsd
[1:10:35] <%TeraMercier> You're so bad you actually legit need to practice tapping along to a beat. For reals
[1:10:35] <Nina96> thats on u
[1:10:36] <Khorneflakes_> Kappa Chat... how can he tap if his keep can't touch the ground
[1:10:36] <%NopeBadguy> DNotLikeThis
[1:10:36] <Superscooter> dragons are 1 2

[1:10:39] <krymzen5> pats a damnlizard person
[1:10:39] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat People are telling you to tap your foot because it's a way to establish rhythm
[1:10:39] <pimpinahz> :(
[1:10:40] <%gazingeye1> do what you were doing with the buttons!
[1:10:40] <$ESP_ROOT> nairoW
[1:10:42] <Fordlotus> M O R T I S
[1:10:43] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat dragons move every other beat. Gotta hit and run
[1:10:43] <+JackMillerTime> tap a finger say a word, doing something to the beat is the point
[1:10:43] <+Robopengy> Incredibillis
[1:10:44] <$afronooch> 3
[1:10:44] <jubejube56> well keeping the beat won't save you from that
[1:10:44] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat Use your foot as a metronome
[1:10:44] <%ElenaManetta> This is a Pat Stares At stream alright
[1:10:45] <3viltiki> try humming to the music Pat
[1:10:45] <+InstiGaitan> That'll just make it harder to focu
[1:10:45] <throwaway9989> too much brain juice to tap foot
[1:10:46] <+Antoids> dragons have no windup animation vertically
[1:10:46] <emillionghost> mortis
[1:10:46] <+Snaketsu> do you know what music is @AngriestPat
[1:10:47] <GreenBrains_> is there a metronome setting???
[1:10:47] <+linSP> CONFUSED BY CHAT
[1:10:48] <lizard0tm> 1
[1:10:48] <Innocuous_Goat> You can do it Pat. I believe in you
[1:10:48] <SidBoyTM> Pat it's okay..
[1:10:49] <dipstere> you can nod your head instead of tapping your foot, counting 1234 per second
[1:10:50] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat dont worry about the foot tapping bullshit, just play and watch the enemy patterns
[1:10:51] <%FrustratedAF> pat needs woolie.
[1:10:52] <al0nem0nster> the wave of advice seems to be doing more harm than good
[1:10:52] <Tisaric> pivot to RoR2 at this point
[1:10:52] <Nina96> 1
[1:10:52] <Bamcrash> Dragons are rough, that's okay
[1:10:53] <gigakits> I like this dancing dragon it's kind of cute
[1:10:53] <T_Sasquatch> do you not listen to music ??
[1:10:53] <+timbob> It's okay Pat, rhythm games aren't for everyone atpRtsd
[1:10:54] <+MisterMusashi> Wowee
[1:10:55] <KatabolicRage> honestly people are just throwing too many esoteric suggestions
[1:10:55] <dezik45> Tapping your foot gives you a physical way of keeping track of the beat, so you don’t have to rely on thinking about it or saying it.
[1:10:55] <%hawk_rush> poor pat
[1:10:55] <natebud> pat are you able to clap your hands to the beat?
[1:10:57] <EVOriginal> I have the urge to see Pat try to play Dance Dance Revolution now.
[1:10:57] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat Listin, just Tap your ass and scratch you head

[1:11:03] <$ESP_ROOT> that wasnt a rhythm problem. that was a you not knowing the pattern problem

[1:11:15] <+MisterMusashi> cecevrFire cecevrWhelp
[1:11:15] <TranquilTurnip> if you can learn to tap your foot to the beat while you play it it will help you keep time, it will be destracting at first but then it will help
[1:11:16] <ZComiX> Pat is an episode of phinas and ferb
[1:11:16] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Ignore the chat, just focus on the beat, FOCUS ON THE BEAT, taht's all.

[1:11:49] <Seitine> The game is about PATTERNS, while using rhythm as a method to convey that.

[1:11:50] <%Tucker0603> this is AMAZING
[1:11:50] <+Antoids> the golem has more rhythm than you and he's made of stone

[1:12:23] <lizard0tm> Equally as bad
[1:12:24] <%GrayMatterMiner> just go from reaction, but learn the pattern
[1:12:24] <%ElenaManetta> Now THIS is the rhythm game I came here for

[1:13:00] <+TehBeerBaron> @AngriestPat I'm pretty sure there is a "no music beat only" mode in the options

[1:13:14] <Flannel_Pajams> how do you play a rythym game muted?
[1:13:15] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Just look at the heart pat. Every time the heart beats count up, when you get to 4 start over again from 1.

[1:13:15] <ZComiX> Besides I ain't got rhythm No I ain't got rhythm Said I ain't got rhythm I ain't got rhythm
[1:13:16] <Ner234> This is going STRAIGHT to the subreddit. People NEED to see this shit. LUL
[1:13:16] <Caidezes> This is the best. Thanks chat.
[1:13:16] <%Aztec50> @angriestpat you can keep time with your movements if you move every beat
[1:13:18] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Ragnarok_Flames subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! YEYEYE WHAT UP YOU BIG NERD. one whole strem baby
[1:13:19] <dalollypop> ASMR controller clicks
[1:13:20] <%Hilleltaco> This feels like a crime
[1:13:20] <EdwardGreene1> God I can hear the clicking out of rhythm
[1:13:22] <%akingofnoobs> ASMR clicks
[1:13:22] <$eldrich_horror> let play the music game without music lol
[1:13:22] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Normal humans can FEEL the beat. The feeling that makes you nod your head or tap your foot. THAT is the beat.
[1:13:22] <person181> i mean it's working
[1:13:23] <+Bustamente> What are you some kinda psycho?
[1:13:23] <%Reizie_Etherealm> If he hasn't picked up the rhythm from playing along the beat already then he'll never pick it up
[1:13:24] <+WoolieTHEpieTHIEF1> mute music in a music based game?????? But WHY?
[1:13:25] <%schlager087> Elite gamer beats rhythem game with no rhythem
[1:13:25] <pimpinahz> Life has a rhythm in everything...like right now
[1:13:26] <Sheepeze> just do what works for you and learn enemy beat patterns
[1:13:27] <ZComiX> You're kidding me right, you're, you're kidding me Don't you see what you were doing right then That's a wicked groove you were starting to move Mr., you got rhythm times 10
[1:13:28] <%yeknomlive> tap your foot!
[1:13:29] <Zebens> PogChamp
[1:13:31] <%DedlokPM> @pimpinahz So people just either can't feel or hear it audibly. They can see some visually just not audibly.
[1:13:31] <cj_art> if it helps pat, you can see their attack animation prior to when you make your move
[1:13:35] <tungstenviper> THIS IS FUN LUL
[1:13:35] <TranquilTurnip> This MIGHT be the most insane thing pat's ever done
[1:13:36] <TheBlankAce> This is the most cursed thing ever
[1:13:37] <NumberTooBig> rhythm games without music NotLikeThis
[1:13:37] <%BigNerdSam> This is some sick ASMR material.
[1:13:38] <KilljoyHexx> I-is pat pl-play a rhythm game...wi-with the sound off...
[1:13:39] <Kalcom> WE DID IT
[1:13:41] <goddamndavid> why is there no music in this music based game?
[1:13:41] <%bluemorning104> pat, we can hear every controller click, this is hell
[1:13:43] <%HyperCharge_Sam> guys his feet are too short to tap his foot
[1:13:43] <%brickwall35> Pat you're literally tapping to the beat
[1:13:44] <T_Sasquatch> this is insane
[1:13:44] <+Bustamente> Lets watch pat play a music game muted!
[1:13:45] <ZComiX> think perhaps that your not listening I find it tedious to repeat It's no big crime I just can't keep time
[1:13:46] <Kalcom> FIRST FLOOR CLEAR
[1:13:47] <$rdark_ksu> oh this just feels wrong
[1:13:47] <%hawk_rush> hmmm
[1:13:48] <lizard0tm> Imagine playing a rhythm game with no sound, it sucks
[1:13:48] <%ElenaManetta> Now would be the time for Pat to scream HONK
[1:13:48] <+swagocrates> no this is so wrong
[1:13:49] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis
[1:13:50] <prime_name> What's up with the mute?
[1:13:50] <MissMalisin> I'm deaf monkaS
[1:13:51] <Laicuss> this is a yikes
[1:13:51] <+MisterMusashi> I want to fucking die lobosDied
[1:13:52] <%akingofnoobs> the only way for pat to play this game is to take out the most important part
[1:13:52] <+Haarute> The controller is keeping a beat quite nicely.
[1:13:54] <pimpinahz> @angriestpat you created a fawking rythm with your button pressing hahahaha
[1:13:54] <DeathByPoke7> wait there is supposed to be no sound
[1:13:55] <Abecale> Omg pat you are the strangest boi
[1:13:55] <%Tearonex> hmmmmmmmmmm

[1:13:56] <Zebens> UL
[1:13:56] <%spiritofmojave> Necrodancer without 3.4K songs LUL
[1:13:57] <%TheDullaMAN> @AngriestPat Everything in this game has a pattern. Those patterns coincide with the passage of 4 lines (beats). To play the game better, understand what the enemies do within 4 lines passing.
[1:13:57] <Zebens> LUL
[1:13:57] <Kalcom> OR NOT
[1:13:58] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat This is the most insane thing I have ever seen you do
[1:13:59] <Plague_bagel> i love how they each have a really unique neurosis that effects things people usually see as normal
[1:13:59] <al0nem0nster> there it goes whoever just said that, right now he's tapping the controller to the beat
[1:14:00] <aimlesshealer> Oh my god this is the best thing ever
[1:14:00] <$ESP_ROOT> OMEGALUL
[1:14:00] <$nademonkey1100> i want to see pat dancing
[1:14:00] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat if you want to ignore the music, play the BARD
[1:14:02] <natebud> Pat have you ever listened to music before?
[1:14:02] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Just focus on the beat, that's ALL you need.
[1:14:02] <zedravan> Try bard mode?
[1:14:03] <ZComiX> I'm telling you I lost the beat I don't need my face on t-shirts Or hit a power-chord guitar They were screaming my name
[1:14:04] <%mercado94> what happening? I leave for a minute and now theres no music?
[1:14:04] <%FrustratedAF> the floor??
[1:14:05] <EdwardGreene1> I too love playing game with great soundtracks on mute
[1:14:05] <DigbyMayor> What the fuck
[1:14:06] <T_Sasquatch> you muted the music in a rhythm game
[1:14:06] <LodiFrostbeard> PAT PLEASE
[1:14:07] <SwindlerOfProgress> @prime_name Pat's pretending he does better without the music.
[1:14:09] <%Reaped_Psyche> cheer100 Tapping your foot is a physical trick that many find helpful to keep their brain focused on a rythym by linking muscle memory to it. The 4/4 thing is more useful for people playing music or dancing in patterns than it is for this game where you aren't worried about hitting a predetermined arrangement of actions. cheer100
[1:14:10] <throwaway9989> The sound of silence has sick beatz
[1:14:10] <%CuddlyZombie> Try bard mode
[1:14:10] <SunsetJack> The second zone takes a while to get use to.

[1:14:35] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat you know what, play Bard
[1:14:35] <%frsttcs> just tuned in and actually thought my speaker was broken
[1:14:36] <Psyramics> playing crypt of the necrodancer without music is like playing sekiro without deflecting
[1:14:38] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Alternatively, play Bard.
[1:14:39] <%ClutchRoadagain> Call a music friend
[1:14:40] <%CuddlyZombie> Bard mode
[1:14:42] <Kalcom> go to character select
[1:14:42] <televisedrevolting> Call the Paige of Mustard.
[1:14:44] <%thackattack00> This whole week of streams is gonna be something else
[1:14:44] <$rdark_ksu> Pat if elephants can paint i'm sure you can understand music.
[1:14:46] <aimlesshealer> Game's a bit loud now
[1:14:46] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat if you're having trouble with the rhythm shit play Bard to learn enemy patterns at your own pace
[1:14:47] <+celestian22> not the worst but its making a top 10
[1:14:49] <Nina96> Paige we need an adult...
[1:14:50] <%astropupp> music? in MY rhythm game?
[1:14:51] <+MisterMusashi> @AngriestPat How often do you think people dance to literally no sound? Jebaited
[1:14:54] <+WoolieTHEpieTHIEF1> im not sure whats more insane? Fearing that everyone everywhere is rubbing balls or something or playing this game muted!!
[1:14:55] <%ThePuddingDead> crazy talllk
[1:14:56] <%Typhaeon> Playing a music game without music isn't the best way to learn music
[1:14:57] <%Mitalis> Let's face it people, this is pat we're talking about, if he can't dance, then he certainly can't keep a beat going.
[1:14:58] <$valriot> That was like someone watching a movie with their eyes closed
[1:14:59] <Zebens> Pog
[1:14:59] <%galaxyswirl> try playing bard is the common idea im seeing @AngriestPat
[1:15:01] <damienlunas> Just play Bard mode
[1:15:02] <%GrayMatterMiner> telling him to try and match the beat by head bobbing wont do anything if he's already doing that with the controller
[1:15:03] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat can you hear the hats in the song? Vibe to that, they will never lead you astray
[1:15:04] <MoverAndAShaker80> Y'know what, maybe you WOULD be better off practicing Zone 1
[1:15:05] <televisedrevolting> The mushrooms attack on the 2nd beat.
[1:15:07] <%CuddlyZombie> Play bard mode
[1:15:07] <Sitromxe> Remember to always do 4/4. Don't get distracted when things get hectic.

[1:15:11] <%astropupp> it's more likely than you think
[1:15:14] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat think of beats as atb turns in sections of 4 per cycle

[1:15:36] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.

[1:15:51] <xmetalicdemonx> Jesus christ man!
[1:15:51] <+megaotter> idk why chat is even trying to teach him 4/4 pattern when not every enemy in the game attacks every 4th beat
[1:15:52] <%tasenhall> your autonomic nervous system has got you dude so relax and count away
[1:15:53] <%astropupp> okay no the heart thing makes sense
[1:15:54] <%rubbishbinge> it ok pat just do a thing how you wanna thinking thing it
[1:15:55] <%XzileGaming> going for the PERFECT RUN boys
[1:15:55] <+Jeikujeiku> Have you ever tried tackling these irrational thoughts
[1:15:55] <%ecolli37108> you could always change the song to something a lot slower
[1:15:55] <+thenoodle007> Is easy mode selectable yet? Kappa
[1:15:56] <damienlunas> Bard is unlocked by default
[1:15:56] <%Eclipse_knight_> my heart beat keeps me awake at night
[1:15:56] <imbatman37> just why
[1:15:56] <worldbrand> That's honestly the least surprising thing i've heard about pat
[1:15:56] <%velemi> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
[1:15:58] <%Tearonex> You know, I've had that feeling too but I know that's not real
[1:15:59] <NJigglypuff> never heard of that before. thats interesting
[1:15:59] <+WoolieTHEpieTHIEF1> sometimes i fear for your mental health pat
[1:16:00] <%BigNerdSam> That's the most @angriestpat shit ive heard.
[1:16:00] <Zyczenn> How do you live like this
[1:16:01] <%Mitalis> @AngriestPat if you hear your heart beating, it's because you're drinking TOO MUCH Red Bull
[1:16:01] <%R0bobot> Does Pat run his body in developer mode?
[1:16:01] <MoverAndAShaker80> You have a fear of hearing your own heartbeat?
[1:16:01] <Nina96> PAIGE HELP PLZ!!!
[1:16:02] <Ion_Laser> WutFace NotLikeThis cmonBruh FailFish
[1:16:02] <Novillion> You are an unnatural person, Pat
[1:16:04] <$ESP_ROOT> can we wrap pat up in a blanket and give him hot cocoa? he needs it.
[1:16:04] <%FrustratedAF> that's some manual breathing shit
[1:16:05] <pimpinahz> hahahahahahahahaha I'm dying here
[1:16:05] <%Rngiddion> fears dont have to be sensible chat
[1:16:06] <$cureneckbeard> Learning about Pat's weird anxieties is lore
[1:16:07] <disister1201> are you human?
[1:16:07] <%astropupp> i mean not like real sense but anxiety sense
[1:16:07] <Sitromxe> That isn't a thing pat. You can't turn off your heart.
[1:16:08] <al0nem0nster> maybe dark souls it,go slow and cowardly and take a few seconds to figure out pattern
[1:16:08] <%Reaped_Psyche> I have Cardi B phobia too.
[1:16:09] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat Bard is honestly pretty good for learning patterns
[1:16:11] <%spiritofmojave> You give yourself an irregular heart beat w h a t
[1:16:12] <zipfile777> @AngriestPat are you srs?
[1:16:12] <%Hammerknife> didn't pat say on a podcast that he doesn't listen to music
[1:16:12] <DigbyMayor> I will beg and plead for Bard mode
[1:16:13] <KilljoyHexx> How can you screw up your own heart beat just by listening to it...
[1:16:14] <StaticSunrise> WAKE ME UP
[1:16:14] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat You are not so powerful that your conscious observation of a phenomenon will cause it to fuck up it's functioning
[1:16:15] <3viltiki> sing "I'm a little teapot" Pat
[1:16:17] <%CuddlyZombie> BARD MODE @angriestpat
[1:16:19] <TranquilTurnip> This has been a big week for Pat's insanity
[1:16:19] <Saltmeisterr> pat has been devolving this entire week
[1:16:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can't turn off your heart beat pat.
[1:16:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I'm actually not gonna lie, I feel the same way sorta.... like if I can hear my heart, it make me freak out
[1:16:25] <$rdark_ksu> Pat hates that he poops and has a heartbeat. You and Paige are perfect you already want to be a skeleton
[1:16:26] <+Antoids> oh shit, yeah, try Bard Mode
[1:16:26] <jubejube56> @FrustratedAF dammit now I'm breathing manually
[1:16:30] <+Antoids> it turns off all the beat stuff
[1:16:37] <j3xtrom> Mimics need to be moved away from before attacking in order to not get hit
[1:16:40] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:16:42] <goddamndavid> Pat, how have you survived this long in life????????
[1:16:43] <Zebens> LUL:
[1:16:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:16:43] <worldbrand> you're also now not sure what to do with your arms, and you can feel your tongue in your mouth
[1:16:45] <Kalcom> just pick another character
[1:16:47] <+Antoids> then you can learn the game without learning beat shit
[1:16:50] <%ThePuddingDead> cant u see the golem shimmy?
[1:16:51] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat if your deeply afraid of music, just play bard
[1:16:52] <+reluctant_monkey> 死
[1:16:55] <aimlesshealer> @DocMadfox dude quit spamming that
[1:16:55] <pimpinahz> omg.. I havent laughed this hard in such a long time
[1:16:56] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Just chill, focus on the beat
[1:16:58] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat try playing as bard to learn enemy patterns
[1:16:59] <al0nem0nster> question, has he noticed the golem's crouching animation?
[1:17:00] <Zebens> LUL
[1:17:01] <+MisterMusashi> @AngriestPat Swap character to Bard if you have him, please.
[1:17:03] <+d00msdaydan> has pat unlocked bard yet?
[1:17:07] <%XzileGaming> PERFECT RUN INCOMING
[1:17:07] <DigbyMayor> Bard character please
[1:17:08] <%rubbishbinge> pick bomberman and just run away from your plorbems
[1:17:09] <jackiemas> Patrick, you are killing this music teachers soul slowly. I watch your stream with my boyfriend and he's the one who has followed....I just made a twitch account and subscribed to tell you that you were killing my soul.
[1:17:10] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[1:17:10] <+InstiGaitan> You should really start from floor 1 until you learn how the game works

[1:17:15] <+obscureanimeguy> Demit
[1:17:18] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat We are not freaking out because you are bad at the game, we are freaking out because we are discovering a part of the human condition which you seem to have escaped
[1:17:19] <+Antoids> lol
[1:17:20] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:17:20] <%Typhaeon> I think the drumline of this song is confusing him
[1:17:21] <televisedrevolting> Golems attack every 4th beat.
[1:17:21] <Nina96> @AngriestPat this hurts now pat plz...
[1:17:21] <$ESP_ROOT> Jebaited
[1:17:22] <DocMadfox> @aimlesshealer I will when he fucking learns and stops making me scream

[1:17:40] <$RaikenTB> You found the wall candy.

[1:17:54] <sjcodan> Please go play RoR2
[1:17:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> WALL CHICKEN
[1:17:55] <+Antoids> honestly, i DO think you should ignore the music, and just use the visual elements. if you DONT focus on the music, it will still passively help you keep track of the beat youre following from the visual stuff
[1:17:59] <%Kareem405> pat switch to bard for a much easier time
[1:18:02] <DigbyMayor> Play Bard for the love of god
[1:18:06] <%ThePuddingDead> understand his fist
[1:18:07] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Don't restart if you didn't earn some diamonds, those are important.
[1:18:10] <VritraReiRei> Pat, I suggesting trying the BARD character, you can ignore beats @AngriestPat

[1:18:50] <+valkuma> This music is not helping at all its like off sync
[1:18:53] <worldbrand> So was I the only person surprised to see this game on the schedule for this reason?
[1:18:55] <sjcodan> "Necrodancer NEEDS an easy mode" Pat.
[1:18:55] <Saltmeisterr> where is paige?
[1:18:55] <DotMatrixLeviathan> you need baby mode

[1:19:07] <pimpinahz> @angriestpat Hey Pat. Like Elvis Gratton..Tink Big!!!!!!! LUL LUL
[1:19:09] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Pat you need to write an article about how this game doesn't respect your timing
[1:19:10] <Novillion> Pat you have no fundamental concept of rhythm, bard mode is for you
[1:19:11] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Just accept you may be apatBig tone deaf, it's fine.

[1:19:30] <aimlesshealer> @GoldeNOVA He's not tone deaf apparently, Paige said he can sing pretty well
[1:19:30] <%XzileGaming> gettin it
[1:19:30] <sjcodan> "Actual disabled person refuses easy mode"
[1:19:31] <disister1201> if you see an enemy that you don't know how to fight just watch them and see when the move because that's their attack pattern too

[1:19:39] <Rhinoprotoss> You just hate music
[1:19:39] <$nademonkey1100> crazy talk
[1:19:40] <%nmaten> this has nothing to do with tone

[1:19:46] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u seem to be pat
[1:19:46] <$ESP_ROOT> to be fair those enemies are new
[1:19:46] <televisedrevolting> You lack rhythm?
[1:19:47] <%ecolli37108> Sing for us pat!
[1:19:47] <+linSP> tone deaf is NOT rhythm
[1:19:50] <%FrustratedAF> wut
[1:19:50] <TheBlankAce> He's just tone stupid
[1:19:50] <%hawk_rush> he has no internal rhythm
[1:19:52] <al0nem0nster> tone death and rythmless are two different things
[1:19:52] <IceCubeMan99> all you need to do learn the enemy patterns
[1:19:55] <%RadDude6969> you just gotta rhythm it
[1:19:55] <%TeraMercier> No, I'm sure you're tone deaf, but that's not relevant right now
[1:19:56] <DocMadfox> Jesus Christ I give up
[1:19:57] <reonome> he aint got no rhythm
[1:19:58] <TranquilTurnip> Pat can't feel the rhythm, he cannot feel the rhyme
[1:20:01] <Animal_Farm4> Tone deafness has nothing to do with this NotLikeThis
[1:20:02] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pats its just patterns. You're good at those. with your ocd.
[1:20:03] <sjcodan> PLEASE CeASE
[1:20:04] <+MisterMusashi> This game isn't for people who don't understand basic patterns :) cecevrDab
[1:20:07] <%spiritofmojave> internal rhythm =/= tone
[1:20:10] <jackiemas> Also the tapping of the foot is only really used in band so if he was never in band in elementary/middle school it's not something that is engrained normally. Chorus students I have do not use the foot tap but instead pat their knees and are super awkward when tapping their foot.
[1:20:12] <+MisterMusashi> Music is the pattern of life.
[1:20:12] <+Grayhammatter> that boy ain't got no rhythm
[1:20:15] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat But if you can sing, you should understand beat and rythm....it is the feeling that makes you do things on time
[1:20:16] <%Dr_DangerPhD> i want to see Pat do the 800 chain dash challenge in Hyper Light Drifter now lmao
[1:20:16] <%rubbishbinge> how can this be

[1:20:22] <Zebens> LUL
[1:20:24] <LodiFrostbeard> 3rd level is gonna fuck him up
[1:20:25] <televisedrevolting> All enemies attack on a specific beat. Just figure out when.
[1:20:26] <natebud> try tapping you heel instead of your toe
[1:20:30] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Just think of the beat as a hit in DMC, and you're trying to exceed it.
[1:20:31] <sjcodan> No
[1:20:32] <+InstiGaitan> @AngriestPat start from floor 1
[1:20:33] <%Keaton_x> Some people just don't have a sense of rhythm. I used to know a guy that loved playing DDR despite failing every song because he couldn't hit the notes in time.
[1:20:33] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat You know what might be easier for you? Look at the room tiles. Every beat they swap colors.
[1:20:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:20:34] <$ESP_ROOT> no
[1:20:36] <al0nem0nster> ignore people telling you to tap,
[1:20:38] <TheMeromex> time for risk of rain
[1:20:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:20:39] <%CuddlyZombie> Bard mode is good learning
[1:20:40] <%astropupp> enemy patterns = beat
[1:20:40] <+Antoids> just use the visual elements
[1:20:40] <jubejube56> you can sing a song by mimicing timing
[1:20:40] <lizard0tm> This here white boy ain't got no rhythm , that's all it is
[1:20:43] <Cymen90> ......length?
[1:20:45] <Nina96> @AngriestPat play risk of rain plz....

[1:20:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> yeah the but.... ah fuck it
[1:20:47] <+MisterMusashi> Bard is for people who don't understand.
[1:20:47] <%GrayMatterMiner> that meant literally nothing
[1:20:48] <disister1201> What
[1:20:48] <%mostundesired> That's literally what beat is.
[1:20:49] <%hawk_rush> @AngriestPat Can we have an "I don't understand" emote pls

[1:20:55] <%nmaten> Pat turn off the stream youre hurting us
[1:20:55] <NumberTooBig> i too measure sound in length
[1:20:56] <al0nem0nster> okay Pat, do you own a mechanical clock?
[1:20:57] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat just count out loud each button tap you do, 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
[1:20:58] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat What do you mean by length?
[1:21:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't think, feel
[1:21:00] <+VoidShaman> Keep going!
[1:21:02] <DocMadfox> Think of it as DND Rounds please, I'm actually feeling physical pain right now
[1:21:03] <+Anonylesssss> @AngriestPat Chat has very poorly explained a 4/4 beat please just youtube a 4/4 beat so it makes sense
[1:21:03] <StaticSunrise> this is the most insane you have ever sounded
[1:21:04] <reonome> sbfpSetIn
[1:21:06] <aarondight> time your movements and actions after the right length then
[1:21:08] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat that's the most ass backwards way of understanding rhythm, but that is basically what it is
[1:21:09] <%CuddlyZombie> @angriestpat bard isnt baby mode it’s labbing it out
[1:21:11] <kimkimmehface> Bomb the wall right in front of you!!!
[1:21:12] <sjcodan> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:21:17] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat every enemy's movement pattern is based on this 4 count
[1:21:17] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Pat, I really feel that you're focusing more on your idea that you don't understand, than trying to actually learn
[1:21:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:21:19] <%fallen92x> just count 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4, the enemies attack on beat 2 and 4and the giant golem thing attacks on beat 1
[1:21:20] <$ESP_ROOT> p a t g o t o b e d
[1:21:21] <%astropupp> if you mean the length of the pauses???
[1:21:28] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat When you go into combo mode the lights alternate to the beat
[1:21:28] <Sitromxe> I don't understand how your brain works.
[1:21:29] <%spiritofmojave> just feel music 4Head
[1:21:29] <%rytyoung> @angriestpat Don't worry about keeping the best by tapping etc, just follow the guitar hero lines on screen as reference for when to make your moves
[1:21:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> ! Musicians at Risk !
[1:21:30] <kimkimmehface> It has a potion!! Right in front of the shop!!
[1:21:36] <%nmaten> i mean youre not wrong just thing about the length in terms of beats instead of time @AngriestPat
[1:21:37] <+Antoids> your broadsword has a broad hitbox, 3x1, so you should use it to attack things safely by not aligning with them
[1:21:39] <disister1201> then attack at the right length
[1:21:40] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat What is it you are trying to describe when you say length? That has to be timing, right?
[1:21:42] <NumberTooBig> play baby mode, pat
[1:21:44] <%rytyoung> the beat*

[1:21:51] <Zebens> LUL
[1:21:51] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat it's just attack patterns and the speed of them is determined by the music
[1:21:52] <%GoldeNOVA> The game actually gives you some leeway, you don't have to be spot on the beat.
[1:21:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:21:53] <%mostundesired> Played yourself.
[1:21:53] <+TehBeerBaron> Just count 1, 2, 3, 4, over and over until you don't need to count anymore

[1:21:55] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:21:56] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat I just want you to know that listening to you count 1234 made me nostalgiac for my piano lessons. Also length has nothing to do with it. It's much more binary.

[1:23:13] <sjcodan> THIS IS like watching you solve a crossword in SPANISH
[1:23:14] <Nina96> OH THE FAN ART FOR THIS
[1:23:14] <pimpinahz> yes
[1:23:14] <StromkoPenguin> Sense of rhythm is a skill you develop, people that learned it intuitively don't know how and give bad advice for those who didn't.
[1:23:14] <NumberTooBig> play baby mode pat
[1:23:14] <%Hilleltaco> This is like ear blindness
[1:23:14] <+Haarute> Yes.
[1:23:15] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat You are literally saying you are just copying human sounds without an understanding of them
[1:23:15] <%TeraMercier> This isn't crazy, Pat's just a philistine
[1:23:15] <%Tucker0603> YES
[1:23:16] <+Anonylesssss> WAY WORSE
[1:23:16] <%omegasis> pat's deafness
[1:23:16] <Saltmeisterr> BUT WORSE
[1:23:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you're a visual learner, maybe bring up some actual sheet music?
[1:23:18] <lizard0tm> Pat is rhythm blind
[1:23:20] <televisedrevolting> YES.
[1:23:20] <%GrayMatterMiner> this is your shadow puzzle
[1:23:21] <sjcodan> WORSE
[1:23:21] <%spiritofmojave> Pat is rhythm/sound
[1:23:21] <+Antoids> chat is just explaining it stupid
[1:23:22] <KatabolicRage> I dunno, some people don't get music on even a fundemental level, I don't think it's that unusual to know nothing about the subject
[1:23:22] <zedravan> this is worse she is disabled
[1:23:22] <$eldrich_horror> so pat doesnt learn stuff or understand stuff. just copies things and doesnt know why
[1:23:24] <Ion_Laser> but worse? HOLY SHIT
[1:23:24] <emillionghost> its WORSE
[1:23:25] <Desertfishing> Pat has no beat
[1:23:25] <%graffitisamurai> Even worse
[1:23:28] <%galaxyswirl> ITS WORSE
[1:23:32] <%CuddlyZombie> @angriestpat your timing is fine but bard is still really useful as a learning thing it’s not babymode
[1:23:33] <DocMadfox> I'm trying to help him with the visuals but he's not reading the message
[1:23:33] <sjcodan> BIG WORSE
[1:23:34] <narusao> see, you got the golems down
[1:23:37] <Nina96> @AngriestPat at least paige knows shes bblind
[1:23:38] <+WoolieTHEpieTHIEF1> my god you use rhythm in a rhythm game :(
[1:23:39] <Cymen90> it is WORSE
[1:23:40] <televisedrevolting> Pat has no sense of goddamn rhythm apparently.
[1:23:41] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you're a visual learner, maybe bring up some actual sheet music? If nothing else, we might be able to explain some stuff
[1:23:42] <+Quarkee> this is genuinely difficult to watch because i feel so bad for you it hurts my soul
[1:23:42] <DocMadfox> Someone PM him or something oh god
[1:23:43] <+Haarute> Pat close your eyes and try to follow the beat you see at the bottom of the screen. This becomes a feel you get.
[1:23:44] <%Typhaeon> Maybe look at the background when you have a streak, the red and blue/green checkerboard pattern, to help visualize it
[1:23:44] <%CuddlyZombie> Pats keeping the beat fine
[1:23:46] <pimpinahz> WE STILL LIKE YA PAT... YOU RYTHMLESS GINGER DAD lol
[1:23:46] <%astropupp> good goleming yes
[1:23:46] <aimlesshealer> This is like that one puzzle in Portal 2 where Paige solved it and then immediately forgot how to solve it
[1:23:48] <%rytyoung> And Bard is actually really fun
[1:23:49] <lizard0tm> People that have no rhythm are usually the worst kind of people
[1:23:52] <SunsetJack> Ehhh, people are exaggerating lol..
[1:23:52] <%mostundesired> It's not, it's the fact that you don't get i after we explain it like you're three.
[1:23:57] <NickHatesSnow> It's worse because you clearly can do it
[1:23:58] <DigbyMayor> The visual cues are enough, he doesn't even look at them
[1:24:02] <%CuddlyZombie> Pat is doing a good job keeping the beat
[1:24:06] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat i've beaten an all zones run during the time youve been stuck in zone 2, cmon white boy

[1:24:08] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:24:12] <dalollypop> MADMAN
[1:24:15] <%mostundesired> Getting there.
[1:24:15] <%CuddlyZombie> Bard is still useful though
[1:24:16] <Triplicat> rapier boys.
[1:24:18] <%rubbishbinge> HE DOIN IT
[1:24:19] <%spiritofmojave> I think it's just upsetting, I can't maintain a consistent beat either so I relate in the pain seen here
[1:24:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you're a visual learner, maybe bring up some actual sheet music maybe? If nothing else, we might be able to explain some stuff
[1:24:24] <%rytyoung> @digbymayor I think he must do, it teaches you in the game about it
[1:24:24] <$ESP_ROOT> i dont understaaaand
[1:24:25] <+Antoids> perhaps the LP tax is exacerbating the issue somewhat, because when you ignored chat just now, you did a lot better
[1:24:25] <Kalcom> rapier is so good

[1:24:40] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Deafening the music fucks people up.
[1:24:41] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Focus on the tiles around you. Every time they change that is a beat.
[1:24:42] <DocMadfox> Does he read messages under $5?
[1:24:42] <imbatman37> how could this be
[1:24:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat Because it muffles the music, making it harder to play the game
[1:24:48] <%TeraMercier> Pat, why do you even like this game if it's all about something you don't feel like you can understand?
[1:24:48] <sjcodan> the golem is 4x slower than you
[1:24:51] <NickHatesSnow> He's using gold at least

[1:25:06] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:25:06] <TranquilTurnip> I think Mother 3 would be pat's undoing, it has a LOT of consumables and the battles are often musically related
[1:25:11] <lizard0tm> Where are the fellow musicians at? Tweet this man some shit to help him learn rhythm at least a bit!
[1:25:26] <%CuddlyZombie> Pats rhythm is FINE

[1:25:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> 死
[1:25:31] <%spiritofmojave> I think if you use the visual cues for rhythm change more that'd help moreso than the beat timing

[1:25:41] <%ThePuddingDead> its like playing ddr on a controller
[1:25:42] <reonome> he doin it
[1:25:43] <TranquilTurnip> Pat can do Rhythm, he just doesn't understand it
[1:25:45] <%TeraMercier> @cureneckbeard There's macros for those, but isn't it a pretty weird thing to say it like that instead of just binding it to a button?
[1:25:46] <%ThePuddingDead> yep that is a thing
[1:25:47] <RoboXGP> getting hot and heavy
[1:25:47] <sjcodan> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[1:25:48] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[1:25:49] <DeathByPoke7> he had big healths
[1:25:51] <Nina96> he had it for a sec...
[1:25:55] <%Typhaeon> The large armadillo doesn't have wakeup recovery frames
[1:25:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Press RB to resurrect with the Dragon's Heritage
[1:26:01] <%CuddlyZombie> you’re doing well
[1:26:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat out of curiosity, can you tell the difference between 4/4 Timing ie this music and 3/4 ie a Waltz?
[1:26:03] <DocMadfox> NO! No you do not!
[1:26:04] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat you can do it, you just don't understand it
[1:26:04] <$rdark_ksu> meh if it works it works
[1:26:04] <DigbyMayor> It works better on arrow keys
[1:26:04] <Innocuous_Goat> Yeah. That's what feeling the rhythm is
[1:26:05] <King_Krimzon> No you don't
[1:26:06] <%brickwall35> Pat the game is about beat
[1:26:06] <Kalcom> while true, you are still bad
[1:26:07] <%ThePuddingDead> no, thats you
[1:26:07] <+conradical> i like the idea of this game, i just wish i liked roguelikes
[1:26:08] <sjcodan> ????
[1:26:11] <+Antoids> you are doing it instinctively, focusing on it makes you choke
[1:26:12] <%fallen92x> you do you pat
[1:26:12] <sjcodan> BIG ?????
[1:26:13] <lizard0tm> But you don't and it isn't
[1:26:13] <%Typhaeon> You don't actually need to consciously understand it if you can internalize the concept
[1:26:13] <CptBritches> That's natural rhythm taking over
[1:26:14] <pimpinahz> that's cuz you are reading Patterns,
[1:26:14] <Nina96> @AngriestPat yeah cause u start leaning beats without realizing it
[1:26:14] <NickHatesSnow> ...
[1:26:16] <RoboXGP> 5/6 timing
[1:26:16] <+Sxy_T_Rex> so go to baby mode baby
[1:26:16] <Saltmeisterr> ITS NOT THO
[1:26:16] <natebud> It's subconscious Pat.
[1:26:17] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:26:17] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat that's probably because the beats are more something you intuit, rather than consciously thinking about
[1:26:20] <j3xtrom> then just play bard
[1:26:20] <televisedrevolting> This game revolves around the goddamn beat, Pat.
[1:26:22] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat And you'll never get better winging it without understanding
[1:26:22] <%astropupp> it can def be subconscious
[1:26:23] <AtlasMcCoy> You're the epitome of needlessly complicated
[1:26:23] <Kalcom> crazy talko
[1:26:24] <%Tearonex> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:26:24] <SunsetJack> So why didn't you pick up the black chest before anyway?
[1:26:24] <%Ponch65> apatCrazy
[1:26:24] <Novillion> You're needlessly complicarted
[1:26:28] <$cureneckbeard> naruhodo.
[1:26:29] <Rhinoprotoss> It's like music
[1:26:30] <NickHatesSnow> Just use the BArd
[1:26:30] <+cgmerryo> i mean most people just intuitively understand beats
[1:26:33] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat People are making it sound more complicated than it is, you can just focus on the beat or the bars on the bottom.
[1:26:33] <RoboXGP> this is 8 beats
[1:26:33] <NumberTooBig> thats what ive been saying, rhythm is intuitive, not even worth thinking about if you have rhythm
[1:26:34] <+MisterMusashi> "The main feature of the game is needlessly complicated." - Pat sbfpSetIn
[1:26:35] <DocMadfox> I'm going to get banned from chat again trying to help him
[1:26:37] <$eldrich_horror> its not complicated at all tho
[1:26:42] <%Dr_DangerPhD> When you ignore the bedrock mechanic of the entire game of course its going to seem complicated
[1:26:46] <redial_nick> dude just go ultra instinct
[1:26:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you're a visual learner, maybe bring up some actual sheet music maybe? If nothing else, we might be able to explain some stuff
[1:26:52] <kimkimmehface> @angriestpat I’d re macro items & spells to the ABXY buttons. It helps a lot with keeping yourself alive & not missing beats.
[1:26:52] <NJigglypuff> if you got banned for chat for trying to help him then you were not ehlping
[1:26:52] <sjcodan> NO

[1:26:57] <AtlasMcCoy> PAT
[1:26:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> TO THE BEAT NotLikeTHis
[1:26:57] <natebud> He's actually getting into the rhythm but not realizing it. Dont tell him
[1:26:57] <+cgmerryo> by way of the beat
[1:26:57] <TranquilTurnip> I'm convinced that he can do it almost naturally, or on some level he understands, but when he tries to go out of his way to understand it, it confuses him and he does worse
[1:26:58] <%Typhaeon> Structured movement
[1:26:58] <reonome> PAT NO
[1:26:58] <EVOriginal> BIG WRONG
[1:26:59] <+Anonylesssss> ???
[1:26:59] <DocMadfox> It's moving around TO THE BEAT YOU FUCK

[1:27:04] <RoboXGP> 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and
[1:27:05] <pimpinahz> @angriestpat Pat. it's because you cant feel the beat so when you ignore it, you are reading Patterns instead. so do that, read the patterns
[1:27:05] <%ClutchRoadagain> Okay, this has to be bait.
[1:27:05] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis

[1:27:20] <$cureneckbeard> pat beat
[1:27:21] <%Typhaeon> Pat's problem is that he thinks he doesn't understand it, but he does
[1:27:21] <%CuddlyZombie> Pats right
[1:27:21] <televisedrevolting> It revolves around moving and acting to the fucking music, goddamn it.
[1:27:25] <%graffitisamurai> @angriestpat i'm 90% sure you actually are aware of rhythm...you just dont understand what that means
[1:27:28] <$eldrich_horror> its moving to the beat pat
[1:27:29] <%rubbishbinge> April foolishness, chat. April foolishness.
[1:27:29] <basswizard11> @AngriestPat the music is an auditory cue for when enemies will move and attack. its measured visually by the ticking lines on the heart
[1:27:30] <%GoldeNOVA> apatBig wrong
[1:27:31] <lizard0tm> Why must you be like this
[1:27:31] <%hawk_rush> @london_flexing this is the game that should have an easy mode /s
[1:27:34] <+fancypan> Thats why its called crypt of the necro mover
[1:27:39] <+cgmerryo> For real, ignore the beat look at it as a pattern
[1:27:40] <Nina96> @AngriestPat pat iam gonna kill myself at this rate plz stop
[1:27:40] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat Crypt of the Necrodancer, confirmed to be walking simulator
[1:27:41] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:27:42] <RoboXGP> 1 and 2 and
[1:27:45] <pimpinahz> @angriestpat tink big - Elvis Gratton LUL LUL instead of focusing on trying to feel the rythm of the beat, just read the patterns
[1:27:45] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat *** YOUR HEAD when do you decide to jump?
[1:27:46] <%NWR_James> You died
[1:27:46] <SunsetJack> Throwing the dagger can be a useful tool.
[1:27:48] <emillionghost> @AngriestPat you never had music in school?
[1:27:48] <sjcodan> @hawk_rush It has one
[1:27:48] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat If you really think that moving around is the main feature, why don't you just play a different game instead?
[1:27:51] <+swagocrates> lmao
[1:27:52] <%ThePuddingDead> i wont get mad
[1:27:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm surprised there's still anyone left that doesn't know Pat as a strange freakazoid goblin man instead of a normal human being lol

[1:28:18] <NickHatesSnow> @AngriestPat Try Bard maybe?
[1:28:20] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat out of curiosity, can you tell the difference between 4/4 Timing ie this music and 3/4 ie a Waltz?
[1:28:20] <al0nem0nster> maybe explain it in terms of devil may cry combos

[1:28:27] <%spiritofmojave> no shame in just trying out BRD
[1:28:28] <DocMadfox> Jesus I just realized Pat's as broken as Paige.
[1:28:28] <televisedrevolting> Call the Paige of Mustard.

[1:29:08] <Kalcom> just play bard
[1:29:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I've never played Risk of Rain. Oh no... is it a roguelike? It is, isn't it?
[1:29:14] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.

[1:29:16] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @nerdblase are you my piano teacher?
[1:29:18] <+Sxy_T_Rex> This game is not respecting your timing as a gamer

Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.
[1:29:48] <NumberTooBig> use baby mode @AngriestPat
[1:29:48] <Kalcom> because he can't advance
[1:29:49] <sjcodan> BARD
[1:29:49] <%schlager087> big oof
[1:29:53] <EVOriginal> I mean, you could be on the colored or non-colored rocks. Same beat @AngriestPat
[1:29:55] <%ECRead> That's what the beat is, Pat
[1:29:55] <DocMadfox> Fuck it, he's not listening
[1:29:56] <$cureneckbeard> Risk of Rain 1 is a roguelike platformer where the enemies get tougher over time, I think Risk of Rain 2 is 3D
[1:29:56] <Kalcom> that's why im mad
[1:29:57] <Laicuss> pat you are being a genuine boomer rn
[1:29:57] <+MisterMusashi> Bard please.
[1:29:58] <DocMadfox> It's almost over
[1:29:58] <RoboXGP> that guy moves every 1 and 2
[1:29:59] <+matrixManipulator> bard pls
[1:30:00] <$eldrich_horror> and the ground is changing with what? thats right the beat
[1:30:01] <%CuddlyZombie> Bard
[1:30:03] <%brickwall35> Has anyone ever been more deserving to be told to uninstall?
[1:30:06] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Wait, so you are deciding when to jump by visuals?
[1:30:07] <%graffitisamurai> Thats literally a visualization of the beat
[1:30:09] <sjcodan> BARD UP
[1:30:12] <DocMadfox> Stay strong Doc, stay strong for Emlo
[1:30:18] <NumberTooBig> @brickwall35 DSP for fighting games
[1:30:24] <NickHatesSnow> Bard time is now
[1:30:27] <worldbrand> oh he knows how the game works, he just doesn't understand time signatures. and there's no real need to
[1:30:30] <al0nem0nster> so pat's problem isn't beat, it seems to be directly bum rushing enemies
[1:30:33] <%PlainSimpleTailor> At what point can we say that the saturation of Roguelikes has reached Cancer level?
[1:30:40] <pimpinahz> For a guy good in reading Patterns like in Dank Souls.. he sure is having trouble reading these patterns

[1:30:45] <Rytmalfunction> Pat, impatient and agressive? No way
[1:30:49] <%ClutchRoadagain> Has Pat been too busy looking at the flashing colors to notice the enemy patterns?
[1:30:56] <$eldrich_horror> so are we just saying hes bad now?
[1:31:02] <%ClutchRoadagain> yes

[1:32:09] <Sitromxe> @al0nem0nster He's problem is that he is looking at his character controlled by his jank-ass sense of rhythm and not accounting for the beat that the monsters are operating off.
[1:32:10] <DocMadfox> He';s unconciously doing what I was trying to get him to do
[1:32:16] <lloyddboy> 1

[1:32:24] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I doubt you'll see this, but don't think of it as beats in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Think of it as rounds in DnD. Every time the line hits the heart/thechecker pattern on the ground changes, a round happens. Every fourth round the golem attacks, you're meant to move when the round happens.

[1:43:33] <SunsetJack> Wait really? All I had was playing the dumb flute.
[1:43:35] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat is it possible that you have no internal sense of rhythm due to the red bulls stopping your heart

[1:43:44] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> For what it's worth, I have a terrible time with keeping a beat as well
[1:43:46] <Rhinoprotoss> The heck are you doing
[1:43:49] <%GrayMatterMiner> the main thing is pattern recognition and keeping track of where you are in the pattern, less specifics of beat and music @AngriestPat
[1:43:50] <%TeraMercier> The lesson is that Pat gives up with music before he could get enough practice to learn
[1:43:51] <%spiritofmojave> @this_is_marco it really is the worst human object

[1:45:16] <DocMadfox> (Please don't do that, I don't want responsibilities)
[1:45:16] <Saltmeisterr> ok so whats special about risk of rain
[1:45:17] <Fujiwara_92> might rain
[1:45:17] <ScreamingMeat> Now for The Goblins Summoner
[1:45:19] <Ner234> Another SourPls game
[1:45:19] <@SSaryn> Oh boi dont do that.
[1:45:20] <$nademonkey1100> does moobot still hat if we yell
[1:45:22] <+InstiGaitan> Risk of Heavy Rain
[1:45:24] <sjcodan> Right way to play
[1:45:26] <ancrest_tant> I write music for a living
[1:45:27] <%ArcanumMBD> fight to the death for 3 people to get into the lobby
[1:45:27] <%ThePuddingDead> i never found an interest in the first one
[1:45:27] <aimlesshealer> @DocMadfox you didn't save him from shit, dude
[1:45:28] <@SSaryn> Yes
[1:45:28] <SunsetJack> Yea...
[1:45:29] <%Spydurman> yes
[1:45:29] <$Jayson12678> Boop
[1:45:30] <sjcodan> Its how its MEANT to be played
[1:45:30] <+NoKingArthur> There are more chests to go around
[1:45:32] <tomdwarf> The game drops more on multiplayer
[1:45:32] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat So that they can grief you obviously.
[1:45:32] <%meowmeow7t> its meant for co op
[1:45:32] <%Spydurman> Single Player is better
[1:45:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> Why do you think?
[1:45:33] <+LegendaryButcher> LUL
[1:45:33] <%rytyoung> it helps with clearing runs
[1:45:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> it makes it easier
[1:45:34] <Fujiwara_92> yeah
[1:45:34] <reonome> items are scaled pat
[1:45:35] <%GrayMatterMiner> big greed for big solo
[1:45:37] <+Despera__> It's way better multipklayer tho
[1:45:37] <sjcodan> FUCK YOU
[1:45:37] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat more items spawn in the first place
[1:45:38] <lizard0tm> Pat is such a baby
[1:45:38] <+JavaManJoJo> More chests spawn
[1:45:39] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[1:45:41] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat RoR's REAL experience is the MP
[1:45:42] <%SaltyDongs> Play with me plz
[1:45:43] <Saltmeisterr> multiplayer makes this game way better
[1:45:44] <+ShakeNDake> i love how thats the deal breaker, lol
[1:45:46] <NumberTooBig> Risk of Rain is a multiplayer game like borderlands
[1:45:47] <%Spydurman> fuck co op
[1:45:48] <LegendaryDorkKnight> cant play multiplayer cus no.friends
[1:45:49] <%meowmeow7t> the games harder otherwise even with more items
[1:45:50] <flubber3d> i thought you could turn off sharing
[1:45:51] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Playing solo means getting shot in the back a whole bunch
[1:45:52] <tomdwarf> Items are scaled, the game drops more than you would actually earn on a single player run
[1:45:53] <%bluemorning104> @AngriestPat it spawns more chests based on players, everything's first come first serve except boss loot, which everyone alive should get
[1:45:53] <+Quarkee> more items you idiot
[1:45:53] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat so you get the choicest picks for what synergises with you class
[1:46:00] <@SSaryn> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[1:46:00] <NumberTooBig> you tolerate the greed for more loot

[1:47:07] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Dancing is for cowards
[1:47:13] <lejeune> babbbbyyy
[1:47:14] <%bluemorning104> @doc_ock_rokc it spawns one for every player, if you seriously grab more than 1 and no one's dead, you're a dickhead
[1:47:14] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat before i forget, this game also has a rhythm mechanic... good luck LUL

[1:47:51] <lejeune> ew
[1:47:51] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat you share items but more items spawn in the first place, and some items are much better on some characters so if somebody finds an item thats good for you and not them, they'll mark it for you and leave it alone

[1:48:32] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Hey dude, you enjoy this more than the first? I know the first Risk of Rain wasn't your thing.
[1:48:32] <sileo_patronus> Elmo Screams At

[1:49:20] <nobknee> I just came 'round, does he enjoy Risk of Rain 2 alright?
[1:49:21] <aimlesshealer> He does?
[1:49:24] <oAznoUta> this is actually kind of completely different from the first RoR anyway
[1:49:24] <sappinmahbinyot> Multiplayer is hard
[1:49:25] <@SSaryn> Does he?
[1:49:27] <al0nem0nster> actually i wonder if Elmo would play that ninja fruit game.
[1:49:27] <+Grayhammatter> just play with elmo

[1:49:30] <%deathscythe122887> @AngriestPat So which character is your favorite in Risk Of Rain 1 and 2?
[1:49:35] <%bluemorning104> @doc_ock_rokc yep, if you're gonna be a dick you deserve it. the only "first come first serve" with the boss items is if a yellow spawns, if you're swiping greens from people then you deserve to get fucked
[1:49:39] <Dementedpenguin> @nobknee hasn't started yet
[1:49:41] <@SSaryn> Does he know how to play Bloodborne better than us?
[1:49:41] <DocMadfox> I'm mostly here to see what Risk of Rain 2 actually is. My friend plays it
[1:49:41] <%Gatzarlok> Elmo Carry pat.

[1:50:17] <%R0bobot> MULT-T best
[1:50:19] <@SSaryn> To be fair, you can get like 2 characters rather easily in 2 hours or so
[1:50:19] <%rytyoung> solid choice, but your only choice
[1:50:22] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat I got Risk of Rain pro tips for ya if you need em. Just remember to keep moving, difficulty ranks up fast
[1:50:25] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Multiplayer is good for new players, because of all of the helpful and friendly anons helping you through the game.

[1:50:41] <Dementedpenguin> @mastertwin2 watching chat get furious was goddamn hilarious.
[1:50:43] <SunsetJack> Commando probably is the best hit proc currently. Mul-T doesn't count cause his nailgun has a penalty on procs.

[1:52:12] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You're not wrong he did just draw it.But he used more steps than you though.

[1:52:15] <Desertfishing> piece by piece is the only way something can be made
[1:52:15] <%GrayMatterMiner> only the insane people, and even THEY follow a rhythm @AngriestPat
[1:52:15] <+AmanDotZip> Something like that youd learn lightning fast by actually practicing it
[1:52:16] <SweetCuppingCake> I mean, you can. But I think it's more common to sketch things out first to figure out what you wanna do
[1:52:16] <$afronooch> LUL
[1:52:16] <%rubbishbinge> I tried drawing. It's hard. Ya gotta make a cheat layer and trace it :(

[1:52:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I for one plan my talking ahead of time
[1:52:32] <+Nexoosen> honestly, might be a good idea to play on the easier difficulti for a run, found by removing a bit of the challenge people learn the mechanics quicker, it also helps unlock characters/items easier
[1:52:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> When you talk, you just string together words.
[1:52:33] <nobknee> yeah, just talk it
[1:52:33] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat money does NOT carry over from level to level spend what you got

[1:58:50] <+Nexoosen> The most important tip i can think of, is try to be time to item efficient, going to the nexr level skips forward a little in the difficulty tracker, making it usually better to clear out most of the stuff on your current level before moving on, not sure if that will help though, have fun, stay big

[2:00:30] <%HiroTSK5> Me and my boss got tipped once with a coupon for a pound of See's Chocolate. It was nice
[2:00:30] <+djinnJuice> the reason they don't want you to accept tips is because the tax implications, if they say not to do it and you do it, they've covered their ass
[2:00:32] <%rubbishbinge> flashbacks
[2:00:35] <%R0bobot> Pat, we need you to come in
[2:00:38] <%ECRead> I got tipped today with free Chick Fil A sandwich coupons today. so that was rad.
[2:00:38] <%Typhaeon> The supermarket was Pat's 'Nam
[2:00:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GET OUT OF RETAIL FOLKS
[2:00:40] <Parapattern> Always give tips as cash directly to the person, don't write them down as part of a credit card charge
[2:00:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat We ll have first job PTSD

[2:02:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> Check the gallery first
[2:02:12] <extradopeness> Its really good tho
[2:02:12] <Kalcom> too high
[2:02:14] <+moondog_> it's as loud as you are short. which is very
[2:02:16] <%R0bobot> 50%
[2:02:16] <Parapattern> This is pretty good menu music
[2:02:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> sounds good
[2:02:17] <lejeune> paaaat
[2:02:19] <GPAlpha> Keep the music up somewhat, since it's really good
[2:02:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> Check the gallery tho
[2:02:19] <+ashkuyo> music is loud. mute yourself pls

[2:02:26] <%ClutchRoadagain> Still too loud
[2:02:26] <Kalcom> no it loud
[2:02:27] <+Estuko> How's RoR2 ? I've heard of one and seen a little but never really paid much attention, looks like I missed out.
[2:02:27] <+smevvster> Just note the game's been in early access for less than a week, so it's not exactly "perfect"
[2:02:28] <$shurtal> that floofy boy is TOO GOOD
[2:02:31] <sappinmahbinyot> The characters in the game kinda fit in their own archetypes. Commando is the all-rounder who gets better as you unlock more items, Huntress is the easy to play character who kinda scales poorly on normal difficulty due to her sub-par damage per second and proc chances, MUL-T is the overpowered arsenal tank, Engineer is broken but is slow to start and Mercenary is very hard to play but comes with a great reward.
[2:02:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Check those images
[2:02:33] <cirocomic> Still really loud
[2:02:34] <lejeune> no play the shooter with the controller

[2:03:02] <+moondog_> still pretty loud short man
[2:03:10] <BlacSoul> Which one has the sword?
[2:03:11] <SunsetJack> Challenge unlocks new items and characters.
[2:03:15] <+YourNastyBoy> the engineer is still an all around beast
[2:03:18] <BlacSoul> That will be my main
[2:03:20] <+Estuko> Lizard man type characters are cute
[2:03:20] <sappinmahbinyot> @BlacSoul mercenary
[2:03:22] <Sitromxe> So this game is 3d right? And the original was 2d? That's a big change, does it play well?
[2:03:23] <BoBoCatBurger> Acrid best boy 4eva
[2:03:24] <%spiritofmojave> Never have played Risk of Rain, is that a lizard man
[2:03:24] <Ion_Laser> still loud
[2:03:25] <emillionghost> loud
[2:03:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> My game crashes when I exit the logbook
[2:03:32] <Sunditsu> maybe a little bit
[2:03:34] <%rytyoung> @sitromxe yup
[2:03:36] <%deathscythe122887> Hey chat who do you think he will like more Mercenary, Engineer, or the caster?
[2:03:36] <+ashkuyo> perfect
[2:03:37] <BlacSoul> @sappinmahbinyot Ty
[2:03:38] <+YourNastyBoy> music down a little
[2:03:38] <sappinmahbinyot> @TheSpiritof2277 yes, they're called lemurs.
[2:03:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YourNastyBoy engie or Mul-t are the strongest
[2:03:39] <Deano8817> that'll do
[2:03:41] <starotter70> Perfect
[2:03:41] <Parapattern> I preferred the pixel style of the first one, tbh
[2:03:44] <%Piemen99> GOOD-
[2:03:44] <%Spydurman> good
[2:03:45] <+JavaManJoJo> crank it up 200%
[2:03:47] <+Grayhammatter> that'll do
[2:03:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Parapattern Same
[2:03:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> It locks up the pc too. Have to do a total restart
[2:03:54] <+moondog_> good enough I guess
[2:03:54] <flubber3d> I'm feeling 29% instead
[2:03:55] <lizard0tm> It's good
[2:03:56] <%rytyoung> @sitromxe no clue how the sequel plays, waiting for it to be ported to console
[2:03:57] <+SolverCODO> loudest fuckin song

[2:04:08] <%FrustratedAF> @Kirby_Sauce hey heard you been doin some weird shit in the donations and bits
[2:04:09] <Sunditsu> I think its just the music
[2:04:09] <al0nem0nster> RoRT
[2:04:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat the music is amazing
[2:04:12] <Fujiwara_92> good
[2:04:14] <sileo_patronus> May need to kick music down separately so you don'tt kill the SFX @AngriestPat
[2:04:16] <natebud> I have 268 hours in risk of rain 1...
[2:04:17] <emillionghost> good
[2:04:18] <%ThePuddingDead> i mean its a good song, but jesus
[2:04:18] <%GoldeNOVA> Risk of Rain 1 had amazing music, hope this has it too
[2:04:19] <SunsetJack> GO Drizzel
[2:04:22] <foreverN2dust> @Parapattern I like both. I feel like this one retains the style pretty well for a 3d adaptation
[2:04:23] <%ECRead> @aimlesshealer good to know! not that I think it'll be a problem anyway since the guy who gave em to me was the owner of the one right around the corner from my work doodGood
[2:04:24] <+Grayhammatter> do the drizzle
[2:04:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Why not reduce the music sound to 75%?
[2:04:28] <+YourNastyBoy> sometimes i just start a game just to listen to the music
[2:04:31] <%rytyoung> @natebud same lul
[2:04:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> @FrustratedAF that's what I do, yes
[2:04:33] <Cymen90> WAIT WHAT
[2:04:35] <+SolverCODO> Thank god, that title music is awful and so loud
[2:04:37] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> time for solo commando
[2:04:38] <%tiishi> what is this game? i have never seen it
[2:04:39] <%NWR_James> This is going to go well
[2:04:40] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> aka
[2:04:43] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> hell
[2:04:44] <%ThePuddingDead> so whats the point of the game? whats the goal?
[2:04:46] <%rytyoung> here we goo
[2:04:49] <Kalcom> useyour items
[2:04:49] <sappinmahbinyot> @tiishi Risk of Rain 2
[2:04:50] <Cymen90> I didn't know they went 3D for the sequel!
[2:04:51] <starotter70> "Drop your volume...perfect!"
[2:04:58] <extradopeness> Yup that's a Risk of Rain
[2:04:58] <BlacSoul> Get huge
[2:04:59] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @ThePuddingDead escape
[2:04:59] <Triplicat> I can already tell this looks fine
[2:05:00] <+YourNastyBoy> @ThePuddingDead there isn't one really yet it's just survive for now
[2:05:05] <%ThePuddingDead> hmm
[2:05:07] <+JavaManJoJo> @ThePuddingDead The first game had an end to it, but RoR2 doesn't have it yet
[2:05:07] <lejeune> hell yeah @Cymen90
[2:05:07] <%Smuggeau> Smuggeau subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:05:08] <%rytyoung> @cymen90 I did the exact same reaction too bro
[2:05:10] <%skizzuto> goal of this game is to find a teleporter to the next level, survive waves of enemies
[2:05:11] <+Estuko> @ThePuddingDead seemsl ike a gauntlet kinda? survive through challenges?
[2:05:15] <%Mythicalbrit> There is a guide on steam to unlock all the characters by messing with some files if you want to give em a try
[2:05:17] <@Mechz71> You just gonna not explain the game Pat @AngriestPat
[2:05:24] <NumberTooBig> @ThePuddingDead is there a goal in life, a purpose... the answer is loot and cash money
[2:05:25] <%ECRead> i never actually played Risk of Rain. this is charming
[2:05:26] <Triplicat> if the objective flow is exactly the same as RoR1
[2:05:32] <Triplicat> this game will be just fine
[2:05:37] <al0nem0nster> drop in, no explanation, no time, just play roguelike
[2:05:37] <%ThePuddingDead> @NumberTooBig you aint wrong
[2:05:38] <+Sxy_T_Rex> gasoline rules
[2:05:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Triplicat It is but in 3d
[2:05:53] <Triplicat> awesome
[2:05:57] <%rytyoung> @ecread it's a very good game, cheap too
[2:05:57] <SunsetJack> Except you can't open chest outside of the teleporter field event which is new.
[2:05:58] <%nmaten> the best commentary
[2:06:08] <starotter70> I understand
[2:06:09] <Triplicat> can't wait for it to exit early access on principle then
[2:06:11] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat What's the goal of this game?
[2:06:13] <+SolverCODO> souka
[2:06:15] <al0nem0nster> digging the scenery, kindof reminding me of collosus at the moment
[2:06:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Is the only objective in this game is to loot and survive?
[2:06:18] <%bevyrage> woah shit this is risk of rain 2?
[2:06:20] <+YourNastyBoy> why does the huntress have a fat ass 🤔

[2:06:27] <+Nexoosen> there's an orange particle effect above the teleporter that'll help you spot the exit freom far away
[2:06:28] <extradopeness> Its a roguelike
[2:06:28] <TheHeroAppears> did I come in time for first run?
[2:06:29] <natebud> I wonder what they did to huntress, her best skill was being able to move and shoot, but now everyone does that.
[2:06:31] <%HiroTSK5> Procedurally Generated?

[2:06:49] <%Reaped_Psyche> Nail on head
[2:06:51] <%GrayMatterMiner> pretty on point
[2:06:53] <%BioApple> the goal of the game is to collect items until the sheer amount of effects causes your game to crash
[2:06:56] <+d00msdaydan> hey look engineer fungus
[2:06:56] <SunsetJack> Rolling has invul frames which can be use to negate fall damage.

[2:07:09] <+Estuko> ohh shit that looks awesome
[2:07:10] <CptBritches> The goal of the game is to stack items until you fly out of the fucking map

[2:07:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat seriously try multiplayer
[2:07:52] <+Nexoosen> If you are behind the beetle queen she often does a shittier debuff attack
[2:07:54] <ameraaaaaa> what happened
[2:07:55] <+Estuko> so, GET BIG seems to be the name of the game
[2:07:57] <CptBritches> Well, it's not a cakewalk, but you can pretty quickly get to the point where you are getting to the last area every run
[2:07:58] <+ShakeNDake> FYI, i dont think there is invincibility on the roll
[2:07:59] <Sitromxe> And multiplayer would make this harder?

[2:08:15] <+cgmerryo> don't go as fast as possible, get items
[2:08:16] <Onamar> EFFICIENT not fast
[2:08:16] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat maximise loot vs time efficiency
[2:08:16] <CptBritches> No, STACK ITEMS, stack items until you tear the game asunder
[2:08:17] <%meowmeow7t> @AngriestPat Pat you don't have to be that close to the bosses or any enemies in general
[2:08:17] <+trashamn> ITEMS
[2:08:17] <%XeroVI> wrong
[2:08:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> GET ITEMS
[2:08:19] <lloyddboy> WHO'S LYING?
[2:08:19] <natebud> Try to open as many chests as you can before you go for the teleporter. Items are essential @AngriestPat
[2:08:19] <foreverN2dust> 1. equip yourself for boss 2. kill boss
[2:08:20] <SunsetJack> Kinda.
[2:08:20] <Ner234> There's a balance
[2:08:21] <+trashamn> LEVEL UP
[2:08:22] <%GoldeNOVA> LOOT EVERYTHING
[2:08:23] <2joe90> The strategy is to find a balance of speed and items
[2:08:23] <%XeroVI> stack items
[2:08:23] <%Laecerelius> Gotta do a balance of killing and getting items and then hitting teleporter
[2:08:24] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Someone is screwing with you.
[2:08:25] <MormonFreeman> That only applies to the first game
[2:08:25] <sambone_z> farm each level to collect gold enough to collect all the items
[2:08:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG GRIND
[2:08:26] <sileo_patronus> Go as fast as SUSTAINABLY possible
[2:08:26] <$StarlitStunner> tomatoBWL tomatoBWL tomatoBWL
[2:08:26] <eyedol33> Once youre good maybe
[2:08:26] <%Spydurman> Get as many items as possible
[2:08:27] <+cement_addiction> get EVERYTHING first
[2:08:27] <qwaar37> RoR1 yes, go through as fast as possible, RoR2, fuck no
[2:08:28] <+Silentman0> try not dying
[2:08:28] <lloyddboy> GOTTA SCHLOOT
[2:08:29] <Fordlotus> WHO SAID THAT ?!
[2:08:30] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat since you haven't played this game much you should take it slow to learn the items and mechanics
[2:08:31] <Ner234> Go fast but you still need items.
[2:08:33] <+Haarute> The game does get more difficult with time, but you -need- to manage a good number of items to stand a chance.
[2:08:33] <sukiyakiwestern> that applied to risk of rain 1, not 2
[2:08:33] <Yeajow> Play fast dont move on fast
[2:08:33] <%Niney_Who> Be as EFFICIENT as possible
[2:08:34] <TSUKl> Get all the items on the level as fast as possible, then boss
[2:08:34] <+theKingRamses> you got to keep an eye on that difficulty slider moving
[2:08:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Yes that is technically true but you also need items to survive
[2:08:35] <+BurkeBigsby> *Be efficient"
[2:08:35] <CptBritches> You can stack items to RIDICULOUS effects
[2:08:35] <sirrice77> you need to go as fast as you can but also get loot
[2:08:38] <BoBoCatBurger> @angriestpat balance farming for items and speed
[2:08:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> SCRAPE THE MAP
[2:08:38] <+Ace5335> Grab all the loot and than boss
[2:08:39] <%street_sign> get loot but do it FAST
[2:08:39] <sukiyakiwestern> you need to get HUGE
[2:08:40] <SunsetJack> You need to balance out between getting items and then activating the teleport.
[2:08:42] <+cement_addiction> get EVERYTHING then do teleporter
[2:08:43] <%meowmeow7t> Play on DRIZZLE
[2:08:43] <+Grayhammatter> maximize the looter in your shooter
[2:08:43] <%velemi> Maximize movement speed for sure
[2:08:44] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat there is a guide on steam to unlock all the characters by messing with some files if you want to give em a try
[2:08:44] <%Spydurman> Items are the only real powerups
[2:08:45] <energywarning> get fast items to get items fast
[2:08:45] <tomdwarf> Go at a "brisk" pace. Grab all items you can find, go to tele quickly. Dont dawdle, or just stand still and grind.
[2:08:47] <lloyddboy> DO LOOT FAST
[2:08:48] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat it's all about choices. Do you fight the boss weaker to get the next stage faster, or take time to get jacked
[2:08:49] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> get items until you're powerful ***for the time you're at*** then fight the boss
[2:08:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> No
[2:08:50] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Someone chose the wrong word to say to pat
[2:08:50] <%Nope80808> NO DO IT
[2:08:51] <%nmaten> gotta go fast
[2:08:51] <eyedol33> nah
[2:08:51] <2joe90> Play on drizzle to get a grip of the mechanics, we won't judge
[2:08:52] <Fujiwara_92> be efficient, be e efficient
[2:08:52] <%Spydurman> yeah
[2:08:53] <$StarlitStunner> tomatoKnife stripSmart
[2:08:54] <%GoldeNOVA> Nah, it's fine
[2:08:55] <%rytyoung> @angriestpat you want to be efficiently looting the stages and getting out the level once done looting
[2:08:56] <Sunditsu> @AngriestPat I believe more enemies spawn the longer you take in a level
[2:08:57] <sambws> it's about finding the right pace
[2:08:57] <Kalcom> yes cause you need more items
[2:08:57] <%Laecerelius> Taking it super slow is horrible
[2:08:57] <SunsetJack> I recommend playing it on DRIZZLE difficulty to get use to the pace and learn to speed up.
[2:08:57] <%Niney_Who> You have to be Efficient and Clean
[2:08:57] <FirewallStorm> loot fast
[2:08:58] <+swagocrates> it gets harder the long you stay on a level
[2:08:58] <Ner234> Not quite but yeah
[2:08:59] <dsauce999> Man, who is this loser?
[2:08:59] <+trashamn> you have to manage your pace well
[2:08:59] <%Spydurman> medium pace
[2:09:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat yes
[2:09:00] <PhantaniumOG> Not really
[2:09:00] <%BioApple> honestly? play on the easy mode, you can go slower with less penalty
[2:09:00] <+notorious_rng> its always suicide no matter what
[2:09:00] <caol2017> get loot fast, not fast progression
[2:09:02] <+Ace5335> It's better than dying to the first boss
[2:09:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ButterscotchSoda) (warning)
[2:09:02] <+ashkuyo> its not about being fast it's about being EFFICIENT
[2:09:02] <%GrayMatterMiner> be efficient, not *fast*
[2:09:04] <sileo_patronus> Basically don't spend a shit-ton of time grinding for literally everything on the map @AngriestPat
[2:09:09] <starotter70> GO FAST NEVER STOP
[2:09:09] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat dont worry commando teaches you a lot of bad habits that will get broken when you play a real character
[2:09:10] <sukiyakiwestern> jump @ roll more
[2:09:11] <%Nope80808> Do it slow But do it good
[2:09:12] <+BurkeBigsby> You have to guage how much money you'll need for chests, and farm accordingly.
[2:09:13] <%Laecerelius> take too long and the enemies get too good compared to how much loot you've gotten
[2:09:13] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you might not get an hour long run if you take it slow, but you'll have a better time learning the game if you go slow
[2:09:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat the challege is finding the right pace
[2:09:14] <StaticSunrise> they totally lied to you
[2:09:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> If you go slow enough and scrape everything up, it can actually work out fine
[2:09:15] <%GoldeNOVA> @angriestpat Play on Drizzle for now, get the hang of the game
[2:09:16] <CptBritches> I mean, the difficulty does increase with time, but there's more than enough time to get items in a level
[2:09:17] <%BioApple> harder difficulties are for after you ahve some unlocks under your belt
[2:09:23] <Fujiwara_92> Don't play slow, but don't just rush it
[2:09:23] <Scyllas> Whens ps4?
[2:09:26] <sukiyakiwestern> only bad slow is 15 min on the first level slow
[2:09:26] <Novillion> Play fast but don't gun for the exit like a lemming
[2:09:26] <$cureneckbeard> Monsters get stronger over time, so you have to get all the stuff on the map but then the game is hard.
[2:09:29] <+Haarute> Use your roll for movement if not in combat.
[2:09:38] <+Nexoosen> You wanna be fast to clean up the items in a level and get outta there the moment you have, but just rushing through levels will leave you in a way shittier position than going too slow @AngriestPat
[2:09:41] <%rytyoung> @graymatterminer @angriestpat what this guy said, be an efficient looter
[2:09:45] <+Sxy_T_Rex> not moist at all
[2:09:50] <+Grayhammatter> it;s pretty clean
[2:09:51] <+sparkjavelin> i didnt even know there was a sequel to risk of rain
[2:09:51] <%TheShal> I came here to laugh at you
[2:09:51] <%XeroVI> get as much loot as you can, then take on the teleport when you think you're strong enough
[2:09:57] <%BioApple> RoR1 is like the cleanest game ever made (give or take a few thousand corpse sprites)
[2:10:00] <$StarlitStunner> tomatoCrust clean
[2:10:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat nice and wet
[2:10:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Clean... like a rock...
[2:10:06] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat dont forget that the game is super hard starting out because commando is by far the worst character
[2:10:07] <%deathscythe122887> @AngriestPat If you want to unlock the other characters real fast then play on easy easy
[2:10:08] <+d00msdaydan> the game has a nice clean look so you can filth it up with the billions of different passive effects you'll be stacking
[2:10:08] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat did you play the original 2S pixelart roguelike?
[2:10:11] <%Nope80808> Just pay attention to the timer above the sliding EASY BAR and go based on that
[2:10:15] <dsauce999> Pat likes his game like he likes his women, dry as a desert Keepo
[2:10:24] <Dementedpenguin> 30 minutes ago I didn't know Risk of Rain 2 existed. 1 minute ago, I didn't know Risk of Rain 2 was in 3D o_O

[2:11:39] <eyedol33> kill stuff mang
[2:11:39] <%ThePuddingDead> so does the name risk of rain come from surviving against the weather? i thought it meant like acid rain of some kind

[2:11:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Howdy, I’m back! What shenanigans has Pat been up to
[2:11:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @lewdskeletor13 when did you leave?
[2:12:00] <%Asagi66> Asagi66 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 3 more months for even grosser eye.
[2:12:02] <@SSaryn> Doin a big item get
[2:12:05] <%BioApple> @ThePuddingDead I think it's a reference to how all the item chests are canonically "raining" from the ship as it crashes

[2:12:23] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, a mountain
[2:12:23] <nobknee> @AngriestPat In Risk of Rain 1, you could zoom the camera in more to see your character more, but you'd see less of the battlefield, less enemies.
[2:12:23] <SunsetJack> You can roll the statue again if it is available at a higher price.
[2:12:24] <sukiyakiwestern> dont forger youe burst shot too
[2:12:24] <%ArcanumMBD> MOUNTAIN

[2:12:45] <Fujiwara_92> WELP
[2:12:45] <qwaar37> adds bosses to the tele
[2:12:45] <%XeroVI> f
[2:12:46] <%ArcanumMBD> Can't beat one boss, gonna get fucked by two
[2:12:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fiiiiiiiiiine
[2:12:47] <%deathscythe122887> @AngriestPat just think of the commando as gunslinger and later you can get V and Vergil in this game
[2:12:48] <%Nope80808> f
[2:12:49] <LoliLich> F
[2:12:49] <$rdark_ksu> you have to be like Chris and punch rocks
[2:12:49] <energywarning> yo dawg, i heard you like bosses so i put a boss on your boss
[2:12:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> monkaSSS
[2:12:50] <tomdwarf> Makes the boss harder, but will drop more rewards.
[2:12:50] <+cgmerryo> well
[2:12:51] <%rytyoung> coming down the mountaiiiiin
[2:12:51] <eyedol33> he dead now bois

[2:12:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Gotta fight that mountain now
[2:12:53] <+Grayhammatter> that's a big rip
[2:12:56] <Sunditsu> It'll be fiiiine chat
[2:12:59] <LodiFrostbeard> why did they have to go 3d?? 2d was perfect this looks like crap NotLikeThis
[2:12:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> monkaS
[2:13:01] <$StarlitStunner> tomatoGrease you hate to see it happen folks
[2:13:07] <+ashkuyo> let him learn from his terrible, terrible mistakes
[2:13:08] <%lewdskeletor13> The sentient mountain
[2:13:08] <nobknee> Also, givin' myself a pat on the back tonight, 'cause I finally got all the steam achievements for Risk of Rain 1 today.
[2:13:08] <@SSaryn> Might be Beetle Queen x2 and he'll be fine
[2:13:08] <%XeroVI> take out the wisps
[2:13:10] <Dementedpenguin> If Pat can be Sekiro, then he's fine.......... Kappa
[2:13:11] <+Estuko> @LodiFrostbeard this looks amazing
[2:13:11] <+Nexoosen> Shrine of the mountain gives you double end of level loot, but double bosses
[2:13:13] <+trashamn> 3D is kino
[2:13:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LodiFrostbeard yeah but people like 3d
[2:13:15] <Dementedpenguin> *beat
[2:13:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man this music is good
[2:13:25] <chadmongo> @AngriestPat Small tip bit when looking for the teleporter it helps to look for the glow it gives off
[2:13:25] <%rytyoung> @lodifrostbeard I think it looks amazing
[2:13:26] <T_Sasquatch> @LodiFrostbeard but its an improvement in everyway possible LUL, i literally only care about it now its 3d
[2:13:27] <%GoldeNOVA> Risk of Rain was already great, in 3D it just made it better
[2:13:28] <%skizzuto> those are elite mobs
[2:13:28] <GPAlpha> Elite enemies
[2:13:29] <%ArcanumMBD> Blazing 420 Beetles
[2:13:29] <+Grayhammatter> elites
[2:13:35] <+JavaManJoJo> Those guys are basically Eximus units from Warframe
[2:13:38] <TSUKl> @LodiFrostbeard are you blind my dude this game looks great
[2:13:38] <%PaladinDupre> I dont understand the appeal of this
[2:13:43] <@SSaryn> Elites start spawning, 3 different variations for each enemy
[2:13:44] <%lewdskeletor13> I was grooving to the Necrodancer music earlier, I miss it :(
[2:13:45] <%PaladinDupre> Heat Signature is better
[2:13:46] <zedravan> the level gets harder the more time you spent
[2:13:51] <nobknee> I enjoy Risk of Rain 1 and 2 equally.
[2:13:55] <al0nem0nster> ...I can't believe no one thought to use Octavia to explain necrodancer
[2:13:56] <LodiFrostbeard> looks like ass
[2:13:56] <@SSaryn> Not counting Reds that is
[2:13:56] <T_Sasquatch> @PaladinDupre shoot bang rogue like
[2:13:58] <sileo_patronus> @PaladinDupre it's the big number appeal
[2:13:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThatGuyfromMars Look up the soundtrack. Good doesn't discribe it
[2:14:04] <+theKingRamses> you can still use that money shrine from earlier if you can find it
[2:14:05] <+Grayhammatter> use the shrine of chance again
[2:14:07] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @al0nem0nster everyone just spams shift anyway
[2:14:07] <eyedol33> @PaladinDupre Thats also a very different game
[2:14:08] <%GoldeNOVA> Heat Signature is awesome, but RoR is great
[2:14:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @doc_ock_rokc hell yeah my dude
[2:14:10] <%rytyoung> If they made it into 2d again they wouldn't have to update visuals much
[2:14:10] <T_Sasquatch> do you not get new weapons ??
[2:14:14] <SunsetJack> Multiplayer is the biggest factor of this game.
[2:14:16] <Kalcom> the looks are good but I don't find why so many pepole were exited
[2:14:17] <natebud> On later levels you should be using your alts as soon as you get them back.
[2:14:20] <%lewdskeletor13> How different is this game from the first?
[2:14:24] <CptBritches> You can keep trying the shrine of chance until you get two items
[2:14:24] <%Straylightgg> Straylightgg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! I almost have the creepiest eyeball!
[2:14:25] <nobknee> Also, the look of it may improve, as it's gonna be in early access for about a year.
[2:14:26] <%Nope80808> PAt doesnt play octavia it wouldnt help
[2:14:26] <%BioApple> I like 1 more as of now just because 2 doesn't have artifacts or as many items yet
[2:14:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @PaladinDupre number go up, satisfying progression. If that's not for you then NBD, to each their own
[2:14:33] <%Hammerknife> like 90% of the appeal of this game is the co-op
[2:14:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Kalcom The gameplay of the first game was amazing
[2:14:38] <%rytyoung> @lewdskeletor13 very different, but some item effects are the same
[2:14:39] <%Hammerknife> kind of stale when solo
[2:14:41] <qwaar37> teleporter is in the pit under the bridge
[2:14:42] <@SSaryn> @lewdskeletor13 The 2D to 3D is major enough along with 2 new characters already.
[2:14:42] <dsauce999> MR Patsident, GET DOWN
[2:14:43] <+Grayhammatter> there is a secret area
[2:14:44] <%skizzuto> @T_Sasquatch weapons are character specific, the vast majority of items are passives
[2:14:44] <+Nexoosen> Look for the orange particle affect @AngriestPat
[2:14:48] <CptBritches> Look for fireflies in air, Pat
[2:14:48] <+smevvster> Look for orange fireflies. That means you're in it's vicinity
[2:14:49] <%Neryl_> CRAZY TALK
[2:14:49] <%Niney_Who> Crazy Talk
[2:14:50] <Parapattern> This seems like it'd be a lot harder to keep track of where you are compared to the first game.
[2:14:50] <TSUKl> look for the orange fireflies
[2:14:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> In the cave
[2:14:54] <foreverN2dust> crzy
[2:14:55] <CptBritches> Go back to the shrine of chance
[2:14:55] <Kalcom> okay what about this one
[2:14:56] <+DERGONS86> @AngriestPat look for smoke particles to find the teleporter
[2:14:56] <Ion_Laser> [ CRAZY TALK ]
[2:14:56] <%Tearonex> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:14:58] <%spiritofmojave> Coop and 3D are two major reasons I could see getting into this one
[2:14:58] <al0nem0nster> Crazy Talku
[2:14:59] <StaticSunrise> look for the particle effects, not the teleporter structure
[2:15:01] <%Niney_Who> Going in a circle again..
[2:15:01] <sukiyakiwestern> this is the most satisfying game about stacking procs and abilities ever
[2:15:02] <%lewdskeletor13> @rytyoung @ssaryn thanks guys apatDab
[2:15:04] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat Teleporter's hint is that it has red particle effects around it which is something I guess...
[2:15:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> in the cave
[2:15:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> TURN AROUND
[2:15:10] <@SSaryn> If you gain 2-4 items each level, you're fine, you need to keep going
[2:15:10] <%Tearonex> It's getting stronger guys
[2:15:10] <+ArtemisCroc> stop looking in the same spots then lmao
[2:15:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Stop retracing the same paths you've taken, you won't find new chests
[2:15:13] <%NeonTurnip> Pog risk of rain 2
[2:15:14] <T_Sasquatch> @skizzuto oof, i thought there would be weapon variety
[2:15:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @al0nem0nster People were too upset to think clearly I guess, it's easy to keep yelling the same thing and hope it'll go through than to think of new approaches
[2:15:17] <reonome> is he on the latest patch?
[2:15:20] <dsauce999> POGGERS
[2:15:21] <lizard0tm> Music reminds me of Mass Effect
[2:15:21] <+serranobros> there's limited chests pat, at this point you're just making it harder
[2:15:21] <LodiFrostbeard> this reminds me of nidhog 2 WutFace
[2:15:22] <+theKingRamses> there's the side of the map on the other side of that teleporter
[2:15:22] <natebud> 3d seems worth it just to see your character gain a ridiculous amount of stuff.
[2:15:24] <+Dycroma> i mean ther'ss the shrine
[2:15:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @reonome No idea
[2:15:27] <+Qsmash_> the backseating begins
[2:15:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Go to placs you haven't bn for chests to loot.... you going in a big circle
[2:15:33] <%GoldeNOVA> There's class and build variety, not weapon
[2:15:34] <sukiyakiwestern> prolly no more items
[2:15:34] <+Estuko> "re tras ing"
[2:15:37] <al0nem0nster> @Reizie_Etherealm yeah the human wave strategy of information never really helps
[2:15:43] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat You can earn more money than there are chests in a level. Just gotta move on
[2:15:46] <%boomstarprime> excess money goes into your level
[2:15:46] <NumberTooBig> stop gambling pat
[2:15:46] <%lewdskeletor13> BabyRage play the game the way I want you to Paaaaaat!
[2:15:49] <%boomstarprime> just go pat
[2:15:49] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[2:15:51] <%GoldeNOVA> I hope Pat gets to unlock other characters
[2:15:51] <+Dycroma> nice, fruits a good active
[2:15:52] <aimlesshealer> Y'all realize it's literally in his rules "please don't backseat" NotLikeThis
[2:15:52] <T_Sasquatch> re tear ass house
[2:15:55] <sukiyakiwestern> chance shrine
[2:15:57] <CptBritches> You can only get up to two items from chance shrines
[2:15:58] <+timbob> Wasn't a huge fan of the first game, how is this one?
[2:15:58] <%Spydurman> activate the teleporter
[2:16:04] <@SSaryn> @lewdskeletor13 Do it tho, play the game guuder like me
[2:16:10] <%ThePuddingDead> so the more stuff u find the more gets added to your model?
[2:16:10] <+BurkeBigsby> You got an item bound to Y. Should be a heal.
[2:16:10] <lejeune> PLAY GAME GUD
[2:16:11] <%Niney_Who> Time for 4 BOSSES
[2:16:12] <%skizzuto> @T_Sasquatch it made more sense in RoR1 where there were way more characters, and it was 2D
[2:16:13] <lejeune> pls
[2:16:15] <%Niney_Who> *2
[2:16:21] <@SSaryn> Yeah he might be fine
[2:16:23] <nobknee> @timbob Just as good, but 3D and still cookin' in the oven.
[2:16:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, beetles
[2:16:24] <CptBritches> challenge of the mountain is TWO bosses, have fun
[2:16:25] <Parapattern> M I S TA K E
[2:16:25] <starotter70> Oh boy
[2:16:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There's 2???
[2:16:33] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[2:16:33] <DavidSanChan> hot, two queens
[2:16:35] <aimlesshealer> Use the force, Luke!
[2:16:35] <$StarlitStunner> stripSad stripD stripSad
[2:16:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[2:16:38] <StaticSunrise> that's the challenge of the mountain
[2:16:39] <Maleicus> big boys
[2:16:40] <caol2017> its fiiine
[2:16:40] <%Zaxshimysham> what a sexy beetle
[2:16:41] <%spiritofmojave> This is getting out of hand, now there's two of them
[2:16:43] <+shadow704> but you get double the items pat
[2:16:43] <%GoldeNOVA> You brought this on yourself
[2:16:44] <CptBritches> Then you shouldn't have invite the challenge of the mountain
[2:16:44] <MormonFreeman> He'll have an easier time when he unlocks characters
[2:16:45] <@SSaryn> So that's what challenging the mountain did.
[2:16:47] <+BurkeBigsby> But you'll get 2 decent itema.
[2:16:48] <%rytyoung> double killer queen's!
[2:16:49] <%lewdskeletor13> You can do it, I believe
[2:16:49] <+ShakeNDake> Welcome to the Mountain Shrine!
[2:16:50] <%Laecerelius> two bosses but also two boss loot? if you double challenge of mountain you get four bosses to fight
[2:16:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Reizie_Etherealm Challegne of the mountain doubles the challenge of any boss encounter
[2:17:00] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:17:04] <sileo_patronus> Two bosses for two boss rewards
[2:17:04] <+cgmerryo> kill adds
[2:17:06] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah i dunno bout this
[2:17:06] <%Kduff89> oh god kill the ads
[2:17:07] <%ArcanumMBD> rip
[2:17:08] <%spiritofmojave> this game seems like a cluster fuck of adds
[2:17:08] <%rytyoung> I believe in God
[2:17:09] <foreverN2dust> closer
[2:17:09] <%Laecerelius> make sure to burn adds for health
[2:17:10] <Ion_Laser> F
[2:17:11] <nobknee> do combo
[2:17:11] <$StarlitStunner> stripO tomatoConcern stripGun
[2:17:11] <@SSaryn> Waow
[2:17:11] <natebud> If you activate a teleporter, enemies will flood in, but eventually stop spawning until you leave the level. @AngriestPat
[2:17:13] <+Sxy_T_Rex> did good
[2:17:13] <%Bearphonics> What if Pat was short for Patthew?
[2:17:14] <%Niney_Who> Pat you can take your time to deal with Adds
[2:17:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> In my first ever run, I activated THREE trials of thee mountain..... I got stomped by 4 beetle queens and a fuckload of adds
[2:17:14] <%Mekhet09> KILL THE ADDS YOU FOOL.
[2:17:14] <SunsetJack> Not bad
[2:17:14] <starotter70> Did he get them?
[2:17:14] <lloyddboy> F
[2:17:15] <Fujiwara_92> Good run
[2:17:15] <%GrayMatterMiner> rip
[2:17:16] <%Zaxshimysham> you should have avoided death
[2:17:17] <%boomstarprime> you need to manage the little ones pat
[2:17:17] <%lewdskeletor13> PogChamp
[2:17:18] <eyedol33> Don't ignore the adds
[2:17:18] <+ArtemisCroc> you might wanted to have killed those smaller enemies a little bit
[2:17:18] <lejeune> NO BCKSET
[2:17:19] <Cymen90> L O S S
[2:17:19] <alcett> gotta kill the adds my dude
[2:17:19] <+Sxy_T_Rex> 死
[2:17:19] <%XeroVI> kill the adds
[2:17:20] <+cement_addiction> bar the challenge of the mountain, that was a smarter run
[2:17:20] <%Spydurman> kinda get it now?
[2:17:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just hold the triggers
[2:17:21] <DocMadfox> Have you never played an MMO before, Pat? KIll the adds
[2:17:21] <%Laecerelius> Pat, you've played MMOs
[2:17:22] <%boomstarprime> they will kill you
[2:17:22] <+timbob> So what is this game, a rogue like or something like that?
[2:17:23] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat the teleporter doesn't un-charge so feel free to be a huge coward if you're running low on health
[2:17:23] <foreverN2dust> Would have had it without doing the challenge
[2:17:23] <%Laecerelius> kill adds
[2:17:24] <ButterscotchSoda> would have had it if you didnt hit the shrine
[2:17:24] <+RocketBarrel> O O F
[2:17:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat crowd control is necessary at times, not always the best choice to focus on the boss
[2:17:27] <+Estuko> do you lose items if you collect too many?
[2:17:27] <%rytyoung> that's alot of ads
[2:17:29] <lejeune> rogue like
[2:17:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Mekhet09) (warning)
[2:17:32] <%PaladinDupre> those floating orb guys just seem to be a nuisance, can you actually kill them all?
[2:17:34] <flubber3d> rough night
[2:17:34] <+Haarute> Get adds. Also positioning and hiding is important.
[2:17:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just HOLD the triggers
[2:17:35] <extradopeness> Need co-op
[2:17:36] <%Nope80808> You voleentarilly increased the difficulty with the challenge of the moutain you used
[2:17:36] <%Laecerelius> plus killing adds with the monster tooth necklace gets you healing
[2:17:37] <lejeune> dont die
[2:17:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Reizie_Etherealm If you challenge the mountian twice you get HAHAHAHAHA level bosses
[2:17:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Local astronaut man gets gang banged by bugs "never before seen orgy" witness has commented
[2:17:41] <alcett> kill ads
[2:17:42] <%GoldeNOVA> Risk of Rain becomes a fucking Musou later
[2:17:44] <Talhee> Challenge of the mountain doubles the bosses and doubles the items, I.E on using 2 of them you fight 4 bosses and get 4 items
[2:17:44] <sukiyakiwestern> gotta know when to back out to heal. you also had a full heal item
[2:17:44] <iamnolionheart> Give it a shot on Easy to get a feel for the flow of play
[2:17:46] <+ShakeNDake> okay so 1) you probably had that w/o montain shrine. 2) you gotta clear ads a bit better, casue those orbs will kick your ass
[2:17:47] <@SSaryn> Honestly, crowd control is vital but if you know you can focus down the boss, do it.
[2:17:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Rogue likes are unforgiving man
[2:17:49] <dsauce999> WOW PAT, play the game exactly as I expect you too, even if you don't know what I am expecting!!!!
[2:17:50] <%rytyoung> try coop for the funsies
[2:17:51] <sileo_patronus> Didn't die to that boss as quickly at least
[2:17:52] <%Sullensniper> Sullensniper subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:17:52] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[2:17:54] <$StarlitStunner> stripHype stripBlank stripHype
[2:17:54] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You can just hold the Shoot button btw
[2:17:54] <%GoldeNOVA> Commando is the most vanilla character
[2:17:58] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Don't get discouraged. Ya know how roguelites be. They kick your ass, you get some unlocks, you climb a bit higher sometimes.
[2:17:59] <%skizzuto> @Estuko no, but enemies get stronger the more time you waste running around looking for loot
[2:17:59] <natebud> You should be using you alts as soon as they recharge.
[2:18:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Adds do keep spawning, but they will also keep building up if you don't occasionally thin them out
[2:18:00] <lloyddboy> EZ MODE
[2:18:02] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat there is a guide on steam to unlock all the characters by messing with some files if you want to give em a try
[2:18:08] <foreverN2dust> so pretty
[2:18:11] <+Estuko> Let him get the feel for the game instead of yelling at him NotLikeThis
[2:18:12] <%Zaxshimysham> sending you my energy
[2:18:15] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat For real pick Drizzle, it's "easy"
[2:18:15] <DocMadfox> @dsauce999 Some of this is actual advice, dude
[2:18:17] <+cement_addiction> theres a timer that spawns a boss and enemies, they only stop spawning when the timer runs out, and you still gotta clean up everything that spawns
[2:18:18] <%BioApple> oh pat's going to love huntress
[2:18:19] <+Estuko> @skizzuto ooohh
[2:18:21] <%rytyoung> @mythicalbrit that'd be cool
[2:18:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat BOTH triggers
[2:18:26] <%lewdskeletor13> @estuko No but we gotta hell tho Kappa
[2:18:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> This game looks super difficult
[2:18:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Yell tho I mean
[2:18:41] <+Antoids> Risk of Rain 2 Needs To Respect Its Players & Add an Easy Mode
[2:18:42] <%Mythicalbrit> @rytyoung why I'm trying to let him know the other characters are WAY more fun
[2:18:43] <%spiritofmojave> let the man have a formative experience tho
[2:18:48] <NumberTooBig> @Reizie_Etherealm not really, its just pat
[2:18:49] <Cardboard96> Where's the rain?
[2:18:50] <$StarlitStunner> Shatter the knees yes tomatoGrease
[2:18:50] <StaticSunrise> the game already has an easy mode
[2:18:51] <wheke_> hey pat yous a bitch
[2:18:53] <+Estuko> "But noone answered."
[2:18:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Reizie_Etherealm Only at first. Once you unlock characters and items it gets easy
[2:18:59] <+serranobros> the game gets easier when you get the robot or the engi
[2:18:59] <%Aztec50> gotta kill things to get xp and gold
[2:19:00] <Rhinoprotoss> Gonna have a rouge like stream with no progression
[2:19:03] <natebud> Regular shrines are a bad investment. Only use them if there are no chests left.
[2:19:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @wheke_ sipsipRude
[2:19:05] <BoBoCatBurger> @antoids there actually is a easy mod
[2:19:05] <Saltmeisterr> nice aim
[2:19:07] <+SolverCODO> SSS
[2:19:07] <BoBoCatBurger> Mode
[2:19:07] <nobknee> @Antoids Fuck, you gonna get someone with that. LUL
[2:19:09] <@SSaryn> Shrine of Chance is when you basically wanna high roll or you got cash to spend
[2:19:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm guessing Pat doesn't bother to become huge before attempting the boss
[2:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> fall damage is buuuuuuuullshit
[2:19:22] <+Nexoosen> The game is kinda hard, but it looks a lot more difficult rn because its learning curve is steep
[2:19:23] <%NeonTurnip> does pat want suggestions? or he just wanna play and learn it
[2:19:25] <%Mythicalbrit> Mythicalbrit converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:19:26] <+Antoids> :^)
[2:19:38] <%rytyoung> @mythicalbrit engineer is op, huntress looks fun and the sword guy looks cool
[2:19:38] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Nope80808) (warning)
[2:19:41] <lejeune> lets just watch the pat
[2:19:44] <%BioApple> YOOOO RED ITEM
[2:19:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat the golem fires the laser when the circle fully shrinks. If you jump at that moment you can dodge the laser
[2:19:45] <%Niney_Who> That's a good one
[2:19:46] <ItsKitKat_> You take fall damage in this one?
[2:19:48] <%lewdskeletor13> I think he’s just trying to learn. If he needs advice he’ll probably ask for it
[2:19:48] <%PaladinDupre> Do those floating orb things ever fuck off?
[2:19:50] <@Mechz71> @AngriestPat How does the gunplay feel? I looks really freaking flaccid so far
[2:19:51] <+notorious_rng> oh no not wake
[2:19:53] <%NeonTurnip> TEMP BUFFS
[2:19:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Use your middle fingers for triggers and index for bumpers
[2:19:55] <@SSaryn> Eyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's alright. Not early game tho
[2:19:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> WOOO TEMP BUFFS
[2:20:01] <%rytyoung> @itskitkat_ yeah
[2:20:02] <IMCthulhu> its godly late game
[2:20:02] <%ArcanumMBD> That item is garbage. Electric buff halves your health when it runs out.
[2:20:04] <aimlesshealer> @Mechz71 yeah, everything seems really floaty and blah
[2:20:04] <%Mythicalbrit> @rytyoung enjoying the artificer myself she does so much damage
[2:20:05] <Rhinoprotoss> Each run is temporary...
[2:20:06] <Fujiwara_92> temp buffs LUL
[2:20:07] <CptBritches> Red items are the highest tier
[2:20:11] <natebud> The buffs are all automatic, so theyre really passive.
[2:20:11] <%BioApple> @ItsKitKat_ You take fall damage in both games but it really only matters early game
[2:20:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> That is the second strongest item in the game
[2:20:13] <sukiyakiwestern> worst item lmaooooo
[2:20:14] <@SSaryn> EYYYYYY
[2:20:15] <kayamek> @ItsKitKat_ Yeah but you can roll near the ground
[2:20:15] <Parapattern> Pat, this is temp buffs the game
[2:20:25] <%Kduff89> temp buffs and consumable items. Pats actual kryptonite
[2:20:26] <nobknee> White, then green, then red.
[2:20:28] <sileo_patronus> Dude it's a passive that you don't have to do anything for it's fine
[2:20:28] <%Mythicalbrit> no there are yellow items
[2:20:29] <CptBritches> Well, the highest without lunar
[2:20:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Fall damage is gross man
[2:20:36] <ThDark> This game looks good, I guess it's worth picking up, even if I didn't play the first?
[2:20:36] <ckillroy> !uptim
[2:20:38] <%BioApple> passive temp buffs are fine because you literally can't save them
[2:20:41] <+ArtemisCroc> there are a lot of temp procs in ror
[2:20:43] <%rytyoung> @mythicalbrit wish it was on PS4 or the switch so bad
[2:20:43] <SunsetJack> There is one red item you should avoid cause it is a run killer.
[2:20:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @doc_ock_rokc nah Wake is garbage. Electric buff leaves you at half hp when it runs out. You're screwed if you don't have leech or healing to counteract that
[2:20:46] <%Mythicalbrit> its white = common green = rare red = epic and yellow = legendary
[2:20:47] <+Estuko> killing poor lizard lads (
[2:20:51] <+Estuko> :(
[2:20:51] <ckillroy> !uptime
[2:20:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 20m.
[2:20:55] <nobknee> @SunsetJack What item's that?
[2:20:56] <%FrustratedAF> chat, what's the respawn like if he dies?
[2:20:58] <zedravan> F
[2:20:59] <%NeonTurnip> @ThDark its literally the first game but 3D not 2D
[2:21:01] <Fujiwara_92> why
[2:21:01] <%NeonTurnip> so yes
[2:21:03] <SunsetJack> @nobknee Vulture
[2:21:08] <dsauce999> SWORDTRICSWORGUNTRIC
[2:21:10] <+Estuko> @FrustratedAF restart from the looks of it
[2:21:12] <sileo_patronus> @FrustratedAF start over
[2:21:16] <@SSaryn> Fall damage is exceedingly lenient and kinda bullshit at the same time, your auxiliary is to help prevent fall damage
[2:21:17] <+JavaManJoJo> @ThDark Playing the first game is totally not needed. But I'd recommend it still because the first game is a fun time.
[2:21:20] <nobknee> @SunsetJack I'm unfamiliar, what's that one about?
[2:21:20] <%Aztec50> you just start at level one if you die
[2:21:22] <%lewdskeletor13> So this is single player right?
[2:21:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat multiplayer is good for this game, it makes it much more dense with loot plus the advantage of numbrs thing is good for bosses
[2:21:27] <%PaladinDupre> yeah the existence of those persistent floating orb enemies alone has me turned off of this
[2:21:29] <%rytyoung> @frustratedaf solo mode you start over, coop you come back if your bro beats the level
[2:21:31] <%Niney_Who> Coward Juice
[2:21:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> just money
[2:21:36] <%GoldeNOVA> @lewdskeletor13 Multiplayer is the intended gameplay
[2:21:41] <lloyddboy> REDBULL
[2:21:42] <%ArcanumMBD> Sprint faster to get to chests faster to loot faster go fast
[2:21:44] <%Laecerelius> Pat got his redbull!
[2:21:44] <CptBritches> Yeah, but when you stack those drinks you can go fucking insane sanic fast
[2:21:44] <+smevvster> Pat Mobility is king here
[2:21:46] <%GoldeNOVA> He's currently solo for some reason
[2:21:50] <natebud> I think the rapid fire shoots through enemies @AngriestPat
[2:21:53] <%Aztec50> pat you gotta kill things
[2:21:55] <%lewdskeletor13> @goldenova Ah ok thanks. Don’t know much about this game
[2:22:02] <aimlesshealer> I hope he tries multiplayer in a bit, too
[2:22:03] <bonzosan> This game looks like it would be a bit easier with co op?
[2:22:04] <%Kduff89> I still think pats take on faust is hilarious. NumbR GO dOWn iS baD!
[2:22:06] <nobknee> I will sleep with your next death, Pat. KEEP ME AWAKE.
[2:22:08] <%Niney_Who> That's nice
[2:22:12] <SunsetJack> @nobknee It steals elite's buff but currently, one of the elite's buff is that it replaces half your HP with shield but when that buff is over, your only have half your HP left.
[2:22:15] <+Nexoosen> movement items let you clear the map of items faster, and are prolly the most important items in the early game @AngriestPat
[2:22:17] <+Kavtech> I got 20 of those sprint-cans in one run and it was amazing, and impractical.
[2:22:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bleeding is awesome
[2:22:19] <%ThePuddingDead> tanki boi
[2:22:20] <%lewdskeletor13> The number going down is always sad guys
[2:22:26] <%rytyoung> @kduff89 but the number go down tho
[2:22:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> A teddy bear! Aww
[2:22:30] <@SSaryn> You can still do solo but obviously you kinda need to know your character if you're gon a be going above Hard in this game
[2:22:31] <%FrustratedAF> 🤔 have there been any other 3D roguelites/roguelikes?
[2:22:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SunsetJack it doubles your health
[2:22:34] <%spiritofmojave> @Kavtech I bet that felt like playing Tribes or something LUL
[2:22:45] <mlmach6> :squeak:
[2:22:46] <lejeune> mothership is 3d roguelike
[2:22:47] <nobknee> @SunsetJack Ah, bugged, yeah? The risk of early access rains.
[2:22:48] <%GoldeNOVA> You need a new character is what you need
[2:22:50] <SunsetJack> @doc_ock_rokc Talking about vulture item, not moon.
[2:22:52] <lejeune> tower of guns
[2:22:56] <BoBoCatBurger> @frustratedaf plenty if you count FPS ones
[2:22:59] <%Aztec50> i think there are a few 3d roguelikes
[2:23:01] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat I'm amazed at your tolerance of the floating orb guys, i cant stand them just watching this
[2:23:01] <%voidthieff> has he unlocked any characters yet?
[2:23:05] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[2:23:05] <+gogozeppli> how many runs is he?
[2:23:06] <%Mekhet09> no
[2:23:06] <@SSaryn> Theres always a learning process to these kinds of games and it just takes time
[2:23:09] <%Tucker0603> nope
[2:23:09] <%lewdskeletor13> This is some chill music
[2:23:09] <%Niney_Who> You passed like two
[2:23:11] <caol2017> blind
[2:23:12] <aimlesshealer> this reminds me of that one planet from ME1... with the little monkeys
[2:23:14] <lloyddboy> 3rd run
[2:23:14] <%ArcanumMBD> @voidthieff nope
[2:23:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @voidthieff nope hasn't beat level 1
[2:23:15] <%rytyoung> @frustratedaf tower of guns, paranautical activity are both FPS roguelikes
[2:23:18] <Saltmeisterr> wait the levels aren't random?
[2:23:22] <+Grayhammatter> you past one on the lower level
[2:23:25] <foreverN2dust> walked passed two under the arches
[2:23:25] <Fujiwara_92> actual blindness

[2:23:28] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[2:23:30] <natebud> its tough
[2:23:31] <+SimplyPandaz> very tough
[2:23:31] <resstarr> yes
[2:23:32] <SunsetJack> Yes
[2:23:33] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:23:33] <@SSaryn> @grayhammatter Not completely.
[2:23:33] <%BioApple> Levels are semi-random but have consistent overall structure
[2:23:34] <TheHeroAppears> no at this level
[2:23:34] <%boomstarprime> huh
[2:23:34] <Parapattern> Yes, VERY
[2:23:34] <CptBritches> It gets WAY tougher
[2:23:35] <NumberTooBig> meh
[2:23:35] <+Kilik_> yea it's hard
[2:23:35] <%NeonTurnip> at first it is tough yes
[2:23:36] <%spiritofmojave> looks that way
[2:23:36] <+JavaManJoJo> it's fairly tough, yeah
[2:23:36] <%GoldeNOVA> Not yet
[2:23:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah it's tough until you learn it
[2:23:36] <FirewallStorm> yes
[2:23:37] <%Spydurman> yes
[2:23:37] <Ner234> It is
[2:23:37] <SulfurousAcid> no chest only boss
[2:23:37] <%skizzuto> YOOOOOOO
[2:23:37] <+theKingRamses> it's reasonably difficult until it isn't
[2:23:38] <natebud> That's really good
[2:23:38] <@SSaryn> WAOW
[2:23:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Saltmeisterr simi random. There are going to be more stanges later
[2:23:38] <%Niney_Who> Summon Swords PogChamp
[2:23:39] <SunsetJack> Nice item
[2:23:39] <InvaderKAZ> It's moderately tough
[2:23:39] <alcett> super good item
[2:23:39] <+Estuko> WHITE ALBUM
[2:23:39] <sileo_patronus> @Saltmeisterr nah, there's variants at least
[2:23:41] <ItsKitKat_> YOOO
[2:23:41] <+gogozeppli> you need to get one item and kill the boss
[2:23:42] <nobknee> Yeah, it's tough. It's a roguelite, they meant to fuck you good.
[2:23:43] <mlmach6> yeah quite
[2:23:44] <+cement_addiction> DAMN
[2:23:44] <%Aztec50> chest drops are random but the layout is the same
[2:23:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its tough at first
[2:23:45] <+smevvster> Yoooo that item's great
[2:23:46] <%boomstarprime> well i got 55 minutes in on my first try
[2:23:48] <lejeune> summon swords
[2:23:49] <SunsetJack> Oh fuck, he has vulture, shit.
[2:23:50] <+Nexoosen> @Saltmeisterr the levels are not, theres usually little things that changve in em, but not much, the item/portal and spawn points are randomised though
[2:23:50] <%ArcanumMBD> apatBig apatBig LUCK RUN
[2:23:52] <Fujiwara_92> WHITE ALBUM PogChamp
[2:23:53] <resstarr> Look for red particles to find the teleporter
[2:23:54] <+gogozeppli> you take too long it gets too hard
[2:24:03] <SunsetJack> This might be bad.
[2:24:05] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s probably tough because you doubt know it well enough yet I’d assume
[2:24:06] <T_Sasquatch> ooooo
[2:24:06] <%BioApple> god this is the absolute best item in ror1
[2:24:08] <+ArtemisCroc> Does anyone know is acrid is still in this game?
[2:24:09] <%NeonTurnip> that item was so good in the first game but now its poo pooPepeHands
[2:24:12] <+Estuko> Pogchamp Gently Weeps
[2:24:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> The ice is a murder machine
[2:24:16] <%NeonTurnip> PepeHands
[2:24:16] <+Kilik_> @boomstarprime the stage you get to matters a lot too, you can either rush or take your time and build up strength
[2:24:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Don’t know it I mean
[2:24:21] <%NeonTurnip> oh yea we dont have that
[2:24:24] <+Kilik_> I had a 3 hour run earlier
[2:24:25] <%boomstarprime> roll to prevent fall damage
[2:24:25] <%skizzuto> @ArtemisCroc not currently, though it's still in early access
[2:24:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if Pat would be interested in Sunless Sea or Sunless Skies
[2:24:25] <%AncelDeLambert> how is he so good at focusing the high hp enemies first?
[2:24:27] <%rytyoung> ceremonial dagger is my bae
[2:24:33] <+gogozeppli> no acrid
[2:24:35] <%Niney_Who> gorb
[2:24:35] <CptBritches> Try the shrine of chance if you have the money and aren't going to use it
[2:24:35] <%AncelDeLambert> it's like he enjoys being surrounded by adds
[2:24:38] <+gogozeppli> bandit is next
[2:24:41] <+Arathiun> Timing a roll before you fall negates alot of fall damage
[2:24:43] <@SSaryn> Frost Relic is still pretty damn good in this game but it's a lot better for the Mercenary now due to obvious reasons
[2:24:49] <+Nexoosen> tesla best red fight me
[2:24:51] <+ArtemisCroc> @skizzuto Dang, I hope hee makes it is, he was my go-to
[2:24:56] <sukiyakiwestern> pat theres a boss you might get that has a huge aoe that you have to het out of line of sight
[2:24:57] <+Kilik_> tesla and behemoth
[2:25:01] <Kalcom> jesus kill the mobs
[2:25:02] <rosemon5001> @ArtemisCroc not yet but there are a few character still locked in this release that are in the coming soon stage soo lets hope
[2:25:03] <+theKingRamses> ROUND 2
[2:25:03] <arcaderabbit48> This game seems kind of insane even at this low a level
[2:25:06] <nobknee> Risk of Rain 2 needs my boy Acrid in there.
[2:25:10] <+gogozeppli> acrid might be bad since it's 3d now
[2:25:13] <%Mythicalbrit> Nexo I had a friend who got tesla + uke they proc each other
[2:25:14] <%Cthulos> this is risk of rain 2 I assume?
[2:25:17] <sukiyakiwestern> MINER WHEN
[2:25:17] <%NeonTurnip> @SSaryn yea true but its not grand on many others than him, maybe the engi for it to be on his tureets
[2:25:17] <reonome> don't die pat
[2:25:19] <+Andrizzleton> icicles stronk
[2:25:19] <+Grayhammatter> he do it

[2:25:21] <Ion_Laser> @Cthulos yeah
[2:25:22] <%GoldeNOVA> Where's the Lava Worm tho?
[2:25:23] <%rytyoung> I love acrid so much in ror1
[2:25:25] <%Laecerelius> kill adds!
[2:25:28] <%ArcanumMBD> FLEE LIKE A HERO
[2:25:31] <TwinBat> oh god oh fuck

[2:25:32] <aimlesshealer> so many dudes WutFace
[2:25:32] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Run! Run away!
[2:25:33] <+Kilik_> @arcaderabbit48 just wait until later on lol
[2:25:34] <%voidthieff> apatBig retreat
[2:25:35] <$StarlitStunner> tomatoPain tomatoBWL
[2:25:36] <ItsKitKat_> kill adds for goodness sake
[2:25:36] <%Tearonex> it's AOE is better
[2:25:36] <nobknee> @gogozeppli Merc's in, they better add Acrid. I wanna SPIT SPAT.
[2:25:38] <reonome> JUMP
[2:25:40] <%ArcanumMBD> Brave brave Sir Patrick, bravely ran away!
[2:25:41] <%lewdskeletor13> What’s with the squeaky noises LUL
[2:25:42] <InvaderKAZ> Pat you should not get hit
[2:25:44] <+ArtemisCroc> Acrid would be great in 3D, he would just need melee area sweeps
[2:25:44] <%spiritofmojave> Welcome to Add City
[2:25:49] <%rytyoung> apatBig coward it
[2:25:49] <reonome> RUN PAT
[2:25:49] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat you know, believe it or not enemies that are not the boss attack you
[2:25:52] <%ArcanumMBD> @lewdskeletor13 the squeek is the teddybear blocking a hit
[2:25:52] <%skizzuto> you'd have to change acrid's movement skill, and make his 2nd ability more like that acid spit the beetle queen does, but he could work in 3D
[2:25:53] <%Hammerknife> i just remembered that pat is playing this with controller and not m/kb
[2:25:55] <@SSaryn> @lewdskeletor13 Tougher times
[2:25:56] <goddamndavid> are you playing on normal difficulty for your first time???
[2:25:57] <BoBoCatBurger> Pat crowd control is SUPER important
[2:25:58] <IMCthulhu> gotta love when it spawns 50% wisps, 50% every other creature
[2:25:59] <%Laecerelius> pick up gorbs
[2:26:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What is this? Starship troopers?
[2:26:03] <%PaladinDupre> this just looks annoying to play
[2:26:03] <+Haarute> @AngriestPat Always focus enemies that are closer to you.
[2:26:05] <arcaderabbit48> @Kilik_ Assuming we get that far. I feel sorry for Pat, I think he bit off more than he can chew with this game

[2:26:14] <%schlager087> Welcome to easy
[2:26:15] <%boomstarprime> pat you are really bad at this im sorry
[2:26:15] <natebud> You should be killing the small enemies first. They'll eventually stop spawning.
[2:26:17] <%Niney_Who> Getting close to enemies is suicide
[2:26:19] <T_Sasquatch> wow
[2:26:20] <foreverN2dust> closer
[2:26:20] <%GoldeNOVA> This is NOTHING YET

[2:26:36] <%Keyd00d> I come in to sadness
[2:26:37] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat there is a guide on steam to unlock all the characters by messing with some files if you want to give em a try
[2:26:37] <+ShakeNDake> getting there!
[2:26:37] <rosemon5001> ye you need to stand in the teleporter circle to stop the spawning
[2:26:38] <+BaronEgo> Pat have you played the first Risk of Rain?
[2:26:39] <nobknee> Alright, bedtime! Good luck, don't get discouraged @AngriestPat
[2:26:40] <%rytyoung> jumping helps dodging projectiles when you can't dodgeroll
[2:26:41] <Saltmeisterr> shit looks like bs
[2:26:42] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Play on Drizzle, TRUST ME
[2:26:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat you may have better results with a hybrid control scheme
[2:26:43] <%NeonTurnip> @AngriestPat deff wanna keep the wisps as high prio adds cause they can fuck you up
[2:26:44] <ItsKitKat_> @AngriestPat as soon as boss spawns, run away, and focus adds
[2:26:44] <lejeune> use the PIERCE
[2:26:46] <+Sxy_T_Rex> 死
[2:26:46] <%voidthieff> this soundtrack really slaps eh?
[2:26:47] <alcett> you gotta be a bit more mobile
[2:26:48] <+serranobros> woolieSMUG
[2:26:48] <goddamndavid> you gotta play with some friends, pat!
[2:26:50] <zedravan> @MrGarettLefebvre You normally play it in multiplayer
[2:26:50] <+Estuko> @MrGarettLefebvre some people are a big fan of these sorta games, increasingly challenging gauntlet/enemy waves style games
[2:26:51] <lejeune> power of GUN
[2:26:52] <FalseProphet115> you stuck at video games
[2:26:53] <nobknee> @gogozeppli Acrid has SPIT SPAT. Instant win forever.
[2:26:54] <foreverN2dust> @BaronEgo played one round then dropped
[2:26:55] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat So in addition to the clear jump from Easy to Medium, there's 3 bars in each difficulty, and enemies scale up a little bit as you progress through those
[2:26:58] <Yeajow> Maybe do coop to ease into this kinda game :)
[2:27:02] <+smevvster> No that's not how it works
[2:27:03] <+Kilik_> once it hits 99% mobs stop spawning
[2:27:03] <%Spydurman> git gud
[2:27:05] <%BioApple> spawning only stops when it's fully charged and the boss is dead
[2:27:05] <reonome> well no
[2:27:05] <ItsKitKat_> no, thats a kie
[2:27:06] <%Niney_Who> Thatr's wrong
[2:27:08] <+Haarute> Keep your distance always.
[2:27:08] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat this looks annoying to play, is it?
[2:27:09] <lloyddboy> LIES
[2:27:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Just tap your feet Pat it’ll help @angriestpat Kappa
[2:27:11] <nobknee> Goodnight, folks, enjoy the speedrun. Kappa
[2:27:11] <reonome> THATS WRONG
[2:27:12] <%Aztec50> Like all rogue likes, you have to learn and get good drops in order to move forward
[2:27:12] <%Piemen99> lie!
[2:27:14] <Fujiwara_92> titãs wrong
[2:27:14] <sukiyakiwestern> nah multi and singleplayer are balanced
[2:27:15] <Saltmeisterr> LIE
[2:27:15] <%Niney_Who> Standing in the circle just charges up the Teleporter
[2:27:15] <+Nexoosen> @AngriestPat It only stops spawning once the boss and timer are over, that advice wouldnt have helped you there
[2:27:16] <%XeroVI> switch to drizzle unlock you unlock a few more items or a different character
[2:27:17] <aimlesshealer> @lewdskeletor13 LUL
[2:27:18] <SunsetJack> Does it stop spawning at 99? I don't think so...
[2:27:18] <+theKingRamses> that teleporter/spawning thing is a huge lie
[2:27:18] <+NiktenKing> 3
[2:27:20] <foreverN2dust> LIE
[2:27:21] <@SSaryn> Drizzle is honestly not gonna help you. All it does is make the difficulty forecast go slower. and yeah you should stick to the teleporter circle as long as you possibly can, does not stop spawning though
[2:27:21] <%Spydurman> 3
[2:27:25] <natebud> Teleporter circle to stop spawning wasn't in the first game. BIG LIE
[2:27:26] <xeroslash1> if its anything like the first game, jumping will make most things miss you
[2:27:27] <SulfurousAcid> 3
[2:27:29] <+Arathiun> mobs only stop when teleporter is 99%, but u need to be inside the zone to progress it
[2:27:33] <%Piemen99> 3
[2:27:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh shit... Pats playing on medium....
[2:27:36] <reonome> it only stops spawning when you beat the boss and finish the charge
[2:27:38] <+Dycroma> balancing attacking the boss and mobbing is difficult
[2:27:39] <+TheNeonGraveyard> My fave in RoR1 was the sniper. Is the game out or just a demo/beta?
[2:27:44] <%spiritofmojave> BPM is everything Pat sugoiSmugsnake
[2:27:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> no wondeer he is having trouble
[2:27:46] <%Aztec50> if the percent gets to 100 then things do stop spawning
[2:27:49] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The items you find seem to be utility more than baseline dmg or def boost
[2:27:51] <CptBritches> Almost like it's random
[2:27:53] <Ir_ramble> Pat, when does Elmo get his milkies?
[2:27:54] <dipstere> Correction, you need to stand inside the circle to hit 99% and killing the boss will get you to 100%
[2:27:55] <%BioApple> @TheNeonGraveyard early access, sniper's not in but could be later
[2:27:56] <%ArcanumMBD> I THINK spawning gets slowed down the higher your teleport charge gets, but that could just be placebo
[2:28:00] <%rytyoung> @theneongraveyard early acces pc only
[2:28:04] <Lunatyr_> when it hits 99% mobs stop spawning
[2:28:05] <+JavaManJoJo> there's a little cliff edge here tho
[2:28:09] <%PaladinDupre> KILL THEM ALL
[2:28:16] <InvaderKAZ> Hey Pat your guns have infinite ranges you can run away and shoot you don't gotta get so close
[2:28:18] <natebud> Look at your choices up here
[2:28:23] <+FilthyHereticHorus> So whats this games gimmick?
[2:28:25] <+gogozeppli> just get one big chest and gun for the boss
[2:28:25] <+Zombiemowlcher> Pat can I play with you?
[2:28:36] <+ShakeNDake> also, yeah. there is an easy mode so you can get a better feel on the game. if youre still having trouble getting past the first lvl.
[2:28:38] <+Kilik_> they definitely stop spawning at 99%
[2:28:40] <%deviljhojho94> When is it going to rain?
[2:28:40] <StaticSunrise> turn the difficulty down for an easier time learning mechanics
[2:28:41] <%voidthieff> syringe is mad good
[2:28:42] <+JavaManJoJo> you need money
[2:28:42] <%Spydurman> yes
[2:28:43] <%ArcanumMBD> They do, that's bad advice
[2:28:43] <+ShakeNDake> yes, they are infinite
[2:28:46] <@SSaryn> Yes they do.
[2:28:46] <%rytyoung> @filthyheretichorus get upgrades and become disgustingly op
[2:28:47] <sileo_patronus> They spawn infinitely yes
[2:28:48] <Fujiwara_92> yes
[2:28:50] <+Nexoosen> @InvaderKAZ There is ranged damage falloff, so being a lil closer isnt a bad thing
[2:28:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Syringe DansGame
[2:28:52] <%skizzuto> they stop spawning after you've killed the boss and finished the teleporter event
[2:28:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes but they give you money
[2:28:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat you are playing at the mdium difficulty bt
[2:28:55] <InvaderKAZ> @FilthyHereticHorus It's a Rogelike, you collect random items to try to get stronger and if you die you just start over
[2:28:56] <%Keyd00d> 3
[2:28:57] <Onamar> Keep the flying guys under control they hit deceptively hard
[2:28:57] <+ShakeNDake> also, syringe HYPE!
[2:28:57] <natebud> You can kill all enemies after the teleporter is activated, otherwise it's infinite @AngriestPat
[2:29:00] <$StarlitStunner> stripO stripYDesu
[2:29:00] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> you should kill when you dont have money, and search when you do
[2:29:00] <+Zombiemowlcher> Easy mode is also great for unlocking shit
[2:29:01] <%BioApple> @FilthyHereticHorus mostly the difficulty scaling with run time. otherwise it's all about passive effect stacking
[2:29:03] <InvaderKAZ> Oh I didn't know about the damage falloff neat
[2:29:05] <+ArtemisCroc> you should always kill the enemies that can shoot you at least
[2:29:06] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat if they spawn infiniely isnt that just annoying?
[2:29:07] <CptBritches> I think they just meant kill all enemies until you have enough money
[2:29:09] <$cureneckbeard> kill the enemies fast
[2:29:16] <Fujiwara_92> chat giving dubious tips LUL
[2:29:20] <CptBritches> That's a healing drone
[2:29:23] <@SSaryn> Managing where to go and what to get is always gonna be a puzzle in this game
[2:29:25] <%Niney_Who> That's a healing drone
[2:29:26] <+Haarute> You should play easy mode to get the hang of the game and get more unlocks. Then move to medium.
[2:29:26] <%voidthieff> @lewdskeletor13 is mad good mang
[2:29:27] <%lewdskeletor13> We always give dubious tips
[2:29:31] <tetriata> One of the problems with RoR is that Commando, the character you start with in both games, is considered by a lot of people to be easily the most dull and uninteresting character to play
[2:29:32] <+gogozeppli> click in the right stick to ping
[2:29:36] <%Niney_Who> Pat doesn't even notice it's 3 choices
[2:29:38] <+gogozeppli> so you can ping big chests
[2:29:41] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat those tripod chests let you pick one of the 3 items
[2:29:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Who would give advice without knowing what advice to give?
[2:30:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Kappa
[2:30:00] <%BioApple> @tetriata I think actually having to aim in this one makes him more fun, but yeah the other characters are just more weird and interesting
[2:30:01] <aimlesshealer> This music is making me sleepy...
[2:30:03] <+Estuko> @Reizie_Etherealm a lot of people.
[2:30:05] <%rytyoung> The fact it's 3D now compared to 2D makes exploring and remember level layouts and chest spawns way hardwe
[2:30:08] <NumberTooBig> @Reizie_Etherealm twitch Kappa
[2:30:09] <%rytyoung> harder
[2:30:12] <SunsetJack> No point on using ping in single player.
[2:30:13] <%Ninestempest> A lot of dumbasses
[2:30:14] <+trashamn> GET THE DRONE
[2:30:15] <Onamar> Drones are good
[2:30:15] <%ArcanumMBD> Drones are good
[2:30:16] <+ArtemisCroc> yes you do want a drone
[2:30:16] <natebud> You might want that.
[2:30:17] <+Haarute> Drones are actually good.
[2:30:17] <%Niney_Who> Those ARE items
[2:30:18] <lloyddboy> GET IT
[2:30:18] <SunsetJack> It doesn't even last long.
[2:30:18] <%skizzuto> drones are good tho
[2:30:20] <foreverN2dust> THE DRONE IS GOOD
[2:30:20] <+trashamn> DRONE GOOD
[2:30:20] <ItsKitKat_> GET THE DRONE
[2:30:21] <+ArtemisCroc> drones follow you around
[2:30:22] <CptBritches> Drones are good they distract enemies
[2:30:23] <%Niney_Who> Drones are Good you trashman
[2:30:23] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Drones are FREE damage
[2:30:24] <Fujiwara_92> DRONE THO
[2:30:26] <@SSaryn> While Commando may be dull and boring to most, he was still considered one of the best characters in ROR1, and still in ROR2.
[2:30:27] <InugamiTheHound> WTF is this game and is this a sequel to the original game?
[2:30:27] <ButterscotchSoda> Drones good not turrets tho
[2:30:29] <sileo_patronus> Drones follow you through levels
[2:30:32] <%Mekhet09> PAT why.
[2:30:33] <+Arathiun> drones are good, they follow you between levels
[2:30:33] <reonome> drones persist through levels @AngriestPat
[2:30:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh no now he likes items too much
[2:30:35] <+gogozeppli> 1 healing drone and you can down the boss
[2:30:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's a perfectly good and reasonable explanation lol
[2:30:40] <lloyddboy> OPTIONS
[2:30:43] <@SSaryn> Ehh crowbar is fine
[2:30:45] <%ArcanumMBD> Healthy = 90% hp or higher
[2:30:47] <%Ninestempest> Crowbar is meh
[2:30:47] <+NiktenKing> Drones yes, turrets... no
[2:30:47] <+Nexoosen> Drones are real good earlygame but fall off late
[2:30:47] <natebud> first hits do more damage. sokay
[2:30:48] <%rytyoung> @inugamithehound it wouldn't have a 2 if it wasn't a sequel
[2:30:50] <ItsKitKat_> PAT please it hurts
[2:30:53] <+gogozeppli> look for a healing drone instead
[2:30:54] <%boomstarprime> you almost never want turrets
[2:30:59] <BoBoCatBurger> Get drones fuck turrets
[2:30:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound Risk of Rain2 and its a sequiel to risk of rain
[2:31:08] <+theKingRamses> drone = good, turret = not so great
[2:31:09] <%ArcanumMBD> rip
[2:31:10] <%Ninestempest> LOL
[2:31:10] <%ThePuddingDead> yep
[2:31:10] <+ArtemisCroc> HOW
[2:31:11] <%Keyd00d> welp
[2:31:13] <+Nexoosen> Having one crowbar is great, but more than one the diminishing returns are too poor
[2:31:13] <InugamiTheHound> so what is this game about?
[2:31:14] <CptBritches> Gotta pay attention lmao

[2:31:21] <%Hammerknife> >try lowering the difficulty
[2:31:24] <natebud> both are okay, they heal over time.
[2:31:24] <Ir_ramble> you art dead
[2:31:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat try the easier difficulty
[2:31:25] <%XeroVI> switch to drizzle for a little while
[2:31:25] <%Typhaeon> What was that about lowering the difficulty? LuL
[2:31:28] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat just play on easy until you know how the game works! no shame in that at all
[2:31:29] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat You can unlock all the characters by messing with some game files theres a guide for it on steam
[2:31:30] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat believe it or not things shoot at you when your not looking
[2:31:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Does it ever rain in this game?
[2:31:32] <%ArcanumMBD> Lemurian fireballs are legit. Gotta strafe that shit
[2:31:32] <%Niney_Who> Drizzle wouldn't make this easier for him
[2:31:32] <CptBritches> You just let yourself die there
[2:31:32] <%spiritofmojave> does this game have a easy modo
[2:31:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Easy mode is now selectable
[2:31:33] <+JavaManJoJo> jumping more can help
[2:31:34] <foreverN2dust> This version has the god of war problem of shit behind you.
[2:31:35] <MrGarettLefebvre> Pat do you who is managing the SBFP Vimeo channel?
[2:31:35] <+ShakeNDake> guys, that elite slows you down a lot
[2:31:37] <ButterscotchSoda> @AngriestPat play on drizzle till you get the hang of it
[2:31:40] <%voidthieff> @Hammerknife see you get it
[2:31:41] <%BioApple> because it's easier???
[2:31:41] <+gogozeppli> healing drone takes aggro
[2:31:42] <%nmaten> maybe try to keep enemies from getting behind you youve been taking a ton of damage that way
[2:31:44] <CptBritches> Because you are bad
[2:31:45] <SunsetJack> It helps manage time and practice.
[2:31:47] <DocMadfox> Because you're having problems
[2:31:48] <%skizzuto> so you can unlock better items/characters
[2:31:49] <+Haarute> @AngriestPat ALWAYS keep your distance. If enemies are surrounding you, you're doing it bad.
[2:31:49] <@SSaryn> @hammerknife Wont matter, will only lower the difficulty forecast timer
[2:31:50] <%ArcanumMBD> Drizzle is too easy right now imo
[2:31:50] <natebud> if the drone breaks you pay to repair it, they do heal over time though @AngriestPat
[2:31:51] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat and people said sekiro was hard LUL
[2:31:52] <reonome> because you are bad
[2:31:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound You crash landed on an alien planet and are using random teleporters until you get back to your ship so you an leave
[2:31:53] <Monkeyweed21> cuz you bad
[2:31:53] <+ArtemisCroc> that deathh was because pat was standing still while getting shot
[2:31:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Why not? It would help you learn the game more if you can progress more right?
[2:31:58] <+ArtemisCroc> not because of the difficulty
[2:32:00] <+Nexoosen> @AngriestPat so you can get more fun characters because commando suuuucks
[2:32:01] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat cause the game is hard lol, takes a while to get used to. I'm 15 hours in and I can't do more than 1 full run 100% of the time on normal
[2:32:01] <StaticSunrise> to LEARN THE GAME
[2:32:01] <%Niney_Who> That's an Active Item chest
[2:32:01] <DocMadfox> Because you're making no progress
[2:32:03] <+YabbaTroll> so we have content @AngriestPat
[2:32:04] <startstoprepeat> to learn what the fuck that is
[2:32:04] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You have no one unlocked, you don't know what items do you can't even kill ONE boss
[2:32:05] <iamnolionheart> I mean as long as you're having fun right?
[2:32:06] <@SSaryn> Equipment boxes
[2:32:07] <foreverN2dust> To acclimate to the game quicker. You become better quicker
[2:32:08] <+theKingRamses> orange tiny box gives you a Y button ability
[2:32:09] <%Niney_Who> That's a chest that gives you one of those Y button items
[2:32:09] <%NeonTurnip> guys hes learning stop telling him to play it on easy
[2:32:09] <ButterscotchSoda> @AngriestPat it gets just as hard it just takes longer to
[2:32:10] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Orange box is useable item guaranteed
[2:32:15] <+NiktenKing> Orange are active items
[2:32:16] <sukiyakiwestern> pat needs huntress aiming on controller is suffering
[2:32:18] <OkamiDude15> Pat if food is a consumable why would you ever eat them? woopsHmm
[2:32:18] <+Arathiun> i'd only do easier mode if you really dont like commando, so you can unlock others
[2:32:19] <%Niney_Who> HUD IS GOOD
[2:32:20] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat it's like FTL. Easy is the mode you learn the game on.
[2:32:22] <reonome> all it does is slow down the difficulty timer anyway, doesn't change anything else @AngriestPat
[2:32:24] <@SSaryn> EYYYYYYY
[2:32:25] <%BioApple> man this item fucking SLAPS with mul-t
[2:32:28] <Fujiwara_92> geez chat, are we gonna have to have the sekiro talk again? Keepo
[2:32:31] <@SSaryn> That's an ocular HUD mah bois
[2:32:32] <%rytyoung> You do you Pat, your life is your own
[2:32:33] <%Niney_Who> That's Double Damage for 8 seconds
[2:32:34] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat you can ping locatioans chests and the spawners dont know what button its on the controller though
[2:32:36] <%spiritofmojave> that seems tight
[2:32:37] <XeloGel> crits are double damage
[2:32:37] <+ShakeNDake> so you can better get a feel for what the game is asking you to do. sure, you figure it out this way through persistence, but ...
[2:32:40] <Nitesco> Chat is real annoying tonight LUL
[2:32:43] <CptBritches> They removed the bug that let you have infinite damage with MUL-T
[2:32:45] <%voidthieff> would yall say this is harder or easier than the first game?

[2:32:54] <%ArcanumMBD> People played FTL on easy? What's the point?
[2:32:54] <%Mekhet09> Did you ever beat FTL?
[2:32:57] <+NiktenKing> harder
[2:33:01] <%PaladinDupre> Does this game have a Shotgun?
[2:33:02] <ButterscotchSoda> harder
[2:33:02] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't even beat FTL on easy...
[2:33:04] <natebud> pat youre doing the right thing
[2:33:05] <$cureneckbeard> pat play the ftl
[2:33:05] <%Ninestempest> @PaladinDupre not atm
[2:33:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Speaking of FTL, has Pat ever streamed it? I might wanna see it
[2:33:08] <Fujiwara_92> harder
[2:33:10] <DocMadfox> There ya go

[2:33:10] <InugamiTheHound> learn by doing!!-Ryan Haywood from achievement hunter
[2:33:11] <%Ninestempest> THIS EXPLAINS A LOT PAT
[2:33:12] <%Winnosh> Winnosh subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat think you'll go back to Vampire?
[2:33:13] <reonome> LUL
[2:33:14] <Sitromxe> What?
[2:33:14] <%Typhaeon> I only beat FTL once
[2:33:15] <$cureneckbeard> why won't pat play the games i like
[2:33:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PaladinDupre There is a class that might soon
[2:33:15] <%skizzuto> I wonder why
[2:33:16] <%deviljhojho94> I only watch ginger streamers tomatoCool
[2:33:16] <%lewdskeletor13> He’ll figure it out guys, I don’t think the difficulty will make that much a difference
[2:33:17] <foreverN2dust> crowbar
[2:33:17] <lizard0tm> Gee, I wonder why
[2:33:19] <lloyddboy> LUL
[2:33:19] <startstoprepeat> could there possibly be a lesson there
[2:33:19] <Sitromxe> Seriously?
[2:33:19] <@SSaryn> Honestly if people didnt beat FTL, you were fine not to. FTL was fucked
[2:33:20] <%BioApple> @CptBritches the one that makes the lens effect last as long as you're holding M1? Damn, I just found that this afternoon
[2:33:20] <+ArtemisCroc> easy mode is generally a bad way to learn a game since you get comfortable with the easier difficulty anyway
[2:33:20] <Monkeyweed21> exactly
[2:33:29] <%ThePuddingDead> my fiance' made chili dogs for dinner :3
[2:33:31] <%Mekhet09> Not in FTL.
[2:33:32] <%spiritofmojave> I understand that, FTL's ending is a bitch to get through
[2:33:33] <%NeonTurnip> i never played on easy yet and i have 30+ hours in the game he doesnt need to play on easy guys
[2:33:35] <DocMadfox> FTL was generally good, but winning it requires some luck
[2:33:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PaladinDupre Multi has a kinda shotgun but its better used as a machinegun
[2:33:35] <Sitromxe> FTL was so easy though?
[2:33:36] <%Ninestempest> FTL is really easy without mods lmao
[2:33:38] <%ArcanumMBD> @PaladinDupre sort of but not really. The robot's initital shot is a shotgun, so you can keep tapping fire to shotgun, but it's a DPS loss over holding the button down for full auto
[2:33:40] <zamzoph> wel the FTL boss is kinda bullshit that you have to specifically gear for despite the rest of the run
[2:33:44] <StaticSunrise> commando does more damage at closer range
[2:33:46] <+Estuko> @ThePuddingDead do you happen to be a blue hedgehog btw doodStare
[2:33:50] <%Tearonex> I managed to beat FTL once ever...
[2:34:00] <Dr_Mooose> I get to the end every time, then die
[2:34:01] <%Hammerknife> FTL's final boss was kind of a waste of time. the game is beatable but requires RNG luck
[2:34:02] <bazing888> @AngriestPat Hey mate first time watching your stream! You planning on playing Sekiro?
[2:34:03] <%ThePuddingDead> @Estuko naw man, i have Self Respect ;D
[2:34:07] <%Ninestempest> @zamzoph dude you can beat FTL with a ton of builds
[2:34:09] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Everyone I know start at easy in this game, it's a great way to learn, and it's not a cakewalk
[2:34:11] <%Niney_Who> That's good
[2:34:14] <%rytyoung> pLaY SeKIrO oN eAsY mOdE To gEt ThE hAnG oF iT
[2:34:23] <DocMadfox> @bazing888 He beat Skiro
[2:34:24] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[2:34:25] <NumberTooBig> that item may help with that controller aiming you got going on there
[2:34:28] <%lewdskeletor13> @bazing888 He streamed all of Sekiro! You can check out his VODs at his YouTube channel
[2:34:29] <@SSaryn> Eyyyy Chrononbauble is easily one of my new favorite items.
[2:34:37] <%PaladinDupre> @doc_ock_rokc @ArcanumMBD @Ninestempest thanks, this just really doesnt seem like my kinda gig. And Im sad Pat isnt gonna play Heat Signature
[2:34:37] <%NWR_James> Yea but are you going PLAY it
[2:34:42] <bazing888> Awesome nice
[2:34:42] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat But when's Sekiro tho
[2:34:47] <NeroInfinite> ...
[2:34:50] <%voidthieff> Pat you got this man I believe in you
[2:34:52] <DocMadfox> When Marvel?
[2:34:52] <SulfurousAcid> how you liking RoR2?
[2:34:56] <%kewlmyc> kewlmyc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Give Elmo big pets
[2:34:56] <CptBritches> Yeah, but when are you going to play Sekiro's easy mode?
[2:34:57] <london_flexing> @ThePuddingDead No one in this chat has self-respect. Quit lying.
[2:34:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PaladinDupre Key
[2:34:59] <+Estuko> DATTEBAYO - woolie
[2:35:03] <Papafleish> is this just like an infinite combat arena
[2:35:03] <%FrustratedAF> you can find pat's sekiro archives on youtube HeyGuys
[2:35:04] <%ArcanumMBD> @PaladinDupre that's fair. It's definitely not a game for everyone. Heat Signature is fucking rad though
[2:35:06] <%rytyoung> @angriestpat I don't believe you it's only been out for a week and a bit
[2:35:07] <%ThePuddingDead> @london_flexing ;3
[2:35:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PaladinDupre kay
[2:35:10] <%spiritofmojave> how about that DMC2 stream, the one game missing out of your archive work
[2:35:12] <%Niney_Who> Healing Drone is good
[2:35:14] <MrGarettLefebvre> With The Surge free on PS Plus, do you think you'd check it out again and see if they made any improvements?
[2:35:14] <Parapattern> sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[2:35:15] <%nmaten> mad cuz bad
[2:35:19] <@SSaryn> That's understandable.
[2:35:20] <InvaderKAZ> Shoot them more with your gun
[2:35:21] <%Niney_Who> Coward Item
[2:35:21] <XeloGel> @AngriestPat you play more you get better
[2:35:22] <@Mechz71> Yeah stream DMC2
[2:35:23] <%GoldeNOVA> Play on Drizzle! It's a hard game!
[2:35:27] <@SSaryn> EYYYY STEALTHKIT
[2:35:28] <Parapattern> Everyone is MAD bad at it at first
[2:35:28] <SchlongKongEduardo> :) u good
[2:35:28] <%BigNerdSam> Does anyone ever leave a livestream going, forget that it's a lovestream, and think that it's a VOD?
[2:35:29] <+Arathiun> its really rough solo
[2:35:29] <NumberTooBig> as a multiplayer game its very fun
[2:35:31] <+ArtemisCroc> me mad because me just started playing hard game and not good right away
[2:35:35] <%Hammerknife> IIRC the biggest problem with FTL is that if your strategy is to board and kill the enemy crew the final boss literally didn't care
[2:35:36] <+theKingRamses> you're doing pretty well for basically jumping in blind
[2:35:36] <+Nexoosen> Thats litterally why people were suggesting drizzle ;_;
[2:35:40] <NumberTooBig> pats just playinng the game wrong Kappa
[2:35:42] <SunsetJack> Yo, I started this game dieing on the first stage many times until I got better so don't worry.
[2:35:43] <natebud> Big advice: start the boss, run far away.
[2:35:44] <CptBritches> It really doesn't take long to get to the point where you are getting to the end zone pretty much every run, honestly.
[2:35:45] <%rytyoung> ooh impromptu dmc2 stream would be hilarious
[2:35:45] <@SSaryn> @parapattern Wont matter, just lowers difficultly forecast timer
[2:35:47] <%Hammerknife> boarding ships can't do dick against the final boss
[2:35:50] <%PaladinDupre> @ArcanumMBD I adore heat signature
[2:35:51] <Davion_Salkovich> "I seem bad but i'm not going to play the difficulty that's meant to learn the game"
[2:35:53] <foreverN2dust> @Mechz71 chaos legion and cross code first
[2:35:54] <sileo_patronus> It's useful until you realize you have no idea what 'heavy damage' means
[2:35:54] <%Niney_Who> Don't open another Orange chest
[2:35:56] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat its only frustrating because commando sucks
[2:35:59] <%NeonTurnip> @AngriestPat a lot of people are coming into this game with knowledge from the first game
[2:36:00] <DocMadfox> I'd kinda like to see Pat play Tropico 6, if only for the complete confusion.
[2:36:02] <%ArcanumMBD> @BigNerdSam I've paused a stream before and then been confused when it didn't resume where I left it
[2:36:06] <%myguymrdruthers> myguymrdruthers subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:36:06] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat I think the idea is that you need to always be moving or else you'll get swarmed. Hit and run tactics.
[2:36:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Guys it’s fine. Let him figure it out at his own pace
[2:36:15] <+gogozeppli> rippppp
[2:36:17] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Trades a random item for the dispalyed item
[2:36:20] <@SSaryn> Well that was good at least
[2:36:20] <%NeonTurnip> slugs better
[2:36:21] <%skizzuto> that was a worthwhile trade
[2:36:22] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat trade item for item shown
[2:36:22] <CptBritches> This will take a random item and output the item it shows over and over so you can stack it
[2:36:23] <NumberTooBig> upgrade at least
[2:36:23] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat can be used repeatedly
[2:36:24] <%Niney_Who> That just took your Heal item and exchanged it
[2:36:25] <XeloGel> ehh medkit not that great
[2:36:25] <%duneblythe> if you are bad you could play on an easier setting
[2:36:26] <Onamar> Slug is better
[2:36:27] <+Dycroma> rip medkit
[2:36:28] <rosemon5001> item exchange
[2:36:28] <+gogozeppli> good healing for garbo healing
[2:36:28] <Fujiwara_92> trade itens
[2:36:29] <+ArtemisCroc> yes
[2:36:29] <%skizzuto> yes
[2:36:30] <SunsetJack> Yea
[2:36:30] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat trades items for a guaranteed item of the same rarity, several items are fucking incredible when stacked
[2:36:30] <natebud> Looks like a muncher
[2:36:31] <FirewallStorm> YES
[2:36:31] <reonome> so you can stack a ton of items
[2:36:31] <ItsKitKat_> man commando is not as good as he is in 1
[2:36:33] <InvaderKAZ> You trade random commons for the displayed item
[2:36:33] <%Halowood> Trade an item of teh same rarity for whatever the printer spits out
[2:36:33] <%Typhaeon> It's a trade
[2:36:34] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat can sometimes be incredibly good items in 3d printers
[2:36:34] <%voidthieff> SLUG POGGERS
[2:36:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Weird thing, I don't think I ever played this game, but the title for some reason made me think that it was some kind of Survival game a la Rust or Ark
[2:36:34] <+ArtemisCroc> it's an item trader
[2:36:35] <@SSaryn> You sacrifice a random item for the item in the 3d Printer
[2:36:35] <Cymen90> @angriestpat I would love to see you play some more FOR HONOR sometime
[2:36:35] <%skizzuto> item trade
[2:36:35] <CptBritches> So you can stack a ridiculous amount and get insane bonus
[2:36:36] <%Halowood> so you can stack items
[2:36:36] <%Niney_Who> You got a better one anyways
[2:36:36] <lloyddboy> item exchange
[2:36:36] <+JavaManJoJo> you trade an item for another
[2:36:37] <dipstere> you swapped an item
[2:36:38] <LtThunderbolt> yep
[2:36:38] <%velemi> Yes and got a better one
[2:36:40] <TwinBat> how can this be!
[2:36:41] <+smevvster> It trades a random item of same rarity for the item displayed on the printer
[2:36:44] <+Estuko> put the slug in your mouth to heal
[2:36:44] <+theKingRamses> if the printer has a good item you recognize, you can spam those things for a bunch of them
[2:36:46] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat that printer is garbage, but you can get some that are crit chance, or attack speed, and go all in on those, it's great
[2:36:48] <@SSaryn> But you high rolled so hey
[2:36:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> takes a random item and gives you similar item
[2:36:49] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat so you can get a bunch of one specific item for BIG STACKS
[2:36:49] <InvaderKAZ> And you can stack items so the effect is greater
[2:36:50] <+ShakeNDake> it takes items and gives you another. you can break runs by stacking certain items
[2:36:58] <%lewdskeletor13> What if you needed that item later tho??? Kappa
[2:37:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> its great when it has leach seed in it
[2:37:02] <SulfurousAcid> go pray
[2:37:08] <+reddpop_> Pat seems to hate this :(
[2:37:09] <TwinBat> this is the most paige stream without paige I've seen on this channel
[2:37:10] <+Arathiun> I didnt like commando at all, i played the easier mode just to unlock more characters and had more fun with it @AngriestPat
[2:37:11] <CptBritches> You were looking at the teleporter earlier
[2:37:12] <XeloGel> and heres the part where new players find annyoing.......the teleporter
[2:37:15] <+SimplesRock> Hey pat, I’m doing some research fun tonight. What are your off the cuff thoughts on artificial intelligence and, if you’ve heard of it, artificial super intelligence?
[2:37:16] <SunsetJack> Converts a random item you have of that SPECIFIC TIER to the that item.
[2:37:17] <%Ninestempest> @SSaryn i once found a 3d printer with the crit glasses in a game with 4 of us playing. we all had 100% crit
[2:37:17] <%rytyoung> aight guys time to hit the hay, peace @angriestpat and chat!
[2:37:17] <NeroInfinite> You got a passive regen by exhcangign your medkit
[2:37:19] <rosemon5001> walking straight away from it lol
[2:37:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's like the damn mystery box in cod zombie mode hmm
[2:37:27] <Karhax> Will-o-wisp 3d printer is legit
[2:37:31] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> pat youve seen it already
[2:37:31] <+ArtemisCroc> look for the embers my dude
[2:37:32] <reonome> next time ping the teleporter
[2:37:32] <Cymen90> @reddpop_ I mean....the original is clearly superior in many ways
[2:37:34] <NumberTooBig> isnt there a giant beacon of particle effects above the teleporter
[2:37:35] <foreverN2dust> I feel like this could use a map of sorts
[2:37:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @rytyoung Good night!
[2:37:36] <%spiritofmojave> Any roguelite that lets you stack good shit to emphasize builds is pretty decent in my book
[2:37:39] <energywarning> teleporter was in the water pit
[2:37:41] <%lewdskeletor13> @rytyoung Night dude
[2:37:41] <@SSaryn> @ninestempest You bet your ass whenever you find Lensmakers you better chance that shit everytime
[2:37:47] <startstoprepeat> backup mag 3d printer on merc is love
[2:37:48] <%Ninestempest> Yeaaaaaap
[2:37:51] <SchlongKongEduardo> is this game just survival or is there a destination?
[2:37:51] <+Nexoosen> sticky bomb/glasses 3d printer Kreygasm
[2:37:53] <%ArcanumMBD> DONT DO IT
[2:37:53] <%deviljhojho94> Folks what is this game about even? I see threads about them on v all the time
[2:37:53] <giga_bit> Did Pat ever play the first Risk of Rain?
[2:37:54] <CptBritches> Pat look for the orange fireflies that surround the teleporter in the air
[2:38:00] <%voidthieff> DO IT
[2:38:02] <SunsetJack> Don't spend your lunar coins.
[2:38:06] <%ArcanumMBD> newt shrine is worthless with how few coins you have
[2:38:08] <TwinBat> he played it once and died and stopped
[2:38:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @giga_bit No
[2:38:10] <Cymen90> @giga_bit yeah but he didn’t like it
[2:38:10] <%ElenaManetta> This grass texture is an eyesore
[2:38:16] <NeroInfinite> squeak
[2:38:19] <sileo_patronus> squeaky
[2:38:21] <+trashamn> the blue money
[2:38:22] <%ArcanumMBD> Lunar coin = purple dollar
[2:38:23] <%skizzuto> the purple money in the top left
[2:38:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> You are doing fine
[2:38:26] <XeloGel> guys stop telling everything at once
[2:38:27] <CptBritches> It's a permanent currency that randomly drops
[2:38:28] <%spiritofmojave> @deviljhojho94 haven't played a Risk of Rain, but more or less wave survival with some RNG/item-building mechanics looks like
[2:38:32] <Fujiwara_92> blue money is lunar coin
[2:38:32] <%Mekhet09> It's the 1 you have under your gold.
[2:38:33] <+gogozeppli> save 11 coins for new character
[2:38:34] <SunsetJack> You have a second currency below your top. It has a purple dollar sign icon.
[2:38:34] <+Nexoosen> lunar coins is the purple $
[2:38:34] <+theKingRamses> lunar coins are rare currency that an enemy can drop, don't worry about that stuff now
[2:38:35] <%BioApple> @deviljhojho94 /v/ RoR threads are weird because they play the game in a really specific way that's geared around high-person multiplayer
[2:38:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Bitcoins for the moon?
[2:38:40] <a_mad_dragon> lunar gascoigne
[2:38:41] <@SSaryn> The weird blue thing you saw uses Lunar coins, dont worry about it for now and keep collecting them
[2:38:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I feel like having a swarm up your ass at all times is inhibiting Pat's learning experience
[2:38:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat occasionally enmies will drop blue coins that you can keep after you die
[2:38:53] <%deviljhojho94> @TheSpiritof2277 Seems about right
[2:38:53] <mr_slaide> We demand ELMO!
[2:38:53] <%Niney_Who> That's a good item
[2:38:54] <SunsetJack> It can be carried to multiple run so don't worry about them.
[2:38:59] <%Ninestempest> aw yeah leech seed
[2:39:02] <%ArcanumMBD> god so many enemies
[2:39:10] <Cymen90> Man, after the 3D novelty wears off, this looks WAY more boring than the original
[2:39:10] <XeloGel> 3 lvl easy already huh
[2:39:12] <%ThePuddingDead> well that missile barrage was flaccid
[2:39:12] <%Ninestempest> oh my god pat has been spawning so much shit
[2:39:15] <%skizzuto> damn that's a lot of wisps
[2:39:15] <%deviljhojho94> @BioApple yeah for a long long time I tought it was multiplayer. Serves me right for paying attention to v i suposse tomatoBWL
[2:39:16] <NumberTooBig> and he's got this run in the bag... maybe LUL
[2:39:16] <%ArcanumMBD> I hate how PAat ignores so many enemies lmao
[2:39:18] <%lewdskeletor13> I can’t believe Pat Killed Elmo live on stream earlier
[2:39:20] <SchlongKongEduardo> woah
[2:39:21] <tetriata> @Reizie_Etherealm There's always a swarm up your ass in this game, so it's par for the course
[2:39:23] <%Hilleltaco> Legally distinct seed of leeching
[2:39:23] <mr_slaide> We love you, ELMO!!!!
[2:39:25] <+trashamn> Lech seed is so good
[2:39:28] <rosemon5001> yep avoid the teleporter like a plaque
[2:39:31] <reonome> GIT GUD
[2:39:31] <+gogozeppli> its impossible to die now
[2:39:38] <InvaderKAZ> You got plenty of stuff you can destroy the boss
[2:39:38] <%Hammerknife> @Cymen90 there's a lot of charm in 2d that goes away in this
[2:39:39] <%deviljhojho94> just do it
[2:39:40] <NeroInfinite> you have ez mode on with that plus the regen
[2:39:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @trashamn its the best on comando
[2:39:41] <%Ninestempest> You have to kill shit while going around pat
[2:39:43] <giga_bit> Just do it good
[2:39:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat gotta stop ignoring the enemies for so long. They just keep building up
[2:39:46] <SpaceCatStation> you just do
[2:39:47] <reonome> YOU GIT GUD
[2:39:47] <natebud> You run far away, fight the small enemies then fight the boss @AngriestPat
[2:39:48] <foreverN2dust> kill them as they pop up
[2:39:48] <Fujiwara_92> clean the adds, they're infinite but take time to repawn
[2:39:48] <%Niney_Who> Because you ignore them all
[2:39:48] <lizard0tm> Almost like there's a multiplayer
[2:39:51] <Sitromxe> Just kite them away.
[2:39:52] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Look at all those enemies! This party is getting crazy! Let's run!
[2:39:52] <FirewallStorm> its git gud
[2:39:52] <CptBritches> You shouldn't actually kill everything
[2:39:55] <XeloGel> @Cymen90 he's not even at the part where you dodge 50 bullets at the same time as 6 bosses come out
[2:39:55] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Upgrades... or different characters
[2:39:56] <DetroitSentai> Kill while looting, then they dont swarm up
[2:39:56] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat killing enemies also gives you XP which increases base HP and damage
[2:39:57] <+ArtemisCroc> you're supposed to manage them, not just run forever
[2:39:57] <%Tucker0603> murder everyone in sight
[2:40:03] <startstoprepeat> you're ideally only supposed to spend a couple minutes on the first area, but if you put it on an easier difficulty you could stay longer
[2:40:09] <Cymen90> @angriestpat think of it as serious Sam. Kill all the enemies
[2:40:11] <giga_bit> THERE, where those floating orange particles are!
[2:40:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Shouldn’t the game balance depending on if you’re doing multiplayer or not?
[2:40:13] <%Niney_Who> Thin the Herd
[2:40:13] <@Mechz71> I think if you don't die you will win the game
[2:40:14] <lloyddboy> keep using missiles
[2:40:15] <DancePad_on_VHS> >Ignores all enemies >How am I supposed to fight the boss with all these enemies
[2:40:15] <reonome> its a balance
[2:40:15] <mr_slaide> That's because people are morons.
[2:40:16] <starotter70> Do it tho
[2:40:18] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat don't worry you'll learn
[2:40:22] <%nmaten> dont kill everything doesnt mean kill nothing
[2:40:22] <%Mekhet09> Oh no.
[2:40:23] <@SSaryn> @angriestpat You should really only be spending 3-5 minutes on a given level. Get 2-5 items, keep going.
[2:40:23] <+ArtemisCroc> they don't respawn, they keep spawning
[2:40:23] <CptBritches> The point isn't to kill everything, just kill stuff until you get your money and then get stuff then get out
[2:40:26] <+KSabot> this seems like a bad game to be neurotic and play
[2:40:26] <InvaderKAZ> Just feel it out
[2:40:26] <flubber3d> HANDLE IT
[2:40:26] <hulkster95> Kill for enough money
[2:40:28] <%ThePuddingDead> good luck
[2:40:29] <+TamJamming> Let Pat play and learn
[2:40:29] <Monkeyweed21> you need to thin the herd
[2:40:31] <SunsetJack> Battlequeen again woah
[2:40:31] <jagaloaf> Use your rockets, they're homing
[2:40:32] <JDebss> You got dis
[2:40:32] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat There are many. many schools of thought.
[2:40:34] <Fujiwara_92> moderation pat, kill with moderation
[2:40:34] <+Haarute> Don't stay in one place to fight the boss, run around in order to avoid damage.
[2:40:35] <+theKingRamses> ROUND 3
[2:40:36] <+ArtemisCroc> you need to kill or they get too much to manage
[2:40:37] <%Niney_Who> Cause now here they all come
[2:40:39] <+BaronEgo> You only kill the amount that you feel/know that you need
[2:40:40] <%FrustratedAF> welllll fuck
[2:40:42] <%NeonTurnip> @AngriestPat ignore us honestly too many people trying to give advice that dont know what they are talking about
[2:40:47] <+gogozeppli> kill the boss my dude
[2:40:48] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat There are many idiots in chat. Pay attention to ssaryn if anything
[2:40:49] <%Niney_Who> Stop standing so close
[2:40:53] <reonome> there's a tell
[2:40:54] <Ner234> Chat is NOT a good source of advice for most things. Especially not a game like this.
[2:40:55] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Kill what spawns, don't ignore everything, but don't spend all your time only killing. It's a balancing act
[2:40:57] <natebud> Enemies stop respawning a little while after you activate the teleporter. @AngriestPat
[2:40:57] <zamzoph> F
[2:40:57] <CptBritches> You learn its tell and roll
[2:40:59] <%Aztec50> this is basically just grinding until you feel comfortable taking on the boss
[2:40:59] <InvaderKAZ> Big RIP
[2:40:59] <Parapattern> FUCK
[2:40:59] <%Laecerelius> When it vomits roll towards it
[2:41:00] <%Tucker0603> run away
[2:41:01] <XeloGel> @AngriestPat Pat you get awarded for going fast and getting items efficiently that is it. you should of just played the game without advice
[2:41:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[2:41:01] <ItsKitKat_> @AngriestPat Do you have anyone you know to help you to learn? this is definatly not the type of game to learn on the fly unless you wanna take hours
[2:41:02] <startstoprepeat> you have iframes on your dodge, just time it
[2:41:02] <+gogozeppli> fuck the adds just dps the boss
[2:41:03] <Onamar> Roll towards it
[2:41:04] <Knoxx_Gold> F
[2:41:05] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat It's like an RPG or MMO, you have to do Crowd Control on the adds and not tunnel vision the boss.
[2:41:06] <flubber3d> darn
[2:41:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:41:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:08] <+theKingRamses> i think with that attack it's just outrange it a bit
[2:41:08] <SchlongKongEduardo> ur doing it :)
[2:41:09] <%Mythicalbrit> just tell him to unlock them by using the game files so he can just enjoy the game
[2:41:12] <+gogozeppli> your multi shot stuns
[2:41:12] <$cureneckbeard> The general idea is you have to fight monstesr and get stuff until you are strong enough to fight the boss, then activate the boss. But the longer you spend, the harder enemies get and the harder the boss will be.
[2:41:13] <MrGarettLefebvre> What a shitty game
[2:41:14] <sileo_patronus> Don't be in front of the beetle queen if you desire to not die
[2:41:14] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Ninestempest) (warning)
[2:41:15] <giga_bit> @startstoprepeat Actually, the roll has no iframes.
[2:41:16] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Play on Drizzle or go on MP and see how people do
[2:41:16] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Thin the herd of ignored enemies, space yourself away from bosses
[2:41:17] <Maleicus> invisible corpse
[2:41:17] <+Haarute> @AngriestPat DON'T fight a horder of 200 enemies in an open field. Run around and get good positions.
[2:41:18] <Fujiwara_92> frustration is getting bigger
[2:41:20] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat To be frank, the game is fairly unapproachable without some kind of reliable guiding hand.
[2:41:21] <%masneo2> this game is weird
[2:41:22] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat for that wave shot, try rolling forward... not sure if it'll work
[2:41:22] <Vyctorian> Hello
[2:41:25] <InvaderKAZ> Pat I really want you to see what late game looks like
[2:41:25] <%baingori> baingori subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:41:26] <%spiritofmojave> It looks like the roll functions like it would in Gungeon, gives you i-frames
[2:41:26] <mlmach6> jump around @AngriestPat
[2:41:26] <startstoprepeat> @giga_bit oh, for real? my bad
[2:41:26] <Cymen90> @angriestpat play it like Serious Sam with objectives
[2:41:27] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat try learning it on easy so you know how the game works!
[2:41:28] <mr_slaide> We love you, ELMO!!!!
[2:41:28] <hulkster95> My advice would be to fight further away
[2:41:29] <+ShakeNDake> wile you are going round and getting chest, every once and a while, you gotta thin the ads out. you cant kill everything, but taking it from 30 to 10 is important.
[2:41:30] <Parapattern> Pat BIG hate this game
[2:41:30] <%spiritofmojave> I'd exploit that
[2:41:34] <CptBritches> GOOD BOY
[2:41:34] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat you know those flying enemies, they shoot you :)
[2:41:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Killing enemies also gives XP. Levelling up increases HP and Damage
[2:41:35] <%lewdskeletor13> apatFist apatFist apatFist apatFist
[2:41:36] <TwinBat> emotional support cat
[2:41:37] <starotter70> sipsipElmo
[2:41:39] <DocMadfox> Pet the cat
[2:41:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> did pat died???
[2:41:42] <Saltmeisterr> lets just play hades lol
[2:41:44] <sukiyakiwestern> cant wait to see where this week takes us Kappa
[2:41:46] <viciousgrim> invite someone to play
[2:41:47] <natebud> @AngriestPat activate the boss, ignore the boss, kill the small enemies first. They will stop respawning eventually.
[2:41:47] <+gogozeppli> run to the tele after 1 items and wrock the boss with no adds around
[2:41:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat please do multiplayer it really makes it easier
[2:41:47] <%lewdskeletor13> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[2:41:47] <flubber3d> ask kitty for advice
[2:41:47] <CptBritches> Let Elmo play already!
[2:41:49] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat you can unlock characters by messing with game files there are guides on it
[2:41:51] <%Hammerknife> i'll be honest, i've only ever played RoR1/2 in multiplayer. I can't imagine it's all that fun in single player
[2:41:52] <%FrustratedAF> i bet you'll have more fun with dead cells tomorrow Jebaited
[2:41:55] <%spiritofmojave> apatWink apatWink
[2:41:55] <Ir_ramble> pet Elmo and win game
[2:41:55] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat play on drizzle until you unlock literally any other character, commando is completely awful in solo and literally any other character will be playable in solo
[2:41:55] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat The game got an update just now if you are interested.
[2:41:57] <jacknerik> KITTTY
[2:41:57] <DocMadfox> Petting Elmo means you win
[2:41:58] <Monkeyweed21> you need to clear adds or you get overwhelmed
[2:41:59] <@SSaryn> @angriestpat A lot of chat doesnt really know what they're talking about. spend 3-5 minutes on a given level, get 2-5 items or so, and keep going. At a certain point with so many enemies, you will just die.
[2:42:01] <+Dycroma> you have to kill enemies for gold, find items, and also fight the boss in a reasonable amount of time otherwise the difficulty timer goes too far up
[2:42:02] <%lewdskeletor13> We love Elmo!
[2:42:05] <Twoiis> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[2:42:05] <SpaceCatStation> look at that 10/10 friend
[2:42:06] <foreverN2dust> @FrustratedAF he hates dead cells
[2:42:09] <$cureneckbeard> Elmo is my emotional support.
[2:42:10] <dsauce999> I can see what pat means by conflicting advice..."Focus the adds", "Fuck the adds, fight the boss only'
[2:42:11] <%Hammerknife> these kinds of games aren't built to be enjoyed single player
[2:42:12] <flubber3d> :D
[2:42:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat try a hybrid control sceme.... no joke, that's hat I use and it's baller
[2:42:20] <%XeroVI> don't kill all the enemies, but thin the heard a little
[2:42:22] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Try learning on multiplayer. Let veterans of the game show you how to play through osmosis.
[2:42:23] <aimlesshealer> Chat is a stupid
[2:42:24] <tetriata> Pat playing multiplayer will probably even worse. He will just be dragged into later levels and get dumpstered even harder than he is now
[2:42:24] <Ir_ramble> PRESS [X] TO ELMO
[2:42:28] <Fujiwara_92> listen to @ssaryn @angriestpat
[2:42:28] <mr_slaide> Chat are morons.
[2:42:28] <lloyddboy> X
[2:42:30] <$cureneckbeard> X
[2:42:31] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> stay further away
[2:42:33] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Stay back from her. Being close means her spit hits like a shotgun
[2:42:34] <InvaderKAZ> Your roll has iframes
[2:42:34] <@Mechz71> I on the other hand have not bought this game and I know how to play it perfectly
[2:42:35] <CptBritches> There absolutely is a very clear tell
[2:42:36] <+trashamn> ELOM
[2:42:36] <+Sxy_T_Rex> 死
[2:42:37] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat there is no damage drop off, so you can just stay further away
[2:42:38] <sambone_z> stay further away from her
[2:42:40] <%ArcanumMBD> Beetle Queen has not great telegraphs
[2:42:40] <Dr_Mooose> Elmo "feed me hair"
[2:42:41] <FirewallStorm> you are to close
[2:42:44] <BoBoCatBurger> @angriestpat try to be efficient and keep everything at a manageable level
[2:42:45] <DocMadfox> You win by petting Elmo
[2:42:45] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat Game got a patch, it improved teleporter hint.
[2:42:48] <%voidthieff> Yea what they said i am a moron
[2:42:49] <%Ninestempest> You don't need to be 2 feet away lol
[2:42:51] <Karhax> don't stand so close
[2:42:51] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat she can only throw acid if you're in front of her
[2:42:53] <iamnolionheart> If you can see when she shoots the spray, you can move forward or back to dodge it instead of sideways
[2:42:53] <natebud> Run far away from the boss
[2:42:56] <sambone_z> just shoot her from farther
[2:42:56] <+ShakeNDake> @Ninestempest yes there is
[2:42:56] <iamnolionheart> Since it's a line
[2:42:57] <dsauce999> "Your roll has iframes" "the roll has no iframes"
[2:43:00] <DetroitSentai> Keep your distance and the attacks are easier to avoid by moving towards or away
[2:43:01] <%ArcanumMBD> @SunsetJack he's playing on that patch already
[2:43:02] <mr_slaide> See, Voidthieff knows what's what.
[2:43:02] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat also the real strategy is to run from chest to chest fighting enemies until you can buy them
[2:43:05] <foreverN2dust> How far can you shoot in this?
[2:43:06] <SunsetJack> Is he?
[2:43:09] <%Ninestempest> @ShakeNDake not enough that he can't be more than 2 feet away my dude
[2:43:10] <SunsetJack> I just got the update now
[2:43:12] <%Kareem405> her tell is green bugs from her mouth
[2:43:14] <Cymen90> @angriestpat you have guns. No reason to be so close
[2:43:14] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah, the outline is really faint
[2:43:16] <+Haarute> Don't take that fight head on. You have guns, so keep your distance and maybe hide behind environment while thinning adds.
[2:43:17] <+theKingRamses> keep away from the boss but try to stay in the teleporter chargy dome thing
[2:43:20] <%spiritofmojave> The roll has sometimes i-frames Kappa
[2:43:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @foreverN2dust Forever but it has drop off for the most part
[2:43:23] <FirewallStorm> her spit is like a shotgun and you will get blasted if you stay to close
[2:43:28] <ButterscotchSoda> @AngriestPat dont need to be so close to bosses, you have infinite range as commando
[2:43:30] <FirewallStorm> so stay back
[2:43:38] <%Ninestempest> LUL warbanner
[2:43:40] <sambone_z> you can it those big dinosaur bird things in the distance
[2:43:43] <CptBritches> GREAT STRENGTH
[2:43:46] <energywarning> good luck, i'm behind 20 warbanners
[2:43:53] <+ArtemisCroc> warbanner is an incredible item in the original
[2:43:53] <Fujiwara_92> "kill everything" "don't kill everything" "play fast" "don't play that fast" chat today geez OpieOP
[2:43:54] <reonome> warbanner is gud shit
[2:43:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Varian ability from Heroes of the Storm?
[2:44:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> The music is fucking MOOD
[2:44:01] <Karhax> great strength = 30%
[2:44:01] <%XeroVI> if you get overwhelmed, just run away and deal with things from a distance
[2:44:03] <%voidthieff> @mr_slaide apatDab
[2:44:04] <Parapattern> Be the BIG strong
[2:44:06] <foreverN2dust> does he know you level up if you kill enouh?
[2:44:08] <@Mechz71> these guns sound like fucking ass
[2:44:09] <%FrustratedAF> i blame the game being new AND early access
[2:44:14] <%Ninestempest> Chat isn't sure cause the game is new and 100% optimal decisions aren't made yet
[2:44:16] <%Jaxnos> i just came into the stream and this is one of the weirder looking games I've seen.
[2:44:17] <CptBritches> Warbanner near the teleporter as Engi on both your turrets is the best feeling
[2:44:19] <sileo_patronus> @Fujiwara_92 "why isn't chat a hivemind?"
[2:44:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GUNxSPECTRE You don't even know the music is electric
[2:44:24] <+breakdancinghobo> I just came in. is Pat having fun with this game? he doesnt look like it
[2:44:33] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[2:44:36] <+trashamn> NICE
[2:44:38] <reonome> pat is also aiming with a controller LUL
[2:44:47] <@SSaryn> Rose Buckler can be nice honestly
[2:44:48] <%Jaxnos> like i can't tell what im watching
[2:44:49] <Fujiwara_92> @sileo_patronus it is tho... Just a confused hive mind
[2:44:52] <+gogozeppli> nothing feels worse than seeing people say a good game is shit because of this stream
[2:44:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm guessing you unlock a new character by beating the boss?
[2:44:56] <%skizzuto> Pat's frustrated he can't beat the first level
[2:44:59] <reonome> rose buckler is only good on huntress tbh
[2:44:59] <%Ninestempest> rose buckler better with huntress tbh
[2:44:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this game seem,s kinda lame
[2:45:01] <GUNxSPECTRE> Also, probably prioritize shooter enemies?
[2:45:04] <%Aztec50> to be fair i dont think this character is nice for learning cause it seems clunky
[2:45:04] <+Nexoosen> I just want pat to like the thing I like BibleThump
[2:45:07] <%Ninestempest> @reonome lol
[2:45:09] <+theKingRamses> the turret's not great but if you have a boatload of cash, it can thin out those adds following you
[2:45:10] <reonome> @Ninestempest jinx
[2:45:13] <%Ninestempest> D:
[2:45:16] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah, you need to focus more on emeies that can shoot you
[2:45:21] <natebud> leveling up upgrades your damage, that blue bar
[2:45:22] <sileo_patronus> Warbanner technically does
[2:45:23] <+ArtemisCroc> beetles can't shoot
[2:45:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That's why I say that hybrid is the way to play this game.... Aim with mouse, move with stick
[2:45:24] <StaticSunrise> damage increases with level
[2:45:27] <Saltmeisterr> I don't like how u just get swarmed by ads
[2:45:27] <+reddpop_> Your damage increases as you level up too
[2:45:31] <%Niney_Who> Your warbanner does technically
[2:45:35] <Twoiis> Seems more like a side grade from ror1. Is that the case?
[2:45:38] <%Ninestempest> @Bane_Kaikyo woolie go to sleep
[2:45:39] <troxcree> You want to stack as much of Paul's goat hoof as you can.
[2:45:41] <InvaderKAZ> You don't really need items for that, leveling up boosts damage yeah
[2:45:42] <@SSaryn> @ninestempest MUL-T has well to be fair, just helps with his dash
[2:45:43] <ScrapSentinel> dont forget to spam your abilities, they do plenty of damage
[2:45:44] <SchlongKongEduardo> chill tune
[2:45:44] <Saltmeisterr> shooting u from off screen and shit
[2:45:45] <Caidezes> I'll be honest, this looks super bland to play.
[2:45:46] <%Jaxnos> music is pretty good though
[2:45:48] <CptBritches> At least the music keeps you relaxed even when getting shit on
[2:45:50] <foreverN2dust> It is good
[2:45:51] <%Niney_Who> Soldier Syringe is godtier
[2:45:51] <reonome> syringe is very good
[2:45:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Reizie_Etherealm If you beat level 1 5 times you get mul-t if you get past level 3 you get huntress if you get to the end you get merc if you get 11 lunar gcoins you get artificer
[2:45:54] <%Ninestempest> That is also true
[2:45:57] <+reddpop_> Syringe is very good
[2:45:57] <%skizzuto> syringe is good becasue most damage items proc on hit
[2:46:00] <giga_bit> Soldier Syringe is great
[2:46:04] <%FrustratedAF> pat's worst enemy: the syringe
[2:46:05] <Parapattern> These 3D levels seem way too wide open compared to the first game's linear layout
[2:46:08] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat It's probably a good idea to prioritize airborne enemies as they will have an easier time hitting and pathfinding to you.
[2:46:10] <%Ninestempest> @doc_ock_rokc false, if you obliterate yourself you get merc
[2:46:11] <GUNxSPECTRE> DPS is always great
[2:46:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Hard progress lock, gotcha
[2:46:16] <sileo_patronus> I'll have a teleporter please
[2:46:21] <+JavaManJoJo> no shade at Pat, but the game looks bland because Pat keeps dying on the first level, chat.
[2:46:23] <%BioApple> @Ninestempest well, that is the only end as of now
[2:46:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ninestempest yes well its the ending we have now
[2:46:29] <ScrapSentinel> Once you get that difficulty sllider up further, the game gets stupidly intense
[2:46:30] <StrikeTheGiant> this the new Microsoft paint game?
[2:46:40] <%BioApple> and I think huntress is 30 min, not stage 3
[2:46:40] <sileo_patronus> They die faster at least
[2:46:40] <giga_bit> How does Pat feel about like, 5 syringes being jabbed into his character model?
[2:46:42] <+CharredChord> Interested in a multiplayer session?
[2:46:42] <%Ninestempest> I guess? Some people would call getting to level 1 again a thing
[2:46:43] <Lulu19> have you played the first one?
[2:46:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> they are not as hard to hit with THE MOUSE!!
[2:46:44] <troxcree> I sure hope Acrid makes it into the full version.
[2:46:44] <InvaderKAZ> It's easy to aim using mouse and keyboard
[2:46:50] <%voidthieff> @StrikeTheGiant yemen
[2:46:52] <%ThePuddingDead> im getting alot of binding of isaac vibes watching this
[2:46:56] <+Shaggnar> I keep seeing everyone play this, but it really lacks the atmosphere of the 1st game.
[2:46:58] <GUNxSPECTRE> The one thing is that the 1st game had island lvl designs where you can ditch an area, and most enemies just get trapped
[2:46:58] <StrikeTheGiant> lol
[2:47:00] <tetriata> @Parapattern It's kind of sluggish for the first few levels, but unless you're really unlucky, you start getting movement items and you'll start moving very fast very quickly
[2:47:04] <Karhax> Acrid is the coolest guy
[2:47:06] <GUNxSPECTRE> Not the case here apparently
[2:47:06] <ScrapSentinel> Missile Launcher Kreygasm
[2:47:07] <%Ninestempest> PAT LEARNING
[2:47:12] <lejeune> yes it is a roguelike @ThePuddingDead
[2:47:13] <%BestTeaMaker> pat, did you think those were consumables
[2:47:15] <%Niney_Who> Active item boxes yes
[2:47:17] <energywarning> learning and playing and learning
[2:47:39] <GUNxSPECTRE> Also, aiming wasn't a thing in the first game for the most part
[2:47:43] <ButterscotchSoda> @AngriestPat LT resets spread btw
[2:47:45] <Fujiwara_92> play to learn, learn to play SeemsGood
[2:47:55] <+ArtemisCroc> it's happening again lol
[2:47:56] <sileo_patronus> They really need to tweak burning damage though
[2:48:00] <%voidthieff> deso anyone know if the just the chests are randomized or the entire level layout and all?
[2:48:03] <+ArtemisCroc> ignoring the enemies shooting him from behind
[2:48:03] <+bigb00gi3> if you're looking for the teleporter, look for some red particles/"embers" floating around a part of the level
[2:48:03] <+gogozeppli> you need to clear the first stage 5 times or the 3rd stage once for the next character
[2:48:05] <%spiritofmojave> Consumable use is for the weak
[2:48:10] <SulfurousAcid> do warbanners stack?
[2:48:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I can't see Pat's current level but at what level is considered good enough to attempt the boss?
[2:48:18] <energywarning> everything stacks
[2:48:19] <reonome> yes
[2:48:25] <Karhax> you can do the boss right away
[2:48:25] <DetroitSentai> warbanner stacks increase size not damage
[2:48:26] <+gogozeppli> banners grow in size with stacks
[2:48:26] <reonome> nearly everything stacks
[2:48:28] <giga_bit> @voidthieff Map layout is mostly the same with a few variations, chests and stuff are all randomized.
[2:48:28] <%Mekhet09> you should try the shrine of chest.
[2:48:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @energywarning up to 6 times
[2:48:34] <ScrapSentinel> @Reizie_Etherealm you can do it level 1, if you really wanted
[2:48:36] <%Mekhet09> chance.
[2:48:38] <%skizzuto> @Reizie_Etherealm it's more loot dependent rather than level dependent
[2:48:41] <GUNxSPECTRE> Isn't it usually the case that you attempt the boss after looting everything on the map
[2:48:42] <+theKingRamses> you just gotta feel out when the right time to do the boss is
[2:48:44] <%BioApple> @voidthieff levels have the same general layout each time with some minor variations. Big structures like teleporters will show up in one of a few set locations, chests might be totally random i dunno
[2:48:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I see
[2:48:47] <+Nexoosen> @Reizie_Etherealm You CAN do the boss as soon as you load in, just depends on how you play the game
[2:48:48] <startstoprepeat> yeyeye
[2:48:49] <%Ninestempest> does chat know if rusted keys do antying when stacked?
[2:48:56] <StaticSunrise> yes
[2:48:58] <reonome> wait... does pat know about the difficulty timer?
[2:48:59] <DetroitSentai> increase odds of good items
[2:49:00] <StaticSunrise> increase item quality
[2:49:01] <Karhax> rusted keys stacking increase item rarity
[2:49:02] <DetroitSentai> from the rusty chest
[2:49:03] <%skizzuto> rusted keys increase the rarity of the item in the rusted lockbox
[2:49:04] <%Ninestempest> Ah okay, ty
[2:49:06] <giga_bit> @Ninestempest Chance of a higher grade item increases.
[2:49:06] <+Nexoosen> @Ninestempest uincreases rarity of lockbox items
[2:49:07] <%ArcanumMBD> @Ninestempest increases rarity of the item you find
[2:49:07] <energywarning> it's all in the logbook numbers and all
[2:49:12] <+Lionkevinson> Zelda?
[2:49:15] <%Ninestempest> I KNOW CHAT TY
[2:49:15] <GUNxSPECTRE> Drones seem pretty alright too
[2:49:18] <+bigb00gi3> you need a lot of them to actually notice a difference
[2:49:22] <natebud> Its right there
[2:49:23] <+trashamn> LEFt
[2:49:27] <reonome> LEFT
[2:49:31] <%Ninestempest> 7 minutes on level 1, bold move cotton
[2:49:34] <+bigb00gi3> look for some red embers floating around, it can guide you to the tele
[2:49:37] <%Kareem405> pat look for red sparkles
[2:49:40] <Karhax> logbook having accurate numbers is so good
[2:49:44] <giga_bit> Does pat know about the floating portal particles?
[2:49:46] <+Nexoosen> @GUNxSPECTRE They are super good early, but late get blown up aftern because of wandering vagrants
[2:49:54] <natebud> kill the boss LAST @AngriestPat
[2:49:55] <startstoprepeat> ?????
[2:49:55] <%voidthieff> @Ninestempest wuve u apatLiz
[2:49:57] <+Nexoosen> *often
[2:50:01] <%BioApple> why is he getting the beetle every time what is this
[2:50:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> your ood do it
[2:50:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Big rate of fire, small damage
[2:50:06] <sileo_patronus> middle of an open field LUL
[2:50:07] <InvaderKAZ> I believe
[2:50:08] <reonome> pat is always getting beetle queen lol
[2:50:11] <%ThePuddingDead> thats too much
[2:50:13] <+gogozeppli> get back inthe red
[2:50:13] <GUNxSPECTRE> Beetle Queen is a new addition right
[2:50:14] <starotter70> This song's pretty cool
[2:50:14] <+Qsmash_> calm down
[2:50:16] <$Avolver001> kill faster!!
[2:50:22] <Karhax> get in the zone pat
[2:50:24] <%ThePuddingDead> constantly spawning enemies on top of a boss...
[2:50:28] <%skizzuto> beetle queen's better than stone titan imo, that tracking laser is kinda bs if you don't have cover
[2:50:29] <reonome> pat you have to kill the boss
[2:50:29] <SchlongKongEduardo> hm
[2:50:31] <FirewallStorm> stay in the zone
[2:50:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget the missiles!
[2:50:34] <CptBritches> What are you doing
[2:50:40] <+ArtemisCroc> the wisps keep shredding your health
[2:50:42] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Remember, there is no shame in being a huge, cheesy coward.
[2:50:46] <+Estuko> sound like a broken record but those blue lizard t ype guys are cute
[2:50:48] <FantasticHaz> One of the best ways to avoid taking hits is jumping, but having to aim with a controller at the same time might be a serious disadvantage
[2:50:51] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat you should be jumping more to avoid enemy fire
[2:50:51] <+gogozeppli> youre doing nothing but maknig it harder get back in the red if yuor gonna kill
[2:51:03] <$Avolver001> lol
[2:51:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[2:51:07] <+Nexoosen> @AngriestPat try to consider cover, wont be taking as much damage if theres a wall between you and the boss while you deal with ads
[2:51:07] <DavidSanChan> mom sez it's my turn to play
[2:51:08] <giga_bit> lol
[2:51:08] <startstoprepeat> firing missiles directly into the cave roof to try and cause a cave in to kill you faster was a pro strat
[2:51:09] <throwaway9989> SeemsGood
[2:51:10] <%BioApple> i support you pat
[2:51:14] <Fujiwara_92> shits hard
[2:51:15] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Drizzle!
[2:51:17] <PhantaniumOG> pat thats a aoe she puts down standing in it damages you
[2:51:19] <%Aztec50> Raid Mechanics: the Game
[2:51:19] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you don't have to stay in the red circle. If you have to run away and heal, do so.
[2:51:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> don't step on the spit
[2:51:21] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat if you're having a hard time finding the teleporter, there's a faint red sparkle particle effect in an AoE around it
[2:51:25] <@SSaryn> @goldenova Does not into,
[2:51:27] <@Mechz71> This upsets the Pat
[2:51:27] <IMCthulhu> circle strafing the boss ad medium distance while jumping the entire time works well
[2:51:29] <sukiyakiwestern> bii
[2:51:29] <natebud> better
[2:51:30] <GUNxSPECTRE> Wonder if my bro Bandito Shotgun is in the game
[2:51:30] <%spiritofmojave> Believe in Pat! apatDab
[2:51:30] <%Niney_Who> Guys the Red circle isn't an AOE
[2:51:32] <EnlightenedKramer> WE MUST SUPPORT OUR PAT
[2:51:33] <%Niney_Who> That's the Teleporter circle
[2:51:38] <%BestTeaMaker> Staying in the red circle simply charges the teleporter, but being outside of it doesn't affect anything
[2:51:38] <%Mikatonic> why'd you shoot the missiles while under a cave?
[2:51:40] <jagaloaf> Spam more missiles
[2:51:40] <+robcanvas> patface
[2:51:41] <dsauce999> "Run away and kite enemies" "Stay in the zone"
[2:51:41] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, I haven't played this game personally, but I'm with Pat. This seems like a lot
[2:51:41] <energywarning> hug elmo
[2:51:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> how would u rate this game out of 10 pst
[2:51:45] <%Typhaeon> Maybe try one of those drones for the minions that spawn
[2:51:47] <hntronium> You went back in though
[2:51:48] <MonocleCoyote> PAT vs ROGUELIKES
[2:51:48] <@SSaryn> Only lowers the timer
[2:51:49] <+SimplesRock> Look at this background nonsense
[2:51:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> \\[T]// Give pat your energy
[2:51:50] <aimlesshealer> Don't sweat it Pat
[2:51:51] <%Apathiae> I found KB&M much easier for this game
[2:51:51] <mayorrev> chat room raise your hands and give him your energy!!!
[2:51:52] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Her goo also stays on the ground and hurts
[2:51:52] <+gogozeppli> roll has no i frames in this game
[2:51:52] <reonome> pat play multiplayer its easier
[2:51:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> There is nothing wwrong with the easier difficulty @AngriestPat
[2:51:53] <%voidthieff> I BELIEVE IN PAT apatDab apatDab
[2:51:53] <Saltmeisterr> yeah this games seems like way too bs for my tastes
[2:51:54] <throwaway9989> Just tap your foot to the beat
[2:51:54] <%Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat you can unlock characters by messing with game files there are guides on it
[2:51:56] <BlacSoul> Looks like you’re getting better at positioning
[2:51:57] <ScrapSentinel> I wouldn't say this game is hard, its mostly just learning how everything works
[2:51:57] <foreverN2dust> no iframes on the roll
[2:51:58] <mayorrev> \o/ SPIRIT BOMB
[2:51:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> Multiplayer
[2:52:03] <natebud> Looks like they added a field around the teleporter. Enemies stop spawning when the teleporter hits 100%
[2:52:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> Bois will carry
[2:52:06] <Fujiwara_92> plz chat, if you have never played don't give advice Kappa
[2:52:07] <CptBritches> You rolled wayyy too late
[2:52:08] <foreverN2dust> \o/
[2:52:10] <MonocleCoyote> coxDIE coxAGAIN coxDIE coxAGAIN
[2:52:10] <%Aztec50> just do ONE run on Drizzle
[2:52:11] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat I'd take a second to collect yourself, this game feels overwhelming and intended for coop from what some people have mentioned
[2:52:13] <InvaderKAZ> You can do it Pat you just gotta grind it out until you have knowledge
[2:52:13] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat well, I'm out of ideas
[2:52:14] <EnlightenedKramer> \○/
[2:52:14] <%Kduff89> \o/ support chat is a go \o/
[2:52:14] <Saltmeisterr> i literally have no idea why its 3d
[2:52:15] <+reddpop_> You'll get there. If you hate this, dont force it
[2:52:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat her good is a aoe @AngriestPat
[2:52:17] <reonome> @AngriestPat try playing on drizzle or mutiplayer pat
[2:52:20] <Sitromxe> Looks like that multi-shot attack is locked into landing at a certain spot once it is in the air, giving you time to dodge.
[2:52:21] <+SimplesRock> Maybe doing passes at her is the way. Like, run through her and keep going, then do another bombing run
[2:52:22] <sukiyakiwestern> ROLLING HAS NO IFRAMES
[2:52:24] <mayorrev> SPIRIT BOMB CHAT
[2:52:26] <+gogozeppli> rolling has no iframes
[2:52:26] <%BioApple> @natebud tele's locked to 99% if the boss is still up tho
[2:52:28] <mayorrev> \o/
[2:52:30] <%Niney_Who> Rolling has no I-frames it's just a movement ability
[2:52:31] <CptBritches> It also has no iframes, but you did roll too late
[2:52:39] <+NiktenKing> The game isn't hard... it's just too much to manage if you don't know the items... much like Isaac but with Afterbirth as the base instead of Rebirth
[2:52:39] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[2:52:40] <energywarning> circle strafing is pretty good

[2:52:45] <Ir_ramble> this a dark souls?
[2:52:48] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat your evasion moves on every character are mostly for movement, not much for iframes. Use them to get out of the way of things
[2:52:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Gonna got the hay, night y’all
[2:52:50] <%Afterman_> 111111
[2:52:51] <%GoldeNOVA> He refuses to play on Drizzle! apatCanada
[2:52:53] <troxcree> It gives a random item or nothing.
[2:52:54] <al0nem0nster> Risk of Rain was in 2d, Risk of Rain 2 is in 3d, so Obviously Risk of Rain 3 will be in 4d
[2:52:55] <Monkeyweed21> 1
[2:52:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Niney_Who It does have I frames but its at the start
[2:52:57] <%brickwall35> I haven't seen any risk of rain yet

[2:52:58] <%voidthieff> \o/ sprit bomb
[2:52:59] <starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 night
[2:53:00] <CptBritches> LMAO, the enemies are infinite therefore the money is infinite and you just restarted
[2:53:03] <GUNxSPECTRE> Huntress was godlike in the first game
[2:53:11] <+ArtemisCroc> @troxcree No it doesn't lmao
[2:53:20] <%spiritofmojave> night man! @lewdskeletor13
[2:53:20] <Fujiwara_92> @goldenova Drizzle won't help, it was already discussed
[2:53:27] <+ArtemisCroc> there's more than one kind of shrine
[2:53:28] <Junkfist> Risk of Rain 3 was in 4d it traveled back in time to be released in 1982
[2:53:31] <%Aztec50> at least on Drizzle you can get a feel of the flow of the game
[2:53:32] <foreverN2dust> that's not dps :/
[2:53:32] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> Risk of Rain 3 will be VR
[2:53:34] <+gogozeppli> if he plans to take his time it will help
[2:53:36] <tetriata> Yeah huntress is really underwhelming this time around even if she is fun
[2:53:38] <natebud> @BioApple They do stop respawning though. I just can't remember when
[2:53:40] <Monkeyweed21> look for teleporter first then plan accordingly
[2:53:42] <Rhinoprotoss> Getting stuck on the first level
[2:53:43] <Sitromxe> You know what might help Pat out here? If he used 4/4.
[2:53:44] <%voidthieff> @GUNxSPECTRE shes alirght in this game not great nut okay
[2:53:49] <%GoldeNOVA> But it helps

[2:54:10] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat it's just lore, NOT NECESSARY TO UNLOCK
[2:54:11] <+trashamn> oh lore
[2:54:12] <+reddpop_> Just a pricey collectable
[2:54:15] <LtThunderbolt> buy the drone
[2:54:16] <Karhax> unlocking lore is worth it
[2:54:26] <%schlager087> how do I know how many lunar coins I have?
[2:54:32] <tetriata> Huntress needs to be able to sprint sideways
[2:54:35] <+Estuko> probably when he's playing by himself
[2:54:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Top left under the gold?
[2:54:39] <+NiktenKing> It's the purple dollar
[2:54:42] <%BioApple> @schlager087 it's the blue money under the normal money
[2:54:43] <%Niney_Who> You're a lot harder to hit while jumping
[2:54:44] <%skizzuto> @schlager087 purple money under regular money
[2:54:46] <+Nexoosen> @schlager087 the purple $ below your money
[2:54:51] <+gogozeppli> enemies never stop spawning even when you 100% the map a single small enemy will spawn every now and then
[2:54:53] <artoflec> I am not feeling the sound design in this game at all
[2:55:01] <%Ninestempest> yeah the music is really meh
[2:55:03] <SpaceCatStation> no that's good
[2:55:03] <jagaloaf> They stack
[2:55:04] <ScrapSentinel> They stack
[2:55:05] <lizard0tm> Pat needs to jump more, but then that would mess with his aiming I guess
[2:55:05] <%Niney_Who> Pay they stack
[2:55:06] <ScrapSentinel> they're good
[2:55:06] <+smevvster> Tougher Times is great
[2:55:07] <zedravan> they stack
[2:55:07] <reonome> THEY STACK

[2:55:08] <%Mekhet09> They stack.
[2:55:10] <Ner234> They stack
[2:55:11] <Fujiwara_92> they stack
[2:55:11] <GUNxSPECTRE> RNJesus baby
[2:55:12] <natebud> The powerups stack @AngriestPat
[2:55:12] <FantasticHaz> That's some tough times baby
[2:55:12] <Karhax> items stack, it's good to get multiple
[2:55:13] <%schlager087> word been tempted to just run solos till I get 10 for the wizard
[2:55:14] <%cryobyjorn> they stack
[2:55:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @artoflec we are at the start
[2:55:20] <%Halowood> They stack or just 3D print them
[2:55:21] <NeroInfinite> it's good that means higher chance to ignore damage
[2:55:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Saving throws tho
[2:55:22] <sileo_patronus> What's the % on bear anyway?
[2:55:28] <ScrapSentinel> No you need to not die LUL
[2:55:28] <SpaceCatStation> it helps you not die better
[2:55:29] <sukiyakiwestern> BEAR IS GREAT
[2:55:35] <ScrapSentinel> WISP
[2:55:35] <sileo_patronus> You also need to not die to be fair
[2:55:36] <+ArtemisCroc> BEST ITEM
[2:55:37] <ComptonRiot> WISP
[2:55:38] <%Niney_Who> Wisp is great
[2:55:39] <%castcode> Did anybody beat this yet
[2:55:39] <%skizzuto> Wisp is good
[2:55:40] <ScrapSentinel> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:55:40] <Karhax> will of the wisp is possibly the best item
[2:55:44] <ScatterCatt> Your damage is fine. Just gotta get enough money to get everything in the level and then activate the teleporter.
[2:55:46] <+gogozeppli> wont need damge if you kill the boss fast
[2:55:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Anyone here knows battle bear?
[2:55:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sileo_patronus I think 15 % each
[2:55:51] <+Estuko> PogChamp Killer Queen
[2:55:54] <+Nexoosen> @sileo_patronus it says 12%, but people are reporting its more like 8
[2:55:56] <CptBritches> At least the music is nice, right Pat? :)
[2:55:58] <NeroInfinite> sqeak
[2:56:04] <+gogozeppli> its dumb to ttry to buy everything in the level
[2:56:04] <+smevvster> Pat is experiencing the Probability of Percipitation

[2:56:11] <%Niney_Who> You do more damage if you don't die
[2:56:14] <+gogozeppli> the boss gives alot it would be wasted money

[2:56:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @smevvster Pat is almost wet
[2:56:26] <giga_bit> @AngriestPat Protip: the move on left trigger resets your gun recoil, so you can shoot farther for longer.
[2:56:26] <HeroOfTheWaste> He kinda needs to dodge roll more
[2:56:34] <ScrapSentinel> Rose Buckler LUL
[2:56:35] <rosemon5001> there should be an option to swtich off the corpses of enemys wich would help not getting confused whti the lemurians being the same as the chests

[2:57:12] <42nfl19> So did this game just come out of nowhere? I saw no news or promotion for it. Like one day, here you go!
[2:57:12] <+Nexoosen> @rosemon5001 there's different settings for corpses in the options, not sure if exactly what you're after is in there though

[3:02:26] <sukiyakiwestern> there isnt a max
[3:02:29] <Mnightshyamallama> I really don't know how I feel about this game being in 3D
[3:02:30] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> bears stack diminishingly

[3:03:02] <sukiyakiwestern> @doc_ock_rokc there is objectively no cap for bears
[3:03:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those super tall trees looks cool
[3:03:08] <MacMog> huh, evil flying staple pullers
[3:03:09] <%Ninestempest> wait what is the max for crit glasses, chat?
[3:03:27] <giga_bit> @Ninestempest I think it caps out at... 11? Maybe?
[3:03:32] <sileo_patronus> Pat can never escape the scourge of jellyfish
[3:03:34] <jagaloaf> WORTH
[3:03:44] <Mnightshyamallama> nice

[3:03:49] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> glasses cap at 10
[3:03:50] <%Ninestempest> I had 10 and was 90% sure i had 100% crit but i might be wrong?
[3:03:50] <%brickwall35> spend money to make money baybay
[3:03:52] <%Mythicalbrit> @Ninestempest its 10 glasses each one gives 10% crit
[3:03:53] <%Ninestempest> okay 10 cool
[3:03:54] <%Hilleltaco> We big defense bois
[3:03:54] <sileo_patronus> This is a good run so far item-wise
[3:03:55] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> each glasses is 10%
[3:03:56] <+Qsmash_> defense run
[3:04:00] <+gogozeppli> you can have infinite of items but the returns arent worth
[3:04:07] <sukiyakiwestern> @doc_ock_rokc no theres not, its been tested. bears get diminishing returns after 4. youd need over 6000 for 99.99% chance
[3:04:08] <+ShakeNDake> missle launcher!
[3:04:09] <randomp141> @AngriestPat So have you come out of the closet to Paige about being a lesbian???

[3:04:20] <+ArtemisCroc> nice
[3:04:26] <reonome> good shit
[3:04:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 here's some tips I picked up pat. Movement items are your friend. Easy traversal lets you evade enemy attacks and reach chests easier. When you beat the boss, do a victory lap and open all the chests you can, and spend all your money on a luck shrine before you go. If you get frozen, your dodge removes the Ice. Play multiplayer. If there's another target, there's less shots hitting you.

[3:05:15] <zedravan> You have around a 37% chance to block
[3:05:16] <foreverN2dust> Max Bear stack reached

[3:06:00] <%BestTeaMaker> move fast
[3:06:00] <Fujiwara_92> meh
[3:06:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wish the music is more upbeat to make the combat more intense, considering you're always gonna be hunted
[3:06:02] <%skizzuto> it's good for scouting the level
[3:06:14] <sukiyakiwestern> NOOOOO WISP
[3:06:15] <+chemtrailsgaming> anything that gives movement speed is great
[3:06:20] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat out of combat means not attacking, you don't have to be away from enemies
[3:06:30] <%skizzuto> teleporter is nearby I think, I saw red sparks

[3:08:40] <CptBritches> That was good though
[3:08:40] <+RushUnplugged> GG
[3:08:40] <+JavaManJoJo> you can line of sight that big AOE or use i frame on certain characters
[3:08:41] <Karhax> big aoe is rough
[3:08:42] <+chemtrailsgaming> Better!
[3:08:42] <sevelodon> you have to be behind cover pat
[3:08:42] <jagaloaf> The cave kinda fucked you over
[3:08:42] <LtThunderbolt> tank build with bears
[3:08:43] <zeoshock> they actually do need to make it clear that attack is line of sight based
[3:08:44] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat see why we like Risk of Rain so much now?
[3:08:44] <%Typhaeon> That was intense
[3:08:45] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat that explosion's line-of-sight, walls stop it
[3:08:45] <%spiritofmojave> You almost had it, good run tho!
[3:08:46] <%Afterman_> thats the face of a man who has given up
[3:08:46] <%BioApple> ap rounds are a good unlock
[3:08:47] <%waifoong98> Pat is feeling apatBig Stress
[3:08:50] <+trashamn> Good run
[3:08:50] <CyberKN> 4 bears tho
[3:08:50] <reonome> his AOE is bullshit
[3:08:52] <BlacSoul> Good fucking shit Pat
[3:08:52] <lejeune> ADVANCEMENT

[3:08:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> 200% increase in length
[3:08:54] <lizard0tm> YOU DIDN'T WIN said the jelly fish
[3:08:55] <zedravan> You had around a 37% chance to block with the 4 bears
[3:08:57] <Quabadaba> He wasn't angry enough. Let him get to full power
[3:08:57] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat that's a big aoe it does in the like, last 1/3 or so of its life. have to line of sight or run VERY FAR AWAY
[3:08:58] <rosemon5001> nice now throw yourself back into the grinder
[3:09:00] <ActiveLink> at least you unlocked a good item
[3:09:01] <mr_slaide> Use your consumable items!!!!
[3:09:01] <dsauce999> Getting hit with with the judgement shock
[3:09:03] <Sethzpyre> the electric booger done ya in
[3:09:05] <ScrapSentinel> @thegreenbenis vagrant has a huge AOE attack that does like 200 dmg
[3:09:05] <CptBritches> It really doesn't take long to actually pick up see? Only a couple hours and you can reliably get a few zones in
[3:09:06] <+chemtrailsgaming> His AOE damage is insane
[3:09:07] <%spiritofmojave> That four bear strat was a keeper for sure
[3:09:07] <sukiyakiwestern> just dont be in line of sigjt its not that bad
[3:09:11] <+randomarsehole> Check your logbook periodically to see what items do
[3:09:12] <+theKingRamses> you can see how to unlock those sillhouettes in the main menu
[3:09:13] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat character/item unlock conditions are in the logbook if you're wondering
[3:09:13] <a_mad_dragon> beat the first level 4 more times
[3:09:13] <startstoprepeat> consider easier difficulty just to unlock some other chars.
[3:09:21] <giga_bit> The cave was blocking all of your rockets lol
[3:09:24] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Give the lower difficulty a try, for real
[3:09:26] <natebud> is there anywhere to check how to unlock characters or items?
[3:09:29] <lejeune> go to logbook for chars
[3:09:31] <BlacSoul> Enjoying it? @angriestpat
[3:09:37] <+BubbleyBloos> Become scum and edit your xml to unlock all the characters
[3:09:39] <CptBritches> Nah, it's all good fun
[3:09:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Stress level 99
[3:09:54] <Parapattern> I remember the constant time stressing me the fuck out when I played the first game
[3:09:56] <%brickwall35> UUUU
[3:09:57] <+SovietBear86> @AngriestPat you really should start in easy until you get use a bit more to the game
[3:09:57] <CptBritches> That's called depression
[3:09:58] <+gogozeppli> beat stage 1 5 times or beat stage 3 for a new character
[3:09:59] <reonome> thats fine
[3:09:59] <SchlongKongEduardo> fair
[3:10:01] <%BioApple> that's super fair, that's how I feel about any jrpg ever
[3:10:04] <%spiritofmojave> I understand that
[3:10:04] <+reddpop_> Called being an adult
[3:10:09] <$cureneckbeard> well I recommended FTL
[3:10:09] <FantasticHaz> RoR 1 and this game require a different mindset to play well
[3:10:09] <+JavaManJoJo> the best part about Risk of Rain is breaking it over your knee with some of the broken builds you get
[3:10:10] <%GoldeNOVA> Darkest Dugeon IS miserable
[3:10:13] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat i promise you will enjoy easy mode. It just lowers the numbers a bit. You can get big and strong and see the content so you know how to prep for it later.
[3:10:14] <Caidezes> This just looks bland to me.
[3:10:16] <+GTCknight> I know this feeling very well
[3:10:24] <+talentedcrayon> @AngriestPat o shit, didnt expect to see you playing this
[3:10:36] <Sitromxe> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[3:10:46] <%ThePuddingDead> god i cant wait for DD2
[3:10:47] <Luesagna00> is this borderlands no man sky?
[3:10:49] <+Mokkakahvi> wait until you unlock other characters the game open up a bit more
[3:10:55] <FantasticHaz> Consider doing co-op, that's a lot of fun
[3:10:57] <Twoiis> Will he be trying it multiplayer?
[3:11:01] <+reddpop_> Might be better as it moves through early access
[3:11:02] <zedravan> Armor-Piercing Rounds Deal an additional 20% damage (+10% per stack) to bosses.
[3:11:03] <cerberuscarmine> huntress booty
[3:11:03] <dsauce999> No Man's Borders?
[3:11:04] <+chemtrailsgaming> Yeah RoR doesnt give a fuck about you lol
[3:11:10] <+talentedcrayon> Small weenus is a slow and insidious killer
[3:11:12] <Sethzpyre> at least theres some skill involved, kind of like binding of isaac except in 3d, and the challenge comes from the random loot drops and mobs
[3:11:13] <+gogozeppli> @Caidezes its because he's using a basic character
[3:11:19] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat you always seem happy when you stream rpgs, you should stream more of those
[3:11:19] <7Zealot> Honestly, this looks like a great 3D adaptation of the original
[3:11:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The price of preparedness paid now in gold, later in blood
[3:11:52] <CptBritches> Pat, you haven't even seen what is possible with this game. When you get the items stacked in crazy ways you can do ridiculous shit and the Mercenary character is like putting Raiden in the game as a playable character
[3:11:53] <Saltmeisterr> the beetle queen seems way rougher than the golem
[3:11:55] <Caidezes> @gogozeppli Then the game doesn't make a good first impression and it needs to be addressed.
[3:12:11] <mr_slaide> Old man games!
[3:12:12] <RevolverKeonet> The for real question is when are the dancing stone golems gonna get in
[3:12:13] <%Laecerelius> Pat loves the number go up
[3:12:15] <%Ez3z> why not stream Temmie's new RPG
[3:12:16] <Monkeyweed21> why not stream Octopath?
[3:12:16] <%brickwall35> Pat has no style, he has no grace
[3:12:17] <Mrbaconator> OLD MAN
[3:12:19] <%Ninestempest> Merc is fun to play until you fight a fucking worm
[3:12:19] <%waifoong98> Pat is growing old Kappa
[3:12:20] <+gogozeppli> scout area for the most expensive chest and save for them. always a good item or green
[3:12:20] <CptBritches> That's just a sign that you are ready to die
[3:12:21] <fabo_joyful> Plat CK2 then.
[3:12:31] <mr_slaide> Temmie Chang is a treasure which must be protected.
[3:12:32] <%ElenaManetta> Pat Stares At Mahjong
[3:12:32] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat chess stream when?
[3:12:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Go back to VtmB, I'm positive you'll have a better time there
[3:12:39] <DavidSanChan> pat plays kartia part 86
[3:12:42] <+Mokkakahvi> @Saltmeisterr nah beetle quuen can be cheesed easily titan on the other hand will fuck you up on evry difficulty if his beam hits you
[3:12:43] <%waifoong98> @ElenaManetta more like Rage at
[3:12:43] <juxtest> omg theres a Risk of Rain 2?!
[3:12:43] <+valkuma> Crusaader Kings 2
[3:12:43] <Karhax> Crusader Kings 2
[3:12:46] <london_flexing> @reddpop_ I mean whether people acknowledge a game is good for a specific audience doesn't really matter. Adults can be pissy about a number of pity things.
[3:12:47] <NeroInfinite> Crusader Kings 2
[3:12:47] <natebud> once you figure it out, this game becomes pretty chill
[3:12:50] <mr_slaide> Omg, I hated Kartia.
[3:12:51] <sileo_patronus> Crusaderkings
[3:12:51] <CptBritches> Crusader Kings 2, the grand strategy game
[3:12:54] <dsauce999> Pat would crush and incest run in CK2
[3:12:54] <DocMadfox> Crusader Kings 2: The Medieval Murder Incest Simulator
[3:12:55] <Mrbaconator> Crusader Kings 2 = CK2
[3:12:57] <lejeune> crusaadeer KINGS 222
[3:12:57] <+SovietBear86> Pat does not have the patience to learn to play CK2 lol
[3:12:58] <thegreenbenis> Crusader kings 2. You can commit incest
[3:13:02] <+gogozeppli> @Caidezes that's because pat isnt seeing the good advice
[3:13:03] <DocMadfox> Aka the best Game of Thrones game ever
[3:13:05] <lejeune> he would be so maddd
[3:13:09] <ButterscotchSoda> ROR2 is the RE2MAKE of Risk of Rain. Plays different but keeps the same feeling of panic.
[3:13:10] <Karhax> "I want slow games" but not actually slow games though
[3:13:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah it doesn't seem like you're having fun dude.
[3:13:11] <%Hammerknife> CK2 was before pats time i think?
[3:13:12] <%spiritofmojave> Crusader Kings 2 is a lot of menus, he might not like it
[3:13:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> Incest game
[3:13:13] <+RushUnplugged> Pat starest at Stellaris, that's the dream there
[3:13:13] <+Estuko> @thegreenbenis huh
[3:13:13] <hntronium> Eugenics the Game
[3:13:16] <%Hammerknife> that game is super super old
[3:13:16] <alrobot2014> ck 2 is too old man of an old man game
[3:13:18] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat Out of curiosity, do you like Strategy Games/City Builders?
[3:13:18] <CptBritches> But don't you want to have virtual incest?!
[3:13:22] <%mercado94> @Kirby_Sauce wat
[3:13:27] <Dr_Mooose> I could see you liking it
[3:13:30] <Sethzpyre> "Do" a lot shit indeed
[3:13:31] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Enemy step?
[3:13:31] <BlacSoul> ENEMY STEP
[3:13:34] <rosemon5001> you tryin to enemy step here boy?
[3:13:37] <thegreenbenis> Ck2 is the best war/incest game.
[3:13:38] <%Mekhet09> We're never going to get the drowne will we.
[3:13:41] <DocMadfox> I like CK2 and I'm younger than you....
[3:13:41] <%Hammerknife> civ isn't a city builder
[3:13:42] <mr_slaide> Play the new Civ 6 with Canada.
[3:13:44] <RoboXGP> Why isn't pat dressed up like a space man while playing this game?
[3:13:46] <NeroInfinite> There's always SimCity esq games.
[3:13:50] <fabo_joyful> What about City Skylines?
[3:13:51] <CptBritches> Civ is really not a city builder
[3:13:54] <Mnightshyamallama> LEECH SEED!!!
[3:13:56] <cerberuscarmine> this is a good start
[3:13:56] <+talentedcrayon> red whip is one of the most ball sack drops in this game
[3:14:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> @mercado94 the fan made goal of the game is to incest as hard as possible.
[3:14:03] <DocMadfox> Civ's not a city builder but I asked about strategy games too
[3:14:03] <SchlongKongEduardo> endless legend is good if you like civ
[3:14:04] <thegreenbenis> You aren't playing it right if you aren't married to your sister/daughter.
[3:14:05] <%Laecerelius> Sweet, sweet life leech!
[3:14:14] <dsauce999> Play city skylines and just nuke your creations with meteors
[3:14:14] <+MisoPhat_> speaking of rpg, would you be a yakuza if you lived in yakuza
[3:14:15] <%Hammerknife> i couldn't play endless legend after i finished the first game
[3:14:16] <Quabadaba> i always thought red whip was a nice qol drop
[3:14:18] <Ner234> Leech Seed is honestly a fucking life saver in this game
[3:14:20] <DocMadfox> Tropico 6 just came out and it's pretty good.
[3:14:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> @thegreenbenis this guy
[3:14:31] <mr_slaide> DO IT, NERD!
[3:14:32] <NeroInfinite> As long as you don't head into Elite: dangerous territory you won't posion your stream content
[3:14:35] <%Laecerelius> Life leech is always good
[3:14:35] <+Nexoosen> harvesters scythe is best item fight me
[3:14:37] <+trashamn> watching pat get better and better each run is great
[3:14:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder how Pat feels about Endless Space 2
[3:14:40] <%waifoong98> "Pat stares at RTS" and everything goes horribly wrong Kappa
[3:14:42] <natebud> I might pick this game up, looks pretty good
[3:14:43] <%Laecerelius> nothing like turning your offense into defense
[3:14:44] <RoboXGP> I saw a couple in pakistan like that, it was like why? after the 4th came out mentally disabled
[3:14:45] <%PaladinDupre> @angriestpat you do realize that a big part of why the Pillars streams got lower views is because your audience has grown a lot since then, right?
[3:15:00] <thegreenbenis> @Kirby_Sauce Do you even Zoroastrian?
[3:15:02] <%Hammerknife> tbh a lot of 4X games get by on the learning curve behind the mechanics and figuring out what matters
[3:15:02] <+valkuma> endless space is quite boring honestly.
[3:15:05] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Rimworld?
[3:15:07] <CptBritches> The art in Endless Space 2 is some of the best shit I
[3:15:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> The space terraria?
[3:15:10] <%schlager087> OSRS?
[3:15:13] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat Endless Space 2 is unexpectedly easier to wrap your head around than Civ
[3:15:14] <%Hammerknife> and then once you figure it out you break the game and it becomes trivially easy to stomp the AI
[3:15:17] <SchlongKongEduardo> nice
[3:15:19] <%Laecerelius> Yeah Pat streamed PoE like when he first started out, right?
[3:15:22] <FantasticHaz> HUGE
[3:15:22] <CptBritches> Wooooooow
[3:15:23] <lejeune> NIGHTMARE
[3:15:25] <%Ninestempest> lol this damage
[3:15:26] <Ner234> That damage buff is real
[3:15:29] <%Ninestempest> armor piercing rounds!
[3:15:36] <+gogozeppli> @natebud you missed the bogo free sale the had. best game with a friend
[3:15:38] <reonome> LUL
[3:15:39] <%ThePuddingDead> yep
[3:15:40] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[3:15:40] <%spiritofmojave> that was a really good first item drop
[3:15:40] <DocMadfox> Paladin's right about that, I wasn't watching his streams when he posted those or I would've watched them
[3:15:41] <+Haarute> I mean don't THROW YOURSELF into the enemy either.
[3:15:41] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[3:15:41] <Luesagna00> is this hollow boarders no mans?
[3:15:43] <%arancet> tried Oxygen Not Included from Klei?
[3:15:43] <%Ninestempest> tfw pat won't kill ads
[3:15:43] <cerberuscarmine> NOOOOO
[3:15:49] <NeroInfinite> nightmarenightmarenightmare
[3:15:49] <mr_slaide> We demand EMLO!
[3:15:52] <%brickwall35> Pat you're a big strong man and we love you
[3:15:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The amount of depth and technical stuff in that kind of game bamboozles me too
[3:15:55] <RevolverKeonet> i mean you caught all that bug acid point blank
[3:15:55] <lejeune> ads/dint/exist
[3:15:56] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@aiyobro) (warning)
[3:15:56] <dsauce999> WOoow *GETS FUKTED*
[3:15:57] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat SERIOUSLY try Drizzle
[3:15:58] <CptBritches> Yeah the ammo rounds make you do 30% more damage to bosses on the first one and 20% more on each stack
[3:15:59] <FantasticHaz> Consider easy mode
[3:15:59] <RevolverKeonet> multiple projectiles man
[3:16:01] <reonome> AP rounds are good shit
[3:16:02] <cerberuscarmine> try playing it on easy
[3:16:08] <+gogozeppli> never kill adss
[3:16:10] <cerberuscarmine> so you get things figured out
[3:16:10] <foreverN2dust> what do you have to do to unlock other characters?
[3:16:11] <reonome> its a balance
[3:16:11] <FantasticHaz> Easy mode is actually normal mode
[3:16:13] <DocMadfox> The adds are dancing
[3:16:13] <+gogozeppli> just boss rush
[3:16:14] <%Niney_Who> Kill ads when they're killing you harder than the boss
[3:16:16] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah its...too much
[3:16:17] <+gogozeppli> they are ads
[3:16:18] <cerberuscarmine> then hop into normal
[3:16:19] <Sethzpyre> the enemies dont even knw what to do with themselves
[3:16:20] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Just get good. ladleSmug ladleSmug
[3:16:23] <%spiritofmojave> I like these cute lizard adds, I will say
[3:16:23] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat kill the adds *if* you get a benefit from killing the adds, i.e. lifesteal on kill or chain damage onto boss
[3:16:24] <%waifoong98> Just kill everything Kappa
[3:16:24] <%Niney_Who> Also Killing Ads = health sometimes
[3:16:25] <%BioApple> Adds kind of come in waves, just focus on whatever's the bigger problem at the moment @AngriestPat
[3:16:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> Killing ads takes priority
[3:16:25] <natebud> @AngriestPat ads do stop eventually in the first game. after you activate the teleporter
[3:16:29] <lloyddboy> they stop once tele reaches 100%
[3:16:30] <lejeune> git gud
[3:16:31] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat Adds to stop. they don't spawn at the same rate you kill them, adn they stop spawning when the teleporter finishes. The boss won't get stronger, so you can take your time.
[3:16:31] <FirewallStorm> this entire game is a balance
[3:16:33] <Karhax> they do stop, once it hits 99% on the teleporter it stops spawning
[3:16:33] <SulfurousAcid> shovSip
[3:16:35] <rosemon5001> think of it as a run and gun and find the portal all in one @AngriestPat
[3:16:36] <CptBritches> You really get used to it
[3:16:37] <reonome> yes
[3:16:37] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat I kill ADS until I have pretty much everything on the map and then focus on killing the boss when it shows up
[3:16:38] <RoboXGP> When the ads line up shoot them all at once
[3:16:43] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat This game's difficulties are like God Hand, easy is normal, pretty much
[3:16:43] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat If you're dying to a boss and run away from the boss, you can kill Adds for HP if you have the right items
[3:16:43] <+Nexoosen> You tend to try to kite in circles, try moving around the edge of the arena to get distance from ads
[3:16:44] <sukiyakiwestern> pat would cum over huntress glaive i swear
[3:16:45] <+Haarute> @AngriestPat Focus on staying alive rather than dealing damage.
[3:16:45] <+Mokkakahvi> commando is pretty shit at killing adds other characters do it way more easily
[3:16:46] <+Kilik_> getting the teleporter to 99% stops them from spawning
[3:16:49] <%Laecerelius> The thing I saw was that her acid spit did fucktons of damage
[3:16:49] <%ThePuddingDead> you mean stop spawning? it looks that way i could be wrong
[3:16:49] <natebud> boss was always the last thing I killed in the first game @AngriestPat
[3:16:51] <SunsetJack> Teleporter events ay 100% stop spawning stuff
[3:16:52] <+acenugget> The flying masks suck if you get too many on you early. they will just chip away at your health till you are dead
[3:16:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> If you wre playing wwith PEOPLE then you can take turns focusing on ads and shit
[3:16:55] <giga_bit> Usually you want to kill all Wisp adds first, then focus the boss.
[3:16:57] <FirewallStorm> the thing you have to do is find that balance
[3:16:57] <%PaladinDupre> the only way to make them stop is to turn off the game
[3:16:59] <%Laecerelius> like two of those killed him
[3:17:01] <DocMadfox> Try Multiplayer and get carried.
[3:17:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> Some items deal damage to other enemies on kill. So killing ads CAN HURT the boss
[3:17:01] <+gogozeppli> pat i have 2 hour long runs in this game dont kill ads
[3:17:07] <+Mokkakahvi> easy is the normal mode of this game
[3:17:09] <%brickwall35> so you stop asking us questions and learn yourself
[3:17:10] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat adds stop when the tele reaches 99%
[3:17:11] <%BioApple> so you can get unlocks faster
[3:17:12] <cerberuscarmine> EASY PLAY IT
[3:17:12] <Mr_Strut> Because you need it.
[3:17:12] <%waifoong98> so that you can get further
[3:17:13] <%spiritofmojave> Probably to unlock stuff, I'd bet
[3:17:14] <%Ninestempest> @gogozeppli so do I and I kill adds? lol
[3:17:14] <sevelodon> difficulty ramps up slower
[3:17:15] <TheLeadingTone> Difficulty scales up as you go\
[3:17:16] <+NiktenKing> Because you are new
[3:17:16] <cerberuscarmine> YOU GET MORE STUFF
[3:17:18] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Drizzle just makes the Difficulty meter go slower
[3:17:20] <StaticSunrise> because the game teaches you nothing
[3:17:20] <+trashamn> unlock characteres easier
[3:17:21] <FantasticHaz> Normal mode is actually hard as fuck if you don't know what to do
[3:17:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Easy is the normal of this game? Really?
[3:17:22] <+Haarute> On easy you can get further and therefore unlock more items and characters.
[3:17:23] <%Niney_Who> And gives more items
[3:17:23] <%velemi> because you will have a better time
[3:17:24] <aimlesshealer> I don't think Easy = shameful in this game
[3:17:27] <ingofgc> the difficulty increases over time, so easy will become normal
[3:17:27] <$cureneckbeard> easy mode is easier
[3:17:28] <NeroInfinite> You get more shit.
[3:17:29] <%Spydurman> Unlock Characters and Items faster
[3:17:31] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Pat
[3:17:31] <yourliteraldog> whats this ps2 game
[3:17:32] <Captain_Joe1911> Paaat picnicMon
[3:17:32] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> easy is for commando @AngriestPat
[3:17:33] <cerberuscarmine> its good practice
[3:17:34] <FirewallStorm> your new
[3:17:34] <+oldsmandrinker> you're not good enough to play on hard yet. it's super hard
[3:17:37] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat It's not "easy" it's "easier"
[3:17:37] <FantasticHaz> Like RoR1 is the same way, it's a WEIRD GAME if you don't know what the goal is
[3:17:37] <Monkeyweed21> easy in RoR is easy on godhand
[3:17:38] <ingofgc> starting on normal means it starts sliding towards hard
[3:17:39] <RevolverKeonet> You need to beat three levels to unlock a character, and change would be nice. Easy makes it easier doing just that
[3:17:39] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Pat, just get gud. ladleSmug
[3:17:39] <lejeune> ror2
[3:17:40] <+Nexoosen> @gogozeppli I kill adds and have had a 3 hour run, that doesnt mean anything lol
[3:17:42] <reonome> @AngriestPat all easy does is slow down the difficulty timer, so its easier for you to understand the game
[3:17:44] <+NiktenKing> the difficulty gauge is slower, but it's still the same difficulty in the long run
[3:17:44] <DracaenaLeaf> It's like playing easy on God Hand
[3:17:45] <Davion_Salkovich> it's to LEARN THE GAME
[3:17:46] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> because you keep dying?????
[3:17:47] <%waifoong98> Just do it in 2hou mentality LUL , easy is starter mode
[3:17:47] <%ThePuddingDead> no buts, give it a try
[3:17:47] <Mr_Strut> Easy = Normal. Normal = Hard. Hard = Pat Must Die.
[3:17:48] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat easy mode is now selectable"" dont let them insult you like dat >.<
[3:17:48] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Easy is good practice
[3:17:48] <ButterscotchSoda> gets just as hard, just gets there slower
[3:17:49] <alrobot2014> is it like FTL level easy?
[3:17:50] <%BioApple> I loved that with the right artifacts Monsoon was actually easier on RoR1
[3:17:50] <+Flambage> Play it on Dante must Die!
[3:17:51] <Davion_Salkovich> SO YOU CAN PLAY IT RIGHT
[3:17:51] <+Fyre_link> easy mode is normal mode. Normal mode is hard. Hard mdoe is fuck you mdoe in this game
[3:17:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> Here come the gobolins...
[3:17:55] <Sunditsu> He's asking what the difference is chat
[3:17:59] <SulfurousAcid> it's like playing on devil hunter before son of sparda
[3:18:01] <CptBritches> Easy mode makes unlocking other classes quicker, but it's really not a big deal. Commando is fine to learn on
[3:18:02] <%Spydurman> play whatever difficulty you want man chat is being weird
[3:18:03] <Yeajow> Your problem is pacing this'll help you acclamate
[3:18:04] <cerberuscarmine> its how you learn so when you hop into the harder modes its all muscle memory
[3:18:05] <%Rngiddion> gotta lab before you go only brah
[3:18:05] <Monkeyweed21> diffuclty here is similar to godhand
[3:18:06] <%Niney_Who> Easy = Normal, Normal = Hard, Hard = Impossible challenge
[3:18:07] <+Nexoosen> The only difference is that difficulty scales slower
[3:18:07] <TheLeadingTone> If you play on easy and unlock stuff they carry over into harder difficulties
[3:18:08] <DocMadfox> Pat we don't think you have a smaller dick for playing it on easy
[3:18:11] <Maleicus> did pat freeze
[3:18:12] <+gogozeppli> you must play fast killing ads just waste time and make boses harder
[3:18:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Easy is for when you start in terms of progression? And get better and get more stuff then go up to normal difficulty?
[3:18:13] <sukiyakiwestern> drizzle is slower AND you have built in armor hopoo confirmed
[3:18:16] <%spiritofmojave> Easy mode is now acceptable!
[3:18:17] <BoBoCatBurger> Difficulties affect the timer thats all
[3:18:18] <%Niney_Who> It is NOT like human
[3:18:18] <SchlongKongEduardo> its because youre old Kappa
[3:18:19] <Arrior_Septem> Just try it?
[3:18:19] <DavidSanChan> use faust
[3:18:20] <natebud> You don't really have to play easy. The game is hard, that's it
[3:18:23] <cerberuscarmine> pat no
[3:18:24] <Sethzpyre> @AngriestPat play whatever man
[3:18:25] <%Kirijuo> The only difference easy mode makes is it gives you more time
[3:18:26] <sukiyakiwestern> so you do survive longer
[3:18:27] <reonome> no pat
[3:18:27] <%SovietBear86> No Pat
[3:18:28] <%velemi> No it isn't pat
[3:18:28] <dsauce999> BUY ENEMY STEP
[3:18:29] <FirewallStorm> its not humen
[3:18:29] <+gogozeppli> if i clear 4 bosses on easy and take the 4 green items why farm?
[3:18:31] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat RoR Drizzle is NOT human
[3:18:32] <startstoprepeat> all easy does is slow down the difficulty progression
[3:18:33] <%velemi> you'
[3:18:34] <CptBritches> Pat you haven't played in on easy you literally don't know
[3:18:34] <StaticSunrise> it gives you breathing room to learn on your own because they game does not teach you ANYTHING
[3:18:37] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[3:18:39] <foreverN2dust> Won't hurt to try
[3:18:39] <cerberuscarmine> YAY
[3:18:39] <%BigNerdSam> There's no shame in playing Easy Mode...
[3:18:39] <Caidezes> Pat being a tryhard.
[3:18:39] <Gameslayer2> They say easy is like normal
[3:18:40] <reonome> all easy does is slow it down
[3:18:42] <giga_bit> just play whatever difficulty, the game is a learning experience
[3:18:42] <lloyddboy> HUZZAH
[3:18:42] <%brickwall35> GOBLINS DEFEATED ahhh
[3:18:44] <FantasticHaz> It'll help you get a feel for it, also you will unlock some more characters to play around with
[3:18:45] <%Niney_Who> Now if Pat does good the Brain Goblins will make him play a harder difficulty mode immediately
[3:18:46] <Monkeyweed21> easy starts easy, gets hard. normal starts harder, gets WAY harder
[3:18:46] <+JavaManJoJo> !uptime
[3:18:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 18m.
[3:18:47] <BoBoCatBurger> Playing easy gives you more time before shit hits the fan that’s all
[3:18:48] <%BigNerdSam> ... Unless youre a touhou
[3:18:50] <%waifoong98> Doesn't hurt learning first ya know LUL
[3:18:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat drizzle basically eases up on the amount of elits and wont slap you wwwith a milliion ads in the first boss fight
[3:18:53] <%BioApple> doesn't drizzle make the teleporter go faster too? It did in 1
[3:18:55] <sileo_patronus> Except Rainstorm is far more difficult than Devil Hunter
[3:18:55] <cerberuscarmine> breaking pat out of his confort zone
[3:18:56] <+Nexoosen> we might see a new character and get rid of lame ass commando Pog
[3:18:56] <%GoldeNOVA> Finally!
[3:18:57] <chadmongo> @AngriestPat Its like starting Godhand on normal
[3:19:00] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Wow it really is slowed down
[3:19:06] <Sethzpyre> less enemies to deal with maybe?
[3:19:07] <%Niney_Who> But it'.. it's not the same
[3:19:14] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat its also because you refuse to play multiplayer
[3:19:15] <%ThePuddingDead> did u do the same thing with Godhand pat? @AngriestPat
[3:19:20] <%ThePuddingDead> and how did that work out?
[3:19:22] <%GwatchaSquatcha> Wow they completely changed the look of the game didn’t they?
[3:19:23] <PhantaniumOG> I honestly think playing this on controller is crazy hard cause of how precise you have to be on commando
[3:19:24] <nootsandbooter> I think you get money a bit quicker on easy as well
[3:19:25] <Yeajow> Single player is already harder and youre new to it
[3:19:26] <Davion_Salkovich> it's not the same you're just a big ego idiot
[3:19:27] <%velemi> It won't ramp up as fast and overwhelm you as much
[3:19:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> But you shouldn't tho right?
[3:19:33] <SchlongKongEduardo> LUL
[3:19:34] <FirewallStorm> how did that work out?
[3:19:34] <Sethzpyre> Trial by fire
[3:19:38] <chadmongo> @AngriestPat Yeah but it changes the difficutly in similar ways
[3:19:39] <FirewallStorm> how long tho
[3:19:40] <%spiritofmojave> Starting God Hand on Normal, who do you think you are, Alexander?
[3:19:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> And did you enjoy that?
[3:19:43] <lejeune> patt
[3:19:46] <CptBritches> Would you rather play on easy or would you rather get so frustrated that you drop the game?
[3:19:49] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat There's a reason why they don't call them "Easy/Medium/Hard", the game gets tougher as time goes on, look at the top right.
[3:19:51] <Mr_Strut> And how old were you when you beat it?
[3:19:54] <%Spydurman> Guys let em play on normal, it's no biggie
[3:19:57] <reonome> nice job chat
[3:20:00] <+Mokkakahvi> playing on easy in the beginning is adviced you dont have the unlocks to be good in the beginning
[3:20:01] <dsauce999> Jeez, chat a bit...strong tonight.
[3:20:01] <%spiritofmojave> it is
[3:20:01] <FantasticHaz> The real juice of the game is getting to the mid-end game where your character is really broken, easy will let you get a taste of that JUICE if you're dying on normal a lot
[3:20:02] <natebud> normal is the way to go.
[3:20:02] <%brickwall35> dude all of Pat's GOBLINS revolve around Pat's subconscious pride around not playing "easy"
[3:20:04] <%nmaten> back when you were good at video games
[3:20:06] <FirewallStorm> HOW LONG THO?
[3:20:10] <%Spydurman> This is Pat, he gets good and beats it after 50 tries
[3:20:12] <Caidezes> Pat likes to wave his giant e-peen around, guys. He doesn't like easy modes.
[3:20:15] <squirtkitten> Is there still the rune in this that lets you choose what you get from each chest?
[3:20:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> "Starting" as in FIRST TIME ever
[3:20:22] <+NiktenKing> @AngriestPat It's like playing Afterbirth+ when people should have played Rebirth to learn the game.
[3:20:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @dsauce999 look there's been a lot of tension bewtween chat and Pat's goblins recently ok?
[3:20:25] <Karhax> That was before you became an ancient old man
[3:20:29] <+Abdul1295> this music is eerie. I don't like it
[3:20:35] <%skizzuto> @squirtkitten not currently
[3:20:35] <squirtkitten> I remember it in the first game and it maks the game a thousand times easier to work with since yo ucan max the right items for each character
[3:20:40] <%waifoong98> LUL
[3:20:42] <RevolverKeonet> @AngriestPat cool tip you might not know, phase bullets work through walls too
[3:20:42] <CptBritches> Yeah, but you are much more adept to that type of game, whereas you aren't here
[3:20:42] <+Abdul1295> reminds me of a 80s movie
[3:20:44] <%ThePuddingDead> yes
[3:20:45] <Ion_Laser> aw man
[3:20:45] <%spiritofmojave> jermaPluto
[3:20:46] <squirtkitten> @skizzuto ah boo
[3:20:46] <+Mokkakahvi> @squirtkitten no artifacts are not yet implemented
[3:20:49] <+trashamn> if u beat 2 more teleporters u get a character
[3:20:49] <%velemi> LUL
[3:20:51] <Dr_Mooose> keep you humble
[3:20:52] <+gogozeppli> @squirtkitten no runes yets. miss the fun balls
[3:20:54] <Monkeyweed21> thats right jay
[3:20:58] <Mr_Strut> Because we're all getting older all the time and it sucks
[3:21:01] <natebud> I never played the first game's easy mode ever
[3:21:02] <squirtkitten> @Mokkakahvi @gogozeppli TY <3
[3:21:06] <DavidSanChan> still young at heart, oh wait, the redbulls..
[3:21:07] <Parapattern> Do it to them dirty in front of they dad
[3:21:07] <%brickwall35> @NiktenKing there really isn't much difference (I've 100%'d Rebirth, mostly through A+)
[3:21:11] <lejeune> age :(
[3:21:13] <%spiritofmojave> People are also getting old and projecting their pain into messing with you
[3:21:14] <dsauce999> @Youwereeatenbyalid True
[3:21:35] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @dsauce999 It's like an episode of star trek where the cast tries to teach data how to be more human
[3:21:36] <Mr_Strut> Remember all the dreams you had and all the the things you hoped to be?
[3:21:40] <FantasticHaz> No
[3:21:41] <+aidan_starmanjr> it's so weird seeing characters that were like 6 pixels high rendered in fully detailed 3D
[3:21:43] <%velemi> no
[3:21:44] <%Tucker0603> no
[3:21:44] <%Niney_Who> That'd make no sense
[3:21:45] <SunsetJack> No
[3:21:46] <%skizzuto> no
[3:21:48] <+Nexoosen> no ipact on spawns
[3:21:49] <Sethzpyre> Easy mode= less enemies to deal, less chests are needed
[3:21:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Mr_Strut absolutely not
[3:21:51] <+smevvster> No, but single player makes less chests
[3:21:51] <%GoldeNOVA> No, it's just bad luck
[3:21:54] <%ThePuddingDead> nope ur blind
[3:22:07] <giga_bit> Chest number depends on number of players
[3:22:08] <rosemon5001> rng jesus isnt just very kind to you
[3:22:10] <%skizzuto> you just got a lot of turrets this run
[3:22:10] <FantasticHaz> HOPOO FEATHER
[3:22:11] <chocobodundee> I missed the necrodancer segment, how did that go?
[3:22:11] <+DrPoxx> Easy mode slows down the difficulty timer progression
[3:22:11] <squirtkitten> @aidan_starmanjr its weird seeing all the items on your model
[3:22:17] <FantasticHaz> DOUBLE JUMP BOIS
[3:22:20] <aimlesshealer> You guys I literally cannot stop eating chocolate covered almonds
[3:22:21] <%ThePuddingDead> too bad
[3:22:22] <Karhax> hopoo feather is basically extra survivability
[3:22:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Ninestempest)
[3:22:24] <Mr_Strut> YES YOU DO
[3:22:25] <%GoldeNOVA> YOU DO
[3:22:25] <%castcode> NO JUMPS
[3:22:26] <giga_bit> Trust me, you want extra jumps.
[3:22:26] <FantasticHaz> No Pat double jump is the best item
[3:22:27] <ScrapSentinel> extra jumps are important
[3:22:28] <%Kirijuo> @AngriestPat I think you're over thinking the difficulties, Drizzle is not easy, the timer in the game determines difficulty, the 3 game modes affect the rate the timer builds
[3:22:30] <%velemi> double jump to avoid attacks
[3:22:31] <Fujiwara_92> MORE JUMPS
[3:22:32] <Jackalope322> A I R H I K E
[3:22:32] <+JavaManJoJo> you NEED to be jumping later on
[3:22:32] <%skizzuto> spamming jump is literally how you dodge shit
[3:22:34] <lloyddboy> TABLE HOPPER
[3:22:35] <+theKingRamses> that extra jump is good for juking that boss that spits at you
[3:22:38] <FantasticHaz> Jumps = harder to hit = YOU DIE LESS
[3:22:41] <+Nexoosen> Double jump is graet, if he can aim while using it
[3:22:43] <%Niney_Who> Pat jump to Dodge is important
[3:22:44] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat get those turrets. They will help you get more money in the long run
[3:22:45] <%waifoong98> Pat hates airhike Chat Kappa
[3:22:47] <Fujiwara_92> Extra jump is air hike PAT
[3:22:48] <lejeune> do you not remember DMC where jump=dodge
[3:22:49] <foreverN2dust> air hike
[3:22:50] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat The difficulty in the game is NOT the difficulty you select at the start. It's the meter at the top right, below the time elapsed
[3:22:51] <%Niney_Who> Many enemies are SUPER accurate unless you dodge
[3:22:57] <%Reizie_Etherealm> A bait of that quality is sure to reel in some good fishes
[3:22:58] <lejeune> AIR hike
[3:22:58] <RevolverKeonet> so many turrets, bad luck pat
[3:22:59] <FantasticHaz> Jumping is the dodge of this game
[3:23:04] <Buttku> pat rrreealllyyy isn't enjoying this game
[3:23:05] <aimlesshealer> the DICKiculty
[3:23:06] <dsauce999> DICKFULTY
[3:23:06] <%ThePuddingDead> the dick huh?
[3:23:07] <%Niney_Who> The DICK
[3:23:07] <Tetsu_TIW> THE DICK
[3:23:09] <%BioApple> the duck fullty
[3:23:10] <%spiritofmojave> ???
[3:23:11] <reonome> DICK
[3:23:13] <%Tucker0603> THE DICK
[3:23:14] <DocMadfox> Pat's been talking about dicks a lot
[3:23:15] <%Spydurman> dick-itulty
[3:23:15] <Ner234> ??? LUL
[3:23:18] <Sethzpyre> Dick full tea
[3:23:18] <Mr_Strut> The dick futility
[3:23:20] <%Niney_Who> There's also 3 Tiers to each difficulty that ramp up
[3:23:25] <%BigNerdSam> DlCK-FULL-TEE
[3:23:25] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat Difficulty you select at the start slows the difficulty growth down, or speeds it up.
[3:23:27] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat easy buys you more time to get loot. that's it
[3:23:29] <%ThePuddingDead> i think you're overanalyzing being wrong
[3:23:29] <%spiritofmojave> Dick is futile
[3:23:29] <Foymic> your mumbling
[3:23:37] <%velemi> it ramps up slower but still reaches the same end point
[3:23:43] <+Nexoosen> it means if you#'re slow as shit, and you're on easy, you're having the standard experiance of most players
[3:23:51] <%maybefalco> the timed difficulty ultimately becomes the same regardless of the chosen difficulty
[3:23:55] <+Nexoosen> on normal
[3:23:58] <CptBritches> The easy mode only slows down the rate that it gets harder. It will still end up getting just as hard eventually
[3:23:59] <giga_bit> Drizzle mode actually does give you less enemies and more cash to work with, but the scaling is the same, just slower.
[3:24:00] <Sitromxe> @ThePuddingDead He sure is.
[3:24:10] <+JavaManJoJo> tough times saved you so much last run
[3:24:10] <+DrPoxx> It gives you a greater chance to outpace enemy stat increases and become god
[3:24:11] <Fujiwara_92> except bear
[3:24:11] <ScrapSentinel> only a few are really worth getting
[3:24:11] <Sethzpyre> you literally scoffed at that shield
[3:24:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> It's a head start, it still will go to normal->hard->etc
[3:24:12] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah pat?
[3:24:13] <CptBritches> And it also seems that you keep dying. Hmmmmmmmmmmm
[3:24:15] <%skizzuto> but the teddy bears carried you that run
[3:24:15] <reonome> dude your teddy bear saved your ass last run
[3:24:16] <aimlesshealer> Sounds like BoI mentality LUL
[3:24:16] <+Flambage> Use Royal Guard more!
[3:24:16] <DocMadfox> @AngriestPat I think you're just judging yourself too harshly for playing on what you perceive as a lower difficulty.
[3:24:18] <SulfurousAcid> pat just want attack go up
[3:24:18] <cerberuscarmine> get drones
[3:24:23] <kuningaz45> NotLikeThis
[3:24:23] <DemonicCipher> yeah trust us pat that defensive itmes are arguably better than offensive
[3:24:23] <Monkeyweed21> why is Pat obsessed with DPS when he plays a Tank in MMOs?
[3:24:24] <ScrapSentinel> rose shield is fucking awful
[3:24:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat doesn't want to survive then
[3:24:24] <%GoldeNOVA> Remember how bear saved your ass?
[3:24:25] <TyrantSlime> If you kill fast enough you can't die
[3:24:27] <%Spydurman> Are you enjoying the game? Feels kinda like Subnautica where you're struggling a bit but might enjoy it
[3:24:29] <%spiritofmojave> those bears were pretty good at damage mitigation tho, don't you think?
[3:24:29] <natebud> Drones are worth it if you find one
[3:24:31] <Parapattern> Pat want # big
[3:24:33] <Fujiwara_92> Use Royal Guard Pat
[3:24:33] <CptBritches> The farthest you got was when you stacked multiple bears which is a defensive item
[3:24:35] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat where has paige been?
[3:24:35] <Karhax> drones pretty good early game
[3:24:35] <+Sorro96> The game music is also a bit loud
[3:24:39] <lejeune> its not a big deal pat
[3:24:42] <%Mikatonic> but if you don't dodge properly, then you need defense
[3:24:42] <%ThePuddingDead> music's fine for me
[3:24:49] <%brickwall35> guys, the BOIA+ stream is gonna be rough, isn't it?
[3:24:51] <rosemon5001> teleporter was in the water pit again if you want
[3:24:54] <BlacSoul> Pat “DPS Race” Boivin
[3:24:57] <%spiritofmojave> makes sense for more hectic normal, yeah
[3:24:58] <NeroInfinite> Not dieing means you get tos hoot longer.
[3:25:00] <%brickwall35> I'm so hyped for it lol
[3:25:00] <dsauce999> PAT, why don't you use the shurikens Kappa
[3:25:01] <+Mokkakahvi> @AngriestPat kill the flying heads they do alot of damage if you let them spawn too much
[3:25:02] <squirtkitten> Is the barbed wire and electric equivalent still in?
[3:25:03] <%waifoong98> I bet Pat headbashed those bandit right near the start of the starting camp of Dragon's Dogma too Kappa
[3:25:03] <CptBritches> You might not have even gotten that far without them
[3:25:06] <%GoldeNOVA> Things get hectic, you WANT defense and mobility
[3:25:07] <sileo_patronus> But then you would have died to the first boss
[3:25:08] <natebud> What you want is a healing item, attack combo
[3:25:08] <FantasticHaz> This game is about taking whatever item you get and using it to your advantage, some might seem sucky but then they can come back and save your ass later if you utilize them
[3:25:09] <+DrPoxx> Do you need someone to join you? it is way funner with more people
[3:25:12] <kuningaz45> Pat barriers are important
[3:25:14] <%BioApple> I mean I'd like to disagree but in 1 I never ever took Glass off once I got it
[3:25:15] <Monkeyweed21> LEFT
[3:25:17] <SulfurousAcid> just buy everything
[3:25:18] <ScrapSentinel> YOU RAN PAST ONE
[3:25:18] <chocobodundee> just ran past one
[3:25:18] <+Nexoosen> just passed a usable item
[3:25:19] <IMCthulhu> missed a useable item
[3:25:19] <+trashamn> if pat likes dps i think he may like isaac more, although the bullshit is greater
[3:25:22] <%maybefalco> you passed one
[3:25:23] <lloyddboy> BLIND
[3:25:24] <RevolverKeonet> you outran an item usable chest
[3:25:28] <natebud> There was one you passed across the chasm
[3:25:30] <lejeune> lets just let pat play unless he MISSES a CHEST
[3:25:32] <Junkfist> I saw you miss like 3 chests
[3:25:46] <%skizzuto> passed an orange chest with an active item
[3:25:50] <+Nexoosen> left
[3:25:52] <Monkeyweed21> LEFT
[3:25:53] <%ThePuddingDead> god those flying types are annoying
[3:25:57] <+Haarute> Not here.
[3:25:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> We might as well name the rogue like week as goblin week since this is the type of game that the goblins take over
[3:25:58] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[3:25:58] <%skizzuto> too far
[3:26:00] <dsauce999> too far
[3:26:00] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis
[3:26:01] <%Tucker0603> left
[3:26:01] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat I mean, you do favor stabby, critty rogues, so nobody should be surprised that you want all of the DPS.
[3:26:01] <Monkeyweed21> BEHID
[3:26:02] <%skizzuto> turn around
[3:26:02] <+theKingRamses> it's next to one of those half-submerged rings in the ground
[3:26:02] <%maybefalco> the orange chest
[3:26:05] <%waifoong98> LUL
[3:26:07] <%brickwall35> LUL
[3:26:08] <foreverN2dust> Orange
[3:26:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> Damage is level, ATK items are percentile increases in crits or bonus effects, or effects on kill.
[3:26:14] <+Haarute> It's one of the orange ones.
[3:26:15] <buerdo> There was a chest behind pillar where you got sheild
[3:26:16] <Fujiwara_92> not there to the left of where you were
[3:26:20] <dsauce999> DO DA LOOP
[3:26:20] <RevolverKeonet> there's an orange canister diagonally left from turret
[3:26:23] <%skizzuto> by the arch on your left
[3:26:32] <kuningaz45> Pat, you want that turret
[3:26:40] <lloyddboy> phew
[3:26:44] <CptBritches> Lmao the wings
[3:26:45] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat you basically always want to be kiting enemies into giant groups so you can easily shoot them while running away
[3:26:52] <thegreenbenis> That's cool.
[3:26:52] <dsauce999> RUN BISH RUN
[3:26:55] <Onamar> Its near the teleporter
[3:26:55] <aimlesshealer> Fairy wings yey :D
[3:26:56] <Sethzpyre> Neato
[3:26:56] <%spiritofmojave> That seems rad
[3:26:57] <Monkeyweed21> turrets are free exp
[3:27:00] <+DrPoxx> DOnt get turret
[3:27:02] <squirtkitten> Does the suppressing fire still penetrate?
[3:27:04] <ButterscotchSoda> no turret
[3:27:07] <FantasticHaz> Turrets are good near the shrine
[3:27:08] <giga_bit> Don't bother getting the turret
[3:27:09] <Monkeyweed21> they kill anything that gets near
[3:27:10] <+DrPoxx> waste of money if you arent fighting there
[3:27:12] <CptBritches> Get the turret if you have the money to spend, but otherwise no
[3:27:12] <Fujiwara_92> no turret only drone
[3:27:12] <%maybefalco> drones are good, turrets are only good near teleporter
[3:27:13] <natebud> You get money and xp for what they kill
[3:27:13] <%Halowood> No not turrent, you awnt drones
[3:27:13] <FantasticHaz> But you don't need them
[3:27:13] <NeroInfinite> Don't get the turret
[3:27:14] <Karhax> nah, turrets are pretty bad unless its at a teleporter
[3:27:17] <%BioApple> @squirtkitten only the LT pierces
[3:27:18] <+reddpop_> Turret gets you passive income and cleans up adds
[3:27:19] <CptBritches> Or if the turret is in a good place
[3:27:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dsauce999) (warning)
[3:27:25] <+Nexoosen> honestly, he's bought out everything he's gonna buy, no point not to buy turrets in that case
[3:27:26] <Lamedhos> Make up your mind chat
[3:27:29] <Sethzpyre> Oh look the electric booger is back
[3:27:31] <+UnusualSalmon> you lose all your money at the end of the round so if you have nothing else to spend it on why not get a turret
[3:27:33] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat turret kills its price in enemies
[3:27:33] <SulfurousAcid> it's hiiim
[3:27:33] <reonome> chat being bipolar today
[3:27:34] <a_mad_dragon> "gentle"
[3:27:34] <Sitromxe> Heh. Pat's character has pixie wings.
[3:27:34] <CptBritches> Ain't no hiding this time. Prepare to get slapped
[3:27:36] <squirtkitten> @bioapple was that the one in the first that was like a big line shot or something? I havent played iti nlike two years
[3:27:36] <lejeune> vagrant back
[3:27:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fly! Fly like ace combat!
[3:27:39] <Fujiwara_92> MOBILITY
[3:27:40] <RevolverKeonet> find cover pat
[3:27:41] <NeroInfinite> Here's your best friend pat
[3:27:42] <+Haarute> Get space.
[3:27:43] <RevolverKeonet> he gon AOE
[3:27:45] <natebud> Pat hates double jump Kappa
[3:27:50] <sileo_patronus> If it's right next to the boss then turret's great, any other time it's fairly underwhelming
[3:27:52] <+NiktenKing> Fly
[3:27:54] <%Niney_Who> Lunar coin
[3:27:55] <CptBritches> LUNAR COIN
[3:27:58] <+DrPoxx> Money converts to XP though so instead of wasting on turret get bigger level number
[3:27:59] <%BioApple> @squirtkitten I think so? I never played him much in 1 but that sounds about right
[3:27:59] <kuningaz45> Kite them fuckers Pat
[3:28:01] <jacknerik> FLy You FOOL
[3:28:11] <%waifoong98> what is this, a musou game? Kappa
[3:28:14] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> LUNAR COIN
[3:28:16] <rosemon5001> cant wait to see what the 3d version of ifrit will look like
[3:28:17] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> GET IT
[3:28:17] <squirtkitten> @BioApple are the soldier syringes back? COmmando is busted with max syringes cuz you shoot hella fast
[3:28:27] <sukiyakiwestern> USE FLIGHR
[3:28:30] <Sitromxe> Back off before they surround you.
[3:28:36] <chocobodundee> syringes are in
[3:28:37] <%Laecerelius> Pat has a soldier syringe right now
[3:28:40] <RevolverKeonet> @squirtkitten they sure are
[3:28:43] <lejeune> wingsssss
[3:28:49] <sileo_patronus> That is entirely too many wisps
[3:28:50] <%waifoong98> LUL
[3:28:58] <sevelodon> yeah you're using a controller Kappa
[3:28:59] <+DrPoxx> yeah but you want like at least 5 syringes
[3:29:00] <squirtkitten> maybe itsb ecause of the controller for a shooty shoot game
[3:29:01] <CptBritches> You are just a bad
[3:29:02] <%BioApple> @squirtkitten they are! I haven't played this enough to know if they're as good bc I think item stacking was changed. tbf every character was busted with syringe stacks in 1
[3:29:05] <FantasticHaz> I would use KB+M for this game
[3:29:05] <+Haarute> HIDE
[3:29:09] <CptBritches> WATCH OUT
[3:29:10] <%Laecerelius> Yeah i'd imagine playing a shooter with a controller would suck
[3:29:10] <+sourceofall> this game looks kind of tedious
[3:29:13] <Fujiwara_92> YOU'RE DOING IT
[3:29:17] <Sitromxe> You almost got him.
[3:29:18] <+king_of_beggars> If only you had some kind of turret to speed this up.
[3:29:19] <RevolverKeonet> GG
[3:29:20] <+trashamn> YEAHHHH
[3:29:21] <Fujiwara_92> NICE
[3:29:21] <%waifoong98> man, I am getting some Cosmic Break shenanigans here
[3:29:22] <dsauce999> Why does a jellyfish have judgement cut end?
[3:29:22] <%brickwall35> gg
[3:29:23] <squirtkitten> @BioApple i dont thnk the sniper was because of the perfect reload mechanic
[3:29:24] <+Nexoosen> @squirtkitten there is a new character that shoots faster than commando, but has lower chance to proc on hits as well
[3:29:24] <%maybefalco> YEYEYEYE
[3:29:25] <Ion_Laser> Nice
[3:29:25] <%spiritofmojave> ever since you did controller NV, I thought that you must experience some issues with shooting LUL
[3:29:25] <+trashamn> power of jump
[3:29:26] <GUNxSPECTRE> Also, doesn't help that twin-pistols are weak
[3:29:28] <%skizzuto> get back in the teleporter zone or you'll never finish
[3:29:29] <%GoldeNOVA> Don't choke
[3:29:31] <CptBritches> See, "easy mode" is still perfectly challenging
[3:29:31] <lloyddboy> RUN
[3:29:31] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat a lot about the combat is learning how to kite enemies. It's why you don't need only damage items in the game. Instead, any item is fine as it contributes more to the survivability of your character.
[3:29:33] <IMCthulhu> @AngriestPat get to the red circle to stop the spawning

[3:30:02] <%BioApple> @sourceofall sort of? I'd pin it down to a lack of content this early but it's mostly that you've only seen the first two levels and starting item pool

[3:30:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> Turrets are fine, but great near the teleporter. They deal constant damage, leaving you free to heal or hide, and generate money for you. Drones are mobile but weaker, and I know healing drones exist.

[3:33:17] <Monkeyweed21> items are for survival levels are for DPS
[3:33:25] <%GoldeNOVA> Let's go Lava Worm!
[3:33:43] <+DrPoxx> Overcharged Worm here we come!

[3:33:53] <CptBritches> You didn't have enough money
[3:33:59] <+Sxy_T_Rex> what happens when you get so many items it fills that top box?
[3:34:06] <RevolverKeonet> they keep going
[3:34:06] <zipfile777> how is a game?
[3:34:09] <+DrPoxx> spills over underneath
[3:34:11] <%skizzuto> @MementoExtasis he did one run of the original and didn't like it so he never played again
[3:34:14] <%Ninestempest> @Sxy_T_Rex it gets bigger!
[3:34:19] <lejeune> issa good
[3:34:20] <+theKingRamses> i don't think you have a cap for collecting items
[3:34:25] <%castcode> deja vu
[3:34:26] <+Haarute> You can keep stacking forever.
[3:34:28] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat turns into 2 lines lol
[3:34:33] <%BioApple> the cap for collecting items is your RAM
[3:34:38] <%NWR_James> Just like real life
[3:34:40] <%GoldeNOVA> In a TV maybe
[3:34:41] <+Sxy_T_Rex> so what happens if you fill the screen?
[3:34:41] <%ThePuddingDead> for u it was unplayable
[3:34:42] <%ElenaManetta> Aren't you used to being 3 pixels tall??
[3:34:42] <MementoExtasis> would your big monitor help? LUL

[3:34:47] <%Niney_Who> Also change scale
[3:34:47] <+Mokkakahvi> @AngriestPat it's because you didnt use the scaling options
[3:34:47] <rosemon5001> maybe because of the huge tv?
[3:34:47] <+Renkaru> the original is better on a small screen

[3:35:23] <FantasticHaz> LUL
[3:35:28] <natebud> crowbar is ok
[3:35:28] <%Cavumentum> Cavumentum subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Get items, make number BIG
[3:35:30] <foreverN2dust> crowbar is good
[3:35:30] <kuningaz45> Pat hates being shorter than Ben Shapiro
[3:35:30] <reonome> CROWBAR IS GOOD
[3:35:33] <%velemi> crowbar is super good
[3:35:34] <%Laecerelius> It's mroe damage, pat
[3:35:35] <+NiktenKing> Crowbar is good if you stack them
[3:35:35] <%Niney_Who> Crowbar is good
[3:35:36] <reonome> stacked anyway
[3:35:36] <+trashamn> crowbar is good
[3:35:37] <Fujiwara_92> crowbar is fine
[3:35:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That easy icon on the top right reminds me of the superintendent from ODST
[3:35:38] <KasiCrafter> Crowbars stack, tho!
[3:35:41] <Sanyle> @Renkaru give the man a break hes trying
[3:35:44] <%NWR_James> I hear crowbar is good
[3:35:44] <Mr_Strut> How dare you insult crowbar?
[3:35:45] <%spiritofmojave> Leave Gordon alone jermaPluto
[3:35:46] <+DrPoxx> I hope you get Huntress on this run, She is my favorite. Auto locking attack a bouncing Xena Shakram style attack a teleport and arrow rain. oof so fun
[3:35:46] <natebud> Crowbar means your first hit does more damage @AngriestPat
[3:35:47] <%Laecerelius> fuck, you always want more damage but once you get it you're all pissy
[3:35:50] <SunsetJack> ehh
[3:35:52] <KasiCrafter> Pretty much everything stacks if you have multiple, really.
[3:35:54] <%BestTeaMaker> crowbar is great, more damage
[3:35:54] <lejeune> chill!
[3:35:56] <+Nexoosen> one crowbar = good, any more the diminishing return is strash
[3:35:57] <%BioApple> more damage to healthy enemies -> one shotting weak bois easily
[3:35:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat: "i want more damage items" also Pat: "fuck you damage item"
[3:36:01] <lejeune> chat u so mad
[3:36:03] <%skizzuto> it's just a straight damage up as long as you're hitting an enemy above a certain threshold of hp
[3:36:04] <SunsetJack> You need to have the enemy to be beyond 90% health.
[3:36:04] <%velemi> significant damage increase
[3:36:05] <+Andrizzleton> i can't tell if this game is fun or annoyingly repetitive
[3:36:09] <BoBoCatBurger> “I want damage” “fuck you crowbar”
[3:36:12] <+DrPoxx> It is so fun
[3:36:20] <+Renkaru> I feel like this game would be fun with friends
[3:36:20] <CptBritches> DO NOT SPEND
[3:36:21] <+DrPoxx> Way funner with more people
[3:36:22] <%skizzuto> stacking increases the damage up and lowers the threshold iirc
[3:36:28] <+drepolam> it's mostly good if you have larger hits
[3:36:40] <MementoExtasis> is darkest dungeon 2 a thing?
[3:36:40] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat save lunar coins, it's annoying but they're needed to unlock a character
[3:36:44] <+drepolam> stacking does not lower the threshold, afaik
[3:36:45] <%Ninestempest> yes
[3:36:45] <CptBritches> DAT GUITAR
[3:36:49] <+Mokkakahvi> i honestly think they should make huntress a second character you dont need to unlock just to babbies whit shitty aim have something to play
[3:36:49] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Stealthboi? We night kin now?
[3:36:50] <reonome> SourPls

[3:37:46] <hntronium> Coin keep yes
[3:37:46] <%ThePuddingDead> ur char looks like my halloween costume when i was 9
[3:37:53] <reonome> i mean across runs
[3:37:54] <giga_bit> The first game had an even better soundtrack.
[3:37:55] <+NiktenKing> Luckily you have whip
[3:37:56] <KasiCrafter> Man, this game looks like the most video gamey video game; something you see people playing in the background on TV shows.
[3:37:57] <worldbrand> It's nice to see the levels still have a fair bit of verticality
[3:38:04] <+Mokkakahvi> @reonome oh no you made the same mistake i did
[3:38:06] <jacknerik> @ThePuddingDead What was the costume
[3:38:07] <Fujiwara_92> I legit think I'll buy this game just cause of the ost
[3:38:11] <+NiktenKing> That's good
[3:38:12] <SunsetJack> I usually run around the edge map for chest.
[3:38:13] <MementoExtasis> PogChamp

[3:38:25] <californaya> can you fuse the crowbars?
[3:38:25] <+Nexoosen> the ost isnt as good as the first imo but still good
[3:38:27] <sileo_patronus> I think it's just more flat and open
[3:38:29] <+drepolam> theres even a secret in this map
[3:38:29] <californaya> A DOUBLE CROWBAR
[3:38:29] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat so the way the game flow works is that you decide if you want to stay to keep getting more/better items, or if you want to leave sooner to avoid the levels getting harder
[3:38:31] <reonome> @Mokkakahvi I'm so mad I could have gotten artificer
[3:38:32] <+DrPoxx> We in there BOIS
[3:38:33] <CptBritches> Crowbar is actually decent especially when stacked
[3:38:34] <+Renkaru> can you even use the items on the top, or are they passive?
[3:38:36] <%ThePuddingDead> @jacknerik i tried goin as a transformer...with stuff around the house
[3:38:37] <%Niney_Who> STAY BACK
[3:38:37] <KasiCrafter> Wait. If Pat calls ever item bad, the [CRAZY TALK] will make it good! Kappa
[3:38:38] <+Terran_Gell> More damage is never a bad thing

[3:39:08] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat a lot of this is determined by your first few upgrades, so if you feel like you need more items, then feel free to stay, just know that you are making future levels possibly harder

[3:44:21] <natebud> teleporter
[3:44:21] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat here's a tip about sprinting. Sprint in this game is an instant toggle, so right after you dodge/attack/get damaged, you can click the sprint button in midair and you'll instantly be in the sprint state as soon as you land.
[3:44:25] <%skizzuto> missed the teleporter
[3:44:26] <Xhog1> Just came in. How’s this game so far?
[3:44:27] <+DrPoxx> My favorite things about the items is how they actually appear on your character
[3:44:29] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat I saw an ace combat at my game store for the ps3, was it any good or did u play it at all? it wasnt a numbered sequel
[3:44:32] <GoYaK> Is this like a Binding of Isaac but 3D ?
[3:44:34] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Does this game have a summoner character? I'm quite partial to those
[3:44:35] <CptBritches> Well, you can just auto resolve battles unless it's a really important battle, but I love how the battles feel because it really feels like you are controlling a LOT of men at a time
[3:44:36] <%mister_rogers> so ten glasses is 100 percent crit?
[3:44:44] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat also, your Beetle Guard is a permanent friend. Even if he dies, he will come back after a short amount of time.
[3:44:46] <sukiyakiwestern> @mister_rogers yuup

[3:55:43] <CptBritches> All them jumps
[3:55:44] <+Haarute> You can ping stuff in this game. I don't know what the binding is on controller though.
[3:55:44] <+DrPoxx> You dropped a banner at 1 chest so that will be easy to find
[3:55:45] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat How are you liking the game now that you are huge?
[3:55:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> holy shit I thought that was a third chest for a second
[3:55:49] <sileo_patronus> lucky
[3:55:51] <Fujiwara_92> SourPls
[3:55:54] <RevolverKeonet> THe beetlemo line shall rise again at the mercy of their lord, commando PAT
[3:55:56] <%rubbishbinge> Beetle is Not Crash
[3:55:58] <%waifoong98> almost there
[3:56:02] <lejeune> this music slaps
[3:56:04] <%spiritofmojave> Music is actually really solid
[3:56:05] <%Niney_Who> 300 more coins
[3:56:09] <MonocleCoyote> the crits Pog
[3:56:11] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Almost 2k
[3:56:13] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> the plan is clear
[3:56:15] <cerberuscarmine> this games great
[3:56:16] <%Cavumentum> Just look for the particle effects coming off of it, helps me keep track of the damn thing
[3:56:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> diplmacy was never an option
[3:56:24] <+theKingRamses> the way the beetle moves kinda reminds me of DOG
[3:56:27] <%GoldeNOVA> Go listen to the Risk of Rain 1 soundtrack as well, that's also amazing.
[3:56:32] <reonome> ELDER LEMURIAN
[3:56:41] <sevelodon> oh no
[3:56:41] <SunsetJack> Crappp
[3:56:43] <TSUKl> oof
[3:56:44] <%Rngiddion> YOOOOOOO
[3:56:44] <%Laecerelius> Yeah!
[3:56:44] <giga_bit> OOOOOH NOOOOO
[3:56:44] <RevolverKeonet> boooooooooooooo
[3:56:46] <Ner234> LUL
[3:56:46] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @theKingRamses oh man you're totally right
[3:56:48] <%waifoong98> LUL
[3:56:48] <reonome> thats meh
[3:56:49] <Fujiwara_92> NICE
[3:56:49] <MementoExtasis> headhunter Kreygasm
[3:56:50] <+notorious_rng> noooooo
[3:56:51] <%El_Desperad0> wack
[3:56:51] <%Niney_Who> It's good at the point you're at now
[3:56:51] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat They were wrong, it's garbage
[3:56:52] <lejeune> i'm gonna go play the first one after
[3:56:53] <%Laecerelius> Bleh
[3:56:55] <%El_Desperad0> 3
[3:56:57] <lejeune> bc im poor
[3:56:59] <TSUKl> PoE headhunter
[3:56:59] <Fujiwara_92> IT'S GOOD NOW
[3:56:59] <natebud> usually elemental damage it seems
[3:56:59] <+Nexoosen> It can be ok, but im not a fan
[3:57:01] <byobuer> does the jellyfish power still kill you?
[3:57:03] <CptBritches> I mean, it's alright, but there are way better ones
[3:57:04] <%waifoong98> RNG giveth RNG taketh
[3:57:05] <%spiritofmojave> How common are they, because that seems kinda situational
[3:57:07] <%maybefalco> its good when elites actually spawn
[3:57:09] <sileo_patronus> Seems like people are divided on that one
[3:57:10] <cerberuscarmine> its good because elites spawn all the time now
[3:57:10] <%Niney_Who> It's spilling over LUL
[3:57:11] <+DrPoxx> Now open a few smaller chests to ease grind for next chest
[3:57:12] <SunsetJack> There is another gold chest.
[3:57:12] <%ArcanumMBD> It's garbage because lightning elites will halve your hp
[3:57:13] <Lulu19> OPETHATS WAY BETTER
[3:57:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The light has been lit, the path made clear, now we need only the strength to walk it
[3:57:21] <%velemi> no
[3:57:26] <CptBritches> Don't worry, you won't ever totally run out of enemies
[3:57:34] <%BestTeaMaker> BECOME FAST
[3:57:35] <+smevvster> God I hope he fights a Magma Worm here
[3:57:37] <aimlesshealer> Ah man, it's gonna take forever to farm up another 2000
[3:57:38] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> Its much better later, when most enemies are elites and you have 1-2 powers on constantly
[3:57:38] <foreverN2dust> fuck off red whip
[3:57:38] <Fujiwara_92> I AM SPEED
[3:57:39] <+DrPoxx> Unless you activate portal
[3:57:43] <RevolverKeonet> @sileo_patronus the thing is, that item can be a run ender. Shield elites, when you absorb their power, halve your life and replace that with shields
[3:57:44] <+EternalInquisitor> pat are you going for the second gold chest?
[3:57:44] <+Terran_Gell> brass contraptions hit so hard
[3:57:45] <RevolverKeonet> that have to charge
[3:57:48] <%GoldeNOVA> Don't worry, things will get crowded real soon
[3:57:49] <+Haarute> I want to see how fast this goes.
[3:57:50] <%Mekhet09> I would just leave.
[3:57:52] <%Reizie_Etherealm> SANIC
[3:57:53] <lejeune> red whip make u naruto
[3:58:00] <a_mad_dragon> are charged worms in the game yet?
[3:58:06] <reonome> YEAH DO IT

[3:58:10] <Fujiwara_92> DO THE TELE
[3:58:10] <Lulu19> YES
[3:58:11] <%castcode> so fast
[3:58:14] <MacMog> A NEW CAR!
[3:58:14] <%Laecerelius> yeah
[3:58:15] <Fujiwara_92> yeah
[3:58:15] <thegreenbenis> TELE
[3:58:16] <%maybefalco> @a_mad_dragon yes, and they suck
[3:58:20] <%velemi> yeah, skip the second gold
[3:58:21] <+Nexoosen> @a_mad_dragon Yes. they are QQ
[3:58:21] <Fujiwara_92> get the chests
[3:58:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if Pat ever heard of Kenshi, even though I don't think it's his style at all
[3:58:22] <+NiktenKing> BIG SPEED
[3:58:23] <%Niney_Who> YESS more Syringe
[3:58:29] <Monkeyweed21> save gold chest fir after boss
[3:58:29] <%Laecerelius> oooh! more damage up!
[3:58:33] <reonome> GO FAST
[3:58:33] <hntronium> DRUGS
[3:58:35] <CptBritches> Missile drone
[3:58:35] <%Niney_Who> That's a Drone he's useful
[3:58:35] <lejeune> is the first game better with controller or keeb?
[3:58:35] <%spiritofmojave> Those syringes are super busted
[3:58:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> Get it
[3:58:36] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @a_mad_dragon charged worm is the Blue version of worm
[3:58:40] <%velemi> good drone
[3:58:42] <cerberuscarmine> drone boyos!
[3:58:43] <natebud> drone good
[3:58:44] <aimlesshealer> UP go the number
[3:58:44] <+theKingRamses> that might've been a drone
[3:58:45] <%Cavumentum> Love that percentage stacking
[3:58:48] <+DrPoxx> Also there is a ping system that can help you identify things
[3:58:48] <CptBritches> Drones really distract the enemies, they are legit worth it
[3:58:49] <+Fyre_link> healing drones are very good
[3:58:50] <reonome> that was a drone
[3:58:51] <+BKNPham> @AngriestPat If you ping items they tell you what they are
[3:59:01] <%ArcanumMBD> @Cornerstoneofmediocrity it's garbage all the time. If you steal a lightning buff half your hp becomes shields. When the buff runs out, you're at half hp. Super easy to die from it late game when things can chunk you
[3:59:09] <%TheShal> Drones are just robot stands
[3:59:20] <Fujiwara_92> 314 was the drone
[3:59:23] <%Niney_Who> Missile drones are good
[3:59:26] <IMCthulhu> missile droens will help with flying enemies a lot
[3:59:28] <+SimplyPandaz> so is pat having more fin now
[3:59:32] <+SimplyPandaz> fun*
[3:59:44] <sukiyakiwestern> he picked up the shitty legendary again oh noooo
[3:59:45] <+DrPoxx> those die
[3:59:45] <%Laecerelius> he's progressing a lot more
[3:59:45] <IMCthulhu> you keep them until they die
[3:59:46] <SunsetJack> They die
[3:59:47] <giga_bit> They die
[3:59:48] <%Niney_Who> They die
[3:59:48] <%BestTeaMaker> you keep flying drones
[3:59:48] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat having fun on easy. Next FromSoft game he will be asking for an easy mode
[3:59:49] <Fujiwara_92> those die
[3:59:50] <+BKNPham> @AngriestPat There is also a golden chest in underneath a a rock in this level that is a guaranteed red item
[3:59:50] <+NiktenKing> They die
[3:59:51] <foreverN2dust> they die but you can repair
[3:59:51] <%skizzuto> they die and you have to pay to revive them
[3:59:51] <%velemi> if they die they're gone
[3:59:52] <TSUKl> you keep them between stages, but if they die they are gone
[3:59:53] <ketchuo13> They die, but you can fix them for money
[3:59:54] <natebud> If they die, you pay to repair them, they repair over time @AngriestPat
[3:59:54] <%BestTeaMaker> but they will die
[3:59:55] <cerberuscarmine> they die BUT they are hard to hit
[3:59:55] <sileo_patronus> They die for good, but they get hit less
[3:59:58] <CptBritches> They can die but they are very hard to kill
[4:00:00] <+Nexoosen> if they die, they die, but they fly so enemies have a real hard time killing them @AngriestPat
[4:00:02] <lejeune> seems like it
[4:00:04] <cerberuscarmine> super worth tho
[4:00:05] <+theKingRamses> the beetle is part of one of your items, drones last as long as their hp stays
[4:00:05] <%Laecerelius> they die but they're flying so they don't get hit that much
[4:00:05] <ButterscotchSoda> YEYEYE
[4:00:06] <+NiktenKing> YO
[4:00:09] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> @ArcanumMBD But the damage over time, damage buffing, aoe on every shot, and exploding kills slap
[4:00:09] <buerdo> They die
[4:00:09] <+EternalInquisitor> YEYEYEYE
[4:00:09] <Fujiwara_92> 3 bandoliers LUL

[4:00:12] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:00:14] <%Niney_Who> Pat has the apatBig Strong
[4:00:14] <lejeune> yeyeye
[4:00:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Yeeeaaaaah!
[4:00:18] <%Keaton_x> Your character looks like someone spent $50 at the dollar store toys section and just kitbashed everything together.
[4:00:23] <%GoldeNOVA> Look at that shot speed tho
[4:00:26] <RevolverKeonet> the best way fir drones not to die is GET MORE DRONES
[4:00:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> This is a good last run for the stream if I've ever seen one

[4:00:55] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat once you get deep enough, I always recommend health drones. they can help with builds without healing
[4:00:55] <%Laecerelius> heal drone!
[4:01:02] <hntronium> Do healing drones heal drones?
[4:01:05] <CptBritches> The healing drones can heal your OTHER DRONES

[4:01:14] <thegreenbenis> BOSS

[4:01:56] <+EternalInquisitor> pat boss first
[4:01:58] <%Tucker0603> boss first for big money maybe?
[4:02:01] <reonome> you dno't want the boss on insane lol
[4:02:03] <RevolverKeonet> @AngriestPat you could get to 1500, hit teleport and then get the gold chest once you get past boss+adds
[4:02:05] <%Niney_Who> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[4:02:09] <lejeune> do boss big money

[4:02:41] <%Niney_Who> same
[4:02:46] <TwinBat> that beetle reminds me of dog and then I get sad
[4:02:50] <%Mikatonic> it'll be a lot harder if you don't do the boss now
[4:02:54] <reonome> what
[4:02:54] <%Niney_Who> Boss gives set amount
[4:02:54] <GUNxSPECTRE> Vamp is good shit
[4:02:55] <natebud> he right
[4:02:57] <dildozerfred> LOL
[4:02:59] <%Laecerelius> true
[4:02:59] <%Niney_Who> Get to 1500 and you should be good
[4:03:05] <%Mekhet09> Do the boss before the mode changes.
[4:03:07] <Fujiwara_92> ^
[4:03:07] <%Ninestempest> doing boss also spawns more enemies though 🤔
[4:03:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Fair
[4:03:14] <%Mikatonic> alright
[4:03:15] <Fujiwara_92> BIG ITEM
[4:03:19] <CptBritches> Pat is actually right for a rare occasion
[4:03:20] <+Nexoosen> @AngriestPat if you stay outside the charging area of the teleporter, enemies will still infinately spawn
[4:03:21] <+Haarute> I think we're good chat.
[4:03:21] <%velemi> that's the spirit!
[4:03:23] <+Mokkakahvi> big boy pants
[4:03:25] <reonome> you don't lose your money until you activate the teleporter
[4:03:30] <+Spr0cket> if he kills the boss but doesnt fill the teleporter wont things still keep spawning?
[4:03:33] <rosemon5001> there is also no challenge of the mountain soo this will be a bit slow
[4:03:36] <%Niney_Who> Get to 1500 first
[4:03:38] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat spawns only stop when the teleporter is fully charged, so if you leave the circle then kill the boss, you can grind off the increased spawn rates
[4:03:38] <ironulysses> How's that backseat ya'll
[4:03:39] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah that would suck
[4:03:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 some more just the tips with kirby! Drones are good, and come in several varieties, including healing! This means when you find a blood totem, you can just ride the damage cost till the end. Turrets are fine, but great near the teleporter. They provide money from their kills too, and slow down enemies. I once saw a massive purchasable robot for a ton of cash, but was teleported before I could buy it. The higher difficulty names are quite fun too. If you die in multiplayer, you get
[4:03:44] <ironulysses> is it soft?
[4:03:46] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat i fyou stay out of teleporter zone, stuff keeps spawning
[4:03:54] <%Niney_Who> AVOID LASER
[4:03:54] <%Hammerknife> wow i think pat's actually having fun now

[4:08:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 revived on the next stage. Think of crowbar as the "opening shot" allowing you to smash chunks off of enemy or boss health. For shooters this movement heavy, I recommend binding your jump to a stick press, allowing you to continuously aim while jumping or flying. Pat, you want to kill enemies fast, but that won't matter if they approach in hords. Defense is good too, and any passive or activated health is sublime.
[4:08:35] <%spiritofmojave> This movesets getting cuhrazy
[4:08:37] <%Spydurman> DPS GO UP

[4:09:05] <%Ninestempest> NG+1 BABY
[4:09:06] <%brickwall35> When I get to a similar level of OP in BOIR, my friend and I refer to it as "becoming Hubris"
[4:09:06] <foreverN2dust> They don't have many stages it seems
[4:09:07] <+StooEsq> speaking of Nuclear Throne

[4:09:09] <StaticSunrise> L00PS br0ther
[4:09:10] <Highwang> Brother can I get some Loops?
[4:09:11] <+theKingRamses> i've just been to this place before
[4:09:11] <+JavaManJoJo> Game will have more stages later, at least if it's like the first game was
[4:09:12] <+notorious_rng> there is no final boss or level currently you just loop forver
[4:09:12] <mayorrev> DEJA VU
[4:09:13] <%Spydurman> oh does early access not have a final level?
[4:09:14] <Jontman42> The game doesn't really look interesting at first glance but apparently it's good?
[4:09:14] <Fujiwara_92> NG+
[4:09:15] <+trashamn> not many stages yet
[4:09:18] <mayorrev> I've just beeen in this place before
[4:09:18] <CptBritches> They are still going to add more levels
[4:09:19] <%velemi> it begins
[4:09:19] <$cureneckbeard> The flow of time is convoluted
[4:09:19] <reonome> no ending in early access LU
[4:09:20] <sileo_patronus> There's no end boss yet so you just see how far you can tak your build
[4:09:21] <reonome> LUL
[4:09:22] <%Laecerelius> ahhh
[4:09:24] <foreverN2dust> no
[4:09:25] <natebud> You can win
[4:09:26] <CptBritches> Not yet
[4:09:26] <Onamar> Kinda
[4:09:26] <%Niney_Who> Not yet
[4:09:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> How many levels do you have to clear for merc?
[4:09:27] <+Mokkakahvi> not yet
[4:09:27] <reonome> kind of?
[4:09:27] <giga_bit> Technically.
[4:09:27] <InvaderKAZ> Not yet
[4:09:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> Yes
[4:09:30] <StaticSunrise> not yet
[4:09:31] <Saltmeisterr> does this game have suspend?
[4:09:31] <%street_sign> not yet
[4:09:31] <Fujiwara_92> not yet
[4:09:31] <FantasticHaz> You can "win"
[4:09:31] <+DrPoxx> If you reach the Obelisk you win
[4:09:31] <NeroInfinite> not yet
[4:09:32] <%skizzuto> no final boss yet, still early access
[4:09:33] <TSUKl> technically
[4:09:33] <Cornerstoneofmediocrity> @AngriestPat There is only one ending rn and no final boss
[4:09:34] <Highwang> technically by looping you have won
[4:09:34] <TootPirate> Kinda
[4:09:34] <+trashamn> early access not yet
[4:09:34] <Monkeyweed21> get to final difficulty
[4:09:35] <+JavaManJoJo> Not yet
[4:09:36] <CptBritches> The ending isn't finished yet
[4:09:36] <%Laecerelius> you already won i guess
[4:09:36] <%velemi> Not yet
[4:09:36] <%waifoong98> eh mah gawd, it is an endless cycle, just like dorkkk solesss Kappa
[4:09:38] <+smevvster> There's sort of a win-state after round 7
[4:09:38] <worldbrand> You had the option to loop in RoR as well
[4:09:39] <cerberuscarmine> there are more stages
[4:09:39] <%Niney_Who> You gotta reach the Obelisk
[4:09:39] <energywarning> can you ever really win in life?
[4:09:40] <%spiritofmojave> this is why I'm waiting on this, the early-access seems to show past the advanced levels LUL
[4:09:40] <%brickwall35> WHICH ONE IS IT CHAT lol
[4:09:40] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat there's sort of a win condition but it randomly appears. and it's a big quotes "Win."
[4:09:42] <StaticSunrise> it's early access so the final boss isn't in yet
[4:09:42] <+Haarute> Actually... no. You can't yet. You can sure as hell get a ton of secrets and unlocks.
[4:09:43] <+Nexoosen> Unlocking mercinary is not winning chat
[4:09:43] <nootsandbooter> stage 15 lets you go through a portal to win kind of
[4:09:44] <EASrake> You're only recourse is annihilation
[4:09:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> Yes you can
[4:09:49] <+trashamn> technically you won
[4:09:49] <+drepolam> merc is in delta point, 7th stage
[4:09:51] <TSUKl> you win the freedom of death
[4:09:54] <+Haarute> One of the character unlocks is the closest to an ending.
[4:09:54] <CptBritches> The ending is death
[4:09:59] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat Currently no final boss yet. Goal is to complete the challenges to unlock stuff.
[4:10:01] <zamzoph> Give it up! You can't win!
[4:10:04] <%Ninestempest> lol
[4:10:08] <reonome> you can obliterate yourself from existence
[4:10:09] <natebud> That's how you know you're doing good
[4:10:12] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> if you get to snow level again theres a thing that kills you and gives you a character unlock in exchange, thats about it @AngriestPat
[4:10:13] <FantasticHaz> The "win" is that you lose
[4:10:14] <sukiyakiwestern> YOU DIDNT WIN
[4:10:15] <%Niney_Who> Pat is so strong
[4:10:16] <%deathscythe122887> @AngriestPat In a way yes. you have to get to the snow level and go though a white portal
[4:10:17] <+EternalInquisitor> You can (not) win!
[4:10:18] <%brickwall35> @Kirby_Sauce how can he win?
[4:10:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> Yes
[4:10:21] <cerberuscarmine> yes
[4:10:21] <%Niney_Who> YES
[4:10:22] <%Cavumentum> Well, technically there's losing and then "winning"
[4:10:22] <+drepolam> chase those crabs off the cliff!
[4:10:23] <sevelodon> no
[4:10:23] <+smevvster> Get to at LEAST round 7

[4:10:32] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat get back to the lava stage and go into a Celestial Portal
[4:10:33] <%maybefalco> 7th stage has a special blue teleport that you enter to end the game
[4:10:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> IMPOSSIBLE incoming
[4:10:33] <+ArtemisCroc> oh hey has pat finally got the hang of the game?

[4:10:36] <InvaderKAZ> Keep going for the best characte4
[4:10:38] <sileo_patronus> You get an unlock at 20 levels @AngriestPat
[4:10:38] <%waifoong98> keep going until you turn into a skeleton Kappa
[4:10:44] <RevolverKeonet> @AngriestPat beating the loop levels will spawn a blue portal, use it to get to a final area where you can unlock vergil
[4:10:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> @brickwall35 annihilation
[4:10:46] <+Haarute> If you beat snow level you can get a new character and it ends the run.
[4:10:50] <%velemi> try to get to ice level again and beat it
[4:10:50] <FantasticHaz> I hope Pat finds the blue portal
[4:10:53] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat You unlock a new playable character at round 7
[4:10:56] <lloyddboy> tfw no BF (Beetle Friend)
[4:10:58] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Y'all ever just want more POWER
[4:10:59] <DojimaDetective> This video game should be called Laser Boys
[4:10:59] <+smevvster> IF you sacrifice your run
[4:10:59] <reonome> look at all those syringes LUL
[4:10:59] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat Get to the snow area again and beat it to unlock another character potentially but it will end your run.
[4:11:00] <Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat have you started to enjoy the game?
[4:11:01] <Fujiwara_92> Loop until 7th stage

[4:11:18] <thegreenbenis> Hurr tank controls
[4:11:19] <+EternalInquisitor> IMPOSSIBRU

[4:13:18] <+Wolvez_tv> @AngriestPat Is this game cross platform between PS4 and PC?
[4:13:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> item man
[4:13:20] <RevolverKeonet> @Paperware on ROR1 there's a boss that's basically an alien that has a shit ton of items like you, called scavenger
[4:13:20] <%spiritofmojave> your character is more accessory than a person
[4:13:23] <+NiktenKing> Basically Katamari-ing it
[4:13:23] <Nina96> i like it
[4:13:24] <Fujiwara_92> MORE POWER
[4:13:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Isn't that what you wanted?
[4:13:25] <%arancet> hes a human katamari
[4:13:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> A walking arsenal if you would
[4:13:30] <+Nexoosen> @Wolvez_tv i't's early access so its only on pc atm, idk if there will be though
[4:13:31] <+drepolam> chase the little spire-crab thingies off the cliff, theres an achievement/item unlock for that
[4:13:31] <Jontman42> Oh he just has all the shit strapped on him, that's awesome
[4:13:33] <SunsetJack> This is why vulture sucks
[4:13:34] <czeekyplays> he's a fallout character
[4:13:35] <%Ninestempest> @Wolvez_tv that has to be the weirdest question i've sen for a thing that's PC
[4:13:37] <%GoldeNOVA> Yeah, that's part of the LORE
[4:13:39] <VampirePeriod> @brickwall35 there are Switch files in the game already
[4:13:39] <rosemon5001> little by little your almost turning into the scavenger boss from the first game
[4:13:40] <CptBritches> God, you are firing at ludicrous speed
[4:13:49] <SunsetJack> Time to loot or leave.
[4:13:52] <%Ninestempest> yall haven't even seen the robot yet lol

[4:14:03] <Fujiwara_92> ITEM TIME
[4:14:10] <a_mad_dragon> well the cover of ROR 1 was the commando carrying a bunch of crap, now it's just represented in game
[4:14:12] <+NiktenKing> Robot is ludicrous
[4:14:14] <jacknerik> What's after imbostable
[4:14:19] <%Ninestempest> then why di dyou ask for cross play on a game you didn't know is on a consoel lol
[4:14:22] <thegreenbenis> >Risk of rain
[4:14:25] <%Ninestempest> wait did pat just ignore a shrine
[4:14:26] <thegreenbenis> >isn't raining
[4:14:27] <%brickwall35> @AngriestPat do you feel like this game avoids the issues that you have with BOIR?
[4:14:30] <sukiyakiwestern> @jacknerik I SEE YOU
[4:14:31] <%spiritofmojave> this is the least stylish doll I've seen
[4:14:37] <EASrake> @thegreenbenis It's a metaphor

[4:14:58] <jacknerik> @thegreenbenis That's cause there's only a risk, not a promise
[4:14:58] <RevolverKeonet> more roid
[4:14:59] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat when you exhaust chests, recommend the chance shrines. it can be bad RNG but ultimately it's more chances for items
[4:15:00] <+Wolvez_tv> @Ninestempest Cause the game looks fun and my friends have ps4 while I have PC??
[4:15:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LUDICROUS SPEED

[4:15:35] <%Ninestempest> @Wolvez_tv "is this game on PS4?" is the correct first question but go off i guess

[4:32:07] <+theKingRamses> she's great
[4:32:10] <+DrPoxx> You can sprint while using her m1
[4:32:10] <+Haarute> She has an auto-aim and can't shoot at super long distances.
[4:32:14] <%Niney_Who> She's super not the same also her HP is tiny
[4:32:14] <TSUKl> have to have a target to shoot
[4:32:14] <CptBritches> You can fire while sprinting and it's auto aim
[4:32:15] <SunsetJack> You need a target to shot.
[4:32:16] <natebud> commando is the basic shooty guy, everyone else is super different
[4:32:17] <%velemi> She locks on\
[4:32:17] <+smevvster> Need a target to shoot
[4:32:18] <jacknerik> Is this a lol character
[4:32:19] <%skizzuto> she has auto target and there's no enemies
[4:32:20] <SaltyJedi> how did last run end? i missed it
[4:32:20] <%El_Desperad0> She's thin af
[4:32:20] <%aishman> Lock on
[4:32:21] <reonome> she has homing bullets
[4:32:23] <+DrPoxx> but can only shoot when enemies are in range
[4:32:23] <sevelodon> because its drizzle
[4:32:27] <+Nexoosen> behind you
[4:32:27] <sileo_patronus> her normal shot has to lock on
[4:32:31] <+Nexoosen> some spawned
[4:32:33] <%ThePuddingDead> behind ya dumbass
[4:32:34] <%aishman> CAuse you jumped as they spawned
[4:32:35] <%maybefalco> huntress is lock on only
[4:32:36] <%Niney_Who> Oooh opened door
[4:32:37] <+Estuko> everyone's hiding behind you getting best v iew
[4:32:37] <CptBritches> You are running away from them
[4:32:38] <%aishman> They are spawning literally behind you
[4:32:43] <+MinimumPayne> also the bow doesnt cancel your sprint
[4:32:44] <+TripleBizzle> and the radar spawns lol
[4:32:46] <+shwayze21> drizzle LUL
[4:32:51] <natebud> pat forgot what easy was like LUL

[4:33:06] <CptBritches> You can fire while sprinting
[4:33:07] <%velemi> Pat she can shoot her primary and sprint at the same time
[4:33:08] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@SaltyJedi) (warning)
[4:33:09] <foreverN2dust> it gets weirder with other characters
[4:33:11] <%waifoong98> Time to play Diablo Kappa
[4:33:13] <+PR0MAN1> Why is huntress so thicc in this game
[4:33:14] <reonome> you can shoot while sprinting
[4:33:14] <thegreenbenis> Thicc booty
[4:33:17] <%ThePuddingDead> oh thats rly neat
[4:33:17] <+drepolam> oohs, a radar tower
[4:33:19] <%skizzuto> every character plays very differently
[4:33:22] <CptBritches> Merc is basically a character action class
[4:33:23] <sukiyakiwestern> new runs start out painful once youve discovered the crack thag is risk of rain
[4:33:24] <lejeune> dont complain
[4:33:27] <sileo_patronus> She has much better crowd control
[4:33:29] <DickRebuttle> the robot is pretty OP
[4:33:30] <+Haarute> The glaive bounce is REALLY good for airborne enemies and just general AoE.
[4:33:30] <+Estuko> @PR0MAN1 if she needs to sit down she automatically has a comfortable seat
[4:33:40] <natebud> glass cannon
[4:33:41] <%Ninestempest> @SaltyJedi he killed a shield elite, went to half hp, then jumped on a paltform with 6 exploding barrels
[4:33:43] <sukiyakiwestern> they nerfed mult today
[4:33:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fast babe
[4:33:43] <+drepolam> you can unlock an environmental log if you repair the radar tower in that cave
[4:33:44] <SunsetJack> She has low HP
[4:33:44] <+PR0MAN1> Hell yeah
[4:33:47] <CptBritches> Also, she got that booty
[4:33:49] <%ThePuddingDead> ok thats the stream errbudy
[4:33:49] <cerberuscarmine> c:
[4:33:49] <+MinimumPayne> she feels like she can chase well but its a game where you get chased
[4:33:49] <Nina96> yup
[4:33:50] <RevolverKeonet> having multiple glaives as huntress is top
[4:33:51] <lejeune> YAYAYAY

[4:34:12] <reonome> thats roguelikes for you
[4:34:12] <%ElenaManetta> Go do Gungeon Boss Rush to feel better
[4:34:13] <+seriousink> the barrels are rough
[4:34:13] <+JavaManJoJo> Sour is a good taste tho
[4:34:14] <Parapattern> Eat the lemon and grow stronger
[4:34:14] <buerdo> People love sour
[4:34:15] <SunsetJack> GG either way dood.
[4:34:15] <+gunslinger_xxiv> ceraRip ceraThump
[4:34:16] <%Kirby_Sauce> Use that feeling but like darksouls
[4:34:16] <FantasticHaz> the final boss of this game was an explosive barrel
[4:34:16] <+shwayze21> stay away from barrels, now you know
[4:34:16] <foreverN2dust> Risk of Barrels
[4:34:17] <Luesagna00> bad mustard taste
[4:34:17] <+DrPoxx> That was a great run though
[4:34:19] <thegreenbenis> BOO SALT
[4:34:20] <EASrake> Barrels BRIGHT RED
[4:34:21] <SchlongKongEduardo> understandably anticlimatic, but still cool
[4:34:21] <CptBritches> You beelined straight for an exploding death trap. They were glowing red
[4:34:21] <sukiyakiwestern> welcome to risk of rain
[4:34:22] <%Cavumentum> Gotta be careful about those explosive barrels, man
[4:34:22] <%Reaped_Psyche> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:34:22] <Sitromxe> 100% your fault.
[4:34:23] <a_mad_dragon> that was a DAMN good run
[4:34:23] <+Nexoosen> DId'ja have fun tho!?
[4:34:23] <worldbrand> I dunno i feel like roguelikes scarcely ever have "satisfying" deaths
[4:34:23] <startstoprepeat> you're always gonna die eventually
[4:34:28] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat I dont think roguelikes are for you then. Your supposed to want to do another round after something like that
[4:34:29] <+drepolam> that was a rare spawn you passed up there
[4:34:29] <Monkeyweed21> you shot the barrels right next to you
[4:34:30] <%velemi> Ahhh, but you had fun along the way, right?
[4:34:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[4:34:31] <chadmongo> @AngriestPat you where maybe about to unlock a guy with a sword
[4:34:31] <sukiyakiwestern> you eventually die and its never exciting
[4:34:31] <%Hiro01231> Not a good day for Pat huh?
[4:34:32] <Fujiwara_92> Risk of Barrels LUL
[4:34:32] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You ran into a platform full of exploding barrels
[4:34:32] <giga_bit> I was so hoping Pat would get Mercenary
[4:34:33] <%maybefalco> bright red explodey barrels
[4:34:33] <RevolverKeonet> Pat you got too huge, and so did your hubris. Great run though
[4:34:35] <%ElenaManetta> You have to unlock all chamber elevators
[4:34:36] <%Hammerknife> yeah, but you hvae to unlock it by beating the game
[4:34:39] <%Tucker0603> you were next to about 8 barrels
[4:34:39] <%Teintstein> apatElmo
[4:34:40] <+PR0MAN1> Id say the biggest problem with this game is that blazing enemies need a nerf
[4:34:41] <+EternalInquisitor> THE BAAAAABY
[4:34:42] <+NotGran> RNG based fun
[4:34:44] <lejeune> elmooo
[4:34:44] <ironulysses> @AngriestPat Hey man you played gungeon you know what this world is
[4:34:49] <CptBritches> Good Elmo boy
[4:34:49] <Ner234> Bite him Elmo
[4:34:53] <%spiritofmojave> awww
[4:34:55] <DocMadfox> Hug the Elmo
[4:34:57] <%Teintstein> da baby
[4:35:00] <%ElenaManetta> Bite him on the nose and show him who is dominant
[4:35:02] <DocMadfox> Hugging the Elmo means you win
[4:35:02] <%El_Desperad0> apatPorgmo
[4:35:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> Read the starter difficulty names
[4:35:11] <Monkeyweed21> have you got to the lich?
[4:35:13] <+Nexoosen> @PR0MAN1 you a merc main too? hahaha ;_;
[4:35:14] <%Niney_Who> But you also hated RoR 1
[4:35:15] <Calek> Monolith is a sick top down shmup roguelike
[4:35:16] <$eisigerr> with that hot take
[4:35:17] <+JavaManJoJo> go back to Risk of Rain 1 Kappa
[4:35:18] <jacknerik> They are very diffrent games so that's valid
[4:35:18] <%spiritofmojave> Goodnight Pat, chat, and baby apatWink
[4:35:19] <CptBritches> Lmao so before it's too small and unplayable now it's bad in 3D
[4:35:19] <%brickwall35> @AngriestPat hey Pat, I'm a huge BOIR fan. At first this game didn't look that interesting to me, but by the end I could definitely see the appeal. Thoughts?
[4:35:20] <%SneakTheBeak> apatBlep
[4:35:21] <%Mikatonic> that's cause you don't appreciate the jump!
[4:35:21] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat gungeon is balanced for single player and has better single player progression. RoR is multiplayer focused
[4:35:26] <%Niney_Who> You said you could consume him Pat
[4:35:27] <DocMadfox> Kiss the Emlo nose
[4:35:29] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's got a long way to go as an Early Access Title, so we'll see how it progresses.
[4:35:30] <natebud> gungeon is much better, but RoR is still good.
[4:35:33] <+smevvster> Keep in mind RoR2 is less than a week out of Early Access.
[4:35:36] <%ElenaManetta> He looks so small with his fur patted down
[4:35:37] <jacknerik> Baby pats
[4:35:41] <Monkeyweed21> you gonna have a good time on level 6
[4:35:42] <%El_Desperad0> apatBig apatWink
[4:35:48] <%Hammerknife> 100% its multiplayer focused
[4:35:48] <%brickwall35> what's the multiplayer like?
[4:35:49] <+MinimumPayne> SIMBA
[4:35:50] <%Ninestempest> ROR2 is great with 4 people
[4:35:53] <+BKNPham> good run
[4:35:54] <+EternalInquisitor> Pat please tell elmo I love him @AngriestPat
[4:35:55] <%Kirby_Sauce> Think of RoR2 like a roguelike borderlands
[4:35:55] <Ner234> Meow
[4:35:56] <PKHTjim> Really? Huh. Chat, as a fan of Gungeon, should I play Risk of Rain 1 before trying 2?
[4:35:58] <Kerroberros> Can Pat not beat the Pilot's past because he refuses to use items?
[4:36:01] <+theKingRamses> lots more items apparently spawn on multiplayer
[4:36:05] <Monkeyweed21> did you unlock the bullet?
[4:36:07] <jacknerik> BAYBEE
[4:36:08] <%Dwarfinaflask> apatHoldon apatBig apatWink
[4:36:11] <%Ninestempest> @brickwall35 more chests for more people, very hectic lol, but super duper fun.
[4:36:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> RoR2 is a Roguelike Borderlands
[4:36:15] <DocMadfox> Emlo does big jumps
[4:36:24] <+JavaManJoJo> @PKHTjim RoR1 is a good game but you totally don't need to play it
[4:36:32] <+smevvster> Oh yeah 4 friends playing RoR2, coordinating items to min-max builds, voice coms. Nothing's better.
[4:36:36] <%brickwall35> apatWink apatWink
[4:36:37] <Monkeyweed21> it's the exact same as regular gameplay
[4:36:41] <%Hammerknife> pilot's past = abuse the upper left and right corners
[4:36:54] <Monkeyweed21> just keep dodging and spamming missiles
[4:36:58] <Fujiwara_92> damn
[4:37:06] <DracaenaLeaf> THAT PURR
[4:37:15] <Monkeyweed21> it just looks different
[4:37:25] <Fujiwara_92> woo
[4:37:28] <+Mokkakahvi> 1hr to go work in retail FeelsBadMan
[4:37:38] <+allups> is he leaving now
[4:37:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> Is it a sharingan?
[4:37:45] <%Hammerknife> but yeah EtG has a bunch of stuff that's obviously single player only - stuff like slowing time and in-dungeon tasks
[4:37:47] <%ElenaManetta> When will there be a 10 year eyeball that's just a black circle with a pupil
[4:38:03] <%brickwall35> @Ninestempest the multiplayer is coop, yeah?
[4:38:11] <%Hammerknife> RoR is about as multiplayer focused as Left4Dead is
[4:38:14] <%SaltyDongs> Lies
[4:38:17] <Monkeyweed21> food is a consumable item
[4:38:19] <%Ninestempest> @brickwall35 yes
[4:38:19] <DocMadfox> I stopped watching that because you made me want to play Vampie
[4:38:24] <natebud> That is a solid schedule
[4:38:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> @ElenaManetta a half dissolved rotting eyeball
[4:38:34] <solidmsocks> hey pat
[4:39:01] <%Ninestempest> @brickwall35 it's just everything you saw, but with up to 4 people on the map, and up to 4x the items, and a lot more adds. Super hectic, super fun!
[4:39:27] <squirtkitten> @AngriestPat Kenshi's whole theme is making your own story, so if you prefer direction and objectives it wouldnt be good for you
[4:39:37] <%Hammerknife> actually now that i think about it RoR and L4D start off from the exact same basic gameplay premise
[4:39:51] <%Hammerknife> there's a large number of bots and they all chase you down and you shoot them
[4:40:01] <$cureneckbeard> !uptime
[4:40:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 40m.
[4:40:10] <%brickwall35> Sounds fun. Not going to be able to grab this until at least July, got CPA exams, but hopefully it will still have hype behind it by then.
[4:40:16] <+JavaManJoJo> crowbar is shots above 90% of an enemies health
[4:40:19] <+trashamn> COFFEE
[4:40:19] <CaptainPigeon17> RoR2 is feels way better on mouse and keyboard imo
[4:40:22] <Fujiwara_92> good tho
[4:40:25] <SunsetJack> Yea
[4:40:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> YEAH GODOT shitposting in chat
[4:40:37] <+trashamn> pat you should stream ace attorny
[4:40:41] <%Ninestempest> i'd throw coffee at pat
[4:40:43] <+trashamn> attorney
[4:40:44] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> YOU DO IT COFFEE MAN. All hail the undefeated champion
[4:40:46] <%Spydurman> LUL
[4:40:50] <Fujiwara_92> oof
[4:40:51] <%brickwall35> LUL
[4:40:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> awwww that's rough
[4:40:52] <Saltmeisterr> conflicted
[4:41:02] <+theKingRamses> it's also early access
[4:41:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> More fun with oeeps
[4:41:07] <hntronium> super beef super beef
[4:41:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> Peeps my man
[4:41:14] <hntronium> slowbeef slowbeef super beef
[4:41:14] <%Lambda_man> Lambda_man subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey Pat, love ya buddy. Would you be opposed to streaming the steam version of Dwarf Fortress? If fortress mode isn't your jam there's an adventure mode more inline with an RPG.
[4:41:15] <Caidezes> It's bland.
[4:41:15] <+MinimumPayne> easy makes the progression feel slower
[4:41:16] <SunsetJack> But like, you aren't playing it with people and also, early access.
[4:41:17] <%Hammerknife> its a game that relies on fucking about with friends to have fun
[4:41:20] <reonome> better on multiplayer imo
[4:41:21] <Saltmeisterr> cough early access
[4:41:24] <%BigNerdSam> C A S T L E S U P E R B E E F
[4:41:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BigNerdSam) (warning)
[4:41:27] <Jontman42> It looks completely uninteresting
[4:41:29] <oneterriblemistake> I prefer the look of the first game honestly
[4:41:29] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat
[4:41:31] <Nina96> THATS A LIE
[4:41:31] <+Kilik_> I way prefer RoR 2 solo
[4:41:34] <sukiyakiwestern> youre playing the most boring character
[4:41:35] <%ElenaManetta> Risk of Rain 2 looked really unfun just to walk around
[4:41:37] <+Kilik_> more loot for the loot goblin I am
[4:41:42] <Maleicus> any game is better with friends
[4:41:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I hate worse when people say the game is 'not for you, man'
[4:41:47] <Nina96> @AngriestPat i love playing monhun solo
[4:41:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> What about borderlands?
[4:41:48] <reonome> I just like getting bigger
[4:41:49] <KasiCrafter> I mean. Eating a bucket of RUSTY NAILS is more fun with friends.
[4:41:49] <+NiktenKing> You know what's fun with friends? Jail... but nobody wants to be there.
[4:41:50] <%brickwall35> Pat does hate people, that's true.
[4:41:52] <+lethallunacyx> Well i think that's just preference
[4:41:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Its about the people, not the game
[4:41:56] <%ElenaManetta> What about Borderlands which is designed for 4 players?
[4:41:58] <Fujiwara_92> anything is more fun with friends
[4:42:00] <bleugh> other people use items...
[4:42:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> RoR is a roguelike Borderlands
[4:42:00] <Arrior_Septem> I remember playing the original one, it bugged out and my save was corrupted after beating the final boss...... so I edited the files to get all the trophies and never went back in
[4:42:02] <%Hammerknife> woops - it's a weakness of that 'type' of game
[4:42:02] <%El_Desperad0> ANY GAME is fun with friends
[4:42:05] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> pat do you not have friends that you enjoy talking to
[4:42:09] <Caidezes> If you need other people to enjoy a game then the game sucks.
[4:42:10] <DracaenaLeaf> than friends??
[4:42:21] <Jontman42> "It's more fun with friends" is just saying "it's more fun with more fun"
[4:42:27] <megablaze_> I've only ever played the first RoR solo and it's one of my favorite games
[4:42:27] <%ArcanumMBD> RoR2 has merits for both solo and co-op. Saying one is better than the other is 100% preference. It's okay for Pat to not like the game you like
[4:42:30] <Nina96> @AngriestPat and u learned how to music today
[4:42:31] <squirtkitten> @Caidezes what if it is specifically built for multiplayer and co-op?
[4:42:32] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat i literally play a Tabletop game over voice chat while i play ror2 with my friends, its great
[4:42:33] <DocMadfox> I'm buying Steam Dorf Fort when I can
[4:42:33] <whittacre> IT ALWAYS HAD GRAPHICS
[4:42:36] <sukiyakiwestern> i dont know why people say its mainly for multiplayer its just not true
[4:42:37] <zamzoph> DF UI DansGame
[4:42:39] <+Dorf1> the graphics arent new
[4:42:40] <DocMadfox> Good graphics.
[4:42:41] <DracaenaLeaf> Night
[4:42:41] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Super Mario 3D World is one game that is WORSE with friends
[4:42:44] <%brickwall35> Any Youtube channel that relies on Friends is awful.......
[4:42:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> Later fuckers
[4:42:45] <Nina96> KonCha
[4:42:45] <%ElenaManetta> You're gonna have a frustrating time TOMORROW
[4:42:45] <%Hammerknife> RoR1 and 2 are not very good single player roguelikes. there are better options
[4:42:46] <+Zerodyne90> bye
