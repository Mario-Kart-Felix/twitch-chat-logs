[0:33:36] <%reonome> LUL
[0:33:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> it happens
[0:33:36] <%elicoy> @jack_s1n bunch of trash nerds i bet
[0:33:37] <%misha_kastrilevich> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:33:37] <%honeyman18> servers full baby
[0:33:37] <%miabyte> Volcano is a nice skin, it's gold
[0:33:38] <AmericanaRed> 19.99
[0:33:42] <Winner_92> "i can see a decent future for this game" server crashes
[0:33:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> except when the servers are fucky
[0:33:43] <Gamer76255> Crazy Talk again
[0:33:44] <That_Dogg> I hear there are already hackers on the PC version
[0:33:47] <+Brostress> but the current avatar is so photo realistic
[0:33:47] <+Mkingston> you should have seen the server problems yesterday
[0:33:48] <+Zutrax> the connection issues in this game are kinda bad
[0:33:49] <laschoelmachooo> future LUL
[0:33:50] <%Aeoneth> It's like a 1 in 10 occurance due to server capacity
[0:33:51] <scrublord009> SERVERS MAXED
[0:33:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh also, Hunk is in MW2019 now.
[0:33:57] <%kewlmyc> GET RID OF TEAMS
[0:33:57] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt Steam Workshop Maps
[0:33:58] <CappuccinoGuil> It's got 311k viewers on Twitch now. This game is doing pretty good
[0:33:58] <SpookyBeef7> The fact that it's also free on PSPlus is insane.
[0:33:58] <Lajong_z> free on PSN i guess
[0:34:00] <%Chichen> should exist
[0:34:02] <%Mendin> If the servers die, you gotta do the secret boss of Katana Zero
[0:34:03] <+Cobalt_Racer> pat why do you look like david cage?
[0:34:10] <%miabyte> I have 5 wins so far. I've been robbed so many times.
[0:34:11] <RavenHellkite> and modes tbh this game would work well with custom maps
[0:34:16] <%spleekle> @king_wragles I got one of your gifts psaUp psaDab
[0:34:16] <jack_s1n> PogChamp psaGief
[0:34:17] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah this game being free on PS+ on launch is dope
[0:34:18] <%honeyman18> A version where you're chain ganged to a group
[0:34:23] <AmericanaRed> THEME COURSES
[0:34:24] <%DappercatEsquire> @Cobalt_Racer Because the dog gave him emotions
[0:34:33] <+CelioHogane> Oh shit, a fried potatos costume
[0:34:34] <+brodieblu> dont think ive screamed at my tv this loud before playing this lol
[0:34:35] <+CelioHogane> that's sick
[0:34:35] <+dashdodger> game looks cool but I hate it when paid games have microtransactions
[0:34:37] <anamnesiac> sick strats
[0:34:43] <+Mkingston> Private servers with streamers would be fun
[0:34:45] <%Ranryu692> nailed it
[0:34:56] <%Mendin> Speedrun tech, taking damage boosts to save frames
[0:34:57] <%Deano8817> to divw
[0:34:58] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt goes further than a jump
[0:35:00] <%kewlmyc> extra distance
[0:35:02] <CountMeowingtonn> to be a badass pat
[0:35:03] <+LegendaryButcher> distance while jumping
[0:35:03] <RavenHellkite> so you don't trip on your ass when you land
[0:35:04] <+Delenay> japes?
[0:35:05] <%Huntercd> Battle Royale?
[0:35:06] <%Aeoneth> good for juking grabs and some jumps
[0:35:09] <+megaotter> very unpoggers
[0:35:12] <%Starotter70> If you wanna fuck someone over
[0:35:12] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:35:13] <%Alpha8087> Also knocks people around if you dive into them
[0:35:14] <%ThePushaMan> @PatStaresAt you can jump and then dive
[0:35:14] <Winner_92> the dive lets you boost yourself just a bit forward
[0:35:19] <%Dr_DangerPhD> If you're falling a long distance and dive you get up faster as well
[0:35:20] <CappuccinoGuil> I have NEVER seen someone go through the middle LUL
[0:35:22] <%kewlmyc> The middle is a trap honestly, never worth it
[0:35:22] <+moneymsa> So you dont flop
[0:35:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[0:35:25] <@SoFarFetched> Of the game designer
[0:35:25] <%ClericOfSparda> LOL
[0:35:26] <yourliteraldog> well its free on ps4 plus but idk how i feel I was ready to spend money on a full game
[0:35:29] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:35:32] <+CelioHogane> Not jumping is the failure of game design
[0:35:33] <RavenHellkite> LUL
[0:35:34] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[0:35:34] <%Aeoneth> Center fan is a trap
[0:35:36] <%Chichen> @CappuccinoGuil he did on his first try
[0:35:38] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> the dive give you more stability when landing
[0:35:38] <Gamer76255> Not jumping is failure of the game design?
[0:35:40] <leinadtonu> haha you suck
[0:35:41] <+brickwall35> FRAUD DETECTED

[0:41:32] <TheLastRhino> exactly how I describe it to my friends. Gang Beasts people but playing wipeout
[0:41:33] <%miabyte> they might be doing a collab with gang beasts at some point actually
[0:41:34] <taquito_blade> this is like a mixture of gang beasts and wipeout
[0:41:35] <dan_g_v> ah that makes sense
[0:41:38] <%kindashagg> Devolver development process?
[0:41:40] <TrashPrincessDublyn> My PS4 is fried rn ;.;

[0:41:53] <SunsetJack> I think team is random
[0:41:53] <%Aeoneth> depends on how many people are still alive
[0:41:54] <%Starotter70> Random I think
[0:41:55] <%ShawnTK_> it's random
[0:41:56] <%Chichen> usually? depends on number of people
[0:41:56] <taquito_blade> and the music is SUPER upbeat
[0:41:56] <%Excel83> Seems pretty random
[0:41:57] <%AncelDeLambert> purely random levels

[2:23:08] <MayorRev> Pat why didn't you name him baseball
[2:23:08] <%toolofparanoia> Pat how likely will it be that we have streams with that soon to be big fat bulldog sitting next to you. And us referring to him as ORB 2.... or ORB the second.
[2:23:11] <+brightman42> I honestly didn't know bulldogs could be that color, it's like finding a shiny

[2:23:29] <Coystick> "Zangief more like Zangrief" - Elmo 2020
[2:23:29] <+ZE_Count> IS he english bulldog or olde english bulldoge?
[2:23:34] <atravelbee> @That_Dogg he is going through that transition phase so they are introducing the baby slowly
[2:23:38] <DusK_The_Stray> Orb the Sequel
[2:23:47] <%ScottishMadJacko> @tutsabutz no problem
[2:23:49] <+brightman42> noice
[2:23:52] <+Grayhammatter> nailed it
[2:23:52] <+ChaosAethr> top 10
[2:23:52] <%Samurai_Mak> They are really athletic and love running around, but the breathing issues makes it so you have to make sure they don't overdo it
[2:23:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Coystick zangqueef

[2:25:08] <blackbaron98> This mode is some BS
[2:25:09] <%YakumoYomi> A true allegory for the human experience
[2:25:11] <+MelodyMedley> Aww yeah. See saw!
[2:25:13] <+The_Protagonist> yeah this game doesn't actually seem like it has much to offer
[2:25:21] <Solidnick18> oh noo
[2:25:22] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:25:24] <+The_Protagonist> which is why i'm glad i got it for free
[2:25:28] <MSN04_Sazabi> Shit looks like fucking Titanic
[2:25:34] <SolsticeZro> need to switch to Trickster
[2:25:39] <+beardy_foxbear> F
[2:25:46] <+Grayhammatter> nice job
[2:25:49] <+toastybites> I wish this game had a bit more ragdoll
[2:25:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> See Saw is fucking nuts
[2:25:56] <Zombrocom> Game feels like it needs another 50 stages
[2:25:58] <MayorRev> GORDON
[2:26:04] <%Aztec50> I would think it would be easy to add new games to this game in the future
[2:26:06] <+ChaosAethr> you got this
[2:26:07] <+terry_quest> can still make it
[2:26:16] <blackbaron98> they are comming out with more
[2:26:18] <That_Dogg> @king_wragles Awwwwwwww
[2:26:18] <+MelodyMedley> They're planning to add more in the future
[2:26:21] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[2:26:21] <+trashcansan> this music slaps
[2:26:23] <zenanon> easy peasy
[2:26:24] <%amiroodude> what a comeback
[2:26:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ez
[2:26:27] <zenanon> king shit
[2:26:36] <+MelodyMedley> Noice
[2:26:42] <+Punch_kun> has he won any yet?
[2:26:47] <%Higure_yoru> music has a splatoon vibe to it
[2:26:48] <%Excel83> DOnt call it a comeback
[2:26:53] <%DappercatEsquire> This game looks like it will live or die based on how frequently they put out new levels
[2:26:58] <MayorRev> HO GORDON
[2:26:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> top 5 bitches
[2:27:00] <+ChaosAethr> oh Fking Grabber
[2:27:03] <+The_Protagonist> yeah i figured they'd have to add more as it progressed because there's definitely not enough here to have this game have any kind of long life
[2:27:04] <MayorRev> GO
[2:27:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> winning is... somewhat random
[2:27:10] <DashXero> The balls on that final level are bullshit.
[2:27:12] <Laveyrin> true
[2:27:15] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt imagine if they add Custom Level support
[2:27:18] <%tattleworm> the hill seems to mostly come down to luck
[2:27:21] <%BubbaRands> same
[2:27:23] <Coystick> AngriestPat would've won by now
[2:27:23] <+terry_quest> well the first season runs for 2 months
[2:27:23] <DetroitSentai> Free on PS+ will help at least
[2:27:24] <CookieCutter007> !uptime
[2:27:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 27m.
[2:27:25] <%DappercatEsquire> Like bi-weekly seems like it'd be perfect
[2:27:27] <lunamight> is this some kind if battle royale stuff?
[2:27:32] <%tattleworm> but hex-a-gone is consistently winnable, i love seeing that finale
[2:27:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> they hould look at total wipeout and other similar shows for inspiration
[2:27:37] <+brightman42> hex-a-gone is easyish to win if there's like less than 8 in it, I've gotten to it with 15 before and it was a mess
[2:27:40] <2DSuperiority> people winning who already have the full Alyx gear needs a slap
[2:27:41] <%kewlmyc> Seems a bit much, maybe 5 levels every season.
[2:27:48] <Solidnick18> @lunamight abit
[2:27:49] <+ZE_Count> They should make a level randomizer in the platforming levels so their always different.
[2:27:49] <@SoFarFetched> this game is definitely good with certain streamers.
[2:27:51] <DashXero> It doesn't help that the fall guys control like shopping carts.
[2:27:53] <+Zidi0s> Season 1 lasts for 60 more days so that seems to be what their doing @PatStaresAt
[2:27:53] <%SvenHolgersson> DUDE SLIME CLIMB IS HARD
[2:27:55] <+ChaosAethr> Oh this one sucks
[2:27:59] <%king_wragles> This one is the coolest so far
[2:28:00] <+terry_quest> @lunamight pretty much minus the shut bang
[2:28:02] <+brightman42> get closer to the front, it's easier to see
[2:28:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LOSER FUCK TEAM
[2:28:09] <DashXero> Nobody likes Slime Climb
[2:28:10] <%king_wragles> @ChaosAethr I'll fight you

[3:22:08] <cureneckbeard> He's very round and fat and looks like a potato. And he owns a dog!
[3:22:11] <+poweruser> that guy was like " I dont have a tail"
[3:22:11] <Darren716> Pat you see that new Oro shit? He holds a turtle now
[3:22:23] <+mister___doctor> Would Zangief and Elmo have to become Elgief to defeat Broly
[3:22:28] <%JenovasPuppet> What a petard
[3:22:28] <%Gamblitz> is he one of those Beverly hills chihuahuas I've heard about
[3:22:34] <%Axellogic> So playing the game creates low pitch grunts and nonsense. And picking up the dog creates high pitch grunts and nonsense
[3:22:46] <+brightman42> just stay on the bottom and get them when they fall
[3:22:50] <%DensityD> SUCK IT BLUES
[3:22:51] <silentblast93> dose your mans sack make you regret that

[3:24:53] <$RealThiele> you can also dive at them
[3:24:55] <sunriser101> hold then just when they are about to jump
[3:24:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> you sort of don't. the game's options are limited
[3:24:57] <%Dakuu75> there's no real way to kill ppl
[3:24:58] <%mike2hands> psaBlind
[3:25:00] <%tattleworm> hold them for long enough and you'll push them away a little bit @PatStaresAt
[3:25:09] <%JenovasPuppet> That seems like a terrible idea
[3:25:17] <krabthecrab> This is just Wipeout Royale
[3:25:17] <Swish20XX> Stay in front
[3:25:17] <Kriss1827> how big of a pop-off can we expect when you do win @patstaresat
[3:25:18] <+gralho> is gon get fast tough
[3:25:20] <%Manwad> this game needs a smack like littlebigplanet
[3:25:20] <%joylent_blue> Dakuu75 oh yes there is lol
[3:25:23] <lunamight> @plagueofgripes so we just have to cheese it?
[3:25:31] <+brightman42> if you grab them before a jump they can fall down and get pushed but they can do it back to you so...
[3:25:40] <+MellowYellowFellow> Has Pat gotten a crown yet?

[3:26:04] <+MellowYellowFellow> Every wolf I run into is always a griefer ALWAYS
[3:26:05] <+leontalon> @PatStaresAt Its more about holding them and making them freak out, Ive grabbed people near the edge and they will jump right off trying to get away

[3:26:25] <+MellowYellowFellow> LUL
[3:26:27] <CrimsonFox777> All babies do that
[3:26:28] <Gallhint> animals dedicate brain power to cute and not to smart
[3:26:34] <%skizzuto> being recently born, they desire the sweet embrace of nonexistence once more
[3:26:34] <%Srthunda> They are testing themselves
[3:26:35] <%afronooch> poison is cool and delicious
[3:26:37] <+xeros720> humans keep a lot of tasty smelling poison around
[3:26:37] <%DensityD> gib me da poison
[3:26:38] <gag5y> Same reason why humans smoke/drink alcohol

[3:27:58] <%YakumoYomi> @RealThiele So he was full of shit?
[3:28:02] <+brightman42> why would an infomercial divulge how much shit he died with?
[3:28:15] <$RealThiele> seems so because he didnt take some bullshit supplement

[3:41:35] <%Gamblitz> get a resident evil style one where they all connect
[3:41:36] <+carltonnzz> moon2M lole
[3:41:37] <%CJett92> The WORLD is his toilet!!
[3:41:38] <krabthecrab> It's tough, because Zangief also has nice feet, beep beep
[3:41:43] <%ragingbrachy> its an infant
[3:41:43] <%DappercatEsquire> That's the Canada you dream about
[3:41:45] <+ZE_Count> teach him to fear his poop lie you
[3:41:47] <Orenjevel> is this the new fort night update?
[3:41:49] <%alcors_wisdom> man imagine not having 15 acres to let your dog to run in
[3:41:49] <+parzano> hey pat just wanted to say how much i love ur content, keep being awesome!
[3:41:51] <%SirGO0SE> teaching to pee on pads is much easier than poo
[3:41:54] <%ragingbrachy> its a dog infant
[3:41:55] <+MelodyMedley> It takes time
[3:42:02] <%SirGO0SE> mika isnt pooing inside at all but we want her to go on the pads she pees on
[3:42:06] <TheWiggly> is baby
[3:42:11] <R3c0n31> Damn he is already big at that age?
[3:42:11] <+IncendiaryStupidity> puppoes are jsut mobile poop factories

[3:46:32] <T_Sasquatch> To fuck you over
[3:46:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's just people being assholes
[3:46:32] <+BaconIncident> grabbing throws off jump timing
[3:46:32] <%de1ete_forever> how long until Nintendo makes a better version of this game?
[3:46:33] <$RealThiele> snare and pushback buildup
[3:46:34] <Spudmeister9000> LUL
[3:46:35] <%AlphaTauri> it would stop once 24 were eliminated?
[3:46:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> distract people?
[3:46:36] <Darren716> It cant actually, whoever hits first is eliminated, so you can fall and be fine
[3:46:38] <+MelodyMedley> It's just being annoying
[3:46:41] <+Regigangster> It just does Pat
[3:46:42] <+CarlosEoM> take someone with you
[3:46:45] <T_Sasquatch> Grabs can affect movement
[3:46:45] <+supportunit> give hugs
[3:46:48] <TOONFOOD> If you hold long enough, they kinda pop off you
[3:46:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> you can grab people as they're just about to be safe, I guess. it does next to nothing other than create enemies
[3:46:55] <%Strider222> this map is too easy
[3:47:02] <ha2ken> Don't stand too far up front or you might get pushed off too
[3:47:14] <Cymen90> @PatStaresAt Kill people

[3:47:27] <%GarraOfTheFunk3 > GarraOfTheFunk3  subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:47:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I would only accept them being harder if they VASTLY shortened the knockout time from someone jumping into you

[3:47:36] <Laveyrin> much harder he says
[3:47:36] <HiddenDoubT> Oh yeah they really need to up the difficulty
[3:47:36] <+MellowYellowFellow> Slime climb is the WORST

[3:47:43] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just too easy to get knocked the FUCK out
[3:47:43] <BlkFlameKami> LUL
[3:47:44] <TOONFOOD> Slime climb is actually hard now due to people at the top waiting
[3:47:45] <CrookedNoseArts> exposed
[3:47:45] <%joylent_blue> there's one course that consistently knocks out at least 60% of ppl
[3:47:45] <%ArcanumArcanum> I'm sure they're gathering data on all the games and will ramp up the difficulty on ones that aren;t eliminating people. Like the fruit matching one
[3:47:45] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[3:47:47] <+MelodyMedley> Oh craazy talk
[3:47:47] <Darren716> Fuck slime climb
[3:47:47] <Onamar> Does this game only have like five events?

[3:48:12] <%ennui_on_me> I think the race to the crown should also have you like, carry it back to a zone, so it doesn't just abruptly end and so people who fall behind aren't just out of luck
[3:48:16] <%CJett92> Slime Climb can lick my balls, one mistake and its instant death
[3:48:18] <testis1> better than a baby game for daddies
[3:48:19] <@SoFarFetched> Electric Light Orchestra

[3:48:28] <ShadeNightz> They should make it so people who are dead can come back and sabotage those who are still alive in some way.
[3:48:28] <%ArcanumArcanum> ELO is some dumb chess term
[3:48:29] <%Dakuu75> good question...

[3:51:19] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt jump then dive
[3:51:25] <$autcetera> I think the big brain play at the beginning is to watch all the balls and see where you need to be
[3:51:27] <MasterTonberry23> has pat got a win yet?
[3:51:27] <DusK_The_Stray> With Kenny Blankenship
[3:51:32] <%Dakuu75> I feel like jumping just increases your chances of getting knocked down, though.
[3:51:32] <Aydarkzero> protect your balls!
[3:51:33] <%JenovasPuppet> PROTECT YOUR BALLS
[3:51:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh wow, Beastars Chibi looks great!
[3:51:34] <Cymen90> @alcors_wisdom This is not that kinda game. You do not want people do get ladder anxiety from a party game. It only exists so new players do not get stomped

[3:53:20] <%alcors_wisdom> @Cymen90 is this a party game though? its not like you can realistically lan 50 switches in one room to play this game with its defenitely a casual game but if youre going to rank your players at all then you need to have some way of knowing where you place on that ranking
[3:53:22] <+Regigangster> Frog.... fractions?
[3:53:29] <Aydarkzero> someones gonna fake him out Kappa

[3:54:22] <Cymen90> @alcors_wisdom you can still party up with a handful of people. but does this game strike as one that needs visible MMR?
[3:54:25] <Commander_Warthog> That would be more fun with less people.
[3:54:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Frog Fractions 2 is something else. Literally, in terms of title
