[0:55:31] <ape_hawk> "no, i like being the big fish in my little pond"

[0:56:13] <gustavozxd> anarchs good old communists
[0:56:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Because Anarchs embrace Chaos and the Camarilla embrace the need to be not chaos.
[0:56:14] <LtSergei> @apostateCourier that's a very naive interpretation
[0:56:16] <%apostateCourier> Anarchs predate the Camarilla actually

[1:19:50] <RupanSen> camarilla is necessary for kindreds
[1:19:50] <DrozZombie> kinda feels like skyrim in the why you hate both main factions
[1:19:51] <%dukenux> @AngriestPat I believe that's the point. Otherwise fucking over LaCroix would be too easy of a choice
[1:19:53] <+nekomancerer> that's why you go indie
[1:19:55] <fearhurst> Papa Frank imitations from pat
[1:19:55] <+Disname23> Jack says so himself if you ask him about Nines, guy became a vampire during the great depression, he never grew out of that mindset
[1:19:55] <+thebonebard> MMMMMmmmm me, and bluuuud
[1:19:56] <$valriot> I bet Nines retweets Trump daily
[1:19:56] <gustavozxd> fukcing cammies

[1:19:59] <KeystoneA1> We also learned you want to bang Damsel and get Paige to wear a Che beret
[1:19:59] <Badgerconda_> Brujah are all sanctimonious, but at least they're sincere.
[1:20:01] <yourliteraldog> Neutral Run
[1:20:02] <HorribleHog> hon hon hon les peazanteriez lah?
[1:20:04] <%spiritofmojave> The only redeeming thing about Camarilla is that it has actual structure--otherwise FUCK that shit
[1:20:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is the general consensus that Masquerade is superior to Tru Blood? Cuz I'm getting that vibe super hard.
[1:20:05] <%connos_livereview> no gods no masters
[1:20:05] <LtSergei> talk to the homeless 2
[1:20:06] <NeoOneShin> honk if you hate anarchs

[1:20:11] <DSD24> I don't know Plague is a nice guy
[1:20:13] <@Pandora_Prime> I prefer the Tremere outlook. They're so far above all the politics but only do just enough to placate the Ventrue.
[1:20:13] <PSI_Guy95> Opposite side of town but yeah you know this place
[1:20:13] <reiju_22> I wish they made lacroix likeable
[1:20:13] <%apostateCourier> Nines would ice trump if he got the chance?
[1:20:14] <%ThePaleSage> Is it possible to side with Strauss and Strauss alone?
[1:20:14] <%dukenux> Fix Plague? But he's too powerful!
[1:20:14] <SparkAfterDark> Just because Nines is cool doesn't mean he's cool.
[1:20:17] <$Pantsravaganza> Poor plauge
[1:20:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> hot question, has little miss moral quandary returned?
[1:20:23] <LtSergei> brujah aren't sincere
[1:20:24] <NeoOneShin> sincerely stupid
[1:20:24] <Mnightshyamallama> I remember my brother always wanted to side with LaCroix, I always sided with Nines
[1:20:25] <a1u5> The point of World of Darkness is everyone is a monster

[1:21:14] <+timblenaut> LA is fine, just dull and spread out
[1:21:14] <%dukenux> Reeks of SMOG or SMUG
[1:21:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Confess
[1:21:15] <%PaladinDupre> New York ain't much better
[1:21:15] <%swordmanegill> New York is the smelliest city ever
[1:21:15] <SparkAfterDark> Pat come to Detroit we're so close it's just across the river
[1:21:16] <a1u5> EAST COAST BEAST COAST
[1:21:16] <%Remery_> The large rats that kill cats

[1:21:19] <%0dokuro> Nice stratosphere we have today
[1:21:19] <%spiritofmojave> I used to live by D.C, there's less smog there somehow
[1:21:19] <+thebonebard> plague would be nosferatu, trying to hide from everyone
[1:21:20] <DrozZombie> but these asshats might be able to be used ageist each other
[1:21:20] <%Emperor_Machinus> Too many koffings
[1:21:23] <PSI_Guy95> It cracks me up that two of my favorite games have a focus on LA
[1:21:23] <%RadicalPirate> @lewdskeletor13 thank you
[1:21:24] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[1:21:24] <SubjectX07x> This game needs a mod to update LA and put hobo poo and needles everywhere. KappaHD
[1:21:24] <%swordmanegill> Then again I live in Iceland
[1:21:25] <%Deekman> Lol I like la
[1:21:25] <%AllYouCanYeet> @MajorCrasher oh so we're gonna fight now Kappa
[1:21:26] <Bouldus> san fran literally has shit everywhere, enough to make a heat map of it
[1:21:26] <ZephyrValiey> EAST COAST BEAST COAST
[1:21:27] <KeystoneA1> Don't forget the street needles. Or literal shit on the street if you head to San Fran
[1:21:27] <alexandrecau> don't greet pat on the streets kids
[1:21:28] <+SolverCODO> Californians and especially LA has a lot of FAKE shit
[1:21:30] <fearhurst> Dont go to sanfran you'll step in human shit instead of guns
[1:21:31] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> L.A. literally cant exist, theres not enough water to sustain the population
[1:21:31] <yourliteraldog> It's the city the that should not be.
[1:21:32] <%Reaped_Psyche> At least there's little to no french people here.

[1:21:47] <%deviljhojho94> These apartments are fucking cursed
[1:21:47] <ape_hawk> its actually cleaner in the game than it is in real life
[1:21:47] <natebud> LA is just one big strip mall.
[1:21:48] <%dukenux> The Director?
[1:21:48] <Darren716> The only thing that gives NYC the leg up is that people dont pretend they arent assholes
[1:21:49] <$MajorCrasher> @allyoucanyeet LUL
[1:21:50] <dsauce999> EAST COST LEAST COAST
[1:21:52] <%manwithboxonhead> It fits
[1:21:53] <Badgerconda_> LA is also canonically the Anarch free state, which is kind of an important factor in the plot of the game.
[1:21:53] <yourliteraldog> You bitches couldn't hack here in cali

[1:36:38] <gustavozxd> this whole first floor is literally nothing
[1:36:39] <%dukenux> to show you Source enginE?
[1:36:41] <DracaenaLeaf> right?
[1:36:46] <natebud> I like that this game isn't afraid to put absolutely nothing behind a locked door.
[1:36:47] <RupanSen> maybe some hidden items
[1:36:48] <Atheistpreacher> Probably cut content
[1:36:49] <fearhurst> Damn that probably would have made everyone stop hearing that trashcan snack the roof
[1:36:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEET
[1:36:50] <AngelYoumou> @NWR_James "Less Hideous Male Hands"
[1:36:58] <%NWR_James> thats a good name
[1:36:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Dex might help with the lockpicking
[1:37:00] <DrozZombie> Brawl
[1:37:01] <transporterthesequel> HAHA apperance
[1:37:04] <%deviljhojho94> brawl is not that useful
[1:37:05] <transporterthesequel> This is the best game
[1:37:09] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Does Fat Larry sell books?
[1:37:10] <%0dokuro> Keep using fist then put it in brawl
[1:37:10] <%Laecerelius> Doesn't brawl 3 let you combat succ?
[1:37:11] <pmtriox> you'll get beastly melee weapons later
[1:37:11] <LtSergei> pat, skills are improved by two stats
[1:37:13] <Soliloquy123> @AngriestPat This whole area's kind of a weird jumble of restored content for the sake of restoring content that doesn't really do anything, IIRC
[1:37:13] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Brawl 3 is helpful for feeding, isn't it?
[1:37:14] <%connos_livereview> wait for it
[1:37:15] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Give yourself big sexy
[1:37:15] <transporterthesequel> Sex your way through the game
[1:37:16] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat You're gonna want Dodge.
[1:37:17] <%mostundesired> You don't need to fight good if you have a GUN
[1:37:17] <transporterthesequel> DO ITTT
[1:37:19] <a1u5> Chek the stats
[1:37:19] <+thebonebard> may want to up seduction so you can bite club ladies
[1:37:20] <%deviljhojho94> @AngriestPat Firearms are the magikarp of this game
[1:37:20] <%spiritofmojave> More combat stuff, melee primarily
[1:37:21] <natebud> Like breaking into every locked close would be worthwhile.
[1:37:22] <%manwithboxonhead> @angriestpat sucking the blood from a human is called The Kiss. It is essentially like sex for the person you are draining from, and they don’t really remember. Except in combat scenarios, and if you are part of the Giovanni clan.
[1:37:22] <pectusumbra> dominate or auspex
[1:37:22] <RupanSen> stamina?
[1:37:22] <%0dokuro> Use weapons pat
[1:37:23] <HopelesSoul7> @AngriestPat schoolarship give you persuasion and is more useful
[1:37:23] <LtSergei> strength is cheaper than brawl and gives you the same benefit
[1:37:27] <3xgilly> melee
[1:37:27] <starotter70> Seduction
[1:37:28] <%NWR_James> SEX IT UP!
[1:37:29] <%Validuntil2077> GUN
[1:37:34] <pectusumbra> auspex gives you extra mental stats like bloodbuff

[1:47:13] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Play the game till it dies. We need to see it jank
[1:47:13] <$RubberFistFight> @TheBigO75 when he was playing Sekiro someone fucked up and convinced him to do Kotaro's quest wrong, because they just assumed he'd done the white pinwheel bit, and he hadn't. And then they refused to help him because "spoilers".

[2:00:38] <NeoOneShin> They aren't really, they just do loads of damage.

[2:00:40] <%SolidusRex> Hate to spoiler it chat, but the final boss of VT
[2:00:43] <%gespenst25> There is ONE gun that is amazing against vampires... well not a gun exactly.
[2:00:43] <natebud> Every vampire has been talking about how scary shotguns are since you started this game
[2:00:43] <nekodelic> melee ftw
[2:00:44] <%Ilpala> that's what our friend jake the dog said!
[2:00:45] <%shotgang86> shotguns are amazing against anything, specially in this section of this game
[2:00:46] <%TheBigO75> Shotguns are always a problem solver
[2:00:47] <cacophanes> lethality is what determines ddamage against vampires
[2:00:48] <Heyestus> They're not too damaging but they have knockback @AngriestPat
[2:00:49] <%bobofabyss> guns get super good later on but are pretty meh for a long time, at least in my experience
[2:00:49] <%SolidusRex> MB is Sans
[2:00:50] <NeoOneShin> Bladed weapons kill vampires fast
[2:00:54] <aazv17> Jack says in the beginning that shotguns are good against vampires
[2:00:56] <%apostateCourier> the flamethrower is sadly p garbage here
[2:00:58] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, guns are good if you're a vamp clan with Auspex to buff em
[2:00:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Scholarship
[2:00:59] <nobody12349> fire arms FIRE ARMS
[2:01:00] <PSI_Guy95> when you get the actual proper revolver then guns get good

[2:01:38] <DomunDomunDomun> That's why Blade's so good at killing vampos.

[2:24:01] <%Faustgesicht> tbh i love the combat physics in this game
[2:24:01] <3xgilly> Are there skeletons in this game? *asking the important questios*
[2:24:03] <$RubberFistFight> @Teintstein it's a Source game LUL
[2:24:04] <%Dio_TR> USE MASS SUICIDE
[2:24:07] <simulationbard> I don't know much about WoD but doesn't basically every supernatural creature exists in some fashion
[2:24:12] <+Zer0Heartz> eat zomboi ass
[2:24:13] <%connos_livereview> this game is VERY serious
[2:24:15] <3xgilly> questions
[2:24:16] <+Grayhammatter> kung fu vampire mage
[2:24:16] <thetruthofyourbeing> MAN i should really go to bed

[2:24:18] <%swordmanegill> this part is a wierdo mess
[2:24:18] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I love the ragdolling in this game
[2:24:19] <%dukenux> It;s true
[2:24:20] <%crimsonharvest> we talked about this they prefer Punch Wizard
[2:24:21] <%dukenux> He is THE ONE
[2:24:22] <Heyestus> @simulationbard correct

[2:24:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> He's beginning to believe
[2:24:35] <LtSergei> you can get blood back by salvoing in large groups
[2:24:35] <damienlunas> Skeletons are a myth perpetuated by Big Milk
[2:24:37] <Midnight188> in NWOD no they were seperate
[2:24:37] <mr_slaide> Everybody loves Kung Fu fightin.
[2:24:37] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat The zombies spawn infinitely here until you get to the boss arena
[2:24:38] <PSI_Guy95> @simulationbard they have a god damn frankenstein tabletop game where the goal is "you are an artificial creation trying to acquire a real soul", WoD is INSANE
[2:24:40] <$RubberFistFight> @swordmanegill the whole fucking GAME is a weirdo mess.

[2:35:45] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> these guys are walking blood consumables...
[2:35:46] <+thebonebard> what determines if he gets blood back from his blood atack
[2:35:47] <CptBritches> You need to be using your blood to damage him Pat, you are just wasting blood by killing them early
[2:35:47] <%swordmanegill> he's killing his health packs
[2:35:48] <Habblewater> just knock them away if you need to
[2:35:50] <%bobofabyss> use them to refill, don't kill them at the beginning
[2:35:51] <a1u5> You only get blood bacm if they live
[2:35:51] <Darthwaffler> Hit, but don't get hit.
[2:35:54] <%0dokuro> he is
[2:35:55] <Badgerconda_> Pat you just wasted all your blood killing the zombies that don't matter. You only need to kill Vick.
[2:35:55] <+neo_cosmos> you are literally using up all of your portable health vials
[2:36:01] <1MegaMan10> All your health packs are dead
[2:36:03] <DracaenaLeaf> great fight

[2:36:05] <PSI_Guy95> thrilling battle
[2:36:05] <rovilm> very high iq tactics right here
[2:36:06] <tinypouf> no need to kill all zombos, just burn him down mostly
[2:36:07] <Badgerconda_> Dodge his shotgun blasts and then fuck him up while he reloads.
[2:36:09] <%0dokuro> no for blood
[2:36:11] <LtSergei> if you use salvo, you get more back
[2:36:11] <$Slimshazbot> git gud

[2:36:22] <SophisticHades> chat was meming
[2:36:22] <RutlerTheButler> dont use blood salvo on one target
[2:36:23] <eldritchmoeblob> @r0gamer940 Hello!
[2:36:24] <%connos_livereview> id like to take this time to tell you all that greatest game of all time resident evil 4 came out a mere year after this game
[2:36:25] <+MrMcCrabby> the disease doesnt actually matter to you as a vampire
[2:36:25] <Conky89> This fight was a pain in the ass with a melee character if you don't have the right powers available
[2:36:27] <BigCoffee> Use blood heal and blood buff, use blood salvo to refill
[2:36:27] <RutlerTheButler> use the single target one
[2:36:29] <dsauce999> You mean how you have been doing while killing all of them?
[2:36:29] <%swordmanegill> it's fine you purist
[2:36:30] <+jimmybeegood> overwhelm him with punches
[2:36:30] <PowerfulBlackGangs> You can duck behind that table
[2:36:33] <DracaenaLeaf> Melee him
[2:36:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> now use bloodpack
[2:36:34] <%The_Esquana> The_Esquana subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! you ever donate blood Pat, and if not how is your fear of needles applied to it?
[2:36:36] <%Dio_TR> BLOOD HEALS you no matter what @AngriestPat
[2:36:36] <eldritchmoeblob> @r0gamer940 You're just in time for PURE gameplay
[2:36:37] <%TheBigO75> brain goblins
[2:36:41] <%Laecerelius> There is no blood heal
[2:36:41] <NeoOneShin> There is no blood heal
[2:36:41] <+jimmybeegood> I remember winning this by making him vomit then punching him a bunch
[2:36:41] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> That guy naruto teleported
[2:36:44] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> just saying
[2:36:48] <%bobofabyss> blood salvo uses a specific amount of blood and you regain a certain amount per character hit, disease doesn't matter there
[2:36:48] <$RubberFistFight> Geometry Lord Patrick
[2:36:51] <RutlerTheButler> blood heal is plus patch
[2:36:52] <a1u5> Blood salvo is multiple, regular is just as good
[2:36:56] <sir_nack> i love that the shotgun clips the audiio
[2:36:57] <%StEmlosWater> +
[2:36:58] <Badgerconda_> Pat, you can't trade with him.
[2:36:58] <worldbrand> Did he teleport? Or is he just moving really fast?
[2:36:59] <%MelBrooksKA> spyCheese spyCheese

[2:37:04] <Bouldus> GOOOOO GUNMAAAN
[2:37:07] <%Laecerelius> his shotgun is way better
[2:37:08] <a1u5> Blood shield
[2:37:09] <%spiritofmojave> Bloody buff + Shotgun might be decent with your firearms skill?
[2:37:09] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[2:37:10] <PowerfulBlackGangs> He used Obfuscate

[2:37:27] <NeoOneShin> use blood strike not blood salvo
[2:37:27] <%connos_livereview> its plus 1
[2:37:27] <%theneosloth> he put more points in gun
[2:37:27] <$Slimshazbot> shield and buff
[2:37:28] <natebud> because he's standing still
[2:37:28] <+MrMcCrabby> because his gun skill is better
[2:37:28] <%Laecerelius> because your character sucks?
[2:37:29] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Because he knows how to use it
[2:37:29] <+BioHunter> ur just weak
[2:37:29] <%chaumiester> Cuz your firearm skill is... 1
[2:37:29] <CptBritches> This fight is fine, Pat is just doing it very poorly.

[2:37:31] <+neo_cosmos> its not the shotgun its that you suck at shooting uguns
[2:37:32] <+thebonebard> he has stats
[2:37:32] <NewWaveMasquerade> Get yourself an axe @AngriestPat
[2:37:33] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Cuz he knows how to use it
[2:37:33] <worldbrand> While you were partying, he studied the gun
[2:37:33] <TranquilTurnip> its not about the shotgun his flesh is better
[2:37:34] <%bobofabyss> yes
[2:37:34] <DracaenaLeaf> @AngriestPat Toreador vampires are better with Guns
[2:37:34] <aazv17> Wow it's like firearms skills matter
[2:37:35] <DSD24> He put it all in guns
[2:37:35] <flubber3d> coz he's an ass

[2:37:38] <Copperage> this guy is a toreador hes the gun vampire
[2:37:40] <corepool> he has points in gun
[2:37:40] <%manwithboxonhead> Good

[3:22:02] <redsynod> what a dishonest fruit
[3:22:03] <%these_pockets> this game feels like Fallout: New Vegas but with vampires. With the general graphical style and the multi-dialogue-option-focus in conversation
[3:22:03] <%swordmanegill> Fucking Pat
[3:22:10] <%Sulliman34> can you bhop in this game since its source

[3:22:31] <ミュウレ4242> when crab nipple, take a ssip.
[3:22:33] <BoneofMalkav> I think both versions of the Unofficial patch brings back a fixed version of the Library

[3:23:44] <KeystoneA1> Good choice
[3:23:44] <%spiritofmojave> LaCroix continues to be shit in this reality too
[3:23:44] <natebud> Whichever skill is lockpick

[3:23:59] <+thebonebard> you can just run and shoot blood
[3:24:01] <%spiritofmojave> All in Finance
[3:24:03] <mrgrimsmiles> my vote it percepion
[3:24:03] <+MittGaming> Gohan DODGE!
[3:24:05] <Badgerconda_> Dominate is pretty useful if you want more disicplines...
[3:24:07] <NeroInfinite> research for books
[3:24:07] <shlaggori> DOMINATE
[3:24:08] <DrozZombie> more magic lean into it
[3:24:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh yeah dont get that

[3:24:17] <LtSergei> free one in a quest later
[3:24:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Can you boost Int to get it up, though?
[3:24:19] <%shotgang86> or bump up charisma
[3:24:19] <+Justlaxy> dodge or dom
[3:24:20] <a1u5> YOUR OTHER DICIPLINES
[3:24:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> You're right, wait for that freebie
[3:24:20] <PlumpPotatoRump> resarch?
[3:24:21] <%swordmanegill> Computer or security
[3:24:23] <a1u5> DOMINATE
[3:24:24] <NewWaveMasquerade> How about lock picking?
[3:24:24] <+thebonebard> how much later
[3:24:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fair enough
[3:24:24] <%ShaneWhite> Be a big man Brawl
[3:24:25] <%Laecerelius> Dodge sounds good
[3:24:25] <SnaKemuho> you do after 2 main quests
[3:24:26] <%swordmanegill> poop
[3:24:26] <+SolverCODO> @AngriestPat everyone is gonna tell you the shit they like is the best, it doesnt mean anything. do what you want
[3:24:27] <lizard0tm> waowaowaowao
[3:24:29] <CptBritches> You do, wait for it
[3:24:30] <Conky89> If only intelligence was the be all end all stat then min-maxing would be such a breeze.
[3:24:30] <Mr_Strut> So do int
[3:24:31] <Covil91> Int is also research
[3:24:33] <+PenmanLupine> Just don't max it out
[3:24:34] <%Afterman_> other skills give research
[3:24:36] <Animal_Farm4> Leveling combat abilities, the actual worst part of the game PepeHands
[3:24:38] <byobuer> dominate is cool
[3:24:39] <LtSergei> dominate has good ones
[3:24:39] <$trias_e> auspex might be worth thinking about, helps with hacking and guns
[3:24:40] <a1u5> Dominate
[3:24:42] <%Laecerelius> They don't make people explode
[3:24:42] <HopelesSoul7> dodge is useless for a ranged character
[3:24:43] <%theneosloth> dominate gives you dialog options
[3:24:46] <PSI_Guy95> Auspex is garbage
[3:24:48] <%Afterman_> fuck the other disiciplines
[3:24:49] <%SolidusRex> Dominate is only useful if you're a ventrue.
[3:24:49] <Paperware> Piccolo would be proud
[3:24:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's hard to remember all the free shit you're gonna get
[3:24:52] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat, run a Gangrel build doit
[3:24:55] <ValidVenasaur> dominate gives you espcial dialogue
[3:24:55] <+ballsackmonster> dominate is good for dialogue options
[3:24:55] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat Suicide is useful because it can't be traced back to you
[3:24:56] <SnaKemuho> can Tremere even dominate in dialogue?
[3:25:01] <+thebonebard> low lockpick score is triggering me
[3:25:01] <KeystoneA1> Thaumaturgy trumps all other Tremere disciplines
[3:25:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[3:25:04] <byobuer> yesssss
[3:25:05] <rovilm> Dominate me Pat
[3:25:06] <dzdandcnfsd> @theneosloth only for ventrue I think
[3:25:07] <%SolidusRex> Only Ventrue get dialogue options.
[3:25:07] <natebud> Frenzy PogChamp
[3:25:07] <count_bob> They can't @SnaKemuho
[3:25:07] <ミュウレ4242> intimidation or subterfuge can be fun.
[3:25:09] <NewWaveMasquerade> Some of Dominate will come in handy @AngriestPat
[3:25:09] <%swordmanegill> mass suicide is good ability'
[3:25:09] <DrozZombie> its really good
[3:25:10] <nekodelic> yeyeyeye
[3:25:11] <$nademonkey1100> step on me prease
[3:25:12] <LtSergei> you don't get dominate dialogue unless you're ventrue
[3:25:14] <%SolidusRex> Do not listen to the other guys.
[3:25:15] <@Pandora_Prime> Auspex can make you lockpick harder
[3:25:15] <DracaenaLeaf> no where

[3:25:26] <lizard0tm> was the gunshot a real one or just distant sound effect?
[3:25:28] <%swordmanegill> YES
[3:25:30] <Huntercd> Pat does not strike me as a Dom.
[3:25:30] <%theneosloth> @dzdandcnfsd oh yeah I was thinking of malk
[3:25:30] <%OldOnyx> Tremere get the dom dialogue options with the plus patch only
[3:25:31] <%swordmanegill> Finally

[3:34:27] <$Slimshazbot> @zamzoph She's from a offshoot vampire clan that needs to eat flesh instead of drink blood
[3:34:27] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Daran Norris voices this guy. He also voiced Belze from God Hand

[3:35:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this is getting mean
[3:35:07] <flubber3d> bad but necessary
[3:35:08] <PSI_Guy95> Convenient that everyone lives in the same god damn apartment or hotel
[3:35:08] <Ion_Laser> gotta protect the Masquerade I guess
[3:35:09] <randomp141> @AngriestPat He had a photo of a hungry Nosferatu
[3:35:10] <+KatanaMancer> fucking end the tokyo ghoul
[3:35:11] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "He was gonna die anyway, why die quickly and drained while he can die slowly while being consumed?"
[3:35:12] <%JJCheeker> This place is reminding me of that nurse game you guys played on ShitStormm
[3:35:15] <TwinBat> what's the haps

[3:35:20] <3xgilly> the haps
[3:35:21] <PSI_Guy95> the haps bro

[3:35:24] <%ECRead> dont bro me bro
[3:35:24] <%solomonpun> @Firesparks the last time humanity found out, the inquisition happened. So probably.

[3:35:31] <DracaenaLeaf> YOU SOLD IT?
[3:35:31] <+Neale2theMusic> This game reminds me of deus ex

[3:35:33] <Badgerconda_> It'll come up later Pat
[3:35:34] <LtSergei> hold on to it
[3:35:35] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Vamps used to do whatever but they pushed people too far
[3:35:35] <%lessclams> later
[3:35:35] <Rincewind1998> @Firesparks I'm not super familiar with this setting, but from this game's dialogue it seems like hunters are a pretty serious threat to vampires
[3:35:37] <%0dokuro> Later
[3:35:38] <%SolidusRex> You'll be able to use it later.
[3:35:39] <%Niney_Who> Later
[3:35:39] <+thebonebard> later
[3:35:40] <SnaKemuho> it's his own fault for playing with bullshit
[3:35:41] <starotter70> Later
[3:35:41] <KeystoneA1> You'll get to send it to a Nosferatu later for nudie posters

[3:35:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Ye snitch on those filthy nosferatu
[3:35:56] <a1u5> OTHER BUILDING
[3:35:56] <PSI_Guy95> There's a whole sidequest where you give items to a guy for porno posters of in game characters
[3:35:56] <TwinBat> Skyline pat
[3:35:58] <RupanSen> wrong place
[3:35:58] <+avantgard3n> Wrong building
[3:36:09] <PSI_Guy95> That's not a joke. Its a whole questline for posters for your haven
[3:36:10] <%SolidusRex> Hotels do NOT equal Apartments
[3:36:10] <Darthwaffler> To be fair, he would have been stupid if he stayed.
[3:36:18] <$Slimshazbot> @PSI_Guy95 Ooooh 2004...
[3:36:22] <ameraaaaaa> really
[3:36:29] <%OldOnyx> You could have sent Patty to Pisha as well if the order was reversed
[3:36:31] <%Validuntil2077> there are a shitload more humans than vampires and most vampires cant survive a full mag from an m16
[3:36:35] <Conky89> There is a reason why vampires do not want there cover blown. They can get hunted down by an ancient order of vampire assassins. This is stated in the beginning of the game.
[3:36:36] <%AncelDeLambert> eh, they're just cheesecake, you can't actually see anything
[3:36:36] <ameraaaaaa> nude posters
[3:36:38] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Tell him it was a trick if you can.
[3:36:41] <ミュウレ4242> hunters are persistent, but not that strong. werewolves are a real problem.
[3:36:41] <RiffRaff1138> They're NUDE posters, but I don't know if you could call them porno, you don't see anything
[3:36:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> 2004, back when BMX XXX was still considered a smart move
[3:36:49] <ameraaaaaa> really
[3:36:51] <%dukenux> Guess what. Guns kill vampires. You're in America.
[3:36:54] <ameraaaaaa> oh ok
[3:36:55] <PSI_Guy95> they're smutty and they're all of ingame characters
[3:36:59] <+Noxybaru> Sure are a lot of fuckin' locks in this game
[3:37:05] <pectusumbra> honestly, boosting lockpick wouldn't be bad
[3:37:07] <3xgilly> yeah that weird place that puts chocolate in chilli...THAT skyline
[3:37:08] <DrozZombie> maybe look into more lock pick?
[3:37:10] <+Hokepoke> nice place
[3:37:11] <%TheBigO75> Shits locked the game
[3:37:13] <PSI_Guy95> a lot of the items are in OTHER sidequest areas though
[3:37:14] <%brakkathoom> closet
[3:37:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Gravure poosters?
[3:37:17] <%TeraMercier> I guess I forgot that there's officially an order of vampire hunters. I kinda just thought it was a society wide enforcement by the vampires themselves
[3:37:19] <%TIME_PUNCHER> *posters
[3:37:20] <%dukenux> Eating candy in a c loset?
[3:37:21] <+thebonebard> the lack of lockpick stats hurt me
[3:37:21] <%manwithboxonhead> Nice place
[3:37:22] <natebud> this dude has two bathrooms in an apartment
[3:37:22] <Huntercd> So nudes of Jeanette?
[3:37:24] <KaseKaizer> Jebaited
[3:37:24] <%mh9s> HAHA BIG FUNNY
[3:37:24] <lilmac64> @Firesparks Well, some of the books in the setting discuss this. In one of the last books the masquerade does get broken and it leads to mass hysteria and murders in the streets as people try to figure out who is, and isn't a vampire or ghoul. All this bloodshed awakens the antediluvian who are ancient vampire demigods who more or less conquer the planet and exterminate like a third of vampire kind for fucking up so bad.

[3:45:47] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Gotta keep the arm, it's a real handy melee weapon B)
[3:45:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> LETHALITY
[3:45:50] <%Laecerelius> 12 vs 8 fist
[3:45:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> for the quest?
[3:45:53] <conflict1914> fire axe has better lethality
[3:45:53] <PSI_Guy95> lethality is Effectiveness vs vamps
[3:45:54] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Punch harder than bullets
[3:45:55] <pectusumbra> more leathality means better vs. other vampires
[3:45:55] <PhantaniumOG> cause you have no melee
[3:45:55] <mesamus> lethality
[3:45:57] <RiffRaff1138> Buy the axe for the quest Pat
[3:45:59] <LtSergei> its for the quest, you just need to buy one weapon
[3:46:00] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Punch harder than TIME

[3:46:00] <%Bupkis7> FireAXE
[3:46:01] <finalgrinder> fireaxe has cool stealthkill animation
[3:46:01] <a1u5> You need letheality against vampires
[3:46:01] <SnaKemuho> doesn't matter you have magic
[3:46:01] <12gagerager> axes lethality is huge
[3:46:01] <+MrMcCrabby> dont bother with melee if you dont have melee skill
[3:46:04] <%connos_livereview> steamed hams
[3:46:05] <+misterfistor> I WISH i could buy an uzi for like the price of a Big Mac
[3:46:07] <%spiritofmojave> Lethality is key
[3:46:09] <leinadtonu> No wonder everyone is armed in the states.
[3:46:10] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Fire Axe does more lethal making it better v vamps
[3:46:11] <RupanSen> you need melee to use it at it's full potential
[3:46:11] <Conky89> So you sell a machine pistol for $7 but have to pay $19 for a clip. Man this vampire is not street smart.
[3:46:12] <ShichiNoBushi> "Who else would fight fire with a blade?"
[3:46:13] <+mugwugsampoo> Glock is usually chambered in 9mm
[3:46:18] <%Laecerelius> i mean lethality is what matters against the shit that can hurt you

[3:48:27] <%Dio_TR> @AngriestPat Stealth for Extra XP
[3:48:27] <randomp141> The Glock and the shotgun are MORE than enough till the next area
[3:48:28] <mrgrimsmiles> the alt fire for up close
[3:48:29] <%TeraMercier> It couldn't hit a rabbit if you were also holding the rabbit yourself
[3:48:30] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @misterfistor Then there's my answer
[3:48:30] <$Slimshazbot> @PlainSimpleTailor It's Phil LaMarr
[3:48:31] <derap41> Speaking of Deus ex is this worse than Leticia or no?
[3:48:31] <PSI_Guy95> protip, stealth is really important for story quests
[3:48:32] <%JJCheeker> No way they could afford Phill
[3:48:33] <count_bob> It is a black man.
[3:48:36] <+thebonebard> even at point blank its hard to hit with the uzi, its used against really large enemies and thats about it
[3:48:38] <%dukenux> no
[3:48:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stealth for extra XP
[3:48:41] <natebud> no
[3:48:43] <%HyraFukit> @AngriestPat It costs maybe 500 dollars for a Mosan Nagant in my neck of the woods. 350 for a decent handgun..
[3:48:47] <%dukenux> I still think Leticia's worse
[3:48:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Uzi is OP af
[3:48:47] <count_bob> They got Phil Lamar twice.
[3:48:48] <%Validuntil2077> they can super afford phil
[3:48:49] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat The Braddock can be pretty useful at point blank, but at that point you might as well be using your fists.
[3:48:54] <@Pandora_Prime> Who needs guns when you can make people literally explode with your mind?

[3:53:56] <+ballsackmonster> I had max stealth during this and it was still difficult
[3:53:56] <RiffRaff1138> @AngriestPat You can kill if you have to, just don't be seen if you can help it
[3:53:56] <Kiari13> sneak right underneath him
[3:53:59] <PSI_Guy95> @Bouldus yeah exactly. the bar underneath the number is the level of light you're in

[3:54:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> eat him
[3:54:05] <Wan6Saber> should've killed him

[3:54:09] <Bouldus> @PSI_Guy95 awwwk, that makes sense
[3:54:11] <+Disname23> the clap of the ass cheeks was too loud
[3:54:12] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Stealth Kills don't count as being detected.
[3:54:16] <overlordkog> Stealth kill the one on the right.
[3:54:20] <natebud> Not like you have to hide bodies, go crazy
[3:54:21] <derap41> no kills

[3:54:42] <natebud> Just take it, it's free
[3:54:42] <%Laecerelius> It's seven bucks!
[3:54:42] <Kiari13> what on earth is wrong with that gun
[3:54:43] <+earthboy2k> dont drink all the blood dummy
[3:54:43] <Bouldus> by the power of GUUUUN
[3:54:43] <$nademonkey1100> free money
[3:54:47] <%TeraMercier> I kinda still can't believe that fucking spotlight
[3:54:50] <DracaenaLeaf> going the wrong way I think
[3:54:50] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Auspex allows you to see auras through walls even
[3:54:50] <+MrMcCrabby> i cant believe pat is leaving behind free money
[3:54:52] <$Slimshazbot> I dunno, I just butchered my way through this
[3:54:53] <RiffRaff1138> Free ammo
[3:54:54] <LtSergei> its the other wa
[3:54:55] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Feeding and Stealth Kill's are different.
[3:54:55] <Badgerconda_> Obfuscate is a game changer for missions like this.
[3:54:58] <@Pandora_Prime> apatCanada
[3:55:00] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Get the gun you coward, even if it is useless
[3:55:02] <Badgerconda_> Pat, you can also use Trance to help with stealth.
[3:55:03] <%GoldeNOVA> Dunno if in level one it's that effective tho
[3:55:14] <$humbelpie> I made it what did i miss?
[3:55:14] <KeystoneA1> You're not getting through here without a fight
[3:55:17] <natebud> You haven't even used it, just take the free gun.
[3:55:19] <+KanjiTatsumi> PogChamp
[3:55:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> WOOF

[3:55:28] <SnaKemuho> that might be failed
[3:55:28] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, that works
[3:55:34] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@NewWaveMasquerade) (warning)

[3:58:35] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Why are you squeaking? Has Elmo noticed your a mouse?
[3:58:39] <Darthwaffler> sbfpSOB
[3:58:46] <Kiari13> ain't that how real life works
[3:58:46] <SnaKemuho> and realistic
[3:58:49] <anovertmoose> oh like how a real parking lot would be like?
[3:58:49] <a1u5> Pat... It get's MUCH worse
[3:58:50] <ameraaaaaa> did pat turn into elmo
[3:58:54] <Covil91> There are 3s on every wall
[3:58:55] <a1u5> The Tile set gets MUCH worse
[3:58:57] <natebud> sword .wav
[3:58:59] <krymzen5> it's true
[3:58:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> quiet as a mouse
[3:59:02] <RainMews> This is a Source game? Holy shit.
[3:59:02] <ScrubTheNerd> That's correct
[3:59:02] <RadSuit> Pat is invisiblessed.
[3:59:03] <%mh9s> stealth squeaks
[3:59:03] <%TeraMercier> It's cause he's getting creaky and needs oil
[3:59:05] <+earthboy2k> is this before or after the sewers??
[3:59:05] <derap41> Like a mouse
[3:59:09] <%SaltyDongs> like a mouse
[3:59:12] <SnaKemuho> final couple missions are a fuck because of that
[3:59:13] <%mh9s> before sewers
[3:59:14] <dkthefriend> before
[3:59:16] <%Mornaka> THAT'S PAT?! ithought it was a rat in game
[3:59:16] <a_mad_dragon> the gout is making him creak
[3:59:17] <%swordmanegill> Fuck this mission
[3:59:18] <NeroInfinite> pat needs to be oiled
[3:59:18] <%TeraMercier> Stream robut needs lubrication
[3:59:20] <+fatal_penguin_> Use your demon summons, Pat
[3:59:21] <LtSergei> ladder right there
[3:59:22] <%ClutchRoadagain> Paige forgot to oil her Pat before she left.
[3:59:22] <derap41> @SaltyDongs jinx
[3:59:27] <DracaenaLeaf> they can be blind
[3:59:30] <Huntercd> Will Paige play this? @AngriestPat
[3:59:32] <PSI_Guy95> conveniently placed ladders: the level
[3:59:34] <%TeraMercier> Just kill him with your huge pienis
[3:59:36] <%swordmanegill> This mission is so much janck
[3:59:37] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Use the stealth kill with the axe at least once, it's actually kinda cool.
[3:59:39] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Mice are sneaky, Mice squeak, therefore squeaking is stealthy
[3:59:41] <%Sulliman34> my coaster got stuck to my cup and just fell on my nuts
[3:59:42] <%swordmanegill> jank
[3:59:45] <LtSergei> this floor is the worst one
[3:59:46] <%IDTheftVictim> It's fun though.
[3:59:52] <+thebonebard> @Huntercd she said she had intrest in the chat
[3:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:56] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat hey pat, have you thought of collabing and play games with other streamers?
[3:59:56] <Badgerconda_> Paige playing this as a hot vampire sex kitten would be everything.
[3:59:57] <krymzen5> fixed enough
[4:00:02] <%manwithboxonhead> Yes
[4:00:02] <PSI_Guy95> if you can get the briefcase undetected you can watch them murder each other which is fun
[4:00:03] <%TeraMercier> Fixed like Elmo!

[4:11:58] <derap41> remember he sucks the elders dick just as you suck his except he likes it
[4:11:58] <%mh9s> the Sabbat believe in them super hard and are preparing for war against them when they wake up

[4:12:14] <KeystoneA1> For the time being
[4:12:14] <PSI_Guy95> yea and doing story missions unlocks new side stuff
[4:12:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> t-rex arms
[4:12:16] <%rdark_ksu> also why are they so worried about super ancient vamps. Does age equal power or is it just an experience thing?
[4:12:20] <+absolute_cagemony> Antedeluvians are basically gods. One of them woke up and it took like ten nukes to put it down.
[4:12:22] <+Noxybaru> mostly, yeah
[4:12:22] <%tweedler92> tiniest arms ever
[4:12:22] <%IDTheftVictim> That you can do at the moment maybe?
[4:12:22] <%BuckytheWolf> BuckytheWolf subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:12:23] <%OldOnyx> Antedeluvians are hard confirmed at this point even if the accuracy of the name isn't

[4:24:47] <%yet_another_brony> i know people who self operate likee that
[4:24:47] <%Gatzarlok> Splinter? Naw just amputate the foot
[4:24:58] <morat2255> Boxcutters can't cut veins. Veins aren't boxes.
[4:24:58] <+fatal_penguin_> @AngriestPat I got nosebleeds from Rockstar Energy Drinks, watch it man.
[4:25:00] <Rhinoprotoss> It's cause its too high?
[4:25:00] <%Typhaeon> As a very venous person I am offended
[4:25:01] <+absolute_cagemony> wait so he's afraid of knowing that he has veins?
[4:25:05] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> THATS NOT NORMAL
[4:25:05] <%spiritofmojave> Box cutters fucking would result in a blood gyzer, what the fuck
[4:25:05] <%Yokuho> Yokuho subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! You're a walking inconsistency, like a trainwreck you can't look away.
[4:25:06] <artoflec> Yeah you have to not look at it
[4:25:08] <%ECRead> i done that for a tumor on foot. probably shouldn't have but eh
[4:25:09] <%spacekataz18> Vein stuff is the worst especially when the fucking nurses MISS THE VEIN
[4:25:09] <%PlumpPotatoRump> NEEDLE!
[4:25:11] <%deviljhojho94> Just cut your foot bro 4Head LOOOOOL
[4:25:14] <%PlumpPotatoRump> NOT BOX CUTTER
[4:25:14] <%ElenaManetta> I've had to get 6 vials or whatever of blood taken out for tests and it felt like my energy was being STOLEN
[4:25:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Can't get splinters if you have no limbs
[4:25:16] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kkigomm
[4:25:16] <grayjammer> USE TWEEZERS BITCH
[4:25:17] <+SolverCODO> This one weird trick! doctors hate him!
[4:25:18] <%Nope80808> Fuck yeah cut that shit and douse in alchol
[4:25:19] <@Pandora_Prime> A crippling fear of one's on circulatory system.
[4:25:20] <%Gatzarlok> Or amputate, can't be a problem if you don't have a foot
[4:25:21] <TotallyAHacker> or just use tweezers you tiny man!
[4:25:21] <Ya_boi_wally > That's what they did at my school
[4:25:25] <SchroedingersFerret> Amputate
[4:25:26] <$RubberFistFight> @spiritofmojave if it's geysering blood you should stop cutting.
[4:25:28] <NeroInfinite> I'd rather just use some pliers
[4:25:29] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 oh god, the sneezing and dripping just won't stop. Literal hours a day, most of the year. Today at work, when I was doing returns, I started pronouncing champagne in that asshole way, when I came to a sudden and horrifying realization. Pronounce champagne in that stupid name right now. Now think of those two god of destruction brothers from dbs. Champa and Beerus. Champagne and Beer. God DAMNIT.
[4:25:30] <Rhinoprotoss> The fuck
[4:25:30] <%castcode> Pat what if your veins were 10 times larger and everyone can see them?
[4:25:30] <Dr_Mooose> I am too
[4:25:31] <Ion_Laser> @spacekataz18 I've had that happen and it REALLY SUCKS
[4:25:32] <+SolverCODO> Pat hates being human, and flesh, and breakable
[4:25:34] <conflict1914> He doesn't like being reminded of the moisture inside himself
[4:25:36] <daisymaisy02> I need to get surgery on my foot sometime soon and have the option of local anesthetic or full unconscious surgery and I DESPERATELY want the second one
[4:25:37] <demegodz> Pat hates the human body and just wants to be a brain in a jar
[4:25:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> ...hey Pat, YOU HAVE VEINS ooooooooo!
[4:25:38] <Bouldus> Pat hates himself because he poops

[4:25:45] <%genowyn> Cuz it has liquids in it
[4:25:46] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat doesn't want to see all his inner moisture
[4:25:47] <morat2255> I also hate being a human.
[4:25:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[4:25:48] <alrobot2014> well who wouldn't be afraid of that shit
[4:25:49] <demegodz> MOist pat
[4:25:50] <Rhinoprotoss> WHAT
[4:25:51] <+SolverCODO> Hey Pat, you're a machine of meat
[4:25:52] <%genowyn> Pat if you cut the veins open you will be dry
[4:25:53] <%spacekataz18> It DOES and I am big sorry you felt that
[4:25:53] <%Jetsfantasy> Just remember, there's cholesterol in there
[4:25:53] <ameraaaaaa> personally i just use my teeth
[4:25:53] <artoflec> that part in jojo where it shows the dude holding jojo's carotid artery and he squeezes it like a spaghetti made me want to die
[4:25:55] <%spiritofmojave> @RubberFistFight Yeah, I can only picture that with such an imprecise tool for removing a GODDAMN SPLINTER
[4:25:57] <Captain_Joe1911> :D
[4:25:57] <$Lord__Ainz> Dont let the fact you have a circulatory system sink in
[4:25:57] <corepool> UNMOISTED PAT
[4:25:58] <zedravan> is this why you try to destroy it with red bull?
[4:25:59] <Ion_Laser> with BLUD
[4:26:00] <%OldOnyx> Pat would be a lousy campire
[4:26:01] <%Typhaeon> Freeze dry your blood, problem solved
[4:26:02] <%Faustgesicht> teeezers
[4:26:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> ASMR heartbeat stream
[4:26:04] <+JacktheMan18> @AngriestPat Why are you afraid of the thing that keeps you alive?
[4:26:05] <%FrostMass22> Your heart is beating right now, Pat and there's nothing you can do to stop it
[4:26:06] <%OldOnyx> campire, yeah
[4:26:07] <%mercado94> @AngriestPat human beings are disgusting so yeah. I can relate to that
[4:26:09] <%Nikopol1717> Heartbeat sounds in games make me super uncomf
[4:26:09] <alrobot2014> it feels weird when you're actively aware of the blood flowing through you
[4:26:10] <RickyRelucent> its BLUUUD
[4:26:10] <%Nope80808> BLoOd is A LiqUID
[4:26:10] <RupanSen> vampires eat veins like spaghet
[4:26:14] <%yet_another_brony> dam

[4:26:27] <%manwithboxonhead> Really
[4:26:27] <%Jetsfantasy> That's months of recovery
[4:26:29] <42nfl19> Is it cause it is a direct access highway that can spread the poison everywhere?
[4:26:30] <%Jetsfantasy> over a cookie
[4:26:31] <%ShaneWhite> You interested me everyday Pat
[4:26:33] <%Faustgesicht> Hitting an artery freaks me out
[4:26:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> I'm not allowed to donate blood. Good. I hate needles anyway.
[4:26:35] <Darthwaffler> Freaking out only makes your heart beat HARDER!
[4:26:38] <PSI_Guy95> Pat would rather the hard snap then the soft splurch
[4:26:46] <SchroedingersFerret> You can't give blood @AngriestPat. You take vitamins.
[4:26:57] <%ECRead> Good luck man!
[4:27:02] <%Nope80808> I only donated to get outta classes
[4:27:03] <damienlunas> My brother in law had a horrible fear of needles to the point where he had to try not to instinctively attack thepeople sticking him with needles. Then he got cancer and had to deal with that.
[4:27:06] <%manwithboxonhead> apatFist
[4:27:08] <$nademonkey1100> FUCK YES
[4:27:09] <$Lord__Ainz> ehh
[4:27:10] <%CaptainTubaki> way better
[4:27:10] <NeroInfinite> To be fair, losing blood is a lot more serious than breaking a bone.
[4:27:12] <+SuichiTanaka> definitely better than Injustice
[4:27:13] <%deviljhojho94> Looks ok

[4:27:33] <enoughmold> It looks less stiff
[4:27:36] <$Lord__Ainz> im more of an SF guy, so my opinion is invalid
[4:27:36] <TotallyAHacker> MK11 looks like the third strike of MK in a weird way
