[1:34:11] <DrPoxx> Pat Id be ready to spam report incase of double kill

[1:34:16] <%Jekado> too much grouping
[1:34:18] <doctor_be> Its totally Roz. the fact that pat isnt dead is enough, big brain play for roz would be to kill pat and blame it on someone else saying they did it right in front of her
[1:34:19] <Shishi1205> Win by tasks lmao
[1:34:21] <MayorRev> PUPPY
[1:34:23] <lisadagz> This group is super cautious

[1:34:48] <BlkFlameKami> all these task victories, you guys kinda suck at this
[1:34:50] <lycandruid> if the task list is short you should lower the kill cool down
[1:34:50] <%AzureGale> Power in numbers

[1:34:53] <%Laecerelius> Really needs more tasks
[1:34:54] <+jiggy_snipe> add more taks

[1:34:56] <yeetdabsenpai69> add more tasks
[1:34:57] <phatmac16> ADD MORE TASKS
[1:34:58] <Zeikier> teamwork makes the dream work
[1:34:59] <Owlboy7> impostors are too passive
[1:35:01] <%Calek> do imposters share kill cooldown?
[1:35:01] <+worldbrand> START EJECTING
[1:35:02] <restingbones> More tasks.
[1:35:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> buns and DK or Spy?
[1:35:07] <reonome> turn off confirm ejects
[1:35:07] <%Jekado> they can cheat it out buy just sticking together since they are playing with so few tasks
[1:35:10] <irfan_> either lower kill cooldown or add tasks... or both
[1:35:11] <ranarath> Either need more tasks or the imps need to be more aggressive.

[1:35:24] <Xenioplate> I'M NOT A CYCLON
[1:35:26] <OblivionSword1> might want to add more task to give the impostor more time to do things
[1:35:26] <+Vantesla> that is an issue if peeps stay group imposters don't have much options

[1:37:23] <SaltyDongs> 4 4 4 + 2 2 2
[1:37:24] <+Ran196> 433
[1:37:29] <EnderGamma> double long tasks is nerve wracking as crew
[1:37:29] <Cajjunb> here comes plague with degeneracy
[1:37:30] <%PaladinDupre> its the same as 556
[1:37:32] <EnderGamma> Gonna be fun

[1:37:34] <Zeikier> what's confirm eject do
[1:37:34] <MassConnect> make Pat imposter
[1:37:35] <ThePabe> Roz is speedrunning Zelda alongside this
[1:37:38] <$VintageSpiffy> second kill timer?
[1:37:39] <%kewlmyc> plague isn't in the room
[1:37:43] <+HeroSolaire> you're making the game too hard for the imposters, they are never winning
[1:37:44] <%TheotherKristian> TheotherKristian subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Sub number go up
[1:37:46] <@SoFarFetched> @Zeikier lets you know if they were imposter or not.
[1:37:47] <$BoxNavy> DansGame
[1:37:47] <+Vantesla> task done/survival is how crew win
[1:37:48] <@StridentSong> Kill Cooldown isn't really an issue. It's been more issues of opportunity rather then being able to rapidly kill
[1:37:48] <ThePabe> where Plague
[1:37:53] <laserbeaming> who's missing?
[1:37:53] <EnderGamma> maybe make kill cd 30 seconds?
[1:37:53] <doctor_be> you gonna look at buns without giving him a yee haw?
[1:37:54] <lycandruid> plague is building the fence
[1:38:03] <Zeikier> ah, I figured confirm was already off
[1:38:03] <+necrocannibal2> WHATS UP

[1:38:09] <Maxicqwe> buns is a girl
[1:38:12] <$VintageSpiffy> 35 second kill timer?

[1:38:13] <ThePabe> Spacer Farmer
[1:38:28] <lycandruid> kill cooldown to 25
[1:38:30] <$BoxNavy> master spy
[1:38:33] <ranarath> I mean, his name is Spy.
[1:38:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 35 seconds IS WAY too much for kill Cooldown
[1:38:36] <+jiggy_snipe> let the imposters kill really fast
[1:38:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Clemps is the Devils Advocate
[1:38:43] <%A_German_spy> spyAce
[1:38:50] <oniwahoo> Hide and Seek?
[1:38:50] <EnderGamma> 25 kill cd is too short for new people imo
[1:38:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> I would say to switch maps at some point?
[1:38:56] <EnderGamma> 30 at the lowest
[1:38:59] <+Vantesla> more speed!
[1:39:07] <ThePabe> @A_German_spy spyCheese spyCheese spyCheese spyCheese

[1:39:14] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt its for only one imposter tho
[1:39:16] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Does anyone else think Clemps sounds a little like Trevor from Rooster Teeth?
[1:39:18] <%StaceMcGate> 2 will be too much for tag
[1:39:21] <lycandruid> Pog

[1:56:11] <ranarath> This silly fighting is the best part of the game.
[1:56:11] <+JenovasPuppet> lol Clemps is literally just describing how the map works
[1:56:15] <raikagelord1> Plauge is innocent.
[1:56:15] <%MarylandJutsu> this is BONKERS BANANAS
[1:56:16] <+worldbrand> why the hell does everyone vote so recklessly only with confirmations off lmao

[1:57:01] <+jiggy_snipe> Plague has an obvious tell
[1:57:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Almond Milk
[1:57:04] <TheArrow_> this group doesn't need any imposters at all
[1:57:05] <$BoxNavy> :)
[1:57:13] <%Deano8817> it's pretty not good LUL
[1:57:14] <ThePabe> this map is so overwhelming
[1:57:18] <%MarylandJutsu> it is very terrible
[1:57:19] <InvisibleMan101> its so much smaller
[1:57:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> Tell me about it. this map is the worst.
[1:57:21] <@SoFarFetched> The true imposters were the friends we made along the way.
[1:57:23] <+UberWolfman> this is the only time i heard people complain about it
[1:57:25] <%SirFancySwank> i like the aethstetic
[1:57:31] <%SirGO0SE> i think its the second time ive seen this map LUL
[1:57:33] <%ennui_on_me> I really like this map
[1:57:41] <+atwitchical> clemps
[1:57:41] <%temporaryplaceholder> It was in the big room to the north
[1:57:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Plague went after Buna first
[1:57:44] <+jiggy_snipe> good Pat LUL
[1:57:44] <ranarath> I suspected Buns. Oops.
[1:57:45] <1matheuw> its plague hes too silent
[1:57:51] <PartyFavors> This is the least good of the three maps, but all three are good.
[1:57:56] <ThePabe> Pat is bascially just hate-voting now
[1:57:57] <%yungkame> ok plague sus
[1:57:59] <DrkJP520> What's the problem with this map?
[1:58:06] <%twistedj3ster> twistedj3ster subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Couldn't justify the PS5 controller price, PS3 disc gear broke, sold my games for almost the exact price the thing costs! What do you think about the Cybercrunch? Should I still support it?
[1:58:11] <@StridentSong> This was the map that SpaceCaptain killed me in storage, and I was just dead there for 2 minutes because no one ever found me
[1:58:13] <SleepySamsquanch> It's totally Pat.
[1:58:16] <@SoFarFetched> Someone: "I saw Space Spy" Pat: "That's pretty sus *votes*"
[1:58:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat is channeling his inner imposter
[1:58:17] <siamzero94> How they don't imediately vote Pat out for being so gung-ho is beyond me
[1:58:19] <stabbityrabbit> Pat is crazy sus.
[1:58:19] <aero160h> why don't you add a couple mods to the game and fill out the roster. also it'll be more chaotic
[1:58:21] <%Jhylla81> Kill Plague out of principal
[1:58:22] <ThePabe> OH NO IT'S VINCE MCMAHON
[1:58:23] <%SirGO0SE> plagueGripes

[1:58:46] <+jiggy_snipe> plagueFace
[1:58:47] <$VintageSpiffy> @DrkJP520 people mostly just don't like the layout. It's super hard for Imposter because of how much of the map is just hallway.
[1:58:49] <ThePabe> plague is always quiet when he pasta
[1:58:52] <@SoFarFetched> @StridentSong my tasks on this map kept being in the same area so I would be done too fast.

[2:00:02] <@StridentSong> How I vent like purple
[2:00:04] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah it always feels like you need to keep remaking the room for everyone to have a more possible chance of being imposter.
[2:00:13] <+Sochin_Iitsu> I dipped out for like 30 minutes. Did I miss anything good?
[2:00:21] <@SoFarFetched> Since RNG tends to favor specific people to keep being imposter in the same room.
[2:00:21] <Mr_Strut> Gotta be Plague, he's too smug
[2:00:28] <$BoxNavy> first try
[2:00:29] <+TeoXDR> PogChamp

[2:00:58] <%yungkame> idk guys could still be plague
[2:00:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wait I said he wasn't the killer because he was sassy
[2:00:59] <raikagelord1> I knew it wasn’t Plauge.
[2:01:09] <%SirFancySwank> plague would kill himself
