[0:16:15] <%spiritofmojave> all those green hp ups
[0:16:26] <%FusRoDom> FusRoDom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[0:16:42] <+Rose_Silver> people are paying 150k for healers per dungeon
[0:16:45] <$sylphyyyy> hahahaha clemps that was me with bb "boy i hope i don't arse myself on this stream"
[0:16:49] <%yeknomlive> yeah scatter got butchered
[0:16:50] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat What about your new follow up AoE?
[0:16:51] <+Rose_Silver> if you're a healer main, make some cash
[0:17:06] <%spiritofmojave> yeah scatter is dead Jim
[0:17:13] <%hycind53> F
[0:17:25] <%THATGUY_789> I like how only Pat's moves can be seen
[0:17:33] <+TheImmortal70> I don't know WHY they made scatter 5s cast
[0:17:37] <Sorrowful_Suicide> ricketF scatter
[0:17:50] <+TheImmortal70> Everything RDM does is literally unaspected>aspected with their dualcast
[0:17:52] <%yeknomlive> they do have aoe verthunder and aero so you dont need it as much
[0:17:52] <Jolnir> >implying
[0:18:04] <IndoorSitup> You know what's even more dead than Scatter? SCH BibleThump
[0:18:04] <%VioletHeart> They made Scatter 5s so it's a follow-up to Jolt or Veraero/thunder 2.
[0:18:09] <+Rose_Silver> you are suppose to use your second dual cast on scatter
[0:18:11] <%VioletHeart> You're meant to Dualcast it.
[0:18:15] <+Rose_Silver> and not hard cast it
[0:18:18] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah so WHY
[0:18:27] <+TheImmortal70> Why is scatter the 5s and not the others?
[0:18:42] <%VioletHeart> Because you use Veraero/thunder 2 like jolt.
[0:18:45] <+TheImmortal70> It's backwards compared to how jolt and verstone and stuff works
[0:18:59] <xeros720> oh, found the first dungeon did ya?
[0:19:05] <%bigboy3d> Damn Pat and chat are in synch!
[0:19:07] <%VioletHeart> This is a Stormblood dungeon.
[0:19:11] <+Rose_Silver> yeah its better that way tbh, diversity in your combo is nice
[0:19:15] <Jolnir> grease dungeon
[0:19:16] <+Rose_Silver> even if it's just reverse
[0:19:17] <pectusumbra> this music is cool
[0:19:21] <%spiritofmojave> this is the comfiest SB dungeon
[0:19:22] <xeros720> i was gonna comment on how it seemed really asian for shadowbringers
[0:19:56] <Jolnir> shadowbringers is worthy of an award im not even joking. its that good.
[0:20:48] <xeros720> my company mentioned on how maintaining aggro is stupid easy now, which is interesting
[0:20:59] <Soulsbjorne> where do i get my squall sword
[0:21:01] <%spiritofmojave> aggro is extremely easy to manage now

[0:21:16] <%THATGUY_789> that's good to know
[0:21:19] <$valriot> aggro basically doesn't exist now, so fuck SAM dickheads who do shit dps but can't use diversion
[0:21:22] <+Rose_Silver> if you meant where to unlock gunbreaker
[0:21:41] <Soulsbjorne> no i want my fran minion and my squall sword
[0:21:48] <xeros720> gunbreaker has a silly amount of damage buttons
[0:21:57] <%Ebonyglow> you get that stuff on the 5th
[0:21:57] <+Kavtech> Loud sound effects.
[0:22:00] <BunnyEmperor> Its impossible to lose aggro now as tanks, no more need for diversion or lucid
[0:22:14] <Jolnir> no its fine though
[0:22:16] <Soulsbjorne> @Ebonyglow really?!
[0:22:19] <%Ebonyglow> or whenever the official release is
[0:22:24] <xeros720> might need to use shirk in trials now to switch to offtanks
[0:22:54] <EmoLlama97> i would hope you were shirking in stormblood LUL
[0:23:03] <+Lost_Zombie> Machinist feels so much better tbh
[0:23:03] <IndoorSitup> Everyone except for SCH. BibleThump
[0:23:15] <%Ebonyglow> that stuff is tied to the code for shadowbringer not the preorder bonus code
[0:23:26] <BunnyEmperor> You basically shirk/voke and toggle the aggro stance
[0:23:27] <splicerss> Machinist is fun now??
[0:23:36] <splicerss> I wanna be a gun guy
[0:23:45] <xeros720> it plays like a decent dps class now, i was messing with buttons earlier

[0:24:38] <xeros720> build heat to get to heat blast and spam that, build battery to use the rook automaton
[0:24:40] <splicerss> Nice man, also why is Pat not using gunbreaker? Is it not very fun lol
[0:24:41] <Jolnir> you got fkn pwned u noob
[0:24:44] <BunnyEmperor> Healer was angry cuz not enough cds used
[0:24:50] <%Valdorick> God Pat, you sure you aren't a blackmage, BLAMING THE HEALER!?
[0:24:51] <xeros720> battery also used for Tools like drill, bio blaster, and such, i think
[0:24:55] <%THATGUY_789> prob ran out of MP
[0:25:05] <+Ell1ot> old lady?
[0:25:10] <$SleepyMaribo> dqancer buffs are nuts
[0:25:12] <%yeknomlive> mch have a combo instead of ammo/procs
[0:25:14] <xeros720> this is based on the Dragon Palace
[0:25:20] <Mexrage> ofcourse clemps get seduced...
[0:25:30] <%Valdorick> He's spamming Stone, nevermind, yeah, healer issue.
[0:25:30] <+Ell1ot> i thought healers don't dps anymore
[0:25:34] <xeros720> one of the legends goes that someone broke in and was given two gifts to leave, a small box and a big box
[0:25:34] <splicerss> Oh nice, gonna have to give mch another go later
[0:25:35] <%spiritofmojave> stone 3 to victory
[0:25:36] <xeros720> he could only open one
[0:25:37] <bagelstrider> Run into the treasure box, old people hate sex
[0:25:44] <Jolnir> i saw people arguing on reddit about how its ok for healer to dps and saying its a valid strat and not a problem for anyone
[0:25:51] <splicerss> I still gotta get Bard up too lol
[0:25:58] <MSN04_Sazabi> "OLD" is probably the most horrifying status effect
[0:26:03] <%Ascethetic> that healer is being toxic
[0:26:05] <xeros720> i believe how it went is, he opened the small box and got a big pearl, greedily, he opened the big box
[0:26:05] <%Valdorick> Healer not even healing themselves
[0:26:06] <%Kain5707> kick that healer limesHeck
[0:26:08] <xeros720> which made him turn old
[0:26:14] <%MysteryFaceX> Maybe the healer is adjusting to the new game?
[0:26:16] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat toxic
[0:26:20] <%Valdorick> He's AFK?
[0:26:22] <%Kazooki_Kazami> this white mage is

[0:28:02] <BunnyEmperor> He goes down super fast tho
[0:28:04] <MSN04_Sazabi> No-skill tanks and DPS harassing and being toxic to healers as usual, he obviously didn't heal you because you didn't deserve it Kappa

[0:29:23] <xeros720> F

[0:29:33] <IndoorSitup> F
[0:29:35] <%spiritofmojave> DRK cooldowns feel really good now
[0:29:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> So much damage
[0:29:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> press f to cast protect
[0:29:48] <baka_supreme> they basically gave MCH Inner Release
[0:29:50] <Mexrage> so...they are BRD now
[0:29:52] <+Deosier> F
[0:29:52] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat are you remembering to cast blood weapon? thats how you get your mp back and it has a low cooldown
[0:29:53] <xeros720> the Tool cooldowns are really freaking short, so you can keep doing them
[0:29:55] <%PinkSuprende> the push button class is actually smn
[0:29:56] <+beardedjho> MCH is butt fucing nutz
[0:29:57] <splicerss> I always thought Warrior felt the best to play, idk why
[0:29:59] <%PinkSuprende> I can't handle it
[0:30:21] <+valkuma> If you think FFXIV has a lot of buttons you havent played retail WoW
[0:30:21] <%yeknomlive> auto crit direct crit on a 700 potency weapon skill. also it's a drill
[0:30:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> drg is the best class
[0:30:26] <Mexrage> shorted GCD on FF14 would be a nightmare
[0:30:35] <IndoorSitup> WoWfugees are the worst.
[0:30:38] <splicerss> @rumtumtugnutz exactly
[0:30:38] <+valkuma> Even with all the "Off-GCD" buttons in FF14 its slow as fuck compared to WoW
[0:30:42] <%NWR_James> I thought it said "Treasure Coffee" which is now what I want
[0:30:44] <splicerss> Y’all sleeping on spears
[0:30:44] <xeros720> is that a katana shaped greatsword?
[0:31:00] <IndoorSitup> @xeros720 No.
[0:31:02] <BunnyEmperor> You have
[0:31:14] <Jolnir> NotLikeThis
[0:31:18] <Mexrage> it start like FF8's battle theme
[0:31:18] <Thalchampz> ilove this boss theme SourPls
[0:31:23] <%yeknomlive> i wonder if it tops this though. stormblood's boss is so amazing
[0:31:56] <%Kazooki_Kazami> i wonder if ucob will be easier now
[0:31:58] <cylish> Gonna have to agree, Im doing 3 star hunts as a 60 Gun right now
[0:31:59] <%spiritofmojave> the aoe changes overall is really noticable
[0:31:59] <Maverick2736> the soundtrack alone makes this game worth paying a subscription for
[0:32:01] <%Kazooki_Kazami> and uwu
[0:32:19] <Nitro7Ninja> is this a dungeon? sorry for noob question never played ffxiv
[0:32:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> one of the changes in the patch notes was pretty much that they made the game easier up to 70
[0:32:34] <xeros720> yup
[0:32:42] <xeros720> you 4 man dungeons in 14
[0:32:42] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat you have Blood Weapon!

[0:33:25] <vaan_ratsbane> (Protect) (Can I have it?)
[0:33:34] <%Valdorick> Xbone elite, I think?
[0:33:37] <ItsAGundamu> I'M OLD GREG
[0:33:41] <+Eclipse_knight_> does this game have a saboteur class?
[0:33:48] <%yeknomlive> the armor in this dungeon is super revealing
[0:33:48] <BunnyEmperor> Why is that chest there anyway
[0:33:53] <splicerss> How turn old
[0:33:58] <Thalchampz> SABOTENDER
[0:34:00] <+beardedjho> Cool. Havent played with controller but I am curious about trying

[0:34:59] <$i_am_therydon> "man i love accommodations for yelling at women!"
[0:35:03] <Maverick2736> this game's soundtrack makes the WoW soundtrack sound like muddled farts
[0:35:03] <xeros720> these exp numbers are silly
[0:35:04] <%Kazooki_Kazami> wait nvm im stupid
[0:35:20] <Bad1uck> This part is such big sad

[1:28:51] <arkv01> man what is it with ffxiv and cyberfuckin
[1:28:59] <mr_slaide> If it's not something that can be worn on feet, Clemps wants none of it.
[1:28:59] <%ElenaManetta> It drives bad too
[1:29:13] <arkv01> uh wow
[1:29:21] <arkv01> that almost sounds bugged

[1:30:01] <%GynecoIogist> i'm gonna guess meol is soylent green

[1:31:23] <arkv01> I would prefer it if the black fatty birb melted into the ground when you send it away
[1:31:30] <Notsocleveruser> Pat if you have cloud's bike it goes slightly faster that other mounts
[1:31:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's like if someone was microwaving fish but instead it was narf.
[1:31:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> barf
[1:32:03] <arkv01> boy I can't say I'm enjoying the aesthetic of the environs so far
[1:32:03] <Razgrizenl> shadowbringers amazing so far
[1:32:34] <%Mekhet09> Shadowbringers surprisingly topical.
[1:32:39] <+Lost_Zombie> You like politics? You like pleasure cults?
[1:32:40] <%THATGUY_789> @rumtumtugnutz how do you know what the combo of Corn Chips and Piss smells like 😂

[1:33:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you know what corn chips smell like and what piss smells like, you can extrapolate
[1:33:56] <Nina96> @MorelK most likely

[1:35:23] <emillionghost> is that clemps?
[1:35:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The combat music here is reminding me of Isis' Garden of Light, just toned way down for most peoples' palates.

[1:36:19] <$rekinom> Eyeclemps Wolf
[1:36:19] <%VioletHeart> hi cwemps
[1:36:19] <shiny_prinny> pokemon is just dead i guess
[1:36:25] <$monkeyhous3> @OldHunterYue thats eyepatch wolf
[1:36:27] <Belutima> Kinda knew, that would be it.
[1:36:31] <%cTAKU> Thanks for the PrideTake @kirby_sauce
[1:36:33] <onel0ngnoodle> oh hi cwemps you beautiful little lad
[1:36:34] <Maverick2736> yeah, Sword and Shield are going to bomb because of that
[1:36:38] <Kowtowner> delay Sword and Shield another year
[1:36:38] <emillionghost> hi cwemps

[1:37:05] <$SleepyMaribo> how does a chocobo get that fat?
[1:37:06] <+AbezethTelos> Has he gone through patch notes yet?
[1:37:07] <%THATGUY_789> it would be fine if the new iterations of poke mon didn't look like ass
[1:37:07] <bear_breaker20> get your copy of heartgold Kappa
[1:37:13] <RamenRiderZ> Make a good Pokemon alternative
[1:37:14] <Belutima> Chat pokemon Sword and Shield is not gonna bomb, its always gonna make money, as long ias the visuals is 1 procent better then the last game
[1:37:14] <+Astral_Directive> Catboi
[1:37:16] <+valkuma> Like pokemon was anything but the same game since gen2
[1:37:21] <%sshen> Just play digimon instead :^)
[1:37:26] <$monkeyhous3> The one thing they should be expected to do and they cant do it.
[1:37:27] <%JustAnotherMuffin> I agree. Lets get a Pokemon Collesum sequel.
[1:37:29] <%THATGUY_789> that corvknight is good tho
[1:37:31] <%solomonpun> most of the side games of the pokemon series are great BECAUSE gamefreak doesn't work on them.
[1:37:31] <%ElenaManetta> This expansion has been giving me a lot of Dark Cloud vibes in design and music and characters
[1:37:37] <Nina96> thats the goon
[1:37:39] <Belutima> GameFreak owns part of the Pokemon Brand, so thats not gonna happen anytime soon :)
[1:37:40] <LordFalara> thought you were gunna become a kittyman pat
[1:37:49] <Maverick2736> Nintendo is widely known to be the most bullheaded company in history. No amount of criticism will ever make em' budge on anything
[1:37:56] <Belutima> only other on is Creatures, who owns the part of the pokemon brand to make pokemon games
[1:37:56] <%ElenaManetta> any sign of him POINTS
[1:37:59] <%ElenaManetta> FUCKiNG POINTS
[1:38:01] <+case01> Heard the servers were getting ddosed, they manage to persevere through it?
[1:38:01] <%THATGUY_789> Also Sif Wolf is boss
[1:38:05] <$rekinom> Beat his ass with my thighs
[1:38:08] <vaan_ratsbane> that's a jotaro point
[1:38:14] <%madogod> guys guys... paid DLC in pokemon SnS
[1:38:15] <excedebuster> Sun and moon was the first 3D game right?
[1:38:22] <%THATGUY_789> can't stop the FF14 Hype
[1:38:23] <%VioletHeart> @case01 It was like an hour of troubles but it's fine now.
[1:38:25] <CrimsonGargoyle> C H O N K
[1:38:28] <StripesUltimateEdition> normal looking people just with cat ears look bizarre
[1:38:33] <+TheImmortal70> @case01 They took a hit for a bit, but then they just popped back up perfectly stable
[1:38:34] <%VioletHeart> @excedebuster Nah. XY were the first 3D mainline games.
[1:38:36] <+case01> @VioletHeart Good to hear
[1:38:38] <Nina96> @Eclipse_knight_ x and y

[1:57:09] <absolute_cagemony> I like the idea of Pat opening a can and it's full of centipedes and he screams.. then remembers he actually bought cans of centipedes.
[1:57:43] <%Valdorick> Why is he standing like he's pissing in the wind?
[1:57:47] <+talfurt> One time a centipede fell out of one of my inhalers when I opened it. Threw that one in the trash

[2:00:03] <%THATGUY_789> @valdorick spiders are Surprise Mechanics before EA

[2:00:08] <%rytyoung> rytyoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat and Clemps! Not really watched many of your FF XIV, or played many MMO'S personally. I played Defiance on the 360 when that came out and it that was a hot mess. Keep up the good work to both of you gents!

[2:01:19] <%Valdorick> Last month, I went into the bathroom, checked for spiders, and was content there were none... half way through my business, I look up and there's a fucking jumping spider on the lip of the door frame, just poking its head out like "oh boy, he's going to run under me and then I'll bite him!"

[2:02:57] <%Valdorick> My region shockingly doesn't have spiders - just spiders - and beyond that, MORE spiders. They eat other spiders - the winner of the spider eating tend to be the asshole spiders.

[3:16:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 they're french mmos, they both got animated shows, and wakfu takes place after dofus, when some guy gets all the maguffins and cries so hard he causes a flood event. (Makes sense in context) sick lore, one of the first dungeons you can do has you fight a series of color coordinated kung-fu mutant animal-men in a sewer by luring them out by baking pizza. It doesn't take itself very seriously, and has fun. When i played, the wikis were all in french, so it was fairly obfuscating at first.

[3:25:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Christopher Sabat, right?
[3:25:46] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah it was also Goku
[3:25:46] <reiju_22> christopher sabat
[3:25:54] <%Maids4lyfe> Sean Schemmel is the one who passed out
[3:25:58] <Dragovus> Sabat is also Piccolo and All Might
[3:25:59] <%Ranryu692> Chris Sabat is awesome
[3:26:06] <%madogod> need that japanese moaning and grunting in my anime

[3:26:11] <%ProtagonistJake> Im just staring at this Pokemon "repsonse" thanking God I got into FF and SMT. Thanks for that Pat
[3:26:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> sabat is also yami yugi so it's not all wins.
[3:26:24] <ManlyMcBeefington> @Saltmeisterr thanksw I wanted to find out that, and to atucally watch it beyond the zone animation
[3:26:27] <Ashecroft> @AngriestPat Makes me think of an airport, this hub, and not sure why
[3:26:30] <%THATGUY_789> also I think hearing another language kind of makes it seem more less silly in some way

[3:32:33] <%ArcanumMBD> The theorycrafters had it backwards! They thought Calamities caused a shard to be absorbed. Turns out it was the other way around.
[3:32:35] <MoonObscure> yes
[3:32:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> Poof
[3:32:37] <%madogod> man its been 6hours of lore so far

[3:33:05] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat have you been like streaming for 6 hours today???
[3:33:08] <%MysteryFaceX> Dimensions, Pat.
[3:33:09] <%THATGUY_789> wait wat
[3:33:09] <Bluewolf544> monkS
[3:33:11] <pectusumbra> planets or planes
[3:33:12] <%madogod> just like DBZ super
[3:33:14] <OkamiDude15> the planets are dying cloud!!!
[3:33:15] <conflict1914> we've had 7 genocides so far huh
[3:33:20] <pectusumbra> yeah, planes of existance
[3:33:28] <BunnyEmperor> nom nom nom
[3:33:28] <%Fenrirlives> so each of the fucked dimensions is a Primal manifest?
[3:33:30] <+Edrem> One of those planets was the FF Tactics sequel we'll never get now
[3:33:40] <$Dakuu75> wow, we're FUCKED~! lol
[3:33:46] <Bluewolf544> @Edrem NotLikeThis
[3:33:50] <OkamiDude15> so what happens when all the shards rejoin with the source?
[3:33:51] <Sol_Install> So the light is fucking pulling us into oblivion
[3:33:53] <%VantomPayne> @AngriestPat if you check the name of the first 6 eras and how they ended it makes much more sense
[3:33:54] <Sol_Install> that's nice
[3:33:59] <Mr_Strut> Are we gonna see the warriors of dark?
[3:34:00] <%THATGUY_789> is this Highlander planet edition
[3:34:14] <%Shadicara> Kill everything and save the woooorld
[3:34:18] <+saltyputblug> this world needs batman
[3:34:28] <$Dakuu75> floods? when's water-world expansion
[3:34:36] <%Maids4lyfe> that already happened
[3:34:37] <%Shadicara> Isn't dark knight basically batman
[3:34:39] <%MysteryFaceX> Wait, but doesn't that mean the source is becoming reassembled into it's original form?
[3:34:43] <%THATGUY_789> @dakuu75 with the smokers hopefully
[3:34:45] <%Valdorick> So wait, what the fuck was Bahumat's element? Dragon? Is he just a fucking Pokemans?
[3:34:52] <neroblind88> Viera HerbPerve
[3:35:00] <%MysteryFaceX> I think it was Dark?
[3:35:01] <$rekinom> Bahamut is Non-elemental
[3:35:02] <$Dakuu75> so do they have bunny ears AND human ears?
[3:35:02] <%solomonpun> He was dark, I believe.
[3:35:04] <%ArcanumMBD> @Fenrirlives No, primals are manifestations of aether that can tend towards elements. The fucked dimensions naturally tend towards other elements, and got overwhelmed by the element they tend towards
[3:35:06] <%Maids4lyfe> Bahamut's element is nuclear
[3:35:13] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Just bunny
[3:35:20] <%Fenrirlives> "Put each of them to the sword" that sounds like it'll backfire!
[3:35:23] <%Shadicara> Bahamut's element is just you die
[3:35:23] <$OranHexthief> so does that mean all that elemental aether is in the source now? does that mean if we stop this world from joining. the aether in the source will lean more towards darkness?
[3:35:30] <bestwaifuritsu> Theres your first dungeon
[3:35:38] <BunnyEmperor> say no and leave
[3:35:39] <$Dakuu75> that's so weird to think about, how they don't have anything where human-ears would be
[3:35:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat seems to me like the best course of action is to doomsday prep the source world to the max, then force umbral whatevers to happen. Sure it'll be bad, but it's under your terms, and then there'll be no more instances of this that CAN happen.
[3:35:43] <%ArcanumMBD> Bahamut is Unaspected. Like Salted Earth. Same colors
[3:35:43] <Bluewolf544> e
[3:35:43] <mr_slaide> Will hot bunny girl died?
[3:35:44] <ToneBacas> is it racist to say all those girls from that race look the same?
[3:35:44] <conflict1914> Bahamut's element is Bahamut
[3:35:44] <%THATGUY_789> Big Story
[3:35:59] <%Fenrirlives> Bahamut's element is AAAAAAAAA
[3:36:02] <+Edrem> The Light corrupts all Aether, which is why 4.x story was starting to talk about crystals losing all this colour and becoming pale in the Source world
[3:36:05] <%MysteryFaceX> Hmm, maybe so it's a struggle of interest?
[3:36:09] <Bluewolf544> Laku Landu
[3:36:11] <OkamiDude15> baha-blast element
[3:36:19] <+oOZtkOo> guys we dont want the shards to rejoin because then zodiark gets free
[3:36:20] <%THATGUY_789> I'm being spoiled but I don't mind because I can still enjoy the journey.
[3:36:20] <%Shadicara> The new area looks really pretty
[3:36:21] <%Unlimited_> how much have I missed?
[3:36:22] <rosemon5001> nuts for all

[3:37:46] <%Shadicara> I played machinist before my god I'm glad it got reworked
[3:37:55] <%MysteryFaceX> Maybe the Ascians just want their home back?

[3:43:23] <%THATGUY_789> @violetheart that's awesome
[3:43:29] <%Lapinelis> I like it, but it doesn't feel like it fits the world
[3:43:40] <Jflaskd13> this waddling chocobo feels like child abuse or a workout group lol
[3:43:56] <notquitedead123> Only jobbers hang out at fort jobb
[3:44:00] <Luesagna00> it looks like someone in a fat chicken suit running like in a oids show
[3:44:03] <%THATGUY_789> @lapinelis it fits just. like the lalafell
[3:44:11] <$OmegaWeltall> the music in Amh Areng is so chill i love it

[3:44:55] <alrobot2014> paige has become a muppet conspiracy theorist?
[3:44:56] <+oOZtkOo> paige you are fooled constantly by things that arent trying to fool you @AngriestPat
[3:44:58] <+Ell1ot> like a man in a business suit?
[3:45:00] <%Zundelle> which thing do you do in order to get that shadow dog?
[3:45:01] <%sshen> There was a guy near the crystal who takes the gemstones from fates for riding maps/minions
[3:45:03] <BunnyEmperor> was he reading a newspaper?
[3:45:08] <+Fynale> a lot of babies
[3:45:09] <%Toast_Master_General> Can not be fooled

[3:45:27] <ShichiNoBushi> "Dog in a suit"
[3:45:27] <%THATGUY_789> speaking of Muppets I see they added a Shoebill into the game
[3:45:29] <%Fenrirlives> paige vs muppet survival horror!
[3:45:33] <+Estuko> @monkeyhous3 why do you say that?
[3:45:36] <%THATGUY_789> did he say This Is Fine
[3:45:37] <%Toast_Master_General> Playing poker?
[3:45:50] <Bluewolf544> @Fynale where is it
[3:45:53] <haveswordmuststing> so did anyone confirm if Death Stranding is actually a videogame and not a subscription box of snacks
[3:45:53] <%madogod> 7 hours of story so far pat
[3:45:55] <+Jajanken4> that sounds awful
[3:46:02] <%THATGUY_789> @peachsaliva are you excite for Dark Crystal
[3:46:03] <+Fynale> it's on hideo kojima's twitter ya'll

[3:46:08] <%Shadicara> Thank you for encouraging me about my stormblood run pat Kappa
[3:46:16] <+Estuko> @monkeyhous3 oohh, why not?
[3:46:20] <BunnyEmperor> Ascian plotting music
[3:46:25] <%madogod> kojima needs Konami to make good games Kappa
[3:46:35] <+Estuko> @monkeyhous3 and I'm not like, messing with you. I'm actually curious about your opinion
[3:46:42] <%Shadicara> One does not simply SLAY a warden
[3:46:47] <deviljhojho94> we actually playing now
[3:46:59] <%ovan20> every enemy is a nuke D:

[3:48:02] <BunnyEmperor> FIRST DUNGEON PAT
[3:48:14] <BunnyEmperor> Please try the trust system LUL
[3:48:21] <%Shadicara> Fuck people pat Kappa
[3:48:29] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat look at tank queues first
[3:48:32] <+Edrem> It's a different menu
[3:48:37] <%ArcanumMBD> like see the queue time
[3:48:37] <Bluewolf544> playing with other humans in 2019 LUL
[3:48:37] <%myrrdraal1515> Trusts are ok, but don't pull too many packs of trash
[3:48:39] <%Dwarven_Gaming> click on them
[3:48:40] <notquitedead123> Since when did Pat start trusting people?
[3:48:43] <%THATGUY_789> yeah use the Thrust System
[3:48:45] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat if you keep an eye on them they will move to safe spots from aoes before teh boss even starts to cast it.
[3:48:45] <+SlowLikeThunder> the tank armor form this dungeon is dooope
[3:48:54] <%AgentOfParanoia> How long has this stream been going?!
[3:48:57] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL everyones leveling tanks
[3:48:58] <%Shadicara> Exactly playing with humans in 2019 LUL
[3:48:59] <%ArcanumMBD> ahaha yeah it's fucked
[3:49:06] <$Afterman_> All the GUN
[3:49:08] <TioXyco> tank queues are long, because gnb
[3:49:10] <AdmiralButtloaf> i had an 8 min dps queue
[3:49:11] <%madogod> @AgentOfParanoia probably 7 hours by now
[3:49:13] <+VariantX7> wait...theres cpu controlled party members now??
[3:49:14] <%Shadicara> Now the worlds are gagging for healers no one wants to play Kappa
[3:49:15] <%madogod> he was up pretty early
[3:49:23] <BunnyEmperor> Watch Alisae wasting the LB everytime LUL
[3:49:24] <%THATGUY_789> Crust System
[3:49:28] <+oOZtkOo> Alisae: LIMIT BREAKUH
[3:49:28] <TioXyco> @VariantX7 now there is
[3:49:29] <notquitedead123> He's all round
[3:49:30] <redrins> just have him solo the dungeon
[3:49:31] <BunnyEmperor> Take him as DPS
[3:49:32] <%ArcanumMBD> He fills any roll when you put him in. If you need a tank, he's a tank.
[3:49:32] <bestwaifuritsu> Hes just a black mage
[3:49:38] <%MysteryFaceX> A Bluemage?
[3:49:41] <%cvp5127> hacks
[3:49:44] <+Estuko> Squad Captain is 100% a top.
[3:49:47] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Yeah he'll change his weapon to whatever you're lacking
[3:49:51] <%Valdorick> Limit Break - Exists; Alisae "Its free real estate!"
[3:50:06] <notquitedead123> "Allrounder" just means he can do everything and sucks at everything
[3:50:06] <%ArcanumMBD> banger alert: the music in this dungeon is amazing
[3:50:08] <+VariantX7> god i would love this through out the whole game. I don't really like partying with humans and I could play the game and learn at my own pace
[3:50:13] <%MysteryFaceX> Why does he sound like Alphinaud?
[3:50:14] <neroblind88> WutFace
[3:50:15] <%Shadicara> Bet he's a boss you have to fight later he sounds too final bossy LUL
[3:50:16] <%THATGUY_789> Time To Learn
[3:50:17] <BunnyEmperor> Dude when I did this as SAM, Alisae always used the LB before me
[3:50:29] <+oOZtkOo> she always uses lb if its up
[3:50:39] <Jflaskd13> Anyone concerned Hood Guy is gonna suck all the evil or some nefarious shit?
[3:50:40] <+Lost_Zombie> You can't out limit breack Alisae
[3:50:41] <bestwaifuritsu> Alisae is programmed to use it immediately because she wants to show off
[3:50:41] <%yeknomlive> the music :<
[3:50:42] <BunnyEmperor> Its dumb lmao
[3:50:45] <+Estuko> monkaS monkaS
[3:50:50] <TioXyco> y u no wait the Protect cast? LUL
[3:50:51] <Bluewolf544> monkaS

[3:50:58] <%ovan20> monkaS
[3:51:08] <$SleepyMaribo> @InugamiTheHound hes playing with npcs
[3:51:13] <%THATGUY_789> look out. it's a Cum Bear
[3:51:16] <%Shadicara> Time for that big tank damage PogChamp
[3:51:25] <Samus37> Forgiven Conceit is radical
[3:51:27] <%THATGUY_789> Cummy Bear is better
[3:51:27] <Bluewolf544> Would pat turn into a mindgoblin then
[3:51:46] <BunnyEmperor> The tank AI is pretty good, turning enemies away from the party
[3:51:55] <%Shadicara> The fact the aoes don't cost anything is actually vile
[3:51:56] <TioXyco> how does it feel, pat? to spam AoE?
[3:52:00] <InugamiTheHound> where is pat's stand?
[3:52:08] <$SleepyMaribo> im lvl 73 now, the new aoe is pretty dope
[3:52:12] <%ArcanumMBD> the new drk aoe looks amazing
[3:52:14] <notquitedead123> Was that Bianco Angelo?
[3:52:19] <%THATGUY_789> I'm drunk
[3:52:20] <BunnyEmperor> Stand is the lvl 80 skill
[3:52:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Did Patron get his stand yet?
[3:52:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's gonna wipe
[3:52:40] <%yeknomlive> i can see allisae eyeing that lb
[3:52:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> stand is at level 80
[3:52:44] <neroblind88> SCORPIANS monkaS
[3:52:44] <MasterDecoder> @Bluewolf544 an angel-esque porcelain goblin is a creepy thought
[3:52:49] <%Shadicara> The only way this npc party can wipe now is if pat fucks up Kappa
[3:52:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> isn't it
[3:52:54] <TioXyco> Scumpions
[3:52:59] <%Valdorick> They ran outta the AoE!
[3:53:11] <%Valdorick> They're better than 95% of BLMs!
[3:53:14] <%yeknomlive> alphinaud LUL
[3:53:20] <%Shadicara> I wanna know if items drop the same in the npc dungeons
[3:53:20] <+oOZtkOo> alphi ate that aoe
[3:53:28] <$SleepyMaribo> Alphy ran out of one aoe into another lol
[3:53:30] <ShichiNoBushi> They should have made it so you can name your summons so Patron's Living Shadow could be Crazy Talk.
[3:53:31] <%yeknomlive> he's like fuck it im the healer
[3:53:32] <%THATGUY_789> how good is only to rely on oneself
[3:53:40] <+Lost_Zombie> Did this with the trust system my first time and it was faster and safer than doing it with actual people
[3:53:42] <$AdamElJefe> It's the fucking polar bear from Lost!!
[3:53:50] <worldbrand> da bears
[3:53:52] <+trainflip> you get fewer drops in trusts
[3:53:53] <%Valdorick> Shit Tank
[3:53:57] <+Estuko> Alph: WutFace
[3:54:02] <%THATGUY_789> or his Dark Materials
[3:54:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> trust system is dungeon easy mode right
[3:54:32] <%yeknomlive> easy mode? not really. it's probably easier with people
[3:54:41] <%Shadicara> I think it's just an alternative to massive queues
[3:54:43] <neroblind88> GOAT MMO RarePepe
[3:54:44] <%Mekhet09> depends on the people
[3:54:44] <bestwaifuritsu> its mechanic learning mode with way less exp
[3:54:52] <ShichiNoBushi> It still requires some participation from the player.
[3:55:13] <+Raidou24> Its faster with people for sure
[3:55:18] <%Mekhet09> i think the exp is the same.
[3:55:24] <RavenHellkite> the exp is the same
[3:55:24] <+trainflip> its the same exp isn't it? just way slower?
[3:55:30] <Brodius> Is this a Story Quest?
[3:55:39] <+ShudMirelurk> monkaS 🦂
[3:55:41] <%Shadicara> It's a welcome alternative from me. Give me this in stormblood BabyRage
[3:55:43] <%yeknomlive> @Brodius required dungeons but yeah
[3:55:44] <%demegodz> those clowns had some nice "burst windows" too if you k ow what I menan
[3:55:47] <%Mekhet09> the drops are slower. then again if pat pulled harder it'd be faster.
[3:56:08] <+Raidou24> NPCs can't handle big pulls
[3:56:10] <KatabolicRage> I can confirm that trust is slower, the AI tank will always do slow pulls, the dps do less AOE's than they should as far I can tell
[3:56:20] <+trainflip> alisaie uses the LB every chance she gets
[3:56:21] <%THATGUY_789> man having an AoE with no MP loss is great
[3:56:27] <Helghast102> don't be a coward
[3:56:32] <ShichiNoBushi> The Computer characters fight every group of enemies individually rather than aggroing a large number and handling them at once.
[3:56:42] <Helghast102> fair
[3:56:43] <%Mekhet09> damn.
[3:56:53] <+axenred> tell your teammates to get good
[3:56:57] <7th_justiceflame> Dude I love that your still playing. I saw you playing this morning
[3:56:57] <Bluewolf544> balls exposed
[3:57:03] <KatabolicRage> They're competant but players are better unless they're absolutely useless
[3:57:03] <%myrrdraal1515> @AngriestPat Doing this as a DPS was painful, anything more than the minimum pull would wipe the party
[3:57:05] <%THATGUY_789> Trust Adjust
[3:57:09] <+axenred> Cutscene-Kun!
[3:57:11] <%madogod> finally

[4:01:19] <$SleepyMaribo> which means the next dungeon will have either 400 gear or higher
[4:01:19] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin

[4:02:07] <%Mekhet09> 73-75 seems like it's just be the start of 400
[4:02:21] <%Lapinelis> 72 quests give 395 stuff
[4:02:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> I am Thou, Thou art I From the sea of thy soul, I come...Switch Grimlin

[4:03:27] <+axenred> nah man thats just a pissed off cow
[4:03:31] <Furretposting2> sheep
[4:03:33] <%Roundelay11> Trust dungeons are absolutely the best resource to practice tanking now
[4:03:34] <+axenred> needs milking

[4:03:39] <Brodius> Corgi Light Eater

[4:03:40] <%Shadicara> sheep LUL
[4:03:43] <+Riseskimo> good morning everyone
[4:03:48] <KatabolicRage> all living things they get their hands on becomes one of them, this is a horrific apocalyptic situation for a reason
[4:03:51] <Foggysheep> not the sheep D:
[4:03:53] <neroblind88> sky bison
[4:03:57] <+valkuma> its a sky bison
[4:04:02] <%crowsloft77> the Holy cow
[4:04:04] <%Lapinelis> Problem is, you need to get to 70 to get the chance to try out said tanking :p
[4:04:09] <BunnyEmperor> The final boss is a hollow from Bleach LUL
[4:04:10] <parkslady> Appa PogChamp
[4:04:11] <%THATGUY_789> cloud Bison
[4:04:14] <InugamiTheHound> is that a ram or bison?
[4:04:19] <ferropenic> I've gotten agro so many times still because of tanks not doing aoe

[4:04:48] <Brodius> "Local Black Man kills entire White Population"
[4:04:49] <%yeknomlive> yeah. you have to pay attention to the set up
[4:04:52] <%Fatmanjoggin> It feels like bardams 2
[4:04:54] <%Ninestempest> Isn't that just becuase you're doing this with a Trust?
[4:04:59] <%yeknomlive> like with the orbs from that last boss
[4:05:01] <Foggysheep> baba is sin
[4:05:04] <%Lapinelis> Pat, why are you slaughtering some farmers shit?
[4:05:19] <%Roundelay11> Yeah, they don't
[4:05:21] <+valkuma> that would make big pulls impossible
[4:05:22] <%THATGUY_789> @brodius apatHoldon
[4:05:23] <%crowsloft77> I've actually had harder times running it with people than trust
[4:05:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Well that's because people are stupid
[4:05:41] <bestwaifuritsu> its not that its evil, its that its too GOOD
[4:05:43] <+justianxix> you mean good now

[4:06:23] <haveswordmuststing> dont tell him Kappa
[4:06:26] <%Shadicara> On a farm too like old yella LUL
[4:06:28] <%THATGUY_789> not even the last boss?
[4:06:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> A11S
[4:06:48] <neroblind88> 3 DOTS
[4:06:49] <BunnyEmperor> This is the order of attacks ez
[4:06:49] <+Estuko> monkaS
[4:06:53] <TsundereFFXIV> someone never did O12S Kappa
[4:06:56] <Helghast102> pat confirmed to never do A11S
[4:07:00] <+Ell1ot> i took a nap. did someone feed that poison peach to the kid yet?
[4:07:06] <Furretposting2> that mechanic feels like its setting up something for a later fight tbh
[4:07:09] <Jack_Nightshadow> What's the matter Pat? Never did A11S or O12S?
[4:07:13] <%crowsloft77> @ell1ot Kid never ate it
[4:07:21] <MasterDecoder> R.I.P. Tesleen pikalyScared alyekCry
[4:07:24] <$SleepyMaribo> look at them stack up!
[4:07:27] <%crowsloft77> yet...
[4:07:30] <+Solshine11> Someone skipped some savage content tieGeop
[4:07:48] <%yeknomlive> are you supposed to do something specific with the pounce?
[4:07:53] <+oOZtkOo> alisae pls
[4:07:54] <%Valdorick> They stack AND spread! Its the Perfect party... now they just gotta remove you from it.
[4:08:02] <+Riseskimo> So Pat, did you play PLD yet and which of the two do you find more fun
[4:08:35] <%Lapinelis> Apparently GUN is a bit broken, as in broken good, atm :o
[4:08:39] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder who'd be tagging along as the tank if you were doing healer/DPS
[4:08:49] <bestwaifuritsu> they removed protect from healers and gave it to GUN LUL
[4:08:49] <BunnyEmperor> hmm white stuff on the floor... intriguing
[4:08:55] <%GarbageNirvana> I also wonder if I'd have the answer to these questions had I been paying more attention earlier in the stream
[4:09:00] <%GarbageNirvana> But I don't wanna spoil myself too much
[4:09:16] <+Jajanken4> @bestwaifuritsu they took away protect from healers wtf?
[4:09:19] <$Dakuu75> @bestwaifuritsu that's literal blaspheme
[4:09:19] <+Lost_Zombie> @GarbageNirvana The Exarch will tank for you then. Or fill any other roll you're not in if he's in the party
[4:09:21] <%ovan20> the first boss was so much cooler!
[4:09:22] <BunnyEmperor> @GarbageNirvana the crystal dude
[4:09:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Huh.
[4:09:34] <%GarbageNirvana> He didn't seem the tanky type
[4:09:41] <%Shadicara> Poof
[4:09:42] <$monkeyhous3> Rip
[4:09:44] <BunnyEmperor> @GarbageNirvana he tanked for me when I went as SAM
[4:09:45] <%yeknomlive> allisae BibleThump
[4:09:45] <+Edrem> awh alisaie comments on it
[4:09:46] <+Lost_Zombie> He goes full paladin tank
[4:09:47] <bestwaifuritsu> yeah Protect is gone forever, gunbreaker has a shield skill for itself and can put a shield on another party member
[4:09:47] <Fonarios> BibleThump
[4:09:57] <Brodius> Kill Woman; Got Trousers
[4:10:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Interesting
[4:10:04] <%madogod> F
[4:10:04] <Ashecroft> Is this a Trust system dungeon?
[4:10:05] <+Estuko> OH SHIT
[4:10:05] <Helghast102> it's so much better than sirensong sea
[4:10:06] <%Lapinelis> The first boss is a more difficult fight, the second boss hits you in the feels @ovan20
[4:10:07] <$SleepyMaribo> wow just like that!
[4:10:08] <BunnyEmperor> Instant F
[4:10:08] <+Estuko> They got ROCKED
[4:10:12] <+Jajanken4> wow that is awful @bestwaifuritsu
[4:10:12] <neroblind88> monkaS
[4:10:13] <+Estuko> monkaS monkaS
[4:10:16] <%Shadicara> Yeah you actually get to look at the dungeon using the trust LUL
[4:10:35] <Applecannon63> sineaters look sexy
[4:10:39] <redrins> is this the one with the boss from the benchmark?
[4:10:48] <%yeknomlive> so was that dragon a farm animal too?
[4:10:50] <$Dakuu75> there's 3 things whm should ALWAYS have. Protect, Cure and Esuna.
[4:10:52] <+Estuko> @Applecannon63 the female body ones look amazing, reminds me the JOY angels from Bayonetta
[4:11:03] <%GarbageNirvana> So when do you get to summon Madama Butterfly
[4:11:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> BIG FIGHTS
[4:11:36] <BunnyEmperor> Afaik you cant pull them all, they spawn in order
[4:11:45] <BunnyEmperor> At least I couldnt force pull them
[4:11:47] <%Shadicara> That's the space for the rest of the dungeon to go into Kappa
[4:11:57] <%Roundelay11> goddaman, you can spam the absolute shit out of unleash now
[4:12:04] <NJigglypuff> this room is for big dance parties
[4:12:10] <bestwaifuritsu> it doesnt cost anything to use now, free 99
[4:12:12] <baronvonkame> hell yea I came in at just the time I wanted
[4:12:19] <%Lapinelis> I mean, they don't AoE
[4:12:25] <KatabolicRage> well they don't aoe worth a shit so a big pull wouldn't make it faster anyways
[4:12:27] <%Lapinelis> Would you want to pull the entire room if they don't AoE
[4:12:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Forgiven Cowardice is such a japanese name
[4:12:33] <$SleepyMaribo> is true that if you die once during a trust instance you have ot do the entire dungeon over?
[4:12:33] <%yeknomlive> it's impossible to pull off unless you just stop
[4:12:48] <bestwaifuritsu> @sonofthedeepsouth its an appropriate name since they were the people running away
[4:12:52] <Jack_Nightshadow> Soul Eater didn't heal that much before.
[4:13:19] <baronvonkame> is this his first run of this or is he spamming it for levels?
[4:13:19] <%Nobrev> I keep seeing people say that keeping aggro is hard now because the aoe moves don't generate aggro on their own anymore and I feel like those people are still actively not staying in tank stance
[4:13:26] <Applecannon63> whats better sorry escape?
[4:13:29] <%Shadicara> Everything got big
[4:13:32] <ferropenic> Soul eater has 300 cure potency
[4:13:49] <%Shadicara> That's a lie
[4:13:53] <%Lapinelis> It depends, I've stolen aggro from a few tanks in fights
[4:13:53] <+SlowLikeThunder> That makes no sense, tank stance is redic now
[4:14:02] <BunnyEmperor> Tank stance guarantees aggro, its basically impossible to lose it if you have it on and just keep attacking
[4:14:07] <%Shadicara> It's brain dead to keep aggro now
[4:14:07] <%Fatmanjoggin> Tank stance is just free aggro now
[4:14:08] <+SlowLikeThunder> emnity fighting is basiocally nonexisten if you turn on tank stancer
[4:14:10] <ExpressNode> Wow Pat's still playing. Took a nap and everything
[4:14:20] <%Rafferty3231> Rafferty3231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Half a year, goddam. Thanks for the laughs,ya magnificent ginger bastard
[4:14:21] <%THATGUY_789> yeah. from what I see Pat never looses Agro
[4:14:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I do like how the gauge there is basically just fantasy Batman
[4:14:27] <+SlowLikeThunder> nobody can build near enough to outpace you unless you're like just focusing doen one in a mob
[4:14:32] <%Roundelay11> How much longer you gonna go?
[4:14:34] <neroblind88> its a drug monkaS
[4:14:36] <KnightCrawlers> @AngriestPat As a summoner for Aoe pulls. I have to give it like 4 GCD's before I start my Aoe. OR else I pull Aggro all the time 90% of the tim
[4:14:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ether I had a twin or Pat is psychic
[4:14:50] <+Zepshire> if you have trouble tanking with tank stance on that is a big oof
[4:14:58] <BunnyEmperor> Problem I've seen is Tanks not picking up all the monsters properly (or adds in a certain trial) and then the DPS get killed because they cant lower aggro themselves
[4:15:03] <%Michael_Erazo> Woolie has absolutely no interest in XIV?
[4:15:04] <+Ell1ot> i'm a little upset that the kid didn't eat the magic death peach
[4:15:13] <%Shadicara> Drops are fine though Kappa
[4:15:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Woolie doesn't seem like an MMO guy
[4:15:28] <Applecannon63> Yooo that Carbuncle
[4:15:29] <%Lapinelis> The set looks cool from this imo
[4:15:32] <+SlowLikeThunder> the lakeland tank set looks GOAT
[4:15:35] <%Roundelay11> MMO's are woolie poison
[4:15:36] <CrypticMochi> Now I have to wonder is any of those healer complaints have any validity
[4:15:49] <Commander_Spyke> WutFace

[4:20:38] <+BigBoy3535> @angriestpat just so you know, you and Woolie always talk about the idea that you dije if it’s a different you (not the same consciousness), but that’s a really contentious issue in modern philosophy. I took a class by the guy who literally wrote the book on death and it’s not as straightforward as you think it is.

[4:30:43] <%madogod> the Darkness is a good game
[4:30:45] <%Shadicara> You're an evil Prototype man now pat
[4:30:47] <+SlowLikeThunder> My guess is legitimately that it's some kind of weird time fuckery alphinaud just because their voices sound kinda simmilar
[4:30:48] <%MysteryFaceX> If it's Alphinaud, he would love smooches from the WoL.
[4:30:48] <Maverick2736> my warriors of dankness
[4:30:49] <%madogod> ahhh the light! it burns
[4:30:56] <%Typhaeon> The Crystarium now has a nighttime theme, by the way
[4:30:56] <%Faustgesicht> I'll pull off your pants if you pull off your hood
[4:30:57] <$psydaku> I miss Alphi's old VA
[4:30:58] <$monkeyhous3> the darkness grows
[4:30:58] <Brodius> Why is everything purple?
[4:31:01] <+zaworldo> the biggest and grosest of smooches
[4:31:01] <+Tokanova> REAL day light?!
[4:31:06] <InugamiTheHound> @madogod yeah I love the darkness and the darkness 2.
[4:31:10] <%mrshazboto> So wait can no one else see the blue sky but people who finished the quest? THAT'S RAD
[4:31:18] <Applecannon63> its Sparda's purple energy
[4:31:18] <%Maids4lyfe> yep
[4:31:20] <dredshift> It's secretly Exdeath and this is all a ploy to summon the VOID
[4:31:21] <%MysteryFaceX> I love the VA for HW onwards.
[4:31:48] <%Valdorick> Wait, but these are also TREES that have never known the true light of day, nor rest of night... THOSE TREES AND CROPS ARE FUCKED, YOU'VE DOOMED THE WORLD ANYWAY!
[4:31:50] <InugamiTheHound> where's the lion dude at?
[4:31:58] <%ryome> Would Peach a crystal man? We know Pat would, he would be clean and shiny
[4:32:00] <%Shadicara> Pat's character ate him like the boss Kappa
[4:32:00] <Brodius> They're magic trees
[4:32:15] <%Fatmanjoggin> Man, field boss weather conditions in this expansion are gonna be rad
[4:32:16] <Brodius> The Warrior of GUN
[4:32:19] <%Lapinelis> @mrshazboto There's a "skywatcher npc" when you just get to the world, all areas just say "blinding light" as the weather
[4:32:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Valdorick MAGIC, damn you!
[4:32:20] <%mrshazboto> Half of me wants to stop spoiling myself, but I'm barely a quarter a way through the first MSQ series and I doubt I'll remember this by the time I actually get to shadowbringers content
[4:32:24] <%sshen> Hover over the weather next time you can
[4:32:30] <+zaworldo> Gunbreaker w h e n

[4:32:49] <%THATGUY_789> Bunbreaker When
[4:33:00] <%MysteryFaceX> Does that mean the WoL can only save this world flooded in Light, but not other worlds flooded by other elements?
[4:33:01] <KatabolicRage> he was VERY handsome
[4:33:06] <+VERDAXY> booo party with blackjacks and strippers

[4:34:13] <%dave323dave> Is this ska?
[4:34:20] <rosemon5001> @Bane_Kaikyo sinowSamurai sinowSteel
[4:34:21] <%mrshazboto> @Lapinelis That's fucking gnarly. If it wasn't for tennocon being next week and me needing to desperately grind ducats, I'd probably mainline the FF14 MSQ like cocaine
[4:34:22] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat YOU! You haven't heard of underrate!?
[4:34:26] <haveswordmuststing> its that mediocre game maker game right Kappa

[4:35:36] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Did you hear how terrible voice 7 is for viera?
[4:35:39] <+Solshine11> @angriestpat your hat is probably the only reason you passed for an artist earlier.

[4:36:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Why are Yams a measurement of distance?
[4:36:04] <Brodius> Is that a Purple Flaming Dog?!
[4:36:14] <KatabolicRage> artists are eccentric
[4:36:17] <Belutima> @angriestpat could you double check for me, if the text size can't be bigger for mobile. Can't really use my audio is why I am asking. And when checking other stream I honestly don't have that problem with it. Know it's selfish but just to make my mind rest in ease
[4:36:23] <KatabolicRage> some people mail their ears to prostitutes, some wear full plate armour and a hat
[4:36:45] <jackythefrost> Aethercurrents I would like if there werent so many of them
[4:36:46] <%heyitsbrian> that's a rad mount - what is it?
[4:36:49] <dredshift> The text size in XIV is fuck off small
[4:36:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> What if the land was purple???
[4:36:56] <+zaworldo> c h r i s t

[4:37:17] <%mrshazboto> Anyone else here play WF and just absolutely hate new Wukong? Maybe hate is a strong word but I just can't get into the groove of using him after the rework.
[4:37:23] <Jolnir> what headphones do you use?
[4:37:31] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat but Pat, what will you do about the white line?
[4:37:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fate Fans detected, initiate shaming sequence
[4:37:43] <Brodius> Big Party going on there

[4:37:52] <%Kiyosuki> the colors in this expansion are just stunning
[4:37:54] <californaya> does anyone know what this song is called? the guitar join?
[4:37:54] <%cvp5127> fate PogChamp
[4:37:57] <californaya> joint*
[4:38:10] <goatlord_> Does this game allow you to rotate your saves
[4:38:13] <+buttdirt> that's some dope music
[4:38:16] <%Kiyosuki> its like they knew how much everyone was sick of all the drab desert colors from the last expansion
[4:38:23] <%mrshazboto> What's that fuckin RWBY music?
[4:38:26] <%luftraumm1> wasn't it east?
[4:38:28] <+Estuko> @mrshazboto I play, I think he's neat with the double person ability. But I haven't gotten him yet.
[4:38:37] <Belutima> then I guess it must be because of the 4K size I probably can't read it all that well. Thanks for checking tho.
[4:38:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Who's your bestgirl/guy in FF in general?
[4:38:43] <Brodius> You can rotate Servers
[4:38:44] <KaseKaizer> no save rotation stripREE
[4:38:46] <+valkuma> how many potions do you have saved up in your inventory for the big boss fight ?
[4:39:08] <haveswordmuststing> does this game run on vancient spell casting
[4:39:13] <%madogod> man the mount is going at the speed of light
[4:39:17] <%mrshazboto> You can save character design data so...technically you CAN rotate saves?
[4:39:24] <+FruitlessEndeavor> Pat, you can scale Dialogue windows independently of your global UI Scale. Right click on a dialogue window and you can make it big huge
[4:39:25] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Looks like that one place from Sekiro
[4:39:30] <%Lapinelis> Protip: Don't do anythying now, you'll unlock all the plus sidequests and shit in like two msq quests
[4:39:38] <haveswordmuststing> how many instgram filters does it have
[4:39:48] <%sshen> That gemstone trader sells mount speed increase after beating 6 fates

[4:49:45] <%Lapinelis> God LBs charge so slowly now :<
[4:49:47] <%Typhaeon> Nevermind she's single-targeting
[4:49:49] <%Nobrev> healer ADJUST
[4:49:54] <%sshen> Ultros has about 4-5 party finders up with everyone selling queues with healers
[4:49:55] <$AdamElJefe> Wow Tankalicious!
[4:50:00] <$SleepyMaribo> omg my game keeps crashing!
[4:50:13] <%THATGUY_789> Dealer Adjust
[4:50:19] <+Tokanova> i'm maining scholar this expac just to help my FC
[4:50:21] <+Tokanova> uwu
[4:50:24] <BunnyEmperor> I want DRK to cut a hole in the sky and have the darkness ooze out of it like in the trailer bleeeeurgh
[4:50:25] <%sshen> It#s FREE MONEY
[4:50:26] <KatabolicRage> tanks just can't handle having queues, as a lifelong dps main it's HILAIRIOUS
[4:51:01] <KatabolicRage> dps queues currently at sub-5 minutes for everything pat
[4:51:05] <%Valdorick> The Tanks and DPS should join forces, to eat the rich - I mean Healers
[4:51:05] <%Kiyosuki> yeah I have to admit it is pretty funny
[4:51:07] <%Lapinelis> DPS Queues are the reason why my fisher is 70.
[4:51:07] <%solomonpun> are the healer changes as bad as people are making it out to be?
[4:51:19] <%THATGUY_789> n
[4:51:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shadowbringers seems like the devs gave DNK even more reason to be the favorite
[4:51:22] <%Kiyosuki> I'm sorry but its much needed revenge for what happened in Stormblood
[4:51:23] <%THATGUY_789> na
[4:51:30] <%Kiyosuki> full petty
[4:51:30] <Brodius> Remtach
[4:51:44] <%THATGUY_789> yr just regulated to heals and no dps skills
[4:51:45] <Furretposting2> @solomonpun i think ast got shitted up but the other two seem fine
[4:51:49] <jackythefrost> Tank queues arent that bad rn
[4:51:52] <BunnyEmperor> LULW first timers
[4:51:57] <+Binary_Fireball> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[4:52:02] <jackythefrost> DPS queues are still much MUCH worse
[4:52:10] <%THATGUY_789> just stand there and heal
[4:52:11] <%Valdorick> No first time bonus - just BADS!....
[4:52:14] <%Valdorick> <--- Toxic
[4:52:20] <%spiritofmojave> alliance tank quenue is REALLY bad tho
[4:52:29] <Brodius> These bosses are really cool
[4:52:30] <%THATGUY_789> I bet
[4:52:35] <KishinGrek> Huh telegraphed attack areas?
[4:52:41] <%Maids4lyfe> killing angels that look like greek statues, feels like bayonetta
[4:52:59] <%mrshazboto> The fuck is this DDR shit
[4:53:05] <%Fenrirlives> okay my computer crashed, what'd I miss?
[4:53:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Maids4lyfe If there isn't a sequence with a Fly Me to the Moon cover, I will be very sad
[4:53:19] <Brodius> Pat's running the dungeon again
[4:53:19] <+Estuko> @mrshazboto DDR I can never do again, I can never forget my shame trying to show off lol
[4:53:20] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:53:20] <%Lapinelis> @Fenrirlives Feels
[4:53:23] <%THATGUY_789> You Bitch
[4:53:26] <%king_wragles> @Fenrirlives Pat fought a bear
[4:53:28] <%VioletHeart> What''s this? A party without a Dancer *or* a Gunbreaker?
[4:53:35] <%spiritofmojave> This some Drakengard 3 ending shit
[4:53:51] <bestwaifuritsu> loldrg
[4:53:51] <Kaede_Viz> lolDRG
[4:53:53] <%demegodz> F
[4:53:54] <Brodius> F
[4:53:54] <%Billyfig1> F Xiris
[4:53:57] <%Typhaeon> You have a jump Xiris
[4:53:58] <%wolfofsound> F
[4:53:58] <%mrshazboto> My brain legitimately couldn't handle this
[4:54:03] <%Nobrev> rip xiris
[4:54:10] <jackythefrost> @VioletHeart No one has then even up to 70 yet lol
[4:54:18] <Kaede_Viz> pop the tank LB pat
[4:54:23] <%THATGUY_789> I feel guilty every time dps die so I use swiftcast to revive
[4:54:41] <KatabolicRage> feeling guilty about a dps eating shit is something that will pass as a healer
[4:54:41] <%demegodz> he commited
[4:54:42] <%THATGUY_789> at least I don't have to rely on recasting protec on revive
[4:54:44] <ScrapSentinel> streamer luck
[4:54:46] <%VioletHeart> @jackythefrost I've *seen* lv70 gunbreakers. They already exist.
[4:54:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> D4: Dark DPS Don't Die
[4:55:00] <%Maids4lyfe> angel goats
[4:55:01] <Brodius> Evil Farm
[4:55:03] <%Gogogolem> This place drops a cool sword.
[4:55:04] <%xemnahort> I feel angry every time dps die so I swiftcast revive them to show them my displeasure quickly
[4:55:04] <artoflec> the enemy design is really damn cool
[4:55:08] <%Kiyosuki> oh my friend was a lvl 70 gunbreaker like 7 hours ago
[4:55:15] <%Kiyosuki> Just HoH all night
[4:55:15] <jackythefrost> Oh yea the level skips are already up too
[4:55:17] <+Scarlet12311> Hello!
[4:55:22] <ExpressNode> When did this expansion come out?
[4:55:27] <%Maids4lyfe> today
[4:55:27] <%Nobrev> I've been playing this since 5am non stop
[4:55:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> How is Gunbreaker?
[4:55:31] <%Gogogolem> I saw an lvl 80 gun breaker at noon today.
[4:55:41] <%THATGUY_789> @katabolicrage haha true. I'm starting to become cantankerous
[4:55:51] <%Lapinelis> 17 hrs ago @ExpressNode
[4:56:01] <%mrshazboto> This dungeon hard reminds me of Drakengard ending B
[4:56:07] <+Edrem> poor healer, having to spam benefic 2
[4:56:07] <jackythefrost> @GarbageQueenEllie Really good. It has the most complex rotation out of any of the tanks tho
[4:56:16] <Jolnir> NotLikeThis
[4:56:22] <+dammititsnate> How did I know he still be playing...
[4:56:23] <%THATGUY_789> @kiyosuki what? srsly
[4:56:28] <%Maids4lyfe> evil buffalo
[4:56:30] <%Typhaeon> Forgiven Disobedience, more like Forgiven Dzobedience
[4:56:37] <%Kiyosuki> yea
[4:56:40] <%Typhaeon> because it's a... dzo
[4:56:43] <%Fenrirlives> Aapa?
[4:56:44] <%THATGUY_789> @edrem hahaha
[4:56:49] <%Fenrirlives> yipyip?
[4:56:50] <%xemnahort> What lvl do dancer and gunbreaker start as?
[4:56:57] <Brodius> 60?
[4:56:57] <%Gogogolem> 60
[4:56:58] <%Lapinelis> 60, afaik
[4:57:14] <%xemnahort> And where do you get them?
[4:57:22] <bestwaifuritsu> gunbreaker in gridania
[4:57:30] <%Gogogolem> new girdia gb and limolosa dancer
[4:57:34] <%THATGUY_789> still tho. to get 20lvl on 10hrs is pretty extreme
[4:57:37] <artoflec> what does Greed mean? artofl1Hm
[4:57:51] <Brodius> They're enemies from Kamen Rider OOO
[4:57:52] <%MysteryFaceX> Rolling on everything
[4:57:55] <%sshen> DNC/GUN start at 60
[4:58:00] <%Lapinelis> @artoflec My current class can't equip this, but I want this anyway
[4:58:03] <%THATGUY_789> sorry 10lvs
[4:58:05] <%MoistMan7> hi birdman
[4:58:06] <artoflec> oh okay
[4:58:06] <%xemnahort> Thank goodness I can continue to procrastinate finishing heavensward to make more classes
[4:58:23] <%xemnahort> Did they change the mentor requirements?
[4:58:25] <jackythefrost> MSQ roulette is even more laughable now. Having level 70+ gear just melts everything
[4:58:30] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> need has a higher priority aswell,
[4:58:30] <%Wallofbricks> I have a greed for speed!
[4:58:32] <Brodius> Is Tom Holland still playing this?
[4:58:33] <%Valdorick> And Need take priority over Greed.
[4:58:37] <%THATGUY_789> @lapinelis ha
[4:58:59] <%mrshazboto> @Brodius I don't think he ever stopped
[4:59:01] <+sixcubit> this thing looks way less menacing then the previous boss in this raid
[4:59:20] <%Typhaeon> Fell Cleave my ass
[4:59:30] <%demegodz> Oh shit I just saw it's Tesleen, damn
[4:59:30] <%Lapinelis> I mean, there's legit reason to want the stuff even if you can't equip it. Disenchantment gear. Grand company seals
[4:59:32] <%Lapinelis> etc
[4:59:40] <jackythefrost> @sixcubit There's heavy story implications for this one
[4:59:45] <%Scarnehu> look at that DPS race
[4:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:54] <+StrawberryPantsu> GAMER CUBE
[5:00:03] <Brodius> F I V E H O U R S
[5:00:08] <%Valdorick> X to Doubt
[5:00:10] <%Typhaeon> The Gamer Triangle didn't work so well
[5:00:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Be sure to inhale some Dihydrogen Monoxide
[5:00:27] <+SlowLikeThunder> Guides aren't out yet so nobody knows what the mechanics actually are LUL
[5:00:31] <%Lapinelis> This boss is boring mechanically, but boy does it punch you in the feels
[5:00:41] <%MysteryFaceX> I wonder how Pat will find Paladin? I'm hoping they play differently enough.
[5:00:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageQueenEllie you can only consume dihydrogen monoxide to breath it is lethal in most cases
[5:00:55] <%damienlunas> who is Telseen
[5:01:02] <%THATGUY_789> @lapinelis true dat
[5:01:08] <%Typhaeon> Pretty pattern at least
[5:01:15] <%THATGUY_789> @damienlunas oh poor sweet child
[5:01:26] <+BoboDaHobo> yo, where's everybody at?
[5:01:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> @doc_ock_rokc But everyone who has drank it has died. Coincidence? I think not!
[5:01:31] <MESeele> !uptime
[5:01:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 1m.
[5:01:37] <Aussie_Manny> Is using a controller the better way to play this game?
[5:01:44] <+Estuko> ONLY 5 hours??? It felt like 8
[5:01:45] <jackythefrost> Yes it is
[5:01:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> No it's not
[5:02:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> (It's personal preference)
[5:02:12] <%MysteryFaceX> @Etsuko He resetted his pc at one point
[5:02:13] <%madogod> @Estuko there was like an hour or two of pat trying to log in when DDOS was happening
[5:02:17] <%Typhaeon> Time for some crazy shit
[5:02:21] <%xemnahort> @aussie_manny honestly it comes down to comfort I find it preferable personally but it does have less buttons
[5:02:21] <+Estuko> Oh god I forgt about that @madogod @MysteryFaceX
[5:02:29] <%Typhaeon> Oh, Leroy Jenkins moment denied
[5:02:41] <%Lapinelis> I assume it's due to the trust feature
[5:02:46] <%Lapinelis> Limiting max pulls
[5:02:47] <Aussie_Manny> @xemnahort Is having less buttons a big detriment?
[5:03:03] <+Estuko> @Aussie_Manny not at all, they have a way to make it absolutely work
[5:03:16] <%Lapinelis> @Aussie_Manny You have a lot of buttons on a controller
[5:03:28] <ScrapSentinel> Controller vs. Keyboard is a matter of dexterity and preference
[5:03:34] <%luftraumm1> why so much unleash?
[5:03:35] <%THATGUY_789> @aussie_manny yeah up to you to choose. I have small sausage fingers and can use controller easier. FF14 is very good at customisation
[5:03:52] <%Maids4lyfe> FF14 is optimized for controller and keyboard fairly well
[5:03:59] <Aussie_Manny> Naruhodo, naruhodo... 🤔
[5:04:04] <%THATGUY_789> @maids4lyfe truth
[5:04:04] <%Lapinelis> I've played both controller and mouse and keyboard. Either is fine
[5:04:05] <%xemnahort> @aussie_manny not really I mean I still have full access to 5 hotbars at any given time which is more than enough for every class I’ve played but some like to have more
[5:04:23] <%luftraumm1> also there's the question of ergonomics, or wrist pain avoidance
[5:04:30] <%xemnahort> @aussie_manny sorry 6 hotbars
[5:04:33] <%THATGUY_789> @luftraumm1 agreed
[5:04:40] <%Maids4lyfe> I have carpal tunnel, so a controller is better for me
[5:05:05] <+Estuko> @Maids4lyfe my arm is still healing so controller is a big + for not having to move my wrist/arm a lot
[5:05:15] <%xemnahort> I play on ps4 so controller is ideal but I do use a keyboard to type
[5:05:18] <%Lapinelis> I really like the last boss of this, but it doesn't like BLMs
[5:05:21] <ScrapSentinel> I went through this using Trust, holy shit Tank NPCs eat dirt super hard
[5:05:36] <%Maids4lyfe> having a keyboard to type is definitely a good thing
[5:05:41] <%Nobrev> I play on ps4 but I use a keyboard and an mmo mouse
[5:05:41] <ScrapSentinel> healing in a Trust is super intense
[5:05:43] <%luftraumm1> keyboard for typing is very useful tho
[5:05:44] <%yeknomlive> how to you open the trust menu?
[5:05:51] <%Mekhet09> Why no low blow use?
[5:06:05] <%luftraumm1> "typing" on controller is very sad
[5:06:08] <+Estuko> <huff> <huff>
[5:06:13] <jackythefrost> @yeknomlive You unlock it after the first ShB dungeon
[5:06:15] <%xemnahort> Has the trust system helped the queues a lot so far?
[5:06:20] <Aussie_Manny> Well, I used to play DC Universe Online, and in that you macro'd abilities to R2/L2 + a face button. Effectively EIGHT different buttons.
[5:06:22] <+Estuko> that dude up there is BOOKING it
[5:06:33] <%THATGUY_789> @luftraumm1 yes. I play PC and use PS4 con and find it's a great combo. I have terrible wrists
[5:06:45] <%Mekhet09> Oh god. I got kicked out while loading to an area and now the queue is at 1814.
[5:06:45] <%Maids4lyfe> that's one ugly ass angel
[5:06:46] <Furretposting2> this may be my favorite non primal boss theme in the game
[5:06:54] <ScrapSentinel> RUINED LUL
[5:07:00] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[5:07:12] <+Estuko> @Aussie_Manny SAME on ps3-ps4 I played DCUO till... I couldn't because pay wall for me lol
[5:07:23] <%THATGUY_789> @mekhet09 WOW
[5:07:26] <%luftraumm1> @thatguy_789 I use xbox pro, feels better in my hands, but dual shock is great too
[5:07:43] <%THATGUY_789> @luftraumm1 yeah I want one of those
[5:07:45] <Aussie_Manny> Pay walls are the devil's membrane, and money is his blood.
[5:07:45] <%mrshazboto> So if I understand right. Dark Knight just builds up gauge and spams Fell Cleave
[5:08:01] <%king_wragles> I feel like current gen console controllers are just generally good
[5:08:21] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> apatBig apatDab
[5:08:27] <%Mekhet09> I feel sorry for the astrologian what a boring class to play now.
[5:08:35] <%Mekhet09> All the complexity got gutted.
[5:08:36] <+Estuko> @Aussie_Manny I honestly had a lot of fun till I couldn't continue forward :'(
[5:08:42] <%luftraumm1> @thatguy_789 only small problem it's the clearance on the triggers is a bit on the large side, gotta pull them a bit far
[5:08:44] <+Jajanken4> @Mekhet09 what happened to it?
[5:08:47] <%THATGUY_789> @king_wragles yeah I'm surprised it took so long
[5:08:51] <%Mekhet09> All the cards became balance.
[5:08:52] <ScrapSentinel> yeah you just stare at cards and make sure the round peg goes into the right hole
[5:09:05] <%Mekhet09> It also lost a lot of unique interactions.
[5:09:11] <%THATGUY_789> @luftraumm1 ok cheers
[5:09:31] <%Lapinelis> Whelp, I'm going to bed, night pat
[5:09:36] <%MysteryFaceX> LB is ready. D:
[5:09:40] <KatabolicRage> nobody wanted anything but balance anyways
[5:09:42] <%damienlunas> Left Nut
[5:09:43] <%THATGUY_789> gnight
[5:09:50] <%Mekhet09> Not always.
[5:09:52] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat can barely hear paige D:
[5:09:54] <Scorchy_Worchy> gotta wait till 1% to use lb Kappa
[5:10:06] <%Mekhet09> There were a a few cards that also saw use.
[5:10:07] <Jeemukun> if he's still going in 3 hours that'll make a 12 hour stream
[5:10:09] <%mrshazboto> Alright. Time to let this play in the background while I go grind out as many ducats as i can in a weekend. Peace all <3
[5:10:12] <%luftraumm1> thus guy kinda reminds me of zurvan
[5:10:19] <%MoraMiarty> WE FAAAAALLLLL
[5:10:23] <%Ritty78> Ritty78 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:10:29] <Zer0beats> Kreygasm
[5:10:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> this guy has some muscle legs
[5:10:33] <Aussie_Manny> Is there a chance XIV will EVER be sold as a one-time payment like Guild Wars 2, not a subscription?
[5:10:34] <%THATGUY_789> GG well Done Team
[5:10:41] <RealPT1> music almost reminds me of nier
[5:10:43] <bestwaifuritsu> @Aussie_Manny not a chance
[5:10:47] <%madogod> WEEB
[5:10:55] <+TheImmortal70> @Aussie_Manny NO
[5:10:55] <%MoraMiarty> I spent all day playing from start of early access and only got to level 74
[5:10:59] <%MoraMiarty> fucking gunbreaker
[5:11:04] <%MoraMiarty> fucked my tank queues
[5:11:04] <%xemnahort> @aussie_manny honestly probably never that sort of thing needs to be there at the start
[5:11:05] <+TheImmortal70> @Aussie_Manny The game is probably in it's prime rn
[5:11:11] <%Typhaeon> This song is fucking gorgeous by the way
[5:11:24] <%Mekhet09> I only got to 72 but I'm in gilg and getting kicked out makes it impossible to get back in.
[5:11:34] <+TheImmortal70> All of the music in this so far kinda feel surreal for a FF game
[5:11:35] <%THATGUY_789> do Iiiit
[5:11:38] <%Mekhet09> And I've been kicked out like 3 times.
[5:11:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @aussie_manny maybe if they were under a hundred thousand subs? but that would mean a whole lotta drop off.
[5:11:44] <%demegodz> YEah dew it!
[5:11:48] <chronoxgp> bandai announced an online rpg called blue protocol
[5:11:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I love the music. I want to play but...I dont know how I feel about the sub thing and I'd be NEW NEW NEW

[5:13:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PAt should I buy this a new person? @AngriestPat
[5:13:24] <%Toast_Master_General> THRUST
[5:13:25] <%demegodz> Thrusting hu?
[5:13:38] <%Mekhet09> Lol you wish no healer.
[5:13:47] <+TheImmortal70> Raiden thrust is a sick move name
[5:13:50] <%luftraumm1> cysts are a bitch to heal
[5:13:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> you kinda look right now like you'd smell like warm lunch meat.
[5:13:59] <%wolfofsound> @GarbageQueenEllie yeah I need to go back on accutane or something, but I haven't been able to get an appointment the last few months due to my schedule and their's
[5:14:01] <%Ninestempest> QUALITY ENGLISH
[5:14:02] <%Mekhet09> Healer is the role no one wants this expac.
[5:14:09] <+TheImmortal70> That's a lie
[5:14:10] <%wolfofsound> @luftraumm1 no kidding man
[5:14:13] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat probably asking if this is a good time to get in the game
[5:14:14] <+TheImmortal70> WHM is awesome
[5:14:15] <Aussie_Manny> Buy the game a new human to play it.
[5:14:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat He is new to the game. Should he buy this game
[5:14:17] <ExpressNode> I think he means should he buy it as a new player
[5:14:17] <$Afterman_> new ffxiv player
[5:14:19] <$Afterman_> should he buy
[5:14:23] <%xemnahort> @mekhet09 so it’s my time to shine... again
[5:14:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @wolfofsound That's always a hassle. Best of luck to you
[5:14:24] <%Typhaeon> Damn, cut off right before the solo
[5:14:28] <%Mekhet09> No healers fucking suck.
[5:14:28] <%MoraMiarty> let me WAR reeeeeeeeeeeeee
[5:14:30] <Zombrocom> I would assume he meant should I buy this as a new player
[5:14:31] <%Mekhet09> To play.

[5:14:39] <%Billyfig1> No Tank, Only Kill
[5:14:40] <%MysteryFaceX> Pat, I think they're saying healers are boring now.
[5:14:41] <+TheImmortal70> Keep it
[5:14:42] <%Mekhet09> So does SCH.

[5:16:18] <+TheImmortal70> @xemnahort Nope
[5:16:19] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pick one :^)
[5:16:30] <%rytyoung> okay Bloodborne has just ripped me a new one in that ex machina area
[5:16:36] <+TheImmortal70> Queues are wonky because everyone is playing tanks and stuff rn
[5:16:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Well, Pat, seeing that every boss in this realm is a large white phallus, I guess they just ran out of resources to model your junk
[5:16:45] <+TheImmortal70> It'll equalize in a few days I think
[5:16:47] <%rytyoung> Bloodborne FFS bloodstained
[5:16:50] <+HyraFukit> Hows it going
[5:17:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pat finally knows how it feels to WAR as a DRK
[5:18:02] <+TheImmortal70> Does WAR get five aoes off inner release?
[5:18:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yes
[5:18:07] <%Mekhet09> Yess.
[5:18:12] <+TheImmortal70> Neat
[5:18:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or 5 single targets
[5:18:20] <%Mekhet09> It also gets 2 980 direct crit moves at 80.
[5:18:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> ^
[5:18:42] <%Mekhet09> Inner release is also better because it gives fell cleave direct hit and crit.
[5:18:43] <+StrawberryPantsu> GNB is great though
[5:18:47] <%Harawanagangsta> !uptime
[5:18:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 18m.
[5:18:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> Give it a spin in HoH
[5:19:05] <%luftraumm1> hmm did unleash get a buff?
[5:19:08] <+TheImmortal70> Four of those were crits
[5:19:13] <+TheImmortal70> Unleash now does 3x the damage
[5:19:27] <%spiritofmojave> Unleash got a substantial potency buff and free cost
[5:19:33] <%luftraumm1> jesus, that's why he's spamming it
[5:19:37] <+TheImmortal70> Mhm
[5:19:41] <%spiritofmojave> yep
[5:19:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> Oh
[5:19:55] <+TheImmortal70> You also will get stalwart soul at level 72 which does 10 more potenncy, gets you 20 blood, and restores mp
[5:20:05] <+TheImmortal70> So you're gonna be spamming Quietus' in your aoe rotation
[5:20:11] <%luftraumm1> sbfpYeyeye
[5:20:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> So Inner Release still is for sure crit every Fell Cleave?
[5:20:14] <%spiritofmojave> looking forward to that, oh my
[5:20:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, so does Forgiven dissonance mean that it's forgiven for being dissonant, or is it dissonant on forgiveness?
[5:21:02] <%Mekhet09> Now you go infuriate>Inner Chaos> Inner release> Fell Cleave x5> infuriate> Inner Chaos.
[5:21:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> Doing 5 bloodspillers in a row looks goofy
[5:21:16] <+TheImmortal70> It is a dissonance that is forgiven
[5:21:19] <rufus2k2> Try spinning!
[5:21:21] <%MysteryFaceX> Can those be Interrupted?
[5:21:26] <+Kang_Artur> is he fighting an angle?
[5:21:28] <+TheImmortal70> Probably not
[5:21:36] <+TheImmortal70> The interruptible moves flash
[5:21:45] <sirrice77> @Kang_Artur is it an angle or a devil
[5:21:45] <%MoraMiarty> they really want you to do the fates
[5:21:48] <%luftraumm1> maybe yuor devil
[5:21:50] <%Mekhet09> You should do duty finder.
[5:21:59] <+Kang_Artur> @sirrice77 moon2H
[5:22:01] <+TheImmortal70> There's supposed to be more dungeons this time
[5:22:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wow, these farms got rekt
[5:22:10] <rufus2k2> these things look like Bayonetta should grind her heels into their faces
[5:22:11] <%MysteryFaceX> Flash? You mean the gauge that fills up flashes?
[5:22:14] <+TheImmortal70> So I'm supposing you're gonna be getting less exp per, but doing more variety
[5:23:14] <rufus2k2> Why is Appa here

[5:24:02] <rufus2k2> that's one heckuva name
[5:24:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> Why is Dr.EggMan playing FFXIV :^)
[5:24:11] <%luftraumm1> combover
[5:24:15] <%mrshazboto> Shaving his head is the closest pat can get to becomming a skeleton for PAige
[5:24:15] <shotgang86> Pat looks 10 years Younger and older at the same time
[5:24:21] <%Mekhet09> Combovers are awful.
[5:24:21] <EVA_Unit02> Pat is a pretender to the Egg throne
[5:24:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Even got his boss cruiser and everything
[5:24:29] <shotgang86> How is that possible

[5:25:20] <%kujofire990> back in there for 22months, just got to HW
[5:25:25] <+poweruser> Do blood sacrifice
[5:25:40] <%luftraumm1> salted earth got you a lot of blood
[5:25:47] <%UltraViolet371> This game is so pretty
[5:25:54] <%kurensik> Whoa! He's still playing
[5:25:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Which came first, the Funny Hat or the Egg?

[5:26:28] <rufus2k2> egg built hat
[5:26:33] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[5:26:44] <ZaDoorman> it felt weird running this dungeon with trusts
[5:26:58] <%kujofire990> are trust decent tho?
[5:27:07] <%spiritofmojave> it's easier to manage but way slower imo
[5:27:13] <+TheImmortal70> Trusts function
[5:27:22] <+TheImmortal70> Which is more than some players
[5:27:25] <ZaDoorman> their passable
[5:27:27] <BunnyEmperor> EDGY DEATH BEAM
[5:27:30] <%luftraumm1> by what I saw of party doing it trusts are good to learn the dungeon
[5:27:32] <%kujofire990> but they are only for SHB right?
[5:27:38] <ZaDoorman> yeah
[5:27:39] <%MoraMiarty> trusts were balanced to complete a dungeon within a half hour
[5:27:45] <+TheImmortal70> SHB MS Dungeons
[5:27:47] <%king_wragles> How is gunner not a class yet?
[5:27:49] <+earthboy2k> the edge becomes sharper with each level
[5:27:51] <%king_wragles> Or sniper
[5:27:59] <+TheImmortal70> MCH is gunner
[5:28:02] <%Cardz_> ^
[5:28:02] <+crazzy294> Looking good With a haircut pat!
[5:28:05] <+TheImmortal70> It’s literally fun

[5:28:12] <%Cardz_> G u n
[5:28:13] <+cinder_chan> FunGun
[5:28:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> trust is only shb and I think only the msq dungeons
[5:28:17] <ZaDoorman> its both
[5:28:25] <%king_wragles> I thought mech was more summon robots to do your dps for you?
[5:28:27] <%UltraViolet371> Damn all the aoe's and magic are gorgeous. If this was ftp I'd have to have a sad talk with ESO...
[5:28:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @king_wragles Well, we have stripper class now. as well as some gun
[5:28:51] <+TheImmortal70> No it’s gun that can summon more gun mechs
[5:28:52] <%kujofire990> when r we getting Big Pimpin Class?
[5:29:00] <%Cardz_> Build more gun
[5:29:02] <ZaDoorman> just watch, Geomancer will be a DPS with a straight up JoJo stand.
[5:29:06] <+TheImmortal70> Big pimpin is dancer
[5:29:12] <+cinder_chan> MCH has 1 summon that's a turret and becomes a robot, but most of your attacks are just your gun, and a few are a new multi tool drill/crossbow thing
[5:29:14] <%spiritofmojave> it's a hotter looking unleash
[5:29:20] <%kujofire990> no thats big whoring,
[5:29:20] <+saltyputblug> lasers
[5:29:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> No I ain't bluffin'
[5:29:27] <%PanicSwytch> is this a dungeon?
[5:29:33] <%luftraumm1> need a new healer tho
[5:29:40] <+TheImmortal70> DRK can now spam that shit to annoy people
[5:29:41] <Maverick2736> this stuff be lookin' like that one scene with the mass-produced evas in Evangelion
[5:29:48] <%king_wragles> Wait, was it ranged or melee physical that was lacking in the game?
[5:29:57] <Thalchampz> dude i just did some roulettes, checked the party finder, healers are SELLING their services to cu with people up to 200k gil
[5:29:58] <+TheImmortal70> Ranged
[5:29:59] <%Cardz_> Ranged
[5:29:59] <%king_wragles> in a number of classes sort of way
[5:30:03] <ZaDoorman> there's only 3 healer jobs in the game.
[5:30:07] <+cinder_chan> is there a green mage in final fantasy? like a druid?
[5:30:09] <BappoSama> this music is wicked..
[5:30:10] <%king_wragles> okay, so why no archer class with sniper job?
[5:30:13] <+TheImmortal70> We only had mch and bard and mch sucked
[5:30:15] <%Cardz_> Bard
[5:30:21] <rufus2k2> so MCH is good now?
[5:30:22] <Thalchampz> queue*
[5:30:23] <%Cardz_> doot
[5:30:27] <Thalchampz> MCH is good now
[5:30:28] <%king_wragles> Bard is heals though
[5:30:28] <BunnyEmperor> I wonder what this orchestrion roll is called
[5:30:30] <+cinder_chan> mch is very good now
[5:30:32] <+TheImmortal70> MCH is now consistent
[5:30:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> As opposed to before, where all you could spam as DNK was edgy Linkin Park lyrics
[5:30:44] <%MoraMiarty> there is no traditional sniper job in final fantasy
[5:30:45] <%luftraumm1> bard is dps
[5:30:48] <+poweruser> pat a barld
[5:30:52] <+TheImmortal70> That’s hard
[5:30:52] <%MoraMiarty> and arfcher becomes bard
[5:30:52] <%Cardz_> Bard is my favorite healer
[5:30:54] <+TheImmortal70> Bard

[5:33:06] <BunnyEmperor> Great choice for a boss battle theme, enjoying it for every dungeon over and over. Really gets you pumped when the boss pulls his best attacks
[5:33:44] <TioXyco> Most Sin-eaters do, ZaDoorman
[5:33:45] <ZaDoorman> but overall, I think this is the best intro dungeon XIV has had.
[5:33:45] <%luftraumm1> @turtlesandtentacles he's just a smol boi enjoying his video game, it's very authentic and sweet
[5:33:47] <Koosahmii> I just realized that Philia vaguely reminds me of Seymour‘s mom from Final Fantasy 10
[5:33:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's awesome that there's a Dancer character that's literally a bunny girl. They knew

[5:37:16] <+BubbaRands> I can't tell what's man or cube anymore WutFace
[5:37:25] <%Maids4lyfe> the laser beams of darkness are cool af
[5:37:33] <ZaDoorman> SAM is good once you know that big numbers are god
[5:37:39] <%Dr_DangerPhD> from what pat has shown shadwbringers looks great, hope I can reach it by tomorrow or sunday
[5:37:43] <%spiritofmojave> freaking l a s e r s
[5:38:12] <%Ritty78> what class is pat playing?
[5:38:22] <Zombrocom> Edgelord
[5:38:25] <ZaDoorman> Dark Knight
[5:38:31] <%luftraumm1> dork
[5:38:32] <rufus2k2> Darkku Naito
[5:38:33] <%Ritty78> looks edgy and sick
[5:38:55] <+BubbaRands> *Batman TAS theme intensifies*
[5:38:56] <%Maids4lyfe> dark knight is fitting for a "warrior of darkness"
[5:39:17] <+TheImmortal70> Pats actually not casting edge or flood that often, so he could be doing more damage
[5:39:19] <ZaDoorman> that's why DRK is the expansions cover class
[5:40:03] <%Cardz_> Nice
[5:41:04] <%Maids4lyfe> god
[5:41:16] <%Maids4lyfe> just watching that angel come down in the god rays is so freakin' cool
[5:41:47] <%edgeyberzerker> these FFXIV streams are really chill and relaxing to watch
[5:42:53] <Cerabret100> so this boss is just avoid the fire tank and spank?
[5:43:39] <%Maids4lyfe> seems like it
[5:44:38] <%Mekhet09> You should really do fates pat.
[5:45:38] <+StrawberryPantsu> GET SMOKED

[5:46:10] <%Valdorick> !Toxic!

[5:49:51] <+TheImmortal70> How
[5:49:51] <%Mythicalbrit> skipping cutscenes apparently speeds u up INSANELY fast
[5:49:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> Healer Strike 2k19
[5:50:20] <+TheImmortal70> I can’t understand why they would do that
[5:50:27] <TraceBullet> skipping cutscenes in FFXIV? WutFace
[5:50:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> Neither can I :^)
[5:50:40] <+TheImmortal70> Skipping NEW cutscenes
[5:51:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> To avoid spoiling your stream
[5:51:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> That's what Happs is doing
[5:51:11] <%Maids4lyfe> what the heck is that thing
[5:51:21] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sineater
[5:51:25] <%Michael_Erazo> sure you hear this alot bit thanks for getting me into Final Fantasy XIV
[5:51:39] <%Maids4lyfe> it looks like grandma
[5:52:06] <%MoraMiarty> the first time I ever saw XIV gameplay was when pat played the launch of stormblood
[5:52:06] <%Maids4lyfe> apatPorgmo
[5:52:15] <%MoraMiarty> I thought "this shit looks stupid"
[5:52:17] <%Michael_Erazo> apatElmo
[5:52:30] <%MoraMiarty> years later having played through stormblood, stormblood is in fact stupid
[5:52:34] <%MoraMiarty> but the rest is alright
[5:52:37] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[5:52:42] <Heartless_01> LUL
[5:52:43] <%MysteryFaceX> How wrong you are, Mora. How wrong you are...
[5:52:50] <%madhattergay> is pat's mic quiet or am i just high?
[5:52:58] <%Maids4lyfe> both
[5:53:04] <%cvp5127> yes
[5:53:14] <%demegodz> Pat a tired boy
[5:53:21] <Madbearv> oh man I'm player 1k in line
[5:53:35] <%Valdorick> He's high Pat! He's talking about high stuff!
[5:53:35] <KishinGrek> Well hes talking to paige , not us
[5:53:37] <%Michael_Erazo> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[5:53:37] <%spiritofmojave> brain is crying or frying?
[5:53:39] <supernice1> The mix just sounds biased towards game sound
[5:53:42] <Madbearv> these queue times
[5:53:46] <%MysteryFaceX> Well the alternative is they're high.
[5:53:58] <%PanicSwytch> i guess the game volume is louder than your mic. but its good, no worries
[5:54:20] <FeralRageGaming> much better
[5:54:23] <%Maids4lyfe> turn it back up
[5:54:25] <supernice1> Yes much better
[5:54:32] <%king_wragles> MaKe GaMe LoUdEr
[5:54:37] <%Toast_Master_General> Can't please everyone
[5:54:38] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[5:54:38] <Thalchampz> LUL
[5:54:38] <MESeele> Yeah make the game louder
[5:54:40] <%Valdorick> To be fair, most of the time that's because its story shit - but this has been 4 dungeons in a row.
[5:54:41] <%MysteryFaceX> Oh, I just realised that boss is the little girl at the beginning that gets transformed.
[5:54:50] <%spiritofmojave> Never satisfied here lmao
[5:54:52] <%demegodz> Yeah this is good
[5:54:55] <%Michael_Erazo> is it okay to take my time to catch up to Shadow Bringers or will I miss out on anything?
[5:55:04] <+TheImmortal70> It’s perfectly fine
[5:55:05] <%MysteryFaceX> I suppose WoL just murders her.
[5:55:15] <%Maids4lyfe> she was already dead
[5:55:46] <+TheImmortal70> This rabid, growling monstrosity’s life matters
[5:55:50] <%Michael_Erazo> thanks TheImmortal70
[5:55:53] <+TheImmortal70> So she can take other lives
[5:55:54] <%Valdorick> Paige has never been more Tsundere
[5:55:57] <%Keyd00d> damn this stream started when I left for work and now I'm back home
[5:56:02] <+Xalgar> @angriestpat I remember healing you in Halatali HM and I was on edge because I couldn't remember any of the boss mechanics LUL
[5:56:39] <%madhattergay> i wonder if shadowbringers is taking away viewership from GDQ or vice versa
[5:56:46] <%jittyot> how long does it take to like get to the good stuff in FF14?
[5:56:49] <Madbearv> man these wait times
[5:57:00] <%Mekhet09> Yeah these wait times blow.
[5:57:09] <%luftraumm1> there's good stuff all throughout
[5:57:09] <+TheImmortal70> It takes getting to around 60
[5:57:13] <%jittyot> like leveling i mean
[5:57:21] <+WizardofAahz> I'd say 50
[5:57:22] <%jittyot> ok thats not terrible
[5:57:22] <%MysteryFaceX> I couldn't stand the voice acting in ARR.
[5:57:25] <%luftraumm1> 30
[5:57:26] <%Kaz_zaK> Kaz_zaK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! yo just got gunbreaker shits dope anyway 10 months wow uh keep being a cool weirdo and pet elmo for me apatDab
[5:57:28] <%spiritofmojave> once you get out of 30ish it picks up
[5:57:28] <Madbearv> as soon as you get your job
[5:57:31] <+Xalgar> @madhattergay GDQ brings in a bunch of non twitch people so not much
[5:57:34] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @madhattergay a lot of peeps only seem to tune into gdq for games they care about anyways so prob not much
[5:57:45] <AnAnonymousCheerer> Anon100 Anon100
[5:57:47] <AnAnonymousCheerer> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 3 others in Chat!
[5:57:51] <+TheImmortal70> Classes get completed at 50 then from then on more cool shit gets layered on
[5:57:57] <%Keyd00d> I just got to Garuda and excited to get to the HW stuff soon
[5:58:06] <Madbearv> I already miss Flash
[5:58:10] <%Mekhet09> Classes get completed at 70.
[5:58:18] <%Mekhet09> Anything lower and you miss mechanics.
[5:58:25] <%madhattergay> hey if i buy shadowbringers do i also have to purchase the other expansions?
[5:58:25] <%jittyot> because all the late game stuff and different jobs seem cool
[5:58:26] <%Mekhet09> Some classes like War just get better at 80.
[5:58:31] <%MysteryFaceX> The end quests that lead to ARR were pretty spectacular, though.
[5:58:36] <%Mekhet09> Or become different classes like SMN.
[5:58:42] <%MysteryFaceX> Er, HW, I meant.
[5:58:50] <%luftraumm1> after garuda comes the worst part of the game iirc
[5:59:09] <%MoraMiarty> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[5:59:10] <%spiritofmojave> Company of heroes [shudder]
[5:59:10] <%Mekhet09> HOLY SHIT I'm 142 in queue after almost an hour.
[5:59:12] <%Keyd00d> Well that's sad to hear
[5:59:17] <supernice1> So is this is just a basic dungeon from the new expansion?
[5:59:18] <+Xalgar> forsenPls
[5:59:22] <+BlackJack607> That's a cool boss
[5:59:26] <Madbearv> I'm number 1476
[5:59:28] <moogleboy1984> the tone of this expac is so damned good
[5:59:29] <%Mekhet09> It's the first dungeon.
[5:59:37] <%templar010> Huh, jumped dancer?
[5:59:43] <%templar010> Also I love this theme
[5:59:46] <$cureneckbeard> !uptime
[5:59:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 59m.
[5:59:51] <$KnivesEve> is that anti-venom
[5:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[6:00:09] <%Keyd00d> HYDRATE
[6:00:13] <supernice1> I know almost nothing of FFIV. Played WoW for years though
[6:00:26] <%heyitsbrian> does pat has maximum hydration?
[6:00:33] <%Neryl_> is chat very slow or is twitch being dumb
[6:00:37] <+Xalgar> I miss Cleric Stance guzuCry
[6:00:40] <supernice1> XIV*
[6:00:40] <%Mekhet09> War had stance switching.
[6:01:01] <Madbearv> this music
[6:01:03] <Madbearv> is so good
[6:01:11] <suikudo> We traded in stance dancing for an actual dancing job
[6:01:19] <%heyitsbrian> @Neryl_ I think chat is just less populated
[6:01:21] <%spiritofmojave> hard to see this theme getting repetetive compared to SB, good stuff
[6:01:35] <Madbearv> Stormblood wasn't bad
[6:01:41] <Madbearv> It just wasn't as good as HW
[6:01:45] <@Velyndra> lol
[6:01:45] <%Keyd00d> oh shit
[6:01:52] <CurrySauseBandit> LUL
[6:01:58] <%spiritofmojave> lmao
[6:02:01] <moogleboy1984> Stormblood was bad
[6:02:08] <moogleboy1984> it was too split
[6:02:12] <+Xalgar> Stormblood is a 3/5 along with 2.0 IMO
[6:02:12] <+ThruLidlessEye> i havent played an MMO since "Classic Runescape" was just called Runescape
[6:02:21] <moogleboy1984> Doma/Yanxia should have been it's own expansion
[6:02:28] <+ThruLidlessEye> scary number game
[6:02:30] <%Faustgesicht> Eh still listen to Worm's Tail, though I haven't got there yet
[6:02:36] <%madogod> @AngriestPat i've been watching your stream all day. did your character even die today?
[6:02:40] <+12char2short> What am I witnessing?
[6:02:47] <%MysteryFaceX> Reminds me of music from Terra Battle.
[6:02:50] <MESeele> he died during this run
[6:02:55] <%madhattergay> hey pat GDQ is closing out with a 6 hour chrono trigger speedrun tomorrow. are you planning on watching that?
[6:03:00] <%Maids4lyfe> you're witnessing pat murder an abomination against nature
[6:03:14] <CurrySauseBandit> @madogod He died once cause he didn't look at his hp bar.
[6:03:16] <frozenprince18> Is Pat playing on PC or PS4?
[6:03:28] <+mik255> @AngriestPat favorite boss theme?

[6:04:41] <%Maids4lyfe> @frozenprince18 the game is optimized to run perfectly with a controller, but you need a keyboard for typing in chat
