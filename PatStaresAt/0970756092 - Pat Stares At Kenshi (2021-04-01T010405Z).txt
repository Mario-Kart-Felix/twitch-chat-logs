[0:00:04] <+NecDW4> Hes said he kinda hates that shit
[0:00:05] <%bassoontyphoon> hes back!
[0:00:05] <+allups> @T_Sasquatch Bold and brave
[0:00:07] <T_Sasquatch> WE BAKKKK
[0:00:07] <%justcallmebobplease> ?
[0:00:09] <ghoulspan> The base builkding and managing is legit one of the best of any game
[0:00:10] <%JoshManVGH> but like Hours. How many hours of play until Kenshi gets fun?
[0:00:11] <Meltgar> Pat fixed the Gief stream Kappa
[0:00:14] <WinglessParatroopa> I've never played Kenshi but I hope Pat finds a way to enjoy it like ya'll who've played it.
[0:00:14] <aiutare47> We back!
[0:00:17] <+glgzephyr> @SwdVengeance Could it be that it uses the same engine, down to the merchant UI?
[0:00:18] <+Solutha> You dont have to watch a tutorial, the tutorial speeds up the learning curve lmao
[0:00:19] <%SirGO0SE> @SwdVengeance exact vibe i got
[0:00:22] <%Daxalog> Is he switching to valorant?
[0:00:23] <+panlakes> Now I can say I was here at the very start hehehehhe
[0:00:23] <ullyzeez> ayyyyyye
[0:00:29] <+OwlLightningMage> I was having fun playing Kenshi right away
[0:00:40] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt just stream you playing re2 in your head
[0:00:42] <sendart> Kenshi doesn't seem like it provides much structure which is bad for Pat brain
[0:00:48] <%backfire_shot> you dont need to watch a tutorial or anything for this game i assumed with how the game looked it didnt have a presence on youtube for years and just learned to play
[0:00:50] <%SwdVengeance> @glgzephyr Holy shit, seriously? No wonder I got that vibe instantly.
[0:00:53] <DianaTheAscian> yourself*
[0:00:54] <Ekaelis> @JoshManVGH Almsot instantly if you dont opt for mining start, which is a mundane as in any other game
[0:00:58] <RWLJr98> real footage
[0:01:06] <samazam94> @ghoulspan he watched sseth's review. he said that like a dozen times already. also, knowing that it opens up (way) later doesnt change the fact thatbthe beginning is ass.
[0:01:07] <cheapdoc> I feel like this Kenshin thing is an acquired taste
[0:01:14] <Luizabd> Kenshi wasn't as hard for me to get in and I was blind on it
[0:01:16] <+glgzephyr> Seriously, take another look at those merchants. Straight out of NWN
[0:01:17] <Slimshazbot> We're talking about a guy that only ever makes himself in character creators, I don't think he has the imagination for a "make your own goal" sort of game
[0:01:20] <+RootVeggie> Honestly Kenshi isn't actually hard to get into, it's just chat being kind of unhelpful and Pat not picking up the starting quest
[0:01:22] <LunarRemix> @OwlLightningMage But you've got to admit it's unlikely most people will. It's not a game for everyone especially if you jump in blind
[0:01:27] <%Alazull> New Strem
[0:01:27] <%walternatorz> yay new stream
[0:01:28] <%AzureGale> Wow, just a hard reboot huh
[0:01:29] <plushy0> I love kenshi but yeah...sad to see he's having a bad time with it
[0:01:29] <+Veraverse> LUL
[0:01:30] <+panlakes> anyone else hype for new Bindingg of Isaac DLC?
[0:01:33] <lambishly> Kenshi is like whiskey your first shot WILL suck
[0:01:34] <Hellarussian> yo
[0:01:34] <TheA1ternative> yeah you have to get beat up in kenshi a bit to get more into it
[0:01:35] <%MechArch> psaDab psaDab
[0:01:36] <balthazar758> @cheapdoc definitely feels like it is
[0:01:36] <%Alazull> Kenshi so bad we pretend it didn't happen
[0:01:37] <%bassoontyphoon> hard reboot
[0:01:38] <%blastyoboots> HI
[0:01:44] <yourliteraldog> Are you winning son?
[0:01:46] <%bassoontyphoon> HeyGuys
[0:01:49] <%daws_combine> daws_combine subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 14 months of asking for S.T.A.L.K.E.R on stream knowing it will never come, but I'll live with knowing I was the one to make the James Hetfield Pyro story a thing on the podcast I guess
[0:01:50] <ullyzeez> hi handspme
[0:01:50] <faegbeard> bricked by kenshi pog
[0:01:50] <%redthebaron> defeated by kenshi
[0:01:50] <lambishly> Kenshi defeated your monitor
[0:01:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Most people should not go into Kenshi completely blind.
[0:01:52] <RWLJr98> You did this Kenshi fans
[0:01:52] <Hellarussian> thats always a good sign
[0:01:54] <RWLJr98> YOU
[0:01:54] <Orenjevel> kenshi lit it on fire
[0:01:55] <%AzureGale> Thanks Kenshi I guess
[0:01:57] <T_Sasquatch> are you winning son ?
[0:01:57] <malletman241> 'that kenshi caused'
[0:01:58] <%BinaryFireball> pat just play something you want to play
[0:01:58] <MrFlugaFluga> 10/10
[0:02:00] <Mr_Rakjo> Working as intended LUL
[0:02:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> I should have been here from the start
[0:02:01] <jorniev> daaaaamn
[0:02:04] <+allups> damn
[0:02:07] <lambishly> 10/10
[0:02:08] <ullyzeez> is it ok now??
[0:02:08] <owazowski> Dang Pat started streaming late today
[0:02:08] <+allups> bad hit opat
[0:02:09] <+glgzephyr> that is fair
[0:02:13] <+Veraverse> Damn
[0:02:13] <%backfire_shot> Kenshi wins again
[0:02:14] <@SoFarFetched> refunding Kenshi confirmed.
[0:02:15] <Siconia> Oh yeah that's a good one
[0:02:16] <lambishly> It was made by 1 dude
[0:02:16] <%bassoontyphoon> RIP Kenshi
[0:02:18] <%justcallmebobplease> It's not even wrong to associate that - he literally had that happen
[0:02:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat will litterally never play this game again LUL
[0:02:21] <RWLJr98> Downloaded the virus known as "KENSHI"
[0:02:24] <%JoshManVGH> "It's an acquired taste" is perfect for this game, holy fuck.
[0:02:26] <Siconia> Dude play something else
[0:02:30] <lambishly> It's VERY cult pat
[0:02:30] <+glgzephyr> what the fuck was going through your guys' heads when you recommended this?
[0:02:36] <T_Sasquatch> pat its not your fault, this is not a YOU Thing. the game is fucked
[0:02:41] <%Axellogic> Its one of those takes AWHILE to get rollin
[0:02:42] <%Gogogolem> Theres nothing here
[0:02:43] <Luizabd> Didn't you talk about how you hate sandboxes games?
[0:02:44] <DianaTheAscian> its prob cool but it seems a bit unfriendly to new players
[0:02:47] <%BinaryFireball> Kenshi is a hardcore sandbox game. It is your bane
[0:02:47] <+Dorf1> i cant believe kenshi was too powerful for pat
[0:02:52] <yourliteraldog> This is such a pc game it only wants to be played on a monitor
[0:02:52] <@SoFarFetched> @glgzephyr he watched a sseth video and got interested from that.
[0:02:53] <+AnimationAtNight> Same reason people play Dark Souls Pat
[0:02:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> can you play kenshin on the nvidia thing and let someone else's hardware die?
[0:02:54] <%bassoontyphoon> Kenshi is an MMO for people who dont want to actually interact with other people
[0:02:55] <%DukeMoose> i'd need more than this chat window to explain how i like it
[0:02:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't get it either, Pat.
[0:02:55] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt If you want to give Kenshi a fair shot, it takes a LOT of legword.
[0:02:56] <Siconia> Maybe try it in your spare time
[0:02:57] <+hrudzie_1> is he already done?
[0:02:57] <KingFatality> it's fun for a specific type of person, it's hyper open ended and I like it for that, but you would absolutlely hate it
[0:02:58] <Meltgar> I guess, Kenshi ain't easy
[0:03:00] <%darklordfodder> don't play this on stream,  I think.
[0:03:01] <TheFramedWarlock> Just change games it's fine
[0:03:01] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Yeah starting at the beginning with no research was a bad place to start
[0:03:04] <Orenjevel> Don't sacrifice your hardware for it
[0:03:05] <ghoulspan> its not for everyone but if you get invested into it, its really addicting and fun
[0:03:05] <+allups> play it off stream and just talk about it on the pod its just as good
[0:03:05] <jorniev> its just a uterlly terrible tutorial for  a stream
[0:03:07] <malletman241> they thought youd give it a chance
[0:03:09] <T_Sasquatch> to see you suffer
[0:03:09] <IntrepidEye> Its a very slow burn but it gets fantastic once you get more characters and start building
[0:03:10] <lambishly> Yeah Kenshi is not a good reccomend
[0:03:10] <+OwlLightningMage> It's the biggest big number game
[0:03:10] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> its very hard to get into at first
[0:03:11] <+panlakes> To torture you.
[0:03:12] <Fien111> I don't either, it's a game for like 20 people and I'm barely one of them
[0:03:13] <Man_in_the_Red> "imagine Fallout but with Hokuto no Ken instead of nukes"
[0:03:15] <%Dunmarkh> I highly reccomend doing one of the starts where you have a party, you can automize and also win fights, explore the world
[0:03:15] <+eanscrale> I didn't even know this game existed.
[0:03:16] <TheA1ternative> it takes a bit to get into
[0:03:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's niche as hell, and should not have been a blind stream start
[0:03:17] <%MidnightBurst12> I takes time
[0:03:18] <+Despera__> @PatStaresAt I lopve how archaic and fuck you it is, also reminds me of being 12 and playing Morrowind and ignoring the main quest
[0:03:18] <%BinaryFireball> Pat did you play mount & blade?
[0:03:19] <%Agami23> because people have bad taste?
[0:03:20] <cheapdoc> Because game bad > funny
[0:03:23] <aiutare47> Its a game with a cool setting and lore. its fun, building bases is cool, finding goals is cool. @PatStaresAt
[0:03:24] <+Goshism> Streets of rogue! Fun and has twitch integration!
[0:03:24] <%vaporousTippler> Don't ever play Daggerfall.
[0:03:24] <TheA1ternative> like a session
[0:03:25] <%walternatorz> it's completely bereft of direction or structure
[0:03:26] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt it's super open ended and that's the appeal for me
[0:03:26] <lambishly> It's like Morrowind with no quests
[0:03:26] <dan_g_v> was wondering the same
[0:03:27] <+glgzephyr> Or side quests either
[0:03:31] <RWLJr98> It should at least have a good tutorial
[0:03:31] <%Aeoneth> It seems to me like it has a bunch of systems that can play off each other, but no tutorialization/starting flow
[0:03:31] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt You need to either have a guide person who already knows the game introduce you almost co-op style, or be at LEAST as far over on the spectrum as I am @___@
[0:03:33] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> it's a rags to riches type experience like a lot of rpgs
[0:03:36] <plushy0> in kenshi you can do anything, like anything. become a farmer, drug lord, king, tyrant, barkeep
[0:03:36] <samazam94> at the end of the day he didnt like kenshi, and thats all there is to it. stop trying to justify your enjoyment of the game by forcing him to like it
[0:03:37] <s1rcuit> the important thing is that you tried
[0:03:37] <TB_Meister> It like Dwarf Fortress. Its not actually fun to play, but you get interesting stories out of it. And the lore is very interesting
[0:03:37] <SovPho> It is a game designed literally for people that want to do RP builds in Elder Scrolls games.
[0:03:41] <+WizoSavage> It's a slow start, but building a base is basically as endgame as it can get
[0:03:42] <lambishly> yes
[0:03:42] <jorniev> YES
[0:03:42] <aiutare47> YEP
[0:03:42] <+Despera__> IN A GOOD WAY
[0:03:42] <+seoliart> Yep
[0:03:43] <RWLJr98> Bare minimum a tutorial
[0:03:44] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah its not the prettiest game
[0:03:44] <+panlakes> It wasn't for your benefit, it was for chat's benefit.
[0:03:44] <+allups> yep
[0:03:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Correct
[0:03:45] <%walternatorz> agreed
[0:03:45] <Siconia> Yes
[0:03:45] <T_Sasquatch> yes
[0:03:46] <%Archphronimos> it do look not great
[0:03:46] <EuropanLamprey> Some people love the no structure "Here's a world, go nuts" type of game
[0:03:46] <ghoulspan> @PatStaresAt slave is one of the hardest starts whoever recommended it you you wanted to troll you
[0:03:47] <%redthebaron> i do
[0:03:48] <Meltgar> Yeap
[0:03:48] <MrFlugaFluga> wrong
[0:03:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[0:03:49] <yourliteraldog> It looks like witcher 1
[0:03:49] <%redthebaron> yeah
[0:03:49] <jorniev> YUP
[0:03:49] <%BinaryFireball> game looks like solo dev
[0:03:49] <+OwlLightningMage> It was made by one guy
[0:03:49] <DianaTheAscian> BROWN
[0:03:50] <%MidnightBurst12> facts
[0:03:51] <%Dunmarkh> not entirely wrong
[0:03:51] <+seoliart> ITS PERFECT
[0:03:51] <IntrepidEye> Yep
[0:03:51] <KingFatality> absolutely
[0:03:52] <+Double_Tap_That> It's beloved because it offers unprecedented freedom for gameplay, but I don't know why people wanted you to play it.
[0:03:52] <%backfire_shot> yes this is true
[0:03:52] <%Aeoneth> So it's seems like it's something that's really cool when your like 200 hours in
[0:03:53] <Man_in_the_Red> which is why Kenshi 2 is a long ways away
[0:03:54] <+OwlLightningMage> It is
[0:03:55] <lambishly> Oh yeah
[0:03:55] <cheapdoc> yes
[0:03:55] <%bassoontyphoon> i like the artstyle at least
[0:03:55] <aiutare47> YES
[0:03:55] <+TungstenViper> LUL
[0:03:56] <maskedmook> yep
[0:03:56] <%BinaryFireball> interface it terrible
[0:03:56] <Luizabd> THat dosnt really matter
[0:03:56] <IntrepidEye> Yes again
[0:03:57] <%Dunmarkh> nah
[0:03:57] <%justcallmebobplease> ALSO CORRECT
[0:03:57] <+allups> yepper s
[0:03:57] <KingFatality> agreed
[0:03:58] <%redthebaron> it sucks so much
[0:03:58] <jorniev> absolutly
[0:03:58] <MrFlugaFluga> its bad in a good way
[0:03:58] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> the ui is pretty ehhhhhh not great
[0:03:59] <%blastyoboots> true
[0:03:59] <warmnoid> SOUL
[0:04:00] <%bassoontyphoon> yes
[0:04:01] <wolfen091> still more watchable than fortnut
[0:04:03] <+allups> LUL
[0:04:03] <%walternatorz> Yes
[0:04:03] <+TungstenViper> BROWN
[0:04:04] <+seoliart> YES I LOVE IT
[0:04:04] <+Kitrane> oh yea. its visually janky and cluttered as hell in the interface. I agree
[0:04:04] <aiutare47> Correct
[0:04:04] <jorniev> YES
[0:04:05] <Jontman42> yeah sure
[0:04:05] <+coolthulhuu> ha yeah tru
[0:04:05] <lambishly> Coded by 1 person
[0:04:06] <%BinaryFireball> sure
[0:04:06] <Dommykins> It's probably one of those games that's fun after like 30 hours of banging your head against the wall, but the people that have already done it and enjoy it sort of skip over the terrible part i ntheir mind.
[0:04:07] <KingFatality> yup
[0:04:07] <T_Sasquatch> yes , also correct
[0:04:08] <%blastyoboots> correct
[0:04:08] <+glgzephyr> @SovPho Dude, Neverwinter Nights has already existed for over two decades. Those people are WELL fed
[0:04:10] <%bassoontyphoon> YUP
[0:04:11] <%sleeplessmetro> Everything here just seems frustrating to try and get into
[0:04:13] <+allups> ight i gatta go eat
[0:04:13] <yourliteraldog> That eurojank
[0:04:13] <Xiangchang> I think Bannerlord might be a bit better to try sometime.
[0:04:15] <%backfire_shot> text has always been bad lol
[0:04:18] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> because it wasnt made for it
[0:04:18] <+OwlLightningMage> It was made by one guy
[0:04:21] <ullyzeez> QOL motherfucker
[0:04:26] <%walternatorz> "DVANCED OPTION"
[0:04:27] <dan_g_v> looks like beta steam junk
[0:04:27] <%DukeMoose> because it came out nearly a decade ago
[0:04:27] <BliVru> what happened?!
[0:04:28] <+OwlLightningMage> That's fair
[0:04:29] <%TheLakinessMonster> Oh yeah, that's a time sink game. It's enjoyment is exponential. Not good in the beginning at all.
[0:04:29] <T_Sasquatch> it gets good 30 hours later Kappa
[0:04:30] <%redthebaron> the jank is here you can't escape it
[0:04:30] <codizle> Seems like a cool game that's bad for streamign
[0:04:32] <jorniev> AGREEE
[0:04:34] <lambishly> It was made by one guy
[0:04:35] <cherrycottontail> it looks okay, it's developed by one person
[0:04:36] <+allups> sur
[0:04:37] <%BinaryFireball> yes it is janky solo dev
[0:04:43] <jorniev> BAD TUTORIAL
[0:04:43] <+OwlLightningMage> I disagreee
[0:04:44] <+panlakes> whoever mentioned mount and blade, that is absolutely the better choice
[0:04:47] <ullyzeez> LUL
[0:04:50] <yourliteraldog> does it?
[0:04:50] <+allups> noithng should get good in 30 hours
[0:04:51] <Luizabd> Nope not 30 hours
[0:04:52] <BliVru> sadly in aint for everyone thats a shame
[0:04:52] <malletman241> no it gets good with any effort to understand it on your part
[0:04:54] <+Solutha> Nah, the game has a haunting beauty in many areas
[0:04:55] <+Kitrane> I never would have been able to stand Kenshi any little bit if I hadn't played the Mount and Blade series
[0:04:55] <aiutare47> 30 hours is a huge strech, its fun 30 minutes in
[0:04:57] <+PsychicExtremist> It's not a good game to stream but as far as sandbox games go there's so much to do in it
[0:05:00] <%DukeMoose> its an indie game from 2013
[0:05:03] <@SoFarFetched> You guys say "it was made by one guy" but look at Stardew Valley,that was also one guy LUL
[0:05:04] <%walternatorz> the enjoyment curve is severely delayed
[0:05:04] <%Dunmarkh> JUST START WITH A PARTY, IT LET'S YOU THINGS
[0:05:04] <Man_in_the_Red> "oh yeah, Final Fantasy 13's great, trust me bruh"
[0:05:10] <Luizabd> That a stupid hyperbole
[0:05:11] <BliVru> @patstaresat dont worry man you did your best
[0:05:12] <+seoliart> There's nothing quite like Kenshi
[0:05:12] <Giztech> Black Skylands might be your style. there is a playtest on steam at the moment if you want to try it.
[0:05:15] <ghoulspan> base building is great, the micro managing you can do is one of the best of any game
[0:05:18] <+RootVeggie> Alright now time to play Might and Magic
[0:05:19] <+glgzephyr> @aiutare47 This stream was longer than 30 minutes. Try again?
[0:05:19] <TheA1ternative> try the different starts, slaves start was a mistake
[0:05:20] <+TungstenViper> Chat, the excuse of "it was made by 1 guy" means nothing. who cares if it's made by 1 guy? it's still bad
[0:05:20] <+OwlLightningMage> I was having fun right away. I also didn't go in blind
[0:05:21] <+Kitrane> Dunmarkh why you yelling
[0:05:23] <blackbaron98> stream bannerlord instead
[0:05:23] <%TheLakinessMonster> Just watched it, lots of mods were used in that video.
[0:05:26] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt I disagree with the UI. It doesnt look realyl any worse to me than the older Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale UIs. Even Divinity 2 wasnt great
[0:05:27] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt It doesn't take 30 hours to get fun, i just takes some prep work before jumping in to figure out how to play. It CAN be fun out the gate if you know what you're doing.
[0:05:28] <Orenjevel> imagine how much fun you could have with another thing in those 30 hours tho
[0:05:30] <+allups> @Man_in_the_Red LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:05:30] <%justcallmebobplease> It kinda seems like you picked the worst possible starting class, relative to first-time experience?
[0:05:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> I only ever started by fast forwarding hundreds of days as a slave to get jacked.
[0:05:31] <Iza_kku> it's fun enough just running around the map with a squad in kenshi
[0:05:32] <%darklordfodder> it's not a game, it's lifestyle.
[0:05:34] <Luizabd> Nope
[0:05:34] <%Alazull> The Sseth video should've mentioned that what you start at is reading a wiki for several hours to know what the hell to do
[0:05:35] <jorniev> guys remember he is tarting from scratch with ZERO knowledge, MIGHT  as well be 30 hours
[0:05:37] <@SoFarFetched> One guy can make a game REALLY Good. But at the same Time one guy can make a game pretty bad.
[0:05:39] <malletman241> yeah because you a bitch
[0:05:39] <KaiserMario> Pat looking like Limmy on that "kilogram of feathers" video...
[0:05:40] <samazam94> you cant just expect pat to stream the game for 30+ hours before he finally get to enjoybthe game
[0:05:45] <Luizabd> You should really just go with the default start
[0:05:48] <Ekaelis> Okay, thats wrong, part of Kenshi experience is building from the very scratch
[0:05:48] <SovPho> fair
[0:05:49] <+Solutha> its cuz its easier
[0:05:50] <+panlakes> Bannerlord > kenshi, it's more of a game out the box
[0:05:50] <Fien111> The game is wrong about itself
[0:05:51] <+seoliart> The default way is the sufferer's way LUL
[0:05:51] <Dommykins> Bannerlord probably is the best version of this type of game to get into
[0:05:52] <+glgzephyr> @TungstenViper That excuse held water over a decade ago, not so anymore. Team Cherry is three people plus a composer
[0:05:53] <+OwlLightningMage> I played the default start and had fun
[0:05:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like the game would be a lot better if you started from anywhere other than rock fucking bottom tbh
[0:05:57] <aiutare47> @glgzephyr have you played the game? if you havent then obviously Pats gameplay isnt going to sell you
[0:06:06] <Iza_kku> yeah i did the 1 guy start, at the hub
[0:06:07] <+HexForest> It's not Pat's fault, the intended way to paly Kenshi is just one that's very slow to start
[0:06:09] <Luizabd> ppl don't know how to talk about this game since the played it a lot
[0:06:09] <ghoulspan> @PatStaresAt not all the start are the same difficulty, some starts are harder than others
[0:06:09] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot But he doesn't know what he's going
[0:06:12] <%bassoontyphoon> fair
[0:06:15] <%BinaryFireball> you selected the correct difficulty but you didnt... play the game the way it was meant to be played
[0:06:18] <+glgzephyr> I have not played this game, and I will absolutely never touch it
[0:06:18] <malletman241> well its a good thing you're a fulltime reviewer
[0:06:18] <%TheLakinessMonster> It did say the way the game was intended to be played.
[0:06:18] <cherrycottontail> It's not the game isn't fun until 30 hours, it's that the game can be crazy at 30 hours. THe game is fun because of the build up to the 30 hours
[0:06:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah, it’s a weird one
[0:06:19] <%AncelDeLambert> oh hey Pat
[0:06:21] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Solo is the intended way and it is fun to play if you know how, but having  a group out the gate makes it wuicket to get into for a stream
[0:06:21] <%Dunmarkh> Then you're going to need to invest more time
[0:06:23] <yourliteraldog> Sometimes game devs are wrong? Case in point the Murader from doom.
[0:06:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> wouldnt be the first time a developer does not understand why its game is fun
[0:06:26] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Just play mount & Blade instead
[0:06:27] <BliVru> This is a really bad game for streaming if you dont know are new
[0:06:29] <%Aeoneth> This seems like one of those games you need the wiki open for
[0:06:31] <%MidnightBurst12> the game was made by psychopaths, i wouldn't trust that
[0:06:32] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt the stuff sseth talks about are all true and fun but the fun is in setting those goals yourself, and I know how much you dislike open ended games
[0:06:32] <+WizoSavage> despite the game saying "this is intended" it's not, it's a sandbox survival
[0:06:34] <aiutare47> @glgzephyr Then dont get mad in chat
[0:06:35] <Fien111> It's masochism, plain and simple. CBT the game
[0:06:36] <%justcallmebobplease> But you changed the 'way to be played' by being a midget robo, didn't you?  Like, that's not a fair assessment of the norm if you deviated from it - and it sounds like going robo is a BIG deviation.
[0:06:36] <ullyzeez> how could you have not expected this pat????
[0:06:36] <jorniev> i thought you at least knew what the game was about, thats why i wanted to see you play it
[0:06:41] <mybigmeech> Anarchy in chat WutFace
[0:06:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Chat is the crazy one today
[0:06:42] <RWLJr98> is that just an analogy? I'm replaying halo and have been playing normal;
[0:06:43] <%JoshManVGH> One guy can also make a game that is suuuuuuper niche to their tastes. Kingdom Death Monster as an example.
[0:06:45] <TheA1ternative> @PatStaresAt try the different starts
[0:06:47] <jorniev> TRUE
[0:06:47] <sendart> seems like a super slow game
[0:06:50] <+glgzephyr> @aiutare47
[0:06:51] <aiutare47> Absolutely correct
[0:06:52] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> parties can be hard in the game  because if your not managing them correctly and feeding them it can be difficult to keep going because everyone is starving the fuck up and possibly dying. The more party members you have the harder it is to manage your crew doing indivudal tasks to the point where someone is bound to die at any minute after running into bandits or something while you arn't looking. always fun when a dude loses an arm like that lol.
[0:06:53] <%BinaryFireball> it assumes you know what you're getting into
[0:06:54] <$StrawberryPantsu> Just play the game :^)
[0:06:57] <+HexForest> The game's meant to be played through pure trial and error, just bashing your head against things until you learn
[0:06:57] <%Dunmarkh> did you play it?
[0:06:58] <worldbrand> think you'd come back to it offstream if you had a buddy guiding your hips?
[0:06:59] <+glgzephyr> @aiutare47 I'm not mad, I'm incredulous
[0:07:02] <T_Sasquatch> ay man, sometimes you dont need to get why a game is fun, sometimes people just like weird shit
[0:07:03] <EuropanLamprey> Same problems as Minecraft?
[0:07:04] <malletman241> 'this one man indie needs AAA qol'
[0:07:04] <+Despera__> it's a "correct way" for the start you choose
[0:07:05] <%sleeplessmetro> This seems like a game youd really play on your own time at your own pace JUST so you can get the feel of anything it has to offer
[0:07:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is just not going to like this game.
[0:07:09] <cheapdoc> guys, kingdom death monsters has a guide to how to play it
[0:07:12] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex Which is why he needed to do research. That can put people off I get that, but that's the step you need to take to enjoy the game
[0:07:12] <%PinkSuprende> the game is for masochists, small indie team, wait for kenshi 2, should be less opaque and terrible
[0:07:13] <@SoFarFetched> @worldbrand kenshi has left a bad taste in his mouth if it almost ruined his new TV
[0:07:13] <%MuffledEurobeat> The correct way to play it is with a dance pad
[0:07:15] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt In terms like this game, do you go HEAD ON to games you have never played, or have you seen gameplay videos and judge them to play or not?
[0:07:18] <KingFatality> yeah it's pretty misleading
[0:07:18] <yourliteraldog> It makes sense this game was made by a single crazy man
[0:07:19] <malletman241> then maybe experiment you coward
[0:07:21] <TB_Meister> Kenshi, I would describe as a CBT game. It's painful, but some people are into it
[0:07:22] <cheapdoc> this had jack all
[0:07:22] <%Archphronimos> I like the progression that you can make in Kenshi. I like growing a merry band of misfits into a small empire.
[0:07:22] <%Aeoneth> You gave it a fair shot Pat... that looked difficult to say the least
[0:07:23] <Visorak6> Kenshi players going their own way?
[0:07:24] <Ipsenscastle> it's literally just sink or swim
[0:07:25] <%Monkeyweed21> TIME FOR MINECRAFT
[0:07:25] <+Despera__> you can fuck off and do w/e but some starts benefit certain play styles
[0:07:25] <%kujofire990> wut i mis
[0:07:25] <blackbaron98> The game isnt for you, that's fine
[0:07:30] <+TungstenViper> @glgzephyr also, i get the sentiment, good for that 1 guy getting things done, but it's sill bad nonetheless. props to him for accomplishing such a fit, but a game of this complexity needs a real team
[0:07:34] <+MacBeyer> its not a matter of being correct, its a matter of difficulty that isn't just a slider.
[0:07:34] <+glgzephyr> did people really just compare this game to Kingdom Death Monster?
[0:07:37] <%thegreatbambe> thegreatbambe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! poop lol
[0:07:37] <+OwlLightningMage> This game isn't for you
[0:07:44] <NoirePanzer> Hey Hey PogChamps
[0:07:45] <RWLJr98> Don't compare Minecraft, a surval game to an overhead sandbox RPG
[0:07:46] <+killer_squid1990> Seth also didn't show the lengths it takes to get to that part
[0:07:48] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I highly recommend someone doing a specialty run to kind of figure out what you want to do right off the bat.
[0:07:49] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt  if you play mount & blade (which is a much more approachable version of this sort of game) then I think you might understand kenshi and how to play it
[0:07:50] <Luizabd> Did you only see that of the game?
[0:07:51] <greytiziocaio> You need someone that is really into the game and talk with them directly
[0:07:52] <%GarbageNirvana> It's the kinda game that tells you to play your own way and then absolutely destroys you when you try to play it in any way other than what it actually wants you to do
[0:07:54] <cheapdoc> even totalwarhammer 2 has more direction and that's a straight up rts
[0:07:54] <Dommykins> Bannerlord or Battlebrothers would be a good alt probably
[0:07:54] <BliVru> Theres a video by a guy called CharlatanWonder thats really good
[0:07:57] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot The game should have a basic tutorial at the very least.
[0:08:00] <%Gogogolem> Pat i don't know what the game is.
[0:08:01] <JetpackMcQuack> This was my experience with kenshi years ago
[0:08:01] <ChungusQuest> Ah, the magic of good editing
[0:08:03] <+OwlLightningMage> The moment to moment is not dying.
[0:08:05] <Meltgar> Yeah, Sseth's video didn't mention the START
[0:08:05] <+AnimationAtNight> @PatStaresAt Watch GeneralSam's videos on it
[0:08:09] <TheA1ternative> try the different starts!
[0:08:11] <+Kitrane> I will say you put more effort than a lot of people. I've seen plenty start and then shortly start cussing and yelling in frustaration.
[0:08:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> Does a game with no goal has a Endgame?
[0:08:16] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Seth"? We talkin' about African Warlord Seth?
[0:08:17] <%bassoontyphoon> time for disco?
[0:08:18] <Jerp> can someone link Seth's video? I'm kinda curious now
[0:08:20] <aiutare47> The game is very complex and requires you to try a few different times at the early game to sink your teeth in. If you dont enjoy it thats ok. @PatStaresAt
[0:08:20] <%DukeMoose> Kenshi 2 will probably have a better tutorial
[0:08:22] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I recommend watching the torso experience run amphibian did which got a lot of attention for the game recently.
[0:08:23] <SovPho> it would be easier
[0:08:28] <T_Sasquatch> further knowledge is required
[0:08:30] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex I agree. But it doesn't. He wants to know how people enjoy. the answer is you have to research it.
[0:08:31] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> he goes through alot of the moment to moment gameplay
[0:08:31] <%dekkitout> Hugh Mann
[0:08:32] <+WizoSavage> Yes
[0:08:33] <%JoshManVGH> @cheapdoc Righ, but the first kickstarter the guy mentioned making the game exclusively for himself. He just needed the kickstarter and enough people to back it so HE could get a copy. And it shows the game is crackerjack.
[0:08:33] <+killer_squid1990> Yea
[0:08:33] <TheA1ternative> food and medkits
[0:08:33] <%Dunmarkh> You'd be able to actually heal
[0:08:34] <aiutare47> yeah
[0:08:34] <MrFlugaFluga> @illTemperedSeaBass ye
[0:08:35] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt What about setting a goal and letting chat hold you hand till you get the feel for mechanics?
[0:08:36] <jorniev> you die make a new character try again
[0:08:36] <SovPho> skeletons are by default hated in the world of Kenshi
[0:08:37] <Luizabd> I would be better to do this off stream
[0:08:38] <TB_Meister> Spend 15 hours mining copper to build a base to lose it immediately to raiders.
[0:08:38] <%Broand> goal "survive"
[0:08:38] <Meltgar> @Jerp CHeck on youtube Sseth Kenshi
[0:08:39] <ullyzeez> yes
[0:08:40] <%MidnightBurst12> at the start
[0:08:40] <%justcallmebobplease> I mean, you'd heal WAY easier, which would totally change things.
[0:08:42] <TheA1ternative> or buying
[0:08:43] <+WizoSavage> yes
[0:08:43] <samazam94> just type in sseth kenshi on yt
[0:08:44] <Chinchiillus> yes
[0:08:44] <dragoon001914> It's Sseth with two S's
[0:08:45] <%DukeMoose> correct
[0:08:45] <+Solutha> Steal, get money, buy house in town, get more money, train
[0:08:45] <%Dunmarkh> mining, stealing, looting
[0:08:45] <aiutare47> Steal or mine yeah
[0:08:47] <%redthebaron> and you started with money too
[0:08:47] <Luizabd> YEs
[0:08:48] <+OwlLightningMage> There's more
[0:08:48] <Jerp> thanks @Meltgar
[0:08:49] <+glgzephyr> it's like Runescape, but worse!
[0:08:50] <lambishly> Kenshi is desert hobo simulator
[0:08:50] <rosysyntax> You would've had more direction, but you'd still be climbing the cliff that is this game's difficulty curve, without guidance
[0:08:50] <TheA1ternative> or finding
[0:08:50] <+PsychicExtremist> looting stealing exploring ruins or mining probably
[0:08:50] <%MidnightBurst12> or scavenging
[0:08:52] <+OwlLightningMage> There's lots more
[0:08:57] <+GarouFGC> Or following around a patrol and stealing from the dead.
[0:08:58] <+messentry> trading, cultivating
[0:08:59] <Stigmergy> stealing, mining, trading, scavving
[0:08:59] <%DukeMoose> or you starve and take skill penalties
[0:09:00] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot That's seems like a bad game then
[0:09:01] <+OwlLightningMage> There's lots of way to start the game
[0:09:01] <+Jiggisnipe> get money for food and water?
[0:09:02] <%Dunmarkh> you expand
[0:09:02] <aiutare47> start exploring
[0:09:02] <jorniev> kite enemies into defenses
[0:09:02] <+Double_negative> Mineing, stealing, going to a bigcity and looting the corpses of bandits that attack the walls.
[0:09:03] <Chinchiillus> Basic start is mining or stealing until you can hire some food and hire another person to watch your back
[0:09:03] <Iza_kku> i missed the start of where you started. but yeah. food, water. you could lure bandits to town and when they die loot them
[0:09:03] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> a ton more
[0:09:04] <aiutare47> Huge map
[0:09:05] <%justcallmebobplease> BUILD
[0:09:05] <%BinaryFireball> your immediate goal is to survive, your longer term goals are to make a band of dudes and go build a bandit base and then go raid
[0:09:05] <+AnimationAtNight> whatever you want
[0:09:05] <lambishly> whatever you want
[0:09:07] <sendart> Look for stuff to do
[0:09:08] <malletman241> you might have to use your imagination
[0:09:09] <+WizoSavage> Get more guys, increase productivity
[0:09:11] <%Broand> You try get nice things
[0:09:11] <%backfire_shot> buy a house start researching
[0:09:12] <+killer_squid1990> Whatever you want, travel, trade, explore, make a base, be bandits
[0:09:14] <+AnimationAtNight> conquer the whole world if you want
[0:09:14] <+TungstenViper> only 1 question: Why is the game fun? what makes it fun?
[0:09:14] <TheA1ternative> explore, find recruits, you can go solo or get a party
[0:09:15] <mybigmeech> Tf I can't see pats messages
[0:09:15] <ullyzeez> then what LUL
[0:09:17] <jorniev> Exploration
[0:09:18] <+PsychicExtremist> you can do whatever - be a slave owner, fight bosses, take over a faction etc.
[0:09:20] <%captain_thickthighs> since pat is gone "opens coat" anyone wants some nfts
[0:09:20] <%blastyoboots> idea is GET HUGE KILL STUFF
[0:09:21] <+Solutha> Explore the massive fuckin map maybe
[0:09:21] <aiutare47> Explore the crazy locations
[0:09:22] <yourliteraldog> Become Alexander The Great
[0:09:22] <%JoshManVGH> Life: The Game
[0:09:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Start out mining to put bread on the table, and get better at stuff, so you can start building and mining more, and begin research.
[0:09:24] <+messentry> i personnaly build a kung fu monastery
[0:09:24] <Iza_kku> then you figure out what faction you wanna fuck up when you can subsist
[0:09:24] <Stigmergy> get three (3) people in your party
[0:09:24] <%MidnightBurst12> you start exploring
[0:09:25] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> tricking the stupid ai into doing dumb shit is the best.
[0:09:25] <%redthebaron> you get big it is a grind game
[0:09:28] <TB_Meister> Murder all the prominent characters in the world
[0:09:28] <TheA1ternative> explore is the interim step
[0:09:29] <%Archphronimos> I like to explore the different weird biomes and see the weird animals
[0:09:29] <%bassoontyphoon> if its not appealing to you dont play it
[0:09:29] <+glgzephyr> You people keep saying "whatever you want" without ever getting specific once
[0:09:30] <RWLJr98> none of them help you start the game lol
[0:09:30] <+OwlLightningMage> You get huge
[0:09:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Heads up, Rimworld is gonna be more of the same of this, but 2D overhead
[0:09:33] <+WizoSavage> Kenshiro rules
[0:09:34] <+AnimationAtNight> It's like RolePlaying
[0:09:34] <maskedmook> it sounds like nothing
[0:09:34] <TheA1ternative> find quests
[0:09:35] <+Despera__> I freed a couple slaves trained my thieving and then wandered the land to find cool cities I bought scrolls for
[0:09:35] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex If you want to write if off on that, fine, But it's a good game for plenty of people.
[0:09:36] <huskarl_zap> mine
[0:09:36] <Gabintzky> once you get food, get into fights
[0:09:37] <cheapdoc> @JoshManVGH After what we just saw, I believe it
[0:09:38] <cherrycottontail> it's an rpg pat, the interim is implied. You sit there and grind stats and money
[0:09:39] <lambishly> Big grind
[0:09:39] <%Dunmarkh> You just need more party members to win fights and automate the boring shit
[0:09:40] <+messentry> build a house
[0:09:42] <Badgerconda_> Explore and get swole? It's not that complicated.
[0:09:42] <Giztech> kenshi is just harsh in every aspect, it's meant to be played for the slow long burn. It never makes it easy. the best was is to use factions against each other. even then it will still shit on the player
[0:09:43] <BliVru> Just go to a part of a map that looks cool
[0:09:44] <%DukeMoose> Help fight bandits when towns are attacked/you kited them in, gear up a lil more, get enough money for a friend, own property, maybe research more stuff
[0:09:45] <%BinaryFireball> figuring out the interim steps IS a big part of the game
[0:09:45] <+messentry> then a village
[0:09:45] <ullyzeez> imagine MMO but without the online part
[0:09:49] <+messentry> plant stuff
[0:09:50] <%blastyoboots> --you DID describe some interim steps to be fair
[0:09:51] <crabmeat495> There are bounties to go after for money, and plenty to explore and folks to meet
[0:09:53] <+IMAS101> rimworld i can at least understand and has better ui
[0:09:57] <+OwlLightningMage> There's lots of way to start the game
[0:09:57] <+glgzephyr> This sounds like it would only be fun with three other people on Discord
[0:10:02] <T_Sasquatch> WATCH A GUIDE, an actual guide if you care
[0:10:04] <%Dunmarkh> well you can manage a town in kenshi
[0:10:04] <Broken_Sonex> @glgzephyr EXACLY
[0:10:05] <+WizoSavage> Your goal can be to eradicate the Holy Nation
[0:10:05] <jorniev> yes this is kenshi though
[0:10:05] <samazam94> this is the minecraft conundrum again
[0:10:09] <%PinkSuprende> Lure packs of 20~30 feral hogs into town, steal guards equipment, sell it elsewhere, cook the feral hogs by building a campfire
[0:10:10] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah you gotta look around and figure out  WHAT exactly you wanna run your route too. there are places in this game that are basically impossible to do due to the difficulty of the surrounding area.
[0:10:14] <balthazar758> beep boop
[0:10:15] <+GarouFGC> The goal for Kenshi is.. Manage your colony until you take over the wastes.
[0:10:15] <+Solutha> Yeah an kenshi is manage your dudes and get BUFF
[0:10:16] <+messentry> you can destroy factions that you don't like
[0:10:16] <penitentpendant> This feels like a game where you have the argument "Is the journey worth the destination?" And response is "If you read all these guides that aren't in the game, absolutely!" "So, no, then."
[0:10:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> You guys
[0:10:19] <%BinaryFireball> these games are about learning how to play the game, its exploration and discovery of the map and mechanics
[0:10:19] <+Jiggisnipe> @ullyzeez that's called Xenoblade Chronicles
[0:10:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Make number go up
[0:10:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Godzilla vs Kong was FUCKING AWESOME
[0:10:22] <+PsychicExtremist> In kenshi your early focus should be survival, once you've seen more of the world you will decide on a goal
[0:10:23] <T_Sasquatch> this is not the minecraft conundrum
[0:10:28] <Man_in_the_Red> Pat needs him some yummy Bread Crumbs
[0:10:29] <lambishly> A lot of Kenshi is your own RP fun with it, you cannot go in expecting it to provide anything because it is JUST a sandbox
[0:10:29] <DirtyMiser> Early game will be survival but by end game will be city builder
[0:10:31] <Iza_kku> lets work with pat
[0:10:32] <%Landralin1996> This game is like playing a sandbox D&D campaign with a rules-lawyer DM
[0:10:35] <+saltyvest> Kenshi is for youtube where you can just skip hours
[0:10:38] <%darklordfodder> it's more of a toy than a game, from what I've seen
[0:10:39] <cheapdoc> @JoshManVGH this is a game for nobody, except the one dude that made it. Could be a fun dnd setting maybe
[0:10:40] <+OwlLightningMage> This game doesn't play like any game you have literally ever played
[0:10:41] <Siconia> That's a pretty good game
[0:10:41] <Chinchiillus> It really is you have no goal at the beginning other than train up your dudes. You are so shit at everything that your only real goal is to train your guys to be decent at something
[0:10:42] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> like imagine starcraft and you wanna bait the enemy to your main force alot of the game becomes that early on.
[0:10:42] <ChungusQuest> It felt like a D&D game with a very simulationist laissez-faire DM.
[0:10:42] <+Double_negative> Step two, get a squad, starting training your dudes to go to more dangerous areas, beating up bandits, get beaten up by bandits.
[0:10:43] <Siconia> Both of those
[0:10:46] <T_Sasquatch> i wont let pat just believe he is crazy, this game is not it
[0:10:46] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Build a base, form a slave rebellion, assasinate the emperor, get into smuggling drugs, etc.
[0:10:48] <+Kitrane> Say you get a decent amount of food and cash. get a small house so you have a sleeping area or something. then next goal be...say......hunt some animals or trade between towns.
[0:10:48] <Luizabd> Same here
[0:10:49] <+RootVeggie> Pat there are quests
[0:10:50] <TheA1ternative> thats kenshi also @PatStaresAt
[0:10:50] <aiutare47> Absolutely not comparable in my opinion
[0:10:55] <%Vyskus> I have no clue what kenshi is but it seems like you just do whatever you want, seems like the point of the game is to be the ultimate sandbox
[0:11:00] <%RyanGelatin> what even the fuck is a kenshi
[0:11:03] <Iza_kku> that sounds exactly liek kenshi loop
[0:11:04] <Siconia> Subnautica: Below Zero hits 1.0 soon
[0:11:06] <malletman241> none of the other ones gave you the ability to put in the time to understand something? you could just not make this the game's fault lol
[0:11:07] <MrFlugaFluga> never
[0:11:08] <%BinaryFireball> When you decide what you want
[0:11:09] <+Goshism> Too much time is needed to have fun
[0:11:11] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt There is no ending or goal unless you make it yourself besides simple survival.
[0:11:12] <TheA1ternative> exploring and finding out new things
[0:11:15] <+OwlLightningMage> The beginning when you know what you're doing
[0:11:16] <fatlystackedmac> what the fuck is up my dudes
[0:11:17] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> that part comes from the tension doing mundane tasks and something going hilariously wrong like rimworld.
[0:11:17] <TheA1ternative> finding fun npcs
[0:11:17] <aiutare47> pat you never went anywhere
[0:11:18] <crabmeat495> When you don't get immediately killed and have a crew you can maintain
[0:11:18] <bonebagMEL> I dont think you enjoy it
[0:11:18] <Giztech> it
[0:11:19] <%BinaryFireball> you enjoy it when you decide what you want and go get it
[0:11:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> The acquisition of power and resources
[0:11:22] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot I don't see how this can be enjoyable.
[0:11:23] <Fien111> When you've got like 5 dudes in "OK" gear
[0:11:24] <Imbetweenjobs_> freedom from being a slave
[0:11:24] <lambishly> The enjoyment is the struggle, if you do not enjoy the struggle you will not enjoy kenshi
[0:11:24] <%Dunmarkh> when you have a party
[0:11:25] <+OwlLightningMage> You just aren't gonna like it
[0:11:25] <cheapdoc> But a dnd game is not tied to the rules of programming and dnd campaigns usually have a goal or a plot
[0:11:26] <+messentry> you can dedicate your playthrough to develop your guy to be super badass
[0:11:26] <%dekkitout> What is the t-minus till tech tree progression or whatev
[0:11:26] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt You never left the first square mile
[0:11:26] <+WizoSavage> Surviving = enjoyment
[0:11:27] <+TungstenViper> Chat, news flash: if you need external info taken from the itnernet to enjoy a game, then the game is not good, also that's called cheating
[0:11:28] <Iza_kku> you kind of just don't tbh. the bit by bit build up is so slow
[0:11:31] <IntrepidEye> Make money, buy more characters, explore and build
[0:11:32] <RWLJr98> ???
[0:11:32] <Iza_kku> it's really boring
[0:11:32] <randomahole> exploring and poking around
[0:11:34] <+glgzephyr> LMAO
[0:11:34] <penitentpendant> He ran around a ton
[0:11:35] <+messentry> exploring
[0:11:38] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like Kenshi has a similar loop of survive 1st (food and shelter)
[0:11:38] <ullyzeez> pat its ok just say you dont like it
[0:11:38] <TheA1ternative> theres MUCH more to explore
[0:11:39] <%Dunmarkh> you didn't explore at all
[0:11:39] <%Archphronimos> you can hunt for legendary weapons if you fancy
[0:11:40] <Fien111> Pat the map is like 50km
[0:11:41] <IntrepidEye> Thats literally no hwere
[0:11:41] <%Broand> If you want a more newbie friendly version of this style of game, try Mount and blade
[0:11:42] <baronashby> You didn't haha.
[0:11:42] <+GarouFGC> Kenshi is purely a game for Masochist.
[0:11:42] <%LordSDB> For me its the many ways you can succeed and fail, and work back up to or continue to keep pushing forward
[0:11:43] <Stigmergy> you only stayed inside the zone you started in lmao
[0:11:43] <+Despera__> that's barely anywhere in Kenshi terms
[0:11:44] <Visorak6> Pat didnt even fucking know where anything was, of course he wouldnt go anywhere
[0:11:44] <+OwlLightningMage> That's nothing in Kenshi
[0:11:46] <Ekaelis> You just fumbled about, attacked random people and quit LUL
[0:11:48] <%vaporousTippler> And, just like with jogging, that was a waste.
[0:11:48] <+impressionistcowboy> I do think it's one of those games that requires you to slog past 4 hours and then you have enough to change the world
[0:11:49] <+glgzephyr> he literally died multiple times for exploring
[0:11:49] <+AnimationAtNight> It's D&D @PatStaresAt , live out your power fantasy or whatever
[0:11:49] <RWLJr98> You get killed by EVERYTHING
[0:11:49] <ghoulspan> The moment you start to enjoy Kenshi is when you start figuring out how things work, did you expect to become a master of the game not even 30 minutes in?
[0:11:51] <%Vyskus> He never went anywhere because he left then immediately got gangbanged and died LUL
[0:11:53] <+Solutha> Its the same loop
[0:11:53] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:11:53] <cherrycottontail> You enjoy it right away if you are the people who the game is made for, it's building to something, grind those stats, find money
[0:11:54] <%backfire_shot> Exploring the world which you can do at any time but getting stronger and having friends helps
[0:11:54] <Shinny1338> Someone needs to make you a start game that is mid-tier equipped
[0:11:55] <%Dunmarkh> you went to a town, talked to nobody
[0:11:58] <aiutare47> You went from squim from hub right. Did he ever leave the Border Zone?
[0:12:00] <IntrepidEye> you didn't even leave the starting area
[0:12:00] <cheapdoc> Its not dnd
[0:12:01] <Hellarussian> yeah
[0:12:02] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> theres places that are much more interesting than starting zone.
[0:12:04] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt it's the open ended nature that is the fun, the grind is a lot and it becomes tedium but the freedom the game provides is the fun
[0:12:05] <Giztech> once you have a party with highest stats possible looking at like 10-20 hours in
[0:12:06] <%JoshManVGH> @cheapdoc Seriously. Like I'm glad it exists, for the people who like it. But WOW is that not me.
[0:12:06] <%Agami23> pat never attacked people. people attacked pat.
[0:12:06] <fatlystackedmac> yo play mount n blade
[0:12:07] <%DukeMoose> there are multiple biomes in kenshi with lots of funky atmospheres that look purdy
[0:12:08] <+Double_negative> That is nowhere in Kenshi, World is big.
[0:12:09] <+glgzephyr> Pat's about to hit the nail on the head
[0:12:10] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Like the fog lands which is an area of pure death
[0:12:10] <samazam94> exactly
[0:12:14] <%BinaryFireball> chat cant explain it to you in a sentance
[0:12:14] <+OwlLightningMage> The game is more fun when you know what you're doing
[0:12:15] <+fetrigon> did you go into points of interest on the map?
[0:12:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Peple who don't?
[0:12:16] <baronashby> Start as settlers and hire mercs and go into the swamp.
[0:12:16] <lambishly> LUL
[0:12:17] <%vaporousTippler> You're looking at it as a game. It wants to be a simulation.
[0:12:18] <iosephe> ANYTHING
[0:12:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> The world is very large and full of empty space
[0:12:20] <+glgzephyr> BUT WHAT THO
[0:12:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Video game go brrrr
[0:12:21] <cheapdoc> @JoshManVGH same here man
[0:12:22] <%HefestoForges> @PatStaresAt the game is unforgiving and hard, but the payoff is immense
[0:12:22] <jorniev> NOT knowing things its REALLY frustatring
[0:12:25] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> definately a ton of trial and error
[0:12:25] <mybigmeech> @tungstenviper That's just incorrect tho
[0:12:26] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt People really aren't giving you the proper basics
[0:12:27] <+Goshism> Pat likes games that have some direction. This game doesn’t have any direction
[0:12:27] <sendart> You hit everything with the hammer
[0:12:27] <sandnoodles> so kenshin got flushed?
[0:12:29] <DetroitSentai> you mess around with the hammer for 20 hours
[0:12:29] <+Jiggisnipe> hit nails idiot Kappa
[0:12:31] <+Despera__> you swing the hammer around until you figure it out
[0:12:33] <TheA1ternative> @PatStaresAt I heavily recommend trying the other starts of the game like "guy with a dog"
[0:12:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> C O N T E X T
[0:12:35] <Teyaric> It's a context issue between people who were raised to be wage slaves and people who view the world as something to exploit.
[0:12:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> Is that a invitation to hit your?
[0:12:35] <Luizabd> THe game told you that on those tutorial popups
[0:12:35] <%Jekado> "here some legos build... whatever" have fun
[0:12:37] <+panlakes> I appreciate that we can all shit on this bad game together
[0:12:37] <+OwlLightningMage> You shouldn't have went in blind LUL
[0:12:38] <ghoulspan> You can go anywhere, meet people and help them or go to war with the
[0:12:38] <+saltyvest> This is one of those games where you play for 10 hours and understand nothing but then you start again and hunt cannibals. Shit stream game tbh
[0:12:38] <DetroitSentai> which isnt for everyone
[0:12:38] <+TungstenViper> @mybigmeech how?
[0:12:40] <blackbaron98> thats how things are created though
[0:12:40] <lambishly> It is not a good game to stream blind @PatStaresAt
[0:12:41] <T_Sasquatch> because some people literally enjoy random trial and error
[0:12:42] <%HefestoForges> it is a sandbox
[0:12:42] <+glgzephyr> The size of your game world means nothing if it has jack shit in it
[0:12:42] <%debugdrawray_> @vaporousTippler this is a great point
[0:12:43] <Blank9> here's a piece of paper and pencil, you can do ANYTHING
[0:12:44] <+impressionistcowboy> Yep that is a genre, just gotta be aware of that
[0:12:44] <Iza_kku> in kenshi the areas of the map are almost scaled by level. so you get your ass beat by bandits until you can safely explore. when youre stats go up
[0:12:44] <RWLJr98> JUST DO IT
[0:12:45] <cheapdoc> even minecraft has more direction, because in minecraft you can interact with everything
[0:12:45] <Hellarussian> just build it tho
[0:12:46] <%Reaped_Psyche> Is Pat setting up for a different stream or is stream over?
[0:12:46] <%DukeMoose> We are trying to tell you what you can do, its just all getting drowned in the various everythings
[0:12:47] <randomahole> it's like how some people dislike Minecraft. Lack of structure
[0:12:47] <Davimotion96> Bean Dad: the game
[0:12:47] <fatlystackedmac> just do it
[0:12:48] <%sleeplessmetro> What you guys dont factor in is that he has NO IDEA what you need or can or cant do in this game and is only going off of one video that didnt cover much about what you should do i nthe beginning
[0:12:48] <ullyzeez> write that down and save it for the podcast!!! @patstaresat
[0:12:49] <%Dunmarkh> That guy was crazy
[0:12:50] <JetpackMcQuack> But there’s an ikea set right here
[0:12:50] <%MechArch> first time hearing about it. i thought it was a meme game
[0:12:50] <RWLJr98> DO IT NOW
[0:12:50] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> part of it is enjoying that aspect of the game and if you can't then its a problem and a struggle.
[0:12:52] <+OwlLightningMage> You can't just  build a base LUL
[0:12:53] <%BinaryFireball> figuring it out IS the game
[0:12:54] <+WizoSavage> it's a pre-existing world that you get dropped in, choose your biome and survive in it
[0:12:56] <Siconia> No just do it though
[0:12:57] <jorniev> lack of information its totally the games fault
[0:12:57] <EuropanLamprey> Swing Hammer, see what happens
[0:12:57] <zehdre> No just DO IT though!
[0:12:57] <%LordSDB> Yeah that was bad advice, you buy building materials to do that
[0:12:58] <baronashby> the base building is obtuse
[0:12:58] <+AnimationAtNight> DIG UP THO PAT
[0:12:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> @GeneralSCPatton Ha you got timed out?
[0:12:59] <%Archphronimos> you can start from 1 guy and end up playing something more like an RTS with like 30 people, but it takes time to build up
[0:12:59] <yourliteraldog> I figured it out this is BEAN DAD the game
[0:13:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> The building stones that you mine up
[0:13:01] <%Agami23> i cant tell if scpanton was joking or not about RTS games
[0:13:02] <Iza_kku> so if you run too far away, you'll run into stuff that will just curb stomp you
[0:13:03] <TheFramedWarlock> You should look up a guide off stream maybe
[0:13:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "Dig up, stupid!"
[0:13:05] <+Kashishh> game has too much sandbox but no structure
[0:13:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just do it tho
[0:13:06] <%JamesJaystar> Kenshi is a sandbox with no direction or objective. Not everyone can work without an objective, the reason I don't like Minecraft
[0:13:06] <%LordSDB> Mining copper early on is for early money
[0:13:07] <BliVru> @patstaresat This game is really bad for new players. Not just for being obscure but also for thinking that everyone likes not having objectives
[0:13:08] <Talbat> Him screaming at you to build a base first thing is also incredibly terrible advice
[0:13:09] <%Monkeyweed21> JUST OPEN THE CAN PAT
[0:13:09] <Ekaelis> Figure shit out gradually, its a learning experience you only get once, if you want insant gratification, this isn't the right game
[0:13:10] <+Rolandknight> Learn by doing
[0:13:10] <+glgzephyr> Just instantly know how to do everything!
[0:13:11] <Stigmergy> Just be a Wandering Ronin for now, swing sword and kill stuff (and get ass kicked)
[0:13:11] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Sorry, dont mean to sound rude. the games early start is to explore the map and meet people, find cool locations, etc. then once you have money you can start a base. this all takes about an hour or two
[0:13:12] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex I mean, to give some examples of things I've done. I formed a slave rebellion from the holy nation and burned down their capital. I assassinated the emeperor of the united cities. I raised an army of giant crabs and terrorized the coasts. I made a clan of swamp ninjas that smuggled drugs across the world. The game has options, you just need to make the effort to learn how to do things because the game unfortunately doesn't tech you.
[0:13:14] <%dekkitout> That sounds like many many more steps than "Kill the ender dragon"...
[0:13:15] <Man_in_the_Red> Pat cant survive out in the darwinian hellscape that is a lot of these sandboxes
[0:13:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> But why tho?
[0:13:16] <%ssjklyco> It's like scraming at a baby to go and get a job
[0:13:16] <FleshFriend> he was joking im sure
[0:13:16] <Joem1k> Probably should've said what tools to use SoonerLater
[0:13:18] <%Dunmarkh> Everyone in twitch chat wants to talk to you one on one but can't
[0:13:19] <Stigmergy> maybe buy a house in town if you really gotta
[0:13:19] <lambishly> Open the can pat
[0:13:19] <+Jiggisnipe> I feel like the figuring out how to survive could be fun, I would try again with a human
[0:13:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's the reward?
[0:13:20] <balthazar758> "i dunno lol"
[0:13:21] <mybigmeech> @tungstenviper Cause if than like all the monster hunter games before world suck
[0:13:21] <Orenjevel> Just draw the rest of the owl
[0:13:21] <DudeDern> Why
[0:13:22] <%sleeplessmetro> This game doesnt fucking explain anything
[0:13:23] <%kyh9> This game doesnt explain what the goal of anything is tho
[0:13:23] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Just feel it in your heart!
[0:13:23] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> like I appriciate you giving it an honest go pat but like you gotta build yourself up for it and sorta psych yourself up for it. which if you cant then its not fun.
[0:13:25] <Zeldrick> This game is like giving a blind man a hammer and expecting him to build a village, it sounds like
[0:13:26] <fatlystackedmac> play mount n blade is the only viable solution I think
[0:13:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> I love you Pat
[0:13:27] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> obvious i should have spent 4 hours reading guides first
[0:13:29] <%JoshManVGH> Develop an encyclopedic knowledge about a game you've never played before you play the game Pat.
[0:13:30] <+Solutha> I think that was a joke, cuz a base the at start is a bad idea
[0:13:31] <penitentpendant> Well, chat's on fire if nothing else
[0:13:31] <+Plus_On_Black> Flush it, it seem like trash to me.
[0:13:31] <+saltyvest> Legitimately Kenshi is like long-form Starsector
[0:13:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat have my babies LUL
[0:13:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @keiganofastora I showed up right in the middle of all this and tried to shout over an unhelpful crowd.
[0:13:35] <T_Sasquatch> i cant wait for this to come up on the podcast LUL
[0:13:36] <+Kitrane> Pat in this context is like a Pidgeon trying to build a mech made from biomechanics parts while avoiding missiles.
[0:13:36] <+archangel9889> guys after this i dont think he will ever try bannerlord.
[0:13:38] <JetpackMcQuack> And that’s Kenshi
[0:13:39] <%Vyskus> ngl this game seems like it takes an extremely specific mindset
[0:13:39] <Iza_kku> think of it like violent runescape, you gotta tackle the game slowly area by area
[0:13:40] <TheA1ternative> Yes to whoever said that
[0:13:41] <plushy0> Become Drug Lord
[0:13:42] <RWLJr98> progress
[0:13:46] <Badgerconda_> Just play it like a sandbox RPG. Do whatever you feel like, make a story.
[0:13:47] <+GarouFGC> Yes
[0:13:48] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> YES
[0:13:48] <DudeDern> Back to factorio?
[0:13:48] <%Dunmarkh> yes
[0:13:48] <+Double_negative> Honestly you are overthinking it, just start explore.
[0:13:49] <%DukeMoose> yes.
[0:13:49] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> BEEP
[0:13:49] <SovPho> The problem with that is that the game doesn't give a fuck about who you talk to.
[0:13:50] <Fien111> Kinda....
[0:13:50] <TheA1ternative> YES YES YES YES
[0:13:50] <Luizabd> Yes
[0:13:50] <Giztech> in the bars
[0:13:50] <cheapdoc> Talk with whom? They didn't even have dialogue
[0:13:50] <Ekaelis> Yes!
[0:13:51] <Badgerconda_> Yes. They're mostly in bars.
[0:13:52] <MrSparkle21> there are factions
[0:13:52] <%BoxNavy> oh he quit
[0:13:52] <Chinchiillus> yeah
[0:13:52] <+WizoSavage> yes
[0:13:53] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Yes but not too common
[0:13:53] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> yes
[0:13:53] <IntrepidEye> Yes
[0:13:54] <Shinny1338> an hour or two?? lmao
[0:13:54] <greytiziocaio> yes
[0:13:54] <ghoulspan> Yes
[0:13:54] <baronashby> YES
[0:13:54] <blackbaron98> yes
[0:13:54] <%GarbageNirvana> There are beginner's guides out there
[0:13:54] <DetroitSentai> yes
[0:13:55] <+GarouFGC> The boy Beep
[0:13:55] <+Despera__> many
[0:13:55] <%HefestoForges> start with the party for an easier time pat
[0:13:55] <%LordSDB> Yes there are
[0:13:56] <crabmeat495> Unique dialogue is often found in the bars
[0:13:56] <jorniev> yes Like BEEP
[0:13:56] <Stigmergy> there are many NPCs with unique dialogue
[0:13:57] <MrFlugaFluga> most do
[0:13:58] <TB_Meister> Beep
[0:13:58] <plushy0> yes
[0:13:58] <ghoulspan> BEEP
[0:13:59] <%Archphronimos> yes there are
[0:13:59] <its_kleine> yes
[0:14:00] <%bassoontyphoon> yes in bars
[0:14:00] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> your party members have party dialouge
[0:14:02] <%Dunmarkh> yes and some will join you for free
[0:14:02] <@SoFarFetched> @GeneralSCPatton except unfortunately your message sounded VERY aggressive in caps.
[0:14:02] <Luizabd> You talk to 2 ppl on
[0:14:02] <fatlystackedmac> its a unique boiler plate
[0:14:02] <Shinny1338> yeah unique NPC's
[0:14:02] <TheA1ternative> BEEP IS THE BEST
[0:14:03] <Iza_kku> there are like faction leaders
[0:14:04] <Badgerconda_> Not in every bar
[0:14:04] <+GarouFGC> BEEP
[0:14:04] <%dekkitout> How soon can one be met?
[0:14:08] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Absolutely, its hard to understand but you actually only saw two towns, there are like 40
[0:14:10] <lambishly> Kenshi is kinda about self RP not gonna lie
[0:14:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> *airhorn*
[0:14:10] <+TheMorilo> Did you enjoy Mount & Blade?
[0:14:11] <TheA1ternative> ARMOUR KING IS RAD
[0:14:11] <+OwlLightningMage> He's not gonna like this game
[0:14:11] <plushy0> lota lore too
[0:14:12] <%DukeMoose> and theres more
[0:14:12] <SovPho> Because you were a skeleton or some shit idk the game is very vague
[0:14:12] <+libra_zero> You gotta use the hammer to give yourself a concussion to unlock the magic system so you can see the ninja space ghosts
[0:14:13] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> there is alot of party crosstalk
[0:14:13] <%Dunmarkh> You went to one bar and had bad rng
[0:14:14] <DetroitSentai> BEEP
[0:14:14] <Shinny1338> thats just starting town.
[0:14:16] <Ekaelis> You just dont meet unique people under every stone like in most rpgs
[0:14:16] <+PsychicExtremist> NPCs travel around might not be in every bar
[0:14:17] <greytiziocaio> there are thousands of bars
[0:14:18] <blackbaron98> that was 1 bar
[0:14:18] <valhallandoates> bannerlord was a little too sandboxy for me in its current state
[0:14:20] <TheA1ternative> TINFIST AND MOLL ARE RAD TOO
[0:14:21] <Luizabd> In a bar of 12 ppl you talked to like 2
[0:14:21] <+panlakes> has anyone recommended Mount & Blade Bannerlord yet?
[0:14:21] <%backfire_shot> Yes very much there are living legends in this world you just have to find them
[0:14:23] <+WizoSavage> most towns have a Bar
[0:14:24] <Shinny1338> there are 3 unique ones in Squin
[0:14:25] <Giztech> the move around so no always in the same place
[0:14:25] <T_Sasquatch> Look just open the can of BEANS
[0:14:26] <DetroitSentai> yeah its a way more abstract M&B
[0:14:26] <+OwlLightningMage> He just isn't gonna like this game
[0:14:27] <ullyzeez> GIVE UP SKELETON
[0:14:27] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Beep is a character btw
[0:14:27] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot Again. No basic tutorial.
[0:14:29] <+TungstenViper> @mybigmeech if you really NEED external info to enjoy those games, then yeah. bare in mind that external means and enviroment that doesn't concern the game's context
[0:14:32] <+glgzephyr> Yeah you went to two of them
[0:14:33] <BliVru> You should try this: go to the other side of the map. if by the time you reach you still dont like it then you dont like it
[0:14:36] <%JoshManVGH> Theres RNG for bar patrons!?
[0:14:37] <TheA1ternative> Beep is the BEST CHARACTER
[0:14:37] <Chinchiillus> They spawn at specific towns from what I know
[0:14:37] <%Dunmarkh> you didn't talk to anyone in the squinn bar
[0:14:38] <+WizoSavage> Some NPC's are free recruits
[0:14:38] <cheapdoc> Also that game was more silent than one of my dates, that shit was awkward
[0:14:39] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt The second bar literally had afree hire you walked past.
[0:14:39] <baronashby> Still two bars isn't much.
[0:14:41] <yourliteraldog> Opean the bean
[0:14:42] <%blastyoboots> second bar wasn't quite a bar
[0:14:42] <fatlystackedmac> okay but mount n blade tho
[0:14:42] <%Dunmarkh> no ruka
[0:14:42] <%SirGO0SE> i think you went to a bar and a rebel base
[0:14:43] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:14:44] <Badgerconda_> It's a sandbox, pat, it's not like KOTOR or something
[0:14:45] <Siconia> Time for fortnite
[0:14:47] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex Im not saying it doesn't.
[0:14:49] <TheA1ternative> Theres also a depressed skeleton you can recruit
[0:14:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sofarfetched That was my bad for trying to stack emphasis-boosters
[0:14:49] <+Kitrane> You also chose the race that gets treated like 8th class citizens
[0:14:49] <%HefestoForges> @TungstenViper ffs you can read ingame to get info, stop that
[0:14:49] <cheapdoc> 3 seconds of music
[0:14:50] <baronashby> Lots of running in Kenshi.
[0:14:52] <TheA1ternative> he's great
[0:14:52] <+Solutha> one bar a rebel base
[0:14:53] <%blastyoboots> oh i forgot about the squinn bar
[0:14:53] <samazam94> pat why do you still trying to entertain these people?
[0:14:53] <+Double_Tap_That> Kenshi is the definition of a sandbox in that the goal of your game is defined by you.  As for things be explained... the game is just really bad at doing that
[0:14:54] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt its actually kinda cool, you can find the games other protags who are way cooler than you all over
[0:14:54] <T_Sasquatch> just open the can of beans pat
[0:14:54] <%MidnightBurst12> that's nothing, unfortunately
[0:14:56] <balthazar758> @t_sasquatch lol
[0:14:56] <alter_eagle> There’s like hundreds of bars
[0:14:57] <Ekaelis> One unique in Hub, 2-3 uniques in Squin alone, two in total for free when you pass the dialogue
[0:14:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is nota game for you, lets see some more hobocop
[0:14:58] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> yeah some npcs are free recruits
[0:14:59] <yourliteraldog> Fortnite?
[0:14:59] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex I'm literally saying it doesnt have one
[0:15:02] <+libra_zero> Did you try T-posing?
[0:15:03] <+IMAS101> wouldve helped if it did the rimworld thing of going through a few mechanics for early game then let you discover everything else
[0:15:04] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt There are unique NPC's with dialog but they are few and far in-between.
[0:15:04] <plushy0> just make up a goal, like any stupid thing of becoming a ninja or something and go from there
[0:15:07] <lambishly> this is a Sand ass box
[0:15:07] <+JamesJaystar> Mount and Blade gives you objectives
[0:15:08] <+fetrigon> @blivru good idea
[0:15:08] <baronashby> Your speed builds up heaps though over time.
[0:15:11] <fatlystackedmac> play frost punk
[0:15:11] <%JoshManVGH> No Man Sky?
[0:15:11] <%sleeplessmetro> I'm not the one playing and streaming and even Im stressing out
[0:15:13] <+Goshism> But it looks so garbagey why bother
[0:15:13] <%Agami23> its a sandbox game but someones cat thought it was a litterbox
[0:15:13] <%bevyrage> hey have you touched valheim yet btw?
[0:15:13] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> this is one of THOSE sandbox games though where its infamous for not holding your hand
[0:15:14] <FlashFrame> how bad is it?
[0:15:15] <Iza_kku> you'd have to like wiki where "unique npcs" were for recruits. but most "story related " npcs are like faction leader x. and you can align with people
[0:15:16] <+FingaLights> Pat, its not your fault. the opening to the game kinda sucks
[0:15:16] <+glgzephyr> Even most sandbox games have SOME sort of structure to them. GUESS WHY!?
[0:15:18] <ullyzeez> okay how about this what are YOU looking for in this game?? @patstaresat
[0:15:19] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot I had more fun with Daggerfall.
[0:15:20] <Madovir> I just got here and didn't watch any of the gameplay and the people defending whatever game this is are giving THE shittiest advice
[0:15:21] <Stigmergy> lmao The Forest is babby sandbox
[0:15:22] <%Roasted_Pheasant> The forest has a checklist after all
[0:15:23] <%kujofire990> Here's an idea, since you're kind of frustrated. Give Zangeif and Elmo big hugs.
[0:15:24] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> the goals are self-determined like in minecraft
[0:15:25] <ChungusQuest> I think it's fair to say Kenshi is not a tight, precision-crafted RPG experience.
[0:15:27] <+Despera__> ROLEPLAY KINDA
[0:15:28] <%thelaxinator> Satisfactory is sandbox but is basically scripted progression through tools
[0:15:28] <jorniev> Naruto running at mach speed stealth its peak fun in this game
[0:15:29] <jbrachob> those are not sandbox games
[0:15:30] <blackbaron98> in a sandbox you create your own goal
[0:15:30] <%MidnightBurst12> those are sandbox-lite compared to this
[0:15:30] <cheapdoc> Even No Man's Sky starts you with a goal
[0:15:30] <penitentpendant> This isn't so much a 'sandbox' as a 'sandbar'. The box at least has a little structure
[0:15:30] <Giztech> 10hours minimum for a decent party where you can adventure anywhere.
[0:15:33] <baronashby> It's more like Caves of Qud or a roguelike.
[0:15:33] <+OwlLightningMage> The vague obvious goal is to survive and get stronger
[0:15:35] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> yeah at least picking slave you
[0:15:37] <rosysyntax> To be fair, the goal in Kenshi is survive, at first.
[0:15:39] <T_Sasquatch> @sleeplessmetro dude i want to scream, if i was pat i would be livid right now LUL
[0:15:40] <%Dunmarkh> you still have those goals
[0:15:40] <+TungstenViper> @HefestoForges well, i didn't know that. so there's a in-game manual that explains objectives and mechanics?
[0:15:41] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> you'll get some gameplay out of it and a goal
[0:15:42] <BliVru> Dont worry about forcing yourself with it if you dont like it we need to respect that
[0:15:43] <baronashby> Roguelike crossed with Rimworld.
[0:15:44] <lambishly> Yeah that's not Kenshi
[0:15:44] <Fien111> This game is explicitly not that
[0:15:45] <%lilytastic> this game fails where satisfactory succeeds
[0:15:47] <%BoxNavy> whats he pivoting to? if anything at all
[0:15:48] <Badgerconda_> It's a sandbox RPG, not a sandbox survival game though. You've gotta make a story, with your creativity. Like a person.
[0:15:49] <balthazar758> micromanaging to an extreme degree i think
[0:15:49] <Slimshazbot> @Broken_Sonex Okay? It's a wildly different type of game. And you say that like Daggerfall isn't also great?
[0:15:49] <%walternatorz> this game doesn't seem to offer any positive feedback, at least in the areas were we started
[0:15:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat isn't going to like this game at all
[0:15:51] <%kyh9> People blaming the player for not enjoying a game is funny af
[0:15:52] <RWLJr98> Minecraft even when you don't know about ender dragon its easy enough how to figure out how to just survive
[0:15:52] <tranquilturnip> Kenshi is certainly an exeperience
[0:15:53] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Why not set one? try building a base for a start, you can fast track that by choosing the base-builder start
[0:15:55] <mybigmeech> I miss when jerma was playing this BibleThump
[0:15:55] <TheA1ternative> really hoping you get to try the different starts for kenshi
[0:15:55] <lambishly> Game is BIG TIME not that
[0:15:55] <dragoon001914> Kenshi has those goals but the game just has shoddy tutorials
[0:15:55] <+Double_negative> Honestly, advice, if you start again, head south to Squin. More interesting npcs, Can loot corpses of bandits who attack walls. Then can go further south to swamp and the drug trade.
[0:15:56] <cheapdoc> This is not a roguelike
[0:15:57] <akareynolds88> i mean it was pretty entertaining
[0:15:58] <+glgzephyr> I got to be fascinated by people who think this game is good
[0:15:58] <CollinsOfBodom> Current objective: You have no objectives
[0:15:59] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt I was interested in this game because there were no goals and I was free to choose what to do from nothing
[0:16:00] <+WizoSavage> play with a squad for that interesting time you want
[0:16:01] <Ekaelis> Yeah, not happening LUL
[0:16:01] <+RootVeggie> @PatStaresAt This is actually painful that the chat is explaining things really poorly, you might have had a bad start because you picked Skele and that is actually hard mode but in the starting bar in town is always an NPC that will give you a quest and join your party to help give you some direction and help you early game
[0:16:05] <%kyh9> Like, Kenshi might just not be Pat's type of game
[0:16:06] <+Kitrane> Sandboxes have defined borders. this is more of a desert on a foreign planet
[0:16:07] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> its ok pat
[0:16:08] <ullyzeez> yeah nah LUL
[0:16:08] <Teyaric> Some people look at the world as "What can I help with? Who needs my input?" Some people look at it as "what can I fuck with?"
[0:16:08] <ghoulspan> The slave start is for advanced players that know the basics and how to train stealth and assasination, you got memed
[0:16:09] <T_Sasquatch> Pat this is NOT your fault
[0:16:11] <lambishly> You are expecting the wrong things, but that's not your fault
[0:16:11] <jorniev> its not you man
[0:16:11] <Visorak6> Not frustrated
[0:16:12] <Clundy> Kenshi is more like Rimworld x Sims
[0:16:13] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> 100 percent your ok
[0:16:13] <%Broand> Try out Mount and blade because I'd reckon it does the same thing but probably easier to get into
[0:16:13] <$RealThiele> its ok pat
[0:16:13] <cheapdoc> You did nothing wrong here pat
[0:16:13] <mouse_1312> it's not for everyone for sure
[0:16:13] <+panlakes> Are you looking for incentive to continue playing this game or are you looking for alternative suggestions? Why are you talking to us about a game you continue to dislike? Play smt else bro
[0:16:13] <blackbaron98> You dont have to play it
[0:16:16] <%Landralin1996> It's fine if it isn't for you man, this game is fucking weird
[0:16:16] <crabmeat495> Pat, I love your content regardless
[0:16:17] <Siconia> It's all good pat, we get it
[0:16:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Get rich -> ???? -> Fun
[0:16:17] <Orenjevel> its ok
[0:16:18] <T_Sasquatch> It is literally not your fault
[0:16:18] <+Double_Tap_That> It's not a game for you
[0:16:19] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat SUPER tried, be fair.
[0:16:20] <fatlystackedmac> I just got here and am having fun tbh
[0:16:22] <%bassoontyphoon> You did your best and thats okay!
[0:16:22] <balthazar758> i get you
[0:16:23] <tranquilturnip> life sim in the desert, with no real over arching plot
[0:16:24] <baronashby> Not frustrated. It's a weird game.
[0:16:25] <+OwlLightningMage> The vague obvious goal is to survive and get stronger
[0:16:25] <+Despera__> I think everyone who loves Kenshi knows it's confusing as fuck
[0:16:27] <Siconia> Play what you want my guy
[0:16:28] <greytiziocaio> And we love you for that
[0:16:30] <Ekaelis> I wish people would stop calling it a bad game based on 1h long Pat experience
[0:16:30] <Gabintzky> its okay pat
[0:16:30] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt This feels like it's a "niche of the niche" kinda game, which makes it very hard to casually get into it...
[0:16:30] <%BoxNavy> thats the hallmark of a great game :)
[0:16:30] <+Jiggisnipe> no
[0:16:31] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you're doing a good job
[0:16:32] <%Vyskus> Jumping in is like half the fun tho
[0:16:32] <%sleeplessmetro> Play this game on your own time, dont feel the need to stream it if you still wanna try it
[0:16:33] <+FingaLights> You have to wait a few bad hours unless you know already what to do... the opening isnt great @patstaresat  Its not your fault
[0:16:33] <Zeldrick> "Make your own goal with this game". With what? I get talking to more NPC's but it looks too obtuse to just jump into
[0:16:34] <TheA1ternative> the sseth shouldve been enough
[0:16:35] <+TungstenViper> The game is not really user friendly
[0:16:35] <jorniev> a video
[0:16:37] <%Dunmarkh> We can't not explain things poorly, twitch chat sucks
[0:16:37] <SovPho> who the fuck makes a game you have to research before you play it
[0:16:38] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Pat its ok I've played with you for years I'm used to your struggles lol
[0:16:39] <IntrepidEye> If its not your cup of tea then thats fine. You don't have to force it
[0:16:39] <Dommykins> yeah honestly best to just drop this game, it's super obtuse and seems like a game best played off stream.
[0:16:41] <Luizabd> You really don't need research the game
[0:16:42] <%thelaxinator> these streams are usually about first impressions
[0:16:44] <+panlakes> Just play something else, we GET IT
[0:16:44] <Stigmergy> You don't need to do research. All I ever did was watch the Sseth video myself, and I figured it out just fine
[0:16:45] <BliVru> @patstaresat The sequel will have better start
[0:16:46] <%JamesJaystar> I totally get what you're saying pat and I'm the same.
[0:16:48] <+Kitrane> oh I enjoy the game but I know it can be really fucking wonky for most folk.
[0:16:48] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt I absolutely understand your feelings and you are valid in your thinking, and I agree with all of your views on this game, it's really just a game you would hate
[0:16:49] <+TheOlMitcheroo> You just quit too quickly
[0:16:49] <fatlystackedmac> only jabronies research games before they play them
[0:16:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is not going to like this game
[0:16:50] <+WizoSavage> Pat, did you check the stats screen for the characters?
[0:16:50] <Iza_kku> early game is like, making enough money to join the thieves guild in the hub. so like earn 20k money to buy in
[0:16:50] <Badgerconda_> You don't need to do research..
[0:16:52] <+glgzephyr> GAMES SHOULDN'T REQUIRE A SEPARATE BROWSER WINDOW OPEN AT ALL TIMES
[0:16:53] <sandnoodles> bro you shouldnt hve to do research on how to play a video game. If the game doesn't explain itself then its the game's fault
[0:16:53] <+PsychicExtremist> some games are just like this tbh it's why they're niche
[0:16:54] <%SirGO0SE> thats more than enough research LUL dont spoil yourself
[0:16:54] <%spitelite> its a video game it shouldn't require homework to play the game
[0:16:56] <%dekkitout> The most preface a game needs, needs to be on it's steam page
[0:16:56] <Chinchiillus> naw its not your fault. I had the same feeling as you until I watched some video that taught me how to survive in the beginning
[0:16:57] <DetroitSentai> Game is confusing but that what i like about it, i like learning weird systems through hours of trial and error
[0:16:59] <jorniev> like why not?
[0:17:00] <ToneBacas> good game design should be your only guide
[0:17:00] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Aka back in 14 years ago lol
[0:17:02] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt I think 95-99% of the people in chat right now COMPLETELY understand you not getting or enjoying this jank-ass game, and I think the actual fans of Kenshi understand best of all, ESPECIALLY as they lecture you
[0:17:02] <%MugenSandan> GUIDE STREAM GUIDE STREAM
[0:17:02] <samazam94> for once, this time its the game thats fucking weird instead of you
[0:17:03] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt If it aint for you it isnt for you. Its a jank-ass game. I love it but my boyfriend hates it. Dont play it to appease chat, play it if youre having fun]
[0:17:03] <%backfire_shot> @PatStaresAt Not frustrated we want you to like the game because I feel like you will once you get into it
[0:17:04] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Nah man, totally isn't your fault, it's those games that aren't really fun for A REASON
[0:17:08] <+AugustHaze> Watch an entire playthrough Kappa
[0:17:08] <Badgerconda_> Just gotta be willing to go in and fuck around in a game like this. Make mistakes, explore, come up with your own goals, etc.
[0:17:08] <+panlakes> Lots of games to play....
[0:17:09] <+Jiggisnipe> this isn't a Souls game D:
[0:17:09] <plushy0> watch torsolo
[0:17:11] <%bassoontyphoon> You mean you didn't get a 4 year bachelor's in Kenchi-nometry before playing
[0:17:13] <%Agami23> clearly you need to watch a full LP before playing any game
[0:17:14] <dereksbales> kenshi is bad
[0:17:14] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I remember the time we did pvp together the first time lol
[0:17:14] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt For certain games, you kinda have to.
[0:17:15] <%Jekado> no they want you to 100 percent the game first... then play it "fresh"
[0:17:16] <$RealThiele> guide is just a loop of rules of nature
[0:17:16] <%drabberfaun535> woah am i on time for the stream? i thought he started like 2 hours ago
[0:17:16] <+hrudzie_1> no but I like it so you have to do the thing or else wahh
[0:17:16] <fatlystackedmac> you gotta play 30 minutes then spend an hour googling shit
[0:17:16] <Bathezid> you should platinum a game before you play it for the first time :)
[0:17:17] <%BoxNavy> the game should come with a prima strategy guide that says READ THIS FIRST on the cover when you buy it
[0:17:18] <+Double_negative> You dont need research, just need to be willing to dive in and not overthink.
[0:17:19] <ChungusQuest> nah just watch the SSeth review like 20 times and you're basically expert mode
[0:17:20] <+TungstenViper> expecting someone to do RESEARCH before starting a game is so pretentious
[0:17:21] <Luizabd> I jump in blind and had fun but also I wasn't streaming it so who knows
[0:17:21] <%ssjklyco> Monster Hunter doesn't even require research just to try.
[0:17:22] <%sleeplessmetro> Games shouldnt fucking need external guides man, only if you want to get better at the game but not about the fucking basics needed
[0:17:22] <T_Sasquatch> i had to watch a guide for revengence because i didnt understand shit LUL
[0:17:23] <%Axellogic> Watch a full LP then master all the combos before you start your first playthrough
[0:17:25] <%Dunmarkh> Man I'm trying
[0:17:25] <ullyzeez> i mean tbf souls games also need research
[0:17:25] <Blank9> if you go in raw on Kenshi, you WILL catch something
[0:17:26] <%BinaryFireball> its not
[0:17:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Should we start telling you if a game needs a guide or not so you know whether or not to avoid it
[0:17:29] <%Reveresao> Just play some fortnite
[0:17:32] <lambishly> Kenshi doesn't have good design tho
[0:17:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> This game would have warranted watching the first hour of a veteran starting a new game.
[0:17:33] <T_Sasquatch> yes ,yes it is
[0:17:33] <huskarl_zap> david cage was right
[0:17:34] <%walternatorz> a game should be designed so you can be entertained with no prior experience
[0:17:34] <+TheOlMitcheroo> SHUT UP ONE GUY
[0:17:34] <+glgzephyr> Pat, this is just a bad game.
[0:17:34] <Fien111> That's this game
[0:17:36] <+OwlLightningMage> The vague obvious goal is to survive and get stronger
[0:17:37] <+TungstenViper> Exactly LUL
[0:17:37] <rosysyntax> Pat speaks the truth.
[0:17:38] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> "Game overs are a failure of the game designer"
[0:17:39] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt There's literally too much to do at the start of the game. It would be better if it just said, "Hey, this is you. You're the wanderer here's your initial goal and that's it" instead of
[0:17:39] <%bassoontyphoon> its why I hate paradox games
[0:17:40] <mouse_1312> this game does not respect your time, and you have to do some tedious work to get to the fun, I adore it, but it's for sure niche for a reason
[0:17:40] <fatlystackedmac> some games you just don't vibe with its ok
[0:17:41] <+Goshism> Streets of rogue you can get in and play. Play that :)
[0:17:41] <follyofjolly> Oh is the chat goblins right now
[0:17:42] <LunarRemix> Monster Hunter is fun right away to just move and attack and do stuff.
[0:17:43] <penitentpendant> It's a criticism of Warframe that I agree with, and I like Warframe
[0:17:43] <SovPho> "pick your start for some reason"
[0:17:43] <+Kitrane> the streaming aspect also definitely doesnt help this game
[0:17:43] <+GundamF91> You poke and prod at the huge world and figure out what your able too do and probably die alot figuring it out for an hour or so, one of those games
[0:17:44] <Badgerconda_> What's with all the literal NPCs in chat who think you need to research a sandbox exploration game?
[0:17:44] <Clundy> Time for Fortnite
[0:17:44] <RWLJr98> I dont think its meant to be a "FUN" game, meant for people that enjoy grinding a lot maybe. @PatStaresAt
[0:17:45] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt I mean it's not GOOD, but if you can get past that hurdle there's a great game in Kenshi
[0:17:45] <+MacBeyer> thats BS you don't need a guide we haven't ever needed guides.
[0:17:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Teach me more than literally nothing
[0:17:49] <%bevyrage> the only way i got to enjoy kenshi was by having a friend introduce me to stuff and answer questions without spoiling things.
[0:17:50] <Vi_Stri> this game is a bit like Sunless Sea in that way huh?
[0:17:50] <aiutare47> Look its fun for me but if it aint fun for you thats totally fine\
[0:17:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is just never going to like this game
[0:17:52] <alter_eagle> You don’t need research and guides for this game, that would take all the fun out
[0:17:53] <$RealThiele> chat is BIG goblin
[0:17:54] <lambishly> WOW
[0:17:55] <ghoulspan> Kenshi is not a bad game and i will fight anyone that says so
[0:17:56] <samazam94> then this game is a failure
[0:17:56] <yourliteraldog> Kenshi seems like a cool game but necessarily a good one.
[0:17:56] <fatlystackedmac> mallet man a punk
[0:17:57] <randomahole> AAA mentality, unfortunately
[0:17:57] <Visorak6> Thats hella rude
[0:17:59] <Siconia> Stop defending your garbage jank game nerds
[0:18:00] <jorniev> calm down dude
[0:18:01] <%Axellogic> I bounced off Kenshi too when I tried to get into it
[0:18:02] <+archangel9889> @justcallmebobplease how is that a deviation. its a mechanic in the game!
[0:18:02] <%BubbaRands> I shouldn't need a walkthrough next to me the ENTIRE GAME

[0:18:13] <Broken_Sonex> @Slimshazbot How high is that hurdle?
[0:18:13] <%debugdrawray_> i dont get why so many people are invested in pat playing this game like whatever play it yourself why does pat have to play everything you like
[0:18:14] <Bathezid> atpCap "google it"
[0:18:14] <Teyaric> WOMP WOMP.
[0:18:15] <%thelaxinator> wow dude
[0:18:15] <RWLJr98> BAN
[0:18:15] <Badgerconda_> Ohhhh no, he's retarded. :(
[0:18:15] <%lilytastic> It's trying to be "player-agnostic" like Dark Souls, but Dark Souls is made out of hallways.
[0:18:15] <Siconia> Oh oaky
[0:18:16] <+cahv123> I agree with Pat. You shouldn't have to read a scientific paper on how to play a game. The game should have it in the game readily accessible.
[0:18:17] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[0:18:17] <Zebroneath> If a game needs an outside source to know steps 1 - 10. something is wrong
[0:18:17] <%walternatorz> that's stupid
[0:18:17] <maskedmook> so you need to know what to do before starting the game? that's dumb
[0:18:18] <IntrepidEye> Even as a Kenshi can that comment was dumb as fuck
[0:18:18] <baronashby> There's a wiki

[0:18:29] <+TungstenViper> in-game would be appreciated, thanks :)
[0:18:31] <DetroitSentai> i learned kenshi by just playing for hours, didnt look up stuff but obviously that insnt for most people
[0:18:31] <Visorak6> Someone's getting banned
[0:18:32] <sandnoodles> You guys can like kenshin AND criticize it - they're not mutually exclusive
[0:18:32] <%JoshManVGH> This game is like if Starcraft dropped you into a map and only said "Good Luck!"
[0:18:32] <%Dunmarkh> oh boy here we go
[0:18:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt go to KiraNico
[0:18:33] <aablurr> I found Kenshi to be about emergent narrative. You have to bump into enough systems to eventually make your own goal. I can see where Kenshi has an issue of learning how to play the game before learning why you'd want to play the game.
[0:18:33] <mybigmeech> The chat has dissolved into a piss pool
[0:18:34] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> "kenshi starting guide"
[0:18:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> if you need a guide to understand the basics of the game, the fault lies on the game not on the player
[0:18:34] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> a co stream would also work too
[0:18:37] <HeroToxiko> woolieONEGUY ere we go
[0:18:37] <baronashby> If nothing else just the wiki
[0:18:37] <lambishly> WOW
[0:18:37] <%backfire_shot> This is not a game you need to research before hand its like dwarf fortress your character isnt special your going to lose a few times and thats normal

[0:18:38] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[0:18:40] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you somehow trigger my google assistant
[0:18:40] <lambishly> Ban that guy
[0:18:40] <+MacBeyer> the tutorials DID give you suggestions for goals, and all the things you listed in other sandbox games like the Forest are there.
[0:18:41] <Iza_kku> the game is about getting your ass beat for like 90% of the game tbh. it's not intuitive at all. so i get why you might bounce off it

[0:18:44] <yourliteraldog> The wiki for this game sucks ass btw
[0:18:45] <EuropanLamprey> Some people like the "No direction, all Freedom, just do it" type of games.  You are obviously not one of those people
[0:18:45] <%Archphronimos> it's a fair point, the tutorialization in Kenshi is not good
[0:18:45] <%spitelite> oh wow
[0:18:47] <%sleeplessmetro> No no if he wants to have his time in the spotlight lets fucking enlighten the asshole
[0:18:47] <Stigmergy> >he uses chrome
[0:18:48] <+Rekinsinn> NotLikeThis
[0:18:48] <bonebagMEL> Don't the game starts with the starting "scenarios" with a vague objective?
[0:18:49] <$RealThiele> this is amazing watching a hammer be destroyed in real time
[0:18:51] <%Toynota10> look at the sass in this man

[0:18:55] <%Vyskus> I wonder how many people came in here from the kenshi tag because pat is the only streamer with more than 30 viewers lmao
[0:18:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Or just pick up Diablo
[0:18:59] <%Reveresao> someone post a let me google that for you link

[0:19:11] <Man_in_the_Red> the darwinian hellscape of Kenshi really isnt for most people

[0:20:05] <s0nata_ii> uh, sure bud
[0:20:07] <%toastybites> why would there not be a tutorial for this
[0:20:09] <balthazar758> lol, i feel bad for him, but c'mon man
[0:20:09] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> thats how this game turns people into
[0:20:12] <+PsychicExtremist> dwarf fortress is the same though
[0:20:13] <DetroitSentai> No
[0:20:14] <+ForrestofFallenTrees> It feels like a game designed for a designer not a player?
[0:20:14] <$RealThiele> do it my way
[0:20:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> tutorials are expansive
[0:20:18] <s0nata_ii> just play a different game Pat
[0:20:19] <ToneBacas> yeah fuck that
[0:20:20] <thepardack> to play the game you have to shove an entire cactus up your ass
[0:20:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Chat is in denial
[0:20:21] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> in a way sorta
[0:20:22] <whatatkins> ONE GUY
[0:20:24] <Shinny1338> lmao sorry but something about you reading a guide and then saying I'm just reading a guide made me lol
[0:20:25] <+Solutha> ...ONE GUY
[0:20:26] <%JoshManVGH> Dark Souls gives you more goals and direction than this does
[0:20:26] <+TungstenViper> that's the actual paradox LUL
[0:20:26] <%blastyoboots> just to get a leg up
[0:20:26] <LunarRemix> I didn't see it that way. Huh.
[0:20:27] <+Goshism> Do it your way but only by following this guide
[0:20:27] <+TheOlMitcheroo> YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[0:20:29] <+MacBeyer> except you don't have to do that, people suggest it because ITS EASY
[0:20:30] <lambishly> ONE GUY
[0:20:30] <cheapdoc> Those are not tutorial
[0:20:30] <yourliteraldog> Dwarf fortress has no graphics
[0:20:31] <s1rcuit> this seems closer to Sim Cities
[0:20:34] <%Agami23> pat did you look up exactly what he told you to look up?
[0:20:34] <ullyzeez> are we shitting on kenshi today? cuz im down
[0:20:34] <Siconia> Ah pat just give up, your just gonna stir up a bunch of weirdos
[0:20:35] <jorniev> then just play and dont hurry
[0:20:35] <aiutare47> Well yes and no, it makes sense because the open-endedness overwhelms some folks
[0:20:36] <SovPho> lol @ the dude saying to google shit for a game in 2021 because it's 1985 when the entire point of progress is that we don't have to deal with this shit anymore
[0:20:36] <Luizabd> Pat you could just come up with that by yourself though
[0:20:36] <whymymore> woolieONEGUY
[0:20:36] <Fien111> I mean, the dev intended way to do it is to bang your head into a wall for like 20 hours so.....
[0:20:36] <%sleeplessmetro> This is such a great way to bring in new players, fuck thiiiiss
[0:20:38] <Clundy> One Mallet Guy
[0:20:40] <Ekaelis> Hey, if a game tells you to do whatever you want, and it is its main deal, why do you expect to be given direction?
[0:20:41] <+AnimationAtNight> it's not saying to copy it's suggestions for what you can do?
[0:20:42] <TurbulentGun> You don't need a guide, but it need to be clearer what kinds of boundaries the game has between immersion and limitation.
[0:20:43] <samazam94> nope, keep grilling on him pat
[0:20:43] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt yeah it's not a well designed game, and people love to play it because of the odd amount of freedom it provides
[0:20:43] <%Jekado> "ITS OPEN WORLD YOU CAN DO WHATEVER" what did you do "I did what that guy did"
[0:20:43] <Teyaric> ONE GUY. You don't need to indulge these nutters, Pat. It's not for you, THATS OKAY
[0:20:44] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I PLAYED 100 HOURS BLIND
[0:20:45] <ghoulspan> Thats not it at all Pat, you make your own story
[0:20:45] <+WizoSavage> you spent like 20 minutes playing
[0:20:45] <+glgzephyr> It's not a paradox, it's just bad game design
[0:20:47] <%GarbageNirvana> It's interesting that Pat chose to play this in a year that gave us Valheim
[0:20:49] <illTemperedSeaBass> @malletman241 Way to sell the game, fucking retard.
[0:20:49] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:20:50] <%darklordfodder> sort of a learn a rote way before you learn to freestyle thing
[0:20:53] <+Despera__> @PatStaresAt there's a "Getting Started" page on the wiki that's not just a guide
[0:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> That  guy really shutted up
[0:20:54] <%walternatorz> fix us
[0:20:54] <s0nata_ii> I dont think this game is for you Pat
[0:20:54] <Badgerconda_> Seriously though you can just fuck around and explore? I've never looked at a guide and I have like 200 hours in kenshi
[0:20:54] <DetroitSentai> My personal experience is spending hours exploring and learning the systems to figure out what to do but i enjoy that kinda thing and it clearly isnt for everyone\
[0:20:55] <%ChaosVulpes> It's like dropping someone into Monster Hunter without any experience and saying, 'Here, fight Magnamalo now'
[0:20:56] <$RealThiele> yea this game is stream poison
[0:20:56] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Its more like getting ideas from the guide and adapting into something unique for yourself.
[0:20:57] <T_Sasquatch> @malletman241 come on man, give him some more epic gamer tips !
[0:20:57] <cheapdoc> Even sim cities has a structure, and it tells you the things you're missing
[0:20:57] <SovPho> not 1985* mb whatever.
[0:20:58] <%Vyskus> Did you know Kenshi spelled backwards is ihsneK
[0:20:58] <Iza_kku> chat don't let us get one guy'd
[0:20:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> When you fail at dwarf fortress its at least funny.
[0:20:59] <Jerp> I played without a guide. I played as human though, so my primary driver was "I need to eat so I don't die". that got me moving until I learned enough about the world to decide what I wanted to do
[0:21:02] <BliVru> well its a shame but dont worry
[0:21:03] <Khester824> Make you own adventure
[0:21:03] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Not everyone is gonna start out the same.
[0:21:09] <KaiserMario> C'mon guys, if Pat doesn't feel it, don't force it, he'll grow to resent it...
[0:21:10] <T_Sasquatch> YOURE REALLY QUIET MALLET MAN
[0:21:10] <+FallenAngelSC2> @PatStaresAt As a callback to the old David Cage days, Google is a failure of the game designer
[0:21:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat just isn't going to like this game. Which is what I expected LUL
[0:21:12] <+TungstenViper> it's like people on Dark Souls blaming your playstyle because you chose the wrong class and getting stuck and being forced to farm souls.
[0:21:13] <NoirePanzer> God I hope it's just a guide
[0:21:14] <%blastyoboots> @darklordfodder let's not use slurs here plz
[0:21:17] <%toastybites> bruh this man is still going
[0:21:20] <lambishly> Just ban Malletman LUL
[0:21:20] <ullyzeez> oh shit one guy is still here lmao
[0:21:22] <@SoFarFetched> @malletman241 alright you REALLY gotta chill
[0:21:22] <+IMAS101> idk how you make a story when you dont know the words of the game tbh
[0:21:23] <BliVru> @vyskus masaka(?0
[0:21:23] <+FingaLights> @theolmitcheroo me too, but learning the game IS  a bit of a bitch
[0:21:25] <samazam94> aww he deleted his message
[0:21:27] <HeroToxiko> this is like that destiny thing where all of the lore was on a website outside the game LUL
[0:21:30] <Broken_Sonex> @Siconia It's already begun!
[0:21:30] <%SirGO0SE> to be fair to Kenshi - this is about as much research as you need to do for Kotor 2 but for different reasons
[0:21:32] <+OwlLightningMage> This is literally the exact reaction I was expecting LUL
[0:21:34] <+Jiggisnipe> ban that idiot
[0:21:37] <%backfire_shot> @PatStaresAt its one guy I can tell you exactly why we like this game, its that the world and the people in the world are interesting your character isnt special and are a flash in the pan you
[0:21:41] <%baronblank> baronblank subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Despite my inability to get into Yakuza 0, I tried Like A Dragon and am loving it, hard to describe exactly why but I feel like it's better in basically every way (gameplay, story, protag, pacing, etc.), so glad I tried it despite my misgivings
[0:21:41] <@SoFarFetched> I timed him out Pat if you're expecting a reply from Mallet.
[0:21:44] <+hrudzie_1> can we just ban that guy
[0:21:44] <%BubbaRands> Am I watching a mallet get ban hammered? LUL
[0:21:44] <+D00msDayDan> pat may not be having a good time getting into kenshi but i'm having a great time watching @malletman241 get his ass blown out repeatedly
[0:21:46] <RWLJr98> bruh
[0:21:48] <@SoFarFetched> cause he's just being bitchy at this point.
[0:21:52] <%king_wragles> @samazam94 You can't delete your own messages on Twitch, and it even said a mod did it
[0:21:52] <%Agami23> did he get banned yet? i thought him saying a slur was enough to get him banned
[0:22:02] <tranquilturnip> @PatStaresAt do you like the sims, because its kinda like the sims in a way
[0:22:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Who banned now?
[0:22:05] <balthazar758> jesus
[0:22:05] <RWLJr98> but how get group tho
[0:22:06] <%BoxNavy> arf
[0:22:06] <+triumphantapostle> click on the actual guide part
[0:22:06] <Giztech> gotta say I ike kenshi but it's not a game that is easily streamed for instant gratification
[0:22:11] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:22:14] <SovPho> @backfire_shot I think my problem with that description is that Kingdom Come does a similar thing but still has a tutorial. :\
[0:22:14] <%kujofire990> psaDogchamp
[0:22:15] <Siconia> Cool
[0:22:20] <+triumphantapostle> click on getting started
[0:22:21] <%walternatorz> lol
[0:22:22] <Siconia> Fortnite time
[0:22:22] <%ChaosVulpes> My favorite stream is still him wasting like 2 hours trying to get Dragon Age Inquisition to run 'the right way' with the correct display on his screen. XD
[0:22:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Holy shit this game came out in 2013
[0:22:24] <%SirGO0SE> I mean,
[0:22:24] <%toastybites> man the toxicity over such a minor issue
[0:22:25] <samazam94> just ban him, hes clearly doing this in bad faith
[0:22:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why is it being played now?
[0:22:29] <DianaTheAscian> oh someone said a slur?
[0:22:30] <%BubbaRands> Blessed Farfetched LUL
[0:22:30] <%SirGO0SE> I have to do this for FF 14
[0:22:30] <T_Sasquatch> @Giztech Its not about instant gratification
[0:22:33] <+Solutha> You can learn all of this with time in the game
[0:22:33] <+TungstenViper> Read a guide to start a game LUL
[0:22:34] <%MechArch> psaGiefrail
[0:22:34] <JetpackMcQuack> This is more fun than kenshi PogChamp
[0:22:35] <jorniev> Passive aggression in the air
[0:22:36] <rosysyntax> Click the bit where it says DiscoElysium.exe :)
[0:22:43] <ullyzeez> LUL
[0:22:45] <fatlystackedmac> I thought 2018
[0:22:45] <+OwlLightningMage> I kinda wish Pat would stop trying to get it. He's just not going to like it LUL
[0:22:48] <Luizabd> The tutorials inside the game are enough to get by just fine
[0:22:49] <%kujofire990> Pat Stares at: Getting into Kenshi
[0:22:58] <+Goshism> Delete game. Win life
[0:23:00] <lambishly> This is not a good blind stream game not gonna lie
[0:23:02] <Iza_kku> this is a reeeeeal bad way to get a streamer to like a game just sayin too. like just the chat members that pop off on pat
[0:23:04] <%ssjklyco> If a game needs a D&D manual just to start, why not just include a read me with the game download.
[0:23:05] <%Agami23> you could be playing the new binding of isaac expansion right now pat.
[0:23:06] <SovPho> I just 3 carted on HR6 tobi so I'ma just not play that for a second.
[0:23:09] <Stigmergy> "guys I need help" "wait no i don't want a guide" do you see why this is silly
[0:23:11] <+glgzephyr> holy shit, you guys really need to learn how to give effective instructions because you are TERRIBLE at it
[0:23:11] <+OwlLightningMage> The tutorials inside the game are enough to get started
[0:23:12] <Madovir> pat stares in disbelief at chat defending bad game
[0:23:14] <+FingaLights> did pat read the in game tutorial?
[0:23:14] <%cvp5127> the test is tomorrow pat
[0:23:15] <Siconia> Get in to Janky Games
[0:23:18] <+TungstenViper> i don't get it. so are there tutorials in the game?
[0:23:19] <ullyzeez> i hope kenshi becomes a long form series
[0:23:20] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt This is a good page to help alleviate the overwhelming menu-hell that this game starts you with
[0:23:20] <+TheMorilo> Isn't this just a guide
[0:23:20] <Teyaric> This is a weird EXPLOIT THE WORLD game. And that doesn't appeal! It's okay, man. XD
[0:23:22] <+Allyofwar> Alright everybody. Who wants Pat to just play Subverse? Raise your hands.
[0:23:24] <SovPho> you could be p r e l o a d i n g outriders
[0:23:26] <T_Sasquatch> i'll be real i remember hating ffxiv , i was doing a bunch of side quests withotut realising the msq is what matters LUL
[0:23:27] <%Vyskus> I wonder if this game would be improved by a quest log saying "Become God"
[0:23:28] <%saadi90> That’s too much work to figure out a videogame
[0:23:28] <Luizabd> This is just the tutorial in game
[0:23:28] <RWLJr98> It's not the worst game, just hates new people
[0:23:30] <s1rcuit> @jorniev it's as passive as you'd like to believe Santodes!
[0:23:33] <+BubbaRands> Get Into Indie Games: For Understanding?
[0:23:33] <lambishly> You probably won't find that Pat
[0:23:34] <yourliteraldog> Didn't think but thoroughly unsurprised that people who really like this game are bad at social interaction.
[0:23:34] <Man_in_the_Red> if he's reading a wikia he might as well read the useless wall of text thats in game
[0:23:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat, maybe you should spend a day to research this game a bit before streaming
[0:23:36] <%Dunmarkh> what?
[0:23:39] <+FingaLights> omg did no one tell him about the in game tutorial??
[0:23:40] <SovPho> mood
[0:23:41] <+glgzephyr> there appears to be no difference with this game
[0:23:42] <samazam94> @owllightningmage i kinda want him to keep going tbh. drive all the kenshi fanatics insane lol
[0:23:42] <valhallandoates> u dont have to explain anything
[0:23:46] <%bevyrage> You're looking for a friend who knows the game helping you when prompted then?
[0:23:48] <Badgerconda_> What do you want, Pat? Just mess around in the game and explore. That's the only tutorial you need.
[0:23:51] <Broken_Sonex> It would seem these guides expect you to know the basics. Which you do not. @PatStaresAt
[0:23:52] <$RealThiele> we could be eating chicken RIGHT NOW
[0:23:54] <DetroitSentai> I just played it for 30 hours and enjoyed learning the systems, but that isnt for everyone by any means its super niche
[0:23:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is not going to like this game.
[0:23:59] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You are going to spend more time trying to figure out what to do that actually getting to do it
[0:24:01] <DudeDern> This is reminding me of when I tried to get into Runescape
[0:24:01] <YuongTiger> @PatStaresAt Did anyone need a guide for Skyrim? LUL
[0:24:02] <Orochi_Sheewa> This game is really unforgiving and doesn't tell you much, I don't think you'll enjoy streaming it
[0:24:05] <%blastyoboots> @FingaLights YOU'D BETTER BE KIDDING IS THERE REALLY AN IN GAME TUTORIAL
[0:24:08] <SovPho> just figure out bud
[0:24:09] <%JumboCrunchies> I just got here, what’s up? Did Pat not enjoy the game?
[0:24:09] <+glgzephyr> @Badgerconda_ Did you not just see the stream?
[0:24:09] <%walternatorz> but that's not fun so far.
[0:24:09] <+eanscrale> Is Outriders any good?
[0:24:11] <$RealThiele> LUL no
[0:24:12] <%DukeMoose> a lot of it is intuative that you figure out, but LP Tax and the chat low roar is going to ruin it. its not a streamable game B L I N D
[0:24:16] <tdm5wp> Is Swiss chalet any good or is it lame?
[0:24:17] <BliVru> @patstaresat FYI if you dont like not having objectives then dont olay Bannerlord
[0:24:18] <Teyaric> THATS CAUSE KENSHI IS A BAD GAME
[0:24:20] <s0nata_ii> then don't play the game
[0:24:20] <lambishly> YEAH that's kenshi, some people like that
[0:24:22] <+D00msDayDan> maybe this one just ain't it chief
[0:24:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Then that's the game, oh well
[0:24:24] <Ekaelis> Then its simple, not a game you'd enjoy
[0:24:24] <+ishouldfeelbad> good
[0:24:24] <%Agami23> @eanscrale pats stream of it looked fun at least
[0:24:24] <%Spydurman> Fortnite time?
[0:24:25] <KaiserMario> There's also no guarantee Pat will enjoy it more after putting the time and research
[0:24:25] <%Monkeyweed21> exactly
[0:24:26] <+hrudzie_1> why dont you just figure it out? gosh
[0:24:27] <+FingaLights> @blastyoboots yes LUL
[0:24:27] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat doesn't like the game
[0:24:28] <Fien111> You lack the proper goblins
[0:24:29] <+Jiggisnipe> you got jumped, that was pretty funny :)
[0:24:29] <%BoxNavy> unfortunately, that is the game it seems. appeals to a certain subset of people.
[0:24:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Then I guess it's not a good game?
[0:24:30] <cherrycottontail> It's kinda obvious this game wouldn't mesh with your brain goblins, I'm not sure why people recommended it. This game is totally a of a genre of games like Overgrowth or Dorf Fortress where a dev builds an engine that handles stuff that interests them, and you kind of have to have the desire to explore it's mechanics and find enjoyment your own way
[0:24:32] <+TungstenViper> EXPLORE. ...what's the objective and how do i get there?
[0:24:35] <+glgzephyr> GAME IS BAD, let's move on
[0:24:35] <tranquilturnip> then you mnight just not like it and that's fine
[0:24:35] <+PsychicExtremist> just play something else it just aint for you
[0:24:37] <%Dunmarkh> start as a party
[0:24:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Pat is lawful neutral, people
[0:24:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe it's just not a good game
[0:24:39] <ammobasket> Messing around is what got us here
[0:24:40] <ullyzeez> thats the game
[0:24:41] <$RealThiele> whip yourself until your brains is reshaped to accept it as fun
[0:24:41] <mouse_1312> that's fair, I   like the weird alien world and just wandering aimlessly
[0:24:41] <%Broand> "you can do it your way" isn't really a useful description of any game, Like you CAN play satisfactory by just making stuff by hand but it's not going to be fun
[0:24:42] <%MugenSandan> This is fighting game people telling everyone else to just shut up and play.
[0:24:43] <Madovir> chat is staring at a blank canvas saying "YOU JUST DON'T GET IT MAN"
[0:24:43] <+AnimationAtNight> THE FUN IS MAKING YOU OWN STORY, PLAY PRETEND
[0:24:45] <SovPho> @eanscrale my friend made this description: "This game feels like Great Value Destiny mixed with Sam's Choice Gears of War"
[0:24:47] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt It may not be a game for you, and thats cool.
[0:24:47] <%JoshManVGH> Kenshi: The Quest for Fun!
[0:24:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Can we move on to something else?
[0:24:51] <wolfen091> its too late folks, the fortnut has corrupted him
[0:24:51] <+OwlLightningMage> This is literally what I expected to happen. It's not for you Pat LUL
[0:24:51] <%backfire_shot> @SovPho I think its very similar to KC but with a more hands off tutorial it tells you things as it thinks you need them im not saying its a great tutorial but it does have one
[0:24:51] <s0nata_ii> game isn't bad it's just not for Pat
[0:24:51] <Man_in_the_Red> then i guess you just dont like the game
[0:24:51] <T_Sasquatch> THIS ISNT ABOUT GOLBINS, The game is fucked
[0:24:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> What gave you the incentive to play it in the first place @PatStaresAt ?
[0:24:52] <DetroitSentai> Given your diversion to make you own fun stuff like minecraft i dont think youd like this anyways
[0:24:53] <+WizoSavage> Automation and moving up in the world is enjoyable
[0:24:54] <plushy0> wing it
[0:24:54] <%ChaosVulpes> Answer!  PLAY SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY!  Not all games are for everyone, and this one is obviously not gonna click for ya Pat.
[0:24:55] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt I think its for people that like grinding, not fun
[0:24:56] <+archangel9889> Kenshi is a bad game period!!!!!!
[0:24:57] <doublemasteramerica> Everyone's got their preference's for games
[0:24:59] <+HoldenCasanova> It is hard to approach if you don't have a personal goal to work towards so I sympathize
[0:25:00] <+Despera__> the fun for me was being strong enough to explore further parts of the map and see all the weird cool shit
[0:25:02] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[0:25:05] <+Solutha> Kenshi and games like it you have put in some pain b4 fun
[0:25:05] <Iza_kku> the fun is in slowly building your stat points and gear up through the days, until that pack of bandits you feared you can now slaughter with 1 man
[0:25:07] <+FingaLights> Did no one point out the tutorial button in game? forget how useful it is @patstaresat
[0:25:08] <EuropanLamprey> You have to pick a goal yourself.  Become Thief, acquire loot, acquire bitches
[0:25:09] <samazam94> @dukemoose nothing about this game is intuitive, even after you get into the "good parts"
[0:25:09] <Bathezid> LUL
[0:25:10] <randomahole> "why do games have to be fun?" -chat
[0:25:10] <Badgerconda_> Ahh, okay. Maybe it's just not your thing, I dunno.  I think it's really goddamned fun, but it does take a little while to get going.
[0:25:12] <Blank9> they're crazy
[0:25:12] <Man_in_the_Red> gee i wonder why
[0:25:13] <%Dunmarkh> that's crazy
[0:25:14] <CollinsOfBodom> one community
[0:25:15] <DetroitSentai> did you watch his review?
[0:25:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt thats the game, its like playing Stalker with one of those survival overhauls
[0:25:16] <%BoxNavy> you got freakin pranked dude
[0:25:17] <%DukeMoose> its not a first stream blind without spoonfeeding
[0:25:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Werrrrrrd
[0:25:18] <+glgzephyr> why did you people ask for this
[0:25:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> @AnimationAtNight dude, you know who you're watching right??
[0:25:21] <Talbat> That review is old by now too
[0:25:21] <shubachi> that's your first mistake, listening to other people
[0:25:21] <%Daxalog> outriders midnight stream
[0:25:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Learning is the game
[0:25:22] <$RealThiele> this is pats snyder justice league moment
[0:25:24] <SovPho> @SovPho oh you know what, you're right when you start to encounter some systems it does pop tutorials up. It's been a bit.
[0:25:24] <DianaTheAscian> gosh a long time ago
[0:25:26] <Shinny1338> 2 years
[0:25:26] <sendart> No no you are supposed to stream the end game of Kenshi not the super boring early game LUL
[0:25:27] <BliVru> @patstaresat Did those people also tell you to play Evenicle?
[0:25:30] <Broken_Sonex> @Madovir THIS^
[0:25:31] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> mindgoblins
[0:25:32] <%walternatorz> there was nothing shown during that segment of gameplay that looked fun and it didn't look like anything fun was coming up
[0:25:32] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when you were a space junker? That was fun.
[0:25:33] <follyofjolly> Is this the fabled goblin stream where everything and everyone is goblins
[0:25:33] <tranquilturnip> Kenshi feels like the antithesis of a game pat would like, there's nothing wrong with that it just lacks the win conditions that pat seems to enjoy
[0:25:35] <%TheLakinessMonster> It's funny.
[0:25:35] <+OwlLightningMage> The game just isn't for Pat
[0:25:35] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like you have make your own goals but it'll take some time to get there
[0:25:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck those people. Why are you doing what people tell you to?
[0:25:36] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> have you seen his other reviews?
[0:25:36] <tdm5wp> Who is Seth?
[0:25:36] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Silly Pat, the more they cry about it, the more garbage their taste is, you should know this by now
[0:25:36] <+panlakes> I would have moved onto a different game 15 minutes ago
[0:25:36] <Siconia> One group of losers
[0:25:37] <jorniev> I think the most frustrating part for pat is that he is streaming, and therefore he has to hurry it up.
[0:25:37] <Giztech> ever heard of Vagante? side scrolling dungeon crawler.
[0:25:38] <+glgzephyr> People in chat saying he slept through parts of the review LUL
[0:25:38] <iq_dropper> You might need to downgrade your goblins to an older version
[0:25:39] <alter_eagle> The fun for me is the exciting world building band cool locations
[0:25:41] <+GarouFGC> Kenshi is def not a stream friendly game thats for sure. That game takes many, many hours to actually get anywhere in.
[0:25:41] <dereksbales> in the review he says it sucks
[0:25:42] <+HoldenCasanova> I would say Kenshi is a game in the same way Pathologic is a game
[0:25:46] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt @FingaLights Is saying there's an in-game tutorial under the Tutorial Button that apparently NOBODY ELSE in chat bothered to tell you about
[0:25:46] <Bathezid> the kenshi community is toxic atpRtsd
[0:25:49] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt  play pathfinder kingmaker instead
[0:25:51] <Them00n> @patstaresat for me at least the fun comes from slowly building up a character from shit all but i know it's not every bodies thing
[0:25:52] <crabmeat495> Finally a game where we can share mind goblins
[0:25:54] <jorniev> wow chat
[0:25:55] <%GarbageNirvana> I came to Kenshi completely independent of that review and came to the conclusion that it was a game I could get into if I had absolutely no other games I wanted or could play
[0:25:55] <Ekaelis> When Cohh streamed it it was a slow burn but it wasn't boring
[0:25:56] <+TungstenViper> this is getting out of hand NotLikeThis
[0:25:57] <chili_nobeans> oh no pat gave up
[0:25:58] <Man_in_the_Red> but yeah, listening to Sseth's audiance in particular was a mistake
[0:26:00] <%TheLakinessMonster> It does also end in a God Hand Outro. That music is bait.
[0:26:00] <+Flambage> I love kenshi but never did I think that watching Pat play it would be a good idea
[0:26:03] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:26:03] <balthazar758> we are definitely not bussin
[0:26:03] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:26:05] <%JoshManVGH> .........
[0:26:06] <ullyzeez> @blivru LUL
[0:26:07] <+triumphantapostle> i almost wish you could voice chat with someone about the game about the design stuff in it
[0:26:07] <+glgzephyr> @OwlLightningMage This game appears to be not for the vast majority of people
[0:26:08] <%Dunmarkh> That's just the text tutorials
[0:26:09] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt its ok if youre not interested
[0:26:10] <xeros720> wait, it has a tutorial? i thought it was a wiki game
[0:26:10] <Man_in_the_Red> case in point, ive been a Patreon for a year now
[0:26:12] <+TheMorilo> OH MY GOD
[0:26:12] <cheapdoc> I love how people are using survival overhauls as examples. Those are things that are inserted into the game after people fucking master them
[0:26:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> C'mon man
[0:26:13] <Louie_Salmon> @Giztech Vagante is so niche, I didn't think anyone knew about it other than me.
[0:26:13] <+TungstenViper> wow
[0:26:13] <+Goshism> Fun for people that have the time to get into it and don’t stream
[0:26:14] <Broken_Sonex> WHAT?! FUCK OFF CHAT
[0:26:14] <Zebroneath> oh boy
[0:26:17] <Visorak6> HERE WE GO

[0:26:18] <+TungstenViper> LUL
[0:26:18] <T_Sasquatch> @HoldenCasanova brudda o/ thank you for calling out that other weird ass game
[0:26:19] <$TallYoda08> atpRtsd atpCap atpRtsd atpCap
[0:26:20] <%Dunmarkh> those come up automatically
[0:26:22] <Shinny1338> lol its just those pop up tutorials in a list
[0:26:22] <+OwlLightningMage> I wish Pat would give up. Pat you've done enough stop trying to get it LUL
[0:26:23] <Aydarkzero> ?
[0:26:23] <%BoxNavy> that cant be real
[0:26:24] <+glgzephyr> @xeros720 It appears to be a wiki game
[0:26:26] <RWLJr98> I never played this
[0:26:26] <%BubbaRands> Wait! Is there a Tutorial for the Tutorial?! LUL
[0:26:27] <jorniev> If you didn't like it you didn't like it that's all
[0:26:27] <$RealThiele> LUL this outta be good
[0:26:27] <%sleeplessmetro> Are you fucking serious?
[0:26:28] <Zeldrick> Oh no, if that's true....
[0:26:29] <%bassoontyphoon> ohgodwhyohgdowhyohgodwhy
[0:26:29] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Chat no
[0:26:29] <Iza_kku> did no one tell him that?
[0:26:31] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You didn't
[0:26:32] <%JuliusGemstone> @patstaresat sorry to see everyone freaking out about this thing pat. a honest suggestion is you could try another one of the senerious to see if they strike your fancy a little better, but this really might not be the game for you. to each their own after all!
[0:26:33] <NeonBleu> I'm guessing chat hasn't actually played it LUL
[0:26:33] <Giztech> @Louie_Salmon i think pat might like it
[0:26:34] <Fien111> When Pat plays Dorfort eventually he's gonna just hate us all
[0:26:34] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I definately think you would need to collab with someone to get the full experience out of this one sadly.
[0:26:35] <ullyzeez> LETS GOOOOOOOO
[0:26:37] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Is it with the risk of damage to your TV though?
[0:26:37] <SovPho> lol no it's just a tutorials checkbox in settings
[0:26:38] <%sleeplessmetro> This better not be a fucking prank
[0:26:38] <+TungstenViper> pls let this be real LUL
[0:26:39] <%Dunmarkh> you already saw those
[0:26:40] <Meltgar> I didn't expect that
[0:26:40] <+Goshism> Nuuuuuuuu I don’t like where this is going
[0:26:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> @OwlLightningMage He'll do what he wants
[0:26:44] <doublemasteramerica> Considering the way i've seen how you tend to play games & what you enjoy it seems like a game you'd need to slam some hours in to get over the curve; and that's just to find out if you enjoy it.
[0:26:44] <%backfire_shot> I usually lurk and do other things so i just assumed you were doing pat things of hey imma just see what it do
[0:26:47] <Bamcrash> @Louie_Salmon Vagante is great
[0:26:49] <Broken_Sonex> Chat.........

[0:29:01] <SovPho> masochism
[0:29:01] <+MillerLowlife> is there a single person in here who has actually played kenshi and not just watched a video on it
[0:29:03] <%spitelite> this doesn't seem fun
[0:29:03] <+seoliart> I like this game but you really shouldn't play it Pat LUL
[0:29:04] <blackbaron98> You dont have to
[0:29:04] <HeroToxiko> no fucking way LUL woolieONEGUY
[0:29:05] <+triumphantapostle> have a podcast guest lul
[0:29:05] <+PsychicExtremist> That's fine you don't need to, not every game's for you
[0:29:07] <+GarouFGC> You don't have to like the things other people like Pat.
[0:29:07] <Fien111> And we're very sorry, we're wierd assholes
[0:29:08] <+Goshism> Different strokes for different folks
[0:29:08] <CollinsOfBodom> disco disco disco disco
[0:29:10] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt  you might someday understand kenshi if you play soemthing like mount and blade first
[0:29:10] <krnksk> Same
[0:29:10] <DetroitSentai> Its fine if you dont understand, people like Tales games and AC games and i dont get that
[0:29:11] <Meltgar> BRIGHT
[0:29:11] <+TungstenViper> So... let me get this straight. the player is supposed to read ALL that just to start the game? LUL
[0:29:12] <%MechArch> live stream uninstall
[0:29:12] <T_Sasquatch> Yea fuck them , you dont need to understand insanity
[0:29:12] <+WizoSavage> Keep playing:?
[0:29:13] <+ItalianWaifu> i have 171 hours in it
[0:29:13] <fatlystackedmac> this game was made by one dude over 12 years yall who like this are just bizarre
[0:29:13] <DudeDern> ! STREAM AT RISK !
[0:29:13] <%ChaosVulpes> Some people love crystal meth!  But it's not for everyone... or anyone really. :D
[0:29:13] <%BoxNavy> no ones gonna kill you for not liking it. theyre just gonna bug you on twitter like usual
[0:29:14] <Ekaelis> Might need to watch Sseth review again to get it LUL
[0:29:15] <SovPho> the same folks that don't think Dark Souls needs an easy mode kappa
[0:29:16] <Manwad> @MillerLowlife No.
[0:29:16] <%bassoontyphoon> disco?
[0:29:16] <Siconia> Unfortunately those people are here, actively ruining it
[0:29:17] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[0:29:17] <samazam94> just call them dum dums
[0:29:17] <+topiodonk> wasnt pat talking on twitter about how people cant read? Kappa
[0:29:19] <+archangel9889> Pat just forget this game. let them have there bad game.
[0:29:20] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Just press the abort button
[0:29:20] <s1rcuit> @AzureSkyKnight Pat is trying and failing to get the fun of Kenshi
[0:29:20] <shinichizio> Game's weird, film at 11
[0:29:20] <+panlakes> By this point you know this game is not for you - are you looking for validation that it sucks or alternatives to play?
[0:29:21] <RyuuAoi> Pat, I'm late!  Can you start over?!
[0:29:22] <%GarbageNirvana> There are people who also enjoy getting kicked in the balls and I don't understand that either, it's just how they're wired
[0:29:22] <Aydarkzero> i can respect that
[0:29:22] <ghoulspan> Its not for you Pat, thats fine
[0:29:23] <Giztech> probally best to try it off stream
[0:29:24] <Blank9> I didn't know about the game and that looked awful
[0:29:25] <+HoldenCasanova> Honestly it is one of my favorite games I am not joking
[0:29:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt You don't need to understand other people's reasons for enjoying things
[0:29:26] <+hrudzie_1> lets just play something else
[0:29:26] <%walternatorz> the most extreme level of delayed satisfaction
[0:29:26] <%MidnightBurst12> some people have more patience for the initial grind
[0:29:26] <ullyzeez> GET SSETH ON THE PODCAST
[0:29:27] <BTR_NOODLE> @MillerLowlife yes hello, the game is great :)
[0:29:29] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Just say it's not for you and never touch it again.
[0:29:29] <%Dunmarkh> @MillerLowlife 189 hours dude
[0:29:29] <Bathezid> i think most people these days haven't even played it and just know it from memey youtube videos atpCap
[0:29:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> You do'nt have to understand tho
[0:29:30] <illTemperedSeaBass> Holy shit. I have NEVER seen a game as heavily anti-sold as the dickheads in chat screaming "jUsT dO tHe ThInG!11!1!" right now.
[0:29:30] <blackbaron98> You dont have to understand everything
[0:29:32] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt I don't blame you, it's just one of those games you don't like, again it's the open ended nature of the game that drew me into it
[0:29:33] <%BoxNavy> backgammon sucks and is for idiots
[0:29:33] <%BubbaRands> That's okay Pat. People like different things
[0:29:33] <%sleeplessmetro> Sorry about all this Pat
[0:29:33] <iq_dropper> just cheat pat
[0:29:34] <Them00n> @patstaresat it takes a certain kind of personality that enjoys slowly building up from shit nothing
[0:29:35] <ihatemylifeitsux> Kenshi is amazing but uhhh maybe not streamer friendly if your new to it
[0:29:36] <Dommykins> i feel like chat has done everything it can to ruin the shot for you tbh
[0:29:37] <+triumphantapostle> you should do voice chat with someone whol likes the game
[0:29:38] <$RealThiele> CBT LOVERS ASSOCIATION APPROVED GAME
[0:29:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's okay to not understand something
[0:29:39] <+OwlLightningMage> I unironcally love this game
[0:29:41] <mouse_1312> cos us kenshi fans are all masochistic weirdos
[0:29:41] <JetpackMcQuack> The 20th hour gets really good
[0:29:42] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> same reason people like dwarf fortress
[0:29:43] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt I hope it didn't sound like I was advocating this game, I don't think you'll like it it's just @FingaLights insisted there was a tutorial when it was just two entries in that big tutorial list saying "What do I do?".
[0:29:43] <Clundy> Forget Kenshi exists, live a better life Pat
[0:29:44] <T_Sasquatch> there are many things that arent possible to understand
[0:29:45] <EuropanLamprey> People like the directionless freedom
[0:29:46] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:29:48] <Visorak6> Can we make this a fortnite stream to not end the night on a bummer note?
[0:29:48] <+Terikatown> you should do a super best friends-like with them. you can talk shit while they play and we'll all be high on nostalgia watching you be frustrated
[0:29:49] <tranquilturnip> would rather chew on nails
[0:29:50] <+glgzephyr> they're delusional
[0:29:50] <+karilotl> i love kenshi and pat is 100% correct. i bought and started playing the game because i realized i could pick up progressively heavier corpses and run around like some psychotic weightlifter. i named my character STRUNGUS and made BONEDOG a personal bed. then i slowly practiced theft to survive until i could start emptying out a town. for days i followed one shop owner that got me arrested early and would just knock him out when nobody was looking
[0:29:51] <+DiscouragedOblong> Tbh I found Morrowind harder to learn than kenshi personally
[0:29:52] <RyuuAoi> What is Pat even playing tonight?
[0:29:54] <blackbaron98> ohh Spicy
[0:29:55] <Jontman42> cool
[0:29:55] <xeros720> yeah, pat has factory games
[0:29:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ignore it and move on
[0:29:56] <%Reveresao> LUL
[0:29:56] <Luizabd> You where just on twitter complaining about the guy not reading the tutorial
[0:29:57] <%Macguffn> I came in at the exact right time here
[0:29:57] <+Rekinsinn> Would you believe the play experience changes after you've learned more about what you can do?
[0:29:58] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I'd suggest you don't even mention this to Woolie so you won't get people mad LUL
[0:29:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat will literally never play this game again LUL
[0:29:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> He doesn't have time for that?
[0:29:59] <Zebroneath> Understanding "the hook" is something I want to find out for games I don't enjoy
[0:30:00] <xeros720> and fortnite
[0:30:01] <Shinny1338> No worries man. You would need a good 5-6 hour session to just mess around. I haven't played for awhile because to me the beginning is the least fun part
[0:30:02] <%bassoontyphoon> @PatStaresAt Kenshi is like a solo MMO that is built off of pure unbridled jank
[0:30:03] <%sleeplessmetro> Yeah I dont see you doing that after this shit hole
[0:30:04] <%backfire_shot> @PatStaresAt Its the world and the people of the game that we enjoy
[0:30:05] <Stigmergy> Pat are you sure you still enjoy video games
[0:30:05] <+Solutha> Someon who wants to be fair?
[0:30:07] <+HoldenCasanova> It is not so much a game as it is a simulation
[0:30:11] <Badgerconda_> Those games aren't directionless Pat
[0:30:13] <$RealThiele> pat is staring at mind goblins and chat ones
[0:30:13] <Orochi_Sheewa> @PatStaresAt do you have a friend that play, that can guide you?
[0:30:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Learning this game is stream-poison. It unfortunately needs a good chunk of time where you can just try stuff.
[0:30:14] <SovPho> The game gets its charm from surprisingly deep systems. There are notable reputations that just happen over time, there are hatreds that literally can't be overcome and there are actual political things happening between factions in the game.
[0:30:14] <ammobasket> “Mmmmm, homework!”
[0:30:18] <danteftw20> Tell me pat, What is best in life?
[0:30:18] <%Broand> But not all games aren't going to have endings
[0:30:18] <ihatemylifeitsux> Its really jank but amazing kinda liikeee uh morrowind if you can handle it these days
[0:30:19] <BliVru> @patstaresat If you dont like this types of games with no objective than you wont like BANNERLORD
[0:30:19] <CollinsOfBodom> shit going on
[0:30:20] <Badgerconda_> Those games are rigid story based RPGs that happen to be open world
[0:30:21] <Siconia> Stuff
[0:30:21] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you given any thought to playing IT Takes Two with Paige?
[0:30:22] <worldbrand> honestly i understand that suggestion because i would assume it takes the pressure off
[0:30:22] <ullyzeez> thSd game is gonna get refunded LUL
[0:30:23] <+glgzephyr> those games aren't directionless, though LUL
[0:30:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> Content
[0:30:23] <RWLJr98> a starting point
[0:30:23] <%ssjklyco> Mini goals
[0:30:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Those games aren't directionless
[0:30:26] <blackbaron98> Those game arnt like this game
[0:30:27] <MajesticDoogle> those games aren't directionless lmao
[0:30:27] <Siconia> There was content
[0:30:27] <TheA1ternative> yes it has
[0:30:27] <FunkyTK> Those games had a direction
[0:30:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt those arent sandboxes
[0:30:28] <%DukeMoose> I'm just surprised you didn't talk to a friend that played kenshi for their impression
[0:30:29] <+panlakes> I grew up with Morrowind - it has way more direction than Kenshi fuck off lol LUL
[0:30:29] <+glgzephyr> They hide it REAL WELL
[0:30:29] <%BubbaRands> "Content"
[0:30:30] <%walternatorz> there's nothing to compel you to advance from what was shown
[0:30:32] <RyuuAoi> Pat played Fornite for our souls to be saved. Love him
[0:30:32] <%Broand> Not all games have endings technically
[0:30:33] <%Dunmarkh> you went to one town and lost two fights
[0:30:34] <SovPho> Unfortunately the charm is super lost whenever you as a character can't experience any of that shit because fuck you you're probably gonna end up a slave.
[0:30:35] <+triumphantapostle> voice chatting with someone about it who knows the game might help
[0:30:36] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt it's building an army and starting a nation
[0:30:37] <DetroitSentai> new vegas is pretty rigid it just has exploragtion
[0:30:37] <+TungstenViper> Chat, you're not getting it. it's not about not liking it. it's about the game being super non-user friendly and being obtuse. also not having a clear goal
[0:30:39] <$RealThiele> the fun is just 20 hours in!
[0:30:40] <+topiodonk> pat doing a kotaku LUL
[0:30:40] <%BoxNavy> those games breadcrumb you a little though
[0:30:40] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt One way to look at it then is that people like me who love it have forgotten the WALL of fuck-you the early game is, instead we just latch on to the crazy world, lore, and the base-building and power-tripping.
[0:30:43] <Them00n> Pat doesn't like mount n blade either
[0:30:44] <cheapdoc> Don't believe them
[0:30:46] <Luizabd> Why would ppl lie about that?
[0:30:49] <Badgerconda_> Pat, it's not like NV.
[0:30:51] <+HoldenCasanova> The game doesn't have interesting conversations so whoever said they did was lying
[0:30:51] <Broken_Sonex> I DON'T BELIVE ANY OF CHAT
[0:30:51] <xeros720> i thought this game had a goal you can pick, didn't know people were making d&d campaigns in their mind
[0:30:52] <cheapdoc> never believe fans of games
[0:30:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Those games aren't directionless
[0:30:56] <cherrycottontail> There's a couple YT videos which go through the whole process of their goal. Maybe try watching the "Training of One Punch Man" videos or "Solo Torso" something. Sseth videos' are cancerous depictions of video games, in terms of experience.
[0:30:58] <jorniev> i see bunch of people who like the game and totally agree with pat
[0:30:59] <Badgerconda_> It's more like Mount and Blade (which I think you also didn't get?)
[0:31:00] <Orenjevel> eventually the guards punch you so hard you unlock dialogue?
[0:31:00] <+ItalianWaifu> fight shit get stronger try not to die is the gameplay
[0:31:01] <+panlakes> Just play Morrowind lol
[0:31:01] <%blastyoboots> baaaaaaaaadly designed in that regard
[0:31:03] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so whats gonna be the rest of the stream? fortinte?
[0:31:03] <+FingaLights> @blastyoboots :( i was sure there was, I remeber o e years back that told you things to do at the begining
[0:31:05] <KingFatality> @PatStaresAt building an army and starting a nation is a LONG grind and the game reminds you that a lot
[0:31:08] <+OwlLightningMage> It's just not for Pat
[0:31:08] <DetroitSentai> Wait pat doesnt like M&B, that explains it
[0:31:09] <%bassoontyphoon> anywaysssss
[0:31:10] <TheA1ternative> There are very memorable characters with unique dialogue in kenshi
[0:31:11] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt
[0:31:11] <T_Sasquatch> don't believe their liesss
[0:31:12] <RyuuAoi> Pat, you just were it listening.
[0:31:12] <JetpackMcQuack> This game is so complicated (eventually)
[0:31:13] <+lag2993> thank you for taking this bullet for me now ive lost interest
[0:31:15] <BliVru> Seriously dont worry about it it just wasnt for him
[0:31:15] <+glgzephyr> @Them00n Man, I've put 300 hours into the M&B franchise and that series puts this garbage to shame
[0:31:16] <RyuuAoi> Not
[0:31:17] <Shinny1338> There's not a Huge amount of unique NPC's not sure why people were saying thay
[0:31:17] <Gabintzky> Kenshi is strange. You can in fact find unique npcs, and there are fights and things to actually explore, but they are very spaced out and you are not given directions.
[0:31:17] <@SoFarFetched> could do more disco
[0:31:19] <+Despera__> Disco
[0:31:19] <blackbaron98> we dont care
[0:31:19] <$RealThiele> disco coming back?
[0:31:21] <+Goshism> You do your own dialogue. It’s ultimate role play!
[0:31:21] <T_Sasquatch> fuck them LUL
[0:31:22] <Siconia> Disco?
[0:31:22] <%Macguffn> Evil Genius 2 just release
[0:31:23] <kenny_biff> NO FORTNITE
[0:31:23] <Iza_kku> this game is more fun with things like recruit prisoners mod, so get characters that have higher stats and just cheese the early game
[0:31:24] <%Agami23> they deserve to be disappointed
[0:31:24] <DianaTheAscian> BUT IT WOULD BE FUNNY
[0:31:24] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt one more go until death?
[0:31:26] <+FallenAngelSC2> Play more Rise
[0:31:26] <CollinsOfBodom> disco disco disco disco disco
[0:31:27] <YuongTiger> @PatStaresAt those games also had a basic plot and an overall goal for the protagonist.
[0:31:27] <%Monkeyweed21> D I S C O
[0:31:28] <dragoon001914> I showed up for Kenshi but I wouldn't mind Fortnite
[0:31:29] <LunarRemix> Are you feeling down?
[0:31:30] <%king_wragles> Fuck it, do more Disco
[0:31:30] <ullyzeez> what we doin know??
[0:31:31] <Meltgar> LUL
[0:31:32] <%toastybites> they're already disappointed lol
[0:31:32] <lambishly> I don't blame you for hating it pat it's okay
[0:31:32] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> f*ck em, play what you want
[0:31:33] <%bassoontyphoon> disco disco disco
[0:31:33] <%DukeMoose> I mean did you want to be spoonfed and told to Go Blank and left and Up the stairs to talk to the guy to get this lore dump
[0:31:34] <%sabertoothzombie> Disco!
[0:31:35] <kappacino2020> NO MORE FORTNITE
[0:31:35] <+Aleate> So Apex then Kappa
[0:31:36] <BliVru> @patstaresat How about Evil Genius 2?
[0:31:36] <%Spydurman> dISCO?
[0:31:36] <shubachi> disco
[0:31:36] <SovPho> It's more like top-down Kingdom Come imo
[0:31:37] <+CookieCutter007> THAT'S THE BEST PART
[0:31:37] <%sleeplessmetro> Stop trying to convince him guys, his mind's pretty set on it impression wise.
[0:31:37] <devanmuse> Wait, are you ALREADY finished with Kenshi?
[0:31:37] <+ItalianWaifu> got to use javlins
[0:31:37] <Shinny1338> lol
[0:31:38] <xeros720> yeah fuck it, play Rise
[0:31:38] <DirtyMiser> People who came in for Kenshi are already displeased. Just play what you wanna play
[0:31:38] <Fien111> Yeah, taht's M&B alright
[0:31:38] <thepardack> The people that showed up for Kenshi also seem to be a pain in the butt.
[0:31:39] <%ospreyworks> weird, pat's stream is skipping and repeating a lot for me, but no one else I follow on twitch is having the same issues.
[0:31:39] <$SGrim> why not factorio?
[0:31:39] <+lag2993> new binding of isaac dlc
[0:31:39] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:31:40] <cheapdoc> but it had a tutorial
[0:31:40] <$lotharrio> Loop Hero feels like it'd be up Pat's alley.
[0:31:41] <Orenjevel> AI dungeon or something lol
[0:31:41] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt what about more Rimworld? people who came for Kenshi wouldn't be disappointed by that?
[0:31:41] <KaiserMario> Feeling Disco tonight?
[0:31:41] <%Dunmarkh> factorio?
[0:31:42] <$RealThiele> empathy you fuck i need you
[0:31:43] <+glgzephyr> that's about right
[0:31:44] <%BinaryFireball> then kenshi is not something you can enjoy haha
[0:31:45] <+hrudzie_1> disco seems cool
[0:31:45] <Badgerconda_> Pat has bad taste confirmed
[0:31:46] <lambishly> Everyone I know hates it but I like it and that's okay
[0:31:47] <%ssjklyco> Its the Sonic Jump factor
[0:31:47] <+topiodonk> its a make your own adventure game, if you just want follow a quest marker this aint for you really
[0:31:48] <Fien111> Fair, that's fair, pat
[0:31:49] <+Goshism> Streets of rogue. One of these days he’ll play that
[0:31:49] <samazam94> congratulations, kenshi fanatics, you have successfully anti-sold the game to pat. bra-fucking-vo
[0:31:50] <Mr_Rakjo> @PatStaresAt battle brothers is turn base mount and blade and its fun
[0:31:50] <AlexandusLordOfChaos> Loop Hero!
[0:31:51] <+panlakes> Morrowind lol
[0:31:51] <%walternatorz> just play with Gief
[0:31:51] <%DukeMoose> then you also skimmed several lore stuffs
[0:31:51] <%bassoontyphoon> Off to Revachol???
[0:31:52] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt This game makes Morrowind look like a cakewalk.
[0:31:52] <ThirdPersonPhil> Really? What is so wrong about the arrows?
[0:31:52] <%king_wragles> The people who REALLY like Kenshi just get that people bounce off it SUPER hard
[0:31:52] <Manwad> The factory must grow
[0:31:53] <BliVru> Evil genius 2?
[0:31:53] <Them00n> @glgzephyr have you actually played kenshi?
[0:31:53] <dragoon001914> @PatStaresAt Get that #1 Victory Royale
[0:31:54] <bonebagMEL> In general, Kenshi goes "live in this shit hole" so... "survive" it's kind of the objective, but it too wide for me
[0:31:54] <+PenmanLupine> Darkhorse Suggestion: Some Satisfactory maybe?
[0:31:55] <%BinaryFireball> factorio!
[0:31:55] <+fetrigon> Oh ok he was never gonna like kenshi LUL
[0:31:55] <Imbetweenjobs_> disco elysium got that big update
[0:31:55] <%NoirePanzer> NoirePanzer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! psaDogchamp
[0:31:55] <+alpharius88> EVIL GENIUS is kinda in the same genere?
[0:31:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's like mount and blade but more obtuse and jank which is really impressive honestly
[0:31:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Did you watch Godzilla VS Kong yett?
[0:31:57] <hermitdab> FN poggger
[0:31:57] <quadwadd> diSCO
[0:31:57] <%backfire_shot> I think getting someone who has played the game a significant amount on a voice chat will help explain the game more than the 6 IQ that is the collective that is chat
[0:31:58] <Fien111> M&B is shit, and I love it
[0:31:58] <Dommykins> try Battlebrothers, it's an open world game with ttrpg elements.
[0:32:00] <plushy0> blue fire?
[0:32:00] <%JamesJaystar> Monster Hunter?
[0:32:01] <%blastyoboots> Rimworld is close enough to Kenshi to cross hop into maybe
[0:32:02] <ullyzeez> play another wierd game!!
[0:32:02] <%BoxNavy> peepee
[0:32:02] <lambishly> Isaac?
[0:32:03] <+OwlLightningMage> I got actually the reaction to Kenshi I wanted from Pat. There was no chance he would like it or get it LUL
[0:32:03] <%BubbaRands> Pat, you could play Solitaire And i'd be down
[0:32:03] <RyuuAoi> Pull something from the Porn Box? Or did Matt take that in the divorce?
[0:32:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Play Backgammon
[0:32:05] <%dekkitout> Got any machines or whatev you wanted to build in your other games
[0:32:05] <yourliteraldog> To be fair I wanted to see you try and you did. Hopefully cool people in chat feel the same way
[0:32:05] <Capn_Trips> Fortnut
[0:32:06] <%sleeplessmetro> Take a break man
[0:32:07] <+Kitrane> I normally dislike Fortnite but watching you play it actually has a enjoyable qaulity that dedicated fortnite streamers dont have
[0:32:08] <samazam94> more MH?
[0:32:08] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt how about checking out that Galahad
[0:32:11] <%bassoontyphoon> Chocolate DIsco???
[0:32:11] <+glgzephyr> @Them00n No, and I absolutely never will now
[0:32:11] <ToneBacas> fortnite
[0:32:12] <Meltgar> KENSHI? More like Ken-out of here
[0:32:13] <devanmuse> I was away for less than an hour. Was Kenshi THAT bad!?
[0:32:13] <%Reaped_Psyche> UNO
[0:32:13] <%THATGUY_789> Dragons Dogma
[0:32:13] <$RealThiele> disco rise or nutt
[0:32:15] <+TungstenViper> NotLikeThis
[0:32:16] <seth45er> RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD RIM WORLD
[0:32:16] <Clundy> Battle brothers would be good
[0:32:16] <BliVru> WELL CHAT I HOPE YOUR ARE PROUD
[0:32:17] <jorniev> I Liked mount and blade and i agree
[0:32:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> dump ass get
[0:32:19] <yourliteraldog> Bean Dad Chat
[0:32:23] <+Aleate> SourPls
[0:32:24] <ullyzeez> play another sseth game
[0:32:28] <T_Sasquatch> Chat imagine being pat and having a 100 people like mallet boy talk shit.
[0:32:30] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wait are we not ending?
[0:32:30] <$RealThiele> goblin overloaded
[0:32:30] <owazowski> But paaaaat video game
[0:32:32] <%JuliusGemstone> welp
[0:32:34] <+ScottishMadJacko> Kenshi seems trash
[0:32:35] <%BoxNavy> kenshiz nuts
[0:32:37] <DianaTheAscian> that might have been the worst first impression I've seen Pat have for a game
[0:32:38] <Louie_Salmon> Oooooh he should stream the new isaac expansion
[0:32:38] <yourliteraldog> Kamidori ALchemy
[0:32:39] <iosephe> Dwarf Fortress (no)
[0:32:39] <+panlakes> This is why Twitch sucks, you can't just let a man play a game and let his enjoyment be the entertainment. Yall gotta fucking punish the shit out of him for LUL
[0:32:39] <+OwlLightningMage> I love Kenshi and I knew this was going to happen
[0:32:42] <Badgerconda_> I think Pat just doesn't get games that don't give him clear and direct goals to achieve... it's like an OCD thing maybe?
[0:32:42] <%BinaryFireball> kenshi is a jank nerd game made by a jank nerd
[0:32:43] <balthazar758> womp womp
[0:32:44] <BliVru> @ullyzeez Evenicle?
[0:32:44] <+Despera__> lol pat trying Caves of Qud
[0:32:44] <aiutare47> Kenshi left Pat even more confused and scared than he started
[0:32:45] <@SoFarFetched> As a reminder,please don't be an ass to pat when trying to explain things to him.
[0:32:46] <Them00n> @glgzephyr your loss I guess
[0:32:51] <Meltgar> Pat plays PLOK, a GOOD game Kappa
[0:32:54] <lambishly> I saw this coming a mile away
[0:32:55] <follyofjolly> I like Kenshi, but I can't recommend it easily. Also holy FUCK this is the worst I've seen chat in my time being here. NotLikeThis
[0:32:58] <Ekaelis> Its funny that on one end you have Pat opinion, and on the other Sseth review who has only praise for the game.
[0:32:59] <penitentpendant> @devanmuse Yes. Then chat double down on Bean Dadding and made it worse.
[0:32:59] <+Kitrane> I just like the fact that despite him not understanding he gave it a better shake than a lot of people that try it.
[0:33:00] <ape_hawk> YO GODZILLA VS KONG WAS AWESOME AND HYPE AF!!!
[0:33:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kenshi doesn't look like there's much game.
[0:33:02] <jorniev> kenshi is good JANK
[0:33:06] <DudeDern> What other games could go horribly?
[0:33:08] <Broken_Sonex> Today Chat was the Bean Dad.
[0:33:08] <crabmeat495> Didn't plague check out kenshi at one point?
[0:33:09] <xeros720> it's like you took a fallout game and just kept modding it and modding it and modding it until it became the ship of theseus
[0:33:09] <+karilotl> @BinaryFireball speaking as a jank nerd, agreed
[0:33:11] <+glgzephyr> @Them00n Nah I got a backlog with tons of games that will actually provide me with entertainment
[0:33:14] <aiutare47> @OwlLightningMage yeah, its not for him. Thats cool. its not a game that can be described really.
[0:33:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat had zero chance of enjoying this game. This is exactly what I wanted LUL
[0:33:18] <%BubbaRands> Pat should play Super Seducer Kappa
[0:33:20] <iq_dropper> @yourliteraldog yo I'm playing that rn it's great
[0:33:22] <%BinaryFireball> it is GOOD jank
[0:33:22] <blackbaron98> @rumtumtugnutz have you played it enough to know?
[0:33:23] <samazam94> @t_sasquatch mallet boys. i like that. can that be an official term?
[0:33:25] <RyuuAoi> Pat should play...CYBERPUNK
[0:33:26] <+GarouFGC> I also love Kenshi and could see this happening from miles away. Its not a stream friendly game. and its confusing as hell starting out.
[0:33:28] <owazowski> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:29] <Broken_Sonex> @OwlLightningMage This game makes Morrowind look like a cakewalk.
[0:33:34] <Bathezid> yeah i didn't see many people being very kind or helpful when trying to tell pat what to do. not a very good look or way to get someone to play your favorite game LUL
[0:33:34] <+topiodonk> its just really funny pat going a rant on twitter about people who cant read and then this happens
[0:33:36] <Badgerconda_> Kenshi is jank as fuck, but it's also a blast if you're the kind of person that actually has an imagination
[0:33:39] <jorniev> @Ekaelis sseth does love a bunch of old ass jank games
[0:33:43] <AzureSkyKnight> Is Kenshi just Minecraft?
[0:33:48] <%ChaosVulpes> I am loving this 'BE RIGHT BACK' screen though.  This is great!
[0:33:50] <devanmuse> @penitentpendant Bean Dadding as in "Wait, no, you're not playing it right" or "We're not going to tell you what to do, figure it out yourself"?
[0:33:53] <T_Sasquatch> @AzureSkyKnight no
[0:33:55] <Aydarkzero> @topiodonk that's crazy talk for ya
[0:33:57] <+TungstenViper> also chat, please stop acting like needing to watch a video to udnerstand what to basic things in a game is normal behavior
[0:33:58] <%BinaryFireball> I was really surprised he chose it, thats why I asked if there was a big update to it
[0:34:05] <Meltgar> @AzureSkyKnight I wouldn't call it exactly minecraft
[0:34:10] <Badgerconda_> Kenshi is like top down Mount and Blade combined with the Sims and also weab trash.
[0:34:12] <follyofjolly> @rumtumtugnutz theres is a game to it, but until you learn how the systems work its not super easy to crack it open.
[0:34:12] <penitentpendant> @devanmuse Both.
[0:34:12] <+glgzephyr> @topiodonk Pretty sure that not reading had nothing to do with this game's reception
[0:34:13] <+Despera__> Kenshi you have to fuck around with and fail for 5 hours before you start progressing
[0:34:16] <Madovir> @penitentpendant both
[0:34:18] <Broken_Sonex> @penitentpendant Bit of both honestly
[0:34:19] <%backfire_shot> Easily the most toxic ive seen chat in a long time people actively trying to help pat understand why we enjoy the game and others actively calling the game shit on every occasion they can get
[0:34:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> @blackbaron98 I've played enough of it to know that I don't enjoy it.
[0:34:20] <%bapposbungers> Oh, Chat! Can someone ask Pat if he enjoyed Disco Elysium voice acting? I missed the stream and I'm going to bed..
[0:34:22] <Them00n> chat was pretty shit tonight
[0:34:22] <tdm5wp> Let’s play nethack
[0:34:23] <+karilotl> kenshi is like minecraft if there was never a game designer involved in minecraft, every zombie could kill you in three hits, and before you built a single block you usually needed a few days to learn how to carry blocks
[0:34:24] <Ekaelis> @jorniev there's more freedom and creativity to them, its unlike today generic 3d action adventure rpgs
[0:34:25] <blackbaron98> @TungstenViper is kenshi a normal game?
[0:34:25] <DudeDern> Has pat ever played minecraft on stream?
[0:34:26] <+fetrigon> @AzureSkyKnight no
[0:34:30] <yourliteraldog> We gotta keep in mind Sseth is actually kind of insane and a shit poster
[0:34:30] <Shinny1338> @azureskyknight not really. more like an open ended RTS
[0:34:32] <+Kitrane> what the fuck is bean dadding?
[0:34:38] <Fien111> If anyone saw this stream and still thought "I don't know, this game looks interesting..." I still want to tell you not to try it. if you still for some reason do.....welcome to the vibes
[0:34:39] <+Double_negative> Kenshi is great, but i think Pat was way over thinking things and was focusing on the worst advice. "Just read a guide" ffs
[0:34:42] <@SoFarFetched> @bapposbungers he definitely enjoyed the voice acting!
[0:34:43] <KaiserMario> @TungstenViper Not really dude... It's unusual at least
[0:34:45] <+OwlLightningMage> This shit fest is actually what I hoping for
[0:34:46] <%blastyoboots> @Badgerconda_ You mean an imagination AND the patience to invest hours into understanding an unintuitive and underdesigned control scheme and way of interacting with the world.
[0:34:49] <cherrycottontail> @TungstenViper you don't need to do that though. It's just clear that Pat is not interested in exploring those things himself, so you gotta point him to easier ways of learning
[0:34:50] <+glgzephyr> @Kitrane Google bean dad and you will know
[0:34:51] <DianaTheAscian> @DudeDern I don't think so
[0:34:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @blackbaron98 Which granted was only four hours, but it's so fuckin' obtuse that I can't get into it
[0:34:57] <+TungstenViper> @blackbaron98 i don't understand this question?
[0:34:59] <RWLJr98> I mainly play ARK and proudly say my game is trash
[0:35:02] <jorniev> @bapposbungers HE liked the acting so far
[0:35:04] <SovPho> @Double_negative lp funsies
[0:35:04] <Ekaelis> @yourliteraldog i disagree with that, he is but not when reviewing games
[0:35:07] <penitentpendant> @Kitrane Setting someone up in a situation where they don't know anything then taunting/making fun of them when they flounder about not knowing what to do.
[0:35:12] <Badgerconda_> @blastyoboots I don't think it's particularly unintuitive, but I'm not a teenager so I grew up playing games that were waaaay less intuitive than this.
[0:35:13] <+hrudzie_1> this flame war is going to rage all the way until the next podcast
[0:35:19] <%blastyoboots> Chat was DEFINITELY bean dad and I feel bad for helping
[0:35:20] <RyuuAoi> Pat should play Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball. He promised us titties last night! I want my titties, @patstaresat
[0:35:23] <T_Sasquatch> mallet boy please speak up
[0:35:32] <T_Sasquatch> where are you mallet boyyy
[0:35:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm just here for the dumpster fire
[0:35:37] <@SoFarFetched> hes gone
[0:35:39] <KaiserMario> What's "bean dad"?

[0:35:44] <+TungstenViper> @cherrycottontail ??? i mean, the game doesn't introduce you to mechanics or objectives. how is he the issue here?

[0:35:48] <jorniev> cant people just like the game chat?, i saw a bunch of people that just agreed with pat and still liked the game
[0:35:50] <%BinaryFireball> Listen people who think kenshi is trash. You have to understand that there are games that are jank and complex as fuck, and wont hold your hand. Most people dont like these games because they are totally unapproachable unless you 1. know there is a pot of gold at the end of the shitbow 2. know what to expect  when you start out because you have played other jank hotness

[0:41:45] <Hs413> CRUELTY SQUAD

[0:41:54] <%BoxNavy> it really is just an idle game
[0:41:55] <+Double_Tap_That> It's a clicker game
[0:41:55] <Badgerconda_> Kinda agree with pat on this one.
[0:41:55] <$dalmek> it IS just a sorta fancy clicker game
[0:41:55] <lambishly> Cruelty Squad lets go 3 for 3

[0:42:41] <@PeachSaliva> what is pat doing
[0:42:43] <+TungstenViper> Because we're devolving into souless machines, that's why
[0:42:43] <2DSuperiority> Fall Guys so you can get the Kizuna Ai costume zoneDosh
[0:42:44] <+Soliloquy123> To optimize the numbers so that the autoplaying game actually wins
[0:42:44] <Siconia> RE2 run lets go

[0:42:45] <%BoxNavy> SourPls

[0:43:19] <%sleeplessmetro> Hi Paige, Pat super hates Kenshi and now he's trying to think of new game to play
[0:43:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Oh, I feel like if Pat was made to play more than 10 hours of Noita, he'd be hooked.
[0:43:21] <Meltgar> @PeachSaliva Fighting Gief for the last slice of cheese
[0:43:21] <@SoFarFetched> nah its all good
[0:43:25] <%BoxNavy> its ok
[0:43:26] <+OwlLightningMage> For the people that showed up late, Pat fucking hated Kenshi LUL
[0:43:26] <@PeachSaliva> I'm working up here and Gief is mad I wont pet him lol

[0:43:45] <%the22cstomp> what did he hate about it?
[0:43:46] <Zebroneath> boy*
[0:43:47] <+TungstenViper> Doggo is mad
[0:43:49] <%dekkitout> Can't the lad pet himself SeriousSloth
[0:43:51] <DudeDern> Why do people keep recommending rouge-likes? Pat usually doesn’t like them
[0:43:52] <bob900000> what is happening?
[0:43:52] <%crimsonharvest> If you've already played some colony sims like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld, Kenshi feels a lot more normal
[0:43:54] <%bassoontyphoon> Play random fucking Sporcle quizzes
[0:43:55] <%JoshManVGH> Man he is going to be able to take that door off the hinges in a few months.
[0:43:56] <RyuuAoi> Put the coke away, Peach!
[0:43:57] <+g4mejoy> I second the Gamer Quiz suggestion, seems interesting
[0:43:58] <RetributionP> poor geif
[0:43:59] <%Shackle_Rustyford> what did i miss
[0:44:00] <tolloponik> chat what happen did pat break Kenshin?
[0:44:02] <%walternatorz> how can anyone deprive Zangief of pets?
[0:44:03] <Siconia> Gief hates Kenshi
[0:44:04] <+MayorRev> pat should have a dedicated doggo day
[0:44:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat hated literally everything about Kenshi
[0:44:05] <%sleeplessmetro> Doggo is cute-o its opkay
[0:44:10] <RetributionP> being ignored by his mama
[0:44:10] <@SoFarFetched> @DudeDern hey some people really like the sonic series...ESPECIALLY Rouge Kappa
[0:44:13] <%bassoontyphoon> @tolloponik it broke him
[0:44:14] <Siconia> Kenshi broke Pat
[0:44:16] <+glgzephyr> @PeachSaliva Don't sweat it, the whole stream has been a lesson in patience
[0:44:17] <+Pilzkun> "Thank you for your patience" I mean it's this or reading about estoppel
[0:44:18] <samazam94> please hug and kiss pat for us paige. he needs it @peachsaliva
[0:44:19] <RWLJr98> Kenshi broke pat
[0:44:19] <+fetrigon> @PeachSaliva S'all gud
[0:44:21] <Badgerconda_> Kenshi broke Pat by not being a dumb babby game @tolloponik
[0:44:21] <%Nekros4442> @PeachSaliva Paige we're trained to sit through over an hour of rambling (though entertaining) at the start of most streams
[0:44:22] <aiutare47> @the22cstomp The openendedness threw him along with the SUPER unintuitive everything
[0:44:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> By this point he may just call it given that his brain just fried from all that
[0:44:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> play balan wonderland
[0:44:26] <Siconia> Man Pat and Woolie both having rough streams today
[0:44:27] <+Pilzkun> or privity of contracts, again
[0:44:27] <+Despera__> @tolloponik kenshi broke him
[0:44:29] <jbrachob> Kenshi broke pat
[0:44:32] <iq_dropper> @tolloponik Kenshin beat Pat
[0:44:32] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat hated literally everything about Kenshi and he didn't get it at all LUL
[0:44:34] <%justcallmebobplease> T-Pose aggressively at Pat some time.  You don't need to record it or nothin', I just want to know that at some point, you went ham posin', and he had no idea why.
[0:44:34] <$RealThiele> Kenshi died on its way back to its home plant.
[0:44:35] <%JoshManVGH> Time Until Geif makes his own doggie door? What are peoples bets?
[0:44:38] <%Shackle_Rustyford> wait kenshi did it but fucking factorio didnt
[0:44:38] <jorniev> PLAY SYNTHETIK
[0:44:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat should play that Balan Wonderworld game.
[0:44:44] <+DmanDoesThings> @the22cstomp pat mostly disliked the lack of direction and being really lost on what to do, as well as other stuff being unintuitive or frustrating.
[0:44:46] <follyofjolly> @the22cstomp Eh. It's not super intuitive, and chat was being not great.
[0:44:47] <CollinsOfBodom> Pat beat Kenshi in record time
[0:44:55] <yourliteraldog> Kenshi didn't brake pat. We broke pat
[0:44:57] <+alpharius88> @tolloponik Kenshi won (pat was having trouble to "Get the game")
[0:45:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> balan wonderland is a fever dream
[0:45:06] <penitentpendant> @PeachSaliva Tonight, I feel Chat owes Pat more an apology than vice versa
[0:45:08] <@SoFarFetched> @Shackle_Rustyford probably because at least factorio's tutorial was abit more friendly and readable than Kenshi's
[0:45:09] <Vermillion129> Just got here, is pat gonna change games?
[0:45:11] <+Pilzkun> personally the lack of direction can be difficult
[0:45:12] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva Come play Left 4 Dead with Pat please
[0:45:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Kenshi had zero chance of winning over Pat
[0:45:14] <%darklordfodder> do mount and blade.  it's kind of similar but way less complicated
[0:45:15] <%backfire_shot> @the22cstomp Chat was actively being beyond not helpful
[0:45:15] <%Shackle_Rustyford> """""we"""""
[0:45:16] <Broken_Sonex> @tolloponik CHAT BECOME BEAN DAD
[0:45:21] <+Pilzkun> like a lot of sandboxes at least give you SOMETHING to work towards
[0:45:27] <+Pilzkun> kenshi is just kinda like "Hey, go"
[0:45:30] <+Pilzkun> "Go do"
[0:45:37] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt What about playing some INTO THE BREACH or such?  I recently learned there's mods that add NEW SQUADS for you to try?  like a water squad that creates water tiles for you to push kaiju into
[0:45:38] <Hs413> cruelty squad, let's take a trip.
[0:45:38] <%BoxNavy> hi

[0:47:02] <Broken_Sonex> @Badgerconda_ Bye jack ass
[0:47:03] <%Reaped_Psyche> I can always take solace that I will never be as old as Pat.
[0:47:03] <Orenjevel> I adore roguelikes generally, dunno why I bounced off Gungeon. Maybe I should give it another chance.
[0:47:03] <ullyzeez> boomer
[0:47:04] <%MechArch> NotLikeThis
[0:47:04] <%Shackle_Rustyford> pat makes me feel young and i HATE THIS NOW FUCK
[0:47:04] <%Archphronimos> Pat I'm so sorry that Kenshi has stressed you this much, thank you for trying it
[0:47:06] <+Terikatown> @patstaresat you have rabid fans and always have great content. take some deep breaths, gaming is supposed to be fun.
[0:47:09] <xeros720> i thought pat was only one year older than me, but that means i'm 34, fuck

[0:48:10] <lemon_lover28> I love this game but am so bad

[0:48:12] <+aogman> ENTER THE GUN
[0:48:13] <RyuuAoi> Pat does share a bday with Hitler!
[0:48:13] <+Pilzkun> yeah that sounds about right
[0:48:14] <mattynezz> Oh wow, Pat, already gave up on Kenshi
[0:48:15] <+g4mejoy> Rip Kenshi, poison for stream and TV
[0:48:17] <+TungstenViper> LUL
[0:48:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Kenshi Demon game confirmed
[0:48:19] <Wreckinize> done with monster hunter?
[0:48:20] <balthazar758> hahaha oh man
[0:48:21] <T_Sasquatch> Complaining about chat is funny because you're basically shouting at a crowd
[0:48:21] <jorniev> totally kenshi
[0:48:21] <+Pilzkun> Kenshi is not stable
[0:48:22] <Broken_Sonex> IT WAS ALL KEINSHI'S FAULT
[0:48:23] <Saltmeisterr> gongoen tim
[0:48:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Rainbow runs are broken
[0:48:25] <penitentpendant> Love that store discount as Pilot
[0:48:25] <%wibbwobbler> yeesh
[0:48:26] <+funya_rinpa> but pupper
[0:48:26] <$lotharrio> Bouncing off Kenshi so hard that it breaks your computer.
[0:48:27] <%BoxNavy> ohhh....
[0:48:27] <CursedNobleman> DansGame pilot.
[0:48:28] <%spitelite> i feel like the game actively didn't want you specifically to play it
[0:48:29] <Siconia> YEAH back to basics
[0:48:30] <benjiFG> unlock gunslinger coward
[0:48:31] <12gagerager> Cheer1000 Would you ever do a STALKER Stream?
[0:48:31] <jorniev> STILL FUN
[0:48:31] <Meltgar> PAT

[0:48:36] <+NecDW4> LUL
[0:48:36] <%the22cstomp> sorry the game was ass pat, hope you enjoy gungeon more
[0:48:36] <bob900000> @follyofjolly what happened?
[0:48:38] <%thelaxinator> Indie game does not like 144fps...
[0:48:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Rainbow chest runs are fucking broken
[0:48:39] <Orenjevel> RIP
[0:48:42] <+PenmanLupine> thats what you get for not know you have to play Kenshi on DosBox for the optimal playthrough after reading through several novels worth of guides
[0:48:42] <%TheLakinessMonster> Kenshi is just the power of woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:48:42] <%Shackle_Rustyford> tfw pilot irl
[0:48:44] <+TungstenViper> GREAT START
[0:48:44] <+LeoKira997> this isnt kenshi wtf twitch lied to me

[0:48:48] <+remdiel> Loop hero?
[0:48:48] <ullyzeez> wtf no gunslinger???
[0:48:49] <Siconia> Wait for the new stalker
[0:48:50] <+FingaLights> :) There is a Kenshi 2 in the works
[0:48:50] <%Shackle_Rustyford> its not nearly this cool
[0:48:50] <%BoxNavy> stalker 2 is coming out so
[0:48:52] <mattynezz> The oldest one is the only good one
[0:48:54] <Meltgar> SHOVELGUN Kappa
[0:48:56] <+glgzephyr> I mean, it's a hard game to finish
[0:48:56] <balthazar758> yo stalker
[0:48:56] <+g4mejoy> Neither have I, don't worry.
[0:48:57] <%redthebaron> i love this game so much
[0:49:00] <Madovir> YOU NEED TO PUT ON THE COSTUME TO UNLOCK THE WEAPON
[0:49:01] <%Monkeyweed21> WAIT WHAT
[0:49:01] <Mr_Rakjo> Gunslinger Best Class
[0:49:01] <+SoySocks> how do you get the alternate gun, again?
[0:49:05] <+g4mejoy> Didn't even know they had alt start guns
[0:49:06] <$lotharrio> @remdiel He's not a fan of Loop Hero.
[0:49:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Just do a rainbow chest run
[0:49:08] <+NecDW4> A fucking Shovle Knight Gun?
[0:49:08] <The_SPHD> Pat are you planning on cutting out the Kenshin content from your VOD?
[0:49:08] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:49:08] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:49:09] <+NecDW4> lol
[0:49:13] <Siconia> What a start LUL
[0:49:13] <casualcthulhu11> nice
[0:49:15] <RyuuAoi> Did MONKEYWEED suggest Kenshi?
[0:49:15] <+Soliloquy123> The STALKER Anomaly standalone mod is wonderful but similarly "make your own goal"
[0:49:16] <Broken_Sonex> @BoxNavy Is that legit?
[0:49:27] <lemon_lover28> I have never cleared a run
[0:49:34] <%Garthunox> cheer500 have some bits to destress, thanks for the stream while i continue my descent into triple triad hell, got some of the rare ones from npcs like Hien and Hildy, but hoo boy it's rough, cant wait to farm the ones from raids and shit
[0:49:34] <+remdiel> @lotharrio Oh, cool, tnx for the heads up.
[0:49:35] <+g4mejoy> Real shit? No wonder I never heard of it, I never used the alt costumes.
[0:49:36] <%redthebaron> pilot past is the big ship right
[0:49:37] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt how do you get the alternate costume?
[0:49:40] <%CalderGaming> oh thank goodness, gameplay to come back to
[0:49:40] <%BoxNavy> @Broken_Sonex yea
[0:49:41] <BlackIronClam> Gungeon is just a good time
[0:49:43] <ergulor> why don't you try unlocking the gunslinger then?
[0:49:46] <T_Sasquatch> i have never beaten this game
[0:49:48] <%the22cstomp> it's fun to schut
[0:49:51] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is way too samey to me
[0:49:52] <+glgzephyr> it feel good to play
[0:49:55] <%TheLakinessMonster> The puns are powerful as well.
[0:49:56] <Louie_Salmon> That
[0:49:57] <%BoxNavy> im too trash at gungeon to enjoy it
[0:49:57] <shubachi> feels good to play, not like kenshi
[0:49:57] <ullyzeez> rainbow runs are so much more fun
[0:49:57] <Saltmeisterr> @s1rcuit beat the past once
[0:50:01] <Broken_Sonex> @BoxNavy What else do you knwo?
[0:50:03] <%SirGO0SE> Restart Randy LUL
[0:50:03] <T_Sasquatch> i barely got past level 4 or 5 LUL
[0:50:04] <+TungstenViper> Does this game have objectives? Kappa
[0:50:05] <+RushUnplugged> did you unlock the option to do Rainbow runs?
[0:50:11] <RetributionP> oh god
[0:50:15] <swift_malachi> Hades is way way better, but I wholeheartedly agree, this is easily one of the best roguelikes
[0:50:16] <ullyzeez> scrub
[0:50:17] <+D00msDayDan> i wonder who that could be
[0:50:18] <RWLJr98> He's your foil
[0:50:19] <+Jiggisnipe> who could that be? Kappa
[0:50:19] <Siconia> Game kinda loud?
[0:50:21] <Louie_Salmon> Mm yeah
[0:50:22] <follyofjolly> @bob900000 Kenshi's a weird jank game thats jank, and between confusion, ruder hyper-fanboys and people bandwagoning on a hate train- everything went downhill VERY fast
[0:50:25] <%bassoontyphoon> Paige?
[0:50:26] <s1rcuit> @Saltmeisterr cool, thanks
[0:50:27] <sir_foxwood> It's free on psn right now. No excuse not to play it
[0:50:29] <Zeif00> woolieSHOOK
[0:50:29] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:50:30] <CursedNobleman> the vergil to your dante.
[0:50:31] <+OwlLightningMage> IT BEGINS
[0:50:34] <Siconia> Thanks chief
[0:50:34] <%SaiyanShoto> sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[0:50:35] <LunarRemix> Shots fired
[0:50:36] <%cache_22> sbfpScared
[0:50:36] <iosephe> Elmo, got it
[0:50:38] <%justcallmebobplease> I WONDER IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT INDIVISIBLE
[0:50:38] <%MechArch> shoot da gun
[0:50:40] <%Roasted_Pheasant> No Pat you're quiet
[0:50:42] <whymymore> woolieMIRIN
[0:50:42] <+glgzephyr> oh no, the over adjustment. Ah well
[0:50:42] <rosemon5001> ahhh that reminds me the new isaac dlc is out
[0:50:42] <DianaTheAscian> yeah only idiots think that
[0:50:43] <%Keaton_x> Gonna call it a night. Was supposed to have my first date in years on Sunday, but she's been radio silent since learning I'm significantly older than she initially thought. Gonna go cry myself to sleep. Hope you all have a fantastic night.
[0:50:43] <Orenjevel> Is there a reason he's restarting when he takes damage?
[0:50:44] <ullyzeez> who would that be???
[0:50:45] <SomeOtherNeb> it's way too quiet now
[0:50:45] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT WAS 18 MONTHS AGO
[0:50:48] <julrave> Boolie talking about Blindivisble
[0:50:50] <+Pleasant21> too loud to no sound
[0:50:51] <Saltmeisterr> @s1rcuit which each character of course
[0:50:51] <Broken_Sonex> @bob900000 AND....Bean Dad chat
[0:50:53] <aiutare47> DO NOT BE
[0:50:53] <+glgzephyr> seriously do not sweat it
[0:50:53] <Siconia> Understand
[0:50:55] <T_Sasquatch> dont be
[0:50:56] <%cache_22> I just got here. What did Kenchi do?
[0:50:57] <%SirGO0SE> play it again in your free time with no pressure
[0:50:58] <mattynezz> Did Pat even manage to boot Kenshi?
[0:50:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat really doesn't like God Hand huh
[0:51:03] <%Broand> Oh starsector!
[0:51:04] <+TungstenViper> Understand
[0:51:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I dunno, Pat, Seth likes WEIRD shit
[0:51:06] <cheapdoc> You wanted to GET kenshi
[0:51:07] <xeros720> you can appreciate it from a distance
[0:51:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat just give up
[0:51:08] <RWLJr98> You dont get overwhelmingly positive reviews for no reason
[0:51:08] <+Pilzkun> Kenshi's kinda like Dwarf Fortress but not as Dorfy
[0:51:09] <benjiFG> pat why
[0:51:09] <RetributionP> music up by 5%
[0:51:10] <follyofjolly> You don't have to man!
[0:51:11] <Louie_Salmon> You want to be able to at least fully hate Kenshi
[0:51:12] <+Jiggisnipe> seems like you have to invest time to enjoy it
[0:51:13] <+glgzephyr> sometimes a thing is not worth appreciating
[0:51:15] <%Dunmarkh> @cache_22 he walked to a different town then died
[0:51:16] <@commanderclaw> If you don't appreciate making your own goals, you probably won't appreciate Kenshi
[0:51:17] <%BoxNavy> not being able to appreciate a game sucks jermaPluto
[0:51:18] <s1rcuit> @Saltmeisterr of course
[0:51:22] <+g4mejoy> Kenshi is one of those **niche** games.
[0:51:22] <+Pilzkun> there's a lot going on there but holy hell is it kinda miserable to play
[0:51:24] <%justcallmebobplease> Oh fuck, I feel like Pat'd like Star Sector.
[0:51:24] <Visorak6> Did you change the game?
[0:51:24] <%abusywizard> gamefeel is super underrated, it's the main reason i cant really enjoy DS2
[0:51:26] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt I love that game but man dont beat yourself up over it. its a weird ass game.
[0:51:27] <SomeOtherNeb> I tried Kenshi a couple months back and it was so janky I asked for a refund after an hour
[0:51:29] <ullyzeez> just enjoy the sseth video dude
[0:51:30] <RWLJr98> But then again, anime dating sims get overwhelming on steam
[0:51:41] <benjiFG> very true words
[0:51:44] <+OwlLightningMage> I love it so much
[0:51:46] <%Reaped_Psyche> Kenshi is best appreciated by watching the people who already know what can be done in it.  You just may not want to play it.
[0:51:47] <%AncelDeLambert> I think it's safe and fair to write stuff off as "Seth bait"
[0:51:49] <$Afterman_> pat did nothing wrong
[0:51:51] <+seoliart> we're just masochists LUL
[0:51:52] <%Nekros4442> @RWLJr98 but it's not a mystery why anime dating sims are rated well
[0:51:53] <$Afterman_> nothing wrong this time
[0:51:53] <+ItalianWaifu> i think of it like a base builder
[0:51:58] <Madovir> sometimes there isn't
[0:52:01] <+glgzephyr> he's just gonna reset every time he gets hit LUL
[0:52:01] <%rios> there is @patstaresat
[0:52:03] <Broken_Sonex> The "Somthing." is a jank sandbox.
[0:52:06] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt Honestly despite them saying Wander is the intended start, it's garbage for putting you NEAR the interesting stuff. Several other starts place you right next to major factions that actually explain how they work
[0:52:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt people still play PUBG
[0:52:10] <mattynezz> You might be better off with a more accessible Kenshi, like Mount and Blade or Starsector
[0:52:12] <+TungstenViper> what if that "something" is simply people having Bad taste?
[0:52:12] <%Garthunox> you cant polish a turd
[0:52:14] <jorniev> some times its not for you
[0:52:16] <%BoxNavy> only schut. only fite
[0:52:21] <Manwad> you have one verb and it's schut
[0:52:23] <thepardack> Sseth likes whack bullshit
[0:52:30] <Visorak6> Sunk cost fallacy probably
[0:52:31] <+glgzephyr> it has a unique jank feel to it
[0:52:31] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt You know how some people didn't like early Monster Hunter because of the grindy unintuitiveness?  Kenshi has that hours-long gate of grindy unintuitiveness WITHOUT a tutorial or clear goals.  That's what it is
[0:52:31] <jorniev> @mattynezz ooof probably not
[0:52:33] <RWLJr98> I still play PUBG :(
[0:52:36] <penitentpendant> Sunk Cost Fallacy?
[0:52:38] <+SoySocks> it's no mystery why fortnite stole pubg's lunch
[0:52:38] <%MonsterEnvy> Or Apex
[0:52:41] <Madovir> sunk cost/stockholm syndrome
[0:52:44] <aiutare47> The rumor is that most of PUBGs player count is bots
[0:52:46] <%cache_22> PUBG has that mobile money because of Fortnite shot themselves in the foot with Apple and Google.
[0:52:48] <follyofjolly> @Garthunox :) wow dude
[0:52:49] <%bassoontyphoon> The only way I can understand people playing PUBG is the sunk cost fallacy
[0:52:51] <%BoxNavy> wwarzone is 50000TB though
[0:52:54] <RWLJr98> PUBG has a great esports following
[0:52:54] <+glgzephyr> nah fortnite forces you into third person. Warzone is the REAL PUBG replacement
[0:52:57] <%SaiyanShoto> But they dont want to play those, they want to play PUBG
[0:53:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> People like PUBG for the weapon simulation. Warzone is'nt like tat
[0:53:03] <+PenmanLupine> If you want to continue to deny the world the existence of Titanfall 3, play Apex.
[0:53:04] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[0:53:05] <+MayorRev> wait does pat still do the restart after one hit in gungeon lmao
[0:53:05] <dragoon001914> But Fortnite is kind of ugly and Warzone is too fucking big
[0:53:07] <The_SPHD> maybe it's just the idea of RP in a story free sandbox, like GTA Nopixel?
[0:53:08] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat I appreciate your quick look at Kenshi! It brought us back to the good old days. bleedPurple
[0:53:09] <Hydrapissed> jesus
[0:53:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Warzone certainly isn't the PUBG replacement
[0:53:12] <+Pleasant21> Warzone taught me that memory is just a number
[0:53:14] <s1rcuit> Warzone is terribly clunky to me, especially after playing Fortnite and Apex
[0:53:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> PUBG is much slower paced
[0:53:17] <jorniev> People like things that you don't like that's the way the world works
[0:53:18] <%ssjklyco> They finally  decreased it by 10 whole GB
[0:53:23] <%Monkeyweed21> people play STAR CITIZEN FFS @PatStaresAt
[0:53:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Warzone is fucking shit
[0:53:27] <T_Sasquatch> i uninstalled warzone when i realized i could install 10 games instead of playing it
[0:53:28] <+glgzephyr> @KeiganOfAstora Then what is? genuine question
[0:53:30] <+funya_rinpa> Warzone is my favorite BR but I also like other games so I can never play it
[0:53:30] <balthazar758> shitzillion units
[0:53:33] <%spitelite> maybe its sunk cost fallacy
[0:53:33] <%W1nterTitan> You don't
[0:53:35] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh do it
[0:53:36] <%BoxNavy> oh cmon you dont
[0:53:36] <RWLJr98> don't worry about it
[0:53:37] <Hydrapissed> 24 hrs
[0:53:37] <+MayorRev> I thought he'd be over that but anyway
[0:53:38] <aiutare47> Also untrue
[0:53:38] <+g4mejoy> Nah man don't worry about it
[0:53:38] <Brandon__Brando> I just started playing fortnite again this AI matches are a waste of my time
[0:53:39] <T_Sasquatch> you DO NOT
[0:53:40] <@SoFarFetched> nah don't worry about that pat. We understand if you have bad stream days./
[0:53:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nothing, PUBG is it's own beast
[0:53:40] <%BinaryFireball> dude I just want you to be happy
[0:53:41] <TOMO_VENDOR> @PatStaresAt 24 hours stream sadgeiHmm
[0:53:41] <+glgzephyr> so is PUBG, last I checked
[0:53:43] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't worry
[0:53:43] <CollinsOfBodom> naw man
[0:53:44] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck that
[0:53:44] <%Dunmarkh> because you got nae naed
[0:53:45] <+SleazyShell> warzone doesn't have solos anymore right
[0:53:45] <Sacrifall> Paige Asleep already?
[0:53:46] <scrumbotime> At some point COD is just going to be a thumbdrive you put in your computer and it deletes and replaces your whole OS with COD
[0:53:46] <%bassoontyphoon> no you dont
[0:53:47] <%SaiyanShoto> you don't have to
[0:53:48] <%backfire_shot> backfire_shot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Feel free to not read out loud as it may reignite Kenshi arguing I understand why you don't like Kenshi but I do think you'd love the World and its Characters its filled to the brim with living legends, amazing scenery and environment story telling.
[0:53:50] <$Afterman_> what no
[0:53:50] <shubachi> don't do that, just end when you want to
[0:53:51] <+ScottishMadJacko> you don't owe us shit man
[0:53:52] <+MayorRev> ahahahaha
[0:53:53] <samazam94> that was 2 hours?
[0:53:53] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt that's not your fault or true
[0:53:53] <%JoshManVGH> You don't owe anybody jackshit
[0:53:54] <MoonKing> PUBG in first person is just a multiplayer horror game more than a BR
[0:53:54] <$Afterman_> if anything its opposite
[0:53:55] <Meekest> End the stream EARLY show us who's boss
[0:53:56] <+Jiggisnipe> yep now you gotta stream to 5 am Kappa
[0:53:59] <RWLJr98> I will accept nothing less than36 hour stream, make it snappy
[0:54:00] <ullyzeez> does pat not know the secret room???
[0:54:01] <maskedmook> if you're not up for it don't
[0:54:01] <+archangel9889> nah man. you good.
[0:54:01] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva What're you doing tonight?
[0:54:02] <%ospreyworks> aw pat, don't feel obligated
[0:54:08] <$Afterman_> no kensei just sucked dick
[0:54:15] <benjiFG> the wiki sayd 50% but man it really doesn't feel like it
[0:54:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Warzone is just Squad Deathmatch with a really large map. Prove me wrong
[0:54:18] <Holofono> its fine, the jank is still entertaining
[0:54:18] <%sleeplessmetro> You really don't dude, take care of yourself <8(
[0:54:22] <ullyzeez> now i wanna play gunegon dammit
[0:54:23] <T_Sasquatch> i would rather you end the stream than force yourself to play a videogame LUL
[0:54:28] <scrumbotime> Ser Junken
[0:54:29] <thepardack> I only use the lockpicks on the alternate path locks and if I'm stupid desperate.
[0:54:36] <ullyzeez> POG
[0:54:37] <jorniev> just scream at us how stupid we are and end the stream early like a chad
[0:54:39] <RyuuAoi> You didn't blow it, Pat! Remember the Zaibatsu. This is what we came for!
[0:54:40] <%YPFrost> nothing does suck
[0:54:43] <%redthebaron> sir junkan
[0:54:44] <%0rond> ser junken is crazy, it's run winning
[0:54:46] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you forget people come to the stream for you, not the game, the game is just extra
[0:54:48] <benjiFG> no
[0:54:49] <%MonsterEnvy> Thinking of checking out Evil Genius 2
[0:54:58] <penitentpendant> Now that I think of it, Both Pat and Woolie had goofy runs of games today
[0:55:04] <RWLJr98> no :)
[0:55:05] <%g4mejoy> g4mejoy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Don't sweat Kenshi dude, we come to the stream for you, and Gief, and Emlo, and Paige when she isn't streaming herself.
[0:55:05] <heythatguy> Ah damn
[0:55:13] <%Broand> Evil genius 2 has denuvo
[0:55:16] <RyuuAoi> I'm here for the Orb and only the Orb.
[0:55:17] <T_Sasquatch> yes
[0:55:17] <thepardack> @penitentpendant what did woolie play?
[0:55:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Ye?
[0:55:19] <+ScottishMadJacko> like it's nice to see you enjoy a game I like but I'd rather just you play what you like and have fun
[0:55:22] <%the22cstomp> yes
[0:55:24] <%BoxNavy> yea
[0:55:27] <aiutare47> Depends
[0:55:27] <T_Sasquatch> no
[0:55:28] <%BinaryFireball> half and half
[0:55:28] <%YPFrost> yes?
[0:55:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes
[0:55:28] <%Shackle_Rustyford> depends on the streamer
[0:55:29] <+MayorRev> has pat always done the manual restart after 1 hit thing?
[0:55:31] <%ospreyworks> moreover now
[0:55:32] <%bassoontyphoon> yea
[0:55:32] <%GarbageNirvana> I think it depends
[0:55:32] <ManaSpurt> They cry
[0:55:33] <%MonsterEnvy> @Broand Why does that matter?
[0:55:33] <T_Sasquatch> yes and no
[0:55:33] <%Arancet> most id watch are blunt
[0:55:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes and no
[0:55:34] <%W1nterTitan> I know like DesertP will be open
[0:55:35] <lemon_lover28> depends on the person
[0:55:36] <HeroToxiko> yes
[0:55:36] <%Dunmarkh> dude I basically just watch you idk
[0:55:37] <SomeOtherNeb> yes but I just watch you and NL
[0:55:37] <RWLJr98> Depends on the community. smaller ones are more open
[0:55:38] <LunarRemix> Depends on the streamer
[0:55:39] <%cache_22> The streamers I follow are pretty blunt with how things are going.
[0:55:39] <%BoxNavy> streamers tend to be open about that type of shit
[0:55:39] <%W1nterTitan> So like Halfish
[0:55:39] <$lotharrio> 50-50
[0:55:40] <bob900000> depends
[0:55:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> Dont really watch other streamers, i guess this is normal to me XD
[0:55:41] <%MidnightBurst12> it really depends
[0:55:41] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i do, i believe it depend son how "themselves" they are
[0:55:41] <Teyaric> Human sincerity is highly valuable.
[0:55:41] <yourliteraldog> Depends
[0:55:41] <%0rond> the ones I watch are pretty realistic/self deprecationg
[0:55:42] <+ScottishMadJacko> I feel you're more blunt than some but it's good
[0:55:42] <%ssjklyco> Completionst talks about it alot on his LPs
[0:55:42] <%redthebaron> only real big streamers are like that
[0:55:43] <xcompleasedad> The good streamers call it out
[0:55:43] <+funya_rinpa> It varies, I guess
[0:55:44] <%BinaryFireball> depends if they are "performing"
[0:55:44] <%Reaped_Psyche> People are a lot more open these days.
[0:55:44] <peyodogo> depends on the stream, the ones i like are always frank about it
[0:55:44] <+glgzephyr> it absolutely depends on the person, to the surprise of no one
[0:55:44] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt idk i don't watch many people
[0:55:45] <+remdiel> On MY bubble, its pretty normal.
[0:55:45] <%Shackle_Rustyford> people like asmon make their entire career on honesty like that
[0:55:46] <%ospreyworks> moreso now than ever
[0:55:46] <%Garthunox> Oh pat, you should stream final fantasy 14, the free trial now goes up to level 60! AND it includes the acclaimed Heavensward expansion!
[0:55:47] <Louie_Salmon> Uh the ones I watch yes, the popular ones definitely the crying
[0:55:47] <%thbluewarden> probably both at some point
[0:55:47] <%sleeplessmetro> I watch super blunt people
[0:55:48] <%YakumoYomi> Don't know about Twitch, but it seems pretty common with vTubers
[0:55:49] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt I mean...Hololive English has this curse where pretty much every stream they've done has run into technical problems. It's kind of a meme in the communityn ow
[0:55:49] <iosephe> It really depends, but also i don't think I'd watch the latter
[0:55:49] <lemon_lover28> I certainly prefer the blunt ones
[0:55:51] <balthazar758> depends I think
[0:55:51] <%solracc25> yes it's common
[0:55:51] <%TheLakinessMonster> It could be their equivalent to a 9-5 so probably.
[0:55:51] <peyodogo> inside baseball, as northernlion calls it
[0:55:53] <CursedNobleman> i watch people that dont have that silly curtain
[0:55:54] <+FingaLights> na, most i watch are like that
[0:55:54] <%genocidal_cupcake> No, and its refreshing
[0:55:55] <mattynezz> It's you, Woolie, and Vinnie. Everyone else appears to be a pod person based on my limited experience
[0:55:55] <%slimmixrp> 60-40
[0:55:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> It used to be way more "Cry off camera"
[0:55:55] <swift_malachi> most streamers that I watch talk about it like you, but that might be selective bias
[0:55:58] <KaiserMario> Aris constantly shits on chat and call it dumb for liking bad games
[0:55:58] <%BubbaRands> depends on the streamer and audience really...
[0:55:58] <yourliteraldog> I prefer your temperment
[0:56:00] <%JoshManVGH> Depends. Like if they are on a podcast and it comes up they will talk about it.
[0:56:00] <%bassoontyphoon> The ones who have been doing this for a while are more like you. the newer ones are the more enthusiastic on camera
[0:56:01] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> appreciate the honesty tbh
[0:56:02] <Brandon__Brando> I like blunt
[0:56:04] <HeroToxiko> i know this one dude who is a whole himbo and i appreciate him for that but shgit burns tbh
[0:56:05] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah some streamers know when they're having a bad stream.
[0:56:05] <aiutare47> it depends on the "brand image" and the persons personality
[0:56:05] <+RyTYoung> Some streamers are just very one note and are either talking to their friends constantly, and only coming up for air to say thanks for dono's
[0:56:06] <RetributionP> no pat you are not neat and different
[0:56:07] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it's common behavior on your part, the one's who care about doing a good job feel bad if they think they botched a stream
[0:56:07] <$12gagerager> Most of the people i watch are smaller streamers, theyre usually pretty open about being burnt out on a stream.
[0:56:08] <%solracc25> Some you can see fake it
[0:56:09] <RWLJr98> he did?
[0:56:10] <%BoxNavy> he did? monkaS
[0:56:10] <Louie_Salmon> He did?
[0:56:11] <+glgzephyr> Woolie played that!?
[0:56:11] <lambishly> HE DID
[0:56:13] <lambishly> ??
[0:56:13] <T_Sasquatch> imagine being ninja and HAVING to playfortnite , he was losing his fucking mind but he had millions
[0:56:14] <LunarRemix> Woolie played Kenshin?
[0:56:14] <%sleeplessmetro> The only streamers I really watch on here are you, Max, woolie, and Vinny
[0:56:14] <+Jiggisnipe> he did?
[0:56:14] <The_SPHD> I can only speak for myself, but most of the twitch folks I follow, like yourself, seem blunt and almost transparent
[0:56:14] <%redthebaron> woolie played kenshi?
[0:56:15] <%GarbageNirvana> When did Woolie play Kenshi?
[0:56:15] <%cephalon_nyt> most of the peeps I watch are blunt about it
[0:56:15] <julrave> I don't know if there's a lot of crossover between your audience and the people who watch streamers who have like 10k viewers consistently
[0:56:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's Woolie
[0:56:17] <%redthebaron> what
[0:56:17] <+seoliart> He did?
[0:56:18] <+ScottishMadJacko> he did?
[0:56:19] <xcompleasedad> WOOLIE played Kenshi????
[0:56:19] <jorniev> I ENJOY you BRUTAL honesty
[0:56:20] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie played Kenshi? LUL
[0:56:20] <huskarl_zap> cause its called kenshi
[0:56:21] <%JoshManVGH> Some honest about it from the start, but others maintain brand.
[0:56:21] <bob900000> did he?
[0:56:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie does things no one understands
[0:56:22] <%bassoontyphoon> when??
[0:56:23] <lambishly> really?!  When?!
[0:56:24] <%BoxNavy> he probably knows through osmosis
[0:56:26] <Shinny1338> wait what
[0:56:26] <RyuuAoi> Well I'd say so. You want to give the people what they want, but you will never be able to please everyone. DO YOU.
[0:56:27] <Parapattern> If you didn't complain Pat, I'd be super weirded out
[0:56:27] <Holofono> LUL
[0:56:30] <penitentpendant> @thepardack It Takes Two and then trying Ghostrunner with a controller
[0:56:30] <%redthebaron> he must be aware of the game
[0:56:31] <%MidnightBurst12> the aesthetic
[0:56:31] <jorniev> what
[0:56:31] <mattynezz> I assume he saw the sseth video then
[0:56:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jirard the Completionist constantly talks about how much the stream sucks.
[0:56:32] <%BinaryFireball> the fuckers who will be like " Yo welcome to the squad bro! swaud bruh squad bro!!!" will always be positive
[0:56:32] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like he knew what was up
[0:56:32] <Meltgar> Woolie did??? Huh
[0:56:32] <%JoshManVGH> May have heard about it in the zeitgeist
[0:56:33] <%walternatorz> he knew and said nothing
[0:56:34] <%ssjklyco> He probably got tricked into it
[0:56:36] <wolfen091> cause the name kenshi sounds cool
[0:56:36] <Brandon__Brando> when?
[0:56:37] <mattynezz> No way he played it
[0:56:37] <%Dunmarkh> Because ninjas
[0:56:38] <yourliteraldog> Did he do off stream
[0:56:39] <aiutare47> he probably knew it wasnt for you
[0:56:39] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe not 1st hand knowledge
[0:56:39] <RyuuAoi> BECAUSE WOOLIE
[0:56:40] <jorniev> HE PLAYED IT?
[0:56:42] <%Garthunox> and he didnt stop you?
[0:56:42] <LunarRemix> Maybe he thought he was another game
[0:56:43] <illtima> I'm watching mostly you, Woolie, and Max and I'd say the three of you are pretty open when it comes to voicing your opinion. but like, you're really not the *biggest* Twitch stars, so who knows
[0:56:44] <+OwlLightningMage> It was really obvious that you wouldn't like it LUL
[0:56:44] <lambishly> When?
[0:56:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Well that's gonna be a fun 30 minutes on the podcast LUL
[0:56:45] <%sleeplessmetro> This will be a nice Podcast topic
[0:56:48] <ullyzeez> he sa the seth vid probably
[0:56:49] <+remdiel> I dont follow "green haired streamers", i get the feeling that those would be the ones to over hype how well they are feeling.
[0:56:50] <Louie_Salmon> Just like Pat got tricked
[0:56:50] <samazam94> he probably just heard about it second hand
[0:56:56] <%JoshManVGH> Did Shy ever do a bug video on Kenshi?
[0:56:58] <+OwlLightningMage> That podcast is going to be fucking lit
[0:56:59] <lambishly> I'm excited for monday
[0:57:00] <%bevyrage> monster? y'mean gunster?
[0:57:06] <T_Sasquatch> woolie is very aware of what he likes and doesnt like, almost to a fault
[0:57:07] <%BoxNavy> THE fortnite jermaVenus
[0:57:07] <%cylish> So no kenshi
[0:57:08] <%the22cstomp> YEAH FORTNUT
[0:57:10] <HeroToxiko> he was aware woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:57:10] <%MidnightBurst12> post-apocalyptic samurai probably pulls a lot of people in
[0:57:11] <RWLJr98> "I don't want to play fortnite"
[0:57:17] <+aogman> kids aren't gonna murder themselves pat
[0:57:18] <Saltmeisterr> man i love the enemy cast of gungeon
[0:57:22] <%darklordfodder> I'm so bad at enter the gungeon
[0:57:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I might draw some ire for this but Sseth doesn't strike me as a particularly good person, or at least his viewers certainly don't
[0:57:26] <+Aleate> Fortnite YEAH we bout to get down
[0:57:26] <jorniev> just play some ULTIMA 6
[0:57:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Knife those farts
[0:57:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Why no more Hitman? lost interest in it?
[0:57:30] <Broken_Sonex> @T_Sasquatch I would say to a fault
[0:57:30] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt do you actually WANT to play fornite?
[0:57:38] <julrave> Pat did you try the wizard spellcasting battle royale?
[0:57:43] <+ScottishMadJacko> passives are the best
[0:57:44] <Brandon__Brando> not going to lie left when you started playing because I knew it was going to burn down
[0:57:47] <Louie_Salmon> That's always how it is, you can only hold the one active
[0:57:51] <+ScottishMadJacko> damn
[0:57:51] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you ever consider streaming some old Castlevania games or Megaman?
[0:57:51] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt also got a blood vendor too
[0:57:52] <%the22cstomp> pat is addicted to fortnite
[0:57:53] <RyuuAoi> Fuck Fortnight. Apex
[0:57:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> fuuuuuuck
[0:57:54] <+CelioHogane> Dammm
[0:57:57] <+OwlLightningMage> Who doesn't like passive upgrades
[0:57:57] <penitentpendant> Goin' strong in Fortnite,
[0:57:59] <yourliteraldog> Dunking on the children
[0:57:59] <%W1nterTitan> I'm glad you like it?
[0:57:59] <%sleeplessmetro> well that was fast
[0:58:00] <maskedmook> Passive upgrades are the best
[0:58:00] <NeonBleu> well damn
[0:58:01] <rosysyntax> @GarbageNirvana I also got this vibe, and I cannot fully explain it.
[0:58:01] <+funya_rinpa> Watching Pat play Fortnite has been igniting an interest in me and I hate it
[0:58:02] <+glgzephyr> they got him
[0:58:03] <%cache_22> Pat should dye his hair blue.
[0:58:03] <SomeOtherNeb> any interest in playing the new Isaac DLC? @PatStaresAt
[0:58:04] <+CelioHogane> @RyuuAoi nah fuck Apex
[0:58:04] <Saltmeisterr> so u might be able to afford it

[0:58:22] <%Garthunox> The only other streamers i watch outside of you woolie and max bitch about Among Us not getting updated fast enough, despite being a team of five people and the bs they need to go through on to patch it on multiple platforms
[0:58:25] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[0:58:26] <lil_drummer2552> What made you jump into Fortnite so "late"?
[0:58:27] <%MidnightBurst12> Apex is great

[0:58:32] <%the22cstomp> new isaac is very cool
[0:58:32] <Clundy> Is Pat aging in reverse?
[0:58:39] <%0rond> is it bad I was lowkey hoping you'd quit fortnite when the new new skins were announced? @PatStaresAt
[0:58:40] <Shacklebox> Be careful pat, there's been over 200 divorces that list fortnite as a reason for separation. It's possible
[0:58:44] <s1rcuit> Isaac's too depressing for me honestly
[0:58:45] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt tried For Honor since its release?
[0:58:47] <Broken_Sonex> You Chug Jugging with the big boys now Pat? @PatStaresAt
[0:58:48] <RyuuAoi> @clundy Yes
[0:58:50] <%Monkeyweed21> why no Hitman 2?
[0:58:55] <+aogman> disco elysium final cut is out
[0:58:56] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:58:57] <T_Sasquatch> imagine hacing to depend on among us for your livelihood LUL
[0:58:58] <+glgzephyr> that's honestly not a lot....
[0:58:59] <yourliteraldog> Really?
[0:59:00] <PatVA_> sorry it's been a while, any reason why you arent interested in isaac?
[0:59:00] <Holofono> only 200?
[0:59:01] <s1rcuit> @Shacklebox I saw that earlier
[0:59:03] <%CalderGaming> that's not a lot given the playerbase imo
[0:59:10] <balthazar758> lol
[0:59:15] <Saltmeisterr> thats a mimic
[0:59:17] <lloyddboy> pick the brown
[0:59:21] <benjiFG> always middle floor
[0:59:21] <+FiresideInternetCafe> don't get brown chest right?
[0:59:22] <+glgzephyr> @CalderGaming or the number of divorces lmao
[0:59:23] <+FoolsArcade> Hey Pat what do you think about Rogue Legacy 2? The first one was a bit meh for me but the 2nd is dope and has a lot more to do even though its just in early access
[0:59:24] <+lordericter> always go sewer
[0:59:24] <xcompleasedad> Go to middle floor
[0:59:25] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt fuck it pick the locks homie
[0:59:27] <%Monkeyweed21> lockpick the brown @PatStaresAt
[0:59:28] <Saltmeisterr> im pretty sure thats a mimic
[0:59:28] <Link232> Get the key, lockpick, and if you fail just go to Oubliette
[0:59:28] <%redthebaron> i generally lockpick the worst one
[0:59:28] <penitentpendant> Save the keys for the secret floor
[0:59:29] <%g4mejoy> I think the double heart costs less than you would gain from using the vampire lady twice
[0:59:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Common chest are never worth a key
[0:59:30] <%Garthunox> always middle
[0:59:30] <%Nekros4442> always middle floor right?
[0:59:31] <Shacklebox> Pat is speedrunning divorce any % fortnite assisted
[0:59:31] <+ScottishMadJacko> I dunno, I hate pilot
[0:59:33] <Saltmeisterr> the green chest
[0:59:33] <%g4mejoy> Don't quote me on that tho
[0:59:34] <fidget_exclamation_mark> check if the health is cheaper than what you'd get for sacing health
[0:59:35] <ergulor> ,idle floor always
[0:59:36] <rosysyntax> risk it for the biscuit
[0:59:38] <DudeDern> @patstaresat what makes a rogue-like good?
[0:59:40] <$dalmek> shoot once and see
[0:59:43] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat did you ever play Godfall? It's half off right now, but still not sure if worth.
[0:59:45] <xcompleasedad> More opportunities to get Perfect Boss items
[0:59:46] <%darklordfodder> I want to like Gungeon, but every time I start playing it I just want to go back to isaac
[0:59:47] <Inazuma_KICK> shoot it and find out!
[0:59:48] <+RushUnplugged> you can shoot them once and it's safe
[0:59:49] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Are you sure? the top kind of looks like eyes
[0:59:50] <%BoxNavy> good synergies
[0:59:50] <%solracc25> lock pick the shitty chest
[0:59:52] <cybz99> Spelunky
[0:59:52] <Brandon__Brando> you hate fortnite because the internet tells you to
[0:59:52] <%Dr_DangerPhD> sewer always
[0:59:52] <Meltgar> Green is better than blue but not red right?
[0:59:54] <%captain_thickthighs> say pat what you think of outriders buy or wait?
[0:59:54] <%TheLakinessMonster> Style
[0:59:57] <CursedNobleman> music and gameplay
[0:59:58] <ergulor> variety
[0:59:58] <Saltmeisterr> my bad
[0:59:59] <CursedNobleman> thats all i want
[1:00:00] <Shacklebox> Diversity
[1:00:01] <+ScottishMadJacko> fun gameplay and unique upgrades
[1:00:03] <%DappercatEsquire> Power economy is a huge part of a roguelike being fun.
[1:00:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Feel is not number one
[1:00:07] <+RushUnplugged> key open the green chest, lockpick the brown
[1:00:07] <lloyddboy> B U L L E T
[1:00:08] <T_Sasquatch> gameplay :)
[1:00:08] <%BoxNavy> b u l l e t
[1:00:09] <Parapattern> VERY Hot Girls
[1:00:10] <Louie_Salmon> b u l l e t
[1:00:11] <yourliteraldog> Down time between runs is also important
[1:00:13] <+lordericter> B-U-L-L-E-T
[1:00:14] <Giztech> the loop isn't a chore
[1:00:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Diversity is way more important
[1:00:16] <%Bailey__gaming> Kendo was bad I'm guessing?
[1:00:18] <+remdiel> Constant feel of advancement.
[1:00:19] <%captain_thickthighs> you learn from your deaths i think is important
[1:00:19] <RetributionP> no reason to not shoot a chest once
[1:00:20] <%Ghufufin> fun core gameplay loop that is very repeatable
[1:00:22] <%solracc25> lock pick the lesser one and use the key
[1:00:25] <lloyddboy> they do
[1:00:27] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH B U L L E T
[1:00:28] <Meltgar> Yes
[1:00:29] <Mr_Rakjo> sometimes
[1:00:29] <%g4mejoy> Rarely
[1:00:30] <+lordericter> rarely
[1:00:31] <%redthebaron> i think they do
[1:00:32] <penitentpendant> I believe so
[1:00:33] <+TungstenViper> Game feel is the primary thing
[1:00:35] <%redthebaron> bullet
[1:00:35] <%Broand> Big disagree, more important is the metagame
[1:00:36] <%Garthunox> sometimes
[1:00:36] <Saltmeisterr> Yes
[1:00:37] <%bassoontyphoon> rarely
[1:00:38] <ergulor> they can
[1:00:38] <+lordericter> you got like 12% chance
[1:00:39] <Saltmeisterr> sometimes
[1:00:39] <Brandon__Brando> for me decision making
[1:00:40] <s1rcuit> dammit, I'm playing Gungeon and got a red chest mimic that dropped the fucking box
[1:00:40] <+glgzephyr> I've never seen it myself
[1:00:40] <%the22cstomp> B U L L E T
[1:00:44] <+OwlLightningMage> @Bailey__gaming Pat hated literally everything about it LUL
[1:00:47] <casualcthulhu11> sometimes
[1:00:48] <s1rcuit> I do too
[1:00:59] <RWLJr98> blam
[1:01:00] <ChungusQuest> All the best roguelikes and roguelites allow for individual runs to feel almost like completely different games
[1:01:04] <%BoxNavy> Bullet.
[1:01:10] <%AzureGale> BULLET
[1:01:14] <Noogiez> yo
[1:01:17] <+glgzephyr> man, looking at this game makes me want to boot up Touhou.
[1:01:33] <%the22cstomp> bullet
[1:01:36] <RWLJr98> that pigeon looks like me, minus the pigeon Kappa
[1:01:39] <1matheuw> wait was kenshi yesterday?
[1:01:47] <SilverFeng> B U L L E T
[1:01:49] <rosemon5001> i know your opinion on the new isaac update but the amount of changes even before the new content is huge
[1:01:52] <Link232> Coverless Gatling Gull is always the worst
[1:01:53] <%redthebaron> @1matheuw no it was today
[1:01:53] <balthazar758> boolet
[1:01:57] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I hope you don't get too anxious over today's stream, I think you gave it an honest look at it, it just wasn't for you...
[1:01:59] <RWLJr98> it was today but he hated it
[1:02:00] <Meltgar> I think this is the easiest boss for the Extra health sloth
[1:02:02] <@SoFarFetched> @1matheuw it was one hour ago.
[1:02:02] <$dalmek> nice
[1:02:03] <Meltgar> *slot

[1:03:56] <rosemon5001> it literally has it
[1:04:01] <islandsunn> The mystery is half the fun
[1:04:01] <Saltmeisterr> the go through enemies
[1:04:02] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm so excited for the podcast.
[1:04:04] <%JoshManVGH> Notebooks! Are fucking cool
[1:04:05] <%AzureGale> The salt flows
[1:04:06] <%W1nterTitan> passive
[1:04:07] <%bassoontyphoon> piercing is gooood
[1:04:08] <yourliteraldog> Worthit
[1:04:08] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 He added it, right?

[1:04:13] <ergulor> like detailed not

[1:04:22] <casualcthulhu11> sell more health
[1:04:22] <RWLJr98> @PatStaresAt Did you watch Godzilla vs. Kong?
[1:04:22] <%TheLakinessMonster> In Issac's defense, this game is built on puns.
[1:04:23] <Imbetweenjobs_> issac got that new update
[1:04:23] <+CelioHogane> Buy the health and sell it to the vampire girl.
[1:04:24] <%solracc25> yes
[1:04:25] <1matheuw> tell that to doom rl
[1:04:26] <Supermuzzy> He will suck more blood, he just says that sometimes
[1:04:26] <lloyddboy> SPOOKY
[1:04:27] <benjiFG> You have one more health to give
[1:04:27] <jellssssss20> The new Isaac just came out didn’t it? Is it any good?
[1:04:28] <%walternatorz> synergy
[1:04:28] <Meltgar> SPOOKY
[1:04:28] <+funya_rinpa> spooky
[1:04:29] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt you know you cant unlock shit in isaac if you have mods running so if you want an item description mod then you have to go and fuck yourself
[1:04:30] <yourliteraldog> bullet spooky
[1:04:31] <%the22cstomp> S P O O K Y
[1:04:33] <+FiresideInternetCafe> LMAO
[1:04:33] <%Nekros4442> nice synergy lol
[1:04:34] <+OwlLightningMage> SPOOKY
[1:04:34] <+ScottishMadJacko> thats amazing
[1:04:35] <%0rond> S P O O K Y
[1:04:36] <%Vyskus> also there's like, 700 items or some shit now??
[1:04:37] <CursedNobleman> SPOOKY.
[1:04:37] <%redthebaron> @PatStaresAt you can sell health again if you talk to her one more time
[1:04:38] <+RushUnplugged> S P O O K Y B U L L E T
[1:04:38] <%bassoontyphoon> SPOOKY
[1:04:40] <+remdiel> @Vyskus and Hades? Hades is just all around horny.
[1:04:41] <%AzureGale> SPOOKY
[1:04:41] <%Bailey__gaming> SPOOK
[1:04:42] <s1rcuit> the letter gun has a sick synergy with something that makes it unlock chests
[1:04:43] <Saltmeisterr> S P O O K Y
[1:04:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> lowercase r is such a hilarious gun
[1:04:44] <MoonKing> Edmund hates Isaac players, but most of all himself
[1:04:51] <rosemon5001> @glgzephyr the notebook was allready there but it was more refined after it
[1:04:55] <balthazar758> 2spooky
[1:05:00] <%BoxNavy> its so fun :)
[1:05:01] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:05:02] <Madovir> you talked about that mod before on the podcast
[1:05:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Risk of Rain 2 also has this feature
[1:05:08] <DirtyMiser> I really liked Hades, Risk of Rain 2, and Slay the Spire
[1:05:12] <jellssssss20> I used mods and could
[1:05:13] <%DappercatEsquire> BoI w/o platinum god is masochism
[1:05:16] <%g4mejoy> You could milk out extra cash
[1:05:17] <dan_g_v> what is that sound? excitement and joy at playing vidjagaims?!
[1:05:19] <+ScottishMadJacko> like kenshi is trash?
[1:05:20] <yourliteraldog> Has Edmund ever explained the poo and pee stuff
[1:05:21] <casualcthulhu11> more
[1:05:22] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Half the fun of Isaac for me is committing so something I don't know what it does 🤷
[1:05:25] <%g4mejoy> If you bought the full heart and got bit twice
[1:05:35] <Blank9> noita got a lot of new stuff too, last major update hit 2 days ago
[1:05:38] <+HollywoodZach> That's not true. I used description mod and item mods and unlocked all of the stuff.
[1:05:38] <Louie_Salmon> Just know every item after playing the game for 10 years, then you don't need to see the item descriptions.
[1:05:40] <Saltmeisterr> favorite zone time
[1:05:41] <%Monkeyweed21> It feels great on controller tho
[1:05:41] <Madovir> ror2 could use some auto aim on pad
[1:05:46] <T_Sasquatch> i would own hades if they thought the ps4 was worthy to have it
[1:05:47] <penitentpendant> In many ways, Chat is an Eldritch Abomination, so that we give Insight at least on brand
[1:05:47] <julrave> I play 3 characters in RoR2 because of that lol
[1:05:50] <%bassoontyphoon> risk of rain 2 has the most anime final boss fight in any game ive ever played its sick
[1:05:56] <+Carquar> Risk of Rain feels like it's missing something. It just feels weird and empty
[1:05:56] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:06:02] <%Vyskus> is outriders like, actually good? I'm jaded on schlooters
[1:06:06] <julrave> mercenary, engineer, and huntress are the only ones that feel good on controller
[1:06:06] <BurdRightsActivist> isn't isaac out today?
[1:06:09] <Saltmeisterr> OHH
[1:06:12] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 Okay, so if I'm a returning BoI player and I look at an item in the codex or whatever, will it tell me what it actually does, or will it give me a half-assed "clever" three word description?
[1:06:12] <Saltmeisterr> 100 GOLD
[1:06:15] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @Blank9 Was that on the main branch? I can never tell when new stuff drops because I'm on beta
[1:06:16] <yourliteraldog> Outriders is good
[1:06:19] <Saltmeisterr> thats rare
[1:06:20] <Louie_Salmon> @bassoontyphoon So did risk of rain 1, in it's own way
[1:06:21] <%BoxNavy> @BurdRightsActivist it is. pat doesnt like isaac
[1:06:23] <lloyddboy> @PatStaresAt have you tried Griftlands? it's another slay the spire-like made by the folks that did Don't Starve but sci-fi
[1:06:26] <+ScottishMadJacko> I wish ror2 felt better in general, the first one actually felt good
[1:06:35] <balthazar758> boo
[1:06:37] <%bassoontyphoon> @Louie_Salmon true
[1:06:38] <%DappercatEsquire> @Vyskus Depends on what you're looking for. It's like a jankier playing Mass Effect 2.
[1:06:42] <Louie_Salmon> @glgzephyr Yeah just the vague descriptions
[1:06:47] <Blank9> @TheDrugWeCallWifi Yeah, it's called the Epilogue Update.
[1:06:51] <+UberWolfman> wow Kenshi looks sick
[1:06:57] <%BoxNavy> puking is pretty cute i guess
[1:06:57] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt btw the lowercase are is voiced by the composer Doseone
[1:06:59] <%Vyskus> @DappercatEsquire honestly that sounds great
[1:06:59] <+glgzephyr> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, those were never helpful
[1:07:01] <%the22cstomp> this roguelike probably has the most charm out of any roguelike
[1:07:08] <%Bailey__gaming> I wonder if pat would like LOOPZ hero
[1:07:13] <PatVA_> how come you just dont learn over time what items you like and don't? I remember watching and at a glance you remembered like the laser item vaguelly. Some items are straight up blunt about what they do.
[1:07:15] <T_Sasquatch> @Vyskus imagine borderlands but lower budget
[1:07:20] <DudeDern> S n i p e d
[1:07:28] <thepardack> @Bailey__gaming He does not like the Loop Hero
[1:07:28] <1matheuw> time to restart the run
[1:07:35] <%TheLakinessMonster> @UberWolfman not for the first few hours.
[1:07:36] <Saltmeisterr> was that a muncher?
[1:07:38] <benjiFG> scouter increases damage
[1:07:43] <%Deft_Thought> I love Gungeon but I was terrible at the game
[1:07:45] <Meltgar> Blue GETS THE CLIP
[1:07:45] <+willsg98> hey there, just stopping by to say hi. i need to go sleep. Have fun with whatever you're doing!
[1:07:47] <+glgzephyr> @PatVA_ That used to be possible for me, but now there are HUNDREDS of items
[1:07:49] <%Deft_Thought> Never managed to make any significant progress
[1:07:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> So that synergy doesn't do anything besides make the gun spell different words lol
[1:08:02] <Saltmeisterr> it does yeah
[1:08:19] <+ScottishMadJacko> what does curse do in gungeon?
[1:08:20] <%DappercatEsquire> @DappercatEsquire From the demo, there feels like there's gonna be quite a bit room to play with builds. Skills don't feel like they're as periodic as Destiny, more like something you can build around. Try out the demo, progress carries over to retail.
[1:08:22] <%luftraumm1> wait
[1:08:25] <PatVA_> @glgzephyr i can see that i suppose
[1:08:27] <%asgard147> You'll be what?
[1:08:28] <%luftraumm1> gungeon?
[1:08:28] <+tetraes> just got here so what happened to kenshi?
[1:08:30] <+lordericter> SPOOKY
[1:08:32] <%walternatorz> and?
[1:08:33] <%W1nterTitan> WOth
[1:08:33] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[1:08:35] <Parapattern> I'll be a sun of a G-U-N
[1:08:35] <Saltmeisterr> curse is such a great mechanic
[1:08:39] <%Monkeyweed21> it also increases damage
[1:08:39] <$dalmek> I think the gun has the MOST synergies, and they're all different words
[1:08:39] <Parapattern> *son
[1:08:40] <%BoxNavy> unironically a good synergy
[1:08:41] <%g4mejoy> I think it boosts damage with each new word learned
[1:08:42] <Shacklebox> you get more bullets per shot
[1:08:43] <Meltgar> Didn't they get like a small damage boost?
[1:08:43] <yourliteraldog> It worth a giggle
[1:08:46] <%darklordfodder> kenshi broke him
[1:08:48] <Meltgar> Like, MINIMAL boost
[1:08:51] <%Vyskus> some of the words are different length then B U L L E T
[1:08:51] <julrave> is there a mod for gungeon for a permanent scouter lol
[1:08:52] <ergulor> yeah those are the synergys for the lowercase R
[1:08:53] <+OwlLightningMage> @tetraes Pat hated literally everything about it LUL
[1:08:54] <jorniev> kenshi
[1:08:56] <rosemon5001> @glgzephyr booted it up just now and yes it shows what it does
[1:09:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @DappercatEsquire Devs have been upfront on what they're about, too.
[1:09:15] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 Fucking SICK. Excited to get back in in that case
[1:09:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> some of the synergies for lowercase r actually do stuff but not this one lmao
[1:09:42] <Saltmeisterr> scouter increases curse by 1
[1:09:45] <Retrash> lower case r synergy actually more than doubles its damage
[1:09:48] <DudeDern> The quest for better guns
[1:09:50] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 Thank you for actually checking that out btw, that's above and beyond the call of chat
[1:09:57] <+Aleate> Man thats one spooky gun
[1:10:12] <%BoxNavy> might need it later :)
[1:10:21] <+glgzephyr> I love this synergy
[1:10:21] <Orenjevel> its s p o o k y
[1:10:30] <Saltmeisterr> red ammo best ammo
[1:10:31] <%AzureGale> That's GHOST
[1:10:33] <%solracc25> mind goblins
[1:10:35] <DudeDern> Thank you for shitting on Issac, it’s validating
[1:10:36] <Meltgar> Wall of pain?
[1:10:36] <+lordericter> wallmonger
[1:10:37] <penitentpendant> @tetraes The game was not intuitive. Then chat went to civil war over "The game is bad and boring" Vs "You just don't get it man" with both sides not being the best behaved.
[1:10:39] <+glgzephyr> THE WALL
[1:10:44] <ergulor> wallmonger
[1:10:44] <Madovir> saving ammo for later isn't an option for pilot
[1:10:44] <asylumkon> wellmonger
[1:10:46] <Saltmeisterr> wallmonger?
[1:10:48] <%YakumoYomi> The Wallmonger always fucks me up
[1:10:48] <%asgard147> What a SPOOKY GHOST gun
[1:10:48] <Madovir> his gun is garbage
[1:10:58] <+glgzephyr> @Meltgar I see no Jigglypuffs here
[1:11:01] <+lordericter> piercing doesn't help much on wall though if rips up the Kill Pillars
[1:11:07] <%darklordfodder> I really need to give this game another shot
[1:11:16] <%g4mejoy> I prefer fighting the pillars, the wall is harder for me to handle
[1:11:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> woah thats a lotta 1s
[1:11:19] <lloyddboy> that EXPLOSION of 1's
[1:11:24] <casualcthulhu11> its really not
[1:11:27] <%BoxNavy> look at them numbers
[1:11:33] <%darklordfodder> I'm just so, so bad at bullet hell anything
[1:11:37] <penitentpendant> Look at that AoE poison

[1:12:49] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 Removed special item system? I don't understand, but I also skipped an expansion, so that might have something to do with it
[1:12:54] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt pat thats a boss killer
[1:12:56] <Saltmeisterr> oh lmao
[1:13:01] <Parapattern> K I L L B O S S

[1:13:43] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Why?
[1:13:43] <%solracc25> spooky
[1:13:46] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what do?
[1:13:48] <%SirGO0SE> the thing about this game that drives me nuts are the invisible walls. i feel like theres not enough information for you to determine where they are
[1:13:51] <%redthebaron> don't be a fool do not touch it
[1:13:51] <casualcthulhu11> pick the lock
[1:13:52] <+glgzephyr> @rosemon5001 I don't even remember there being tiers lmao
[1:13:57] <Saltmeisterr> until u beat the boss
[1:13:58] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Thanks:)
[1:13:59] <Madovir> yes you wait until after the boss
[1:14:03] <+OwlLightningMage> It unlocks stuff
[1:14:07] <ShadeNightz> @SirGO0SE its like that on purpose
[1:14:12] <benjiFG> you should pick it up
[1:14:16] <+lordericter> that secret zone is a fucking nightmare though
[1:14:18] <Meltgar> Yeap
[1:14:19] <DianaTheAscian> ooooo
[1:14:23] <+FiresideInternetCafe> That makes sense
[1:14:23] <casualcthulhu11> pick the lock
[1:14:24] <+lordericter> and it doesn't give good rewards
[1:14:33] <+OwlLightningMage> I've fought the old bullet king once and got wrecked
[1:14:34] <%BoxNavy> help that dying bulllet
[1:14:34] <casualcthulhu11> trash
[1:14:40] <+ScottishMadJacko> remember gun muncher is there
[1:14:45] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt It's annoying when you get to travel ALL the map trying to find that one room carrying that shield key
[1:14:48] <Saltmeisterr> HARDEST BOSS IN THE GAME HERE
[1:14:50] <%californaya> ayyy, it's the flare gun, from the Old Country
[1:14:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't think I've ever beaten this guy
[1:14:56] <Saltmeisterr> WISH STREAMER LUCK
[1:14:59] <+glgzephyr> those bullets are ADORABLE
[1:15:01] <+Aleate> :|
[1:15:01] <Mattais88> The red-green-yellow colour palette on the character makes me think Bowser Jr is running around with a gun.
[1:15:03] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Jeez this poor boss
[1:15:11] <%solracc25> spooky
[1:15:11] <Louie_Salmon> Oh man is this a nonbo with ghost bullets?

[1:15:45] <T_Sasquatch> i feel liike im playing an unupdated guneon because ive never even seen these types of tiles in the game
[1:15:48] <casualcthulhu11> dont forget the shield
[1:15:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you forgot a chest
[1:15:58] <Saltmeisterr> Gamma ray is alright
[1:15:59] <+OwlLightningMage> This is a secret area
[1:16:02] <Parapattern> "Eh! I'm reloadin' here!"
[1:16:03] <ShadeNightz> alien sidearm actually good though
[1:16:06] <+Dova573> I wish gama ray would turn enemies into hulks
[1:16:11] <+lordericter> yeah unless you get Chief Master the sidearm is shit
[1:16:15] <+glgzephyr> the gun names are hidden by pat's face, right?
[1:16:21] <Meltgar> SNOWGUN LUL
[1:16:24] <+glgzephyr> snowballer is baller
[1:16:28] <+lordericter> the snowballer is worse tho
[1:16:29] <reddpop_> so pat beat kenshi?
[1:16:31] <s1rcuit> I DON"T

[1:16:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> ha bowling joke
[1:16:55] <The_Maddness> its a bowling refrence
[1:16:56] <Louie_Salmon> Nugget?
[1:16:58] <%Bailey__gaming> NUGGET
[1:16:59] <%shurtal> NUGGET
[1:16:59] <%Broand> Bowling reference!
[1:17:01] <+ScottishMadJacko> it's nugget
[1:17:02] <Saltmeisterr> turkey also blocks shoots
[1:17:04] <+glgzephyr> the snowballer is fine
[1:17:06] <Meltgar> Good to push enemies right?
[1:17:08] <casualcthulhu11> its ok
[1:17:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Damage bad
[1:17:10] <%g4mejoy> Snowballer is alright, the freeze is nice
[1:17:10] <ergulor> is pretty bad
[1:17:11] <Meltgar> Or freeze them?
[1:17:12] <reddpop_> @T_Sasquatch classic run. love to see it
[1:17:16] <spyrashnz> Hey a turkey
[1:17:16] <casualcthulhu11> freeze is usefull
[1:17:17] <ergulor> low damage and high knockback
[1:17:20] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt turkey also blocks enemy bullets
[1:17:21] <+OwlLightningMage> It freezes enemies but damage bad
[1:17:22] <benjiFG> the freeze is useful
[1:17:22] <+lordericter> snowballer just doesn't do freeze as fast as a lot of the ice weapons unless you get synergies
[1:17:24] <DudeDern> I forgot do statues stack in this game? (for example poison and burning at the same time)
[1:17:26] <ergulor> freeze is good tho
[1:17:30] <+Dova573> is good for the easy floors
[1:17:32] <%Dr_DangerPhD> good as a off hand weapon or in rooms with pits
[1:17:38] <+glgzephyr> HA
[1:17:46] <+vaderxyz1970> just joined what happened to Kenshi?

[1:18:08] <penitentpendant> All hail the freeze status
[1:18:09] <casualcthulhu11> kenshi died for our sins
[1:18:11] <+glgzephyr> I just HATE it when the enemies are frozen and can't do anything LUL
[1:18:15] <+OwlLightningMage> He refunded it live on stream LUL
[1:18:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Damn
[1:18:26] <+glgzephyr> Kenshi fans out here hating on the Snowballer
[1:18:46] <+Dova573> are enemies hp bars new? or an item he got

[1:19:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is that Carrion?
[1:19:34] <%bassoontyphoon> oh lord what is that
[1:19:34] <casualcthulhu11> daruma

[1:20:01] <BRBN310> etf
[1:20:05] <%SirGO0SE> wus dat smell
[1:20:07] <+Dova573> I love that I have beat all the characters stories and still seeing new shit like the scouter
[1:20:07] <Meltgar> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD PAT Kappa
[1:20:08] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> I didnt know they added that
[1:20:09] <Siconia> That's carrion 100%
[1:20:09] <+Infeirno23> @dunmarkh it def isnt a game for everyone so thats understandable
[1:20:10] <+OwlLightningMage> @dork_doggler Pat hated it. He refunded it
[1:20:12] <$dalmek> did you play after the Gungeons and Draguns update?
[1:20:12] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[1:20:18] <%BoxNavy> chat if you leave a key that spawned on the ground one is guaranteed to spawn in the shop right?
[1:20:20] <%Ghufufin> same color scheme and style as carrion
[1:20:21] <%redthebaron> i always thought it was a akira reference
[1:20:21] <DudeDern> This gun rules
[1:20:23] <The_Maddness> It was in before Carrion was a thing
[1:20:24] <%dork_doggler> @OwlLightningMage lamo
[1:20:25] <%g4mejoy> It's from before Carrion though, pretty sure
[1:20:27] <Saltmeisterr> nah this was before carrion
[1:20:35] <+Dova573> mutation is not new though
[1:20:39] <+glgzephyr> he just walked right into that one
[1:20:51] <+spinalwizard> prototype?
[1:20:52] <+glgzephyr> PAT DON'T RESTART GOD
[1:20:53] <+Dova573> Pretty sure is an akira refference
[1:20:53] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:20:55] <Meltgar> The numbers kinda confuse
[1:21:00] <%dork_doggler> What's Pat's completion on this game? He have paradox yet? The guy Paradox unlocks?
[1:21:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Rewind time :)
[1:21:14] <penitentpendant> It's been a while, I thought you'd get the bullet for the stage as long as you dont' get hit INSIDE the boss encounter?
[1:21:17] <$dalmek> @BoxNavy I don't remember exactly but I think they got rid of that, and just made keys more likely in general? (it's been 2 years so I might be wrong)
[1:21:19] <The_Maddness> since when does damage numbers spray off of enemies like that?
[1:21:23] <%MelBrooksKA> psaBig psaGoblin
[1:21:23] <%g4mejoy> Neither, dork_doggler
[1:21:28] <+glgzephyr> Pat you are multiple bosses in. The time for restarting passed a LONG time ago
[1:21:37] <+CelioHogane> @penitentpendant correct
[1:21:43] <%g4mejoy> Or at least he doesn't have the Gunslinger
[1:21:46] <+God_Of_Oreos> @The_Maddness he has the scouter which adds health bars and damage numbers to enemies I think
[1:21:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Turkey almost dead
[1:21:56] <+glgzephyr> it's just your goblins
[1:21:57] <The_Maddness> ah
[1:21:57] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt What's the star at the side of the guns?
[1:22:03] <Sharpevil> Pat, you need to restart. Even if you finish this run, it's tainted. It will never be clean.
[1:22:09] <The_Maddness> @God_Of_Oreos thanks
[1:22:16] <%dork_doggler> Has he built the bullet that kills the past yet?
[1:22:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the Dragun is super easy what are you talking about
[1:22:22] <+glgzephyr> @Sharpevil oh you're *evil*
[1:22:23] <DudeDern> Why not do boss now?
[1:22:23] <%g4mejoy> You should, the Old King's difficulty outweighs the loot
[1:22:28] <%blastyoboots> @Sharpevil You're evil AND sharp
[1:22:39] <jhonxiolonn> can't believe Pat is PLaying Gungeon in this year, how awesome.
[1:22:49] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt its 2 keys
[1:22:55] <%blastyoboots> big blind
[1:23:03] <+CelioHogane> what
[1:23:11] <penitentpendant> I think you can knife him, worst to worse
[1:23:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you are shitting bullets right now
[1:23:17] <%Garthunox> You had enough in RE2, you have enough here
[1:23:18] <+Dova573> huh
[1:23:18] <penitentpendant> Just like Nemesis!
[1:23:19] <+CelioHogane> the what
[1:23:22] <fritz_dacat> what if the boss is laughably easy
[1:23:24] <The_Maddness> What if you need it now?
[1:23:24] <Sharpevil> Personally, I'm just impressed at anyone not playing on easy mode. I can't walk without injecting a big syringe of rainbow mode into my chest.
[1:23:34] <xcompleasedad> 2 keys for necklace
[1:23:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Worry about that when you can beat the lich @PatStaresAt
[1:24:00] <RetributionP> pat you can goblin as long as you want as long as you don't talk about how plane has better stats
[1:24:05] <%Garthunox> the boss might drop a key
[1:24:11] <benjiFG> you're thinking of the ring of mimic friendship
[1:24:12] <Paragon_Sheep> Maybe boss gives one
[1:24:13] <+forebringer> Hope for key on boss
[1:24:13] <+glgzephyr> I feel like the combo is probably dead
[1:24:13] <Sharpevil> Time to hunt for the secret room?
[1:24:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Rainbow mode is broken
[1:24:14] <Saltmeisterr> ah truw
[1:24:14] <magiclottie> @PatStaresAt hopefully the boss drops a key
[1:24:23] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:24:28] <+OwlLightningMage> Rainbow mode is the games easy mode
[1:24:30] <PatVA_> LUL
[1:24:33] <+glgzephyr> sick
[1:24:34] <%captain_thickthighs> thats a sound bite
[1:24:54] <Sharpevil> Yes, rainbow mode is absolutely a difficulty modifier
[1:24:58] <%dork_doggler> Rainbow mode + final secret character is fucking ridiculous
[1:25:04] <Saltmeisterr> health always worth
[1:25:18] <Saltmeisterr> EASY BOSS
[1:25:26] <eristhanewood> He gave up on Kenshi?
[1:25:29] <+OwlLightningMage> EASY BOSS
[1:25:29] <%dork_doggler> HOW DO YOU TAKE DAMAGE VERSUS MEDUSA
[1:25:30] <Saltmeisterr> CHOKE
[1:25:34] <%g4mejoy> You're rusty man, don't sweat it
[1:25:39] <+glgzephyr> lul
[1:25:40] <%AncelDeLambert> you're SUPER tilted
[1:25:43] <+OwlLightningMage> Rust is real
[1:25:44] <raikagelord1> Nice the Akira Arm.
[1:25:45] <T_Sasquatch> maybe my brain is broken but it farts when i see bullet patterns in this game
[1:25:45] <+glgzephyr> This is what I'm here for
[1:25:48] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto tilted
[1:25:48] <%AzureGale> Pat is Tilted Towers
[1:25:49] <julrave> if you blank her screams she stops immediately
[1:25:54] <%Garthunox> ya got complacent
[1:25:59] <CureMode_> im tilted
[1:26:03] <PatVA_> Tilted Towers
[1:26:06] <+OwlLightningMage> @eristhanewood He hated it so much that he refunded it
[1:26:09] <penitentpendant> Didn't know you could get a mimic in the boss room
[1:26:12] <%AncelDeLambert> ... is it shooting boots at you?
[1:26:13] <Sharpevil> And his music was electric
[1:26:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait the podium can be a mimic too?
[1:26:18] <+ScottishMadJacko> hey man, can't expect perfect runs after a break
[1:26:18] <raikagelord1> This is a great game.
[1:26:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> you have 2 blanks you could hunt for the secret room
[1:26:23] <eristhanewood> Wow
[1:26:29] <%Dr_DangerPhD> secret room can have keys
[1:26:30] <The_Maddness> Macho Brace!
[1:26:30] <segychan> @PatStaresAt will you be picking satisfactory back up when the update hits stable?
[1:26:34] <eristhanewood> Mega coward
[1:26:36] <DudeDern> Bard time
[1:26:44] <+MayorRev> who would win? a tactical laser guided orbital strike OR one bullet boi
[1:26:44] <%g4mejoy> Don't think it works for beam weapons
[1:26:58] <Saltmeisterr> could buy the sniper?
[1:27:07] <penitentpendant> @MayorRev Can the bullet parry the orbital strike?
[1:27:15] <Saltmeisterr> it works well with macho brace
[1:27:20] <raikagelord1> I think it does for like the first pip of damage.
[1:27:27] <%dork_doggler> Pat has so many guns, don't tell me he's been opening brown and blue chests
[1:27:27] <+glgzephyr> c'est la vie
[1:27:29] <Sharpevil> It's okay, pat. We'll wait for you to check every section of every wall
[1:27:35] <raikagelord1> Before my PC broke I was working on the beating the Rat.
[1:27:37] <Saltmeisterr> oh thats the elephant gun
[1:27:52] <%Monkeyweed21> SPOONY BARD
[1:27:54] <$Cthulos> Why doesn’t Pat shoot walls in the chest rooms?
[1:27:58] <The_Maddness> Does the lute have a rythm mechanic?
[1:28:00] <Orenjevel> shoulda lockpicked the demon chest
[1:28:00] <Sharpevil> PLAY FREE BIRD
[1:28:02] <raikagelord1> @sharpevil I would. LUL LUL LUL
[1:29:06] <Sharpevil> Now that I think about it... Monster Train absolutely sounds like a pokemon clone
[1:29:07] <+CelioHogane> oh hey the matt bullets
[1:29:25] <Saltmeisterr> SYNERGRACE
[1:29:30] <Saltmeisterr> the bae
[1:29:30] <softbirby> damn did i miss kenshi
[1:29:42] <%captain_thickthighs> menstral gun
[1:30:02] <$Cthulos> Use your dodge rolls for macho brace Pat
[1:30:02] <%dork_doggler> Yeah you're supposed to kill the jammer first
[1:30:10] <$Cthulos> It’s free
[1:30:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I missed Kenshi
[1:30:16] <+glgzephyr> @jeffishype you missed the hardest bounce off we've seen in a while
[1:30:19] <s1rcuit> @jeffishype you did, many frustration
[1:30:21] <+OwlLightningMage> @jeffishype Pat hated it. He returned it on stream.
[1:30:24] <DudeDern> Put out the fire with BLOOD
[1:30:27] <Sharpevil> puppo
[1:30:31] <softbirby> lmao
[1:30:32] <%BoxNavy> doggie
[1:30:32] <%californaya> Pupper!
[1:30:34] <%redthebaron> dog
[1:30:35] <Siconia> D O G G O
[1:30:41] <%redthebaron> better dog actually
[1:30:45] <Saltmeisterr> works with ur lute pat
[1:30:46] <%walternatorz> pat is a disney princess
[1:30:49] <Madovir> zangunf
[1:30:51] <Madovir> gungief
[1:30:51] <Saltmeisterr> it buffs helpers
[1:30:52] <The_Maddness> Cue Otacon crying
[1:30:53] <balthazar758> dog indeed
[1:30:55] <DudeDern> Does lute boost dog?
[1:31:15] <Orenjevel> zangief and turkelmo
[1:31:18] <The_Maddness> It didnt
[1:31:22] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt wolf synergizes with trank gun, huntsman, sniper, awp, hexagun, m1, bow, and teapot
[1:31:24] <%Piemono> I just got here, what killed Kenshi for Pat
[1:31:27] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt lute buffs helpers like Wolf
[1:31:28] <%BoxNavy> i think thats just a general meat pillar and nothing to do with carrion
[1:31:29] <%Garthunox> it is devolver
[1:31:32] <The_Maddness> That gun has been in since the beginning
[1:31:33] <+Dova573> mutation is not new
[1:31:35] <+glgzephyr> I mean, it has a similar color scheme, but I really don't see Carrion in this gun
[1:31:35] <benjiFG> akira reference perhaps
[1:31:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> wiki says it might be a reference to Prototype or Akira
[1:31:43] <lloyddboy> it was in day 1
[1:31:45] <Madovir> it's a coincidence, that gun has been in for years
[1:31:45] <+OwlLightningMage> @Piemono Everything. Literally everything
[1:31:48] <%dork_doggler> CASEY
[1:31:51] <RetributionP> doggo should mix with carrion to make RE doggo
[1:31:52] <Sharpevil> Lute doubles helpers' projectiles' damage while playing
[1:31:55] <%Monkeyweed21> CASEY
[1:31:59] <%Piemono> @OwlLightningMage Got it, thanks
[1:32:01] <raikagelord1> It is an Akira reference
[1:32:14] <+glgzephyr> yeah people are just projecting Carrion onto this gun
[1:32:26] <Saltmeisterr> fight the boss first for a free gun?
[1:32:28] <penitentpendant> @Piemono It was making his TV flash black, it was not that intuitive so he floundered, chat was unhelpful and arguing with itself
[1:32:28] <%dork_doggler> Flesh gun has been in this game since day one
[1:32:30] <%walternatorz> are ther uses for keys aside from chests?
[1:32:35] <Sharpevil> I'm not sure lute actually does anything to wolf, since he doesn't have projectiles.
[1:32:55] <%g4mejoy> Last room had a secret room
[1:33:05] <Retrash> secret room bottom left of the room above the trapdoor room
[1:33:10] <%g4mejoy> One to the far left
[1:33:35] <+RyTYoung> Just unlocked the 4th character in Slay the Spire gang, huzzah! sbfpYeyeye
[1:33:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Biogun is making Pat overconfident, methinks
[1:33:49] <%dork_doggler> Favorite gun

[1:36:14] <Sharpevil> "People in hell want ice water" is what my parents used to tell me when I said I wanted something
[1:36:22] <%blastyoboots> yea the snowballs looked bigger
[1:36:22] <Saltmeisterr> that seems like a good synergy

[1:47:32] <%dork_doggler> NO
[1:47:37] <Retrash> yes!
[1:47:38] <PatVA_> no
[1:47:40] <%dork_doggler> You're already great, a floor will only hurt
[1:47:43] <SaltyAzteca> Floor 4.5
[1:47:46] <Sharpevil> You sell two items and one of those numbered blanks
[1:47:49] <%BoxNavy> :) no yes no yes :)
[1:47:50] <PatVA_> you have to give it a master round
[1:47:53] <Madovir> it has no chests
[1:47:55] <drjohn92> Has Pat played this before?
[1:47:56] <benjiFG> but more shit tho
[1:47:56] <Saltmeisterr> and a master round
[1:47:57] <%Monkeyweed21> that floor has no chests
[1:47:57] <PatVA_> which will remove a full health point
[1:48:14] <Zuzu_Pachulia> it only has a boss, no other chests. so not usually worth
[1:48:26] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[1:48:29] <%AgniBrandt> Wait when did enemies get health bars?
[1:48:31] <+thatbob9001> Those damage number indicators are fun

[1:49:51] <+cowkid222> this game has made me sweat more than any other when a run is close to finishing. It feels so intense.
[1:49:55] <Zuzu_Pachulia> rat took it
[1:49:55] <benjiFG> in the previous room
[1:49:56] <+CelioHogane> It's gone

[1:50:24] <rosemon5001> you can go check the rat note
[1:50:26] <Saltmeisterr> yeah sure :)

[1:51:20] <+KattAndSteven> "What's even a boomerang?"
[1:51:27] <Sharpevil> Please, there could be children in this chat
[1:51:29] <Sharpevil> Bullet Heck
[1:51:30] <dan_g_v> when is Touhou?
[1:51:32] <SaltyAzteca> Lich is piss easy after a few tries, yeah
[1:51:44] <$Dakuu75> we can't all be an alpha supreme gaming chad like One Guy
[1:51:50] <SaltyAzteca> STRIFE
[1:51:55] <+KattAndSteven> the only times I've beaten the lich are when I had Gunther
[1:51:55] <s1rcuit> there's so much going on per gunfight
[1:51:58] <SaltyAzteca> I mean STRAFE
[1:52:00] <%Dunmarkh> Man looking at the schedule, looking forward to next week's kenshi stream
[1:52:00] <Saltmeisterr> STRAFE
[1:52:03] <T_Sasquatch> lmao that gun name
[1:52:05] <Sharpevil> Hey, it's the STRAFE gun. From STRAFE!
[1:52:12] <Saltmeisterr> I love the strafe gun
[1:52:13] <T_Sasquatch> isnt strafe shit ?
[1:52:19] <yottawhat> Hey guys, you remember STRAFE?
[1:52:22] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[1:52:22] <T_Sasquatch> the game i mean
[1:52:24] <+CelioHogane> @Dunmarkh haha nice one
[1:52:25] <Sharpevil> Remember STRAFE? Please buy STRAFE.
[1:52:25] <T_Sasquatch> not the gun
[1:52:26] <Saltmeisterr> cull gun tho
[1:52:33] <+cowkid222> classic STRAFE®
[1:52:41] <Saltmeisterr> cool gun i mean
[1:52:46] <+glgzephyr> I've never even heard of STRAFE
[1:52:49] <+MayorRev> strafe is pretty cool
[1:52:52] <+KattAndSteven> It's STRAFE or... something
[1:52:54] <spicyramengaming> Synergy with Origuni?
[1:52:54] <+glgzephyr> now the word looks weird
[1:53:04] <yottawhat> Why play STRAFE when you can play Ultrakill tho
[1:53:20] <SovPho> because STRAFE is a finished game
[1:53:23] <Saltmeisterr> thats fair pat. bullet hell is really hard
[1:53:30] <Sharpevil> I remember hearing about STRAFE® and thinking it looked pretty cool. But at this point, I can't remember anything about STRAFE® besides it being a retro FPS.
[1:53:35] <+glgzephyr> pat you were making mistakes on floor one
[1:53:36] <benjiFG> than usual

[1:59:38] <Saltmeisterr> the worst part of bullet hell is navigating it
[1:59:44] <Saltmeisterr> cuz its a maze
[1:59:59] <%dork_doggler> And he's in there and we're out here and he';s the sheriff
[2:00:05] <Sharpevil> I'm glad I'm not up here and he's down there and I'm down there and he's the sheriff

[2:00:50] <+OwlLightningMage> @spicyramengaming Pat hates literally everything about it. Uninstalled it
[2:00:54] <SaltyAzteca> Yeah I can understand why LUL @dork_doggler
[2:01:06] <jorniev> @glgzephyr twitter

[2:02:02] <penitentpendant> "It doesn't count until we hit floor 2."
[2:02:09] <Mattais88> Wouldn't that make every run your first run?
[2:02:18] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Restarts don't count as what?
[2:02:46] <jorniev> @spicyramengaming no i was saying i got april fooled and that i was like nooooooo
[2:02:52] <Sharpevil> I always thought the exploding slimes were way cuter than they actually are, because I saw them as having slitted eyes with big yellow cheeks, instead of yellow eyes and eyebrows.

[2:14:20] <ammobasket> BIG W
[2:14:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt to unlock the Gunslinger you need to beat the lich twice in a row
[2:14:37] <benjiFG> it always is
[2:14:41] <%redthebaron> it only closes with some characters i think
[2:14:45] <Saltmeisterr> u can re do it
[2:14:46] <LorcaNomad> talk to fish man
[2:14:48] <Djinnazz> no they don't
[2:14:56] <Sharpevil> I thought you had to beat the lich as the paradox to get the gunslinger
[2:14:57] <Zuzu_Pachulia> its always open to basic 4 chars
[2:15:04] <%redthebaron> like the bullet and the robot can't go in i think
[2:15:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> fuck'

[2:34:24] <+Hyphixsys> @Sharpevil LUL Kappa
[2:34:26] <+allups> King is great
[2:34:30] <+allups> we can all agree on that
[2:34:31] <theyblamedthebeasts> Well there had to be one, I suppose
[2:34:36] <Sharpevil> It's actually Armor King, guys
[2:34:39] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Riight?
[2:34:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Idiots, that's who
[2:34:42] <Sharpevil> They're different characters
[2:34:44] <SunsetJack> King is great but the trailer is kinda bleh.
[2:34:45] <%spitelite> new stage looks really rad
[2:34:57] <Zuzu_Pachulia> R A T S
[2:35:00] <fidget_exclamation_mark> the tekken character?
[2:35:01] <+Hyphixsys> it's all about Mokujin Kappa
[2:35:11] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Youll love the Rat when you fight it
[2:35:19] <Sharpevil> I started playing Tekken for Panda, but I stuck with it for Yoshimitsu
[2:35:19] <nauskills> @PatStaresAt ever thought about trying Challenge mode where it adds multiple modifiers to the rooms?
[2:35:38] <%GarbageNirvana> You're just now getting the arm? dang
[2:35:46] <fidget_exclamation_mark> you finished the game and you still didn't get the replacement arm?!?
[2:35:46] <s1rcuit> yes
[2:35:49] <tolloponik> wow they sped her up really hard
[2:35:50] <Sharpevil> Oh my god, has Pat not fought the sexy rat boss yet?
[2:35:52] <ergulor> yup
[2:35:53] <penitentpendant> King's costume looks like a Black Jack Dealer... with slight bell bottoms

[2:36:26] <Siconia> Pat how have you not done everything in the game yet, are you not god gamer?
[2:36:31] <Saltmeisterr> @MisterRockett WHAT
[2:36:33] <Sharpevil> I'm just excited for you getting to experience the rat for the first time
[2:36:39] <Saltmeisterr> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
[2:36:44] <Retrash> the best item in the game
[2:36:45] <+allups> i haven't beat the game and i chant this game from the havens so I can't complain
[2:36:46] <%darklordfodder> Glad I got the kid to sleep quick enough to catch a good portion of the back part of the stream.
[2:36:47] <ergulor> Clone iirc
[2:36:48] <%MisterRockett> @Saltmeisterr ***
[2:36:50] <fidget_exclamation_mark> a friend :>
[2:36:50] <%DappercatEsquire> @MisterRockett oh shit time to finally play fighting games
[2:36:57] <%blastyoboots> @MisterRockett FIGHT OF GODS X FIGHT OF ANIMALS!????  What an announcement?!?!
[2:36:58] <Saltmeisterr> Clone
[2:37:01] <ergulor> Yeag
[2:37:09] <nauskills> LUL
[2:37:09] <Siconia> Ew
[2:37:12] <Siconia> Delet
[2:37:14] <$lutefiiisk> Kenshi was too hardcore, huh?
[2:37:18] <%kylejefferies> What game are we talking about?
[2:37:21] <ChungusQuest> lol straight into the muncher
[2:37:28] <Siconia> No Kenshi was bad
[2:37:31] <s1rcuit> does the unfinished gun unlock anything if you take it to the gunsmith?
[2:37:38] <tolloponik> for the muncher for sure
[2:37:41] <fidget_exclamation_mark> nope
[2:37:48] <$lutefiiisk> You're bad. Watch The Sseth video to see how it's done.
[2:37:49] <%valriot> FIGHT OF GOD X FIGHT OF ANIMALS GOT ANNOUNCED YEEEEE
[2:37:55] <Saltmeisterr> @s1rcuit u have to 100% the game first
[2:38:00] <+Hyphixsys> bouncy balls
[2:38:01] <Djinnazz> ...
[2:38:03] <Siconia> @lutefiiisk He did
[2:38:07] <%Garthunox> Finishing the Arm Quest gets you the Clone item
[2:38:08] <%kylejefferies> @lutefiiisk No it like wouldn't run properly.
[2:38:10] <Saltmeisterr> then it becomes the finished gun
[2:38:24] <rosemon5001> you get the clone wich lets you start over from the first floor whit everything you have after you die
[2:38:27] <%BoxNavy> @lutefiiisk he did. pat watched the video. he watched it and had to bring it up like 5 times cus people kept telling him to watch it moon2W
[2:38:27] <%darklordfodder> Kenshi doesn't seem like one of those games you just "casually" stream once or twice. Its one of those ones that people who only stream 1-3 games stream.
[2:38:35] <nauskills> @s1rcuit You need to unlock every single guns in the game, then bring it to the Blacksmith, it becomes one of the best gun in the game
[2:38:36] <jorniev> kenshi was made by one guy, no wonder its so jank
[2:38:52] <$lutefiiisk> Ok. He's given it a try, My bad. Not for everyone.
[2:38:52] <Sharpevil> But is the Clone ACTUALLY better than Gunther? I'm not sure.
[2:38:58] <Siconia> WHAT IS THIS RUN
[2:39:00] <Djinnazz> fuck yeah1
[2:39:04] <Saltmeisterr> YO
[2:39:07] <%Broand> He did the face

[2:39:16] <%heartlesshealer> time to botch
[2:39:21] <jorniev> what is that?
[2:39:21] <Siconia> POGGERS CHAMPION
[2:39:24] <theyblamedthebeasts> Very nice
[2:39:26] <RogueMinja> 30.
[2:39:27] <halfmasks> NOW WERE COOKING WITH GAS
[2:39:31] <%kylejefferies> @lutefiiisk If the game didn't crash and run like it was built on Win 95 maybe it would be a good game.
[2:39:35] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt remember u have the sling
[2:39:37] <+max_radical> PAT ROLLED VORPAL
[2:39:41] <$lutefiiisk> @blastyoboots Yuck. Disgusting meme
[2:39:42] <%BoxNavy> 🎈
[2:39:45] <jorniev> that face pat made scared me
[2:39:46] <rosemon5001> literally is @Shackle_Rustyford gives you the ability to get more items more hp and money
[2:39:58] <+Akizea> man the most annoying boss tbh
[2:39:58] <deviljhojho_> its over
[2:39:59] <ergulor> oh this fucker
[2:40:04] <Madovir> he gunned in his pants
[2:40:05] <%heartlesshealer> here's how pat can still lose
[2:40:05] <Sharpevil> @kylejefferies Yes, but Dungeons of Dredmor crashes constantly and runs like it was built on windows 95, and it IS still a good game.
[2:40:06] <$RealThiele> ez
[2:40:08] <Saltmeisterr> damn
[2:40:10] <Saltmeisterr> rip
[2:40:20] <Siconia> Nah Pat got this, ez game
[2:40:24] <%kylejefferies> I have a 3070 and more than capable hardware and Kenshi runs like it can't access my ram.
[2:40:36] <halfmasks> DAMN
[2:40:37] <deviljhojho_> bodied
[2:40:38] <Siconia> ez clap
[2:40:43] <%heartlesshealer> Good job!
[2:40:50] <+allups> this is truly David vs goliath
[2:40:51] <Sharpevil> Ooh. There's a good gun in that bitey boy
[2:40:59] <+allups> was*
[2:41:04] <$RealThiele> 5th element gun
[2:41:11] <+Hyphixsys> Fifth Element Weapon LUL
[2:41:13] <ChungusQuest> ooh, the ZF-1
[2:41:13] <%Shadowpoco> 5th element is rad
[2:41:14] <Siconia> Press the red button
[2:41:21] <Smokin_Fish> David and the Cthulu
[2:41:21] <+allups> i love the fucking film
[2:41:27] <Sharpevil> The best gun for fucking
[2:41:34] <%kylejefferies> @sharpevil Payday 2 runs like a garbage fire and it is a fun game too.
[2:41:40] <%BoxNavy> zangief is blowing into a trumpet
[2:41:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> the fifth element is cum.
[2:41:48] <+Hyphixsys> @allups the only good film he has made, unfortunately, Luc Besson LUL
[2:41:52] <ChungusQuest> Pat is cold-blooded, clean, methodical, and thorough. He would never push the button.
[2:42:00] <%kylejefferies> @rumtumtugnutz i mean kinda.
[2:42:13] <Sharpevil> The fifth element was the friends we made along the way
[2:42:15] <KaiserMario> Fifth Element is like Jojo fanfic
[2:42:55] <Djinnazz> Coulda done it if you had the sheild
[2:42:58] <$RealThiele> Lilu stando: Multipass
[2:43:16] <Sharpevil> Hot take: I like gamestop better as a weird pop culture toy store. I buy most of my games digitally now, and it's more fun to pop in and take a look now.
[2:43:19] <+allups> @Hyphixsys other than probly Lucy ur probly right LUL
[2:43:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> I've seen the movie enough to understand the nuance.
[2:43:26] <Smokin_Fish> kitty
[2:43:26] <Sharpevil> I stopped in at one today, and they had a jojo wallet
[2:43:37] <%Daxalog> I thought you finished the stream last run?
[2:44:07] <$RealThiele> fun game got another run
[2:44:20] <+allups> lol damn ^
[2:44:47] <Sharpevil> @Daxalog He couldn't help himself. He wanted to try just a LITTLE bit of paradox. And then immediately got a viable run.
[2:44:48] <spicystarbursts> speaking of money, you reminded me about fixing that darned elevator
[2:44:48] <Smokin_Fish> I started playing this again like a few days ago what brought you back?
[2:45:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kenshi being a 'broken shitmess' brought Pat back to this cause he was stressed and he likes Gungeon.
[2:45:33] <$RealThiele> spiders fucking suck
[2:45:52] <ergulor> hammer is great
[2:46:21] <lloyddboy> don't reload the ahmmer
[2:46:37] <Djinnazz> ooo, get both
[2:46:42] <Saltmeisterr> 2 HEARTS
[2:46:43] <Djinnazz> no
[2:46:58] <%g4mejoy> Heart Locket and Monster Blood are heart pieces
[2:46:59] <Madovir> don't overdo it with curse
[2:47:03] <Siconia> Damn, no double ended trident-fork
[2:47:07] <%kylejefferies> HAIL SATAN
[2:47:09] <Saltmeisterr> well u wanted health
[2:47:11] <Retrash> stealing from cursula gives you less curse than buying from her @PatStaresAt
[2:47:14] <RogueMinja> Alien engine has a synergy with the zorgun.
[2:47:23] <%g4mejoy> Though maybe the curse isn't worth it for such a long run
[2:47:43] <%kylejefferies> depends how much curse he has.
[2:47:49] <Saltmeisterr> thats 4 max hp tho
[2:47:51] <%kylejefferies> little bit of curse never hurt anyone.
[2:47:56] <fidget_exclamation_mark> you gonna do RnG
[2:47:59] <fidget_exclamation_mark> ?
[2:48:02] <Saltmeisterr> i don't think pat has any curse
[2:48:11] <Sharpevil> Boy, a synergrace would go down real smooth right about now, huh
[2:48:12] <+wasalujaco> lets go king
[2:48:17] <SaltyAzteca> Destroy chests for a chance to heal
[2:48:18] <lloyddboy> bork chest get health
[2:48:19] <%kylejefferies> mimics
[2:48:22] <halfmasks> i think it gives health for breaking chests
[2:48:23] <%g4mejoy> Breaking chests can heal you
[2:48:24] <Retrash> buy first
[2:48:27] <Retrash> then steal
[2:48:34] <Saltmeisterr> better loot drops from breaking chests
[2:48:37] <%kylejefferies> buy then steal
[2:48:56] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:48:58] <Siconia> LUL
[2:48:58] <Chimeraelite> oh jesus
[2:49:01] <Chimeraelite> I just noticed
[2:49:07] <xeros720> Thief 2 gang represent
[2:49:09] <Siconia> DOOR
[2:49:18] <%AzureGale> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR
[2:49:19] <wolfen091> pat, GDQ stream is doing silent hill downpour and it made me think of you
[2:49:21] <rosysyntax> Thief 2 fuckin rules
[2:49:25] <Saltmeisterr> wallmonger time
[2:49:26] <penitentpendant> Ye olde Demon Wall Boss
[2:49:53] <Zetheos> that boss hurts me
[2:50:20] <Saltmeisterr> could do rnd
[2:50:24] <Sharpevil> Door? More like  D-, uh Doork
[2:50:24] <+glgzephyr> nahhhh you're fine
[2:50:26] <+allups> at the risk of sounding stupid. when yall say synergy do u mean in the traditional meaning of the word or like a game mechanic?
[2:50:27] <Saltmeisterr> rng*
[2:50:30] <fidget_exclamation_mark> dang no RnG
[2:50:43] <+glgzephyr> @allups Both, technically
[2:50:52] <+n0rsetradamus> not with that attitude
[2:51:12] <%kylejefferies> @allups picking up certain combinations of items will modify or buff them.
[2:51:15] <$RealThiele> health and armor are in a good spot
[2:51:21] <+allups> @glgzephyr thanks for clearing that up for me LUL
[2:51:23] <+Aleate> I miss the snowball gun
[2:51:26] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt do you want tips on how to navigate bullet hell?
[2:51:32] <+allups> @kylejefferies thanks
[2:51:38] <vile_brand> just do everything perfectly and flawlessly and you'll be fine.
[2:51:41] <lloyddboy> sling'll do him
[2:51:48] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[2:51:53] <Djinnazz> You still have to try High Dragun
[2:52:28] <halfmasks> the shooting-fish in a barrel gun is the kind of humour i like from this game
[2:52:29] <+glgzephyr> do you shoot red bullets?
[2:52:33] <s1rcuit> Yours are usually yellow and heading AWAY from you
[2:52:38] <Sharpevil> Pat, your bullets are the ones that come out of YOUR gun
[2:52:43] <%kylejefferies> @allups Synergies can be as simple as a +10% damage buff or as strange as basically turning gun A into a completely different gun.
[2:52:51] <halfmasks> enemy bullets are almost always red
[2:53:04] <+glgzephyr> yeah honestly just look at a good Touhou player
[2:53:09] <Saltmeisterr> essential theres only a single path that leads to the lich, all other paths either loop around or are dead ends
[2:53:10] <xeros720> somebody's birthday party in there
[2:53:10] <s1rcuit> @halfmasks it's great, I like the Stardew Valley gun, which is just a watering can with a star on, it's actually a good gun
[2:53:23] <+allups> @kylejefferies thanks. dunno how i missed that when i played
[2:53:26] <%kylejefferies> install mod that makes your bullets blue.
[2:53:44] <+glgzephyr> @kylejefferies Ooh, that sounds like it would be pretty
[2:53:50] <%kylejefferies> @allups There were very very few synergies when the game first came out to be honest.
[2:53:55] <Saltmeisterr> u gotta look out for paths which loop like they loop around
[2:54:00] <Djinnazz> the choke
[2:54:11] <theyblamedthebeasts> In Bullet Hell games I never know whether I should stare at my character or the enemies
[2:54:16] <+allups> @kylejefferies o thats probly why, i dont feel to bad then
[2:54:23] <halfmasks> i remember beta version of Enter the Gungeon where the enemy bullets were TINY
[2:54:26] <Djinnazz> CURSE BULLETS
[2:54:30] <%0rond> CASEY
[2:54:30] <+KattAndSteven> oooooooooo

[2:59:10] <Djinnazz> Oh yeah, the new Abe's Odyssy is free tomorrow
[2:59:13] <Vermillion129> that's fine man, kenshi is some wonky stuff that's not for everybody, it just the way it is. just trash the shit outta it
[2:59:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> Trash games deserve trash talk.
[2:59:17] <Siconia> Oh these are gonna be great
[2:59:21] <Zetheos> Oh, dude, watch the Sseth video
[2:59:22] <+bobfriskit> which game is trash?
[2:59:25] <+glgzephyr> these people are DELUSIONAL
[2:59:25] <T_Sasquatch> I want to hear the vitriolic hate because i was legit getting stressed while you were getting stressed LUL
[2:59:30] <ZeSmexyHabib> Why is Pat going to trash Kenshi? I missed out on that part of the stream
[2:59:31] <%LordSDB> THE SETH VIDEO TEACHES NOTHING!
[2:59:35] <Zetheos> keep watching the Sseth video tho
[2:59:35] <Siconia> Dude just watch the Sseth video
[2:59:42] <Siconia> No but watch the Sseth video
[2:59:42] <SovPho> the beginning of the game is nonsense anyways
[2:59:45] <%Dementedpenguin> That's like the second or third time I heard that "Seth" line tonight in this stream
[2:59:46] <+glgzephyr> the sseth video just shows you cool shit
[2:59:47] <$RealThiele> there should be a improvement cycle that has a carrot somewheres without shitting on you
[2:59:48] <Zetheos> entertainment and soothing voices
[2:59:48] <Madovir> internet man said it's good, and that means it's good!!!!!!!!!!
[2:59:48] <penitentpendant> This smells like a meme
[2:59:53] <$KnivesEve> hey nice background
[2:59:54] <Djinnazz> @ZeSmexyHabib it's not that good
[2:59:57] <%Axellogic> Watch it again and it will magically click somehow
[3:00:01] <+allups> yeah one guy opinion isn't ganna help u acclimate to the game
[3:00:05] <Zetheos> it's like all his videos, that's how he do
[3:00:05] <GarbageNirvana> dude's a less funny dunkey who's barely that funny to begin with
[3:00:08] <+razielhex> playing SS13 right now
[3:00:10] <SovPho> if there was literally a dialogue box that said "hey go into the wild and build a little hut" it would be better than the barebones nothing it already is lol
[3:00:13] <Siconia> Don't play SS13
[3:00:21] <T_Sasquatch> Sseth makes good videos
[3:00:27] <+allups> ight ima sleep night yall
[3:00:28] <+razielhex> can't make me not play SS13
[3:00:29] <Zetheos> Sseth is fuckin' hilarious
[3:00:31] <danpc5> he is
[3:00:38] <Chaos_kun> Hey hey people
[3:00:40] <+razielhex> Pat would hate SS13
[3:00:41] <+glgzephyr> Dunkey's last video was pretty good actually
[3:00:42] <Siconia> HE WHAT
[3:00:42] <+Dova573> More funny than donkey
[3:00:47] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:00:48] <Siconia> THAT'S HILARIOUS
[3:00:50] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:00:50] <Zetheos> I haven't watched Dunky since his League videos and he got banned
[3:00:52] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:00:53] <$RealThiele> DEAR RIOT
[3:00:54] <%Daxalog> He didnt even get banned.  It was a 2 week time out.
[3:00:54] <T_Sasquatch> sseth also shilled god hand and god hand porn so I really cannot hate on him
[3:00:55] <+allups> good
[3:00:55] <Tracazoid> LUL
[3:00:57] <AMDBR9S> i remember that
[3:00:58] <Siconia> LUL
[3:00:59] <iosephe> wow
[3:00:59] <+allups> LUL
[3:00:59] <%MisterRockett> The funniest thing about Dunkey is how much he hates turn based RPGs.
[3:01:00] <$RealThiele> I AM A PRO GAMER
[3:01:01] <%GarbageNirvana> okay that's pretty good
[3:01:04] <SovPho> it was a pro gamer moment
[3:01:05] <+glgzephyr> yeah it was pretty great to experience in real time
[3:01:06] <+RushUnplugged> oh dunkey was an asshole? somehow does NOT surprise me at all
[3:01:09] <%Piemono> Oh yeah I forgot about that
[3:01:13] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[3:01:13] <%AzureGale> Your loyalty means NOTHING
[3:01:16] <%g4mejoy> The Gief is STRONG SNORING
[3:01:18] <+allups> dunky us funny tho
[3:01:20] <%Garthunox> Dunkey is... how do i put it without being profane
[3:01:22] <+allups> is*
[3:01:23] <dragoon001914> Dunkey stopped being funny when he stopped doing LoL vids
[3:01:23] <+RushUnplugged> dunkey is cinemasins-levels of bad faith
[3:01:24] <+razielhex> Dunkey's streams are...not good.
[3:01:29] <+glgzephyr> this wallpaper is inferior
[3:01:32] <$RealThiele> dunkey is a person
[3:01:35] <+razielhex> His videos are funny, but his streams are really boring
[3:01:36] <%JoshManVGH> That's some petty shit
[3:01:38] <%Dapper_Cactuar> he was their biggest content creator and he snapped at a feeder. League soon after used one of his jokes in patch notes claiming they came up with the joke to be even more petty LUL
[3:01:43] <Zetheos> @RealThiele truth
[3:01:46] <+OnwardEch0> i tried his stream, zzz
[3:01:47] <T_Sasquatch> reboot looking ass wallpaper
[3:01:48] <dan_g_v> huh
[3:01:50] <+glgzephyr> His most recent video is pretty decent
[3:01:55] <+OnwardEch0> he needs an editor
[3:02:08] <jorniev> kenshi was made by one guy and it shows
[3:02:10] <Siconia> They are all good ass games
[3:02:11] <+glgzephyr> sounds like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[3:02:14] <+allups> stalker 2 looks like a thing'
[3:02:31] <Madovir> call of pripyat is much more stable
[3:02:38] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev I've played a lot of games made by one dude that played a lot better than that one
[3:02:39] <%Puhff> LUL poop
[3:02:42] <TheA1ternative> yeah people are dumb telling you to find a guide
[3:02:45] <%Broand> like 3 minutes in Sseth says  "There's no true objective in kenshi"
[3:02:45] <T_Sasquatch> dunkey is great when youre bored and dont care about the game he is talking about
[3:02:46] <Clundy> If Stalker 2 isn’t just Patholgic 2 with guns I will be very sad
[3:02:47] <%Puhff> gotem
[3:02:53] <$RealThiele> gone to the steam abyss forever
[3:02:55] <+glgzephyr> The one guy excuse no longer flies
[3:02:57] <%Arancet> yeah me either, but i can kinda see the appeal, but it does look awful
[3:02:58] <%Garthunox> even minecraft has a goal
[3:03:06] <T_Sasquatch> fuck donkey for completely spoiling nier automata tho
[3:03:10] <jorniev> @glgzephyr so?
[3:03:15] <@SoFarFetched> @jorniev that doesnt really mean anything if Stardew valley was done by one person as well. It just means he didn't do a good of a job with just himself and needed more people.
[3:03:26] <SovPho> I've said this a few times, but it was this game that took like... 10 years? to develop and it feels like a game that should've come out 10 years ago.
[3:03:28] <%Garthunox> @T_Sasquatch wait how did he spoil it, dm me
[3:03:30] <Siconia> STALKER 2 just needs to be the old STALKER games but more stable and prettier, that's it
[3:03:31] <jorniev> @SoFarFetched and?
[3:03:38] <+ChampionBob> Fuck Donkey for spoiling the monkey fight in Sekiro xD
[3:03:39] <Siconia> Groceries is hell
[3:03:42] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev My point is that "made by one guy" is no longer a valid excuse for bad game
[3:03:48] <+Lutherian90> Lowes is also a grocery store
[3:03:49] <@SoFarFetched> I mean I gave my explanation geefShrug not sure why the "and"
[3:03:49] <lloyddboy> there is no food there
[3:03:51] <Smokin_Fish> I worked at a Rona it was a constant shitshow
[3:03:52] <ThirdPersonPhil> More normies
[3:03:53] <+Lutherian90> There is a Lowes Foods
[3:03:54] <dragoon001914> Hardware stores most customers know what they're looking for.
[3:03:56] <%Dementedpenguin> @jorniev dude you brought up the subject
[3:03:57] <$RealThiele> eventually youll just get a boomer grandpa telling you about his project for 20 minutes
[3:04:00] <T_Sasquatch> @Garthunox no need to dm , he literally showed multiple endings and plot
[3:04:01] <penitentpendant> ...wait what
[3:04:05] <vile_brand> people respect you to some degree?
[3:04:05] <jorniev> @glgzephyr made by one guy AND IT SHOWS thats what i said
[3:04:06] <+AtlasMcCoy> Lowes is a hardware store
[3:04:06] <AMDBR9S> it can be both
[3:04:10] <$Kirby_Sauce> same
[3:04:10] <%bevyrage> lowes is not a grocery store. it's hardware and general surplus
[3:04:10] <Clowns> i've never seen food at Lowes wtf
[3:04:12] <Louie_Salmon> They all sell everything now
[3:04:12] <+MisterAvry> lowes is not a grocery store
[3:04:13] <%Puhff> No
[3:04:15] <Djinnazz> Lowe"s?
[3:04:15] <+Shubreaker> one guy
[3:04:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> People who go into hardware stores know what the fuck they want ALEAYS
[3:04:17] <%kylejefferies> Lowes is a hardware store.
[3:04:18] <+CapnClassix> Had a guy that always came in to Home Depot and shared a Slim Jim with his dog. Like, his dog licked it and the he ate it...
[3:04:19] <+Lutherian90> It's not related to Lowes Home Improvement
[3:04:19] <$RealThiele> it is a hardware store in the US mostly
[3:04:20] <$StrawberryPantsu> *Always
[3:04:21] <%Puhff> NO
[3:04:22] <+RealPT1> so it's the Mount and Blade problem with kenshi
[3:04:22] <+MisterAvry> they sell like paper towels at best
[3:04:24] <%JoshManVGH> Where are you 3/4ths socket wrenches? aisle 5. cool thanks
[3:04:27] <jorniev> @Dementedpenguin i was saying its not GREAT
[3:04:27] <Frog_of_Justic> Not having to do stock rotation is the best
[3:04:29] <Siconia> EVERYONE
[3:04:30] <Clundy> Lows or Lowe’s?
[3:04:33] <sentientvin> lowes sells plants not grocery
[3:04:34] <Clowns> like they have some drinks and candy bars at checkout but no real food
[3:04:42] <lloyddboy> mr feel's got some good home depot stories
[3:04:45] <%kylejefferies> Menards is like a Hardware store with 2 isles of groceries
[3:04:47] <+strifexfair> Mostly professionals go to Lowe’s.
[3:04:50] <%sabertoothzombie> it's not both
[3:04:55] <+CapnClassix> @StrawberryPantsu That is NOT true. I got yelled at so many times because I didn't know what specialty screwdrivers they needed.
[3:05:03] <+AtlasMcCoy> Liquor stores get the fun people who really shouldnt be buying liquor
[3:05:03] <+Stormzcales_Lair> its why managing Walmart so bad, EVERBODY comes in
[3:05:09] <%JoshManVGH> Retail Pharmacy is absolute hell.
[3:05:10] <%Axellogic> I work in a sporting goods retail store we got clothing we got guns we got fishing and sports shit and even games and grills. We get all the crazies
[3:05:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lowes Foods and Lowes Hardware are unrelated.
[3:05:16] <Siconia> Next level is home delivery, people with shit attitudes are so much braver on their own property
[3:05:20] <%Arancet> and walmart doesnt give a shit
[3:05:32] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i once had moms fighting over School supplies man...
[3:05:38] <$RealThiele> ichi is a great protag
[3:05:46] <jorniev> the weirdest thing about kenshi is all the people trying to tell me not to like this piece of shit game that i like
[3:05:47] <+glgzephyr> I mean consider that the most recent one is also the best one
[3:05:57] <%Garthunox> 1 and 3 were the low points
[3:05:58] <%JoshManVGH> Just a smattering if all the worst shit, all over the Wall... mart
[3:05:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lowe's Foods is a supermarket chain in North Carolina.
[3:05:59] <%darklordfodder> You should get in a fight/convo with Super Eyepatch wolf about Yakuza 7
[3:06:01] <Louie_Salmon> Yakuza 7 is a surprisingly fine place to jump in, it really doesn't require knowing much
[3:06:03] <Siconia> LUL
[3:06:10] <Smokin_Fish> I worked in a hardware store it is indeed capable of being just as terrible
[3:06:13] <$RealThiele> oh noooo
[3:06:17] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev No one's telling you not to like it. We're just telling you that it's bad
[3:06:29] <+glgzephyr> and you keep insisting otherwise
[3:06:29] <Siconia> Probably good that they didn't watch the stream LUL
[3:06:31] <ZeSmexyHabib> @jorniev Same honestly, glad they are making a second one though
[3:06:34] <$TallYoda08> atpQuan atpCap atpRtsd

[3:10:48] <%TheBensonator_> You're being accused of selling out and it's stupid
[3:10:49] <TheA1ternative> thats gatekeeping

[3:10:54] <%DappercatEsquire> they got an image of you and get mad when you step out of it

[3:10:55] <+JustToWatch> Terminal Contrarianism?
[3:10:55] <+Fnir> shaming ?
[3:10:56] <+glgzephyr> it's a worse form of hipsterism
[3:10:56] <%Garthunox> Nah thats gatekeeping
[3:10:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's contrarianism
[3:10:58] <Neri011> An attempt at shaming?

[3:11:02] <%Ranryu692> I don't care if you have fun playing Fortnite, it just sucks to hear about that game lol
[3:11:03] <%heartlesshealer> it's still gatekeeping

[3:11:35] <jorniev> ITS TRUE I HAVE SEEN HIM
[3:11:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat has stated before how much he would love to sell out for the RAID money
[3:11:39] <balthazar758> lol yeah. pat's fortnite video got 50 dislikes on youtube. people get salty over this.
[3:11:40] <Maverick2736> TvTropes calls them, appropiately, "Stop-Having-Fun Guys", which is not the easiest thing to call them by
[3:11:41] <Clowns> Steam/Epic wars?
[3:11:43] <%bassoontyphoon> whyyyy
[3:11:43] <Zeikier> "Only Play The Right Games, Pat"
[3:11:43] <@SoFarFetched> Guys it could be worse,he could be playing and throwing his money into Gacha games.
[3:11:44] <Vermillion129> LUL LUL LUL
[3:11:45] <Madovir> the most disappointing thing about you getting into fortnite is that I don't get to hear you dump ass on popular thing I don't care about but if you're having fun I'm happy you've got a new thing, and your endless shilling is always fun
[3:11:46] <+CapnClassix> I've been watching Pat since the Man vs Wild video and fuck you @oddeye

[3:12:01] <Visorak6> Not SOUND LIKE, ARE
[3:12:02] <Zeikier> The Decline Of Games Is When They Are Popular
[3:12:02] <%AzureGale> Did you know Woolie likes HALO now
[3:12:04] <plockrock> Wait, Woolie's into Backgammon? Let's go KICK HIS ASS
[3:12:05] <Siconia> I have met so many people who are like "I don't like popular thing! That makes me interesting right?"
[3:12:07] <jorniev> hell yeah

[3:12:08] <Noogiez> maybe they're just being sarcastic?
[3:12:09] <HeroToxiko> Being parasocial is what it's called
[3:12:09] <Smokin_Fish> backgammon does suck tho
[3:12:10] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:12:10] <T_Sasquatch> Yes , thats the point LUL
[3:12:10] <Madovir> your backgammon example is fucking hilarious every time
[3:12:12] <@SoFarFetched> We should only confront Pat in his game choices if he does the Fate Gacha Kappa
[3:12:13] <samcast1> it is though
[3:12:14] <fidget_exclamation_mark> backgammon doesn't sell lawsuit merch

[3:12:26] <gollygee> Always back down, always sell out, never not sell out
[3:12:27] <Tracazoid> Woolie trying all the popular games he missed out on
[3:12:29] <%GarbageNirvana> I remember enjoying backgammon
[3:12:30] <Vermillion129> Woolie is into bible now
[3:12:30] <$RealThiele> john madden
[3:12:31] <%darklordfodder> No no, you see Halo is retro now
[3:12:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> nah man
[3:12:35] <$0ddeye> You are refreshing for playing games that aren't what the typical kids today are playing. Us guys who like you for being into fromsoft and 13 sentinels and that type of vibe, Fortnite is just everywhere else.
[3:12:35] <Siconia> No it's okay cause it'sHALO
[3:12:36] <%kylejefferies> Woolie blasted through Halo.
[3:12:36] <%W1nterTitan> HE PLAY COD infinite warfare!!
[3:12:38] <$RealThiele> embrace normie
[3:12:38] <SaltyAzteca> people can have differing opinions
[3:12:39] <%Alazull> HALO is the vanilla sex of video games
[3:12:40] <WackyModder84> No? CALL OF DUTY is the most normie shit there ever was. lol
[3:12:41] <%Dementedpenguin> I need Woolie to experience Halo 5. I'm waiting for it.
[3:12:41] <+darklordfodder> Kappa
[3:12:41] <plockrock> We've hard-pivoted from "Is Pat a Sellout" to "Woolie is a Sellout"
[3:12:42] <Siconia> Fortnite is baby game
[3:12:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> halo is big nerd shit
[3:12:43] <iosephe> CoD MW might have it beat
[3:12:44] <aPictureInMotion> stop liking the thing I don't like. also stop not liking the thing I like.
[3:12:44] <jorniev> he played COD
[3:12:45] <%bassoontyphoon> Halo is vintage now
[3:12:45] <+mechslayer71> Did a new update drop? Or is he just playing Gungeon to play it?
[3:12:46] <SaltyAzteca> And Pat can like the Fort Knights
[3:12:46] <+Dova573> Nah thats Cod
[3:12:47] <%Ranryu692> maybe the issue isn't that Fortnite is "normie" then?
[3:12:50] <+glgzephyr> @darklordfodder Oh don't do that, that's too depressing
[3:12:53] <Madovir> I can't believe they casualized backgammon 2 I'm so fucking done with games
[3:12:55] <SaltyAzteca> Its fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[3:12:55] <altruistichat> i caught woolie watching bible black
[3:12:58] <HeroToxiko> Bible Game woolieMIRIN
[3:13:01] <+polothegreatest> PROTOCOLE COLEE
[3:13:02] <%AzureGale> I remember when Halo was the scapegoat of the gaming community
[3:13:02] <%YakumoYomi> When are you gonna start doing Fate gacha streams, Pat?
[3:13:03] <%Garthunox> Ugh, Pat, cant believe you like Yakuza, trend chasing much?
[3:13:09] <%TheBensonator_> Play what you like and fuck the haters, you'll never please everyone, or some stereotypical shit like that
[3:13:12] <jorniev> THATS STUPID
[3:13:13] <Madovir> EA buying the franchise ruined backgammon 3
[3:13:14] <Zeikier> "I never liked Pat anyway and he has now justified me"
[3:13:18] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe people just like hatin you ?
[3:13:19] <%SirGO0SE> its the resentment
[3:13:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably doesn't help that Fortnite's attached to Epic
[3:13:27] <+glgzephyr> it will consume us all
[3:13:31] <Tracazoid> Just like Halo back in the day, inescapable
[3:13:32] <+CapnClassix> They like you for your more underground tastes
[3:13:32] <plockrock> You should CLEARLY be a Realm Royale streamer Pat, what's wrong with you
[3:13:34] <Frog_of_Justic> Halo is retro now its fine Kappa
[3:13:34] <Djinnazz> that's the definition of normie
[3:13:34] <+AtlasMcCoy> I dont like fortnite so I just dont watch fortnite content. Seems easy enough to me.
[3:13:35] <+Lutherian90> I think people are "disappointed" because Fortnite does a lot of the stuff you shit talked in the past, like FOMO
[3:13:36] <Smokin_Fish> its super escapable
[3:13:37] <T_Sasquatch> its pretty escapable LUL
[3:13:38] <%Broand> Kenshi is a single example of an entire of genre of games that pat'd hate.
[3:13:39] <+Seitine> He’s streamed it like once and ya’ll just shitting yourselves profusely. LUL
[3:13:40] <jorniev> @Zeikier i think thats actually it most of the time
[3:13:41] <%Ranryu692> Like, I personally hate Fortnite because it's ugly and is dragging the industry in a direction I don't like
[3:13:43] <%heartlesshealer> I honestly just can't into building on the fly
[3:13:46] <$RealThiele> now does it deserve to be the #1 game is another question but if you enjoy it play it
[3:13:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> i prefered the survival mode
[3:13:48] <gollygee> LUL 'resist' it like it's a drug or something
[3:13:49] <altruistichat> i heard pat likes chocolate
[3:13:49] <%AzureGale> It's more like a revelation
[3:13:52] <%Garthunox> Pat, this reminds me of people thinking you'd hate the FF7R stuff
[3:13:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> STOP HAVING FUN
[3:13:58] <BigManLugan> How dare Pat try to do the thing that gets him money for his HOUSE and DOG and CAR
[3:13:59] <Siconia> Game good, Epic bad
[3:14:01] <T_Sasquatch> The only reason i see fortnite is when epic shoves ads on my timeline
[3:14:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> @patstaresat ever watch akagi? it's this incredible mahjong anime where everyone is drawn like a weird triangular duck for some reason. also, entire plot is yakuza crime shit
[3:14:02] <+skylerpilot> Its because Nyanners couldn't stop singing that kids song huh
[3:14:03] <%CalderGaming> oh that's what that was
[3:14:08] <%kylejefferies> I do have genuine issues about some of the business and dev practices of Fortnite, and the building stuff isn't for me, but I am not gonna call people idiots for liking them.
[3:14:09] <HeroToxiko> oof
[3:14:10] <$StrawberryPantsu> OH
[3:14:10] <hairtoday> NICE
[3:14:10] <%Broand> oh that was GoG huh
[3:14:10] <%JoshManVGH> Woah really?
[3:14:12] <%Aeoneth> oh THAT's what that was about
[3:14:13] <%bassoontyphoon> wooopsie dooopsie
[3:14:13] <Mattais88> Or sony with the Last of Us 2 stuff
[3:14:15] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[3:14:15] <+Badlands921> fortnite is great, people are just salty
[3:14:17] <$StrawberryPantsu> That's what it was
[3:14:17] <penitentpendant> I'm try and push "Moatbuilding" from now on: Hating something from the outside without ever playing it and trying to prevent people from playing it.
[3:14:19] <$RealThiele> cybershambles
[3:14:20] <fidget_exclamation_mark> you are enjoying yourself and promoting it, specifically promoting the microtransaction part of it
[3:14:20] <%YakumoYomi> Ah, so it was GoG
[3:14:20] <+max_radical> that stings
[3:14:21] <%g4mejoy> They like you for the more obscure stuff you play, but it shouldn't mean they get pissy when you don't play those constantly.
[3:14:21] <+Jiggisnipe> people love circlejerking hate of popular things
[3:14:26] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah I guess some of you weren't here for that story
[3:14:26] <hairtoday> are you allowed to tell us that now?
[3:14:27] <%justcallmebobplease> IT WAS GOG!?
[3:14:28] <Siconia> Y'all didn't listen to the Podcast huh?
[3:14:28] <+Dova573> Maybe they are afraid you become Ninja Kappa
[3:14:29] <+CapnClassix> Wait Gog CEO is a shitbag?
[3:14:32] <%darklordfodder> Pat, sell out harder
[3:14:35] <jorniev> GOG!?
[3:14:36] <Madovir> damn dude
[3:14:36] <+Jiggisnipe> wow it was GoG huh
[3:14:37] <%blastyoboots> It also doesn't help that it's impossible not to conflate those who are hating on Fortnite for memes versus those hating Fortnite genuinely and being asses about it
[3:14:39] <+glgzephyr> man I love it when Pat dunks on One Guy who SUPER deserves it
[3:14:40] <HeroToxiko> ding dong their ceo is wrong LUL
[3:14:40] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt that sounds like anti-selling out.
[3:14:44] <%bassoontyphoon> coronary artery diesease?
[3:14:45] <$RealThiele> GOG is CDPR
[3:14:47] <Djinnazz> This stream brought to you by RAID: Shadow Legions!
[3:14:50] <Siconia> He deserves it
[3:14:52] <%blastyoboots> Wait did you get banned from GOG!??!?
[3:14:56] <%JoshManVGH> What to go out though on that though.
[3:14:58] <jorniev> OOF
[3:15:04] <Siconia> It was a problem
[3:15:04] <+SenorCounter> was wondering where story went.
[3:15:15] <%heartlesshealer> the messenger was nice. The boss was a shitlord
[3:15:17] <+CapnClassix> It's not selling out if you ALSO shit on them
[3:15:19] <Siconia> That's a real good Community Manager right there
[3:15:20] <Vermillion129> wait that thing is for CDPR!? LUL
[3:15:31] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like CDPR is a prime example of how wealth changes people
[3:15:34] <jorniev> sony?
[3:15:38] <%kylejefferies> The Steam one
[3:15:40] <+glgzephyr> what.

[3:17:06] <plockrock> Does every story you have, Pat, morph into a "Look at what WOOLIE did" story?
[3:17:10] <%JoshManVGH> Blank check. but who could have foreseen game streaming.
[3:17:17] <@SoFarFetched> you can just simply not watch the stream and do something else geefShrug

[3:17:30] <T_Sasquatch> HOW DARE YOU ENJOY WHAT I DONT LIKE
[3:17:30] <Zeikier> who now?
[3:17:31] <Smokin_Fish> I wont criticize, but I will judge
[3:17:33] <Mcmuffin______> i got into fortnite recently, its fun
[3:17:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Real talk, watching Pat play Fortnite made me want to touch Fortnite and that's never happened before
[3:17:39] <%heartlesshealer> Pat can enjoy Fortnite without giving Epic money
[3:17:44] <+mechslayer71> Longboards tho
[3:17:49] <%bassoontyphoon> god forbid
[3:17:51] <Zeikier> is she the one who's really good at obliterating jerks in her chat?
[3:17:55] <+glgzephyr> it sure is!
[3:17:58] <+CapnClassix> Some would say TOO much KH
[3:18:04] <%Garthunox> must've been bbs, and yeah, cant blame her, you need to play that game alone 3 times!
[3:18:06] <HeroToxiko> That ship mission is ass
[3:18:08] <Mattais88> KH1 is pretty rough sometimes too
[3:18:08] <Siconia> Bunch of losers can't accept when people have better things to do
[3:18:08] <%heartlesshealer> that's like 11 kingdom hearts
[3:18:09] <%cvp5127> gawrsh
[3:18:16] <%heartlesshealer> AND THE MOBILE STORY IS TRANSLATED
[3:18:22] <SaltyAzteca> OTGs
[3:18:22] <%Garthunox> FUCK THAT
[3:18:23] <+AtlasMcCoy> Hot
[3:18:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> 2 minutes is already too much Kingdom Hearts for any sane individual.
[3:18:25] <+glgzephyr> accurate
[3:18:27] <$RealThiele> gummy ships are the worst
[3:18:27] <jorniev> ooooh
[3:18:27] <Zeikier> Crit mode in 3 sucked but Easy mode with PRO codes is dope as shit
[3:18:29] <%Garthunox> FUCK MYSTERIOUS FIGURE
[3:18:31] <%crimsonharvest> Kingdom Hearts: Trainrunner
[3:18:32] <jorniev> fuck
[3:18:32] <%bassoontyphoon> hot
[3:18:33] <%JoshManVGH> It's like a 30 hour game for each game on normal. that's months of added key swinging.
[3:18:34] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[3:18:42] <balthazar758> not even tuesday
[3:18:42] <+Birdigalore> No Heart and Young Xehanort are busted ass shiot in BBS
[3:18:43] <+glgzephyr> TLDR LUL
[3:18:43] <%GarbageNirvana> This was the era of Square Enix making shit like FFXII's three-hour-long secret boss, so
[3:18:44] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt the thing you said about isaac it literally has the ability to check items and what they do
[3:18:46] <%Sanyle> They turn invisible too
[3:18:47] <%Garthunox> Fortnite is fun!
[3:18:59] <+CapnClassix> I prefer Warzone but play what you like
[3:19:14] <Siconia> It's fine, all the people who like Kenshi are gone LUL
[3:19:14] <Zeikier> what got you into trying Kenshi again?
[3:19:20] <iosephe> The game just presents itself really poorly
[3:19:21] <Frog_of_Justic> The Sephiropth fights is KH1&2 are bullshit on max difficulty without going high level
[3:19:33] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd like Warzone better if you couldn't get sniped by someone in an entirely different section of the map
[3:19:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Pat is bummed he can't get into Kenshi
[3:19:36] <AtticusofBronne> Hoi chat and tiny pat 👀
[3:19:45] <herotony04> Will you be playing fortnite. I dont enjoy the game but i do enjoy watching you play.
[3:19:45] <+glgzephyr> sometimes trash is just trash
[3:19:50] <Zeikier> Wirst Impression
[3:19:51] <%Broand> Hey did you watch the dwarf fortress or Cataclysm reviews
[3:19:53] <jorniev> ONE GUY MADE IT, thats why its so ass
[3:19:58] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean I grew out of liking Dead by Daylight, but good for everyone else for liking the game.
[3:20:01] <+Jiggisnipe> sometimes things are niche for a reason
[3:20:03] <plockrock> Sad thing about Kenshi is that you need to be coached going in how to get started
[3:20:06] <%darklordfodder> Most of my friends felt the same about Factorio :(
[3:20:06] <%Kay_Tana> I actually bought a founders pack for Fortnite on PS4, but once the battle royal came out and became the focus I had to drop it.
[3:20:10] <+glgzephyr> dude stop trying to make ONE GUY MADE IT an excuse.
[3:20:12] <Frostydough1> Cyberpunk??
[3:20:16] <Siconia> Dude he's not gonna like Cataclysm, get the fuck out
[3:20:17] <+RushUnplugged> it's a game for people that really enjoy getting kicked into a sandbox with no direction
[3:20:25] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah.... that was weird.
[3:20:26] <TheA1ternative> Why would they care? wtf
[3:20:28] <penitentpendant> Sigh
[3:20:28] <$SGrim> Oh yeah, that shit.
[3:20:29] <Siconia> Who?
[3:20:29] <A0N33> Oh those guys can fuck right off
[3:20:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> @jorniev Man, just give it a rest, bro
[3:20:38] <+Jiggisnipe> BUT THE VIEWERSHIP
[3:20:39] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:20:40] <TheAntiNihilist> can't wait for vod
[3:20:41] <Siconia> Woman cannot stream when man stream
[3:20:44] <$RealThiele> one marriage counselor guy
[3:20:44] <+glgzephyr> The reason the game is bad is because the ONE GUY who made it is bad at making video games. Maybe he's good at worldbuilding.
[3:20:44] <%heartlesshealer> That was half the point of the Office?????????
[3:20:46] <@SoFarFetched> "no you should ONLY be with pat on his stream and stream ONLY when he's not streaming"
[3:20:46] <Tracazoid> Yeah it's weird, I just opened you both up in separate tabs
[3:20:47] <%SirGO0SE> scandalous D:
[3:20:50] <Siconia> Woman steal man viewers
[3:20:50] <+CapnClassix> HOW DARE YOU
[3:20:50] <%cvp5127> synergy
[3:20:58] <%Arweynn> but how can she BETRAY you like that?
[3:21:01] <%Aeoneth> I think it's more we want to watch both of you and making us have to choose causes... issues... in some people
[3:21:01] <+AtlasMcCoy> What if they were just worried that paige would somehow break all her bones without you around?
[3:21:02] <jorniev> @rumtumtugnutz no
[3:21:03] <%JoshManVGH> More money for Geif shirts!
[3:21:05] <penitentpendant> Honestly, that you can both stream w/o drop in quality in either stream was impressive
[3:21:06] <%heartlesshealer> They kept having to dance around each other's times before! Let them stream simultaneously!
[3:21:07] <Astrophizz> they share income lol
[3:21:09] <+CapnClassix> She's cheating on us for another chat!!
[3:21:09] <+Dova573> Fiances COMUNICATING?!
[3:21:10] <YakumoYomi> But she's stealing your views, Pat!
[3:21:10] <+glgzephyr> But it's not because it's just one guy. It's that he's bad at making games.
[3:21:11] <TheAntiNihilist> Paige: cuz fuck him
[3:21:12] <AtticusofBronne> It’s against the rules of Streaming clearly @patstaresat
[3:21:13] <+Dova573> What a concept
[3:21:13] <Frostydough1> Yeah it was really weirdchamp of them for trying to make it like... a betrayal??
[3:21:30] <acexclover> its a bit weird it sucks to split viewers but it doesnt make sense to say something aeroShrug
[3:21:31] <@SoFarFetched> I mean thats just watching streams in general,gotta choose who you wanna watch and when.
[3:21:32] <s1rcuit> people are gonna shit there pants at the first opportunity, ignore them
[3:21:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> SNORE
[3:21:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> i like how it implies she's gottento the point where paige doesn't need pat for tech support any more
[3:21:51] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt hey, would "Tribe's Police" fit that weird person who keeps tabs on your likes and dislikes based on tribalist notions
[3:21:51] <Mcmuffin______> when is fortnite
[3:21:52] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes your favorite streamers are streaming at the same time geefShrug
[3:22:02] <+Dova573> Oh man the harem substory in Like a dragon is the best
[3:22:06] <+AtlasMcCoy> The disco zone

[3:25:32] <TheAntiNihilist> play Cyberpunk
[3:25:34] <%AzureGale> You can't have sex with a Steam Press Account tho
[3:25:37] <+glgzephyr> YES
[3:25:38] <%LordSDB> Yes Kenshi is niche
[3:25:39] <%TheA1ternative> indie game
[3:25:40] <@SoFarFetched> I'd say yeah
[3:25:41] <A0N33> Kenchi's SUPER niche.
[3:25:43] <jorniev> really!?
[3:25:44] <%Ranryu692> I'd never heard of it before last week
[3:25:44] <ullyzeez> how about that new game with hades gameplay and darkest dungeon aethestic?
[3:25:47] <%bassoontyphoon> yyyyeeep
[3:25:48] <%JoshManVGH> Very, yeah
[3:25:49] <%heartlesshealer> yeah it's niche
[3:25:49] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[3:25:51] <%DappercatEsquire> gate's already kept, my dudes
[3:25:52] <Vermillion129> Oh Griftlands is in early access, that's why I havent heard about it
[3:25:55] <+glgzephyr> no one is trying to get in
[3:25:57] <jorniev> duper cult
[3:25:59] <%TheA1ternative> WOWEE WHO WOULDA THUNK IT
[3:26:00] <%Garthunox> Gate keeping is so fucking weird, cos, like, why wouldnt you want to get more people into something?
[3:26:02] <ullyzeez> forgot what its called
[3:26:03] <%bassoontyphoon> It'll do that on its own
[3:26:03] <%heartlesshealer> it's a very specific flavor of jank
[3:26:03] <rosysyntax> @ullyzeez whaaat?
[3:26:05] <$StrawberryPantsu> Kenshi gatekeeps it's self
[3:26:09] <%JoshManVGH> It's kept It's own gate
[3:26:09] <+Lutherian90> Those people aren't gatekeeping you, they WANT you to play it
[3:26:10] <%Ranryu692> its obscurity is the biggest gate there is
[3:26:14] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:26:16] <$RealThiele> gate needs to be wide fuckin open
[3:26:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AzureGale become the ghost in the machine first
[3:26:18] <T_Sasquatch> If i cant make other people feel bad why should i even exist
[3:26:22] <HeroToxiko> the gate is welded shut by design LUL
[3:26:30] <jorniev> its a really weird stance to take
[3:26:31] <+glgzephyr> The Steam page sent me running
[3:26:33] <$mellorolo> yo hoodies are something i should have known should have been your thing!
[3:26:36] <Vermillion129> Kenshi is honestly very hard to get into. I try many times to get in but I have no clue what I'm even doing
[3:26:39] <ullyzeez> @rosysyntax its curse of the dead gods i looked it up
[3:26:57] <%asgard147> But how will people feel better about their "Superior" ability to play the game Pat?
[3:27:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt who you maining for Outriders?
[3:27:03] <$RealThiele> i just had 2 tabs open LUL
[3:27:07] <%PatVA_> PatVA_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat,  enjoying the streams. Sorry if you talked about it already, but regarding Isaac. Is your only problem that it doesn't have a bestiary like Gungeon?
[3:27:12] <jorniev> outriders would be fun to watch
[3:27:15] <Djinnazz> Like Ninja Gaiden.
[3:27:21] <illTemperedSeaBass> @PatStaresAt I don't think they were trying to gatekeep you out of the game. I think it was the opposite: they were so rabidly trying to get you into the game that they set off every single red flag.
[3:27:22] <%heartlesshealer> it's not great for RPGs
[3:27:23] <rosysyntax> @ullyzeez Oh yeah, I saw some footage of that. Looks kinda neat? I like the lantern mechanic.
[3:27:27] <@SoFarFetched> I didnt see the true ending for EDF5 cause you needed to be on a higher difficulty for it.
[3:27:35] <Zeikier> I like true endings for like, beating hidden bosses n stuff
[3:27:37] <%Garthunox> KH always has em behind both, but the higher the difficulty the less strict the requirements
[3:27:38] <bob900000> it sucks for rpgs
[3:27:38] <jorniev> DMC 5 Beating URIZEN early
[3:27:45] <%Garthunox> oh wow
[3:27:48] <%bassoontyphoon> what about endings tied to performing a bizarre specific set of criteria
[3:27:54] <%heartlesshealer> For RPGs it's better to use events as opposed to collectibles
[3:28:01] <+JaseAdrift> Critical mode you mean
[3:28:01] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Remember Farcry 4's secret ending?
[3:28:06] <%Garthunox> Oh man Pat, Critical is even worse
[3:28:12] <+glgzephyr> I just watched the secret ending on Youtube. Not worth it to me
[3:28:14] <$RealThiele> FISHY FUN
[3:28:19] <%Garthunox> Critical for KH2 halves your total health value
[3:28:30] <bob900000> critical makes proud a joke
[3:28:34] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[3:28:36] <Bl4ckK4ngaroo> @PatStaresAt Why not play Exit the Gungeon?
[3:28:38] <penitentpendant> Don't do it in person?
[3:28:39] <%AzureGale> F
[3:28:40] <ullyzeez> bruh proud mode is the actual fun mode for adults
[3:28:41] <+glgzephyr> I get why people like Critical Mode in KH2, but I'm just too casual for it
[3:28:47] <$RealThiele> (X)
[3:28:48] <%TheA1ternative> oh no
[3:28:50] <Zeikier> break up via text 4Head
[3:28:51] <$mellorolo> what do i get if i beat KH on lvl 1
[3:28:54] <+Stormzcales_Lair> just do it. if they arent savy enough to work in a shop. pffft.
[3:28:55] <%TheA1ternative> ok saved
[3:28:57] <%heartlesshealer> Tell your dealer where to apply for work
[3:29:00] <%SirGO0SE> message him saying "hey im going to the weed store, need anything?"
[3:29:03] <%LordSDB> NP, also oh man hearing my name had me at panic of "WAIT WHA WHAT I DO?? " NotLikeThis
[3:29:04] <%TheA1ternative> had me at that first half
[3:29:05] <ullyzeez> lmao as if pat ever had a dealer
[3:29:10] <%asgard147> But what if he calls?
[3:29:14] <+JaseAdrift> @mellorolo NOTHING LUL
[3:29:21] <%Sanyle> 300 hours of your time to watch a couple knights slapbox
[3:29:23] <+glgzephyr> block the number?
[3:29:27] <TheAntiNihilist> plot twist
[3:29:39] <TheAntiNihilist> plot twist. his dealing is his WIFE
[3:29:41] <+glgzephyr> you mean eight way?
[3:29:45] <leinadtonu> Pat's dealer is the Canadian government...
[3:29:47] <%darklordfodder> 8 way
[3:29:49] <rosemon5001> it literally has the ability to check what the item does
[3:29:49] <+RushUnplugged> Isaac is a game you either got into 15 years ago, or it's completely unapproachable
[3:29:50] <%Broand> 4 way shootin
[3:29:52] <%heartlesshealer> four way aiming
[3:29:52] <%darklordfodder> Ah
[3:29:55] <rosysyntax> it feels bad to play for me :(
[3:29:56] <%PatVA_> ah gotcha
[3:29:58] <Zebroneath> Stiff and somehow floaty
[3:30:04] <T_Sasquatch> that sounds awful
