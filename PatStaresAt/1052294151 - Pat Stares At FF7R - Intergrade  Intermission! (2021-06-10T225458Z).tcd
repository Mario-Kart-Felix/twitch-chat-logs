[0:05:23] <DemonioB> is this about elden ring?
[0:05:35] <%condemned_15> did i miss anything?
[0:05:55] <%chance_h> Everything is about Elden Ring now
[0:06:01] <%heartlesshealer> just barely went live, you haven't missed anything since the earlier trailer stuff
[0:06:15] <+Vigonept> Elden ring news after 50 years bois
[0:06:29] <%shieldecho> It's been 84 years memeTM
[0:06:38] <+CelioHogane> Elden ring news just mean one thing
[0:06:38] <%dooscent> dooscent subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I don't have a PS5, so time to experience Intergrade vicariously!
[0:06:39] <%Robot_Nixon_> Rip elden ring subreddit lore
[0:06:40] <%chance_h> I just want to see more 2bean memes
[0:06:40] <tanarath> looks character action w/ some open world
[0:06:42] <%maenos2> I seriously thought Geoff was gonna do something else
[0:06:46] <+CelioHogane> Still no bayonetta 3 news Kappa
[0:06:55] <%cvp5127> bayo sub on suicide watch
[0:07:03] <%heartlesshealer> isn't nintendo's thing later?
[0:07:09] <coffeewithmcauley> GlitchCat
[0:07:10] <%shieldecho> What was announced first, Elden Ring or Bayo 3
[0:07:11] <%heartlesshealer> I mean, still no confidence, but yeah
[0:07:17] <+CelioHogane> @heartlesshealer the 15th, yes
[0:07:19] <DemonioB> Nintendo may be about metroid, no bayo
[0:07:21] <KenReels> yeah Tuesday
[0:07:23] <%Robot_Nixon_> The elden ring subreddit lore was the best thing to check back in on
[0:07:27] <s1rcuit> is the music faster?
[0:07:30] <%heartlesshealer> thank you guys
[0:07:30] <+CelioHogane> @shieldecho Bayonetta 3, definetly.
[0:07:32] <majindusto> Did pat delete his stream of the game announcements?
[0:07:39] <%shieldecho> Daaaaamn
[0:07:50] <%Ipsenscastle> FF7R lackt Gackt after he got sackt, but now he's backt, true fackts  - There, I think that's the most rhymes I can fit into a sentence
[0:07:52] <%watts121> Pat missed Geoff getting outta jail.

[0:09:23] <%dooscent> I played through Dirge of Cerberus a week before Intergrade was announced. Weiss appearing was probably my fault.
[0:09:27] <%maenos2> @ipsenscastle you lackt hackt, and that's whackt.
[0:09:29] <+CelioHogane> I wonder how many of "Dirge of cerverus spoilers" will see
[0:09:37] <majindusto> I will unironically  Mark Out if/when Genesis  Returns
[0:09:40] <%nevan_44> psaBig psaDogchamp
[0:09:47] <+WiredBall> is pat gonna play the director's cut of death stranding?
[0:09:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @maenos2 haha I tried desperately to fit hackt in there, but whackt genuinely didn't occur to me
[0:10:32] <%greencapps> HYPE
[0:10:40] <%maskedsongbird> @Ipsenscastle Yo I like your username.
[0:10:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh I missed the vod of the summer games stream will there by any clips posted? :(
[0:10:47] <%maenos2> @ipsenscastle all good, I was kinda doing a homer version of "art, cart, dart, e-art" but eith gackt myself
[0:11:01] <%Ipsenscastle> @maskedsongbird thank you very much! :)
[0:11:08] <%Lizard0TM> Lizard0TM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Okay but when's FF7R on pc...
[0:11:26] <%greencapps> The original FF7R streams were some of my favorites
[0:11:31] <SomeAsianDood> ooooooooooo ELDEN RING
[0:11:35] <%greencapps> Very excited for more
[0:11:36] <godzookylives> FF7 Remake Part 2 will have Cloud and Sephiroth teaming up to defeat Gackt
[0:11:38] <%Ipsenscastle> @maenos2 that's how pro poets do it
[0:12:03] <majindusto> EVEN IF THE MORROW  IS BAREN OF PROMISES...NOTHING  SHALL  FORESTALL HIS RETURN!
[0:12:09] <pipboy344> @MrBorisMakarov it was a DMCA panicky shitshow like Game Awars
[0:12:10] <%maskedsongbird> I'm still salty about Intergrade and Intermission both being exclusive to a console that's damn near impossible to get...
[0:12:13] <%jackythefrost> Still find it hilarious how FF7R is actually a direct sequel to the entire FF7 Extended universe
[0:12:14] <pipboy344> Game Awards
[0:12:15] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! i have become whole. my ascension is complete, and for that i thank you. also will the vod for the summer fest get uploaded to youtube or did you delete it like the last time this shit happened
[0:12:29] <+mechslayer71> Any reason why the vod for the summer games show isn’t available? DMCA?
[0:12:32] <CheesesSliced> Considering were moving onto the sixteenth entry in the franchise, maybe they should just call it Fantasy
[0:12:38] <%superc37> wouldve been nice if it was an actual remake
[0:12:38] <%KineticZen> Dink Donk by Dink3rs feat. Donked Dinktor sure is a jam
[0:12:43] <%KishinGrek> 2nd stream
[0:12:47] <%maenos2> so how about that weezer
[0:13:04] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab
[0:13:08] <%jackythefrost> @maskedsongbird Well Intergrade itself is just an ehanced port. Intermission is the big thing
[0:13:11] <+Ches_Neckbeard> play wonderwall!
[0:13:12] <%KineticZen> Why boats though.
[0:13:13] <pipboy344> @mechslayer71 They panic about DMCA even though Geoff repeatedly said it was free use
[0:13:16] <%KishinGrek> so how is everyone after elden ring was revealed to be real and not a mass fever dream?
[0:13:34] <%maskedsongbird> @maskedsongbird Still, though...
[0:13:40] <%superc37> im guessing paige was the one who panicked hard
[0:13:41] <pipboy344> @mechslayer71 Was a shitshow like Game Awards
[0:13:55] <+mechslayer71> @kishingrek I mean, we got the leaks earlier this year, we knew it was real
[0:13:59] <majindusto> Please  tell me Pat saced the VOD for YouTube  upload...I NEED TO SEE HIS REACTION  TO ELDIN RING
[0:14:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> @KishinGrek waiting for SMTV to become real as well, after that I'm set
[0:14:05] <pipboy344> @superc37 Just like Game Awards
[0:14:10] <%maenos2> I assume they'll be panicky for the other conferences too
[0:14:13] <CheesesSliced> If Pat were typecast for a movie, what role would be fill? I personally would love to see Pimp Pat
[0:14:14] <majindusto> *saved the VOD
[0:14:25] <%MrBorisMakarov> I sincerely hope he at least grabbed the elden ring reveal
[0:14:28] <CheesesSliced> *he
[0:14:30] <%superc37> they could just edit the vod afterwards to remove the music, but i guess thatd be too much work
[0:14:33] <%KishinGrek> @sapphire_breeze that one is real, were waiting for a release
[0:14:51] <%Ipsenscastle> I hope the open world adds something fresh to Elden Ring because the aesthetic skewed so close to DS3 it may as well be another sequel otherwise. The snippets of bosses looked awesome though
[0:14:56] <%MonsterEnvy> MonsterEnvy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Hey Pat I can't believe I have been subbed for so long. Enjoy the Final Fantasy.
[0:14:58] <pipboy344> @maenos2 Square is doing two streams, one with licensed music one with free use
[0:14:58] <%valriot> Eldenborne Soulkiro 4
[0:15:07] <majindusto> Pat is notorious  for Hating  Work
[0:15:19] <pipboy344> @maenos2 Supposed to be two concurrent feeds
[0:15:20] <vandastelka> where is the vod for the event anyone know? i missed the stream.
[0:15:21] <%jackythefrost> @majindusto I'll tell ya this now, the excitement was kinda dulled cause of how awful the whole show itself was
[0:15:22] <%maenos2> @pipboy344 that's good at least
[0:15:38] <pipboy344> @vandastelka Nuked over DMCA fears
[0:15:41] <+Chex868> were the vod u coward
[0:15:51] <iosephe> YEYEYE
[0:15:51] <%AzureGale> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:15:54] <vandastelka> @pipboy344 ok thanks
[0:15:55] <+flexin_apex> Oh elden ring u became a real boy
[0:16:06] <%heartlesshealer> the vod burned to avoid DMCA
[0:16:08] <%Ipsenscastle> I'll take Metal Slug Tactics and that Limbo-like, it wasn't a complete wash out at least
[0:16:11] <+Chex868> were the reaction vod u cowsrd
[0:16:22] <%shieldecho> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:16:30] <%AzureGale> Sacrifice the VOD for more time on the clock
[0:16:38] <%heartlesshealer> =T
[0:16:38] <majindusto> OF COUSE IT WAS DULLED...Pat saw Sonic Music  being  played and no fun allowed

[0:21:08] <%KineticZen> Position yourself at my ass
[0:21:09] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Looks like Yuffie episode is about 4 to 7 hours depending on side content
[0:21:10] <%Ipsenscastle> It's almost as if these events literally don't understand how their own marketing works
[0:21:12] <%KishinGrek> was Geoff lying
[0:21:12] <LoneFonte> @s1rcuit video on demand
[0:21:14] <+red_cuppa> aw man

[0:21:24] <$Futurecity10> god I afucking hate Geoff
[0:21:24] <%maskofmichael> Mute Pat Let's Go!
[0:21:29] <%superc37> @PatStaresAt or just pay someone to edit the videos
[0:21:29] <NewWillinium> That would suck but we would understand completely
[0:21:29] <stantheman_97> oh boy
[0:21:32] <%Robot_Nixon_> twitch sponsored events are DMCA bait 😡
[0:21:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Geof lied, channels died
[0:21:32] <%KishinGrek> you could stream them on YouTube
[0:21:33] <+PenmanLupine> Max already does this whenever a trailer with lyrics shows up
[0:21:33] <%derpy_platypus> just dub over it
[0:21:33] <@SoFarFetched> "BUT YOURE SAFE PAT" -gets DMCA'd on youtube-
[0:21:33] <s1rcuit> thanks everyone
[0:21:33] <HaroldDonchee> that would suck
[0:21:34] <%dooscent> audiojungle, audiojungle, audiojungle
[0:21:34] <%BigCoffee> Paige can use her singing voice to make content
[0:21:36] <%Rumbutt> I mean, that could honestly make a lot of them better
[0:21:38] <majindusto> Sigh
[0:21:38] <+zzNamttamzz> But Weezer was ok SeemsGood
[0:21:40] <+Suchawus> just play the Daytona USA theme on loop
[0:21:41] <brisk_dacat> Just play your jntr music over everything
[0:21:42] <%Jungos60> Thx UMG you greedy fucks
[0:21:44] <$ringabal> Just blast Daytona over everything
[0:21:44] <%Monkeyweed21> why even bother at that point
[0:21:45] <%dankjerri> some trailers are only good because of their music, like Dante's Inferno
[0:21:46] <%superc37> oh yeah that too
[0:21:49] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt we can just open the streams for ourselves. That's fine.
[0:21:50] <+spartanghost004> yeah most likely
[0:21:51] <%ironohki> I had the actual show synced in another window for the full experience. Basically just run it like a Riff Track.
[0:21:51] <%Nekros4442> that works. we can just watch the original vid and just have ur voice in a diff tab
[0:21:52] <%derpy_platypus> send it to someone for a fandub
[0:21:52] <+athuramn> it's just not worth streaming at that point though, no?
[0:21:52] <@SoFarFetched> If pat is literally getting DMCA'd on youtube geefAwk imagine on twitch.
[0:21:54] <SunsetJack> Some streamers just turn off some sections they assume is DMCA.
[0:21:55] <vandastelka> can you edit the vod
[0:21:59] <+mechslayer71> Why even bother at that point?
[0:22:00] <%BulbasaursCry> sound off lights off
[0:22:01] <+kullumanati> Why even do them?
[0:22:02] <Tracazoid> Just MST3K over what you think the plot is
[0:22:05] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Just do that. Let us run the actual stream separately
[0:22:05] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> FUCK IT, WEVE GOT ELDEN RING
[0:22:07] <CheesesSliced> They can't strike whistling...
[0:22:08] <+athuramn> we can always hear about it on the podcast or something?
[0:22:14] <SunsetJack> Fair enough.
[0:22:15] <%watts121> Pat why play this when you could be playing the horrible Ninja Gaiden PC port?
[0:22:15] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[0:22:16] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> could just have it in another tab with audio on our end
[0:22:17] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Use headphones
[0:22:19] <+shadowsvrse> BIG SUS
[0:22:20] <%heartlesshealer> they'll get you on the video footage too, music or not =\
[0:22:21] <%KishinGrek> Thanks Lars
[0:22:22] <dan_g_v> which ones?
[0:22:23] <%ospreyworks> Jesus fucking christ twitch
[0:22:23] <CheesesSliced> YODEL THE TRACKS INSTEAD!
[0:22:23] <%Eaglestrike117> Couldnt you get a solution where you get sound through a headset but the stream doesnt hear shit?
[0:22:25] <%dooscent> UMG claims all
[0:22:25] <tanarath> CHRIST
[0:22:30] <%dankjerri> just tell riaa to get a dog up ya
[0:22:31] <%LonePlus_> dark pat
[0:22:31] <%SirGO0SE> amogus monkaS
[0:22:31] <+spartanghost004> wait so what the hell were the copyrighting?
[0:22:31] <@SoFarFetched> And we listen on our own
[0:22:33] <%BulbasaursCry> Would it just be a stream of Pat staring at nothing and silently screaming at something off screen
[0:22:34] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Maybe wear earphones and have the stream sound only go there?
[0:22:36] <%TheWinged7> @CheesesSliced they have striked running water and breathing, they can easily strike whistling
[0:22:38] <+shadowsvrse> coward
[0:22:40] <%Dementedpenguin> That's fine, actually./
[0:22:40] <%solracc25> Sus
[0:22:40] <%LonePlus_> after the battlefield ANTI-PATS get him
[0:22:41] <sendart> we can just open the window ourselves
[0:22:41] <%ssjklyco> At what point do they just start striking people just saying "hello" because it sounds like something from a random song/movie/show
[0:22:41] <oceanmatt> fair enough
[0:22:41] <dan_g_v> then we need some Pat dub works
[0:22:42] <%superc37> im fine with that
[0:22:42] <%Ipsenscastle> that seems like the best solution to this stupid problem
[0:22:42] <$StrawberryPantsu> Use headphones and sing the songs
[0:22:43] <%LonePlus_> we're too late
[0:22:43] <+Vigonept> just do a watch along
[0:22:44] <@SoFarFetched> ESPECIALLY YOU IN THE JURY geefPoint
[0:22:45] <%Ranryu692> we can have the main stream open side-by-side
[0:22:45] <%MidnightBurst12> :(
[0:22:46] <+flexin_apex> Thanks sonic
[0:22:46] <majindusto> So no VOD  on YouTube  then enigmaSad
[0:22:48] <iosephe> Thanks RIAA!
[0:22:49] <+athuramn> yeah, that's fine tbh
[0:22:49] <%heartlesshealer> headphones probably a good idea if paige isn't using them
[0:22:51] <+PenmanLupine> Don't just watch them I guess. don't give them the publicity if marketing is gonna keep fucking streamers. they know whats up already.
[0:22:52] <dan_g_v> Pat badly singing with wrong lyrics the songs
[0:22:52] <+JD0394> @patstaresat I missed your e3 stream earlier. Will you be uploading it to YT?
[0:22:52] <%tortugatime214> tortugatime214 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey Patrick, watching while I’m labbing Strive, thanks for being you!!
[0:22:53] <$ringabal> ONE MORE STREAM REJECTED
[0:22:54] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Pat Solution is use headphones, we stream on second screen
[0:22:55] <%TheLemuroid> Yeah we can sync the actual video with the VOD
[0:22:55] <scarman125> love it when twitch freezes then forces me to watch a 30 second add
[0:22:55] <%Robot_Nixon_> D:
[0:22:55] <LoneFonte> yeah, we can just play both as layers
[0:22:57] <%AbnormalVoid> have it playing in the background, then have the audience sync the stream to your stream @PatStaresAt
[0:22:58] <+Vigonept> with a timer and everything
[0:23:00] <NewWillinium> Oh yeah speaking of
[0:23:01] <lKaleidoscopel> just play by play announcements
[0:23:01] <839ricky> Can you not have an output for mic and video audio and delete one afterwards?
[0:23:02] <Sunstalker> With a dual pc, you could upload audio without it saving to the vod but fuck that effort
[0:23:06] <%dankjerri> burn down UMG
[0:23:12] <%heartlesshealer> fuck UMG always
[0:23:14] <%Dementedpenguin> I would just sync the video you're reacting to
[0:23:17] <CheesesSliced> Yodel the tracks for us, Pat
[0:23:19] <%maskofmichael> I want to see the DMCA manager

[0:23:32] <+red_cuppa> w o w
[0:23:33] <%SirGO0SE> UMG is almost making me embrace NFTs

[0:25:08] <signofzeta> that bioware quality
[0:25:09] <Basch71> no
[0:25:10] <%valriot> I swear 90% of ME3 drama, is made from One Guy complaints
[0:25:11] <pipboy344> @patstaresat ALL synthetics die
[0:25:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> He can
[0:25:11] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[0:25:11] <tranquilturnip> only if you get really REALLY high points
[0:25:11] <$Faustgesicht> Technically
[0:25:12] <Blank9> shepard is too stupid to know he's synthetic
[0:25:12] <%MidnightBurst12> ye
[0:25:12] <dashmatt> yes
[0:25:12] <%thbluewarden> kind of?
[0:25:12] <%Cykron> YES
[0:25:12] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Shepard lives with max readiness.
[0:25:12] <MonsterGills> yeah
[0:25:13] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Maybe, you see his armor
[0:25:13] <tanarath> IT'S GREAT
[0:25:13] <$SGrim> yes
[0:25:14] <tattleworm> best ems, yeah
[0:25:14] <Dabrikishaw> @tattleworm See, THAT I belive
[0:25:14] <+shapeforn> uh, he CAN
[0:25:14] <ivanmistwalker> yes
[0:25:14] <%dooscent> Shep survives with HUGE readiness
[0:25:14] <dd44dostivei> with max EMS
[0:25:15] <%maenos2> If at full
[0:25:16] <+Vigonept> robot
[0:25:17] <$SGrim> magic
[0:25:18] <PraiseHemra> kinda
[0:25:18] <+Kyma1020> it's the only one he survives in
[0:25:18] <%lucky_icarus> Fuck you, thats why
[0:25:18] <%KineticZen> He gets evaporated in Destroy though
[0:25:19] <%Monkeyweed21> maybe
[0:25:19] <$ringabal> thats correct
[0:25:19] <%Garthunox> yes
[0:25:20] <tanarath> It... depends
[0:25:20] <%valriot> No Shepard never survives
[0:25:21] <%Valdorick> Don't worry about it
[0:25:22] <%Ipsenscastle> none of it makes sense
[0:25:22] <%Cykron> If you have EMS at full
[0:25:22] <ivanmistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:25:24] <%thbluewarden> theres a wierd stinger at the end
[0:25:25] <blackjack8182> Pick destroy regardless
[0:25:27] <%Garthunox> its very possible
[0:25:27] <%Ipsenscastle> a wizard did it
[0:25:28] <iosephe> not an AI
[0:25:28] <%Jeemukun> if your EMS is max they live
[0:25:29] <Wolfstriker121> so them mass efffect 4 is continue with sheapard then huh
[0:25:29] <+spartanghost004> He somehow survives being in a crashing citadel
[0:25:29] <+flexin_apex> Clone
[0:25:29] <$Faustgesicht> Post credit scene at max preparedness
[0:25:30] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Yes Shepard lives
[0:25:30] <oceanmatt> i think theres a stinger in one of the endings
[0:25:31] <%Retinolgaming> Shep survives if max readiness
[0:25:31] <%Rumbutt> Shepard absolutely dies in destroy unless your maxed out there's a twitch
[0:25:31] <tanarath> It's incredibly unclear
[0:25:33] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You see his body at the end
[0:25:34] <blackjack8182> Yes
[0:25:34] <ape_hawk> pat, at this point, how much of ME3 has been spoiled for you?
[0:25:35] <%heartlesshealer> alive long enough to die
[0:25:35] <%baronouroboros> Shepardus Amogus
[0:25:36] <%maenos2> SHOCJER
[0:25:37] <%valriot> No people are just fucking dumb
[0:25:37] <%BigCoffee> Noooooooooo!
[0:25:37] <$ringabal> IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN
[0:25:37] <%thbluewarden> you may be right
[0:25:38] <Vaunno> dont it?
[0:25:39] <PraiseHemra> its not clear
[0:25:39] <JoshTheFace> yup
[0:25:39] <+spartanghost004> oh it was
[0:25:40] <%Ipsenscastle> yep
[0:25:40] <tattleworm> yuh huh
[0:25:40] <LoneFonte> WHAT? NO WAY
[0:25:40] <%Jeemukun> YA DON'T SAY

[0:25:41] <ivanmistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:25:42] <+stellarseeker> yes
[0:25:42] <%condemned_15> Kappa
[0:25:42] <%heartlesshealer> I WONDER WHY
[0:25:43] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt You're just gonna save before the ending choice and show them all on stream anyway to laugh at them
[0:25:44] <%bazzabarra> me3 ending apologists are insane
[0:25:46] <%watts121> No just poorly lighted.
[0:25:47] <+spartanghost004> super poorly writeen
[0:25:47] <Dragovus> Shep Breathes
[0:25:47] <blackjack8182> It’s dumb
[0:25:48] <tranquilturnip> I remember looking years ago that you can keep Shep alive if you get the highest amount of points and pick destroy
[0:25:48] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> dumb excuse I saw, Shepards robot parts aren't Reaper robot parts
[0:25:49] <tanarath> OH REALLY PAT ARE YOU SURE
[0:25:49] <dan_g_v> but Mass Effect is the pinacle of modern sci fi, Pat
[0:25:51] <+shapeforn> Hmm, i think he has a lot of regrown tissue and organs, buttt yeah should at least have a lot of complications
[0:25:51] <$Hommando> Shepard has come back to life before
[0:25:56] <dan_g_v> it can't be poorly written
[0:25:59] <blackjack8182> Yep
[0:26:03] <+Kyma1020> Rushed and poorly written
[0:26:03] <%valriot> Shes no purple?
[0:26:04] <%chance_h> Do diabetics survive?
[0:26:05] <+spartanghost004> they ruined it pat

[0:26:07] <ivanmistwalker> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:26:07] <%heartlesshealer> what
[0:26:08] <+Vigonept> WHAT
[0:26:08] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah it's better but not good
[0:26:08] <%SirGO0SE> remember when we thought Mass Effect's best feature was its story NotLikeThis
[0:26:08] <%Valdorick> She's like... Slug brown
[0:26:09] <NewWillinium> Yeah but she's not like a translucent Brown
[0:26:09] <%condemned_15> my shutterstock waifu
[0:26:10] <%BigCoffee> The game written by an asshole who was scared people found out the original ending is now badly written? Say it aint so!
[0:26:10] <dd44dostivei> she looks like mileena
[0:26:11] <+MelodyMedley> I wonder why
[0:26:11] <NewWillinium> Now
[0:26:12] <+Vigonept> LAME
[0:26:13] <%valriot> Theyre grey
[0:26:14] <%heartlesshealer> why no purple?!
[0:26:16] <tolloponik> wha Thats So STUPID
[0:26:18] <%MidnightBurst12> nooooooo

[0:26:22] <majindusto> THE HAND LOOKS AWFUL
[0:26:23] <Zeif00> No Plussy FeelsBadMan
[0:26:24] <NewWillinium> Transluscent Brown.
[0:26:25] <%watts121> she's basically human with silver eyes and forehead marks.
[0:26:28] <%Mr_Pylon> that's dumb
[0:26:28] <ivanmistwalker> LAAAAAAMMMMEEEEE
[0:26:28] <scarman125> wait why? that's dumb
[0:26:28] <%BulbasaursCry> wellfuck
[0:26:29] <%heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis
[0:26:33] <CheesesSliced> Yeah, play Andromeda instead
[0:26:33] <+MelodyMedley> She's not purple?!

[0:26:39] <%Monkeyweed21> IT WAS WAY WORSE BEFORE
[0:26:39] <dd44dostivei> it's literally her model with no visor

[0:26:41] <%Jeemukun> don't forget the weird legs
[0:26:42] <dan_g_v> boring, not butt friends any more
[0:26:42] <+yoshkosh20> BRING BACK MY PURPLE WAIFU
[0:26:45] <ape_hawk> @BigCoffee there was no original ending. they were winging the entire thing.
[0:26:47] <MonsterGills> like the asari
[0:26:47] <+TopTieramisu> tali no longer a mad titan
[0:26:52] <%maenos2> As opposed to a human in a filter eith a badly photodhopped hand
[0:26:55] <+Ches_Neckbeard> they bothered because weirdo's are desperate to fuck their space waifu in fanfix
[0:26:58] <CheesesSliced> Andromeda is the best game ever made
[0:27:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What did I misss, Just got here
[0:27:02] <%Robot_Nixon_> MCU 'aliens' atpRtsd
[0:27:03] <%Valdorick> They're close to humans because Bioware are COWARDS. "We only want to bang if the tags are vanilla"
[0:27:04] <%Garthunox> well pat, her mask is purple, some other quarians have orange or grey or green masks
[0:27:05] <%Jeemukun> to be fair, even in the original concept art for ME1 Quarians still looked human under there
[0:27:08] <Brandon__Brando> Punished pat
[0:27:10] <HaroldDonchee> wah
[0:27:10] <%SirGO0SE> THE DARK PAT Rises!
[0:27:10] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Did you see Square is running two separate feeds? One licensed music one free use
[0:27:15] <%dankjerri> run
[0:27:15] <@SoFarFetched> "which one" is ominous
[0:27:20] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Do you think they should've written the ME trilogy in advance before development?
[0:27:21] <tolloponik> why not just remove the picture entirely and keep the mystery of what they look like
[0:27:22] <%heartlesshealer> paige at risk?
[0:27:26] <+FxyDEV> Im just here to figure out how this ninjutsu game loop works
[0:27:28] <%ssjklyco> Trouble is a foot
[0:27:29] <PinoProxie> i have the art book for me1 and the quarian concept art is so alien and cool
[0:27:29] <tanarath> SLIMED
[0:27:30] <+spartanghost004> he is your spirit animal
[0:27:31] <%watts121> Like no wonder Tali got hot for shepard...he's basically a naked quarian male 24/7 to her.

[0:28:06] <@SoFarFetched> @TurtlesAndTentacles paige destroyed his lights
[0:28:09] <%valriot> To be fair, they never settled on a quarian design, its why we never got a female turian until ONE in Omega DLC, and then Andromeda

[0:31:32] <%AbnormalVoid> JANUARY 22
[0:31:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> AND IT LOOKS GREAT
[0:31:36] <%dankjerri> AND PAIGE WAS IN IT
[0:31:37] <TheViltsuZ> I didn't watch the trailer. Going into these games as blind as possible is the best way. Their trailers always show all the bosses and such which takes away from the exploration and mystery imo. I did however catch very brief glimpses because I had to feed my curiosity and those few seconds I saw looked fucking amazing. Best way to play these games is not knowing anything and discovering all by yourself.

[0:33:43] <PinoProxie> yuf-ee
[0:33:50] <CheesesSliced> Pat looks like he's at a slow rave
[0:33:52] <rekinom> What did you and Paige think of Evil Dead By Daylight ?

[0:34:47] <%KishinGrek> @dankjerri get out.
[0:34:48] <%ironohki> @majindusto old habits
[0:34:50] <Solvari> Berseria is dope
[0:34:50] <DatAsuna> pretty much, I assume they meant
[0:34:52] <%Monkeyweed21> her name is Yiffies
[0:34:52] <%AbnormalVoid> Berseria's system was balls
[0:34:54] <%patriotrenegade> pronounces it Yufee just to annoy nerds @PatStaresAt
[0:35:00] <DatAsuna> Berseria is like one of the worst though lol
[0:35:02] <$Ziegsy> Hey pat, just a heads up. you change your element in the action menu. took me half a chapter to work out you dont just hit left or right
[0:35:02] <%dankjerri> I can't. the doors are locked
[0:35:03] <Zeif00> The only good thing about tales is the battle system
[0:35:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> how do type english
[0:35:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Berseria is great
[0:35:05] <%Jekado> still miss the old 2d battle system
[0:35:07] <+MelodyMedley> Magilou be good
[0:35:07] <%MonsterEnvy> I loved Berseria's system
[0:35:08] <DatAsuna> It's just not as bad as the one before it
[0:35:08] <%MisterRockett> Play Tales of Xillia.
[0:35:08] <Srthunda> I thought you were talking about the sonic character
[0:35:10] <ashuckel> Tales is crazy about the incest
[0:35:11] <DatAsuna> So it was a relief
[0:35:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Epic Battle Fantasy 5 is still my favorite JRPG
[0:35:12] <Oxybe> You-Fee
[0:35:16] <%kewlmyc> The McDonalds of JRPGs
[0:35:16] <%MisterRockett> ????????
[0:35:17] <%Jekado> oh yeah story is... not great
[0:35:18] <@SoFarFetched> Tales of Series confirmed All Cringe
[0:35:18] <hat_under_bread> Then they make you do tons of it until it gets boring and the stories haven't been good since I was 14.
[0:35:19] <%jofrankii> yeeeah
[0:35:21] <%AzureGale> JRPGs in a nutshell
[0:35:21] <$LightningLynx89> You're Cringe Pat!
[0:35:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Which Tales of have you played Pat?
[0:35:25] <@StridentSong> At the same time, the problem with Tales is the way the battle system works is different each game
[0:35:25] <%KuroStardust> L
[0:35:27] <%Valdorick> Which "it"
[0:35:27] <DatAsuna> Xillia is nice as a longtime fan but it's very budget
[0:35:27] <%heartlesshealer> Berseria's story is okay, but hmmmmmmmmmmm
[0:35:28] <%ssjklyco> Tales has a lot of "Oh, this isn't the final part"
[0:35:29] <SunsetJack> I think Tales also has a nice replayability.
[0:35:29] <%MisterRockett> Which one?
[0:35:30] <blackjack8182> Berseria’s great
[0:35:31] <%Garthunox> arent you cringe?
[0:35:31] <$Futurecity10> Blame the english voice acting for that
[0:35:33] <%blastazoid00> Why is it so dark?
[0:35:33] <Wolfstriker121> STAR OCEAN 2 BY FAR THE BEST!!! and should be a remake on it! <3
[0:35:33] <oceanmatt> which one
[0:35:33] <%jackythefrost> Berseria is great
[0:35:35] <%KishinGrek> @kewlmyc what does that mean?
[0:35:35] <DatAsuna> You can feel how rushed Xillia was
[0:35:36] <Sprawler14> They are going to lose subscriber
[0:35:36] <Nordguy> its based wtf pat
[0:35:37] <%dankjerri> even worse than Valkyria Chornicles
[0:35:37] <%Monkeyweed21> BERSERIA IS GREAT
[0:35:37] <+MelodyMedley> Oh of course
[0:35:38] <%athuramn> but our feelings will be our greatest strength though
[0:35:38] <+CelioHogane> They literally changed the combat system so now that it's not Co-op animore, why would i ever give a fuck about that saga.
[0:35:39] <hat_under_bread> Also holy balls are the graphics behind these days.
[0:35:43] <%Jekado> yeah
[0:35:43] <%the38bandit> but yuri tho......
[0:35:43] <DatAsuna> Destiny is very 90s
[0:35:44] <PinoProxie> animu cringe
[0:35:45] <Garnetguy98> You don’t like anime
[0:35:45] <@StridentSong> Also every game since Symphonia has used the exact same "Two worlds vying for resources" storyline
[0:35:47] <%heartlesshealer> PAT WHY VESPERIA NO
[0:35:47] <%Monkeyweed21> but pat you are cringe
[0:35:49] <+Kyma1020> gotchya
[0:35:50] <Zeif00> Yuri was cool
[0:35:53] <doggieo> But I love Skits
[0:35:58] <hat_under_bread> Edna was cute at least.
[0:35:58] <+xerioes> even the dog?
[0:35:59] <%Garthunox> Vesperia sucks
[0:36:00] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[0:36:01] <Vaunno> no YOU'RE cringe, tales is based and redpilled KAppa
[0:36:02] <%dankjerri> good
[0:36:02] <@SoFarFetched> I cant believe someone subscribed to pat to talk shit about their game.
[0:36:03] <%Monkeyweed21> BERSERIA IS GREAT PLAY IT
[0:36:03] <%KishinGrek> play Us instead
[0:36:05] <%Ipsenscastle> Tales is almost as cringe as Star Ocean and nappytime with Edgie
[0:36:06] <%AzureGale> Quitter
[0:36:06] <%MisterRockett> dual knife kid? you mean the dog?
[0:36:07] <DatAsuna> dual knife?
[0:36:07] <%jofrankii> LO
[0:36:08] <%jackythefrost> Vesperia is overrated
[0:36:09] <$Futurecity10> KAROL IS BASED FUCK OFF
[0:36:09] <Dabrikishaw> @StridentSong THAT repetative?
[0:36:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Vesperia's system is way overrated, and all the ways it's good are never actually taught to you in any meaningful way
[0:36:10] <hat_under_bread> Oh wait, wrong game.
[0:36:10] <%Delenay> i got 2 hours into ves b4 turning it off
[0:36:10] <skeletonkingofmanlets> this looks like hell
[0:36:12] <Solvari> I liked Zestiria and Berseria but I can see why people dont like tales games
[0:36:12] <+SeventhVice> dual knife kid?
[0:36:13] <oceanmatt> understandable have a nice day
[0:36:15] <DatAsuna> I assume he means patty
[0:36:15] <%Maids4lyfe> Is Pat darker than usual or is it just me?
[0:36:15] <Sokawaiibebe> Berseria is great
[0:36:16] <+michingmallecho> Tales of Berseria though
[0:36:16] <$ringabal> Symphonia bros...
[0:36:17] <%KishinGrek> play Ys Instead
[0:36:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> there was a dual knife kid in vesperia?
[0:36:17] <%Jekado> @SoFarFetched I can
[0:36:17] <%heartlesshealer> you chose wrong with vesperia
[0:36:18] <%echobee_tv> psaBig being correct on twitter Pat
[0:36:20] <%the38bandit> but yuri and doggo
[0:36:20] <$Futurecity10> Karol
[0:36:21] <%cvp5127> dual knife girl
[0:36:21] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe Rita
[0:36:24] <%MisterRockett> There's no dual knife character in Vesperia.
[0:36:24] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt but you can kill your party members SeemsGood
[0:36:24] <supergoblinpunch> Glass houses Pat
[0:36:25] <%Sirakou> Karol's a dweeb
[0:36:25] <DatAsuna> Was she a pirate?
[0:36:28] <Astrophizz> can Gief smoke a pipe?
[0:36:31] <+SeventhVice> theres no dual knife kid in vesperia
[0:36:32] <@SoFarFetched> "Pat Imma give you 5 dollars to shit on my favorite game series"
[0:36:33] <%dankjerri> new pants
[0:36:36] <$Futurecity10> KAROL
[0:36:39] <%Torus1025> Bersaria is less cringe
[0:36:40] <@StridentSong> They keep treating it like it's a surprise twist. it stopped being a surprise after Symphonia
[0:36:42] <%AzureGale> Droite? Gauche?
[0:36:43] <Charbic> Played only 2 games and judges the whole series. NotLikeThis
[0:36:44] <Wolfstriker121> legend of dragoon should be remaked....it was very very very good
[0:36:46] <+Kyma1020> Zesteria and Berseria are all right
[0:36:47] <%the38bandit> karol does suck tho
[0:36:48] <DatAsuna> She's a gun knife kid but yeah
[0:36:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Karol?
[0:36:49] <+MightyDuckShoes> is he talking about the Bowman who can split his weapon in two?
[0:36:51] <%weissguard> Oh yeah, no. Vesperia has an awful cast.
[0:36:51] <%kewlmyc> @KishinGrek Great games, but kinda churned out and doesn't stand out much. This coming from a fan who has sunk 1000+ hours into multiple games.
[0:36:51] <Zeif00> Karol does indeed suck
[0:36:52] <+Kyma1020> aaaaa yeah
[0:36:53] <%dankjerri> backedpack
[0:36:53] <%heartlesshealer> Tales of Phantasia at least has some shoehorned GBA voice acting you can make fun with
[0:36:54] <%MisterRockett> The hammer kid?
[0:36:55] <%MonsterEnvy> I like Karol
[0:36:56] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, Karol sucks
[0:36:57] <%AbnormalVoid> @Wolfstriker121 facts
[0:36:57] <%Valdorick> Bersraira trades cringe for edge
[0:36:59] <%Nekros4442> yes he sucks
[0:37:00] <doggieo> Patty
[0:37:00] <%doomunderthestairs> Grace f seems alright
[0:37:02] <%StormBuster24> Karol is bad for about an hour and then he's fine the rest of the game
[0:37:02] <CivHistory> that's karol, yeah he does suck
[0:37:02] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Karol sucks but he didn't use two knoves
[0:37:02] <%MisterRockett> He uses a hammer
[0:37:03] <%weissguard> *To a point
[0:37:04] <skeletonkingofmanlets> Tales of vesperia sucks and the story goes nowhere
[0:37:04] <%Caped_Eggy> Tales of Vesparia?
[0:37:05] <%Garthunox> yeah Karol sucks
[0:37:06] <%AbnormalVoid> Karol blows LUL
[0:37:07] <$Futurecity10> Zestria sucks ass
[0:37:07] <DatAsuna> Oh Karol, yeah his whole arc is about realising that he sucks
[0:37:07] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah, Karol.
[0:37:07] <+Kyma1020> Karol isn't great
[0:37:12] <%a_goth_pancake> this sounds like Ginseng from Indivisible.
[0:37:12] <%heartlesshealer> even Tales of Graces is more fun
[0:37:13] <+MightyDuckShoes> Raven was cool tho
[0:37:13] <+michingmallecho> Berseria was my first Tales game...I made the right choice. GlitchCat
[0:37:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Berseria isnt cringe its edge-pilled
[0:37:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> LUL LUL LUL
[0:37:19] <randomahole> !uptime
[0:37:19] <@Moobot> @randomahole I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 39s.
[0:37:19] <blackjack8182> I hate him
[0:37:24] <Eppielicious> did someone say legend of dragoon
[0:37:24] <%Garthunox> @StormBuster24 you can beat Vesperia in an hour?
[0:37:27] <majindusto> My first Tales game  was Tales of Abyss
[0:37:27] <%jackythefrost> Zesteria was so bad it cause a massive controversy in Japan
[0:37:29] <Solvari> I mean they are all very anime
[0:37:30] <%dooscent> @Wolfstriker121 more characters should have the surname of Slambert
[0:37:34] <%MisterRockett> to be fair there's a Karol equivalent in every game.
[0:37:36] <%the38bandit> the arrow old guy and the dragoon is cool
[0:37:39] <artoflec> yeah Berseria was fucking cool, i was not expecting how dark that game gets
[0:37:41] <%dankjerri> but shes upstairs
[0:37:44] <DatAsuna> Tales has a lot of characters that are meant to be lame in the first act and have to deal with it and change in the second/third
[0:37:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> I only played Symphonia 2. Got a lot of mileage out of it.
[0:37:46] <%AbnormalVoid> Graces had the best battle system but the rest was pretty forgettable
[0:37:48] <majindusto> *Tales of the Abyss
[0:37:49] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt you disliking a character pretty much guarantees they're a good character
[0:37:50] <%dankjerri> just yell
[0:37:50] <%doomunderthestairs> Pat you planning on getting strive if so PC or PS5?
[0:37:51] <+TopTieramisu> is silksong the new elden ring?
[0:37:55] <DatAsuna> But it does make for bad first impressions
[0:37:56] <%Valdorick> Though, Berseria is cringe via the transitive property, because its a prequal to Zesty
[0:37:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Berseria is so edgy at times it loops around to be hilarious, great game though, I loved it
[0:38:02] <DatAsuna> I like graces but it has the worst first act
[0:38:04] <%Delenay> bes and symph are the only good ones ive played
[0:38:06] <%maenos2> didn't someone from the tales devs go on to make that bomb of a gacha game Sakura Wars gscha?
[0:38:08] <2guard> so is Intergrade a SEQUEL or a re-release of FF7Remake???
[0:38:12] <%dankjerri> TRUE
[0:38:13] <$ringabal> Ruh Roh
[0:38:14] <DatAsuna> Ashley says otherwise
[0:38:16] <Wolfstriker121> @PatStaresAt have you ever tryed it out or heard of it, legend of dragoon?
[0:38:20] <tranquilturnip> Ashley Williams LUL
[0:38:22] <%AbnormalVoid> Pee Swocker
[0:38:26] <%dankjerri> YES
[0:38:26] <+RobPiresLu> why so dark?
[0:38:28] <DatAsuna> Yes actually.
[0:38:28] <+CelioHogane> Yeah sure
[0:38:29] <%Maids4lyfe> Yes
[0:38:29] <RyuuAoi> Does Elmo even talk to u anymore, Pat?
[0:38:30] <%Valdorick> Symph, Abyss, and Bersira are great.
[0:38:32] <%Maids4lyfe> It is now
[0:38:33] <majindusto> Yes
[0:38:35] <%MrMegaJackpots> yea
[0:38:36] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA
[0:38:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> I KNEW be was going to comment on that message
[0:38:39] <+BIumen> well its not really a character but also yes
[0:38:39] <%MidnightBurst12> robots are always good characters
[0:38:39] <%dankjerri> robots are good
[0:38:39] <%heartlesshealer> @AbnormalVoid That's what I mean, the battle system on its own puts it ahead of vesperia as a whole, despite story. =X
[0:38:40] <artoflec> Pat can you turn your light on I can't hear you
[0:38:40] <%Cykron> Pee Swocker

[0:39:20] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt Data point of one: I actually rather enjoyed Peace Walker. Not so much the robot itself, but the game in general.
[0:39:24] <DatAsuna> The mammal pod is only bad if you try to interpret it as literally being her.
[0:39:24] <+wmeldrum> I like old tech trying to be futuristic?

[0:40:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @CelioHogane Fun Fact: I literally modded the game just so she could wear clothes that weren't falling to pieces, helps the serious scenes immensely

[0:44:49] <dan_g_v> @discodemolition the stream got claimed
[0:44:51] <Solvari> Depends on the content
[0:44:52] <+EdeninShambles> Doesnt it run on an engine from like 06

[0:45:57] <%valriot> So i can fart on a plane????
[0:45:57] <%dankjerri> so you dont notice
[0:45:59] <DatAsuna> Same reason shit tastes different in say, mountain towns
[0:45:59] <ashuckel> being able to taste things is mostly the sense of smell
[0:46:00] <$ringabal> Can't have shit in the sky
[0:46:01] <Broken_Sonex> Ohhhhhhh
[0:46:01] <%maskofmichael> Just sandbag the Elcor bit, did ya
[0:46:03] <RyuuAoi> Idk i just drink the drinks
[0:46:04] <ToneBacas> so would submarine food be enhanced?
[0:46:05] <+MightyDuckShoes> no wonder even the sandwiches I smuggle onboard don't taste so good
[0:46:05] <%heartlesshealer> that's science baby
[0:46:06] <olaksi> no
[0:46:08] <%linSP> As someone with a good sense of smell, I really like airline food
[0:46:10] <%solracc25> nah but the food is shite
[0:46:10] <%heyitsbrian> what's the deal with mountain food?
[0:46:11] <%valriot> Poggggg
[0:46:13] <blue2red> boo that punchline
[0:46:14] <%strakillias> Does that mean submarine food kicks ass?
[0:46:18] <trav2_> I can and I will
[0:46:19] <Vaunno> on today's edition of brain pat's learning time
[0:46:20] <mar_krow> Dark pat stares at
[0:46:21] <$Faustgesicht> All those peanuts unfairly perscuted
[0:46:21] <Kindred_808> Learn something new every day
[0:46:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that's oddly specific
[0:46:23] <%Maids4lyfe> farting is buffed on planes
[0:46:24] <%Caped_Eggy> One of the best food I have had was on a plane
[0:46:24] <Zeif00> That won't stop it
[0:46:26] <%BinaryFireball> is there an app to measure my farts?
[0:46:27] <%maskedsongbird> Although to be fair, I only ever thought of airline food as just something to keep my stomach from getting angry if the flight is too long.
[0:46:28] <%valriot> Dump ass right next to that dickhead child
[0:46:29] <%shurtal> Just as silent, even more deadly
[0:46:30] <+TaylOctopus91> @discodemolition I'm sad. I wanted to watch the VOD of Summer Games Fest too
[0:46:30] <%maskedsongbird> Not really for taste
[0:46:31] <Oxybe> open a window
[0:46:32] <%BinaryFireball> I dont want to overdo the farts
[0:46:35] <%jackythefrost> SO it doesnt matter if the foods good or bad it tastes the same?
[0:46:35] <%Ipsenscastle> I like airplane food but I'm British, so I like bland
[0:46:37] <Sprawler14> That many people on a plane? No one'll know it was me.
[0:46:39] <ToneBacas> damn i wanna eat in a submarine now to test that theory
[0:46:40] <%derpy_platypus> @strakillias sub food sucks ass
[0:46:45] <Coystick> When Bloodborne 2?
[0:46:47] <TheViltsuZ> I didn't watch the trailer. Going into these games as blind as possible is the best way. Their trailers always show all the bosses and such which takes away from the exploration and mystery imo. I did however catch very brief glimpses because I had to feed my curiosity and those few seconds I saw looked fucking amazing. Best way to play these games is not knowing anything and discovering all by yourself.
[0:46:48] <$Ziegsy> wasnt there a rumour that the guy who opens the plane door after a flight gets paid extra because of the farts?
[0:46:48] <Sunstalker> Now that just makes me laugh even more at dipshit rich people dining in private jets LUL
[0:46:50] <Kindred_808> Japan air has good stuff
[0:46:51] <+megaman_sentinel> will this b on the u tubes
[0:46:54] <%Monkeyweed21> REALER THAN WOOLIE
[0:46:56] <laserbeaming> same trailer that leaked, but looked good
[0:46:57] <%maskedsongbird> Okay, so I've clearly been living in a cave. WTF is Elden Ring?
[0:46:59] <%patriotrenegade> Like the way you think people cant hear your farts?
[0:47:00] <%Dfreddy8> So now we're just waiting on Bayo 3 news
[0:47:01] <%echobee_tv> psaBig real trailer
[0:47:01] <%BinaryFireball> lots of bosses in the elden riiing
[0:47:02] <ToneBacas> LUL
[0:47:03] <%Maids4lyfe> was that Seath in that trailer?
[0:47:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's significantly different

[0:59:31] <%maskedsongbird> I've gotta be honest, even while watching Red XIII fight in motion, I still can't quite grasp how it's supposed to work. Like, is he biting enemies, tackling them, what's going on there...?
[0:59:33] <Wolfstriker121> this is really legit ff 14 ninja <3  im loving it
[0:59:38] <majindusto> I WANT VINCENT TO PLAY LIKE DIRGE OF CERBERUS enigmaKEK
[0:59:44] <$Ziegsy> You can switch at any time I think
[0:59:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> y'all say that but I bet she'll get a trick attack for sure
[0:59:47] <+CelioHogane> @yourliteraldog Devil May Cry 1 dante, to be specific, since SHOTGUN
[0:59:48] <Solvari> Trash NIN not using Trick Attack
[0:59:51] <$ringabal> @maskedsongbird He's trying his best
[0:59:52] <xeros720> well, if it's an atb, maybe you can just use it to switch it whenever you want?
[0:59:54] <+THOUTHPAW> this is making me excited to try ninja in xiv
[0:59:57] <%dankjerri> vincent will play like gears of war
[1:00:00] <%coreyyotto> what she used was the fire ninjutusu, there is no earth element so far
[1:00:02] <+senfood> I love how the music switches between battle and walking.
[1:00:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the element lasts the whole fight
[1:00:10] <Jynnanmalect> @maskedsongbird yes
[1:00:19] <%maskedsongbird> Vincent should play like DMC. I feel like that would make the most sense.
[1:00:20] <randomahole> did she skin a Moogle, to make that kigurumi?
[1:00:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> @dankjerri Screaming like a psychopath while doing it too
[1:00:40] <$Ziegsy> @coreyyotto it was non elemental earth blast
[1:00:40] <Jynnanmalect> vincent will bring back the parasite eve 3rd birthday game play
[1:00:41] <+LionKagura> Pat the boxes...
[1:00:42] <xeros720> it seems like it's character thing
[1:00:44] <%Ipsenscastle> The moogle poncho is pretty sick
[1:00:46] <+CelioHogane> @randomahole Moogles are not real in FF7
[1:00:49] <%dankjerri> @galacticaphanto and when he limit breaks it turns into MadWorld
[1:00:56] <$Pompadourius> You mean you didn't in the original?
[1:00:58] <%ExpressNode> If every remembers in 5 years....
[1:01:00] <majindusto> It wasn't  even a moohle outfit  in DoC
[1:01:04] <olaksi> i believe in moogles
[1:01:09] <majindusto> *Moogle
[1:01:10] <+zzNamttamzz> Vincent will be playing an FPS
[1:01:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Three simultaneous character action games
[1:01:12] <%gitgouda> hell yeah
[1:01:12] <tralfamad0re> cloud tifa red crew
[1:01:13] <%AbnormalVoid> Yuffie rules in the original
[1:01:13] <yourliteraldog> Moogles are real in heart
[1:01:15] <tattleworm> presumably they'll nerf her in the party, nobody else comes close to her skillset
[1:01:16] <%sporeian94> >He didn't do Yuffie Cait Sith
[1:01:16] <$Pompadourius> I went Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie by the end tbh
[1:01:16] <%ironohki> Cloud Tifa Red was my party too
[1:01:21] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt FYI, shes a glass cannon, blocking is imperative and dodging even more so. Expect like 500 damage THROUGH BLOCK on some enemies
[1:01:22] <artoflec> CBR
[1:01:25] <%MisterRockett> what about when you couldn't use them?
[1:01:31] <+AutechreTwinAphex> no more disguised loading screens in this DLC finally
[1:01:31] <%sporeian94> PAt what'
[1:01:33] <%RetroCop87> She loses 80% of the coolness the instant she joins the loser party
[1:01:36] <Airuzen> playable Red13 is gonna be SO interesting
[1:01:36] <+Buzzkill983> I was a Cloud, Yuffie, Tifa guy myself.
[1:01:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Mine was Cloud, Tifa and LT Black man. Thats what i called Barrett
[1:01:40] <%Ipsenscastle> I used Vincent because I was a goth loser
[1:01:40] <%sporeian94> Pat what would be the worst FF7 OG party?
[1:01:44] <yourliteraldog> Also Imagine moogles where real but you know pollution and shit
[1:01:44] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> psaElmo
[1:01:46] <+megaman_sentinel> tifa red yuffie
[1:01:46] <%LaughingCatt> also she has NO PROBLEM WITH FLYING ENEMIES lobosHype
[1:01:53] <majindusto> Yuffie  was ALWAYS  a part of my party when i got her
[1:01:54] <frostyjay3> In the original Yuffie was kind of a tank on my play through so she stayed in the party most of the time
[1:01:55] <xeros720> emlo is here

[1:02:21] <+megaman_sentinel> your in my way human lol
[1:02:24] <cnry_m> Cat!
[1:02:26] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I was kinda hoping they would carry over the team based attacks from this DLC into the main game but I guess we will get that for Part 2
[1:02:32] <%maskedsongbird> One more thing that I can add in the "Pro" list of FF7R changes/improvements. Yuffie is actually cool and not annoying. We're, what, five minutes in and I don't even want to strangle her, not even a little. Progress!
[1:02:36] <battlexqueen> this music is so good
[1:02:42] <%valriot> Art of War certainly better than the shitty SCH version in 14 LUL LUL
[1:02:48] <majindusto> Can you turn voices  up?
[1:03:00] <%echobee_tv> psaBig psaWink psaBlep psaPorgmo psaGib
[1:03:02] <$ringabal> PAT POISON
[1:03:04] <%ironohki> death
[1:03:05] <tattleworm> they gave her perfect blocks for a reason, yeah
[1:03:06] <+AutechreTwinAphex> looks like this is the only character where aerial combat doesn't suck
[1:03:11] <$Pompadourius> Sure would be nice to play this myself some day, but sadly the PS5 is a myth. I'm almost tempted to give in to scalpers. LUL
[1:03:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> 1hp and a dream
[1:03:14] <Vaunno> glass cannon?
[1:03:19] <$Ziegsy> Pat once you get the second weapon you get substitution jutsu and that changes the game
[1:03:20] <+shadowsvrse> do rasengan
[1:03:26] <+spartanghost004> that cloak looks pretty cool
[1:03:30] <xeros720> seriously, she seems tailor made to deal with aerial threats of all kinds
[1:03:37] <%maskedsongbird> @Pompadourius Don't give in. It's never worth it.
[1:03:45] <tattleworm> all creation was cool
[1:03:47] <+FxyDEV> so how is this like ff14 ninja combat wise? Im interested
[1:03:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> Time to download this music
[1:03:52] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Told you she was a glass cannon
[1:03:56] <%Ipsenscastle> She has to carry a 6-8 hr campaign solo, so she'd better play well
[1:03:59] <Solvari> Doesn't this come to PC eventually anyway?
[1:04:04] <Basch71> I'd imagine her ninjutsu are nice for flexibility but you'd use materia for immediate damage
[1:04:05] <%asgard147> limesS
[1:04:06] <+Ironbuttz> it's so smooth it hurts my eyes'
[1:04:06] <%megadblitz> @pompadourius don't give in, with that much money you can buy 2 ps5 consoles at retail
[1:04:08] <%MisterRockett> I could never even find if she was better at using steal materia in the original game.
[1:04:10] <$ringabal> 48 SEPHIROTHS
[1:04:11] <reonome> KINGDOM HEARTS?
[1:04:11] <ape_hawk> hey, its marco!

[1:04:39] <Airuzen> LMAO she really only focuses on the pom
[1:04:40] <Louie_Salmon> Uh
[1:04:43] <randomahole> steal his materia, materia thief
[1:04:46] <xeros720> guy just wants to make it to little caeser's
[1:04:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> that's not realistic
[1:04:47] <yourliteraldog> Just a heroin addict
[1:04:47] <reonome> REUNION
[1:04:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's probably fine
[1:04:51] <JetpackMcQuack> probably drugs
[1:04:52] <+D00msDayDan> look out he's gonna take your arm
[1:04:56] <%MisterRockett> @yourliteraldog That was a Dale line!
[1:04:57] <$Ziegsy> One of them has a beard and its WILD
[1:04:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> just a guy who are sick
[1:04:58] <%KineticZen> A Palpatine
[1:05:01] <majindusto> THEY EXISTED BEFORE  KINGDOM  HEARTS CHAT
[1:05:02] <+Buzzkill983> The plight of the Inner City of Midgar
[1:05:04] <%TheLemuroid> Remember when Reunion was an endgame thing
[1:05:04] <%ironohki> Eat drugs
[1:05:04] <%Valdorick> You could JUMP that, Yuffie
[1:05:05] <%AbnormalVoid> just a normal hobo
[1:05:08] <%condemned_15> what
[1:05:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> more than just crates Pog
[1:05:09] <supergoblinpunch> That's a Xehanort
[1:05:09] <%megadblitz> @maskedsongbird that's as much as two ones
[1:05:10] <%toolofparanoia> CLONEROTH
[1:05:10] <%Valdorick> DA BABY!

[1:05:33] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt Let's be real, regular drug addicts are probably super common in the Midgar slums. These Reunion dudes would fit right in.
[1:05:34] <cureneckbeard> emlo
[1:05:35] <+Punchasaur> His hair is glued to his eyelids
[1:05:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Engwithan_Elder_God subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Keep on keeping on.
[1:05:39] <LoneFonte> i hope so
[1:05:43] <RaidenRising> damn you xehanorts
[1:05:44] <%linSP> yo what was up with that cat at the end of remake 1
[1:05:44] <xeros720> i always thought barret was gonna get more weapon options
[1:06:02] <majindusto> Voice seems too quiet
[1:06:03] <%ExpressNode> Give him a boomerang arm
[1:06:07] <$Pompadourius> MAN, I wonder if Vincent will end up being the coolest to play in Remake's combat system.
[1:06:09] <xeros720> not his regular weapon, his triangle move will be swapped
[1:06:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Barret had that in his solo section already @PatStaresAt
[1:06:12] <hat_under_bread> Barret needs a Serious Sam cannon option.
[1:06:17] <devanmuse> You think there will eventually be a party selector? Or will the story railroad you with a specific party for specific sequences?
[1:06:18] <Airuzen> I hope they float SOME of her aerial combat to Cloud too
[1:06:23] <+FxyDEV> so is that her loop? throw into ninjutsu?
[1:06:25] <%greencapps> How's the rumble?
[1:06:29] <%condemned_15> ah man. When Vincent shows up in remake, people are gonna get so porked up
[1:06:34] <+megaman_sentinel> Vincent might end up being op
[1:06:44] <$Pompadourius> Wow those are LITERALLY the FFXIV mudras surrounding her huh?! LUL
[1:06:47] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL pat forgot about hold attacks
[1:06:50] <Vaunno> rumble of the HD variety, so immersive you dont even notice it
[1:06:52] <+MoonObscure> YYEAH
[1:06:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEAH HE DOES
[1:06:58] <%sporeian94> He got cucked by Hojo
[1:06:58] <+Kaask> you mean cid?
[1:06:59] <tolloponik> this is already making me going from hating to enjoying yuffi
[1:06:59] <+spartanghost004> Does he though?
[1:07:01] <devanmuse> Vincent is the only one to get his own game!
[1:07:01] <xeros720> the joke is, if a character went invincible and fuckin berserk in this battle engine, that wouldn't be bad
[1:07:02] <yourliteraldog> He will have a devil trigger
[1:07:02] <%weissguard> psaBig psaWrong
[1:07:04] <$ringabal> Everyone except his wife...
[1:07:04] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Vincents gameplay will be Gears of War :P
[1:07:04] <Psyramics> Vincent's Limit Break was transformations, he's gonna have multiple forms
[1:07:06] <%Ipsenscastle> I too used to think Vincent ruled, and then I played his game ...
[1:07:06] <ape_hawk> vincent gets cucked by hojo, he isnt cool
[1:07:07] <+King_floppy> BIG LOVE FOR VINCENT
[1:07:08] <$Ziegsy> @FxyDEV you can do, you can also throw and teleport and use close range. She also has a perfect dodge for up close too
[1:07:08] <majindusto> Yep
[1:07:08] <+senfood> HOOOOOJOOOOO
[1:07:08] <%BigCoffee> Imagine if Vincent isn't in th second game, and is also DLC at the end like Yuffie
[1:07:08] <beefcakemanthrob> yo, but what about Cait Sith?
[1:07:10] <Albedo28> I hope vincent gets some stupid call backs to dirge of cerberus
[1:07:12] <+shadowsvrse> i think vincent's a fuck!
[1:07:12] <Blank9> vincent is going to be destroyed by cuck
[1:07:13] <%maskedsongbird> So I'm only realizing this in retrospect, but how much of Kingdom Hearts's character designs and plot points just recycled ideas Nomura had during OG FF7 that he never got around to implementing, and that's why we're seeing similar stuff in FF7R?
[1:07:14] <%Dementedpenguin> I have no attachment Vincent because I found him before the final boss fight LUL
[1:07:15] <%gitgouda> @sporeian94 still hurts to think about
[1:07:17] <%Monkeyweed21> HES JUST GONNA BE A GOOD DoC GAME
[1:07:17] <Broken_Sonex> The coolest cuck
[1:07:19] <%Dementedpenguin> *to
[1:07:20] <+rpgojira> Dirge of Cerberus 4ever!
[1:07:21] <Tapperfa> He;s in the cuck coffin pat pls
[1:07:22] <%BigCoffee> You love vincent but he's never on your team????
[1:07:24] <Shade075> it would be funny if Vincent plays like dirge of cerberus
[1:07:25] <+Buzzkill983> Vincent was prototype edgy Dante
[1:07:25] <+spartanghost004> I mean the man lost to hojo
[1:07:26] <%condemned_15> press X to steal
[1:07:27] <%maskedsongbird> Like seriously, drawing a lot of parallels between the Reunion fucks and Org XIII
[1:07:31] <randomahole> Is Vincent even going to be in 7-2? Or will we have to wait until 7-3?
[1:07:32] <%maskofmichael> When Vincent isn't around, everyone should be asking "Where's Vincent?"
[1:07:32] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> The moogle is way forwewar
[1:07:35] <silvcrest> Thats why dirge was so good, right?    right?
[1:07:36] <$Ziegsy> disregard moogle, receive loot
[1:07:39] <+AutechreTwinAphex> imagine another shooter game like Dirge
[1:07:41] <+Punchasaur> Bincent
[1:07:43] <%sporeian94> PAt the moogle sign lol
[1:07:43] <$Ziegsy> thats progress
[1:07:54] <+megaman_sentinel> a vampire with guns op
[1:07:54] <godzookylives> his transformations better be crazy
[1:07:56] <Vaunno> haha GOTTEM
[1:07:56] <%Monkeyweed21> WOW PATS DUMB
[1:07:57] <%heyitsbrian> I kind of want the party limit to increase, at least to 4, so we can see more character animations
[1:07:58] <missingangle> DANG, gottem!

[1:08:23] <%maskedsongbird> I mean, I'm pretty sure even the slum residents would probably agree with her...
[1:08:24] <+CelioHogane> @Valdorick there is no slums where she is from, tho
[1:08:28] <%ironohki> Am cat
[1:08:31] <+Punchasaur> Garbage like Vincent

[1:09:44] <$Ziegsy> A mastered hp up is a GODSEND

[1:09:56] <%Ne1son> Be good instead
[1:09:57] <xeros720> yeah in this the character levels max out at 50, so a fully leveled hp up gives you a ton of survivability
[1:10:03] <+Buzzkill983> Big Hp is to let you learn until you can big numbers

[1:17:06] <+Kaask> i hope the other characters get a bit more mechanical depth in the next games
[1:17:08] <PirateMike_> Is this a new remake?
[1:17:11] <iheartmota> Can she self buff for 70 secs for atk speed?
[1:17:11] <%BigCoffee> I bet you will still only use Red13 and Tifa when the next game come sout :p
[1:17:12] <%LaughingCatt> it works pretty well
[1:17:14] <%condemned_15> ladder
[1:17:16] <yourliteraldog> Moogle
[1:17:17] <Albedo28> can't wait for the no-hit run.
[1:17:17] <tanarath> It does seem easier
[1:17:18] <%athuramn> she's a glass cannon?
[1:17:21] <brisk_dacat> Who’s the Organization 13 member in the shredded cloak?
[1:17:21] <+CelioHogane> @ComicReliefHero Who could have guessed that an expansion would not be full new assets.
[1:17:22] <+qanonisadeathcult> i feel like you're being catty
[1:17:22] <%toolofparanoia> Uraahhh
[1:17:22] <%maskedsongbird> Been a couple of years since I played FFXIV. Might have to pick my subscription back up some time.
[1:17:24] <iheartmota> and land trick attacks after suiton?
[1:17:25] <%BinaryFireball> its almost like you have to play a game instead of select the attack option
[1:17:26] <+michingmallecho> I think this is a sign that Part 2 is going to be alright GlitchCat
[1:17:27] <xeros720> not yet at least
[1:17:27] <%Dfreddy8> 16 year old girls don't have that much health tbh.
[1:17:28] <%Cykron> @ironohki I am Appalachia people as well
[1:17:37] <%코코꾸라> Hamauzu king
[1:17:38] <LoneFonte> @PirateMike_ DLC chapter
[1:17:40] <%LaughingCatt> She doesnt really need to buff her attack speed tho she crazy fast
[1:17:41] <yourliteraldog> High risk high Reward fits her well
[1:17:42] <%sporeian94> How old is Yuffie. Like 11?
[1:17:42] <JetpackMcQuack> That's a big pipe
[1:17:45] <Mattais88> All the remake OST is amazing
[1:17:51] <+Vigonept> i dont like the really high violin notes in the beginning
[1:17:55] <%jackythefrost> @brisk_dacat Sephiroth Clones
[1:18:00] <PirateMike_> @LoneFonte ah gotcha thanks
[1:18:01] <Oxybe> i wonder what her weapons will unlock thou. main game guys unlocked some neat shit.
[1:18:01] <%maskedsongbird> Is there any news for how far off Part 2 is, now that I'm thinking about it?
[1:18:02] <ComicReliefHero> @ComicReliefHero It might be lost on you, but expansions weren't always this way.
[1:18:04] <%valriot> Kalm
[1:18:06] <%Monkeyweed21> p much yea
[1:18:09] <+Buzzkill983> They had to learn how to magic because Shinra won't let them have materia
[1:18:09] <%Monkeyweed21> NO KEEP IT
[1:18:11] <experience_share> I really hope they'll announce the PC version of at least base Remake at their announcements thing
[1:18:16] <SaltyAzteca> So has FF implemented CT mechanics or nah?
[1:18:16] <majindusto> Yuffies theme was ALWAYS  GREAT...You hush yourself
[1:18:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It'll probably be better once you get some more characters
[1:18:18] <macathelo> why not steal?
[1:18:19] <tolloponik> as long as they don't go the last hour of the game ever again I;ll be interested again
[1:18:20] <+ZoltanBMagnus> I'm pretty sure yuffie is like, 5
[1:18:21] <tanarath> Check anyways, Pat, there might be good shit in the attack materia
[1:18:22] <ape_hawk> methinks yuffie is designed to be more of a ranged dps
[1:18:22] <$LegendGHT> put her tank stance on
[1:18:25] <+LittleBigQuebec> I guess it might matter if you spend time in melee with element weapon @PatStaresAt
[1:18:28] <%jackythefrost> @sporeian94 At this point in time shes 16
[1:18:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why would you ever take off scan. Need to scan fast
[1:18:42] <Albedo28> that is amusing to think that princess all elemental attacks here wants materia so bad
[1:18:55] <%sporeian94> @jackythefrost There is no way that's a 16 year old. She acts and looks like an 11 year old
[1:18:58] <+Kazekyou> Where's Trick Attack? LUL
[1:19:03] <falyden> it's the giant pizza in the sky
[1:19:06] <SaltyAzteca> Also I get a NieR Automata vibe for some reason LUL
[1:19:08] <%coreyyotto> new area that looks like an old area
[1:19:09] <zakafiel> Hey Pat, have you seen the elden ring trailer?
[1:19:14] <%Dfreddy8> Boss bridge?
[1:19:17] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he watched the trailer this morning
[1:19:18] <%Monkeyweed21> recycled assets maybe but the sectors slums all look alike
[1:19:19] <+BIumen> oooh
[1:19:24] <%jackythefrost> @sporeian94 Welcome to anything anime where age is bullshit
[1:19:24] <@SoFarFetched> VOD will be uploaded to youtube
[1:19:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> neat
[1:19:25] <LoneFonte> All the clones
[1:19:25] <+BIumen> beardiroth
[1:19:26] <%walternatorz> was there a sale on cloaks?
[1:19:27] <yourliteraldog> Slightly
[1:19:29] <%toolofparanoia> BEARD
[1:19:30] <laserbeaming> not very good clones I guess
[1:19:33] <rekinom> @sporeian94 How many 5'5 11 year olds do you know?
[1:19:33] <Mattais88> Sepiroth with a beard?
[1:19:33] <+michingmallecho> Beardo
[1:19:33] <%asgard147> sure are alota crack addicts around here
[1:19:34] <majindusto> CHECK THE NUMBER
[1:19:34] <rReizs> SEPHIROTH WITH A BEARD
[1:19:35] <%maskedsongbird> @sporeian94 Remember though: she's technically royalty. So you've gotta factor her spoiled princess mannerisms in there.
[1:19:37] <%megadblitz> Where's gackt
[1:19:38] <ChungusQuest> This game are sick!
[1:19:40] <reonome> HE SAID IT

[1:19:43] <+EdeninShambles> Different numbers too
[1:19:46] <+michingmallecho> Progress KomodoHype
[1:19:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Nose so fuzzy
[1:19:53] <%maskedsongbird> I like how she's psyching herself up
[1:19:54] <+michingmallecho> These guys are sick
[1:19:54] <%Valdorick> Yeah, Yuffie, THEY'RE strange.
[1:19:54] <$ringabal> YOSHAAA
[1:19:55] <%solracc25> tattoo numbers
[1:19:56] <+Buzzkill983> Oh she's a big dork, I love it XD
[1:19:59] <%Ipsenscastle> fucking nothingggg
[1:20:02] <neveton> different tattoos maybe
[1:20:08] <Louie_Salmon> Just walking up to these guys is so weird
[1:20:10] <%solracc25> check the numbers
[1:20:12] <%valriot> Yuffie just ignoring the MSQ
[1:20:13] <%LaughingCatt> NOW its an old area LUL
[1:20:18] <Albedo28> Yuffie initially was a 25 year old mercenary who'd chase cloud for a bounty before changes were made for resource management IRL
[1:20:22] <joso_grando> magic pocket
[1:20:24] <%Monkeyweed21> those guys are what every SOLDIER turns into eventually right?
[1:20:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> fuck they really sold the catch on the dagger
[1:20:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> would've thought that you already learned FF7RE isnt cruel enough to lock you off something without telling you first
[1:20:27] <NewWillinium> That clone had a beard. Iwant to see Sephiroth with a full beard now
[1:20:31] <%TimetodiveLTX> that felt good!
[1:20:32] <Mattais88> Oh ths is the sector 7 dump
[1:20:37] <@SoFarFetched> shes gonna keep talking to herself geefPlz
[1:20:42] <+senfood> She sounds like me when I moved to New Jersey.
[1:20:47] <yourliteraldog> Why do all the clones have a fentanyl problem
[1:20:56] <majindusto> You've  been  repeatedly  running  past Clone  no. 11
[1:20:58] <no_stunts> i feel like such an idiot for buying ff7r on ps4 thinking it would all be on ps4
[1:20:59] <%Daxalog> Midgar smells of Sulfur
[1:21:00] <+Kaask> i talk to myself
[1:21:02] <+spartanghost004> looks like all the old secrets still exists
[1:21:02] <$Pompadourius> So is the cloak just part of her new design permanently? I assume she'll reveal her normal outfit eventually.
[1:21:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> didnt you talk to yourself all the time when you were her age?
[1:21:05] <yourliteraldog> She is also a quirky teen
[1:21:05] <+BusterRepukken> shes got nothing on Deacon talking to himself tho
[1:21:05] <%BinaryFireball> that wheel has a sad face on it
[1:21:05] <+shaidot> surprising amount of clones in the early parts of the remake
[1:21:07] <%jackythefrost> @rekinom bruh I had a full mustach when I was 12
[1:21:08] <%Mr_Pylon> She should talk like Deacon
[1:21:09] <SaltyAzteca> Coincidence, woooo
[1:21:10] <%Ynkubus_> @newwillinium like a really long white one? LUL
[1:21:10] <+michingmallecho> The clones need a hit of that sweet sweet jenova
[1:21:11] <rReizs> did you not immediately develop a spontaneous JEORSEY accent
[1:21:15] <Oxybe> She's an anime protagonist
[1:21:15] <%TimetodiveLTX> the music...
[1:21:20] <LoneFonte> when is gonna scream to herself while on a bike?
[1:21:23] <%Ipsenscastle> @SveriSageAdvice FF7R did lock you out of stuff without warning a few times
[1:21:27] <+gespenst25> Hey it's that dog.
[1:21:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> @no_stunts If you have the physical version it gives you the upgrade on ps5
[1:21:30] <ComicReliefHero> @no_stunts Don't you love it when companies swing for maximum nostalgia, maximum profits, maximum piece-meal packaging?
[1:21:40] <tolloponik> wait the gate wasn't locked guys?
[1:21:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Wot
[1:21:41] <$Pompadourius> Oh my god she doesn't fit in AT ALL next to these urban militia guys. LUL

[1:21:49] <Coystick> Cloud Days Gone
[1:21:50] <%maskedsongbird> @no_stunts You and me both. I didn't think ALL of it would be on PS4, but I would've thought the in-between stuff at least would've been.
[1:21:50] <%UvBenServed> *Barrett
[1:21:52] <+BusterRepukken> Ive been playing Days Gone on PC and Deacon might be my favorite part of the game
[1:21:56] <+spartanghost004> yes because he is two guys burgers and fires
[1:21:56] <xbb1024> No, Cloud would remain silent always

[1:31:35] <@SoFarFetched> @sjay662 Pat will upload the VOD in a few days on youtube cause it takes awhile.
[1:31:35] <+spartanghost004> Did they turn this into a mini game?

[1:33:19] <yourliteraldog> They better make minis for this
[1:33:24] <+Chronobot> PS1 models Ye
[1:33:24] <$LegendGHT> ford condor the moba
[1:33:24] <%coreyyotto> Is this just the Clan minigame from Kiwami 2?
[1:33:27] <Louie_Salmon> @celiohogane I wish they made this a mobile game instead of that BR thing
[1:33:28] <%ironohki> I recognize this music from original, but hearing this version makes me think of Final Fantasy Tactics.
[1:33:29] <artoflec> isnt it called vermilion not verminion am i in bernstein universe again oh shit
[1:33:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Literally better verminion.
[1:33:33] <%ExpressNode> I wonder if they would make bank if they made this a mobile game
[1:33:34] <%capnbeefs> Wait, this is good tho
[1:33:47] <+THOUTHPAW> i love the blocky design they went for with this
[1:33:48] <monopolyman001> this is not a massive online battle arena
[1:33:53] <ashuckel> This would be awesome on mobile
[1:33:57] <rReizs> BRING THIS TO THE GOLD SAUCER
[1:33:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> normally vermilion, but verminion because ffxiv uses minions as units
[1:34:00] <%capnbeefs> I would play this on my phone for sure
[1:34:01] <%ospreyworks> this track is great
[1:34:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, it’s Lord of Verminion.
[1:34:08] <+SeventhVice> THE MUSIC
[1:34:09] <+CelioHogane> I love that all the models on this minigame have original FF7 style.
[1:34:15] <%maskedsongbird> Oh this is so cool
[1:34:15] <yourliteraldog> They already have first solider coming out.
[1:34:20] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[1:34:20] <Mattais88> Hold the Line!
[1:34:26] <artoflec> got it okay, verminion is FFXIV but its a play on lord of vermilion
[1:34:26] <%Jekado> your deploy field is larger i think
[1:34:29] <%Valdorick> Lord of Vermillion
[1:34:38] <xbb1024> So inworld, is this like a boardgame or a Switchgame?
[1:34:39] <Louie_Salmon> This is literally in every way Clash Royale, like every single mechanic
[1:34:47] <artoflec> they spell it with one l too for some dumb reason
[1:34:57] <%Jekado> I think you can deploy futher out
[1:34:57] <%코코꾸라> no?
[1:35:01] <yourliteraldog> How mad will you guys be if First Solider is good. I would have an actual stroke
[1:35:01] <%metalicblackcherry> @PatStaresAt you can summon them futher up
[1:35:05] <@StridentSong> It's Lords of Verminion
[1:35:05] <Louie_Salmon> No autochess is a completely different thing
[1:35:05] <%Jekado> because i think the white is you deploy field
[1:35:05] <Zebroneath> You can spawn them further in
[1:35:06] <+michingmallecho> Nice
[1:35:11] <%blastazoid00> It always has been
[1:35:12] <%Paperware> no, not really
[1:35:12] <Saltmeisterr> hullo no pats
[1:35:17] <%maskedsongbird> Wait, are you playing as the Shinra invaders taking down the condor?
[1:35:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> no?
[1:35:22] <%VHGS> Giga rushdown is probably still the strat I guess
[1:35:23] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt What's your opinion on the plot ghosts?
[1:35:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> we can tell
[1:35:26] <yourliteraldog> Same
[1:35:27] <%ExpressNode> Those bird sounds feel like I've heard that specific sound from another game but can't but my finger on it
[1:35:30] <+Kaask> is this just verminion
[1:35:31] <@StridentSong> Pat, you can summon them up to the line on the field
[1:35:31] <Link232> It's that one mobile game, Fort Royale or something?
[1:35:33] <%solracc25> tower Offense
[1:35:33] <iosephe> chess, but auto
[1:35:36] <reonome> boomer pat
[1:35:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, it’s Lord of Vermillion.
[1:35:39] <rReizs> yeah the spawn line moves forward the more your units move up
[1:35:41] <%Paperware> fair enough
[1:35:43] <Srthunda> that is good enough to count
[1:35:44] <%Daxalog> Clash Royale
[1:35:44] <majindusto> I hear the First Soldier  is actually kinda Good from people  who played the Beta
[1:35:45] <JaceDarkstar> this looks like the clash royal gor i think
[1:35:48] <xeros720> yeah, there's a lot of these, usually just 2d or something
[1:35:50] <Saltmeisterr> CHAT WTF IS THIS?
[1:35:50] <ToneBacas> no that's FF13 Kappa
[1:35:53] <+Chex868> wtf is this
[1:35:53] <+CelioHogane> By that logic, you never play on RTs...
[1:35:54] <+Arek_1> SourPls
[1:35:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can summon up to the blue line
[1:36:00] <cherrycottontail> No this is that game in the basement of the gold saucer in ff14
[1:36:02] <Astrophizz> or Yakuza 6 gang minigame
[1:36:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Rad
[1:36:12] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt Have you noticed the soldier models are like the PS1 models
[1:36:14] <%heartlesshealer> so this is that bird nest minigame, but as the attackers?
[1:36:15] <mattynezz> Why does Pat keep moving back to deploy units?
[1:36:15] <$LightningLynx89> I like how they're HD PS1 models as the figures
[1:36:19] <%ironohki> ASS
[1:36:20] <DemonioB> comming soon to mobile
[1:36:21] <Louie_Salmon> Well, wish I had a PS5 so I could play this
[1:36:25] <%Daxalog> I kinda wish this was in the PS1 artstyle. ANd had ps1 sound effects
[1:36:25] <%Valdorick> Woooooooaw
[1:36:25] <ape_hawk> damn, yuffie
[1:36:26] <pmoneydarthswagg> Pat, remember that Barret's group is a splinter of the main avalanche that got kicked out for being too extreme, so it's not like these guys aren't blowing up reactors or anything.
[1:36:26] <mattynezz> He must see there's no indicators
[1:36:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Just got done playing some PSO2:NG and BOY SEGA REALLY SCREWED THE POOCH. BACK TO XIV I GO/

[2:06:53] <Vaunno> DESTROYED
[2:06:55] <%maskedsongbird> @scarman125 To be fair, I never found Yuffie quite as annoying as Selphie in FF8. Yuffie is downright fun and enjoyable in comparison.
[2:06:55] <SkinnyRite> whatashame
[2:06:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Then try circle strafing to stay in the Gap maybe?

[2:07:06] <+TheBitingIrish> He did
[2:07:09] <%asgard147> He did clutch the fight out
[2:07:11] <beefomkers> I hate this annoying ten year old
[2:07:12] <neosman5587> Is this on hard mode?
[2:07:13] <+tigerfang86> Max is god of FF7

[2:07:14] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah
[2:07:14] <ToneBacas> chat never lies Kappa
[2:07:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeah he did it actually 2nx try
[2:07:15] <%beepbeepbopbop> True
[2:07:16] <%metalicblackcherry> I watched two people do it one of which was Max
[2:07:16] <@PeachSaliva> Max is pretty awesome tho
[2:07:16] <%patriotrenegade> yeah, he does
[2:07:17] <Vaunno> he did in 2? tries
[2:07:18] <%solracc25> doesn't count
[2:07:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @SoFarFetched YOU FOOL HE HAS 70 ALTERNATE ACCOUNTS
[2:07:21] <%echobee_tv> @sporeian94 sssshhhhh
[2:07:21] <rekinom> Max is my uncle who works for nintendo
[2:07:21] <+SilverDevilfish> Simps... Max did it
[2:07:22] <+Arek_1> Parry is an armored dodge. You'll still take some damage. But maybe may low-profile it.
[2:07:22] <@SoFarFetched> @sporeian94 no its too late,someone told him Max did it solo so now PAT has to do it on solo.
[2:07:23] <Blank9> simpsons did it
[2:07:24] <Albedo28> the circuitous lasers go faster than he can run
[2:07:25] <+EdeninShambles> He did it in three attempts
[2:07:26] <%NateyBeak> max fixed the broken lamp
[2:07:26] <%maskedsongbird> Haven't watched a Max stream, so I cannot comment.
[2:07:26] <johnatella> I think he had the barrier in perfect guard on.
[2:07:26] <%Jeemukun> Max is also good at video games psaSmug
[2:07:27] <%Caped_Eggy> He's just a better human being in general
[2:07:28] <+Stormzcales_Lair> naww, you would've done it if you got that last LB
[2:07:30] <@SoFarFetched> @Monkeyweed21 god please I hope not.
[2:07:30] <SkinnyRite> Max is the simpsons of the zaibatsu
[2:07:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> i wouldnt be surprised if he did bash his head against this wall until he beat it
[2:07:30] <%Ipsenscastle> Max is an alpha gamer though
[2:07:31] <%Valdorick> @sporeian94 Sounds like the coward's way out to Pat.
[2:07:31] <Garnetguy98> Max is that dude
[2:07:31] <frostyjay3> DUEL 8 LET'S ROCK
[2:07:32] <Louie_Salmon> He's pretty good at video games
[2:07:33] <%walternatorz> SIMPSONS DID IT
[2:07:34] <neosman5587> yes pat max did it
[2:07:35] <SirDogBear> Max Power PogChamp
[2:07:35] <Albedo28> he needs to be away or risk eating two hits
[2:07:37] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean just grow hair Max did it :)
[2:07:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> Yea max did that too
[2:07:38] <+ScrapKingKeita> You and Max do overlap a lot of games, tbf
[2:07:40] <UnImprest> course he did, its ff7
[2:07:42] <Strider222> max is superior gamer
[2:07:42] <%ospreyworks> @sofarfetched you have my sympathy
[2:07:43] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i soloed it too he's not hard once you figure him out
[2:07:47] <feralspidey> "wait, you mean livestreamers play trendy games? no way!!!!"
[2:07:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Substitution jutsu
[2:07:50] <Garnetguy98> He did a diago parry
[2:07:50] <majindusto> HE LITERALLY DID IT. NO LIES
[2:07:51] <awalbaru> Actually strategy PogChamp
[2:07:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> He actually dodged the mines that time PogChamp
[2:07:54] <%TheLemuroid> Substitution jutsu
[2:07:55] <frostyjay3> I think he just got lucky and played it safe
[2:07:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Omfg it substitue
[2:07:59] <BarujaraciGaming> it looks like you're going to need to use all of your spacial reasoning skills for curcuitous bolts. if you're too close they'll hit you so you need to go to the other side of the arena so there's distance cuz they stop at a certain distance
[2:08:00] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt I mean it. He totally beat it and he beat in the exact same part of the story that you fighting it at right now
[2:08:02] <%sporeian94> Pat I don't mean to alarm you, but the boss fight on youtube is 3 minutes
[2:08:03] <Blank9> parry materia canceling out all your attacks made tifa so much fun
[2:08:06] <+TheBitingIrish> cmon fingers, work
[2:08:10] <%asgard147> It's a dodge
[2:08:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Diego Did it
[2:08:22] <jorniev> complaining to chat? max did it
[2:08:25] <Lucreto> its very much possible dont forget if you block for judgement bolt that helps alot
[2:08:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt put it on a shortcut
[2:08:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I cant lie, I purposely didnt watch Max cause I want to interact and chat. I hate the sub only chat and I like Pats take on this series. THIS series lol
[2:08:33] <%Robot_Nixon_> Max did it, soul level 1 too
[2:08:35] <%coreyyotto> Probably best used as a shortcut
[2:08:44] <%asgard147> Might help with that spining attack?
[2:08:54] <%solracc25> shadow clone
[2:08:54] <Albedo28> big stagger gain! Yeah!

[2:24:48] <ashuckel> why is this happenign with yuffie and not tifda
[2:24:49] <+spartanghost004> I honestly think it is a bot
[2:24:49] <%echobee_tv> Y'all mods are fantastic, keep it up.
[2:24:50] <%mikeriffic> I mean she is cute but i feel she needs to be protected more then be attracted to
[2:24:51] <%heyitsbrian> 6 accounts?!  they had a dumb plan
[2:24:52] <tanarath> She's cute, but she's YOUNG
[2:24:52] <Mattais88> You'd think Tifa and her huge boobs would do it
[2:24:53] <%Arancet> why would he be so dedicated to being a creep? so much effort...
[2:24:53] <Pookiedaexzile> 20 years of horny, plus a horny revolution of irony based horrible shit

[2:24:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> same
[2:24:59] <bakkatohri> @Monkeyweed21 Oh, okay. Thanks.
[2:25:00] <+Wemf> Don’t blame it on yuffie
[2:25:00] <ChungusQuest> Humanity was not ready for floppy socks.
[2:25:00] <%Cykron> People are obsessed with their waifus
[2:25:01] <tolloponik> wired, I hated yuffie growing up so I don't see the appeal
[2:25:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> LMAO
[2:25:04] <%Deft_Thought> She looks like a child
[2:25:05] <%justcallmebobplease> AND JESSIE
[2:25:06] <Vaunno> unironically "7 alternate accounts" mf
[2:25:06] <alroy900> fucking wierdos....
[2:25:07] <%NateyBeak> and Wedge;;;~~
[2:25:07] <WreckItRaz> imagine being so desperate and determined to just get that off your chest for an audience
[2:25:07] <%Jekado> i like the hoodie tho
[2:25:07] <+spartanghost004> same here
[2:25:07] <Albedo28> Isn't it nice to be old sometimes?
[2:25:10] <%ospreyworks> I'm sure this guy would have popped up no matter what
[2:25:10] <%justcallmebobplease> Don't forget DRAMATHIRST
[2:25:11] <+red_cuppa> rip hints
[2:25:13] <%JoshManVGH> But why the desperation to share the thirst?
[2:25:14] <%Monkeyweed21> she is a stupid child
[2:25:15] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[2:25:16] <%Jekado> i want to get the hoodie i hope they make it.
[2:25:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I was thirsty for Tifa fam. Like man

[2:25:30] <SkinnyRite> @eanscrale To get a react. Bet the guy is a follower and is using burners to get people talking about them.
[2:25:31] <%justcallmebobplease> And Scarlett, for people that wanna be stepped on
[2:25:32] <%JoshManVGH> That man is a turtle!
[2:25:33] <Albedo28> The hoodie is not my jam, but then again, I've never been a fan of moogles
[2:25:33] <yourliteraldog> A DOMMY MOMMY
[2:25:36] <+THOUTHPAW> a lot of that type of person gets off on being able to force people to have to engage with it
[2:25:37] <atema128> Isn’t Yuffie like a teenager? Aerith and Tifa are literally right there and much cooler.
[2:25:41] <+cascadepersona> Yuffie is portrayed so well. She's "annoying" but really charming
[2:25:42] <%HiroTSK5> The Hints are a Key item in your Menu
[2:25:43] <frostyjay3> It's real scary and creepy that people say the nastiest shit for Yuffie
[2:25:43] <mutantlunchbox1> wedge do be dummy thicc tho
[2:25:44] <%TheLemuroid> Anything less than 25 feels like child to me now
[2:25:45] <SkinnyRite> Easiest to do with child characters
[2:25:47] <+IxDomxI> @PatStaresAt you can read these hints in your inventory in the key items tab if you dont wanna keep running back to him
[2:25:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> i appreciate that the hoodie is hiding the full design for part 2

[2:29:14] <Garnetguy98> I completely agree

[2:29:51] <Broken_Sonex> Let's be real, the FF7 plot is fucking stupid
[2:29:56] <%maskedsongbird> Aren't pretty much all of the best Final Fantasy games character-driven ensembles?
[2:29:57] <%shieldecho> ...you cannot pet psaJpeg and i am sad
[2:29:59] <wohdin> i like how his name is just “merc” according to her
[2:30:00] <%saiyanblitz> @skinnyrite dang your right her too
[2:30:03] <%BigCoffee> ff7 was always about the stupid minigames that we all love
[2:30:09] <ape_hawk> STAMP LORE

[2:30:12] <monopolyman001> stamp PogChamp
[2:30:13] <+Linconlord> that's the same minigame from sneaking out of aerith's house right?
[2:30:14] <%Valdorick> So... Did Marle sneak behind you, or do a full ass silent leap over the railing?

[2:30:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's teaching cats?
[2:30:21] <+RaveBV> I feel like that's more to do with padding this DLC out to feel longer and less like backtracing.
[2:30:21] <%beepbeepbopbop> I am always amazed that FF7R is an Unreal game.

[2:31:22] <%condemned_15> gongaga, kupo
[2:31:23] <+michingmallecho> FF7 essentially boils down to...aliens.
[2:31:23] <DrGasMax> I love when the game does stuff like this, I love the world building of FF7 so much and I wish they would do way more
[2:31:23] <wohdin> SHINRA PROPAGANDA

[2:33:54] <Psyramics> Kyrie was guest designed by known Marie stan Mr. Feel
[2:33:55] <%ExpressNode> Really because she came out like 10 years ago surely the styles have changed a bit

[2:44:29] <Vaunno> maybe hecs here on business? or maybe the trains stopped bc of the bombings
[2:44:41] <%rDAKODAc> Has Pat tried to go into the bar yet?
[2:44:52] <monopolyman001> no one remembers fort condor tooshiSad
[2:44:55] <%sporeian94> The minigame in OG FF7 sucked tbh
[2:45:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There was a giant bird
[2:45:06] <%maskedsongbird> @MasterTonberry23 Right? He's a middle manager, not an executive. Means he gets paid slightly better than the average grunt, but not enough to live too well.
[2:45:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like Paige's NO!
[2:45:09] <jorniev> I'm going to assume pat already had found wedge cause it was crazy to me how he ignored him
[2:45:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Omg now you're killing the birds doodSad
[2:45:17] <feralspidey> they turned it into an ingame mobile game
[2:45:25] <MasterTonberry23> fort condor was a good idea with awful, AWFUL execution
[2:45:33] <%YakumoYomi> They could seriously make this its own game
[2:45:36] <Coystick> Rip fast fuck ass
[2:45:36] <dan_g_v> guyyys
[2:45:37] <horse_disguised_as_horse> It looks ok
[2:45:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> This Fort Condor minigame feels like the ads I see for Raid Shadow Legends.
[2:45:38] <yourliteraldog> Red FUCKS
[2:45:38] <arkv01> red most definitely goes to town on ass
[2:45:40] <+Qsmash_> it fucks ass, huh?
[2:45:49] <Theo_Marks> wait hold on did they put in auto chess into ff7??
[2:45:51] <horse_disguised_as_horse> They dunk on him good
[2:45:52] <%capnbeefs> BEAT THIS LOVING FATHER INTO THE DIRT!!!!!
[2:45:52] <%Robot_Nixon_> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:45:55] <dan_g_v> sounds. bad
[2:45:55] <Vaunno> LULW
[2:45:57] <SkinnyRite> Well Paige is a Redhead
[2:45:59] <MasterTonberry23> @Too_Much_Nukie how dare you. this actually looks fun
[2:46:02] <xeros720> what interesting is the color wheel doesn't affect their inherent values/role
[2:46:02] <Dabrikishaw> Okay, seriously, this reminds me more of Dragon Ball Heroes than it does Triple Triad or Gwent
[2:46:04] <tattleworm> red fucks ass, which is why hojo's experiment with aerith ultimately failed
[2:46:05] <yourliteraldog> Red's ROCKET
[2:46:17] <Vaunno> KEKW
[2:46:19] <MasterTonberry23> @tattleworm heyoooo
[2:46:19] <xeros720> so the blue units are built like tanks, the green ones are ranged, and the melee ones are high damage, regardless
[2:46:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @MasterTonberry23 I mean, Raid Shadow Legends ADS look fun too. They don't show real gameplay loops.
[2:46:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Remeber kids, Being good to your daughter erases away all evil you had hand in
[2:46:30] <MasterTonberry23> @tattleworm also i think i read that fanfic the other day
[2:46:37] <yourliteraldog> @tattleworm you can't get someones butt prego
[2:46:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mobile game ads usually look fun. Fun or horny. Sometimes both.
[2:46:58] <Vaunno> often neither
[2:47:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> @yourliteraldog Through Christ all things are possible.
[2:47:17] <Basch71> I like how the units look like high res'd versions of the original ff7 models
[2:47:21] <%AbnormalVoid> 1337

[2:50:17] <rReizs> this is when ripley came on maxs stream
[2:50:17] <Pookiedaexzile> That was 100 percent sincere, and in game he really did let her win,

[2:50:20] <%asgard147> limesLUL limesLUL limesLUL
[2:50:23] <%Garthunox> so thats how you beat woolie in guilty gear
[2:50:24] <Coystick> Why is she like this
[2:50:31] <agadejobi> You think you'd be used to how weird people cn be on the internet
[2:50:32] <%sporeian94> But also isn't letting the child win stunting their development by not learning sometimes you lose because you're not good causing the positive feedback loop to the point where losing in later life if devestating
[2:50:32] <tanarath> Pat, were you letting Chadley win?
[2:50:32] <%Ascethetic> so thats how you play Guilty Gear Kappa
[2:50:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Middle Manager did not even use 10% of his power
[2:50:41] <%asgard147> Go to the bar Pat
[2:50:44] <agadejobi> But there's always another layer of depravity to dig through
[2:50:45] <johnatella> What happens when you got to Seventh Heaven???🤔🤔🤔🤔
[2:50:49] <%Caped_Eggy> Let them win a couple of games and crush them so hard they stop playing
[2:50:52] <MasterTonberry23> @agadejobi just when you think you are, it gets weirder

[2:51:23] <SkinnyRite> NUHUH
[2:51:26] <%AbnormalVoid> oh thank god
[2:51:26] <blackjack8182> Hi Yuri
[2:51:35] <%maskedsongbird> So do moogles not exist as anything other than mascot characters in FF7's world (robots and Gold Saucer games and such)? I honestly don't remember.
[2:51:35] <iosephe> BEAT HIS ASS
[2:51:37] <%saiyanblitz> Johnny I thought Cloud told you to get the fuck out of sector seven
[2:51:38] <MasterTonberry23> dude keeps his shirt open so he can say "hey you looking at my abs?"
[2:51:42] <agadejobi> What is the Fort Condor price anyway?
[2:51:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Johnny is a gamer
[2:51:45] <+spartanghost004> it will be a child
[2:51:45] <%Caped_Eggy> Looks bad
[2:51:46] <frostyjay3> It's Spider-Man
[2:51:46] <Pookiedaexzile> If you're really good at a game, you can force a close game or tie. That is how the true older/better gamers take care of our students on P2 side
[2:51:46] <agadejobi> prize
[2:51:47] <%solracc25> Isn't he banned from sector 7?
[2:51:47] <+tigerfang86> now RUIN HIM INSTANTLY
[2:51:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Demolish his asshole
[2:51:48] <Albedo28> Johnny is the shadow broker. *Yes I did read it incorrectly*
[2:51:51] <%condemned_15> skree
[2:51:52] <%Robot_Nixon_> @Psyramics isn't this Yuri? or did they change it up for the DLC
[2:51:53] <+Buzzkill983> I wonder who the Grandmaster will be?
[2:51:53] <%RAWPowerStudios> Are the dudes from Dirge of Cerberus in this?
[2:51:54] <%asgard147> no red
[2:51:56] <+red_cuppa> money and materia
[2:52:00] <%Monkeyweed21> STEAL HIS LUNCH MONEY
[2:52:02] <shabop> kill him
[2:52:04] <%Valdorick> He spent more money down at the Games Workshop.
[2:52:05] <Albedo28> dude, what if the champ is the middle manager's daughter?
[2:52:06] <+spartanghost004> Beat him for it
[2:52:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> yeah but he's Johnny so ironmouseSHRUG
[2:52:09] <xeros720> his outposts will do a bunch of damage
[2:52:10] <Coystick> I wonder if this is her "set" outfit or if she'll wear her old gear in FFR72?
[2:52:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[2:52:14] <AllenDeadman> well well well
[2:52:16] <+NiktenKing> ????
[2:52:17] <Psyramics> @Robot_Nixon_ It doesn't sound like Yuri at all
[2:52:18] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh johnny's gonna kick ass

[2:52:22] <+fetrigon> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:52:25] <frostyjay3> @Robot_Nixon_ It's still Yuri. He's just talented as hell

[2:52:29] <MasterTonberry23> your eyes starting to go pat? LUL
[2:52:33] <rReizs> oh got pat is developing colour confusion
[2:52:35] <%solracc25> isn't Johnny banned from sec 7?
[2:52:42] <SaltyAzteca> Johnny?!
[2:52:49] <MasterTonberry23> he was only banned a little
[2:52:52] <%asgard147> John Knee?
[2:52:57] <+spartanghost004> oh right he died
[2:53:01] <%sporeian94> He's trying to get scraps before heading out
[2:53:01] <agadejobi> It was a one week ban
[2:53:02] <%coreyyotto> John Fantasy
[2:53:02] <monopolyman001> probably why he was hiding
[2:53:03] <yourliteraldog> He was kicked out
[2:53:04] <Coystick> S P E E D
[2:53:04] <%JoshManVGH> Man, I hope Woolie is feeling better and having a blast with this.
[2:53:06] <DrGasMax> Johnny often does dumb things that could go very bad for him
[2:53:07] <%Valdorick> Also, when is this taking place? He might have just gotten his life threatened by Cloud
[2:53:11] <%maskedsongbird> @Valdorick Man, don't even joke about that. I just went to my local game store yesterday and thought about buying some starter stuff to get into the 40k hobby, then I saw the price tags. :(
[2:53:14] <xeros720> yeah, sorcerer board 1 seems like a trap
[2:53:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're gonna lose.
[2:53:20] <%RyTYoung> yup
[2:53:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> I need to spend these points on something nyannSadge
[2:53:24] <MasterTonberry23> @JoshManVGH somethign happening with woolie?
[2:53:34] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick Crack is cheaper.
[2:53:41] <%Shady_Squid> @JoshManVGH this is 100% some woolie shit
[2:53:42] <+red_cuppa> @Valdorick after the sector 5 plate gets blown up
[2:53:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wars are won before the first shot is ever fired Pat.
[2:53:56] <%maskedsongbird> @Valdorick Lol, that's exactly what I said when I was there.
[2:54:00] <+Slydoc2341> yea 40k is for people with a lot of extra income
[2:54:04] <Wolfstriker121> this is not good
[2:54:05] <%sporeian94> that was his materia magic
[2:54:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Murder.exe Online
[2:54:10] <tattleworm> that was his fire spell mostly
[2:54:13] <%Daxalog> Middle is a death zone
[2:54:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @MasterTonberry23 His spine is escaping from his mortal flesh
[2:54:16] <Albedo28> he used materia, mhm
[2:54:16] <%Daxalog> Hog the corners
[2:54:20] <SaltyAzteca> While you were out gathering materia I was studying the board.
[2:54:24] <xeros720> yeah, his board gives him 3
[2:54:25] <agadejobi> It's called 40k, because that's how much you gotta spend to be in it
[2:54:30] <%maskedsongbird> @Slydoc2341 It sucks because I really like the IP, and I like TTS and reading the official 40k novels.
[2:54:33] <%ExpressNode> So I just brought my OG Xbox one from my closet and fuck is that thing huge. Bigger than my Series X
[2:54:41] <Albedo28> all his materia is used now
[2:54:47] <%Jekado> I just want Darktide!
[2:54:47] <%maskedsongbird> But I can't afford the actual hobby or to play the game.
[2:54:49] <%asgard147> and he's ALREADY used them all
[2:54:50] <agadejobi> This isn't just your average nerd material
[2:54:54] <agadejobi> This is for nerds with MONEY
[2:55:04] <Wolfstriker121> the comeback
[2:55:09] <%maskedsongbird> YUP
[2:55:13] <+Slydoc2341> yea the lore in 40k is amazing but fuck how much the tabletop is to play
[2:55:22] <%Valdorick> You out lasted his magic bullshit
[2:55:34] <%Jekado> could be worst you could want units from FORGEWORLD
[2:55:34] <xeros720> damn, lots of range seems to be the way to go
[2:55:34] <rekinom> How are you liking Warhammer pet?
[2:55:40] <%maskedsongbird> @Slydoc2341 Hell, even just buying miniatures to paint and put on the shelf for display is expensive as fuck.
[2:55:40] <SaltyAzteca> Pat going whole hog
[2:55:46] <agadejobi> Insulin or 40k, dorks, what's it gonna be
[2:55:47] <+Arek_1> SourPls
[2:55:55] <Ephexos101> cute tail
[2:55:55] <rReizs> a manta is $2000+ CANADIAN
[2:55:56] <frostyjay3> @ExpressNode That first run XBONE model was large for no real reason lmao. I remember growing up and having the hardest time trying to put that thing in any entertainment center I had
[2:56:03] <Wolfstriker121> some 40k items was sold for a grand before ?  or that was bs?
[2:56:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is now taunting crazy talk.
[2:56:10] <Wolfstriker121> because i heard stories
[2:56:14] <Hellarussian> take that Johnny
[2:56:15] <SaltyAzteca> Game set and match
[2:56:16] <+Slydoc2341> hell it would probably be cheaper to be a drug addict then to play 40k
[2:56:17] <%AbnormalVoid> it's only Johnny after all
[2:56:18] <%Valdorick> @agadejobi GUESS I'M GOING INTO COMA TONIGHT FOR PAPA NURGLE

[2:58:45] <frostyjay3> If you talk to her before you hit rank 2 Jessie just tells you off
[2:58:53] <+red_cuppa> he just didnt talk to her before he was good enough to challenge her so the line doesn't really make sense
[2:58:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> @raging_1nf3rno "the materia is humming..."
[2:58:57] <%bevyrage> wait is that a starting ATB of 6!?
[2:59:01] <+RaveBV> @monopolyman001 There's a cutscene before this one.
[2:59:01] <%genepark> Jessie tells yuffie to leave her alone earlier
[2:59:06] <monopolyman001> oh i see./
[2:59:09] <+Arek_1> Pat's gained an inkling of QA aura. Breaking progression. LUL
[2:59:09] <SaltyAzteca> @majindusto The ghosts are being responsible LUL
[2:59:15] <+RaveBV> This minigame broke the flag chain and happened before it.
[2:59:22] <%ExpressNode> @frostyjay3 I just had a crazy idea,. what if I stick my copy of Cyberpunk 2077 version 1.0 and see how it runs
[2:59:27] <%Daxalog> Also your Turrets on this board are weaker
[2:59:28] <+RaveBV> Hope that doesn't cause problems later for pat.
[2:59:41] <Wolfstriker121> so for the lore wise people ..so the ff7 original ending was legit the bad ending ? i mean minus the movies and such
[2:59:49] <frostyjay3> @ExpressNode That no shit might blow up your console lmaoooo
[2:59:49] <+RaveBV> would suck if he can't progress or some shit because of this lmao
[2:59:53] <+tigerfang86> it'

[3:00:10] <Albedo28> Johnny was stronger than you too, I feel every new board is better than yours
[3:00:19] <%Rumbutt> The hornier you are the better you are at Fort Condor
[3:00:26] <+tigerfang86> Yeah DO IT
[3:00:30] <%genepark> LUL
[3:00:30] <MasterTonberry23> its not the strength of the board its how you use it
[3:00:38] <%sporeian94> Don't forget to use your spells pat
[3:00:41] <+tigerfang86> @Rumbutt then why was Johnny so weak???
[3:00:42] <+Arek_1> @ChrisPlaysThing Powerful.
[3:00:52] <wohdin> @wolfstriker121 not exactly… i mean the original ending was very open-ended and we don’t know enough about the remake timeline to say anything concrete about it
[3:00:56] <Vermillion129> @Wolfstriker121 The writer said ending of FF7 og is a world devoid of human
[3:01:13] <quipquest1> Yeah, kill those endangered birds!
[3:01:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> The writer for THIS game mind you.
[3:01:28] <SaltyAzteca> PAT HAS ADVANTAGE
[3:01:29] <%Nekros4442> @Vermillion129 I mean, it's alluded to cus of the scene with doggo near at the end
[3:01:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not the writers for FF7.
[3:01:45] <Saltmeisterr> wait a second is this fucking clash of clans?
[3:02:05] <KyJackshot> What is this?
[3:02:21] <xeros720> if anything it's closer to that other one
[3:02:23] <xeros720> clash of kings?
[3:02:26] <%Nekros4442> Yes, this is a mobile game that Squenix ripped into the game
[3:02:26] <$ringabal> PAT NO LONGER HAS ADVANTAGE
[3:02:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder that Nomura isn't actually a good source of FF7 lore because he was a character designer and most of what he knows is either secondhand or directly related to characters.
[3:02:31] <Wolfstriker121> ohhh no
[3:02:34] <%genepark> Fort condor. They turned an og story mission into this games gwent
[3:02:35] <TheAntiNihilist> He didn't  beat this last night?
[3:02:40] <%Caped_Eggy> But hwy?
[3:02:49] <wohdin> tfw zoomers in chat don’t know about fort condor
[3:03:01] <xeros720> "clash royale"
[3:03:01] <%genepark> I wonder if there will be a real fort condor mission in ff7 remake 2
[3:03:04] <Wolfstriker121> will you will still since you have land advantage if the time runs out"?
[3:03:04] <n3xus_nitro> 40 seconds NotLikeThis
[3:03:08] <%Rumbutt> @tigerfang86 because his Johnny-ness counteracted the power of his horny
[3:03:12] <AllenDeadman> oh shit
[3:03:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean there's a lot of people who aren't young but just never played OG FF7.

[3:03:29] <%genepark> Yep I’m an old. I played this shit in Japanese too so I had no idea
[3:03:29] <%ExpressNode> They should do online matches with it
[3:03:42] <%genepark> Online would be dope
[3:03:46] <monopolyman001> i like how the monster units are the same from the original ff7
[3:03:48] <%maskedsongbird> I just went to go to the restroom a few minutes ago. What'd I miss?

[3:17:12] <+ScatterCatt> Is that a different voice actor for Roche? He sounds different to me.
[3:17:13] <%Quigsies> yes there is
[3:17:14] <%maskedsongbird> Roche is the best. And also is probably a super lonely dude.
[3:17:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> he will sacrifice himself to save areith
[3:17:14] <Dabrikishaw> Roche is great for what he adds
[3:17:16] <+yoshkosh20> love that douchebag.

[3:23:10] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat I can't find anything that confirms Shootie HG (lead vocals in Devils Never Cry) made a song for this, but he did compose 2 songs for FFXIII-2, so there is a professional relationship established.
[3:23:12] <AllenDeadman> weren't these weak to ice in the base game?
[3:23:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ilpeggiore_ It's pretty good so far! Pat's doing side content mostly at the moment

[3:29:08] <Vaunno> @sporeian94 yes
[3:29:12] <$ringabal> YOU CANNOT KILL ME, I AM A TURTLE

[3:29:28] <+Arek_1> @ringabal LUL
[3:29:38] <%ospreyworks> here's hoping I live to see Rosso the Crimson in remake
[3:29:40] <buthidaebomb> thats ironic thats the same nickname I have for the wife....old snapper
[3:29:42] <MasterTonberry23> @randomahole no one knows, the speculation is 2 more parts to make it a trilogy
[3:29:54] <tralfamad0re> lmao
[3:29:54] <$ringabal> MMMMMMMMM WOULDNT WANNA MESS WITH THAT
[3:29:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> F
[3:29:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> Damn. What ARE Cid,Vincent and Cait Sith gunna play like?
[3:29:58] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[3:30:01] <crocboyz> cmon
[3:30:02] <mutantlunchbox1> f
[3:30:05] <SkinnyRite> what a shame
[3:30:05] <SaltyAzteca> What a shame
[3:30:06] <AllenDeadman> well...
[3:30:08] <%capnbeefs> spinning around at the speed of sound!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:30:08] <+CelioHogane> @MasterTonberry23 i personally think it might be between 4 and 5...
[3:30:13] <majindusto> SPIN 2 WIN MOTHERFUCKER
[3:30:13] <+fetrigon> F
[3:30:15] <%ShogunNoonto> Is happy turtle a drink
[3:30:18] <%Monkeyweed21> what a shame
[3:30:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Three parts would feel fitting too, considering the original FF7 had 3 disks
[3:30:21] <blackjack8182> What a shame
[3:30:21] <%Torus1025> How's it feel to finally be the one on the receiving end of the boomerang?
[3:30:24] <Albedo28> I want vincent to just be a 3rd person shooter with terrible controls. For old times sake
[3:30:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Well you took off teh HP up
[3:30:28] <MasterTonberry23> @CelioHogane we'll just have to wait and see
[3:30:30] <$Faustgesicht> Happy Turtle is a bar
[3:30:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's right, what are Cid and Vincent going to play like?
[3:30:35] <rReizs> anakin should have tried spinning against obi wan
[3:30:37] <%maskedsongbird> Do you think that the VAs are going to pronounce Cait Sith's name correctly? That would be impressive.
[3:30:37] <%shieldecho> psaSkelmo
[3:30:39] <+GingerStrawhat> @StrawberryPantsu I want vincent to play like a slightly better version of DOC, not good but slightly less terrible
[3:30:43] <randomahole> @mastertonberry23 idk man, Midgar was less than half of disc 1. Plus it's the KH guy heading this, he stretches stuff out
[3:30:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> Theres going to be seven parts
[3:31:02] <wolfen091> Vincent will probably play similar to promptos gun play in ffxv
[3:31:17] <%JoshManVGH> Huh!
[3:31:20] <johnatella> The duration it stays out.
[3:31:21] <%Torus1025> Roundtrip lasts long
[3:31:22] <Albedo28> more elemental ninjutsu time
[3:31:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> Pretty much.
[3:31:23] <ShinMaddrox> yes
[3:31:24] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:31:26] <Sp3ctre48> yeah
[3:31:27] <AllenDeadman> yeah I think so
[3:31:27] <%JoshManVGH> More time for mudra
[3:31:36] <+CelioHogane> I mean, let's be honest, we don't even know of the Yuffie DLC is going to be the only expansion of Remake 1.
[3:31:50] <Mattais88> Cid will play like a dynasty warriors character
[3:31:58] <+GingerStrawhat> I think they confirmed that this is the only DLC
[3:31:58] <Uselesswhitenoise> seven parts for the FF7
[3:32:04] <+THOUTHPAW> i didnt mind them padding out the midgar section more for part 1 bc it was fun to explore but i hope the latter parts pick up the pace a little
[3:32:05] <+TheBitingIrish> I hope Cid gets one
[3:32:06] <frostyjay3> @CanadianAnimatorGuy I feel like Cid will be a fun Dragoon in this battle system, but I expect him to be a bit heavy. Vincent will be a great up close brawler with mid range gunplay. Those are just my guesses
[3:32:10] <Uselesswhitenoise> screenshot my spoilers when im right
[3:32:10] <ShinMaddrox> Could throw Vincent in there
[3:32:11] <%Valdorick> Red 13's crazy day out
[3:32:14] <+gespenst25> Cid, wife beating sim 2022
[3:32:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Like I remember them saying not to expect anything more after this one
[3:32:17] <%Treuan> I'd be down for a Cait dlc
[3:32:17] <$StrawberryPantsu> DLC where Vincent is a Turk
[3:32:17] <%barrakuta371> Capt Sith Dlc when?
[3:32:18] <MasterTonberry23> they could do a cid dlc where we see what he was doing in rocket town before he joined up
[3:32:23] <AllenDeadman> Vincent DLC where you just stay in the shame coffin
[3:32:26] <ape_hawk> a cid dlc where you spend most of the time emotionally belittling his wife
[3:32:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> RED XIII DLC PLEEEEASE
[3:32:27] <%0oki> yeah like a dlc for vincent hanging out in his coffin
[3:32:28] <slimslimjim88> Roche dlc GlitchNRG
[3:32:29] <tolloponik> no Never
[3:32:30] <umbraawitch> i wonder what ff game they're gonna milk next
[3:32:30] <Albedo28> Vincent gets one where he's just inside the coffin
[3:32:30] <+tigerfang86> he IS
[3:32:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> I mean he was
[3:32:33] <%shieldecho> Vincent just chilling in a coffin. That's it, that's the DLC
[3:32:34] <XeroSigmaPrime> Or maybe, TURN CID UP!
[3:32:34] <animeshaquilleoneil> They absolutely will.
[3:32:36] <%YakumoYomi> They confirmed that, didn't they? That Intergrade was the only DLC for Part 1?
[3:32:36] <%Caped_Eggy> What if there's no part 2 and everything are just DLCs
[3:32:37] <+megaman_sentinel> yeah this is a grumpy old man
[3:32:37] <$ringabal> LIKE a Wife Beater??
[3:32:38] <johnatella> ooooooh Cait Sith DLC😍
[3:32:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Tone him UP
[3:32:40] <+chrispunchesboulder> I wonder how Vincent will play
[3:32:40] <+CelioHogane> I hope they give a DLC to that girl who tamed Dolphins
[3:32:42] <+NiktenKing> DEFINITELY CANT  do Vincent
[3:32:42] <tolloponik> Cid must be that way you Coward
[3:32:44] <%maskofmichael> He's just into S&M
[3:32:44] <+GingerStrawhat> I kinda want 14 style cid if I'm honest
[3:32:45] <Garnetguy98> Yeahhh
[3:32:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> TONE CID UP
[3:32:46] <Gorgs7> not even, an assistant beater
[3:32:47] <%Ynkubus_> Just make Cid a wifeguy
[3:32:48] <scrublord009> Djent?
[3:32:49] <%Mr_Pylon> I bet we get Rufus DLC at some point.
[3:32:49] <beefcakemanthrob> he does more than come off as one
[3:32:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm half expecting Vincent to be budget-Dante, complete with Devil Trigger
[3:32:52] <Broken_Sonex> SHE'S RUINED HIS DREAM
[3:32:54] <%JoshManVGH> Over under on the dude you get later is a trial run for Cid mechanics?
[3:32:56] <+Chronobot> If they could tone downs Hojo beastiality fetish, they can handle Cid
[3:32:56] <frostyjay3> Cid can swear, but the domestic shit needs to be toned down, but also addressed in some way.
[3:32:56] <Vaunno> ohhhhh, THAT D:
[3:32:57] <%Torus1025> Turn it up, make it uncomfortable
[3:33:00] <Uselesswhitenoise> dolphin dlc
[3:33:01] <%greencapps> That's cause he is pat
[3:33:04] <%whyskeywolfe> TeamFourStar did a 24 hour stream of their FF7 Abridged show yesterday and they turned it into a kink thing Cid and Shera shared.
[3:33:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Make sid beat everyones wives
[3:33:06] <HeroToxiko> they're gonna have to tone some other shit down too LUL
[3:33:07] <rReizs> vincent needs a gunstinger
[3:33:08] <%Valdorick> Remove his wife, have him beat his spaceship AI wife.
[3:33:09] <beefcakemanthrob> i want zack dlc
[3:33:09] <vance168> I hope they keep the Drink yer GODDAMN tea line
[3:33:11] <johnatella> From that one scene in the game I feel like there might be a Cait Sith DLC. 🤔
[3:33:12] <animeshaquilleoneil> Either that or turn Shara UP.
[3:33:13] <+THOUTHPAW> make cid even worse
[3:33:17] <+tigerfang86> Same, but he was!!!!
[3:33:17] <blackjack8182> Cid = Pat
[3:33:20] <+chrispunchesboulder> @PatStaresAt which party member in the remake are you most excited to eventually play
[3:33:22] <frostyjay3> @whyskeywolfe OH GAWD LMAO
[3:33:25] <Wolfstriker121> what about a hardcore smoker
[3:33:27] <%Valdorick> WEDGE IS THE CONDOR KING
[3:33:28] <+Arek_1> Remember that scene at the Temple of the Ancients? LUL
[3:33:28] <tolloponik> that's why Character Growth is Good
[3:33:32] <Albedo28> Hojo just isn't the same character without his weird fetishes though
[3:33:33] <%ShogunNoonto> There's a potion vinding machine
[3:33:34] <%LouieRouie> Shera isn't his wife
[3:33:35] <+TaylOctopus91> But if they tone him down too much, it will lessen the significance of his decision in that one scene...
[3:33:36] <%Torus1025> Those are the eyes of a killer
[3:33:37] <Wolfstriker121> one that smokes 4 at the same time
[3:33:38] <HeroToxiko> bald men need to be noble at least
[3:33:38] <scrublord009> Yuffie member of Wu Tang clan.
[3:33:38] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Dragoons are always assholes so yeah
[3:33:38] <XeroSigmaPrime> Can you imagine how sick that rocket scene will look in the future?!
[3:33:39] <+THOUTHPAW> make him totally unredeemable and the rest of the party just hates him
[3:33:42] <%Torus1025> Wedge is about to ruin your shit
[3:33:42] <%shieldecho> AsexualPride AsexualPride AsexualPride
[3:33:52] <%JoshManVGH> Considering how horney Remake is, hey may be lusting after his wife instead.
[3:33:55] <HeroToxiko> she isn't HIS wife but he still...
[3:33:55] <ape_hawk> wedge's strategy is to just have his cats steal his opponents units
[3:33:56] <+tigerfang86> OH NO HE'S GOOD
[3:33:57] <Gorgs7> But Cid is the only character that believes in Shinra, he's just pissed they cut his funding
[3:33:58] <+Chronobot> Oh god
[3:33:59] <Wolfstriker121> HOLY SHIT WEDGE!!!!
[3:33:59] <SaltyAzteca> SHIIIIIIT
[3:33:59] <ShinMaddrox> He's gonna kick your ass
[3:34:00] <BlueLunecy> Uh oh
[3:34:00] <buthidaebomb> nothing says I love like bag of Valencia oranges upside the head to your partner,shows you were thinking of her and doesn't leave a mark
[3:34:01] <SkinnyRite> RIP Pat
[3:34:02] <%psidefx> STACKED
[3:34:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> Cid should show up with the belt in one fist and a beer in the other, deranged with crazy cocaine eyes
[3:34:03] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[3:34:03] <yourliteraldog> Implied wife beater
[3:34:03] <%walternatorz> You asked for this

[3:34:05] <umbraawitch> i skipped this in the og
[3:34:06] <Albedo28> welp, this seems like a rough match
[3:34:07] <MayShip> of course Wedge would be good at this. he's a nerd
[3:34:08] <+Proxzo> HES A HUGE NERD
[3:34:08] <Psyramics> he's one of those NPCs in XIV that cheats at Triple Triad
[3:34:09] <%weissguard> Wedge doesn't fuck around LUL

[3:34:15] <%condemned_15> m64Damaged m64Damaged m64Damaged
[3:34:16] <frostyjay3> Bro this is gonna be a fight
[3:34:16] <%Valdorick> Wait, is this why Jessie is Rank 2? Because she's casual with Wedge, Condor God?
[3:34:17] <$ringabal> Wedge: "Fuck around and find out, scrub."
[3:34:19] <tolloponik> Wedge the Whale
[3:34:24] <ashuckel> Wedge is a beast
[3:34:24] <+Proxzo> He's a sweaty semi-pro condor player
[3:34:25] <joshujostar> is there any chance
[3:34:30] <frostyjay3> Heaven or Hell Pat????
[3:34:36] <johnatella> Jeez Wedge calm down
[3:34:42] <+spartanghost004> I see that you are challenging the grand master
[3:34:44] <wolfen091> let's rock
[3:34:45] <MasterTonberry23> @Valdorick of course a fat guy like wedge would be into this shit

[3:34:53] <+THOUTHPAW> who's wedge's sponsor
[3:34:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt He has a helicopter?
[3:34:54] <%maskedsongbird> Hearing Wedge's voice even now still fucking sends me. Casting Badger was the best choice the VA casting director could've made.
[3:34:59] <yourliteraldog> Of course wedge is WAAC player
[3:35:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No gods, no masters, only Wedge
[3:35:09] <%Garthunox> @MasterTonberry23 Meaning?
[3:35:09] <Wolfstriker121> give pat your engery people
[3:35:10] <%Torus1025> Wedge defines the Fort Condor meta
[3:35:12] <Wolfstriker121> he gonna need it
[3:35:17] <scrublord009> Wedge: pick a top tier Kappa
[3:35:23] <$ringabal> He has an ATTACK HELICOPTER!?
[3:35:27] <%Valdorick> "I spend all my terrorist money on 3 things. Food, Cats, and Fort Condor miniatures"
[3:35:50] <%maskedsongbird> @Valdorick Wedge would totally be a Warhammer nerd IRL
[3:35:52] <yourliteraldog> he seems to lack air defense
[3:35:54] <SkinnyRite> @valdorick sounds like everyone in the chat
[3:36:01] <+spartanghost004> Time to die
[3:36:03] <Albedo28> Wedge over here about to drop a bunch of COD kill streaks
[3:36:07] <buthidaebomb> dont put your barracks close enough to get sniped pat
[3:36:18] <%maskedsongbird> @SkinnyRite LUL

[3:36:44] <%Valdorick> Oh no, he's built a forward base
[3:36:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> HE KNOWS THE META
[3:36:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Do you think in FFVII Remake 2 they'll expand upon Fort Condor or will it be this but more units?
[3:36:50] <%Valdorick> gonna back it up with an SCV rush
[3:36:53] <thetunnelhomer> Wow, I don't remember this part of FF7

[3:37:46] <%Caped_Eggy> Don't stack units, some have aoe attacks
[3:37:50] <%Torus1025> Look at that SSR
[3:37:51] <Gorgs7> why are you putting the barracks so far forward?
[3:37:51] <Albedo28> pat, stop putting passive buildings on the front lies XD
[3:37:53] <$ringabal> HE'S PLAYING ZORD DECKS

[3:38:30] <MementoAnxius> this sure is ff7
[3:38:35] <rReizs> his only blue is a production facility
[3:38:44] <+THOUTHPAW> se please make this an irl board game
[3:38:45] <Albedo28> what even is that?
[3:38:45] <+Frranky> the choppers suuuuck
[3:38:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah
[3:38:47] <+THOUTHPAW> take my money
[3:38:48] <MasterTonberry23> You've got a lot to learn before you beat me. Try again, kiddo!
[3:38:50] <%maskedsongbird> Need to diversify the approach a little, seems like.
[3:38:53] <wolfen091> yeah he gone
[3:38:55] <%Torus1025> Hold the L
[3:39:01] <Wolfstriker121> HOLY SHIT wedge the real one?!!
[3:39:02] <%Valdorick> What a shame.
[3:39:03] <SomersaultJustice> wedge does seem like the kind of guy that would like this
[3:39:03] <%NateyBeak> wedge is a TRUE gamer
[3:39:04] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT DO WE DO CAPTAIN
[3:39:09] <%maskedsongbird> @THOUTHPAW Right!? I'd spend a shitload of money for an IRL FC game like this.
[3:39:10] <vance168> When you come at the king you best come correct
[3:39:11] <scrublord009> Esports Wedge
[3:39:12] <$SGrim> Like a red-headed step-child
[3:39:14] <Psyramics> I dunno if swarms of weak dudes are gonna work when he's got AOE
[3:39:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is what happens when cute girls try to beat fat guys at RTS games.
[3:39:20] <SkinnyRite> Unit fucking lost
[3:39:20] <xeros720> rip
[3:39:23] <iosephe> rekt
[3:39:25] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt why are you putting the barracks so far forward?
[3:39:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> What a Shame
[3:39:27] <SaltyAzteca> ABANDON SHIP
[3:39:27] <+fetrigon> pfffffffffffftt
[3:39:27] <%Torus1025> 99th percentile Condor player
[3:39:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Get Wedge'd
[3:39:29] <wolfen091> ass thoroughly kicked
[3:39:31] <%YakumoYomi> REKT
[3:39:32] <+spartanghost004> Wedge don't paly
[3:39:33] <+megaman_sentinel> Hold the Line
[3:39:34] <%maskedsongbird> what a shame
[3:39:34] <%JoshManVGH> Wedge is so powerful!
[3:39:34] <yourliteraldog> WAAC Sweat HARD
[3:39:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Lol owned
[3:39:41] <tolloponik> free to play vs Pay to win
[3:39:45] <%JoshManVGH> They are fragile
[3:39:47] <Wolfstriker121> wedge is legit no joke
[3:39:48] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[3:39:52] <%Mr_Pylon> the barracks are taking damage being forward
[3:39:52] <$SGrim> Barracks behind the front-line tend to live longer
[3:39:54] <Louie_Salmon> Basically as far back as possible yeah
[3:39:54] <Albedo28> further back so they can actually produce units instead of losing their HP to mobs
[3:39:56] <%solracc25> yeah
[3:39:56] <SkinnyRite> Too far forward they get sniped
[3:39:56] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[3:39:57] <blackjack8182> What a Shame
[3:40:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> Keep your barracks further back, every time they spawn something it takes some of their HP.
[3:40:05] <%JoshManVGH> They can produce more units if they are harder to hit
[3:40:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> The spawners should be near your towers.
[3:40:08] <%Caped_Eggy> If you have enough units as buffer than sure
[3:40:08] <+ChaosEmralds> it also looks like putting them in front of each other blocks themselves.
[3:40:13] <Profmcstevie> every bit of HP a barracks loses is soldiers it can't make
[3:40:15] <scrublord009> Run it back!!!!
[3:40:31] <xeros720> oh i see, his towers are wrecking your dudes
[3:40:37] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Probabaly just at the canyon
[3:40:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> So they can't attack your barracks.
[3:40:40] <Wolfstriker121> CHAT YOU FOOLS!!
[3:40:56] <%Valdorick> LUL
[3:40:56] <SkinnyRite> @patStaresAt they get sniped too far forward.
[3:40:59] <Louie_Salmon> Towers defend themselves, that's fine
[3:40:59] <joshujostar> so it produces units before rushing in
[3:41:01] <scrublord009> XCOM 3
[3:41:03] <%Valdorick> He's forwarding your mineral line
[3:41:06] <Albedo28> heal your outpost?

[3:41:39] <$Faustgesicht> Heal tower
[3:41:40] <MasterTonberry23> @forgetme000 the fat guy who got his ass bit
[3:41:45] <+fetrigon> place units in front before placing barracks is what I think they meant
[3:41:47] <%Torus1025> I love this for Wedge, he deserves it
[3:41:48] <%solracc25> you need anti air pat
[3:41:49] <$ringabal> Oh no bros, he's brought the helicopter
[3:41:58] <SkinnyRite> Whoever had the "He knows the meta" comment had it on point.

[3:50:10] <%Blackmage9999> rematch

[4:06:06] <+Frranky> Chadley puts the gun in his mouth and DEMANDS you respect him
[4:06:07] <+Arek_1> W H A T . A . S H A M E
[4:06:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe try this again later on?
[4:06:10] <+bugz_munny> more blue?
[4:06:10] <shabop> what a shame
[4:06:10] <%JoshManVGH> You need a faster board.
[4:06:10] <%Mr_Pylon> maybe go quality over quantity?
[4:06:11] <Profmcstevie> needed that right tower to die earlier
[4:06:13] <lazerscraper> Terrorists Win
[4:06:15] <%Valdorick> Get cheaper foot troops
[4:06:16] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Dominated by The Absolute Chad
[4:06:17] <Albedo28> beeg units
[4:06:19] <xeros720> you almost had him though, should've pressured him a bit more to nail that tower
[4:06:20] <MasterTonberry23> You still have a lot to learn before you can beat me. Try again, kiddo!
[4:06:21] <Louie_Salmon> Any other good boards?
[4:06:22] <Uselesswhitenoise> yeah strong with aoe
[4:06:24] <BanSenpai> time for the BIG BOYS
[4:06:25] <%AbnormalVoid> nah, use the weak units
[4:06:28] <tolloponik> ??
[4:06:30] <Psyramics> strong aoe units to cut through his fields of trash
[4:06:31] <SaltyAzteca> Units who can hit with a wide arc
[4:06:34] <Blank9> you can't handle the strongest units
[4:06:37] <Louie_Salmon> Now he's getting it
[4:06:37] <+Frranky> his board makes him so fast it's impossible to outproduce him so you need AoEs and shit
[4:06:40] <%solracc25> MOTH
[4:06:40] <%Caped_Eggy> Too many blues
[4:06:44] <%TheLemuroid> I bet Max beat him
[4:06:44] <+Buzzkill983> Chadley is the real final boss for Yuffie
[4:06:46] <+ThePandoran94> Moth unit is super Good
[4:06:48] <+bugz_munny> oh god theres speed
[4:06:50] <%JoshManVGH> strong units take more ATB right?
[4:06:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> Remember he's got a faster speed.
[4:07:04] <Albedo28> a couple cheap dudes for stall?
[4:07:12] <Albedo28> nope, all beeg, lets go!
[4:07:14] <xeros720> yeah, the number to the top left of the unit portrait is the cost
[4:07:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> You need some ranged Reds to outpace his Slug Ray Facility.
[4:07:24] <$SGrim> Pat, remember the spells
[4:07:35] <+bugz_munny> lol
[4:07:36] <Zantetzuken> chadley's on the move
[4:07:36] <tolloponik> sludge worm is stationary
[4:07:38] <%JoshManVGH> Chadly will have 4 units fielded before pat has 2.
[4:07:39] <%Valdorick> Turret
[4:07:40] <%Caped_Eggy> It's a sentry
[4:07:42] <Sp3ctre48> LUL

[4:08:11] <%solracc25> copter

[4:09:06] <+Buzzkill983> A Hind D?
[4:09:12] <+shadowsvrse> this is giving me crisis core vibes
[4:09:15] <majindusto> CAN PAT DO IT?
[4:09:18] <+AnthraxJohnson> What type of mini game would you guys call this?
[4:09:19] <WreckItRaz> the youtube vod should be titled pat stares at fort condor
[4:09:25] <Louie_Salmon> SICK
[4:09:28] <Albedo28> more beeg unit!
[4:09:31] <%pokefan9956> what the heck am I looking at
[4:09:32] <+bugz_munny> PRESSURE
[4:09:33] <Zantetzuken> tower defense
[4:09:34] <MasterTonberry23> @AnthraxJohnson everyone says its clash of clans
[4:09:43] <%Valdorick> TWO helicopters
[4:09:49] <devanmuse> What're the odds that we make any story progress tonight?
[4:09:50] <Albedo28> heal choppa!
[4:09:55] <Albedo28> nooo~
[4:09:56] <Elsewize> The Blitz
[4:10:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Story?
[4:10:05] <Louie_Salmon> No unit spawners going though
[4:10:08] <xeros720> if you use barrier on that cutter, i bet it could take out a tower by itself
[4:10:11] <+bugz_munny> oh shit here he comes
[4:10:11] <LoneFonte> what story?
[4:10:15] <+RaveBV> here they come
[4:10:15] <%juxtest> Hmm
[4:10:18] <%Valdorick> Pat Rejects coward magic
[4:10:18] <%Caped_Eggy> Poor guy
[4:10:19] <Profmcstevie> Focus down that bird gentleman!
[4:10:21] <%juxtest> Thats a lot of guys
[4:10:24] <%Mr_Pylon> the sky units are tearing Pat up
[4:10:27] <SkinnyRite> Unit fucking lost homie
[4:10:31] <SomeAsianDood> There's a story in this game?
[4:10:31] <+RaveBV> You blew your load too fast.
[4:10:32] <Louie_Salmon> Don't forget about spells
[4:10:40] <SomeAsianDood> I thought this was the main game right here
[4:10:48] <MasterTonberry23> we're losing the left flank!
[4:10:56] <%Valdorick> The Rax don't seem to be working here...
[4:11:00] <Albedo28> get another choppa~
[4:11:02] <joshujostar> maybe the barracks are a bad strat?
[4:11:10] <%maskedsongbird> Do the Fort Condor have any AA options?
[4:11:13] <%Daxalog> Never soley rely on spawners
[4:11:14] <+RaveBV> This gives me mobile game vibes... really successful mobile game vibes.
[4:11:18] <MasterTonberry23> Keep firing assholes!
[4:11:23] <+bugz_munny> oh god
[4:11:31] <lazerscraper> HOLD THE LINE
[4:11:37] <Gorgs7> yeah, I don't think you can win spawner vs. spawner with slower atb
[4:11:42] <frostyjay3> fuck
[4:11:42] <+bugz_munny> why is this so cool
[4:11:46] <%juxtest> PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSH
[4:11:49] <%zacyzacy> Diamond hands
[4:11:49] <%heyitsbrian> the story is about how Yuffie became the best Fort Condor player in the world
[4:11:50] <MasterTonberry23> Push forward! Push forward! MOVE SOLDIER MOVE!
[4:11:57] <SaltyAzteca> BREACH! LEFT SIDE BREACH!
[4:11:59] <monopolyman001> he broke through
[4:12:00] <%Valdorick> In coming counter wave
[4:12:11] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh lawd they comin
[4:12:21] <Zantetzuken> it's not looking good out there
[4:12:25] <+bugz_munny> they're gonna hit the nexus
[4:12:26] <MasterTonberry23> Steady on lads! No retreat, no surrender!
[4:12:28] <LoneFonte> man, this is intense
[4:12:39] <%cvp5127> f
[4:12:40] <+bugz_munny> dude he has so many untils
[4:12:40] <monopolyman001> i wish they made the hp bars different colors so its easier to see who is on what side
[4:12:40] <+forgetme000> this is so frantic
[4:12:43] <Zantetzuken> heavily outnumbered
[4:12:44] <+bugz_munny> holy crap
[4:12:44] <SaltyAzteca> Man where's meteor when you need it
[4:12:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You've lost a turret
[4:12:54] <tolloponik> how dose this keep happening
[4:12:56] <$ringabal> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
[4:12:58] <monopolyman001> i guess they are a little different but kind of hard to see
[4:13:01] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Jesus how many of them
[4:13:03] <frostyjay3> OH GOD
[4:13:04] <MasterTonberry23> Theres too many of em!
[4:13:16] <%Valdorick> The spam won't stop
[4:13:17] <+TaylOctopus91> Gotta get that APM up Patrick
[4:13:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> You needed Red air units.
[4:13:26] <%heyitsbrian> need more big bois
[4:13:33] <$ringabal> THAT'S RIGHT, CHADLEY WILL SACRIFICE GOD
[4:13:36] <wohdin> every time he lets his ATB fill completely i die a little on the inside
[4:13:36] <+Chronobot> Chadley you spamming bitch
[4:13:37] <+bugz_munny> chopper
[4:13:43] <%Mr_Pylon> maybe just try to tank one side and rush the other?
[4:13:48] <Zantetzuken> chadley's digging in
[4:13:51] <Psyramics> you need a tough red anti air for the slug rays
[4:13:53] <Giztech> i say need to zerg it at the start and just hold for time
[4:13:57] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT A SHAME.
[4:13:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 13 Sentinels... 2!
[4:13:59] <+AnthraxJohnson> Chadley is P2W
[4:14:02] <%DashXero> You can beat him.
[4:14:02] <%Eaglestrike117> You need to think about his speed
[4:14:03] <Uselesswhitenoise> i looked up a guide
[4:14:05] <Louie_Salmon> That's some quitter talk
[4:14:06] <%Treuan> You were close, almost had the turret down
[4:14:07] <tralfamad0re> you cab
[4:14:07] <tolloponik> not with big boy strats
[4:14:09] <tralfamad0re> can
[4:14:09] <ohno778> Chadley 2 strunk
[4:14:09] <%Ne1son> zerg em
[4:14:10] <$scallycap> chadleys a chad
[4:14:12] <%bevyrage> you can beat him but you need to better use your spells since you're using the sorcerer board
[4:14:13] <iosephe> so this is why it takes 10 hours
[4:14:15] <%zacyzacy> do you have to aquire more units like in witcher?
[4:14:19] <%solracc25> less grenadier more slug rays
[4:14:19] <majindusto> Chadley  2 Strong
[4:14:19] <%TheLemuroid> You got kind of close to taking one of his towers before the sudden death
[4:14:20] <%bevyrage> oh wait battalion board nvm
[4:14:20] <Psyramics> cutter is useless
[4:14:21] <blackjack8182> What a shame
[4:14:21] <%HiroTSK5> You find more units throughout the game
[4:14:22] <tattleworm> chadley wept, for there were no worlds left to conquer
[4:14:29] <%JoshManVGH> You need some cheap units to compensate for your slower board
[4:14:31] <Uselesswhitenoise> Battalion Board II Armored Shock Trooper  E. Riot Trooper Helitrooper  Elite Helitrooper Shock Trooper  Grenadier Barracks Grenadier   saw this on a guide
[4:14:33] <MasterTonberry23> You will weather this defeat, and you will learn from it.
[4:14:42] <+Frranky> @Ne1son you can't really zerg him better than he can zerg you
[4:14:43] <BanSenpai> looks like sudden death is basically chadley power up
[4:14:45] <susukouhai> WAIT THIS IS INTEGRADE!?!
[4:14:49] <%Valdorick> Chadley "If it can walk, hand it a glock" Ripper
[4:14:56] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt go full super strong, the helicopter alone was wiping out whole waves
[4:14:58] <LoneFonte> @susukouhai LUL
[4:14:59] <+fetrigon> @susukouhai ye
[4:15:07] <+TaylOctopus91> Mirror match it. I know you don't have his board, but can you use the same units?
[4:15:08] <+forgetme000> this is podracing
[4:15:16] <susukouhai> SeemsGood
[4:15:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Riot trooper?
[4:15:22] <wohdin> this is sparta
[4:15:23] <Psyramics> cutter is useless, you can swap that out
[4:15:32] <%AzureGale> Oh are we playing XIV now?
[4:15:32] <$ringabal> Sure is nice of Nomura to throw in a Final Fantasy Demo in his Fort Condor game
[4:15:35] <%MrBorisMakarov> @tayloctopus91 chadleys board is faster
[4:15:36] <Uselesswhitenoise> @TaylOctopus91 you lose the mirror match because he has faster energy
[4:15:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> @TaylOctopus91 Then it comes down to who's faster, and Chadley is faster.
[4:15:43] <%AzureGale> Lord of Verminion
[4:15:43] <Louie_Salmon> I wonder if that reaches
[4:15:45] <dd44dostivei> why does fort condor music use a sephiroth motif?
[4:15:53] <+AnthraxJohnson> Chadley “Chad” Ripper
[4:16:25] <Gameaholic42> Have any magic to nuke it?
[4:16:27] <+bugz_munny> It was during the section to get a big materia  i think
[4:16:28] <$SGrim> He's learning PogChamp
[4:16:52] <+fetrigon> @dd44dostivei cause chadley is a sephiroth clone
[4:17:03] <rReizs> wow he's still bashing against the chadster eh
[4:17:08] <$scallycap> Chadley "Anus" Ripper
[4:17:10] <+bugz_munny> id believe it
[4:17:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think you need Assassin Board 3 for this.
[4:17:15] <%mikeriffic> Give up pat, you cant do it
[4:17:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's got three speed.
[4:17:18] <Louie_Salmon> Spawners are definitely key
[4:17:20] <KyJackshot> Since he has less units he can cycle out his factories faster.
[4:17:25] <Saltmeisterr> do u have blueanti airs?
[4:17:26] <%JoshManVGH> What other boards do you have?
[4:17:28] <%kewlmyc> Chadley whoopin that ass
[4:17:30] <+bugz_munny> My deck has no pathetic cards, Kaiba
[4:17:30] <+senfood> 10 bux says Chadley is a robot version of young Sephiroth.
[4:17:32] <%Valdorick> "We won, but look at all the bodies, sir!" "Bodies? I see only wasted flesh that is no longer a drain our resources" - Chadley after sacrificing 100s of his units to defeat you.
[4:17:32] <%maskedsongbird> Let's be real, the Fort Condor game with Chadley should have boss music playing right now.
[4:17:34] <Psyramics> save for the helicopter
[4:17:38] <+fusionsdf> I beat it without
[4:17:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> Battalion Board II is the one I saw a guide win with
[4:17:42] <+fusionsdf> it's just hard
[4:17:43] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt go high end units, the helicopter was taking entire waves alone
[4:17:48] <%sporeian94> LOL I left to get dinner is he still fucking around with Chadley
[4:17:52] <SaltyAzteca> Chadley "Ultima" Ripper
[4:17:52] <+Noraje> I did it with assassin board II personally, abused the dog
[4:17:59] <zentzen> you need assassin board 3 and your own factories for this
[4:18:05] <BanSenpai> you have a better board then me so you should be able to
[4:18:07] <+fetrigon> @valdorick jesus LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:18:13] <Uselesswhitenoise> Armored Shock Trooper is apperently the secert sauce your missing
[4:18:14] <MasterTonberry23> you can still do it, more than one way to beat an android twink in a board game
[4:18:22] <%AzureGale> The AI is a cheating bastard
[4:18:22] <+fusionsdf> I did it with assassin board 2 and helicopter and spell use
[4:18:30] <+TaylOctopus91> Can we rematch with the lower rank people to get more coins?
[4:18:47] <%Jekado> what a CHAD
[4:18:58] <+AnthraxJohnson> Chadley “Wutai? Goodbye!” Ripper
[4:18:59] <Zantetzuken> chadley is an elite level strategist
[4:19:02] <Louie_Salmon> Spawners seem essential to have at all times
[4:19:04] <Albedo28> doesn't feel like the no spawners rout is the right choice
[4:19:18] <%watts121> Is this the actual game in this game?
[4:19:26] <+bugz_munny> Can you rush him down with smaller units?
[4:19:29] <+ChaosEmralds> to me it seems like the strategy is red and blue anit airs, with gounded greens
[4:19:36] <%Valdorick> SHAME
[4:19:37] <%maskedsongbird> what a shame
[4:19:41] <%AzureGale> "close" "match"
[4:19:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chadley Ripper, the Butcher of Fort Condor
[4:19:43] <LoneFonte> what a shame
[4:19:43] <$scallycap> git gud
[4:19:45] <%TheLemuroid> Same
[4:19:49] <%TheLemuroid> Shame
[4:19:50] <%Monkeyweed21> WHAT A SHAME
[4:19:51] <%JoshManVGH> What other boards do you have?
[4:19:54] <%AzureGale> Pat needs to RAGE
[4:20:05] <blackjack8182> What a shame
[4:20:05] <Uselesswhitenoise> Battalion Board II Armored Shock Trooper  E. Riot Trooper Helitrooper  Elite Helitrooper Shock Trooper  Grenadier Barracks Grenadier
[4:20:11] <+RaveBV> Imagine if Pat ends up spending a day or two trying o complete this, because his mind goblins won't let him advance the story until this is done.
[4:20:11] <$scallycap> you should play better
[4:20:12] <%NateyBeak> what if geif ever finds out that elmo is technically food
[4:20:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Chadley's air are red and green, so anti air on blue and red, then stuff his ground blue with green air?
[4:21:10] <%Valdorick> A smaller deck might work too, if you go expensive.
[4:21:10] <+gespenst25> dogs don't prey upon cats do they?
[4:21:12] <Psyramics> lose the cutter, you never use it
[4:21:15] <%Mr_Pylon> That's my best guess
[4:21:16] <%JoshManVGH> What boards do you have Pat?
[4:21:24] <Jrocy247> Its kinda funny how Fort Condor is the main of Intergrade
[4:21:33] <+red_cuppa> i think the point was more gief will eat anything
[4:21:37] <+Romuken> Wait...just got in, what did I miss?  Should I wait until he's done to watch the stream from the beginning?
[4:21:38] <Psyramics> helicopiter puts in a lot of work when it doesnt face a swarm of green
[4:21:43] <Jrocy247> appeal
[4:21:47] <%TheLemuroid> He's probably spent more time on this than the length of the story
[4:21:50] <+fetrigon> @jrocy247 main of the first act
[4:22:02] <Psyramics> cutter doesnt attack air
[4:22:08] <%NateyBeak> @gespenst25 oh gosh when you put it like that i regret my goofy question ;D
[4:22:10] <rReizs> heli on the enemy red spawn lane
[4:22:11] <%TheLemuroid> of course this is the real game
[4:22:12] <+fetrigon> @thelemuroid tru LUL
[4:22:30] <%juxtest> That cutter did some work to the Condor when you dropped it right on it
[4:23:07] <%NateyBeak> chad chadley cannot be stopped
[4:23:12] <Saltmeisterr> chadley PLZ
[4:23:19] <%JoshManVGH> That was a good materia use on his part
[4:23:28] <+fetrigon> that was an extremely aggressive play
[4:23:28] <%AzureGale> This guy is doing the equivalent of dropping pieces on the board while you're not looking
[4:23:31] <+Romuken> Someone please explain what is happening, I just tuned into the stream?
[4:23:34] <+bugz_munny> he's so fast
[4:23:36] <+fetrigon> damn
[4:23:37] <Albedo28> spawner on right to make him have to split spawns?
[4:23:39] <Jrocy247> Max spent a lot of time on this too
[4:23:41] <+AnthraxJohnson> No breaks on the Chadley train
[4:23:43] <+bugz_munny> he plays at atb 3
[4:23:53] <xeros720> oh, that sledgeworm is hitting the tower, you should keep him alive
[4:24:04] <%Treuan> He's starting to believe
[4:24:08] <BlackStarAura> Such murder
[4:24:09] <%Valdorick> @Romuken Pat is getting stomped by the Minigame superboss.
[4:24:23] <%watts121> Chadly remains undefeated.
[4:24:46] <%AzureGale> Is there a FAQ for this game
[4:24:48] <+Romuken> @Valdorick Thank you.  What is the minigame tho?  This ain't triple triad.
[4:24:56] <%Valdorick> He's only been playing the mini game (and did a side quest)
[4:25:04] <%Valdorick> Its Fort Condor, an Auto Battler
[4:25:05] <%sporeian94> I knew Pat was going to get hung up on this game. I KNEW he was gonna blow a whole stream on this minigame
[4:25:06] <+Romuken> Oh oki
[4:25:08] <%mikeriffic> Pat you need to git gud
[4:25:12] <Uselesswhitenoise> focus on using matria to protect your big dicked units
[4:25:16] <%Caped_Eggy> Rush his base LUL
[4:25:16] <+bobfriskit> wait is this FF7R?
[4:25:16] <+Romuken> So Minion Masters?
[4:25:18] <%sporeian94> It's gonna be 1 by the time he beats is
[4:25:28] <+megaman_sentinel> I don't think this is winnable yet
[4:25:28] <%X2Eliah> So...
[4:25:28] <Albedo28> choppas are beeg
[4:25:30] <$Faustgesicht> So how many chapters does this DLC have?
[4:25:32] <%Daxalog> Is Minion Masters still alive?
[4:25:33] <Psyramics> gotta get rid of the slug rays fast
[4:25:36] <Uselesswhitenoise> protect the helis with heals and barrior
[4:25:39] <%Mr_Pylon> gotta stop his green
[4:25:42] <%juxtest> Creeping advance
[4:25:43] <%condemned_15> can he grind for coins and buy more guys
[4:25:44] <%X2Eliah> FF7R Yuffie is just this minigame?
[4:25:44] <buthidaebomb> put 2 helicopter on,one on each side
[4:25:45] <+bugz_munny> keep the pressure on
[4:25:49] <+Frranky> CHOPPER DAVE
[4:25:50] <+Romuken> Okay, I get it now.  Minion Masters basically @Valdorick thank you!
[4:25:51] <%Valdorick> AIR FORCE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE
[4:25:51] <LoneFonte> HOOOOOOOOLD
[4:25:55] <Uselesswhitenoise> @megaman_sentinel it is even with a level two board
[4:25:57] <Louie_Salmon> He only has one green unit and it's that flying barracks, so he can't counter your helis well
[4:25:58] <+bugz_munny> cutter way up tehre
[4:26:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh boy
[4:26:07] <SkinnyRite> Well fuck what a shame
[4:26:12] <xeros720> man, those sledgeworms put in real work on the towers
[4:26:14] <+TheBitingIrish> "The helicopters could NOT do it."
[4:26:18] <%Caped_Eggy> Those slug rays will destroy your heli
[4:26:19] <Sp3ctre48> that one tower just needs to die
[4:26:21] <+bugz_munny> fuck the line moving back fucked it a bit
[4:26:40] <%AzureGale> F for the helicopter
[4:26:42] <rReizs> need red anti air or a sledgeworm to break a tower
[4:26:42] <Albedo28> that green spawner just deleted your choppas
[4:26:43] <%Valdorick> Chadley of the Counter Attack begins now.
[4:26:49] <%athuramn> F
[4:26:50] <Louie_Salmon> The helis need the slug-rays alongside them
[4:26:50] <+bugz_munny> HOLD
[4:26:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> And here comes The Chad Wave!
[4:27:03] <cocomoloko> just keep trying to sledge one side, they are really putting the hurt on the towers
[4:27:04] <BlackStarAura> Crazy talk activated
[4:27:23] <+fetrigon> omfg
[4:27:24] <+RaveBV> Is there a top down camera view?
[4:27:25] <%mikeriffic> STANDO POWAH
[4:27:29] <%athuramn> this seems like it's going rather poorly
[4:27:29] <%Eaglestrike117> its the slug rays
[4:27:31] <%condemned_15> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:27:33] <sonoheizen> gg
[4:27:35] <%Eaglestrike117> you need to completely counter those somehow
[4:27:40] <%AzureGale> BIG CHEATER
[4:27:41] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat the board you're using seems way too slow, in the amount of time you get 1 unit out, he's already gotten two, even before spawners.
[4:27:42] <+fetrigon> jesus
[4:27:43] <%Mr_Pylon> the downfall came when all hope fell upon the helicopters, they needed red backup
[4:27:46] <%mikeriffic> Pat nooooooo
[4:27:47] <%watts121> WTF I looked away for a second.
[4:27:50] <%mikeriffic> Its time to stop
[4:27:52] <Psyramics> you let slug rays build up on your helicopters
[4:27:53] <+Frranky> I can feel it coming
[4:27:54] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt can you change materia?
[4:27:55] <+Frranky> the win
[4:27:57] <+bugz_munny> is there any downside to spawning big units super close to the line of combat?
[4:27:59] <%kewlmyc> Is Chadley the grandmaster?
[4:28:01] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat why don't you just put more units on the board like your opponent is doing
[4:28:03] <Albedo28> just gotta spawn in a Elite heli trooper to deal with slugray
[4:28:04] <LoneFonte> Poison doesn't seem that good
[4:28:05] <+AnthraxJohnson> Patstaresat Chadley’s presence
[4:28:13] <%solracc25> moth
[4:28:14] <xeros720> i'm thinking you instantly a barrier/regen once the sledgeworm starts hitting a tower
[4:28:18] <Jrocy247> They might as well make a Fort Condor game instead of Remake
[4:28:23] <%Valdorick> Save Bio for his tower/production, maybe?
[4:28:24] <Saltmeisterr> moff
[4:28:24] <%Blackmage9999> poison is only good if you keep them there
[4:28:24] <%pwnjones> Is the Summer Game thing not going to be a vod?
[4:28:28] <rReizs> oh shit the moth might be able to counter swarms
[4:28:34] <Uselesswhitenoise> yeah dont bother with posion, just heals and barriors on big units
[4:28:40] <%Valdorick> @pwnjones DMCA fuckery
[4:28:48] <Louie_Salmon> But his air swarms are green, they counter blue
[4:28:57] <%JoshManVGH> @pwnjones He's uploading it to youtube in a couple days.
[4:29:05] <%juxtest> Damn that Heliotrooper went right through those guys
[4:29:11] <%pwnjones> Oh good, thank you!
[4:29:11] <xeros720> they'll do more damage sure, but blues have a lot more health
[4:29:17] <%X2Eliah> So pat has 1 unit oit, the opponent has like 3. wtf?
[4:29:40] <rReizs> bait the aero with a cheap unit then throw down a chopper against the helis
[4:29:44] <SirDogBear> who needs scissors when you can just use rock more often PogChamp
[4:30:00] <%Daxalog> Its seems like you get 1 mana for ever 2.3 he gets. Value is key
[4:30:15] <+red_cuppa> chadley you monster
[4:30:19] <sonoheizen> Chadly's too strong!
[4:30:25] <Saltmeisterr> u need something to deal with those heli dudes
[4:30:26] <%AzureGale> Use a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun
[4:30:33] <+Lammchen> I'm sorry, what game is this?
[4:30:39] <%AzureGale> Where is the flip board option
[4:30:40] <Louie_Salmon> Regen on the buildings is some good cheese
[4:30:41] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt I think you need a helicopter basically every time it's off cooldown, then you'll win
[4:30:50] <%JoshManVGH> @x2eliah Chadly is using a speed 3 board. if you look at his ATB his segments are smaller. He has unit advantage at all times against pat because pats board takes so much longer to charge.
[4:30:51] <Profmcstevie> Gief has come with advice
[4:30:53] <+red_cuppa> he bleppin!
[4:30:56] <+RaveBV> @Lammchen Final Fantasy 7: Intertactics
[4:30:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> @lammchen ff7r
[4:31:02] <rReizs> damn the slugray spawner does work if it makes all its units
[4:31:07] <%Valdorick> @Lammchen A new Square title, Fort Condor. It came with a shitty Final Fantasy too
[4:31:07] <%AzureGale> Stress relief doog
[4:31:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt replace the ray with grenadiers, all his blue guys are ground-based
[4:31:19] <wasteless40800> what is this final fantasy tower defense
[4:31:21] <frostyjay3> he said, "Dad stop losing to Chadley"
[4:31:28] <+Lammchen> Nobody told me there was a tactics minigame lol
[4:31:33] <%juxtest> CHARGE!
[4:31:38] <Louie_Salmon> You need another slug-ray ASAP, his slug-rays counter your heli
[4:32:05] <Psyramics> moth gonna get devoured by slug rays
[4:32:05] <LoneFonte> that's a beeg AOE
[4:32:11] <Albedo28> please spawn you elite trooper XD
[4:32:17] <%Mr_Pylon> he has so many slug rays out
[4:32:20] <Zantetzuken> gunned down
[4:32:21] <%TheLemuroid> GG
[4:32:25] <%Ne1son> They were green and it was blue pat
[4:32:26] <Albedo28> you just let the slug rays tear them down again lol
[4:32:27] <%Caped_Eggy> You needed red
[4:32:28] <+fetrigon> o7
[4:32:28] <%Monkeyweed21> you sent him out to die
[4:32:33] <+RaveBV> It looks like you have to spawn the Moth unit closer in to take advantage of his AOE?
[4:32:39] <+senfood> Why would you do this, Pat? Why would you commit suicide? I cannot believe you committed suicide.
[4:32:40] <SirDogBear> moth unit wrecked BibleThump 7
[4:32:43] <%Daxalog> All or nothing. You both have high speed now

[4:32:48] <%watts121> why do you have poison at all?
[4:32:48] <Psyramics> elite helitrooper the slug rays to clear them out
[4:32:54] <%Mr_Pylon> slug rays are the real enemy here
[4:33:06] <Louie_Salmon> His only green unit is that slug-ray barracks, if you focus those nothing can fight your helicopter
[4:33:06] <Saltmeisterr> do u have red anti airs?
[4:33:14] <+AnthraxJohnson> Thats a big ol GG
[4:33:17] <+Romuken> where's ifrit

[4:33:19] <%X2Eliah> this seems unfair
[4:33:22] <+Romuken> Pat, do an ifrit
[4:33:31] <+ChaosEmralds> he has a soldier and a heliotrooper
[4:33:38] <%greencapps> just come back later with more crap
[4:33:46] <tolloponik> man the moth unit Sucks
[4:33:46] <+red_cuppa> oof
[4:33:49] <+Romuken> Pat I have no idea how units in this game work.  Do an ifrit tho
[4:33:49] <%JoshManVGH> Paaaat, do you own a faster board than Battalion 2?
[4:33:54] <Psyramics> you keep letting slug rays devour your blue units
[4:33:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> look up a guide
[4:33:57] <+red_cuppa> so stressful
[4:33:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt switch your rays to grenadiers all his blue stuff is on the ground
[4:33:58] <%condemned_15> grind old ranks?
[4:34:01] <%athuramn> DONT GIVE UP
[4:34:01] <Albedo28> gotta control those slug rays with your elite helitrooper

[4:34:10] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Why don't you play the real game instead of this minigame?
[4:34:18] <%Monkeyweed21> focus your red on anti air
[4:34:20] <SirDogBear> maybe just mass helis and go yolo? LUL
[4:34:22] <%Valdorick> MOTHman did NOTHING
[4:34:23] <+CelioHogane> @X2Eliah NEVER
[4:34:26] <LoneFonte> @X2Eliah no
[4:34:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> You have to basically do it now.
[4:34:28] <%greencapps> Didn't you say this was the first room of the game?
[4:34:30] <Albedo28> pat, why must your hurt me?
[4:34:31] <%Monkeyweed21> All his green stuff is in the air @PatStaresAt
[4:34:34] <%Ne1son> You didnt use the helio
[4:34:34] <Saltmeisterr> u need red anti airs
[4:34:35] <+fetrigon> @x2eliah FeelsWeirdMan
[4:34:35] <+ChaosEmralds> you need red anti-airs
[4:34:35] <tolloponik> you didn't eve n spawn him
[4:34:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> @x2eliah This is the real game what are you talking about
[4:34:37] <Uselesswhitenoise> do you have shock trooopers?
[4:34:40] <Psyramics> cutter is not going to help you either
[4:34:42] <%Mr_Pylon> you need something to shoot slug rays, cutter ain't gonna do that
[4:34:42] <rReizs> cutter can't hit air
[4:34:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> this ks the real game
[4:34:45] <Louie_Salmon> Sending the cutter at his slug-ray barracks should be very good
[4:34:46] <%maskedsongbird> cheer500 This game looks really rad (by which I mean Fort Condor). How much money do you think would have to be thrown at Square to get an IRL board game? Thanks for the cool stream and for being a cool dude, Pat!
[4:34:47] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU NEED RED ANTI AIR
[4:34:54] <%greencapps> I doubt Chadley will only be in this one part
[4:34:57] <Albedo28> this is a wipe
[4:35:00] <$ringabal> Screw it, time to go full Brood War
[4:35:01] <plo135> reds need to be able to fly right
[4:35:04] <%Valdorick> He's just gonna aero it

[4:36:35] <%Valdorick> its not
[4:36:36] <+fetrigon> nah
[4:36:40] <%Valdorick> unless you have mind goblins
[4:36:40] <Albedo28> the chad-train has no breaks
[4:36:41] <LoneFonte> nah
[4:36:42] <$Faustgesicht> I really the VOD title is just "FF7R - Intermission Sidequests"
[4:36:43] <%watts121> Mandatory for mind goblins
[4:36:47] <LoneFonte> BUT ITS FUN THO
[4:37:00] <+fetrigon> @jack8274 no... but it is fun

[4:37:04] <vance168> this is some legit fun tactics right here
[4:37:07] <xeros720> i really think that sledgeworm was the trick, it hit a lot of dudes at once
[4:37:09] <+AnthraxJohnson> “Note - they did not give him a break”
[4:37:11] <$Solid_Stro> FF7R; Fort Condor, featuring Yuffie
[4:37:13] <+teh_rawk> is this lords of verminion?
[4:37:24] <Louie_Salmon> Heli was way too forward this game, I think it should be away from his towers
[4:37:28] <rReizs> sledge had solid anti ground aoe
[4:37:29] <Albedo28> and there are the slugs to destroy your choppa
[4:37:30] <BlackermanZX> i think pat needs assassin board for this
[4:37:31] <xeros720> of course, i wonder if you can just set up a bunch of sentry guns next to your towers
[4:37:34] <LoneFonte> rip
[4:37:37] <Albedo28> shame about no anti-air reds XD
[4:37:39] <%juxtest> that Condor has a family Chadley!
[4:37:39] <%X2Eliah> At this point I don't see how Pat can actually win this. It will go into sudden death and Pat will have like 20 enemy units to take care of

[4:38:24] <SirDogBear> NO HONOR LUL
[4:38:26] <Albedo28> just makes sure to have your own red anti-air.

[4:38:47] <$Faustgesicht> There is no honor among children
[4:38:53] <+fusionsdf> yeah I cheesed him on one side and rushed the tower that didn't have his stuff in front of it. And then used barrier and regen on that stuff. then held out and won on time
[4:38:59] <%JoshManVGH> lol "just beat up the child and take his toys"
[4:39:03] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt the sledgeworm does a line attack that can damage his towers from mid-field. It's great against him.
[4:39:05] <SirDogBear> Pat will never be a Klingon now BibleThump
[4:39:11] <+AnthraxJohnson> The virgin Pat vs the chad Chadley
[4:39:13] <falyden> I love this playthrough.
[4:39:13] <+fusionsdf> and wait for him to group stuff up on his strong side and poison it
[4:39:16] <Albedo28> quick unit into sledge worm
[4:39:18] <Lucreto> i think what i ended up doing was using the spell board with three damage spells used them to take out a condor on the side and just played the waiting game
[4:39:37] <%juxtest> It made Chadley put his barracks back further at least
[4:39:39] <%Valdorick> Chadley wants none of that.
[4:39:40] <Albedo28> Pat, I'm taking unblockable damage here >.<
[4:39:40] <Elsewize> Push the line early for advance placement.
[4:39:46] <%Eaglestrike117> Wait
[4:39:53] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt they have to be on the side with units approaching to attack
[4:39:55] <%athuramn> waiting
[4:40:04] <%Eaglestrike117> what if you just rush one side and then go full defense? would that work?
[4:40:28] <xeros720> oh, that got him to waste his aero, that was good
[4:40:29] <$Faustgesicht> For real tho, this vod is gonna needs a preface
[4:40:35] <rReizs> there sledge on the right side

[4:40:41] <%Caped_Eggy> Now you a green barrak down that lane
[4:40:45] <%maskofmichael> I like how this stream as had almost zero story progression
[4:40:57] <Louie_Salmon> Stacking units is way better than spreading out
[4:41:02] <%Jekado> There is a story?
[4:41:07] <%AzureGale> LET GIEF POOP
[4:41:07] <SirDogBear> this is the story, it makes more sense than the actual story LUL
[4:41:08] <Albedo28> sledge up top~

[4:41:38] <$Faustgesicht> The story is there's a condor on that side on of the arena
[4:41:43] <$ringabal> HOOOOOOOLD
[4:41:44] <phantomsleeves> this is hilarious, i wonder how long the dlc is if you skip the side stuff
[4:41:52] <Albedo28> gotta gtet a spawner down soon
[4:41:56] <LoneFonte> @wolfen091 we beat wedge, but Chadley is a real problem now
[4:41:57] <+Mr_Misanthropy> This is the intermission
[4:41:59] <rReizs> RAYS UP
[4:42:00] <%Daxalog> OBEY THE WORM
[4:42:01] <%juxtest> AIR SUPERIORITY
[4:42:01] <$Faustgesicht> like 6 hours?
[4:42:02] <%cvp5127> nice of them to add a yuffie side mission in the fort condor dlc
[4:42:10] <SkinnyRite> omg he actually might win this
[4:42:12] <xeros720> you can cast on his side right?
[4:42:13] <vance168> Yoooooooo
[4:42:15] <LoneFonte> HOOOOOOOLD
[4:42:27] <%JoshManVGH> Fort Condor in FFXIV, when!?
[4:42:28] <SirDogBear> the story is Pat must play more RTS games after this LUL
[4:42:30] <Louie_Salmon> You countered the slug-ray base, might have an actual shot here
[4:42:30] <%X2Eliah> man those spawners
[4:42:32] <%Valdorick> Mothmandraws is here to kill your enemies
[4:42:32] <Gorgs7> yesssss, he's learning
[4:42:35] <vance168> Salt his earth!!!!
[4:42:35] <Albedo28> need red anti air
[4:42:36] <BanSenpai> pats gonna be here for a while
[4:42:37] <%Valdorick> and tank the floor, and he's all out of enemies
[4:42:45] <%Nekros4442> MORE COPTERS
[4:42:47] <$Solid_Stro> Is Sephiroth gonna challenge Cloud to Fort Condor in Part 2? doodNuts
[4:42:52] <%maskedsongbird> @cvp5127 Least it's better than that Squall side quest they shoved into that Triple Triad game.
[4:42:54] <Louie_Salmon> If you kill every slug-ray base as it spawns nothing can hurt your helis
[4:42:56] <xeros720> GO GO SLEDGE
[4:43:01] <Elsewize> BIG BLUUUUUE
[4:43:04] <%Mr_Pylon> slug rays gonna win again
[4:43:05] <%Daxalog> Its all gonna be over in 10 seconds. Sudden death the ai goes crazy
[4:43:06] <%NateyBeak> he basically wins when sudden death hits, gotta hit that tower before that D:
[4:43:13] <%AzureGale> GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:43:15] <%Valdorick> Chadley of the counter attack starts now
[4:43:18] <xeros720> dang, that sledge was hitting the central tower
[4:43:21] <%X2Eliah> rip
[4:43:23] <%heyitsbrian> gogogogogo
[4:43:24] <Psyramics> SLUG RAYS
[4:43:27] <Saltmeisterr> pat why are u putting blues next to greens?
[4:43:28] <Albedo28> pat either doesn't see the enemy slug rays or doesn't know how to deal with them
[4:43:28] <%Caped_Eggy> Gotta get rid of those greens
[4:43:31] <Albedo28> he has the tools XD
[4:43:32] <LoneFonte> big rip
[4:43:34] <%X2Eliah> seriously sudden death = loss
[4:43:36] <tolloponik> ignoring the greens
[4:43:42] <Louie_Salmon> It's over, he has uncontested slugrays
[4:43:43] <%Eaglestrike117> THE SLUG RAYS
[4:43:51] <%Ne1son> You need red units
[4:44:01] <Ultimatefool> Clash Royale???
[4:44:03] <Albedo28> slug rays have been there for like a full minute, pat
[4:44:04] <Saltmeisterr> dude like
[4:44:07] <Albedo28> like for reals
[4:44:14] <%Ne1son> too late now
[4:44:15] <Saltmeisterr> you keep ignore the rays man
[4:44:16] <%Daxalog> Seems like you gotta cheese out one turret before sudden death or its over
[4:44:17] <+spartanghost004> how long has he been at this?
[4:44:19] <%sporeian94> it's over pat...
[4:44:19] <+Mr_Misanthropy> What's his APM chat
[4:44:20] <Saltmeisterr> thats what's getting you
[4:44:25] <Albedo28> at least I'm having a good time lol
[4:44:30] <Psyramics> yes you do
[4:44:32] <Louie_Salmon> @spartanghost004 Like an hour
[4:44:36] <+CelioHogane> You literally said "Where did they come from"
[4:44:36] <%sporeian94> @spartanghost004 A good hour or so
[4:44:38] <%Monkeyweed21> you need red anti air man
[4:44:38] <$scallycap> bodied
[4:44:41] <LoneFonte> @Mr_Misanthropy LUL
[4:44:50] <%maskedsongbird> The side with air superiority wins...just like real life.
[4:44:52] <+ChaosEmralds> youre not using strong enough red anti air's
[4:44:52] <SkinnyRite> That poor baby condor, man
[4:44:55] <Psyramics> you ignored two ray spawners, did not summon a single red unit
[4:44:55] <%kewlmyc> Been 4 hours and haven't even met Sonon yet. LUL.
[4:44:57] <Giztech> cheese one side. that slegwrom in mid kinda screwed you lol
[4:44:57] <iosephe> F
[4:44:59] <@SoFarFetched> look this is truly the gameplay we were waiting for Kappa
[4:45:04] <%Eaglestrike117> dude just rush a side and go full defence
[4:45:05] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> CHADley
[4:45:07] <Uselesswhitenoise> do you have shook troppers?
[4:45:07] <%Daxalog> Hes not ignoring them its just the opponent gets lots of mana when sudden death happens.
[4:45:08] <Albedo28> you did great until you summoned another copper in front of greens
[4:45:08] <tolloponik> spawn them
[4:45:08] <%Valdorick> Then you need to place it Kappa
[4:45:09] <%kewlmyc> Also Chadley is dominant
[4:45:09] <%maskofmichael> then use it?
[4:45:10] <%JoshManVGH> Chadley is a fucker
[4:45:12] <%Eaglestrike117> Yeah and you dont spawn em when you need em
[4:45:13] <%Caped_Eggy> You don't use it tho
[4:45:13] <@SoFarFetched> fuck the yuffie content,its all about fort condor
[4:45:14] <%JoshManVGH> Jebus
[4:45:17] <+ChaosEmralds> swap the helio with the elite helio
[4:45:17] <BanSenpai> believe in the heart of the cards
[4:45:22] <Louie_Salmon> No just hit the slug-ray bases before they can spawn anything
[4:45:24] <Saltmeisterr> ok then use them then
[4:45:24] <Albedo28> just be sure to notice his rays and places your reds to counter
[4:45:25] <rReizs> and don't throw the red anti air against his blues
[4:45:31] <%Mr_Pylon> left always spawns the blue crawlers
[4:45:35] <Albedo28> you were do close to pushing him onto full defense
[4:45:38] <+senfood> Fort Condor: Intergrade
[4:45:38] <%Daxalog> Rush a side. Forfeit if sudden death.
[4:45:46] <tattleworm> try and keep something in front of your sledges, they hit super hard but get torn apart so fast
[4:45:48] <%TurranosOrn> how come he doesn't make any barracks
[4:45:51] <blackjack8182> Kick his ass
[4:45:54] <%Valdorick> @SoFarFetched You panicked me there for a second, because the first line of that is just "fuck the yuffie"
[4:45:54] <Louie_Salmon> No don't throw something at a tower, they shoot
[4:45:55] <%TurranosOrn> I understand none of this
[4:45:56] <%JoshManVGH> The next podcast is going to be so lit with the Fort Condor discussion.
[4:46:05] <$Solid_Stro> @sofarfetched Fort Condor; Featuring Yuffie from the Final Fantasy series

[4:46:34] <%X2Eliah> @JoshManVGH eeeh with woolie's back, could bbe 2-3 more podcastless weeks
[4:46:37] <%sporeian94> Push early and push hard, focus on a single strong unit with high health (Armoured Shock Trooper or Helicopter work well) and use healing and barrier magic to keep it alive, then drop a few low-cost troops to back it up and tp deal with bad matchups.
[4:46:43] <%cvp5127> the fort condor dlc
[4:46:44] <%juxtest> Sneaky barracks

[4:47:36] <%sporeian94> THIS COULD BE THE ONE
[4:47:47] <LoneFonte> MAYBE?????
[4:47:48] <+CelioHogane> You should have put the helicopter more to the left so it focused the tower
[4:47:48] <%Daxalog> OH SHIT
[4:47:52] <Albedo28> pat can't see his own reds nor enemy greens but it doesn't matter

[4:48:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What a shame
[4:48:39] <johnatella> I was thinking try using low cost units, keep helo, and some barracks. Fill the bar, low cost units first, then high cost units.
[4:48:40] <+momegee> Throwing NotLikeThis
[4:48:41] <@SoFarFetched> save birb geefBlank
[4:48:42] <LoneFonte> PROGRESS THO

[4:48:45] <%watts121> rush a side just pick one
[4:48:46] <%beepbeepbopbop> Not like this
[4:48:46] <$SGrim> If only you had some kind of big boxy unit to put in the way
[4:48:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yeah we got a stew going yall
[4:48:48] <hairtoday> can you stuff a bunker in a lane to jam it up?
[4:48:49] <Profmcstevie> You could have still clutched the Sudden Death PrideShrug
[4:48:52] <$RealThiele> somebodys getting fuuuuucked
[4:48:54] <+GingerStrawhat> This is the finaliest of fantasys
[4:48:55] <Giztech> ha he got cheesed back
[4:49:01] <%TheLemuroid> We now know you can cheese the barracks placement
[4:49:02] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @Frostydough1 Still FF7 just minigame
[4:49:02] <Grandnatics> You'll never get phoenix materia pat NotLikeThis
[4:49:07] <+pre10cious_1> Pat have u tried not sucking?
[4:49:09] <$Solid_Stro> Chadley > Sephiroth
[4:49:13] <+xiccy> @Frostydough1 This is Final Fantasy Princess
[4:49:14] <%juxtest> Put it as far to the side as you can so the troops dont get distracted by enemies
[4:49:33] <+GingerStrawhat> He's been pounding away at this for about an hour and  a half and we are beating this fuck
[4:49:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> Chadley using the units family as leverage to make them work harder in sudden death
[4:49:37] <Doomstar16> This is looking fun.
[4:49:39] <@SoFarFetched> he's gonna hit you right in your chadleys
[4:49:40] <%Valdorick> BOLD
[4:49:52] <Albedo28> I guess we aren't doing a rush one side anymore lol
[4:50:02] <Louie_Salmon> Their tower shoots, pay
[4:50:03] <%X2Eliah> yeah your bird is a goner again
[4:50:04] <%athuramn> I feel like you give up too much advantage by letting them push to mid right at the get go or is there some kinda limitation I'm not seeing
[4:50:08] <%watts121> ONE SIDE PAT
[4:50:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> I legit don't give a fuck about the main story anymore, I want this child to perish
[4:50:09] <xeros720> yeah, units prioritize units they can hit, the sledge is just so good because his attacks go through everything
[4:50:09] <Saltmeisterr> Watse
[4:50:10] <%watts121> ONE SIDE
[4:50:10] <DSD24> Pat's a Fort Condor streamer
[4:50:13] <%Eaglestrike117> what happened to rushing the left
[4:50:13] <Saltmeisterr> waste
[4:50:14] <$Solid_Stro> Crossdress to confuse the Chadley
[4:50:14] <%Eaglestrike117> you HAD IT
[4:50:22] <SkinnyRite> Surprised there
[4:50:24] <%Monkeyweed21> this is literally the opposite of rushdown
[4:50:27] <wohdin> I want that twink Obliterated
[4:50:34] <SkinnyRite> Surprised there's still 1200 people watching LUL
[4:50:36] <brisk_dacat> So is Chadly the tru final boss?
[4:50:36] <ashuckel> stall one side and rush the other with super tank units+ regen
[4:50:41] <%X2Eliah> The problem with rushing etc. is that Pat just doesn't have his units out fast enough
[4:50:42] <%TheWinged7> "its just a quick 4 hour game"
[4:50:42] <%Valdorick> Chadley seems to place a rax next to a tower, if possible, drop your offensive spell both of those.
[4:50:43] <frostyjay3> Fort Condor needs to be a separate game. This shit rules
[4:50:45] <+CelioHogane> YES, THAT?S THE WAY
[4:50:47] <%sporeian94> This is basically that star trek episode where Data has to beat the grandmaster of that weird square game with the finger things
[4:50:49] <%emperordread> I just got here, is this intergrade??
[4:50:53] <%juxtest> It was the soldiers from the barracks that did all the damage, the big units just pushed the line up
[4:50:57] <tanarath> @athuramn letting them push to back gives you more firepower from your towers & counterpicks
[4:50:59] <$RealThiele> 1200 people watching goblins consume a man
[4:51:24] <cocomoloko> thats the ticket!
[4:51:27] <+CelioHogane> Defend now!
[4:51:33] <+pre10cious_1> Fort condor feat Yuffie blah blah lol
[4:51:34] <+michingmallecho> "I could bang the Yuffie episode out in one stream" - said by many
[4:51:36] <%TheWinged7> @emperordread it is now that pat found the minigame and refuses to come back later
[4:51:36] <xeros720> and the sledge got it!
[4:51:36] <+RowenCleric> this is why we all watch Pat, this right here
[4:51:37] <Louie_Salmon> You should put poison in front of your tower

[4:53:50] <%Valdorick> And, Chadley of the counter attack
[4:53:51] <%Eaglestrike117> JUST GO IN ON THE LEFT ITS UNDEFENDED
[4:53:56] <Grandnatics> Too late for Red
[4:53:56] <%SMuffinMan> Is Pat liking Fort Condor?
[4:53:59] <Profmcstevie> That towers going down
[4:53:59] <%juxtest> The left Condor is the weakest one!
[4:54:04] <LoneFonte> go for left tower!
[4:54:06] <%watts121> he could have just stayed in base and defended >_>
[4:54:06] <$ringabal> PAT THE LEFT
[4:54:07] <+ValarMorgoth> why would you not focus the other small bird on the left side?
[4:54:13] <Otatoptohami> is this normal chad or hard chad?
[4:54:13] <+CelioHogane> Stop putting units where the enemy has units, they will focus them!
[4:54:15] <Albedo28> red spawner!
[4:54:15] <$Solid_Stro> You fell into my trap card, said Chadley
[4:54:22] <%MisterRockett> This looks way harder than the original Fort Condor.
[4:54:23] <%Mr_Pylon> slugs out!
[4:54:27] <%AzureGale> F
[4:54:29] <tanarath> pat only attack and stall
[4:54:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wow Pat just panicked hard
[4:54:34] <Zantetzuken> supreme chadley
[4:54:36] <tralfamad0re> is he still fighting chadly lol
[4:54:37] <SaltyAzteca> MY KINGDOM! BibleThump
[4:54:40] <$RealThiele> no this is just as hard as old fort condor
[4:54:43] <%Ne1son> The choke
[4:54:44] <%X2Eliah> ahahahhahaaa
[4:54:44] <%greencapps> got greedy
[4:54:45] <+pre10cious_1> INCONCEIVABLE Patrick
[4:54:47] <%Eaglestrike117> forfeit its done
[4:54:48] <Louie_Salmon> Spawn barracks!
[4:54:49] <%AzureGale> Not lose
[4:54:50] <%maskofmichael> Get Good
[4:54:52] <tolloponik> take out the greens
[4:54:52] <Grandnatics> NOT SEND A HELICOPTER
[4:54:53] <$ringabal> USE BARRIER
[4:54:54] <%Monkeyweed21> CHOOOOKEEE
[4:54:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> Defend, got too greedy
[4:54:55] <%watts121> so greedy
[4:54:55] <%Eaglestrike117> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BARRIER YOUR BASE
[4:54:56] <ashuckel> @PatStaresAt  get one tower and stall
[4:54:57] <%Ne1son> You were supposed to not choke
[4:54:58] <+ChaosEmralds> swap the helio for an elite helio
[4:54:58] <%Mr_Pylon> go hard on left instead of centre
[4:54:58] <%Daxalog> You had already won
[4:54:59] <+ValarMorgoth> go for the left side was what you were supposed to do
[4:55:01] <%Monkeyweed21> USE RED ANTI AIR
[4:55:01] <Giztech> greedy pat
[4:55:01] <%Valdorick> Defend instead of going for the win
[4:55:02] <SeruraRenge> of course it's harder, the original ft condor you could just let them attack the base and then auto-win when you defeat the easy monster in a regular battle
[4:55:02] <+CelioHogane> @GalacticaPhanto He got cocky and decided to try to beat the main base instead of defending when he could have defended
[4:55:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think the helicopter earlier was a mistake
[4:55:02] <Albedo28> counter the rays, you waited for a chopper instead of handling his greens
[4:55:03] <tanarath> DEFEND AND NOT GET GREEDY
[4:55:03] <cocomoloko> get 1 and HARD def
[4:55:04] <Grandnatics> FRAUD ALERT
[4:55:04] <%bevyrage> either take out both of the forward towers or hold the line
[4:55:04] <%TheLemuroid> You had it before they killed your bird
[4:55:04] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt barracks can be used as roadblocks as a last resort
[4:55:04] <Link232> Put a green factory on the left side probably
[4:55:07] <+EdeninShambles> Not be greedy
[4:55:08] <+spartanghost004> Your units are to expensive
[4:55:10] <blackjack8182> Win
[4:55:11] <%athuramn> that works if he's trying to hold the line I think. otherwise he's just giving up positions. is poison not something that can be used to more effectiveness? @tanarath
[4:55:11] <%Torus1025> I left to go work on school stuff and Chadley's STILL kicking his ass lol
[4:55:12] <SaltyAzteca> Final Fantasy Fort Condor LUL
[4:55:12] <Albedo28> that was the turning point. Doing good though, don't give up!
[4:55:12] <$Solid_Stro> doodDed
[4:55:12] <Louie_Salmon> That wasn't even over, you had 8 mana
[4:55:13] <Zantetzuken> even if it takes all night
[4:55:14] <Otatoptohami> use sorceror, gank one of his outposts then play defense for three min lol
[4:55:18] <+ValarMorgoth> once right side is destroyed, go left.
[4:55:19] <brisk_dacat> Is slug ray helping you at all??
[4:55:22] <rReizs> put a barracks behind your line during a stalemate for max units
[4:55:23] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt replace your slug-ray with a grenadier, it's not really doing anything for you
[4:55:26] <%Valdorick> Does... Sudden Death increase ATB charge
[4:55:26] <devanmuse> just turtle like fuck once you have a lead
[4:55:34] <%Valdorick> because Chadley seems to go OUT OF CONTROL during it
[4:55:41] <%juxtest> Dont get cocky
[4:55:42] <%blastazoid00> I cant belive i've watched 3 hours of fort condor
[4:55:48] <%bhp_99> His blue spider units can’t hit air units
[4:55:49] <LoneFonte> CHOKE
[4:55:55] <Albedo28> red spawner
[4:55:56] <+michingmallecho> I believe in you Patrick, hasL
[4:56:05] <%Keaton_x> Don't be afraid to use your slug-ray. They're great at taking out blue ground units
[4:56:09] <%Torus1025> Has he tried a phalanx formation yet?
[4:56:12] <Albedo28> here we go. Green spawner right side!
[4:56:12] <$Solid_Stro> Time to take the weights off and goblin the fuck out of this
[4:56:15] <Louie_Salmon> This is the way

[5:06:15] <%Torus1025> Tank
[5:06:15] <devanmuse> is sonon going to be proto-cid?
[5:06:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> Anyone who tries to fight you through Fort Condor has to deal with the new Grandmaster @PatStaresAt
[5:06:20] <+Mr_Misanthropy> the lag on pso2 new genesis is unreal right now

[5:07:09] <@SoFarFetched> I thought that said "Subverse" materia geefStare
[5:07:13] <%maskedsongbird> @RealThiele Seriously. What was wrong with "Wutian?"
[5:07:19] <Albedo28> Man, if it turns out he's Gackt
[5:07:20] <%Torus1025> HP for Tank
[5:07:24] <+red_cuppa> he's not playable but you can mess with his equipment and loadout
[5:07:27] <+megaman_sentinel> what's that chick name from 13
[5:07:27] <%watts121> Did Pat beat Chadley? I had to go poop.
[5:07:39] <%maskedsongbird> @watts121 Yup
[5:07:39] <+red_cuppa> he did beat chadley!
[5:07:40] <Gorgs7> I doubt he's gonna be any good, he's probably there to just soak damage and make the main characters look cool
[5:07:42] <wolfen091> ya
[5:07:47] <%juxtest> It was a glorious victory
[5:07:50] <$RealThiele> typecast
[5:07:53] <Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched I think i know what that one does Kreygasm
[5:07:55] <%coreyyotto> Is there a point to Steal if you can use Mug?
[5:07:57] <SaltyAzteca> I AM THE GRAND FC MASTER
[5:08:00] <+Frranky> @Gorgs7 he is in fact totally vital to how you play the rest of the DLC
[5:08:00] <Saltmeisterr> thx billy bob
[5:08:04] <+Arek_1> Remember, you can't switch to him.
[5:08:07] <%AzureGale> poop brek

[5:09:03] <Guardiansaiyan> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[5:09:10] <Blank9> I legitimately have not seen any of the stream that's not ramuh or fort condor
[5:09:10] <@SoFarFetched> FF7 = Fort Fondor 7
[5:09:13] <Broken_Sonex> So yeah, we're calling Stick Zack, Stack now, right? Is this what we're rolling with?
[5:09:23] <%maskedsongbird> Works for me
[5:09:34] <wolfen091> makes sense
[5:09:46] <+OzdotTV> Stackon
[5:09:56] <pipboy344> @SoFarFetched if there’s more Fort Condor I’m outta here before I eat a bullet
[5:09:59] <%athuramn> wolcen was a terrible game

[5:10:50] <@SoFarFetched> You came to a Pat Stream
[5:10:51] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[5:10:56] <%athuramn> go watch cutscene lmao
[5:10:58] <Broken_Sonex> @wolfen091 Nah, we gotta go allll the way to Wrestlemania with STACK
[5:11:00] <+OzdotTV> *Stack from the hidden Wutai zone, Wutonga
[5:11:01] <Detrius25> How feel about ffVII vll Pattron? psaLiz
[5:11:02] <@SoFarFetched> Podcast -gameplay with podcast
[5:11:10] <%athuramn> there are youtube videos all for that
[5:11:10] <@SoFarFetched> then more zangief
[5:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah if you LITERALLY just wanted story,this was definitely not the stream
[5:11:27] <@SoFarFetched> geefLul
[5:12:26] <%athuramn> yall need to remember what a game is and chill out when a guy is playing one
[5:12:40] <@SoFarFetched> "mmmm meee play the story for meee"
[5:12:56] <Albedo28> I don't watch pat for story, aside from his mass effect streams. I like him farting around doing a bunch of extra stuff.
[5:13:06] <Albedo28> mass effects has the farting around as its story though
[5:13:12] <@SoFarFetched> we're truly all here to watch pat fart on stream
[5:13:16] <@SoFarFetched> featuring gameplay
[5:13:16] <%X2Eliah> @SoFarFetched Oh come on its not unreasonable to be miffed about watching a side min9igame for 4 hours
[5:13:28] <%BulbasaursCry> Just got here - were people upset he played the game not the way they wanted him to?
[5:13:30] <%Jekado> @SoFarFetched NO I"M HERE FOR ELMO
[5:13:36] <%Jekado> psaPorgmo
[5:13:37] <Jrocy247> Itll be interesting seeing Pat tryna sell Woolie on Fort Condor
[5:13:41] <Albedo28> @SoFarFetched I am behind this all the way
[5:13:42] <%weissguard> It's not exactly obligatory to stay and watch that though.
[5:13:47] <blue2red> CoolStoryBob
[5:13:47] <+OzdotTV> nah I come here to watch zangief's burgers
[5:13:48] <monopolyman001> hes been in fort condor land LUL
[5:13:51] <%athuramn> it really is though. you're essentially saying "no do what I want tho" lol
[5:14:00] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its pretty much,if you're not liking what you're seeing on stream you leave geefShrug
[5:14:05] <%MrP33Ps> no ones forcing anyone to watch it for four hours lmao
[5:14:10] <pipboy344> @Albedo28 there’s a difference between say Yakuza Side Stories and playing Mahjong for 5 hours
[5:14:15] <%weissguard> Hypothetically, you could just leave if you saw something that wasn't what you came for.
[5:14:21] <@SoFarFetched> Telling a streamer to "hey stop having fun playing the side content" is a bit much geefAwk
[5:14:24] <%MrP33Ps> stay mad I guess
[5:14:24] <%X2Eliah> @pipboy344 this
[5:14:27] <JetpackMcQuack> And with a suicide joke
[5:14:33] <phantomsleeves> did max finish the dlc last night?
[5:14:38] <frostyjay3> @Jrocy247 If Pat sells it in a way that makes it sound like Triple Triad than Woolie will be hooked
[5:14:41] <%king_wragles> lmao, is someone trying to dictate what the stream should be?
[5:14:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> Imagine being mad at content
[5:14:46] <pipboy344> @sofarfetched I didn’t say anything to him
[5:14:46] <@SoFarFetched> @pipboy344 I mean if pat wants to play 5 hours on stream of Mahjong ,let him. It's his stream.
[5:14:48] <+OzdotTV> this is zangiefnemlostaresat featuring their pets pat & paige right?
[5:15:01] <@SoFarFetched> People are free to leave whenever.
[5:15:07] <%BulbasaursCry> zangiefsnoresat
[5:15:20] <%athuramn> lol what is the actual difference though. They're literally both games. what are these terrible arguments  @pipboy344
[5:15:28] <Dabrikishaw> Exactly. I am unironcially calling it a night right now and will catch the rest on youtube
[5:15:32] <Jrocy247> MMMMMM MEEEEEEEEEE
[5:15:38] <%AzureGale> zangiefeatsat
[5:15:47] <%MrP33Ps> but meeeeeeeee
[5:15:47] <pipboy344> @sofarfetched  and then we lose the Sector 7 Plate because the stream recording shit the bed
[5:15:58] <agadejobi> Well, if you didn't want to watch someone play minigames...get the game yourself?
[5:16:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> Real talk tho, it isn't like he ISNT going to play the story, he'll just do it at his own pace. maybe skip this stream and come back when he streams story?
[5:16:13] <%BulbasaursCry> I'm still pissed stream ate that recording
[5:16:20] <@SoFarFetched> I mean stream shit happens geefShrug not like that can't be predicted.
[5:16:21] <agadejobi> Shit, I'm gonna watch what I missed on Youtube, and jjust skip these parts
[5:16:28] <agadejobi> I've got no fucking idea how Fort Condor is played
[5:16:28] <%AzureGale> You totally did
[5:16:28] <%athuramn> @agadejobi there's a good opinion
[5:16:29] <pipboy344> @agadejobi So you have a PS5 for this PS5 exclusive content?
[5:16:29] <Psyramics> you did?
[5:16:31] <%BigCoffee> 4 hours of fort condor
[5:16:36] <Psyramics> you did spend 4 hours doing side shit
[5:16:40] <+Arek_1> LUL
[5:16:43] <TheAntiNihilist> DOING NOTHING?
[5:16:43] <Albedo28> yeah, but it was great, Pat
[5:16:44] <%TheWinged7> you did
[5:16:44] <%Arancet> i feel like that too

[5:19:28] <Albedo28> it's okay pat. We know you can't handle the raw power behind Fort Condor. Thanks for sticking with it though
[5:19:29] <+senfood> 72 is perfect.

[5:19:40] <WillofGame> I'd kill for it to be 70 degrees where I'm at.
[5:19:42] <+GingerStrawhat> It's been super hot down here in Colorado
[5:19:44] <%Robot_Nixon_> that condor game only hypes the chocobo races for me.
[5:19:48] <+Frranky> chapter one: 4 hours 23 minutes
[5:19:49] <+Romuken> It's 26c in my house @PatStaresAt
[5:19:52] <%weissguard> Guys. 22 degrees Fahrenheit would be below freezing. Ofc it's metric.
[5:19:52] <%AzureGale> (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
[5:19:54] <%cvp5127> back to terrorism
[5:19:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 72 is too hot for hardcore gaming
[5:20:00] <%sporeian94> Everything's all looney tunes up there
[5:20:02] <+GingerStrawhat> Like 35 for Canada
[5:20:03] <thecreecherfeecher> What have I walked in to.

[5:20:06] <@SoFarFetched> geefSmugAF
[5:20:06] <SeruraRenge> farenheit is celcius multiplied by 9 over 5, then add 32 to that

[5:32:54] <%Arancet> ah, but if they caught, shinra will ASSUME its a fake name! that how you get em
[5:32:55] <+SolidusRex> Her fake ID's name should've been Brian McGee
[5:32:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> not like Yuffie'd show up in a shinra census though
[5:32:58] <%cvp5127> @AzureGale he has one its called dirge of cerberus
[5:32:59] <joshujostar> what if it's misspelled
[5:32:59] <%MisterRockett> I can't wait for this Yuffie to be surrounded by characters who find her annoying.
[5:32:59] <%sporeian94> My name is You... uh... Fee...
[5:33:05] <The_Vainglory> It kinda works because who would be stupid enough to make a fake ID with their real name?
[5:33:08] <+forgetme000> i think the three avalanche members are the ones barret talks about in his date scene with cloud
[5:33:09] <%ospreyworks> 22 Year Old Midgaran Organ Donor
[5:33:11] <blackjack8182> Godo has the same last name?
[5:33:15] <agadejobi> 's FF7R video, I went back through original FF7, and I can't believe how many details I forgot as a little kid
[5:33:19] <majindusto> It was hinted that Jessie  used to be their ID person
[5:33:25] <%Maids4lyfe> @X2Eliah he's just a sephiroth clone, they existed in the other ff7 games
[5:33:27] <Jrocy247> @AzureGale I hope so
[5:33:29] <+Frranky> I feel like there's no way they just let wutai people work at shina right?
[5:33:34] <+Frranky> they gotta be hella racist there
[5:33:39] <%AzureGale> @AzureGale Yeah but what if they made it good :p
[5:33:40] <%athuramn> no steadfast?
[5:33:43] <agadejobi> I had always though that Jenova was just some monster they found, not something that came from space
[5:33:45] <+senfood> All Midgardians are automatically part of the organ donor program. They don't get used to save people. They jjust get sent to Hojo.
[5:33:46] <%athuramn> yay steadfast
[5:33:53] <%AzureGale> Let's leer at the sleeping kid
[5:34:06] <%DashXero> Jenova is basically The Thing.
[5:34:07] <agadejobi> PAT READ MY POST
[5:34:08] <The_Vainglory> Cosmic horror shit
[5:34:10] <ChungusQuest> "The Calamity from the Skies"
[5:34:11] <+Freelance7> Wait...has he been playing Fort Condor most of this stream?
[5:34:11] <%Mr_Pylon> Jenova's like a different Lavos
[5:34:13] <RushUnplugged> Jenova is an elder god from space that feeds on planets, that's old canon
[5:34:16] <agadejobi> I'M ON MY WAY TO BE E-FAMOUS
[5:34:16] <+RaveBV> Technically 50% of it is Hojo's fault
[5:34:19] <+RaveBV> He's ACTUALLY evil
[5:34:19] <blue8moon> Jenova came from space to kill the planet in the original game LUL
[5:34:21] <blackjack8182> She’s the Thing
[5:34:23] <Profmcstevie> A monster that came from space and fought all the summons to a draw back when they were just part of the world
[5:34:24] <+BIumen> @Freelance7 all of it
[5:34:27] <+Arek_1> But wait, Jessie was saying that they got help with the ID-cards. ...It was Reeve.
[5:34:29] <+TungstenViper> GG
[5:34:30] <%maskedsongbird> @agadejobi Jenova's basically Lavos if it was a shapeshifter instead of a parasite that burrows under the ground.
[5:34:35] <majindusto> JENOVA IS LITERALLY  "THE THING"
[5:34:37] <ashuckel> technically the main culprit is hojo
[5:34:38] <+Freelance7> Jesus christ
[5:34:42] <%ospreyworks> @senfood I get the feeling most Midgarians have some degree of cancer with all the Mako radiation
[5:34:48] <%slimmixrp> Oh fuck for real
[5:34:49] <mortificent> Sephiroth is probably still a war criminal tbh
[5:34:50] <%Arweynn> Jenova is just Magic-The-Thing
[5:34:52] <SaltyAzteca> Damn she can run
[5:34:55] <+BIumen> it was like some kind of Final Days
[5:34:56] <%athuramn> why is Jesus censored
[5:34:57] <+spartanghost004> didn't she die?
[5:35:00] <MasterTonberry23> as far as where jenova came from, or why it wants to destroy the world, that has never been explained
[5:35:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Sephiroth is more or less hijacking the Jenova cells to do shit from beyond the grave
[5:35:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Jenova is a Cronanberg monster
[5:35:02] <agadejobi> Yeah, I know that now. But when I was a little kid, a lot of FF7's more intense details went right over my head
[5:35:06] <+SolidusRex> Where'd that Summon lore come from?
[5:35:07] <%MisterRockett> .... OH
[5:35:08] <frostyjay3> Idk man. Hojo set a lot of shit in motion that could easily make him the main villan
[5:35:08] <XeroSigmaPrime> XD Yuffie is a teenage mutant ninja
[5:35:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yuffie's just built different
[5:35:14] <GalaxyUni> wait jenova fought all the summons?!
[5:35:16] <+RaveBV> Hojo is the actual problem. Jenova wouldn't have even been a problem years later without Hojo fucking around. Sephiroth is only fucked in the head because of Hojo.
[5:35:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Jenova fought all the summons?!
[5:35:21] <+forgetme000> teenage mutant ninja....
[5:35:22] <%maskedsongbird> Oh yeah, I forgot that detail about Jenova vs. the Cetra summoners.
[5:35:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> HOW
[5:35:25] <Blank9> the weapons stuff is insane too with dirge of cerberus thrown in
[5:35:25] <%AzureGale> WHAT
[5:35:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> COWBOY BEBOP MUSIC YEYEYYE
[5:35:30] <The_Vainglory> Guns you idiot.
[5:35:30] <$ringabal> See ya later, fuckers!
[5:35:31] <$RealThiele> prequel game with the ancients would be rad
[5:35:35] <%AzureGale> WHY
[5:35:37] <frostyjay3> @XeroSigmaPrime Hero in a Moogle Poncho....WUTAI POWER

[5:35:48] <blue8moon> hush you moogles are mystical creatures
[5:35:49] <Saltmeisterr> @MrBorisMakarov ITS CALLED JAZZ U FUCK
[5:35:49] <%nevan_44> SourPls
[5:35:50] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[5:35:51] <Vaunno> jazz time
[5:35:52] <+Arek_1> LUL
[5:35:56] <SaltyAzteca> Jazzy turtle?
[5:35:56] <%MelBrooksKA> 'You go this way, I'll go home'
[5:35:59] <%ospreyworks> wait where did all this summon canon come from??
[5:36:01] <Hick12> No stay with Nayo, she is pretty!
[5:36:02] <frostyjay3> Cue the Bebop
[5:36:02] <@SoFarFetched> Excuse you Jazz? Don't you mean Persona 5 music? Kappa
[5:36:07] <+Arek_1> SourPls
[5:36:11] <@SoFarFetched> Persona 5 invented Jazz you know
[5:36:13] <+RealPT1> i remember the original translation made it seem like jenova was one of the ancients
[5:36:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> @saltmeisterr rooSmug
[5:36:19] <%X2Eliah> @MrBorisMakarov cowbop beepbop it is
[5:36:25] <frostyjay3> @MrBorisMakarov oh shit I love this pERSONA 5 TYPE BEAT
[5:36:29] <Ner234> @Saltmeisterr But Cowboy bebop invented Jazz Kappa
[5:36:30] <+Kharinite> this track is tasty
[5:36:30] <$RealThiele> this hold music is really fast paced
[5:36:32] <+Ghufufin> "hey boss we're in the middle of a big chase, yea lets stop and take care of some shopping first"
[5:36:36] <%justcallmebobplease> I just want to see Turk: LEGEND get one cool moment - be it in a recollected flashback, a side-story encounter, a VR battle, or what.  Just give us AAA-budget 'the coolest Turk boss fight'
[5:36:36] <%maskedsongbird> You know, it's funny. The Cetra are played off as like peace-loving hippies; until you remember all the badass summons they had at their disposal. You think maybe they were more warlike than the modern-era FF7 world makes them out to be?
[5:36:43] <mortificent> @RealPT1 Hojo and Sephiroth think she's an ancient
[5:36:43] <%MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched No, I mean Cowboy Bebop music, duh
[5:36:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Man, can't believe Bebop ripped off P5 Kappa
[5:36:52] <Vaunno> it only gets more SourPls from here
[5:36:53] <$ringabal> Wow, they really made Fate Extra into a music genre
[5:37:00] <blue8moon> psh, everyone knows the ancients of amaurot invented jazz Kappa
[5:37:02] <%Jekado> If this has Jazz is this a rip off of Persona? psaSmug
[5:37:02] <+Frranky> I think the soundtrack for this DLC is mainly the FFXIII guys too
[5:37:03] <Seth_Tek> [vibing Cat Gif]
[5:37:04] <TheAntiNihilist> Hope you love Jazz
[5:37:05] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA Cowboy Persona 5
[5:37:06] <blackjack8182> It’s killer
[5:37:09] <Ner234> Bangers everywhere
[5:37:09] <agadejobi> Well, you can be peace loving and not want to be absorbed and eaten by an alien monster that fell from the sky
[5:37:14] <Vaunno> catJAM
[5:37:19] <+forgetme000> whos jazz?
[5:37:21] <+Ghufufin> is this more Lupin than Bebop?
[5:37:23] <susukouhai> cant believe cowboy bebop invented the time machine just to ripoff p5
[5:37:36] <@SoFarFetched> no no this is totally Gundam Thunderbolt
[5:37:38] <%BigCoffee> Somewhere, some idiot is saying "This has some big persona 5 vibes"
[5:37:39] <%maskedsongbird> @agadejobi True, but we're talking about the same people that came up with motherfuckin' METEOR
[5:37:46] <majindusto> FFVII  REMAKE IN ITS ENTIRETY  HAS AN AMAZING   SOUNDTRACK
[5:37:57] <agadejobi> Well, sometimes you just gotta blow up the whole planet
[5:37:57] <tattleworm> you'll have to order him to use that skill to level it
[5:38:03] <%AzureGale> WHAT
[5:38:05] <Mattais88> I love this Lupin III soundtrack
[5:38:16] <Broken_Sonex> I hate this guy's hair
[5:38:19] <Profmcstevie> Good thing they don't have bullets in their guns
[5:38:20] <%BigCoffee> Sonnon has one heck of a jawline
[5:38:21] <kyong_few> wait why is she his boss?

[5:55:22] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this is ridiculously like Cowboy Bebop
[5:55:24] <%justcallmebobplease> Behemini
[5:55:25] <@SoFarFetched> everyone's gonna have the case of the jazz hands after this session
[5:55:26] <%ospreyworks> SO SMOOTH
[5:55:29] <%X2Eliah> @Taisuru LUL nice
[5:55:31] <%zyberion626> *not pictured the full jazz ensemble just off screen
[5:55:36] <$SkeletAlpha> Never expected to tune in to Intergrade and catch Big Band/Jazz
[5:55:37] <Blank9> god that is the ff14 ninjutsu noise
[5:55:45] <+Arek_1> @Taisuru LUL
[5:55:52] <+FrenchTact1cs> Stream volume seems low
[5:55:54] <+senfood> This song is basically just Jupiter Jazz.
[5:55:57] <%s_xylocalsingles> @zyberion626 thatd be fucking funny, just a truck carrying a whole jazz band slightly off frame
[5:56:10] <%Daxalog> You took it off him
[5:56:12] <%maskedsongbird> Man, I want a copy of this song for my workouts. This is great!
[5:56:14] <+Frranky> the monsters also have synch oh no
[5:56:31] <Vaunno> this is so "Rush" from CB that it hurts
[5:56:43] <Guardiansaiyan> TO TRAIN THEM IS MY CAUSE
[5:56:47] <+GingerStrawhat> That was sad. he looked like Demon Geiff
[5:56:48] <+shadowsvrse> "boss" yuffies a mob leader now? xD
[5:56:50] <+Kharinite> can a dlc be game of the year?
[5:56:53] <LoneFonte> does Sonon have a Limit Break?
[5:56:55] <%AzureGale> You're simply the best. Better than all the rest. Better than anyone. Anyone that I've ever met
[5:56:55] <%ospreyworks> odds of Weiss and Nero having sync?
[5:56:59] <+senfood> Oh shit, I got it wrong. It's Rush.
[5:57:01] <Guardiansaiyan> FORT CONDOR, GOTTA FIGHT THEM ALL
[5:57:07] <Vaunno> 100%
[5:57:10] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[5:57:12] <Detrius25> CONDOR
[5:57:22] <%Taisuru> Reminder to keep Huton up Kappa
[5:57:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> This is specifically NY Rush levels of intense
[5:57:34] <%X2Eliah> kurrrrrrrre'
[5:57:36] <+Frranky> The ability of this weapon rules
[5:57:40] <+Frranky> It's your elemental finisher
[5:57:42] <%maskedsongbird> IT KEEPS GOING
[5:57:42] <tattleworm> purple chests are always weapons, yeah
[5:57:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think the Gozu drive you just got does something special combined with the Chthonian Armlet
[5:57:47] <%Ixiah> scrolled past
[5:57:49] <%slimmixrp> w e p o n
[5:57:50] <%justcallmebobplease> The blindness
[5:57:54] <+GingerStrawhat> It was a weapon pat

[5:58:06] <frostyjay3> Give it to Sopnon
[5:58:11] <%slimmixrp> Its a big blast
[5:58:13] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[5:58:14] <%X2Eliah> ITS A BEYBLADE
[5:58:16] <+GingerStrawhat> This is the best ability in the game
[5:58:20] <%maskedsongbird> OMG, it is!!
[5:58:21] <SaltyAzteca> Fitting for Yuffie really
[5:58:27] <%condemned_15> fukkin BEYBLADE
[5:58:31] <+Frranky> Yeah Level 3 Elemental Banishment wrecks shit
[5:58:35] <Detrius25> psaLiz That's grovey man.
[5:58:49] <%maskedsongbird> Oh man, I forgot about this weird pseudo-Sphere Grid system.
[5:58:55] <+Frranky> almost everything in this DLC has an elemental weakness
[5:58:58] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> It looks like a DNC weapon from XIV
[5:59:01] <+GingerStrawhat> This is your all rounder weapon
[5:59:09] <Louie_Salmon> Wait that's nuts
[5:59:14] <Louie_Salmon> If it does what it says
[5:59:16] <Nelsukako> so....do you guys think that gackt will get his big dumb entry in yuffie story ?
[5:59:45] <%AzureGale> We Prince of Persia now
[5:59:55] <Louie_Salmon> @Nelsukako Well they've name-dropped him already, basically, so he'll definitely be in the next part
[5:59:58] <%TheLemuroid> Wasn't there already a G reference?
[6:00:04] <wolfen091> no, but gakt is inevitable
[6:00:05] <agadejobi> Does Yuffie already have the weapon she has in her promotional art?
[6:00:06] <Albedo28> dude, suspect turns out to be deepground
[6:00:09] <%AzureGale> ffs Yuffie
[6:00:10] <Albedo28> big bet

[6:00:56] <%maskedsongbird> God, she's such a teenager...
[6:00:58] <Nelsukako> yuffie murdering people theme song
[6:00:59] <frostyjay3> @maskedsongbird Not the greatest ninja, but she's doing her best

[6:01:05] <SkinnyRite> Bruh, you don't talk to a stone cold ender of life like that
[6:01:05] <+Frranky> ninjas flip out and kill people
[6:01:06] <%X2Eliah> Oh ho Yuffie is marked for death
[6:01:08] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Murdered by a child
[6:01:08] <ChungusQuest> Returned to the Lifestream
[6:01:09] <thejr2000> is yuffie a child soldier?
[6:01:10] <%Taisuru> Any chance you could play as Sonon a bit?
[6:01:12] <Jrocy247> CHILL OUT JAZZ GEEEEEZ
[6:01:16] <blackjack8182> Evaporated
[6:01:21] <%Taisuru> Oh, weird
[6:01:30] <Profmcstevie> Sonon is an attachment
[6:01:32] <Dellago> Sonon's not a full character
[6:01:33] <omniv_of_g0r> She Beybleded his head clean off
[6:01:37] <%X2Eliah> Sonon is not feal
[6:01:38] <+GingerStrawhat> It's still pretty interesting
[6:01:39] <$RealThiele> has this track looped yet?
[6:01:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> this jazz chills for NO MAN
[6:01:42] <%X2Eliah> not real*
[6:01:43] <%ospreyworks> Black spot on this guy right here.
[6:01:46] <blackjack8182> Proto Cid
[6:01:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Kinda like if they gave Red more mechanics in the base game
[6:01:51] <%MrBorisMakarov> isn't the drummers hands starting to hurt rooCry
[6:01:52] <ChungusQuest> Pat has previously marked Sonon's unplayability as a significant death flag
[6:01:54] <%ospreyworks> he is toast
[6:01:54] <%coreyyotto> you barely used it
[6:01:56] <+SolidusRex> Boomer Aang
[6:01:59] <majindusto> THE JAZZ HAS NO CHILL
[6:02:01] <SkinnyRite> J. K. Simmons jerkin it to this drum solo
[6:02:04] <%maskedsongbird> @thejr2000 Technically, yeah. Although it hasn't been made clear if she enlisted, was conscripted, or just kind of wandered into the theater of war to do crimes for the lulz.
[6:02:05] <@SoFarFetched> @MrBorisMakarov no he's a strong drummer man geefPoint
[6:02:11] <Albedo28> we all forgot about brumal
[6:02:14] <SaltyAzteca> @MrBorisMakarov Trained professional Kappa b
[6:02:18] <%Ascethetic> not blaming anyone, but the devs said very early that Sonon wasn't going to be playable
[6:02:19] <+Frranky> someday we will see the big banishment
[6:02:20] <tattleworm> brumal didn't forget about you
[6:02:27] <+CherteuseKapibara> cat crimes
[6:02:28] <%Puhff> uptime
[6:02:33] <@SoFarFetched> !uptime
[6:02:33] <%zyberion626> the jazz band in the bg: OH COME ON MAN
[6:02:33] <@Moobot> @SoFarFetched I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 2m.
[6:02:34] <%Puhff> !uptime
[6:02:34] <$RealThiele> save baby grandpa
[6:02:36] <SkinnyRite> Elmo is begging this drumming to S T A H P
[6:02:36] <rReizs> imagine being a level 80 DRK that didn't learn TBN
[6:02:37] <Vaunno> @skinnyrite nah, i dont think it's quite his tempo
[6:02:38] <+Kharinite> more time for tunes then
[6:02:39] <%maskedsongbird> @SkinnyRite LUL LUL
[6:02:43] <%s_xylocalsingles> has the song looped yet?
[6:02:43] <Dellago> Shit, it didnt even click with me that they're probably using alot of beta Cid animations and mechanics for Sonon
[6:02:44] <%AzureGale> Elmo is like "Why is Yuffie such a dum-dum"
[6:02:49] <Mattais88> @Jrocy247 But Jazz is how they know Yuffie is coming. Although since she's a terrorist maybe Beach Boys works better?
[6:02:54] <%X2Eliah> Is Yuffie Australian?
[6:02:54] <+Kharinite> @SkinnyRite haaaah!
[6:03:12] <JetpackMcQuack> 5 loops maybe? it's long
[6:03:23] <+OzdotTV> Mr drummer man's wrist are made of very flexible but sturdy steel
[6:03:28] <JetpackMcQuack> there
[6:03:29] <wolfen091> yuffie, free-form jazz ninja
[6:03:30] <%maskedsongbird> @X2Eliah Uh.....huh? Why?
[6:03:31] <Nelsukako> @azuregale because its kawaii for japanese people i guess
[6:03:43] <%X2Eliah> because boomerang
[6:03:52] <%maskedsongbird> Oh, lol
[6:03:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> did Pat react to the ER trailer on stream?
[6:04:06] <@SoFarFetched> yeah he did,no VOD but the youtube video will be up in a few days.
[6:04:06] <+Kharinite> calling it now: sonom dies, yuffie learns one aspect of adulthood, then proceeds to learn about adulthood from Cid
[6:04:10] <mortificent> @Mattais88 that actually be scary, imagine hearing the first notes of Wouldn't It Be Nice when a terrorist is approachin
[6:04:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Pat did you ever go back and challenge the VR for Chadley?
[6:04:43] <tralfamad0re> shes a ninja
[6:04:44] <DSD24> I liked her little run there
[6:04:46] <SkinnyRite> Potemkin is on these drums it is his driving force.
[6:04:46] <Ner234> Ninja Speed
[6:04:48] <XeroSigmaPrime> Dont clip that
[6:04:48] <%king_wragles> Phrasing

[6:07:10] <SaltyAzteca> BATTERY
[6:07:10] <%cvp5127> fort condor 7
[6:07:13] <Profmcstevie> Gaming for too long, battery at risk
[6:07:14] <+ghostfaceninja_> wait.... Pat did all the fort condor stuff with the base loadout didn't he...
[6:07:29] <%BigCoffee> @ghostfaceninja_ close but yes
[6:07:39] <%TheLemuroid> @ghostfaceninja_ Just what was available in that chapter
[6:07:42] <Vaunno> PAT CHOSE HARD MODE AND SUFFERS THE CONSEQUENCES OF 20/20 HINDSIGHT
[6:07:44] <+JonathLP> Why does Cid look different?
[6:08:07] <SaltyAzteca> FROG AND CRONO X CUT WHEN SwiftRage
[6:08:16] <johnatella> What a good team! Would be a shame if someone DIED SONON.
[6:08:17] <%Taisuru> @JonathLP He has not-a-real-character disease
[6:08:20] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Listen Pat you didn't need it your just built different
[6:08:26] <%TheLemuroid> But if Pat wasn't supposed to do ALL the Fort Condor in the first chapter why did the game let him?
[6:08:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> that chapter?? isn't this still chapter 1?
[6:08:44] <%maskedsongbird> @ghostfaceninja_ Yeah. It's actually kind of impressive if you think about it. "Achievements in ignorance," and all that.
[6:08:45] <Vaunno> yeah, doing it the hard way is an accomplishment
[6:08:47] <%NateyBeak> @PatStaresAt still thinkin we gonna get to finish this tonight? or might there be a part 2 tomorrow?

[6:09:28] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat Chapter 2 doesn't have Condor
[6:09:32] <%AzureGale> @slimmixrp Got sidetracked by minigames
[6:09:32] <Guardiansaiyan> @slimmixrp Fort COndor
[6:09:33] <%TheLemuroid> @ghostfaceninja_ It felt like more
[6:09:34] <blackjack8182> Finish it
[6:09:37] <Nelsukako> you will totally do it Patt
[6:09:38] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt don't forget guarding can heal you
[6:09:41] <@SoFarFetched> "totally can be done in one stream,Pat" you underestimate pat Kappa
[6:09:43] <Nelsukako> you own us
[6:09:46] <%AzureGale> DED
[6:09:49] <%athuramn> I still remember the guy who was like "it's 3-4 hours long"
[6:09:54] <%X2Eliah> well
[6:10:00] <%X2Eliah> game over
[6:10:03] <Psyramics> you can't play as him, so of course
[6:10:03] <+GingerStrawhat> @X2Eliah But it does have combat trials
[6:10:05] <monopolyman001> chadley was 3-4 hours LUL
[6:10:05] <frostyjay3> Pat spent most of the time starting and finishing the Fort Condor and Turtle quest. It's gonna be okay if he finishes another time
[6:10:09] <MasterTonberry23> well if thats not foreshadowing
[6:10:09] <%Taisuru> Sonon died for your sins
[6:10:10] <wolfen091> stack sacrificing for the team
[6:10:13] <SaltyAzteca> CHUG CHUG CHUG
[6:10:15] <%sporeian94> That gets around him not being playable
[6:10:17] <blackjack8182> Chad
[6:10:18] <+Frranky> sonon will LITERALLY die for you
[6:10:19] <SkinnyRite> I imagine this would be a great Cowboy Bebop game with all tHIS SAXOPHONE
[6:10:24] <$SkeletAlpha> A STACKRIFICE
[6:10:29] <+RaveBV> Sacrifice your ally for more time on the clock
[6:10:30] <Airuzen> that'd be a cool ability to have in the main game in Part 2
[6:10:36] <+AutechreTwinAphex> DLC first playthrough lasted me like half of RE Village's runtime - I'd say that is good for $20
[6:10:37] <%maskedsongbird> @SkeletAlpha LUL
[6:10:44] <+GingerStrawhat> I wonder if he will do the VR boss tonight though
[6:10:44] <Vaunno> aww, how....nice?
[6:10:46] <+Kharinite> foreshadowing....
[6:10:52] <%coreyyotto> Foreshadowing much?

[6:11:40] <frostyjay3> Damn Sonon getting radicalized in real time/
[6:11:40] <TheyCallMeVawn> $20 for some good ass DLC jazz music

[6:21:37] <%TheFabledAble> this is what you call "PADDING FOR TIME"
[6:21:38] <BlueLunecy> Is this some kinda weird PS5 flex?
[6:21:38] <+BIumen> wonder if it's a loading screen
[6:21:38] <%beepbeepbopbop> whack a box?
[6:21:38] <+AutechreTwinAphex> would have been fitting as a PS5 launch game
[6:21:39] <Jaysky> The true boss were the boxes along the way
[6:21:39] <SkinnyRite> That box... exploded
[6:21:41] <+NiktenKing> PS5!!!!!!!!
[6:21:41] <iosephe> Big physics engine show off vibes
[6:21:42] <$RealThiele> is boxes what pat calls women?
[6:21:42] <+Take_2_shots> Is this just the Half Life 2 Pick up that can but with boxes?
[6:21:42] <%BigCoffee> and you need items
[6:21:46] <Mattais88> This feels like trying to replicate Cloud box breaking for the moggle kids
[6:21:48] <%LaughingCatt> THERE ARE SO MANY BOXES
[6:21:49] <blue8moon> well it's just busywork to keep the player occupied
[6:21:49] <%AzureGale> F
[6:21:50] <%TheLemuroid> I do like the idea of an inventive boss  fountain
[6:21:51] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this is like what launch games used to do
[6:21:53] <urmom467> wait i'm stupid
[6:21:55] <%Taisuru> RIP Items
[6:21:55] <johnatella> The PS4 couldn't handle all those boxes!!!
[6:21:58] <Tube316> Pat what did the boxes do to hurt you?
[6:22:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yep, it's a minigame.
[6:22:04] <tattleworm> that was certainly content
[6:22:04] <SpellCatty> You missed some boxes at the very beginning
[6:22:08] <%BigCoffee> ff7 always ranked you remember?
[6:22:09] <Profmcstevie> Box Overlord

[6:22:50] <%maskedsongbird> That relaxing jazz synth....reminds me of Blade Runner
[6:22:55] <fatalDestiny> God I'm digging all the sax in the music.
[6:22:56] <Airuzen> the music KEEPS GOING

[6:30:28] <xbb1024> Maybe Scarlett secretly want's to be a zoologist
[6:30:40] <Vaunno> if its a shinra weapon then scarlett made this, yeah?
[6:30:41] <%zyberion626> Yuffie is 16 during FFVII

[6:34:43] <%maskedsongbird> @superc37 The only reference to it was Jessie chilling on 7th Heaven's front porch and Yuffie not being allowed into the bar.
[6:34:43] <%TheLemuroid> Maybe Rufus was his informant
[6:34:44] <%superc37> oooooh this is after sector 5 nvm i mixed it up

[6:36:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, that's a lot better.
[6:36:15] <+ghostfaceninja_> YEP

[6:37:15] <%s_xylocalsingles> @maskedsongbird yeah?
[6:37:19] <@SoFarFetched> "Smoochie smoochie cloud"
[6:37:19] <Vaunno> not in your face, but they're still here
[6:37:20] <$ringabal> Sephiroth could kiss Cloud ANYTIME
[6:37:22] <Profmcstevie> I came back to see what that DICK DO
[6:37:23] <%NopeBadguy> cloud would HATE that
[6:37:24] <%TheLemuroid> They knew the poncho looked better
[6:37:27] <mortificent> HE KINDA DOES THO
[6:37:28] <+spartanghost004> I mean he was thirsting really hard
[6:37:30] <%Jekado> then sepiroth takes out his phone with a picture of Cloud and starts making out with it.
[6:37:31] <Broken_Sonex> And i wanted Zack to watch
[6:37:31] <%sporeian94> Sephiroth came back in time to lovingly kiss Cloud then pound his ass
[6:37:32] <%superc37> wait seriously? we're only at chapter 2 i thought pat or someone said that the new content cpuld be knocked out in a stream
[6:37:34] <%maskedsongbird> @s_xylocalsingles Ah, gotcha.
[6:37:34] <frostyjay3> Now that Yuffie has an updated, 4K model the big arm looks really dumb Lmao
[6:37:37] <@SoFarFetched> @Chatterbox1991 genetics are quite a thing that's complex and weird.
[6:37:37] <%superc37> one guy i guess
[6:37:41] <%NateyBeak> what if... their swords touched~~~
[6:37:45] <mortificent> Cloud would be so uncomfortable
[6:37:45] <thatrandomlurkingguy> I mean, that's basically what he does.
[6:37:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> Cloud saves aerith by kissing the fuck out of sephy
[6:37:49] <%X2Eliah> Maaan Yiffie should have kept the poncho look
[6:37:50] <xbb1024> Then he would make an enemy of Roche
[6:37:50] <+Zeplin666> and he'll be like "Cloud, I am your destiny"
[6:37:52] <$RealThiele> Zack and Aerith gonna make cloud super jelly
[6:37:58] <%AzureGale> Good thing you defeated th Fort Condor
[6:37:59] <+ghostfaceninja_> @superc37, that was before fort condor LUL

[6:43:48] <%YakumoYomi> Scarlet be trollin'
[6:43:48] <%zyberion626> oh okay
[6:43:49] <%maskedsongbird> It occurs to me that Shinra's crime isn't so much how evil they are as it is just their abject incompetence. Even without a moral compass, Reeve would still probably be against the plate thing on account of being the only dude on the executive board with some basic common sense...
[6:43:49] <%MisterRockett> She doesn't care.
[6:43:50] <Vaunno> pat dw about it
[6:43:51] <Profmcstevie> She does not care
[6:43:51] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt She knows but she's trying to bait them
[6:43:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's like Scarlet is a Master baiter.
[6:43:52] <DSD24> She's gonna go stomp some doods nuts now
[6:43:54] <%TheLemuroid> She's totally baiting

[6:44:17] <Vaunno> pat got baited
[6:44:19] <Lumbre1h4> She's sharper than she looks
[6:44:19] <agadejobi> Scarlet loves the genocide-a and she loves the weapon-make-a
[6:44:23] <susukouhai> damn they didnt just got them, they got me too
[6:44:23] <%ospreyworks> a master of... edging, if you will?

[6:44:32] <Uselesswhitenoise> you could of just killed her in the elevator
[6:44:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> So, why did you calm down Yuffie?
[6:44:36] <DSD24> Melphie got blown up
[6:44:36] <Owkono> all I hear is MILFy
[6:44:36] <%BigCoffee> yes
[6:44:36] <%superc37> probably
[6:44:37] <$SGrim> One of those clean deaths by explosions
[6:44:38] <+spartanghost004> the joys of her blowing the fuck up
[6:44:38] <%Xelhesia> it is
[6:44:39] <theloganbrand> oh for sure
[6:44:40] <%s_xylocalsingles> Melphie didnt even do anything to stop the robot, she just ATE the missiles

[6:45:03] <%lemon_lore> so they are cousins
[6:45:04] <%strakillias> You are the one who stopped Yuffie from murdering her in the elevator dude
[6:45:08] <+buffn99> @AbnormalVoid in what way?
[6:45:09] <WHAMBAM> Why does Yuffie's voice actor have so little passion
[6:45:10] <$ringabal> Whenever it is, shit's about to get.........deep

[6:45:37] <wolfen091> idk pat, you d9 live with paige
[6:45:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> Also you are now in Chapter 2.

[6:45:39] <feralspidey> step 1: get materia step 2: ... step 3: profit.
[6:45:39] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA ITS YUFFIE
[6:45:40] <rosemon5001> i know isnt it just greaty LUL
[6:45:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Since the last time that Avalanche stormed the Shinra Building?

[6:45:44] <Broken_Sonex> BIG*
[6:45:45] <agadejobi> Well, when you get not-cool Avalanche and Yuffie leading the plan
[6:45:49] <agadejobi> What would you expect?
[6:45:49] <%BigCoffee> cloud barret and tifa walk in
[6:45:52] <ogpurpledaddy> LUL
[6:45:53] <Zantetzuken> yuffie's no master ninja or strategist like chadley
[6:45:54] <%athuramn> ITS FINE THO
[6:45:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> if Cloud and co. didn't walk in upstairs at the same time, these two'd be turbo-fucked
[6:45:57] <Broken_Sonex> BIG BIIIIIG STUPID
[6:45:57] <%maskedsongbird> To be fair, it IS Yuffie's plan we're talking about, here.
[6:45:57] <TheAntiNihilist> not really
[6:45:58] <%TheLemuroid> This is under terrorist lockdown too
[6:45:58] <blue8moon> at least cloud took the stairs
[6:46:00] <Lumbre1h4> Isn't the basement in shinra usually belongs to the turks where vincent trains?
[6:46:00] <Detrius25> Yep just awful
[6:46:01] <vance168> idk they took the stairs
[6:46:05] <%HiroTSK5> Running up the stairs is the most perfect plan
[6:46:07] <thatrandomlurkingguy> The stairs were brilliant.
[6:46:08] <%linSP> what about the front door?
[6:46:09] <%ospreyworks> At least they didn't get in an elevator with an exdcutive
[6:46:10] <%Taisuru> NOOOOO
[6:46:10] <Blank9> they also rode in on top of a truck
[6:46:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodRage fuck stairs, we go in the front
[6:46:12] <%VashyronM> Avalanche is bad at planning
[6:46:12] <+AutechreTwinAphex> well, the player decides to take the stairs technically
[6:46:13] <+spartanghost004> I mean birds of a feather right?
[6:46:14] <%Monkeyweed21> AT LEAST CLOUD IS WEARING A SOLDIER UNIFORM
[6:46:15] <Vaunno> what do do mean pat it's foolproof
[6:46:16] <xbb1024> That's why Shinra is controlling everything, everyone else is stupid
[6:46:16] <%sporeian94> You gonna play it tomorrow?
[6:46:17] <blackjack8182> A plan made by Avalanche jr and a 16 year old
[6:46:17] <%YakumoYomi> Good business
[6:46:18] <%kewlmyc> Mine didn't take the stairs
[6:46:19] <wolfen091> patuh
[6:46:22] <frostyjay3> Nah dude she ninja'd her way through and used the journo as a diversion
[6:46:23] <+GingerStrawhat> When you think you'll finish it up Pat?
[6:46:26] <Detrius25> Greatest terrorists in the world Avalanche
[6:46:34] <%ospreyworks> At least they stood on top of a TRUCK
