[0:21:06] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat unfortunetly .... "Twitch streamers are not charitable entities, so it is somewhat strange to think of a major source of income to these individuals as an excluded gifts under section 102. This is certainly not a charitable contribution which is available as a deduction to the donor.Dec 9, 2016"
[0:21:06] <%xxinevitablexii> DS2
[0:21:07] <$Mendin> DS2 will have Paige get the hugest
[0:21:08] <Futurecity10> Dark souls 2 is the netflix adaptation of dark souls

[0:46:47] <Lokuul> Look, alright, Christian angels are terrifying, but that thing is...
[0:46:47] <jeecay> Isn't the nature of religion in this series "That's bullshit. But I believe it" ?

[0:47:44] <$Potatisodlarn> DIdn't you miss the first lapp encounter?
[0:47:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> sold heroin.

[0:48:08] <%PipIV> reasons why you should heroin
[0:48:09] <ham_boat> You need to go to that side path that opens up by the knights
[0:48:13] <Hobbiesoftheshire> You didn't meet him at the first bonfire right before the drop to Earthen Peak
[0:48:14] <Videogamer4> ooof

[0:54:51] <Coystick> @mornerboi Spooked
[0:54:52] <harryboi1997> Pat should be a character in Smash
[0:54:57] <IronEncore> Enemies can't attack if you swing at them wildly
[0:55:02] <melzroth> He does if you try hard enough
[0:55:02] <%supermarxio64> apatBig apatCrazy
[0:55:16] <Nil1009> @harryboi1997 WHAT IS HIS FINAL SMASH?
[0:55:17] <Archmortal> good job missing those items, Pat
[0:55:18] <Bouldus> pretty sure theres stuff there
[0:55:19] <shurtal> no it isn't
[0:55:22] <%mornerboi> you forgot your souls
[0:55:23] <DemonicHoward> no there was an ash pile there
[0:55:24] <jeecay> weeeeeee!
[0:55:25] <gameaholic42> No it's safe
[0:55:27] <+kiiiirsten> pat
[0:55:27] <SirKezington> Am i the only one that finds Lanterns, within the context of the DS universe really weird?
[0:55:27] <TalisKanju> Paige should be a character in Smash. Pat should be an Assist Trophy.
[0:55:28] <melzroth> Drop attack the big boy
[0:55:29] <%Notyourcupcake> Anything can be a bonfire if you're brave enough.
[0:55:30] <%Klefth> No
[0:55:30] <Bouldus> yea its not a death trap, theres an item
[0:55:31] <%PipIV> @nightweaver20xx you gave me the biggest chuckle with that comment
[0:55:32] <+Reaper102388> It's where you get the War Banner but sure... death trap... why not?
[0:55:32] <Captain_matt> his final smash is hitting the back
[0:55:33] <%averyoddjew> no that's a safe drop to get the lothric banner spear
[0:55:39] <Redblood801> Try spinning, that's a good trick
[0:55:42] <melzroth> Or run like a biatch
[0:55:42] <pwnhills> That was explicitly not a death trap
[0:55:45] <melzroth> Both work
[0:55:49] <%Klefth> That was a safe path. Well "safe"
[0:55:50] <masso101> His final smash is Elmo, obviously
[0:55:53] <IronEncore> Redbull ram is his final smash
[0:55:54] <Firestone12332> FailFish
[0:55:54] <+JFKRobot> I really want to revisit this, but need to do Bloodborne again first
[0:55:55] <gnarly_memes_bro> @AngriestPat that drop was safe theres a weapon down there
[0:55:56] <%PipIV> safer
[0:55:57] <%mornerboi> Crazy Talk is really, really powerful tonight.
[0:55:57] <harryboi1997> He misses and lets you hit him
[0:55:58] <dsauce999> THEY ILL LIKE ICE AND FIRE BOTH
[0:56:02] <+Nymphonomicon> Anything can be a bonfire if you've got enough combustibles.
[0:56:03] <melzroth> Elmo would be the cutest of final smashes
[0:56:04] <%dozind16> merry christmas pattycakes
[0:56:09] <%xxinevitablexii> Lapp is organizing a group poop
[0:56:12] <NDenizen> Goblins ill like sorcery
[0:56:16] <Coystick> I wonder where Patches wanders off too after he kicks you.
[0:56:19] <melzroth> He derps out of closet then falls down in stupidity
[0:56:23] <masso101> Elmo would crush joker under his bag
[0:56:24] <gnarly_memes_bro> did somebody say group chat group scat?
[0:56:24] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> War banner sounds like an important thing
[0:56:30] <Lokuul> Taking a poop with Lapp and Siegward.
[0:56:33] <TalisKanju> This is funnier imagining he's on the toilet
[0:56:34] <melzroth> Elmo in smash confirmed?
[0:56:42] <AirlineFood74> We share this road with many a traveler, guard and merchant alike
[0:56:44] <+JingKaisean> @angriestpat are you gonna stream dmcv?
[0:56:44] <$GoogleyGareth> Always liked the side character voice actors in the Dark Souls series.
[0:56:55] <%mornerboi> if you aren't organizing a group poop with your covenant, are you REALLY in a covenant?
[0:56:55] <corepool> oh patches
[0:56:55] <harryboi1997> Elmo should at least be a spirit in Smash
[0:56:56] <Lokuul> There's aught, Arisen.

[0:57:02] <NDenizen> Most people miss this little plot twist, which is a shame
[0:57:03] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> iirc he gets it if you die like 3 times or something
[0:57:04] <mecha_11> What shield is that? Grass Crest? Been a while.
[0:57:07] <melzroth> How the fuck did he get down here before you?
[0:57:09] <slyarvicle08> hello @angriestpat it's the first timet
[0:57:13] <MartwyPies> If you die enough times in this zone he give you Titanite Slab

[0:57:17] <Tampaoster> he gives to u

[0:57:20] <%DONGWAVE> and a solemn booty to doot

[1:25:03] <%xxinevitablexii> angel lasers and demon lasers
[1:25:04] <cantmicro> why are these many demons in dark souls? i feel like the theme of the first game was about dragons and gods and the demons were there as a nod to DeS
[1:25:06] <Redblood801> Why isn't Pat popping his Devil Trigger?
[1:25:15] <%AncelDeLambert> except the Demon Prince stays in one place more than Xeno

[1:39:53] <Lukas_Ipsum> I really don't think mass effect will every come to ps4, I'm very suprised it ever reached ps3

[1:40:12] <kamen_advent> Dead Space trilogy is back compat on Xbone too
[1:40:13] <dukenux> Andromeda LUL
[1:40:13] <Archmortal> if the mass effect controller mod works half as well as the New Vegas controller mod, it's totally worth a try
[1:40:14] <+D4C_Trice> honestly I don't mind mass effect on PC, you don't have to open up a menu to get at all of your powers.
[1:40:18] <%TeraMercier> @codussalpha I don't think he counts ME A
[1:40:19] <%Cogito1001> HE SAID THE THING

[1:40:23] <carrotpancakes1> 3 has the best combat
[1:40:23] <%0dokuro> But the trilogy from what I see is just for PS3
[1:40:25] <NewWillinium> The best way to do it is to just BUY the Mass Effect games on the PS4. And all of the dlc. Unfortunately the PS4 never got a port of Mass Effect 1.
[1:40:25] <vedammi> 8============D~~~😜😝😛
[1:40:25] <ham_boat> Stream Mass Effect and let chat vote on all the decisions
[1:40:29] <%BunkusFreskie> yeah, if xbone has all 3, do that
[1:40:30] <%AncelDeLambert> are they gonna actually try to EXPLAIN the Dark Soul? Because that sound stupid.
[1:40:31] <%patricksly36> xbone x also helps with mass effect 1 and 2s insane load times

[1:47:57] <+mstrswrd> I'm lucky- I work retail, but I work overnight stock (technically Planogram), and the store closes at midnight, so I only deal with customers for 90 minutes. So, it's just podcasts/listen to videos on youtube, and work

[1:48:17] <+D4C_Trice> I worked I a video game store and rather enjoyed it but it was on Christmas temp hours but the majority of people who worked with me quit for various reasons such as being lied to about a promotion and the hours being next to nothing for most of the year.
[1:48:19] <DXLelouch24> and if you didnt
[1:48:21] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> My current job is in a grocery store, but I don't work for the grocery store. I don't have to talk to anyone in general either. So it's in a retail environment, but I'M not retail. It's kinda cool.
[1:48:21] <DXLelouch24> shame on you
[1:48:22] <+cuttlecrow> invade invade invade

[1:49:22] <+BlandSpice> @LogothX I did the same thing for Office Depot for a year. It was awful
[1:49:22] <stigna1> I realized the other day that every media, from Lovecraft to Sonic the Hedgehog show, recognizes the suffering of retail workers.
[1:49:25] <romanticzomedy> i'm glad you like it
[1:49:25] <Lokuul> I did too, but it was called GameStop. You'd think it was "Funcoland" with how hard they tried to make us sell the damned things.
[1:49:26] <%TeraMercier> Totes
[1:49:27] <B_ikki> i prefer vanilla as an end to the series tbh but the dlc is great

[1:53:20] <%deviljhojho94> You could feel the salt trough the screen
[1:53:21] <+Maids4lyfe> of course they would worship the man who calls himself GOD
[1:53:23] <Quiet__Viking> this place reminds me of Naboo
[1:53:23] <+Nomicro4u> Divinity Original Sin 2 is great, but probably not the best streaming game

[1:53:54] <%furiousfurioso> If you're like me and have done Act 1 too many times there are mods that exist that let you skip it
[1:53:54] <Sloavon> TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURRRTLES
[1:53:55] <reignbeauxbaer> literally all of dark souls happened because of Gwyn. Humanity would have just taken over
[1:53:57] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat hear about the possible Persona 5 R
[1:53:58] <TalisKanju> It doesn't seem like a great game to stream
[1:53:58] <%BestTeaMaker> Red Prince and Fane forever
[1:54:00] <carlosmanriquez> @AngriestPat he may be but he´s super smoochable
[1:54:01] <%QuadraticGravity> I'd like to play Divinity w/ you Pat :)

[1:54:20] <$MightyMaxT> Spider-Gwyn
[1:54:21] <ape_hawk> everyone else is a bitch

[1:56:04] <+sundizzle> I've lost millions of souls to this area
[1:56:05] <$ooblagis> Pat cowarded out from pretty much all super bosses in Hollow Knight, including all of Godmaster
[1:56:06] <Nil1009> @AXL808 IF YOU HAVE HEX BACK YOU HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO HER NEEDS AND STOP BEING SUCH A SELFISH LOVER

[2:04:52] <SailingSaturn> @Zxtole not the Table minibosses though they should be even harder cirBaka
[2:04:52] <%deviljhojho94> oh fuck that hurts
[2:04:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> P5 switch, no contest
[2:04:53] <%TeraMercier> @Zxtole Those games seem obsessed with their systems, and you would have to change a lot to market to the crowd that learned P%'s accessibility
[2:04:54] <Archmortal> P5 Golden needs an actual localization or it won't be worth it
[2:04:55] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeyeyye
[2:04:57] <Redblood801> @JuiceBlox Both
[2:04:59] <Fujiwara_92> p4 golden for ps4 Kreygasm

[2:05:16] <AnAsianToaster> i want persona 5 crimson in my life
[2:05:16] <$ooblagis> Why would the P5 rerelease not be localised?
[2:05:18] <nikwritesstuff> Pat the plunger
[2:05:18] <DSD24> @Archmortal I mean what's there isn't game breaking but its still od
[2:05:20] <IronEncore> Hack and slash
[2:05:25] <killerjawa> I think it's gonna be called Persona 5 crimson
[2:05:26] <SailingSaturn> @myfaceisapotato cirHi
[2:05:28] <Shooterboy23> why would it be P5 golden if the color of the game is Red LUL
[2:05:31] <Sloavon> P5 Crimson Wind
[2:05:32] <+Belakitu> Persona 6 will have a female protag and take place in a jail Kreygasm

[2:05:42] <Saraceal> who is your god? "Gwyn-t"
[2:05:47] <TalisKanju> Why would the remaster of the best-selling Persona game ever not be localized?
[2:05:51] <Nil1009> NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH A EMO FURRY WITH DEPRESSION
[2:05:53] <+JuiceBlox> @killerjawa P5 CRIMSON PogChamp
[2:05:55] <%0dokuro> Persona 5 "Maroon"

[2:05:55] <Nil1009> IT DONT END WELL
[2:05:56] <+Zxtole> @TeraMercier I would hope with the remaster they give us some updated systems and stuff. At least in my dream version
[2:05:57] <$awsomesaucekirby> P5: but everybody except joker is older, is romancible, and is your teacher
[2:06:06] <AnAsianToaster> did paige ever play persona 5? cause i'd totally watch her stream that
[2:06:07] <Bouldus> slid a sword under the door
[2:06:08] <SailingSaturn> I actually want igor to speak normall in Persona 6 cirTan
[2:06:08] <Archmortal> @TalisKanju because P5 itself barely got localized
[2:06:09] <Fujiwara_92> The name of P5 golden is P5R for now...
[2:06:12] <Mr_Strut> Time to go dragonslaying
[2:06:14] <%Cervantas> Midir is probably the worst boss in souls ever
[2:06:14] <Thors_Left_Nut> I want the new P5 to have better character focus and development and just get rid of Akechi altogether
[2:06:15] <+cuttlecrow> big hard
[2:06:15] <mostundesired> What could POSSIBLY go wrong Kappa
[2:06:17] <sirjonston> Big dragon for big bois

[2:06:38] <IronEncore> Seems easy to me Kappa
[2:06:44] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Do you think this game does a better or worse job with the yellow monk style fight?
[2:06:45] <TalisKanju> They'd be leaving money on the table now if they didn't localize that remaster
[2:06:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> its not really confirmed what P5R is anyway, it could be something completely different
[2:06:46] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> The Dragon is quite predictable
[2:06:47] <%TeraMercier> @Zxtole Absolutely. There's just a big part of their market that 'couldn't' play without them
[2:06:48] <+Kduff89> from has always had a knack for making dlc bosses harder than tempered diamond
[2:06:50] <%deviljhojho94> Persona 5 execpt everyone is dressed like a maid all the time
[2:06:52] <%deviljhojho94> even the bosses
[2:06:57] <+JuiceBlox> P5 needs to have moral consequences for mind raping people
[2:06:57] <%BeardedLuchador> fat gross monstrosities?
[2:07:00] <ape_hawk> ESPECIALLY the bosses

[2:07:30] <+LogothX> Big Ronso Push

[2:07:33] <%SinisterWang> We gotta push Pat for Summerslam.

[2:19:22] <Kev_0snap> if the hitboxes were REALLY that good, a shield on your back would protect you :P
[2:19:23] <%low_hell_key> @Polengoldur what timeline is this?!
[2:19:32] <+SparkAfterDark> They do
[2:19:33] <twin_triggers> that was a slab?
[2:19:36] <suckasurprise> annaDab
[2:19:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> chunk and scale
[2:19:42] <theHypestDeano> hello stream, how is everybody doing
[2:19:46] <%ShaneWhite> Good Job Pat
[2:19:48] <+SparkAfterDark> Not from everything, but shield on the back does factor into some hits
[2:19:50] <Nil1009> MY SECOND FAVORITE PART OF THE BIBLE IS WHEN JESUS CHALLENGES SATAN TO A KNIFE EDGE DEATH MATCH!
[2:19:51] <%PhysicsLB> ok
[2:19:52] <synthcutter> I miss TT2. Tekken 7 is just...no
[2:19:54] <DSD24> @theHypestDeano I am doing good!
[2:20:07] <sparrrow_> now that it's around New Year's time would you consider releasing a merch calendar that has you in firefighter poses for each month?
[2:20:08] <majima666> t5:dr is the best tekken game imo
[2:20:08] <%Saraceal> go hug lapp-o
[2:20:09] <+Meiou> come on pat your supposed to be playing with the handicap of a corpse being dragged along . now thats a real mans challenge
[2:20:09] <+ChrisTheRedBeard> @Nil1009 isnt that just yuyu hakusho
[2:20:12] <majima666> tied with TTT1
[2:20:13] <+CBROGERS2013> @Nil1009 nah man, that was a landmine death match
[2:20:19] <mostundesired> There's our boy
[2:20:20] <%TeraMercier> Pat firefighter calendar?
[2:20:23] <Nil1009> I LOVE YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT REFERENCE
[2:20:23] <synthcutter> Any tekken game is better than 7
[2:20:27] <+Belakitu> My fav part of the Bible is when Jesus body got turned into mcguffins
[2:20:27] <%PipIV> Ladder match to heaven
[2:20:28] <TalisKanju> I asked this once before, but will you ever do an all-French stream one day?
[2:20:28] <+BabyandShar> @angriestpat, I did the thing you wanted, check your Twitter, hope you get sponsored soon.
[2:20:29] <IronEncore> SeemsGood good job
[2:20:32] <majima666> everyone says tekken 3, but TTT1 was basically the same but with bettter graphics and a better roster
[2:20:33] <%pixjames> Shove it all in Pat
[2:20:33] <%cdrom321> @teramercier I'm not going to push him for it. He said that he'll probably get to it next year. That's enough excitement for me. I absolutely enjoyed the KOTOR LP and even played along.
[2:20:36] <+SparkAfterDark> Pat does a calender and it's just the top of his head because he's too short to reach into frame
[2:20:36] <torontototoro> you need to interact with Purging Monument
[2:20:39] <%0dokuro> Literally can see it from here
[2:20:44] <tearsaurther> You gonna solo that hard ass dragon?
[2:20:44] <%0dokuro> Poor Lapp
[2:20:48] <+sundizzle> its literally right there
[2:20:55] <Kev_0snap> too bad you cant just point him to it
[2:20:57] <%AbnormalVoid> I prefer the binging monument, am I right, folks?
[2:21:01] <Kev_0snap> "its right there bud"
[2:21:03] <Tampaoster> SHOW HOOMANITY
[2:21:04] <Lokuul> Almost forgot to say, goodnight @AngriestPat! If not for work, I'd stay longer. Goodnight Chat at large, as well!
[2:21:05] <oponomo2> Now that's a health pool if i've ever seen one.
[2:21:09] <sparrrow_> @cdrom321 it'd be cool if he tried out the story content in SWTOR, it's actually really well done
[2:21:13] <IronEncore> Lapp discouraged :(
[2:21:15] <synthcutter> 5 is my personal favourite, but i love them all really...except 7
[2:21:16] <Fyrijou> He called his cat Elmo? Like the Muppet?
[2:21:16] <%TeraMercier> @cdrom321 Totes. In fact, Pat hypes up the restored content mod so much that i feel like I'm missing out. I played it too many times as a kid to be willing to go through it again
[2:21:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You got his back but who got your back?

[2:42:16] <HyraFukit> @Grandma_Amari I just said chamber it, Nerf guns dont have firing pins.
[2:42:16] <+Ell1ot> I had one with a tank that you wore on your back. I wasn't able to wear it because it was too heavy when it was full
[2:42:16] <dc_8100> i would pay a pretty sum for one of those today
[2:42:16] <%patricksly36> You could only shoot it for like 5 seconds. It was a halo power weapon
[2:42:17] <+sordcooper> wait, the hell is the dragonhunter armor doing down here?
[2:42:18] <%BeardedLuchador> Oh just a casual Dragonslayer Armor no biggie

[2:42:58] <%SulfurousAcid> I think I just had a 100
[2:43:00] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> kinda sucks when you don't get poise but the enemies have ample amounts of it
[2:43:02] <Grandma_Amari> Someone was probably gonna get blinded, it was only a matter of time.
[2:43:04] <NewWillinium> Is Pat going to lose to the best boss and boss weapon in the game?
[2:43:04] <Fujiwara_92> don't trade pat, u can't chug forever
[2:43:05] <Minorou> I remember the commercial for the one that would freeze people. As if the temperature of the water was part of the super soaker instead of what you put into it.
[2:43:05] <fireking900> Orstein's reject brother

[3:05:24] <$codussalpha> Isnt persona that series where they have kids shoot themselves in the head for super powers?
[3:05:27] <%TeraMercier> It's harder to tell when this one loops, with no lyrics
[3:05:33] <%0dokuro> That Persona 3
[3:05:38] <zafooru> Yeah sometimes they rip off their own faces too
[3:05:39] <TalisKanju> So Paige coaches Pat as he pees, while he holds toilet paper rolls in his hands?
[3:05:40] <%0dokuro> and yes
[3:05:40] <Tampaoster> Hey chat how are you doing tonight? We are here for Pat but how about you?

[3:08:15] <axivate_> THIS DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION
[3:08:15] <%mostundesired> This just in, peeing is code for breeding. Know that every time one of them goes to take a potty break.
[3:08:17] <%Remery_> If you Breed in the game, you Breed in real life
[3:08:18] <%Saraceal> Pat, how was the breeding?

[3:35:19] <romanticzomedy> Fanfic crossovers are different because they're ABSURD
[3:35:20] <$Tuskor13> Smash is a fucking crossover
[3:35:20] <dekkitout> amalgam comics
[3:35:20] <Bloodninja15> He aint blind he's just scripted to do dat dumb attack at the start
[3:35:21] <+sadburritoo> I HATE crossovers
[3:35:21] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat What is your guys favourite fetustype?
[3:35:22] <romanticzomedy> See, Paige gets it
[3:35:23] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat MOTHERFUCKING SMASH BROS
[3:35:25] <+velvy_cakes> Crossovers? That sounds lame who would like that Kappa
[3:35:25] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Logan & Potter; Private Detectives
[3:35:25] <ape_hawk> could wolverine survive an avada kadavra???
[3:35:27] <%ssjklyco> What if Papyrus showed up in Beast Wars?
[3:35:28] <dekkitout> need i say more
[3:35:30] <CandideCamera> But Paige what about the crossover event between Harry Potter and My Chemical Romance
[3:35:31] <VHLW> crossovers are meant to be silly
[3:35:32] <+WaywardSera> Pat you're using hammer, spin to win!
[3:35:32] <tri3dgE027> Looking back...this boss kinda fights like Phase 3 Xenojhiva from MH:World
[3:35:34] <$MightyMaxT> So Alien vs Predator vs Batman is lame?
[3:35:36] <TheReallJimbo> that's every archie comic ever
[3:35:37] <+JoeStillLife> lewd
[3:35:38] <+MonsieurHedge> "hurr he has like 10 million hp" nah he just gets an instakill visceral at like 60%

[3:35:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Papyrus would DIE
[3:35:46] <+TheQButton> I like Penut butter and I like Jelly, PBJ is jut the crossover. It's simple.
[3:35:47] <dekkitout> the first batman v predator was rad
[3:35:47] <%wolfofsound> she'd cum so hard she'd be crippled
[3:35:48] <zafooru> crossovers are fun in a dumb kind of way unless they're super canon in both franchies
[3:35:48] <+dougrayman> has pat ever beaten darkeater?

[3:52:24] <%sunriser696> andromeda was bad, but not fallout 76 bad chat
[3:52:25] <Virokwet> 3 only sucked in the last 15 minutes imo
[3:52:28] <%TeraMercier> 3 had some fun gameplay additions

[3:52:36] <DarkKnightGrave> Just like Pat apologizes for MN9.
[3:52:36] <%k0b4lt> HONEST QUESTION: anyone else think the ME series was mediocre at best?
[3:52:39] <+cuttlecrow> 2 sippy sips left
[3:52:40] <%Sulliman34> Turians > Quarians > Asari > Krogans
[3:52:41] <+fantom_flasch> nothing is fo76 bad

[3:52:43] <+yuppie_water> I've only ever played ME:1 do they do the modern bioware thing of becoming less rpg's with each installment?
[3:52:43] <%ToxInjection> It's hard to come close to FO76 bad
[3:52:44] <%SuperCasualBoom> @frostmass22 Marvel should apologize for ruining MvC

[3:52:52] <%Prism_Wing> Might be worth it to buff with some lightning.
[3:52:52] <%Remery_> Asari's are just slutty blue wizards
[3:52:53] <+sordcooper> 3 sucked whenever the chinese space ninja was on screen, and then at the very end
[3:52:54] <+sundizzle> @k0b4lt it could've been a hundred times better
[3:52:55] <%ToxInjection> Andromeda doesn't ACTIVELY scam us
[3:52:58] <%FrostMass22> @SuperCasualBoom They should!
[3:52:59] <%AncelDeLambert> ME did not age well

The highlight was watching my 10 year old niece unwrapped her Nintendo Switch and give me the biggest hug and I realized that as I get older, I love giving gifts than receive them. Hell, my mom dad gave me a $10 gift card simply saying saying “Merry Christmas, son” and that card warmed my heart more then anything. Sure, I got them that expensive, hard to obtain Wagyu beef as their gift, but they deserve it. Merry Bitchfest you two.

[4:27:22] <grace_for_drowning> Well, if you win, you get the dark soul color that that painting chick needs...
[4:27:22] <%bluetocho13> Pat you can tell her all about the fight she will forget by tomorrow
[4:27:22] <%TeraMercier> Fitting that Pat is a contender
[4:27:23] <romanticzomedy> I mean, he IS called "Slave Knight." That's basically "Scrublord"
[4:27:24] <%0dokuro> All for a painting
[4:27:24] <%aishman> Two nobody losers AT THE END OF TIME
[4:27:25] <sjcodan> UH

[4:27:30] <+Camail> wtf? if you dont win then the blood isn't delivered
[4:27:30] <CaptainDictator> GO BACK
[4:27:30] <BuriasDempsey> BUT ITS THE BEST POINTLESS FIGHT
[4:27:31] <%RedMaskBandit> it does..he forgot why he wanted the item
[4:27:32] <+sundizzle> GO BACK
[4:27:32] <gnarly_memes_bro> THATS THE POINT OF DARK SOULS THO
[4:27:34] <FracturedImage> GO BACK
[4:27:34] <DesperaDo2077> the most pointless boss in Souls history
[4:27:34] <%cherubsanonymous> Your nihilism is showing, Pat
[4:27:35] <layssaltflavour> two nobody losers fighting over nothing THATS HYPE AS FUCK
[4:27:35] <danknugglit> but if you win your dick is bigga
[4:27:36] <CaptainDictator> GO TO END OF ROOM
[4:27:37] <Intolerable> @PeachSaliva @AngriestPat Any plans to make Paige play Demon's Souls
[4:27:38] <%RaikenTB> But the winner's dick is bigger.
[4:27:39] <Angry_Ev1L> GO THEFUCK BACK
[4:27:39] <%Bree_Bear> isnt that most fight

[4:27:42] <extradopeness> its fucking all the way to the left
[4:27:42] <+A_Zealous_Retort> gael wouldnt have brought it back, he needed you to kill him to collect the pigment from HIS blood
[4:27:43] <AirlineFood74> IS THIS MGS 4'S ENDING?
[4:27:43] <%Remery_> Oh that sounds depressing...
[4:27:44] <Bouldus> both the player and Gael are both ashen
[4:27:44] <zamzoph> SOUL OF CINDER IS BETTER THO
[4:27:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, isn't Gael essentially someone who is trying to stop the Hollows from stopping the cycle? it kinda is important
[4:27:44] <%ssjklyco> So it does mean something then
[4:27:44] <%mostundesired> There's kind of a reason, but FUNCTIONALLY no reason.
[4:27:45] <%trez_> end of room
[4:27:45] <%LtDogg07> two badass nobody losers
[4:27:46] <WanderingFlame7> Go back!
[4:27:47] <%0dokuro> End of the room pat
[4:27:48] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> The winner gets a spear with a dead body impaled on it.
[4:27:49] <Sofa_King_Hype> Two nobodies fighting over a little bit of money
[4:27:49] <BeefyQueefer> futile fights between other people are always good watching
[4:27:50] <manoshake> filianooore
[4:27:51] <+TheQButton> Literally two random people, at the literal end of the world.
[4:27:52] <Malziel> nothingness... is... ETERNAAAAAAAAAAL
[4:27:52] <%TeraMercier> The true message of Dark Souls was to fight in a field
[4:27:52] <%0dokuro> you have to go all the way in
[4:27:54] <+sundizzle> BACK OF THAT ROOM PAT
[4:27:54] <DesperaDo2077> "badass"
[4:27:55] <extradopeness> no theres another thinggggg
[4:27:56] <HyperBomb21> This is the best part of the game
[4:27:57] <dukenux> End of Dark Souls
[4:27:57] <poweredscoot> It means nothing, and that's why it means everything
[4:27:58] <thewhiterice92> I'd say there is a reason to the fight
[4:28:00] <%0dokuro> welp, nevermind
[4:28:01] <%ThePuddingDead> oh boy
[4:28:02] <%ssjklyco> It means nothing so hard it goes back to something

[4:29:29] <dekkitout> then he comes at you like ya boi arti
[4:29:29] <sjcodan> SMALL DAMAGE
[4:29:30] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> The dark soul is just nanomachines
[4:29:30] <%TeraMercier> The cape shoulda been a projectile
[4:29:33] <%AncelDeLambert> seriously, some dude from Ariadne is here?
[4:29:33] <+ChaosVulpes> He has... SO. MUCH. FUCKING. HEALTH.
[4:29:33] <%Jp3g95> BUT MAYBE WE'RE BOTH THE SAAAAAME
[4:29:34] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Yep. The final fight in the series is so a girl can paint a picture.

[4:29:49] <zamzoph> Pat ain't going to make it this time
[4:29:49] <extradopeness> f
[4:29:50] <%terry_quest> dang first time ive ever seen that grab
[4:29:50] <ThorW> They wanted to end this game off well so they had us fight Artorias 2.0
[4:29:51] <lycandruid> Just dodge 4Head
[4:29:52] <tri3dgE027> Offff
[4:29:52] <BeefyQueefer> this fight is somewhat undermined by the fact that Gael's sword clips through the sand dunes tbh :s
[4:29:52] <%maskedriderhero> There are no heroes here, simply battle and violence and the end of all things.
[4:29:53] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeet
[4:29:55] <+freshlemon8> jeez how much vit does pat have for him to be rocking all this gear
[4:29:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> He already controls his cape like a stand.
[4:29:57] <%0dokuro> @AngriestPat Pestilent Mist's also is great for this guy, but only in his second form
[4:29:58] <%aishman> Oh ha, fighting in the middle of the throme room
[4:29:59] <+mastertwin2> You don't experience this fight properly until you do it on NG+7
[4:29:59] <HyperBomb21> >This theme Kreygasm
[4:30:04] <%GohanEgret> ON OFF DRINK HIT
[4:30:05] <%mostundesired> He's Artorias with Maria's phase 2 and a rad cape.
[4:30:06] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> a sword can you through sand super easy
[4:30:07] <fireking900> When dose he start sonic booming
[4:30:07] <The_Introspector> Ringed City not only has the worst boss in the series with Midir but has the best boss in the series with Gael.
[4:30:08] <romanticzomedy> oh that IS firelink?
[4:30:11] <Jolly_Adventurer> It's just Guts and I love it
[4:30:14] <+namillus> IN FAIRNESS it's an extremely magic painting that will create an entire new world, which is important considering the reality of the Soulsverse has been unravelling since before DS3 began
[4:30:16] <%TeraMercier> @mastertwin2 When he gers the chaingun?
[4:30:18] <%aishman> Looks like it yeah
[4:30:21] <Kalcom> it's ash tho
[4:30:21] <%cherubsanonymous> Gael is so boss
[4:30:22] <sjcodan> ANGRY HOBO GUTTS
[4:30:23] <Polengoldur> so...is this just the Highlander? "THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!" ? if you kill all the magical people the magic condenses into whoevers left?
[4:30:23] <DarkKnightGrave> THE WORLD HAS TURNED SO MANY HAVE BURNED BUT NOBODY IS TO BLAMEEEEE
[4:30:23] <romanticzomedy> oh shiiit i never noticed!
[4:30:28] <HyperBomb21> SourPls SourPls SourPls Kerygasm
[4:30:28] <+ChaosVulpes> I don't know, this guy gave me a lot of bad times...
[4:30:31] <%crimsonharvest> using the club on the fucker was super satisfying
[4:30:34] <Bloodninja15> Every place is firelink
[4:30:37] <%Jp3g95> STANDING ACROSS THIS BARREN WASTED LAND
[4:30:39] <Tampaoster> @namillus FAIR POINT
[4:30:40] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> THE END OF TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I
[4:30:40] <%mostundesired> Wait... Why is your flask only at +9?
[4:30:43] <InsomniacPersona> did pat beat midir?
[4:30:43] <artoflec> the hammer head is so big it obscures the character
[4:30:46] <ZaibatsuFan> siiiiiiiiiick
[4:30:46] <extradopeness> STINGER
[4:30:47] <%AncelDeLambert> oh my god, Pat's hammer is fouling the screen
[4:30:47] <%deviljhojho94> OOF
[4:30:49] <+gael_jebidibah> That was kinda anime
[4:30:49] <+VanaSkiller> wowee looks just like guts
[4:30:50] <Fiend95> Big misses!
[4:30:50] <%ThePuddingDead> who says fat people cant fly
[4:30:54] <sjcodan> ANIME WIFFS
[4:30:54] <Xelhesia> CROSS COUNTER
[4:30:55] <+namillus> If this arena is supposed to be DS3's Firelink that makes two Firelinks in this DLC
[4:30:56] <grace_for_drowning> I think he moves too fast for the charged attacks...
[4:30:58] <spawnzie> A heavy weapon like the hammer will stagger him pretty easyly so there's that
[4:30:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat beat Castlevania as a CHILD.
[4:30:59] <%walternatorz> it's just like watching Pat play Monster Hunter
[4:31:00] <AirlineFood74> COUNTAH
[4:31:00] <%crimsonharvest> GET STUFFED FUCCBOI
[4:31:01] <Lapinelis> @mostundesired Cause he's a scrublord
[4:31:02] <Idon__> big whiff punishes
[4:31:03] <+Tokanova> doODLE DIP
[4:31:05] <DesperaDo2077> >sad music for a nobody we don't know or care about
[4:31:07] <%terry_quest> look at thes 2 anime fucks duking it out in the middle of nowhere
[4:31:07] <%aishman> I mean the thing is, at this point everyone is pretty much dead and the end of the world has come (And so have I)
[4:31:08] <LixFury> that hammer takes up like half the screen
[4:31:08] <HyperBomb21> GEE I WONDER WHY
[4:31:09] <%0dokuro> I'm not complaining, the fact its a painting that was done in the blood of ancient beings is pretty metal
[4:31:10] <+namillus> Since the DS1 Firelink is at the bottom of the Dreg Heap
[4:31:10] <danknugglit> Make sure to taunt right before he dies and almost get boddied
[4:31:12] <dekkitout> "Is this Irithil?"
[4:31:13] <sjcodan> DEAD
[4:31:15] <BunnyMcFluff> he fights like hes kicking yout ass
[4:31:16] <rufus2k2> outriders OUTRIDERS
[4:31:16] <manoshake> for now
[4:31:17] <benjiFG> slap
[4:31:18] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> "Give that Dark Soul to me." No way, you got your own." "Well, I want yours too."
[4:31:18] <+mastertwin2> Fun fact, you can legit roll through his whole combo attack
[4:31:18] <sjcodan> M O R T I S
[4:31:18] <%WheatlyXT> 1
[4:31:21] <+Camail> he fights like he went crazy...because he did
[4:31:22] <fireking900> Sonic Boom time
[4:31:22] <HyperBomb21> PogChamp
[4:31:25] <%TeraMercier> Easy mode relocked
[4:31:25] <$antibonehurtingjuice> WHATS THE SMELL?!??!?!
[4:31:27] <CaptainDictator> when did he lose that huge chunk of torso?!
[4:31:27] <romanticzomedy> THIS MUSIC VoteYea
[4:31:28] <masso101> I fought this guy before midir when I played this... big mistake
[4:31:28] <%crimsonharvest> does taunting pat make him more powerful or more sad?
[4:31:28] <MutedMimic> Kreygasm
[4:31:28] <%aishman> So this fight is completely pointless because it doesn't matter who wins, the painting will be made regardless
[4:31:28] <zamzoph> nice job with phase one, using half your flasks LUL
[4:31:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oops there goes another rubber tree plant
[4:31:30] <%deviljhojho94> POGGERS

[4:32:29] <+VanaSkiller> wowee its the berserk man
[4:32:30] <+GiantsKnife> gatsu
[4:32:31] <grayjammer> Kreygasm THE DROPPPPP
[4:32:32] <%Jp3g95> ITS LITERALLY GUTS
[4:32:34] <%furiousfurioso> rooPog
[4:32:34] <d_jay_o> That STAGGER
[4:32:36] <Idon__> "HEY GUYS, DID I TELL YOU HOW MUCH MIYAZAKI LOVES BERSERK"
[4:32:37] <+Maids4lyfe> I like how Gael became literally Guts
[4:32:39] <caprideus> more berserk than berserk
[4:32:39] <+iconoffilth> Again, closest thing to the Dark Lord we see that the serpents talked about
[4:32:39] <sjcodan> EVER PUNCH AM MAN HARD ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM REGAIN HIS REASON?
[4:32:40] <+mastertwin2> Even GUTS can't attack with his CAPE
[4:32:44] <sqaurebet> rooPog
[4:32:45] <rufus2k2> thatfucking auto crossbow
[4:32:46] <danknugglit> Guts had a dt this whole time
[4:32:46] <+GiantsKnife> berserker!
[4:32:46] <+namillus> Makes perfect sense, the Dark Soul, which is Humanity, is now in his blood.
[4:32:46] <%kewlmyc> He's just Guts
[4:32:47] <%skizzuto> pat's gonna run out of estus at this rate
[4:32:48] <DraxTD> @Jp3g95 naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh .... nahhhh
[4:32:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Is that zerolenny?
[4:32:50] <%TeraMercier> Shit he does have a chaingun
[4:32:50] <alexandrecau> "the blood was in me all along" clearly gael ain't that smart
[4:32:53] <DesperaDo2077> yes he can
[4:32:53] <masso101> Oh my god he's so cool I forgot
[4:32:54] <%0dokuro> I love that the fight is literally two of the main types of boss designs Beast and Human
[4:32:55] <%AncelDeLambert> STOP DRINKING IN FRONT OF HIM
[4:32:55] <limeyprick> is it still Christmas in Canada?
[4:32:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> I think Miura may have influenced this design, HMMM
[4:32:56] <ancrest_tant> @forestfire44 A bunch pyromaniacs try to set the world on fire
[4:32:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> @forestfire44 It’s the Dark Souls of Dark Souls...wait...
[4:32:58] <%mostundesired> Taking a lot of unnecessary hits here, nerd.
[4:32:59] <Peasanttoast> people know what literally means?
[4:33:00] <romanticzomedy> FIGHT TOO HYPE
[4:33:02] <Idon__> wing capes are rad
[4:33:04] <spawnzie> @AngriestPat Fun fact, the Hollow Slayer Greatsword does extra damage to Gael in phase 2, meaning he turns hollow
[4:33:07] <%dimeybot> Pat 'Just tank the hit' Boivin
[4:33:07] <+namillus> He is the closest thing to Human that's ever been in the series since we kicked Manus's ass
[4:33:08] <+sundizzle> YEEEEEEE
[4:33:08] <+ChaosVulpes> Oh no, he has Zeus on his side now.

[4:33:45] <AirlineFood74> PAIGE NO DON;T LOOK
[4:33:47] <zafooru> yes
[4:33:49] <troxcree> I like how he just comes charging at you from down there.
[4:33:49] <extradopeness> you can now play as Kappa Luigi
[4:33:50] <fireking900> Kill the shit King
[4:33:53] <%TONYOO101> What is this genuine affect being shown on stream right now
[4:33:54] <+HunterInABox> Someone explain to me why this nobody character is the most powerful in the series by far?
[4:33:56] <%Rngiddion> like the Dark Souls story
[4:33:57] <%TeraMercier> Zelda barely takes place in it's own universe
[4:34:05] <Nil1009> PLAY KIWAMI
[4:34:07] <romanticzomedy> @HunterInABox He had until the END OF TIME to get good
[4:34:07] <+MonsieurHedge> also, shout out to ledo's greathammer blatantly being a unlabeled Black Knight Weapon
[4:34:11] <dukenux> HITOMI CHAAAAAN
[4:34:17] <limeyprick> hard to see with that hammer in the way lol
[4:34:20] <+ChaosVulpes> I think this guy wanted those other guys' blood to make paint with for his Lady... but they're all undead and their blood is literal ash now so it's color is no longer suitable... so he go nuts... or something
[4:34:21] <%Bree_Bear> i need to sleep apatPorgmo
[4:34:22] <DonatelloJose> Looked awesome
[4:34:23] <Bloodninja15> He got anchor arms
[4:34:24] <%iwishthiswasicq> @AngriestPat Speaking of Yakuzis, how about uploading that video of it?
[4:34:25] <poweredscoot> I like how Japanese devs just make fangames and call them something else. Berserk, Dark Souls. Jojo, Persona.
[4:34:25] <CheekyBirb> you just look big and strong paige
[4:34:28] <ape_hawk> more like slave BITCH gael
[4:34:29] <%bluetocho13> @nil1009 you missed yesturday stream
[4:34:33] <slothslayer828> BIG HAMMER
[4:34:36] <DraxTD> <.< so where's griffith and Eric Sparrow
[4:34:37] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Paige has super lupus.
[4:34:40] <$Mr_Jumbles> okay so I get that Gael goes from huge to mega huge... but how the fuck he get huge in the first place... he was this meek pathetic old man and suddenly became the harbinger of doom BEFORE his final form charity200 #charity
[4:34:41] <%0dokuro> KIRYU-CHAN!!!
[4:34:43] <%TeraMercier> @iwishthiswasicq He waits 2 days to upload, some twitch rule or something
[4:34:50] <ThorW> @HunterInABox Because they exhausted all the cool characters in the lore, but wanted a guts standin/Artoria 2.0 so here's Gael
[4:34:51] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh, that's fine then.
[4:34:53] <rosencruez> Maji-Paige and Pat-Ryu
[4:34:56] <+namillus> But yeah, the "point" of this fight is to refine the Dark Soul and make it a pigment such to paint a whole new world, BUT the effects of consuming the Humanity of the last survivors of the world make Gael too crazy to get back to Ariandel. So it has to be you.
[4:35:03] <Nil1009> @bluetocho13 NO I WAS HERE I JUST WANT MORE
[4:35:07] <dukenux> Dark Souls is more like the aftermath of Berserk, no?
[4:35:08] <zamzoph> "direct relief"
[4:35:15] <DraxTD> damn it LAG!!
[4:35:19] <+jsandvl> WIFFF
[4:35:21] <%bluetocho13> @nil1009 lol oh okay, same here
[4:35:25] <danknugglit> DO IT PAT! DO THE DARK SOUL
[4:35:26] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat i keep misreading his name as Shovel Knight
[4:35:27] <troxcree> I wish that spell of his wasn't so awful.
[4:35:28] <%mostundesired> He's pretty huge.
[4:35:31] <DraxTD> why now lag... why
[4:35:32] <Frozen_phoenix> he's a big boi
[4:35:34] <%deviljhojho94> THE DARK SOOOOUUUULL
[4:35:35] <extradopeness> dark souls is the dark souls of berserk
[4:35:37] <+sundizzle> @dukenux that implies berserk has an ending
[4:35:37] <lycandruid> the Crossbow Pog
[4:35:38] <%TheSpiritof2277> His meat is... pretty swollen
[4:35:38] <layssaltflavour> this music is so fucking good
[4:35:40] <%Remery_> See even the final boss uses a range weapon
[4:35:41] <dukenux> He's a 4 square boy
[4:35:42] <deadredeyez> is this the end of another run? woolieGASM
[4:35:42] <+ChaosVulpes> That GAPING BELLY WOUND is probably his weakpoint...
[4:35:42] <%terry_quest> kinda pointless to poise through a heal, wasting the estus
[4:35:43] <+iconoffilth> @mr_jumbles Souls make you huge. Just like Vedrick in DS2
[4:35:44] <romanticzomedy> HAX
[4:35:46] <%Sulliman34> NOTHIN PERSONEL KID
[4:35:49] <ThorW> Nothing Personnel kid

[4:35:50] <+MechaBaphomet> Nothing personal kid
[4:35:51] <%aishman> So @namillus it's two nobodies fighting at the edge of nothingness for no real reason
[4:35:51] <%0dokuro> Its implied Gael knew he couldnt handle the dark soul's power, so he wanted you to kill him to complete his quest.
[4:35:52] <+VanaSkiller> just like guys woulda done
[4:35:52] <shiny_prinny> nothing personnel kid

[4:37:22] <Burritomoose> look at this team
[4:37:24] <Squish_God> wait do people dislike Ringed city?
[4:37:24] <%Nobrev> buff your hammer
[4:37:31] <3xgilly> HeY wHeRe CaN i SkIp To ThE eNd??
[4:37:32] <%0dokuro> FOR YOUR DARK SOUL
[4:37:32] <%TeraMercier> This man moves like a JoJo
[4:37:33] <romanticzomedy> People who hate fun hate a lot of things
[4:37:33] <+Zxtole> No Ringed City is god like
[4:37:33] <%Jp3g95> For real though I would tune the fuck in to watch Pat play KOTOR 2
[4:37:34] <danknugglit> He knows he can use l2 without followup to buff right?
[4:37:36] <brambobelurkin> Na hes doing much better on Gael tbh
[4:37:38] <CastellanVon> The Sky goes completely black in phase 2.
[4:37:40] <+Grayhammatter> is this a jojo?
[4:37:40] <%superc37> eh, im not a fan of it tbh.
[4:37:44] <extradopeness> blue guts vs red guts who win
[4:37:45] <Lazershark2012> quick asf my guy
[4:37:47] <butchugger> Oh my god the arena is ds3 firelink
[4:37:49] <sjcodan> @danknugglit He knows, he's just a dumb
[4:37:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Now he’s motivated!
[4:37:54] <matrignomy7> oh hi Gail
[4:37:55] <%TeraMercier> @Jp3g95 Totally, he mentioned that he's more open to it last night
[4:37:56] <Idon__> KIENZAN
[4:37:57] <brambobelurkin> Does blue gutts have both arms?
[4:37:57] <CheekyBirb> ringed city is the best content in the game
[4:37:59] <%superc37> too many retcons and asspulls.
[4:38:00] <fireking900> part 2 of his theme is so good
[4:38:00] <%0dokuro> The Dark Soul is Gael's Stand
[4:38:01] <xeros720> next he should use his arm like a cannon
[4:38:02] <danknugglit> Thought so LUL
[4:38:02] <+iconoffilth> @mr_jumbles well, he ATE the Dark Souls from the pygmies. The Dark Soul is a Lord Soul just like Gwyns, The Witch, and Nito

[5:02:10] <%Prism_Wing> @london_flexing Hollow Knight
[5:02:11] <Rellim80> @cheekybirb Ashley is a Space Racist.
[5:02:12] <%TheSpiritof2277> Do combo

[5:02:18] <%Arxel1> 4. Do Combo
[5:02:18] <HyperBomb21> I honestly like Ashley a lot and her badness is greatly exaggerated
[5:02:19] <BaronVonDickButt> KOTOR WAS THE WORST GAME EVER (said no one ever)
[5:02:20] <%dimeybot> Hit. Don't get hit. Pizza.
[5:02:20] <%TeraMercier> The camera angles fuck me up
[5:02:20] <%ToxInjection> Be attractive don't be unattractive
[5:02:21] <TheChillRoom> @london_flexing Both are good, but Hollow Knight is probably objectively the better game? But also Dark Souls 2 is the only Dark Souls I revisit more than once a year
[5:02:21] <%MisterTylerrr> cheer500 I felt the same way about MonHun GenU but after a few missions I was right back into the swing of things. And that was at the beginning of Grank. So yea. I recommend giving it a try, would be more than happy to jump in with you.

[5:02:23] <+Codemaster7777> Sweet Red Dwarf
[5:02:23] <%ssjklyco> Best way to describe Ashely is pregenerated female character.
