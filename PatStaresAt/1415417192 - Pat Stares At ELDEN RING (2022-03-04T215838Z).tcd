[0:24:54] <lyzejag> No you have to get DEEP into it, don't worry about it until the big bad

[0:26:06] <%NarcissisticBrit> NarcissisticBrit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hell yeah! I'm loving this game so far!
[0:26:08] <MaritimeSpanker> Carmaan, huh
[0:26:09] <mrtanaka111> all that for a drop of perfume
[0:26:15] <%Brassnarwhal> read it?
[0:26:20] <TheDeimion> was that another secret path back there?
[0:26:25] <sirrice77> carmaan is one of the perfumers the guys that throw sparkly fire
[0:26:30] <TheDeimion> looked like there was another doorway in that hall
[0:26:30] <coziestbank> the perfume handbooks are all status breaths and stuff
[0:26:47] <jbrachob> Oh thats nice
[0:26:50] <MaritimeSpanker> HAH
[0:26:54] <Ghufufin> puppetmaster 17 all over again

[0:26:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Legendary Ashes
[0:26:56] <%topendbuzza> psaGiefrail
[0:26:58] <meatman_noplan> Because they're super special afaik
[0:26:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Gloom_Tangerine Rileigh was the name of a person Pat is supposed to kill
[0:27:01] <TheDeimion> hmmm maybe that's summoner lore
[0:27:01] <scrumbotime> Maybe there's a difference between an "ash" and a "puppet"
[0:27:02] <coziestbank> Ledgendary Summons different upgrade item
[0:27:05] <TwistParabola> yeah they're in a different section for some reason

[0:27:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh youll see Kappa
[0:27:18] <WeebFever> Lore difference between ashes and puppets for some reason
[0:27:19] <%Cozy90> there is one summon that might beat it :)
[0:27:23] <MaritimeSpanker> you were at it
[0:27:27] <MaritimeSpanker> by Oleg
[0:27:37] <scrumbotime> Like, ashes are dead people, puppets are soul puppets

[0:29:47] <coziestbank> You can look at the lava without going blind.

[0:30:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I just beat the game 20 minutes ago, btw
[0:30:23] <coziestbank> Did Blaidd make the coat out of his own hair?
[0:30:29] <MaritimeSpanker> The hell is patches doing in Volcano manor?
[0:30:32] <NewWillinium> Man that's a lot of crucified/hanged Giants
[0:30:33] <%RealThiele> full grown bullshit beast
[0:30:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @MaritimeSpanker He's part of Lady Tanith's faction.

[0:31:10] <WeebFever> went right around you lole
[0:31:12] <coziestbank> @MaritimeSpanker It's fucked up, but he actually has loyalty.
[0:31:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium the giants fought against the erdtree so they were not well liked on the holy mountain
[0:31:20] <TheDeimion> you could chase with your honse if you wanted LUL
[0:31:22] <+FlappySeal_> dragon breath it as it goes past, probably not gonna miss then
[0:31:29] <$realm_forge> It’s the horse all over again
[0:31:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:31:34] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> use pitta cutter or fire
[0:31:39] <toulon_somberjade> Yoooo
[0:31:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> pizza
[0:31:43] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[0:31:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium or if this mountain is on the fire side of the war they are likely the traitors who defended the tree
[0:31:50] <%geekjacob> pizza time
[0:31:56] <ALazo> chase on goat horse doesn't work?
[0:31:58] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal Wait so the Lendyl Knights are the one who strung them up?
[0:32:02] <$KishinGrek> nice sword, patwhat's it called
[0:32:02] <+croutonian> he does donuts up on the rock with the marionette
[0:32:04] <TheDeimion> Pat if you miss this time I'm gonna laugh at u so don't miss LUL
[0:32:22] <TheDeimion> nice
[0:32:29] <vVAstrAVv> cant you outpace these on horseback
[0:32:35] <$KishinGrek> Hand
[0:32:42] <whitebatsy> I usually just run at them with charged attack on horse
[0:32:45] <toulon_somberjade> How far is he?
[0:32:47] <MaritimeSpanker> wait
[0:32:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium i only have a few pieces of it I don't know that part, i just know about the schism in the giants and that the giants were the fire faction originally
[0:32:55] <%Maids4lyfe> Maids4lyfe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! hey loving the elden ring content, it's the most elden of streams
[0:32:56] <NBUsagi> I appreciate the 0 respect Pat has for his enemies
[0:32:59] <MaritimeSpanker> I thought Pat's sword did blackfire, not normal fire?
[0:33:02] <+ipaintwithcolor> man playing this game as a pure melee build is rooooough. its quite absurd how much harder it gets
[0:33:12] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Guys, I'm fuming. I fought one of the Great Jar Red Spirits that had the Meteoric Ore Blade katana, and it hit me with Ichimonji double with it. You can't change that weapon's ash as player, either.
[0:33:15] <jubejube56> NOPE
[0:33:36] <TheDeimion> maybe even just darts
[0:33:36] <+ipaintwithcolor> i mean i have a bow for like traps and stuff
[0:33:41] <%Valdorick> @MaritimeSpanker Enemies weak to fire have a special "i'm on fire animation" that doesn't take into account blackflame.
[0:33:41] <TheDeimion> even guts had darts
[0:33:50] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My dual wield greatswords has 1500+ attack rating
[0:33:50] <%MrMegaJackpots> yeah I respecced str/faith cuz pure str was just not fun
[0:33:50] <wolverinewaswrong> I wish I had a volcano manor
[0:33:54] <NBUsagi> Guts had a whole arm canon
[0:34:00] <lyzejag> Yeah, Greatsword only became almost impossible at the end with a few bosses
[0:34:01] <jacksawjack> And a cannon
[0:34:02] <+TAFK> PATCHES
[0:34:03] <toulon_somberjade> And a cannon
[0:34:05] <MaritimeSpanker> @Valdorick oh, neato
[0:34:06] <TheDeimion> guts had a lil GUN too just in case 4Head
[0:34:09] <%Axellogic> I accidently ended up clearing the whole mansion without realize how big a deal that was
[0:34:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @Fenrisulfr_V Meteoric ore blade has ichimonji as its charge attack
[0:34:14] <TheDeimion> sometimes you just need to shoot something
[0:34:14] <+ipaintwithcolor> but big sword hits hard
[0:34:22] <%grey_frank> This seems a happy place
[0:34:22] <@QueequegTheater> Pure melee is fine, I killed Mohg pretty easy with mimic chan
[0:34:23] <MaritimeSpanker> thass a hyuuuuge map
[0:34:25] <WeebFever> uh
[0:34:25] <fishmonger555> oh THATS why it's called the Volcano Manor!
[0:34:26] <rosabellamelantha> Hey Pat just beat the game decided to check how you're doing!
[0:34:31] <%dekkitout> Is that Mt gelmir or whats its name?
[0:34:31] <oda_flobunaga> Its passable, in parts
[0:34:32] <+lucky_icarus> @patstaresat Saw that Elden Ring video you retweeted. Fucking WILD dude
[0:34:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah that's how i got here
[0:34:39] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Monkeyweed21 Oh, I'm brain-damaged then lmao.
[0:34:47] <NewWillinium> I *Think* that you exit out of a cave mouth to the assassin fight
[0:34:50] <%sniffy77> Mt Gelmir you fight your way up to the summit
[0:34:52] <%cade_calrayn> There's a whole lot of fucking climbing involved in reaching it from the Plateau
[0:34:54] <+ipaintwithcolor> @QueequegTheater that friend does indeed help quite a bit. only summon him for duos or more though
[0:34:55] <%Brassnarwhal> thats how i got there
[0:34:58] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's been my off-hand katana this entire time while I use Moonveil in the main-hand.
[0:35:02] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> equipping mimic-chan with the pizza cutter the THE BEST
[0:35:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @Fenrisulfr_V its stupid good
[0:35:10] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> dual pizza time
[0:35:15] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Volcano manor people are assholes who knew
[0:35:22] <+chimaera24> They did say this guy ran an inquisition
[0:35:28] <Ravioli_Ronin> I just beat Godruck this morning; explored the map a little, but holy shit I didn’t expect the map to get that much bigger
[0:35:30] <%Axellogic> Did you ever get caught by the abducor's Pat?
[0:35:49] <%Axellogic> They take you here if you do
[0:35:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Snussy
[0:35:56] <MaritimeSpanker> He wanted the snussy
[0:35:56] <%dekkitout> Well, guess we found this game's Sens funhouse
[0:35:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yep, the godskins are actually snake people
[0:35:59] <Saltmeisterr> SNUSSY
[0:35:59] <%Valdorick> Oh god, its Lesser Dog
[0:36:03] <TheDeimion> snek FeelsBadMan
[0:36:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> taking the form of humans like rya
[0:36:09] <%Brassnarwhal> tough snek
[0:36:17] <TheNix> @Axellogic Yes he did
[0:36:17] <%luftraumm1> foreskinny?
[0:36:18] <meatman_noplan> This is honestly a pretty cool zone
[0:36:20] <%Crookedspiral> Is that The Sword of Longinus?
[0:36:20] <rosabellamelantha> this IS a legacy dungeon after all
[0:36:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> greg is ready tho
[0:36:22] <Halfsock> these snake things keep getting neater
[0:36:25] <+NeonFishFace> this is the most bloodborne
[0:36:36] <MaritimeSpanker> remember that the fat Godslayer had a tail, too!
[0:36:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Volcano Manor IS a legacy dungeon, so it makes sens ethat it's complex.
[0:36:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> adding the jump really let them go nuts with the level design
[0:36:39] <TwistParabola> (ocelot voice) SNAKEEEEE
[0:36:41] <%Valdorick> Get anti-aired
[0:36:45] <%Brassnarwhal> i was too slow on the bloodborne call
[0:36:49] <TheDeimion> can you try summoning the perfumer ?
[0:36:49] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> summon greg
[0:36:53] <WeebFever> Zombie dogs, the strongest of fromsoft enemies
[0:36:54] <Ravioli_Ronin> Get up in that Volcanussy
[0:36:54] <%Axellogic> This place is lava bloodborne

[0:37:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @ravioli_ronin i agree

[0:38:29] <TheDeimion> lol you almost got got
[0:38:31] <%Axellogic> I hate those things so much
[0:38:31] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the enemy designs in this game are SO GOOD
[0:38:35] <%holydeviant1> JESUS CHRIST where are you?!
[0:38:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...and hot
[0:38:38] <%Axellogic> They are so fucking tanky
[0:38:38] <%holydeviant1> I just got heree!
[0:38:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Forbidden fleshlights
[0:38:43] <%TheAdMerlin> Now THIS is a Yanrham
[0:38:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> ye
[0:38:50] <scrumbotime> I love how since they let you jump, legacy dungeons have STUPID amounts of weird side shit to jump to
[0:38:51] <%twohitgood> sounds like a scarab nearby
[0:38:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @holydeviant1 holy mountain
[0:38:53] <MaritimeSpanker> sure do
[0:38:55] <toulon_somberjade> Yup
[0:38:55] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[0:38:56] <TheDeimion> I've heard that iff you die by that grab they take you somewhere
[0:38:58] <%VictorVonLouche> Quick warning do all the Manor requests first before beating the boss of this zone, just had them leave the manor.
[0:38:59] <TwistParabola> follow your ears
[0:39:00] <%Axellogic> Its on one of the roofs I think
[0:39:02] <%quantras6> How many demigods has he killed?
[0:39:14] <%quantras6> Also what is that sweet armor set
[0:39:18] <%Monkeyweed21> @TheDeimion thats true for at least one of them
[0:39:21] <toulon_somberjade> It's the tingly that sets off my "where the fuck is it" triggers
[0:39:34] <NewWillinium> I'm finding these Snake dudes to be very very cute for some reason
[0:39:35] <TheDeimion> neat
[0:39:37] <%holydeviant1> ...How *do* you get there? I just hit the capitol, I would like to try some other place than here
[0:39:39] <%Valdorick> Later fucko
[0:39:44] <coziestbank> @TheDeimion It's the one in Raya, and it takes you to the Ass-End of Mt. Gelmier in the most elaborate Patches trick yet.
[0:39:47] <%Brassnarwhal> lightning good on snek?
[0:39:55] <WeebFever> gettin stinkbombed
[0:39:57] <jubejube56> Oh god snake martial arts
[0:40:02] <Parapattern> Snake man. A Snan.
[0:40:05] <TwistParabola> he's walkin ere
[0:40:05] <tanarath> this is a bloodborne
[0:40:19] <%cade_calrayn> beware the forbidden snussy
[0:40:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @holydeviant1 go north to altus plateau run past the dragon then go west til you hit the mountain
[0:40:35] <TheDeimion> they really like their perfume here
[0:40:38] <%Axellogic> I'm surprised I clear this area before you conisdering how much more youve played
[0:40:42] <TheDeimion> so stinky
[0:40:51] <%quantras6> How many of the demigod bosses has he killed chat?
[0:40:53] <%knowing_of_then> knowing_of_then subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[0:40:54] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Chub snake
[0:40:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @axellogic he went to caelid first instead
[0:41:25] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @quantras6 technically 2 since rennala isn't a demigod despite holding a rune
[0:41:29] <shootybooty1> sekiro looks weird
[0:41:32] <%Axellogic> @Brassnarwhal I mean ive been extremely aimless and cant commit to any areas
[0:41:37] <sirrice77> @quantras6 godric, rennala, radahn
[0:41:50] <%holydeviant1> @Brassnarwhal I mean, I been to the mountain, but there was no city, just the Volcano manor
[0:42:00] <%quantras6> dammit I wanted to see radahn
[0:42:04] <%quantras6> Thanks anyway
[0:42:17] <+pectusumbra> Yo, cool cape!
[0:42:19] <sirrice77> radahn was like 2 streams ago right at the end
[0:42:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> Kappa
[0:42:27] <%mythcreant> hm
[0:42:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:42:35] <mrtanaka111> you lamed him out surely
[0:42:36] <%dekkitout> Sweet
[0:42:37] <%mythcreant> gun did go up
[0:42:39] <NewWillinium> The funny thing is that Pat *really* isn't lying.
[0:42:41] <kingmemelord97> Kappa
[0:42:44] <%quantras6> Yeah but I could fight him with potbro
[0:42:44] <Overloard> G A T AQUIRED
[0:42:44] <%Valdorick> They didn't know about Rotdan
[0:42:45] <%topendbuzza> says level 70 pat
[0:42:51] <+AyupaPupa> Didn’t expect weak enemy…
[0:42:52] <%Kevlar_Caviar> to be fair you did him pretty late and also used scarlet rot a shitton
[0:42:54] <%quantras6> And that's the wolfguys set right?
[0:42:57] <%Axellogic> I also had a fairly easy time with Radahn
[0:42:58] <+Shikari21> not all of us cheese it with rot smh my head
[0:42:59] <vVAstrAVv> pat had even MORE bullshit
[0:43:02] <+omegasis> so is the weapon art for Pat's GS not that great?
[0:43:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> but hey a win's a win
[0:43:03] <TwistParabola> Radahn wasn't tough for me personally, like third try or something
[0:43:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @holydeviant1 follow the prism stones off the main path
[0:43:13] <%Monkeyweed21> too many people try to do Radahn as an honest 1 on 1 melee fight
[0:43:16] <%Valdorick> Scarlet Rot is for sure going to be the meta on SR1 runs
[0:43:19] <NBUsagi> Telling from the walking torture robots, this place must have ruled 0w 0
[0:43:20] <kingmemelord97> vore maiden
[0:43:27] <%Valdorick> Rot the boss then bleed/frostbite
[0:43:35] <%Axellogic> Toughest part of radahn for me was just the start with the auto tracking arrows
[0:43:36] <TheDeimion> you know what this damage reminds me of? wheel skeletons
[0:43:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Monkeyweed21 summoning is for scrubs and cheater Kappa
[0:43:45] <%holydeviant1> @Brassnarwhal ...That leads to seethewater
[0:43:45] <Happydisaster> Radahn seems like a sort of gimmick boss, where you’d want the summons
[0:43:46] <partyshart> Pats attack looks cooler but the evil marionette thing is still winning on style
[0:43:49] <WeebFever> The amount of sparks coming off of them is quite concerning
[0:43:49] <%Kevlar_Caviar> SL1 runs are gonna be the toughest they've ever been
[0:43:51] <jubejube56> I can’t believe in lore that radahn got cheesed by scarlet rot smh
[0:43:52] <%Axellogic> If they had less health
[0:43:55] <AgnusLaplace> "try"
[0:43:55] <kinkade_77> what sacred seal are you using?
[0:43:56] <+Your_heals> jeeeeeeesus
[0:43:56] <TheDeimion> oh no ded
[0:43:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @kingmemelord97 bdsm maiden, vore is different
[0:44:01] <+FlappySeal_> F
[0:44:06] <TwistParabola> F
[0:44:11] <+NeonFishFace> there's some crazy mfers out there tho, they can sure try
[0:44:16] <Ravioli_Ronin> GRRM: “ok so there’s these killer automatons with poison-coochie”
[0:44:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @kinkade_77 bestial seal from the beast church
[0:44:17] <TwistParabola> i mean, they'll be possible
[0:44:22] <%twohitgood> dist and lobos both still seem set on doing sl1
[0:44:24] <Overloard> after several tries at radahn i managed to stumble upon a AI glitch and i smacked him through phase 2
[0:44:26] <mrtanaka111> someone soloed with wretch already
[0:44:26] <%VictorVonLouche> Soul lvl 1 runs are impossible, some bosses auto hit you.
[0:44:27] <TheDeimion> lol neck go long
[0:44:29] <+omegasis> is the weapon art on Pat's GS not that good? or just his incantations are alot better?
[0:44:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Fyi you can use the breaths attacks while riding, just not the named ones
[0:44:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i thin k it's possible if you skip certain bosses, it'll still be real fucked though
[0:44:37] <%Monkeyweed21> level 1 runs are incredibly feasible given how much upgrades matter
[0:44:38] <NBUsagi> LV1 runs a possible but probably just not fun
[0:44:48] <%Valdorick> Apparently a mandatory boss has an unavoidable room wide AoE, but then again, the Physic lets you eat one attack, doesn't it.
[0:44:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @omegasis it's incredibly slow but does good damage
[0:44:54] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @omegasis It's REALLY slow but does incredible damage.
[0:44:56] <TheDeimion> I straight up thought that was an earth worm monster until you attacked that long boi
[0:45:00] <retrosadness> the souls challenge community will find a way
[0:45:30] <TheDeimion> blugeon damage is probably a better option
[0:45:33] <%Axellogic> I've not found anything that hurts these things consistently
[0:45:37] <coziestbank> Are there any broken weapon arts accessible at starting class levels?
[0:45:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Has Pat increased his Vigor at all since yesterday's stream?
[0:45:42] <partyshart> yo there's snake heads in there this thing is fucked
[0:45:42] <Overloard> if only queen renalla let you relocate ALL of your stats
[0:45:44] <%Valdorick> I just can wait for the Speedruns myself. Because fuck them if they become "just go under the ground and melee things under the earth!"
[0:45:44] <TheDeimion> can you block it maybe?
[0:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> DOOR STUCK
[0:45:52] <Parapattern> Shield would probably be useful
[0:45:52] <jubejube56> Well you can summon here if you wanted a “better way”
[0:45:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank blood slash from fort haight
[0:45:56] <mrtanaka111> just ignore then
[0:45:58] <%geekjacob> @Fenrisulfr_V yes
[0:46:06] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> The bacon on the inside
[0:46:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> orb stuck
[0:46:08] <ebrion> Hitting the open doors seems to do more
[0:46:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Jump attacks are really good on the flesh parts
[0:46:25] <coziestbank> @Brassnarwhal yeah I figured Bleed would be a heavy part of the damage side
[0:46:26] <Happydisaster> Interesting the machine seems to be full of snakes.
[0:46:32] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Valdorick I mean, you realistically only have to kill, what, five or six bosses to get the default ending?
[0:46:33] <TheDeimion> oh LORD
[0:46:33] <toulon_somberjade> I got fucked over by a message by a ladder that lost me 24k souls
[0:46:33] <%Axellogic> Youd want a barricade great sheild for those guys they do way too much stamina damage
[0:46:38] <+pectusumbra> Now that's a nice grab
[0:46:38] <Parapattern> Mouthful Mode
[0:46:38] <%Valdorick> Are we really suggesting that Pat "hits it in the back"?
[0:46:45] <Happydisaster> More snake iconography
[0:46:49] <TheDeimion> that's not even accumulative it's just POISONED
[0:46:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank the blood slash can like 4 shot half of the early bosses
[0:46:55] <NewWillinium> Ooooooh
[0:46:57] <sid_jcol> get chomped
[0:47:02] <kinkade_77> use soap
[0:47:03] <+Cecrios> Slave Knight Gael cosplay
[0:47:03] <%dekkitout> Honestly, it looks better
[0:47:04] <coziestbank> Kind of want to make a Madness build with a 2nd person and just use the focus raising tailsmans to outlast opponents on buildup
[0:47:06] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick If it saves time, Speed Runners will, as is their nature, use any terrible to watch tactic possible.
[0:47:09] <+EternalInquisitor> Why does all of the gameplay I've seen of this look like enemies have just way, way too much health?
[0:47:10] <%Axellogic> You can also just walk around the roofs to avoid him
[0:47:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank you don't even need to take the bleed scaling just the art
[0:47:17] <TheDeimion> oh becauese of the blood
[0:47:22] <%gitgouda> well thats a thing
[0:47:23] <%TaurusOxford> nomnom nom
[0:47:24] <%Valdorick> The No OOBs speed runs will be bonkers though, I'm sure.
[0:47:26] <TheDeimion> that's pretty whicked actually LUL
[0:47:30] <%gitgouda> NOICE
[0:47:33] <adithehella> good plan
[0:47:33] <Parapattern> LUL
[0:47:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> good plan
[0:47:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @EternalInquisitor because you can summon ghost lads to help you
[0:47:37] <NBUsagi> can not stand inf front of those things
[0:47:39] <$realm_forge> This zone is fucking cool
[0:47:39] <%holydeviant1> Is there a use for the crystal tear that makes you explode
[0:47:42] <+The_EL_Destino> try dodging
[0:47:44] <WeebFever> pat it's already in hell
[0:47:44] <%gitgouda> that was nuts
[0:47:45] <%Axellogic> YOu did it
[0:47:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @EternalInquisitor they really, really dont, Pat is using a fire sword in the lava zone right now
[0:47:47] <ebrion> Geometry!
[0:47:49] <KasiCrafter> Sssssip Physic
[0:47:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank I'm definitely trying to go madness route, do you know where i can find the eye laser thing?
[0:48:01] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @holydeviant1 i presume for getting buffs that only activate at low health
[0:48:02] <+EternalInquisitor> @Monkeyweed21 Sounds about Pat.
[0:48:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Valdorick That's why I either go for glitchless runs or runs that have funny glitches. The Tear any% runs for DS3 were cancerous, though.
[0:48:07] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[0:48:13] <mrtanaka111> no chill
[0:48:13] <coziestbank> @holydeviant1 fuck you when assisting against invader, trigger tearstone-like effects
[0:48:20] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick Yuuuuuuuuuuup
[0:48:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh wait i replied to the wrong chat LUL
[0:48:36] <%Axellogic> dog
[0:48:45] <%Kevlar_Caviar> twitch's reply thing is fucked
[0:48:49] <+FattimusSlime> Are the frame hitches the game or the stream?
[0:48:51] <$realm_forge> I love this game but also hate it because there’s so many weapons I wanna make props of. Every time I see it there’s something new!!
[0:48:54] <%Axellogic> Talis
[0:49:04] <Overloard> every time i see those iron maidens "try ranged battle" or "time fore running"
[0:49:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank if you put explode before heal it does damage and heale it back I'm pretty sure
[0:49:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @realm_forge there's a sword in endgame that i desperately need a replica of
[0:49:20] <coziestbank> @Brassnarwhal The two Frenzy related locations in Lake get you incantations, NW of the village gets you a great spear with native/weapon art
[0:49:22] <%Niney_Who> He's literally Capra Demon
[0:49:24] <%Axellogic> Beware of dog
[0:49:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> what about his nuts?
[0:49:28] <MaritimeSpanker> sadly, I must go and do the sleep. Looking forwards to the VOD later
[0:49:29] <lockhead45> Is this the capital? came in late today
[0:49:29] <%Valdorick> Oh, its an Omen Killer
[0:49:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank so you should be able to be creative
[0:49:37] <Overloard> damn dudde dodged the lightning
[0:49:42] <%Brassnarwhal> @lockhead45 holy mountain
[0:49:59] <lockhead45> Thanks
[0:50:02] <adithehella> youch
[0:50:09] <$realm_forge> @kevlar_caviar that godslayer pat is using now NEEDS to go on my wall at some point
[0:50:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[0:50:13] <AngryAsian5> AHHHHHH
[0:50:15] <coziestbank> @Brassnarwhal Most of the madness stuff builds on you as well so I think some buffs to Focus are required to use well
[0:50:16] <%Axellogic> pat heal
[0:50:17] <+NeonFishFace> well now you have lots of time to read that
[0:50:20] <Overloard> i remember finding that guy in liurnia and coming back 50 levels later to stomp him
[0:50:20] <+FlappySeal_> Jesus pat LUL
[0:50:23] <KasiCrafter> That was 10000% on you Pat
[0:50:24] <%luftraumm1> why not heal
[0:50:28] <lethallylactic> Your health sir...
[0:50:31] <+pectusumbra> You thought you were safe

[0:50:34] <+The_EL_Destino> he threw pissball at you
[0:50:35] <%luftraumm1> why you no heal
[0:50:41] <meatman_noplan> I rocked that axe for a long time

[0:50:55] <vVAstrAVv> pat you refil your fp when its half full but will sit on 1hp
[0:51:09] <tanarath> Pat, are you doing a frighten?
[0:51:12] <%luftraumm1> tou never safe gief os always prowling
[0:51:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> guys, is the adjective for being afflicted with Blood Loss "blood lossed" or "blood lost"
[0:51:30] <%Monkeyweed21> blood lost
[0:51:32] <KasiCrafter> The former
[0:51:39] <coziestbank> @Kevlar_Caviar hemorrhaged
[0:51:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh no...
[0:51:54] <%Monkeyweed21> im 80% sure lossed isnt a real word
[0:52:03] <jubejube56> Oh this is that Capra demon from earlier
[0:52:05] <tanarath> Poor Zangief
[0:52:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> blood loss'd then
[0:52:12] <+Based_Moose> Gief was almost insulted
[0:52:18] <NBUsagi> Gief was like "what i do?"
[0:52:26] <%gitgouda> so did anyone else lose their character after the cloud sync?
[0:52:29] <+hakumaribo> does Gief get super upset when you call him a bad dog? Mine does, he throws a fit.
[0:52:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> or blorst
[0:52:35] <WeebFever> the stinky bomb guys are the most dangerous enemies here
[0:52:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @coziestbank I'll keep it in mind, are there consumables that reduce madness buildup?
[0:52:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> blood unfound
[0:52:48] <%Axellogic> dog
[0:52:54] <mrtanaka111> say that again
[0:52:58] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @gitgouda what recovery option did you choose in the steam popup, cloud or local file?
[0:53:00] <%mythcreant> that was a sound
[0:53:01] <%Deft_Thought> The hell was that scream
[0:53:04] <+hakumaribo> @gitgouda yeah i did, i have to start over

[0:54:03] <coziestbank> @Brassnarwhal I think 33 Faith is the req for the strongest incantation involving it, great spear needs decent str and dex I think
[0:54:09] <roguemephilesclone> psaJpeg
[0:54:35] <WeebFever> That iron virgin always does that attack out of the gate and ignores you after if you're not in line of sight
[0:54:48] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat hey pat trying to figure out this ashes system, if I put a bleed art on my sword does make the R1s do bleed build up as well?
[0:54:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> just saw a claim that killing radahn after clearing this area's boss makes the meteorite land somewhere else, is that true or bullshit?

[0:55:47] <%luftraumm1> did you know you can play as Luigi in mario 64?
[0:55:47] <+CatRidder> RUN AWAY
[0:55:51] <%VictorVonLouche> BUT beating this zones boss will make the manor Npc's go away
[0:56:02] <%Cozy90> its ewasier to ruuuuuun!
[0:56:06] <%Brassnarwhal> mew is under the moving truck you just gotta push
[0:56:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> could you imagine if they made that whole ass zone and it was completely missable
[0:56:15] <+pectusumbra> I wonder if the other one doesn't activate while the first one is aggro on you?
[0:56:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @VictorVonLouche yeah THAT'S true
[0:56:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @cozy90 i appreciate your reference
[0:56:24] <doggettxalex> poggers

[0:56:51] <%Niney_Who> I love these snake guys
[0:57:14] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[0:57:15] <+pectusumbra> Don't those robots hate lightning?
[0:57:19] <%G_476> the second one was coming down the stairs, huh
[0:57:25] <+CatRidder> just run away pat
[0:57:26] <%Axellogic> They suck ass
[0:57:27] <vVAstrAVv> these sneks are really cute imo
[0:57:27] <%Nekros4442> yeah i just run from iron maidens lol
[0:57:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> fun fact: the model for the snake people from ds3 is in the files for this game, presumably as a placeholder for these dudes
[0:57:28] <%sniffy77> you do a bunch of damage if you hit the inside of those when the tentacles come out
[0:57:30] <%Brassnarwhal> best iteration of snake men in ds so far
[0:57:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> have you accepted pope dog turtle into your life?
[0:57:39] <DetectiveLink> What lvl is pat?
[0:57:41] <doggettxalex> missing out on jumping on the rooftops
[0:57:45] <+ipaintwithcolor> i employ the ancient strategy of being a coward versus these
[0:57:49] <Ner234> These snakes are kinda cute yeah
[0:57:51] <coziestbank> Does blunt work on them?
[0:57:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're real pat
[0:57:53] <Guardiansaiyan> real Pat?!
[0:57:57] <The_Murray_Carp> Saint Anger?
[0:57:59] <+Beetlewins> found out today that the avionette ashes are surprisingly good. They're so erratic in their patterns that bosses just can't handle them
[0:58:01] <%luftraumm1> Pope dog turtle is the best
[0:58:03] <Guardiansaiyan> is he?
[0:58:11] <NewWillinium> Cheesing them through a cracked gate with the Magic Greatbow. Only sanity saving way
[0:58:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> fake pat is greg
[0:58:18] <%EternaPurple> Pat isn't real
[0:58:19] <%Brassnarwhal> they seem to be designed to make you run past them
[0:58:26] <%Axellogic> Rooftops are infact safer and you can just walk around and drop behind the gate instead of the middle
[0:58:29] <+Ravenian96> It's his house
[0:58:36] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I'm fuming.
[0:58:50] <%luftraumm1> hate their little feetsies
[0:58:50] <%Mister_McDerp> no step on snek
[0:58:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Flasks cap out at 14 charges, so I can't do my 10-5 allocation anymore.
[0:58:57] <+Beetlewins> that might be the dumbest looking Souls monster ever
[0:59:10] <+Ravenian96> yep 14 hard cap
[0:59:17] <%Axellogic> You gonna get that item you missed?
[0:59:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats wack
[0:59:33] <%Brassnarwhal> it's a 3d model of those memes of drawing arms on snakes
[0:59:41] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Oh, Pat, tip. Lava does, like, no damage in this game.
[0:59:44] <%CoffeeKaiju> those are lanky bois
[0:59:58] <doggettxalex> did they literally make you walk around the side to open the door?
[1:00:06] <+anoldtoilet> lol the ds3 sword
[1:00:06] <Kain5707> or just makes your slow and tickles you
[1:00:11] <Kain5707> it
[1:00:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> albinaurics?
[1:00:17] <+anoldtoilet> damn those are some high damage bolts.
[1:00:26] <adithehella> oh those are bloodborne
[1:00:30] <%Brassnarwhal> except the lava from the lava wyrm, that guy's lava is nutty
[1:00:35] <%Axellogic> Welcome to bloodbourne
[1:00:43] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Howdy Pat, spent a few hours grinding out various knight armor sets. So far the Cuckoo Knights of Raya Lucaria look the best.
[1:00:44] <%Cozy90> time for cowardice
[1:00:54] <%CoffeeKaiju> these are the slime students
[1:00:58] <adithehella> aaaaaah
[1:01:01] <adithehella> oh god
[1:01:02] <+ipaintwithcolor> those guys are gross
[1:01:02] <+anoldtoilet> nice grab.

[1:01:17] <+Beetlewins> what the fuck are those

[1:01:18] <tanarath> Getting fucked up in the crib
[1:01:19] <Kain5707> welcome to the clocktower
[1:01:21] <%Axellogic> Welcome to instant kill grabs
[1:01:24] <kingmemelord97> wait thats just the monster form the bloodborne dlc
[1:01:24] <+Ravenian96> Reading lore on the Albinaurics is really confusing, I don't really understand WHAT they are
[1:01:24] <+pectusumbra> They remind me of the guys with the big heads from the painted world
[1:01:35] <+pectusumbra> the ones that burst into toxic on death
[1:01:43] <luciluxlu0> @ipaintwithcolor you don't know the half of it
[1:01:49] <+anoldtoilet> i assume this is the volcano manor i heard about
[1:01:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @ravenian96 the second generation ones have "Dumpy Frog Heads"
[1:01:59] <kinkade_77> so glad they made important items purple
[1:02:10] <+ipaintwithcolor> @luciluxlu0 the one advantage of being full melee i suppose..
[1:02:19] <WeebFever> you have to backwards long jump
[1:02:23] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Why is it always dog?
[1:02:29] <ape_hawk> try horsee?
[1:02:31] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Horse?
[1:02:32] <doggettxalex> triple jump
[1:02:32] <Kain5707> Pat is going to live the boss weapon from this area
[1:02:32] <%vance168> think ya need a running start?
[1:02:33] <+anoldtoilet> yopu can totally just stand on that ledge
[1:02:34] <tanarath> side of the building?
[1:02:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> roof
[1:02:37] <%Axellogic> Run jump might make it
[1:02:37] <%Crookedspiral> jump it!
[1:02:37] <luciluxlu0> you get it later I guess
[1:02:37] <sirrice77> No you can jump
[1:02:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ?
[1:02:39] <%Brassnarwhal> try jumping
[1:02:40] <+livi242> it did for me
[1:02:40] <+burntwing> torent double jump
[1:02:41] <KasiCrafter> Maybe drop from the roof?
[1:02:43] <STORMWIZARD1> horse jump?
[1:02:45] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:02:48] <Kalarchis> horse double jump?
[1:02:53] <NBUsagi> also holy shit they made the music like 10x more foreboding in this game
[1:02:55] <%Brassnarwhal> horse is off i think
[1:02:59] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Can't summon horse here.
[1:02:59] <doggettxalex> i don't think he can get on torrent here
[1:03:00] <luciluxlu0> I think I got it but I forgot when. or how
[1:03:01] <%luftraumm1> roof seems too high
[1:03:02] <mrtanaka111> stop dying
[1:03:04] <ape_hawk> can you not horse here?
[1:03:05] <KasiCrafter> Pat
[1:03:06] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Its the welcoming committee
[1:03:09] <+ipaintwithcolor> no horse here
[1:03:10] <AngryAsian5> Goddamn
[1:03:10] <%Brassnarwhal> up required ahead
[1:03:12] <%Mister_McDerp> wow
[1:03:14] <tanarath> Pat, can you walk along the side of the roof?
[1:03:17] <+ipaintwithcolor> no horse in legacy dungeons
[1:03:24] <+Ravenian96> Silent except for bosses
[1:03:29] <Kain5707> @patstaresat have you found the 2nd underground area yet, don't want to say much but holy shit there's a lot
[1:03:31] <mrtanaka111> ds3 had like 5 good musics
[1:03:32] <tanarath> well, the side of the building with the tiny lip
[1:03:36] <WeebFever> Bosses and hubs
[1:03:41] <%notsoy> ds1 firelink shrine says hi
[1:03:43] <%boggsz12> adjudicator's theme from original demon's souls is my favorite theme in the series though
[1:03:51] <NBUsagi> Huh, your right
[1:03:52] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt theres was a cloud save problem for the pc version that erased a lot of peoples progress, ive been forced to start over after 70 hours.
[1:04:02] <%twohitgood> I wonder if the addition of incidental music is making some people like the games more?
[1:04:07] <$realm_forge> Bloodbourne has some real bangers tho
[1:04:12] <+Ravenian96> Oof it only fucked my last 10 hours
[1:04:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> yikes
[1:04:13] <%Axellogic> its just run jumping
[1:04:16] <tanarath> WOW
[1:04:18] <+ipaintwithcolor> whelp im backing up my save now
[1:04:21] <+HaloIsA> YEP that happened to me last night
[1:04:28] <cavefishes> if you see that cloud popup you just have to click the newer version of the save
[1:04:32] <+Shikari21> It almost happened to me
[1:04:35] <%Mister_McDerp> pc master race LUL
[1:04:37] <+livi242> I disabled the cloud saves
[1:04:39] <Kain5707> oh that's good better backup my 100 hours now Jesus
[1:04:40] <%epide> yeah i lost a whole zone of progress but oddly it still saved my place and the boss is was at
[1:04:41] <toulon_somberjade> I DODGED THAT PROBLEM
[1:04:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Its just steam fucking up and using an old cloud save again, you just have to choose the local save
[1:04:42] <%boggsz12> i have never been so thankful for my jank ass old xbox one that can somehow run this game
[1:04:42] <cavefishes> it was fine for me but if you mislick goodbye to progress
[1:04:45] <mantyz> yeah a had the same problem :C 12h lost
[1:04:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt it's because steam tells them that the cloud and local saves aren't synced and they automatically choose to use the cloud save without checking which one is more recent
[1:04:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you just need to be sure to pick the newer save
[1:04:55] <+DrFacilier> Jesus fuck I would cry I'm at 70hours in
[1:05:02] <cavefishes> yeah this is a "people not reading the prompt" problem
[1:05:04] <ReenBenkyou> mando
[1:05:09] <doggettxalex> that's absolutely gonna kill u
[1:05:13] <toulon_somberjade> YUP
[1:05:14] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> use jetpack
[1:05:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @justtheguyyouneed i picked the newer save and still lost progress
[1:05:17] <+livi242> just do a running jump Pat
[1:05:19] <tanarath> It should be
[1:05:20] <sirrice77> You're supposed to run and jump
[1:05:21] <%gitgouda> moving after jumping in place is a thing
[1:05:23] <+tizziks> rainboe stone?
[1:05:23] <%tetraes> always use local save
[1:05:24] <KasiCrafter> Drop a sonte?
[1:05:24] <%Axellogic> You literally just sprint jump pat why are you so scared
[1:05:24] <cavefishes> yeah it is possible but theres another way to get there
[1:05:27] <+pectusumbra> Try cat ring?
[1:05:28] <@Spydurman> horse?
[1:05:30] <%luftraumm1> looks too high
[1:05:32] <coziestbank> @PatStaresAt It literally askes you whether you want to use the cloud or local save when it happens with really clear timestamps.
[1:05:34] <+Alvarado94> Torrent
[1:05:44] <%Brassnarwhal> use soft cotton from top
[1:05:44] <Kain5707> LUL
[1:05:49] <%gitgouda> lol
[1:05:51] <NewWillinium> You can't Torrent in here
[1:05:51] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:05:52] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> huh
[1:05:55] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> weak ass lava
[1:05:58] <%CoffeeKaiju> flashback to starfox 64
[1:05:59] <%gitgouda> ahhh my tootsies
[1:06:00] <%Axellogic> You have to face the right way though
[1:06:01] <WeebFever> ow ouch owie ow
[1:06:02] <%boggsz12> oh
[1:06:02] <%Valdorick> Wow, we're into World of Warcraft Lava
[1:06:02] <+CatRidder> try finger
[1:06:03] <%twohitgood> this is really gentle lava.
[1:06:04] <luciluxlu0> I just got it by falling but it didn't feel right
[1:06:05] <%Brassnarwhal> geometry fucked
[1:06:05] <NewWillinium> Lava ain't what it used to be
[1:06:07] <+livi242> foot massage lava
[1:06:07] <cavefishes> warm toes
[1:06:09] <%luftraumm1> clipped something there
[1:06:09] <dds333a> No, it is noy
[1:06:09] <%CoffeeKaiju> what the hell is this just hot soup
[1:06:12] <mrtanaka111> lost a item
[1:06:13] <Druss_M> Weak ass lava
[1:06:13] <%shootbang_exe> not your daddy's lava
[1:06:13] <doggettxalex> lmao let me just wander through this lava
[1:06:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Brassnarwhal That's a bummer then, i got the same problem and picking the newer one put   me right back where i was
[1:06:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> shits barely even molten
[1:06:16] <MavMedic81> Survivable from the roof
[1:06:17] <+tavian99> That is a “this is fine” walk lol
[1:06:18] <+TDotGoat> slightly warm lava
[1:06:18] <%Brassnarwhal> it did a lot when he rolled
[1:06:19] <AngryAsian5> Dollar General Lava
[1:06:21] <vVAstrAVv> IT'S WEAKER THAN ROT
[1:06:28] <+Double_Tap_That> More like a spicy swamp than a pool of lava.
[1:06:28] <+Ravenian96> Lava is kinda like super hot glue in this game
[1:06:31] <%Valdorick> I mean, the gasses near that lava alone should be killing you
[1:06:32] <$realm_forge> Do you think game characters actually feel pain?
[1:06:33] <+pectusumbra> O-kay
[1:06:34] <%G_476> might be your fire sword
[1:06:36] <meatman_noplan> Or be hit with fire specifically
[1:06:39] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Rot is stronger than LAVCA
[1:06:44] <dds333a> The classic slash sound effect LUL
[1:06:49] <WeebFever> These are special jars called fire jars, there's some normal jars among them
[1:06:54] <%Saadi90> When using fire I think
[1:06:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @justtheguyyouneed yeah it was annoying but i just had to re defeat a boss
[1:07:12] <kinkade_77> godslayer magic> everything else
[1:07:23] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> PotFriend
[1:07:31] <%Valdorick> Mmmm... Raw Meat Dumpling
[1:07:35] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> all the small shields suck so far
[1:07:41] <dds333a> What a construction LUL
[1:07:48] <%Valdorick> Even worse than the Bloodborne Shield?
[1:07:51] <tanarath> looks cool, though
[1:07:53] <cavefishes> shield? you mean equippable item description LUL
[1:07:53] <%greasypete00> small shields are only good for parrying
[1:07:56] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Jars are chill
[1:08:06] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> they did
[1:08:12] <%boggsz12> wow lol
[1:08:17] <+Double_Tap_That> Wasn't there a shield that increased the damage you took in one of the games?
[1:08:30] <%discoinfierno> The game is so nice to the players and I think that's good, actually
[1:08:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> bustin
[1:08:40] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Not dropping you into lava is the From Soft equivalent of a break
[1:08:44] <cavefishes> well jumped
[1:08:50] <Tenebrae94> i got here an hour late did i miss anything?
[1:08:51] <%luftraumm1> souls easy mode /s
[1:08:51] <dds333a> Fire wall with Pat again
[1:08:52] <coziestbank> backstep
[1:08:52] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Have you guys noticed how certain specific upgrade mats are much rarer than others? I've got tons of every Somber Smithing Stone besides 3 and 4.
[1:08:53] <%vance168> They reaaaaally want you to running start round here
[1:08:54] <%Valdorick> Teleport to a grace
[1:08:57] <%boggsz12> i'm shocked it doesn't at least stagger you
[1:08:57] <+TDotGoat> New Lando Lava park
[1:08:57] <%Valdorick> instead of dying in the lava
[1:08:59] <tanarath> rip souls
[1:09:00] <mrtanaka111> this is fine
[1:09:00] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> knife quickstep works in lava
[1:09:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @Tenebrae94 nope
[1:09:11] <coziestbank> You can backstep or you movement weapons arts through goop
[1:09:11] <%Axellogic> What sucks is your souls can end up inside the lava
[1:09:13] <%cade_calrayn> that death scream is perfect
[1:09:13] <%Bailey__Gaming> needs a thumbs up as you collapse into the lava
[1:09:13] <NBUsagi> One does not simply walk into Mordor
[1:09:14] <luciluxlu0> I swear i am at a part I am not supposed to be at but my summon is carrying me
[1:09:16] <+CatRidder> you need to jump like elmo
[1:09:21] <dds333a> More of the Manor LUL
[1:09:24] <senfood> just like the Terminator
[1:09:24] <vVAstrAVv> that's hilarious lol
[1:09:35] <cavefishes> @Fenrisulfr_V the upgrade drops are based on area, so if you've done stuff out of "order" you might have way more late game mats than mid-game
[1:10:00] <%Axellogic> Pat will never get the run jump item will he
[1:10:03] <+Ravenian96> yeah i had a +9 special weapon really early
[1:10:05] <doggettxalex> how much more of the game is there if this isn't late game
[1:10:06] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> that happened to me. I had 16 Smithing Stones 4 before I had enough 3s
[1:10:10] <%greasypete00> it feels like everything after raya lucaria feels like endgame but theres still so much
[1:10:11] <cavefishes> my sword was stuck at +5 for the longest time despite having somber stones up to +9 ahaha
[1:10:11] <+anoldtoilet> yeah i was wandering around in caelid way too early
[1:10:13] <%Valdorick> I remember having all the mats to take 3 spirits to +10...
[1:10:14] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cavefishes I mean, I've completed the game by now. Done basically every side area, too.
[1:10:18] <%Valdorick> ... but didn't have a +4 item
[1:10:18] <niffinbox> finish the blaidd quest thing yet?
[1:10:35] <@QueequegTheater> @doggettxalex lmao this is like Sen's Fortress
[1:10:41] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> yea he got the armor

[1:14:09] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> @Nekros4442 I'd say the flail is also kinda OP
[1:14:18] <luciluxlu0> there's two bosses
[1:14:21] <PenguinPall> Just don't kill the boss
[1:14:26] <niffinbox> @cavefishes buying game now

[1:14:28] <+livi242> I did this boss and could do the questline I think
[1:14:32] <+Ravenian96> I wouldn't worry about it
[1:14:33] <cavefishes> @tri3dgE027 plip plop
[1:14:37] <+pectusumbra> these things all having white blood is kind of awful
[1:14:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt there's more than one boss in this area, the chat will scream before you get to the PONR
[1:14:39] <adithehella> why do they bleed white :I
[1:14:44] <adithehella> uncomfortable...
[1:14:45] <sirrice77> you can do this boss just not the boss after

[1:15:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> alfredo
[1:15:14] <cavefishes> just FULL of it
[1:15:15] <+CatRidder> alberta?
[1:15:22] <Druss_M> white yogurt
[1:15:24] <%ospreyworks> Albus is latin for white
[1:15:26] <cavefishes> yeah like the pasta
[1:15:27] <Srewtheshadow> There's a point of no return here?
[1:15:28] <%Mister_McDerp> alfredo men
[1:15:33] <%Valdorick> Beating them off, if you would.
[1:15:33] <+Ravenian96> You find out why they bleed cum later
[1:15:38] <%mythcreant> alas
[1:15:41] <Parapattern> They're Italians
[1:15:44] <+tragicjohnson84> Cbt enemies
[1:15:45] <coziestbank> Albeto is also an astronomy term for how reflective of light a planet's surface is.
[1:15:46] <lyzejag> Steal the cum Pat
[1:15:50] <kingra> Beating the cummies outta them
[1:15:50] <%dekkitout> My only context for albedo is measuring sunlight reflection
[1:15:54] <doggettxalex> I'm sure there's a lore item about the cummie monsters
[1:15:56] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt but there are albinauric NPCS who are like completely normal why are these ones so fucked?
[1:15:56] <%cade_calrayn> "What'd you do in Elden Ring today, Pat?" "Oh, not much, Paige, just beat the cum out of some poor Albinaurics."
[1:16:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> isn't albedo that guy from genshin?
[1:16:10] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the NPC ones just can't use their legs
[1:16:10] <+anoldtoilet> its also an alchemical term (fake) for part of the process of performing the Great Work
[1:16:18] <%Mister_McDerp> are they cum homunculi?
[1:16:23] <MidnightPacif1c> cum
[1:16:25] <tri3dgE027> Have you found any Gold / Silver Serpent ring equivalents for Elden Ring or are we stuck using the chicken leg consumable?
[1:16:28] <%Monkeyweed21> the fukin cumstains
[1:16:29] <%TheGuesty> @Kevlar_Caviar an Albedo in Xenosaga also
[1:16:29] <+Fenrisulfr_V> A Cumunculus.
[1:16:30] <doggettxalex> @PatStaresAt  if u walk aback outside there was a ladder going down to lava
[1:16:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> hocumuli
[1:16:32] <cavefishes> juuuust like iron keep
[1:16:38] <+livi242> is there a good npc quest line guide out yeah
[1:16:38] <+TheMeromex> looks like the cum castle
[1:16:41] <Gray_LoFi> Could be worse, could have someone howling at you
[1:16:45] <+anoldtoilet> Following the chaos or massa confusa of the nigredo stage, the alchemist undertakes a purification in albedo, which is literally referred to as ablutio – the washing away of impurities. This phase is concerned with "bringing light and clarity to the prima materia (the First Matter)"
[1:16:52] <+Ravenian96> HELL no
[1:16:59] <+tragicjohnson84> They're just playing Splatoon
[1:17:00] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> New game, be patient
[1:17:01] <+Ravenian96> I had to scrounge the earth to find NPCs
[1:17:01] <cavefishes> no but the quests aren't as hard to figure out as they used to be
[1:17:01] <TioXyco> @Kevlar_Caviar Albedo is an alchemichal process. "Whitening" as it is. it is also an antagonist in Xenosaga and the kid from Genshin
[1:17:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Gonna need to wait a MONTH due to the size of the game
[1:17:06] <+anoldtoilet> the alchemist undertakes a purification in albedo, which is literally referred to as ablutio – the washing away of impurities.
[1:17:08] <+anoldtoilet> "
[1:17:09] <WeebFever> slug
[1:17:15] <cavefishes> most of the NPCs will be pretty plain telling you what they want you to do
[1:17:15] <+TDotGoat> but why slug
[1:17:20] <%Mister_McDerp> slugma
[1:17:24] <cavefishes> if you're paying attention
[1:17:24] <%greasypete00> most of them are missing info, like many of the fia ones never mention that you need to go to the plateau before shell give you the knife
[1:17:24] <luciluxlu0> @cavefishes it's hard to find them tho
[1:17:29] <@Spydurman> whoever makes a full guide to this game will make a killing, proll be the first strat book to sell in ages haha
[1:17:32] <+10mPerSecond> yo pat what seal you using for your faith spells?
[1:17:36] <coziestbank> So albanaurics are "pure blood"
[1:17:40] <Kain5707> Pat how many hours do you have so far?
[1:17:40] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I dont like temporary buffs
[1:17:45] <+pectusumbra> oh, does that liver prevent lava damage?
[1:17:49] <%luftraumm1> we still in the peak discovery moment with this game, gonna take a while to see guides
[1:17:52] <cavefishes> deeproot yeahhhh
[1:18:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @10mPerSecond He's using the one Gurranq gives you, since it makes Miracles also scale with Strength.
[1:18:02] <sirrice77> Well some npcs are clear on where to go but some are like "im leaving bye" and you just need to find them somewhere
[1:18:23] <SpinJump> fuck these stairs

[1:18:35] <TioXyco> that cape looks like a hobo blanket

[1:26:31] <+FlappySeal_> Tarrrrrnished
[1:26:33] <@PrefectusCorgi> Nice Gaius
[1:26:34] <%Axellogic> The pvp lady just gives you the key to go in here though
[1:26:39] <Explodincatz> the Ocean south of England isnt real just roll right thru it
[1:26:39] <+raynetheskunk> whats with the cute little pot dude
[1:26:41] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:26:49] <%tetraes> i respect Fromsofts willingness to make content player will never see
[1:26:51] <NBUsagi> Who doesnt scrumbly the brimbo though, come on
[1:26:54] <doggettxalex> i'm surprised you didn't have to be crouching at the corner of town as it turned to daytime 4head
[1:26:56] <Parapattern> You didn't scrumch the Ploinky?
[1:26:59] <ape_hawk> you didnt hupdle the grumblo????
[1:27:01] <%Valdorick> You didn't flimflam the fallyflatchet?
[1:27:04] <%b1unkey> you gotta tickle the grundle
[1:27:04] <Fien111> Pat turning into Vinny there
[1:27:14] <rosabellamelantha> I actually respect how much of this game you can miss EXCEPT the NPCS
[1:27:16] <+Fenrisulfr_V> There's two separate side quests in order that each lead to the real boss here.
[1:27:17] <NBUsagi> Scwimble the babingi?
[1:27:17] <jubejube56> Why didn’t you have the green listerine ring?
[1:27:18] <+Ravenian96> A lot of this place is just a circle
[1:27:21] <lyzejag> Pat you forgot Slabos near the Pafus
[1:27:21] <+anoldtoilet> @tetraes yeah like, if you really want to, you can probably skip like... 80 percent of this game
[1:27:33] <%Monkeyweed21> By the time Woolies gets here he's going to assume this is part of the DLC
[1:27:33] <TheBlankAce> Wait Patches is the instigator to get in here both ways since he tells you to get the item for Rya and then also get trapped by the iron maiden
[1:27:36] <jubejube56> Yknow the one in the chest behind a wall in a cave on the other side of the map under rot
[1:27:42] <CatsEyeBlind> People haven't been doolying their scrumblos and it shows
[1:27:57] <penitentpendant> Any% runs will be REAL low
[1:28:02] <%luftraumm1> grundlehork the horker of grundles is waiting for you over there
[1:28:08] <+Ravenian96> To get to the capital yes
[1:28:26] <iteruq> :)
[1:28:27] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I mean, Radahn is technically optional.
[1:28:31] <Dopamien> I like this guys coat
[1:28:33] <+Ravenian96> Rennala
[1:28:36] <+Fenrisulfr_V> There's literally only, like, 7 mandatory bosses.
[1:28:36] <Captain_Joe1911> bumnumAsahiBeer bumnumNamaface
[1:28:40] <TioXyco> that's what you get for calling him weak before LUL
[1:28:46] <%tetraes> nah if u skip Godrick and kill Radahn and Renala it works
[1:28:47] <%greasypete00> theyre the easiest probably
[1:28:50] <%cade_calrayn> Radagon's Wolf
[1:28:53] <%luftraumm1> margaret
[1:28:59] <+Kyma1020> fun fact. you just need two
[1:29:00] <+FadingEmber> Margit is very mandatory
[1:29:00] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nahhhh Kappa
[1:29:01] <vVAstrAVv> you have to heal when ur not big
[1:29:06] <ape_hawk> thats probably why margit has an item that effectively stunlocks him
[1:29:07] <+anoldtoilet> you can apparently just walk around stormveil and go straight to liurnia
[1:29:08] <+Kyma1020> it can be any two
[1:29:12] <ChatNinja> Good fucking luck fighting Radahn without being maxed out
[1:29:35] <cavefishes> posture breaking is good shit we like posture breaking
[1:29:42] <%luftraumm1> the start up also hits right
[1:29:44] <+Kyma1020> just grind and upgrade your stuff.
[1:29:47] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @anoldtoilet It's very useful on magic builds to go there early.
[1:29:50] <%Valdorick> Oh no, he died to the lava
[1:29:51] <doggettxalex> miniboss so disappointed he left
[1:29:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @chatninja beat him already bro
[1:29:56] <%dekkitout> Stealth 100?
[1:30:00] <%Axellogic> Yeah you can just stand on the platform to cheese boss he cant stop you
[1:30:04] <cavefishes> i beat radahn in my mid-50s but it took like an hour of attempts haha
[1:30:05] <+FadingEmber> @ChatNinja Jerma beat that yesterday after streaming for 4 hours
[1:30:13] <+FadingEmber> the fight I mean
[1:30:14] <%tetraes> Powerstancing Bleed Katana is how u cheese radahn lol
[1:30:23] <KasiCrafter> You have the high ground
[1:30:31] <%Axellogic> HE does follow but you ran too quickly
[1:30:32] <Captain_Joe1911> tansyHee tansyOo
[1:30:33] <%luftraumm1> jerma was sweating after radahn
[1:30:34] <kinkade_77> i hate lava dragons so much
[1:30:35] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I personally beat Radahn with a Twinblade and BLoodflame buff.
[1:30:42] <+pectusumbra> seems like fire resist something would be helpful
[1:30:43] <doggettxalex> katanarama for life
[1:30:46] <%greasypete00> @ChatNinja pat beat radahn 2 streams ago with not much difficulty
[1:30:49] <%Maids4lyfe> you did that last time and this happened
[1:31:02] <cavefishes> late game sorcery is actually quite good
[1:31:04] <ape_hawk> gravity sorcs are AMAZING
[1:31:05] <penitentpendant> Usual gag of 'Magic Missile OP'
[1:31:11] <+ipaintwithcolor> i beat radahn with a gold old fashioned R1 & R2
[1:31:13] <+Fenrisulfr_V> 90% of them are "Glintstone Pebble but worse."
[1:31:14] <ChatNinja> Bleed in this game is kinda busted
[1:31:15] <+ipaintwithcolor> Magic is insane in this game
[1:31:16] <+Ravenian96> Glintstone Pebble has the best dmg to fp ratio in the game, it's nutty
[1:31:20] <cavefishes> i've been demolishing bosses now that i'm like 70 int
[1:31:23] <kinkade_77> is sorcery really as op as everyone is saying it is?
[1:31:31] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt I've gotten through all of the game that you have just on Pebble and Arc (the starting sorceries). They work really well when buffed, there's just not a ton of variety
[1:31:32] <%Axellogic> So how long til they nerf everything people like?
[1:31:37] <cavefishes> plus the tear that gives you 10 seconds of unlimted FP
[1:31:38] <+FadingEmber> ....can you get stuck in the belfry portals and have to kill yourself?
[1:31:40] <ape_hawk> sorc gets great late game
[1:31:40] <Explodincatz> "balance"
[1:31:41] <%luftraumm1> blood seems op, maybe nerfed eventually? hope not the balance seems fine
[1:31:41] <+ipaintwithcolor> @kinkade_77 yes. both kinds.
[1:31:44] <doggettxalex> @kinkade_77 they are easy
[1:31:45] <Kain5707> this game is like 90% bleed
[1:31:47] <r0flwaffles> pure physical is kinda whatever
[1:31:49] <%cade_calrayn> Pebble and Arc are the best though because they can be cast repeatedly while moving
[1:31:53] <%tetraes> People sleeping on frost build
[1:31:57] <penitentpendant> Minus the occassional status immune boss. *Stares at Gargoyles*
[1:31:59] <+Ravenian96> Blood doesn't work on ALL enemies
[1:31:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Pure dex and pure strength are kinda starved in the mid game
[1:32:00] <+supersonic21> once i finish my dex run im probably going to do a cosmic mage build
[1:32:03] <vVAstrAVv> yeah sorceries are either summon rock blade or galaxy. and their range isnt anything special either
[1:32:03] <cavefishes> frost goated
[1:32:08] <Captain_Joe1911> KomodoHype tansyBbb Go Pat!
[1:32:10] <ChatNinja> Poison/Skarlet Rot melts
[1:32:13] <+Stormzcales_Lair> going door blade blood myself
[1:32:13] <+ipaintwithcolor> @Monkeyweed21 it gets worse
[1:32:14] <cavefishes> there's a frost magic greatsword spell that slaps
[1:32:15] <+Fenrisulfr_V> My spellblade literally dual wields the two int katanas and does more damage with them than he does actually casting with 65 Int.
[1:32:16] <Zourath> A lot of sorceries are shit, but there's A LOT of sorceries. Even ignoring the shit ones, you have a ton of options.
[1:32:19] <Captain_Joe1911> tansyYeye Pat fighting!
[1:32:26] <%luftraumm1> gravity mage must be cool af
[1:32:32] <%MaybeFalco> oh shit sweet is that the summon from the ringleader gaol?
[1:32:34] <@QueequegTheater> @Monkeyweed21 I hope you like dual wielding greatswords
[1:33:04] <Zourath> Gravity has a lot of interesting PvP options as well, with the ability to pull people off of cliffs.
[1:33:06] <penitentpendant> It seems they switched favoring pure DEX/STR for more 'Dual Stat Builds'
[1:33:18] <+Ravenian96> yummy heart
[1:33:19] <cavefishes> the full moon is an awesome opener, and with the unlimited FP physick flask i can cast meteorite of Astel for like 15 seconds straight
[1:33:22] <cavefishes> shit's wild
[1:33:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @ipaintwithcolor oh i'm aware. fuckin best dex weapon in the game is locked behind the hardest boss lol
[1:33:40] <doggettxalex> as soon as i saw moonveil i knew i had to be vergil
[1:33:44] <+raynetheskunk> this lava barely hurts
[1:33:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> *pulls up other stream*
[1:33:49] <%luftraumm1> more dragon hearts how many is it so far?
[1:33:51] <Ner234> "Tits, ass, balls"
[1:33:52] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni's Dark Moon is REALLY fucking strong as an opener so I think it's more you need the right spells
[1:33:58] <%JoshManVGH> Is that a wolfman with a rot sword casually jaunting through laba?
[1:33:59] <ape_hawk> pat, you gonna do a sorc run after this?
[1:34:02] <%JoshManVGH> lava fuck
[1:34:02] <%dekkitout> @BeatBoxersDevMike "BALLS IN MY ASS!"
[1:34:04] <vVAstrAVv> im basically dropping my int char for faith cus im tired of blu rocks and the basic fireball is already better damage than half the glinstone rubbish at like 13 fth lol
[1:34:06] <%tetraes> @Monkeyweed21  well hardest is subjective i think the Dragonlord was harder
[1:34:11] <ChatNinja> It's weird how nothing the lava does to you compared to previous games
[1:34:16] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @luftraumm1 I think I've gotten every Dragon spell, and I still have 5 or 6 leftover hearts.
[1:34:16] <%Axellogic> Later pat
[1:34:17] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I'm still calling em souls, etstus and bonfires
[1:34:20] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i think she died to a tree guardian
[1:34:20] <%Axellogic> YOu get there later
[1:34:27] <rosabellamelantha> Also Adula's blade is like the best dps you'll get outside of the sword of night and faith
[1:34:32] <+Ravenian96> YES
[1:34:32] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> fatty

[1:35:07] <Captain_Joe1911> tansyBbb
[1:35:07] <cavefishes> @rosabellamelantha adula's moonblade is actually busted, the range and damage are insane
[1:35:07] <Parapattern> FUCK
[1:35:07] <%Nobrev> jesus fucking christ
[1:35:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> DAMN
[1:35:11] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> M E L T
[1:35:13] <%Valdorick> Oh right, Rot would increase the amount of damage her bleed does.
[1:35:13] <penitentpendant> He's Melting, MELTING! Oh what a world!
[1:35:13] <TheBlankAce> That drain is delicious
[1:35:15] <%notsoy> you fought one without a special HP bar lol
[1:35:17] <%Brassnarwhal> he's even fleshier than before
[1:35:20] <%dekkitout> I will say, summons are great for scoping out an enemy moveset
[1:35:20] <zecht89> ok that's just op
[1:35:21] <%boggsz12> i love the godskin bosses designs and all the weird stretchy shit they do
[1:35:21] <%KineticZen> Godblubber noble

[1:35:26] <@QueequegTheater> Tiche is okay but mimic is still better on pure melee builds
[1:35:26] <sirrice77> yeah tishes DoT is insane
[1:35:26] <+anoldtoilet> oh this guy looks like a noble too
[1:35:28] <%Monkeyweed21> HOLY SHIT TICHE

[1:35:45] <$EsotericOdyssey> these fuckers killed Godwyn the Golden
[1:35:48] <Zourath> If there's one thing I wish, it's that I wish Int/Arc had better options. Faith/Arc: A ton of dragon abilities with status effects that thematically scale with Arc. Int/Arc: Slow, status-less bubbles, lmao
[1:35:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you get his clothes?
[1:35:53] <%Valdorick> The Foreskin sti- okay, I'll stop
[1:35:53] <Ids560> bye rapier smough

[1:36:01] <+ipaintwithcolor> this boss was a fucking nightmare pure STR
[1:36:02] <%Nobrev> I need to get me that summon. time to do ranni's questline to even get to that zone
[1:36:02] <sirrice77> No its a incantation
[1:36:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @thesw1tch what a bad way to look at like 60% of the game's offensive options
[1:36:03] <vVAstrAVv> good read through that pillar pat lol
[1:36:06] <WeebFever> noble presence is an incantation and it's flaming wrath of the gods
[1:36:06] <%luftraumm1> meanwhile paige is getting her ass beat by erdtree avatar
[1:36:08] <jacksawjack> You can get that armor later
[1:36:19] <%Axellogic> it wasnt a spell?
[1:36:20] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt hit L3 for sorting
[1:36:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's an Incantation, I thought?

[1:38:51] <%JoshManVGH> "Glad you exist now into the box!"
[1:38:52] <+anoldtoilet> if you start as samurai you can get two uchigatanas really early
[1:38:52] <tri3dgE027> Considering it seems to use a basic Ashes of War
[1:38:54] <kinkade_77> try the spell
[1:38:55] <cavefishes> Try holding with both hands, and then thrusting required ahead
[1:38:56] <+anoldtoilet> and thats a great moveset

[1:39:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Last night I invaded someone who was in the middle of Rennala's 2nd phase, shit was wild
[1:39:32] <@Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! Hey pat, haven't been watching your streams due to spoilers, having a great time going through the game at my own pace, just finished Raya Lucaria. I hope this is okay to ask, stop reading if it isn't but just out of curiosity, did you find the two illusionary walls, the rooftop path and the secret teleporter under the water wheel? I have never played a fromsoft game that hid secrets so well and gave less of a fuck if you never found them.
[1:39:33] <%JoshManVGH> @chatninja Nope! Just both weapons being the same class
[1:39:40] <%Axellogic> Why does Radahn's rune suck
[1:39:40] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> WRATH OF THE GUNT
[1:39:44] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I didn't know what Rune Arcs did, so I sold them.
[1:39:47] <Gray_LoFi> Isn't that improved with the fatsuit
[1:39:47] <+Ravenian96> I mostly lose all my arcs from falling off cliffs
[1:39:50] <%TheAdMerlin> The pelvic thrust spell
[1:39:51] <jubejube56> Oh a lever
[1:39:55] <vVAstrAVv> ORB
[1:40:13] <cavefishes> @Fenrisulfr_V rune arcs are like humanity, embers, or human effigies from past souls games
[1:40:16] <+Ravenian96> You can keep going if you want
[1:40:17] <%Axellogic> You unlocked an elevator in that room
[1:40:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> THAT'S the way forward
[1:40:42] <cavefishes> that elevator was the way yeah
[1:40:43] <ARandomBlkGuy> jump off the balcony
[1:40:49] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cavefishes Yeah, I saw Pat use one in a stream a few days ago.
[1:41:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I had just never bothered with them and sold them to Hewg if I needed a little bit to level.
[1:41:16] <%luftraumm1> how can these areas keep going
[1:41:22] <+anoldtoilet> theyre strong
[1:41:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you know you can invade INTO Rennala's fight
[1:41:31] <+anoldtoilet> godrick rune is like hey do you need like 50 free levels for a bit
[1:41:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> tricked :)
[1:41:41] <%dekkitout> Pretty tame by soulsbourne standards
[1:41:50] <%greasypete00> mean
[1:41:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i've seen clips of people invading into RADAHN'S fight
[1:41:56] <r0flwaffles> bc fuck em
[1:41:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt It's the DS3 mimic chest spot above Pontiff Sulyahn.
[1:41:58] <%luftraumm1> that must be awesome
[1:42:09] <%greasypete00> you can do it in some other souls fights
[1:42:12] <%TaurusOxford> @luftraumm1 not for the host it isn't.
[1:42:12] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK IF I KNOW BUT I WAS THERE AT THE MOONLIT LAKE
[1:42:16] <niffinbox> level designers must have got a fat paycheck for this game
[1:42:17] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I've been grinding her on co-op and invaders are always repelled when we start the fight
[1:42:23] <+anoldtoilet> i love how elden ring makes fun of the waist high walls
[1:42:27] <Overloard> @Kevlar_Caviar i want to side with the big man himself
[1:42:31] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> 10k souls a pop
[1:42:32] <+anoldtoilet> SO MUCH oif cool progress is just oh i can jump over this now
[1:42:41] <%dekkitout> Maybe we'll find an Alatreon
[1:42:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is just a fire swamp
[1:42:45] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> weak wizard boss, good money
[1:42:46] <gnarbgnarb> Lava is just a more instant poison swamp Miyazaki
[1:42:50] <doggettxalex> why does this man never run
[1:42:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Pat, check the name of the bonfire you just got.
[1:43:04] <+Fenrisulfr_V> New god lore name.
[1:43:05] <%Nobrev> going back to souls games without free jumping is gonna mess me up
[1:43:06] <NewWillinium> There is a warning before the Final Boss so that we don't sctew up the Volcano Manor questline right?
[1:43:07] <+anoldtoilet> KMFAO
[1:43:08] <niffinbox> then jump into volcano
[1:43:10] <+anoldtoilet> what a great spell
[1:43:13] <penitentpendant> Miyazaki sees everything as a swamp derivative
[1:43:14] <%dekkitout> Lava, aka liquid rock
[1:43:14] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[1:43:15] <cavefishes> fire swamp, poison swamp, rot swamp, what's next, a piss and shit swamp?
[1:43:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt what level are you at rn? you might be strong enough to fight that satan dude now
[1:43:16] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lmao
[1:43:17] <Calamity2007> Poison swamp but spicy
[1:43:18] <%Axellogic> Its just a hotter swamp
[1:43:19] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> get off!
[1:43:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> GUSTO
[1:43:20] <+anoldtoilet> what a great spell
[1:43:23] <+Grayhammatter> what an awesome spell
[1:43:24] <%Valdorick> Is that Blackflame Wrath of God?
[1:43:33] <%Monkeyweed21> its great force
[1:43:33] <+pectusumbra> I think the notes said charging it lauches up
[1:43:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh yeah you can DEFINITELY fight satan now
[1:43:41] <doggettxalex> a lake is just a  very weak poison swamp, it only works if you put your head underwater for a while
[1:43:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i'd suggest doing that
[1:43:45] <%epide> i love how it makes you manly thrust AND THEY GO FLYING
[1:43:51] <cavefishes> oh yeah you're even a bit overlevelled for here
[1:44:02] <Calamity2007> Pat is rocking the Fierce Deity Link sword
[1:44:11] <heartlesshealer> ye
[1:44:20] <+anoldtoilet> even if it isnt the biggest game ever it FEELS like it
[1:44:24] <cavefishes> i didn't think it would be THIS big either, and people were doubting you about the size of the CNT and how big the game was
[1:44:25] <%dekkitout> It's BEEG souls
[1:44:37] <%Cozy90> It's wild to see someone go through places WAY later than i did. The game is so huge you can end up WILDLY different spots.
[1:44:37] <%twohitgood> you've had a ton of "wow this is huge" responses.
[1:44:37] <EynoStiles> I want more games like these though.
[1:44:42] <cavefishes> there's so much souls to play it's fucking amazing
[1:44:43] <%Monkeyweed21> 8 days
[1:44:45] <doggettxalex> I don't know what it's going to be remembered for, being dark souls or being just massive
[1:44:55] <+CatRidder> you average like 9 hours per stream
[1:44:57] <@QueequegTheater> IT'S TOO BIG
[1:44:57] <Calamity2007> The message that this is essentially Dark Souls 4 ,5, and 6 is not that hyperbole
[1:45:03] <+HaloIsA> Elden Ring is what happens when you give your devs a shit ton of time to complete a game
[1:45:05] <Calamity2007> This enemy reminds me of a YuGiOh monster
[1:45:08] <%Nobrev> I hate them too
[1:45:08] <heartlesshealer> it has so much health
[1:45:12] <%dekkitout> It has a good understanding of providing a good "Pick a direction and go" experience
[1:45:13] <+kewlmyc> Real talk, where the fuck do they go from here?
[1:45:20] <+Fetrigon> ay from the loading screen PogBones
[1:45:21] <%luftraumm1> ugh hate those iron maidens
[1:45:22] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Abductor Virgins are easy if you bait out their grab and then hit the hands
[1:45:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> Pat doing da Lord’s Werk
[1:45:24] <heartlesshealer> it is extremely a YuGiOh monster
[1:45:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @calamity2007 this is dead accurate
[1:45:34] <+livi242> it's so big and there's no zones that feel like Lost Izalith
[1:45:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O teleporter under the water wheel?
[1:45:36] <%Valdorick> What if they make Armored Core 6, but its Elden Ring with Mecha?
[1:45:38] <cavefishes> and the reward for exploring is "here's some souls combat and a new boss and some gear" which is amazing compared to what regular open world games give you for exploring
[1:45:39] <@PeachSaliva> 161 raiders from PeachSaliva have joined! 
[1:45:40] <+anoldtoilet> @HaloIsA also they get to flex their entire companys history of ideas and use all their old assets they spent decades making
[1:45:40] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> im shocked that ppl had day one spoiler threads. like no one's getting through this game in the first 2 days
[1:45:46] <spinningchurro> @kewlmyc greatest armored core coming up. Apart from that I don’t know.
[1:45:48] <%luftraumm1> peeeeeach raid

[1:46:11] <cavefishes> nyannPasu raiders
[1:46:11] <%Maids4lyfe> Hi Paige raiders
[1:46:13] <@Lion_kun> the game hides secrets so aggressively
[1:46:14] <+ajeanstarks78 > @patstaresat what is your answer to complaints about graphics in elden ring?
[1:46:15] <dan_g_v> numbers!!
[1:46:21] <EynoStiles> Did she get WacDonalds
[1:46:21] <@Lion_kun> Not gonna stay because spoilers but have fun pat
[1:46:24] <%MelBrooksKA> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[1:46:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's too fast
[1:46:29] <%RigmaroleHM> Ask your father
[1:46:30] <+anoldtoilet> @spinningchurro all the best armored core games are ALREADY miyazaki games so im unbelievably hype for the next one
[1:46:31] <%fat_burtreynolds> Aww da bebe hongry psaPorgmo
[1:46:33] <heartlesshealer> we got slugs here on Pat's stream
[1:46:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @cavefishes here's a the same orb you got the last 500 times and some weapons that will be gone in the next 30 minutes
[1:46:43] <+Ravenian96> Yeah I just need less stutter
[1:46:44] <ergulor> are they blind?
[1:46:46] <oda_flobunaga> BTW, Beastclaw is just as good as it was in the Network test
[1:46:52] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "this looks like an snes game"
[1:47:01] <@Lion_kun> DES looked prettier but had inferior art aesthetic
[1:47:02] <+RedMaskBandit> I can't wait to go through the lava level
[1:47:02] <%Brassnarwhal> only performance i agree with pat
[1:47:04] <Ethel9727> I just finished the game, and oh god it is SO big
[1:47:06] <cavefishes> game's pretty but i wish PC didn't have the dx12 shader cache frame drop issue
[1:47:06] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> looks better than original DES
[1:47:13] <cavefishes> hopefully fix is coming
[1:47:13] <+anoldtoilet> this has better art direction than demons souls remake so this just looks better to me imo
[1:47:14] <Sunstalker> Also the whole point of demon's was to make it look pretty
[1:47:14] <+NotaryRotary> LUL
[1:47:16] <%luftraumm1> the fact this runs is ps5 is nuts
[1:47:17] <+FlappySeal_> People thinking an openworld game on multiple platforms can be top level graphics are on major copium
[1:47:17] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:47:17] <Calamity2007> Is it worth picking this game up on PS4 or wait till I might get a PS5
[1:47:17] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> sniped
[1:47:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also Demon's Souls already got made, they mostly just slapped a new coat of paint on it
[1:47:19] <Ethel9727> It feels like it's bigger than ALL the previous souls games combined
[1:47:20] <+anoldtoilet> i dont care about how shiny it is
[1:47:22] <@Lion_kun> things hit so fucking hard in the game
[1:47:22] <+anoldtoilet> it looks cooler
[1:47:22] <Ner234> LUL
[1:47:23] <%Rbeatononefour> GOD if that oneshotted you
[1:47:24] <+RedMaskBandit> I've only had 1 crash on the PS4
[1:47:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[1:47:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:47:25] <zhenthrim213> what a throw
[1:47:25] <heartlesshealer> window
[1:47:26] <cavefishes> HE'S RIGHT
[1:47:26] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I think this game has stronger art direction because DeS changed a lot due to bluepoints whims while this is pure from
[1:47:33] <%Brassnarwhal> saw that coming
[1:47:39] <%fat_burtreynolds> Right In de ass
[1:47:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> like literally the whole point of the DeS remake is that it looks stupid good
[1:47:44] <%Brassnarwhal> saw this coming too
[1:47:45] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> SNAKE EATER
[1:47:47] <Calamity2007> @RedMaskBandit How does it run?
[1:47:50] <cavefishes> that jump was also livable but yes ladder LUL
[1:47:51] <%notsoy> not quite a thrill
[1:47:52] <%Bloomingzonda> Also DES was made by a sony studio used to the new PS5 API where Fromsoft decided to learn all the new APIs at once
[1:47:55] <+FlappySeal_> what a thrill
[1:47:56] <%Brassnarwhal> try jumping
[1:47:57] <heartlesshealer> still in a dream
[1:47:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I honestly prefer the way this game looks compared to the DeS remake. The artstyle change in the remake turned me off of it.
[1:47:58] <+SPplayer> I have 81 hours on pc, and have had 2 crashes total. I've had a great experience overall, maybe I've just been lucky
[1:47:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @rosabellamelantha still mad over what they did to vanguard demon and maneater
[1:48:06] <taylorpony> Found a kick ass farming spot in the lord of blood area
[1:48:11] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat I cant believe are complaining that BOTW should not be compared to this game
[1:48:18] <+Ravenian96> Vaati needs to explain SO MUCH SHIT
[1:48:18] <%shootbang_exe> vaati is gonna have content for years
[1:48:20] <%shootbang_exe> good for him
[1:48:27] <%Kevlar_Caviar> vaati's gonna be making lore on this game for a WHILE
[1:48:27] <%RigmaroleHM> He must be drowning in lore
[1:48:31] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Dark of the Souls
[1:48:32] <%Monkeyweed21> cant wait to see what STUPID shit ymfah does
[1:48:35] <%Maids4lyfe> vaati is still alive?
[1:48:38] <Ner234> Vaati eating good for the next ten years
[1:48:38] <kinkade_77> why do they bleed cum
[1:48:40] <%Brassnarwhal> good for his viewers too
[1:48:46] <NewWillinium> Other then Skyrim. Because people keep mentioning Skyrim while playing this game in Streams
[1:48:47] <@Spydurman> just some clickbait titles
[1:48:48] <dan_g_v> it will take a bit more than that
[1:48:48] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> he knew the DARK RECIPES
[1:48:49] <%RigmaroleHM> @Monkeyweed21 He already posted something today
[1:48:49] <%fat_burtreynolds> Oooooooh the Vaati
[1:48:49] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt Did you find the nomad merchant and the golden seed inside of the royal academy entrance?
[1:48:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> but why is it always fingers...
[1:48:52] <%abakkus> vaati's gonna get years of videos out of this game, easy
[1:48:54] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I think this is where you go if you get abducted
[1:48:54] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha they ruined a lot of enemies in the remake, it took MASSIVE backlash for them to change flamelurker back from the diablo clone he was originally which says a LOT
[1:48:55] <Sol_Install> hmm, to compare this to btow doesn't seem right
[1:48:55] <Calamity2007> BotW and Skyrim are the two big comparisons
[1:48:55] <%Brassnarwhal> it's extremely comparable
[1:48:57] <%barrakuta371> I think PCGamer made an article like that lol
[1:48:59] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:49:05] <+Based_Moose> Why Gief sad
[1:49:07] <%fat_burtreynolds> Box rat evolved
[1:49:07] <niffinbox> vaati is gonna have content for the next 10 years
[1:49:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @kinkade_77 they're artificial cum people
[1:49:10] <dan_g_v> dark breath of the wild
[1:49:11] <Parapattern> Please let poor Vaati branch out his content
[1:49:18] <rosabellamelantha> I still honestly prefer playing original DeS because I think the art style is WAY BETTER
[1:49:19] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat I agree with you. but people who like BOTW are just getting thier feelings hurt for no reason
[1:49:20] <@Spydurman> Mostly I'm glad that FromSoft will probably have funding forever to mak more games
[1:49:24] <Sunstalker> Did he do the yuria invasion too?
[1:49:28] <%Brassnarwhal> BREATH OF THE WILD HAD PARRY AND COUNTER MECHANICS it really was zelden ring
[1:49:29] <%Monkeyweed21> WAIT THERES A MERCHANT IN THE ACADEMY
[1:49:30] <%Puhff> Yeah it's literally Evil BotW
[1:49:35] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  so how does Hoizon FW stack up gainst Elden Ring?
[1:49:36] <%Cozy90> Pat i got to look like a cool guy in front of my group of friends when i beat the tutorial boss while everyone else died.
[1:49:40] <cavefishes> it's a helmet
[1:49:40] <+SPplayer> helmet
[1:49:40] <WeebFever> das a HAT
[1:49:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> helmet
[1:49:43] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> ITS A HAT
[1:49:44] <%TheAdMerlin> It's a hat
[1:49:44] <%shootbang_exe> helmet
[1:49:44] <ergulor> hat
[1:49:44] <%luftraumm1> headpiece
[1:49:45] <%BlueLunecy> Scarab hat

[1:49:55] <%Saadi90> Hat
[1:49:55] <%Nobrev> bug hat
[1:49:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @puhff actually the other game is just the zelden ring
[1:50:05] <scrumbotime> well, put it on, heal, then take it off
[1:50:06] <dan_g_v> helmet
[1:50:07] <%RigmaroleHM> Do you think they did a good job translating their formula to open world?
[1:50:08] <%OrangeMDT> You miss one elden ring stream and suddenly we’re in a volcano
[1:50:10] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "every eld has it's ring" -vaati
[1:50:23] <+SPplayer> It's crazy how non threatening lava is in this game
[1:50:33] <%shootbang_exe> big fuckin game
[1:50:34] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> HorseCrafting
[1:50:34] <+RedMaskBandit> I see what you mean. ER is slightly more grittier because of the Beresek lineage.
[1:50:36] <VHLW> ultra adventure games
[1:50:36] <%dekkitout> Exploratory action adventure
[1:50:37] <%Cozy90> open world slashem ups
[1:50:37] <%BlueLunecy> True Open World?
[1:50:39] <doggettxalex> ya they both have volcano zones, and rainey zones
[1:50:41] <Gray_LoFi> Lava isn't lethal because the world isn't shit yet
[1:50:42] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat the ruler hat raises your faith if you ever need or want that, in case you didn't already know
[1:50:42] <cavefishes> open world fuck-a-thon is good
[1:50:42] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> sometimes its just fun to jump off a clip and survive and look at how that would have killed me in like dark souls 2
[1:50:43] <kinkade_77> explore big fun world
[1:50:44] <zero2700> sandbox openworld
[1:50:44] <Druss_M> LUL
[1:50:44] <%Nobrev> exploration/action rpg maybe
[1:50:45] <Calamity2007> Man I love the texture of the cooled lava
[1:50:46] <AgnusLaplace> the zelda devs call it open air, but that's retarded
[1:50:47] <%Maids4lyfe> open world rpg
[1:50:48] <%luftraumm1> it's a skyrim
[1:50:48] <NewWillinium> I hear people compare it to BOTW and Skyrim
[1:50:49] <+RedMaskBandit> sand box rpg?
[1:50:50] <+wmeldrum> also kinda mgsv
[1:50:51] <Parapattern> But wouldn't this game be sooo much better with super breakable weapons? Kappa
[1:50:52] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that lava did shit for damage
[1:50:57] <jkfd> organic open world
[1:50:58] <%Brassnarwhal> ZELDEN RING
[1:50:59] <KasiCrafter> It'd say BOTW's an unfair comparison just from how BEEFY this game is
[1:51:01] <17sevens> cffowft for short
[1:51:01] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> THEY TOTALLY WOULD
[1:51:02] <mrtanaka111> i like how half of this game is swamps
[1:51:02] <WeebFever> it's not a sandbox since you don't have a huge amount of control over the world itself. It's more like a.. toybox.
[1:51:06] <%TheAdMerlin> Open World Adventure Game
[1:51:07] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Dark of the Souls
[1:51:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> The genre is "Now Go!"
[1:51:10] <%fat_burtreynolds> Breath of The Tsushima hidden in the Valley of the West
[1:51:11] <kinkade_77> this is closer to botw than skyrim
[1:51:12] <%shootbang_exe> DEATH OF THE WILD IS GOOD
[1:51:13] <%TheAdMerlin> OWAG
[1:51:13] <%dekkitout> A Strand Gama Kappa
[1:51:14] <+anoldtoilet> i definitely REALLY liked mgs5 and played it for like hundreds of hours
[1:51:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i do wish the npcs didnt withhold directions from you tho
[1:51:17] <%Monkeyweed21> fuck a thon seems appropriate given how many waifus are in each game
[1:51:18] <UnImprest> botw is the same price as this right now
[1:51:18] <cavefishes> it's that but it's also VERY dark souls in every way
[1:51:19] <Guardiansaiyan> DEATH OF THE WILD fits actually

[1:51:48] <+RedMaskBandit> sounds like a weird Leshen inspired rock band.
[1:51:48] <%Valdorick> It has coves, it has steep cliff sides... but it has no caves.
[1:51:52] <Happydisaster> Death of the wild sounds like a badass game

[2:04:15] <%sporeian94> I beat the whole game and never got to this area cause I never joined the volcano manner cause I thought it would fuck up my ending
[2:04:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[2:04:18] <Ethel9727> "I beat the whole game and never found out what it's for." could sum up the whole game.  tbh

[2:14:06] <Sunstalker> Yeah but the other direction also has stuff
[2:14:07] <%Valdorick> There's 2 bridges as you enter. The north one leads to the seed

[2:15:12] <KasiCrafter> More upsetting than the merchant in that rot place?
[2:15:13] <pi_in_the_sci> @Brassnarwhal The whole purpose of them is walking into a place with the expectation of death, is there a better use of them?
[2:15:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> also there's that invade prompt

[2:46:16] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> Big dragon really is the solution to most problems
[2:46:29] <%Valdorick> There's a real boss in this aera, and an optional boss in this area.
[2:46:32] <%vance168> Aliens
[2:46:33] <%dekkitout> Or the most successful freak

[2:46:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @MidnightPacif1c There's two gargoyles at Nokron down a side path. After you beat them, there's a coffin at the edge of a waterfall in their boss room.
[2:46:53] <NBUsagi> I mean isnt the Golden Order just standard medival shit like "suck it peasant?"
[2:46:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> This is where it leads.
[2:46:58] <Omenaire_> aliens...
[2:46:58] <%fat_burtreynolds> Gilgamesh huh

[2:47:21] <%dekkitout> Why's that homunculus a nugget
[2:47:24] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the greater will is basically just an ayylmao that sent down a beast to conquer a planet and the dumbass inhabitants helped it with only the giants saying no from what we've seen so far
[2:47:25] <%luftraumm1> @AllenDeadman SOLOED geez
[2:47:37] <ExpressNode> Where's the norse?
[2:47:37] <heartlesshealer> now you can check that map
[2:47:45] <RickyRelucent> i'd be content if elden ring becomes medievil fantasy monhun
[2:47:46] <%fat_burtreynolds> Made a spirit tree to connect spirit and world. I got that pane from berserk as my magic the gathering play mat
[2:47:47] <jacksawjack> Lavos
[2:47:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> The world tree, the dragons, the seveal realms...
[2:47:57] <Glockroach2774> Since shit is from space. is this technically a sci-fi game
[2:47:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> *several
[2:48:04] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Sounds like someone's blaming the beast just because they were unable to change
[2:48:06] <%luftraumm1> there's some badass lore in this meteor
[2:48:14] <Omenaire_> this is the greatest game ever made
[2:48:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> So when did the giants get de-tummy
[2:48:23] <coziestbank> The Erdtree isn't just some network tree like Nier is it?
[2:48:23] <ExpressNode> Oh like Yggdrasil shit
[2:48:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @TheGreatSkenardo LUL
[2:48:24] <%Valdorick> This explains why Ranni's plan is "push the stars far far away from the earth"
[2:48:24] <oda_flobunaga> Skeeter Flats
[2:48:25] <TwistParabola> i found an invocation that kinda suggests that initially EVERYONE was opposed to the Golden Order
[2:48:33] <%jamsbybetty> oh shit it's Lhutel
[2:48:35] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Pookiedaexzile It'll make sense later, when we get to the Giant Zone.

[2:48:53] <Shockmaster182> Playing BB for first time and just beat shadows of yharnam
[2:48:58] <Omenaire_> BASILISK PogChamp
[2:48:59] <+Based_Moose> Yo this place sucks
[2:49:09] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Pat I had an epiphany last night. The Furled Finger motif is a direct reference to the Claw Grip style
[2:49:11] <Shockmaster182> Ejaculate City
[2:49:11] <%dekkitout> These games never had good guys
[2:49:12] <ebrion> Merica?
[2:49:15] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt Its like those sci fi stories where the aliens come to conquer the people by making the dependent on their weird space tech
[2:49:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Ranni is pretty chill
[2:49:16] <heartlesshealer> HEY YEO
[2:49:16] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Ranni's plan seems pretty universally good
[2:49:18] <tanarath> At this point, Ranni?
[2:49:18] <+stellarseeker> GRRM wrote this, there are no good guys
[2:49:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Arguably the only good guy might be Ranni but that's a BIG if
[2:49:19] <@QueequegTheater> Radahn maybe
[2:49:20] <%Rbeatononefour> ranni's nice
[2:49:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> What is that walking house thing
[2:49:24] <%TheGuesty> Blaiid is Guts and that is ok with me
[2:49:25] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> hate when that happens
[2:49:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Not the Dung Eater
[2:49:27] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt All the headless down here can drop their set.

[2:49:38] <%fat_burtreynolds> tarnished undead hooter
[2:49:41] <imthewisejanitor> Hell House????
[2:49:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She wants to buck the world order but she's not afraid of the costs
[2:49:41] <Happydisaster> The demigods
[2:49:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck this shit, i'm going to the moon
[2:49:42] <%Valdorick> Ranni's plan is "The outter gods are problems, throw them out"
[2:49:48] <tanarath> Which would end the scarlet rot, though
[2:49:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Santa and his family seem chill
[2:49:48] <PenguinPall> Ranni lead to all this
[2:49:51] <NBUsagi> Ranni just seems like she wants to fuck off to find the eldritch truth which isnt explicitly malicios
[2:49:52] <%fat_burtreynolds> You must bbq the pizza, shirtless in the rain
[2:50:00] <+SilverDevilfish> "I don't want to live on this planet anymore" - Ranni
[2:50:07] <heartlesshealer> yeah there was a huge walking building in the background while pat was getting to the grace
[2:50:08] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Ranni's plan is telling gods to fuck off which is fair
[2:50:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Order of the Guzzlers
[2:50:28] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Looks like the society that predated the anor londo rooftops
[2:50:31] <heartlesshealer> there
[2:50:33] <oda_flobunaga> Nameless Eternal City
[2:50:36] <%crimsonharvest> the surface society seems very artificially stratified so there had to be something before right
[2:50:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Elden Ring = Ragnarok?
[2:50:38] <NBUsagi> I mean it is a religion built around worshipping 2 fingers that literally cant talk
[2:50:41] <eleskei> big boy
[2:50:45] <+wmeldrum> the promethean/forerunners/acient ones
[2:50:45] <%Buzzard42> BONG

[2:50:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt drop down onto it
[2:50:52] <Wakerz140> Get on to the grassy part
[2:50:57] <ExpressNode> Give it a pedicure
[2:50:57] <%TheGreatSkenardo> leave them alone they're endangered
[2:50:59] <%greasypete00> get on top and there are skull sround

[2:51:02] <PenguinPall> I "Think" You jus hit it until it gives up
[2:51:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Ask him to come down
[2:51:04] <+678saintglock> you gotta use the branches to get on top
[2:51:10] <narusao> Elmo  <3
[2:51:11] <%Saadi90> Find a way to get to the top
[2:51:11] <ape_hawk> wait, why is pat riding in cum?

[2:51:24] <TioXyco> so no head
[2:51:24] <oda_flobunaga> nothing, ain't got no heads
[2:51:28] <%Valdorick> I like the implication that not having a head lets you just ignore space/time
[2:51:39] <Boombay1213> They are looking at nothing
[2:51:43] <%sporeian94> The Theme of The Game is Dual Identitiy!
[2:51:44] <toulon_somberjade> Try killing the headless soldiers

[2:51:49] <eleskei> why is the music so ominous
[2:51:52] <%Valdorick> Hey do you want something cool!? KILL HER
[2:51:53] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Their armor set explains it. They willingly decapitated themselves to become eternal guardians of whatever this is down here.

[2:52:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> Cool Ice
[2:53:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> Dio could have done it for them, they didn’t have to
[2:53:23] <toulon_somberjade> I think the heads on the feet only show up when you kill the headless guardians
[2:53:26] <TwistParabola> probably, yeah
[2:53:27] <TheSinner42> you missed the lone coffin back there pat
[2:53:31] <eleskei> the milk water is like the last part of evil within 2

[2:54:48] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Can't believe you stole her clothes.
[2:54:48] <sirrice77> the spear knights are easier than the shield ones imo
[2:54:49] <TwistParabola> @stellarseeker iirc yeah
[2:54:52] <%Valdorick> They're JUST BLACK KNIGHTS

[2:59:45] <coziestbank> It's EVA Adam - Lilith bullshit
[2:59:47] <%Valdorick> Gold Magic is the Sun, Moon Magic is... uh... the Moon
[2:59:49] <+stellarseeker> Suns are just stars, after all
[2:59:54] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the golden seal from the beta explicitely states that they are the exact same thing
[2:59:55] <blue8moon> well the moon is in the sky, and the sun is in the sky
[2:59:57] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Always punished
[2:59:58] <TwistParabola> i mean it's different but similar
[3:00:01] <imthewisejanitor> Who are the five greatest characters in Elden Ring? Think about it: Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan.
[3:00:02] <%SulfurousAcid> we love moon
[3:00:03] <XforkandsporkX> yo not gonna lie i would greeted that too tho
[3:00:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Gold Magic is the sun filtered through a tree
[3:00:09] <%epide> yeah but it draws the power a bit different but yes
[3:00:11] <darce_avidson> I find it funny that comparatively dragon worship in Elden Ring is accepted compared to Dark Souls
[3:00:12] <%JoshManVGH> Told you, Aliens.
[3:00:16] <%crimsonharvest> but isnt moon magic just sun magic reflected off the moon once
[3:00:17] <+moneymsa> I just got here, my jaw hit the floor, lol
[3:00:17] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[3:00:19] <darce_avidson> Since lightning is yellow, thus gold
[3:00:20] <%Valdorick> She totally Rots, by the way.
[3:00:20] <Omenaire_> this story is so fucking beautiful, miyazaki is a damn genius
[3:00:26] <Bagelborn> venus in japanese is gold star
[3:00:30] <coziestbank> Are the dragons native?
[3:00:31] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I really wonder if the Erdtree is one of those "alien resource miner" things that are super popular in sci-fi.
[3:00:37] <%SulfurousAcid> ancient aliens? NotLikeThis
[3:00:38] <rosabellamelantha> People weren't made by the tree
[3:00:41] <%Valdorick> @crimsonharvest Yes, but so is tree magic, in that way.
[3:00:43] <Ethel9727> Lumen was an optioon for you character race at the start
[3:00:57] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt wait till you get to the capital
[3:01:01] <TwistParabola> Help me VaatiVidya, you are my only hope

[3:01:37] <TwistParabola> still no proc
[3:01:42] <%SulfurousAcid> hit her with the olllll DICK TWIST
[3:01:54] <%Valdorick> Its how I killed her - rotted her then hid like a bitch
[3:01:54] <darce_avidson> think he might be immune
[3:01:55] <Gray_LoFi> Crucible knights are immune to every status effect aren't they
[3:01:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Ranni's main issue is that the tree is connecting EVERYTHING to it, including people's souls so she wants to
[3:01:59] <darce_avidson> nvm
[3:02:01] <rosabellamelantha> end it
[3:02:03] <Gray_LoFi> Oh guess not
[3:02:03] <darce_avidson> just high resist
[3:02:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> It can be
[3:02:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> she got that rotten crucible knussy
[3:02:12] <%Nobrev> I think lightnign spear spam is your best bet
[3:02:13] <%Valdorick> And this is why I use the 1 heart rot breath, because I coward out on a horse LUL
[3:02:13] <TwistParabola> @PatStaresAt the armor is weak to lightning so she probably is too
[3:02:15] <heartlesshealer> 26 damage per tick?
[3:02:17] <+hakumaribo> is there an ash of war that applies rot passive to a weapon?
[3:02:25] <taylorpony> Frost would serve better
[3:02:29] <pi_in_the_sci> Has Pat even tried to hit 'em with his sword?
[3:02:32] <coziestbank> lightning grease?
[3:02:34] <morkelebmink> you could always summon your Babe, and let her fight him for you
[3:02:43] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt blood slash works pretty well here
[3:02:44] <%dekkitout> I bet there's a cut one
[3:02:45] <%TheGuesty> rot grease does exist
[3:02:48] <ExpressNode> I mean theres rot grease
[3:02:50] <%Mantorok06> There is a knife that has rot I think?
[3:02:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @hakumaribo Not that I've seen, but I've personally found a unique dagger and greataxe that does.
[3:02:50] <darce_avidson> There are weapons that naturally have rot
[3:02:51] <TwistParabola> not an ash of war but there is a grease i thnk
[3:02:57] <%Valdorick> There's weapon arts that stab a bunch and greases that apply Rot
[3:02:57] <%Nobrev> @morkelebmink looks like you cant summon ashes here
[3:02:58] <coziestbank> Rot grease isn't that hard to make
[3:02:59] <NewWillinium> There is a NPC who uses a dagger that has Rot on it. Not sure if you can get that though
[3:03:05] <darce_avidson> it's only like 2 weapons, but they exist
[3:03:06] <morkelebmink> ah ok
[3:03:10] <+RedMaskBandit> blue lighting?
[3:03:12] <+ATorL> Flame of the Redmanes, it has ridiculously high stagger and might help
[3:03:14] <+Pachi3000> oof
[3:03:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> OOOOOH
[3:03:15] <rosabellamelantha> Pat has that dagger
[3:03:15] <mikesapartment> mama miba
[3:03:16] <dds333a> yikes
[3:03:17] <%sniffy77> big stabbo
[3:03:19] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck one hi
[3:03:20] <+Ravenian96> There is scarlet rot grease that works on any regular weapon
[3:03:20] <%luftraumm1> instagib
[3:03:21] <notmilician> People figure out the soft caps yet? Sitting on clean 40s for my main stats right now, not sure if I should bump it up to 50 or 60.
[3:03:22] <+hakumaribo> that shit was near instant
[3:03:24] <%dekkitout> Brutal command grab
[3:03:25] <%SulfurousAcid> she just made knife hand
[3:03:26] <oda_flobunaga> I have a rapier with Rot and Poison on it at the same time
[3:03:27] <jacksawjack> Get punked
[3:03:28] <The_Murray_Carp> Get Shanked
[3:03:31] <%Monkeyweed21> GET CRABBED
[3:03:32] <andoowhy> turned you into a hand puppet
[3:03:32] <%Canorius> ah
[3:03:34] <notmilician> WONDERFUL
[3:03:35] <XxMoliciousxX> is cast times reduced with dex or no?
[3:03:37] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> AKW4RD_BUFF4LO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Here’s to another month hanging out with Pat!
[3:03:41] <MidnightPacif1c> psaGiefstare_TK
[3:03:44] <darce_avidson> 60's i believe
[3:03:44] <+Ravenian96> I believe soft cap of int is 80 or something crazy
[3:03:50] <%notsoy> some spells require like, 60-80 int or faith
[3:03:51] <notmilician> Any chance I could see your stats Pat?
[3:03:55] <%dekkitout> Gonna throw a random number and guess 74
[3:03:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I was still getting good gains on INT till 70 so
[3:03:57] <%Valdorick> 20 is the softest of caps, 40s and 60s are the believed caps on most things
[3:03:57] <+hakumaribo> theres a spell that requires 70 int so it must be up there
[3:04:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @notmilician HP softcaps at 60. That's the only one I know of.
[3:04:02] <coziestbank> The highest reqs are 60 for Str, 49 for Dex, 60 for Int, 50 for Faith, and 20 for Arcane
[3:04:03] <blue8moon> the recommended levels for this game go high
[3:04:05] <%fat_burtreynolds> Infinite StairClimb
[3:04:07] <imthewisejanitor> Happy birthday, duder!
[3:04:14] <jacksawjack> I've seen that hp bar halfway across the screen
[3:04:20] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @coziestbank There's a 72 Int spell.
[3:04:21] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> They are around 60
[3:04:22] <%Paralurx> @imthewisejanitor many thanks sir
[3:04:25] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I am at your level with 15 vit so health is not necessary
[3:04:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Maybe there is no soft cap
[3:04:38] <dds333a> excellent
[3:04:47] <%Valdorick> Int want 70 at its highest, I think Pat *has* the highest faith spell, at 50 points on Elden Stars (and that spell sucks ass)
[3:04:47] <%SulfurousAcid> no soft cap only hard cap
[3:04:54] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Strength still hasn't softcapped at 67
[3:04:55] <penitentpendant> Close
[3:04:55] <+678saintglock> i’m at 132 and it feels like i’m suppose to keep going but this is the highest i’ve ever gone and i’m scurred
[3:04:56] <%mythcreant> ; w ;
[3:04:59] <dolphinbj> I'm still getting one tapped by some things at 35 vit
[3:05:01] <TwistParabola> F
[3:05:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> jesus
[3:05:08] <%Canorius> F
[3:05:11] <+ShadowRFox> its good they set the soft cap insanely high. The past souls games felt like I would hit the soft caps way to early in the game
[3:05:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Big ooof
[3:05:30] <%scarman125> wait do I need to actually level up my hp in this game? I can't just leave it at 20 like I've done in every single Souls game ever? is that why I keep getting one shot?
[3:05:30] <penitentpendant> Lucky Ted ARCANE viable!
[3:05:30] <%Valdorick> Correct
[3:05:33] <+Ravenian96> This is just a random chump
[3:05:36] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @dolphinbj I went up to 50, and I was still getting one-shot.
[3:05:36] <notmilician> Also, any chance people know if defeating Rennala screws with Ranni's quest line? Heard a rumor it may mess with that.
[3:05:38] <TwistParabola> correct
[3:05:43] <darce_avidson> I know there's at least a katana that wants 48 DEX
[3:05:48] <+aaymon86> I feel like 150 will be the new Meta. Cause everything in this game is insanely strong.
[3:05:48] <darce_avidson> @notmilician doesn't
[3:05:53] <darce_avidson> at least it didn't for me
[3:05:56] <%Valdorick> @notmilician does not
[3:05:56] <+Critversity> it does not
[3:06:08] <+Ravenian96> i'm staying 130 just in case
[3:06:09] <+ATorL> 150 is too low
[3:06:11] <darce_avidson> did rennala, then ranni if that makes a difference
[3:06:12] <coziestbank> Soft caps for non-damage stats from Wiki: Vigor 40, Mind 52, End 50 for stam 60 for equip load
[3:06:17] <Tenebrae94> no power within @patstaresat?
[3:06:17] <notmilician> Dope, thanks ya'll. Been holding off on that for an unreasonable amount of time.
[3:06:22] <oda_flobunaga> If you are going to get 1 shot anyway, what's the point of health
[3:06:25] <+ipaintwithcolor> I’ve over 50 vigor and damn is that barely enough some times
[3:06:31] <%Kevlar_Caviar> 52????
[3:06:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> Overconfidence can be a slow and insidious killer
[3:06:34] <%Valdorick> oh yeah, FP gains just STOP past 52
[3:06:35] <mrtanaka111> has pat killed the snake already?
[3:06:43] <darce_avidson> PvP meta? You mean Hoarfrost Stomp?
[3:06:46] <%Valdorick> You get 360 mana and that's fucking it
[3:06:49] <coziestbank> Those are the numbers when the gains decrease
[3:06:51] <Explodincatz> only insane people will lvl to over 100 just to PvP
[3:06:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @darce_avidson I
[3:06:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @mrtanaka111 He walked in then left
[3:07:00] <+Pachi3000> what a cool dude you are, pat
[3:07:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> fuck i hit enter too early lmao
[3:07:06] <%Buzzard42> woah
[3:07:07] <EvelinaLoveaux> yooo what is that cloak?
[3:07:08] <GhostPyre> big damage
[3:07:08] <%Paralurx> He said the thing from the comic books!
[3:07:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow, just like Chris Evans used to do
[3:07:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FUCK
[3:07:12] <+hakumaribo> 601 on a jump attack, holy shit!!!!
[3:07:14] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @darce_avidson I'M GONNA STOOMP
[3:07:15] <chowndawg> flask of physik
[3:07:16] <lyzejag> FUUUCKL
[3:07:17] <darce_avidson> @Kevlar_Caviar lol
[3:07:23] <%Buzzard42> damn this dude hits like a truck
[3:07:29] <dolphinbj> that spin is nasty if you roll right
[3:07:31] <darce_avidson> There are three busted ashes of war
[3:07:34] <darce_avidson> hoarfrost stomp
[3:07:36] <darce_avidson> blood slash
[3:07:39] <darce_avidson> and quickstep
[3:07:40] <ExpressNode> Thats fast
[3:07:43] <notmilician> I just love how when a boss sees you start to lift a flask they're just like OH HELL NO, NOT HAVING ANY OF THAT TODAY!
[3:07:44] <dds333a> there she goes, there she goes again
[3:07:58] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I'm convinced that there's some kind of HP% damage scaling in this game, as things that would do more than Pat's HP bar to me are only doing half his healthbar.
[3:08:00] <%Canorius> she really makes ya waste those heals
[3:08:09] <%fat_burtreynolds> He’s tough
[3:08:11] <darce_avidson> @notmilician Pat is going to fucking HATE one of the upcoming bosses because of that
[3:08:16] <%crimsonharvest> yeah this game is just like NES boss fights, you win or you die
[3:08:19] <nesbitt22> I get it pat
[3:08:22] <%twohitgood> can you parry him?
[3:08:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Her hammer looks like a bunch of bananas
[3:08:24] <%Valdorick> Could it also just be... armor stats?
[3:08:27] <jacksawjack> He's gonna break your bussy
[3:08:32] <%Pookiedaexzile> I saw you not dodge the winged tackle thats high telegraphed
[3:08:32] <+badhaye> yeah i blew through this zone
[3:08:37] <%Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! 3 years babycakes, can't believe it. Just wanted to remind you that A Dance of Dragons came out in 2011 and in the mean time. FromSoft has released the entire Dark Souls series, Bloodbourne, and Sekiro. Yup, real excited to see what Brandon Sanderson eventually does with GoT....
[3:08:37] <TwistParabola> i like how the crucible knights just KNOW to fuck you if you flask away from them
[3:08:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean, there's armor and resistances and shit
[3:08:41] <+Critversity> armor actually does something in this game
[3:08:44] <darce_avidson> Aka the two at once for those who know
[3:08:48] <dds333a> shanked
[3:08:53] <coziestbank> @Fenrisulfr_V Defense negation is a thing
[3:08:54] <doster504> @Fenrisulfr_V are you playing on pc by any chance?
[3:08:55] <+thickshield> your level influences your defense, so if you are taking a lot of damage you are likely underlevel for an area
[3:08:56] <Alrom> @Fenrisulfr_V what kind of armor are you using? armor doesnt matter too much but sometimes those 20% are a lfie saver
[3:08:56] <dds333a> It didn't that time LUL
[3:08:59] <zecht89> i don't think you're supposed to be here
[3:09:00] <Ner234> stabby
[3:09:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Valdorick I was wearing moderately heavy armor. Had at least 35% reduction to damage for just about everything.
[3:09:03] <+alphonseisbest> Hey does anyone know how long you have to let Fua rebuff you for her quest?
[3:09:07] <+hakumaribo> i dont even attempt parrys anymore, everytime i do, i get my ass blown open.
[3:09:07] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V Yeah.
[3:09:14] <TwistParabola> LUL
[3:09:26] <mrtanaka111> lol
[3:09:29] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, but he's a bad author
[3:09:29] <dolphinbj> Sanderson will never write a book with real swears in it
[3:09:30] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Alrom Enchanted Knight Chest, Haslow's Gauntlets, Gelmir Knight Leggings, Commoner Headband.
[3:09:30] <+ipaintwithcolor> Yeah there has to be scaling involved for sure. No doubt
[3:09:34] <dds333a> The Sanderson way LUL
[3:09:34] <%dmbender> Sanderson wrote 5 novels IN SECRET in the past two years while also keeping up with his release schedule
[3:09:39] <dolphinbj> his mrmon heart can't take it
[3:09:40] <penitentpendant> He is... THE COMPLETIONIST (Book Edition)
[3:09:42] <%JonathLP> Brand "The Closer" Sanderson
[3:09:45] <mrtanaka111> meanwhile brandon sanderson releases 5 books in a week
[3:09:45] <+Nobrev> sanderson is one of my favorite authors
[3:09:45] <oda_flobunaga> Or rather, he's lie 2 steps up from Salvatore
[3:09:46] <+NeonFishFace> morman game of thrones...
[3:09:52] <%justcallmebobplease> That SHOULD be a prestigious detail to his career, as that takes crazy skill and effort to emulate someone to finish their work.
[3:09:52] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Brandon Sanderson just kicckstarted the self published release of FOUR books he worked on IN SECRET
[3:09:53] <%Puhff> Oh yeah I should read those. Stormlight Archives I think? I hear good things
[3:09:56] <%TheLemuroid> Brandon Sanderson broke Kickstarter records the other day
[3:10:01] <+Maleicus> cool spear
[3:10:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> good hitboxes
[3:10:05] <%JoshManVGH> Along with working on ALL HIS OTHER BOOKS!
[3:10:05] <doster504> @Fenrisulfr_V Damage negation and some scaling is fucked up rn and I've more people talk about it on the pc version then others so that could possibly be a thing
[3:10:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What if GRRM already wrote them but wants to release them post humously?
[3:10:10] <+CatRidder> The Stormlight Archive is a great series of books
[3:10:14] <%Nobrev> @Puhff yes do it. do it now. you won't regret it
[3:10:15] <jkfd> i wouldn't worry about sanderson
[3:10:15] <%Buzzard42> no you aren't
[3:10:16] <%dekkitout> Which is worse, to be Brandon Sanderson or Neal Stephenson?
[3:10:17] <morkelebmink> so you can't block the foot stomp
[3:10:24] <coziestbank> I think the higher stat caps/reqs are fine in this one because of stuff like physic buffs and great rune
[3:10:25] <dds333a> @ballerswagbro9k 5d chess
[3:10:30] <%Valdorick> @Fenrisulfr_V What level are you? Levels give armor points, no matter how small
[3:10:36] <%Buzzard42> this dude is beating your ass

[3:10:56] <%TheLemuroid> Brandon Sanderson: "Oops accidentally wrote 4 extra books"
[3:11:02] <%Puhff> @Puhff what would you compare it to? all i've heard is "high-fantasy"
[3:11:04] <+SinisterBroccoli> have you found the chest maze mini dungeon? it's hilarious
[3:11:06] <%Buzzard42> got heem
[3:11:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> nice

[3:12:14] <dolphinbj> @Puhff high fantasy with a very unique setting and cultures and really effective multi-character writing
[3:12:16] <jkfd> sanderson's kickstarter has done north of 20 million over a couple of days and he ended up writing an "extra 4 books" during covid lockdowns or something
[3:12:28] <+hakumaribo> is this anor londo???

[3:12:37] <%JoshManVGH> The Nameless, but Eternal, City.
[3:12:40] <%TheAdMerlin> So the lands between have THREE cities called "The eternal City"?
[3:12:41] <notmilician> Man, faith is so spoiled in this game. Literally every neat weapon I see has faith scaling/requirements. Bummer for my battlemage build...
[3:12:46] <lyzejag> URGH
[3:12:48] <+Grayhammatter> all up in that trussy
[3:12:48] <%Puhff> This game is really into the Horn aesthetic for some reason
[3:13:00] <%Puhff> Margit's got horns, dung eater has em, and now this weapon
[3:13:03] <dds333a> Is this ALSO a home of the gods Kappa

[3:13:35] <Omenaire_> @notmilician i leveled faith late after starting a dex/int build, it was worth it, i get a little of everything

[3:14:15] <+hakumaribo> im just waiting for an area name drop to be just "Anor Londo: so i can lose my shit.
[3:14:19] <JPFirepledge> impaled by the trussy
[3:14:26] <+ParzAno> Pat whats the best flavor of Pop Tart
[3:14:26] <%shootbang_exe> there is a grace at the top so don't worry too much
[3:14:30] <notmilician> @Omenaire_ I just really like my frosty Night Cavalry Glaive. I don't wanna respec faith, but god, ever freakin' weapon I find that looks awesome is like 20+ faith to use.
[3:14:38] <dds333a> that time, yeah
[3:14:41] <+aaymon86> It seems like Faith is way better than Sorcereries this time around.
[3:14:43] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @hakumaribo Did you miss the Dark Moon Ring and Moonlight Greatsword from last stream?
[3:14:45] <%fat_burtreynolds> I could go for a food
[3:15:06] <+thickshield> azure comet is stupid strong.
[3:15:13] <Omenaire_> sorceries go crazy
[3:15:13] <sirrice77> you can cast meteor
[3:15:14] <%Valdorick> Pat... you haven't find the late game Faith spells
[3:15:16] <+Critversity> theres a sorc combo that does over 50k damage
[3:15:18] <%Nobrev> sorceries desperately desperately need a range buff
[3:15:19] <sirrice77> or moon
[3:15:19] <%shootbang_exe> glintsgtone pebble is way too good compared to the spell that are supposed to "replace" it
[3:15:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think everything is better than everything else
[3:15:22] <dds333a> Just like the one in earlier games, or better?
[3:15:22] <dolphinbj> MLGS is dumby good in this game
[3:15:23] <penitentpendant> Janky!
[3:15:25] <rottingpastry> I prefer fast glintstone pebble whatever it's called
[3:15:29] <%Maids4lyfe> hopefully it won't be rebalanced into suck
[3:15:29] <+chimaera24> The sword of night and flame also has that kamehameha as it's weapon art
[3:15:30] <@QueequegTheater> Fire 36
[3:15:32] <TwistParabola> lmao
[3:15:36] <+CatRidder> who need the cat ring
[3:15:36] <BigFingerRo> OH SHIT THAT WOULD'VE KILLED YOU IN OTHER SOULS GAMES
[3:15:36] <+hakumaribo> what the hell are those things up there?
[3:15:36] <+FerdytheNerdy> What's the name of that new spear that he has????
[3:15:39] <notmilician> I just think faith weapons got spoiled here as opposed to sorcery weapons. Feels like a lot of the crazy cool weapons have faith requirements/scaling.
[3:15:47] <oda_flobunaga> Beast Claw
[3:15:51] <%Valdorick> @Maids4lyfe Rebalanced into Lightning Spears from DS2
[3:15:53] <%Puhff> It is odd that Sorcery seems to only have one damage type, Magic, while Faith gets fire, lightning, black fire, bleed and all kinds of shit
[3:15:59] <Manwad> int has the moonlight greatsword
[3:16:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Yeah, you pop leyline, drink the PHysick that makes spells cost no mana for 5~ seconds, then blow a boss up with the kamehameha.
[3:16:03] <blue8moon> so many cool sorceries are high int and my int's not high enough to use them :(
[3:16:10] <Omenaire_> int scales really well with most staffs
[3:16:11] <notmilician> Funny, I guess it's always a grass is greener situation, huh?
[3:16:11] <eleskei> fromsoft tryna make church cool
[3:16:13] <%Maids4lyfe> @Maids4lyfe Nooooooooooooo NotLikeThis
[3:16:20] <coziestbank> Sorcery gets Frost and Instant Death
[3:16:20] <@QueequegTheater> Moonslice Katana is better than anything faith gets
[3:16:21] <%crimsonharvest> does the horse ever get powerups
[3:16:22] <+Pachi3000> LUL
[3:16:22] <rottingpastry> I found the sword that takes 24 int and 24 faith, and I'm like...damn it
[3:16:24] <sirrice77> but judgement cut katanas are int, and theres cool int swords of all kinds
[3:16:24] <%JoshManVGH> Faith seems to have a lot more utility, that doesn't punish you for having magic weapons.
[3:16:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:16:29] <penitentpendant> I mean 'death' is start over from Grace
[3:16:32] <dds333a> @eleskei always have been
[3:16:33] <Sunstalker> there are so many weapons i can't use because they have this minimal INT req but it's a waste of the levels
[3:16:36] <+678saintglock> int has moonveil and that’s all you need fr
[3:16:37] <rottingpastry> Right after I leveled into moonveil katana
[3:16:37] <doster504> @Puhff to be fair sorc gets like the most powerful debuff which is ice
[3:16:41] <%Valdorick> @coziestbank To be fair, Faith gets Frost too
[3:16:43] <tauruslul> pure strength builds FTW
[3:16:45] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @rottingpastry That sword is incredibly overpowered. Like, strongest weapon in the game strong.
[3:16:50] <+FerdytheNerdy> Pat, what's the name of that spear drill you just got????
[3:16:50] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, I'm doing Faith Arcane and have some really cool shit
[3:16:51] <+NeonFishFace> oh
[3:16:53] <%fat_burtreynolds> Caught your zipper on the fence
[3:16:53] <Ell1ot> can butt slam stop fall damage?
[3:16:56] <Zourath> @Puhff Sorc also gets ice and fire.
[3:17:03] <mrtanaka111> how did they put so many interesting weapons in this game
[3:17:09] <+thickshield> faith seems to get a lot of cool stuff early on, int gets it later but boy are those things good
[3:17:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Coooked
[3:17:14] <coziestbank> I wanna see a Madness Build with that spear from the church near the frenzy village
[3:17:19] <doster504> @coziestbank wait really? outside of the frozen spear cause I don't really see it popping the debuff often
[3:17:24] <rottingpastry> Yeah, I saw a video about it after I found it while trying to open up the Liurnia map
[3:17:32] <+ATorL> @coziestbank *kind* of, I wouldn't say that Frost Lightning Spear is that good though
[3:17:36] <+Pachi3000> LUL
[3:17:37] <coziestbank> Actually two Madness build users working together with their AOEs should be crazy

[3:17:48] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt remember that night boss MoFo with the psychic controlled sword?  You get that with arcane
[3:17:49] <dds333a> CT was QUICK on that one
[3:17:51] <%pabloelenano2> you finally what?
[3:17:54] <ebrion> Depth Perception failed
[3:17:56] <+Fetrigon> @mrtanaka111 mix and match from previous games
[3:17:58] <+badhaye> The moonveil katana with its magic scaling feels incredible
[3:18:02] <morow1ec> it's raining horses today
[3:18:05] <rottingpastry> I think sorcery gets one fire spell, and it requires faith, right"?
[3:18:12] <+Kyma1020> Anthony Howell is the guy
[3:18:12] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt you are now Wile E Ciyote
[3:18:12] <%Puhff> Oh that's why he sounded familiar!
[3:18:22] <%Nobrev> I have so many cool sorceries that are absolutely useless because they do no damage and have ridiculous int requirements and fp costs and are only a little bit farther reaching than melee
[3:18:28] <%JoshManVGH> But I got the Moonveil, however I can't use the sorcerery weapon buff on it. Same for having a magic shield. So the only support spells I can use is "parry magic" and "suck magic into a hole"
[3:18:32] <sirrice77> @rottingpastry i have 4 but they do all require some faith yeah
[3:18:37] <%Valdorick> 10/10
[3:18:40] <+Pachi3000> amazing

[3:33:35] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @BigFingerRo might seem like it because the open ended nature means you can run into hour 3 bosses at hour 83
[3:33:35] <pi_in_the_sci> So you're just not fighting it?
[3:33:39] <roguemephilesclone> You were pretty close there, dude.

[3:38:56] <dds333a> Alfred but not half as cool, or justified
[3:38:57] <%Valdorick> If you kill him, you get his armor and sword
[3:38:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Grrm here’s
[3:39:01] <+pectusumbra> he's just going to kill himself I guess
[3:39:02] <+Ravenian96> nobody tell him he failed
[3:39:03] <sirrice77> i think he saw her and assumed she was sleeping and just stabbed her without checking

[3:40:02] <MillaMoks> oh they were conjoined twins, that explains the armour

[3:40:06] <%genepark> Oh shit that’s niiiice
[3:40:06] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that deathbed ending is super fucked because the implication is everyone will turn into hollows basically

[3:41:03] <%Valdorick> which is a theme with the high faith spells
[3:41:10] <heartlesshealer> it's a sun burst
[3:41:10] <tanarath> Many, MANY spells suck
[3:41:11] <%cade_calrayn> What boss did he just kill?

[3:41:19] <%VictorVonLouche> You got fia's outfit too
[3:41:19] <+extantCadence> Seems like a spell that only exists to be really annoying when that one boss is using it against you
[3:41:23] <pi_in_the_sci> No, THE DRAGON LORE
[3:41:24] <%Valdorick> And don't forget to check the boss weapons

[3:41:52] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> It actually does alot of damge but it seems like it was bugged when I used it sometimes it would melt things and then sometimes it would do barely any damage to the same thing even though it definately hit
[3:41:55] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> no hes not a conjoined twin
[3:42:03] <peachy996> Nerd

[3:42:16] <peachy996> Eh.
[3:42:26] <sothatsprettybrutal> the "enter the dream" just being an immediate drop into a dragon bossfight is pretty wild

[3:42:53] <TheBlankAce> You will want to dupe this one
[3:42:55] <%Canorius> they wouldnt be described as having “two bodies” but one soul if they were conjoined wouldnt they?

[3:44:31] <%geekjacob> no
[3:44:31] <%itstreylar> theres no debuff for the radiant one
[3:44:32] <pi_in_the_sci> I don't think that one gives you a debuff

[4:25:32] <%twohitgood> was that an item on the ground or a candle?
[4:25:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i always confuse them for items
[4:25:35] <%DeadRuins> it was on the floor
[4:25:36] <%TheGuesty> it looked like a spot on the ground before the warp out
[4:25:37] <XxMoliciousxX> misbegotten and the damnned?
[4:25:43] <%luftraumm1> i think candle
[4:25:45] <vile_brand> look with your elven eyes

[4:26:22] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> that drop was the M16
[4:26:23] <%dekkitout> Better question, does the item A) let you use your red lightning sooner or B) replace Tiche Kappa
[4:26:29] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt want directions?
[4:26:44] <%Puhff> the titty mariner???
[4:26:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> checked the replay, it was a candle

[4:27:05] <heartlesshealer> boatman should be fun once you find it
[4:27:09] <NewWillinium> *Drums hand on table*  I just found the coolest base weapon in a random dungeon. A "Cross Nagitana". With a wholly unique moveset too

[4:28:13] <%pabloelenano2> he is a white fatalis basically

[4:29:10] <roguemephilesclone> Peace.
[4:29:10] <jubejube56> They heal somehow
[4:29:11] <%abakkus> dragon bitched out smh
[4:29:11] <TwistParabola> gg
[4:29:11] <ExpressNode> He fucked in as he fucked off
[4:29:12] <stevenellis386> all these goddamn dragons!
[4:29:15] <%cade_calrayn> You'll see him again soon
[4:29:15] <VallerinTerra> Now go find phase 2
[4:29:16] <+Fetrigon> cucked
[4:29:16] <Glockroach2774> dragon a bitch
[4:29:17] <%aram909> YOU DIDNT WIN YOU DIDNT WIN
[4:29:24] <%geekjacob> remember the other dragon did that do?
[4:29:24] <ape_hawk> ADAC = all dragons are cowards
[4:29:25] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "I aindt messing with that"
[4:29:26] <TwistParabola> lmao
[4:29:27] <rommlll> he chose peace
[4:29:30] <%dekkitout> I bet next time he has a red lightning sword PunOko
[4:29:31] <jell_ree> it got no balls? get it
[4:29:31] <%luftraumm1> so, wait, is that the same dragon that was corrupted?
[4:29:34] <%captain_thickthighs> pussed out like a bitch
[4:29:34] <Gray_LoFi> If I had a nickel for every time a dragon bitched out, I'd have two nickels -- which isn't a lot but it's weird it's happened twice
[4:29:35] <%geekjacob> to
[4:29:36] <+maria_luke> he cowarded out or out of bounds?
[4:29:41] <toulon_somberjade> Well that is a girl dragon
[4:29:48] <TwistParabola> @luftraumm1 different
[4:29:54] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt but do you like the dragon's overall?
[4:29:54] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @luftraumm1 no, she's the lichdragon's sister
[4:29:59] <%aram909> @maria_luke he cowarded out, this happened to me too,as well as with one other dragon
[4:30:06] <%dekkitout> What we have he is a cowardly dragon, stuck between two different forms of cowardice
[4:30:08] <%luftraumm1> oooo sister, got it
[4:30:13] <Oscarthemowerman> wish they at least had a flying animation, the disappear made me think it was a bug or reset
[4:30:14] <rommlll> Slay! slay the dragon!
[4:30:19] <oda_flobunaga> deff cooler
[4:30:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The ancient ones are more traditional dragons where as the early ones are Wyvern Dragons
[4:30:34] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt That's good, cause the last one's gonna be dragon their balls all over your face.
[4:30:38] <Glockroach2774> Watching Pat makes me wanna get this game. He makes it look so easy
[4:30:39] <roguemephilesclone> Admittedly, if I saw a puny human start floating, transform into one of my brethren, and start emanating gas that I can feel killing me RIGHT away...
[4:30:45] <ape_hawk> the only thing i remember from DA:I dragons is that they were fun to fight and they were all weak to bees
[4:30:45] <%hereiam407> Clap
[4:30:46] <vile_brand> the lore of the game just makes me think this is just the FromSoftverse
[4:30:49] <rommlll> orange town
[4:30:51] <$realm_forge> My favorite Skyrim mod adds a bunch of dragon types like this to the game and it’s a blast
[4:30:53] <%abakkus> god dam
[4:30:53] <Omenaire_> BEAUTIFUL
[4:31:02] <roguemephilesclone> That
[4:31:03] <rommlll> botiful
[4:31:13] <%aram909> has pat done the volcano manor stuff yet?
[4:31:14] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait how did he get to the volcano without going through the city?
[4:31:17] <%quantras6> owo9,
[4:31:17] <roguemephilesclone> That's like the size of the Weeping Peninsula.
[4:31:18] <TwistParabola> our home, bathed in rays of gold
[4:31:23] <roguemephilesclone> That's an IRL city.
[4:31:26] <+AcidRelic> I bet it's going to feel even bigger with the inside verticality and rooms ext..
[4:31:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Glockroach2774 I got it because of the playthrough. Like I was iffy but it looked and is very fun. Evemn when you die
[4:31:48] <rommlll> get trolled
[4:31:52] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt do you plan on doing Satan this stream since you're stronger than the last time you tried him?
[4:31:55] <%abakkus> ye
[4:31:56] <%cade_calrayn> Nah, you gotta approach this ruin from the Lift to the east, Pat
[4:31:56] <%hereiam407> A little
[4:31:58] <ExpressNode> Ye
[4:31:58] <%hereiam407> Yes
[4:31:58] <thehiphophado> what if you get to the Erdtree & it's another massive area
[4:31:59] <%luftraumm1> probs bove
[4:32:00] <%sniffy77> yea
[4:32:00] <eleskei> tinkly tankly
[4:32:00] <%geekjacob> ye
[4:32:01] <pi_in_the_sci> ye
[4:32:02] <%notsoy> yep, must be up top
[4:32:02] <sweatch0> liar ahead
[4:32:04] <%cade_calrayn> It's at the top of the cliff
[4:32:08] <TwistParabola> probably in the higher up parts
[4:32:25] <%hereiam407> Lil Goblins
[4:32:27] <rottingpastry> I wish my liver was lightning proof
[4:32:31] <ape_hawk> just what i needed: a liver thats lightningproof
[4:32:40] <%cade_calrayn> You have to follow the cliff all the way to the east
[4:32:54] <Glockroach2774> The next game gonna have AC mechs lol
[4:33:12] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the actual ruins with interesting stuff are on top
[4:33:19] <%cade_calrayn> Damn I could never make that jump.
[4:33:25] <%cade_calrayn> And I tried so many times lol
[4:33:34] <rottingpastry> speedy tinkle
[4:33:42] <+Grayhammatter> teleporter
[4:33:53] <%cade_calrayn> I *think* it's still around here, though, it ports around
[4:33:58] <+Grayhammatter> those scarabs suck
[4:34:02] <%cade_calrayn> Could be wrong
[4:34:30] <Glockroach2774> When you die I'm the AC universe this one becomes your hell
[4:35:32] <rottingpastry> I just use ranged shit on those assholes
[4:35:38] <Oscarthemowerman> does re loading the game bring them back?
[4:35:41] <vile_brand> i've noticed enemies that have drops give off a sound
[4:35:44] <rottingpastry> hey, it's another one of you
[4:35:49] <$realm_forge> Do they stay in the area or are they just gone?
[4:35:53] <%cade_calrayn> Jesus CHRIST, that summon
[4:36:04] <rommlll> babe?
[4:36:04] <+NeonFishFace> oh
[4:36:07] <%hereiam407> Big noises
[4:36:07] <rottingpastry> if an enemy drops something, it leaves a white trail of mist when it dies
[4:36:09] <penitentpendant> The stompening
[4:36:10] <%TheGuesty> in the ass
[4:36:10] <eleskei> o
[4:36:15] <+Grayhammatter> that summon is big busted
[4:36:18] <roguemephilesclone> She's a pretty (dead) lady.
[4:36:19] <+Kharinite> gg
[4:36:30] <%RealThiele> pat might be overleveled
[4:36:32] <+CatRidder> torch up
[4:36:36] <jubejube56> That was your Queen?
[4:36:36] <roguemephilesclone> That summon is INCREDIBLY busted.
[4:36:49] <roguemephilesclone> Kirby/Zelda Sword Beam
[4:36:57] <%dekkitout> The summon is built tf up btw
[4:37:17] <%abakkus> very on the nose
[4:37:23] <%aram909> what summon does pat have?
[4:37:38] <%dekkitout> Black Knife Assassin Tiche
[4:38:11] <DuckAlfred> TREE GOLDEN TREE
[4:38:31] <rottingpastry> other side of the tree I assume
[4:38:37] <%luftraumm1> question isnt this just the same as ubisoft towers though?
[4:38:41] <+universboy95> Have we hit Mt. Gelmir yet?
[4:38:56] <RyuuAoi> How many bosses have be beat so far today?
[4:38:58] <rottingpastry> less intrusive, and it doesn't mark anything really
[4:39:06] <%RealThiele> gelmir was skipped cause of volcano rya quest
[4:39:09] <kulmoth> overkill
[4:39:13] <%abakkus> just got a stream notice from a speedrunner i follow, looks like the speedrun routing is in full swing now. can't wait to see proper runs start to pop up
[4:39:16] <pi_in_the_sci> these's a  seed past those goons
[4:39:30] <+maria_luke> @luftraumm1 doesn't it provide more than a tower though? am I wrong?
[4:39:34] <jell_ree> they were on pilgrimage D:
[4:39:38] <%luftraumm1> @rottingpastry but it does serve the same purpose right
[4:39:43] <%Brassnarwhal> where is he rn?
[4:39:49] <rommlll> we wuz pilgrimz
[4:39:55] <rottingpastry> in that it reveals the map, yes.
[4:40:00] <Frostydough1> chat is it true that he steals a portion of your souls until you kill godrick?
[4:40:08] <Frostydough1> or margit my b
[4:40:18] <%luftraumm1> @maria_luke i'm thinking of getting the details of a map of a point ou have to reach, but it does make you explore more
[4:40:20] <NewWillinium> . .Oh right we still haven;t met Gold Head man.  I am really really looking forward to seeing what the Completionist Speed Run times are going to be
[4:40:24] <roguemephilesclone> Oh, that might be the Faith spell on the Sword of Night and Flame.
[4:40:37] <%hereiam407> Sick
[4:40:41] <rottingpastry> yeah, that would make sense
[4:40:42] <RyuuAoi> Did Pat get his kamehameha?
[4:40:43] <%cade_calrayn> that is the Road of Fuckery
[4:40:51] <Frostydough1> this game is a big
[4:40:59] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes
[4:41:00] <%cade_calrayn> Not to be confused with FuckYou Lane nearby
[4:41:07] <+lucky_icarus> I can't fucking believe a sword can do not 1 but 2 high level spells.
[4:41:11] <jubejube56> Wait there is a green lush normal town in the north?
[4:41:12] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[4:41:13] <WeebFever> It's a trek
[4:41:14] <%tetraes> kinda yeah
[4:41:16] <+thickshield> thats one way yes
[4:41:19] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt there's a jump pad near the icon on your map near the bridge
[4:41:19] <%shootbang_exe> yep lol
[4:41:19] <Khester824> No
[4:41:20] <%hereiam407> Looks like it, yeh
[4:41:21] <penitentpendant> Praise the shortcut!
[4:41:21] <NewWillinium> Basically
[4:41:22] <%null_the_exhero> yeah that's the long way
[4:41:23] <+Ynkubus_> one way
[4:41:25] <%sporeian94> there';s like a horse jump around there
[4:41:25] <@Spydurman> maybe
[4:41:25] <pi_in_the_sci> looks like you might also be able to go through the mine
[4:41:26] <+678saintglock> pretty much
[4:41:26] <blue8moon> you can go from the manor down
[4:41:27] <%RealThiele> thats one way theres a couple
[4:41:27] <+Grayhammatter> that sounds like ass
[4:41:35] <+thickshield> you can also use that valley there
[4:41:37] <%Brassnarwhal> you can go left side there are wind jumps @patstaresat
[4:41:40] <Sunstalker> I have found a Grace that is labeled, "9th Mt Gelmir Grace" D/ it is a long way
[4:41:46] <+Ynkubus_> theres at least two other ways
[4:41:49] <NewWillinium> That Valley is also dope
[4:41:53] <roguemephilesclone> And ANOTHER seed!
[4:41:53] <%Brassnarwhal> i went along the coast side to get to the volcano
[4:42:00] <%RealThiele> yea 9th base camp of gelmir LUL
[4:42:03] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I did the long way and it's actually pretty fun as there's a few bosses on the way to it
[4:42:03] <oda_flobunaga> purty
[4:42:09] <rottingpastry> welcome to banor bondo
[4:42:22] <%Nobrev> theres a couple places where you can collect 2 golden seeds per tree around the capital
[4:42:24] <partyshart> Those looked like alive dudes
[4:42:35] <%cade_calrayn> Did you ever get the Golden Seed on the bridge of the Academy, Pat?
[4:42:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You people? How dare you not take time to fight us
[4:42:49] <+maria_luke> @rottingpastry brain said "banor bongo"
[4:42:49] <%notsoy> he did iirc
[4:43:05] <rottingpastry> oh god, some of those actually drop good things fuck
[4:43:11] <%cade_calrayn> @notsoy cool, I remember him asking to be reminded, then left for date night so I never saw if he did
[4:43:13] <DuckAlfred> Dude, this map is so much more massive than I thought
[4:43:22] <roguemephilesclone> Oh snap, isn't that from the first invader?
[4:43:31] <$realm_forge> The next elder scrolls better be godlike if this is what it has to live up to
[4:43:44] <jbrachob> also your dagger
[4:43:44] <%G_476> also your old blood dagger
[4:43:49] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Kind of?
[4:43:50] <roguemephilesclone> I think it's on your old dagger!
[4:43:51] <%justcallmebobplease> @realm_forge It won't be, you know that.
[4:43:58] <%RealThiele> kinda wish below the description there was a tiny video of the move being used
[4:44:07] <$realm_forge> @justcallmebobplease I do…..
[4:44:08] <+Based_Moose> Pat I think you are too huge for this area
[4:44:08] <Sunstalker> realm_forge Totally different gameplay designs. Dumb comparision.
[4:44:10] <rottingpastry> what the fuck
[4:44:11] <MoonObscure> lol
[4:44:14] <+maria_luke> @realm_forge Yeah, that's not happening
[4:44:22] <akitanito> nice
[4:44:33] <akitanito> one shot?
[4:44:37] <%Nobrev> these trolls are super puny for some reason
[4:44:42] <%geekjacob> huh
[4:44:43] <%captain_thickthighs> got his dusty ass
[4:44:44] <WeebFever> this also happened to me, I think these dudes have the wrong health values
[4:44:45] <%TheGuesty> Are they Titans?
[4:44:46] <R3Roundabout> these giants are weird
[4:44:46] <oda_flobunaga> yeah, that happens here
[4:44:47] <%pabloelenano2> 980 hp only
[4:44:48] <+Grayhammatter> wait what?
[4:44:49] <+Maleicus> only 700 health weird
[4:44:49] <%dekkitout> Guess you're overleveled? zimeNoted
[4:44:50] <Gray_LoFi> Why are these giants peculiarly weak?
[4:44:53] <%RealThiele> MIGHT be overleveled
[4:45:05] <rottingpastry> this feels so much more alive than skyrim it's fuckin weird
[4:45:08] <+Grayhammatter> a teensy bit overleveled
[4:45:29] <+seaearthandsky> they don't give souls so I assumed they illusions that dude on the horse made
[4:45:34] <rottingpastry> I'm pretty sure every single one of these has a drop
[4:45:34] <+maria_luke> @rottingpastry but where's the lie, tho
[4:45:48] <+The_EL_Destino> certified freak 7 days a week
[4:45:56] <%RealThiele> the capitol is gonna make OCD go brrr it did for me jesus that place
[4:46:03] <Sunstalker> Now Dragons Dogma 2 on the other hand? That has to live up to this. D:
[4:46:24] <%za7az> Praise the lord
[4:46:33] <Parapattern> All Jesus Hours starting right here right now
[4:46:37] <%Brassnarwhal> PRAISE HIM
[4:46:39] <Chaos_Aether> Pure Zeus Build
[4:46:49] <roguemephilesclone> Oh man, Dragon's Dogma 2... what is that even going to be?
[4:46:50] <%Nobrev> sword of night and flame might be the best sword in the game but it doesn't really match your build
[4:46:53] <%Brassnarwhal> late night jesus juice
[4:46:53] <%cade_calrayn> Damn tree-hugging hippies
[4:46:57] <rottingpastry> all erdtrees are bastards
[4:47:01] <+maria_luke> Dragon's Dogma... Heard the name, never saw the game. 3rd person adventure?
[4:47:02] <%RealThiele> Dragons dogma 2 sweatin
[4:47:02] <%machshop> and jesus said "those who live by the sword are sick as hell dude"
[4:47:05] <%Dakuu75> what kind of ending Pat going for?
[4:47:14] <%Brassnarwhal> i think I'm gonna go with the madness ending, i like madness
[4:47:15] <%Saadi90> Wow. Babylon’s Fall is sitting at a 35 on Open Critic.
[4:47:26] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal Playing Blind I believe
[4:47:31] <Parapattern> The Faith stat is really just faith in yourself to kill God
[4:47:33] <rottingpastry> it looked not good when max was playing it
[4:47:35] <jbrachob> use the laser fists
[4:47:46] <vile_brand> whats your stats?
[4:47:47] <jubejube56> I do love erdtree and it’s cursed black flame
[4:47:51] <%barrakuta371> go for the butt stomp
[4:47:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Do you think using two weapons at once is a bad thing and you should always have a shield on?
[4:47:55] <%Dakuu75> @Parapattern words to live by
[4:47:59] <NewWillinium> Become the Strength Faith Build that was always meant to be
[4:48:02] <rottingpastry> siluria's tree is cool
[4:48:10] <%RealThiele> i mean holy erdtree root be COVERED in corpses
[4:48:13] <jubejube56> Could powe  put
[4:48:14] <+maria_luke> @jbrachob wait we actually have that??
[4:48:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium I've been here for every elden ring stream and people have said things that actually talk about endings where i just said a word that has no context
[4:48:20] <roguemephilesclone> @maria_luke Dragon's Dogma is a cool, experimental open-world action-RPG made by Capcom. Specifically, it's Skyrim by way of Hideaki Itsuno, the Devil May Cry guy.
[4:48:23] <jubejube56> Could power stand those maybe?
[4:48:24] <DuckAlfred> There he is!
[4:48:45] <jbrachob> @he does
[4:48:56] <rottingpastry> become the wolverine
[4:48:57] <roguemephilesclone> Dragon's Dogma does not have DMC's combat, but it does have a darn sight more involved combat than the average WRPG.
[4:48:59] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal *tilts head*  What? You asked what ending Pat is going for. I answered that he's mostly been playing  blind.
[4:49:05] <jbrachob> @maria_luke he does
[4:49:05] <+maria_luke> @roguemephilesclone That sounds awesome. Ill have to give it a look.
[4:49:09] <Willowight> the faith claws
[4:49:10] <morkelebmink> are you duel wielding lightsabers?
[4:49:14] <+lucky_icarus> Those are fucking monk weapons from FF14
[4:49:14] <+Grayhammatter> ah, good ol cipher pata
[4:49:15] <ExpressNode> Priest assassin
[4:49:17] <psychoteletubby7> the running attack on those is ridiculous
[4:49:19] <roguemephilesclone> Yo, the Faith claws! I was there when you picked them up!
[4:49:33] <%dekkitout> Whichever ending "scrape the map" yields
[4:49:35] <jacksawjack> Duelwielding Sshwartzes
[4:49:47] <+maria_luke> @jbrachob man, I wish I didn't have a toaster PC...
[4:49:49] <+Grayhammatter> dual wielding words
[4:49:58] <%cade_calrayn> Pat has become hippy ginger Wolverine
[4:49:58] <Sunstalker> Miners tend to be pretty damn weak too
[4:49:58] <%barrakuta371> these guys are weak to magic
[4:49:59] <ExpressNode> It isn't upgraded so they must be weak
[4:50:01] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium i literally didnt ask anything i said what i was doing
[4:50:06] <%RealThiele> Yes
[4:50:14] <ape_hawk> PAT KICKS ASS FOR THE LORD!!!
[4:50:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What are they?
[4:50:20] <roguemephilesclone> If I saw this man running towards me, I would kneel and start screaming my surrender.
[4:50:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Item
[4:50:33] <Willowight> that weapon looks so fun
[4:50:40] <jbrachob> THE WORD OF THE LORD made into assasincreed blades
[4:50:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium sorry for the misunderstanding
[4:50:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt have you seen Patches recently?
[4:50:48] <rottingpastry> a weapon is "weak" in this game if it doesn't do 4000 damage with its weapon art
[4:50:49] <johndoe0920> you look like a zealot from starcraft.
[4:50:53] <roguemephilesclone> Oh boy, there ARE +1 talismans.

[4:57:40] <%cade_calrayn> You need the *somber* smithing stones ball bearings, Pat?
[4:57:41] <%OrangeMDT> Vaati made a video about getting unlimited smithing up to 6
[4:57:41] <rottingpastry> can't be killed by enemies if I kill myself
[4:57:43] <%za7az> Genius Patjumbo
[4:57:44] <NewWillinium> Behind a LOT of illusionary walls

[4:58:01] <%dekkitout> MITCH!
[4:58:10] <+FiresideInternetCafe> What sword is that?
[4:58:13] <$realm_forge> Any other prop maker types in here know if any of the 3D models for the weapons have started popping up?
[4:58:13] <%TG_Cid11> its near the end sorry to tell you
[4:58:23] <rottingpastry> stop stop he's already dead

[4:58:46] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt did you notice when fighting Tiche's dad that move took some of your MAX hp?
[4:58:49] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt If you're looking for the Somber 5-6 bearing, it's the First Church of Marika on the plateau. Just keep exploring outside of the city
[4:58:50] <Gray_LoFi> Yaaaaas Tiche slay
[4:58:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the Chichen weapon
[4:59:01] <%TG_Cid11> no
[4:59:02] <+CatRidder> why even attack
[4:59:02] <partyshart> Will Pat ever fight a boss again?
[4:59:13] <%TG_Cid11> its near the end of the story
[4:59:26] <+Hyphixsys> T
[4:59:29] <rottingpastry> protip to save all of one second when dealing with markers: just hit x twice
[4:59:30] <NewWillinium> I think you get that in the Dungeon next tot he Capital entrance
[4:59:33] <+Ravenian96> i have all the bells except the one you're looking for LOL
[4:59:33] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Selia Crystal cave has a lot of 5s
[4:59:34] <%cade_calrayn> That's the Zamor Ruins. No fucking idea where that is
[4:59:36] <%TG_Cid11> you have not unlocked thplace
[4:59:45] <+CatRidder> wiki it up
[4:59:47] <Sunstalker> Hunk_Of_Dunk There's multiple sects of faith folk though. Some revere holy, some lightning, some fire, some dark fire and some even dragons.
[4:59:52] <%RealThiele> the place in caelid mines ahs a lot
[4:59:53] <rottingpastry> hannibal burress vibes
[4:59:58] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cade_calrayn Snow Giant area in the north.
[5:00:00] <%Dakuu75> oh, I wanna watch him find this because really wish I could buy higher tier smithing stones
[5:00:02] <%TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt its after the capital
[5:00:05] <+Fenrisulfr_V> First one you go to.
[5:00:08] <%cade_calrayn> ooof
[5:00:13] <%hereiam407> Snow giant
[5:00:14] <%cade_calrayn> yeah it's post-Capital
[5:00:23] <+Bukky_> yep
[5:00:25] <%RealThiele> this guy is a pushover
[5:00:27] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> no
[5:00:27] <+Bukky_> just got it
[5:00:29] <%greasypete00> capital isn't the end of game
[5:00:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yeah, upgrading regular weapons is fucked
[5:00:35] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> NO THATS WRONG
[5:00:36] <Sunstalker> I haven't been in capital and my morningstar is +14 LuL
[5:00:36] <%JonathLP> Almost halfway Pat. Good job today.
[5:00:40] <+Ravenian96> special weapons OP
[5:00:40] <%dekkitout> Why is that such so?
[5:00:41] <toulon_somberjade> I got a +15
[5:00:46] <%TG_Cid11> you are talking about smithing bell bearing 3 right?
[5:00:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> anyone else unable to launch elden ring because steam keeps saying it needs to restart?
[5:00:49] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Caelid is supposed to be done after the capital, too.
[5:00:51] <+Ynkubus_> you can get up to atleast 8 before the capitol, I have a claymore at 8
[5:00:51] <coziestbank> They want you to have "easy" upgrades long after your "first" upgrades
[5:00:58] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> My Flail is at 13 and I havent beaten the capital
[5:01:06] <+ConnieETC> Question, For the known 6 endings do you have to through NG+ to see them all?
[5:01:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NICE
[5:01:12] <rottingpastry> pushed over
[5:01:18] <NewWillinium> Fuck you do so much damage
[5:01:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> that is VERY wrong
[5:01:19] <%Nekros4442> @fenrisulfr_v thats bs
[5:01:20] <+Ravenian96> NORTHERN caelid
[5:01:23] <dante_must_die_exe> no believe it tho
[5:01:27] <+HuoShengdi> Northeast Caelid, yeah
[5:01:28] <%Nekros4442> no waybis caelid after the capital
[5:01:29] <Sunstalker> Fenrisulfr_V That doesn't make sense though, the early zones of calid are not hard enough for that
[5:01:36] <%RealThiele> level wise yea
[5:01:39] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt Stone 5 is dropped by soldiers in the city, and there's plenty of 6 in the capital too
[5:01:39] <toulon_somberjade> There is a bell bearing south of the capital by the minor eldtree church in a tunnel
[5:01:43] <+extantCadence> Some areas in Caelid have really strong enemies
[5:01:43] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> lots of mats on walls in caves
[5:01:49] <%connorfromearth> talisman
[5:01:49] <%RealThiele> sneaky vial
[5:01:49] <+extantCadence> For whatever reason
[5:01:50] <coziestbank> is that for perfume crafting?
[5:01:50] <+stabethadeathwhisperdraws> wait but you need to go to ne caelid for the medallion tho
[5:01:52] <+natjen8> the question is whether redahn is supposed to be done before the capital or after
[5:01:54] <+thickshield> think its a tally
[5:01:56] <%RealThiele> its a talisman
[5:01:57] <+Ravenian96> QUIET talisman
[5:02:03] <+HuoShengdi> the northeast part of caelid is significantly higher level than the rest
[5:02:14] <+natjen8> @stabethadeathwhisperdraws you dont need the medallian to get into caelid though
[5:02:24] <+natjen8> err into the altus plateau
[5:02:25] <+HuoShengdi> I think you're supposed to do redmane normally before the capital and do the festival after
[5:02:25] <+natjen8> typo
[5:02:31] <NewWillinium> You Need Smithing Stones 4 Right? That let you upgrade to +12?
[5:02:45] <%cade_calrayn> ugh this place
[5:02:45] <+Ravenian96> It's castle super plague
[5:02:45] <coziestbank> With four tailismans sneak ass thieves getting both visibiity and sound tailismans is kind of crazy
[5:02:49] <%cade_calrayn> I've avoided it so far
[5:02:51] <WeebFever> yeahhhHHH POISON

[5:03:30] <+akita_opal> It's a stinky butthole castle
[5:03:34] <%Dakuu75> it looks very nice on the map. XD
[5:03:35] <zachztb> The dude in that castle don't mess around
[5:03:36] <%TheGuesty> "I just love poison swamps!"
[5:03:39] <%RealThiele> just a little extra swamp, as a treat
[5:04:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ok i've checked online, steam is currently caught in a restart loop when trying to launch elden ring. so anyone else playing on pc, gotta wait a bit until you can play again.
[5:04:13] <%mythcreant> and then there's that guy
[5:04:14] <+thickshield> her weapon is pretty sick
[5:04:14] <DuckAlfred> GRACE

[5:04:22] <%dekkitout> Is that a whole ass rot sword?
[5:04:23] <+Ravenian96> you're only about 10-15 overleveled tbh
[5:04:27] <%kujofire990> I STARTED STABBIN
[5:04:27] <%notsoy> you can't overlevel eating 10 shots to the chin
[5:04:31] <+CatRidder> shit hits hard

[5:04:50] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt Millicent is on the hill above the Erdtree-Gazing Hill grace, if you haven't talked to her

[5:05:10] <jacksawjack> Wretch soul lvl 1
[5:05:11] <%shootbang_exe> not even that far

[5:05:17] <sirrice77> No shes like right next to it
[5:05:19] <%shootbang_exe> just a bit north, within line of site of spawn
[5:05:20] <%dekkitout> How many more hits till he can use that raw snake egg?
[5:05:22] <%cade_calrayn> Just head north from that grace and you'll see her

[5:06:53] <%shootbang_exe> now talk to patches and the armored guy
[5:06:55] <NewWillinium> Now I believe the Armor guy sitting in the Dining Room becomes a merchant.
[5:07:01] <+aaymon86> She's evil.
[5:07:13] <%boggsz12> i'm so excited for you to fight rykard, he's such a fucking freak
[5:07:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> why does it sound like he just waits for people to get strong and then kills and loots them?
[5:07:32] <%greasypete00> media?
[5:07:33] <%cade_calrayn> That locked door? It's accessible via the secret passage, Pat
[5:07:37] <+Ravenian96> i think there is an npc you can talk to here now that you've killed those npcs
[5:07:39] <%mythcreant> h
[5:07:40] <%dekkitout> ...
[5:07:45] <%cade_calrayn> Just keep following the secret hallway around and you'll get into the locked room

[5:08:58] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I honestly stopped bothering at this point and just killed the snake
[5:09:02] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the passage circles the entire block of rooms - the room with the staircase down to the lava has another exit
[5:09:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Patches wants you to do his job LUL
[5:09:13] <Omenaire_> can you kill patches early?
[5:09:25] <+Queenemereldas> is patches always a scumbag?
[5:09:29] <+Ravenian96> Magma Wyrm area
[5:09:30] <%dekkitout> Man, when they say "The Dark Brotherhood Forever" they mean it
[5:09:41] <T_Sasquatch> you can kill him the moment he appears LUL
[5:09:42] <NewWillinium> Magma Dragon Boss Room.
[5:09:43] <DusK_The_Stray> Jesus Christ this game is huge
[5:09:47] <%connorfromearth> im level 81 and i just beat the first tree sentinel in the game
[5:09:56] <+Ravenian96> It's next to the grace ez
[5:10:19] <T_Sasquatch> This games scale makes no sense, 60 bucks for this almost feels criminal
[5:10:22] <LiterallyPerfect> when will pat face a boss
[5:10:33] <jacksawjack> isnt there a menu of icons
[5:10:47] <%mythcreant> @T_Sasquatch gonna wait. gonna wait hard.
[5:11:00] <%barrakuta371> I can't even imagine dlc for this game
[5:11:20] <+Ravenian96> did you kill the castellan? i don't remember
[5:11:29] <NewWillinium> What could they possibly DLC into this game?
[5:11:32] <WeebFever> I 100% feel that the three un-enter-able colosseums are going to be this game's DLC teleporters
[5:11:49] <NewWillinium> @Ravenian96 Nah the Poison Castellan killed Pat
[5:11:59] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Also talk to snake lady at the manor again, if you haven't already.
[5:11:59] <Sunstalker> I wonder if this is just the result of them not discarding a bunch of content like they usually do, but just embracing it and tying it together
[5:12:02] <+Ravenian96> ahhh gotcha ty

[5:12:43] <%jamsbybetty> her sword arm is not far if you wanna know where
[5:12:45] <%cade_calrayn> I think it's in the poison castle
[5:12:48] <%justcallmebobplease> Radahn was still alive, why is it surprising that Malenia's alive?
[5:12:52] <MartyFun11> iirc it's in the poison place you passed up
[5:12:53] <%JonathLP> Isn't malenia missing her sword arm?
[5:12:54] <LiterallyPerfect> does anybody know when this will get interesting? wheres the bosses

[5:19:31] <%OrangeMDT> Please take a break. I need to catch up
[5:19:36] <%shootbang_exe> babylon's fall is dead on arrival
[5:19:39] <%JoshManVGH> You could be one of the 650 players!
[5:19:42] <+disgruntledgruntle> @PatStaresAt How many illusory walls have you found so far?
[5:19:51] <+aaymon86> That Triangle Strategy game looks great
[5:19:54] <%hereiam407> It may be down to 200 by tomorrow
[5:20:05] <+Ravenian96> Later enemies have crazy amounts of hp
[5:20:15] <Sunstalker> You are 1 handing it afterall. And it's a regular greatsword, right? not an UGS?
[5:20:17] <RyuuAoi> Take Peach out on a date tomorrow. Buy her dinner and force her to see The Batman.
[5:20:18] <%JoshManVGH> What if ALL stats are lies this time around!
[5:20:21] <%hereiam407> LUL
[5:20:21] <%BlueLunecy> What if you had TWO Colossal Greatswords?
[5:20:23] <RyuuAoi> Smoke a blunt!
[5:20:25] <%hereiam407> Perfect timing
[5:20:26] <+SaintSalted> and will 2 shot no matter your health
[5:20:27] <%RealThiele> i do wonder if enemies have slight scaling
[5:20:30] <GeneralHysterics> what is this moveset, super interesting
[5:20:31] <%Dakuu75> what level is pat now?
[5:20:33] <%luftraumm1> you should try the UGS a bit eventually
[5:20:33] <+anthonypwndu> VoHiYo FortLlama FortHype sogCry
[5:20:50] <T_Sasquatch> babylons fall off sales more like it
[5:21:01] <%RealThiele> trap up ahead is what i used to murder this room
[5:21:01] <%Dakuu75> oh ok. I was in this one at level 73. it was rough
[5:21:05] <+678saintglock> damage numbers in this game are nuts
[5:21:08] <GeneralHysterics> that was a sick spell
[5:21:11] <GeneralHysterics> it did nothing??
[5:21:26] <ape_hawk> pat, if you wanna relax, Critical Role did a dnd one-shot based on Elden Ring you can sit back and watch
[5:21:48] <GeneralHysterics> wow, that guy got owned
[5:21:48] <DusK_The_Stray> Didn't block the overhead
[5:21:50] <partyshart> oh a tiny little grotesque
[5:21:51] <Sunstalker> Dakuu75 Oh you did this after beating the iron virgins? LuL I went the other way and it's a similar pain
[5:21:58] <+Ravenian96> boosts lighting, pretty good
[5:22:24] <Sunstalker> I saw a chest?
[5:22:34] <NewWillinium> That's a Oblivion Style Roof Trap I love it!
[5:22:40] <GeneralHysterics> oh my god, you're so much further than me
[5:22:53] <%Dakuu75> @Sunstalker I went back and did both paths, to here actually lol
[5:22:53] <NewWillinium> Yes!
[5:22:56] <GeneralHysterics> I've played like 50 hours and I'm nowhere near level 100
[5:22:59] <%jamsbybetty> you're gonna wanna look underneath that moving floor btw
[5:23:02] <NewWillinium> In Imperial Battle Mage
[5:23:14] <arcadianskypirate> I wish I could link that video. It's a classic LUL
[5:23:15] <%cascadepersona> Love that video
[5:23:20] <akitanito> mage's quest yeh
[5:23:39] <%Brassnarwhal> pat did you find the village that caught the dancing plague?
[5:23:40] <ape_hawk> is it trickier than rocking a rhyme?
[5:23:41] <%justcallmebobplease> Do it from the lower floor, duh
[5:23:47] <Jar704> Fought this dungeon early, such a pain in the ass
[5:23:48] <%justcallmebobplease> Why are you trying to go under, from the top?
[5:23:49] <Sunstalker> Dakuu75 It was damn weird going up the mountain path without the map unlocked. LuL It makes so little sense how you bounce between graces
[5:23:52] <+tizziks> from lower floor
[5:24:03] <T_Sasquatch> kek

[5:26:52] <%RealThiele> look the mushroom guys tried ok
[5:26:54] <deviljhojho_> OH. YOU.
[5:27:03] <majindusto> PAT AT RISK
[5:27:05] <%jamsbybetty> more time for us to watch Plague's LP then :P
[5:27:11] <%jamsbybetty> with his two hour parts
[5:27:11] <stevenellis386> wow that damage
[5:27:19] <imthewisejanitor> I AM PAZUZU
[5:27:25] <deviljhojho_> SMOOTH
[5:27:29] <RyuuAoi> You've put in a good week, Pat. Clocked in a lot of hours. You gotta take care of yourself!
[5:27:34] <GeneralHysterics> holy shit your summon is going hard
[5:27:39] <+meatpizza> i thought that boss was a cat lol
[5:27:42] <%justcallmebobplease> IS THAT GOING TO LET YOU BUY GLOVEWORT!?
[5:27:47] <ape_hawk> now you can buy gloveworts?
[5:27:49] <stevenellis386> pazuzu is now dead
[5:27:51] <+Ravenian96> yep
[5:27:52] <+CatRidder> its random
[5:27:54] <%BonewheelVanguard> in that there is non?
[5:28:04] <%justcallmebobplease> I CARE, I NEED EM AND I CAN GO HERE
[5:28:05] <+Ravenian96> pretty worthless tbh
[5:28:05] <ape_hawk> this game's progression is "lolrandom"
[5:28:10] <%RealThiele> its gets more confusing, not less as you go on
[5:28:11] <%jamsbybetty> upgrade the whole ass spirit world
[5:28:14] <+extantCadence> The ghost gloveworts are literally easier to find
[5:28:17] <$Emperor_Machinus> but the gloveworts...
[5:28:26] <Sunstalker> I think the game really expected us to beeline the main pretty road from stormveil through academy through Lift to capital.
[5:28:30] <%luftraumm1> i thnk you may have overexplored and thats a crazy concept
[5:28:33] <jubejube56> I would be fascinated to know what they intended the progression to ve
[5:28:36] <partyshart> pitfalls of an openworld
[5:28:37] <XxMoliciousxX> oh yeah I got a +15 legendary bussy
[5:28:41] <oda_flobunaga> There is an optimal intended path, but no direction whatsoever
[5:28:57] <ape_hawk> the fact i can get an s-rank sorc weapon in the first 10 minutes of the game is proof that theres no logical progression in the game
[5:29:09] <+extantCadence> I also don't get why the special weapons only require one of each stone type, while the regular weapons require 12 of each
[5:29:11] <+PkSilent01> I found a tweet that says there's a secret Pause Button in this game. Its UP, X, L1, X, LEFT, X
[5:29:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt What happens to the game if you never find any illusionary walls?
[5:29:28] <+Ravenian96> path is stormveil > liurnia > mt gelmir > atlas plateau on normal route
[5:29:36] <partyshart> I heard there's 80+ bosses so I don't see how there can be any sort of predicted play
[5:29:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think the Mt whatever is the intended path after Raya Lucaria, I feel like I'm the right level
[5:29:40] <%Maids4lyfe> there actually is a pause it's photo mode
[5:29:55] <+Ravenian96> caelid is weird
[5:30:00] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nope
[5:30:03] <ape_hawk> whats the normal route to gelmir?!?!
[5:30:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm definitely still getting my shit rocked in Caelid
[5:30:07] <+vaderxyz1970> No
[5:30:19] <Sunstalker> Mt Gelmir? Stuff onthe mountain top is pretty rough for directly after Rennala
[5:30:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you're supposed to get kidnapped
[5:30:24] <%JohnAtDawn> Caelid is fucked
[5:30:25] <+vaderxyz1970> after capital at least
[5:30:26] <+Javaa01> The photo mode is just turning the UI off
[5:30:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> going west through altus plateau
[5:30:29] <+Ravenian96> it's a path you haven't found i think
[5:30:30] <%luftraumm1> the intended path can't POSSIBLY be through patches bullshit teleport
[5:30:34] <%JohnAtDawn> It really needs to be patched
[5:30:41] <oda_flobunaga> I think the capital is next after Liurnia
[5:30:52] <coziestbank> Meeting Ranni feels like an "extra" path anyway
[5:31:13] <$Emperor_Machinus> the hero at the end
[5:31:16] <GeneralHysterics> did you just do 5k damage, wtf
[5:31:19] <imthewisejanitor> LUL tiny guy ran in for the kill
[5:31:19] <%boggsz12> it's odd, yeah. i honestly feel overwhelmed most of the time with all the shit i can go do
[5:31:22] <%geekjacob> yes
[5:31:24] <+Shimano232> that rapier? yeah
[5:31:24] <%JoshManVGH> It can be
[5:31:25] <rReizs> hels ya
[5:31:26] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt that is a rapier with rot on it by default
[5:31:32] <%TheAdMerlin> Ranni is apparently the true end, that's why she gives you the Moonlight Great sword and you marry her
[5:31:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> if you find the map for upper altus plateau you'll see the path to mt gelmir
[5:31:38] <%tetraes> yeah thats the scarlet rot rapier
[5:31:43] <+Shimano232> Rot-pier
[5:31:43] <+thickshield> i think it can take an ash as well
[5:31:44] <imthewisejanitor> A rotpier.
[5:31:48] <oda_flobunaga> I took it and added poison too
[5:32:03] <+Ravenian96> i mean you can craft scarlet rot grease
[5:32:07] <+Ravenian96> really easy
[5:32:12] <+maria_luke> never not overkill
[5:32:16] <coziestbank> IDK I think they want you to make ridiculously powerful stuff, look at the late spells
[5:32:19] <Sunstalker> I'm gonna go out on a limb and just assume they intended you to followed the big pretty road and then explore after, even though all the side content isn't levelled for something like that?µ
[5:32:27] <+maria_luke> ☆payback☆☆payback☆
[5:32:42] <GeneralHysterics> wow, you took his lunch money and his fit
[5:32:50] <+Ravenian96> think of caelid as two zones, one mid level, one super high level
[5:32:54] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt if you kill the huge dragon it gives you 5 dragon hearts and a new power
[5:33:00] <oda_flobunaga> in Caelid
[5:33:02] <coziestbank> It feels like they swapped the level ranges of enemeies with the mt/capital and caelid
[5:33:09] <Sunstalker> Caelid is like the weirdest because you get a teleport in LIMEGRAVE to the LAST SPOT in Caelid.
[5:33:26] <oda_flobunaga> Cool
[5:33:30] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I actually have a massive chart of what each zone's intended level and upgrade is.
[5:33:34] <kazadaz> Caelid is one of the places you can go before Stormveil right?
[5:33:37] <+maria_luke> thank fuck you didn't fall through the ground after that animation
[5:33:40] <rReizs> caelid is the result of an ever escalating 3 way arms race between the caelid faction, the rot faction, and the angry birds and dogs faction
[5:33:42] <%notsoy> hell yeah clipping jank
[5:33:43] <%jamsbybetty> difficulty seems dependent on your weapon too 'cause I am using powerstanced flails and it's getting rough
[5:33:44] <Omenaire_> theres a teleport in mistwood that goes to divine bridge
[5:33:51] <+Ravenian96> yep,  you can run straight to caelid
[5:34:06] <thehiphophado> is that blaidd's torso armor?
[5:34:14] <%Dakuu75> it's the rotting ANT-ASS sword
[5:34:23] <Sunstalker> kazadaz Stormveil doesn't lock off anything, you can just ride along the cliff next to the broken bridge. Stormveil is not a progression blocker aside fomr unlocking Enia.
[5:34:33] <+maria_luke> it's ☆perfect☆
[5:34:37] <oda_flobunaga> and it takes ashes
[5:34:37] <%dekkitout> Murder shroom is back in action
[5:34:41] <+Ryaotz> Think there was an item over there still
[5:34:43] <+Shimano232> And it can have whatever weapon are so ad bleed or poison base
[5:34:43] <oda_flobunaga> YES YOU CAN
[5:34:48] <kazadaz> yo dawg
[5:34:50] <+Ravenian96> it's silly
[5:34:51] <kazadaz> i heard
[5:34:51] <jubejube56> Stabby rot stabby rot
[5:34:54] <kazadaz> you like poison
[5:34:55] <%pabloelenano2> oh no
[5:34:56] <%Dapper_Cactuar> YEEEAAHHHH
[5:34:56] <ape_hawk> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[5:34:56] <Omenaire_> buffs stack like crazy in this
[5:34:57] <penitentpendant> Unlimited Status Works!
[5:34:59] <ape_hawk> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA
[5:35:04] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck
[5:35:04] <coziestbank> It does reduce the rot buildup a bit
[5:35:06] <rReizs> double dot baybee
[5:35:07] <%dekkitout> DEADASS GlitchNRG
[5:35:07] <Gray_LoFi> Oh that is a terrifying weapon
[5:35:08] <Ner234> That's fuckedd LUL
[5:35:08] <+Grayhammatter> LETS GO
[5:35:08] <GeneralHysterics> just awful
[5:35:08] <%greasypete00> it just works
[5:35:12] <+Shimano232> then buff it with a spell for the 3rd type.
[5:35:19] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt If you think that's nutty, I got a Flamberge with Bleed+Frostbite and the Wild Strikes Skill.
[5:35:21] <Omenaire_> i have fire poison
[5:35:22] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt with my build I'm getting over 100 poison build up on it
[5:35:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can have 3 of the 4 statuses if you dual wield it with a bleed rapier
[5:35:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> UH HUH UH HUH
[5:35:30] <%Bullet25fxbx> I want to see that in action
[5:35:32] <+marchums> marchums subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[5:35:33] <jacksawjack> Mihazachi Special
[5:35:33] <+Ravenian96> sickos: "hahahaha YESSS"
[5:35:36] <morkelebmink> you used the wrong word, hilarious, not awful
[5:35:42] <GeneralHysterics> the itch the freak scratched
[5:35:44] <+Shimano232> status shouldn't prevent buffs
[5:35:58] <kazadaz> It's gonna be terrifying when they patch to rebalance stats/skills
[5:36:00] <coziestbank> Use sleep grease and just watch them die on their own
[5:36:20] <+tizziks> what about greese?
[5:36:23] <+Shimano232> ok, well I tried. too far I guess
[5:36:29] <Slim_Lipid> maybe they made invasions opt-in because they realized they couldn't balance this bonkers shit for PvP LUL
[5:36:31] <Gray_LoFi> You can just powerstance with a bleed weapon I guess
[5:36:32] <coziestbank> Just NG+ and dual wield with bleeding on the other
[5:36:47] <Ner234> Get a second one and powerstance LUL
[5:36:49] <%luftraumm1> invade soemeone
[5:36:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @kazadaz various adjustments have been made
[5:36:52] <rReizs> i can feel hoarfrost getting the nerfhammer
[5:37:04] <%greasypete00> this is the only soulsy game where grease seems less useful than avtually building for casts or ash buffs
[5:37:08] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[5:37:16] <+Grayhammatter> immediately
[5:37:19] <coziestbank> DUAL WIELD
[5:37:21] <oda_flobunaga> It's dead and it doesn't even know it
[5:37:22] <ape_hawk> does rot override posion?
[5:37:37] <coziestbank> just visually
[5:37:37] <%Bullet25fxbx> try bleed, not poison
[5:37:41] <%Felhad> Rot/Blood probably better
[5:37:55] <coziestbank> why not both?
[5:37:56] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Now in an Arcane build, this gets even worse
[5:37:56] <%Dakuu75> how are these things so strong, even with an unupgraded weapon at lv 100
[5:38:00] <penitentpendant> Status stick then switch to 'real weapon'
[5:38:01] <%dekkitout> Get the few hits in for the shroom hat buff
[5:38:02] <+Ravenian96> hobo running at you with a syringe build
[5:38:02] <%geekjacob> yeah
[5:38:02] <%luftraumm1> to put the DOT on?
[5:38:10] <coziestbank> Poison on one, Bleeding on the other dual wield
[5:38:16] <jacksawjack> Frost/Blood
[5:38:21] <+thickshield> power stance that bad boy with a ice or bleed rapier and laugh as enemies explode
[5:38:22] <kinkade_77> blood seems verryyy good
[5:38:24] <jubejube56> It’s much safer than dragon breath
[5:38:28] <%snugglepuggs> Rot is superior to poison
[5:38:29] <+Javaa01> Rot+Bleed and fast stabs as a weapon art for instant proc on both
[5:38:37] <%Felhad> Grooooosss
[5:38:39] <%dekkitout> monkaS
[5:38:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH THAT'S WAY BETTER
[5:38:44] <+Grayhammatter> holy SHIT
[5:38:50] <%dekkitout> Much more preferable than the twinblade tbh
[5:38:50] <Sunstalker> Dakuu75 Weapon upgrades are the big power thing. It's where your scaling becomes so strong from
[5:38:52] <+LandOfTheWay> that is insane
[5:38:53] <GeneralHysterics> exCUSE ME
[5:38:53] <%JoshManVGH> That's madness
[5:38:55] <%Dakuu75> wait, I didn't get it, what changed?
[5:38:56] <AgnusLaplace> that's disgusting
[5:38:56] <kazadaz> i'm MELTIIIING
[5:38:57] <Slim_Lipid> MULTI-STATUS Kreygasm
[5:39:01] <valstriam> that's crazy wtf
[5:39:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> that's SICKENING
[5:39:04] <%spitelite> thats so fucked up
[5:39:05] <+CatRidder> give it frostbite too
[5:39:08] <%Bullet25fxbx> That thing is stupid, jesus
[5:39:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Dakuu75 weapon has bleed and rot, but also keeps the poison move
[5:39:27] <+tizziks> Rot built in, blood affinity, poision war art
[5:39:40] <Slim_Lipid> is stacking DoTs Big Number or Do Combo?
[5:39:44] <plaguedoctor_vi> and the stinking lines
[5:39:46] <%Felhad> That's pretty nuts
[5:39:47] <+Shimano232> Is there a weapon you could do bleed + frostbite on for the double pop?
[5:39:48] <%JoshManVGH> And blood proced
[5:39:52] <%Dakuu75> @Kevlar_Caviar ooooh, I see.
[5:39:55] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:40:01] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Just jumped on but you look even less of a Dragon Paladin now lol.
[5:40:03] <coziestbank> Ice needle?
[5:40:05] <%luftraumm1> do it on someone?
[5:40:07] <%geekjacob> thats sick
[5:40:16] <%JoshManVGH> BtW why do you have faithsabers equipped?
[5:40:17] <GeneralHysterics> sicko mode
[5:40:18] <haisho> damn that's disgusting
[5:40:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> That was fucking heinous
[5:40:25] <jacksawjack> Frost/Blood for double burst damage
[5:40:28] <Sunstalker> I think poison affinity is the easiest to not use because the poison throwing daggers are pretty fast and you can just rely on those. Where like the kukri for bleed are slower to throw
[5:40:31] <coziestbank> bleeding ice needle with bleeding rot rapier with poison art
[5:40:36] <+Ravenian96> @Shimano232 you can put frost scaling on reg weapons yes
[5:40:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @Shimano232 yea just add frost to any weapon with bleed
[5:40:39] <kazadaz> oh
[5:40:40] <+aaymon86> Ayo?
[5:40:44] <%snugglepuggs> Has Pat done the Giant Pot Invader NPC challenge yet? Cuz this could be S tier in that!
[5:40:46] <+Ravenian96> katana with bleed frost is totally doable
[5:40:55] <kazadaz> Mortal Blade
[5:40:58] <%luftraumm1> 3k huh
[5:41:10] <%luftraumm1> well you did a lot today
[5:41:11] <%TheLemuroid> It's been how many hours per day?
[5:41:14] <%dekkitout> Melded Brain
[5:41:17] <%boggsz12> have a nice night, Pat! thanks for the streams!
[5:41:17] <%Monkeyweed21> oh wow only 6 hours Pat must be getting old /s
[5:41:23] <%hereiam407> What are you talking about, you're playing Pokemon right now
[5:41:29] <%cade_calrayn> You killed several gods and dragons today
[5:41:30] <kazadaz> woah this place looks different
[5:41:36] <+Ravenian96> and frost scales with int so it's great for spellswords
[5:41:39] <kinkade_77> wait THATS A GRACE?

[5:42:16] <+Grayhammatter> yes, the table is a grace
[5:42:19] <%geekjacob> huh
[5:42:24] <+Ravenian96> arcane for status effects yeah
[5:42:29] <%hereiam407> hmmm
[5:42:34] <partyshart> respec time?
[5:42:39] <%dekkitout> Skim a little off the top
[5:42:39] <kinkade_77> volcano manor quest gives u a very good faith weapon
[5:42:43] <%Monkeyweed21> full caster build?
[5:42:43] <+Shimano232> What if?
[5:42:45] <jacksawjack> Bloodhound sword
[5:42:46] <%luftraumm1> mmm another weapon then?
[5:42:47] <%Felhad> im rocking 70 int right now on my build, big spell dmg
[5:42:50] <Ashenik1> guys, is pure str buil is a good idea?

[5:42:54] <%snugglepuggs> Wait Pat beat the Rot Dragon?! Was it this stream?
[5:42:54] <+Grayhammatter> what if
[5:42:55] <kazadaz> Moves like Jeezer
[5:42:59] <TIME_PUNCHER> George Michael build, you gotta have Faith
[5:43:00] <+Ravenian96> faith is for nerds tbh
[5:43:00] <XxMoliciousxX> mind and faith?
[5:43:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt your seal scales with strength no?

[5:43:44] <TIME_PUNCHER> my faith is all the strength I need /s
[5:43:58] <jubejube56> Wasn’t that strength and Dex for the godslayer?
[5:43:58] <+Ravenian96> they give you so many respec items i'm going back to respec one or points at a time to try different things
[5:43:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Pump arcane, faith and mind and become PRIEST
[5:44:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> pump only luck
[5:44:31] <kazadaz> That's a alien
[5:44:34] <plaguedoctor_vi> that my build right now except my is int, i have the minimal for my weapon have 25 for the health, stamina and FP, and the rest for int
[5:44:42] <kinkade_77> anyone know what the best faith weapon is yet
[5:44:44] <%Felhad> Is it wise to do a respec while you're brain fried, though?
[5:45:04] <%Felhad> lol
[5:45:08] <%snugglepuggs> Sell the duplicates
[5:45:20] <RyuuAoi> Don't forget Saturday, Pat! Sushi/Blunt/Batman/bubble bath/
[5:45:25] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> dupes dont sell for much
[5:45:35] <oda_flobunaga> Did Pat ever get the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Shield?
[5:45:36] <RyuuAoi> In dat ass
[5:45:38] <@QueequegTheater> Change into a mage build and pump to 70 INT
[5:45:44] <thehiphophado> from faith to pagan build
[5:45:44] <jubejube56> Also you did get another deathroot for the priest
[5:45:55] <+Ravenian96> you don't sell dupes for souls, you sell for cleaning bags
[5:45:57] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> reminder, you cant go any lower than your base stats
[5:46:03] <42nfl19> @oda_flobunaga unless there is another turtle shield, he rocked it for a bit in previous streams
[5:46:14] <oda_flobunaga> okay
[5:46:33] <42nfl19> WHAT ARE YOU MAKING HIM REMEMBER
[5:46:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> hungry doggo

[5:49:21] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt Less Mind? I knwo the Ashes are great but it's overkill to have both them and trying to be another build.
[5:49:21] <+Ravenian96> you get like 10 free respec items don't worry
[5:49:27] <kinkade_77> spec to a weapon with lower str requirement
[5:49:44] <RyuuAoi> Sunday grind? Off stream

[5:51:48] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cade_calrayn How do you feel about so many spells being "Glintstone Pebble but worse"?
[5:51:53] <%Felhad> I was regretting Astro early on but man Sorcery takes off later on
[5:52:08] <+Ravenian96> you got the faith incantation boosting talisman yet? it only gives like 20 or 30 dmg
[5:52:15] <+stabethadeathwhisperdraws> sorcery is lame until like mid game
[5:52:17] <%Felhad> @fenrisulfr_v The ones that aren't just that fuck tho
[5:52:22] <+Ravenian96> YEAH XD
[5:52:29] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Felhad Tru
[5:52:34] <+Ravenian96> sorc one is the same way
[5:52:35] <Sunstalker> The FP talisman gives like 4 FP LUL
[5:52:43] <%Dakuu75> doesn't iot give you like 5 free faith?
[5:52:58] <%Brassnarwhal> clutch rings is clutch rings they ain't worth mich
[5:52:58] <+Ravenian96> that's a different talisman
[5:53:02] <%Felhad> Blasting down a boss with a Kamehameha is the radest
[5:53:15] <Sunstalker> The stat boost talismans are just good for hitting requirements on spells
[5:53:27] <+meatpizza> still D faith scaling?
[5:53:44] <+Ravenian96> godslayer in for weapon art only tbh
[5:53:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you can switch view to see the damage
[5:53:59] <%dekkitout> The numbers mason
[5:54:00] <RyuuAoi> They reallly want you to be OP in ER
[5:54:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @meatpizza it goes to plus 25 it has to be a very broad curve
[5:54:07] <%greasypete00> scaling is a lie fuck you miyazaki
[5:54:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> is fromsoft lying about the scaling letters AGAIN?
[5:54:09] <%luftraumm1> one is fire one is holy
[5:54:10] <%Monkeyweed21> THE LETTERS ARE LIES AGAIN
[5:54:32] <%Felhad> Nah. Godslayer goes to +10, unique weapons all do
[5:54:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @luftraumm1 they both scale with faith though
[5:54:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @beatboxersdevmike always has been
[5:54:50] <%luftraumm1> ah fuck scaling letters fake again
[5:54:54] <42nfl19> why is she hugging a pumpkin?
[5:54:59] <Sunstalker> BeatBoxersDevMike Nah, the scaling on elemental things can apply to just special moves of the weapon, not the swing dmg
[5:55:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @felhad that's true but they were talking about the gargoyle sword is gargoyle sword somber or regular
[5:55:13] <Midnight188> how far is pat I just got here where is he
[5:55:28] <+Ravenian96> i forget
[5:55:30] <%Felhad> aha, was only listening, not sure on gargoyle
[5:55:33] <+meatpizza> does faith improve fire and lightning damage too?
[5:55:33] <Sunstalker> Brassnarwhal somber
[5:55:35] <%Dakuu75> don't remember.
[5:55:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @felhad sunstalker got us
[5:55:51] <RyuuAoi> 12 dex,  Pat?
[5:55:59] <%Felhad> lol
[5:56:06] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt hey pat people discovered there's unique dialogue if you attack ranni after giving her the ring and it's sad as shit
[5:56:13] <rosabellamelantha> you lose the MGS this way too
[5:56:24] <%luftraumm1> 2 more on STR?
[5:56:35] <RyuuAoi> Well commit
[5:56:36] <%Felhad> Fake fan
[5:56:40] <%Nobrev> moonlight greatsword
[5:56:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @rosabellamelantha from doesn't condone spousal abuse
[5:56:41] <%dekkitout> Moonlight Grearsword?
[5:56:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> moonlight greatsword?
[5:56:43] <rosabellamelantha> what I said in my above message
[5:56:47] <%greasypete00> do you think it would be better to break elemental damage down into individual elemental scaling would be better and then telling the player what stat affects that scaling? @PatStaresAt
[5:56:48] <@QueequegTheater> nanomachines
[5:56:52] <%Monkeyweed21> its MLGS dude
[5:56:58] <rReizs> its the major league gaming sword
[5:56:58] <%Brassnarwhal> it was 2 messages pat
[5:57:05] <+Ravenian96> there is a talisman that give you like 20 stats that i think you missed
[5:57:05] <%Felhad> Major League Gaming Sword
[5:57:10] <kinkade_77> mgs is int anyway
[5:57:11] <%Felhad> lol
[5:57:15] <%cade_calrayn> Technically in this game it's the DMGS
[5:57:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt can you use forbidden sun now?
[5:57:24] <%Dakuu75> that sounds like a lie...
[5:57:24] <RyuuAoi> Pat knows what he is doing. I trust him.
[5:57:27] <%Felhad> I think he has it?
[5:57:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you already got it
[5:57:30] <+Ravenian96> yeah it's like prisoner chain
[5:57:30] <%cade_calrayn> Radagon's Soreseal, maybe?
[5:57:30] <%Felhad> Soreseal
[5:57:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @ravenian96 the scar seal thing? he has 2 of them
[5:57:35] <rosabellamelantha> Dialogue is as follows "I see... Thee has finally show thy true color? Of course...It makes sense ....What was I expecting..." @PatStaresAt
[5:57:38] <kinkade_77> so far.....
[5:57:40] <+Ravenian96> ahhhhh
[5:57:42] <%Brassnarwhal> @ravenian96 he has 2
[5:57:42] <Sunstalker> I think he means the Great Rune?
[5:57:43] <+Ravenian96> he has it
[5:57:44] <@QueequegTheater> It increases damage though
[5:58:01] <%cade_calrayn> Radagon's Soreseal is the one that boosts all but increases damage, yeah, it's the better version of the Scarseal
[5:58:16] <%Felhad> You take quite a bit more but its so many stats if you just git gud
[5:58:24] <+Ravenian96> only like 10% more dmg for like 250 health tho
[5:58:28] <%Brassnarwhal> the ruler hat gives faith too @patstaresat
[5:59:06] <luciluxlu0> there is one spell in the game that takes only faith
[5:59:11] <Midnight188> has Pat been to Altus Plateau?
[5:59:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @midnight188 yes but he's not finished it
[5:59:41] <+Ravenian96> yeah he's exploring atlus
[5:59:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its on the place with a bunch of carriages
[5:59:46] <%Brassnarwhal> it's at the beginning of altus plateau
[5:59:54] <%Brassnarwhal> in the knocked over carriages
[5:59:57] <Midnight188> okie 👌 I wanted to know where he was since I just got home
[6:00:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Its next to the Longma
[6:00:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just saw a message "Bloodstain? Seek skill" with the edge lord gesture
[6:00:20] <ArgentUndaCova> Woah, where did Pat get that Albernauric face mask?
[6:00:33] <+Ravenian96> yeah big spell big slots
[6:00:41] <%Brassnarwhal> Just in case you needed the charm slot later it could hit requirements
[6:01:03] <%Brassnarwhal> big hit
[6:01:11] <RyuuAoi> Good
[6:01:14] <+Ravenian96> i honestly wish more spells used more slots i have too many memory stones
[6:01:23] <%Brassnarwhal> huge damage
[6:01:23] <doster504> wait do regular swings apply the burn?
[6:01:29] <%Brassnarwhal> excellent sword
[6:01:33] <%luftraumm1> !!!!
[6:01:35] <%dekkitout> PogChamp
[6:01:37] <doster504> WAIT THAT SPELL
[6:01:38] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I heard that Dex increases your spell casting speed, does that also affect "spells" from skills?
[6:01:42] <doster504> FUCK OFF
[6:01:42] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt Shaded Castle is dropping tons of Smithing Stones 5-6 for me, it may be worth making that your next stop if you still need those
[6:01:45] <ArgentUndaCova> Woah what the fuck was that??
[6:01:47] <stevenellis386> FINISH HIM
[6:01:47] <%Brassnarwhal> that cast animation was FICKING SICK
[6:01:48] <rosabellamelantha> That move SUCKS when enemies use it
[6:01:49] <RyuuAoi> O! Great!
[6:01:49] <+PatchTheSquid> whats pats stat spread?
[6:01:51] <penitentpendant> It's got some build up, it seems
[6:01:52] <RyuuAoi> Same
[6:01:59] <+Grayhammatter> the fuck was that?
[6:02:06] <%dekkitout> Neat
[6:02:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @cade_calrayn what zone is that
[6:02:11] <Midnight188> no more lightning spear for pat?
[6:02:12] <Sunstalker> 42nfl19 Nah, it's the animation your hand makes for casting
[6:02:13] <rosabellamelantha> @doster504 I know what you're gonna say I beat the game too and that pisses me the hell off lmao
[6:02:14] <RyuuAoi> Fuck yeah
[6:02:18] <Ner234> Nice
[6:02:19] <+Grayhammatter> neat
[6:02:22] <+Ravenian96> is that death smoke?
[6:02:32] <+Grayhammatter> death smoke
[6:02:32] <SubjectX07x> It's death blight smoke.
[6:02:36] <+Ravenian96> from
[6:02:39] <+Grayhammatter> from death lightning
[6:02:40] <GenericTwitchAcc1> short range af
[6:02:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its basilisk death smoke for pvp
[6:02:43] <ArgentUndaCova> Firestorm with instant death smoke mopSweat
[6:02:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> not bad!
[6:02:53] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Firestorm but with curse smoke
[6:03:04] <RyuuAoi> It's aight
[6:03:05] <doster504> @rosabellamelantha so many boss moves that you can just throw my god
[6:03:06] <WorstThingsFirst> Stanky legs
[6:03:07] <+Ravenian96> pretty good for poise dmg
[6:03:10] <+Grayhammatter> not bad
[6:03:10] <%Brassnarwhal> yikes
[6:03:13] <XxMoliciousxX> why do they have 2 feeding tentacles like squids
[6:03:30] <+Ravenian96> what is elden stars lore?
[6:03:36] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> has there been any lore for why trolls have no fucking organs?
[6:03:37] <SubjectX07x> Elden Stars seems best for PVP as a "keep em dodging" move.
[6:03:40] <RyuuAoi> You find a good farm yet?
[6:03:43] <%cade_calrayn> Do you still need smithing stones 5 & 6, Pat?
[6:03:45] <SubjectX07x> It's not particularly great in PVE.
[6:03:47] <%Kevlar_Caviar> elden stars is also a pvp spell iirc, it's good for making people panick and run into other attacks
[6:03:47] <%luftraumm1> dont forget regular lightning
[6:03:51] <kinkade_77> i wish we still had lightning bow
[6:03:59] <42nfl19> why does Pat's resist bars keep poping up everytime he loads in or something?
[6:04:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @hunk_of_dunk i remember someone metioning it but i don't remember what it was, something about the flame of destruction or some shit
[6:04:24] <%Monkeyweed21> it is a shame that pyromancy has lost most of its offensive potential outside of pvp and weak to fire enemies
[6:04:34] <RyuuAoi> @42nfl19 That's happens a lot
[6:04:41] <Sunstalker> 42nfl19 because he has gear on that boosts stats and reloading makes the game reload your stuff on you
[6:04:43] <SubjectX07x> Elden Stars is very much a PVP spell to force panick rolls out of people.
[6:04:45] <%Felhad> Yeah, mine always does it too
[6:04:56] <Midnight188> @42nfl19 his armor has increased resistance
[6:04:57] <penitentpendant> Horse magic!
[6:05:04] <+Ravenian96> if you have talismans that increase stats whenever you load in the resistance they buff shows up
[6:05:12] <42nfl19> lol he hit everything   BUT the main plant on that spell
[6:05:14] <%Brassnarwhal> BEAT CLAW BEST CLAW
[6:05:14] <+Ravenian96> like blood/poison etc
[6:05:28] <RyuuAoi> Okay GAME OVER. Never not on horse!
[6:05:52] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[6:06:08] <kinkade_77> terrible
[6:06:29] <XxMoliciousxX> bugged hitboxes?
[6:06:30] <%Brassnarwhal> are bosses susceptible to the death status?
[6:06:32] <Midnight188> the lightning has curse juice so it's pvp
[6:06:52] <RyuuAoi> We labbin'
[6:06:59] <joshistheman3> that guy ust kicked a hill at you
[6:07:13] <+Ravenian96> pretttttty good
[6:07:15] <%twohitgood> pretty good crit
[6:07:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> Missed an item near him.
[6:07:29] <kinkade_77> why are the mini projectiles on elden stars so weak
[6:07:35] <%Brassnarwhal> sipsipSipsipblind
[6:07:42] <NewWillinium> Ooh. Just got a Halberd whose Special attack boosts your Summons. That's awesome and nowhere near usable for my build
[6:07:47] <+Ravenian96> they scale up to 80 faith
[6:07:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @kinkade_77 so they can be faster and home more
[6:07:52] <+Ravenian96> they can be nutty
[6:07:56] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat you should go invade some fools
[6:08:02] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> because there's like a bajillion of them
[6:08:16] <%X2Eliah> Morning, pat, all. Are ya winning, son?
[6:08:20] <+thugnasty117> At my first hockey game bro had to check how you going lol
[6:08:27] <SubjectX07x> @kinkade_77 Elden Star's best use is PVP, it will scare the crap out of them as a billion projectiles come flying at them and forces them to dodge or get hit over and over.
[6:08:35] <TheQuadrupleS> YOU GOT BLAIDD"S ARMOR
[6:08:43] <%Brassnarwhal> the dragon rot breath is really good for keeping people away from you in pvp
[6:08:48] <TheQuadrupleS> Thats sick
[6:08:48] <%X2Eliah> do the little projectiles do stagger?
[6:08:51] <+Ravenian96> sad thing is you can dodge and still get hit over and over
[6:08:53] <%X2Eliah> if so that could be useful
[6:08:58] <Midnight188> seems like u found a ton of cool pvp spells
[6:09:02] <SubjectX07x> @TheQuadrupleS You get it at the end of Ranni's quest line if you go back to her rise after.
[6:09:18] <%JoshManVGH> What's the benefit of having the fist weapon equipped?
[6:09:35] <+Ravenian96> the big explosion staggers, little ones just tickle
[6:09:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @joshmanvgh which one
[6:09:40] <TheQuadrupleS> Thnx, guess I'm doin Ranni's questline LUL
[6:09:43] <%robotoken> how far into the game?
[6:09:43] <jubejube56> Blood for the blood god
[6:09:43] <KasiCrafter> >safely invade
[6:09:48] <KasiCrafter> Oh you mean pub stomp?
[6:10:08] <%Brassnarwhal> it has sl based matchmaking
[6:10:11] <+Shimano232> pat press L1 when looking at the map, shows PvP and co-op activity.
[6:10:22] <%Brassnarwhal> what is soul level called now
[6:10:22] <+Ravenian96> probably better luck around atlus, mt gelmir
[6:10:32] <SubjectX07x> @TheQuadrupleS Have fun, it's VERY long and holds like 4 optional boss fights you aren't likely to see otherwise.
[6:10:33] <+Shimano232> shows activity
[6:10:33] <+Ravenian96> Those circles mean pvp available
[6:10:33] <%X2Eliah> are those summon pools?
[6:10:53] <%JoshManVGH> @brassnarwhal He had the P... something. The glowy holy word claws equipped. Was wondering if they had a passive buff or something.
[6:10:58] <+Ravenian96> So you don't have to guess where to invade
[6:11:01] <%greasypete00> KILLEM
[6:11:08] <+Shimano232> summon pools + intensity of color means more activity.
[6:11:12] <Ner234> Murder

[6:12:13] <bassoontyphoon> YOU DIDNT WIN
[6:12:17] <SubjectX07x> Back at Liurnia lake.
[6:12:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you'll likely always encounter groups since solo invasions is opt in only

[6:13:35] <slix3431> Nice sword Pat
[6:13:36] <+Ravenian96> i don't think this a holy mountain
[6:13:38] <slix3431> Why it so smoll
[6:13:38] <+reaver93> Is Pat in Bloodborne?
[6:13:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @greasypete00 he got it from doing the invader quest
[6:14:11] <%Brassnarwhal> gank time

[6:15:05] <%Brassnarwhal> if you tell chat where to go you could fight people from chatyiu ruined that hosts boss fight lmao
[6:15:05] <%luftraumm1> you fucked up that attempt for that guy
[6:15:11] <SubjectX07x> I looked away for two seconds.
[6:15:18] <%luftraumm1> nice
[6:15:25] <RyuuAoi> They died in three swings
[6:15:25] <Zourath> Personally, I like invading in Sellia Crystal Tunnel, there's no merika statue near the boss, it's a long-ish dungeon, and the boss itself is a tougher one, so you always get fights.
[6:15:30] <%X2Eliah> yeah it looks like those circles really are showing where the summoning pool effigies are
[6:15:31] <SubjectX07x> Should be in the lake.
[6:15:33] <%cade_calrayn> Liurnia
[6:15:34] <+Shimano232> just left of raya lucaria
[6:15:36] <%luftraumm1> prolly capital
[6:15:37] <+Ravenian96> mt gelmir?
[6:15:38] <SubjectX07x> Kinda by where you fought the glintstone dragon.
[6:15:38] <%greasypete00> south of academy
[6:15:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> out in the lake I think
[6:15:39] <%cade_calrayn> South of the Academy
[6:15:44] <+reaver93> This game just really feels like one massive love letter to their other games
[6:15:47] <%cade_calrayn> Southwest
[6:15:49] <SubjectX07x> Youuuu might have actually misseed it judging by this map lol.
[6:15:54] <%Brassnarwhal> south west of college
[6:15:56] <%greasypete00> south left
[6:15:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> u didn't find it yet :)
[6:16:06] <SubjectX07x> Oh no there it is.
[6:16:16] <%Brassnarwhal> more west less south
[6:16:20] <+Ravenian96> is invadeable
[6:16:21] <+Shimano232> in pvp range
[6:16:31] <SubjectX07x> So those PVP zones aren't actually that small.
[6:16:58] <%Brassnarwhal> invading in caria seems so brutal to figgt against lol
[6:17:01] <SubjectX07x> Mee and a friend went down to that lake and were getting invaded there despite there being no circle, I assume it comes from the Raya Lucaria invasion zones.
[6:17:33] <SubjectX07x> I guess they could lol.
[6:17:41] <%Brassnarwhal> invade near where you know overworld bosses spawn @patstaresat
[6:17:42] <%Bullet25fxbx> I think the first church
[6:17:47] <%X2Eliah> question - for weapons with Holy Dmg that have a skill that makes them holy (like the slash-projectile ashes Pat had way back), is the holy dmg always active or only when its glowing? (and only physical  otherwise)?
[6:17:50] <%Monkeyweed21> I know some people use this place to duel
[6:17:56] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  did you do the invasion at the main gate of the academy?
[6:18:15] <+Ravenian96> it's easier to fuck up other invaders than it is to invade
[6:18:23] <+funya_rinpa> what do you get for pvp in this game
[6:18:24] <HeroToxiko> YOINK
[6:18:25] <xerotwo> WOMP WOMP LUL
[6:18:32] <SubjectX07x> You can absolutely invade down at Temple quarter, did it for hours the last few days with my friend at around level 90, myself at 140 using a password.
[6:18:36] <%Brassnarwhal> alright chat everyone hop in game and invite pvp
[6:18:47] <doster504> @funya_rinpa rune arcs they're like humanities
[6:19:09] <+Ravenian96> did you do maiden quest?
[6:19:13] <%Brassnarwhal> i got vyke to spawn but I didn't touch the pvp quest
[6:19:13] <luciluxlu0> I don't  think he appears from that grace
[6:19:16] <+Nomenanza> well you cant use torrent in general in any invasion yeah
[6:19:19] <SubjectX07x> @Brassnarwhal I would but I'm on PC... apparently I'm one of the few lucky ones it works well for.
[6:19:34] <%Axellogic> did you talk to the ghost already?
[6:19:38] <+Ravenian96> YS
[6:19:43] <+Ravenian96> he in cave
[6:19:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @subjectx07x I'm also on pc otherwise i would do it
[6:19:50] <%Axellogic> thats what summoned vyke for me
[6:19:51] <+Nomenanza> Did you clear that village where mad people are? I can only guess what the trigger might be
[6:19:53] <RyuuAoi> Everybody at the bar
[6:19:55] <%X2Eliah> Damn. That quest is buggy... I got that guy (fingerprint vyke), but the blind grape girl doesnt spawn now...
[6:19:58] <+Ravenian96> magma wyrm grace
[6:20:10] <$thomassolorio> did u beet the game yet
[6:20:17] <+Ravenian96> YEAH LOL
[6:20:27] <+morton531> Did you already beat the game?
[6:20:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah she moves each time she gets a grape do you know which stage she is currently at?
[6:20:41] <+funya_rinpa> tickles
[6:20:46] <%greasypete00> its havel
[6:20:52] <%Monkeyweed21> this dude helped you fight radahn
[6:20:57] <%Brassnarwhal> he isnt even dodging
[6:21:02] <+meatpizza> thats a big boi
[6:21:02] <RyuuAoi> No chance in hell
[6:21:06] <HeroToxiko> Okay yeah he hit hard
[6:21:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 he helped me fight the magma wyrm
[6:21:14] <RyuuAoi> Ne ER mind
[6:21:18] <RyuuAoi> Big guy
[6:21:19] <xerotwo> LUL
[6:21:21] <%X2Eliah> @Brassnarwhal she should be at the 4th stage, the church
[6:21:24] <+grapplingwithdepression> god i cant wait to get lightning spear
[6:21:25] <akitanito> did he even heal
[6:21:26] <xerotwo> B E E G
[6:21:28] <+funya_rinpa> wow, he just took those
[6:21:28] <+Nomenanza> oh shit you got Fortisax's spells
[6:21:29] <+Ravenian96> congrats on beating havel
[6:21:36] <RyuuAoi> He put up a fight.
[6:21:40] <xerotwo> he didn't even heal lol
[6:21:43] <%Dakuu75> wait so, the red npc summon signs are actually on the map?
[6:21:43] <%X2Eliah> @Brassnarwhal ive already given the three shibrururu grapes at the first 3 spots
[6:21:47] <+morton531> That was an NPC right?
[6:21:56] <bassoontyphoon> He gotta dump truck and ain’t afraid to use it
[6:21:59] <SubjectX07x> Hmmm, wonder if Tragoth is the havel of elden ring..?
[6:22:01] <jubejube56> Those are a lot of weird to land incantations
[6:22:04] <%dekkitout> Yes.
[6:22:09] <+Nomenanza> G I A N T
[6:22:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah bellum church if you havent given her the fingerprint grape, once you give it to her she goes pretty far ahead of you
[6:22:11] <+tactician0> man I've been playing ER for 63 hours and I'm still not done
[6:22:12] <VaguelyHeroic> This is the way.
[6:22:13] <RyuuAoi> Yes
[6:22:15] <NewWillinium> That Hat *is* Glorious. And the Armor is one of the toughest and dumbest looking things I've ever seen
[6:22:21] <%BubbaRands> B I G
[6:22:28] <%X2Eliah> @Brassnarwhal yeah, like I said, she isnt spawning there.
[6:22:35] <$thomassolorio> great sword pat
[6:22:39] <SubjectX07x> @tactician0 I finished it at 91 hours and I didn't even do everything..
[6:22:42] <%JoshManVGH> It's a Great Sword
[6:22:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah did you do the bloody finger quest?
[6:22:51] <+livi242> which bosses did Pat kill today?
[6:22:51] <+Ravenian96> yeah it's pretty worthless grace
[6:22:55] <%luftraumm1> gotta be a grace at the top
[6:22:58] <$thomassolorio> waka waka
[6:22:59] <%Broand> So get this right? frost does a big damage when it fills up, and so does bleed
[6:23:06] <%X2Eliah> @Brassnarwhal er... no?
[6:23:08] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winnin son?
[6:23:14] <SubjectX07x> @Broand Yep, and you can combine them.
[6:23:18] <%Broand> So my frost spiked cestus is a little silly
[6:23:23] <RyuuAoi> Jokes
[6:23:29] <+tactician0> @subjectx07x I'm doing everything I can find to do
[6:23:31] <SubjectX07x> Very much so.
[6:23:36] <%Brassnarwhal> you should grab the ruler set before bed too pat it's right by the grace from the lift into altus plateau and you can grab it without figgting anyone
[6:23:41] <+grapplingwithdepression> ooh what does frost scale with?
[6:23:49] <+Ravenian96> frost and bleed buildup double popping literally one shots people
[6:23:52] <+Ravenian96> frost scales with int
[6:24:04] <%X2Eliah> yeah frost is int
[6:24:07] <%X2Eliah> unfortunately
[6:24:11] <+grapplingwithdepression> dang im playing dex/faith
[6:24:20] <RyuuAoi> This ain't even fair ha
[6:24:21] <+grapplingwithdepression> just because i wanted to use a flail at the start lol
[6:24:21] <%luftraumm1> thats the coolest
[6:24:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah idk then, that quest seems to be really picky, it has to do with a specific ending so if you locked into a different ending it might just fail the quest and despawn her
[6:24:24] <+Ravenian96> perfect for moonveil double katana gang
[6:24:26] <SubjectX07x> Bleed scales with arcane yes?
[6:24:37] <%kujofire990> fuck that guy in particular
[6:24:39] <+Ravenian96> bleed scales with arc yes
[6:24:43] <nip_nips> fort, evening...?
[6:24:50] <%epide> pats a sith now
[6:24:51] <jubejube56> Can you jump off torrent and do the lightning?
[6:24:51] <+grapplingwithdepression> oh does it? thats cool i gotta add some more arcane to use some of the incantations anyways
[6:25:03] <RyuuAoi> That's tight with the cape
[6:25:07] <+Ravenian96> i think it increase bleed buildup not dmg
[6:25:22] <RyuuAoi> Batman over here
[6:25:25] <+tactician0> pat just wiped tomato town
[6:25:26] <+Ravenian96> yeah yeah
[6:25:30] <+grapplingwithdepression> thats still pretty useful
[6:25:40] <%Dakuu75> What if I use the dragon casting thing. that red mark
[6:25:41] <%luftraumm1> nice stgger on that
[6:25:43] <%JoshManVGH> What does "build up" mean in this context?
[6:26:04] <@QueequegTheater> @JoshManVGH number of hits to proc
[6:26:09] <+Ravenian96> weapon says bleed buildup (50) on item description, it increases that
[6:26:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @joshmanvgh the status effect meter that fills up to proc the status effect
[6:26:13] <%X2Eliah> how muhc points are added to the buildup bar per each hit
[6:26:14] <+ZackSkyy> @JoshManVGH theres an invisible meter it fills up on the target and when its full it inflicts a stastus effect
[6:26:16] <%JoshManVGH> Oh shit
[6:26:25] <RyuuAoi> Tank
[6:26:27] <oda_flobunaga> There are arcane damage scaling weapons though
[6:26:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> Horse has item.
[6:26:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @oda_flobunaga that's different, and people have said arcane scaled weapons are bugged rn too
[6:26:59] <+Ravenian96> the arcane doesn't increase dmg, just the amount towards bleed meter
[6:27:00] <xerotwo> wow
[6:27:21] <oda_flobunaga> @Brassnarwhal tell that to Morgott's Sword.
[6:27:27] <oda_flobunaga> its fine
[6:27:28] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt would the Dragon Communion Seal, casting thing, let you use arcane more?
[6:27:41] <%luftraumm1> you should deth blight someone
[6:27:47] <oda_flobunaga> There have always been weapons with no scaling.  Dragon weapons in DS1
[6:27:49] <+TAFK> can you summon from the horse?
[6:27:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @oda_flobunaga I haven't tested any of ut I'm just repeating what i heard, i havent touched any arcane shit
[6:27:58] <+tactician0> roll out of this asshat
[6:28:04] <+grapplingwithdepression> @TAFK with the ashes? yeah
[6:28:28] <stevenellis386> woah thats sick
