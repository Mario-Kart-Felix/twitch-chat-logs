[0:04:06] <%linSP> BALLERS GATE
[0:04:07] <@commanderclaw> The nice thing about BG3's twitch integration is that it's an opt in on a per dialogue choice basis
[0:04:10] <%tizz86> @sofarfetched which sucks bc im 99% mobile/ps4
[0:04:10] <penitentpentwitch> The "Baldur's Gate 3 Companion" thing? It only shows up on PC when I hover over the window.

[0:04:44] <+maynardftw> @ThatGuyThere03 Theoretically, yes. We can only guess, the game isn't out yet.
[0:04:45] <BoneofMalkav> @ThatGuyThere03 It's made by the same developers as D:OS 1 and 2

[0:05:35] <+oda_flobunaga> Pat is Duc D'Orb
[0:05:39] <@SoFarFetched> "But for those on Twitch who are looking to involve the viewers in making the big decisions that change the game, viewers in chat can vote on dialogue choices as they occur in real time. In addition, they can interact with the overlay to check out character stats, inventory, and other critical information without pestering the streamer to spend time constantly checking bags and character sheets."

[0:15:31] <%arcaderabbit48> arcaderabbit48 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Never got why OG Baldur's Gate did the weird Real Time thing. Its not how any Edition of D&D has been played, even during the hot mess that was 1st Edition. Its a shame too, because I might actually be able to play 1&2 if they were turn based.
[0:15:32] <%RyanGelatin> is bal;durs gate as good as planescape or is planescape just the best isometic rpg

[0:29:17] <%donkymagooterson> *blink*
[0:29:18] <%heartlesshealer> <3 <3 <3
[0:29:18] <WakeUpThrow> This dog is going to get so fucking big man
[0:29:19] <alextrebeken> what will pat do when baby gets too fat to pick up
[0:29:19] <%Parapattern> Kiss hime!
[0:29:22] <+MoonObscure> AWWWW
[0:29:29] <+Bones8677> @PatStaresAt Do you keep the leash on him so that he gets used to it?
[0:29:30] <%mikessdd> I played Baulder's gate wayyyy later. My first introduction was Dark Alliance on the PS2
[0:29:30] <%asgard147> limesAw psaDogchamp
[0:29:32] <%IminyourBase> he will never get too fat
[0:29:32] <%maskofmichael> psaDogchamp Huge Baby Forever
[0:29:33] <+Pyroclase> then the baby will pick up Pat
[0:29:34] <%crimsonharvest> then pat will lay on baby
[0:29:38] <%BoxNavy> hes gonna fall right back to sleep
[0:29:38] <KiryujiKazamoto> Geif will pick Pat up
[0:29:38] <+gnoame> That's when pat teaches baby to pick him up instead
[0:29:43] <+inktoxicant> he's a little loaf
[0:29:46] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Just lift until you can pick him up again
[0:29:49] <tanarath> coax him with treats
[0:29:50] <%donkymagooterson> Pat will ride him around the house like a gnome on a wardog
[0:29:51] <%Parapattern> Look at him
[0:29:51] <%heartlesshealer> no mater how heavy dog get, you can always hold dog
[0:29:57] <%heartlesshealer> just not pick them up
[0:29:57] <%crimsonharvest> lol what a shitshow that must have been
[0:29:58] <+DonnieAdonis> you mean next week
[0:30:04] <%dasmause> mage? wizard, sorcerer or warlock?
[0:30:07] <$crusader_raul> my cat sits alone all the time like a troll :{
[0:30:08] <%crimsonharvest> magic user lolololol
[0:30:09] <%BoxNavy> dark bark dark bark
[0:30:15] <%deathscythe122887> @PatStaresAt I love how tired the Chunk Baby is
[0:30:19] <+Rukabuk> I joined and was wondering why Pat had stuff blocking the screen cause I wanted to see puppy. I only just now realized it was an extension.
[0:30:21] <%BoxNavy> no way twitch will ban that game
[0:30:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> cheer565 Everyone always talks about Drizzt the drow, but forget about that shit! We all know the true hypest character in D&D fiction is Kaz the minotaur!
[0:30:23] <%asgard147> Bark? psaDogchamp
[0:30:27] <+Promessa_EX> it will get a twitch "artisic" exception so screw it
[0:30:28] <%Calek> if the game isn't about nudity it's fine
[0:30:29] <+Dorf1> @dasmause it was 2e so wizard
[0:30:29] <%twistedj3ster> When Big Skelmaton?
[0:30:29] <%OhioNitsud> oh dope, this is out
[0:30:30] <$joylent_blue> if its in the game by default, then twitch doesn't care
[0:30:36] <+leondatwani> I just spent 3 hours playing this and the game is awesome so far
[0:30:38] <Ethel9727> Now I am imagining Pat, Paige, and Woolie playing D&D together with Plague as DM
[0:30:39] <$joylent_blue> its if the nudity is modded in that twitch doesn't like
[0:30:41] <+Pyroclase> I'd be shocked if Pat doesn't play Cyberpunk
[0:30:42] <%ExpressNode> They allowed the Last of Us part 2 nudity so it should be allowed
[0:30:43] <Djinnazz> no it doesn't
[0:30:45] <%heartlesshealer> oh wow
[0:30:46] <%BoxNavy> cringe is eternal moon2W
[0:30:47] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> who
[0:30:47] <+Pyroclase> Oh yeah you're ancient buddy
[0:30:47] <DianaTheAscian> who?
[0:30:48] <%afronooch> yep
[0:30:48] <+wmeldrum> cringe is forever
[0:30:49] <$crusader_raul> oh no
[0:30:50] <Xelhesia> yes it does
[0:30:51] <alphonseisbest> YES
[0:30:53] <%tizz86> my favorites were rogue and psyonisit in 3.5
[0:30:53] <jorniev> OOOH
[0:30:54] <Drusain> damn i'm old
[0:30:55] <%Barelyaudible> You mean that guy I killed for his scimitars?
[0:30:56] <jorniev> OOOOOOH
[0:30:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Who?
[0:30:57] <penitentpentwitch> Cringe fades with time, until some makes a compilation of if
[0:30:57] <tubit> well, fuck
[0:30:58] <%Jekado> What about Elminster?!?
[0:30:59] <Goodvibes99508> I'm 25 tho?
[0:30:59] <jorniev> OOOOOOH GOOOD
[0:31:00] <$crusader_raul> mmm gosh
[0:31:00] <+SwipperSwap> it does not it creeps back in the middle of the night and whacks you over the head
[0:31:00] <sendart> fuck
[0:31:01] <%Parapattern> Cringe only gets harsher with time
[0:31:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> You can probably turn on censorship, and hopefully theres a streamer/youtube friendly mode
[0:31:01] <lesbosmer> o o f
[0:31:02] <snaggletusks> That or you fraternize with old DND people
[0:31:02] <LordOfThePoultry> PepeHands
[0:31:03] <DSD24> Drrzt?
[0:31:03] <tanarath> drizzt, god
[0:31:04] <%aslfrasle> What about knowing Tanis Half-Elf and Raistlin Majeure?
[0:31:04] <KnightAsteran> who the fuck is Drizd?
[0:31:04] <%Wallabri> oh no
[0:31:05] <+cgreene64> Drizzt was ina game called "Demon Stone" in the mid 2000s
[0:31:05] <%RyanGelatin> SCRICKEN
[0:31:06] <jorniev> IM SO FUCKING OLD
[0:31:07] <+ishouldfeelbad> but all the books
[0:31:08] <+immortanjoestar> fellas is it gay to be old?
[0:31:08] <%vaporousTippler> Then I'm probably ancient because I named a rogue David Tasslehoff.
[0:31:10] <%Calek> oh no people are asking Who and I feel sad
[0:31:12] <ShineTheDiamond> I've already got arthritis, so......
[0:31:13] <%mikessdd> But he's THE dark elf
[0:31:16] <%asgard147> wait but hold on tho... limesFeels
[0:31:19] <Frodiddly> Knowing who Drizzt is makes you a huge D&D boomer, knowing Greyhawk makes you a D&D corpse
[0:31:19] <+Byronic_dreamer> I'm 24 and I know who Drizzt is
[0:31:20] <digaogrunge> Can you say Menzoberranzan yho?
[0:31:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ravel Puzzlewell
[0:31:21] <mattynezz> Cringe grows stronger with time
[0:31:21] <%Bailey__gaming> KEYS MISSING
[0:31:22] <%afronooch> fellas is it gay to remember Drizz't
[0:31:23] <$zyberion626> AGAIN?
[0:31:23] <DianaTheAscian> for real though who that?
[0:31:25] <%calamari__> drizzt from the beloved ps2 classic baldur's gate: dark alliance, sure
[0:31:32] <%RyanGelatin> i cant wait for that puppy to get fucking HUGE
[0:31:34] <%shurtal> I didn't LOSE THEM, i just don't know EXACTLY where they are
[0:31:35] <%Parapattern> Everyone should be asking "Where's Drizzt?"
[0:31:37] <%heartlesshealer> But I still saw old Drizz't comics in the comic/card shop up until last November!
[0:31:38] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt do you still have the shame keys in the lock box?

[0:32:27] <%Jeemukun> thaks Lolth
[0:32:27] <$zyberion626> drow are an entire race of evil
[0:32:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> They are The Evil
[0:32:34] <%vaporousTippler> Apparently they're changing upcoming rules so no race is "evil" anymore.
[0:32:35] <%mikessdd> I was given a shitty Nickname in 7th grade because I was carrying around the Drizzt anthology books. My nickname was Dark Elf and it sucked
[0:32:35] <+Byronic_dreamer> The Drow can go
[0:32:36] <sendart> kill all elves
[0:32:40] <wibbwobbler> genocide 4 good
[0:32:44] <%heartlesshealer> probably
[0:32:44] <%MonsterEnvy> They are not a Race of Evil
[0:32:46] <%Kyoshikei> NOT ALL DROW ARE EVIL
[0:32:47] <%Grayhammatter> i bet
[0:32:48] <+MeatBomb> Drow are basically Ferengi.
[0:32:48] <%MonsterEnvy> They are a culture of evil
[0:32:49] <%calamari__> @Goodvibes99508 I almost mixed it up with champions of norath tbh
[0:32:50] <%tizz86> @yakumoyomi even with the sharp teeth

[0:33:06] <+gnoame> You can steal him away with some pepperoni
[0:33:07] <$joylent_blue> sack of potatoes
[0:33:08] <ChungusQuest> People all jerking off Drizzt, nobody remembers Artemis Entreri was the true edgelord.
[0:33:11] <%DrTomT18> he didnt want to kill the Drow because they were evil. he wanted to kill them because he hatred Drizzt
[0:33:11] <Drusain> but that's a paige trait

[0:37:15] <Krakenoid> A level 1 character will instantly die to a mindflayer looking at them. literally!
[0:37:15] <+FatherGreyBeard> They are like CR 7 in 5e I think
[0:37:16] <%SpcOpsBear> CR 7 in 5E
[0:37:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> that is still the case
[0:37:16] <MrDemsus> Can you play as a tentacle boi in this?
[0:37:16] <ChungusQuest> negative survival percentage

[0:37:17] <%asgard147> yep
[0:37:17] <+leondatwani> true

[0:37:19] <+CarrowayFashonti> That is also true in 5e
[0:37:19] <%KrimsonKyle> and then eat it
[0:37:19] <%Calek> thought they were CR 11
[0:37:21] <%Rumbutt> That is still true 100%
[0:37:21] <$zyberion626> mindflayers are used to mess with high level parties
[0:37:22] <%BoxNavy> my brain is too big for that
[0:37:24] <+kekkerscrew> MindFLayers are Timetravelers from the Distant future
[0:37:25] <LordOfThePoultry> mindflayers fuck
[0:37:25] <+captain_history> super true
[0:37:27] <thesugardaddy111> 100% true
[0:37:29] <+Direfirerat5> you still have the blur boxes up from the Impact stream
[0:37:29] <+uselessbathhouse> action enconomy BABY
[0:37:30] <%YakumoYomi> Illithids are a big problem for high level characters, let alone low level ones
[0:37:31] <%RyanGelatin> blow ur brain like it blows big fartsa
[0:37:34] <%Nny7229> a party of 4 lvl 11-13 are best
[0:37:35] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt a level 14 character can just get fucked by a mind flayer.
[0:37:37] <%maskofmichael> But what about a level 1 mind flayer
[0:37:38] <%AncelDeLambert> jack and all
[0:37:38] <%Wallabri> at level 1 you'd Big Die
[0:37:39] <%MegboyManuel> Baldur's Gate is also Avernus stuff
[0:37:41] <Sunstalker> dialouge voting
[0:37:42] <DSD24> So many options
[0:37:42] <%MegboyManuel> big Demon stuff
[0:37:43] <Grandma_Amari> Hell even mid-tier characters can have a problem against mindflayers
[0:37:46] <lesbosmer> a single mindflayer could instakill every level 1 character in 60 feet with one move
[0:37:47] <%BoxNavy> it lets us vote i guess
[0:37:47] <LoneFonte> extension secret?
[0:37:47] <Manwad> windows G ENABLE
[0:37:48] <tanarath> Pat, without proper equipment, a level 15 or even 20 character could be fucked.
[0:37:49] <Xelgus> extension secret?
[0:37:49] <Guyshane> They'll tear your soul apart
[0:37:50] <%Mythicalbrit> Mythicalbrit subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! if mindflayers eat your mind does that mean the gross feet people are actually safe?
[0:37:50] <+Dorf1> if youre D&D knowledge from 20 years ago you wouldnt factor character level into what your character can fight
[0:37:51] <HarmlessCrow> Mindflayers are honestly terrifying to fight and the Underdark can get FUCKED
[0:37:51] <%JumboCrunchies> Lets us vote on dialogue
[0:37:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think we can vote on things
[0:37:52] <%huskarl_zap> it lets us vote on dialogue
[0:37:53] <Roach3s> what it do PogChamp
[0:37:54] <AmericanaRed> MINDFLAYER HAREM Kreygasm
[0:37:54] <@SoFarFetched> "But for those on Twitch who are looking to involve the viewers in making the big decisions that change the game, viewers in chat can vote on dialogue choices as they occur in real time. In addition, they can interact with the overlay to check out character stats, inventory, and other critical information without pestering the streamer to spend time constantly checking bags and character sheets"
[0:37:55] <%r0chelimit> A team of level 1s have 0 chance
[0:37:55] <+pajamarammaslamma> Looking for the drizzd button
[0:37:57] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt apparently we can see your character sheet, and suggest dialogue options
[0:37:59] <%donkymagooterson> always hit buttons when you don't know what they do
[0:37:59] <Krakenoid> mindflayers are often not alone as well
[0:38:00] <%AzureGale> Time 2 ruin Pat's characters
[0:38:01] <+pectusumbra> okay, CR7 in 5e
[0:38:02] <Grandma_Amari> We pick dialogue for you Kappsa
[0:38:03] <%MonsterEnvy> I am betting the mystery button will be game stuff
[0:38:04] <tuskntemper> I think it lets us vote on dialogue choices
[0:38:06] <%PettyFunk> A friend of mine made us fight a mindflayer in our third D&D session. That was our last D&D session
[0:38:07] <%Grayhammatter> oh no

[0:38:22] <lesbosmer> fuck yes
[0:38:23] <%SpcOpsBear> "Fake fullscreen"
[0:38:23] <+TheSaintJohn> its not a bug, its the mindflayers
[0:38:24] <%BoxNavy> HUGE GRAPHICS
[0:38:24] <Them00n> I don't understand the reasoning behind doing the EA thing.
[0:38:25] <Grandma_Amari> Uh oh Kappa
[0:38:25] <oldsickback> This out?
[0:38:25] <%heartlesshealer> smallest text
[0:38:26] <HarmlessCrow> The thing is, if Mindflayers are the "Big Bads", what's supposed to be the challenge when you get to lvl 20?
[0:38:26] <$zyberion626> @alphonseisbest lvl 20 for most PC's
[0:38:26] <%huskarl_zap> fake fullscreen LUL
[0:38:27] <%Grayhammatter> BIGGEST
[0:38:27] <@SoFarFetched> Chat can vote on Dialogue choices AND you can look at his stats with the extension, without having to ask him for it.
[0:38:28] <+Phunyun> triple buffering why tho
[0:38:29] <+CarrowayFashonti> Level 20 is usually max level in DnD

[0:39:00] <%Bailey__gaming> text is super small
[0:39:01] <DaHaLoJeDi> Dude Mind Flayers can completely fuck even level 20 parties in tabletop DnD simply because they can drop a potential AoE stunlock on everyone at once
[0:39:04] <%ExpressNode> I do too
[0:39:10] <%MonsterEnvy> Which Class are you going to play
[0:39:12] <%kekkerscrew> Fun Fact Mind Flayers are time travelers from the end of time where they ruled the entire universe.

[0:39:15] <%saadi90> Me too
[0:39:16] <ScreamLord> Input lag in a turn based game isn't a big deal

[1:09:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> Warlocks are Charisma based casters, @PatStaresAt which is perfect for tieflings
[1:09:20] <lesbosmer> warlocks are charisma
[1:09:20] <+moustascheman> check the stars
[1:09:21] <+JonathLP> The stars on character portrait

[1:09:31] <cherrycottontail> That's not 5e
[1:09:33] <%SpcOpsBear> No, it's Vancian spellcasting but you're LOCKED to one spell level that improves with class level and have a limited number of casts that recharge per fight
[1:09:34] <joker2196> warlock
[1:09:34] <%TrafficCohen> Ranger........ sucks in 5e
[1:09:34] <%crimsonharvest> Ranger is a Fighter subclass

[1:09:39] <Gallhint> woahh cool we get to vote on shit
[1:09:39] <%blastazoid26> For charlattan
[1:09:39] <+mczarklesby> Warlocks: focus on charisma, pump eldritch blast to the heavens. It's like a constantly hitting medium power that can get added to with buffs as you go.
[1:09:39] <+ohyouthot> yeah you still need a short rest

[1:09:49] <Drusain> Wait warlocks are just sorcerers with a different name here
[1:09:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> there's a reason why tiefling warlocks are meta builds.

[1:11:24] <VioletHeart> It's been in 5e since it came out.
[1:11:24] <%ChestMimik> Pat you want Hex
[1:11:26] <dinnydanny777> Cursed by good
[1:11:26] <%YakumoYomi> Does Eldritch Blast have Blast Shapes in this game?

[1:11:30] <+shabop> yes
[1:11:30] <%KrimsonKyle> there's so little in comparison to the actual table top game... this makes me sad.
[1:11:30] <ZComiX> yeah basically all higher beings cannot control you
[1:11:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> They combined 2 spells
[1:11:31] <%trueherobappo> how much is this game?
[1:11:31] <%RD_nx> Did Pat get a review code for this game or did he buy it?
[1:11:32] <KilljoyHexx> I think I might not be able to watch this my dnd brain is going crazy
[1:11:33] <digaogrunge> It used to be 2 spells
[1:11:34] <Equirah> HEX IS CLUTCH
[1:11:34] <OvaltineDream> Old ones are neutral I guess
[1:11:35] <evilthecat17> They put all the evil/good and chaos/order spells together in 5e
[1:11:36] <tubit> Protection from shitlords

[1:11:38] <%TheLemuroid> yeah its merged
[1:11:39] <%trueherobappo> At work so I can't check.
[1:11:39] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt you're going to want Hex
[1:11:40] <%gespenst25> you usually have to choose one or the other when you cast it
[1:11:43] <tanarath> @patstaresat Yeah? probably for 5e
[1:11:43] <LoneFonte> @boomboxvillain it is a DnD property so they are using 5e almost exactly
[1:11:43] <%Jeemukun> yeah 5E merged a bunch of spells together
[1:11:45] <lesbosmer> hex is good as hell
[1:11:45] <%SpcOpsBear> A lot of spells in 5E are just multiple spells that scale with spell level
[1:11:45] <%Garthunox> Pat read hellish rebuke!
[1:11:46] <TheHeroAppears> protection from beyond good and evil
[1:11:46] <KiryujiKazamoto> magic missile
[1:11:47] <%Calek> Witch Bolt is booty
[1:11:49] <%AncelDeLambert> it used to be two SEPERATE spells, people
[1:11:50] <Grandma_Amari> That's been around, it protects against basically everything considered good or evil by nature
[1:11:50] <+butterick> neuterboy
[1:11:50] <jtrost> witch bolt bad
[1:11:51] <%TrafficCohen> @RD_nx Early access if you buy it now
[1:11:52] <%SpcOpsBear> But as one hell
[1:11:52] <olaksi> I cast Perhaps the Truth Is In the Middle
[1:11:54] <+MooseIsGoose> You choose a creature type with it
[1:11:54] <%snow_bush> Man, I miss 3.5
[1:11:55] <%SpcOpsBear> Er, spell
[1:11:59] <%Parapattern> Protect me from the Good Rays
[1:12:00] <jestrfestr> LUL
[1:12:01] <%ChestMimik> It's free damage
[1:12:02] <%Grayhammatter> wow
[1:12:04] <digaogrunge> HEX IS NEEDED
[1:12:04] <%TheWinged7> Which bolt hits every round for 1 cast
[1:12:05] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> YEAH HEX IS FUCKING GREAT
[1:12:07] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking stacking damage, let's go
[1:12:08] <%Totally_Not_Toby> that's like necessary
[1:12:08] <%Barelyaudible> it's not going to scale well, though
[1:12:11] <%heartlesshealer> just shove weakness onto a creature
[1:12:13] <%Profmcstevie> Easy sell to me
[1:12:16] <%Grayhammatter> free damage, lovely
[1:12:16] <jorniev> HEX IS MUST
[1:12:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> Tasha's also good.
[1:12:17] <mechengineers> wait is is crown of madness level 1 or 2 spells?
[1:12:19] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt If I know almost nothing about DnD but love RPGs, would this be a game to get into?
[1:12:20] <JaseAdrift> its not that good
[1:12:20] <%TrafficCohen> Whispers: "It's free real estate"
[1:12:21] <%SpcOpsBear> they both require concentration though
[1:12:21] <%ryome> ELDRICTH BLAST
[1:12:22] <%Calek> are there invocations in this, do you get to add CHA to your EB?
[1:12:22] <OvaltineDream> Found our claass looks like
[1:12:23] <+pectusumbra> Now, the downside to Warlocks is you have VERY few spell slots, but you get extra abilities
[1:12:24] <KiryujiKazamoto> but fiend
[1:12:24] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt Blade Ward is garbo pick something else.
[1:12:25] <lord_sykos> Hes is also a BONUS action
[1:12:25] <%Profmcstevie> Just fuck my life up Hex
[1:12:27] <Bluewolf544> It really isn't that good, needs concentration
[1:12:27] <%Reaviar> keep eldritch blast
[1:12:28] <%SpcOpsBear> So you can only have one active at a time
[1:12:30] <+XIR0> Watch Pat make the prototypical Warlock, Which isn't a bad thing actually
[1:12:32] <+Cavumentum> I like Hex Eldritch blast STAYS
[1:12:33] <+Havictos> What about Eldritch Blast can he get that?
[1:12:34] <+KR_Black> ARMOR OF AGATHIS
[1:12:36] <jtrost> crown of madness is also bad
[1:12:36] <AdmiralButtloaf> if you get hit you have to roll
[1:12:39] <+Basilias_Maximus> They're both concentration.
[1:12:40] <evilthecat17> Have to keep casting it
[1:12:40] <%aslfrasle> OH GOD...
[1:12:40] <%Barelyaudible> means you can only cast 1
[1:12:41] <+FatherGreyBeard> You can only have one Concentration spell active
[1:12:41] <+JonathLP> Can only have 1 concentration spell at once
[1:12:42] <+Jonesman64> always Eldritch blast
[1:12:42] <%ChestMimik> Concentration means you can only cast one concentration at a time
[1:12:42] <jestrfestr> mean when you're hit you have to save on WIS to keep the spell
[1:12:43] <%nikoloas_> concentration is a skill
[1:12:43] <kayamek> Just a Warlock doing stand up then
[1:12:43] <%gespenst25> you have to channel the spell
[1:12:44] <%Barelyaudible> at a time
[1:12:45] <%BigCoffee> a FEAT
[1:12:45] <ZComiX> you can have one spell active, and when hit it has a chance to break
[1:12:46] <DaHaLoJeDi> New 5e Mechanic, you can only concentrate on one spell at a time
[1:12:47] <+takutoots> if you get hit you have to roll to hold it
[1:12:47] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt You can only have 1 Concentration spell active at once
[1:12:47] <%MonsterEnvy> You can only have one concentration spell active at a time
[1:12:48] <tubit> Consentration is like a channeled spell?
[1:12:48] <Zebroneath> Only one concentration spell can be active at a time
[1:12:48] <%JumboCrunchies> @Barelyaudible If its like 5e, it'll get stronger as he levels by using it in higher level slots
[1:12:48] <%radda343> if you get hit you have a chance of dropping the spell
[1:12:49] <+AgniBrandt> You can only use one concentration spell at a time
[1:12:50] <Guyshane> Can only concentrate on one persistent spell at a time
[1:12:50] <@commanderclaw> You can only have 1 concentration spell at a time and if you get hit you have a chance to lose it
[1:12:51] <Mr_Rakjo> Eldritch BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[1:12:51] <%Rumbutt> Only one Concentration spell at a time too
[1:12:51] <%MisterCrimson> @PatStaresAt it means the effects end if you take a hit
[1:12:52] <%Wallabri> You can only cast and hold one at a time
[1:12:52] <Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Everytime you get hit you gave to roll to keep the spell up
[1:12:53] <tonfirean> Concentration is basically a slot; you can only concentrate one one thing at a time, and it gets broken if you get hit.
[1:12:55] <+RyuMojo> Eldritch Blast best warlock cantrip
[1:12:55] <+pectusumbra> means you have to focus to keep one of them "on"
[1:12:56] <%seraphimjordan> roll to maintain spell
[1:12:57] <%a_mad_dragon> 1 concentration spell at a time
[1:12:59] <TuxedoNash> You can only have ONE Concentration spell active, and you might LOSE Concentration after taking damage
[1:12:59] <tanarath> @patstaresat concentration is channeling, it can be interrupted
[1:12:59] <%Nny7229> means you have to roll of you get hit and you can only concentrate on one spell
[1:12:59] <$TheSmerdis> Only one concentration spell at a time
[1:12:59] <twistedhands> concentration means if you get hit while casting the spell you have to make a roll to cast
[1:13:00] <jorniev> only one concetration spell at a time
[1:13:00] <digaogrunge> YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE CONCENTRATION SPELL UP AT A TIME
[1:13:00] <%Garthunox> you can only have 1 concentration at a time!!!
[1:13:02] <+mczarklesby> Ellldritch blaaaaaast :D
[1:13:03] <dukenux> :)
[1:13:05] <+Bones8677> You have to keep it up, if you get hit, theres a chance you lose it
[1:13:05] <dinnydanny777> Ohhh monster friends
[1:13:07] <%Mr_Improbable> @PatStaresAt Concentration means that you maintain the spell. If you take damage, you have to make a CON save or the spell drops.
[1:13:09] <mikevens7> you cant have 2 concentration spells active ate the same time
[1:13:10] <%heartlesshealer> what's your red one?
[1:13:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only one concentration spell at a time. NO GIANT BUFF STACKS
[1:13:13] <sweenicus> true strike also boiled ass
[1:13:13] <%MonsterEnvy> Minor Illusion is the one I like best
[1:13:18] <+shabop> true strike bad
[1:13:19] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[1:13:20] <%ChestMimik> DN'T TAKE TRUE STRIKE
[1:13:21] <jtrost> @patstaresat you cannot use 2 concentration spells at once. if you are hit you need to roll to maintain concentration
[1:13:21] <Bluewolf544> @patstaresat only one active at a time and gotta make save on hit
[1:13:21] <%eldercat> If you find eldrich blast use it.
[1:13:21] <VioletHeart> Friends and Minor Illusion are both good in the tabletop. Keep Eldritch Blast for sure.
[1:13:23] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> Friends/ Minor Illsion
[1:13:25] <+Immortalsblade> True Strike is the literal worst
[1:13:25] <+XIR0> true strike is actually the worst spell in the game
[1:13:26] <+pectusumbra> Minor illusion or friends probably for utility? Since you already get mage hand
[1:13:26] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt your picking all concentration spells, which means you can only have 1 of those up at once
[1:13:28] <+FatherGreyBeard> Only one concentration spell at a time, and if you take damage you make a Constitution save or lose the spell.
[1:13:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> Minor Illusion for sho
[1:13:30] <Jormundly> Hi James!
[1:13:31] <%SpcOpsBear> TRUE STRIKE HAS ALWAYS SUCKED
[1:13:32] <%ClericOfSparda> psa1guy
[1:13:35] <lesbosmer> i thought eldritch blast would be purple
[1:13:36] <%Nny7229> eldritch blast is the strongest dmg CA trip in the game
[1:13:38] <Macfine> Eldritch blast is the best attacking cantrip, pick something with utility like minor illusion
[1:13:39] <%ChestMimik> True Strike is MATHEMATICALLY WORSE than just attacking twice
[1:13:42] <Ipsenscastle> what is even the point of true strike
[1:13:44] <%SpcOpsBear> Yes that's good!
[1:13:45] <tubit> Sure thing boss
[1:13:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah
[1:13:45] <Them00n> Yes
[1:13:46] <@commanderclaw> Looks good to me
[1:13:46] <jestrfestr> rebuke is good too
[1:13:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> I wonder if you can make boxes to hide in with illusion in this game?
[1:13:47] <HarmlessCrow> YEP
[1:13:49] <%Totally_Not_Toby> looks like a warlock to me!
[1:13:49] <%Chimeraelite> ye

[1:13:50] <%DedlokPM> Oh god. All this time I thought the extension UI was part of the game's ui and I was like "Why is pat creating a character while keeping that Twitch Stream Intergration thing on screen" rooBlank
[1:13:51] <R0DA> o no i have to buy this game now
[1:13:51] <%Spydurman> yes
[1:13:51] <%heartlesshealer> I saw Wisdom on whispers?
[1:13:51] <+akaoridux> :)
[1:13:52] <OvaltineDream> cranky5Hype
[1:13:52] <madogod> NO! make a dwarf
[1:13:52] <+RyuMojo> Yes
[1:13:53] <Captain_Doomsday> I'm a dumbass don't ask me
[1:13:54] <%Nny7229> solid choices
[1:13:54] <+KR_Black> Yup
[1:13:55] <Ids560> seems fine
[1:13:55] <+zinris> pregud
[1:13:55] <%SWFanatic> I am happy with Mr. Bork
[1:13:55] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> YE
[1:13:56] <jorniev> true strike is THE WORST
[1:13:56] <%Grayhammatter> sure, yeah
[1:13:56] <$raziel391> yup
[1:13:56] <%asgard147> it's okay
[1:13:56] <Xelhesia> YEA THATS COOL
[1:13:57] <Mr_Rakjo> YEEEE
[1:13:59] <digaogrunge> GOOD CHAR PAT
[1:13:59] <LasagnaXaga> Yeah eldritch is core on Warlock. Good luck, Pat. And Witch Bolt is godlike since if it hits once it can hit 10 turns for free
[1:14:00] <%TrafficCohen> True strike is to meme on new people
[1:14:00] <%heartlesshealer> baby <3
[1:14:00] <wibbwobbler> psaSkelmo
[1:14:01] <%SABiscotti> Pat knows nerd shit
[1:14:03] <%twistedj3ster> no idea what's going on so, yes
[1:14:03] <%SpcOpsBear> True Strike was good back when it was just +20 on attack rolls in 3.X and Pathfinder
[1:14:03] <BionicPulga> HahaLean
[1:14:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> Hideous laughter is a good CC, but yeah this is good
[1:14:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> NO STACKING CONCENTRATION SPELLS
[1:14:05] <+HelloImTom08> nice
[1:14:07] <dan_g_v> I have no idea what you did
[1:14:08] <xennyvs> Hell yah Pat!
[1:14:08] <%Bailey__gaming> lets curse fools
[1:14:09] <%donkymagooterson> floppy doge

[1:14:10] <$TallYoda08> <3 <3 LUL LUL
[1:14:11] <+Cavumentum> Pat Accidentally Creates Powerful Warlock
[1:14:12] <%heartlesshealer> time to scroll down
[1:14:18] <lord_sykos> Scroll down pat
[1:14:19] <Sotetsu> Aww, Paige called Pat her Short King 👑
[1:14:20] <+XIR0> True strike is the worst spell in 5e
[1:14:20] <+pectusumbra> That looks pretty good to me. Assuming the rules are the same you'll be able to swap at least one spell per level up
[1:14:23] <+SwishamanX> best part
[1:14:24] <%Profmcstevie> The bit will fade as the boy grows
[1:14:26] <%gigabaja> scroll
[1:14:26] <$Infinite_Devil_Machine> @PatStaresAt You can also only concentrate on one concentration spell at once, where if you have a non-concentration spell aswell, you can use both with each other over the course of combat
[1:14:27] <%Grayhammatter> scroll down pat
[1:14:28] <%Frost_Quill> I've only seen one game of DnD but one player had dissonant whispers and it was REALLY good.
[1:14:30] <%Calek> @LasagnaXaga witch bolt is concentration and they just have to move out of range to cancel it
[1:14:30] <JaseAdrift> Eldritch Blasts in western
[1:14:31] <%SpcOpsBear> TIME TO SCROLL DOWN
[1:14:32] <%Spydurman> 5E made it WAYYYYY easier
[1:14:36] <+Lunarhawk> @PatStaresAt Scroll Down
[1:14:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Name him PatLock
[1:14:38] <$zyberion626> that's why 5E is fantastic
[1:14:38] <%gaomachine> Yeah 5e streamlines it a lot
[1:14:39] <Jp_DrZaius> yes
[1:14:40] <Xelgus> I think that's just you Pat
[1:14:40] <OvaltineDream> Whaaat I love Chargen
[1:14:40] <%ExpressNode> Pat is actually taking chat's advice
[1:14:41] <mechengineers> straight up my character i usually place except i usally play as an elemental
[1:14:42] <%AFlyingTaco1> Indeed
[1:14:42] <LoneFonte> not 5e tho
[1:14:44] <digaogrunge> 5E IS FOR NOOBS
[1:14:44] <+takutoots> eh it takes a couple of time to get use to it
[1:14:45] <+KR_Black> He will still frezze any time you pick him up , big dogs dont work when picked up
[1:14:45] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt If you use online methods like DND beyond it's pretty quick and painless
[1:14:45] <KeggyH> CHANGE TO FIEND
[1:14:45] <%TheLemuroid> This is literally 5e
[1:14:46] <Equirah> Eh, not realy (as long as you have an idea of what you're doing)
[1:14:47] <olaksi> If the game has a DnD based system yeah
[1:14:47] <%Wallabri> 5E more like 5Easy
[1:14:50] <danielm427> not in 5e
[1:14:50] <+melanthia_> it's organized and not just info dump
[1:14:52] <+shabop> 5e is easy baby mode
[1:14:53] <dinnydanny777> You don't feel that way in every game?
[1:14:54] <lesbosmer> yeah this is basically what its like in 5e
[1:14:55] <+pectusumbra> Can you change your ability scores at all?
[1:14:55] <DaHaLoJeDi> Yeah 5e has been a godsend for that shit even if it's not quite as customizable
[1:14:56] <Badgerconda_> 5e is for shitty babbies from tumblr.
[1:15:01] <%heartlesshealer> nice, warlocks get real armor
[1:15:02] <%DedlokPM> Not for me when I recently created a rogue in 5e @PatStaresAt rooBlank
[1:15:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> its based on 5e and there's no rulebook to flip through
[1:15:08] <LasagnaXaga> @Calek I know, I have tried it on this game. They don't tend to move out
[1:15:09] <%Totally_Not_Toby> 5e is for LOSERS
[1:15:09] <%SWFanatic> Do a flip
[1:15:11] <jtrost> @patstaresat it's kinda hard to make a bad character in 5e
[1:15:14] <%luftraumm1> 5e is very streamlined
[1:15:16] <+Pendragwn> 5e is super hard to fuck up
[1:15:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> 3.5 for life
[1:15:17] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt why even have the option of making a bad build? What's the point?
[1:15:18] <%SpcOpsBear> And in Sleight of Hand
[1:15:18] <xennyvs> 5e is great i love it
[1:15:19] <%Nny7229> un check deceptiom
[1:15:22] <TuxedoNash> You have NOT MANY spells but they come back in less time
[1:15:24] <DraxTD> we're STILL character creating??
[1:15:24] <+KR_Black> Deception and Investigation
[1:15:26] <raikagelord1> Can you make an Unarmed badass in this game?
[1:15:28] <%Nny7229> you already get deco from background
[1:15:28] <%SpcOpsBear> On your left
[1:15:28] <%Calek> @LasagnaXaga ohmahgosh
[1:15:28] <sweenicus> big lies
[1:15:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> Deception is really good, and probably Investigation
[1:15:30] <%radda343> `1thre are no skill points in 5e
[1:15:30] <+kapcommunist> orbs
[1:15:32] <%Puhff> Not points
[1:15:34] <alphonseisbest> @Badgerconda_ OK BOOMER
[1:15:35] <%aishman> Not point, proficiency. There's no skill points in 5e
[1:15:39] <Bluewolf544> ALWAYS PERCEPTION @patstaresat
[1:15:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> Arcana for sure, imo
[1:15:40] <StencilOST> Not points, proficiency
[1:15:42] <digaogrunge> GO FOR CHARISMA SKILLS, GET PERCEPTION AND INTUITION IF YOU CAN
[1:15:43] <%Nny7229> Uncheck deception!
[1:15:44] <danielm427> 3.5 is best edition
[1:15:44] <wibbwobbler> i wish i played d&d lol
[1:15:45] <%SpcOpsBear> You either HAVE proficiency or you DON'T. The bonus you get scales with level.
[1:15:46] <+Memitim> it's proficiency
[1:15:47] <%heartlesshealer> not a point, a bonus
[1:15:48] <HarmlessCrow> @DraxTD First Pat stream?
[1:15:48] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> Scales with level
[1:15:48] <@commanderclaw> Proficiency gives you a bonus that increases as you level
[1:15:48] <%Puhff> You're picking which Skills you will have Advantage for
[1:15:50] <+Pendragwn> Like you have to intentionally choose to just not play the game right to fuck up a 5e character.
[1:15:52] <+butterick> sneakyboi
[1:15:53] <%DedlokPM> @Totally_Not_Toby Then I guess Baulders Gate 3 is for losers as it uses 5e
[1:15:53] <Badgerconda_> @alphonseisbest get off my lawn, zoomer.
[1:15:55] <%heartlesshealer> a training, if you will
[1:15:55] <mikevens7> take intimidation
[1:15:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> PROFICIENCY IS A SCALING BONUS WITH LEVEL
[1:15:59] <%TrafficCohen> I always go investigation in Dnd
[1:15:59] <Frodiddly> Arcana, probably
[1:15:59] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt There's no skill points in 5e, you tag skills like in Fallout.
[1:16:01] <%radda343> no it's just proficiency, you add your proficiency modifier to skills you tag
[1:16:01] <%SpcOpsBear> Take Intimidation then
[1:16:01] <+Dorf1> wizards didnt fix that problem in 5e they literally invented it as intentional design
[1:16:02] <%Nny7229> You have deception. Uncheck it here.
[1:16:03] <+Kawaso> wis is perception
[1:16:04] <+meikae> intimidation
[1:16:05] <%Saltmeisterr> Arcana?
[1:16:05] <+KR_Black> Arcana
[1:16:06] <reasonance> which skills you can/can't pick is based on class
[1:16:06] <jestrfestr> arcana
[1:16:09] <Macfine> arcana is useful with your good int
[1:16:09] <+takutoots> this really is a nice layout though
[1:16:09] <+shabop> not a warlock skuill
[1:16:11] <+DonnieAdonis> Can we look at the skills?
[1:16:11] <olaksi> History and nature, max nerd
[1:16:12] <Wisepheonix> these are class proficencies
[1:16:12] <Equirah> You likely already have it
[1:16:15] <+gale_glory1121> Warlock Charismaintimidation is charisma
[1:16:15] <+gravis_22> Arcana
[1:16:15] <%ClericOfSparda> Arcana
[1:16:15] <%squidking96> arcana
[1:16:17] <ShichiNoBushi> How closely does this game resemble D&D? Are all checks still a d20 with a modifier?
[1:16:18] <LoneFonte> arcana?
[1:16:19] <%heartlesshealer> Inestigation sounds good
[1:16:19] <xxmagonx> arcana
[1:16:19] <%AncelDeLambert> RPing would be Arcana or History. Or Intimidation
[1:16:20] <+pectusumbra> Yeah it's not a class skill for warlocks. I'd say arcana along with investigate in that case.
[1:16:21] <therealtacopancakes> arcana
[1:16:22] <LasagnaXaga> @Calek Yup, if you have a place to hide it becomes free easy damage thanks to AI abuse. On tabletop it's not that good but here...
[1:16:23] <@SoFarFetched> INTIMIDATION
[1:16:24] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt There's no points, you're either proficient in a skill or you're not. Your proficiency bonus goes up every few levels and that effects your skills and attack.
[1:16:25] <%Wallabri> Arcana
[1:16:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> deception is from charlitain
[1:16:28] <%TrafficCohen> NERD
[1:16:30] <Mr_Rakjo> Arcana
[1:16:30] <%Nny7229> Oh that's good. they won't let you double up by accident.
[1:16:32] <%AncelDeLambert> History is good
[1:16:32] <Bluewolf544> Oh you can't take it rip
[1:16:33] <%SpcOpsBear> Your best stat is Charisma, take Intimidation you coward
[1:16:34] <%heartlesshealer> SCHOLAR <3
[1:16:34] <mikevens7> its part of your criminal background
[1:16:35] <%Rumbutt> His background gives him deception and sleight of hand, it doesn't count towards his class skills, c'mon chat
[1:16:35] <+meikae> intimidation, use that warlock charisma, baby
[1:16:37] <%squidking96> Fetched gib jojo
[1:16:40] <Ipsenscastle> arcana probs better
[1:16:40] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 23 months, but how much that dooggg weigh?
[1:16:46] <dinnydanny777> I like how there's deception and intimidation and no persuasion
[1:16:47] <+KR_Black> Arcana
[1:16:48] <%Totally_Not_Toby> @Totally_Not_Toby it might work well for a video game, here's hoping. 5e tabletop fucking sucks and takes tons of homebrew to be fun
[1:16:50] <+uselessbathhouse> or expertised
[1:16:50] <%Jay_Squirrel> whys pat blue and horny
[1:16:50] <%BigCoffee> arcana maybe ?à
[1:16:51] <%AncelDeLambert> streamlines a lot of dialogue stuff, seems good
[1:16:51] <TuxedoNash> Yes, and being proficient gives you the points
[1:16:52] <+itsgundamu> !uptime
[1:16:52] <@Moobot> @ItsAGundamu I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 17m.
[1:16:53] <LasagnaXaga> Pat you can get proficiency on stuff from backgrounds from the Origin page
[1:16:53] <%king_wragles> You can see your character sheet on the left there
[1:16:53] <Sotetsu> It's much easier to balance that way
[1:16:54] <ZComiX> yeah procieincy will just increase as you level
[1:16:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> Intimidation
[1:16:55] <%trueherobappo> This game reminds me of Divinity..
[1:16:55] <%heartlesshealer> fair
[1:16:58] <%Nny7229> Allows you to add your proficiency bonus which changes as you level.
[1:17:00] <jtrost> unless bard w/jack of all trades
[1:17:00] <Mr_Rakjo> N E R D B O Y
[1:17:01] <ShichiNoBushi> That is a concept that was introduced in 4th Edition.
[1:17:03] <%trueherobappo> Is it supposed to?
[1:17:03] <%TheLemuroid> Intimidate would play off CHA
[1:17:03] <%heartlesshealer> HERE WE GO
[1:17:04] <+captain_history> @ShichiNoBushi Quite close as far as I have seen
[1:17:06] <digaogrunge> DUMP INT
[1:17:08] <jorniev> GO FULL DIO
[1:17:11] <+XIR0> Give Big Charisma
[1:17:11] <%radda343> run cha dump str
[1:17:13] <%YakumoYomi> Point Buy System~
[1:17:14] <LoneFonte> suddenly pat gets sad
[1:17:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> Charisma, Dex, Con
[1:17:17] <%Barelyaudible> This is where you can fuck up
[1:17:19] <DaHaLoJeDi> DUMP YOUR INT
[1:17:21] <+meikae> int dump stat
[1:17:22] <Scrub_Seeker> default stat allocation looks good honestly
[1:17:23] <$lotharrio> A tiefling? I'd expect dwarf or halfling.
[1:17:24] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> DUMP INT GET DEX
[1:17:24] <Ids560> time to make con a dump stat and fall over to a slight gust of wind
[1:17:25] <%ClericOfSparda> 1 point into CHA. Odd numbers are the devil!
[1:17:25] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt If you click the ability you will see what skills they enchance
[1:17:26] <%Grayhammatter> cha dump PogChamp
[1:17:26] <%king_wragles> You can drop dex down to 10 to pump charisma up to 19
[1:17:26] <xennyvs> no reason to dump int if you dont need to lmao
[1:17:27] <mikevens7> what you have is mostly fine
[1:17:27] <%TrafficCohen> Cha dump int
[1:17:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> Charisma up
[1:17:29] <+Cavumentum> Max charisma and con, who needs intelligence
[1:17:30] <kylejefferies> Name drops the other classes on the skills.
[1:17:30] <%Parapattern> All Strength
[1:17:30] <%aishman> You want HIGH charisma
[1:17:31] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt minimum is 8 max is 15 for abilities without racial bonus
[1:17:32] <+mythmonster2> int basically doesn't matter for you
[1:17:32] <jestrfestr> you dont need intel as a warlock
[1:17:33] <%RD_nx> are you not allowed to roll?
[1:17:33] <+mczarklesby> SMASH that charisma button
[1:17:33] <lord_sykos> That's actually a good spread to start
[1:17:34] <+justianxix> uh oh, big goblins
[1:17:34] <olaksi> Arbitrarty main stats, yaaaay
[1:17:34] <OvaltineDream> STR cannot be dumped firther
[1:17:35] <%Totally_Not_Toby> 5e needs to be modified so heavily to be fun for people with any experience in tabletop that you might as well just play a different system
[1:17:36] <boywunderkind> CHA, DEX, CON important
[1:17:36] <sweenicus> numbers go up on evens, odds are a waste
[1:17:36] <+pectusumbra> nahhh, don't dump int.
[1:17:37] <digaogrunge> CHAR FOR MAIN STAT, DEX AND CON FOR SECONDARY
[1:17:40] <dinnydanny777> Is it Big Brain time?
[1:17:41] <LasagnaXaga> Warlock need big Charisma. Big Charisma is good
[1:17:42] <%seraphimjordan> proficency are bonuses to your roll modifer which is decided by your skill level
[1:17:42] <ChungusQuest> Nobody knows the history of Faerun all that well because there's TOO DAMN MUCH OF IT
[1:17:42] <%TheLemuroid> Looks like a warlock to me
[1:17:44] <tugg4> You don't need INT as a Warlock
[1:17:45] <%Wallabri> CHA, BABY
[1:17:45] <%Nny7229> get some dex and wis
[1:17:46] <$zyberion626> Charisma to 18
[1:17:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Is this based off of D&D Next/5th Edition?
[1:17:48] <%SABiscotti> DOPE
[1:17:49] <%TheWinged7> oh hey, they are using point pool system
[1:17:55] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes it's 5e
[1:17:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Warlock is Wisdom, right?
[1:18:00] <%radda343> EVEN NUMVERS INCREASE MODIFIER
[1:18:00] <xennyvs> Yeah, it's based off 5e
[1:18:00] <Mr_Rakjo> Cha to 18 would be Nice
[1:18:01] <+KR_Black> Yup
[1:18:01] <+SwishamanX> good luck retaining info from chat
[1:18:02] <Them00n> Dump int and str, pump dex and chr.
[1:18:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> what does wisdom give?
[1:18:03] <+RyuMojo> Cha to 18 for +4 bonus
[1:18:03] <+captain_history> Cha > Des > Con
[1:18:06] <%TrafficCohen> @ShichiNoBushi Yes
[1:18:07] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Try to get Charisma to 18. All warlock spells go off based on Charisma.
[1:18:07] <+shabop> Cha is as high as its gonna go boys
[1:18:07] <+TreskM> 17 is max cha he can get right now
[1:18:09] <%shruke> Dex helps keep you alive a lot
[1:18:11] <%YakumoYomi> I don't think you can pump skills to 18 here
[1:18:11] <+meikae> lol, dump con
[1:18:11] <%heartlesshealer> taking from constitution......
[1:18:13] <boywunderkind> Dump INT
[1:18:13] <%Calek> @TheWinged7 just for EA, they'll add in rolling for stats later
[1:18:15] <+ArticPath> Ch to 18 for +4 bonus
[1:18:17] <kylejefferies> Dump INT you are not wizard.
[1:18:17] <+Kawaso> don't dump con
[1:18:18] <+charlie2089> Reccomened is good.
[1:18:18] <%TheLemuroid> I can't believe how this is literally 5e
[1:18:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> hell yeah, point buy.
[1:18:18] <TuxedoNash> all of your magic relies on CHA as a wallrock
[1:18:18] <dinnydanny777> Wait you can be a stupid Warlock? LUL
[1:18:19] <+DonnieAdonis> Should he go back since he added arcana and investigation?
[1:18:20] <chopskyy> is pat broken?
[1:18:22] <StencilOST> Pat's gonna learn a lot about 5e tonight
[1:18:22] <%AncelDeLambert> oh Warlock is CHARISMA, okay that makes sense
[1:18:26] <%Wallabri> give one to cha to make the modifier higher
[1:18:26] <+mczarklesby> CON Important for keeping concentration.
[1:18:28] <%Nny7229> cha 17
[1:18:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> Cha, Dex, Con
[1:18:33] <+3amsoda> pat warlocks need charisma please
[1:18:33] <+pectusumbra> I mean get Cha to 18 if you can but I wouldn't dump int in a video game since you'll probably end up Fallout'ing it then
[1:18:34] <%Rumbutt> Con his more HP
[1:18:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat, don't drop CHA
[1:18:35] <%TheWinged7> @Calek cool, im planning to wait for act 2 at least before playing
[1:18:36] <+KR_Black> CHA 18
[1:18:36] <+XIR0> Con is just Con
[1:18:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Con Raises you HP
[1:18:37] <jtrost> Focus CHA CON DEX
[1:18:38] <$lotharrio> Constitution is HP gain on level.
[1:18:38] <Macfine> Con is big hp
[1:18:39] <jorniev> HIT POINTS
[1:18:40] <%heartlesshealer> Constitution is raw health and saves against disease and shit
[1:18:40] <LoneFonte> cha all the wa
[1:18:40] <+mythmonster2> con is just hp
[1:18:40] <%TrafficCohen> Constitution is health
[1:18:40] <GoldenEcho1> CON affects HP
[1:18:40] <%Nny7229> con is hp
[1:18:41] <LasagnaXaga> CON for concentration and health
[1:18:41] <$TheSmerdis> Dont skip the con
[1:18:41] <%JumboCrunchies> Constituion is HP, Pat
[1:18:42] <+meikae> constitution gives you hit points
[1:18:44] <%radda343> CON increases HP gain
[1:18:44] <+Cavumentum> Priority is Charisma > Con > Dex
[1:18:45] <%RD_nx> CON is health Pat
[1:18:45] <%Wallabri> CHA 18!
[1:18:46] <KeggyH> You’re gonna want con pat
[1:18:47] <Drusain> lol yeah do concentration spells with no con
[1:18:49] <tugg4> Con is also for Concentration
[1:18:51] <kylejefferies> CON is more Hp
[1:18:52] <%tizz86> CHA 17, CON 14
[1:18:52] <+shabop> con is important for your concentration
[1:18:52] <aretos1> con an dex matter
[1:18:53] <+Kawaso> your max hp is based on con
[1:18:53] <%Nny7229> max of 15 +2 from race
[1:18:54] <%SpcOpsBear> Charisma is your primary stat. Dexterity and Constitution are your secondary stats.
[1:18:55] <+TreskM> 15 is max then +2 from tiefling
[1:18:55] <digaogrunge> CON IS HP AND CONCENTRATION CHECKS, IMPORTANT FOR CASTERS
[1:18:55] <%crimsonharvest> you need HP, Warlocks want HP like woah
[1:18:57] <DaHaLoJeDi> DON'T DUMP CON you need it for Concentration saves
[1:18:57] <danielm427> max is 15
[1:18:58] <%Bailey__gaming> constitution needed for concentration and health
[1:19:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> he can't go above 18, chat
[1:19:04] <+charlie2089> Max 15, +2 from race.
[1:19:04] <%MonsterEnvy> Max of 15 you have +2 to your Charisma from your race
[1:19:07] <%Barelyaudible> dex too
[1:19:08] <Them00n> Con and dex are important
[1:19:09] <%AncelDeLambert> you're a caster, so dexterity can take a SHIT
[1:19:10] <mikevens7> higher con is better
[1:19:11] <%vaderxyz1970> UP THAT CON
[1:19:11] <boywunderkind> Is this early access free?
[1:19:11] <jorniev> CON IS ALSO FOR SPELLS
[1:19:12] <dinnydanny777> I guess Warlocks cast spells through the gift of the gab and nothing else LUL
[1:19:13] <theoverlordgopher> Most important are CHA and CON
[1:19:14] <LoneFonte> get a +1 in con?
[1:19:15] <%heartlesshealer> Dex also helps DEFENSE
[1:19:15] <+KR_Black> Chat he is a caster , he is gonna be a glass canon
[1:19:20] <Ultimatefool> Intelligence 0, Constitution 25 UNGA BUNGA
[1:19:23] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> Dex effects Evasion
[1:19:27] <hairtoday> int protects you from mind flayers
[1:19:28] <%aishman> I would choose con 14, dex 12 myself
[1:19:29] <TuxedoNash> Note at the bottom is your Proficiency Bonus. That's a maths that goes to what your proficient with, and the Bonus will increase as your level go up
[1:19:29] <amask777> everything is a dump stat
[1:19:30] <+InsufficientStats> dex for ac brother
[1:19:30] <danielm427> tank STR and WIS
[1:19:33] <digaogrunge> EVEN NUMBERS PAT
[1:19:33] <wibbwobbler> much charisma, very charismatic
[1:19:33] <alextrebeken> dude i left for like 20 mins, how is this guy still at character creation
[1:19:34] <%IminyourBase> -1 int means you dumb
[1:19:35] <$lotharrio> Good CON early on is important, because if you buy it later, it won't retroactively apply bonus HP.
[1:19:35] <%Calek> he's a caster so dump strength
[1:19:36] <%SpcOpsBear> 13 and 14 give the same stat boost
[1:19:39] <%Chimeraelite> Int for Aracana
[1:19:41] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt dex still effects AC
[1:19:41] <%barkon345> I played 3.5 for about 10 years and I like 5th edition a lot more. its way more user friendly and emphasizes role play way more
[1:19:41] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt Even numbers are better than Odd ones
[1:19:43] <DaHaLoJeDi> ME STRONG WARLOCK, NO INT ALL CON
[1:19:44] <BearWarlock> dex = ac
[1:19:44] <jtrost> Int is BIG DUMP
[1:19:44] <+pectusumbra> @PatStaresAt As a warlock you will also get Invocations later, like extra free magical abilities that can include things like skill bonuses, talking to animals, free permanent mage armor, and so on
[1:19:44] <+shabop> odd number bad. Modifier only go up on even number
[1:19:44] <%radda343> you're gonna screw over your tagged skills this way
[1:19:45] <%YakumoYomi> Doesn't Eldritch Blast count as a ranged attack, and is thus affected by Dex? Or was that just in NWN2?
[1:19:47] <twistedhands> put points into int for arcana and investigation rolls, 14 at most
[1:19:49] <%heartlesshealer> can't tell how many points left
[1:19:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Scroll to top to see your points
[1:19:54] <ScreamLord> Scoll up to see
[1:19:56] <xennyvs> @alextrebeken he's not familiar with 5e
[1:19:56] <%seraphimjordan> wisdom or intelligence
[1:19:57] <%aslfrasle> Con for HP, Dex for Attacks and Armor Class, and Cha for Spells.
[1:19:58] <%JumboCrunchies> Pat, with light armor, most of your AC will come from Dex, while CON is your HP
[1:20:00] <+CarrowayFashonti> Decrease CHA by one and up your INT
[1:20:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> at least 10 in Wisdom
[1:20:02] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt points only matter in increments fo 2 btw
[1:20:08] <dinnydanny777> Does this mean all of your attacks are just really convincing spells?
[1:20:08] <sweenicus> Shin Pat looks great btw
[1:20:08] <jestrfestr> WIS helps vs nasty spells
[1:20:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt is there a tooltip for the stats?
[1:20:11] <+Cavumentum> Charisma, Dex, and Constitution are your primary stats, int is nice window dressing most of the time
[1:20:11] <digaogrunge> NO NEED FOR INT
[1:20:14] <hairtoday> eldritch blast runs on int
[1:20:15] <BearWarlock> dexterity - your armor class
[1:20:15] <%aishman> You did
[1:20:17] <%radda343> that's fine
[1:20:18] <+Pendragwn> Dump con pussy
[1:20:19] <@commanderclaw> Yeah the recommended is pretty good
[1:20:19] <%aslfrasle> It was more than fine.
[1:20:19] <+Basilias_Maximus> Avoid odd numbers.
[1:20:19] <%heartlesshealer> YOU STILL HAVE SOME + LEFT
[1:20:22] <Them00n> Dump int
[1:20:24] <tolloponik> SHIT!!!! it's OUT!!!?
[1:20:26] <%SpcOpsBear> This is OK.
[1:20:26] <olaksi> Yeah the stat spread is dumb
[1:20:27] <kylejefferies> WARLOCKS DONT NEED INT
[1:20:27] <%Totally_Not_Toby> wis is helpfull
[1:20:28] <$lotharrio> Wisdom is important to not be mind controlled and stunned, Pat.
[1:20:29] <xennyvs> you may want to have an odd number or two tho
[1:20:30] <DaHaLoJeDi> PAT DAMN IT DUMP THE INT
[1:20:30] <danielm427> take that point form wis
[1:20:32] <+uselessbathhouse> wis is a SUPER common saving throw
[1:20:33] <twistedhands> -1 perception tho
[1:20:33] <silentblast93> cause you did
[1:20:34] <%AncelDeLambert> you do NOT need Int
[1:20:35] <LasagnaXaga> Yeah Recommended is good on this game
[1:20:37] <LoneFonte> @tolloponik act 1 only
[1:20:38] <+demon1103> man...seeing this Bladurs gate stuff today made me wanna boot up Divinity ....only to realize I uninstalled awhile back cuz storage *ugh*
[1:20:39] <%crimsonharvest> You really should take more CON than INT
[1:20:39] <HarmlessCrow> Chat this is a game where we fight Mindflayers. WE DON'T DUMP INT
[1:20:40] <%heartlesshealer> ah, it was at the top
[1:20:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> DUMP INT
[1:20:43] <aretos1> get int for story reasons if you want
[1:20:45] <%Barelyaudible> 14 constitution
[1:20:45] <cheapdoc> nope
[1:20:45] <+thoughtlock> you need way more wisdom than int
[1:20:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> No
[1:20:46] <sweenicus> you don't need int, you're charismatic
[1:20:47] <+pectusumbra> one missing point
[1:20:47] <@commanderclaw> Higher stats cost more points
[1:20:48] <+FatherGreyBeard> Is there any benefit for going 17 over 16? Since Ability score improvements give +2 anyway?
[1:20:49] <dinnydanny777> Warlocks don't need INT but he picked Eldritch Blast though???
[1:20:50] <%Nny7229> Dump str. keep int for your skills
[1:20:51] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Put Int at 10 honestly, your proficiency bonus more than makes up for the short comings.
[1:20:53] <+mczarklesby> Doesn't have to be super min-maxed, he's got enough to have fun.
[1:20:53] <raikagelord1> Dump INT
[1:20:55] <+mythmonster2> change out the int for con
[1:20:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @harmlesscrow Shit, you're right
[1:20:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> yeah, that works
[1:20:59] <%heartlesshealer> close, more averaged out here
[1:21:01] <xennyvs> that stat allocation is fine lmao
[1:21:02] <alphonseisbest> IDK47
[1:21:03] <Equirah> @HarmlessCrow that's a wis save LUL
[1:21:03] <%crimsonharvest> Youre not a wizard there's no studying or memorization in your powers, no runes to read just secrets whispered into your mind
[1:21:04] <+CarrowayFashonti> If its like 5e, you get two attribute points on level up, so you can bump CHA down to 16
[1:21:05] <hairtoday> eldritch blast runs on cha
[1:21:06] <%Nny7229> Dump str. Keep int.
[1:21:06] <%BigCoffee> less int more dex
[1:21:11] <StencilOST> That'll work
[1:21:13] <LasagnaXaga> @dinnydanny777 Yep, as a warlock he casts Eldritch with Cha
[1:21:13] <$raziel391> take 1 from int
[1:21:15] <%Barelyaudible> only even numbers
[1:21:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> He got skill bonuses for INT skills
[1:21:16] <+uselessbathhouse> you are out of points.
[1:21:16] <%JumboCrunchies> Guys this isnt pure combat D&D, he needs INT for checks and things.
[1:21:20] <jtrost> INT BAD -> dump!
[1:21:20] <%Rumbutt> Points have diminishing returns
[1:21:21] <+pectusumbra> Ahhhh, it's a SCALING sysmte, you need MORE points to go higher
[1:21:21] <mikevens7> dont listern to the people telling you to dump int. its better in the game than in dnd
[1:21:22] <$TheSmerdis> above thirteen take more points
[1:21:23] <TuxedoNash> You're getting a point to INT from Tiefling
[1:21:24] <+TreskM> 17 cha imo
[1:21:24] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Each tier of better scores costs more points per score increase
[1:21:25] <%heartlesshealer> As you get higher numbers, they need more points to bump in creation
[1:21:26] <%Nny7229> keep cha 17.
[1:21:26] <MegaXZerolegends> No its the point buy
[1:21:27] <+Pendragwn> I wonder if you can do a coffeelock
[1:21:28] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt yup, and you only get increases to roll in incriments fo 2
[1:21:28] <kylejefferies> @dinnydanny777 Warlocks cast with CHA
[1:21:29] <HarmlessCrow> Everyone wanting to dump int is gonna get their shit pushed in by Int Devourers
[1:21:29] <+FatherGreyBeard> Given the focus on Mindflayers, INT will probably be somewhat common.
[1:21:32] <digaogrunge> LOSE A POINT IN CHA
[1:21:32] <+KR_Black> Str is carry weight right ?
[1:21:34] <%crimsonharvest> Cost scales, pat
[1:21:35] <dinnydanny777> You don't need INT you're charismatic is a perfect motto for life
[1:21:35] <%MonsterEnvy> Ability scores cost more the more point syou put into them
[1:21:35] <%ChestMimik> Who need int when fireball do trick
[1:21:37] <%Nny7229> then it will be easier to level.
[1:21:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> If he dumps INT it defeats the purpose of choosing Arcana and Investigation
[1:21:39] <jestrfestr> they start to cost 2 cus video games
[1:21:40] <Frodiddly> Points aren't 1=1, they scale up in cost
[1:21:40] <%radda343> each point costs omre as the score goes up
[1:21:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> INCREASING COSTS
[1:21:44] <%heartlesshealer> HIGH NUMBERS = HIGH COST IN CREATION
[1:21:45] <%Chimeraelite> Costs more points the higher the stats
[1:21:49] <+shabop> 14 and 15 cost 2 each
[1:21:49] <aretos1> if you want to minmax you should go for another subrace, no?
[1:21:49] <olaksi> Why even have all these stats that don't matter?
[1:21:51] <%huskarl_zap> Its hard capped to not start with 18 anything
[1:21:51] <%Nny7229> He has int skills guys.
[1:21:55] <+Kawaso> 14 14 16 isn't bad
[1:21:59] <Jp_DrZaius> HIGHER LEVELS NEEDS MORE POINTS
[1:21:59] <kylejefferies> Going from 16 to 17 costs more than 10 to 11
[1:22:01] <zeremar14> increasing costs pat
[1:22:02] <StencilOST> Point buy rules. the cost dont scale even with the increase in tstat
[1:22:03] <Them00n> Dump int and pump chr
[1:22:03] <+mythmonster2> that's probably fine
[1:22:05] <Bluewolf544> I think it's point buy system chat
[1:22:05] <Scrub_Seeker> the recommended was good honestly
[1:22:11] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt i would REALLY reccomend you go with recomended
[1:22:11] <Macfine> they matter for other things @olaksi
[1:22:12] <%Totally_Not_Toby> dump con coward
[1:22:14] <$zyberion626> @olaksi they matter to other classes/builds
[1:22:14] <%coffeeabomination> i COME BACK TO THIS CURSED SHIT??
[1:22:16] <Equirah> @Jp_DrZaius that's a lie
[1:22:18] <$lotharrio> That looks perfect.
[1:22:18] <%Totally_Not_Toby> be squishy
[1:22:19] <aretos1> @olaksi they matter for other classes
[1:22:20] <+Jorgon_Skylisk> You don't "NEED" CHA at 17
[1:22:20] <Coystick> Tieflings are losers
[1:22:22] <+shabop> odd number bad
[1:22:23] <%Nny7229> Get some cha skills.
[1:22:26] <+PrinnyNorth> point buy system
[1:22:27] <%huskarl_zap> I wouldnt recommend -1 ever but do whatever you wish.
[1:22:28] <CuttleCrow> 2 odd NotLikeThis
[1:22:30] <+thoughtlock> perception would be better than investigation
[1:22:33] <HarmlessCrow> Just dump Str and Dex like a true wizard chad
[1:22:34] <LoneFonte> CHA 16, INT 12
[1:22:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> Dex should also dictate your AC, which is the likelyhood you are to get hit
[1:22:39] <$SweetCheeksTVR> still on character creation?
[1:22:39] <dinnydanny777> The INTelligent thing to do is to be stupid? :)
[1:22:39] <%vaderxyz1970> Whats the likely hood hes going to find a +1 charisma island in act 1?
[1:22:40] <olaksi> @zyberion626 Right, why are they even available for this one though?
[1:22:41] <Them00n> Dex is important for AC, con for hp and concentration
[1:22:43] <+BallerSwagBro9k> FATE GO CANELOT MOVIE TRAILER DROPPED LETS GOOOOO
[1:22:44] <+h_amica> Bc the class
[1:22:44] <Macfine> 16 cha is as good as 17
[1:22:44] <+TreskM> Yeah
[1:22:46] <+Pendragwn> Yes
[1:22:47] <%heartlesshealer> hover over them?
[1:22:47] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, class
[1:22:48] <chaumiester> Cuz you fat
[1:22:48] <%secretspud> you already have it
[1:22:49] <%Chimeraelite> yes
[1:22:50] <%Nny7229> But have 17 in cha means you only need 1 point when to level it at lvl 5.
[1:22:50] <jhamez_94> Class restricted
[1:22:51] <Ids560> yes
[1:22:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Perception is not a skill for Warlorkcs
[1:22:52] <Equirah> @PatStaresAt go with 16 cha and either int or wis at 12, no point in having cha 17
[1:22:52] <%radda343> class changes what you can be proficient in
[1:22:52] <penitentpentwitch> Not a class skill
[1:22:53] <+mythmonster2> warlocks can't ge tit
[1:22:53] <%huskarl_zap> @CuttleCrow he can even them every four levels
[1:22:53] <+CarrowayFashonti> It is because of your Class
[1:22:54] <xennyvs> watching chat tear itself apart trying to optimize a character based on the tabletop is hilarious
[1:22:54] <+shabop> yes
[1:22:54] <mikevens7> class and background
[1:22:54] <%heartlesshealer> oh, yeah class
[1:22:54] <jorniev> BACKSTORY
[1:22:55] <LasagnaXaga> Class, but you can get Perc from a background Pat
[1:22:55] <Goodvibes99508> yep
[1:22:57] <+pectusumbra> Yes. Class and Background determine proficiency
[1:22:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Rangers
[1:22:59] <%aslfrasle> Class and Background determine available skill proficiencies
[1:22:59] <%Barelyaudible> nothing
[1:22:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, it's becaue Perception isn;t a proficiency skill.
[1:23:00] <digaogrunge> CLASS AND BACKGROUND CHOICES
[1:23:00] <%SvenHolgersson> NOTHING
[1:23:02] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[1:23:02] <%Nny7229> Skip nature. haha
[1:23:04] <Coystick> FUCK Nature
[1:23:04] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k I hope that movie will be good
[1:23:04] <cherrycottontail> Your class/background doesn't have access
[1:23:05] <@commanderclaw> Being Steve Irwin
[1:23:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can't learn to see better
[1:23:06] <+meikae> background may have given you perception as well
[1:23:06] <%PlainSimpleTailor> PlainSimpleTailor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Pat I'm totally new to Among Us and for some reason 12 yr old kids are using it to cruise for 'girlfriends' and others are talking about how I should 'trust in the PP'. Should I beat a hasty retreat?
[1:23:06] <Jp_DrZaius> lol
[1:23:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> nature: will this mushroom kill me?
[1:23:10] <$zyberion626> @olaksi because he's still going to need to use them
[1:23:13] <+EscoSul> who needs natures anyway
[1:23:13] <+RyuMojo> Lorax's malding LUL
[1:23:14] <%crimsonharvest> In D&D nature is insufferable and sucks in every case
[1:23:14] <%TrafficCohen> You don't have the option based on your class, subclass, race and background @PatStaresAt
[1:23:22] <dinnydanny777> Maybe you can turn into a doggo though
[1:23:25] <Manwad> aw sick GOO patron
[1:23:30] <Gallhint> a friend of mine who has no clue who Pat is just sent me a link about Genshins awful drop rates LUL
[1:23:32] <thesugardaddy111> nature is stuff like knowing what u can eat and for druids
[1:23:34] <sophienatorz_unite> pat is cinderella hes out here singin with the birds
[1:23:35] <+charlie2089> You'd get perception from race or background. @PatStaresAt
[1:23:37] <%SpcOpsBear> A Warlock having no Arcana makes sense though.
[1:23:37] <%huskarl_zap> "WTF is nature good for?" one of the first places you go to is a druid grove
[1:23:37] <LasagnaXaga> So is Pat a follower of Cthulhu on this game?
[1:23:38] <%heartlesshealer> looks good?
[1:23:40] <TuxedoNash> @Order_of_Mystery hilariously enough, not even - that's Survival
[1:23:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> that works
[1:23:41] <%Nny7229> good skills
[1:23:41] <mikevens7> good
[1:23:43] <@commanderclaw> Seems good man

[1:23:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> yep
[1:23:46] <%vaderxyz1970> @Order_of_Mystery Thats why you boost CON
[1:23:46] <%MonsterEnvy> I would bring Charisma down to 16
[1:23:47] <+RyuMojo> Yep
[1:23:48] <$zyberion626> sure
[1:23:48] <%SpcOpsBear> You don't understand how the magic works, you just pray to Cthulhu and he gives it to you.
[1:23:49] <danielm427> 16 CHA
[1:23:49] <%Wallabri> Good
[1:23:49] <digaogrunge> SURE

[1:23:55] <%TrafficCohen> psaUp psaUp
[1:23:58] <%TheWinged7> good, but if you ant to min max int 12 wis 16
[1:24:00] <%heartlesshealer> cast sells
[1:24:01] <GrandMazterNelson> @PatStaresAt looks dandy
[1:24:02] <%Nny7229> At level 5 you can get int and cha leveled up once.
[1:24:02] <%Totally_Not_Toby> you can lose a cha point and it doesn't make the stat go down
[1:24:06] <TheHeroAppears> CAST l'S?
[1:24:07] <+Cavumentum> Just hit it
[1:24:09] <%heartlesshealer> Pat why would you click it

[1:24:27] <alphonseisbest> YES, YES U DID
[1:24:27] <+pectusumbra> Mmmm. But @Totally_Not_Toby keeping it at 17 means it will hit 18 4 levels earlier
[1:24:27] <digaogrunge> 14 INT IS BAD
[1:24:29] <+Kawaso> dex is good at 14
[1:24:30] <+gale_glory1121> At least you know it's a good reccomend
[1:24:30] <$zyberion626> switch DEX and INT tho
[1:24:31] <tanarath> @totally_not_toby But at 4, he can get 18
[1:24:31] <jorniev> CHAPAT

[1:24:41] <%Calek> @lotharrio unfortunately just standard PHB stuff for now
[1:24:41] <LordOfThePoultry> int is garbage
[1:24:41] <dinnydanny777> Who could have foreseen such an occurrence? limesGiggle
[1:24:41] <%heartlesshealer> this is fine

[1:24:43] <%secretspud> venture forth my guy

[1:24:47] <TheHeroAppears> MORE CHARACTER CREATOR
[1:24:48] <DaHaLoJeDi> also helps your armor
[1:24:49] <%MonsterEnvy> I would take out one point in Charisma to put it elsewhere
[1:24:51] <%SpcOpsBear> INT is garbage
[1:24:53] <+Thakan_dar> 5e in a nutshell tbh
[1:24:53] <xennyvs> Don't dump Int lmao, youre going against psychic enemies
[1:24:55] <OvaltineDream> Nice smooth brain
[1:24:56] <tolloponik> why is Pat in Sleep mode?

[1:25:00] <%fakeburg> Bawp Bawp BAWWWWWWWAAAP
[1:25:00] <+pectusumbra> Why not make Int and Dex both 13 and split the difference?
[1:25:00] <@commanderclaw> DOG IS EASY TO KILL
[1:25:01] <%SpcOpsBear> Reduce INT, increase WIS
[1:25:02] <+Scevda> !uptime

[1:25:22] <mikevens7> dont listern to the people telling you to dump int. its better in the game than in dnd

[1:25:27] <Jp_DrZaius> POINT GOBLINS
[1:25:27] <TuxedoNash> That extra point in CHA can go elsewhere tho

[1:25:30] <$zyberion626> it's fine chatroom, this isn't 3.5 we don't need to spend 6 hours making an OP character
[1:25:31] <Guyshane> Y'all are just out here like "How do mindflayers fight?"
[1:25:31] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Would take out one of your Charisma as 17 does not do much for you. And that frees up two points

[1:25:48] <%AFlyingTaco1> Did Pat's character work in a silver mine?
[1:25:49] <%Nny7229> keep cha 17
[1:25:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> @krabthecrab really? When the books are $50 a pop?
[1:25:59] <danielm427> 12 WIS
[1:26:03] <Grandma_Amari> Mindflayers can drain int I think, dunno how that'd play in this though
[1:26:05] <xennyvs> Take armor of shadows when you get invocations and thatll fix your ac problem
[1:26:07] <$lotharrio> Yeah but when you level up later, you can get it higher.
[1:26:07] <@commanderclaw> Higher scores cost more to increase
[1:26:09] <%secretspud> keep it and venture forth
[1:26:10] <%MonsterEnvy> You get 2 pointsin Charisma
[1:26:10] <%Nny7229> You get two +1s at level 5
[1:26:12] <MegaXZerolegends> You are fine.
[1:26:12] <mikevens7> just use recommended
[1:26:12] <Coystick> Isn't charisma really important to a Warlock?
[1:26:13] <%Calek> give it io wisdom
[1:26:13] <%seraphimjordan> there decided by 2s
[1:26:13] <+esdiorguthre> i love purple pat
[1:26:14] <Ids560> dump some more int and get up to 18
[1:26:15] <tanarath> you can get 18 cha at lvl 4 with 17 cha @patstaresat
[1:26:16] <Jp_DrZaius> just go
[1:26:17] <TuxedoNash> Two points for Wisdom with those points
[1:26:17] <%Totally_Not_Toby> apparently you can buff it in four levels, which will give you bonuses at 18
[1:26:19] <dinnydanny777> Do melee characters have to split between four important stats?
[1:26:19] <+mczarklesby> Leave it, and you can get to 18 quicker
[1:26:19] <%heartlesshealer> fine
[1:26:19] <Daskolin> Wait for levelup?! Magix item?
[1:26:19] <Them00n> Keep it
[1:26:22] <+Creggamonsta> is the game crashing like crazy for anyone else?
[1:26:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> good thing you wasted all that fime because I just got back
[1:26:23] <krabthecrab> @Melchior_the_Wise The character creator is free tho
[1:26:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Ok
[1:26:27] <+Kawaso> looks good
[1:26:27] <tonfirean> you can bump it to 18 faster if you leave it, I guess.
[1:26:28] <Xelgus> in 5e you gain stat points at certain levels. you need 17 if you want 18 later
[1:26:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> Good
[1:26:32] <+Cavumentum> just don't get hit
[1:26:32] <%RD_nx> @patstaresat you look like Brock from God of War
[1:26:33] <LasagnaXaga> That is fine, Pat
[1:26:33] <+RyuMojo> That's good
[1:26:36] <%asgard147> okay
[1:26:38] <Aydarkzero> elf Pat?
[1:26:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> leave it, then level charisma to 18 when you can! you get better bonuses, and charisma is your casting stat, so you need that shit as high as it'll go
[1:26:42] <%ChestMimik> So it's you but tall
[1:26:42] <sweenicus> basically pat then
[1:26:43] <olaksi> That's great PAt
[1:26:43] <Drusain> you're not wise wis is at 10
[1:26:44] <LoneFonte> just go, pat
[1:26:44] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> and you cant lift a stick

[1:40:16] <@SoFarFetched> @YakumoYomi though they also said this game would be "too strong" for consoles
[1:40:18] <%Calek> if short rest abilities refresh after combat, monks are going to be busted

[1:40:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> yo, the integration is insane
[1:40:23] <Drusain> you have 10 HP kill them illithids
[1:40:27] <%MisterCrimson> anyone using the extension, click the icon on the left of the screen
[1:40:31] <%SpcOpsBear> The Twitch integration is like the party interface for the Neverwinter Nights games, it's hella cool.
[1:40:31] <1matheuw> L for log i think
[1:40:32] <dinnydanny777> What are we, some kind of parasite?
[1:40:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> NAUGHTALOID IS SUCH A COOL WORD

[1:40:49] <DSD24> This stat stuff is cool
[1:40:56] <@SoFarFetched> @Bailey__gaming lets you see pat's character stats and vote on dialogue choices
[1:40:56] <Aydarkzero> we can only use the extension for when he enters a conversation right?
[1:40:56] <$zyberion626> Oh wow that extension is cool!
[1:40:59] <xennyvs> Pat do you have any inventory sorting tips for a person that had never done it much?

[1:41:07] <ZilverZap> ITS YOUR STAND
[1:41:07] <tonfirean> This integration seems like it might have enough junk in there to play D&D over Twitch.
[1:41:13] <aretos1> Use eldritch blast
[1:41:17] <%linSP> ASSTRAL PROJECT
[1:41:17] <+maynardftw> Had to go, just got back, does chat give quick thumbs up or quick thumbs down to everything so far
[1:41:18] <%SpcOpsBear> Also, having a Tiefling named Patron is LORE-FRIENDLY. Tieflings sometimes take words representing a concept dear to them as an assumed name.
[1:41:18] <+RyuMojo> That's real strong
[1:41:19] <%heartlesshealer> Twitch gives us a button on the Left of the overly to see all of pat's character info except for inventory

[1:44:46] <%bvanbove> Okay...mentally working out how much buying a new PC is and whether it's worth it to just play this. Looks real good.
[1:44:48] <tonfirean> Is it local multiplayer?
[1:44:48] <+Mogsn> It say "dippable" in the daggers stats!
[1:44:56] <%Axellogic> I dont understand how to even use this extension
[1:44:57] <+Estuko> @kekkerscrew like time travelers? And I'm asking as a person with basic basic knowledge on this stuff so forgive me lmao
[1:45:00] <thesugardaddy111> well the thing about mindflayers is there a parasite that I think can attach themselves to pretty much anything
[1:45:02] <%barkon345> damn I knew you had ordered the 3080, but I didn't know you had already had it delivered and installed in your PC
[1:45:12] <%Grayhammatter> LUL

[1:45:56] <madogod> is elmo dead?
[1:45:56] <@SoFarFetched> @Axellogic when you hover over the stream two popups should show,with pat's character showing on the screen.
[1:46:00] <ZeroYabuki> Its almost like it a DnD game
[1:46:00] <sendart> Brain worm going nom nom nom
[1:46:03] <%kekkerscrew> @Estuko Yep, Mind flayers are time travelers, They're the rulers of a huge space empire in the distant future, who traveled back in time.
[1:46:05] <fon_spark> Is this the new fire emblem?
[1:46:06] <@SoFarFetched> Unless you're mobile,it doens't work on mobile.
[1:46:07] <%Meekest> Zangief perk up
[1:46:19] <1matheuw> 6 seconds is a turn right?
[1:46:20] <%Axellogic> I only see the companion icon
[1:46:25] <%SpcOpsBear> also who the fuck makes the unit of measurement meters in D&D
[1:46:27] <%vaderxyz1970> That was your movement action
[1:46:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't forget all of your spells on your quick menu
[1:46:28] <%SpcOpsBear> this isn't star wars d20
[1:46:33] <+Nothing_Wild> “NOOOO, YOU CAN’T EAT MY BRAIN AND TURN ME INTO A MINDFLAYER!”
[1:46:33] <@SoFarFetched> Do you have the thing enabled?
[1:46:35] <dereks0n> Anyone know if the companions classes are changeable like in Divinity 2 or hard locked?
[1:46:38] <ZilverZap> that fire sword buff didnt last very long
[1:46:44] <alphonseisbest> @Estuko do we know why they time traveled backwards?
[1:46:50] <%ChrisAlgoo> fookin
[1:46:51] <Slimeking_Mike> I love the funy squids

[1:46:56] <%Axellogic> I gave it permission to use my twitch id but then it did nothing
[1:47:00] <dinnydanny777> That's not a knife
[1:47:05] <@SoFarFetched> probably try a refresh
[1:47:09] <ZilverZap> dip it in MIND FLAYERS BLOOD PAT
[1:47:13] <%vaderxyz1970> THAT MINDFLAYER HAS 71 HEALTH COPASITY AT LV1

[1:47:29] <%FacetiousAF> edge Kreygasm
[1:47:33] <+RyuMojo> Is there a key to see interactable items in world?
[1:47:40] <@SoFarFetched> @GarbageNirvana you're pretty on time actually cause all stuff before hand was just character creation.
[1:47:45] <MattyValor> how is this game so far?
[1:47:45] <+Nothing_Wild> @dereks0n Locked, for the time being. They’re looking into their options, but for story reasons, things like warlock pacts are a lot harder to change.
[1:47:48] <%Calek> that Mindflayer had 71 hp goodness gracious
[1:47:53] <Captain_Doomsday> This is ELABORATE
[1:47:54] <ZilverZap> Game is a coward for not allowing you to dip it in mind flayer blood
[1:48:04] <%Calek> that is specific as balls
[1:48:08] <T_Sasquatch> this is going to be hell on console
[1:48:10] <1matheuw> mechanical depth moderfckers
[1:48:12] <TuxedoNash> when it comes to hiding you need to consider Line of Sight
[1:48:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Kinda wanted to see char creator tho
[1:48:15] <tonfirean> Dip your longsword into a fountain to get Excalibur
[1:48:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> you have a resurectuin scroll, can you use it on the mind flayer?
[1:48:16] <@SoFarFetched> @T_Sasquatch It's only going to be PC
[1:48:29] <+mythmonster2> time to skyrim crouch everywhere
[1:48:31] <Coystick> This is more like an Isometric Immersive Sim
[1:48:32] <Slimeking_Mike> LIGHT GEMS
[1:48:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Much Obscure. Wow.
[1:48:38] <%MonsterEnvy> Then you turn on turn based mode and use this to sneak past enemies
[1:48:38] <digaogrunge> THE OPPOSITE
[1:48:39] <thesugardaddy111> oh yeah use the resurrection scroll on the mindflayer
[1:48:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> BIG MONEY GAME
[1:48:42] <ZilverZap> any chance this will be ported over to switch Kappa
[1:48:43] <+Nothing_Wild> @garbagenirvana He was in there for a bit.
[1:48:46] <bleugh> big league

[1:48:51] <MattyValor> isn't this coming to Stadia?
[1:48:52] <ZephynM> ZephynM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Yo
[1:48:52] <+esdiorguthre> biggly reveled
[1:48:57] <%kekkerscrew> @Estuko Bunch of different reasons. Basically wars and such were ravaging their race. Other spiecies rose up against them. So they ported to the past where people wouldn't be as advanced.
[1:49:01] <arkv01> I can feel the money going through my digestive system
[1:49:04] <%Calek> can any class use magic scrolls?
[1:49:17] <@SoFarFetched> @MattyValor I said what I said Kappa only PC

[1:49:39] <Them00n> You just cast a spell
[1:49:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @Calek it's probably like everything else, you need points in Arcana to do it
[1:49:42] <%Wallabri> you're level 20 now, Gief's too powerful
[1:49:44] <hairtoday> HE IS TOO POWERFUL
[1:49:47] <bone_reaper69> shouda made Zangief in the create a character
[1:49:50] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[1:49:55] <+FatherGreyBeard> @calek you can only use a spell scroll if the spell is on your spell list. Thieves, a subclass or rogue, can eventually use them as well.
[1:49:57] <%barrakuta371> a back wind spell LUL
[1:49:57] <amask777> warning don't forget to save - there isn't really an autosave i saw a streamer lose an hour and a half progress
[1:49:58] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Remember that you can freely cast your cantrips
[1:50:02] <ojama1987> @Aydarkzero If the first room is demanding you can tweak your settings as the game starts

[1:50:11] <Manwad> geif can cast Charm Person at will
[1:50:16] <%GarbageNirvana> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:50:16] <ZilverZap> probably because DOS2 made them big bucks
[1:50:17] <arkv01> gief is about to cast lvl 100 mini on your loins
[1:50:18] <SubjectX07x> Eldritch Blast?
[1:50:19] <Badgerconda_> That's because of wizards SJW money
[1:50:20] <$lotharrio> Eldritch Blast is what you should always use.
[1:50:21] <%SABiscotti> Wizards probably dumped big money into this
[1:50:23] <Sagata_> it has dnd fuck off money
[1:50:27] <+GenesisKnight> Eldritch BLAST
[1:50:27] <%AzureGale> I bet they're bankrolled by Wizards of the Coast
[1:50:28] <+Jrockoni> how is pat gonna deal with the warlock spellslot limit?
[1:50:29] <%Rumbutt> Free lasers
[1:50:29] <Aydarkzero> @Aydarkzero ah that makes sense actually
[1:50:33] <%WhereIsWill> that was SICK
[1:50:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> PogChamp
[1:50:34] <NeonNobleKalzeria> oh right it's D&D
[1:50:34] <1matheuw> eldritch BLAST!!
[1:50:35] <dinnydanny777> That looked cool
[1:50:35] <%Calek> that's a bigger pop than what I was expecting
[1:50:36] <TuxedoNash> yeah it do
[1:50:37] <jorniev> YO
[1:50:39] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Eldritch Blast is your BNB as a warlock
[1:50:41] <%vaderxyz1970> BLAAAAASTTTTT
[1:50:42] <cheapdoc> Times have changed and you're OLD
[1:50:43] <digaogrunge> FUCK ELDRITCH BLAST IS COOL
[1:50:43] <Coystick> Eldritch Blast is the best cantrip
[1:50:45] <+TreskM> Eldritch blast is the shit
[1:50:45] <+Pixel_Matt> rooPog
[1:50:46] <Manwad> ELDRITCH BLAAAAST
[1:50:47] <%Mr_Pylon> nah cantrips are great now
[1:50:47] <+XIR0> Eldritch blast is super strong so it's fitting
[1:50:47] <+CarrowayFashonti> Eldritch Blast is the Strongest Cantrip in the game
[1:50:48] <%aidoru_jam> delicious eldritch blast
[1:50:48] <+pectusumbra> B l a s t
[1:50:48] <+Nothing_Wild> I think they’re wanting this game to be a hit.
[1:50:49] <%ChestMimik> Cantrips have reliable damage options now
[1:50:49] <%shruke> that was your 1st level spell tho
[1:50:51] <gyde42> lol what SJW money?
[1:50:51] <%TheLemuroid> Warlocks rely on cantrips
[1:50:52] <snaggletusks> warlocks have the best cantrip in the game
[1:50:52] <+h_amica> EB is the best damage cantrip in the game tbh
[1:50:53] <ZilverZap> so anyways i started eldritch BLASTIN
[1:50:53] <SubjectX07x> Is pat a warlock? If so literally your main ability is Eldritch Blast, it is 90% of your kit.
[1:50:53] <KingVeeo> Agnoizing Blast tho
[1:50:54] <mazingmax> ITS A SONIC BOOM
[1:50:54] <+hologram_sam> eld blast is best
[1:50:55] <+mczarklesby> Yeah, Eldritch Blast is like THE Best cantrip, and upgradable.
[1:50:55] <+moustascheman> eldritch blast is the best
[1:50:55] <Badgerconda_> eldritch blast isn't really the same as other cantrips.
[1:50:57] <EternalJedi> Warlock cantrips are the REAL SHIT
[1:50:57] <%Nekros4442> ELDRITCH BLAST IS A CHAD
[1:50:58] <+captain_history> 5e cantrips are goood
[1:50:59] <Xelgus> Eldritch blast is 50% of what you do as a warlock
[1:51:00] <FrostedZaibatsu> what cmonBruh
[1:51:00] <Equirah> There's still cantrips like that LUL
[1:51:00] <Rand004> oh yea cantrips are abit better
[1:51:00] <%TrafficCohen> Eldritch BLAAAAST
[1:51:01] <Sagata_> its thier core ability dude
[1:51:01] <ZComiX> there are small cobat cantrops but WARLOCKS have the mpst pop spells
[1:51:02] <%ChestMimik> So anyways I started ELDRITCH BLASTIN
[1:51:03] <reonome> you got a problem with blacks pat?
[1:51:03] <%darthfodder> Warlocks are typically Eldritch Blast machines
[1:51:03] <Grandma_Amari> Eldritch Blast is one of the Warlock's single best spells and it's a cantrip
[1:51:04] <NeonNobleKalzeria> D&D 5e Cantrips scale on character level and are super free now
[1:51:05] <+mythmonster2> cantrips are good now, they're basically swinging a sword for magic users
[1:51:05] <Them00n> Eldritch Blast is the strongest ranged cantrip in the game, only Warlocks can cast it. @PatStaresAt
[1:51:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Cantrips are actually useful now
[1:51:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Eldrich B L A T
[1:51:07] <%SpcOpsBear> Eldritch Blast is BEST
[1:51:09] <jhamez_94> Eldritch Blast will also get stronger as you level up
[1:51:09] <%MonsterEnvy> You also have mage hand check it out
[1:51:16] <%ZephynM> hope you're all doing well
[1:51:19] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Check out your mage hand ability.
[1:51:19] <%SpcOpsBear> At higher level you get to shoot multiple blasts
[1:51:20] <+Memitim> Warlocks are basically fighters that shoot spooky magic at people instead of hitting them with sticks
[1:51:20] <+CarrowayFashonti> At 20th level, you get 4 Eldrith Blasts a turn Pat
[1:51:21] <Manwad> Eldritch BLAM
[1:51:21] <$lotharrio> They beefed up Cantrips to just be every turn magic attacks. For Warlocks especially, you should solve most fights with Eldritch Blast.
[1:51:23] <+pectusumbra> To be fair eldritch blast is kind of compensation for Warlocks getting short changed in a lot of other areas
[1:51:23] <ZilverZap> can you imagine what level 10 spells will be like
[1:51:24] <VioletRosefall> Gief wants noms
[1:51:24] <+Kyma1020> Eldritch Blaaast
[1:51:24] <%Grayhammatter> eldritch BLAT
[1:51:26] <ShichiNoBushi> I deal 1d3 damage.
[1:51:28] <%gaomachine> Eldritch blast can get downright STUPID on higher level warlocks
[1:51:29] <%secretspud> When in doubt: Eldritch Blast
[1:51:32] <1matheuw> eldritch BLATCH!!! is the shit
[1:51:33] <+Nothing_Wild> Straight up the best cantrip in the game.
[1:51:37] <thesugardaddy111> bro cantrips are the warlocks main thing, E L D R I T C H B L A S T!!!!!!!!
[1:51:38] <Captain_Doomsday> Someone feed the baby
[1:51:39] <%Axellogic> I see
[1:51:40] <+Kawaso> eldritch blast basically makes you an archer but with magic
[1:51:40] <TheHeroAppears> !uptime
[1:51:41] <@Moobot> @TheHeroAppears I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 51m.
[1:51:42] <datlambo458> gief watching in wait
[1:51:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> if eldritch invocations are a thing, then you can make eldritch blast even crazier. push enemies away, snipe them from a mile off!
[1:51:43] <tonfirean> can't trip over these cantrips
[1:51:43] <%asgard147> "Gimme food Dad" psaDogchamp
[1:51:45] <BoneofMalkav> These spells went from "Toss a coin to your Witcher..." to "Blackened in the end...."
[1:51:46] <%rdark_ksu> yea cantrips used to be like dazzling lights or some pansy shit
[1:51:47] <Grandma_Amari> Watching Gief's eyes follow the food is hilarious
[1:51:51] <+1buckboom> 1buckboom subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Yo keep feeding that good boi!
[1:51:53] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You also have Mage hand test that out Pat
[1:51:55] <@commanderclaw> Tutorial heals
[1:51:55] <%Rumbutt> Heling tentacles
[1:51:56] <%Axellogic> So the extension hates javascript blockers
[1:52:00] <ergulor> is a heal conch
[1:52:00] <ChungusQuest> I used to pump INT, but then they changed what INT was...now what I pumped isn't INT, and what is INT seems weird and scary to me. IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU!
[1:52:03] <jtrost> @patstaresat Cantrips scale with character level in 5e, Eldritch Blast can easily be your main damage source through all levels
[1:52:03] <ZilverZap> go over to the blue tentacle hentai creature
[1:52:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> puppy stare at food
[1:52:05] <+KingXANA> Only thing scarier than a food beast is a MANBEAST

[2:05:35] <raikagelord1> What would have happened if he saved it?
[2:05:38] <+blaze__drag> I'm on desktop and I can see a little icon come up when I hover over the screen but it doesn't do anything
[2:05:41] <%Axellogic> @blaze__drag also if you have a script blocker is blocks it
[2:05:43] <SirDonko> I see stats on the overlay but no voting during anytime
[2:05:51] <%RD_nx> @b_aleph when I scrolled over the video feed on my desktop, it asked if I wanted to use the overlay, I clicked yes, if it isn't showing up for you maybe something is off
[2:05:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @macathelo it's *assert..... also gross
[2:05:53] <Bluewolf544> Isn't the brain a pet
[2:05:54] <@SoFarFetched> @blaze__drag you need to click on it to install it.
[2:05:57] <%mikessdd> Gonna buy this game and find out what happens now. Brilliant
[2:05:58] <+Nothing_Wild> The intellect devourer helps him out if he does.
[2:06:01] <+Jaysky> Gura really at 699k already?
[2:06:03] <%Aztec50> I had to refresh the page to see it
[2:06:06] <NeonNobleKalzeria> oh it was a noscript thing
[2:06:08] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaGib huggNani
[2:06:14] <+Nothing_Wild> Though I don’t if it helps later on.
[2:06:16] <+KingXANA> I was playing Kingmaker and went 4 rounds without rolling above a 3 and just said fuck it before restarting the whole fight.There will probably be a lot of that here.
[2:06:17] <%Frost_Quill> Is the overlay only for subscribers?
[2:06:18] <Bluewolf544> a
[2:06:20] <42nfl19> so does the target and roll take into account any modifiers he has? it looked like a flat d20 roll
[2:06:29] <%coreyyotto> It was autoinstalled for me, I just had to link my twitch account. But I already have Better TTV so tha tmight have something to do with it.
[2:06:33] <+KingXANA> Yes
[2:06:35] <+blaze__drag> do I need to hit "add to my channel"?
[2:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> @Frost_Quill if you're on mobile it won't work,you need desktop to install the overlay.
[2:06:54] <Macfine> @42nfl19 yeah it does it in reverse, the target is lowered based on the modifiers, so you just see what you need to hit on the dice
[2:06:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat was wrong about the overlay!!, you type the 1's and 2's
[2:06:55] <+JustToWatch> you need to refresh the page after enabling
[2:06:56] <%coreyyotto> @blaze__drag that's for streamers
[2:07:00] <%Frost_Quill> I'm watching two streams of this at once, the other stream doesn't have the overlay.
[2:07:01] <$joylent_blue> blaze__drag no, just make sure the "visible" part is checked
[2:07:03] <+KingXANA> I think there's an option to show more of the numbers in the rolls.
[2:07:07] <+GingerStrawhat> Alright that was a pain in the ass but I got the overlay installed
[2:07:11] <+Centrilion> I just ahd to refresh the page and it was working
[2:07:25] <$boomboxvillain> what did a miss?
[2:07:27] <%Frost_Quill> @SoFarFetched I'm on desktop and I have the overlay, I was just questioning for other people's benefit.
[2:07:28] <$boomboxvillain> Pee break?
[2:07:30] <+blaze__drag> it is
[2:07:35] <@SoFarFetched> no it's for everyone
[2:07:38] <%TheLemuroid> Pee break
[2:07:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Seeing Pats Character sheet is pretty sweet ngl
[2:07:43] <@SoFarFetched> unless you're banned of course
[2:07:43] <%Frost_Quill> @boomboxvillain Pat failed at brain surgery.
[2:07:45] <@SoFarFetched> you can't use it.
[2:07:46] <$joylent_blue> then it should work pvpThink
[2:07:48] <+Zulos98> @42nfl19 i think the target roll was 8 cuz it was factoring his +2 for both skill checks, normally they are factors of 5 for the target rolls
[2:07:48] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaGib huggPepsi
[2:07:50] <%RD_nx> click the character icon in the left, it shows you stats, and equipment
[2:07:51] <+Jaysky> E for everyone
[2:07:51] <+blaze__drag> I have it set to visible and I don't see any difference
[2:07:52] <Kingdudeacus> Yeah i refreshed the page and its all good
[2:07:52] <%TheLemuroid> Pat failed his first 2 rolls
[2:07:58] <ChungusQuest> It feels like all those past decades of D&D have been leading up to this point.
[2:08:06] <+b_aleph> Is the peeing extension enhanced as well?
[2:08:12] <+KingXANA> Yo, if the overlay isn't working refreshing the page helps a lot of people.
[2:08:20] <@SoFarFetched> @blaze__drag well if you have it installed,you should be able to hover over the scren now and see pat's character on the left
[2:08:25] <+KingXANA> We could hear you Pee!
[2:08:26] <+b_aleph> Pat, pee sitting down
[2:08:26] <%Frost_Quill> @blaze__drag There should be a button on the left that shows his character's face.

[2:08:50] <brexdq> how do you use the twitch extension
[2:08:50] <FeralRageGaming> braaaaaaaains
[2:08:51] <ChungusQuest> So would the Intellect Devourer basically be Morte?

[2:09:12] <SGrim> because you failed
[2:09:13] <ZilverZap> I like how immediately after you failed your options were to either leave or destroy your failure
[2:09:15] <+blaze__drag> I guess that makes some sense
[2:09:18] <%asgard147> I just realised, Pat just killed a baby Mindflayer. Someone's gonna be pissed. limesS

[2:34:42] <+Jokobeast> Stabbing. Their one weakness. How did you know? :O
[2:34:42] <%rdark_ksu> not sure if stabbing is the most useful way to use an ax but go for it
[2:34:42] <%AzureGale> They're some DBZ-ass dodges
[2:34:43] <s1rcuit> which is interesting considering axes are bad at stabbing
[2:34:43] <%Totally_Not_Toby> not sure
[2:34:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> these enemies are weak to being killed
[2:34:43] <+pectusumbra> don't let it eat your brains

[2:35:43] <ChungusQuest> That's a lot of blood for psychic damage...
[2:35:44] <+pectusumbra> those are just brainwashed people
[2:35:49] <%heartlesshealer> Does the twitch overly just not work while the streamer is in battle to prevent cheating?
[2:35:50] <%transporterthesequel> Turns out potato folk aren't exactly immune to magic.

[2:36:23] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt You hit your party member.
[2:36:23] <Blackscience91> @xir0 since it's single player probably to make it more fun to give you more options with your turn.
[2:36:26] <+Nothing_Wild> Pat bad. Lae’zal good.
[2:36:29] <Virokwet> maybe eldritch blasts dont work on the flayers factions

[2:36:57] <%secretspud> Two Khives, feels pretty nice
[2:36:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> probably because shit's on fire and flying through hell
[2:37:02] <%MonsterEnvy> More time needs to pass
[2:37:04] <%TheLemuroid> There are enemies nearby
[2:37:08] <%Frost_Quill> Pat not realizing he can hit his party members really easily is going to hurt him later.
[2:37:12] <%Barelyaudible> without proficiencies in dual wielding you'll never hiyt
[2:37:14] <+Fenris_Alexius> So I'm assuming Pat has never played DnD before?
[2:37:14] <+Jrockoni> but the short sword
[2:37:18] <twistedhands> so many teeth!
[2:37:18] <+Kawaso> Short rest is usually a full hour
[2:37:20] <$lotharrio> Pat wants a quick nap right next to these firing magic cannons, with everything around him on fire. Let him!
[2:37:22] <Equirah> you already rested in the level bellow
[2:37:33] <%Chimeraelite> "alive"
[2:37:34] <%TheLemuroid> @Fenris_Alexius Not 5e
[2:37:35] <@SoFarFetched> quick stab him
[2:37:36] <%heartlesshealer> get ready to laugh at him the first time pat picks an AoE spell

[2:37:41] <Xelhesia> CRAZY TALK
[2:37:42] <%the22cstomp> is that limmy?
[2:37:42] <ZilverZap> im a bit 'peaked' Kappa
[2:37:43] <Kiefer_Suthrland> to attack with an offhand weapon you need to attack with your main hand first
[2:37:44] <Djinnazz> or not.
[2:37:47] <+chicken_danger> kill him he's a mindflayer now
[2:37:48] <+Lunarhawk> Is he alive???
[2:37:48] <UncleAndross_> heal him?
[2:37:50] <OvaltineDream> So it's been a long ass time
[2:37:51] <%Cigwynn> Axe him
[2:37:52] <theWarwitch> cant you pickpocket thralls
[2:37:53] <+InsufficientStats> end him
[2:37:54] <digaogrunge> MERCY KILL
[2:38:00] <londorpaleale> Vancian LUL
[2:38:00] <theWarwitch> steal his shit
[2:38:03] <+Fenris_Alexius> @PatStaresAt you're out of mana
[2:38:03] <%Totally_Not_Toby> vancian slots
[2:38:03] <%heartlesshealer> You used them for the day
[2:38:05] <+KAL5000> its like mana
[2:38:06] <%Chimeraelite> that
[2:38:06] <+taren817> It means you ran out of spells, Pat
[2:38:07] <ZilverZap> have you never played dnd before pat?
[2:38:09] <Kiefer_Suthrland> you have 1
[2:38:09] <%mikessdd> just go full murder hobo. chat demands it
[2:38:11] <hawkofgp> Is this game a good game?
[2:38:12] <%aslfrasle> Warlocks get 2 spell slots per short rest.
[2:38:12] <Ipsenscastle> spellslots = MP
[2:38:13] <1matheuw> OH NO PAT DOESNT UNDERSTAND 5E
[2:38:14] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's only played DnD TWICE
[2:38:16] <+Jaysky> It means not enough spell slots.
[2:38:16] <Kiefer_Suthrland> per shot rest
[2:38:17] <+Nothing_Wild> @frost_quill Dude attacked Lae’zal upon meeting her. Then promptly died. He’s already hurting himself.
[2:38:17] <%logoth_> Seems to be a lot of resting in this game
[2:38:18] <$Afterman_> pat has no idea how dnd works i see
[2:38:19] <%TheLemuroid> As a warlock you have less spell slots but recover on short instead of long rest
[2:38:20] <%aslfrasle> 1 at level 1.
[2:38:22] <+Papafleish> I heard the game sucks ass
[2:38:24] <Salty_Eels> @heartlesshealer He's a Warlock, gets them back on short rests
[2:38:25] <Jp_DrZaius> You can Use a POTION
[2:38:32] <+blaze__drag> I mean he said earlier that the last D&D version he played was like AD&D
[2:38:33] <+Phunyun> @Papafleish no u
[2:38:34] <ZilverZap> spell slot is basically your mana
[2:38:35] <+taren817> So what kind of Warlock is Pat? Blade, Chain, Tome?
[2:38:35] <Grandma_Amari> Can't you still cast eldritch blast?
[2:38:37] <+demon1103> shh shh, its ok, just rest now *steals all his stuff*
[2:38:39] <Coystick> Delicious membrane
[2:38:40] <%Frost_Quill> I have seen that exact wall in FFXIV.
[2:38:41] <%heartlesshealer> Spontaneous spellcasters have spellslots/MP. Vancian spellcasters have to do preparations.
[2:38:41] <mr_slaide> So much mucus.
[2:38:42] <londorpaleale> @Papafleish I heard you suck ass
[2:38:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> You have to sleep for 8 hours to regain spells\
[2:38:44] <KiryujiKazamoto> yogNO
[2:38:46] <Coystick> PREY 2006?
[2:38:46] <ZilverZap> cantrips are free but level 1 spells require 1 spel lslot to use
[2:38:48] <%Frost_Quill> Not the butthole one, the mucus one.
[2:38:51] <ergulor> heal firts
[2:38:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he can cast cantrips just fine
[2:38:53] <+Pyroclase> This gives me huge XCOM Enemy Uknown vibes
[2:38:53] <%heartlesshealer> @Salty_Eels oh nice, so even shorter than usual
[2:38:54] <trianglehat> touch everything
[2:38:55] <%linSP> my favorite chamber
[2:38:56] <+Jrockoni> does he know warlocks only get 2 slots for like most of the game?
[2:38:56] <OvaltineDream> Touch all the things
[2:38:57] <beepbeepster> pat doesn't know spell slots AND playing a warlock...
[2:38:58] <Salty_Eels> @taren817 Don't get to pick until later levels
[2:39:03] <penitentpentwitch> Save
[2:39:05] <%heartlesshealer> cantrips are infinite spells
[2:39:05] <%rdark_ksu> i liked the handy haversack myself
[2:39:09] <mr_slaide> Take everything that is free.
[2:39:13] <%mike2hands> OMG FOR AMOMENT I THOUGH PAIGE WAS SCREAMING

[3:05:30] <TheChewDawg> It's not so much that you become a mind player so much that the mind flayer worm eats your brain and uses your body as raw materials to turn itself into a mind flayer. Funsies.

[3:06:32] <1matheuw> KILL THEM ALL
[3:06:34] <EsotericOdyssey> with the flayer
[3:06:34] <%ssjklyco> Are you secretly the leader of the cult?
[3:06:37] <ty2bp> mind flayer vs devils
[3:06:37] <+Kawaso> Dash
[3:06:38] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt He's a Cambion Commander
[3:06:39] <%asgard147> Pat, you can NOT beat a Mindflayer right now
[3:06:40] <+Nothing_Wild> @nipplestheenchilada96 Both.
[3:06:42] <TumbleDryer_ExhaustPipe> how long has he been playing?
[3:06:43] <TheChewDawg> Why not both?
[3:06:44] <Kiefer_Suthrland> balor?
[3:06:51] <cheapdoc> its a diet succubus, kind of a tiefling really
[3:07:00] <ChungusQuest> If that was a Balor, this fight would already be over.
[3:07:05] <%TrafficCohen> Commander Zhalk
[3:07:07] <scourgeofsun> let him die
[3:07:14] <mr_slaide> Pupper!
[3:07:15] <%TheLemuroid> you may want to move and shoot
[3:07:15] <+Nothing_Wild> @tumbledryer_exhaustpipe Awhile...
[3:07:15] <Manjove> bow is still out
[3:07:19] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a Cambion Commander. A Half Devil
[3:07:20] <%Barelyaudible> 3. hours.
[3:07:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> need to move somewhere fast? why not use your dash action, Pat!
[3:07:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> fuck that imp in particular
[3:07:32] <JaseAdrift> that demon has over 100 health
[3:07:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> psaDogchamp
[3:07:43] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can check Cambion's stats now.
[3:07:49] <Kiefer_Suthrland> dash action would use his action
[3:07:51] <+gnoame> Gief was storing that food for later
[3:07:54] <+Kduff89> Dice rolls are little dopamine roller coasters and I love them.
[3:07:57] <+pectusumbra> Man I can imagine that lady's character at an actual DnD table getting so pissed when the party members just fucking ditch her

[3:08:23] <%gespenst25> Mindflayers can kill Pat in 3. hits even if he had 100000 up because they can retain energy. 5 per hit in 2e. dunno about 5e
[3:08:28] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can check the Cambion's stats now
[3:08:31] <%TheLemuroid> Dash

[3:08:53] <EsotericOdyssey> half-devil motherfucker
[3:08:54] <%RD_nx> Cambion is a devil's chil;d
[3:08:54] <cheapdoc> half devil really
[3:08:56] <%huskarl_zap> pat
[3:08:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt He's a Half Demon
[3:08:57] <+Nothing_Wild> @pectusumbra She’d be a DM PC. You can play as her in a origin, but yeah... a lot of the shit the companions do are great as NPCs, but horrible as players.
[3:08:57] <%gespenst25> drain int I mean
[3:09:00] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> He's a fiend you racist
[3:09:00] <EsotericOdyssey> cambions are half-devils
[3:09:00] <1matheuw> half daemon
[3:09:07] <mr_slaide> They're down with the devul!
[3:09:08] <%BoxNavy> thats a big devil you put on your geocities page
[3:09:08] <silentblast93> thats satin
[3:09:08] <%huskarl_zap> pat YOURE A DEVIL
[3:09:09] <EsotericOdyssey> a bit cooler than tieflings
[3:09:09] <+Shadicara> EL DIABLO
[3:09:10] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt They're half demons like Dante and Vergil
[3:09:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Cambion is like a Tiefling with a Gold Membership to the Nine Hells
[3:09:12] <JaseAdrift> LEVEL 4 DAEMON
[3:09:12] <$lotharrio> No, Pat. Shh. There are no devils in DnD.
[3:09:18] <dizimous> @patstaresat dude, that could be like your great grandpa
[3:09:19] <%TheLemuroid> I think he had a spell scroll
[3:09:22] <Xelhesia> BUT IS HIS FAMILY CREST A DEMON OF DEATH?
[3:09:23] <%SvenHolgersson> PAT
[3:09:23] <TumbleDryer_ExhaustPipe> atpBigot
[3:09:24] <+SvenHolgersson> RACIST
[3:09:24] <%rdark_ksu> one has a crossbow
[3:09:25] <%Piemono> The other one sucks
[3:09:28] <reonome> he's trying his best
[3:09:28] <ZilverZap> The other one is a lil Pepega
[3:09:29] <%RD_nx> you just have devil blood in your lineage, he's got a devil for a daddy @PatStaresAt
[3:09:29] <EsotericOdyssey> I still liked 4th edition more than 5th
[3:09:30] <cheapdoc> one went to school, the other one bought a gun patrick
[3:09:31] <+Pyroclase> ooooh, nat10
[3:09:32] <stabbityrabbit> Cambion is a half devil. That dude is not as strong as a lot of devils.
[3:09:33] <$lotharrio> Some people are born to suck, Pat.
[3:09:34] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt One of them could be better at magic then the other
[3:09:34] <%mike2hands> he win the draw
[3:09:34] <%Chimeraelite> not all of us are talented like that
[3:09:40] <+mostbrokenrobo> i dunno, why do you shoot lasers and the lady uses a bow?
[3:09:46] <%GarbageNirvana> That is straight up Tim Curry from that one '80s fantasy movie
[3:09:49] <%skunkmandoon> [MUZAK]
[3:09:51] <%huskarl_zap> @lotharrio Youre right they're called Baatzuu
[3:09:56] <%CalderGaming> SourPls
[3:09:56] <%GarbageNirvana> What's it called
[3:09:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeye
[3:09:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice music
[3:10:01] <+Nothing_Wild> @garbagenirvana Legend.
[3:10:04] <+mostbrokenrobo> Leggend
[3:10:08] <xxmagonx> Silverhand Silverhand Silverhand
[3:10:13] <EsotericOdyssey> do they give martials more combat options in this? or are spellcasters still infinitely more interesting to play in fights?
[3:10:14] <Kiefer_Suthrland> rolled low
[3:10:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Thassa one
[3:10:17] <%ssjklyco> This is IMPossible
[3:10:20] <EsotericOdyssey> like real 5e
[3:10:21] <%AzureGale> No duh?
[3:10:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is Pat playing a Tiefling?
[3:10:31] <butthurtdave> Hey @PatStaresAt are you still doing Wasteland 3 this week, and if yes do you want any tips or tricks and junk?
[3:10:31] <%Jekado> get use to it
[3:10:32] <+Pyroclase> If that's level 1, I wanna see the level 10 spells
[3:10:34] <ergulor> Imp-losion
[3:10:35] <jorniev> IT IS ISNT IT
[3:10:36] <ChungusQuest> Do Baatezu and Tanar'ri still exist in 5e? I thought they did some...streamlining.
[3:10:36] <cheapdoc> eldritch blast is the best cantrip yes
[3:10:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Devils have resistance to mundane attacks
[3:10:36] <mr_slaide> Yop
[3:10:37] <%TheLemuroid> Tiefling Warlock
[3:10:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> level 0, technically
[3:10:42] <%Jekado> its what you'll be doing for the rest of that character
[3:10:42] <%AzureGale> Lightning bolt deals 2 damage to target enemy
[3:10:48] <+Nothing_Wild> @admiral_popnfresh Yeah, though I don’t know what kind.
[3:10:49] <+InsufficientStats> level 0 technically
[3:10:49] <%ssjklyco> sIMP
[3:10:50] <Kiefer_Suthrland> eldritch blast is the best
[3:10:51] <+Byronic_dreamer> the animation for it is fantastic
[3:10:54] <mesamus> this song slaps
[3:10:56] <+Doc_Crumbles> Cantrip, not level 1
[3:10:59] <%MonsterEnvy> Just click again
[3:11:00] <scourgeofsun> click on yourself
[3:11:01] <+eldrinos> @PatStaresAt oh boy you're gonna love the fact eldritch blast scales to your level and gets new passives...
[3:11:01] <%MisterCrimson> gotta cast it first, Pat
[3:11:01] <JaseAdrift> Eldritch blast is really cool
[3:11:04] <Macfine> you have to click on the character to active
[3:11:09] <$lotharrio> Warlocks come with a built-in plasma gun. So yeah, they're pretty good.
[3:11:18] <jorniev> IM partial to guiding bolt
[3:11:20] <%Barelyaudible> Finally!
[3:11:32] <+mostbrokenrobo> tradeoff is you get bunk for spell slots
[3:11:34] <%TheLemuroid> More imps spawned
[3:11:34] <EasternEagle21> Eldritch Blast is actually a cantrip - a level 0 spell which warlocks can cast an infinite amount of times. As they level, warlocks can improve their eldritch blast, and it ends up as powerful, if not more so, than a martial's attacks.
[3:11:39] <+gnoame> That was pretty calm for being attacked by Satan
[3:11:40] <cheapdoc> but super advanced
[3:11:40] <+SinisterBroccoli> is that a mind flayer?
[3:11:45] <butthurtdave> oh man, this music
[3:11:48] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt It's partially biological
[3:11:53] <jorniev> HELGHAST ARE JELOUS
[3:11:57] <+SinisterBroccoli> Aren't they evil hive minds?
[3:11:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Transponder? People in D&D universe know what a Transponder is?
[3:12:02] <$lotharrio> Illithids, "Nah, it's fine."
[3:12:05] <Macfine> Its pretty much all squid
[3:12:06] <%TrafficCohen> Mindflayers have one emotion, calmness
[3:12:07] <+InsufficientStats> that's their vibe, don't harsh it
[3:12:07] <+Pyroclase> Gotta love those meat computers
[3:12:08] <%rdark_ksu> nightmare bio tech
[3:12:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> biological technology is so fucking cool
[3:12:08] <%Piemono> Pat are you saying you wouldn't want to access your cell phone by having a tentacle shoved down your throat?
[3:12:08] <CursedNobleman> patron the warlock LUL
[3:12:13] <CriticKitten> Biotech is usually pretty awesome
[3:12:14] <jorniev> its mostly biological
[3:12:15] <EsotericOdyssey> @Admiral_PopnFresh mind flayers do at least
[3:12:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> It's partially hydrogenated
[3:12:18] <@SoFarFetched> that mind flayer is almost dead
[3:12:19] <LordOfThePoultry> partially?
[3:12:22] <ammobasket> partially?!
[3:12:23] <EsotericOdyssey> weird cthulhu parasite brain aliens they be
[3:12:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Does the Dead Cambion have anything on him
[3:12:35] <$lotharrio> @SinisterBroccoli No but they are ruled by a thing that SAYS it's a hive mind.
[3:12:38] <%Blackmage9999> Very Grineer Tech
[3:12:40] <jorniev> its mostly flesh and bone dude
[3:12:48] <%AzureGale> But V isn't in this game :x
[3:12:49] <%JohnAtDawn> Pat have you been Eldritch Blasting enough?
[3:12:54] <%transporterthesequel> @Admiral_PopnFresh Nah it's the brain parasite translating incoherent gibberish
[3:13:02] <butthurtdave> Yeah, and the armor penetration shit in Deadfire is just straight torture
[3:13:08] <EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt that's a fair critique of PoE. Have you tried Deadfire's turn-based mode yet?
[3:13:09] <+XIR0> switching weapons in D&D costs a full action I think, but nobody actually uses taht rule
[3:13:18] <JobbedBone> clarota D:
[3:13:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @transporterthesequel nyannHmm
[3:13:20] <CursedNobleman> 10PM honey, time for your daily eldritch blast
[3:13:21] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt you should try pathfinder kingmaker
[3:13:21] <%TheLemuroid> It's like a timer until the devil kills you
[3:13:24] <+eldrinos> fwiw pat switching weapons in normal 5e DOES cost an action, but Larian said "nobody fucking uses that rule"
[3:13:28] <%RD_nx> in one of the 5e books, mindflayers have special items that function like magic items for them, but for anyone else, it's just mundane, makes even stranger.
[3:13:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> huh interesting cuz I always found certain ones interesting when you'd find them outside their hive lotharrio
[3:13:34] <jorniev> what level is you flayer dad?
[3:13:38] <jorniev> mortarion?
[3:13:38] <Coystick> Demons don't give a fucking quarter to alien squidmen
[3:13:39] <Macfine> @XIR0 you can draw or stowe one weapon for free, per turn, it costs after that
[3:13:40] <ChungusQuest> I've always been a fan of drop&draw
[3:13:41] <%skunkmandoon> Zariel eh
[3:13:43] <londorpaleale> I'd commend their sacrifice if they weren't a hivemind.
[3:13:43] <butthurtdave> second wind is heal
[3:13:44] <cheapdoc> it gives you another attack
[3:13:50] <cheapdoc> or was it the one that healed?
[3:13:56] <Lixagon> @XIR0 droping and drawing a weapon is a free action
[3:13:58] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Pretty much you are on a timer this fight
[3:13:59] <%rarvikar> oh man, its even got the sm
[3:14:01] <1matheuw> its the heal
[3:14:01] <aretos1> heals
[3:14:01] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaGib DoritosChip DrinkPurple
[3:14:07] <aretos1> Action surge is extra action
[3:14:07] <%rarvikar> *the same sfx as DOS2
[3:14:10] <silentblast93> wait why is the deamon fighting the squid man
[3:14:13] <1matheuw> action surge gives an extra action
[3:14:18] <Kiefer_Suthrland> it heals action surge lets you attack again
[3:14:19] <jorniev> wow
[3:14:24] <aretos1> devils are fucking insane
[3:14:30] <aretos1> thats why
[3:14:31] <EsotericOdyssey> so is Larian giving martial classes actual options in fights? or are casters still objectively superior?
[3:14:37] <+Lunarhawk> dash!
[3:14:46] <rekinom> What happens if you just let the mindflayer die ?
[3:14:47] <+ApocalypticExpress> Grinding FFXIV, Almost got all initial classes to 50 and then I can finally continue ARR MSQ
[3:14:48] <+pectusumbra> @silentblast93 everyone hates mindflayers and devils hate everything, especially people fucking breaking INTO hell
[3:14:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Fun fact every imp you kill her is permanently dead. As Devils don't respawn in Hell if they are killed in Hell
[3:14:55] <%TheLemuroid> Pat just keep praising dnd 5e
[3:14:55] <%AzureGale> What a great
[3:14:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this 3D movement system looks like it feels great
[3:14:58] <Them00n> Pat is a fan of 5e.
[3:14:58] <octavio_c0ut0_s> you can use your action to move up to your speed
[3:15:01] <%Jeemukun> 5E does some pretty nifty stuff
[3:15:03] <Macfine> A Devil, Ilithid, Gith/Redragon three way battle is a pretty great start
[3:15:04] <+eldrinos> @EsotericOdyssey i mean one of the fighter subclasses for this build is Battlemaster
[3:15:05] <%linSP> i bet that devil man has great loot tho
[3:15:06] <JaseAdrift> Welcome to 5e
[3:15:07] <jorniev> EEEEEEW
[3:15:07] <+Pyroclase> oh a dragon
[3:15:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bio-wires
[3:15:16] <jorniev> HI
[3:15:16] <cherrycottontail> Dash isn't normally a bonus action
[3:15:19] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> yeah 5e is pretty sick
[3:15:20] <%SirGO0SE> this game big awesome so far
[3:15:22] <%skunkmandoon> [Effects not done yet]
[3:15:23] <cherrycottontail> They are kinda cheating
[3:15:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WHA
[3:15:27] <+Kduff89> thats a dragon ass dragon
[3:15:28] <%BoxNavy> a big pupoff
[3:15:28] <NocturnalRites> oh shit a red dragon
[3:15:29] <+silvery_cricket> pop off more like pop out
[3:15:29] <Kiefer_Suthrland> that fire was bad
[3:15:30] <+Lunarhawk> That could use a graphical touchup
[3:15:30] <1matheuw> uhhh
[3:15:30] <CursedNobleman> just like one of my japanese animes
[3:15:31] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WHERE
[3:15:34] <%linSP> FLOAT
[3:15:37] <%maenos2> what the fuck did i just tune in to
[3:15:38] <+XIR0> @Macfine @Lixagon Yes, doing one of those things in one turn is a free action, but then doing the second would be a full action
[3:15:39] <1matheuw> that effect is kinda weird
[3:15:39] <%Puhff> oooh that was some Early Access fire
[3:15:40] <+itsgundamu> WOW THAT LOOKED BAT
[3:15:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ????\
[3:15:40] <Zourath> @SinisterBroccoli Mind Flayers are literally time travellers. It's why they absolutely terrify Aboleths, they have a racial memory going back to the first Aboleths, and yet Illithids just showed up one day.
[3:15:41] <ChungusQuest> Astral travel!
[3:15:41] <+mostbrokenrobo> animation's a little jank...
[3:15:42] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> dash usually replaces your action
[3:15:42] <+pectusumbra> yeah that's just a red dragon. It's just a three way party of EVIL powerful creatures out for your ass
[3:15:44] <%Jeemukun> oh hey, out of hell
[3:15:48] <+silvery_cricket> THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER SEND THE TIEFLING
[3:15:50] <jorniev> ITS THE STEERING WHEEL
[3:15:51] <+gutlesscoward> eh, it's a big setpiece thing for the start of the game
[3:15:52] <GunEden> i can see the early access
[3:15:56] <%machshop> grab the.....thing
[3:15:58] <%rdark_ksu> the fart dimension
[3:16:01] <cheapdoc> anywhere but there
[3:16:05] <%maskofmichael> Where did you come from? Cotton Eye Joe?
[3:16:05] <jorniev> looked jany
[3:16:05] <+sp_abadidea> A warlock would have never succeeded that Athletics check
[3:16:08] <koffeemancer> Oh look its the lady you didnt save
[3:16:08] <jorniev> janky
[3:16:10] <+Jrockoni> failed athletics check
[3:16:10] <prime_name> Hey it's that lady
[3:16:13] <+eldrinos> ^
[3:16:14] <Coystick> Tentacle Rape is the control method
[3:16:15] <+GundamF91> That was very jank
[3:16:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I do like that Patron's horns are like an Eland or Kudu antelope, that rocks
[3:16:23] <EsotericOdyssey> @eldrinos but what if you aren't a battlemaster or eldritch knight? do you just get to swing your sword and nothing else besides the basic actions (shove, dash, etc.)?

[3:32:31] <jorniev> clerics got buffed
[3:32:32] <%NopeBadguy> she's an actual caster
[3:32:34] <$lotharrio> Was one of those bonfire?
[3:32:34] <+AgniBrandt> Warlocks get VERY few spells
[3:32:34] <%saadi90> Still not as bad as Fallout 76
[3:32:35] <%Jekado> yeah shes a mainline caster type
[3:32:36] <ty2bp> not a warlock
[3:32:37] <%asgard147> is that Zangief?
[3:32:38] <+silvery_cricket> Well ulike a warlock a cleric is usefull so they need the spells
[3:32:38] <%BoxNavy> is it just a weird word for magic
[3:32:39] <1matheuw> ON LVL1 clerics are busted
[3:32:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> zangief does a big snore
[3:32:39] <+Ragnakawaii> Clerics are full casters so they get lots
[3:32:40] <$lotharrio> Guidance is great.
[3:32:42] <%maenos2> man by the end of my campaign as a warlock i had like, a dozen cantrips
[3:32:42] <+TheBigO75> CREATE WATER!! Broken spell go!
[3:32:43] <+Draegen86> Hi Warlock, see what a REAL SPELLCASTER LOOKS LIKE
[3:32:45] <NocturnalRites> that's what you get for playing warlock
[3:32:45] <somanynames234> cleric busted like in dnd?
[3:32:48] <%linSP> yo bucciarati lookin good in this
[3:32:49] <%Broand> Ooh create water
[3:32:49] <%aslfrasle> She's a full caster Pat, instead of a half-caster like you.
[3:32:50] <@SoFarFetched> @asgard147 yeah he a snoring baby
[3:32:51] <KiryujiKazamoto> got em
[3:32:54] <stabbityrabbit> Ooof, Trickster is not ideal for a domain.
[3:32:54] <ty2bp> warlocks are bitch tier
[3:32:55] <+thickshield> and here we see a warlock encountering a real spellcaster
[3:32:59] <%NopeBadguy> can trip on this idck
[3:33:00] <LordOfThePoultry> BOOOOOOOOOO
[3:33:00] <+BringBackSempai> she puts the can in cantrip
[3:33:01] <%maenos2> @Draegen86 yeah but can they do this? *spams eldritch blast*
[3:33:01] <%Frost_Quill> CREATO WATER
[3:33:02] <%transporterthesequel> So far both characters can just beat the game without you. Fighter+Cleric who cares what else
[3:33:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> clerics can also hit like trucks. they're awesome
[3:33:07] <JaseAdrift> Oh man he took create water
[3:33:08] <%vaporousTippler> What cleric doesn't take cure wounds?
[3:33:08] <+pectusumbra> looks like a cleric. Full casters gets lots of stuff. Warlocks get a lot less, but warlock gets lots of extras while also being fucking COOL
[3:33:08] <arkv01> madam I need the shoe polish for deez nuts
[3:33:13] <+AgniBrandt> Basically every other spellcaster will have WAY more spells of all levels than you. But they only get them back on a long rest!
[3:33:15] <londorpaleale> have her roll her +3 animal handling to quell zangief's boner
[3:33:17] <EasternEagle21> Warlocks are full casters
[3:33:20] <Manwad> i hope you can do bless sheleighleigh smite shenanigans in this

[3:37:09] <wraithtaker162> never underestimate a good guilding bolt
[3:37:12] <+blond_e> @PatStaresAt I know nothing about this game. is it a DnD-type game?

[3:37:52] <%maenos2> you only NOW noticed it?!
[3:37:54] <+sp_abadidea> Pat's becoming a true warlock; using Eldritch Blast to solve *everything*
[3:37:55] <wraithtaker162> Does this game have as much nonsensical customization of Eldritch Blast as actual 5e?
[3:38:04] <ty2bp> be a wizard and take knock as a spell
[3:38:04] <somanynames234> can you just pick up sand and throw it at people
[3:38:04] <reonome> she got an attitude
[3:38:06] <+smevvster> How's the game? I've heard less than impressive things about it right now
[3:38:08] <Coystick> Hello yes, can I get one large map with extra map?
[3:38:08] <+TheBigO75> Not all clerics NEED to be healers, but everyone who isn't tends not to last long lmao

[3:38:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Affter the character creator I wouldn't be surprised
[3:38:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what was class? Cleric?
[3:38:33] <+silvery_cricket> Well Tempest Clerics dont have to be healers
[3:38:38] <cheapdoc> You sleep
[3:38:40] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a button above short rest
[3:38:44] <thetntm> hey pat, how are you enjoying the game so far? I've heard some bad things
[3:38:44] <%MisterCrimson> Camp button on the side of the mini map
[3:38:46] <+Pyroclase> I'm going to assume there's some sort of camping mechanic
[3:38:46] <cheapdoc> you'll probably need to find a bed
[3:38:49] <+sp_abadidea> BRAIN DOGGO
[3:38:50] <Jathspuh> WOOLOOLOOLOO

[3:38:57] <cheapdoc> well, fuck me
[3:38:57] <%Jekado> why you don't lead with your caster
[3:38:58] <+Taglog7> Devour Hour
[3:38:59] <%RD_nx> save often, when this game was first showed it was here, and the dude rolled bad and died right here.
[3:39:01] <%NopeBadguy> lemme smash
[3:39:02] <ty2bp> war clerics don't do much healing in my experience
[3:39:03] <%NopeBadguy> pls
[3:39:04] <somanynames234> take a nap on the burning floor during combat to long rest
[3:39:06] <1matheuw> shadowheart smash
[3:39:07] <+Pyroclase> oh my god I just noticed how many minimap buttons there are
[3:39:09] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Long Rest is the button above short rest
[3:39:11] <jorniev> 3 OF THEM
[3:39:12] <+silvery_cricket> Watch out before it teleports into your brain
[3:39:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoUnga Beccy let smash UGH
[3:39:19] <SulfurousAcid> lemme smash
[3:39:21] <wraithtaker162> they're both casters
[3:39:28] <%MonsterEnvy> You can swap characters in chat
[3:39:35] <%MonsterEnvy> There is a button for it
[3:39:39] <+moustascheman> use shield of faith for extra AC
[3:39:45] <jorniev> yeah but clerics do push ups
[3:39:51] <BaronVonProlix> yeah it sucked ass its a cantrip
[3:39:54] <+pectusumbra> Yeah I don't know that I would long rest too many times if you can help it
[3:39:54] <butthurtdave> and down goes the caster
[3:39:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its best against demonic, probably
[3:39:59] <somanynames234> unfortunate
[3:40:00] <jestrfestr> time to die
[3:40:03] <+BringBackSempai> lol GG right here
[3:40:05] <wraithtaker162> They might do push ups, but that doesn't give them any more hit dice
[3:40:05] <%TheLemuroid> She is a better frontliner than your warlock
[3:40:05] <%Jekado> @wraithtaker162 but a cleric is much more tankier
[3:40:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Becky, you SUCK
[3:40:11] <+TheBigO75> Yay even in video games, sacred flame is ass.
[3:40:15] <$lotharrio> You should really keep your warlock more than a bit behind anyone who is supposed to be a melee guy.
[3:40:15] <+BringBackSempai> hope you saved recently
[3:40:19] <aretos1> JUST DISENGAGE
[3:40:20] <NocturnalRites> ooo intellect devourers
[3:40:21] <Them00n> The game takes off the training gloves after this.
[3:40:22] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Her healing word is a bonus action if you want to heal
[3:40:23] <somanynames234> is pat immediately going to die
[3:40:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> sacred flame gets better as you level I think
[3:40:33] <BaronVonProlix> yeah mindflayer stuff is not joke

[3:46:55] <KiryujiKazamoto> funny number times
[3:46:58] <Goodvibes99508> story based not number based?
[3:47:00] <somanynames234> it's because he has brain babies and we're trying to make them pop
[3:47:01] <%Jekado> is pat roleplaying as me?
[3:47:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> 1head
[3:47:07] <cheapdoc> 69 times
[3:47:09] <thetruenicster> For Sure It Is Gonna Happen This Time
[3:47:12] <%Piemen99> BOOOOOOO
[3:47:12] <jorniev> EARLY ACCES
[3:47:12] <datpineappleguy> world is a fuck
[3:47:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I would support an rpg game entirely voiced by Pat.
[3:47:16] <+It_sjustjoey> Sleepy sleepy
[3:47:16] <mostundesired> Try it again.
[3:47:17] <+Pyroclase> If you sleep 14 times and place the red gemstone on the third rock from the left you unlock the secret ending
[3:47:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> Imagine if it did?
[3:47:18] <BaronVonProlix> this is the character who writes "NARCOLEPSY" in the "flaws" bracket
[3:47:20] <+jjacksterup> didnt you roll to get it out of ur head?
[3:47:21] <scourgeofsun> There should be some consequences?
[3:47:22] <tubit> check again to be sure
[3:47:22] <penitentpentwitch> "Speed of Plot"
[3:47:23] <+Ominnous> -die of old age-
[3:47:23] <+Shadicara> Sleepy time doesn't count as real time god guys
[3:47:24] <JaseAdrift> Long rests are for healing the party and getting spells back
[3:47:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Patron you playin Devil game
[3:47:24] <$lotharrio> Keep rolling them dice.
[3:47:25] <1matheuw> so the tadpole is a nothing then?
[3:47:26] <somanynames234> I don't think it does shit
[3:47:27] <Manwad> good RP
[3:47:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Depression mode
[3:47:29] <+gutlesscoward> laaaaaame
[3:47:30] <%vaderxyz1970> BOO they need to fix that
[3:47:30] <KiryujiKazamoto> sense of urgency SHATTERED
[3:47:33] <somanynames234> it's plot time
[3:47:34] <%linSP> its gonna happen any day now
[3:47:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Maybe in the full game
[3:47:36] <%TheLemuroid> hmm takes a bit of the bite out of it but they do want to do some narrative things with it
[3:47:41] <%coreyyotto> It IS early access
[3:47:43] <Them00n> Does it autosave after a long rest?
[3:47:44] <penitentpentwitch> Perhaps on a harder difficulty?
[3:47:44] <LunarRemix> It's probably a thing in the full game
[3:47:45] <+esdiorguthre> :(
[3:47:48] <%ChestMimik> "And then Pat slept for fourty days and fourty nights, and the DM was REALLY confused"
[3:47:48] <+Pyroclase> I've never seen an RPG with an actual time limit, aside from maybe Fallout?
[3:47:48] <T_Sasquatch> PogChamp depression sleep
[3:47:51] <raikagelord1> So can someone tell me why being a mindflayer is a bad thing? They seem bad ass.
[3:47:56] <%Piemen99> 0/10
[3:47:57] <%linSP> i mean it would suck if you suddenly lost the game halfway in
[3:47:57] <mostundesired> Mash it more.
[3:48:07] <%Ne1son> 1 hour vs 8 hours
[3:48:08] <cheapdoc> did he load?
[3:48:09] <+silvery_cricket> Pat its not OPTIMAL to do that
[3:48:09] <+sp_abadidea> who needs a healer when we have LONG REST
[3:48:09] <DXLelouch24> your probably gonna gain Mindflayer powers and become a hyrbid anyways, we can all see it coming
[3:48:10] <+Exicuren> At least the DM let us long rest
[3:48:18] <$Caped_Eggy> The game is jankier than expected
[3:48:20] <+blaze__drag> they could make it a toggle on a harder difficulty
[3:48:21] <$lotharrio> @raikagelord1 It kills you. The mindflayer is the one in your body.
[3:48:24] <+blaze__drag> like fallout's survival mode and such
[3:48:24] <prime_name> @raikagelord1 Loss of individuality and you eat brains forever
[3:48:25] <somanynames234> long rest after every battle
[3:48:25] <1matheuw> @raikagelord1 the mindflayer eats your brain and then uses your body
[3:48:27] <+GenesisKnight> HEX
[3:48:29] <tonfirean> I guess the mindflayer parasite just takes over your body, like you're not "you" anymore after that.
[3:48:30] <BaronVonProlix> @raikagelord1 you live in a smelly brain cave all day and literally every other living being in all the realms hates you existance
[3:48:36] <butthurtdave> Might wanna position your caster up on that ridge of tentacle bullshit
[3:48:37] <+silvery_cricket> QUICK PAT USE YOUR 1 SPELL
[3:48:40] <+Ominnous> these things patiently waited 8 days to attack you
[3:48:40] <+Nothing_Wild> @raikagelord1 It’s not you. It also destroys your soul.
[3:48:42] <%MisterCrimson> @raikagelord1 because they're evil assholes, and the tadpole just takes your body, it's not you
[3:48:49] <%MonsterEnvy> Why not climb higher before shooting
[3:48:53] <+Shadicara> Can you not light her mace on fire Kappa
[3:48:55] <jorniev> TROW YOUR SHOES!
[3:48:58] <+sp_abadidea> hiding is a bonus action for all classes? NONSENSE
[3:48:58] <Manwad> wait anyone can hide as a bonus action? What can rogues do then?
[3:49:03] <xlander27> I just got here and there's fucking brains crawling on the floor, wtf
[3:49:04] <Zombrocom> Mind flayers work like the xenomorph from aliens
[3:49:05] <mostundesired> DIP
[3:49:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> yes
[3:49:07] <%MonsterEnvy> THe platform right next to you
[3:49:08] <+sirsammalot> you lose your conciousness and control of your body when you become a mind player. A passenger in your own body.
[3:49:09] <%TheLemuroid> You can jump up on things perhaps
[3:49:10] <+pectusumbra> @raikagelord1 yeah, *you* don't get to be a mind flayer, your brain gets eaten by a bug and your body becomes part of an evil alien hive mind
[3:49:12] <Decarcassor> Its more like a Minflayer consume you from inside out. You don't remain yourself.
[3:49:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaDab
[3:49:16] <tonfirean> Is dip a bonus action?
[3:49:20] <+Exicuren> Here we go baby
[3:49:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think that high points extended range in divinity
[3:49:27] <+Shadicara> Oh you can actually light it on fire PogChamp
[3:49:28] <$Caped_Eggy> She ded
[3:49:29] <GeneralHysterics> that's out of order. FIRST you smash, THEN you dip
[3:49:30] <mostundesired> Yeyeyeye
[3:49:35] <$Caped_Eggy> Dman
[3:49:35] <1matheuw> ye
[3:49:36] <+blaze__drag> +2 AC
[3:49:36] <+mostbrokenrobo> yeah
[3:49:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Your AC increases by 2
[3:49:37] <cheapdoc> yeah, its +2 ac
[3:49:37] <%MisterCrimson> Shield is more AC, yes
[3:49:37] <+sp_abadidea> shields increase AC, yep
[3:49:38] <mr_slaide> Yop
[3:49:39] <mostundesired> Yeah, it increases your AC my dude.
[3:49:39] <%aslfrasle> Shields increase AC by 2
[3:49:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> AC is if you get hit
[3:49:40] <Manwad> yeah
[3:49:40] <+silvery_cricket> Shield is +5 to your AC
[3:49:40] <+shabop> yes
[3:49:41] <jorniev> armor class
[3:49:42] <Them00n> +2 AC
[3:49:42] <Wisepheonix> yep
[3:49:43] <NeonNobleKalzeria> increases AC by 2
[3:49:43] <%Chimeraelite> +1 or 2 ac yea
[3:49:43] <KiryujiKazamoto> why cant we just pick up our brain, and move it someplace else?
[3:49:47] <OvaltineDream> Ups AC right
[3:49:47] <+Pyroclase> Strange, but it makes sense mechanically
[3:49:48] <raikagelord1> Ahhhh I thought you became a mindflayer and not they become you. That SUCKS balls get the Yucky tadpole our of you.
[3:49:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> whether shield or dodge
[3:49:51] <1matheuw> miss is the wrong term its actually defend or dodge
[3:49:52] <+TheBigO75> AC baby
[3:49:54] <%gespenst25> that's... what ac is
[3:49:54] <+mostbrokenrobo> thematically they tank it, but yes
[3:49:55] <stabbityrabbit> Yes. Shields should give +2 AC in 5e.
[3:49:56] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[3:49:56] <+Shadicara> Now just roll 20 again
[3:49:58] <Goodvibes99508> harder to hit not more likely to miss
[3:50:00] <$lotharrio> Yeah about a 10% miss chance.
[3:50:07] <%Falilth> wait i walked away are we still on that brain ship?
[3:50:08] <tubit> woot
[3:50:08] <mostundesired> So anyway, I started Blasting: The Class
[3:50:09] <GeneralHysterics> Big ol kamehameha
[3:50:10] <%vaporousTippler> She has 1 more AC than you do.
[3:50:13] <BaronVonProlix> also the tadpole wiggles inside your head via your eyeball
[3:50:17] <butthurtdave> BECKY SMASH
[3:50:17] <%MonsterEnvy> And a level up one you finish the fight
[3:50:27] <+pectusumbra> 95% is as good as it will ever get, and nice, level!
[3:50:28] <%TheLemuroid> Bonk or sacred flame
[3:50:30] <$lotharrio> Bonfire!
[3:50:34] <tonfirean> I tuned out for a bit, what happened to troll gal and where did pod gal come from (other than the pod)?
[3:50:34] <+pectusumbra> For a warlock that's your first invocation!
[3:50:36] <ty2bp> shield of faith is + 2 regular shield spell is plus 5 for a turn
[3:50:38] <+Shadicara> Smash him
[3:50:40] <%TheLemuroid> Or shield of faith
[3:50:45] <Manwad> sacred flame's an enemy dex save, be aware
[3:50:48] <cheapdoc> healing word IS THE SHIT
[3:50:53] <jorniev> when they showed this game for the first time , the dev that was playing it got SHAFTED at this part.
[3:50:57] <+xemnahort> Do I need to play first 2 games first?
[3:50:58] <DashXero> Oh goddammit. I forgot about those little quadruped brain things!
[3:51:06] <DashXero> They're creepy as heck.
[3:51:11] <GeneralHysterics> which edition of D&D is this based on? I'm seeing some 5e stuff in there.
[3:51:12] <1matheuw> do an attack of opportunity
[3:51:17] <KiryujiKazamoto> i for one welcome our brain slug overlords
[3:51:19] <+pectusumbra> @tonfirean Pat tried to pilot the ship and it crashed on a beach somewhere, now its spreading goo everywhere
[3:51:22] <+GenesisKnight> level up

[3:51:41] <mr_slaide> Nah, he dipped his weapon in fire.

[3:51:46] <+Shadicara> Both
[3:51:48] <%vaporousTippler> Dogs kinda just vocalize with growls.
[3:51:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> Growling is awake snoring
[3:51:50] <1matheuw> @KiryujiKazamoto found the thrall
[3:51:52] <+FierceDeityGabe> They can do both
[3:51:53] <Jathspuh> mic gief up
[3:51:53] <tonfirean> And the party shuffling was just part of the crash, people got separated and reunited and junk?

[3:52:16] <%Mr_Pylon> Shar? Uh oh
[3:52:17] <+Exicuren> Now we need to throw water to the fire to create vapor and then electrify that vapor
[3:52:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> Char like from Gundam?
[3:52:18] <%shurtal> Char? is she gonna drop a colony?
[3:52:20] <%gespenst25> God of LIES
[3:52:20] <+senfood> I'd Shar her deity, if you know what I mean.
[3:52:21] <+pectusumbra> trickery, called it

[3:52:52] <$Mothman742> chat titties and ass or cultured abs and thighs
[3:52:52] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt per long rest as well
[3:52:53] <+D00msDayDan> nature's beauty!
[3:52:54] <GeneralHysterics> don't clerics know all their spells?
[3:52:55] <cheapdoc> it should be on long rest
[3:52:55] <%maenos2> eh...i can think of a few ways it can backfire
[3:52:57] <+mostbrokenrobo> "Turn" as in make them "Turn" around
[3:52:58] <$lotharrio> On long rest probably?
[3:53:01] <%TheLemuroid> Spells can be swapped at Long Rest
[3:53:01] <cheapdoc> if according to the game
[3:53:02] <1matheuw> i think you cant do it in long rest
[3:53:02] <%aslfrasle> Clerics can change prepared spells every long rest.
[3:53:03] <+Shadicara> Does a brain count as an undead?
[3:53:03] <%huskarl_zap> PALADIN ID LIKE TO REPORT A EDGELORD SPOTTING
[3:53:03] <%Ne1son> No
[3:53:06] <+pectusumbra> should be on long rest
[3:53:06] <1matheuw> can*
[3:53:07] <KiryujiKazamoto> just ass
[3:53:08] <%Calek> Pat's gonna nut when he sees Agonizing Blast
[3:53:09] <mihokspawn> Clerics are long rest
[3:53:10] <butthurtdave> BLESS UP
[3:53:10] <%shootbang_exe> nah you can swap equipped spells whenever
[3:53:10] <Manwad> BLESS
[3:53:12] <+Kyma1020> No
[3:53:13] <$lotharrio> Bless is great.
[3:53:15] <Wisepheonix> you can prepare spells on long rest
[3:53:16] <Darren716> #bless
[3:53:16] <%TheLemuroid> Healing is Bonus Action
[3:53:17] <Them00n> Bless got nerfed in 5e
[3:53:18] <%vaporousTippler> Cure wounds is on touch. Word is ranged.
[3:53:20] <%aslfrasle> Cure wounds is a full action.
[3:53:20] <+InsufficientStats> clerics should be able to switch easily, warlocks not so much
[3:53:21] <ty2bp> No wonder her ac sucks no dex
[3:53:21] <$lotharrio> Bless and Guidance are fantastic spells.
[3:53:22] <%TheLemuroid> Cure is Action
[3:53:29] <wraithtaker162> Should be able to prepare spells once per long rest, otherwise casters are gonna have a Rough time
[3:53:31] <%gespenst25> no clerics know all their spells and prepare a list of known ones each day, then cast using spell slots
[3:53:32] <ty2bp> And not great armor
[3:53:33] <Jathspuh> PepeHands
[3:53:34] <%Calek> Bless is still good though
[3:53:36] <%Ne1son> Touch vs range
[3:53:37] <+GrandmasterBFunk> so is the combat based on 5E?
[3:53:38] <aretos1> cure wounds is a trap
[3:53:39] <Wisepheonix> bless is really fucking good tho
[3:53:40] <+GenesisKnight> Inflict Wounds is good
[3:53:42] <+pectusumbra> cure wounds is touch, healing word is ranged
[3:53:44] <%Allenora> Hi
[3:53:46] <cheapdoc> Cure wounds is an action and short distance. Healing word is long distance but less healing
[3:53:54] <Manwad> bless is still great
[3:53:58] <+SinisterBroccoli> is this game co op at all?
[3:54:02] <%MisterCrimson> free flanking
[3:54:07] <MrMatternot> Mirror image?
[3:54:08] <%Allenora> Is it 5e rules or it's own rules?
[3:54:08] <JaseAdrift> Bless is really good
[3:54:15] <xanderfist> is this game fully released?
[3:54:17] <%MonsterEnvy> Time to level your guy

[3:54:20] <cherrycottontail> it's mostly 5e
[3:54:21] <%MonsterEnvy> It's 5e rules
[3:54:25] <Them00n> Did you level up the warlock?
[3:54:30] <%Allenora> Thank you
[3:54:30] <cheapdoc> seems to be a bit of both @Allenora
[3:54:44] <+pectusumbra> Game is Early access, 5e ruleset with some modification so far it seems
[3:54:46] <Big_Dream> Bless is 1d4 extra on attack roolls and saves
[3:54:47] <DashXero> Did that tiefling just dab?
[3:54:47] <aretos1> levelyourself up
[3:54:54] <KiryujiKazamoto> i can't spell
[3:54:57] <%Allenora> I learned D&D with 5e rules so that would be awesome to me
[3:54:58] <aretos1> you get the best warlock feature now
[3:55:02] <BaronVonProlix> hes a tiefling of course he dabbed
[3:55:06] <pfctwinkletoes> How does the game look thus far?
[3:55:07] <cheapdoc> does he have a level on himself?
[3:55:16] <+xemnahort> When’s the full release
[3:55:22] <%TheLemuroid> Overlay hasn't updated her HP
[3:55:26] <cheapdoc> he does
[3:55:27] <+Nothing_Wild> @pfctwinkletoes Good, but Pat’s really slow.

[3:55:51] <%PhysicsLB> ELDRITCH BLAST

[3:56:17] <cheapdoc> CHECK ALL OF YOUR SHIT
[3:56:18] <%Ne1son> Invocations PAT
[3:56:19] <wraithtaker162> wait, armor of agathys is so good tho

[3:56:19] <+InsufficientStats> ag blast baby
[3:56:24] <Wisepheonix> oh shit your invocations
[3:56:24] <%maenos2> pat eldritch blast gets a LOT of invocations
[3:56:26] <bearking05> the list
[3:56:31] <stabbityrabbit> I'm glad they say agonizing blast is what you want.
[3:56:33] <+esdiorguthre> above spells
[3:56:34] <aretos1> invocations are the only reason to play warlock
[3:56:39] <$lotharrio> Agonizing Blast is a good one.
[3:56:42] <+FatherGreyBeard> Agonizing Blast, aka required
[3:56:43] <Decarcassor> Always Agonizing Blast.
[3:56:52] <juicifrost> man for a second i really thought we were back at character creation
[3:56:52] <+AgniBrandt> Devil Sight is great
[3:56:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> When ya moms say we got Thanos at home
[3:56:54] <+mostbrokenrobo> Repelling too
[3:56:55] <datpineappleguy> Hellish Rebuke!
[3:56:55] <GeneralHysterics> nice
[3:56:56] <Goodvibes99508> repelling blast
[3:56:57] <+pectusumbra> oh, they give you 2 to star
[3:56:57] <Mojomoud> The best Invocations are the ones that upgrade Eldtirch Balast
[3:56:58] <%Ne1son> Always and forever
[3:56:59] <%SirGO0SE> I'll show you an Agonizing Blast :) brap
[3:57:01] <+FatherGreyBeard> Devil's Sight is great
[3:57:02] <harrfuzz> And so I started Eldritch Blasting
[3:57:03] <+AgniBrandt> Devil sight lets you see through MAGIC darkness
[3:57:03] <$lotharrio> Mage armor at will is pretty good right now.
[3:57:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> When ya mom say we got Nightcrawler At home
[3:57:07] <%Calek> your AC would go up by 2 if you pick Armour of Shadows, but you have to run around naked
[3:57:09] <%gespenst25> at will? PogChamp
[3:57:11] <$lotharrio> Repelling blast might be good too.
[3:57:12] <ty2bp> Get armor of shawdows
[3:57:12] <+GenesisKnight> Gives you extra HP
[3:57:13] <+JVolfram> More like Dork Vision
[3:57:13] <THELava_lad> I wonder if you can learn foolish mockery?
[3:57:14] <Them00n> False life is great
[3:57:15] <+mostbrokenrobo> free temp hp
[3:57:15] <mikevens7> repelling blast
[3:57:16] <%Nekros4442> +5 hp
[3:57:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> temporary HP
[3:57:17] <+AgniBrandt> Devil's Sight is WAAAAY Better than dark vision
[3:57:17] <AMaidIndeed> temp hp
[3:57:17] <+HellCopter> Temporary hit points
[3:57:17] <%MonsterEnvy> False lIfe gives you temp hp
[3:57:17] <cheapdoc> temporary hit points
[3:57:17] <Mojomoud> Devil's Sight lets you see though Darkness made by magic
[3:57:18] <+mgskomododragon> Temporary HP
[3:57:18] <%snow_bush> Temp HP
[3:57:18] <wraithtaker162> oh shit, mask of many faces
[3:57:19] <KiryujiKazamoto> my life :)
[3:57:19] <stabbityrabbit> A trap. Don't worry about it.
[3:57:20] <Them00n> Temporary hp buff
[3:57:20] <$lotharrio> False Life is a temporary HP spell.
[3:57:20] <%maskofmichael> Life that is false
[3:57:21] <londorpaleale> False Life give temp HP
[3:57:22] <wraithtaker162> just go full Fjord
[3:57:22] <%aslfrasle> Devil's Sight includes magical darkness, which darkvision doesn't
[3:57:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> temp hp
[3:57:22] <+gustavozxd> untrue vita
[3:57:23] <+FatherGreyBeard> Dark Vision isn't perfect sight you still have disadvantage
[3:57:23] <+skeletonmilk> Armor of Shadows and Repelling Blast are both based.
[3:57:23] <Bluewolf544> @patstaresat Magic dsrkness vision is different pat
[3:57:24] <+pectusumbra> it's free temp HP
[3:57:25] <BaronVonProlix> buffer HP
[3:57:26] <Wundae> Yo wheres that Darkness+devils sight combo tho
[3:57:26] <cherrycottontail> garbage
[3:57:28] <1matheuw> mage armor at will seems pretty busted
[3:57:29] <Decarcassor> False Life is Temporart HP. It does not stack ever.
[3:57:31] <danielm427> sjit
[3:57:32] <+TheBigO75> grey health
[3:57:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> REPELLING BLAST IS THE SHIT
[3:57:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> Its a disposable Item
[3:57:37] <butthurtdave> oh shit do those blast things stack?
[3:57:37] <aretos1> repelling is fun
[3:57:38] <jorniev> KEEP AWAY
[3:57:38] <+archangel9889> did he restart?
[3:57:41] <TheHeroAppears> big blast
[3:57:41] <scrublordsamurai> whats up fuckface!
[3:57:42] <%SvenHolgersson> It's my life
[3:57:43] <+GenesisKnight> Armor of Shadows and Agonizing are the way to go
[3:57:44] <%maenos2> eh...
[3:57:45] <BaronVonProlix> doesnt false life slowly tick down as well?
[3:57:45] <aretos1> spell slot ones suck
[3:57:45] <KiryujiKazamoto> cast backbreaker
[3:57:46] <Them00n> False life good
[3:57:48] <%aslfrasle> Mage Armor is a good choice.
[3:57:48] <danielm427> mask
[3:57:50] <Manwad> you can kite like a motherfucker with repelling blast
[3:57:50] <%TheLemuroid> Mask of Many Faces might be fun
[3:57:51] <%Nekros4442> Buff up Eldritch Blast imo
[3:57:52] <+pectusumbra> ehhhhh
[3:57:53] <Mr_Rakjo> @archangel9889 he leveled up
[3:57:54] <Goodvibes99508> repelling blast has no size requirement or saving throw
[3:57:57] <zac_nap94> devils sight is also magical darkness
[3:57:58] <%Puhff> Agonizing and Repelling, do it
[3:57:58] <MrNoobMcSalt> Eldritch GUN
[3:58:01] <%Ne1son> The Blasts should stack at higher levels btw
[3:58:04] <Decarcassor> Armour of Shadows suck
[3:58:06] <1matheuw> mage armor every combat WOOO
[3:58:06] <ChungusQuest> BIG COMBAT
[3:58:07] <jorniev> DOES NOT STACK
[3:58:07] <$lotharrio> Armor of Shadows is like getting free medium armor.
[3:58:09] <butthurtdave> 2 AC
[3:58:11] <mikevens7> mage armor doesn't work with armor you're wearing
[3:58:11] <AMaidIndeed> 13+dex mod ac
[3:58:11] <KiryujiKazamoto> just know it 4Head
[3:58:12] <Decarcassor> You don't need mage armor as a Warlock
[3:58:13] <lord_sykos> Mage Armor
[3:58:14] <Wisepheonix> mage armor is 13 + dex
[3:58:15] <Manwad> oh man does anyone know if you can pact of blade it up in this?
[3:58:15] <londorpaleale> mage armor is just like +2 to AC?
[3:58:15] <aretos1> mage armor at will
[3:58:15] <%Piemen99> +2 armor
[3:58:15] <%Rafferty3231> Beast Speech!
[3:58:15] <cherrycottontail> mage armor is +3 ac
[3:58:16] <%TheLemuroid> It acts like 13 AC if naked
[3:58:16] <%MooseIsGoose> it gives you bas ac of 13
[3:58:17] <+GenesisKnight> Casts mage armor. 13+Dex for AC
[3:58:17] <stabbityrabbit> Armour of Shadows makes your AC higher.
[3:58:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> Eldritch Shoot a Bitch
[3:58:20] <lord_sykos> makes your AC 13 + Dex
[3:58:21] <%Allenora> Mage armor is +2 to AC I think
[3:58:22] <Big_Dream> Bane is really good
[3:58:23] <%Spydurman> Mage Armor 13 + Dex Mod
[3:58:24] <mr_slaide> Mage armor = AC
[3:58:25] <danielm427> 13+dex
[3:58:25] <+Draegen86> @PatStaresAt Mage armor = reduces chance to get hit by 15%
[3:58:25] <scrublordsamurai> its dnd
[3:58:27] <+HellCopter> Mage armor = your AC becomes 13+dex
[3:58:27] <+mostbrokenrobo> Good shit
[3:58:28] <%Ne1son> 13 + Dex Mod AC
[3:58:29] <+pectusumbra> It should be 3 or 4 extra AC?
[3:58:31] <wraithtaker162> It's basically a free shield
[3:58:33] <ty2bp> Casts mage armor
[3:58:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I am Bane
[3:58:36] <%aslfrasle> Hadar or Agathys
[3:58:38] <cherrycottontail> In this game, mage armor gives you +3ac
[3:58:42] <lord_sykos> Can never go wrong with pumping up Eldritch Blast
[3:58:42] <%squidking96> arms of hadar, free push
[3:58:47] <+mostbrokenrobo> NOT AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS
[3:58:47] <+pectusumbra> arms of Hadar is AoE
[3:58:47] <mikevens7> armor of agathys
[3:58:48] <%Ne1son> No
[3:58:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Tasha
[3:58:49] <$lotharrio> You want long lasting spells.
[3:58:50] <%Calek> Mage Armour is 13 + Dex instead of the 11 + Dex you got now
[3:58:52] <%Ne1son> Not witchbolt
[3:58:53] <+Pookiedaexzile> Eldtrich Blast Warlock lets fucking gooooooooooo. One Spell One Kill
[3:58:53] <danielm427> hader or armor
[3:58:54] <wraithtaker162> hellish Rebuke is also great
[3:58:55] <%Allenora> I was super wrong lol
[3:58:56] <Sagata_> HADAR
[3:58:58] <%maenos2> hm. shouldn't he already have hellish rebuke? he's a tiefling after all.
[3:58:58] <butthurtdave> Retreat seems like a good fit for positioning yourself
[3:59:01] <%Spydurman> Mage Armor won't do much for you since your Dex is 14 and Warlocks can wear medium armor @PatStaresAt
[3:59:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Hellish Rebuke is great
[3:59:05] <1matheuw> necrotic damage is busted IMO
[3:59:16] <datpineappleguy> Hellish Rebuke
[3:59:17] <reasonance> armor of agathys is really nice imo
[3:59:18] <Wisepheonix> arms of hadar is really good
[3:59:19] <NocturnalRites> they better let you go hexblade in the full release
[3:59:20] <%maenos2> or wait was that from like level 3?
[3:59:21] <OvaltineDream> No u
[3:59:21] <londorpaleale> rebuke Pog
[3:59:22] <+GenesisKnight> Opportunity Attacks
[3:59:23] <butthurtdave> attacks of opportunity
[3:59:24] <+HellCopter> No attacks of opporunity
[3:59:24] <Sagata_> Hellish rebuke is fuckin amazing
[3:59:25] <wraithtaker162> Can't attack of opportunity
[3:59:25] <%aslfrasle> No opportunity attacks.
[3:59:26] <%TheLemuroid> They can't oppurtunity attack you
[3:59:27] <jorniev> retreat has other uses
[3:59:28] <mikevens7> armor of agathys is. busted
[3:59:28] <cheapdoc> no attacks of opportunity
[3:59:29] <+sp_abadidea> Reactions are stuff like Attacks of Opportunity
[3:59:29] <$lotharrio> Reactions like opportunity attacks.
[3:59:29] <Wisepheonix> no attack of oppurtu ity
[3:59:30] <KiryujiKazamoto> you cant watch TheFineBros
[3:59:31] <%Allenora> They can't op attack when you move out of melee
[3:59:31] <lord_sykos> reactions are things they can do on YOUR turn
[3:59:34] <Decarcassor> Reactions are off turn action, like opportunity attacks
[3:59:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> they can't do attacks of oppertunity, good for fleeing
[3:59:36] <jorniev> no attacks of opportunity
[3:59:36] <+esdiorguthre> no opp attacks
[3:59:37] <+pectusumbra> They can't attack of opportunity
[3:59:39] <Goodvibes99508> means you do it instead of opportunity attack
[3:59:40] <%Ne1son> They cant hit you if you run away
[3:59:40] <butthurtdave> Did you look at Retreatt?
[3:59:42] <thatrandomlurkingguy> Arms sounds like fun.
[3:59:42] <Manwad> they can't attack of opportunity or missile catch if monk
[3:59:43] <%MonsterEnvy> I vote Hellish Rebuke
[3:59:44] <ty2bp> No opportunity attacks
[3:59:44] <+senfood> HELLISH REBUKE
[3:59:44] <%Calek> tieflings get hellish rebuke at level 3 anyway don't they
[3:59:44] <+GenesisKnight> Hadar
[3:59:45] <1matheuw> you havent been using attacks of oppurtinity anyway
[3:59:46] <cheapdoc> hellish rebuke is pretty good
[3:59:46] <%maenos2> i'm a dummy tieflings get hellish rebuke at 3
[3:59:48] <+HellCopter> Hellish Rebuke is cool
[3:59:49] <BlkFlameKami> hellish rebuke
[3:59:49] <Kaksoppa> 2d10 omg
[3:59:49] <scrublordsamurai> hellish rebuke
[3:59:51] <ZilverZap> take arms
[3:59:51] <danielm427> cant attack of opportunity
[3:59:51] <bearking05> hellish rebuke
[3:59:53] <%gespenst25> expediois retreat is like haste but you don't get a second attack
[3:59:53] <+MisterAvry> 'buke it
[3:59:53] <aretos1> you get hellish rebuke from being a tiefling
[3:59:54] <wraithtaker162> I once saw a dude do a full 50 damage with Agathys
[3:59:54] <+pectusumbra> mostly it's an early AoE spell
[3:59:55] <londorpaleale> Hellish Rebuke is like "No U"
[3:59:56] <%maenos2> rebuke is REAL useful
[3:59:56] <Coystick> Hellish rebuke is a good use of your reaction
[3:59:56] <aretos1> not worth it
[3:59:57] <%TheLemuroid> Too bad there isn't an overlay vote for this part
[3:59:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> Hellish rebuke. it's guaranteed damage no matter what
[4:00:05] <KiryujiKazamoto> rebukakke
[4:00:07] <%Ne1son> PRAISE HADAR
[4:00:07] <+meikae> bullish rebuke
[4:00:10] <1matheuw> is just speed
[4:00:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> So youre Torn Between Chat Shit and run
[4:00:10] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh yeah never mind Teiflings get Rebuke for free
[4:00:10] <+pectusumbra> so do you want a close range body explosion, or high damage revenge on a single target?
[4:00:10] <jorniev> FREE MOVEMENT
[4:00:13] <Them00n> Tieflings get hellish rebuke for free at level 3
[4:00:16] <+Kyma1020> Hellish rebuke. It fits with you
[4:00:16] <%Allenora> Is it a mostly fighting game or is there a lot of talking? Do we know yet?
[4:00:19] <reasonance> @NocturnalRites only PHB material is confirmed, but they haven't explicitly *denied* any of the XGTE stuff getting in either 🤷
[4:00:20] <+senfood> Hellish Rebuke always reminds me of Last Podcast on the Left.
[4:00:22] <ty2bp> Arms of hadar
[4:00:22] <+MisterAvry> Yes! That way when you use it you can yell "I'm gonna 'buke!"
[4:00:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> Spit hot fire
[4:00:29] <londorpaleale> @Them00n NotLikeThis
[4:00:34] <ty2bp> Tiefling get that anyway
[4:00:35] <jorniev> rap at them
[4:00:39] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt Watch out for spells that say concentration. They're powerful, but you can only have one concentration spell going on at a time. Not only that but getting hit might disrupt concentration spells. Even with both those caveats they're usually the most powerful spells, so I always reccommend a healthy mix of concentration and non-concentration spells.
[4:00:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Hellish Bukkake
[4:00:46] <+Kyma1020> You get hit and go “Ow fuck you bitch”
[4:00:50] <+Oatbran27> yeah tieflings get hellish rebuke at 3 i think
[4:00:51] <+HellCopter> it's just "two weapon fighting"
[4:00:52] <wraithtaker162> I would Kill a Man to get warforged in the game
[4:00:52] <%TheLemuroid> @Them00n He is a variant tiefling
[4:00:53] <ZE_Count> Pat is game good? I need your expert opinion as a gamer.
[4:01:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Bone-Us Action Am I right?
[4:01:01] <+mostbrokenrobo> it's more like a counterstab
[4:01:03] <%TheLemuroid> The offhand is bonus the main hand isnt'
[4:01:05] <Captain_Doomsday> Sneak in a little stabbin'
[4:01:12] <wraithtaker162> Specifically offhand attacks
[4:01:13] <aretos1> you can probably throw the knife
[4:01:16] <wraithtaker162> if you're dual wielding
[4:01:21] <blink289> What is this wizardry with twitch that lets me see your characters?
[4:01:22] <aretos1> to not have to get close
[4:01:25] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat is this basically DND rules?
[4:01:28] <mr_slaide> Nothing beats the hobo life, stabbing folks with my hobo knife.
[4:01:34] <aretos1> yes
[4:01:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> Cast something Ancient and horrible
[4:01:37] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[4:01:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes this is faithful 5e
[4:01:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Then stabb em
[4:01:48] <%TheLemuroid> @Theycallmenerf It is shocking how much it is dnd 5e rules
[4:01:48] <mr_slaide> It's Divinity 3 : Baldurs gate.

[4:02:06] <%Allenora> @Theycallmenerf Yes people were saying it's mostly 5e rules with some tweaks

[4:04:55] <DashXero> Are they infected by mindflayers?!
[4:04:56] <+Nothing_Wild> I think most of these characters will start as evil, but can change. It’d be weird if all of the main cast were evil, from the get-go.

[4:05:19] <%ssjklyco> It's also early access, so it's still being worked on
[4:05:20] <%heartlesshealer> If Pat has reloaded a save, you must refresh for the overlay

[4:07:56] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt game tries to teach you that you pretty early on that you dont need to pick up everything
[4:08:03] <PlatinumWyvern> gotta take the skull, it might be useful later -the mind goblins
[4:08:05] <%Allenora> Clerics are awesome but no one plays them lol
[4:08:06] <%PhysicsLB> It's almost like they're full casters or something
[4:08:08] <%rdark_ksu> yea all that prayin and stuff
[4:08:09] <%Jekado> simple weapons and the weapon of their god too i think for clerics
[4:08:09] <DashXero> how about Tab?
[4:08:11] <Matoryis> "fucking clerics man" -matt mercer
[4:08:14] <StencilOST> A party of clerics can solve ANY problem
[4:08:17] <%Frost_Quill> @St_Burke Blasphemy.
[4:08:17] <+MaskedBugman> Clerics are pretty great in 5e, damage heals, tanking they can do it all
[4:08:19] <1matheuw> you need a black dragon per cleric to have a balanced encounter
[4:08:19] <londorpaleale> Gotta give them that many spells so someone is willing to play a healer.
[4:08:21] <DashXero> In DA:O it was tab...
[4:08:26] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't think you need to alt click chests
[4:08:27] <+Nothing_Wild> Clerics are one of the best classes.
[4:08:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> but you have to
[4:08:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Allenora my favorite class tbh
[4:08:31] <%ssjklyco> Are you new to the channel?
[4:08:32] <%MonsterEnvy> I never picked them up
[4:08:34] <%SABiscotti> psaGoblin
[4:08:37] <+robert_edwards> !uptime
[4:08:37] <@Moobot> @robert_edwards I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m.
[4:08:38] <%heartlesshealer> yeeeeah... if it showed chests that'd be great. But might make it too easy if there are mimics?
[4:08:42] <muddiestpath> try tab?
[4:08:43] <badmr7> What about grave key?
[4:08:43] <%Allenora> Spirit Guardians
[4:08:44] <TheHeroAppears> I don't think you can understand pat
[4:08:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Only play cleric to get path of the grave
[4:08:47] <%hax_metatron> If three is pick up button i cliuck pick up buttn: Pat
[4:08:49] <wraithtaker162> are trickery clerics proficient with thieves tools?
[4:08:49] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaGib Chest
[4:08:51] <$lotharrio> Guidance, Pat.
[4:08:52] <Wisepheonix> try the theives tools on the door
[4:08:54] <silentblast93> siara logic is a hard thing to fight man
[4:08:54] <1matheuw> @StencilOST the A-MEN are stronk
[4:09:04] <%Jekado> wait how
[4:09:06] <St_Burke> doofy
[4:09:06] <$lotharrio> Use the Guidance cantrip to boost your rolls.
[4:09:10] <+Nothing_Wild> Light and Grave are the best, in my opinion.
[4:09:11] <%Parapattern> Looks bad
[4:09:13] <GeneralHysterics> THAT'S A NICE HAT
[4:09:15] <+Pyroclase> Does it have special holes for the horns, or do they just clip?
[4:09:15] <aretos1> holy shit you look stupid
[4:09:15] <+ALazo> it came with horn holes
[4:09:15] <aaronvirtuedge> Hey Pat, glad to finally catch one of your streams!
[4:09:16] <%Broand> Are your horns clipping through it
[4:09:17] <+ALazo> how nice
[4:09:17] <St_Burke> odd lookin fella
[4:09:20] <%rdark_ksu> just shove the hornes through
[4:09:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wear the hat to hide your baldness
[4:09:24] <ty2bp> Cast guidance all the time
[4:09:25] <%heartlesshealer> Of course it is
[4:09:26] <BlacSoul> please let there be a hide hat option
[4:09:28] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaDab
[4:09:29] <%TheLemuroid> The cleric has guidance!
[4:09:31] <Northward12> pat hat
[4:09:31] <xlander27> I can hear the pupper snore, omg
[4:09:31] <%coreyyotto> it bothers me that the horns don't restrict you from wearing it
[4:09:33] <OvaltineDream> it looks funny keep it on
[4:09:34] <St_Burke> isnt that a theives tool check
[4:09:34] <%PhysicsLB> ...pat you need to play more 5th edition
[4:09:34] <jorniev> yes
[4:09:35] <%Frost_Quill> Of course it is.
[4:09:38] <%heartlesshealer> oh wait, she has Guidance?
[4:09:40] <%heartlesshealer> what
[4:09:41] <Coystick> Picking locks: ye olde hacking
[4:09:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Path of the Grave Assassin
[4:09:45] <%Allenora> I came in a little late is it just PHB races or are there others too?
[4:09:47] <butthurtdave> Oh shit I forgot the most important question: Are Monks a class?
[4:09:58] <%aslfrasle> Use Guidance before any skill check.
[4:09:59] <aretos1> Not yer
[4:10:02] <aretos1> yet*
[4:10:03] <%Ranryu692> welcome to decades of D&D QOL improvements lol
[4:10:05] <+MaskedBugman> Not yet
[4:10:07] <jorniev> MONKS are a class
[4:10:07] <Decarcassor> There is Githyanki. And Dragonborns are missing
[4:10:07] <%Nekros4442> Not yet
[4:10:07] <%PhysicsLB> Pretty sure gith are in
[4:10:10] <koffeemancer> yes but not in early access
[4:10:13] <jorniev> they suck now
[4:10:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> Good
[4:10:14] <CursedNobleman> PUNCH
[4:10:16] <+Nothing_Wild> @allenora Little bit more, but all of the PHB are planned.
[4:10:16] <%TheLemuroid> Pat read the description of Guidance cantrip. It is basically a free skill bonus
[4:10:19] <Coystick> When I play Pillars 2 I'mma do all monks
[4:10:20] <alee000> anybody ever played a eldritch knight neverwinter nights 2
[4:10:21] <%aslfrasle> @butthurtdave The wiki seems to list every other class other than the ones in early access.
[4:10:21] <%Typhaeon> I struggle to call some of the oversimplifications in modern editions improvements
[4:10:21] <%rdark_ksu> i wanna be an elemental monk and be the avatar
[4:10:22] <jorniev> in 5e
[4:10:22] <wraithtaker162> Has larian said whether this game will have mod support or nah?
[4:10:22] <%maenos2> i will be shocked if they don't add the other classes
[4:10:26] <%Nekros4442> Waiting for Druids myself
[4:10:27] <%Chimeraelite> tbf Paladins aren't in either.
[4:10:27] <DashXero> When's this game gonna be in not early access?
[4:10:28] <+FatherGreyBeard> Are they going to have all 12 classes?
[4:10:29] <%heartlesshealer> Oh shit, she DOES have Guidance!
[4:10:29] <ty2bp> Only 6 classes
[4:10:37] <GeneralHysterics> this smells like a trap
[4:10:40] <Coystick> Kensei monks>all other 5e monks
[4:10:41] <%Ranryu692> the class list did seem kind of slim (if it were a complete game)
[4:10:41] <CursedNobleman> the worst part about monks is that you dont get to go haha new shineys
[4:10:41] <+JeromeePepperoni> they said everything in the phb will be in eventually
[4:10:47] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, Shadowheart can make your skill checks better when you gotta lockpick
[4:10:48] <%Nekros4442> @DashXero At least a year
[4:10:48] <%maenos2> oh myg od that hat
[4:10:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man feels very Bardy
[4:10:51] <%Allenora> I would like to make a Tabaxi paladin please

[4:15:05] <%vaporousTippler> Get him to say "Aside, peasant!" I'll know for sure then.
[4:15:07] <tonfirean> @DashXero you might need to reload, they've been dropping off for me and reloading fixes it.

[4:18:29] <causewaybob> Pig is figment of imagination
[4:18:30] <%heartlesshealer> because you can choose to not do it
[4:18:33] <%TheLemuroid> Sneak attack is probably passive
[4:18:37] <+Nothing_Wild> @samiscoolbro Basically, but he sucks more than just dicks.
[4:18:40] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Sneak attack only happens if A) They have advantage or B) There's a friend next to the enemy.
[4:18:40] <%maenos2> Pat, the rogue is apparently voiced by Neil Newbon, who played Elijah Kamski in Detroit.

[4:19:57] <jorniev> RAPIER IS DEX WEAPON
[4:19:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> En Garde
[4:20:00] <%Totally_Not_Toby> rapier best rogue weapon
[4:20:01] <KiryujiKazamoto> @Parapattern haha... unless?
[4:20:04] <$lotharrio> He can't dual wield? Weird.
[4:20:04] <Hellarussian> give him a katana for maximum Vergil immersion
[4:20:05] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt You know what else is cool? You playing this game.
[4:20:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> !SWASHBUCKLE WARNING!
[4:20:10] <+Kawaso> does the rapier soon with sneak attack?
[4:20:14] <St_Burke> without the feat you can only equip light weapons two handed
[4:20:17] <+MisterAvry> elf bad, dwarf good
[4:20:17] <%MonsterEnvy> I think you can just drag the portraits to change order
[4:20:18] <aretos1> the rapier's better, rogues only get one sneak attack
[4:20:18] <GeneralHysterics> rapier/dagger is a super real combo but you can't use it here?
[4:20:18] <ZE_Count> Pat is blue.....da ba dee da ba daa.
[4:20:19] <%rdark_ksu> never liked rapiers were so effective for rogues, slashing is more fun that poking
[4:20:20] <GeneralHysterics> lame
[4:20:21] <causewaybob> You know what saints row 4 had the best romance system.
[4:20:31] <KiryujiKazamoto> psaGib huggThanks

[4:20:48] <+GenesisKnight> His name
[4:20:50] <cheapdoc> you get a feat at level 4
[4:20:50] <Gallhint> HIGH ALF
[4:20:50] <mostundesired> That's his name LUL
[4:20:51] <+HellCopter> It's his name
[4:20:52] <%heartlesshealer> Astarion is name
[4:20:52] <%GarbageNirvana> so my laptop has a GTX 1050 do you think this game would make it explode or not
[4:20:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Astarion is his name
[4:20:52] <%Ne1son> His name Pat
[4:20:53] <%maenos2> that's his name.
[4:20:53] <%TheLemuroid> His name?
[4:20:54] <St_Burke> its his name silly
[4:20:54] <thatrandomlurkingguy> Astarion is his name.
[4:20:55] <%Totally_Not_Toby> i see you dhampir
[4:20:55] <butthurtdave> Astarion is his name pat
[4:20:56] <T_Sasquatch> @causewaybob it really went mass effect for that LUL
[4:20:57] <%ssjklyco> His charisma sucks
[4:20:58] <+chattychocobo> LUL
[4:20:59] <KiryujiKazamoto> he doesn't believe in Stars
[4:21:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> clearly
[4:21:03] <DashXero> How is he in the sun if he's a vampire?
[4:21:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> @rdark_ksu Swashbuckling intensifies
[4:21:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Astarion is his name pat
[4:21:08] <%AFlyingTaco1> He literally told you it's his name Pat
[4:21:12] <jorniev> half vampire
[4:21:19] <%GarbageNirvana> actually
[4:21:24] <cheapdoc> I mean, it is an early access demo thing
[4:21:25] <%rdark_ksu> @Pookiedaexzile exactly
[4:21:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hope so. I don't mind a linear rpg now and then.
[4:21:28] <%aishman> Probably not, Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2 begin linear but really open up later.
[4:21:28] <butthurtdave> go sneaky
[4:21:29] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Historically, Dagger was paired with Rapiers in duels the dagger used defensively
[4:21:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> Well, you are basically still in the tutorial
[4:21:31] <DashXero> Don't half vampires have sun problems?
[4:21:37] <%GarbageNirvana> so my laptop has a GTX 1050 do you think this game would make it explode or not
[4:21:40] <+ALazo> He'll suck your blood. Through your dick
[4:21:43] <Decarcassor> If he is a vampire he should be resistant to non magical weapons and make a good tank. :p
[4:21:49] <%slimmixrp> Drop a save
[4:21:50] <St_Burke> HEP THEM
[4:21:50] <BlkFlameKami> SAVE HER PAT
[4:21:55] <+4teenth> It’s funny because of the few play through I’ve seen, each has been different
[4:21:57] <Decarcassor> But he shouldn't be in the sun in the first place yeah
[4:22:01] <jorniev> sneak

[4:48:26] <%Allenora> Paladin low key one of my favorite classes
[4:48:26] <%maenos2> warlocks the best

[4:48:30] <+pectusumbra> Those other ones are more secluded I want to say.
[4:48:31] <%aishman> I'm sure they'll add those later
[4:48:32] <tonfirean> I think Warlock is more of a "standard" class in 5e
[4:48:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> 6 classes, thats 10 dollars a class

[4:48:41] <%bevyrage> Lore wise paladin would have no reason to allow the vampire to join their party, on top of some other xenophobia triggering races you've already encountered.
[4:48:42] <+CatastropheCorvid> Taking their time with the gods and boons?
[4:48:44] <%maskofmichael> early access
[4:48:48] <%TheLemuroid> Yet they had a bunch of half elf sub races
[4:48:48] <+pectusumbra> It makes sense to use the Gith vs. Mindflayers for a hook
[4:48:50] <Sunstalker> Stream pause or stream end?
[4:48:51] <Them00n> All the PHB classes will be in final release.
[4:48:51] <ChungusQuest> They already did Githzerai in Torment. Gotta keep that roster rolling with fresh content.
[4:48:55] <ShichiNoBushi> When you said "Barb", did you mean Bard or Barbarian?
[4:48:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> Everybody loves a Magic Drug Dealer
[4:49:00] <%heartlesshealer> Barbarian might instantly lose, Paladin might suicide or just attack all possible party members
[4:49:21] <%Allenora> Not every paladin has to be lawful stupid though.
[4:49:21] <%TheLemuroid> Paladins aren't as strict in 5e

[4:54:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pathfinder Kingmaker is technically a good game but I hate it
