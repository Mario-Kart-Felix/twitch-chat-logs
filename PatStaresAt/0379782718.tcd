[0:06:17] <derap41> Seize the memes of production
[0:06:19] <bohemiansweeper> Need more unions

[0:39:10] <%kylejefferies> Is dis with mods?
[0:39:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ChaosVulpes Nah, it's a more accurate adaption of the manga

[0:39:16] <InugamiTheHound> wasn't that venom snake?
[0:39:18] <%BioApple> @ChaosVulpes Brotherhood is actually an anti-retcon, it's a straighter adaptation of the manga

[0:39:30] <$GoogleyGareth> The marketing for what MGS V could have been was better than the story itself imo
[0:39:30] <+ChestMimik> @chaosvulpes technically Brotherhood is the original since it matches the manga
[0:39:31] <VanLynx> Didn't Woolie answer that some time ago?
[0:39:32] <+dawsfloss> he didnt start playing yet right?

[0:39:33] <%ssjklyco> The Leeper
[0:39:33] <arcaderabbit48> @ChaosVulpes Brotherhood is an anime adaptation of the entire manga storyline, rather than branching off part way through like the original anime. So not a retcon, but a different timeline

[0:53:33] <%CerberusDriver> Jump Force looks bad, they also kept the UE4 files in the game so you can easily mod it

[0:54:27] <%ThePuddingDead> and he's also a guitarist for a band
[0:54:28] <Nighthawkmun> Hes great
[0:54:28] <lokiluko> Once again, right at start of this 2 man tutorial, smother the light manually, go pitch black, gives more loot, better chance for a key for that trap chest

[0:54:39] <Sitromxe> Reminder: The group heal skill is worthless except when fully upgraded.
[0:54:41] <Nighthawkmun> Wayne June
[0:54:43] <haisho> he is literally what makes Darkest Dungeon what it is
[0:54:45] <DrGibbly> I have listened to like, all his audio books lol

[0:54:47] <pimpinahz> wang Chun??
[0:54:49] <Smaenus> Houndmaster is the best character, I actually don't know if that's true but he has a doggo so he is the best
[0:54:50] <Kathariya> you can hire it to do the donation voice
[0:54:51] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he has the best voice
[0:54:51] <NiftyNox> Came in at the right time
[0:54:52] <%laserbeaming> You can get him as your match narrator in Dota 2
[0:54:53] <MyNameIsRasus> His voice is audio sex
[0:54:53] <axelcezar> nick (bitterbits) actually invited the guy to talk in his stream once
[0:54:56] <Gray_skies1993> Now we just need him to be the narrator in Bloodborne 2

[0:55:08] <%SpamKingRathalos> holy hell
[0:55:08] <sanctified_succ> yes
[0:55:09] <Gamester091> @AngriestPat apparently Wayne also takes commissions
[0:55:10] <%UltraCasualBoom> He would be the only tolerable narrator on a DailyMail Facebook vid

[1:07:20] <The_Blumper> Has Elmo been baptized?
[1:07:25] <Sitromxe> Should have used holy water.
[1:07:26] <%ThePuddingDead> next time have the lowest health and highest stress and holy water them @AngriestPat
[1:07:26] <%SpamKingRathalos> YES
[1:07:31] <%simulationbard> Use holy water on it chat is wrong
[1:07:34] <Dakuu75> does pat still play XIV?
[1:07:37] <dekkitout> smited by god already
[1:07:39] <ScreamingMeat> That's the point
[1:07:42] <+Nomicro4u> holy water would have been a waste this early
[1:07:46] <IminyourBase> YOU FOOL
[1:07:54] <$Tuskor13> PAT
[1:07:58] <DirtyPopcornJ> oh boi
[1:08:02] <%laserbeaming> Speed works like D&D initiative in this game. The game rolls a d20 and adds it to your speed to decide the turn order
[1:08:02] <Vigonept> probably only thing for holy water
[1:08:03] <+StromkoPenguin> Would've had to do this room eventually, need to explore 90% and therwe's only 7 rooms.
[1:08:09] <%Mr_Strut> He learned how to trap
[1:08:11] <UnderpaidBob> i didnt know there were stats there lol
[1:08:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> wao
[1:08:18] <%GohanEgret> clean it up with a whole paper towel roll
[1:08:19] <Rincewind1998> I've put over 200 hrs into this game, so here's some quick advice: A big part of winning fights in this game is the removal of incoming damage. This means abilities that stun are a high priority, and it's much better to focus down one target than spreading the damage around.
[1:08:22] <Smaenus> Paige, when everything fell
[1:08:29] <majindusto> EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE
[1:08:30] <ScreamingMeat> Suprise Muthafuka
[1:08:30] <haisho> oh man no Bone Courtiers in sight
[1:08:43] <%saint01> I love you Pat <3
[1:08:45] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @StromkoPenguin he can skip one room.90% isn't actually 90%
[1:08:45] <%ThePuddingDead> @Rincewind1998 you're not wrong, I dipped out after 580 hours
[1:08:46] <$Tuskor13> @Rincewind1998 or just kill everything before they do anything. THE BEST CC IS DEATH
[1:08:49] <dekkitout> stun and high priority? so every turn based ever then
[1:08:52] <swagshark21> get em
[1:09:01] <IminyourBase> this guys says the coolest shit
[1:09:04] <DirtyPopcornJ> "God says u succ. REPENT"
[1:09:15] <Rincewind1998> @Tuskor13 hence the focusing down targets. Crit builds are the best
[1:09:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> DEUS VULT
[1:09:25] <$Big_King_Coconut> Eat the rock
[1:09:26] <exalt4747> "Give up, skeleton!"
[1:09:27] <gorillahandz> slowly. gently. this is how a baby is rocked
[1:09:27] <majindusto> Paige hates it
[1:09:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> FART WIZARDS
[1:09:32] <Worldbrand> Cool
[1:09:33] <%Raxus_Secundus> Rock emote???
[1:09:35] <%laserbeaming> Spooky Scary Skeletons, send stress waves down your spine
[1:09:36] <arcaderabbit48> Did Blight get buffed at some point? These skills seem better than I remember, and they were already good
[1:09:39] <%ThePuddingDead> equp it and make space
[1:09:43] <zk_nails> put that shit on him now
[1:09:43] <%LogothX> I thought Paige was the geodude
[1:09:44] <IminyourBase> big stress
[1:09:45] <+Haarute> Equip it.
[1:09:47] <pigeontactician> yo you can equip those
[1:09:47] <Jaysky> Yo Pat, I was playing Darkest just before this. How's it going so far?
[1:09:48] <devanmuse> You got a Pet
[1:09:48] <vrusso99> you can slap those trinkets on your characters now
[1:09:48] <%CerberusDriver> the Narrator can make anything sound cool
[1:09:49] <qo_op> equip
[1:09:50] <buffmurffy> equip trinket now
[1:09:52] <%simulationbard> Eqiup the trinkest
[1:09:52] <+StromkoPenguin> Blight / Bleed were always super useful
[1:09:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Equip now
[1:09:56] <sosuke5> but equip it though
[1:09:57] <%ThePuddingDead> YES
[1:09:58] <IminyourBase> YOU FOOL
[1:09:59] <$SGrim> -50% healing is super terrible
[1:10:03] <%Mr_Strut> Did Paige every figure out the mint candy bar?
[1:10:07] <majindusto> No, Paige is confirmed a Vulpix
[1:10:07] <%bearrier_> @angriestpat what about bees made of rocks that are also cubes??
[1:10:08] <dekkitout> PogChamp that's qol af
[1:10:08] <Rincewind1998> it's healign HE does
[1:10:17] <alwayspronking> you did this earlier in the stream in and in the previous stream too
[1:10:17] <%ThePuddingDead> u can also equip that movement trinket on pd for that shuffle stun
[1:10:18] <$Big_King_Coconut> now you jinxed it
[1:10:19] <%simulationbard> He doesn't have any healing skill equipped right now
[1:10:23] <%ElenaManetta> What's better software to make really fast clips from videos: After Effects or Sony Vegas
[1:10:27] <+StromkoPenguin> Yeah that's how I interpreted it too, it just means he won't be healing with the Crusader and he isn't anyway
[1:10:27] <%Raxus_Secundus> Yli
[1:10:27] <Coystick> When's Shambler Altar?
[1:10:30] <%ElenaManetta> quick i need answers NOW CHAT!!!

[1:11:42] <%ThePuddingDead> its radiant he cant fail
[1:11:46] <%UltraCasualBoom> For every season...turn, turn, turn....
[1:11:49] <+Shackle_Rustyford> quality narration
[1:11:50] <cosmicdischarge> Skeleton warrior tadadada ta da da tadada !!!
[1:11:54] <%laserbeaming> I hate Champion Ruins. It has all the worst enemies
[1:12:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's Pat. If anyone can fail it's probably him because of CRAZY TALK.
[1:12:10] <%Mr_Strut> Doot
[1:12:13] <Rincewind1998> Once you've got a target close to death is when it's better to use your AoE moves, because you can kill them while getting some chip in on their buddies
[1:12:14] <$thebonebard> but pat shaka when the walls fell at
[1:12:14] <+SimplyPandaz> Pat most AOE is garbage
[1:12:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Doot
[1:12:17] <Punisher7771> hi pat
[1:12:17] <+Nomicro4u> Ruins has arguably easier enemies if you have good crusaders
[1:12:17] <MasterDecoder> Bone Defender looks like a DA: O Hurlock...
[1:12:19] <%ThePuddingDead> I despise the Weald
[1:12:22] <gustavozxd> @elenamanetta probably Sony Vegas, i think after effects is for crazy complicated stuff
[1:12:23] <krewl123> is pagie still alive?
[1:12:25] <Jaysky> Just cause he's on radiant don't mean his party can't get wiped. Wait till Champion dungeons, of Vvulf
[1:12:27] <%ThePuddingDead> high level Weald is rough
[1:12:30] <%ElenaManetta> ty ty
[1:12:34] <Jaysky> *or Vvulf
[1:12:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Bone Defender is such a badass name
[1:12:36] <%CJett92> @krewl123 unfortunately, she could not be saved
[1:12:43] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Hey @AngriestPat IS guinan a Q?
[1:12:49] <krewl123> @CJett92 noooooooooo
[1:12:52] <+BansheeMaster96> How far are you Pat?
[1:12:54] <+l33t_j4gu4r> i tried playing darkest dungeon on switch. couldn't get used to the controls compared to the pc
[1:12:55] <Gray_skies1993> nice victory Pat!
[1:12:57] <%laserbeaming> AoE is useful on The Farmstead
[1:13:01] <pigeontactician> radiant doesn't change fight difficulty, iirc
[1:13:01] <%ThePuddingDead> its radiant
[1:13:02] <majindusto> Whay are we never allowed to see Paige anymore? BibleThump
[1:13:03] <Endocrom> No, she's kind of a Time Lord though
[1:13:06] <%simulationbard> Wait until Uca
[1:13:06] <Liwyn> !uptime
[1:13:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 13m.
[1:13:06] <%ThePuddingDead> just hit NEXT
[1:13:11] <sosuke5> Everything coming up Pathouse
[1:13:11] <+critfumble_> "graveyard slash" always makes me sing monster mash in my head
[1:13:12] <%laserbeaming> that's a good haul
[1:13:12] <majindusto> "why"
[1:13:13] <%bearrier_> @angriestpat what about bees made of rocks that are also cubes??
[1:13:21] <lokiluko> shouldnt you make it pitch black if you only have one last chest to open? better loot pool with no risk right?
[1:13:21] <haisho> oh look the Crusader is now Pat
[1:13:23] <+Nomicro4u> On guard is really good
[1:13:25] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> They don‚Äôt want to cross the streams?
[1:13:28] <%klutch02> Hey Pat, have you ever beaten this before or is this your first run?
[1:13:30] <Kataguro> Batosai
[1:13:31] <@Pandora_Prime> SEE LOOK HOW EASY THIS GAME IS!
[1:13:31] <gustavozxd> loot sound effects are the best even if it's shitty loot
[1:13:34] <majindusto> Boooooo
[1:13:37] <%bestwaifuritsu> rip Plague waifu
[1:13:38] <%laserbeaming> On Guard is great. Hot to Trot is godlike
[1:13:39] <+StromkoPenguin> @klutch02 He has only played a small amount
[1:13:41] <%ooblagis> On Guard is super good
[1:13:42] <shadowgilgamesh> "put me in the ground, I'm done"
[1:13:47] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> Easy peasy VoHiYo
[1:13:49] <$Tuskor13> GOD that voice is so good
[1:13:56] <definitelynotyakra> Yeah, those negative quirks stack up quick
[1:13:57] <%ThePuddingDead> that aint a lot dude...thats PAULTRY
[1:13:57] <gorillahandz> reynauld be like "fuck everything"
[1:13:58] <alwayspronking> get rid of Klepto
[1:14:01] <majindusto> I loved the crossing of streams
[1:14:02] <+Nomicro4u> Whoah your Highwayman has really good perks
[1:14:05] <%SpamKingRathalos> lots if good quirks
[1:14:06] <%ThePuddingDead> you come with them
[1:14:06] <%Validuntil2077> Man apparently Radiant mode increases dodge chance and passive town stress heal. Coward mode confirmed
[1:14:07] <swagshark21> ur bad
[1:14:09] <Jaysky> On guard is definitely sweet, especially if you want to wipe the field before the enenmy can even blink
[1:14:10] <+unknowingchuck> klepto is the worse skill
[1:14:11] <Megapikman132> They started with them.
[1:14:12] <%dimeybot> @angriestpat With +4SPD you MUST buy Point Blank Shot for Dismas and rock him in 1st slot.
[1:14:14] <%simulationbard> Hot to Tot is amazing
[1:14:14] <%ThePuddingDead> lose the klepto tho
[1:14:15] <Jaysky> Or take a swipe
[1:14:16] <%Urgotfantasy> they're defauly negatives
[1:14:16] <%SpamKingRathalos> Except Klepto
[1:14:18] <$thebonebard> so does the heir running the place have the same voice
[1:14:18] <axelcezar> reynald got a heavy past, don't judge him!
[1:14:19] <Dakuu75> "will never drink" is a debuff? lol
[1:14:19] <haisho> oh boy Occultists
[1:14:20] <Kataguro> +0 BLEED
[1:14:21] <alwayspronking> YEYEYEYE 0 heal bleed LUL
[1:14:21] <%CerberusDriver> Get that klepto gone
[1:14:22] <+Haarute> Occultists are the shit.
[1:14:22] <vrusso99> yep all healers
[1:14:22] <%SpamKingRathalos> Klepto is the fucking worse
[1:14:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> "weak grip on life" me too, buddy
[1:14:25] <%dimeybot> 0! Crit! Bleed!
[1:14:27] <+ChaosVulpes> Look out! He's a foreigner man from a foreigner land!
[1:14:28] <%laserbeaming> WARRIOR OF LIGHT
[1:14:33] <%laserbeaming> That's fucking good
[1:14:34] <Jaysky> Occultists are pretty great (in Cove)
[1:14:37] <%Urgotfantasy> Occult man in the shit
[1:14:38] <%bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[1:14:39] <mr_slaide> They have big heals, but can inflect bleed and do 0.
[1:14:43] <%AirlineFood74> Is the music super fucked up for anybody else or just me?
[1:14:43] <SophisticHades> occultists are the best
[1:14:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> do your best pat!
[1:14:47] <Kataguro> Gamble
[1:14:47] <pectusumbra> unreliable single target heal. in exchange lots of support and damage vs. ALIENS
[1:14:53] <vrusso99> healers always a good recruit, especially in the beginning
[1:14:54] <%Raxus_Secundus> Though the night is dark and full of terrors, it is late. Later chat
[1:14:55] <%klutch02> @StromkoPenguin oh thanks!
[1:14:57] <+Haarute> They can heal for 0 and bleed you teorethically but more often than not it'll be worth it for big heals.
[1:14:58] <%ThePuddingDead> its quiet cuz people dont like the OST
[1:15:00] <%simulationbard> 2 Vestel, 2 Occ party lets go
[1:15:00] <+chrissycht> Dont give up skeleton!
[1:15:06] <+dodge_and_dust> occultists are great
[1:15:10] <pigeontactician> occultists are dope
[1:15:11] <Jaysky> OST is great though
[1:15:11] <Endocrom> Occultists can pull which destroys corpses
[1:15:11] <+Ilpala271> lol tuckered out
[1:15:14] <axelcezar> occultist is a great cannon, the double back attack is amazing
[1:15:18] <pigeontactician> bring some bleed heal tho
[1:15:21] <zk_nails> cant have too many vessels
[1:15:21] <%ThePuddingDead> yo early game Antiquarian tho
[1:15:22] <+dodge_and_dust> so has Pat fucked up yet or has he not done a run yet?
[1:15:22] <%zerocruz> Im apatBig dumb, how does this game works again ?
[1:15:24] <alcoholicstpmom> TURN UP THE MUSIC
[1:15:32] <%laserbeaming> 2nd position Occultist is fantastic
[1:15:33] <vrusso99> Kleptomaniac is the worst
[1:15:33] <+RawrzorsGrrr> Klepto has to go
[1:15:34] <IminyourBase> you think THOSE are bad?
[1:15:35] <+dodge_and_dust> Kelpto is the real killer
[1:15:41] <Rincewind1998> Yo Pat, who's your favorite class?
[1:15:46] <Jaysky> Fuck the Klept
[1:15:47] <haisho> god fearing is fine but Klepto? Definitely needs to go
[1:15:50] <Gray_skies1993> you're fine on Stress
[1:15:53] <+dodge_and_dust> Kelpto means they STEAL loot
[1:15:55] <%simulationbard> Kelpto is one of the worst negitive quirks
[1:15:56] <exalt4747> What is the punishment for stealing, then?
[1:16:00] <+Nomicro4u> Need some stress heal soon
[1:16:01] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dodge_and_dust) (warning)
[1:16:02] <%ThePuddingDead> leave reynauld and dismas and take others, even out ur lvls
[1:16:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Curtained rooms, where they employ Viera and Vulpixes.
[1:16:10] <%dimeybot> *patiently waits for Whipman Bloodboy to appear*
[1:16:13] <+Nomicro4u> MORE ROCKS
[1:16:19] <+miguelrod777> Kleptomaniacs are almost as bad as litters
[1:16:26] <Kataguro> Blud
[1:16:37] <buffmurffy> why not try an occultis?
[1:16:37] <%dimeybot> Hellion a trash
[1:16:38] <Rincewind1998> Bleed resist is super useful in the Cove
[1:16:38] <%CerberusDriver> "ive seen nothing horrific :)"
[1:16:40] <%brackboi> !uptime
[1:16:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 16m.
[1:16:43] <%zerocruz> Woah wait how does the stress mechanic work ?
[1:16:45] <Jaysky> exalt4747 they just swipe it, you don't get the loot at the end. Unless you mean punishment to the character. The punishment is an unfortunate death.
[1:16:46] <+cjellex> Flagellants are the best class in the game
[1:16:57] <axelcezar> i want some big tiddy anime girl mods!
[1:16:59] <+Nomicro4u> More stress = bad
[1:17:04] <+Nomicro4u> Less stress = good
[1:17:04] <%dimeybot> Flagellants are genuine tanks
[1:17:05] <Hydrapissed> @zerocruz they build up stress and either go crazy or heroic
[1:17:10] <%Das_Bass> stress go UP
[1:17:11] <Endocrom> Self buffing blood mages Woo!
[1:17:14] <Kataguro> CURIOUS
[1:17:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:17:18] <heybenice> Mostly crazy
[1:17:19] <Ion_LaserX> LUL
[1:17:25] <%AirlineFood74> @zerocruz at 100 stress there's a resolve roll, which can give a positive quirk or negative. @ 200 they just die
[1:17:25] <Hydrapissed> mostly crazy yeah
[1:17:27] <Rincewind1998> antivenom
[1:17:27] <+TintainiumCan> Pat help, Black Prior's light shove light is doing my head in
[1:17:35] <%ThePuddingDead> @zerocruz If it reaches 100, ur char can either lose their shit or get a buff, if it reaches 200 u lose your health via heart attack, if u dont heal and get hit, you may die
[1:17:35] <+unknowingchuck> switch the vestal and plauge
[1:17:39] <raven_frame> Yo, we down for the Darkest of Dungeons!
[1:17:42] <RyuuAoi> Greek non fat yogurt supports angriestpat
[1:17:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NICE
[1:17:52] <%AncelDeLambert> wait. GUNS?!
[1:17:58] <Hydrapissed> guns
[1:18:00] <Jaysky> At 200 stress they have a heart attack, they still have a chance of surviving though
[1:18:02] <%dimeybot> give that guy a sippy cup, he keeps spilling his juice
[1:18:05] <%Validuntil2077> Stress goes up on a bar independent from health, 100 stress triggers a resolve test (either real good or real bad) 200 stress triggers heart attack which is instant 0 hp
[1:18:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> GUN GO UP
[1:18:08] <Endocrom> Flintlocks

[1:18:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 18m.
[1:18:19] <$thebonebard> @zerocruz lots of things cause it, characters can obtain personality debuffs that can cause it, if its full then they get a negative personality quirk and if it gets full again they get a hart attack that puts them at deaths door and need immediate healing or else that character dead
[1:18:20] <Hydrapissed> pistols muskets cannons GALORE
[1:18:25] <Endocrom> Enemy cannons later
[1:18:37] <IminyourBase> can't staunch the squanch
[1:18:37] <redsynod> Like in WW1
[1:18:37] <$MajorCrasher> BUY BANDAGES
[1:18:42] <Gray_skies1993> good moves Pat

[1:18:53] <%simulationbard> Heart attacks knock heros down to zero health, unless they're already on zero health in which cause they just die
[1:18:53] <Gray_skies1993> BIG VICTORY

[1:19:46] <Smaenus> @AngriestPat You can use the torch for free in combat
[1:19:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can torch in a fight
[1:19:53] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> I love Wayne June's narration, the fact he has a YT channel where he just reads shit makes me happy
[1:19:57] <%bestwaifuritsu> Im reinstalling the shit out of it right now
[1:20:00] <haisho> I like how missing produces that distinct sound of FAILUTE
[1:20:01] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat hit your torch
[1:20:05] <shadowgilgamesh> I love the sound that move makes when it misses
[1:20:09] <+Haarute> @AngriestPat You can click on torches as the screen transitions into a room. I constantly remember to do it last second too.
[1:20:10] <%ThePuddingDead> @zerocruz I recommend it, just be aware it can kick u in the stomach, but the replayability is STAGGERING
[1:20:12] <MalignantUpper> i always play above 75 light cause im a little weenie hut junior
[1:20:13] <bohemiansweeper> Use torch
[1:20:15] <haisho> yes I said FAILUTE. It was a typo and I'm sticking with iot
[1:20:15] <+RawrzorsGrrr> You can light the torch in combat

[1:20:36] <Rincewind1998> Man, I love highwayman
[1:20:38] <%Validuntil2077> Radiant mode increases dodge chance right?
[1:20:39] <+Nomicro4u> Low light = more loot and higher crit
[1:20:42] <$spacehouse> HERBS
[1:20:43] <+Nomicro4u> but also more stress etc

[1:35:15] <%unclekulikov> Jesters are pro-level ONLY
[1:35:16] <+Haarute> Jester literally dances across slots and buffs Finale, which is a super powerful single use ability. Also he has stress relief.

[1:36:15] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat All of the Jester's attacks add a damage buff to Finale. So halfway through a battle, you can annihilate a fucker in any given row.

[1:40:15] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat you're 2
[1:40:16] <%ThePuddingDead> its a finisher
[1:40:16] <gsoto83> OH BOy
[1:40:19] <+Nomicro4u> finale is no good because he doesn't have the move up
[1:40:22] <leinadtonu> mmm
[1:40:22] <%Niney_Who> But you can't use it from 3rd spot
[1:40:24] <JINcredible1> finale gets buffed by everything else
[1:40:25] <$thebonebard> oh so thats what finale is
[1:40:27] <JINcredible1> then its crazy
[1:40:27] <Hydrapissed> hes buffs be good dats bout ti
[1:40:32] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Finale is a once-per-battle skill with a massive damage and crit bonus. Each skill increases that bonus. After a time, it's basically a free kill on most units.
[1:40:33] <Kataguro> DAE-mon's pull
[1:40:33] <%ElenaManetta> Jester is a very strategy-based guy. Every move affects everything else, he only has a couple "just fucking attack" moves
[1:40:33] <+smargh1015> he'll figure it out eventually guys
[1:40:34] <%KaizenChaos> An attack that can one shot boss
[1:40:39] <%simulationbard> Expect you have no way to get him to first rank
[1:40:40] <Stratrat> jester looks like hes straight outta slipknot
[1:40:42] <pigeontactician> pull an archer up front
[1:40:42] <Piratedude12> this this a bad first choice for an angriest pat stream?

[1:41:27] <%ThePuddingDead> she's got good blight moves
[1:41:30] <leinadtonu> good clown
[1:41:30] <stabbityrabbit> Jester is useless though. Kappa
[1:41:31] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Battle Ballad literally wins boss fights, it's Crit chance, Dodge chance, AND Speed.
[1:41:32] <%dimeybot> WHO'S LUTEING
[1:41:35] <Hydrapissed> just like paige
[1:41:36] <foreverN2dust> I miss graverobber having a super high crit chance
[1:41:38] <lotharrio> Oh sick, that's a new character type.
[1:41:39] <Estuko> Pocket SNAKES
[1:41:42] <+dodge_and_dust> RIPOSTE
[1:41:43] <%ThePuddingDead> buff with him too
[1:41:45] <HazedNConfused> retribution is super good
[1:41:45] <+Cavumentum> RIPOSTE
[1:41:45] <admiral_of_crunch> Oh hey Pat's playing a game I can watch without fear of spoilers
[1:41:45] <Zebroneath> Retribution is real good
[1:41:48] <gsoto83> Snakes, the skeletons natural enemy
[1:41:50] <%simulationbard> Ripost
[1:41:51] <Zunopiedra09> riposte
[1:41:51] <+unknowingchuck> dont take too long too attack
[1:41:51] <+NameInsertable> He brought the jester into the ruins?
[1:41:51] <%Keyd00d> what's dat
[1:41:52] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SICK TUNES, JESTER
[1:41:53] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat always reposte
[1:41:54] <+Haarute> Use Retribution, it's the shit.
[1:41:56] <Watson_dabox> i see this game and want to play, play for like 15 mins then remember why i stopped
[1:42:02] <Gray_skies1993> RETRIBUTION
[1:42:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wats riposte
[1:42:03] <dekkitout> dont you hate it when people suddenly throw pit vipers at you
[1:42:06] <%dimeybot> Buff Jester and protect him with MaA, then fuck everyone with Finale ezgg
[1:42:06] <Estuko> @Watson_dabox what made you stop?
[1:42:08] <CrimsonFox777> Is Paige getting lost in her own house?
[1:42:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> PARRY KING
[1:42:10] <arcaderabbit48> Is it weird to anyone else that skeletons, made of bone and lacking blood, are weak to blight?
[1:42:12] <%CerberusDriver> Pocket Vipers!
[1:42:15] <admiral_of_crunch> Are we yelling advice at Pat? I've got 300 hours in this shit sign me up
[1:42:15] <Stratrat> @AngriestPat skelmo is prob cheering for the other skelitons.
[1:42:16] <HazedNConfused> retribution
[1:42:17] <nutimik> riposte is attack the enemy when they attack you
[1:42:17] <leinadtonu> Man, Pat's sister is so supportive.
[1:42:17] <Hydrapissed> Trianglulating POSTIONS based on knowing the rooms now
[1:42:19] <captainthunderwolf> @foreverN2dust At least Lunge is good!
[1:42:19] <+Cavumentum> Retribution, pat!
[1:42:19] <Zunopiedra09> yes
[1:42:19] <+dodge_and_dust> use it!
[1:42:20] <+Arathiun> you have FOUR beds?!
[1:42:22] <Zebroneath> @DesuDesuDokiDoki You auto counter when you are attacked
[1:42:23] <Zunopiedra09> use it
[1:42:25] <%dimeybot> Retribution is MaA best skill for real
[1:42:25] <Estuko> @dekkitout I gotta run past the pit snake throwers on my way to work, always a pain
[1:42:26] <%ThePuddingDead> hit the blight guy
[1:42:27] <@Pandora_Prime> probably his best skill
[1:42:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[1:42:31] <admiral_of_crunch> Retribution is a counter stance + weak attack
[1:42:33] <+unknowingchuck> parry
[1:42:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOOOOOO
[1:42:34] <HazedNConfused> yeah it is
[1:42:37] <Zebroneath> yeyeye
[1:42:38] <MrTickleTrunk> Kreygasm
[1:42:38] <+dodge_and_dust> riposte is a counter. it is the BEST
[1:42:40] <$GoogleyGareth> Exactly why it's good lol
[1:42:40] <captainthunderwolf> @arcaderabbit48 It's sort of poorly explained, but Blight is a catch-all for disease, poison, AND acid.
[1:42:41] <Piratedude12> yeyeyeye
[1:42:41] <%ThePuddingDead> keeep buffin
[1:42:42] <UnderpaidBob> stack those buffs
[1:42:42] <Zunopiedra09> PowerUpR
[1:42:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE WALL
[1:42:43] <chancho4tierra> buff stacks
[1:42:44] <SchroedingersFerret> Like in Ride to Hell?
[1:42:45] <Gray_skies1993> BEST MAA SKILL
[1:42:45] <Smaenus> Highway man can do that too can't he?
[1:42:46] <+Haarute> And now use his protect ability on someone else.
[1:42:47] <admiral_of_crunch> NOW USE HIS SHIELD
[1:42:49] <+unknowingchuck> keep spamming bufff
[1:42:51] <Run44forrest> 1 bed for pat 1 bed for paige 1 for elmo and another for skelmo
[1:42:51] <Watson_dabox> @Estuko a combo of being too repetitive for my taste and too rng. I love the art style and idea behind the stress system though.
[1:42:52] <chancho4tierra> STACK BUFF
[1:42:53] <$GoogleyGareth> Keep stacking that buff I'd say
[1:42:56] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat you didn't buy his movement skill
[1:42:57] <Shadicara> Gotta throw more snakes pat
[1:43:00] <+ArcLifth> buff stacks on jester
[1:43:01] <Piratedude12> start the fight with jester in first
[1:43:06] <arcaderabbit48> @captainthunderwolf Yeah, I guess that makes sense. As much sense as it can make, anyway
[1:43:06] <%reddpop_> OCC IS THE SHIT
[1:43:09] <lionmanguy> Pat this party comp kinda sucks
[1:43:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stack buff
[1:43:10] <TranquilTurnip> Finale is super fun
[1:43:10] <Endocrom> Dirk stab gets you to the front, finale does a lot of damage and puts you in the back
[1:43:12] <%dimeybot> keep winding up the buffs and protecccc with MaA
[1:43:14] <MrTickleTrunk> Ceiling Spaghetti !!<3
[1:43:16] <%Niney_Who> Occultist shoulds C'THULHU FTAGEN
[1:43:17] <MrTickleTrunk> <3
[1:43:17] <axelcezar> why you don't understand that you must kill the enemies before they attack you?
[1:43:20] <admiral_of_crunch> Yeah, give Jester attacks that move him forward if you want to use finale
[1:43:24] <Estuko> @Watson_dabox that's one of my problems, I'm in love with the art/lore/style but I don't think I can play it.
[1:43:27] <IminyourBase> can switch him now
[1:43:27] <dekkitout> aint no magic better then tentacle-based magic
[1:43:31] <HazedNConfused> respite lasts for 3 rounds
[1:43:32] <$GoogleyGareth> You keep the parry for a few turns fyi
[1:43:36] <%AirlineFood74> ( Õ†¬∞ Õüüî¥ Õ°¬∞) Overclownfidence is a slow and hilarious killer ( Õ†¬∞ Õüüî¥ Õ°¬∞)
[1:43:38] <+Haarute> You don't need to use retribution every turn, riposte lasts for a couple turns.
[1:43:40] <%Corporate_Redeemer> ROCKS
[1:43:41] <Piratedude12> occ has those hentai powers
[1:43:45] <captainthunderwolf> @Endocrom It's really smart, because it also functions as a, "Get me the FUCK away from those front-liners" skill.
[1:43:49] <$GoogleyGareth> oof this split
[1:43:50] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat move jester 1 spot
[1:43:57] <+Gohyakuen> move jester
[1:43:59] <nutimik> he's p good
[1:44:00] <CurrySauseBandit> @axelcezar Dude it takes most people A LONG time before they understadn that.
[1:44:02] <Watson_dabox> @Estuko i put like 12 hours into it, im not a huge fan but i dont really regret buying it.
[1:44:02] <UnderpaidBob> highway man has one too
[1:44:05] <admiral_of_crunch> Man At Arms is a hero
[1:44:05] <%Mr_Strut> Highwayman also has riposte
[1:44:06] <%Superstarsage> @Watson_dabox Class mods and other overhaul mods really do help to spice things up and keep it fresh.
[1:44:06] <gsoto83> one of the best tanks in the game
[1:44:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat has a ninja AND a nonja in his party!
[1:44:07] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat move jester into second slot when out of combat?
[1:44:08] <+unknowingchuck> noo just spam buff
[1:44:09] <Mnightshyamallama> scouting in this game is soooo fuckin nice
[1:44:14] <%MegboyManuel> Man at arms is a great show
[1:44:15] <+dodge_and_dust> you can move party member around out of battlke
[1:44:15] <Rincewind1998> MaA legit one of the best characters in the game. He trivializes certain boss fights
[1:44:18] <+Nomicro4u> snek
[1:44:22] <%dimeybot> He could probably get away with MaA in 3rd? Jester 2nd? Speargirl 1st?
[1:44:24] <%MegboyManuel> Is man at arms still doing video?
[1:44:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Look at that Naruto comedia del arte fuck
[1:44:25] <%simulationbard> MaA is probably my favorite class
[1:44:27] <leinadtonu> highway man's riposte is the shit.
[1:44:28] <Endocrom> Man at arms MAMAROU that Jester!
[1:44:28] <axelcezar> @CurrySauseBandit for "special" people maybe
[1:44:31] <admiral_of_crunch> That skeleton is now dead, you killed him
[1:44:32] <ShichiNoBushi> What about Many Faces, Ram Man, and the other Masters of the Universe?
[1:44:33] <Piratedude12> ready for that crit finale
[1:44:37] <nutimik> but he was blighted
[1:44:40] <MrTickleTrunk> 2 turns?
[1:44:40] <$GoogleyGareth> Hover over the icon.
[1:44:42] <+dickbuttwoman> Pat, he would have died anyway
[1:44:43] <+Gohyakuen> he was dead
[1:44:43] <admiral_of_crunch> NOOOO WASTED
[1:44:44] <ebonifragaria> Henloooo pat you stinky ginger
[1:44:45] <+ArcLifth> you still have the buff
[1:44:45] <+dodge_and_dust> remember that DOTs hit at the start of the turn and can kill enemies for you
[1:44:46] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis the blight would have killed him
[1:44:48] <$GoogleyGareth> Marked doesn't mean they'll attack you
[1:44:57] <+mcjimbo12> man at arms is the shit there is nothing cooler in media than a 1h weapon+ slamming dudes in the face with your shields
[1:44:57] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat increased chance, not guarentee

[1:45:00] <+unknowingchuck> they resist the bleed
[1:45:01] <reonome> why did you kill a blighted enemy lol
[1:45:01] <Megapikman132> Yes pat.

[1:45:06] <IminyourBase> read the skill you fool
[1:45:07] <+ArcLifth> Pat, read the skill
[1:45:09] <+RawrzorsGrrr> occ heals can make you bleed
[1:45:09] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat the occ heal can cause a bleed
[1:45:10] <%dimeybot> oh here we go, Pat will lose his shit
[1:45:11] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat you should try Duelist Advance and Pointblank shot on a Highway man, its really really fun
[1:45:11] <gunstar73> Remember blights pat you wasted an attack
[1:45:11] <UnderpaidBob> its a good heal tho
[1:45:12] <%Rngiddion> read your skills
[1:45:12] <%AncelDeLambert> why aren't these skeletons BLEEDING!?!!!!!!!
[1:45:12] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Marked raises chance to be attacked by roughly 30%, but it's not a guarantee.
[1:45:15] <CurrySauseBandit> @axelcezar Most people are special then.
[1:45:15] <+mcjimbo12> shield is the coolest waepon in the world and i will fight anyone who disagrees
[1:45:16] <%AirlineFood74> Pat can't read skills LUL
[1:45:17] <Gray_skies1993> oh god he doesn't know about the OCC bleed-heal
[1:45:18] <Conky89> No quarters, only dimes
[1:45:19] <+Cadwae> Pat is bad at reading
[1:45:19] <Smaenus> @AngriestPat Occultist does big heals, but can also bleed your team
[1:45:28] <admiral_of_crunch> @AngriestPat DoTs proc at the start of the enemy turn. That skeleton was already dead and wouldn't have gotten an attack in before dying to blight.
[1:45:36] <gunstar73> Pat there all bones how would they bleed
[1:45:38] <%Niney_Who> and then he didn't
[1:45:38] <Estuko> @mcjimbo12 the crunch of a shield against some fucker's face is beautiful.
[1:45:40] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat you can also have MaA protect a party member with a massive def buff
[1:45:43] <%laserbeaming> Back Row Occultist DansGAme
[1:45:44] <%Agami23> no, pat. READ the skill
[1:45:46] <%AncelDeLambert> take THAT, mime!

[1:45:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[1:45:59] <chancho4tierra> Marked: most likely to be attacked and some skills do more damage Rposte: retaliates attacks, combo with guard skills
[1:45:59] <+unknowingchuck> the buffs stack
[1:46:00] <redsynod> Wha skill
[1:46:02] <TranquilTurnip> Don't Kill Jestah
[1:46:05] <gsoto83> Wait till he gets to the warden and theres all that PROC damage he has to do
[1:46:05] <$thebonebard> god i would love if he just kept getting bleed resist all the way to the end
[1:46:10] <%Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat that heal has a 60% bleed chance on it
[1:46:11] <+Haarute> Now it wore off.
[1:46:11] <captainthunderwolf> @Estuko Rampart is one of the conceptually coolest attacks in the game. You take your shield, and you SMACK a fucker in the face so hard he shuffles back.
[1:46:12] <admiral_of_crunch> Oh wait Jester Vs skeletons? ehh
[1:46:18] <%ThePuddingDead> guard jester then retribution for lolz
[1:46:23] <nutimik> you can hover over buff icons
[1:46:26] <$thebonebard> the healing skill
[1:46:27] <HazedNConfused> read the icon after you use it
[1:46:27] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat read what MARK does
[1:46:28] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat When an enemy is blighted/bleeding, and they will die due to the blight/bleed, then you can leave them alone. The blight/bleed hits before they act.
[1:46:28] <%Rngiddion> no the occultist heal we meant
[1:46:28] <%DeathsDoom> hover over icons on health
[1:46:29] <+solotheloso> Hover over the icon for Riposte to see its duration.
[1:46:29] <Gray_skies1993> we meant read the OCC skill Pat
[1:46:30] <Intolerable> OCCULTIST
[1:46:34] <Finakala> BIG heals
[1:46:36] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Riposte guarantees counter-attack, and the Mark gives him a ~30% higher chance to be attacked.
[1:46:37] <SophisticHades> riposte and guard are different
[1:46:38] <haisho> oh man where are my 0HP heal bleeds
[1:46:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Why is Zubaz in Pat's party and where's his fucking rope?

[1:48:55] <admiral_of_crunch> RNG
[1:48:55] <luckysteak> you are unlucky with that
[1:48:56] <+ArcLifth> its not guaranteed
[1:48:57] <nutimik> mark only increases chance
[1:48:57] <%Niney_Who> It isn't 100% definite to attack marked targets
[1:48:58] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat It's increased chances
[1:48:58] <TranquilTurnip> It increases the likelyness
[1:48:58] <reonome> RNG
[1:48:59] <haisho> not guaranteed
[1:49:01] <%Everpresent_Overseer> It's Paige Disease
[1:49:01] <%SpamKingRathalos> Marks are not gurantee

[1:49:01] <Gray_skies1993> they don't have to attack marked targets
[1:49:02] <Finakala> Maggots aren't easily provoked
[1:49:02] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Marked increases chance to be attacked by about a thir, but does not guaranteee it.
[1:49:02] <mr_slaide> It increase the chance, it does not guarantee.
[1:49:05] <chancho4tierra> 30%
[1:49:05] <+ArcLifth> else it would be super overpowered

[1:50:21] <splatinum129> he cant bleed he got no blood
[1:50:21] <sosuke5> They're SKELETONS
[1:50:25] <Piratedude12> skeletons have 200 bleed resist
[1:50:25] <Zebroneath> You can't bleed a skeleton, Pat LUL
[1:50:28] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat how does a skeleton bleed pat
[1:50:31] <lionmanguy> Wait you can't stack bolster anymore?
[1:50:33] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[1:50:33] <+solotheloso> It'd be a pretty good idea to rely on stacking Jester's buff skill (Ballad) every turn you can when fighting undead. His relatively low damage output without bleed or Finale means he's a more effective buffer than DPS in this map.
[1:50:34] <CrimsonFox777> @AngriestPat Skeletons have a base Bleed Resistance of 200%. They're not going to bleed.
[1:50:34] <%ThePuddingDead> yes>

[1:51:05] <%Kduff89> paige knows about skele mens
[1:51:05] <+solotheloso> With effective use, Jester can stack so many buffs that your characters gain MASSIVE advantage.
[1:51:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Marrow?
[1:51:07] <+unknowingchuck> it is a good team
[1:51:08] <+dodge_and_dust> it's not amazing
[1:51:08] <%ThePuddingDead> 11111
[1:51:08] <reonome> YA THINK
[1:51:10] <admiral_of_crunch> Nope
[1:51:10] <SpookySpaghooti> hey Patlords
[1:51:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> HOLY WATER
[1:51:11] <%ThePuddingDead> your bad
[1:51:12] <televisedrevolt> It isn't
[1:51:12] <%BestTeaMaker> lol really?
[1:51:12] <%Keyd00d> it's fine
[1:51:13] <+solotheloso> But he has to be deployed effectively.
[1:51:13] <Gray_skies1993> gee you think
[1:51:14] <VRNK> dont @me
[1:51:15] <lionmanguy> No, not it isn't
[1:51:16] <%simulationbard> not great
[1:51:18] <chancho4tierra> Jester: Stack buff Man at arms: guard / riposte
[1:51:18] <%laserbeaming> Could be better, if your sklls made synergy
[1:51:18] <foreverN2dust> It's your skills mostly, team is fine
[1:51:18] <MrTickleTrunk> this is a great composition actually. jester is just bad vs skeletons
[1:51:19] <+NameInsertable> It's not bad you just don't have the right skills selected
[1:51:20] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAAAAAAT your jester-mime-ninja isn't working?
[1:51:20] <%Sephrim> They seem to be doing better than last team
[1:51:20] <axelcezar> bone marrow leakage maybe
[1:51:21] <definitelynotyakra> Man at arms is mainly there for buffs, he's not great as a fighter
[1:51:21] <%AirlineFood74> it's fine
[1:51:21] <Punisher7771> your bone marrow creattes your blood
[1:51:22] <nutimik> it's fine but you need jester's move skill
[1:51:22] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you just need a better... well everything
[1:51:23] <+dickbuttwoman> You can hit the button to the bottom right to auto-return to the original comp positions.
[1:51:24] <splatinum129> don't bring jesters to the skeltoon house
[1:51:24] <gunstar73> It‚Äôs super bad
[1:51:24] <+skylerpilot> @The_UnfathoMarble yeah I know that, just wondering if it only attracts enemies with the + to marked attacks or if it actually counts as a semi taunt on everything
[1:51:24] <luckysteak> @AngriestPat Make sure to learn how enemy positions affect their attacks!
[1:51:25] <$soupjunkie> not with these skills
[1:51:25] <%Niney_Who> If you changed up some skills, maybe
[1:51:28] <Piratedude12> burn books
[1:51:28] <PiCheese> you don't have the right skills
[1:51:29] <%Thecasualotaku> they have terrible non synergystic skills
[1:51:29] <gsoto83> I think if you had an arbalist instead of the jester, you would like it
[1:51:32] <haisho> should have swapped Shieldbreaker for Musketeer
[1:51:34] <snake_zen> pat it is the skills not the team
[1:51:34] <IminyourBase> they are doing their best
[1:51:38] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Just in case you hadn't caught on, the Occultist has a mild chance to bleed a party member with his big heal - about 10% for most classes, who all have their own Bleed resist chances.
[1:51:38] <%AirlineFood74> Jester's lack of move skill is hurting the composition
[1:51:39] <%sourceofall> you have 2 guys who want to move around a lot and 2 guys who don't want to move ever
[1:51:39] <Nighthawkmun> Youre doing good pat
[1:51:40] <DarkKiores> No excuses
[1:51:40] <Gray_skies1993> this is true, you are doing okay
[1:51:41] <SophisticHades> chat is mean tonight
[1:51:41] <CurrySauseBandit> It's a good team if you just don't have the skills/this dungeon is shit for jester/
[1:51:41] <Punisher7771> its basic biology
[1:51:42] <Zunopiedra09> Has he beat the first boss yet?
[1:51:43] <ValKilmersCareer> I miss anything good?
[1:51:43] <MrTickleTrunk> @AngriestPat You'll learn :) You'll get it. Keep it up <3
[1:51:44] <%ThePuddingDead> you think DD cares if you DIDNT KNOW!?
[1:51:46] <a_mad_dragon> you don't get good team compositions until you can unlock all their skills
[1:51:46] <+blastazoid26> BIG stress
[1:51:49] <%simulationbard> shieldbreaker works best in a party where she can shuffle around
[1:51:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> blind
[1:51:53] <%dave323dave> YEYEYE
[1:51:54] <televisedrevolt> AMBUSH
[1:51:55] <%SpamKingRathalos> SKELETON WARRIORS
[1:51:56] <CurrySauseBandit> Wow that sentence. o3o
[1:51:57] <Piratedude12> yeyeye
[1:51:57] <splatinum129> KILL TEMPTING BASTARDS
[1:51:59] <admiral_of_crunch> @AngriestPat Yo check out those skeletons that have 200% bleed resistance how you gonna make your Jester bleed anyone?
[1:51:59] <%AirlineFood74> AMBUSH
[1:51:59] <%graffitisamurai> Try musketeer later
[1:52:00] <gsoto83> Its go time
[1:52:00] <CrimsonFox777> You think enemies just stay in the same spot all day?
[1:52:02] <%simulationbard> Fights can repop
[1:52:03] <Piratedude12> their baaaack
[1:52:03] <Finakala> This is why backtracking causes stress
[1:52:04] <gunstar73> Heal more pat your playing way to risky
[1:52:04] <televisedrevolt> GIT SPOOKED
[1:52:04] <+dodge_and_dust> you can get attacked while going through known areas
[1:52:05] <%AncelDeLambert> spooky scary skeletons send shivers down Pat's spine!
[1:52:12] <%The_UnfathoMarble> @skylerpilot nah it doesn't fortunately/unfortunatly
[1:52:17] <dekkitout> and suddenly- skeletons!
[1:52:21] <+solotheloso> Remember that buffs stack!
[1:52:23] <%trnzero> DANCE MONKEY
[1:52:26] <+solotheloso> You can do it!
[1:52:29] <%laserbeaming> If you built the Man-at-Arms for position 4, the Occultist for 2 and grabbed finale and solo on the Jester it could work
[1:52:41] <+Cadwae> Quit trying to bleed the skels
[1:52:48] <Nighthawkmun> So i havent played DD outside of the first mission, hoping to learn wtf to do from this stream
[1:52:49] <pigeontactician> i'm just waiting for the bleed heal to happen
[1:52:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Jester "welcome to hell! AAHAHAHAAA!
[1:52:53] <%dreadxvi> apatSmug apatSmug apatSmug
[1:52:53] <$thebonebard> my god this team just aint got time to bleed
[1:52:53] <Piratedude12> buff or finale as jester
[1:52:58] <luckysteak> nice
[1:53:00] <reonome> nice
[1:53:00] <axelcezar> this snake lady is op damn
[1:53:03] <+NameInsertable> This is why you don't bring jester to ruins
[1:53:11] <Piratedude12> ^^
[1:53:12] <admiral_of_crunch> Man At Arms is carrying
[1:53:13] <+skylerpilot> @The_UnfathoMarble yeah thats what I thought, Pat seems to think it is a taunt / semi taunt of sorts though. Was just bringing it up because I thought it only drew the attacks of enemies with + to marked
[1:53:13] <Gray_skies1993> nice
[1:53:24] <luckysteak> Buffs for the buff god!
[1:53:27] <arcaderabbit48> @axelcezar She has a very big drawback that we probably will not see tonight
[1:53:31] <GeneralHysterics> buffboi
[1:53:32] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat The Occultist's Pull skill is great for the backliners like the goblet dudes and the crossbow guys, because they cant use their big attacks from the front row.
[1:53:33] <splatinum129> jesters prefer killing pig dudes and mushroom people, not skeletons and fish
[1:53:35] <lionmanguy> Oh
[1:53:37] <gunstar73> Now use a turn to heal
[1:53:38] <nutimik> he doesn't have any stuns, probably the biggest problem in this comp
[1:53:38] <chancho4tierra> that was a textbook fight Pat
[1:53:40] <%dreadxvi> !discord
[1:53:42] <+Cadwae> @AngriestPat there is a button above map to put your party in default order
[1:53:47] <+solotheloso> Since attacks and such are basically just percentage rolls, enough Jester Ballad stacking can mean you have close to a 30% better chance to dodge.
[1:53:50] <axelcezar> @arcaderabbit48 she is dlc right? i hadn't got that
[1:53:50] <Piratedude12> Man at Arms crushes the skeletons with FACTS and LOGIC
[1:53:50] <lionmanguy> Damn I always that that was 'Foolish horrors' not 'Ghoulish horrors'
[1:53:54] <admiral_of_crunch> Oh shit Pat doesn't have any stuns?
[1:53:54] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Also pat, that redo button above the map button on the right will set ur chars starting positions
[1:53:57] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Let them eat cake!
[1:54:03] <%Niney_Who> "Squish"

[1:54:32] <arcaderabbit48> @axelcezar Yeah. When you camp with her, she goes crazy and conjures up a horde of demon snakes that your party has to fight. They give great loot, but they also do a lot of stress damage.

[1:54:42] <captainthunderwolf> @laserbeaming It went from, "Fuck, that's crazy," to "Fuck, that's alright." There's a Town Building that brings it to around pre-nerf damage, though.

[1:55:51] <%nofestu2> commence the intercourse ritual, prepare the sacrifice.
[1:55:52] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat The buff skill on the Shieldbreaker, Serpent Sway, gives her two stacks of Block, a status that completely negates a hit of physical damage.

[1:57:31] <captainthunderwolf> Anyone else notice the cloud of gunsmoke that comes out of the Skeleton's arbalest when he misses?
[1:57:33] <Paradocks23> People do things other than stress heal with Jester? My mind is blown.

[2:04:17] <%ThePuddingDead> super 3
[2:04:18] <%AirlineFood74> Wort it
[2:04:18] <+Nomicro4u> would be better spent on keeping good quirks imho
[2:04:18] <ShichiNoBushi> It needs to be removed twice, actually.
[2:04:19] <%SpamKingRathalos> unless its cheaper on radiant
[2:04:20] <mr_slaide> If you leave a bad Quirk on too long, it becomes locked and becomes expensive to remove.
[2:04:20] <+dodge_and_dust> more money not irmovable. whoops
[2:04:20] <nutimik> Worth
[2:04:21] <chancho4tierra> not worth it
[2:04:21] <%Niney_Who> Worth it tbh
[2:04:22] <%dimeybot> Worth it, Crusader is a solid all rounder later on, esp Ruins
[2:04:22] <+NameInsertable> that's not as bad as I thought it would be
[2:04:24] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat it is really not worth it, you are better off getting a different crusader
[2:04:25] <gunstar73> He‚Äôs only lvl 1 it‚Äôs not worth
[2:04:25] <Greetings_Gentlemen> get a new one, this one broken
[2:04:26] <chancho4tierra> just kill him
[2:04:27] <%reddpop_> Chat is batting 1000 tonight
[2:04:27] <nutimik> No fuck that, keep Reynauld
[2:04:29] <axelcezar> maaybe a light upgrade first to reduce cost?
[2:04:31] <laguerrilha> Put her out of misery
[2:04:33] <DarkKiores> get a new crusader

[2:04:39] <%Niney_Who> Does not take 2
[2:04:39] <%simulationbard> No it doesn't

[2:04:40] <SulfurousAcid> 3
[2:04:40] <RyuuAoi> WWWD?
[2:04:43] <nutimik> Don't dump Reynauld!
[2:04:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> They changed it LUL Crazy Talk is an area of effect
[2:04:44] <+dodge_and_dust> probably worth it to get a new one at this point yeah
[2:04:46] <Run44forrest> whys groulert freaking out

[2:05:07] <%dimeybot> Another Highwayman! Get both on Point Blank Shot and Gatling Gun technique it
[2:05:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Got a man and pupper.
[2:05:12] <$thebonebard> FUCKING LIES CHAT

[2:05:14] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat It just costs more for chronic Traits. It doesn't have to be done twice.
[2:05:15] <mr_slaide> Kirito is the protagonist.
[2:05:16] <lokiluko> bet then you can't get that one achievment for having him and the rouge survive until final boss
[2:05:18] <%graffitisamurai> Chat have you even played

[2:05:28] <SulfurousAcid> Don't believe chat's lies @AngriestPat
[2:05:33] <MrTickleTrunk> Upgrading only costs Heirlooms
[2:05:34] <lotharrio> FrankerZ
[2:05:34] <nutimik> just stumble around
[2:05:36] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat first raise your lvl 0's to 1 at least
[2:05:36] <+unknowingchuck> find a core group too use
[2:05:37] <@Pandora_Prime> Early on focus on upgrading buildings.
[2:05:37] <%Keyd00d> play game
[2:05:38] <%dimeybot> Upgrade the Meatwagon first
[2:05:39] <skullnaught> Carriage
[2:05:40] <%Mr_Strut> You have to keep reynauld and dismas to get the true ending
[2:05:41] <MrTickleTrunk> Focus on stuff that makes money go farther for you
[2:05:43] <luckysteak> upgrade weapons/armor first, then skills
[2:05:43] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Always focus on equipment, then skills. So blacksmith, then guild, other buildings are secondary.
[2:05:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatJpeg ghettoThorin ghettoAkari
[2:05:45] <+Gohyakuen> coach guild and blacksmith
[2:05:46] <%dave323dave> wtf name is that ?
[2:05:47] <%Keyd00d> PLUCKNET
[2:05:47] <RyuuAoi> Grind
[2:05:48] <+ArgCooper> Watching both Woolie and Pat's stream and pretending they're together :,)
[2:05:48] <%SpamKingRathalos> normally, the sanitarium is the first place to max.
[2:05:49] <TranquilTurnip> Mr. Plinkette
[2:05:50] <Zebroneath> Focus on stage coach first, then focus on weapon/armor and skills.
[2:05:50] <nutimik> Upgrade Guild and Blacksmith
[2:05:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mr Plinkett
[2:05:53] <dekkitout> mr plucknte
[2:05:54] <Finakala> What kind of name is PLUCKNET?
[2:05:56] <RyuuAoi> Get BIG
[2:05:59] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> What a beautiful name VoHiYo
[2:06:00] <Jaysky> It's not worth removing klepto, but hey if you want to save that crusader then so be it
[2:06:00] <%dimeybot> @angriestpat Upgrade the meatwagon
[2:06:00] <+Haarute> Check the Jester's character info. He's diseased.
[2:06:01] <TyrannosaurusMaximus> Upgrade guild
[2:06:08] <Piratedude12> you can get rid of hysterical blindness
[2:06:09] <%ThePuddingDead> stagecoach FIRST
[2:06:09] <+God_damnit_why> Chat is just being chat, keep the boy he's a starter. There's even a achievement for keeping him and dissmas around till the Mannor.
[2:06:10] <mr_slaide> Carriage > Weapons > Skills > Armor > Sanitarium
[2:06:10] <luckysteak> barracks are also necessary
[2:06:11] <skullnaught> yes
[2:06:12] <%reddpop_> @dave323dave what kind of name is dave 323dave?
[2:06:13] <CalmLikeAROM> Do it
[2:06:16] <%ThePuddingDead> barracks 1 network 2
[2:06:17] <MrTickleTrunk> Guild 1st to lvl 1
[2:06:19] <axelcezar> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GODS
[2:06:20] <IminyourBase> do everything
[2:06:20] <gsoto83> Thats a good upgrade
[2:06:21] <Piratedude12> do it
[2:06:22] <Mnightshyamallama> that is not a bad idea
[2:06:23] <%trnzero> save for experienced recruits i say
[2:06:32] <$thebonebard> @AngriestPat why is it a problem to give people names, there was a pencil icon right there next to the name
[2:06:33] <ValKilmersCareer> Upgrade man.
[2:06:36] <nutimik> So you can give people decent skills
[2:06:39] <+Gohyakuen> upgrade and buy skills
[2:06:40] <gunstar73> Get more hero space man
[2:06:40] <Piratedude12> suicide machine build
[2:06:43] <%SpamKingRathalos> This game is quite literally quirk management.
[2:06:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> FBBlock apatJpeg
[2:06:47] <%reddpop_> Drag a hero in
[2:06:49] <Piratedude12> more hero space
[2:06:50] <gsoto83> Then focus on the stress releavers like the bar and chapel
[2:06:54] <MrTickleTrunk> Training Regimen is good
[2:06:55] <egevege1> stagecoach is the first thing you should upgrade @AngriestPat
[2:06:56] <mr_slaide> Allows to increase your skills so they're more efficient.
[2:06:57] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Crazy Talk on my part, Stagecoach is absolutely #1. Big thing is, you can heal Stress in battle and most Quirks don't become huge problems. Guild lets you buy and upgrade skills, and equipment from the Blacksmith determine stats, so those two are huge.
[2:06:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DOG
[2:06:59] <MrTickleTrunk> to get lvl up
[2:07:04] <IminyourBase> we should teach pat no torch runs LUL

[2:07:05] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat there really aren't many bad things to upgrade in this game
[2:07:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Purchase skills
[2:07:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @thebonebard takes too long, and Pat's not doing 1st come 1st serve apparently
[2:07:12] <MrTickleTrunk> Natural Swing OP
[2:07:22] <mr_slaide> Natural swing = great
[2:07:22] <%ThePuddingDead> Claustrophobia just means he cant interact with iron maidens @AngriestPat
[2:07:22] <TyrannosaurusMaximus> Agreed @Mnightshyamallama
[2:07:24] <Piratedude12> he noticed me :O

[2:07:53] <@Moobot> THAT'S IT! http://bit.ly/2iKTj5v
[2:07:53] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> stage coach then guild and blacksmith
[2:07:54] <smallboops> stage coach prevents soft locking
[2:07:54] <axelcezar> obviously, the core concept of the game is losing heroes, so you need more, and higher level
[2:07:54] <+Jubelaious> is the stream frozen, or is Pat just reading very slowly?
[2:07:55] <%graffitisamurai> Smart
[2:07:55] <dekkitout> upgrade the death sentenc- i err, i mean stagecoat
[2:08:03] <Jaysky> God the narrator is so good
[2:08:07] <Piratedude12> stagecoach then skill shops

[2:08:16] <luckysteak> yep
[2:08:21] <%dreadxvi> how 2 access pat discord for memes
[2:08:21] <captainthunderwolf> Yes.
[2:08:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mhm
[2:08:22] <%dimeybot> Rarely
[2:08:26] <Valdorick> Then you just throw level 1 chumps into the meat grinder
[2:08:26] <%Kduff89> does he know that his jester is diseased?
[2:08:30] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat get a full bounty hunter team for maximum *snort*
[2:08:30] <%ThePuddingDead> not quite
[2:08:31] <%Mr_Strut> not exactly
[2:08:31] <Intolerable> Occasionally
[2:08:32] <luckysteak> not quite like that
[2:08:34] <Piratedude12> heal jester
[2:08:34] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Keep the level 1s, but yeah.
[2:08:35] <HazedNConfused> you have a chance to get level 1s, 0s do still show up
[2:08:35] <%commanderclaw> Go full meat grinder
[2:08:36] <ValKilmersCareer> yeah pretty much
[2:08:38] <+Haarute> I don't think he saw the disease tab.
[2:08:40] <foreverN2dust> You should meat grind eyeyeye
[2:08:40] <+God_damnit_why> That one comes with a FANTASTIC highwayman build pre done for you. You activate repost on the first round setting you up for the point blank on the second round
[2:08:40] <axelcezar> yep, just push them all into the meatgrinder
[2:08:41] <Paradocks23> Upgrade stagecoach until you get 4 people each weak.
[2:08:41] <MrTickleTrunk> not if some are good
[2:08:44] <IminyourBase> now you're thinking with slavery
[2:08:49] <Jaysky> The disease on the jester doesn't matter unless he's stressed above 75
[2:08:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> into the MEATGRINDER
[2:08:50] <luckysteak> yes
[2:08:50] <%Mr_Strut> Treat your heroes like retail employees

[2:13:36] <+LookBeyondYou> 5

[2:13:36] <+silencieux7> Wash hands rn
[2:13:37] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> 2
[2:13:38] <One_Seven_One> I think five is the max
[2:13:38] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Five is max, then they rotate each other out. For good and ad.
[2:13:38] <lionmanguy> Yes
[2:13:38] <Intolerable> 5
[2:13:38] <ScrubTheNerd> You can have 5
[2:13:39] <Piratedude12> yes
[2:13:39] <%klutch02> 5 yes
[2:13:40] <cayvalentine> 5 max
[2:13:40] <%trnzero> but they can be traded w/ a new one
[2:13:41] <%galaxyswirl> 1
[2:13:41] <RyuuAoi> Proof
[2:13:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> 5 good 5 bad

[2:13:42] <+silencieux7> 5
[2:13:43] <leole11> 5 bad quirks
[2:13:44] <dekkitout> 5?
[2:13:44] <stabbityrabbit> @Paradocks23 I mostly feel bad for they hypothetical beast.
[2:13:44] <Paradocks23> They'll sometimes get replaced by yes.
[2:13:45] <%The_UnfathoMarble> and then it cycle
[2:13:45] <Fujiwara_92> 5 of each
[2:13:46] <%Skrypto> Im too distracted by all the piss
[2:13:47] <%Mr_Strut> 5 quirks of each type
[2:13:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah it's like five
[2:13:48] <Piratedude12> then they star overwriting each other
[2:13:48] <%FramedMonkey> 5
[2:13:48] <%simulationbard> 5 is max then they'll start getting replaced
[2:13:48] <%graffitisamurai> 5 good 5 bad
[2:13:48] <Gray_skies1993> 5 negative, 5 positive
[2:13:48] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat Yes, max for good/bad traits is five of each
[2:13:50] <+Nomicro4u> They get replaced after 5 both good and bad
[2:13:50] <adamisfruit> The batter gestates
[2:13:51] <laguerrilha> Not that bad as negatives
[2:13:52] <dekkitout> thats a lotta damage
[2:13:52] <+DukeMoose> they max on both positive and negative, in that they can be replaced without your input. Including your positive ones
[2:13:52] <%The_UnfathoMarble> yeah
[2:13:53] <%dimeybot> Try to lock in the negatives that don't matter too bad,
[2:13:54] <waifoong98> He wash his hands with his shorts chat Kappa
[2:13:54] <One_Seven_One> Five on both sides
[2:13:55] <cayvalentine> lock in the 5 least bad
[2:13:55] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat but they can switch out sometimes
[2:13:56] <Endocrom> They can replace negative stats unless they get locked in
[2:13:57] <+Badgerconda_> they max out, but they can be replaced by new ones unless they get locked in.
[2:13:57] <mr_slaide> You want to lock in the not so bad ones.
[2:13:59] <%DomunDomunDomun> New ones replace old ones when it's full. Ones with a skull don't get replaced.
[2:13:59] <stabbityrabbit> That much neuroticism can't end well.
[2:13:59] <gunstar73> Yes but they can be overwritten
[2:14:01] <%trnzero> 5 of each
[2:14:02] <%Superstarsage> you can lock them in
[2:14:02] <%The_UnfathoMarble> unless they get permanent
[2:14:02] <lionmanguy> Give them bad quirks that don't really matter, yeah
[2:14:03] <Belasteris> after 5 they get overwritten
[2:14:04] <leinadtonu> WHY DID YOU SPIT on YOUR HANDS PAT!
[2:14:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Get all of the worst ones
[2:14:05] <cayvalentine> or just ignore it and theyll rotate out
[2:14:06] <Intolerable> New replsces old
[2:14:08] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> you can
[2:14:09] <luckysteak> that can kind of happen
[2:14:10] <Piratedude12> you can lock good perks tho
[2:14:10] <leole11> you can
[2:14:11] <adjothetiger> you can lock them in yes
[2:14:11] <chancho4tierra> the new one replaces the old one, you can lock the bad and good ones
[2:14:12] <%AirlineFood74> YOU CAN
[2:14:12] <strezof> piss hands on piss lap
[2:14:13] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Bad Quirks replace other bad Quirks, good do the same. You CAN lock them in at the Sanitatrium
[2:14:13] <%skizzuto> you can pay to lock in the ones you wan
[2:14:13] <lionmanguy> The permenent ones don't rotate as easily
[2:14:13] <CrimsonFox777> I believe a max of 3 can get locked in.
[2:14:13] <%Nobrev> 5 of each
[2:14:13] <gsoto83> You can lock them in, at the sanaterium
[2:14:15] <%dimeybot> Yes they'll lock in over time
[2:14:15] <lionmanguy> Yes you can do that
[2:14:16] <mr_slaide> Yop. Sanitarium.
[2:14:17] <$cureneckbeard> Pat go the fuck back and wash your hands
[2:14:20] <One_Seven_One> They can become permanent if you don't fix them
[2:14:20] <+dudecool61> You can but that‚Äôs hella expensive
[2:14:21] <Jaysky> Costs a lot though
[2:14:21] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat You can absolutely lock in quirks
[2:14:22] <+Ell1ot> new one kick out old one. you can lock in good perks
[2:14:23] <lionmanguy> Lock GOOD ONES in, not bad ones
[2:14:24] <%FramedMonkey> you can
[2:14:24] <Ultrasir9000> You need to ditch party members that are lost causes
[2:14:25] <dekkitout> so youre trying to min max with quirks then
[2:14:25] <blankwaffle> lavate los manos
[2:14:25] <gsoto83> But that costs MUCHO GRANDE!
[2:14:27] <+imporia_> that would be so nice in real life "oh thank god I gave myself ADD, now I'm safe from schizophrenia"
[2:14:29] <lionmanguy> The bad ones lock in all on their own
[2:14:30] <Zebroneath> You can only manually lock in good quirks
[2:14:31] <mr_slaide> Its fantastic
[2:14:33] <cayvalentine> The sanitarium can lock in both positive and negative traits, but is very expensive.
[2:14:33] <chancho4tierra> he is
[2:14:33] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> it is
[2:14:38] <SulfurousAcid> gonna heal that jester?
[2:14:40] <Finakala> Shiny Luminous?
[2:14:42] <%simulationbard> You can't lock in negative quirks, they do it on their own
[2:14:46] <Piratedude12> heal jester
[2:14:51] <%AirlineFood74> kill jestah
[2:14:52] <Paradocks23> Meat grinder duty.
[2:14:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Except you're Luminous and light sensitive which seems like a bad combination.
[2:14:57] <+silencieux7> PokWeavile
[2:14:57] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat positive quirks can be manually locked in and negitive quirks get locked in over time
[2:15:00] <STFUChris94> Jester for life
[2:15:04] <adamisfruit> Heal mr. J
[2:15:06] <SulfurousAcid> @AngriestPat will you heal jester or he stay diseased?
[2:15:06] <mr_slaide> Locking in is very, very expensive. As is removing quirks that are locked in.
[2:15:07] <%FramedMonkey> stop
[2:15:08] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat get rank two skills
[2:15:21] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Honestly, Quirks stop being worth worrying about after a time. What really matters is, everyone's gonna max out on both as time goes on, so just lock in the good ones you like on the characters you use often. Having five of both is a nigh-on inevitability.
[2:15:32] <Piratedude12> @AngriestPat Jester has blindness
[2:15:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> One day you'll make progress
[2:15:33] <admiral_of_crunch> @AngriestPat There are a couple really special traits that you'll know are worth locking in when you see them.
[2:15:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> convert LUL
[2:15:54] <$cureneckbeard> The Free Real Estate
[2:15:54] <captainthunderwolf> @admiral_of_crunch And you get them from fighting total assholes sometimes!
[2:15:54] <+mgskomododragon> oh no. vitalis is diseased
[2:16:01] <gunstar73> Unlock all skills for the party your gonna use @angriestpat
[2:16:01] <luckysteak> choose your next party, and then upgrade skills! that is the best way to do it in my experience
[2:16:02] <admiral_of_crunch> SHIELD BASH
[2:16:05] <Paradocks23> Level up skills.
[2:16:07] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat convert heirlooms into deeds
[2:16:10] <buffmurffy> you should upgrade the person you're bringing in next
[2:16:11] <%skizzuto> sanitarium

[2:16:31] <Jaysky> The disease isn't bad Pat
[2:16:35] <Endocrom> Remember that bad exchange from last time?
[2:16:40] <admiral_of_crunch> No, don't convert your heirlooms. The conversion rate is shit
[2:16:40] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Bear in mind, skill upgrades are usually Accuracy and such, a character's raw damage only increases when you upgrade them at the Blacksmith.
[2:16:47] <SulfurousAcid> YAY
[2:16:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:16:50] <admiral_of_crunch> OKAY
[2:16:54] <%QueequegTheater> gdi pat
[2:16:54] <+DukeMoose> hes a lvl 1!
[2:16:56] <%FramedMonkey> y
[2:16:56] <Piratedude12> *whistles*
[2:16:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Don't convert heirlooms. The exchange rate is terrible.
[2:16:57] <Jaysky> He only had 2 positive quirks
[2:16:58] <%AirlineFood74> SYRINGE
[2:17:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Worth it in the long run
[2:17:01] <chancho4tierra> what a waste
[2:17:01] <laguerrilha> Cheaper to get another guy
[2:17:01] <TranquilTurnip> Its a fair enough thing
[2:17:03] <pigeontactician> a training arc for one of the main characters!
[2:17:04] <Sinister_Aglet> pat suddenly hates crimes
[2:17:05] <gunstar73> Literally a waste
[2:17:08] <WaterDragon68> Meat GrINDER
[2:17:08] <nobody12349> Kleptomania doesn't like you Pat
[2:17:12] <waifoong98> But meatgrind them tho
[2:17:13] <+MechaBaphomet> Oh no
[2:17:15] <TranquilTurnip> Pat hates crime when its happening to him\
[2:17:15] <%AncelDeLambert> awww, but I like sausage
[2:17:15] <leinadtonu> would not recommend converting
[2:17:16] <Ultrasir9000> Reynauld still the best.
[2:17:17] <Jaysky> Watch him come back and die next quest
[2:17:19] <%QueequegTheater> Your fucking OCD is going to add 30 hours to your playthrough
[2:17:20] <admiral_of_crunch> Now work with your mysterious amount of money that we can't see over your camera
[2:17:22] <gunstar73> Your gonna get a million recruits
[2:17:25] <waifoong98> they are all DISPOSABLE LUL
[2:17:32] <%FramedMonkey> watch it come back
[2:17:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Reabuu
[2:17:35] <captainthunderwolf> Fun fact, the canon behind Reynauld and Dismas is actually pretty fucked.
[2:17:38] <Endocrom> Fix it with leeches!
[2:17:39] <TranquilTurnip> Raynauld and Dismas are the only NOT disposable ones
[2:17:40] <%AirlineFood74> Reaboo
[2:17:42] <$TRILLTURBAN> reboot?
[2:17:43] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat can you move the cam so we can see your money
[2:17:44] <The_Blumper> Pray to JESUS
[2:17:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Let's all go to the lobby
[2:17:45] <DrMoose7> gang gang
[2:17:49] <Piratedude12> Dismas shot some people
[2:17:49] <gunstar73> Think of them as filth sent to the gallows pat
[2:17:51] <admiral_of_crunch> Playing Darkest Dungeon with OCD is FUCKING AMAZING. Files last for hundreds of hours
[2:17:52] <mr_slaide> DO NOT GO
[2:17:53] <skullnaught> @angriestpat Pat treat the characters as tools that is the most efficient way to clear dungeons cheap
[2:17:53] <Mnightshyamallama> don't do that yet
[2:17:53] <%AirlineFood74> Bikie gang
[2:17:53] <%without_borders> Pat, some Plaguemasters have a camping skill that removes diseases free
[2:17:54] <count_bob> "Fun"
[2:17:54] <Zebroneath> We don't have the time for all this meat grinding.
[2:17:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:17:56] <admiral_of_crunch> Nope
[2:17:56] <pigeontactician> do it you coward

[2:18:00] <%SpamKingRathalos> Don't DO IT
[2:18:02] <Fabric_tester> Nope
[2:18:02] <Piratedude12> DO IT
[2:18:03] <SulfurousAcid> then do something else
[2:18:04] <captainthunderwolf> @Piratedude12 Yeah, Reynauld's fucking wife and kid. WHOOPSIE
[2:18:05] <%simulationbard> so don't
[2:18:05] <Elpolloelastico> do it
[2:18:07] <waifoong98> DEW it
[2:18:08] <chromerazor> you got this
[2:18:08] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat on the highway man check out Duelist Advance and Pointblank Shot
[2:18:08] <%sleepy_coffee> but that garlic though
[2:18:10] <Elpolloelastico> meatgrind
[2:18:11] <Videogamer4> D O I T
[2:18:13] <%AncelDeLambert> sheeeeit, ain't nobody got time for that
[2:18:13] <lokiluko> first incarnation of ruin boss is a joke
[2:18:15] <mr_slaide> Do not go.
[2:18:15] <SulfurousAcid> DO something ELSE
[2:18:17] <%AirlineFood74> FARMSTEAD
[2:18:17] <Piratedude12> @captainthunderwolf OH NO
[2:18:18] <lokiluko> go nuts
[2:18:20] <admiral_of_crunch> Don't even think about that boss
[2:18:21] <mr_slaide> Don't listen to those idiots.
[2:18:21] <JJMR322> fight the boss you coward
[2:18:21] <CrimsonFox777> On the one hand, you should upgrade your adventurers before you fight the boss.
[2:18:23] <Videogamer4> COWARD
[2:18:24] <buffmurffy> 5 deeds!
[2:18:25] <%AirlineFood74> GO to Plague's farm!
[2:18:25] <$thebonebard> that boss going to make shakas walls fall
[2:18:25] <%QueequegTheater> cheer100 Pat, you need to learn to ignore the negative quirks on any heroes beneath level 4. Spending 5000 gold on a level 1 is unconscionably insane. Your OCD is going to add 30+ hours to your playthrough
[2:18:27] <Ultrasir9000> @angriestpat how's Canadian winter going?
[2:18:28] <ValKilmersCareer> You can do that boss Whats the worst that could happen?
[2:18:28] <%ThePuddingDead> @captainthunderwolf OH MY GOD, I just realized what you meant!
[2:18:30] <CrimsonFox777> On the other hand............DO IT YOU COWARD.
[2:18:35] <chancho4tierra> take your time, go in a deed mision
[2:18:40] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ValKilmersCareer) (warning)
[2:18:40] <captainthunderwolf> @Piratedude12 Grapeshot Blast is now a very dark skill.
[2:18:41] <Rincewind1998> That's the combo right there
[2:18:42] <+Ell1ot> if you over level your dudes, they wont do low level dungeons
[2:18:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat hasn't gone on a quest longer than Short, yet.
[2:18:46] <luckysteak> @AngriestPat point blank shot is great with duelist advance
[2:18:48] <Zebroneath> Medium dungeons are safer than short dungeons cause of heals at camp.
[2:18:51] <admiral_of_crunch> Highwaymen are beasts
[2:18:51] <%simulationbard> Nerco apprentice isn't that hard as far as bosses go, but better to be overprepared then under prepared
[2:18:54] <Sparty9112> Has anyone been horribly murdered yet?
[2:18:55] <skullnaught> a level one is expendable
[2:18:56] <xxgoth_holicxx> yeah go for it

[2:19:16] <xxgoth_holicxx> Atta boy
[2:19:17] <%without_borders> @AngriestPat some plague doctors get a camping skill that will remove diseases from an ally for free
[2:19:18] <+DukeMoose> you only need to Explore 90, youll be fine
[2:19:18] <pigeontactician> he has a dog
[2:19:18] <gunstar73> You have no money
[2:19:19] <TranquilTurnip> Duelist advance into pointblank shot can be one of the best combos its so fun
[2:19:19] <Tgsnum5> Not with level zeros, no lol
[2:19:19] <+Meiou> pat lets be honest are you truely ever ready for anything?
[2:19:20] <leinadtonu> oof

[2:19:27] <+flillycake> Sure fuck it
[2:19:27] <%ElenaManetta> You can leave a dungeon any time you want
[2:19:28] <lokiluko> i never do any short runs at all, not worth the loss in gold/relics for the week, always medium or longer
[2:19:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> you'll be fine with a healer
[2:19:32] <ShichiNoBushi> Pet the doggo.
[2:19:32] <Ultrasir9000> medium is only the length. lvl is all that rly matters
[2:19:32] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat Houndmaster is a back row class
[2:19:33] <@Pandora_Prime> Doggoman
[2:19:34] <waifoong98> riPepperonis
[2:19:34] <%AirlineFood74> RIP 0's LUL
[2:19:35] <%SpamKingRathalos> That stress heal is really fucking good
[2:19:36] <laguerrilha> Welp 4 more graves
[2:19:36] <$thebonebard> stress heal gets really good if you upgrade
[2:19:37] <captainthunderwolf> @ThePuddingDead Yeah, and Dismas is the penitent thief from the Bible. Reynauld and Dismas' characters are, "I feel bad about abandoning my family, I hope they're okay," and, "Oh FUCK I killed his family as they came here to find him."
[2:19:39] <CrimsonFox777> LUL
[2:19:42] <+Ell1ot> stress healing is great
[2:19:43] <luckysteak> houndmaster is better in places with LIVING enemies
[2:19:47] <TranquilTurnip> We're a bunch of losers
[2:19:48] <admiral_of_crunch> Then don't do medium yet
[2:19:48] <GeneralHysterics> doesn't think stress heal is good, lol
[2:19:48] <deathscythe122887> @angriestpat hey did you get the pop team epic skin for the occultist
[2:19:50] <lotharrio> Zero to hero.
[2:19:50] <Piratedude12> anywhere except rank 1 for JPEG DOG
[2:19:52] <%QueequegTheater> cheer700 In case my other donation was too small to get read. Pat, you need to learn to ignore the negative quirks on any heroes beneath level 4. Spending 5000 gold on a level 1 is unconscionably insane. Your OCD is going to add 30+ hours to your playthrough
[2:19:53] <%graffitisamurai> Musketeer
[2:19:55] <mr_slaide> Hound master is bad in ruins (skeletons don't bleed).
[2:19:57] <%AirlineFood74> Then do a different mission
[2:19:57] <%Sephrim> Tank dog
[2:19:59] <+DukeMoose> dog needs at least spot 2
[2:20:00] <+Badgerconda_> WOOF
[2:20:06] <admiral_of_crunch> You should take a look at the locked skills too.
[2:20:07] <dekkitout> the bork IS the buster
[2:20:07] <%Tman451> apatJpeg

[2:20:15] <CobaltLounge> The hound was meh when I played it
[2:20:16] <%simulationbard> Doggy is the best girl
[2:20:17] <%QueequegTheater> @Niney_Who Yes
[2:20:20] <Jaysky> Dog can be anywhere, but is better in 3-2 spot
[2:20:20] <+Emperor_Bad> remember you can unlock skills now
[2:20:26] <+bainblade> Bleed boi for ruins feelsgoodman
[2:20:30] <%AirlineFood74> S O F T
[2:20:33] <SpookySpaghooti> @Niney_Who yes
[2:20:34] <%Niney_Who> Swap dog and Vestal
[2:20:36] <SulfurousAcid> Big MACK
[2:20:36] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat take dismas instead
[2:20:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Niney_Who what's your record? Mine is 12
[2:20:45] <%AirlineFood74> Always Sunny
[2:20:45] <waifoong98> And they all get PTSD, nice job Kappa
[2:20:46] <captainthunderwolf> @CobaltLounge He's great in the Warrens, he gets huge damage buffs against Beasts. He's like the Crusader but for innocent animals.
[2:20:46] <admiral_of_crunch> Don't feel bad about pulling out, pat. Kappa
[2:20:49] <%Sephrim> @AngriestPat I would unlock all of the Houndmaster's skills
[2:20:52] <$thebonebard> i dont like this lack of tanking
[2:20:53] <%Mr_Strut> for sure
[2:20:54] <Piratedude12> bleed bois for ruins
[2:20:56] <Piratedude12> again
[2:20:57] <luckysteak> this is a good comp
[2:21:01] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat lvl 1 not 0
[2:21:02] <admiral_of_crunch> Dismas doesn't deserve this
[2:21:02] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> did peche die?
[2:21:02] <luckysteak> besides the houndmaster
[2:21:03] <GypsyMagi> @AngriestPat adder's kiss, i guess you never miss huh
[2:21:05] <Zebroneath> Dismas doesn't have point blank shot.
[2:21:08] <mr_slaide> Change the houndmaster (bad for ruins).
[2:21:09] <Jaysky> Houndmaster with dodge items = Dodgemaster
[2:21:09] <%trnzero> higher level, for each dungeon level above the characters, they start with more stress
[2:21:11] <%Niney_Who> @Sphincter_Spelunker It's not so much attacks as it is "I'm sick and the only bad part about it is that I feel like I have to sneeze 90% of the time and life is hell"
[2:21:11] <bananachode> just bring 4 crusaders and use their default attack every time
[2:21:12] <+Nomicro4u> touch Paige with foot fungus
[2:21:13] <%QueequegTheater> @egggggggggggggggggggggg New playthrough
[2:21:14] <Tgsnum5> Level Zeros start with 20 stress their first run, so Dismas isn't gonna just go fucking juts lol
[2:21:14] <laguerrilha> Its the foot mold
[2:21:15] <%AirlineFood74> Houndmaster in Ruins, level 0's in level 1 LUL
[2:21:15] <+DukeMoose> paige stop mentioning FEET
[2:21:16] <jordantheinternsm> Chat is he playing on radiant?
[2:21:17] <buffmurffy> team is good, but underleveled
[2:21:18] <+TheWallOfMeat> dude drop the houndmaster, he's awful against ruins
[2:21:20] <%Niney_Who> Switch around Vestal and Dog
[2:21:23] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat Don't do medium then
[2:21:26] <%patriotrenegade> Is Paige yelling in the background
[2:21:27] <%AirlineFood74> Do a different mission, they'll die
[2:21:28] <$thebonebard> dogman with bounty hunter is fucking strong
[2:21:29] <%simulationbard> Houndmaster does bleed which isn't great for ruins
[2:21:33] <CobaltLounge> @captainthunderwolf hmm Ill keep that in mind
[2:21:35] <gunstar73> Switch dog and vestal spot
[2:21:46] <%LupaTheWolf> thank you
[2:21:46] <person181> kinda
[2:21:46] <%QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[2:21:47] <+Ell1ot> did @PeachSaliva go in the oven instead of t he cake?
[2:21:47] <+bainblade> Pat undead have like 200 bleed resistence so the bleed boi might not be besy yeet yeet
[2:21:48] <%ElenaManetta> No
[2:21:48] <admiral_of_crunch> Ruins have 200% bleed resist skeletons, if your party has bleed attacks get them the fuck out
[2:21:49] <Piratedude12> Yes
[2:21:50] <%Keyd00d> yes
[2:21:51] <Sparty9112> yes dungeons sorta level up.
[2:21:51] <%ElenaManetta> It's just more fights
[2:21:52] <%AirlineFood74> YES
[2:21:53] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat There are level 0 characters but lowest dungeons are level 1, so freshies always get the imediate Stress bonus.
[2:21:53] <Elpolloelastico> yes
[2:21:54] <Fujiwara_92> yes
[2:21:54] <SulfurousAcid> YEs
[2:21:54] <%Niney_Who> Yes kinda
[2:21:55] <Jaysky> Yes he's on radiant
[2:21:56] <%The_UnfathoMarble> The whole zone does
[2:21:58] <%ElenaManetta> The green is still the same levels, it's just more to fight
[2:21:59] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat yes, that is why it says apprentice lvl1
[2:21:59] <gunstar73> Yes
[2:22:00] <Fabric_tester> kinda
[2:22:01] <%trnzero> the 2 with the skull
[2:22:01] <%dmdyne99> Swap vestal and dog
[2:22:03] <bananachode> 4 CRUSADERS
[2:22:04] <+Nomicro4u> 1
[2:22:05] <%Taisuru> WHEN'S FORTNITE
[2:22:08] <cayvalentine> These people are giving you nonsense advice that only matters when your at level like 4-5
[2:22:09] <Zebroneath> As you do more quests for one area, there'll be more difficult quests and bosses will unlock.
[2:22:09] <%AirlineFood74> That number under the skull is the dungeon level
[2:22:11] <leinadtonu> At least Pat's foot doesn't MAKE him tell in climax/pain
[2:22:11] <Elpolloelastico> level 0,1, and 2 characters play in apprentice dungeons
[2:22:12] <%simulationbard> the dungeon is level 1, your heros are level zero so they get stressed
[2:22:15] <%CerberusDriver> Jump Force looks so bad
[2:22:18] <admiral_of_crunch> God dammit there're too many people in chat to coherently create a narrative for this complex-ass game
[2:22:22] <Jaysky> Guys, medium means length of dungeon. When it changes colors it means stronger characters needed
[2:22:24] <leinadtonu> yell
[2:22:25] <Tgsnum5> Sort of. The zone gets a bit harder the more you do missions there, yeah.
[2:22:26] <+Nanomachiner> i'm back butches
[2:22:27] <person181> bad idea
[2:22:28] <One_Seven_One> Jump Force looks like it was made in unity

[2:27:57] <egevege1> @AngriestPat yo pat listen taking bleed characters into ruins is not the wisest because skeletons dont have blood, you need to take blighters like the shieldbreaker u got there but highwayman and houndmaster are not the best picks here
[2:27:59] <admiral_of_crunch> You can just turn around but this works too

[2:30:20] <%simulationbard> The pages are worthless you guys are super wrong.
[2:30:21] <Rincewind1998> @Niney_Who no it's not, I've never played with mods and they totally are worth money
[2:30:26] <admiral_of_crunch> Wait you clowns are talking about mods?
[2:30:27] <%ThePuddingDead> the journal entries just help flesh out backstories of other heros that came before u, its just flavor, not worth money
[2:30:28] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat The notes each stop individually spawning when you take them - you don't get dupes if you end the mission with them in your inventory - and they spawn in place of gems usually. There's a finite amount of unique notes, so in the long run it's better to bear it and take them when possible.
[2:30:29] <silverglove2012> @the_unfathomarble I want to see that

[2:38:00] <@Pandora_Prime> you can go to other zones too
[2:38:01] <%VanaSkiller> OOPS all flagellants
[2:38:01] <%ThePuddingDead> practice with team comps, see what works, then at lvl 2 with weapons and moves, go for it
[2:38:01] <TranquilTurnip> Have you tried a flagellant? they're really fun
[2:38:02] <%Mr_Strut> Oops all flagellents
[2:38:06] <dekkitout> its a sign from the blud gawdz
[2:38:09] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> I always loved having an Abomination dood in my party, always freaking everyone out LUL
[2:38:11] <Jaysky> Medium is just the length of the dungeon. He'll learn how to camp, and learn about death.
[2:38:14] <waifoong98> JUST go GRIND moarrrr oldman LUL
[2:38:15] <UnderpaidBob> go to a different one yeah
[2:38:16] <Tgsnum5> Maybe try another zone at some point lol
[2:38:22] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat you are much better off going to one of the other places for now
[2:38:22] <admiral_of_crunch> You should use your flagellant, just not in the ruins or the cove
[2:38:23] <lionmanguy> Cove is rough
[2:38:25] <arcaderabbit48> Can Pat get a Flagellant if he doesnt have the DLC installed?
[2:38:25] <%ThePuddingDead> go cove
[2:38:27] <%ThePuddingDead> its fun
[2:38:27] <@Pandora_Prime> Warrens are weak to Bleeds
[2:38:28] <mr_slaide> Medium is same difficulty, just need to bring more supplies.
[2:38:29] <chancho4tierra> WEAPON AND ARMOR upgrade and boss time
[2:38:30] <+TheWallOfMeat> Just hit the Darkest Dungeon, duh.
[2:38:35] <%Agami23> farm stead
[2:38:36] <egevege1> @AngriestPat yo pat you shouldn't do just one area because you'll get hit with a lot of harder levels in other areas, mix and match, don't just run ruins
[2:38:36] <admiral_of_crunch> Cove is probably the meanest zone on average
[2:38:37] <@Pandora_Prime> Cove is strong vs Bleeds
[2:38:41] <+chrissycht> bring blight for cove
[2:38:44] <+chrissycht> and bleed heal
[2:38:47] <%trnzero> @arcaderabbit48 nope
[2:38:47] <Smaenus> @arcaderabbit48 I believe so, yeah
[2:38:50] <Tgsnum5> Cove is bad for bleed.
[2:38:52] <leinadtonu> Flagelants have a couple of interesting heals
[2:38:55] <admiral_of_crunch> Cove is mean, bring blight and heals
[2:38:58] <Jaysky> Cove is weak to toxic
[2:38:59] <%simulationbard> @arcaderabbit48 He has the DLC he just doenst have the Crimson Court area active
[2:39:03] <Jaysky> Err, blight
[2:39:05] <mr_slaide> Cove = Use blight characters.
[2:39:07] <+TheWallOfMeat> NO bleed, YES blight
[2:39:15] <egevege1> @AngriestPat full roster
[2:39:19] <%klutch02> You need and A team and a B team

[2:39:26] <@Pandora_Prime> Focus on upgrading buildings
[2:39:27] <pigeontactician> multiple teams is important
[2:39:28] <SiegeJay> @AngriestPat Get a rounded full roster
[2:39:33] <hntronium> Just an A team will get them fucked
[2:39:34] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Hit the boss. Use some scrubs to gague how tough it is.
[2:39:35] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat I think it is more worth it right now to get the materials you need to upgrade your places
[2:39:35] <admiral_of_crunch> Just take it slow. Build up your infrastructure before your guys
[2:39:36] <arcaderabbit48> And a C Team
[2:39:36] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat full roster but focus on certain people
[2:39:36] <TranquilTurnip> and a C and D team if possible

[2:40:03] <%trnzero> he do big blood
[2:40:03] <TranquilTurnip> Bring in the best boy PogChamp but not into the cove
[2:40:04] <+flillycake> Nothing in the cove bleeds
[2:40:05] <+TheWallOfMeat> Don't use bleed in cove
[2:40:05] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat If you bring him, don't go to the cove
[2:40:06] <admiral_of_crunch> He's god tier, but fuck you if you take him in there
[2:40:07] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> This is going to be good LUL
[2:40:09] <dekkitout> i noticing a pattern with this guy Kappa
[2:40:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> No bleed in cove
[2:40:15] <Sir_Naix> inb4 wipe
[2:40:15] <%dmdyne99> BLEED SUCKS IN COVE
[2:40:18] <%simulationbard> Cove enemies are have high bleed resist
[2:40:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Blood Magic
[2:40:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> 33333
[2:40:24] <Jaysky> Ooooh, then yeah, warrens he'd be good
[2:40:26] <admiral_of_crunch> Okay that's okay them
[2:40:26] <%trnzero> he wants to bleed
[2:40:27] <Ion_LaserX> 3
[2:40:27] <+Cavumentum> He can resist bleed
[2:40:27] <%simulationbard> Warrens is good for bleed
[2:40:27] <CrimsonFox777> Blood Magic
[2:40:28] <+Bupkis7> 3
[2:40:28] <+TheWallOfMeat> Because he whips himself, Pat
[2:40:28] <mr_slaide> Warrens = Bleed characters.
[2:40:28] <TranquilTurnip> He gives out and takes bleed
[2:40:28] <%Superstarsage> He heals someone else to bleed himself
[2:40:29] <arcaderabbit48> Because he lashes himself
[2:40:30] <luckysteak> he hurts himself
[2:40:30] <%Mr_Strut> Because he's a weirdo
[2:40:30] <@Pandora_Prime> He bleeds and Regens others
[2:40:30] <%ThePuddingDead> he's....fleggelant...
[2:40:31] <Finakala> That's literally what flagellants DO, Pat
[2:40:33] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat he gets stronk when he bleeds
[2:40:34] <admiral_of_crunch> Because he cuts himself
[2:40:37] <Jaysky> Cause he wants to bleed cause he's a cutie
[2:40:37] <Tucker0603> he's a crazy man
[2:40:37] <%simulationbard> Cause he uses blood magic
[2:40:38] <Endocrom> Do you know what flagelation is?
[2:40:38] <hntronium> Cause he's a flagellant
[2:40:38] <SiegeJay> @AngriestPat He loves to bleed
[2:40:38] <Tgsnum5> His whole kit is based around constantly being at like no health
[2:40:41] <mattskitchen67> people bleed sometimes
[2:40:42] <Smaenus> Hurt me more, dog
[2:40:44] <%Keyd00d> do you bleed?
[2:40:45] <Tgsnum5> He gets *buffed* at Death's Door
[2:40:49] <admiral_of_crunch> Bring band-aids Kappa
[2:40:50] <%simulationbard> He's in to it
[2:40:52] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> He whips himself into shape VoHiYo
[2:40:53] <%ThePuddingDead> he's like Dark Knight from XIV, more damage he gets the stronger his moves are @AngriestPat
[2:40:55] <pabloelenano2> @AngriestPat think about him as a emoplomancer
[2:40:56] <arcaderabbit48> I have never used a Flagellant and am very interested in where this goes
[2:40:57] <manoshake> bleeding is very nice actually
[2:40:58] <Finakala> Flagellants literally punish themselves, that's their whole deal
[2:41:00] <mr_slaide> Good choice.
[2:41:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BLOOD MAN
[2:41:07] <Zebroneath> Some of Flagellants locked skills has a health requirement.
[2:41:09] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat don't take flagellant, he doesn't have any good skills right now
[2:41:10] <luckysteak> barbaric YAWP is the best stun. I love it!
[2:41:14] <manoshake> grab an oven
[2:41:14] <mr_slaide> Pat... Healer.
[2:41:15] <admiral_of_crunch> Hellion is your Berserker
[2:41:16] <+Cavumentum> >No Healer
[2:41:18] <buffmurffy> HEALER
[2:41:19] <%simulationbard> Healer
[2:41:20] <CobaltLounge> stop kink shameing pat!
[2:41:21] <+TheWallOfMeat> Not bringing a healer I see
[2:41:23] <admiral_of_crunch> Healer
[2:41:24] <+TheWallOfMeat> Bold move
[2:41:25] <BaronVonProlix> You actually WANT the Flag at deaths door
[2:41:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[2:41:26] <manoshake> healer
[2:41:27] <%simulationbard> HEALER
[2:41:28] <%Zaramoth> apatHoldon
[2:41:32] <UnderpaidBob> there's a sick dragonslayer skin for Hellion
[2:41:33] <%klutch02> HEALER PLEZ
[2:41:33] <%ThePuddingDead> check musketeer, she have bandage?
[2:41:35] <arcaderabbit48> "Oh, she likes THAT position~~~"
[2:41:35] <SiegeJay> No healer. Nothing will go wrong Kappa
[2:41:36] <admiral_of_crunch> NotLikeThis
[2:41:36] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat You might want to buy different skills for Flagellent
[2:41:39] <manoshake> heal er
[2:41:41] <dekkitout> this is what, the second time the word 'yawp' has been on this stream, this year alone?
[2:41:42] <Smaenus> What a name
[2:41:44] <Smaenus> Wadard
[2:41:51] <%ThePuddingDead> he has 2 healers, what are u talking about
[2:41:55] <Endocrom> Can't Flagelent heal? maybe at higher levels
[2:42:01] <manoshake> relaeh
[2:42:02] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat No dedicated healer. What could possibly go wrong.
[2:42:05] <jimmychiken> !uptime
[2:42:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 42m.
[2:42:09] <+chrissycht> buy skills from guild u fuck
[2:42:09] <admiral_of_crunch> His build is questionable, maybe take these guys into the guild and swap around skills
[2:42:18] <+TheWallOfMeat> @Sitromxe Occultist is close enough
[2:42:19] <%trnzero> buy the skill then
[2:42:20] <admiral_of_crunch> GET NEW SKILLS
[2:42:23] <+NameInsertable> Time to start buying skills
[2:42:26] <TranquilTurnip> Occulist and Flagellant should be enough healing
[2:42:26] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you should take off flag
[2:42:46] <Bobbledygook> oh shit fuck yeah this is happening
[2:42:46] <admiral_of_crunch> EXSANGUINATE
[2:42:47] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatBig HEAL
[2:42:52] <%simulationbard> Flag can kinda heal but I find it's better not to use him as a primary healer
[2:42:52] <Tgsnum5> No Flag is great
[2:42:54] <TranquilTurnip> He should try to use the Flagellant tho
[2:42:56] <Tgsnum5> He just needs better skills
[2:42:59] <%simulationbard> Flag is flagellant
[2:42:59] <luckysteak> this is a good team comp
[2:43:00] <Kefkaisnotamused> Healing is for pansies! A real man runs head first into an army of evil undead with just a stick and sheer will!
[2:43:04] <%ThePuddingDead> thats a bug
[2:43:10] <admiral_of_crunch> You want those big heals
[2:43:14] <TranquilTurnip> Flagellant has the only Heal over Time in the game
[2:43:14] <%Niney_Who> Exsanguinate
[2:43:20] <%Niney_Who> Is what it's called
[2:43:21] <+RawrzorsGrrr> Exsanguinate
[2:43:24] <luckysteak> take the 3rd one
[2:43:25] <admiral_of_crunch> Exsanguinate
[2:43:25] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat if you rock flag use redeem and ensaguinate
[2:43:30] <BaronVonProlix> The more hurt he is, the better he does
[2:43:32] <luckysteak> it is a big heal for flag
[2:43:33] <admiral_of_crunch> Nope
[2:43:36] <+TheWallOfMeat> Read Pat, Read.
[2:43:36] <manoshake> exsanguinate
[2:43:40] <%trnzero> He heals and does mucho damage
[2:43:41] <admiral_of_crunch> One is a big attack, the other is a big heal
[2:43:43] <%AirlineFood74> read
[2:43:43] <TranquilTurnip> Exanguinate and Redeem are really good
[2:43:44] <Sir__Nova> Exsanguinate is stupid powerful
[2:43:53] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat redeem gives you a big heal ensaguinate steals hp
[2:43:55] <%joylent_blue> Monstrous size alone has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue
[2:43:55] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat one's an attac the other is a heal
[2:43:59] <+Bouerd> Flagellant loves being at low HP and high stress
[2:43:59] <Sitromxe> @TheWallOfMeat Their healing skill is a bizzare coinflip of death. The Nun's healing skill is better, purely due to reliability.
[2:44:03] <Smaenus> Never seen flagellant before, I am interested
[2:44:10] <BaronVonProlix> His deal is he whips himself for buffs
[2:44:11] <luckysteak> that is what i'm talking about
[2:44:15] <%ThePuddingDead> looks good
[2:44:19] <+TheWallOfMeat> @Sitromxe Yes but we're here to watch Pat suffer, coinflips are optimal
[2:44:24] <TranquilTurnip> @Smaenus its so fun
[2:44:27] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat take off the last skill and get the heal
[2:44:30] <admiral_of_crunch> @AngriestPat Also you can swap skills mid-dungeon
[2:44:31] <+Cavumentum> Big bleed boys
[2:44:31] <luckysteak> awesome
[2:44:36] <%ThePuddingDead> he's extra easy since its radiant
[2:44:38] <Kefkaisnotamused> The flaggelant is fun.
[2:44:40] <%ThePuddingDead> no stress
[2:44:45] <+ateliermorgan> flaggelant is top tier
[2:44:48] <%Svanyr> apatWink
[2:44:49] <Tgsnum5> Yeah, dude is like immortal at higher levels. Flag is fun as fuck
[2:44:53] <Coystick> Flagellant is so good they won't let you stack him.
[2:44:59] <Smaenus> I love that his equipment is just his bare torso LUL
[2:45:00] <luckysteak> hands of the abyss sucks
[2:45:05] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat flag likes to be in front with 40% hp or less to use his powerfull moves
[2:45:06] <%Niney_Who> Remove hands from the abyss since he's in the way back
[2:45:09] <TranquilTurnip> Abyssal Artillary is good, Hand of the abyss isn't great
[2:45:11] <admiral_of_crunch> This is the fun DLC class that basically stole half a toolkit from the Martyr cladd mod
[2:45:23] <arcaderabbit48> @Smaenus And it gets upgraded but adding more scars to it
[2:45:24] <luckysteak> weakening curse is great for bosses
[2:45:28] <BaronVonProlix> AA is great for tickling backliners
[2:45:29] <%Niney_Who> Weakening Curse and Vulnerability Curse are great
[2:45:32] <+NameInsertable> @AngriestPat Occult debuffs are great for longer fights
[2:45:32] <@Pandora_Prime> Weakening curse wrecks bosses at higher levels
[2:45:35] <Smaenus> @arcaderabbit48 Oh fuck that's so cool
[2:45:35] <admiral_of_crunch> Weakening curse is great when shit gets dire later on
[2:45:45] <admiral_of_crunch> YEP
[2:45:48] <%Niney_Who> Remove Hands and Stab, get ARtyllers and Vulnerability Hex
[2:45:52] <%Niney_Who> *Artillery
[2:45:54] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat weakening curse is good for a party that has someone who does more damage in marked targets
[2:45:54] <Tgsnum5> Abyssal is good. The debuffs are great for bosses
[2:45:54] <%trnzero> musketeer benefits from marks
[2:45:57] <BaronVonProlix> YEAH get the curses! Vuln hex marks dudes for great damage
[2:45:59] <admiral_of_crunch> Yep, since you've got a musket
[2:46:05] <%skizzuto> you forgot the artillery skill
[2:46:08] <Finakala> You didn't take artillery did you?
[2:46:08] <luckysteak> get rid of hands of the abyss, pat!!!!!
[2:46:09] <%Niney_Who> You didn't remove Hands
[2:46:09] <admiral_of_crunch> Uhhhhhhhhhh
[2:46:13] <arcaderabbit48> @Smaenus The final upgrade has him scarring the reoccurring sigil of the Darkest Dungeon on his chest
[2:46:17] <admiral_of_crunch> YEP
[2:46:19] <@Pandora_Prime> IRON SWAN DESTROYS MOST BOSSES
[2:46:20] <+Haarute> Iron Swan is great.
[2:46:20] <SomeDwarf> Iron Swan is the shit
[2:46:23] <+Bouerd> Iron swan is great
[2:46:24] <leole11> Iron Swan = Fuck you, backliner
[2:46:25] <%Niney_Who> Yeah but she has to be in the very front
[2:46:25] <luckysteak> attaboy!
[2:46:25] <BaronVonProlix> IRON SWAN IS THE BEST
[2:46:29] <%QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[2:46:29] <@Pandora_Prime> Especially Necro
[2:46:30] <person181> iron swan is THE BEST
[2:46:33] <mr_slaide> Yop
[2:46:34] <%simulationbard> Iron Swan is a fantastic skill
[2:46:37] <Smaenus> @arcaderabbit48 I really need to get back into this game damn
[2:46:38] <%joylent_blue> occultist can synergize really well with bounty hunter and hound master
[2:46:38] <CrimsonFox777> YAWP!
[2:46:39] <%Niney_Who> YAWP
[2:46:41] <%ThePuddingDead> i hate her stun movement moves
[2:46:42] <luckysteak> yawp is amazing
[2:46:46] <admiral_of_crunch> Hellion is your Berserker. She's great
[2:46:47] <pigeontactician> to defeat...the huns
[2:46:47] <Kefkaisnotamused> Hex is amazing so you dont pull your hair out when the enemy dodges all the time. That frustrates me so much.
[2:46:53] <%ThePuddingDead> it DEBUFFS you, its garbo
[2:46:57] <person181> rush is super good to have
[2:46:58] <luckysteak> that is a good idea!
[2:47:00] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Iron SWAN
[2:47:01] <admiral_of_crunch> If it bleeds is good
[2:47:03] <BaronVonProlix> Hellion is awesome
[2:47:04] <%Niney_Who> Rush or If it Bleeds
[2:47:04] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat yeah, swap rush for adrenaline
[2:47:05] <admiral_of_crunch> Adrenaline rush is also good
[2:47:08] <luckysteak> two stuns are worth a little debuff
[2:47:11] <%FrostMass22> These are all temporary buffs, therefore worthless
[2:47:14] <%QueequegTheater> Bleed out
[2:47:18] <pectusumbra> My personal hellion set is is hack, swan, if it bleeds, then whatever
[2:47:21] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> If it BLEEDS is GREAT
[2:47:23] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat weakening curse is good for a party that has someone who does more damage in marked targets
[2:47:24] <SomeDwarf> Pat can I mention something because I played through the whole game straight up did not know about it @AngriestPat
[2:47:24] <mr_slaide> Yalp is a nasty debuff
[2:47:26] <person181> hellion i think i my fav class
[2:47:27] <%ThePuddingDead> the debuffs stack and last too long
[2:47:27] <+TheWallOfMeat> Literally all of her moves are good.
[2:47:30] <%QueequegTheater> It's a double stun
[2:47:31] <+Cavumentum> Everything's good if you don't suck
[2:47:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DEBUFF is NOT WORTH
[2:47:34] <%klutch02> Bleed is great on big mobs and bosses
[2:47:34] <%ThePuddingDead> she hits like a noodle when debuffed
[2:47:37] <%QueequegTheater> Literally her best skill
[2:47:39] <admiral_of_crunch> Whatever
[2:47:46] <%Niney_Who> It's really worth it tho
[2:47:49] <admiral_of_crunch> Debuffs go away at the end of the fight anyway so fuck it
[2:47:51] <luckysteak> stuns two guys
[2:47:54] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the stun is great, stuns the two in front
[2:47:54] <%QueequegTheater> It hits 1 and 2 at same time
[2:47:55] <@Mechz71> fuck the debuff the double stun is great
[2:47:57] <%simulationbard> Hits rank one and two
[2:48:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yawp hits first two
[2:48:02] <mr_slaide> It stuns the first two, but it debuffs. It can be useful.
[2:48:05] <%Kduff89> what mech said
[2:48:09] <BaronVonProlix> Stuns rank 1 and 2
[2:48:12] <%ThePuddingDead> other classes do better stuns
[2:48:14] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat adrenaline rush is great
[2:48:14] <luckysteak> that is because it IS good
[2:48:16] <%QueequegTheater> It IS
[2:48:16] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Adrenaline Rush is pretty fucking good.
[2:48:17] <+TheWallOfMeat> It is.
[2:48:18] <%simulationbard> It's pretty good
[2:48:20] <Kefkaisnotamused> It's definitely overpowered.
[2:48:22] <SomeDwarf> Anything that clears bleeds/blight on its own is good
[2:48:23] <strangelee> I thought you hated temp buffs?
[2:48:25] <%ThePuddingDead> adrenaline rush kicks ass
[2:48:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ADRENALINE is GOOD
[2:48:29] <Cormic> it's good
[2:48:30] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat weakening curse is good for a party that has someone who does more damage in marked targets
[2:48:30] <admiral_of_crunch> Go for it if you want
[2:48:33] <dekkitout> self peel is always good
[2:48:33] <admiral_of_crunch> It's all good
[2:48:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> HELLION is the apatBig STRONG
[2:48:35] <@Pandora_Prime> A good tactic for Necro is Iron swan to death
[2:48:37] <%ThePuddingDead> all the non debuff skills are great for her
[2:48:38] <BaronVonProlix> It has no downside
[2:48:39] <%Sephrim> It is good
[2:48:47] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat we can't see how much money you have, make sure you have enough to buy provisions for trips
[2:48:48] <%joylent_blue> apatFist adrenaline rush
[2:48:55] <BaronVonProlix> @pandora_prime same for Prophet
[2:48:57] <SomeDwarf> You can change skills on the fly during missions as long as you're not in combat @AngriestPat I played the WHOLE game not knowing that
[2:49:01] <captainthunderwolf> Chat, I just got back, does he understand the Flagellant yet?
[2:49:03] <Kefkaisnotamused> @BaronVonProlix It literally doesn't.
[2:49:04] <%QueequegTheater> ( Õ†¬∞ Õüüî¥ Õ°¬∞) OvErClOwNfIdEnCe Is A sLoW aNd HiLaRiOuS kIlLeR ( Õ†¬∞ Õüüî¥ Õ°¬∞)
[2:49:07] <admiral_of_crunch> Musketeer is the arbalest reskin
[2:49:14] <%ThePuddingDead> patch up is good
[2:49:16] <%QueequegTheater> Take that, Moobot you asshole
[2:49:17] <$thebonebard> @SomeDwarf fucking what
[2:49:18] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat mark someone with weaking curse and use the dmg in mark from musketeer
[2:49:22] <SomeDwarf> RIGHT? @thebonebard
[2:49:25] <@shinsaryn> SKEET SKEET SKEET
[2:49:26] <@Mechz71> skeet
[2:49:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> s k e e t
[2:49:27] <DrMoose7> ?
[2:49:27] <%trnzero> skeet
[2:49:33] <%ThePuddingDead> its aa big party cleanse move
[2:49:35] <luckysteak> skeet shot is almost essential for one boss
[2:49:36] <admiral_of_crunch> Take off the mark and swap it with anything else. You've already got a mark
[2:49:38] <+Cavumentum> Skeet is just pretty good
[2:49:39] <%Niney_Who> Yeah she looks good
[2:49:40] <BaronVonProlix> @kefkaisnotamused lol, literally ‚ÄúConsume power‚Äù
[2:49:43] <+Haarute> If your Occultist goes before your Musketeer you can do a sick mark combo in one turn.
[2:49:44] <%Niney_Who> Skeet is good for one specific boss
[2:49:46] <+Bouerd> Sidearm is good yeah
[2:49:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> she a cutie <3
[2:49:47] <+TheWallOfMeat> She's fine
[2:49:48] <junks2300> Any plans to play Jump Force, Pat?
[2:49:49] <socratetris> Well F me, I came to the channel to watch the stream and Twitch sent me to the video of the last stream. I have missed everything!
[2:49:49] <admiral_of_crunch> Smokescreen ain't bad
[2:49:49] <%QueequegTheater> Take off the mark, another character already has it
[2:49:53] <admiral_of_crunch> Sidearm ain't bad
[2:49:55] <Mnightshyamallama> hellion just overall is a really good unit imo
[2:49:56] <%ThePuddingDead> keep her in the back like a crossbow skelly
[2:49:58] <pectusumbra> yeah, it's one of the only ones to let you hit rank 1 with her
[2:50:04] <admiral_of_crunch> That's wrong, pat
[2:50:08] <%Sephrim> @AngriestPat Generally, unlocking all skills is good. You can change them up mid-dungeon
[2:50:09] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat take off the mark target, weaking curse does that
[2:50:10] <admiral_of_crunch> Yeah
[2:50:20] <admiral_of_crunch> Sidearm is for when she gets pulled out of position
[2:50:21] <luckysteak> looks good!

[2:56:02] <%MrBorisMakarov> Jebaited
[2:56:04] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat word of advice, if u have a dot move, and there's a monster about to attack after u, put it on them and they get damaged when they hit their turn
[2:56:13] <captainthunderwolf> @waltzqueen Both can spawn now - the game chooses to spawn an Arbalest in the Stagecoach and does a background dice roll to see if she gets reskinned as a Musketeer.
[2:56:34] <TranquilTurnip> Let the Flagellant heal himself

[2:59:59] <%simulationbard> Yeah but it's super strong
[3:00:00] <Tgsnum5> Yeah his whole gimmick is that you want him to be constantly on the verge of death

[3:01:03] <drizzt6996> @AngriestPat I have not played this game in over a year and it already appears to have more new content than Overwatch! :p
[3:01:06] <pabloelenano2> @Run44forrest you can get ride of rng
[3:01:19] <+Nanomachiner> OOF double stack
[3:01:20] <TranquilTurnip> That;s fine you want him hurt

[3:01:23] <luckysteak> it is good, now he can exsanguinate
[3:01:28] <buffmurffy> so flag's a kind of self healing tank then?
[3:01:28] <Run44forrest> hhmmmm might cop
[3:01:35] <%Mr_Strut> fug
[3:01:36] <captainthunderwolf> @buffmurffy Exactly.
[3:01:38] <TranquilTurnip> He can't use his big moves unless hes hurt
[3:01:40] <someweirdo227> When you get cut and then someone rubs plague in your cut
[3:01:41] <$thebonebard> @Run44forrest when i actually leanred what each of the stat anacronyms meant and could make proper comps i manage to murder these dungeons

[3:01:59] <captainthunderwolf> Flag is a weird hybrid of a tank and a berserker.
[3:02:00] <CurrySauseBandit> Eh he'll be fine
[3:02:02] <TranquilTurnip> Healing him before he can use his big moves at low health kinda negates his purpose @AngriestPat
[3:02:03] <Coystick> no biggy
[3:02:03] <%simulationbard> Darkest Dungeon is mostly knowing how to deal with what the game throws at you. Once you learn it gets much easier. The game is basically all about crisis magement, things will go wrong, it's all about how you deal with it

[3:04:53] <%AirlineFood74> HE LOVES IT
[3:04:54] <%joylent_blue> he actually loves it
[3:04:54] <%ThePuddingDead> yellow numbers
[3:04:54] <%LupaTheWolf> YOU DESERVE THIS
[3:04:54] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat it's good on flagellant
[3:04:54] <scrumbotime> he's blood horny
[3:04:54] <definitelynotyakra> On the minimap, when you scout, there is a little purple spiderweb that means there's a trap on that square
[3:04:55] <%Superstarsage> Afflictions suck, enjoy.
[3:04:55] <dekkitout> Flag: WlTNESS MEEEEE!
[3:04:55] <televisedrevolt> Look at the GODDAMN MINIMAP
[3:04:56] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> He's so stoked LUL
[3:04:57] <Kefkaisnotamused> Maybe turn up the lighting?
[3:04:57] <%QueequegTheater> Look at damage
[3:04:57] <leole11> IT MEANS GOOD
[3:04:58] <TranquilTurnip> Rapturous is almost a buff
[3:04:58] <Tgsnum5> You literally can see the traps on the map ffs lol
[3:04:59] <Coystick> HE LOVES IT
[3:05:00] <beigesamurai> FOR F'S SAKE PAT!
[3:05:01] <%AirlineFood74> IT'S GOOD
[3:05:02] <count_bob> YOU DESERVE IT.
[3:05:02] <+RawrzorsGrrr> He gets a damage buff
[3:05:03] <%trnzero> @AngriestPat unique to flagellant, big buffs
[3:05:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@strangelee) (warning)
[3:05:04] <BeeNoons> LOVES IT
[3:05:05] <xxgoth_holicxx> Rapturous is good
[3:05:05] <BaronVonProlix> ITS GOOD
[3:05:06] <%simulationbard> afflection uniqe to Flag
[3:05:06] <%joylent_blue> look above health bar @AngriestPat
[3:05:06] <Panquake25> HE DO IT
[3:05:06] <Coystick> it DOES love
[3:05:06] <admiral_of_crunch> @angriestpat Flagellant's freak out is like a 50/50 virtue/despair state. It's not as awful as you'd expect.
[3:05:11] <candidateplays> More damage, lowered dodge
[3:05:12] <Piratedude12> He's super hard
[3:05:14] <strangelee> Don't you warn me Moobot
[3:05:15] <%ThePuddingDead> yellow numbers, he got buffed slightly
[3:05:15] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Flagellant has the unique trait of getting a Speed and Damage buff when he's crazy, but he will no longer Dodge attacks.
[3:05:16] <+RawrzorsGrrr> and sometimes beats the crap out of your team
[3:05:19] <%Mr_Strut> It means he fucking loves it!
[3:05:22] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat More damage, less dodge
[3:05:22] <BaronVonProlix> HE HURT MORE
[3:05:22] <%simulationbard> He stress people out but gets a big buff
[3:05:30] <TranquilTurnip> Rapturous is more dangerous than not having it, but it kinda buffs you too
[3:05:32] <dekkitout> flag is ready to party
[3:05:36] <lizard0tm> !uptime
[3:05:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m.
[3:05:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> food?
[3:05:38] <Kefkaisnotamused> Hysterical blindness is a common streamer trait. Commenting and playing is hard.
[3:05:40] <Tgsnum5> He hits really hard now, but occasionally just punches teamates in the face
[3:05:44] <nobknee> I do not like those sounds. WutFace
[3:05:45] <+skylerpilot> I love the flagellant
[3:05:46] <Nighthawkmun> Traps on the map dude
[3:05:52] <Coystick> "Hurt me a lot, more snake hurt me more dawg!"
[3:05:53] <%ThePuddingDead> this increased speed is making me nervous
[3:05:57] <captainthunderwolf> The REAL problem is when a Rapturous Flagellant has the Crimson Curse. They start skipping turns CONSTANTLY.
[3:05:59] <Estuko> So is there a unanimous best girl decision here or..
[3:06:04] <%QueequegTheater> YE
[3:06:06] <%Sephrim> NOICE

[3:06:10] <captainthunderwolf> @Estuko Yeah, Shieldbreaker.
[3:06:11] <%trnzero> actually a great first turn
[3:06:15] <Piratedude12> @Estuko Grave robber
[3:06:18] <%Sephrim> double stun is the best
[3:06:23] <admiral_of_crunch> @estuko Mod classes

[3:06:29] <Estuko> LUL
[3:06:30] <+skylerpilot> @Estuko Hellion
[3:06:35] <%simulationbard> @Estuko no
[3:06:40] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dat stress
[3:06:42] <@Pandora_Prime> dont heal the Flagellant so much
[3:06:43] <%ThePuddingDead> hes done
[3:06:46] <Piratedude12> Pat let flag go sick mode
[3:06:50] <captainthunderwolf> Darkest Dungeon's dirty secret is that a lot of its characters are kind of hot.
[3:06:50] <CurrySauseBandit> These flag heals are slowly triggering me ;_;
[3:06:54] <BaronVonProlix> Hellion is best yell waifu
[3:07:01] <captainthunderwolf> It's one of those, "true but you shouldn't say it" things.
[3:07:07] <dekkitout> let flag off the chain, release those limiters
[3:07:10] <+DingusMcFadden> Hey chat, is it true Pat once beat of a blind guy for cutting in line at an arcade?
[3:07:15] <%joylent_blue> pat you're not letting Flag access half of his moveset when you heal him so much @AngriestPat
[3:07:16] <+neo_crimson> no
[3:07:17] <%QueequegTheater> You should not
[3:07:17] <Estuko> @captainthunderwolf Im into the plague doctor
[3:07:20] <count_bob> No
[3:07:22] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat don't heal flag too much, he likes to be at low hp
[3:07:22] <%skizzuto> his good skills can only be used at lowish hp
[3:07:23] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> You're taking away his pain, he likes pain though VoHiYo
[3:07:24] <%QueequegTheater> He's better at low HP
[3:07:27] <Piratedude12> You shouldn't
[3:07:28] <televisedrevolt> He loves it, so no.
[3:07:30] <Tgsnum5> No he needs to have low health for the good moves
[3:07:31] <+emperor_z> He can access some really good abilities when his health is low
[3:07:35] <%Niney_Who> Let him get his genkai boost
[3:07:35] <Coystick> Never heal Flaggy, he heal himself
[3:07:36] <%ThePuddingDead> when he gets certain threshold in health he gets more attack power
[3:07:39] <%trnzero> he can heal himself w/ big damage too, so you shouldn't need to heal him with others' skills
[3:07:42] <captainthunderwolf> @Estuko She's a ginger, fun fact. You can see her without her mask in her lore comic on the wiki.
[3:07:46] <%Sephrim> Flagellant has health % rubber band attacks. They're super powerful.
[3:07:46] <Kefkaisnotamused> The point is that he whips himself for pleasure, so...
[3:07:49] <Coystick> He's all about risk play
[3:07:52] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @DingusMcFadden You make it sound like he jacked off the blind guy with that wording.
[3:07:53] <BaronVonProlix> Remember how boss exanguinate was? He can only do it when hes hurt
[3:07:53] <Hawajiggaba> Well, he IS a guy that punishes himself for sins both imagined and real.
[3:07:57] <A_Zealous_Retort> does Pat know what his name means?
[3:07:59] <%Mr_Strut> No you didn't
[3:07:59] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat think of him like Grey Fox: "HURT ME MORE SNAKE!"
[3:08:00] <luckysteak> he loves it
[3:08:01] <dekkitout> Witness ME!
[3:08:01] <sosuke5> he LOVES IT
[3:08:02] <%joylent_blue> he loves it

[3:08:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who said that
[3:08:09] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat he has a massive damaging life steal attack at low HP
[3:08:10] <CrimsonFox777> They'll move on their own sometimes when they're afflicted.
[3:08:12] <%QueequegTheater> YAWP
[3:08:13] <mr_slaide> HE SCREMS
[3:08:13] <Piratedude12> hurt me more snake
[3:08:15] <captainthunderwolf> @Kefkaisnotamused Religious insanity, actually. The Flagellant is like a self-harming Jesus Christ who can absorb your sins.
[3:08:15] <Estuko> Why is his boner so huge for pain
[3:08:16] <%joylent_blue> WHO SAID THAT
[3:08:18] <%LogothX> MORE snake! Hurt me MORE dawg!
[3:08:20] <Coystick> He's a suicidal super priest
[3:08:21] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> He doesn't care, he does what he wants now, his crazy is coming out LUL
[3:08:23] <%QueequegTheater> Is Emlo a flagellant
[3:08:28] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat don't heal flag too much, he likes to be at low hp
[3:08:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's Yoshikage Kira AND EVERYTHING HAS HANDS

[3:09:31] <Smaenus> all horned up
[3:09:33] <captainthunderwolf> @Estuko He's based on real-life flagellants who tormented themselves with flails to escape the impurity of flesh. In DD though, Flagellants can psychically absorb your sins and madness, so he's like a walking purity generator.
[3:09:33] <Estuko> shiiiiiett I'll throw my body to heal her from that stress hit me with that rifle

[3:10:21] <%simulationbard> In DD magic is real and powered by faith and/or deals with dark gods
[3:10:22] <captainthunderwolf> @Estuko Yeah, it's implied that he's lost all individuality and exists as a walking archive of human sin. Very neat concept.

[3:10:58] <Run44forrest> Pat is 4 Elmos tall
[3:11:00] <Estuko> @captainthunderwolf I'm tickled by the idea that he writes down on a notebook the name of the sinner and their sins as he goes through his ... deal.
[3:11:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's dumping the bucket
[3:11:16] <captainthunderwolf> Anyway, the hottest DD character is the Vestal. She's canonically horny as shit and was exiled from her church for either jerking it or watching a priest fuck a broad.
[3:11:23] <scrumbotime> watching people play apex makes me want to play more apex
[3:11:25] <someweirdo227> Pat empties his colostomy bag

[3:12:32] <Piratedude12> friendship ended with church, now brothel is best friend
[3:12:41] <someweirdo227> Vestal was so horny she let the fire go out, which considering the whole point of vestals is that they're virgins that watch fire is a pretty big screw up.
[3:12:53] <Estuko> @captainthunderwolf beat me with the mace then heal me, I can pray to that.
