[0:21:57] <%Dakuu75> What compliance?
[0:21:58] <28moogles> They remade the entire game in a new engine and it didn't work well.

[0:24:38] <%coward_man> yo literally just watched the episode where Picard got taken by the borg
[0:24:39] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I dont like that
[0:24:43] <%X2Eliah> Star Trek Picard is a really good French take on a Star Wars TV show
[0:24:44] <%Ipsenscastle> Picard: bad to do
[0:24:44] <%tsuchi7> does ME1 Legendary Edition have controller support on PC? I believe the original one on steam need a fan patch to use a controller.
[0:24:50] <%SWFanatic> Do you have too much money? Try ABC All Access!
[0:25:02] <%X2Eliah> @tsuchi7 all goo
[0:25:05] <%X2Eliah> good*
[0:25:08] <%KoiRedd> @tsuchi7 Yep
[0:25:10] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @tsuchi7 Ye
[0:25:21] <Profmcstevie> worst of both worlds
[0:25:24] <%stantheman_97> i know jack shit about star trek but aren't the borg supposed to be equals? why would they need a queen?
[0:25:28] <@Spydurman> they're a "peace keeping" org Kappa
[0:25:30] <dekkitout> Sure, gib lore
[0:25:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> Star Fleet is a paramilitary organization, not an ACTUAL military
[0:25:42] <%Treasure_Vault> I just got here, is Pat talking bout Enterprise?
[0:25:47] <@commanderclaw> UN peacekeepers are fucking evil assholes though
[0:26:02] <%SpcOpsBear> @commanderclaw yeah but star trek assumes they aren't
[0:26:05] <Blank9> ah yes, the post-scarcity federation
[0:26:09] <%logoth_> Plaigue
[0:26:09] <studleydoorite> @stantheman_97 I like the Queen as a character but yeah, they were always neater as a pure hivemind with no head
[0:26:13] <SaltyAzteca> PlaigeofGripes
[0:26:13] <%saiko2208> ah yes Plaige
[0:26:13] <%SinnerEbru> star trek lore is wack, i love it
[0:26:16] <Profmcstevie> Fuse them together
[0:26:17] <%coward_man> starfleet changes its politiics when the script calls for it
[0:26:19] <Profmcstevie> love them both
[0:26:20] <%WhereIsWill> plaige: the final fusion technice
[0:26:21] <dekkitout> Is Plaigue a potara fusion?
[0:26:22] <+FingaLights> Mash plague and paige together for BEST Waifu
[0:26:25] <metalsiren31> Starfleet isn't a military but you can get Court-Martialed
[0:26:28] <%stantheman_97> plague and paige are the same person
[0:26:30] <%ItsRatman> Las Plaigas
[0:26:32] <%Solid_Stro> Each and every episode is it’s own alternate universe Kappa
[0:26:52] <RadioFavicon> I love Next Gen and Voyager, but DS9 I just couldn't finish
[0:26:52] <James_Quivers> WE'VE ADVANCED BEYOND THE NEED FOR WAR THO, SAYS PICARD
[0:26:58] <%demiiluna> Section 31 feels like the biggest "fuck you" to anyone who tried to write Starfleet as a non-military organization
[0:26:59] <+SilverDevilfish> "We're in a war that we're losing. Let's mass produce the Defiant" "Naaah"
[0:27:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> And if they did have a proper military, they'd fucking obliterate the other side EVERY FUCKING TIME
[0:27:04] <metalsiren31> Starfleet lost its claim to not be military when they developed the Defiant
[0:27:05] <@Spydurman> what if Starfleet had like 20 Defiants?
[0:27:15] <%Scevda> Family family family
[0:27:15] <Blank9> and also their ships are still THE BEST forever
[0:27:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:27:20] <Jmann1892> Starfleet claims to be explorers until post Dominion where all they build are Warships that moonlight as Science/Exploration Ships
[0:27:27] <%your_big_dad> Kill a Cardi throw a Party
[0:27:28] <%Treasure_Vault> Post-scarcity, but the post-scarcity is expanding it's influence like treacle
[0:27:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Money can help who could have thought
[0:27:33] <Profmcstevie> everyone else LOVES money

[0:27:40] <%justcallmebobplease> Or goods and services
[0:27:40] <James_Quivers> Yeah that one episode where Picard says that is BIZARRE
[0:27:41] <%coward_man> yeah but 41st century is a utopia! theres no money or war and everyone gets whatever they want! liike picard's brother having people choosing to pick the vineyards for fun!
[0:27:42] <%justcallmebobplease> Those work too!
[0:27:42] <metalsiren31> Trade them Root Beer
[0:27:43] <+FingaLights> Cash or goods

[0:27:50] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Kill a Ferengi tonight
[0:27:50] <%Treasure_Vault> So why don't replicators fuck up all barter?
[0:27:51] <%jtdobyns> The Kardashians?
[0:27:56] <Blank9> money can be exchanged for goods and services
[0:27:59] <tanarath> Picard owns a fucking estate.
[0:28:05] <%jillyrancher> we got to have moneeeeey
[0:28:13] <+Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[0:28:13] <%Torus1025> They probably have a form of currency that's purely for trading with other factions
[0:28:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BASED WAR CRIMINAL SISKO
[0:28:18] <+TheBobulus> wasn't the Defiant a purely military ship?

[0:28:56] <%VictorVonLouche> oh right
[0:28:58] <triangularblasphemy> Tasha Yarr paints a HORRIBLE picture
[0:28:59] <%coward_man> picard is so romantic over earth being perfect it's sickening
[0:29:10] <%SWFanatic> poor tasha
[0:29:13] <triangularblasphemy> Picard is a fucking noble!
[0:29:14] <Sheenius> It's easy to be a saint in paradise -Sisko
[0:29:16] <%Garthunox> the voyager episode?
[0:29:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse I'd take the Star Trek fake military over the Star Gate real military. The SGC is comically incompetant
[0:29:21] <@Spydurman> everything Picard says applies to Earth
[0:29:21] <%Garthunox> the 37s?
[0:29:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BASED EARTH
[0:29:25] <%JoshManVGH> Oh god... it IS Bezos plan!
[0:29:29] <triangularblasphemy> He is the IDEAL british officer!
[0:29:30] <%Torus1025> LMAO
[0:29:33] <Blank9> does everyone on earth own a french vineyard
[0:29:36] <%SWFanatic> its almost like different people wrote every episode
[0:29:36] <%AmericanSkidd> utopia
[0:29:37] <Profmcstevie> WE DEFEATED RACISM
[0:29:40] <%afronooch> who took over the US?
[0:29:41] <%faldin> ehhh canada would do that first
[0:29:41] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Sounds like a rich college student whose daddy paid for their entry
[0:29:42] <%JoshManVGH> He wants to ship workers to space, they were right!
[0:29:43] <%VashyronM> @triangularblasphemy I mean, he's french and his brother runs a vineyard...so yeah
[0:29:45] <Blank9> because I'm sure not everyone on earth just owns a french vineyard
[0:29:45] <SaltyAzteca> We have evolved beyond it, we are the superior beings! Unstoppable forces of nature and blah blah blah
[0:29:46] <@SSaryn> Well the main thing is it applied to Earth cause he was talking to those frozen bois but very specifically business man
[0:29:47] <triangularblasphemy> Oh fuck, yeah this is what Bezows and Musk wants
[0:29:48] <%ahomeschooldropout> Didn't Sisko point out the hypocrisy when addressing the Maquis
[0:29:51] <marvel877> @triangularblasphemy and he's supposed to be french!
[0:30:00] <%spitelite> lol, yeah that will happen in the us
[0:30:01] <triangularblasphemy> @triangularblasphemy UGH
[0:30:02] <@Spydurman> an American WOULD do that LUL
[0:30:03] <%coward_man> it's more like if 1 city did that and saiid the whole planet is past it
[0:30:08] <%RrenKrieg> bruh, as a guy living in Pasay,Manila this is accurate
[0:30:09] <%cvp5127> just dont be poor 4Head
[0:30:10] <+TheBobulus> to be fair, anytime Starfleet gets too military, someone tries to coup a earth, so....
[0:30:12] <%VictorVonLouche> Discarded pc components FROM america most likely lol
[0:30:18] <Blank9> jeff bezos' son saying we are in a post-scarcity economy
[0:30:18] <bear_breaker20> never gonna go away either!
[0:30:18] <%justcallmebobplease> I LIKE that it's like that, and not as truly idyllic as espoused.

[0:31:00] <Dr_Mooose> he does it for the people
[0:31:01] <%ahomeschooldropout> like who's building the ships on mars
[0:31:01] <%TheHateFish> Why not?

[0:31:18] <+vaderxyz1970> But dont you love the earth Pat?
[0:31:21] <mattynezz> It's more like running a soup kitchen for rich people
[0:31:22] <+lemon_lore> keeping earth food alive?
[0:31:23] <RadioFavicon> Voyager all the way y'all. Trying to make their way home trapped on a ship made up of idealist explorers and terrorists having to get along
[0:31:26] <@TheYellowcouch> Spoil
[0:31:26] <@SSaryn> USE IT FOR CHOCOLATE THO
[0:31:31] <+SilverDevilfish> Spess crystals or some shit
[0:31:31] <%coward_man> oops replicators accidentally a form of currency!
[0:31:34] <@Spydurman> gotta invade Cardassia for SPACE OIL
[0:31:36] <%SinnerEbru> SPACE SOLAR
[0:31:36] <%RrenKrieg> @vaderxyz1970 fuck that mudball
[0:31:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> They really should
[0:31:39] <+Occisorz> disco season 3 does
[0:31:42] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse Imagine if they actually fucking aimed their guns. Also, a fucking M1 Abrams can fit through the Stargate, I'd love to see Jaffa infantry deal with that
[0:31:43] <%JoshManVGH> They also only produce moderately OK products
[0:31:44] <tanarath> THE DO
[0:31:45] <triangularblasphemy> Crush the weak for oil
[0:31:46] <dekkitout> Ditlithium is space oil right?
[0:31:46] <SaltyAzteca> BUT WHAT ABOUT SPACE COCAINE
[0:31:48] <%lumporr> it's called whale milk
[0:31:49] <triangularblasphemy> Like fucking olives
[0:31:50] <dekkitout> Okay
[0:31:50] <%Treasure_Vault> They did bring it up in Discovery, it sucked
[0:31:50] <%NateyBeak> THE BURN THO
[0:31:50] <%DrTomT18> it's like Stellaris. energy = money
[0:31:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Muh Dilithium crystals
[0:31:55] <%stantheman_97> that sounds like someone in a gated community saying poverty doesn't exist because their neighborhood isn't poor
[0:31:55] <%SWFanatic> we're whalers on the moon
[0:31:56] <%Garthunox> a big thing in voyager is they have replicator RATIONS!
[0:31:57] <SilverFaustX> that can be remade while in engine
[0:31:58] <tanarath> THEY LITERALLY DO
[0:32:00] <mattynezz> Got to mine that shit with SLAVES
[0:32:03] <%sonofthedeepsouth> But I want gold pressed latinum
[0:32:03] <%JoshManVGH> Spoil will save us all... wait
[0:32:04] <%TheHateFish> Don't they run out of that in that time travel thing of Voyager?
[0:32:07] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat dili
[0:32:10] <%peachy996> Die Lithium
[0:32:10] <metalsiren31> Nah but they fix it
[0:32:12] <@Spydurman> yo you see we're making sick progress on fusion reactors?
[0:32:12] <James_Quivers> DARK ENERGY ALL OVER AGAIN
[0:32:12] <SilverFaustX> they reconned that
[0:32:14] <cpt_langosta> it's like some sort of mass... effect...
[0:32:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck space
[0:32:17] <Dova573> lol
[0:32:17] <Profmcstevie> ...mass effect??
[0:32:18] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Wasnt there a Star Trek episode that tried to say warp travel was destroying the universe
[0:32:18] <+TheBobulus> I didn't watch Discover but I heard the plot was that delirium breaks and it fucks up everything
[0:32:19] <metalsiren31> It's just solved now
[0:32:20] <Jmann1892> Don't worry they fix that
[0:32:21] <Profmcstevie> so mass effect
[0:32:22] <%jillyrancher> oops
[0:32:24] <Eger007> who cares its just empty space
[0:32:24] <triangularblasphemy> I think we need about six billion more Datas
[0:32:24] <Dova573> Fuck space is huge
[0:32:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember the space Native Americans
[0:32:29] <mattynezz> Didn't it turn out that was bullshit?
[0:32:30] <Dova573> 'its
[0:32:32] <%DrTomT18> only if you warp really fast! and close to a planet!
[0:32:36] <%jillyrancher> and then they retcon it cause they realized how stupid it was
[0:32:38] <mattynezz> Romulan plot or some nonsense
[0:32:39] <dekkitout> Yeah, didn't original series accidentally invent timetravel from going super fast
[0:32:41] <Blank9> don't worry they'll just figure it out later :)
[0:32:45] <%SWFanatic> poor geordi
[0:32:47] <%X2Eliah> Silly travellers. Just use the Mushroom Network!
[0:32:48] <%anAngryHamster> Fuck them xenos - Michael Jordan
[0:32:50] <%vivaldiva> damn space-rednecks and their coal-warping
[0:32:51] <SilverFaustX> they fixed that
[0:32:57] <%TheHateFish> @Spydurman This the STEP reactor thing?
[0:32:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wasn't that explained as something different later?
[0:32:58] <Dova573> You think startrek could deal with reapers?
[0:32:58] <%stantheman_97> so original mass effect ending?
[0:33:05] <+FingaLights> Nothing!! clipyAYAYABASS
[0:33:06] <+dd44dostivei> geordi is otacon
[0:33:07] <triangularblasphemy> And then Geordi became a fucking anti-enviornmental truther @PatStaresAt
[0:33:08] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat dilithium plays a huge part in the third season of discovery
[0:33:08] <%lumporr> SPACE BOOMERS
[0:33:11] <%VictorVonLouche> So we move to tesla warp drives
[0:33:11] <%Ipsenscastle> just ignore it, it'll go away
[0:33:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> GET IT OIL
[0:33:14] <%DrTomT18> don't worry about it
[0:33:14] <+ItalianWaifu> isnt the response eh fuck it just dont go past warp 5
[0:33:14] <mikash91> Dark age of tech bay-bee
[0:33:16] <metalsiren31> You can't do SHIT about it. You think the Klingons are gonna stop warping?
[0:33:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> DID YOU GET IT
[0:33:21] <tanarath> I dunno, Mushroom-based ftl is pretty rad
[0:33:21] <James_Quivers> Now I'm picturing Sovreign but with a Geordie eyemask and a deep reverb Reading Rainbow theme
[0:33:23] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> But theres like a whole lot of space
[0:33:25] <%CatRidder> yes, star trek is like oil
[0:33:25] <%saiko2208> Star Trek is amazing and stupid at the same time.
[0:33:26] <%peachy996> But the Beat goes on Geordi
[0:33:26] <Jmann1892> That problem is literally fixed by the time Voyager rolls around?
[0:33:29] <@Spydurman> @Spydurman I think so, getting like 70% returns. Pretty nuts
[0:33:31] <dekkitout> Come to think of it again, how many times did the gang accidentally invent new forms of travel
[0:33:33] <%peachy996> So shut up and drive your spaceship
[0:33:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember how the Space Native Americans fucked off and the Cardassians immediately tried to kill them lmao
[0:33:37] <SilverFaustX> voyager was a electric car
[0:33:38] <dekkitout> *time travel
[0:33:39] <Blank9> just ask Q to fix it
[0:33:42] <%JoshManVGH> And the reaponse was like you can only travle at warp 5... Though THAT area
[0:33:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> sooooooo is the early seasons for Next Gen very rough?
[0:33:44] <%joebelieves> Pat-tron 3000 how is your day?
[0:33:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> I mean, yeah, symbolism vs lore reason. Fair enough.
[0:33:48] <James_Quivers> I wouldn't either tbh
[0:33:49] <ZComiX> What was the solution?
[0:33:50] <tanarath> They didn't
[0:33:51] <%Scevda> But enough about that. Lets talk about THE MASS EFFECT
[0:33:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Just ignore it
[0:33:56] <%SWFanatic> Voyager had writers?
[0:33:57] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Just forget about it
[0:33:58] <%Scevda> same shit
[0:33:58] <%Treasure_Vault> Maybe now they're running unleaded dilithium
[0:33:58] <%TheHateFish> @Spydurman Fuck yeah, one step closer to fixing the fossil fuel issue.
[0:33:59] <@SSaryn> Kurtzman with Picard also just didn't wanna think about anything Kappa
[0:34:01] <%jillyrancher> cause its stupid lol
[0:34:07] <mattynezz> Voyager doesn't count. That's how I keep Q as still being cool in my mind
[0:34:08] <%AmuserName> More like a PURPLE PRINT
[0:34:09] <%peachy996> Voyager's writers didn't want to do a lot of things
[0:34:11] <ZComiX> So what happened?
[0:34:14] <%Ipsenscastle> writers not wanting to deal with the ramifications of the problem doesn't mean the problem wasn't valid
[0:34:14] <%peachy996> Like write a consistent show
[0:34:15] <@Spydurman> Hi Paige!
[0:34:15] <cpt_langosta> wa
[0:34:17] <%Treasure_Vault> Picard and Discovery are thought-vacuums
[0:34:19] <Make_me_mad> @PocketBearIllustrator The first four episodes of Next Generation are so bad that it seems impossible they got another season.
[0:34:19] <knight_verse> @thomasoftroy or just send a nuke, which they try a few times and actually works... but blowing up a star is a lot cooler.
[0:34:20] <%Solid_Stro> Just ignore it and it’s fixed, writing strategy sabert14Box
[0:34:21] <@SSaryn> Rom
[0:34:21] <%your_big_dad> Quark
[0:34:22] <%SWFanatic> rom
[0:34:24] <metalsiren31> Rom
[0:34:25] <%chill_o_wisp> lmao
[0:34:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Rom
[0:34:26] <%lumporr> rom
[0:34:27] <%ItsRatman> Is Paige alright? She sounds like she's crawling on the ground
[0:34:27] <@Spydurman> Rom, he's more giving
[0:34:27] <%JumboCrunchies> w-what
[0:34:27] <%lumporr> he'd care
[0:34:27] <%Treasure_Vault> Rom
[0:34:28] <%demiiluna> Rom
[0:34:29] <SummonerMagno> rom cares
[0:34:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CAUSE HE CARES
[0:34:30] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PocketBearIllustrator Season 1 is straight trash, season 2 is like half good, half trash, season 3 onward is pretty good.
[0:34:30] <SilverFaustX> rom got a pornstar wife
[0:34:31] <%Dakuu75> Paige... turn your mic off again... (kidding)
[0:34:31] <+TheBobulus> not a selfish lover
[0:34:32] <%joebelieves> Paging Paige
[0:34:32] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> wah
[0:34:33] <%Treasure_Vault> Rom is a romantic
[0:34:33] <%xcompleasedad> He would want the chick to feel good
[0:34:34] <metalsiren31> Because he cares about the other person
[0:34:34] <cpt_langosta> the vacuous spider?
[0:34:34] <mattynezz> Rom, he cares
[0:34:35] <%saiko2208> Rom
[0:34:35] <jorniev> quark has the teert
[0:34:36] <%CatRidder> rom
[0:34:36] <%JoshManVGH> Roms tooth would get in the way, but he would at least try
[0:34:36] <Maids4lyfe> because he cares
[0:34:37] <%SWFanatic> hes more compassionate
[0:34:38] <%peachy996> Garrus
[0:34:40] <@SSaryn> An evil space fucker who fucks money
[0:34:40] <%cvp5127> rom cruched it twice
[0:34:40] <James_Quivers> Love wife, KILL WIFE
[0:34:40] <%Scevda> Rom
[0:34:41] <Blank9> quark is too conservative
[0:34:42] <+deadredeyez> psaJpeg psaJpeg_TK
[0:34:43] <%Treasure_Vault> Quark could be paid for a hell of a kiss
[0:34:46] <ohno778> ASKING THE REAL QUESTIONS
[0:34:46] <%your_big_dad> Rom has to care, Quark has quality
[0:34:47] <%joebelieves> Rom choice
[0:34:48] <%rDAKODAc> rDAKODAc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Where is the best place to watch Star Trek?
[0:34:52] <+JustToWatch> Think about Wife
[0:34:54] <%Cozy90> QUARK NEVER BEEN MARRIED
[0:34:58] <tanarath> Quark has a klingon wife, Pat!
[0:35:00] <mattynezz> Okay, what Quark had to kiss to keep his bar?
[0:35:01] <%Scevda> Qwark still has most of his teeth and they are sharp goblin ones
[0:35:08] <%your_big_dad> LITA IS NOT HOTTER THAN THE KLINGON WIFE
[0:35:10] <metalsiren31> I mean... Quark was married
[0:35:12] <%coward_man> boo voyager, yay tng and ds9
[0:35:17] <Blank9> quark's gonna kiss odo very hard
[0:35:17] <%Daxalog> On Plague's stream
[0:35:17] <%demiiluna> Quark did have a klingon wife
[0:35:20] <+TheBobulus> quark is married to odo
[0:35:21] <%jtdobyns> Sadly Paramount + is best way to watch it all
[0:35:25] <cpt_langosta> talk with gun
[0:35:25] <%anAngryHamster> TNG and DS9 are staying for now
[0:35:28] <SaltyAzteca> What about Batarians
[0:35:30] <jorniev> KILL THOSE BAD ALIENS
[0:35:30] <%ahomeschooldropout> tbh voyager leaving is not really a bad thing
[0:35:31] <%stantheman_97> you talk THEN shoot
[0:35:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah shoot em
[0:35:36] <%Solid_Stro> Ride wife
[0:35:39] <James_Quivers> It's fine since you mostly shoot Cerberus in 3
[0:35:39] <Maids4lyfe> Quark wouldn't get married because of how much it costs, and then divorce costs money too, and assassins are also expensive, so single and never going to mingle
[0:35:40] <%DrTomT18> if we are doing Omega then we are shooting humans
[0:35:41] <%RrenKrieg> Vega is great though
[0:35:43] <jorniev> IT ACTUALLY GOT OK WITH VEGA
[0:35:44] <+vaderxyz1970> Picario with Plauge
[0:35:45] <%stoatacious> I wanna suck the klingon head ridges
[0:35:48] <+MoroseLoki> What there's Humans in this game?
[0:35:49] <dekkitout> Jimmy is alright
[0:35:49] <%Cozy90> oh yeah iforgot about quark klingon wife
[0:35:51] <%Scevda> The shooting is pretty good tho.
[0:35:52] <%X2Eliah> Kaidan is good
[0:35:53] <James_Quivers> It took them 3 games to a make a good human team mate lol
[0:35:54] <+TristonObv> yeah, 3 has the best ones
[0:35:54] <%RrenKrieg> Joker is cool
[0:35:59] <+SilverDevilfish> Kaiden dances like an idiot
[0:36:00] <+kewlmyc> Jack is alright as well
[0:36:04] <mattynezz> Kaiden is fun now, because he's SO pathetic
[0:36:08] <%peachy996> In Andromeda, Cora is alright Liam IS GARBAGE
[0:36:08] <%CatRidder> carthhhh
[0:36:08] <+miguelrod777> you mean third time around?
[0:36:09] <%AkronymCLT> AkronymCLT subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey Pat! Bought and finished trilogy because of your streams and the discord, and even despite the ending shenanigans I loved it! There any other series you'd recommend to scratch the Mass Effect itch?
[0:36:10] <%RrenKrieg> the only bad-wrongs is ashley
[0:36:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> Ashley is what it looks like from other peoples point of view if you're playing as Renegade Shepard
[0:36:11] <Latija> are you gonna lick kaiden's pepperonis?
[0:36:12] <Blank9> kaidan's better later when he's not a party member
[0:36:14] <%stantheman_97> and jacob
[0:36:17] <PaperyHornet1013> ASH was 100% right
[0:36:18] <%JumboCrunchies> Jack is dope, but he's not really a companion
[0:36:18] <+TheAux> kiss kaiden krew
[0:36:19] <metalsiren31> Kaiden tried to come onto me and Liara was like 30 feet away. KAIDEN YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, YOU WERE THERE
[0:36:21] <@SSaryn> To be fair, it's like.. Pre-alpha.
[0:36:24] <@SSaryn> MAYBE.
[0:36:25] <bear_breaker20> vega is such a background piece tho
[0:36:32] <+MoroseLoki> I all I think about is that Rooster Teeth nonsense...
[0:36:33] <jorniev> I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE AUDIO OF DEAD SPACE
[0:36:37] <%Scevda> James is alright hes just a artifact of his time - early 2010’s buff soldier
[0:36:37] <%RrenKrieg> @PaperyHornet1013 being right doesn't mean correct
[0:36:41] <mattynezz> I don't like all the fart gas in the DS remake, but it's fine otherwise
[0:36:42] <%lumporr> @TheAux bad acronym there bud
[0:36:43] <%joebelieves> Any opinions on The Picard series?
[0:36:52] <%ItsRatman> Its like 3 years old but still relevant
[0:36:55] <mattynezz> Old
[0:36:59] <dekkitout> @Scevda Yeah, but nowadays he's a perfect himbo specimen
[0:36:59] <%Treasure_Vault> I wish LoL lore wasn't just getting balls dragged across your face
[0:37:02] <%coward_man> picard bad
[0:37:04] <%Scevda> Oooold
[0:37:04] <%AkronymCLT> James feels like a guy who was too sensitive to make the cut for Gears of War
[0:37:04] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Zeitgeist of League Players?
[0:37:07] <%thedankestmeeme> old video its a classic tho
[0:37:10] <%Daxalog> If people are ever talking about Malphite then its old
[0:37:13] <%Scevda> @dekkitout tru
[0:37:27] <cpt_langosta> gief really is the poochie of the patstaresat brand
[0:37:44] <%X2Eliah> Not really
[0:37:46] <%JumboCrunchies> One day he will return to his planet
[0:37:50] <+FingaLights> how does one pee with no balls to have it stored in?
[0:37:52] <%X2Eliah> Gief stayed for more than a season
[0:37:55] <%Scevda> @treasure_vault there was once an effort to have a lol lore but they sunsetted it.
[0:38:04] <%Scevda> Yes
[0:38:05] <@SSaryn> Is bad. Straight up bad.
[0:38:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Bork
[0:38:09] <%X2Eliah> REMAKES WOO
[0:38:14] <knight_verse> Gieg just wants his balls back.
[0:38:15] <jorniev> THERE WAS THOUGH
[0:38:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse They use nukes for specific things. I'm saying that for literally every *conventional* engagement, the SGC refuses to use vehicles and tactics that would tear through the Jaffa and Ori soldiers. They coulda steamrolled both if they wanted
[0:38:21] <SaltyAzteca> is there?
[0:38:23] <+MoroseLoki> Kidneys and balls are two different things? Bladder?
[0:38:24] <%JumboCrunchies> Has it been a full season since Gief was introduced? I have a hard time keeping track of all these characters.
[0:38:27] <%CatRidder> NO there isnt
[0:38:28] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Dead Space is dead
[0:38:29] <%chill_o_wisp> I miss shitstorm....
[0:38:33] <%joebelieves> Remakes = Retcons
[0:38:34] <SaltyAzteca> DS3 is a complete 180 in terms of everything.
[0:38:38] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt the best part was the Roomba
[0:38:40] <knight_verse> *Gief
[0:38:41] <+IShadowStrykerI> Shitstorm sadge
[0:38:42] <%peachy996> the only good thing about Dead Space 3 is how hilariously dark the series ends
[0:38:42] <@SSaryn> For 3 hours, it's nothing but Hollywood bullshit
[0:38:43] <SilverFaustX> have u seen the disaster called sonic colors on switch ?
[0:38:45] <%Treasure_Vault> LoL lore is a mountain of rewrites on top of pretty action figures
[0:38:45] <Maids4lyfe> I hated dead space 3 so much
[0:38:45] <%jillyrancher> It does yeah
[0:38:46] <jorniev> DEAD SPACE 2 DLC has an incredible story
[0:38:58] <SilverFaustX> its worse than balan
[0:38:59] <%X2Eliah> Also, forced coop is idiotic
[0:39:00] <%stoatacious> dead space 3 was so boring
[0:39:05] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I remember when co-op DS3 it became a running gag to make the most crazy bullshit guns ever
[0:39:06] <+D00msDayDan> nothing says dead space like fighting the living on earth
[0:39:09] <%RrenKrieg> just came back from malphite does nothing
[0:39:10] <%Tman451> AND Cover Shooting!
[0:39:11] <SaltyAzteca> CROUCH AND CHEST HIGH WALLS. IN DEAD SPACE> Ugh.
[0:39:11] <%peachy996> Like guess what the universe is fucked forever now.
[0:39:13] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> deadspace 3 was soo bad lol
[0:39:13] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Nope
[0:39:15] <%saiko2208> DS3 is really disappointing coming off of 2
[0:39:15] <%stoatacious> the shared ammo system was the worst thing in the game
[0:39:18] <%VictorVonLouche> The space grave yard is the only good part
[0:39:18] <Maids4lyfe> you don't
[0:39:18] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat The human enemies are barely in the game funny enough
[0:39:28] <%peachy996> More dying franchises should end on a low depressing note
[0:39:29] <Maids4lyfe> you keep fighting more humans with necromorphs
[0:39:30] <%jillyrancher> but yeah the intro is terrible
[0:39:37] <%RrenKrieg> and yes pat should watch "malphite does nothing" it is a perfect snapshot of League
[0:39:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YUP
[0:39:40] <%Solid_Stro> Isaac becomes cover shooter man, like all the rest
[0:39:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> KOREAN

[0:40:01] <%X2Eliah> Its a good show
[0:40:02] <dekkitout> Imma pronounce that Jose like the name SeriousSloth
[0:40:05] <knight_verse> @thomasoftroy They already have Human/Alien hybrid ships and battle cruisers, also remember that they are mainly composed by the Air Force
[0:40:14] <%Shubreaker> Joe say on
[0:40:14] <TheAntiNihilist> Yeah Kingdom manga/anime is REALLY GREAT

[0:41:43] <%Garthunox> did you watch that 7 hour RE video btw pat?
[0:41:51] <%Treasure_Vault> Did you watch the RE deep dive by Noah Gervais?
[0:41:51] <Necnill> Best nap ever
[0:41:52] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Dabbin on the side effects
[0:41:52] <%dooscent> tim sent out a patreon thing a while ago, saying that he's working fewer hours, for fear of destroying himself
[0:41:53] <Blank9> oh my god that malphite doesn't do anything video
[0:41:55] <Blank9> I hate it
[0:41:59] <%Shubreaker> beginning with a review of the tabletop
[0:41:59] <%RealThiele> 10g crew
[0:42:00] <Eger007> still waiting on that joseph anderson witcher 3 review...
[0:42:00] <28moogles> Two days ago he literally said on twitter that it ISN'T a joke about the game, he's just making a bunch of videos at once.
[0:42:00] <+dd44dostivei> @sonofthedeepsouth god yes
[0:42:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> You guys got weak immune systems
[0:42:08] <%lumporr> i hope tim rogers is ok
[0:42:18] <%jillyrancher> remember how Pat on a podcast totally called it on how Cyberpunk woildnt be even close to ready
[0:42:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse By the series's end sure, but early on they still could have wrecked everyone. Fair enough though, I shouldn't expect as much from the Air Force LUL
[0:42:32] <%Kiso52> Kiso52 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[0:42:34] <ZComiX> Makphite doesn’t do anything is the total package of reality rejection
[0:42:34] <%lumporr> yeah more tim rogers is good
[0:42:38] <%RealThiele> Sunk orb fallacy
[0:42:39] <%RrenKrieg> @jillyrancher i member
[0:42:44] <%X2Eliah> LUL cyberpunk
[0:42:47] <Profmcstevie> Not much of a callout
[0:42:50] <mattynezz> I don't like him, but him not dying is cool
[0:42:57] <dekkitout> Not a hard call to make.
[0:42:59] <%stoatacious> when is the patstares at vtuber debut?
[0:43:01] <Dova573> that vide in subreddit was great
[0:43:01] <%joebelieves> psaDown
[0:43:03] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Just watched malphite does nothing. Boy is that enraging
[0:43:06] <OldManDeckardCain> cyberpunk being a mess was obvious years before it released tho LUL
[0:43:12] <Dova573> I really like the origin of Steve Bulschemo
[0:43:13] <bear_breaker20> thanks not-so-crazy talk
[0:43:16] <%CatRidder> put shootgun take is right again
[0:43:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> "Excuse me! Why are you shitting on my plate?"
[0:43:19] <jorniev> 2 months before release i was like oh no this might be bad.... and OOOH BOY
[0:43:19] <dekkitout> "People like to make mistakes"
[0:43:20] <%X2Eliah> It's kinda odd how Cyberpunk has become a "nobody cares anymore" game
[0:43:20] <+Semiconductive> businesses are just people and people suck
[0:43:21] <%jillyrancher> Ginger man read his crystal ball
[0:43:25] <plainsongz> RIP cyberpunk
[0:43:26] <Profmcstevie> It's more understanding that everything that studio puts out is bumpy SOMEHOW
[0:43:29] <%jillyrancher> with goblin magic
[0:43:30] <%lumporr> games are 50/50: they're either good or bad
[0:43:31] <jorniev> i really fel bad about those poor devs
[0:43:32] <$Jetfandam> Expect the worst
[0:43:34] <+superchronicc> the nature of big business is too predictable for cynical pat
[0:43:35] <%Solid_Stro> Cursed with knowledge you are
[0:43:36] <AthenaAegis> Anyone that one with eyes could've seen CP2077 had MAJOR red flags.
[0:43:40] <knight_verse> @thomasoftroy Don't you mean the ChAir Force? Kappa
[0:43:42] <%stantheman_97> the more money a business gets the lower the iq of the executives becomes
[0:43:47] <Latija> people forget the witcher 3 launch
[0:43:48] <mattynezz> Cyberpunk cut like 80% of RPG elements, and they announced that, so it wasn't too hard to tell something was fucked
[0:43:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is there ever a timeline where you'd stream it again
[0:43:55] <@Spydurman> Fallout 76 has stayed in folks minds longer than Cyberpunk albeit not for good reasons LUL
[0:43:56] <Profmcstevie> The trailers took a WHILE to show new footage
[0:43:58] <%JoshManVGH> Trailer or conversational details?
[0:43:59] <%warpath1911> warpath1911 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:44:02] <%Tman451> once they announced they were cutting tons of shit from the game I knew
[0:44:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> @knight_verse lmao
[0:44:05] <%TheHateFish> Cheer500 Pat's bullshit has now passed the cinema test for this stream alone. Also I got a bonus this month, so it's time to support my favourite ginger goblin orb.
[0:44:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> The moment they announced the first delay, you called it on the podcast that it was gonna be a shitshow lol
[0:44:15] <%X2Eliah> well get them to the fucking hospital

[0:44:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT IS GONNA SAY KILL HIM
[0:44:37] <triangularblasphemy> Rogan is killing people with misinformation
[0:44:38] <Latija> hiding covid should be a crime
[0:44:38] <mattynezz> Tell him his liver is fucked and he should go the hospital
[0:44:39] <triangularblasphemy> He can go fuck himself
[0:44:41] <%RealThiele> this is how zombie movies start
[0:44:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Snitch

[0:44:46] <%jillyrancher> Tell thier work dude
[0:44:46] <%Shubreaker> yeah, fuck that guy
[0:44:47] <%MidnightBurst12> that's the hiding the zombie bite mentality
[0:44:47] <%Ipsenscastle> anyone taking the horse paste should go to the back of the hospital queue
[0:44:48] <%watts121> They are the people in Zombie movies who hide their bite.
[0:44:48] <@Spydurman> snitch
[0:44:49] <%lumporr> hope it's a blank!
[0:44:50] <%peachy996> Horsey Paste and Aquarium Cleaner does not cure your illness.
[0:44:51] <Gorshum> They're the people that would hide their zombie bite.
[0:44:51] <%justcallmebobplease> You're a zombie bite hider - you should, therefore, cease to be.
[0:44:52] <Eger007> bio terrorists
[0:44:52] <TheAntiNihilist> not if you stay at home...
[0:44:54] <bear_breaker20> but thats hype
[0:44:55] <dekkitout> Ivermectin can damage your intestinal lining btw folks
[0:44:55] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> big agree
[0:44:56] <%Deft_Thought> You're driving a car with no headlights on
[0:44:57] <%stantheman_97> hiding any illness is sociopathic shit
[0:44:58] <Dova573> Dont cry for the stupid, you will be weeping all day
[0:44:58] <Dr_Mooose> good stance
[0:44:59] <%VictorVonLouche> You just rolled a faulty grenade into a crowd

[0:45:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT WILL TACKLE YOU
[0:45:03] <%Solid_Stro> @spydurman Cyberpunk now just lives in obscurity and is only mention as a case study now
[0:45:03] <%stoatacious> this just in! Rogan is still a scumbag!
[0:45:04] <Zero_Jacks> Hiding a Zombie bite from the party kinda vibe
[0:45:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT WILL HUNT YOU
[0:45:10] <signofzeta> agreed
[0:45:11] <AthenaAegis> @Tman451 I knew when they kept showing the same footage and wouldn't allow any other to be shown
[0:45:15] <Deasmeister> Russian Roulette with other people
[0:45:18] <kikoeru_san> going out whiile sick literally equals being a mass murderer right now
[0:45:18] <triangularblasphemy> @watts121 Rogan is even worse. He is the guy who spreads misinformation about zombies and makes sure resources get fucked
[0:45:19] <+vaderxyz1970> This is how zombie outbreaks start
[0:45:24] <%X2Eliah> LUL yeah
[0:45:27] <%LordSDB> @Zero_Jacks I was thinking the same thing
[0:45:27] <%RrenKrieg> it wasn't though
[0:45:28] <%jillyrancher> was Rogan the guy who encouraged horse drugs
[0:45:29] <%Dakuu75> oof
[0:45:30] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Now look at us!
[0:45:30] <%moonmintparadise> i would snitch immediately

[0:45:33] <jorniev> I WOULD NOT HIDE IT
[0:45:36] <SaltyAzteca> Walking Dead BibleThump
[0:45:37] <SilverFaustX> that would totally happen
[0:45:38] <%Tman451> @AthenaAegis that too haha
[0:45:38] <%peachy996> Lol yeah Humans are dumb
[0:45:38] <+geekjacob> shit your right
[0:45:38] <OldManDeckardCain> tbf, people that tell others that vaccines prevent infecting others is also bad since that is BS
[0:45:39] <%lumporr> you're just walk around swinging a golf club in an arc
[0:45:39] <Dova573> ALL THES MOTHEREFERS WILL HIDE T
[0:45:40] <%jillyrancher> God
[0:45:41] <%RrenKrieg> i've always thought that people would always hide it
[0:45:42] <Dova573> IT
[0:45:42] <%Treasure_Vault> Just watched the malphite thing. Big hide the bite vibes.
[0:45:42] <%peachy996> We're terrible

[0:45:44] <jorniev> yes
[0:45:46] <%afronooch> one of many
[0:45:51] <jorniev> who are the others?
[0:45:57] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah no everyones stripping if they wanna get inside a safe house in a zombie outbreak now.
[0:45:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> I never saw people say it was unrealistic to hide a zombie bit, is that actually a thing?
[0:45:59] <%InternetShis> Man, what a call
[0:45:59] <%RealThiele> welp we had a good run, good luck zombies
[0:45:59] <kikoeru_san> Rogan is such an asshole
[0:46:00] <%moonmintparadise> Alex jones took that stuff on air
[0:46:01] <%demiiluna> We all thought "that's not how it would go down, we would all last WAY LONGER." We were wrong. In a zombie apocalypse we would crumble in a DAY.
[0:46:01] <triangularblasphemy> YEAH TAKE EM ALL FUCK IT
[0:46:02] <%JoshManVGH> It was a Child Psychologist in LA that started it
[0:46:03] <BigFingerRo> Now there's WHOLE fb grouos about taking horse medicine
[0:46:03] <%jillyrancher> fuck him lol
[0:46:04] <OldManDeckardCain> DO NOT LISTEN TO STONERS FOR MEDICAL ADVICE
[0:46:07] <%AmericanSkidd> he is impressionable
[0:46:13] <Zero_Jacks> @Zero_Jacks its not a bad thought to keep
[0:46:13] <%Deft_Thought> Like a real grade-A scumbag
[0:46:17] <%peachy996> He is an Animorph
[0:46:28] <%lumporr> oh is horsey paste not a joke
[0:46:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> @VictorVonLouche "We gotta inspect the taint too, just in case"
[0:46:28] <%Treasure_Vault> Horsey sauce
[0:46:31] <%RrenKrieg> ivermectin for humans and for horses are ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT
[0:46:33] <%X2Eliah> Also he got the antibody cocktail which is the one thing that actually works
[0:46:41] <%RealThiele> Joe rogan: Not even once
[0:46:42] <%X2Eliah> Man fuck alex jones
[0:46:42] <Blank9> I still don't get why people would be so terrified of the vaccine, but also still scared of covid enough to take other random things.
[0:46:42] <Profmcstevie> An idiot with a lawyer
[0:46:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> Alex Jones is a moron
[0:46:45] <%jillyrancher> Is it a horrible thing to say I hope the Covid does him in?
[0:46:45] <SilverFaustX> "gunshot victims cant get treated cause of horse paste idiots"
[0:46:46] <%stoatacious> man horse drugs are so good!
[0:46:46] <SeruraRenge> Horse semen is the answer to everything why else does everyone say it's such an amazing investment?
[0:46:46] <@Spydurman> I hate that all these rich people will face like no consequences for this shit
[0:46:47] <bear_breaker20> life is increasingly turning into a legal battle to not talk
[0:46:48] <%Solid_Stro> Joe Rogan is an Animorph?
[0:46:49] <%Deft_Thought> He was already vaccinated
[0:46:50] <@Spydurman> right?
[0:46:50] <kikoeru_san> Joe Rogan is literally one of the stupidest people on the planet, why would you listen to him
[0:46:50] <%X2Eliah> stupid ass gay frog fucker
[0:46:52] <+MoroseLoki> Joe Rogan and Elon Musk is all I think about these days

[0:46:56] <Dova573> That motherfucker dint take shit I bet
[0:46:56] <%Shubreaker> keep an eye out for family talking about "rope worms"
[0:46:58] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun2
[0:46:58] <%Deft_Thought> Him and Tucker Carlson both

[0:47:18] <%stoatacious> horse  drugs have given us horse paste and ketamine, horses are alright in my book
[0:47:18] <%Mattais88> He definatly got the vaccine already
[0:47:19] <%RealThiele> Compassion fatigue wins
[0:47:22] <OldManDeckardCain> alex jones is literally a comedy character not a person, only idiots would took professional advice from him
[0:47:28] <%peachy996> He's like Glenn Beck.
[0:47:31] <bear_breaker20> unironically a paid actor
[0:47:33] <%CatRidder> but the vaccin is making the frogs gay
[0:47:36] <%afronooch> Alex is a fantastic entertainer. its a fuckin shame hes a POS
[0:47:37] <+alwaysneedcaffiene> time for natural selection to do its job.

[0:56:00] <seniormeatbox> The best description of Joe is that he's a cave man asking a scientist to explain the sky to him, and him going "man with hat says that is untrue. Coincidence?
[0:56:00] <cpt_langosta> wait, what's up with chimps and rogan?
[0:56:01] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man! People in my region in the 1700s where so terrified of and didn't understand Tuberculosis, that they thought it was the result of vampires! So they dug people who died of TB up, and in some states, ate their hearts
[0:56:01] <%AmericanSkidd> ok but zombie chimps tho
[0:56:01] <+aBoner89> monke brain
[0:56:02] <SeruraRenge> wasn't that a movie
[0:56:02] <%justcallmebobplease> He would care so much
[0:56:03] <%greasypete00> zombie chimps would be the end of humanity
[0:56:03] <Dova573> if the zombies know MMA
[0:56:04] <%Dakuu75> that sounds like a good game-plot
[0:56:06] <Clowns> just popped in, are we talking about the horse paste
[0:56:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Zombie chimps would be terrifying

[0:56:14] <dekkitout> I mean.. if there were zombies, that would be a reasonable concern
[0:56:14] <notsoy> nah, some UFC old head getting zombiefied would be what makes him get serious

[0:56:51] <%stoatacious> zombies are punk ass bitches, I'm more scared of the guy in the alleyway next to my building, he likes to scream.
[0:56:52] <%Nekros4442> It's a solid recommend
[0:56:54] <mattynezz> Not too bad
[0:56:56] <%RealThiele> time to wait for the GOTY version
[0:57:01] <digaogrunge> Its those good bugs
[0:57:03] <+TheBigO75> @PatStaresAt I'm playing it right now and its REALLY good. Not too buggy.
[0:57:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt you can import custom potraits!
[0:57:03] <%Nekros4442> It's not as buggy as the the first Pathfinder
[0:57:04] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Chimps are already zombies man. They are attacking and killing Gorillas now
[0:57:05] <seniormeatbox> Peepat
[0:57:05] <%Meekest> Like a race horse

[0:57:58] <+MoroseLoki> Emus?
[0:58:02] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Zombies are just humans that cant use weapons and are stupid
[0:58:04] <cpt_langosta> emu war already happened in australia
[0:58:14] <knight_verse> Should have just shot yourself Pat, it's easier.
[0:58:30] <knight_verse> *shit... damn that sounds horrible.
[0:58:31] <%Dakuu75> I think almost ANY zombie-animal is horrifying. the thing that scared me the most in any RE was zombie dogs
[0:58:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Australians are already shooting poochies man they are desperate
[0:58:41] <dekkitout> Is no one concerned more about the literal dinosaurs that are cassowaries?
[0:58:52] <SeruraRenge> the reality is a zombie apocalypse would be way more survivable than people think, unless it's something like a rage virus where they get to be fast
[0:59:04] <%Solid_Stro> Gay frogs and government zombies, what’s this world coming to? doodStare
[0:59:08] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> ^
[0:59:10] <SeruraRenge> society would be able to contain it within a few days

[0:59:33] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Zombie cockroaches though
[0:59:40] <knight_verse> @perfectpepperplantpro And somehow they always win.

[1:00:01] <knight_verse> @cpt_langosta Australians neber had a chance.
[1:00:01] <%andrewofbob> @SeruraRenge Depends on how is spreads; Left 4 Dead's zombie virus was "green flu"

[1:02:18] <+aBoner89> did Shep have a bald spot the entire trilogy?
[1:02:35] <%Deft_Thought> @Fooguwu Caffeine can really mess with your circadian rhythm.

[1:18:18] <mattynezz> Unless they were a slave
[1:18:18] <bear_breaker20> did she preserve or just provide?
[1:18:21] <MaritimeSpanker> @DSD24 so I hear! When I pick up the Legendary edition during a sale, I look forward to going through it meself
[1:18:21] <%Dakuu75> this sounds like space Mafia
[1:18:23] <DSD24> Mercs that I killed
[1:18:25] <%peachy996> You got fornax?
[1:18:27] <mattynezz> The slaves were slightly less free on Omega
[1:18:28] <triangularblasphemy> WHATS THE AGE OF CONSENT IN OMEGA, HUH ARIA?!  MAYBE LOOK AT THAT A LIL
[1:18:28] <%stantheman_97> more space anarchism
[1:18:29] <Gruhunchously> Seriously?
[1:18:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I... don't think it's libertarianism she wants
[1:18:33] <%coward_man> "fuck off Aria"
[1:18:35] <%peachy996> Can I get a Turian copy of Fornax Aria?
[1:18:36] <@Spydurman> oh they fuckin
[1:18:37] <Latija> hot
[1:18:37] <%RrenKrieg> yes let's leave the best ship and crew
[1:18:38] <%Bailey__gaming> LEWD
[1:18:39] <DSD24> Aria's like "I can't pay your VAs"
[1:18:41] <%AncelDeLambert> what with her being the boss of organized crime
[1:18:41] <%RealThiele> booze woooo
[1:18:41] <MaritimeSpanker> As a Sentinel or Engineer tho
[1:18:43] <SaltyAzteca> Well dayum
[1:18:44] <%AllenDeadman> sure is
[1:18:47] <shallaska> Aria would boo at Gary Johnson for supporting driver's licences
[1:18:49] <%MidnightBurst12> hot
[1:18:49] <%xcompleasedad> Is she gonna betray you to get Omega back?
[1:18:52] <%X2Eliah> Actual reason is "we couldnt re-hire the voice actors for this"
[1:18:56] <Latija> is Aria a matriarch?
[1:18:56] <%Deft_Thought> "I may have been an authoritarian despot, but people were free, by the standards that I set!" - Aria, the fucking shitter
[1:18:57] <PaperyHornet1013> your friends with archangel
[1:18:57] <James_Quivers> She doesn't want the Shadow Broker seeing these secrets and whatnot
[1:18:59] <%Dakuu75> I thought she was gonna get racist but, she's jsut super thirsty for sheperd-brand "the juice"
[1:19:01] <%peachy996> Bray is cool
[1:19:04] <%RrenKrieg> @AncelDeLambert she killed and usurped the throne
[1:19:06] <%Scevda> Its worth it though
[1:19:10] <%LeiaSkynoober> Aria is super hot tho
[1:19:11] <triangularblasphemy> What
[1:19:12] <bear_breaker20> 1 good batarian
[1:19:12] <%AmericanSkidd> "as long as I can tell my buddy, Conrad"
[1:19:12] <@Spydurman> aria wants shepard goo
[1:19:14] <%AmuserName> "We don't have Tali-VA money, you crazy dude?!"
[1:19:15] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Jarring
[1:19:16] <%MelBrooksKA> "Let's just say I want an excuse to mix up the gameplay temporarily"
[1:19:17] <$hattrick61> Sucks that you can't bring Garrus and have Archangel's Refurn
[1:19:18] <%jillyrancher> I gotta be honest I really didnt like Omega
[1:19:19] <%peachy996> I think Bray is the one Batarian
[1:19:21] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:19:25] <%Treasure_Vault> Voice actors are expensive is the laziest answer, but it also seems right
[1:19:25] <%coward_man> "I want you to leave the Normandy" spawns on the normandy
[1:19:25] <%alphonseisbest> Aira is a landlord upset she lost her Slaves
[1:19:32] <cpt_langosta> those are a bunch of alliance and turian crafts
[1:19:34] <DSD24> Yes Pat

[1:19:37] <%RrenKrieg> for now
[1:19:38] <@Spydurman> "we're in a super secret hiding space behind the Citdel"

[1:19:57] <studleydoorite> I forget, do they explain the bipedal and similar body structures of the races in this game?
[1:19:58] <MidnightPacif1c> Charge is the only weapon
[1:19:58] <triangularblasphemy> Omega is a shithole, but it's a free shithole, but it's a shithole @PatStaresAt

[1:20:26] <%SWFanatic> hurricane smg
[1:20:27] <%watts121> Aria would totally use Bloodpack
[1:20:27] <cpt_langosta> why is there a "Q" on her upper back...?
[1:20:28] <%NateyBeak> smg go brrr there now you know
[1:20:30] <+TristonObv> Blood Pack Punisher is OP
[1:20:34] <DatAsuna> punisher suits her aesthetic

[1:21:03] <tanarath> Damave
[1:21:03] <digaogrunge> BUT YOUR EYES
[1:21:05] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Uh, damage probably.
[1:21:05] <DatAsuna> all in on damage

[1:21:23] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt it already has a huge explosion radius
[1:21:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> impact radius would be good
[1:21:24] <PaperyHornet1013> dmg
[1:21:27] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Lash is also one of the best moves in the game.
[1:21:27] <tanarath> damage
[1:21:28] <dekkitout> So is Aria a one off party member, or is she on the crew now?

[1:22:03] <MaritimeSpanker> Lash is super fun
[1:22:03] <DatAsuna> Lash was okay in the MP but it's less fun making AI use it
[1:22:06] <mattynezz> Lash is basically a better Pull
[1:22:06] <%Shubreaker> CARNAGE GOOD
[1:22:09] <DSD24> Carnage is good though

[1:26:16] <%DrTomT18> success as losing at every possible turn
[1:26:17] <triangularblasphemy> Oh. I guess that is a plan Aria
[1:26:18] <Necnill> god those eyes
[1:26:18] <AndyTrunks> Those are his special eyes
[1:26:19] <%coward_man> Oh no she's going Worf on us!
[1:26:20] <cpt_langosta> doesn't oleg know, i can see for MILES AND MILES
[1:26:21] <ThePrussianCyclops> you heard her
[1:26:22] <%sonofthedeepsouth> He is polite enough not to say it
[1:26:25] <bear_breaker20> aria penetrates
[1:26:25] <Dova573> RAMMING SPEED
[1:26:28] <%peachy996> Aria is very good at plans
[1:26:28] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> But the Raddest one
[1:26:29] <JetpackMcQuack> 👀 WHAT
[1:26:31] <@Spydurman> meh
[1:26:31] <SaltyAzteca> NAH MATE YOU CAN SEE IT COMING
[1:26:32] <%X2Eliah> eeeeh
[1:26:32] <triangularblasphemy> And the crew became fucking goo
[1:26:33] <James_Quivers> Deathwish Waifu
[1:26:33] <%sonofthedeepsouth> JUST KILL OURSELVES
[1:26:35] <+miguelrod777> that's not cool tho
[1:26:37] <+GuilKato> Pat what do your big eyes see about Omegas defence system
[1:26:37] <DSD24> Activate the Bass Cannons
[1:26:38] <%kyh9> BUT NAH
[1:26:38] <DatAsuna> belts are budget, pat
[1:26:39] <%AllenDeadman> it's fine
[1:26:39] <jorniev> I DONT SEE HOW THIS PLAN WOULD WORK
[1:26:40] <%X2Eliah> don't infringe on the freedoms
[1:26:40] <Profmcstevie> Biotic, easy shield
[1:26:41] <%andrewofbob> Normally you'd have unmanned remote ships for ramming?
[1:26:42] <%Piemono> Star Trek bracing here
[1:26:44] <%RrenKrieg> cover yourself with a biotic barrier or something
[1:26:46] <%moonmintparadise> no just hold the railings real tight
[1:26:46] <%peachy996> Aria is very Janeway at plans
[1:26:47] <%AmuserName> Project Lazarus Machine Broke, use the budget eyes.
[1:26:51] <%DrTomT18> seriously Cerburas rarely wins
[1:26:51] <ThePrussianCyclops> the chair would probably explode
[1:26:54] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:26:54] <cpt_langosta> what was your plan
[1:26:54] <DatAsuna> what nextm do ya wanna sleep under the covers? :P
[1:26:55] <+dd44dostivei> omega's ... not great
[1:26:55] <+holyxgrale> Shep put on a helmet you'll get something in your beautiful eyes
[1:26:56] <%X2Eliah> yup
[1:26:57] <Parapattern> Instantly failed
[1:26:57] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> gg
[1:26:59] <%moonmintparadise> OUH MY GOD I AM RIGHT ABOUT HOLDING ONTO STUFF
[1:26:59] <%RrenKrieg> this plan is dumb
[1:26:59] <MaritimeSpanker> that took no time at all to convince her otherwise
[1:27:00] <%AllenDeadman> sure did
[1:27:05] <+TheBobulus> star trek console death!!!!
[1:27:05] <%kyh9> Aria is the asari equivalent of Zaeed
[1:27:07] <%Solid_Stro> Ah yes, the Picard strategy, just ram them with the ship
[1:27:07] <%watts121> @peachy996 It's like if Janeway and Worf had a baby.
[1:27:08] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> No wonder you lost omega
[1:27:08] <%AkronymCLT> That plan lasted all of five seconds
[1:27:10] <James_Quivers> ME2 opening flashbacks
[1:27:12] <%andrewofbob> deja vu
[1:27:13] <MaritimeSpanker> WAS GETTING CAUGHT PART OF YOUR PLANT?
[1:27:15] <@Spydurman> "I know secrets of Omega no one else does" *rams station*
[1:27:15] <%unhuggable1> aria an idiot
[1:27:17] <%RrenKrieg> what a waste of a high-end cruiser
[1:27:17] <%coward_man> I think the plan started and ended at "fuck it"
[1:27:17] <%Meekest> Yeah Aria he said that
[1:27:17] <triangularblasphemy> YOU THOUGHT HE WAS BLUFFING?!
[1:27:17] <vicar_anat> mission *dust off hands* accomplished
[1:27:18] <%peachy996> LUL
[1:27:19] <mattynezz> Aria has plot armour and brain problems
[1:27:20] <triangularblasphemy> WHAT?!
[1:27:21] <%stantheman_97> aria is not a military leader
[1:27:21] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Kill your crew with stupid Plan
[1:27:23] <DSD24> At least Shepard made the escape pod this time
[1:27:24] <santafer> bunch of pirates, not military
[1:27:26] <Gruhunchously> This is the same cutscene from the beginning of ME2, the exact same
[1:27:28] <JetpackMcQuack> *has mental breakdown
[1:27:28] <+holyxgrale> Why would shep do this
[1:27:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Dammit Aria
[1:27:30] <zhenthrim213> WHY WOULD HE LIE
[1:27:30] <%faintsmile> there was no plan clearly
[1:27:33] <Maids4lyfe> it's fine think of all the dead Batarans @PatStaresAt
[1:27:33] <DatAsuna> LOADING
[1:27:33] <Dova573> Imagine the hope of the galaxy dying here lol
[1:27:34] <%unhuggable1> this shit pissed me off so bad
[1:27:34] <James_Quivers> "I thought he purposefully made them wrose, as a joke!"
[1:27:36] <%Deft_Thought> So the plan was to run a ship into the space base and hope you don't die
[1:27:36] <%Ipsenscastle> special eyyyes
[1:27:37] <%Meekest> Its fine
[1:27:38] <%jillyrancher> Aria isnt very good at her job honestly
[1:27:39] <%NateyBeak> get plo koon'd
[1:27:40] <+GuilKato> they really should have just taken one of shepards stealth shuttles
[1:27:41] <jorniev> WHY NOT PREP FOR THIS EXACT SCENARIO IF THIS WAS YOUR PLAN
[1:27:44] <$hattrick61> KNOCK KNOCK
[1:27:45] <bear_breaker20> somehow the pod can also handle ramming speed
[1:27:46] <MidnightPacif1c> well,
[1:27:47] <%SWFanatic> Plot Armor BItches!
[1:27:48] <%DianaTheAscian> damn it twitch
[1:27:50] <Profmcstevie> Aria you're a moron, and I'd know I'm Commander Shepard
[1:27:50] <DSD24> Action Man!
[1:27:50] <%Deft_Thought> YEAAAAAH
[1:27:51] <James_Quivers> SHEAPRD LEAP
[1:27:51] <dekkitout> 10/10 landing
[1:27:51] <Gruhunchously> Again, why does Cerberus have a fleet?
[1:27:52] <Ekaelis> Wait, how did the pod get in station if its barrier was meant to stop a cruiser?
[1:27:54] <+holyxgrale> 7 FOOT VERTICAL LEAP PogChamp
[1:27:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> What about the vaccum of space?
[1:27:57] <SaltyAzteca> His eyes are back to normal?
[1:28:04] <%jillyrancher> Aria T'Dumbshit
[1:28:05] <%Deft_Thought> Good thing you jump out and PUINCHED them instead of shooting
[1:28:05] <JetpackMcQuack> The plan is to get Shepard onto omega and wait
[1:28:06] <%watts121> It's never the wrong gun for me since I love the Lancer!
[1:28:07] <SaltyAzteca> Nope LUL
[1:28:08] <Gruhunchously> "Hopefully"
[1:28:13] <triangularblasphemy> I'm shocked that Aria isn't just leaping at the station in a spacesuit
[1:28:14] <triangularblasphemy> screaming
[1:28:17] <%RrenKrieg> it's the emergency cutscene gun that shepard always keeps in his ASS
[1:28:17] <DSD24> Yay the eyes are back
[1:28:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> Man that blue lady is a genuine moron, huh?
[1:28:20] <%DrTomT18> aria is not very bright
[1:28:22] <%Ipsenscastle> O_O
[1:28:23] <%coward_man> the game just putting the avenger on shepherd in cutscenes is the worst!
[1:28:30] <Gruhunchously> I will shoot the Cerberus with my Gun
[1:28:31] <%peachy996> RIP Vorcha
[1:28:33] <%Shubreaker> NO, VORCHA BRO

[1:29:08] <DatAsuna> yes
[1:29:12] <+OneGorillionDollars> KA-BOOM
[1:29:13] <%kyh9> Biotic rocket launcher
[1:29:15] <%watts121> yep cuz Flare is just a biotic explosion to the face
[1:29:16] <mattynezz> Yes
[1:29:20] <jorniev> DAMN
[1:29:21] <%Solid_Stro> @amanishouseofnonsense The Brand psaSmug
[1:29:22] <Dova573> Aria already touched that grunt
[1:29:27] <ARDM112> Flare is the strongest nuke-style ability in the game
[1:29:31] <jorniev> THATS A BEEG GUN
[1:29:32] <%RrenKrieg> why are the enemies so squishy?
[1:29:34] <DSD24> Powah Dunk!
[1:29:37] <%RrenKrieg> is this on easy?
[1:29:42] <SaltyAzteca> DELETE
[1:29:43] <Gruhunchously> This DLC was written by the same team that made Andromeda, incidentally
[1:29:47] <Profmcstevie> Hardcore
[1:29:48] <%coward_man> it's the "delete" button
[1:29:49] <tanarath> BIOTIC EXPLOSION
[1:29:50] <jorniev> THATS LIKE A SHOTGUN FOR SPACE HIPPOS
[1:29:50] <Latija> can you learn flare after this mission?
[1:29:50] <ThePrussianCyclops> GONE
[1:29:51] <DSD24> Shepard is super strong
[1:29:52] <%X2Eliah> normal, iirc
[1:29:55] <%Shubreaker> FORCE
[1:29:57] <%X2Eliah> maybe even hc
[1:29:58] <DatAsuna> @RrenKrieg normal, which may as well be easy
[1:29:59] <tanarath> DAMAGE
[1:30:00] <%xcompleasedad> Radius
[1:30:00] <triangularblasphemy> @Gruhunchously For real? That's really interesting
[1:30:01] <jorniev> dmange
[1:30:01] <Dova573> Aria sure is a Killer Queen heh heh
[1:30:01] <Parapattern> Maximum FORCE
[1:30:02] <PaperyHornet1013> dmg
[1:30:03] <DSD24> Damage
[1:30:03] <+GuilKato> radius so you hit more
[1:30:03] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> radius
[1:30:03] <%alphonseisbest> @Gruhunchously THAT EXPLAINS ALOT
[1:30:04] <%andrewofbob> Radius for shockwave is a good trade
[1:30:05] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @X2Eliah Nah, he went back to Hard Core
[1:30:06] <$KnightAsteran> @gruhunchously ah
[1:30:06] <+OneGorillionDollars> shockwave is for cc so radius
[1:30:07] <+TheBigO75> more green more mean
[1:30:07] <Maids4lyfe> FORCE AND DAMAGE
[1:30:09] <mr_saturday93> FORCE
[1:30:09] <cpt_langosta> big spider
[1:30:11] <%Meekest> Radius doesnt seem like its much bigger
[1:30:11] <%coward_man> damage go up
[1:30:14] <DatAsuna> force = physics ragdoll
[1:30:15] <mattynezz> Radius, you don't use Shockwave fore damage
[1:30:18] <%andrewofbob> Stuff likes to walk about
[1:30:18] <+GuilKato> Radius
[1:30:21] <%watts121> @Gruhunchously interesting that the guys who made the Worst DLC made the Worst Game too...their multiplayer was good tho.
[1:30:22] <%RrenKrieg> oh wait right he has max gear levels
[1:30:22] <tattleworm> you're up close anyway
[1:30:23] <jorniev> DMAGE GO UP THOUGH
[1:30:30] <SeruraRenge> radius so it doesn't miss
[1:30:32] <DatAsuna> Also yeah radius/range upgrades are always too small to be worth it
[1:30:46] <%bravebravesrobin> *** ***  Cheer500
[1:30:56] <SaltyAzteca> Hide the body
[1:30:56] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> he sleep
[1:30:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean it's six and half a dozen with how enemies just fucking melt anyway
[1:30:57] <cpt_langosta> you live in there now
[1:30:59] <AthenaAegis> LMAO
[1:30:59] <duskfeydruid> PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn
[1:31:01] <%SWFanatic> radius is only good for crowd control
[1:31:04] <%peachy996> almost like The mp guys should have just handled the MP and not be forced to make a new game  on Frostbite engine
[1:31:06] <%andrewofbob> You can use shockwave on a shielded dude; he just won't go flying
[1:31:09] <triangularblasphemy> "No Ma'm we're getting annihilated!"
[1:31:13] <%Treasure_Vault> So how about rollback on the dreamcast? Pretty wild.
[1:31:25] <%watts121> "YOUR JOB IS TO NOT DIE OR LOSE!"

[1:31:28] <James_Quivers> HULK HOGAN, WE COMIN FOR YOU
[1:31:30] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> She scks at commanding a army
[1:31:31] <%RrenKrieg> @peachy996 a few more DLC would have been nice
[1:31:32] <triangularblasphemy> "Your plan of 'shoot the enemy with a superior defensive position while outnumbered' is going really well!"
[1:31:34] <DSD24> How can they if you kill then Aria?
[1:31:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Lady you didnt had a plan your army is fucked
[1:31:42] <%RrenKrieg> maybe even a me3 multiplayer expansion
[1:31:45] <%Solid_Stro> @treasure_vault doodSurvive
[1:31:49] <%Scevda> Coming for ya brotherp
[1:31:50] <%RrenKrieg> but no... a new game is warranted
[1:31:50] <%AllenDeadman> well enough it seems
[1:31:56] <triangularblasphemy> I think the army was intended to be fucked, like fuck em
[1:31:59] <%faintsmile> realistically her army should be getting obliterated lol
[1:32:05] <triangularblasphemy> Aria is here to get her couch back
[1:32:10] <tattleworm> piranha is the disciple but bigger if you want an upgrade
[1:32:12] <%watts121> Reegar Carbine is only shotty worth using
[1:32:13] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt that shotgun is better against armor and barrier
[1:32:17] <%X2Eliah> It's a great shutgun, but its just a shotgun, not "special"
[1:32:18] <bear_breaker20> still fucking butthurt they didnt do anything for multiplayer.....
[1:32:19] <mattynezz> N7 Piranha is what you want
[1:32:23] <jorniev> WELL its space so they have plenty of room to run away
[1:32:32] <%peachy996> The comparison to beta Andromena in Unreal to Final Product in Frostbite is probably still out there
[1:32:33] <%Dakuu75> 6 OUT OF HOW MANY?
[1:32:35] <%watts121> oh wait I forgot about the Piranha
[1:32:39] <%Dakuu75> (sry, caps)
[1:32:41] <%watts121> that's the auto shotgun right?
[1:32:43] <ARDM112> The Ceberus shotgun pistol (Talon) is basically as strong as Disciple, Disciple is one of the weakest shotties
[1:32:44] <triangularblasphemy> "We've landed in completly random drop zones. Team 4 fell directly into a smelter"
[1:32:47] <%Shubreaker> Piranha is pretty good
[1:32:51] <triangularblasphemy> "They're dead, obviously"
[1:32:53] <%RrenKrieg> @bear_breaker20 the multiplayer team had so much time and effort that they made a whole nother game but not a single large-sized DLC for the mp
[1:32:56] <ThePrussianCyclops> suck to be them
[1:32:57] <SaltyAzteca> Stop all the downloadin
[1:33:00] <%peachy996> The Piranha is my fav shotgun
[1:33:00] <%bravebravesrobin> that's the link on IMDB for Kingdom Cheer500
[1:33:06] <jorniev> OOOH THIS PLACE
[1:33:13] <DatAsuna> they're downloading a car
[1:33:18] <SaltyAzteca> Ah fuck, I cant believe youve done this
[1:33:28] <SeruraRenge> I really hate those things
[1:33:30] <triangularblasphemy> This is prophetic
[1:33:31] <zhenthrim213> it our old friend turret
[1:33:33] <tattleworm> so this is flare's downside, utterly insane cooldown
[1:33:36] <triangularblasphemy> AGAIN
[1:33:36] <%peachy996> thanks Flare
[1:33:44] <%NateyBeak> i like how gently he put it down
[1:33:45] <%Meekest> He really tried to put down another in the same spot
[1:33:46] <SaltyAzteca> *casually puts down another one*
[1:33:48] <jorniev> LUL
[1:33:52] <DatAsuna> when you get flare as a bonus power, shields will stop existing
[1:34:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PatKillsEm
[1:34:03] <cpt_langosta> you misst a itum
[1:34:08] <+OneGorillionDollars> yeah but once you get flare for yourself you can make it like an 8 second cooldown
[1:34:10] <jorniev> DOES he still not have the 1 2 3?
[1:34:12] <triangularblasphemy> "God I love my job" - Cerberus Technician, avowed turret fucker
[1:34:13] <mattynezz> Only problem with Flare is it has a HUGE cooldown
[1:34:23] <%coward_man> why would anyone use windows on a space station inistead of TV's and cameras?
[1:34:39] <Gruhunchously> oh nooooo
[1:34:39] <%X2Eliah> how DID you know
[1:34:41] <%JamesCorck> Omega has some of the best locations in ME3.
[1:34:47] <%SpcOpsBear> GIVE US A LASH NEXT COOLDOWN
[1:34:49] <DSD24> I super hate Cerberus Turret guys
[1:34:51] <%JamesCorck> This DLC is a lot of fun <3
[1:34:57] <DSD24> They are brutal on Insanity
[1:34:59] <cpt_langosta> you WILL be sucked
[1:35:04] <%SWFanatic> surprised there haven't been many phantoms
[1:35:09] <%Daxalog> We can resuse this room TWICE.
[1:35:11] <%X2Eliah> blind
[1:35:13] <%peachy996> Cerberus Turrets or Phantoms are most annoying
[1:35:14] <%X2Eliah> psaBlind
[1:35:23] <%Treasure_Vault> @coward_man I'm the captain, I get a big intimidating window behind my desk.
[1:35:29] <ARDM112> The gameplay parts in this DLC are way better than Leviathan
[1:35:30] <%peachy996> At least for that Faction
[1:35:33] <%watts121> @coward_man cuz of BIG Transparent Aluminum business. They force it on every ship/station.
[1:35:56] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The anime eyes comes with a debuf
[1:35:57] <%peachy996> Leviathan setpieces and locatiions are cool tho
[1:35:58] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt It's not you, Pat. EA shooters are full of visual noise for some reason.
[1:36:21] <%RrenKrieg> it ain't
[1:36:25] <olm46> If you've got 2020 vision, you should have warned us about the virus.
[1:36:25] <cpt_langosta> ah yes, the george lucas school of shooter design
[1:36:29] <%RrenKrieg> it just looks cluttered as fuck
[1:36:33] <Profmcstevie> Cinema is also full of dramatic noise, so clearly they're aping the awful style
[1:36:33] <%peachy996> This is 2012 too
[1:36:36] <Gruhunchously> Not to mention the Bloody Screen
[1:36:36] <%Dakuu75> FFXIV goes a little overboard on particle effects. (imo)
[1:37:02] <%alphonseisbest> @Dakuu75 theres a setting for that
[1:37:04] <triangularblasphemy> Huh. Frag grenades work a lil different in the future
[1:37:23] <%RrenKrieg> @Dakuu75 i can give mmos a pass, mostly because they need to convey hard information
[1:37:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Maybe if they send more dudes it'll stop Shepherd this time.
[1:37:36] <DSD24> Pat is Hackerman
[1:37:38] <%jillyrancher> gotta be honest, this DLC is like 90% combat arenas lol
[1:37:43] <Dave_VD> What is that weapon pat is using?
[1:37:47] <jorniev> this plan is terrible
[1:37:49] <%jillyrancher> Big hack
[1:37:52] <Gruhunchously> When they don't have anything interesting to show you they just clutter up the screen with visual noise so you'll be too overstimulated to register what's happening
[1:37:53] <%SWFanatic> disciple
[1:37:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You would think it would need a password

[1:38:55] <RedPlasticCup> CHESS MAN
[1:38:55] <dekkitout> Oh fuck all the way off
[1:38:55] <Chester_goes_Berserk> this general is a dweeb
[1:38:56] <%peachy996> How would you know he's smart if he's not playing Chess Pat?
[1:38:56] <stormhawk9891> eeeyup, that's who you're dealing with
[1:38:56] <jorniev> HOLO CHESS PIECE FELL OVER WHAT!?
[1:38:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WHYYYY
[1:38:57] <triangularblasphemy> CHESS AND MODERN WARFARE ARE SORTA DIFFERENT
[1:38:57] <DSD24> He's a Anarchy Chess player
[1:38:57] <mattynezz> IT'S A GAME TO HIM
[1:38:58] <AngryAsian5> GET IT! HE'S SO SMART CAUSE CHESS
[1:38:58] <triangularblasphemy> BOOOOO
[1:38:59] <%JamesCorck> I am predicting Pat's going to shoot Oleg in the face.
[1:39:00] <%Deft_Thought> Quality writing
[1:39:01] <%Scevda> IT WAS REAL
[1:39:01] <+jojo_abob> thats how you know hes smart
[1:39:01] <mattynezz> GIT IT?
[1:39:01] <%Treasure_Vault> put a hotel on e5
[1:39:01] <James_Quivers> AND IT'S ONLY HALF VIRTUAL CHESS
[1:39:02] <%Mattais88> implies that you could have left it and fucked aria over, AS A PARAGON
[1:39:02] <%Solid_Stro> Of course he plays chess like a fuck
[1:39:05] <%NateyBeak> the chess board was the writers jerking off again
[1:39:06] <%DianaTheAscian> boooooooooooooo
[1:39:08] <%jillyrancher> Oleg isnt that bad.
[1:39:09] <+koalaf1ed> this chess game is a 1:1 match to my plan
[1:39:09] <mr_saturday93> He plays chess so you know he's SUPER SMART AND EVIL
[1:39:09] <RaidenRising> evil space chess
[1:39:12] <zanzibarian_hamster> THE PINNACLE OF VIDEO GAME WRITING
[1:39:12] <%JamesCorck> Honestly I wouldn't blame Pat if he shots Oleg in the face.
[1:39:12] <PaperyHornet1013> hopefully you die bray
[1:39:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> KING GAMBIT LELOUCH
[1:39:13] <goodcraz> how was that renegade
[1:39:14] <Gruhunchously> HE'S A STRATEGIST WHO PLAYS CHESS
[1:39:17] <%AmericanSkidd> at least he is a cartoonish stereotype
[1:39:18] <%RrenKrieg> i just remembered who oleg is goddamnit
[1:39:20] <Zombrocom> Ah this really was done by the andromeda team
[1:39:22] <%JohnAtDawn> Do they?
[1:39:23] <+GuilKato> how about you use the defense system to kill the cerberus ships?
[1:39:24] <%peachy996> I want to see that same scene but with Checkers
[1:39:25] <MaritimeSpanker> He play the chess because he oh so smert
[1:39:25] <%cvp5127> why is it half virtual?
[1:39:25] <BurdRightsActivist> CAME
[1:39:26] <%jillyrancher> Bray is cool.
[1:39:28] <%AllenDeadman> also he's a strategist
[1:39:29] <%JamesCorck> Oooooh fuck offff I didn't make the connection XD
[1:39:30] <%machshop> people play chess everywhere
[1:39:31] <$hattrick61> muh machinashuns
[1:39:31] <%JamesCorck> God I hate it!
[1:39:33] <Ekaelis> Aria and General are both pretty terrible in this
[1:39:35] <%JamesCorck> I hate it now, goddamnit XD
[1:39:36] <ARDM112> I'm pretty sure Traynor plays chess and she's not Russian
[1:39:38] <%Mattais88> Does anyone nowadays even know Gary KAsparov?
[1:39:38] <%peachy996> Or Connect Four
[1:39:42] <@Spydurman> as someone that loves chess I hate all media with chess except Queen's Gambit
[1:39:45] <%baka_sugoi> ded
[1:39:46] <jorniev> IF HE WERE SMART SHAY WOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW
[1:39:48] <%watts121> but she got more kills then you
[1:39:49] <BurdRightsActivist> ANATOLY space KARPOV
[1:39:49] <%Deft_Thought> Quite! Very Russian, bruv. Pip pip!
[1:39:51] <%xcompleasedad> But it's the BEST move
[1:39:52] <ARDM112> BTW Kai Leng is also part-Russian, apparently
[1:39:53] <%X2Eliah> it was a good move tho
[1:39:53] <%MidnightBurst12> it's a good move tho
[1:39:54] <%Sigma_190_Beta> But that one move is a good move though.
[1:39:54] <@Spydurman> and Code Geass gets a pass too
[1:39:59] <+GuilKato> is Aria set to agressive power use?
[1:40:00] <James_Quivers> I want the villain playing chess trope to actually have them playing Rumikub or Jenga for once, as a joke
[1:40:00] <%faintsmile> shepard may as well be doing this solo
[1:40:01] <%Solid_Stro> Only real strategists play chess during combat
[1:40:01] <Parapattern> He is smart strategy man at game that has no real world military application
[1:40:08] <%alphonseisbest> @JamesCorck how did u  miss that? its in every 80S movie LUL
[1:40:11] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan is way better than Omega
[1:40:15] <%crassletter> he's every evil strategist stereotype rolled into one
[1:40:24] <%jillyrancher> God Aria sounds so bored lol
[1:40:26] <%Treasure_Vault> The villain is playing Stratego, or Parcheesi
[1:40:27] <%alphonseisbest> @Spydurman fuck that ALL MECHA GETS A PASS
[1:40:29] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You're the style she is the flare
[1:40:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Omega dlc? more like OMEGALUL
[1:40:30] <Gruhunchously> It's just that writers always use chess as a shorthand for 'this person is smart'
[1:40:32] <DSD24> I'd be cool if the villains are playing Uno or something
[1:40:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> what's worse than cold war russian movie villains? SPACE cold war russian movie villains!
[1:40:37] <%alphonseisbest> looks like shit
[1:40:42] <James_Quivers> item to the right
[1:40:42] <%peachy996> yea
[1:40:42] <+kewlmyc> Is this DLC?
[1:40:45] <%jillyrancher> Oh hey cool enemy coming up
[1:40:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Real strategists play RTSes like command and conquer and Red Alert Kappa
[1:40:48] <%watts121> these remind me of the glyph doors in Blood Omen 2
[1:40:49] <+GuilKato> but you could just climb over because its short
[1:40:52] <%alphonseisbest> yes
[1:40:52] <%faintsmile> welp
[1:40:54] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AMAZING
[1:40:56] <%coward_man> only human allowed gun
[1:40:56] <%alphonseisbest> good job pat
[1:40:58] <zhenthrim213> oof
[1:41:01] <DSD24> Some of my men getting SHot
[1:41:01] <BurdRightsActivist> SPACISM YEYEYEYEE
[1:41:02] <%jillyrancher> feels good to be back.
[1:41:04] <mattynezz> I don't think you noticed Pat, but you're invincible during the Nova animation, and it's long enough to instantly cooldown your charge
[1:41:07] <$hattrick61> Imagine a villain playing one of those shitty 2000's tv boardgames like Elefun
[1:41:11] <DatAsuna> most of them will be batarians, so yes great
[1:41:13] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Levvi is God
[1:41:14] <James_Quivers> Because they're 90% Vorcha, that's why
[1:41:15] <%Solid_Stro> The villain strategists playing Fort Condor during an operation Kappa
[1:41:17] <%AllenDeadman> they are literally an army of goons
[1:41:17] <cpt_langosta> ignores shield...
[1:41:18] <%SWFanatic> psaBlind
[1:41:21] <%faintsmile> cerberus is racist!! get it guys??? do u get cerberis is evil and racist!???
[1:41:21] <%Mattais88> Because they weren't good enough for the actual army?
[1:41:29] <+Dakuu75> they probably eat too much space-mc'donalds and have stomach aches
[1:41:30] <triangularblasphemy> @PatStaresAt Because they are untrained gang members who joined for a shot at not being impoversihed and starving?
[1:41:41] <tanarath> Her people do What they need to.
[1:41:44] <%alphonseisbest> they are mostly Batarian LEAD so...
[1:41:57] <cpt_langosta> SPACE KANJI
[1:41:58] <%RrenKrieg> @PatStaresAt but that costs money
[1:41:58] <triangularblasphemy> ON THE LIBERTARIAN SHIP?
[1:42:00] <%coward_man> the training is "pull trigger, point toward enemy"
[1:42:01] <triangularblasphemy> EDUCATION?
[1:42:01] <Ekaelis> Telling someone how to shoot guns is nowhere near a military training
[1:42:03] <@commanderclaw> "Vocational Gangbanging Experience"
[1:42:05] <%faintsmile> who would teach that program pat
[1:42:06] <JetpackMcQuack> sounds expensive
[1:42:09] <BurdRightsActivist> SPACE KANJI
[1:42:10] <olaksi> gangster school
[1:42:11] <%baka_sugoi> GANG GANG
[1:42:14] <$hattrick61> Why dont the gangs Unionize?
[1:42:17] <%TheQuadrupleS> Vocational School for GangBangers LUL
[1:42:20] <%alphonseisbest> Gang Gang
[1:42:21] <mattynezz> This is Al Capone trying to fight the US military
[1:42:26] <Parapattern> Sounds like money better spent on Space Blow
[1:42:28] <jorniev> GANGS totally do boot camp, the FOR REAL ones
[1:42:30] <%Treasure_Vault> You walk into the villain's office and he's playing the full motion video X-files game
[1:42:31] <hassanico2> is Aria a girlboss gaslight gatekeep character
[1:42:31] <%Solid_Stro> Give them horse paste
[1:42:32] <%Scevda> Thats socialist Pat. Remember Pat this station is libetarian
[1:42:38] <tanarath> Why would she do that, that costs money. They need to teach themselves or otherwise the Great Chain will fail @patstaresat
[1:42:46] <SaltyAzteca> He doesnt have special eyes
[1:42:47] <$hattrick61> You think anyone in the Blood Pack has a space 401k
[1:42:49] <BurdRightsActivist> NOTHIN PERSONNEL
[1:42:52] <%peachy996> Oh no the mechs from 2 are back and evil
[1:42:53] <%greasypete00> LUL

[1:43:00] <hassanico2> ANGRY ROBOT
[1:43:01] <%faintsmile> is that a fucking super mech
[1:43:02] <+GuilKato> good forcefield design
[1:43:02] <%watts121> why are stealth mechs always cooler?
[1:43:02] <%Mattais88> @mattynezz More like Capone vs the Confederacy
[1:43:03] <zhenthrim213> that looked bad
[1:43:03] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Super battle driod!
[1:43:04] <%Deft_Thought> What a pointless cutscene
[1:43:06] <cpt_langosta> is that... a terminator? in mass effect?
[1:43:08] <hassanico2> >:( ROBOT
[1:43:08] <$hattrick61> And not terrible

[1:47:17] <DSD24> @HotSauceFiend Just the intro to the Omega DLC

[1:47:28] <%sporeian94> I always do omega before the citadel attack because it gives an excuse why things go to shit so fast and shepard doesn't know
[1:47:29] <cpt_langosta> i'm sorry, but i look at her and i can't help but see general grievous...

[1:48:17] <%andrewofbob> 2-sot burst
[1:48:18] <%andrewofbob> shot
[1:48:19] <%kyh9> I LOVE THE VALKYRIE
[1:48:19] <DSD24> @kekkerscrew About a hour and 48 minutes ago
[1:48:21] <PaperyHornet1013> good gun
[1:48:23] <%unhuggable1> never used it
[1:48:23] <%RrenKrieg> that gun is great
[1:48:24] <%SWFanatic> Harrier is best AR
[1:48:26] <%Solid_Stro> Invite yourself to her bird nest
[1:48:27] <Jmann1892> Its a 2 shot burst assault rifle
[1:48:28] <cpt_langosta> will she at least call shepard a SMELLY BOY?
[1:48:30] <%kyh9> Valkyrie is that good shit
[1:48:31] <%Tarage> Oh I woke up and it's Pat. Nice.
[1:48:31] <Jmann1892> I love it
[1:48:32] <Aiutare47> Two round burst
[1:48:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> GUN IS GOOD
[1:48:35] <%kekkerscrew> @DSD24 Thanks
[1:48:36] <mattynezz> g
[1:48:40] <%watts121> Harrier is the best AR by a mile.
[1:48:40] <DatAsuna> nah harrier is best
[1:48:43] <DatAsuna> but valkyrie is good
[1:48:45] <%peachy996> Oh yeah there's a weird gun later on in this DLC
[1:48:45] <%FunkyStreams> wheb you got a shield breaker plus armor piercing fire, thats what you use.
[1:48:51] <Aiutare47> It’s fine. Harrier is better
[1:48:53] <%RrenKrieg> SPOILBERS
[1:48:54] <KeystoneA2> Valkyrie, Falcon, and Harrier are best ARs
[1:48:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> god, she has an amazing design
[1:48:58] <%peachy996> Honestly I prefer the male turians
[1:48:59] <%AllenDeadman> woman
[1:49:04] <%Tarage> Oh hey Omega eh?
[1:49:05] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Looks like a Sith
[1:49:07] <Profmcstevie> I want her HOOD DOWN
[1:49:07] <%SWFanatic> lol
[1:49:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HA
[1:49:13] <Parapattern> Women exist
[1:49:13] <%Scevda> Shes hot
[1:49:13] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[1:49:13] <%RrenKrieg> Understandable. Carry on
[1:49:15] <PaperyHornet1013> try gun
[1:49:19] <%Tarage> Maps are big hard.
[1:49:24] <Gruhunchously> Greatly overestimating her memory
[1:49:28] <%Solid_Stro> It took 3 games and a DLC to get it finally
[1:49:29] <%dasmause> sucks you wont be able to keep either of them in main campaign
[1:49:31] <%coward_man> yes it does
[1:49:32] <%peachy996> But its good the female turians aren't just male models with female voices like the Salarians
[1:49:32] <mattynezz> Try the N7 Pirahna
[1:49:36] <mattynezz> It fucks
[1:49:41] <Gruhunchously> This sure is music
[1:49:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Attach a bayonet to you submachinegun LUL
[1:49:43] <Profmcstevie> Paige is gonna forget where her glasses are WHILE she's wearing them
[1:49:45] <%peachy996> Krogan are slightly different
[1:49:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is it strange that the only female turian and krogan are so covered up? I feel like it is but I can't articulate whyu
[1:49:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Oh christ
[1:49:51] <+GuilKato> can you upgrade their weapons? or set because npc
[1:49:52] <%cvp5127> but
[1:49:53] <godila2> give her typhoon pat
[1:49:53] <digaogrunge> GIVE TURIAN GUN
[1:49:54] <cpt_langosta> nah dude, accuse away
[1:49:56] <%faintsmile> no u totally can
[1:49:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Accuse Em Pat
[1:50:03] <%sporeian94> Cost too much money to design a new species
[1:50:04] <goodcraz> another unique model
[1:50:04] <%AllenDeadman> mhm
[1:50:09] <%RrenKrieg> give her a phaeston
[1:50:11] <%valriot> I imagine it was actually just budget
[1:50:15] <%watts121> Same team who thought women wouldn't be attracted to Garrus.
[1:50:15] <mattynezz> Or Volus
[1:50:15] <%faintsmile> they deserve it lol
[1:50:16] <+GuilKato> Pat she is teh ONE female Turian - they only have one!
[1:50:17] <DatAsuna> I mean were there ANY girl aliens but asari and quarians before 3?
[1:50:19] <%DashXero> Did someone Uno Reverse a genophage on the Turians or something?
[1:50:19] <blue8moon> especially considering turians are more egalitarian >.>
[1:50:19] <%coward_man> it wa super weird ESPECIALLY when Garrus talks about there being women in the turian military
[1:50:19] <MaritimeSpanker> No girl Volus either
[1:50:21] <Zombrocom> They didn't want to make another model I supose
[1:50:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> Have we seen female Salarians actually?
[1:50:22] <%kekkerscrew> Yell at them all you want
[1:50:23] <ARDM112> With Salarians and Krogan there at least was a lore reason for the rarity of females outside of their home systems
[1:50:24] <MaritimeSpanker> or Batarian women
[1:50:25] <%peachy996> It gets weird with female Salarians in Andromeda imo
[1:50:25] <robintact> @PatStaresAt They had drafts of women in Dragon Age with invisible high heels
[1:50:26] <%Deft_Thought> It's not accusatory, they were sexist.
[1:50:27] <%Scevda> And volus
[1:50:28] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Budget I guess. The aliens were all weirdly gender segregated
[1:50:29] <%sporeian94> It's the same reason why we never elcor or hanar walk until 3
[1:50:29] <%SpcOpsBear> Hell, we didn't see girl Salarians until Andromeda.
[1:50:29] <James_Quivers> There was an intense internal debate for years as to whether they should have bird boobies or not
[1:50:30] <Profmcstevie> Don't touch lore you're not happy to start writing I guess
[1:50:32] <%Scevda> And hanar
[1:50:34] <%Scevda> And elcor
[1:50:35] <%Solid_Stro> Literally it took the 3rd game to introduce female Krogan and Turians Pat
[1:50:36] <%andrewofbob> It's just not putting the effort into development, most, if not ALL of the aliens in 1 are one gender
[1:50:36] <%Scevda> And
[1:50:37] <wibbwobbler> Pretty silly
[1:50:38] <+cermo55> I know salarians are 1:9 on female to male, what's the turian ratio
[1:50:39] <mattynezz> Yeah, first female Salarian was the dalatras
[1:50:40] <%faintsmile> @LeiaSkynoober the dalatrass, but theyre basically identical to male ones
[1:50:41] <+dd44dostivei> no female battarian
[1:50:43] <%unhuggable1> ...or a female of any other race
[1:50:46] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat probably wasnt sexism, but Bioware was lazy and didnt want to craft a new model for lady birds
[1:50:48] <Deasmeister> Or girl barbarian or girl volus or elcor etc
[1:50:49] <%crassletter> it's a unique model and thats about as much as Ill give them
[1:50:49] <James_Quivers> hanar are probably sexless
[1:50:51] <%Treuan> Forget that, Elcor squadmate
[1:50:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> They could have just said that the turians are sexually undiamorphic if they wanted to be SUPER lazy
[1:50:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Female turian has Mammaries so they must Produce milk Kappa
[1:50:54] <Gruhunchously> No female vorcha
[1:50:58] <cpt_langosta> pat, you just jelly
[1:50:58] <%Tarage> Is Pat a Hanar?
[1:51:00] <MaritimeSpanker> Jellybros
[1:51:02] <%HotSauceFiend> did we ever see Female Volus?
[1:51:03] <%valriot> Jellyfish Cooch
[1:51:08] <%xcompleasedad> With your Vorcha lover
[1:51:08] <PaperyHornet1013> andromeda
[1:51:09] <%unhuggable1> where the Hanar ladies at
[1:51:12] <%kekkerscrew> I wanna ride an Elcor into battle
[1:51:12] <@Spydurman> make the sqaud in ME4 a Hanara, Elcor and Volus
[1:51:12] <%watts121> Vega was meant to be an Elcor, but they couldn't get the rig to work right.
[1:51:14] <dekkitout> A demolitionist hanar and a infiltrator elcor
[1:51:14] <%justcallmebobplease> What do Elcor girls look like?
[1:51:17] <%stantheman_97> at least the female salarians make sense since they make up 10% of the population and rarely leave salarian space
[1:51:18] <%AmericanSkidd> where is the weirdo alien gang
[1:51:20] <+SaphronBlackbourne> @HotSauceFiend nope
[1:51:22] <KeystoneA2> @unhuggable1 On the cover of Fornax
[1:51:23] <+MightyDuckShoes> I don't know. seems they wanted one model for all species to me. They ALL are functionally monogendered until 3.
[1:51:24] <MaritimeSpanker> so Hanar has...Hussy?
[1:51:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Elcor would break the game.Too good.
[1:51:25] <Profmcstevie> badasserly, I am going to kill these Bataraisn
[1:51:31] <%Tarage> Actually Pat is a Volus isn't he.
[1:51:31] <%X2Eliah> Sounded like a rat
[1:51:33] <%coward_man> how do you know you didn't meet hanar Elcor or Volus females?
[1:51:33] <@Spydurman> Hanar, Elcor and Volus squad up
[1:51:35] <%Treuan> Parakeet?
[1:51:35] <%X2Eliah> in distress
[1:51:39] <%peachy996> Good Words, Stream Man!
[1:51:46] <%Tarage> Pat's a Volus and Paige is a Quarian.
[1:51:53] <%stantheman_97> i assume hanar are hermaphroditic
[1:52:05] <%RealThiele> special words
[1:52:08] <cpt_langosta> sir beerus?
[1:52:12] <%jillyrancher> This DLC isnt very good. :(
[1:52:29] <%peachy996> It's not but it does have a lot of shootan
[1:52:32] <Sp3ctre48> We just been doing omega dlc?
[1:52:32] <DSD24> We got wounded!
[1:52:35] <Profmcstevie> It's just a small biotic RPG in your party
[1:52:36] <%Tarage> I played it and I honestly don't remember shit from it.
[1:52:44] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[1:52:45] <Parapattern> Girls night
[1:52:46] <KeystoneA2> Aria likes ladies more
[1:52:47] <SaltyAzteca> I mean sure LUL
[1:52:47] <%peachy996> It's one long shootfest which is unique to the rest of the content
[1:52:49] <%kekkerscrew> Guys can be part of girls night out
[1:52:49] <+cermo55> it super does
[1:52:50] <%SWFanatic> femsheps VA is so much better
[1:52:51] <%JamesCorck> TGS: Total Girl Squad.
[1:52:51] <%jillyrancher> BADASSFULLY, I am back.
[1:52:51] <Sp3ctre48> I just remember it being really fucking long
[1:52:53] <%KaiserMario> Are Turians mammals?
[1:52:54] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Nah Shep lil harem
[1:52:54] <%warpath1911> Aria likes femshep more
[1:52:54] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Girls get it done
[1:52:56] <%coward_man> the whole series is super fun with femshep, I advise doing it some time
[1:52:57] <PaperyHornet1013> women do be like that
[1:52:57] <James_Quivers> This is the true Ladies Night DLC that DMC5 never had
[1:52:57] <%alphonseisbest> Thats kinda sexist tho
[1:52:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Shhhh
[1:52:58] <MaritimeSpanker> NOW who's bein' like that
[1:52:58] <%unhuggable1> yeah
[1:52:58] <%RrenKrieg> citadel dlc feels that alot more
[1:53:00] <Gruhunchously> Instead it's broshep awkwardly being the third wheel
[1:53:05] <%NateyBeak> hey gurrrrls whats garrus's balls smell liiiiike
[1:53:07] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Femshep >>>>> ManShep any day
[1:53:11] <%jillyrancher> Citadel is girls night
[1:53:13] <%unhuggable1> honestly the whole game is better as fem shep
[1:53:16] <DSD24> Wait is Aria a Girl Boss
[1:53:17] <+GuilKato> Shepard is probably thinking of asking if lady turian can make baby garruses as you will need them later
[1:53:17] <%Tarage> WHOS TALKING
[1:53:24] <SaltyAzteca> Glamorous, Inquisitive, Ready to take a Lick out of crime
[1:53:24] <%jillyrancher> I like them both
[1:53:25] <James_Quivers> GASLIGHT. GATLING GUNS. GIRLBOSS.
[1:53:25] <%RrenKrieg> it was clear that the citadel DLC is heavily weighed on femshep
[1:53:29] <Deasmeister> Noo tell me about that garrus Gussy
[1:53:32] <Gruhunchously> @unhuggable1 No Tali romance tho :(
[1:53:33] <Sp3ctre48> manshep worse automatically because you can't kiss Garrus
[1:53:34] <%Solid_Stro> We got this instead of helping Garrus rescue his father and sister DLC coxWat
[1:53:35] <%LeiaSkynoober> What guys think girls night is Girls night is actually very homoerotic
[1:53:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Kill the man with a diploma Pat
[1:53:43] <Make_me_mad> Jen Hale is a much better voice actor, so it's kind of unfair for man shep.
[1:53:45] <%unhuggable1> @unhuggable1 yeah but garrus
[1:53:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Five years in civil engineering to die in space
[1:53:58] <MaritimeSpanker> I am still peeved that Shiala was cut as a romance option in 3

[1:54:18] <DSD24> Shiala was that nice Green Asari right?
[1:54:19] <%jillyrancher> @cpt_langosta No
[1:54:19] <%RrenKrieg> @Make_me_mad mark meer still did amazingly well
[1:54:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Where's garrus when you need him?
[1:54:24] <%coward_man> da baby

[1:55:19] <%peyodogo> mark meer did great in all roles aside from shepard, which is really inconsistent imo
[1:55:19] <%RrenKrieg> @AmuserName cerbussy
[1:55:30] <Gruhunchously> To be fair, Jen Hale has a lot more experience than Mark Meer does
[1:55:36] <MaritimeSpanker> why not use a heavy weapon for it?

[1:55:54] <%FunkyStreams> CRONCH
[1:55:55] <%CatRidder> 14 month
[1:55:55] <%HairballCT> it WAS bad LUL
[1:55:55] <BurdRightsActivist> UNGA DENIED LUL
[1:55:56] <Gruhunchously> The animations in this game...aren't great
[1:55:56] <godila2> finally LUL
[1:55:59] <mattynezz> You have to back peddle LUL
[1:56:02] <Sp3ctre48> Most of the sync kills do look bad LUL
[1:56:04] <%anAngryHamster> Time to punch in for my.shitty retail job. Kill some Batarians for me Pat
[1:56:04] <James_Quivers> it's a made for MP mechanic, basically
[1:56:06] <%peachy996> I've forgotten what the Atlas Sync Kill looks like
[1:56:08] <digaogrunge> I NEVER SAW THAT
[1:56:10] <Gruhunchously> That's what happens when you have a 14 month dev cycle
[1:56:11] <%Scevda> Behold the reason why you dont do thay
[1:56:13] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt You can just activate the controls and ignore the enemies
[1:56:14] <%FunkyStreams> he breaks your biotic spine
[1:56:18] <+OneGorillionDollars> Its a bioware game, of course the animations are bad
[1:56:19] <+vaderxyz1970> No Garrus to melt
[1:56:26] <%alphonseisbest> @Gruhunchously the animations in ALL biowares games are bad
[1:56:30] <goodcraz> is it true that sprint isnt faster in this game it just shakes the camera
[1:56:32] <%peachy996> While rare the Brute kill still looks worse. I never know what the hell they're doing
[1:56:32] <%DrTomT18> I don't like Femsheps voice. Jen hale is a good VA but Femshep always sounds board
[1:56:35] <%andrewofbob> Given the rate we're going, I'd put money on Pat dying to the Pretorian instant kill as well
[1:56:47] <%RrenKrieg> @goodcraz nah you actually go faster
[1:56:56] <MaritimeSpanker> @andrewofbob no Banshee instant bing yet tho
[1:56:59] <PaperyHornet1013> no recoil
[1:56:59] <%SpcOpsBear> See it's shit like THAT that I played a Sentinel in ME2/ME3
[1:57:01] <%alphonseisbest> @DrTomT18 same tbh
[1:57:04] <Sp3ctre48> Hale is great until you play Renegade Shep, then she sounds kinda weird to me
[1:57:05] <%faintsmile> whats this camera work
[1:57:11] <Latija> i cannot tell what's even happening
[1:57:14] <%kekkerscrew> Why does the game assume anyone at all would use that rifle?  or Any rifle
[1:57:19] <Sp3ctre48> The dude store
[1:57:22] <%coward_man> look, a lot of humans are spacists
[1:57:24] <%JamesCorck> They have a spawn point factory.
[1:57:25] <Gruhunchously> My feeling is that Mark Meer got progressively better across the trilogy, whereas Jen Hale kinda got worse
[1:57:29] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's like watching an action sequence in a Transformers movie
[1:57:29] <James_Quivers> From enslaving human colonies and reaperizing the people
[1:57:30] <Mecha_G> they did Nyreen wrong
[1:57:30] <penitentpendant> "When a dude and a dudette drink a whole lot..."
[1:57:31] <%alphonseisbest> @Sp3ctre48 wut? her paragon is terrible tho

[1:57:47] <%RrenKrieg> yeah... needs a wider fov
[1:57:47] <%JamesCorck> It's the chaos, it's fine.
[1:57:49] <mattynezz> ANDROMEDA
[1:57:49] <%Scevda> @gruhunchously a bit. Hale was still good overall.

[1:58:11] <blue8moon> LUL
[1:58:12] <%SWFanatic> what a senseless loss of batarians

[1:58:18] <Mecha_G> which one was tech/biotic?
[1:58:19] <%peachy996> The pacing in this DLC is a mess
[1:58:20] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> It's sad knowing these guys are just branwashed slaves
[1:58:22] <+OneGorillionDollars> this scene feels like we are supposed to be sorry for the Cerberus soldiers?
[1:58:22] <BurdRightsActivist> He shoulda thumbs up

[1:58:29] <studleydoorite> no head of state has ever had such a nice butt

[2:00:53] <MaritimeSpanker> Dont be batarian racist
[2:00:54] <%peachy996> This only proves my theory that the special eyes only pop up in cutscenes where you are doing the shooty
[2:01:00] <Aiutare47> Bray’s my boy though
[2:01:02] <MaritimeSpanker> they have enough problems going on right now lol
[2:01:04] <%jillyrancher> it's like Carrie was half asleep when they recorded this lol

[2:01:20] <BurdRightsActivist> I'm not spacist, I just think Batarians shouldn't have rights
[2:01:21] <%kekkerscrew> Do Batarians have enough people to be a race anymore?
[2:01:23] <Profmcstevie> Whos gonna stop me the Batarians? Most of em are dead get reeekt
[2:01:24] <@commanderclaw> Ashley would be proud of your Batarian racism Pat

[2:01:45] <Sp3ctre48> Who said that

[2:02:11] <CrimsonGargoyle> @MaritimeSpanker were have you been for 90% of this playthrough LUL
[2:02:15] <%Solid_Stro> Use your special eyes Pat
[2:02:16] <%XzileGaming> Spassholes
[2:02:17] <SeruraRenge> There's no point with calling pat a Batarian racist because being accused of being a racist only has bite if you're not a racist and thus need to defend themselves because racists don't care that they're called racists
[2:02:18] <%Tarage> Hub city~
[2:02:19] <%X2Eliah> This area so big, it even has its own fetch quests
[2:02:23] <Gruhunchously> He needs to go to Tosche Station to pick up the power inverters
[2:02:33] <%Tarage> GET THEM POWER CONVERTERS SLAVE
[2:02:37] <%jillyrancher> I bet female Batarians are hot
[2:02:47] <Gruhunchously> Is she talking to Paige?
[2:02:50] <%faintsmile> oh yay bioware fetch quests. andromeda was riddled with these
[2:02:52] <%peachy996> He has the PAige skill
[2:02:53] <DatAsuna> ironic

[2:03:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> @jillyrancher bet you'd be eyeing them all day
[2:03:09] <MaritimeSpanker> @MaritimeSpanker enjoying his casual batarianism, I'm mostly just joshing. I do like the batarians, but man they're funny to rag at
[2:03:09] <Parapattern> In the Mainframe

[2:03:56] <%jillyrancher> @zhenthrim213 TehePelo
[2:03:58] <studleydoorite> everyone in this world is either wearing an exosuit or leather s&m gear
[2:03:59] <cpt_langosta> wow, that asari is afflicted with hologram clipping through her leg. sucks to be her.
[2:04:04] <MaritimeSpanker> Not a lotta krogan here, huh
[2:04:05] <%jillyrancher> later
[2:04:11] <%alphonseisbest> there is, u missed it
[2:04:13] <MaritimeSpanker> you'd think some of them would want the fight
[2:04:25] <%jillyrancher> I feel like the main team was making Citadel while the B team made this
[2:04:28] <Gruhunchously> Big brain time

[2:04:59] <%stantheman_97> looks like the space station from sonic adventure 2
[2:05:01] <Chester_goes_Berserk> This dlc would be saved with just putting metroids in it
[2:05:04] <MaritimeSpanker> @Solid_Stro a wise move indeed
[2:05:06] <Gruhunchously> Is the audio out of synch for anyone else?
[2:05:06] <%XzileGaming> y cant metroid crawl
[2:05:07] <zhenthrim213> whos fault is that
[2:05:08] <tanarath> MY GREAT PLAN SUCKED, HMMM
[2:05:12] <Profmcstevie> Shepard I FUCKED UP AAHHH I'm so blue and dumb
[2:05:23] <%WhereIsWill> where there any runner up icons for the brand?
[2:05:25] <%faintsmile> seduce them with your beautiful eyes shepard
[2:05:27] <PaperyHornet1013> BRAY
[2:05:35] <Sp3ctre48> Bray come on
[2:05:41] <PaperyHornet1013> butt
[2:05:42] <%Solid_Stro> The power of friendship is with Shepard always
[2:05:46] <Gruhunchously> Damn it Bray!
[2:05:55] <%peachy996> OH NO WE CAN'T TRUST THIS CLEARLY TRUSTABLE TURIAN
[2:05:55] <SaltyAzteca> He had four eyes, none of them SPECIAL
[2:06:01] <%alphonseisbest> FUCKING BATARIANS
[2:06:04] <%peachy996> It's so silly
[2:06:09] <@Ranryu692> I like Bray, even though he's a fuckup and an asshole
[2:06:09] <%alphonseisbest> Can't do any thing right
[2:06:15] <BurdRightsActivist> why are they on high charity
[2:06:21] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Find her using your special eyes
[2:06:22] <@Spydurman> Batarians, 4 eyes and still blind as fuck
[2:06:25] <%SWFanatic> try pirahna?
[2:06:28] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Just like a batarain
[2:06:41] <%andrewofbob> Does pat have any ultralight materials mods?
[2:06:41] <%Solid_Stro> Any character who wears a hood indoors can’t be trusted c4sageLUL
[2:06:44] <@Ranryu692> you'll get a better, lighter pistol eventually
[2:06:45] <Profmcstevie> Pat "it's not deleting things on Hardcore" Boivin, the saddest man
[2:06:47] <cpt_langosta> this is my first time seeing this dlc and, honestly, it seems fucking terrible
[2:06:49] <%stantheman_97> 4 eyes and none of this special
[2:06:58] <Gruhunchously> Here's an idea, a game with Detective Vision but everytime you use it your character's eyes go like *that*
[2:07:00] <%Treuan> Such devastation
[2:07:01] <%Dakuu75> Is she blue or purple?
[2:07:07] <%peachy996> It's both terrible and fun and boring
[2:07:09] <Sp3ctre48> I hating these Talon guys in the multiplayer
[2:07:13] <KeystoneA2> @Dakuu75 blurple
[2:07:13] <%peachy996> It's a mixed bag
[2:07:15] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @Dakuu75 She's Blurple.
[2:07:18] <Sp3ctre48> *hated
[2:07:21] <%Solid_Stro> @dakuu75 Depends on the lighting
[2:07:23] <Gruhunchously> Shepard you should know the answer to that question
[2:07:25] <%Dakuu75> <3
[2:07:29] <%hereiam407> Omeger
[2:07:33] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Now you're the one sending mooks to their death :O
[2:07:38] <@Ranryu692> it's so lame that you can't romance Aria
[2:07:53] <The_Betus> 140 raiders from The_Betus have joined! 
[2:07:53] <@Spydurman> Aria feels like a perfect Renegade romance
[2:07:56] <KeystoneA2> @Ranryu692 Nyreen beat us to it
[2:07:57] <billymandias> It's a raaaaid
[2:07:57] <%hereiam407> Aria would be a cool romance and team partner
[2:07:58] <DSD24> Eh there are better Asari ladies
[2:08:07] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype
[2:08:09] <%hereiam407> Like who?
[2:08:10] <%kekkerscrew> @Ranryu692 Eh I like it, every major character being romancable would be weird
[2:08:14] <%SpcOpsBear> OH HEY IT'S BIOTIC DRUGS
[2:08:15] <%peachy996> There are worse Asari too
[2:08:15] <olm46> The first rule of Omega is sadly that you don't get to fuck her.
[2:08:18] <MaritimeSpanker> for easier sniff acess
[2:08:19] <Hoot_Patoots> betusCas
[2:08:20] <DatAsuna> @Ranryu692 let's just say she likes femshep a lot more
[2:08:21] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Spydurman she sure is!
[2:08:23] <cpt_langosta> red squand?
[2:08:25] <Latija> profit during a siege?
[2:08:32] <Make_me_mad> There are tons of people you should have been able to romance. Like, literally any Krogan. Come on you cowards!
[2:08:36] <Gruhunchously> Lady, the station is being invaded
[2:08:36] <@Spydurman> @PatStaresAt FYI Betus raided you
[2:08:37] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I would only want to romance her as FemShep
[2:08:47] <%SpcOpsBear> Red Sand is a drug allegedly made using eezo.
[2:08:47] <@Ranryu692> GuyShep is undeserving of her scorn
[2:08:48] <PaperyHornet1013> what race was arias father
[2:08:58] <Gruhunchously> l33t haX0r
[2:09:01] <%XzileGaming> Pat will see it with his 20/20 vision, dont worry @Spydurman
[2:09:03] <%SpcOpsBear> It gives non-biotics temporary biotic powers from the high.
[2:09:03] <%kekkerscrew> Hack The Planet!
[2:09:04] <Ekaelis> @Latija Reminds of Bronn talk about thieves during a siege
[2:09:08] <%peachy996> Probably Krogan
[2:09:14] <%peachy996> Find it odd she has Carnage
[2:09:15] <DatAsuna> @Ranryu692 well the irony is that guy shep is the only one getting scorn in *that* scenario
[2:09:20] <@Spydurman> @XzileGaming LUL
[2:09:21] <oz19999> @SpcOpsBear so it's like the robo blood in Detroit
[2:09:31] <PaperyHornet1013> send it down get on it
[2:09:35] <%SpcOpsBear> @SpcOpsBear ... what?
[2:09:38] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I just want the powerful lady to belittle me and give me presents
[2:09:43] <mattynezz> Big puzzle
[2:09:49] <%peachy996> Wouldn't be shocked if she had Batarian blood in her either though
[2:09:59] <%peachy996> Well "blood"
[2:10:09] <@Spydurman> if there are Betus folks here who can't chat Followers mode is on cause of all the bot raids
[2:10:15] <+cermo55> remember pat any incomplete sidequests at the end of the DLC will never leave the mission menu, and you cannot purchase missing items later either
[2:10:16] <cpt_langosta> shepard cannot figure out the difference between pick up item and stick his ass to a crate
[2:10:16] <%hereiam407> Man, is Mass Effect 3 30% DLC?
[2:10:21] <blackjack8182> Baka shepard
[2:10:30] <+cermo55> @hereiam407 yes
[2:10:35] <DSD24> Ahz is a cool name
[2:10:39] <%walternatorz> you knew what you were getting into
[2:10:42] <Gruhunchously> @hereiam407 yes
[2:10:44] <%hereiam407> It's ridicul
[2:10:47] <%jillyrancher> Doesnt help not much is happening
[2:10:49] <MaritimeSpanker> Patadad
[2:10:49] <%hereiam407> -ulous
[2:10:57] <MaritimeSpanker> datapad backwards
[2:10:57] <%jillyrancher> Please long stream though
[2:11:00] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 not quite, but Omega and Citadel are each a few hours
[2:11:11] <SaltyAzteca> Something you missed
[2:11:17] <@Ranryu692> did Pat just walk past a prompt?
[2:11:19] <%hereiam407> @Ranryu692 And Javik
[2:11:23] <SaltyAzteca> Yeah
[2:11:24] <%jillyrancher> Citadel can be much longer than Omega
[2:11:34] <%SilverReamalus> missed a thing
[2:11:36] <%jillyrancher> just depends
[2:11:38] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 before you opened the door
[2:11:41] <%peachy996> yeah that's the really crappy part about Omega
[2:11:42] <%SpcOpsBear> crates
[2:11:44] <%alphonseisbest> only K I L L
[2:11:51] <%XzileGaming> Pat wouldnt miss anything. no never.
[2:11:58] <mattynezz> Next to the terminal
[2:12:00] <ARDM112> @jillyrancher Not the actual story part of the Citadel
[2:12:00] <BurdRightsActivist> You didn't.
[2:12:00] <%jillyrancher> SHOOTY BANG BANG
[2:12:01] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 sorry, meant to close out of the reply before typing that lol
[2:12:02] <%Daxalog> is Omega just detroit?
[2:12:02] <28moogles> Omega DLC is pretty boring imo, yeah. This is the team that went onto Andromeda, I believe.
[2:12:02] <SaltyAzteca> Are you serious, he cant get back cuz of that dip[?
[2:12:03] <%SpcOpsBear> bad steppy, can't go back?
[2:12:06] <@Spydurman> LUL
[2:12:07] <studleydoorite> crates jermaVenus
[2:12:07] <%SpcOpsBear> oh nvm
[2:12:12] <%hereiam407> Yay
[2:12:16] <%hereiam407> 1 credit
[2:12:16] <mattynezz> too late
[2:12:16] <bearwagon> LUL
[2:12:17] <%SpcOpsBear> ANYTHING COULD BE IMPORTANT
[2:12:18] <%SWFanatic> lol
[2:12:19] <%XzileGaming> you maybe
[2:12:22] <SaltyAzteca> Lore! LUL
[2:12:24] <Sp3ctre48> Chaaaaaaat
[2:12:25] <PaperyHornet1013> 100% tho
[2:12:29] <MaritimeSpanker> Mindgoblins do be like that
[2:12:34] <BurdRightsActivist> That didn't look intentional AT ALL
[2:12:34] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Ohhh the omega dlc is setting in
[2:12:35] <Latija> yeah this seems lame
[2:12:39] <Ekaelis> It's middling
[2:12:40] <%hereiam407> Looks like mostly ladders
[2:12:42] <%dooscent> yeah it's boring
[2:12:44] <DatAsuna> Everyone says it's the worst DLC
[2:12:44] <Sp3ctre48> It's very long and uninteresting
[2:12:44] <%faintsmile> its pretty bland
[2:12:46] <%Tarage> Citidel is better
[2:12:47] <tattleworm> this is the weak one, the other two are much better
[2:12:47] <Maids4lyfe> it's not supposed to
[2:12:48] <%Treuan> Hell yeah Skyboxes
[2:12:49] <PaperyHornet1013> tussy
[2:12:50] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 but Javik only has the one short mission, so it's hard to say how much he actually takes up in the story
[2:12:50] <%YakumoYomi> Aria's hot, tho
[2:12:50] <%dooscent> lady turian owns tho
[2:12:51] <%andrewofbob> The tussy is just about the only good part
[2:12:52] <%peachy996> Yeah
[2:12:53] <mattynezz> It's the worst DLC for sure
[2:12:54] <%ComfortableStranger> keep playing bro
[2:12:54] <olm46> Is this the least good one?
[2:12:54] <ARDM112> You'll love the missions in Leviathan then LUL
[2:12:56] <%Treasure_Vault> What if we replaced the party members you liked with some other people?
[2:12:57] <DSD24> I'm a sucker for more gameplay so I had a good time with it
[2:12:59] <%Solid_Stro> It has Tussy
[2:12:59] <%crassletter> citidel is WAY better
[2:12:59] <+battlepope99> Evening everyone :)
[2:13:03] <%Daxalog> The skybox is very pretty
[2:13:06] <Maids4lyfe> it's the worst dlc, it's to get it over with
[2:13:08] <MaritimeSpanker> MASS ELYSIUM! DISCO EFFECT!
[2:13:10] <%Treasure_Vault> Solve everything with pazaak
[2:13:16] <DatAsuna> omega is unaminously agreed to be the worst
[2:13:16] <Hoaxfish> Andromeda Elysium
[2:13:17] <%peachy996> It'll get slightly more interesting later on but then it'll go back to being boring
[2:13:20] <James_Quivers> It's the weakest one in this game, I'd say, mostly combat focused whereas the others are more story/character based
[2:13:20] <+GuilKato> Pat this DLC gives Aria her own female Garrus! everyone needs a garrus
[2:13:21] <studleydoorite> they should've made a DLC where the graphics artists got to write, and the writers got to make graphics and art
[2:13:23] <DSD24> So like a C sec Detective game?
[2:13:24] <%hereiam407> @Ranryu692 Gives you a better impression of the Protheans, instead of Liara's ideals. I appreciated that.
[2:13:24] <dekkitout> Doesn't seem like much further than Team Renegade- the DLC
[2:13:27] <BurdRightsActivist> UNGA
[2:13:27] <MaritimeSpanker> DICK WHISKEY, MASTER SPECTER
[2:13:34] <Gruhunchously> Bioware has a big problem with DLCs that are 70% the same combat you've already been doing in the base game
[2:13:38] <@Ranryu692> the Omega dlc would be better if they cut the combat in half
[2:13:40] <tanarath> It's mostly worth it for the female turian character.
[2:13:44] <%peachy996> Be glad you spent a day on this instead of last week where you wanted to do at the end of the stream
[2:13:51] <+Ropcord> hey, disco has shooting in it. you can shoot a child!
[2:13:52] <cpt_langosta> ME3 reminds me of Prometheus: pretty good first half, but then...
[2:13:54] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I enjoyed this DLC, the gameplay of this game is fun so I'm satisfied with more
[2:14:06] <Sp3ctre48> It only really exists because someone at Bioware thinks Aria is the coolest ever
[2:14:09] <%jillyrancher> You wanna do a combat section for 3-4 hours straight?
[2:14:09] <%SWFanatic> you did 77% of it
[2:14:10] <mattynezz> Nope, MORE
[2:14:13] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I would love it if the new Mass Effect was 80% Disco with just a bit of shooting
[2:14:16] <%crassletter> yeah omega is the weakest part dlc
[2:14:16] <%hereiam407> There'd be a cutscene or something
[2:14:16] <%ComfortableStranger> @Ranryu692 or double it
[2:14:21] <@Spydurman> eh fuck it, just fetch quests
[2:14:28] <%alphonseisbest> @SaphronBlackbourne Right, the claases are soo much fun in 3
[2:14:28] <DSD24> @jillyrancher Yes cause the combat in ME 3 was great
[2:14:29] <jorniev> RULE OF 3
[2:14:31] <SaltyAzteca> Aria calm down LUL
[2:14:33] <28moogles> Yeah, doubled checked. This DLC is by the team that went on to Andromeda. lol
[2:14:36] <Gruhunchously> The skybox is nice
[2:14:37] <%hereiam407> Sleepy
[2:14:38] <oz19999> alright
[2:14:39] <%jillyrancher> This music is pretty lame
[2:14:55] <DatAsuna> @SaphronBlackbourne yeah but the MP serves that up but better
[2:15:07] <%JamesCorck> Pat if this DLC hasn't won you already, it never will.
[2:15:08] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 oh yeah, and it's outrageous that it wasn't in the base game, but just as far as what percentage of the game it accounts for I'm not sure how to quantify it compared to the mission-based DLCs
[2:15:12] <%jillyrancher> @dsd24 Yeah but I wouldnt want to do a non stop combat section with barely any story or conversation
[2:15:17] <%SpcOpsBear> I actually miss the LOKI mechs and their stupid voice lines
[2:15:21] <%JamesCorck> Because that's pretty much the whole DLC.
[2:15:24] <Sp3ctre48> I mean, I love the combat too but in the story mode, I'd like the missions to have more substance, I can play the multiplayer for good gameplay
[2:15:26] <studleydoorite> yeah the music has felt out of place this whole stream
[2:15:28] <%peachy996> Omega should have been an MP map
[2:15:28] <%jillyrancher> @28moogles Really?
[2:15:29] <%SpcOpsBear> "Please reconsider your aggressive behavior."
[2:15:35] <%Nobrev> Nobrev subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[2:15:38] <%hereiam407> @Ranryu692 I forgot Leviathon
[2:15:44] <oz19999> If this hadn't been DLC, this whole thing would've been a much shorter story chapter
[2:15:52] <DSD24> @jillyrancher Oh I missread your question yeah that doesn't sound very good I would still need some story stuff inbetween
[2:16:00] <%hereiam407> No, generic corridors it is
[2:16:04] <Ekaelis> I find it odd that Hacker has no name at all, she's just there to give you this quest and nothing more
[2:16:07] <mattynezz> This WAS a story mission, it got cut
[2:16:11] <%X2Eliah> this dlc has, like, maybe 2-3 good moments. otherwise its really combat heavy
[2:16:11] <28moogles> @jillyrancher Yep. Omega was by BioWare Montreal team who did Andromeda after this.
[2:16:13] <%cvp5127> no shoot gun
[2:16:16] <DatAsuna> the only thing you really learn in this DLC is that female turians are biotics more often than men
[2:16:19] <%ComfortableStranger> Pat wants an all elcor DLC
[2:16:21] <Gruhunchously> Mass Effect 2's missions were paced pretty well in that regard
[2:16:22] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 yeah, but while it's super interesting (imo), I think the missions only total like an hour
[2:16:22] <%peachy996> I feel like this would have been better as a multiplier co op mission
[2:16:22] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:16:31] <+cermo55> @ComfortableStranger we all do
[2:16:33] <%JoshManVGH> Wait you DON'T want Mass Effect to be Call of Duty?
[2:16:35] <%SWFanatic> pat forgot about the over cover grabs
[2:16:36] <penitentpendant> The genuine value of "World Building" in an RPG
[2:16:36] <ARDM112> @oz19999 It was actually going to be as big of a section as Tuchanka or Rannoch before they cut it. With several side missions. But Omega would've also been a real hub.
[2:16:37] <tanarath> or omega & how poverty exists in the galaxy
[2:16:48] <oz19999> go Plus Ulra PAt
[2:16:56] <dekkitout> Like an actual dbz character
[2:17:02] <%jillyrancher> The final mission is also a big combat sequence. though that has the context of the desperate final battle and conversations between.
[2:17:04] <%hereiam407> @Ranryu692 I'm a little more concerned about the missing lore, which is pretty big. You're right about the time, probably more like 7%.
[2:17:06] <%alphonseisbest> YEA NOW UR THINKING LIKA A VANGOD
[2:17:06] <blackjack8182> The same team that made Andromeda made this DLC
[2:17:15] <%ComfortableStranger> dat glass
[2:17:20] <%hereiam407> Fog it up
[2:17:22] <cpt_langosta> KISS. THE GLASS.
[2:17:25] <Gruhunchously> Breath on her helmet and draw a smiley face on it
[2:17:26] <%hereiam407> Does she have a defogger?
[2:17:27] <BurdRightsActivist> QUSSY
[2:17:29] <%alphonseisbest> EW
[2:17:31] <SneakyCorpse> just salivate all over it
[2:17:32] <%hereiam407> Or shield wiper?
[2:17:37] <MaritimeSpanker> Is Tali the real Interspecies reviewer?
[2:17:44] <%jillyrancher> @dsd24 Its cool dude
[2:17:45] <28moogles> @blackjack8182 That's what I just said. lol
[2:17:50] <oz19999> have her vent her sweat vapor into you mouth
[2:17:51] <%hereiam407> Just 'Thanks'
[2:17:53] <%jillyrancher> tali is into aliens
[2:17:54] <@Ranryu692> @hereiam407 yeah, when you said 30% I was just thinking game time, but as for how much lore is in them you're right that it's pretty substantial
[2:18:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Thanks.
[2:18:04] <MaritimeSpanker> Same "thanks" too
[2:18:06] <%peachy996> same voice too
[2:18:08] <%X2Eliah> Andromeda feelings
[2:18:09] <%andrewofbob> Thanks
[2:18:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Thanks
[2:18:15] <%alphonseisbest> @blackjack8182 everyone has been saying that the whole time
[2:18:16] <Gruhunchously> The very least they could do was have some banter between Aria and Shepard
[2:18:16] <Sp3ctre48> You're welcome "Injured Talon"
[2:18:16] <DatAsuna> omega reuses a lot of assets, even from the swtor mmo
[2:18:20] <mattynezz> They're all the same guy too
[2:18:28] <BurdRightsActivist> WRONG GUN
[2:18:31] <%JamesCorck> Pat, can you tell they cobbled this DLC together in a few months after the game's release?
[2:18:32] <Gruhunchously> But maybe Carrie Ann Moss was paying by the hour
[2:18:36] <%faintsmile> oh finally her hood is off
[2:18:37] <%ComfortableStranger> female turian bra!
[2:18:40] <Sp3ctre48> Man they suck
[2:18:43] <DSD24> Phaeston is a cool gun
[2:18:44] <%peachy996> Haha! the boobs were fake the whole time
[2:18:44] <@Ranryu692> oh yeah, I forgot that they finally gave us a female Turian in this DLC
[2:18:44] <%Treuan> Hell yeah
[2:18:45] <cpt_langosta> She should be saying "Batter to death them!" over and over...
[2:18:46] <MaritimeSpanker> wait
[2:18:46] <Gruhunchously> Woe these animation are weak
[2:18:49] <%Wallabri> sofieLove sofieLove sofieLove
[2:18:52] <MaritimeSpanker> did the TECH turian just use BIOTICS?
[2:18:53] <%peachy996> Take that Turian Boob enthusiasts
[2:18:54] <jorniev> OH MY GOD TORTURE AND MURDER OF CRIMINALS!? ONLY WE CAN DO THAT
[2:18:57] <%MidnightBurst12> slapped him with the rifle
[2:19:00] <stormhawk9891> Also note that she's a TURIAN biotic
[2:19:04] <%Solid_Stro> The game always defaults you holding the Avenger
[2:19:04] <%hereiam407> I forgot, do female turians have breasts?
[2:19:06] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @MaritimeSpanker She's a dualy
[2:19:06] <DSD24> Her design with the hood is good too
[2:19:09] <PaperyHornet1013> TUSSY
[2:19:19] <MaritimeSpanker> @MaritimeSpanker oh shitd, double threat
[2:19:24] <%jillyrancher> Aria you sound so fucking bored
[2:19:33] <%peachy996> Okay Aria's slow line delivery is NOT helping this DLC

[2:19:42] <%Conscript_Gary> the mandibles are the best part of the turian design it's true
[2:19:45] <%Sigma_190_Beta> She has both Biotics and Tech, just to keep that in your head.
[2:19:48] <DSD24> Thank you Boss!
[2:19:48] <KeystoneA2> Her cat eyes are cool
[2:19:50] <%Puhff> Baaaaby
[2:19:52] <studleydoorite> if Turian women have boobs they're just two chitinous sharp plates
[2:19:53] <jorniev> THIS LADY IS STEALING THE SHOW
[2:19:55] <%Piemen99> OLD BABY
[2:19:55] <%jillyrancher> Myyyyyyyy Myyyyyyyy......
[2:19:58] <susukouhai> STIMKY BABYY!!
[2:20:08] <%hereiam407> Female durians do not have breasts, but they have a chest bump in the same place.
[2:20:08] <Gruhunchously> Never play a drinking game for every time someone says 'outpost' in this series
[2:20:13] <%Solid_Stro> Can you do anything crazy with them mandibles? Kappa
[2:20:14] <%hereiam407> turians*
[2:20:17] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Nyreen was a stick in the mud for me, though I play more Renegade
[2:20:19] <%ComfortableStranger> psaWink psaPorgmo psaBlep psaElmo
[2:20:24] <%jillyrancher> Nyreen is wife material
[2:20:25] <%Dakuu75> She has a very pleasent voice
[2:20:25] <+Ropcord> turian boobs are actually just extra beaks complete with nostrils
[2:20:33] <studleydoorite> female durians LUL
[2:20:34] <cpt_langosta> why do all aliens in mass effect follow the same sexual dimorphism exhibited by humans? so disappointing...
[2:20:35] <%ComfortableStranger> rule 34
[2:20:36] <%JamesCorck> there is.
[2:20:37] <DatAsuna> there is, in the artbooks
[2:20:38] <%peachy996> There's concept art I think
[2:20:39] <jorniev> THERE IS
[2:20:40] <%Mattais88> there is
[2:20:40] <%andrewofbob> There are concept art pics, yes
[2:20:41] <MaritimeSpanker> Juicy, is what they look like
[2:20:42] <%JamesCorck> There is concept art and screenshots.
[2:20:42] <@QueequegTheater> It's another, smaller set of armor
[2:20:43] <%X2Eliah> There's certainly fanfic
[2:20:45] <%stantheman_97> i think there's art?
[2:20:45] <Sp3ctre48> I'm sure it looks gross
[2:20:46] <Vekek_> I think there's some early ME1 concept art about it.
[2:20:46] <BurdRightsActivist> rule 34
[2:20:46] <%peachy996> Naked Male Turians
[2:20:47] <%Tarage> Remember Tali's face?
[2:20:47] <%YakumoYomi> @Ropcord NotLikeThis
[2:20:47] <mattynezz> There is
[2:20:48] <%hereiam407> @Ropcord LUL
[2:20:48] <%XzileGaming> Xenofilia
[2:20:48] <Gruhunchously> There is
[2:20:50] <MaritimeSpanker> or so my research tells me
[2:20:52] <%JamesCorck> They look like weird chitin space crickets.
[2:20:52] <%Tarage> They probably didn't think very hard.
[2:20:53] <mattynezz> Me1 Concept art
[2:20:54] <+GuilKato> Pat is thinking about turian SpaceBirdMan boobies?
[2:20:55] <@Ranryu692> @Ropcord thank you for this image -_-
[2:20:57] <SneakyCorpse> LUL
[2:20:58] <+PenmanLupine> SFM was made for this
[2:20:59] <Parapattern> I'd think they'd look sorta skeletonish
[2:21:05] <%Solid_Stro> That’s what Rule 34 is for Pat
[2:21:12] <%Puhff> it's just teeth
[2:21:17] <Gruhunchously> It makes shotgun go boom
[2:21:18] <%walternatorz> iirc they look like they've sucked in their gut and have bone rib cages
[2:21:23] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I think there's a naked female Turian in Andromeda you romance, but it's Andromeda
[2:21:26] <%ComfortableStranger> you can play as a female turian in me3MP
[2:21:27] <studleydoorite> do you think durians have r34?
[2:21:27] <%walternatorz> boney rib cages*
[2:21:28] <%hereiam407> Turians could smash a rock
[2:21:28] <%JamesCorck> There is early concept art for ME1.
[2:21:32] <%YakumoYomi> Rule34 IS the design document Kappa
[2:21:33] <%JamesCorck> I don't think so, no.
[2:21:34] <%Conscript_Gary> you guys warned pat about the hacker quest right
[2:21:34] <jorniev> YES
[2:21:34] <SaltyAzteca> Anatomy of a Turian
[2:21:36] <DatAsuna> there is annotated naked turian concept art yes
[2:21:36] <%andrewofbob> They did do the concept art
[2:21:36] <%Piemen99> Yes r34
[2:21:38] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  The answer is yes and its  flat and broing.
[2:21:42] <%TheQuadrupleS> There is concept art
[2:21:46] <%peachy996> Oh "Care"? No.
[2:21:47] <%stantheman_97> there's concept art
[2:21:48] <Chester_goes_Berserk> They would in ME1, dunno about the sequels
[2:21:57] <%X2Eliah> oh look more combat
[2:22:02] <%Puhff> Turians are the most underwritten race so, prolly not
[2:22:03] <%hereiam407> Durian rule 34 surely exists
[2:22:03] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Yes there is some concept art you can find it on Google
[2:22:05] <%X2Eliah> hope you like combat
[2:22:14] <%Solid_Stro> I mean, who can care more then fan artists? Kappa
[2:22:14] <Ekaelis> Time to shoot more Cerberus
[2:22:19] <Sp3ctre48> They probably look similar to Halo Elites under their armor, which is kinda dull
[2:22:25] <%jillyrancher> it was in the special edition art book for ME1
[2:22:29] <%alphonseisbest> @jillyrancher good good Concept Tussy
[2:22:32] <@Ranryu692> did you give her the minigun?
[2:22:34] <goodcraz> theyre just shaped like their armour
[2:22:38] <goodcraz> in the artbook
[2:22:40] <SirDicksalotII> There’s plenty of fanart about how they look… Kappa
[2:22:42] <@Spydurman> Turian military might = super melter gun
[2:22:42] <Vekek_> Alien metal space birds just shoot good.
[2:22:51] <%xcompleasedad> Man, the Turians have HUGE boners for human LMG's, huh?
[2:22:57] <%jillyrancher> Femshep knows what a Turian without armor looks like
[2:22:57] <%demiiluna> I googled "Mass effect turian concept art" and I got art of male and female turians under their armor
[2:22:57] <@Ranryu692> those shield pylons restore your shields, too, in case you didn't know
[2:23:00] <KeystoneA2> Imagine how confusing it must be for Turians who get kissed by Humans/Asari
[2:23:01] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[2:23:12] <%hereiam407> How about the seekers from advent rising?
[2:23:15] <cpt_langosta> Y'all crazy about rishathra...
[2:23:22] <%Solid_Stro> Do Turians have projectile penises like ducks?
[2:23:26] <mattynezz> Those are Alliance vehicles, for no reason
[2:23:35] <olm46> Best shot in the galaxy
[2:23:37] <Gruhunchously> Oh hey they turned the lights off.
[2:23:45] <DSD24> I like your flash light
[2:23:50] <%hereiam407> Flashlight time
[2:23:58] <goodcraz> who turned out da lights
[2:24:06] <DSD24> No batteries for this Flashlight!
[2:24:08] <%ComfortableStranger> what a thrill...
[2:24:20] <jorniev> what is this re 4?
[2:24:20] <%hereiam407> Shake the controller when it goes out
[2:24:20] <%peachy996> lotta gameplay huh?
[2:24:25] <%peachy996> too much in fact
[2:24:27] <%Eldalu> Eldalu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hiya Pat! really enjoyed peach's ff14 stream yesterday! will you and peach do more spoopy games this October? ps, our son is now 7m old and still loves peach's elmo song 🙂
[2:24:33] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> This dlc is advance Shoots and ladders
[2:24:33] <PaperyHornet1013> THE BROKEN CUTSCENE IS COMING
[2:24:36] <DSD24> We are building the suspense
[2:24:37] <%Solid_Stro> It darkness and silence through the night…
[2:24:39] <%faintsmile> how much more until the dlc is over lol
[2:24:39] <@Spydurman> if necromorphs started crawling out this would be rad
[2:24:49] <Parapattern> With waist-high cover
[2:24:52] <%SWFanatic> oh yeah thermal sight i forgot
[2:24:52] <mattynezz> I mean....
[2:24:56] <%unhuggable1> told
[2:25:06] <%hereiam407> Dude, dead space/mass effect would not mesh well. But a cool nightmare DLC would work.
[2:25:07] <%peachy996> Don't let her get close to you
[2:25:12] <%SWFanatic> yay phantoms
[2:25:13] <KeystoneA2> Weeb thots destroyed
[2:25:14] <Gruhunchously> Is there literally any story content between now and the end
[2:25:18] <%peachy996> They will nothing personnel kid
[2:25:34] <%peachy996> ummmm
[2:25:34] <%andrewofbob> I'd like re remind chat that Pat is still yet to die to brute and phantom instant kills
[2:25:35] <%Solid_Stro> Oh look, waist high cover, this must be a shooty section
[2:25:40] <%jillyrancher> Hope ws can do Geth Dreadnought mission tonight too, it's much, much better than this
[2:25:52] <Sp3ctre48> @Gruhunchously I mean, yeah, it's not really good but there is
[2:25:54] <%ComfortableStranger> psaBlind
[2:25:58] <%peachy996> @andrewofbob Did he get hit by a Banshee?
[2:25:58] <%Daxalog> I swear to god if they appear behind- god damnit
[2:26:04] <%jillyrancher> God this DOES feel like an Andromeda mission.
[2:26:07] <%hereiam407> Yeesh
[2:26:11] <%peachy996> I missed that stream
[2:26:18] <@Spydurman> LUL
[2:26:25] <%hereiam407> Man, Pat sure is having a tough time with these guys
[2:26:25] <Sp3ctre48> I'm already excited to fight about the Geth again
[2:26:27] <@Spydurman> not even taking a step
[2:26:29] <%Daxalog> This is what Andromeda is like?
[2:26:33] <%X2Eliah> You know even the ME3 MP missions were more dynamic
[2:26:38] <%andrewofbob> @peachy996 Yeah, on the Ardakt-Yashi monastery
[2:26:38] <studleydoorite> door is bypassing itself
[2:26:38] <%ComfortableStranger> they are dropping down pat!
[2:26:39] <%Solid_Stro> I played and beat Andromeda and I can’t remember a single thing about it coxWat
[2:26:40] <ARDM112> One of her guys on the other side
[2:26:42] <cpt_langosta> distance bypassing to avoid COVID
[2:26:42] <SneakyCorpse> AI, duh
[2:26:48] <%peachy996> nice
[2:26:48] <%Puhff> Da Engineer
[2:26:48] <%Tarage> Don't worry about it.
[2:26:48] <Ekaelis> I miss Tuchanka
[2:26:50] <%JonathLP> Engineer on the otherside
[2:26:51] <%X2Eliah> Nah, Andromeda has a LOT more fetch quests
[2:26:53] <%jillyrancher> This may take a moment. 7th gen hold out moment. fuck
[2:26:57] <Sp3ctre48> I'll be nice and say most of Andromeda's combat is better than this
[2:27:08] <%hereiam407> This is where the idea for Anthem came fro
[2:27:08] <%jillyrancher> It is
[2:27:10] <%faintsmile> no substance just combat
[2:27:18] <%Tarage> Big robot
[2:27:19] <+dd44dostivei> even aria sounds bored
[2:27:20] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Really feel like y'all are overreacting over this DLC but it is the internet so that tracks
[2:27:22] <%jillyrancher> Not very interesting combat
[2:27:29] <%peachy996> Andromeda at least tries to put some story in but....it's Andromeda lol
[2:27:30] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I don't like Andromeda's gameplay to be honest
[2:27:45] <SaltyAzteca> See ya at the party Richter!
[2:27:51] <%hereiam407> Corridor after corridor
[2:27:53] <studleydoorite> @SaphronBlackbourne how DARE you jermaMoon
[2:27:53] <Sp3ctre48> I don't like it compared to ME3's but it's not terrible
[2:27:55] <%jillyrancher> @saphronblackbourne I mean it's boring to watch and kinda boring to play.
[2:27:57] <+dd44dostivei> bioware montreal
[2:27:58] <%SpcOpsBear> Omega is the weakest DLC, bar none.
[2:27:58] <%alphonseisbest> Andromeda SUCKS
[2:27:59] <%X2Eliah> its just too much combat
[2:28:01] <MaritimeSpanker> you know, I've been wondeirng this
[2:28:02] <%X2Eliah> too often
[2:28:07] <%JamesCorck> Third.
[2:28:08] <%faintsmile> its just blandddd. not the worst but bland
[2:28:09] <%AmericanSkidd> this one is probably the weakest
[2:28:10] <%JamesCorck> Third DLC.
[2:28:11] <DatAsuna> it was the second
[2:28:11] <@Ranryu692> I think Leviathan was first
[2:28:11] <Virokwet> maybe
[2:28:13] <%walternatorz> I think Leviathin was first
[2:28:13] <%X2Eliah> naw
[2:28:15] <%JH1224> Same. But hey, War Assets
[2:28:15] <MaritimeSpanker> why is the audio mixing in every part of this game making people have echoy voices?
[2:28:16] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan is so much better
[2:28:16] <%andrewofbob> ME3 doesn't have much of a difficulty curve beyond "just throw more enemies in"
[2:28:16] <Sp3ctre48> Leviathan was first I think
[2:28:17] <tattleworm> second after levi
[2:28:18] <cpt_langosta> wasn't javik first?
[2:28:19] <%unhuggable1> its a boring DLC
[2:28:19] <%X2Eliah> Javik was tne first xD
[2:28:20] <mattynezz> Aria sucks, Omega kind of sucks, and Andromeda sucks
[2:28:20] <%AmericanSkidd> 2nd
[2:28:23] <%jillyrancher> No
[2:28:23] <%JamesCorck> Javik was first.
[2:28:23] <DatAsuna> well third if you count extended cut but that was free
[2:28:25] <PaperyHornet1013> this is the big combat one
[2:28:25] <ARDM112> Leviathan's combat sections are even worse, but shorter
[2:28:26] <%unhuggable1> lots of combat and XP tho
[2:28:27] <%JamesCorck> Leviathan was second.
[2:28:27] <@Ranryu692> are we counting Javik as first?
[2:28:27] <%Puhff> Characters are cool, gameplay is boring af
[2:28:27] <%RealThiele> paste
[2:28:28] <@Spydurman> this feels like padding the hour count
[2:28:28] <%alphonseisbest> 2nd
[2:28:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Leviathan was first which is 'pretty good'
[2:28:30] <%jillyrancher> it was the 2nd Pat
[2:28:31] <mattynezz> Second, but this was cut content
[2:28:31] <%Tarage> Wait it can't be third.
[2:28:33] <%AmericanSkidd> javik doesnt count
[2:28:33] <@Ranryu692> Leviathan was the first post-launch DLC
[2:28:34] <count_bob> Andromeda is great.
[2:28:36] <tanarath> Javik, Leviathan, then this.
[2:28:43] <jorniev> OMEGA KINDA LOOKS LIKE A SHITHOLE
[2:28:45] <PaperyHornet1013> BROKEN CUTSCENE
[2:28:46] <Virokwet> only big thing i remember bout this dlc was female turian hype
[2:28:48] <%hereiam407> This place even looks boring
[2:28:49] <%ComfortableStranger> di Pat do levianthan yett?
[2:28:50] <MaritimeSpanker> the fact that Javik was on-disc and meant to be included from the get go, then turned into day one DLC is tragic
[2:28:50] <%peachy996> C''mon Aria Bug out
[2:28:51] <jorniev> LIKE A LAME SHITHOLE
[2:28:56] <DSD24> New enemies!
[2:29:00] <%peachy996> Bug out like the Xbox version
[2:29:01] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan is pretty great, Omega ehhhhh,
[2:29:02] <28moogles> It's just a boring DLC. There's a reason we keep mentioning this was made by the Andromeda team. lol
[2:29:06] <cpt_langosta> late-introduction zombies?
[2:29:08] <DatAsuna> javik was day 1 so he doesn't count, that's just content sliced out
[2:29:08] <%jillyrancher> Citadel Incredible
[2:29:09] <%hereiam407> Necromorphs?
[2:29:09] <%Daxalog> Gene Stealers!
[2:29:10] <%AmuserName> THEY PUNCH YOUR DNA LUL
[2:29:14] <jorniev> PLZ GET BUG EYES
[2:29:16] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Looks mtal
[2:29:16] <%MidnightBurst12> eww
[2:29:18] <%Dakuu75> hah
[2:29:20] <+beansoup> I liked this DLC and i liked Andromeda
[2:29:21] <mattynezz> Not what "eviscerate" means
[2:29:24] <jorniev> YEAAAH
[2:29:26] <%jillyrancher> I fought them before thieranightmare
[2:29:30] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Join the club
[2:29:32] <%hereiam407> Nice suit
[2:29:33] <%TheHateFish> SPECIAL EYES SEE ZOMBIE PLAGUE
[2:29:34] <%AmericanSkidd> it should be cooler than it is
[2:29:35] <stormhawk9891> Adjutants are cool at least
[2:29:35] <%jillyrancher> Adjutants are cool
[2:29:39] <%Dakuu75> yeah
[2:29:43] <%Tarage> DNA has arms.
[2:29:51] <mr_saturday93> no shut up
[2:29:53] <%hereiam407> Rips the chains apart
[2:29:54] <%Dakuu75> You can if you believe hard enough
[2:29:55] <blue8moon> dna has bowels Kappa
[2:29:56] <metalsiren31> Watch me
[2:29:56] <olm46> My DNA's bowels! Noooo!
[2:29:57] <%Tarage> Stop being racist against DNA
[2:29:58] <%Puhff> Lady, we've all killed monster-friends; you're not special.
[2:29:58] <%SWFanatic> you can't hug with nuclear arms
[2:30:00] <%walternatorz> pretend the dna strands are intestines
[2:30:00] <+GuilKato> well;  you can denature the DNA
[2:30:01] <Sp3ctre48> I completely forgot this was a thing
[2:30:03] <bear_breaker20> writers are smart shhh
[2:30:03] <%lumporr> dna just ain't got no bowels
[2:30:04] <studleydoorite> sure you can, you just won't get anything but a puddle of bio goop out of it
[2:30:04] <%X2Eliah> The cutscenes in this dlc feel very "Michael Bay" esque
[2:30:05] <jorniev> WAIT
[2:30:07] <intestinal_bleeding> data PAT
[2:30:09] <+Qexec> It decimates your DNA.
[2:30:12] <Srthunda> you wanna bet?
[2:30:15] <jumpyhugs> "e-" to remove. "viscera" guts.
[2:30:15] <Profmcstevie> "deprive (something) of its essential content" I guess
[2:30:16] <%Dakuu75> evisceration and vivisection are some of my favorite words
[2:30:16] <+beansoup> It's a word like decimate that lost it's true meaning decades ago.
[2:30:17] <MaritimeSpanker> WHAT
[2:30:20] <%peachy996> C'mon Aria do your thing!
[2:30:21] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt it also means "to deprive (something) of its essential content"
[2:30:23] <%AllenDeadman> DNA are chains and you can rip chains apart I guess?
[2:30:25] <%faintsmile> ugh
[2:30:26] <%Saffry_Ruzin> You can if you're Reaper tech apparently
[2:30:27] <%TheHateFish> It defenstrates your DNA
[2:30:28] <%hereiam407> This looks like the prison in Face/Off
[2:30:30] <%jillyrancher> Please dont make this the only mission this stream Pat
[2:30:30] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> They take your station Aria!
[2:30:32] <28moogles> @beansoup I mean, that's cool, but it also tracks. I find them both boring.
[2:30:34] <%peachy996> GLitch out
[2:30:34] <zhenthrim213> can we pls shoot her
[2:30:35] <MaritimeSpanker> ARIA, YOU'VE FAILED EVERY ASPECT SO FAR AND NEEDED A LOOOOT OF HELP WITH EVERYTHING
[2:30:37] <%jillyrancher> GOD SHUT UP ARIA.
[2:30:38] <%faintsmile> did aria get dumber in this dlc or was she always dumb
[2:30:39] <%Tarage> Aria feels like she needs to get laid super badly.
[2:30:41] <godila2> pat item on left side you need for side quest
[2:30:43] <@Ranryu692> so it was actually correct, just an obscure usage
[2:30:45] <DSD24> My eyes
[2:30:49] <%jillyrancher> shut the fuck up Aria
[2:30:49] <Profmcstevie> ARIA YOU'RE THE WORST PART OF THIS
[2:30:50] <%Tarage> Like christ she seems horny angry.
[2:30:51] <%Dakuu75> Listen to my eyes, everyone~
[2:30:51] <%Garthunox> Pat words can have multiple meanings
[2:30:52] <Sp3ctre48> Aria needs to cause conflict
[2:30:53] <%Puhff> stfu aria
[2:30:54] <Parapattern> Can't you SEE that?
[2:30:56] <%unhuggable1> lmao
[2:30:56] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> This DLC makes aria look spoilt
[2:30:58] <intestinal_bleeding> @PatStaresAt how so?
[2:31:02] <%peachy996> C'mon
[2:31:03] <PaperyHornet1013> BROKEN CUTSCENE!
[2:31:05] <%hereiam407> Everyone seems bored of what they are doing
[2:31:06] <Gruhunchously> Aria is one of those characters who can only get more lame the more we know about her

[2:31:36] <%peachy996> No
[2:31:36] <28moogles> It feels soulless. I get that feeling both from this and Andromeda.
[2:31:36] <%hereiam407> ACT, please try and ACT
[2:31:39] <%peachy996> NO
[2:31:39] <cpt_langosta> Aria is posting cringe...

[2:32:05] <28moogles> No matter what your issues with the ME3 ending, it doesn't feel soulless. The Andromeda team's stuff does.
[2:32:05] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Aria acting is cringe in this DLC.
[2:32:05] <DSD24> Fingerguns is great though Pat
[2:32:06] <%unhuggable1> @unhuggable1 its a longer kiss
[2:32:07] <@Spydurman> "Take Omega back for me!"
[2:32:09] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @datasuna It'd be fine if they didn't make her seem so stupid (after all the build up she got in 2)
[2:32:10] <%peachy996> Someone needs to send Pat the Speech bug STILL in the original version
[2:32:11] <%moonmintparadise> STRIKE AGAINST OPRESSORS ? YOU ADMITED TO RULING OMEGA WITH AN IRON FIST

[2:32:25] <%X2Eliah> @Dova573 it was so cool for the 1st and 2nd time. Really not by the 20th
[2:32:26] <%Puhff> this feels like book writing :(

[2:34:22] <PaperyHornet1013> put it on narrative and blow through the dlc
[2:34:22] <MaritimeSpanker> Its true what they say
[2:34:23] <DatAsuna> mmm, budget
[2:34:23] <%stantheman_97> you used biotic powers to mass effect it
[2:34:26] <%Dakuu75> yeah, this is feeling sketch
[2:34:27] <MaritimeSpanker> and as I recall
[2:34:28] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Thanks, andromeda
[2:34:38] <%ComfortableStranger> oh hey mark
[2:34:40] <MaritimeSpanker> Post-tuchanka, the game starts to get wonkier
[2:34:44] <%hereiam407> Another corridor, cool
[2:34:59] <%jillyrancher> I'd be more forgiving if this DLC didnt overstay its welcome so hard
[2:35:03] <@Ranryu692> I love that malletspace is a thing. thank you Rumiko Takahashi
[2:35:04] <Gruhunchously> They don't seem to be
[2:35:05] <%xcompleasedad> I cannot WAIT for the Geth
[2:35:05] <%FunkyStreams> right up mainstreet
[2:35:08] <+MoroseLoki> Ha that was dope
[2:35:09] <%ComfortableStranger> good times are being had
[2:35:10] <+beansoup> i mean, this is just like the rest of ME3 lol
[2:35:13] <%faintsmile> are we getting closer to the end
[2:35:13] <%jillyrancher> We arent even halfway done.
[2:35:24] <jorniev> SHPARD IS LIKE " ITS A LOT MORE FUN FROM MY END I PROMISE"
[2:35:26] <%faintsmile> @jillyrancher pls say syke
[2:35:29] <%hereiam407> They phasing in from space
[2:35:35] <%lumporr> seeing shepard joyfully stroll around a battlefield teleporting around must be terrifying
[2:35:40] <%andrewofbob> This is crazy; now the walls are racist
[2:35:40] <%hereiam407> He's good
[2:35:41] <%Tarage> "I cheated and now the game is too easy!"
[2:35:47] <Gruhunchously> I feel like a common theme in Bioware games is that there's WAY too much combat
[2:35:49] <mattynezz> OH NO, he is super bugged
[2:35:50] <%jillyrancher> it's like another hour or hour and a half
[2:35:50] <BrOOnoh> this dlc is also very long
[2:35:50] <+MoroseLoki> I read Geth and thought Gimps named Seth.... PowerUpL nagGasm PowerUpR
[2:35:51] <cpt_langosta> sit down like quigon
[2:35:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Combine drop pods LUL
[2:35:57] <28moogles> great design
[2:36:01] <PaperyHornet1013> no puppy guarding
[2:36:06] <%stantheman_97> he was nervous
[2:36:08] <Sp3ctre48> I like parts of ME3 enough to say this is not really what most of the game is like
[2:36:17] <%hereiam407> What is a rampant mech?
[2:36:23] <%hereiam407> Wait
[2:36:31] <jorniev> HAS pat used the big melee at all?
[2:36:33] <@Ranryu692> Pat have you seen that there's a KonoSuba gacha now?
[2:36:35] <BurdRightsActivist> @hereiam407 "Tougher"
[2:36:37] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> At least this is a good contrast to the actual good DLC
[2:36:41] <PaperyHornet1013> turret
[2:36:44] <Gruhunchously> YOu know what's great? Wave based defense missions where the enemies just nonchalantly trickle in
[2:36:48] <%andrewofbob> Why do they address him as "Commander" if they're not official military?
[2:36:48] <studleydoorite> it says Rampart Mech
[2:36:53] <MaritimeSpanker> @hereiam407 Isn't it "Rampart"?
[2:36:53] <%andrewofbob> Is it his first name
[2:36:55] <+MoroseLoki> Why who brought up KonoSuba?
[2:36:58] <mattynezz> Turret tho
[2:37:01] <bear_breaker20> howd it fall throughn the cieling?
[2:37:11] <jorniev> shoot the pilo
[2:37:17] <triangularblasphemy> Yeah thats autocannon fire for you
[2:37:18] <dekkitout> There are things about Mass Effect I'm surprised I haven't heard about- I'm not surprised to have not hear about this
[2:37:19] <BurdRightsActivist> UNGA
[2:37:25] <+MoroseLoki> Are you a Psychic? @ranryu692
[2:37:26] <cpt_langosta> was it a bacon-crusted roll?
[2:37:28] <%jillyrancher> God it's been the same combat loop for like an hour XD
[2:37:33] <%hereiam407> @MaritimeSpanker Yep, I messed up
[2:37:33] <triangularblasphemy> Turns out anti vehicle weaponry does okay against people
[2:37:34] <%Solid_Stro> doodDed
[2:37:35] <%Tarage> You don't sound like you're having fun Pat.
[2:37:37] <%jillyrancher> combat music loop
[2:37:39] <%RealThiele> roll deez nuts
[2:37:48] <Sp3ctre48> @andrewofbob Even criminals can be professional geez Keepo
[2:37:49] <BrOOnoh> the thing is this dlc is meant to be play months after you finished the game.
[2:37:50] <Gruhunchously> The only part of this DLC anyone remembers is the lady turian
[2:37:51] <%jillyrancher> The music in this DLC sucks ass
[2:37:55] <@Ranryu692> @MoroseLoki Pat said "Yes, I am Patrick" which is a KonoSuba reference ("hai, Kazuma desu)
[2:37:56] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> That doesnt make sense, humans arent vehicles
[2:37:58] <MaritimeSpanker> @hereiam407 dun worry, happens to all of us
[2:37:59] <%Saffry_Ruzin> There's a turret up there you csn use
[2:38:04] <%faintsmile> at least if the environment was cool it'd be one thing... this is all just the same looking
[2:38:07] <Gruhunchously> @jillyrancher It's shockingly mediocre
[2:38:08] <%Conscript_Gary> @andrewofbob Turians have a boner for military structure is my guess
[2:38:08] <%hereiam407> I'm getting Aliens Colonial Marines flashbacks for some reason
[2:38:27] <jorniev> cant you pilot those things in this game?
[2:38:29] <BurdRightsActivist> What was that transition? LUL
[2:38:30] <%Solid_Stro> This dlc is putting me to sleep, holy shit c4sageLUL
[2:38:34] <+dd44dostivei> this cost $15
[2:38:37] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Dont judge the DLC quality by Omega please, Leviathan and Citadel are miles better than this.
[2:38:42] <Gruhunchously> WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP?
[2:38:47] <dekkitout> Wha- nooo...
[2:38:49] <Latija> now kiss
[2:38:50] <%peachy996> That's an odd moment
[2:38:51] <triangularblasphemy> Citadel is quite good
[2:38:54] <+trackles_64> No sounds during dialouge
[2:38:55] <%Dakuu75> isn't this place in space? and everyone is using explosions and grenades and shit
[2:38:56] <%jillyrancher> Shut the fuck up Aria
[2:38:59] <%hereiam407> Yeh
[2:38:59] <@Ranryu692> @dd44dostivei Flare is almost worth it

[2:39:18] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> She looks like grievous
[2:39:18] <@QueequegTheater> CRIMINAL ELCOR PogChamp
[2:39:19] <DatAsuna> similarly Vetra is one of the few good things in andromeda
[2:39:19] <%Tarage> BADASSFULLY
[2:39:20] <Parapattern> Too bad that didn't transfer to Andromeda
[2:39:20] <SaltyAzteca> The eyes are so random lol
[2:39:21] <%Conscript_Gary> ELCOR!
[2:39:21] <ARDM112> What Pat secretly always wanted was just Garrus in a dress
[2:39:22] <%Puhff> The Andromeda Fem Turian is cool too but not AS cool

[2:39:29] <%X2Eliah> Kiss the Elcor!

[2:39:37] <%Scevda> Shes hot
[2:39:41] <triangularblasphemy> "She did not"
[2:39:43] <%zanz_san> I hope Aria dies in this
[2:39:47] <MaritimeSpanker> OH
[2:39:54] <%peachy996> I think I like Vetra more simply because you spend more time with her than you ever did with Nyreen
[2:39:56] <Sp3ctre48> Too bad Vetra is super boring in Andromeda
[2:39:59] <%Tarage> BADASSFULLY I WISH TO HAVE GUNS STRAPPED TO MY BACK
[2:40:01] <%RealThiele> *Lies Criminally* :you did it

[2:45:04] <%AmuserName> BRAIN EMPTY, OMEGA-MALE.
[2:45:05] <%alphonseisbest> 2/3
[2:45:06] <@Ranryu692> I remember this being the halfway point, but I was stoned and tired so who knows
[2:45:10] <%Tarage> We're good at this.

[2:45:26] <+ScrapKingKeita> so we're doing omega dlc for today?
[2:45:31] <%andrewofbob> We might actually be exactly halfway in
[2:45:31] <+JustToWatch> somewhere between 25-80%
[2:45:33] <%Daxalog> Gotta turn off the reactors
[2:45:38] <Sp3ctre48> Probably
[2:45:39] <%jillyrancher> Quality from Montreal lol
[2:45:40] <SneakyCorpse> we are here to suffer with you, Pat
[2:45:41] <+trackles_64> this part a bitch on insanity

[2:46:08] <James_Quivers> Big fuckup Bray
[2:46:08] <%Tarage> Bray isn't paid enough for this bullshit.
[2:46:10] <+trackles_64> Hes a batarian he should be
[2:46:14] <%peachy996> Bray is in it for the Pa
[2:46:14] <PaperyHornet1013> bray your fucking incompetent

[2:46:57] <James_Quivers> BANG HER
[2:47:02] <Insidious_Vision> what the hell happened to shepard
[2:47:10] <%DEETRz> sex the cool alien
[2:47:17] <%X2Eliah> @stantheman_97 actually yes
[2:47:20] <Insidious_Vision> man he got old since me3 came out
[2:47:37] <Gruhunchously> You'd better be able to bang Aria at the end of this. Only thing that will make this worth it
[2:47:38] <%Solid_Stro> “Let’s go to my bird’s nest”
[2:47:42] <%faintsmile> ??? is there a decision shepard can make or is this just fluff dialogue
[2:47:48] <+MoroseLoki> Shepard went to war kinda reminds me of The Sam Fisher Voice Actoor
[2:47:49] <%lord_woodsy> is it bad that I'm on here so I can be here live on my phone but I'm catching up on the archives on my TV? I'm only a couple streams behind now and I'll be watching live with you guys!
[2:47:52] <BurdRightsActivist> ???
[2:48:03] <%peachy996> Respect him please
[2:48:11] <Ekaelis> Nyreen is cool, but painfully single minded here
[2:48:12] <olaksi> he plays chess so smort
[2:48:13] <BurdRightsActivist> PLEASE THINK HE'S COOL
[2:48:13] <%X2Eliah> The writing in this dlc is very "tell, dont show"
[2:48:14] <+MoroseLoki> the look not the voice
[2:48:16] <%peachy996> Look at how cool his chess pieces are
[2:48:21] <+trackles_64> kissy
[2:48:25] <Sp3ctre48> Very honorable racist
[2:48:29] <%peachy996> Petrovsky is a lesser pushed Kai Leng
[2:48:34] <olaksi> why is bioware so bad at writing villains
[2:48:35] <%Solid_Stro> He plays… Chess doodStare
[2:48:37] <Gruhunchously> Oh my god this is Andromeda
[2:48:38] <godila2> @faintsmile there is small one, but it wont matter for main game
[2:48:51] <oz19999> Man she loves people, huh?
[2:48:52] <%faintsmile> ahh ok
[2:48:55] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> Holy textures Batman
[2:48:57] <+trackles_64> Bluusy
[2:49:01] <%SWFanatic> literally
[2:49:02] <+dd44dostivei> morinth?
[2:49:04] <%moonmintparadise> why does she have eyeliner ?
[2:49:06] <dekkitout> Phrasing
[2:49:07] <SaltyAzteca> I bet a lot was rubbed off on ya, ah?
[2:49:08] <cpt_langosta> how much rubbing off did you and aria do?
[2:49:11] <$hattrick61> I wanted her to rub off on me
[2:49:13] <%JH1224> da big sploosh
[2:49:13] <%unhuggable1> they did butt to butt
[2:49:17] <lyzejag> She gay
[2:49:23] <+trackles_64> Seems like a toxic realation ship
[2:49:24] <%Solid_Stro> They scissored once Kappa
[2:49:30] <Gruhunchously> It's not gay if it's asari
[2:49:32] <%tamale_senpai> Pat you got some of that Blue and Purple shit, now how about that Plate shit though?
[2:49:33] <%andrewofbob> Lore point: turians are untrusting of biotics, and ship them off into their own groups, a less racist discrimination, if you will
[2:49:34] <Sp3ctre48> @olaksi They spent all their good antagonist writing on Loghain
[2:49:36] <fetelgeuse> Is it really gay if it's asari ass?
[2:49:41] <cpt_langosta> REMEMBER... who you are... this is CNN... C... N... N...
[2:49:41] <%stantheman_97> someone got rubbed off
[2:49:47] <olm46> Could use some skin cream
[2:49:54] <+trackles_64> They might be soft
[2:49:57] <James_Quivers> They're for gripping
[2:50:03] <%Estuko> I want to be her wife, will that kill me
[2:50:08] <%Scevda> Ruined!
[2:50:14] <%AmuserName> Collector-barriers! PogChamp
[2:50:15] <Who_lio42> i mean you ever seen bird flesh? shits bad
[2:50:16] <jorniev> GOOD THING GARRUS DIDNT SHOW UP FOR THIS MISSION
[2:50:16] <%Scevda> Wait garrus has them too
[2:50:33] <%SpoonheadInExile> Immersion broken. Bald people can't be heroes.
[2:50:34] <ARDM112> And the reasons turians dislike biotic users is that some centuries back biotics were placed in their military units incognito as secret police, Psi Corps-style
[2:50:40] <%faintsmile> @Estuko is there a nobler cause than dying for the tussy
[2:50:46] <+trackles_64> lol loading screens
[2:51:09] <%peachy996> Big Man open dooors
[2:51:10] <%Tarage> SKE-MAT-IKS
[2:51:17] <%Estuko> @Estuko Answered my own question when I stared at her a second longer
[2:51:18] <%SpoonheadInExile> Actually I just remembered Picard. NVM
[2:51:22] <+trackles_64> i hate this part
[2:51:24] <HyperionXV> To shreds you say?
[2:51:33] <%coward_man> hey look, a Dead Space
[2:51:35] <+Megastructure> I thought she had the OU symbol on her jacket
[2:51:36] <Gruhunchously> oh hey atmosphere
[2:51:44] <%Tarage> @PlainSimpleTailor TNG Picard or horrible new TV show Picard?
[2:51:44] <James_Quivers> Seeing the actual asteroid parts of Omega is a neat addition to theh DLC
[2:51:48] <%X2Eliah> every time
[2:51:51] <%peachy996> Behold the only vaguely interesting bit of this dlc
[2:51:52] <%jillyrancher> This part is ok
[2:51:55] <%thekris26> this part can be kind of confusing.
[2:52:04] <%peachy996> Is this mine section
[2:52:05] <TheAntiNihilist> ResidentSleeper
[2:52:06] <%Garthunox> ""Survival" "Horror""
[2:52:08] <HyperionXV> You'd think they'd have some of those mega flashlights in the future
[2:52:13] <%Solid_Stro> They written something on the wall in blood that says “dismember Them” Kappa
[2:52:16] <+trackles_64> shhh
[2:52:20] <notsoy> attacked by a bioHAZARD, maybe Kappa
[2:52:22] <studleydoorite> they fucked that one crate up for some reason

[2:52:38] <+trackles_64> yeah a single one
[2:52:41] <MaritimeSpanker> meat tech that turnbs people in meat tech
[2:52:42] <ARDM112> @PatStaresAt Single one can make more
[2:52:46] <studleydoorite> shouldn't all those dead people be monsters then?
[2:52:47] <%JamesCorck> this isn't Alien isolation, Pat.
[2:52:50] <%JamesCorck> Don't worry.
[2:52:51] <Dommykins> a real xenomorph motherfucker
[2:52:57] <%SWFanatic> STARSSSS

[2:58:24] <DatAsuna> aria is very edgey
[2:58:24] <%peachy996> Thing is they don't look like they come from an species
[2:58:25] <@Spydurman> can we just like skip this whole thing? LUL
[2:58:25] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Intimidating
[2:58:26] <+Goraka91> They're super cool though! Cooler than Kai!
[2:58:26] <TG_Cid11> A whole squad couldn't kill that
[2:58:30] <%jillyrancher> WHOLE SQUAD OF SOLDIERS PAT @patstaresat
[2:58:30] <%faintsmile> E d g y
[2:58:30] <%hereiam407> Omg, they're all Aliens
[2:58:43] <%SWFanatic> This enemy is so dangerous, I don't know how we can possibly defeat it.
[2:58:44] <%jillyrancher> WHOLE SQUAD OF SQUADRONS
[2:58:52] <SaltyAzteca> Well that sucked
[2:58:53] <DatAsuna> That team was good at multiplayer and nothing else
[2:58:55] <%coward_man> remember this DLC let gave them the green light to lead a full ME game
[2:58:55] <%Daxalog> Was it woolie?
[2:58:57] <RockinLockin> It really shows, unfortunately
[2:59:00] <%SpcOpsBear> Are you actually shitting on your acquaintance?
[2:59:03] <%peachy996> Was it the White Tears guy
[2:59:06] <%Tarage> This is more interesting than the DLC
[2:59:06] <%SpcOpsBear> Or just their company at the time?
[2:59:08] <tanarath> Bioware magic
[2:59:10] <%Estuko> I ... Lost any form of curiosity and fear whn it whipped out a gun and got put down in 5 seconds. :(
[2:59:11] <%peachy996> Cuz that guy was a chode
[2:59:13] <%Scevda> Also engine switch
[2:59:15] <zhenthrim213> @jillyrancher an ARMY OF SQUADRONS
[2:59:15] <%hereiam407> Same as Anthem?
[2:59:17] <mattynezz> LUL
[2:59:20] <DatAsuna> EA offered them ANOTHER delay
[2:59:21] <%JamesCorck> Bioware Magic, indeed x.x
[2:59:21] <%jillyrancher> It's funny and kinda sad
[2:59:25] <%peachy996> Engine switch
[2:59:25] <Coystick> Fuck EA anyway
[2:59:31] <%maenos2> anthem showed Bioware sucks
[2:59:33] <Gruhunchously> Didn't the same thing happen with Anthem?
[2:59:34] <@Spydurman> Frostbite engine SUCKS ASS
[2:59:34] <%kettleroot> Bioware really fucke up on andromeda and Anthem
[2:59:37] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> "Well, the DLC you guys made sucked. So you should probably make the entire next game."
[2:59:37] <Chester_goes_Berserk> OOF
[2:59:39] <%AmericanSkidd> fuck em all
[2:59:39] <%peachy996> Why the fuck would you suddenly switch to Frostbite
[2:59:41] <%cvp5127> still gonna blame ea
[2:59:43] <mattynezz> EA did force them to use Frostbite, didn't they?
[2:59:44] <jorniev> wow
[2:59:46] <%jillyrancher> Bioware fucked it up hard with Andromeda
[2:59:46] <%hereiam407> What was the engine before Frostbite? Unreal?
[2:59:47] <@QueequegTheater> EA literally OFFERED THEM ANOTHER YEAR AND THEY SAID NO
[2:59:52] <RockinLockin> jesus
[2:59:54] <Marpolo13> na we'll just blame EA anyway
[2:59:55] <%maenos2> @hereiam407 yes
[3:00:02] <Coystick> Frostbite is cursed
[3:00:02] <@Spydurman> @mattynezz no they chose to do it to save money
[3:00:03] <%Treasure_Vault> Twitter thread from a month ago popped up about how Sonic Colors was gonna be a shitshow cause of SEGA seemed pretty convincing.
[3:00:03] <Virokwet> bioware was suckin rocks before anthem came out
[3:00:04] <DatAsuna> @hereiam407 Ue3
[3:00:07] <tanarath> B I O W A R E M A G I C
[3:00:08] <RockinLockin> they really fucked themselves over
[3:00:09] <%mongorific> mongorific subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[3:00:09] <%Treasure_Vault> But also, I know nothing about Sonic.
[3:00:10] <Jmann1892> WOW That's deadly
[3:00:13] <%Scevda> An engine that handled the same cutscenes worse
[3:00:15] <Gruhunchously> A whole squad of soldiers couldn't take this thing out
[3:00:17] <mattynezz> SQUAD
[3:00:19] <Sp3ctre48> I will never forgive Frostbite for all the damage it's done to this series
[3:00:21] <%SpoonheadInExile> Wow. That's stupid
[3:00:21] <+trackles_64> BIOWARE MAGIC
[3:00:22] <%andrewofbob> @peachy996 Costs; I guess you wouldn't have to pay for a licence to your publisher's engine
[3:00:22] <%JamesCorck> Pride.
[3:00:22] <%greasypete00> thats so stranger
[3:00:23] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> spite
[3:00:23] <%hereiam407> They didn't have much faith in their team
[3:00:23] <TheMostAverageGamer4> egos maybe?
[3:00:25] <%JamesCorck> Pride, man.
[3:00:26] <%peachy996> They really wanted to stop working on it
[3:00:27] <OldManDeckardCain> obsidian
[3:00:28] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I recall the article where the team just had no leadership and wouldn't agree on the direction until it was too late
[3:00:29] <%JamesCorck> It was all a matter of pride.
[3:00:29] <+orochiblood> isnt that what the GoT writers did
[3:00:31] <MaritimeSpanker> More time is ONLY good
[3:00:31] <+Goraka91> Bioware magic baby
[3:00:31] <%maenos2> THEY GAME OF THRONES IT?!
[3:00:33] <@Spydurman> Frostbite has ruined so many games
[3:00:34] <tattleworm> if they had extra time, the bioware magic would wear off
[3:00:35] <MaritimeSpanker> lets you fix shit
[3:00:35] <%cvp5127> we love crunch
[3:00:35] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Probably because of bonuses
[3:00:37] <%tyler274> gotta look good for that bonusssss
[3:00:38] <%hereiam407> They probably knew whatever they made was going to suck
[3:00:38] <%Solid_Stro> Frostbite is only good for graphics and shooting, not motion capture or facial recognition
[3:00:40] <Profmcstevie> EVERY CREATIVE WANTS MORE TIME
[3:00:41] <%stantheman_97> WHY WOULD YOU DENY MORE TIME
[3:00:46] <+Diz001> That "Bioware Magic" lol
[3:00:47] <DatAsuna> syanding in aoes lol
[3:00:47] <SeruraRenge> @PatStaresAt Imagine a Dragon Age 2 that got another year in the oven
[3:00:48] <%greasypete00> off
[3:00:48] <%Scevda> Another year would have saved it….
[3:00:48] <+BigChiefBear> There was probably a big IF in that tho
[3:00:50] <%SpcOpsBear> THEIRS
[3:00:50] <+CookieCutter007> the project leads sounded insane in that article
[3:00:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yay space action man time with Pat
[3:00:51] <%greasypete00> oof*
[3:00:52] <%Faultlined> Whole squad
[3:00:52] <SystemShut> thier
[3:00:53] <KeystoneA2> Adjutants
[3:00:53] <%cvp5127> yes
[3:00:54] <%X2Eliah> theirs
[3:00:54] <studleydoorite> DNA: eviscerated
[3:00:54] <Jmann1892> Their move
[3:00:55] <TG_Cid11> his
[3:00:55] <%walternatorz> their move it looks like
[3:00:56] <triangularblasphemy> It is theirs
[3:00:56] <%SWFanatic> you stood in a dot
[3:00:56] <Coystick> Yes
[3:00:57] <Javier9563> their move
[3:00:58] <%peachy996> What's the alien influence on this creature?
[3:00:58] <glimzemal> enemy move
[3:00:59] <Marpolo13> yes
[3:01:00] <+MightyDuckShoes> You are My Queen....Rachni
[3:01:00] <DatAsuna> their
[3:01:01] <Sp3ctre48> Their move lol
[3:01:03] <Srthunda> maybe they hated it and wanted to just be done
[3:01:07] <$sleepystardewfarmer> it's like when you want to hand in a paper when you know it stinks
[3:01:07] <%AmericanSkidd> remember the one persons resume that had experience, "very experienced"
[3:01:08] <ARDM112> Grandpa Pat needs his medication
[3:01:08] <BurdRightsActivist> DOTS, MORE DOTS
[3:01:08] <mattynezz> Theirs LUL
[3:01:08] <triangularblasphemy> @PatStaresAt AoE Biotic
[3:01:09] <%jillyrancher> it's a miracle Inquisition used Frostbite and made it functional lol
[3:01:10] <%walternatorz> looks like a warp field
[3:01:12] <%andrewofbob> Aria's flare looks like a straight biotic explosion
[3:01:12] <James_Quivers> It's a darker purple bruh, cmon Kappa
[3:01:18] <DatAsuna> pat is the DPS standing in circles
[3:01:18] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Oh sick he’s doing Omega
[3:01:18] <$sleepystardewfarmer> "get it out of my sight"
[3:01:31] <%Scevda> Good gun
[3:01:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:34] <Coystick> I like their design at least
[3:01:38] <Marpolo13> lmao
[3:01:40] <Sp3ctre48> oh noooo
[3:01:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> lol
[3:01:46] <%hereiam407> Bioware is on it's last chance, isn't it
[3:01:49] <zhenthrim213> AMAZING
[3:01:49] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Welp
[3:01:54] <%Solid_Stro> doodDerp
[3:01:54] <%SilverReamalus> Pat ytou are a super soldier.
[3:01:55] <James_Quivers> She was probably refering to Vorcha squads tho
[3:01:58] <%peachy996> They don't really follow a set Husk design though
[3:02:03] <intestinal_bleeding> infections give us goo guns, of course
[3:02:04] <TG_Cid11> to be fair Shepard is like a whole platoon of soldiers
[3:02:05] <%peachy996> Kind of annoying
[3:02:08] <ARDM112> It didn't shoot a gun, it was its biotic blast or whatever
[3:02:10] <mattynezz> They're area denial support units, they REALLY don't fit the plot
[3:02:11] <Marpolo13> @hereiam407 i'd have to assume so
[3:02:16] <James_Quivers> Cerberus has a funky rhythm
[3:02:19] <Gruhunchously> This dialogue is great
[3:02:26] <%Solid_Stro> I’m honestly surprised BioWare didn’t get liquidated after Anthem
[3:02:28] <MaritimeSpanker> They don't look like any aliens in the game tho
[3:02:28] <DatAsuna> Bioware edmonton has the OG studio armour on, but bioware Austin are the only ones making money
[3:02:29] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Spooped
[3:02:30] <SeruraRenge> Does ANYONE have faith in Dragon Age 4?
[3:02:34] <%walternatorz> that was a weird animation
[3:02:36] <bearwagon> LUL
[3:02:39] <triangularblasphemy> Sometimes we all feel mad
[3:02:39] <%Estuko> monkaS She's the real monster
[3:02:39] <James_Quivers> shotgun equip animation
[3:02:40] <studleydoorite> she's scared, pat
[3:02:40] <+Goraka91> Fuck no
[3:02:41] <%jillyrancher> They never actually turn anyone into Adjutants iirc
[3:02:42] <Ahk_90> also, these adjutants look and sound a lot like genestealers
[3:02:42] <+FoolsArcade> NO FAITH
[3:02:42] <Latija> no
[3:02:42] <Chaos_Aether> no
[3:02:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> @SeruraRenge no
[3:02:43] <triangularblasphemy> that is how Aria does it
[3:02:45] <Marpolo13> LUL
[3:02:45] <%JamesCorck> Nope.
[3:02:46] <%Treuan> no faith
[3:02:46] <%HairballCT> LUL
[3:02:46] <%X2Eliah> ohhh
[3:02:46] <Profmcstevie> She dances when stressed
[3:02:47] <%CatRidder> NO
[3:02:48] <RockinLockin> I'm scared.
[3:02:49] <@Ranryu692> faith no, hope yes
[3:02:49] <%faintsmile> no
[3:02:50] <%peachy996> There's a Frisbee Gun in this section
[3:02:50] <DatAsuna> Nope
[3:02:51] <%JamesCorck> Zero%
[3:02:52] <Virokwet> cautious hope
[3:02:52] <penitentpendant> Zero faith
[3:02:53] <+CookieCutter007> LUL that teaser was so awful
[3:02:53] <+geekjacob> no
[3:02:54] <Gruhunchously> ha ha ha ha ha
[3:02:56] <%jillyrancher> not really
[3:02:58] <mattynezz> lol no
[3:03:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> I have faith it'll generate a hilarious amount of questionable articles written about it
[3:03:02] <Srthunda> looked like she had a hissy fit
[3:03:02] <%hereiam407> @Marpolo13 I'm playing the Saboteur today, and it's hard to see so many companies die out
[3:03:04] <%Scevda> Hah no
[3:03:04] <%moonmintparadise> No, I saw Magic Neon Light signs and went "nope"
[3:03:06] <%jillyrancher> I hope itll be good but probably not.
[3:03:06] <%Solid_Stro> …
[3:03:07] <tattleworm> lol no
[3:03:07] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Ha
[3:03:07] <Virokwet> of thier last two games
[3:03:09] <%stantheman_97> i forgot that existed
[3:03:09] <godila2> maybe, but its like 2023 game
[3:03:09] <%cvp5127> ea is giving it infinite time
[3:03:10] <%X2Eliah> true
[3:03:10] <Profmcstevie> No one would be stupid TWICE right
[3:03:12] <SaltyAzteca> He said the thing
[3:03:12] <Sp3ctre48> I have a LITTLE faith in Dragon Age 4 since Tresspasser was good even if I didnt like Inquisition itself
[3:03:13] <%HairballCT> @SeruraRenge no bleedPurple
[3:03:15] <@Ranryu692> ALL of the polish
[3:03:15] <MaritimeSpanker> if it fails, end of company-fail?
[3:03:16] <ARDM112> That's why it's not coming out at all LUL
[3:03:18] <%peachy996> I think after this Mass Effect joins that name
[3:03:18] <Gruhunchously> But they'll do it anyway
[3:03:21] <+FingaLights> It will be Fine to middle at least
[3:03:22] <mr_saturday93> youknowwwhayimean
[3:03:22] <Marpolo13> @hereiam407 i hear ya
[3:03:24] <%Zebroneath> If they fuck up, Bioware is more than super dead
[3:03:26] <%Tarage> So it won't come out.
[3:03:29] <%CatRidder> its gonna be as good as inquisition
[3:03:29] <%jillyrancher> I like Inquisition even if it's super jank
[3:03:31] <tattleworm> in the time it took you to make that statement, they restarted development of dragon age 4 six times
[3:03:31] <%AkronymCLT> You are not allowed to risk the brand anymore
[3:03:32] <%AmericanSkidd> you say that...
[3:03:34] <Virokwet> they better try so hard to course correct
[3:03:36] <%JamesCorck> Unless it's Pokemon.
[3:03:36] <KeystoneA2> Except Pokemon
[3:03:38] <%SpoonheadInExile> I'd rather just have bioware collapse so I don't have to look at garbage running animations ever again :P jk
[3:03:39] <%moonmintparadise> A good 7/10 like Inquisition
[3:03:42] <%JamesCorck> Then it can come out being total garbage.
[3:03:43] <%Scevda> But will it be good?
[3:03:43] <penitentpendant> That Metroid restart
[3:03:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> Pokemon is allowed to be as bad as the company wants it to be
[3:03:44] <Profmcstevie> No you put Zelda BACK IN THE OVEN I'm not spitting that out
[3:03:45] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> It’ll get released like that
[3:03:45] <Geoblood> I have a feeling that if Dragon Age 4 fails bioware gets liquidated
[3:03:45] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Well neither was Anthem honestly but still
[3:03:46] <%FunkyStreams> a game being in development for ages is also not good, though.
[3:03:47] <%kettleroot> and some nintendo games arent allowed.... right mr falcon
[3:03:47] <%Solid_Stro> BioWare is on their last legs
[3:03:48] <digaogrunge> They will find a way to fuck it up
[3:03:49] <+trackles_64> Mobile games
[3:03:50] <%peachy996> Mass Effect 4 will not be allowed to be shit, Bioware will die first and the game will be made under EA wherever
[3:03:54] <$NoctisxMog> I also liked trespasser but I have 0 faith
[3:03:54] <mattynezz> Okay, but who has faith for the new Mass Effect sequel that is going to combine "The Mily Way and Andromeda Galaxy" LUL
[3:04:02] <@Ranryu692> I was just listening to an old podcast where you and Woolie talked about polish taking games from 6s to 9s
[3:04:06] <GustauveVIII> if they make DA4, holy shit just make it into an action game instead of a shitty unit-control game like DA2 or DA:I
[3:04:06] <RockinLockin> If Dragon Age 4 sucks it's goodnight Bioware, i'm just saying
[3:04:06] <SeruraRenge> I mean you say that but Blizzard has shown they're completely disconnected from what makes a good game anymore
[3:04:07] <%Scevda> Bold of pat to assume the people playing to give it a pass know a goddamn thing about quality.
[3:04:17] <%jillyrancher> That's it for Adjutants
[3:04:20] <TheLocalRival> Dragon age inquisition sucked hard
[3:04:21] <dekkitout> @SveriSageAdvice I assume they get a pass due to the mountains of money from merch
[3:04:22] <%FunkyStreams> Bioware isnt even bioware anymore so I reckon not.
[3:04:31] <%jillyrancher> they'll show up again in the last battle section.
[3:04:33] <DatAsuna> @mattynezz The galaxy that we only got to explore like 2% of anyway thanks to the dumb plot gas
[3:04:34] <+Goraka91> It's just disappointing what happened to Bioware Bethesda and Blizzard man
[3:04:38] <%hereiam407> @mattynezz Collision of galaxies? Or traveling between the two?
[3:04:45] <+dd44dostivei> colostomoney
[3:04:47] <%SpoonheadInExile> Good
[3:04:49] <intestinal_bleeding> longer development periods always indicates red flags
[3:04:49] <+trackles_64> i didnt buy anthem
[3:04:51] <%peachy996> I do
[3:04:54] <%DEETRz> anthem is one of my biggest heart breaks ever in gaming
[3:04:54] <willyfreshness> anybody else watching the stream and the music sounds like shit?
[3:04:55] <Virokwet> no one
[3:04:59] <amerika> i wonder if they even made their advertising budget back with Anthem
[3:04:59] <%peachy996> I get to laugh at their failures
[3:05:00] <mattynezz> @hereiam407 No clue, they just said they're going to tie them together
[3:05:00] <%RealThiele> colostemy
[3:05:02] <Coystick> I'm happy about anthem
[3:05:02] <%FunkyStreams> sad too because it looked really cool.
[3:05:03] <%warpath1911> flops like that kill companies
[3:05:04] <RockinLockin> why can't they just let studios do what they're good at
[3:05:05] <%peachy996> And at EA in general
[3:05:07] <intestinal_bleeding> like when a game seems to take longer than it should to finish, that's a bad sign
[3:05:07] <Gruhunchously> We only ever got to explore 1% of the Milky Way Galaxy
[3:05:07] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Doesnt mean they now know what makes a game good
[3:05:09] <godila2> it was literally made in last 2 year, because bioware was fucking around whole time NotLikeThis
[3:05:11] <@Spydurman> Anthem, Andromeda, Cyberpunk, Fallout 76. These nations use to live in hype, until the gamers attacked
[3:05:12] <@Ranryu692> I wish I had bought Anthem, in retrospect
[3:05:13] <+FingaLights> @Goraka91 the three B's Baby... Never can go wrong
[3:05:13] <%kettleroot> Anthem never looked good
[3:05:15] <DatAsuna> @hereiam407 unspecificied but one assume they'll make some kinda hyper relay tunnel
[3:05:15] <%stantheman_97> are they working on dragon age 4 and mass effect 4 now?
[3:05:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> @SveriSageAdvice i fully expect to find out Pokemon Company doesnt even crunch Game Freak at all, they're just poor at resource management
[3:05:20] <%hereiam407> @mattynezz Hah, please no
[3:05:24] <TheLocalRival> Bioware has really been given the short end of the stick with EA, imagine if they were owned by Playstation
[3:05:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The dlc should be alled shoots and ladders
[3:05:25] <@Ranryu692> just to experience the shit firsthand
[3:05:35] <+Goraka91> @RockinLockin Because you gotta make MORE every year, it's not enough to simply be profitable
[3:05:40] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah but "BioWare" as a name has some value attached to it
[3:05:41] <%Mattais88> Anthem looked good, until combat started
[3:05:48] <%Scevda> Right and the people who tried to make it right as devs are fired while the head honchos who okayed the failure are still there.
[3:05:52] <%Solid_Stro> The Bob Dylan of video games is what they thought Anthem was going to be Kappa
[3:05:52] <%SpcOpsBear> If Dragon Age 4 fails, you can say goodbye to Mass Effect 4 even being a thing.
[3:05:52] <%SpoonheadInExile> @SveriSageAdvice Yeah, I'll drink to that
[3:05:55] <%Garthunox> you mean like Visceral?
[3:05:59] <SeruraRenge> Game Freak is a wierd exception because they market towards there always being a new generation of kids, which is really a model that cant fail
[3:06:14] <%hereiam407> This level so boring, everyone is wondering when Bioware will die LUL
[3:06:15] <%andrewofbob> How do you like shooting right handed?
[3:06:16] <%kettleroot> @TheLocalRival hardly, look at the development of Anthem. Bioware fucked that up on their own. You know Anthem wouldnt have even had flight if it wasnt for an EA exec suggesting it
[3:06:17] <$NoctisxMog> I think bioware is done for after da4 good or not
[3:06:23] <godila2> @TheLocalRival no they werent , how in 4 years you have nothing good to show, but then ea is like what the fuck make something and do it in last 2
[3:06:31] <%SirGO0SE> All of this shit looks good on the surface because thats all that matter to them. They arent in the business of making good games, theyre in the business of getting you to part with money
[3:06:33] <+ScrapKingKeita> Anthem didn't meet its target sales, and the CFO for EA went out and said that the microtransactions were not anywhere enough to make money back
[3:06:38] <+Goraka91> Visceral gave us one of the best new IPs EA had and they just fucking gutted it man
[3:06:41] <%FunkyStreams> im guessing EA is putting most of its eggs in the Battlefield basket.
[3:06:45] <%hereiam407> Sounds familiar
[3:06:47] <+BossPlayerOG> How close to the end are we?
[3:06:49] <RockinLockin> Inquisition is super inconsistent
[3:06:51] <%peachy996> Whatever happens to Bioware, ME4 will be made.
[3:06:52] <DatAsuna> A lot like ME3 tbh
[3:06:54] <%AmericanSkidd> kinda like this
[3:06:54] <%Mattais88> I want a DA2 remake so badly
[3:06:56] <jorniev> LIKE THAT GREEN BAR
[3:06:59] <%Tarage> 2/3rds
[3:07:00] <%SWFanatic> witcher 3 > DAI
[3:07:00] <Ids560> I'd say a 7 is fair
[3:07:00] <%X2Eliah> myeah
[3:07:01] <%SpoonheadInExile> The running animations were typical of bioware, never felt natural
[3:07:03] <%JamesCorck> Pat you just channeled Mr. Plinket when you said "are fucking Naaaaaawt!!!"
[3:07:03] <DatAsuna> great when it's good and shit when it's bad
[3:07:09] <%Scevda> Just like ME 3
[3:07:09] <$FriedMattato> In short, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a game of contrasts
[3:07:14] <%jillyrancher> I can forgive a lot for Iron Bull
[3:07:17] <TheLocalRival> I feel most western RPGs need to relook their dialogue choices since Bioware and Bethesda ended up going back to Unga Bunga dialogue
[3:07:17] <mattynezz> Inquisition combat and encounter design is so bad I can't bring myself to ever give a shit
[3:07:19] <$FriedMattato> 2014 GOTY BAY BEE
[3:07:19] <knight_verse> Anthem failed so hard that they rebooted the new Dragons Age back onto a proper RPG.
[3:07:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> i think the only reason Pokemon Sword and Shield was so bad because they decided to make Town Hero, which never should have had priority whatsoever
[3:07:20] <BurdRightsActivist> eezo
[3:07:21] <%saiko2208> I actually love DAI
[3:07:22] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> It must be terrifying going against Shep just charging at you like a mad man
[3:07:26] <%Faultlined> Man I cant wait till Kai Leng shows up again I think that guy is really cool and strong
[3:07:27] <MaritimeSpanker> eh
[3:07:29] <%moonmintparadise> Dragon Age 1 is legitimately one of the best games. It took me a good 28 hours to beat it once
[3:07:30] <Gruhunchously> Yeah but you could also spend a lot of time on The Witcher 3 and probably have a better ti,e
[3:07:33] <Virokwet> personal 8 as its my genre and the mp was cool
[3:07:33] <%jillyrancher> Get out of the Hinterlands, Pat.
[3:07:33] <DatAsuna> I 98%'d that game and the 2% was bugged quests lol
[3:07:34] <$NoctisxMog> I like looking at inquisition I don't like playing it
[3:07:38] <TheAntiNihilist> what's wrong with Inquisition?   I didn't like it much, but why specifically?
[3:07:39] <MaritimeSpanker> I liked the DA2 Qunari better
[3:07:39] <Coystick> The MMO bloat in Inq completely scared me off
[3:07:41] <%SirGO0SE> @SveriSageAdvice did  that even come out  lol
[3:07:45] <%X2Eliah> See, we could say that Witcer 3 > any dragon age stuff, butnwither 3 turned into cyberpunk so that's off the table now too
[3:07:45] <TheLocalRival> Most western RPGs end up devolving to "Good Choice" "Bad Choice" "Question"
[3:07:46] <DatAsuna> it was not worth it
[3:07:48] <+Goraka91> @Mattais88 I must be one of the only people that thinks DA2 was better than Inquisition, even if it was unfinished as hell
[3:07:50] <%dooscent> BioWare is kinda the absolute worst at the Ubi-style of Open World Design
[3:07:50] <MaritimeSpanker> the only really good part of DA2
[3:07:51] <Sp3ctre48> people gripe a lot about ME3's last half, but Inquisition's ending is so nothing that I don't even remember what happens in it
[3:07:56] <Dova573> oh Andromeda would be the best game ever to a kid whos first Me game is that
[3:07:59] <%peachy996> @DatAsuna Do you know where the Stupid Frisbee gun is in this DLC?
[3:08:06] <%SpoonheadInExile> I frankly hated the Cooldown MMO moves in Inquisition
[3:08:09] <%peachy996> Chakram Launcher
[3:08:10] <%Garthunox> isnt Iron Bull voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr too?
[3:08:12] <%jillyrancher> I'd rather play Dragon Age Inquisition over Witcher 3, hottest take
[3:08:16] <TheLocalRival> and dude Inquisition was a joke when I turned the mage into the knight mage and basically had super armor the whole game
[3:08:17] <%X2Eliah> This leve is just poorly lot
[3:08:17] <SeruraRenge> yes
[3:08:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> @SirGO0SE it did and people shat all over it for being terrible, one review saying that they got tired of Toby Fox's music on the final boss because the game was that bad
[3:08:20] <+trackles_64> turn up the brightness
[3:08:20] <GustauveVIII> Would Pat prefer a familiar control system like DA2 or Inquisition in Dragon Age 4 or actiony like mass effect?
[3:08:25] <%hereiam407> Eh, allows more creative level design?
[3:08:28] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 compeltely forget. lol Probably in the last run to afterlife
[3:08:33] <%unhuggable1> even with outlined targest its sill hard
[3:08:38] <%X2Eliah> They had a much better color balancing in the MP maps
[3:08:40] <%Daxalog> Its like playing Apex Legends
[3:08:41] <Coystick> Just make dense, 40ish hour, repayable RPGs.  So much better than 100hr deathmarches.
[3:08:44] <%FunkyStreams> they went full ambiance in some areas and had to retro fit the targeting system, i would think.
[3:08:45] <DatAsuna> @GustauveVIII dragon's dogma it up
[3:08:49] <%Mattais88> @Goraka91 I got a few hours into DAI before I dropped it, but 100%'d da2 numerous times
[3:08:50] <%Conscript_Gary> That might speak more to the level design in this DLC yeah
[3:08:53] <Virokwet> up brightness?
[3:08:53] <%MelBrooksKA> I vaguely remember Pat being really positive about Inquisition on the podcast, am I misremembering that or does the game just drop off super hard?
[3:08:54] <%Scevda> That sounds like poor light quality
[3:08:55] <%peachy996> Hm. Gun is dumb anyway but I think it's at the last part of this mine section
[3:09:00] <SeruraRenge> my favorite dev right now is Owlcat Games, I just wish their games weren't so goddamn buggy the first few months of release
[3:09:05] <%Scevda> @x2eliah tru
[3:09:09] <+dd44dostivei> big readiness score
[3:09:14] <+Goraka91> @Mattais88 Mm, Inqusition was just so...generic RPG game
[3:09:16] <%hereiam407> Path of Neo?
[3:09:23] <TheLocalRival> Inquisition just has such poor story scenes at times
[3:09:28] <DatAsuna> @MelBrooksKA it has good stuff deeper in as well, it just has tons and tons of filler bloat in between
[3:09:30] <Javier9563> pathfinder: wrath of the righteous?
[3:09:33] <%FunkyStreams> what?
[3:09:35] <%andrewofbob> Path of Exile?
[3:09:35] <%Faultlined> Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous
[3:09:36] <@Spydurman> Path of Ligma
[3:09:39] <SeruraRenge> like I'm playing Wrath of the Righteous, the game just completely starts falling apart in act 3 because there's so many bugs
[3:09:39] <%Aeoneth> Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous?
[3:09:42] <%Scevda> @melbrookska critical path vs the whole experience i think
[3:09:45] <%peachy996> Ooh
[3:09:46] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS

[3:09:54] <SaltyAzteca> What?
[3:09:54] <notsoy> is this Weinstein Road or Epstein Road?
[3:09:54] <%X2Eliah> its not even a real name
[3:09:58] <%SpcOpsBear> IT MEANS "PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY"
[3:09:58] <BurdRightsActivist> PEDWAY

[3:10:12] <%peachy996> That gun is stupid
[3:10:12] <%Torus1025> A...aria, why do you have this?
[3:10:12] <%stantheman_97> LUL
[3:10:12] <%ahomeschooldropout> I just enjoyed how Mandalore referred to Pathfinder as "Catholic D&D"
[3:10:16] <guiltyboya> awkward
[3:10:17] <mattynezz> It leads to the Meadows
[3:10:17] <TG_Cid11> How hard is walkway
[3:10:18] <DatAsuna> chakram is big memes

[3:10:23] <%Daxalog> Chakrams in Mass Effect?
[3:10:23] <%AmericanSkidd> do you know the pedway?
[3:10:30] <%Mattais88> What about Pedometer?
[3:10:31] <%warpath1911> did pat get the couch yet?
[3:10:33] <RaidenRising> meadows time
[3:10:35] <dekkitout> I thought it meant ped as in foot?
[3:10:36] <%JamesCorck> Ugh, goddamnit.
[3:10:36] <%SWFanatic> pedway hurts you shepard
[3:10:39] <mattynezz> Pedway is a real term
[3:10:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> that turian is suspiciously flat chested...
[3:10:41] <DatAsuna> @warpath1911 no
[3:10:44] <+FingaLights> Like in FF7R when you pick up the Pedometer... And forget what that is
[3:10:45] <James_Quivers> Aria was on the Epstein flight logs
[3:10:46] <+TheBobulus> I was away. Did Pat find the couch? I never did in my playthrough
[3:10:46] <%moonmintparadise> OH I tought it was a misspelled "Speedway"
[3:10:48] <%andrewofbob> No shit
[3:10:50] <%hereiam407> Oh no, nothing happened
[3:10:52] <@Ranryu692> "ped" means "foot" @PatStaresAt
[3:10:54] <%JamesCorck> Can't unsee that now.
[3:10:56] <%Torus1025> Protasia presents: Pedway
[3:10:58] <Coystick> @MightyDuckShoes fucking hell
[3:11:04] <Sp3ctre48> Seeing is great yeah
[3:11:04] <%peachy996> You get the Couch in the section after this
[3:11:07] <JaceDarkstar> no pat your thinking of the pedOway. completely different
[3:11:10] <%hereiam407> Glasses, or contacts?
[3:11:12] <%tyler274> is your eye stuff not laser fixable?
[3:11:12] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> red flag
[3:11:12] <Sp3ctre48> Man this is still going huh
[3:11:16] <tanarath> Ranryu, that's somehow worse
[3:11:17] <intestinal_bleeding> that looks famiilar
[3:11:17] <%zanz_san> holy fucj
[3:11:23] <BurdRightsActivist> Stange, we're in an intermission
[3:11:27] <Gruhunchously> I feel the same way
[3:11:29] <Dova573> You think you will look hotter with galsses pat?
[3:11:35] <Dova573> glasses
[3:11:39] <%hereiam407> Watch out for the quick cutscene of the railing falling
[3:11:43] <MatSmith83> "Stay focused"
[3:11:43] <Foopoof> "be careful" dont tell me what to do
[3:11:44] <+TheBobulus> this DLC is the part of mass effect 3 that I remember the least
[3:11:45] <SilasDrekken> stay frosty
[3:11:46] <+Goraka91> Watch your step alpha bravo tango
[3:11:48] <studleydoorite> would you prefer "there's no danger in this transition zone, player"
[3:11:48] <Gruhunchously> It's like the most non-advice that's ever been
[3:11:49] <Kalakukkoo> Stay frosty
[3:11:50] <%Scevda> Fluff exactly right
[3:11:51] <+FingaLights> I walk with eyes' closed
[3:11:52] <$lotharrio> "Get reckless, player. Probably just some bullshit coming up anyway."
[3:11:53] <+TheBobulus> very forgettable, is what I'm saying
[3:11:54] <Coystick> The only time it's ever meant anything is in Death Stranding
[3:11:54] <%Daxalog> Have we reached that point now?
[3:11:58] <Marpolo13> you mean because you are always doing dangerous stuff so it's kind of a moot thing to say?
[3:11:58] <Xiangchang> Check those corners.
[3:12:01] <RockinLockin> jesus.
[3:12:02] <Tracazoid> "We careful of these grunts godkiller/Primal/Reaper Baby killer"
[3:12:03] <DatAsuna> That's the worst thing about ME3's flashlight sequences, the enemies never attack you without a cutscene first
[3:12:05] <%warpath1911> babe?
[3:12:07] <RockinLockin> Those lines
[3:12:07] <%Dakuu75> JUST HATE-FUCK ALL READY
[3:12:09] <%Tarage> BIG WAR HORNY
[3:12:11] <zhenthrim213> Aria shut up
[3:12:11] <%Mattais88> Unless you're in the Deep Roads, then thye alwys come randomly form the ceiling
[3:12:12] <@QueequegTheater> WHO'S TALKING
[3:12:13] <%hereiam407> Keep your wits about you
[3:12:14] <Shade075> a WARm up
[3:12:14] <mattynezz> It's the same category as Uncharted "platforming"
[3:12:15] <%Mattais88> Fucking Spiders
[3:12:16] <Sp3ctre48> The war starts now that I'M here
[3:12:17] <%peachy996> this DLC Draaaaags
[3:12:21] <BurdRightsActivist> Corners anywhere open attack those eyes
[3:12:24] <%AkronymCLT> Stay Frosty
[3:12:25] <%hereiam407> Damn, that it cool
[3:12:26] <kikoeru_san> Bruh this is written like shit
[3:12:35] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That’s it a war babe, NEXT
[3:12:37] <SeruraRenge> It's a shame this is probably ME3's worst dlc because it's also by far the longest
[3:12:37] <Xiangchang> Oh wow, isn't this a multiplayer map?
[3:12:38] <+Goraka91> @Mattais88 Man fuck those jumpscare shits
[3:12:39] <%hereiam407> That's concept art right there
[3:12:39] <KeystoneA2> The worst thing about the flashlight sections is that you're using a flashlight. We literally have Predator vision goggles in real life right now.
[3:12:40] <BurdRightsActivist> LOOK AT THAT EVIL ASS REACTOR
[3:12:40] <DatAsuna> This right here is the only spot where engineers get class exclusive choices. lol
[3:12:43] <%HairballCT> wow that's totally a fuckin reactor
[3:12:45] <James_Quivers> I feel like fighting in a flashlight scene would suck ass anyway
[3:12:46] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> you cant miss it
[3:12:47] <Gruhunchously> "I don't know what to tell ya, but I'm here sating at a reactor"
[3:12:47] <$lotharrio> I remember this part.
[3:12:52] <%FunkyStreams> yeah the setpieces in this game are really cool, just like Andromeda, actually.
[3:12:55] <mattynezz> This is the best part of the DLC. And it's not that amazing
[3:13:01] <intestinal_bleeding> ah yes it's me, bad guy

[3:13:52] <%Tarage> Big angry
[3:13:52] <%AmuserName> SHE'S CORRODING IT'S AT FIELD!
[3:13:53] <%PocketBearIllustrator> she sounds so angry all the time. :P
[3:13:54] <zhenthrim213> CALM DOWN
[3:13:55] <Sp3ctre48> It's super crazy to me that normal people are part of Cerberus at this point
[3:13:55] <tattleworm> goatse that shit
[3:13:56] <lyzejag> EVANGELION
[3:13:57] <danielmusic_> trinity no!
[3:13:58] <SeruraRenge> Not counting the javik dlc because that barely counts as dlc, for me it's Citadel >>>> Leviathan >>>>>> Omega
[3:13:58] <%Mattais88> Glory to humanity *as he drops a human ony bioweapon*
[3:13:59] <@Ranryu692> I can't not giggle at the special eyes
[3:13:59] <TheAntiNihilist> THE POWER OF ANGER!!!!!
[3:14:00] <BurdRightsActivist> YOU CAN JUST WALK THROUGH IT
[3:14:01] <Dabrikishaw> Unpopular opinion, I like Oleg Petrovsky
[3:14:01] <Gruhunchously> The camera is sure shaking
[3:14:02] <%Conscript_Gary> Goatse time
[3:14:03] <+trackles_64> Genocide
[3:14:04] <glimzemal> apparently she can do that?
[3:14:05] <%faintsmile> this is so stupid
[3:14:06] <%AmuserName> AT FIELDO
[3:14:08] <jorniev> SOME COOL SHIT
[3:14:14] <BurdRightsActivist> GOATSE THE FORCEFIELD
[3:14:15] <kikoeru_san> SHE NEUTRALIZING THE AT FIELD WITH HER OWN
[3:14:15] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat should use 'special eyes Patshep' as his next Vtuber face
[3:14:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> Stop her, Homey!
[3:14:18] <Virokwet> she's summoning teh power of the protagnoist
[3:14:19] <@Spydurman> why can't they climb out?
[3:14:24] <greene411> ROGER. ROGER.
[3:14:26] <Marpolo13> ded
[3:14:32] <+Ropcord> ANGERY
[3:14:33] <RockinLockin> That'd be sick.
[3:14:38] <+Goraka91> I will help mankind by helping the genocidal robots kill everyone! Humanity included!
[3:14:43] <Chester_goes_Berserk> There's a mod for bigger text iirc
[3:14:44] <%andrewofbob> @Spydurman It's a cover based shooter
[3:14:46] <jorniev> CANT THEY CLIMB UP THOSE TOWERS?
[3:14:46] <TheLocalRival> I wonder how much money the Mass Effect bad guys have wasted on trying to kill shepard
[3:14:49] <+TheBobulus> I'm surprised there's not pc mods
[3:14:50] <+trackles_64> just listen to the dialouge
[3:14:50] <DatAsuna> ME3 was the last game where bioware stubbornly refused to do gamepads on PC
[3:14:52] <+MightyDuckShoes> Shepard Stares At
[3:14:56] <%Mattais88> Or braek out a ps3
[3:14:56] <knight_verse> Do it, I dare you.
[3:14:56] <triangularblasphemy> Why did we design the robots to scream?
[3:14:56] <Sp3ctre48> Dude I watched MrFeel play Origins recently, I do not remember the text being so tiny LUL
[3:14:57] <Coystick> It's a crpg man, crpgs with controllers are crimes
[3:14:57] <%Scevda> Origins is gooood
[3:14:58] <Foopoof> peepee shot
[3:14:58] <%RealThiele> that exists with mods likely
[3:14:58] <tattleworm> remaster incoming, i guarantee it
[3:14:59] <triangularblasphemy> In pain?
[3:15:00] <%X2Eliah> Dragon Age Origins is also reallu visually ugly
[3:15:00] <%hereiam407> I will help mankind, by destroying mankind
[3:15:00] <DatAsuna> and offered BS excuses about it too
[3:15:01] <Gruhunchously> Shoot that robot in the dick
[3:15:02] <+Crimsonpajamas > Are there not mods to fix the text?
[3:15:03] <%ElkRiverDog> Any good mods out there?
[3:15:03] <triangularblasphemy> Is this a psyop?
[3:15:05] <Dabrikishaw> I'd love to see you play Dragon Age Origins but I agree about the controller support sucking
[3:15:08] <RockinLockin> kist get the xbob 360 version Kappa
[3:15:12] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> No mods for Origins to fix it?
[3:15:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Goatse faster, Aria
[3:15:22] <digaogrunge> DA1 is ass with a controller
[3:15:31] <tattleworm> just use a steam controller lol
[3:15:31] <knight_verse> Hopefully there's a Dragons Age Legendary Edition.
[3:15:34] <+TheBobulus> this whole sequence falls apart for me because these mechs were so shit in ME2, so I can't take them seriously
[3:15:38] <jorniev> NEVER
[3:15:42] <$lotharrio> No. uwu
[3:15:42] <%Ipsenscastle> I absolutely detest using mouse and keyboard
[3:15:43] <+FingaLights> No.. too hard
[3:15:44] <+trackles_64> M+K is superior you know
[3:15:49] <terrible35> no
[3:15:50] <triangularblasphemy> How is what she is doing even possible
[3:15:53] <+MightyDuckShoes> @burdrightsactivist LUL LUL LUL
[3:15:54] <+dd44dostivei> black mesa is killing my wrist
[3:15:55] <triangularblasphemy> Like what IS that
[3:15:56] <SeruraRenge> @Coystick It's barely a CPRG, it's closer to an MMO-lite.
[3:15:57] <triangularblasphemy> WHAT?!
[3:15:57] <%warpath1911> nah
[3:15:58] <TheLocalRival> Dragon Age Origins is a wonderful game that looks like the book in a library that has remained untouched for years
[3:15:58] <@Ranryu692> if this sold well enough maybe they'll do a Dragon Age remaster and do it
[3:16:02] <DatAsuna> And they fed you bullshit about how not having controller support was to give you the optimal experience
[3:16:02] <%JamesCorck> This game didn't have controller support until the Legendary edition?
[3:16:02] <@Spydurman> are there any single player games where only mouse and keyboard make sense? Besides like AoE?
[3:16:07] <%JamesCorck> That's fucking mental.
[3:16:07] <%hereiam407> Remember when Mass Effect 1 was a Xbox 360 exclusive?
[3:16:11] <mattynezz> Oh shit, @PatStaresAt , Pathfinder doesn't have Controller support, fyi
[3:16:14] <Gruhunchously> How is she pulling apart a hologram with her hands?
[3:16:18] <TheLocalRival> Need a Dragon Age remaster collection so I can romance Sarah again
[3:16:21] <DatAsuna> That's one thing Raycevik is super wrong about, where he says ME3's combat is designed for keyboard. lmao
[3:16:22] <Ekaelis> Sigh...
[3:16:23] <+Shockrates20XX> PC ports of JRPGs are super bad about controllers sometimes.
[3:16:23] <%peachy996> Terrible
[3:16:25] <%hereiam407> They probably just wanted to push consoles onto people
[3:16:26] <tattleworm> AWFUL dialogue
[3:16:27] <dekkitout> You can tell a game is built for console by evaluating the menus, this game is one of em
[3:16:28] <SaltyAzteca> FEEL THE WRATH OF SPECIAL EYES
[3:16:30] <Dabrikishaw> How? Mass Effect 1 was xobx excluive
[3:16:33] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I preferred KBM for ME tbh
[3:16:35] <+FingaLights> I Believed
[3:16:37] <Marpolo13> that would have been nice
[3:16:39] <%peachy996> Leave them behind and find somewhere else to have fun
[3:16:39] <+Shockrates20XX> You have to do witchcraft to get a controller to work right with FF7 on steam.
[3:16:39] <Coystick> Playing a CRPG with a controller is like playing a Souls game with KB+M: Wrong on a moral and universal level.
[3:16:44] <DatAsuna> it's his worst take
[3:16:44] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Thewir dead right?
[3:16:47] <triangularblasphemy> "How did you know how to do that?" "Iunno"
[3:16:48] <%Scevda> @spydurman lol was about to say AoE as the example but you got it already
[3:16:49] <DatAsuna> on ME3 at least
[3:16:50] <%JamesCorck> This coming part is where the Engineer prompt is, the one and only class specific prompt in the whole series. Why they never did more, I dunno.
[3:16:51] <Vinicius_75> DAO is kinda ass with a controller
[3:16:53] <shallaska> if it was, the spacebar wouldn't be used for literally every single action
[3:16:55] <Profmcstevie> Then what the fuck was it doing being built for xbox then huh
[3:17:00] <SeruraRenge> @mattynezz Well yeah the creators said that it's a PC game first and foremost and is meant to be played with a pc
[3:17:05] <%AmuserName> ME3 Sprinting feels better with mouselook. Accidental improvement in design.
[3:17:05] <TheLocalRival> Pat is activating Crazy Talk right now
[3:17:06] <DatAsuna> Otherwise his years later videos are good, but that stood out as silly
[3:17:06] <%RealThiele> ***  text size exists
[3:17:12] <%SWFanatic> you can tell because spacebar does everything
[3:17:15] <%X2Eliah> It literally has like 10 different functions on Spacebar
[3:17:20] <digaogrunge> Most shooters are better with K&M
[3:17:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> StarCraft is only truly enjoyed with the N64 controller
[3:17:22] <Gruhunchously> Garrus' textures are broken
[3:17:23] <%Conscript_Gary> YEET
[3:17:29] <%dooscent> the controller UI for ME1 was still actually in the game, just actively disabled. it's like they wanted you to suffer for playing it on PC.
[3:17:35] <Coystick> Well yeah, Mass Effect is set in Space
[3:17:38] <%andrewofbob> The PC version of ME3 STILL has the chimera of the use/sprint/cover button
[3:17:40] <DatAsuna> Have you ever seen the OLD OLD ME1 gameplay demos where the lighting was super high contract and the combat was all lock on? lol
[3:17:41] <studleydoorite> robot with a gun just runs at him screaming LUL
[3:17:46] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:17:47] <TheLocalRival> @MightyDuckShoes A true king/Queen
[3:17:48] <DatAsuna> Before they got the official shepard face too
[3:17:51] <%Scevda> Ot played just fine for me, which is weird since i know that was not common
[3:17:51] <%AmuserName> HUGE QWERTY
[3:17:51] <%Solid_Stro> Diablo 1 on Ps1 is the best version Kappa
[3:17:52] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I remember Garrus' fucked up blurry face on the PC port
[3:17:56] <BurdRightsActivist> GIANT KEYBOARD
[3:17:58] <%Treasure_Vault> Is this the engineer interrupt?
[3:18:02] <+FingaLights> Everyone uses QWERTY
[3:18:02] <Aoworth> The keys are ENORMOUS
[3:18:04] <dekkitout> S-shut up, translators man
[3:18:04] <SaltyAzteca> HIS EYES
[3:18:04] <triangularblasphemy> Did he need the hologram for this?
[3:18:05] <DatAsuna> god those eyeballs
[3:18:05] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[3:18:06] <triangularblasphemy> Just call me
[3:18:08] <TheLocalRival> LMFAO ZOINKIES with the eyes
[3:18:08] <Coystick> Those fucking eyes
[3:18:08] <jorniev> BECAUSE CERBERUS
[3:18:08] <Gruhunchously> Moral choice time
[3:18:09] <BurdRightsActivist> GRANDMA REMOTE KEYBOARD
[3:18:09] <%peachy996> ZOOM IN ON EYES
[3:18:10] <mattynezz> MORAL CHOICES
[3:18:12] <+Diz001> The EYES!
[3:18:13] <%senfood> MY BRAND
[3:18:14] <James_Quivers> Because cerberus probably uses english as default
[3:18:14] <%Scevda> Because cerberus
[3:18:15] <+dd44dostivei> there's english all over the citadel
[3:18:16] <RLT917> jaboodyLUL
[3:18:16] <%AmericanSkidd> the only actual keyboard in the game
[3:18:16] <mr_saturday93> If you're a engineer you get a paragon option
[3:18:19] <%Daxalog> Oh no the little keypad
[3:18:19] <TheAntiNihilist> EYE ZOOMIES
[3:18:20] <BurdRightsActivist> LUL JUST KILL THEM LUL
[3:18:20] <%SpcOpsBear> So there's a special Paragon interrupt in this section if you're an Engineer
[3:18:24] <%FunkyStreams> MUST FOCUS
[3:18:24] <Tracazoid> I'm so glad the eye glitch is a consistent, repeatable thing
[3:18:25] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> MY BRAND LUL
[3:18:26] <intestinal_bleeding> what is this a megabyte dialogue
[3:18:26] <+ryuguitarfreak> PERFECT
[3:18:28] <%warpath1911> this is so stupid
[3:18:29] <@Ranryu692> no, shutting it all down is the renegade prompt
[3:18:29] <%JamesCorck> Press that button and a lot of people die.
[3:18:29] <knight_verse> Shepard needs to lay off the coke.
[3:18:29] <Dabrikishaw> Enginneers shine here
[3:18:30] <tattleworm> renegade is overloading the reactor
[3:18:32] <intestinal_bleeding> this is a reboot moment
[3:18:33] <+Goraka91> LUL
[3:18:34] <Vinicius_75> man your shepard looking like a shi tzu
[3:18:34] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> So this part changes if you're engineer I believe
[3:18:34] <guiltyboya> GlitchCat Renegades kill for the lulz
[3:18:36] <Javier9563> because you're shutting the power and killing thousands of people?
[3:18:37] <SaltyAzteca> PANIC
[3:18:41] <SeruraRenge> @digaogrunge There is literally no reason to play an FPS with a controller. That's like the idiots who think Doom was designed with arrow key aiming in mind
[3:18:42] <+Ropcord> look at those huge keys how are you supposed to type like a human LUL
[3:18:43] <Sp3ctre48> Why does she sound like she's on the radio when it cuts back to her?
[3:18:45] <SaltyAzteca> FORCED PANIC! PANIC HARDER!
[3:18:46] <%unhuggable1> no
[3:18:46] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: Engineers can skip the reactor moral dilemma sequence entirely.
[3:18:49] <mattynezz> To be INTENSE
[3:18:49] <studleydoorite> he's downloading Space Cadet Pinball
[3:18:50] <Gruhunchously> Why is this scene being presented so poorly
[3:18:50] <+Goraka91> Definitely
[3:18:51] <dr_lucien_sanchez_> MY BRAND
[3:18:54] <Marpolo13> it WOULD
[3:18:58] <triangularblasphemy> BUTTON
[3:18:59] <jorniev> engenier would have done it by now
[3:19:00] <%Scevda> Behold, the ONLY time to player class has an influence on choices.
[3:19:01] <triangularblasphemy> LOVE BUTTON
[3:19:03] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I wish there were more class specific prompts
[3:19:04] <Sp3ctre48> Dude you're a space racist shut up
[3:19:04] <guiltyboya> THE TEMPTATION
[3:19:06] <%peachy996> Who cares
[3:19:07] <triangularblasphemy> PUSH???
[3:19:07] <%DoubleRrico> the eyes really add to the tension
[3:19:07] <%SWFanatic> beep boop
[3:19:09] <Profmcstevie> Man that buttons real temptin
[3:19:11] <%PocketBearIllustrator> the f bomb in a Sci fi storyline? :O
[3:19:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Engineer players get a unique prompt
[3:19:16] <spuginky> UNGA Big Button
[3:19:18] <%TheHateFish> @GustauveVIII Yeah, this is my first time actually seeing this sequence because of that.
[3:19:20] <+trackles_64> press the button
[3:19:21] <%watts121> The writers didn't write the outcome.
[3:19:22] <%unhuggable1> same outcome
[3:19:22] <Woodywoo0100> Unless your an engineer
[3:19:23] <Gruhunchously> No but press the button though
[3:19:23] <Srthunda> just grab that mans orb and crush it
[3:19:26] <%unhuggable1> there is no difference
[3:19:27] <%peachy996> Omega is so small time compared to the general plight the universe is in
[3:19:28] <%Garthunox> This is the unique engineer prompt place
[3:19:29] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Engineer gets a prompt here
[3:19:29] <%Daxalog> It is cool that they repeatedly offer it to you. But yeah.
[3:19:29] <SeruraRenge> @PatStaresAt If you were playing an engineer you can ignore the moral choice and get the best option
[3:19:30] <%Mattais88> They imply aria will die, but don't follow through
[3:19:31] <guiltyboya> "Do you want to press big red button? Like Don't you really?!"
[3:19:31] <%Tarage> Hit the button and a buncha people die iirc
[3:19:31] <$lotharrio> Hit the button for button.
[3:19:32] <intestinal_bleeding> from aria being a big meanie I guess
[3:19:32] <%Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[3:19:34] <tattleworm> you overload the reactor to drop the shields but also fuck over civilians
[3:19:36] <Dabrikishaw> There's no difference.
[3:19:38] <James_Quivers> I do like how Oleg trolls you as a VI projection, I'd do that too
[3:19:42] <SaltyAzteca> THAT SHITTY RUN
[3:19:44] <%Scevda> Saving them slower
[3:19:44] <mattynezz> Aria getting killed
[3:19:45] <+Gamblor69> That run animation lmao
[3:19:46] <%Mattais88> no they don't
[3:19:47] <BurdRightsActivist> FPS
[3:19:47] <guiltyboya> They don't
[3:19:47] <Marpolo13> BUT SHE DONT
[3:19:51] <+FingaLights> Win win
[3:19:53] <%Daxalog> THERE RUNNING IN PLACE
[3:19:53] <%faintsmile> so basically it doesnt actually matter right
[3:19:54] <mattynezz> Except she doesn't get killed no matter what
[3:19:58] <%andrewofbob> It looked like Nyreen more more dying than Aria, ffs
[3:19:59] <JaceDarkstar> the button kills people on the station and shuts down the sheild
[3:20:00] <Dabrikishaw> Aria doesn't even die here. Neither does Nyreen
[3:20:01] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> the omega dlc is really fucky
[3:20:04] <%watts121> I thought overloading the reactor would kill a bunch of civillians
[3:20:04] <%Ipsenscastle> I fucking hate this DLC
[3:20:07] <%stantheman_97> THEY DIDN'T MOVE
[3:20:08] <GustauveVIII> is this the only class-based special interrupt IN THE SERIES?
[3:20:11] <%Zebroneath> that force field is so stupid at how short it is
[3:20:12] <knight_verse> Whoever made this dlc wad a hardcore engineer player, wasn't he?
[3:20:13] <+TrevSmith222> Yeah, being an engineer lets you do both.
[3:20:13] <Kayly101> LUL PopCorn Thats hilarious
[3:20:16] <Gruhunchously> Aria will Remember That
[3:20:16] <+BlueLunecy> 👀
[3:20:19] <guiltyboya> Oh shut up Aria
[3:20:20] <%SWFanatic> plot armor too strong
[3:20:21] <rustybuckethead21> yoh, just arrived, but WHERE IS KAI LENG?
[3:20:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> They didn't have the balls to kill her off.
[3:20:25] <+Goraka91> Piss off blue criminal from the Matrix
[3:20:25] <%peachy996> And his eyeballs
[3:20:25] <+FingaLights> Baka
[3:20:26] <+trackles_64> Geeez blussy
[3:20:26] <%watts121> lol Omega is still so buggy.
[3:20:27] <BurdRightsActivist> STFU ARIA
[3:20:27] <+ryuguitarfreak> Oleg is such a cool character in the comics and they did him so bad in this DLC
[3:20:27] <SeruraRenge> I could believe Nyreen dying because she's never existed outside of this dlc. But not Aria
[3:20:27] <DatAsuna> woteva
[3:20:28] <+MightyDuckShoes> man Bioware really forgot what the point of Paragon and Renegade is supposed to stand for. They just gave up and made it bigger words for Good/Evil
[3:20:29] <Coystick> So tsun
[3:20:29] <%faintsmile> who says i applaud him lol
[3:20:31] <%HairballCT> 👁️ 👄 👁️
[3:20:31] <rustybuckethead21> where is that scrub
[3:20:32] <Sp3ctre48> Shepard why didn't you kill thousands of people for me BabyRage
[3:20:33] <lyzejag> WHATEVER
[3:20:33] <rustybuckethead21> ?
[3:20:35] <$lotharrio> Man, Aria is a bad person.
[3:20:35] <triangularblasphemy> These forcefields aren't that hard to get over
[3:20:37] <TheAntiNihilist> but murder is fun?
[3:20:37] <jorniev> IT WAS JUST BOTS ARIA
[3:20:39] <+Goraka91> MY BRAND
[3:20:41] <%SWFanatic> blah blah blah
[3:20:42] <%peachy996> She was doing fine
[3:20:43] <@Spydurman> EYES
[3:20:45] <Druss_M> Those fucking eyes
[3:20:46] <StaceMcGate> my brand
[3:20:47] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> WE KICKED THIER ASSES ARIA THEY SUCK
[3:20:48] <SaltyAzteca> LAY OFF! LOOK AT MY BRAND
[3:20:48] <%blaccbird914> I forgot about the eyes
[3:20:49] <%baronblank> oh my god the eyes LUL
[3:20:49] <Vinicius_75> my god these eyes
[3:20:49] <lyzejag> MY BRAND
[3:20:50] <godila2> LUL
[3:20:51] <intestinal_bleeding> they're not even that scary
[3:20:51] <%Scevda> B-baka
[3:20:51] <+Toshatron> 👀
[3:20:52] <Srthunda> now they are trying to guilt trip you
[3:20:53] <%SpoonheadInExile> WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAACE
[3:20:54] <DatAsuna> so many closeups
[3:20:54] <%jillyrancher> shut the fuck up Aria
[3:20:55] <%faintsmile> what are you, her abusive mother??
[3:20:56] <%AkronymCLT> Aria is a scumbag who has a thing for nags
[3:20:56] <%stantheman_97> LUL
[3:20:56] <MrPandastic> This was the most pointless moral choice.
[3:21:00] <Gruhunchously> Why are they going out of their way to make Aria so unlikable?
[3:21:01] <Vinicius_75> i get a jumpscare everytime they show on screen
[3:21:01] <%peachy996> I swear your eyes get bigger
[3:21:01] <GustauveVIII> GODDAMMIT PUNS
[3:21:03] <jorniev> WHY CANT YOU SEE ARIA
[3:21:03] <greene411> I can shepard can see the microbes on people's skins with those eyes.
[3:21:04] <%PocketBearIllustrator> are they gonna bang?
[3:21:06] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> lol\
[3:21:06] <@Spydurman> even with 20/20 vision
[3:21:09] <Gruhunchously> More Daddy Issues, naturally
[3:21:10] <%watts121> I thought it was just cuz Adjutants are creepy.
[3:21:12] <+ryuguitarfreak> This dlc sucked
[3:21:12] <%andrewofbob> We still need to find the sofa?
[3:21:16] <DatAsuna> it's just the standard zombie dilemma
[3:21:19] <Latija> wait that wasn't the end of the dlc?
[3:21:19] <DatAsuna> "they used to be people"
[3:21:25] <triangularblasphemy> Aria you have to enjoy this at this point
[3:21:25] <SeruraRenge> @MightyDuckShoes Let's be fair, Renegade was never consistent in the series. In 1 it means being a human supremacist, in 2 it means being a psychopath, and in 3 it means being a pragmatic asshole
[3:21:29] <Aiutare47> It is always dads isn’t it
[3:21:31] <triangularblasphemy> Like holy crap what is your damage
[3:21:35] <+MightyDuckShoes> is that still CaryAnn Moss?
[3:21:37] <+Toshatron> OH NO YOUR EYES
[3:21:37] <@Spydurman> why shouldn't Shepard kill Aria and let Talon run everything?
[3:21:37] <+Goraka91> @Gruhunchously Because she's so edgy and cool!
[3:21:37] <%Solid_Stro> They were people… WutFace
[3:21:40] <TheLocalRival> Heyyyy Pats eyes are back to normal
[3:21:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> She is so evil
[3:21:46] <TheLocalRival> when do we get Gief DLC
[3:21:48] <+ryuguitarfreak> Leviathan and Citadel were so good they dropped the ball hard on this one
[3:21:48] <mattynezz> @MightyDuckShoes Yes
[3:22:01] <%peachy996> This DLC is so pointless but I cannot express how pointless this dlc is yet
[3:22:04] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> “Cerberus frontline” not like we’ve seen them with stormtrooper aim
[3:22:05] <Sp3ctre48> Them trashing the Paragon/Renegade system was for the best honestly
[3:22:08] <triangularblasphemy> Aria wants to be the queen of ASHES
[3:22:13] <jorniev> STUPID VILLAINY
[3:22:20] <+trackles_64> murder is fun
[3:22:22] <+FingaLights> People must die
[3:22:24] <bear_breaker20> shes older than you shut up
[3:22:25] <SeruraRenge> It's bad because there's nothing to this dlc beyond being a big shooting gallery. It's the Operation Anchorage of ME dlc
[3:22:25] <TheAntiNihilist> LOVES MURDER
[3:22:26] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> She's not even pragmatic, she's just overly reckless
[3:22:29] <+trackles_64> Shes half way to being morinth
[3:22:30] <%peachy996> And Nyreen's hesitance to fight Adjutants is part of that "shit that went relatively nowhere"
[3:22:30] <guiltyboya> Neutral asshole
[3:22:31] <knight_verse> ShepPat needs to take a hit of coke from time to time to perform better
[3:22:32] <SaltyAzteca> Too headstrong and stubborn
[3:22:34] <$lotharrio> "Good plan. How many civilian deaths are expected?" "None." "Rework it."
[3:22:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> why wouldn't her people betray her by now?
[3:22:36] <%SWFanatic> ammo power
[3:22:36] <RLT917> LUL
[3:22:39] <%andrewofbob> Aria would kill the colonists on Feros
[3:22:40] <%DoubleRrico> because edge
[3:22:45] <+RoByte2> How many Batarians did you kill again?
[3:22:47] <+trackles_64> Shes probaly an ardat yakshi
[3:22:48] <Marpolo13> to the point of being laughable actually
[3:22:48] <mattynezz> Fire Ammo LUL
[3:22:49] <knight_verse> that's why jos eyes look like that.
[3:22:51] <jorniev> SHE FEELS LIKE A REGULAR GANG MEMBER AND NOT A MOB BOSS
[3:22:52] <Gruhunchously> It's like 'do we even want to put her back in a position of power?;
[3:22:53] <Sp3ctre48> It's like, there needs to be a moral dilemma no matter what, even if it makes certain characters look really stupid
[3:22:53] <Aoworth> She's got the same problem with a lot of the Renegade choices, where it's not even evil as much as just being a raging fucking asshole
[3:22:55] <%warpath1911> she was much better in ME2
[3:22:55] <+dd44dostivei> earth is getting glassed
[3:22:55] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> I believe that's called a sociopath
[3:22:59] <knight_verse> *his
[3:22:59] <DatAsuna> Jade Empire is the only Bioware game with a good evil villain imho
[3:23:00] <%peachy996> The Couch is somewhere here
[3:23:03] <%Scevda> ORPHAN PLAN
[3:23:04] <James_Quivers> If the percentage chance of gettign what she wants is even slightly off, she says fuck it, but yeah she's a warlord, that's what they do
[3:23:05] <Dova573> This DLC is kinda ruining Aria Huh
[3:23:05] <%FunkyStreams> its like the writing is almost not good
[3:23:08] <Dhrall> She thinks she's ruthless but she's actually just kind of totally lacking in impulse control and really edgy
[3:23:09] <+ryuguitarfreak> Did Pat play Leviathan yet?
[3:23:11] <DatAsuna> maybe darth thanaton too
[3:23:12] <@Spydurman> Aria isn't tough or ruthless, she's just a dumbass
[3:23:15] <%peachy996> Or is it? That couch is hard to find
[3:23:17] <Ids560> eh she wasn't much better in 2
[3:23:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> @serurarenge Yeah. At first my understanding of it was that it was like playing as Danny Glover or Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon. Riggs and Murthow?
[3:23:23] <goodcraz> they want you to think arias a genius but she comes off like an idiot
[3:23:24] <DatAsuna> @ryuguitarfreak no
[3:23:25] <intestinal_bleeding> the mr krabs shimmy yes
[3:23:25] <RockinLockin> ME2 is generally just a better written game imo
[3:23:28] <%Scevda> @ryuguitarfreak not yet
[3:23:30] <RoldanDgr8> she was kinda bad in me2 as well
[3:23:31] <+JustToWatch> apparently the couch is here
[3:23:33] <triangularblasphemy> @Raven_In_A_Tree I think even a sociopath might consider the value of people to rule, or would appreciate presenting themselves as good for personal gain
[3:23:36] <triangularblasphemy> Aria is WILD
[3:23:37] <mattynezz> Was she better in ME2? She had like no lines
[3:23:39] <%Scevda> @rockinlockin correct
[3:23:40] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[3:23:42] <%warpath1911> couch!
[3:23:44] <SeruraRenge> "It's kinda fucked you had to kill 3 million Batarians Shepard, but we know you had to stop the Reapers." "Reapers?"
[3:23:44] <Srthunda> she was so much better in me2
[3:23:45] <Sp3ctre48> We never really talked to Aria that much in ME2 tbf
[3:23:45] <+trackles_64> Bioware gpt lazy with ME3
[3:23:46] <DatAsuna> She wasn't better in ME2, she just had other characters talking her up is all
[3:23:50] <mattynezz> She just said "I'm bad ass" and nothing else
[3:23:50] <+ryuguitarfreak> I see. Thanks everybody
[3:23:54] <Aiutare47> I think she was just less present in ME2.
[3:23:55] <%watts121> Jade Empire is also had gay relationships when Mass Effect didn't.
[3:23:55] <Gruhunchously> She didn't really do anything in ME2, maybe that's the difference
[3:23:58] <%peachy996> I don't wanna One Guy you about the Couch but it does look familiar where I found it
[3:24:00] <%watts121> at first
[3:24:03] <+Ropcord> she was better because she didn't have enough screentime to be garbage
[3:24:09] <Manderfuzz> what difficulty is Pat playing on?
[3:24:10] <%peachy996> You'll definitely spot the couch in a bin
[3:24:16] <%Scevda> Couch will be down a ladder in a canal space
[3:24:17] <knight_verse> Just saying but ME2 wasn't any better written.
[3:24:21] <%Solid_Stro> Aira is basically final season Daenerys, just pointlessly cruel
[3:24:25] <@Ranryu692> he doesn't have to worry about the couch while he's fighting
[3:24:30] <James_Quivers> Yeah, Aria is barely a character in ME2, she has the one line about not fucking with her and then she just serves as a go-to for side quests, hard to 'RUIN' that, lol
[3:24:31] <%RealThiele> the xbox 360 version of dragon age origins had controller support LUL
[3:24:32] <godila2> couch is then you lower water levels
[3:24:33] <triangularblasphemy> Aria is at her best when she is dismissing you from her presence, or talking about her crimes like they are distant
[3:24:45] <%Tarage> Big miss
[3:24:46] <PaperyHornet1013> couch
[3:24:46] <%watts121> ME2 is the Empire Strikes back of Mass Effect...IE the best one
[3:24:48] <%KaiserMario> Stars
[3:24:50] <%DoubleRrico> did not at mind being on fire
[3:24:52] <BurdRightsActivist> NOTHIN PERSONNEL
[3:24:53] <%peachy996> Havin fun yet?
[3:24:56] <+ryuguitarfreak> The setup for this dlc in the comics is MUCH better than this lol
[3:24:57] <%andrewofbob> Pat: "Fight me"; sniper: "No"
[3:24:58] <triangularblasphemy> She fails the "roadtrip" test, where the second you are stuck with her on a mission you realize her badassness is really shallow, and she's kind of a moron
[3:25:00] <TheAntiNihilist> are you feeling the fun yet?
[3:25:01] <SeruraRenge> the most annoying thing in this dlc? If you don't complete any of the quests in it and then finish the dlc, those quests just stay there in the top of your log FOREVER
[3:25:04] <godila2> pat couch is there ladder down
[3:25:09] <tanarath> Pat, Couch
[3:25:10] <%SWFanatic> or you could just vanguard across
[3:25:12] <mattynezz> That ladder for couch I think
[3:25:19] <%Tarage> Paaaaaat get cooooough
[3:25:19] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt look for ladders down
[3:25:21] <%X2Eliah> ladder down
[3:25:24] <Javier9563> pat ladder
[3:25:24] <%X2Eliah> pat
[3:25:24] <%Scevda> @triangularblasphemy a nigty name for that.
[3:25:24] <%JamesCorck> The music of the DLC is the worst.
[3:25:25] <Marpolo13> what was the point of that other than to waste like 10 seconds
[3:25:25] <%peachy996> The couch
[3:25:26] <tanarath> Pat, ladder down
[3:25:26] <%warpath1911> the Ladder!
[3:25:26] <%X2Eliah> paaat
[3:25:27] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt go into the canal
[3:25:27] <SeruraRenge> LADDER
[3:25:28] <DatAsuna> couch missed
[3:25:29] <%Mattais88> ldder
[3:25:29] <%X2Eliah> paaat uh
[3:25:29] <%SilverReamalus> Blind
[3:25:29] <godila2> ladder
[3:25:32] <%JamesCorck> The DLC's have terrible music, all of them.
[3:25:32] <BurdRightsActivist> LADDER
[3:25:33] <Gruhunchously> Aria is pretty much all reputation and no substance
[3:25:34] <+dd44dostivei> goku district
[3:25:34] <glimzemal> back
[3:25:34] <%watts121> When does he get the Pirahna?
[3:25:35] <%Tarage> But paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatuh
[3:25:37] <%warpath1911> NO!
[3:25:39] <%Scevda> Ladder
[3:25:39] <%JamesCorck> The music on Citadel is awful.
[3:25:39] <BurdRightsActivist> PATUHHHHH LADDERUHH
[3:25:43] <tanarath> @patstaresat counch
[3:25:44] <knight_verse> The only good line Aria has in ME2 is "I AM Omega".
[3:25:47] <%warpath1911> the Ladder!
[3:25:47] <triangularblasphemy> @Scevda Thanks!
[3:25:48] <mattynezz> LADDER No couch for Pat
[3:25:51] <%kekkerscrew> is this the first DCL Pat's done?
[3:25:56] <godila2> fuck this couch
[3:25:58] <Gruhunchously> They really phoned in the music for this DLC
[3:25:59] <+ryuguitarfreak> The music on Citadel is GREAT
[3:26:02] <%JamesCorck> No.,
[3:26:05] <@Ranryu692> it's not a very good surprise if she's there when you find it
[3:26:06] <%watts121> wait was it under water?
[3:26:06] <%JamesCorck> Second DLC he's done.
[3:26:07] <%andrewofbob> 1800 is a fat recovery fee
[3:26:08] <fetelgeuse> This DLC is the only place I ended up out of the level geometry. Aria's fat ass knocked me down a ladder and into the void of space.
[3:26:08] <guiltyboya> "okay, I walk the Pedway" TADADA TADADA TADADADA! MrDestructoid
[3:26:08] <DatAsuna> yay credits
[3:26:12] <GustauveVIII> pat LOVES having uncompleted missions forever in his mission log
[3:26:12] <SaltyAzteca> WAS your couch
[3:26:14] <%peachy996> There. Now back to being bored
[3:26:16] <Gruhunchously> Aria, nobody cares about your stupid couch
[3:26:21] <%JamesCorck> The music in Citadel is really bad, it's all blips and bloops.
[3:26:24] <%kekkerscrew> what did he do before?
[3:26:24] <PaperyHornet1013> we did it chat we saved the playthrough
[3:26:31] <%Solid_Stro> Riveting side quests
[3:26:33] <SneakyCorpse> well, that was kinda cool
[3:26:33] <%warpath1911> @Gruhunchously Harrot does
[3:26:35] <Sp3ctre48> Well, ME3 doesn't have the best ost in the world to begin with honestly
[3:26:37] <+ryuguitarfreak> Sam Hulick is the actual best composer in the series
[3:26:38] <@Ranryu692> experience?
[3:26:45] <%peachy996> Because it's one long shooting gallery
[3:26:47] <%X2Eliah> This dlc is crazy thick with enemies
[3:26:48] <RoldanDgr8> how bizarre?
[3:26:51] <%peachy996> So you get more EXP
[3:26:54] <%SpcOpsBear> ME3 soundtrack good, Omega DLC soundtrack baaaad
[3:26:58] <%watts121> Wait isn't Cryo Ammo better than Inferno Ammo?
[3:27:00] <BurdRightsActivist> "level stuff" LUL
[3:27:00] <bear_breaker20> this dlc is at the 'i dont care' portion of the game
[3:27:01] <knight_verse> it's called Exp Pat.
[3:27:08] <%KaiserMario> "now"
[3:27:10] <+ryuguitarfreak> ME3 score is really fuckin' good though
[3:27:12] <%HairballCT> trashman shepard
[3:27:13] <@Ranryu692> I like "level stuff"
[3:27:14] <Gruhunchously> @ryuguitarfreak I think you might be right
[3:27:21] <FlyguyJP> Seeing Pat's bald head just appear and then just vanish
[3:27:21] <+dd44dostivei> earth is being glassed
[3:27:27] <DatAsuna> @watts121 depends on what other powers you have and what you're fighting
[3:27:32] <SeruraRenge> @watts121 Not if you make certain builds that let you maximize the inferno ammo explosions
[3:27:34] <TheLocalRival> Lol who doesn't love an empty room with tons of enemies
[3:27:37] <DSD24> I love doing Nova bombs
[3:27:44] <%logoth_> kill rm all 2589
[3:27:55] <%watts121> I just remember freezing and exploding people in my run
[3:27:59] <+ryuguitarfreak> cryo is great for squadmates
[3:28:03] <knight_verse> Can't wait to grond some "level stuff" when I play Pokemon or Persona.
[3:28:09] <+jordy_j_s> lol what happened to his eyes?
[3:28:14] <knight_verse> *grind
[3:28:15] <DSD24> One hundred 10 billion dead Cerberus members
[3:28:17] <Marpolo13> this never ends does it
[3:28:18] <terrible35> 34 billion dead cops, kill em all
[3:28:21] <%Dakuu75> space-future still has "manual" and "analog"?
[3:28:27] <SeruraRenge> this is the worst room in the game
[3:28:28] <Gruhunchously> Oh hey it's that one mission from the beginning of ME1
[3:28:31] <+ryuguitarfreak> cryo for squadmates almost breaks the game
[3:28:32] <%Scevda> @dsd24 illusive man is a fuck
[3:28:37] <SeruraRenge> or in the dlc at least
[3:28:38] <%coward_man> she didn't say she'd do it "good"
[3:28:40] <Sp3ctre48> Do YOU want to rely on AI teammates to defend you?
[3:28:48] <%logoth_> 257 billion dead cops
[3:28:49] <tattleworm> you need to plug your kinect in to give your squadmates verbal commands @PatStaresAt
[3:28:55] <DSD24> @Scevda I'm a Biotic Trash Man
[3:28:58] <knight_verse> @dakuu75 ... Yes, also Omega is a really old space station.
[3:29:00] <%peachy996> Reminds me of MP Objectives
[3:29:04] <FlyguyJP> TURRET
[3:29:06] <glimzemal> she's terrible  that's why
[3:29:12] <dekkitout> In Destiny 2?
[3:29:12] <%Scevda> @tattleworm oof dont remind me
[3:29:12] <Marpolo13> @Sp3ctre48 would I want to? No. Would it be nice? kinda
[3:29:12] <%coward_man> it reminds me of the final boss in Downpour
[3:29:13] <%jillyrancher> for me it went like "I'll handle Cerberus" and then she immediately goes down.
[3:29:22] <%watts121> The amount of Cerberus troops literally makes no sense. Now if they kept Cerberus "morally grey" it would have made sense if and indoctrinated Alliance Admiral had this many troops.
[3:29:29] <dekkitout> Cause that Nightfall is next week and it sucks ass
[3:29:36] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> this is MP but not fun
[3:29:37] <DSD24> Oh I remember that mission
[3:29:40] <guiltyboya> I love how the gameplay here is basically TOTSUGEKI
[3:29:40] <%coward_man> oh fuck that dungeon
[3:29:41] <+BigChiefBear> hey im in that right now lol
[3:29:44] <DSD24> Riskrunner was a great gun
[3:29:50] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean one of the only vanilla strikes they didnt put in the vault @PatStaresAt
[3:29:58] <%Daxalog> How the hell does a Dungeon work in Destiny? Theyre arent roles?
[3:30:03] <BurdRightsActivist> DESTINY LUL
[3:30:03] <%octavian_wolf> shittiest, but among the fastest
[3:30:06] <dekkitout> Wait-
[3:30:08] <+ryuguitarfreak> Cerberus goes back on stupid evil for ME3
[3:30:16] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> That strike was removed from playlists though right?
[3:30:17] <%andrewofbob> If it's the first, it's the one players have learned, and they're lazy
[3:30:17] <%Retinolgaming> moon2W
[3:30:20] <%Scevda> @daxalog everyone shoots
[3:30:20] <dekkitout> Does Pat now know about TheCorrupted strike
[3:30:23] <mr_saturday93> yeah cuz Nesses is still on D2
[3:30:23] <dekkitout> For GM's?
[3:30:24] <+Goraka91> @watts121 Didn't Cerberus have that planet they used for 'refugees' to turn them into soldiers?
[3:30:27] <DatAsuna> I want to like destiny but they do a good job of not letting me
[3:30:28] <triangularblasphemy> oooh Phaestron
[3:30:29] <Foopoof> garrus?
[3:30:30] <%kettleroot> i remember they said that it was accidentally weighted to appear more at launch
[3:30:32] <knight_verse> @watts121 They are abducting and indoctrinating people outside of the idiots that join them, it's not that unbelievable
[3:30:36] <%SpcOpsBear> The sound design on these cutscenes are horrible too
[3:30:40] <%X2Eliah> yup
[3:30:40] <%JamesCorck> You wish.
[3:30:41] <+trackles_64> That would of been dope
[3:30:42] <Sp3ctre48> @watts121 They probably could have done something like, many humans have lost faith in the Alliance and Shepard being with Cerberus for a while influenced tons of people to join up with them
[3:30:45] <%X2Eliah> sure does
[3:30:46] <%peachy996> Play an Alien? Not in SP
[3:30:46] <TheAntiNihilist> ...I'm so bored by this right now
[3:30:47] <$lotharrio> You'd think the Turians would be more protective of the only female Turian in the galaxy.
[3:30:48] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> that would actually be cool
[3:30:48] <triangularblasphemy> ptchoo ptchoo
[3:30:49] <%peachy996> You wish
[3:30:52] <BurdRightsActivist> wWOULD'VE BEEN GOOD
[3:30:55] <triangularblasphemy> WHERE ARE THE GUNSHOTS
[3:30:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @DatAsuna the classic wow problem of loving a game but it not loving you
[3:31:00] <James_Quivers> That's for the MP only
[3:31:00] <studleydoorite> her own troops were just shooting passed her feet away from her on both sides
[3:31:01] <%Tarage> I want to call her Nyanners
[3:31:03] <%Scevda> nope
[3:31:05] <%JamesCorck> They did, in the third novel.
[3:31:07] <DSD24> They have a lot of sleeper units
[3:31:09] <%coward_man> they do explain it
[3:31:09] <+CookieCutter007> those eyes
[3:31:09] <PaperyHornet1013> they do
[3:31:11] <%ahomeschooldropout> they do towards the end but it doesn't make sense
[3:31:13] <Aiutare47> Maybe they will.
[3:31:13] <%andrewofbob> @Goraka91 That's a "priority" mission we haven't hit, yet. So, spoilers.
[3:31:13] <@Ranryu692> there's more game to play
[3:31:15] <%Scevda> @tarage lol
[3:31:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> it'd be better if there wasn;t
[3:31:16] <SeruraRenge> there is no answer
[3:31:16] <Virokwet> i think they do...
[3:31:17] <+trackles_64> @triangularblasphemy  you cant hear gunshots in space
[3:31:17] <FlyguyJP> They do have a mission later that gives a good reason
[3:31:18] <tattleworm> there's an explanation coming, don't worry
[3:31:20] <%JamesCorck> The third novel was the last one written by Karpyshyn.
[3:31:21] <BurdRightsActivist> @JamesCorck The Cereal novel?
[3:31:21] <%X2Eliah> welllll kinda
[3:31:23] <guiltyboya> Playing aliens? Not on Cerberus's watch Kappa
[3:31:23] <PaperyHornet1013> its fucked up
[3:31:24] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Cerberus becoming a military superpower in 6 months is one of the most nonsensical parts
[3:31:24] <James_Quivers> Was that 150 'people' or 150 'cells'?
[3:31:25] <+jojo_abob> yeah they do its spoilers tho
[3:31:25] <kikoeru_san> fucking when
[3:31:25] <mr_saturday93> No spoilers chat
[3:31:25] <Gruhunchously> I would argue it's not a very good explanation
[3:31:25] <Latija> there's more cerberus grunts than people in the alliance military
[3:31:27] <%warpath1911> theyre slave clone babies
[3:31:28] <%peachy996> They will and it's dumb
[3:31:28] <@Ranryu692> it's not the best explanation, but they do explain it
[3:31:28] <%JamesCorck> Kai Leng is a bitch in Novel 3.
[3:31:28] <Marpolo13> lol
[3:31:28] <terrible35> they have ways
[3:31:29] <PaperyHornet1013> do you want to hear it?
[3:31:29] <%JamesCorck> No.
[3:31:30] <%X2Eliah> they kinda explain it
[3:31:30] <%akscully> they do later in the game
[3:31:30] <+dd44dostivei> reapers
[3:31:30] <mattynezz> Yeah, don't worry
[3:31:31] <%walternatorz> they use linkedin
[3:31:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:32] <mr_saturday93> they do explain
[3:31:32] <Sp3ctre48> There is an explanation but I still don't like it
[3:31:32] <DatAsuna> The increase from 2 to 3 is more justified than from 1 to 2. lol
[3:31:32] <%xcompleasedad> you are NOT WRONG to disbelieve
[3:31:32] <TheAntiNihilist> kidnapping Humans probably
[3:31:34] <%coward_man> it's a bad explanation but it is real
[3:31:35] <%Solid_Stro> 👁 👄 👁
[3:31:35] <%JamesCorck> The cereal novel was the fourth one.
[3:31:36] <kikoeru_san> NOVELS DONT COUNT
[3:31:37] <dekkitout> Lemmes guess, clones
[3:31:37] <%Conscript_Gary> There is an explanation. Never said it was a great one.
[3:31:38] <%X2Eliah> you may not like the explanation
[3:31:38] <Aiutare47> Ok.
[3:31:38] <GustauveVIII> theres explanations
[3:31:39] <Virokwet> we'll see
[3:31:41] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt One of the most prominent long essay criticisms focuses on how ABSURD the logistics of ME3 Cerberus are.
[3:31:41] <+Goraka91> @andrewofbob Ah oops, I thought we were done with all the main ones and doing DLC
[3:31:41] <knight_verse> The mission on Bening.....
[3:31:41] <Ids560> I think they should have explained how they had the resources to literally bring a person back from reentry
[3:31:44] <DatAsuna> It's very late in the game till they explain it
[3:31:45] <FlyguyJP> Can't spoil but they do have some good reason why they are flooded with manpower
[3:31:46] <+ryuguitarfreak> They do explain it
[3:31:46] <Dhrall> They got a big order discount from Kamino
[3:31:46] <%Retinolgaming> isn't it Miranda's mission?
[3:31:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> They do and its dumb
[3:31:47] <%peachy996> yeah well what do you want? lol
[3:31:49] <SirDicksalotII> Pats eye alway been messing up like that?
[3:31:51] <godila2> chat dont tell hi what it is
[3:31:52] <%faintsmile> not saying its a GOOD explanation.....
[3:31:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Commander Shepard saving humanity with you is a big boost to recruitment
[3:31:54] <%warpath1911> Where do they explain it?
[3:31:54] <%stantheman_97> i assumed mass kidnapping then forced indoctrination
[3:31:54] <%SWFanatic> rat a tat tat
[3:31:57] <DatAsuna> Though you could guess it now
[3:31:58] <Aiutare47> An explanation is given at the end.
[3:32:00] <blue8moon> just because it's an explanation doesn't mean it's a good one
[3:32:04] <zhenthrim213> DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA
[3:32:05] <+trackles_64> F
[3:32:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Star Wars answer. They're all clones of Jango Fett.
[3:32:08] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Its mega spoilers so we cant say it
[3:32:17] <TheAntiNihilist> HUMANS are da REAL MONSTERS
[3:32:18] <+ryuguitarfreak> It's on a mission in one of the multiplayer maps IIRC
[3:32:19] <%JamesCorck> @JamesCorck No, the Cereal novel was the fourth novel.
[3:32:24] <kikoeru_san> If the world ran on that logic, of novel make up for plot holes, than Char's Counterattack would be gold
[3:32:27] <$lotharrio> Run ruined. Restart from new game.
[3:32:28] <DatAsuna> You can totally guess the reason now, but they say it late in the game outright
[3:32:29] <PaperyHornet1013> do you want the explanation?
[3:32:31] <FlyguyJP> Have so many troops is not unbelievable but them being EVERYWHERE sure is unbelievable
[3:32:35] <DSD24> There we go
[3:32:37] <mattynezz> It will now be in your logs FOREVER
[3:32:38] <+trackles_64> Go blussy  adjutant go
[3:32:40] <Javier9563> it's a really stupid explanation and it doesn't make sense if you think about it for more than 5 minutes, but it's there
[3:32:47] <+trackles_64> Deadspace
[3:32:47] <+ryuguitarfreak> it's kinda late in the game yeah
[3:32:48] <%MidnightBurst12> that was dumb
[3:32:49] <triangularblasphemy> Why did we make these testicle golems
[3:32:50] <SaltyAzteca> What?
[3:32:52] <%Dakuu75> hm...
[3:32:52] <%Scevda> Qst log forever incomplete
[3:32:53] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Look at plot armor
[3:32:54] <SeruraRenge> I forgot this part was even in the dlc
[3:32:56] <%andrewofbob> @Goraka91 Main plot progress is we essentially kidnapped our waifu and are procrastinating on the geth dreadnaught
[3:32:56] <studleydoorite> Adjutussy
[3:32:56] <%stantheman_97> but it would probably be better with robots as their soldiers
[3:32:57] <%peachy996> Aren't Adjutants not reaper made?
[3:32:58] <%xcompleasedad> Yes
[3:32:59] <%DoubleRrico> the kracken from evolve?!
[3:32:59] <%warpath1911> yes
[3:32:59] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[3:33:00] <+Goraka91> No they're super scary though!
[3:33:01] <%X2Eliah> naaaaaaaw LUL
[3:33:02] <+trackles_64> Yes
[3:33:02] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Lmao
[3:33:04] <%faintsmile> its fine
[3:33:05] <zhenthrim213> A WHOLE SQAUD OF SOLDIERS
[3:33:05] <+JustToWatch> probably
[3:33:06] <terrible35> no LUL
[3:33:07] <knight_verse> @stantheman_97 That's literally what it is, literally the mission on Bening.
[3:33:09] <godila2> LUL
[3:33:10] <%watts121> Like I said, it would make more sense if Cerberus in ME3 was really and entire Alliance Fleet that was indoctrinated, the fact that they are just using civilians is also crazy, no wonder they suck.
[3:33:11] <%SWFanatic> meh
[3:33:12] <%Conscript_Gary> Good ol' Dead Space Exposition Window
[3:33:12] <Srthunda> why was their aim so bad
[3:33:15] <SkinnyRite> nah, remember they tried that with Jack
[3:33:16] <$lotharrio> It's fine owo
[3:33:16] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> No, but aren't you a-scared tho Pat?
[3:33:17] <%Mattais88> yep, but then you wouldn't have the shock of new unit
[3:33:18] <Aoworth> No it's super spooky shut up tho
[3:33:19] <blue8moon> look pat you're just too strong, clearly it's a you problem
[3:33:21] <+Goraka91> @andrewofbob Ah
[3:33:23] <%warpath1911> 3 people is a squad
[3:33:25] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Yeah, it just makes cereburus look even worse.
[3:33:27] <digaogrunge> you died in that sequece tho
[3:33:29] <MrPandastic> Shut up Pat, that makes too much sense.
[3:33:29] <%Scevda> Most players arent level 55 pat
[3:33:31] <PaperyHornet1013> I'm about to ADJUST that adjussy
[3:33:32] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, but you're super sayiaN7 Shepard Pat
[3:33:35] <Sp3ctre48> It's the scale of it for me, they go from a small terrorist group to invading council homeworlds, the citadel itself, having endless troops and resources, ect. I know why they have those things, but it gets ridiculous after a while
[3:33:35] <studleydoorite> the first one was literally a pile of ashes burnt through the ground within seconds of you encountering it
[3:33:38] <FlyguyJP> The point is all the non-plot armored character are fucked
[3:33:39] <%Scevda> With all upgrades
[3:33:48] <+trackles_64> Halo
[3:33:48] <%watts121> most players are
[3:33:54] <SaltyAzteca> Whyd they play the 3rd one first then LUL
[3:33:54] <%watts121> this DLC was not hard
[3:33:56] <PaperyHornet1013> with max guns
[3:33:57] <DatAsuna> this next cutscene actually reuses Mo-cap from the swtor mmo lol
[3:33:58] <%warpath1911> here comes more stupid
[3:33:58] <%X2Eliah> WHAT MORON PLAYS ME3 WITHOU 1 OR AT LEAST 2??
[3:34:00] <%watts121> none of them were
[3:34:04] <digaogrunge> and pissed money
[3:34:04] <%watts121> Citadel was kinda
[3:34:05] <%Monkeyweed21> with infinite money
[3:34:05] <+trackles_64> Bio terror
[3:34:05] <tattleworm> most players didn't cheatengine enough credits to get every upgrade
[3:34:07] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Yeah what the hell almost everyone is
[3:34:09] <blue8moon> I mean, this is dlc that came out after the main game, I would think most people would be high level LUL
[3:34:10] <FlyguyJP> Also come on Cerberus. Can you NOT be the worst for FIVE MINUTES
[3:34:13] <mattynezz> But Pat, this is the BEST place to jump into the series LUL
[3:34:15] <BurdRightsActivist> BIO FREAKS
[3:34:16] <+ryuguitarfreak> Cerberus really go back on being the ME1 stupid guys you me there
[3:34:18] <DSD24> 300 percent huh
[3:34:19] <%watts121> @tattleworm ok that's a thing
[3:34:20] <Gruhunchously> Cerberus is a Mary Sue organization. There I said it.
[3:34:24] <DatAsuna> keep your eyes open
[3:34:26] <%watts121> but hey...PAT CHEATS
[3:34:26] <%DoubleRrico> look with your special eyes
[3:34:26] <%warpath1911> this is fucking stupid
[3:34:28] <%peachy996> It is
[3:34:28] <Aoworth> Gonna look at it SUPER hard with those eyes
[3:34:28] <DSD24> God this all Cerberus
[3:34:29] <%VictorVonLouche> With that 100:100 vision
[3:34:30] <greene411> LOOK AT IT WITH MY HUGE EYES
[3:34:30] <DSD24> does
[3:34:30] <TheAntiNihilist> Shepard is SO SHOCKED
[3:34:30] <zhenthrim213> Bio EYES
[3:34:31] <%Scevda> Pat you dont recall the amount of emphasis by ea to say its okay to start with #3.
[3:34:32] <knight_verse> Most players didn't hack in infinite money and unlock all of the weapons and upgrades in one fell swoop at the beginning of the game.
[3:34:32] <%andrewofbob> Fun thing with doing  NG ME3 playthrough you have little money and xp to work with
[3:34:32] <+fetrigon> wtf are his eyes
[3:34:33] <GustauveVIII> 100/20 vision gogogogo
[3:34:34] <%peachy996> Especiall in 3
[3:34:34] <Ids560> @Gruhunchously very true
[3:34:35] <%Daxalog> 0_0
[3:34:35] <+ryuguitarfreak> I really liked TIM...
[3:34:36] <+Goraka91> Okay but why
[3:34:36] <FlyguyJP> SPECIAL EYES
[3:34:36] <mak0t0yukii> His eyes LUL
[3:34:37] <triangularblasphemy> Why
[3:34:38] <%Scevda> Therefore level 1.
[3:34:38] <SkinnyRite> MY BRAND
[3:34:39] <Sp3ctre48> Cerberus is way too incompetent to be mary sues
[3:34:43] <%SpoonheadInExile> BOY this version sure is LEGENDARY with the fucking disappearing EYELIDS
[3:34:45] <triangularblasphemy> What
[3:34:45] <godila2> @X2Eliah "mass effect 3 the best place to start"
[3:34:47] <JetpackMcQuack> That sure was content
[3:34:48] <triangularblasphemy> What about rejection
[3:34:49] <mak0t0yukii> HIS SPECIAL EYES LUL
[3:34:54] <BurdRightsActivist> With the star forge, we are now operating at 300%
[3:34:57] <%Solid_Stro> Cerberus is bad, I don’t know if you realize this…
[3:34:58] <%HRDSalami654> Cerberus are the republicans of Mass Effect.
[3:35:01] <terrible35> I see it ALL
[3:35:01] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> Ive never played ME but are you eyes supposed to look like that?
[3:35:06] <DSD24> 300 Percent
[3:35:06] <%HairballCT> 👁️ 👄 👁️
[3:35:07] <%peachy996> In 3 all the important figures in Cereberus are incredibl stupid but the writers want you to think they're cool/smart
[3:35:07] <%HRDSalami654> They have one move, and that is converting people.
[3:35:07] <%Tarage> This guy is so boring sounding
[3:35:13] <+trackles_64> After building shephard
[3:35:16] <James_Quivers> @HRDSalami654 ?
[3:35:17] <triangularblasphemy> NO THEY MADE THEM
[3:35:17] <+Goraka91> Sounds like a job for Terra-Save
[3:35:18] <Sp3ctre48> These dumb science experiments have gone wrong literally every single time
[3:35:18] <%peachy996> So Kai Leng is so cool and Oleg is so smart
[3:35:21] <knight_verse> Clearly a smart idea to experiment and create reapers
[3:35:21] <%Monkeyweed21> and it got out and started killing them\
[3:35:23] <HyperionXV> Cerberus are plannigg to weaponize space zomibes
[3:35:24] <%Tarage> Yes.
[3:35:25] <Gruhunchously> @Sp3ctre48 And yet they still manage to get the better of the entire rest of the galaxy
[3:35:25] <%SWFanatic> none of this matters
[3:35:25] <SkinnyRite> PatShep all like 👀 "HMMMMM"
[3:35:26] <%Dakuu75> The word "Cerberus" is sounding less and less cool, by the minute
[3:35:29] <%warpath1911> yes
[3:35:29] <DSD24> It super is
[3:35:30] <+ryuguitarfreak> They fucked up Cerberus in 3
[3:35:30] <%SpoonheadInExile> Yes
[3:35:30] <%PhantomMiG> Yes
[3:35:30] <%Scevda> Again!
[3:35:33] <+FoolsArcade> they're adjutated
[3:35:34] <DatAsuna> cerberus does dumb experiements forever
[3:35:35] <+BossPlayerOG> its a terrible name
[3:35:35] <intestinal_bleeding> it's not a good name, it's too close to "agitate"
[3:35:36] <+Extrallent> Didn't they MAKE the adjutants?  of course they would experiment on them
[3:35:36] <glimzemal> it's bad
[3:35:37] <TheAntiNihilist> yeah...
[3:35:37] <MrPandastic> Cerberus is pulling an Umbrella move here.
[3:35:37] <zhenthrim213> yea
[3:35:37] <$lotharrio> Cerberus does nothing but invent monsters and then die to them.
[3:35:37] <Dova573> Total galatic Saturation?
[3:35:39] <%AmericanSkidd> doesnt really roll off the tounge
[3:35:39] <Profmcstevie> "The Unpleasant"
[3:35:40] <%X2Eliah> eh its a sci fi m0nster sounding nam
[3:35:40] <BurdRightsActivist> No. :)
[3:35:43] <%Mattais88> I awlwats though it was dsupposed to be adjunct
[3:35:44] <DSD24> Why can't be be Ravager or Beast Mode
[3:35:45] <dekkitout> Elaborate
[3:35:49] <DatAsuna> not as bizarre as sovereign/harbinger having each other's names
[3:35:52] <%SWFanatic> its because this whole dlc is adjacent to the rest of the game
[3:35:53] <intestinal_bleeding> and it doesn't really emphasize or explain what they are which is a bunch of goo mutants
[3:35:54] <mattynezz> Fits the Collector name style more
[3:35:58] <%DeadRuins> blind
[3:36:01] <%coward_man> it's meant to be "mysterious" ooooo spooky scary monstars
[3:36:01] <%peachy996> Husks took all the cool name
[3:36:02] <+trackles_64> Geefy
[3:36:03] <%Tarage> PUPPER
[3:36:03] <intestinal_bleeding> I'd take like Abominant or Imperfect or whatever
[3:36:05] <%Scevda> I think of Adjutant in StarCraft
[3:36:06] <SaltyAzteca> DUDE
[3:36:06] <%watts121> I have a feeling they wanted to call them Servitors but GW would sue.
[3:36:06] <%Dakuu75> lol wtf
[3:36:06] <Aoworth> LUL
[3:36:09] <mattynezz> Maybe they were originally Collector enemies
[3:36:09] <digaogrunge> BLIND
[3:36:09] <Sp3ctre48> That poor man
[3:36:12] <+Goraka91> ''A military officer who acts as an administrative assistant to a senior officer'' Huh weird
[3:36:13] <%Garthunox> @DSD24 Ravager is a name for an enemy in game already
[3:36:13] <zhenthrim213> LOL
[3:36:20] <@Ranryu692> Atlas drops look super cool
[3:36:22] <Javier9563> charge that robot ass
[3:36:22] <SkinnyRite> uh Pat
[3:36:23] <+trackles_64> How do yo even hijack altasses?
[3:36:28] <%watts121> IT IS
[3:36:28] <godila2> wow that look out scream was so LUL
[3:36:32] <%walternatorz> I wonder if they had a trade mark on the name and hadn't used it till now
[3:36:32] <%peachy996> Husks and Collectors took all the cool names like Abomination, Marauder, Ravager, Brute and Praetorian
[3:36:33] <%watts121> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE!
[3:36:34] <+trackles_64> O nez mode
[3:36:34] <%Ipsenscastle> I think they're named 'adjutant' because they were supposed to be essentially Cerberus slaves
[3:36:35] <mak0t0yukii> RAAAAH RAAAH
[3:36:36] <%AllenDeadman> it is
[3:36:37] <BurdRightsActivist> UNGA BUNGA

[3:39:05] <%Scevda> @thelocalrival a vanguard run is the most worthwhile second play throughclass
[3:39:06] <triangularblasphemy> It was named for him
[3:39:07] <SaltyAzteca> Unless they mean this room
[3:39:08] <%JamesCorck> Pat thgat's the entrance to Mordin's clininc.

[3:39:27] <%JamesCorck> That alley was Mordin's old clinic.
[3:39:28] <%watts121> it's not like Mordin's clinic was distingushible
[3:39:35] <%JamesCorck> The entrance to it, at least.

[3:46:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> I'm glad he created this device specifically in the middle of the room that she couldn't get trapped in unless she specifically tried running straight at him
[3:46:02] <triangularblasphemy> YOUR FUTURE ARMY CAN'T OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY OR CLAIM TERRITORY
[3:46:04] <James_Quivers> She hit the biotic charge button prematurely

[3:46:19] <Sp3ctre48> Is there an option to maybe....not release her Keepo
[3:46:19] <%JoshManVGH> Is this DLC indicative of what the original ending of ME3 was like?

[3:46:56] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre working together? alright
[3:46:59] <BurdRightsActivist> The only way that trap could've been worse was if it was a pit of crocodiles LUL
[3:47:03] <blackjack8182> F
[3:47:04] <%X2Eliah> ok you got it
[3:47:05] <Marpolo13> but do we HAVE to
[3:47:05] <+Goraka91> Swan dived right into that trap
[3:47:07] <PaperyHornet1013> BLUSSY
[3:47:11] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> aria got hit with the big dumb
[3:47:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> That applies to so many different Arias
[3:47:12] <+BigBruthaThunda> yep
[3:47:12] <%Solid_Stro> Thanks for telling us what to do smarty tactician man
[3:47:13] <Gruhunchously> I wrote a fanfic about Aria and I swear it was better than this
[3:47:14] <+FingaLights> No guyyyysss, She was blinded with rage.... Don't you get it
[3:47:19] <%watts121> but seriously tho, how was she suppose to know that he would create a trap for that one spot?
[3:47:19] <BurdRightsActivist> WE COULD'VE HAD TUSSY
[3:47:24] <Sp3ctre48> I can believe it
[3:47:28] <@Ranryu692> oh yeah, this fight sucks
[3:47:29] <%Conscript_Gary> Imagine if there was an alternate ending for just letting her die
[3:47:29] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I like this DLC but I won't lie she was being very stupid here
[3:47:29] <%faintsmile> this dlc made her so dumb
[3:47:31] <triangularblasphemy> @PatStaresAt Jack is significantly better than Aria
[3:47:34] <spongeofmystery> Nice counter
[3:47:35] <+dd44dostivei> @Gruhunchously lol
[3:47:36] <Foopoof> her anger blinded her
[3:47:43] <Foopoof> and made her really dumb
[3:47:52] <+Goraka91> Uh huh
[3:47:53] <Shade075> @Pookiedaexzile LUL
[3:47:55] <Sp3ctre48> I can feel Pat spamming that charge button
[3:47:57] <DSD24> Aria has been silly this entire DLC
[3:47:59] <%peachy996> This is a mess
[3:48:01] <Ekaelis> She was pretty dumb in this dlc to begin with
[3:48:05] <triangularblasphemy> The Aria of ME2 would have just drawn a pistol and shot him in the head
[3:48:08] <joodatious> she's like jotaro
[3:48:11] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no...
[3:48:12] <SiriusLeeLost> Girl was grief stricken...you'd do the same if anyone harmed Elmo or Zang!
[3:48:13] <%faintsmile> let her die LUL
[3:48:14] <Marpolo13> cry i gues

[3:48:21] <+Goraka91> BabyRage Omega's mine!

[3:48:22] <%hereiam407> I walked my dog, and this is STILL GOING ON!?
[3:48:25] <%barrakuta371> shoot her
[3:48:26] <%bravebravesrobin> Aria wanted to give you a boss battle...
[3:48:31] <%Solid_Stro> Aria just grunting in the background
[3:48:32] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Man is that the script?
[3:48:35] <KnightOfTrousers> You don't maintain complete control of a huge station for hundreds of years by getting blinded with anger. This is dumb -.-
[3:48:38] <SaltyAzteca> This is a real slide whistle moment
[3:48:39] <%peachy996> We're almost free
[3:48:46] <%unhuggable1> this shit is so hard on insanity
[3:48:46] <%coward_man> let her feel cool while she chews them crayons
[3:48:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I’m assuming citadel hasn’t been done yet
[3:48:55] <Gruhunchously> Aria, I said I was going to help you and all, but sometimes you just have to let natural evolution take it's course
[3:48:55] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt So yeah, this is probably the 1st real low point of ME3
[3:48:56] <%Conscript_Gary> She talks a lot of shit for a helpless person
[3:49:00] <Sp3ctre48> nah
[3:49:21] <%Solid_Stro> We’re almost done, I can see it
[3:49:22] <joodatious> @X2Eliah its a good thing we started with easily the worst dlc
[3:49:22] <+Goraka91> God Aria is so cool
[3:49:25] <KnightOfTrousers> Having a huge goopy weakpoint seems like a design flaw...
[3:49:27] <+FingaLights> Think if popping a pimple on your back killed you
[3:49:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> C-C-C-COMBO
[3:49:43] <+TheBigO75> why play anything but vanguard
[3:49:45] <Sp3ctre48> People usually save Citadel until right before the last mission
[3:49:51] <%SWFanatic> lots of enemies have weak spots that you can destroy
[3:49:56] <SaltyAzteca> WHOOOO?

[4:01:31] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I'd save it for yourself, what you said what happened for Shadowbringers seems like it's not worth it

[4:03:49] <Badgerconda_> Pat why are you talking in freedom units
[4:03:57] <MarylandJutsu> Not YET
[4:03:57] <%Garthunox> cheer500 ok no seriously, if you stream it you'll run into the same problem as ShB, everyone will be playing it or not caught up so they'll not show up, and you'll be streaming it for like 2 weeks so you'll be far behind everyone, i'd much rather you play it on your own time and enjoy it more and not have to worry about that shit, but thats just my opinion
[4:04:08] <mystfield327> hi pat
