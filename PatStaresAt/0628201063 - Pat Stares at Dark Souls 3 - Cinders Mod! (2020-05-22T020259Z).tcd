[0:11:59] <Zombrocom> That's the gargoyle flame hammer
[0:12:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Maybe the barrage and attacking with sword so they have a hard time keeping up the shield?
[0:12:04] <huskarl_zap> We only talk about Astolfo in this chat
[0:12:06] <%SmoothEnigma> So Cinders is definitely broken in the best way possible. I just facefucked the Pontiff with Solaire and my multiple buff spells on my magic infused moonlight greatsword +8. NUMBER GET BIG!
[0:12:12] <j0ustar> "fight"
[0:12:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It would probably work better if you attacked him while it was still blasting him

[0:14:11] <+NitronStreams> make one area shitty so the rest seems better by comparison
[0:14:11] <%LaughingCatt> nothing gonna beat the Valley of Defilement
[0:14:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Miyazaki had a very traumatic experience with the poison swamp from Dragon Quest when he was young
[0:14:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I remember making new characters to screw with noobs and I'd come here to get literal poop weapons to smear on them
[0:14:18] <%Ner234> That place was a FUCK
[0:14:18] <%DJTanaka> @whitemage4life A person of culture I see.
[0:14:19] <%YakumoYomi> Wouldn't the Heretic Staff be better for Pat's dark spells? I could have sworn certain catalysts got a bonus to dark spells (or maybe the other catalysts have a penalty?).
[0:14:21] <GameOver_Here> Blightown of Valley of Def?
[0:14:23] <corncob333> can you get the water walk ring in this mod?
[0:14:25] <+ALazo> Dark Souls series is the quest to perfect poison swamps

[0:14:57] <%버빌리열한번째발가락> one guy is always truthful
[0:14:57] <%ssjklyco> Like how Pat is good at video games
[0:14:57] <PunishedMercer_> real or not, that's an understandable.
[0:14:57] <%maenos2> used to spend summers at a beach house that backed to a marshy swamp and jesus h christ was that place hell
[0:14:59] <catpurrnipuss> What NG is this?
[0:15:00] <ShichiNoBushi> I hated the poisonous swamps in DQ/DW around that age, too.
[0:15:02] <tiaramaki> You think someone would do that? Go in a stream chat and tell lies? Kappa
[0:15:03] <Hazard_Kujacker> I dont remember Valley of Defilement being as awful as Blighttown
[0:15:06] <j0ustar> who would lie on the internet?
[0:15:07] <%BubbaRands> No one lies on the internet 4Head
[0:15:09] <CheekyBirb> that's why you gotta kappa
[0:15:10] <Ultimatefool> Miyazaki also got attacked by Skeleton Balls as a child
[0:15:14] <+NitronStreams> now to spread it to every gaming new site
[0:15:17] <Azathotic> Miyazaki got the idea for Ornstein and Smough from Bad Boys II
[0:15:20] <%YakumoYomi> @Valentinius_Anodyne You were way too convincing.

[0:15:41] <%Ranryu692> Witcher 3 is like 12 bucks on Steam right now for its 5 year anniversary

[0:16:10] <%TheWinged7> yeah that was in the base game
[0:16:10] <$shadow1man9> He was there in the OG
[0:16:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Floridian swamps are the worst kind of hell, they have alligators, carnivorous fish, crabs, and saw grass in them, AND fire ants float on water so entire nests of hundreds of ants can just float over and climb onto you
[0:16:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Blightown is terrible but that's less on the swamp and way more on those toxic dart assholes
[0:16:16] <+hoenhime344> Miyazaki had a brief Relationship with a Girl named Yuria who claimed to bne a witch
[0:16:17] <Zombrocom> Londor tincture is real good for this area

[0:23:55] <%DappercatEsquire> I'm glad you're glad
[0:23:56] <%heartlesshealer> right through the hat, ouch
[0:23:57] <%daemonazaezal> Bye 40k
[0:24:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good job you're even better than I am at this game
[0:24:10] <+headphonesandhandgrenades> FlipThis
[0:24:12] <%weissguard> Oh god, stream froze for me when Pat had his tongue out like an ahegao face. LUL (Stream's fine now though.)
[0:24:14] <%YakumoYomi> No worries. He can just grind bosses to get those souls back.
[0:24:15] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PatStaresAt why did you do that pat?
[0:24:18] <%daemonazaezal> this means hes gonna grind off stream more
[0:24:33] <%daemonazaezal> why not run
[0:24:43] <Aydarkzero> cirse monkaS
[0:24:44] <+oda_flobunaga> DS 1 levels of curse
[0:24:51] <Monkeyweed21> its the same as vanilla Pat
[0:24:57] <%templar010> !CURSED!
[0:25:11] <%Fooguwu> Ring of Get Poisoned For Longer
[0:25:13] <JonEWorldbeater> Hi chat. Good to catch the stream without sitting through 6 hours of rambling bullshit. Hope it doesn't end in the next 2 minutes.
[0:25:14] <%starotter70> When is Pat going to start selling his Doujinshis?
[0:25:15] <%DensityD> hey guys, is he Dark or is he magic?
[0:25:20] <%TheStarbecue> i like how the flick of your guys wrist is all like "bitch" when he casts
[0:25:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Poop Spear Get
[0:25:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> does having more resist mean the poison you do get lasts longer?
[0:25:35] <%heartlesshealer> did you read the poison bit ring, pat?
[0:25:39] <jdanov> @PatStaresAt do you have the Poisoncap helmet? has like 250 poison res
[0:25:41] <Aydarkzero> yes
[0:25:45] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[0:25:45] <%king_wragles> @DensityD Dark
[0:25:49] <%WhereIsWill> deep dart seems good for the speed
[0:25:51] <+Erimos> no
[0:25:52] <%king_wragles> AND just a bit of magic
[0:25:54] <+itsOnyxLeo> He was grinding off screen?
[0:25:58] <%DensityD> Jebaited
[0:25:59] <%Valdorick> No, the bar is bigger is all.
[0:26:00] <ShichiNoBushi> The meter's bigger, and it doesn't slow how fast it goes away.
[0:26:02] <%Valdorick> Its time based.
[0:26:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Poison was a well thought out mechanic
[0:26:15] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt try that mushroom bug hat thing? It has poison resist I think?
[0:26:20] <ShichiNoBushi> I guess I'm wrong?
[0:26:22] <+oda_flobunaga> isn't there that anti-poison facemask by the start?
[0:26:24] <Monkeyweed21> Status resistance in Dark Souls is mostly used for countering PvP builds
[0:26:24] <%heartlesshealer> same rate of poison gain, but bigger poison bar to fill
[0:26:37] <%Nikopol1717> Goat Jesusi
[0:26:46] <%Valdorick> OH NO
[0:26:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Poison was terrible in PvP. It was only good in 2
[0:26:55] <%DensityD> ???
[0:27:00] <+Erimos> It's over, Heysel! I have the high ground!
[0:27:03] <%starotter70> Good job Hazel
[0:27:05] <snoozeaholic> clever girl

[0:39:34] <%heartlesshealer> big HMMMMMM
[0:39:38] <%FacetiousAF> chat is damage scaling any different in the mod?
[0:39:40] <%PsideFxX> psaBig psaWrong
[0:39:46] <Scrub_Seeker> its not showing up because you're already dark infused
[0:39:50] <%xcompleasedad> psa1guy
[0:39:51] <Zombrocom> Because your int is higher than faith
[0:39:52] <%heartlesshealer> ^
[0:39:55] <%WhereIsWill> sounds like psaBig math time
[0:40:03] <Monkeyweed21> You lose Massive dark damage
[0:40:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FacetiousAF on weapons, not sure. no soft cap on level up stats I think.
[0:40:13] <%Fooguwu> drag out the math goblin!
[0:40:18] <+Lost_Zombie> @PatStaresAt Think you can also hybrid infuse to change cast types on these weapons if I'm reading wiki right. So you could change heysel pick to something else. If I'm right
[0:40:27] <%JD_Lars> Feed the goblin
[0:40:29] <Monkeyweed21> its like 300 damage for like 10 spell buff
[0:40:35] <%WhereIsWill> oops all basilisks
[0:40:44] <Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Hello my good sir
[0:40:48] <%TheDullaMAN> You need a faster moving spell.
[0:40:52] <+StrawberryLion> Look at these vape chameleons
[0:40:52] <%xcompleasedad> I rescind my psa1guy
[0:40:55] <+Erimos> Return the slab, or suffer my curse!
[0:41:05] <%FacetiousAF> beware the vape geckos
[0:41:13] <%WhereIsWill> dart should replace that crap turret LUL
[0:41:15] <%ssjklyco> What do you call a bee with a wand? A spelling bee
[0:41:19] <LSpiral> I'm pretty sure you also lose dark spell damage due to how hybrid infusion works, pat, if you change infusion type to anything but dark
[0:41:19] <%TheREALGirthMan> It's time to trudge through the slimeo poop juice
[0:41:22] <%slaughtedlamb> hey pat, just want to say thanks for showing such a great mod, too bad there are no steam keys for it at humble bundle yet
[0:41:36] <+encrouched> They call me Darkeater Midriff
[0:41:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Balanced range
[0:41:55] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> wait candle viable???
[0:42:14] <%TheREALGirthMan> Many garbo boys are viable now with this mod
[0:42:22] <+OwlLightningMage> They should just lock you on to SoC from here when you press the button
[0:42:25] <SMuffinMan> I still think even vanilla DS3 is the best in the series. DEM BOSSES sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[0:42:28] <%TheREALGirthMan> Lots of big buffs
[0:42:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Candle not only viable but kinda busted in a good way
[0:42:31] <%Billyuppercut0> This mod makes everything good
[0:42:37] <%WhereIsWill> I wanna do lightning fist
[0:42:38] <%KishinGrek> This mod is amazing
[0:42:42] <Scrub_Seeker> just consider, you're doing 1000 dark damage and you haven't even ascended the candlestick yet
[0:42:55] <+OwlLightningMage> It's a shame most of the DLC bosses for 3 are garbage
[0:42:58] <%TheREALGirthMan> The bonk stick
[0:43:02] <%DensityD> but lets see what Hazel thinks
[0:43:06] <%edwardskacz> I'm playing a dex/luck katana build I love this mod
[0:43:08] <DXLelouch24> You can go do combo with fists
[0:43:11] <SMuffinMan> Nope all good
[0:43:12] <%FacetiousAF> three rounds of friede sucked
[0:43:24] <+BurkeBigsby> So this mod enables fun for all?
[0:43:25] <cgreene64> Why don't you try infusing Heysel's weapon as enchanted and use it as your secondary?
[0:43:25] <DXLelouch24> I think theres a hadoken spell too
[0:43:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gods Above, just imagine how much damage Pat will be doing once he ascends the candle
[0:43:39] <+LumberjackJack> I don't think your hat is big enough.
[0:43:41] <+OwlLightningMage> @facetiousaf you get it
[0:43:44] <%KishinGrek> Is boss behavior changed in this mod?
[0:43:48] <%TheREALGirthMan> Looks more like a slab of metal to me tbh
[0:43:52] <+Soulsbjorne> that where Guts died
[0:43:54] <%spiritofmojave> Put your grasses on
[0:43:58] <%WhereIsWill> that's what she said psaSmug
[0:44:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Let's not forget everyone's favorite boss guy with a big doggo

[0:44:16] <%gespenst25> That just looks like a zweihander with extra steps.
[0:44:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @KishinGrek At least some bosses are, not sure for all though
[0:44:24] <Kingdom_65> PatStaresAtWithABigHat
[0:44:25] <%WhereIsWill> ringed city was dope

[0:44:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @KishinGrek Also you can refight bosses, so that's cool
[0:44:52] <milleniumfalcon69> ring city was hype as fuck with dual GS
[0:44:55] <Monkeyweed21> This swamp is what happens when Guts eats the Booty like Groceries on Slan
[0:45:03] <%dekkitout> That 20% reduced sodium estus soup
[0:45:07] <Kingdom_65> Sorry for being that guy but, what's the major changes for this mod?
[0:45:14] <+OwlLightningMage> @facetiousaf You saved yourself a headache. The only good thing about it was the weapons and final boss

[0:45:19] <%starotter70> I can't believe they targeted you Pat
[0:45:21] <%TheREALGirthMan> Lots of balance changes with equipment/weapons
[0:45:24] <Scrub_Seeker> @Kingdom_65 a shitton, you can read about em on the wiki
[0:45:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wasn't Slan made of monster intestines when she talked to Guts
[0:45:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> They added buffs to almost everything I think and bosses can be refought

[0:47:14] <Scrub_Seeker> @PaladinDupre boo

[0:47:18] <Kingdom_65> Big Hat Pat Stares At
[0:47:20] <%FacetiousAF> ya know. it might be a horrific poison swamp, but i kinda dig the look of this place.
[0:47:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @PaladinDupre Hell yeah
[0:47:23] <%spiritofmojave> @paladindupre uuugh
[0:47:24] <+encrouched> Ghrusome
[0:47:32] <%KishinGrek> Played this game multiple times, did not once think of that
[0:47:38] <hunter239833> anybody ever try the ghru staff in low level pvp? Shit was cheesy as all hell but fun
[0:47:47] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> where does one acquire the large headress
[0:47:47] <%spiritofmojave> Ghroovy
[0:47:49] <%WhereIsWill> I can't believe pat has to traverse plagues backyard
[0:47:57] <%GohanHitsugaya> Agreed, it's shit.
[0:47:59] <%Ynkubus18> Some of us like misery
[0:47:59] <+Erimos> Miyazaki's summer home.
[0:47:59] <%patriotrenegade> Farron Swamp: the patented and obligatory "we gotta have a poisonous shithole level, right?"
[0:48:02] <Zombrocom> I guess that's kinda the point
[0:48:02] <+OwlLightningMage> It's not worse than the DLCs
[0:48:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's the best Dark Souls swamp though, at least
[0:48:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you learn to not like it once you're wandering around for an hour
[0:48:10] <initialdario> Just got here, did Pat find the rainbow phantom juice in Firelink?
[0:48:21] <%FacetiousAF> but they did a good job making it poop. like how Deep Nest in hollow knight is a nightmare, but they did a good job with it
[0:48:22] <+encrouched> I too am a swamp Ghrupie
[0:48:28] <+TheBitingIrish> I think the only things here that really bothered me were the berserker ghru and elder ghru
[0:48:34] <%Agami23> this area has a big lovecraftian feel to it for me.
[0:48:36] <+Erimos> @initialdario he did
[0:48:36] <%patriotrenegade> Thats just the Faintstone icon turned upsidedown!
[0:48:37] <+TopTieramisu> fromsoft has yet to do worse than frigid outskirts
[0:48:41] <hunter239833> The elder gru are needlessly strong
[0:48:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Abyss Watchers, aka best boss with adds in the series. Fuck O and S
[0:48:50] <+Soulsbjorne> i always just used dagger weapon art and it never bothered me really
[0:48:51] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Hey Pat, and maybe Paige if she's not dead, can you settle an argument for me? Does "smelling like a bed of roses" mean you smell good like roses or bad like fertilizer?
[0:48:52] <initialdario> @Erimos hell yeah i love that item
[0:48:55] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> are there any major changes to the bosses like in Daughters of Ash, or just stat balancing?
[0:48:59] <SMuffinMan> Only DLC boss that sucks in 3 is the Gravetender
[0:49:00] <%starotter70> Gotta love the Abyss Watchers
[0:49:01] <gluttonousmimic> To be honest, that Abyssal Edge is cool and all, but you're taking more damage than you should because of it.
[0:49:02] <Scrub_Seeker> some bosses @AsslessChapsVEVO
[0:49:04] <%patriotrenegade> The Elder Ghru are bananas strong
[0:49:11] <+Erimos> @initialdario perfect for meme compilations
[0:49:16] <%FacetiousAF> mask i would assume its the actual roses...
[0:49:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bed of roses is good. how is supposed to be fertilizer
[0:49:19] <%PaladinDupre> Pat you gotta take out the Ghru leader, find Ocelot.
[0:49:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how words good
[0:49:31] <SMuffinMan> Oh awesome!
[0:49:34] <%bluescreen1988> dey ficht it
[0:49:34] <%Fooguwu> hey pat im eating some bluebs' that came from quebec. they taste like orb!

[0:49:37] <+oda_flobunaga> Horse fuck valley is soo bad no sane players go there
[0:49:39] <+encrouched> I accidentally grabed the HP Lovecraft sauce instead, oh boyyyyyy
[0:49:39] <%patriotrenegade> with what, a giant frost crab? @PatStaresAt
[0:49:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There's a very cool boss it was replaced with, I believe

[0:51:42] <+Erimos> It's the least bad of all the swamps, but it's still boring to navigate.
[0:51:42] <aubrea> I think this is the worst area of any soulsborne game lol, at least I can't think of anything worse from 2
[0:51:48] <Kingdom_65> Can't wait for the Elden Ring swamp Kappa

[0:57:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, if only you had a boulder of some sort B)
[0:57:56] <+encrouched> Absolute badass corrupts absolutely
[0:57:58] <+twohitgood> @AsslessChapsVEVO firelink. ash cemetary is all a bonus area.
[0:58:00] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat solaire my dude
[0:58:00] <%patriotrenegade> if only u had a big sword
[0:58:00] <jhonxiolonn> Circle around it
[0:58:01] <%Laecerelius> Hea big boy
[0:58:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave is S tier and no one knows
[0:58:09] <%spiritofmojave> If only you had a large slab of iron
[0:58:15] <%DappercatEsquire> Oh, fog gate, no cheese
[0:58:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> they are paid off by the boulder lobby
[0:58:19] <%hycind53> Boulder Heave is the best fucking spell in the game
[0:58:21] <Gabbycat> @PaladinDupre extended edition? netflix only has the theatrical :<
[0:58:23] <+OwlLightningMage> People think I'm joking
[0:58:23] <%cureneckbeard> haha boulder go brrrrrrr
[0:58:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Dude, Boulder Heave was S tier in vanilla
[0:58:31] <+OwlLightningMage> EXACTLY
[0:58:36] <+Lost_Zombie> It does like 1400 damage with like 0-1 upgrades on flame
[0:58:36] <Scrub_Seeker> earth pyromancy is an archetype in cinders
[0:58:36] <%TheWinged7> patty the thrusts dangit
[0:58:41] <%TheWinged7> *parry
[0:58:43] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Bolder Heave is super busted, even for this mod standards
[0:58:44] <%RedPanda25> Can you infuse the torch with a fire gem? It would be hilarious if you can
[0:58:45] <ECRead> Boulder was pretty good good for a bit of time
[0:58:46] <initialdario> Pocket Solaire is so strong tho
[0:58:47] <jhonxiolonn> ROLL towards ut
[0:58:47] <%patriotrenegade> use dark against a boss corrupted by the dark
[0:58:50] <a_mad_dragon> is it not weak to fire anymore?
[0:58:50] <+Erimos> Boulder was always good, it's just not very flashy.
[0:58:56] <Zombrocom> He doesn't have a parry
[0:58:57] <initialdario> mod man gave him too many stats
[0:59:04] <+twohitgood> wht are thoe geysers
[0:59:04] <LSpiral> nah, he's still weak to fire
[0:59:05] <Aydarkzero> looks rad
[0:59:06] <+encrouched> Is that what dementia looks like
[0:59:06] <%WhereIsWill> slow an steady pat!
[0:59:07] <Chimeraelite> nah just enough stats
[0:59:08] <%starotter70> Yo
[0:59:11] <%YakumoYomi> Mines
[0:59:13] <%TheWinged7> humanity i would guess
[0:59:16] <%patriotrenegade> probably curse like with ds2 queen
[0:59:17] <Chimeraelite> Not supposed to be a first fight.
[0:59:24] <+OwlLightningMage> This boss looks really dumb now LUL
[0:59:25] <%TheREALGirthMan> Oh man it super is curse
[0:59:26] <%Ranryu692> if you keep pushing boulder, people are gonna start calling you Sisyphus
[0:59:27] <Aydarkzero> wow thats a lot of damage
[0:59:28] <SMuffinMan> Hoomanity
[0:59:28] <%PaladinDupre> @Gabbycat indeed, I stream a movie night every Saturday, rn were alternating LOTR with an ongoing retrospective on James Bond, this weekend is Live and Let Die
[0:59:34] <+OwlLightningMage> They gave him too much
[0:59:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> To be fair, it's not surprising that too many people don't know that Boulder Heave was good with how mediocre magic was in base game
[0:59:34] <%starotter70> Phew
[0:59:35] <Chimeraelite> I killed him right after fucking up the Skeleton boss with the fog n' shit
[0:59:40] <a_mad_dragon> t101Jiiii sus
[0:59:40] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt maybe theyre curse orbs like with Nashandra?
[0:59:41] <milleniumfalcon69> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[0:59:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Is this boss restored content or something?
[0:59:43] <%patriotrenegade> lol
[0:59:45] <%spiritofmojave> @ranryu692 Push eagle for summer slam
[0:59:47] <%QuadraticGravity> Catacombs
[0:59:48] <Zombrocom> Chaos Servent covenant
[0:59:52] <deefykins> Cornyx
[0:59:54] <%QuadraticGravity> Or the fire seed shop
[0:59:55] <%hycind53> Trade Fire Seeds to the pyromancy trainer
[0:59:57] <%TheDullaMAN> You can just buy demon souls.
[0:59:57] <+Lost_Zombie> Trade at coryx I think
[0:59:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you sold ratslayer?
[1:00:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can buy one from Cornyx
[1:00:01] <%Daisuke89> Could those things around the arena have the same effect as the thing with Seath? When you destroy he becomes vulnerable?
[1:00:04] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat choas covenant
[1:00:15] <Linconlord> Is this the mod he was talking about on the podcast?
[1:00:17] <Chimeraelite> Nope, just new content ment to fuck you up. Skips Gundyr phase 1 and buffs him with hp and damage I think
[1:00:22] <Chimeraelite> Yes @Linconlord
[1:00:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Linconlord Ye
[1:00:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Linconlord yeah
[1:00:23] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt just use cheat engine bro
[1:00:27] <Chimeraelite> It's fucking amazing
[1:00:32] <Linconlord> cool
[1:00:45] <initialdario> best be putting on the pyromancy covenant
[1:00:54] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> you need soul of a stray demon not soul of a demon
[1:00:55] <initialdario> farm those seeds
[1:01:02] <%WhereIsWill> turret orb looked so cool too
[1:01:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> RIP Dreg Barrage, you would probably be good in PVP
[1:01:17] <%QuadraticGravity> weren't both on the shop page?
[1:01:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> isn't that the demon on the bridge
[1:01:20] <Zombrocom> The same shop its right next to the normal demon soul
[1:01:21] <%TheDullaMAN> It was right next to Soul of a Demon
[1:01:26] <Scrub_Seeker> stray demon souls are in the chaos servants shop too
[1:01:46] <%ssjklyco> Attack the black holes
[1:01:47] <+encrouched> Cemetery of ass
[1:01:57] <%patriotrenegade> u could totally cheat in the soul of a stray demon with the Reverse Souls mod @PatStaresAt
[1:01:58] <+Lost_Zombie> Soul of a Stray Demon comes from Chaos servants for 10 seeds and 40k souls
[1:02:05] <%starotter70> Well now
[1:02:09] <CheekyBirb> ouch
[1:02:09] <%baronblank> why doesn't he use his spells?
[1:02:12] <%coreyyotto> Can't beat the Champ
[1:02:13] <Scrub_Seeker> this fight is meant to be after dancer-ish
[1:02:14] <%Agami23> zone out and you might be able to just walk past him
[1:02:19] <$luckypineapple> hows this mod pat? I personally really disliked DS3, would this change my mind/
[1:02:19] <+Erimos> @PatStaresAt the shockwaves do dark damage, pick a set with dark resist
[1:02:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is not going to do well on Gundy when she plays in 6 years
[1:02:24] <Glass_Muffin> Is this the enhanced verson of gundyr? @PatStaresAt
[1:02:24] <Zombrocom> You never joined the covenant
[1:02:33] <+yamchadassist> I love elmo he is a good kitty
[1:02:40] <initialdario> Yeah either use your pocket solaire or give up on Gundy for now
[1:02:42] <DXLelouch24> Theres a Stray Demon in Farron Keep and Smouldering lake
[1:02:50] <%QuadraticGravity> @PatStaresAt Chaos servants enables fire seed drops if you wanna do the horde mode for easy drops. When all the dudes die at the end of a wave it checks for covenant drops per dude.
[1:03:04] <Scrub_Seeker> only the farron keep one drops a soul though
[1:03:08] <%YakumoYomi> @baronblank Gundyr's resistant to dark, and those seem to be the only attack spells he has right now.
[1:03:10] <+Erimos> i used the black cleric set and it worked pretty well. beat gundyr pretty early on.
[1:03:12] <+masked_hero_lucky> I love pocket Solaire
[1:03:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> that isn't regular old Gundyr, that's Gündyr
[1:03:28] <cheapdoc> you could learn a regular sorcery and try to cheese him from afar with ranged attacks
[1:03:33] <+OwlLightningMage> This will be the run Pat already won PogChamp
[1:03:33] <%QuadraticGravity> also I'm late to stream, did he do Watchers yet
[1:03:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> OK but THIS time... Kappa
[1:03:40] <Zombrocom> Can you?
[1:03:42] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> can you hit the black holes?
[1:03:43] <Chimeraelite> You can
[1:03:45] <%PaladinDupre> @masked_hero_lucky yo i remade my Solaire build and pocket Solaire is like having my own stand
[1:03:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @QuadraticGravity Not yet
[1:03:47] <initialdario> It's so funny to conceptualize a little Solaire action figure you keep in your pocket then make a wish that he can be a real boy
[1:03:51] <jhonxiolonn> hat's too big, Pat can't see
[1:03:56] <deefykins> Solaire cheeses this fight pretty handily
[1:03:58] <%QuadraticGravity> alright cool, I need to shill SLAB CRAB when the time comes.
[1:04:08] <jhonxiolonn> JUst roll to the sides when he jumps
[1:04:16] <%xcompleasedad> THAT was bullshit
[1:04:18] <Zombrocom> Solaire cheeses everything easily
[1:04:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @PaladinDupre Man, that sounds rad as hell
[1:04:23] <%patriotrenegade> i think i know why From never made this version of Gundyr a real boss
[1:04:24] <a_mad_dragon> yer a wizard patty, throw fireballs at him
[1:04:26] <%patriotrenegade> the camera
[1:04:30] <%xcompleasedad> The hit into the lasers is garbo
[1:04:30] <initialdario> Gotta love when people give advice starting with the word "just"
[1:04:38] <Zombrocom> Yeah, Mod Gundyr is kinda cheap
[1:04:39] <+masked_hero_lucky> Might be fun to play online and use the item that makes you look like a sunbro and fight people with pocket solaire
[1:04:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Just win and don't lose
[1:04:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just kill the boss 4Head
[1:04:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> just do the thing
[1:04:47] <%Laecerelius> Just don't get hit

[1:05:02] <krymzen5> just don't get bodied
[1:05:03] <$lotharrio> ...maybe buy firebombs?
[1:05:03] <Scrub_Seeker> those show up more as his health gets lower
[1:05:04] <Chimeraelite> Yea the flames keep spreading. It's fun
[1:05:04] <+Erimos> We in a minefield now
[1:05:04] <+OwlLightningMage> This fight is so stupid now LUL
[1:05:04] <%GohanHitsugaya> Just do it perfectly

[1:05:30] <%FacetiousAF> did you try to grab his dick AND twist it?
[1:05:34] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> just do combo
[1:05:35] <%spiritofmojave> Only counter is boulder cheese StinkyCheese
[1:05:37] <jhonxiolonn> Stay close and circle around it like if it was a knight
[1:05:37] <%PaladinDupre> Another build I just made today after discovering they fixed Valorheart so it has better scaling and blocks 100
[1:05:40] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> magic kinda sucks on the mid-game
[1:05:44] <%CrookedSpiral> what about magic?
[1:05:44] <TheNumberJay42> dumb mod
[1:05:44] <%DensityD> LUL
[1:05:46] <%patriotrenegade> its a cool boss redesign, but the lock-on and camera ruins it
[1:05:48] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> holy shit
[1:05:49] <%YakumoYomi> Too much HP for firebombs. Also, the nerfed his parry frames, so he's harder to parry.
[1:05:52] <%marsproject> Fuck that fire bomb did NOTHING
[1:05:53] <%xcompleasedad> What about lightning? Kappa
[1:05:53] <%ssjklyco> He's resistant to bitch
[1:05:53] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah this is sorta dumb now
[1:05:54] <Zombrocom> He is -20% to fire, firebombs just suck
[1:05:55] <%hycind53> The arena slowly filling with ritual curse flames is sick as fuck though
[1:06:01] <EyesOfNero> DODGE TO THE SIDES
[1:06:01] <KingKZ> Maybe try not getting hit?
[1:06:04] <+OwlLightningMage> I wouldn't even bother
[1:06:04] <initialdario> initialdario subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:06:04] <%patriotrenegade> also maybe hit the black part of him with the bombs?
[1:06:08] <+Erimos> @PaladinDupre just noticed that too. it was already pretty good but that change makes it amazing.
[1:06:08] <jhonxiolonn> Stay close and dodge to his sides
[1:06:08] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt he is not, he has -20% fire absorption, you hit him during the transformation stage where he has more DR
[1:06:09] <%FacetiousAF> get big sister paige to beat him for you Kappa
[1:06:12] <%WhereIsWill> maybe the turret will be good on this particular boss?
[1:06:12] <cheapdoc> why are you trying to take on gundyr?
[1:06:12] <gluttonousmimic> Don't Fire Bombs scale off Strength?
[1:06:13] <CrypticMochi> Maybe try that zoom out item?
[1:06:14] <%GohanHitsugaya> How fast can you die Pat? Wanna test it out?
[1:06:15] <TheNumberJay42> just dodge duh
[1:06:15] <krymzen5> LUL
[1:06:16] <Chimeraelite> Nah, boss is fine. Just don't lock on like most big n' fast bosses and manage your camera
[1:06:16] <jhonxiolonn> if he jumps, roll to the left or right
[1:06:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kill it before it kills you Kappa
[1:06:18] <cheapdoc> like, why now?
[1:06:20] <%spiritofmojave> Dodge gooder!
[1:06:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Not yet Solaire?
[1:06:23] <$lotharrio> Yeah, maybe big bro Solaire can win for you.
[1:06:25] <%Zulrez> did you try dark fireball?
[1:06:31] <Tucker0603> Anyone know if I go to the dreg heaps will that break the wedlock quest with Anri?
[1:06:34] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I think this enemy is weak to damage.
[1:06:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytBODIED
[1:06:39] <Zombrocom> Double damage LUL
[1:06:40] <TheNumberJay42> big dick damage LUL
[1:06:42] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[1:06:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Big difference LUL
[1:06:45] <+yamchadassist> GG
[1:06:46] <%spiritofmojave> MASSIVE LUL
[1:06:46] <%PaladinDupre> @Erimos the moveset was always good but the terrible blocking made it unuseable in the base game for me
[1:06:47] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[1:06:52] <%kiryuuva> maximum.
[1:06:52] <%coreyyotto> Try a weapon with fire enchantment?
[1:06:53] <%daemonazaezal> WOOOOOO 62 damage
[1:06:53] <Scrub_Seeker> that said the firebombs suck
[1:06:53] <%starotter70> Use the bow Coward
[1:06:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> What if the mod allows for him to be weak to ITEMS but not fire itself?
[1:06:56] <%marsproject> twice of nothing is still nothing
[1:06:56] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> just hit the boss until it dies
[1:06:58] <TonberryLives> So if one were to sum this mod up in word what would that be?
[1:06:59] <jhonxiolonn> ROLL TOWARDS IT
[1:07:00] <Fiend95> What a worthwhile tactic.
[1:07:02] <%Agami23> i just walked past him instead of fighting.
[1:07:02] <SaltyAzteca> Oh Pat is there...oh I remember Gundyr...oh BibleThump
[1:07:03] <+Erimos> @Tucker0603 DLC stuff doesn't affect any basegame side quests.
[1:07:03] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Solaire?
[1:07:06] <+StrawberryLion> Have you tried HEAVE?
[1:07:06] <%averyoddjew> because of you playing this mod, i decided to do the same. holy shit it's really good
[1:07:10] <%patriotrenegade> i remember the corrupted part was weak to fire, but the armor part was not
[1:07:10] <%Ranryu692> but have you tried fire bombs?
[1:07:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TonberryLives collection
[1:07:19] <%DJTanaka> Use dig. It's super effective.
[1:07:25] <%PaladinDupre> @Erimos you can combine it with the ring of momentum and still have the stance for blocking
[1:07:26] <%TheDullaMAN> Give it 3 more tries, Pat.
[1:07:33] <%daemonazaezal> fire bombs do nothing
[1:07:35] <%Fooguwu> try gun
[1:07:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Give it 100 more tries
[1:07:41] <SaltyAzteca> Ember up?
[1:07:43] <krymzen5> i think it looks hard but doable
[1:07:46] <Scrub_Seeker> okay but this time
[1:07:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Try using the Fatman
[1:07:49] <%daemonazaezal> 62 damage in this mode
[1:07:49] <EyesOfNero> dUDE, BLOCK DAMMIT
[1:07:49] <+StrawberryLion> Use the Master Ball
[1:07:51] <%daemonazaezal> mod
[1:07:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> what is this mod it looks cool, what does it do
[1:07:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> >embering for prog
[1:07:57] <Chimeraelite> Yep. It's fuckin HARD but gotta just power through the asshole

[1:08:13] <%DJTanaka> Give it the ol' college try.
[1:08:17] <ahandsomegentleman> as someone who has never experienced the Souls games, I went back and started watching them all
[1:08:21] <Chimeraelite> Dude @EyesOfNero chill and he blocked earlier. Didn't help much
[1:08:28] <%Laecerelius> not great but not terrible
[1:08:30] <%TheWinged7> time to lame it out
[1:08:30] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Dark sucks against this guy, but have fun
[1:08:36] <Scrub_Seeker> he has 40% dark damage resistance but you do a lot of dark damage
[1:08:39] <%FacetiousAF> zoning the rushdown?
[1:08:42] <%patriotrenegade> yeah i dont know
[1:08:45] <%Laecerelius> gotta watch out for his POWAH WAIVEs
[1:08:50] <jhonxiolonn> He's more dangerous from afar
[1:08:51] <%TheWinged7> @Laecerelius Is this really what you want?
[1:08:58] <%spiritofmojave> Weird
[1:09:01] <%FacetiousAF> dope visual tho

[1:09:05] <%Piemen99> wild
[1:09:07] <%DJTanaka> Modder is playing mid games.
[1:09:07] <coracor> do they do anything to the boss?
[1:09:08] <Zombrocom> That's a bug
[1:09:16] <%marsproject> Do the big cheese pat
[1:09:16] <KingKZ> Watch one of them do something.
[1:09:16] <cheapdoc> i'm shocked you poised through his attack with your magic
[1:09:20] <Chimeraelite> Cause they hurt me plenty
[1:09:22] <%coreyyotto> maybe they serve as a kind of anchor for some of his AOE attacks?
[1:09:25] <%DensityD> rats, maybe this time
[1:09:25] <+Erimos> They absolutely do hurt, can confirm
[1:09:28] <%FacetiousAF> this is a motherfucker

[1:13:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Pro strats
[1:13:08] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt the spell deflect ring is OP, you can sometimes walk right through the ringed city angel barrages
[1:13:09] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:13:12] <%Valdorick> Goblins are COWARDS
[1:13:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> I get a bonus 50 bucks every week
[1:13:13] <Personified134> LUL
[1:13:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> sooo
[1:13:14] <%DensityD> FAT ORKS FAT ORKS FAT ORKS SMOrc
[1:13:16] <Zombrocom> How
[1:13:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> just felt like it
[1:13:17] <%depressed_skeleton> Haha hehe peepee poopoo
[1:13:20] <+oda_flobunaga> the best kind of dongi
[1:13:20] <squirtkitten> I dont get it guys, is DS hard, or is it easy? I always hear both LUL
[1:13:22] <%corgispudmen> watch Manadlore
[1:13:26] <ahandsomegentleman> that's like telling me not to use an x-potion against the gi tribe boss in ffvii
[1:13:33] <%QuadraticGravity> it's alright just wait till you have a hundred guys yelling instructions once they see your army setup
[1:13:33] <cheapdoc> FOR MANDALORE
[1:13:34] <LixFury> @squirtkitten yes
[1:13:35] <$QuesoFM> have you looked up battle tutorials?
[1:13:37] <roobanguy> have you watched any tutorial videos on youtube for warhammer 2? i was getting my ass kicked until i watched some
[1:13:38] <%initialdario> The biggest disappointment in this mod is when "Bloodborne" weapons show up but they're just reskins of archetypes with no swap moves
[1:13:41] <%DensityD> he did watch mandalore and he loved it
[1:13:48] <Personified134> DS is hard until you "Get It" and then its easy
[1:13:48] <Zombrocom> Yeyeye abyss watchers woo
[1:13:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @squirtkitten hard with self restrictions, easier with summoning
[1:13:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Thoe Bois PogChamp
[1:13:52] <oldwolfblood> PRO gamer move
[1:13:53] <%WhereIsWill> wolf boiz YEYEYE
[1:13:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @squirtkitten It's not as hard as it's made out to be, but not that easy either
[1:13:54] <RetributionP> I prefer Shogun 2
[1:13:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> *the Boiz
[1:13:56] <TonberryLives> DS is hard until it's easy
[1:13:58] <squirtkitten> @Sphincter_Spelunker So is it hard or easy? LUL
[1:13:59] <%spiritofmojave> @squirtkitten this one was originally was pretty easy, 2 is artificially hard, one imo is somewhere in between
[1:14:01] <+Erimos> The Artorias Fanclub
[1:14:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ye
[1:14:06] <Personified134> WAAAAAAUGH
[1:14:13] <squirtkitten> @spiritofmojave they're all artificially hard LUL
[1:14:14] <roobanguy> oh yeah, thats kind of bone city
[1:14:15] <+oda_flobunaga> TACTICS Pat
[1:14:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Abyss Watchers is a strong boss fight
[1:14:15] <Chimeraelite> oh this'll be fun. I haven't fought these guys on my playthrough
[1:14:18] <%PaladinDupre> Solaire one shots the adds in the first stage
[1:14:18] <%king_wragles> Have you tried just winning anyway?
[1:14:20] <%DensityD> LUL yeah they like to hurt you at that point LUL
[1:14:25] <reavingd00m> Have you tried playing it like Civ and just auto resolving every battle? That's how I play it nathanDerp
[1:14:28] <%WhereIsWill> simps for artorias psaSmug
[1:14:30] <%FacetiousAF> can you cheese the 4x?
[1:14:33] <Zombrocom> Well first off, do the Vortex one first, it's better for a learning experience
[1:14:34] <GameOver_Here> You should retreat if you can
[1:14:36] <%cureneckbeard> pat just run away and come back with more doods.
[1:14:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> that kind of defeats the point though
[1:14:38] <Neo_Kaiser> Use your WAAARGH
[1:14:38] <%LonePlus_> just like, do it bro
[1:14:38] <roobanguy> god that would be the worst way to play it haha
[1:14:41] <Scrub_Seeker> auto resolve in total war sucks tho
[1:14:42] <cheapdoc> just reverse goblin slayer the brits
[1:14:43] <CheekyBirb> you can't say ds2 was artificially hard because of mobs when all three of them had big mobs LUL
[1:14:44] <%hycind53> Mandalore got added as a knight too, he's from Pigbarter
[1:14:48] <RetributionP> auto resolve? that's like the woste way to play
[1:14:49] <%spiritofmojave> @squirtkitten 2 relative to the others tho, but yeah I see where you're comin from :b
[1:14:49] <Personified134> autoresolving eveyr battle is missing like half of the game
[1:14:53] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[1:14:55] <%initialdario> let's just play the game by summoning Solaire and sitting back. And if he doesn't kill em immediately, PANIC
[1:14:55] <%QuadraticGravity> im gonna play some Endless Legend for a bit, enjoy game.
[1:14:56] <%patriotrenegade> he doesa
[1:14:57] <RetributionP> what is even the point
[1:14:59] <%WhereIsWill> he will NOT leave you alone LIL
[1:15:01] <+Dudealy> Those big dudes look like they would make a cute plushie
[1:15:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> He speaks for the trees
[1:15:06] <%ssjklyco> He's rooting for you
[1:15:08] <Scrub_Seeker> he wants to tell you about grossmart
[1:15:08] <%DensityD> "I squish you with tree roots" :P
[1:15:10] <%patriotrenegade> U COME INTO HIS WOODS
[1:15:12] <+Erimos> haha tree go brrrrrr
[1:15:18] <Chimeraelite> LuL
[1:15:18] <GameOver_Here> I auto resolve when the battle is super one sided to save time. I fight the close ones.
[1:15:18] <+senro1> were the big dudes in the ds3 game ??
[1:15:19] <%Binary_Fireball> he looks smelly
[1:15:23] <%Binary_Fireball> smelly tree
[1:15:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Make like a tree and fuck off
[1:15:24] <%initialdario> Pocket Solaire is Cinder's Tarkus
[1:15:25] <Sauceboss15> one of my least favourite enemies on the game for sure
[1:15:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Summon Solaire again
[1:15:30] <%kiryuuva> goodness.
[1:15:34] <ahandsomegentleman> thanks, trres
[1:15:35] <%TaterBurglar> I haven't played the Grom campaign in TWW2 yet, but there is the possibility of just making a retreat away from Bretonnians, a la Liu Bei, and just taking a string of cities until you get somewhere that is better for you
[1:15:35] <%PaladinDupre> Pat it seems like this old man has some complaints he'd like to log with you
[1:15:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Fuck balance. Summon all day every day
[1:15:49] <%ikehildaman> That was Shrek defending his swamp
[1:15:50] <roobanguy> ive been using the ring that gives you quickstep instead of block to beat those dudes
[1:16:08] <%Binary_Fireball> Don't fight it
[1:16:11] <Onamar> Retreat
[1:16:11] <%Binary_Fireball> run from it
[1:16:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> you can't get away and recruit more units?
[1:16:14] <%QuadraticGravity> It might want you to run?
[1:16:14] <huskarl_zap> Auto resolve lied
[1:16:15] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Do the vortex campaign, it's a better campaign to learn on
[1:16:16] <%Fooguwu> item
[1:16:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Touching tips.
[1:16:17] <+StrawberryLion> Don't fight it.exe
[1:16:18] <%FacetiousAF> shrek the dark mage
[1:16:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> To flee, or die
[1:16:18] <+oda_flobunaga> build new units to power it up
[1:16:21] <%TaterBurglar> Yeah you can just retreat
[1:16:26] <+HypestMoose> go to a city and recruit
[1:16:29] <spacecatstreams> how come these souls so dark?
[1:16:33] <%DensityD> the auto resolve always disfavors the player, until CA massively revamps the AI. and they don't want to.
[1:16:34] <%TaterBurglar> A big part of Total War is just picking your fights
[1:16:39] <%toolofparanoia> gotta be brutally cunning pat
[1:16:39] <%corgispudmen> which campign are playing
[1:16:45] <huskarl_zap> Auto resolve is wrong to get people to play more
[1:16:45] <%Binary_Fireball> I think it's slightly random
[1:16:45] <roobanguy> honestly in warhammer 2 i'm extremely boring and just play the Empire
[1:16:46] <%PaladinDupre> its that thing from Star Trek, figure out how to cheat it like Kirk did
[1:16:46] <%Fooguwu> eye tem
[1:16:46] <+StrawberryLion> SMOrc
[1:16:47] <%TaterBurglar> To goad you into making bad decisions
[1:16:47] <%cureneckbeard> never a fight a battle except on your own terms
[1:16:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Drama?
[1:16:50] <CheekyBirb> why not Kappa
[1:16:53] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> to make it a challenge?
[1:16:54] <$sniffy77> pat you gotta use your stratego
[1:16:56] <RetributionP> to make the baddies die
[1:16:56] <%QuadraticGravity> to teach you a lesson, old man psaFist
[1:16:56] <%starotter70> It's been a minute since I've played DS3, are da boyz coming up?
[1:17:00] <%transporterthesequel> Probably to force you to run.
[1:17:01] <+oda_flobunaga> PICK YOUR FIGHTS DON'T BE AN IJIT?
[1:17:01] <%cureneckbeard> Pat go read Art of War
[1:17:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> its like showing you a boss that you're too weak to fight right now, you have to level up and come back later
[1:17:04] <+Bullet_harrier> Why’re you not doing the vortex campaign first? It’s a normal start as opposed to a hard one
[1:17:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> >Playing Byzantium against the Ottomans
[1:17:13] <j0ustar> "I'm next to an army, I MUST fight"
[1:17:15] <GameOver_Here> Sometimes they start you off at a disadvantage depending on your lord.
[1:17:16] <roobanguy> because pat want to be smashy bois
[1:17:16] <+Erimos> Fight club over there
[1:17:28] <%PaladinDupre> the Kobyashi Maru
[1:17:30] <+StrawberryLion> Pat is role playing the Greenskins perfectly
[1:17:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @SilvaChariot0133 Just get the Polish to help you :)
[1:17:31] <huskarl_zap> first enemy near you is suppose to be beatable I doubt his campaign is harf
[1:17:33] <+Redpointshine> ITS ISTANBUL PAT, ACCEPT IT.
[1:17:34] <+oda_flobunaga> or try Battlefleet Gothic Armada, its COOL
[1:17:35] <%cureneckbeard> If fighting will not result in victory then you must not fight. Sun Tzu said that, and I think he'd know a little more about fighting then you do, Pat, because he invented it
[1:17:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Drama. Why put a pedo clown man next to a weird mountain kid and and kid that loves to murder things? For the drama
[1:17:37] <GameOver_Here> Some Lord's starting places are easier than others
[1:17:40] <%DensityD> haha magic
[1:17:45] <%silverira> isn't the idea of games like warhammer to build your forces then just roll over your enemies?
[1:17:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> :^)
[1:18:03] <%Laecerelius> Angry boy!
[1:18:05] <Zombrocom> He hangry
[1:18:05] <+OwlLightningMage> BALANCE
[1:18:05] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Nice hat, Kung Lao-ser <3
[1:18:07] <%kiryuuva> he doesn't like it.
[1:18:08] <%spiritofmojave> He's supposed to be napping!
[1:18:11] <CheekyBirb> it's just a prank crystal lizard
[1:18:12] <+Erimos> You killed her babies
[1:18:12] <+StrawberryLion> Why you mad it is just game
[1:18:13] <%starotter70> PunOko
[1:18:15] <huskarl_zap> I've only played his vortex campaign
[1:18:17] <Fiend95> Lizard want to monch
[1:18:18] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt try the orb that shoots orbs
[1:18:19] <%JaydenSai> @Fuggins4U Howdy Fugs!
[1:18:20] <%TaterBurglar> It sounds a lot like the goal for the Grom campaign is to retreat and come back another time, cause your gobbos aren't going to beat Bretonnian knights without some backup
[1:18:26] <%starotter70> Hey Fugs
[1:18:28] <j0ustar> He wants your McNuggies Pat
[1:18:34] <%DensityD> gotcha bix
[1:18:35] <%FacetiousAF> can you imagine these things scaling with all the dead lizards
[1:18:44] <+Redpointshine> What a pointy boy
[1:18:45] <huskarl_zap> truth be told idk what Pat's issues are so I cant help
[1:18:49] <@Fuggins4U> hi gang, just wanted to say hi after work, hope you're enjoying the strem w/ fren
[1:18:57] <%QuadraticGravity> I really don't remember there being so many visceral attack opportunities in DS3, are some of those modded?

[1:19:18] <Zombrocom> Seriously, do the vortex one
[1:19:20] <%Shadowthedigger> Grom is also a HARD start Pat
[1:19:20] <%DensityD> I'm still glad you will play and stream it. that's a good determined attitude.
[1:19:21] <%Laecerelius> Speedrun!
[1:19:23] <j0ustar> Perfect run
[1:19:24] <%marsproject> Bravely run away
[1:19:25] <%Fooguwu> if fuggins is 4 me, how much fuggins can i have?

[1:19:32] <%WhereIsWill> sounds like a good one tomorrow yeyeye
[1:19:32] <+Overlordkain> yes he is
[1:19:32] <@commanderclaw> Yes he is
[1:19:33] <%Binary_Fireball> Patience Pat and in time you will become lord of the boyzz
[1:19:37] <%asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Any place I can get the old pillars 2 playthrough you did with spy and plauge?
[1:19:38] <@commanderclaw> He is
[1:19:39] <+Overlordkain> yes.. he is
[1:19:40] <%YakumoYomi> Good guy @Fuggins4U droppin' in.
[1:19:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> you should learn with a faction that has an easier start
[1:19:41] <%corgispudmen> you did the old world map
[1:19:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Good boss time! PogChamp Unless the mod ruined it LUL
[1:19:47] <Zombrocom> I am playing it right now dude
[1:19:48] <+HypestMoose> sometimes you recruit first turn instead of fighting
[1:19:48] <@Fuggins4U> @PaladinDupre I alternate between him and Paige, until the re-fuse into True Piccolo
[1:19:50] <@commanderclaw> I am playing a Vortex campaign with Grom right now
[1:19:53] <%strakillias> Yes he is pat
[1:19:54] <krymzen5> mmm
[1:19:55] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt take advice from those of us who understand Total War and you will do better
[1:19:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> So like is this total warhammer game really tough or is it Pat's weird goblins
[1:19:56] <cheapdoc> crazy talk activate
[1:19:58] <%kiryuuva> wraxuSip
[1:20:02] <huskarl_zap> I made a text file but I cant send it to you through twitch
[1:20:03] <Zombrocom> You misunderstood dude
[1:20:03] <+Overlordkain> no, mandalore mentions he does not take part in the rituals
[1:20:03] <%Shadowthedigger> No he said he doesn't care about the Vortex part.
[1:20:06] <%Shadowthedigger> He's still on the map
[1:20:07] <%FacetiousAF> sounds like pat and claw need to talk
[1:20:11] <%QuadraticGravity> He doesn't play FOR the vortex as an objective
[1:20:13] <@commanderclaw> He doesn't do rituals
[1:20:16] <huskarl_zap> I played his vortex today
[1:20:18] <%TheSniperJoe> psaWrong psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:20:19] <+Majiinbooh> can confirm grom is available for voertex
[1:20:21] <%QuadraticGravity> the vortex is king of the hill and he ignores the hill
[1:20:22] <+StrawberryLion> Crazy talk has begun
[1:20:22] <Futurecity10> No, Mandalore literally said they dont PARTICIPATE during the vortex campaign
[1:20:24] <%FacetiousAF> monkaS these wraiths
[1:20:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He wasn't there until Crazy Talk retroactively made Pat wrong
[1:20:35] <%FacetiousAF> chat has anyone kept up with the fire seed count?
[1:20:37] <+Redpointshine> Darkwraiths LUL
[1:20:37] <%kiryuuva> wraiths are so cool.
[1:20:37] <%corgispudmen> Grom dosent do the vortex but is there

[1:24:26] <%spiritofmojave> He arrived right on cue :)
[1:24:28] <+Shin_Mando> are the enemy attacks faster in this game mod, or am I slower?
[1:24:28] <mostundesired> @Shillk Thanks my dude.
[1:24:31] <%kiryuuva> i love the abyss watcher's designs.
[1:24:31] <RetroCop87> didn't they used to attack each other as well?

[1:25:35] <%Keyd00d> I love the dude that just fights the other dudes
[1:25:36] <%FacetiousAF> ... does pat need the weaker sword spell? how would poise even work on this boss if at all
[1:25:37] <Scrub_Seeker> the additional watchers have way less health in ciders, so you can actually focus them down
[1:25:39] <%trustycoyote> Love the mechanics of the sword! So fucking awesome
[1:25:42] <Mechazoic_Era> DORIFTO

[1:26:44] <%YakumoYomi> Ghrus and Darkwraiths duking it out behind the fogwall
[1:26:51] <%spiritofmojave> overwhelming assault by a bunch of dudes coming earlier and earlier in is way cooler as a rebalance concept
[1:26:53] <RetributionP> favorite boss to parry
[1:26:59] <Chimeraelite> LuL
[1:26:59] <%kiryuuva> he's super into it.

[1:28:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh jeez
[1:28:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Posed on
[1:28:09] <Kingdom_65> @commanderclaw It's a really good fight and amazing theme in general that's a reference to Artorias while not being direct nostalgia bait.
[1:28:10] <%Archphronimos> oh shit it's Nova Prime
[1:28:10] <%weissguard> ResurreCTION
[1:28:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You should not be able to block that though

[1:28:36] <AceArann> It's Gwyn, the fire lord!
[1:28:39] <Zombrocom> They are artorias fanboys, but they have their own style with the greatsword dagger combo its cool
[1:28:41] <+liquidzr0> SirSword
[1:28:43] <mostundesired> Rolling backwards against Abyss Watchers LUL
[1:28:45] <+linSP> BACK STABBUU
[1:28:48] <%weissguard> BAHNING
[1:28:50] <cheapdoc> nice buttstab
[1:28:52] <ECRead> oh hey some of those are totally Maria's moves
[1:28:53] <%herecomesmong0> that slide with the fire explosion is so sick
[1:28:54] <@Fuggins4U> this seems more difficult than in the original game
[1:28:57] <EMP_Ike_Turner> HEAT UP
[1:28:57] <squirtkitten> 0 damage LUL
[1:29:01] <%spiritofmojave> @ecread for sure yes
[1:29:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It's loud roar tells me to GRASP VICTORY
[1:29:09] <TheArrow_> he just doesn't stop
[1:29:11] <PanicSwytch> This was the boss fight that made me love the game even more
[1:29:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> maria+gascoigne
[1:29:11] <j0ustar> no do it tho
[1:29:11] <Zombrocom> Yeah he has like triple health
[1:29:12] <%twoto858> A lot more tanky, that's for sure
[1:29:13] <%ElkRiverDog> Nice backstab
[1:29:15] <Broand> hit him with a pickaxe
[1:29:16] <thebestestkevin> @Fuggins4U the abysswatchers have waaaay more health
[1:29:17] <%rytyoung> Very aggressive, who shat in his cornflakes LUL
[1:29:20] <Chimeraelite> All the aggro
[1:29:21] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> was he always this aggressive?
[1:29:22] <+metalsiren31> The biggest change seems to be that he just has more health
[1:29:23] <%herecomesmong0> he forgot what cooldowns were
[1:29:25] <RetributionP> just parry him Kappa
[1:29:27] <%Archphronimos> Hey so are the Abyss Watchers basically cooler Knights of Ren but with Artorias instead of Ben Swolo?
[1:29:28] <%PaladinDupre> EMBER UP
[1:29:31] <zamzoph> F
[1:29:36] <cheapdoc> BURNING FINGAAAAH
[1:29:36] <+Erimos> So glad they scaled up his health so you can enjoy the fight more.

[1:29:42] <+Draegen86> @Archphronimos yes
[1:29:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @AsslessChapsVEVO in this phase, I remember him being so
[1:29:43] <squirtkitten> more health and high damage = hard boss fight Kappa
[1:29:44] <Chimeraelite> I like the more HP change tbh. You can't just power through fights and ignore their moveset. You gotta learn it
[1:29:46] <%FacetiousAF> fight's fuckin rad tho
[1:29:49] <%kiryuuva> he just runs off. LUL

[1:30:30] <squirtkitten> omg the circlejerk about 'hard' games LUL
[1:30:31] <%rytyoung> True LUL
[1:30:32] <%kiryuuva> using a game mechanic is cheating?
[1:30:32] <%herecomesmong0> but its a vanilla mechanic
[1:30:33] <%Laecerelius> "That's cheating" says man who has Solaire beat a boss for him
[1:30:35] <j0ustar> I mean
[1:30:35] <+Draegen86> LOL Got 'em
[1:30:35] <mostundesired> LUL
[1:30:35] <@commanderclaw> "You shouldn't cheat unless things aren't going your way" Pat
[1:30:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Embers are slow though
[1:30:35] <TheSlothCast> if only this mod was multiplayer compatable, then it would be chef's kiss
[1:30:36] <Mrbaconator> wat
[1:30:37] <%WhereIsWill> yeah that's super fair
[1:30:39] <+blastazoid26> Pat youre a big nerd
[1:30:42] <%corgispudmen> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:30:42] <Scrummo> @patstaresat his knife will always bounce off your shield. you can use that to get swings in
[1:30:44] <%spiritofmojave> Cheating and PVP 'HONOR' LUL
[1:30:45] <%FacetiousAF> LIES
[1:30:46] <%Ranryu692> LOL
[1:30:46] <%TheWinged7> yes he did
[1:30:49] <+Erimos> LUL
[1:30:53] <wilwright00> !uptime
[1:30:53] <+textandnumbers> so pat dropped persona to summon a persona in this game?
[1:30:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 31m.
[1:30:54] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:30:54] <cheapdoc> I'M SURE PATRICK
[1:30:58] <+Axellogic> sorry pat I didnt know you were an idiot
[1:31:01] <+Axellogic> :V
[1:31:01] <%QuadraticGravity> @TheSlothCast it's multiplayer compatible. You just have to get yourself softbanned to do so.
[1:31:04] <%marsproject> Solaire does not cheat.
[1:31:04] <Gamer76255> So Solaire is the Ashen One then? Why are you here
[1:31:05] <%TheWinged7> you could always learn to parry him
[1:31:08] <jhonxiolonn> Don't let Pat use Solair
[1:31:08] <SMuffinMan> LUL
[1:31:11] <%TheStarbecue> i found my sun, it was cheating
[1:31:13] <%PaladinDupre> There is a normal NPC summon for this.
[1:31:18] <j0ustar> Pat is running a Solaire support build Kappa
[1:31:19] <mostundesired> He's really not that hard to parry.
[1:31:20] <LSpiral> remember pat, there are no cheap moves
[1:31:20] <TheSlothCast> @QuadraticGravity but you have to put yourself in the Cheaters room, which is hoo boy
[1:31:21] <%PaladinDupre> right by the bonfire
[1:31:23] <%TheWinged7> or jsut wait til his 3rd hit string and backstab him easy
[1:31:24] <LSpiral> you play to win
[1:31:27] <%patriotrenegade> ohh
[1:31:28] <Gamer76255> Off to a greay start
[1:31:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> good start
[1:31:32] <%spiritofmojave> Solaire summoner build is how you play :)
[1:31:32] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pat is Solairs little helper.
[1:31:42] <%baronblank> get your 17000 souls pat
[1:31:48] <RetributionP> that first attack is so easy to parrt
[1:31:50] <+Draegen86> Quick - rename the channel to SolaireStaresAt
[1:31:54] <cheapdoc> they seem to stagger way more than before tho
[1:31:55] <Scrummo> pack a Boulder Heave with you for some StinkyCheese
[1:32:02] <%QuadraticGravity> @TheSlothCast Multiplayer passwords still work, the mod author even says to use the Cinders password if you do it to make things smoother.
[1:32:04] <TheSlothCast> what kinda goodies did this mod give to Pyromancers? I wanted to get another Burger King run in :D
[1:32:08] <+TheBitingIrish> wtf

[1:39:01] <RetroCop87> Angriest Pat would have taken the last flame by now
[1:39:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Scrummo What doesn't get pancaked by the Boulder tho :)
[1:39:08] <TheSlothCast> is it possible for the mod to be so good that Namco would want to shut it down?
[1:39:09] <mostundesired> RIP those souls by the way.
[1:39:16] <+Erimos> SPIN TO WIN
[1:39:26] <%Agami23> just as a friendly reminder for anyone who is interested in the mod. darksouls 3 is 10$ on humble bundle right now, 14$ with all the dlc
[1:39:29] <$ArtooKilledYou> Speeeeeeen
[1:39:36] <%possumwalsh1221> Shits still going down outside LUL
[1:39:37] <cheapdoc> who cares about the souls, this mod gives you like a billion souls just from a run
[1:39:37] <Scrummo> @valentinius_anodyne good point
[1:39:40] <%FacetiousAF> agami they might be out of keys
[1:39:41] <%JaydenSai> @TheSlothCast I don't think that's something you need to worry about, Bamco isnt Nintendo levels of bad
[1:39:47] <gamingpenguin52> on vanilla ds3 i always do this fight with a str build and a great club +8 or so and kill these dudes in 6 hits between the 2 phases
[1:39:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> people were just saying there were no keys atm
[1:39:51] <RetributionP> I wish my laptop could run ds3
[1:39:51] <%Agami23> that can happen?
[1:39:57] <%Bluwizard21> oof missed the stream coming on
[1:40:04] <%Bluwizard21> how long we been running?
[1:40:06] <+OwlLightningMage> People are reporting that there's no more humble keys
[1:40:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> nyooom
[1:40:12] <Ciglossonjr> I want my fucking key damnit
[1:40:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 90 minutes
[1:40:21] <LSpiral> if pat was really desperate for souls he could just farm at archdragon peak for a bit or something
[1:40:23] <%FacetiousAF> hour and a half blu, the most you really missed was gundyr
[1:40:28] <TheSlothCast> lol confirmed no more keys, blame Pat

[1:40:51] <%Bearphonics> watching pat play dark souls really reminds me of how i play it, and it's quite reassuring
[1:40:54] <CheekyBirb> we tekken now boys Kappa
[1:40:58] <%kiryuuva> !uptime
[1:40:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m.
[1:41:00] <TheSlothCast> omg dark souls is a fighting game now I hate it
[1:41:03] <%DappercatEsquire> good trade
[1:41:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark souls needs more juggling
[1:41:12] <%baronblank> pat do high time
[1:41:13] <%YakumoYomi> @TheSlothCast Unlikely. The game has been out for 4 years now, and Bandai Namco typically doesn't give a shit about that kind of thing. By the way, if you want to pick up DS3, GameBillet has it on sale.
[1:41:13] <+Erimos> PogChamp
[1:41:17] <+bluedude153> it literally says uptime by defult under the video now
[1:41:19] <%DappercatEsquire> pat do a stinger
[1:41:25] <09havocworm> This guy looks tough
[1:41:27] <j0ustar> Big Influencer PatStaresAt cleans out DS3 steam keys from Humble Bundle through advertising
[1:41:34] <Ciglossonjr> It really confuses me why Pat's using his shield to block them, I guess i'm too used to bloodborne
[1:41:37] <+SinisterBroccoli> Does Pat's ranged spells not work well against these guys?
[1:41:37] <%kiryuuva> monkaS
[1:41:38] <TheSlothCast> @YakumoYomi waiting for my Humble Bundle key to refresh :)
[1:41:39] <cheapdoc> wait, if dark souls is fighting game and fighting game is anime, then dark souls is anime now?
[1:41:39] <%DappercatEsquire> yeah mosh harder
[1:41:53] <+Redpointshine> +1 BAY BAY PogChamp
[1:41:54] <+fiiive> I just beat ds2 (beat demon and ds1 as well) just starting 3. is magic viable. the only other game I liked it and was useful was in demons

[1:41:54] <%DappercatEsquire> @cheapdoc what does that make Code Vein?
[1:41:57] <jhonxiolonn> bad
[1:41:57] <%FacetiousAF> sinister they'd probably rush his ass down
[1:42:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What's for breakfast, Pat? You keep waking up into meaty.

[1:42:59] <PanicSwytch> As long as Pat loses, i get to keep hearing this awesome soundtrack
[1:43:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> to each their own, but Cinders is straight up better than base DS3 in every way imo
[1:43:02] <%possumwalsh1221> Definitely lobos
[1:43:04] <%TheFabledAble> all the pvp nerds want access to the pvp pool and wont use mods as a result
[1:43:07] <%TheREALGirthMan> lobosMindBlank
[1:43:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DoA sucks, it just inserts dumb fanfic and shit into DS1
[1:43:18] <DXLelouch24> Damn Pat at this rate ill beat Deacons before you beat Abyss Watchers
[1:43:19] <Stillchr> need to go back in and play demon again
[1:43:19] <Commander_Spyke> It's not masochism if you're actually good wixRich
[1:43:25] <%kiryuuva> dark souls 3 ost do be hittin' though.
[1:43:25] <CheekyBirb> calling people purists for prefeerign one mod over another? Kappa
[1:43:26] <+Erimos> Cinders has good masochist options though. It's just more exploitable, it seems.
[1:43:27] <wunderkindest> I'm one of the PvP nerds, but Cinders is so fun for me even in PvE
[1:43:29] <%TheREALGirthMan> F
[1:43:30] <+Redpointshine> +1 IN CHAT BOIZ
[1:43:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Cinders is a mixed bag
[1:43:35] <%trustycoyote> I love Dark Souls cause I like Action RPGs and Fantasy.
[1:43:35] <%TheSniperJoe> Stuffed.
[1:43:36] <jhonxiolonn> @PatStaresAt Any chance of you playing King's field on stream?
[1:43:40] <TheSlothCast> god its such a shame Cinders puts you into the cheater pool
[1:43:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP
[1:43:41] <%AngriestAngryArtist> wtf they can fight each other?
[1:43:45] <cheapdoc> maybe get the summon from outside?
[1:43:56] <%TheDullaMAN> You need to be able to attack faster and wider.
[1:43:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DoA ruins alot of enemy placment and bonefire placement, along with cheap fanfic that feels VERY out of place
[1:43:56] <garbageheaphound> THATS A PULL
[1:43:58] <Thalchampz> LUL kign's field

[1:44:03] <+Redpointshine> DEATH COUNT 6
[1:44:05] <%Laecerelius> I need to go back and play King's Field at some point
[1:44:09] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:44:10] <+fiiive> idc what anyone says
[1:44:11] <CheekyBirb> @AngriestAngryArtist they always could
[1:44:13] <j0ustar> nevah evuh
[1:44:14] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> Hey been watching the past vids on the cinders mod. Dont know if this was asked yet but did miracles get buffed in the mod?
[1:44:15] <a_mad_dragon> early fromsoft games are rough, it took them forever to figure out right stick camera control
[1:44:17] <%CalderGaming> head over to dnopls for king's field iii
[1:44:21] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, you might wanna give the other Abyssal Sword attack a try.
[1:44:21] <cheapdoc> pat has more chances of playing dnd than kingsfield
[1:44:21] <+OwlLightningMage> @angriestangryartist They always could. That's one of the things people love about the fight.
[1:44:23] <mostundesired> Yeah, he's gotta play Chaos Legion first.
[1:44:24] <RushUnplugged> to be honest both mods are kind of the "I played this too much, I want something new" type, DoA is just for insane people
[1:44:25] <%Archphronimos> what if we give you money to play it and dance for our amusement? Would you pass up an opportunity to sell out?
[1:44:28] <TheSlothCast> @PaladinDupre well I want multiplayer, but to not be in the cheater pool as well
[1:44:34] <%JaydenSai> @TheBraveLittleClaptrap Oh boy did they. You wanna do an all Miracle run? Do it
[1:44:41] <%starotter70> When's Never Winter Nights?
[1:44:45] <%wirblewomble> I have KF IV, controls are rough, atmosphere and world are amazing
[1:44:46] <%PaladinDupre> @TheSlothCast thats what pocket Solaire is for.
[1:44:46] <%DappercatEsquire> for now
[1:44:53] <%spiritofmojave> Chaos Legion would be a good fit considering the gap of games out rn LUL

[1:45:03] <Aydarkzero> Abyss Watchers theme Kreygasm
[1:45:10] <TheSlothCast> but I wanna fight people too. BibleThump
[1:45:19] <Scrummo> no shame in running away and spamming Soul Dregs
[1:45:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Blue on BLue BibleThump
[1:45:22] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @OwlLightningMage Oh nice so you can just kite all day while they whiff the hell out of each other LOL.
[1:45:25] <%PaladinDupre> @TheSlothCast then play DS2, it had the best PVP
[1:45:27] <$Dakuu75> Just makes me wanna play bloodborn
[1:45:28] <milleniumfalcon69> anyone else play Warhammer 40K inquisitor?
[1:45:35] <+fiiive> the controls on kings field are impossible to fix even in an emulator. also turning frame times up to 60 helped a bit but omg I couldn't figure out shit lol
[1:45:41] <PanicSwytch> I love that the music ramps up as more watchers join the fight
[1:45:43] <%starotter70> This reminds me how some dumbasses in my dorm started a fight club in the meeting room
[1:45:54] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> Yass two games in row miracles got the short end of the stick. Cant wait to have fun with em. Thanks erryone answering.
[1:45:57] <%TheREALGirthMan> +1? Kappa
[1:45:58] <wunderkindest> I lost my shit when I realized the Cleric's Candlestick is actually really awesome in Cinders
[1:46:01] <doritomancerr> monkaS
[1:46:03] <TheSlothCast> maybe I'll have to. Shame tho
[1:46:19] <+fiiive> is ds3 just bloodborne?
[1:46:25] <%PaladinDupre> its real simple. DS1 best single player, DS2 best pvp, DS3 best co-op, Cinders best mod
[1:46:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> @wunderkindest everyone here last night did right with you, along with Pat
[1:46:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bloodborne has more flailing enemies, if you can believe it
[1:46:40] <Aydarkzero> @fiiive yes but also no
[1:46:47] <wunderkindest> My first Cinders run was as a hexer using it, and it was a beast
[1:46:52] <+bluedude153> save us solaire
[1:47:00] <TheSlothCast> i could not get into bloodborne for the life of me. Just too much flailing bs
[1:47:02] <%heartlesshealer> fire is hot
[1:47:04] <+Jaysky> @sphincter_spelunker AWAY! AWAY!
[1:47:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> FOUL BEAST
[1:47:16] <%Caidezes> He keeps rolling right into the fire trail.
[1:47:17] <+OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne still has the best DLC
[1:47:24] <+Jaysky> OH GOD'S!
[1:47:34] <Ciglossonjr> Bloodborne's rad, I love the combat
[1:47:35] <%Keyd00d> that simul-roll
[1:47:37] <%possumwalsh1221> Bloodborne has the best dlc out of pretty much any game tbh
[1:47:40] <%PaladinDupre> agreed, like the look of Bloodborne but didnt get to try it until i got a cheap PS4 for RDR2, it didnt live up to the hype for me
[1:47:44] <+fiiive> does ds3 get brighter or at least a bit of variation on the colors? I'm about where pat is in ds3
[1:47:46] <+TheBitingIrish> What were those health bars in the back LUL
[1:47:47] <PanicSwytch> No fronts stabs after a parry?
[1:47:50] <Aydarkzero> Dark Souls 3 dlc made me feel sad b/c it was over FeelsBadMan
[1:47:51] <$Dakuu75> Beasts all over the shop...
[1:47:53] <%cureneckbeard> perfectly calibrated
[1:47:55] <jhonxiolonn> Come on pat, you can do it
[1:47:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> Ludwig the Accursed/Holy Blade is one of the best boss fights in the entire series, imo. BB was a masterpiece.
[1:48:00] <TheSlothCast> I just feel like Bloodborne punishes you for being aggressive while also encourages you to do so, and it feels like shit
[1:48:03] <+TheBitingIrish> @PanicSwytch It wasn't a parry, just a deflect
[1:48:04] <Scatter0> HeyGuys
[1:48:04] <+fiiive> ds2 dlcs are amazing too
[1:48:06] <+Jaysky> Isn't the BB DLC short though? I enjoyed DS3's final dlc
[1:48:16] <CheekyBirb> best DLC, no one ever fights laurence Kappa
[1:48:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> @TheBitingIrish npcs still having their own fight club outside
[1:48:18] <wunderkindest> Bloodborne's DLC is pretty meaty
[1:48:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Ludwig is such a great boss
[1:48:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat look out!
[1:48:32] <jhonxiolonn> YEAH, you're doing it
[1:48:34] <Ciglossonjr> I never got the feeling that BB punished me for being aggressive
[1:48:37] <+Jaysky> DS2's dlc has blemishes like snow kitty path
[1:48:38] <Scatter0> ingame sound i scuffed
[1:48:44] <Scatter0> is*
[1:48:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Laurence is the best remix of a boss ever
[1:48:47] <%TheREALGirthMan> F
[1:48:48] <cheapdoc> funny how the abysswatchers are supposed to fight the abyss, but you can totally wreck them with abyssal edge
[1:48:48] <FalseKingAki> Twist his dick!!
[1:48:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is a bit random, but are y'all familiar with Shadow Tower and Shadow Tower: Abyss? Older FromSoft games games that have a lot of similarities with King's Field and the Soul games. They're pretty cool, and perhaps worth checking out if you like these games

[1:50:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Honeycrisp is the best apple
[1:50:15] <+Promessa_EX> pink lady
[1:50:15] <%Fooguwu> sink go fssh
[1:50:15] <%possumwalsh1221> Getting your ass kicked
[1:50:15] <%Archphronimos> then they'll be nice and clean maybe
[1:50:18] <%ElkRiverDog> No yellow
[1:50:19] <%cureneckbeard> Just wipe your hands on your shirt
[1:50:23] <%BubbaRands> i want an appul...
[1:50:23] <cheapdoc> 1 wash your hands, 2 dont touch me, 3 wear a mask, 4 dont touch me
[1:50:27] <+aWanderingKaivo> @PaladinDupre might be those cosmetic things the handmaid sells at firelink?
[1:50:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cosmic Crisp apples are fucking overrated
[1:50:28] <%spiritofmojave> Pink delicious apples are best
[1:50:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pink Lady is when there are no more Honeycrisps
[1:50:31] <TheSlothCast> @Jaysky Pontiff Sulyvahn was my favorite boss in all Dark SOuls
[1:50:36] <%Mdub98> Cheer500 hey pat, I’m a huge persona fan but I never played 3, should I go for P3P of FES?
[1:50:42] <%TheWinged7> went to the bathroom, how mant attempts is it now?
[1:50:44] <%Madbearv> p3p
[1:50:45] <%maskofmichael> Dying
[1:50:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> second best boss in base ds3 next to soul of cinder, imo
[1:50:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fuji Apples are pears and therefore bullshit
[1:50:48] <%weissguard> Granny Smith is pretty top tier. For some reason, they're great accompaniment to a headache.
[1:50:48] <jhonxiolonn> and even after all those re fights, pat still sucks at it
[1:50:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Lady Maria should be a fighting game character
[1:50:51] <%PaladinDupre> @aWanderingKaivo it could be but there are some weapons that change appearance on infusion
[1:50:52] <%Fooguwu> psaGib 🍎
[1:50:53] <Scrub_Seeker> red delicious apples are awful, they have no flavor and the texture of paper, who the fuck named them red delicious
[1:50:56] <+Erimos> I'm on Pontiff now and I've been enjoying getting my ass handed to me by him.
[1:50:58] <%TheWinged7> P3p it lets you save *spoiler*
[1:50:58] <ECRead> honey crisp apple + butter + cinnamon is godlike
[1:51:04] <+fiiive> pat is the guy without a mask on outside simply bc its inconvenient y/n
[1:51:04] <cheapdoc> candlestick up the butt with you abyss watchers
[1:51:08] <%heartlesshealer> P3P, FES is for if you only have a PS2
[1:51:12] <%TheWinged7> *if you play femal MC
[1:51:18] <%Archphronimos> Mcintosh apples FTW
[1:51:26] <Scrummo> he has no style, he has no grace. Abyss Watcher is a fuckin disgrace
[1:51:31] <%ElkRiverDog> Opal apples with caramel!!!
[1:51:31] <+fiiive> gala apples or pink lady
[1:51:34] <%Madbearv> pat stop bullying them
[1:51:37] <%starotter70> P3P for a less frustrating battle system
[1:51:39] <TheSlothCast> @Erimos isnt he great?!
[1:51:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Scrub_Seeker It sounds like you've had really bad luch with red delicious apples
[1:51:40] <ECRead> Gala apples are great too
[1:51:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cripps Pink are pretty good apples, I recommend those
[1:51:42] <+ekodrop> braeburn
[1:51:43] <%heartlesshealer> pink lady apples
[1:51:44] <+Jaysky> @theslothcast I got absolutely demolished by him first time. He was my first roadblock in it, weirdly enough his second phase was easier cause of his shadow showing his moves
[1:51:54] <sologarza> Dumb apples best apples
[1:51:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> The best apples are potatoes/
[1:51:54] <Onamar> MonkaS

[1:52:18] <+fiiive> granny smith best green apple
[1:52:19] <+Promessa_EX> tomatos are best apple
[1:52:23] <%FacetiousAF> heavy stinger
[1:52:23] <Zombrocom> Oooh, that hurt
[1:52:24] <%heartlesshealer> half expected someone to chime in with Benora White apples
[1:52:26] <TheSlothCast> yeah second phase did feel like a breath, but it was a different kind of challenge. First phase was such a huge hurdle on my first playthrough tho but beating him was fantastic
[1:52:26] <+OwlLightningMage> That counter hit though
[1:52:28] <PanicSwytch> F
[1:52:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> These guys look like dickheads
[1:52:29] <mostundesired> APPLE

[1:52:40] <koolaid_kevster> do you need to ember yet?
[1:52:41] <j0ustar> cranch
[1:52:41] <+OwlLightningMage> It's like the heaviest stinger to ever sting
[1:52:42] <%cureneckbeard> I just occurs to me that this is like the Ornsteen and Smo fight.
[1:52:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> What about road apples?
[1:52:45] <+ekodrop> sticky face, sticky hands
[1:52:46] <cheapdoc> apple make crunch
[1:52:51] <%slaughtedlamb> Pat got stingered
[1:52:52] <+OwlLightningMage> It's a stinger with two hands
[1:52:53] <+fiiive> you think bloodborne 2 will ever happen
[1:52:57] <%BubbaRands> Cronch closer to the mic Kreygasm
[1:52:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> america explain, what you mean arkansaw
[1:53:00] <%Ranryu692> imagine if Pat always said the name of the food he's eating every time he takes a bite
[1:53:03] <+RenoDeGeneric> wololololol
[1:53:05] <%PaladinDupre> I only got to Pontiff on one build now and it was my Solaire build so I was using Pocket Solaire and miracles to bum rush everything between me and the Sunlight Altar
[1:53:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Wolololololol
[1:53:07] <+Redpointshine> +1 BABY LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:53:07] <%spiritofmojave> what good has ever come out of Arkansas
[1:53:09] <+fiiive> ds4 probably wont
[1:53:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> @fiiive Probably not
[1:53:13] <+Jaysky> Final boss of DS3 DLC is probably my favorite cinematic fight in the game
[1:53:16] <%weissguard> Banora White Apples are pretty good. Kappa
[1:53:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's a swinging stinger, so its the Swinger
[1:53:25] <+Redpointshine> ABYSS BOIZ 8-0
[1:53:26] <+ekodrop> black oxford
[1:53:33] <%possumwalsh1221> @jaysky yeah it was pretty damn good
[1:53:39] <+fiiive> grapple ftw
[1:53:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> I love how he kicks up dust and then hides his next move in it
[1:53:41] <PanicSwytch> Elden Ring is "Technically" DS4
[1:53:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They might not be apples, but I'm gonna grow some Ground Cherries this year, which are delicious worth trying out if you can get them
[1:53:55] <+Erimos> I had a Ghru glitch into the boss arena before. It was fun.
[1:53:58] <CheekyBirb> clipped him with a tipper PogChamp
[1:53:59] <%heartlesshealer> 👏
[1:54:01] <mostundesired> LUCKY TED
[1:54:10] <%cureneckbeard> I like Lucky Ted
[1:54:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> How is Elden Ring technically DS4?

[1:54:33] <+Redpointshine> +1
[1:54:36] <TheSlothCast> stupid question but can you change your displayed name in this mod when you respec your character?
[1:54:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lewd
[1:54:40] <%kewlmyc> dying worrying about the girlfriend
[1:54:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you;re saying because its made by From then Sekiro is technically DS4
[1:54:47] <SMuffinMan> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[1:54:48] <Scrummo> you have any other dark spells?

[1:54:51] <+Redpointshine> DEATH COUNT 9
[1:54:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Glaivemaster Hodir is my favorite Elden Ring boss B)
[1:54:54] <cellularmishap> are ya winning son?
[1:54:58] <%possumwalsh1221> No Paige must stand forever
[1:55:02] <+Jaysky> @possumwalsh1221 Two nobody's fighting over a soul in a big landscape of ash with Thunder clapping all over the place
[1:55:02] <roobanguy> dope, i just beat the abyss walkers in my playthrough two-handing a claymore and useing the quick dodge ring
[1:55:09] <%Bearphonics> SHIT AIN'T GONNA CHANGE IF PAIGE WALKS IN FRONT OF THE TV
[1:55:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> But Elden Ring is a new game with a new setting we know literally nothing about other than that theere's a ring.
[1:55:11] <jhonxiolonn> try to use the faster dark sword spell
[1:55:11] <%Keyd00d> Demon's Souls is Dark Souls 0
[1:55:12] <Ciglossonjr> Just do it perfect Pat
[1:55:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> And it's Elden.
[1:55:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> how long until Pat swallows his pride and summons in a friend to help him clap the abyss watchers
[1:55:16] <cheapdoc> maybe go for something faster rather than bigger
[1:55:18] <SMuffinMan> It's a wild Paige! sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:55:20] <Monkeyweed21> IF the TV is so big, why does it not simply eat Pat and Paige?
[1:55:20] <Aydarkzero> Bloodborne is technically DS4 b/c everybody forgets about Demon's Souls FeelsBadMan
[1:55:21] <%Caidezes> Maybe use faster spells.
[1:55:23] <%TheDullaMAN> Big Damage might not be best. Try Big Speed
[1:55:23] <%CrookedSpiral> would the faster blade spell be of use here?
[1:55:28] <%TheWinged7> is paiges butt still bork
[1:55:30] <+encrouched> ASMR watchers
[1:55:35] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pretty borked still

[1:55:43] <+Redpointshine> +1
[1:55:47] <+Redpointshine> I FEEL IT
[1:55:47] <+OwlLightningMage> We haven't even gotten a gameplay trailer for Elden ring
[1:55:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> Such Paige. So Borken
[1:55:53] <%FacetiousAF> and 10 fire seeds.
[1:55:53] <krymzen5> deep p good
[1:55:57] <jhonxiolonn> you can cast it while running away
[1:56:00] <TheSlothCast> that spell did no damage jeez
[1:56:14] <%Order_of_Mystery> From are taking their sweet time with ER, aren't they? I sure would love to see what that game looks like :(
[1:56:27] <%Keyd00d> Elden Ring is Bayonetta 3 and SMTV combined
[1:56:29] <Scrummo> can someone please explain to me what the various seeds are for? I can't play the mod myself to find out.
[1:56:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't get why so many people remember Demon Souls fondly.
[1:56:31] <%possumwalsh1221> She’s not wrong LUL
[1:56:32] <jhonxiolonn> @PatStaresAt You can cast magic while running if you use the Sprint ring
[1:56:32] <TheSlothCast> ER has to be a next gen game at this rate
[1:56:33] <%DappercatEsquire> 10-0
[1:56:35] <krymzen5> probs looks like souls tbh
[1:56:39] <+OwlLightningMage> How much of Elden Ring taking forever is GRRM? LUL
[1:56:39] <%starotter70> I would hope Paige's butt heals in a couple days, but I don't want to ASSume anything
[1:56:41] <+gfoul> the sound of true love
[1:56:46] <%spiritofmojave> Brownies Pog
[1:56:46] <%DappercatEsquire> we warframe now, fuckin 10-0

[1:56:55] <mostundesired> LUL
[1:56:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> @OwlLightningMage Probably not as much as you think
[1:56:59] <%starotter70> EEEEH?
[1:57:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hey, if Elden Ring doesn't have to cut out so much compared to Souls games then it might be worth the wait
[1:57:06] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @rumtumtugnutz nostalgia, for a lot of people it was their first Souls game, or anything like it
[1:57:06] <%spiritofmojave> Booooo LUL
[1:57:08] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Scrummo like the fire seed? its a covenant item, covenants in the mod let any enemy drop your covenant item when equipped
[1:57:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> wololololololoolololol
[1:57:11] <+OwlLightningMage> He didn't finish that book and he probably isn't writing that either LUL
[1:57:12] <LSpiral> how long until pat coward outs and uses solaire
[1:57:13] <VultsTV> dont summon solaire for bosses he makes them a joke
[1:57:13] <+Jaysky> I think they revealed Elden Ring a bit too early
[1:57:13] <%Bearphonics> You know what what I love about DS3?
[1:57:14] <PanicSwytch> @xerosigmaprime LUL LUL
[1:57:14] <%BubbaRands> Apple Brownies?! DasGame but PogChamp

[1:57:36] <%weissguard> 6/10 - Not enough Puntificating
[1:57:37] <j0ustar> you two keep eating this late and you're both going to become chungusaureses
[1:57:40] <%spiritofmojave> Elden Ring's script is probably in writer hell with GRRM having any part in it LUL
[1:57:41] <%Keyd00d> It hasn't even been a full year since Elden was announced, games take time
[1:57:49] <TheSlothCast> just make ER Souls paced instead of Bloodborne paced and Im a happy camper
[1:58:02] <+GeneralVicinity> is this regular DS3 or modded?
[1:58:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Other games come out a year after being announced.
[1:58:04] <%Bearphonics> It's that thios boss fight is literally one of the most interesting and original boss fights I've ever seen in a videogame
[1:58:05] <Scrummo> @awanderingkaivo yeah, that's what I was talking about. That's a cool addition, and thanks for the explanation :)
[1:58:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> @terminallyCapriciousz It was my first Souls game, but I really didn;t care for how repeptitive it was.
[1:58:08] <%xemnahort> Shouldn’t have announced til it was done
[1:58:16] <%Shackle_Rustyford> abyss watchers is probably my favorite fight in all 3 games
[1:58:20] <+GeneralVicinity> Man I was stuck on this for the longest time
[1:58:22] <+OwlLightningMage> @xemnahort Agreed
[1:58:26] <+encrouched> Sending all my energy to Paige's spirit bum
[1:58:29] <+fiiive> why did guys like German spy and plague of gripes hate this game on release. didnt he not even play it?
[1:58:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He was just trying to help you, Pat
[1:58:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @rumtumtugnutz unfortunately nostalgia hits everyone differently
[1:58:33] <%Keyd00d> Yeah, games should be announced closer to launch
[1:58:34] <cheapdoc> your turned him around
[1:58:35] <Aydarkzero> d e t h

[1:59:19] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:59:21] <TheSlothCast> admittedly hearing about Paper Mario like 3 months ago wouldnt have had an averse reaction for me

[1:59:28] <%nofestu2> You might say he has some gripes
[1:59:28] <%jaygee303> Has this boss really been made that much harder
[1:59:32] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:59:33] <Ciglossonjr> Plague is a baby piss baby boy piss
[1:59:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think Plague hates things because other people like them
[1:59:33] <%possumwalsh1221> Plague probably thought it was fan service
[1:59:33] <%cureneckbeard> he has gripes
[1:59:35] <%spiritofmojave> Plague is a little bit of a sourpuss
[1:59:36] <mostundesired> What???

[1:59:51] <TheSlothCast> Plague's gonna Plague
[1:59:52] <%Dr_Mooose> oof
[1:59:53] <worldbrand> is it because it did the least to fuck up its own lore?
[1:59:54] <Travmanic> Plague doesn't like things just varying degrees of hate

[2:00:11] <%Bearphonics> Plague love DS2, but he's too much of a coward to admit it
[2:00:12] <%Aleate> Plagues favorite thing in the world would be something he would like "by process of elimination"
[2:00:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PatStaresAt Franz was getting harrassed for not playing the game right, worse than you
[2:00:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @rumtumtugnutz i can't say anything, ROTS is my personal favorite of the 9 movies.
[2:00:15] <+ekodrop> not enough animals for plague to like

[2:00:50] <Calek> was he doing a blind DS3 playthrough with a double shield build
[2:00:50] <@commanderclaw> Youtube comments are cancer
[2:00:51] <%nofestu2> Im still mad
[2:00:52] <%PaladinDupre> Franz was playing the game left.
[2:00:53] <%Madbearv> Yelling at you in real time
[2:00:53] <Zombrocom> Did we
[2:00:58] <StealthlessFox> I like Franz, but his playthrough he jumped to conclusions on absolutely everything with anger
[2:00:58] <+encrouched> Blurst than me?
[2:01:03] <%Keyd00d> I forget youtube has comments
[2:01:03] <%heartlesshealer> we calmed down?????????
[2:01:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Mastery PogChamp
[2:01:07] <cheapdoc> they calmed down because they are afraid of telling it to your face in real time
[2:01:12] <RetroCop87> The twitch-only crowd got inundated with regular LP viewers, and somehow got less caustic as a result
[2:01:13] <Zombrocom> It's harder to talk shit when you can see and hear the person in real time, I think
[2:01:18] <Oxybe> For a moment i thought when you said Plague didn't like DS3 on release my monkey brain thought you said DS9 for a moment and it just farted, ie star trek. @patstaresat
[2:01:21] <%possumwalsh1221> Dark souls games brings out backseating worse than almost anything
[2:01:21] <huskarl_zap> Ok someone bring up kenny again to get chat hyped
[2:01:22] <+ALazo> Franz has some gripes of his own
[2:01:25] <Tucker0603> Franz is a great dude, helped me out a bit when I was depressed when my grandpa died
[2:01:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can't troll a streamer in twitch chat, because then mods ban you
[2:01:32] <%WackyGear> HEAL
[2:01:38] <CheekyBirb> other guy: you're welcome Kappa
[2:01:43] <%jaygee303> @cheapdoc That’s what the reddits for
[2:01:45] <$lotharrio> Oh no, someone called me a coward... must get louder and angrier at Pat! HOLY SHIT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
[2:01:48] <mostundesired> It's more like we can yell at you directly instead of at the void, so it's not as infuriating.
[2:01:49] <+Promessa_EX> ds2 pvp'ers are impressive
[2:01:50] <%starotter70> Maybe it's just that, if you say some shit, someone can tell you to fuck off IN REAL TIME
[2:01:50] <%Aleate> Red eye! ruuD
[2:01:55] <%xemnahort> I bet spy held the sword backwards
[2:01:56] <ShimmerFairy> Maybe they calmed down because the anxiety of knowing the advice won't kick in until the next session, if you see it at all, is gone?
[2:02:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's probably going to be a chest at some point in the next hour or so of gameplay
[2:02:05] <+Promessa_EX> this guy waited for about 10 minutes to soul arrow me
[2:02:05] <%DJTanaka> Ooh man. Went to shower. Pat still at it?
[2:02:11] <+Promessa_EX> in the back
[2:02:20] <%FacetiousAF> we yell TOGETHER and not isolated as one comment at a time or starting a comment thread
[2:02:21] <+encrouched> Cos real time Pat too scawy
[2:02:21] <%spiritofmojave> @djtanaka yep we at 10 deaths now
[2:02:22] <huskarl_zap> Walking dead 1 was their only good game
[2:02:22] <%Keyd00d> Yeah when you say dumb shit in chat streamer can call you out immediately
[2:02:34] <%DJTanaka> @spiritofmojave Shit, 10? Damn.
[2:02:38] <%Keyd00d> It'll happen to yooouuuuu
[2:02:42] <%DappercatEsquire> I thought we were at 12 deaths
[2:02:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Keyd00d Happens tto me here more often than I'd like!
[2:02:54] <%TheWinged7> whoa green flash
[2:02:55] <%Aleate> Why's this guy gotta be so fucking cool
[2:02:58] <%starotter70> I feel like I just saw some shit
[2:03:03] <%spiritofmojave> it very well might be 12 lmao
[2:03:10] <%YakumoYomi> We are both more hype and more horny than any Youtube comments section!
[2:03:13] <%heartlesshealer> F
[2:03:13] <%TheREALGirthMan> +1
[2:03:14] <+Redpointshine> +1 DEATH COUNT 13
[2:03:14] <+fiiive> what do u hate about ds3 compared to the others. just started my first run @patstaresat
[2:03:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I didn't watch Spy's DS3 run, but it was bad enough that it bled into his Persona 4 Golden playthough
[2:03:17] <$lotharrio> Man, why DOES that third Abyss Watcher start killing his friends?
[2:03:17] <%dekkitout> Oh wow, it's Lady Maria's reincarnation
[2:03:17] <+OwlLightningMage> It's just Nero under the mask with a permanent Max Act LUL
[2:03:17] <%FacetiousAF> fire def?
[2:03:21] <+encrouched> Music slow down always tilts me
[2:03:26] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat I uh don't think this build is great for the abyss boys
[2:03:26] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> just grab the boulder
[2:03:26] <j0ustar> Pat got the bad touch right there
[2:03:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> How long until this stream becomes PatSwearsAt>
[2:03:30] <Scrummo> summon Plague to draw lewd Abyss Watchers. It will demoralize them.
[2:03:31] <+GeneralVicinity> I spammed all my firebombs for this boss
[2:03:31] <%heartlesshealer> shield smol
[2:03:33] <%Aleate> Just parry it 4Head
[2:03:35] <PKHTjim> K' with a sword.
[2:03:38] <%spiritofmojave> Boulder tech time
[2:03:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> you have enough seeds for boulder yeah
[2:03:46] <%DJTanaka> You got this, Pat!
[2:03:48] <roobanguy> try using the quick step ring and a greatsword against him
[2:03:50] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt they have 20% dark resistance and 0% normal, try the Blue Blood
[2:03:52] <rafaelba93> parry!
[2:03:52] <%arcaderabbit48> The worst part ios that this awesome boss has a second phase it doesnt need
[2:03:54] <roobanguy> that worked well for me
[2:03:57] <%YakumoYomi> You might want to branch out into other magic types
[2:03:57] <%xemnahort> Stream delay told me about the death almost a minute before it happened
[2:03:59] <Archer27> I hate this run to the boss so much because of my sl1 file.
[2:04:02] <+TheBitingIrish> 'legit'
[2:04:08] <PanicSwytch> Its only fitting that artorias's watchers have an awesome soundtrack and fight
[2:04:09] <Monkeyweed21> Pat your candlestick can cast pyromancies
[2:04:13] <%possumwalsh1221> Why would you beat him legit this is dark souls
[2:04:13] <rafaelba93> parry with buckler
[2:04:14] <%Archphronimos> hit them until they die Pat, you can do it maybe
[2:04:16] <+encrouched> Summon jesus
[2:04:18] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> attempt parry at roll attacks he does
[2:04:18] <%dekkitout> 40k Souls sounds like an epic ass crossover
[2:04:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> @arcaderabbit48 That's an issue I find with a lot of Dark Souls bosses.
[2:04:25] <roobanguy> they have -10% pierce resist too
[2:04:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Oh
[2:04:27] <+GeneralVicinity> anyone know the lore behind these sneaky bois?
[2:04:29] <TheSlothCast> I never understood the appeal of things like SL1 runs
[2:04:30] <%weissguard> Well, they're Artorias inspired. Not strictly his.
[2:04:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> Who would have thought the dudes who guard against darkness are resistant to darkness Kappa
[2:04:31] <%TheWinged7> STINGER
[2:04:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> I get it, they can be fun, but sometimes that shit TEDiOUS
[2:04:40] <%weissguard> *IIRC
[2:04:46] <%patriotrenegade> whoa its crazy that this boss who fought the Dark as a job is resistant against dark
[2:04:50] <Aydarkzero> magic is lame slash at your enemies
[2:04:54] <%arcaderabbit48> @rumtumtugnutz Pretty much. DS3 feels the most grating, but there are few Souls bosses that really needed that Phase 2
[2:04:55] <+TheBitingIrish> @TheREALGirthMan The armor has super low dark resist tho
[2:05:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think my favorite 2 phase boss was Ludwig
[2:05:03] <mostundesired> @GeneralVicinity Are the Abyss Watchers the sneaky bois?
[2:05:04] <Aydarkzero> @patriotrenegade Kappa
[2:05:04] <%weissguard> I cast SWORD TO YOUR BACK!
[2:05:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> but what if you MAGICALLY slash at your enemies
[2:05:06] <Frostydough1> Yo its those guys that watch
[2:05:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait are you saying the Abyss WAtchers can resist the... ABYSS?! NANI?!
[2:05:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You could be like Hob and try to beat Dark souls 1, 2, 3, Demons souls, bloodborne and Sekiro, consecutively, without being hit
[2:05:19] <+GeneralVicinity> @mostundesired yea cuz they got daggers
[2:05:22] <%TheWinged7> drop your shield pat
[2:05:23] <Travmanic> Abyss fight club is so cool
[2:05:27] <$lotharrio> @GeneralVicinity You mean the Watchers? they're some sort of knight order that made a pact with a kickass undead wolf to prevent weird abyss-monsters from getting uppity.
[2:05:27] <+TheBitingIrish> @Frostydough1 Voyeurs?
[2:05:28] <+encrouched> Now imagine the Manus watchers
[2:05:31] <%YakumoYomi> Synchronized AW fight club
[2:05:34] <%xemnahort> If you aggro the watcher that helps you, you kill him, and he gets back up, will he still be aggroed?
[2:05:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> listen are bird watchers resistant to birds? nope
[2:05:34] <Aydarkzero> imagine resisting the Abyss LUL
[2:05:41] <roobanguy> i fucking love the lore around the blue blood sword
[2:05:45] <+TheBitingIrish> Stabby stabby
[2:05:46] <%starotter70> This is the run Kappa
[2:05:47] <+GeneralVicinity> WOOOOOO CONGRATS PAT
[2:05:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Good run PogChamp
[2:05:50] <%FacetiousAF> imagine petting Sif
[2:05:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @lotharrio Wait, the wolf is undead? How does that work if it isnt human??
[2:05:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NO I WANNA LISTEN TO THE MUSIC MORE
[2:05:52] <worldbrand> this fight was one of those ones where by the time i beat them i felt like i could do it again 4 times in a row
[2:05:54] <%CrookedSpiral> power in diversity
[2:05:59] <mostundesired> @GeneralVicinity Short version, bunch of Artorias fanboys who zealously fight the abyss. They linked the flame, then became lords of cinder, only to be corrupted with the abyss, so they're constantly fighting each other. Then you show up.
[2:05:59] <%possumwalsh1221> Get ready to hit that shit choir lady
[2:06:00] <Aydarkzero> @FacetiousAF FeelsBadMan
[2:06:02] <+encrouched> Get smoked Abby
[2:06:10] <$lotharrio> I don't think it's properly undead. Just undying or something.
[2:06:10] <+GeneralVicinity> oh shit i forgot about this part
[2:06:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> makes sense the Abyss watchers have Dark Resist
[2:06:36] <+OwlLightningMage> YEYEYEYE PogChamp
[2:06:39] <+encrouched> Got a little back pain
[2:06:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> same fore Aldrich and Yorm as well
[2:06:41] <$sniffy77> PAT PAT HE'S OUR MAN! IF HE CAN'T DO IT SOLAIRE CAN!
[2:06:47] <$lotharrio> Like it is dead, but it seems to still have power, authority and so on.
[2:06:51] <%Aleate> ruuS
[2:06:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, it would be cool if infusing the Farron Greatsword with fire made the blade look like this
[2:06:53] <%DJTanaka> BITE 'EM.
[2:06:56] <%starotter70> MonkaS
[2:06:58] <%PaladinDupre> They have 40% fire res, 20% to all other elements, 0% for all normal damage types
[2:06:58] <Aydarkzero> i find it funny Yhorm is weak to Lightning
[2:07:12] <roobanguy> he really doesnt want you to backstab him pat
[2:07:13] <%DensityD> hard hard hard hard hard
[2:07:14] <$lotharrio> Call in Solaire!
[2:07:15] <+GeneralVicinity> I used his soul to craft the sword so i can parry with the greatsword moves
[2:07:16] <PanicSwytch> Pat must become darkness. Join the Abyss
[2:07:18] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat keeps panic dodging every time it rushes at him
[2:07:24] <%xemnahort> Aren’t giants always weak to lightning?
[2:07:27] <%Fooguwu> prepare for die
[2:07:31] <+OwlLightningMage> The power of Max Acts are too strong
[2:07:32] <TheSlothCast> did the Abyss Watchers change much from this mod? It seems the same to me\
[2:07:34] <jhonxiolonn> Drop your shield, Pa
[2:07:35] <%korth367> you have to hit him woolie
[2:07:36] <jhonxiolonn> t
[2:07:37] <thebestestkevin> @Valentinius_Anodyne theres an item here where you can have the look of a buff on a weapon
[2:07:41] <%spiritofmojave> you have to attack Woolie
[2:07:43] <worldbrand> you can doing it
[2:07:44] <thebestestkevin> so you can get the fire farron sword
[2:07:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> s p e e d
[2:07:47] <Zombrocom> Fights the same, just got a bunch more health
[2:07:47] <%TheREALGirthMan> You have to HIT him, Pat
[2:07:51] <Aydarkzero> Giants weakness keep changing i believe
[2:07:54] <$paprikaei> actually using a shield after beating your first souls game omegaKek
[2:07:55] <%jaygee303> When did using embers become considered cheating
[2:07:56] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat. You have to HIT him.
[2:08:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @thebestestkevin Ooh, rad

[2:15:24] <Scrummo> don't forget to do the Cathedral of the Deep. You need that doll to continue past the Crypt.
[2:15:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Mdub98 only reason to play portable is to play as the female MC
[2:15:25] <+TheBitingIrish> I skipped through those 100 2.1 quests, so when HE passed I thought, 'Who?'

[2:21:48] <%jamesvdv12> Pat is this mod just a beefed up ng+ or would it be good for first-timers?
[2:21:53] <+TheBitingIrish> So?
[2:21:55] <+senro1> OHHO
[2:21:55] <Travmanic> These appear to be some kind of skeleton fight-men
[2:21:56] <%PaladinDupre> pyromancy has no scaling
[2:21:56] <VultsTV> boulder does as much damage as great chaos fire orb according to the wiki
[2:21:56] <%starotter70> THIS IS MY ANAL VOLCANO JUTSU, DATTEBAYO!
[2:21:58] <+TheBitingIrish> It's not fire 4Head
[2:21:58] <mostundesired> Pyromancy uses the same stats as dark, what are you talking about?
[2:22:00] <+senro1> you are approaching me ?????
[2:22:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Patrat used Rock Throw
[2:22:06] <%SpicyCheeseNips> no
[2:22:07] <DXLelouch24> @jamesvdv12 beat vanilla first
[2:22:12] <%xemnahort> Party skeletons have a big weakness which is unlocking and using side swipes
[2:22:12] <+major_dude> no
[2:22:16] <+TheBitingIrish> All hexers are pyromancers and vice-versa
[2:22:17] <+Infernal_Dalek> The earthbenders a naturally proficient in crushing skeletons
[2:22:18] <+masked_hero_lucky> Sticks and stone will break their bones
[2:22:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> pyro scales with the same stats though
[2:22:19] <%xemnahort> *parry
[2:22:19] <%Aydarkzero> think Scholar of the First sin
[2:22:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No, but you can totally do NG+ from the beginning
[2:22:26] <Scrummo> it's really just for pancaking, that Boulder Heave. One heck of a guardbreaker, too.
[2:22:27] <LSpiral> pyromancy scales with the same stats as dark spells, pat
[2:22:30] <Monkeyweed21> Its a super easy bitch mode for babies
[2:22:35] <BlacSoul> Vanilla First, then you get dessert
[2:22:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Pyro and dark have the same scaling as dark
[2:22:44] <%xemnahort> Pyro scales from int or faith whichever is weaker
[2:22:46] <mostundesired> Dink more.
[2:22:49] <%YakumoYomi> Being a hexer means you're basically stat'd for pyromancy
[2:22:50] <+Prism_Wing> wall
[2:22:52] <%PaladinDupre> @TheBitingIrish you can use pyromancy without int or fth tho
[2:22:55] <%MechArch> try boulder against skellyball
[2:23:00] <%jamesvdv12> I just beat that vanilla stuff just thinking if its worth doing ng+ or doing this instead
[2:23:08] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt think you'll take a look at that massive terraria patch?
[2:23:10] <%xemnahort> @paladindupre not in ds3 you can’t
[2:23:10] <%TheSniperJoe> SKELETON WARRIORS DUN DUN DUN
[2:23:21] <+TheBitingIrish> @PaladinDupre No, because it scales from the weaker one

[2:23:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The real Skeleton Ball was the friends we made along the way
[2:23:50] <%PaladinDupre> I through a giant fireball with sub 10 in both stats and did 500+
[2:23:50] <+TheBitingIrish> @PatStaresAt Well Pat, when a mommy skeleton ball and a daddy skeleton ball love each other very much....
[2:23:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Imagine seeping your soul in the deep, dark Abyss and manifesting the physical embodiment of human weight and suffering in your spells, and then having people say "set stuff on fire tho."
[2:23:53] <%Fooguwu> and lost :(
[2:24:00] <%xemnahort> @paladindupre in ds3 pyromancies have int/faith requirements
[2:24:01] <+masked_hero_lucky> *Skeleton Warriors plays in the distance*
[2:24:07] <%ForlornCarton> Pat, will you try XCOM Chimera Squade again now that it has a patch?
[2:24:10] <%starotter70> Man, I've lost like 20hrs to terraria in the past few days
[2:24:13] <%PaladinDupre> @xemnahort well not in cinders
[2:24:16] <%Shackle_Rustyford> *distant guitar squeelies*

[2:24:30] <thehighdrated1> We all instinctively go to "Skeleton BALL" don't we?
[2:24:38] <%xemnahort> @paladindupre ah I see then we should tell pat
[2:24:45] <+sutikshna123> @sutikshna123 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:24:45] <Oxybe> Patminal Crossing when?
[2:24:47] <TheSlothCast> I wish I could summon Skeleton Balls :(
[2:24:49] <%heartlesshealer> we're just really hype for skeleton ball
[2:24:50] <EMP_Ike_Turner> The skeleton ball is too powerful
[2:24:50] <Novapulsus> @starotter70 Me too man, me too.
[2:24:52] <%xemnahort> @thehighdrated1 it’s the best choice
[2:24:54] <+masked_hero_lucky> Of course, it's one of the best parts of the DS3 LP
[2:24:55] <%dekkitout> Yes- all roads end at Skeleton Ball
[2:24:55] <%jamesvdv12> Does this mod make the game easier or is pat just a BEAST
[2:24:57] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Was there an unopened chest back there?
[2:25:10] <+Erimos> @SpicyCheeseNips it was opened. It was the Grant.
[2:25:23] <%heartlesshealer> skeleton ball is the best thing since psycho crusher skeleton
[2:25:23] <%Fooguwu> really teasing our skeleton balls here Pat
[2:25:28] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @Erimos No I saw that, I thought I saw another one
[2:25:31] <mostundesired> @jamesvdv12 Total rebalance, it's easier to go through levels, but the challenging bits will wreck you harder.
[2:25:36] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt Cinders removed the FTH and INT requirements and scaling for Pyromancy, its all about the spell tool level and they work like they did in 1
[2:25:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bolder :)
[2:25:37] <%possumwalsh1221> Do you know how much skeleton must have practiced to drift that wheel that good
[2:25:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder was always good
[2:25:38] <LSpiral> cinders wiki says pyromancy gets 20% of the max spell buff up front and then scales the remaining 80% with faith and int equally
[2:25:40] <BlacSoul> Good ass hit boxes
[2:25:41] <%Typhaeon> Rock wizard
[2:25:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I cast Rock
[2:25:44] <RetributionP> pat rocks are blunt.
[2:25:45] <$lotharrio> @jamesvdv12 From what Pat said, it's mostly that it makes more builds viable. So it's less likely for you to mess up in that aspect.
[2:25:46] <%TheWinged7> its almost as if one guy was right this time

[2:29:00] <mostundesired> @jamesvdv12 You're right about that. It's up to you if you think it's better, but this encourages you to actually go through the level more than just sprinting to the boss. Plus, bosses are generally harder, so there's that.
[2:29:03] <Scrummo> cool
[2:29:09] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Thats how I felt about pyros when I wanted to use lightning spears

[2:31:38] <%starotter70> Denizens of the Mustard Herald
[2:31:39] <+encrouched> Turd survives the flush? Tough shit
[2:31:42] <%dekkitout> Fifteen steps in and Paige might drown from all the skeletons
[2:31:43] <%TheFabledAble> BOULDER
[2:31:48] <mostundesired> It's treason then.
[2:31:53] <%WhereIsWill> masaka!?
[2:31:59] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Sploosh
[2:32:04] <%SirGO0SE> he didnt gave up :)
[2:32:04] <worldbrand> man that shit is like Hock a Loogie lvl 8
[2:32:06] <Monkeyweed21> whats your favorite race from the Endless games? Im playing as the mushroom wierdos in Endless Legend rn and enjoying covering the map in fungus spooge
[2:32:08] <%heartlesshealer> the ds1 skeletons are fucking dope
[2:32:16] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't give up, skeleton!
[2:32:21] <Heyestus> DS12 skellies don't twirl around like that, I don't think.
[2:32:31] <%SpicyCheeseNips> What's Endless?
[2:32:34] <Midnight188> @Monkeyweed21 best Endless Legend race is Broken Lords. Doshlords are top freaking tier. Love them.
[2:32:35] <Heyestus> maybe the models are lifted
[2:32:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Endless Space
[2:32:40] <+Erimos> My favorite skeleton is the one in the pot of lava from DS2.
[2:32:41] <whittacre> I looooove the cultists in EL
[2:32:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I tried Endless Legends but I hated the concept of a round capped game
[2:32:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @SpicyCheeseNips Endless Legend and Endless Space, assumedly
[2:32:51] <mostundesired> Get rocked.
[2:33:00] <+encrouched> Bold
[2:33:03] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> UwU
[2:33:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't WANNA get where I go in 100 rounds, I want to get as far as I can go PERIOD
[2:33:11] <BurdRightsActivist> VERTEBRA SHEKELS PogChamp
[2:33:11] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt I did some digging and it seems like Dreg Torrent is bad because it does partial curse damage which isnt usesul in PvE. Try the Dark Pyromancy Equivalent, you get the tome for it in this zone.
[2:33:23] <+Pharmakokinetic> I've literally never done anything other than a melee build but now that I've started Cinders and seeing this maybe I should respec that looks fun
[2:33:25] <%heartlesshealer> you thought you could shield the multi-hit-box of wheel
[2:33:29] <%jamesvdv12> will you play endless 2 again on stream that was one of my fav streams v mellow
[2:33:31] <%AncelDeLambert> also I felt the combat was poorly balanced, that too
[2:33:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> Endless Legends is round capped? I never knew that, only played a tiny bit
[2:33:36] <%xemnahort> So how are pure miracle builds in cinders?
[2:33:36] <j0ustar> You need to play more Endless Space Pat you're missing a good game
[2:33:40] <+encrouched> Wheel and deal significant damage
[2:33:42] <%AncelDeLambert> dat a stone
[2:33:44] <%starotter70> For some reason, I can't stop thinking about 2D Soulsvania style game but it'd be made by Vanillaware
[2:33:47] <%PaladinDupre> arrow
[2:33:48] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Is dark
[2:33:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> I always bounce right off civ style strategy games
[2:33:50] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Gavlan?
[2:33:50] <CheekyBirb> you did, but you got shot by an arrow and forgot
[2:33:52] <$demegodz> blind
[2:33:53] <Monkeyweed21> @Midnight188 after the slow early game, you biggest problem is having too much money to spend lol. Alphonse Elric Lords are best bois
[2:33:55] <%heartlesshealer> You were distracted by singular arrow
[2:33:55] <%SpicyCheeseNips> YEYEYYE FAVORITE ARMOR
[2:33:57] <Gabbycat> YUH
[2:33:58] <%Madbearv> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:33:59] <+encrouched> Pladin
[2:34:00] <%FacetiousAF> how good's that shield tho
[2:34:00] <%brackboi> didnt even check
[2:34:04] <CherrieVelvet> you went for the chest but archer distracted you
[2:34:14] <%AncelDeLambert> man, I'd be playing this right now if it weren't for me being in the middle of a MonHun kick
[2:34:20] <Calek> I need to do an intelligence build, Sister Friede cosplay demands it
[2:34:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @starotter70 I dunno if it's what you're looking for, but are you familiar with Salt and Sanctuary?
[2:34:24] <%FacetiousAF> sleeby
[2:34:28] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @FacetiousAF It as innate health regen, but physical reduction starts at 90
[2:34:29] <%luftraumm1> luftraumm1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! hey pat you feeling more at home in a familiar game? your last forays into RTS seemed to have bummed you out a bit. hope everything is alright with you and the other Pslots of love
[2:34:29] <%AncelDeLambert> the controls in MonHun are the direct opposite to the controls in DS, it's fucked
[2:34:32] <mostundesired> Don't give up skeleton!
[2:34:35] <%moogleboy1984> c'mon PSYCHO CRUSHER
[2:34:35] <+Hoonbaba_Woods> Just showed up, Pat felt like a revisit?
[2:34:38] <Broand> I feel like this way of playing the game is like cheesing
[2:34:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Hoonbaba_Woods modded
[2:34:43] <%HRDSalami654> He commin'!
[2:34:44] <+encrouched> Paladin is fine but wheres my PLAD armour
[2:34:47] <Midnight188> sksleton ball?
[2:34:49] <%xemnahort> I mean the check is fairly visible on that chest so checking isn’t necessary... unless cinders changes the mimic mechanic
[2:34:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Don't give up skeleton
[2:34:53] <%Keyd00d> @Hoonbaba_Woods It's a rehaul mod
[2:34:56] <%xemnahort> *the chain
[2:34:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Theres also a chest on the drop down to the right of the bonfire
[2:35:00] <+Hoonbaba_Woods> @Sphincter_Spelunker Ah yes im an idiot, didnt read title
[2:35:00] <%FacetiousAF> @SpicyCheeseNips i mean.. if it starts with the paladin class that sounds fine
[2:35:06] <%heartlesshealer> 👏👏👏👏👏👏
[2:35:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no worries
[2:35:09] <mostundesired> Wait, did Pat never find out how to kill the skeleton ball?
[2:35:09] <%WhereIsWill> it's not fair that skelemans get a damn psycho crusher
[2:35:11] <%PaladinDupre> @encrouched i know I'm fine baby
[2:35:15] <jhonxiolonn> look behind the corner after that entrance
[2:35:17] <+OwlLightningMage> Make Love to the skeleton ball
[2:35:23] <+encrouched> You cannot reroll
[2:35:24] <%starotter70> @Valentinius_Anodyne Close enough, all that's missing are the big anime tiddos
[2:35:24] <+Erimos> Don't give up, Skeleton Ball.
[2:35:26] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @FacetiousAF It does not, in fact

[2:36:07] <%heartlesshealer> Hat man was pilot of ball
[2:36:07] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @FacetiousAF You do start with a holy infused weapon which gives you health regen tho
[2:36:09] <%TheWinged7> he is the owner of skeleton balls
[2:36:10] <%Keyd00d> He controls the spices
[2:36:15] <jhonxiolonn> Only that one
[2:36:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> uh huh
[2:36:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @starotter70 Oho, true enough, but it is worth checking

[2:41:26] <%YakumoYomi> Is this the BACK DOWN?!
[2:41:29] <%SpicyCheeseNips> what
[2:41:29] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> is just that the mid-game for mages sucks
[2:41:29] <roobanguy> i believe in u pat
[2:41:30] <+MooonKira> man watching pat eat shit makes me miss eating shit ds3 is too easy, im getting this mod
[2:41:30] <%possumwalsh1221> That just means you get gooder
[2:41:32] <%PaladinDupre> THERE IS A WAY PAT \[T]/
[2:41:33] <%cylish> Remember when people were whining about it being too easy?
[2:41:33] <%Billyuppercut0> Pat no
[2:41:37] <rafaelba93> even wolnir is beefier
[2:41:40] <%SirGO0SE> sbfpSetIn
[2:41:41] <%SpicyCheeseNips> b-but PAAAAAAT
[2:41:41] <FalseKingAki> oh no, guess you'll have to go back to P5, oh well
[2:41:42] <%WhereIsWill> you gotta make it to the castlesuperbeast!
[2:41:42] <%spiritofmojave> but what if you did tho, imagine
[2:41:44] <%Ynkubus18> P5R back?
[2:41:44] <%heartlesshealer> just grind offstream
[2:41:46] <+encrouched> Run souls
[2:41:48] <+ekodrop> but it's super easy
[2:41:51] <%jamesvdv12> at least get to the nameless king dawg
[2:41:52] <PrimordialDonut> my biggest problem with the mod is that bosses feel like they have too much health
[2:41:53] <+Xanadeas> does pat know about the shortcut?
[2:41:54] <%Taengoo31> but p5r died for this
[2:41:57] <%xemnahort> Did pat forget about the shortcut
[2:41:59] <%possumwalsh1221> Pat’s second stand nobody remembers, backdown
[2:42:05] <Calek> you could just summon solaire and dunk on some of these encounters
[2:42:08] <$lotharrio> Don't give up, Skeleton!
[2:42:08] <%SirGO0SE> nameless is like the end of the game tho LUL @jamesvdv12
[2:42:12] <%SirGO0SE> unless the mod is different?
[2:42:13] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, I'm gonna assume you don't remember the shortcut to the right of the bonfire, right?
[2:42:16] <roobanguy> do you have the undead damage ring?
[2:42:18] <+encrouched> PUT ON THE COWARD RING
[2:42:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Are we leaving game's unfinished like Paige now
[2:42:21] <%dekkitout> He has access to Nameless King
[2:42:25] <%WhereIsWill> at least get to slave knight Gael pat Kappa
[2:42:35] <%Billyuppercut0> I wish I had a working computer so I could play this
[2:42:37] <vinceshamwowslap> my dark souls skills are rusty ):
[2:42:38] <%luftraumm1> that tracking overhead in the spell tho
[2:42:39] <Chimeraelite> I like the boss HP change, but I get why some people wouldn't. You can't power through boss fights anymore so you gotta suffer through the entire moveset and unironically get really good at rolling through shti
[2:42:41] <%PaladinDupre> SKIP THIS PART BY GOING RIGHT AT THE BONFIRE
[2:42:43] <vonmaultke> you can fight Nameless as your second boss
[2:42:44] <%SpicyCheeseNips> uhyup

[3:39:16] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he's gonna do donation reads once he gets back

[3:40:14] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE IS PATO CHAN
[3:40:16] <%dekkitout> Skeletons have to be fictional- cause aint no way baby skull xrays are real

[3:40:53] <%spiritofmojave> we all know babies are just ayyliens
[3:41:00] <+Erimos> Skeletons are too cool to be real.
[3:41:12] <dinnydanny777> At some point in their life cycle alien babies are replaced with adult human beings
[3:41:19] <dinnydanny777> These are facts
[3:41:23] <%jamesvdv12> u gonna stream Endless 2 again?

[3:42:00] <dinnydanny777> Hammer the war
[3:42:01] <Baeltyr> idk why you get so anxious about your units in TW
[3:42:01] <%weissguard> You'll never be a regular human as long as you do streaming for a living.
[3:42:05] <%starotter70> That's fine, I don't know what a Warhammer even is
[3:42:06] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt Smash 'em to bits

[3:42:09] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt don't worry Pat, we won't be any help!
[3:42:11] <+Lost_Zombie> Pat is intimidated by cooking
[3:42:12] <%TaterBurglar> Reject your humanity
[3:42:12] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt did u do the tomestone event in 14 already?
[3:42:14] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt I hope tomorrows stream goes well! Just take it as it goes
[3:42:28] <Baeltyr> not judging, jsut genuinely dont understand
[3:42:29] <jimmytwofeet> YOU HAVE RETURNED TO US
[3:42:29] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt Don't worry. Chat will help you!
[3:42:38] <huskarl_zap> Do you know how to make control groups?
[3:42:39] <Baeltyr> yea he has a ton of buffs to goblins
[3:42:44] <@SoFarFetched> Chat will probably be yelling at Pat,in a good and bad way.
[3:42:48] <+Shacklebox> sacrifice the gobbos, use da trolls
[3:42:48] <Neo_Kaiser> Ask Mandalore
[3:42:48] <Oxybe> chat will """"help""""
[3:42:50] <$Piemono> His gobbo's are really strong though
[3:42:52] <%TaterBurglar> I actually went and played the beginning, you can just walk back into Orc Massif and recruit some Orcs
[3:42:58] <Zombrocom> He has a ton of buffs for goblins, he can make gobbos super big and strong
[3:43:01] <%starotter70> Haven't seen it yet, but the OST is AMAZING
[3:43:06] <zamzoph> Send more goblins
[3:43:09] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt Dude, the trolls are great and Grom can stand in melee with infantry and be fine
[3:43:11] <+Shacklebox> yeah they're expendable
[3:43:17] <derap41> Did you send them in aone?
[3:43:18] <+Erimos> Juice your goblins more.
[3:43:19] <SGrim> Did you use the hero buffs or cooking mechanic?
[3:43:22] <%GarbageNirvana> MEOW
[3:43:23] <Oxybe> MROW
[3:43:24] <%dekkitout> Not even one lived?
[3:43:25] <huskarl_zap> Trolls do all the damage really
[3:43:26] <Monkeyweed21> exactly
[3:43:28] <dipstere> Groms actual good strong starting units are his chariots which need huge amounts of micro
[3:43:30] <%VashyronM> Gobbos are meant to die
[3:43:31] <Baeltyr> yes, he is a faction that uses a lot of expendable units
[3:43:31] <%MisterRockett> Did you send them against the units they'd be affective against?
[3:43:32] <+Shacklebox> yeah they're alll expendable
[3:43:36] <Zombrocom> The trolls and grom do the work while the goblins die
[3:43:37] <%TaterBurglar> Gobbos get stronger over the course of the campaign
[3:43:42] <%ssjklyco> "Blank is strong only if you do these specific manuevers perfectly."
[3:43:44] <Oxybe> He butts and screm
[3:43:55] <%dekkitout> Like first as in tutorial?
[3:43:57] <derap41> Did you play legendary?
[3:43:58] <$Piemono> essentially use gobbos to hold line with trolls and cycle charge with Grom and chariots
[3:44:01] <Zombrocom> Pump wagons are actually fine in melee
[3:44:03] <Monkeyweed21> They are meats to throw into the grinder, not people
[3:44:04] <Baeltyr> the pumpo wagons do well im melee
[3:44:04] <Neo_Kaiser> RTS games are just an elaborate game of Rick, Paper, Scissors.
[3:44:05] <dinnydanny777> Did you try not dying?
[3:44:09] <Baeltyr> pump*
[3:44:09] <Neo_Kaiser> rock
[3:44:14] <%VashyronM> Throw the gobbos in and the sweep the sides with trolls and Grom
[3:44:15] <+D00msDayDan> just git gud lmaoeoauw
[3:44:17] <%terminallyCapriciousz> chat is super just not understanding
[3:44:23] <%Fooguwu> did you try using bolder heave?
[3:44:23] <huskarl_zap> Hold shift and draw a line behind the enemies when they engage to rear charge with cav or chariots
[3:44:25] <%jamesvdv12> they give debuffs v underratted
[3:44:26] <+Shacklebox> ok, add the hag to your army and throw your goblins at them. forget about them, get everything else to punch things in the back
[3:44:27] <Zombrocom> Did you put the troll hero in your army?
[3:44:30] <SGrim> Pat, you're supposed to run from that fight!
[3:44:30] <%TaterBurglar> Pat you can march your army back to Orc Massif, recruit like 5 Orc Boyz and 1 Gobbo Archer over two turns, than fight the Bretonnians, much easier that way
[3:44:35] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE IS THAT HAND SCRATCHING
[3:44:37] <%R3Roundabout> Then don't fight
[3:44:40] <%TheStarbecue> i like when cat appear
[3:44:42] <derap41> If you played on anything but normal battle difficulty don't
[3:44:44] <+Shacklebox> goblins are fire and forget

[3:44:59] <Zombrocom> You don't run from it, you can totally win
[3:44:59] <%VashyronM> You are not suppose to run from that fight
[3:45:00] <$Piemono> You can win it
[3:45:02] <%jamesvdv12> u need to rush ur orc units and overwhelm the enemy units
[3:45:03] <+Shacklebox> it's asylum demon, do it if you're good
[3:45:04] <%corgispudmen> you cant fight every battle
[3:45:04] <dinnydanny777> Is this one of those strategy games where you can just build 50 archer towers?
[3:45:07] <%TaterBurglar> You can totally run from that fight
[3:45:13] <SGrim> Gobblins = Cowards. Run til you're super strong.

[3:45:28] <Monkeyweed21> you're supposed to see how outmatched you are, retreat, then build up your army and come back AKA strategy
[3:45:28] <%starotter70> Tomorrow's gonna be a trip
[3:45:29] <RushUnplugged> You're supposed to BOTH run and NOT run from it at the same time, #strategy
[3:45:30] <%jamesvdv12> def not u take huge retreat penalties
[3:45:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Did we just end cause when I looked for stream earlier it wasnt there :(
[3:45:38] <+Shacklebox> treat it like asylum demon, do it if you're good or get some orcs first

[3:45:42] <Baeltyr> @TaterBurglar yes you, CAN, but it is not the point of that army to be ru naway from

[3:45:46] <SGrim> @Zombrocom you can, but you don't have to. Running is easier.

[3:48:35] <Baeltyr> easier*
[3:48:36] <%Aydarkzero> but i still enjoy it
[3:48:39] <dinnydanny777> Is it Dark Souls 2 hard where the game just floods you with enemies for most of the bosses?
[3:48:40] <+lazygertt> Ds3 is easiest but so much fun
[3:48:42] <0rond> nameless king and the DLC is super difficult though
[3:48:42] <%jamesvdv12> ds2 is the hardest it was awful
[3:48:43] <%Diana869> well that comes with familiarity pat
[3:48:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[3:48:43] <%PlagueOfGripes> requires more active energy but has an easier ceiling
[3:48:51] <Duskers> There's certain bosses that are really tough, like Nameless, but the game as a whole is definitely the easiest

[3:49:56] <+D00msDayDan> dwarf fortress but sci-fi
[3:49:57] <Baeltyr> play kenshi Kappa
[3:49:58] <%SirGO0SE> it's dwarf fortress babbies
[3:50:01] <dinnydanny777> It's a world on a rim
[3:50:03] <%snackcanary> same
[3:50:04] <TwinBat> it's dorffort for casuals
[3:50:05] <%heartlesshealer> a dwarf fortress
[3:50:06] <%ImFlippinOut> the Workin Man streamer
[3:50:07] <Baeltyr> its like rimworld for grownups Kappa
[3:50:08] <dinnydanny777> It's a rim world
[3:50:11] <CasualAlohaFriday> Simulation strategy
[3:50:14] <%Valdorick> That is correct, Pat.
[3:50:15] <$Piemono> Isn't Rimworld like Space Dwarf Fortress
[3:50:16] <%SirGO0SE> if vinny vinesauce could beat it on his first try you can
[3:50:17] <huskarl_zap> Hey hey people
[3:50:25] <%DappercatEsquire> Dwarf Fortress is watching everything you love die and enjoying it
[3:50:26] <+mrredwednesday> BBoomer Clap
[3:50:28] <%MechArch> sounds like butt stuff
[3:50:29] <Jontman42> they're goblin games
[3:50:32] <whittacre> you plan buildings and let the people build them
[3:50:36] <%Valdorick> Its a game where you make shrines to assholes while an AI hates you.
[3:50:36] <dinnydanny777> It's a rimworld
[3:50:36] <%heartlesshealer> You're not SUPPOSED to understand Dwarf Fortress. It's a feeling
[3:50:37] <derap41> Its a space colony simulator
[3:50:38] <ShichiNoBushi> You control a colony and give orders to your people to build things.
[3:50:39] <Futurecity10> rimworld isnt complicated, just hard
[3:50:41] <Oxybe> your team of 3 psycho malcontents crash on a planet and you have to dwarf fortress to survive.
[3:50:43] <jhonxiolonn> you just need to get used to them
[3:50:46] <+mrredwednesday> Rimworld is fun
[3:50:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Rimworld's actually really simple once you get used to it
[3:50:54] <%Archphronimos> You're basically a colony administrator, you tell people what to do, they do it when they get around to it
[3:50:54] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot going on but if chat behaves you can lean on us
[3:50:58] <Duskers> Isn't Rimworld a single player RTS
[3:51:05] <%Valdorick> Pat! Idea - "Let's just try it" week
[3:51:05] <Baeltyr> warhammer will go bad, is my bet
[3:51:09] <TimetodiveLTX> blasian souls
[3:51:10] <Neo_Kaiser> It's just RTS Minecraft
[3:51:11] <+wellshuckit> Easier to dissvalue lives whne they are low poly count.
[3:51:12] <%Jekado> Rimworld can be maximum mind goblins i'm warning you
[3:51:13] <Monkeyweed21> Play more Endless coward
[3:51:13] <%heartlesshealer> <3
[3:51:13] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:51:15] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Rimworld lends itself well to emergent narratives
[3:51:15] <%GarbageNirvana> The game basically plays itself after a while
[3:51:17] <derap41> You're gonna do great play on normal battle difficulty
[3:51:19] <%TalisKanju> When is the warhammer stream?
[3:51:24] <%dekkitout> That'll make for a great bit

[3:58:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The Dark Souls / Skyrim comparrison hits harder when you Consider that FromSoft has Iterated on their game style like 4 times with each one being very different and often technically improved upon the last.... Skyrim hasn't grown a single bit. Instead it just festers and spreads to smartphones and refridgerators....
