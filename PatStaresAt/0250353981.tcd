[0:03:08] <+Sirsquizz> decorate your orbiter!
[0:03:10] <$ThePaleSage> Man I haven’t been able do do this since my pc broke
[0:03:27] <+mad_jacko> Hype for boil popping
[0:03:31] <stigna1> I just spend six hours reading fanmade D&D lore and I'm on a huge fantasy trip. How's everyone doing?
[0:03:32] <+Beau_Oddball > Hello everyone
[0:03:37] <PessimisticOptimism> I couldn’t beat p5
[0:03:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> is plaguestar even worth it?
[0:03:41] <$grimpokemon> Hey, watching while at work. Need something to fill the silence
[0:03:57] <DraxTD> @PessimisticOptimism how come?
[0:03:58] <SunsetJack> Man, first time I did Plague star, I was not aware to get 10 arcane BP for each...
[0:04:05] <MikeyxStyles> hey what's up stream
[0:04:05] <%Phobaws06> the Plague kripath strike is the best
[0:04:07] <PessimisticOptimism> Got to the last boss without any mats
[0:04:09] <+LogothX> What is plague star anyway?
[0:04:09] <%Phobaws06> so it's worth it
[0:04:11] <%Zceryll> you boys ready for the GLISTENING MAGNIFICENCE!
[0:04:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> somebody needs to drag pat on an eidolon hunt
[0:04:18] <SolitudeOtM> Plague Star with Plague, lol
[0:04:21] <+Shadowthedigger> Plague star is great for affinity farming and if you want the mods. Plus zaw parts.
[0:04:24] <cluckme_arse> why don't they add some pasta
[0:04:29] <SunsetJack> Plague better hosts...
[0:04:32] <DraxTD> @PessimisticOptimism ahhh, yeah that might do it, hope you rotated yuor saves
[0:04:37] <cluckme_arse> heard it makes it go down easier
[0:04:39] <stigna1> @legendfather_of_giants Its super-worth for specific people. Its mostly made for established players who can use a custom zaw and kill the hemocyte in seconds.
[0:04:41] <+Slayer875> Anyone been watching P5A?
[0:04:41] <drakthebest> Plaguestar is for forma
[0:04:42] <+LogothX> Does Warframe ever get hard? It feels kind of empty to me to grind when you just steamroll everything anyway
[0:04:44] <stigna1> Its less worth for rando people.
[0:04:45] <drakthebest> It’s FREE FORMA
[0:04:49] <vivianann> the stream is just buffering for me )):
[0:04:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> only 24 minutes til night. hope he does an eidolon
[0:05:01] <PessimisticOptimism> I did but the grind up to it was kinda nuts.
[0:05:02] <SunsetJack> @drakthebest Still costs credits...
[0:05:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> @stigna1 ah, I haven't even made a zaw yet
[0:05:11] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I would grind more Warframe (dang you pat for getting me back on my Warframe bullshit), but seems that the game keeps crashing my drivers.
[0:05:31] <%TheSniperJoe> Woohoo Warframe nonsense!
[0:05:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can get to places that are hard, they just don't give you an awful lot for the hardest shit
[0:05:34] <PessimisticOptimism> That’s my only issue with p5. The safe rooms getting so sparse at times
[0:05:39] <stigna1> @LogothX It gets hard as you set your own goals. I like to top clan leaderboards solo, which requires designing and making custom builds. They're coming out with some "endgame content" and next week.
[0:05:40] <drakthebest> @logothx the entire game is infinite grind. It’s really really important to not actually play it too much once you’re done with the quests or you’ll burn yourself out pretty fast
[0:05:46] <MikeyxStyles> @sunsetjack credits might as be free the way how they just wave em around lol
[0:05:58] <%Remery_> Has anyone eaten Lunch yet?
[0:06:05] <$grimpokemon> Nope
[0:06:05] <+LogothX> I mean like, hard enemies
[0:06:06] <+MajorCrasher> Me
[0:06:07] <cluckme_arse> dat grind tho
[0:06:09] <%SneakyPenguin77> i had Chipotle
[0:06:09] <SolitudeOtM> nope
[0:06:10] <SunsetJack> @MikeyxStyles Yea but saying free forma isn't really free...
[0:06:14] <%InkblotBlues> Early lunch for Konzu!
[0:06:20] <+augurgewalt> aw yeah gonna fish on the plains while watching this
[0:06:22] <PessimisticOptimism> I forced myself to wake up lol
[0:06:22] <cluckme_arse> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[0:06:23] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Yeah I only really jump on Warframe when big new things drop.
[0:06:26] <ZodiakHunter> Konzu eats lunch at 10am
[0:06:30] <+LogothX> Like, Monster Hunter is satisfying because things will eat you if you don;t pay attention. In warframe you just autopilot everything and nothing can touch you.
[0:06:36] <%Slayer875> @PessimisticOptimism I'm in the final palace. I've been going for nearly a half hour and only just encountered a safe room
[0:06:38] <%Remery_> 10am is brunch
[0:06:39] <SunsetJack> Also, with Plague helping Pat, they are going to do the event really well...
[0:06:45] <drakthebest> I mean, if you compare to the years it takes to make normal forma or the ~12 plat cost per forma on the market it’s free
[0:06:50] <%SneakyPenguin77> I think I'll set up the stream on my tablet and play CSGO
[0:06:54] <drakthebest> Also hunters munitions is incredibly op
[0:06:56] <cluckme_arse> Squid1 Squid2 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid2 Squid4
[0:06:56] <SunsetJack> They might need a Nekros if Pat wants the mods.
[0:06:59] <Gregorhasjoined> I've had warframe installed on my pc for the last few weeks and have been way to swamped to play it. This helps since i can watch stream in one monitor and read up on IDS systems in the other! Thanks @AngriestPat !
[0:07:01] <TheDom275> man I need more axi v6 to drop
[0:07:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> @Slayer875 From my experience with low armor frames, if you don't have abilities up, you're gonna get one-shotted
[0:07:06] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @logothx If you want hard you need to complete the story missions(
[0:07:18] <stigna1> Yeah, the hunter mods are actually really good and you can forma a weapon or frame as you farm the event. Its hyper-efficient forma-ing.
[0:07:21] <PessimisticOptimism> @slayer875 that place has the longest puzzle rooms between saves. It was nerve wracking and almost made me stop
[0:07:28] <%Phobaws06> hunter munitions is the best for crit weapons
[0:07:30] <stigna1> I got a quanta vandal from 0-forma to 6 in around 3 hours.
[0:07:34] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @logothx up to War Within and then you unlock the sortie missions
[0:07:40] <+LogothX> How long does that take?
[0:07:41] <redeq2> !raffle Blue Yetti Hot Zone
[0:07:41] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[0:07:53] <ゑりよとのゑ> he did harrow quest yet ?
[0:08:00] <%Phobaws06> not yet
[0:08:07] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @logothx It can take a while

[0:08:15] <PessimisticOptimism> Anyone see the new RLM video?
[0:08:19] <stigna1> Hunter munitions is so good that its worth building stuff for crits, to proc bleed on high level baddies. Bleed goes through armour, which can otherwise be hard to beat.
[0:08:26] <stigna1> Er...what's RLM? :p

[0:11:31] <Maekosyn> Guy's i have a question about Warframe. it's been about 2 years since I've last played. How hard will it be to get back into the game? I'm sure much has changed.
[0:11:31] <%Slayer875> @PessimisticOptimism I mean it had a plot reason in 3 but not 4 and 5
[0:11:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Nice shirt Pat

[0:11:51] <vingadivo> i used to eat soap
[0:11:56] <+Neecoan> eat gum with the whole wrapper
[0:11:58] <PessimisticOptimism> @slayer875 so they just continued the “tradition”
[0:11:58] <SunsetJack> Were they even edible before...?
[0:12:02] <%Dingus_Tickler> Muffin / Cupcakes wrappers I chew, but not eat
[0:12:03] <+babyacid> but did you drink....THE KUVA???
[0:12:06] <stigna1> But...toothpaste is not edible and that's SUPPOSED to go in your moouth.
[0:12:06] <%Dingus_Tickler> They still have flavor in them
[0:12:10] <Lionkevinson> if the cake sticks to the paper or wrapper I would eat it
[0:12:10] <+pr0at> anything is edible at least once
[0:12:11] <Derkinstacker> Edible panties are a staple diet of plague.
[0:12:12] <%ssaryn> Get the flavor off that wrapper dude, if you got Chocolate Muffins and there's still some chocolate on it, just eat it.
[0:12:14] <+Wukku> First time in plague star?

[0:21:59] <TheBaconifier> What mastery rank is pat?
[0:22:04] <SolitudeOtM> Zaws are melee weapons in general Pat
[0:22:06] <stigna1> Only a little bit wrong, which is fair. Good job, gang!
[0:22:07] <SunsetJack> Yea
[0:22:11] <%Dingus_Tickler> "Which I barely understand" sounds like 60% of Warframe
[0:22:13] <Hmkks> When I played Warframe near launch, I had the most fun when I found the fastest attack speed daggers, and just put all my effort to boosting attack speed even further.
[0:22:13] <%ssaryn> Well that last part is right.
[0:22:15] <monkey342twitch> that is dull
[0:22:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you want get big numbers
[0:22:17] <+Reaverund> Yo, is the gameplay in this game fun at all? Because it just looks like a big ol progression addiction
[0:22:20] <StrawberryBandit> celerityTuturu
[0:22:23] <KTDelgado> wrong, Its about the free forma
[0:22:25] <+WizardofWazz> Tenno Skooooouuummmm

[0:22:32] <ZodiakHunter> @Reaverund that's exactly what it is. It's fantastic
[0:22:33] <Gregorhasjoined> you know fuckiiiiiiiin
[0:22:38] <Worldbrand> that movie is simultaneously overrated and underrated
[0:22:42] <@Mechz71> hmm
[0:22:43] <zfenty> or rick and morty
[0:22:44] <Gregorhasjoined> fuckin is the best filler word
[0:22:45] <+iGunnerz> hey pat :)
[0:22:46] <StrawberryBandit> oh come on plague
[0:22:47] <Volkrotia> The gameplay IS very fun, which is why the progression rarely feels like a chore
[0:22:47] <inwind1995> chain of harrow when?
[0:22:48] <%drabberfaun535> Carrier is for utiltiy, helios if for scaning stuff, wyrm is for crowd control, shade is for shitty stealth, dethcube is for damage but it sucks really bad, diriga is a sniper but also sucks, taxon is for keeping things cool, and djinn is for sadistic people who hate sentinels.
[0:22:49] <%Dingus_Tickler> Tom Cruise should be dead now
[0:22:51] <%President_Miyazaki> HAH

[0:22:55] <%ssaryn> Speaking of famous people, Will Ferrell is in the Hospital because of a car crash.
[0:22:57] <The_Blumper> Betty White should be dead by now
[0:22:58] <fairore> @worldbrand what movie
[0:22:58] <Hmkks> Could Atlas was by the matrix director dudes right?
[0:23:04] <StrawberryBandit> did he say ripe
[0:23:04] <Worldbrand> @fairore cloud atlas
[0:23:04] <redeq2> Cloud Atlas literally copies DAVID CAGE
[0:23:05] <rufus2k2> Tom Cruise is nigh-immortal
[0:23:06] <@Mechz71> Does anyone know if watching this stream will get me my twitch drop I missed from the Devstream yesterday?
[0:23:07] <XanthousDiavolo> tom cruise will not die, the scientology keeps him alive
[0:23:08] <stigna1> @Reaverund The game is super varied, with lots of stuff to do. Its fun; you don't have to grind anything. Pat and tryhards in general gravitate towards that though.
[0:23:10] <diiizle> Betty White was old 40 years ago
[0:23:13] <%commanderclaw> Betty White is 96

[0:32:09] <Volkrotia> Fallout 4, AKA linear RPG with no branching dialogue or story paths
[0:32:14] <+AlexEnglishMajor> @sgrim new Vegas is better than both
[0:32:16] <%IMDRanged> Running Fallout 3 on PC takes a lot of BS tweeking

[0:34:08] <%ApexWalrus> @AngriestPat -70 in real temperature or Celsius?
[0:34:22] <redhawk99> @AngriestPat what about vancouver
[0:34:23] <%Rorinator> Halifax is nice
[0:34:24] <Skybrid> @ApexWalrus You got it backwards
[0:34:26] <+Trotski7> replace pat-cam with elmo-cam
[0:34:27] <+Templar15> Pat and Plague combine their winds to destroy Paige confirmed
[0:34:27] <%machshop> it's only good for farmland and spaceports
[0:34:31] <Gregorhasjoined> Still snowing in Cape Breton @AngriestPat , Its a neverending buttfuck of a winter
[0:34:32] <+Reaverund> I live in a city in the southern US who gets regularly fucked by tornadoes.The summer atmosphere is a littler weird here.
[0:34:33] <%Remery_> Is Canada very rainy?
[0:34:36] <%ssaryn> Man Geoff is a cool dude.
[0:34:37] <Ashratcliffe1992> Hey everyone.
[0:34:39] <redhawk99> Its like 14 here in vancouver
[0:34:39] <+otter49> British Columbia seems nice
[0:34:40] <Ashratcliffe1992> How's it going?
[0:34:41] <stigna1> @ApexWalrus -94 in your fake, liar measurements.
[0:34:43] <XanthousDiavolo> very nice podcast with warframe in the corner
[0:34:43] <+KSabot> has pat started playing yet
[0:34:44] <$SGrim> @ApexWalrus -70 Fahrenheit and Celsius are just about the same temperature.
[0:34:44] <diiizle> Vancouver is absurdly expensive tho
[0:34:45] <Volkrotia> 20% of Toronrot is okay, the rest is boring tash
[0:34:45] <+SuppishVillain> Yo, is radiation a good element?
[0:34:48] <weizamaleza> Toronto is not good?
[0:34:48] <Stratiotai2> saskatchewan is pretty cool js
[0:34:52] <buttdirt> @Remery_ when it's not snowing, it's always raining
[0:34:59] <+AntithesisEK> if they deplete that massive ground aquifer in the midwest that dust bowl's gonna come right back @fruit_pie_the_magician
[0:35:01] <stigna1> Toronto is great! Begone, lies!
[0:35:01] <ShazBo2000> Vancouver rains too much
[0:35:03] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Pat you LOOK like an inner city Montrealer
[0:35:04] <+GreenBrains_> we got awesome lakes in manitoba
[0:35:06] <%Remery_> @buttdirt that's unfortunate
[0:35:18] <%ApexWalrus> @SGrim Really? I knew they met up at around -33 but I didn't know they stayed so close
[0:35:23] <Skybrid> @Volkrotia Which part is the gender studies one? So I could avoid it while visiting
[0:35:23] <$Slimshazbot> @angriestpat Why don't you have Inaros yet you scub loving FUCK
[0:35:26] <+WizardofWazz> sounds nice
[0:35:29] <drakthebest> I bet siberia is worse
[0:35:30] <+Loyks> I'm loving this podcast
[0:35:31] <Gregorhasjoined> Prairies are basically the wheat/corn desert fields
[0:35:39] <Worldbrand> are Manitobans even real? we just don't know
[0:35:40] <SunsetJack> I thought that was normal...
[0:35:41] <Stratiotai2> saskatchewan is great sonmuch space
[0:36:04] <Volkrotia> @Skybrid Anywhere close to Uinversity of Toronto St/George and most of downtown really
[0:36:07] <+SnideTheCrow> The addiction
[0:36:07] <YautjaBorne> I got into Warframe cause of Pat but fuck off with them orikin challenge puzzles just to access the war within
[0:36:10] <%ssaryn> He's got a point. Anything less than 3 Star weakness, might as well not be used.
[0:36:15] <Skybrid> @Volkrotia Thank you!
[0:36:23] <$SGrim> @ApexWalrus there's a difference of about 10 to 20 degrees for most everything involving negative temps below -33. In other words, not much.
[0:36:31] <stigna1> @YautjaBorne You can cheat them super hard with various frames, if you're having trouble.
[0:36:32] <%25RPM> i was skiped rip
[0:36:34] <+AntithesisEK> c h a r m i n g you say
[0:36:38] <DantesAnimus> Is Plague the Bayonetta looking character??
[0:36:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> yeah, high level in this game basically is a chess game to find the most fun shit to do that is still effective from myriad options
[0:36:40] <+vegiemite_> And some monsters are completely resistant against thunder.
[0:36:45] <Skybrid> "Burst of Charm"
[0:36:45] <YautjaBorne> I use frost
[0:36:46] <+MajorCrasher> Plague is pretty creepy, but i like that
[0:36:46] <$SGrim> @ApexWalrus And that's at maximum, not for every measurement.
[0:36:51] <SunsetJack> I enjoyed when you stream plague.
[0:36:55] <stigna1> @YautjaBorne Also, SPOILERMODE is useful for holding down two buttons at the same time, ect.
[0:36:57] <Volkrotia> @Skybrid Anywhere east of the main center of Downtown is kinda shit, other than great live shows and a good nightlife, we dont have much. The Further east you go from the city, to better it gets
[0:36:58] <Derkinstacker> Streamy bursts of retrograde ejaculation.
[0:37:07] <ToneBacas> alright! Pat is playing free money simulator
[0:37:16] <%drabberfaun535> why is plague only mr 18?
[0:37:17] <%Dingus_Tickler> Hey guys, remember when Pat was talking about trying out a 24 Hour Stream of FFXIV, but then bailed out super hard? I 'member
[0:37:23] <DraxTD> welp "streamy bursts" is now a cannon term with @AngriestPat ... work on that fan art comic
[0:37:23] <Goergorion> He has to build his meter to use his Stream Burst
[0:37:23] <viewtifulr> Me and my pals constantly refer to calling each other a woolie or a pat on either: Just not looking past fashion and for being of course the obvious, wrong
[0:37:25] <+pr0at> it took me a good month to fix my sleep schedule but it was worth it
[0:37:28] <stigna1> Pat is very right!
[0:37:34] <stigna1> Huzzah!
[0:37:35] <stigna1> Oh no.
[0:37:36] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler To be fair, FFXIV was getting super fucked.
[0:37:50] <drakthebest> Titania is better
[0:37:50] <$SGrim> @Dingus_Tickler I remember how hyped he was for it. That's what told me he'd never do it. LUL
[0:37:50] <%President_Miyazaki> Pat but most monsters aren't resistant to Thunder. Pink Rathian isn't even 3 star weakness to it.
[0:38:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn In his defense, MMOs can get real repetitive and boring after 1 or 2 hours
[0:38:08] <%maskedriderhero> Pat of Gripes is my favorite ship
[0:38:13] <@Mechz71> @Dingus_Tickler Yeah that time when the servers we dying and NO ONE as able to play FF14?
[0:38:13] <%Aldurin_> Plague is only MR 18? why is this casual giving Pat advice?
[0:38:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> @SGrim LUL
[0:38:24] <zakti_prime> don't go in the water at night >(
[0:38:29] <Skybrid> Zephyr looks like a plane in the Plains when she is flying over your head, it's pretty epic
[0:38:36] <+Nephthyz> The water is not as bad at night now.
[0:38:37] <%MultipleJiggs> Man getting back into Warframe always seems so daunting. They change and add so much stuff.
[0:38:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Archwing Pat
[0:38:38] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler I mean... yeah... but Stormblood was actually tenable for the first 10-20 hours because story.
[0:38:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> @Mechz71 Hey now, we don't record history correctly because we choose not to
[0:38:41] <+hanzofiyuri> Use that Mag/Nova combo.
[0:38:43] <KTDelgado> use titania for dat dps
[0:38:44] <%Slayer875> Anyone seen the ending of Dragon ball Super?
[0:38:45] <stigna1> @zakti_prime Don't worry; Rhino's iron skin protects from all sorts of fun and interactive.
[0:38:51] <+Nephthyz> The halving of shields used to be stick until you left the plains, but it's fixed now.
[0:38:56] <%InkblotBlues> It's a bouncing baby boy!
[0:38:59] <Ashratcliffe1992> This game has open style areas now?
[0:39:02] <+Shadowthedigger> Get some Oberon in there for all the armor.
[0:39:11] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn Ah, whenever MMO is a topic, I automatically think of WoW
[0:39:12] <Worldbrand> he's got a cute little button nose
[0:39:12] <%ssaryn> His boss fight is awful.
[0:39:15] <Skybrid> Plague Star needs more diversity or shorter duration, saying that as someone who played the game since CBT/Alpha (if it means anything)
[0:39:17] <+AntithesisEK> 🤔 phylaxis plural would be phylaxi?
[0:39:21] <stigna1> The law of retribution was a sweet raid though.
[0:39:23] <Klefth> FUCK VAY HEK
[0:39:24] <hntronium> SKOOM
[0:39:25] <lab990> LOOK BROTHERS, TITS!
[0:39:26] <$SGrim> TENNO MAGGOTS SwiftRage
[0:39:26] <%maskedriderhero> THESE FOOLS ARE STILL BREATHING MY AIR, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
[0:39:44] <Skybrid> @AntithesisEK Phylaxissies
[0:39:50] <Ashratcliffe1992> Is this one of those actual free games where you can get everything by just playing it?
[0:39:53] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler That's honestly fine, unless people can get into FFXIV, an MMO is an MMO, it won't matter what difference there is to them.
[0:39:55] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Vay Hek? More like WAY BEST
[0:39:58] <Skybrid> They come here...
[0:40:00] <+AntithesisEK> There's something... Lewd about that, @Skybrid
[0:40:11] <+bbHighvalor> @ashratcliffe1992 no
[0:40:11] <+Nephthyz> @Ashratcliffe1992 Yup, besides Prime Access cosmetics and tennogen.
[0:40:12] <drakthebest> You actually totally do though, Rhino is the most broken frame in the game
[0:40:15] <%ssaryn> MAN EQUINOX IS SO FUCKING GOOD
[0:40:18] <@Mechz71> I don't fucking have equinox
[0:40:26] <+Nephthyz> I have Equinox, she's really fun.
[0:40:28] <$Yakobro> crazy talk
[0:40:28] <stigna1> Man, equinox is sweet.
[0:40:29] <+Nephthyz> Day Equinox a best.
[0:40:31] <%Dingus_Tickler> Is Nova Prime still have that OP ability that crowd controls the whole map super effectively?
[0:40:33] <+gozzojt27> equinox is my boy
[0:40:36] <@Mechz71> I don't have that frame at all
[0:40:38] <+AntithesisEK> LUL Anti-Life Thanato-Bubble
[0:40:42] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[0:40:46] <%XzileGaming> Pat the Liar
[0:40:46] <+Shadowthedigger> Equinox is cancer to farm.
[0:40:48] <stigna1> Yo, night equinox is great! Sleep into covert lethality has great scaling!
[0:40:51] <+Nephthyz> Psst, Equinox is a girl.
[0:40:59] <urs0jb> well, i farmed equinox 3 times xD
[0:40:59] <DantesAnimus> CRAZY TALK less than 10 minutes in to gameplay.
[0:41:02] <%ssaryn> Equinox only needs like 1 forma for almost any build too.
[0:41:02] <%Dingus_Tickler> Isn't Equinox both genders?
[0:41:03] <DantesAnimus> GG
[0:41:04] <misterlobsterman> Equinox is the best
[0:41:09] <YautjaBorne> fuck that all about FF12 JUDGE Frost lol
[0:41:12] <%Slayer875> Eyyyyyy it's @Stay_Hydrated_Bot
[0:41:13] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PLAT
[0:41:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> Day Equinox is male and Night Equinox is female?
[0:41:15] <+LogothX> Amazing.
[0:41:16] <SunsetJack> Limbo and Chroma might get primes this year...
[0:41:18] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler Mhmm
[0:41:18] <stigna1> No, equinox is 100% gril. She's just grills of various colours.
[0:41:19] <drakthebest> You have seven billion plat who cares just buy more potatoes
[0:41:20] <+LogothX> I have absolutely no idea whats going on
[0:41:20] <stigna1> Yes!
[0:41:24] <UvBenServed> I think Limbo prime is actually next
[0:41:25] <+Nephthyz> @Dingus_Tickler Nope, artist said they're both female.
[0:41:25] <urs0jb> both equinox forms are female
[0:41:26] <+AntithesisEK> both equinox forms are female @Dingus_Tickler
[0:41:28] <Worldbrand> they go male male female female in release order, except for during christmas
[0:41:30] <%ssaryn> Wait what?
[0:41:31] <%Dingus_Tickler> Ah
[0:41:37] <$PimpDaddyPrime> I've set myself the challenge of only using girlframes
[0:41:37] <RahuStalker> Nova and Valkyr say Hi
[0:41:39] <%Dingus_Tickler> I always assumed Equinox was 2 different genders
[0:41:43] <%ssaryn> I actually didn't know that.
[0:41:44] <Skybrid> Limbo/Chroma next, probably
[0:41:45] <lab990> they sometimes go out of order though
[0:41:45] <+gozzojt27> im already hyped for harrow prime
[0:41:48] <stigna1> Terry the Terralyst.
[0:41:49] <+Nephthyz> So the next 3 primes should be Limbo, Chroma and then Mesa.
[0:41:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> EIDOLON
[0:41:52] <+zork990> they dont go in the exact order of release, but they generally follow it
[0:41:53] <SunsetJack> Oh
[0:41:55] <Worldbrand> they ONLY go out of order for the holiday season
[0:41:59] <heytakeiteasyterry> hi plague
[0:42:00] <stigna1> Garry the gauntulyst, harry the hydrolyst.
[0:42:02] <Skybrid> @Dingus_Tickler Nah, day form is just more masculine, but still intended to be female
[0:42:05] <$Yakobro> METAL GEAR?
[0:42:07] <+AntithesisEK> I think the original INTENT was to have it male or female but they just said it's utterly feminine
[0:42:10] <zakti_prime> Terry Garry and harry
[0:42:11] <SolitudeOtM> Terry, Harry, and Garry
[0:42:13] <%InkblotBlues> Has Pat done an Eidolon fight yet?
[0:42:16] <SolitudeOtM> lol
[0:42:16] <Skybrid> Not that gender of warframes means anything outside of aesthetics
[0:42:18] <+Nephthyz> @Worldbrand Guarantee they won't go out of order this year, Mesa will sell incredibly well.
[0:42:29] <jisang0415> pat-"IM HELPING"
[0:42:32] <Worldbrand> Yeah you're probably right about that
[0:42:33] <%Dingus_Tickler> @Skybrid It's mean ass or pecks is what it means
[0:42:33] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat They do it in order of release rotating between 2 male frames and 2 female frames. The next four should be Limbo, Chroma, Mesa, and Equinox.
[0:42:33] <+LogothX> Just dump it in like a can of paint.
[0:42:37] <stigna1> Fun fact! The hemocysts and terralysts can aggro onto one another, and have a kaiju fight.
[0:42:38] <%Dingus_Tickler> Gender does matter 4Head
[0:42:39] <YautjaBorne> Im still trying to get my first prime :(
[0:42:48] <%maskedriderhero> So...is Warframe just a Mirrors Edge MMO, because I rarely see any fighting, just Pat rushing past everything possible
[0:42:51] <drakthebest> They are worth it with very specific weapons and compositions
[0:42:54] <+AntithesisEK> yeah warframe appearance is very "who was the orokin pervert who made this" cause they have no dimorphic value.
[0:42:56] <KTDelgado> but the standing tho
[0:42:56] <SunsetJack> Does Pat want any of the hunter mods...?
[0:42:57] <Skybrid> Turbulence Zephyr + Tonkor in the Plains is so much fun, you can act as artillery, bombing enemies from afar or from the sky
[0:42:57] <TheSpartanThief> Terry, Garry & Harry: the Three Eidolysts
[0:43:27] <fairore> @yautjaborne me to buddy :(
[0:43:28] <+AntithesisEK> sobek is a good boy
[0:43:34] <+AntithesisEK> LUL acid shills
[0:43:35] <SunsetJack> Thank god they buff its reload...
[0:43:35] <Worldbrand> Acid Shells makes the sobek viable!
[0:43:45] <stigna1> We are all acid shills on this blessed day.
[0:43:51] <+babyacid> SO FUCKING GOOD
[0:44:03] <+babyacid> acid shell sobek is bae
[0:44:03] <Skybrid> Sobek reminds me some weapon from Quake 2, unless I confuse it with some other weapon from some other game
[0:44:08] <%ssaryn> Yeyeyeye Inaros
[0:44:09] <%XzileGaming> i cant even see whats going on
[0:44:16] <+Nephthyz> Man, Plague and Pat sure love Rhino.
[0:44:17] <%XzileGaming> gonna go play Hunt Showdown
[0:44:21] <bbjohnny1> Did you do the Harrow quest? Cmon pls i want to see the reaction
[0:44:22] <$Slimshazbot> GET INAROS YOU FUCKSTINK
[0:44:29] <StallordD> Sorties aren't that bad, they're a lot more intimidating than they're actually tough
[0:44:31] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Don't worry, they're ez pez, and your friends can carry fairly easy.
[0:44:32] <Klefth> Man, I want Inaros so bad. I HAVE to get it to look like Anubis. I HAVE TO.
[0:44:34] <drakthebest> You can actually totally do sorties just fine
[0:44:35] <+AntithesisEK> @AngriestPat did anyone ever tell you to SCAN shit or work on Simaris rep for the future?
[0:44:35] <vaan_ratsbane> The number is SO HIGH
[0:44:36] <+Nephthyz> I still need to build Inaros properly.
[0:44:40] <drakthebest> Just need maybe a weapon with a forma or two
[0:44:42] <Skybrid> Just go public and sorties won't be a problem
[0:44:42] <lab990> just cheese them
[0:44:51] <Worldbrand> Also bear in mind you dont actually have to do a lot of fighting in like half the gametypes
[0:45:03] <stigna1> @AntithesisEK He's using Helios on-and-off, so that's cool.
[0:45:07] <$PimpDaddyPrime> so rhino is anti pat
[0:45:08] <+Ciphris> rhino is a big boy
[0:45:09] <%Dingus_Tickler> Forgive my backseat gaming, does Pat have Flow on his Rhino? And if so, why? I never recalled Flow being effective for Rhino
[0:45:11] <+lassieme> Fuck, now I wanna see some fanart of baby rhino
[0:45:13] <$BenLubar> elmo is the baby
[0:45:15] <zakti_prime> pub sorties and hope big boy squad can carry you
[0:45:18] <Ell1ot> hello!
[0:45:24] <Tucker0603> steel Meridian best
[0:45:25] <+MajorCrasher> Rap Factory?
[0:45:30] <StallordD> The only thing tough about Sorties are Pub Spy missions
[0:45:31] <spoofy16> melee attacks in this game just looks really weightless.
[0:45:40] <Skybrid> @Klefth He is probably he most broken 'frame in terms of survivability. You can quite literally make him unkillable, even make it so that he doesn't require energy for that
[0:45:41] <+AntithesisEK> On and off? How curious. @stigna1 simaris rep gets you those infinite scans which is the main thing.
[0:45:43] <Kaffeebohnson> whats the steel meridian logo thats constantly popping up?
[0:45:50] <+AntithesisEK> tfw

[0:46:30] <stigna1> @AntithesisEK Well, carrier is pretty good. But yeah, good point. Course scanners are pretty cheap. I feel like its easier to let him spend creds rather than pester him about min-maxing.
[0:46:30] <NopeBadguy> E X T R A C L E A N
[0:46:32] <+MajorCrasher> Pat...
[0:46:33] <GodlyLuigi> i want to see that lint filter

[0:47:12] <jisang0415> the matt bloodborne situation
[0:47:15] <Kaffeebohnson> @StallordD so is that a mod?
[0:47:16] <+AntithesisEK> Oh yeah he isn't even remotely in a position to half the extraorbital stuff. @stigna1 But I figured his OCD might like never worrying about it again, haha
[0:47:19] <Derkinstacker> Don't worry about it plague.
[0:47:19] <TehMud> Gotta set an alarm for that shit
[0:47:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> max level sortie defense or survival can be really hard with certain conditions
[0:47:22] <+AntithesisEK> to do**
[0:47:25] <$BenLubar> pat wants to get his nails done sometimes too
[0:47:27] <+afterbvrner> any glyph from this??
[0:47:30] <$PimpDaddyPrime> wait why can't you just put it in the dryer after 12 hours, @angriestpat ?
[0:47:30] <StallordD> It's both mods, AND syndicate weapons
[0:47:34] <$BenLubar> I love my UPS
[0:47:39] <Skybrid> @StallordD The lore boss himself! Much love, man
[0:47:40] <@BigNaturalMan59> pat dry ur clothes jeez
[0:47:47] <%XzileGaming> its PRETTY OK
[0:47:48] <StallordD> Sup Skybrid <3
[0:47:50] <+Razputin217> the Hek has an augment that causes a syndicate proc explosion, the Vaykor Hek has it built in automatically
[0:47:51] <$BenLubar> the power has gone out like 8 times in the last two days and I just kept doing stuff on my computer
[0:47:52] <+Nephthyz> Pat's shirt is wet right now.
[0:47:54] <%Dingus_Tickler> Moist, damp Pat
[0:47:56] <%President_Miyazaki> My washer doesn't make noises after its done.
[0:48:02] <%Remery_> That's depressing
[0:48:05] <SunsetJack> If you guys want a nice glyth from reddit, type in "r/warframe" in market.
[0:48:06] <%ssaryn> You're old now... So am I.... Damn it.
[0:48:06] <lord_zaphyr> Pretty okay is not good enough tho @XzileGaming
[0:48:08] <YautjaBorne> propa moist
[0:48:09] <%Dingus_Tickler> Moist, damp Pat with the pair of pants he wore for 2 weeks straight
[0:48:09] <@Mechz71> high end washer dryer to ignore drying your clothes at a higher cost
[0:48:10] <stigna1> There's a "syndicate proc" trait that syndicate weapons come with, and syndicate mods apply. They then charge up until they explode on nearby enemies and buff you.
[0:48:15] <Hmkks> I got really excited abiout a frying pan.
[0:48:16] <+AntithesisEK> I get excited about finding raisin bran in the kitchen.
[0:48:20] <$BenLubar> hey pat you should hire Washua
[0:48:20] <@thenefftw> Don't let it set in
[0:48:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> Being an adult means you appreciate it so much more when people gift you clothing
[0:48:26] <+ElarusTheMage> I dont want to adult any more. FeelsBadMan
[0:48:26] <+Nephthyz> @SunsetJack Who needs a glyph that isn't the Ivara butt glyph?
[0:48:28] <$BenLubar> or is it Woshua?
[0:48:32] <%Dingus_Tickler> Clothing is the best christmas gift
[0:48:32] <%ssaryn> I'M LETTING IT SET IN REAL BAD
[0:48:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Well, not all the stuff
[0:48:38] <zakti_prime> don't touch. the boil!
[0:48:38] <%ApexWalrus> Why doesn't a washer/dryer exist as a single machine?
[0:48:40] <Skybrid> Glistening magnificence!
[0:48:49] <spoofy16> @legendfather_of_giants fast atttacks can still feel weighty like dual blades in monhun. this just looks like he is swinging through air even if he is hitting enemies. it lacks a sense of impact i guess.
[0:48:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> do they have mildew in canada?
[0:49:06] <$BenLubar> @BigNaturalMan59 no they have to import it
[0:49:10] <+AntithesisEK> LUL
[0:49:11] <$PimpDaddyPrime> pull is better crowd control
[0:49:20] <+AntithesisEK> p. good Ben
[0:49:26] <%ssaryn> Spaghetti Nidus, just saying.
[0:49:26] <$PimpDaddyPrime> mag > rhino
[0:49:32] <+WizardofWazz> it gets boring quick
[0:49:37] <Skybrid> Plague has delicious voice, no gay.
[0:49:37] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm using Kulstar
[0:49:49] <$BenLubar> why is Google giving me notifications about the weather in a neighboring town
[0:49:50] <+M4T1A5> mesa best frame
[0:49:51] <SolitudeOtM> Chroma is the furry Warframe
[0:50:01] <Klefth> Excal tho
[0:50:01] <@BigNaturalMan59> equinox4lyfe
[0:50:03] <%Dingus_Tickler> Chroma is really good for farming last time I remember
[0:50:04] <+pr0at> is gara any good?
[0:50:04] <+AntithesisEK> that's a strange take
[0:50:04] <MartwyPies> Pat is not even a real human being LMAO
[0:50:11] <+AntithesisEK> especially when oberon exists
[0:50:12] <+Shadowthedigger> What? what? WAHT?
[0:50:16] <zakti_prime> no hemocyte?
[0:50:17] <Ser_Randal> degenerate
[0:50:19] <+Ciphris> no one likes dragon boy skin
[0:50:25] <+MajorCrasher> Bad Dragon
[0:50:27] <%HRDSalami654> Dragon dick.
[0:50:28] <+Nephthyz> No, that guy is WRONG. Valkyr is the furry of Warframe.
[0:50:29] <+Shadowthedigger> Best Dragon
[0:50:31] <vaan_ratsbane> cream gravy
[0:50:33] <Oak_bogle> well that was a clean cut. ty Pat
[0:50:33] <+Razputin217> I don't know how to mod Chroma properly
[0:50:35] <Worldbrand> Wh... no, no one uses effigy for damage
[0:50:35] <+AntithesisEK> that is NOT Chroma's purpose at all
[0:50:37] <greatersea> chroma isn't a dragon, he's *wearing* a dragon
[0:50:38] <+MajorCrasher> his turret is useless, no one uses it
[0:50:38] <stigna1> Chroma is sorta without a nichie right now. He's a shaman with a dragon-skin-cloak that he can animate to serve as a turret
[0:50:39] <%HRDSalami654> He's more useful for his buffs though.
[0:50:41] <Ell1ot> i want to play the warframe. which starter should i pick?
[0:50:41] <%Dingus_Tickler> Isn't that Chroma's pelt or some shit?
[0:50:43] <Croetec> that is some crazy talk
[0:50:47] <%Dingus_Tickler> It's just a pelt
[0:50:49] <Skybrid> He is a knight wearing dragon pelt, but it's not really a dragon
[0:50:50] <+lassieme> yeah, his 2 dragon abilties are bad
[0:50:50] <+Nephthyz> That guy is wrong, Valkyr is the furry of Warframe.
[0:50:50] <zakti_prime> Vauban is engie
[0:50:52] <%XzileGaming> i came to see Skelmo
[0:50:55] <+MajorCrasher> Chroma is huge armor and damage boy
[0:50:57] <%TheMattman1313> Wait did Pat buy Rhino Prime? Wiki says it's valuted
[0:50:58] <Skybrid> It's supposedly a Sentient
[0:51:00] <+AntithesisEK> Chroma is a dragon knight / dragon slayer. Except the dragon is the Sentient he's wearing.
[0:51:00] <%InkblotBlues> No Pat. It is Elmo's stream, you are just the guest.
[0:51:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it totally isn't useful
[0:51:04] <Derrigan> @AngriestPat Remember Pat if you don't like the skins in the game the Steam Workshop has a bunch of fan made skins that are pretty much all incredible.
[0:51:07] <@thenefftw> Same
[0:51:11] <+Nephthyz> Valkyr is basically just a catgirl frame.
[0:51:23] <+lassieme> @TheMattman1313 it was recently unvaulted
[0:51:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> Valkyr is Wolverine, not Catwoman
[0:51:23] <stigna1> @Ell1ot Excal is always good. He's got longevity and flexibility. Mag is sorta eh but if you really want spells she's cool. Volt is groovy if you like speed.
[0:51:25] <miracleman6> what are you talking about Pat Stares at Mercenary Kings was a masterpiece
[0:51:28] <+GreenBrains_> sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag sandbag him Plague
[0:51:29] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Aaaaaaah I love you for you Pat, I CARE
[0:51:30] <Skybrid> Valkyr is more like Cheetah than Catwoman
[0:51:30] <+Ciphris> frog lady best lady
[0:51:32] <MartwyPies> It's because it contrasts your insanity with Semi-Normal People to increase your weirdness
[0:51:33] <Worldbrand> Yeah but Pat, a stream is more than the sum of its parts. You multiply the experience.
[0:51:36] <stigna1> Pat is growing STRONG!
[0:51:36] <vaan_ratsbane> Kappa //
[0:51:38] <SolitudeOtM> How is Vallkyr the furry warframe? Chroma looks like a furry/scalie.
[0:51:42] <%XzileGaming> EXCUSES PLAGUE
[0:51:43] <tierney12> pat > plague confirmed PogChamp
[0:51:44] <Goergorion> @AngriestPat You have been brainwash to think you need the power of friendship to grow strong.
[0:51:45] <Lysdexic9541> Fuck yeah MAJORITY
[0:51:46] <+Razputin217> Valkyr is basically Lady Deathstrike
[0:51:48] <Ell1ot> neat
[0:51:50] <%TheMattman1313> @lassieme Oh neato, which relics?
[0:51:53] <@Mechz71> what is this screen
[0:51:55] <+Nephthyz> @SolitudeOtM She has a cat helmet, her Prime and deluxe skins have cat tails and claws.
[0:51:56] <lab990> is oberon a furry?
[0:51:57] <DantesAnimus> You're doing great sweetie!!
[0:51:58] <zakti_prime> @ell1ot Excal is well rounded
[0:52:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> Warframe Whale
[0:52:10] <%Dingus_Tickler> What Pat aspires to be
[0:52:13] <stigna1> @lab990 Nah, he's a druid-paladin.
[0:52:16] <SolitudeOtM> Oh my god Oberon is a furry warframe too
[0:52:20] <Morsuzado> Pat, you work well with a foil.
[0:52:20] <+AntithesisEK> whale warframe 🤔
[0:52:21] <Derkinstacker> Only 9? Christ pat.
[0:52:28] <Skybrid> @lab990 He is a Tolkienist Elf cosplayer
[0:52:31] <tierney12> is that a loli? WutFace
[0:52:37] <%Dingus_Tickler> One of the alligators broke Eli's internet cord again
[0:52:38] <+MajorCrasher> yes
[0:52:39] <ArcticAsylum> This game is basically Mini Transformers if you think about it
[0:52:41] <%Dingus_Tickler> Time to get the stick
[0:52:41] <Derkinstacker> With all those frames you should be like over 10 by now.
[0:52:42] <stigna1> @AngriestPat There's a discord hotkey to mute it set to space.
[0:52:48] <Klefth> I got a Nikana prime blueprint today and was so goddamn disappointed to find it was vaulted :(
[0:52:48] <miracleman6> could be a push to mute maybe?
[0:52:51] <+lassieme> @TheMattman1313 Its back to being vaulted now, but its on the wiki
[0:52:55] <MartwyPies> Pat it's been seven years please wake up me and Dad miss you so much, come back to us
[0:52:57] <@Mechz71> The Kripath part
[0:52:58] <+WizardofWazz> ***
[0:53:04] <SunsetJack> Get each exodia's 10 times Pat.
[0:53:05] <Worldbrand> Get all zaw parts and 10 of both arcanes
[0:53:07] <%maskedriderhero> My dad brought burger king home for dinner all because of that sourdough burger. He hates fastfood. I dunno how to feel
[0:53:09] <+babyacid> ZAW HEADS AND WEAPONS = MASTERY
[0:53:11] <%commanderclaw> Cursed PCC
[0:53:16] <%Aldurin_> @AngriestPat it'll take each exodia 10x of to get a single max rank version of it
[0:53:20] <%maskedriderhero> I would have preferred some chicken strips or something else...
[0:53:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> all you should get is kripath pieces, then heart nyth and the green rock
[0:53:25] <Bailey__gaming> infant unlock war within due to getting no challenge room spawning
[0:53:27] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Tell him to google "warframe spacebar mutes discord"
[0:53:27] <tierney12> @babyacid STRIKES is the word you're looking for OpieOP
[0:53:29] <+zork990> snipetron and ether daggers
[0:53:35] <+MajorCrasher> use a controller Plague Kappa
[0:53:36] <%D_day> Want are the next Primes to come back out of the vault?
[0:53:37] <Zbljuv> you dont need max rank exodia
[0:53:37] <Skybrid> @maskedriderhero Feel satiated, probably
[0:53:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> also amp parts
[0:53:42] <Zbljuv> its not worth it
[0:53:46] <@BigNaturalMan59> get the dalamud parts
[0:53:53] <@Mechz71> Get them just to have them I guess
[0:53:55] <Zbljuv> rank 1 is enough
[0:53:57] <DantesAnimus> Eat that brain to get Frames on the inside
[0:53:59] <+Ciphris> @AngriestPat plague stars the only place to get snipetron and the mods gettem
[0:54:05] <+Razputin217> thats where regular Snipetron is?
[0:54:05] <SunsetJack> Are you aiming to get the mods from the boss Pat? It's the hunter set mods but they do come back from Ghoul Bounties.
[0:54:09] <Worldbrand> You get ether daggers from an earlier quest, but snipetron is unavailable outside of plague star yeah?
[0:54:09] <+pr0at> the numbers spell disaster for you at sacrifice
[0:54:11] <+babyacid> @tierney12 Yah. But not sure Pat knows.
[0:54:14] <ArcticAsylum> You nees the five pieces of Exodia
[0:54:20] <Skybrid> @Worldbrand Yep
[0:54:26] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat any tips for getting the challenge room mods u need to unlock war within?
[0:54:27] <stigna1> Well, I tried to help Plague.
[0:54:32] <tierney12> EXODIA OBLITERATE SwiftRage
[0:54:32] <Skybrid> @ArcticAsylum 10, actually
[0:54:33] <%ApexWalrus> Some say kosm
[0:54:35] <Prism_Wing> Some say Causm
[0:54:37] <%Aldurin_> doggo on screen!
[0:54:40] <drakthebest> Get the CC arcane, the damage one is garbage. The real big thing you get is the free forma
[0:54:42] <+AntithesisEK> how embarrassing
[0:54:43] <%Aldurin_> look at the cute doggos!
[0:54:45] <zakti_prime> puppers
[0:54:45] <drakthebest> Free forma is so fucking good
[0:54:47] <@BigNaturalMan59> thebetCas
[0:54:47] <ArcticAsylum> @skybrid Ten??? Since when?
[0:55:02] <Skybrid> @ArcticAsylum Unless I'm wrong, it always was. Like with any Arcane
[0:55:04] <ArcticAsylum> I'm 21 and i feel old now
[0:55:15] <ArcticAsylum> I swear it's five
[0:55:19] <Ponch65> @AngriestPat What bluetooth adapter do you use for your ps4 controller on pc?
[0:55:21] <MartwyPies> Please take at least a 1 year long break from RPG LP's. I love you but I cant take this
[0:55:27] <Zbljuv> whens Witcher 3 lp?
[0:55:29] <Volkrotia> TSLRCM on steam is the best way to play KOTOR 2
[0:55:33] <+AntithesisEK> yeah there's 10 parts to an arcane for max rank
[0:55:40] <zakti_prime> 10 arcanes for full rank yes
[0:55:51] <+Reaverund> But Exodia is 5 pieces
[0:55:51] <%DoctorPavel4U> Will you charge up her loading ramp pat?
[0:55:55] <stigna1> Full Desert Bus playthrough when?
[0:55:57] <zakti_prime> But are the build costs worth it
[0:56:01] <ArcticAsylum> IM TALKING ABOUT YU GI OH NERDS
[0:56:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> When's the Baldur's Gate LP
[0:56:06] <Derkinstacker> Like 90% of the stuff Woolie wants from KOTOR exists in KOTOR 2.
[0:56:14] <+Reaverund> Because you can only have 5 cards in your hand
[0:56:24] <Daxalog> USE YOUR STIMS!
[0:56:25] <+CuddlyKaiju> aww man kotor2 would be the best lp
[0:56:28] <SolitudeOtM> There's a resolution fix mod that increases the size of text in kotor 2 isn't there?
[0:56:29] <ArcticAsylum> Well Woolie shouldn't be bad
[0:56:39] <Ell1ot> those numbers need to be so big!
[0:56:44] <%Dingus_Tickler> Yeah, it sucks that you have to play so differently for LPs. It's nothing like playing a game personally and privately by yourself
[0:56:45] <darklegion333> dont give the people the lp they all want
[0:56:55] <+Valison> Woolie is just the worst RPG player in general
[0:57:02] <ArcticAsylum> Because Woolie is bad, thats the answer
[0:57:08] <stigna1> Hey hey, its not about Min-maxing. Its about having fun!
[0:57:12] <Ahk_90> !uptime
[0:57:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 57m 21s.
[0:57:22] <Zbljuv> WHENS WITCHER 3 LP
[0:57:33] <%Dingus_Tickler> I know a perfect RPG game for Woolie 4Head DRAGON AGE 2! It's the action game he's always wanted! Kappa
[0:57:44] <diiizle> Woolie never bothers to learn the systems of a game, but then expects the game to work how he wants it to. Really bad for rpg LPs LUL
[0:57:47] <feuddude> cheaters win super hard
[0:57:47] <$BenLubar> lie steat cheal
[0:57:52] <%Dingus_Tickler> It's more Action-y than Monster Hunter World Kappa
[0:58:06] <Ell1ot> how come people were mad at Woolie when he picked Mag?
[0:58:15] <SunsetJack> Start the mission...
[0:58:16] <Twoiis> leeeech
[0:58:16] <Prism_Wing> @benlubar thank u
[0:58:19] <Morsuzado> so when are we going to have an lp with someone that can read at the controls again?
[0:58:20] <+Phantom_Jack> zaw farming? hoo boy, i sure hope you love the plains more than i do
[0:58:22] <Daxalog> If I put all my points into strong and fast why cant I pass these Inteligence challenges with my STRONG!!??
[0:58:25] <zakti_prime> no hemocyte hijinks for stream ? :0
[0:58:25] <+SilverDevilfish> Cheating making a BioWare RPG more bearable why I never... Mass Effect 2
[0:58:31] <ArcticAsylum> Just play as a Scout/Consular and you can do everything yourself
[0:58:33] <drakthebest> Not only could he do it but it would be faster
[0:58:35] <feuddude> @ell1ot she was real bad before since recent buffs
[0:58:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> It's totally not a begineer frame Excal would help @AngriestPat
[0:58:42] <HypeArbalest> Hi pat
[0:58:43] <stigna1> @Ell1ot Mag is sorta bad, but more than that she's anti-woolie's playstyle. People were concerned that the choice would diminish his enjoyment of the game we all love.
[0:58:51] <Primary_> mag has super boring design
[0:58:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Mag is great, but not for new players
[0:58:52] <drakthebest> Also excalibur is a fucking bitch to farm
[0:58:54] <spry_watchdog> only shy
[0:58:55] <SunsetJack> Mag is decent but like, requires a lot of work...
[0:58:56] <junipxr> quiette shy LUL
[0:58:58] <+zork990> mag recently got buffed though
[0:58:58] <alextrebeken> but mag has a cool helmet thing
[0:59:02] <arcadeHemorrhage > Mags fine
[0:59:06] <darklegion333> and excalibur is the harder of the first three to get
[0:59:07] <+Dasbubba> @ell1ot I think it was less mad and more that it’s funny that he wanted a big punch character and picked the furthest thing from a big punch character. I find her fun and her gimmicks are cool even if she’s not meta.
[0:59:09] <+Reaverund> I think that's more of a problem with the games design and less of a problem with Woolie picking the things he likes
[0:59:10] <+babyacid> but she's been reworked since.
[0:59:10] <Twoiis> That mag deluxe skin tho.
[0:59:10] <KTDelgado> YEA YEA YEA SHY
[0:59:10] <+gsdakatsuki> Mag needs bubble shield for herself to deflect bullets
[0:59:10] <+M3grim> Mag used to be great against Corpus, but she's trash lately
[0:59:10] <+fireking900> I picked mag first too and I loved her wtf
[0:59:11] <zakti_prime> mag subject to much dev reworkinng
[0:59:11] <+Ondartyr> Mag is really strong but requires a bunch of mods to be
[0:59:12] <+M4T1A5> mag was super broken at one point but other thant that she is kinda meh
[0:59:13] <Worldbrand> Mag's in a perfectly okay spot if you have access to all the shit that makes her great
[0:59:15] <Zbljuv> quiette shys videos are just shitposts
[0:59:18] <%Dingus_Tickler> Doesn't it seem like Mag's kit is just super basic and uninspired?
[0:59:18] <+Bupkis7> Woolie picked all the worst starters
[0:59:19] <Theta_Bug> Hating mag is more like a meme
[0:59:21] <+MajorCrasher> Mag was super OP at some point and ruined farming, then she sucjed really bad, now she's just ok
[0:59:25] <SolitudeOtM> Mag is the worst, Woolie is the worst by association
[0:59:27] <Theta_Bug> Mag is pretty solid in the current state of the game
[0:59:27] <arcadeHemorrhage > shy hates mag
[0:59:27] <IminyourBase> mags are good all the way through the game even til the end people who think mag is shit don't understand her
[0:59:27] <SunsetJack> Do you...?
[0:59:27] <Lysdexic9541> WAOW
[0:59:31] <+Phantom_Jack> @AngriestPat Mag used to be super good against specifically corpus and then she was nerfed into the ground. after that every subsequent change to her abilities made her more useless, this happened....so many times...
[0:59:33] <@BigNaturalMan59> chuuurWdad
[0:59:33] <KTDelgado> THE BEST CONTENT SHITPOSTER
[0:59:43] <Ser_Randal> natural shitposters
[0:59:44] <%D_day> Mag is fine
[0:59:50] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat PILLARS 2 IS GETTING CLOSER PAT
[0:59:59] <+Reaverund> Sometimes its more interesting to play UNoptimally.
[1:00:09] <%maskedriderhero> GET IN THE WOMBAT HOLE MORTYYYYY
[1:00:10] <stigna1> I think honestly, all this stuff is from the fear that the streamers will accidently screw themselves out of enjoying stuff that the veiwers love, and thereby ruin the oppertunity for viewers to empathize.
[1:00:16] <Morsuzado> and when are we going to have another lp with the person playing have a sense of direction?
[1:00:20] <stigna1> Its passion, just sorta misguided.
[1:00:29] <vaan_ratsbane> VAY KEK
[1:00:32] <Ell1ot> i see. i was going to pick her because of robot boobs. i think i'm going to go with Excal because everyone says he's well rounded
[1:00:34] <+bumbletroni> The Flight of the Concords of Australia?
[1:00:35] <Ser_Randal> GET IN THE CAAH MORTY
[1:00:35] <arcadeHemorrhage > mags fine
[1:00:44] <feuddude> vay kekaku
[1:00:50] <+Reaverund> A CHEAKY 30 DOLLAR BOTTLE OF WINE
[1:01:01] <tierney12> WE'RE GOIN TE BENDIGO MORTY
[1:01:02] <+gsdakatsuki> @Ell1ot Excal is a great starter frame since he has so much utility in his tool kit. Mag requires a lot of later game mods to make good
[1:01:05] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat any tips for getting the challenges room mods u need to unlock war within?

[1:01:43] <+M3grim> @angriestpat Why are you going to the Thrax Toxin waypoint...? Only one person needs to grab the toxin, and the next waypoint is super far away. You should just hang out and wait for phase 2.
[1:01:45] <$BenLubar> @AMajorTom I see you've played knifey-spooney before
[1:01:47] <%shivhappy22> Bogans

[1:04:14] <+AntithesisEK> who asked about Gara I got distracted
[1:04:15] <%Dingus_Tickler> Someone should be running around Warframe taxi'ing people, but during the whole mission they're playing all the Offspring music played in Crazy Taxi on their mic.

[1:04:41] <Brozime> hi hi all
[1:04:46] <Skybrid> Since addition of Junctions, game actually guides players pretty well. You just have to pay attention.

[1:05:24] <Worldbrand> The goals are made relatively clear, a lot of the mechanics are about as clear as bricks
[1:05:25] <+M3grim> Pat! Shut up and put in the catalyst!
[1:05:26] <+AntithesisEK> there's still big progression gaps. The importance of derelict mods is understated, rivens coming from sorties isn't very well explained etc

[1:07:16] <$BenLubar> fart really hard
[1:07:17] <zakti_prime> it's from a movie called gaslight isn't it?
[1:07:22] <DarylHall> yeah its the name of a movie
[1:07:23] <%gasgrave> Gaslighting comes from the movie Gaslight
[1:07:24] <Dankgerous> its from the title of an old movie
[1:07:27] <DarylHall> where that was the plot
[1:07:28] <Happyguyelite> @legendfather_of_giants PogChamp
[1:07:29] <DraxTD> [CRAZY TALK]
[1:07:29] <KTDelgado> sure
[1:07:30] <+AntithesisEK> that's an old term
[1:07:30] <+LpD9_2> Because I have forgotten a lot of what I knew
[1:07:31] <fatty_rangel> it's based off a novel
[1:07:31] <Ell1ot> you make the farts and someone else is holding the lighter next to your butt
[1:07:32] <Skybrid> Oh, by the way... Have anyone seen Batman Gaslight movie yet? How is it?
[1:07:32] <SunsetJack> Do you like to travel...?
[1:07:32] <$BenLubar> pat you should got to tem-con
[1:07:33] <stigna1> Fun fact! The term "gaslighting" originated from the 40s! Its not the fault of young people!
[1:07:34] <miracleman6> yes
[1:07:34] <Spekhogger> Gaslight was an old movie where a guy try to make a girl think she was crazy
[1:07:35] <Worldbrand> People probably just want to meet you, pat
[1:07:36] <+MajorCrasher> YES
[1:07:36] <+jestrfestr> Lol
[1:07:38] <+Bupkis7> Yes

[1:07:42] <+fireking900> yo chat what's pat's MR?
[1:07:43] <Brozime> Tennocon is a very good time and also it's in your country which makes it way easier
[1:07:43] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat feel free to inform Plague that Gas-lighting is a term from the 60's.
[1:07:45] <%Dingus_Tickler> You should go to Tenno-Con, but just remember to avoid the homeless person with the dirty syringe. Other than that, you'll be fine
[1:07:45] <tierney12> drink the kool aid you fucc Kappa

[1:08:02] <+AntithesisEK> quickly shit all over it
[1:08:04] <Zombrocom> The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in the 1938 stage play Gas Light, known as Angel Street in the United States, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944.
[1:08:05] <+AntithesisEK> talk about rivens

[1:10:34] <StallordD> Has Pat done CoH or OA yet?
[1:10:40] <+AntithesisEK> I'm on PS4 so my friend who just demolishes content burned through cetus rep with a month and a bit of boosters and I told him how we ALMOST had non-reuseable Bait blueprints @Brozime
[1:10:45] <iusetheinternet> no he hasnt
[1:10:48] <zakti_prime> yeah boi hemocyte fight
[1:10:50] <+AntithesisEK> it would've been an entirely different, tragic story.

[1:11:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> @commanderclaw Because boss fights are an outdated mechanic that video games don't need Kappa
[1:11:30] <StallordD> Ya boi, you need your dumb statues
[1:11:30] <+Phantom_Jack> gotta grab konzu's lunch
[1:11:32] <Worldbrand> It's for a trophy!
[1:11:39] <$BenLubar> I love in video games when something happens and the game uses every single way it can tell you the thing just happened
[1:11:40] <Skybrid> Your lunch for Konzu
[1:11:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> cytolith?
[1:11:44] <zakti_prime> Big gold trophy
[1:11:46] <tierney12> oh shit all the WF content creators are here LUL
[1:11:49] <greatersea> corrosive damage on weapons usually outpaces corrosive projection, tbh
[1:11:49] <+Cobra743> it's for trophies be glad for the grind fuckers
[1:11:51] <+Valison> @AngriestPat You are a useless shit for idiots
[1:11:52] <AMajorTom> Well designed boss fights are a failure of the game design
[1:11:52] <$BenLubar> like in Portal 2 when you start the chapter titled "the part where he kills you"
[1:11:53] <Skybrid> Man, my chat is acting weird
[1:12:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Why don't you just use Archwing
[1:12:08] <StallordD> Same
[1:12:08] <Klefth> How do you access the dojo, btw? ._.
[1:12:10] <reonome> LUL
[1:12:11] <%LocoCrazy_> @AngriestPat Hey. I just subscribed but I didn't get a Discord invite. I'm all hooked up too.
[1:12:12] <%PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat do you have open spots in the dojo
[1:12:14] <stigna1> Hemocyte cystolith. Its named for blood-based immune cells(hemo for blood, cyte for cell) and cysto for bladder/organ part and lith for stone.
[1:12:14] <StallordD> He probably doesnt have a launcher yet
[1:12:17] <%Dingus_Tickler> @AngriestPat Did you see the Mysterious Mod for Street Fighter V?
[1:12:21] <+AntithesisEK> Patrick "The Stall Machine" Boivin
[1:12:22] <Heart0fInk> Is that Plagues Dojo name? Stupid dojo for idiots. Kappa
[1:12:23] <zakti_prime> pat has no archwing launchers
[1:12:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Klefth have to have a clan, then lower left od planet select
[1:12:29] <vaan_ratsbane> Communication > Clan > Enter Dojo
[1:12:30] <+MarshallLee67> the pedophilia is just a bonus - woolie
[1:12:36] <Skybrid> I get 75% platinum discount every other week, I suppose that's where all my luck is going and why I'm such a loser IRL. Can't really complain, though.
[1:12:38] <%maskedriderhero> Woolie has been friends with Pat for years, he needs some downtime from the Fuckboiven sometimes
[1:12:38] <StrawberryBandit> oh no
[1:12:39] <+AntithesisEK> now his pants are off
[1:12:42] <tierney12> plague Kreygasm
[1:12:44] <stigna1> Pat is part of a pretty advanced clan. Its likely that they have the launcher tech, but the foundry segment takes a bunch of time to make.
[1:12:46] <+MajorCrasher> Plague LUL
[1:12:47] <$BenLubar> get to the objective. THIS MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS HATE YOU: 2
[1:12:48] <flamearch13> Squid4
[1:12:57] <+Cobra743> Plauge can we get some more warframe porn?
[1:13:01] <StallordD> 3k runs are TECHNICALLY less effective
[1:13:03] <DantesAnimus> Was that an EVA???
[1:13:08] <StallordD> but minmaxing in this game makes me sick :/
[1:13:08] <Skybrid> Squid1 Squid2 Squid2 SabaPing Squid2 Squid2 Squid4
[1:13:19] <fattyboy067> corrosive is too op
[1:13:30] <+M3grim> Pat...
[1:13:31] <alextrebeken> are weapon polarities random or are they set
[1:13:34] <StallordD> Set
[1:13:37] <Skybrid> Warframe is the most beautiful mess there is
[1:13:40] <+AntithesisEK> He meant EHP
[1:13:42] <%Dingus_Tickler> Seems like stuff that started fine, but as the game expanded, it got way way worse
[1:13:44] <tierney12> +damage Kreygasm
[1:13:53] <StallordD> They've started and quit Damage 2.5 like...three times
[1:13:57] <+MajorCrasher> terrible
[1:14:00] <Zombrocom> It was bad
[1:14:01] <Worldbrand> Changes to physical elements mostly
[1:14:01] <+AntithesisEK> it was gonna be pointless
[1:14:02] <+MarshallLee67> bad
[1:14:02] <lordsmaf> I had to watch the latest Dead To Rights episode, what I miss?
[1:14:07] <StallordD> Damage 2.5 was gonna buff IPS status procs
[1:14:11] <zfenty> it was bad
[1:14:11] <Daniel_Is_I> All of the physical procs were going to be gradual
[1:14:12] <StallordD> Make them do weird shit
[1:14:12] <UvBenServed> It was just changing IPS status effects
[1:14:13] <+AntithesisEK> let us nerf slash but also demand GREATER USE OF IT
[1:14:17] <gunsrlove> @AngriestPat They were going to nerf slash damage
[1:14:18] <Brozime> @AngriestPat it was a bunch of changes to IPS and no changes to mods that would pigeonhole the meta into only slash weapons
[1:14:24] <+Phantom_Jack> @AngriestPat Long story short, DMG 2.5 was going to make guns crowd control and abilities killing tools
[1:14:26] <Zombrocom> Slash nerfed to uselessness, impact had blast procs
[1:14:30] <zfenty> nerf slash
[1:14:33] <+Alex_Sriracha> ELI we dont talk about damage 2.5
[1:14:33] <lordsmaf> I just watched the latest Dead To Rights episode, what'd I miss?
[1:14:50] <tierney12> @Brozime isn't the current meta already just slash weapons? OpieOP
[1:14:51] <ArcticAsylum> Farm Time with Eli
[1:14:52] <zfenty> pat is gone lol
[1:14:52] <+Ciphris> slash only useful for slash based weapons the other two effects didn't matter at all
[1:14:54] <Worldbrand> I'm simultaneously extremely excited at the prospect of a melee system rework and terrified of DE doing it
[1:14:55] <The_Bob_Guy> Damage 2.5 is dead, and that's a good thing
[1:14:56] <fattyboy067> stream chat is not working?
[1:15:07] <+Feltal> LUL this guy talking doesnt know shit
[1:15:15] <+unfoldingchoas> speaking of ignoring peoe, pat ignoring plague
[1:15:17] <+zork990> they need to do a massive re balance of mods
[1:15:27] <StallordD> Relays too btw
[1:15:31] <Brozime> @tierney12 yes but HM is making other weapons use Slash. The 2.5 changes would have eliminated HM significantly cutting down the list of good weapons.
[1:15:47] <InsomniacPersona> heya
[1:15:50] <Brozime> and also would kill almost all non-slash melee weapons
[1:15:54] <tierney12> hunter munitions was a stupid idea LUL
[1:16:01] <+zork990> de uses mods like band-aids and its kind of annoying...
[1:16:02] <+M3grim> @angriestpat Jesus Pat, Forma your aura slot...
[1:16:03] <lordsmaf> weird, chat froze for me
[1:16:05] <+AntithesisEK> the 2.0 felt PURELY like a reactionary attempt at reducing hunmun's presence.
[1:16:09] <StallordD> A LOT of mods were a bad idea :/
[1:16:18] <Brozime> @tierney12 it's making a bunch of weapons not trash so I'd say it's pretty good
[1:16:32] <%Dingus_Tickler> Rap God Eli
[1:16:37] <+Ciphris> HM made a ton of weapons useable
[1:16:40] <tierney12> fucking peculiar mods made me NotLikeThis
[1:17:04] <+Feltal> the problem was the slash procs only did damage based on the amount of slash damage on the weapon, not the total weapon damage
[1:17:09] <StallordD> YEP
[1:17:15] <Skybrid> They wanted to do that at some point
[1:17:19] <Worldbrand> this was discussed, yeah.
[1:17:19] <StallordD> Removal of damage mods should be a thing
[1:17:24] <+zork990> they talked about removing damage mods briefly like 2 years ago
[1:17:26] <StallordD> I think all mods should be weird modifiers
[1:17:26] <Skybrid> But decided not to, because people complained
[1:17:31] <tierney12> because there's a massive market which makes DE stupid money OpieOP
[1:17:34] <gunsrlove> Hey Stallord
[1:17:37] <StallordD> Sup guns
[1:17:37] <+AntithesisEK> We could use more bullet jump mods with purely visual changes. Water, thorns, void energy, etc
[1:17:37] <+zork990> on a devstream
[1:17:48] <Brozime> @AngriestPat they don't do that because associating that with level means they have to refund the investment people have in serration etc. and they don't want to
[1:17:49] <zfenty> Pat is so smart
[1:17:49] <+lassieme> This is a great conversation
[1:17:57] <Skybrid> Players invested a lot into these mods and such
[1:17:58] <purple_bagel> Hey its the spider fucker
[1:18:03] <Laecerelius> I remember them talking about taking out the base damage mods for weapons because there's no reason not to have them and they're just a required used up slot/mod energy
[1:18:04] <StallordD> Good mod - Tether grenades
[1:18:05] <+Ciphris> but pat i love using 6 mandatory mods with no room to make my weapon more unique and fun
[1:18:07] <StallordD> Bad mod - serration
[1:18:09] <+Razputin217> because rivens
[1:18:12] <%Dingus_Tickler> This is what I liked about the multiplayer in The Last of Us. Upgrading your weapon didn't upgrade damage, but it upgraded Reload Speed, Magazine Size, Fire Rate, Scope Speed Animation, etc. Just not damage numbers.
[1:18:13] <Brozime> I also wish that was what they did
[1:18:17] <Worldbrand> That's convoluted and probably shortsighted
[1:18:18] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat It's cause they make money on mods
[1:18:33] <Skybrid> @commanderclaw Doubt it
[1:18:40] <+M3grim> If you would read your chat for two seconds, you'd understand why that's a terrible idea, but you're too busy staring at nothing
[1:18:41] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat Why cant they just have impact damage knock weapons out of enemies hands and have puncture make weakpoints that do more damage if you shoot them
[1:18:50] <StallordD> The CB upgrade system was kinda like that, but still convoluted
[1:18:50] <Laecerelius> Just throw legendary cores at people like after they reverted the steel charge changes
[1:18:56] <Furfurlurd> Ayy @Brozime Hope you get over your sickness1
[1:18:57] <darklegion333> USE AN ARCHWING LAUNCHER
[1:19:00] <+zork990> i feel like everytime they release new mods, the number of mods increases, but the actual mod diversity decreases
[1:19:11] <+zork990> like look theres a billion mods and only like 5% of them are usable
[1:19:12] <+AntithesisEK> what a wild ride the old fusion was
[1:19:23] <zfenty> mod packs are so trash Don't buy them!!!!
[1:19:24] <Laecerelius> new fusion is a lot better
[1:19:31] <+MGKBurrito> @AngriestPat did you know warframe abilities used to be mods?
[1:19:31] <StallordD> Mod packs are blatant traps for new players
[1:19:32] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Yea it was what Endo was previously basically. Endo is better in every way.
[1:19:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> +2% Critical Chance LUL
[1:19:35] <greatersea> @AngriestPat one of DE's ideas for damage 3.0 is to get rid of "staple mods" like the straight damage ones
[1:19:38] <Kaffeebohnson> Does Pat not have any sky archwing charges?
[1:19:39] <tierney12> who remembers uncommon 3 fusion cores? Kappa
[1:19:44] <+Ciphris> they could just make endo usable for the weapon ugprade system pats talking about
[1:19:46] <%machshop> kickback!
[1:19:47] <Kaffeebohnson> Or Plague?
[1:19:47] <StallordD> I remember upgrade trees, lol
[1:20:05] <gunsrlove> So Plague wants to change animations?
[1:20:16] <%Dingus_Tickler> Isn't Lex Prime just a magnum? That's what I remember it being
[1:20:16] <Skybrid> That would cause weapons to lose identity, it's a double-edged sword
[1:20:26] <Laecerelius> after being gone for like 2 years i was really pleasantly surprised at how much nicer endo and void relics are compared to the old systems
[1:20:27] <+AntithesisEK> essentially @Dingus_Tickler
[1:20:37] <StallordD> Fish oil is from fish
[1:20:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> fighing is super fun
[1:20:41] <tierney12> they need to add an animation for pivoting on the spot, like there's been no standing turn animation for 5 years LUL
[1:20:41] <%InkblotBlues> @Dingus_Tickler Pretty much. It has a lot of Puncture damage and that is about it.
[1:20:47] <drakthebest> do max level bounties they give 5 of each resource from each resource node
[1:20:47] <fattyboy067> for some reason stream chat was not working at all for me
[1:20:48] <Skybrid> But all this will probably be considered for Damage 3.0, which isn't a priority right now
[1:20:52] <Brozime> The main issue with doing the "no more damage mods" solution is that fire rate = damage mage size = damage and so on
[1:20:54] <$BenLubar> you buy fish oil from a snake oil salesman
[1:20:54] <%Dingus_Tickler> @AntithesisEK That what I 'member, I also remember the good ole days of Tonkor not dealing self damage @InkblotBlues
[1:20:54] <stigna1> @AngriestPat If you care to, the components are relatively trivial to farm but bullet-jumping like mad is viable as well.
[1:20:56] <zakti_prime> fishing is fun to me
[1:21:04] <Worldbrand> Removing base damage mods alone doesnt really achieve much other than a flat gamewide buff by giving us another mod slot to throw in more damage. It's an obvious solution only insofar as it makes things easier for us by one step.
[1:21:05] <+AntithesisEK> fishing as part of essentially CORE progression is a travesty
[1:21:05] <Brozime> almost everything technically effects damage
[1:21:08] <Laecerelius> reload speed even is more damage
[1:21:15] <%electrokev007> !uptime
[1:21:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 21m 24s.
[1:21:16] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat i really hate how hard they push poe on new players considering how separate from the rest of the game it is- all the poe resources are only used for poe stuff
[1:21:21] <darklegion333> i have 2 fusion cored and barely play the game
[1:21:22] <Heart0fInk> Odd Mods
[1:21:24] <UvBenServed> Peculiar

[1:22:11] <HypeArbalest> Trinity aura print
[1:22:11] <tierney12> if they put the peculiar mods into the exilus warframe slots i'd be ok, but taking a weapon slot is dumb
[1:22:20] <%electrokev007> is plague playing octavia?
[1:22:21] <sunny935> trinity helm
[1:22:26] <SolidChozo> It's basically to show that your power level is so high that you can grow flowers
[1:22:28] <Sielas> @AngriestPat Yo, have you played Path of Exile? The Warframe of ARPGs
[1:22:42] <StallordD> There needs to be a dedicated Peculiar slot
[1:22:44] <greatersea> trinity helmet alert
[1:23:01] <HexMasterMike> I would absolutely run goofball shit for memes
[1:23:06] <%maskedriderhero> They should include a program that causes Vey Hek's voice clips to ignore any sound levels or other programs over top and play at max volume over all other programs
[1:23:11] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat but it's not optimal pat
[1:23:12] <Fynale> why not just give them seperate mod slots
[1:23:24] <Goergorion> If it give polarity instead of taking it would be less painful to use
[1:23:26] <urs0jb> the perculiar mods are not meant to be meta, they are just useless fun
[1:23:28] <StallordD> That new simulacrum onslaught upsets me from a lore standpoint :/
[1:23:32] <StallordD> I wanted Void portals
[1:23:41] <tierney12> if you run a 269% strength banshee with energy conversion and die every 10s you can use a peculiar mod Kappa
[1:23:54] <+MarshallLee67> pretty much every weapon uses all 8 slots- there are very few that you could probably sacrifice that slot without significant strength decrease
[1:24:00] <Skybrid> @StallordD Same here. Also... it's too much of ORANGE>
[1:24:15] <StallordD> DONT TOUCH MY PROVA ;_;
[1:24:28] <tierney12> @StallordD the original john prodman LUL
[1:24:59] <Ell1ot> What should i expect from not buying the Premium currency? Will there be a wall that the game expects you to throw money at?
[1:25:04] <akibafoxhound> yes it is
[1:25:04] <Goergorion> They will take John Proddman's prova from his cold dead hands
[1:25:05] <StallordD> nope
[1:25:12] <Blue_Tunic_Link> Galatine Prime is the best melee weapon period, minus quick melee
[1:25:15] <sunny935> prime blade is easy to get @AngriestPat
[1:25:16] <StallordD> Warframe doesnt have a money wall
[1:25:17] <+Razputin217> the blade is the easiest one to get
[1:25:20] <Skybrid> Machetes aren't in the same category as scythes. Not with the new stance (Cyclone Kraken), and all weapons of this type aside from original Machete are viable.
[1:25:22] <StallordD> Just a money hike, haha
[1:25:28] <Zombrocom> I dunno, atterax is prob better overall
[1:25:37] <GodlyLuigi> enjoy the timegate that is getting keys for mesa parts
[1:25:37] <tierney12> @Blue_Tunic_Link (cough) plague kiprath (cough)
[1:25:43] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Are you going to make an Ironclad Rhino build?
[1:25:44] <HypeArbalest> @AngriestPat Would you prefer a rhino prime neurotics for Steel
[1:25:44] <Skybrid> Scythe stances are awful, though. So I don't mind transition to heavy blades.
[1:25:56] <StallordD> I like the Stalker scythe stance
[1:25:59] <StallordD> throwing the scythe is fun
[1:26:01] <+MarshallLee67> i used a scythe zaw and it was so awful- the moveset is absolute ass
[1:26:17] <+TootPirate> @Ell1ot No, Although the main thing that people use their starting currency (75p) to buy slots for warframes/weapons, which you have a limited space of.
[1:26:17] <+AntithesisEK> I don't think Pat knows what the augments are
[1:26:24] <+AntithesisEK> Dargins
[1:26:34] <+Ciphris> scythes root you in place and thats awful in this game
[1:26:36] <Goergorion> sickles and scythes are what you mean @AngriestPat
[1:26:46] <+unfoldingchoas> Scythe dont look like scythe there all kamas
[1:26:49] <+MarshallLee67> why is dargyn so funny, is it a reference i don't get
[1:26:55] <StallordD> Its close to dragon
[1:27:05] <+AntithesisEK> it's like saying dwagon
[1:27:09] <stigna1> Man, every time iron skin tanks through a knockdown it makes me sad. Like when people use shields in dark souls. Or don't get one-shot by literally everything in dark souls. #zerovitalitybuildlife.

Against 19 of the monster the Kirin Lance is significantly better, against 8 it is very slightly worse, and against 4 its worse all together.

[1:33:47] <%machshop> @Skybrid but that's for losers i want to be the big man
[1:34:01] <Skybrid> @machshop We are all losers. Registered losers.
[1:34:01] <%Dingus_Tickler> You know it's actually real Southern US accent because Plague is genuinely offended
[1:34:02] <deviljhojho94> are they talking about pat's racist alphys accent?
[1:34:04] <Worldbrand> i'm garbage da ba dee da ba di
[1:34:15] <Heart0fInk> @maskedriderhero You should play Oblivion or Skyrim first. Morrowind if you're brave/hate yourself
[1:34:22] <DantesAnimus> filled with nice people and garbage kitties
[1:34:25] <Goergorion> And scary hockey players
[1:34:25] <%slimcinnamo> @AngriestPat Too late Pat I have already put hours of time into the game. And I didn't put a dime in it.
[1:34:26] <stigna1> HEY!
[1:34:31] <+Razputin217> Alphys would probably like this game, its very Anime
[1:34:32] <+fireking900> America is trash tbh
[1:34:40] <+fireking900> were on fire rn
[1:34:41] <+Robotface174> canada rules. i wish i lived there
[1:34:45] <deviljhojho94> Alphys woud dislike it cuz there is no farming
[1:34:53] <+Bupkis7> NO ITS FUCKING NOT
[1:34:54] <%shin_garbage> literally everywhere sucks
[1:34:57] <stigna1> Canada is a lovely place, and I will be mildly disapproving if you say otherwise, eh?
[1:34:58] <deviljhojho94> Says the fucking FRENCH SPEAKER LUL
[1:34:59] <Heart0fInk> Oh America is a fucking shit hole.
[1:35:02] <zfenty> America is the best
[1:35:04] <DantesAnimus> there are very few places in the world that aren't trash...because humans live in all of them :>
[1:35:05] <Skybrid> I'd take Canada over Russia any day, even with all your crazy SJW people.
[1:35:07] <%shin_garbage> why live when the earth is trash
[1:35:14] <+McSoliace> Most americans know they live in a trash country
[1:35:15] <fattyboy067> Pat barely speaks french though

[1:35:17] <FadingEmber> Are whips better than scythes?
[1:35:21] <%slimcinnamo> @AngriestPat What part of the time cube is Paige from?
[1:35:22] <Zbljuv> europe master race
[1:35:23] <%MultipleJiggs> Just be normal and call it soda
[1:35:24] <Worldbrand> don't parts of europe have that problem with sparkling water?
[1:35:24] <+AntithesisEK> to be fair there's still plenty of dry counties in the south
[1:35:24] <deviljhojho94> Canadians barely speak french in general
[1:35:26] <StallordD> Whips ARE better
[1:35:27] <Kipss> its bazongers?
[1:35:27] <+Robotface174> boissons!
[1:35:28] <stigna1> LOL Americans.
[1:35:29] <%DoctorPavel4U> Oh man pat, the UK has about 50 different ways to say goddamn batch/bread roll
[1:35:33] <StallordD> Atterax and scoliac

[1:36:01] <Worldbrand> ah yes can you get me a bazelgeuse
[1:36:06] <deviljhojho94> Have you ever heard the saying, dont come to brazil? Well, don't come to Mexico. I care about you guys
[1:36:09] <Heart0fInk> I want to drink some bazongas
[1:36:18] <StallordD> To farm Iradite, start a high level bounty and run to the far side of the plains, they drop a bunch
[1:36:28] <Skybrid> Anyone who prefers memeing strike meta over proper melee combat is dead to me
[1:36:34] <StallordD> Agreed
[1:36:38] <Fynale> except ff14 has eureka now which is basically plains but with hunts
[1:36:55] <+MarshallLee67> "there's mining?"
[1:37:04] <deviljhojho94> We minecraft now
[1:37:06] <Skybrid> Just mine your business, Plague
[1:37:08] <Fynale> Wikiframe
[1:37:17] <faegbeard> Warframe: Look it up, idiot
[1:37:19] <Heart0fInk> Mineframe Kappa
[1:37:24] <Joogahai> Warframe: Ninjas Check The Wiki
[1:37:25] <Laecerelius> Warframe? More like Wikifarm, am I right?
[1:37:33] <Goergorion> "Codex Plz"
[1:37:37] <+Razputin217> theres a dude in Cetus thats all about mining
[1:37:42] <Skybrid> Warframe tells you a lot, often exactly when you need to know it. If it were to tell you everything at once, your head will explode.
[1:37:42] <%shin_garbage> Mining in this game fucking sucks
[1:37:45] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat hey pat and plauge the last upgrade for the mining lazer just shows you where the ore is on the mini map
[1:37:47] <+KSabot> 10 beeblebroxes until I get my zaphod
[1:37:50] <+Ciphris> Warframe: ninja nerds reading the wiki
[1:37:53] <%LocoCrazy_> Pat. Pat you're not deep into the game. You're not even 500 hours in. The proper tutorial has yet to start.
[1:37:57] <KingOfIronFisting> Good ol' baphmodads
[1:38:04] <StallordD> Orokin Principle Rooms are just everywhere
[1:38:06] <%shin_garbage> Have fun looking for a blue spot on a fucking rock
[1:38:08] <StallordD> theyre marked by blue banners
[1:38:08] <Skybrid> What I've noticed with a lot of streamers, they don't listen to exposition and explanation, so yeah. It's not always game's fault
[1:38:09] <TheSpartanThief> Here's a secret Pat: we ALL are checking the Wiki
[1:38:12] <+AntithesisEK> they are randomly set tiles
[1:38:14] <Shpooka_Dooka> This game just needs a direct link to the wiki in the pause menu.
[1:38:25] <SpaceCatStation> @angriestpat random tile sets
[1:38:26] <+Timesteel> do mobile defense they spawn practically on every point
[1:38:34] <Fynale> warframe is a real life simulator the world doesn't tell you shit and everyone has to check the wiki
[1:39:02] <+GreatBrightBlack> I'LL JUST GET FRIENDS FROM THE FRIEND TREE
[1:39:04] <%LocoCrazy_> @Fynale There is an unnerving amount of truth to that.
[1:39:15] <Worldbrand> you can use a specter, a decoy and spoiler mode
[1:39:17] <+AntithesisEK> Loki or Saryn + spectres
[1:39:24] <+MajorCrasher> Loki doesn't mind control
[1:39:37] <+Razputin217> Nyx does
[1:39:38] <Skybrid> You can say "Operator", why cover it by "Spoiler mode"? No one will understand anyway.
[1:39:43] <+gsdakatsuki> Pat Crazy Talk activated?
[1:39:43] <clonexsniperx> i feel like instead of wiki its now youtube since who wants to read
[1:39:52] <+Ciphris> is pat just doing that cause it's cool
[1:40:05] <+fireking900> not like the undertale community LUL

[1:40:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 40m 32s.
[1:40:32] <Worldbrand> the new gamemode's supposed to help with that too, so here's hoping
[1:40:41] <+jestrfestr> game mode they are adding "next week" will be good for focus too
[1:40:46] <Rentixx> Has Pat did Chains?
[1:40:47] <Tucker0603> i run Unaru but i have all rage loadouts
[1:40:52] <Heart0fInk> Modern warframe. Oh God if there was a COD like warframe brownCRINGE
[1:40:55] <Skybrid> Warframe, now with Diablo's Greater Rifts
[1:40:59] <+fireking900> just hum the Kirby theme
[1:41:03] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat here's a question do you know what arcanes are
[1:41:07] <SpaceCatStation> people use their operators all over the place. I'd say it's just safer to avoid spoilers for the means of getting the operator
[1:41:09] <stigna1> @Rentixx He's not run those mini-quests at all.
[1:41:17] <%shin_garbage> MATT AND PAT
[1:41:21] <+unfoldingchoas> On xbox the Vauban system is up on the alert,8 MINS

[1:41:36] <%shin_garbage> LEARNING AND SHARING AND JUNK
[1:41:39] <Kratok> *play together
[1:42:00] <%shin_garbage> ONE IS NICE
[1:42:00] <%LocoCrazy_> One is nice. And the other one is less nice but who couldnt love Matt and Pat
[1:42:08] <mcevers> excalibur + radial blind + backstab
[1:42:15] <stigna1> @whomever asked that; status effects are very good at this stuff. I.e blinding stuff.
[1:42:17] <+Ciphris> are they even friends anymore
[1:42:17] <%shinigami40297> excalibur blind and finish damage cheeses all the junctions
[1:42:17] <%shin_garbage> AND THE OTHER ONE IS LESS NICE, SO WHO COULDNT LOVE MATT AND PAT
[1:42:18] <+unfoldingchoas> Vauban system is up on the alert, on xbox one
[1:42:24] <Kratok> Best friends play - Together!
[1:42:25] <+Timesteel> I just stun locked most of the junctions bosses to death with frost’s #1
[1:42:39] <Klefth> I had trouble with a junction once. Then I used Exalted Blade.
[1:42:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> Project M?
[1:42:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> Slash is best for the Jupeiter junction, ignores shields
[1:42:56] <%Dingus_Tickler> Thank you
[1:42:57] <reiju_22> project M for sfv
[1:42:58] <SolidChozo> Mysterious mod looks to be the project m of sfv
[1:43:03] <Skybrid> A lot of people in Warframe are for some reason afraid to be creative with their builds and stick to meta. You don't need 100% for everything most of the time, have some fun, for god's sake
[1:43:09] <+TheNommad> Pat's playin his warfreems
[1:43:25] <+TheNommad> How far along are ya small redman?
[1:43:28] <Skybrid> 100% efficiency*
[1:43:32] <viewtifulr> they took a look and they remove it from existance
[1:43:38] <%Luckdragon88> Is there much difference in the Console or PC version of warframe? i'm considering getting it, but not sure which platform would be best...
[1:43:41] <HypeArbalest> Eli doesnt exist
[1:43:44] <stigna1> @Skybrid Well, for some folks minmaxing IS the fun. And some people just don't wana think about it. But yeah, there's room for creativity.
[1:43:47] <+Shadowthedigger> There for he is 200% goku
[1:43:48] <Skybrid> Pat Prime?
[1:43:51] <+MajorCrasher> who's Eli? Kappa
[1:43:52] <+AntithesisEK> but that is kind of the goal of warframe. Farm better to be better at farming.
[1:43:54] <Meriokingston> hi pat
[1:43:55] <%shin_garbage> console is like 3 weeks away from pc\
[1:43:55] <+M3grim> @angriestpat If you like making things explode with Rhino Stomp, you should play Nova/Nova Prime
[1:43:57] <%captainthunderwolf> Eli, you lost your identity when you showed your face on camera.

[1:44:07] <+unfoldingchoas> Pat isb the Vauban system what you need, it on xbox one, and i think pc and system have the same alert
[1:44:09] <%mad_jacko> It means most of us were closet pervs

[1:44:20] <stigna1> Man, I hate how 3d-printers are called that. Or cell phones.
[1:44:20] <SpaceCatStation> @luckdragon88 consoles are usuallya few updates behind and I think tennogen is different but I might be wrong
[1:44:22] <+Ciphris> they release stuff for PC first before porting to console @Luckdragon88

[1:44:48] <jisang0415> MAKE A VIDEO
[1:44:51] <stigna1> It may be too late, based on ticket availability.
[1:44:52] <jisang0415> PAT AND PLAGUE
[1:44:54] <%LocoCrazy_> Eli just do it.
[1:44:55] <%Dingus_Tickler> LUL
[1:44:56] <%Luckdragon88> thanks guys
[1:44:58] <%maskedriderhero> So wait, Warframe has it's own convention?
[1:44:59] <Skybrid> On a bus across the ocean

[1:45:08] <%Fodderbot> pat and plague may be my favorite duo of anything anywhere
[1:45:09] <tierney12> BOO-URNS BOO-URNS
[1:45:11] <Derkinstacker> Fuck you Pat, i made the same shitty joke in my head.
[1:45:15] <Kratok> Take the plane it's pretty cheap
[1:45:15] <Cobaltor_252> fuckin yuck city over here
[1:45:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Plus you gotta deal with all the musk
[1:45:19] <eco419> Omegalul
[1:45:26] <Heart0fInk> Elons? like the tesla guy?
[1:45:39] <chocolatez3r0> @maskedriderhero yes
[1:45:40] <%LocoCrazy_> Yo I can drive you the rest of the way there. I make that drive all the time.
[1:45:52] <Skybrid> @Heart0fInk I suppose he has made many clones of himself to help with his crazy plans
[1:45:52] <Hmkks> Damn that's one ninja circus by the quest giver.
[1:46:05] <%maskedriderhero> @urmommagey What do they do there!? I can't imagine a convention for a single game, not even WoW has it's own fucking convention
[1:46:12] <Derkinstacker> Says the man that can't drive.
[1:46:12] <1medjoe1> it's further than TO :P
[1:46:21] <SpaceCatStation> @angriestpat what do you think of Limbo? Played with him or with someone else using him at all?
[1:46:22] <Worldbrand> Uh... I could be nuts, but I think london's to the west. so even further away from mtl
[1:46:25] <Skybrid> Warframe is how I learned that there's more than one London
[1:46:27] <+unfoldingchoas> Pat and Plague buy the tenno con pack
[1:46:33] <Criotos> from London area, we are west, so 1.5 - 2 hours further than toronto
[1:46:40] <chocolatez3r0> @maskedriderhero they do a bunch of fun dumb shit :P
[1:46:48] <stigna1> @maskedriderhero Mostly panels about gamedev and various aspects of the community. Some social stuff. It really holds up because the devs are so involved with the community; there's a significant amount of hangout.
[1:46:51] <DantesAnimus> those are always the most dangerous drives
[1:47:14] <+seriousink> no one giving pat archwing pods. smdh
[1:47:15] <Skybrid> @maskedriderhero Minecraft has, EVE Online has, and pretty sure a lot of other games and not only games
[1:47:24] <Kratok> Can't you give people your archwings by shooting the flare at them?
[1:47:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @seriousink he's disabled gifts
[1:47:30] <StallordD> yeh
[1:47:35] <stigna1> Fun fact! Much of Canada is upon the Canadian Shield, an ancient, worn-away mountain range that makes the ground very rock and shallow. I think this is part of Pat's phenomenon here.
[1:47:36] <%LocoCrazy_> Sick burn
[1:47:40] <junipxr> LUL
[1:47:41] <Skybrid> Aaaaah LUL
[1:47:42] <+BoSteed> damn
[1:47:52] <+seriousink> @legendfather_of_giants does that turn off the archwing items that can be dropped?
[1:48:06] <spoofy16> why is pat so familiar with eli's dick?
[1:48:13] <+d00msdaydan> "well anyways, about the little fat thing"
[1:48:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat This quest drops Naramons specifically
[1:48:16] <+AntithesisEK> cantaS plague derives such pleasure from sardonism
[1:48:16] <Skybrid> @spoofy16 Hmmmmmmm!
[1:48:19] <SunsetJack> This bounty ONLY gives this one.
[1:48:19] <+gozzojt27> we all ask ourselves that question
[1:48:23] <sunny935> its in the loot table
[1:48:23] <Kratok> @AngriestPat look at the drop table, pretty sure they just don't drop on this quest
[1:48:24] <Laecerelius> Only naramon drop from the plague star bounty
[1:48:24] <drakthebest> I get nothing but naramon lens' because they drop from fucking everything like candy
[1:48:32] <+jestrfestr> bounties will get you more lenses @AngriestPat
[1:48:40] <%Nonsubcasual> they will make focus a lot easier with the new mode next week
[1:48:43] <+Razputin217> Atlas = One Punch frame
[1:48:44] <%electrokev007> TROUBLE FOCUSING, YOU SHOULD GO TO A CONCENTYRATION CAMP
[1:48:52] <%electrokev007> oh god the caps
[1:48:58] <%electrokev007> i<m sorry
[1:48:59] <gunsrlove> Well
[1:49:02] <+gozzojt27> rip draco
[1:49:03] <MMetas> @AngriestPat Farming focus and zaws is like starting crafting in ffxiv, You have a whole new skill set to learn and things to kill
[1:49:04] <gunsrlove> That's just Scott
[1:49:08] <gunsrlove> who hates farming
[1:49:24] <Worldbrand> i mean honestly i'd love if we got a different, dedicated farm that wasn't stealth
[1:49:30] <%Nonsubcasual> focus will be a lot easier with the new mode comming next week
[1:49:37] <Ixiah> wow FINALY plague is here to explain Baby Pat how the Game works :D
[1:49:37] <Zbljuv> yes they can
[1:49:38] <%maskedriderhero> Is this game just running and flipping?
[1:49:42] <+AntithesisEK> yes
[1:49:43] <+BoSteed> The Wall LUL
[1:49:44] <DuskMarach> naramon lens just happens to be the drop for plague star, naramon lenses are the only drop for the first objective because people were just doing that one, dropping quest and restarting
[1:49:45] <Zbljuv> they have been doing it for years
[1:49:47] <MMetas> The wall
[1:49:49] <stigna1> @Worldbrand Try doing tri-eidolon runs. They get focus SUPER FAST by converting eidolon shards.
[1:49:54] <Ixiah> and shooting while gliding
[1:49:56] <MMetas> and then he had a 2nd boss
[1:49:56] <+MajorCrasher> @AngriestPat Focus can't work that way because you don't get focus passively because of lenses and convergence orbs
[1:49:58] <MMetas> pippin
[1:50:03] <stigna1> I remember this from the podcast!
[1:50:05] <Skybrid> They said that they don't want people to sit on one place repeatingly doing braindead shit. They want to give engaging way to earn affinity/Focus instead, such as this new game mode
[1:50:08] <Fynale> the father the son and the holy ghost
[1:50:21] <reonome> this is hilarious
[1:50:23] <SpaceCatStation> Raubahn Extreme
[1:50:23] <Mastigias> Oh good, Raubahn Extreme
[1:50:24] <+fireking900> I remember this from the podcast LUL
[1:50:33] <Worldbrand> @stigna1 Yeah I've done dozens and that's fine, but with my setup I still cap out with stealth farms faster
[1:50:35] <viewtifulr> Oh man I remember this from the podcast
[1:50:38] <SpaceCatStation> I leveled RDM to 50 that weekend
[1:50:46] <%DoctorPavel4U> This sounds like the division launch date with the laptop
[1:50:46] <Fynale> it happned again a patch or too ago when the new raid tier cam out
[1:50:56] <Ixiah> @AngriestPat you might need to clam down with the flips :D
[1:51:03] <MMetas> This is what I like to watch, pat doing glips in his ninja robot while serious stuff is happening in game while talking about the toughest fight in ffxiv
[1:51:04] <Worldbrand> Shards not counting towards the cap is nice though
[1:51:20] <%LocoCrazy_> Sounds like eating an American cheeseburger while riding a Chinese motor cycle. It fell apart.... then it fell apart again.
[1:51:21] <reonome> gee maybe you should have taken this into account
[1:51:25] <stigna1> Yee, and its nice to have some options.
[1:51:47] <MMetas> It's like a mini podcast
[1:51:48] <$Kriegmeyer> Sup Pat scrubCute /
[1:51:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> economic game Theory, not Matpat
[1:52:02] <Skybrid> I'm proud of my post Adarza-Operator nerf 5x Hydrolyst caps in one night, highlight of my gaming... career?
[1:52:12] <17sevens> No, that's not how game theory works at all.
[1:52:12] <Worldbrand> this is precisely the problem with people who merge during traffic for no reason
[1:52:16] <+gozzojt27> no, never, IMA DO IT
[1:52:22] <stigna1> Hey, its the prisoner's dilemma! Part of the whole greater-good-thing occurs over time with a bunch of repeats.
[1:52:30] <Kratok> One of the biggest issues in this situation is the MMO becomes so massive that people stop properly relating to eachother, they don't think about the group at a size
[1:52:33] <%captainthunderwolf> I'm in school for this stuff, and Pat's... close enough.
[1:52:34] <stigna1> So the first few days of MMO don't really give that.
[1:52:35] <+Ciphris> i went and did something else myself and had a level 60 red mage to do the story with :)
[1:52:36] <Heart0fInk> the phrase 'Game Theory' has a stigma of insane rambling and talking about purple guy from FNAF
[1:52:43] <%captainthunderwolf> He's pretty tangentially aligned with the idea of the concept.
[1:52:59] <stigna1> Game theory! Sans=Ness!
[1:53:05] <Kratok> "Humans in large groups poison eachother, physically, mentally, and socially"
[1:53:11] <Jake_the_Bear91> but thats just a theory
[1:53:32] <stigna1> Hey, that's not fair! Humans are, in general, great to other humans! Its just the negativity is more visible.
[1:53:39] <prismaticsnake> yeah, I saw that one
[1:53:54] <Kratok> It's in very large groups
[1:54:03] <reonome> MURDER EVERYTHING
[1:54:07] <DRAGKUDO> when did Destroyman get into Warframe?
[1:54:26] <Medicwine> why does pats space ninja look like a Summon Skull from yugioh lol
[1:54:42] <SpaceCatStation> oh god it really does
[1:54:44] <stigna1> Hah, that's a great line!
[1:54:46] <MMetas> off the boil pat
[1:54:47] <MMetas> lol
[1:54:54] <$avarice99> I love the cape too
[1:55:01] <%captainthunderwolf> Oh man, Pat really is rocking a Summoned Skull paintjob.
[1:55:06] <%captainthunderwolf> Good eyes.
[1:55:07] <Laecerelius> rhino can hang on the boil all he wants as long as he has iron skin up
[1:55:16] <miracleman6> haha i knew it was reminding me of something
[1:55:34] <Skybrid> Nothing has endless replayability, not even your dick
[1:55:37] <Skybrid> That's a simple truth
[1:55:41] <%captainthunderwolf> Yeah, I was actually thinking a bit about the Archfiends, and that's what.
[1:55:43] <HypeArbalest> Stop playing until new stuff comes out
[1:55:43] <%captainthunderwolf> *why
[1:55:43] <bbjohnny1> stop playing, get back when new content comes back
[1:55:44] <Worldbrand> Yeah, that's the advice I give out. Stop playing, come back when the next update hits. Lots of people do that.
[1:55:48] <%deadpalvgz> I help new players
[1:55:51] <Skybrid> Sane person should know when to take a break
[1:55:52] <%maskedriderhero> Dwarf Fortress has endless replayability
[1:55:52] <%deadpalvgz> formaing old stuff
[1:55:53] <reonome> what's "stop"?
[1:55:55] <%deadpalvgz> and helping newbs
[1:55:56] <+gozzojt27> you cant make me have a life tho
[1:56:03] <Medicwine> now plague is the one making up words
[1:56:04] <%deadpalvgz> that's all I can do anymore
[1:56:15] <Kratok> I hate waiting a week for a new tv episode, I can't imagine being in a situation where I do that for a videogame
[1:56:20] <+gozzojt27> ya, helping people is actually fun
[1:56:22] <%captainthunderwolf> The problem is that a lot of obsessive players are that way because they use it to supplement socialization, to relieve stress, or to fill time in empty schedules.
[1:56:26] <%deadpalvgz> I LOVE playing this game
[1:56:26] <+MajorCrasher> yeah I don't understand why people can't understand not playing a game if you finish or get tired of it and coming back to it later.
[1:56:29] <%deadpalvgz> but I have 0 things to do
[1:56:31] <Laecerelius> that's what i did with ff14. play the catchup a month or so before the new expansion, play the expansion until it gets to the repetative endgame, then wait for the next expansion
[1:56:35] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> This mission is actually real neat
[1:56:43] <%deadpalvgz> outside of helping newbs
[1:56:43] <%captainthunderwolf> And for all of those kinds of people, the singular, working solution, is more attractive than the idea of a healthier, wider stable of habits.
[1:56:55] <%Nonsubcasual> my situation for the last year of warframe.. been wathcing more than actually playing
[1:57:02] <Skybrid> If something that is meant to provide you enjoyment doesn't do that anymore, then just stop doing it. Easy as that. Or find a new way to do it, you'd be surprised how many things there are you haven't tried.
[1:57:02] <Worldbrand> I guess it doesn't help that games naturally serve instant gratification and reap monetary benefits from being designed that way
[1:57:02] <%captainthunderwolf> Because in each of those cases, there is NO scenario where it would be more appealing to spend their free time elsewhere.
[1:57:16] <Medicwine> yea my dad played like a bajillion hours of DDO and at a certain point of grinding out every last bit of content it bame a chatroom of sorts.
[1:57:17] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Warframe has a lot of players that want more Warframe because they don't like anything else. They can't go anywhere else and they finished everything. Makes me glad I like other games
[1:57:18] <KitsuneManami> You guys are NEEERDS! screw this Im going to go play 10 more hours on MHW
[1:57:21] <KitsuneManami> :P
[1:57:24] <+fireking900> WoW got close
[1:57:38] <+Phantom_Jack> oh god, not the 'Hey! i chose to spend an inordinate amount of money on the game, you need need to listen to my opinion'
[1:57:45] <AoG_JarlRaven> MMO locusts what a rad title
[1:57:48] <Kratok> I was a locust once!
[1:57:51] <%deadpalvgz> Warframe has ruined me for playing other games and enjoying the gameplay in them.
[1:58:00] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> munch munch munch
[1:58:02] <AoG_JarlRaven> I want to be a MMO locust! Dont like MMOs though
[1:58:07] <%deadpalvgz> The actual movement system in warframe feels so much better than any other game.
[1:58:23] <%TheNommad> @Brozime ho shiiit your in here?
[1:58:28] <%TheNommad> *you're
[1:58:35] <%Remery_> YOU GAME TO HARD
[1:58:39] <%Remery_> SLOW DOWN
[1:58:48] <Laecerelius> Man, I've only spent 500 hours on this game! It needs more content!
[1:58:50] <Fynale> game dev talk is fucking great to me i was gonna go take a nap but fuck that i'm listening to cool shit
[1:58:54] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> CONSUME GAME CONSUME GAME
[1:58:55] <AoG_JarlRaven> When that G rank hits though
[1:58:57] <fattyboy067> MHvets are too used to the versions that came to the west that always had G-rank instead of the jap release versions that don't initially have them
[1:59:01] <+fireking900> 160 is baby shit tho
[1:59:19] <%badmr7> yeah, but try telling them that
[1:59:25] <%drabberfaun535> i remeber being angry when they changed focus the first time
[1:59:29] <%mad_jacko> That’s why I’ve stopped playing till it expands more
[1:59:33] <ociato> They totally designed MH World as a game you drop in and out of whenever there is an update too
[1:59:45] <+MetroidHunter26> I'm at 500 hours now and I still have fun with MHW and I have 2k hours in Warframe and still like to play I just don't play as long anymore now
[1:59:55] <+gozzojt27> as someone whos finished everything in warframe, cetus and venus [whenever it comes] are amazing for that
[1:59:55] <%commanderclaw> The trick is to play more than 1 game
[2:00:06] <Kratok> Have you ever eaten a cake, and you wanted to eat some more of it, but someone told you 'here's a picture of the cake you want, wait a week and you can have it'
[2:00:12] <%Remery_> I was like that with For Honor got 1000+ hours in, but I think halfway through I just started playing vs AI
[2:00:19] <cafeoh> WAIT WHAT
[2:00:30] <%captainthunderwolf> Extra Credits, known accomplices of the fiends of AAA.
[2:00:33] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I don't understand those vets. I still have fun fighting the new additions to the series. 350 hours of playtime in 2 and a half months, and I still do my daily's and some more hunts for the hell of it.
[2:00:39] <%captainthunderwolf> Have they eaten babies? Dubious but likely.
[2:00:39] <+FragmentNation> eve?
[2:00:42] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:00:43] <Skybrid> @captainthunderwolf They really suck
[2:00:45] <cafeoh> You can take those?!
[2:00:55] <fattyboy067> or Classic WoW
[2:00:57] <+Valison> BDO is alsoa sandbox
[2:01:02] <SweetCheeksTrap> Black Desert too?
[2:01:02] <+Valison> so is Runescape
[2:01:06] <SweetCheeksTrap> Yeah
[2:01:14] <$SGrim> @FragmentNation Eve online. Space cult for ship nuts.
[2:01:15] <+LpD9_2> There's also RuneScape
[2:01:20] <SweetCheeksTrap> BDO is like fantasy EVE and it's boring as fuck
[2:01:25] <%captainthunderwolf> @Skybrid Mass outcry when you defend lootboxes? Thas' wha happuuunnn.
[2:01:29] <Jmann1892> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot hashSip
[2:01:33] <Kratok> Isn't Runescape a hard quest basis
[2:01:34] <+FragmentNation> got it I was just wondering if thats the one he was talking about
[2:01:35] <+Valison> Archage is also a sandbox
[2:01:36] <Laecerelius> I got tired of Black Desert pretty quickly but then again that was at launch. it might be better nowadays but ehhh
[2:01:52] <BTRNDL> Ultima Online pvpRad
[2:02:05] <+MajorCrasher> Black Desert is a sandbox purely because it has no content lol
[2:02:05] <stigna1> HAH! "Sandbox" black "Desert." Nailed it!
[2:02:08] <+Templar15> Runescape's a content game, just a hilariously long one.
[2:02:11] <Skybrid> @captainthunderwolf I could respect their position if their argument weren't so blatantly one-sided, indicating bias on their part.
[2:02:14] <tierney12> What about GTA: Online?
[2:02:16] <%captainthunderwolf> Minecraft is EXTREMELY easy to add content tol.
[2:02:16] <junipxr> @stigna1 moon2XD
[2:02:16] <+Yalre> Mods keep minecraft going
[2:02:17] <%AbnormalEnd> @AngriestPat BDO is a mixture of sandbox and themepark
[2:02:21] <Heart0fInk> Runescape? brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME brownGNOME
[2:02:21] <%captainthunderwolf> That's what it is.
[2:02:22] <SweetCheeksTrap> I played Black Desert just recently and it immediately became apparent that there was barely any actual content
[2:02:24] <Kratok> @tierney12 not an MMO
[2:02:25] <Skybrid> @captainthunderwolf Which they refused to admit
[2:02:27] <+AntithesisEK> tfw so many hours in Terraria cantaFeelsGreat
[2:02:31] <%captainthunderwolf> Minecraft CAN JUST MAKE CONTENT.
[2:02:32] <+HelloImTom08> pat need direction
[2:02:34] <%captainthunderwolf> FOREVER.
[2:02:35] <SweetCheeksTrap> and the whole thing was just an economy simulator in a fantasy world
[2:02:37] <stigna1> Oh man, Terraria is fantastic.
[2:02:37] <+MarshallLee67> i played back desert online for like 8 hours and it was so fucking cluttered i hated it
[2:02:38] <+MajorCrasher> Yeah I don't like sandboxes
[2:02:40] <AoG_JarlRaven> OpieOP need more fun
[2:02:41] <clonexsniperx> pat being a locust
[2:02:41] <Kipss> if you want someone to make your fun for you modded minecraft is basicaly that
[2:02:44] <Kipss> shit is nuts
[2:02:48] <%captainthunderwolf> @Skybrid Agreed.
[2:02:48] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> You could look at Minecraft like like Yahtzee, that it's a creativity tool
[2:02:50] <%Remery_> CONSUME
[2:02:50] <fattyboy067> oh boy Pat is not gonna enjoy Classic WoW
[2:02:55] <Skybrid> @AntithesisEK And then Terraria Overworld gets cancelled
[2:03:05] <+AntithesisEK> I'm not terribly upset about it frankly
[2:03:11] <Kipss> otherworld getting canceled was obvious for a year
[2:03:15] <Laecerelius> Man I fucking love Terraria! Every time there's a big update my friends and i would boot up a new server world
[2:03:15] <stigna1> Friggg, I just drank a bunch of cranberry juice and now my apple is super painful to eat.
[2:03:24] <Kipss> it passed around a ew studios so it was either dying or wouldva been shite
[2:03:26] <%maskedriderhero> I just like MMOs with neat classes and crafting mechanics
[2:03:28] <Kipss> a few*
[2:03:32] <+AntithesisEK> It was pretty obvious creatively split and likely a drain on both/all companies.
[2:03:35] <Kipss> yea
[2:03:43] <Kipss> which sucks because it had cool ideas
[2:03:45] <+fireking900> Tera has that but worse
[2:03:45] <Skybrid> I'm 26 old and I've recently rediscovered Minecraft, with youtubers like Welsknight Gaming. I find these videos relaxing and really enjoy people's creativity
[2:03:49] <Zbljuv> every mmo has a rotation
[2:04:00] <+AntithesisEK> those concepts are easily implemented into terraria 2
[2:04:00] <Zbljuv> FF14 combat is still awful
[2:04:05] <+AntithesisEK> like tower defense encounters
[2:04:05] <Kipss> preetty much
[2:04:06] <+Phantom_Jack> Don't talk to me about roatation simplicity whilst Summoner exists
[2:04:26] <%captainthunderwolf> Path of Exile seems to take Plague's point about Guild Wars 1 to the eleventh.
[2:04:33] <+AntithesisEK> it is unfortunate but I think they can recover and it MAAAY lead to 1.3.6 sooner
[2:04:35] <%maskedriderhero> @fireking900 Tera has Elin, which is great
[2:04:35] <Skybrid> @AntithesisEK They worked on this one for many years, god knows how long another game would take. Which might not even be Terraria or something similar to it
[2:04:39] <%captainthunderwolf> Like, Path of Exile has this incredible ability for ridiculous meme builds.
[2:04:45] <+AntithesisEK> that'd be fine by me
[2:04:56] <tierney12> HEART OF THE CARDS
[2:05:14] <Skybrid> ... Anyone here played Creativerse?
[2:05:14] <+AntithesisEK> IIRC Red was looking for new hires familiar with Unity a while back
[2:05:15] <stigna1> I'm gonna take this chance to shill Divinity: Original Sin II for tactical combat. Its fantastic, great storytelling and very open to player choice.
[2:05:16] <Kratok> @captainthunderwolf The problem is that's buried under 11 layers of other stuff, and the outcome is still a M1 build
[2:05:17] <%captainthunderwolf> I have seen builds built around GENERATING SELF-HARM ORBS when you kill your OWN SPAWNS to regen mana which then deals AoE damage based upon the rate of regen.
[2:05:19] <+Shadowthedigger> And then someone finds the best combination of all those things and that becomes your rotation
[2:05:26] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Starmade is kinda fun sand-boxy, but god damn, I do not have the patience to be an Astrological engineer and space colony administrator. The effort required to make a replica of a Legend of the Galactic Heroes Battleship is not worth it.
[2:05:42] <AoG_JarlRaven> @stigna1 its the fallout new vegas of the gen for me fantastic game
[2:05:55] <fattyboy067> Einstein was stupid, agree Kappa
[2:05:57] <%captainthunderwolf> @Kratok Yeah, it's like a mile far from perfect, but I adore those Rube Goldberg builds with a ridiculous amount of moving parts.
[2:05:58] <%maskedriderhero> I liked City of Heroes/Villains, even if I only played a little of it. I also like that it had no gear besides some small equips that you never saw, that increased stats a bit, so the gameplay was all about working together with other players rather than dominating with your builds
[2:05:59] <KitsuneManami> Thats why Game Grumps will be funnier than TBF but TBF is better in other regards
[2:06:05] <Sloavon> The rules state to love Elmo but I am evil so I will hate Elmo
[2:06:09] <%MisterCrimson> "Creativity is stupid" says the man who makes a living playing and bitching about video games
[2:06:15] <stigna1> @Sloavon But he is good and he is sweet!
[2:06:17] <Zbljuv> there is totally the best build in gw
[2:06:24] <%captainthunderwolf> TBF has a higher ceiling, Game Grumps has more consistency.
[2:06:28] <drakthebest> Game grumps is NOT funnier than TBF
[2:06:30] <%Remery_> Meta slaves
[2:06:33] <drakthebest> Not even close
[2:06:38] <Ixiah> Pat always wants the Kaze no Kama build for every game Kappa
[2:06:42] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat likes Templets
[2:06:44] <Worldbrand> humor is subjective and this argument isnt worth having
[2:06:47] <KitsuneManami> To each their own Drak, dont be a baby about a opinion.
[2:06:48] <%captainthunderwolf> But the Best Friends have gags that will never die, whereas a lot of GG jokes are Arian and Danny shouting silly noises.
[2:06:51] <Skybrid> @Remery_ Moment of silence for these poor folks.
[2:06:52] <zfenty> poor pat
[2:06:55] <%mad_jacko> !uptime
[2:06:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 7m 4s.
[2:06:59] <Kratok> @captainthunderwolf Path of Exile is definitely the game for that, but you just need so much real life experience playing the game to look for it
[2:07:06] <%Solidnick18> this winter storm sucks...
[2:07:10] <reonome> if GG isn't funny why is plague making an animation about them Kappa
[2:07:20] <$BenLubar> 55hp monk
[2:07:22] <+Ciphris> guild wars 2 was extremely disappointing to me the guild wars 1 player
[2:07:23] <+AntithesisEK> rouge the bat tits
[2:07:33] <KitsuneManami> GG and TBF are completely differnt type of humor
[2:07:34] <Fynale> iway warrior ranger
[2:07:37] <Fynale> i fucking remember that so much
[2:07:38] <stigna1> Why are we measuring youtuber epeen length when rouge the bat tits have been mentioned in chat. Come on, folks.
[2:07:39] <%Remery_> How does metas work for mmos? They don't have pro players to guide the playerbase like MOBAS right?
[2:07:40] <Laecerelius> GG has some great moments but I find TBFP to be more consistently funny
[2:07:47] <+AntithesisEK> LUL stigna
[2:07:48] <Skybrid> Still waiting for the Everquest Next Kappa
[2:07:54] <Fynale> i remember monk/necro minion master builds
[2:08:15] <%captainthunderwolf> @Kratok That's why it's a game I occasionally watch but do not play.
[2:08:17] <+Shadowthedigger> @Remery_ They have end game raiders/PVP players. Those are the ones who push the "meta"
[2:08:17] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @Remery_ there's still PVP, and if there is PVP, there's meta
[2:08:19] <%maskedriderhero> Anyone remember the time there was a literal outbreak of a death plague in WoW?
[2:08:21] <Fynale> @Remery_ yess actually they do
[2:08:24] <Sloavon> MLG
[2:08:25] <stigna1> I watched SonicX as a kid. I think it effected me. : (
[2:08:25] <Jake_the_Bear91> the reason why i like tbfp over game grumps is length of an episode
[2:08:26] <+Ciphris> i can't stand gamegrumps when arin is being an asshole because he can't hold right and mash the jump button
[2:08:29] <Fynale> it's more the top players guide the meta
[2:08:29] <Worldbrand> @Remery_ Sure they do. Anything that has a most efficient system will have a meta, as long as anyone wants to abuse that system.
[2:08:33] <%Remery_> Oh yes Pvp i forgot about that
[2:08:38] <+AntithesisEK> Corrupted Blood @maskedriderhero
[2:08:38] <%Remery_> sorry
[2:08:49] <aslfrasle> @AngriestPat Ask Plague to tell you about "55 monks"
[2:08:51] <+NekoNinja13> You might enjoy the etrian odyssey series than pat, and or eli it has you make your own dungeon crawling party, if you can stomach another 3ds game
[2:08:54] <stigna1> Man, the corrupted blood was a good time.
[2:08:57] <+D4C_Trice> I don't like it when GG drops an LP without completing it and I wanted to see them beat secret of mana and link between worlds. also i got fed up with arin and suzy
[2:09:14] <%captainthunderwolf> @maskedriderhero You mean the time people poisoned their pets and used them to commit LITERAL TERRORISM? That was the best.
[2:09:14] <%machshop> i had fun with my 55 monk
[2:09:24] <aslfrasle> ^
[2:09:25] <+D4C_Trice> that Steve-O episode is amazing though
[2:09:36] <+MajorMJ8> What kind of mission are they running currently? its like a free roam relic farm?
[2:09:53] <Heart0fInk> Players will just ruin games. Period
[2:09:57] <+AntithesisEK> event specific mission, has phases
[2:10:00] <%maskedriderhero> @CaptainPileDriver Yeah, and wasn't there also a zombie outbreak once?
[2:10:05] <Malziel> FUCK I MISSED THE START
[2:10:06] <+Shadowthedigger> @MajorMJ8 No, it's go around and do specific parts. Just has chance to drop relics
[2:10:07] <+AntithesisEK> find - defend - escort - kill
[2:10:08] <Malziel> !uptime
[2:10:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 10m 17s.
[2:10:11] <Malziel> FUCK
[2:10:14] <Skybrid> There are too many voices, and everyone wants to be heard. It is hard
[2:10:23] <%deadpalvgz> @AngriestPat DE listens to it's community SO MUCH more than almost any developer I can even THINK of.
[2:10:24] <%maskedriderhero> Also, no other MMO I have ever seen can make a pet class better than City of Villains Mastermind class
[2:10:36] <Tulugaq1> what did i miss
[2:10:36] <Il_r3flex_li> when does plague star come to console?
[2:10:39] <stigna1> Speaking of Min-maxing, fun fact! In (I think) 3.5 D&D crafting a quarterstaff was a free action with the right feats so you could make a build that is focused around spewing out thousands of quarterstaves in an instant.
[2:10:58] <Heart0fInk> Not listening and giving a shit about their fanbase is Nintendo in a nutshell
[2:10:59] <Sloavon> NO U
[2:10:59] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> I actually am in support of the auteurism of game creators, I absolutely believe in intended play, though I acknowledge some wiggle room for exploration is good
[2:11:00] <stigna1> Falling off a cliff? Fill the chasm up with quarterstaves! Its good!
[2:11:03] <+bearulous> 55 monk ss necro farming, those were the days
[2:11:08] <%captainthunderwolf> @stigna1 I believe I've heard of that.
[2:11:16] <%drabberfaun535> The real issue with DE is that they like to ban people for trying to report bugs and trying to submit ideas to fix the game. archwings will never be fixed
[2:11:21] <Cuboid64> yeah, if they don't want to put in transmog that sucks, but it's their choice
[2:11:22] <fattyboy067> Yeah but at some point, you have to realise when you're not the target audience for a game
[2:11:24] <spoofy16> transmogging sucks. function should fit form.
[2:11:24] <Laecerelius> Man 3rd Edition has all sorts of dumb bullshit thanks to all of the tons of feats and prestige classes and whatnot that are put out and not balanced around each other
[2:11:28] <%LocoCrazy_> Game devs are always saying "it's you guys who make this game" when in reality it's the producer/dev. With Warframe it is factually the players who shape it.
[2:11:30] <Laecerelius> it's pretty great
[2:11:42] <Worldbrand> @drabberfaun535 this is literally the first i've heard of any of that. care to elaborate?
[2:11:43] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Have you ever stopped to look at the zones? :P
[2:11:50] <Skybrid> @spoofy16 Someone who has no appreciation for aesthetics, eww.
[2:11:52] <%captainthunderwolf> Wasn't there also a D&D build based around using an attribute buff exploit and a chain of summoning conditions to create a kobold character who could gain stats high enough to LITERALLY BECOME A GOD?
[2:12:05] <+WizardofWazz> in GW i remember farming underworld in a team of assass all with shadow form
[2:12:06] <SweetCheeksTrap> It's super cool that Pat's watching GameMaker's toolkit. I like that channel
[2:12:06] <Laecerelius> yup
[2:12:35] <Laecerelius> you could make an infinitely strong kobold with the right feats at like level 3? maybe it was just level 1, i can't really remember
[2:12:37] <Kratok> WOW
[2:12:39] <%maskedriderhero> There a class combo in D&D that allows you to become infinitely strong and tough thanks to DISEASES
[2:12:54] <KexSad> just joined, what are they talking about
[2:12:57] <$BenLubar> you're missing the most important part
[2:13:04] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat there was a similar thing in anarchy online with low hp builds and absorbs because you could only take 33% of your hp per hit lol
[2:13:04] <$BenLubar> there's another spell that reduces your damage taken by a flat amount
[2:13:11] <UncleCranky> @captainthunderwolf Pun-Pun - its a build that elies on a VERY permissive GM, and a VERY loose interpretation of the rules
[2:13:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Path of Exile lifesteal builds LUL
[2:13:15] <%captainthunderwolf> @Laecerelius @maskedriderhero These are both the best.
[2:13:17] <Kratok> @KexSad 55 monk, guildwars 1 farming build
[2:13:18] <stigna1> @captainthunderwolf I've not heard of that, but the peasant rail-gun is sweet! Arrange a bunch of dudes in a line ordered by their initiative. Then have each one pass an object to the next one over the course of their turn (and 1 turn represents 6 seconds). With enough people you can move things hundreds of meters in six seconds, building enough momentum to launch it as a devestating projectile.
[2:13:28] <zfenty> sounds like arcane guardian and inaros
[2:13:34] <%deadpalvgz> that sounds exactly like nova and the nullifiers in warframe plague
[2:13:34] <Worldbrand> And that's how we got nullifiers.
[2:13:45] <Happyguyelite> Dryer then Chains of Harrow? @AngriestPat PogChamp
[2:13:49] <+Ciphris> they ruined it before releasing guild wars 2
[2:13:51] <%captainthunderwolf> @stigna1 I've definitely heard of that one as well, and that's clever as hell, dude.
[2:13:52] <%deadpalvgz> nullifiers, scrambus, frost eximus
[2:13:53] <+D4C_Trice> did pat shit the bed?
[2:14:01] <Zbljuv> WHENS WITCHER 3
[2:14:03] <%deadpalvgz> grineer disruptor drones
[2:14:08] <zfenty> or just wukong in general
[2:14:08] <%captainthunderwolf> @UncleCranky Pun-Pun, that's what it was. Thank you!
[2:14:09] <%deadpalvgz> ancient healers....
[2:14:11] <+Laycas49> Hey chat, is there a good resource I could use to catch myself up with this game? I haven't played in 3 years. Logged in from seeing pat playing it a couple weeks ago and I'm still so so so lost.
[2:14:20] <UncleCranky> The peasant railgun only works if your GM is utterly unaware of how basic Physics works also
[2:14:28] <%deadpalvgz> @Laycas49 yeah hit up the subreddit for warframe
[2:14:28] <Sloavon> I agree Plague
[2:14:31] <%Solidnick18> you feel me
[2:14:36] <%deadpalvgz> there's a buncha guides on there if you want written
[2:14:36] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @Laycas49 friends octoSad
[2:14:43] <UncleCranky> also good luck hitting anything as a 1st level Peasant, with -4 for improvised thrown weapons LUL
[2:14:43] <%deadpalvgz> otherwise just ask a veteran and they can hopefully catch you up
[2:14:47] <+Laycas49> @Admiral_PopnFresh what are those
[2:14:48] <ArcticAsylum> Nah i dont talk to anyone and im fine
[2:14:54] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Sounds like he needs a Titania ringer to burn down the hemocytes
[2:14:57] <+Jylakir> Hey Pat any plan to play Chains of Harrow in the Future? :)
[2:15:01] <%captainthunderwolf> @BenLubar Flat damage reduction is the most exploitable thing in the world.
[2:15:03] <stigna1> Yeah man, housecats can take, on averale, like six average people.
[2:15:06] <lutefiiisk> WARFRAMU!
[2:15:12] <Skybrid> Out of flaccids
[2:15:13] <Kratok> @Laycas49 I think you can replay the new tutorial quests
[2:15:20] <Worldbrand> @Laycas49 Look up the warframe handbook. There's a link to it on the subreddit somewhere, you'll probably find it if you google it.
[2:15:27] <lutefiiisk> Damn you, Pat. You got me hooked on this crack!
[2:15:32] <Sloavon> fuck you jared
[2:15:47] <stigna1> Fun fact! If you want the warframe reddit icon, the code is r/warframe.
[2:15:52] <TheImmortal70> Aluminium not aluminum pat
[2:15:53] <TheManofManyQuestions> whats the difference between primes and regular warframes?
[2:15:55] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @Laycas49 I hear they a humans that share a mutual desire of their respective companies. Bizarre, huh?
[2:16:00] <%Solidnick18> oh lol
[2:16:05] <%deadpalvgz> I'd love for de to rework armor and health values in warframe so it'd scale at a levle that would make corpus actually scale equally to grineer.
[2:16:05] <%Solidnick18> dwayne
[2:16:16] <Worldbrand> @TheManofManyQuestions Primed warframe have slightly better stat buffs and different polarities, and are acquired differently.
[2:16:18] <Skybrid> @TheManofManyQuestions Visual bling and slightly improved stats, nothing else usually
[2:16:19] <%captainthunderwolf> @UncleCranky Honestly, that sounds a lot more like a utility weapon I would use for breaking walls, opening chests, or generally causing destruction than firing at something I need a successful roll for.
[2:16:25] <%deadpalvgz> @TheManofManyQuestions primes have at least one buff and in the void can give allies and themselves energy
[2:16:28] <Laecerelius> primes have extra polarized mod slots and some better stats but nothign really game breakingly better
[2:16:36] <%deadpalvgz> plus more innate polarities on slots
[2:16:37] <stigna1> @TheManofManyQuestions They have very mildly better stands, come with a few buffs already built-in (that otherwise you can add fairly easily) and have a very minor interaction with some traps that disarms them.
[2:16:44] <+Laycas49> @Kratok The how to play came back somewhat quick my whole thing is I have no idea what I should even be doing. I have most of the planets unlocked fully already except for the newer stuff. But literally all of the equipment I was working on before I quit has been vaulted so I'm almost starting from scratch
[2:16:44] <TheManofManyQuestions> oh god
[2:16:46] <Skybrid> Right, additional polarities too. Which you can add on regular 'frames with Forma.
[2:16:49] <+MarshallLee67> yes dickbutt
[2:16:52] <+MarshallLee67> dickframe
[2:16:54] <Skybrid> Dickbutt Inaros skin.
[2:17:03] <+augurgewalt> Miku octavia <3
[2:17:07] <stigna1> Uuuugh, I despise dickbutt. :*(
[2:17:08] <Skybrid> I meant Nidus*
[2:17:10] <elementofloyalty> Hey its Pat and Fuggins.
[2:17:18] <%Solidnick18> sbfpRichard
[2:17:18] <lutefiiisk> Pat has the top Warframe stream right now

[2:17:26] <KitsuneManami> Duuuur, ah well enjoy the 5$ lol
[2:17:27] <@Mechz71> Pat is the exact wrong person to donate money for that Mirage LP
[2:17:28] <+Shadowthedigger> No we need a Mummies Alive skin for Inaros.

[2:17:46] <Sorry4HavingFun> you had a 2 out of 3 chance to donate to the right Best Friend

[2:18:00] <%deadpalvgz> last i heard it can't actually hit anything
[2:18:01] <elementofloyalty> PoG is lewd
[2:18:03] <Kratok> @Laycas49 ohh relic wise? That's kind of hard to say I forgot what I did. Start doing Plains farming and build up some new relics?
[2:18:11] <stigna1> Hey, you folks here in chat are cool folks. I hope you're all having a great day.
[2:18:14] <elementofloyalty> They have ELMO

[2:18:22] <%LocoCrazy_> @deadpalvgz I used it two days ago. Worked fine for me.
[2:18:24] <+flyingsnakes3> Pat only has the highest warframe stream is because we're all waiting to see if he breaks down and buys crack

[2:18:46] <%deadpalvgz> I loved using redeemer for 40,000 damage
[2:18:46] <ShershahAD> @angriestpat could u rank yakuza series

[2:18:55] <+MajorCrasher> cheer500 Hey Pat relatively new fan of the best friends and your streams. Just wanted to say keep up the great work and just wanted to ask if there's an LP or stream planned for the new God of War.

[2:19:56] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> I don't like imaginary money, I suppose
[2:19:56] <%captainthunderwolf> Yeah, I love money because I want to be able to give it to people.
[2:19:57] <ShershahAD> @sorry4havingfun more like haruka
[2:20:00] <tierney12> why did they give the euphona to banshee and not the fucking sybaris SwiftRage
[2:20:04] <%captainthunderwolf> Because it makes people happy to receive money.
[2:20:08] <SweetCheeksTrap> What's the minimum amount to send a message?
[2:20:09] <DantesAnimus> Money is a work
[2:20:18] <elementofloyalty> :O Is Skelmo wearing a robe?
[2:20:18] <stigna1> @Suetake You can do moves like that by rolling in a direction whilst aiming down-scope. I think its always been around.
[2:20:24] <Worldbrand> you've been able to do backflips since before parkour 2.0
[2:20:25] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @DantesAnimus you know what, you ain't wrong
[2:20:29] <ArcticAsylum> I'm watching robot men backflipping through fire tornados....what?
[2:20:31] <%drabberfaun535> @Worldbrand about a year ago me and my buddy from another hemisphere were playing and understandably the ping was nuts, so the game crashed and he sent a report. he got an error number and so he reported it on the website instead of the pop up. they asked for more info and when he reponded he got banned. he tried to appeal it but then got banned from the site he was on.

[2:22:31] <%waxboard> pat will you be giving battletech a try when it comes out
[2:22:39] <stigna1> @PimpDaddyPrime If that's too lategame, try doing void fissure endless missions; you get resource booster drops as you continue through them.
[2:22:42] <ShershahAD> Wait is that plague
[2:22:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat get a mining laser
[2:22:48] <Ahk_90> yup

[2:23:02] <EVA_Unit02> LUL
[2:23:03] <drakthebest> Bloom in this game is annoying af
[2:23:06] <%trowa_2002> What's the best way to up your MR? I'm 90 hours in and only MR 5.
[2:23:10] <elementofloyalty> WHY?
[2:23:11] <+flyingsnakes3> Buy your space wizard hats.
[2:23:13] <@Mechz71> THEY ARE ALL BAD
[2:23:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat go see the mining guy Pat
[2:23:16] <Worldbrand> All those are fine but color correction

[2:23:27] <elementofloyalty> Bland
[2:23:27] <drakthebest> OH MAN I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD TURN OFF SCREEN SHAKE
[2:23:28] <+Big_Pizza> Ambient Occlusion makes it look GOOD
[2:23:30] <%DoctorPavel4U> Level up weapons/frames/pets
[2:23:31] <+SgtMcMuffen> color correction is actual trash though
[2:23:34] <$BenLubar> plague, do you have a graphics card from 100 years ago?
[2:23:38] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @stigna1 Index is Nep-Neptune, right? And snap, didn't know about Endless resource boost drops, cheers!
[2:23:39] <stigna1> @trowa_2002 You get mastery from leveling weapons/frames/pets/everything. To rank up, just grab everything you can and get it to 30.
[2:23:42] <Kratok> What is wrong with Plagues computer
[2:23:43] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> My computer melts on the Plains
[2:23:47] <%DoctorPavel4U> Some weapons are basically just MR fodder
[2:23:47] <elementofloyalty> "Yurn off the game,it makes it better". - PoG
[2:23:54] <Reckless_Rob> I have evidence your opinion is wrong

[2:23:59] <Volkrotia> I disagree too, Pat max for life except motion blur though fuck that
[2:24:00] <Zbljuv> your rhino has cancer
[2:24:03] <%trowa_2002> @stigna1 Thanks!
[2:24:05] <+fireking900> it might it bad for you pat but youre on a tv playing from a distance

[2:24:17] <%Nonsubcasual> bloom >5%
[2:24:18] <stigna1> @PimpDaddyPrime Its from the Nidus quest, *** get it from talking to ergo glast in relays after doing some other quest.
[2:24:22] <elementofloyalty> Pat has to beak Peach's ass again
[2:24:23] <lutefiiisk> This game is so fucking good. I've been playing it every day for a week now.
[2:24:24] <Worldbrand> adaptive exposure's been fixed for most of the game, color correction and bloom are the only ones that bothers people anymore AFAIC
[2:24:25] <$PimpDaddyPrime> No, leave Plague's audio, I wanna hear him berate us
[2:24:31] <stigna1> Edit: Looks like that other quest is war-within, which is sorta midgame.
[2:24:35] <%whistlehunter> Why is the be right back screen frozen
[2:24:41] <elementofloyalty> Gripes is talking smack?
[2:24:59] <KitsuneManami> No?
[2:25:04] <stigna1> So it may take a while to get to. But the index is amazingly efficient for money, so if you need cash long-term save your farming until you get to that. Plus its fun! And there are some cool mods involved.
[2:25:06] <elementofloyalty> and now this clip is frozen
[2:25:11] <DantesAnimus> everything is broke. :x
[2:25:11] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Is it bad that it's the firs time I noticed Paige in this image has a mustard IV?
[2:25:17] <Worldbrand> please enjoy the mustard IV
[2:25:21] <Sloavon> I love that Plague hates Dark Souls so much that he still plays it to hate on it
[2:25:25] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Man, I got so much more to do in this game still, it's fucking great.
[2:25:27] <elementofloyalty> Blame Paige and her 55 devices plugged in
[2:25:28] <Kratok> OH! I thought the mustard was just a jar flying around and making a mess, but it's a fucking IV drip
[2:25:32] <+pr0at> mustard hek
[2:25:35] <stigna1> @Admiral_PopnFresh I just got that myself. I'm not chill with musterd IVS. :(
[2:25:36] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Real hard to resist the urge to buy that free money tho
[2:25:37] <%Nonsubcasual> @stigna1 and our lord and saviour john prodman
[2:25:43] <lutefiiisk> Is Far Harbour for Fallout 4 any good?
[2:25:44] <stigna1> @PimpDaddyPrime Oh yeah, its great!
[2:25:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I didn't notice it for a while
[2:25:52] <stigna1> @Nonsubcasual All hail prodman!
[2:25:54] <DantesAnimus> My PC is too potato to play this game now >:
[2:25:57] <Kratok> @Admiral_PopnFresh @stigna1 my brothers
[2:25:57] <lutefiiisk> I got a cup from that expansion for my birthday and I had to look up the reference
[2:25:59] <%whistlehunter> @lutefiiisk better than the base game
[2:26:03] <%Thelvl1king> Shouldn’t Paige be bruised from the iv? I thought she bruised easily.
[2:26:04] <lutefiiisk> Great!
[2:26:08] <lutefiiisk> @whistlehunter great
[2:26:09] <elementofloyalty> Mustard is not a main course food
[2:26:14] <%whistlehunter> Except for the tower defense parts of it
[2:26:21] <DoubledOgre> I got held hostage in a 75 minute survival mission earlier
[2:26:24] <Worldbrand> @Thelvl1king That red part of her hand isn't lighting, it's the bruise
[2:26:32] <lab990> hey caht, how is the persona 5 anime? im not going to touch it, as i havent played the game yet
[2:26:34] <Laecerelius> I liked playing the Index during the quest that has it. Haven't played non-quest Index yet, though. Haven't needed money since I'm not doing anything super expensive like maxing out Primed mods yet.
[2:26:35] <Sloavon> oh god I didn't notice that was a mustard IV
[2:26:39] <Cobaltor_252> man persona music is dope
[2:26:40] <stigna1> Fun fact! Several of the community's "meme characters" like John Prodman the badass corpus prod-wielder and Clem the friendly Grakata-user have been incorporated into the game.
[2:26:42] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Yo, so anyone got an Arcane Mag Coil Helmet w/ stats that they just wanna gift me on XB1 or PS4 I won't stop ya'll...

[2:27:30] <SweetCheeksTrap> Hey so what are some of you guys' favorite butts?
[2:27:37] <stigna1> @PimpDaddyPrime Arcane helmets don't stack with modern arcanes, so don't feel too bad if you can't grab one; modern arcanes are pretty sweet. That said, I do use a few arcane helms myself so I guess I'm being a little hypocritical.
[2:27:37] <%shivhappy22> Pat chewing his tide pods?

[2:27:59] <ShershahAD> @angriestpat yo pat where does yakuza 0 fall on ur scale compared to the rest of the series, it's the first I've personally played and i think it's pretty good, though the story has a not so satisfying conclusion
[2:27:59] <elementofloyalty> Tissues
[2:28:00] <MajorCrasher> I totally heard Plague jerking it
[2:28:01] <stigna1> @PimpDaddyPrime But I think that's because I'm dumb and stubborn, honestly you're super fine with modern day stuff.
[2:28:04] <dsauce999> Jetstream Sam's butt is gureato!
[2:28:07] <Worldbrand> wait, it's wrapped AND used?

[2:28:38] <%Thelvl1king> Cookies and cream flavored condoms?
[2:28:39] <%trowa_2002> @Skybrid I found that if you just wait for people to join, it's a bit easier to fight Chroma.
[2:28:39] <sirsirejay> Heeey i finally caught pat playing warframe
[2:28:41] <Laecerelius> I have arcane helmets and i never really use them. i hate having to choose between some super min/maxing and having my character looking the way i want

[2:29:07] <IminyourBase> if you 4/4 it, it's 3k each run
[2:29:14] <Kratok> @GurrenPrime grokdul and blahblahblah, made up farming items
[2:29:15] <Sloavon> THAT SUCKS
[2:29:17] <+Ondartyr> Plague Star has no cap
[2:29:25] <stigna1> @AngriestPat You can check it by talking to Konzu. Larger groups can do it faster, and by mudering four hemocysts you can get a full forma in one run.
[2:29:25] <Laecerelius> plague star doesn't have a cap
[2:29:29] <wak8299> there is no cap for plague star
[2:29:30] <Worldbrand> I dont think plague star has a cap
[2:29:31] <elementofloyalty> WHERE'S THE MEGA MAN TUNES?
[2:29:32] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Plague Star has no cap it's an event
[2:30:04] <junipxr> LUL
[2:30:04] <youngboonk4567> Can i play with you
[2:30:07] <wak8299> you dont get cetus rep
[2:30:08] <%TaifuDragon> There's no cap for Operational Supply, what the fuck
[2:30:10] <Worldbrand> But you dont get cetus rep for doing plague star
[2:30:10] <Laecerelius> does plague star get you ostrum rep?
[2:30:12] <%Thelvl1king> Lies so hard we going to the hotzone
[2:30:13] <UvBenServed> Do you even get cetus rep from plague star?
[2:30:13] <$PimpDaddyPrime> So, what's Plague's Stand?
[2:30:13] <elementofloyalty> YEA YEA YEA
[2:30:21] <%trowa_2002> Hello @forebringer apatBlep
[2:30:26] <AncelDeLambert> there's a cap you can EARN. Just no daily cap.
[2:30:30] <elementofloyalty> 'My being wrongness".
[2:30:41] <dsauce999> Plague just crazy talked himself?!
[2:30:44] <%LocoCrazy_> Have you fought an Eidolon yet, Pat?
[2:30:44] <AncelDeLambert> max amount is like 50000 or something
[2:30:52] <%Thelvl1king> Crazy talk requiem
[2:30:53] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah but Plains has also been out less than a year so 2 times in less than a year is fine?
[2:30:56] <+jestrfestr> zaw parts, mods, snipetron, done then
[2:30:58] <AncelDeLambert> sorry, put another zero on the end of that
[2:31:01] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Plague activates his Stand, "Snake Farm"
[2:31:08] <elementofloyalty> Maggots seek to borrow?
[2:31:15] <Brozime> @AngriestPat I would highly advise you to get about 5 Plague Kripath parts as it's the best Zaw part in the game
[2:31:15] <@Mechz71> MAGGOTS?!
[2:31:19] <drakthebest> You can't trade forma
[2:31:20] <KitsuneManami> [Insert Shity "Plague" Plague Star joke]

[2:31:57] <stigna1> Ze billion is ze metaphor for ze soul. Oops, I made ze bad game.
[2:32:01] <elementofloyalty> Pat has a gut filled with Poo Poo.
[2:32:04] <+Cobra743> their reigniting the white on white race war and i love it
[2:32:06] <%Remery_> Spank him Plague
[2:32:10] <Fanimusmaximus> Pat you are ugly
[2:32:17] <$i_am_therydon> your face is dumb and your butt is fart.
[2:32:24] <Laecerelius> yeah, i got the zaw parts and i might get 10 of each arcane blueprint. i also got the fish parts needed to rank up ostrum
[2:32:26] <%Thelvl1king> Snake farm vs crazy talk place your bets
[2:32:31] <Ahk_90> "You're such I cunt!" "I would love it but no, I'm male"
[2:32:33] <elementofloyalty> (Sarcasm) Pat you're busty phat ass girl is annoying!
[2:32:36] <Cucamabungabu> What shape is plagues butt Ir eally need to know. Please respond
[2:32:37] <SweetCheeksTrap> How much do I have to donate to have my message show up?
[2:32:38] <Laecerelius> wait, why five of the zaw blades?
[2:32:40] <Worldbrand> You may want more than one of the zaw blueprints, but certainly not as many as five
[2:32:40] <sirsirejay> I need to get the plague star arcanes this time when it hits console again
[2:32:42] <$Yakobro> LOL
[2:32:42] <+AntithesisEK> LUL that face
[2:32:43] <AncelDeLambert> which bp?
[2:32:45] <MajorCrasher> ikr
[2:32:46] <diiizle> LUL
[2:32:46] <+AntithesisEK> pause.. What.
[2:32:48] <$PimpDaddyPrime> I think Plague's stand should have the power to turn anyone in a certain radius into a heavily sexualised version of themselves that multiplies their libido by 100
[2:32:52] <stigna1> Pat does not know they make custom zaws, I think.
[2:32:55] <%Phobaws06> why 5?
[2:32:56] <Laecerelius> i got two so i can make the one and two handed versions
[2:32:58] <AncelDeLambert> oh, those
[2:33:01] <MajorCrasher> Sucks ass to buy multiple zaw bps
[2:33:02] <%shin_garbage> my internet is shitting so bad i have to watch in 160p and pat sounds like hes underwater
[2:33:07] <AncelDeLambert> no, Pat, you're buying PARTS_
[2:33:07] <+PraiseTheSun20> OF COURSE MAGGOTS seek to BURROW
[2:33:07] <elementofloyalty> :) I love pat's midget hands.
[2:33:10] <@Mechz71> man I REALLY wish you mic worked last night so I could explain all this to you then
[2:33:24] <AncelDeLambert> keep in mind there is no tassle you get from this event
[2:33:38] <AncelDeLambert> Every Zaw is gonna require Oston standing
[2:33:43] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Has Pat not started his zaw yet? How?
[2:33:50] <Laecerelius> but why five when you can only make two from each strike?
[2:33:51] <+d00msdaydan> he's explaining it in the most roundabout way, the component blueprints are single use
[2:33:54] <Malziel> Because zaws are a pain in the ass? zimeLUL
[2:33:59] <AncelDeLambert> you'll MAKE standing eventually off them, but it's gonna cost to start
[2:34:03] <Worldbrand> I can't see any reason to get more than, like, three.
[2:34:07] <TheSpartanThief> And that's why I only made one Zaw....pokey bit, one-handy bit and a weighty thing
[2:34:11] <Malziel> If only we could, oh I don't know, DISASSEMBLE zaws. :thinkingemoji:
[2:34:12] <NemokillerV> @pimpdaddyprime he's barely done anything w
[2:34:15] <elementofloyalty> blame
[2:34:18] <Worldbrand> One for each weapon type and then one in case they introduce better parts
[2:34:23] <Brozime> @AngriestPat The Plague Kripath makes the best Rapier and Polearm in the game and the other Plague striek makes the best staff iirc
[2:34:24] <Primary_> is he ever gonna level another weapon other than the hek? doesnt he need mastery?
[2:34:24] <AncelDeLambert> zaws, I hear, are the best way to make lots of Oston Standing
[2:34:27] <MajorCrasher> Yes zaws are a pain and only worth it for min maxing
[2:34:31] <+AntithesisEK> What is the name of Plague's stand and can it please be either Bark at the Moon OR La Sexorcisto? @PimpDaddyPrime
[2:34:32] <NemokillerV> @pimpdaddyprime plains related
[2:34:47] <+forebringer> @Brozime Why get 5 of each then?
[2:34:48] <%TaifuDragon> Did Pat do a hemocyte run?
[2:34:52] <AncelDeLambert> no no no, build for your style
[2:34:57] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Gotta be Snake Farm @AntithesisEK
[2:35:02] <elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat Did you watch 'Granny's gone wild"?
[2:35:04] <+AntithesisEK> oh hey not baaad
[2:35:11] <MMetas> @AngriestPat There are two types of BP pat, the one with the white background is used up on creation, the one with the yellow back ground is resuable and will say reusable
[2:35:13] <Malziel> @forebringer Future proofin', 'cause who knows when plague star will be back. NotLikeThis
[2:35:13] <AncelDeLambert> everything but robots suffers from viral
[2:35:18] <Brozime> @forebringer They're making more zaw variants it could be used on and it has the best stat add by far
[2:35:28] <+mikesniderman> love the shirt pat
[2:35:33] <%drabberfaun535> @Brozime im only interested in the mastery should i get five of each as well?
[2:35:37] <Zombrocom> I think fishing is the best way to get ostron standing, catching those mortus lungfish
[2:35:41] <+AntithesisEK> Did they show what the nikana zaw piece will be?
[2:35:41] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I get the feeling I need to sit down and do plague star
[2:35:42] <Malziel> @AncelDeLambert You can trigger any status on anything that isn't status immune
[2:35:44] <sirsirejay> I love that you can name 'em i named my infested zaw magatsu
[2:35:44] <%TaifuDragon> @drabberfaun535 no
[2:35:47] <Brozime> If you only care about Mastery you only need 1 of each strike
[2:35:48] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Man, this zaw talk has really highlighted that Pat has spent nearly 3 weeks just micromanaging the shit out of his frames
[2:35:48] <%vampireinarm> you know youre in there when you have a word document for something
[2:35:50] <wak8299> plague kripath, plague bokwin, and ekwana II Jai is what i run
[2:35:52] <Laecerelius> ahhh so they're gonna make it so you can use them to make more than two weapon types with the plague strikes?
[2:36:07] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat craft 3 parts, put the parts together to build a zaw, blueprints and parts get used up when you craft
[2:36:12] <Lysdexic9541> NotLikeThis
[2:36:16] <SolidChozo> WORDS
[2:36:21] <+AntithesisEK> this is a Plague Quinoa with a Plague Bok Choi and a chai latte on the side
[2:36:21] <Kratok> It is called a LINK Plague
[2:36:22] <tierney12> just use ruhang 2 for everything OpieOP
[2:36:24] <+forebringer> @Malziel @Brozime ah ok I just figured after you had the Polearm & Rapier you were good, cause they'd just add more strikes
[2:36:24] <elementofloyalty> Pat is condescending.
[2:36:37] <Brozime> @Laecerelius unconfirmed but it would be a waste of resources to not reuse content
[2:36:54] <Malziel> @forebringer The other issue is if DE releases new parts that then become best in slot, and your zaw becomes slightly worse. :/
[2:36:55] <elementofloyalty> I need a blacksmith to build a sword
[2:37:11] <%HRDSalami654> Yeah, just keep in mind that the MR comes from just the strike.
[2:37:18] <+forebringer> @Malziel That would be kinda annoying
[2:37:23] <Worldbrand> I think 5 is overkill tbh
[2:37:24] <+jestrfestr> the grips arent great compared to the normal ones
[2:37:29] <%vampireinarm> just get 10 of each type to be safe
[2:37:35] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat you can custom build zaws to better compliment specific frames and playstyles
[2:37:38] <+fireking900> dagger i think
[2:37:38] <+jestrfestr> they are added more zaw types so having extra blades is good
[2:37:39] <Malziel> @forebringer Yeah, imagine zaws pre-plague star, and then the plague parts come out. BibleThump
[2:37:39] <Kratok> @Worldbrand it's because new ones are coming out
[2:37:42] <+jestrfestr> adding*
[2:37:44] <tierney12> i don't think pat cares to much about MR
[2:37:44] <elementofloyalty> *Looking at Gripes head*
[2:37:49] <Brozime> @AngriestPat the handles don't really matter only the strieks have significant stats and they make 2 wepaons each so 3 parts for expansion future proofing
[2:38:00] <Brozime> god I can't type today
[2:38:05] <+forebringer> @Malziel then add some super plague Zaws
[2:38:08] <Kratok> shrieks
[2:38:10] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat There's only two for each of the plague strikes
[2:38:10] <Malziel> zimeLUL
[2:38:26] <Laecerelius> cool. also i heard that the contagion zaw arcane is super busted on a dagger zaw with covert lethality on it. like covert lethality causes the projectile to do way more damage than it should or something like that.
[2:38:40] <%TaifuDragon> But you don't have the best 'weights' to add to it, so you may want to replace your stuff later
[2:38:42] <tierney12> i blame paleo frogs Kappa
[2:38:59] <%vampireinarm> time for the frame rate to eat it
[2:39:05] <Malziel> @tierney12 zimeGrin
[2:39:05] <Skybrid> No, Link
[2:39:11] <+babyacid> strike = mastery
[2:39:11] <Brozime> @tierney12 no bully frogs
[2:39:30] <+mikesniderman> no u
[2:39:32] <elementofloyalty> LEWD
[2:39:34] <Zombrocom> @Laecerelius yeah that's a thing
[2:39:36] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat you can make two of the same polearm, but one can be high speed, low DMG, the other can be low speed high DMG. Or a sword with high crit, low status & vice versa
[2:39:37] <Zbljuv> or a dick
[2:39:37] <Sloavon> make my dick
[2:39:54] <+Clemchower> slash?
[2:39:57] <+mikesniderman> lo
[2:39:59] <%captainthunderwolf> I was not expecting a YuGiOh meta deck reference to pop out of nowhere today.
[2:40:10] <Mrbaconator> i saw someone had the clan tag "super best frames zaibatsu"
[2:40:10] <+mikesniderman> hahahahahhaha
[2:40:30] <tierney12> why would you take high speed when berserker and primed fury exist? SwiftRage
[2:40:32] <mas1992> When is Warframe gonna make a battle royale mode
[2:40:32] <stigna1> I LOVE covert lethality.
[2:40:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> daily max?
[2:40:50] <Kratok> @Mrbaconator that's the canon clan
[2:40:56] <%captainthunderwolf> Paleos are like Trap Cards that are monsters, right? Modern YuGiOh is weird.
[2:40:59] <$PimpDaddyPrime> it's much more intuitive when you put it into practice. chat makes everything sound 1000x more complicated @AngriestPat
[2:41:03] <stigna1> @AngriestPat You can check your standing-gain in the mission progress screen, on the tab on the right.
[2:41:04] <Brozime> @AngriestPat make sure to check that you're not at the rep container cap you might need to cash out before you get more
[2:41:06] <+Clemchower> plague star has no daily cap
[2:41:06] <MajorCrasher> daily cap fir cetus standing
[2:41:10] <tierney12> @captainthunderwolf modern yugioh is weird
[2:41:31] <+Reaverund> Its incredible to me that Yughio is still profitable enough to exist.
[2:41:36] <Laecerelius> i still need to get berserker some day
[2:41:42] <+Razputin217> Pocket sand!
[2:41:42] <elementofloyalty> Wow there very few shits to give between these two
[2:41:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Just get a Hirudo for Inaros.
[2:41:50] <tierney12> yugioh is more popular than ever @Reaverund
[2:41:53] <$PimpDaddyPrime> ok BUT consider the fact that all daggers are trasg
[2:41:54] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat To clarify the stat thing, the third part of your Zaw is essentially a set of trinkets that get strapped onto the weapon. They all have varying changes on the axes of damage/speed and status/crit
[2:41:57] <%captainthunderwolf> YuGiOh actually has like a significant following on YouTube, actually.
[2:41:57] <$PimpDaddyPrime> *trash
[2:41:57] <stigna1> @Reaverund Yo, people are still making Warriors fanart. Like, the book series about those weird forest cats from like 15 years ago.
[2:42:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> make sure you level up nakak
[2:42:06] <$PimpDaddyPrime> There are just "less trash" dagger"
[2:42:08] <ChronoCanti> Inaros is a good boi
[2:42:10] <Zbljuv> WITCHER 3 LP
[2:42:18] <elementofloyalty> Jho
[2:42:22] <+ruddyredbone> hardly time limited since they brought it back
[2:42:26] <GurrenPrime> god everytime i learn more about warframe i get confused
[2:42:27] <%captainthunderwolf> I've been watching Rank10YuGiOh's vids recently, and holy shit are there a bunch of archetypes Konami just did nothing to make the work.
[2:42:33] <elementofloyalty> Oh jesus,why is he dressed like that?
[2:42:42] <tierney12> #FREESTRATOS
[2:42:49] <Malziel> @Laecerelius Yo you on PC?
[2:42:50] <SunsetJack> Attack speed influence melee finishers speed also so...
[2:42:53] <GurrenPrime> captainthunderwolf i play super heavy samurai and im still waiting for a fucking card
[2:42:56] <Laecerelius> yeah
[2:42:57] <%captainthunderwolf> Apparently Neo-Spacians were always trash, which sucks because I really liked Yugioh GX.
[2:43:02] <GurrenPrime> yeah they suck
[2:43:05] <Malziel> @Laecerelius Same name as on twitch?
[2:43:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat go see mining guy too for a laser
[2:43:16] <GurrenPrime> all of the show elemental heroes are trash in meta
[2:43:17] <Laecerelius> yup
[2:43:18] <%captainthunderwolf> @GurrenPrime Apparently the new Frog support is garbage, so enjoy their pain at least.

[2:43:48] <Laecerelius> oh, cool. thanks
[2:43:51] <%HRDSalami654> Keep in mind also that this is pre-guilding stats. The stats will be better after you guild it.
[2:43:54] <GurrenPrime> god damn im so fucking confused
[2:44:00] <+Templar15> There's a calculator online if you want it
[2:44:04] <elementofloyalty> THIS IS THE GAME?
[2:44:04] <Zombrocom> PAT THERE IS A WEBSITE THE SOLVES YOUR PROBLEM
[2:44:06] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat got to the actual browse good, look at the blueprints and it tells you what they boost and debuff, just sans numbers
[2:44:07] <Brozime> @AngriestPat I can link you to a spreadsheet for that that lets you build it and also shows gilding
[2:44:09] <HealingMind> @AngriestPat there's a Zaw building website that shows you the stats for each parts
[2:44:09] <+ruddyredbone> look at the descriptions
[2:44:09] <MajorCrasher> Everything about zaws is awful
[2:44:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you do, you see each grip's changes without varying anything else
[2:44:18] <+Clemchower> there must be a link with spread sheet explaining. i just don't know what is the link
[2:44:21] <miracleman6> LUL
[2:44:22] <%LocoCrazy_> Look at the blueprints. It tells you there.
[2:44:22] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat It says what they all do on the screen for purchasing the parts

[2:44:40] <GurrenPrime> the most unintuitive system i think ive ever seen
[2:44:41] <Malziel> I doubt we can post links, but there's a great zaw calculator that tells you the stats
[2:44:45] <DraxTD> .... did we stop warframe?
[2:44:46] <MMetas> ekwana, jai, ruhang and vargeet at the things on the weapon itself the number is how many ar eon there

[2:45:06] <%LocoCrazy_> The blueprints tell you stuff like "increases speed at the cost of status chance" etc.
[2:45:07] <%HRDSalami654> The link shows you the numbers, the handle and strike are just the link.
[2:45:07] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Just use the Wiki
[2:45:07] <GurrenPrime> what is required to even build this shit

[2:45:08] <Zbljuv> learn the lore bitch
[2:45:09] <elementofloyalty> SPEAK ENGLISH NOT KLINGON
[2:45:09] <+ruddyredbone> they are all parts
[2:45:10] <MajorCrasher> this is why you just farm forma and cetus wisps from this event LUL
[2:45:10] <%electrokev007> yes, scream more Plague
[2:45:14] <GurrenPrime> before i even decide to jump into this system
[2:45:14] <+FalconFlavoredPunch> as a lowly Rank 2 player, wtf even is this
[2:45:15] <sunny935> @AngriestPat just look up the zaw building site, it lists their names and what stats are changed
[2:45:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> But you do, you vary one type to see individual changes
[2:45:22] <+zork990> its not that bad after a bit though
[2:45:22] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat there's a website to check what exactly the parts do, makes it way easier
[2:45:23] <elementofloyalty> "Plague of Gripes"
[2:45:24] <+AcidicHorizon> !uptime
[2:45:25] <Zbljuv> YOU CANT SEE IT IN ISOLATION BECAUSE IT CHANGES
[2:45:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 45m 34s.
[2:45:26] <+GamesWithGreg> Okay, two things:
[2:45:26] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat There is an online calculator that will make this infinitly easier on you
[2:45:31] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Those also are not final stats! You have to gild the Zaw!
[2:45:32] <NKLhaxor> KRONSH
[2:45:35] <+Templar15> the links are + one stat - another
[2:45:39] <+GamesWithGreg> Actually, just one
[2:45:46] <elementofloyalty> @drink_plenty_of_fluids
[2:45:46] <+ajcritfumble> theres a zaw builder site that does exactly wjat you want, its dumb its not in game but it exists
[2:45:49] <%TaifuDragon> Just check the purchasing page, it says all that
[2:45:53] <%ApexWalrus> So I shouldn't get into Warframe?
[2:45:53] <Malziel> @Zbljuv you can see the stats just fine on the zaw calc website, there's no reason it should be so idiotic in-game
[2:45:54] <wak8299> @angriestpat theres a website that lets you build em, II jai does +14 status -8 crit
[2:45:54] <Scyllas> How Pat has so much plat?
[2:45:56] <+GamesWithGreg> Is this really Warframe? I haven't touched it in years and..wow this looks vastly different
[2:45:57] <%captainthunderwolf> @Brozime I just had a profound moment of genuinely thinking you were speaking a different language.
[2:46:04] <elementofloyalty> @hydrobot
[2:46:06] <+ruddyredbone> they arent great
[2:46:09] <tierney12> @Scyllas because he's a content creator
[2:46:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat go get a mining laser
[2:46:10] <GurrenPrime> does this need a specific currency or item to make?
[2:46:10] <Malziel> @ApexWalrus Warframe is great, but getting into it can be a chore.
[2:46:11] <Brozime> @captainthunderwolf that's about right
[2:46:21] <+GamesWithGreg> Holy shit, wow, this is Warframe.
[2:46:21] <%Solidnick18> Jebaited
[2:46:23] <elementofloyalty> YEA YEA YEA
[2:46:25] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat If you go like you are purchasing a zaw part blueprint from Hok, the Description will tell you about the stat changes
[2:46:26] <elementofloyalty> :D
[2:46:27] <Brozime> I'd really like to make sure he knows those aren't even final stats he's being shown
[2:46:31] <Sunstalker> @Scyllas he bought it. But it's okay. He convinced himself it was absically free.
[2:46:32] <stigna1> Early lunch for Plague!
[2:46:33] <Brozime> because it will make him very angry
[2:46:33] <+GamesWithGreg> And now I suddenly remembered they hyped up a huge update that gave the game an open world
[2:46:35] <diiizle> now this is the real Warframe
[2:46:39] <elementofloyalty> PJSalt
[2:46:45] <%Remery_> Really? :(
[2:46:46] <+Cobra743> just buy 5 of everything Pat
[2:46:48] <junipxr> @Brozime i don't think he really understands weapon stats quite yet
[2:46:50] <tierney12> @Brozime honestly i'd just tell him the optimum build
[2:46:51] <gunsrlove> @Brozime He's confused enough , and not even at AMPs yet
[2:46:51] <Scyllas> Thanks.
[2:46:51] <GurrenPrime> holy fuck this is gibberish
[2:46:57] <%captainthunderwolf> @Brozime That's the correct reason to want Pat to know things.
[2:47:00] <elementofloyalty> KeyWHORE
[2:47:04] <DisGuyOvahEre> impact is best damage; prove me wrong
[2:47:07] <DigiYggdrasil> @angriestpat when purchasing the blueprints for each part it gives you a general description of what each piece will do
[2:47:11] <%commanderclaw> This is some nonsense gibberish
[2:47:11] <@Velyndra> @Brozime hes a bit slow, needs some time to understand it
[2:47:13] <MMetas> @AngriestPat Vergeet, Ekwana, Jai and Ruhang are individual "charms" on the blade that add weight/damage and critical/status depending on how many of each are on the set of "charms"
[2:47:14] <+Templar15> the handles don't matter as much as the strikes
[2:47:16] <iusetheinternet> atleast this isn't omikron levels of stupid name conventions
[2:47:18] <+zork990> get ether daggers though
[2:47:18] <elementofloyalty> fuck these tittles
[2:47:19] <Kratok> Plague you fool

[2:47:50] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat I can send you a Zaw Spreadsheet and Zaw Calculator links if you like
[2:47:50] <%captainthunderwolf> I think it might be on your end, tierney.

[2:48:34] <+MarshallLee67> i feel like plague is trying to confuse pat lmao
[2:48:39] <elementofloyalty> *Pat rolls eyes*
[2:48:40] <Zombrocom> Can I post a link to the zaw builder website? It solves all of pats problems
[2:48:40] <stigna1> Maaaybe he does not need all this frontloaded info?
[2:48:42] <+BoSteed> Not even it's final form
[2:48:45] <%captainthunderwolf> Depending upon how nuanced your understanding of weapons is, the handle of a weapon meaning less than its handle and grip is either obvious or profoundly incorrect.
[2:48:46] <Ahk_90> My god this is a solid wall of "I can't understand wtf is going on"
[2:48:49] <Malziel> @MarshallLee67 Nope! It's all legit shit. This is how ridiculous it can get. zimeLUL
[2:48:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Oh yeah, building amps works the same way

[2:49:56] <elementofloyalty> he is
[2:49:56] <+d00msdaydan> plague kind of explains everything in a super roundabout way
[2:50:00] <HypeArbalest> Hes doing the best he can actually
[2:50:03] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat There is a zaw calculator website that will make this way easier
[2:50:04] <elementofloyalty> Plague
[2:50:06] <NemokillerV> He has gotten an amp after spoiler quest 2
[2:50:06] <%dantegus> Just look at the wiki
[2:50:09] <+MarshallLee67> plague is mostly correct but the way he's explaining this is super fucking confusing lmao
[2:50:09] <elementofloyalty> NO
[2:50:10] <IminyourBase> patgitated
[2:50:11] <Shinmaddrox> I'm understanding it.
[2:50:16] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat I whispered a Zaw Calculator and Zaw Spreadsheet to you, so you can take your time and look it over at your own pace
[2:50:17] <%TaifuDragon> He's correct in the most useless way
[2:50:20] <+ruddyredbone> the time doenst matter besides the bp

[2:50:25] <stigna1> @AngriestPat You're super fine for right now, you have enough copies. 2 is really all you need.
[2:50:26] <DoubledOgre> I haven't made a zaw and I'm understanding plague
[2:50:26] <+fireking900> @MajorCrasher damnit major you beat me to it
[2:50:34] <+Clemchower> i would say also get exodia each 10
[2:50:35] <MajorCrasher> hehehe
[2:50:37] <elementofloyalty> "Go to the Zalw guy and ruin the stream".
[2:50:42] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Just get the parts now and then you have infinite time to figure it out
[2:50:43] <+Ciphris> JUST GET THE PLAGUE PARTS AND WORRY ABOUT IT LATER
[2:50:43] <wak8299> @angriestpat there is a website where you can make zaws and they show you the full stats
[2:50:45] <RazielTheDark> Look, just get 5 of the strike and figure it out later
[2:50:52] <+Clemchower> just gotta stock blue prints atm
[2:50:53] <+Spenzor> get 10 of each exodia, both are good/fun
[2:50:58] <+AvoineRa1n> is a nerf gun a zaw?
[2:51:01] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat Look, just buy the blueprints for now then look at the calculator later
[2:51:01] <Zepik> would it be easier for him to make a shitty zaw with more common parts just as a tutorial?
[2:51:02] <elementofloyalty> HEY ITS FUN SIZE PEACH
[2:51:04] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat You do have plenty of time, just buy the 5 blueprints and then plan how to build the Zaw later
[2:51:14] <GodlyLuigi> hehe
[2:51:15] <GurrenPrime> why did they make it so obtuse
[2:51:17] <%LocoCrazy_> I meant the Zaws in general. They're overwhelming at first but you're a smart guy, Pat. Just take your time when you're not streaming and being yelled at.
[2:51:19] <DantesAnimus> WOW that lil accent pop for Plague... "Lyin round" ><

[2:53:34] <Heart0fInk> Titania is pretty good. she can just zip and fly around the map
[2:53:36] <+jestrfestr> yeah you do have Titania, she can fly
[2:53:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> hey guys in squad, set down an archwing for Pat
[2:53:39] <+unfoldingchoas> @fadingember gift off
[2:53:41] <drakthebest> @AngriestPat USE TITANIA SHE CAN FLY
[2:53:42] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Does pat even HAVE Titania
[2:53:44] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat boy i can't wait until you get to hunting eidolons
[2:53:45] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat there is a zaw calculator website that would make this way easier on you. just google Warframe Zaw Calculator
[2:53:48] <+TheGodfrey> HE does
[2:53:49] <Aleate> These missions take me forever because people keep making the darn Lephantis too strong BibleThump
[2:53:51] <%TaifuDragon> Titania's flight is slow as shit
[2:53:53] <FadingEmber> welp
[2:53:55] <+Clemchower> actually, if you remove limited time factor, you can just chill in the plague missions. there is no time limit for the last phase.
[2:53:55] <+ruddyredbone> @FadingEmber he has them, just not the launcher
[2:53:57] <+mikesniderman> just invite Brozime into your party
[2:53:59] <elementofloyalty> AWWWW Baby gripes
[2:54:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat have somebody in squad (Plague) set down an Archwing for you
[2:54:25] <+jestrfestr> she can fly for as long as you have energy which is why you mod for that
[2:54:26] <@Mechz71> Cause she MELTs the hemos
[2:54:37] <+FlacidPaenus> zephyr and excal pretty fast
[2:54:38] <+ruddyredbone> BabyRage
[2:54:38] <IminyourBase> titania does a shit ton of dmg, don't listen to plague. if you build your primary right you melt that boss
[2:54:42] <DraxTD> @elementofloyalty Gripes babies! *to the tune of muppet babbies*
[2:54:49] <7o8145> Is this chains of harrow stream?
[2:54:51] <elementofloyalty> MAGGOTS
[2:54:57] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Glad I have a Zephyr, though, god dang I need to get her prime
[2:55:03] <TropicalPsychosis> pat what the fuck
[2:55:10] <NemokillerV> @7o8145 No, this is a plague star grind stream
[2:55:12] <+NickyDynamite> The time limit is only getting things, it doesn't matter
[2:55:17] <+Clemchower> worst case, get something non tradable first.
[2:55:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> It takes like 5 hours, you just refuse to use anything ut Rhino @AngriestPat
[2:55:20] <+ruddyredbone> you only need 2 bp really
[2:55:22] <+Shadowthedigger> Pat, take a chill, they told you exactly what to get.
[2:55:24] <Zbljuv> you do
[2:55:26] <TropicalPsychosis> just buy a bag of those gross flesh parts and figure it out later
[2:55:28] <stigna1> @AngriestPat You have already acquired enough of the stuff you need. Its cool.
[2:55:29] <Zbljuv> you have 2
[2:55:29] <Shinmaddrox> You already have half the blades
[2:55:30] <Volkrotia> Exxcept it isnt limited AT ALL cause you CAN build Zaws whenever u want, you just havent yet
[2:55:31] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat It's really not that complicated. Just get get the pieces and figure it out later
[2:55:32] <+Clemchower> should be achievable in some dozen runs
[2:55:34] <Kratok> @AngriestPat you're fine! You bought Zaw parts you need, everything on that part is buffers now
[2:55:35] <Zbljuv> and you said oyu need 5
[2:55:38] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat buy 5 of each while the event is up THATS ALL YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AS FAR AS TIME LIMITS
[2:55:46] <Sloavon> is Plague here just because his name is in the event?
[2:55:48] <drakthebest> You could also use Volt Pat
[2:55:52] <Zepik> I'm still way at the early game so all the time limited stuff is way over my head. Ignorance is bliss
[2:55:53] <Malziel> @legendfather_of_giants Not everyone can invest 24h a day into warframe, every day my man. :/
[2:55:53] <+zork990> you dont have to get everything this time, its a recurring event
[2:55:53] <+FragmentNation> you have 2 days and 20 hours
[2:55:54] <+AntithesisEK> LUL yes perfect limbo on the plains
[2:55:54] <GurrenPrime> i love nova
[2:55:55] <IminyourBase> rhino stomp makes this go fast, don't listen to them
[2:55:55] <Worldbrand> Get a buddy to spot him the archwing launchers
[2:55:56] <drakthebest> For zoom zoom speeds
[2:55:59] <Ixiah> GET SONIC FRAME
[2:56:01] <+ruddyredbone> build the archwing launchers
[2:56:05] <TropicalPsychosis> "get a couple of these specific things"Pat: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO GET REEEEE
[2:56:06] <wak8299> rhino is super good for the boss, since you can stomp and stop him while his weakspotd are open
[2:56:07] <%Nonsubcasual> or just get archwing
[2:56:11] <%HRDSalami654> Nova is a good one, but I think he should try to get some corrupted mods first.
[2:56:11] <stigna1> Each everyone, he's already good.
[2:56:13] <FadingEmber> @AngriestPat you were gifted a flying warframe the first stream man\
[2:56:14] <GurrenPrime> launchers would be better lol
[2:56:15] <stigna1> *easy
[2:56:16] <Zbljuv> you can just build rhino for charge and speedrun that way
[2:56:16] <Brozime> @AngriestPat A party member can drop Archwing charges for you if they have extra
[2:56:20] <Shinmaddrox> @Zbljuv He needs 5 of two different blade. He has 2 of one and 3 of another.
[2:56:20] <IminyourBase> if you time your stomp right on the boss you can essentially freeze the boss
[2:56:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Malziel he has way more hours than me, he just hasn't levelled anything else
[2:56:31] <jeppeww> it's easy, just get all the naramon and zenurik waybounds :P
[2:56:33] <MajorCrasher> To be fair, building zaws and the event as a whole are purely optional. it's mainly for crazy completionists
[2:56:39] <GurrenPrime> no pat fucking titania
[2:56:40] <elementofloyalty> Plague is son of Angry Nerd
[2:56:41] <IminyourBase> someone else can call you an archwing btw
[2:56:42] <7o8145> @AngriestPat You only need one zephyr player to run the objective, the rest of the players can afk by the boil until fight time
[2:56:45] <%ApexWalrus> @AngriestPat Could you stand by the door w/ your lower level frame and get power leveled?
[2:56:46] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat why not spend the time during this mission to gather the natural resources for the launcher
[2:56:51] <Twoiis> It's fiiine.
[2:56:51] <+ruddyredbone> yeah its bad
[2:56:52] <Kratok> Titania is not that fast
[2:56:54] <Malziel> @legendfather_of_giants Which means... he doesn't have... the time... PogChamp
[2:56:58] <stigna1> Yeah, plague is super right.
[2:56:58] <IminyourBase> pat someone else can call you an archwing
[2:57:00] <+zork990> just have someone in your squad go nova
[2:57:00] <TofuNyan> @AngriestPat Is that fucking Iaido style?
[2:57:01] <+WizardofWazz> its fiiiine
[2:57:02] <diiizle> Plague is right
[2:57:08] <iusetheinternet> Titania is only good with razor wing auvment
[2:57:09] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat someone else can call you an archwing
[2:57:12] <GurrenPrime> @AngriestPat Pat titania
[2:57:17] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Yeah archwings are basically time sinks
[2:57:18] <iusetheinternet> for plains anyway
[2:57:19] <elementofloyalty> Plague wants a custom made game
[2:57:22] <$PimpDaddyPrime> To farm
[2:57:27] <Kratok> Fishing is fun
[2:57:31] <drakthebest> Learning to fish now might actually work
[2:57:36] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Try not to think of the grind as a whole.... just take it a mission at a time, do your best to learn. It is just weird timing that the event showed up when you were getting your feet wet with the game
[2:57:40] <Volkrotia> But Plague if there was a cooldown, you couldnt use it to get to a location, then spawn another.
[2:57:41] <gigiaten> I know nothing of Warframe and it's hilarious seeing chat be torn and pat being frustrated
[2:58:01] <Brozime> @AngriestPat A party member can drop Archwing charges for you if they have extra
[2:58:01] <+Clemchower> mineframe LUL
[2:58:02] <+ajcritfumble> i made a speed nezha build for plains and thats still not fast enough for speed comps
[2:58:02] <+ruddyredbone> remember when you were able to extract in the plains during the gara quest. why cant you do that again
[2:58:03] <elementofloyalty> Fishing is not fun
[2:58:10] <elementofloyalty> There's no porn
[2:58:13] <+WizardofWazz> :^)
[2:58:15] <drakthebest> I mean i'm pretty sure no one is actually watching the gameplay Pat. It's just the same loop again and again. We're listening to you talk. So fishing wouldn't really change anything
[2:58:28] <+ajcritfumble> fishing is nice
[2:58:29] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat Rhino is fine for this boss fight if you time your stomps right. and someone else can call you an archwing
[2:58:30] <%HRDSalami654> It's SO EASY Pat! geez! /s
[2:58:32] <DonatelloJose> I have no idea what’s going on and I’m incredibly stressed out.
[2:58:35] <+NickyDynamite> I think you just gotta chill and keep doing what you're doin
[2:58:35] <%electrokev007> it's ok Pat we love you <3
[2:58:35] <$BenLubar> I'm amazed how often "dig up, stupid" was good advice during paige's undertale playthrough
[2:58:42] <GurrenPrime> isnt mobility literally titanias thing?
[2:58:43] <elementofloyalty> I love Elmo
[2:58:50] <GurrenPrime> and nova has teleports
[2:58:52] <+Clemchower> under your in game progress, rhino and keep supporting team with your roar ability is the best move
[2:58:57] <Ixiah> @AngriestPat YES ITS CALLED GET VOLT FRAME
[2:59:00] <JimJamr> Have you even tried to "learn" other frames?
[2:59:00] <7o8145> Rhino is actually great for plague star, he can buff and CC the hemocyte if you're running 4x4
[2:59:00] <Twoiis> I think Rhino is fine at least he probably won't die if they ever do catalyst.
[2:59:01] <+mikesniderman> volt
[2:59:03] <Zbljuv> RHINOS CHARGE IS MOBILTY
[2:59:06] <GreatestGuess> @angriestpat volt?
[2:59:07] <Malziel> @GurrenPrime 'eh, there are a lot better mobility flames. Titania may be able to fly, but her speed isn't that high.
[2:59:09] <Worldbrand> they're also giving us vehicles
[2:59:09] <SunsetJack> Nidus is good..
[2:59:10] <wak8299> @angriestpat if you build max range rhino you can go far as shit with your one, rhino with max range is the fastest frames in the game
[2:59:12] <drakthebest> Rhino would be good if they were fighting the hemocyte but since they're not it's not particularly relevant. BTW none of the enemies actually hit hard enough to kill you outside of Rhino, unless you're fighting the hemocyte
[2:59:16] <%Thelvl1king> You are fine pat
[2:59:16] <Malziel> @Zbljuv Not if your build has low range
[2:59:17] <junipxr> Pat, are you in a clan?
[2:59:19] <GurrenPrime> the charge is pretty short range though Zbljuv
[2:59:28] <%vampireinarm> I feel like the Plains is too small but also not populated enough with landmarks
[2:59:30] <%Nonsubcasual> they are making a vehicle for venus
[2:59:34] <lab990> they showed off vehicles last dev stream
[2:59:34] <Brozime> @AngriestPat If you have the mod Mobilize it will make you significantly faster
[2:59:37] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat **IF** you want to (and you don't have to) you can use Equinox as a good farming frame **IF** you are comfortable leveling her, possibly with an affinity booster
[2:59:38] <+iGunnerz> is the venus plains gonna be snow based?
[2:59:39] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Rhino's Third ability is a party damage buff btw...
[2:59:42] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat someone else can call you an archwing and time your stomps on the boss to freeze it
[2:59:43] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:45] <+ruddyredbone> all they need to do is have an extract option
[2:59:46] <Volkrotia> Is it really that much to ask to press ONE button to enable the 'move fast' option?
[2:59:47] <+jestrfestr> DE got a huge player base bump from plains so they have an "open spaces" hard on now
[2:59:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat one of your squad can set down an archwing for you
[2:59:56] <+ruddyredbone> they void dashing
[2:59:57] <Zbljuv> build for range nerd
[2:59:59] <+ruddyredbone> try
[3:00:00] <Volkrotia> Also each fish gives u like 10 fish oil its so easy
[3:00:02] <Ixiah> wtf Bot
[3:00:07] <GurrenPrime> oh yeah cant he void dash?
[3:00:10] <stigna1> Ok, well they have a speedy guy on the squad who can trigger timers whilst Pat catches up. Meaning the speed of the run is determined by the FASTEST person in the squad, not the slowest. Pat's Rhino is TOTALLY FINE.
[3:00:12] <Brozime> @AngriestPat I can give you one it's a common I have thousands of
[3:00:13] <drakthebest> Pat could use his infinite money to buy zephyr
[3:00:14] <Zbljuv> charge is really spamable
[3:00:15] <+Clemchower> you can also support your tema with ability 3 Pat. better than nothing. assuming you are only rhino in the squad
[3:00:24] <GurrenPrime> lol brozime get in there
[3:00:25] <Zbljuv> you can combo it with void dash
[3:00:26] <SolidChozo> Did you see the latest dev stream @plagueofgripes
[3:00:26] <drakthebest> It would actually be super easy for Pat to use his infinite money to buy zephyr
[3:00:29] <elementofloyalty> NJ Devils sucks
[3:00:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Pat, you have way more hours than me, just use other frames unless you NEED Rhino to survive
[3:00:35] <+FlacidPaenus> why doesnt pat use warframe market he got 5k plat
[3:00:39] <Twoiis> This is very cute.
[3:00:44] <junipxr> i feel like pat should just be working on star chart stuff and ranking MR rather than doing this event that primarily involves veteran mechanics and stuff...
[3:00:50] <+NickyDynamite> It's fine
[3:00:57] <junipxr> quests too
[3:01:00] <vaan_ratsbane> ive only been on the plains once when it came out, it was so boring I havent come back since
[3:01:00] <elementofloyalty> Woolie?
[3:01:06] <drakthebest> @AngriestPat You could buy pre-built Zephyr with your massive store of plat if you want to run it faster
[3:01:08] <%HRDSalami654> Pat is doing fine, but the problem is that this even is going on and it's super time limited.
[3:01:13] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat time your rhino stomps to freeze the boss, and people can call you an archwing
[3:01:21] <TheSpartanThief> Same with me...and the planets were different in rotation
[3:01:37] <%HRDSalami654> He needs more things, but he doesn't have the option to get those things before the event is over.
[3:01:42] <+fireking900> same for me i have jupiter unlocked but im suoer low lvl
[3:01:42] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Mobilize is really common so you might have one and not know it or somebody can just give you one
[3:01:43] <xanerts> Videogames were a mistake
[3:01:49] <zakti_prime> does plague not have any archwing charges he could call for pat?
[3:01:52] <+Clemchower> IMO, to give proper advice or help, you gotta try from beginning with updated game too.
[3:02:04] <+ruddyredbone> this event will probably come back
[3:02:06] <ThalesMeh> Relax, Pat. Just get 1 copy of each handles (They aren't very good), get 2-5 copies of the strikes (Viral is OP) and forget about arcanes (Hard as fuck to build).
[3:02:06] <IminyourBase> plague probably does which is why i'm trying to tell him
[3:02:07] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Pat, have you considered just buying the resources with Plat? Kappa
[3:02:19] <IminyourBase> and rhino is dope for this fight. his roar and stomp help a lot
[3:02:22] <7o8145> I kind of get that, one of the reasons I enjoy watching Pat play is to get a taste of the new player experience, because I haven't experienced that in 5 years, but that guy sounds like an asshole
[3:02:26] <Twoiis> They had Plague Star back in december, I wouldn't worry too much about it not coming back.
[3:02:28] <GurrenPrime> when i started playing warframe 4 years ago, there werent even events
[3:02:31] <+Yuvandon> Khora looks fairly lackluster
[3:02:34] <+Clemchower> Also, arcanes are tradable. worst case, you can get it later too via other players
[3:02:34] <tierney12> so who doesn't have the supra vandal? Kappa
[3:02:38] <GurrenPrime> so all of this shit is confusing to me
[3:02:39] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Man, I can't wait for Plague Star to come to consoleframe
[3:02:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat have someone else in squad set down an Archwing for you and it'll be faster
[3:02:54] <+valkuma> Its because they have to tailor the content to people who have been playing for 5 years
[3:03:00] <$PimpDaddyPrime> I'm going to scream at so many people who keep me from farming Plague Star
[3:03:01] <elementofloyalty> Zolft helps WF game play
[3:03:01] <drakthebest> And it's like "I could get these things that let me do it better but then I wouldn't be doing the time liimited thing"
[3:03:10] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat don't worry, this is probably the only time this will ever happen to you
[3:03:12] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat the only time-limited part of this situation is GETTING the zaw parts, then you can USE the at your leisure
[3:03:12] <Kratok> People were EXCITED for this???
[3:03:15] <Derkinstacker> Pat, you're over thinking it. With or without that zaw you can still be a god emperor.
[3:03:17] <+ajcritfumble> the one 2 week span that i cant play the game is of course the time plaguestar comes back :( guess im waiting another half a year for the zaw stuff
[3:03:17] <%HRDSalami654> I don't know why, Plague Star is dumb.
[3:03:22] <Volkrotia> Zaws are not a time limited feature though. You COULD know about them but havent yet, therefore tyoure confused
[3:03:23] <EASrake> people want forma
[3:03:24] <kenpachi9211> the break up starts now
[3:03:24] <+unfoldingchoas> It all good, just get the 5 and after this even,t workk on more frames, and syndicate. The event will come back again, it just take time.
[3:03:27] <%HRDSalami654> It's one of the worst events.
[3:03:30] <elementofloyalty> NO GOAL
[3:03:36] <GurrenPrime> i didnt even look into the event, i need formas
[3:03:38] <MajorCrasher> Plague Star is hyped because people want to farm forma and cetus wisps
[3:03:43] <GurrenPrime> but this is too much of a cluster fuck for me to figure out
[3:03:44] <+ruddyredbone> its the only way to farm wisps
[3:03:50] <Malziel> @HRDSalami654 Like plague said. it's the rewards that are the reason. Actually doing the event is rough if you aren't doing the super min/max bullshit
[3:03:51] <+zork990> @AngriestPat have someone else in your squad go nova
[3:03:56] <7o8145> @AngriestPat get plague to give you mobilize and other -friction mods, they're just normal mods it's not like cheating or anythjing to get them now
[3:03:56] <+MarshallLee67> the damage cap on hemocyte is so dumb- only ran plague star 6 times then stopped this time around
[3:04:00] <Malziel> @ruddyredbone You can farm wisps at night just fine
[3:04:02] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Ok, so @AngriestPat the way they fix this is allow you to build an AI frame like Injustice 2 so you don't need to play it yourself anymore
[3:04:03] <+mikesniderman> pat you are overthinking this. just have fun
[3:04:06] <%commanderclaw> Just chill man, don't worry about it
[3:04:12] <+jestrfestr> exilus mod
[3:04:17] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Warframe mod
[3:04:19] <TheSpartanThief> It's not that good, and yet people just WOULDN'T shut up about wanting it back. And then COMPLAINED when they brought it back!
[3:04:19] <drakthebest> It's a mod that makes you slide faster
[3:04:19] <Derkinstacker> Speed increase
[3:04:19] <+jestrfestr> makes your bullet jumo farther
[3:04:20] <+unfoldingchoas> warframe mod
[3:04:20] <tierney12> warframe mod
[3:04:22] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat use rhino stomp to freeze the boss and roar to up your dmg. let plague call you an archwing
[3:04:22] <Imperium78> It's fiiiiiiine pat
[3:04:23] <sunny935> wasnt excited for this only got bokwin and kreipath and that all im doing, than again i did it the first time it came out
[3:04:23] <UvBenServed> Warframe mod. Better bullet jumps
[3:04:25] <SunsetJack> warframe mod
[3:04:29] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Maybe they should run events for month long with only needing 4 days of gameplay to get what you need so people only need to play day a weekend. IDK, events seem rough even a few years back.
[3:04:29] <%HRDSalami654> I understand that it's the rewards, but the even should be fun if you are going to ask people to run it multiple times.
[3:04:31] <+Jylakir> I think you're do to muich pressure to your self, you just need the zaw blueprints and hunters amuniton from this event :)
[3:04:31] <SunsetJack> Increase bullet jump speed I think?
[3:04:32] <sunny935> its a movement exilus mod
[3:04:35] <+ruddyredbone> @Malziel one per outing is very slow compared to 3 with the plague star
[3:04:43] <InsomniacPersona> can also take rush
[3:04:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat YOU DOO
[3:04:46] <+Typhaeon> It's right there!
[3:04:47] <junipxr> CRAZY TALK
[3:04:47] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat mobilize makes your bullet jump better
[3:04:47] <tierney12> YES YOU DP
[3:04:47] <+MarshallLee67> PAT YOU DO
[3:04:47] <ThalesMeh> Mobilize is AMAZING. I LOVE IT
[3:04:48] <DroppingDead> wat
[3:04:48] <+zork990> its right there
[3:04:48] <Derkinstacker> Rush
[3:04:49] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat YOU HAVE IT
[3:04:51] <Zenduviq> For real...?
[3:04:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> ITS RIGHT THERE
[3:04:52] <PhantaniumOG> BLIND
[3:04:52] <+jestrfestr> it makes you bullet jump further its good
[3:04:53] <tierney12> IT'S RIGHT THERE

[3:05:30] <MajorCrasher> lvl it
[3:05:30] <%HRDSalami654> Level it up Pat.
[3:05:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> its not upgraded @AngriestPat
[3:05:31] <Malziel> Bullet Jump bonuses are *real* nice
[3:05:31] <elementofloyalty> @BuriasDempsey :D
[3:05:32] <ThalesMeh> hmmm
[3:05:32] <+unfoldingchoas> level it
[3:05:33] <Malziel> even at lower levels
[3:05:34] <$PimpDaddyPrime> you have FOUR of them XD
[3:05:37] <Brozime> @AngriestPat the boost is much larger than it looks
[3:05:38] <%ApexWalrus> I love you Pat lol
[3:05:38] <zakti_prime> does pat have actual need for glasses or is he just short attention
[3:05:42] <DantesAnimus> the blindness part of Crazy Talk should be called Snake Eyes.
[3:05:42] <elementofloyalty> FLOAT GOODER
[3:05:44] <deviate_dv8> upgrade it
[3:05:44] <SunsetJack> When you level it, it will increase to 30% I think.
[3:05:49] <+Clemchower> oh it's not formad rhino.
[3:05:49] <dsauce999> DIG UP STUPID!
[3:05:52] <drakthebest> There's a mod that reduces friction see if you have that one as well?
[3:05:55] <+AntithesisEK> mobility mods are extremely valuable once you really get used to it
[3:05:57] <MajorCrasher> Rush is bad
[3:05:59] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat A lot of these events WILL roll around again. try not to feel daunted because the events time limited nature... It's just unfortunate timing that it is happening now when you are still new
[3:06:13] <elementofloyalty> 'TOM SAWYER*
[3:06:14] <nyseoul85> !uptime
[3:06:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 6m 23s.
[3:06:15] <7o8145> Rush is great on speed volt
[3:06:16] <Malziel> 20% is more than you think. zimeLUL
[3:06:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> it actually is tho
[3:06:17] <%captainthunderwolf> 20% is actually meaningful.
[3:06:20] <%Nonsubcasual> some guy on reddit maxed all mods some months ago
[3:06:21] <+timtheinchanter> NUMBERS NOT BIG ENOUGH
[3:06:24] <sirsirejay> God i hate farming endo
[3:06:24] <Derkinstacker> Why is he so mad?
[3:06:24] <%captainthunderwolf> That's enough to feel.
[3:06:24] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat let plague call you an archwing
[3:06:26] <+ruddyredbone> try void dashing pat
[3:06:26] <FadingEmber> Salty Pat is best Pat
[3:06:26] <%HRDSalami654> You would be surprised.
[3:06:29] <Eyesofthewolf> couldnt a teammate swap to volt and have him use the speed boost ability ?
[3:06:32] <SolidChozo> THE NUMBERS ARE TOO WEAK
[3:06:34] <+Spenzor> 20% is really noticeable
[3:06:36] <Volkrotia> Oh wow a 20% movement buff WOOOWWWW
[3:06:38] <%HRDSalami654> Pat needs some applesauce.
[3:06:38] <MajorCrasher> It's actually a huge boost
[3:06:40] <Volkrotia> IT actually very fast
[3:06:45] <+AntithesisEK> yeah but what's 20% of vroooom
[3:06:45] <diiizle> 20% is really high though....
[3:06:47] <Zenduviq> I'm surprised someone like Pat doesn't think 20% is a lot.
[3:06:47] <%captainthunderwolf> Pat has actually gone on diatribes about how important 20% is for a stat in an MMO setting.
[3:06:48] <DroppingDead> may be 20%, but pat how many times do you bullet jump?
[3:06:51] <sunny935> have shit ton of sculptures i could turn in, but they are just there in my inventory
[3:06:53] <%Remery_> 20% is alot tho
[3:06:53] <elementofloyalty> Woolie has chemical reactions,not emotions
[3:06:59] <+Ryo_no_Kage> Vicarious Embarrassment
[3:06:59] <junipxr> sadist plague LUL
[3:07:03] <%Solidnick18> apatElmo
[3:07:03] <Derkinstacker> pat would kill a baby for a 1% increase on anything.
[3:07:05] <Thesaltymixture> Gotta. Go. Fast. Trust in Brozime
[3:07:06] <Volkrotia> If u bullet jump every second youre saving 20 seconds from every minute
[3:07:07] <Aussie_Manny> Plague, NOOOOOOOOOOO!
[3:07:13] <elementofloyalty> KILL THE FAWN
[3:07:13] <+Clemchower> Pat, but don't worry too much. to make all in a short sentence, you just need to get limited items only. others are all achievable using platinum or via trade.
[3:07:14] <SweetCheeksTrap> Schoudenfroid
[3:07:16] <+jestrfestr> everyone does, we can have bunny ears forever though
[3:07:17] <+Alter_Faust> yup it kinda sucks
[3:07:19] <+Wukku> cheer500 Pat, you are doing great! Do the game at your own pace, everything comes back eventually.
[3:07:20] <%HRDSalami654> You're almost there Pat.
[3:07:20] <+jestrfestr> cant*
[3:07:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[3:07:24] <%Thelvl1king> Pat don’t get discouraged cause someone was being rude.
[3:07:25] <+ruddyredbone> why 5?
[3:07:26] <Zbljuv> spend more time playing games
[3:07:29] <Aussie_Manny> Is that a blueprint for The Baby?
[3:07:34] <NemokillerV> just do it 4 more times and you'll be fine
[3:07:37] <zakti_prime> he doesn't need that many
[3:07:38] <elementofloyalty> 5 5 5 5 5
[3:07:45] <fabnanman> time limited events is one of the main reasons i pretty much quit mmos
[3:07:45] <+Alter_Faust> now while your there get whips
[3:07:50] <+TheGodfrey> now get 10 exoidas
[3:07:51] <7o8145> You aren't gonna need 5, I was done after 2
[3:07:55] <%HRDSalami654> Just do you, Pat.
[3:07:59] <Zbljuv> brozime trolled you and left chat
[3:07:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat not worth it
[3:08:05] <Malziel> @7o8145 Depends on how hard you wanna go on Zaws
[3:08:05] <%HRDSalami654> Don't worry about that shit.
[3:08:06] <%Nonsubcasual> they are not important
[3:08:07] <Brozime> @Zbljuv no
[3:08:13] <Zbljuv> shhh
[3:08:14] <ThalesMeh> NO
[3:08:15] <junipxr> it is going to take pat WEEKS before he gets enough rep to gild something guys, relax
[3:08:15] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Just try not to think of the time limit, events like this usually last a few weeks
[3:08:16] <%HRDSalami654> At you're level don't worry about it.
[3:08:18] <+gozzojt27> dont worry about those
[3:08:19] <+ruddyredbone> thank god they changed them
[3:08:24] <Volkrotia> DO NOT worry about that
[3:08:25] <+forebringer> @Zbljuv Incorrect
[3:08:25] <Zbljuv> you dont need 10 1 is enough
[3:08:27] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat you should also get the Snipetron blueprint- it's the only place you can get that sniper
[3:08:27] <%captainthunderwolf> Exodia is dead in the meta, not enough searches and the modern format has a ton of hand destruction.
[3:08:27] <sunny935> the arcanes only work on the zaws btw
[3:08:27] <+Clemchower> the gun Snipetron is also limited to this event. if you are interested in maxing MR in game
[3:08:28] <MajorCrasher> Exodias are not important, the event will come back eventually
[3:08:29] <TheSpartanThief> I only have a couple that I'm saving till Plague Star is done....to sell.
[3:08:35] <%captainthunderwolf> And Exodia Necross has always been a joke.
[3:08:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Admiral_PopnFresh 1 of each is more than enough
[3:08:38] <elementofloyalty> Wow,Gripes is sicken by Pat
[3:08:39] <%ApexWalrus> @AngriestPat Don't forget 30 Flextablets
[3:08:42] <ThalesMeh> Arcanes are so hard to build
[3:08:44] <+Clemchower> exodia is tradable. no worries Pat.
[3:08:55] <7o8145> @Malziel I have a hard time believing anyone is going to make, gild, catalyst, and/or forma more then 1 or 2 dirfferent kripath zaws
[3:08:55] <+Basilias_Maximus> It's odd to hear Plague be consoling.
[3:08:58] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat you're legit doing well, it's just the anxiety of time constraints takes its toll
[3:09:02] <diiizle> Take a deep breath Pat. It's really not bad at all, you have more than enough time to get everything important easy
[3:09:02] <zakti_prime> I think the problem is pat is being pushed to get high level gear ir high level content when he's still very beginner
[3:09:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> but that's so much faster
[3:09:07] <MajorCrasher> You're way faster
[3:09:12] <+ajcritfumble> over 300 hours still not touched arcanes
[3:09:12] <Brozime> @AngriestPat you honestly have no chance of getting those arcanes built and they won't do much for you so don't worry about those
[3:09:13] <%Thelvl1king> @angriestpat it’s like asking why you don’t have the best gear in mon hun day 1 hour 1 don’t worry about it just take your time now.
[3:09:13] <tierney12> exodia decks in 2018 Kappa
[3:09:14] <Imperium78> Way waaaaay faster
[3:09:15] <levitheshark> No, you are noticeably faster
[3:09:15] <elementofloyalty> Gotta go faster
[3:09:24] <Volkrotia> You are VERY faster
[3:09:27] <ThalesMeh> You're much faster dude
[3:09:29] <%Remery_> Fast enough to be noticeable
[3:09:31] <$PimpDaddyPrime> AN EXTRA 0.5 FEET PER MINUTE
[3:09:33] <Shaikan_ITA> Wow, I never used mobilize but this is actually noticeable
[3:09:36] <Shooterboy23> I dunno why they added cars to this
[3:09:40] <Imperium78> Because you are an asshole
[3:09:40] <Shaikan_ITA> Gonna use it now
[3:09:41] <Zbljuv> i thought it was zafir plague
[3:09:42] <FadingEmber> because of the salt
[3:09:43] <+NickyDynamite> I think most of this stuff doesn't actually matter. It's not stuff to get stressed about missing. The arcanes at least
[3:09:44] <Derkinstacker> Because your being a salty bitch Pat!
[3:09:47] <cgmerryo> Because you're acting like a fuckin baby.\
[3:09:47] <+Alter_Faust> to be honest you are a lot faster
[3:09:48] <dsauce999> I have never played warframe but i can see the increase in speed
[3:09:53] <+ajcritfumble> pat real talk its noticably faster my guy
[3:09:53] <%MisterCrimson> to be fair, it's really hard to judge speed increases in large open environments. In the corridors, it's way more obvious
[3:09:54] <zakti_prime> he is a ton faster
[3:09:54] <$Bane_Kaikyo> YOU ARE VERY FASTER NOW YOU BIG DUMB ANGEREY BOI!! @AngriestPat
[3:09:57] <+valkuma> thats pretty fast, thats like a volt buff
[3:10:01] <Malziel> @cgmerryo Motherfucker have you *played* this game? zimeLUL
[3:10:01] <anar_bael> What did pat need to finish vauban cause the chassie is a reward now
[3:10:02] <elementofloyalty> Who's the Maggot guy?
[3:10:16] <cgmerryo> Yes I'm pretty far into it.
[3:10:18] <+ruddyredbone> now that arcanes drop from the teralists I can finally use them
[3:10:21] <+gutlesscoward> @AngriestPat just bug plague to make him drop AW launchers for you
[3:10:21] <%HRDSalami654> Rhino is the sronkest.
[3:10:22] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> I really enjoy Frost Prime
[3:10:24] <%vampireinarm> @AngriestPat you should mellee downwards when falling down like that to just rocket downwards
[3:10:27] <sirsirejay> Mesa best frame
[3:10:29] <+Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat If you still need the chassis, Vau baun chassis is up atm.
[3:10:31] <Malziel> @cgmerryo Then you should know how fucking complicated this shit can get. zimeLUL
[3:10:34] <zakti_prime> @anar_bael he needs neuroptics
[3:10:40] <anar_bael> Ah
[3:10:41] <%Remery_> Rhino best waifu?
[3:10:43] <drakthebest> There is no frame in the game stronger than rhino, he's kind of spoiled you on all other frames
[3:10:44] <Zbljuv> rhino is objectively best frame
[3:10:58] <%HRDSalami654> Say hello to Warframe events.
[3:10:59] <SunsetJack> Honestly, I stop playing favorite frame and pick frames for their utility.
[3:11:12] <+Robopengy> @angriestpat Hey Pat, I got the rhino. What do I do now?
[3:11:13] <+fireking900> it will
[3:11:13] <+decisivelynameless> People saying it won't ever return are idiots.
[3:11:14] <Derkinstacker> Pat, play Volt then
[3:11:14] <DaFrankTank> welcome to free to play
[3:11:14] <+valkuma> plague star has been around for long enough.. isnt it thek ind of thing you can get everything you want out of in a day?
[3:11:18] <Derkinstacker> FOR SPEED MAN
[3:11:20] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you dont have to
[3:11:22] <MajorCrasher> Because of the way frames work you kinda have to read the wiki or look up builds to know how they actually work
[3:11:25] <+decisivelynameless> I've seen it twice in the time I've been playing
[3:11:28] <%LocoCrazy_> Pat... I will return. Just like the Stalker acolytes.
[3:11:28] <+fireking900> it will take awhile but it will come back
[3:11:33] <Kratok> @AngriestPat for some reason, one of the rewards of getting stronger is just being able to play weaker frames more easily
[3:11:34] <%LocoCrazy_> it will*
[3:11:34] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat ask Plague about Arcane Helms
[3:11:36] <%Nonsubcasual> i just stopped caring about it at some point, i call it "event guilt"
[3:11:38] <RahuStalker> Well it already returned this time
[3:11:38] <sunny935> it is returning im pretty sure
[3:11:40] <Volkrotia> @valkuma it is that kind of thing. which is why this whole confusion is kinda stupid
[3:11:46] <elementofloyalty> Quils?
[3:11:49] <Twoiis> The last plague star happened 4 months ago.
[3:11:54] <+ruddyredbone> you are good at this point really
[3:12:00] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat Your perception of this stuff is kinda... warped
[3:12:03] <cgmerryo> You don't HAVE to.
[3:12:03] <+valkuma> use your strongest thing for 1 day ... and ignore the event when youre done
[3:12:04] <Zbljuv> you dont "need" any of this game is easy as fuck anyway
[3:12:05] <%HRDSalami654> Exodia aren't that important.
[3:12:09] <%Thelvl1king> Pat you are literally done with the time sensitive part
[3:12:10] <Sloavon> EXODO FLAME
[3:12:11] <Zbljuv> zaws are overkill
[3:12:15] <ShoddySpice> dont worry about the exodus
[3:12:19] <PhantaniumOG> you don't need to they are not that important for you right now
[3:12:21] <Derkinstacker> you REALLY dont need the zaws.
[3:12:22] <Sunstalker> You have enough plat to buyt all of it, Pat. GabeN
[3:12:22] <TheSpartanThief> You can if you WANT to, but you don't have to Pat. It's fine...you can miss shit. I've missed tons!
[3:12:31] <+Jylakir> Pat you dont have to, just get the zaw parts and you're done. The Exodias are nothing for endgame. They are more fun and not mandantonary
[3:12:34] <Volkrotia> Pleas dont worry about the Exodias, You wont even be able to build them till ur maxed with Cetus
[3:12:35] <%Nonsubcasual> its the collector mentality of feeling inefficient
[3:12:36] <NobodyyX> The arcanes are not necessary.
[3:12:38] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Exodia take 100 Wisps each and 30 of rare stones you have no access to and they're only really for high level gimmick builds I'd just skip it
[3:12:38] <Worldbrand> But pat, you have the money for forma. It's 3 for 35p. You'll be okay.
[3:12:40] <MajorCrasher> @angriestpat Plague Star is completely optional, it's not vital to progression or end game, it's just completionist stuff
[3:12:43] <drakthebest> You have 5589 platinum. A forma costs ~12 plat
[3:12:43] <ThalesMeh> Who the fuck said it wouldn't ever return? DE said that it is a recurring event for POE.
[3:12:46] <TheSpartanThief> FUCK
[3:12:47] <drakthebest> Don't worry about it pat
[3:12:49] <+Clemchower> This is best way to get forma correct. But, 3forma costs 35p in market
[3:12:51] <+Shadowthedigger> Eh I guess I haven't noticed that because I'm not doing it solo. I've been using it to farm affinity.
[3:12:54] <+Typhaeon> LuL
[3:12:54] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat the exodias require so many resources and don't give enough benefit for your purposes right now- the only other thing you should get at this point is Snipetron and then you're done
[3:12:55] <Sloavon> uh oh
[3:12:57] <+TheGodfrey> good job
[3:12:58] <DemonicChocobo> The Exodias are VERY difficult to build for a VERY small perk. You will not be able to build them for a LONG time. They're honestly not worth it.
[3:13:01] <TheSpartanThief> Well, I fucked up!
[3:13:02] <%drabberfaun535> i almost never use forma, catalyst work just as fine
[3:13:03] <Derkinstacker> It will come back pat.
[3:13:05] <zakti_prime> it comes back
[3:13:06] <elementofloyalty> :D
[3:13:09] <%ApexWalrus> XD
[3:13:11] <+Shadowthedigger> Like you can do this shit worse stuff.
[3:13:12] <Zbljuv> why you haf to be mad its only game
[3:13:13] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Wait, does Pat think Plague Kripath blueprints disappear after Plague Star ends?
[3:13:13] <OceanGovernor> Exodia the forbidden one?
[3:13:15] <%ApexWalrus> I love this stream
[3:13:16] <elementofloyalty> Whats a facebook?
[3:13:17] <jeppeww> you can get formas from the luna music puzzle
[3:13:19] <+HelloImTom08> pat has the worst personality for warframe LUL
[3:13:23] <%Thelvl1king> Pat they are literally trying to tell you to get stuff you can’t. Listen to brozime just take your time.
[3:13:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Dude, the Exodias are WAY far away, Plaguestar will probably repeat before you can even build them
[3:13:26] <RahuStalker> But pat plaguestar will come back
[3:13:26] <+Alter_Faust> ok pat try to have fun
[3:13:27] <fabnanman> LOL
[3:13:29] <zfenty> what is this facebook thing?
[3:13:39] <+decisivelynameless> Plague Star will happen again.
[3:13:39] <+Shadowthedigger> Not if every person has shit stuff, but if friends or clan mates are running it and don't care about your damage cause they blow it up then who cares as long as you get it done fast.
[3:13:42] <FadingEmber> Care more Pat
[3:13:46] <zakti_prime> also forma is not to hard to get, just do void fissures
[3:13:50] <+ruddyredbone> you didnt care enough to get excalibur prime
[3:13:53] <+decisivelynameless> It's only been 2-3 months since the last tgime
[3:13:58] <+augurgewalt> You only NEED one of each of the strikes for mastery and 10 of each of the arcanes actually
[3:14:03] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat yeah, Pat. You clearly don't care enough about Street Fighter to play enough to get your costumes Kappa
[3:14:06] <lab990> except for excal prime
[3:14:16] <+jestrfestr> @zakti_prime it takes 24 hours to craft, thats the issue
[3:14:16] <Twoiis> Acolytes
[3:14:24] <OceanGovernor> Oof acolytes were a pain
[3:14:25] <%HRDSalami654> Oh no, memeing strike.
[3:14:26] <tierney12> maiming strike and argon scope Kreygasm
[3:14:31] <cgmerryo> 4 months isn't really ludicrous
[3:14:32] <+Jylakir> its just one mod Kappa
[3:14:33] <Derkinstacker> Pat is child trying to be an adult, while plague keeps telling him how awesome being an adult is.
[3:14:35] <drakthebest> Oh yeah acoytes. Those mods are worth 400+ plat
[3:14:36] <sirsirejay> Ugh i hate them
[3:14:39] <Zbljuv> MEME STRIKE
[3:14:39] <SunsetJack> Oh man, you miss the acolyte event...
[3:14:41] <drakthebest> All of them
[3:14:44] <+Clemchower> like you want to farm forma extensively under stress for whole week, and let's say you farmed 90 forma, it will cost 1050platinum to get 90 forma from market. So, calculation is yours depends on your time/money value
[3:14:44] <+Bricespresso> yeah im salt about that
[3:14:47] <elementofloyalty> MONEY BUYS HAPPINESS
[3:14:49] <+unfoldingchoas> level yeah those mods are good i missed them to
[3:14:50] <Narsoma> Full year on acolyte gap, no?
[3:14:54] <sirsirejay> I never get the mods i want
[3:14:58] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Exodia take 100 Wisps each and 30 of rare stones you have no access to for a long time and they're only really for high level gimmick builds I'd just skip it
[3:15:05] <GurrenPrime> im just shocked there was a point where events werent a thing
[3:15:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat YOu wont even be able to build the Exodias until Plagustar comes back
[3:15:08] <+ajcritfumble> i missed acolytes as well :(
[3:15:13] <elementofloyalty> BOLTS WIN YEA
[3:15:17] <Twoiis> The less you know the better?
[3:15:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> #
[3:15:25] <+unfoldingchoas> @ajcritfumble yeah
[3:15:28] <zakti_prime> :(
[3:15:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you have to max Cetus
[3:15:32] <Derkinstacker> Pat you're getting upset over nothing.
[3:15:38] <Brozime> @legendfather_of_giants that's not true
[3:15:39] <%LocoCrazy_> @AngriestPat read Brozime's most recent comment.
[3:15:43] <JimJamr> PAT, WE CARE ABOUT YOU! DO SOMETHING THAT IS FUN FOR YOURSELF
[3:15:44] <+Typhaeon> It's all going to be okay, Pat.
[3:15:48] <Sloavon> is bolt any good? that's my frame
[3:15:51] <GurrenPrime> wasnt the prestige of bird collecting essentially time limited?
[3:16:04] <Thesaltymixture> Pat is approaching frustration singularity
[3:16:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Games like this are dangerous for my wallet because I end up dropping more on em than I ever would on full price games
[3:16:04] <GurrenPrime> wasnt pat racing to be like the first person in the server with all of them or some shit?
[3:16:04] <elementofloyalty> Pat gets pleasure from ELMO
[3:16:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Brozime really? damn, sorry for spreading misinformation them
[3:16:08] <Zepik> it's ok that 75% off plat coupon is coming
[3:16:11] <Laecerelius> you need to be next to max in cetus to get the plans to make the gems but you can also grind plague star even more to buy the wisps and gems!
[3:16:33] <+MarshallLee67> why are they getting so many eidolon lures lmao
[3:16:37] <+MarshallLee67> tell whoever's doing that to stop
[3:16:41] <+Clemchower> dat lure trolling lol
[3:16:41] <OceanGovernor> Once you go loki you never go back LUL
[3:16:54] <SunsetJack> Trinity got harder lol
[3:17:02] <Worldbrand> nekros will be fine if you already went through equinox
[3:17:02] <%HRDSalami654> Poor Pat.
[3:17:03] <tierney12> @Brozime has the supra vandal returned since ambulas reborn?
[3:17:06] <Kratok> Fuck Loki
[3:17:07] <DoubledOgre> as I understand it loki and rhino are the only two frames in the game
[3:17:08] <sirsirejay> Prime are technically the "original"
[3:17:12] <Brozime> @tierney12 not yet
[3:17:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Once you go loki everything else is a jokey
[3:17:25] <HealingMind> Trin isn't THAT hard to buy a set for. Very low demand
[3:17:29] <Zbljuv> rhino will always be that
[3:17:31] <ShoddySpice> I do that but with Chroma.
[3:17:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> pat needs to get a good oberon build going
[3:17:36] <Zbljuv> nothing replaces rhino
[3:17:39] <Jason4567890> Excal is good
[3:17:42] <Laecerelius> i haven't even started to try and do the eidolon stuff. i just turn in the cores i get from killing sentients on lua and the occasional baby one i can find at night on the plains
[3:17:44] <+NekoNinja13> I actually just uninstalled warframe, because i only ever felt "this is cool i guess, but am i doing it yet" and "when do i get to have fun"
[3:17:44] <7o8145> @AngriestPat just remember that nothing in warframe is worth ruining your enjoyment of the game, if you're not having fun grinding something you should stop
[3:17:47] <Zbljuv> rhino is always the right choice
[3:17:51] <SunsetJack> Rhino is THE MOST solid frame in the game.
[3:17:58] <Zbljuv> replace every frame with rhino
[3:17:58] <levitheshark> I use normal Volt right now
[3:18:03] <Sloavon> is volt bad? that's my frame
[3:18:04] <Zbljuv> rhino everywhere system
[3:18:06] <DoubledOgre> the virgin volt vs the chad rhino
[3:18:07] <Kratok> @AngriestPat put the Rhino down, you have a problem
[3:18:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Inaros tho
[3:18:12] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat When the event Operation: Plague Star is not running, the actual Plague zaw parts can not be acquired, they can still appear as part of a complete Zaw in Hok's Daily Specials.
[3:18:14] <Laecerelius> i've been using rhino forever as well lol
[3:18:15] <Volkrotia> Rhino takes the LEAST amount of time to "get good" You need basically no rare mods for him to work in level 50+ content
[3:18:15] <lab990> have you tried oberon pat?
[3:18:18] <IminyourBase> volt = go fast eat ass
[3:18:20] <zakti_prime> eidolon gems and fish are tradable, if he asks his clan somebody probably would give him a deal
[3:18:20] <levitheshark> I haven't had any issues with normal Volt
[3:18:22] <Kratok> @Sloavon it's not 'invulnerable to damage 80% of the time'
[3:18:23] <Zbljuv> inaros is just shitty rhino
[3:18:25] <+fireking900> Atlus has a ton of armor
[3:18:26] <Derkinstacker> Frost with that avalanche mod is pretty solid too.
[3:18:27] <Zbljuv> needs augment to be real rhino
[3:18:29] <SunsetJack> Does Volt need quick thinking?
[3:18:33] <DoubledOgre> inaros is fucking invincible
[3:18:34] <Leoxade> I remember when rhino ult was broken
[3:18:39] <%GarbageNirvana> That new Inaros skin is dope too
[3:18:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> hahaha
[3:18:46] <Laecerelius> not having to deal with status effects is the biggest thing that i love about rhino's ironskin
[3:18:47] <$Yakobro> LOL
[3:18:47] <+Clemchower> your left right tilts
[3:18:48] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Pat you would want Inaros, Nidus
[3:18:51] <tierney12> pat is tilted LUL
[3:18:54] <Volkrotia> OH LOOK HOW FAST UR GOING
[3:18:56] <%the_Missing_d4> hey pat is Paige just the leader of Steel Meridian
[3:18:57] <%Nonsubcasual> its from archwing 1.0
[3:18:57] <Malziel> #JustSkyWingThings zimeLUL
[3:18:59] <+unfoldingchoas> Pat you lean to tank frames, just build those frames first
[3:19:00] <+drecie> it works differently in the plains
[3:19:01] <MMetas> @AngriestPat The thing you're doing is taking that limited time and considering yourself alone, instead just know people are around doing the content in your clan, and are willing to carry you if need be don't sweat it too much and just grab the things that people think are essential.
[3:19:01] <Volkrotia> ITs almost as if you couldve done this the WHOLE TIME
[3:19:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oberon with rage or hunter adrenaline sounds perfect for pat
[3:19:08] <Derkinstacker> Pat needs to farm Nidus, or get Inaros.
[3:19:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> shoot your guns
[3:19:15] <Shooterboy23> How long has Pat been complaining? Oh just about 39 minutes.
[3:19:21] <Malziel> @Volkrotia *he* couldn't though, Pat had to wait for someone else to drop one
[3:19:22] <DoubledOgre> nidus farming sucks though, fuck that mission and rng
[3:19:26] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat the exodias require an absurd amount of resources and the benefits are not worth it- you're better off just buying the Snipetron blueprint (exclusive to plague star) and being done with the event at this point
[3:19:27] <+WizardofWazz> Nidus is a good boy
[3:19:31] <Worldbrand> it's precisely because they're underpowered
[3:19:33] <zfenty> wait you can fly inside now wowwwwwwwwww
[3:19:35] <Volkrotia> @Malziel Which they did in the first runs he just didnt notice the WP they left
[3:19:36] <DoubledOgre> giving people herpes is dope tho
[3:19:36] <wak8299> archwing weapons are traaaash
[3:19:37] <+MarshallLee67> benefits aren't worth it at this point at least
[3:19:38] <Lysdexic9541> It’s so you can do SICK BARREL ROLLS
[3:19:39] <%LocoCrazy_> Because they're heavy as fuck and space kinda removes weight.
[3:19:39] <spry_watchdog> skywing was so much more fun when they were broken fast
[3:19:41] <tierney12> if anything archwing weapons would be underpowered LUL
[3:19:41] <+augurgewalt> Archwing launcher charges were a mistake
[3:19:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> yeah i just bought nidus because fuck farming
[3:19:43] <SunsetJack> Solo the Nidus farming...
[3:19:45] <UvBenServed> I think there's a lore reason that archwing weapons are heavy as shit
[3:19:46] <Derkinstacker> NiCOCK
[3:19:50] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @doubledogre True
[3:19:56] <Malziel> @Volkrotia Oof, that's rough.
[3:19:57] <+Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat Probably because having an infinite regen ammo weapon would be broken.
[3:19:59] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Plague Star just crashed on me because we started sucking vs the boss.
[3:20:04] <%the_Missing_d4> can i join or is that baned
[3:20:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat no, exodias
[3:20:19] <Volkrotia> @Malziel Also hes been running with the same party all day and has been tipped off by Brozime that u can take other ppls charges. No excuse really
[3:20:19] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat no pat, the exodias, not the zaws
[3:20:20] <+Dustwalker44> @AngriestPat You got me into playing Warframe on my ps4. I thank you and curse you at the same time for introducing me to such a great fun addicting game.
[3:20:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat lots of resources for the exodias
[3:20:24] <Worldbrand> I think that's hyperbole
[3:20:26] <Derkinstacker> Plague star will probably be back before you even make it.
[3:20:31] <Kratok> @AngriestPat he was wrong
[3:20:31] <Brozime> @AngriestPat You won't be able to make the Exodia the zaws are totally acheivable
[3:20:34] <+MarshallLee67> BUY SNIPETRON
[3:20:41] <Malziel> @Volkrotia I mean, people should've pointed it out more like plague just did then
[3:20:43] <7o8145> NO DON'T BUY THOSE THEY SUCK
[3:20:45] <%Thelvl1king> Exodia not zaw
[3:20:48] <TheSpartanThief> Well, karma already came for me, I just got Stalker during a No Shields Nightmare mission
[3:20:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> personally, i refuse to mine for shit most of the time
[3:20:49] <Brozime> Exodia are the one fo the largest grindwalls in the game
[3:20:54] <%HRDSalami654> Yes they are.
[3:21:00] <levitheshark> So how often does this event happen?
[3:21:06] <+Clemchower> also, get one [Snipetron blueprine] as it is achievable from this event only at the moment
[3:21:07] <MMetas> In terms of getting 100
[3:21:10] <ThalesMeh> We are screaming about the arcanes. They cost too much and aren't worth it
[3:21:12] <reiju_22> how long will this stream be?
[3:21:13] <MMetas> cetus wisps
[3:21:17] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat PAT YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AND SO HELP ME YOU'RE A GOOD BOI
[3:21:22] <Laecerelius> you can make a rank one exodia by buying the parts from the operational supply store
[3:21:25] <DemonicChocobo> Plague Star grips are very middle-of-the-road in terms of stats. They're okay for absolute utter minmaxing but they're super unimportant overall.
[3:21:28] <+jestrfestr> @AngriestPat you can buy the exodias built for plat from players too if you want
[3:21:40] <%HRDSalami654> IT'S TOTALLY NOT!
[3:21:45] <demonhunter790> What the fuck is this stream
[3:21:47] <+unfoldingchoas> @pimpdaddyprime Good boy with fluffy feet
[3:21:51] <MajorCrasher> Zaws aren't important
[3:21:52] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat exodias are not worth it- buy the Snipetron blueprint- one more runn will get you that weapon and it's exclusive to this event!
[3:22:05] <junipxr> moon2WOW pat's chilling out
[3:22:09] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher I mean, zaws can literally be some of the best melee weapons in the game.
[3:22:13] <sunny935> @AngriestPat ignore the exodia arcanes, need all those materials and only equipable on the zaws
[3:22:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat that's why I didn't do it
[3:22:29] <dsauce999> Is weed legal in Canada yet? Pat might need some.
[3:22:30] <+mikesniderman> snipetron is awful. He can just get the snipetron vandal
[3:22:30] <flyguy2097> If you want a good alternative warframe that has good survivability, get hyrdroid prime. Really high shields and great abilities (IMO)
[3:22:42] <Brozime> @AngriestPat You used to have to grind it for 10 hours before you could start to get rewards at all at this rate
[3:22:47] <Twoiis> I had the experience with the vaulted relics. Running that and grinding void traces.
[3:22:47] <MajorCrasher> @malziel Melee is already the strongest weapon type in the game so zaws being the strongest is incredibly unnecessary
[3:22:50] <+augurgewalt> Last time bounties still were complete trash too
[3:22:51] <Brozime> It was awful at first
[3:22:52] <levitheshark> "end"
[3:22:54] <levitheshark> LUL
[3:22:54] <GurrenPrime> i just want forma but im not doin this shit legendfather_of_giants
[3:23:04] <Rahura159> Right?
[3:23:05] <+NickyDynamite> I think it's because you've listened to too many voices for where you are.
[3:23:05] <%HRDSalami654> It's still pretty awful.
[3:23:07] <$PimpDaddyPrime> He is stressed and he is salt and he has cute feet. Honk honk.
[3:23:08] <SpankyMagoo> and they all are incredibly situational, the exodia contagion is only really useful with dagger zaws
[3:23:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @GurrenPrime oh same, I'm good with fissures
[3:23:10] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher 'eh, disagree with you there. zimeLUL
[3:23:15] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @levitheshark Happened 6 months ago. November of last year was when it happened.
[3:23:15] <%the_Missing_d4> hey pat should Peige cosplay as the leader of steel meridian. they'reboth fuck by messed up clone shit and are badasses.
[3:23:17] <%HRDSalami654> Uh huh.
[3:23:20] <Zbljuv> plague fell asleep
[3:23:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> didnt do ghouls either
[3:23:24] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:23:26] <FlameLoneWolf> Uh huh.
[3:23:28] <+unfoldingchoas> Console doesn't have this event yet
[3:23:30] <junipxr> i actually was AFK for a sec, does pat actually find mobilize and rush useful?
[3:23:31] <GurrenPrime> i dont even remember what im missing im just not running this quest like 10 times a day
[3:23:35] <boatzndhoez534> UH HUH LUL
[3:23:37] <FlameLoneWolf> LUL
[3:23:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol i always completely ignore ghoul purges
[3:23:38] <Rahura159> right
[3:23:41] <+ruddyredbone> well just miss it then
[3:23:41] <7o8145> NICE COAT UH HUH UH HUH UH HUH
[3:23:42] <MajorCrasher> @malziel have you heard of the atterax Nd it's friend the galatine prime?
[3:23:42] <SweetCheeksTrap> I'm the same way Pat
[3:23:44] <Shooterboy23> uhuh
[3:23:46] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Yeah console has never had this event yet
[3:23:47] <Malziel> Plague, you glorious bastard. zimeLUL
[3:23:48] <%HRDSalami654> UH HUH UH HUH.
[3:23:49] <Apolonm> LUL
[3:23:52] <Shooterboy23> uh huhuh huhuh
[3:23:59] <Happyguyelite> Information overload D:
[3:24:04] <SweetCheeksTrap> @AngriestPat I'M THE SAME WAY
[3:24:11] <dsauce999> Uh huh
[3:24:12] <MMetas> @AngriestPat people's insane recommendations come form trying to kill enemies 110 and higher
[3:24:12] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher Yes, I'm well aware, but what if you wanted *variety?* Best dagger, best machete, best polearm etc.
[3:24:13] <+Clemchower> that is because the event is a bit ahead of your current in game progress. You will see later. That's why people are yelling you just stockpile blueprints only atm nomatter what
[3:24:19] <+mikesniderman> Brozime tell him that he can just get forma from relics hella easy
[3:24:27] <+unfoldingchoas> @itheburninatori did we not
[3:24:28] <Rahura159> right
[3:24:33] <+ruddyredbone> nah
[3:24:39] <Brozime> @mikesniderman nah the built forma are super valuable
[3:24:40] <demonhunter790> Stop playing ?
[3:24:45] <%HRDSalami654> But, Pat, that would make sense.
[3:24:49] <%HRDSalami654> You aren't.
[3:24:58] <mcevers> nah nakak stops selling operational supply after the event
[3:24:59] <SunsetJack> People say the items are available via the Zaw Merchant but it is random and only via Plat no?
[3:25:00] <+AcidicHorizon> you can't but the rep carries over tot he next time it shows up
[3:25:03] <%HRDSalami654> They disappear from Nacocks inventory after the event.
[3:25:05] <GurrenPrime> getting made forma like that saves so much time
[3:25:11] <tierney12> remember when you could buy catalysts and forma for 8 plat each Kreygasm
[3:25:12] <Malziel> Aye, DE really needs to keep the rep trader, but fuck us I guess. :/
[3:25:14] <DoubledOgre> this makes me nervous for it coming to ps4
[3:25:21] <spry_watchdog> @AngriestPat you keep your rep but you can't cash it until the event happens again
[3:25:23] <MajorCrasher> @malziel I don't care about those weapon tyoes, though, variety is unnecessary completionist stuff when i already have enough damage
[3:25:28] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat If only the guys at DE had as much common sense as you... Boy, that almost hurt to type...
[3:25:30] <+fireking900> almost 100k meter PogChamp
[3:25:30] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @unfoldingchoas oh no we did. my bad. we just got it 2 weeks later.
[3:25:32] <+XxBig_99xX2> hi
[3:25:33] <TheButtravage> So what is the event about?
[3:25:33] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher Yes, but you =/= pat
[3:25:37] <+NickyDynamite> Unfortunately almost no mmo does that for event stuff. Maybe a couple weeks leeway but none do it for forever
[3:25:54] <%HRDSalami654> Fuck that.
[3:25:56] <+unfoldingchoas> @itheburninatori yeah, i missed it lol
[3:26:05] <+Clemchower> correct
[3:26:13] <%HRDSalami654> You don't need that many.
[3:26:15] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @unfoldingchoas Pretty sure I did also
[3:26:20] <+Clemchower> it means you would like it if you get ### now
[3:26:29] <DantesAnimus> Don't give up Skeleton!
[3:26:30] <sirsirejay> Does your rep stay from the prior event? I play ps4 so it hasn't come back yet
[3:26:42] <+XxBig_99xX2> @AngriestPat how do you get plague star on ps4 i cant we dont have the plague BTW i just join and i like ur stream already :)
[3:26:42] <OceanGovernor> Stay determined Pat!
[3:26:44] <%HRDSalami654> Pretty much.
[3:26:45] <Malziel> @sirsirejay Aye it stays but you just can't access it
[3:26:46] <+Clemchower> ironic i see
[3:26:50] <Derkinstacker> Nailed it.
[3:26:55] <Derkinstacker> Really?
[3:26:55] <sirsirejay> Thanks
[3:26:59] <Malziel> np ^^
[3:27:00] <laguerrilha> me 2
[3:27:04] <+gozzojt27> im pretty suprised they did ghouls and plaguestar at the same time, thats rough
[3:27:10] <%HRDSalami654> The time limited nature of Plague Star fill you with... determination.
[3:27:10] <+unfoldingchoas> @xxbig_99xx2 console has to wait a little
[3:27:14] <%HRDSalami654> lol
[3:27:22] <Happyguyelite> 1.50 🤔
[3:27:29] <+XxBig_99xX2> : @AngriestPat how do you get plague star on ps4 i cant we dont have the plague BTW i just join and i like ur stream already :)
[3:27:37] <%cryobyjorn> It's basically free
[3:27:45] <dsauce999> Now Pat is LOSING his FREE Mony!
[3:27:46] <+ruddyredbone> if you like rhino you can forma anytime
[3:27:47] <Zbljuv> but the game gives you free money it might as well take some back
[3:27:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @XxBig_99xX2 Plaguestar is coming to console very soon
[3:27:54] <Shinmaddrox> I'm sitting on like 25 formas. I would much rather have orokin reactors and shit.
[3:27:55] <tierney12> @XxBig_99xX2 plague star will be on console probably in 2-5 weeks
[3:27:55] <+drecie> you can forma weapons too
[3:27:58] <Twoiis> I'd say that's normal.
[3:28:04] <Shooterboy23> You can use a Forma to get Jetstream Sams sword though @AngriestPat
[3:28:05] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @gozzojt27 Yeah because they were introducing it at the same time.
[3:28:08] <+XxBig_99xX2> @unfoldingchoas how long and he's playing ps4 right and how
[3:28:12] <+fireking900> I dont even know what a forma dose all i know I need it
[3:28:19] <DoubledOgre> he's on pc
[3:28:20] <tierney12> @XxBig_99xX2 pat is playing on pc
[3:28:22] <MMetas> YEAH! Volt is good support boi
[3:28:22] <+mikesniderman> shooter which sword
[3:28:24] <biomegabear> Does pat know about the chair?
[3:28:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i have 18 orokin reactors and no forma because of obsessive tendencies
[3:28:29] <$Pacohax> I’m basically building a guild from the ground up and that’s all of my forma
[3:28:34] <+XxBig_99xX2> With ps4 controller ?
[3:28:35] <+Rezca> wait, Plague has all the corrupted mods?
[3:28:37] <SpankyMagoo> thats when it gets real fun messing with augments and stuff
[3:28:42] <cgmerryo> what
[3:28:43] <Happyguyelite> @AngriestPat I have over 1000 hours and haven't used forma D:
[3:28:45] <+unfoldingchoas> @xxbig_99xx2 i though he playing pc with a ps4 controller
[3:28:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @fireking900 it changes a mod slot's polarity, where its drain is decreased or increased based on the symbol
[3:28:47] <Malziel> @XxBig_99xX2 Aye, he's pc with a controller.
[3:28:52] <Zbljuv> you dont need to forma rhino its all good
[3:28:54] <sirsirejay> Y'know whats a farm nightmare, fucking vauban prime
[3:28:56] <+zork990> i didn't forma anything for like 3 years
[3:28:57] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat no need to be stingy with forma, once you start doing fissures regularly you'll be drowning in them
[3:28:58] <ThalesMeh> @Rezca None of them
[3:28:59] <%HRDSalami654> Plague lies!
[3:29:00] <Malziel> The most hilarious part is the Tigris Prime only needs one forma zimeLUL
[3:29:05] <%HRDSalami654> FORMA ALL THE THINGS!
[3:29:08] <tierney12> @XxBig_99xX2 that should be obvious, look at how the frame rate isn't shit LUL
[3:29:13] <Zbljuv> you need primed mods for vaykor hek
[3:29:13] <Mashn1> Whats a warframe
[3:29:14] <laguerrilha> afraid to waste a forma since i dont have a Prime Warframe
[3:29:16] <+augurgewalt> Tigris prime is the best
[3:29:25] <EDFscout> I neither formad anything for the longest time sonce i have catalysts and reactors out the ass
[3:29:27] <Malziel> @Mashn1 A walking WMD that you can control :'D
[3:29:32] <jkeelan> I can't wait until Pat needs nitain extract.
[3:29:34] <+NickyDynamite> You're own craziness
[3:29:37] <ShoddySpice> @sirsirejay It's not even farming it's just wait until you have a chance to get more damn Nitain
[3:29:47] <DoubledOgre> don't know whether to forma base rhino or wait to see whats unvaulted next
[3:29:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> tigris prime is far and away the most op gun in relation to the effort it takes to build
[3:29:50] <TheButtravage> What is the purpose of the current event?
[3:29:57] <+iGunnerz> anyone know the reward for doing this event?
[3:29:58] <sirsirejay> I'm stuck on the nitains
[3:29:59] <EDFscout> BABY
[3:30:00] <+AntithesisEK> it's a pretty bad event though
[3:30:02] <Malziel> @DoubledOgre You can always get more forma :D
[3:30:04] <+fireking900> @legendfather_of_giants thats really good holyshit do you choose the polarity?
[3:30:05] <+JoeStillLife> sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby
[3:30:10] <+unfoldingchoas> @jkeelan yeah those are hard
[3:30:10] <+timtheinchanter> The baby
[3:30:11] <%HRDSalami654> They'
[3:30:12] <Fat_Gaz> DA BABY
[3:30:17] <sirsirejay> The oxium farm killed me
[3:30:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @iGunnerz you can buy built formas and special zaw parts
[3:30:19] <biomegabear> can't hear it
[3:30:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> @fireking900 yep
[3:30:25] <dsauce999> #Elmoments!
[3:30:27] <Zbljuv> blade and soul has events on 100% of the time
[3:30:27] <junipxr> moon2E
[3:30:27] <+AntithesisEK> yes you choose the polarity
[3:30:29] <MMetas> @AngriestPat the thing that may happen is the same with unvaulting and that's bringing back events form the past
[3:30:30] <%trowa_2002> @AngriestPat you are good and you are sweet and you have nice feet. Beep beep. apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[3:30:32] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @augurgewalt I love the Sancti Tigris but they're both great
[3:30:42] <+Ryo_no_Kage> BABY SCREM!
[3:30:47] <laguerrilha> @AngriestPat What should i farm on this event?
[3:30:48] <Malziel> Yeah, Plague Star is the first time DE have re-ran a major event. (Whereas ghouls came out when they said it would be ran again)
[3:30:58] <Malziel> Hopefully we get some of the other OG events now
[3:31:00] <+Clemchower> by that time, there will be a new event or several new event lol
[3:31:00] <+fireking900> @legendfather_of_giants ty for the tip!
[3:31:04] <+decisivelynameless> The real reason this is frustrating is because there are a ton of vet players screaming about it at someone that has no context for the event or it's rewards.
[3:31:12] <dsauce999> So when pat has 5 exodias, does he just win the game?
[3:31:14] <Klefth> Man, has anyone had that glitch where you use 4 with Excal and you get stuck unable to shoot or melee at all and it just says "ability in use"?
[3:31:23] <Malziel> @dsauce999 Not quite. zimeLUL
[3:31:27] <+ruddyredbone> big bab
[3:31:27] <+Ches_Neckbeard> !uptime
[3:31:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 31m 36s.
[3:31:42] <SweetCheeksTrap> I used to be the same way with Overwatch Skins
[3:31:45] <+decisivelynameless> It's infinitely less frustrating if you just notice on your own time and people can talk to you without a dozen people screaming about how MUCH YOU NEED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:31:46] <%HRDSalami654> Oh boy.
[3:31:59] <SweetCheeksTrap> But I wasn't so crazy that I would spend hundreds of dollars on loot boxes
[3:32:05] <%Thelvl1king> @pat treat it like the deviljho event
[3:32:09] <Happyguyelite> D: ?
[3:32:11] <Happyguyelite> Wow
[3:32:16] <+OuijaTears> oh come on
[3:32:17] <MMetas> Yeah, excal prime was the worst
[3:32:25] <ThePlotHole> You're damn dense if you think that
[3:32:28] <aeonicvector> But atleast excal umbra is coming
[3:32:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat just wait for Excalibur Umbra
[3:32:29] <DoubledOgre> umbra soon Kappa
[3:32:30] <Derkinstacker> Get excalibur umbra
[3:32:34] <Zbljuv> founders need something you fucks
[3:32:36] <Malziel> @Derkinstacker SoonTM
[3:32:38] <MMetas> Absolutely the worst because completionism
[3:32:38] <%commanderclaw> The login shit is bullshit
[3:32:41] <rocketopaunch> escal p is pretty justified
[3:32:45] <+unfoldingchoas> Yeah Excalibur prime, Console cant get it
[3:32:46] <$Bane_Kaikyo> ok, I just Pm'd Pat some encouraging words, I feel like I have halped :3
[3:32:46] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat Even DE agrees that they fucked up there
[3:32:48] <+Shadowthedigger> Wow
[3:32:50] <MajorCrasher> Excal prime is basically excal but 25 more armor, almost no difference
[3:32:52] <$Pacohax> I’m afraid to even touch the event so I’ll probably miss out on the stuff for a long while
[3:32:53] <Thesaltymixture> Yea but excal prime is not that good
[3:32:55] <+zork990> i have excal prime, but i have more time played as regular excal LUL
[3:32:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> excal prime is ugly af though
[3:32:59] <MMetas> There's absolutely nothing more infuriating than not having a complere collection
[3:33:07] <+AntithesisEK> 5 forma excal because he is a good boy cantaFeelsGreat
[3:33:08] <xemeas> Yeah that fucked with me
[3:33:11] <MMetas> Even if it's shitty
[3:33:12] <MMetas> I WANT IT
[3:33:20] <MajorCrasher> Excal prime is irrelevant
[3:33:22] <DroppingDead> why is this is an issue? it was a reward for people backing the game in its early phase
[3:33:27] <+ajcritfumble> people over react about Excalibur, people shit them selves over what is essentially 25 armour and vors key stuck to his face
[3:33:31] <GiantRobort> its a non issue
[3:33:33] <MMetas> It's not whether or not it's good or terrible
[3:33:35] <Zbljuv> but you will never have prime
[3:33:35] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher Not at all. Fashionframe is endgame, and Excal Prime is fucking glorious
[3:33:36] <GiantRobort> but because pat
[3:33:39] <Zbljuv> dont let it set in
[3:33:39] <+unfoldingchoas> @thesaltymixture true lol
[3:33:41] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Sad thing is you have to touch the non prime versions to raise your MR
[3:33:47] <Worldbrand> Was it the vauban chassis or neuroptics you were missing? The chassis is on alert
[3:33:47] <aslfrasle> Ironically, When I got back into Warframe after watching Pat, I forgot I was a founder and still had my Excal Prime.
[3:33:48] <fazoburquina> Excal Umbra > Excal Prime
[3:33:57] <%HRDSalami654> The helmet is atrocious.
[3:33:58] <+Shadowthedigger> Just wow.
[3:33:59] <MMetas> Literally nothing to do with how good its stats are at all
[3:33:59] <MajorCrasher> I actually really don't like how excal prime looks
[3:34:06] <Cowctus> Well, Excalibur Prime has a huge benefit in Void
[3:34:08] <%HRDSalami654> Duckcalibur Prime.
[3:34:08] <MMetas> or how it looks
[3:34:14] <$PimpDaddyPrime> @AngriestPat Arcane Helms upset me as much, if not more
[3:34:17] <Narsoma> Void key + Excal face = Excal Prime
[3:34:36] <+ajcritfumble> @cowctus only the same benifits any prime has in the void thats completely irrelevant
[3:34:47] <GurrenPrime> i think prime nova was brand new when i started playing
[3:34:51] <DoubledOgre> disney vault
[3:34:51] <GurrenPrime> so seeing this vault shit is weird
[3:35:01] <Malziel> @PimpDaddyPrime You can still trade for them though
[3:35:05] <TheButtravage> I have no idea what these nerds are talking about, oh man...
[3:35:07] <+AntithesisEK> vaulting is exclusively for money, there is no other justification. Cyclical inflation.
[3:35:08] <ThalesMeh> ...Why Pat
[3:35:12] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not the Disney vault
[3:35:12] <+zork990> they need to vault stuff or else the drop tables for primes would suck, like it would be impossible ro farm for 1 thing
[3:35:13] <laguerrilha> Cant they explain it? i am new and dont get it eithr
[3:35:13] <%HRDSalami654> It's to try and control the drop tables so they don't get oversaturated.
[3:35:14] <CertainlySyrix> except you can still get them for free completely, at any time, with platinum
[3:35:16] <NDHCemployee> @AngriestPat It used to be that way, the unvaultings are fairly new
[3:35:29] <%commanderclaw> Just unvault everything you fucks, why you do this DE
[3:35:39] <+OuijaTears> im so pissed about umbra being a thing....
[3:35:42] <+ajcritfumble> the games free, they gotta get their cut somewhere to you know, make the game
[3:35:46] <Malziel> ^
[3:35:47] <+jestrfestr> player market = plat sales
[3:35:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @commanderclaw because then the plat economy is fucked
[3:35:54] <+gamerboy385> bring it out of the Disney vault
[3:36:01] <Malziel> Except the plat market is fine?
[3:36:06] <+AcidicHorizon> wut? i think u r wrong
[3:36:09] <MajorCrasher> why would you be mad about Umbra? no knows what it is
[3:36:10] <Malziel> The only fucked thing is the riven market
[3:36:14] <DoubledOgre> going in trade chat gives me anxiety
[3:36:15] <+mcjimbo12> I always played Rhino when I played warframe, he's a super cool dude
[3:36:17] <Thalchampz> LUL
[3:36:22] <Malziel> @DoubledOgre use *** my man
[3:36:23] <%commanderclaw> @legendfather_of_giants Do it over an extended period of time
[3:36:24] <Leoxade> @AngriestPat I farmed for rhino back in the day doing the boss mission everyday
[3:36:25] <Malziel> whoops
[3:36:26] <+unfoldingchoas> I wish the old farm system is back for farm prime stuff, i lived running missions forever
[3:36:27] <MMetas> Friendzone how much for a rhino prime
[3:36:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Got all the pieces for Mirage Prime the other day
[3:36:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> all of the assholes in warframe are in the trade chat
[3:36:36] <Malziel> Warframe market website for trading zimeLUL
[3:36:43] <+Ondartyr> Rhino is the true Daddyframe
[3:36:45] <%the_Missing_d4> kinky
[3:36:46] <fazoburquina> its raining plat
[3:36:49] <+Typhaeon> Friendzone is Warframe Hedonism Bot
[3:36:50] <tierney12> @Brozime do you ever miss T4 Def/Survival?
[3:36:56] <biomegabear> I want to try warframe but I don't have cool stuff
[3:37:00] <+ajcritfumble> the plat market is weird for handful of overpriced things and the riven markrt is crazy but otherwise its fine
[3:37:00] <@BigNaturalMan59> thebetCas
[3:37:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> Did he get Maiming Strike yet?
[3:37:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> *** id the best
[3:37:04] <+jestrfestr> dont use trade chat, its terible use warframe dot market
[3:37:06] <+zork990> primes used to have like almost no differences... and i liked that about primes, but then de was like lets make prime warframes way better for some reason
[3:37:11] <Brozime> @tierney12 no
[3:37:11] <+zork990> in stats
[3:37:13] <reonome> @commanderclaw that'll just fuck the plat market over a longer period of time
[3:37:13] <YautjaBorne> what best to farm neo relics
[3:37:26] <CertainlySyrix> people put fake listings on warframe market to inflate or deflate prices @jestrfestr
[3:37:27] <+unfoldingchoas> @mmetas it can be a lot, but average 200 to 250,
[3:37:28] <Malziel> @YautjaBorne Xini, hydron
[3:37:28] <DoubledOgre> LUL
[3:37:29] <+ajcritfumble> fuck maiming strike it's overpriced and boring
[3:37:31] <Derkinstacker> Surprised he didn't buy the,
[3:37:38] <+AntithesisEK> left stick centers you on a controller
[3:37:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat other stick pat
[3:37:43] <+d00msdaydan> HOW CAN THIS BE
[3:37:47] <Ashratcliffe1992> How much have they added to this game? I can't remember any of this when I played it.
[3:37:48] <MMetas> @AngriestPat let go of the sprint button
[3:37:48] <+Clemchower> haha that sums up about archwing
[3:37:49] <$sassyquatch963> like a plane?
[3:37:51] <dsauce999> THESE MUTHERFUKKIN CHOMP CHOMPS!
[3:37:52] <Zbljuv> just go straight
[3:38:01] <+unfoldingchoas> i remember when ember was going for almost 1000 plat
[3:38:04] <$sassyquatch963> i think the control like a plane
[3:38:04] <RazielBlair> Well seems like pat wont be playing warframe for much longer with the way things are going
[3:38:04] <CertainlySyrix> Skywing is actually the only situation in which I enjoy how Archwing controls
[3:38:05] <DoubledOgre> I can't complete saturn because of this shitty archwing mission
[3:38:06] <+Clemchower> go straight LUL
[3:38:08] <Worldbrand> Pat, I guarantee that at least one other person feels that about every way they've implemented Archwing
[3:38:16] <+AngriestAngryArtist> lol Elmo
[3:38:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @DoubledOgre the pursuit, yeah that one sucks
[3:38:18] <FrostedZaibatsu> Maiming strike is the best doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub
[3:38:26] <sirsirejay> I hate Archwings they're useless practically to me
[3:38:28] <+unfoldingchoas> Know arcane energize set us like 1000
[3:38:33] <+ajcritfumble> because youre in atmosphere? maybe thats why they charged the controls for plains
[3:38:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i like maiming trike if its part of a riven
[3:38:44] <tierney12> i loathe the new system, i much prefered when drops were tied to mission types, like nova chassis on rotation c of ODS etc. made things much easier for solo players
[3:38:52] <sirsirejay> Why Archwing when i own Zephyr
[3:38:54] <reonome> gee maybe you should raise the donation amount for messages pat
[3:38:54] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Funny thing is the Arching in space control great now, they used to control the way they do now in POE
[3:38:55] <Malziel> Dude fuck the old system
[3:39:01] <Malziel> The old tower system was *cancer*
[3:39:01] <ArcticAsylum> It's almost like people shouldn't give money to people who play video games LUL
[3:39:02] <Everpresent_Overseer> When Baro shows up with Archwing stuff it makes me sad
[3:39:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @tierney12 a lot of them still are tho
[3:39:07] <dmac63> THE BABY
[3:39:10] <+augurgewalt> It doesn't help that the better equipment for archwing is double-locked behind syndicates and low-priority clan research
[3:39:14] <+Pnutz_> it's a good thing I can live with a couple frames, the valuing system would kill me
[3:39:20] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Archwing*
[3:39:20] <%TheMattman1313> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[3:39:27] <+Stumpyjim> Man, Archwing is my least favourite addition to the game, and its the main reason I hate doing uranus missions
[3:39:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> old system favored people who could do three hours of survival unbelievably heavily
[3:39:31] <+Pnutz_> vaulting*
[3:39:41] <$PimpDaddyPrime> Plague would rather constant, reliable income? The fuck? That's crazy
[3:39:42] <%Thraximunday> @AngriestPat What's your second favorite Warframe?
[3:39:48] <%the_Missing_d4> I love you Eli

[3:40:38] <ThalesMeh> old system was horrible for warframe. Hours in the same fucking tile was so fucking boring.

[3:42:29] <Shinmaddrox> Oh yeah. You got to hope to get 3 alad V cordinates jsut to do one run at Alad V to hope to get one of the 3 pieces for the warframe. God forbid the game give you the same damn piece 8 times in a row. FML.
[3:42:29] <%MisterCrimson> Its the same reaction I have to robot porn. It's like, why?
[3:42:29] <+Ryo_no_Kage> NECROMANCING

[3:42:30] <%riantDeliration> how does Valkyrs lore fit into that tho
[3:42:31] <HypeArbalest> ...I feel bad now
[3:42:31] <FlameLoneWolf> Anime has gotten people attracted to worse.
[3:42:33] <Cowctus> Where is my Buff Chick frame though
[3:42:33] <demonhunter790> Warframe porn is pretty well made.

[3:42:41] <randoli_spugoli> It looks like a woman in a skin tight suit, it's not rocket science
[3:42:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hey,if the tenno are short because they're space children imbued with the void or whatever, then what the fuck is up with the people who live in cetus?
[3:42:44] <Dartonus> nah, from Alad V's comments it seems they don't have anything recognizable in there so it's less a corpse, more a humanoid lump of like meatloaf or something
[3:42:47] <+ajcritfumble> DOESNT MEAN IT AINT THICC THO
[3:42:47] <+WizardofWazz> :^(
[3:42:47] <+AntithesisEK> besides, are you blissfully unaware of latex fetishes?
[3:42:50] <Brozime> @AngriestPat It's because before operators used to not exist and headcanon for many people was that they were like exosuits
[3:42:55] <tierney12> too much futa in the warframe r34 imo OpieOP
[3:42:57] <%commanderclaw> I'd fuck a Zerg girl
[3:43:02] <Brozime> That's what I assume anyway

[3:43:05] <caja_de_ojos> Is like the leather thing
[3:43:08] <ThalesMeh> I don't know what is weirder. A metalic infested puppet with sexy curves or the fact that it is mind controled by a fucking 1000 years child
[3:43:11] <+Namhart> I figure it's basically the equivalent fetish to skin-tight leather bodysuits, like with Catwoman.
[3:43:16] <$PimpDaddyPrime> sooooo... who runs a cam thing? My friend wants to know
[3:43:22] <+unfoldingchoas> I dont know, val hek ass, and sexy val hek

[3:46:45] <%HRDSalami654> THE Kela de Thaym!
[3:46:47] <%vampireinarm> Making Chroma was the biggest fucken headache ive ever gone through, but his deluxe skin made it worth it, sortaa

[3:47:16] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat hey you should buy the snipetron blueprint from nakak- it's the only place you can buy it anymore
[3:47:27] <sunny935> btw you took off power drift for mobilize which took off your 15% power strength @AngriestPat
[3:47:30] <%MisterCrimson> Is there any purpose to Ayatan Stars aside from selling them for Endo?
[3:47:32] <Everpresent_Overseer> I am glad I made chroma before Kela De Thaym was a thing
[3:47:36] <ShoddySpice> Maxing out all the Primed mods dropped me down to 500k credits

[3:47:44] <reonome> promo code patB
[3:47:47] <aslfrasle> @AngriestPat There's a list online of where to get the components for every warframe.
[3:47:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @MisterCrimson you put them in sculptures to make them sell for way more Endo
[3:47:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> deluxe chroma skin is probably the most notable improvement over the base frame

[3:48:24] <Everpresent_Overseer> @fruit_pie_the_magician Also gives Chroma an extra attachment wings
[3:48:29] <+fireking900> The coolest part about Chroma is that energy color changes element
[3:48:33] <dsauce999> Give Pat Plat with referral code WOOLIEM!
[3:48:35] <+Clemchower> it's harry potter spell drawing game
[3:48:38] <grayjammer> Mining “””fun”””
[3:48:44] <ThalesMeh> Chroma had something like 99% damage reduction because armor shenanigans and the damage output of a thousand suns
[3:48:55] <DoubledOgre> draw dickbutt with the mining laser
[3:48:56] <+MarshallLee67> oh okay lmao
[3:49:08] <+zork990> do you have ether daggers though?

[3:53:33] <Everpresent_Overseer> @AngriestPat If you miss a day Vay Hek should scream at you and mock you in log in
[3:53:33] <Worldbrand> There were no 100-day items back then, thankfully
[3:53:34] <DoubledOgre> I got 1 of each tox/status mod from corrupted vore in my first 4 runs

[3:53:55] <rocketopaunch> its Lato
[3:53:55] <Malziel> Lato @GrimHeaper323
[3:53:56] <aslfrasle> Nah Spunf, PLAY Warframe while watching someone else play Warframe.
[3:53:56] <+AcidicHorizon> *Lato
[3:53:57] <MajorCrasher> Lato prime not Ito
[3:53:59] <Shinmaddrox> Excalibur Prime never made it to the consoles
[3:54:00] <+d00msdaydan> not hard enough apparently if he's calling it ito
[3:54:01] <sirsirejay> Lato
[3:54:01] <GrimHeaper323> yea i know
[3:54:01] <Malziel> Lato isn't even good though. zimeLUL
[3:54:01] <Dyshiono> Lato Pat xD
[3:54:02] <Zbljuv> lato its lato
[3:54:03] <KTDelgado> ITS L A T O
[3:54:03] <mcevers> si[ra vandal
[3:54:05] <IminyourBase> wait til he looks up the supra vandal OpieOP
[3:54:06] <+AcidicHorizon> LATO IS BAD PLAUGE
[3:54:08] <GrimHeaper323> but LUL IATO
[3:54:08] <Worldbrand> He must have read it lowercase
[3:54:09] <mcevers> supra candal has not come back
[3:54:09] <Zbljuv> lato prime isnt good
[3:54:11] <+Cobra743> lato and skana prime suck shit
[3:54:15] <dsauce999> L A T O P R I M E !
[3:54:16] <junipxr> L LUL T O
[3:54:17] <NinjaTB> LATO PRIME WITH AN L
[3:54:19] <7o8145> Lato prime fuicken $250 gun
[3:54:20] <+Clemchower> also lato vandal
[3:54:21] <Quietshun13> Why would you want Lato and Skana prime anyway
[3:54:25] <%MisterCrimson> SOna Prime? As in the rifle I got through Twitch Prime?
[3:54:25] <+AcidicHorizon> Gun is bad
[3:54:28] <bbjohnny1> @AngriestPat tbh, excalibur prime is not that much better than the original one
[3:54:29] <fazoburquina> Lato is not good, the prime is not much better
[3:54:30] <OceanGovernor> those weapons are just for shiny bragging rights for saving Warframe LUL
[3:54:30] <MajorCrasher> Don't feel bad pat, consoles never got Excal or any of the weapons
[3:54:34] <+edited156> I think I have a Lato Prime blueprint?
[3:54:39] <+Razputin217> doesn't Baro sell the Supra Vandal at times?
[3:54:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> we dont talk about Conclave
[3:54:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> eh, they had to give fancy things to the people who gave them tons of money for basically no reason
[3:54:41] <KingSpunf> (also Canadian)
[3:54:41] <dsauce999> DIG UP FASTER STOOPID!
[3:54:41] <theicebear85> the game would not exist without the help of the founders. its totally acceptable for them to have these three things.
[3:54:44] <EASrake> We're not toxic? Fuck you
[3:54:47] <Worldbrand> It's not just that it's noncompetitive, it's that you can't interfere with another player's gameplay... usually. See limbo.
[3:54:49] <iusetheinternet> iato prime with the prime black katana skeletons
[3:54:52] <@Mechz71> The Skana Prime and Lato Prime suck a lot. Oh no you can't get some shitty weapons
[3:54:53] <%GarbageNirvana> I've still run into assholes, alas
[3:54:54] <Shinmaddrox> I Had a Lato prime. It wasn't something amazing.
[3:54:55] <%DoctorPavel4U> I C E M A G E
[3:55:03] <NinjaTB> there are no blueprints for lato/skana/excal prime
[3:55:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Mechz71 MR fodder tho
[3:55:05] <spry_watchdog> @bbjohnny1 he knows it's not much better he's just mad he can't get it.
[3:55:06] <+fireking900> do people play Conclave ?
[3:55:06] <Valask> Wait, I thought the FF14 people were supposed to be nice
[3:55:12] <%captainthunderwolf> Excalibur Prime is actually a bad frame, which makes it more endearing.
[3:55:13] <+ajcritfumble> @theicebear85 i completely 100% agree with you it doesnt bother me in the slightest
[3:55:18] <%DoctorPavel4U> Only on certain servers
[3:55:21] <kelevera666> @AngriestPat sedna boss gives you saryn parts
[3:55:21] <junipxr> SPY MISSIONS LUL
[3:55:22] <NinjaTB> speaking of which, did the braton vandel ever come back?
[3:55:23] <Daniel_Is_I> UNLESS YOU'RE LIMBO
[3:55:24] <ThalesMeh> Forget about these primes. They are just a status symbol for the founders.
[3:55:25] <Derrigan> Apart from the spy missions
[3:55:28] <+Thepothero> @valask they are but every game has its diks
[3:55:29] <DantesAnimus> Unless it's stealth\
[3:55:31] <MajorCrasher> Excepy spy
[3:55:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> after 2500 hours i'm only mastery 19 because fuck mastery
[3:55:42] <VespersMalaria> preach it brother
[3:55:42] <sirsirejay> Only toxic thing i run into are asshole limbos
[3:55:43] <%cryobyjorn> Except SPY
[3:55:45] <+Shadowthedigger> EXCEPT FOR SORTIE SPY MISSIONS SeemsGood
[3:55:53] <Malziel> Limbo is fine, some people are just asshats
[3:55:53] <Volkrotia> Correction, BAD Limbo's ruin the game
[3:55:54] <IminyourBase> there was already a limbo rework
[3:55:56] <xemeas> No you dont get it, im a icemage
[3:55:57] <Valask> I play Dota FeelsGoodMan //
[3:56:00] <Malziel> @Volkrotia Exactly!
[3:56:01] <OceanGovernor> sortie spy missions holy shit LUL
[3:56:05] <fazoburquina> good limbos are amazing but incredily rare
[3:56:06] <reonome> LUL
[3:56:11] <+Razputin217> Limbo = fuck your teammates
[3:56:11] <KTDelgado> they already rewrote limbo
[3:56:12] <%Solidnick18> hoo boy
[3:56:14] <dsauce999> LUL
[3:56:15] <Volkrotia> Bad Limbos dont know that they can uncast their 4
[3:56:17] <Shinmaddrox> @Volkrotia That is what people were saying, yes. no need for a correction
[3:56:17] <MajorCrasher> Limbo is fine in solo, or if you know how to play around him
[3:56:18] <bbjohnny1> @spry_watchdog i know, but considering the fact that people payed 250 dollars to support the company in the darkest of hours, it kinda makes sense that it's an exclusive thing
[3:56:18] <flyguy2097> limbo is a fun warframe! as long as you're the one playing it, and you're alone
[3:56:23] <KTDelgado> reworked*
[3:56:29] <MMetas> Limbo works ez in all spy missions when you're smaaaaart
[3:56:32] <+gozzojt27> that sounds like sorties
[3:56:34] <Malziel> @flyguy2097 You can play limbo and not be a douche, it's not that hard. :p
[3:56:38] <FadingEmber> I ignored the Limbo mission to rush Second Dream. What is wrong with him?
[3:56:38] <Macfine> there is a step between learning and farm even
[3:56:39] <lab990> it used to
[3:56:40] <aslfrasle> Dammit Pat, now I'm having Vault flashbacks.
[3:56:41] <tierney12> it super did with raids though @AngriestPat
[3:56:47] <reonome> do your goddamn job you skrubs
[3:56:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Even if the limbo isn't a jerk he makes the match boring by forcing a playstyle on people
[3:56:57] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Raids were like that and they actually just got taken out of the game
[3:56:58] <Copperage> Raids were exactly what you just said @AngriestPat
[3:56:58] <EASrake> well there's recruiting chat at least
[3:56:58] <Valask> question from a person that doesn't play this: why is jumping around like a crazy idiot?
[3:57:08] <+gozzojt27> not sorties, raids
[3:57:09] <+Ryo_no_Kage> THE. BABY>
[3:57:09] <tierney12> fuck limbos who didn't build primed flow in the law of retribution
[3:57:14] <+Namhart> Didn't it used to have a matchmaking or auto party system in Warframe?
[3:57:15] <gunsrlove> @AngriestPat Warframe does have that to an extent in the Triple Eidolon Bounty
[3:57:16] <Malziel> @fruit_pie_the_magician You could say the same thing about warframes that kill loads of enemies quickly. That's not an issue.
[3:57:17] <+ragnarokaftershock> @Valask fastest method of movement
[3:57:17] <tierney12> *lokis
[3:57:18] <%captainthunderwolf> To get around fast, @Valask
[3:57:18] <+MarshallLee67> ugh the fact that there's no matchmaking for derelict is so stupid considering it's the only viable place to farm mutagen samples for hema
[3:57:18] <%MisterCrimson> @Valask because that makes you move faster
[3:57:18] <flyguy2097> granted, people CAN run limbo with others without being an ass
[3:57:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat there were raids, but they're gone now
[3:57:19] <DoubledOgre> big dumb air flips is the movement meta
[3:57:19] <jeppeww> @AngriestPat there's totally stuff like that regarding the eidolons

[3:57:44] <DonatelloJose> The baby has arrived.
[3:57:47] <spry_watchdog> @bbjohnny1 oh I know it should remain exclusive as i'm a founder, i was just explaining that he was angry about it being exclusive
[3:57:49] <Dartonus> @Valask the parkour tricks and stuff are faster than running in many cases, Rhino (the one he's using) is slow on foot
[3:57:49] <Valask> any game that has rolling that is faster than walking looks ridiculous
[3:57:53] <%ssaryn> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[3:57:55] <Shinmaddrox> How the hell Am I meeting MR4's in the Void missions on the way to MOT? They shouldn't be able to get to those damn missions.
[3:57:56] <+Clemchower> stasis nope.
[3:58:00] <%cryobyjorn> Why you heft to be mad
[3:58:01] <+Thepothero> elmo rooAww
[3:58:07] <Valask> Eh, guess I have to play it to know
[3:58:09] <Everpresent_Overseer> Warframe need more fancy shoulder floaty things
[3:58:09] <%Solidnick18> da baby will make it better
[3:58:11] <+ragnarokaftershock> @Valask it looks a lot better when you're climbing walls etc instead of the Plains
[3:58:17] <Lysdexic9541> Is onli gaem
[3:58:17] <%captainthunderwolf> @Valask Real life has rolling that's fast than walking.
[3:58:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @malziel I guess,but if enemies are being killed I can still interact with them in some way, its not "stand here and use melee"
[3:58:20] <RevenTheLight> So what's the point of Plague Star? I ran it a couple of times and it was fun, I never got anything "awesome", per say
[3:58:22] <Bouldus> elmo drink redbull!
[3:58:22] <@BigNaturalMan59> ive never spoken to a single person in warframe
[3:58:25] <SainVt> hey pat, how you doing
[3:58:27] <GiantRobort> people fucking up the sedna boss is the only thing that gets to me
[3:58:28] <%captainthunderwolf> @Valask It's just tough to do that repeatedly.
[3:58:29] <applesonthemoon> good to see pat being happy again :)
[3:58:31] <Valask> @captainthunderwolf wh- sure
[3:58:34] <%cryobyjorn> apatPorgmo
[3:58:35] <+Venhammer> sorties can get difficult with certain modifiers
[3:58:38] <Malziel> @fruit_pie_the_magician Then you know what you can do? Leave that game and make a new one. :p
[3:58:43] <DonatelloJose> Has Elmo every actually turned the stream off?
[3:58:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> stop with the backflips, please
[3:58:47] <SainVt> like dark souls?
[3:58:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> it hurts
[3:58:51] <+ajcritfumble> im sad law and retribution is gone its a cool challenge mission and i only ever did it like 3 times
[3:58:52] <Shinmaddrox> I despise interception missiosn.
[3:58:55] <$Yakobro> LUL
[3:58:57] <Zbljuv> plague gets enough challenge in his real life
[3:59:03] <+valkuma> ds1 is the easiest souls so... yeah
[3:59:20] <boatzndhoez534> YEY dark souls rants
[3:59:21] <junipxr> aww kitty
[3:59:23] <+Venhammer> we can see elmo
[3:59:23] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Dark souls is overrated on the difficulty...as long as you don't go COD mode on every fucking game you play you'll be fine
[3:59:26] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[3:59:29] <%captainthunderwolf> @Valask Actually, weird random fact, camel spiders usually avoid having to walk by tucking into balls and rolling down sand dunes at around ~15 MPH.
[3:59:33] <%Solidnick18> ?
[3:59:35] <xanerts> but 3 is much easier in every way
[3:59:37] <sunny935> if they want a challenge they could just equip a dragon key of their choosing if they want to ramp up the difficulty for themselves
[3:59:40] <+AngriestAngryArtist> now FUCKING NIOH! OH FUCK THAT SHIT!
[3:59:40] <Zbljuv> play nioh pat
[3:59:45] <Copperage> Souls isn't even that difficult people just blow it up as the hardest thing ever
[3:59:46] <AMajorTom> talk about sword and sheild Plague
[3:59:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Malziel Well that may be, but if my response to seeing a limbo has become "leave immediately" there may be an issue with his kit
[3:59:47] <Shinmaddrox> Demon's is the easiest. You can just Regen your way to victory with nothing to stop you. @valkuma
[3:59:48] <+natural20selfcrit> Yeah 3 is SO much easier
[3:59:49] <Valask> @captainthunderwolf That's a fucking mecha
[3:59:54] <Malziel> @captainthunderwolf Holy crap, that's amazing... and horrifying. *imagines spiderballs coming for me* WutFace
[3:59:57] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Nioh at higher difficulties became stupid unfair
[3:59:57] <+Bupkis7> I enjoy the general gameplay of 3 much more than 1
[4:00:09] <+AngriestAngryArtist> that you have to literally break the shit out of the game on exploits
[4:00:09] <%captainthunderwolf> @Valask That's basically a mecha
[4:00:14] <ThalesMeh> @Valask It's space magic.
[4:00:19] <Sloavon> can't you just stream offline???
[4:00:25] <+mikesniderman> nioh is fun
[4:00:33] <SainVt> i see pat has mastered his wf movement
[4:00:35] <Malziel> @fruit_pie_the_magician It's a simple fix to an issue you're having. If you don't want to deal with a limbo, just go further than the cataclysm aoe. There's a lot you can do, c'mon.
[4:00:36] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:00:39] <%commanderclaw> Nioh is too balls to the wall for me
[4:00:40] <+Thepothero> nioh is super fun
[4:00:42] <Zbljuv> nioh aka better dark souls
[4:00:47] <%captainthunderwolf> @Malziel If it helps, they're technically non-venomous arachnids, not spiders. Their bites CAN pierce muscle tissue though.
[4:00:57] <+fireking900> Hydrate Bot PogChamp
[4:01:02] <SuperSaiyanSora> I loved Nioh!
[4:01:06] <TofuNyan> @AngriestPat Plague: wanna do COOP in nioh? Pat: No I hate that game. Plague: oh.. I hate it too then.
[4:01:08] <%captainthunderwolf> Sea-kittens

[4:01:21] <SwindlerOfProgress> Sea kittens? That's unbelievable.
[4:01:24] <Malziel> @captainthunderwolf My crippling arachnophobia doesn't help, though. zimeLUL
[4:01:25] <applesonthemoon> i mean hes not wrong
[4:01:27] <+Venhammer> PETA is a fucking disgusting organization that kills more animals than it helps
[4:01:28] <%Aitch971> I care about fish because they are delicious
[4:01:36] <Mastigias> I love my fish, but that shit is stupid
[4:01:37] <HypeArbalest> EVEN PLANTS CAN FEEL PAIN! Fish are dumber than planets
[4:01:40] <%captainthunderwolf> Pat has actually said "Fish are barely alive" on multiple occasions, verbatim, multiple times.
[4:01:41] <Sloavon> i'm gonna put a kitten in my mouth now
[4:01:42] <+fireking900> SOMEONE CLIP THAT
[4:01:48] <%captainthunderwolf> Like that's almost a slogan for him.
[4:01:52] <sunny935> pat should go murder sea kittens this run
[4:01:53] <FlameLoneWolf> Granted, I don't like seeing fish tortured like the Japanese do, but yeah, fish are shit.
[4:01:55] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Nioh's great on the normal difficulty beyond that oh god
[4:01:57] <%commanderclaw> PETA can fuck off the edge of my dick, they make actual environmentalist organizations look crazy by association
[4:01:59] <lord_souls> but what about water doggos
[4:02:02] <Valask> Plague hates kittens because he eats fish
[4:02:02] <+WizardofWazz> watchout for the mold spores pat
[4:02:03] <AMajorTom> "check on the laundry" I wonder what that
[4:02:05] <Zbljuv> force pat to play nioh
[4:02:06] <AMajorTom> means
[4:02:08] <Zepik> is "laundry" a euphemism?
[4:02:08] <+AngriestAngryArtist> the chat misinterpreting shit again? of course you guys are doing that
[4:02:09] <+AntithesisEK> water doggos are seals
[4:02:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Malziel Why would I want to go play by myself if i wasin a squad because a Limbo just sprayed liquid boring all over his surroundings?
[4:02:10] <+AngriestAngryArtist> LOL
[4:02:19] <+Venhammer> @commanderclaw Very true
[4:02:26] <$TheNeedlesD> yes
[4:02:28] <Malziel> @fruit_pie_the_magician because you have such a huge issue with him, apparently.
[4:02:33] <SunsetJack> You are fine.
[4:02:36] <+MarshallLee67> pat no

[4:03:03] <+fistorage> lets talk shit about pat before he comes back
[4:03:07] <RevenTheLight> Solo Plague Star. Let's go
[4:03:07] <MMetas> watch him come back to a dead rhino
[4:03:08] <bwong1231> amazing
[4:03:14] <+Cobra743> Paige has a problem
[4:03:16] <Valask> Pat is a kind gentle being
[4:03:17] <MMetas> because infested dropped infront of the door
[4:03:19] <%captainthunderwolf> @Malziel That doesn't help, no. Thankfully all of the really bad spiders exist almost entirely outside of North America, so if you're from one of the good countries you're fine! And you're also fucked otherwise.
[4:03:20] <Everpresent_Overseer> He could had at least Iron skinned
[4:03:21] <bwong1231> Plague should solo plague star
[4:03:25] <flyguy2097> oh, the one thing that can be a problem is if you forget to leave a pug group sometime they will just drag you into missions without saying anything to you
[4:03:35] <Malziel> @captainthunderwolf True that. Also, flamethrowers exist. zimeGrin
[4:03:43] <+CallMeNamelesS> can someone tell me the name of the song
[4:03:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Malziel my opinions regarding limbo are reasonably commonplace

[4:04:17] <%captainthunderwolf> @Malziel And they're called "flammenwerfers" in German, which is hilarious.

[4:06:27] <Zbljuv> wait a minute... you said you dont like the mission structure in nioh but it has the same mission structure as monster world
[4:06:48] <Zbljuv> monster hunter world fuck

[4:06:49] <%captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Like your movies break... all of the time? It happened a ton during Pillars especially.
[4:06:49] <notfinefuqface> is this game open world?
[4:06:54] <%thefishofwar> Hey, can I get an invite to the sub discord apatSkelmoney ?
[4:06:56] <RevenTheLight> Are they grabbing Catalysts?
[4:06:56] <Malziel> @notfinefuqface Nope.
[4:06:57] <IminyourBase> pee pee pat gotta go to the toilet sometime
[4:06:59] <dsauce999> NO PAT NEVER GO PISS!
[4:07:09] <+Ondartyr> @AngriestPat maybe switch to doing the sortie, might be fun to see on stream
[4:07:09] <stigna1> Oh no, I could have taken that chance to go get more water but I sat here like a fool.
[4:07:10] <Malziel> @RevenTheLight I think they're skipping the hemocyte fight
[4:07:10] <+ajcritfumble> nioh doesnt have an oberworld tho just menus
[4:07:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RevenTheLight no, they hate the Hemocyte

[4:07:49] <RevenTheLight> But it's such a cool fight! When I was doing this mission for the first time, someone put 4 and we had to fight 3 bosses. It was great!
[4:07:51] <flyguy2097> in this mission node, and the upcoming venus open world node then yes it is. Otherwise the game is 99% straight corridors
[4:07:55] <+Clemchower> i wouldn't know cuz muted long ago lol

[4:15:56] <TalisKanju> Sick flips
[4:15:57] <+WizardofWazz> you NEED 30
[4:15:58] <stigna1> Fun fact! The infestation is not a zombie virus; its nanites. This is why it infests machines, and why various infested constructs can be remote-controlled.
[4:16:01] <OceanGovernor> @AngriestPat you need 90 actually
[4:16:07] <mcevers> this is WAY easier than mining
[4:16:08] <yodajr99> you WANT 30

[4:16:55] <%TheHypestCripple> I feel like "splorck" is the correct noise for the most kind of horrible diarrhea
[4:16:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RevenTheLight He doesn't want to until he gets Nidus
[4:16:59] <Thesaltymixture> Infestation is basically NANOMACHINES SON!

[4:18:37] <GurrenPrime> now that elmo is 2b approved
[4:18:45] <ThalesMeh> Fun fact! The infestation was created because normal weapons were useless against Sentients. It failed miserably and now we have space zombies in the solar system. Thanks Orokins!

[4:20:03] <Moonlight_Grimoire> okay, people who play Warframe, how bad is the grind for Zephyr Prime?
[4:20:03] <laguerrilha> Been a while i dont play SS13, maybe i am going to download it again
[4:20:07] <+vaporousTippler> SS13 is amazing because it's impossible to play intuitively.
[4:20:14] <+Venhammer> Boatmurdered is great
[4:20:17] <%shin_garbage> That's why it fucking scares me
[4:20:21] <stigna1> That sounds great!

[4:23:50] <HaloScotland> how many hours you got in Warframe now?
[4:23:54] <fazoburquina> Loki is bet fisherman
[4:23:59] <stigna1> So, it had a system where cat would lick temselves to clean. And that transfered stuff to their stomachs. So they added a system where drunk dwarves spilled their drinks and cats got it on their paws, then ingested it. This caused them to instantly die of alcohol poisoning, via vomiting and it took the devs ages to figure out why because its a product of all these natural systems at play.

[4:29:56] <renogaza> mr. warframe guy for dank memes
[4:30:24] <+jestrfestr> did plague get offended by the mention of flux?
[4:30:41] <DoubledOgre> the only good reward is rivens
[4:30:45] <+gozzojt27> HAHAHAH
[4:30:52] <+other_badger> man I really want pat to check out ss13 on the off chance that he doesn't bounce off it completely
[4:30:53] <%drabberfaun535> @AngriestPat you will never get the legendary core
[4:30:54] <EVA_Unit02> Maybe. He is an artist. He needs to have accurate colours Kappa
[4:30:56] <%RevenTheLight> I finished the Music quest today - that was really challenging, but the boss was really fun
[4:30:57] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat i've been doing sorties almost every day since they came out and i have yet to see a legendary core
[4:30:57] <+robertoszek> well, given the color sensitive nature of plague's job flux would mess up with with the color correction
[4:30:58] <GrimHeaper323> i've gotten one legendary core in my 3k hours
[4:31:04] <+Razputin217> Pat will get DESTROYED in a sortie
[4:31:06] <TheSpartanThief> I got one once.
[4:31:07] <Cobaltor_252> my brother got a legendary core on his first sortie
[4:31:13] <%LocoCrazy_> It has like a 0.01% drop chance or something ridiculous
[4:31:15] <fazoburquina> Pineapples
[4:31:20] <+VariantX7> I've gotten it once. never use it. Just sell it to some one who has more platinum than time
[4:31:29] <+gozzojt27> always pineapples
[4:31:31] <ShoddySpice> Damned Amber Stars though
[4:31:32] <%drabberfaun535> LIES
[4:31:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've only gotten 1 legendary fusion core in 2500 hours and I did sorties daily for like two years, my liset has a sculpture pillar thats absurdly large
[4:31:38] <EDFscout> yeah i have one aswell
[4:31:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat join a brand new clan and you'll get like 10k Endo from the Ascension Ceremony
[4:31:41] <pswayde> I got a legendary core on my first sortie
[4:31:44] <anon_1307> I got 2
[4:31:44] <SunsetJack> I never got a shotgun riven nor a legendary core...
[4:31:49] <tierney12> I have had 2 legendary cores over the course of 2000 hours of game time
[4:31:53] <theicebear85> sculptures can be sold once you get to the point you dont need a ton of endo anymore
[4:31:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I sold it for several hundred plat
[4:31:57] <%RevenTheLight> I got 3k Kuva on my first sortie
[4:32:02] <chiglit> never gotten one, been playing since the sortie system was introduced (tho i didnt play everyday obv)
[4:32:04] <stigna1> Watch Pat get it immediately.
[4:32:08] <GurrenPrime> whats kuva used for
[4:32:14] <Brozime> @AngriestPat it has a 0.18% drop chance iirc soo good luck
[4:32:17] <Thesaltymixture> Oh yeah fusion core mods
[4:32:27] <lutefiiisk> If I have Prime video, can I sub for "free" to Pat's channel?
[4:32:28] <+MarshallLee67> @GurrenPrime rerolling rivens mostly, but it's also a requirement for some weapons/frames i think
[4:32:32] <+AcidicHorizon> Plauge is so off
[4:32:33] <%RevenTheLight> @GurrenPrime for some crafting materials and to respec Riven mods
[4:32:35] <+CruelOak> plague is pretty wrong on the old fusioning
[4:32:48] <GurrenPrime> i dont even have any riven mods so i guess thats out of the way for me lol
[4:32:49] <TheSpartanThief> I got a Karak Wraith BP on my first Sortie
[4:32:54] <fazoburquina> the endo system was a blessing
[4:32:55] <+Zeahk> I miss old Fusion Core.
[4:32:56] <Everpresent_Overseer> I want to buy a fusion core just to have it
[4:32:56] <+gozzojt27> i miss old warframe systems though cause ima dinosaur whos been on for 4 years
[4:32:57] <DoubledOgre> kuva is for rolling the riven gacha

[4:33:13] <%drabberfaun535> @AngriestPat you know what this is this is plague doing the same thing pat did to woolie with monster hunter
[4:33:14] <%ssaryn> OOOOOOOOOOO BOI
[4:33:16] <%RevenTheLight> @GurrenPrime from what I understand, it's for late game. The one I got is MR14
[4:33:21] <%ssaryn> ON THAT DRY CUMMIES TRAIN
[4:33:23] <+Rezca> dry cummies?
[4:33:26] <+AcidicHorizon> NO mostly you shoved fusion cores into mods to upgrade them.
[4:33:28] <reonome> OLD MAN'S COUGH
[4:33:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Hell yeah, just unlocked war within
[4:33:32] <stigna1> NOOoooooo....
[4:33:33] <+Twichty> cummies drink mix?
[4:33:36] <HypeArbalest> WHY!
[4:33:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you used to have bronze, silver and gold cores which you could fill up with other lesser mods and then use to enhance mods
[4:33:37] <%ssaryn> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[4:33:40] <+Cobalt_Racer> the baby
[4:33:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it was much worse
[4:33:50] <+Shotgundam009> cummy powder?
[4:33:56] <dsauce999> Hurry Elmo, stop Plague's rants!
[4:33:58] <reonome> HI ELMO
[4:33:58] <thebehatted> hi elmo
[4:33:59] <+LpD9_2> That's how you do Craft Essences in FG:O, fruit_pie
[4:34:01] <KruelDestiny> THE BABY
[4:34:03] <%Solidnick18> elmoooo
[4:34:03] <%ssaryn> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[4:34:04] <Thesaltymixture> They should of made more weapon augment mods instead of rivens
[4:34:05] <Derkinstacker> good
[4:34:05] <%Remery_> ELMO
[4:34:05] <+LpD9_2> It's so stupid and tedious
[4:34:06] <Kratok> Good. Elmo cam is now
[4:34:07] <junipxr> ELMO moon2CUTE
[4:34:08] <%TenderBabyBacon> ONLY ELMO MATTERS
[4:34:10] <fazoburquina> THE BABY
[4:34:14] <+Ondartyr> This is Elmo's stream now
[4:34:21] <ThalesMeh> Fun fact! Tenno slaughtered the Orokin like dogs because child abusing void demons is the worst idea that the orokins ever had (even the fact they created the sentients to terraform new star systems was a better idea that this).
[4:34:21] <+LpD9_2> And I played Warframe in beta, that shit was obnoxious
[4:34:27] <+LpD9_2> In beta, you also had 4 revives DAILY
[4:34:28] <Primary_> you could fuse the same mods together to upgrade them efficiently but you could still combine unrelated mods, a lot less effectively. fusion cores would just upgrade by equal amounts regardless of mod
[4:34:28] <jisang0415> "cyupons"
[4:34:30] <mcevers> NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU PAT ITS ALL ABOUT ELMO
[4:34:31] <EVA_Unit02> Is there a Zephyr blade in Warframe?
[4:34:38] <+LpD9_2> Not per mission, but PER DAY you had 4 revives
[4:34:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> q-pahns
[4:34:53] <+LpD9_2> And mods didn't go past blue in beta. Holy shit it was a very very very basic system
[4:34:55] <RahuStalker> But it’s basically free, pat
[4:34:58] <+ajcritfumble> i wamted the operator gimp suit but im poor :(
[4:35:02] <Shinmaddrox> @LpD9_2 Warframe still claims it is in beta.
[4:35:07] <+d00msdaydan> god thinking about warframe closed beta makes me feel so OLD
[4:35:09] <Renkage098> Now Plague is on 10 different watch lists
[4:35:19] <+ajcritfumble> got my tiberon prime though and as a tiberon slut i already had a god riven
[4:35:19] <KruelDestiny> BibleThump
[4:35:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> So the grineer are awful semihuman clone monsters with massive problems right
[4:35:23] <KingSpunf> Is there any reason to go onto the Plains without taking up a bounty?
[4:35:28] <+d00msdaydan> remember when there was only defense map and defense only ran to like 10 waves?
[4:35:28] <+LpD9_2> If it claims it's in beta, then I don't even wanna know what they called it when I played it the first time
[4:35:30] <$Slimshazbot> How long does it take to get the plague star zaw parts?
[4:35:31] <junipxr> LUL
[4:35:39] <dsauce999> LUL
[4:35:39] <%Solidnick18> apatElmo
[4:35:40] <+d00msdaydan> *only one defense map
[4:35:43] <renogaza> grineer are angry overgrown clone children
[4:35:46] <+LpD9_2> Fucking yes, D00msday
[4:35:49] <+MarshallLee67> if you only get one of each not long @Slimshazbot pat just started today and already got em all
[4:35:49] <+LpD9_2> That was the worst
[4:35:54] <+LpD9_2> because it was also that snow map
[4:35:55] <GodlyLuigi> @KingSpunf if you just want to fish/mine/gather resources without an objective
[4:35:57] <+LpD9_2> That was like two levels
[4:36:02] <vaan_ratsbane> why would one get more than one?
[4:36:11] <TalisKanju> Is this the era of eternal betas?
[4:36:12] <+jestrfestr> @Slimshazbot you can do a run not fighting the boss in like 10 mins which gives you enough rep to buy one part
[4:36:15] <+d00msdaydan> i still miss the gorgon's old firing sound more than anything
[4:36:31] <ThalesMeh> Fun fact! Grineers are clones of a retarded slave that killed a sentient alone.
[4:36:31] <%Remery_> No one puts kitty in a corner!
[4:36:35] <Daxalog> Remove Cato
[4:36:38] <renogaza> !uptime

[4:36:47] <arkv01> elmo
[4:36:50] <theicebear85> Elmo Brand Cat Substitute
[4:36:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I used to care for abused, partially mutilated cats and it filled me with an underlying dislike for people
[4:36:53] <arkv01> elmo's a silent hill mascot
[4:36:55] <KruelDestiny> Elmo is THE BABY
[4:36:57] <+Choceclare> I just got off e of those infested kurobro
[4:36:57] <OceanGovernor> Thank goodness the Orokin make the best decisions
[4:36:59] <EVA_Unit02> Elmo tossed away his Cat essence
[4:37:05] <Renkage098> Have a cat like that.
[4:37:10] <heytakeiteasyterry> Elmo is a stinky cat
[4:37:13] <fazoburquina> Clonemo

[4:37:16] <KingSpunf> Elmo is a Cat Grineer
[4:37:17] <%RevenTheLight> I bet Orokin pooped in secret only.
[4:37:18] <+Shadowthedigger> Elmo rejects his Catmanity.
[4:37:21] <Skeletonmanners> what are pat and plague working towards in this event?
[4:37:21] <KruelDestiny> BibleThump
[4:37:22] <%MisterCrimson> Elmo has rejected his Catmanity
[4:37:22] <%Remery_> Elmo is the class of Dumpster Cat. He has a different build from the normal every day cat.
[4:37:22] <chiglit> What are Elmo's stats anyway
[4:37:25] <+LpD9_2> Elmo is a horror trapped within a Cat-like Body
[4:37:33] <lab990> even cloning him would not mean he would act the same
[4:37:35] <+DeaconBluesClues> GRINEER ELMO

[4:41:16] <+ajcritfumble> sorties are fun defense blows tho
[4:41:26] <+jestrfestr> @AngriestPat bounties on cetus
[4:41:27] <Kratok> @AngriestPat look at the table for Cetus missions
[4:41:28] <+Clemchower> PoE bounty has chance
[4:41:28] <drakthebest> Today’s sortie is really easy
[4:41:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I love defense dorties
[4:41:29] <%Phobaws06> @AngriestPat just trade
[4:41:29] <+Ciphris> get lens from bounties
[4:41:31] <Worldbrand> A different bounty
[4:41:32] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Cetus bounties
[4:41:33] <%ssaryn> LOOK AT BASKET MAN
[4:41:34] <Derkinstacker> From bounties
[4:41:36] <%TenderBabyBacon> what is wrong with plotdumpchild
[4:41:37] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Plains Bounties, Trade, buy for Plat
[4:41:37] <+CruelOak> bounties BOI
[4:41:38] <alpharius88> Bountys in PoE
[4:41:41] <+VariantX7> Zenurik lenses are drops from bounties
[4:41:42] <Daxalog> What the hell is this? What machine is this?
[4:41:45] <+gutlesscoward> it probably is a fetus
[4:41:46] <Jake_the_Bear91> oh spoiler child is just a purple issac clark now
[4:41:48] <Valask> @AngriestPat What difficulty did you play Pillars on? Is Expert mode worth it at all?
[4:41:51] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat buy the greater lenses, much better
[4:41:51] <%RevenTheLight> Ha. Pat's kid looks like a dork.
[4:41:52] <drakthebest> For lens you need to run bounties on cetus. Bounty rewards rotate every couple hours
[4:41:55] <%drabberfaun535> buy them with plat
[4:41:56] <Everpresent_Overseer> @LpD9_2 Thank you just having one for fun, I have a void key from doing the event but I foolishly dissolved all my Ancient Fusion cores
[4:41:57] <+Clemchower> but for trade normal lens costs 10p each
[4:42:02] <+Clemchower> or 5p for normal one
[4:42:03] <+Shadowthedigger> Just do Plains bounties, they rain from the sky as rewards.
[4:42:03] <tierney12> just buy the lens from the market DansGame
[4:42:03] <MajorCrasher> @angriestpat you have to get lucky and get them from bounties or trade for them
[4:42:05] <+unfoldingchoas> trade lens for lens
[4:42:09] <sunny935> before sorties had lenses
[4:42:10] <drakthebest> Or just buy greater lens with your infinite plat
[4:42:13] <TalisKanju> Pat has a kid?!
[4:42:17] <Bailey__gaming> !iptime

[4:42:39] <+jestrfestr> @AngriestPat you can just buy the better versions of lenses with plat in arsenal too
[4:42:41] <SunsetJack> Radiation is awful...
[4:42:41] <Worldbrand> oh
[4:42:42] <dsauce999> wut if your mum ran on batreis? That is a good chat note.
[4:42:43] <%TenderBabyBacon> @TrevyWeaponsGuy and Elmo is the father
[4:42:45] <Worldbrand> PLAGUE'S GONNA KILL PAT
[4:42:51] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Oh no

[4:43:14] <+MarshallLee67> yes
[4:43:15] <OceanGovernor> Radiation means you can shoot friends for buffs Kappa
[4:43:15] <SunsetJack> Yes
[4:43:18] <+Shadowthedigger> Dex Sybaris
[4:43:19] <MMetas> he has a boltor
[4:43:24] <Everpresent_Overseer> @LpD9_2 I have 40P total right now. Need anything for the needed 10P?
[4:43:25] <TheSpartanThief> Crit Soma is fine
[4:43:25] <MMetas> "Imma use the dex sybaris"
[4:43:27] <MMetas> lol
[4:43:29] <Jonesman64> boltor is fun
[4:43:31] <Valask> man the guns look kinda silly being held by these terrifying space robots
[4:43:34] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat anything that isn't a shotgun, bow, or sniper rifle is an assault rifle
[4:43:37] <tierney12> that r7 serration is triggering me
[4:43:45] <+LpD9_2> @Everpresent_Overseer No idea, I haven't played in nearly 7 months, lol.
[4:43:46] <Kratok> Why not make a ~waving arms~ raffle
[4:43:50] <Happyguyelite> Don't get mad at him chat D:
[4:43:50] <renogaza> finally dex sibaris gettin some use
[4:43:59] <%drabberfaun535> 4% orange crit
[4:44:04] <drakthebest> Did he put vital sense on?
[4:44:04] <stigna1> Hit that autoinstall, baby!
[4:44:05] <MMetas> lol
[4:44:08] <+LpD9_2> Barely started back today
[4:44:09] <+unfoldingchoas> a nitain is up
[4:44:10] <%HRDSalami654> Oh god, he's using critical delay.
[4:44:15] <drakthebest> Because crit damage is way more important than crit chance with that little crit
[4:44:17] <%HRDSalami654> Don't do that Pat.
[4:44:19] <Bailey__gaming> upgrading serration is so expensive
[4:44:19] <%ssaryn> Pat why is your Dex Sybaris build so bad Kappa
[4:44:20] <tierney12> critical delay NotLikeThis
[4:44:25] <Everpresent_Overseer> @LpD9_2 Lol I play daily but I been using a ton of platinum to buy the fancy deluxe skins xD
[4:44:28] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat have you completed patient zero? and if so, want to get the parts for mesa?
[4:44:30] <Klefth> Bows are rifles, lol
[4:44:34] <+Shadowthedigger> Oh god the build discussions happening now.
[4:44:35] <ThalesMeh> Fun fact! Captain Vor is immortal and lectures the Tenno everytime he appears. It became a meme because even death cannot stop him from saying the full speech.
[4:44:38] <SunsetJack> Not really...
[4:44:48] <stigna1> @GodlyLuigi He hasn't, and the plan is to do this sortie and go to bed.
[4:44:49] <+Shadowthedigger> firebatHype
[4:44:50] <drakthebest> Pat do you have Vital Sense?
[4:44:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its an ok dex syb build
[4:45:03] <%ssaryn> @AngriestPat Gotta use the kappa man, I saw that shit coming in chat so bad
[4:45:03] <+Saltima> Why aren't you buying dragon mod packs for better mods?
[4:45:11] <drakthebest> Vital Sense is +crit damage and it's incredibly powerful and should be on literally all your weapons
[4:45:11] <tierney12> baro ki'teer OpieOP

[4:45:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but yeah after you hit 100 percent, focusing on crit damage is quite viable
[4:45:29] <GodlyLuigi> @senfood since 3pm est
[4:45:31] <+ajcritfumble> lockers on eris
[4:45:33] <+Saltima> I'm joking
[4:45:36] <+VariantX7> well not exactly drop from hive missions, but you have to find th caches in the hive missions
[4:45:36] <renogaza> pat when you get a chance buy stuff in warframe market, mods will get you a long way
[4:45:38] <+unfoldingchoas> the electricity one, the void trader has it some times
[4:46:02] <gunsrlove> Banshee carry
[4:46:06] <%RevenTheLight> I want to get a Rapier style, but one is RARE. It has like a 1% chance drop
[4:46:07] <%Rawklobstah88> Is he using the Dex Sybaris?
[4:46:09] <Worldbrand> I wanna say it'll still count your mods on sorties with that condition but i honestly would have to google
[4:46:10] <drakthebest> You should have put on Vital sense and hunters munitions, you would be able to one-shot each of these enemies
[4:46:10] <MMetas> lol
[4:46:10] <stigna1> Those status/electric mods also drop from Hive mission caches.
[4:46:12] <Everpresent_Overseer> @LpD9_2 My username is "Mecotha" I can try to find maybe a vaulted thing to add on it
[4:46:12] <TheSpartanThief> "That'll happen"
[4:46:16] <SunsetJack> You need to FORMA your stuff dood.
[4:46:17] <+Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat By having the other 3 people carry you.
[4:46:19] <MMetas> @AngriestPat YOu should have brought the boltor
[4:46:19] <%Phobaws06> Use your 3
[4:46:23] <SunsetJack> You've been neglecting it.
[4:46:26] <Brozime> @AngriestPat You're gonna want to get your Hek to burst tough enemies for awhile
[4:46:26] <+Shadowthedigger> As long as you don't fuck up, you'll be fine.
[4:46:27] <drakthebest> No you could totally have done this but you built it really badly even with the mods you already had
[4:46:28] <KruelDestiny> FeelsGoodMan good friend Plague
[4:46:28] <Jonesman64> plague sempai is so strong
[4:46:30] <%drabberfaun535> no you just need to build your weapons better
[4:46:31] <+AcidicHorizon> Basicly you need to get your mods in order
[4:46:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i like the quake banshee refusing to acknowledge the nerf that destroyed her build
[4:46:39] <renogaza> t
[4:46:46] <+mozartdminor> that's not true
[4:46:47] <TyrantBelial> No it ias.
[4:46:48] <+CruelOak> bullshit you dont
[4:46:51] <drakthebest> You need to use forma to do the higher level sorties
[4:46:54] <+QuadraticGravity> People massively overrate how hard Sorties are.
[4:46:54] <TyrantBelial> You need all 8 slots filled
[4:46:55] <+Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat Absolutely not true.
[4:46:56] <+LpD9_2> @Everpresent_Overseer loading it up, then I'll add you
[4:46:57] <Happyguyelite> Lies I have 1k hours and haven't used forma with no issues
[4:46:57] <MMetas> Forma makes it easier
[4:46:58] <%Rawklobstah88> Hell no, you don't.
[4:46:58] <drakthebest> But not the first two
[4:47:00] <+Boombay1213> You don't need to BUT it'd make in way easier.
[4:47:00] <+Clemchower> you do not need to use forma to do sorties. do sortie and kill in sortie is different
[4:47:02] <+jestrfestr> He's missing MOST mods
[4:47:02] <Brozime> You don't need forma for anything in the game unless you require more speed
[4:47:02] <MMetas> but it's not needed
[4:47:03] <%Nonsubcasual> you need the mods before you need the mods
[4:47:07] <+Ultimatefool> Some weapons, especially melee, don't really need forma at all
[4:47:07] <renogaza> T I G R I S P R I M E
[4:47:08] <Thesaltymixture> Hell no you dont
[4:47:09] <%Nonsubcasual> forma*
[4:47:10] <Everpresent_Overseer> @LpD9_2 Okie dokie
[4:47:11] <TyrantBelial> But you oulda put on more good mods
[4:47:13] <SunsetJack> No, like forma your stuff to make a lot of your weapon decent in Sorti...
[4:47:15] <%Dingus_Tickler> Man, time sure is going slow if 12 minute Tempered Capture Hunts feel like they’re going on forever. Also, this Tempered Uragaan has been giving me new gems every hunt so far PogChamp
[4:47:16] <Derkinstacker> "I'll save it for when i need it" Same problem he has in RPGs
[4:47:18] <ThalesMeh> No
[4:47:23] <+Shadowthedigger> I've forma'd one thing, and I'm fine. It's mostly that you have some shit mods.
[4:47:27] <ThalesMeh> Forma is optional
[4:47:28] <drakthebest> No you totally need it to do the third one, you literally can't damage enemies without forma'd weapons at level 100
[4:47:32] <+Ultimatefool> @AngriestPat You should focus on making your mod ranks maxed out
[4:47:37] <%Rawklobstah88> Forma is entirely optional.
[4:47:42] <Jonesman64> o yeah.. gotta get them corrupted mods.. and nightmare mods
[4:47:42] <tierney12> you shouldn't be using corrupted mods on weapons though OpieOP
[4:47:46] <%Rawklobstah88> It's better to use them, but. Yeah, optional.
[4:47:47] <Brozime> @drakthebest that's strictly untrue
[4:47:47] <%AvoineRa1n> woah pat? still going hard on warframe i see
[4:47:51] <Brozime> and also hilarious
[4:47:56] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @plagueofgripes You're not seeing enemies because of Banshee spamming ultimate
[4:47:59] <MajorCrasher> forma is optional for non sortie content
[4:48:03] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Potatoes are more important than Formas actually... Always potato good things to put more things on things!!
[4:48:09] <%ssaryn> Forma is something you'll always need but if your weapon is good enough, it doesn't matter. You're killing shit.
[4:48:13] <MMetas> THIS SPACE CHILD HAS NO HONOR
[4:48:21] <+Ciphris> i'll useheavy calibur on my opticor if i wanna
[4:48:28] <+CruelOak> @drakthebest you are 100% wrong its actually funny how wrong you are
[4:48:37] <tierney12> 99 forma lato Kappa
[4:48:38] <Bailey__gaming> I just finished Inaros quest, was v hard untill I specced into corrosive
[4:48:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> forma things you like
[4:48:47] <%D_day> Forma your Primes then
[4:48:57] <+Doctor_Scoots> Elemental damage mods are 100% better than base Impact/Slash/Puncture damage currently
[4:48:59] <drakthebest> Okay i'm exxaggerating but needing to empty most of a clip to kill an enemy in a horde shooter more or less equates to dealing literally no damage
[4:48:59] <@BigNaturalMan59> forma elmo
[4:49:00] <+gozzojt27> forma kraken always
[4:49:00] <ShoddySpice> Buy mods and Filled Ayatan Sculptures for Endo
[4:49:02] <drakthebest> You need to be able to one-shot things
[4:49:04] <RowenCleric> is Rhino your favorite so far Pat?
[4:49:09] <laguerrilha> I havent spent 1 forma because i am afraid i will waste it
[4:49:10] <yodajr99> a forma is a terrible thing to waste
[4:49:12] <+VariantX7> forma the weapons you like really, it takes a whole damn day to build one, forma'ing everything is a tremendous waste of time
[4:49:13] <%LocoCrazy_> There's nothing wrong with sitting on your forma pile when you don't fully understand the game.
[4:49:14] <+NickyDynamite> You could definitely forma the rhino prime and that will be valuable
[4:49:15] <+Saltima> @AngriestPat have you chosen your syndicate of choice (steel miridian can get you a "Vaykor Hek" which is more powerful than the vanilla hek as well as they sell mods for the specific weapon)
[4:49:20] <tierney12> need 4 forma warframes for 299% power strength Kappa
[4:49:20] <%Rawklobstah88> "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT HAVE EVERY PRIME WEAPON?!"
[4:49:24] <%ssaryn> Until you actually have mods to do shit, and things to min-max, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT YOU FORMA.
[4:49:25] <%Thraximunday> Yeah save your formas for gear you actually like
[4:49:26] <@Mechz71> @BigNaturalMan59 lmao
[4:49:27] <+Doctor_Scoots> Elemental damage adds all of your IPS damage into additional damage
[4:49:31] <SunsetJack> The D polarity isn't great...
[4:49:32] <+bv728> I have a friend who has a 6 forma MK-1 Braton he uses for Sorties.
[4:49:34] <MMetas> @AngriestPat The truth is play the game enough that you know you game through and through, then you'll know. But you knew that already, you just need time
[4:49:34] <TheSpartanThief> Yeah, exactly. "Forma everything", ok, YOU give me the forma for all these shit-tier weapons then!
[4:49:35] <+CruelOak> @drakthebest i can take many of my no forma weapons and instantly kill any enemys in sortie 3's
[4:49:35] <grayjammer> Plus it’s like, why forma your weapons when your mods are all shit
[4:49:35] <ThalesMeh> @drakthebest There is no need to forma if you have the right mods and frame
[4:49:36] <%Thraximunday> Like the Rubico or the Corinth XD
[4:49:39] <Shinmaddrox> Only ever only Forma something when you don't have the cost to cover a build
[4:49:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> all my rivens end up with D to fuck with me
[4:49:49] <+Ultimatefool> @drakthebest I have an Atlas with no Forma and he can wreck Sortie 3
[4:50:03] <urs0jb> he is complaining about mods for hours now
[4:50:04] <levitheshark> So what does forma do for you? The only thing I'm seeing is it resets your stuff on that item and doesn't help with MR
[4:50:04] <+VariantX7> There should be no D mods for weapons anyway
[4:50:08] <EASrake> yeah
[4:50:09] <+jestrfestr> lol
[4:50:12] <%Nonsubcasual> CC is king
[4:50:13] <TalisKanju> Are they giving you the D?
[4:50:13] <Jonesman64> cold mods houd be made dashes damnit
[4:50:14] <OceanGovernor> banshee experience LUL
[4:50:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you know, why the fuck aren't there any D mods?
[4:50:19] <Primary_> warframes have useless Ds?
[4:50:21] <Jonesman64> should*
[4:50:25] <ShoddySpice> Buy Filled Ayatan Sculptures, you can turn them into Endo.
[4:50:28] <+WizardofWazz> muscle frost
[4:50:30] <+valkuma> I gotta say, Pats Rhino is fucking gorgeous
[4:50:32] <%Rawklobstah88> Yeah. Banshee is silly.
[4:50:32] <+Doctor_Scoots> If your gun deals 100 damage, adding 90% elemental means your gun now deals 190 damage
[4:50:40] <+Ciphris> and people still say banshee was nerfed muhSmug
[4:50:42] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @levitheshark It allows you to change the polarity and make high cost mods cost less
[4:50:46] <GurrenPrime> is banshee any good? i have mine building
[4:50:47] <knomad2b> you guys kinda match
[4:50:48] <MMetas> awww look at him explore
[4:50:53] <+AcidicHorizon> He needs to farm da mods
[4:50:56] <%RevenTheLight> Does today's Sortie have a boss?
[4:51:01] <+gessho> sometimes
[4:51:03] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat rhino prime is super worth formaing
[4:51:07] <%LocoCrazy_> Pat. Spend some plat on that Mesa glyph where she is in the Hitman stance only because I made that.
[4:51:10] <+gozzojt27> rhino hits a pretty hard damage cap tbh
[4:51:17] <+CruelOak> @RevenTheLight no
[4:51:18] <tierney12> @GurrenPrime she's considerable squishy but has some of the best cc or the single strongest damage multiplier in the game
[4:51:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> Sees a sortie boss.. well fuck that then
[4:51:22] <+QuadraticGravity> rhino roar is real good
[4:51:26] <lab990> @AngriestPat you may want to turn off in the options the thing where your operation pops up and makes a comment, for spoiler reasons
[4:51:32] <Thesaltymixture> Pat 0 kills LOL
[4:51:32] <%RevenTheLight> @CruelOak Shame. Level 100 boss battles are fun
[4:51:50] <+CruelOak> @RevenTheLight some are fun some are tedious tbh
[4:51:53] <+AcidicHorizon> just get it to rank 8 for now pat
[4:51:55] <Derkinstacker> after like rank 5 or 6 it gets pretty brutal.
[4:51:56] <%RevenTheLight> fair enough
[4:51:58] <+unfoldingchoas> do the key thing to get him mods like overextend, what its called
[4:52:04] <drakthebest> It's because Serration has no primed equivalent, it's basically the same level as a primed mod
[4:52:06] <sunny935> could just make it 8/10 have had that like that forever and been doing fine
[4:52:11] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @lab990 Pat already said if he covered it during one of his streams it's no longer a spoiler.
[4:52:12] <Brozime> @AngriestPat top level endo farm is 1000+ endo per 3 minutes or so
[4:52:13] <+unfoldingchoas> the blood key missions
[4:52:17] <%commanderclaw> What about sculptures in syndicate mission?
[4:52:21] <drakthebest> The pistol and melee equivalents of serration need primed mods to get to the same level
[4:52:24] <+Saltima> I bet pat gets a riven mod
[4:52:29] <MajorCrasher> doing Sorties every day helps a lot
[4:52:32] <%RevenTheLight> "Sculpture shit" every week? What are they talking about?
[4:52:33] <+gozzojt27> watch him get a godtier riven
[4:52:38] <lab990> @ITHEBURNINATORI oh ok
[4:52:41] <Jonesman64> I'm sitting on endo and sculptures..
[4:52:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> feels like he'll get a riven
[4:52:43] <GurrenPrime> tierney12 good to know i guess, i gotta work on making the other clan frames
[4:52:43] <+gsdakatsuki> @drakthebest incorrect, only melee needs primed pressure point
[4:52:45] <+CruelOak> @RevenTheLight maroo's mission
[4:52:47] <+gsdakatsuki> hornet strike is not primed
[4:52:54] <%RevenTheLight> I never did those lol
[4:53:00] <+CruelOak> i dont either lol
[4:53:01] <Misericordia92> Primed Serration when DE??
[4:53:02] <tierney12> @Brozime is that hieracon?
[4:53:05] <sirsirejay> Wait where do you farm 3000 endo?
[4:53:07] <+CruelOak> i never have had endo issues
[4:53:08] <Twoiis> oh is this his sortie virginity?
[4:53:13] <+AcidicHorizon> Also the physical damage mods are kinda bad pat
[4:53:17] <Brozime> @tierney12 Vodyanoi constructed group
[4:53:33] <EASrake> friendly fire
[4:53:34] <GrimHeaper323> iron skin makes him immune to the procs
[4:53:34] <+AntithesisEK> radiation procs turn you hostile to allies @AngriestPat
[4:53:37] <SunsetJack> Radiation Hazard means there are environmental hazard that would proc radiation.

[4:53:51] <+TheGodfrey> Plague you suck at explaining
[4:53:54] <GurrenPrime> wasnt radiation different?

[4:54:11] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Plague DOES suck at explaining sometimes
[4:54:12] <theicebear85> team kill in 3, 2, 1.....
[4:54:13] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @reventhelight Doing the softies usually gives Ayatan sculptures which you can throw the cyan stars into to make them more valuable when you trade them into Maroo at her bazaar on Earth.
[4:54:14] <+Ciphris> why is plague so fucking obtuse
[4:54:18] <BakaSurvivah> l9l the ash memes good timez
[4:54:22] <dsauce999> When Plague talks like this, he sounds like an oblivion NPC
[4:54:23] <Shinmaddrox> honestly it's pretty easy to follow
[4:54:30] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Sorties*
[4:54:37] <+AntithesisEK> this is why you bring Inaros so you're immune to radiation and can throw sand at your friends Kappa
[4:54:37] <Brozime> @AngriestPat Hek is > god

[4:57:25] <Brozime> @AngriestPat I love teaching so if you want to know anything just shoot me a PM on Discord
[4:57:26] <drakthebest> Pat can you do a Lua spy mission after this?

[4:58:09] <%Nonsubcasual> pet 2.0 on the way
[4:58:17] <+mozartdminor> primed regen?
[4:58:22] <theicebear85> primed regen
[4:58:23] <ShoddySpice> Primed Regen though
[4:58:25] <Spydurman> man I don't even play warframe and I knew Plague was talking bullshit. Pat should just ignore his advice
[4:58:28] <+itsthatasianboy> primed regen tho
[4:58:30] <+gozzojt27> yeet, new pet system coming in 2 years probably
[4:58:34] <mcevers> primed regen
[4:58:37] <TheSpartanThief> Well, there is Pets 2.0 happening "Soon"
[4:58:42] <mcevers> ITSTRADEOFF VERSUS A PET
[4:58:45] <bendatron> !uptime
[4:58:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 58m 54s.
[4:58:48] <GrimHeaper323> PRIMED REGEN
[4:58:50] <mcevers> you can res pets, you can't res sentinels
[4:58:50] <cizal11> primed regen is 3 revives
[4:58:51] <ShoddySpice> It regens 3 times
[4:58:51] <GrimHeaper323> is 3 times
[4:58:55] <%machshop> a surprise to be sure
[4:58:56] <TyrantBelial> Primed Regwen makes it regen 5 times.
[4:58:57] <zamzoph> PJSalt
[4:58:58] <Jonesman64> I bet its a bug they'll "fix" in Pet 2.0
[4:59:00] <mcevers> PRIMED REGEN SI 3 TIMES
[4:59:00] <cizal11> but it is still a bandaid for a stupid system
[4:59:03] <Thesaltymixture> @Brozime Hope your feeling better. Looking forward to more videos
[4:59:07] <+Ciphris> god damn it plague
[4:59:09] <vaan_ratsbane> primed regen is 6 gorillion times
[4:59:10] <+unfoldingchoas> there a mod that revives them, i only use it for vacuum mod, if only warframes just auto do what vacumm does
[4:59:11] <MajorCrasher> primed regen is a bandaid but totally worth it
[4:59:11] <ThalesMeh> Do it solo
[4:59:14] <+Ciphris> stop feeding misinformation
[4:59:17] <Twoiis> unimpossible.
[4:59:17] <%ssaryn> Warframe has a weird system that no one can understand? Put a bandaid mod in there Kappa
[4:59:19] <stigna1> The usual regen is 3 times, primed is five. But yeah, plague is SUPER right.
[4:59:20] <+gozzojt27> warframe has alot of bandaids though, its fine
[4:59:21] <Renkage098> And god help you if your companion happens to be Kubrow. Apparently dying pisses off doggos
[4:59:22] <+VariantX7> but yeah it is a band-aid. I woudl rather it just take some of my resources to regen my sentinel
[4:59:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> thing is, if your sentinal dies once its probably going to instantly die again within a few seconds

[5:05:31] <dsauce999> Welome in Sortie Pat!
[5:05:31] <+NickyDynamite> You're probably not supposed to be there yet
[5:05:33] <cizal11> wow what an AMAZING login bonus
[5:05:34] <Brozime> @AntithesisEK ye
[5:05:40] <MajorCrasher> Kuva is garbage
[5:05:46] <Rivalshotzgp> Just use a elemental proc weapon like the Supra and debuff for the team
[5:05:55] <tierney12> i can't wait for @Brozime to correct everything plague says Kappa
[5:06:04] <+gozzojt27> unveiled rivens make me squirm soo much, like it could be anything
[5:06:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> your challenge was to shoot far away people, it would take like 10 minutes
[5:06:07] <+AntithesisEK> like 60,000 EHP versus the average frame's... 5000 ehp
[5:06:08] <+VariantX7> lucky thats an easy one
[5:06:09] <Jonesman64> throw the mod into a thing.. and do the thing
[5:06:10] <+gozzojt27> DO IT
[5:06:11] <%Rawklobstah88> Sybaris is a good weapon for that.
[5:06:17] <GrimHeaper323> this'll be rough
[5:06:24] <chiglit> gonna be hard without a scope
[5:06:29] <+QuadraticGravity> Go to Plains
[5:06:31] <Brozime> A number of things Plague has said are mostly correct @tierney12
[5:06:32] <SunsetJack> You can WP an enemy to get an idea for the distance.
[5:06:34] <+AntithesisEK> use your marker?
[5:06:39] <cizal11> just go to the plains yeah
[5:06:40] <ShoddySpice> Mark the enemies with a waypoint
[5:06:44] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Some tiles are so damn big that the waypoints don't know what to do.... Eventually you will learn some of those tiles and learn to navigate it without looking at the bad waypoint and then pass the bad tile
[5:06:44] <MajorCrasher> Equip the riven
[5:06:48] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat place a marker on the enemy to see the distance
[5:06:49] <+Clemchower> you mark using g key on enemy and go away
[5:06:50] <+d00msdaydan> JUST GO TO PLAINS
[5:06:51] <+Nthenorm> just go to the plains
[5:06:52] <Copperage> holy shit just do it on the plains
[5:06:52] <Kratok> Just do it far
[5:06:52] <+Ciphris> jesus plague it's just easier on the plains god
[5:06:53] <OceanGovernor> Yeah just mark the enemy
[5:06:53] <Worldbrand> the majority of tiles is less than 80m across, so you might want to go to the plains
[5:06:54] <MajorCrasher> Waypoint
[5:06:57] <+Venhammer> some snipers show how far an enemy is
[5:06:57] <+jestrfestr> can use custom waypoints to see distance
[5:06:58] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Protip; you can set a waypoint on an enemy to track how far away something is.
[5:06:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i've gotten some truly fucked riven challenges, like "capture a simaris target without using powers or being detected with a hobbled key equipped"
[5:07:01] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @plagueofgripes You can put a marker on enemies
[5:07:04] <RahuStalker> Just go to plains
[5:07:06] <+Saltima> just shoot enemies really far away
[5:07:08] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> 50 warframes away
[5:07:09] <%Brighthawk> How can this be apatWhat
[5:07:12] <+geobuster> you can measure distance by placing a way point and reading the meter count
[5:07:14] <Jonesman64> Just PUT a marker on the Enemies!
[5:07:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> oh yeah or traps
[5:07:22] <Laecerelius> Most Riven challenges seem to be made for the plains
[5:07:26] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @plagueofgripes marker will tell him the distance
[5:07:28] <Fat_Gaz> jesus his help is getting way worse as the stream goes on
[5:07:31] <EASrake> its an exciting new thing?
[5:07:33] <cizal11> @fruit_pie_the_magician my first one was to do a level 30+ elimination mission undetected alone
[5:07:37] <tierney12> @Brozime i thought they were about to do builds, and almost nobody knows how to make optimum builds, i have 3000 hours and i don't know how to build]
[5:07:37] <cizal11> it sucked

[5:07:54] <Copperage> not even wrong LUL
[5:07:54] <%Nonsubcasual> mark
[5:07:54] <TropicalPsychosis> riven mods are dog aids

[5:08:13] <+AntithesisEK> the digital manifestation of the Gods of old mocking your fate
[5:08:15] <+zork990> the idea behind them is ok, but the execution was terrible
[5:08:16] <+gessho> Just freeze time with the bullets in front of them and run
[5:08:17] <+AcidicHorizon> use waypoint to measure
[5:08:17] <chiglit> isnt the spawn range like ~150m
[5:08:17] <DoubledOgre> wtb god soma riven 20p Kappa
[5:08:18] <+AntithesisEK> and also charging you interest
[5:08:19] <drakthebest> Riven mods are special lootbox-ish mods for specific weapons that can be either incredibly useless or game-breakingly powerful
[5:08:21] <FadingEmber> @AngriestPat mark a enemy then run away
[5:08:22] <stigna1> I...I really like rivens...
[5:08:27] <MajorCrasher> @angriestpat use a waypoint
[5:08:32] <MajorCrasher> left dpad
[5:08:36] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @mark the enemies with up on dad it'll tell you the distance
[5:08:38] <+gozzojt27> i dont think plague has been wrong but im old, its probably infuriating to new people
[5:08:39] <+jestrfestr> @AngriestPat it will pop up like an achievement with your progress
[5:08:47] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Grineer hang out in camps at night, your waypoint can give you range-readings.
[5:08:54] <tierney12> @AngriestPat use the vectis for a rangefinder
[5:08:54] <sunny935> wouldnt archwing sorta help with the distance?
[5:08:54] <cizal11> oh geez
[5:08:56] <+LemonyShift> Dosent the scanner show range
[5:08:57] <bendatron> pat just get a sniper
[5:09:04] <Brozime> @AngriestPat they're obfuscated slot machines/lootbox mods you can sell for thousands of platinum to suckers. I don't interact with the trading of them as it's the worst thing in Warframe to support imo.
[5:09:05] <Derkinstacker> UP on D-pad
[5:09:07] <+Venhammer> you should really be using a scoped sniper for this
[5:09:08] <stigna1> @bendatron He does not have a sniper.
[5:09:09] <ITHEBURNINATORI> @angriestpat up on dpad
[5:09:14] <MajorCrasher> you csn mark from any range pat
[5:09:14] <ThalesMeh> Please don't try to headshot a infested
[5:09:17] <+LemonyShift> archwing?
[5:09:26] <+Pnutz_> Doing this challenge with the dex sybaris is like shooting pixels
[5:09:26] <ThalesMeh> just go hunt balistas
[5:09:29] <+AntithesisEK> LUL I think that said 95m
[5:09:31] <Shinmaddrox> The head on a Infested it kind of hard to hit
[5:09:31] <MettleWolf> Trying to headshot with a BURST RIFLE
[5:09:37] <+AcidicHorizon> hunt graneer
[5:09:38] <GodlyLuigi> jesus i wish pat would ask the actual discord for help
[5:09:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i mean seriously, "capture a simaris target without using traps or abilities or being detected with a hobbled key equipped?" i mean ffs, the simaris target detects you, I ended up having somebody else do it while I hid
[5:09:41] <ITHEBURNINATORI> infested are the worst to headshot
[5:09:41] <ShoddySpice> Infested Heads are dumb do it to Grineer
[5:09:44] <chiglit> Kappa
[5:09:45] <Kratok> Ohh right, headshots are probably possible
[5:09:46] <+Pnutz_> I know this first hand
[5:09:49] <+fireking900> 100 meter headshots
[5:09:51] <RahuStalker> Try grineer
[5:09:51] <+jestrfestr> shoot anything but infested they have stupid head lol
[5:09:52] <renogaza> trying to headshot with ironsights
[5:09:54] <tierney12> what pat is trying to do is nearly impossib;e
[5:09:58] <bendatron> @stigna1 i know that, im saying he should go get one
[5:10:00] <SunsetJack> IT has to be a headshot no?
[5:10:03] <cizal11> LMAO oh boy
[5:10:08] <sayaman012341> Does he not have a sniper rifle?
[5:10:09] <+gozzojt27> @AngriestPat look for grineer in camps to headshot. its much easier
[5:10:12] <+Pnutz_> It has to be a headshot yes
[5:10:13] <TropicalPsychosis> headshot at 100 meters with dex sybaris is a fucking breeze
[5:10:13] <GodlyLuigi> nope
[5:10:14] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Shouldnt he be trying to use a vex or something?
[5:10:15] <bbjohnny1> let plague spawn an archwing for you
[5:10:15] <+FragmentNation> find a camp
[5:10:16] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> A sniper?
[5:10:20] <TropicalPsychosis> it might be harder on a controller though
[5:10:22] <+MarshallLee67> he doesn't have a sniper
[5:10:23] <+AntithesisEK> plague is a baaaad guardian angel
[5:10:23] <Worldbrand> Does pat have the snipetron or did he already sell it?
[5:10:25] <+OranHexthief> i thought he said he had a snipetron though
[5:10:33] <+timblenaut> HE GOT ONE
[5:10:33] <Shinmaddrox> It has to be headshots from 100m away. Which is kind of bullshit with infested
[5:10:37] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Shooting from an Archwing with elevation may help shoot over cover.
[5:10:47] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Grineer hang out in camps at night.
[5:10:58] <renogaza> try archwing sniping
[5:10:58] <cizal11> jump straight up
[5:11:01] <+Pnutz_> Infested are honestly annoying af on the plains
[5:11:02] <+Rezca> this actually seems like a fun challenge
[5:11:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> archwing would make it much easier
[5:11:12] <Zanpa> NotLikeThis
[5:11:18] <+WizardofWazz> 99m
[5:11:18] <tierney12> remember pat is using a controller
[5:11:19] <renogaza> archwing sniping lol
[5:11:23] <GrimHeaper323> Broken my ass
[5:11:23] <Jonesman64> thats why you stealth snipe this
[5:11:24] <Zanpa> 99m NotLikeThis
[5:11:24] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat tell plague to drop you an archwing
[5:11:30] <stigna1> @AngriestPat Consider elevating yourself over hills with archwing.
[5:11:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> at least there aren't any failure conditions
[5:11:31] <ravencloak13> Has Pat done fishing yet?
[5:11:32] <+AcidicHorizon> you walked forward
[5:11:37] <GrimHeaper323> thats why ya bring a sniper rifle
[5:11:40] <+jestrfestr> sybaris is burst fire the bullets spread
[5:11:41] <+gozzojt27> yaaa let him archwing snipe
[5:11:43] <Worldbrand> nice
[5:11:44] <+AntithesisEK> oh thank god it's only 8
[5:11:51] <+Esasaatana> jesus pat your friend is insufferable
[5:11:53] <+Razputin217> you need a sniper rifle mate
[5:11:53] <renogaza> nice shot
[5:11:56] <K_ross> Should built a sniper LUL
[5:11:56] <+MarshallLee67> i had this challenge yesterday but the enemies had to be unalerted
[5:11:59] <%Gogogolem> I thought pat had a sniper tron?
[5:12:00] <+MarshallLee67> such a pain in the ass with all the infested
[5:12:02] <bendatron> in theory couldnt plague gift pat a sniper and then pat give it badk
[5:12:07] <Renkage098> This isn't HARD. But it is tedious. Hard and tedious are 2 different things
[5:12:08] <ravencloak13> Also I wish the fishing spear was a real weapon I can mod to hell and back.
[5:12:09] <+Pnutz_> From what I can tell your going to want a sniper eventually anyways for Sorties
[5:12:09] <MettleWolf> Certainly no MW2 sniper mission
[5:12:10] <tierney12> last time i did this it was 18 headshots
[5:12:11] <K_ross> Should have*
[5:12:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> also you have a shitty sniper rifle which you should use

[5:14:19] <+QuadraticGravity> @MidnightCrow Yes
[5:14:24] <tierney12> @Kenori it absolutely is
[5:14:24] <%CasualCoreK> the trouble is that Plague turns to sarcasm are vagueness REALLY fast

[5:14:31] <Kratok> @Kenori no it's just a timed grind

[5:17:51] <Zanpa> using a controller doesn't help
[5:17:52] <+WizardofWazz> YES
[5:17:53] <Twoiis> One of the easier ones.
[5:17:53] <MettleWolf> Give him wings so that he may fly sayeth the Lord
[5:17:54] <sayaman012341> yep

[5:18:01] <+mozartdminor> No, I've had easier - but it's not bad
[5:18:06] <Everpresent_Overseer> This is the warframe content we deserve
[5:18:06] <cizal11> there's no fail condition this is super easy
[5:18:07] <+Cobalt_Racer> don't be upsetti, pat, have some spaghetti
[5:18:07] <+QuadraticGravity> He's not wrong, this is a really easy one
[5:18:09] <+Rezca> it actually is quite an easy challenge though
[5:18:10] <GrimHeaper323> if only there was some kind of warframe ability that could make enemies stand still
[5:18:10] <JimJamr> Just go to the top of a mountain in the area
[5:18:10] <ShoddySpice> Easiest is slide melee kills
[5:18:17] <+VariantX7> its one of hte easiest. You don't even have to fulfill the condition in one go
[5:18:18] <cizal11> they're dead pat
[5:18:18] <Twoiis> I had to slow drift in the air while doing head shots while holding a dragon key that reduced my damage.
[5:18:20] <+WizardofWazz> what is this fallout nv?
[5:18:23] <$sassyquatch963> @AngriestPat try using a mouse

[5:19:31] <+gozzojt27> man this is nearing shadow puzzle levels, lol
[5:19:34] <+jestrfestr> that enemy has alot of armor
[5:19:35] <urs0jb> plague should use a frame with cc to help, not loki u.u
[5:19:35] <ravencloak13> It’s cause your hitting a Bombadir and they have stupid high armor.
[5:19:44] <cizal11> you're hitting the back pat
[5:19:45] <Dath123> Aim for their feet for a better range, you're reading the background behind them.
[5:19:46] <ravencloak13> And a “fuck you” grenade launcher.
[5:19:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> also give him that archwing so cover isn't as much of a pain in the ass
[5:19:50] <Shaikan_ITA> @Timesteel got it from today's sortie, fun times
[5:19:51] <Lysdexic9541> The easiest Riven I ever got was kill 100 enemies when sliding
[5:19:53] <+Rezca> worst is Defense, protetction target takes no damage, Solo,
[5:19:54] <+QuadraticGravity> Bombards have stupid armor and you're shooting him in the back
[5:19:54] <sayaman012341> watching this hurts
[5:19:56] <+Raidou24> Can't plague play Harrow, use his 1 while Pat snipes?
[5:20:07] <Misericordia92> ofc pat aims at the bombard of all the enemy type
[5:20:07] <ThalesMeh> Yes
[5:20:09] <+WizardofWazz> Go Pat Go
[5:20:10] <+Shadowthedigger> God this is just amazing.
[5:20:11] <sunriser696> did pat zoomed in the rifle?
[5:20:11] <Worldbrand> I guess you can roar to buff your damage?
[5:20:13] <Kenori> this seems liek the literal fucking worst
[5:20:13] <MajorCrasher> put more damage on your sniper
[5:20:18] <sunriser696> also fuck doing sniper with a controller
[5:20:19] <ThalesMeh> Plague could also give him a archwing charge
[5:20:19] <Malziel> That would mean plague would have to be useful Kappa
[5:20:20] <Kratok> @Raidou24 and be pleasant?
[5:20:22] <%Gogogolem> This is the most entertaining stream by far.
[5:20:23] <RahuStalker> Someone tell him he can extra zoom
[5:20:30] <$sassyquatch963> @Kenori this is easy, pat's just bad
[5:20:30] <+Cobalt_Racer> Canadian man doesn't realize that he has a variable magnification scope by using altfire
[5:20:31] <+Shadowthedigger> At least he doesn't have to find and then kill Plains critters with a fishing spear.
[5:20:31] <stigna1> @MajorCrasher He really can't tho. And he's max zoomed in.
[5:20:35] <Kerozero> Can't plague just play trinity and 2 enemies so they can't move ?
[5:20:59] <MajorCrasher> is that sniper potatoed tho?
[5:21:02] <GrimHeaper323> plague could do a lotta things
[5:21:03] <+QuadraticGravity> Arctic = Arson
[5:21:05] <drakthebest> Pat is at max magnification
[5:21:06] <RahuStalker> Pat you can alter zoom with secondary fire
[5:21:07] <Malziel> @MajorCrasher doesn't seem like it
[5:21:10] <SunsetJack> Don't abort tho.
[5:21:21] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> The Arctic, well known for it's overbearing heat
[5:21:22] <%RevenTheLight> "Aw. What's hitting me?"
[5:21:25] <+WizardofWazz> "I need to call my bai"
[5:21:28] <Zanpa> he is zoomed in guys
[5:21:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> enemy responses to being shot in the head from really faraway seems to be mild confusion
[5:21:52] <Malziel> Yeah, it's fucking weird how "back of the head" headshots sometimes just don't count. NotLikeThis
[5:21:54] <MettleWolf> Back up boi
[5:22:03] <BaronVonWolfe> You're doing it!
[5:22:03] <+WizardofWazz> its going to be a trash riven
[5:22:16] <%MultipleJiggs> I think back of the head shots on grineer need a bit of punchthrough to count
[5:22:18] <Misericordia92> 1 more
[5:22:19] <NobodyyX> Buff yourself for the tankier boys.
[5:22:28] <+geobuster> Grineer armor makes it near impossible to headshot an enemy that is looking away from you
[5:22:29] <+Ciphris> @Malziel probably because grineer units have like a backside that go above their heads
[5:22:36] <GrimHeaper323> DONE
[5:22:36] <+gozzojt27> yeet
[5:22:38] <Zanpa> 97m
[5:22:43] <ShoddySpice> 97m
[5:22:44] <+MarshallLee67> nope

[5:22:52] <applesonthemoon> 95 m
[5:22:56] <applesonthemoon> why wont it work!?!
[5:23:06] <stigna1> See? Easy!
[5:23:11] <Quibbis> How can this be?
[5:23:17] <Zanpa> no it's just your reticle moving from behind them to them
[5:23:18] <+WizardofWazz> Nani?
[5:23:20] <+jestrfestr> open menu to check @AngriestPat
[5:23:25] <Kerozero> He has the PERFECT weapon for this riven and he's still fuckin up by not looking slightly left
[5:23:25] <+jestrfestr> and close
[5:23:35] <ravencloak13> You are literally shooting wamp rats basically.
[5:23:42] <+QuadraticGravity> Plague "Please be mad at me" Gripes
[5:23:42] <Malziel> AYYY
[5:23:43] <+jestrfestr> nvm
[5:23:44] <GrimHeaper323> THERE WE GO
[5:23:45] <sayaman012341> obvious lies by pat
[5:23:45] <+MarshallLee67> ayyy
[5:23:45] <tierney12> HE DID IT
[5:23:45] <Misericordia92> Opticor riven pls
[5:23:48] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> oof
[5:23:51] <Worldbrand> It's more that a low rank snipetron's just kinda bad as far as sniper rifles go
[5:23:52] <+gozzojt27> now WATCHU GET?
[5:23:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> wooo
[5:23:53] <ravencloak13> Also, hunt the little critters for easier game head shots.
[5:23:56] <ThalesMeh> Because they are wearing heavy armor
[5:23:56] <KruelDestiny> FeelsGoodMan Clap
[5:23:58] <Malziel> You can abort, it'll be fine
[5:23:59] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> OOF
[5:23:59] <MettleWolf> He...did it
[5:24:00] <%TenderBabyBacon> So big and strong
[5:24:02] <+fireking900> YOU ... DID IT
[5:24:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> weird it didn't work a second ago
[5:24:02] <Zanpa> so close NotLikeThis
[5:24:02] <%Nonsubcasual> you can abort actually
[5:24:04] <+Spenzor> aborting is actually fine
[5:24:04] <drakthebest> Doesn't matter aborting doesn't reduce stacks
[5:24:05] <%Phobaws06> Abort works too
[5:24:05] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat you can abort you'll keep your progress
[5:24:06] <+Clemchower> you can esc cancel mission too
[5:24:06] <+UncleCracks> It still works if you abort
[5:24:06] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You can safely abort he is wrong
[5:24:06] <Malziel> No, progress carries over even if you abort
[5:24:07] <chiglit> you can abort
[5:24:07] <Rivalshotzgp> Supra best riven
[5:24:09] <chiglit> once its open
[5:24:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> also yeah you can abort
[5:24:10] <stigna1> @AngriestPat You are already a big success! You can press ESC to see how big your number has grown!
[5:24:10] <%Nonsubcasual> progress even saves between missions
[5:24:12] <+Clemchower> it works
[5:24:12] <+AcidicHorizon> You can abort
[5:24:12] <%RevenTheLight> "Aw. Aw. Aw. Oh, I'm dead"
[5:24:12] <TyrantBelial> It doesn't.
[5:24:18] <sunny935> aborting still keeps it
[5:24:23] <Worldbrand> You can, but I understand erring on the side of caution
[5:24:27] <tierney12> all what riven pat will get Kappa
[5:24:30] <tierney12> *call
[5:24:34] <+geobuster> aborting doesn't erase riven progress
[5:24:37] <Malziel> Lanka Riven zimeGrin
[5:24:38] <stigna1> You can actually abort rivens; they store internally. But mission objectives get lost.

[5:28:04] <+Saltima> @AngriestPat just dissolve it. and piss everyone off. the real plague way
[5:28:07] <Brozime> @AngriestPat it's a slot machine you roll by using tons of time and is an obfuscated lootbox type scenario for DE. I dislike them immensely for being anti-player.
[5:28:11] <Haru568> pat don't close game
[5:28:14] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Chat screaming at Pat about doing nothing because he doesn't know what anything means
[5:28:14] <dsauce999> Are you not dumb animals?
[5:28:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Pat, don't not breathe
[5:28:19] <AdmiralPrawn> I haven't played Warframe since Second Dream, what's changed since then?
[5:28:27] <%finaltrinity5> Pat don't breate
[5:28:29] <Haru568> don't alt f4
[5:28:39] <+Clemchower> doing weekely ayatan mission and sortie everyday kinda gets you fair amount of endo.
[5:28:43] <+crimsonberry255> Patt! Farm mastery by using new weapons! Just using the Hek gets you no mastery!
[5:28:45] <drakthebest> He's totally right
[5:28:49] <+Spenzor> Yea, Brozime is pretty much right
[5:28:49] <ravencloak13> @admiralprawn Well, beginning of the game has become a bit more friendly.
[5:28:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Also, you can reroll it cheap for 5 or 6 times, and you can keep the original stats if you want
[5:29:01] <+unfoldingchoas> @spenzor yeah
[5:29:05] <+zork990> they should have made rivens utility, but you can get damage on them, so people just get god roll rivens
[5:29:11] <ITHEBURNINATORI> Fuck I had never thought of it that way but it's true
[5:29:14] <+WizardofWazz> CLEM
[5:29:17] <stigna1> I think they are good! They provide endgame players to actually work towards, instead of immediately getting the thing.
[5:29:19] <AdmiralPrawn> Has Vor been demoted to the rank of midshipman yet?
[5:29:22] <+AntithesisEK> rivens are so sinister
[5:29:24] <%Rawklobstah88> See, I don't mind it, because it doesn't actually cost money. Nothing about Riven mods cost money, just time.
[5:29:35] <+Clemchower> it caps at 3500
[5:29:36] <+gozzojt27> they cap at 3500 though
[5:29:38] <%Rawklobstah88> Unless you're trading, but even then.
[5:29:40] <Worldbrand> The reason they don't want you to lock stats is because it's not intended to be a progression system-- that would very quickly make it one. It's gambling, and they don't have to balance them because it's gambling.
[5:29:40] <ravencloak13> @admiralprawn They have relay bosses now that give you some starting weapons, gear and stuff.
[5:29:41] <Kenori> cant you spend money to reduce time?
[5:29:43] <smittenByAntsInPants> well u can always keep the old one if u dont like the reroll
[5:29:45] <TyrantBelial> yeah but you can trade for good rivens so you're basically buying them
[5:29:47] <+Nephthyz> @AngriestPat It's not so bad, because you can reroll but then choose to stick with the stats you had before rerolling if the stats suck.
[5:29:50] <TyrantBelial> no such thing as shortcuts just detours
[5:29:52] <+hoenhime344> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WARFRAMEEE
[5:29:53] <%Rawklobstah88> No, Kenoir
[5:29:54] <feuddude> @Ragnarok1776 Yeah, you can't even buy kuva for real money, and all the good rivens are too expensive to buy with real money. how is it a slot machine?
[5:29:56] <%Rawklobstah88> Kenori
[5:29:56] <%RevenTheLight> Oh, I missed it, what did he get for the sortie? Was it this Riven mod?
[5:29:58] <Malziel> The money comes from player trading for plat
[5:29:59] <+AntithesisEK> it's anti-player because you have no direct control
[5:29:59] <Kenori> weird
[5:29:59] <ThalesMeh> Open trade chat
[5:30:02] <renogaza> rivens are not sinister wtf, rivens dont cost anything and dont harm anyone
[5:30:04] <Kerozero> You sell it to other player
[5:30:07] <+Clemchower> it has too much random number generation involved
[5:30:10] <%LunarSilence> @AngriestPat I've seen some rivens go for 4K+ plat
[5:30:12] <Copperage> @AngriestPat the plat prices of good rivens are tremendous
[5:30:14] <Brozime> @AngriestPat they sell for thousands of platinum and you have almost 0 chance of getting a good Riven for what you actually want
[5:30:15] <SunsetJack> When you roll your riven, you can pick your previous roll or new roll before finalizing your roll.
[5:30:15] <MajorCrasher> people buy rivens for a lot of plat
[5:30:15] <+AntithesisEK> you don't craft a riven, it just randomly drops. you don't choose a riven, it just randomly happens
[5:30:26] <gerahwar> yay opticors
[5:30:29] <Cyphereous> @AngriestPat You can trade them so people sell them for oodles of plat and it encourages people to mindlessly farm the best possible Riven. Encourages excessive spending
[5:30:29] <drakthebest> You don't have enough plat to buy the highest tier plats
[5:30:35] <%D_day> Back Alley Rivin Dealers monkaS
[5:30:35] <KruelDestiny> oof
[5:30:36] <drakthebest> And you have infinite plat
[5:30:38] <renogaza> pretty sure pat doesnt need plat
[5:30:45] <+gozzojt27> yes, thats exactly what i do
[5:30:46] <drakthebest> *Highest tier rivens
[5:30:50] <Malziel> You can only get one riven a day, MAYBE
[5:30:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Brozime doesn't like rivens because of all the levels of random chance
[5:30:54] <+AntithesisEK> in practice that doesn't work
[5:30:55] <MajorCrasher> You can but it's also randoml
[5:30:56] <ravencloak13> @admiralprawn Also the Plains of Eidolon which is just a massive field that you can use your Archwing in once you build an archwing drop thing.
[5:30:58] <urs0jb> most rivens won't cost that
[5:31:00] <Worldbrand> In theory! but people like big numbers
[5:31:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> that being saif I love rivens
[5:31:08] <Malziel> In theory, yes. In practice, the best weapons can get god rivens because DE doesn't update the riven system often
[5:31:09] <+Ciphris> @AngriestPat pat didn't you just talk about players in online games being selfish and impatient
[5:31:09] <gerahwar> In theory yes. in practice, it is quiestionable
[5:31:18] <%Rawklobstah88> Man, I use a Riven for a Grinlok. Because fuck the meta.
[5:31:18] <ravencloak13> @antithesisek Tell that to MMO players.
[5:31:19] <Malziel> Bad weapons stay bad, good weapons become AMZING
[5:31:19] <d3adlyfr0g> rawr
[5:31:21] <+Clemchower> LUL
[5:31:22] <+jestrfestr> it IS
[5:31:24] <Malziel> Yes, it's fucking cancer
[5:31:24] <+jestrfestr> really is
[5:31:24] <+Nephthyz> I don't use my rivens for shit weapons because I do not ever want to touch them to begin with.
[5:31:28] <Kerozero> This is for the true endgame
[5:31:30] <MajorCrasher> Everyone chases it
[5:31:33] <Brozime> @AngriestPat that's what I do and also Rivens don't make the bad weapons actually better. I avoid interacting/supporting the Riven trade economy in any way because I hate it.
[5:31:34] <KruelDestiny> Agreed
[5:31:36] <Malziel> Not even endgame, just fucking disgusting.
[5:31:37] <$Yakobro> GRAKATA
[5:31:38] <applesonthemoon> chase the purple dragon!
[5:31:40] <Copperage> its actually a unicorn hunt trying to find the perfect riven
[5:31:43] <+AntithesisEK> @ravencloak13 I played WoW for seven years I don't have to cantaThree
[5:31:43] <Malziel> Death To Rivens.
[5:31:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have55 rivens and they're all reasonably good, few godrolls
[5:31:45] <DroppingDead> i got a riven for the redemeer today...its time to make the redemeer great again
[5:31:51] <+valkuma> grakatas are the 2nd best primary in the game.. so yeah
[5:31:51] <Worldbrand> Remember the riven is MR-15 locked or whatever
[5:31:54] <+Lt_Campbell> I got a Riven for my Destraza rapier, that adds 1205 CRIT, +95% dmg to Corpus and +95% dmg to Grineer. its wonderful
[5:31:56] <d3adlyfr0g> I missed his beard so much.
[5:32:04] <+Nephthyz> I got two rivens in a row once, that felt pretty good.
[5:32:04] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat you want a Prisma Grakata if you can get one , otherwise Regular grakatas are great too
[5:32:09] <gerahwar> Bad stats will still be bad stats.
[5:32:11] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I kinda miss Egg-Pat
[5:32:11] <renogaza> rivens dont cost anything and dont harm anyone (except their pride)
[5:32:14] <ravencloak13> @angriestpat Their are also fucking crazy mods like this one mod that makes you deal like, 5 times damage but when you shot your bullets could go anywhere.
[5:32:37] <Jonesman64> the disposition system is BULL SHIT
[5:32:55] <+AntithesisEK> Riven crucible would be somethin' else but that'll never happen.
[5:32:55] <ShoddySpice> disposition is number 1 bullshit
[5:32:56] <Ragnarok1776> Still a weird issue though since practically every weapon is end-game viable even without rivens.
[5:32:57] <%AvoineRa1n> hating rivens means hating the lotus because lotus is riven
[5:32:58] <+HavenlessWF> I have some almost god tier Rivens for really garbage weapons, and no they don't help
[5:33:04] <gerahwar> As much as we love we love to meme it up. Some things cannot be memeable.
[5:33:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i love the disposition system, keeps meta weapons from being ultra meta
[5:33:11] <Yum438> I feel like i walked into a university lecture
[5:33:11] <Kratok> Good space mom is bad too
[5:33:21] <+Spaceynose> !uptime
[5:33:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 33m 30s.
[5:33:25] <+Lt_Campbell> does regular grakata rivens work on the twin grakatas?
[5:33:25] <tierney12> the sicarus prime is the most egregious example
[5:33:26] <Haru568> I like the idea of riven I don't really understand all the hate imo
[5:33:29] <renogaza> space mom is waifu
[5:33:31] <fazoburquina> I got a ceramin dagger riven LUL
[5:33:32] <+Razputin217> CLEM
[5:33:43] <+unfoldingchoas> CLEM
[5:33:44] <+AntithesisEK> i think twin grakata are fully unique, @Lt_Campbell
[5:33:46] <gerahwar> CLEM
[5:33:47] <OceanGovernor> PULL THE LEVER
[5:33:48] <GiantRobort> i got a tonkor riven lol
[5:33:49] <+AntithesisEK> but it would work on prisma grakata
[5:33:49] <cizal11> @Lt_Campbell they're a separate type of weapon.
[5:33:50] <+Lt_Campbell> laaame
[5:33:51] <MettleWolf> CLEM
[5:33:55] <GreatestGuess> CLEM
[5:33:55] <SunsetJack> Rivens are probably the reason why you would forma a weapon cause it costs A LOT of points.
[5:33:57] <ravencloak13> @lt_campbell Probably not because duel wield and single are different things
[5:34:01] <ShoddySpice> I got 3 Sentinel Weapon Rivens in a row.
[5:34:05] <ThalesMeh> Example: A weapon with 5% status and crit chance, 1.5 crit damage and 80 Physical DMG and low fire rate. This shit isnt going to be good no matter how godly the riven for it is.
[5:34:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> people who don't like rivens generally just hate that they can't get that lanka riven for under 1200plat
[5:34:09] <Brozime> @AngriestPat the most frustrating bit is that if they just used RNG the player can spend resources on to turn in their favor they'd be fine right now they represent an infinite and impossible grind that is becoming almost needed at endgame with Eidolons
[5:34:11] <+Andrizzleton> CLEM is my JAM
[5:34:36] <Ragnarok1776> It's fine if aren't aiming for a specific riven, people get upset because they interact with the wrong mentality
[5:34:43] <+Nephthyz> I got a Silva & Aegis riven and also a Javlok riven this week. I do not know if these weapons are any good.
[5:34:43] <+AntithesisEK> that's a big generalized, I have a galatine riven and I still think they're a massive uncontrollable misstep
[5:34:53] <renogaza> grakata rivens dont work on twin grakata because its a rifle riven and twin grakata is submachine-gun somehow
[5:34:57] <urs0jb> it isn't needed for endgame
[5:35:05] <gerahwar> Praise RNG-jesus
[5:35:09] <Worldbrand> I think that's hyperbolic
[5:35:10] <Malziel> YUP
[5:35:12] <suikudo> Rivens are super overkill and not needed
[5:35:14] <Ragnarok1776> "almost needed" absolutely not lol
[5:35:18] <+QuadraticGravity> Definitely an exaggeration.
[5:35:19] <fazoburquina> Rivens are super unecesary
[5:35:20] <Haru568> it's not needed for endgame
[5:35:21] <Croetec> that's pretty hyberbolic
[5:35:22] <Malziel> You wanna save the most time and 1-shot eidolon limbs? You need a riven to do that.
[5:35:26] <aeonicvector> for OPTIMAL eidolon hunts, eg more then one set of 3
[5:35:27] <ravencloak13> Yeah, they can improve it but it isn’t as bad as your making it out to be.
[5:35:30] <+windiwindi> I hate rivens cause it's still power creep as all hell
[5:35:31] <%HRDSalami654> And this is why I can't watch Brozime.
[5:35:32] <Malziel> @Croetec It's really not. zimePalm
[5:35:35] <Cyphereous> @AngriestPat Since mods are limited the Rivens can push weapons past the current limitations
[5:35:37] <+AntithesisEK> <almost> because eidolons killing is all about efficiency in a small time window
[5:35:43] <TheSpartanThief> I just sell my veiled versions. Let everyone else lose their minds, I'll just use my one Opticor one...and it's not NEEDED for Endgame, it's just optimal.
[5:35:46] <Kratok> Plague needs a nap
[5:35:47] <Croetec> it really is, you don't absolutely need a riven for eidolons, if they creep higher then possibly
[5:35:48] <+RedBandolier> cheer500 Reroll it you coward
[5:35:48] <%HRDSalami654> He's so wrong about this.
[5:36:02] <cizal11> listen as plague takes credit from brozimes solo teralyst video advice
[5:36:03] <Malziel> @Croetec You ABSOLUTELY need a riven for the highest level of min/max play
[5:36:03] <renogaza> rivens are fun, thats all there is to it, we all wanted OP so DE gave us OP, now youre all btchin about it
[5:36:06] <DroppingDead> reminder of rip raids
[5:36:06] <+QuadraticGravity> People LOVE to exaggerate how hard endgame content is.
[5:36:09] <luxcaelum> unless you are cheesing super hard yeah you need rivens
[5:36:13] <Brozime> @HRDSalami654 provide facts to back that up
[5:36:17] <Malziel> @QuadraticGravity It's not about difficulty, it's about efficiency
[5:36:17] <+Cobra743> @AngriestPat 3 in one night HAH try 12 in one night if your good

[5:36:23] <+Clemchower> time to refresh to get daily reward :)
[5:36:27] <stigna1> @Malziel Sure but you have ZERO need to actually reach the highest level of play.

[5:36:41] <tierney12> mr eli bitch LUL
[5:36:44] <%Gogogolem> I hate rivens
[5:36:44] <Malziel> @stigna1 The hell I do! The highest level of play is something I actively enjoy chasing
[5:36:51] <%HRDSalami654> Which part? That Riven aren't required or that Brozime always acts like he's correct in everything he says?
[5:37:00] <+Clemchower> Nitain alert btw
[5:37:03] <KruelDestiny> Thanks for the stream Pat :)
[5:37:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Brozime is quite knowledgable but that saryn video he made was misinformed af
[5:37:17] <+CruelOak> the thing is brozime isint plague or pat so he is right
[5:37:18] <+Ciphris> adhom isn't an argument
[5:37:21] <applesonthemoon> look at that direct insult to try and instigate a fight LUL
[5:37:25] <ravencloak13> @malziel Wait, so whats your take on Rivens then?
[5:37:25] <+windiwindi> I would love I'd my drakgoon was useful outside of mid tier infested missions lol
[5:37:29] <+forebringer> @HRDSalami654 I mean to be fair he also uses math to back it up
[5:37:29] <Malziel> @HRDSalami654 For the highest level of Eidolon play, you *do* need rivens
[5:37:30] <+saddas665> #bullyhunter
[5:37:32] <Maverick2736> @AngriestPat no, rivens are not *needed* for Eidolons. It just makes it more optimal, and the meta always goes for the most super-ultra-optimal. There are a ton of different comps to hunt Eidolons with
[5:37:32] <stigna1> @Malziel Right, and that gives you something to work towards. If it were one-and-done like, say, the syndicates then they'd effectively not exist.
[5:37:33] <Malziel> @ravencloak13 Death To Rivens.
[5:37:43] <%JJCheeker> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[5:37:45] <urs0jb> @AngriestPat just remember vet players on this game exaggerate and complain a lot about certain stuff, they tend to use "useless" and "required" a lot... it isn't as bad as they make it sound, but isn't great either
[5:37:57] <Malziel> @stigna1 Except it doesn't. My chances of getting a lanka riven are what, 1 / ~1500 a day?
[5:37:59] <renogaza> rivens are supposed to be fun, who cares if theyre broken if the whole game is pve, everyone pat plays with stands to gain when he uses a riven
[5:38:01] <+AntithesisEK> malziel is a good ziel
[5:38:03] <KruelDestiny> GivePls Elmo
[5:38:04] <ravencloak13> @malziel But can’t you just a bunch of people together and just attack it really fast?
[5:38:10] <%HRDSalami654> He uses math and then acts like the opinion he has is based off of that math.
[5:38:23] <%HRDSalami654> Which is dangerous.
[5:38:24] <Malziel> @ravencloak13 The optimal eidolon farm requires people to actively not shoot the eidolon due to how Madurai works.
[5:38:29] <Cyphereous> It used to be that way, lol
[5:38:32] <%JJCheeker> saddas LuL
[5:38:34] <Everpresent_Overseer> It used to commit to the new before

[5:38:47] <%HRDSalami654> Pretty much.
[5:38:48] <ravencloak13> @malziel Then what’s the problem then?
[5:38:54] <Brozime> @HRDSalami654 that's a baseless thing to say

[5:39:18] <stigna1> @Malziel It may be my proclivity to mediocre weapons like the Torid, but I've not had too much difficulty acquiring rivins. But yeah, its a long-term project for extra work towards optimal death-god-power, as a step up from maximum death-god-power.

[5:39:24] <Malziel> @ravencloak13 The issue is that you need a riven in order to get enough damage to 1-shot an eidolon limb as a DPS frame, and only a single person can actively be shooting. The amount of time you save per-eidolon ads up
[5:39:27] <%ifightmyfriends> Elmo :3
[5:39:27] <xanerts> pat looks fucking dead
[5:39:30] <Maverick2736> EXACTLY what @urs0jb said. Some elitist veterans use those terms ad nauseam, but the meta in this game is not as absolutely necessary as they make it seem to clear anything in the game unless you really want to be as ultra-meta-efficient as inhumanly possible.
[5:39:38] <KruelDestiny> <3 Elmo
[5:39:39] <+Razputin217> !uptime
[5:39:40] <+mikesniderman> Dude I'm so sad I can't port my ps4frame to pc
[5:39:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 39m 48s.
[5:39:41] <%HRDSalami654> I mean everyone does it, the difference is that you have to be aware of when you do it.
[5:39:47] <Shooterboy23> plague is boring pat to death
[5:39:52] <Malziel> @stigna1 Dude, have you seen riven market prices? even for an unrolled lanka riven you're looking at *hundreds* of plat
[5:39:53] <gerahwar> I havent seen the sun in the past week since I began to farm for kuva

[5:40:24] <JackMcStone> Pls sleep.
[5:40:24] <Ragnarok1776> @Malziel Because it's extremely popular to roll right now. Most rivens are very cheap, even good ones
[5:40:33] <stigna1> Baiii! Night all! ^_^
[5:40:34] <Kratok> Elmo go to sleep

[5:40:43] <%Phobaws06> STFU ELMO
[5:40:43] <+Ciphris> shut the fuck up elmo
[5:40:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can get a riven for an obscure weapon you like for around 50 to 100 plat
[5:40:45] <%TheMattman1313> Stay golden Elmo :3
[5:40:47] <ArcticAsylum> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[5:40:50] <TheSpartanThief> STFU ELMO!
[5:40:50] <applesonthemoon> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[5:40:51] <Malziel> @Ragnarok1776 That's not my point. For that specific endgame content, you *need* a riven for that specific weapon, which is prohibitively expensive
[5:40:53] <Lysdexic9541> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[5:40:54] <+KShirahama> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[5:40:55] <Zepik> he also has hours of Undyne homework to get in one of these days
[5:40:56] <%RevenTheLight> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[5:41:03] <Kratok> What a stupid endscreen
[5:41:11] <MettleWolf> Can't get enough of that part
[5:41:11] <%Phobaws06> It's the best
