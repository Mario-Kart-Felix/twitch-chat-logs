[0:09:02] <+Corrack92> FF17 gets directed by Yoko Taro and is a direct sequel to this quest line
[0:09:05] <Psyramics> its all story stuff man
[0:09:18] <nevan_44> so much LUL
[0:09:18] <StaceMcGate> like all the good story is hidden in the non-msq content
[0:09:23] <%shurtal> goddamnit i bought crypt dust instead of twine FUCK
[0:09:23] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt is it voiced though?

[0:09:34] <%athuramn> I remember reading that hours ago
[0:09:36] <BeezusHrist> @StaceMcGate is it voiced?
[0:09:38] <iosephe> @BeezusHrist Alexander is really cool story stuff
[0:09:39] <StaceMcGate> almost none of it is voiced
[0:09:39] <%athuramn> and wondering how he was gonna say it LOL
[0:09:49] <StaceMcGate> and only like 40% of the MSQ is voiced
[0:09:54] <%BoxNavy> who? monkaS
[0:09:54] <BeezusHrist> @StaceMcGate yeah... not for me then.
[0:10:07] <BeezusHrist> @StaceMcGate most of shadowbringers was voiced.
[0:10:22] <StaceMcGate> I completely disagree with your decision but its your money if you only want to do MSQ
