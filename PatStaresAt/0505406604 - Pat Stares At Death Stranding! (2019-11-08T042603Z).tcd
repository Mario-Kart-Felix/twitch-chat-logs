Finished it before watching you and it kinda fell apart for me near the end, but I enjoyed most of it. I honestly prefer a HEAVILY modded FO4 (talking 300+), adding things like skills to the game. Novel concept in an RPG, right? It might just be because I like settlement building though. I'll be replaying the still better New Vegas while I listen to that - also you should make Paige play NV

[0:21:54] <dukenux> Im still hoping for Sam Lake cameo, though.
[0:21:57] <%ShichiNoBushi> A metroidvania platform with a bunnygirl and a fairy named Ribbon.

[0:22:23] <+xstarky151x> Rabi Ribi is good, but it isn't a Hollow Knight contender
[0:22:24] <+moranprime> Rich Evans and @AngriestPat would be the best epic cameo in Death Stranding

[1:53:12] <DeliciousOrangeArt> dayPwr dayUhoh dayHot Sam is jacked.
[1:53:12] <AllonBachuth> 55kg seems reasonable
[1:53:13] <swampgas> your mission: burn mom
[1:53:13] <%Jrocy247> This is pretty fucked
[1:53:14] <+RAGING_1NF3RNO> oh, man. that looks so tunny.
[1:53:14] <+SickBangerzM9> this is creepy as hell
[1:53:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> your mom weighs 55kgs
[1:53:15] <transporterthesequel> Drink your MONSTER ENERGY to burn PRESIDENT MOM
[1:53:15] <Psyramics> get your Monster Energy (tm) canteen? Got your shades? lets rock
[1:53:15] <paranormalpervert> I've carried more, the trick is how you distribute the weight, looks as good as it could get honestly
[1:53:16] <Flarepulse> 121 lbs
[1:53:17] <%BioApple> so what's the odds the game just ends if you take too long
[1:53:19] <%corepool> why is it in metric lol
[1:53:19] <%GraceTBM> that wasn't fucking norman reedus
[1:53:21] <%crimsonharvest> uh is it me or is this facility inside a huge crater
[1:53:21] <broseidonssb> it's only 30 minutes away
[1:53:21] <lamekidthagawd> he's back must be destroyed
[1:53:21] <Tonicky > The wackiest of buddy travel movies a guy and his mom's corpse
[1:53:21] <%juxtest> Gonna need the good Monster for this one.
[1:53:22] <bone_reaper69> you gotta run! can't take any of these cars we have lined up at the gate
[1:53:24] <santystuffs> Pat for everything that is sacred, please drop her
[1:53:25] <Thenuclearwalrus> If this is America why Metric?
[1:53:25] <Junkfist> Hey guys couldn't you have drained my mom's body of fluids and chopped it up before strapping it onto my back? I could make a couple trips if you put her in suitcases or something.
[1:53:26] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah, guess im an idiot for not double checking the spelling of charon/chrion, my bad. just seemed to make a whole lot of sence giving the connections theme
[1:53:27] <Goldenwolf98> damage the delivery LUL
[1:53:28] <%Rumbutt> Don't damage your mom Pat
[1:53:28] <mercado94> I love this game

[1:53:29] <KruelDestiny> drop the body off a cliff and see what happens PogChamp

[1:53:35] <deviljhojho_> METRIC BABY
[1:53:35] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat S-rank Piggy-back your mom to the crematorium style
[1:53:36] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Drop your mom Pat
[1:53:36] <falconx9k> Equipped: Dead Mom
[1:53:36] <C_Sixty_Jam> That's a long way
[1:53:38] <+Tokanova> can you just follow the river up the mountain?
[1:53:39] <BigNerdSam> Eh, that's about as heavy as my college backpack. I will probably need a walker when I'm a boomer.
[1:53:43] <%depressed_skeleton> Just dump her in a ditch, Mission Complete.
[1:53:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> Straight up a waterfall
[1:53:44] <spaxis_> Pat, this is very important, did you remember to drink Monster Energy™ drink?
[1:53:44] <Dragon_Batman> To its north might be clear
[1:53:45] <%IntrepidEye> so is this technically a timed mission?
[1:53:46] <+Pajex_> swim upstream
[1:53:47] <+GhostThane> does dropping make the boom boom happen faster?
[1:53:48] <Nexoosen> R O U T E S P O T T E D
[1:53:48] <Demon_chann> Yeah
[1:53:49] <%yeknomlive> looks like you and ma are gonna have a road trip
[1:53:49] <+RelaxedPizza> Death Stranding, Ep. 2- Microwave Your Mom
[1:53:49] <+Terrabyte0> PRETTY MUCH
[1:53:50] <Hellarussian> u sure can
[1:53:50] <swampgas> yes
[1:53:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> Is there a topography mode?
[1:53:50] <+griffball13> there is a waterfall
[1:53:51] <C_Sixty_Jam> Go the other way
[1:53:53] <%crimsonharvest> follow the water up maybe? or north through the crater wall and then east
[1:53:54] <C_Sixty_Jam> See what happened
[1:53:54] <+Tokanova> wonder if you can climb it
[1:53:55] <TungstenViper> @corepool because it's not a shitty system
[1:53:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can make it
[1:53:56] <warmnoid> the easiest way is filled with death claws and cazadores
[1:53:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just dump her right there and book it out of the blast zone
[1:53:59] <Kefkaisnotamused> Seriously cant just take a boat a couple miles out?
[1:54:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I went that way
[1:54:00] <coracor> so go around north of the mountain
[1:54:01] <librettodude> So who's the world record holder for Speed-running Your Mom?
[1:54:02] <%Reveresao> go up from there
[1:54:02] <%waifoong98> May be there is a tunnel?
[1:54:03] <lloyddboy> there's a BRIDGE
[1:54:04] <NeroInfinite> you can
[1:54:05] <reonome> just build a bridge Kappa
[1:54:06] <+TheLastStar> Looks like sams carrying alot of... DEAD WEIGHT...
[1:54:07] <GUNxSPECTRE> topography IRL
[1:54:07] <dukenux> theres a ravine east of river
[1:54:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What is "55.4 kg & 120.0 kg"??? (bottom left)
[1:54:09] <%THATGUY_789> that's elevation
[1:54:09] <falconx9k> Just find a dumpster behind an alley
[1:54:13] <+palebluedots> @AngriestPat Can you make it into a topographic map?
[1:54:14] <$Bison_Says_YES> just use your mom as a grappling hook
[1:54:14] <%corepool> @TungstenViper chill
[1:54:15] <%jiin6> Walk through the Death claw nest
[1:54:19] <%honeyman18> HIKE IT BOOMER
[1:54:21] <%spiritofmojave> just Bridge it Bridges 4Head
[1:54:22] <abatage> it's all good pat - just start travelling and you'll find a weigh
[1:54:22] <Nina96> do u have a time limit?
[1:54:22] <%Reveresao> look at the topography pat
[1:54:23] <breakerdsx> 122 lbs
[1:54:23] <santystuffs> @Kefkaisnotamused there is no boats, rain destroys em really quick
[1:54:24] <cimturry> @AngriestPat F RANK YOUR MOM
[1:54:24] <%Aoko_Aozaki> damn ddidn't realize Pat was a top level topography navigation master
[1:54:25] <moofyspacejump> start traveling to Quebec
[1:54:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nero's senses *Dead Weight*
[1:54:27] <%Neo_Kaiser> Just fast travel there.
[1:54:28] <KattyCitty> 147 pounds
[1:54:28] <+allups> rivers are ur friends irl for stuffime thjs
[1:54:29] <+PapaGravestone> oh no i just got here and the first thing i see is youre laying president mom to rest. yeesh
[1:54:29] <+Mottyrob> Is there a topography setting?
[1:54:31] <deviljhojho_> METRIC BABY
[1:54:31] <Mendin> Looks like a ridge at the north-west part of that straight river piece at the end
[1:54:35] <+palebluedots> used over max weight
[1:54:36] <%crimsonharvest> but the weight is graduated, it turns yellow and gets problematic before getting full
[1:54:38] <theamazingroberto> so even with your mom equipped you should still have good roll
[1:54:38] <IndoorSitup> YEYEYEYE COURSE PLOT5ING
[1:54:40] <+spaceroyalty> so she's about 120 pounds
[1:54:40] <+griffball13> your mom ways about 120 lbs
[1:54:40] <$RubberFistFight> that's your encumbrance limit I'd imagine.
[1:54:40] <gslayer14> your dead mum is only 55.4
[1:54:41] <+Trancefearence> They are paying for same-day shipping, You better get there on time fuckface
[1:54:43] <bahamut1010> this game doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch
[1:54:44] <TungstenViper> @corepool I'm the chilliest LUL
[1:54:44] <Nerdwarp112> If the first mission is incinerating our mom, are we nuking our uncle next? @angriestpat
[1:54:45] <gslayer14> floaty
[1:54:45] <Kefkaisnotamused> I would definitely prefer a zombie apocalypse to this shyte.
[1:54:47] <+funnyfunnykid> So how far away is everything?
[1:54:49] <%Captainahab_37> I wonder what the last weight upgrade is and how large we can GET
[1:54:50] <lexitheshark> The president ways 121.88 pounds
[1:54:52] <C_Sixty_Jam> @AngriestPat See if you can get a motor cycle
[1:54:54] <lexitheshark> weighs*
[1:55:01] <IndoorSitup> C O U R S E P L O T T I NG
[1:55:04] <KattyCitty> weighed*
[1:55:06] <+Pars_Librum> I can almost hear the goblins scratching in this mind
[1:55:07] <$RubberFistFight> @SpaceGuntank @griffball13 thank god this game uses real units instead of lbs though. Kappa
[1:55:08] <%IntrepidEye> use you dead mum as a boat
[1:55:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat OH it's 55.4 current / 120.0 possible. Got it.
[1:55:09] <SparkAfterDark> That's including the other shit on his back and the wrapping so she's probably lighter
[1:55:11] <Vermillion129> 121.25 lbs
[1:55:12] <Tennochief> don't dunk your mom
[1:55:15] <reonome> jesus christ
[1:55:15] <transporterthesequel> There is a 100% chance of Waterfall, btw
[1:55:16] <swampgas> motorcycle is like 30-1hr from now depending on how long he takes
[1:55:17] <%waifoong98> oh wow map is actually 3d
[1:55:18] <$Bison_Says_YES> i like the route being placed by individual makers
[1:55:20] <+pkmamsters> !uptime
[1:55:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 55m.
[1:55:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 121 is pretty hefty for a cancer patient, unless she's tall as shit
[1:55:21] <%mintyrobo> ohhh, that's a water fall
[1:55:21] <%crimsonharvest> that looks like a waterfall huh
[1:55:23] <zettig> Oh God! I just realized that Sam is UNCLE SAM!

[1:59:39] <Arek_1> @GovernmentmYass That's bait.
[1:59:42] <C_Sixty_Jam> To be fair, you have to have a VERY high 300IQ to understand Kotaku
[1:59:48] <Tennochief> @TheHeroAppears he'd have to piss with enough force to make a bunch of XL Monster energy drinks

[2:05:13] <bigbeefbeatin> HUD
[2:05:13] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's based on your regional settings (not sure what you're playing this on), Since you're Canadian it defaults to metric, aka a proper measuring system.
[2:05:14] <Desertfishing> region based

[2:13:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> That cliff tho
[2:13:10] <Louie_Salmon> You should air combo her when you get there, then the cremation is the finisher
[2:13:10] <Nina96> go right
[2:13:11] <+Jsaru> don't want the necrosis to go faster
[2:13:13] <Paperware> I'd like a New Vegas remake where all you do is deliver things to people
[2:13:18] <robodisney> maybe corpses are like fruit. Your bruise them and they go bad faster
[2:13:18] <%Neo_Kaiser> So what would happen if a mail man tripped down a precipice and nobody knew he was there?
[2:13:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Someone set us up the bomb
[2:13:19] <$Bison_Says_YES> My dead Moms a Nuke and refuses to walk

[2:13:24] <%Captainahab_37> so how are there not people in these habitats not like, dying from heart attacks and exploding?
[2:13:29] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat The ranks increase your stats, so don't damage the packages

[2:18:45] <+sonicitus> Burn that mum.
[2:18:45] <Drivershaft> it causes timefall

[2:18:47] <spaxis_> Is the president actually his mom?
[2:18:48] <+Nomicro4u> It disperses the black goo into the air
[2:18:49] <jamesofn> the former i think
[2:18:52] <%Saltmeisterr> rip
[2:18:52] <%MagickBurritoh> disburses the shit inside them
[2:18:52] <NeroInfinite> It just gets rid of thebody before it gos nuclear
[2:18:52] <%crimsonharvest> the process of necrosis seems to cause the monster
[2:18:53] <+griffball13> no body to explode i guess

[2:18:54] <%onlypuppet> F F F F F F F F F F F F
[2:18:54] <+GhostThane> i guess it burns them before they can go boom?

[2:18:54] <%Captainahab_37> is your mom Samus and is the baby a Metroid and are you SAM, son of SAMUS?!
[2:18:55] <Dragon_Batman> I would guess that mass turns into goo
[2:18:55] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat Dead people turn into BTs not explode

[2:50:09] <simpleskeleton> Shake the BB!!
[2:50:10] <Octoppai> him smear hims lil face on the glass
[2:50:11] <Dragon_Batman> Dooms allow you to sense or see the BTS
[2:50:11] <%waifoong98> LUL
[2:50:12] <Monkeyweed21> no thats repatriate DOOMS is ghost powers
[2:50:12] <abatage> DOOMS let's him sense Bts
[2:50:12] <coracor> ok DOOMER
[2:50:12] <%crimsonharvest> GHOST INFECTION
[2:50:12] <DamnGoodCake> Why does Deadman have a massive scar across his forhead?
[2:50:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> STD
[2:50:13] <%superc37> THATS A GOOD DISEASE
[2:50:14] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat So he's the Chosen Undead
[2:50:14] <NeroInfinite> He was born with it
[2:50:15] <Vlesh> Die Hardman has it too
[2:50:17] <+joyoustechnoshrine> its probably genetic
[2:50:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> He has "Extinction Factor", whatever that is.
[2:50:19] <D3rrtyD4n> i want to be a DOOMER
[2:50:20] <%whiskey_wolfe_> NO PAIGE U ALREADY HAVE UR DISEASE
[2:50:21] <wildrage66> tsbBigbrain
[2:50:21] <42nfl19> DOOMs are BT sensitive and Reprorate can revive @AngriestPat
[2:50:21] <$EldritchBee> No DOOMS is a different thing
[2:50:22] <BunnyEmperor> LUL yes Paige you must be born by DOOMER parents
[2:50:22] <HiggsV> It doesn't affect Lupus Users sorry Paige
[2:50:22] <$FrogROOT> the cbts
[2:50:23] <abatage> being a Repatriate means he can come back
[2:50:24] <+MrBrowny0> What's the downside?
[2:50:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Captainahab_37 The creepiest and pastaist of them
[2:50:27] <+GhostThane> bb helps amplify i think too
[2:50:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> and then he eats the bb
[2:50:28] <%DraxTD> He's also still a bomb if eaten @AngriestPat
[2:50:28] <jamesofn> no thats different, DOOMS lets you sense BTs, Repatriate is the thing that lets him come back
[2:50:30] <SparkAfterDark> No DOOMS makes him able to detect BTs. it's Repatriatism that makes him come back
[2:50:32] <+MechaBaphomet> the CBTs
[2:50:33] <17sevens> DOOMS and being a repartiate have not been said to be the same thing
[2:50:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> And Fragile.
[2:50:37] <$EldritchBee> DOOMS is like some astrological innate thing
[2:50:38] <bone_reaper69> @AngriestPat DOOMS is just you sensing BTs. Patriat or something makes you revive from dead
[2:50:38] <Hellarussian> now i know what a TV dinner feels like
[2:50:38] <$HeroToxiko> OH die hardman
[2:50:38] <lloyddboy> Repatriate is respawn
[2:50:39] <TheFilth> separate thing DOOMS and repatriate
[2:50:42] <AllonBachuth> how do we know DieHardman has it and isn't faking?
[2:50:45] <royaldicklick> ?
[2:50:45] <%onlypuppet> Just smoke a lot of cigarettes and pray for Death
[2:50:46] <TheBadoe> I guess it sucks because he can still rot and still be alive?

[3:28:36] <$RubberFistFight> @BlackMage66652 Hideo Kojima, that's why
[3:28:38] <royaldicklick> @AngriestPat why does America look like a volcanic island?
[3:28:39] <samfaust> Are we there yet?
[3:28:42] <FenixSeraph> how much of the stream has been gameplay so far
[3:28:42] <Lamedhos> he didn't lose any, just ladders
[3:28:46] <xtremegamer80> Good point
[3:28:47] <Aquaczaz> needs more muttering "this is heavy as shit what the fuck" "everyone needs this stupid bullshit all the time"
[3:28:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> big brain
[3:28:51] <cimturry> can you tho?
[3:28:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> are you though
[3:28:58] <%jiin6> Drop all the ladders
[3:28:59] <kingrock531> It actually is walking simulator
[3:29:00] <%Neo_Kaiser> Other players can use his ladders too.
[3:29:00] <%Captainahab_37> plus you can probably get more ladders
[3:29:01] <C_Sixty_Jam> True
[3:29:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no one said Scotland
[3:29:03] <royaldicklick> ok...
[3:29:06] <Fdrank> Maryland looks like that
[3:29:06] <%marsanta> Because Scotland is the end of the world
[3:29:08] <Goldenwolf98> Timefall makes everything Scottish
[3:29:09] <+jcenderion> TIME RAIN CLIMATE CHANGE
[3:29:10] <arkv01> yeah the timefall explains everything, like the timecube
[3:29:10] <SaintSadistic> Iceland*
[3:29:10] <Hellarussian> TIMEQUAKE
[3:29:11] <%Neo_Kaiser> Then like his ladders for points
[3:29:13] <+GhostThane> timefall made the supervolcanoes erupt
[3:29:15] <%arancet> but nothing in the land changes when it rains, not the ground, not the rivers, not the plants @AngriestPat
[3:29:15] <arkv01> now start the ups race war
[3:29:16] <+OperatorPlease> trees can't exist
[3:29:17] <+OperatorPlease> moss can
[3:29:17] <implied_consent> San must have an incredible ass and legs.
[3:29:17] <BigBadWaffle> liking the game so far? @AngriestPat
[3:29:17] <%Tucker0603> Iceland actually
[3:29:18] <Manjove> this is the woolie station
[3:29:23] <Charuzu> and Kojima didn't want a typical post-apocalypse look
[3:29:24] <Manjove> all about the chemicals
[3:29:31] <fraudmaid> based timefall making america comfy again
[3:29:31] <%honeyman18> Also about a 10,000,000 nuclear explosions
[3:29:31] <%Captainahab_37> well timefall probably does a lot of bad shit in just a few years
[3:29:39] <+Punchasaur> But the moss and grass should be dead then
[3:29:40] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo Feets
[3:29:44] <%Deadpal> who... is this?
[3:29:45] <Aquaczaz> re-optimize your shaz

[3:32:59] <nah_stradamus> you didnt notice you walked that far because of the timefall, pat. its fine.
[3:33:04] <Idon__> America is a lot smaller than I remember, lol.
[3:33:05] <cimturry> America is really small now but it kept the shape
[3:33:05] <%chi199> @angriestpat do you think you’ll stream more of this in the future?
[3:33:07] <%rytisone> America is about 50 miles long

[3:39:13] <Habblewater> Do these Postboxes carry over into other people's games or nah?
[3:39:15] <%THATGUY_789> @time_puncher I mentioned that at the beginning too. cause there's like a whole antimatter universe too
[3:39:18] <%Run44forrest> anchovies are awful what is wrong with you
[3:39:19] <Tennochief> alright I'm going bed now, good night
[3:39:21] <TheBadoe> I preferred their old recipe too
[3:39:23] <$RubberFistFight> @THATGUY_789 sure did. Pizza Hut was on the decline for a while, and then they decided to switch out their more popular basic pizzas to a "gourmet" menu and charge a bunch more for them, whilst not actually changing anything about the pizza. I worked for the call center for a little while. The company was run by idiots then, and it's run by idiots now. They deserve to be outcompeted.

[3:41:37] <+fugatlas> impact bands are a super real thing but are kinda sus. They're essentially ink packs with plastic wrappers that have different pressure tolerances to pop given enough force. Thing is they can be kinda unreliable

[4:03:19] <%crimsonharvest> map please?
[4:03:21] <Monkeyweed21> it was made by players running that way
[4:03:23] <Decsevm> only paige can fight death it's self
[4:03:28] <librettodude> The roads are built from overlapping player paths, from what I remember
[4:03:31] <royaldicklick> oh cool
[4:03:38] <Tedious_Tickles> I feel like this is the kind of game where if you saw a BT bug out it would only make it more creepier instead of laughable
[4:03:38] <senatorarmstrong_2020> dirt trail made by you
[4:03:39] <dukenux> oh nice
[4:03:39] <GUNxSPECTRE> Paige is literally Lady Death

[4:03:52] <TheBadoe> That's cool
[4:03:52] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:03:52] <nzrai> what so it's an optimal path
[4:03:53] <NiktenKing> making footpaths
[4:03:53] <Everything_is_Awful> Pat, how do you like the game so far? Is it pretentious enough for Kojima standards?
[4:03:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> destiny path
[4:03:56] <%patriotrenegade> Pathfinder Pat
[4:03:59] <Hellarussian> like in the real lifes
[4:03:59] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh so the more people walk on it the more the ground reflects it
[4:04:00] <xtremegamer80> THAT'S LIKE A REAL THING
[4:04:03] <%onlypuppet> While I was telling Mom how disappointed-not-angry I was, did Kogima
[4:04:03] <xGeneralDOOM> just like real life PogChamp
[4:04:04] <%Neo_Kaiser> The Road Less Travelled: Morrowind
[4:04:05] <Bad4Health> death's pretty easy to outrun until you're old and slow
[4:04:06] <%THATGUY_789> game trails
[4:04:09] <Kejang> And then Timefall destroys them so it's not that easy
[4:04:12] <nzrai> i love it
[4:04:16] <%crimsonharvest> man i wish i could play this because the environment is very familiar to places i've been
[4:04:20] <royaldicklick> fuck now I wanna trailblaze FeelsBadMan
[4:04:21] <Thenuclearwalrus> Not necessarily the most optimal, just most frequent it seems
[4:04:22] <Rotabrutsama> i like it :)
[4:04:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> how is shower water safe?
[4:04:25] <xtremegamer80> Kojima is so pretentious but so many people love it
[4:04:27] <MagicHatss> I feel like it's gotta shift and cycle lest the whole environment become nothing but footpaths
[4:04:31] <Demon_chann> @AngriestPat I you cant double jump?
[4:04:33] <+Shoosler> How long ago did Pat start the game?
[4:04:34] <Monkeyweed21> Pat just read about the meaning of pyramids while chugging Monster
[4:04:34] <%derap41> Just hiking the Scottish lowlands
[4:04:34] <Tedious_Tickles> pretty sure the strands indicate the BTs are coming

[4:04:44] <%jiin6> look at that Grass Stranding
[4:04:44] <xtremegamer80> When do we get our FUCKING BIKE?
[4:04:45] <MasterDecoder> Walking is fun, who could have known?
[4:04:46] <+OperatorPlease> ...what?
[4:04:49] <Louie_Salmon> Oh god it's true, my game has worn paths around here, you've got all grass.
[4:04:52] <Twistedwolfie> @AngriestPat Do you think the gameplay will get old?

[4:13:23] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Did Paige ever go see the Eye Doctor?
[4:13:32] <lilmac64> Maybe the real baby was the creepy Norman Reedus mpreg art we found along the way.
[4:13:35] <%NopeBadguy> Does BB cease to B?
[4:13:36] <bone_reaper69> Kojima is making parallels. Life is just delivering garbage for likes
[4:13:41] <%Neo_Kaiser> Does Pat consider it littering if he drops his cargo?
[4:13:42] <librettodude> Please the BB, while PP watches
[4:13:44] <MiltoniusPrime> BB appreciates unpaid labor
[4:13:48] <Dragon_Batman> You can handle the BB and calm it and stuff so it's probably related to that
[4:13:50] <Thenuclearwalrus> BB Doesnt like that
[4:13:54] <royaldicklick> @AngriestPat are you at the top of the leaderboards yet?
[4:14:02] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat hey pat, candy corn. yay or nay?

[4:15:10] <bone_reaper69> did anyone ever ask why you need blood in your rope? why would you need to identify a rope?
[4:15:13] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat why does the US suddenly look like Iceland
[4:15:14] <%TheSniperJoe> Elmo is easily the best stream cat.

[4:15:24] <MiltoniusPrime> These metals are barely cooked
[4:15:25] <falconx9k> Elmo judging us
[4:15:28] <GUNxSPECTRE> Jury duty pays by the miles, so it should be for Sam
[4:15:28] <%TheSniperJoe> He understands his angles, just look at how great he is.

[4:34:04] <Tedious_Tickles> it really isn't
[4:34:07] <nzrai> but i like it
[4:34:08] <MagicHatss> It's for a very niche audience
[4:34:09] <royaldicklick> MONSTER TIME
[4:34:10] <falconx9k> It's intriguing
[4:34:11] <%Run44forrest> yeah it is
[4:34:11] <Tedious_Tickles> but yeah, it is interesting
[4:34:12] <thegreenbenis> YOU ARE A AMAZON GUY

[4:34:29] <%NopeBadguy> Should I wait for this on PC?
[4:34:30] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the definite love it or hate it type of thing

[4:51:57] <JayEarly> ARMY BABIES
[4:51:57] <Ion_Laser> The mic is fine
[4:51:57] <+justianxix> Mom, I can do it myself!
[4:51:57] <reonome> YOUR MIC IS FINE PAT YOUR VOICE IS JUST GARBAGE
[4:51:59] <%Ranryu692> Talk into her mic
[4:52:00] <DamnGoodCake> it's not the mic, it's your posture when you speak
[4:52:01] <Nazgul240> your mic is FINE Pat
[4:52:02] <Dragon_Batman> That is probably it
[4:52:04] <Paperware> The Mind Goblins
[4:52:04] <Smileyhat> The mic is fine.
[4:52:05] <cj_art> eh it's not big of an issue
[4:52:06] <ScootyMcRoger> paige was just closer and enunciating chat
[4:52:06] <GUNxSPECTRE> They sound good, maybe fucking do your own PC bullshit
[4:52:09] <ScootyMcRoger> chat is dumb
[4:52:11] <CelestialOR> the mic is fine
[4:52:13] <majindusto> enigmaLurk
[4:52:13] <%AllyBeeBoo> try paiges mic and see if you sound different
[4:52:18] <ToshiDandelion> She was just too close to the microphone and your further, chat is stupid
[4:52:19] <Tedious_Tickles> That explains it, cause Paige mic sounds like it has boost on @AngriestPat
[4:52:20] <Bluewolf544> Honestly i prefer pats reading :)
[4:52:21] <EdibleNewb> I think it's not the mic, it's the vocal cord.
[4:52:23] <%Bailey__gaming> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[4:52:24] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Paige's mic is louder, but if your mic would be like that the whole time, that would be bad.
[4:52:24] <therealtacopancakes> micgoblins
[4:52:27] <WHMBoar> it's not the mic, it's your slouch
[4:52:28] <Aquaczaz> I've got almost a decade of hearing pat's reading style, it's fine haha
[4:52:31] <%floralkami> Your mic is fine, Paige just has the "voice"
[4:52:31] <%derap41> Cause they're a mystery
[4:52:32] <royaldicklick> @AngriestPat I think you're getting jebaited
[4:52:38] <KanukMunch> Pat sounds fine, people just being horny
[4:52:39] <TigerClaws12> Mic Goblins LUL
[4:52:40] <+holygodemperor> Bring back the nice lore lady

[4:52:55] <Monkeyweed21> Your vocal chords are worse than Paige
[4:52:55] <+ravenrooke> theyre the same
[4:52:55] <senatorarmstrong_2020> yeah that was it
[4:52:55] <+justianxix> LUL
[4:52:56] <Ion_Laser> @neroinfinite yeah
[4:52:56] <+DRAGKUDO> her mic just sounds better
[4:52:57] <hamsterdavidson> Pat doesn't understand that his actual human voice is just pixelated
[4:52:58] <lols_royce> Sameness has been achieved

[4:53:11] <Biggredd87> lol she just enunciates better
[4:53:11] <+WorldsBestPanda> Both mics sound the same to me.
[4:53:11] <HeartlessAku> she's just better at reading
[4:53:12] <Eger007> but wtf are bbs
[4:53:15] <%floralkami> GREat
[4:53:15] <NiktenKing> balanced
[4:53:15] <%WarchiefGoldva> Paige's voice is just better than yours, Pat.
[4:53:16] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I don't know what kind of mixer you have, but my guess is it's a pretty complex one. So there'd be a dial there for gain and a dial for amplification. You want to turn them up a little bit, but how much depends on a) how your mic responds to your voice which only you can see, and b) what those dials do on your mixer SPECIFICALLY since they can differ between brands and models.
[4:53:17] <%jiin6> Stand by for Timefall
[4:53:17] <elspiceweasel> its just her voice is way nicer
[4:53:20] <hamsterdavidson> As far as to do what look more like
[4:53:21] <GUNxSPECTRE> Better than the SEX-Sonic bullshit
[4:53:22] <+Herbpudding> paiges voice is teal good

[4:53:32] <MasterDecoder> *Nice
[4:53:34] <%nano_vg> keywords
[4:53:35] <jogs29> mind goblins!
[4:53:38] <DamnGoodCake> it's just paige is projecting her voice more. nothing wrong with the mics. mind goblins slayed
[4:53:38] <+Herbpudding> duhTopdeck
[4:53:39] <SirFailsAlott> paige literally just used to read on stream so she's way better at this
[4:53:41] <xGeneralDOOM> yes
[4:53:43] <kingrock531> She has the voice for reading like butter
[4:53:45] <Dragon_Batman> She isn't as loud which is good, but she has a natural voice quality that is better
[4:53:47] <+Eddy21forsaken> read the encyclopedia paige carciGasm
[4:53:47] <jogs29> ohh no!
[4:53:48] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pat reads it but Paige READS it
[4:53:50] <+TheDeadpoolDash> zzzzzzzzzz
[4:53:50] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige should do Audio Books
[4:53:54] <smugjorgen> pat talk to the other mike and see if there is a diffrence
[4:53:54] <+beanieboi420> It's like Niagara Falls in here

[4:53:58] <%derap41> ...this is some pipesmoking buggery
[4:54:02] <Malziel> That's some Cult shit
[4:54:02] <hamsterdavidson> Paige needs to read science books
[4:54:04] <Aquaczaz> being an audio engineer makes it painful to have twitch chat try to say what's good or not and why >.>
[4:54:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat its more that you try to speed up the reading to keep stream flow going, but it can sacrifice clarity and quality as a result
[4:54:07] <$vincerocmm> timebomb
[4:54:08] <+beanieboi420> Chat be like woolieYE
[4:54:10] <+justianxix> Okay Super Villain

[4:54:23] <Dragon_Batman> Scientist too interested in the science in it
[4:54:27] <NeroInfinite> that would explain why illionos got erased off the face of the earth
[4:54:30] <rubbishbinge> Well, he dies every 23 minutes anyway
[4:54:31] <ShimmerFairy> I genuinely think the main difference was just Paige's mic volume.
[4:54:33] <majindusto> Paige is the voice I hear for Susie in Deltarune!!!
[4:54:37] <Borkbiff > Die-Hardman though...
[4:54:37] <sonicblade38> nothing good has ever happened when some one says the words NEXT EVOLUTION of mankind
[4:54:38] <%floralkami> Hey, science
