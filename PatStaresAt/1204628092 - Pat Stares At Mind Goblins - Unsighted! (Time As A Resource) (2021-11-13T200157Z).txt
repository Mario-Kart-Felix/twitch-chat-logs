[0:25:41] <%tentavision> it's a good map
[0:25:43] <$Futurecity10> please, she probably cant read it
[0:25:43] <%coward_man> I paused the video and began pacing at the sight of that map
[0:25:44] <@Fuggins4U> "I love this map, if only I could see it." @PeachSaliva
[0:25:44] <+BedHome> john ring watches zangief
[0:25:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> If Elden Ring didn't have a map, it'd be fucking insane.
[0:25:47] <%Piemen99> LUL
[0:25:48] <EynoStiles> still get lost
[0:25:49] <%Broand> Man I know people who don't know how to read maps
[0:25:56] <+Walopoh> paige back from tiktok
[0:25:56] <%SinnerEbru> why dont y'all play together and split it across your channels?
[0:25:57] <LBC921> what are you high?
[0:25:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Can she read a map tho?
[0:25:59] <Majestic_Flof> roronora zoro?
[0:25:59] <%UncleAWOL> Roronoa Zoro
[0:26:01] <Shwepie> Map won't help, she'll still get lost.
[0:26:01] <%RayReborne> Roronoa Zoro
[0:26:04] <MarylandJutsu> @Fuggins4U but what if she can hear it?
[0:26:05] <%cvp5127> she'll forget which button it is
[0:26:09] <%MoguManda> luckybunBunz
[0:26:09] <+SuperFightinRobot> I could not possibly play this game, but I look forward to watching you
[0:26:09] <%YakumoYomi> Roronoa Zoro?
[0:26:10] <%RyanGelatin> paige whats the best tiktok
[0:26:10] <+BedHome> was that a one piece reference oh my god pat IS tired
[0:26:14] <%spitelite> the map wont help zoro
[0:26:20] <%Nekros4442> Co-op run could be cool
[0:26:26] <%Ziegsy> Is that a trimmed beard?
[0:26:29] <+BedHome> Lonely Solo, Rorona Zoro
[0:26:30] <%MoguManda> splitting is probably the worst option
[0:26:30] <jman13131313> why
[0:26:34] <%SinnerEbru> idk shitfuck about video content, so fair!
[0:26:35] <%LouieRouie> Zoro thinks north is up
[0:26:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just do Co-op and both stream it. All the donos are going to the same place in the end anyway
[0:26:42] <%Ziegsy> that would do it
[0:26:50] <OldManDeckardCain> it's ok, paige will bang out elden ring by the end of the summer Kappa
[0:26:52] <MarylandJutsu> you do it?
[0:26:52] <%CheesesSliced> Oh, a shower....
[0:26:53] <+BedHome> play elden ring passing the controller on death, it would suck
[0:26:56] <+BedHome> lmao
[0:27:02] <%X2Eliah> bÃ¶rp
[0:27:05] <%RyanGelatin> but its a big open world theyd wanna go to different corners of the map, itd be a lame non co op co op stream
[0:27:10] <+BedHome> the streams will be home before christmas
[0:27:13] <%chance_h> Get dat monie
[0:27:14] <%UvBenServed> OH BOY 4 AM
[0:27:35] <%greasypete00> can you just run into dungeons with coop activated
[0:27:39] <%spitelite> hand hold her through the game
[0:27:40] <@Ranryu692> @BedHome I once tried to record an LP of Max Payne 3 by passing the controller on death. It's a good way to never learn how to play the game LUL
[0:27:41] <%Glass_Muffin> Pat paige and plauge trio gameplay???? Imagine the potential
[0:27:49] <%cvp5127> stream at the same time and race
[0:27:51] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Do it its only gonna be like once every two weeks
[0:27:59] <@Lion_kun> You should do a solo stream and a coop run with a new character
[0:28:02] <RushUnplugged> doesn't it synch with a password connection?
[0:28:14] <%CheesesSliced> Rope in Woolie...
[0:28:14] <AngryPumpkin1995> Hey Pat, been watching the mind goblin streams for dishonoured, congrats on confronting those bastard mind goblins. :D
[0:28:15] <%RayReborne> yeah big no funs
[0:28:17] <%chance_h> Level 1 deprived coop
[0:28:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> History has shown that the viewers don't care for overpowered characters in From Soft games.
[0:28:42] <bob900000> LUL
[0:28:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:28:45] <@Ranryu692> Paige would get the game a month early and not get around to playing it until 3 months later anyway
[0:28:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> that'd be crazy
[0:28:59] <%X2Eliah> @Ranryu692 >Naw that's Woolie
[0:29:00] <%holydeviant1> Unsighted is actually running on my personal goblins, so GOOD LUCK
[0:29:14] <RushUnplugged> Paige blacklisted by bamco nandai
[0:29:29] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 With Woolie it would be closer to 2 years
[0:29:36] <%CheesesSliced> Sounds like something that would happen to a Yahoo amountcc
[0:29:47] <jman13131313> ????
[0:29:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> But no horse combat in co-op
[0:29:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't imagine having a consistent co-op partner for that much game tho
[0:29:54] <%X2Eliah> @Ranryu692 mmm fair
[0:29:55] <%Mr_Pylon> buahaduabuada?
[0:29:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Are you awake?

[0:30:53] <%twistedj3ster> You'd have to wait for Woolie by just standing in the next room for ten minutes
[0:30:59] <Treasure_Vault> I'd rather watch two LPs though?

[0:31:27] <+foomaster22> When how long ago did he beat Sekiro???
[0:31:27] <@Lion_kun> Corona is endemic. It will always be around.
[0:31:27] <%Mr_Pylon> I'm betting on Woolie playing it in 2024
[0:31:30] <RushUnplugged> if Woolie played ER on release he'd just catch on fire
[0:31:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> 2033 lets ho
[0:31:31] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:31:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggie's gotta play every souls game still LUL

[0:31:43] <Phalanx_Soul> Covid is the worst IRL horde mode ever
[0:31:47] <%JamesCorck> Invade Woolie and Reggie while they're streaming. We're most likely going to see a Reggie VS on Elden Ring.
[0:31:49] <%Puhff> Aren't Paige and Woolie vaccinated?
[0:31:54] <%baka_sugoi> moon
[0:31:56] <%Aeoneth> Reggie and Paige Coop while Pat and Woolie coach repesctively for maximum shenanigans
[0:31:58] <+trackles_64> that sounds plausible
[0:31:59] <%JamesCorck> Reggie VS Dark Souls 2, I hope we see that.
[0:32:03] <primaryfire> I love this idea
[0:32:05] <+D00msDayDan> Woolie is too easy to dunk on
[0:32:08] <%holydeviant1> >Pat and Dracula are neighbors in the future
[0:32:15] <+BedHome> @Lion_kun it WILL BE endemic when it stops being a inter continentally varying life risk , till then its just a pandemic that rich people would rather you die from than the economy slows from controlling it
[0:32:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh I get it :)
[0:32:21] <Enthaarungscreme> Moonbase. Is that what they call institutions now
[0:32:21] <+trackles_64> But its true tho
[0:32:22] <@Ranryu692> I hope you and Woolie can record a game of Metal Gear Risk someday
[0:32:23] <%chance_h> I hope ffxiv has moon housing

[0:32:29] <AMajorTom> A moon base is too close to space

[0:40:02] <stantheman_97> is this a form of self-therapy?
[0:40:02] <%Nekros4442> You mentioned Trails in the Sky being on the list. What's the goblin for that one?

[0:40:24] <%valriot> I wasnt listening, ill be honest
[0:40:24] <%tanarath> Is this a subset of the 'It's the Rules' goblin?
[0:40:24] <%Puhff> When's the Goblin stream where you shit in a public bathroom???
[0:40:25] <robosqueeb> not using food in skyrim monkaS
[0:40:25] <%baronblank> It does now yea
[0:40:26] <+BedHome> if i wasnt fucking out of it
[0:40:26] <%CheesesSliced> You're explaining it?
[0:40:36] <$Jaxnos> so the focal point in these games is forcing you to confront the goblins but once it's just a random system in the game you'll have to fight for your life?
[0:40:39] <%solracc25> yes
[0:40:39] <AngryPumpkin1995> If it's a game with mind goblin elements in the background, you will just not notice the goblin in the corner
[0:40:44] <+BedHome> @Puhff thats not a fucking goblin thats a defense
[0:40:46] <$shanna_become_gamer> Sounds like what I do, I want linear improvement with brain things. But it doesnâ€™t always work that way

[0:41:03] <%Takreth> Just play an old school final fantasy and waste every elixer you get
[0:41:06] <+BedHome> THATS A FUKIN BUGBEAR OF A GOBLIN
[0:41:06] <%spitelite> i think that is just a loud goblin and the real goblins are in the background
[0:41:07] <Luizabd> The only item wasted was an item never   used
[0:41:10] <%RayReborne> BUT MY 20 ELIXIRS FOR SEPHIROTH
[0:41:10] <CappuccinoGuil> You need to beat the game with NO consumables in your inventory
[0:41:11] <%Mr_Pylon> I could use a potion, but if I get to the next section I can rest instead and save it...
[0:41:16] <%Broand> You can probably practice that in SMT5
[0:41:21] <%JoshManVGH> If the game isn't mechanically centered around using a thing, it's your natural instinct to NOT use them will act in a more subconscious manner.
[0:41:30] <%cvp5127> like in tales of arise
[0:41:31] <XelanArdel> dont use the pine resin just hit the boss more
[0:41:37] <+rafaelba93> yeah
[0:41:40] <Psyramics> you mean DNC feathers
[0:41:41] <+Catpurnicus> the thing about those items is if you are using them, you are eating shit in that boss fight
[0:41:46] <C0nKeR> In Skyrim I had a goblin for collecting all Books, Letters, Notes and scrolls monkaS
[0:41:54] <Davimotion96> @PatStaresAt How do you deal with Humanity in Dark Souls?
[0:41:57] <Meekest> I forgot it was out because no ones streaming it
[0:41:57] <%AgniBrandt> So that's why Yakuza games aren't a problem
[0:42:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Tales of Arise on Hard mode DEMANDS you use items. It demands you tell party members to USE ITEMS DELIBERATELY
[0:42:02] <%Ziegsy> YOURE filthy
[0:42:02] <AngryPumpkin1995> My way around games with a hard count on consumables is to keep a few in reserve always, even if needed. It's basically demi-goblin
[0:42:02] <$Jaxnos> it's covered in grime and i too wish to be covered in grime
[0:42:02] <+Catpurnicus> like it means your healer is dead
[0:42:03] <$ArcanumArcanum> @XelanArdel but what if I die when I use the Pine Resin? Then it's wasted
[0:42:07] <%Kevlar_Caviar> aw man, i was hoping for a SMTV stream :(
[0:42:10] <%JoshManVGH> That Demon Fusion was something else.
[0:42:12] <+BedHome> Shegani mensai Tin
[0:42:13] <ergulor> does it have a time mechanic?
[0:42:18] <%RayReborne> YEYEYEYE

[0:42:21] <%valriot> No, that part fuckin sucks in Persona. Kids are stupid

[0:42:23] <%RayReborne> csbeastYeyeye csbeastYeyeye
[0:42:26] <PanicSwytch> I just finished Nocturne yesterday! Can't wait to play smt V
[0:42:26] <primaryfire> I just beat smt4 and that does sound right
[0:42:27] <%kyh9> The Persona Bait and Switch
[0:42:28] <Qsmash_> you get right in there in SMT games
[0:42:28] <%Blackleafx> But does it have heart?
[0:42:30] <sirrice77> Yeah you goto school one day and then bam demons
[0:42:32] <%Ziegsy> reverse compendium is sexy af
[0:42:34] <@Ranryu692> I would play SMTV if it didn't look like a Switch game
[0:42:35] <%RayReborne> Wish i could buy it but im broke
[0:42:36] <%kyh9> THENSOUNDTRACK
[0:42:37] <%Broand> @ergulor Nope

[0:42:42] <Arclooper> SMT games are one big dungeon tbh
[0:42:48] <@Ranryu692> also if I wasn't trying to be ready for Endwalker lol
[0:42:50] <%chance_h> But can I romance the androgynous MC?
[0:42:51] <+Catpurnicus> SMTV slime quotes
[0:42:53] <%Mothman007> But Pat, the reviews say that SMT is Persona without the heart!
[0:42:57] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt Yes
[0:42:59] <%ThirdWelles> Pat that sub you had yesterday was an asshole

[0:43:39] <+MajorCrasher> man I sure do hope that people who like persona and people who like smt can both STFU and play the games they like without complaining.
[0:43:40] <%Blackleafx> ASMR Pat
[0:43:43] <$Jaxnos> it has the weirdest framerate differences. like certain animations and transitions are 5 fps on purpose?

[1:10:04] <+StromkoPenguin> Robosexual erasure :(
[1:10:05] <%cvp5127> disney invented gay
[1:10:06] <%SinnerEbru> DISNEY ARE LIARS AND COWARDS
[1:10:07] <%Breaknoon> fufufu
[1:10:07] <%baka_sugoi> But ROBOT
[1:10:10] <+OperatorPlease> it's the only gay character EVERY TIME
[1:10:10] <vile_brand> cause they dont pay attention
[1:10:12] <%Broand> Wasn't Disney back then
[1:10:13] <Tracazoid> He's robosexual
[1:10:13] <+ScrapKingKeita> Gay or European?
[1:10:15] <olaksi> can't hype new gays if you don't bury the old ones
[1:10:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> C3PO is ace for sure
[1:10:16] <julrave> C-3PO is both gay and homophobic
[1:10:16] <+ScrapKingKeita> Is he Gay or European?
[1:10:16] <+BedHome> c3po wasnt gay he was just designed by homophobes for comedy
[1:10:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN?
[1:10:17] <%Breaknoon> robosexual
[1:10:18] <%JoshManVGH> Wasn't that a punchline somewhere "That's right... I'm a gay robot..."
[1:10:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Is he Gay or EUROPE AN
[1:10:20] <+SuperFightinRobot> Oh my god C-3PO and R2D2 are an old gay couple
[1:10:22] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> GAY AND EUROPEAN
[1:10:23] <%BoxNavy> are do
[1:10:23] <%Movemeister> Robosexuals wonâ€™t stand for this
[1:10:23] <+Catpurnicus> robots aren't people in star wars, thats why its ok that they are enslaved
[1:10:24] <@Ranryu692> R Doo
[1:10:25] <joeobo2> cuz no one paid attention all the other times
[1:10:25] <+ALazo> Is he gay, or european
[1:10:25] <%ThirdWelles> Dude disney can barely handle good and evil, do you think they could deal with transumanist romance?
[1:10:26] <missingangle> But they keep doing this. Remember the new Beauty and the Beast and Lofou or whatever the fuck?
[1:10:27] <anAngryHamster> Disney's ninth First Gay Character
[1:10:27] <+BedHome> but thats true about all disney gay couples
[1:10:27] <%CheesesSliced> Metro-robosexual
[1:10:30] <2meito> @Ranryu692 wait, he's not european? /s
[1:10:30] <Dr_Mooose> rdod2
[1:10:33] <%notsoy> because they retroactively make their gay characters NOT gay in order to make it palatable for china/russia
[1:10:36] <%Frost_Quill> If Disney could get away with it they'd claim "This is fiction's first gay character." every time they release something.
[1:10:37] <GarbageNirvana> @JoshManVGH Red vs Blue

[1:10:47] <Explodincatz> R doo P poo
[1:10:48] <Ultralazuli> doesn't that insinuate that you'll be like that with Paige eventually?
[1:10:49] <chimeraxmachina> C3po canâ€™t be gay silly, he sells millions of toys :))
[1:10:50] <%cvp5127> only in certain region
[1:10:50] <%JoshManVGH> Passive Progressive!
[1:10:51] <%solracc25> C-3P0 and R2 are super old married couple
[1:10:51] <%spitelite> except in china
[1:10:57] <missingangle> And then they make sure it's a small role that can be cut out for China
[1:10:58] <AngryPumpkin1995> Disney's 9th gay character that will be removed from the chinese release
[1:10:59] <%JoshManVGH> @garbagenirvana That was it!

[1:12:49] <%ennui_on_me> Satan is the original himbo

[1:20:10] <%coward_man> isn't the thing with cheese that we need a vitamin from it? cause of lack of sunlight

[1:29:40] <%Sotetsu> Did Paige just get up?
[1:29:41] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, what gamepad do you use with your PC? Does it work seamless or is there some setup stuff needed?
[1:29:42] <Rionxgarland> @PatStaresAt any advice for demons souls
[1:29:43] <%Ziegsy> my dog has recently decided chewing is for nerds. she does this every few months and we have to feed her in small amounts
[1:29:45] <%OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt Is time a resource in real life too?
[1:29:51] <%Movemeister> Fat Dog Mendoza has a true successor in Gief

[1:30:52] <%Frost_Quill> Just a few months ago even.
[1:30:55] <%ennui_on_me> SMTV protag's gonna have to rethink his whole deal when he gets a bald spot
[1:30:58] <+Cameoun570> Fight knight coming out at the end of the month you gonna play it
[1:30:59] <AngryPumpkin1995> Don't ever greyhound, not even once

[1:31:49] <+Cameoun570> Iâ€™ve never seen pat with hair I always imagined a pompadour for some reason
[1:31:51] <%ennui_on_me> @Frost_Quill one punch man too

[1:32:03] <%Frost_Quill> Oh this looks good.
[1:32:05] <%X2Eliah> that does look good
[1:32:06] <%Dakuu75> Giving me Iconoclast vibes all ready

[1:32:29] <Ultralazuli> turn on the speedrun clock
[1:32:30] <Treasure_Vault> Meanwhile woolie and reggiee playing some real janky looking fighting game
[1:32:31] <+BedHome> make it louder as a bit

[1:33:52] <+Delenay> she hit the cord and the whole thing dropped
[1:33:56] <@Ranryu692> your DualSense doesn't work wirelessly with your PC?
[1:33:59] <%BlackMage66652> Just don't hit her, Pat
[1:34:02] <marvel877> They break the PS5 controller?
[1:34:03] <%Dakuu75> At least the Bone didn't hit Pat in the balls~
[1:34:06] <nansex> you could make way better art with way less money and time
[1:34:12] <+BedHome> STRATEGIC ANTI STREAM DOG
[1:34:13] <+Delenay> oh paigief hijinks
[1:34:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, are you an Action Girl?
[1:34:17] <%MajorCrasher> I use wireless controller on pc
[1:34:22] <%ennui_on_me> This game generally looks super good though

[1:35:00] <ArmadaGeddra> you can also turn off the time mechanic on normal
[1:35:02] <@Ranryu692> I have the red Dualsense and it just works with bluetooth. I never have any of the problems I had with the DS4
[1:35:02] <%ennui_on_me> The second I saw the time mechanic I turned that shit off
[1:35:06] <%ThirdWelles> Oh does your PC not have integrated Bluetooth?
[1:35:10] <%MajorCrasher> I don't use a dongle I use DS4
[1:35:22] <%Glass_Muffin> ds4 is great

[1:35:58] <olaksi> I just bought a wifi/BT card, the dongle work horrible

[1:36:10] <+redthebaron> tap tap tap
[1:36:12] <%spitelite> my pc's case fucks up the bluetooth so it might as well not have it
[1:36:12] <%ennui_on_me> @NoxyenaToo yep
[1:36:13] <jetstreamlove_R> Yo this looks sick
[1:36:20] <+BedHome> oh great, he runs now
[1:36:23] <%X2Eliah> This is a 2D elden-ring-like
[1:36:23] <stevenellis386> more like a zelda-like
[1:36:26] <jetstreamlove_R> is this on steam right now?
[1:36:34] <%BlackMage66652> I this a catgirl
[1:36:36] <whycantipostasguest> throw box
[1:36:38] <+Catpurnicus> lot of Hyper Light Drifter influence here
[1:36:41] <%Sotetsu> I'd like to see a mind goblin playthrough of Chrono Trigger where you use items as often as possible.
[1:36:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @jetstreamlove_R yes, I think it's also on game pass, maybe?
[1:36:43] <%X2Eliah> booooo
[1:36:45] <%twistedj3ster> awww
[1:36:45] <%Nekros4442> nice try
[1:36:45] <+NoxyenaToo> @NoxyenaToo I love that I could tell that just from the limited heals
[1:36:48] <OvaltineDream> confirmed
[1:36:48] <%ennui_on_me> It's a zelda-like with souls combat
[1:36:49] <+SuperFightinRobot> Damn
[1:36:53] <+redthebaron> damn it
[1:37:05] <+BedHome> when you think about it that feature is incredibly unimersive
[1:37:15] <jetstreamlove_R> @CappuccinoGuil I'mma check it out now!
[1:37:18] <stevenellis386> yea see
[1:37:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @NoxyenaToo the heals aren't limited, you'll see
[1:37:24] <%Nekros4442> she cute
[1:37:24] <%Dakuu75> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN~!!!
[1:37:28] <marvel877> Sounds more like Sonic music
[1:37:29] <Latija> that's a woolie girl
[1:37:31] <%BlackMage66652> booba
[1:37:36] <+BedHome> this is pretty but its also instantly giving me a headache
[1:37:38] <GarbageNirvana> That's a neat animation on the hair
[1:37:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt This game has MASSIVE zelda inspirations. From a bunch of their games.
[1:37:42] <+Catpurnicus> thats a hyper light slash
[1:37:44] <+doe3879> the eye really bothers me...
[1:37:45] <%Dakuu75> 100% a woolie-gal
[1:37:51] <Mudstone12> oh nice the main charcter is PoC
[1:37:52] <+uberspeedster> Read text on weapon?
[1:37:53] <%VictorVonLouche> That puppet animation looks jaaank
[1:37:53] <%X2Eliah> Ok the torso just sliding up and down on the inventory screen is creepy af
[1:37:57] <%Sotetsu> What mind goblin is Pat overcoming in this one?
[1:37:59] <+redthebaron> it sounds good
[1:38:03] <%greasypete00> game feels really good
[1:38:06] <jetstreamlove_R> Yo this 20 bucks on steam, it's a steal!
[1:38:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Dakuu75 this game seems engineered for Woolie. It just gets more Woolie-esque the further you play
[1:38:19] <%ennui_on_me> @Sotetsu there's a mechanic where every character has a time limit and will die when they hit it
[1:38:20] <marvel877> Oh, great, stamina on weapon swings. Yay.
[1:38:20] <+BedHome> oh shit that IS a good price hell yea
[1:38:27] <+redthebaron> @Sotetsu time itself
[1:38:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @VictorVonLouche its emulating classical sprite puppet animation from early 90s
[1:38:33] <GarbageNirvana> This game's also on gamepass if I'm not mistaken
[1:38:34] <%greasypete00> oh wow what could that be
[1:38:40] <mothdude> robutts
[1:38:51] <%Sotetsu> @ennui_on_me fmgJAHN Holy crap, that sounds terrifying
[1:38:51] <%greasypete00> do the parry also
[1:39:01] <%MrWurmles> Was that a key near the bottom of the room before last?
[1:39:10] <%valriot> TRY 0451
[1:39:12] <jeppeww> is this made by the hyperlight drifter guys?
[1:39:16] <%Dakuu75> 9 times outa 10 when Pat plays some game I never heard of, I'm like, "Welp, this looks cool, guess I gotta buy it now."
[1:39:16] <jetstreamlove_R> Soundtrack is giving me Jak & Daxter vibes, I miss that game so much!
[1:39:18] <+BedHome> he did
[1:39:18] <%OG_M_Bison> This sound track SLAPS
[1:39:24] <%ennui_on_me> @Sotetsu and there are very limited resources to boost people's time limit. So you have to pick who you save, or if you want to use it on yourself.
[1:39:30] <+BedHome> @valriot thats the first thing he did
[1:39:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Sotetsu you can turn it off for a first playthrough. And also, it means this game is designed around speedrunning. You can beat it in like, an hour.
[1:39:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> SLAP THAT BASS
[1:39:40] <%valriot> fuk
[1:39:41] <captain_elsewhere> very metroid music n sounds
[1:39:42] <%Dakuu75> @jetstreamlove_R doodShake
[1:40:05] <%valriot> filthy ass megadrive sound chip
[1:40:14] <%Alazull> reminds me of og FF7 music
[1:40:31] <%Dakuu75> STORY~!
[1:40:33] <jetstreamlove_R> I would kill for Jak & Daxter remake or spiritual succesor it was the goat!
[1:40:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Woolie went into mass production?
[1:40:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat's face is gonna block something nobody where he puts his cam, huh?
[1:40:43] <@Ranryu692> those are some thick glasses
[1:40:59] <cthulu_fearlock> BlackLivesMatter
[1:41:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHADOW CENSORSHIP
[1:41:03] <ExpressNode> What about this game gives him the goblins?
[1:41:05] <%blastyoboots> yay black protagonist!
[1:41:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @doc_ock_rokc the ONLY thing this game doesn't have for woolie is punch weapons. He can't play a punch girl. But I think there IS a punch girl character.
[1:41:08] <stantheman_97> the hot girl clone vats
[1:41:11] <%Dakuu75> "I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle."
[1:41:12] <%BoxNavy> the gamne or the choese
[1:41:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> I fucking love they kept her name as Raquel in English.
[1:41:35] <GarbageNirvana> @ExpressNode It's the thing in parentheses in the stream title
[1:41:40] <jetstreamlove_R> yo these cutscenes are top quality!
[1:41:57] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:42:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hey, y'all like DRead?
[1:42:03] <+Pachi3000> monkaS
[1:42:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Here's a Dread.
[1:42:08] <+OperatorPlease> WELL
[1:42:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> SAX
[1:42:09] <%Movemeister> PogChamp
[1:42:10] <ExpressNode> @garbagenirvana Oh fuck I can't read! Thank you though
[1:42:12] <%BoxNavy> you better run girlboss!
[1:42:12] <%greasypete00> KILL
[1:42:13] <%KetsuoTaberu> fuck that
[1:42:14] <+redthebaron> love his feet
[1:42:16] <%ennui_on_me> super toby fox music
[1:42:17] <+Pachi3000> Yo we Dreadin
[1:42:17] <%dasmause> that thing is creepy
[1:42:18] <%tanarath> Pat, could you move your streaming camera position to the top of the stream? Maybe the top right?
[1:42:19] <%baka_sugoi> OH HE A COMIN
[1:42:20] <+redthebaron> look at him go
[1:42:22] <+OperatorPlease> it's not faster than you but it MIGHT AS WELL BE
[1:42:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> unidentified biomass was my nickname in highscool
[1:42:23] <+polothegreatest> Goomma
[1:42:29] <+RelikaNox> oh god fuck this noise
[1:42:30] <Shwepie> Time as a resource? Shouldn't he play N64 Majora's Mask?
[1:42:36] <AbnormalVoid> this is fine
[1:42:47] <2meito> party memebers as consumables
[1:42:53] <+RelikaNox> I would have immediately turned off the game upon seeing that, that stuff scares the hell out of me LUL
[1:42:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> That gave big Aou Oni vibes
[1:42:54] <+Pachi3000> NaviBot
[1:42:55] <%Logoth_> robot nips
[1:42:55] <ExpressNode> Majora's mask is piss easy though
[1:42:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ravi
[1:42:57] <%Dakuu75> her face just screams "I'm so sick of this shit." lol
[1:42:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'm not sorry
[1:42:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Shwepie it's worse. This is more like Dead Rising than Majora's. Every NPC has a death clock.
[1:43:05] <+SuperFightinRobot> Time to reclass to scholar
[1:43:25] <Profmcstevie> Majora is time management
[1:43:28] <bigshedman> It is in this too. Just restart the game Kappa
[1:43:32] <Shwepie> @CappuccinoGuil Makes sense.
[1:43:37] <%SinnerEbru> so time as a resource is more like a payhologic?
[1:43:38] <Latija> unkindled ash
[1:43:47] <+polothegreatest> MM is easy if played multiple times LUL
[1:43:50] <LeninCake> you should try that nuclear bunker game, where you grab your family and all the stuff you need in 60 sec
[1:43:54] <LeninCake> for time goblins
[1:43:55] <%BoxNavy> robot...
[1:43:57] <%Dakuu75> YEAAAAAAAH~!!!! I'm into it!
[1:43:59] <%Operative5639> art is sick
[1:44:00] <+Pachi3000> I'm gay and I have no memory
[1:44:06] <+redthebaron> look at this lore
[1:44:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SinnerEbru the difference is Pathologic expects people will die. Here, you are encouraged with saving everyone.
[1:44:20] <%doomunderthestairs> oh boy
[1:44:29] <%ConLin_Arts_> Chaos Gief
[1:44:31] <bigshedman> @Pachi3000 Is that the sequel to I have no mouth and I must scream? LUL
[1:44:34] <%VictorVonLouche> Seems to confirm hand holding caused the apocalypse.
[1:44:36] <BoxNavy> :)
[1:44:37] <ExpressNode> Tape the floor wires!
[1:44:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> Quien Soy?!
[1:44:38] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[1:44:42] <%doomunderthestairs> betterah
[1:44:43] <%BoxNavy> betteruhhhh
[1:44:44] <OvaltineDream> bewbs
[1:44:49] <%ennui_on_me> pathologic is like, it's impossible to do the right thing. this is like, try your best! You can do it!
[1:44:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think also every character in this uses she/her or they/them pronouns? Like, there are no he/hims.
[1:44:53] <Profmcstevie> Train your dog in I.T then
[1:44:56] <+Pachi3000> she flapp
[1:44:59] <Treasure_Vault> stop throwing bones in the office
[1:45:00] <%smoothwood07> In theatre and film they use rugs to cover wires
[1:45:00] <M0untain_wolf> Flapping
[1:45:05] <LuxyDoodle> So is that just the shading on her shirt or is this fairy STACKED?
[1:45:05] <%ennui_on_me> does navi have jiggle physics
[1:45:08] <ExpressNode> Unless it's carpet
[1:45:11] <M0untain_wolf> endlessly flappy
[1:45:12] <+Pachi3000> nom
[1:45:13] <%ThirdWelles> "but your fault-tuh"
[1:45:18] <jumpyhugs> suspend the wire with a complex series of fishing line guy wires
[1:45:19] <%SinnerEbru> @cappuccinoguil oooh yeah that hits way different
[1:45:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ennui_on_me it's supposed to be light, but... yeah looks like tig ol' bitties LUL
[1:45:42] <Brother_Coduss> why does the fairy have boobjiggle
[1:45:48] <%BoxNavy> rayquil
[1:46:02] <LuxyDoodle> @Brother_Coduss why don't you?
[1:46:06] <%Logoth_> Dayquill
[1:46:15] <%ThirdWelles> The Haltar
[1:46:16] <M0untain_wolf> OOOFF
[1:46:21] <+Delenay> bad friends joke
[1:46:21] <+Catpurnicus> boomer joke
[1:46:23] <%doomunderthestairs> downrighrt awful
[1:46:24] <Brother_Coduss> because I have no boobs
[1:46:27] <GarbageNirvana> -2
[1:46:36] <%Dakuu75> this game is 2 gigs, I downloaded in like, a second.
[1:46:38] <LuxyDoodle> @Brother_Coduss I'm so sorry
[1:46:46] <@Ranryu692> Sigh
[1:46:55] <+Catpurnicus> is there a parry in this game
[1:47:01] <MelfinaStarwind> ooo love this style fhaeO
[1:47:05] <whycantipostasguest> yes
[1:47:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so where's the time resource part of this game?
[1:47:20] <MelfinaStarwind> @Zaphire_Saucypants was just about to ask that too
[1:47:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think it's don't get hit and timer.
[1:47:24] <%ennui_on_me> @Zaphire_Saucypants every character has a time limit until they die
[1:47:25] <whycantipostasguest> time resource doesnt start until the tutorials done
[1:47:26] <%thedankestmeeme> early stream?
[1:47:30] <GarbageNirvana> Damn that thing hit hard
[1:47:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ennui_on_me ahhh
[1:47:39] <%greasypete00> @Zaphire_Saucypants i think it starts after where the demo ends
[1:47:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, can you heal under 100% syringe?
[1:47:53] <%greencapps> Kinda looks like Hyper Light
[1:47:53] <MelfinaStarwind> @ennui_on_me omg sounds stressful fhaeS
[1:47:54] <Profmcstevie> The time resource is every single character player and NPC runs on batteries, there are finite batteries :)
[1:47:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Iiiiinteresting.
[1:48:11] <+redthebaron> that is nice
[1:48:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> No damage, because the devs love you.
[1:48:19] <%TheGreatSkenardo> TheGreatSkenardo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! wait this is just hyper-light drifter
[1:48:20] <+Catpurnicus> did that one attack do 4 pips of damage?
[1:48:24] <MelfinaStarwind> I can see why it's a mind goblin game in that case damn
[1:48:34] <%X2Eliah> Souls
[1:48:34] <GarbageNirvana> So I heard folks comparing this to Hyper Light Drifter
[1:48:39] <%BoxNavy> eat em
[1:48:41] <%spitelite> its not a bonfire its a grace
[1:48:43] <%Logoth_> chisps
[1:48:46] <+CapnClassix> Automata
[1:48:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TheGreatSkenardo Hyper-light drifter camera with more platforming and being a metroidvania.
[1:48:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, I definitely wouldn't play this. Being timed stresses me the fuck out. And then you tie it into story shit? Nuh-uh.
[1:48:54] <TrollKing96> We Nier now.
[1:48:55] <cthulu_fearlock> crisps
[1:48:55] <AbnormalVoid> pringles
[1:48:55] <%Logoth_> popato chisps
[1:48:56] <+Pachi3000> I require chipp
[1:49:08] <%Logoth_> Its more like Zelda with sequence breaking than Metroid
[1:49:08] <+Catpurnicus> its more horny than HLD
[1:49:10] <Badgerconda_> upgrade your chips, from lays to doritos
[1:49:17] <%dasmause> wheres the time limit here?
[1:49:19] <Profmcstevie> "it's da Hyper Light Drifter" it's just a camera angle with real time combat guys LuvUok
[1:49:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Zaphire_Saucypants you can turn it off, no problem.
[1:49:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dasmause hasn't started yet
[1:49:36] <M0untain_wolf> scrraps
[1:49:37] <LuxyDoodle> @dasmause not in the tutorial area
[1:49:37] <marvel877> better rain than the GTA Remasters
[1:49:39] <+Catpurnicus> nah that sword swing and sound is pretty on point
[1:49:45] <+polothegreatest> Its not gta de rain
[1:49:46] <%dasmause> oooh
[1:49:50] <GarbageNirvana> I will say this looks more up my alley than Hyper Light Drifter is, something about the way that game controlled put me off
[1:49:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @CappuccinoGuil So wait, the timed feature can be shut off in options or what?
[1:49:59] <M0untain_wolf> big combo
[1:50:04] <AbnormalVoid> the running animation speed to movement speed feels weird
[1:50:15] <%ennui_on_me> yeah you can turn off the time mechanic if you want
[1:50:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Zaphire_Saucypants when the game teaches you the time mechanic, it offers an option to turn it off.
[1:50:26] <+Catpurnicus> HLD is about knowing when to use GUN
[1:50:27] <GarbageNirvana> Also I really dig this game's sound design
[1:50:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hm...maybe I might play it then. Cuz it does look cool.
[1:50:51] <GarbageNirvana> Isn't the time mechanic the core conceit of this game's design
[1:50:58] <GarbageNirvana> Seems like it's missing the point to turn it off
[1:50:59] <M0untain_wolf> Boss doors must have a big ol'eye
[1:51:00] <ExpressNode> So what's the time mechanic in this game? Is it just how fast you get to events in the game that gives different results?
[1:51:00] <%Logoth_> BORK
[1:51:04] <%ennui_on_me> Not really.
[1:51:19] <LuxyDoodle> That bark sounded like a coug
[1:51:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Zaphire_Saucypants the time mechanic is there more for the story and replay. You can save everyone, so when you see an NPC who has less than an hour IRL to live, you know you can save them.
[1:51:23] <+SuperFightinRobot> With regards to your own attacks, Bigger than sprite >>>>> smaller than sprite
[1:51:24] <%Logoth_> Part of what lends the game its atmostphere is the time limit
[1:51:42] <%BoxNavy> vineChatspin
[1:51:43] <%cade_calrayn> gieferton craves violence
[1:51:43] <mothdude> There is a resource you can find that gives you more time on the clock, but you have to choose who to give it to.
[1:51:48] <+Catpurnicus> thats a zelda
[1:51:49] <captain_elsewhere> zalod
[1:51:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> The devs LOVE Zelda, BTW LUL
[1:51:55] <%Dakuu75> you got a graham cracker lol
[1:51:56] <+fetrigon> 3 npcs have already died while doing that puzzle pat. hurry up.
[1:52:01] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:52:15] <+Catpurnicus> ok thats great
[1:52:20] <%tanarath> Zelda x Nier Automata x Dark souls seems interesting
[1:52:22] <+polothegreatest> hyaat
[1:52:29] <+Catpurnicus> slide around in the spin attack pose
[1:52:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> @tanarath with metroidvania level design.
[1:52:51] <+SuperFightinRobot> Could you imagine if it pulled a Dead Rising and just popped up with "X NPC died!" every few minutes?
[1:52:57] <marvel877> Is there anyway to increase the stamina bar for more swings/dodges?
[1:53:05] <%RealThiele> hyper light souler
[1:53:14] <+fetrigon> @superfightinrobot omfg LUL
[1:53:16] <whycantipostasguest> yes
[1:53:39] <GarbageNirvana> get the arc charge for the destiny raid
[1:53:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SuperFightinRobot I haven't seen far, but it might have that.
[1:53:43] <vile_brand> god this really is zelda
[1:53:46] <+SuperFightinRobot> Hey, Listen
[1:53:59] <+SuperFightinRobot> Oh god you are right, it is not too late
[1:54:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I DO love me some Zelda...
[1:54:05] <jetstreamlove_R> Zelda meets DS meets Dead Rising time limit gimmick
[1:54:10] <%Logoth_> Yes, you can parry in this game
[1:54:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> @marvel877 chips might do it? they seem to work like Automata.
[1:54:16] <%Logoth_> You can parry any attack actually
[1:54:16] <@Fuggins4U> sure bud, blame the buttons
[1:54:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> Guess what? There's perfect parries in this.
[1:54:33] <%Logoth_> parries are VERY USEFUL
[1:54:53] <jetstreamlove_R> yo become sekiro
[1:55:02] <%RealThiele> we puzzlin
[1:55:13] <%ThirdWelles> On the middle one too, then ride it up

[1:56:35] <Rancaliber_> An absolute mastermind at work, folks.
[1:56:37] <%X2Eliah> so far this game looks really chill
[1:56:42] <jetstreamlove_R> Become Jack The Ripper mode!
[1:57:29] <%Logoth_> get the stinky green goo
[1:57:48] <Dianaillumani> Is this the stress game with the batteries?
[1:57:50] <%Logoth_> A perfect parry has a better effect
[1:58:02] <anAngryHamster> Why use gun when sword do trick?
[1:58:03] <%CapnBeefs> What is this?
[1:58:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Perfect parries stun AND crate crit opportunities???
[1:58:21] <%greasypete00> you can also do an immediate follow-up on a perfect parry
[1:58:29] <sennoh> parries are meaty in this game
[1:58:30] <GarbageNirvana> @anAngryHamster swordtrickgunsword
[1:58:32] <%RealThiele> 7 bullets?
[1:58:34] <%Bmrandfriends> Sounding like a real patriot pat
[1:58:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, guns have Gears of War style active reload
[1:58:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> gun
[1:58:53] <+polothegreatest> gears reload?
[1:59:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @polothegreatest yup
[1:59:05] <%Logoth_> Yes, gears reload
[1:59:08] <%ennui_on_me> Every single mechanic in this game is taken from another game and it all works pretty well together
[1:59:15] <+polothegreatest> doodCrazy doodCrazy doodCrazy
[1:59:24] <%Logoth_> Sorry to backseat, but this is a confusing red herring. Don't worry about that door right now.
[1:59:29] <%RealThiele> only 3rd impact can open this door
[1:59:40] <+PenmanLupine> why does that TV fairy got booba?
[1:59:50] <%Logoth_> Not sure why the devs implied you could open it now
[1:59:55] <+SuperFightinRobot> Kinda reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter
[2:00:24] <OvaltineDream> @PenmanLupine It's better that way
[2:00:46] <%ennui_on_me> robots gotta have booba, it's the law
[2:01:49] <%RealThiele> the parry knockback is a bit much having to walk to do the followup is weird
[2:01:52] <%MrWurmles> Got to love how "lucky
[2:01:53] <+polothegreatest> Its for later upgrades doodLUL
[2:02:04] <%MrWurmles> "lucky" is being with those parries. :P
[2:02:18] <%BoxNavy> elmos closet
[2:02:36] <felinepoetry> Elmo has his own closet?
[2:02:39] <%cade_calrayn> i'd shop at Elmo's Closet
[2:02:41] <%ennui_on_me> remember Pat, it's a metroidvania
[2:02:50] <%BoxNavy> elmo has a shoe closet i guess
[2:02:52] <%Bmrandfriends> U should be used to that by now
[2:02:56] <%BoxNavy> for hsi shoes
[2:02:56] <Teyaric> Didnt Need To Drop after the first brick. There's another over
[2:02:58] <%ennui_on_me> and you just got an upgrade
[2:02:58] <%basswizard11> knock the gargoyles off the chruch?
[2:02:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> Go left?
[2:03:08] <%MooseIsGoose> MooseIsGoose subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! I wanted to ask are any of the dead rising games in your mind goblin game list. If not is there a reason why they seem like they would be prime contenders for it.

[2:04:52] <2meito> negative kromer???
[2:04:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TheGreatSkenardo timer hasn't started.
[2:04:55] <Teyaric> Kind of pointless while the Navi is still there. She dies first, if I recall from the numbers.
[2:04:57] <%cade_calrayn> what happened?
[2:04:59] <%TheGreatSkenardo> oof that makes it hurt
[2:05:02] <+uberspeedster> YOUR SOULS
[2:05:09] <%thedankestmeeme> wait this game looks interesting
[2:05:15] <%RealThiele> navi why you got such big booba
[2:05:17] <cthulu_fearlock> stonk go down? TearGlove
[2:05:47] <+Moaradin> i heard this game was super good
[2:06:18] <%Logoth_> I only ever used the spin attack after a perfect parry
[2:06:18] <jetstreamlove_R> death lurks at evert corner
[2:06:23] <%BoxNavy> vompire
[2:07:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> So far, this has: Zelda, Gears of War, Metroidvania, Souls, Hyperlight Drifter DNA

[2:08:12] <RantingRavager> wow, Elden Ring looks more pixel-y than before
[2:08:24] <%VictorVonLouche> Pat are you blind to their guns?
[2:08:35] <2meito> neat enemy
[2:08:35] <%ennui_on_me> this enemy has a super bloodborne vibe in his moveset imo
[2:08:35] <jetstreamlove_R> speedrunner licking their lips and cleaning their hands looking at this game
[2:08:45] <%SWFanatic> psaBlind
[2:09:08] <GarbageNirvana> It's not the guns you really have to worry about, it's the bullets
[2:09:31] <GarbageNirvana> Like in the Metroid Dread
[2:09:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[2:10:21] <%SWFanatic> is this links awakening on the switch?
[2:10:27] <%greasypete00> you can parry most things
[2:10:32] <%ennui_on_me> You can parry damn near anything
[2:10:35] <%VictorVonLouche> PAt you missed the progress
[2:10:42] <%ennui_on_me> if there's a red flash it's parryable
[2:11:01] <TrollKing96> Was that "Auto Blaster" a chip or a gun?
[2:11:18] <%ennui_on_me> map, pat
[2:11:19] <Teyaric> theres a second platform after the one you dropped down from
[2:11:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TrollKing96 blueprint
[2:11:51] <Teyaric> huh well fuck my eyes then
[2:11:57] <GarbageNirvana> dig up
[2:12:08] <%skizzuto> Seems like bullets don't do the bonus damage after a parry like the sword swings do
[2:12:14] <%VictorVonLouche> Very
[2:12:22] <%Logoth_> check the map?
[2:12:30] <Teyaric> oh, duh, the platform you drop down for the first step - get on and shoot again to lift it up
[2:12:31] <%ennui_on_me> how can this be
[2:12:34] <%SharkMissile> Cool, never seen this game before
[2:12:38] <%VictorVonLouche> Oh jees
[2:12:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skizzuto when you parry a melee attack, you stun the enemy. That's where the crit comes from
[2:12:40] <%SWFanatic> baba
[2:12:46] <%basswizard11> knock the gargoyal down?
[2:13:15] <%VictorVonLouche> He can play metroid dread but not his game it seems.
[2:13:18] <SilverFaustX> i just beat margit in elden ring
[2:13:19] <%VictorVonLouche> this
[2:13:19] <%skizzuto> try the door that costs money?
[2:13:22] <%Agami23> have you tried charge attacking the door?
[2:13:25] <%spitelite> can you go in the fallen tower
[2:13:48] <%tanarath> Shoot the garhoyle?
[2:14:01] <SilverFaustX> yes
[2:14:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> Can you go on the left? There's an opening on the leftmost room.
[2:14:21] <%VictorVonLouche> Try going to the part that wanted the time stop in a cinematic
[2:14:24] <@Ranryu692> I'm glad you're not pre-recording this, then
[2:14:27] <+AlucardX60> Hi Pat. What is today's mind goblin?
[2:14:33] <%Logoth_> I think you go down from here
[2:14:34] <%SWFanatic> we're not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in there with us
[2:14:36] <mastermidget23> oh cool, this game is in my top two post apocalyptic robot lesbian samurai with white hair games.
[2:14:36] <orphancrippler_> skip ball exposure
[2:14:43] <whycantipostasguest> down then right
[2:14:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @AlucardX60 time as a resource.
[2:14:44] <%ennui_on_me> we're not even going to get to the mindgoblins at this rate
[2:15:06] <+AlucardX60> @CappuccinoGuil That is a mind goblin for sure.
[2:15:08] <%justcallmebobplease> Have you tried not being blind, or getting gud?
[2:15:11] <%VictorVonLouche> For the love of all 1 map down
[2:15:11] <TetraBanshee> No Goblin is the New Goblin
[2:15:22] <%ennui_on_me> if this is the speed this game's gonna go at, everybody's gonna die

[2:32:07] <%tanarath> oh.....
[2:32:18] <%cvp5127> till what?
[2:32:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @tanarath each character has their own timer too
[2:32:27] <+fetrigon> pat half the village is already dead. wtf PunOko
[2:32:28] <whycantipostasguest> i think its like 2 seconds per minute
[2:32:29] <%solracc25> the hearts
[2:32:29] <GarbageNirvana> A little over 21 in-game days
[2:32:30] <orphancrippler_> till lavis
[2:32:31] <M0untain_wolf> time before rampants
[2:32:31] <%RealThiele> till hollowing i suppose
[2:32:34] <Teyaric> @BoxNavy Wait till you see how tiny the time limit for the companion fairy is. It's comparatively miniscule.
[2:32:34] <bigshedman> So, how we all doin' today?
[2:32:35] <%BoxNavy> til the end monkaS
[2:32:40] <%tanarath> Oh god, this is... oh, I can see why Pat noped out of this, christ.
[2:32:41] <orphancrippler_> lavos*
[2:32:41] <cthulu_fearlock> only 511 hours left, oof may as well start over completely the goblin says
[2:32:41] <+AdumPlaze> 53 raiders from AdumPlaze have joined! 
[2:32:42] <$CrownlessKitty> finish the game or else
[2:32:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cvp5127 if a character's timer gets to 0, they become unsighted. Basically, monster
[2:32:48] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype
[2:32:48] <%RealThiele> wooo brb raid
[2:32:54] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy WutFace
[2:32:57] <%Pappajimbo> Till the go robo hollow
[2:32:58] <ArcOfDeath> yea.. the other characters all have far less time than you
[2:33:00] <ExpressNode> So about 8 hours if the 511 minutes is accurate?
[2:33:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cthulu_fearlock eveyr NPC has an individual timer
[2:33:06] <%BoxNavy> hullo raiders :)
[2:33:11] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> TombRaid
[2:33:25] <ArcOfDeath> some of the random npcs around town have like 12 hours
[2:33:33] <whycantipostasguest> pat gets raided in the bathroom
[2:33:37] <cthulu_fearlock> oh
[2:33:38] <%basswizard11> this game looks awesome and fun... but this timer mechanic is making me not even want to try it
[2:33:39] <%andrewofbob> Well, at least the raid isn't during the outro
[2:33:46] <%basswizard11> im getting anxiety
[2:33:54] <%tanarath> What's the time for the golden ending?
[2:33:54] <bigshedman> @basswizard11 You can turn it off, no worries.
[2:33:56] <+Pengy9> kamaDance
[2:33:57] <%RealThiele> wonder if you can increase the timer
[2:33:57] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:34:00] <whycantipostasguest> you can turn the timer off
[2:34:08] <%basswizard11> @bigshedman phew
[2:34:15] <%RealThiele> oh no timer, well that solves that
[2:34:20] <%BoxNavy> thank god you can
[2:34:22] <ArcOfDeath> yea, exploration mode is great
[2:34:28] <ArcOfDeath> cause exploring the world is actually fun
[2:34:31] <cthulu_fearlock> just turn off goblin
[2:34:51] <%basswizard11> yea... games like this i love digging around in every nook and cranny
[2:34:54] <+fetrigon> @basswizard11 I guess a silver lining is that the game helps learn more about your anxiety works LUL
[2:35:03] <+fetrigon> *how
[2:35:21] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah for as cool as the timer is for the game, it's really something that would push like 90% of players away so it makes sense for it to be a toggle
[2:35:26] <%basswizard11> @fetrigon yea true... im well aware of how it works though
[2:35:30] <Teyaric> @whycantipostasguest Nope. You can "just" increase it. But it's still "ONE HUNDRED HOURS TILL I DIE" under everyone's dialog boxes.
[2:36:04] <mothdude> @RealThiele Basically there are items you find around the world that you can give people to increase their lifespan. So you gotta make choices on who you want to live.
[2:36:30] <stevenellis386> so im midway throught his game. What happens if I run out of time? Game Over?
[2:36:43] <ArcOfDeath> yea its a game over
[2:37:07] <stevenellis386> yea should've chose the explorer option
[2:37:09] <+fetrigon> interesting way to incentivise exploration.
[2:37:14] <%ennui_on_me> reminds me of the Prinny games' whole deal of "you have this many lives to beat the game and then that's it"
[2:37:25] <%BoxNavy> chjbRandompictureonmyPC
[2:37:30] <%ennui_on_me> @stevenellis386 can't you turn that on in the options?
[2:37:34] <ArcOfDeath> there is another way to get time if you wanna go that route
[2:37:41] <mothdude> There is a special npc who can give you more time if you get close to death, but there are consequences.
[2:37:57] <Teyaric> @stevenellis386 explorer mode just gives you more time on the clock
[2:38:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ennui_on_me pretty sure they give you the option no matter the difficulty, right at the moment you walk out the door
[2:38:08] <ArcOfDeath> explorer mode stops the timer
[2:38:12] <stevenellis386> @ennui_on_me yea I think I can, now that you mention it.
[2:39:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> This game was fucking engineered for Woolie, s2g LUL
[2:39:49] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah I'd love to see him give it a go
[2:39:59] <%maenos2> kzxAaltoBanger
[2:40:11] <%BoxNavy> moon2JAM
[2:40:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ennui_on_me Brazilian game devs don't fuck around when we put our mind to it LUL
[2:41:49] <stevenellis386> @fetrigon to me, its kinda discouraging because I really want to take my time and explore but I'm put under this perpetual time limit, so i feel like im being rushed (but ayy thats what explorer mode is for)
[2:43:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> @stevenellis386 I like to think of the timer as more of a new game plus incentive. This game seems designed around speedrunning and breaking progression. Go as fast as possible and save everyone.
[2:43:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How's the game going? Did he puke yet?
[2:43:31] <%ennui_on_me> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid he just got to the goblin element
[2:43:43] <%ennui_on_me> and had to run to the bathroom
[2:43:45] <%ennui_on_me> so probably
[2:44:45] <%maenos2> I hope he didn't fall in
[2:44:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat saw the timer and thought "I'm gonna shit my pants, oh fuck"
[2:45:04] <GarbageNirvana> Part of me wants Pat to come back and the timer's advanced by two days
[2:45:13] <%justcallmebobplease> I bet that the timer hit like a mac truck, after the anxiety of getting lost in the tutorial zone.
[2:45:23] <whycantipostasguest> he ran out of time
[2:45:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Like I don't have his goblins but I can see the goblin fuel of that.
[2:46:30] <%andrewofbob> Can you not just approach it like a time loop game where the loop is massive?
[2:46:59] <ArcOfDeath> not really, cause eventually all the shops will be dead
[2:47:30] <%andrewofbob> Just hit New Game for a new "loop"
[2:47:49] <stevenellis386> @andrewofbob thats my gripe, I have no idea if the progress of items and weapons carry over.
[2:47:54] <%ennui_on_me> well that would take a lot of the much more limited real world time
[2:48:33] <theredfox930000> you can turn off the timer if you want to learn the game that way
[2:48:54] <stevenellis386> really? how?
[2:49:10] <mothdude> I didn't try out the new game plus but there's two different types. One brings over more then the other from what I remember.
[2:49:17] <marvel877> was AFK for a bit, we on bathroom break or something else happen?
[2:49:25] <%ennui_on_me> bathroom
[2:49:30] <%maenos2> bathroom
[2:49:32] <bigshedman> Probably under options, or maybe it'll give you a prompt after the tutorial
[2:49:35] <theredfox930000> go to options you can even adjust enemy damage
[2:49:37] <%maenos2> though he has been gone a while
[2:49:38] <%andrewofbob> We on bathroom break AND we got raided
[2:49:42] <%SWFanatic> So...hes in the shower now?
[2:49:47] <%baka_sugoi> Taking a long PISS
[2:49:48] <+acridpaladin> did paige leave the seat up so now pat's stuck?
[2:49:54] <%ennui_on_me> let's face it, all the raiders have left by now
[2:50:02] <%SWFanatic> oh he's emptying he paint bucket?
[2:50:05] <stevenellis386> @theredfox930000 yea figured
[2:50:16] <%BoxNavy> hi :)
[2:50:26] <%baka_sugoi> ye

[2:50:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:50:33] <%RealThiele> wah
[2:50:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Oh, gawd, there he is.
[2:50:40] <%baka_sugoi> BIG POOP
[2:50:43] <%BoxNavy> owned
[2:50:45] <%andrewofbob> Toilet combo
[2:50:48] <%SWFanatic> nice
[2:50:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> is it half full or empty?
[2:50:53] <bigshedman> Water Kappa
[2:50:54] <%RealThiele> pissed his pants
[2:50:55] <stevenellis386> nice
[2:50:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How could Paige miss you? You're really loud??
[2:51:02] <+tempestzephyr> WET PAT
[2:51:02] <%BoxNavy> the balls too? :(
[2:51:03] <%Djinnazz> Miss you? Wasn't she just here?
[2:51:07] <%ennui_on_me> pissed and shidded and cummed
[2:51:18] <%SWFanatic> but shes blind so she cant hear
[2:51:32] <+ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt I was so interested in this game, but then I heard the podcast where u talked about that timing shit. I'm never touching that game. ever
[2:51:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it also seems to pause when in the map
[2:51:39] <Slim_Lipid> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid you vastly overestimate the capability of paige's organs
[2:51:50] <bigshedman> @ikantreeed You can turn the timer off, no worries.
[2:52:03] <Explodincatz> they even look like ALttP crystals
[2:52:16] <+ikantreeed> @bigshedman really??? oh that change things
[2:52:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid You're right, they are all failing at this point, but it's like that SImpson's bit, about the Three Stooges bit, where they all get stuck in a door
[2:52:30] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you missed a raid from AdumPlaze
[2:52:35] <+ikantreeed> i H A T E being timed in a game. I HAAATE it sooo much
[2:52:36] <GarbageNirvana> Seems like you could have broken that glass for gun
[2:52:39] <%crimsonharvest> ok im here what is this shit
[2:52:56] <stevenellis386> this game has a nice ost
[2:53:08] <+Punchasaur> this botw music
[2:53:09] <+ikantreeed> Majora's mask my fav zelda tho NotLikeThis
[2:53:21] <$CrownlessKitty> oh jeez, iris doesnt have much left
[2:53:23] <bigshedman> Hey there ya go!
[2:53:28] <%crimsonharvest> oh this is big goblins for me i wouldn't even give this a look in the store lol
[2:53:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Here you go, chat. Option to turn it off
[2:53:34] <%Djinnazz> STRESS.
[2:53:42] <stevenellis386> damn how did i miss that.
[2:53:45] <gothmanmothman> an option to turn this off?? That's RAD this seems lit
[2:53:55] <$CrownlessKitty> @crimsonharvest dude there was literally just a button to disable it onscreen
[2:53:59] <@Ranryu692> Pet Shop, you say
[2:54:07] <@Ranryu692> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[2:54:15] <%ennui_on_me> you CAN pet the dog
[2:54:26] <stevenellis386> lol damn the sum of robots i could've saved
[2:54:29] <%Djinnazz> Fairies got like an hour to live.
[2:54:31] <ExpressNode> Rodeer
[2:54:35] <bigshedman> @stevenellis386 I saw some reviews on Steam complaining about the timer so maybe they added it in later...?
[2:54:42] <+ikantreeed> Doy'all remeber the zombie deers?
[2:54:42] <%crimsonharvest> its not the display that goblins me its the whole setup
[2:54:49] <+ikantreeed> are they still out there?
[2:55:09] <TrollKing96> Can you save everyone?
[2:55:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> @crimsonharvest bro, the timer is literally optional? It's not a display change?
[2:55:18] <+sasparillatango> is this Cogs of Battle?
[2:55:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TrollKing96 yes
[2:55:19] <%Monkeyweed21> ur a cog
[2:55:29] <%BoxNavy> oh no temp buffs?
[2:55:41] <illTemperedSeaBass> Does "unsighted" mean they shut off, lose their vision-receptors, or straight-up die, in the context of this game?
[2:55:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> @BoxNavy They work... weird. They are a toggle buff
[2:55:46] <GarbageNirvana> Use the elixirs pat
[2:56:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> @illTemperedSeaBass hollow
[2:56:12] <+pectusumbra> @illTemperedSeaBass lose their sanity basically. Go off the grid, come back hollow
[2:56:14] <%BoxNavy> you must never use them
[2:56:21] <bigshedman> @illTemperedSeaBass Unsighted are basically zombies, so in-game they probably die/become enemies.
[2:56:34] <mothdude> gay gay homosexual gay
[2:56:42] <+Punchasaur> why is every character a hot robo girl
[2:56:44] <Jerp> how's the mind goblins so far?
[2:56:49] <+Punchasaur> not that I mind
[2:56:55] <illTemperedSeaBass> @pectusumbra @bigshedman Oh. That seems even worse.
[2:56:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> robo nips
[2:57:01] <GarbageNirvana> @Punchasaur To make you feel worse about killing them when they turn into robot zombies
[2:57:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Punchasaur because we need this so bad.
[2:57:13] <%skizzuto> Alma has like two in-game weeks on her timer, for those who are too lazy to do math
[2:57:16] <%tanarath> Yeah, the timer is a real goblin
[2:57:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Punchasaur also, the devs are 2 trans women. Of course they'll make the characters hot robots.
[2:57:24] <+Punchasaur> @cappuccinoguil you right
[2:57:29] <stevenellis386> @bigshedman see, that is my only criticism for this game, its just that the timer is the only dirty speck on this jewel of a game, so to speak.
[2:58:01] <GarbageNirvana> Real talk tho I dig these designs
[2:58:10] <%tanarath> Apparently you can turn the timers off @stevenellis386?
[2:58:19] <bigshedman> @stevenellis386 Yeah I get what you mean, but I'm glad the devs were considerate enough to put in an option to turn it off rather than sticking to a rigid vision.
[2:58:20] <mothdude> B I G D A M A G E
[2:58:23] <+Punchasaur> are... are trans people into robots more than other people are?
[2:58:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> @stevenellis386 yeah, you can turn it off, so you can literally remove that speck?
[2:58:37] <%BoxNavy> naruto music
[2:58:40] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:58:48] <Explodincatz> more games need to do this, just give us target dummies
[2:58:53] <+pectusumbra> Yeah there was straight an option to turn off the timers if you wanted
[2:58:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Punchasaur oh, dear, cyberpunk and transhumanism is the most trans shit around LUL
[2:59:01] <%Agami23> theres something rad about a character wearing like traditional kind of monk style outfit with obvious and cool cybernetics
[2:59:12] <$CrownlessKitty> @CappuccinoGuil frfr
[2:59:17] <stevenellis386> @yea seems i can
[2:59:27] <Teyaric> @Punchasaur I mean.... Yeah? Modifiable presentation, total distance from all that damned uncomfortable meat, shiny glows and whatever colours you want?
[2:59:53] <+ikantreeed> damn i'm interested in that game again
[2:59:57] <+ikantreeed> he demo was so cool
[2:59:59] <GarbageNirvana> I wonder if the parry timing is any different depending on the weapon
[3:00:02] <+ikantreeed> imma buy it fuck it
[3:00:05] <+AlucardX60> @Punchasaur Are trans people into transhumanism? ðŸ¤”
[3:00:07] <+Punchasaur> i think that's a bit of an oversimplification but alright
[3:00:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> Cyberpunk 2077 fucking sucks because it forgot the 2 main groups who love the genre: Trans people and Furries
[3:00:20] <ExpressNode> But can you parry time though
[3:00:22] <whycantipostasguest> high score is 80 lol
[3:00:41] <+ikantreeed> what she said
[3:00:41] <GarbageNirvana> Cyberpunk 2077 was such a disappointment in so many ways
[3:00:43] <bigshedman> No Pat but time tho!
[3:00:55] <+Punchasaur> my mistake was asking this in twitch chat
[3:00:56] <%ennui_on_me> Time stops in the training
[3:00:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @bigshedman time doesn't move in training
[3:01:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> COOL PERSON
[3:01:19] <bigshedman> @CappuccinoGuil Ah ok fair enough.
[3:01:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Punchasaur you know what, fair, my bad.
[3:01:33] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:01:37] <Explodincatz> kill all bamboo
[3:01:49] <%baronouroboros> what's this?
[3:01:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> GET READY, PAT
[3:01:57] <Jerp> how's Pat liking this so far?  based on the day counter it looks like the game's just starting
[3:02:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> @baronouroboros Unsighted
[3:02:14] <2meito> music is nice...
[3:02:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Jerp he just started the main game, yeah
[3:02:17] <%ennui_on_me> @baronouroboros cool-ass metroidvania soulslike
[3:02:21] <ArcOfDeath> so now all that time you spent fighting, just passed
[3:02:22] <%spitelite> pat stop gettting hit
[3:02:25] <+ikantreeed> ha got ur ass beat
[3:02:27] <Jiyairo> This is why I didn't use the axe in my playthrough, too slow
[3:02:31] <+fetrigon> oof
[3:02:31] <+Snigglegros> yeah i didnt like the axe, its too awkward to swing
[3:02:32] <%BoxNavy> da money...
[3:02:34] <%baronouroboros> i see
[3:02:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Don't give up Pat! I believe in you!
[3:02:37] <%notsoy> does dying chop off any hours?
[3:02:48] <+Snigglegros> its hitbox is weird compared to the normal swings of sword
[3:02:51] <Jerp> Jiyairo: the axe does ridiculous damage w/parries and whatnot though
[3:02:54] <ArcOfDeath> only the ones you spent before you died
[3:02:54] <2meito> get into fighting games: metroidvania soulslike edition
[3:02:55] <+AlucardX60> Go pick up your time souls
[3:02:57] <circular7> pat blocking punches with his face again?
[3:02:57] <%asgard147> so what happens when time runs out?
[3:03:11] <ArcOfDeath> game over
[3:03:11] <%ennui_on_me> @asgard147 you die
[3:03:14] <+fetrigon> game over
[3:03:15] <+ikantreeed> that music is really dope
[3:03:15] <GarbageNirvana> Bad End I'm guessing
[3:03:17] <Jerp> as soon as I actually started using the axe it ended up being my main
[3:03:18] <Manwad> you die in real life
[3:03:26] <%asgard147> ah
[3:03:29] <Jerp> actually for a while I was just dual wielding axe and sword and that's actually a solid combo
[3:03:32] <bigshedman> By the way, music slightly changing when enemies are near? SUPER cool.
[3:03:36] <mothdude> I recommend putting on the chip that stops you from losing stamina while running
[3:03:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> See if you can buy a blueprint?
[3:03:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> flameblade seems pretty tight
[3:03:48] <+ikantreeed> i'm trynna be built like that character, but without working out or surgery
[3:03:54] <%andrewofbob> I'm looking forward to Sifu - you death clock only advances when you get your arse kicked
[3:04:06] <@Fuggins4U> You're going down, punk.
[3:04:07] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:04:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> @andrewofbob so... a health bar?
[3:04:17] <+Punchasaur> so this game has a bit of an outer wilds/worlds situation with it's name, as I opened this stream thinking it was for Undetected lol
[3:04:20] <+pectusumbra> god this game looks SO good though
[3:04:56] <Jerp> pectusumbra: it plays as good as it looks, which is to say really good.  I really enjoyed my playthrough
[3:04:59] <%ennui_on_me> yeah, shadow clone jutsu
[3:05:04] <+tempestzephyr> they're narutos
[3:05:06] <+Snigglegros> you shuold look at the stuff int he class cases in the shops
[3:05:09] <%andrewofbob> @CappuccinoGuil When your HP gets emptied, you age a few years and respawn - get too old and it's game over
[3:05:16] <ArcOfDeath> i mean, not real, but they can still kill you
[3:05:17] <@Fuggins4U> Pat. Syringe.
[3:05:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:05:24] <+pectusumbra> I do have the game, just haven't booted it up on my steam account
[3:05:25] <@Fuggins4U> do the plsma, plas-man
[3:05:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @andrewofbob oh okay, yeah, that's real cool
[3:05:32] <%basswizard11> thers something about the world design that just screams steven universe
[3:05:36] <circular7> pat hates living
[3:05:51] <%tanarath> Death ages you, geez
[3:06:00] <%ennui_on_me> @basswizard11 the giant hands sticking out of the ground are very SU
[3:06:01] <%basswizard11> like the giant hands sticking out of the ground and stuff
[3:06:08] <+pectusumbra> All that said: THIS. THIS is anxiety for SURE. Not the timers, but the idea your failures mean characters are literally dying\
[3:06:09] <circular7> I can already hear the goblins LUL
[3:06:12] <Jerp> the demo for this game is huge.  I wonder if the demo is still available or it was just for the steam next fest.  there's a ton of extras and side content.  I spent a few hours wandering around it before release
[3:06:14] <GarbageNirvana> No stamina cost for running seems like a permanent fixture imo
[3:06:29] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The best defense is blowing their ass out
[3:06:40] <PortableBoredom> Don't need to parry if you've already squished everything trying to klil you
[3:06:41] <@Fuggins4U> Is this Fullmetal Alchemist??
[3:06:45] <AbnormalVoid> Paige Robot
[3:06:50] <%ennui_on_me> hi Alphonse E
[3:06:50] <PortableBoredom> yes
[3:06:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Jerp demo seems to have been only for next fest. it's not available on the steam page now.
[3:07:04] <+fetrigon> big boi
[3:07:07] <+MightyDuckShoes> romantic fist
[3:07:14] <@Fuggins4U> it's the Smackdown fist
[3:07:17] <+Snigglegros> it is on game pass
[3:07:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, HEAL LUL
[3:07:37] <+fetrigon> bruh
[3:07:38] <Jerp> Guil: ah, damn . it did a great job of showcasing the game.  it's rare for a metroidvania demo to show off the exploration and abilities as well as this one
[3:07:39] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You gotta hit the right buttons to play the game
[3:07:42] <bigshedman> Time is running out, Pat!
[3:07:44] <vile_brand> why you bad at videogame pat?
[3:07:49] <@Ranryu692> You need to hit StarboardB, not PortB
[3:07:55] <+Punchasaur> Arby's?
[3:07:58] <circular7> not knowing your left from your right? classic
[3:08:02] <Jerp> Iris is the true mind goblin
[3:08:11] <AbnormalVoid> *slide whistle noise*
[3:08:14] <+fetrigon> ArBs KomodoHype
[3:08:15] <GarbageNirvana> Makes sense that the tutorial fairy would be one of the first to run out of juice tbh
[3:08:18] <+TheFlyingChurro> ! WOOLIE !
[3:08:19] <SaltyAzteca> Replace Alma's death scream with Ryu's Sf2 turbo KO voice
[3:08:26] <@Fuggins4U> don't be shabby against shinobi
[3:08:29] <thedoodynator3000> so how tight is the parry window?
[3:08:31] <Ryong> AH YES
[3:08:32] <+Moaradin> oof
[3:08:36] <+acridpaladin> pogonaLUL
[3:08:37] <vile_brand> pat just stop being bad
[3:08:40] <Ryong> the hardest enemy in the game
[3:08:41] <%notsoy> where heal
[3:08:43] <Jerp> I want a toggle where you can tell iris to chill with the tips and just focus on the story dialogue
[3:08:47] <%VictorVonLouche> 320 hours left wow thats going down fast
[3:08:48] <GarbageNirvana> You might be better off not using the axe
[3:08:51] <+fetrigon> maybe do parry practice instead of in field
[3:08:54] <+Snigglegros> maybe try the sword  again?
[3:08:54] <%Sotetsu> Dont give up, skeleton
[3:08:55] <luciluxlu0> maybe a faster weapon?
[3:08:56] <@Fuggins4U> can you still switch to easy mode?
[3:08:57] <%Agami23> is it possible that a big beefy weapon isnt worth it?
[3:08:59] <mothdude> Yeah sword night be better against those guys
[3:08:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @thedoodynator3000 there's a parry and a block, so it's generous.
[3:09:00] <DrkJP520> What is that, a sub count?
[3:09:02] <vile_brand> try a different weapon.
[3:09:07] <Ryong> you can switch to easy mode whenever
[3:09:12] <Jerp> that was the only thing that stood out in my playthrough.  loved the rest.  still want to do a couple more playthroughs
[3:09:13] <@Fuggins4U> it'd make chuckle tho
[3:09:18] <+fetrigon> @drkjp520 ye
[3:09:20] <+pectusumbra> Like holy hell just listening to pat bite it is actually making my blood act up
[3:09:22] <%ennui_on_me> I really found the axe unwieldy
[3:09:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> just put the robot gun in your robot mouth
[3:09:27] <+iLike_femboys> @PatStaresAt do you think the last of us hbo series is gonna be good?
[3:09:36] <+pectusumbra> not him being bad but anxiety thoughts and oof
[3:09:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> Big hands are creepy.
[3:09:50] <+tempestzephyr> you've got healing
[3:09:52] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:09:53] <thedoodynator3000> @CappuccinoGuil Thanks!
[3:09:57] <+pectusumbra> running out of stamina?
[3:09:58] <stevenellis386> damn son
[3:09:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> Parry needs stamina
[3:10:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> All you have to do, is do better than you are currently doing.
[3:10:02] <+acridpaladin> that axe seems really bad for wanting to spam
[3:10:04] <Ryong> sword and axe have different parry timings I think
[3:10:12] <%JoshManVGH> Are you mashing the middle button?
[3:10:16] <+Punchasaur> the hands are a death stranding/elden ring tie in
[3:10:18] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:10:18] <Jerp> this area in particular just cut me apart until I spent some time practicing those enemies
[3:10:18] <%JoshManVGH> Aaaaah
[3:10:23] <+fetrigon> ah yeah that'll do it
[3:10:26] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:10:29] <GarbageNirvana> Can't just mash
[3:10:36] <SaltyAzteca> So the swing and the parry share the same bar. Neat
[3:10:40] <vile_brand> your axe is very stamina costly
[3:10:54] <Ryong> I mean parry costs stamina in souls
[3:11:10] <+Moaradin> parry looks pretty satisfying in this game
[3:11:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> This game that has a death clock requires you to STOP and WAIT. I love it. LUL
[3:11:23] <Jerp> Pat's already parrying the archers better than I ever did.  something about their timing ruined me
[3:11:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Don't forget your guns.
[3:11:33] <GarbageNirvana> RB is a pretty cool button yeah
[3:11:33] <%RealThiele> gut gid
[3:11:34] <%Agami23> dont the clones die in one hit? why not shoot them?
[3:11:34] <vile_brand> i think a perfect parry fully recharges stamina
[3:11:41] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:11:44] <SaltyAzteca> HEY LISTEN!
[3:11:45] <Manwad> good thing it seems you have like 300 lives at this rate
[3:11:49] <Ryong> did you also forget to do the jumping attack
[3:11:55] <Explodincatz> HEY LISTEN
[3:11:56] <+acridpaladin> its ok you werent using that money
[3:12:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Alma pulls out a gun "Parry this you filthy casual"
[3:13:07] <TimetodiveLTX> yo are these straight up hyper light driftwe resources
[3:13:21] <TimetodiveLTX> assets, whatever
[3:13:21] <Ryong> no
[3:13:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> PICK IT UP
[3:13:30] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:13:46] <+AlucardX60> Do you not have a heal?
[3:13:50] <TimetodiveLTX> this is just hyper light drifter, you're right
[3:13:58] <GarbageNirvana> I wonder if those are the arms of really big robots
[3:13:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> I wonder if you can throw it at a MFer LUL
[3:13:59] <+TopTieramisu> it's a botw puzzle
[3:14:00] <%ennui_on_me> Nope, his heal's at 70% rn
[3:14:07] <%ennui_on_me> needs to kill enemies to get it
[3:14:08] <marcomatame> oh damn this game look cool
[3:14:20] <SaltyAzteca> it needs to be 100% to heal?
[3:14:24] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> But does he see though?
[3:14:25] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:14:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> No
[3:14:27] <%ennui_on_me> yep
[3:14:29] <+ReverandSavage> hey pat hey chat, hope everyone is doing well
[3:14:29] <2meito> the dynamic music is super good
[3:14:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He doesn't
[3:14:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SaltyAzteca yup
[3:14:39] <AbnormalVoid> Hurry Up, Pat :)
[3:14:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Because you didn't hear. so you didn't see
[3:14:45] <SaltyAzteca> thats fucked
[3:14:46] <%asgard147> Remember Pat, your lifestyle determines your deathstyle
[3:14:48] <GarbageNirvana> You have a dodge roll in this game don't you?
[3:14:49] <%ThirdWelles> But they make a noise though
[3:14:55] <GarbageNirvana> Or some kinda dodge
[3:14:58] <Ryong> @GarbageNirvana yes
[3:14:59] <+iLike_femboys> @PatStaresAt we all say that the last of us 2 did a revenge bad story poorly, but what game did a good revenge bad story?
[3:15:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> clock is ticking
[3:15:04] <%RealThiele> hey
[3:15:04] <circular7> hurry up
[3:15:04] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gotta go fast!
[3:15:06] <DrkJP520> there's no time
[3:15:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So is this Lightning Returns, then? :P
[3:15:07] <SaltyAzteca> HEY LISTEN THO
[3:15:09] <%RealThiele> listen
[3:15:18] <circular7> hey hey
[3:15:18] <vile_brand> but how would you get that zelda feel without someone screaming in your ear?
[3:15:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "You're being tiiiiimed. Come on, listen. Hurry, hurry, faster, faster."
[3:15:20] <AngryPumpkin1995> Heal
[3:15:24] <Jerp> navi 2.0.  I hope they tone her down a bit
[3:15:35] <%coward_man> @iLike_femboys Metal Gear Rising
[3:15:35] <%ThirdWelles> Just use sound queues
[3:15:53] <circular7> "I did it" dies
[3:15:54] <@Spydurman> "All right I did it" LUL
[3:15:54] <%Agami23> pat, shoot the clones
[3:15:58] <Ryong> the ninja are very hard
[3:16:01] <%ennui_on_me> I really found the rhythm of this combat super hard to get used to
[3:16:01] <%spitelite> maybe go back to the sword
[3:16:02] <%RealThiele> forgets gun
[3:16:02] <%ThirdWelles> Stop watching for the animation. Just listen to the noise they make
[3:16:04] <SaltyAzteca> Can you use another weapon thats not so stamina heavy
[3:16:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You just gotta believe!
[3:16:06] <vile_brand> i think its just your current weapon
[3:16:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Use gun on clones?
[3:16:07] <whycantipostasguest> use the sword
[3:16:08] <Ryong> and the axe parry timing is diferent from sword
[3:16:13] <mothdude> Sword might work better here. Easier to hit them.
[3:16:17] <+AlucardX60> New strategy, ignore everything.
[3:16:23] <circular7> hurry up pat :)
[3:16:25] <Ryong> also DASH ATTACK
[3:16:35] <%ennui_on_me> the big slow swing is not helping when you have such a narrow window to do things in
[3:16:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, you could check the crafting store for blueprints?
[3:16:46] <Jerp> how much advice is Pat looking for?  I have a suggestion that might make mixing in parries a lot smoother
[3:17:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Seems like the sword is better
[3:17:22] <SaltyAzteca> Sword is for rug
[3:17:22] <Ryong> did pat learn about dash and charge attacks or
[3:17:24] <Explodincatz> this blue hurts my eyes
[3:17:40] <%ennui_on_me> nah the dogs you want are friendly
[3:17:40] <+TopTieramisu> is this supposed to be night lighting?
[3:17:47] <%ennui_on_me> yea
[3:17:50] <Ryong> yes this is night
[3:17:54] <+fetrigon> @toptieramisu yes
[3:17:56] <+TopTieramisu> this is like those night scenes in tv shows where it's actually just daylight under a filter
[3:17:57] <%ennui_on_me> there's a day/night cycle
[3:18:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> No, it's space
[3:18:12] <Jerp> "day as night" is the term for it
[3:18:21] <Ryong> dash attaaaaaack
[3:18:29] <%ennui_on_me> I always hear day for night
[3:19:02] <Ryong> also there's an actual RUN he's not using I guess
[3:19:03] <Jerp> that might also be a term people use for it.  someone I work with had done some stuff in the film industry and that was the term he used
[3:19:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> That's a cat though
[3:19:41] <cheapdoc> How is he doing vs the goooblins
[3:19:44] <Ryong> yeah they're like, panthers
[3:19:52] <BackflipCharm> The only game where night time is easier
[3:20:02] <Jerp> the design looks like displacer beasts
[3:20:05] <cheapdoc> Good all displacer beasts
[3:20:05] <%andrewofbob> 2 doors
[3:20:07] <Ryong> @cheapdoc he's dying too much for it to be important yet
[3:20:12] <Ryong> @Jerp RIGHT!?
[3:20:13] <circular7> w expect nothing less pat
[3:20:25] <%Archphronimos> hey learning how things work and getting better at the mechanics IS progress
[3:20:27] <cheapdoc> @Ryong Gotcha, that's valid too
[3:20:32] <GarbageNirvana> If nothing else I suppose it encourages replayability to see if you can do better next time?
[3:20:39] <+Mkingston> Elden Ring's stand summoning makes it  Chaos Legion 2. I'm not wrong.
[3:20:44] <TimetodiveLTX> HLD dash sound effect
[3:20:44] <Ryong> pat press attack while dashing
[3:20:51] <TimetodiveLTX> pitched down
[3:20:53] <SaltyAzteca> Progress
[3:20:53] <+TopTieramisu> night time being easier than day is a novel concept
[3:20:54] <Jerp> to be fair the controls are kind of complex and there's a lot of stuff you can do in combat, so there's a hefty adjustment period
[3:20:54] <Ryong> also AKIRA BIKE
[3:20:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THAT AKIRA BIKE
[3:21:03] <+AlucardX60> That's an Akira bike
[3:21:04] <%notsoy> bonfi-terminal
[3:21:09] <%coward_man> oh hey it's an akira bike
[3:21:25] <SaltyAzteca> Ehhhhh...6/10
[3:21:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Doctor was DOPE it seems
[3:21:38] <Jerp> the terminals look like evil robots looking at you
[3:21:39] <Explodincatz> haha reference
[3:21:52] <%ennui_on_me> The doctor is just the kid from Ready Player One
[3:21:56] <%greasypete00> FIGHT AND KILL
[3:22:00] <Ryong> JUST GIT GUD
[3:22:01] <Ryong> YOU CAN DO IT
[3:22:06] <%Monkeyweed21> fight  it coward
[3:22:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It's just standing there. MENECINGLY@
[3:22:10] <Jerp> has Pat fought any of those yet?
[3:22:11] <Ryong> I killed all of them on my first try so
[3:22:14] <circular7> fight it coward
[3:22:24] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:22:36] <Ryong> DASH ATTACK
[3:22:39] <Jerp> ok that answers that
[3:22:39] <+tempestzephyr> almost
[3:22:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> OKAY, THAT'S DOABLE
[3:22:41] <+ReverandSavage> almost got em
[3:22:42] <+fetrigon> @jerp yes
[3:22:46] <vile_brand> big damage
[3:22:46] <mothdude> Do A Ble
[3:22:47] <stormhawk9891> POSSIBLE
[3:22:48] <BackflipCharm> So parrying seems pretty important
[3:22:48] <circular7> hurry up pat :)
[3:22:52] <SaltyAzteca> That was some Sekiro levels of parry
[3:22:52] <%andrewofbob> Hesitation costs time, fighting was the right choice
[3:22:53] <+fetrigon> sure is
[3:22:58] <Ryong> please try a dash attack it's SO much better than normal attacks
[3:22:58] <%ThirdWelles> Rhythm game parry's baby
[3:22:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> DIE IN 2 HITS OR KILL IN 2 HITS
[3:23:05] <+fetrigon> go get em champ :)
[3:23:17] <mothdude> Gettem with the spin attack!
[3:23:24] <%greasypete00> remember to use heals
[3:23:25] <SaltyAzteca> WE GOT CHEEEEEVES
[3:23:28] <bigshedman> Need what?
[3:23:29] <Ryong> you don't need the warning
[3:23:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just do it perfect
[3:23:44] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Means you aint no bitch Pat.
[3:23:45] <+tempestzephyr> I guess you didn't need to sneak
[3:23:47] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype SICK
[3:24:01] <xiccy> You get a specific weapon to beat them later. it helps lots
[3:24:12] <bear_breaker20> cause ninjas
[3:24:16] <+TopTieramisu> they have large chakra pools
[3:24:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> ninjas are hard
[3:24:17] <BackflipCharm> To make it hard to progress quickly in the time based game
[3:24:17] <%greasypete00> you can
[3:24:20] <Explodincatz> cause u fought them wrong
[3:24:20] <Jerp> those ninjas are disproportionately hard for sure
[3:24:20] <+fetrigon> cause there are a lot of em
[3:24:20] <xiccy> Yep
[3:24:27] <+SWindleFeD> Pat you just answered your own question, they're ninja
[3:24:28] <%greasypete00> you can beat it with the starter weapon
[3:24:29] <%andrewofbob> The timer seems to be ticking slower, like, it's slow that one minute a second
[3:24:31] <+AlucardX60> they are fast and you are blind
[3:24:32] <%ThirdWelles> Trick must just be "parry everything, but only hit the one that's summoning"
[3:24:33] <+tempestzephyr> they have the higher action economy
[3:24:37] <%andrewofbob> slower than*
[3:24:45] <SaltyAzteca> Where's the Magician anyway Kappa
[3:24:48] <Ryong> dash attack helps a ton with the ninja
[3:25:05] <Ryong> and Pat is using the weak but fast gun instead of the normal gun
[3:25:35] <Ryong> I wonder if we should tell Pat something that will make his mind goblins go HARD
[3:25:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oooh
[3:25:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I see the puzzle
[3:25:55] <Ryong> A PUZZLE
[3:25:55] <BackflipCharm> I'm just tuning in. Is parrying your only defensive option?
[3:25:59] <+pectusumbra> order shown on the other side of the bridge
[3:26:00] <GarbageNirvana> Didn't even see that hint before the bridge huh
[3:26:03] <Ryong> QUICK, CALL PAIGE
[3:26:07] <Ryong> @BackflipCharm you can also dodge
[3:26:12] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[3:26:17] <xiccy> Yeah you do
[3:26:18] <%ennui_on_me> how can this beeee
[3:26:25] <%skizzuto> Stumbo
[3:26:29] <Ryong> IT CEASES TO BE
[3:26:34] <thedoodynator3000> Its like it needs a specific order or something///
[3:26:34] <%andrewofbob> Have you tried 0451?
[3:26:54] <bigshedman> 41235
[3:27:01] <Explodincatz> put your glasses on
[3:27:12] <Ryong> ok who here already beat this
[3:27:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> speeeeeen
[3:27:26] <SaltyAzteca> ITS DOING DRIFTS
[3:27:33] <GeneralHysterics> don't beef it, bro
[3:27:45] <%VictorVonLouche> A high jump might be useful here
[3:27:49] <+pectusumbra> heal
[3:27:51] <bear_breaker20> these effects belong in crazy taxi
[3:27:52] <%Movemeister> Spinarak sure has changed
[3:27:58] <Ryong> dash attack and charge attacks deal a ton more damage than normal attacks but they too hard
[3:28:00] <scrumbotime> The spider is doing donuts
[3:28:36] <thedoodynator3000> high jump the bullets my guy
[3:28:43] <%tanarath> god, seeing pat ignore the mechanic this fight is meant to teach you is weird.
[3:28:56] <SaltyAzteca> NICE
[3:28:57] <xiccy> You can jump the bullets
[3:28:58] <+tempestzephyr> NICE
[3:29:00] <%ennui_on_me> I kinda dislike how cluttered the screen can get. Those little dudes totally blend in with the mess on the ground if I'm not looking directly at them.
[3:29:02] <circular7> you. did it
[3:29:02] <SaltyAzteca> 1st try!
[3:29:04] <%andrewofbob> Aint got time for dying to bosses
[3:29:04] <luciluxlu0> I did the same thing lol
[3:29:12] <BackflipCharm> Parry is the only mechanic you need
[3:29:12] <%tanarath> Yes
[3:29:12] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah you got a tutorial prompt that said "Press A to jump high"
[3:29:13] <+acridpaladin> why jump when you can parry for free damage tho
[3:29:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> You got High Jump jsut now, Pat
[3:29:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That's why they gave you HIGH JUMP BOOTS
[3:29:16] <%ThirdWelles> at the beginning of the fight
[3:29:16] <%VictorVonLouche> You got a HIGH JUMP
[3:29:18] <%greasypete00> i fought that boss way differently
[3:29:19] <SaltyAzteca> @xiccy Nah mate, parry life
[3:29:19] <bigshedman> Why'd you think they gave you the jump boots?!
[3:29:29] <%andrewofbob> Why jump the bullets when you can take them for yourself?
[3:29:31] <Jerp> yeah as soon as I learned you can parry everything, I just parried anything I could time well
[3:29:38] <luciluxlu0> but parry tho
[3:29:38] <%RaziWraith> parrying the bullets was better, leave Pat alone.
[3:29:39] <+TopTieramisu> what's up with the crying robot
[3:29:39] <AngryPumpkin1995> Pat just went big damage over dodge
[3:29:40] <bigshedman> Pat please. One goblin at a time.
[3:29:40] <Frogwash> More damage by staying alive
[3:29:46] <xiccy> If you don't fuck it up, but you did and got hit. A lot.
[3:29:47] <%tanarath> Parry costs stamina & commits you to high risk high reward
[3:29:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> LOOK, YOUR GF HAD AN AXE TOO
[3:29:51] <GarbageNirvana> Both Pat and Woolie seem to follow the philosophy of "why dodge when you can parry"
[3:29:51] <+acridpaladin> chat upset by free damage
[3:29:51] <$CrownlessKitty> im with pat on this one, damage Good
[3:29:56] <Jerp> parrying is a way better choice if you succeed
[3:30:02] <Explodincatz> only for 7 each bullet tho
[3:30:06] <+tempestzephyr> I guessing  jumping is less risky
[3:30:07] <BackflipCharm> I think parrying might be a bit too strong. Seems like every other defensive option is invalid in comparison
[3:30:12] <+TopTieramisu> chat's getting too heated LUL
[3:30:13] <thedoodynator3000> more i frames though?
[3:30:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Explodincatz who's doing more DPS? The person who jumps or the person who parries?
[3:30:29] <Ryong> Parrying is VERY good and dashing is more used to attack than anything
[3:30:30] <SaltyAzteca> Everything breathes
[3:30:33] <bigshedman> @TopTieramisu I'm not mad you're mad!
[3:31:15] <BackflipCharm> PATHS UNLOCKED
[3:31:16] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:31:20] <Ryong> also
[3:31:24] <+fetrigon> yo
[3:31:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> TRAVERSAL = UNLOCKED
[3:31:27] <Ryong> you can jump on boxes
[3:31:33] <Ryong> and you can carry the boxes...
[3:31:37] <$CrownlessKitty> WALLET
[3:31:43] <%ThirdWelles> WOAH. A "Don't drop your souls, period" chip is pretty fuckin good
[3:31:53] <%notsoy> not losing money on death sounds pretty good idk
[3:32:26] <%ennui_on_me> God this game is so good.
[3:32:34] <%RaziWraith> No consequences for death chip!
[3:32:38] <+pectusumbra> YO, back to the top left, dust!
[3:32:45] <Ryong> I mean you lose time
[3:32:47] <bigshedman> You passed a ping for dust
[3:32:51] <Ryong> a much more important resource
[3:32:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> now y'all seeing why everyone is calling this the best Metroidvania of 2021?
[3:33:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> EVEN with Dread being out?
[3:33:10] <BackflipCharm> Yeah but the dust gives you more time
[3:33:17] <bigshedman> No it was like the previous screen tho you are WASTING TIME PAT
[3:33:27] <Jerp> this game definitely has better ability gating and exploration than Dread.  it's way more open
[3:33:29] <Ryong> this game is 100% absolutely made for speedrunning
[3:33:39] <%ennui_on_me> really feels like pat's goblins just aren't here
[3:33:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Is Pat even feeling the goblins?
[3:33:59] <SaltyAzteca> Heading towards disaster!
[3:34:02] <stevenellis386> SingsNote my jam SingsNote
[3:34:05] <+fetrigon> @ryong most def
[3:34:18] <%RaziWraith> Why does Iris have one heart by her name?
[3:34:19] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:34:21] <Ryong> game is too hard for goblins to even start being a problem
[3:34:23] <%Coffmad> Coffmad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Pat do you plan on uploading anymore games to youtube in the 4-est of the K from now on? My UK timeframe cant catch you on streams nearly often enough :(
[3:34:52] <mothdude> Shotgun rules
[3:34:54] <Ryong> did no one here actually like, beat this?
[3:34:55] <luciluxlu0> goblins comes later when more time passes
[3:34:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Cog blueprints sound good
[3:35:00] <%andrewofbob> Are the hearts relationship levels?
[3:35:03] <%ennui_on_me> everybody jumps at the sound of a shotgun. where I come from everybody's got one
[3:35:05] <xiccy> Grenade is fun too
[3:35:06] <SaltyAzteca> This muzak music
[3:35:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RaziWraith Given that I've seen one next to EVERYONE's name, I'm guessing it's an affection meter?
[3:35:09] <Ryong> @andrewofbob yes
[3:35:11] <+eGregiousGames> the fact that you can see all their remaining lifespans is just brutal
[3:35:16] <GarbageNirvana> Surprise it's Minecraft
[3:35:36] <+pectusumbra> @eGregiousGames that and seeing your own life is an existential nightmare itself
[3:35:39] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt can you craft stuff by looking it up online or you NEED the blueprint?
[3:35:39] <+fetrigon> @zaphire_saucypants he will once his first npc goes unsighted
[3:35:43] <BackflipCharm> Looks like you need the HIGHER jump boots
[3:35:47] <Ryong> there is a store that can sell you a very good blueprint in the city
[3:36:06] <Ryong> you can craft it manually
[3:36:12] <Ryong> and it's absolutely part of the speedrunning tech
[3:36:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm assuming there's a water walk item to get later or something?
[3:36:27] <%notsoy> maybe you get a higher jump later?
[3:36:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @fetrigon not sure he'd care overmuch given it seems, judging from the amount of time left, the first one to turn is likely the Navi stand-in.
[3:36:45] <SaltyAzteca> Oh, flame(blade)!
[3:36:47] <Ryong> there's a bunch of upgrades that you get blueprints for instead of the item themselves
[3:36:56] <+pectusumbra> there's an old woman that gives you cogs that will turn before her
[3:37:04] <stevenellis386> listen to that bass SingsNote
[3:37:07] <Ryong> so if you know the blueprints you can just make everything super early on
[3:37:12] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is the time mechanic as stressful as it looks? Or it's not that bad?
[3:37:20] <xiccy> Use mine cart
[3:37:24] <+Moaradin> SourPls
[3:37:29] <+fetrigon> @zaphire_saucypants yeah you may be right
[3:37:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Might be a different key?
[3:37:31] <LucasNazatoArt> You can find the key inside the dungeon
[3:37:33] <Ryong> Pat, grab a box.
[3:37:42] <+pectusumbra> the key is a shortcut. Dead Rising style new game plus?
[3:37:43] <Ryong> all keys work on all doors
[3:37:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Gamers love jazz and they don't even know it
[3:38:06] <Ryong> MIND GOBLINS UNLOCKED
[3:38:25] <Ryong> Pat. boxes.
[3:38:39] <Ryong> you can grab them. and jump on them.
[3:38:44] <stevenellis386> @ReallyBigRocks oh yea agreed. its what got me into jazz
[3:38:44] <%Dakuu75> I keep hearing the old Kratos block-push "GRRR-RAH~!" in my head
[3:39:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> THAT SHOTGUN RULES
[3:39:38] <Ryong> there is one cog that reigns supreme and you do not have it, sadly
[3:39:47] <BackflipCharm> Aiming is for nerd
[3:40:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> BRUH
[3:40:24] <Ryong> this is how minecarts work
[3:41:02] <+tempestzephyr> Pat LOVES syringes :)
[3:41:35] <Ryong> the hardest approach to changing the gates
[3:41:49] <%notsoy> you even fill it with a mysterious fluid
[3:41:53] <Ryong> pat don't break the boxes
[3:41:56] <Ryong> USE THEM
[3:41:56] <%notsoy> truly a mysterious syringe
[3:41:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> I can't really see, but is the cog counter on the bottom right?
[3:42:06] <@Ranryu692> "That syringe combo is going to be really good" is a good one for that Pat quotes out of context twitter
[3:42:12] <Ryong> @CappuccinoGuil yes
[3:42:17] <+pectusumbra> minecart if you want that stuff
[3:42:22] <%Dakuu75> Did Pat ever play "Scarlet Nexus"? (wondering if its good)
[3:42:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ryong hmmmm I would've liked that part of the UI to be up near the health, honestly
[3:42:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Same for ammo
[3:42:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Dakuu75 yeah he did, its ok
[3:42:52] <+fetrigon> Pat should definitely play CrossCode. This game's combat was inspired by it.
[3:42:56] <%notsoy> what does hitting use on boxes do instead of smashing them
[3:43:10] <+fetrigon> ah :(
[3:43:12] <stevenellis386> thats a shame
[3:43:16] <mothdude> How is Pat so good at the perfect reload?
[3:43:17] <Ryong> bizarre
[3:43:19] <%Dakuu75> @SveriSageAdvice neat.
[3:43:23] <Ryong> as crosscode is great
[3:43:33] <Ryong> @mothdude he traded the parry timing for reload timing
[3:43:34] <%ennui_on_me> still better at it than I am
[3:43:43] <$CrownlessKitty> crosscode IS great
[3:44:11] <Ryong> flameblade is 100% this game's drake sword btw
[3:44:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think you nearly have enough chips
[3:44:14] <+fetrigon> well anyone reading this should check it out if they haven't already.
[3:44:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> Or whatever the currency is
[3:44:20] <Ryong> super good early on, doesn't scale well enough
[3:44:22] <BackflipCharm> I feel like for your parry heavy style having a weapon that does one big hit is probably optimal
[3:44:22] <stevenellis386> Im glad Im finding im not the only one thats played crosscode.
[3:44:31] <Byronic_dreamer> You have a sword
[3:44:32] <Ryong> crosscode rules
[3:44:46] <SaltyAzteca> NICE
[3:44:48] <%Dakuu75> nice
[3:45:33] <%SvenHolgersson> What is this chill ass mucis
[3:45:52] <Badgerconda_> It gives me some very slight Chrono Trigger vibes
[3:45:53] <stevenellis386> SingsNote
[3:46:03] <Teyaric> I WANNA love crosscode, but the mechanics are designed to abuse your hands. Aiming, moving, dodging, weaving moves in - It's like character action tier, but that hold the aim mandatory setup is... rough.
[3:46:04] <+alternative_flu> I lost my mind ages ago have you seen it?
[3:46:07] <$CrownlessKitty> lofi tunes to lose your cogs to
[3:46:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Lo-fi beats to eat robussy to
[3:46:15] <+sewermonk> we need a pat mind goblin mixtape
[3:46:15] <%ElkRiverDog> I wonder if it changes as the clock ticks down?
[3:46:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> "lo-fi beats to hang out with your cool lesbian robo girlfriend to"
[3:46:29] <+cstigerwright> Is this like a zelda typ edungeon or just part of the overworld
[3:46:30] <Ryong> Pat
[3:46:33] <Ryong> boxes
[3:46:36] <Ryong> SUPREME COG
[3:46:37] <Ryong> BEST COG
[3:46:49] <Ryong> REVIVE COG IS THE BEST
[3:46:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> COGGERS
[3:47:05] <Jerp> has anyone said Coggers yet?  or Cogchamp?
[3:47:06] <Ryong> the time has come
[3:47:08] <Jerp> okay there it goes
[3:47:09] <bigshedman> CogChamp
[3:47:10] <$CrownlessKitty> coggers bro
[3:47:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's real COGGERS
[3:47:20] <bigshedman> @jerp impeccable timing
[3:47:21] <Ryong> noooo
[3:47:23] <Ryong> pat go back
[3:47:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's my little CogChamp
[3:47:30] <%Dakuu75> @CappuccinoGuil oh-god-damn-it. lol
[3:47:34] <Ryong> go back to that room mister
[3:47:38] <%Dakuu75> STOP LOL
[3:47:44] <Ryong> I will backseat in this specific instance
[3:47:50] <heartlesshealer> How's Unsighted so far? Been trying to keep an eye on it
[3:47:54] <Ryong> DO YOU HEAR
[3:48:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Shoot the upper cart?
[3:48:19] <heartlesshealer> like, do the controls feel okay?
[3:48:21] <Ryong> gun
[3:48:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I saw some vines
[3:48:29] <%bravebravesrobin> hey Pat, if they have Arby's up there, they just introduced fries infused vodka drinks; you can thank me later Cheer500
[3:48:34] <%RaziWraith> surprised there wasn't a yell for that fall
[3:48:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nvm, trick of the light
[3:48:40] <%ennui_on_me> who imprisoned that dog here
[3:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> doggers
[3:48:44] <%YakumoYomi> Doggo acquired

[3:49:49] <Ryong> 5 pets for cheevo
[3:49:52] <Ryong> dog BITE
[3:49:57] <%YakumoYomi> What the dog doin'?
[3:49:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Do you have to take him back to Tobias now?
[3:50:00] <+fetrigon> does petting move time?
[3:50:01] <BackflipCharm> If you let this dog die I'm leaving the stream
[3:50:05] <heartlesshealer> dog be a dog
[3:50:07] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:50:08] <MarylandJutsu> YE YEY YE
[3:50:15] <Ryong> you can send the dog back, not an escort quest
[3:50:19] <MarylandJutsu> Always pet dog
[3:50:30] <SaltyAzteca> Dog knows how to phase into reality, nice!
[3:50:33] <%ennui_on_me> dog does attacks
[3:50:34] <xiccy> Dog helps in fights
[3:50:36] <%Dakuu75> dog has 1 hp
[3:50:38] <Ryong> you can always get it back
[3:50:39] <scrumbotime> What's the stats on that doggo?
[3:50:39] <SaltyAzteca> Also, stats?
[3:50:39] <LucasNazatoArt> He fights
[3:50:41] <Explodincatz> fun?
[3:50:44] <bigshedman> Give it a sword and make it Bladewolf
[3:50:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Can dog die?
[3:50:48] <Ryong> dog helps in fights but gets tired
[3:50:50] <%RaziWraith> but does the dog die? monkaS
[3:50:52] <+Moaradin> monkaS can the dog die
[3:50:53] <%Dakuu75> can heal dog?
[3:50:54] <Ryong> the dog cannot die
[3:50:56] <heartlesshealer> dog has HEALTH
[3:51:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> DOG DON'T DIE, DOG GET TIRED???
[3:51:06] <LucasNazatoArt> But eventually he will need a nap (3 hours)
[3:51:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> this game rules.
[3:51:08] <Ryong> dog has AFFECTION METER not health
[3:51:15] <BackflipCharm> This dog got JUMPS
[3:51:17] <heartlesshealer> feeding dog might heal, but pat needs 15 apple
[3:51:23] <+AlucardX60> Hearts are not health in this game chat.
[3:51:26] <%Dakuu75> ooooh~
[3:51:35] <Ryong> pat has 15 apple, he gave dog a bunch already
[3:51:41] <heartlesshealer> @AlucardX60 that's wonderful news
[3:51:47] <BackflipCharm> Can you sacrifice the dog for more time on the clock?
[3:51:53] <EASrake> increase dog love
[3:52:03] <SaltyAzteca> @AlucardX60 Castlevania rules?
[3:52:10] <xiccy> There's stuff to the left
[3:52:16] <+AlucardX60> Castlevania rules
[3:52:18] <Ryong> also I'm sure the fact that you give dogs something that looks like an apple is a brazilian thing because we have wolves that eat a specific type of apple.
[3:52:50] <%Dakuu75> how do you unlock more chip slots?
[3:53:02] <Ryong> @Dakuu75 you buy them at the "bonfire"
[3:53:03] <%ennui_on_me> pay for em
[3:53:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ryong maybe? I don't know, apple makes sense for the setting.
[3:53:23] <%Dakuu75> @Ryong ah, kk. cool.
[3:53:53] <+fetrigon> oof
[3:53:54] <%skizzuto> This cave music reminds me of the cave music from Xenoblade Chronicles
[3:53:56] <+Moaradin> monkaS
[3:54:00] <+CapnClassix> Armos
[3:54:04] <heartlesshealer> wow
[3:54:07] <Ryong> this kills the pat
[3:54:10] <%Dakuu75> this looks like a big-fat-NOPE room
[3:54:10] <%vivaldiva> we dem boys
[3:54:13] <+AlucardX60> You have entered the blender.
[3:54:14] <+Catpurnicus> look at this link to the past boss
[3:54:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Now the question is: Do same cog effects stack?
[3:54:27] <+tempestzephyr> very zelda
[3:54:59] <%Dakuu75> dog is actually doing work
[3:55:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> GUN
[3:55:13] <+fetrigon> fuuuuuck
[3:55:13] <SaltyAzteca> DEATH
[3:55:14] <stevenellis386> GG FAM
[3:55:20] <heartlesshealer> F
[3:55:20] <cthulu_fearlock> oof
[3:55:32] <SaltyAzteca> D:
[3:55:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> Flameblade time?
[3:55:42] <cthulu_fearlock> stress level increasing
[3:55:45] <%greasypete00> the more you interact with the dog the better they get
[3:55:57] <Ryong> which one of you wants to learn a mechanic pat doesn't know
[3:56:08] <+AlucardX60> The adds feel like a bit much in this fight.
[3:56:09] <%blastyoboots> must pet
[3:56:31] <%ennui_on_me> I think the adds are there so you can get more syringes from beating em
[3:56:38] <Ryong> the dog gets annoyed if you do too much
[3:56:45] <Ryong> time for more mind goblins
[3:56:48] <scrumbotime> That's him, dril
[3:57:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> DrilTweets???
[3:57:07] <Ryong> I'd like to point out that Alma is portuguese for "Soul"
[3:57:45] <Ryong> so you can dig ANYWHERE IN THE GAME
[3:58:08] <Explodincatz> time to dig up every tile
[3:58:16] <%Dakuu75> I like how he doesn't ask for help to get outa here, he's like, "here, take this shit." lol
[3:58:19] <Ryong> these are the hints
[3:58:22] <Ryong> figure them out
[3:58:24] <+acridpaladin> ohgod
[3:58:26] <SaltyAzteca> X marks da spot
[3:58:36] <ennui_on_me> If you max out your relationship with Drill-o the game turns into Tetsuo: The Iron Man
[3:58:39] <Ryong> yeah it's bullshit
[3:58:50] <+FluffNir> i'm sure chat got you
[3:59:06] <Ryong> pat jump on a box
[3:59:16] <%Logoth_> this music is too smooth
[3:59:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> got more than enough for that flame blade
[3:59:34] <SaltyAzteca> CASH MONEY
[3:59:36] <+tempestzephyr> Sword time
[3:59:38] <heartlesshealer> you did it
[3:59:52] <%Dakuu75> the music is calm, to help you not panic over the time limits lol
[4:00:24] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype YOOOOO
[4:00:38] <Ryong> flameblade is OP
[4:00:46] <Ryong> but costs AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY to upgrade
[4:01:03] <$CrownlessKitty> fair tradeoff
[4:01:15] <Ryong> like upgrading the axe is something like 600 plus mats
[4:01:17] <SaltyAzteca> That LoZ fall LUL
[4:01:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> That falling sound is JUST like the one in Goof Troop LUL
[4:01:29] <kinkade_77> nice ost
[4:01:30] <Ryong> upgrading the flame blade gives less of an increase and costs uh 2~4k?
[4:02:03] <%JumboCrunchies> I just got here, before I zip off to the watch the VoD from the beginning, wanted to know what Chat/Pats opinion of the game was so far?
[4:02:04] <kinkade_77> this is like the zelda link to past game ive always wanted
[4:02:06] <+pectusumbra> oh hey, it's armos knights
[4:02:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> USE YOUR FF14 SKILLS, PAT
[4:02:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> READ THE CIRCLES LUL
[4:02:12] <stevenellis386> DAMN SON
[4:02:16] <+fetrigon> too much on screen
[4:02:19] <Ryong> @JumboCrunchies I beat it and I think it's fantastic
[4:02:20] <%RealThiele> adds
[4:02:21] <Jerp> this fight is amazingly intense lol
[4:02:22] <%skizzuto> focus the adds maybe?
[4:02:37] <bigshedman> @JumboCrunchies So far it looks fucking stellar.
[4:02:39] <+pectusumbra> looks like spin attack is the answer
[4:02:54] <+pectusumbra> can deflect all the shots and AoE the trash
[4:03:01] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa oh fuck
[4:03:02] <+FluffNir> it would be cute if the dog helped find dig spots
[4:03:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> MECHA SHIVA!?
[4:03:09] <heartlesshealer> it's more that he seems to be getting hit by the adds while he's doing the parry thing
[4:03:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> @JumboCrunchies From what I've seen, I can totally see why people are calling this the best Metroidvania of this year
[4:03:38] <sauceboss310> F
[4:03:41] <%YakumoYomi> F
[4:03:45] <+fetrigon> jesus
[4:03:55] <%Movemeister> F
[4:03:58] <SaltyAzteca> And thats what matters most
[4:04:18] <heartlesshealer> bury pat with his money
[4:04:32] <+pectusumbra> I guess this is one of those games like Covenant of the Plume that just expects you to bad end the first time and go back for another round
[4:04:32] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:04:43] <+fetrigon> looks like a passive agressive style fight
[4:04:49] <%ennui_on_me> nice double parry there
[4:05:15] <M0untain_wolf> Mecha Shiva?
[4:05:33] <$CrownlessKitty> mecha shiva
[4:05:39] <EASrake> just let the dog do all the work
[4:05:46] <SaltyAzteca> Mecha Shiva! Mecha Shiva! Mecha Shiva!
[4:05:51] <+fetrigon> ooooh
[4:05:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dog is doing like, half your damage, damn LUL
[4:05:53] <Ryong> @pectusumbra yes but you can also turn the game to be easier with time limits
[4:05:57] <mudox1717> lol
[4:06:03] <heartlesshealer> neat
[4:06:11] <$CrownlessKitty> shame i can't read sanskrit
[4:06:14] <%justcallmebobplease> CONTROL ITS PATH!?
[4:06:22] <Ryong> YES
[4:06:29] <LucasNazatoArt> Shuriken is rad
[4:06:29] <Explodincatz> ninja deathstar?!
[4:06:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man, this robit be kitted up.
[4:06:31] <%justcallmebobplease> INCREDIBLE
[4:06:33] <MaybeFalco> sick
[4:06:34] <Ryong> puzzle solver
[4:06:36] <$CrownlessKitty> oh fuck that's cool
[4:06:36] <+Moaradin> dope
[4:06:44] <stevenellis386> yea, like I mentioned earlier. Dogs are op
[4:06:46] <%RealThiele> believe it
[4:06:53] <heartlesshealer> RC Shuriken is fun
[4:06:56] <kinkade_77> ds zelda boomerang
[4:07:16] <+AlucardX60> Looks like you can also use it to scout areas
[4:07:25] <+fetrigon> LUL
[4:07:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> is a flute the chillest instrument ever made?
[4:07:59] <DensityD> Dear Pixels, why are you so good and cool? Love, DensityD
[4:08:00] <%justcallmebobplease> @ReallyBigRocks Sax and Piano, when slow, can also achieve absurd chill.
[4:08:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, Harmonica is the chillest.
[4:08:21] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[4:08:26] <+AlucardX60> Chill bass?
[4:08:50] <%justcallmebobplease> @Zaphire_Saucypants Humming is more chill than a harmonica, if we're going that route - get that barbershop quartet going.
[4:09:17] <SaltyAzteca> This track reminds me of Doctrine Dark
[4:09:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @justcallmebobplease my thought process was more like...harmonica, to me at least, is the epitome of "just vibin' bro."
[4:09:43] <+pectusumbra> yo can I also just say this game's Aesthetic is AWESOME
[4:09:47] <Explodincatz> thanks Navi
[4:09:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Anyone in chat ever listen to Khraungbin? similar vibes
[4:10:13] <DensityD> robot is good robot
[4:10:19] <%ennui_on_me> Harmonica has a chill vibe, but the sound itself isn't as chill as piano. It just has chill associations.
[4:11:06] <%ShogunNoonto> So does the time thing mean you can be in a dead game
[4:11:07] <%RaziWraith> Heart go up!
[4:11:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> dogheeart ho up
[4:11:28] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah I'd smack Alma with my rod too
[4:11:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> "Almost smacked you with my rod!" Oh my  O_O
[4:11:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh man i butchered that one LUL
[4:12:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's nice.
[4:12:08] <%blastyoboots> HECK YES TIME STOPS
[4:12:11] <Louie_Salmon> It has fishing, and is therefore a masterpiece
[4:12:13] <Ryong> @ShogunNoonto you can absolutely have no time enough to do stuff
[4:12:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> ZA WARUDO?
[4:12:22] <kinkade_77> if time didnt stop during fishing thatd be rough
[4:12:28] <+fetrigon> sure is
[4:12:32] <%RaziWraith> ZA FISHIDO!?
[4:12:47] <heartlesshealer> yay
[4:12:51] <Ryong> Pat, please, I beg of you: grab a box.
[4:12:53] <Daxalog> Excellent like youll keep playing Excellent? Or Excellent like "its good". Excellent?
[4:12:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, do you see why people are hyping it now?
[4:13:05] <stormhawk9891> So how do you feel about the time limit so far
[4:13:05] <%Dakuu75> can you have more than one dog at the same time? Just run with a pack?
[4:13:20] <Ryong> @Dakuu75 I don't think so
[4:13:25] <luciluxlu0> I should go back and beat this game.
[4:13:28] <Ryong> I never tried, though
[4:13:44] <%RaziWraith> meteor dust radar?
[4:13:59] <Ryong> YOUR WORST ENEMY
[4:14:13] <%Dakuu75> revenge~!
[4:14:26] <Explodincatz> dog just kills the clones ez
[4:14:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Watch Pat never use the dust.
[4:14:49] <Ryong> there is not
[4:15:02] <%ennui_on_me> The problem is knowing who you wanna use the dust on
[4:15:17] <%ennui_on_me> and nobody's close to death yet
[4:15:44] <%RaziWraith> seeing as Navi stand in is the one with the least amount of time.  Pat will never remember about dust. Kappa
[4:15:45] <+Moaradin> FeelsBadMan
[4:15:46] <%Dakuu75> the goblins are now attacking...
[4:15:47] <Ryong> teresa is close
[4:15:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> indecision!
[4:15:49] <+acridpaladin> i was wondering when theyd push that
[4:15:50] <%greasypete00> oh no
[4:15:52] <Daxalog> Teresa is on her final hours
[4:15:53] <%justcallmebobplease> TERESE!
[4:15:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Is this where the goblins begin?
[4:15:56] <Ryong> and by close 72 hours
[4:16:13] <%justcallmebobplease> Teresa is T-minus not even a minute and a half.
[4:16:14] <Ryong> ooooh this spot

[4:16:23] <Explodincatz> fire hot
[4:16:29] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, big premise was lots of npcs having a time limit
[4:16:34] <Ryong> hearts are relationship meter
[4:16:42] <%RaziWraith> dog almost carried the fight :(
[4:17:02] <+AlucardX60> This is gonna be real awkward when navi died.
[4:17:08] <Ryong> oh god i just remembered a mechanic oh god oh shit
[4:17:38] <%RaziWraith> Goes to pet dog, impales dog head monkaS
[4:17:38] <%ennui_on_me> Tobias's dream: to pet you
[4:17:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> SO I'm guessing there are 4 dogs.
[4:17:47] <%Dakuu75> I don't know if dogs could survive on jsut apples...
[4:18:06] <%ennui_on_me> maybe edward scissorhands shouldn't run an animal rescue
[4:18:06] <Jerp> they're meat apples
[4:18:10] <Ryong> @Dakuu75 brazil has wolves that do that
[4:18:29] <%Dakuu75> @Ryong oh, damn. lol
[4:18:35] <Ryong> there is a chip store there.
[4:18:35] <%AgniBrandt> Chips not cogs

[4:19:49] <%Dakuu75> GREED lol
[4:19:52] <@SoFarFetched> geefBush are we mind goblining it up tonight?
[4:19:55] <Ryong> so if you max out someone's relationship meter they give you something
[4:19:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> high risk high reward
[4:19:57] <+AlucardX60> Grinding chip
[4:20:00] <%notsoy> i assume you can't use that and the wallet chip at the same time?
[4:20:00] <%RaziWraith> THE RISK INVESTMENT!
[4:20:00] <+acridpaladin> can you wallet greed?
[4:20:02] <Ryong> and you do that by giving them dust
[4:20:05] <+pectusumbra> how does it work with wallet though?
[4:20:06] <%justcallmebobplease> BIG RISK
[4:20:08] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt That stacks with chips that decrease chips lost
[4:20:11] <heartlesshealer> it wouldn't even work if you stole it now
[4:20:12] <$Rancaliber_> coneyPAYOUT GREED coneyPAYOUT
[4:20:13] <%spitelite> big greed
[4:20:13] <+cubbywolf> greed chip

[4:20:34] <%DedlokPM> Greed psaGoblin
[4:20:38] <%AgniBrandt> Correct
[4:20:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Will that work?
[4:20:42] <Ryong> there are many builds
[4:20:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Test it to find out
[4:20:50] <sirtommygunn> is this a hyper light drifter
[4:20:58] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[4:20:59] <heartlesshealer> time for pat to learn no death
[4:21:07] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats fair

[4:21:34] <heartlesshealer> !!!!!!!
[4:21:35] <+pectusumbra> YEAH BABY, That's what we wanna see
[4:21:35] <+AlucardX60> Good game
[4:21:40] <sun312772> hot
[4:21:42] <%notsoy> wallet + greed
[4:21:42] <%ennui_on_me> I just assumed that wouldn't work in my run, goddamn
[4:21:43] <%RaziWraith> Hold up. so you don't lose chips on death even with risk chip? LUL
[4:21:44] <$Rancaliber_> The loophole has been found.
[4:21:49] <+pectusumbra> I mean that old lady is about to die right now
[4:21:51] <heartlesshealer> greed punishment nullified holy shit
[4:21:52] <%MooseIsGoose> does it break
[4:21:53] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[4:21:53] <Ryong> Pat
[4:21:57] <%JoshManVGH> So what IS the Goblin Part?
[4:22:00] <+cubbywolf> goblins win
[4:22:09] <+fetrigon> for sure
[4:22:09] <Ryong> there is one very powerful goblin effect about routing
[4:22:13] <Ryong> which is boxes.
[4:22:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh dang, I came back at the end, what happened?
[4:22:23] <%ennui_on_me> @JoshManVGH characters die after a set amount of time, you can add time with limited items
[4:22:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RaziWraith he combined the greed with the wallet effect.
[4:22:34] <+cubbywolf> 180 hours is more than 3
[4:22:34] <moonmintparadise> new guilty gear character has just been shown :)
[4:22:38] <+meattube1> @PatStaresAt would return of the obra dinn be a good mind goblin game?
[4:22:41] <Explodincatz> i can SMELL it over the hill
[4:22:42] <%DedlokPM> @JoshManVGH everyone, including you, has a death clock timer and you can extend that timer with a limited resource
[4:22:44] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:22:57] <+pectusumbra> You did say you had an extra two weeks to fill
[4:23:00] <sirtommygunn> its not a goblin game, its just good
[4:23:07] <+cubbywolf> look at Pat's magnificent hair sprouting out everywhere... kinda
[4:23:17] <%DedlokPM> @JoshManVGH oh, and its a timer PER PERSON. And the timers are different
[4:23:17] <+cubbywolf> it looks god bro
[4:23:19] <+RandyFistburgers> You beat it and it got super hard you say??
[4:23:19] <Psyramics> werent you griping on twitter about not knowing what to do for the next 3 weeks?
[4:23:20] <%Monkeyweed21> just put every death on the captain
[4:23:22] <+cubbywolf> except for the part that doesnt
[4:23:23] <Fenlig> Obra Dinn Music is amazing
[4:23:28] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:23:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> the curliest comb-over ever
[4:23:34] <heartlesshealer> obra dinn is less goblin and more searching
[4:23:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wish there were more games like Obra Dinn. Or at least more installments or scenarios to investigate in the same universe.
[4:23:36] <sirtommygunn> Play "We Were Here Together" with Paige if you have separate computers
[4:23:38] <+cubbywolf> the pasta rat cosplay
[4:23:38] <%maenos2> eww combover
[4:23:55] <%Dakuu75> Watching Pat has made me more comfortable with going bald.
[4:24:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> So what are your thoughts on the game?
[4:24:20] <+cubbywolf> i like the art
[4:24:34] <%Dakuu75> soft goblins
[4:24:42] <%ennui_on_me> it looks beautiful yeah
[4:24:44] <%captain_thickthighs> Pat's starting to look like Van Gogh before you started to walk in the ocean
[4:24:45] <@Ranryu692> "Tangent" is your middle name
[4:24:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt is Hitman gobliny or is it replayable enough that you dont have to perfect it on the first run
[4:25:05] <kinkade_77> fighting ludwig right now and i HATE it
[4:25:15] <+cubbywolf> i told my friend to buy ds3 and he bought it and faced the first boss and gave up, but I love that game
[4:25:26] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:26:22] <+fetrigon> LUL
[4:26:22] <%baka_sugoi> able ppl only
[4:26:24] <@Ranryu692> that's a fantastically interesting point
[4:26:34] <Treasure_Vault> I think it's cool that everyone beats the same game. It's not DMC what difficulty did you do it on
[4:26:50] <%blastyoboots> mhmm
[4:26:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Souls doesnt need easy mode it needs good colorblind and text size options
[4:27:03] <stevenellis386> me too
[4:27:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah it's great that they recognize that their vision might push away players that would otherwise like the game.
[4:27:17] <%JoshManVGH> SMT5 has a bonus babby mode you can download, and that's fine.
[4:27:23] <bigshedman> @Monkeyweed21 It doesn't NEED it but why not add it?
[4:27:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, I have had people ask Loopy Lore to have a 1 minute timer, to which I reply "sure, you have a phone, don't you? Try it that way."
[4:27:24] <JacklongKondur> D:
[4:27:25] <+cubbywolf> I've always felt gaming was very 'able bodies' even more so than some sports
[4:27:25] <%baka_sugoi> yummm
[4:27:27] <%nicoleymcquack> am FULL
[4:27:35] <Treasure_Vault> On the other hand, they have to eat burger king
[4:27:50] <%AgniBrandt> It does feel kinda similar to HLD though
[4:28:04] <%ennui_on_me> Pathologic 2 is a game where the "vision" is basically the entire point of the game, and it still had all the options to tone it all down if you really wanted to
[4:28:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @bigshedman im not against it particularly but if it doesnt have one who cares
[4:28:13] <EynoStiles> not every game needs easy modes.
[4:28:15] <%MooseIsGoose> it was
[4:28:42] <%ForlornCarton> ForlornCarton subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Hey Pat, FF14 question for you.  Should you level up trust members for Endwalker?
[4:28:54] <+DeRedBaron> i hate the survivor AI in 1 cus they are really stupid, and in 2 they are really smart, and Off the record they did alter that too i believe
[4:28:59] <sirrice77> i remember when i tried to get that achievement and i couldn't because i didn't know 8 was the max amount of survivors
[4:29:08] <bigshedman> @Monkeyweed21 Eh I think it would help get more people into certain games, generally an audience that doesn't play games much or whatever. But that's coming from someone who sees no point in games NOT having easy modes in most cases.
[4:29:16] <Jerp> Pay if you've got mega hardware, OBS does support dual encoding -- stream at 1080/60 and record at 4k/60
[4:29:19] <%captain_thickthighs> what is an immersive sim I thought people just use RPG
[4:29:24] <%justcallmebobplease> DUDE IF TRU...
[4:29:24] <Jerp> Pat* fuck this keyboard
[4:29:32] <heartlesshealer> what
[4:29:34] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> NotLikeThis
[4:29:43] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> i refuse to believe this
[4:29:51] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> this is the biggest reach it has to be
[4:29:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> FF14 is a wild ass game, because I've been playing it for MONTHS and y'all keep saying "oh yeah I scrimbloed the blimbloed mechanic today" and I swear it sounds like a completely different game.
[4:29:54] <whycantipostasguest> believe what
[4:30:11] <%MooseIsGoose> believe what
[4:30:18] <%ennui_on_me> Breath of the Wild is literally the same game as System Shock 2 if you think about it
[4:30:31] <Jerp> I don't have the upstream bandwidth for 1080/60 and twitch only goes to 6mbps so I just do 720/60 at 6mbps to twitch and then 1080@60 saved locally for editing/youtube
[4:30:39] <%captain_thickthighs> breath of the wild is just Skyrim but anime
[4:30:48] <%ForlornCarton> Good to know
[4:30:53] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt also are your old crafter guides you did for shadowbringers still relevant?
[4:31:00] <kinkade_77> hows smtv so far
[4:31:08] <homestylewaffles> they get an extra costume
[4:31:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Breath of the Wild is the Crash Bandicoot of Dark Souls
[4:31:21] <%AgniBrandt> @ennui_on_me At least in System Shock 2 I can prevent my weapons from breaking
[4:31:25] <%ennui_on_me> SMTV is the Dark Souls of Persona
[4:31:38] <+Cecrios> 23 hour upload time
[4:31:46] <Jerp> yeah dual encoding is SO demanding.  I can only BARELY do it
