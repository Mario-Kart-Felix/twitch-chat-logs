[0:06:55] <%Jekado> Cheer500 Hi Pat! So I finished Yakuza 6 last night, boy that game is definitely not the best Yakuza game, The story was okay but it felt like a tech demo for the dragon engine not a true Yakuza game, like its weird to compare it to Kiwami 2 which came out like a year later. Things like missing mini games and Kamurocho not being fully explorable felt like it wasn't finished, wasn't a terrible game but wasn't great. Still excited and ready for 7!
[0:06:56] <%Kyoshikei> welcome home Peach!!

[0:33:34] <%twistedj3ster> because no one else will
[0:33:35] <Oxybe> Shellmo on a sabbatical from streaming
[0:33:36] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Tell Paige not to worry, I have proof she's going to live a long life. If the Grim Reaper hasn't caught up to her yet it must be because he finds it awkward to get hit on at work. He's probably going to drag this out as long as possible
[0:33:40] <%Monkeyweed21> not since Shellmo did that racist rant
[0:33:41] <clockworknait1> @skyentombment thats a crazy high increase
[0:33:51] <skeletrail> Pat you must buy her the Skeleton so she can heal!
[0:33:57] <$happyface699> Shellmo sexually assaulted those women

[0:34:41] <Oxybe> Shellmo has to take a month off because he said pro taiwan stuff and the china got super pissed
[0:34:49] <clockworknait1> @skyentombment maybe they are gouging now or sick of highlights, probably gouging lol
[0:34:51] <+RhaskaFyraska> i think theyre the people who do all the database stuff in libraries
[0:35:00] <dabeaminator> The fact that you need a specific college degree to work at a library is bullshit.

[0:39:24] <%Keaton_x> @clockworknait1 No idea. I think Pat just didn't like all the highlights (and I think people were highlighting spoilers?) so he upped the cost so it couldn't be done as often.

[0:40:00] <Chatterbox1991> them
[0:40:01] <arkv01> pat gets ALL the pussy while his brother gets broken teeth

[0:40:54] <a_mad_dragon> how would he afford meth? SoonerLater

[1:05:16] <%DianaTheAscian> I've done it at least 10 times
[1:05:18] <T_Sasquatch> no , because Im black PogChamp
[1:05:19] <+glgzephyr> he's run on hard times these days
[1:05:20] <%Jekado> he has a name is Mr Moneybags...
[1:05:20] <bob900000> yup
[1:05:22] <%heartlesshealer> it was the famous Milton Bradley
[1:05:22] <+aslfrasle> I remember once I went to do groceries and one of the grocery workers was wearing a jedi robe, a weird amulet, and an Infinity Gauntlet while he was fetching carts.
[1:05:23] <tylerdojadaygermaine> i had a good friend turn from a Satanist in to a flat earther. they also believed in lizard people.
[1:05:24] <+glgzephyr> Monopoly Man is pretty unpopular
[1:05:25] <$realm_forge> Like drunk people at the airport
[1:05:29] <%driemen> driemen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:05:32] <%s1rcuit> the only crystals that can affect you without putting them in your body are irradiated
[1:05:35] <rekinom> Karen I know I lost boardwalk but it is my legal right to talk to my kids
[1:05:35] <+redambulant> The worse is when they're like "THIS IS MY STOP TOO!"
[1:05:36] <%Littlecjmajor> i had a man grab my hand ask to see my feet on train once

[1:09:41] <tanarath> god

[1:09:48] <%DianaTheAscian> what is this game anyway?
[1:09:50] <+glgzephyr> she is extremely high
[1:09:54] <@PeachSaliva> @tanarath my fault dear. He will start soon.
[1:09:56] <tanarath> The content I follow for.
[1:09:57] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Maybe the true caca was the Poo poo we made along the way
[1:10:01] <$happyface699> Very high
[1:10:06] <VritraReiRei> @DianaTheAscian It doesn't help that on more than one occasion when they go off camera Paige is *completely* honest what happened...
[1:10:07] <+glgzephyr> oh no she sees
[1:10:17] <$happyface699> @nigelschnauzerpug Yes
[1:10:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what IS discworld?
[1:10:25] <tanarath> @peachsaliva Never be sorry, the game can wait.
[1:10:27] <RyuuAoi> @dianatheascian No game. Peach just got REALLY high and streamed it.
[1:10:37] <%Anime_Flux> Hope they sent you home with the Good Stuff, Paige
[1:10:38] <$happyface699> Paige needs to heal
[1:10:41] <@SoFarFetched> Paige was playing the game this entire time Kappa
[1:10:41] <+glgzephyr> Discworld is a book series by Terry Pratchett
[1:10:47] <@PeachSaliva> @anime_flux boy did they!
[1:10:48] <$happyface699> @anime_flux Weeeed
[1:10:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> so Pat is weinering Paige right
[1:10:53] <+glgzephyr> It is extremely high quality and easy to read
[1:10:53] <%DianaTheAscian> No game only Pets for the baby
[1:11:00] <RyuuAoi> Paige will be here! In spirit!
[1:11:00] <%Anime_Flux> silver linings!
[1:11:01] <$RealThiele> a good discworld game would be hype
[1:11:10] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva dont be sorry, you know the best time in the stream is when you both are NOT playing a game!
[1:11:13] <$LegendGHT> I don't think the doctor recommends that
[1:11:14] <$happyface699> Paige is taking all the drugs
[1:11:21] <%SvenHolgersson> SvenHolgersson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! WELCOME HOME PAIGE. Good to hear you you broke out of the hospital because you're just so damned strong. Give that birthday boy big pets for me. Keep on keeping on!
[1:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> morphine up the b urgers
[1:11:33] <$happyface699> The best parts of stream are not gaming
[1:11:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How much Mustard did they inject paige with at the hospital?
[1:11:43] <%DianaTheAscian> true
[1:11:45] <%ShineTheDiamond> True
[1:11:47] <$realm_forge> Only the best hardcore narcotics for @peachsaliva
[1:11:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> all of it
[1:11:54] <%Anime_Flux> I bet Gief went nuts when she walked in
[1:11:56] <$happyface699> @nigelschnauzerpug They didnt have enough
[1:12:00] <%DianaTheAscian> all of it
[1:12:07] <Arisato_II> Not even religious, but I'll keep Paige in my prayers for extremelly fast recover
[1:12:08] <Profmcstevie> I hope the sponsors are well researched in Pats usual hour before playing vidya game
[1:12:09] <$happyface699> Gief probably freaked
[1:12:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> morphine up the butthole is probably more effective than I imagine
[1:12:14] <$LegendGHT> back in time for peepee's birthday!
[1:12:15] <tanarath> paige, why didn't you get them to give you weed?
[1:12:19] <Parapattern> Heinz spreadable morphine sauce
[1:12:27] <%Anime_Flux> He SPD'd Pat in celebration
[1:12:28] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva Do you ship internationally? HolidayPresent
[1:12:30] <dabeaminator> Guys I'm dipping strawberries in melted nutella and I feel like a horrible pig but it tastes so good help me
[1:12:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> instead of being 70% water, paige is 70% mustard now
[1:12:42] <@SoFarFetched> I thought paige was always mustard
[1:12:45] <$happyface699> @tanarath They didnt have enough of that either
[1:12:45] <@PeachSaliva> @tanarath oh I have plenty of weed at home. They gave me something way stronger for the pain
[1:12:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Isn't Nutella already a spread?
[1:12:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How do you melt it?
[1:12:54] <@SoFarFetched> was this a lie? geefThink
[1:12:55] <$LegendGHT> the mustard transfusion is complete
[1:13:06] <%DianaTheAscian> u mean mustard is Paige?
[1:13:09] <%ShineTheDiamond> @dabeaminator Did you bring enough to share? That sounds fucking delicious
[1:13:09] <RyuuAoi> AYYYYE
[1:13:28] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Paige is the real Mustard smoker.
[1:13:30] <$happyface699> Paige is never mustard only the consumer of it
[1:13:37] <%twistedj3ster> so like, are you just gonna get better over time or did they fix something?
[1:13:37] <dabeaminator> Just put it in the microwave in a little bowl for like ten seconds.
[1:13:40] <$realm_forge> Paige only takes the BIGGEST drugs
[1:13:43] <dabeaminator> And yes I will share
[1:13:45] <Arisato_II> We are what we eat
[1:13:47] <%WhereIsWill> paige has unlocked UNLIMITED DRUG
[1:13:47] <@SoFarFetched> Paige was the mustard we needed all along
[1:13:51] <$happyface699> Paige did mustard before it was cool
[1:14:08] <@PeachSaliva> @twistedj3ster they did do some stuff, but we are going to do a few weeks of ‚Äúactive rest‚Äù along with a physical therapist
[1:14:09] <RyuuAoi> @dabeaminator I'll put something in a little bowl for ten seconds. KappaPride
[1:14:14] <$happyface699> Paige sold mustard to kids on corners
[1:14:21] <%DianaTheAscian> its sounds like the hospital only put Piage on a bunch of drugs and sent her off
[1:14:29] <MyNameIsRasus> They gave @PeachSaliva Weed 2: Electric Boogaloo
[1:14:32] <$happyface699> To make the kids stronk
[1:14:34] <%Calek> sipsipHellmo Paige is back
[1:14:37] <@PeachSaliva> @dianatheascian nah, they did some stuff to my spine
[1:14:41] <$happyface699> @mynameisrasus DAMN STRAIGHT
[1:14:42] <%WhereIsWill> wheres my bag o drugs chat?!
[1:14:43] <dots4eyes> "Active rest" ey? LUL
[1:14:44] <$LegendGHT> @DianaTheAscian Ideal hospital visit if you ask me
[1:14:46] <%twistedj3ster> I hope it helps and you're out of pain soon!
[1:14:55] <%DianaTheAscian> @PeachSaliva oh okay
[1:14:55] <%weissguard> But yeah, it may not be THE thing that solves problems, but being in high spirits cause you're home instead of in a hospital bed is bound to make things better. Wish for a speedy recovery.
[1:15:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, did our McDonalds energy help?
[1:15:01] <$happyface699> @whereiswill Put it in your trashcan outback
[1:15:25] <@PeachSaliva> @commandersqueaks so much! thank you!

[1:20:52] <+Pyroclase> bottom disc?
[1:20:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Abilities cost tie
[1:21:21] <Arisato_II> The fact that you have to die makes you wonder if you're actually winning
[1:21:23] <VritraReiRei> Like the old SPFP saying: TIME STOP
[1:21:28] <Daxalog> @PatStaresAt Remember: Your abilities use up your time. Some of the later ones eat a whole second or more
[1:21:31] <thelonechris> Long hard discs

[1:23:27] <%walternatorz> Is this Grynewaht extreme, @PatStaresAt ?
[1:23:38] <%bevyrage> pat use your dash! also apparently using abilities eats time so you can somehow go negative with them
[1:23:42] <$happyface699> YOU CAN DO IT PAT
[1:23:43] <%SvenHolgersson> The backdown is real

[1:37:49] <%miabyte> is this the prequel to Disc World?
[1:37:49] <%twistedj3ster> Pat I have a suggestion. Avoid the discs in the room
[1:37:50] <%tonfirean> turntable territory
[1:37:58] <+Fep3> is this hardcore snake?
[1:38:00] <Noogiez> there sure are a lot of discs in that room
[1:38:11] <Daxalog> Did you have your coffee yet?
[1:38:29] <%DianaTheAscian> mk9?
[1:38:29] <%Monkeyweed21> a shitstorm game
[1:38:51] <+b_aleph> @Daxalog actually, the pee is stored in solid form and then is liquified to leave the body. So it's like a layer of flesh covering a pee lollipop

[1:39:04] <MyNameIsRasus> smooth like a disc
[1:39:07] <clockworknait1> like he's seriously just running into the disc's most the time, they aren't running into him
[1:39:07] <EmptyFist> It was from an edgy shitstorm game
[1:39:17] <akitanito> why
[1:39:17] <MyNameIsRasus> disc room sounds like the title of a junji ito story
[1:39:17] <%miabyte> so close
[1:39:19] <Arisato_II> I don't think your brain is at fault here, Patto
[1:39:20] <%arancet> I take exception to this game, the name "disc room" CLEARLY implies there would only be a singular disc within the room. This is absurd.
[1:39:29] <dots4eyes> Abandon human...become disc room
[1:39:51] <%tonfirean> yeah like a car race has only one car
[1:39:58] <BlkFlameKami> be like water
[1:40:04] <Arisato_II> What happens in the disc room, stays in the disc room

[1:58:01] <Bigyanno> so gold is good!
[1:58:03] <Mrrccava> I just got here like a nurd. WHAT THE HELL IS THID
[1:58:09] <Mrrccava> he's this
[1:58:14] <Mrrccava> FUCK
[1:58:15] <%josstyl_0> you should check your disc facts
[1:58:17] <SeriouslyClara> disc room
[1:58:17] <%tonfirean> it's disc room
[1:58:29] <%DianaTheAscian> disc
[1:58:34] <%twistedj3ster> Orb vs. Disc
[1:58:34] <%DianaTheAscian> room
[1:58:37] <%LoneFonte> room
[1:58:41] <%ergulor> 2 in tis room
[1:58:47] <ullyzeez> among us 2 looks weird
[1:58:51] <SeriouslyClara> I'm chilling with one of my rabbits, so it's obvious Pat staring time
[1:58:59] <%josstyl_0> check the disc legend to see which ones you have yet to die to
[1:59:01] <SeriouslyClara> I usually lurk
[1:59:13] <%logoth_> So is the point of this game is getting mulched?
[1:59:16] <%kidar5> kidar5 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:59:23] <%Lizard0TM> yes

[1:59:37] <Mrrccava> chat is as helpful as normal I see. I appreciate the non-helpful info guysü§£
[1:59:40] <%tonfirean> Oh, it is Voyager for realsies
[1:59:41] <Saltmeisterr> u can solve this
[1:59:41] <Noogiez> are you supposed to collect the discs or dodge them?
[1:59:45] <Saltmeisterr> i think?
[1:59:50] <+joseph_krinsky> this game is confusing
[1:59:52] <Bigyanno> Do the lines denote the direction the discs should be going?
[1:59:52] <+fromnibelheim> rabbits are just sweet lil mushy babies
[1:59:56] <%ssjklyco> Try creating disk
[1:59:57] <%josstyl_0> you don't have the power you need yet
[2:00:11] <MyNameIsRasus> what happens if yohu manage to hit 0 in star map
[2:00:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> absorb?
[2:00:12] <Bigyanno> like there's 2 circles with lines going up so maybe both discs need to be going up and down?
[2:00:17] <%josstyl_0> you get a power later on to solve that puzzle
[2:00:25] <%Bishop_Shidux> my friend got a flemish giant over the summer, and that boy is getting biiiiiiig

[2:01:41] <penitentpendant> The real question: Disc Room vs Death Count

[2:02:36] <Gallhint> You have to wait like us common people, influencer man! Ha!
[2:02:37] <+AtlasMcCoy> why would you need a ps5 when you have disc room?
[2:02:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Microsoft is sending you an Xbox as we speak.
[2:02:41] <Psyramics> that sounded word for word like a real conversation you would have
[2:02:42] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[2:02:42] <penitentpendant> Only enough influence for one
[2:02:42] <@SoFarFetched> with the other two he's gonna give to friends depending if they have one or not already.

[2:02:58] <SeriouslyClara> I do actually have a connect technically
[2:03:01] <%Higure_yoru> Pat its because you pay people instead of offering exposure
[2:03:03] <%BigCoffee> Pat did you ask the dude on twitter giving out yakuza 7 codes for streamers and whatnot?
[2:03:05] <derekwst3> pat why do you need a ps5, you have a game with discs
[2:03:06] <SeriouslyClara> but disc room
[2:03:07] <Arisato_II> Work for a canadian newspaper
[2:03:07] <+Mottyrob> But PS5 has no games?
[2:03:10] <Mrrccava> this has super big devolver energy for sure.
[2:03:10] <Arisato_II> Easy
[2:03:13] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You don't have a PS5, but you have DiscRoom
[2:03:14] <%TheWinged7> Just get good at influencing Kappa
[2:03:15] <%twistedj3ster> My PS5 controller doesn't have drivers yet :/
[2:03:20] <%BinaryFireball> I like that it literally makes no sense to give the wapo a ps5
[2:03:25] <Jaxiis0> Pay needs a PS5 to save his not-marriage
[2:03:25] <%miabyte> will disc room be on the PS5? Kappa
[2:03:27] <%Emperor_Machinus> the true news
[2:03:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> you just need to be JackScepticEye. he has a PS5.
[2:03:30] <%walternatorz> all the influencing kids are making fun of pat
[2:03:35] <penitentpendant> You're colleagues with Frank West? I know he covers wars.

[2:06:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> a disk is storage media. a disc is a round, flat object.
[2:06:05] <%DianaTheAscian> atlus?
[2:06:05] <+echobee_tv> What the heck, you're Pat Yakuza.
[2:06:08] <+D00msDayDan> thanks atlus
[2:06:16] <%coreyyotto> Friendship ended with Pat - Microsoft is my friend now
[2:06:17] <ullyzeez> why tf would sega want to talk to a disgusting goblin
[2:06:31] <Arisato_II> If I send you a PS5, can I smooch the small canine
[2:06:38] <%twistedj3ster> I bought Yakuza because of Pat
[2:06:39] <T_Sasquatch> I literally own 0-2 because of you LUK
[2:06:40] <%miabyte> Atlus just doesn't like streamers
[2:06:42] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:06:43] <penitentpendant> So what you're saying is... we need an ORB ROOM?
[2:06:45] <%arkv01> atlus made the discroom, and discroom can unmake you
[2:06:50] <OkamiDude15> atlus would talk to angriest pat
[2:06:57] <%BigCoffee> I also bought Yakuza because of Pat
[2:07:00] <+echobee_tv> Atlus hates money.
[2:07:04] <Arisato_II> Gottem
[2:07:05] <%LoneFonte> wait, what happened?
[2:07:07] <%arkv01> haha... oh boy
[2:07:08] <Aydarkzero> whats wrong with it?
[2:07:09] <ullyzeez> yeah its not good
[2:07:09] <%Emperor_Machinus> Someone send Pat a PS2 and PS3 with a fusion card
[2:07:09] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, it's really disappointing
[2:07:12] <%Cozy90> well isnt sega getting bought out by another company or something right now?
[2:07:13] <SeriouslyClara> I'm ded
[2:07:14] <%TheWinged7> Atlus is as Atlus does
[2:07:15] <%DianaTheAscian> wa happun?
[2:07:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEAH I SAW
[2:07:16] <%arkv01> its fuckin garbage, that port
[2:07:17] <penitentpendant> At least they ported a Persona Game to PC
[2:07:17] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt considering they want people to shill their games, but not let them make a living with them, they very well might
[2:07:18] <SeriouslyClara> LUL
[2:07:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> I hate to say it but I'm still getting it
[2:07:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> wait what's wrong with it
[2:07:20] <%BinaryFireball> I bought like 3 yakuza games because of pat lol
[2:07:22] <%coreyyotto> Atlus is the US Democratic Party of game publishers
[2:07:27] <ullyzeez> bad port on switch
[2:07:27] <Noogiez> disc the room pat
[2:07:31] <%Dementedpenguin> I admit I've actually become interested in Yakuza because of at.
[2:07:36] <%Dementedpenguin> *Pat
[2:07:37] <%ssjklyco> I thought Atlus was busy not sending us Scrambles
[2:07:42] <OkamiDude15> wha happuh with the nocturne port?
[2:07:46] <Arisato_II> The Switch version falls apart and feels like the game is slowly dying after some medium effect
[2:07:47] <%miabyte> "Let's block you from showing the ending to a game that's a decade old" - Atlus probably
[2:07:54] <%josstyl_0> you can use the slow time power as a lantern that increases your vision
[2:08:04] <bleugh> disc room
[2:08:06] <%Agami23> yeah tons of problems. 30 fps, buggy and laggy menus, random aspect ratio changing in scenes
[2:08:15] <T_Sasquatch> Hell I'll end up buying 6,7 and judgement. That's 6 games pat has influenced money out of
[2:08:20] <%Lion_kun> "Pat, could you give us more details on the email? I think it's super cool that Ryu Gotuko studio credited the old channel for bringing the game to the west, you guys single handedly saved the franchise. You should have gotten a cut of the money for that."
[2:08:24] <OkamiDude15> damn man that shit sucks
[2:08:28] <%BigCoffee> Pat want me to resend you that guy who was calling for streamers to get a Yakuza 7 code? It was on twitter, worth a shot
[2:08:33] <%josstyl_0> absorb

[2:08:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> absorb?
[2:08:36] <%Laecerelius> Poop out more discs?
[2:08:43] <%miabyte> can you bring more discs in?
[2:08:44] <gamezerox> time to absorb some disks
[2:08:53] <penitentpendant> I feel like this game is the revenge of all the AOL Discs in the universe
[2:09:06] <+WhatTheFlox> so phat
[2:09:08] <%josstyl_0> absorb the cloner or the one that splits into 4
[2:09:10] <Noogiez> @miabyte you need room fist

[2:09:27] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt I sent you a picture of a Schnauzerpug on twitter pat
[2:09:27] <%ssjklyco> I would laugh if they sent him an Xbox Series X code for Yakuzies 7
[2:09:30] <%Lion_kun> 20000*
[2:09:32] <%miabyte> I'm glad Paige is home. That hospital had me worried.
[2:09:37] <jeffishype> wrong you coward, you need to start working out so you can lift him at all weights
[2:09:41] <+echobee_tv> Exactly that feel.
[2:09:42] <%DianaTheAscian> is he neutered yet?
[2:09:44] <+echobee_tv> So good.
[2:09:45] <SeriouslyClara> dog room
[2:09:47] <OkamiDude15> dogoplasmosis seeping its way into your brain
[2:09:51] <+D00msDayDan> gimme some of those good chemicals
[2:09:56] <%stephaniesadgirl> @DianaTheAscian no, Pat is not neutered, not yet.
[2:09:57] <%s1rcuit> @miabyte don't worry, the hospital will be okay

[2:10:10] <DKDiamantes> Doggo will never be too big for that, he'll just trample and suffocate you.
[2:10:11] <%DianaTheAscian> @stephaniesadgirl damn

[2:10:31] <%miabyte> oh hai DK
[2:10:33] <%coreyyotto> The sequel should be called Disc World
[2:10:34] <%ssjklyco> It's been proven Dogs can also laugh and their laughter makes other animals less stress
[2:10:36] <RyuuAoi> Hmmm
[2:10:42] <ullyzeez> @seriouslyclara no dog is room
[2:10:45] <SeriouslyClara> definition of insanity
[2:10:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Dogoplasmosis
[2:10:47] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt the dog is also getting the chemicals
[2:10:49] <%DianaTheAscian> the true disc were the rooms along the way
[2:10:49] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls

[2:16:18] <%BigCoffee> @ullyzeez a kirby fanatic
[2:16:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Giztech It's probably for the best they just do the podcast together and NOTHING else. Going into business together can fuck up friendships, as we've seen ......

[2:19:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> Matt the Disc Room
[2:19:21] <%Laecerelius> You either love Pat or hate disc room
[2:19:25] <akitanito> so close
[2:19:25] <SeriouslyClara> disc room is the true influencer
[2:19:25] <+echobee_tv> That was almost godlike
[2:19:29] <+SiameseDuck> Genuinely emotionally insincere
[2:19:30] <+lazysaiyajin> YO thats rad
[2:19:30] <+Mottyrob> Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing
[2:19:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> I want to have a type of friend that just randomly blurts out "fucking disc room"
[2:19:43] <%s1rcuit> according to Pat there's two forms of comedy: cynical and disc room
[2:19:48] <%Laecerelius> Become the room, Pat. Thread the needle!
[2:19:50] <@SoFarFetched> there can only be disc room
[2:19:57] <%josstyl_0> slowing time might be better for this room
[2:20:03] <dinnydanny777> Become as discs
[2:20:03] <akitanito> It'd be nice if you can actually see your hitbox
[2:20:06] <penitentpendant> Reminds me of that video from Stormblood where Hien stood around and did nothing for that quest
[2:20:10] <+Estuko> Is it just me or is the level 50-55 msq stuff dragging for ages
[2:20:17] <Noogiez> your not disc-ing the room correctly
[2:20:18] <OkamiDude15> who wins disc room or trap room?
[2:20:19] <Aydarkzero> just wake up early 4Head
[2:20:27] <DKDiamantes> Its a normal people schedule
[2:20:31] <+Tokanova> Why is the main character wearing a chicken suit?
[2:20:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Who's excited for the impending civil war!
[2:20:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> No time for Yakuza, more time for DiscRoom
[2:20:41] <SeriouslyClara> activating disc card
[2:20:46] <Railgun5> @PatStaresAt Read the disc codex entries in the menu
[2:20:47] <Profmcstevie> But no NORMAL person wants to be up at that time
[2:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> more like Abby Normal Kappa
[2:20:58] <%ssjklyco> he's got a point
[2:20:58] <%Laecerelius> YOU'RE A GENETIC FREAK AND YOU'RE NOT NORMAL!
[2:21:01] <Aydarkzero> i know influencers who wake up at 5am though
[2:21:04] <DKDiamantes> Fair, changing stream time to midnight and going till 6am
[2:21:05] <Mr_Strut> Some people want to live past 40
[2:21:07] <%chiazam> Pat's right
[2:21:11] <dots4eyes> Don't forget Disc Room
[2:21:12] <+AtlasMcCoy> Mornings are for losers and suckers. Night life best life
[2:21:18] <%chiazam> @DKDiamantes LETSSS GOOOO

[2:21:19] <Gallhint> Take a shot every time pat says influencer

[2:21:31] <SeriouslyClara> disc room only exists at night
[2:21:32] <T_Sasquatch> @estuko LUL you made it to level 50. Welcome to 10 levels that take the same time as 50
[2:21:33] <%DianaTheAscian> is Pat feeling Discpair for not having a ps5? @PatStaresAt
[2:21:36] <dinnydanny777> I do that anyway :)
[2:21:36] <%LoneFonte> there's the disks, and there's the rooms

[2:21:51] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Gallhint Take a shot everytime he says Disc Room
[2:21:55] <%ssjklyco> Pat should try another 24 hour stream like his FFXIV one he did years ago
[2:21:55] <%chiazam> Wait there's a dev team score
[2:22:06] <SeriouslyClara> sleeping through the night, can't relate

[2:22:15] <%DianaTheAscian> also the 3rd which can just force the body to sleep or stay awake whenever
[2:22:17] <%Emperor_Machinus> Descend into the influencer horror that is Streamer schedule madness
[2:22:17] <Noogiez> @NigelSchnauzerpug we'd all be dead
