[0:01:54] <Ner234> Ok so I haven't heard a single thing about this game. Am I just out of the loop or did this game get like no marketing at all?
[0:01:55] <CriminalMasterminds> this game is hella dope ngl

[0:02:00] <holydeviant1> granted I only got to play it every other weekend but still
[0:02:04] <+polaroidjackson> yo so i've been playing this all morning and its fucking fly as hell
[0:02:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ive seen Liam play it earlier...it was neat but seems like ur usual third person shooter with gimmick
[0:02:12] <$Ultradoom333> @ner234 its SCP
[0:02:18] <SocialMisfitGamer> The Pat Man and The Mustard Wonder. Featuring Elmo: The Big and Strong
[0:02:20] <+Double_Tap_That> montygGasp
[0:02:20] <+PatchworkSquid> garbage marketing, but it's like a high budget scp metroidvania
[0:02:20] <derekwst3> i hope the podcast gets posted tonight or tom morning
[0:02:22] <%starotter70> I know shit all about this game, so this'll be neat
[0:02:25] <mield916> it's fucking sick.
[0:02:26] <Cranky_Construct> I haven't seen Control yet
[0:02:32] <eco419> SCP like the creepy pasta stuff?
[0:02:33] <Kejang> this should be a one off
[0:02:37] <shiny_prinny> I saw one scene and it didn't look good, but everyone seems to like this game so it's probably fine
[0:02:37] <DatAsuna> pat, gib podcast plz
[0:02:39] <drops50000> I've played like an hour seems pretty cool
[0:02:47] <zoldknight> What about SCP?
[0:02:48] <blackbaron98> I might get this
[0:02:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i mean you can air dash so thats something
[0:02:50] <derekwst3> only things i know from control are what the hosting channel shown
[0:02:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Actually pretty hype to see what this game is all about
[0:02:51] <+polaroidjackson> imo it's a little less scp than people have been saying but the elements are definitely there
[0:03:01] <+SuzakuRising> only watching until he starts the game. I plan on playing this for myself when I get a chance to buy it.
[0:03:02] <blowntheguy> it's really good
[0:03:05] <Bailey__gaming> I want yo pick this up but am worried about length / replay value
[0:03:08] <mield916> the concept of scps inspired this game
[0:03:12] <SpaceGuntank> oh nice i made a stream on time, wassup chat.
[0:03:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but u seem to be mostly fighting army dudes with possession or something
[0:03:17] <holydeviant1> when the hiss touch the oops it become big whoops
[0:03:20] <%zamzoph> I'm probably gonna skip out after the donations because I prefer seeing these games for myself
[0:03:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Stumbo stream time
[0:03:26] <SocialMisfitGamer> What does SCP mean?
[0:03:28] <+PatchworkSquid> yeah, waiting for the price drop on this.

[0:20:32] <%worldbrand> @sgrim which fucking one
[0:20:32] <%depressed_skeleton> my fav SCP is probably the one that is an Alien creature living in a house & they have a scientist roommate. They're also Mega-racist against humans.
[0:20:34] <Valdorick> "And then killed the unkillable thing, and fucked a super succubus and didn't even die, because I'm such a badass, that's my SCP story"

[0:20:43] <%TaifuDragon> And it can theoretically end the world
[0:20:47] <@lewdskeletor13> @giornathan thanks for the gift subs!
[0:20:48] <Sokumotanaka> Isn't there like an immortal alligator that wants to kill humans and it has to be submerged in acid to keep at bay?
[0:20:48] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pat is also a SCP but it's called The Flesh That Hates
[0:20:49] <%TaifuDragon> Because if you don't eat the cake then you have four cakes
[0:20:49] <%hntronium> Good man Yosek
[0:20:52] <%giornathan> 👍
[0:20:53] <%hntronium> !hooker
[0:20:55] <complicatedclarity> @taifudragon I kinda want that cake
[0:20:56] <%wjones0415> yeah, SCP is trash now! it's just nothing but OP unoriginal crap charecters now.
[0:20:56] <%TaifuDragon> If you don't eat those cakes? 8 cakes
[0:20:59] <%SGrim> @worldbrand All of them, but I have a soft spot for the 0001 depiction of God guarding Eden.
[0:20:59] <%MegboyManuel> Thanks Pat <3
[0:21:03] <%TaifuDragon> Infinite cakes flooding the earth

[0:21:12] <%DexteraXIII> Stripper Cow PBoots
[0:21:12] <%TaifuDragon> Because if you eat the first cake it reappears somewhere on earth
[0:21:12] <+Menitta> The answer is no
[0:21:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sokumotanaka It's basically an infinitely adapting kaiju
[0:21:15] <noobpsyboticus> i was so hoping pat would play this game. Hopefully it{s not just a one off
[0:21:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> hahahahahahaha...die
[0:21:18] <Soul_Intern> @Sokumotanaka "Keep at bay" More like annoy it so much that he's lazy about destroying the world
[0:21:22] <%TaifuDragon> And then you have an uncontained replicating cake

[0:22:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 my favorite SCP was a toaster that forces you to refer to it as yourself, and prolonged exposure leads to you thinking you're a toaster, culminating in you inserting so much bread into yourself you choke, or try to plug yourself into an outlet.

[0:23:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @sokumotanaka yeah that's SCP-363 I think. It's basically Doomsday as an intelligent lizard. Usually if something kills it then it means shits going down. Only hard counter for it is a literal tickle monster that overwhelms it with happiness that 363 weaponizes by accident.
[0:23:08] <%InugamiTheHound> Kenny boat master extreme
[0:23:11] <simulationbard> SCP:1730 is my favorite, it's a giant Foundation Site that appeared out of no where and is full of fucked up shit running loose.

[0:24:41] <%DesertPenguin09> Gotcha
[0:24:42] <ittla> it's a playable lawyer battle anime

[0:25:00] <%arcaderabbit48> @TaifuDragon That was definitely one of the more unique articles I've read. I appreciate the ones that are interesting without outright screwing with reality, or something that could cause the apocalypse
[0:25:02] <%DesertPenguin09> Because I wasn't here earlier? Don't be a dick lol
[0:25:02] <%cureneckbeard> scp only got popular because at first it let anyone post anything and the best ones rose to the top

[0:56:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> the cutscenes are scholocky and the protagonist has rough monologues that feel bad but everything else is great
[0:56:07] <Desertfishing> this beyond two souls sequel is pretty neat
[0:56:07] <%arancet> @psydaku podcast was just released
[0:56:09] <%megabrogus> IM really upset by the face this is out now because this is the only time this year I don't have time to play it

[0:56:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @Tucker0603 SCP fanfic, the game
[0:56:35] <+CerberusDriver> but yeah this is just SCP directed by David Lynch with Metroidvania elements.
[0:56:35] <+TNT3Rays> To see the World in a grain of sand is to see life in a flower to hold a pebble in your hand is to see life in an hour

[1:08:00] <%NovaKnightmare> well no shit
[1:08:01] <AfroKing24> wtf is this game?
[1:08:05] <hottdogman> So wait, if she made up the name hiss, is she writing these files?
[1:08:08] <future_famous_person> YAY NEW GAME YAY
[1:08:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> infiniTum
[1:08:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they ver floaty
[1:08:14] <Darkrenai> Human wifi booster
[1:08:16] <hottdogman> Are the files from the future?
[1:08:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Time is convoluted
[1:08:17] <%HeadsHeldHigh> this is pretty direct information
[1:08:17] <ScreamLord> Ad Infinium is such a
[1:08:17] <+polaroidjackson> the dead people wifi
[1:08:19] <transporterthesequel> boost the WAIFI GUIS
[1:08:19] <KasiCrafter> Wifi boosters. sure?
[1:08:20] <%vaporousTippler> WiFi spores. I have a new fear.
[1:08:21] <+demon_shadowplays> wtf game is this!!!
[1:08:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> @hottdogman yes. no. maybe. I don't know.
[1:08:22] <%Doomshock> Time is convuluted...
[1:08:22] <rufus2k2> @Kataguro well she's the new director so maybe everything updates according to her will?
[1:08:22] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat WE'RE HER STAND
[1:08:26] <zoldknight> sound magic
[1:08:29] <+merylinspants> okayyy just got here how david cage-y is this?
[1:08:29] <+polaroidjackson> dad go reset the dead guy im getting mad slow downloads
[1:08:30] <Dhurkst> Human wifi, we Matrix now
[1:08:30] <Clowns> @hottdogman the files are SCPs :O
[1:08:33] <zoldknight> Probably
[1:08:37] <Jolnir> right. the pacing of this game is going to be nuts. we're going to have a lot of fun.
[1:08:37] <ScreamLord> Ad Infinium is such a good phrase
[1:08:39] <%Faustgesicht> That last line is EXTREMELY SCP
[1:08:40] <dukenux> JESSE

[1:08:42] <dukenux> WE HAVE TO COOK
[1:08:43] <+TNT3Rays> Jesse Murders
[1:08:44] <%Kataguro> That'd be cool if that's what it is
[1:08:46] <@lewdskeletor13> It seems like when she became the director the building reacts to her thoughts, so when she named it the Hiss that became its official name
[1:08:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> We need to name ourselves a Stand Name. Any ideas?
[1:08:51] <zoldknight> FUcK pLaNs
[1:08:56] <%arcaderabbit48> I think people asking where the files are coming from arent seeing the forest for the trees. The building is making the files for her, because she is the Director.
[1:08:56] <%Estuko> She has some sort of... 『P O W E R 』
[1:08:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> EMPEROR

[1:09:56] <+polaroidjackson> casper darling is a hell of a name
[1:09:57] <%NovaKnightmare> this game is just dancing around the needed exposition

[1:10:02] <%segbas2004> is it me or this game is just nonsense?
[1:10:03] <Jontman42> I'm 100% sure there fucking is a town called Ordinary in the US
[1:10:03] <%alcors_wisdom> funny as it is, it is infact a real place

[1:10:17] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think you need to oil Paige
[1:10:18] <Sokumotanaka> That's an awkward pause in the dialogue for an internal monologue.
[1:10:19] <+AntithesisEK> keeps your matter together presumably
[1:10:19] <KasiCrafter> Beyond Two Souls Ghost Stopper
[1:10:19] <dukenux> Miami?
[1:10:20] <%CopperTucker> I keep asking the same questions Pat does just seconds before
[1:10:20] <ScreamLord> Did Paige just move something?
[1:10:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Miami Hotline?
[1:10:21] <Darkrenai> Gotta find the hotline bling
[1:10:22] <Desertfishing> body movement is very robotic
[1:10:23] <Gunthertheboldest> its a bomb/failsafe device
[1:10:24] <ShichiNoBushi> It looks like a duel vest from Yu-Gi-Oh GX.
[1:10:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> If she names all the stuff, I want her to name something "Bibbity Boopy Fucky Tutty"
[1:10:28] <DSD24> @Jolnir I still hope you have fun
[1:10:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat In Alan Wake American Wasteland there was a message hidden in the song "balance slays the demon" it said "it will all end in a town called Ordinary
[1:10:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh yeah, that's just fifteen miles southwest of Anytown and due east of Citysville, right
[1:10:31] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Jolnir de facto plagarism of a massive online writing community?
[1:10:32] <Brother_Coduss> Why's she so roboty in moving?
[1:10:34] <hottdogman> is the board like heaven or something
[1:10:35] <dukenux> Corporate Ghosts WutFace
[1:10:36] <dadeaner> is the main character's name a pun this time?
[1:10:40] <Jolnir> im having so much fun
[1:10:40] <blowntheguy> these cutscenes look great
[1:10:41] <Desertfishing> characters appear to be very stiff
[1:10:44] <DSD24> The City of TOWNSVILLE
[1:10:44] <shiny_prinny> jesse's thoughts move in Jojo time
[1:10:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Another OOP
[1:10:47] <Bogart4321> @AngriestPat reality anchors?
[1:10:51] <$GoogleyGareth> Anyone have any idea the filesize of this game?
[1:10:54] <zoldknight> Pope going to reveal she's religous
[1:10:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I hate it
[1:10:55] <%SoFarFetched> As long as the Hotline is followed by the word Miami,I'm totally all in LUL
[1:10:59] <%patriotrenegade> Ordinary: that was a big OOPS
[1:11:01] <%alcors_wisdom> man is it just me or is there something kinda weird the the player character face
[1:11:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Howso? Elaborate?
[1:11:03] <shevan123> its like a more stable dead space
[1:11:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its ok
[1:11:05] <+HotBloodedHero> This game feels like an alien pretending to be a video game
[1:11:05] <%Dementedpenguin> I'm on the fence on it....
[1:11:06] <%brave_sj> If you're the director, shouldn't you have the highest level of clearance? Shouldn't you get the non-redacted files?
[1:11:10] <%king_wragles> Even though shit is going down, it's like "just a Tuesday" for these guys
[1:11:11] <shevan123> i gotta read that skip again
[1:11:13] <%connos_procrastination> Hotline Bling/miami/gay sex
[1:11:13] <mield916> 26GB on ps4
[1:11:13] <$psydaku> This reminds me of Yuppie Psycho for some reason
[1:11:14] <SoySocks> what do you think of the names for antagonistic forces, like The Hiss, or The Flood, or The Root?
[1:11:15] <DSD24> How tall is this building
[1:11:17] <Teyaric> Those are portable Gellar Fields.
[1:11:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ten bucks its a placibo
[1:11:17] <%segbas2004> is this the prequel to death stranding?
[1:11:18] <dukenux> yes you are :)
[1:11:19] <Jolnir> if the game is good and the writing is dumb. that is ok. pat played the entirety of deadly premonition and it was great. ill just skip the cutscenes.
[1:11:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> @brave_sj That's what I wanna know
[1:11:21] <Clowns> @SoFarFetched unfortunately, the Miami is followed by "2" :P
[1:11:21] <+grim_abel> THE FACT THAT YOU SAID REALITY ANCHOR
[1:11:23] <Sokumotanaka> Like the other character cuts themselves off and waits so you can have a mental short discussion. IT seems sloppy tbh
[1:11:24] <dukenux> youre here forever :)
[1:11:26] <%hntronium> Pat loves it very dry
[1:11:27] <%arcaderabbit48> @psydaku Holy shit, someone else who knows about that game
[1:11:27] <%peppertimelady> i hear a sentient mustard moving around
[1:11:28] <IminyourBase> he shot himself with a gun to make himself a ghost so he could help you fight the hiss from the beyond with his ghost telephone
[1:11:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "came from my brother" Kappa
[1:11:30] <%arancet> @AngriestPat watch the ultimate object be an "OOPSIE"
[1:11:30] <$GoogleyGareth> It's on Epic games so I can't look it up and "control file size" just gives me unrelated shit
[1:11:31] <Stoogeish> wait chat hold on, is this game made by the people behind xcom the bureau
[1:11:31] <%Nina96> does Jessie looks like shes staring off into space at all times or is it just me?
[1:11:31] <%alcors_wisdom> i thought you hated david cage games
[1:11:32] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat crazy shit is going down but this is the norm for them kind of dry?
[1:11:33] <rufus2k2> this is the Twin Peaks shit you love
[1:11:34] <+DeaconBluesClues> this is weird because the backstory, worldbuilding, lore is great, but I don't like the main character or really anyone who has spoken lines in a dialogue
[1:11:36] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat SCP-esque?
[1:11:36] <%AMajorTom> dispassionate writing
[1:11:47] <DSD24> I'm a fan of this image
[1:11:47] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I'd like to see a game that takes place in an world about as advanced as ours or more so but instead of pure technology they used Magic to advance
[1:11:48] <%GarbageNirvana> oh shit are we gonna meet Magneto
[1:11:50] <Mastigias> magic is real and it is corporate
[1:11:54] <Darkrenai> Magneto prison
[1:11:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> spoken monlogues are great though
[1:11:59] <%fredan31> i know nothing of this game and got here just now. How lost should I be?
[1:11:59] <Jontman42> As if written by a Finnish person
[1:12:00] <$psydaku> @arcaderabbit48 i know right. im stuck on the spider boss.
[1:12:01] <future_famous_person> X-Men 2 Pog
[1:12:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @AMajorTom interesting way to put it
[1:12:08] <SoySocks> just like The Twisted
[1:12:08] <dukenux> @Mastigias so were Shadowrun
[1:12:08] <zoldknight> Is that a fuggin red room
[1:12:09] <blowntheguy> love the writing in here
[1:12:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ooooh
[1:12:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> She should
[1:12:14] <LandOfTheWay> PIME TARADOX
[1:12:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> THIS IS SOMW TWIN PEAKS SHIT
[1:12:16] <noobpsyboticus> the voice acting reminds me of silent hill 2 with how stilted and dreamlike it is. If that's what they were going for I think they nailed it
[1:12:16] <complicatedclarity> I like that scientists are just throwing d class into blenders and going "hmmm so that's wha happun."
[1:12:17] <+BoomerTiro> Happens IRL too
[1:12:17] <%Ninestempest> das a hot line
[1:12:17] <%Kataguro> This reminds me of how FFX handles its story, broken up by monologues by the protagonist semi-often
[1:12:17] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how does the game feel?
[1:12:17] <Brother_Coduss> Oh god retroactive time fucking
[1:12:17] <DSD24> Pick up the phone...
[1:12:19] <shiny_prinny> did she not say she was looking for her brother or am i misunderstanding this
[1:12:19] <shevan123> since she's the director, thats what its going to be called
[1:12:21] <dukenux> TIIIRURURURU
[1:12:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The Batphone
[1:12:23] <%patriotrenegade> BATMAN!? ITS COMISSIONER GORDON
[1:12:24] <dukenux> MOSHI MOSH
[1:12:24] <+claudesavegely> look at that phone
[1:12:24] <FirearmsInstructor> Matrix vibes.
[1:12:26] <%Ninestempest> @LandOfTheWay not a time paradox, the building is an oop
[1:12:27] <Desertfishing> redrum
[1:12:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> god I love that chair
[1:12:28] <Mendin> Did it?
[1:12:28] <Blurredborderlines> We're going full Lynch
[1:12:28] <ScreamLord> It's the Power Puff Girls
[1:12:28] <Kalcom> did it?
[1:12:29] <KaseKaizer> Cray Talk Requiem PogChamp
[1:12:30] <%starotter70> oh
[1:12:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> did it???
[1:12:31] <tacoisgoods> Look at that Mind Palace
[1:12:31] <%demegodz> MOSHI MOSHI
[1:12:31] <%connos_procrastination> MOSHI MOSHI BOSSU
[1:12:33] <Jontman42> That's whete Magneto was kept
[1:12:34] <Endlesslyforgetful> i have at least ten
[1:12:35] <Brother_Coduss> how dial phone?
[1:12:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just stupid answers
[1:12:36] <derekwst3> its the president looking for batman
[1:12:36] <$MajorCrasher> She Kung Crimsoned the Hiss into existence
[1:12:37] <%abakkus> in this game you cant prove it was a glitch
[1:12:37] <ShichiNoBushi> So all these documents and lore you are collecting are post-mortem or something?
[1:12:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @psydaku The boss fights in that game are not great. Like an upscale RPGMaker horror game
[1:12:39] <%Dementedpenguin> I thought that was intentional
[1:12:40] <KasiCrafter> GUN
[1:12:40] <%alcors_wisdom> there are however stupid answers
[1:12:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MOSHI MOSHI BOSS DESU
[1:12:42] <%brave_sj> I consider that statement a challenge
[1:12:43] <$MajorCrasher> King*
[1:12:45] <+OkamiDude15> ask her the stupid question
[1:12:46] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Oldest house for oldest bois
[1:12:50] <+demon_shadowplays> hey pat how good is Ramnent?
[1:12:50] <%Kataguro> Call the Powerpuff Girls. Do it
[1:12:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Did it actually bug out? Or was it intended
[1:12:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why can't the main characters name their destructor really stupid shit?
[1:12:54] <Kalcom> What if it was like that
[1:12:55] <Paperware> Can you obtain Crazy Talk in this game?
[1:12:57] <dukenux> F
[1:12:57] <%umbypokochan> the calls are coming from inside the oldest house!
[1:12:58] <SoySocks> "hotline containment chamber" makes it sound like an SCP
[1:12:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ZACH TRENCH
[1:13:01] <%ChaosAethr> What Is Paige Doing?
[1:13:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> IS THAT YORK
[1:13:05] <%Ninestempest> I like that
[1:13:07] <%This_is_Marco> crazy talk is just another SCP
[1:13:07] <+griffball13> i love the name "the board" as a all knowing councel
[1:13:09] <Brother_Coduss> I fail myself all the time
[1:13:10] <%Ninestempest> dont fail anyone else!
[1:13:11] <$psydaku> @arcaderabbit48 i think Pat would like it tho.
[1:13:15] <%HeadsHeldHigh> EXPOSITION
[1:13:17] <ShichiNoBushi> There needs to be a mod for this game that retextures that phone with the one from Powerpuff Girls.
[1:13:19] <complicatedclarity> harsh but fair
[1:13:19] <Funkyfjord> is this still super early in the game? feels like it might be but i can't tell
[1:13:24] <+DeaconBluesClues> Girl Doppio's SCP containment breach gun adventure in Twin Peaks Hogwarts
[1:13:28] <Kalcom> OOP are just stands
[1:13:30] <DSD24> @Funkyfjord Still early
[1:13:31] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I love her dumb weird shirt
[1:13:37] <%arcaderabbit48> @psydaku Oh, absolutely. Game has problems, but it also has some serious highs.
[1:13:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Where did the BootyMash come from, Pope?
[1:13:38] <Blurredborderlines> It's the beginning
[1:13:40] <%Kataguro> Wow, yeah, her shirt is nonsense
[1:13:41] <noobpsyboticus> @Funkyfjord like 20 minutes probably
[1:13:42] <rufus2k2> @Funkyfjord YES LIKE FIRST HALF HOUR
[1:13:46] <rufus2k2> damn caps
[1:13:46] <Jolnir> the creators of this game were stoned the entire time
[1:13:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> OOPs and AWEs are more like SCPs
[1:13:50] <dukenux> Is this like a harness Tracer has?
[1:13:51] <%cureneckbeard> paige doppio
[1:13:55] <Sokumotanaka> @DeaconBluesClues I'm saying the internal monologue needs work . Cause when someone is talking to you then they cut themselves off so you can think for 5 minutes it seems awkward and weird. Especially when they do it to themselves and wait
[1:13:59] <dukenux> so they wont eaten by the Hiss?
[1:14:01] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> "Please select your next exposition."
[1:14:09] <+BoomerTiro> Yeah the disaster struck while she was working on her Tracer cosplay
[1:14:10] <%alcors_wisdom> calling my shot this is a simulation within a simulation
[1:14:12] <%This_is_Marco> the hiss literally just happened, like an hour ago?
[1:14:14] <zoldknight> The oldest house, stupid
[1:14:18] <%HeadsHeldHigh> LUL
[1:14:18] <Funkyfjord> cool thanks all
[1:14:18] <Lady_M91> Her shirt is the weirdest part of the game so far, I don't understand how it works.
[1:14:19] <blowntheguy> nah the internal monologue is dope
[1:14:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So its The Cube
[1:14:21] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Sokumotanaka I agree and its jarring. its the one thing about the writign thats weird
[1:14:28] <%Ninestempest> POP!
[1:14:32] <+AntithesisEK> perception filtering bastard house
[1:14:33] <+MadMatt2099> Hmmm... Place of Power, it's gotta be

[1:14:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Her shirt is Deus Ex as FUCK
[1:14:45] <%This_is_Marco> Probably had to hold it in place with a photo
[1:14:46] <Jolnir> ResidentSleeper
[1:14:47] <%Kataguro> OK
[1:14:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> She kinda looks like that lesbian chick from GhostBusters
[1:14:55] <koolaid_kevster> @angriestpat hey brother you're on my t.v. and the game is real low compared to you you loud bro
[1:14:56] <lambretime> This is like a tv show.
[1:14:59] <Mastigias> Okay but are "we" ?
[1:15:01] <hottdogman> GhOsT
[1:15:01] <%alcors_wisdom> lingering will
[1:15:02] <Thalchampz> yes, spooky ghost
[1:15:03] <%Dementedpenguin> This tone feels like I'm watching a Syfy channel premiere. Dunno if that's good or bad....
[1:15:04] <%floralkami> @dukenux it seems more like a frequency generator, that nullifies the hiss sound
[1:15:07] <morningmoondude> he's your Stand, lady
[1:15:07] <+polaroidjackson> is it the ghost of max payne
[1:15:09] <dukenux> yeah, but hes a ghost tho

[1:15:16] <zoldknight> I wanna be an echo when I die
[1:15:16] <ShichiNoBushi> I like effects that don't make things invisible but instead make them ignored and hard to notice.
[1:15:17] <%Estuko> OH, do you mean your 『STAND 』
[1:15:17] <Funkyfjord> thats super weird
[1:15:17] <shevan123> that sounds fucking crazy
[1:15:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> OKAY
[1:15:18] <FirearmsInstructor> THAT'S SUPER NUTS
[1:15:18] <+DeaconBluesClues> this is some batman superfirends theorizing
[1:15:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[1:15:19] <%alcors_wisdom> thats not how that works
[1:15:21] <MultipleJiggs> Science rules

[1:15:21] <%skizzuto> coolbeans
[1:15:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THATS SOME JOJO SHIT
[1:15:23] <%ColonelRozum> @Jolnir people
[1:15:23] <%vaporousTippler> Shooting people instead of studying is pretty alright.
[1:15:24] <%alcors_wisdom> THATS NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS
[1:15:26] <%arancet> the bullet is an OUTER WILDS PROBE?
[1:15:26] <%MoonObscure> sure that makes total sence
[1:15:27] <Lolcola34> oh god
[1:15:27] <Brother_Coduss> Then why isnt EVERYTHING ELSE WE'VE SHOT done that?
[1:15:28] <SpaceGuntank> just like the outer wilds!
[1:15:29] <hottdogman> also I like saying "ghost in the traditional sense" like ghosts are totally real and its no big deal
[1:15:29] <%dekkitout> Oh god is this an Outer Wilds sequel ResidentSleeper
[1:15:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Sending info 22 minutes in the past

[1:15:32] <%connos_procrastination> @GarbageQueenEllie Kate mckinnon from snl lmao
[1:15:32] <Jolnir> i hate it.
[1:15:36] <SoySocks> that's the most farfetch'd explanation, and it's probably right
[1:15:36] <RupanSen> that's actually some HxH shit

[1:16:50] <%HeadsHeldHigh> emily is our big mouth nerd waifu
[1:16:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This is kinda like a cross between SCP containment breach and the Matrix but you're Class A personnel instead of D & Neo pre-awakening. I'm also getting "Memento" movie vibes. The levels of fantastical bullshit is crazy.
[1:16:52] <ShichiNoBushi> "Safe" SCPs can still be extremely dangerous. They just can be left in a box for essentially forever and not cause problems.
[1:16:53] <%connos_procrastination> woolie knew
[1:16:53] <dukenux> It's been breached

[1:21:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Probably
[1:21:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Or like something very similar to it
[1:21:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Are they throwing a... hissy fit?
[1:21:15] <ScreamLord> Is this actually just an SCP facility? Because I'm getting SCP vibes
[1:21:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hissy~
[1:21:16] <%MelBrooksKA> @BoomerTiro And 1 play of "It's Not Unusual"

[1:21:23] <DSD24> The Grip form
[1:21:25] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat what if the jukebox is playing copyrighted music?
[1:21:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hiss~ hiss~ ;3
[1:21:27] <%GarbageNirvana> I dunno, maybe
[1:21:29] <SixthSun2> Turns out that Jukebox is being contained because of Copyrighted music
[1:21:29] <zoldknight> I wonder about the big circle room
[1:21:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> We have to rid this building of the HONKERTONKER
[1:21:39] <%cureneckbeard> is that a loot crate
[1:21:40] <mield916> there's an option to turn it off
[1:21:42] <%starotter70> @alcors_wisdom Oh please, no WutFace
[1:21:42] <+TNT3Rays> The jukebox doesnt’t play music as far as I know.
[1:21:43] <+Javaa01> There are radio shows on the radios occasionally
[1:21:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The truest fear
[1:21:46] <%Kataguro> It's a Jukebox that gets your stream claimed
[1:21:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @SixthSun2 the ultimate weapon to surpass copyright LAWS
[1:21:52] <Mastigias> Jukebox is playing sir mix a lot
[1:21:54] <%Kataguro> That's its power
[1:21:56] <%ColonelRozum> @Kataguro now thats some spooky shit
[1:21:57] <%alcors_wisdom> lol is that a disclaimer they need to start putting on the ESRB "this game contains copywrited music"
[1:21:58] <%Laecerelius> This SCP causes your videos to be muted and taken down on Youtube!
[1:21:59] <KaseKaizer> @AngriestPat this game looks pretty neat... too bad it doesn't come out for another year :)
[1:22:01] <faegbeard> If the jukebox plays copyrighted music, but nobody is around to hear it, does it still make sound?
[1:22:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> DMCA. The true evil.
[1:22:03] <rufus2k2> post it notes!
[1:22:04] <%dekkitout> The copyrighted music is coming form inside the house!
[1:22:05] <%GarbageNirvana> It's spooky~
[1:22:07] <ScreamLord> Circle Rooms with only 1 entrance are never good
[1:22:11] <Th47guy> Jukebox plays copyrighted music, the game won't let you enter because it knows you're streaming.

[1:34:40] <%starotter70> Do you think that, if a duck saw this he would call it: "Quack"
[1:34:40] <%This_is_Marco> no cover now
[1:34:46] <%walternatorz> do you think a supervisor would approve an IT req for God?
[1:34:49] <astrophizz> you unlock cover
[1:34:49] <%TDotGoat> this game is not tuned for lean
[1:34:50] <krymzen5> ahh metroid powerups i see
[1:34:51] <ShoggothLord> The Broken God!?
[1:34:51] <+razorknight> With a punch like that, who needs to dodge?
[1:34:52] <%skizzuto> gotta unlock it probably, if this is a metroid
[1:34:53] <Brother_Coduss> MAKE PE-NIS INTO ROBOT
[1:34:55] <%worldbrand> so the best part of the broken god is that its followers only want to build it to fight off something more big and evil
[1:34:55] <%peppertimelady> i think you just unlocked it @angriestpat
[1:34:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Like a Platinum game, you have to buy the Dodge skill?
[1:34:55] <%alcors_wisdom> @AngriestPat it should be R3 but yeah idk if thats unlocked yet
[1:34:57] <MsDewitts> wtf monkaS

[1:35:13] <%patriotrenegade> when do you get super powers
[1:35:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Another thing that makes this mc Paige is the fact that half the time, she just runs up into the enemy's face to hit them

[1:36:07] <$eldritchbee> That note was 100$ a fuckin SCP, like literally
[1:36:08] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat what does paige think of the games protagonist
[1:36:08] <%ElenaManetta> I left stream around the janitor and just got back
[1:36:08] <GUNxSPECTRE> Is this just Better-SCP?
[1:36:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's refreshing to see that Pat is controlling Paige for once LUL
[1:36:14] <%ElenaManetta> Someone quickly explain what the cool mirror smokey effect is, what does it represent
[1:36:18] <%QuadraticGravity> @grim_abel should probably stop assuming what is unlocked from the start based on trailers
[1:36:18] <+Javaa01> All cover is temporary, don't rely on it too much
[1:36:20] <%Sh00s> LITERALLY

[1:44:37] <%PanicSwytch> This is what quantum break should've been
[1:44:43] <OldDarkwraith> They gather round the natal bed, the foolish and the wise. they fear the child yet to be born, whose voice shall rend the skies.
[1:44:52] <zoldknight> Jukebox has the power to get channels banned
[1:45:09] <GUNxSPECTRE> Jukebox drops rap songs with slurs in them
[1:45:13] <%starotter70> The Jukebox grows legs and does a little dance
[1:45:18] <RyuuAoi> @nina96 Shhhhhhhhh... BabyRage :(
[1:45:32] <%arcaderabbit48> So speaking of SCP, anyone here know about the Lobotomy Corporation?
[1:45:43] <Sokumotanaka> The jukebox is a mimic that can kick all of our asses and steal our gf's
[1:45:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Who wants to bet 10 dollarydoos that Her Brother is LITERALLY connected with The Hiss?
[1:45:45] <complicatedclarity> the jukebox plays songs that clap cheeks. violently

[1:46:46] <$jobbedbone> jukebox plays a nostalgic song from your childhood you forgot about, then it is removed from the world forever so you can never hear it again
[1:46:51] <zoldknight> Sadly, the translation ranges from iffy to outright terrible

[1:52:29] <%starotter70> @connos_procrastination aren't we all?
[1:52:30] <@lewdskeletor13> Magneto DID do nothing wrong
[1:52:38] <Funkyfjord> just make your character think about the enemies dying suddenly
[1:52:45] <ScreamLord> So if I write "I am going to inherit a billion dollars from a dead relative I never knew before." Then I'll get a huge check in the mail?
[1:52:48] <Mendin> The only other game I can recall that has a big paracausality plot twist is NEO Scavenger
[1:52:49] <Broand> Regular talk
[1:52:49] <%Kataguro> It sounds like Portal gun shots
[1:52:52] <derekwst3> @lewdskeletor13 i agree
[1:52:55] <ShichiNoBushi> It's the Speed Buster fight.
[1:52:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> This game is the first postmodern game i've seen in awhile that actually is good
[1:52:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Funkyfjord what if you think you are your own enemy for a second
[1:53:05] <Funkyfjord> oh No
[1:53:07] <zeus200045> Pat is actually really tall
[1:53:12] <%chrishnaw> More like Pneumo-causality, amirite?
[1:53:13] <%king_wragles> @Sapphire_Breeze you get cloned I guess?
[1:53:15] <Valdorick> Okay, the clear solution to this entire scenoario, is just to sneak from Warhammer40K figures into the building, and then let the Omnissiah fix it all.
[1:53:15] <zoldknight> Give me that power up you chozo fuck
[1:53:20] <acedeone> @angriestpat Have you seen or read American Gods?

[1:57:51] <%cureneckbeard> ...Psycho Mantis?!
[1:57:52] <+FutaSnek> So... is SCP copyrighted or did they just wanna make their own thing? Why not make a high budget SCP game?

[1:58:21] <DatAsuna> @kindashagg i liked GR2's physics mayhem tho
[1:58:24] <Soul_Intern> DAMN
[1:58:24] <Terrabyte_The_Terrible> Also SCP is open source, anyone can make it and profit off of it
[1:58:25] <+Darastrix> I Get It!
[1:58:27] <%worldbrand> they're pretty nice about creative commons but i imagine they wanted more creative control
[1:58:27] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp

[1:58:33] <DatAsuna> Kat gravbbing like 8 things at once
[1:58:35] <noobpsyboticus> @FutaSnek SCP is not copywrited. They probably didn't use it so they don't have to stick to canon
[1:58:45] <+netrac> I remember SCP being a legal mess
[1:58:47] <%alexandrecau> don'T think scp owns the concept of paranormal collector base
[1:58:50] <%starotter70> I'll be back in a bit

[1:59:05] <%chrishnaw> Pat, where's your Ray-Tracing?
[1:59:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Not kidding: Visuals are SUPER juttery and almost nauseating. It's worse than dropping frames. It's visually harsh to look at. Might want to restart when food comes. (Doesn't seem as bad since you left the tutorial cube world.)
[1:59:06] <%worldbrand> there are some pretty well produced scp shorts on youtube. dollhouse came out not too long ago
[1:59:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> jeez that does damage
[1:59:08] <%alexandrecau> like MIB is pretty much scp in some aspect
[1:59:12] <derekwst3> well random people have made the scp so yes its a legal mess
[1:59:12] <+polaroidjackson> my guess is they just wanted to do their own thing outside of being tethered by scp lore
[1:59:13] <+Curua> That looks so fucking satisfying
[1:59:17] <Broand> SCP canon got real convoluted and jank
[1:59:21] <%demegodz> Lewd

[1:59:37] <televisedrevolting> There is no SCP canon

[2:18:46] <+RogueMinja> Remember to crouch under cover.
[2:18:51] <morningmoondude> I like this remake of Mista vs White Album
[2:18:52] <+Zereaux> why you catchin bullets with your face?
[2:18:53] <+Javaa01> Use cover, he can't throw shit at you through solid concrete walls
[2:18:54] <krymzen5> just don't get hit while hitting him Kappa
[2:18:54] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Cover and shoot
[2:18:56] <Virokwet> does this game have a roll
[2:18:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @DeaconBluesClues sounds like a fun game :)
[2:19:00] <Blurredborderlines> It helps if the thing you're trying to grab is highlighted
[2:19:03] <pandafaustin> Are there any non human enemies in this game?
[2:19:04] <%mankeyfigh> Those LAUNNCHED objects do a bunch of DAMAGE
[2:19:05] <%vaporousTippler> Is this the Advent Rising sequel?
[2:19:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You'll never do it, Pat. Not in a million years. It's impossible.
[2:19:13] <Soul_Intern> OH
[2:19:15] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Does holding an item make a shield for you?
[2:19:16] <CurrySauseBandit> @pandafaustin You'll see.

[2:19:22] <%ElenaManetta> Are you weak, or is he strong
[2:19:22] <faegbeard> yeah you facetank that damage
[2:19:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat stay in cover
[2:19:24] <SleepyMaribo> whats the estimated time before that becomes a normal enemy
[2:19:24] <%Divryne> Pat what's cover?
[2:19:24] <%Estuko> that death screen hurts my eyes :(
[2:19:24] <Soul_Intern> DAAAAAAMN

[2:19:26] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL he fucking used a GENERATOR to slap his shit xD
[2:19:26] <%Divryne> Never heard of it.
[2:19:26] <%GIGA255> looks like he cant dodge while hes lifting 2 objects
[2:19:26] <Valdorick> Facefuck the enemy

[2:19:35] <+FutaSnek> Hopefully there's no penalty of death
[2:19:36] <%WheatlyXT> clempsF
[2:19:39] <jou_star> F
[2:19:39] <+JackMillerTime> if you hold it longer does it give him time to dodge?
[2:19:39] <KasiCrafter> Getting rammed with a concrete block going 70mph HURTS! Who knew!
[2:19:40] <al0nem0nster> now that I think of it, technically shooting a gun is also just throwing something without using your hands.
[2:19:42] <%floralkami> Maybe you have to stun him?
[2:19:42] <%ElenaManetta> Fight him like you would a Dark Souls boss
[2:19:44] <blowntheguy> he big strong tho
[2:19:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zereaux because las plagus is cool

[2:19:57] <RyuuAoi> BabyRage
[2:19:59] <%mankeyfigh> BE A COWARD
[2:20:00] <%WheatlyXT> Pat just hit it and don’t get hit and you’ll win
[2:20:01] <%cureneckbeard> apatBig and STRONG
[2:20:01] <alrobot2014> isn't this what paige said before spending two hours being killed by regular enemies?
[2:20:06] <%floralkami> @angriestpat maybe the gun stuns him?
[2:20:07] <faegbeard> "I am a coward" — Pat Boivin, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019
[2:20:09] <krymzen5> @al0nem0nster bullets are just tiny metal rocket punches
[2:20:11] <complicatedclarity> the strongest ability is cowardice
[2:20:18] <Dr_Mooose> juked
[2:20:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Cowardice is a valid tactic
[2:20:51] <SleepyMaribo> Pat in a nutshell, doesnt do the thing, gets wrecked, is told to do the thing, Pat then goes no, thus continues to suffer when he could do the thing and make his life easier.
[2:20:53] <Broand> can you catch his bullshit
[2:20:59] <%ElenaManetta> Is there a lull in his patterns where he WON'T dodge your throws? I'm not seeing it
[2:21:01] <Dame_90> Rekt
[2:21:01] <%InugamiTheHound> xcalF
[2:21:02] <vexion_smh> damn
[2:21:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Broand apparently not
[2:21:09] <NeroInfinite> You can not catch his bullshit
[2:21:10] <%Divryne> Pat catch the shit he throws at you and throw it back or something.
[2:21:10] <Delenay> can you shoot his attacks when he draws them to him
[2:21:11] <@lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis
[2:21:11] <krymzen5> killing the mobs 1st may help
[2:21:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat and Paige were truly made for each other
[2:21:16] <Kalcom> okay so you can stop his attacks
[2:21:16] <Delenay> deny him ammo
[2:21:17] <zoldknight> I think you just shoot him a lot
[2:21:17] <blowntheguy> yeah you can
[2:21:18] <frozenottsel> Oh, is that Paige, I think I just heard Paige!

[2:52:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> Shit's locked
[2:52:53] <%Cruellatrix> Paige - do you prefer to watch Pat play video games or do you like to play yourself?
[2:52:54] <%ElenaManetta> Does pulling the light switch re-teleport you?
[2:52:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's made too much sense to this point to be Lynchshow.
[2:52:54] <+Zereaux> so do condoms
[2:52:59] <faegbeard> Season 3 of Twin Peaks already exists, it's called Deadly Premonition

[3:04:13] <al0nem0nster> one day, several months if not a year go, the developers of this game told a middle aged man with glasses, to walk into a pitch black room, and smoke with his back to a stagelight.
[3:04:16] <tacoisgoods> This is a better use of 3D Live Action then quantum break
[3:04:17] <Mendin> I think the O7s are The Board
[3:04:17] <Ravingpyro> worth it just to hear Max

[3:04:20] <FirearmsInstructor> Who is this shadow speaker? Is it the former director that shot himself in the beginning? Or someone else?
[3:04:26] <fusedforms> why would you set up your org in a house that can eat you
[3:04:30] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat featuring MAX PAYNE as THE ILLUSIVE MAN
[3:04:36] <+MazDoThing> It's seriously just Max Payne monologues
[3:04:36] <@lewdskeletor13> There’s no such thing as too suspicious!
[3:04:36] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it's the former director
[3:04:41] <%Forente> He sure loves to smoke
[3:04:43] <Blurredborderlines> Dammit Epic why you gotta release good games tho
[3:04:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @Laecerelius Thank you.

[3:04:51] <Mendin> And keeps the creepies in
[3:05:04] <%Estuko> monkaS a TRAITOR
[3:05:05] <JonEWorldbeater> They call him Vamp because he's bisexual
[3:05:08] <%Anonymasque> These people talk like they're at a Poetry Slam.

[3:13:45] <MavMarsh> using scp's to swindle the government lol

[3:14:17] <Mendin> I like how shortcuts are amplified via Noneuclidean Horse Office

[3:14:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> he quested RIP
[3:14:42] <+mrbleeeh> Quest?!
[3:14:46] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> remember the note you found at the beginning saying what words to useand which ones not to use?
[3:14:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is basically just a shittier version of The Speedwagon Foundation as the Joestar family Stand.
[3:14:52] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> yeyeye
[3:14:56] <caol2017> what now
[3:14:58] <%floralkami> @suikudo doesn't seem like something they could stop even if they wanted
[3:14:59] <+AllenDeadman> evil what?
[3:14:59] <%Laecerelius> They're using the words they were told to use!
[3:15:04] <@lewdskeletor13> The letter didn’t mention Alaska, good

[3:15:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> @GeneralSCPatton huh. I guess SWF would be a SCP foundation with its pillar men and stand arrows hidden away
[3:15:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 15m.
[3:15:26] <ShichiNoBushi> I read that as "projectile coke".
[3:15:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh hey, you got the SPC
[3:15:31] <%connos_procrastination> it was an evil scissor
[3:15:42] <al0nem0nster> @Profbathrobe apparently about 3 hours 15 minutes.
[3:15:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @ShichiNoBushi Stop throwing 8-balls D:
[3:15:48] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat the floating people hiss

[3:16:05] <%ElenaManetta> The game took a very quiet turn after that boss fight
[3:16:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Stand Users
[3:16:32] <+vodone> Literally reality benders in SCP
[3:16:37] <+ArcLifth> They got stabbed with an arrowhead
[3:16:39] <+DeaconBluesClues> a throw distance of SIX METERS
[3:16:41] <%nmaten> parautilitarian is a stupid name
[3:16:42] <+bumpngrindhouse_> [REDACTED]
[3:16:43] <fusedforms> just call them espers
[3:16:45] <blackbookalpha> the "bureaucratese" in this game is RIPE
[3:16:45] <%dekkitout> Literally Stands
[3:16:56] <%Nemesis2098> yo is this a secret scp game
[3:17:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Not everything is stands
[3:17:03] <%TaifuDragon> Lmao Darling has tiny dick powers
[3:17:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Paranormal Liberation Front
[3:17:08] <al0nem0nster> @Nemesis2098 basically yes.
[3:17:09] <%ElenaManetta> I appreciate it when people put a funny spin on blacked out text. Instead of saying "blank", going, "BEUGHEGHGE"
[3:17:15] <SulfurousAcid> many things is stands though
[3:17:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Who is that guy?
[3:17:20] <Thalchampz> not even a secret scp game
[3:17:25] <@lewdskeletor13> Uh hello sir?
[3:17:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> My bet bullshit
[3:17:25] <+AllenDeadman> monkaS
[3:17:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Standing across the way?
[3:17:26] <%nmaten> hes the final boss
[3:17:26] <%Laecerelius> I figured he was part of the house
[3:17:26] <+Templar15> bisThink
[3:17:27] <Mendin> Pat look across the balcony
[3:17:27] <zoldknight> Yes
[3:17:28] <transporterthesequel> Janitor is SUPER bullshit
[3:17:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Clearly bullshit
[3:17:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'm guessing Bullshit
[3:17:29] <+vodone> I swear this is just a SCP game
[3:17:30] <caol2017> was he wearing bullshit headphones?
[3:17:32] <blackbookalpha> it usually is
[3:17:33] <$CarlosEoM> hes probably bullshit
[3:17:35] <+chronopaladin> is this a pancakes moment
[3:17:36] <%cureneckbeard> janitor is a stand
[3:17:37] <%spheelman> the janitor was def God
[3:17:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> sup guys
[3:17:38] <FirearmsInstructor> It's simply bullshit
[3:17:39] <KaseKaizer> "fine"
[3:17:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> I'm guessing bullshit. He responded to your thoughts
[3:17:39] <Valdorick> He's litteral god on earth.
[3:17:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @caol2017 no
[3:17:43] <$eldritchbee> he had a radio, not headphones
[3:17:43] <%Forente> Go back and check on him
[3:17:44] <+Curua> Nah, random NPC surely doesn't mean anything
[3:17:44] <%worldbrand> he's named after a mythical figure
[3:17:45] <Teyaric> he is zathras
[3:17:47] <+Despera__> He's God
[3:17:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Apparently that Janitor was played by a famous Finnish actor
[3:17:49] <%dekkitout> Anything can be a Stand, the shoes I'm wearing for example are called 'Walk This Way' Kappa
[3:17:49] <$valriot> @angriestpat He's a JANITOR for a house with infinite space, what do you think?
[3:17:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Maybe he's a similar situation as the gas station attendant at the beginning of Persona 4.
[3:17:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> oh shit, they're just allies lol
[3:17:52] <Ner234> I think the devs outright stated SCP as inspiration
[3:17:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm an idiot
[3:17:56] <+Darastrix> Once again, Janitor/Custodian seems to be a running theme.
[3:17:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The Janitor was Zeus all along
[3:18:03] <Valdorick> Pat, those are normal fucking people
[3:18:12] <fusedforms> is "the janitor did it" the modern "the butler did it"?
[3:18:14] <%ElenaManetta> When the fuck did these people show up
[3:18:23] <%Calek> Any catch the Alan Wake reference?
[3:18:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> When we met Pope, Elena
[3:18:25] <+HellCopter> The Piss
[3:18:30] <%Laecerelius> It's infecting stuff
[3:18:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[3:18:31] <+chronopaladin> the hist?
[3:18:32] <%Dovakhin573> janitor is Morgan freeman therfore god
[3:18:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> kinda
[3:18:38] <%ElenaManetta> I looked away for FIVE MINUTES
[3:18:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> its weird
[3:18:43] <%sirisvirus> house of leafs
[3:18:43] <+Despera__> House of Leaves
[3:18:43] <%worldbrand> It's house of leaves, but house is always printed in blue
[3:18:43] <Badgerconda_> House of leaves, not blue leaves.
[3:18:46] <KaseKaizer> Rose Red?
[3:18:47] <T3merity> I don’t know if they had security cameras like that in the 60s :thinking:
[3:18:48] <$shurtal> bigger on the inside than outside
[3:18:51] <%Laecerelius> I heard about that book. Heard it's really good
[3:18:51] <+SaltyGhostRock> Big Momma's House
[3:18:52] <SulfurousAcid> just House of Leaves
[3:18:54] <+MisterRockett> Oh it's like Monster House!
[3:18:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Awaking Three Leaves?
[3:18:58] <SulfurousAcid> no blue
[3:18:58] <JonEWorldbeater> It's probably because he's secretly a dead god who has been granting people the power to enter the TV world
[3:19:00] <+Despera__> In the book every time HOUSE is written it's in blue
[3:19:03] <derekwst3> hey this is where the spoiler preshow we were watching while waiting for pat
[3:19:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> yeah, house of leaves, its bigger on the inside than the outside and is implied to be totally ancient
[3:19:08] <+mattymcfilth> @angriestpat IM READING THAT RIGHT NOW!
[3:19:13] <%nmaten> its the brown note except you shit your sanity out
[3:19:14] <%Laecerelius> reflections, how do they work?!
[3:19:18] <Badgerconda_> this game is basically if someone put twin peaks, scp, and lost in a blender.
[3:19:23] <%worldbrand> The book is good but it is wrapped in a metanarrative that is kind of tedious
[3:19:24] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat you should upgrade your gun at a control point
[3:19:31] <SulfurousAcid> I need to get House of Leaves
[3:19:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Funfact Paige: When houses foundations settle over time, they can move WAY more than just an inch. :)
[3:19:48] <%worldbrand> But honestly, I read house of leaves when I was 12, so I might have a diffeent opinion about it if i read it again
[3:19:48] <$eldritchbee> @AngriestPat The janitor didnt have headphones, just a radio
[3:19:52] <DaRoosta89> kitty bath time
[3:19:55] <+mattymcfilth> its an awesome book if you like psychological horror
[3:19:56] <%ElenaManetta> LOL
[3:19:59] <metalwater8> Just got in how good is the game so far?
[3:20:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh fuck. Don't tell me this whole thing is an experiment
[3:20:00] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah that's not suspicious

[3:30:39] <Mendin> He did say you'd be working for him/assisting him when you first met him
[3:30:40] <vexion_smh> LUL LUL
[3:30:42] <%bakiinthedemon> He's obviously a vampire Pat
[3:30:43] <%Curua> Elmo's a vampire

[3:30:47] <coyotezappa> the building is a vampire
[3:30:47] <+Wheatabull> The building is a vampire ?
[3:30:48] <%thewordofhelix> that tree is a VAMPIRE
[3:30:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat if he's the building why doesn't he have buzzing red cubes coming out of his ass and earholes
[3:30:50] <Dr_Mooose> I believe Paige

[3:30:51] <Mendin> @AngriestPat See if the hell hallway in the cafeteria is open now?
[3:30:52] <%ClericOfSparda> it's always either vampires or skeletons
[3:30:53] <Valdorick> All Slavs are Vampires; FACTS
[3:30:53] <$renegadehatter> Have you seen him and a reflection in the same place?!?!
[3:30:53] <derekwst3> she has a reflection @AngriestPat not a vampire
[3:30:55] <%Nemesis2098> did Paige schedule the eye doctor appointment?
[3:30:55] <Ner234> That's a G U N
[3:30:55] <GreggyGallz> Imagine Paige's theory turns out to be true.
[3:30:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige the vampire is a pair of sissors
[3:30:56] <+AntithesisEK> vampire trees are a valid concern
[3:30:57] <Ion_Laser> I'M A VAMPIRE!
[3:30:58] <FirearmsInstructor> OK I WANT THAT GUN :D
[3:30:59] <MidnightBurst12> the scissors was a vampire

[3:31:01] <%connos_procrastination> paige is a mustard vampire
[3:31:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> The house heals
[3:31:03] <%Mr_Strut> I don't think the house gives a shit
[3:31:05] <KasiCrafter> She's THE DIRECTOR. She calls the shots.
[3:31:07] <Delenay> there is a lvl 1 behind you in that first room
[3:31:08] <%HeadsHeldHigh> fight piss
[3:31:12] <%Mr_Pylon> He's a vampire like Nicolas Cage
[3:31:13] <$Wafflum> "The house was like this when I found it..."
[3:31:13] <AMaidIndeed> OH NO IT'S SUPERFLY!

[3:31:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nemesis2098 She'll do that tomorrow
[3:31:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @flyingavocadosofdoom really? Didn't he unlock it when he leveled up 4x with healing / damage etc??? What was the thing he unlocked?
[3:31:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elevator
[3:31:26] <%Laecerelius> There was a level 1 door where you got the telekinesis power up
[3:31:29] <$CarlosEoM> thats some evil shit corridor
[3:31:36] <CorazonFeathers> But they aren't alive, they're vampires Kappa
[3:31:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @flyingavocadosofdoom Also thank you. :)
[3:31:46] <%arcaderabbit48> "So I've been grinding ONscreen"
[3:31:49] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @firearmsinstructor He unlocked a second weapon
[3:31:49] <Valdorick> They're vampire Thralls, Paige @AngriestPat
[3:31:52] <%spheelman> @AngriestPat when you met the janitor he said you were applying for the janitors assiatant position. If he is the buliding it would make sense that you are the new director
[3:31:56] <SpaceGuntank> Catch the rocket!!
[3:32:00] <%aishman> Holy shit the visuals in this game are fucking GREAT
[3:32:04] <%Mr_Strut> Who gave these idiots rockets?

[3:32:06] <%thewordofhelix> @AngriestPat catch the rockets and throw them back!
[3:32:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet you can catch that rocket
[3:32:09] <Mendin> Feel Boss
[3:32:10] <transporterthesequel> Is no one gonna comment on her taking ROCKETS TO THE FACE AND LIVING
[3:32:15] <%starotter70> Of course you are, you're a vampire
[3:32:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @flyingavocadosofdoom damn I misunderstood that. Thank you for clarifying.
[3:32:17] <+KnightOfHopeX> Why can she just take a rocket to the face and not fall down?
[3:32:18] <Ner234> @connos_procrastination Boooo

[3:32:48] <%starotter70> Nice
[3:32:50] <caol2017> 3
[3:32:50] <%Laecerelius> Worth trying
[3:32:50] <%bakiinthedemon> Crazy how Dracula taught the vampires to use rpgs
[3:32:52] <%Bad1uck> Catching requires an upgrade
[3:32:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> that must be an upgrade
[3:32:55] <KaseKaizer> Jebaited
[3:32:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Not enough room
[3:33:01] <%Nobrev> thats lame :(
[3:33:03] <%Bad1uck> Same as throwing grenades back
[3:33:03] <JonEWorldbeater> IT'S NO USE
[3:33:14] <$renegadehatter> Pat secret pickup in that plant alcove beside the stairs
[3:33:22] <%starotter70> TAKE THIS

[3:33:39] <%Laecerelius> Yeah his bullets regen
[3:33:41] <flyingavocadosofdoom> @angriestpat you can upgrade to throw rockets
[3:33:45] <%aishman> You competed one of the quests!
[3:33:53] <%GIGA255> mind bullets
[3:33:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SulfurousAcid yeah you regen amo over time
[3:34:02] <Dr_Mooose> so maybe?
[3:34:03] <%ElenaManetta> Oh that gun is fucking weird
[3:34:08] <FirearmsInstructor> I AM SO ERECT FROM THIS FIREARM
[3:34:09] <%Mr_Strut> It's mass effect rules
[3:34:09] <%ElenaManetta> That was a freaky animation
[3:34:09] <%d00msdaydan> coooool
[3:34:11] <%Laecerelius> The concept of gun fills with the concept of bullets
[3:34:11] <%dekkitout> Gun-kun needs no ammo
[3:34:13] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat it is the concept of GUN
[3:34:16] <%logoth_> Deus Ex Gun
[3:34:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SO FUCKING COOL\
[3:34:18] <%Shadowthedigger> Oh so it's just the dead space gun
[3:34:19] <coyotezappa> It's a VAMPIRE GUN
[3:34:20] <$renegadehatter> I just don't want you to miss the plant alcove personal mod

[3:34:21] <%connos_procrastination> Thats how my dick works
[3:34:22] <%starotter70> The way she spun it was awesome
[3:34:25] <+AntithesisEK> reconceptualizing BULLET please hold
[3:34:25] <+ArcLifth> vampire gun
[3:34:25] <%aishman> Pat don't forget to get your reward and new quests since you finish the HEADSHOT one
[3:34:26] <+KnightOfHopeX> The problem with shooters when you know how guns work is that you know how fast a normal person would get ripped apart. Kinda ruins the immersion.
[3:34:26] <%Shadowthedigger> It's just the arc welder.
[3:34:27] <fusedforms> door?
[3:34:27] <waifoong98> THE CUBES
[3:34:28] <Valdorick> Vampire Gun!
[3:34:29] <MavMarsh> it might also be excalibur
[3:34:29] <%Nobrev> KYOOBZ
[3:34:30] <+GingerStrawhat> I like that the actual gun part is just the grip and the cubes make new guns
[3:34:32] <+fromnibelheim> just got here not too long ago, what's with the people just floating and talking?
[3:34:32] <%ElenaManetta> It's a lego gun
[3:34:33] <+Demerson13> When did Claire Redfield get all these powers?
[3:34:35] <%Forente> It is powered by her mind
[3:34:35] <%torontototoro> hmmm so this is basically the new Prey + Mass Effect in the MIB building
[3:34:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game looks like more fun than I thought it would be when I thought it was shitty.
[3:34:38] <%starotter70> BLEH
[3:34:40] <Ner234> Everything's a Vampire PAT
[3:34:42] <%connos_procrastination> LUL
[3:34:42] <+Ryuutennou> Control is an anagram for vampire
[3:34:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> VAMPIRE GUN
[3:34:42] <+GingerStrawhat> Can you make another gun now?
[3:34:43] <%cureneckbeard> the gun is made of minecraft
[3:34:43] <+mrbleeeh> VAMPIRE GUN
[3:34:45] <$Rumbutt> I mean, from how it's described, it's not even the concept of a gun, it's the concept of a weapon
[3:34:45] <%ClericOfSparda> Vampire gun!
[3:34:46] <%reonome> THE PAT CUBE
[3:34:46] <Ion_Laser> Come now. A vampire gun would shoot stakes!
[3:34:47] <+KnightOfHopeX> Shut up Pat it's a vampire gun.
[3:34:47] <+mattymcfilth> how very philosophical this game is
[3:34:47] <+CharredChord> Vampire Car
[3:34:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> WHAT IS A GUN
[3:34:48] <Valdorick> Its vampires all the way down!
[3:34:49] <$Wafflum> The gun shoots vampires
[3:34:49] <KaseKaizer> VAMPIRE GUN PogChamp
[3:34:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> vampire stream...
[3:34:50] <madskull456> the gun was the evil toaster all along
[3:34:50] <Blurredborderlines> 200% vampire gun
[3:34:52] <%Scottigecko> sounds exactly like something someone with a vampire gun would say
[3:34:52] <%Laecerelius> Paige infected chat with the concept of vampire bullshit
[3:34:52] <%ClericOfSparda> It's spooky!
[3:34:53] <%bakiinthedemon> No the gun just shoots silver bullets to defeat the vampires
[3:34:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> BUT A MISERABLE PILE OF SECRETS
[3:34:56] <+KnightOfHopeX> Vampire Chat
[3:34:57] <%seraphimjordan> is that the biological motherboard on the gun
[3:34:58] <+GalacticaPhanto> apparently it has a gatling gun mode
[3:34:58] <Mendin> Grind quests on your own time Pat
[3:35:00] <blackbookalpha> This area does look like the final stage of Blade 2
[3:35:01] <transporterthesequel> Please upgrade the Vampire Gun Pat
[3:35:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> A vampire gun would be weak to stakes
[3:35:03] <+mrbleeeh> WHAT IS A GUN?
[3:35:04] <%dekkitout> If we believe enough of the vampires, the vampires will become true
[3:35:07] <JonEWorldbeater> Watch everything be a vampire.
[3:35:07] <%aishman> Why does ability say 1?
[3:35:07] <$Wafflum> bullets made of vampires
[3:35:09] <%Laecerelius> Paige is the Hiss
[3:35:09] <Ion_Laser> A vampire gun would shoot holy water like in The Lost Boys
[3:35:10] <+KnightOfHopeX> I vant too succ your guuuuun
[3:35:12] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat Is paige a vampire? she acts like she's getting low on blood every night
[3:35:12] <%aishman> Next to it?
[3:35:13] <coyotezappa> it shoots tiny vampires
[3:35:13] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat That's why the bullets reload, they use your blood!
[3:35:13] <transporterthesequel> The House knows about gun
[3:35:17] <Mendin> 1 ability point leftover, @aishman
[3:35:20] <blackbookalpha> everything is red, like vampire
[3:35:23] <+Ryuutennou> @aishman he has an ability point for skill upgrades
[3:35:28] <%aishman> Oooh okay
[3:35:29] <MidnightBurst12> Is the Hiss a vampire?
[3:35:29] <Blurredborderlines> It knows about the concept, anyways
[3:35:34] <KaseKaizer> ??
[3:35:37] <Clyderso> Gout monkaS
[3:35:37] <%Emperor_Machinus> ??
[3:35:38] <%ElenaManetta> That sounded like you were about to throw up on stream
[3:35:40] <+mrbleeeh> ???
[3:35:40] <%TDotGoat> Vampires do hiss...
[3:35:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> That was a sneeze
[3:35:46] <%Koosahmii> Bless you
[3:35:48] <%reonome> MonkaS
[3:35:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ryuutennou everything costs 2 or more so he can't use it
[3:35:48] <+mrbleeeh> pat is vampire confirmed
[3:35:51] <%reonome> monkaS
[3:35:52] <$Dotta5> did you hear that? he said burlap
[3:35:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Vampires hiss and take people over..
[3:35:54] <+Chronobot> Pony
[3:35:55] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think that said "Pony"
[3:35:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Shame his ass looks so evil'
[3:35:57] <%ElenaManetta> "walkman" you're so old
[3:35:57] <%Emperor_Machinus> true evil
[3:35:58] <CherrieVelvet> did that say pony
[3:35:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are the three triangles beside "deconstruct"? Upgrade points? Can you reallocate them to different things?
[3:35:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> But it sounded like you had an aneurysm
[3:35:59] <%InugamiTheHound> just like in the phantom pain
[3:36:00] <Valdorick> The Vampire gun has no heart to pierced by a wooden stake, so its only weakness is taking it over running water, without the impurities of the earth its metal was forged in, so as to prevent it from shooting.
[3:36:00] <%Laecerelius> No! It's a Somy Talkman!
[3:36:01] <$eldritchbee> oh i guess he does have headphones
[3:36:01] <@lewdskeletor13> HES A VAMPIRE
[3:36:03] <T3merity> A friendly face...concealing TWO FANGS!

[4:14:58] <%juxtest> Im coming around to the idea that the Hiss might be bad
[4:15:00] <%floralkami> "Why do I hear fight music?"
[4:15:01] <+DeaconBluesClues> A AAA
[4:15:02] <%dekkitout> I bet these enemy designs came from a bug that looked spoopy as shift
[4:15:03] <Mendin> @AncelDeLambert It's on PS4 and XBone too
[4:15:06] <+Gravity_Gunner> Simple question - does this game have female enemies?
[4:15:09] <SulfurousAcid> Jesus Joel
[4:15:12] <%Mr_Strut> I like that the hiss acts as a smokescreen
[4:15:15] <%AllyBeeBoo> eww they're so creepy
[4:15:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> are they endless?
[4:15:23] <%waltzqueen> JeSuS JoEl
[4:15:23] <Zael913> I honestly feel like watching this game will cause me to go insane. This entire game is an Eldritch horror/SCP
[4:15:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Are they coming from an enemy generator or something?
[4:15:26] <caol2017> that diagram is cursed
[4:15:27] <GUNxSPECTRE> I do like how you can switch between guns, and not like a simple upgrade
[4:15:30] <Marpolo13> they are shaped like A's

[4:16:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @waifoong98 Player character said it. Then everyone else ran with it. Some retroactive shit going on
[4:16:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why does that diagram look like he's trying to perform autofellatio or something? D:
[4:16:22] <+Gravity_Gunner> @piemen99 No messing about, I was just asking a simple question
[4:16:26] <Fear_Ranjer> uwu
[4:16:29] <ammobasket> They're adapting to the armor?
[4:16:30] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Do you think the enemies in this game defecate?
