[0:18:56] <%Bt_Robot> It was part of the Pre Civil - War compromise. It was only allowed to enter the union if it found another state to join.
[0:18:57] <Derpicus> NB represent
[0:18:58] <AMajorTom> The Arch, tho
[0:19:01] <%StaceMcGate> it dates back to the the debate over slave states Pat, when Kansas and Missouri were admitted tothe US

[0:43:44] <AMajorTom> Don’t pick a spice rack. Pick a design theme for the kitchen. Then all Paige has to do is pick a spice rack that matches that theme.

[0:47:37] <doodledumps> The real hope is to see how many subclasses they include. Especially with Tasha's Cauldron coming out in a month
[0:47:38] <ergulor> 1/4 of magic doesn't sound bad
[0:47:39] <+PlatinumAvacyn> bards are also full casters
[0:47:39] <SolidusA> Women and children too
[0:47:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> Gib Artificer!
[0:47:41] <%Jekado> wizards are learned casters
[0:47:42] <LoneFonte> Warlocks have the patrons
[0:47:42] <+leviting> bard is a full caster in 5e also
[0:47:42] <Djinnazz> Magic, Dark Magic
[0:47:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Warlocks make deals with the devil
[0:47:43] <%king_wragles> wild magic bad
[0:47:45] <NimbusArchon> Book casting, innate casting, pact casting
[0:47:46] <Noveus> sorc have meta magic, warlock don't have that many spells but get usage back on short rest and wizards have access to an entire book worth.
[0:47:46] <%Taisuru> No, Warlocks are the Clerics of Wizards
[0:47:46] <Explodincatz> seems redundant
[0:47:49] <+stantashev> aaay just in time
[0:47:50] <leinadtonu> This overlay thingy is coo, i can see Pat's characters.
[0:47:50] <+unclekulikov> Warlocks have a Patreon
[0:47:52] <%BinaryFireball> plumbers are missing
[0:47:55] <@SSaryn> Paladin and Warlocks are the big asks right now
[0:47:56] <jorniev> my favorite are cleric wizard and rougue
[0:47:57] <BedHome> Warlocks get spells back on short rests. Wizards need to learn spells and have a spellbook, sourcerers just create spells outa thin air.
[0:47:57] <capnjazz22> warlocks sell their soul for a d10 cantrip
[0:47:59] <%BinaryFireball> no plumber class
[0:47:59] <+ActiveLink> 5E Warlocks are weird
[0:48:00] <+REDtheBEAST> oh god no! not wild magic
[0:48:00] <%Spydurman> Warlocks have Patrons while Sorcerers are Wild magic
[0:48:00] <%Calek> there's like 5 full casters in 5e
[0:48:01] <%Broand> Warlock is like cleric/wizard hybrid but with cthulu instead of the holy spirit
[0:48:02] <%Agami23> warlocks are old god worshippers, sorcerers get their magic from their family blood, wizards worked hard to learn magic
[0:48:02] <BedHome> Yeah. Warlock have a patron
[0:48:03] <@commanderclaw> Sorcerers can manipulate their magic to do shit like casting a spell as a bonus action
[0:48:03] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Oh god wild magic
[0:48:04] <UndeadManatee> artificer plz
[0:48:07] <$raxes8> Warlocks get magic from a pact with an entity. Sorcs get magic from a bloodline Wizards learn their shit from books.
[0:48:07] <%aslfrasle> @PatStaresAt Wizard: Learning Magic, Sorcerer: Born with Magic, Warlock: Magic Sugar Daddy
[0:48:10] <Coystick> Warlocks get their power from others, Sorcerers inherit their power, Wizards research their power
[0:48:15] <+Sarevic> Warlocks get very few spells but their spells level up, wizards are regular casting boys
[0:48:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Anybody else think it's hilarious that "Patron" is a Warlock?
[0:48:17] <%MisterRockett> Wild Magic?
[0:48:18] <BedHome> ALSO THERE WILL BE SUBCLASSES
[0:48:19] <%BinaryFireball> paladins are boring
[0:48:19] <doodledumps> Everyone wants that sweet SMITE
[0:48:19] <+lethallylactic> And no Barbarian? That's a crime
[0:48:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Who would want to be a Paladin? They suck
[0:48:21] <%blitzrush1200> Monk would be cool
[0:48:21] <$raxes8> They all play very differently.
[0:48:21] <MartiusGW> whats a paladin?
[0:48:26] <%Pappajimbo> wizards have spell books sorceras can cast more spells but are limited on what spells they can have
[0:48:27] <@commanderclaw> PLD is gonna be a good character, so they did the evil ones first
[0:48:29] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> its still early access still right?
[0:48:32] <BedHome> EACH CLASS WILL HAVE 3 SUBCLASSES PROBABLY
[0:48:34] <%Order_of_Mystery> and paladins aren't forced to be lawful good in 5e!
[0:48:36] <%PaladinDupre> Thanks Pat
[0:48:36] <%VashyronM> paladin/warlock is a busted multiclass.
[0:48:40] <jorniev> whats a paldin!?
[0:48:41] <NimbusArchon> 5e paladin subclasses are fantastic
[0:48:46] <%DakotaMacDoodle> probably want people to pick stuff they don't usually pick
[0:48:59] <krazedkarl> Casters are always OP in DnD
[0:49:00] <doodledumps> Paladin is a holy warrior. Like Chad Thundercock for GOD
[0:49:02] <stabbityrabbit> Especially since 5e Paladins are actually my favorite class ever. The shift over to PoE Paladins is great.
[0:49:04] <KiryujiKazamoto> i just put too much salt in my rice
[0:49:05] <JaceDarkstar> warlocks also get there spells back quicker than any other
[0:49:06] <%PaladinDupre> WHY IS HIGHLIGHT MY MESSAGE SO EXPENSIVE NOW
[0:49:06] <%Calek> do a fight, long rest, do a fight
[0:49:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> Make the Sword Bigger
[0:49:13] <%Bt_Robot> High level monks are basically just Dragonball Z characters.
[0:49:14] <BlkFlameKami> the compromise is if you rest too much your companions will leave
[0:49:16] <digaogrunge> q
[0:49:19] <+REDtheBEAST> Wild magic=Russian roulette
[0:49:21] <%Aztec50> Welcome to D&D rests!
[0:49:23] <%cureneckbeard> The five-minute adventuring day has been a thing since at least as far back as D&D 3rd edition
[0:49:24] <BedHome> resting should break some quests. it needs to be ballanced like that, with on screen timers
[0:49:25] <@commanderclaw> They need a "Percent of brain eaten" meter
[0:49:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Isn't being a warlock named Patron kinda like being a musician named Piano?
[0:49:27] <%VashyronM> it was that way in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2
[0:49:27] <+dmtjinni> INJECT PAT TO MY BRAIN.exe
[0:49:28] <LoneFonte> huh??
[0:49:29] <lord_sykos> Original Sin 2 had the bedroll system where you could top off between every right
[0:49:33] <%Ynkubus_> What?
[0:49:34] <%afronooch> @paladindupre pat told us to stop, so we of course over did it
[0:49:37] <+artschooltrash> That's honestly just a flaw in 5e. Without any story incentive, it's pretty busted
[0:49:38] <%cureneckbeard> earlier D&D had wandering monsters to stop you just full-resting
[0:49:40] <G03933> nap time
[0:49:46] <%BinaryFireball> they might
[0:49:49] <BlindGato> How about rest ambushes like Darkest Dungeon?
[0:49:49] <Noveus> You know there will be a workshop fix to whatever "fix" they do for this tho and everyone will install it LUL
[0:49:49] <%depressed_skeleton> brain go dum
[0:49:51] <dinnydanny777> Just like real life
[0:49:51] <%Pappajimbo> or have athe monsters gang up on you as you sleep
[0:49:58] <%Profmcstevie> Too much rest, brain ghosts
[0:49:58] <%BinaryFireball> it might just not be implemented yet
[0:50:00] <%cureneckbeard> when I run 5e I usually have some time incentive like you have a week to do this quest
[0:50:00] <koffeemancer> fuck i kinda want to multi class a paladin with a pact of the blade warlock now
[0:50:00] <Djinnazz> That would have to be an internal clock, otherwise you can't turn the game off.
[0:50:00] <%Piemen99> Wizards learned magic normally Sorcerers their dad fucked a dragon Warlocks have sugar daddies giving them a allowance
[0:50:05] <Daxalog> Then everyone panics and dosnt play Wizard
[0:50:07] <BedHome> yeah 5e is balanced around quests not letting you rest after every fight without being horribly ambushed
[0:50:07] <doodledumps> I mean short rests take anywhere from 1-7 hours so the drawback is losing time in the world
[0:50:13] <KiryujiKazamoto> Majora's Mask that shit
[0:50:14] <+yukichocomilk> the DM handles that in a normal d&d game
[0:50:14] <Enemy_In_Disguise> “Timer to Mind Flayer”
[0:50:16] <%PaladinDupre> @afronooch well i can afford 1...
[0:50:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If the whole game is trying to purify yourself im gonna be pissed
[0:50:23] <doodledumps> A long rest is 8+ hours which is like a full night's sleep
[0:50:28] <%BoxNavy> dont like that voice
[0:50:30] <BedHome> the game needs to model that drawback in story terms
[0:50:33] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait chat when did highlight my message become 20k

[0:51:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Paige reppin Bards
[0:51:50] <Ethel9727> Imo they should add difficulty based timers to stuff. So like if you long rest X amount of times a quest will fail or other bad stuff will happen. Then it can be more lenient on the easier difficulties, and you can easily have the quest say "This will fail in X days."

[1:04:13] <ikantreeed> Ball juice the grounds

[1:05:06] <Pt_Kamen> this isn't Genshin Impact?
[1:05:10] <%chiazam> SCHOOLS
[1:05:12] <Xelgus> SCROLL DOWN
[1:05:16] <%aslfrasle> You can give him a subclass
[1:05:17] <PirateMike_> Gale is the best how dare you chat
[1:05:19] <SerRule1> Stick with evocation
[1:05:20] <BedHome> YOU PICK YOUR SUBCLASS ONCE THEN CANT CHANGE IT
[1:05:21] <leinadtonu> How do you rest in this game?
[1:05:22] <%chiazam> @Pt_Kamen GI was yesterday
[1:05:22] <%Wallabri> 8 HP.... ahhhhh wizards......
[1:05:24] <$RealThiele> genshin impact + RTX ON
[1:05:25] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:05:26] <Kravus> At lvl 2 you choose your wizard subclass, yeah
[1:05:31] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt you cant change your subclass later
[1:05:32] <%Ne1son> Wizards get their Scholl at 2nd level
[1:05:35] <%RyTYoung> S M R T
[1:05:38] <jpereta> Wizards have like 14 subclases in 5e
[1:05:39] <+Memitim> I can't wait for the twitch integration to show quest log.
[1:05:42] <%chiazam> He wants Evocation
[1:05:43] <%mikessdd> Yeah every class has subclasses you can choose eventually
[1:05:49] <$RealThiele> sickness
[1:05:53] <+AgniBrandt> Evocation is REALLY GOOD
[1:05:56] <SerRule1> evocation realllllly beefs up magic missle later on
[1:05:56] <SomeAsianDood> so dafuq does this extension do
[1:05:56] <%thelaxinator> I doubt featherfall is as useful here as it is in tabletop
[1:05:59] <%machshop> spanish enemies?
[1:06:03] <+AgniBrandt> Evocation can negate friendly fire for AOE!
[1:06:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Crowd Control
[1:06:05] <marvel877> Why is Pat's character dressed in Cloud's dress in FF7?
[1:06:06] <LoneFonte> so damage vs support?
[1:06:06] <Macfine> Evocation = pewpew mage
[1:06:07] <+Rakenshin> Evocation is for blasting fools
[1:06:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Elemental or crowd control basically
[1:06:09] <%aslfrasle> @PatStaresAt Damage Wizard or Support Wizard
[1:06:09] <KiryujiKazamoto> cobbee go frrrrr
[1:06:09] <QuipSan> spells are the same for both
[1:06:09] <+Tommy_Armitage> evo probably had fireball
[1:06:11] <Big_Dream> what class
[1:06:13] <SomeAsianDood> The description wasn't exactly forthcoming
[1:06:13] <NimbusArchon> Abjuration has dispels
[1:06:16] <+Ragnakawaii> Evocation so you can fireball even better
[1:06:17] <doodledumps> Evocations are BOOM battle magic. Abjuration is more protection and shield
[1:06:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> Evocation. Feather fall is amazing, and WILL save your ass on many occassions
[1:06:21] <0rond> @PatStaresAt grease isn't particularly flammable in the current iteration of dnd, if the game is accurate it won't work with fire
[1:06:21] <%BoxNavy> brrrrr incoming?
[1:06:22] <+AgniBrandt> Evocation negates friendly fire for all AOE spells
[1:06:23] <%rdark_ksu> brrrrrrr
[1:06:24] <TheDiddlerz> hover over the subclass features
[1:06:24] <Big_Dream> divination is really powerful
[1:06:26] <$RealThiele> Conjuration create your own plant matter Kappa

[1:06:37] <+Rakenshin> MORE nukes
[1:06:40] <HarmlessCrow> Damage wizard or SHIELD WIZARD
[1:06:42] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt subclass is what they are MINMAXED for, they can still do other shit
[1:06:46] <%SirKeigan> Warlock? How about More lock!
[1:06:50] <QuipSan> you can pickl your new spells

[1:08:48] <stealthfart> It’s a bit of a disappointment that Pat didn’t show all of his FFXIV 5.3 on stream. I just finished MSQ and wanted to see his reaction
[1:08:52] <+Memitim> @AllCingCrazyViolentSamuri To a horse? No thanks.
[1:08:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Shady doesn't look like she does in the loading screen. Weird
[1:09:10] <$RealThiele> @stealthfart vods should have it
[1:09:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> If the spell casters look like this, what's the Barbarians gonna be like

Doing the long rest too frequently can be detrimental. you can miss out on big "timed" events like participating in a castle defense for a major faction and loosing favor with a companion.

[1:11:49] <+trigglypuf> Please stop having sex with my brain sir

[1:11:55] <%blitzrush1200> Nah wizard is mostly good
[1:11:55] <henrydrunkenlyplays117> when did pat start stream
[1:11:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like that about this party
[1:11:56] <+NitronStreams> This guys SUS as fuck toss him out the airlock
[1:11:57] <+professormorrigan> wyll doesnt seem evil
[1:11:57] <$Aitch971> cause good sucks
[1:12:05] <Sypheck> They don't like Pat? This game is more realistic than I thought. Kappa
[1:12:08] <fierysnowflakes> A Rouge, Cleric, Warlock, and a Wizard/Sorcerer. This sounds like a bard joke LUL
[1:12:09] <TheDiddlerz> [Crazy Talk]
[1:12:10] <stealthfart> You go into people’s minds
[1:12:11] <lightninglord> Gale is absolutely Good
[1:12:11] <wibbwobbler> wow
[1:12:15] <Xeno351> kill them all peter
[1:12:15] <Picia000123> I am guilty
[1:12:16] <HarmlessCrow> Gale and Wyll are pretty neutral but I wouldn't callt hem "good"
[1:12:17] <%trustycoyote> that's actually really smart
[1:12:19] <$joylent_blue> that's.... really interesting actually
[1:12:21] <+storebrandcandy> evil will always win because good is dumb
[1:12:23] <leinadtonu> party members ain't nice
[1:12:24] <%ClericOfSparda> Are you a "Good" Character?
[1:12:25] <%blitzrush1200> Yeah cause bad options are like kill everyone
[1:12:28] <theanora1> Oh man Pat, did you see BLU can now hit 70?
[1:12:31] <%chiazam> BUT ITS DAY
[1:12:31] <+xiccy> Wyl and Gale are both good
[1:12:33] <%Calek> honestly Astarion, Lae'Zel and Shadowheart are gonna be my go to everytime, they're neat
[1:12:33] <%thelaxinator> did he get a graphical update since last week? he looks different
[1:12:34] <0rond> I mean he is out there in broad daylight
[1:12:36] <$RealThiele> neutral only
[1:12:36] <%SilverKryscent> PAT HE'S IN THE SUN
[1:12:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! How you doing Pat? I am almost done with the 5.3 patch, and way more comfortable with my tanking and healing. Hyped to explore new content with everyone else
[1:12:39] <%depressed_skeleton> vampire in the sun? lies
[1:12:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Patron is Chaotic Neutral, I think
[1:12:42] <+Memitim> @PatStaresAt It's also because they want people to go Full Evil for Early Access because it's the least common in their games.
[1:12:44] <+lethallylactic> He can't be a vampire because it's daytime Kappa
[1:12:50] <Coystick> Make the Neutrals the "Good" ones and cut the "Good" ones entirely to make the game nice and gritty on release
[1:12:55] <Torgue_1> @ClericOfSparda Depends on how you play
[1:12:56] <jpereta> a Vampire spawn, a true vampire would murder you superhard
[1:13:01] <+Vigonept> he cant be daytime since its vampire time
[1:13:02] <+NitronStreams> honestly, parties that dont get along immediately are way more interesting
[1:13:06] <leinadtonu> wyll also died before joining my party :(
[1:13:07] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt profficiency is a bonus to wielding it. you dont have to be profficient to wield it
[1:13:10] <QuipSan> handaxe is strength
[1:13:13] <%thelaxinator> he's like... half vampire, and I think they can walk in the sun if they've fed recently
[1:13:17] <+turnipkupo> I want to kill them all
[1:13:23] <henrydrunkenlyplays117> pat stream time?
[1:13:24] <+Memitim> Handaxe is strength
[1:13:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @NitronStreams Absolutely. More banter that way
[1:13:28] <%ClericOfSparda> @Torgue_1 I get that, I mean is Pat's character of a good alignment
[1:13:38] <+Ragnakawaii> it uses strength mod
[1:13:40] <%chiazam> Scales off Strength
[1:13:43] <+Cyamos> strength for damage instead of dex
[1:13:43] <%cureneckbeard> str weapon rather than dex
[1:13:45] <$zyberion626> atk rolls use your STR mod
[1:13:46] <HarmlessCrow> Feed Astarion garlic to make him grow big and strong
[1:13:47] <lightninglord> It does.
[1:13:47] <$Aitch971> finesse allows dex mod
[1:13:47] <prime_name> Finesse weapons use Dex
[1:13:48] <Goodvibes99508> offhand attack will he bonus action but cast and a5tack areb9th attack
[1:13:51] <lightninglord> Dagger is "Finesse"
[1:13:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pats getting fitted like every Rogue/Fighter multiclass
[1:13:52] <$RealThiele> does dual wielding not work with spells?
[1:13:54] <broostmonkey> daggers are finesse
[1:13:54] <%Nekros4442> Anything that doesnt have Finesse uses strength
[1:13:55] <Habblewater> scales with strength and you're a skinny lad
[1:13:55] <%Order_of_Mystery> stick with daggers for throwing
[1:13:55] <lord_sykos> Unless a weapon has the finesse property, you use strength for it
[1:13:58] <Xelgus> all attacks do, unless it says finesse
[1:13:59] <0rond> @PatStaresAt everything is STR unless it's finesse that can use both
[1:14:00] <+Memitim> Dagger says "Finesse"
[1:14:01] <broostmonkey> look for finesse on weapons
[1:14:01] <%Turtle_Senpai> finesse is the only thing that uses dex
[1:14:04] <+xiccy> unless the weapon is light it uses strength
[1:14:05] <$Afterman_> you didnt equip an offhand
[1:14:06] <$Aitch971> if it doesn't have finesse it aint dex
[1:14:07] <+shabop> All melee weapons use strength unless they are finesse
[1:14:10] <QuipSan> finesse weapons use dex
[1:14:10] <%shurtal> you only have one dagger equipeed
[1:14:10] <%Ne1son> If a weapon does not have the Finesse Tag it uses strength.
[1:14:11] <TheDiddlerz> I need a suffer emote
[1:14:11] <SomeAsianDood> you don't have one equipped
[1:14:13] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt finesse means you choose strength or dex, some weapons are each
[1:14:14] <lightninglord> All weapons are Strength by default. Dex is used for Finesse weapons, so that's the thing you're looking for.
[1:14:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> you took your other knife off
[1:14:15] <Daxalog> You didnt equip an off hand
[1:14:17] <$Afterman_> you only have 1 weapon equipped
[1:14:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Uh Pat, your STR is shit
[1:14:21] <+stantashev> unequiped
[1:14:22] <Gieron667> blind
[1:14:23] <%Bt_Robot> EQUIP OFFHAND
[1:14:25] <%Pappajimbo> daggers and raipers are finess weapons they use your better dex modifier
[1:14:26] <%Smeagleman6> Anything that is labeled "Finesse" uses whichever is higher between STR and DEX
[1:14:29] <0rond> @PatStaresAt everything is STR unless it's finesse that can use both
[1:14:30] <$RealThiele> dagger uses dex
[1:14:34] <broostmonkey> @patstaresat look for Finesse under weapons to use dex
[1:14:38] <BedHome> take your time
[1:14:39] <Xelgus> abilities on K
[1:14:39] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt all melees are STR unless they say Finesse, or your a hexblade
[1:14:40] <%Smeagleman6> Any other melee weapons use STR by default
[1:14:47] <Aydarkzero> is Pat using a magic build?
[1:14:59] <BedHome> oblivion elf voice: "thats some gunk ass goo, man"
[1:15:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Would a GUN be a str weapon? I wouldn't think so
[1:15:02] <%Movemeister> it's ruddy mysterious
[1:15:06] <%thelaxinator> wow that looks like Fort Joy
[1:15:10] <%cureneckbeard> Party cliff~
[1:15:17] <$RealThiele> he does have magic, somatic components must not exist
[1:15:19] <wibbwobbler> this game is so sicc
[1:15:19] <0rond> ranged weapons use dex I think
[1:15:22] <BedHome> @GarbageQueenEllie ranged weapons are dex only, other than a few
[1:15:24] <0rond> so a gun would be dex
[1:15:24] <+turnipkupo> Pat has fought mudcrabs more fearsome than them
[1:15:27] <%Nekros4442> All ranged weapons use dex
[1:15:29] <BedHome> thrown weapons are str
[1:15:31] <+NitronStreams> KILL THEM
[1:15:32] <BedHome> ranged non thrown are dex
[1:15:35] <%Faustgesicht> Any suggestions for someone having difficulty with controls? Not buggy, just not used to them
[1:15:41] <Ner234> @GarbageQueenEllie Of course. just squeeze the trigger harder.
[1:15:43] <BedHome> wait thrown may be either, i forget
[1:15:45] <BedHome> JERMA
[1:15:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @BedHome Makes sense. Blasters in KOTOR worked that way, I think
[1:15:48] <deecomposer> dont think it dont say it
[1:15:48] <+turnipkupo> AYE, AGREED, KILL THEM
[1:15:49] <BedHome> THATS FUCKING JERMA
[1:15:50] <Aydarkzero> everyone can use Gun but if your stats are high enough you get access to better moves
[1:15:50] <Ipsenscastle> urgh
[1:15:54] <%RyTYoung> REX?
[1:15:58] <+lethallylactic> Jerma?!
[1:15:59] <%machshop> it's tiny Dax Shepard
[1:16:01] <Habblewater> STOOOHP
[1:16:03] <%thelaxinator> halfling heads are so huge, it's scary

[1:16:47] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Mouse over the skill to see how big your bonus is for the check
[1:16:48] <SocialMisfitGamer> Fucking idiot
[1:16:49] <%chiazam> NICE
[1:16:49] <0rond> -everyone likes that=
[1:16:51] <+gustavozxd> that was incredibly easy LUL
[1:16:51] <%Madbearv> why's jerma in the game
[1:16:52] <%Bt_Robot> YOU MIGHT CATCH THE VAPOURS
[1:16:54] <+Rakenshin> Short people are easy to trick
[1:16:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Shady went SPLOOSH
[1:17:01] <$RealThiele> those animations LUL
[1:17:01] <+professormorrigan> true
[1:17:05] <Gribbin2> You'd get 40 xp
[1:17:05] <lionsignal> ye
[1:17:06] <$Afterman_> yes give us convo exp pls
[1:17:07] <QuipSan> yep
[1:17:08] <+professormorrigan> 100%
[1:17:09] <+Memitim> that's how it is in dnd though
[1:17:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> Welcome too DND
[1:17:15] <%Calek> most of your exp is gonna come from quests
[1:17:15] <%TheLemuroid> I like how warlock = demonic even though he is GOO
[1:17:16] <%Ne1son> I kinda love Shadowheart
[1:17:16] <%caramelatte1> being murder hobos
[1:17:17] <%RyTYoung> oh no
[1:17:17] <BedHome> for fukin sure
[1:17:22] <BedHome> @Memitim its not!
[1:17:23] <%ladomania> you don't get exp for solving problems in real DND tho
[1:17:24] <ShoggothLord> Welcome to the shit that is D&D
[1:17:27] <BedHome> in 5e its not like that
[1:17:28] <Gribbin2> Shadowheart is waifu
[1:17:29] <%aslfrasle> It's the reason most 5e campaigns use milestone leveling.
[1:17:30] <%Bt_Robot> That's D&D mechanics
[1:17:31] <NimbusArchon> Competent DMs give XP for overcoming challenges, not necessarily killing them
[1:17:32] <BedHome> there are multiple ways to distribute experience
[1:17:33] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> milestone System
[1:17:33] <Mr_Strut> But that's the right way
[1:17:33] <%blitzrush1200> Yeah I thought the same thing too, but gale and shadowheart approved
[1:17:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> Didnt even know you could talk to them, i came form another direction and they instantly attacked
[1:17:34] <+Dhamilt> Thats not how it is in DnD 5e
[1:17:35] <%hax_metatron> Shadowheart is a dommy
[1:17:35] <%thelaxinator> No one ever got ripped by being persuasive
[1:17:35] <SmortyPuffin> no one does it in dnd cause your dm would shit
[1:17:35] <%toastybites> good ol Larian "Kill The Whole Town" Studios
[1:17:36] <%Smeagleman6> Well....Go fight them!
[1:17:36] <0rond> do people actually use that system, I thought everyone does milestones these days
[1:17:37] <%rdark_ksu> okay we got through everything smoothly, now to kill everyone on the way out
[1:17:40] <UndeadManatee> its up to your DM what its like
[1:17:41] <%Ynkubus_> Cant Tigtone your way through this
[1:17:41] <BedHome> and the dms guide gives you options
[1:17:42] <%chiazam> That how it is Dnd, most people aren't super about it
[1:17:42] <%thelaxinator> except gale apparently
[1:17:43] <+Dhamilt> You only gain exp from fighting
[1:17:45] <%Pappajimbo> it is but good gms will reward you for good roleplay
[1:17:45] <$Afterman_> they should maybe give you slightly less (but still some) xp for getting people to fuck off via dialog
[1:17:48] <%Cbenson> Cbenson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:17:48] <rekinom> our DM gives XP for conversation and RP /shrug
[1:17:51] <Habblewater> murderhobo is life for SINGLE PLAYER dnd
[1:17:52] <$RealThiele> ok its up to the dm to give exp for RP, and not codfied typically
[1:17:54] <ToneBacas> as once one great game designer once said, "Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."
[1:17:54] <%TheLemuroid> Anyone I know who DMs would give xp for dialog
[1:17:59] <Gieron667> every dnd game i watched has characters lvling from completing quests only
[1:18:00] <BedHome> Everyone i know uses milestone "end of a quest" xp, instead of individual combat xp
[1:18:00] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Have you ever heard the term murder hobo
[1:18:00] <+Memitim> @BedHome Base RAW, Adventurers League, etc. You kill monsters and that's it.
[1:18:06] <%Jekado> As a DM i give xp for circumventing encounters if done smartly
[1:18:10] <0rond> all the DMs I had used milestones
[1:18:10] <jpereta> that is really up to the DM, I give exp to my players if avoid combat. Or solved it.
[1:18:11] <Torgue_1> Nice!
[1:18:21] <SomeAsianDood> A zucchini Kappa Wonder where that can go?
[1:18:23] <+Ragnakawaii> 3
[1:18:24] <BedHome> @Memitim incorect. dms guide includes milestone experience among others
[1:18:25] <+Cyamos> go back and drop the cinder block on the crack
[1:18:30] <%Pappajimbo> lie cheat steal
[1:18:31] <+maximumcrit> Murder hobo? you mean scotchmo from Wasteland 3? LUL
[1:18:33] <+warlockwithapixie> they left thow
[1:18:34] <%ShogunNoonto> milestone xp is what my DM has to level up after this event kind of stuff
[1:18:35] <+fenriwolf> 3
[1:18:35] <$RealThiele> yea this is inch deep social interaction
[1:18:37] <deecomposer> gimblebraap
[1:18:41] <RedPanda25> 3
[1:18:43] <BedHome> @Memitim you ALWAYS get experience if you kill, but thats not the only way
[1:18:45] <ToneBacas> that being said, if something gives me XP (reward) and it's tedious and/or time-consuming and/or not fun, I'm probably still gonna do it
[1:18:52] <$Aitch971> as a DM fuck experience, milestone ftw
[1:18:57] <williamcvolk> D&D players used to try pouring boiling water over an anthill, under the assumption that each ant had to be worth at least 1 XP
[1:18:59] <%Jekado> yeah XP through only combat is a sign for a DM unless its a munchkin adventure.
[1:18:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Time to bash some heads
[1:19:01] <+professormorrigan> ?
[1:19:01] <Aydarkzero> Pat sure is good at lying Kappa
[1:19:02] <BedHome> milestone forever
[1:19:03] <Darren716> Wat
[1:19:06] <+gustavozxd> right away damn
[1:19:07] <+Memitim> @BedHome Reread what I said, in AL the only way to get XP is combat.
[1:19:08] <doodledumps> Because you lied to them haha
[1:19:10] <+storebrandcandy> you're not gimblybop
[1:19:11] <%Pappajimbo> suprise motherfucker
[1:19:11] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> still gotta fight anyway?
[1:19:12] <$RealThiele> yea milestones are way easier to handle and less feels bad for all
[1:19:14] <%chiazam> Murder him
[1:19:18] <+BlackSunEmperor> SOME FRYS, BITCH
[1:19:21] <ToneBacas> @williamcvolk that's pretty good 4Head
[1:19:23] <%rdark_ksu> 4 v 1. hmmm i wonder how that will go
[1:19:24] <%thelaxinator> jump
[1:19:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> KNOCK OUT @patstaresat
[1:19:26] <+Rakenshin> Kill em all, Pat
[1:19:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> tenderize his manflesh with demon power!
[1:19:29] <Darren716> This seems like an unfair fight
[1:19:32] <+GingerStrawhat> Hey Pat, How Newbie Friendly is this game? I was pretty interested based on your tweets!
[1:19:34] <BedHome> What the fuck is adventurers league. I play dnd 5e.
[1:19:35] <$Afterman_> because vampy boy is stuck behind others
[1:19:35] <+bundle_of_herbs> remember knock out
[1:19:35] <Habblewater> oh man i missed this combat system
[1:19:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everyones cluttered up
[1:19:45] <%chiazam> It's 4 vs 1 and you have a surprise round this is Easy clap
[1:19:47] <$PhantomMiG> Is it possible to no lethal
[1:19:54] <+Rakenshin> This is JUST Divine Divinity 2
[1:20:02] <+Memitim> @PhantomMiG yes
[1:20:12] <%thelaxinator> wut
[1:20:14] <%chiazam> Oh there is NON-LETHAL
[1:20:25] <+maximumcrit> Larian did such an amazing job with the bonus actions
[1:20:29] <%Pappajimbo> hu-man
[1:20:36] <williamcvolk> You should be able to move through friends
[1:20:37] <+yukichocomilk> humans EW
[1:20:37] <Coystick> Filthy human minority

[1:20:58] <backpackpackback> HEYOOO
[1:20:58] <jorniev> sneak attack
[1:21:03] <jpereta> sneak attack!
[1:21:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Cut him, Pat. I want you to cut im up
[1:21:15] <%thelaxinator> Eldritch Blast sounds like just yelling "JOHNS!" at the enemy and they can't handle it
[1:21:22] <%rdark_ksu> just cut the bastard
[1:21:23] <Daxalog> Hes in the way
[1:21:27] <$RealThiele> be nice if they just did a circle of movement you had access to reach
[1:21:31] <williamcvolk> Knocking someone unconscious deals regular damage and only knocks them out if it would otherwise kill them
[1:21:34] <+Memitim> pathing is a little bugged right now
[1:21:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> Push one of your team mates out of the way
[1:21:50] <NimbusArchon> Blast him

[1:28:33] <%thewordofhelix> WEAPONS WEIGH THE MOST

[1:28:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> Who wantsto be a mule
[1:28:43] <%chiazam> There should be an item to auto spread it out
[1:28:45] <%ShogunNoonto> pat that just 90% junk
[1:28:45] <JoshyJay> man why am i so heavy? pockets are full of garbage
[1:28:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt rogues can dash as a bonus action at level 2 if you need to cover distance quickly. I think it's hotkey 4 for our vampire boy
[1:28:49] <Xelgus> backpacks also help in inv management
[1:28:49] <%Ne1son> Sort by weight
[1:28:51] <%TrafficCohen> DUDE, YOU'VE GOT PLATES AND STARFISH AND QUILLS. Throw the trash away
[1:28:52] <%MisterRockett> You can't just drag and drop?????
[1:28:55] <$RealThiele> Warlock/paladin Multiclass
[1:28:57] <deecomposer> "GETS"
[1:28:59] <$Afterman_> @SomeAsianDood multiclass im pretty sure. he still has eldritch blast
[1:29:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> @SomeAsianDood Both
[1:29:12] <%SirGO0SE> sup gang
[1:29:13] <+Rakenshin> There are a ton of items in Larian games that are just junk and there for show
[1:29:16] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> @PatStaresAt How early access does this game feel?
[1:29:21] <%afronooch> yo goose
[1:29:23] <Aydarkzero> @SirGO0SE yo
[1:29:27] <BedHome> they really should have weight
[1:29:32] <%TrafficCohen> Fjord is a Heblad Pali
[1:29:35] <jpereta> can't the rogue throw the daggers in this game?
[1:29:35] <jacewolf_is_the_best> no longer cucumber
[1:29:36] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> majinoWoke
[1:29:37] <SomeAsianDood> I mean he's taking levels in pally only now right? @Afterman_ @Pookiedaexzile I know he's dual class after meeting the wildmother
[1:29:43] <+storebrandcandy> gravity doesn't real
[1:29:53] <BedHome> throw is an option!
[1:29:58] <AdmiralButtloaf> Get extra napkins when you get a hot and juicy beesechurger
[1:30:01] <+Rakenshin> How can item be real if our eyes aren't real?
[1:30:01] <BedHome> pat moused over it last stream but never tried it
[1:30:10] <%thelaxinator> featherfall is just convincing your target gravity isn't real
[1:30:10] <$RealThiele> Wildmother, please get me out of my bad deal
[1:30:13] <scarman125> i'm waiting for release anyway. missing classes like barbarian or paladin are a no from me
[1:30:17] <$Afterman_> @jpereta not yet, but i want some magicked daggers i can throw and recall. @SomeAsianDood and yeah true,he is only lvling pala now, but still
[1:30:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Throw some of your garbage at enemies, it'll be great
[1:30:25] <BedHome> becuase three rights make a left @Rakenshin
[1:30:31] <Picia000123> I've gotta say, this stream setup integrated into the game is very neat
[1:30:36] <+NitronStreams> Dirty Chest
[1:30:46] <%cureneckbeard> maybe it's a +1 candle
[1:30:52] <$RealThiele> Candle jacked
[1:30:57] <%Rakenshin> Rakenshin subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! You beat the first two Baldur's Gate games, right?
[1:31:05] <Diet_z_dan> this twitch intergration is nuts you can see everything whats equipped the stats mad
[1:31:12] <BedHome> PUT CANDLE IN HOLDER
[1:31:17] <%thelaxinator> Welp, we're in a dungeon, and there was a dragon earlier. So I'd call that mission accomplished.
[1:31:33] <$RealThiele> put, the candle, back!
[1:31:34] <%chiazam> huh
[1:31:35] <BedHome> damn
[1:31:35] <%thewordofhelix> DEFETE DOOR
[1:31:37] <BedHome> i was wrong
[1:31:43] <%thewordofhelix> JSUT SMACK IT
[1:31:55] <Picia000123> I remember the first BG being a bitch in the beginning, since a lvl 5 mage could fuck up your entire party
[1:32:01] <$RealThiele> learn knock
[1:32:09] <%cureneckbeard> You must gather your party before venturing forth
[1:32:12] <Picia000123> and you, being lvl1 mage was a fart in the wind
[1:32:29] <%AncelDeLambert> hey punks how's it goin?
[1:32:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat has made the mistake of Backtracking as first option
[1:32:35] <%thelaxinator> mage hand?
[1:32:35] <StromkoPenguin> Yeah BG1 was a lot tougher than 2 since whatever you played very few hitpoints.
[1:32:35] <%chiazam> Unselectable
[1:32:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> will he recover from this
[1:32:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Clever
[1:32:43] <Sol_Install> wow
[1:32:44] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, this looks like Larian
[1:32:44] <%Rakenshin> @Picia000123 What about two melee fights swinging at each other for a good minute and not hitting anything?
[1:32:45] <%thelaxinator> that works
[1:32:46] <%chiazam> Oh!?
[1:32:47] <Picia000123> @cureneckbeard dude, you have no idea how amazing that sentence sounds in polish
[1:32:53] <+Tommy_Armitage> look out below...
[1:32:57] <%cureneckbeard> no it's english
[1:33:00] <%GarbageNirvana> I was gonna say this is literally Fort Joy
[1:33:01] <%thelaxinator> Solve all problems with C'thulu lazers
[1:33:02] <Habblewater> my butthole on friday night
[1:33:07] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> @PatStaresAt Would you recommend the enhanced edition of baldur's gate 1 & 2?
[1:33:08] <+cognitohazardous> this looks like an area in divinity 2
[1:33:09] <Picia000123> @Rakenshin don't remind me NotLikeThis
[1:33:11] <+storebrandcandy> you hit a ninja turtle
[1:33:14] <%chiazam> Now feather fall in
[1:33:16] <%AncelDeLambert> jump down your dark hole, Pat
[1:33:16] <$RealThiele> BG1 had easy infinite gold tho if you got tired of dying
[1:33:21] <%ssjklyco> This kinda looks like the starting town in Divinity 2
[1:33:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Get in that hole
[1:33:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Feather Fall is for NERDS
[1:33:29] <BedHome> yooooooo
[1:33:33] <StromkoPenguin> ?? Doing that spawns more enemies.
[1:33:37] <BedHome> time to steal
[1:33:56] <jorniev> you can sneak around in the turn based mode
[1:34:07] <%chiazam> Your entire party should follow
[1:34:11] <$Afterman_> pat your icons looks separated in the bottom left, which mean they are not doing it as a party
[1:34:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "AAA"
[1:34:20] <Combat_Data> Make it so you can tell the whole party to go, but not automatically
[1:34:25] <Picia000123> it should be selectable at least
[1:34:26] <%thelaxinator> his current armor has disadvantage on stealth
[1:34:36] <tanarath> @theactuallyguyr7 The original versions are good if you can find them
[1:34:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> "We should make it that the whole part goes down...thats what I think" Pat bovin 2020
[1:34:43] <Combat_Data> Because there are great reasons to split parties
[1:34:56] <jacewolf_is_the_best> how
[1:35:01] <StromkoPenguin> Being shot through solid stone walls is a theme of this EA
[1:35:02] <+NitronStreams> is this a bug?
[1:35:02] <%thelaxinator> wat
[1:35:04] <BedHome> oh my god are they trying to fire through the wall and succeeding
[1:35:05] <+XxBTExX> Through the window, through the wall
[1:35:06] <therakishsage> Ghost door, apparently.
[1:35:06] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> @tanarath did the enhanced versions get fucked up or something?
[1:35:06] <%thewordofhelix> FAKE DOOR
[1:35:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wat?
[1:35:11] <%chiazam> Are they ATTACKING THROUGH THE WALL
[1:35:16] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:35:17] <jorniev> BUG
[1:35:21] <+sixcubit> haven't watched in a while, has pat gotten rid of his special brain worm yet? we need him to just have the normal amount of brain worms
[1:35:29] <jacewolf_is_the_best> 'its fine'
[1:35:32] <therakishsage> Sneak Attack has some conditions.
[1:35:35] <$Afterman_> brain worm still in brain
[1:35:36] <%Movemeister> keep fighting to find the door
[1:35:40] <+XxBTExX> His brain worn is now a stomach worm
[1:35:45] <+Ragnakawaii> you need advantage on the roll or have someone within 1.5m
[1:35:47] <%thelaxinator> @sixcubit no, he's still brain pregnant
[1:35:47] <noctambulant00> Door bugged because youve already been in here and you came through the secret entrance.
[1:35:52] <jpereta> you need to have an ally next to the target for the sneak attack to work
[1:35:52] <$Afterman_> time to make it rain
[1:35:59] <Xelgus> create water
[1:35:59] <$RealThiele> the brain worm population was culled by the mold
[1:36:01] <%Rakenshin> Welp
[1:36:03] <SolidusA> YIKES FOREVER
[1:36:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wall Hacks As bullshit
[1:36:15] <%Smeagleman6> The game REALLY likes throwing those god damn firebombs at you
[1:36:19] <%Smeagleman6> It sucks
[1:36:24] <williamcvolk> So far my only deaths in this game have been to the lack of pathfinding around environmental hazards
[1:36:28] <%thelaxinator> don't vampires kinda REALLY hate fire?
[1:36:35] <noctambulant00> isnt a wall hack, game is registering the door being open, so they can shoot through it
[1:36:37] <%ShogunNoonto> eldrich yeet
[1:36:40] <StromkoPenguin> Yeah I think 90% of encounters involve alchemist's fire or fire arrows.
[1:36:45] <Xelgus> water dude
[1:36:52] <+tinypouf> everyone in this game has a billion acid/fire bombs all the time
[1:36:53] <Xelgus> put out the fire
[1:36:56] <+TheBitingIrish> omg im on fire
[1:36:58] <williamcvolk> They also hate sunlight and not being invited into dungeons. I think this guy's a poser
[1:36:59] <%cureneckbeard> How did they get brain worms
[1:37:01] <+Memitim> @thelaxinator nah, more radiant than fite
[1:37:02] <+storebrandcandy> they gave you the ol hot feets
[1:37:02] <$RealThiele> its a cheap way to make non-threats annoying
[1:37:04] <+XxBTExX> @williamcvolk happened to me on a trap. Guys sorta bugged and walked back and forth about 6 times through a spike trap in like 2 seconds before i could even react
[1:37:08] <%chiazam> oh no
[1:37:10] <jpereta> @thelaxinator not in dnd.
[1:37:13] <$Afterman_> @cureneckbeard illithids
[1:37:16] <%Bt_Robot> FRIENDLY FIRE
[1:37:17] <+TheBitingIrish> rip
[1:37:18] <%Spydurman> no no no
[1:37:30] <%Spydurman> FRIENDLY FIRE
[1:37:33] <StromkoPenguin> He's an evoker so he has shaped spells around allies
[1:37:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> i think the saving tough was just to be pushed or not
[1:37:39] <%Smeagleman6> @StromkoPenguin It really gets annoying. Especially since your party starts all bunched up, and if you get crap initiative they just chuck firebombs at you until you die
[1:37:41] <+XxBTExX> I mean he didnt fall because of the saving throw but he still died because of the damage.
[1:37:42] <SomeAsianDood> evocation means no friendly fire though
[1:37:42] <BedHome> oooh nice
[1:37:46] <BedHome> i forgot evokers could do that
[1:37:47] <$Ernor_Woof> Wow, I didn't know this game was out yet.
[1:37:49] <BedHome> could choice pat
[1:37:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> cunning dash
[1:37:50] <williamcvolk> He can dash as a bonus action
[1:37:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> dammit
[1:37:54] <BedHome> *good choice pat
[1:38:01] <%Spydurman> oh right I forgot evokers don't have that
[1:38:10] <Picia000123> jesus I looked away for a minute, why is Pat dying
[1:38:15] <+TheBitingIrish> @Ernor_Woof Kinda, Early Access
[1:38:24] <$Afterman_> pat stood in fire
[1:38:37] <Picia000123> huh
[1:38:39] <Daxalog> Stood in fire x4
[1:38:44] <ToneBacas> blood everywhere
[1:38:57] <StromkoPenguin> Yeah leaping into the hole caused more bandits / adventurers to spawn, very odd.
[1:39:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> well, you did collapse part of the ceiling in the ruins, so...
[1:39:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> that made noise
[1:39:15] <%thelaxinator> is that off-brand chain mail?
[1:39:16] <ToneBacas> is this your idea of leaving a trail of blood so you know where you've already gone through?
[1:39:21] <%chiazam> Might not be too heavy for your cleric
[1:39:21] <noctambulant00> they were chillin in that other room, entering through the secret way moves them to the hall.

[1:41:34] <%chiazam> Where is she?
[1:41:34] <%thelaxinator> camp is eternal. It might as well be in your mind

[1:48:25] <%BinaryFireball> twitch extensions are weird
[1:48:27] <%RyTYoung> I used to watch Game Grump's stuff religiously, but fell off it and watched more sbfp instead
[1:48:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, Dan was always the more likable one.

[1:48:54] <extradopeness> game grumps? cringe
[1:48:59] <%thewordofhelix> @BedHome I recommend just starting to try one-shots, once people found out we were playing they started coming out of the woodwork. we just had them play NPCs till we found people we like.
[1:48:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Dan is easily the likeable one
[1:49:03] <%adzy2k6> he needs a basket and a dog cam :P
[1:49:04] <%rdark_ksu> hog tie the little piggy dog
[1:49:04] <%BinaryFireball> oh wow twitch extensions areawesome

[1:49:29] <BedHome> like at all lmao, im way out in a small town
[1:49:31] <%RyTYoung> They've bad at single player games, they're fine when it comes to multiplayer since they don't have to focus as much, or aren't being held at knifepoint when they don't be a game
[1:49:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I dropped it when Arin kept complaining about Majoras Mask XD
[1:49:39] <+MephioTV> sbfp were the only good lets players tbh, but now we have them in 3 seperate packages and that's cool
[1:49:42] <+GingerStrawhat> I check back in once in a while and still enjoy myself but don't stick around

[1:50:51] <The_Grey_Ghost> on the topic of why Grumps kinda sucks: Arin not trying to learn the game and actively ignoring prompts and tool tips, Dan kind of allowing Arin to flounder sometimes for multiple episodes and a few other things
[1:50:54] <%Saltmeisterr> chat what did i miss since last stream?
[1:50:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @GarbageQueenEllie Hi
[1:51:01] <%chiazam> Welp
[1:51:04] <extradopeness> ATB
[1:51:11] <+smevvster> Y'know I know they're supposedly just "testing" it right now, being EA and all, the entire party being evil feels really bad, when engaging with side-content makes them hate you. It's like the game doesn't want you to participate.
[1:51:13] <%brickwall35> DIO?

[1:53:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Arin is more incompetent at games than Woolie. Even at FPS. Change my mind.
[1:53:59] <$BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:54:05] <$joylent_blue> he is powerful
[1:54:12] <%BinaryFireball> and thus pat was sucked into the underdark

[1:54:33] <%deathscythe122887> @PatStaresAt Gief is like "No. MY FOOD. MINE
[1:54:41] <%Movemeister> feed him
[1:54:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @XeroSigmaPrime that would require me to care enough about the Grumps to have even seen Arin play anything to make a judgement
[1:54:49] <%adzy2k6> Was he trying to get the cats food?
[1:54:51] <%BoxNavy> well feed him again
[1:54:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Soon he will consume you and become the ultimate lifeform
[1:54:54] <$joylent_blue> and it will only continue LUL
[1:54:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> FEed him more
[1:54:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Arin sometimes surprises me with competence, like skipping the back of the roller coaster in SM Sunshine

[1:59:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> drink the juice pat
[1:59:10] <+MephioTV> It's because none of you have darkvision
[1:59:17] <Teyaric> Is there anything more ominous thana failed perception test.
[1:59:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> fwoosh!
[1:59:18] <+Tommy_Armitage> ooo magic wep
[1:59:19] <%trustycoyote> Think CDPR would be crazy enough to add Twitch integration into Cyberpunk which is already crazy ambitious?
[1:59:30] <%BinaryFireball> they should
[1:59:34] <%thewordofhelix> No helping chat.
[1:59:35] <%VashyronM> actually, everyone but the human has darkvision
[1:59:38] <%BinaryFireball> if larian can do it cdpr can
[1:59:46] <+REDtheBEAST> this smells trapped tomatoDread tomatoConcern
[1:59:52] <%Pappajimbo> give it to the wizard
[2:00:07] <%Ne1son> Read the action it gains Pat
[2:00:09] <Teyaric> It improves it's own accuracy! In a game like this, that's HUGE, Pat.
[2:00:10] <%trustycoyote> @BinaryFireball Not doubting that they would... just that it's ANOTHER thing to add to the game, ya know?
[2:00:10] <%Calek> kinda weird there's no "check for traps" button
[2:00:10] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt IF ITS MAGICAL IT CAN HIT GHOSTS
[2:00:12] <%chiazam> TRAPS
[2:00:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mmm fart clouds
[2:00:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Beware of crypt fungus, too
[2:00:31] <%BinaryFireball> @trustycoyote oh for sure, it's definitely an afterthrought
[2:00:38] <$Afterman_> put something heavy on it maybe Kappa
[2:00:44] <%deathscythe122887> @PatStaresAt She is the other member of your Asshole Crew. Her nose is flat and she is a bitch, but this girl is one hell of a Gith
[2:00:46] <%thewordofhelix> ahahahah
[2:00:48] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> lmao
[2:00:54] <%BinaryFireball> too strong pat
[2:00:56] <Kravus> Just drag and drop Pat lol
[2:00:56] <$Afterman_> dont throw
[2:00:58] <$Afterman_> just move
[2:01:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> can you click and drag stuff like in divinity?
[2:01:02] <+moustascheman> drag the box
[2:01:05] <ThirdPersonPhil> drag the object to move it, dont throw it.
[2:01:05] <%Smeagleman6> @PatStaresAt You can clcik and drag objects to move them like Divinity
[2:01:06] <Teyaric> Your resident evil training won't save you now!
[2:01:14] <$Afterman_> just left click and drag the box
[2:01:23] <%thewordofhelix> gotta be strong enough
[2:01:28] <%trustycoyote> Honestly, considering how much time and effort was spent on Cyberpunk, I hope they treat it like Witcher 3. Just keep updating it, being it up to date with future consoles etc.
[2:01:31] <%Smeagleman6> Get near them, and hold click and drag
[2:01:32] <$Afterman_> left click the box and just drag it
[2:01:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh cool
[2:01:51] <$Afterman_> can only move it so far at one time
[2:01:59] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> put skelton on gaspit
[2:02:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> so, is this fun?
[2:02:15] <ForeverDarkness> @PatStaresAt Any plans to play coop when they fix it?
[2:02:18] <%BinaryFireball> its super fun
[2:02:18] <%chiazam> You can also use your party members as weights?
[2:02:20] <%BinaryFireball> its a great game
[2:02:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Again, Shady looks totally different in that loading screen
[2:02:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> fun!
[2:02:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> never really played any game like this
[2:02:43] <StromkoPenguin> 2 player coop seems pretty solid, it gets more desyncs with more players
[2:02:46] <%BinaryFireball> ShadowSpleen
[2:02:55] <+professormorrigan> Just noticed that you can throw health pots near an ally and it'll splash to heal them.
[2:02:58] <@commanderclaw> Do Co Op with your Raid buddies who play D&D like Strident
[2:03:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> dip it in fire
[2:03:12] <+professormorrigan> Works on downed allies as well.
[2:03:12] <QuipSan> equip it?
[2:03:15] <+breakersnap> coop is pretty much broken
[2:03:18] <ThirdPersonPhil> you can equip it on a off hand
[2:03:31] <%Zeikier> Zeikier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! yo P, P, Peepee, and G! I finally started on DMC5 the other night and it kicks ass! As my first serious attempt at a DMC game I was worried character action would kick my ass but it flowed real well besides V, but I'm assuming he'll get better when I unlo
[2:03:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> Astarion looks like a twink
[2:03:40] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt put it in a weapon hand

[2:05:02] <+pectusumbra> HA. That's Amazing!
[2:05:05] <%ssjklyco> Lucky ted
[2:05:06] <Make_me_mad> Covering the vents made it so the grease didn't light up, at least.
[2:05:06] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[2:05:09] <%thewordofhelix> ahahaahahah, soo close
[2:05:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt I don't suppose you can craft nails into your boots to get non-slip like you can in DOS2?
[2:05:15] <%BinaryFireball> seriously lucky
[2:05:18] <+XxBTExX> greasy boy... basically a Smash player
[2:05:19] <+pectusumbra> literally falling on your ass saved you
[2:05:25] <+GenesisKnight> It has an effect
[2:05:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> but it glows
[2:05:30] <%ssjklyco> +
[2:05:30] <%thewordofhelix> ???? its pretty good actually
[2:05:32] <+MephioTV> It's actually pretty nice
[2:05:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> that has to mean it is good
[2:05:37] <%Malikial> The first 4 magical weapons I found in this game were spears.
[2:05:40] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt it gives you an action!
[2:05:40] <%Ne1son> Look at the action it gives you
[2:05:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> Glow = Good
[2:05:43] <+MephioTV> Advantage after a miss is really good
[2:05:44] <%Ne1son> Pat Read
[2:05:45] <%BinaryFireball> turn mode can save you a lot
[2:05:46] <$Afterman_> give spear to other party member you dont have yet
[2:05:47] <+AMagicalFlute> Pat and I are playing literally the same character except mine has a vagina and his has tits
[2:05:48] <+TheWarpJump> Read the bottom
[2:05:50] <+Tommy_Armitage> its magic tho
[2:05:52] <broostmonkey> @patstaresat READ IT
[2:05:53] <%thewordofhelix> it gives you a free true strike if you miss
[2:05:55] <+GenesisKnight> Read man
[2:05:56] <%BinaryFireball> look at the ability
[2:05:58] <%BinaryFireball> at the bottom
[2:05:58] <%cabooseteamkill> spear has a bonus effect near the bottom
[2:06:00] <+REDtheBEAST> NotLikeThis
[2:06:02] <AngryPhant0m> god dammit it been such a bad day that I cant even see pat kill his own party
[2:06:04] <Cyber_Dood> it's trash
[2:06:04] <$Dakuu75> PAT stop listening to ONE GUY
[2:06:10] <%chiazam> ohhhhhh
[2:06:11] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt DEATHS PRIMISE AT THE BOTTOM
[2:06:11] <%machshop> that's a promise
[2:06:12] <$Afterman_> look at bottom, deaths promise
[2:06:16] <+professormorrigan> you'll lose ac no go
[2:06:18] <%Ne1son> OHHHh
[2:06:20] <Dramtheater> psaBlep_SG
[2:06:23] <Cyber_Dood> lose 2 ac
[2:06:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> Vergil Twink
[2:06:25] <Make_me_mad> Jesus christ is that girl named Shadowheart?
[2:06:25] <%thewordofhelix> patron can.
[2:06:26] <+Shockrates20XX> It's a simple weapon, Patron can use it.
[2:06:30] <QuipSan> but its also strength
[2:06:32] <+MephioTV> Shadowheart is your only party member who can wield it at the cost of her shield
[2:06:32] <+professormorrigan> astarion works i guess
[2:06:35] <%thewordofhelix> im running it on my warlock right now
[2:06:36] <+MephioTV> wait
[2:06:36] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt everyone can equip anything. profficiency is like +2 to hit
[2:06:37] <+MephioTV> nbm
[2:06:43] <koffeemancer> I think your warlock can use it. Its a simple weapon
[2:06:43] <%BoxNavy> -2
[2:06:43] <+shabop> Some things in 5e take half damage from nonmagic weapons
[2:06:44] <%Pappajimbo> str
[2:06:47] <QuipSan> strength
[2:06:48] <Macfine> str mod
[2:06:48] <%VashyronM> strength
[2:06:49] <+Shockrates20XX> str
[2:06:50] <%aslfrasle> -1 to Strength
[2:06:52] <%BinaryFireball> proficency?
[2:06:53] <%chiazam> STRENGTH
[2:06:54] <%Rumbutt> str is -1
[2:06:54] <BedHome> PROFFICIENCY IS JUST +2 TO HIT
[2:06:54] <@commanderclaw> STR
[2:06:54] <%Smeagleman6> Uses STR
[2:07:03] <SomeAsianDood> strentgh mod
[2:07:10] <%chiazam> Isn't SHADOWHEART specced for STR?
[2:07:14] <%thewordofhelix> the spear charge is fun too if baddies line up
[2:07:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Be a strong Charm boy and break the game
[2:07:28] <%Ne1son> If only you had a key
[2:07:41] <koffeemancer> What was that key you got for? @PatStaresAt
[2:07:43] <%Pappajimbo> did you click the the other coffins
[2:07:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Str-charm
[2:07:47] <Cyber_Dood> or a lockpick
[2:08:02] <%Malikial> It's a simple reach weapon. Good for druids. Which are not in this build.
[2:08:12] <shruke> pocket sharing is such a good mechanic
[2:08:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> Boss Arena?
[2:08:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Issa Death box
[2:08:42] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I really hope you can optimize to play this game solo like the previous BG games.
[2:08:42] <$Dakuu75> someone fill me in. why is this "greetings travler" thing still on here?
[2:08:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> or Death Basket for the cultured
[2:09:04] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I wonder if Morpheus is in it,
[2:09:05] <$Dakuu75> -OMFG it was twitch, lol. nvm
[2:09:16] <%thewordofhelix> im just sad they dont have my boi the barbarian in the build yet. i would like to rage.
[2:09:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I hope the Hexblade patron for the Warlock gets in.
[2:09:45] <Cyber_Dood> slow movement
[2:09:55] <Cyber_Dood> walking speed
[2:09:55] <+chiazam> Can Armor not scale with Strength!?
[2:09:58] <+TheWarpJump> double your weight slows you
[2:09:58] <SomeAsianDood> movement halved?
[2:09:59] <+pectusumbra> It's usuall encumbrance type stuff
[2:09:59] <%Pappajimbo> it cam reduce your movent in combat i think
[2:09:59] <AdmiralButtloaf> your wizard looks like chris hemsworth
[2:10:00] <+maximumcrit> @PatStaresAt you can rightclick on items and send em to the camp
[2:10:03] <%thewordofhelix> @PatStaresAt if you right click on items you can send them to camp
[2:10:04] <shruke> Hexblade is so cool
[2:10:05] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Right click on an item and send it to camp
[2:10:05] <+pectusumbra> Though I don't know what it would be in the game
[2:10:06] <+Arkfyre> hexblade is rad
[2:10:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why hasn't someone made a good a Looter shooter Rpg with dnd classes and subclasses. it seems like easy money
[2:10:08] <QuipSan> you can right click item and send to your companion
[2:10:08] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt slower movement IN COMBAT
[2:10:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> bluuh
[2:10:24] <$Dakuu75> this looks like a party
[2:10:24] <%rdark_ksu> hey its the sigil thingy
[2:10:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> there is a chest in the camp and aparently youc an sent stuf to it
[2:10:38] <shruke> Man the blood and the sand looks JUST like divinity
[2:10:57] <%Malikial> Why are you sending your scrolls? They're so useful bro.
[2:11:01] <+moustascheman> let gale learn scrolls
[2:11:07] <%thewordofhelix> MUH SCROLLS
[2:11:15] <%Fenrisulfr_V> But yeah, I really want to be able to build a character to solo the game. Was one of the more fun parts of the first two games.
[2:11:16] <+TheWarpJump> You can also put backpacks in your inventory and put items inside them
[2:11:19] <StromkoPenguin> Wares can be autosold, somehow.
[2:11:29] <@commanderclaw> Yup
[2:11:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There ought to be a select all
[2:11:48] <@SoFarFetched> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:11:50] <jorniev> why is patron carrying everything?
[2:11:54] <+maximumcrit> yeah inventory management was annoying af in divinity 1 & 2 too
[2:12:11] <%hax_metatron> It was the worst part of D:OS2
[2:12:16] <%thewordofhelix> you'll find a merchant soonish
[2:12:16] <%BoxNavy> download more inventory
[2:12:19] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Give all your scrolls to the wizard. He can add Wizard spells to his book if he's the level to cast it.
[2:12:21] <%hax_metatron> Especially for someone like me that likes neatly organizing my inventory
[2:12:21] <%crimsonharvest> lol fuckin video games with scrolls in them
[2:12:23] <jorniev> BUY A PACK MULE
[2:12:24] <%hax_metatron> D:OS2 was a nightmare
[2:12:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> "MY boys are Filling up" Patrick Bovin 2020
[2:13:03] <+TheWarpJump> They have controller support for this right?
[2:13:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They said that Marie was best Persona girl
[2:13:27] <%Fenrisulfr_V> This game is in pre early access, so maybe.
[2:13:38] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah this would be IMPOSSIBLE with controller
[2:13:42] <@SoFarFetched> with how many keys do what.
[2:13:52] <Macfine> exactly the same as divinity does..
[2:13:55] <@SoFarFetched> just do b utton combinations
[2:13:56] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:14:03] <$Dakuu75> If FF14 can do controler support so well, anyone should be able to
[2:14:06] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Is this game getting a console release, or is it PC only?
[2:14:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> This would be easy as hell with a controller
[2:14:11] <%Ynkubus_> Unless it did FF14s setup stuff
[2:14:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> give me 3 mass effect wheels
[2:14:14] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Not that I own a console, I'm just curious.
[2:14:15] <@SoFarFetched> PC only,they said it wouldn't work on console.
[2:14:17] <+Shockrates20XX> Well Divinity has action costs, so it's kinda the same.
[2:14:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> per character
[2:14:30] <shruke> Pat can Gale learn spells from scrolls?
[2:14:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> per build
[2:14:38] <+Exicuren> Well, it's going to come put to the Stadia, so it's gonna need cotroller support
[2:14:42] <%Bt_Robot> mISSED A BODY
[2:14:47] <%Fenrisulfr_V> He was listed as a Wizard, so I assume so. @shruke
[2:14:56] <+TheWarpJump> Lol they have controller support on stadia only
[2:14:59] <+OmegaWeltall> i never saw that FUCKING lever there !!! NotLikeThis
[2:15:00] <@SoFarFetched> Stadia's not a console Kappa
[2:15:08] <%chiazam> No swimming?
[2:15:16] <+Shockrates20XX> Gale can learn all spells from any scroll, and it's kind of overpowered and will hopefully be fixed by release. Wizards don't need to be able to cast healing spells.
[2:15:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Wait, why would these characters be surprised that the scribes are carrying quarterstaves? Staves are one of the most common arcane foci.
[2:15:51] <Hammerknife> wait what? i thought wizards could convert any spell slots into a cure wounds
[2:16:00] <%crimsonharvest> maybe going around armed is the weird part
[2:16:05] <+Shockrates20XX> @Hammerknife God no.
[2:16:26] <PirateMike_> Try clicking with Shadowheart
[2:16:28] <shruke> @Shockrates20XX Oh yeah wizards are only supposed to be able to learn wizard spell list spells
[2:16:33] <+OmegaWeltall> Kappa
[2:16:37] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt try having someone else read the inscription! they know different languages
[2:16:42] <+OmegaWeltall> this fight whooped my ass
[2:16:46] <%Fenrisulfr_V> There was a Wizard variant in earlier editions called the Mystic Theurge that could use cleric spells, but it never made it out of playtesting in 5e.
[2:16:47] <%Bt_Robot> SECRET DOOR
[2:16:51] <@SoFarFetched> Now the couch is gonna be wet
[2:16:52] <koffeemancer> Jombies!

[2:17:57] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Shockrates20XX I knew it was something like that. I've only played AD&D, Pathfinder, and 5e.
[2:18:03] <%thewordofhelix> better start buffing yourself now.
[2:18:10] <mechengineers> JUST finished this fight and then the game crashed
[2:18:10] <Picia000123> they had those neat orbs of magic too
[2:18:18] <shruke> Anyone know if you can hold actions?
[2:18:23] <koffeemancer> Maybe radiant bolt does more damage to the undead? @PatStaresAt
[2:18:24] <PirateMike_> F

[2:18:46] <%Malikial> @PatStaresAt If you would have taken all the loot off every skeleton in this room they would have nothing right now. It makes this fight hilarious
[2:18:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> Skeletons Hate Being hit by hard things, and They really hate holy magics
[2:18:48] <%BoxNavy> paige at risk
[2:18:51] <%thewordofhelix> when did he last save?
[2:18:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @koffeemancer Not if this is based on 5e, it does.
[2:19:00] <%Rumbutt> Larian catering to Paige I see
[2:19:04] <mechengineers> PS the turn dead acts as aoe wave
[2:19:07] <SwindlerOfProgress> Yeah, I only ever expect to deal with my own

[2:19:13] <Goodvibes99508> focus fire
[2:19:13] <mr_slaide> Keep the high ground.
[2:19:18] <%crimsonharvest> You can hide a _lot_ of skeletons inside stuff like tombs, dirt, walls, living people
[2:19:24] <+moustascheman> sneak attack
[2:19:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> If this is actually based on 5e, skeletons aren't vulnerable to radiant, just blunt damage.
[2:19:30] <+Exicuren> Can you do the nasty sick stylish thing like DOS2? like throw grease, put it on fire, throw water, you have vapor and electrocute it?
[2:19:32] <%thewordofhelix> ROMANCE SKELETONS

[2:20:06] <%Malikial> Exicuren. YOu can definitely combo grease and webs with fire.
[2:20:11] <Picia000123> MAGIC MISSILE
[2:20:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Hell yeah, big boy failed his save.

[2:21:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But Pat, why hit turned skelly?
[2:21:12] <%Bailey__gaming> M O R T I S
[2:21:27] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt turning enemies makes them run, hitting enemies undoes that
[2:21:34] <aeonicvector> Not stabalizing the rogue
[2:21:34] <+moustascheman> healing word on downed allies revives them
[2:21:41] <%KishinGrek> shows the need game for nerds going?
[2:21:51] <%Rakenshin> Only 2 more
[2:21:54] <%Malikial> @PatStaresAt It sounds stupid but Shadowheart is strong enough where JUMPING max distance and then running the rest of her movement moves her further each round than just moving.
[2:21:59] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt stabilising helps people on the floor making death saves
[2:22:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> We not gonna get him up
[2:22:02] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Wait, does the cleric not know Spare the Dying?
[2:22:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's one tough Shady
[2:22:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> ?
[2:22:07] <%KishinGrek> so how is the nerd game for nerds going?
[2:22:28] <shruke> oooo is there permadeath for party memebers?

[2:22:48] <aeonicvector> You coulda healed him NotLikeThis
[2:22:54] <shruke> Pat you can assist the downed ally
[2:23:03] <%Malikial> @Fenrisulfr_V Every character in the party can spare the dying. It's a balance thing.
[2:23:07] <%chiazam> Maybe help the rogue
[2:23:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does pat now know about death saves
[2:23:20] <aeonicvector> HEAL

[2:23:31] <+Shockrates20XX> You can cast a healing spell on him. Or use the Help command
[2:23:31] <%thewordofhelix> under the bonus actions on the right

[2:24:00] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Malikial Every character can stabilize. Spare the Dying is a cleric cantrip that auto stabilizes. Unless that's a change for this game specifically.

[2:24:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> I like her
[2:24:20] <%Rakenshin> Shadowheart needs some....SERIOUS work on her face for the final game

[2:24:48] <%rdark_ksu> I think there is some Drow guy who like scimitars. fuzzy on the name tho
[2:24:53] <%Malikial> @PatStaresAt You don't have to heal him. You can auto help him up with the Help action that's on your bonus actions bar.
[2:24:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It was pretty baller.
[2:25:03] <$joylent_blue> ballin' boivin

[2:25:27] <%Malikial> @PatStaresAt Also if you loot all the skeles in the room that fight is simple because all their strong magic is on scrolls.

[2:30:42] <jorniev> HAHAHHAA
[2:30:45] <+trigglypuf> Aw man I was hoping he was an actual party member
[2:30:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This looks a lot like a "later" party member

[2:30:54] <%caramelatte1> Developer note
[2:30:56] <%Malikial> @PatStaresAt Tieflings get mad hate because people think they sold their soul to a demon... But I mean, you're playing a warlock so they are... not wrong.
[2:30:56] <%Bt_Robot> HE THINK YOU STUPID
[2:30:57] <+luftraumm1> I'm reading that as he'll join soon
[2:30:57] <%blitzrush1200> Shadowheart might be racist or just salty

[2:31:07] <%Fenrisulfr_V> God, he looks great.
[2:31:07] <@commanderclaw> He might be an Archlich: A lich made by a deity
[2:31:14] <%Smeagleman6> Nah Shadowheart's pretty racist
[2:31:28] <+Shockrates20XX> 5th Ed has moved away from a lot of the "X is inherently good/evil" which might include becoming a Lich.
[2:31:30] <+luftraumm1> oof this game looks so good
[2:31:32] <Decarcassor> This dude was chillng in a temple of Jergal. Thats some old shit.
[2:31:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Racism in RPGs is a lot of fun, and sometimes justified?

[2:31:50] <%Ne1son> Lichdom should always be an evil act
[2:31:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> Whats evil about not wanting to die
[2:31:58] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> skyrim is full of racists
[2:32:04] <%huskarl_zap> LAWFUL EVIL
[2:32:07] <+luftraumm1> this looks a lot like divinity
[2:32:09] <%Ne1son> Mostly the how you do it
[2:32:10] <Macfine> Even in 5e Lichedom is 99% of the time evil
[2:32:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Depends on how the undeath is achieved.
[2:32:19] <SolsticeZro> oh no he didn't do the cache yet LUL
[2:32:22] <+pectusumbra> @Shockrates20XX while there are rare cases of good liches of certain types, liches are usually evil due to needing some kind of terrible sacrifice to make ti work or a pact with Orcus, demon of undeath
[2:32:22] <%blitzrush1200> Yeah I mean I can't imagine being peaceful with mindflayers
[2:32:23] <$Afterman_> give lazael the spear
[2:32:27] <%BoxNavy> a o
[2:32:28] <Decarcassor> The regular way of becoming a lich require some pretty evil stuff. But this guy might not be a standard lich.
[2:32:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> I mean is it so evil to want to live for ever and gain infinite power
[2:32:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Babe?!?! BAAAAABE!!!
[2:32:29] <%Fenrisulfr_V> There are a handful of liches that got there the not-evil way.

[2:35:32] <%caramelatte1> Race traitorism
[2:35:33] <QuipSan> Astarion loves evil
[2:35:33] <jorniev> NON LETHAL
[2:35:35] <%blitzrush1200> Oh big surprise Astarion loves murder
[2:35:36] <jacewolf_is_the_best> pat is rat man
[2:35:41] <Macfine> I got them to leave before I let her down
[2:35:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> NON LETHAL
[2:35:43] <+GingerStrawhat> Man Shadow Heart why you gotta be like that
[2:35:43] <+pectusumbra> At least go non-lethal yeah
[2:35:44] <%huskarl_zap> She lawful neutral tbh
[2:35:52] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt non lethal is always an option
[2:35:54] <%Malikial> Shadowheart HATES Githyanki. If you play one you have to past a 14+ test to get her to not just be like. Fuck off and refuse to join your party the MOMENT you see her.
[2:35:54] <+DazzlingFuhrer> Not Very True Strike
[2:36:01] <%Calek> yes attack with your strength weapons of which you have no bonuses
[2:36:07] <Macfine> You only need to non lethal the last hit
[2:36:10] <+luftraumm1> she lawful neutral??? with that murder boner?
[2:36:10] <+KatanaMancer> only final hit needs to be non lethal
[2:36:10] <%thewordofhelix> need to do damage first
[2:36:12] <%emperordread> Shadowheart is basically Morrigan from DA:O
[2:36:13] <Decarcassor> Thats the one thing that annoy me about the game so far. It love to give you theses "cake or death" choices with no middle ground. :/
[2:36:14] <Ipsenscastle> Pat crazy talked True Strike
[2:36:17] <+RAH001> i thought the game said that lol
[2:36:17] <QuipSan> its hard
[2:36:21] <+TheWarpJump> I think knock out only works if it takes them to zero helth
[2:36:22] <%thewordofhelix> just like catching a pokemon
[2:36:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> this is a pretty poor situation for this thieflings, the lady is in the box art
[2:36:24] <+KatanaMancer> every attack normal then final hit non lethal
[2:36:24] <%caramelatte1> lol rekt
[2:36:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BLINDED HER FRIEND
[2:36:28] <shruke> nonlethal is like catching a pokemon
[2:36:29] <jacewolf_is_the_best> hit you with the rainbow
[2:36:30] <%chiazam> Non-lethal the last hit
[2:36:36] <+luftraumm1> colour spray has become viable
[2:36:36] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Color spray, whoo!
[2:36:45] <therakishsage> The way non-lethal takedowns work is to deal 1-4 damage. If you lower them to 1 health with it, they get knocked out. @PatStaresAt
[2:36:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Oh wait no that's green lady
[2:36:51] <%Smeagleman6> Much easier to just stab everything to death
[2:36:53] <+professormorrigan> D:
[2:36:54] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> welp
[2:36:54] <%reinbachthe3rd> Kinky. Kreygasm
[2:36:54] <%blitzrush1200> True to form
[2:36:55] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> @PatStaresAt nonlethal only works on last hit
[2:36:55] <+RiseRequiem> @PatStaresAt Knock-Out isn't a chance to knock them out. It is a non-lethal attack if the enemy is about to die, so you can knock them out
[2:36:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Well, YEAH
[2:36:55] <$Dakuu75> greese lightning~!
[2:36:56] <+GingerStrawhat> Welp we tried

[2:37:17] <seaechiowai> oh so batman methodology of non lethality
[2:37:17] <%emperordread> Lae [body count go up] zel
[2:37:20] <Decarcassor> Githyankis don't give a fuck.
[2:37:28] <%apolitenoob> Pretty sure Non-lethal is just supposed to be used as a finisher right?
[2:37:29] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt shove him when he stands on grease
[2:37:31] <+luftraumm1> evil stuff is boring
[2:37:36] <+KatanaMancer> knockout ONLY final hit
[2:37:41] <jpereta> cast sleep!
[2:37:46] <shruke> oh she is going to murder him
[2:37:46] <therakishsage> Because most people are, generally good if at least not evil. @prime_name
[2:37:50] <+NohbdyIsCrash> If this works like actual DnD, wouldn't knock unconscious just be the final strike?
[2:37:56] <azon2021> dont you need to weaken them first to KO? like pokemon
[2:38:07] <%huskarl_zap> @luftraumm1 They trapped her and planned on executing her shes justified and trained to be a warrior whos only occupation is to fight and die against Mindflayers.
[2:38:08] <SolsticeZro> She is gonna kill them anyway

[2:46:33] <%BinaryFireball> true

[2:46:36] <+tinypouf> eat gale, absorb his strength

[2:46:40] <%huskarl_zap> chad Gale
[2:46:40] <Gieron667> so Pat you are the worst then ?
[2:46:41] <smallheals> pat you can place boxes in this dimension
[2:46:42] <+gustavozxd> being a narcissist must be awesome tho

[2:46:42] <%SirGO0SE> plagueFace
[2:46:43] <$Futurecity10> arent you a narcissist?
[2:46:43] <Goodvibes99508> not in their opinions
[2:46:44] <%BoxNavy> pats not a narcissist hes an egomaniac
[2:46:44] <%thelaxinator> Is "Send to Camp" broken?
[2:46:46] <%Neryl_> @PatStaresAt What? Narcissists are the best. Just as a narcissist.
[2:46:46] <MemMoor> have you met yourself
[2:46:48] <+pectusumbra> Almost like CURRENT EVENTS
[2:46:50] <Timurine> No self awareness
[2:46:54] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> i see pat as a realist
[2:46:55] <+luftraumm1> there's no one that isn't at least bit narcissistic
[2:46:55] <+Redtaco98> pat just drag it over

[2:46:58] <+trigglypuf> He’s a lesser narcissistic
[2:46:58] <%BinaryFireball> just drag and drop yo
[2:46:59] <Xelgus> in what way is Gale a narcissist? cause he was checking out his reflection to see if he was dying from brain bug?
[2:47:00] <%IncredibleMeh> narcissist are for real horrific individuals

[2:47:06] <+lordericter> Man I hope there's a BG2 moment where La'Zael and Shadow force one or the other out of the party or kill eachother 12 hours in
[2:47:08] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt he isnt a narssisist, hes just vain. He is actually the goodest of boiz in the roster
[2:47:08] <%hax_metatron> Literally think of anyone other than yourself all the time. Narcissists: NO
[2:47:08] <frankavich> The solution is to not pick up everything you see!
[2:47:09] <stabbityrabbit> Narcissism goes hand in hand with anti-social behavior though...
[2:47:10] <+Byronic_dreamer> I mean, psychopaths are kinda worse @patstaresat
[2:47:12] <%SweetCheeksTVR> drag and drop you dingus
[2:47:15] <%crimsonharvest> how about its not important its mostly literal trash
[2:47:21] <Decarcassor> He is supposed to be a wizard "prodidgy". Big talk for a level 2 boring human wizard with average stats.
[2:47:22] <+luftraumm1> its human nature to be narcissistic
[2:47:30] <+Taglog7> r/raisedbynarcissist

[2:48:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> Shut up! Noses are fine
[2:48:39] <%Calek> I love her so much
[2:48:39] <%chiazam> 2
[2:48:40] <%NovaKnightmare> BE RACIST PAT
[2:48:40] <@SoFarFetched> "it isn't THAT large"
[2:48:40] <%Meekest> Pat is so into her
[2:48:41] <dmastermonk> 2
[2:48:43] <%adzy2k6> 3
[2:48:45] <+REDtheBEAST> should have killed her when you had the chance..
[2:48:49] <%Rakenshin> Tell her to go back to the Gremlins movie
[2:48:49] <%blitzrush1200> Doesn't get srcasm
[2:48:49] <trianglehat> tsundere
[2:48:51] <scarman125> i would have said 2 in a heartbeat
[2:48:51] <$Dakuu75> what... a... BITCH~! lol
[2:48:56] <%Calek> when we get the tadpoles out of our heads we're going to be best friends
[2:48:58] <+luftraumm1> I hate the gith design
[2:49:00] <%rdark_ksu> fuckin hell the option to pick is gone before I can read em
[2:49:01] <%Malikial> I love how rude she is.
[2:49:01] <%Bt_Robot> SHE SEEMS JUST TSUN ENOUGH FOR PAT TO LOVE
[2:49:03] <RinWR> Unrelenting bitching
[2:49:03] <%Malikial> I LOVE it.
[2:49:04] <Kravus> Lae'Zel sounds like Drak before he mellowed out
[2:49:06] <+TheBitingIrish> How can she even smell anything with nose that small? DansGame
[2:49:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I really like her. Talking to her is a blast
[2:49:09] <Xelgus> but sure, Gale is the problem here
[2:49:10] <%thelaxinator> Lucky Pat gets to chose between multiple flavors of bitchiness
[2:49:11] <+gustavozxd> she's hot, so morally grey @patstaresat
[2:49:11] <%NovaKnightmare> Why does she talk like an edgy mary sue character
[2:49:15] <%Smeagleman6> God, I love Lae'zel
[2:49:20] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt gawd I want her to bully me uwu
[2:49:21] <Gieron667> her hands seem to be stuck doing just one motion
[2:49:24] <happyfacespam> she kinda sounds like Sylvanas a bit, with the attitude to match
[2:49:25] <jorniev> man sarcasm must piss the fuck out of the gith
[2:49:26] <$Dakuu75> Patron's perma-smug-face lmao I love it
[2:49:26] <%chiazam> I WONDER HOW'D SHE'D ACT IF YOU WERE THE SAME RACE
[2:49:39] <%BoxNavy> yeah we know
[2:49:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hoooot
[2:49:45] <+TheBitingIrish> So Ebola?
[2:49:45] <Doomstar16> Sounds disgusting.
[2:49:46] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> tell me moar
[2:49:48] <%Meekest> Yeah we know
[2:49:49] <+gnoame> She's getting all excited about bleeding
[2:49:51] <%Rakenshin> Yeah yeah, we heard this before Gith
[2:49:52] <+NitronStreams> Gale's version was better
[2:49:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> you literally SAW IT HAPPEN 2 DAYS AGO
[2:49:58] <%Typhaeon> God her mocap is incredible
[2:49:59] <%chiazam> Is that how you say orifice
[2:50:02] <asurite_warrior> 1
[2:50:03] <jpereta> to be fair. in the monster manual all githyanki are evil
[2:50:05] <happyfacespam> rooH gore
[2:50:05] <%NovaKnightmare> 2
[2:50:05] <%GarbageNirvana> She is way too into this
[2:50:08] <Frostilk> rising panic LUL
[2:50:13] <Gieron667> yea her hand motions are broken or unfinished
[2:50:13] <%thelaxinator> but do my memories carry over though? Because being a mind flayer sounds kinda rad.
[2:50:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> i bet ever party member talks about that shit, except the rogue cause he is a dumb dumb
[2:50:14] <@SoFarFetched> she disapproves D:
[2:50:16] <%BoxNavy> 1 2 3 4
[2:50:19] <+MisterMusashi> She acts pretty similar but calls you "kin", I think
[2:50:21] <+luftraumm1> hahahahhahah
[2:50:22] <+gustavozxd> @chiazam I bet you can be a racist duo with her LUL
[2:50:23] <%rdark_ksu> i like her cat eyes
[2:50:25] <$Caped_Eggy> as they should
[2:50:25] <+Ragnakawaii> just stop being unlikable
[2:50:26] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt stop being so unlikable blue man
[2:50:26] <%Parapattern> Well, you are a scoundrel
[2:50:26] <Cal_ixo> You love it
[2:50:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Mean Green hates your cowardice
[2:50:28] <Decarcassor> To be fair, the Goths hate everyone.
[2:50:29] <%BinaryFireball> they dont hate you they just dont trust you
[2:50:29] <%blitzrush1200> She doesn't like bitches
[2:50:30] <%cvp5127> "dont be a bitch"
[2:50:31] <Plus_On_Black> she's everything.
[2:50:32] <Decarcassor> *Giths
[2:50:34] <+trigglypuf> Hair starts falling out ? Pat you’re becoming a mind flayer
[2:50:34] <%Bt_Robot> PAT WHY DO YOU HAVE AN ERECTION?
[2:50:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If you want this one to like you, you gotta have BALLS
[2:50:37] <%huskarl_zap> devil man cry baby
[2:50:39] <+Arkfyre> maybe it your dumb hat they dont like
[2:50:39] <jorniev> bitch i dont care
[2:50:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Become an Ulitharid
[2:50:45] <Xelgus> and we wonder why good companions are more popular
[2:50:51] <+luftraumm1> I wonder what happens if you are gith
[2:50:58] <Doomstar16> Well that was fun.
[2:51:00] <%Smeagleman6> Highly suggest Great Weapon Fighting
[2:51:00] <%TheFabledAble> xD
[2:51:02] <%reinbachthe3rd> So... are they like orcs?
[2:51:04] <%heartlesshealer> strong woman
[2:51:07] <%chiazam> Wow she really dumped CHA
[2:51:07] <SolsticeZro> Woyer Woman
[2:51:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> She is bae
[2:51:09] <%Ne1son> Give her the spear
[2:51:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> she needs a pair of pants
[2:51:10] <Doomstar16> Action surge is SO good.
[2:51:11] <jorniev> she is so EXTRA
[2:51:13] <+threamstream> does pat's thing for bitchy girls only extend to red heads?
[2:51:14] <@commanderclaw> Action surge refreshes on a short rest
[2:51:14] <%blitzrush1200> Diplomacy isn't her strong suit
[2:51:18] <happyfacespam> SMOrc good stat roll
[2:51:20] <+threamstream> Cause I think I found a winner
[2:51:21] <tanarath> @reinbachthe3rd Kiiiinda?
[2:51:21] <%hax_metatron> Watching the Gith in this game, makes me look at the Githzerai in Planescape: Torment completely differently
[2:51:22] <%Nekros4442> BIG STICK ALL THE WAY
[2:51:24] <%chiazam> GWF GWF GWF
[2:51:24] <%TheFabledAble> with great weapon fighting she is a monster
[2:51:29] <RedPanda25> Pat ppl love to hate you
[2:51:30] <+luftraumm1> she seems to be geared towards great weapons
[2:51:34] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Imma do a barbarian fighter build when I play. Any build suggestion from what you've done so far?
[2:51:37] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt you cant change these later but do get a couple of them
[2:51:39] <%chiazam> big number
[2:51:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> SHE SMOL
[2:51:50] <SolsticeZro> Her hair is freaking out LUL
[2:51:50] <@SoFarFetched> HER HAIR IS GOING NUTS
[2:51:51] <stabbityrabbit> Great Weapon Fighting is even better with a Greatsword/Greathammer. Greataxes get kinda screwed for no reason.
[2:51:55] <%thelaxinator> her hair is freakin' out
[2:52:03] <%chiazam> @asurite_warrior They don't have barbarian yet
[2:52:04] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt great weapon fighting is amazing, if you find a greatsword they do 2d6 which means 2 chances to proc great weapon fighting
[2:52:05] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt also any magic weapons can hit ghosts
[2:52:06] <+Rofiarf> make sure its not an absolute weapon
[2:52:10] <%thelaxinator> she is in fact pretty short for what she is
[2:52:13] <%chiazam> take it off
[2:52:14] <@commanderclaw> Her armor is the lewdest in the party
[2:52:14] <+Brosevelt> i dont think spear works with Great Weapon Fighting
[2:52:17] <Decarcassor> If you know anything about Githyanki Knight you can assume she will find a Sliver Greatsword at some point so Great Weapon Fighting is good. But it does not matter in the EA. :p
[2:52:19] <Goodvibes99508> @patstaresat give that gith a spear githes love spears
[2:52:24] <%reinbachthe3rd> Spooopy ghosts.
[2:52:27] <Ner234> FUCK ghosts
[2:52:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I want all the party members in this game to be evil bitches. It'll be awesome
[2:52:30] <%heartlesshealer> slap ghost
[2:52:30] <%Bt_Robot> PISS OFF GHOST
[2:52:31] <+MephioTV> it works
[2:52:35] <QuipSan> it works
[2:52:36] <+luftraumm1> I'm not sure spears work with great weapons
[2:52:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> One guy
[2:52:44] <%Emperor_Machinus> Are ghosts a skeleton's skeleton?
[2:52:44] <SolsticeZro> Should be
[2:52:47] <%heartlesshealer> spear is two handed, but not a "great" type weapon?
[2:52:47] <+MephioTV> if it works like 5e it should
[2:52:48] <%emperordread> Bitch [N-Pass+ subscription required] ghosts
[2:52:49] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> It does, in baldur's gate they made spears 2 handed rather then Versatile
[2:52:51] <+threamstream> dude just ask the dm
[2:52:52] <SolsticeZro> It takes 2 slots
[2:52:53] <%Ne1son> psa1guy
[2:52:54] <%heartlesshealer> what does great weapon fighting say?
[2:52:54] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt spears work with great weapon fighting
[2:52:57] <%chiazam> Where is it?
[2:52:57] <+MisterMusashi> Great Weapon Fighting works
[2:52:59] <stabbityrabbit> Greatswords are ideal, but the spear will work.
[2:53:00] <%GarbageNirvana> That's been a D&D thing forever, only magic hits ghosts
[2:53:01] <Dellago> Spear is versatile, not great weapon sadly
[2:53:02] <%Rakenshin> ZOMBIE GHOSTS, LEAVE THIS PLACE
[2:53:03] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt it does work but two handed fighting gets even better if the weapon does multiple dice in dmg, like a greatsword which is 2d6
[2:53:09] <+Rofiarf> yeah, they need to add that
[2:53:09] <%heartlesshealer> okay good
[2:53:14] <Big_Dream> class features
[2:53:14] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> look in the class
[2:53:15] <+Rofiarf> i couldn't find the stuff you earned
[2:53:16] <%Calek> @Dellago in BG3 it's two handed
[2:53:18] <%Ne1son> under class
[2:53:22] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> fighting style is a class option
[2:53:26] <jpereta> It should work with any weapon you can use with two-hands
[2:53:30] <+chiazam> BUG
[2:53:31] <+MisterMusashi> That's a Pike, tho, I think
[2:53:31] <Dellago> Oh is it? Hopefully it works with the feat then
[2:53:35] <%TheFabledAble> its bugged, try resting with her
[2:53:37] <therakishsage> User Interface still needs some work. It's not listed anywhere that I've found.
[2:53:41] <+lordericter> its weird cuz in 5e there is specifically a skill called polearm mastery which is great weapon but for spears and weapons with reach but I doubt Larian was that in depth
[2:53:41] <%heartlesshealer> did you go through her level up process?
[2:53:48] <Xelgus> level 3 is subclasses
[2:53:51] <+Rofiarf> i think it is just be missing
[2:53:53] <%chiazam> I'm calling BUG
[2:53:55] <+luftraumm1> weird
[2:53:55] <asurite_warrior> I dont think levels take hold till a long rest!
[2:53:56] <%heartlesshealer> weird
[2:53:57] <+MisterMusashi> If she has Great WEapon that'll work
[2:53:58] <SolsticeZro> Yeah you can go weapon master and specialize on 4 weapons of choice but I think you lock yourself in on those then
[2:54:03] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt the interface is just early accsess
[2:54:08] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt the features should be working, but they dont update on the sheet every time
[2:54:12] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt it MIGHT update on save/sleep
[2:54:25] <%thelaxinator> It's not like he'd sleep
[2:54:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He doesn't sleep, he just fucks around
[2:54:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Vampire shit
[2:54:28] <%Nekros4442> Son ofa bitch Asterion
[2:54:30] <$Dakuu75> btw, is this beta or is theg ame out now?
[2:54:31] <Macfine> just vampire stuff
[2:54:36] <+HelloImTom08> sneaky bitch
[2:54:40] <%TheFabledAble> @SolsticeZro weapon master is useless on a fighter though because they already have proficiency in every weapon
[2:54:44] <%thelaxinator> it must be really boring to never sleep. Real productive though
[2:54:45] <+MisterMusashi> right click on it
[2:54:50] <+MisterMusashi> right click the body
[2:54:51] <%chiazam> time to go
[2:54:53] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> @SolsticeZro Don't think that's necessary since that only gives proficiency. Fighters already get all weapon proficiencies
[2:54:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> early access
[2:54:55] <therakishsage> Early Access, only act 1 of the game is out and it's still pretty rough. @Dakuu75
[2:54:57] <+MisterMusashi> DAMN
[2:55:01] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt you move the body like the vases/chests
[2:55:04] <%Nekros4442> @Dakuu75 It's early access like every other Larian game
[2:55:05] <%reinbachthe3rd> lol
[2:55:07] <%cvp5127> mmmmmm
[2:55:08] <%heartlesshealer> bodies turn into chests basically, at the moment
[2:55:09] <Dellago> Its funny, normal Elves dont sleep either. So Astarion isnt losing out on anything really
[2:55:10] <+tinypouf> you againnnHJnNNNnn
[2:55:14] <+MisterMusashi> Damn
[2:55:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ditch vamp for wizard
[2:55:15] <%BinaryFireball> but he's your asshole
[2:55:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Please make everyone an asshole, I NEED the antagonism
[2:55:20] <@SoFarFetched> Pat didn't even wanna have the c onversationg LUL
[2:55:22] <$Afterman_> you can move though
[2:55:29] <Woronov> @PatStaresAt pat since u love CRPGS did you play the finished state of Pathfinder: Kingmaker? Its the best CRPG out there
[2:55:31] <stabbityrabbit> Astarion goddamn.
[2:55:31] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt damn i was wrong, apologies
[2:55:34] <%aslfrasle> Is this Aloth 2.0
[2:55:35] <+FoolsArcade> Really? I love Gale
[2:55:37] <%Axellogic> I cant believe Pat is gonna kill the wizard
[2:55:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> but he's so much smarter than you are
[2:55:42] <%Saltmeisterr> damn
[2:55:42] <+tinypouf> astarion is bae
[2:55:43] <%heartlesshealer> only ONE spellcaster, and that's Pat
[2:55:43] <$Afterman_> its very good now a days pat
[2:55:46] <+luftraumm1> pat did they implement any form of save scum difficulty?
[2:55:47] <$Afterman_> give pathfinder kingmaker a try
[2:55:51] <+MisterMusashi> Kingmaker had a rough start
[2:55:51] <%Meekest> Pat loves bitchy girls and hates bitchy men
[2:55:56] <%SirGO0SE> wow classist much
[2:55:57] <+stray_blues> That sounds like Pathfinder lol
[2:55:58] <%chiazam> 2
[2:55:58] <@SoFarFetched> It sounds like a love/hate sort of thing with pathfinder
[2:56:00] <QuipSan> 2
[2:56:02] <+lordericter> clerics don't count
[2:56:02] <+luftraumm1> pathfinder is great, better now
[2:56:03] <%linSP> hi gang did we just start
[2:56:04] <therakishsage> It's pretty good, but rough and unbalanced is about right. @PatStaresAt
[2:56:06] <+trigglypuf> I don’t think he’s bad but he’s definitely the weakest of the cast so far
[2:56:06] <jpereta> yes, to all you said about pathfinder
[2:56:07] <Woronov> @PatStaresAt yes it was very unstable they patched the shoit out of it
[2:56:07] <+Rofiarf> it seemed stable when i played it, not sure about balance cause i suck.
[2:56:07] <$Afterman_> the devs have been updating kingmaker quite a lot lately, its vastly improved to how it was.
[2:56:08] <Big_Dream> warlocks are spellcasters
[2:56:09] <caranteen> It was Bugfinder at the start
[2:56:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You should keep the Wizard around just to make him hate you
[2:56:09] <%Calek> pathfinder kingmaker gave me massive choice paralysis once you actually get the kingdom
[2:56:10] <@commanderclaw> You either love it or hate it
[2:56:10] <Siebersboy> pathfinder doesnt work if its not turn based
[2:56:13] <Badgerconda_> Kingmaker has janky issues, but despite them it is fucking amazing and NEEDS to be played by people that are fans of oldschool crpgs.
[2:56:18] <%heartlesshealer> oh I thought shadowheart was someone else. My mistake
[2:56:18] <BedHome> @linSP nah its been going a while
[2:56:19] <Decarcassor> Wizards are arguably the best class in the game. And currently they are super bugged. They can learn any scroll from any class. Its busted :p
[2:56:20] <%chiazam> Where haven't you been?
[2:56:20] <+stray_blues> The game is WAY better than it was at launch. Tons of QoL improvements and bugfixes
[2:56:22] <%SirGO0SE> @linSP been on for a bit
[2:56:24] <BedHome> since 3 est i think
[2:56:27] <+triloq> need druid class plz
[2:56:32] <%BoxNavy> fort joy clintHYPERS
[2:56:37] <+maximumcrit> fort joy was so arse
[2:56:38] <SolsticeZro> Yeah there is another area aside from this first map that is available in EA
[2:56:39] <Woronov> @Siebersboy they added turn based mode
[2:56:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> No Wild Shape for you
[2:56:46] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt press "~"
[2:56:52] <%thelaxinator> crackling with sexual energy
[2:56:55] <+MisterMusashi> Kingmaker improved dramatically, but the class/level system is super complicated compared to this D&D 5e stuff
[2:56:57] <%Nekros4442> I wouldnt be surprised if Druids are the next class added
[2:56:59] <Ipsenscastle> what was wrong with fort joy?
[2:57:02] <+luftraumm1> I've been considering replying kingmaker
[2:57:06] <%heartlesshealer> psaGib <3
[2:57:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sexual hate energy
[2:57:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> press swinton
[2:57:11] <%thelaxinator> Fort Joy lasts about 60% too long
[2:57:19] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt if you accidently turn on "tactical" overview hit "o"
[2:57:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> FART JOY
[2:57:20] <SolsticeZro> Fort Joy seemed too short
[2:57:26] <%thelaxinator> takes too long to get to source magic too
[2:57:30] <tanarath> NWN's main campaign was ass… but there is STILL content coming for NWN.
[2:57:33] <SolsticeZro> I found it too short
[2:57:35] <BedHome> FORT JOY IS TOO MUCH AND ALSO REALLY BORING AND BLAND. IT FEELS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE JUST THAT FOR THE FULL GAME
[2:57:40] <+kawachipto> I quit after beating fort joy
[2:57:42] <%Meekest> Fort Joy makes me not wanna play Divinity 2
[2:57:43] <%thelaxinator> Tutorial area shouldn't be 10 hours long and take up 33% of the game
[2:57:45] <$Caped_Eggy> I love fort joy
[2:57:48] <+encrouched> yay
[2:57:52] <$Caped_Eggy> I was fun to explore
[2:57:55] <tanarath> In the end, mod support made nwn amazing.
[2:57:55] <$Caped_Eggy> it*
[2:57:56] <+tinypouf> fort sad
[2:57:58] <koffeemancer> Fort joy is like 8 hrs or something ye
[2:58:08] <StromkoPenguin> I got to the swamps and the enemies are too tough so I'm stuck. :D
[2:58:09] <cherrycottontail> NWN peaked at that rogue sex campaign
[2:58:09] <SolsticeZro> It's just boring LUL
[2:58:11] <BedHome> fort joy isnt fun enough to be as long as it is
[2:58:13] <%blitzrush1200> I thought Fort Joy was okay, but it is kinda bland
[2:58:15] <%TheFabledAble> YUP
[2:58:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dammit I knew you'd say Peragus
[2:58:19] <cryall> bruh, I love peragus
[2:58:19] <%SirGO0SE> easily
[2:58:19] <$Afterman_> Pat you definitely would love kingmaker
[2:58:27] <%Meekest> Yeah thats about right
[2:58:31] <+Rofiarf> i do like the atmosphere of peragus
[2:58:33] <+luftraumm1> fallout 3 is not great too
[2:58:34] <+Rofiarf> but yeah
[2:58:34] <tattleworm> eh, peragus is fine your first time through, it only sucks on replay
[2:58:36] <%thelaxinator> The Source Collar restriction makes Fort Joy worse
[2:58:36] <SolsticeZro> Faerun has a nice sub section that allows for some extra diversity
[2:58:38] <%W1nterTitan> There's even a mod to skip it
[2:58:39] <jorniev> yeaaah
[2:58:39] <+maximumcrit> good call paragus is awful and almost makes me never wanna play kotor 2 again
[2:58:43] <%thelaxinator> Just locking off an entire mechanic
[2:58:44] <%chiazam> Wait kotor 1 or 2?
[2:58:45] <$joylent_blue> blowing it up was nice at least
[2:58:45] <+MisterMusashi> Oh yeeaaah, that place felt dismal
[2:58:45] <+trigglypuf> Yeah everytime I think about booting it up a new game I remember that I have to suffer through fort joy
[2:58:46] <%CygnusRoboticus> I love peragus
[2:58:53] <risenlp2> Githzerai are just Ugly elves, change my mind.
[2:58:55] <BedHome> ive never played kingmaker but i would LOVE to watch pat play kingmaker
[2:58:55] <%vaporousTippler> The worst tutorial level is any that you play a hundred times while trying different characters.
[2:59:00] <happyfacespam> Peragus is just sooo long, and so much passive aggressive banter
[2:59:00] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt np <3
[2:59:01] <tanarath> @chiazam 2
[2:59:02] <%chiazam> Actually the tutorial level is the mining area
[2:59:03] <+KatanaMancer> no shut up peragus is alright
[2:59:04] <%CygnusRoboticus> it feels like if deadspace was an RPGZ
[2:59:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Womp womp woooomp
[2:59:22] <%chiazam> Now jump
[2:59:24] <%nmaten> this game looks fantastic
[2:59:27] <%heartlesshealer> 🎺🎺
[2:59:27] <SolsticeZro> Pat shove the frog woman down that cliff
[2:59:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> I mean you literally work for the bad guys of this game
[2:59:34] <%blitzrush1200> Try being a Drow, all anyone says is how you like murder
[2:59:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> "great old ones"
[2:59:38] <%reinbachthe3rd> YEET

[2:59:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> whats his patron?
[2:59:46] <%BinaryFireball> push
[2:59:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like Peragus for story reasons, but I can agree that it's too tedious for its own good
[2:59:49] <%CygnusRoboticus> fictional racism is awesome
[2:59:50] <%heartlesshealer> invisible wall
[2:59:51] <%BinaryFireball> push one character off cliff
[2:59:53] <@commanderclaw> @cobalt_phoenix_ Great Old One
[2:59:57] <+pectusumbra> You are literally in league with things from The Far Realms. People would literally crucify you if they found out
[2:59:59] <%thelaxinator> "Not Enough Space" seems to be code for "this isn't real land"
[3:00:01] <SolsticeZro> do it
[3:00:02] <%SilverKryscent> he's GOOlock
[3:00:02] <%BinaryFireball> yessssssssss

[3:00:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @commanderclaw thx
[3:00:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Fey is a different type of warlock
[3:00:08] <%Nekros4442> I wana go Lolth-sword Drow and just kill everyone I see

[3:00:55] <%thelaxinator> he had an arrow in his back
[3:00:58] <%VashyronM> there is no where to land there. you can shove creatures off cliffs provided they have somewhere to land

[3:02:31] <chai_wolf> streams fine for me
[3:02:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Cheer500 Fun fact this game is an unofficial sequel to a recent adventure module were the city of Elturel gets sucked into hell.
[3:02:31] <jorniev> FAWKING GAWWWBLINS
[3:02:34] <%Rakenshin> Pat likes the lady Gith for the same reason he likes Asuka: bad taste
[3:02:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> sbfpLiam sbfpLiam sbfpLiam
[3:02:35] <TheAdMerlin> Goblin's weren't a Player Race in the PHB for 5e so they won't be a playable race
[3:02:38] <%Bailey__gaming> bugbears are great
[3:02:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> bugbear chan
[3:02:41] <%heartlesshealer> bugbears <3
[3:02:42] <%TheFabledAble> WELP
[3:02:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Time to pay tf up
[3:02:45] <%thelaxinator> Not as cool as an owlbear
[3:02:45] <SolsticeZro> Influenced
[3:02:49] <%vaporousTippler> That's a 60 dollar bugbear.
[3:02:50] <%Saltmeisterr> wtf is a bug bear?
[3:02:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> What the fuck is a Bug Bear?
[3:02:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> all the goblins looking like Raditz with their hairstyles
[3:02:56] <KruelDestiny> Can you right click and examine? 🤔
[3:02:56] <+fingalights> That there be a bug bear right there
[3:02:58] <%chiazam> SAVED
[3:02:58] <Jonny_Uppercut> Bugbears are good people
[3:03:00] <%aslfrasle> Klarg the BugBear!
[3:03:04] <Macfine> A bugbear is a big goblin
[3:03:05] <%Treuan> It's a bug! It's a bear!
[3:03:06] <%heartlesshealer> a bugbear is a tall, hot goblinoid
[3:03:06] <+dmtjinni> PATO
[3:03:11] <SolsticeZro> There is a funny scene with two bugbears later in the game
[3:03:11] <Macfine> with monkey arms
[3:03:15] <risenlp2> @Saltmeisterr A bigger, furrier, more militarily minded version of a goblin
[3:03:16] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Be careful of Bugbears they do an extra die of damage on their attacks
[3:03:18] <Decarcassor> Also goblinoids in general are not accepted in most civilized places of the sword coast.
[3:03:18] <+lethallylactic> @StrawberryPantsu It's like a hobgoblin, but fuzzy and sneaky.
[3:03:21] <%Bailey__gaming> im hearing the singing as "Goblins, lots of goblins"
[3:03:24] <%thelaxinator> Hex the bugbears int, see if he notices
[3:03:30] <Jonny_Uppercut> @StrawberryPantsu Basically a giant hairy savage goblin with long arms
[3:03:36] <+Dova573> hellish rebuke their asses
[3:03:38] <chai_wolf> I had a Yorkie named Katie I used to call my little bugbear 🤣
[3:03:45] <+Exicuren> oooffff like 60% health
[3:03:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what is that big dog thing
[3:03:52] <%thelaxinator> seems like a designed loss
[3:03:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> @lethallylactic & @Jonny_Uppercut thanks
[3:03:57] <%Calek> worg
[3:03:59] <%blitzrush1200> I doubt you can save the archer, they always kill her first
[3:04:03] <Macfine> the big dog is a "Worg"
[3:04:05] <%Rakenshin> HOLY
[3:04:06] <%thelaxinator> SICK
[3:04:09] <+Jaromero435> Wyll PogChamp
[3:04:11] <%chiazam> WHAT A BADASS
[3:04:13] <+Politepies> FART HORN
[3:04:14] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt He cast Featherfall in advance
[3:04:14] <+luftraumm1> should have hexed the gob boss
[3:04:15] <+Brosevelt> how the hell did he do that LOL
[3:04:16] <%Broand> wyll you believe it
[3:04:17] <+gnoame> They'll save themselves, or die trying
[3:04:18] <BedHome> FEATHER FAAAAl
[3:04:18] <%Bt_Robot> HE WOULD BE DEAD IN d&d
[3:04:18] <KruelDestiny> PogChamp that's the hero of the story
[3:04:18] <+akaoridux> WYLL PogChamp
[3:04:18] <+kilnclayborn> What a hero PogChamp
[3:04:18] <%blitzrush1200> Yeab no fall damage
[3:04:21] <TheLeadingTone> feather fall is sick
[3:04:25] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> out of range
[3:04:27] <SolsticeZro> Feather Fall
[3:04:33] <+KatanaMancer> WYLL MAH MOI
[3:04:36] <%linSP> there’s a guy up there
[3:04:44] <+KatanaMancer> boi ok
[3:04:44] <%chiazam> DASH
[3:04:54] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt hellish rebuke is short ranged, you needed to be closer
[3:04:58] <+OtakuBeat> @PatStaresAt would you recommend getting BG3 now, or wait for some patches?
[3:05:01] <jorniev> dash
[3:05:03] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt The guy that jumped cast Feather Fall
[3:05:03] <%Rakenshin> I say send Patron up there to kill that gobbo and get height advantage
[3:05:10] <jorniev> DASH MAN
[3:05:10] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt yea hellish rebuke needs to be fixed BADLY. its currently a projectile so if an enemy hits you but the pathing is blocked the projectile wont hit them at ALL
[3:05:22] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Also question do you meet Gale
[3:05:26] <St_Burke> NoOooOOooOOo
[3:05:28] <@SoFarFetched> @OtakuBeat should definitely wait since it has quite some bug issues.Especially for an early access game at 60 bucks
[3:05:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Just like in real dnd the Rogue went to far ahead
[3:05:38] <BedHome> oh i was wrong about hellish rebuke that sucks @TheFabledAble
[3:05:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yesss my chicken sandwich is here
[3:05:45] <+luftraumm1> I'm actually going to wait for the full release, none of my favourite classes or races are in yet
[3:05:48] <StromkoPenguin> @MonsterEnvy He had Gale in the party, he left him in camp for Lae'zal
[3:05:49] <risenlp2> is the doggo a bearbug? :)
[3:05:58] <+OtakuBeat> @SoFarFetched Thanks, I will do that then
[3:05:58] <%chiazam> EXTRA ACTION
[3:05:59] <+Rofiarf> second action
[3:06:01] <zecht89> gives you another action
[3:06:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it's Haste for one turn
[3:06:03] <+MisterMusashi> action surge is insane
[3:06:03] <QuipSan> extra action
[3:06:04] <%heartlesshealer> dog is worg
[3:06:04] <%Bt_Robot> EXTRA ATTCK PER TURN
[3:06:04] <%Jekado> action surge is an extra action
[3:06:04] <SolsticeZro> Let's you act more times
[3:06:07] <risenlp2> @PatStaresAt If Action surge is like 5e D&D. it's an extra action.
[3:06:08] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Action surge is a fighter ability that lets them take another action
[3:06:08] <%thelaxinator> He popped inner release
[3:06:09] <%VashyronM> action surge gives a second action
[3:06:22] <+luftraumm1> lots dex
[3:06:22] <+KatanaMancer> dude disengage first
[3:06:23] <+XxBTExX> "threatened"
[3:06:27] <zecht89> is it me or do warlocks suck?
[3:06:28] <%heartlesshealer> armor class, yo
[3:06:30] <%Saltmeisterr> thats xcom baby
[3:06:30] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt disadvantage using ranged attacks in melee
[3:06:36] <Decarcassor> Using a ranged attack in melee give yu disadvantage
[3:06:37] <$RealThiele> dialtone?!
[3:06:38] <+KatanaMancer> jump then shoot
[3:06:39] <%thelaxinator> local warlock takes 2 damage and then flees
[3:06:40] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt when you target something you can look at the percentage in the center left to see why the percentage is lower than normal
[3:06:43] <SolsticeZro> attack of opportunity
[3:06:47] <%heartlesshealer> warlocks suck at close range
[3:06:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> @zecht89 Its you
[3:06:52] <+luftraumm1> warlocks are hard early game
[3:06:53] <%heartlesshealer> otherwise good
[3:06:54] <asurite_warrior> Are the dice fair in this game?
[3:06:57] <BedHome> and disadvantage is -50% to hit, effectivly
[3:07:02] <%thelaxinator> There's so many misses at level 1. it's like a slap fight
[3:07:05] <%MonsterEnvy> He could not sneak attack cause he had no allies close
[3:07:08] <+MisterMusashi> Action Surge is normally once per Short/Long Rest, but BG3 it's once per combat, and it's absurd but feels way better.
[3:07:10] <%Jekado> you can't sneak attack if they are not flanked right?
[3:07:26] <%TheFabledAble> @BedHome it works great if theres nothing in the way, but with how much clutter there is in the game its very unpredictable.... they need to change it to act like sacred flame.
[3:07:33] <SolsticeZro> Fighters seem busted
[3:07:34] <%VashyronM> @zecht89 warlocks are pretty good. close range is bad for them, but recovering spell slots after a short rest and a cantrip that does 1d10 is pretty good
[3:07:35] <%Jekado> sneak attack in this is what flatfooted or flanked?
[3:07:35] <+Brosevelt> she rules
[3:07:43] <%TheFabledAble> by that I mean its an on target effect not a projectile
[3:07:49] <%chiazam> Shove it off
[3:07:50] <BedHome> @Jekado you can sneak attack whenever you have advantage, which is pretty easy to get in multiple ways, i think
[3:07:52] <+gnoame> kick him off
[3:07:53] <dabeaminator> This Twitch extension is wild
[3:07:55] <+akaoridux> SHOVE
[3:07:56] <%thelaxinator> Fighters are good at fighting, who would've guessed
[3:08:07] <%ShogunNoonto> pycvh
[3:08:13] <+luftraumm1> lv1 is funny because all of the misses
[3:08:14] <%heartlesshealer> rip
[3:08:20] <+Arkfyre> Fighters aren't flashy but they do their job very well.
[3:08:21] <Timurine> is there a teleport skill?
[3:08:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes
[3:08:32] <BedHome> telaport is later game
[3:08:38] <%linSP> pats still level 1?
[3:08:41] <%VashyronM> misty step
[3:08:42] <+MisterMusashi> There is an event history panel in the bottom right the game never tells you about
[3:08:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Imagine PvP with this setup
[3:08:43] <BedHome> there are small telaports you can get sooner for some classes
[3:08:47] <BedHome> level 2
[3:08:56] <%TheFabledAble> @Timurine there is, its called misty step, and pat can get it at lvl 3
[3:08:58] <SolsticeZro> Misty Step yeah but it's not like Teleport in OS
[3:08:59] <%DedlokPM> @linSP level 2
[3:09:00] <stabbityrabbit> Yeah, Fighters are in a perfect place in 5e. They might not have the burst damage, or insane resistance of other melees, but they're the best at consistency.
[3:09:05] <%heartlesshealer> help vampire
[3:09:10] <Timurine> nice
[3:09:24] <BedHome> @GarbageQueenEllie larians last game that was basically this, divinity origional sin 2, had player vs player combat
[3:09:24] <stabbityrabbit> Which I think is fitting considering their whole thing is that they just have a bunch of training.
[3:09:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> YES
[3:09:25] <St_Burke> he ate shit
[3:09:25] <%Rakenshin> Woot
[3:09:27] <+gnoame> yeah
[3:09:29] <%heartlesshealer> YEET
[3:09:29] <+Arkfyre> LUL
[3:09:30] <+akaoridux> YEAH
[3:09:31] <snaggletusks> nice!!
[3:09:31] <%Pappajimbo> eat shit
[3:09:32] <%vaporousTippler> We Tekken now.
[3:09:35] <%Bt_Robot> HEEL

[3:09:40] <tanarath> YEEEEET
[3:09:43] <+Brosevelt> dunked
[3:09:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @BedHome wow
[3:09:51] <@commanderclaw> It sounds like she yells "NINTENDO" when she uses sacred flame
[3:10:02] <+luftraumm1> dash
[3:10:03] <Decarcassor> Wait Will is supposed to be here ?
[3:10:08] <@SoFarFetched> she's still mad when she never got her nintendo that one time
[3:10:10] <+dmtjinni> PATO2000
[3:10:10] <%thelaxinator> @commanderclaw and Eldritch blast sounds like "JOHNS!"
[3:10:17] <+gnoame> Well he did take it
[3:10:21] <Decarcassor> I never saw him. Maybe he died in my game and I never noticed. :D
[3:10:23] <BedHome> @GarbageQueenEllie if this doesnt have pvp you can either play Divinity Origional Sin 2 or wait for the eventual pvp mod for this as it has multiplayer
[3:10:28] <+akaoridux> pat's character has contributed nothing this fight lol
[3:10:28] <Marden2> watch out for that bear, you know what i mean?
[3:10:39] <happyfacespam> gobolinos
[3:10:39] <%heartlesshealer> now have her stab the hot bugbear
[3:11:04] <%thelaxinator> This game has the most aggressive looking healing spells I've ever seen
[3:11:06] <%Broand> you know, that vampire seems pretty okay with being healed with magic, so I'm not sure if he IS a vampire
[3:11:18] <Anr1ck> Pats charactwr should just stay at higher ground and spam eldritch blast in hexed enemies
[3:11:24] <BedHome> @Broand thats not a thing in 5e iirc
[3:11:26] <%Rakenshin> Patron hasn't hit a single guy I think
[3:11:27] <Marden2> xcom vibes
[3:11:28] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:11:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> but that ass just wont quit

[3:12:02] <Decarcassor> Also, try crossing running water with Astarion. Its fun.
[3:12:04] <%Broand> he fell down
[3:12:07] <St_Burke> not addative

[3:12:58] <+Pookiedaexzile> they knew
[3:12:59] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT HIGHER GROUND! it would give you advantage, which is plus 50% to hit if you dont already have it, and cancels out disadvantage which is -50% to hit
[3:13:08] <%Broand> I feel like starting afresh in kingmaker or something
[3:13:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> is there anyway we can side wit hthe goblins
[3:13:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo nice

[3:13:53] <KaiserMario> Why not a mediocre character?
[3:13:54] <risenlp2> Pat says that but he made a warlock. Kappa
[3:13:54] <+MephioTV> making a bad character is very hard to do in 5e, like you have to try real hard to
[3:14:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> yeyeye fight over that blue Tiefling diiiyack
[3:14:02] <Macfine> @BedHome advantage isnt +50%, it works out to +5 on average..which is roughly 25% more
[3:14:02] <%thelaxinator> did that corpse just tell you not to get handsy?
[3:14:04] <+luftraumm1> there lots and lots of resources
[3:14:07] <%heartlesshealer> ....
[3:14:07] <+PenmanLupine> do modern games even let you screw yourself like old baldurs gate anymore?
[3:14:09] <%Jekado> Isn't that paige job?
[3:14:12] <%Broand> I was just offhandedly mentioning it, they added a turn based mode to kingmaker recently
[3:14:13] <@commanderclaw> Oh no, the goblin boss has magic gloves!
[3:14:15] <princegeo> fextra got good guides

[3:14:30] <%cylish> Those are not great
[3:14:31] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt the gloves are cursed read them closely
[3:14:31] <%heartlesshealer> so the gate closed
[3:14:35] <+luftraumm1> poggin
[3:14:37] <Anr1ck> You cant use it
[3:14:41] <+maximumcrit> those gloves are a trap pat, they also cause bane on you lol
[3:14:41] <%chiazam> great axe great axe
[3:14:44] <Man_in_the_Red> @penmanlupine thr only one i can think of is Pathologic 2 but the game is advertised as suffering
[3:14:50] <%Broand> It's not just a good axe!
[3:14:50] <+Rofiarf> the gloves are not good
[3:14:51] <+shabop> its great
[3:14:51] <%heartlesshealer> hmmmm
[3:14:51] <Decarcassor> The Axe is good for Lae'zel.
[3:14:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She does have a great ass- oh you said axe.
[3:14:56] <+xiccy> just play a kineticist in kingmaker. it's a shitty class on tabletop but it's great in kingmaker
[3:14:58] <Man_in_the_Red> its amazing
[3:15:02] <+TheWarpJump> They are bad lol read it
[3:15:12] <Anr1ck> only drow can use it right
[3:15:13] <%Bt_Robot> WARLOCK NEED
[3:15:19] <@commanderclaw> I can't believe they give you a cursed item so early
[3:15:23] <%heartlesshealer> you need to know who worships what
[3:15:24] <%chiazam> d12
[3:15:26] <QuipSan> big damage
[3:15:28] <Decarcassor> Itw way better
[3:15:28] <%MonsterEnvy> 1d12 vs 1d8 it's better
[3:15:28] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt There are a huge amount of optimization guides for every Pathfinder class. I would look one up for whatever class you want to play, and follow it pretty closely.
[3:15:28] <%Calek> it's better 1d12 compared to 1d8
[3:15:29] <+FoolsArcade> Don't use the gloves of power
[3:15:30] <Big_Dream> cleave is very good\
[3:15:34] <%Broand> So don't wear those gauntlets I guess
[3:15:35] <%chiazam> Big Number
[3:15:37] <lord_sykos> its a d12 vs a d8, no contest
[3:15:38] <+Rofiarf> is 2d6 better or worse then 1d12?
[3:15:39] <stabbityrabbit> However I also think Kingmaker sucks.
[3:15:39] <+FoolsArcade> Gloves of power is a trap
[3:15:42] <%Pappajimbo> non magig but better standard damage
[3:15:45] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt a greatsword would be better than both ultimately
[3:15:46] <Big_Dream> cleave is very good
[3:15:55] <%Calek> @Rofiarf the never ending debate
[3:16:00] <heartlesshealer> did you loot puppy?
[3:16:03] <Macfine> @Rofiarf on average the 2d6 is better
[3:16:04] <%TheFabledAble> @Rofiarf its better because great weapon master procs off both dice of the 2d6
[3:16:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Invisiblessed
[3:16:15] <+Rofiarf> oh thanks
[3:16:19] <%Jekado> @Rofiarf 2d6 is more consistent damage if actually real rolls

[3:16:30] <%Meekest> Do it
[3:16:31] <+VERDAXY> THOTS
[3:16:34] <%DedlokPM> Detect THOTs?
[3:16:34] <%SirGO0SE> i used detect thoughts on Pat and got an error
[3:16:35] <Anr1ck> get misty step
[3:16:35] <%heartlesshealer> mirror image is silly
[3:16:38] <%chiazam> SPELLS
[3:16:40] <+professormorrigan> is mind reading implemented
[3:16:43] <jpereta> hold person is super good
[3:16:43] <Doomstar16> Heh heh
[3:16:44] <Darren716> Personally i find it easy to detect thots unaided
[3:16:45] <+Brosevelt> hold person guarantees a critical hit on the target for any melee attacks, just fyi
[3:16:46] <QuipSan> misty step is good
[3:16:49] <+professormorrigan> how does it work
[3:16:51] <%heartlesshealer> Shatter is when you need to BREAK SHIT
[3:16:51] <tanarath> Detect the thots, Pat
[3:16:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Short range teleport
[3:16:52] <Big_Dream> @PatStaresAt misty is a raction
[3:16:53] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt i @ed you a guide for pathfinder kingmaker on twitter. so long as you pump the stats it reccomends for your class, you should be okay
[3:16:55] <Anr1ck> Misty step is the best
[3:16:56] <+DartonLance> I don't know if they fixed the bug but eldritch blast on warlocks triggers weapon on hit effects if you use the spear on one
[3:16:56] <+maximumcrit> misty step is amazing for positioning
[3:16:56] <+FoolsArcade> Arms of Hadar!
[3:16:58] <Big_Dream> @PatStaresAt misty is a reaction
[3:17:01] <stabbityrabbit> @Rofiarf There's one specific build where 1d12 is better. Crit-Fishing. For pretty much everything else you want 2d6 instead.
[3:17:01] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt high ground gives you advantage which is huge, misty step lets you instantly achieve it
[3:17:03] <digital_gambitt> Misty is a bonus action too.
[3:17:06] <%thelaxinator> Shatter but no heat metal?
[3:17:06] <%chiazam> detect thoughts

[3:20:19] <%Ne1son> No level 3
[3:20:21] <+pectusumbra> pact of the chain. The pacts are separate parts of your warlock abilities
[3:20:21] <brutalgenie> @patstaresat If you love crpgs you really should play pathfinder kingmaker
[3:20:21] <+MisterMusashi> I want a Pseudodragon or a Tressym uniiREEEE
[3:20:22] <jorniev> HEY MINI PAT
[3:20:25] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt it should have been an option on level up, PACT OF CHAIN gets familiar
[3:20:25] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt no at lvl 3 you get a feature called pact of the chain that is a bonus for your warlock pact
[3:20:27] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> class options
[3:20:28] <%Taisuru> CRAAAAAB
[3:20:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> PAT OF THE HEXBLADE
[3:20:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> HEXBLADE
[3:20:30] <+pectusumbra> For level 3
[3:20:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> fuck these fools
[3:20:34] <@commanderclaw> You passed by it
[3:20:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> pact not patron
[3:20:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> I leave for five seconds
[3:20:42] <+RAH001> that looked like the litle guy u summon in divinity os2
[3:20:43] <Decarcassor> Hexblade isnt in the game
[3:20:49] <Goodvibes99508> lv3 warlock
[3:20:50] <%heartlesshealer> Old One is your source of power, Pact of Chain is your version of power
[3:20:51] <Xelgus> I don't think other pacts are an option yet? not that I saw
[3:20:51] <+KatanaMancer> there is no hexblade
[3:20:52] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Pact of the Omnieye
[3:20:52] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt IT SHOULD be a choice under lvl 3 ITS POSSIBLE that chain is the only option in the game right now
[3:20:57] <Eltruis> the only pact so far is chain
[3:20:57] <%JohnAtDawn> No Hexblade? 0/10
[3:21:00] <jorniev> why is hexblade not in ?
[3:21:03] <%heartlesshealer> psaGib
[3:21:03] <QuipSan> its like another subclass
[3:21:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> God damn it not Hexbalde
[3:21:05] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can freely move your familair and move themaround have them scout and stuff.
[3:21:08] <+pectusumbra> Seems like it's just auto in the game for now because it's the only choice for early access
[3:21:12] <tanarath> eR
[3:21:13] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt basically it gives you find familiar with the unique bonus to summon an imp which is amazing
[3:21:14] <+Mottyrob> Here's hoping you don't turn into a squid
[3:21:20] <tanarath> early betA?
[3:21:20] <HarmlessCrow> Yeah just chain hoped you wanted to be a summoner class Kappa
[3:21:21] <SomeAsianDood> No hexblade no buy DansGame
[3:21:21] <Big_Dream> the game is not finished chat
[3:21:26] <%TheFabledAble> EARLY ACCESS GUYS THERE WILL BE MORE CLASS OPTIONS GEEEEEZE
[3:21:27] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt it might force you to take pact of the chain for familiar if there is no other option a WARLOCK PACT is basically a SUBCLASS
[3:21:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaBlep
[3:21:28] <Big_Dream> thats why no hexblade
[3:21:38] <Decarcassor> @jorniev because its early acces and still missing half of the classes and some races
[3:21:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> No Hexblade No Money
[3:21:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> Why is Pat blue?
[3:21:43] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, no other choices in EA
[3:21:49] <%VashyronM> I doubt hexblade will make it in tho.
[3:21:50] <tanarath> needs more tome
[3:21:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Game is bad now
[3:21:55] <%Calek> hopefully hexblade makes it in
[3:21:57] <%heartlesshealer> choices later
[3:21:59] <St_Burke> Most things that arent PHB DMG or MM are not in the game
[3:22:06] <St_Burke> yet
[3:22:06] <+Brosevelt> basically, warlock has three "pact choices" which are essentially subclasses: chain, blade, and tome
[3:22:07] <%MonsterEnvy> Check out his abilites
[3:22:07] <prime_name> Have they said what other races will be coming?
[3:22:09] <%Ne1son> Boo hexblade
[3:22:09] <%chiazam> What can IMP do?
[3:22:11] <BedHome> @TheFabledAble if they dont tell you when theres less choices than there should be, you are going to assume that the 5e base options are there
[3:22:12] <%heartlesshealer> so that imp has a fly speed
[3:22:13] <+pectusumbra> In 5e the base Pacts are Blade, Book, and Chain. Blade lets you summon magic weapons, Book gives you extra cantrips and ritual spells, Chain gives you the best familiars any casters have
[3:22:14] <%MonsterEnvy> the imp can fly and stuff
[3:22:17] <%heartlesshealer> make it race up the cliff
[3:22:22] <%Calek> and more prepared spell slots!
[3:22:27] <%thelaxinator> She just gets every spell doesn't she
[3:22:41] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt PASS WITHOUT TRACE IS SUPER STEALTH
[3:22:43] <Aydarkzero> weird
[3:22:43] <+Brosevelt> clerics OP, bless
[3:22:50] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt Once they put it in the game you'll have a choice between either getting more spells, or getting a fancy weapon. There's merits to all of them. Even if the merit to Blade Pact is just that it seems cool.
[3:22:50] <Dellago> Clerics have to prepare a certain amount of them per day
[3:22:53] <%heartlesshealer> they get everything, but you have to choose daily spells
[3:22:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> lesser resporation is good
[3:22:56] <%aslfrasle> Hexblade isn't a pact though, it's its own patron, and this seems to be focusing on PHB stuff according to the wiki.
[3:22:58] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt grab healing and then whatevers cool
[3:22:58] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt you can change cleric spells any time outside of combat
[3:23:00] <Big_Dream> is bless an option
[3:23:03] <KruelDestiny> You can't go wrong with bless Pat
[3:23:04] <%Rakenshin> Buffs and then a couple of healing spells
[3:23:05] <Big_Dream> bless is amazing
[3:23:06] <QuipSan> healing word and cure wounds
[3:23:07] <%chiazam> HOLF
[3:23:07] <HarmlessCrow> If they add Hexblade I am very exicted for every high-diffculty build to just run Warlockadin cheese
[3:23:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> Clerics get everything because "Please god play a healer"
[3:23:09] <%TheFabledAble> @BedHome they havent fully implemented base SRD class features yet though so
[3:23:09] <+maximumcrit> bless & heals always helpful
[3:23:09] <%Smeagleman6> It's too bad Shadowheart is a Trickery domain Cleric
[3:23:09] <+lordericter> clerics get everything until level 5 spells then the sorcerers start bending the laws of reality
[3:23:12] <Aydarkzero> i would just give them whatever spells my other characters didn't have
[3:23:15] <Decarcassor> Go for Bless and Healing Word. The rest barely matter :p
[3:23:18] <%Smeagleman6> It makes her so underpowered
[3:23:20] <%chiazam> Hold Person
[3:23:20] <+Brosevelt> Bless is unironically the most value spell in 5th edition
[3:23:22] <Decarcassor> Cure wounds sucks
[3:23:24] <%Rakenshin> Prayer of healing looks good
[3:23:25] <+TheWarpJump> I found create water to be good for freezing
[3:23:26] <%VashyronM> how are they going to handle pact of the tome in this game, I wonder. Ritual spells aren't a thing (yet) and why do you need cantrips other than eldritch blast?
[3:23:30] <+lordericter> just make her a heal slave
[3:23:32] <Macfine> Hold person can trivialize big tough humanoids
[3:23:33] <%Rakenshin> Oh wait, that's out of combat only
[3:23:36] <Big_Dream> get the spell bless it adds a 1d4 tp your attacks
[3:23:36] <%chiazam> Oh you do have Cure Wounds
[3:23:37] <BedHome> @TheFabledAble then there needs to be a pop up saying "hey, eventually, you will have these options"
[3:23:38] <%TheFabledAble> bless is amazing, curewounds is optional. Guiding bolt hits like a TRUCK
[3:23:38] <%Smeagleman6> Cure Wounds and Aid are fantastic
[3:23:40] <%thelaxinator> you just moused over cure wounds
[3:23:50] <@commanderclaw> Cure Wounds is melee and takes an action, healing word takes a bonus at ranged and heals less
[3:23:53] <Decarcassor> Guiding Bolt !
[3:23:54] <QuipSan> prayer of healing is only outside of combat
[3:23:56] <$Bt_Robot> GREEN CROSS IS CURE WOUNDS
[3:23:57] <%SilverKryscent> you can get Shocking Hands with tome, so melee isn't as awful
[3:24:01] <Decarcassor> Cure Wounds is ass. Just don't.
[3:24:04] <tanarath> hold is nice, lesser resto is nice
[3:24:05] <BedHome> @TheFabledAble the options are super available and exist, the rules are there and they can tell you what they will be in a text box
[3:24:08] <%Bt_Robot> ALSO YOU HAVE SIX SLOTS
[3:24:09] <KruelDestiny> hold person
[3:24:09] <HarmlessCrow> Guiding Bolt is how clerics earn their bread until like level 5
[3:24:10] <+FoolsArcade> ALWAYS GUIDING BOLT
[3:24:13] <BedHome> even if they arent in game yet
[3:24:14] <%SilverKryscent> GUIDING BOLT
[3:24:15] <%chiazam> Damage
[3:24:20] <%VashyronM> yeah, that's true
[3:24:20] <smallheals> healing word is the bees knees
[3:24:26] <%chiazam> GUIDING BOLT
[3:24:27] <+pectusumbra> @VashyronM they might roll some xanathar stuff in there as a way to buff it perhaps, like the invocations that make you immune to sleep, or the expanded options that let you help party members with your book
[3:24:27] <+TheWarpJump> guiding bolt
[3:24:27] <%Smeagleman6> Aid is good
[3:24:30] <%linSP> guiding bolt is great
[3:24:32] <HarmlessCrow> Yo does EA have Spiritual Weapon?
[3:24:34] <%TheFabledAble> I think were arguing the same thing xD
[3:24:39] <%Calek> guiding bolt is good
[3:24:44] <Siebersboy> guiding bolt is op
[3:24:45] <%thelaxinator> 4d6? that's a lot of fixed damage
[3:24:46] <Decarcassor> No spiritual Weapon
[3:24:49] <stabbityrabbit> @VashyronM You could pick up Shilleleigh which lets you Blade Pact better than Blade Pact, and gets you a bunch more versatility besides.
[3:24:55] <+Brosevelt> cool thing is guiding bolt gives advantage on the next attack as well
[3:24:58] <%chiazam> SWEET JESUS
[3:24:59] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt guiding bolt is the best dmg spell
[3:25:01] <TheBadonkulator> Expand it with the + sign
[3:25:02] <%aslfrasle> Spiritual Weapon is 3rd level spell
[3:25:09] <QuipSan> you can cast spells at lv2 now
[3:25:10] <%chiazam> CLERICS
[3:25:12] <%thelaxinator> you can expand the bar horizontall
[3:25:13] <+AgniBrandt> Clerics are incredibly strong
[3:25:15] <Xelgus> check your shit with K
[3:25:17] <%VashyronM> @pectusumbra they'd have to do something.
[3:25:18] <%Calek> Spells plus upcasted versions have their own buttons, it's a mess
[3:25:19] <%chiazam> THE A-MEN
[3:25:19] <lord_sykos> some of those are upcasted versions of level 1 spells
[3:25:22] <+TheWarpJump> make the bar bigger
[3:25:24] <+Dova573> mmo level of hotbars
[3:25:25] <%VashyronM> @stabbityrabbit that would be hilarious
[3:25:26] <Macfine> guiding bolt does a lot of damage..because if you miss, that's it, nothing for a spell slot
[3:25:26] <%TheFabledAble> yup
[3:25:27] <Siebersboy> and this is why 5e as a game gets awkward
[3:25:28] <jdanov> i'm getting stressed just looking at that action bar
[3:25:35] <HarmlessCrow> @Decarcassor Spiritual Weapon is my cleric crutch that's pretty sad
[3:25:44] <koffeemancer> You have some dupes in there
[3:25:47] <Kravus> lvl 2 spell slot vs lvl 1 slots
[3:25:48] <ikantreeed> @patstaresat ITS SCARY OUTSIDE HELP BRO
[3:25:49] <Siebersboy> you can cast spells at a higher level yeah
[3:25:51] <QuipSan> yes
[3:25:52] <%Calek> bless 3 people vs 4 people when you upcast
[3:25:53] <MForan98> yeah
[3:25:54] <%thelaxinator> This is starting to look like hotbars in FF14
[3:25:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[3:25:54] <%trustycoyote> do you need boh on the bar?
[3:25:55] <%chiazam> YOU CAN CAST LEVEL 1 SPELLS AS LEVEL 2
[3:25:56] <+artschooltrash> Increases by 1 person
[3:25:56] <KruelDestiny> Some spells you can upcast using a higher level slot
[3:25:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> like how spells work
[3:25:59] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can "upcast" spells which provides some benefits, for bless upcvasting lets it buff more people
[3:26:00] <+FoolsArcade> using a higher spell slot grants stronger spell for certain spells
[3:26:01] <aeonicvector> Upcasting
[3:26:01] <Decarcassor> I'm realizing how unclear some of this stuff is if you don't know the D&D5 rules
[3:26:01] <TheLeadingTone> you can use your first level spells in level 2 slots
[3:26:02] <+Dorf1> the 3e temple of elemental evil had a nice radial menu
[3:26:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> spell slots ye
[3:26:03] <bearking05> no you can cast bless at level 2
[3:26:04] <QuipSan> you have lv1 and lv2 spell slots
[3:26:04] <+pectusumbra> yeah, you can cast spells at higher levels for stronger effects
[3:26:08] <tanarath> higher level = more powerful
[3:26:11] <%aslfrasle> You can cast spells at higher levels for additional strength
[3:26:11] <RedPanda25> Put the cantrips on a different hotbar?
[3:26:12] <+AgniBrandt> You can case most spells at a higher spell slot for added effects
[3:26:14] <%Bt_Robot> YOU CAN CAST SPELLS AT A HIGHER LEVEL FOR BETTER EFFECTS
[3:26:15] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, it's setting up Heightened spells
[3:26:15] <+TheWarpJump> they use diffrent spell slots and are better
[3:26:16] <%Smeagleman6> You can cast low level spells using higher level spell slots, and they usually get stronger @PatStaresAt
[3:26:18] <+Brosevelt> basically, you can use a higher level spell slot to make the spell more potent; sometimes it does more damage, sometimes it targets more things
[3:26:19] <MForan98> spells can be cast in higher spell slots for greater effects in 5e
[3:26:20] <+pectusumbra> it's how they balanced casters a bit more in 5e. Note, A BIT
[3:26:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Here
[3:26:22] <%Pappajimbo> you can use lvl2 twice and level 1 4 times
[3:26:26] <+AgniBrandt> Guiding bolt gets another damage die for instance
[3:26:29] <Xelgus> I would organize by spell slot requirement, so you don't accidentally use a spell slot when a cantrip would do
[3:26:31] <BedHome> @PatStaresAt thanks for the rad stream, i gotta peace out
[3:26:34] <stabbityrabbit> Wow, they need tabs for different spell/ability types.
[3:26:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> sometimes it makes the spell stronger, but not always, at least in dnd
[3:26:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> heres where pat says something like " Why would you ever want to cast it at the lower level"
[3:26:40] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt pass without a trace is AMAZING, gives everyone +10 to stealth
[3:26:44] <%linSP> They should put upcasts in a sub menu like cast familiar
[3:26:59] <%Pappajimbo> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:27:09] <lord_sykos> They need a different system for bars if every level of spells for a single spell takes up a spot on the bar.
[3:27:18] <+Doorjamb13> That spell list is going to get messy if every level of up cast is it's own button
[3:27:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> UI management, what is this an MMO?
[3:27:31] <Siebersboy> yeah this is a mess
[3:27:41] <+XxBTExX> lock the Spellbar
[3:27:42] <+VERDAXY> this need to categorized a bit more on the tab
[3:27:44] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt theres up and down arrows to the right of the spells
[3:27:47] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt pat go to your game options and turn off "auto put spells in hotbar"
[3:27:47] <%emperordread> Protip: Guidance cantrip (Shadowheart) is really good, cast it often on your party leader
[3:28:00] <%thelaxinator> NVN had a better solution for this, but it took a few seconds every turn
[3:28:02] <St_Burke> o is that not what you mean
[3:28:03] <%heartlesshealer> it should be less of a mess on Warlocks, but yeah prepared spellcasters all have this shit
[3:28:04] <dinnydanny777> My head hurts looking at this bar NotLikeThis
[3:28:13] <Decarcassor> Its especially bad with Shadowheath because she get domain spells and channel divinity spell-like abilities.
[3:28:26] <%amonimis> this is why I try not to be a spellcaster in shit like this LUL
[3:28:27] <stabbityrabbit> There needs to be different pages that segment the spell levels and non-spell abilities.
[3:28:29] <dinnydanny777> Do melee fighters have to deal with this?
[3:28:32] <Xelgus> but now "recast" options won't appear
[3:28:37] <St_Burke> LOCK the task-bar. LOCK the task-bar.
[3:28:44] <%chiazam> early accesssssss
[3:28:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> Bruh the way She said speak got me feeling some type of way
[3:28:56] <Macfine> @dinnydanny777 no...Melee fighters do not have to worry about there spells...
[3:29:06] <MForan98> @PatStaresAt They're or You're gonna need to figure something out because just about every spell gets a 9th lv version. That's a lot of fuckin micro my dude
[3:29:21] <dinnydanny777> @macfine Yes but obviously they have abilities too, do they get as many?
[3:29:25] <Decarcassor> Unless they are Eldritch knights, or paladins, or rangers... :p
[3:29:34] <%thelaxinator> need to be drop-down menus on spells with ascended versions
[3:29:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> this seems like something to mention on the larion forums so they know it could be improved
[3:29:37] <Macfine> @dinnydanny777 no not nearly as many
[3:29:40] <%chiazam> Yeah this is gonna get MESSY at higher levels
[3:29:52] <+pectusumbra> alright, buzzing off for about an hour, have fun all!
[3:30:05] <Siebersboy> they should make it just ask you what spell slot level you want to cast at when you do
[3:30:06] <+TheFlyingChurro> The game should just ask what level you want to cast at this is silly
[3:30:07] <St_Burke> at the moment wizards can learn EVERY spell, so
[3:30:13] <%Calek> there's not enough slots for having every spell plus their upcasted version, this is definitely getting reworked
[3:30:14] <%thelaxinator> Wait, what cleric is like "yeah, trickery is the way"
[3:30:14] <@commanderclaw> They should have you choose which level to cast at when you cast it
[3:30:24] <Macfine> Well I think they plan on dealing with the high level mess..by just not having it. the max final level will be 8-12 range
[3:30:46] <%linSP> Look at the fighter with three spells and then there’s the cleric
[3:30:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> this is bullshit
[3:30:51] <dinnydanny777> Wow that's 30 whole spells limesYikes
[3:30:52] <MForan98> @thelaxinator cleric's who's god is about being a tricky dick?
[3:30:54] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt her cleric domain provides her 2 spells per spell level that she never has to prepare.
[3:30:55] <%heartlesshealer> They should just make the individual spellslots into drop-down menus where you pick which spell fits the slot!
[3:30:56] <%Ne1son> The ones without a box are part of your subclass
[3:30:57] <%Calek> level cap was 10 but they said they're going to increase it so who knows
[3:31:06] <%Bt_Robot> NOT GUIDING STRIKE?
[3:31:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> How am I supposed to get Jiggy with a bard before level 14
[3:31:10] <fuji_92> still an 8-12 mage is gonna have a fuckton of spells dude
[3:31:14] <%thelaxinator> Fighter no need spells, only big stick, unga
[3:31:16] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt Shadowheath has spell tied to her Cleric Domain that are always prepared.
[3:31:17] <+MisterMusashi> Cleric's are prepared casters so they can prepare ANY spells from their list
[3:31:33] <SomeAsianDood> All Praise the Traveler @thelaxinator
[3:31:33] <+NitronStreams> there is a I and II above the hotbar. does that do anything do anything?
[3:31:39] <fuji_92> yeah, fighter life for me like geez
[3:31:54] <MillaMoks> @patstaresat She knows every spell you see an icon for, however, she can only cast the ones that are lit up. You can change which ones are lit up every long rest.
[3:32:01] <dinnydanny777> I counted the spell list, there's 30 of them limesO
[3:32:05] <%VashyronM> arcane trickster
[3:32:06] <+Divinity4RAGE> true strike WutFace
[3:32:07] <QuipSan> subclass feature
[3:32:09] <fuji_92> true strike LUL
[3:32:12] <%TheFabledAble> @NitronStreams that shows your spell slots per spell level, which show how many available casts you have of those spells before you run out
[3:32:12] <MForan98> Arcane Trickster gets spells
[3:32:18] <@commanderclaw> His INT is shit, I wouldn't recommend trickster
[3:32:20] <%thelaxinator> Color spray is basically a stun grenade
[3:32:21] <%heartlesshealer> @NitronStreams that just switches which hotbar setup is being currently displayed/used
[3:32:23] <+shabop> switch out true strike
[3:32:29] <stabbityrabbit> Arcane Trickster, but you do have the actual ability to be a thief.
[3:32:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Thief
[3:32:35] <fuji_92> yeah I'd go thief
[3:32:36] <%chiazam> Theif
[3:32:38] <%emperordread> true strike confirmed garbage
[3:32:40] <%Bt_Robot> TRUE STRIKE IS TERRIBLE
[3:32:41] <%Calek> true strike is actually good in this game, lasts two turns
[3:32:44] <Decarcassor> Astarion has low Int he suck has a Trickster
[3:32:44] <Xelgus> dual wield + 2 bonus actions is so good
[3:32:46] <%Ne1son> Theif
[3:32:48] <mrblack499> Arcane Trickster gets alot of spells
[3:32:50] <stabbityrabbit> Just wait until they add Assassin.
[3:32:51] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt thief means 2 attacks as bonus action
[3:32:52] <St_Burke> ooo pats a maverick
[3:32:57] <dinnydanny777> His hair is really fancy
[3:33:00] <HarmlessCrow> Arcane Trickster, for when you regret playing a martial class and need something to do that isn't sneak attack
[3:33:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> So No Assassin
[3:33:07] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt dual weild melee
[3:33:08] <%heartlesshealer> Don't forget Strong Lady
[3:33:13] <@commanderclaw> Dual wield
[3:33:13] <Xelgus> dual wield
[3:33:13] <%TheFabledAble> your offhand uses bohnus action
[3:33:14] <St_Burke> @PatStaresAt you get an attack with a bonus action with dualo weird
[3:33:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Smashes Poision vial"
[3:33:15] <Macfine> Offhand attacks are bonus actions
[3:33:24] <%Pappajimbo> put a dagger in his off hand
[3:33:25] <%chiazam> Battle Master
[3:33:26] <+TheWarpJump> diel wield bonus attack
[3:33:26] <%blitzrush1200> Off hand counts as bonus action
[3:33:41] <fuji_92> Eldrich knight huh
[3:33:43] <%DedlokPM> 1 attack = 1 Action so 2 actions = 2 attacks @PatStaresAt
[3:33:45] <%Nekros4442> Battlemaster
[3:33:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> Eldritch Knight for theming
[3:33:46] <$Afterman_> pushing attack is useless
[3:33:49] <$Afterman_> get riposte
[3:33:54] <%heartlesshealer> Menacing is always fun. Not sure if you'll use Rally???
[3:33:54] <+maximumcrit> she actually doesn't make a bad eldritch knight too, it doesnt need a high intel
[3:33:57] <%emperordread> Jump is amazing
[3:33:58] <ColbyBryant> lol champion is so bad it isnt even in the game LUL
[3:34:03] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt Give you extra damage and specail effect whne you use them
[3:34:07] <%chiazam> You roll a dice that adds to attack
[3:34:07] <fuji_92> jump PogChamp
[3:34:13] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you get 4 superiority die to spend on those battle master abilities. and they recharge on SHORT REST which means she it super effective
[3:34:15] <%linSP> big jump
[3:34:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> She'll hit hard and do magic shit
[3:34:19] <%heartlesshealer> False life is health buffer
[3:34:21] <%SilverKryscent> if there's none of the melee cantrips EK is not good
[3:34:28] <+Kyma1020> a pool of dice ypu get for extra actions and dmg
[3:34:29] <+shabop> good ol repost
[3:34:38] <%hrodbehrat> 'sup Pat, hope you're having a great night.
[3:34:52] <QuipSan> she has a new reaction use now
[3:34:58] <%thelaxinator> big janky
[3:35:04] <+TheWarpJump> whos that by the river?
[3:35:11] <%THATGUY_789> is BG3 fine to start with or should I play 1&2 first?
[3:35:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Every five seconds someoen keeps saying "that isn't in the game" and I aint see alotta yets
[3:35:12] <madogod> No sexy time nap?
[3:35:16] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt The Battle Master subclass gets its own resource called a superiority die. These are spent on manuevers which singlehandedly make playing the Fighter interesting on tabletop, but is yet another thing to keep track of in a full party.
[3:35:19] <Decarcassor> Lae'zel should be a good Eldritch Knight since she is a Githyanki, but her stat spread is borked up.
[3:35:20] <%chiazam> no
[3:35:24] <%thelaxinator> I get the feeling you'll get that every time
[3:35:25] <HarmlessCrow> Shove being a bonus action makes pushing attack way less cool
[3:35:37] <dinnydanny777> That corpse doesn't like you
[3:35:37] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can freely recast speak with dead for the rest of the day
[3:35:42] <@commanderclaw> IIRC you can recast speak with dead on other things for the rest of the day
[3:35:42] <%MonsterEnvy> It's not one and done
[3:35:43] <madogod> where is the sexing of companions?
[3:35:44] <%heartlesshealer> maybe in full
[3:35:46] <%hrodbehrat> zippity zap, gonna make you wap
[3:35:47] <Macfine> yeah the stats of the Party members really pigeonhole them for optimal subclassess sadly
[3:35:47] <+ItalianWaifu> talking to bodies isnt really usefull yet
[3:35:56] <HarmlessCrow> I REALLY hope they let us respec our companions in the final release
[3:35:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The Viths kinda look like Romulans
[3:35:58] <%TheFabledAble> @HarmlessCrow you have two chances to shove though
[3:36:10] <HarmlessCrow> True
[3:36:14] <%linSP> I though communication spells don’t take slots
[3:36:16] <%MonsterEnvy> Look at the bottom
[3:36:16] <+XxBTExX> you get another ability
[3:36:18] <Xelgus> below it idiot
[3:36:18] <@commanderclaw> THere's a new icon
[3:36:21] <+XxBTExX> next to the boot thing
[3:36:25] <StromkoPenguin> It's another button to recast it
[3:36:25] <%MonsterEnvy> There is a new icon called recast
[3:36:26] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you missed the added spell it added to your list
[3:36:31] <$Afterman_> its probably for important dead people only
[3:36:32] <%heartlesshealer> ...
[3:36:33] <%emperordread> New icon says 'Recast speak to dead'
[3:36:35] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt when you cast it it gives you a free recast like hex
[3:36:37] <St_Burke> no
[3:36:41] <%trustycoyote> ...whelp
[3:36:41] <+TheWarpJump> it add a new icon called recast speak with the dead
[3:36:43] <Xelgus> only a little stupid
[3:36:46] <St_Burke> :)
[3:36:46] <+XxBTExX> dont worry happened to me too its not really too self explanatory
[3:36:55] <%MonsterEnvy> No stupid you just missed
[3:36:56] <fuji_92> I mean yes but that's beside the point
[3:36:59] <Macfine> You're not stupid but there is a thing you missed
[3:37:01] <Decarcassor> @Macfine Shadowhearth is the worst. She is a trickery cleric with -1 dex and can't wear heavy armor. Half of her leveling is going to be patching up her flaws. :/
[3:37:07] <%thelaxinator> I guess it works like that because it takes a spell slot?
[3:37:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It may mean "Speak to [Story-Important] Dead"
[3:37:20] <%trustycoyote> You're not stupid... that's a bit stupid
[3:37:23] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, it's a dumb way to do it
[3:37:26] <%MonsterEnvy> You can talk with pretty much any corpse in the game
[3:37:27] <jorniev> if only eating its meat let you talk to the dead
[3:37:29] <%chiazam> climb
[3:37:30] <%TheFabledAble> you arent stupid p[at youre just blind theres a difference ;)
[3:37:31] <%amonimis> yeah that is kinda dumb how it takes up another slot
[3:37:33] <Macfine> @Decarcassor yeah...hopefully there is a "mirror" like in divinity
[3:37:39] <%Meekest> Fucking Druids
[3:37:51] <+PenmanLupine> 1

[3:39:01] <%ClericOfSparda> Big racism
[3:39:01] <Decarcassor> @Macfine If there is an item in the game like a headband of intelect but for Dex, Shadowheath might be salvageable. :/

[3:39:26] <ergulor> He heard you
[3:39:29] <%Meekest> He approves not being here
[3:39:32] <%trustycoyote> carrier pigeon told him what you did
[3:39:32] <Macfine> @Decarcassor even without the DEX, she'll be salvagable. Clerics are really good
[3:39:36] <Zombrocom> He's with you in spirit
[3:39:36] <+AMagicalFlute> I like Shadowheart as a character
[3:39:40] <+NitronStreams> Gale is watching from the bushes
[3:39:42] <fuji_92> 2
[3:39:42] <%thelaxinator> something tells me this tadpole isn't coming out until, like, the 90% mark of the game
[3:39:47] <%Pappajimbo> lie then help for xp anyway
[3:39:52] <+AMagicalFlute> Like she's unapologetically an asshole
[3:40:00] <%MonsterEnvy> Talk to Zavlor
[3:40:01] <%heartlesshealer> pretty
[3:40:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Talk to mean green
[3:40:02] <%chiazam> @thelaxinator Or not at all
[3:40:04] <%Meekest> FORT JOY 2
[3:40:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This must be some kind of SUPER tadpole for special reasons
[3:40:23] <+Rofiarf> it does that sometimes
[3:40:23] <Macfine> @thelaxinator i imagine it will be about the same point you start removing the collars in divinity...
[3:40:24] <Decarcassor> @Macfine Sure she can always hang back and cast spells. its just a bit boring and generic.
[3:40:25] <%heartlesshealer> ???
[3:40:30] <+AMagicalFlute> This area is 1000% better than Fort Joy dear god
[3:40:30] <%hoodedlefty> I assume pats leaving that twitch notice thing up for some bit
[3:40:32] <%heartlesshealer> showed choices too soon?
[3:40:32] <%Aztec50> Now this is a demon man
[3:40:32] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> the options pop up early sometimes
[3:40:34] <+Rofiarf> where the options show up before they are done
[3:40:38] <St_Burke> @thelaxinator you ask me this seems like a first half kind of story
[3:40:45] <%emperordread> His eyes pulse, it's gross
[3:40:50] <+Rofiarf> you didn'y pick anything don't worry
[3:40:56] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt some of the convos are bugges in that the transition stutters making you think you skipped something, dont worry about it its not you and you likely arent missing anything
[3:41:01] <Decarcassor> @Macfine She'd be fine if she wasn't a Trickery Cleric.
[3:41:04] <stabbityrabbit> How come he has cool eyes but Pat doesn't?
[3:41:16] <%heartlesshealer> xenophobia
[3:41:22] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Whats the name of hot orc girl
[3:41:22] <Macfine> @Decarcassor she'll still manage
[3:41:23] <$joylent_blue> that's the thing he's sensitive about pvpD
[3:41:31] <%linSP> Go up the cliff near the entrance for a fight
[3:41:31] <+shry7> how do you get his cool eyes
[3:41:41] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @stabbityrabbit different race of tiefling?
[3:41:49] <+twohitgood> did they just give him particle effects for retinas?
[3:41:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nettie the [PARTY MEMBER]

[3:42:02] <%TheFabledAble> 1
[3:42:08] <%trustycoyote> gunna need more than an bandaid, bruh
[3:42:15] <%Parapattern> I like the cut of this guy's jib
[3:42:18] <+twohitgood> his retinas are just fire particle effects, i think.
[3:42:20] <socratetris> about how long has Pat been playing? I'm here late
[3:42:25] <jorniev> jsut a minor SERIOUS CASE OF BRAIN DAMAGE
[3:42:36] <%TheFabledAble> 3
[3:42:37] <$joylent_blue> pat's character just looks like a human with blue face paint compared to this guy
[3:42:38] <%heartlesshealer> that hover
[3:42:43] <%thelaxinator> I'm afraid I need complex neurosurgery, on a budget and as a walk-in.
[3:42:44] <%Meekest> Save refugees or kill refugees
[3:42:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Of course, this dude is cool
[3:42:50] <St_Burke> oh cool Astarion cut in on that one
[3:42:50] <%chiazam> Gale approves
[3:42:51] <Decarcassor> A yes, "Rituals" magic bullshit that does not work like any other magic is the game, are never explained and PC can't do. Classic.
[3:42:51] <+NitronStreams> Why does this guy have the Eye of Sauron?
[3:42:51] <johngamefreak> Why are you not a Gith named Buscemi?
[3:43:06] <$Afterman_> pat go save a girl
[3:43:15] <+mqsammy> SUCKERS. always get payment upfront.
[3:43:16] <%Nekros4442> Food heals you btw
[3:43:19] <StromkoPenguin> Potatoes give back like 3 HP a piece
[3:43:21] <%heartlesshealer> cooking tho
[3:43:22] <%Nekros4442> it's super useful
[3:43:25] <%Broand> I kind of want more evil tieflings in games
[3:43:27] <%heartlesshealer> cooking heals HP
