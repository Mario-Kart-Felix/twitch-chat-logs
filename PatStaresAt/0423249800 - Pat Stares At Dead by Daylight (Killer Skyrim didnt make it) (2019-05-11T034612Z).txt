[0:07:56] <Sloavon> ????????
[0:08:00] <+RC_S3kshun8> @Italian_Love_Cake Thanks brochacho
[0:08:02] <%nmaten> billys real good
[0:08:06] <%driemen> @gorillahandz I hope you're doing well, too!
[0:08:06] <%kiiiirsten> I come back to Not Skyrim wow
[0:08:07] <emillionghost> !uptime
[0:08:07] <Huntercd> Where do those hooks come from?
[0:08:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 43m.
[0:08:17] <$Italian_Love_Cake> I'm a huge fan of Spirit. Billy is fun too. I wanna give Plague a try.
[0:08:18] <+Estuko> I'm expecting this map to zoom out and turn into a fucking XCOM mission view LUL
[0:08:19] <gorillahandz> :)
[0:08:20] <%spiritofmojave> @Estuko Mage-fashion best fashion, always and forever haha
[0:08:20] <+RC_S3kshun8> @Italian_Love_Cake I'm not as familiar with this game other than all the killers are homages to classic films
[0:08:23] <takokasa> Hag is like the 5th best killer in the game
[0:08:24] <%Kataguro> I hate hag. She spooks me so hard
[0:08:26] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat If they get pissed off it means you're playing right
[0:08:26] <Pookiedaexzile> See paige Pat plays Survivor everyday with everyone taller than him
[0:08:27] <%fredan31> what happend with skyrim?
[0:08:29] <MissJenniecide> no killer freaks me out like meyers tho
[0:08:30] <Animal_Farm4> Hag has the unfortunate fate of being a killer based on proxy camping to be effective
[0:08:32] <%deviljhojho94> scary lads
[0:08:34] <Cymen90> @fredan31 Died
[0:08:41] <+Estuko> @spiritofmojave doodBro I feel we'll have good talks as friends of culture
[0:08:47] <Madbearv> it died because bethesda can't code a game
[0:08:50] <%Niney_Who> Meyers is my favorite
[0:08:53] <%NWR_James> WHIF
[0:08:53] <+Sendaar> We're all good as long as you dont play Legion
[0:08:53] <$Italian_Love_Cake> I can never win in a game with Myers.
[0:08:54] <%Darthwaffler> Whif
[0:08:56] <takokasa> big dead hards
[0:08:56] <%fredan31> @Cymen90 it just crashed a bunch?
[0:09:02] <%Agami23> apparently they are adding ghostface next @AngriestPat @PeachSaliva
[0:09:02] <+Sendaar> Though I guess now with his nerf he's okay
[0:09:02] <%DedlokPM> "She creates the biggest Paige yells" So in other words, The Hag is better than Pat in bed. teenB
[0:09:03] <MissJenniecide> aw boooo! no dc!
[0:09:05] <%Kataguro> That just means you're killing VERY hard
[0:09:06] <+tigerfang86> LUL
[0:09:09] <+griffball13> rage quit toxic
[0:09:10] <tUxUt> BOO URNS
[0:09:13] <$Italian_Love_Cake> If Myers is the killer and I'm survivor, I have no chance.
[0:09:16] <%SlackerAlex> Boooo-urns
[0:09:17] <%ShogunNoonto> booo are boooyaaa
[0:09:25] <Cymen90> @fredan31 At first, bad performance but also, Pat modded the game to be too hard for him ROFL
[0:09:25] <takokasa> Just play Freddy. Every game will have like 3 DCs
[0:09:26] <%spiritofmojave> @Estuko I'd drink to that!
[0:09:32] <$Italian_Love_Cake> Yeah, they just collapse somewhere.
[0:09:34] <+VidyaFranX> Where's da BBQ. You'rse losing BP as we speak
[0:09:39] <+Sendaar> Freddy is easily the worst killer LUL
[0:09:44] <$Italian_Love_Cake> One person disconnected while crawling through a window
[0:09:44] <%fredan31> @Cymen90 sounds right
[0:09:51] <+Talbz> Is the Ash DLC out yet?
[0:09:55] <%Dementedpenguin> Hell no
[0:09:56] <ScreamingMeat> LUL
[0:10:01] <$RaikenTB> it's free points.
[0:10:03] <%Darthwaffler> I always have people DC just before a hook :(
[0:10:03] <takokasa> People DC super hard against Freddy at low ranks, though, which is weird because he's shitty
[0:10:05] <%DedlokPM> @Talbz it has been out for a while
[0:10:13] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I almost feel like I am playing her wrong, but I love playing Spirit FeelsBadMan
[0:10:13] <takokasa> Like there's no reason to DC against a Freddy
[0:10:15] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat You'll get nothing and like it
[0:10:17] <%Agami23> fuck that play to win
[0:10:19] <$Italian_Love_Cake> A friend of mine and two survivors did a give and take match when two people DC'd a match.
[0:10:20] <Animal_Farm4> I don't need your Pity Paige :(
[0:10:21] <TMulharin> Fuck "polite". play to win.
[0:10:23] <PoisonKnuckle> I’m back. I guess no more Skyrim? LUL
[0:10:23] <+Estuko> @Italian_Love_Cake same I'd have to ask him to sign my Waynes World copy NotLikeThis it'd get me killed easily
[0:10:25] <+Talbz> @DedlokPM thanks, I dont keep up with this game
[0:10:33] <Crankthulhu> Does Pat know about the new endgame condition?
[0:10:36] <Cymen90> ???????????
[0:10:39] <%Dementedpenguin> And while we're at it, fuck the "respect the 4%"
[0:10:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why would someone have a gas generator in their basement?
[0:10:41] <+BoomerTiro> If you're obviously trouncing them you should totally give them false hope so that they don;t quit and their dreams are crushed harder in the end.
[0:10:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> FIRE HAZARD
[0:10:48] <+Sendaar> Is the collapse thing in the game yet or is that still ptr
[0:10:48] <%TheCrispyBoi> blind
[0:10:58] <takokasa> endgame collapse is in the game
[0:11:02] <MissJenniecide> big oof
[0:11:04] <+tigerfang86> lmao
[0:11:04] <callsigneagle01> Is that weird?
[0:11:06] <%Kataguro> Blood for the spider god
[0:11:06] <takokasa> So don't fuck around when the gate is open
[0:11:11] <callsigneagle01> Generators are super useful
[0:11:11] <%NWR_James> TINY HIDE
[0:11:19] <callsigneagle01> if the power goes out in a disaster or something
[0:11:20] <%blastazoid26> what happened to skyrim?
[0:11:24] <%sshen> You may as well just have teabagged that person Pat
[0:11:28] <takokasa> skyrim was bad and difficult
[0:11:30] <+Estuko> That scream really gets in my ears

[0:11:40] <%Zamorouskiwhich> LUL
[0:11:41] <%Kataguro> That's fine. This is way more exciting
[0:11:42] <callsigneagle01> Like we always had gas generators around here cause hurricanes caused long-ass power loss
[0:11:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> ( he got bored )
[0:11:43] <%NWR_James> Fix it WITH MORE MODS
[0:11:44] <Dhurkst> TOO MANY COOKS
[0:11:44] <%blastazoid26> LUL
[0:11:46] <MissJenniecide> skryim was ruined!
[0:11:47] <JoeStillLife> So many mods Pat fell through the world in real life
[0:11:47] <thelonechris> Oops! All mods!
[0:11:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Too many cooks~
[0:11:48] <$Italian_Love_Cake> Alrighty
[0:11:48] <%skizzuto> Skyrim was too hard for him
[0:11:50] <%MonsieurHedge> MonsieurHedge subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:11:51] <%spiritofmojave> A less boring Skyrim?
[0:11:51] <Animal_Farm4> Kindler?
[0:11:53] <hntronium> Kindler
[0:11:56] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat honestly not mad because, I'd be more surprised if you pulled off all those mods so easily
[0:11:57] <ScreamingMeat> Kindler
[0:11:58] <%ssjklyco> 300 mods next week
[0:11:58] <$Italian_Love_Cake> DBD is still fun though :3
[0:11:58] <%spiritofmojave> Oh wait that's not possible sugoiSmugsnake
[0:11:59] <HoldBtoRun> lol, I went to do some stuff and came back to DbD and was like, "I bet he modded it too much"
[0:11:59] <BigCoffee> You didn't have too many mods, your dumb build doesn't work with that mod, that's all
[0:12:01] <+NerevaRising> Cleaner faces?
[0:12:01] <PoisonKnuckle> FUCK IT!
[0:12:02] <%blastazoid26> Or just come back with ESO
[0:12:02] <%sshen> Was it too many mods or was it not enough mods
[0:12:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Man, all these houses got generators inside. That is a FIRE HAZARD
[0:12:06] <+Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc I REMEMBER THAT
[0:12:09] <%SirKamBam> I didn't get a discord link apatCanada
[0:12:19] <%valriot> Its takes a lot to fuck a game, a Todd Howard and Ginger babe~
[0:12:28] <Zombrocom> Bush > Chainsaw
[0:12:28] <+miguelrod777> JUKED
[0:12:29] <Madbearv> ah man you should be able to be skeletor in this
[0:12:36] <takokasa> metal bushes, the ultimate chainsaw deterrent
[0:12:37] <%sshen> @SirKamBam There's no discord link, if your twitch is linked to your discord it will show up under your connections in user settings
[0:12:38] <%Divryne> Paige got them skeleton hornies still.
[0:12:45] <Cymen90> BAMBOOZLED
[0:12:46] <%Jetsfantasy> Now you fucked up
[0:12:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> NYEHH

[0:12:50] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[0:12:50] <+RC_S3kshun8> @PlagueOfGripes How's the book stuff going? The premise from WWFIO sounded really cool. Would definitely be interested in more.
[0:12:50] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 48m.
[0:12:51] <antshadow14> darksydpat
[0:12:51] <%Kataguro> He's not really like deadly
[0:12:56] <TalisKanju> Stream over?

[0:12:59] <%dreampipe332> nyeheheheh survivors
[0:13:04] <+BoomerTiro> Skeleton Man, see through their plan with your skeleton eyes!
[0:13:05] <%Ilpala> she has a FEVER

[0:13:10] <%ShogunNoonto> only if you can get he-man too
[0:13:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> She's attracted to the stench of death
[0:13:11] <takokasa> haddonfield is easily one of the top 3 shittiest killer maps
[0:13:11] <%Ilpala> and the solution is more skeleton
[0:13:11] <Huntercd> Evilyn was so hot in He-Man
[0:13:13] <$Piemono> Didn't the knew killer get leaked?
[0:13:14] <+ChaosVulpes> Has Paige watched OVERLORD? She'd love the main character Ainz...
[0:13:17] <MissJenniecide> i'm worried about possibly going up against scream later
[0:13:27] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m sorry Paige I’m happily married... to villainy!

[0:13:59] <%sshen> From scary movie
[0:14:00] <Dhurkst> They should put in Ghostface Killah for April Fools
[0:14:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Who else is left at this point?
[0:14:03] <%valriot> His special skill is that he goes to jail
[0:14:04] <Madbearv> I'm surprised they've gotten all the IP holders to play nice
[0:14:09] <MissJenniecide> no phone D:
[0:14:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> The white people from Get out?
[0:14:09] <Huntercd> The entire Wu Tang Clan would be sick

[0:14:34] <+BoomerTiro> Horror Movie people are super nice
[0:14:37] <%Jetsfantasy> It's because all their IP's are dead otherwise
[0:14:41] <lilmac64> For real, that lady with the Anarchy jacket could be an opera singer.
[0:14:44] <takokasa> pigsaw is getting some new cosemtics

[0:14:56] <gustavozxd> big money
[0:14:59] <Madbearv> Their lawyers must be amazing
[0:15:00] <takokasa> Tapp is also getting a better cop outfit
[0:15:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should add either Death Bed, Leprechaun, or the Gingergead Man.
[0:15:03] <%kiiiirsten> I LOVE Paige's DBD streams so I'm super pumped that Pat is playing AND he's Killer
[0:15:08] <%hawk_rush> yeaaaah, dead by daylight

[0:15:48] <suikudo> that would be dope
[0:15:48] <callsigneagle01> So Pat?
[0:15:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> Leprachan 3 Back to the West Coast
[0:15:50] <%valriot> Chucky makes sense, what with the new movie
[0:15:52] <$Italian_Love_Cake> Spirit is my favorite. Her backstory is real tragic.
[0:15:52] <lilmac64> A d d p a t
[0:15:54] <ManfredA> Chucky would be great
[0:15:55] <takokasa> Leprechaun and Chucky require new animations because they're too small to carry survivors, so that isn't happening soon
[0:15:56] <+BoomerTiro> This game already has Mike Meyers so I am good
[0:15:57] <scrumbotime> a perfect killer for pat

[0:16:56] <thelonechris> Death from Final Destination Kappa
[0:16:57] <+BoomerTiro> Slender Man would be awful because he just stands there... menacingly.
[0:17:02] <+neuwaive> Slenderman: Nurse 2
[0:17:02] <callsigneagle01> Scorpion
[0:17:03] <%nofestu2> Slender Man would be great if he didn't have such a bad reputation now.
[0:17:03] <abakkus> wishmaster when
[0:17:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> Hands sandwitches to the survivors
[0:17:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Do they have John Carpenter's IT?
[0:17:10] <DracaenaLeaf> that ass
[0:17:10] <+BoomerTiro> He's really more psychological horror
[0:17:12] <CptBritches> But it would be too abusable to just keep one player looking at him
[0:17:13] <%izaich> @callsigneagle01 goro can hook two people at once
[0:17:15] <suikudo> Is it me or does she have a huge ass?
[0:17:17] <Pookiedaexzile> He ho

[0:17:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pinhead could be rad too
[0:17:25] <%SoraX64> SoraX64 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[0:17:26] <callsigneagle01> @izaich that'd be sick
[0:17:27] <ManfredA> The thing being able to disguise as a survivor would be horrifying
[0:17:31] <%CaptainTubaki> @PlainSimpleTailor they have a clown but not like IT
[0:17:35] <+alextheblight> hi Billy

[0:17:43] <%ssjklyco> Jack from Resident Evil 7
[0:17:45] <kitsune128> @angriestpat did you watch the new IT trailer? Do you think Pennyweiss could be in DBD
[0:17:45] <Madbearv> Pinhead would be great
[0:17:47] <+chrishnaw> Who you callin a pinhead?
[0:17:52] <TheDrown> The Thing, disguises itself as a survivor
[0:17:56] <%wvuboii> Survivors get nerfed way too much cause killers complain
[0:17:56] <callsigneagle01> Shao Kahn
[0:17:57] <%Cavumentum> Okay but Pumpkinhead when
[0:17:59] <%Agami23> what about that dude from dont breath
[0:18:01] <+alextheblight> Pinhead would be great
[0:18:02] <+VidyaFranX> The shark from Jaws should be a killer
[0:18:03] <ManfredA> no Gacy was right Pat
[0:18:06] <silverira> I want SCP-096
[0:18:06] <%PlainSimpleTailor> OOOF don't talk about Gacy
[0:18:07] <%Dementedpenguin> Last Year needs content. BADLY
[0:18:08] <BourneWarrior> John Wayne Gacy is correct
[0:18:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheDrown that is too strong
[0:18:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Ed GEEN
[0:18:09] <%thebonebard> last year is good but needs more killers
[0:18:10] <%izaich> patrick bateman could stun survivors with his sexy business cards and huey lewis and the news
[0:18:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Have Us killers where it's just dupes of the survivors
[0:18:13] <%deviljhojho94> what a fucker
[0:18:17] <Dhurkst> @ssjklyco Welcome to the falmleh, SON!
[0:18:19] <shackbox> discord deal?
[0:18:21] <Crankthulhu> I heard Last Year has really bad voice chat, which is odd because it's funded by... discord
[0:18:22] <$Dutchpotato> discord deal?
[0:18:25] <ThespianBarrage> So my friend was asking me. "What's white people's obsession for serial killers?" I couldn't answer him.
[0:18:27] <shackbox> what was the discord deal?
[0:18:28] <Madbearv> I'm uh
[0:18:31] <+VidyaFranX> I Kickstarted Last Year, but I haven't touchced it because it's a Discord game
[0:18:32] <callsigneagle01> The Birds from Birdemic
[0:18:32] <ProjektRF> Its only on discord
[0:18:33] <%nikoloas_> I forgot discord had a store
[0:18:34] <Scorian> being on discord and not steam LUL
[0:18:34] <%thecalvalierone> Put the clown terrifier in
[0:18:35] <Crankthulhu> @Dutchpotato Exclusive toDiscord Store

[0:18:48] <$Dutchpotato> discord stgore??? thats a thing
[0:18:50] <starotter70> OK, so I was gone for a bit, we doing DBD now?
[0:18:51] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Did you hear about the new Predator game like F13 coming out next year?
[0:18:53] <$Dutchpotato> store even
[0:18:54] <+Fling_Ding> I think it's coming to steam soon
[0:18:56] <tinyseahorse> anybody watch those shit gingerdead movies? the gingerdead man in this would be lol
[0:18:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThespianBarrage Its a natural need to understand the unknown and broken
[0:18:59] <+tigerfang86> Dance on the generator
[0:18:59] <takokasa> a world of magic and doom
[0:19:01] <+Shaggnar> Yeah, I don't want to use discord as a store
[0:19:01] <+tigerfang86> it's the ONLY WAY
[0:19:03] <Madbearv> No 10 year olds screaming racial names at you
[0:19:05] <+tigerfang86> THE ONLY WAY
[0:19:05] <DrkJP520> Does this game have pyramid head?
[0:19:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeah Skyrim has to many mods, it was borked
[0:19:18] <@lewdskeletor13> So he switched
[0:19:18] <callsigneagle01> They should add Santa Claws cause no one else knows what that is
[0:19:19] <%izaich> thats why candyman is the best choice, because bees communicate by dancing
[0:19:22] <starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 Gotcha
[0:19:28] <mayorrev> @PeachSaliva It's on Discord at the moment, i backed it and got a copy
[0:19:31] <takokasa> Last Year coming to steam 2 months after it fucking died
[0:19:36] <+tigerfang86> just ded
[0:19:39] <+tigerfang86> very ded
[0:19:44] <+beensupe> @AngriestPat how would you think Xenomorph as a killer would work
[0:19:44] <%Darthwaffler> the thickness is down
[0:19:49] <+Saggitori> damn she got a donk
[0:19:53] <Hoisengineer> i almost downloaded it though discord since i had a free copy but it would take like half a day so i haven't bothered
[0:19:53] <Dhurkst> @ThespianBarrage I've NEVER noticed before that every single person obsessed with serial killers is white... TIL...
[0:19:55] <+BoomerTiro> Down with the thickness
[0:19:56] <takokasa> Jane is the thiccest
[0:19:59] <%CaptainTubaki> aw no not thiccness
[0:20:10] <ThespianBarrage> @Dhurkst IKR?
[0:20:12] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[0:20:14] <turf_wind_and_fire> @peachsaliva dumb question but Paige are you going back to Japan for work?
[0:20:16] <Dr_Mooose> space hook?
[0:20:17] <%Cavumentum> Okay but PUMPKINHEAD
[0:20:17] <+tigerfang86> BUT THE HOOKS PAIGE
[0:20:18] <romanticzomedy> she'd put them on her tail!
[0:20:19] <Hoisengineer> NO SHUT UP THO
[0:20:20] <+tigerfang86> THE HOOKS
[0:20:20] <$RaikenTB> It would cocoon them instead.
[0:20:20] <EASrake> Stick em to walls tho
[0:20:20] <%TheCrispyBoi> they do tho
[0:20:21] <%NWR_James> The Predator would
[0:20:21] <%Laecerelius> Change hook to a face hugger thingy
[0:20:22] <tinyseahorse> predator would hook a fool
[0:20:23] <ManfredA> what about the predator
[0:20:25] <dougrh> what about the guy from jeeper creepers
[0:20:25] <+tigerfang86> THE HOOKS PAIGE
[0:20:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> GIANT ENEMY CRaB
[0:20:26] <riotshark> well technically they put them in caccons tho
[0:20:26] <takokasa> The alien is too inhuman to follow entity instructions
[0:20:26] <+AnIcedCoffee> The Predator would put people on a hook
[0:20:27] <ojama1987> it wouldnt hook, but it would plaster you to a wall i dunno
[0:20:27] <%Agami23> the xenomorph would put them onto walls.
[0:20:27] <silverira> what about the Predator?
[0:20:27] <FunkyStreams> theyre all hummanoids thought, I agree with Pat.
[0:20:28] <%spiritofmojave> Magical GIANT ENEMY CRAB
[0:20:28] <%MonsieurHedge> what do you MEAN webbing epople to walls for facehuggin' purposes is BASICALLY hooking someone
[0:20:28] <+BoomerTiro> Xenomorphs drag living things back to their nest to stick to a wall all the time1 @AngriestPat
[0:20:30] <$MajorCrasher> why would Michael put someone on a hook
[0:20:32] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat They said there's never gonna be a non-human Killer
[0:20:32] <+ChaosVulpes> Xenomorph could put them in a cocoon over an egg
[0:20:32] <Pookiedaexzile> PREDATOR
[0:20:33] <+xGreenflame> Just replace the hook with a nest or something
[0:20:33] <%thebonebard> maybe it could do somthing else like chest burster
[0:20:33] <%GarbageNirvana> What about those crazy breeder walls in Aliens
[0:20:33] <%deviljhojho94> FEED THE CRAB
[0:20:34] <suikudo> instead of a hook it would be the hive queen
[0:20:34] <kerotuyu> Alien the most magical
[0:20:35] <lotharrio> Xenomorph could cocoon people, though.
[0:20:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat What about the predator
[0:20:36] <Mariakko> What about some random guy dressed up as a xenomorph?
[0:20:36] <%nofestu2> yes he would
[0:20:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Amazing stealth
[0:20:37] <%Kataguro> What a hero. A head hero
[0:20:37] <+bromontana> just change the hook to a nest
[0:20:37] <%Laecerelius> Yeah! Predator would hook fuckers all day!
[0:20:38] <lotharrio> On hooks.
[0:20:39] <Madbearv> the rights be a problem for xenomorph
[0:20:42] <+Shaggnar> They could make an HR Geiger hook
[0:20:42] <%valriot> Xenomorph is also the most FUCKED opposion ever, its so strong
[0:20:42] <Animal_Farm4> Freddy already serves wierd ghosts so this is normal for him
[0:20:43] <%Kataguro> Dead
[0:20:46] <LokimenD> Freddy totally would tho
[0:20:47] <CalderGaming> Freddy Krueger: The Mind Power To Hook
[0:20:48] <xeros720> turn the hooks into egg chambers, problem solved
[0:20:49] <GreggyGallz> predator
[0:20:49] <gustavozxd> the predator would be sick
[0:20:50] <%thebonebard> @AngriestPat alien could plant chest bursters
[0:20:50] <%NWR_James> Predator would hook em and get hot on it
[0:20:54] <starotter70> Xenomorph could totally work
[0:20:56] <Tracazoid> What if they skin hooks into the walls the Aliens stick their prey too.
[0:20:56] <Huntercd> Predator would be better
[0:20:58] <%a_shybot> a_shybot subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:21:00] <romanticzomedy> Sadako?
[0:21:00] <xxshadowxx416> i hate this game olny for play as a teen is so bad
[0:21:02] <takokasa> Freddy doesn't have a choice. Quentin basically signed a deal with the entity that Freddy HAS to work for it according to his lore
[0:21:03] <%Kataguro> Whatcha Gonna Do?!
[0:21:04] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat Jeepers Creepers
[0:21:05] <%ssjklyco> The family from RE7 would be good. Margaret and Jack
[0:21:06] <%Ragnarok_Flames> @PeachSaliva Candyman
[0:21:07] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat Xenos placed folks on walls in Aliens, I can see the entity twisting that.
[0:21:09] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[0:21:09] <Mogel56> Instead of ahook theyd beofferedd to the xeno queen
[0:21:09] <%Dementedpenguin> DarkMode Close the hatch
[0:21:10] <eureka60> kiteman when
[0:21:13] <+tigerfang86> LARGE SUCK
[0:21:13] <kitsune128> Keepers creepers
[0:21:13] <%DedlokPM> LUL
[0:21:14] <%Bearphonics> What about, and here's a thought, Scorpion from MK?
[0:21:14] <+alextheblight> the Night Man from Always Sunny as a killer
[0:21:15] <thelonechris> SUCC
[0:21:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Predator would rub his nips all over this cermony hook shit
[0:21:15] <+tigerfang86> HUGE SUCK
[0:21:16] <Animal_Farm4> So you want a killer that ignores game mechanics Paige?
[0:21:17] <%NWR_James> ?
[0:21:20] <$Italian_Love_Cake> That's a mood
[0:21:20] <+BlockingDisabled> A Mortal Kombat character would rule!

[0:21:31] <callsigneagle01> Goro
[0:21:31] <%maskedriderhero> i missed it
[0:21:31] <spicecrisis> Jeepers Creeper monster can fly and he uses traps
[0:21:31] <+griffball13> Hey Paige how about jeepers creepers
[0:21:31] <BourneWarrior> Predator has his own 4v1 game coming out though
[0:21:33] <callsigneagle01> Sheeva
[0:21:33] <%maskedriderhero> what happ
[0:21:33] <FunkyStreams> would be cool if they added Darkman
[0:21:33] <Shimmying_skeleton> i dont get it what sucks?
[0:21:39] <%kiiiirsten> Far as FUCK!
[0:21:40] <Enryuan> What did pat do? I don't understand this game
[0:21:40] <$Italian_Love_Cake> Don't. Sometimes they get lucky during endgame
[0:21:41] <starotter70> Pinhead
[0:21:43] <CSNG> The giant claw!
[0:21:45] <kitsune128> Jeeper creeper can fly! That would be sick!
[0:21:45] <callsigneagle01> Legit though I'd like to see Noob Saibot
[0:21:46] <Pookiedaexzile> If its a Mortal Kombat Character we gotta go with Goro
[0:21:46] <dougrh> what about zombie ash from army of darkness?
[0:21:51] <callsigneagle01> I have no clue how he'd work
[0:21:52] <%Afterman_> why not a killer with minions
[0:21:54] <exileshadow03> Imagine Jeepers Creepers with his truck powers. Or they just add the Semi truck from Maximum Overdrive lmao
[0:21:55] <+BoomerTiro> @AngriestPat Hey, HEY, xenomorph drags living prey to stick to the walls of the next all the time
[0:21:56] <LokimenD> What about a Shoggoth?
[0:22:00] <%SaltyDongs> the birds
[0:22:02] <+BoomerTiro> nest*
[0:22:05] <+alextheblight> Noob Saibot. he already has a hook weapon (well, scythe, but still)
[0:22:06] <+Fling_Ding> I want chucky but I have no clue how it would work
[0:22:06] <takokasa> This person is turbo fucked
[0:22:06] <+tigerfang86> CAMP HUGE
[0:22:06] <callsigneagle01> Zombie Liu Kang
[0:22:10] <+tigerfang86> HUGE CAMPING
[0:22:15] <$RaikenTB> why are the exits on the same side?
[0:22:16] <%Darthwaffler> I want Jan Valek from John Carpenter's Vampires as a killer
[0:22:17] <+Ace5335> It should be
[0:22:17] <Dhurkst> This game needs Jack Baker with the chainsaw scissors.
[0:22:18] <%Kataguro> Play To Win, motherfuckers
[0:22:21] <eureka60> is there like an imposter killer
[0:22:25] <+imporia_> a classic monster would be fun: dracula, werewolf, frankenstein
[0:22:25] <Prism_Wing> Woah, Skyrim gets weird early.
[0:22:26] <FunkyStreams> Evil Ash would be a good one as well.
[0:22:27] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[0:22:28] <%DedlokPM> Does not help that this map spawned the exits LITERALLY NEXT TO EACH OTHER
[0:22:31] <ValidVenasaur> Just got here what happened with Skyrim?
[0:22:33] <%valriot> Speakin of Xenomorph, i beat Alien Isolation the other day. Great game but never really hits its stride
[0:22:36] <+GiantsKnife> pat end her

[0:22:43] <%Divryne> NO MERCY.
[0:22:44] <Pookiedaexzile> for all my fellow blacks, What about SNoop dog from the cult classic Bones
[0:22:45] <+GiantsKnife> i agree but when life hands you a freebie you take it
[0:22:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> A betrayer survivor would be a good enemy
[0:22:48] <Madbearv> she thicc
[0:22:48] <takokasa> NO MERCY rooREE
[0:22:48] <%Kataguro> Blood for the spider god
[0:22:49] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[0:22:50] <$Italian_Love_Cake> @enryuan The killer closing a hatch or the survivors opening one of the doors puts the timer up. The fewer survivors on the map, the faster the countdown goes.

[0:24:16] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:24:22] <%dreampipe332> Hey Pat have you ever played the Vommy Mommy? (the Plague)
[0:24:23] <Pookiedaexzile> What about Ichi the Killer for Dead by Daylight, Kicking people in half and shit

[0:25:17] <%tyrant00000> @AngriestPat how do you feel about the plague killer
[0:25:17] <+ChaosVulpes> Xenomorph could work as a killer, change the hook into a slime sac over a facehugger egg.

[0:25:19] <Madbearv> But yea, play to win

[0:27:49] <%spiritofmojave> Oh shit, I preordered Kiwami 2 and still haven't played it on PC
[0:27:50] <%Darthwaffler> Bowser for new killer
[0:27:52] <DevilDeus13> Herbert West (Reanimator) should be another Ash style guest survivor
[0:27:54] <flubber3d> this stream is scarier than the cube movie
[0:27:56] <%spiritofmojave> That came out the 9th I think?
[0:28:10] <starotter70> Rat for New Killer
[0:28:10] <takokasa> Disco Dance

[0:28:33] <%Cavumentum> the next Killer has been revealed: A VELOCIRAPTOR
[0:28:33] <+beensupe> @AngriestPat would you like to see classic monsters as killers like Dracula, Wolfman, Mummy, etc
[0:28:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its BILL!
[0:28:43] <%THATGUY_789> new skymo
[0:28:48] <@PeachSaliva> @Cavumentum God, I wish
[0:28:49] <takokasa> The Plague is kind of a mummy
[0:28:53] <Dhurkst> @beensupe and creature from the black lagoon!
[0:28:55] <callsigneagle01> @beensupe that'd be pretty sweet to see
[0:28:57] <takokasa> she's definitely a vommy mommy

[0:29:08] <callsigneagle01> the most not-south southern state ever
[0:29:13] <@PeachSaliva> @takokasa I'm still mad she doesn't shit AND vomit
[0:29:14] <@lewdskeletor13> That’s all accurate
[0:29:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @takokasa And there is a killer named plague
[0:29:20] <%DigitalJoshie> man that's actually accurate
[0:29:21] <romanticzomedy> twd boring
[0:29:33] <+razorknight> Florida is going to become the new Atlantis when the sea levels rise enough
[0:29:33] <%logoth_> Its bill!
[0:29:34] <%Kataguro> I've heard it's actually good, which makes all the shit happening a shame
[0:29:36] <%Merkensteiner> Florida is awful
[0:29:49] <callsigneagle01> Florida is so cool and weird I'm simultaneously proud and disgusted it's a part of the US
[0:29:51] <DefaultSettiings> "elmos sitting weird" - goblin man sitting on his legs while on a couch
[0:29:53] <%THATGUY_789> @peachsaliva do think jeepers creepers mob would work
[0:29:59] <takokasa> The streamers as killer is so you can play like an asshole and not feel bad about it
[0:30:02] <+razorknight> I live in Florida it's actually boring when you live here
[0:30:03] <%Darthwaffler> I still think Jan Valek from John Carpenter's Vampires would be a good killer
[0:30:04] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat you guys ever think about doing lets watch's?
[0:30:08] <+razorknight> the insanity seems normal after a while
[0:30:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> florida will sink into the earth
[0:30:12] <%logoth_> When is The Bye Bye Man coming to Dead by Daylight
[0:30:15] <callsigneagle01> @razorknight it's not Louisiana so eh
[0:30:23] <%Agami23> fuck those movies!
[0:30:24] <%Kataguro> Does anyone else think it's really cute to see Pat and Paige on equal footing when it comes to lingo of a game? I think it's super adorable.
[0:30:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> NO
[0:30:25] <%spiritofmojave> Florida should return to the primordial muck
[0:30:26] <callsigneagle01> I'd take Florida Man any day
[0:30:27] <%Toynota10> Florida is a comfy state
[0:30:28] <%logoth_> Yes
[0:30:29] <+tigerfang86> BYE BYE MAN
[0:30:31] <gorillahandz> would xenomorphs work? were they mentioned?
[0:30:32] <%deviljhojho94> jeepers creepers is the one with the pedo director no?
[0:30:33] <+BoomerTiro> The Peepee Poopoo Man
[0:30:33] <ManfredA> there's some legal/ethical issues involving the character @Paige
[0:30:34] <+WonderLandGhost> Jeepers Creepers is directed by a guy who was criminally charged for being a pedophile
[0:30:35] <HoldBtoRun> Let's go BYE BYE MAN
[0:30:35] <%PlainSimpleTailor> NO! BANISH Jeepers Creepers
[0:30:35] <EASrake> The poopoo peepee man
[0:30:36] <+WonderLandGhost> so uh
[0:30:36] <ChoculaUltra> what about Lumberjack Dexter from the last season of Dexter
[0:30:37] <thelonechris> The Pee Pee Poo Poo Man
[0:30:37] <12gagerager> Its a great schlocky movie series
[0:30:37] <%Kataguro> Don't say his name!
[0:30:37] <Dhurkst> O LAWD
[0:30:37] <takokasa> Jeepers Creepers would be really nice for this game, but since the creator is a pedophile or something it'll never happen
[0:30:39] <+VidyaFranX> Jeepers Creepers was made by a pedophile, so that's a no no
[0:30:40] <gorillahandz> dont think it dont say it

[0:30:45] <scrumbotime> when he shows up he makes train noises and you can't get a boner
[0:30:46] <%CaptainKarite> Don't think it don't say it!
[0:30:46] <%Agami23> dont think it dont say it

[0:38:40] <+LowBatteryLife> Bill!
[0:38:40] <$Corporate_Redeemer> In the DBD lore there has been survivors how have told the entity to "fuck off" and tried to either fight back or not follow the Entity's rules. The Entity then just deletes the rebellious survivors from existence or turns them into killers.
[0:38:42] <+alextheblight> wow, BM
[0:38:42] <KruelDestiny> wow
[0:38:43] <takokasa> those 3 were 100% together

[0:39:03] <+Chillwind700> Yeah welcome to the dbd community
[0:39:06] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you obviously haven't been part of the higher ranked scene. DbD is toxic as fuck woopsHyper
[0:39:06] <starotter70> ...
[0:39:09] <%AncelDeLambert> but yeah, your chase speed needs to increase MUCH faster while cornering objects
[0:39:11] <takokasa> Ash has been in the game for over a month
[0:39:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Jokes on him thst shit aint confirme

[0:39:25] <%Despera__> Are they talking about hackers?
[0:39:26] <%brickwall35> that's not canon
[0:39:28] <Animal_Farm4> Where the FUCK did they hear that lore?
[0:39:29] <%THATGUY_789> I like that
[0:39:29] <%deviljhojho94> Impressive
[0:39:31] <%Despera__> In lie a 4th wall sense
[0:39:34] <eureka60> baTMAN
[0:39:35] <starotter70> Huh
[0:39:35] <+DukeMoose> Legion? the angsty teen
[0:39:36] <takokasa> The survivors from the original trailer, sans Dwight, I think
[0:39:37] <%Agami23> probably legion
[0:39:37] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh shit that’s rad as hell actually
[0:39:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> wtf is monkaS?
[0:39:39] <emillionghost> idk if thats canon
[0:39:44] <%Agami23> they seem like the type
[0:39:44] <%brickwall35> that's fanfic Paige
[0:39:44] <%AncelDeLambert> no, Legion very definitely was invited
[0:39:45] <+Pyrophant> hit em with the mori, pat
[0:39:47] <%THATGUY_789> get summons. fuck that
[0:39:48] <%thebonebard> 3?
[0:39:52] <%deviljhojho94> monkaS is an emote that you can only see with a twitch gold account
[0:39:53] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh thank god Paige is here. Pat's streams just aren't the same without her.
[0:39:57] <Pookiedaexzile> That should be Ghostfaces back story, like a reference to the movie, he was picked to be a survivor
[0:39:58] <%deviljhojho94> or if you download BBTV Kappa
[0:40:02] <%kiiiirsten> The wiki pages for the killers explains their backstories and why They Do The Thing
[0:40:02] <%THATGUY_789> it's like saying no to jury duty
[0:40:02] <AFlyingTaco1> Kappa
[0:40:04] <+Estuko> @Order_of_Mystery it's an emote. @deviljhojho94 said it, twitch gold
[0:40:10] <$SGrim> 10 isn't high rank. 3 and up is the toxic soup.
[0:40:10] <+Chillwind700> Oh yeah ghostface was leaked
[0:40:13] <+Estuko> @deviljhojho94 Damn it LUL
[0:40:13] <indig0bird> People in the long run would want to give back to the community
[0:40:17] <%Dementedpenguin> Rank reset is a mess. Players of all skills bunched together. LUL
[0:40:22] <DraxTD> BUTT DANCES
[0:40:23] <+alextheblight> yeah, the Entity 'breaks' the killers' minds (the ones that don't follow suit right away, anyhow)
[0:40:27] <+Ace5335> survivors are butts
[0:40:28] <televisedrevolting> @kiiiirsten Cause they're fucked broken people?
[0:40:30] <takokasa> SWFs are rarely nice, but solo queue survivors are generally more chill regardless of rank
[0:40:31] <%deviljhojho94> @Estuko Im a chickenheart what can I say 4Head
[0:40:32] <%DedlokPM> @Animal_Farm4 speculation basically. Some people theorize the personthat they quote a lot in the flavor text become a killer
[0:40:32] <Crankthulhu> There needs to be more than 20 ranks
[0:40:35] <+tigerfang86> BAD AT VIDEO GAMS
[0:40:36] <ChoculaUltra> is Ghostface from Scream a killer yet?
[0:40:41] <DefaultSettiings> Everything is a butt sofieGasp
[0:40:57] <+starzo0> @PeachSaliva i get shit on at any rank just cause i like playing killer
[0:40:57] <DevilDeus13> Tall Man from Phantasm
[0:41:00] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I wasn't accusing you of anything, I just wanted you to know right around where the shit begins. You know, so you can look forward to it.
[0:41:01] <%Dualparadoxes> wraith started out as a pretty okay guy
[0:41:01] <+Estuko> mind breaking huh
[0:41:07] <%DedlokPM> @ChoculaUltra not releaased officially yet. Wasn't even supposed to be on PTS, but a bug made it playable
[0:41:07] <%Kataguro> Entity replace with Cocoon. Entity as a chestburster. It'd be really cool
[0:41:08] <Crankthulhu> Put John Carpenter's The Thing in as a shapeshifting Killer
[0:41:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Reshiram, huh?
[0:41:17] <takokasa> Wraith, Hag, and Spirit literally did nothing wrong
[0:41:17] <InugamiTheHound> so the evil spider god is real in this game?
[0:41:18] <Animal_Farm4> With these two hands now we can monkaS Clap
[0:41:21] <eureka60> MR X
[0:41:21] <+BoomerTiro> Xenomorph merely needs to see The Entity as The Queen and the Hooks as Nest and it will happily hook survivors as meat for The Hive
[0:41:23] <%PlainSimpleTailor> YOOOO! You know who we need? HOME ALONE KID
[0:41:25] <ChoculaUltra> @DedlokPM oh neat
[0:41:27] <%kiiiirsten> Spirit :'(
[0:41:28] <%deviljhojho94> wraith was just an average joe
[0:41:33] <+alextheblight> I imagine she broke Adiris' (the Plague) mind, because she was a benevolent priestess
[0:41:34] <+tigerfang86> say TAN
[0:41:34] <+Rolandknight> what happen to skyrim?
[0:41:38] <%thebonebard> im tellin ya, xenomorph should get chest bursters, timed deaths
[0:41:41] <shackbox> she made a deal with the entity itself
[0:41:44] <+Pyrophant> you should play the plague, cus even if the survivors make it, its not very graceful to get puked on
[0:41:44] <%iwishthiswasicq> JESSICA
[0:41:46] <turf_wind_and_fire> @eureka60 that’s a fantastic idea. Legit.
[0:41:48] <%Cavumentum> I stand by the idea of Gremlins as a mob killer
[0:41:49] <%kiiiirsten> Playing by Until Dawn rules
[0:41:50] <%Kataguro> Put Spoiler from Until Dawn in the game
[0:41:53] <@lewdskeletor13> Until Dawn is sick
[0:41:54] <takokasa> Hag totally ate the people that were trying to eat her
[0:41:54] <+BoomerTiro> Wendigo are canadians
[0:41:55] <ScreamingMeat> A Windigo would be a cool Killer
[0:41:55] <InugamiTheHound> @Rolandknight pat had too many combat mods that made the game to hard
[0:41:55] <%deviljhojho94> half wendigo
[0:41:57] <AFlyingTaco1> @InugamiTheHound Yeah, it's basically the catalyst for the game's setting
[0:41:57] <+DukeMoose> Mmmm, tasty crunchy people
[0:42:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Ah yes the Christan Wendigo
[0:42:02] <SchroedingersFerret> Eloise Cole is a new killer
[0:42:02] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @PeachSaliva Wouldn't the kid from Home Alone be hilarious?
[0:42:09] <+ashes141> Ghostface leak was faked...next killer has been confirmed to be John Cena
[0:42:09] <Animal_Farm4> Pretty sure it was sweet magic vengeance
[0:42:09] <shackbox> the deal was "become a killer to get those bastard"
[0:42:09] <turf_wind_and_fire> Critters or the worms from tremors
[0:42:10] <DefaultSettiings> Pat stopped playing Skyrim cause he couldn't make an account on Loverslab yet
[0:42:11] <+tigerfang86> BIG satan
[0:42:11] <person181> my moneys on c'thulu
[0:42:12] <%THATGUY_789> the Trex from Jurassic Park as a killer
[0:42:13] <Dhurkst> Way higher-tier than satan, I'd say
[0:42:13] <%deviljhojho94> satan is a giant crab
[0:42:14] <@commanderclaw> Crab Satan
[0:42:15] <%NWR_James> S-A-T-A-N

[0:42:18] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[0:42:19] <DracaenaLeaf> nice
[0:42:19] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[0:42:19] <takokasa> The Entity is a pandimensional being like It, which is why the Clown is not It
[0:42:20] <%deviljhojho94> Lul
[0:42:20] <%Kataguro> Unfortunate
[0:42:21] <JoshTheFace> PogChamp
[0:42:21] <%Agami23> oh my god. I just realized the best killer
[0:42:25] <InugamiTheHound> @AFlyingTaco1 so a spider god is real? Do they worship it? I mean the killers?
[0:42:25] <Nina96> is it bug satan?
[0:42:25] <%spiritofmojave> 🦀 Satan
[0:42:26] <AFlyingTaco1> Just immediately launch in there
[0:42:26] <Frostydough> WHOS SACRIFICING
[0:42:26] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat you ready for Jovian concord and ghost booty?
[0:42:27] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Those survivors are Vigo and some other guy. Vigo is mentioned in killer offerings while the other guy is only in survivor offerings. So people theorized that Vigo became a non-playable killer due to him being in killer offerings and the other guy being lost due to having been in the Entity's realm for centuries.
[0:42:28] <+ChaosVulpes> No, the Entity is HIM from Powerpuff girls
[0:42:29] <ChoculaUltra> Chucky? A killer with a small hitbox/model that players will have to look down to see/avoid
[0:42:31] <%DedlokPM> If satan was a giant spider, then yeah
[0:42:31] <@lewdskeletor13> 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
[0:42:31] <%Ragnarok_Flames> why does it have to be judeo christain shite? the entity is eldritch in nature IMO
[0:42:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> The enity is basically mat but he can interact with people
[0:42:35] <%thebonebard> its probably some dead religions satan
[0:42:41] <%anAngryHamster> The Mesopotamian death god Eloiecole
[0:42:42] <rytisone> Blood for the blood god
[0:42:47] <%MegboyManuel> Sorry my story makes you sad
[0:42:48] <%kiiiirsten> Stella got her groove back
[0:42:48] <+alextheblight> I feel sorry for the Nurse
[0:42:50] <+ElizzGlaster> @AngriestPat In some Wendigo myths all it takes is a human eating human flesh to become a Wendigo
[0:42:51] <%Agami23> @PeachSaliva @AngriestPat spawn should be a killer. tricked into thinking the entity is malebogia
[0:42:54] <+tigerfang86> DESTROYED
[0:42:55] <%Kataguro> 2 in like a minute. Shit
[0:42:55] <$SGrim> Yeah, but fuck sprint burst though, so Meg can burn in hell. woopsRage
[0:42:55] <%iwishthiswasicq> You're bothering ME tho
[0:43:01] <%Ragnarok_Flames> the enitity is the demo EloiseCole
[0:43:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Now PAT is BULLY
[0:43:11] <AFlyingTaco1> @InugamiTheHound From what I understand, it's some sort of demonic entity that drags the killers and victims into this nightmare realm to make them suffer
[0:43:14] <%Dualparadoxes> Vigo is mentioned in some of those survivor skins with the glowing goop
[0:43:16] <%MegboyManuel> Everytime Paige mentions Meg, i think she's talking about me :I
[0:43:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Now Pat Big and Strong
[0:43:22] <+tigerfang86> KILL EM ALL PAT
[0:43:26] <%Darthwaffler> The Fratellis from The Goonies for a legion style killer
[0:43:26] <EASrake> This seems like a raw deal for everyone
[0:43:27] <takokasa> Vigo is the only survivor who was able to actually manipulate the entity's realm to an extent where he could create shit
[0:43:27] <%THATGUY_789> that's basically a warp whistle
[0:43:28] <person181> how about eldritch satan
[0:43:28] <@commanderclaw> apatBig Lore Nerds
[0:43:30] <%brickwall35> theories not canon
[0:43:31] <Madbearv> its just a spidee
[0:43:31] <AFlyingTaco1> say TANNN
[0:43:32] <Pallion_> Dead by Daylight has lore?
[0:43:33] <%Kataguro> Bad Juju
[0:43:34] <Animal_Farm4> Why can't it be Eldritch Space Satan?
[0:43:37] <+Chillwind700> Vigo was also a lore focus for the blood plant event last year
[0:43:37] <%maskedriderhero> Satin the Fallen Angle of Dorkness
[0:43:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> culthulu
[0:43:39] <SchroedingersFerret> Stop bullying the survivors Pat BibleThump
[0:43:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> wtf, dead by daylight has lore? and its cool?!
[0:43:48] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Satan gets a bad rao
[0:43:50] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Seriously, does NOBODY else consider the Home Alone kid to be a slasher villain?
[0:43:51] <%Ragnarok_Flames> rap
[0:43:51] <+Pyrophant> i dont like that the survivors are permanently stuck in the entity realm, it feels less rewarding to beat a trial lore-wise
[0:43:52] <%MegboyManuel> Its cool nerd
[0:43:55] <%Kataguro> Wow, fucking RIP
[0:43:56] <KruelDestiny> Clap
[0:43:56] <RollCritFail> The lesson here is Never make a deal with a dark god kids
[0:43:58] <+Estuko> as cool as this game is, that slow down when he swings and lands a blow KILLS ME it feels so off
[0:43:59] <Zereaux> is this lore hour?
[0:44:03] <%Dementedpenguin> uh oh
[0:44:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice hiding spot tho
[0:44:04] <+tigerfang86> he's not that sorry
[0:44:04] <AFlyingTaco1> Pat's dick is just erupting right now goddamn
[0:44:05] <InugamiTheHound> @AFlyingTaco1 alright cool. I wish the game could tell us. I hate hiding lore and you have to look up the wiki stuff
[0:44:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ragnarok_Flames because all the good rappers are angels
[0:44:11] <eureka60> Hannibal??
[0:44:13] <%DedlokPM> @Pallion_ yes in the backstories of the survivors and killers and the flavor text on perks, add-ons, and what-not
[0:44:15] <%THATGUY_789> should be a bacterial infection as a killer
[0:44:17] <%spiritofmojave> Dead by Daylight lore actually seems pretty indepth for being some multiplayer survival game lmao
[0:44:17] <rytisone> Evilak is behind it all
[0:44:19] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko Maybe it's REAL heavy
[0:44:19] <%GabeSweetMan> I didn't even KNOW you could damage the hooks.
[0:44:22] <Enryuan> where does all this lore comes from?
[0:44:25] <juxtest> Vigo from Ghostbusters?
[0:44:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Is that a new addition?
[0:44:30] <%kiiiirsten> @spiritofmojave That was the impression I got on the wiki lmao
[0:44:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Horror Game
[0:44:36] <%Darthwaffler> he is Vigo
[0:44:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Hopelessness
[0:44:39] <%Ragnarok_Flames> pergatory?
[0:44:39] <+Trenr> nah, just kidnapped
[0:44:40] <Zereaux> so limbo
[0:44:41] <%ssjklyco> the entity is producer man, keeping the franchises going to keep making money.
[0:44:42] <Animal_Farm4> The payoff of winning a trial is that you get to hang out near the fire for a while and not be murdered so you get a rest period
[0:44:43] <thelonechris> Technically
[0:44:44] <Zereaux> ?
[0:44:46] <+ChaosVulpes> Purgatory? Limbo? What's the difference?
[0:44:46] <Pookiedaexzile> These things go together
[0:44:46] <%dreampipe332> It's just the Entity being a fuckass, it feeds on fear
[0:44:47] <+Estuko> @kiiiirsten LUL alright I'll go with that
[0:44:47] <%MegboyManuel> Between hell and limbo
[0:44:48] <%Kataguro> Kick Gens
[0:44:49] <%Cavumentum> He's technically correct, the best kind of correct
[0:44:49] <EASrake> Is each match cannon?
[0:44:50] <+Trenr> they got vanned to the spirit world
[0:44:50] <%Toynota10> AHCKSHUALLY
[0:44:51] <%Kataguro> Yeah boy
[0:44:51] <%spiritofmojave> @kiiiirsten I'll have to check it out now, I was sorta sleeping on this before
[0:44:52] <mayorrev> AYKCHUALLY
[0:44:53] <%iwishthiswasicq> Seems pretty hellish to me.
[0:44:54] <Frostydough> WHOS KILLING
[0:44:55] <%thebonebard> dammit now skyrim has me downloading eso online again, i cant wait to be dissapointed by the mmo combat
[0:44:55] <%gsun103> being technically right is the best kind of right
[0:44:56] <+miguelrod777> How is this not hell they fight of killers for eternity
[0:44:59] <@lewdskeletor13> AKCHULY
[0:44:59] <%MegboyManuel> this is the DMV
[0:44:59] <DevilDeus13> Kinda reminds me of A.M. from No Mouth and Must Scream
[0:45:01] <%GabeSweetMan> WHO'S STABBING?
[0:45:03] <callsigneagle01> Eh
[0:45:03] <%Ragnarok_Flames> il puratorio
[0:45:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Hey guys! Guess who's bcak, back again! Guess who's back, back with Bits!
[0:45:06] <+BoomerTiro> Limbotory
[0:45:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Limbotory
[0:45:07] <callsigneagle01> Limbo is kinda different
[0:45:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Limbo is a simi annoying warframe
[0:45:08] <@commanderclaw> Or Ravenloft
[0:45:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Purgbo
[0:45:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> ALSO ASH!
[0:45:12] <+The_Nightmare_Emperor> Explain's Bill's being here
[0:45:12] <%PlainSimpleTailor> OH!! Add Chris Benois to the game
[0:45:13] <Pallion_> So these trials are 'canon'?
[0:45:14] <%JohnnyTubesocks> JohnnyTubesocks subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:45:14] <Dr_Mooose> ash run!
[0:45:15] <+Movemeister> In limbo your back can't take it!
[0:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> WOOOOW
[0:45:15] <Shwepie> @Estuko It sucks, but mechanically it exists to give the survivors a chance to get away.
[0:45:16] <%MegboyManuel> Limbotory is solid
[0:45:17] <prime_name> critroleJester Technically? critroleJester
[0:45:18] <%Kataguro> Nice charge grapple dad
[0:45:21] <Atzros> Poor Ash
[0:45:22] <eureka60> Killer is AM and controls the entire gaME WORLD
[0:45:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Everyone just wants to die.
[0:45:24] <%izaich> purgatory is where those repentant at death go to
[0:45:25] <+Gespens> Purgatory is the path to heaven, limbo is path to hell
[0:45:25] <AFlyingTaco1> Limbo is Warframe's Jojo character
[0:45:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Limbo means you haven't been judged. Purgatory is you're not important enough to judge.
[0:45:27] <%Ninestempest> I thought limbo was you didn't have sins yet cause you were just born, and purgatory was where you went to suffer until you could go to heaven?
[0:45:28] <CalderGaming> Pat Boivin, Hell Expert
[0:45:29] <%spiritofmojave> This is the limbo where the pope sent all the babies
[0:45:29] <%thebonebard> that guy from silent hill 2 should be a survivor
[0:45:32] <callsigneagle01> Like this wouldn't be Purgatory cause Purgatory isn't this bad. It's not great but not nightmarish like this
[0:45:32] <SchroedingersFerret> Limbo is for virtuous pagans and the unborn
[0:45:32] <+imporia_> in hell they wouldn't let you BM the demons
[0:45:33] <%JJCheeker> How dare you attack Ashley slashy
[0:45:34] <turf_wind_and_fire> There’s an ash
[0:45:34] <%Agami23> who's to say this isnt worse than hell?
[0:45:34] <%dreampipe332> I think the Entity is more like it's own super demon that needs these trials to 'feed'
[0:45:37] <Madbearv> well if it was hell then the robot devil would be singing to me
[0:45:37] <%DedlokPM> Hell wouldn't give them a way to escape from the killers
[0:45:41] <%kiiiirsten> LUL where the pope sent all the babies
[0:45:41] <InugamiTheHound> just play Dante's Inferno if you want to know how Hell would look like
[0:45:41] <%izaich> limbo is where people who were virtuous but didn't know christ existed go
[0:45:47] <+ChaosVulpes> And they ran... they ran so far away....
[0:45:47] <Dhurkst> @thebonebard James Sunderland would be great
[0:45:48] <televisedrevolting> Pyramid Head killer?
[0:45:48] <Zereaux> well i think purgatory is where your purged and limbo is where you just get trapped
[0:45:52] <+Chillwind700> Ash I feel like would find a way to fight back
[0:45:55] <+ChaosVulpes> And they ran... they ran all night and day...
[0:45:57] <%izaich> so virtuous pagans go to limbo, repentant sinners go to purgatory
[0:46:00] <callsigneagle01> I mean if you want the IRL lore, Purgatory is just the place you go to wait until the return of Jebus
[0:46:01] <+cahv123> Depends on your def of hell. Limbo is normally just a waiting room until which ever entity who decided these things decides what to do with you.
[0:46:06] <callsigneagle01> It's certainly not bad
[0:46:08] <AFlyingTaco1> Purgatory is literally limbo - your soul/spirit is stuck between the worlds of life and death
[0:46:09] <callsigneagle01> just not heaven
[0:46:13] <Crankthulhu> I wish they'd do a complete rework of Freddy at some point, and bring in Robert Englund to do taunts at Survivors when he attacks
[0:46:17] <+BoomerTiro> Plague?
[0:46:19] <%THATGUY_789> the. gripes
[0:46:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Limbo has been patched out
[0:46:20] <%Ragnarok_Flames> mmmm Meeeeee
[0:46:20] <%iwishthiswasicq> So Limbo is the DMV.
[0:46:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Of the Gripe variety?
[0:46:23] <%kiiiirsten> Eli's in smash? What?
[0:46:27] <%dreampipe332> The Plague = Vommy Mommy
[0:46:29] <%Darthwaffler> We NEED deadite Cheryl to go with Ash!
[0:46:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Save files were corrupted
[0:46:31] <%izaich> those in limbo cannot go to heaven, but those in purgatory can go to heaven
[0:46:31] <+BoomerTiro> I knew there was something sinister behind those cartoons
[0:46:34] <callsigneagle01> @iwishthiswasicq in a way, just not as hellish
[0:46:35] <$SGrim> @BoomerTiro also known as Vommy Mommy woopsHyper
[0:46:39] <%kiiiirsten> LUL how did she not expect that
[0:46:40] <AFlyingTaco1> @iwishthiswasicq Exactly. Just like in Beetlejuice.
[0:46:40] <%Kataguro> And The Purge
[0:46:48] <%dreampipe332> "I want the killer to shit themselves" Said Paige
[0:46:49] <Huntercd> Plague of Gripe? @PeachSaliva
[0:46:49] <callsigneagle01> GOD the purge was stupid
[0:46:51] <%ssjklyco> I like the idea of hell in Lucifer, where anyone can leave at anytime but their guilt keeps them there.
[0:46:53] <%iwishthiswasicq> I would rather be in Limbo than the DMV.
[0:46:56] <+Cafe_Spider> Kirsten Dunst?
[0:46:56] <+imporia_> dante's inferno wise- limbo is at the entrance to hell and the entrance to purgatory is at the center of hell
[0:46:59] <callsigneagle01> Not in a fun way
[0:47:00] <%iwishthiswasicq> Slightly different.
[0:47:01] <+Chillwind700> By the way they said the fixed false chainsaw registers rooREE
[0:47:02] <callsigneagle01> just a bad way
[0:47:04] <juxtest> Pukebeast
[0:47:04] <shackbox> how long until they just add ted bundy
[0:47:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Leigon which looks like the teens from the Purge
[0:47:08] <%Ragnarok_Flames> i fell asleep during The Nun
[0:47:09] <%Toynota10> The NUN!?
[0:47:09] <shackbox> a real ass killer
[0:47:11] <%Darthwaffler> Dirsten Kunst
[0:47:11] <%Kataguro> Free.99
[0:47:12] <+VidyaFranX> The Nun is terrible
[0:47:12] <Pookiedaexzile> No...No it is not
[0:47:18] <%kiiiirsten> Wow...what did you do to her
[0:47:18] <Animal_Farm4> Pat tunnels off hook FeelsBadMan
[0:47:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Nun was just jumpscare city
[0:47:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I saw it theators twice
[0:47:21] <%Laecerelius> so free!
[0:47:22] <DevilDeus13> Awful movie
[0:47:22] <%Ragnarok_Flames> like in the theater
[0:47:23] <exileshadow03> "The Nun is REALLY good" - Paige 2019
[0:47:23] <%PalmtopNami> YIKES
[0:47:24] <ojama1987> what about hte guy from clockwork orange, hes a pshyco right?
[0:47:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Purge has always been "strong premise, zero desire to cash in on the premise beyond DA MURDER."
[0:47:28] <%MegboyManuel> ada wong?
[0:47:31] <EASrake> hot take
[0:47:31] <%thebonebard> i just saw the trailer of the nun and i laughed
[0:47:35] <+G_Thunders> The nun is actually the worst horror movie I’ve seen in a while
[0:47:39] <+VidyaFranX> Did you watch La Llorona, Paige?
[0:47:39] <romanticzomedy> the conjuring was excellent imo
[0:47:40] <callsigneagle01> Nuns are cool
[0:47:42] <%spiritofmojave> Nunts
[0:47:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Brightburn looks cool
[0:47:43] <$RaikenTB> the crappy spinoff movie?
[0:47:44] <%Ragnarok_Flames> its a decent "conjuring universe" movie @PeachSaliva
[0:47:44] <Nina96> i like gun nuns
[0:47:45] <+Pyrophant> doesnt it feel like most of the survivors could just overpower the legion? no way a teenage kid beats a war veteran like bill or bar fight david
[0:47:45] <%GabeSweetMan> WHo'S NUTTING?
[0:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige Loves Nuns
[0:47:45] <%izaich> @importa_ technically purgatory is located on the opposite side of the globe from jerusalem, according to tennyson and dante
[0:47:50] <%nekodelic> just give us Jack Torrance
[0:47:51] <+Chillwind700> I dont
[0:47:52] <televisedrevolting> Pat! Pyramid Head as a Killer. Silent Hill 2 guy as a survivor.
[0:47:54] <%PlainSimpleTailor> How about John McLane for a Killer addition?
[0:47:55] <+BlockingDisabled> I think hell would totally give you a chance to run from the killer... give you a bit of hope just to stick you back in the same situation over and over
[0:47:55] <Hanbei1708> everything's about nuts with you Paige
[0:47:56] <%Dementedpenguin> WELL, this conversation went somewhere
[0:47:56] <%Toynota10> it wasn't TERRIBLE, but it wasn't great either
[0:47:56] <callsigneagle01> Pat that was the Hitman trailer
[0:47:59] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah, fucking sick.
[0:47:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone Draw a Nun Skeleton
[0:48:02] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Any horror game characters you think would fit well?
[0:48:02] <%ssjklyco> We'll have Nun of that.
[0:48:03] <%iwishthiswasicq> Love big titty nun.
[0:48:06] <starotter70> Paige Nun fetish confirmed
[0:48:07] <%izaich> from limbo to bimbos
[0:48:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Imma Draw a Nun skeleton
[0:48:09] <+tigerfang86> large tiddy nun
[0:48:09] <+BoomerTiro> How many people were mad? Nun
[0:48:11] <+Chillwind700> I don’t really care much for horror, but Brightburn is really interesting to me
[0:48:13] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Hey Paige, did you know that dataminers found a full 5-minute long version of the Huntress's lullaby?
[0:48:14] <%Ragnarok_Flames> oooooh La Llorona as a killer
[0:48:16] <%Kataguro> Rip Ada
[0:48:16] <callsigneagle01> God you guys remember that Hitman trailer with the nuns?
[0:48:16] <InkyDraconian> Big calcium nun
[0:48:17] <%thackattack00> big tiddy nuns >
[0:48:20] <AFlyingTaco1> @PeachSaliva did you guys hear about the screening of the Pikachu movie where they accidentally showed La Lorrona? LUL
[0:48:22] <+cahv123> Well if you go by the christian ideology limbo/pergatory is the place where those who didn't pick a side go like philosophers or unborn children. And they just stay there forever. It's exactly between hell and heaven.
[0:48:24] <MissJenniecide> Paige, do you play solo or swf?
[0:48:32] <Huntercd> BDSM big tiddy nun
[0:48:34] <%Agami23> it would never happen, but i'd love Alan from the daisy brown series as a killer.
[0:48:34] <%Order_of_Mystery> ooooh, Jack Torrence would be a great killer lorewise!
[0:48:35] <emillionghost> blind

[0:48:55] <%Kataguro> Ada is fucking dead
[0:48:55] <+Estuko> these nun variations monkaS <3
[0:48:55] <%kiiiirsten> I like her pretty dress
[0:48:57] <televisedrevolting> @inugamithehound Yeah! That guy.
[0:48:59] <%ssjklyco> Paige was nun to pleased with that joke
[0:49:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Hannibal Lectoras a Killer, He can philosophize while he kills
[0:49:05] <callsigneagle01> @cahv123 aye, though in the end they just wait for the return of Christ and everything's cool. So they're not there forever and it gets better in the end
[0:49:17] <callsigneagle01> but yeah this is Hellish right here
[0:49:20] <callsigneagle01> this is ass
[0:49:21] <%SaltyDongs> is that mary jane from the sam raimi spidermAN

[0:49:38] <%THATGUY_789> yeah I can see Pat taken the entity deal
[0:49:38] <%Kataguro> Wow Ash
[0:49:42] <+VidyaFranX> Leprechaun and Chucky should team up and stand on each other's shoulders to be a normal sized killer
[0:49:47] <%Jacobblast> they should make fortnite man the new survivor
[0:49:49] <%GabeSweetMan> PAT 360
[0:49:51] <Madbearv> Ash should be able to fight back

[0:50:23] <+cahv123> Yeah you're right. We're all just waiting around for Big J.
[0:50:23] <%kiiiirsten> Ghostface was the one thing that scared the shit out of me as a kid and my brother would keep a halloween mask above his door tokeep me out of his room
[0:50:28] <+l3sovikk> Is there a killer that can disguise themselves as a survivor?
[0:50:29] <+Agrobaerbel> I kinda want to get this game because it looks cool and some of the killers are awesome like The Pig but is it actually fun to play as a Survivor
[0:50:33] <%iwishthiswasicq> 360 doesn't turn you around Pat.
[0:50:36] <DevilDeus13> Pumpkinhead before Alien
[0:50:38] <%deviljhojho94> i believe it
[0:50:42] <+VidyaFranX> Death Bed is a better movie than the Nun
[0:50:43] <Madbearv> Oh!
[0:50:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Morpheus Orpheus She Sells SeaShells by the Sea Shorepheus
[0:50:46] <thelonechris> They should get Death Spa
[0:50:47] <+trox3d> We've gotta push DeathBed for Summerslam
[0:50:48] <+alextheblight> when I was a kid I called Ghostface "Scary Movie" because I didn't know his name
[0:50:48] <Madbearv> Pumpkin head would be cool
[0:50:50] <+neuwaive> SWF would break that killer
[0:50:51] <televisedrevolting> @pookiedaexzile The Comedian. He sends you to Eric Andre hell.
[0:50:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> They should have Blackula from Scream Blackula Scream
[0:50:54] <DracaenaLeaf> rip ash
[0:50:54] <callsigneagle01> I was saying Skinwalker earlier
[0:50:56] <Decarcassor> What they should have is a Killer with a flippin Stand !
[0:51:00] <ZeeJiggle> Even Legion's trailer kinda made him look like he'd be disguising as a survivor.
[0:51:01] <exileshadow03> Skinwalker
[0:51:08] <%wvuboii> SAME
[0:51:09] <%Darthwaffler> It should have been Evil Dead 1 Ash, every other version of him is too powerful.
[0:51:10] <%Agami23> add Dr.Acula as a killer
[0:51:12] <callsigneagle01> the greatest enemy of /k/, the Skinwalker
[0:51:18] <takokasa> rawr
[0:51:21] <+Pyrophant> plus the pig has zero terror radius when she crouches
[0:51:21] <Animal_Farm4> Black Hair and red Coat? must be Claudettte TriHard
[0:51:23] <Pookiedaexzile> @televisedrevolting See now I'm thinking Watchmen.....that would be a bad time
[0:51:48] <turf_wind_and_fire> Oooh what about a tethered from the movie Us?
[0:51:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 oops, hit enter when i was moving around, ment to add: Don't be a Jerk, and don't be a fool. Be a good neighbor and follow these rules. What are these rules?

[0:52:01] <EASrake> o hai claudette
[0:52:01] <%Kataguro> Spook Zone
[0:52:02] <+cahv123> I'd like Pumpkin head because I loved the first movie as a kid but I'm not sure how'd they put him in. What powers could they give it? It's basically a big demon that you can't keep out and always knows where you are. It would probably be game breaking.
[0:52:03] <takokasa> letoSnekiro
[0:52:10] <%deviljhojho94> FF7 remake coming out in 3 to 5 years
[0:52:12] <%Agami23> actually. fuck. just add a creepy snake killer.
[0:52:13] <ZeeJiggle> You ever on a gen and then look over at the other person doing the gen, but it's not a person it's pig.
[0:52:23] <%spiritofmojave> FF7 releasing 7 episodes across 7 years jermaDafoe
[0:52:23] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The killer that should pretend to be a survivor should've been Ash's Evil/Deadite Clone since it makes so much sense.

[0:52:32] <%deviljhojho94> What a about a gremlin from gremlins? Hitbox issues maybe?
[0:52:34] <Animal_Farm4> Whispers is just the mind goblins telling Pat that he isn't 100%-ing the nearby area for survivors LUL
[0:52:37] <%deviljhojho94> I really loved Gremlins so im biased

[0:57:52] <%spiritofmojave> He yell for elevation

[0:57:59] <+cahv123> Honestly a vampire would be a good choice. They can mimic being a survivor, they're dangerous when you're alone with them, and they have supernatural powers to help find you. Plus there's plenty of lore on their powers so it would be easy to build one.

[0:59:46] <%wvuboii> complain and Im sire Behavior will nerf it...
[0:59:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Projectile cats is a powerful weapon.
[0:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:54] <thelonechris> Good bot
[1:00:01] <callsigneagle01> @mornerboi welcome to Tennessee
[1:00:05] <callsigneagle01> it's actually pretty nice
[1:00:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GabeSweetMan not as powerful as laser cats
[1:00:13] <%GabeSweetMan> True
[1:00:13] <zamzoph> @ManfredA Is that a Junji Ito story? Because it sure sounds like one
[1:00:19] <+DrPoxx> wow this modded skyrim is intense!
[1:00:20] <%mornerboi> @callsigneagle01 That's the scariest part, I actually live just outside Nashville. This is pretty accurate to North Nash tbh.
[1:00:23] <Pookiedaexzile> We are all idiots....Here me out here....ROBOCOP
[1:00:27] <starotter70> Going to bed, night all
[1:00:28] <ManfredA> I don't think so, no. It goes full Mad Max too within like a day
[1:00:31] <ManfredA> tiny Mad Max
[1:00:32] <%Kataguro> Blind
[1:00:33] <%GabeSweetMan> What isn't a Junji Ito story at this point?
[1:00:41] <%GabeSweetMan> That man can make anything terrifying.
[1:00:46] <Huntercd> Hugh hefner?
[1:00:52] <callsigneagle01> @mornerboi I mean I'm in Baton Rouge and this isn't quite as bad
[1:00:52] <coolerthenyou85> Good night @starotter70
[1:00:54] <ManfredA> it's a hole made just for me
[1:00:55] <+RushUnplugged> Robocop can't work, he'd just shoot everyone and then the evil god and just... leave
[1:01:02] <%spiritofmojave> Junji Ito does it all, honestly. Besides a successful animated adaptation
[1:01:03] <%mornerboi> Hahahaha
[1:01:22] <zamzoph> The Junji Ito story about the house foundation is the funniest thing LUL
[1:01:24] <$serpenttucker> I'd love for a swamp monster or fish-man killer
[1:01:25] <callsigneagle01> @mornerboi I guess all you have to do is compare this to RE7 and see which is worse
[1:01:33] <$serpenttucker> That or an evil tree demon or something
[1:01:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Ring around the rosie
[1:01:45] <callsigneagle01> @serpenttucker Aku?
[1:01:47] <Hanbei1708> @zamzoph he got under there don't worry about it
[1:01:47] <Pookiedaexzile> This guy has the moves
[1:01:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> basement
[1:01:57] <+theunforgivingsquid> manbat
[1:01:58] <Decarcassor> @serpenttucker Hag is kind of a swamp monster. :p
[1:01:59] <A_Goblin_Named_Dave> I am not going to say i am bad at this game but i am a Meyers main
[1:02:01] <mayorrev> was that a burp???
[1:02:04] <Pookiedaexzile> The Joker
[1:02:04] <Renkage> Classic decisive
[1:02:06] <%GabeSweetMan> We got some tricky dickies this match.
[1:02:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Mark Hamil version
[1:02:19] <Pookiedaexzile> HE can talk to the Survivors
[1:02:20] <Hanbei1708> i like the one with the centipede scalp dude
[1:02:27] <%mornerboi> @callsigneagle01 I dunno, both are pretty bad. But at least neither one is Kentucky.
[1:02:38] <+PenmanLupine> What happened to Skyrim? did it Crap out?
[1:02:42] <%kiiiirsten> Yes
[1:02:45] <$serpenttucker> @Decarcassor I was think more classic swamp monster that is just a bunch of weeds and mud made up into a monter, though I guess that kinda goes against the idea of using killers in this game.
[1:02:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeah
[1:02:48] <%Dualparadoxes> Too many mods
[1:02:49] <emillionghost> basement time
[1:02:50] <Pookiedaexzile> IT Crapped in
[1:02:51] <callsigneagle01> @mornerboi Kentucky has KFC so it's worst by default hue
[1:02:56] <%spiritofmojave> Too many mods in the stew
[1:02:59] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:03:01] <%GabeSweetMan> All of Pat's Titty Mods broke it.
[1:03:06] <Pookiedaexzile> What about Cujo
[1:03:07] <%mornerboi> @callsigneagle01 huehueuheu
[1:03:09] <Zombrocom> Christ that scream
[1:03:13] <+theunforgivingsquid> professor pyg from Batman vomics
[1:03:21] <Decarcassor> @serpenttucker I get you. But I believe one of the core design idea behind this game is that all killer where once humans.
[1:03:24] <%kiiiirsten> Pat's horse nuts mod made the game go crazy
[1:03:27] <+neuwaive> maybe don't do that since they all have anti tunneling perks
[1:03:29] <%Reaped_Psyche> @PenmanLupine Too many mods. He's going to try again another day with a new install and a more sensible mod load.
[1:03:36] <@lewdskeletor13> Wha Happun to Paige
[1:03:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Cujo gets trained by the Entity to be a good boy and hunt the dumb survivors with his perma rabbies
[1:03:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Professor Pyg freaks me the fuck out man
[1:03:44] <+Puppet88> Ash!? Dwight!??
[1:03:45] <Meekest> Thas a Jake
[1:03:47] <%kiiiirsten> Paige is with The Baby
[1:03:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 eaten by elmo
[1:03:54] <%spacehouse> they need to put in an Opera singer survivor
[1:03:56] <%iwishthiswasicq> Where'd other Pat go?
[1:03:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige is will baby, you can hear baby cry.
[1:03:58] <callsigneagle01> tbh I haven't been to Kentucky
[1:04:04] <frozenottsel> I just got here, is Piage under the blanket?
[1:04:06] <ManfredA> ouch
[1:04:08] <%mornerboi> Back on the hook you go!
[1:04:10] <A_Goblin_Named_Dave> Farmed
[1:04:12] <+theunforgivingsquid> @garbagenirvana me too that's why he is great
[1:04:15] <@lewdskeletor13> @garbagenirvana Easily the freakiest Batman villain
[1:04:16] <ManfredA> billy/bubba's hammers are so brutal
[1:04:18] <%wvuboii> you tunne p
[1:04:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Right where they belong. On the hook.
[1:04:20] <%TG_Cid11> did pat give up on skyrim?
[1:04:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Simple enough but why not put in a Yeti
[1:04:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Or Big Foot
[1:04:27] <Pookiedaexzile> or Swamp Ape
[1:04:38] <Pookiedaexzile> or Yucataw Hair monster
[1:04:40] <callsigneagle01> @mornerboi though memes aside I like most of the places. This place just bites cause half the state population must be retarded
[1:04:44] <$serpenttucker> @Decarcassor could be then that it is the corpse of a man who was murdered by way of drowning in the swamp. I just like the idea of this game having a swamp or water level, and the killer's gimmick is blending into plant or leaf piles around the map, or warping by bodies of water
[1:04:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Skyrim didn't like how big Pat was trying to make the tiddies.
[1:04:50] <@lewdskeletor13> @tg_cid11 He added too many mods and it was borked. Gonna stream it another day
[1:04:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pit in leprechaun or chuckie.
[1:04:57] <Animal_Farm4> I feel like you don't really feel how bad it is to tunnel someone off hook until you play survivor and get farmed off hook
[1:04:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I remember a stream clip from a while back where you two talked about what if Paige just birthed Elmo. I recently remembered that in ES lore, Khajhit can be born in a bunch of different body types, based on moon phase, including: pretty much indistinguishable from wood elves, and: esentially a sapient house cat.
[1:05:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Diversion tactics
[1:05:10] <%mornerboi> Why is pat so good at thinking like a serial killer
[1:05:10] <%orion_248> why no Loch Ness monster?! he could be priced at tree fiddy
[1:05:13] <+tigerfang86> SO destroyed
[1:05:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[1:05:16] <%wvuboii> booooo stop tunnel
[1:05:26] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL They just keep going back
[1:05:36] <Renkage> Not really tunnel when they make it obvious
[1:05:40] <%Dualparadoxes> Dualparadoxes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! I hope that now that the licensed killers are getting some cosmetics, we Myers in the goofy ass sheet ghost costume from Halloween 1
[1:05:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Get back here nerd!
[1:05:45] <Decarcassor> Tunnel is good for you. It helps win games. :p
[1:05:51] <%spiritofmojave> Surely Pat is only a serial literer
[1:05:54] <callsigneagle01> @orion_248 I'm starting to wonder how many people are just repeating that joke and are too old for that era of SP
[1:06:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Feels like there's actual coordination between the survivors here
[1:06:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Do you think that nerd is trying to take you back to the past?
[1:06:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Hear me out 1 more time, The Witch from HAzel and Gretel she leaves Snacks for the Survivors that healand can lead them places againist there will
[1:06:19] <%GabeSweetMan> To play the shitty games that suck ass?
[1:06:28] <%TG_Cid11> is this the plague of gripes 2019 sim?
[1:06:44] <Animal_Farm4> Pat no! 3-gen strats are the path to the darkside BibleThump
[1:06:51] <%mornerboi> @TG_Cid11 This is the most accurate representation of the Tennessee hills I've ever seen. Source: I live there.
[1:06:52] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s Dead by Daylight if you’re actually wondering
[1:06:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TG_Cid11 yes
[1:07:13] <%orion_248> honestly that episode of South park should be mandatory to watch for every decent shi tposter
[1:07:22] <callsigneagle01> It should
[1:07:29] <Decarcassor> I'll tell you what classic killer archetype we don't have yet. A poisoner and an Arsonist.
[1:07:32] <curechan9> does this game any other maps ?
[1:07:33] <televisedrevolting> Imagine if the Psycho Hillbilly could think this far ahead.
[1:07:36] <callsigneagle01> most of early to mid South Park should be mandatory
[1:07:40] <%Kataguro> How unlucky
[1:07:43] <+tigerfang86> oh nooooooo
[1:07:45] <%kiiiirsten> Are those scratches just Survivor Fart Gas
[1:07:46] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[1:07:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Stop him from reviewing bad NES Games!
[1:07:48] <MissJenniecide> OOF, shoulda dropped that pallet lol
[1:07:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Poor unfortunate souuuuuul!
[1:07:48] <%nitsuji94> oooooohhhhhnoooooooo
[1:07:49] <Dr_Mooose> ya hate to see that happen
[1:07:50] <televisedrevolting> @curechan9 Yes actually.
[1:07:51] <Mpgame99> The game has like 10 maps
[1:07:52] <callsigneagle01> "Remember when things used to be fun? "Not really."
[1:07:52] <%AncelDeLambert> So sad, so pure
[1:07:54] <%mornerboi> this feels like pat's actual dialogue as a serial killer tbh
[1:07:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Poor guy
[1:08:05] <%mornerboi> Chainsaw revving as Pat yells 'THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE FOR YOU.'
[1:08:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva sing Poor Unfortunate Soul for us
[1:08:11] <%Dotta5> Hail to the cube
[1:08:12] <bloodypurpledog> I just got here why is Paige a blanket now is she trying to be a muppet
[1:08:16] <@lewdskeletor13> @mornerboi LUL
[1:08:18] <Pookiedaexzile> People where talking Fishmonster what abouut Ursula on land, slopping around singing
[1:08:19] <televisedrevolting> Pat would make an incredibly skilled murder man.
[1:08:20] <%MelBrooksKA> What a shame, what a shame, what a shame...
[1:08:30] <%kiiiirsten> I love watching Pat play Killer but I'm not getting the fear and dread like when waitching Paige LUL
[1:08:35] <RupanSen> "Your next line is... "
[1:08:37] <+RushUnplugged> just put PAT in the game
[1:08:46] <callsigneagle01> "I watched The Passion and Mel Brooks said you're liars and cheats! And if the Road Warrior says it it must be true!"
[1:08:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Well Pat's method of murder wouldn't be so overt.
[1:09:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Guys I’m getting cat cuddles apatGib
[1:09:10] <%AncelDeLambert> god I hate this, they can just waste your time for MINUTES running in circles around the same stack of tires
[1:09:10] <Decarcassor> @curechan9 There are 19 maps I think ? If I'm not miscounting
[1:09:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Who’s ready for scream?
[1:09:13] <televisedrevolting> Pat's fuckin Kira. He has prime real estate in their heads.
[1:09:14] <%GabeSweetMan> His methods would include being in the hiding spots eating candy before you get there.
[1:09:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> he got snoke
[1:09:22] <Pookiedaexzile> I want Jesus as a Killer, Technically he's just sending people to heaven, He didnt want to participate, but he did anyway
[1:09:22] <+cahv123> I'd like to get into this game but I haven't seen a killer that makes me go "I need this in my life" and i'm not interested in being a survivor.
[1:09:23] <curechan9> damn that a lot
[1:09:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, I found you, why wont the game let me catch you
[1:09:26] <%nitsuji94> bummer dude
[1:09:27] <%mornerboi> Pat would kill you by making you binge watch Evangelion and sending you into a depression.
[1:09:36] <callsigneagle01> oh god
[1:09:44] <j0rtz> has pat played as michael myers in this game yet?
[1:09:51] <+RushUnplugged> Drink a delicious, delicious redbull for a speed buff
[1:09:54] <callsigneagle01> @orion_248 Woodland Critters ought to be in this
[1:09:54] <%Kataguro> Coward
[1:09:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Eva is still shit all these years later
[1:10:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Crazy Fat Ethel as a Tank Killer
[1:10:26] <%iwishthiswasicq> See, I desperately want a single player version of this game.
[1:10:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you're making tons of noise, they just have to stay crouched
[1:10:39] <televisedrevolting> Has anyone drawn Hillbilly just riding on top of his chainsaw.
[1:10:48] <%iwishthiswasicq> Because the game has to make it fair for the survivors because it's actual people.
[1:10:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat got out-yomid
[1:10:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Dang they juked you good.
[1:10:57] <%brickwall35> bad play
[1:10:58] <%iwishthiswasicq> But if it's single player, fuck em.
[1:10:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @televisedrevolting like Nero on his arm?
[1:11:04] <MissJenniecide> not sure why they bothered healing but alright

[1:12:03] <%DedlokPM> @rossnwolf Overmodded into oblivion. And no, not the Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Just regular oblivion
[1:12:07] <Mpgame99> BBQ shows you where the survivors are after you hook someone
[1:12:10] <Decarcassor> @AngriestPat I'm on my 3rd page of perks for the plague I still haven't got it.
[1:12:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh that is useful
[1:12:15] <Animal_Farm4> But monitor and abuse is worthless on Hillbilly because you can hear his chainsaw anyway
[1:12:18] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Use monitor and Abuse with add-ons that make your chainsaw quieter
[1:12:19] <%deviljhojho94> Just get the perk 4Head

[1:13:15] <xxshadowxx416> xbox is going
[1:13:15] <Renkage> Are Survivors always dicks? They seem like dicks 9 times outta 10
[1:13:19] <+PenmanLupine> Skyrim collapsed under the weight of all o of its mods I think
[1:13:26] <%sshen> So is E3 now just only devolvers shitposting
[1:13:29] <+VashyronM> Classic
[1:13:31] <callsigneagle01> @spiritofmojave I don't even care too much for Devolver tbh

[1:14:02] <%Kataguro> I love Barret's new voice. I want him to help me take that load off
[1:14:03] <%spiritofmojave> Then again Xbox might announce something worthwhile, maybe. Or just Forza city
[1:14:03] <Pookiedaexzile> I want Scalebound to comeback so I can play it while I look at DMCV and say "Yeah, you like that, You're not enough to satify me any more"
[1:14:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Chief Irons did ALOT wrong
[1:14:06] <%Mornaka> he was totally Mr T in my head

[1:14:14] <+TONYOO101> did pat ever figure out what drip really means, or is woolie's lie still in effect?

[1:15:50] <%Mornaka> that's odd
[1:15:52] <hntronium> Pat is always Billy
[1:15:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> @DraxTD PAT
[1:15:54] <callsigneagle01> Like there's nothing
[1:16:00] <callsigneagle01> The West has nothing now
[1:16:02] <frozenottsel> I want Reach on PC sooner than later
[1:16:02] <callsigneagle01> what happened
[1:16:05] <%Kataguro> What a bunch of assholes
[1:16:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> yeah, that new battlefield looked like the same crap dice have been doing for years. they should try and mix it up or take a break from battlefield
[1:16:13] <StrayShep> this map seems amazing for survivors to hide in
[1:16:13] <Pallion_> Time For Crab
[1:16:15] <DraxTD> @Kirby_Sauce well YEAH, but I meant what other monster was he RPing
[1:16:16] <Amardeux> sacrificing their friends for less time on the clock
[1:16:26] <Dhurkst> @callsigneagle01 Western gaming is far from dead. Some companies are shooting themselves in the foot, but far from all of them.
[1:16:28] <Decarcassor> @Darthwaffler Every map is the worst map in the game.
[1:16:39] <callsigneagle01> @Order_of_Mystery fuck it, bring back Medal of Honor
[1:16:48] <DraxTD> ring around the rosy
[1:16:52] <callsigneagle01> and maybe not ruin it with all the bullshit like they did Wolfenstein II
[1:16:53] <CeeDee__> that was a nice try
[1:16:53] <frozenottsel> nice try meg
[1:16:57] <MissJenniecide> woah, she was surprisingly hidden in those reeds tho
[1:17:04] <+kenpachi15> @kenpachi15 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:17:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> @DraxTD Texas Chainsaw PATsacer
[1:17:12] <$SGrim> There was an attempt woopsWoo
[1:17:13] <+VashyronM> deez nutz
[1:17:14] <j0rtz> yeah?
[1:17:14] <AFlyingTaco1> @callsigneagle01 RAge 2 comes out next week, Borderlands 3 later this year, DOOM Eternal probably next year. I wouldn't call that "dead".
[1:17:19] <+d00msdaydan> RIP AND TEAR YOUR NUTS
[1:17:20] <%deviljhojho94> YOU ARE HuGE, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE NUTS
[1:17:39] <%Darthwaffler> @Decarcassor Me and my friends like Blumpkin Lane and the Red Forest maps.
[1:17:42] <%deviljhojho94> Any of you guys planning on getting rage 2?
[1:17:46] <zamzoph> THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS
[1:17:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AFlyingTaco1 Plus pokemon, and lethal league is coming to switch
[1:17:48] <callsigneagle01> @AFlyingTaco1 I don't think very many people care about Rage and Borderlands has already gotten into rough waters
[1:17:53] <callsigneagle01> DOOM looks sick tho
[1:17:54] <%sshen> BL3 would be a day 1 buy if not for Randy bobandy
[1:17:58] <callsigneagle01> I'll admit that
[1:18:02] <j0rtz> lmao
[1:18:07] <TheHeroAppears> lets hope none of them have hiv since they are all taking turns on the same hook
[1:18:07] <frozenottsel> poor thing
[1:18:11] <%Zamorouskiwhich> LUL Strats
[1:18:16] <%spiritofmojave> I'll get Doom for sure when that comes out, Rage 2 looks like it might be alright not sure I"ll buy it on release
[1:18:19] <%Agami23> I looked away for a second. did paige go to sleep?
[1:18:32] <AFlyingTaco1> Nah, all these minor Borderlands 3 controversies aren't gonna stop that game from selling millions.
[1:18:33] <callsigneagle01> fuck what else is coming out?
[1:18:37] <Decarcassor> @Darthwaffler Lampkin is the worst because of the house windows loops and tight alley. Red forst is the worst because its too big and there are too many pallets. See ? :)
[1:18:49] <callsigneagle01> I mean... ARMA had some DLC come out... fucken what else
[1:18:56] <%deviljhojho94> Rage 2 looks like a good time tbh
[1:18:58] <Dhurkst> @Agami23 Elmo got SUPER needy, so she went off to take care of him
[1:19:02] <%deviljhojho94> I might give it a shot

[1:20:04] <%sshen> Lol EA games
[1:20:15] <omen_setter> i tried to do the lady filter and all it did was give me some makeup
[1:20:15] <callsigneagle01> So far Star Wars Fallen Order looks pretty legit, I'll give it to that.
[1:20:18] <+tigerfang86> remember when stabler shot that guy
[1:20:19] <callsigneagle01> That one might be pretty good
[1:20:20] <%spiritofmojave> hell yeah
[1:20:22] <%PharosOfLight> @AngriestPat have you been watching Happy? it's basically Stabler unhinged and also a unicorn
[1:20:25] <%Mornaka> he does do crimes sometimes
[1:20:34] <%Darthwaffler> @Decarcassor I like the Red Forest because that's my girl Puff Puff AKA the Huntress's level.

[1:21:11] <%kewlmyc> nice jukes from that dude
[1:21:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[1:21:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> I wish "Bad Cop" and "Dirty Cop" had the same connotation as "Bad Dragon" and "Dirty Boy". we need to bring back villiage people sttyle-cop costumes
[1:21:25] <%GabeSweetMan> BUt Paige he loves DA Morder
[1:21:26] <Decarcassor> @Darthwaffler Huntress is sool. But still. Worst map in the game, just like every other map. :)
[1:21:26] <%Kataguro> It is very cool. But dead survivors are cooler
[1:21:28] <SchroedingersFerret> I can't wait to see Loqueesha.
[1:21:34] <callsigneagle01> @Order_of_Mystery I hate to admit that I'm hyped for Fallen Order after all the shit SW we've gotten for so long
[1:21:36] <+theunforgivingsquid> Horatio Cain from csi Miami torture and kills
[1:21:38] <callsigneagle01> but I want it to work
[1:21:39] <televisedrevolting> Oh, Chainsaw-senpai how can you be so flippant, yet so desirable?

[1:21:55] <%AncelDeLambert> the hospital is AWFUL
[1:21:56] <+GiantsKnife> meat plant is rad
[1:21:56] <MissJenniecide> meat plant worst plant
[1:22:04] <Meekest> Haddonfield is worst map
[1:22:05] <Decarcassor> @Paige All maps are the worst map in the game. Thats just the truth.
[1:22:06] <%AncelDeLambert> but yeah, meat plant is HELL for a trapper
[1:22:08] <curechan9> pat going too choke
[1:22:11] <SpaceGuntank> the meat plant SUCKS
[1:22:20] <+VidyaFranX> Haddonfield is the worst. You are all wrong
[1:22:21] <%AncelDeLambert> at least the hospital has windows
[1:22:24] <MissJenniecide> i have strong negative feelings towards haddonfield, but meat plant is by far the worst
[1:22:27] <callsigneagle01> Man we're far from the days of LucasArts
[1:22:28] <%GabeSweetMan> The worst map is the map I just lost on. The best map is the one I just crushed most recently.
[1:22:39] <callsigneagle01> Chat quick what's the best Lucas Arts game?
[1:22:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> @kiiiirsten I'm a jojo and Queen fan. I require a minimum amount of homoerotic undertones in my daily life.
[1:22:49] <callsigneagle01> and why is it Secret Weapons Over Normandy?
[1:22:50] <%Darthwaffler> I love Puff Puff The Huntress!
[1:22:50] <%sshen> Empire at War
[1:22:51] <%dreampipe332> Meat Plant and the Institution are both pretty strong for Killers
[1:22:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Paige how do you feel about Scream being the next killer?
[1:22:57] <nobody12349> The best map is Higgens Haven
[1:23:07] <+VidyaFranX> Meat Plant has tons of safe pallets though
[1:23:08] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S how you use it
[1:23:09] <MissJenniecide> no dodge david

[1:41:41] <ShichiNoBushi> You kind of predicted this in an SBFcast episode where you suggested a hypothetical of if Rooster Teeth bought you out.
[1:41:48] <+kj_Clayface> @AngriestPat YEAH BLOODBORNE IS THE BEST, YOU KNOW IT
[1:41:50] <Decarcassor> Bloodborne is the shit.
[1:41:56] <$RaikenTB> I just beat Sekiro. That last boss is godlike Kreygasm
[1:41:57] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Does this mean Rooster Teeth supports you and Paige's pregnant woman punching or is that just a hobby?
[1:41:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Bloodborne is still the best feeling control-wise to me.
