[0:03:34] <%SovPho> high rank in rise is pretty barebones anyways
[0:03:35] <%donell324> I think my worst mind goblin came from Dead Island because I would only use the character's knife throwing skill to kill the big zombies and that stopped me from continuing the game
[0:03:40] <SlippedDisco> @DashXero that'd be pretty spicy ngl
[0:03:43] <%zeroarturia> I hope for cross save
[0:03:44] <%tigerfang86> THank the Peepo

[0:13:08] <%tigerfang86> Kiryu and Yagami are like, reactive characters
[0:13:09] <RushUnplugged> or they force him to get complete facial surgery and just replace him
[0:13:10] <%Monkeyweed21> I hope they treat Yagami like the 1.0 Warriors of Light
[0:13:15] <%mighty_max_t> I mean, at least Kiryu is DEFINED by his boring-ness. Yagami was just kinda 'a cool detective guy'
[0:13:19] <Joem1k> This reminds me of that one psa where the dad walks in and he's like "where did you learn to do this stuff?!" and then the kid says "i learned it from watching you!"
[0:13:23] <%megadblitz> the world is so not boring that it makes kiryu and Yagami look interesting

[0:32:09] <brachydios777> FRAUD DETECTED
[0:32:10] <%tank7013> This has big "Hacker voice: I'm in" energy
[0:32:10] <%baka_sugoi> thats why 9 buttons LUL
[0:32:11] <CatRidder> says woolie
[0:32:19] <%coward_man> so he forces the other player to switch to wifi
[0:32:24] <huskarl_zap> how is that possible on anything but a pc
[0:32:25] <ShawnEXE> This feels a little tone deaf considering the state of VF netcode
[0:32:28] <%tigerfang86> EVIL MENTOR

[0:33:00] <GeltonZ> Evil Professor rigging a fighting game tournament? This game is gold.
[0:33:01] <+superchronicc> do we know who this "Professor" is?
[0:33:02] <%Monkeyweed21> what if the professor is Ranpo or some shit

[0:33:12] <devanmuse> i mean... do we know that he isn't actually a professor?
[0:33:13] <ShawnEXE> Does this high school have a palace
[0:33:14] <%kewlmyc> This Ace Attorney ass music

[0:33:35] <%Monkeyweed21> no its Ranpo
[0:33:35] <%bigboyeggo> so she's creating her own mysteries to solve?

[0:33:38] <%MauriceFaurron> Nani ? D:
[0:33:38] <Teras_ode> the smart girl?
[0:33:40] <Treasure_Vault> He's actually a neutral professor. This is to offset all the good he does in other places.

[0:44:19] <%thedankestmeeme> looks just like we last saw it
[0:44:29] <@Ranryu692> maybe that's just because Y7 was a jumping-in point, rather than the 78th Kiryu story

[0:58:04] <%bevyrage> it apparently puts you into an infinite loop once you finish the minigame and resets the progress
[0:58:06] <AstrodropGaming> So basically, don't kill any time with sidequests. Just walk around a little bit
[0:58:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> Joel liked it i think
[0:58:19] <%Alazull> It's okay
[0:58:20] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like that fons game bombed
[0:58:21] <mrblitzstream> thats dope
[0:58:22] <acridpaladin> its ok from what ive seen
[0:58:26] <%Axellogic> I know JSS loved it
[0:58:27] <mrblitzstream> gonna look into that
[0:58:27] <%Daxalog> I heard no one talk about it. Outside of shaking drinks
[0:58:29] <%Taisuru> It's okay
[0:58:29] <%bevyrage> it's only a problem with clubs with minigames in it, other sidequests like solving crimes throughout the city are fine
[0:58:30] <$Futurecity10> The Dance Dance minigame is fun
[0:58:31] <%UberKingKai> It is ok
[0:58:33] <Jnkolm> Mine just froze during the victory animation after I won. Looked it up and it's happened to other people
[0:58:34] <Jetsfantasy> It's good, I really enjoyed it as a big FotNS fan. It introduced me to Yakuza
[0:58:35] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt its good, just dont go for 100%
[0:58:36] <Blank9> it's ok
[0:58:40] <%Axellogic> James Stephanie Sterling
[0:58:43] <+Matantara> Jupiter Super Soldier
[0:58:47] <+xerotwo> It's decent
[0:58:48] <%Alazull> It's got a lot of ffun bits but wears old fast
[0:58:50] <T_Sasquatch> Jet Stream Sam
[0:58:51] <%GhoulishCripple> it's okay, I didn't like the minigames all that much. the Combat and story are fine. so is the overworked driving
[0:58:53] <Jnkolm> had nothing to do with the Kill Time thing
[0:58:54] <devanmuse> "JSS" is that a Sawcon?
[0:58:56] <draca23> the FOTNS game is great!....side stuff is so-so
[0:58:58] <+JustToWatch> ULTIMATE BARRIER
[0:58:59] <%GhoulishCripple> the Doctor minigame was awful
[0:59:00] <ursusbearrammage> its really good if you're already a fan of FOTNS
[0:59:00] <%zanz_san> The FotNS he gives Ken more personality then the manga
[0:59:02] <%Nekros4442> thats some 40$ rice
[0:59:07] <%donell324> It is a fun game and the finishers are dope
[0:59:07] <+ekodrop> matsutake mushrooms are hella expensive
[0:59:07] <%bevyrage> meat and mushroom rice is prety filling
[0:59:09] <$Futurecity10> ye
[0:59:13] <@Ranryu692> is that a thing you can do?
[0:59:13] <Jetsfantasy> Sure
[0:59:14] <Sir_Yiffsalot> yes
[0:59:18] <enerkaizer> nah, stay kenshiro
[0:59:18] <%notsoy> but kiryu doesn't kill people, while kenshiro violently slaughters them
[0:59:18] <Teras_ode> was that bakamitai on the background just now?
[0:59:19] <mrblitzstream> @Nekros4442 part 6 & 7 would be goofy to
[0:59:19] <brachydios777> yes
[0:59:20] <AstrodropGaming> An animation from that FoTNS game gets re-used in this game crystaLUL
[0:59:20] <+Tucker0603> which game.
[0:59:22] <@Ranryu692> nice
[0:59:23] <%Garthunox> yes
[0:59:24] <Jnkolm> Lost Paradise is sick. It makes up for all the not killing Kiryu does in Yakuza
[0:59:25] <+Some_DOOD> Wait was that place playing baka mitai?
[0:59:27] <@Ranryu692> ah
[0:59:34] <Blank9> you're already totally nonlethally beat up
[0:59:34] <%baka_sugoi> Kiryu of the north star
[0:59:37] <@Ranryu692> nice
[0:59:41] <Jetsfantasy> It'd be funny to see Kiryu redirect arrows with vacuum fist
[0:59:43] <+xerotwo> Sure i guess kappa
[0:59:45] <+xerotwo> Kappa
[0:59:50] <+SilverDevilfish> The voice fits Kenshiro perfectly though
[0:59:50] <%redthebaron> that seems great
[0:59:52] <%Garthunox> its like 3 bucks
[0:59:53] <Sir_Yiffsalot> and you kill people
[0:59:53] <Teras_ode> but does he kill anyone tho? Kappa
[0:59:57] <malamepos> Isnt it like literally you are wearing his skin
[0:59:58] <+SilverDevilfish> Because Kiryu is just Kenshiro
[0:59:58] <enerkaizer> Kiryu actually killing in the FotN game
[1:00:00] <Sir_Yiffsalot> like legit kill
[1:00:02] <%tigerfang86> noooooooo
[1:00:08] <haitakaa> judgement delayed

[1:00:09] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin week
[1:00:12] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt It wouldd be a perfect game to just kinda show off the sidequests and beeline through the main game
[1:00:13] <%GhoulishCripple> seeing Kiryu pop fleamen like balloons would be fun
[1:00:16] <@Ranryu692> you're not finishing Mass Effect next week with it only scheduled on one day

[1:02:15] <%Garthunox> pat i feel the pop offs for this game will be worth it to continue streaming it
[1:02:21] <@Ranryu692> I was just trying to remember who Yu Suzuki was
[1:02:31] <%X2Eliah> Any relation to Suzuki 4x4 the adorable japanese jeep?
[1:02:53] <%tigerfang86> that's a LITTLE WILD
[1:02:59] <%baka_sugoi> i forgot about this cuz SCHOOL STUFF
[1:02:59] <%tigerfang86> yeah that's NOT GREAT
[1:03:00] <OldManDeckardCain> eh, it happens
[1:03:02] <%faintsmile> you better have proof LUL
[1:03:06] <%tank7013> Is the mastermind of this plot Tokihiro Naboshi?
[1:03:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Yagami has taken a WILD swing
[1:03:11] <Treasure_Vault> just shaking the tree
[1:03:13] <%notsoy> he only has the fact that the last conspiracy he unraveled was even crazier
[1:03:13] <%Nekros4442> It is but you need to grasp for an explanation for a person being in 2 places at the same time
[1:03:14] <devanmuse> Phoenix Wright wouldn't take this bluff
[1:03:16] <%Fooguwu> i mean, it's a good theory
[1:03:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> Sometimes you gotta shake the tree etc etc
[1:03:24] <asurite_warrior> I mean he needs to pull some strings
[1:03:32] <AngryAsian5> [X] Doubt
[1:03:33] <Blank9> gut feelings for a private detective are NEVER wrong
[1:03:44] <%X2Eliah> everyone was having sex with everyone
[1:03:47] <%Maids4lyfe> never
[1:03:56] <%DashXero> Wait... Was SHE bullied?
[1:03:59] <AstrodropGaming> Yagami's digging in real hard on this lady and I'm not sure its a good idea
[1:04:03] <%Mr_Pylon> Yagami's Drama stat is blowing up
[1:04:08] <%Mattais88> The Whole collage class
[1:04:08] <Jnkolm> The accusation isn't super duper nuts but just dropping it so bluntly is a bit much
[1:04:10] <%tigerfang86> ETERNAL BULLYING
[1:04:24] <OldManDeckardCain> yagami, you will never get a commendation unless you start yelling at this woman
[1:04:26] <%Movemeister> Bullying loop
[1:04:31] <+london_flexing> We already in MGTOW terrain
[1:04:39] <asurite_warrior> Its probably a super common occurrence
[1:04:52] <%baka_sugoi> COLLUSION sbfpSetIn
[1:05:09] <%Piemono> Only Cops need proof
[1:05:15] <@Ranryu692> his only proof is that their story has holes in it
[1:05:20] <%Piemono> And not even them sometimes
[1:05:24] <asurite_warrior> I mean he needs to throw something out
[1:05:24] <OldManDeckardCain> getting closer to that commendation eh
[1:05:31] <%tigerfang86> nice joker masks
[1:05:38] <+Matantara> yeah it took atleast 3 dudes
[1:05:38] <+vaderxyz1970> You know to make a murderer is a good documentary
[1:05:50] <lyzejag> Sussy
[1:05:54] <%Maids4lyfe> that reminds me of this VN about bullying and how a class room of children were infected by a bullying virus from a ghost, but to keep it from spreading to other students, a different ghost spooks a bus driver into driving off a cliff to get rid of all the bully-infected kids
[1:05:58] <Sulfur_Boride> I have to almost, in a way, respect the level of commitment it takes to purposefully tank your own reputation for an alibi.
[1:06:00] <%baka_sugoi> I NEED THE TRUFF
[1:06:03] <%SinnerEbru> we're doing main quest stuff again?
[1:06:14] <r0dneyjenkins> gasp
[1:06:19] <%bevyrage> gotta bully her into giving up the bullies
[1:06:20] <%Fooguwu> damn yagami, going hard
[1:06:21] <%faintsmile> @Maids4lyfe are you fucking serious
[1:06:25] <Saltmeisterr> jesus yagami
[1:06:29] <%tigerfang86> yeah that's some BIG badgering
[1:06:29] <+Mrbaconator> he probably has done the arch of honor
[1:06:29] <Sir_Yiffsalot> Its a good thing that room was empty
[1:06:30] <%Mattais88> Was going to say: What Authority?
[1:06:31] <lyzejag> He sound so fucking angry holy shit
[1:06:36] <%bigboyeggo> @Maids4lyfe I'M SORRY WHAT?
[1:06:36] <r0dneyjenkins> man has no ass
[1:06:36] <DSD24> A suit?
[1:06:39] <%Maids4lyfe> 100% serious @faintsmile
[1:06:40] <@Ranryu692> I hate his jeggings
[1:06:42] <@Ranryu692> a lot
[1:06:44] <%notsoy> couldn't he wear a grey suit and wine red shirt?
[1:06:44] <%Taisuru> You're just jealous
[1:06:45] <%DashXero> Yeah. It's not a nice outfit.
[1:06:45] <%thedankestmeeme> have a good meeting
[1:06:46] <OldManDeckardCain> it's a "hello fellow kids" kinda outfit
[1:06:46] <%Dopamien> the chain is practical COPIUM
[1:06:46] <lyzejag> Negative Ass
[1:06:47] <CatRidder> he is a lawyer he can do what ever he wants
[1:06:47] <%Monkeyweed21> NO HE NEEDS TO KILL CHAOS
[1:06:48] <%castlerock42> Or close the jacket.
[1:06:48] <DianaTheAscian> its the pants
[1:06:48] <enerkaizer> yagami not having fashion sense makes sense if the other main character was kiryu
[1:06:49] <@ssjklyco> Lose the wallet chain, and it fixxes it
[1:06:49] <deviljhojho_> perhaps
[1:06:50] <Jnkolm> He's the advisor to the MRC. He has ALL the authority
[1:06:53] <%baka_sugoi> too tight
[1:06:53] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt The chain is what really puts it over for me
[1:06:55] <mrblitzstream> @PatStaresAt i mean he is at the bottom so the only way is UP
[1:07:00] <GeltonZ> Yagami is a secret Kyo cosplayer.
[1:07:01] <%thedankestmeeme> bro the fit is clean
[1:07:01] <brachydios777> he thinks its cool
[1:07:02] <%Maids4lyfe> @bigboyeggo it was from the creator of Higurashi
[1:07:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT HES SO COOL PAT
[1:07:09] <%tank7013> I feel like he would be mostly fine if the jacket was just slightly longer
[1:07:26] <%bigboyeggo> @Maids4lyfe ahhhh that explains everything lmao
[1:07:27] <%zanz_san> His costume is a Yusaku Matsuda reference

[1:11:15] <lyzejag> FINNALLY PLEASE
[1:11:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> i would absolutely love Saori as a main character
[1:11:17] <%MashinChaserR> *haruka
[1:11:18] <%SinnerEbru> im worried japan wouldnt be cool with that
[1:11:20] <OldManDeckardCain> I doubt it
[1:11:22] <lyzejag> It's been like 9 years since Yakuza 5
[1:11:23] <%baka_sugoi> press up d pad
[1:11:23] <%notsoy> the second best time was haruka, but that boat has sailed
[1:11:24] <Sir_Yiffsalot> do a goofy pose
[1:11:25] <Sulfur_Boride> But would all the bosses be women?
[1:11:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> o feel like that would open up some stuff
[1:11:34] <+kingmemelord97> nah
[1:11:35] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:11:35] <%baka_sugoi> all are
[1:11:37] <%UberKingKai> Haruka doesnt count
[1:11:38] <T_Sasquatch> Never happening , these games require combat or they won't sell LUL
[1:11:38] <+Mrbaconator> give us that woman from yakuza 0 who teaches you beast style i don't care if that was in the 80s do it tho
[1:11:39] <Sir_Yiffsalot> hahaha
[1:11:39] <SaltyAzteca> Strain smile
[1:11:40] <DSD24> She's cute
[1:11:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> I love it
[1:11:41] <Teras_ode> :)
[1:11:43] <Sulfur_Boride> She doesn't seem like an expressive person herself
[1:11:43] <@Ranryu692> he looks so unhappy xD
[1:11:44] <devanmuse> She does not look or sound like the person who would take smiling selfies
[1:11:44] <%redthebaron> me and baby
[1:11:44] <scrumbotime> She hasn't Awakened To Battle yet
[1:11:45] <enerkaizer> I only doubt we'll ever get a female lead because japan has very heavy restrictions in terms of violence and women, hence why Poison is who she is for example
[1:11:45] <Jnkolm> But they already Cowarded out from giving us Haruka
[1:11:46] <%MidnightBurst12> :)
[1:11:47] <mrblitzstream> LOOK AT THAT SHIT EATING GRIN
[1:12:08] <%baka_sugoi> DUDES
[1:12:08] <Sir_Yiffsalot> its am expression of pain
[1:12:10] <%Taisuru> But then how will the japanese men self insert themselves into the dating scenes?
[1:12:12] <%silvery_cricket> Mystery Girl should be the protag of the next game, graduate from highschool and solve a No Country For Old Men style murder.
[1:12:12] <AstrodropGaming> Its a nice dream to have
[1:12:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> give us kick girl
[1:12:16] <%baka_sugoi> too many DUDES
[1:12:20] <+SilverDevilfish> I wonder how many people don't get the Bar Tender joke
[1:12:21] <Dunmarkh> @enerkaizer explain taimanin asagi
[1:12:24] <deviljhojho_> makes me think
[1:12:26] <%tank7013> Aren't there multiple Manga of women beating the shit out of each other in like MMA fights?
[1:12:28] <%tigerfang86> a lady detective would blow up basically any Yakuza goon
[1:12:30] <zerointelligence000> The director said he just doesn't want his main character hitting women so would he be down with his villains hitting a woman protag?
[1:12:31] <%tigerfang86> by just talking
[1:12:32] <lyzejag> @SilverDevilfish HOLY SHIT DUDE
[1:12:33] <%baka_sugoi> BAR
[1:12:37] <%MightyDuckShoes> You could be the Hostess and have to manage the guys coming through the door. And if they get uppity and vile you can Beast Mode them through some tables
[1:12:40] <T_Sasquatch> Considering you have female party members in like a dragon i don't know if they get hit
[1:12:43] <devanmuse> At least, with this sequence in the game, we can mod Yagami's moveset onto Saori's model
[1:12:48] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a run? DansGame
[1:12:49] <@Ranryu692> I was thinking bar tender like chicken tenders xD
[1:12:50] <%bigboyeggo> ...i don't get it
[1:12:53] <%MashinChaserR> what's the joke
[1:12:55] <MasterTonberry23> @zerointelligence000 it was okay in yakuza 7 with saeko
[1:12:58] <deviljhojho_> the MC stance
[1:13:00] <enerkaizer> @Dunmarkh its a hentai, and their online game has toned down the violence severly. we're talking here about mainstream type games
[1:13:01] <%MidnightBurst12> look at her go
[1:13:02] <DianaTheAscian> YES
[1:13:02] <%silvery_cricket> A woman does not run Pat - JAPAN 101
[1:13:07] <%tank7013> She might be
[1:13:07] <DSD24> Its a Bar but its Tender
[1:13:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> i don't think nagoshi would allow it
[1:13:10] <%redthebaron> she is already ready
[1:13:12] <%notsoy> i mean, they recycled walk cycles for 3 characters, what's 4?
[1:13:13] <BisoromiBear> Chad stride
[1:13:14] <Blank9> saeko in 7 ran around alongside you
[1:13:14] <%tigerfang86> this is how you walk when you're a main character
[1:13:15] <MayShip> too much swagger
[1:13:15] <Sir_Yiffsalot> Thats the chad stride
[1:13:17] <%baka_sugoi> The best parts about to come up guys get READY woolieGASM
[1:13:18] <+Das_Prints> @zerointelligence000 I mean it happens with Yakuza 7 when you get into fights with Saiko and Eri in your party.
[1:13:19] <%MightyDuckShoes> it's Vince McMahon on a wig
[1:13:23] <kikoeru_san> yeah, she's walking like she's got a package
[1:13:23] <AstrodropGaming> To say you play as Saori is.. an exaggeration

[1:15:19] <IzanagiNoOokami> Put Kaito in the Hostess Dress.
[1:15:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> so there's hope
[1:15:30] <@Ranryu692> I refuse to believe she wouldn't look better for using some conditioner

[1:48:05] <%greasypete00> yagami? why would you say that?
[1:48:05] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:48:08] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What of you're some sort of creepy weirdo?
[1:48:09] <%baka_sugoi> he is right
[1:48:14] <AllenDeadman> fair enough
[1:48:14] <radregice> chairman seems like an okay guy
[1:48:20] <+cubbywolf> call the police then
[1:48:29] <+Chronobot> would'nt you trust the man helping all these KEEEDS
[1:48:32] <+cubbywolf> don't give away employee numbers
[1:48:33] <Blank9> this chairman barely knows yagami
[1:48:44] <@Ranryu692> then the principal shouldn't be giving out people's home addresses to strangers without permission
[1:48:52] <Blank9> he's a secondary detective who busted into the people he hired and decided to be a school consultant
[1:48:52] <%castlerock42> Yagami just plays fast and loose with any info he gets.
[1:48:56] <albedo455> is DIO in this?
[1:49:04] <devanmuse> Devil's Proof, bitch!
[1:49:05] <T_Sasquatch> Yea I'll let you beat up children in my school but i can't give you this chicks address

[1:49:23] <%moonmintparadise> Pat, you would make a horrible detective, but a great smartass in court
[1:49:32] <brachydios777> No you did not, sir
[1:49:49] <@Ranryu692> it would be funny if Sawa had called the other teacher back already while Yagami was doing this LUL
[1:49:53] <%silvery_cricket> How about the Chairman goes and checks on her
[1:49:56] <%silvery_cricket> and you can follow him
[1:49:57] <%baka_sugoi> Gotta save SAWA
[1:49:59] <%silvery_cricket> so he has deniability
[1:50:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Chairman sir, what if she came down with ligma!?

[2:41:50] <EmperorStarTurtle> Kaito was the real muscle. He is the true power of the Yagami Detective Agency.
[2:42:01] <%greasypete00> yagami now has a kdr of at least 3-0

[2:42:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Banging music
[2:42:20] <%Mattais88> Reason Yagami isn't in Judgement 3 is because he's serving time for throwing 3 people off a roof
[2:42:28] <+the22cstomp> there was not a cutscene they are completely dead
[2:42:32] <EmperorStarTurtle> It might as well be called the Kaito Detective Agency just to save time.

[2:45:30] <%VeryBestPlot> speeeen to win
[2:45:32] <+the22cstomp> i was trying to figure out why kuwana's va sounded so familiar, it's sho minazuki
[2:45:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Second time so far I think
[2:45:33] <%Dakuu75> what is this guy, Seymour? He just keeps coming back.
[2:45:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kicjlk it even harder
[2:45:41] <+twohitgood> akutsu has goro daimon's fighting stance.
[2:45:41] <EmperorStarTurtle> I hope Yagami gets a 1 vs 100 send off in this game.
[2:45:42] <%kewlmyc> He's not even important considering he doesn't get a cool cutscene intro to his boss fights.
[2:45:43] <%Dabrikishaw> Yakuza rules state you're supposed to stay unconscious until the next chapter
[2:45:43] <Jnkolm> the fastest asset reuse
[2:45:47] <@Ranryu692> did he just headbutt his own dude?
[2:45:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I mean, points for the never say die attitude, but these guys really need to learn
[2:45:50] <+Ardailec> Nice to see some invested tiger stance play. Most people seem to stick to snake
[2:45:51] <%tank7013> If I saw that shit and was still standing I would just walk the fuck away

[2:51:44] <Jnkolm> feenNotes
[2:51:49] <$OfficerMods> this guy is really good at his intimidation option select
[2:51:50] <%tank7013> Yea because he would have just let you stab him if you hadn't punched him
[2:51:52] <Ner234> To be fair that's his dick. ANYONE would move
[2:51:57] <%Dabrikishaw> Soma is established hard
[2:51:58] <BreakerDS> Yagami doesn't have ORB DEFENSE
[2:52:02] <HeroToxiko> LUL you are supposed to start with the other limbs, not immediate brain injury
[2:52:09] <+vaderxyz1970> This dude tortures puppies for fun

[2:52:34] <%megadblitz> but can he do sick kung fuuu
[2:52:39] <%tigerfang86> he's a brain villain who has A REALLY tough muscle villain
[2:52:40] <DianaTheAscian> until he actually has to fight you
[2:52:42] <%MonsterEnvy> He's outride said to be the actual boss
[2:52:48] <Treasure_Vault> He's like those romulans that time.
[2:52:50] <DianaTheAscian> then hes a huge joke
[2:52:53] <AstrodropGaming> What if Soma can do both though?!
[2:52:54] <%MelBrooksKA> He truly is the reality king
[2:52:58] <%Dabrikishaw> Soma is ESTABLISHED HARD
[2:52:58] <+HuoShengdi> they probably need sawa alive for some reason or she'd already be dead
[2:53:19] <Jnkolm> He's the smart one but since it's an RGG game he's also going to be the even Strongerer one
[2:53:20] <Blank9> and smart in non-booksmarts even
[2:53:24] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Hannibal is evergreen for a reason

[2:54:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Soma is super perceptive.

[2:55:26] <$OfficerMods> if he doens't magically teleport behind him
[2:55:28] <@Ranryu692> Kaito's "Akutsu needs his ass beat" sense was tingling
[2:55:28] <%DashXero> He doesn't look very fearful.
[2:55:32] <%Mattais88> Break the chair and kick thier asses for the fifth time
[2:55:37] <+HuoShengdi> he was an interrogator for the yakuza
[2:55:41] <%Dakuu75> why does this big goober hate Yagami so much?
[2:55:41] <%MonsterEnvy> @ElSuperNova Former Yakuza, now the founder and leader of the RK crime group.

[2:57:08] <shieldecho> Well. This escalated quickly.
[2:57:09] <zerointelligence000> so I guess that's your weapon for your next boss fight?
[2:57:09] <%sandrews> If you fuck up his face this bad he can be in the sequel
[2:57:11] <%Mattais88> Its not moving!
[2:57:11] <%razielhex> ARE YOU TAKIN' NOTES ON A GODDAMNED CONSPIRACY!?
[2:57:13] <ElSuperNova> CHAINSAW MAN HIMSELF

[2:57:20] <%MonsterEnvy> The other guys seem nervous about this.
[2:57:25] <slyb0nes> what while your goons are holding him
[2:57:25] <%Piemono> Uh You don't wanna be the guys holding him up
[2:57:27] <+Delenay> not while ppl are holding him
[2:57:30] <olaksi> sir this is fucked up
[2:57:35] <CrypticMochi> I mean chainsaws are terrible at cutting non-tree stuff, so he might die from pain first
[2:57:39] <+superchronicc> fuck this guy in particular

[2:57:52] <DianaTheAscian> Coward making the goons do it
[2:57:53] <zerointelligence000> "sir I just wanted money"
[2:57:54] <jifbua> chainsaws suck at cutting flesh and even more at cutting cloth it will jam before any serious dmg is done
[2:58:02] <+FanServ> i mean cartels and african gangs do some pretty terrible shit

[3:14:24] <%livlinn> oof
[3:14:28] <Jnkolm> Mafuyu is the only love interest allowed to live
[3:14:28] <slyb0nes> bro
[3:14:30] <@Ranryu692> yeah we do, the narrator just told us
[3:14:32] <+Delenay> even tho he had the stabby thing
[3:14:35] <%solracc25> What are we fighting for?
[3:14:35] <EmperorStarTurtle> They did not say
[3:14:38] <thomas7404> oof
[3:14:39] <+superchronicc> are we in Ijincho?
[3:14:42] <%KineticZen> LULW
[3:14:44] <%castlerock42> Statistically speaking, at least someone killed her.
[3:14:46] <%grimr2004> I mean there is a knife mark where he was holding the knife pat
[3:14:56] <olaksi> no narrator can't lie that's illega√∂
[3:14:56] <+fetrigon> pat you're wrong. accept it.
[3:14:57] <HeroToxiko> didn't he show her on the phone being knife threatened by his guy?
[3:15:00] <+fetrigon> PunOko
[3:15:01] <%Treuan> Yagami you're kind of covered in blood
[3:15:02] <%colezone_> Woah Man a narrator would never lie!
[3:15:03] <SirDogBear> the narrator was the mastermind behind everything PogChamp
[3:15:04] <%greasypete00> he sounds very not upset
[3:15:05] <slyb0nes> the icepick to the neck kinda narrows it down
[3:15:06] <%BlackStarAura> TOUCH EVERYTHING
[3:15:13] <%grimr2004> Seee
[3:15:14] <DianaTheAscian> DON'T TOUCH THE BODY
[3:15:14] <+toastybites> "don't touch anything" *touches the corpse*
[3:15:17] <%MelBrooksKA> Stop touching the body Kaito!
[3:15:21] <%sandrews> You think someone would just do that? Lie when narrating?
[3:15:22] <Treasure_Vault> It's nice to just call the cops in this kind of game
[3:15:26] <+Kyma1020> He said she's sleeping
[3:15:27] <%bigboyeggo> wait
[3:15:28] <+fetrigon> @olaksi exactly but he's not hearing it.
[3:15:29] <%bigboyeggo> where's her kid
[3:15:31] <huskarl_zap> Hopefully ichibong doesn't plead guilty for this one too
[3:15:31] <$OfficerMods> pat has a point this is an rggs game there's a real possiblity that some mystery spook came in and killed her to make sure the CIA can create a theme park

[3:16:18] <%MugenSandan> We gotta find out who murdered this woman Pat *Pat cleans stinky sausage dog*
[3:16:18] <%TheGreatSkenardo> She might have been a secret Korean
[3:16:19] <+vaderxyz1970> So your homeroom teacher was murdered BUT were going to NATIONALS!!!!!!!!
[3:16:20] <+Catpurnicus> either that or she's not actually  dead
[3:16:21] <@Ranryu692> Kaito almost stepped on some bloody footprints

[3:16:49] <%Jhylla81> First thing? wipe all your prints
[3:16:58] <zerointelligence000> I bet Kuwanano is secretly korean and wants revenge
[3:16:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> @herotoxiko i like how you're using fighting game terms for a murder LUL
[3:16:59] <%Dakuu75> if they were there when the cops arrived, they'd all be found guilty for this, right?
[3:16:59] <%Dabrikishaw> The juxtaposition of ALL THIS with he school clubs has never been stranger.
[3:16:59] <DianaTheAscian> oof
[3:17:00] <%MelBrooksKA> Kitataka sounds like an even faker name
[3:17:09] <%Mr_Pylon> ice pick is a classic after all
[3:17:11] <olaksi> cops only arrive at times that make the a problem in these games
[3:17:11] <%kewlmyc> Who's the first?
[3:17:13] <%Breaknoon> kill with an ice knife, boom. Murder weapon melts.
[3:17:14] <%Maids4lyfe> wat
[3:17:15] <EmperorStarTurtle> Icepick is good murder tool
[3:17:16] <%Maids4lyfe> *wait
[3:17:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's effective I guess
[3:17:19] <%sandrews> think they got an ice pick club you can join?
[3:17:19] <%castlerock42> It's a solid weapon.
[3:17:20] <%Jhylla81> She is actually really into knitting and extremely clumsy
[3:17:20] <@ssjklyco> They know how to pick them
[3:17:22] <%solracc25> *looks like it
[3:17:22] <%Maids4lyfe> school teacher was murdered?
[3:17:23] <+fetrigon> I hope that's a quick death
[3:17:34] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt "Its ICED to meet ya"
[3:17:39] <+PrincessLuna85> @ssjklyco i guess this will be a cold case
[3:17:45] <+Greywyn00> severing the spinal cord is usually pretty quick
[3:17:49] <DianaTheAscian> just a random Jar
[3:17:49] <%Dakuu75> @rosemon5001 boooooo
[3:17:50] <%BlackStarAura> That‚Äôs a spine wound, so it should‚Äôve been instant
[3:17:50] <brachydios777> icepicks are dangerous
[3:17:52] <EmperorStarTurtle> It is effective, Hideable.
[3:17:54] <%tank7013> Kinda looked like they were signposting one in the cutscene but guess not
[3:17:55] <HeroToxiko> @OneThousandTomatoes i don't think she'll be waking up from this one tho

[3:19:26] <%BlackStarAura> Lick the screen
[3:19:26] <ExpressNode> So did they call the cops or did someone else?
[3:19:32] <+Jelmauz> emoneyPain
[3:19:32] <%Jhylla81> Clearly the killer is a iphone fan and she had an android
[3:19:37] <%sandrews> this is one of the most accurate apartment's I've ever seen
[3:19:38] <ohno778> PRESS L2 TO THONK
[3:19:42] <TheQuadrupleS> Did they explain how they found Yagami??
[3:19:45] <%Garthunox> bookshelf beside her body
[3:19:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a good thing the attackers shoes were covered in brown paint
[3:19:48] <@Ranryu692> there are way too many footstep noises
[3:19:48] <T_Sasquatch> Yagami commits crimes constantly
[3:19:48] <DianaTheAscian> The foot prints?
[3:19:52] <%grimr2004> the sounds he makes are so missleading man
[3:19:54] <%Jhylla81> Raid her fridge
[3:19:56] <%greasypete00> ceiling maybe
[3:20:01] <%DashXero> @TheQuadrupleS Kinda.
[3:20:01] <Madinki> Know these games Sawa is probably still alive and this her twin or lookalike or some shit.

[3:20:50] <%athuramn> sad LUL
[3:20:54] <T_Sasquatch> Examine feet Kappa
[3:21:06] <+toastybites> tears = sad instead of fear for her life okay
[3:21:08] <%Jhylla81> I would love to see the 3rd person perspective of Yagami just circling around and randomly looking at stuff
[3:21:11] <TheQuadrupleS> @DashXero how? I must've missed it
[3:21:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> its a bit weird that it looks like an exit wound
[3:21:20] <Treasure_Vault> Blood under the stuff
[3:21:23] <@Ranryu692> she left you a clue with her arterial spray!
[3:21:27] <zerointelligence000> who's the next classmate
[3:21:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> like would it splatter out like that?
[3:21:30] <+Delenay> seriously. thats how we find the year book. her blood pointed them in the right direction

[3:21:57] <Madinki> @Jhylla81 (Examines Sawa's ice pick wound) "Suspicious...."
[3:21:58] <Psyramics> just write his name on the wall with her own spray
[3:22:00] <@Ranryu692> I was joking I didn't think they would say it
[3:22:01] <@ssjklyco> Its not the dumbest theory in a japanese murder mystery game
[3:22:02] <Ner234> Pat no D:
[3:22:04] <Psyramics> draw his face
[3:22:05] <TheVoltStrike> remember guys if you're dying, spray your blood towards where the culprit is running
[3:22:09] <%DashXero> @TheQuadrupleS Someone tried calling Yagami, and when he couldn't answer, tipped off his pals who used cameras around the city to find him.

[3:25:12] <T_Sasquatch> I don't get how she warned Kaito
[3:25:13] <+SilverDevilfish> unlike the Yakuza
[3:25:13] <ohno778> if you plan on murdering somebody and get away with it maybe make sure your shoes are clean
[3:25:15] <+fetrigon> @toastybites meh, alright.
[3:25:17] <HeroToxiko> @brunoberserk have you heard the new andrew wk track, it's sick.
[3:25:19] <Jnkolm> Maybe Sawa isn't dead and that was Mirror Face
[3:25:38] <TheQuadrupleS> Couldn't Yagami give em a description
[3:25:44] <TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[3:25:45] <%castlerock42> This cop is a weird combination of helpful and unhelpful.
[3:25:53] <+Chronobot> Mirror face clan
[3:25:54] <+bugz_munny> fucking who
[3:25:57] <slyb0nes> "Well, you're covered in blood and were found in the room of a murder victim, but you can go home I guess"
[3:25:57] <+Catpurnicus> man mirror face is getting a group rate in this game
[3:26:00] <zerointelligence000> I legit want mirror face to be a party member in yakuza
[3:26:01] <%baka_sugoi> he's too underground for this shit
[3:26:01] <@Ranryu692> is Mirror Face just Chameleon?
[3:26:02] <%MelBrooksKA> You know the most probable killer, god you're useless
[3:26:03] <%MugenSandan> maybe Mirror Face IS dead and Sawa is the new Mirror Face!
[3:26:05] <BisoromiBear> Shin Mirror Face
[3:26:05] <huskarl_zap> Face off is now forever in play
[3:26:05] <%Dabrikishaw> Mirror Face kinda ruins plots like these yeah
[3:26:06] <brunoberserk> mirror face is just decoy octopus ?
[3:26:09] <T_Sasquatch> @castlerock42 so like a cop?
[3:26:11] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't think Mirrior Face can fake a dead body
[3:26:16] <time2getsweaty> is there like a sound filter on the stream or something?
[3:26:26] <ElSuperNova> THE TOP HUH
[3:26:27] <HeroToxiko> @brunoberserk he would just lie about the blood so they won't bother
[3:26:27] <%castlerock42> @T_Sasquatch You know, you got me, there.
[3:26:28] <EmperorStarTurtle> ...
[3:26:36] <%TheAdMerlin> I hope Mirror Face comes back
[3:26:37] <ohno778> hmmmm....
[3:26:40] <+xerotwo> CORRUPT BS
[3:26:44] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:26:45] <Jnkolm> The ending of this game is that Mirror Face has been Yagami the whole time
[3:26:52] <+toastybites> @MonsterEnvy change the face of the dead body
[3:27:00] <SaltyAzteca> Sounds more like a pride thing
[3:27:06] <%MugenSandan> I hope we get Like A Mirror Face
[3:27:14] <@Ranryu692> now it's time to prove that the groping victim was in on it, I guess
[3:27:17] <%MonsterEnvy> @MonsterEnvy Which would be found out on any investigation.
[3:27:20] <olaksi> there's only video evidence the guy committed murder, our hands are tied

[3:27:40] <HeroToxiko> @Jnkolm he was the coolest guy
[3:27:43] <%tank7013> Go back to your weird coke zero smash pit Sakurai
[3:27:44] <%castlerock42> What kills me about Mirror Face is that he can even change his body type super fast.
[3:27:45] <%moonmintparadise> Im gonna get so fucking good at virtua fighter now
[3:27:46] <$OfficerMods> hey isn't cool that the murder took place in the room you fought mirror face?
[3:27:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Alright team, we're gonna use this pain to go straight to the top!

[3:28:18] <slyb0nes> why do they do assembly like I did in elementary school
[3:28:23] <olaksi> big it can't be helped energy
[3:28:24] <%tank7013> Please think about the school's reputation
[3:28:24] <+Chronobot> Dont snitch, that is all
[3:28:25] <%InternetShis> They'll kidnap a rando and beat your ass extrajudiciously to get a false confession out of you
[3:28:26] <%kewlmyc> Prayer means fuck all of their dead
[3:28:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why would you NOT  want them to talk to em?

[3:28:35] <%MashinChaserR> what a bint
[3:28:36] <%Alazull> Worse than the principal from P5?
[3:28:37] <%livlinn> wow this principal is pretty honest for a Japanese school psaElmo
[3:28:38] <+toastybites> @cobalt_phoenix_ its your right
[3:28:42] <Treasure_Vault> No one know what happened, so uhhh maybe that's fine? - That guy
[3:28:50] <%W1nterTitan> Why not send them home for the day?!
[3:28:52] <%Movemeister> Thoughts and prayers
[3:29:00] <ExpressNode> @alazull That's exactly what I was thinking
[3:29:03] <Madinki> It's what she would want
[3:29:06] <%TheGreatSkenardo> two in the thoughts, one in the prayers
[3:29:08] <%baka_sugoi> it was you
[3:29:09] <slyb0nes> not really
[3:29:10] <%kewlmyc> No, you kinda did
[3:29:11] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man school fucking sucks
[3:29:18] <%InternetShis> Ehhhh
[3:29:19] <%DashXero> She would have been dead even if Yagami weren't involved.
[3:29:21] <%Dabrikishaw> Kobyakawa was worse because he was a member of the conspiracy, but he at least had the decency to go to the cops.
[3:29:22] <@Ranryu692> if that lady had given you her address, Sawa would still be alive
[3:29:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ no like don't talk to em if you don't wanna for sure, but i read that as do NOT talk to em please, did i misunderstand?
[3:29:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> idk she probably wouldn't be doing so hot if you weren't there either
[3:29:26] <ExpressNode> Zanbeef
[3:29:28] <%baka_sugoi> only avery little bit
[3:29:28] <EmperorStarTurtle> You could save the PR until AFTER mourning.
[3:29:29] <slyb0nes> she woulda been dead anyway? The gang was already there
[3:29:30] <+Catpurnicus> yagami should say "its what she would want" before every scene now
[3:29:31] <EmperorStarTurtle> Jesus
[3:29:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> i mean to be fair she wasnt willing to talk about the stuff she clearly knew about
[3:29:33] <Zombrocom> Eh, they woulda gone for her anyway
[3:29:35] <DianaTheAscian> she would have been killed if your weren't there at all tbh
[3:29:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> partially her fault too
[3:29:38] <ohno778> i can
[3:29:38] <Madinki> @JustAnotherTrapArtist Glad I graduated before Covid hit
[3:29:39] <Treasure_Vault> I can't believe you murdered her in your fugue state
[3:29:46] <+Chronobot> tbf, we did go race mopeds
[3:29:54] <ElSuperNova> NO
[3:29:55] <%TheGreatSkenardo> that's a plant for sure
[3:29:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> Beat her up!
[3:30:00] <DianaTheAscian> no

[3:30:08] <Teras_ode> Is this Haru's voice?
[3:30:08] <%faintsmile> it was worth it

[3:30:14] <+FanServ> pat you have to live your own life and death race with a moped sometimes, no matter who it kills
[3:30:15] <Treasure_Vault> I can't believe there was a secret intruder in the room during the video
[3:30:16] <+Mrbaconator> her death is worth the sick mopeds
[3:30:17] <%InternetShis> 100%
[3:30:18] <SaltyAzteca> Dude, its REALLY tricked out though ngl
[3:30:18] <DusK_The_Stray> Sick tricks were more important
[3:30:20] <slyb0nes> what's the life of a school teacher compared to being a ROAD WARRIOR
[3:30:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nah
[3:30:22] <Madinki> WORTH IT.
[3:30:22] <%castlerock42> She would definitely still be alive, but who the fuck cares.
[3:30:23] <AstrodropGaming> maybe
[3:30:23] <%Dwarfinaflask> wheels before feels
[3:30:25] <DianaTheAscian> It was worth it

[3:33:56] <@Ranryu692> we used to buy instant ramen from a truck that had a big kettle
[3:33:59] <%ThomasOfTroy> I used to sprinkle the seasoning on the block and eat the block raw, that shit was rad
[3:34:01] <%Dakuu75> it's like a big cracker
[3:34:04] <+JustToWatch> ramen is raw though, the noodles have been fried
[3:34:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> says you as you chew dry pasta

[3:34:19] <%chiazam> god

[3:34:22] <%livlinn> some instant ramen is good like that
[3:34:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> my school had a microwave but it had a spring loaded timer and a bell

[3:35:08] <%Garthunox> Pat you should really keep playing it on stream, didnt it take you two years to beat the last one?
[3:35:09] <%Jhylla81> NO
[3:35:09] <Zombrocom> I can't sadly
[3:35:09] <%Alazull> That's a really hot bad take
[3:35:09] <%Mr_Pylon> It's the lesser of two evils
[3:35:10] <%barrakuta371> uhhhh
[3:35:10] <+Mrbaconator> NO IT DOESN'T

[3:35:11] <T_Sasquatch> I stick by that
[3:35:11] <BisoromiBear> same level
[3:35:11] <%greasypete00> why not just do neither
[3:35:11] <%Dopamien> it actually does DansGame
[3:35:12] <Jmann1892> It Does
[3:35:13] <DianaTheAscian> No it doesn't
[3:35:13] <%kewlmyc> Both are weird as fuck
[3:35:14] <+Mrbaconator> YOU'RE INSANE
[3:35:14] <%monsieurfantastic> yes
[3:35:15] <+bugz_munny> BOTH ARE WRONG
[3:35:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> I have ate dry pasta, but i will never drink mustard
[3:35:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> at least mustard has flavor
[3:35:20] <%Movemeister> Tbh
[3:35:20] <Zebroneath> so the boiled water is your saliva?
[3:35:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> it doesn't make more sense but I'll tolerate the mustard because it doesn't make the bad mouth sounds
[3:35:22] <%notsoy> absolutely not - do you know what nurungji is, right?
[3:35:23] <%cade_calrayn> It's better than Paige eating the sticks of the lollipops
[3:35:24] <%Axellogic> I have a PC
[3:35:24] <%Garthunox> RIGHT INTO THE MIC!
[3:35:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Both of them are freaks
[3:35:26] <OldManDeckardCain> what if you are pc?
[3:35:27] <CatRidder> is just like eating sugar
[3:35:28] <%tank7013> you might as well be eating thin plastic
[3:35:28] <KohryuZX> YOU'RE INSANE
[3:35:28] <DianaTheAscian> It did?
[3:35:29] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL

[3:35:30] <EmperorStarTurtle> no
[3:35:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> BUT I WANT 60 FPS!?
[3:35:33] <%whoppernugget> Oh that is wrong
[3:35:33] <+fetrigon> wait you can eat dry pasta?
[3:35:35] <+Tonku_the_Red> Eating dry pasta is weird and probably not good for you. . .
[3:35:36] <%Profmcstevie> Chat wtf just raw consuming condiments is fucking weird
[3:35:37] <%Jhylla81> Dry pasta is still food. Mustard is a condiment. It is not proper food
[3:35:46] <+toastybites> you can hardly digest uncooked pasta
[3:35:50] <DianaTheAscian> @barrakuta371 its super not on PC
[3:35:57] <@ssjklyco> Meat mup, meat me up inside, can't meat up
[3:35:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> drinking mustard is eating mustard in large quantities, a condiment. but dry pasta is like small bits of food
[3:36:01] <%Breaknoon> get ya that table spoon of mayo mane
[3:36:04] <olaksi> pat what the hell
[3:36:04] <+toastybites> @fetrigon if you want to fuck up your digestion

[3:36:50] <%barrakuta371> @dianatheascian well I guess I'll watch another playthrough, or maybe buy a PS5, whenever that's possible
[3:36:52] <olaksi> how is that different from dry pasta
[3:36:53] <+Arek_1> LUL
[3:36:56] <+xerotwo> Well you can make pancakes with flour and water, right?
[3:37:00] <+toastybites> i think you can actually die from eating raw flour
[3:37:05] <%baka_sugoi> BOAT
[3:37:10] <Madinki> Just make a fuck tone of bread
[3:37:16] <Watoo22> @toastybites correct
[3:37:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @xerotwo that's a tortilla
