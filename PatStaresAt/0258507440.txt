[0:44:34] <+redstonej> MORE BANG BANG
[0:44:35] <+mcjimbo12> @crimsonharvest It's literally Gul'dan's idle stance LUL
[0:44:39] <deviljhojho94> he has horrid stats
[0:44:41] <hippofant> If you have a gun in one hand, and a melee weapon in the other, does that mean you swap between the two for ranged/melee? Or are you "Dual-wielding" in melee?
[0:44:52] <+ABadIdea> oh shit, did Pat make Vaxildan? yandHappy
[0:44:57] <asurite_warrior> never got the huge dislike of aloth but i had him in my party a long time so i guess i just enjoyed his shy nerd attitude
[0:45:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Are there Bards in this game?
[0:45:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Can you respec attributes?
[0:45:11] <elementofloyalty> Mave?
[0:45:13] <+mcjimbo12> @asurite_warrior because he fucking lied to you super hard for the whole first game, i liked him up until then
[0:45:13] <deviljhojho94> there are chanters
[0:45:21] <Seraphile> I love aloth cause hes a shitty elf stereotype and fun to bully
[0:45:24] <+dawsfloss> tamriel
[0:45:25] <InsomniacPersona> Cuz at sea
[0:45:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie Sort of, they're called Chanters. They sing songs that summon, buff, or debuff.
[0:45:27] <Cleverspambot> its so you can build them in whatever direction you want, attributes are pretty minor
[0:45:30] <elementofloyalty> They wanted to go to Whore Island
[0:45:32] <deviljhojho94> aloth is for bullying ye
[0:45:32] <StubYourToe> man, this is convoluted
[0:45:32] <%ziriken> being at sea lowers morale over time
[0:45:33] <gluemanofficial> You lost morale because you used shitty food and shitty drink
[0:45:34] <KTDelgado> i onder if paligina is gonna get a multiclass or just stay paladin
[0:45:36] <%commanderclaw> git gud
[0:45:38] <Kenori> Wow, they're making Liam O'Brien strong
[0:45:46] <Kenori> I wonder if Vax is Paladin/Rogue
[0:45:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie That's Bardy enough for me
[0:45:47] <+mcjimbo12> @KTDelgado you get two choice, or the multiclass of the both
[0:45:49] <%Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Is this game on the Switch yet
[0:45:51] <Kenori> He has to be right?
[0:45:51] <Seraphile> looks like if you rolled for stats in D&D
[0:45:55] <elementofloyalty> HER?
[0:45:58] <ragasquid> worf
[0:46:00] <InsomniacPersona> morale just goes down longer in the sea you are
[0:46:01] <%Gogogolem> You cook is commander Worf!
[0:46:02] <Psych_man13_13> NO HONOR
[0:46:03] <+TonberryCrunch> He lied super hard then turns heel at his boss + Iselmyr rules
[0:46:03] <Cleverspambot> palegina can duel chanter which seems rad
[0:46:04] <%GummiBunnies> THAT'S WHY YOUR FOOD IS BAD LMAO
[0:46:04] <leinadtonu> GOT WORFED
[0:46:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie You could multiclass rogue/chanter, focus on buffs and debuffs from the chanter tree. Basically a bard.
[0:46:06] <TheAimless> Worf is your cook?
[0:46:10] <%Slaardacity> Like worf?
[0:46:10] <%Gogogolem> The barrel Has no HONOR!
[0:46:13] <%WorldSoup5> ! MORALE AT RISK !
[0:46:15] <+griffball13> and a drunkard
[0:46:17] <Bouldus> its woolie
[0:46:17] <elementofloyalty> Jordie should be the cook
[0:46:19] <$LocDogX86X> your crew got the scurvy
[0:46:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Thanks for the tip.

[0:50:50] <Iam_Dead> So the small gremlin looks like a shrunk down version of the live action grinch @AngriestPat

[0:51:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Carnage only worked with melee in 1, I don't know about 2.
[0:51:12] <prime_name> Is Paladin/Barbarian multiclass any good?
[0:51:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Read Carnage's description.
[0:51:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> @prime_name Game is early access, how the fuck would anybody know?
[0:51:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's your first passive ability

[0:52:09] <PsychedelicSnake> !BLIND!
[0:52:11] <elementofloyalty> PEACH Lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the body’s organs. In severe cases, organs damage and failure can occur. Over 90 percent of people with lupus are women between the ages of 15 and 45.
[0:52:18] <InsomniacPersona> Weapons only
[0:52:33] <+mcjimbo12> @elementofloyalty hey buddy i think she probably knows what it is LUL
[0:52:38] <%jiin6> only Guns
[0:52:42] <elementofloyalty> 80 to 90 percent of people with lupus can expect to live a normal lifespan.
[0:52:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Paladin/Barbarian sounds like a bad mix tbh. Barbs get bonus damage based on having less than half health while paladins are always blocking.
[0:52:43] <Kenori> Wait does that mean that once Peach reaches 46 she wont have it anymore?
[0:52:45] <KTDelgado> thats not very gungang of you pat
[0:52:46] <Kenori> Only 2 more years to go
[0:52:48] <Deadishimura> I just got a dog twitch ad. How dare you as a cat owner allow that?
[0:52:59] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> AHAHAHA playing Dragons Dogma and just found a Pawn running around and saw that he's actually a short guy named ANGRY PAT @AngriestPat
[0:53:03] <Iam_Dead> She'll absorb the lupus to become even stronger.
[0:53:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Plus paladins' self-heal abilities would be irrelevant with Barbs' self-heals.

[1:27:22] <%TheGreatBamBe> So you're saying I can waifu the death goddess? I might just have to finish the first one
[1:27:22] <captainthunderwolf> @AbnormalVoid Eothas is definitively a crazed god who is eating people's souls, and he's the most relatable and approachable of the gods.
[1:27:26] <xiccy> Why do you people insist on pissing of the incredibly powerful gods?
[1:27:27] <%ECRead> Do not trust gods GOWKratos

[1:29:25] <TheImmortal70> Good on him
[1:29:28] <elementofloyalty> Taco Tuesday
[1:29:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's great.
[1:29:29] <MarylandJutsu> Right, Right the Release Date and such
[1:29:33] <crimsonharvest> oh how sweet but FUCK THESE BABY SOULS
[1:29:46] <elementofloyalty> Was?
[1:29:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @crimsonharvest Those babies were evil!
[1:29:56] <Cleverspambot> picking the wael option requires being super petty, almost every other option is better for the dyrwood, the wael option is just saying "fuck you gods" because a god told you to
[1:29:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> The keep is gone.
[1:29:59] <xiccy> @captainthunderwolf They could literally force everyone to forget you, including themselves.
[1:30:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Eothas fucked up the keep.
[1:30:06] <%jiin6> we bought HER along
[1:30:08] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat whats the god you like other than wael
[1:30:11] <deviljhojho94> the gods of POE are not that strong
[1:30:12] <deviljhojho94> really
[1:30:16] <MonsieurHedge> DICK THE STATUE DOWN
[1:30:25] <deviljhojho94> they are more like super strong AI instead of true divinity
[1:30:27] <elementofloyalty> FIRE
[1:30:27] <%jiin6> so you didn't kill that dragon?
[1:30:28] <asurite_warrior> i chose the empower option because i felt like i should try to repair the damage to the deerwood
[1:30:30] <captainthunderwolf> @xiccy THEN I FORCED THEIR HANDS TO THE LEVEL OF A B S O L U T I O N, MEANING I WIN.
[1:30:33] <$spacehouse> ABYDON
[1:30:34] <antthefool> Oh man I’m happy the chair is alive
[1:30:45] <%commanderclaw> Hylea is second best, Abydon is third
[1:30:49] <+HeyBoston> super strong AI that move your soul through eternity on a whim
[1:30:51] <Dellago> Gods in Poe cant do much to the real world without people to act through. Like how Eothas possessed the farmer
[1:30:53] <Ser_Randal> Ahem the god of preservation
[1:30:57] <deviljhojho94> Still AI
[1:30:59] <deviljhojho94> Not true gods
[1:30:59] <elementofloyalty> *So much Honey on the counter top
[1:31:02] <%jiin6> ALL OF THAT MONEY LADY
[1:31:04] <captainthunderwolf> Wael, Hylea, Abydon, Eothas. These are the only good gods.
[1:31:07] <Lee_The_Limey> YOU SPENT MY MONEY?!
[1:31:14] <+TheHypestCripple> I dunno, Rymrgand was pretty...chill
[1:31:15] <Terran_Gell> The Defiant is a tough little ship.
[1:31:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Eothas is not a good god.
[1:31:24] <+MrRabbles> the only good god is a dead god GOWKratos
[1:31:24] <elementofloyalty> XOTI is from Texas?
[1:31:33] <Seraphile> abydon is a bro
[1:31:33] <ArcticAsylum> XOTI Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:31:34] <%commanderclaw> UNF, DAT VOICE
[1:31:37] <%Mistheart101> The dahkness
[1:31:41] <graffitisamurai> Fantasy Texas <3
[1:31:42] <asurite_warrior> i likevthe gods that stick to what they say their aspects are so wale abydon maybe eothas and i guess skaen
[1:31:44] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie The whole point of Pillars 1 was the revelation that he's a good dude, my man.
[1:31:46] <+griffball13> Eder is pleased WITH THAT ASS
[1:31:46] <%Slaardacity> This is like when Roll sold Megamans videogames and weapons for ship parts
[1:31:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Xoti is Laura Bailey.
[1:31:49] <MonsieurHedge> she really is a qt, huh
[1:31:49] <elementofloyalty> Sexy texass
[1:31:50] <%Slaardacity> what a bitch
[1:31:52] <+KennyK> Is Fantasy Texas in Fantasy America?
[1:31:53] <+timblenaut> just pronounce her name "shawty"
[1:31:58] <ArcticAsylum> I'm from the South so Xoti ia basically my wife....or cousin
[1:31:59] <Scumsave> they basically ripped off Ancient Aliens
[1:32:01] <StubYourToe> fantasy italian texan
[1:32:03] <xiccy> @captainthunderwolf Fuck all that. I enjoy life way too much. Don't matter that they are fake gods, as long as they don't actively fuck my life up who cares.
[1:32:04] <+KennyK> Or is Fantasy Texas its own Country?
[1:32:07] <deviljhojho94> Fantasy mexican with a texan accents
[1:32:08] <Lee_The_Limey> I watched the Lion King to learn that Kappa
[1:32:08] <captainthunderwolf> And Wael just doesn't care and that's the best.
[1:32:14] <Thalchampz> rebahth?
[1:32:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf But the whole point of this game is that you can't be reborn the same. Eothas isn't the same as he was.
[1:32:22] <elementofloyalty> Pissles?
[1:32:23] <deviljhojho94> Xoti is a southern native mexican name, but her accent is southern USA state
[1:32:25] <deviljhojho94> interesting
[1:32:30] <wsintai> Oh god she reads Jesus Fanfic
[1:32:43] <deviljhojho94> Well, Xoti is not literrally a native name, but you get the idea
[1:32:45] <Lee_The_Limey> It would be the youngest Kappa
[1:32:49] <+KennyK> Its not fanfic if you are Fantasy Catholic
[1:32:50] <Bailey__gaming> apissles?
[1:32:55] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie You're referring to this game that you and everyone else knows ~15% of the plot of, using it as a reference in an incomplete state with no definitive conclusion?
[1:32:56] <elementofloyalty> GGrubby?
[1:32:58] <%titans_ace_jerid> So... who the fuck is Gaun?
[1:33:02] <Scumsave> shes a slutty priestess
[1:33:07] <ArcticAsylum> YOU CAN GET YOUR GRUBBY HANDS ON ME GURL
[1:33:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Eothas has literally been stealing souls, from living people.
[1:33:14] <Scumsave> imagine durance still being in game and meeting her
[1:33:14] <deviljhojho94> Gaun is the lantern guy that is eothas' buttbuddy
[1:33:15] <Reanimator83> Show me on this doll where they were touched
[1:33:22] <elementofloyalty> FIDDLE FOOT?
[1:33:24] <Darren716> Know what else is natural? Aids
[1:33:27] <deviljhojho94> Durance would eat this gal alive
[1:33:33] <Lee_The_Limey> Shed those clothes gurl Kappa
[1:33:34] <elementofloyalty> HARDCORE
[1:33:35] <ArcticAsylum> LUL

[1:33:48] <%badmr7> I lover her drawl
[1:33:51] <%SomeSortOfMagic> Yes you can
[1:33:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Even if there's some justification for it, he doesn't qualify as a good god at this point.
[1:34:06] <elementofloyalty> SHE
[1:34:09] <%SomeSortOfMagic> you can certianly telly ou god to go jump offa brgidge
[1:34:09] <deviljhojho94> HAS
[1:34:13] <KTDelgado> SHE LOVES THAT SICKLE
[1:34:15] <captainthunderwolf> @xiccy And as a mortal, my inability to survive forever means that FUCK 'EM is an adequate way to pass
[1:34:25] <ArcticAsylum> A
[1:34:31] <elementofloyalty> PEACH GET OUT HERE
[1:34:48] <Lee_The_Limey> Fuck you Aloth
[1:34:57] <KTDelgado> FUCK
[1:35:00] <Bailey__gaming> @badmr7 irk I keep expecting her to yell at Gambit for being a perv!
[1:35:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Aloth's new portrait makes him look like a fuck.
[1:35:04] <%commanderclaw> Tell us what you're doing you shady fuck
[1:35:09] <Psych_man13_13> Seriously, all i can think of when i see the ships name is Deep Space 9
[1:35:11] <KTDelgado> I LIKE SHAWTY EVEN MORE NO
[1:35:12] <elementofloyalty> Hey Aloth,hows that gapping wound?
[1:35:16] <+redstonej> is she supposed to be like a preachers daughter
[1:35:23] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie In a universe with an endless cycle of built-in reincarnation, coming from a god who genuinely believes he's going to fix the world, and WAS GOING TO in the last game before Durance's buddies killed him, Imma say we should withhold judgement for now.
[1:35:31] <deviljhojho94> yeah
[1:35:37] <xiccy> @captainthunderwolf But like Thaos, they could make you immortal, send you to that winter plane, and just forget about you.
[1:35:38] <%jiin6> EDAR LOVES IT
[1:35:38] <elementofloyalty> 5 5 5 5
[1:35:46] <+MrRabbles> why is the party in the background of every conversation giving you assists?
[1:35:51] <%commanderclaw> 55555
[1:35:52] <startadevy> get you
[1:36:06] <%jiin6> or the revenge
[1:36:08] <elementofloyalty> Paige,are you diddling yuorself in there?
[1:36:24] <+KennyK> is the elf Gay?
[1:36:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Fair enough. Working theory as of now, with that conversation with the gods that just happened, is that Eothas sired kids during his time as a mortal and that's how he plans to get his full self back.
[1:36:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Steal Aloth's kidney in his sleep
[1:36:35] <captainthunderwolf> @xiccy There are two kinds of people; those that spite gods, and bitches. Thaos was a bitch, and lest we forget that they iced that fucker.
[1:36:38] <%jiin6> Xoti loves the murder
[1:36:44] <deviljhojho94> all elves are gay, but some elves are gayer than others
[1:36:48] <Lee_The_Limey> Well Aloth , you need somebody to lead you because that's why you cant get shit done
[1:36:55] <RowenCleric> Pat defeated Thanos in the last game?
[1:37:02] <elementofloyalty> Is he Irish?
[1:37:07] <deviljhojho94> no, but he was
[1:37:14] <+timblenaut> better impersonation than pat for sure
[1:37:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> @elementofloyalty He has an Irish girl's soul inside him.
[1:37:24] <elementofloyalty> PEACH IS ALIVE
[1:37:25] <Dellago> He's two souls in one body, the other one is a Scottish woman he was in a past life
[1:37:26] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie That would be neat. "Demigods as a power play" is a pretty overused god trope, but I trust Pillar's writing staff to make it good.
[1:37:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> "My trump card was my semen!"
[1:37:46] <elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat check those hands for clean water
[1:37:54] <startadevy> ahhhhhhhhh

[1:41:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> GOOD. One less romantic rival
[1:41:09] <elementofloyalty> 3
[1:41:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder that last stream Pat pickpocketed Eder while giving him relationship advice.

[1:43:20] <Faultlined> Eder is the best bro
[1:43:21] <ArcticAsylum> like 8 hours
[1:43:23] <Lee_The_Limey> About 8 inches deep
[1:43:25] <%jiin6> Xoti seems the type to murder everyone while they sleep
[1:43:29] <$Chimeraelite> This is maybe 8 hours in
[1:43:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> If that big old Christ statue in South America started walking around and sucking up souls I'd probably feel a lot cooler about it.
[1:43:32] <elementofloyalty> Malicious?
[1:43:50] <Mr_LupLup> It would make me start worshipping him probably
[1:43:50] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Pat's like barely in, he's played of r8 hours but has only gotten like 6 hours worth in because of talking breaks
[1:44:05] <%jiin6> Pat's not Cruel
[1:44:12] <elementofloyalty> Pats a puss
[1:44:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Or Team Statue

[1:45:02] <$Chimeraelite> Looks damned good
[1:45:02] <%commanderclaw> Eventually, they'll start to have a breakthrough in their relationship
[1:45:13] <count_bob> THE QUEST FOR ELMO.
[1:45:15] <%Arxel1> Serafen was there pat :/
[1:45:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> And this game got delayed instead of rushed.
[1:45:23] <xiccy> Serafin's on the deck

[1:46:31] <investorscratchit> God damnit i got a notification that paige was streaming

[1:54:37] <Psych_man13_13> DELETE THE GAME
[1:54:40] <+KennyK> Traditionally, the people being boarded don't run directly into the fire of the pirates boarding them
[1:54:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's always a bigger ship.
[1:54:41] <lankaster88> Game over yeah!

[1:54:58] <wsintai> LUL
[1:54:59] <applesonthemoon> bigger boat = bigger crew, shooting at a ship approaching head on is a bad idea

[2:14:35] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Strange Journey too hard, P3-5 nice and easy for idiot brain
[2:14:40] <+TendrilsTwitch> persona is a real smt game, get over yourself
[2:14:42] <mr_slaide> P5 was great.
[2:14:50] <%jiin6> P5 was good, people don't like the animated series for some odd reason
[2:14:58] <Milo_san> DDS?
[2:15:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> The animated series is by A-1.
[2:15:06] <Kaurisen> Play a real SMT game, like The Ultimate Doom

[2:15:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> A-1 has low quality animations.
[2:15:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> @jiin6 I think it's cause you could just play the game instead
[2:15:17] <mr_slaide> Paige is always sick.
[2:15:18] <+0samura1> less pat more shapeshifter
[2:15:21] <+TDotGoat> sipsipHonk

[2:15:30] <WhiteRice92> Is Paige dying? Like always?
[2:15:32] <mr_slaide> No more cheese to eat, Pat?
[2:15:33] <StubYourToe> thats her default

[2:15:35] <Ell1ot> That's not Paige, that's a soundboard!
[2:15:39] <%jiin6> SMT 4A best SMT game
[2:15:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @forevern2dust The success of Persona games has caused the other SMT games to get less resources and sales.
[2:15:55] <+G_Thunders> So I’m nearing the end of GoW and wondering if I should pick up Monster Hunter next, is it still going strong with all its online stuff?
[2:16:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Persona is also much more ANIME than other SMT stuff.
[2:16:08] <Ser_Randal> Future Paige
[2:16:09] <Strideral> That's a lot of Big Macs
[2:16:20] <Bouldus> cum?
[2:16:20] <%jiin6> i'm happy Strange Journey redux getting a WW realease

[2:16:20] <WhiteRice92> @too_much_nukie hope the Switch SMT changes that
[2:16:21] <%commanderclaw> WHAT
[2:16:21] <@thenefftw> Ayyy
[2:16:24] <mr_slaide> If it annoys the purist idiots, I am glad that Persona is taking sales away from SMT games.

[2:16:32] <captainthunderwolf> That's pretty much it.
[2:16:32] <Kaurisen> See the difference is big macs taste like trash whereas most other mcdonald's burgers taste like garbage
[2:16:33] <+kuervojones> rooLewd
[2:16:34] <axelkaspar> McDonald's cheeseburgers are better than the Big Macs

[2:18:03] <Twoiis> elven berserker
[2:18:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> @forevern2dust For comparison, SMT 4 was a handheld title with like half the budget of P5.

[2:18:09] <Ser_Randal> Paige is a Bard
[2:18:09] <TheImmortal70> Then Rogue
[2:18:12] <+0samura1> glass canon berserker
[2:18:14] <StubYourToe> Glass barbarian
[2:18:15] <mr_slaide> Paige would be a D&D sorcerer since they're based on charisma.
[2:18:15] <$Vanessa_Ui> Duskmage
[2:18:15] <%jiin6> See perfect for barbarian
[2:18:16] <hntronium> Paige's true path is the ghost voice

[2:18:31] <Kaurisen> Paige runs a druid furry
[2:18:31] <Archaveil> paige is a girl so she'd be a healer
[2:18:31] <%rdark_ksu> Paige is the D&D version of a Chihuahua with the heart of a jack russel

[2:27:52] <@thenefftw> Okay
[2:27:53] <captainthunderwolf> @Bouldus Nah, Magran thinks you should kill soulless babies because they're worthless. The Hunting God is the one who actually creates new souls through fission, by uniting strong souls and splitting them like amoebas.
[2:27:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> Health has been simplified, UI is better.

[2:44:57] <+timblenaut> GELLARDE
[2:44:59] <captainthunderwolf> Palegina's new portrait is WEIRD
[2:45:00] <%Arxel1> I dont think she was out at night Pat
[2:45:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> She watched you run past her and said NOTHING!

[2:45:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Xoti you thirsty bitch.

[2:45:30] <$SGrim> GELLARDE DICKING

[2:45:35] <lautalocos> GELLARDE
[2:45:46] <%Mistheart101> What's "gellarde" mean
[2:45:56] <antthefool> Gellarde
[2:46:02] <TerraWraith> They don't build fortresses like these anymore. The coastline makes them open to cannon fire GOD DAMN YOU PALIGENIA
[2:46:04] <captainthunderwolf> @Mistheart101 It's like a general exclamation of surprise.
[2:46:06] <+KoyaMusa> It means gellarde
[2:46:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Exiled birf
[2:46:10] <$SGrim> Gellarde is a way of life. GELLARDE
[2:46:12] <%Mistheart101> Ohh
[2:46:26] <KTDelgado> so she no longer has the paladin class
[2:46:27] <%Fenrirlives> man her portrait art isn't nearly as good as the first one
[2:46:31] <prime_name> Goldpact Knights FTW
[2:46:38] <%ziriken> can she fly? what?
[2:46:38] <Dellago> She's still a Paladin, just not sure what kind
[2:46:56] <Dellago> Technically I mean, like in a gameplay sense
[2:46:59] <captainthunderwolf> @Mistheart101 Pallegina's scripting is bugged in Pillars 1, so every time you visit your base in the game she repeats a long line of dialogue that begins with her shouting, "Gellarde!" Everyone in chat heard it a few dozen times.
[2:46:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you can replace Aloth with this "chick"
[2:47:11] <BestTeaMaker> D:
[2:47:15] <%jiin6> hahah
[2:47:16] <hippofant> D:
[2:47:17] <captainthunderwolf> I agree, new Pallegina looks bad.
[2:47:22] <Ser_Randal> nooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:47:27] <captainthunderwolf> Like no hate to the artist, but why do that to her face????
[2:47:32] <captainthunderwolf> She looked fine?????
[2:47:33] <%jiin6> XOTI is pleased
[2:47:35] <lautalocos> good one pat
[2:47:35] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Pat is broken
[2:47:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> HA. Xoti, that's mean
[2:47:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's too good for you.
[2:47:39] <hippofant> This is what happened last time too :-/
[2:47:39] <@thenefftw> Xoti REALLY wants the dick
[2:47:39] <captainthunderwolf> Why did you go off-model???????
[2:47:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Turn off Fast Mode pat.
[2:47:56] <%badmr7> Gotta get birb girl back
[2:47:59] <captainthunderwolf> Xoti's horny.
[2:48:00] <$spacehouse> Fast Mode all the time please
[2:48:01] <reonome> she wants the dick
[2:48:03] <captainthunderwolf> That's it, roughly.
[2:48:09] <%Arxel1> Xoti is VERY THIRSTY Paige
[2:48:09] <ancrest_tant> Rejected by birb girl
[2:48:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Xoti wants Eder's dick REALLY BAD.
[2:48:10] <Strideral> Shawty doesn't want any competition towards getting THE DICK
[2:48:11] <%jiin6> Xoti's a thristy girl who wants the Bang Bang
[2:48:15] <@thenefftw> Wait
[2:48:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Xoti shows her Yandere colors
[2:48:18] <+Superstarsage> this is all pat's fault for brushing that dirt away after a nice religious soul sucking
[2:48:18] <+KennyK> Aw, I get it. Xoti is like Paige.
[2:48:21] <@thenefftw> Is Xoti just Paige?
[2:48:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Xoti is basically Paige.
[2:48:24] <dreu81> “Damn shawty”
[2:48:29] <Bouldus> xoti is jsut Paige when other women are arund
[2:48:34] <KTDelgado> xoti has two modes... horny or murder.... cool gal
[2:48:38] <aslfrasle> She's just like Paige. She has to get rid of other women to get the dick.
[2:48:48] <+mcjimbo12> Don't talk to pat about frames he'll give you all his money
[2:48:49] <Bouldus> @KTDelgado yea much liek Paige
[2:48:49] <%ziriken> pat has many frames
[2:48:55] <captainthunderwolf> @Superstarsage Think about Xoti getting hot and bothered after a horrific gremlin Pat's stooped-over dwarf wipes some dirt away from her face.
[2:49:03] <TerraWraith> Space hat?
[2:49:05] <dreu81> So. Many. Hats.
[2:49:07] <%Remery_> Space Hats>
[2:49:08] <captainthunderwolf> gremlin *like Pat's dwarf
[2:49:08] <lautalocos> get the bloodborne hat
[2:49:09] <Strideral> YEYEEY COWBOY HAT
[2:49:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Become the sexy dancer!
[2:49:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf Further solidifying the theory that Xoti is Paige
[2:49:47] <dreu81> Can you get an Egyptian pharaoh hat? Upper and lower kingdom combined?
[2:49:50] <yalwin_khales> The best dancer's outfit will always be in kotor 2.
[2:49:50] <+redstonej> got any fancy hat
[2:49:53] <+KennyK> Does this game have any combat system improvements from the first game?
[2:50:17] <%forevern2dust> Pallegina's portrait would look better if it wasn't just a cropped portion of another image.
[2:50:20] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales That game didn't let my male hero wear it and that pissed me off.
[2:50:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @KennyK The HP/Endurance split is gone, Wizards have been completely revamped, combat is a little bit slower overall.
[2:50:39] <yalwin_khales> @captainthunderwolf 2004 was a different time.
[2:50:41] <+mcjimbo12> @Too_Much_Nukie oh they got rid of hp/endurance? huh i kind of liked that
[2:50:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's all that I've noticed of significance so far.
[2:50:51] <ancrest_tant> Getting hungry is bullshit
[2:50:54] <+HDmexiqtioner> Hi Pat. Hey Chat. What's up?
[2:50:56] <Bouldus> im gonna be honest i didnt look at palle's portrait is it that different then the old portrait?
[2:51:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @mcjimbo12 There's still injuries, Aloth has a gaping wound right now, but it's just endurance.
[2:51:08] <captainthunderwolf> @forevern2dust I agree, as long as you're implying it wasn't actually meant to be a good portrait of her artistically and thus looks like what it is, a smaller piece of a larger work.
[2:51:08] <RowenCleric> I hope the controls for this are not incredibly awkward on the switch
[2:51:20] <%Remery_> @HDmexiqtioner hungry
[2:51:33] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales Whatevs, you know? Now my Jedi kills people naked. THEY did this. Not me.
[2:51:38] <PlumpPotatoRump> @hdmexiqtioner hihi o7. i just started p5 for the first time :o
[2:51:45] <+ABadIdea> Swole Net? yandThink
[2:51:52] <+HDmexiqtioner> I had Pizza. Then yesterday was my sister's wedding. But now I realize, I LOVE LOBSTER. lol
[2:51:53] <prime_name> Is that Mark Hamill?
[2:51:57] <+HDmexiqtioner> P5 is super legit.
[2:52:03] <Lee_The_Limey> Probably like a gravestone
[2:52:07] <+HDmexiqtioner> Ohh Paige is there. Hello.
[2:52:10] <%jiin6> ***
[2:52:11] <PlumpPotatoRump> Sam regel?
[2:52:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's money Pat.
[2:52:22] <%jiin6> shit sorry
[2:52:23] <%Remery_> Lobster taste better than Crabs?
[2:52:24] <Kenori> Is that Regal? That sounds like Hamill
[2:52:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ahh it's a pirate badge
[2:52:32] <+redstonej> its a penis
[2:52:34] <+ABadIdea> Could be Sam, could be Taliesen actually
[2:52:35] <%forevern2dust> I miss durance.
[2:52:40] <+HDmexiqtioner> @Remery_ Honestly after yesterday... hell yes.
[2:52:40] <ArcticAsylum> MONEY
[2:52:42] <%jiin6> Suolenet, google that
[2:52:47] <yalwin_khales> @captainthunderwolf Whatever floats your boat, though I imagine fighting unarmored is a bit of a challenge. Props to you that you can pull it off.
[2:52:49] <+HDmexiqtioner> Like Free Mone
[2:52:51] <+HDmexiqtioner> y
[2:52:55] <captainthunderwolf> A lot of the RP characters in Critical Role approach being a little cringey at times, but Nott is super legit.
[2:52:56] <ArcticAsylum> YOU'LL GET PAID IN EXPOSUREEEEE
[2:53:04] <captainthunderwolf> Sam Reigel's little goblin girl is awesome.
[2:53:07] <Worldbrand> hello pat and paige's elbow

[2:53:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wild Mare sounds like a whorehouse.
[2:53:20] <andreslazo8> Oh shoot, didn't realize Pat was streaming

[2:53:35] <+ABadIdea> MIGHTY NEIN WHEN? yandHappy
[2:53:37] <randallboone> You Whoreson
[2:53:39] <Kenori> that does not sound like Jaffe
[2:53:45] <$RubberFistFight> I missed Paige's stream but I caught Pats. So I guess it all evens out?
[2:53:47] <Kenori> No Mighty Nein in this game
[2:53:47] <Reanimator83> !uptime
[2:53:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 53m 56s.
[2:53:48] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales In case you haven't, if you ever play again, try a run as a Jedi Weapons Master. You start outputting so much damage that most enemies can't hit you in time to do damage.
[2:53:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> SHIPS
[2:53:49] <+Floorislava> woah
[2:53:50] <count_bob> HEE.
[2:53:51] <DorianCreed> BOATS
[2:53:52] <count_bob> JUNK.
[2:53:53] <%ziriken> youre poor
[2:53:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> THIS IS HOW WE GET BIGGER BOAT
[2:53:54] <Kenori> Vox Machina
[2:53:56] <Kenori> tho
[2:53:58] <Strideral> Is that boat just called Junk? lol
[2:53:58] <%commanderclaw> JUNK
[2:53:59] <captainthunderwolf> A Junk's a kind of Chinese ship.
[2:53:59] <@thenefftw> GET BIG MONEY
[2:54:00] <Bouldus> a junk is a chinese style shi[
[2:54:05] <$Chimeraelite> Yea, old Asian bote
[2:54:05] <Bouldus> ship*
[2:54:06] <TerraWraith> Out of my way, I'm a boaterist!
[2:54:08] <%jiin6> Junk Ship
[2:54:08] <Dellago> Itd be cool if they eventually did the campaign 2 characters as DLC like with Vox Machina. a Nott voice and portrait would be dope
[2:54:08] <+MrMcCrabby> buy junk
[2:54:09] <xXFlyingBrickXx> It's a Chinese ship
[2:54:09] <Nitsuj293> coxChicken
[2:54:10] <$SGrim> Junks are big and really sturdy
[2:54:10] <captainthunderwolf> I'M LOOKING FOR A MAN WHO WORKS ON CHINESE SHIPS
[2:54:11] <hntronium> BOTE SHOPPING
[2:54:12] <antthefool> Boat lord
[2:54:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> A junk is a real ship Pat.
[2:54:16] <Worldbrand> It's because the junk comes with a massive trunk
[2:54:18] <%TheHypestCripple> it's those Chinese style boats, junks
[2:54:19] <graffitisamurai> China boat
[2:54:20] <+KennyK> Its a type of Chinese Ship
[2:54:21] <%forevern2dust> what is Jibe?
[2:54:21] <Wistelligence> Yes, Pat, that's a real thing that actually exists.
[2:54:22] <+Bryanluvzyou> yea. the Junk was a chinese vessel during the Ching dynasty
[2:54:24] <+Andrizzleton> I'm looking for some sailors.
[2:54:29] <TheImmortal70> Rice is actually SUPER IMPORTANT now
[2:54:29] <$RubberFistFight> So I missed Paige's stream but I managed to catch Pats. So it allllllll works out in the end.
[2:54:30] <Kenori> I'd agree, I'd love Nott in this game, but I'd rather wait and see where their characters are going before then
[2:54:33] <asurite_warrior> damnit pat you know nothing of ships
[2:54:34] <Kenori> so maybe for PoE3
[2:54:35] <ancrest_tant> In the trunk
[2:54:35] <ArcticAsylum> Boat Master Kenny Pat
[2:54:36] <Thunderhawk47> Europeans got salty that Chinese had dopeass ships so they called them junk
[2:54:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat needs to learn his nautical terms LUL
[2:54:40] <%Remery_> Rice Cake <3
[2:54:41] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat junk is a giant chinese merchant ship. big big
[2:54:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> And those vessels looked rad as hell
[2:54:44] <Kenori> When their 2nd campaign is done
[2:54:50] <Strideral> Rice and Booze what a great mix
[2:54:52] <%forevern2dust> I'm a sailor and I don't even know what Jibe is.
[2:54:57] <Kenori> Rice and Rice
[2:55:02] <%jiin6> Booze and Rice, staple comfort foods
[2:55:02] <Kenori> no booze for yooze
[2:55:10] <TerraWraith> Yes Paige. Yeat the gun
[2:55:10] <dreu81> We made hardtack in 4th grade. It was indeed hard. And salty.
[2:55:11] <hntronium> GET DEM CANNONS
[2:55:12] <+HDmexiqtioner> You can. Only once though
[2:55:14] <Ser_Randal> You can eat gun when sad
[2:55:15] <captainthunderwolf> Tar loaf is a good thing to call your girlfriend if you want her to stop loving you.
[2:55:16] <ArcticAsylum> Bread and liquid bread
[2:55:16] <Wistelligence> paige, stop telling pat to eat a gun, that's banned on twitch
[2:55:17] <+TheShal> Can I fuck that?
[2:55:17] <%jiin6> can we get that?
[2:55:21] <Kenori> I thought I heard the old man say "LEAVE HER JOHNNY LEAVE HER"
[2:55:22] <yalwin_khales> @captainthunderwolf I've played it many times, got it a few months after it first came out, best game I've ever played. Definitely agree on the Weapon Master thing, lot of damage. That was usually my choice for prestige class.
[2:55:30] <Kenori> Tomorrow ye will get yer pay "AND ITS TIME FOR US TO LEAVE HER"
[2:55:42] <Bouldus> yeyeyeyeye
[2:55:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @forevern2dust You swing the sail across a following wind, causes a quick turn or you flip the boat.
[2:55:46] <%maskedriderhero> Man this ship customization and load out screen is making my dick hard
[2:55:46] <%jiin6> PAY THAT
[2:55:49] <Kenori> For the voyage is long and the wind don't blow and it's time for us to leave her!
[2:55:52] <Bouldus> getting a zoo just like mgsv
[2:55:52] <+HDmexiqtioner> Where da babby?
[2:55:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Usually flip the boat.
[2:56:06] <Kenori> Cannon Fucking confirmed
[2:56:14] <$RubberFistFight> @HDmexiqtioner - he's off camera, plotting.
[2:56:15] <Kenori> I thought he hated stealing
[2:56:17] <andreslazo8> He's a Pirate
[2:56:24] <Bouldus> fighter rogue, and paladin rogue are AMAZING multiclasses
[2:56:25] <%forevern2dust> @Too_Much_Nukie thanks, you are very informative
[2:56:26] <asurite_warrior> feels like the type of game you play after the main game
[2:56:29] <Worldbrand> is this game significantly more nautical themed or what
[2:56:30] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales That game has one flaw: HK-47 is not as subordinate to you, and he's less fun to be around when he's not sucking your dick. He's better written, but I enjoyed him being my bitch in the previous entry.
[2:56:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Contemplate that Diii
[2:56:35] <mr_slaide> About wanting the D.
[2:56:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> @forevern2dust I know a lot of dumb bullshit.
[2:56:42] <Reanimator83> You know your going to have to buy all this Pat.
[2:56:52] <captainthunderwolf> Meaning Aloth is worthless.
[2:56:59] <Kenori> Leave her Johnny leave her! Oh leave her Johnny Leave her.
[2:57:02] <%shinynewbuttons> Just realized that Matt and Pat's streaming icons are near identical, but Pat is dead.
[2:57:03] <+ABadIdea> Wizard/Rogue might be legit
[2:57:08] <Kenori> For the voyage is long and the wind don't blow and its time for us to leave her!
[2:57:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> He's a GUN WIZARD
[2:57:16] <dreu81> He’s a bang bang gun wizard
[2:57:16] <KTDelgado> xoti is also murder lovin whod probs like skaen
[2:57:20] <startadevy> hug floating black things
[2:57:22] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Leave her Johnny leave her!
[2:57:23] <yalwin_khales> @captainthunderwolf I prefer him being even more sassy in 2, as well as highly suspicious of T3-M4 and G0-T0, it's fun to watch.
[2:57:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bang bang! Gun Gang!
[2:57:26] <$RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie - a BULLET MAGE
[2:57:26] <%Remery_> Wizard Boxer
[2:57:44] <dreu81> Wizard tax collector
[2:57:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh fuck Pat is Bayonetta.
[2:57:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> He's dwarven Bayonetta.
[2:57:54] <Dellago> I havent heard anything yet about "bad" multiclasses, so they all seem viable
[2:57:55] <risenlp2> @AngriestPat Hey, I know it's off-topic but will you stream the next cinematic quest for Warframe when it comes out?
[2:57:55] <startadevy> enema
[2:57:55] <dreu81> LUL
[2:57:58] <%forevern2dust> No more Vancian spellcasting? Wow, that's different.
[2:57:59] <+HDmexiqtioner> What is the opinion on eating Lobster Pat and Paige?
[2:58:06] <Bloodbourneidentity> Hes a bulletwitch!!!
[2:58:06] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales G0-T0 WAS MEAN TO MY BEAUTIFUL SON T3. HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY IN THIS GAME AND G0-T0 AND HK ARE MEAN TO HIM. :(
[2:58:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> 'Cause that's where your butt is
[2:58:09] <TheImmortal70> Cause you talk such shit
[2:58:14] <Kenori> Bayo is a Gun Witch, which is a combination of Barbarian/Cipher
[2:58:18] <Kenori> with guns
[2:58:21] <+0samura1> Cuz u talk so much shit paige
[2:58:22] <Kenori> Pat is a Gun Wizard
[2:58:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> @forevern2dust There are still per rest abilities but wizards it's all per encounter now.
[2:58:28] <$RubberFistFight> @HDmexiqtioner - why not just leave Lobster Pat and Lobster Paige alone to live their lives? :P
[2:58:36] <Kenori> Pat is that one guy from the Final Fantasy Anime that casts summons with his gun.
[2:58:41] <captainthunderwolf> @Kenori Which is a combination of a Coward and a Dwarf.
[2:59:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Palm tree logs, basically.
[2:59:37] <DojimaDetective> Band of Robbers simulator 2018
[2:59:40] <@thenefftw> Big rob
[2:59:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> When you cut down a palm tree they don't have rings like most trees so instead of logs they form long strands.
[2:59:41] <captainthunderwolf> An Adra ban is a ban so hard that it removes your soul from the forum.
[2:59:42] <+HDmexiqtioner> Pat wants to live forever, so being a Lobster works out perfectly because they really don't have a lifespan. I guess nothing has been found where they have a "Died by old age" thing.
[2:59:43] <mr_slaide> FIND A DUMPSTER AND ELMO!
[2:59:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Called slats.
[2:59:45] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:56] <proof_plus> Ay pat's playing the good game!
[3:00:02] <yalwin_khales> @captainthunderwolf I like how independent he is in 2, it's a nice change from 1 where he's hardly really there in terms of character. The message he has from Bastila is very interesting to listen to.
[3:00:08] <+SydSavage> What type of cat is Elmo?
[3:00:31] <$RubberFistFight> @HDmexiqtioner - damn those immortal lobsters. No fair that THEY get biological immortality and WE, an organism that could really make that shit work, don't.
[3:00:42] <%Remery_> Dumpster cat
[3:00:50] <$RubberFistFight> @SydSavage - he's half mainecoon which is why he has fluffy feet
[3:00:54] <+mcjimbo12> liam o'brien in this game sounds like a super posh dude trying to sound like a pirate thug i don't know how i feel about it
[3:00:57] <iwasJase> has Pat found his son on this game?
[3:01:02] <%Jpdodds> TRAP DETECTED apatWhat
[3:01:10] <+SydSavage> @rubberfistfight cute! Thanks for letting me know.
[3:01:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> You mean Eder.
[3:01:24] <%commanderclaw> Pat will never use potions
[3:01:29] <captainthunderwolf> @yalwin_khales Agreed. Made me a little sad though, since I definitely played good boy Revan. I respect the writing decision to make Revan TECHNICALLY unelaborated upon in terms of alignment but HEAVILY implied to have returned to the Dark Side, but it still sucked to find out my MC basically became General Mao once I finished the game.
[3:01:31] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - that's kind of like, one of three voices he does. It's either "kinda posh thug" "kinda thuggy posh guy" or "ILLIDAN STORMRAGE"
[3:02:09] <captainthunderwolf> Liam O'Brien also does, "Sounds like a cool guy".
[3:02:10] <+HDmexiqtioner> So security?
[3:02:11] <+mcjimbo12> @RubberFistFight "Oi oi cap'n, 'ows it goin'?" vs "I SHALL NOT BE TOUCHED BY RABBLE SUCH AS YOU"
[3:02:13] <DojimaDetective> @RubberFistFight You know it's good drama when you give someone two nouns as a last name
[3:02:50] <+HDmexiqtioner> YOu people?
[3:02:57] <%AbnormalVoid> whadday mean, you people?
[3:03:07] <@thenefftw> Don't you love how friendly people are to answer all of your questions after you just walk into their home and talk to them? @AngriestPat
[3:03:07] <%jiin6> wait pat, What do you mean YOU PEOPLE?
[3:03:09] <KTDelgado> PUPPER SNUFFERS
[3:03:11] <%Arxel1> >You people CmonBruh
[3:03:14] <Lee_The_Limey> especially that dog
[3:03:16] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - Pat goes to talk to a dude and gets "I AMMMM MY SCAAARRRRRS" bellowed at top volume, dude starts to glow and shoot eyebeams everywhere.
[3:03:19] <dreu81> Bork busters
[3:03:22] <+Disfaceplank> Those dang drama people. MiniK
[3:03:24] <captainthunderwolf> I will say, out of fairness, that racism is vastly more unavoidable in a world with literal separate races.
[3:03:30] <Hispanacomida25> I'm not going to lie, I live for this ambient music in fantasy games
[3:03:34] <captainthunderwolf> It's not like, "I'm tan and he's dark."
[3:03:35] <ancrest_tant> The dog is actually the final boss
[3:03:39] <iwasJase> @Hispanacomida25 same tbh
[3:03:42] <+HDmexiqtioner> WcDonalds?
[3:03:44] <AlasterAngelo> what do you mean "you people"?
[3:03:44] <captainthunderwolf> It's, "I'm an Elf AND THAT MAN IS A SHARK."
[3:03:50] <DojimaDetective> But she's the queen of wcdonalds
[3:03:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shark King is a cool guy tho
[3:04:02] <@thenefftw> Well
[3:04:03] <@thenefftw> Yeah
[3:04:06] <+HDmexiqtioner> What about Lava lady?
[3:04:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Well no shit.
[3:04:09] <%jiin6> thats how that works pat
[3:04:11] <Bouldus> some jackass keeps stealing shit
[3:04:11] <dreu81> McDonald’s 3x/day = ASCENSION
[3:04:13] <Belutima> Kill em all Patrick, kill em all
[3:04:13] <kvnmck94> YE DRUGS GO
[3:04:16] <Strideral> BUILD BIG DRUGS
[3:04:16] <Bouldus> also WE DOOOO
[3:04:16] <+mcjimbo12> @RubberFistFight dude i have not gotten nerdchills like "I AM MY SCARS" in a long time, it was so fuckin ridiculous i loved it
[3:04:17] <%jiin6> oh oh oh me me
[3:04:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> GOD DAMN IT PAT
[3:04:19] <+KennyK> Pat you have to have guards when you just leave the door unlocked all the time
[3:04:20] <kvnmck94> Drugs an guns bois
[3:04:23] <DojimaDetective> Shark King and Lava Lady should be canon in this universe
[3:04:23] <+TheShal> GET THE CULDRON
[3:04:23] <Bouldus> wqoooooooo drugs
[3:04:24] <aslfrasle> Explosive Drugs!
[3:04:27] <+KoyaMusa> INCREDIBLE FOOD
[3:04:28] <dreu81> explosive drugs
[3:04:28] <invertedrealm> Drugs? Pat? Perish the thought! TriHard
[3:04:32] <dreu81> Do it
[3:04:44] <mr_slaide> Pat, can't you go 1 stream without promoting the use or creation of random drugs?
[3:04:45] <kvnmck94> Patl never drop the crack
[3:04:50] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat One of the reasons there's a ton of guards is A: You can steal a ton of things and B: This game has New Vegas style factions where you can piss off a big chunk of the world
[3:04:52] <%Remery_> Barge into someone's house to fuck with their chemistry set
[3:04:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kick him in his Potato
[3:04:57] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - I actually really REALLY liked the way they made the Naaru look like a bunch of psychotic assholes and showed that the Light is equally as brainwashy as Fel.
[3:05:05] <%Jpdodds> Tomato?
[3:05:05] <%jiin6> Pottatoe family
[3:05:07] <kvnmck94> whut even
[3:05:17] <PlumpPotatoRump> :o 🥔🥔🥔
[3:05:18] <%jiin6> so they're rich Irish folk
[3:05:20] <%AbnormalVoid> bippity boppity
[3:05:22] <%TenderBabyBacon> Italian potato. you mean pasta
[3:05:23] <kvnmck94> "Pip pip, ima italian potatoe, god save the queen""
[3:05:25] <%Jpdodds> The Italian potato is surely the tomato
[3:05:25] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - I've been saying for years that the Naaru should NOT be trusted and they have been lying to us. Guess we'll see when the Void Lords rear their heads.
[3:05:26] <captainthunderwolf> @mcjimbo12 Zahua has some fantastic lines in Pillars 1 on that sort of tangent. If you friendly fire him, he says, "Please, don't bother hurting me. Save your pain for the enemies; I do not wish to be selfish," and he genuinely means it.
[3:05:27] <TheImmortal70> Pat only knows how to pip pip
[3:05:32] <dreu81> Patate
[3:05:40] <+mcjimbo12> @RubberFistFight I'm kinda mixed on it. I like the idea of the Light not being fully good, but also worried that we're going to end up with "Each element is morally the same but a different colour, only the player character can be trusted"
[3:05:46] <invertedrealm> Calm down there, Leprechaun. You're being too excited by the idea of D R U G S
[3:06:07] <count_bob> I like her.
[3:06:11] <%jiin6> i love the way they say Potato
[3:06:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Batatto Potatto Lomatto Romatto
[3:06:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bobbida boopy
[3:06:31] <Bouldus> CTHULU
[3:06:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Awwwww yeah
[3:06:34] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - I, on the other hand, love the idea of the cosmic powers playing chess games with mortal lives, and the mortals say "NUH UH FUCK THIS SHIT" and go blow them up with magic axes.
[3:06:51] <lautalocos> what was that
[3:06:59] <TheImmortal70> God shit
[3:07:00] <$RubberFistFight> Coz we all know, thanks to WoW, that to beat a God you just have to smack it in the big toe for 10 minutes with sharp things and magic missiles.
[3:07:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> Ac
[3:07:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bird lady just trolled you.
[3:07:16] <captainthunderwolf> Ac = Ah.
[3:07:21] <%KodiakDJ> Hey Pat & Paige, long time fan of the Best Friends. Thank you for making my just-above-minimum wage job in the dough room of a pizza parlor much more entertaining! cheer500
[3:07:23] <Meme_Platinum> no wiping my butt without permission?
[3:07:24] <$RubberFistFight> AC/DC
[3:07:25] <dreu81> Gallarde LUL
[3:07:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> BURN
[3:07:30] <+mcjimbo12> @RubberFistFight Sure, I think the player characters/Azeroth's heroes should go fuck up everything else and forge their own futures, but also like... Light and Void should be distinct, not just the same shit but yellow/purple
[3:07:34] <captainthunderwolf> gellARDE
[3:07:50] <mr_slaide> I hope we don't have to murder everyone in that household.
[3:07:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Seems like bird god did that.
[3:07:53] <+HDmexiqtioner> How long can you grow your beard pat?
[3:08:00] <+mcjimbo12> @RubberFistFight I think that saying "it's all just energy" is kind of a cop out
[3:08:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's all just chemical energy
[3:08:18] <dreu81> vault or sexnasium?
[3:08:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Big steals.
[3:08:23] <$RubberFistFight> mcjimbo12 - Oh I don't think they occupy the same space on the moral compass or anything. Just that it's possible for them to be an equal force for bad that is aligned the opposite of the 'traditional" enemy.
[3:08:31] <TheImmortal70> Big crime about to be committed
[3:08:38] <KTDelgado> KILL HIM
[3:08:39] <$RubberFistFight> @mcjimbo12 - so you reject "IT'S ALL CHEMICALS, LOVE IS JUST CHEMICALS" then? :P
[3:08:41] <%MisterCrimson> I wouldn't be sad if you just murdered everyone in here
[3:08:59] <@thenefftw> You all want attention
[3:08:59] <%AbnormalVoid> You're BOTH Fiddlers!
[3:09:03] <%jiin6> Notice Paige Pat

[3:09:34] <$RaikenTB> Paige is jealous.
[3:09:36] <dreu81> Ugghhhhhhhhb
[3:09:41] <count_bob> Paige is a trash racoon.
[3:09:44] <%commanderclaw> You both fiddle like children in timeout
[3:09:49] <%Jpdodds> FORSAKEN\
[3:09:49] <Bouldus> Paige the trash panda
[3:09:50] <%jiin6> So pats an Otter...does he use his belly to eat?
[3:09:51] <@thenefftw> DOG
[3:09:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> DOGGO
[3:09:56] <lautalocos> FORSAKEN DOG
[3:10:00] <pectusumbra> I love that, but it's nice to have pat's furry as well
[3:10:01] <+HDmexiqtioner> DOG

[3:10:02] <invertedrealm> Great. Pat kidnapped a dog.
[3:10:03] <KTDelgado> paige is jealous pats tits are bigger
[3:10:04] <%AbnormalVoid> YEA! DOG!
[3:10:04] <+mcjimbo12> DID YOU JUST KIDNAP A DOG? PAT
[3:10:04] <$RubberFistFight> why DID Paige stop her stream? I got an email notification that she was on but I missed whatever happened.
[3:10:08] <%jiin6> thats a funny name for ELMO
[3:10:13] <Bouldus> why cant other companions have pets
[3:10:14] <+Meiou> woooooooo DOGE! wheres our DOGE COIN!
[3:10:15] <+HDmexiqtioner> DOG!
[3:10:16] <xXFlyingBrickXx> Is that dog a spawn of C'thulu with that name WutFace
[3:10:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's pronounced just like it's spelt.
[3:10:17] <+HDmexiqtioner> DOGG!
[3:10:21] <+ABadIdea> "You are carrying too many dogs."
[3:10:22] <+KennyK> That dog
[3:10:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> GIVE DOG TO EDER HE'LL LOVE IT
[3:10:26] <+Ulltraman7> YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE A DOG
[3:10:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> +2 INSIGHT +1 METAPHYSICS!?
[3:10:32] <+KennyK> That dog fucking grants you +1 Metaphysics?
[3:10:35] <%AbnormalVoid> Metaphysics? What?
[3:10:36] <dreu81> So you just have a dog in your backpack?
[3:10:40] <+KennyK> HOW DOES THAT DOG UNDERSTAND METAPHYSICS
[3:10:41] <$RubberFistFight> Meta... physics?
[3:10:43] <+KennyK> What is this lore?
[3:10:43] <@thenefftw> Pocket Cat
[3:10:43] <$RubberFistFight> how is that a stat?
[3:10:44] <invertedrealm> What the fuck? Metaphysics Dog?
[3:10:49] <+TheShal> The UNLIMITED power of METAPHYSICS
[3:10:50] <+Tokanova> woolie voice in the distance: pockeeettssss
[3:10:56] <$SGrim> @RubberFistFight personal understanding on supernatural topics
[3:11:02] <+mcjimbo12> They're probably just going out to get groceries pat put the fucking dog back
[3:11:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is going to end the game with nothing but pets and guns in his pockets.
[3:11:05] <+KennyK> You should rename him Descartes
[3:11:05] <count_bob> Pat is a freaky otter.
[3:11:06] <admiralsatan> the dog is made of drugs
[3:11:06] <dreu81> I gotta get a dog
[3:11:07] <+Disfaceplank> The dog see's all/. crendorFrog1
[3:11:09] <mr_slaide> Look in the dumpsters.
[3:11:16] <+Ulltraman7> Why would they leave a magic dog?!
[3:11:18] <%Gogogolem> Have you checked in the dumpsters for ELmo?
[3:11:18] <Bouldus> therye debuffs Kappa
[3:11:20] <$SGrim> @RubberFistFight mostly dialog/interaction related
[3:11:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> There is no Luck. Only Zuul
[3:11:24] <dreu81> Dogs saliva is loaded with DMt
[3:11:27] <$RubberFistFight> Pat stared into the void and the dog stared back
[3:11:28] <andreslazo8> There is a fantasy series I love where a huge fucking dragon shows up during a war after sleeping for centuries, thinking that it would give the humans a reminder of a dragon's power. Someone chucks an explosive-tipped crossbow bolt at its face and it instantly flees. The solder with the crossbow just says "Fucking Dragons." So it is nice when characters can just flip-off supposedly super-powerful beings.
[3:11:43] <invertedrealm> HOLY SHIT! PogChamp
[3:11:44] <%ziriken> hopefully its big crits
[3:11:56] <startadevy> like this view
[3:11:59] <%Jpdodds> @andreslazo8 Which series is that?
[3:12:10] <andreslazo8> Malazan Book of the Fallen
[3:12:24] <%Jpdodds> I'll look into it
[3:12:26] <$RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie - Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Vulgus Sildrahoor, THE TRAVELER HAS COME
[3:12:34] <%drabberfaun535> none of those fit him like a luck or charisma boost would
[3:12:34] <+HDmexiqtioner> Well is it because dogs have that 7 years to one year thing? So are dogs basically the flash.
[3:12:37] <Terran_Gell> Inflation :P
[3:12:38] <antthefool> Like my soft ass barbarian
[3:12:55] <+mcjimbo12> BIG SHOUTS
[3:12:57] <+HDmexiqtioner> like the pope
[3:12:59] <Ser_Randal> PLUME
[3:13:02] <Bouldus> int and religion hmmmm Kappa
[3:13:06] <+KennyK> That helmet goes to church more than I do

[3:13:14] <@thenefftw> Dragonborn helmet?
[3:13:22] <$Bane_Kaikyo> hello
[3:13:23] <%TenderBabyBacon> all the abilities are per rest
[3:13:24] <KTDelgado> GIVE THE FLAIL TO EDER
[3:13:33] <$RubberFistFight> @KennyK - I went to church once when I was a kid. The wine gave me hiccups.
[3:13:36] <%TenderBabyBacon> I though pat didn't like per rest abilities
[3:13:37] <%forevern2dust> I want a fedora that gives -1 to religion.
[3:13:52] <+GimmMeUhSammich> What a shitty shop owner. Here is where the better shops are, bye!
[3:13:57] <KTDelgado> GIVE THE FLAIL YOU STOLE TO EDER
[3:13:57] <+HDmexiqtioner> Are you giving her the "I can buy that for $10 at Walmart so I won't buy your commission for $90 for that helmut"
[3:13:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bow chicka bow wow
[3:14:00] <$RubberFistFight> @KennyK - also one of the much younger children I was sitting next to had pissed themself, meaning that was a fantastic 3 hours of musty church smells and PISS STENCH.
[3:14:02] <%jiin6> signs point to yes
[3:14:05] <+Tokanova> that was the fantasy version of the aristocrats
[3:14:05] <antthefool> Word she could have said fuck off
[3:14:07] <%commanderclaw> THE ARISTOCRATS
[3:14:19] <+KennyK> That sucks RubberFistFight
[3:14:22] <%jiin6> its my first day
[3:14:31] <+KennyK> but at least it was more entertaining than regular church
[3:14:35] <%jiin6> sick burn
[3:14:57] <@thenefftw> YES
[3:15:02] <%jiin6> eder come'on
[3:15:03] <Bouldus> yay
[3:15:05] <iwasJase> PAT LIKES THIS
[3:15:07] <+mcjimbo12> YOU COULD JUST SUMMON GHOSTS ON THAT DUDE TO SHOW OFF

[3:15:10] <%TenderBabyBacon> screw pat
[3:15:19] <%jiin6> STEAL HIS HEART
[3:15:21] <antthefool> LOL
[3:15:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @mcjimbo12 But Baleth helped with that.
[3:15:28] <KTDelgado> PAT GIVE EDER HIS FLAIL
[3:15:37] <Hispanacomida25> Aww he loves his doggo
[3:15:37] <$RubberFistFight> @KennyK - oh I just remembered I had to go to some church ceremony thing when I was in grade 10 because I was going to an anglican high school. Me and another guy got kicked out because we burst into laughter when we saw the dude come out in his ridiculous robe and hat and finery.
[3:16:07] <+mcjimbo12> It sucks that Berath is such a bitch because her powers are so radical
[3:16:17] <$RubberFistFight> @KennyK - was one of those things where you try to swallow the laughter and make a bunch of snorting choking sounds, and then it just forces its way out into a full-on gut laugh.
[3:16:25] <ancrest_tant> He's very fucking friendly
[3:16:26] <+KennyK> Yeah churches can be like that
[3:16:39] <deviljhojho94> Casita menas lil' house in spanish
[3:16:39] <$RubberFistFight> Seriously though if God exists he was laughing his ass off along with me
[3:16:41] <+KennyK> I went into a tiny cathedral in France once wearing a baseball cap and was actually assaulted to remove it
[3:16:48] <$RubberFistFight> this dude's costume was FUCKEN RIDICULOUS/
[3:16:50] <+KennyK> I ended up taking it off and wearing it on my shoulder
[3:16:58] <TafferAA> lol have to fight him now
[3:17:05] <PlumpPotatoRump> gj gj pat gj
[3:17:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Garbage is dissapointed
[3:17:07] <+KennyK> Because God thinks its fine if you wear the hat in church on any other part of your body apparentl
[3:17:10] <Strideral> Now you must fight!
[3:17:14] <$RubberFistFight> @KennyK - I woulda hit them with the nearest bible.

[3:46:03] <StubYourToe> the best guy is gone now

[3:46:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> The sarcasm.
[3:46:06] <Hispanacomida25> SHIIIEEET

[3:46:07] <+redstonej> basically a hype man
[3:46:07] <$SGrim> ALOTH FUCKING DELETED FOREVER LUL
[3:46:11] <$Bane_Kaikyo> A DWARVEN MASSUER WITH BIG HANS A SMOOTH VOICE!! @AngriestPat
[3:46:17] <Lee_The_Limey> A chanter is what is at soccer games like "you're shiiiiiiit and you know you are you're shiiiiiit and you know you are~"
[3:46:24] <Bouldus> @StubYourToe god i hope thats sarcasm
[3:46:27] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I feel like Howler could easily be changed to Screamlord and no one would bat an eye
[3:46:30] <Bouldus> Aloth is the worst
[3:46:31] <Iam_Dead> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:46:32] <captainthunderwolf> So is he basically just a demi-sidekick?
[3:46:36] <Darren716> Hornswoggle?!
[3:46:40] <DojimaDetective> Is there actually a difference between a sidekick and companion or is it just pats weird way of putting things
[3:46:41] <Iam_Dead> Making good choices!
[3:46:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TrevyWeaponsGuy You could mod that in I'm sure.
[3:46:49] <StubYourToe> @Bouldus Oh sure, it was sarrrcasm. no it was
[3:46:51] <$RubberFistFight> @Darren716 - what are you dating a character from fraggle rock?
[3:46:51] <captainthunderwolf> He's just a dude.
[3:46:52] <antthefool> I love this little green one
[3:46:52] <TheImmortal70> OH man cmon
[3:46:53] <elementofloyalty> Pat did Paige clean up the mess she made?
[3:46:55] <TheImmortal70> He deserves more
[3:46:56] <captainthunderwolf> BUT HE'S A COOL DUDE
[3:46:56] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @Too_Much_Nukie I need it
[3:46:57] <Dellago> Im bummed Ydwin is a sidekick, they didnt hit the kickstarter limit that wouldof made her a full companion
[3:46:59] <Strideral> That sucks
[3:47:04] <captainthunderwolf> HELL YEAH HE HAS A FINE POLE AX
[3:47:07] <%Gogogolem> A fine pole axe if you know waht i mean.
[3:47:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Swag
[3:47:09] <Darren716> Nah im going for the WWE hornswoggle
[3:47:10] <captainthunderwolf> CAUSE HE'S A PROSTITUTE
[3:47:21] <elementofloyalty> HE'S A DWARF
[3:47:25] <Eijiken> whats the name of the dapra chief VA
[3:47:31] <Lee_The_Limey> I bet he comes with a fine poleaxe Kappa
[3:47:32] <%forevern2dust> Beefcake
[3:47:35] <StubYourToe> porking up
[3:47:42] <+HDmexiqtioner> Tales of Whore Patrol
[3:47:43] <captainthunderwolf> @Eijiken I believe it's Daniel Arpachief.
[3:47:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> REBEL YELL
[3:47:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> Frenzy is required for Barbarians.
[3:47:54] <%ziriken> !uptime
[3:47:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 48m 3s.
[3:48:00] <captainthunderwolf> @Eijiken Know to some by D. Arpachief, of course.
[3:48:01] <Eijiken> I got excited for a second
[3:48:05] <$RubberFistFight> @Darren716 - whenever I hear "Hornswaggle" I think of that episode of Friends with the leather pants.
[3:48:20] <StubYourToe> thick skinned fits with him
[3:48:23] <Eijiken> he's been in other stuff and its going to bother me
[3:48:27] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Man, I really need that monk/barbarian multiclass in my life
[3:48:39] <TheImmortal70> Biggerer
[3:48:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Womp Wooomp
[3:49:02] <captainthunderwolf> @Eijiken I aim to please. It's probably on either IMDB or the game's wiki, if not now, then soon enough. Actually, just Google the game's credits, I'm sure they're in circulation.
[3:49:20] <%Remery_> Could you have recruited Firecrotch?
[3:49:25] <TheImmortal70> So throw wild sprint on, swap targets
[3:49:31] <%commanderclaw> "That was some good sex, wanna go on an adventure?"
[3:49:33] <+HDmexiqtioner> Going to head out for the night. Have a good night everyone. See ya later Pat and Paige. :)
[3:49:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wild Sprint got a buff I see.
[3:49:45] <StubYourToe> @HDmexiqtioner Cya brah
[3:49:46] <%Mistheart101> The thicc of it
[3:49:51] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Greg Eagles?
[3:49:51] <PlumpPotatoRump> @hdmexiqtioner cya, stay safe o7
[3:49:54] <%Remery_> @HDmexiqtioner later
[3:50:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can you make the massuse and the furry fuck?
[3:50:11] <+neeto_makar> Is that for real the Darpa Chief? That might legitimately push me over the edge to buy this game lmao.
[3:50:15] <captainthunderwolf> @HDmexiqtioner Have a good one, man.
[3:50:20] <mr_slaide> Aloth is such an asshole.
[3:50:21] <TheImmortal70> Not to be confused with his dick fuckery
[3:50:25] <Eijiken> greg eagles fuck yeah
[3:50:27] <KTDelgado> FIND THE SON NOW
[3:50:47] <mr_slaide> FIND ELMO!
[3:50:49] <MonsieurHedge> companions are baldurs gate companions, sidekicks are skyrim companions
[3:50:54] <aslfrasle> Just remember the last thing Aloth saw before you left him forever was you fucking his old friend/boyfriend.
[3:50:56] <dreu81> I really enjoy watching this game. But I doubt I’d enjoy playing it.
[3:51:00] <turbulentstriker> Hot take: Too much voice acting is harmful to pure RPGs like this game
[3:51:06] <KTDelgado> not that son but peepee too
[3:51:14] <Dellago> That and Eder, Aloth, and Pallegina can all die in Pillars 1. So thats three potential companions down
[3:51:21] <TheImmortal70> If the VA ing is bad sure, but this is done well, and adds to character
[3:51:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> FIND MR PEEPEE
[3:51:23] <+bumbletroni> Elmo better be a sidekick and not a pet
[3:51:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Elmo is a pet.
[3:51:39] <+ABadIdea> ALWAYS run Agrias tho yandGasp
[3:51:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> If he was a sidekick he'd never get used.
[3:51:43] <KTDelgado> PAT THE GUY IS IN THERE, FIND HIM
[3:51:44] <+mcjimbo12> @turbulentstriker I agree to some extent, but the VA is really good for the most part in this game. Sometimes it's nice to give people their own voices though
[3:51:46] <%forevern2dust> The same voice actor as grim from Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
[3:51:51] <%Keyd00d> he awakens
[3:52:01] <mr_slaide> Dah babuh
[3:52:03] <Hispanacomida25> HE WOKE
[3:52:05] <$RubberFistFight> E L M O
[3:52:06] <TheImmortal70> The holy elmo
[3:52:08] <%Mistheart101> THE BABY
[3:52:09] <%TenderBabyBacon> He must come
[3:52:10] <dreu81> The baaaaaaaabeeeee
[3:52:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> OUR BAAAAAABY
[3:52:12] <turbulentstriker> @TheImmortal70 Its not necessarily about quality, its more about the cost. A lot of content has to be culled in order to make up for the cost of having VAs.
[3:52:12] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Hurry or he scream
[3:52:12] <StubYourToe> He cometh
[3:52:13] <%Remery_> PREAPRE FOR ELMO
[3:52:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Don't you blueball me.
[3:52:15] <@thenefftw> ELMO

[3:52:40] <$OmegaWeltall> BEEB BEEB
[3:52:41] <+zaworldo> good boi
[3:52:42] <antthefool> *inhales* AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[3:52:44] <Eijiken> thank you @forevern2dust i knew it was something fairly non video gamey, although his credits reads like a novel
[3:52:46] <+Ulltraman7> THE BABY
[3:52:47] <admiralsatan> who got pat cat pregnant?
[3:52:47] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He hates it
[3:52:47] <dreu81> Elmo Gaiden
[3:52:48] <OrnateBee> BEEP BEEP
[3:52:51] <+Andrizzleton> *speaks in Toxoplasmosis*
[3:52:54] <KTDelgado> PAT THE QUEST GUY IS IN THERE
[3:52:56] <TheImmortal70> @turbulentstriker Except the VA's deserve that cash, because a lot of developers fuck them over because they don't recognize the value of "acting"
[3:52:59] <yalwin_khales> Honk Honk Beep Beep
[3:53:02] <%maskedriderhero> One of these days Pat is going to stuff Paige into a closet so he can take sole pownership of the baby
[3:53:02] <MrPedrovsky> @AngriestPat are you gonna stream long cuz it's 3:50 AM in Moscow and i have work lol
[3:53:03] <%commanderclaw> Watch Elmo be in the last level of the supedungeon
[3:53:03] <+mugwugsampoo> GOWKratos GOWKratos GOWKratos GOWKratos
[3:53:05] <$RubberFistFight> @admiralsatan - paige has a giant barbed cat penis
[3:53:07] <%Remery_> Need more Elmo Lore in my life.
[3:53:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> There's a Quest guy here? In the brothel?
[3:53:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's a party member.
[3:53:46] <turbulentstriker> @TheImmortal70 That's not really the point, i only care about the game itself. I would prefer having more written content if I had to sacrifice voices
[3:54:05] <StubYourToe> I dig the fantasy Italian
[3:54:07] <%forevern2dust> Fun fact: Toxoplasmosis makes people more risk adverse. This was discovered after a study found out there was a high number of motorcycle deaths among those affected.
[3:54:28] <%Remery_> What does Elmo smell like?
[3:54:36] <%forevern2dust> toilet water
[3:54:39] <deviljhojho94> ITS A HUSTLE
[3:54:42] <Bouldus> hes about to get stabbed thats who he is
[3:54:47] <TheImmortal70> @turbulentstriker The point is that it detracts from the game yeah yeah, but this game has plenty. If everything had unlimited money sure they'd be better. What I'm saying is they have enough with the kickstarter, and that the VAs deserve their fair due, even if that may cut content
[3:54:47] <$RubberFistFight> @forevern2dust - yup, it literally sabotages your fear response.
[3:54:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> This guy is a swindler.
[3:54:58] <goatlord_> @AngriestPat do you know about the randomizer mod for REmake?
[3:54:59] <StubYourToe> ac
[3:55:22] <$RubberFistFight> @forevern2dust - they found that mice that don't have it run in fear from the smell of cat urine. Mice that DO have it run TOWARD the cat pee.
[3:55:47] <archxeno> ac?
[3:55:54] <Lee_The_Limey> Damn ol' gil needs to distribute these bounties
[3:56:01] <Eijiken> yeah toxioplasmosis makes rats and other things run TOWARD feline urine/fecal matter
[3:56:04] <%maskedriderhero> Never seen someone who WANTS to pay people, and no one is taking
[3:56:19] <MrPedrovsky> @AngriestPat are you gonna stream long cuz it's 3:50 AM in Moscow and i have work lol
[3:56:24] <Loinclothiclese> i really like abocco hes koo
[3:56:27] <KTDelgado> HE MENTIONS MERYL THE MAD PWT
[3:56:29] <$RubberFistFight> @Eijiken - well it makes sense that it would work that way given that it's trying to spread itself
[3:56:43] <%Remery_> Animancer?
[3:56:44] <KTDelgado> YOU KNOW WHERE SHE AT PAT
[3:56:45] <$RubberFistFight> making it so rodents are no longer afraid of their natural predator is a good strategy
[3:56:45] <+ABadIdea> Sounds like Obby the Rat yandGasp
[3:56:47] <TheImmortal70> Go the fuck to sleep
[3:56:58] <Bouldus> @MrPedrovsky night mate :)
[3:56:59] <buttdirt> go to bread
[3:57:02] <MrPedrovsky> Good night @AngriestPat and chat <3 <3
[3:57:14] <TheImmortal70> Ach.
[3:57:18] <TheImmortal70> Written Ac
[3:57:21] <Wistelligence> TWEET SWEET BABY
[3:57:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat loves his son
[3:57:21] <PlumpPotatoRump> @mrpedrovsky Nightnight o7
[3:57:23] <archxeno> ak ak ak ak!
[3:57:27] <Eijiken> yeah, its one of many reasons cats are horrific for the ecosystem, they fuck shit up super hard
[3:57:42] <%SoundShower> @mrpedrovsky night dude!
[3:57:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN
[3:57:48] <%MisterCrimson> KAAHAHHAHAHHHHNNNNNN
[3:57:53] <$RubberFistFight> @Eijiken - wait, how is it CAT'S faults? They didn't create toxoplasmosis.
[3:58:00] <PlumpPotatoRump> thaaaaaat is marisha
[3:58:07] <$RubberFistFight> They're just lucky enough for it to not affect them if they have it.
[3:58:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cats don't fuck up the ecosystem.
[3:58:16] <Eijiken> I mean we didn't create e.coli but its in our poop
[3:58:20] <+Ulltraman7> That is Mercer's wife
[3:58:22] <Eijiken> e coli*
[3:58:22] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Cats fuck up the ecosystem. Not as bad as us, though.
[3:58:27] <Lee_The_Limey> it's probably Aloth here Kappa
[3:58:30] <+Aeoneth> @AngriestPat are you going to stream any Destiny 2: Warmind DLC stuff this week? OR are you completely out and disinterested in that game again?
[3:58:39] <Wistelligence> this game's writing is gr8
[3:58:47] <%Mistheart101> Cats fuck up the animal side of the ecosystem. They can kill like, thousands of things a year in total.
[3:58:54] <$RubberFistFight> cats do not fuck up the ecosystem, stop it with that nonsense, they've existed in the wild for fucking centuries and get on just fine with the native life in the areas they're not invasive
[3:58:57] <Eijiken> wow not a link twitch.And stray cats destroy local ecosystems by just killing off small wildlife for funsies
[3:59:12] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> There was a mass extinction event of birds on some island that they traced back to a single cat named Snowflake, who killed, it is estimated, around 1,000 birds a day.
[3:59:14] <archxeno> do you need to play the first game to understand this?
[3:59:22] <TheImmortal70> There are literally tiny spotted cats that have the highest hunt rate
[3:59:27] <$RubberFistFight> cats in countries where they don't naturally occur are an ecological threat but only in the same way that an animal from country A can fuck the ecosystem in country B - it's not unique to felines.
[3:59:30] <DraxTD> the voltron of lies!
[3:59:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> That doesn't destroy local ecosystems, the small life they kill are plentiful.
[3:59:45] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:48] <+ABadIdea> is that Marisha? yandThink
[3:59:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> Any foreign life introduced to a new ecosystem will cause an imbalance though.
[3:59:53] <ToneBacas> never put your dick in crazy
[4:00:00] <Lee_The_Limey> Snowflake sounds like a true warrior
[4:00:03] <Eijiken> was more pointing at the domesticated housecat as opposed to felines in general because duh
[4:00:05] <+ABadIdea> or is that Laura? yandThink
[4:00:08] <%commanderclaw> Yeah, that's definitely marisha
[4:00:08] <PlumpPotatoRump> @abadidea uh huh :D
[4:00:09] <$RubberFistFight> Rabbits are a much, MUCH bigger ecological menace but nobody ever actually talks about that
[4:00:19] <PlumpPotatoRump> @abadidea marisgha
[4:00:27] <+CraigForever> hey Pat
[4:00:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Domesticated housecats don't either though, they're not even fully domesticated technically speaking.
[4:00:30] <Lee_The_Limey> A toast to snowflake, warrior cat supreme!
[4:00:31] <+ABadIdea> i thought so, she kinda sounds like Beau yandGasp
[4:00:42] <$RubberFistFight> @Eijiken - how the fuck can domesticated housecats destroy the ecosystem? If you're gonna make arguments then make sure they actually make sense.
[4:00:53] <TheImmortal70> OOOH THAT"S BAD
[4:00:54] <$RubberFistFight> If you don't like cats just admit it.
[4:01:10] <KTDelgado> HES A FUCKING ANIMANCER
[4:01:17] <StubYourToe> *tip*
[4:01:20] <Eijiken> the biggest struggle in my life is how I constantly date people who are allergic to cats and im a cat person
[4:01:24] <TheImmortal70> He is literally edging towards soul fuckery
[4:01:27] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Cats are prolific predators and there's a lot more them than would occur naturally because we keep them as pets. This can be a problem in some areas.
[4:01:33] <Eijiken> ^
[4:01:36] <%Mistheart101> No lady, Pat's ALWAYS weird.
[4:01:37] <TyrantBelial> Pat tyou're reading it incorrectly.
[4:01:40] <TheImmortal70> Old elf probably soul fucked himself
[4:01:43] <Mrbaconator> fuck aloph
[4:01:45] <Ssaik> oh no, not Aloth!
[4:01:49] <TyrantBelial> No one likes *Xoti*. not the other way
[4:01:54] <%Remery_> poke his bum
[4:01:57] <applesonthemoon> hmmmm i wonder why aloth doesnt like us LUL
[4:02:00] <Lee_The_Limey> Aloth you shit stick
[4:02:00] <$RubberFistFight> @cereal_box_conspiracy - but what you've just described can be attributed to multiple non-native invasive species, like rabbits or foxes.
[4:02:10] <count_bob> @RubberFistFight I have a link for you about cats if you want.
[4:02:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> The thing about domestic cats is that they're very adaptive, and typically mimic the animals around them. This is why they were never fully domesticated and instead just kind of latched onto humanity when we started building cities.
[4:02:32] <StubYourToe> Cats only meow to people
[4:02:33] <$RubberFistFight> jesus, even stray DOGS do damage.
[4:02:36] <StubYourToe> apparently
[4:02:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> They evolved to fit inside of our pre-existing social circles without human influence.
[4:02:46] <dreu81> Salt family? Like the FGC?
[4:02:47] <$RubberFistFight> Newsflash - put a bunch of animals where they don't belong and they make a mess.
[4:02:58] <+ABadIdea> The GENTLEMAN!? yandFear
[4:03:03] <%commanderclaw> God, Xoti is so fucking thirsty
[4:03:06] <@thenefftw> Ayy
[4:03:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's every animal, not cats in particular. Which was the argument posed.
[4:03:15] <TheImmortal70> Cmon man, this guy is literally in with the Eder and Xoti crowd
[4:03:16] <PlumpPotatoRump> @abadidea that what i was thinking xS
[4:03:18] <Lee_The_Limey> Salt family sounds like the second name they suggested for the best friends channel Kappa
[4:03:20] <$SGrim> Xoti wants even more dick now. She's unstoppable WutFace
[4:03:24] <Wistelligence> he hid it under his sack
[4:03:25] <miguelrod777> his ass
[4:03:32] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Ancient cats were definitely kept against their will. Cats weren't very friendly when we first domesticated them, and were kept on leashes around grain stores and would have been agressive to humans.
[4:03:35] <StubYourToe> "just kidding" totally from his ass
[4:03:39] <iwasJase> i like this guy
[4:03:47] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Dogs, on the other hand, probably followed us for our food.
[4:04:00] <@thenefftw> It's tue
[4:04:01] <Bouldus> you dont say
[4:04:02] <Ssaik> b-baka
[4:04:05] <Lee_The_Limey> Serafen fooled Mr Shakedown
[4:04:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dog domestication is actually very well-documented.
[4:04:06] <%ziriken> our first fortnite?
[4:04:10] <Eijiken> but also, housecats kinda just kill shit for fun. also, they have few predators outside of your foxes/wolves/coyotes, etc, and we introduced the complication of that cat just being able to fuck off inside the house when shit gets real
[4:04:12] <%ziriken> sounds trendy
[4:04:12] <%commanderclaw> WOW
[4:04:12] <Wistelligence> D A M N

[4:04:58] <blackorchidKI2> THAT'S A SEX THING
[4:05:00] <$RubberFistFight> I'm not gonna sit here and insist that non-native feline life doesn't hurt native wildlife when there's large colonies of the former, that'd be ridiculous. I just hate the "zomg cats are evil because they turn countries into wastelands" logic because it's asinine and ignores all the other invasive wildlife that do the same OR WORSE.
[4:05:07] <TheImmortal70> God bullshit
[4:05:07] <$RubberFistFight> Like the cane toad, here in Australia
[4:05:24] <Eijiken> sorry you have to deal with those, i hear its ridiculous
[4:05:31] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Cats are amazing because they're pure predator, wrapped up in a fuzzy wittle ball of purrs and cuddles.
[4:05:47] <TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Basically a woman with her mouth sewn shut had that put on her when they realized she was a cipher, except she still spoke through it of Eothas, then promptly disappeared as ghosts/god bullshit is wont to do
[4:05:53] <Eijiken> but not saying that cats are the devil, can't wait to date someone who is ok with them, and they are my speed
[4:05:57] <$RubberFistFight> @cereal_box_conspiracy - housecats can't hunt for shit. Source: laughing my ass off at my 3 housecats every time they try and hunt.
[4:05:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're predators that are successful through mimicry and adaptation.
[4:06:06] <%maskedriderhero> Yes Pat, put the shackles on the black guy, that was a good idea
[4:06:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Which is somewhat unique.
[4:06:10] <elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat BEWARE OF BLOOD CLOTS FROM SITTING TOO LONG
[4:06:13] <TheImmortal70> Put the hat back, put it back!
[4:06:14] <StubYourToe> cool
[4:06:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Looks better without the cape.
[4:06:28] <archxeno> @elementofloyalty he is already dead
[4:06:30] <reonome> yeah talk to paige
[4:06:35] <elementofloyalty> Elmo?
[4:06:36] <StubYourToe> !uptime
[4:06:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 6m 45s.
[4:06:37] <%Remery_> Talk to that Hooters employee
[4:06:38] <iwasJase> LUL
[4:06:41] <TheImmortal70> Blood clots from sitting too long?
[4:06:45] <elementofloyalty> BABY
[4:06:45] <Eijiken> cats are just really good at min/maxing and have almost no level cap besides death
[4:06:47] <Bouldus> the babyyyyyyy
[4:06:51] <elementofloyalty> ELMO EAT THE MIC
[4:06:51] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Some house cats suck at hunting, sure. So do some barn cats, even. But I've had a few cats in my lifetime that would kill quite a few little rodents, despite being well-fed.
[4:06:55] <$RubberFistFight> Oh and for the record, all of my cats are strictly indoor cats - I won't let them out to be run over by a car, torn apart by a dog, or give them the chance to kill native birds.
[4:06:57] <KTDelgado> THE QUEST GUY IS IN THERE I THINK
[4:07:03] <applesonthemoon> even the death level cap has been pushed by cats
[4:07:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cats enjoy playing with corpses.
[4:07:10] <iwasJase> ANALis.
[4:07:13] <elementofloyalty> meow
[4:07:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> And making corpses to play with.
[4:07:15] <Lee_The_Limey> HEEEER
[4:07:25] <Ser_Randal> he is in the closet
[4:07:34] <Lee_The_Limey> Like R Kelly
[4:07:36] <+redstonej> ELMO should have been a god in this game
[4:07:37] <elementofloyalty> fuk I miss Baby
[4:07:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> He's totally in the closet.
[4:07:48] <Eijiken> @RubberFistFight basically that's all I stand on my soapbox for. respect people who do that
[4:08:04] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> My friend's cat grew morbidly obese because it would eat the neighbor's food. It was also an amazing birder. Eventually it got so fat it could barely walk. It adopted an "ambush" style of bird hunting and would deliver the final kill by crawling over the injured bird and smothering it to death in it's massive rolls of fat.
[4:08:07] <TheImmortal70> Yeeep. He fuckedu p
[4:08:23] <iwasJase> he dead af
[4:08:31] <$RubberFistFight> @Eijiken - yeah. It ruins my goddamn week when I see a dead cat by the road, and it makes me like... WHITE-HOT RAGE when people say it's "cruel" to keep a cat inside your house.
[4:08:38] <elementofloyalty> Armoire?
[4:08:46] <reonome> dresser
[4:08:50] <@thenefftw> Whenever a quest asks you to find someone, good chance is that they're dead
[4:08:53] <TheImmortal70> @cereal_box_conspiracy That's funny, terrible, and frankly infuriating. Your friend needed to take care of their cat better.
[4:08:53] <elementofloyalty> Meow
[4:09:00] <$RubberFistFight> You know what's cruel? Letting your cat roam and shutting it outside, so it can get hit by a car and die in agony wondering why its owner abandoned it. THAT'S cruelty.
[4:09:16] <elementofloyalty> Elmo JUMP
[4:09:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> @cereal_box_conspiracy A lot of cats learn to imitate birdcalls, they don't sound like birds at all to me but it works.
[4:09:18] <%Fenrirlives> Lmao FUCK NEOGAF
[4:09:25] <I_ron_butterfly> my cat likes going outside
[4:09:25] <$RubberFistFight> It's statistical fact that indoor cats are healthier, happier and live longer on average than cats that are allowed to roam outside.
[4:09:35] <%jiin6> out door cats can kill native species
[4:09:36] <%Mistheart101> man y'all this is a bummer of a conversation
[4:09:39] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> How do you statistically measure cat happiness?
[4:09:40] <StubYourToe> There are a lot of happy indoor/outdoor cats
[4:09:49] <TheImmortal70> Oh FUCK
[4:09:54] <TheImmortal70> He REALLY got in there
[4:10:01] <%Remery_> Aslong as your cat has a partner, it has no need to go outside
[4:10:02] <TheImmortal70> He's definitely been wasted
[4:10:04] <iwasJase> yup, totally dead
[4:10:05] <I_ron_butterfly> am i evil for letting my cat out when she wants to go out? shes chipped and wears a little bell monkaS
[4:10:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @cereal_box_conspiracy Usually when they talk about that in studies they're talking about how active an animal is throughout the day.
[4:10:14] <elementofloyalty> Number of purrs
[4:10:21] <%ziriken> you insert the meter and it tells you
[4:10:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> And their body language.
[4:10:25] <StubYourToe> measure the number of meows per day
[4:10:36] <StubYourToe> awwww
[4:10:41] <elementofloyalty> GROSS
[4:10:44] <Eijiken> noooooooo
[4:10:45] <ToneBacas> when cats are dying they purr
[4:10:45] <@thenefftw> STOP
[4:10:48] <+KoyaMusa> Paige ran over that cat
[4:10:49] <$RubberFistFight> @I_ron_butterfly - if you just let your cat run around outside completely unsupervised? Yeah. Yeah I think you are.
[4:10:50] <%Remery_> HAHAH SICK WTF
[4:10:51] <pth88> Is this game full of the lame backer stories too
[4:10:55] <elementofloyalty> ELMO SUFFERS
[4:10:55] <%Jpdodds> Please stop.
[4:10:56] <$Chimeraelite> So like people? @AngriestPat
[4:10:56] <StubYourToe> poor kitty
[4:10:57] <fairore> fuck
[4:11:00] <%maskedriderhero> Elmo suffer
[4:11:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @pth88 No, thank god.
[4:11:02] <%commanderclaw> @pth88 No, not this time
[4:11:05] <reonome> wow cats are dumb
[4:11:07] <elementofloyalty> needing moms teat
[4:11:09] <Nitsuj293> Cats purr when they are hurt
[4:11:11] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I love the phrase "making biscuits."
[4:11:12] <archxeno> he was happy
[4:11:12] <%Keyd00d> paige pls
[4:11:17] <wolfofsound> @AngriestPat I grew up on a farm too paige, you learn some tough life lessons early
[4:11:18] <FairOnFire> Purring actually releases endorphins, which can act like a painkiller
[4:11:22] <Maldoree> @AngriestPat Cats also purr when they are in pain too
[4:11:24] <StubYourToe> @cereal_box_conspiracy me too
[4:11:26] <yalwin_khales> Elmo is a tsun-tsun.
[4:11:36] <elementofloyalty> Elmo is drunk on Purrs
[4:11:41] <%SaltyDongs> Making pancakes
[4:11:42] <%maskedriderhero> Punished Elmo
[4:11:42] <+fizzguy47> FINALLY, AN END TO THE SUFFERING! *purr*
[4:11:49] <pth88> Whats with the odd characters in some of the dialogue
[4:11:55] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat the reason being is most higher order mammals flood their brains with dopamine when they expect to die. Thus, happiness in the face of danger.
[4:12:08] <%Keyd00d> wow
[4:12:09] <StubYourToe> @fizzguy47 That's pretty funny lol
[4:12:19] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - what Paige is describing is a comfort behaviour. Kittens do that action with their paws to express milk from their mother - they learn to associate it with comfort and happiness, and it becomes a thing they do either when they are really really content, or when they're in distress and trying desperately to feel better. And I think my heart just broke typing that sentence.
[4:12:27] <I_ron_butterfly> @RubberFistFight but like, she always comes back. she cuddles, she never brings back any kind of animal, and i feed her all the time. how is treating my cat well and letting her go outside to sit under my car evil? lol you sound like a crazy person
[4:12:27] <+fizzguy47> so mammals are Blood Knights?
[4:12:29] <startadevy> or an expensive bathroom
[4:12:41] <$Bane_Kaikyo> "bent over the bulwark, giving them a taste of my inars"..... wow what a slut
[4:12:44] <TheImmortal70> Super is
[4:12:46] <%zaworldo> TIME TO STOP TALKING ABOUT DEATH CATS
[4:12:49] <StubYourToe> what a hotty
[4:12:52] <$RubberFistFight> @I_ron_butterfly - neat. Tell me how she's supposed to fight back against a car or a large dog.
[4:12:53] <%zaworldo> SOMEONE CHANGE DA SUBJECC
[4:12:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Bane_Kaikyo lol
[4:12:56] <+Ulltraman7> That's Sam Riegel
[4:12:58] <applesonthemoon> you are in luck for fucks my friend
[4:12:58] <dkthefriend> It's Sam Riegel, Pat
[4:13:07] <iwasJase> Sam Riegel
[4:13:10] <startadevy> i know how these san francisco start ups are
[4:13:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Xoti's like "Yeah dick!"
[4:13:18] <@thenefftw> Xoti wants to fuck badly
[4:13:28] <+Kyma1020> That’s not Liam it’s Sam Riegal
[4:13:30] <theholymuffin22> cats can just run away really fast and climb trees
[4:13:37] <elementofloyalty> PAIGE SPEAKS
[4:13:39] <+fizzguy47> Eder giving her blue cooch?
[4:13:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Grim looks cool as hell.
[4:13:55] <Donk2x> where is Paige?
[4:13:56] <+redstonej> Keep it in your pants Xoti
[4:14:03] <elementofloyalty> @peachsaliva when you going to play Gal Gun 2?
[4:14:12] <%maskedriderhero> Did you know the higher up a cat falls from, the more likely it is to land on it's feet and be fine?
[4:14:18] <invertedrealm> You can feel his rippling hard abs through his voice. PunOko
[4:14:18] <Dellago> Its fun having gotten into Critical Role being able to recognize their voices in things. Sam Reigel is such a go to for anime protagonists in dubs
[4:14:24] <%maskedriderhero> So drop a cat from the stratosphere and it will become immortal
[4:14:41] <TheImmortal70> Cipher fuckin messes with your mental faculties
[4:14:47] <StubYourToe> Like Empaths from Star Trej
[4:14:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Being a Cipher in Pillars is great.
[4:14:48] <StubYourToe> k
[4:14:51] <$RubberFistFight> @maskedriderhero - because they can twist their body around real fast. The reason a short fall is more likely to hurt them is they can't complete their spin and wind up hitting the ground sideways.
[4:15:01] <%SaltyDongs> The gulls
[4:15:04] <TheImmortal70> A cipher watcher is literally an equivalent of a god
[4:15:09] <$RubberFistFight> Fun fact: cats don't have collarbones.
[4:15:11] <TheImmortal70> You see everything
[4:15:18] <%SaltyDongs> ThE bIrDs
[4:15:19] <elementofloyalty> Unless you get contacts
[4:15:24] <%jiin6> can't go what you're already are
[4:15:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's SO MUCH DIALOGUE for being a cipher.
[4:15:26] <dkthefriend> You ment another not-crazy one in tthe White Marches
[4:15:28] <%Mistheart101> UPLOAD THE ELMO PICTURE WHILE YOU'RE GONE
[4:15:29] <elementofloyalty> SMOTHER HER TO SLEEP
[4:15:30] <I_ron_butterfly> @RubberFistFight she runs..? my cat isnt an idiot lol she doesnt go into the street, and dogs are hardly a problem in my area. just because someone cares for a cat differently, doesnt mean they're evil lol but hey, i guess i can't argue with the official Twitch cat master
[4:15:33] <%flying_hipp0> butts
[4:15:34] <Strideral> Big dumps
[4:15:37] <applesonthemoon> drop paige off at the bed
[4:15:38] <Dellago> The plot of Pillars 1 was pretty much just "Try not to go crazy"
[4:15:39] <ThatRandomGuy661> Don't drop the TP
[4:15:42] <startadevy> Clappy
[4:15:44] <TheImmortal70> Gotta put her to sleep
[4:15:47] <$spacehouse> drop paige into the toilet
[4:15:47] <Eijiken> i'm a SHAPESHIFTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[4:15:58] <Psych_man13_13> !raffle?
[4:16:07] <dreu81> Wow. Next time I take a huge dump I’m gonna say that too.
[4:16:11] <+other_badger> !uptime
[4:16:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 16m 20s.
[4:16:16] <$RubberFistFight> @I_ron_butterfly - I'm done discussing this with you. The conversation's not going to go anywhere good if it continues.
[4:16:17] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Why is Elmo laballed as "peepee"?
[4:16:20] <%Remery_> So has anyone eaten Dinner yet? :)
[4:16:21] <applesonthemoon> yea pat try not to drop an entire roll of toilet paper into the toilet while doing your weird toilet paper ritual
[4:16:23] <%MisterCrimson> He's busy creating turd island
[4:16:31] <$RubberFistFight> @cereal_box_conspiracy - that's his weird nickname paige game him
[4:16:33] <$RubberFistFight> gave*
[4:16:40] <StubYourToe> "Gotta put her to bed" new euphemism for taking a dumpo
[4:16:42] <Eijiken> I have P5 sealed and I want to start it soon
[4:16:45] <elementofloyalty> Pat kisses Peach goodnight with mustard on his lips.
[4:16:55] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Gotta drop the kids off at the pool.
[4:17:00] <Bouldus> @cereal_box_conspiracy she was drunk
[4:17:04] <fairore> @rubberfistfight @i_ron_butterfly ugh just fuck already !!
[4:17:07] <%maskedriderhero> Fun Fact: Cat's rub their faces on you because they have special scent flans all over their face, and they are marking you as their property/territory
[4:17:07] <$RubberFistFight> @elementofloyalty - i think pat hates mustard more than rake yohn does.
[4:17:21] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> @maskedriderhero disputed
[4:17:26] <StubYourToe> Mustard on pineapple pizza covered in pepperoni
[4:17:29] <%Remery_> @maskedriderhero so I'm being dominated?
[4:17:34] <elementofloyalty> Rake Yohn has no ass like Paige
[4:17:49] <%maskedriderhero> @cereal_box_conspiracy Your cat doesn't love you, he just wants to get his stank all over you! Accept the truh!
[4:17:52] <Eijiken> I just want to gert some P5 pointers on missables and such before i dive into the game blind
[4:17:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Remery_ That's not really the case.
[4:17:54] <Bouldus> cats dont like me, i feel like its because of the multiple dog smells
[4:17:57] <$RubberFistFight> @maskedriderhero @cereal_box_conspiracy - actually that's half true. SOMEtimes it's a scent gland thing, other times it's just a show of affection. It depends which part of his face he's using.
[4:18:01] <Eijiken> i'm weird and love optimized plays of games
[4:18:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cats also tend to mark things they like anyway.
[4:18:20] <elementofloyalty> Shelmo gets no more love god damit
[4:18:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> You don't want to own shitty people.
[4:18:44] <$RubberFistFight> If they use the side of their face, it's a scent gland thing. If they use the top of their head, it's pure affection and the cutest thing ever. They call that "bunting"
[4:18:48] <%MisterCrimson> @Bouldus no, I have two dogs that rub up on me all the time. When I go to my grandmother's place her cats run right to me too. I think it's just your soul
[4:19:02] <Bouldus> lol
[4:19:10] <%jiin6> P5 Tips, pay attention and Take your Time
[4:19:13] <StubYourToe> I love when cats do stretches
[4:19:15] <Bouldus> dogs love me though, and thats all the matters
[4:19:16] <%Mistheart101> Animals are good at reading people.
[4:19:16] <elementofloyalty> HUmans have souls?
[4:19:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[4:19:27] <fairore> @mistercrimson whoa
[4:19:30] <elementofloyalty> They do have tacos
[4:19:32] <%Mistheart101> We adopted a second dog for a bit (returned him because he needed more activity than we could provide) and he fucking hated my brother.
[4:19:36] <StubYourToe> We are just chemicals
[4:19:37] <Eijiken> @jiin6 i see what you did there
[4:19:49] <%Mistheart101> My brother being a kleptomaniac with anger issues and a severe case of pathological lying.
[4:19:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> This theme is so relaxing
[4:20:01] <StubYourToe> @GarbageQueenEllie I like it too
[4:20:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cats and dogs, most animals really, respond to body language more than anything else.
[4:20:08] <Eijiken> that and holy fuck the music is so good in the game i just want to get started on it
[4:20:10] <$RubberFistFight> @Mistheart101 - they're much better at assessing physical body language than humans are. Like, we still have the talent but for some reason we ignore what it tells us. That's why people so often don't get out of bad situations that turn into fights and instead try to defuse the situation before it gets there.
[4:20:11] <$SGrim> @StubYourToe incorrect. We are also electrical impulses and goo.
[4:20:18] <elementofloyalty> AHH THAT SCARED ME
[4:20:22] <+HanPaul> every time Pat turns on the break music, I'm always hoping he plays "Crazy Talk" by Chilliwak
[4:21:03] <StubYourToe> @SGrim Basically bags of water with electricity
[4:21:07] <$RubberFistFight> @SGrim - isn't it great that everything you are, and everything you ever will be, is defined by a sack of pink goo with the rough consistency of medium tofu?
[4:21:08] <ToneBacas> Pat is putting Paige to bed real good
[4:21:12] <elementofloyalty> Did Pat ever Plank the toilet to piss?
[4:21:24] <Eijiken> I fall asleep to pat streams, and this wakes me up everytime in the middle of the night, but then i fall back asleep because this song makes me feel sexy
[4:21:34] <$RubberFistFight> Said sacks of pink goo are currently communicating across the globe with one another.
[4:21:39] <$SGrim> @StubYourToe more like bags of jello.
[4:22:01] <StubYourToe> @sgrim a more apt description, sir
[4:22:04] <$SGrim> @RubberFistFight yes. I have also held the entirety of another person's being in my hands. Medical classes are fun.
[4:22:34] <$RubberFistFight> @SGrim - I've held a human heart in my hands before. It's kind of a humbling experience.
[4:22:35] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> This intellectual conversation going on in the chat, and all I get out of it is the sudden urge for jello Kappa
[4:22:36] <+valkuma> Who here is a shepshifter
[4:22:36] <elementofloyalty> When is Paige covering this tune?
[4:22:58] <$SGrim> @RubberFistFight holding a brain is less profound. It feels icky. WutFace
[4:23:01] <%SmolBluGhost> God this is one of the most relaxing songs
[4:23:08] <Eijiken> smooth pass on peach covering this
[4:23:14] <fairore> @amaniisyourboss do it
[4:23:16] <StubYourToe> whats the name of the song
[4:23:17] <$RubberFistFight> @SGrim - yeah i can imagine it would. Was it preserved or fresh?
[4:23:19] <@thenefftw> So how about them video games
[4:23:24] <elementofloyalty> Pat can sing it.
[4:23:27] <%MisterCrimson> @RubberFistFight if you didn't chant "Kali-Mah" while holding it, you're a failure
[4:23:34] <$RubberFistFight> well... "fresh", i mean after death it doesn't keep for longer than like 6 minutes, so...
[4:23:37] <%Jpdodds> @thenefftw I like video games
[4:23:39] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Always played this song during my breaks at work
[4:23:54] <Eijiken> @StubYourToe Beneath the mask
[4:23:56] <$Bonkasaurusrex> This song with no vocals is calming as hell.

[4:24:20] <$SGrim> @RubberFistFight fresh. Cadaver was from the day before. Best comparison I've got for normal situations was that it felt like a mass of wet food you sometimes touch while washing dishes. DansGame
[4:24:20] <Hispanacomida25> I like the rain variant when I need that extra calm

[4:35:39] <ragasquid> is stream over?
[4:35:41] <captainthunderwolf> @GarbageQueenEllie To a limited degree, I think. Like, "Lol butt stuff" is only funny because it's got some mild shock value, so saying it over and over reduces the effect.
[4:35:41] <pectusumbra> OoOoOoOo~ The BABY

[4:36:58] <%xemnahort> remember yesterday when pat said he wouldn't stream any more of this game
[4:37:02] <+RevolverOcelot16> We don't need more game, we need more Elmo.
[4:37:06] <Darren716> roada_rolla_da You trust pat to cook?
[4:37:09] <captainthunderwolf> Svef is cocaine but hallucinogenic, if I remember correctly.

[4:38:17] <captainthunderwolf> Hey, could someone tell me why this rando NPC quest giver has a better portrait than Pallegina, returning character and main party member?
[4:38:18] <%AbnormalVoid> Gellarde
[4:38:20] <captainthunderwolf> Just curious.
[4:38:23] <+RevolverOcelot16> Aww come back, Elmo. Stream is messed up now.
[4:38:25] <dreu81> Who is she Cathy? With all these acks
[4:38:25] <%Jpdodds> Elmo is a Watcher
[4:38:42] <%Remery_> Bag of Pies? sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[4:38:42] <$Bonkasaurusrex> This seems like a massive improvement over the first game.
[4:38:42] <elementofloyalty> vailiant?
[4:38:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf I guess someone on the team doesn't like her
[4:39:06] <wolfofsound> LOUD NOISES
[4:39:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf It's because all the returning party members have portraits in the style of wanted posters.
[4:39:13] <elementofloyalty> @peachsaliva how often has Pat gone to Gym?
[4:39:22] <captainthunderwolf> @elementofloyalty Vailia, it's basically Spain/Italy but inhabited by black people. They speak a bunch of pesudo-Spanish and Italian and a liiittle pseudo-French.
[4:39:30] <$RubberFistFight> @elementofloyalty - pat trains at the gym of cheese and toilet paper rolls.
[4:39:37] <rosemon5001> but there isno mc in the sewers
[4:39:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf I'm all for replacing the new portraits with rips from the first game, in all honesty.
[4:39:40] <elementofloyalty> :O :D
[4:39:40] <@thenefftw> I wonder where Pallegina went off to
[4:39:46] <%xemnahort> is paige reall there I don't see her it could be a recording
[4:40:00] <%Jpdodds> COVERED IN SHIT
[4:40:01] <elementofloyalty> SWIMING IN PEE N TURDS
[4:40:13] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie See, that's neat, but that doesn't really justify giving an important character blatantly worse art, you know? But I'm with you, rips would actually have been the way, had I done it.
[4:40:14] <StubYourToe> oh man
[4:40:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wade through the shit water.
[4:40:20] <TheImmortal70> Not just people, YOU failed
[4:40:22] <TheImmortal70> Super hard
[4:40:26] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Ew
[4:40:29] <elementofloyalty> Im gonna puke

[4:40:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> ewewewewewewewewewwww
[4:40:31] <+RevolverOcelot16> Eww
[4:40:34] <captainthunderwolf> Man, Pat's gotta climb through two miles of shit to get out of Vailia.
[4:40:34] <elementofloyalty> BANNED
[4:40:35] <HypeArbalest> Eww just eww
[4:40:35] <$RubberFistFight> Oh hey I'm wading through shit-filled misery in Dark Souls right now too.
[4:40:37] <Bouldus> greeeaat
[4:40:38] <%xemnahort> noice
[4:40:39] <+KoyaMusa> pat is covered in poo right now
[4:40:41] <dreu81> Ewwwwwwww
[4:40:43] <%Mistheart101> Yeah and your character's pretty good at dealing with illness too-- Wait no your body's gotten fucked up in the past this joke doesn't work.
[4:40:43] <Eijiken> blighttown?
[4:40:46] <Strideral> Gotta get out some how...lol
[4:40:47] <$Bonkasaurusrex> A shit covered dwarf just climbed out of a toilet.
[4:40:48] <+Meiou> pat is now shit dwarf
[4:40:51] <$RubberFistFight> Poop keeps attacking me with spikes, it's weird. What the fuck do these people even eat?
[4:40:51] <+MrBinkley> Pat living that toilet dream
[4:40:53] <elementofloyalty> un fuckable
[4:40:54] <+doodads> survival horror progress
[4:41:00] <$spacehouse> dog came too
[4:41:01] <mr_slaide> WE DEMAND ELMO!
[4:41:14] <Kenori> WHERE IS OUR CAT SON
[4:41:16] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Spikes I think
[4:41:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Just another day in the life of Patron the great.
[4:41:19] <rosemon5001> being once covered in a cow shit thrown at me i can confirm it sucks
[4:41:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> This is the kind of antics I expect from Pat
[4:41:24] <elementofloyalty> GIMME ME BACK MY ELMO
[4:41:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> This shit dwarf isn't a tresspasser.
[4:41:52] <%xemnahort> wouldn't someone notice the trail of sewage they have to be leaving
[4:41:53] <elementofloyalty> covered in wretch
[4:41:56] <%Mistheart101> Even though you're covered in shit.
[4:42:01] <+RevolverOcelot16> This stream needs more Elmo now! sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[4:42:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[4:42:08] <StubYourToe> there are poo tracks everywhere now
[4:42:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Try bathing in the fountain
[4:42:11] <elementofloyalty> My name is Luca
[4:42:22] <+doodads> excuse me this is a Christian stream
[4:42:30] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie Maybe I'm a Traditionalist, but I believe that if someone enters a home by climbing through the sewers and out through the toilet, instead of through the front door, they now own that house over everyone who has entered in a less interesting way.
[4:42:31] <$RubberFistFight> I don't wanna turn 35 in 3 days this is fuckin bullshit :'(
[4:42:47] <StubYourToe> @RubberFistFight fuck getting old
[4:42:50] <elementofloyalty> FINGERS?
[4:42:53] <%Mistheart101> FINGERING
[4:42:55] <Bouldus> still younger then Paige Kappa
[4:42:55] <captainthunderwolf> The fin-gers.
[4:43:03] <elementofloyalty> Paige is a baby
[4:43:05] <$RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - what, for real?
[4:43:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf They have already established themselves as the alpha male at least.
[4:43:11] <elementofloyalty> Pats Old
[4:43:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Great Pat now you have to go back through the toilet.
[4:43:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Please find somewhere to bathe. This is unseemly!
[4:43:22] <$RubberFistFight> Pat is 3 years younger than me i think
[4:43:23] <StubYourToe> great job guards
[4:43:28] <+doodads> Paige is 43
[4:43:28] <+KoyaMusa> they left because you smell
[4:43:29] <$RubberFistFight> he was born in '86, yeah?
[4:43:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> And coming from ME, that's saying something!
[4:43:38] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat it was the middle of the night. That's why thy were closed.
[4:43:42] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie If a man covered in shit tries to fight you, you're contractually obliged to engage him if you were born with testicles. That's just something a man knows.
[4:43:44] <Fattonie89> Guards left because you smell like poo
[4:43:46] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight i dont actually know, i heard them say they are like 30 iirc, but i dont really believe it
[4:43:49] <elementofloyalty> Paige KIlled Pats daughter and replaced her.
[4:43:50] <Iam_Dead> @captainthunderwolf it's a powermove
[4:43:56] <roada_rolla_da> @rubberfistfight I think he turned 34 recently
[4:44:01] <$RubberFistFight> @doodads - I don't think that's true but I don't know enough about Paiges to dispute it.
[4:44:03] <wolfofsound> climbed through shit for nothing?
[4:44:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> You climbed through the sewers for no reason.
[4:44:18] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I wanna say Paige is 30.

[4:44:57] <$RubberFistFight> POLO?
[4:45:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> You idiot.
[4:45:21] <Bouldus> @captainthunderwolf i believe shes 2 years younger then pat iirc
[4:45:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> I CAN NO SPAKEN ENGRISH
[4:45:23] <iwasJase> he's too naive
[4:45:25] <captainthunderwolf> This guy really needs an accent to sell his "I'm a confused outsider" shit, IMO.
[4:45:36] <elementofloyalty> Does Tawenu have leprosy?
[4:45:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Agreed.
[4:45:44] <captainthunderwolf> Like this game is great, and some of the accents are great, but some characters need either better or different accents.
[4:45:50] <ArcticAsylum> So he's just a dumbass from a dumbass people
[4:45:57] <$Chimeraelite> technically he has an accent. Everyone else has some twang
[4:45:57] <prismaticsnake> the 'skyrim' thing
[4:46:01] <$RubberFistFight> Time to look at the 2BFP wiki for Pat's age
[4:46:08] <SchroedingersFerret> It's really weird listening to an NPC speak without an accent he's clearly supposed to have.
[4:46:10] <elementofloyalty> uh oh
[4:46:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Too many of these voice actors are just doing generic accents.
[4:46:14] <Strideral> Need to waste time? Dive in a sewer!
[4:46:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dasss Racissss
[4:46:36] <$RubberFistFight> Pat is 32 - his bday is April and he was born in 1986, according to the wiki.
[4:46:36] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight it was his birthday for the ff tactics stream so he migth say it in the first bit of that
[4:46:40] <iwasJase> 2
[4:46:46] <%AbnormalVoid> Ac Ac Ac Ac
[4:46:47] <roada_rolla_da> @rubberfistfight Pat was 14 when FFT came out, FFT came out 20 years ago, therefore he is 34
[4:46:47] <elementofloyalty> PAT THAT 8 BIT IS CUTE
[4:46:59] <$RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - oh you mean the stream where he LET IT SET IN
[4:47:02] <yalwin_khales> @AngriestPat Ever consider doing an Oblivion stream? Maybe just a one-off?
[4:47:06] <captainthunderwolf> @Chimeraelite True enough, but to an American-English speaking audience, pretty much anything without a lilt sounds like no accent. Y'know what I mean?
[4:47:08] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight yea :D
[4:47:20] <$Chimeraelite> true, true
[4:47:24] <$RubberFistFight> @roada_rolla_da - the wiki lists his birth year as 1986. It's impossible for him to be 34 this year because it's not 2020 yet.
[4:47:25] <captainthunderwolf> Right, so Paige is 136 years old.
[4:47:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is some old fashioned native exploitation right here.
[4:47:35] <elementofloyalty> 136 years...young
[4:47:53] <roada_rolla_da> @rubberfistfight well, it was Pat that said it
[4:47:54] <Meme_Platinum> kill him
[4:48:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> WOW now that's a bribe!
[4:48:25] <%rdark_ksu> he super bribed you dude
[4:48:27] <captainthunderwolf> See, and "per complancanet".
[4:48:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Blackmail is for winners!
[4:48:35] <$RubberFistFight> @roada_rolla_da - yeah and he more than likely just gave a vague age or remembered it wrong. He's remembering something from nearly 2 decades ago. Protip: human memory sucks and becomes less accurate as more time passes between events.
[4:48:38] <elementofloyalty> THRUST THRUST THRUST
[4:48:39] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> 136 is pedophilia for an immortal wizard. 136 is a zeroth percent of infinity.
[4:48:43] <captainthunderwolf> That'd be more like, "per complanCAN-et".
[4:49:06] <roada_rolla_da> @rubberfistfight You perfectly described Pat there
[4:49:29] <+Wrekts> Luca is a drunk and was at the bar go talk to him there
[4:49:31] <%Mistheart101> This is uncomfortably racist, holy shit. Good job, writers, seriously.
[4:49:34] <%rdark_ksu> why not just bread his arms
[4:49:38] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie Oh man, this is some REAL OLD-FASHIONED native exploitation. You were super right.
[4:49:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> These guys are REALLY just the East India Trading Company.
[4:49:44] <elementofloyalty> daylight?
[4:49:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> KILL HIM
[4:49:57] <TehBrickz> MURDER
[4:49:59] <Wistelligence> daylight, pat
[4:50:01] <+Superstarsage> Gonna have to steal the contract
[4:50:01] <elementofloyalty> KEEL HEEM
[4:50:03] <Spydurman> murder
[4:50:07] <%ziriken> Blow him up and destroy paperwork
[4:50:08] <captainthunderwolf> Killing him won't kill the COMPANY, Paige.
[4:50:10] <startstoprepeat> can you steal the forged contract from him and swap the two around?
[4:50:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf You got the British and the Italians fighting eachother through exploited natives and money. Super classic.
[4:50:12] <Graxe_> Time for violence.
[4:50:12] <Wistelligence> he specifically mentioned daylight, come back at night
[4:50:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> CASTRATE HIS BALLS AND SELL THEM TO A KROGAN
[4:50:15] <$RubberFistFight> @Mistheart101 - lol, you want uncomfortably racist, did you hear the latest news about Detroit Become Human? The song the androids are singing in the E3 trailer is A SLAVE SONG.
[4:50:16] <DraxTD> murder everyone, Paige said so @AngriestPat
[4:50:21] <KTDelgado> steal the paper work
[4:50:40] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Mnm, Paige still hasn't lost her Genocide boner I see. Kappa
[4:50:44] <%PrincessLuna85> he has dried wine on his shirt why not just get him drunk and get him to change it?
[4:50:48] <AlasterAngelo> all sharkfuckers are scumbags
[4:50:53] <elementofloyalty> YELL
[4:50:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> MORE BRIBES?!
[4:50:56] <TheImmortal70> MR> SHAKE DOWN.
[4:51:02] <%rdark_ksu> this guy has more $$$ than sense
[4:51:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> BRIBE HARDER
[4:51:07] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Oh man, THIS GAME'S GONNA BE GREAT.
[4:51:09] <Ser_Randal> STOP GIVING US MONEY GIVE CONTRACT
[4:51:14] <%Mistheart101> @RubberFistFight Well that's more David Cage not understanding how to be a good person in anything ever.
[4:51:15] <$RubberFistFight> @PrincessLuna85 - isn't dried wine just like... grape juice? All the alcohol would evaporate way before the water.
[4:51:29] <elementofloyalty> Pat you did something
[4:51:31] <wolfofsound> medieval pockets
[4:51:37] <iwasJase> GELLARDE
[4:51:37] <+GreenJudgement> @AngriestPat This dynamic camera is awesome
[4:51:44] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat If threatening people isn't moral, how come you're making so much money doing it? I think the game is trying to tell you something.
[4:51:45] <sparrrow_> patron the bribe queen
[4:51:45] <%PrincessLuna85> i mean it signals him as being a drunkard so you can probably get him drunk and do whatever you wanted in his office
[4:51:48] <elementofloyalty> DIARREA
[4:51:50] <%PrincessLuna85> @RubberFistFight
[4:51:50] <%rdark_ksu> nachos are fucking rad any time any where
[4:51:53] <Iam_Dead> Big bribes
[4:52:00] <Ser_Randal> GELLARDE
[4:52:07] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I would kill for some nachos
[4:52:10] <DraxTD> no chat
[4:52:10] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat I think you could've done something with the fake contract
[4:52:10] <elementofloyalty> GELLARDE?
[4:52:13] <$RubberFistFight> @Mistheart101 - I actually talked about it a bunch on my stream yesterday but the problem is that he's got way too many ideas, and no editor or someone to get him to narrow his focus down. He also lacks subtlety. If his ideas got filtered through someone else they could actually be decent.
[4:52:26] <Bouldus> looool
[4:52:26] <HypeArbalest> HAHAHAHAHA! The reality is much worse for you.
[4:52:32] <$RubberFistFight> But he doesn't know how to handle tricky subjects delicately so he just comes at them like a bull at a gate.
[4:52:37] <Bouldus> you smell like bantha poo doo Kappa
[4:52:54] <elementofloyalty> yoink
[4:52:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> weeeee sparkly thibgs
[4:53:00] <TheImmortal70> Nah man, we shook them down

[4:53:03] <iwasJase> 4
[4:53:04] <%Mistheart101> DON'T DO A POCKETS
[4:53:05] <captainthunderwolf> Okay, a LOT of these fake Vailian words are being delivered completely without accent and it's fucking me up. I know I'm way stuck on this, but it just gets me.
[4:53:08] <muerphy> Hey Pat
[4:53:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Emeralds and a pearl, good shit.
[4:53:21] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I just scrolled back up, did someone say Detroit has a slave song in it??? DansGame
[4:53:28] <pectusumbra> yes
[4:53:30] <elementofloyalty> Kalei - you smell like ass
[4:53:30] <TheImmortal70> "hello, I am side character. Gellardee
[4:53:38] <$RubberFistFight> @Mistheart101 - it's a similar problem to what George Lucas has. David Cage basically needs an Irvin Kirshner type to temper his crazy.
[4:53:44] <Bouldus> @wolfofsound "incoherent Jawa noises"
[4:53:50] <iwasJase> he's short
[4:53:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> What's your point ho?
[4:53:57] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man, David Cage is so smart and creative for using robots as an allegory for slavery.
[4:54:03] <captainthunderwolf> No one's done that.
[4:54:04] <elementofloyalty> ORGY
[4:54:08] <wolfofsound> @Bouldus In some cultures we'd be married now
[4:54:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> The british are trying to headhunt you.
[4:54:18] <Ser_Randal> PLAY BOTH FACTIONS
[4:54:19] <captainthunderwolf> It's not like, literally, "I, Robot" touched on that.
[4:54:20] <TheImmortal70> Awww yeah, we got hired.
[4:54:27] <mr_slaide> STEAL FROM EVERYONE.
[4:54:28] <%Fenrirlives> HEADHUNTING!
[4:54:32] <roada_rolla_da> When is Detroit coming out, again?
[4:54:39] <elementofloyalty> Meeces
[4:54:40] <Strideral> YEYEYE DOG GANG
[4:54:41] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - I'm not saying that. Just that what he makes could be significantly better if it was run through someone that could focus it better and cut out the indelicacy a bit.
[4:54:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> You need to find a bath for your posse, dude
[4:54:53] <wolfofsound> HYPE
[4:54:55] <Bouldus> @wolfofsound lol that almost made me cry :D
[4:54:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Almost every android story ever touched on that.
[4:55:02] <elementofloyalty> TAKE THE RING
[4:55:07] <+Meiou> free booze!
[4:55:08] <muerphy> Is this game about sharting yourself at disneyland? Becas my cousin could relate
[4:55:09] <%Jpdodds> DOGS OhMyDog
[4:55:11] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - he's an ideas man, not a writer.
[4:55:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> The playable demo is now available for download.
[4:55:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> For Detroit.
[4:55:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie But Kaje added SO MUCH to it!
[4:55:22] <wolfofsound> @Bouldus the crying comes when we consummate
[4:55:23] <Strideral> Steal it all!
[4:55:35] <elementofloyalty> meow
[4:55:40] <mr_slaide> Dah baby. :(
[4:55:54] <startadevy> Watson
[4:55:58] <elementofloyalty> cous
[4:56:00] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I do appreciate you being so reasonable about him, but writing Sci-Fi involves being an idea man by default. It's one of those genres where a lack of individual ideas will leave you beached every time.
[4:56:02] <Bouldus> @wolfofsound oh god
[4:56:21] <elementofloyalty> What a butter face
[4:56:24] <sparrrow_> there are much better places to shart
[4:56:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> PAT, you need to wash the poop stuff off your crew, or you might get EBOLA!
[4:56:36] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie (Just so we're clear, chief, because Twitch doesn't convey tone - you recognize that I was being sarcastic and are also dumping on Cage, aye?)
[4:56:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf (I do)
[4:56:57] <elementofloyalty> @GarbageQueenEllie the dry stains hold their clothes together.
[4:57:00] <BronyOfTheFence> I don’t know...There’s an awful lot of side quests in these games. Sharting yourself at Disneyland seems reasonable.
[4:57:03] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie (Neat-o, friend)
[4:57:07] <ArcticAsylum> Tone on the internet...lol
[4:57:18] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man, Arctic, it's a problem.
[4:57:40] <%centrilion> I smell embezzlement...
[4:57:42] <ArcticAsylum> An unsolvable one at that
[4:57:47] <elementofloyalty> GET OUT OF PAT DEMONS
[4:57:49] <StubYourToe> you're sooooo good looking
[4:58:00] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - don't get me wrong, I still think his games are hilariously bad and he enjoys the smell of his own farts a bit too much, but I can still acknowledge that there's a few nuggets of brilliance scattered throughout the shit he produces.
[4:58:04] <DraxTD> what's embezzlement smell like @centrilion
[4:58:07] <DraxTD> ?*
[4:58:25] <%centrilion> Shame, fear and shame
[4:58:30] <captainthunderwolf> @DraxTD Have you ever smelled a 50-year old business man who cheats on his wife? Like that, kinda.
[4:58:31] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat go work for royal deadfire company and put a net loss into the books
[4:58:46] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - and what you said about being a sci-fi writer is absolutely true - but that's why they usually have editors that help them narrow their scope a bit.
[4:58:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> ^*GUN GANG* has now been switched to *EBOLA GANG*^
[4:58:53] <elementofloyalty> NO YAWNING
[4:59:04] <Bouldus> ebola gang shit?
[4:59:13] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - the aroma you've just described, my imagining of it would be "old spice and shame"
[4:59:18] <DraxTD> @captainthunderwolf unfortunetly I've only smelled 50 year old buisnmen who are either single or never cheated, in both cases loyal
[4:59:19] <TheImmortal70> You know I just realized that everyone knows about your ghost bullshit, and have done NOTHING about it
[4:59:28] <PippinItUp> Is this Detroit: Become Human?
[4:59:33] <ArcticAsylum> The trick to everything is to stop caring at all then you'll be free. It's amazing.
[4:59:39] <sparrrow_> shart so hard
[4:59:45] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:48] <Strideral> YEYEY DOG GANG
[4:59:50] <StreaminDemons> Wait, did they make a custom portrait for @AngriestPat with this early access copy? Or, is that just in the base game.
[4:59:51] <mr_slaide> Toby the wonder dog.
[4:59:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Toby!
[4:59:53] <elementofloyalty> USED CAR Toby?
[4:59:54] <ArcticAsylum> Become as George Carlin
[4:59:58] <%Jpdodds> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[5:00:00] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I think my genuine issue with Cage is that he's so fucking proud of his genuinely mediocre at best work. As a writer, it's incredibly frustrating for me to see this guy jerk himself off to "bUt I wROTe a gHOST stoRY abOUT gAy PeoplE aND NavajO".
[5:00:03] <aslfrasle> Drink your water Pat!
[5:00:13] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> ...there's a bot for staying hydrated?
[5:00:15] <StubYourToe> I sense an Elmo nearing
[5:00:16] <%MisterCrimson> Toby fills you with DETERMINATION
[5:00:27] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight And that's probably the correct smell, man.
[5:00:27] <%Mistheart101> well im gonna go to bed gnight folks
[5:00:30] <%SaltyDongs> Littlest toby
[5:00:31] <elementofloyalty> NIte
[5:00:47] <StubYourToe> nite
[5:00:50] <ArcticAsylum> @captainthunderwolf You don't like getting that hot native dick for no reason?
[5:00:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pleasant Dreams
[5:00:54] <mr_slaide> Has he found Elmo yet?
[5:00:58] <Bouldus> wooot hooker bonus
[5:00:59] <StubYourToe> nope
[5:00:59] <elementofloyalty> EWW
[5:01:02] <aeravon> Question for Paige: Have you ever tried Bertman's Original stadium mustard?
[5:01:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> It probably lasts for 2 rests.
[5:01:07] <%AbnormalVoid> !hooker
[5:01:07] <%ziriken> nah, only toby fox
[5:01:07] <TheImmortal70> @angriestpat The poop seals the juices in
[5:01:11] <$spacehouse> the funk has laminated it
[5:01:13] <Bouldus> like the one Paige gets from her gross boots
[5:01:14] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - eh, it's good that he's got pride in his work, but yeah he's kinda oblivious to the fact that his works lands like a ton of bricks and everyone's laughing at it.
[5:01:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's how it worked for inn/hooker bonuses in 1.
[5:01:19] <muerphy> Are you sure? Becas this looks a whole lot like the incident in the hanted mansion
[5:01:20] <roada_rolla_da> “Prostitute bonus”, you mean an STD?
[5:01:30] <elementofloyalty> She wants to see his horse size cock
[5:01:37] <$RubberFistFight> In a way that's envious though, he's totally unawares of just how janky and terrible his plots are and he legit thinks he's a genius.
[5:01:39] <deviljhojho94> he just said his dick is huge
[5:01:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> This looks like a job for THE EBOLA GANG
[5:01:51] <captainthunderwolf> @ArcticAsylum I'm cool with that Native dick Might+Perception bonus, but I'm really mad about Jodie wanting to bang Ryan DESPITE BEING AN ABUSIVE 30-YEAR OLD WHO TOOK HER FROM HER HOME.
[5:01:54] <ArcticAsylum> Conan?
[5:01:55] <Bouldus> the only type of barbarian
[5:02:06] <ToneBacas> did that guy just yell "DLC!"? DansGame
[5:02:12] <TheImmortal70> It's almost like they're BRINE imps
[5:02:21] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> The Ryan "romance" could not make less sense.
[5:02:22] <%MisterCrimson> Because there were no pickjle barrels for them to come out of
[5:02:23] <mr_slaide> Guvnor!
[5:02:24] <%SaltyDongs> Ahhhhhhh look out up there buddy there's a monster
[5:02:34] <iwasJase> ELO GUVNOR PIP PIP
[5:02:35] <Bouldus> its almost like the town guard are shit and dont do their job Kappa
[5:02:36] <mr_slaide> Hoi, Guv'nor!
[5:02:41] <elementofloyalty> Cheereeoh GUVERNOIR
[5:02:45] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - one scene I think Cage nailed was the one where ryan and jodie are about to bang and the trauma of her past comes back up and makes her vag just dry out in seconds, and she starts crying.
[5:02:53] <ArcticAsylum> @captainthunderwolf He literally was like an abusive step father with sexual perversion like ten years before he should be
[5:03:07] <elementofloyalty> Guverness
[5:03:11] <%SaltyDongs> Ello love
[5:03:22] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Yeah, but then Ryan just LEAVES LIKE A FUCKING CUNT.
[5:03:30] <ArcticAsylum> Remember he wanted to bang, Jodie had a breakdown and he was like "No puss? IM OUTTA HERE!"
[5:03:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight And Ryan just bounces. Like wtf that's priceless
[5:03:54] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight @RubberFistFight Basically. And, like, look - not an SJW, leftist certainly, but I'm not emotional as a rule - but the way he exploits women in his games makes me fucking mad, dude. I just generally hate using chicks as rape bait and sex candy. That scene's decent, but it comes back to using rape as drama bait.
[5:04:00] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - Like, that is a legit reaction to trauma, and it's good that he addressed that instead of just having it not be important to her character. And Ryan bouncing drives home how much of a cuntwaffle he is.
[5:04:01] <elementofloyalty> Dog piddles on her Carpet.
[5:04:14] <$RubberFistFight> Which is what makes the ending that much more retarded and ridiculous.
[5:04:19] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Oh man, fuck Ryan.
[5:04:19] <+Meiou> pocahontas what? :p
[5:04:28] <deviljhojho94> I fucking love it when americans try to pronounce foreign words like that
[5:04:30] <deviljhojho94> It's endearing
[5:04:35] <ArcticAsylum> Fuck Ryan, but don't FUCK Ryan
[5:04:42] <captainthunderwolf> Too long-a delayed-a
[5:04:46] <bonefried> did they get more voice acted lines in this
[5:04:46] <captainthunderwolf> For the ad-ra
[5:04:52] <elementofloyalty> Pat get a Tissue
[5:04:53] <captainthunderwolf> Gott-a get-a the ad-ra
[5:04:57] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - yeah I'm not a fan of the "rape as drama" trope either, it's tacky and distasteful. That particular subject should be treated respectfully and not be used for cheap shock value or "character building".
[5:04:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ryan needs to get taught a lesson by the Ebola Gang
[5:05:01] <captainthunderwolf> (These jokes are okay, I'm Italian)
[5:05:02] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I can't help but wonder if David Cage wrote a love interest character for Jodie, forgot about him, made Ryan a love interest, remembered the previous love interest, then said "fuck it, zes are ze endings to ze good game".
[5:05:05] <dreu81> Too longa delayedah
[5:05:07] <deviljhojho94> What a quirky little language english is
[5:05:19] <MarylandJutsu> Yo stream chat, has Pat found the Elmo in game yet?
[5:05:25] <elementofloyalty> nah
[5:05:26] <Strideral> Nope not yet
[5:05:28] <iwasJase> nah
[5:05:33] <Vylontitan> N o
[5:05:34] <elementofloyalty> DIN DIN
[5:05:36] <MarylandJutsu> one day we shall find the good boi
[5:05:41] <ArcticAsylum> English is a bunch of bullshit with made up rules that hafl the time it doesnt even folloe...like what
[5:05:44] <MarylandJutsu> and then the game will be the besstttt
[5:05:53] <elementofloyalty> now we get food eating porn
[5:05:55] <deviljhojho94> I actually had a couple of Italian courses back at Uni, so a lot of the Ocean folk words do seem familiar
[5:05:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Where have you been?
[5:05:56] <roada_rolla_da> SourPls
[5:05:59] <ArcticAsylum> My grammar on Mobile is astounding
[5:05:59] <StreaminDemons> I hope this becomes an eating ASMR stream.
[5:06:06] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Y'know Rubber, y'might be terrified of aging and all, but you genuinely seem like a fairly mature and well-reasoned guy. A lot of people who would have your fear and child-man shutins with no life experience.
[5:06:07] <deviljhojho94> Specially how they pronounce the C
[5:06:12] <MarylandJutsu> Elmo, now is your chance TAKE OVER TE STREAM
[5:06:13] <elementofloyalty> Si
[5:06:19] <deviljhojho94> Ci
[5:06:26] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Basically, yeah, you're 35. But at least you seem to think like an actual grown-up.
[5:06:45] <captainthunderwolf> *are child-man shutins, not and
[5:07:01] <elementofloyalty> delivery guy is a fan and gets autograph as tip
[5:07:16] <MarylandJutsu> no he gets ELMOS autograph
[5:07:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> ^And it's always better to be at peace with yourself and your age, rather than the alternative
[5:07:20] <deviljhojho94> a tip from pat's 12 kilos cock
[5:07:21] <MarylandJutsu> much more valuable
[5:07:24] <ArcticAsylum> I'm 21, think like a 60 year old drunk, depressed poet, and feel like an 80 year old with bad bones
[5:07:31] <roada_rolla_da> They should invite the delivery man in and play a few rounds of Third Strike with him
[5:07:44] <deviljhojho94> seduce the delivery man to get bonus stats
[5:07:45] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - oh I'm a complete manchild, don't get me wrong :P It's possible to be both of those things, they're not exclusive XD
[5:07:50] <Bouldus> @ArcticAsylum it only gets worse :D
[5:07:51] <elementofloyalty> PLEASE LET DELIVERY BE A CURVY SEXY WOMAN
[5:08:00] <Warbot40> God I wanna play p5 again...
[5:08:01] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Hey, you could be 25 with fuck all for life experience, so you're doing good.
[5:08:06] <MarylandJutsu> @elementofloyalty but then paige will kill her on principle
[5:08:08] <deviljhojho94> A male delivery man provides bonus to DEX and pat may use that!
[5:08:08] <ArcticAsylum> @bouldus GREAT
[5:08:15] <elementofloyalty> its a good thing
[5:08:26] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - but I do like to think I'm at least reasonably well-adjusted.
[5:08:48] <elementofloyalty> Paige eats virgin flesh to stay young LOOKING.
[5:08:59] <Bouldus> @ArcticAsylum welcome to being a grumpy old man
[5:09:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> ^I thought that's what her mom did
[5:09:08] <elementofloyalty> HI PAIGES MOM
[5:09:12] <+razielhex> By the time I was 25 I was already on my third middle east deployment. So there's that.
[5:09:12] <$RubberFistFight> @elementofloyalty - Paige = Elizabeth Bathory confirmed?
[5:09:13] <deviljhojho94> I always thought paige ate virgins for the laughs
[5:09:13] <Bouldus> HI MOM
[5:09:18] <captainthunderwolf> I'm an undetermined age, think like a philosopher, and hate politics.
[5:09:18] <ArcticAsylum> @bouldus I was born a grumpy old man
[5:09:25] <Bouldus> same
[5:09:26] <$spacehouse> Im a chaff chartreuse?
[5:09:29] <captainthunderwolf> So what we can take from this is that I've got an inflated sense of self-worth.
[5:09:36] <ancrest_tant> @elementofloyalty I always thought she sucked the life force of pregnant woman
[5:09:52] <deviljhojho94> She just kills pregnant women for entertainment. Common mistake
[5:09:53] <MarylandJutsu> @ancrest_tant and their unborn child
[5:09:53] <elementofloyalty> Sorry about your sons bald head Mrs. Boivin
[5:09:56] <Strideral> No she'll such the life source from the baby
[5:10:03] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - what's funny is leftists think I'm right, rightists think I'm left, and neither of them seem to regard "I'm Australian, your political spectrum doesn't apply like you think it does to me" as a valid answer.
[5:10:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope Peach got nachos so that she can grossly crunch them over the mic
[5:10:05] <ArcticAsylum> So, anyone wanna share some drugs?
[5:10:11] <ToneBacas> @RubberFistFight if you're not into cheap shock value, you should have seen some shit anime that was running on twitchpresents yesterday. 10 minutes in the first episode the main character was established as a suicidal bully victim who was about to get raped. yes, this was on twitchpresents. it also baffling just how unsubtle that intro was
[5:10:15] <MarylandJutsu> @GarbageQueenEllie BIG CRONCH
[5:10:16] <elementofloyalty> POPPERS
[5:10:23] <deviljhojho94> lov that crunch
[5:10:30] <ArcticAsylum> Pot, preferably. I could use getting spaced
[5:10:48] <Kenori> Cronch time?
[5:10:50] <ArcticAsylum> sorry, DANK KUSH as the kids say
[5:10:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige's Mustardo's. It's got the crunch with PUNCH
[5:10:55] <Bouldus> @ArcticAsylum youll be let down then, doesnt to a lot
[5:10:57] <elementofloyalty> HEY
[5:11:03] <lankaster88> Ayye
[5:11:04] <elementofloyalty> TACOS AND NACHOS
[5:11:06] <deviljhojho94> is that the cronch
[5:11:06] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I dig that. I'm a Socialist with a business degree, a queer best friend, and a strong attachment to the idea that there's a limited set of genders. It's just that, for me, there's like 10 as opposed to infinity. Which pisses off other Socialists a bit, see.
[5:11:10] <elementofloyalty> STFU PAIGE
[5:11:11] <$RubberFistFight> @ToneBacas - a good example of two works of fiction I checked out of because of that kind of shit is Game of Thrones, and Preacher. The latter introduced a ridiculous "molested by the school mascot" subplot for a character that didn't need it and it literally did nothing to build the character at all.
[5:11:13] <yougei> cilantro PogChamp
[5:11:14] <Kenori> I hope they got a bunch of banana that they can eat without peeling them
[5:11:15] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Looking at this be right back screen reminds me of how much work I gotta do as a budding artist.
[5:11:16] <deviljhojho94> Nachos are barely mexican anyways
[5:11:16] <lankaster88> Its cilantro!!
[5:11:16] <%rdark_ksu> corriander takes like soap to you eh?
[5:11:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> AAAAAH NACHOS
[5:11:19] <Captain_Joe1911> PogChamp
[5:11:23] <Captain_Joe1911> atpChar

[5:11:36] <iwasJase> i think you mean cilantro?
[5:11:37] <Strideral> Coriander? lol
[5:11:38] <Wistelligence> Coriander or cilantro?
[5:11:39] <%ziriken> Theyre chips
[5:11:40] <Bouldus> @ArcticAsylum maybe ive been at it to long
[5:11:41] <elementofloyalty> YEA EAT THAT YOU SEXY BEAST
[5:11:44] <mr_slaide> Pat, you always seems to always be eating garbage.
[5:11:45] <$spacehouse> fried corn
[5:11:45] <DraxTD> American Mexican food = tortia meat and cheese XD
[5:11:48] <$RubberFistFight> IT'S CORIANDER DAMNIT
[5:11:48] <iwasJase> coriander does not taste like soap, it's cilantro
[5:11:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> CILANTRO IS A SYNONYM FOR CORRIANDER
[5:11:49] <captainthunderwolf> @rdark_ksu Could try having better genes.
[5:11:51] <$RubberFistFight> AND IT TASTES LIKE SOAP
[5:11:52] <+tuesti> cilantro is amazing
[5:11:53] <+timblenaut> i think they're the same thing, coriander = cilantro
[5:11:54] <BestTeaMaker> they're the same thing
[5:11:55] <deviljhojho94> It's always a flour tortilla too
[5:11:56] <+Nilbop> Koriand'r, you say?
[5:11:58] <elementofloyalty> STREAM IS SO HAWT
[5:12:03] <lankaster88> Kappa
[5:12:07] <deviljhojho94> CILANTRO TASTES AMAZING FUCK OFF MAN
[5:12:07] <Meme_Platinum> cilantro is delicious
[5:12:08] <ArcticAsylum> @bouldus It's been a while for me, you build a tolerance and get sick of it. Just like anything else
[5:12:10] <ancrest_tant> They're the same thing I thought
[5:12:11] <%ziriken> (check twitter Pat/Paige)
[5:12:12] <%rdark_ksu> @captainthunderwolf true but respecing this late in the game would be unwise
[5:12:13] <Tearonex> no please pat?
[5:12:15] <sylphyyyy> That's okay pat, cilantro doesn't taste like soap to me but I still don't likw the taste.
[5:12:16] <+tuesti> i love the paige narration
[5:12:16] <TheWarpedPixel> Coriander/cilantro is the worst. I have the same gene as pat.
[5:12:16] <+ymorn> i was wondering what mexican food yall had with coriander
[5:12:18] <elementofloyalty> HEY THERE'S NO WRONG TACO
[5:12:21] <$sleepy_coffee> oh yeah Paige don't like the Chickens
[5:12:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> At least it's not a fish taco
[5:12:22] <+tuesti> Paige is the Narrator of the stream
[5:12:24] <%Remery_> Shrimp Taco?
[5:12:28] <ChocoboTheMoogle> Some people have taste buds that make cilantro taste like soap
[5:12:30] <iwasJase> fish taco
[5:12:32] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[5:12:32] <elementofloyalty> Paige is a FOOD DIVA
[5:12:35] <ChocoboTheMoogle> Its s stupid thing
[5:12:39] <captainthunderwolf> @rdark_ksu True true, you don't get skill points back.
[5:12:40] <Bouldus> @ArcticAsylum and sometimes that tolerance doesnt die if you stop for a bit :P
[5:12:44] <$RubberFistFight> coriander is fine in very small amounts alongside other herbs, it can add a nice flavour. But more than a tiny amount just makes everything taste like you're chewing on a bar of cheap soap.

[5:13:20] <iwasJase> waow
[5:13:24] <ToneBacas> @RubberFistFight yeah that sort of character "building" is such a cheap move. I get that we're supposed to feel bad about a character, but is literally nothing else other than *that* which could have happened to them instead? That's the sort of stuff we'd expect from such subtle writers as David Cage
[5:13:27] <elementofloyalty> CHEW INTO THE MIC pAT

[5:14:21] <Iam_Dead> Some people are genetically predisposed to think cilantro smells and tastes like soap
[5:14:21] <+Nilbop> This is it. This is the world Idiocracy warned us about.
[5:14:21] <$RubberFistFight> @ToneBacas - oh man it gets so bad in Game of Thrones in the later seasons. Like, they write a character into a corner and have nothing to do with them but the episode is a focus on them, so they're like "I know, we'll get someone else to rape them! That's compelling storytelling, right?"
[5:14:22] <elementofloyalty> COOKING IS GEY

I've never played a sport, but I've had legs like tree trunks ever since middle school. They're good for kicking doors and stuff real hard.

[5:26:38] <aslfrasle> DO IT YOU WIMP
[5:26:48] <deviljhojho94> The ebola makes them grow stronger
[5:27:03] <antthefool> It yearns to become one
[5:27:07] <ArcticAsylum> @captainthunderwolf Kick boxing is always an option, but yeah i dont work out that much but id say im pretty actice so i just always look fit and healthy. And I'm a ok with that
[5:27:09] <antthefool> That sounds sick
[5:27:09] <captainthunderwolf> HER NAME IS MARIHI, SHE PRONOUNCED IT MA HI RI
[5:27:10] <elementofloyalty> DISGUSTING
[5:27:13] <captainthunderwolf> THIS GAME IS TRASH NOW
[5:27:16] <Strideral> That's a sick name for a sword

[5:27:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Thus is the might of the Ebola Gang
[5:27:47] <+Superstarsage> WHOOPH
[5:27:54] <ArcticAsylum> Eat the ebola to become stronger
[5:27:57] <ancrest_tant> I would love it warriors were just walking advertisements when fighting
[5:27:59] <antthefool> Salivates
[5:28:00] <deviljhojho94> Infect yourself with ebola for less time on the clock, but extra atack power!
[5:28:03] <Ser_Randal> Its straight up a zweihander
[5:28:13] <%Arxel1> And you can enchant this shit??
[5:28:15] <blastazoid26> BIG NUMBER
[5:28:17] <captainthunderwolf> @ArcticAsylum Here's my rationale for advising people to learn to fight, like a proper martial art: When would you ever look back at your life and NOT have wanted to learn kick-boxing?
[5:28:29] <mr_slaide> Zweihander means Japanese sword.
[5:28:43] <captainthunderwolf> Zweihander is German for "katana".
[5:29:15] <elementofloyalty> Doe she sell a Concertina ir Herdy Gerdy?
[5:29:19] <StubYourToe> katana is German for Zweihander
[5:29:28] <ArcticAsylum> @captainthunderwolf That's good reasoning. Your legs are at least twice as strong as your arms. Why would you not always use them? The answer? Kick boxing
[5:29:37] <GoldeNOVA> Zweihander is German for reading the mind of the opponent
[5:29:54] <ArcticAsylum> Remember kids, if you get in a fight. Just non stop RoundHouse
[5:29:55] <captainthunderwolf> Katana is a Japanese term meaning, "Anime was a mistake."
[5:30:06] <$spacehouse> shillelagh is nordic for tasergun
[5:30:07] <elementofloyalty> Meet me at the gey bathhouse?
[5:30:09] <Everpresent_Overseer> Shiv is Mexican for sneaky short sword
[5:30:21] <elementofloyalty> NUDE BANNED STREAM
[5:30:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> OH GOD FINALLY. They're going to bathe
[5:30:25] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - problem with martial arts is they don't teach you how to fight dirty, so if you're ever in a serious fight you might be at a disadvantage unless you're like Bruce Lee-level
[5:30:25] <mr_slaide> Look at that exuberant bullshit.
[5:30:28] <+TheShal> Editor's note: Zweihander is german for German Sword
[5:30:31] <%commanderclaw> Are those tiddies?
[5:30:40] <$RubberFistFight> i know that from personal experience too, so...
[5:30:40] <StubYourToe> Cthulhu bath
[5:30:40] <elementofloyalty> cock n balls
[5:30:42] <captainthunderwolf> I gotta shower, dogs, so I'll be back in 20ish if he's still streaming.
[5:30:48] <ArcticAsylum> Oops all tiddies
[5:30:53] <Strideral> Creep on the tiddles
[5:30:53] <blastazoid26> Slay them all and bathe in their blood
[5:30:59] <%ziriken> Zweihander is English for お前はもう死んでいる
[5:31:07] <+Nomicro4u> When you where partying,I studied THE BLADE
[5:31:21] <$RubberFistFight> @ziriken - <note: keikaku means plan>
[5:31:25] <%rdark_ksu> pat it is rude to turn down a discount
[5:31:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> BLAST YOU EBOLA GAAAAANG
[5:31:28] <elementofloyalty> BREASTICLES
[5:31:28] <NeroInfinite> Why do they add adra to everything?
[5:31:31] <+Nomicro4u> When you were having premarital sex. I mastered THE BLOCKCHAIN
[5:31:32] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Hahaha, I've got busted nerves that give me an unhealthy pain tolerance and a hormonal problem that makes me associate pain and anger with joy. I don't have to worry about not learning to fight unfair. You ARE completely on-point though, and I agree.
[5:31:33] <%Jpdodds> Undyne?
[5:31:37] <ArcticAsylum> OI
[5:31:44] <ArcticAsylum> OI M8
[5:31:45] <NeroInfinite> Is it like cocaine?
[5:31:45] <Meme_Platinum> Udyne
[5:31:47] <StubYourToe> shes only 1 letter short
[5:31:48] <ToneBacas> Undyne sure has an accent
[5:31:48] <elementofloyalty> FUCKEWD?
[5:31:55] <blastazoid26> You just turned down FREE MONEY, Pat.
[5:31:56] <ToneBacas> Paige should be reading these
[5:32:01] <%titans_ace_jerid> Is it bad I understand her totally?
[5:32:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @NeroInfinite To make money off the gullible.
[5:32:05] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Knowing how to take a punch, headbutt a fucker, and punch the ribs is a lot more effective for the average person.
[5:32:06] <elementofloyalty> trouth
[5:32:10] <Meme_Platinum> gaelic stuff
[5:32:14] <ArcticAsylum> She's sounds like the opposite of education
[5:32:16] <iwasJase> trouth
[5:32:17] <NeroInfinite> So it's just like crack.
[5:32:18] <ToneBacas> thank god these are voiced
[5:32:28] <elementofloyalty> racist
[5:32:30] <%commanderclaw> If elves live longer why don't they just run everything
[5:32:33] <captainthunderwolf> For the record, chat: You headbutt by aiming for the other person's nose, not their forehead.
[5:32:37] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - yup. You know how gorillas and chimps win fights? They go for the eyes, the throat and the genitals.
[5:32:44] <Strideral> The Doggo is drowing
[5:32:50] <$RubberFistFight> That's how you should fight if you're in a situation where your life is at risk.
[5:32:50] <GoldeNOVA> Is that Eyepatch Wolf?
[5:32:59] <StubYourToe> you could kill someone doing that
[5:32:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf That makes the Krogan headbutt in ME2 make so much more sense
[5:33:02] <iwasJase> CABBITCH
[5:33:03] <+Nomicro4u> Yeah but in order to get into a fight you'd have to leave the house
[5:33:06] <iwasJase> ya bitch
[5:33:11] <GoldeNOVA> Next she's gonna say "Fillem"
[5:33:11] <$RubberFistFight> @StubYourToe - if they're trying to kill you, why does it matter?
[5:33:13] <elementofloyalty> A Water Nymph?
[5:33:18] <%Jpdodds> Now this is Scottosh
[5:33:21] <%Jpdodds> Scottish
[5:33:23] <thallasonthickshield> woo sounds like great grandma blackwell. i miss that unintelligible old hag
[5:33:29] <King___Crimson> What alien language is this woman speaking?
[5:33:35] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Remember, all it takes to end a fight is a solid tap on the Adam's apple. Don't do it too hard, though, because that WILL kill someone if they collapse their throat.
[5:33:36] <iwasJase> scottish
[5:33:41] <elementofloyalty> SKIP
[5:33:44] <ArcticAsylum> In a fight to the death, anything goes. Going through motions will get you killed
[5:33:44] <+seycheles> pillars of paternity
[5:33:48] <deviljhojho94> what the fuck is this language
[5:33:54] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - yeah a crushed trachea is no fun.
[5:33:58] <deviljhojho94> some kind of barbarian speech?
[5:33:58] <iwasJase> fermer
[5:34:04] <captainthunderwolf> @GarbageQueenEllie Exactly. You tapped him on the snout.
[5:34:07] <deviljhojho94> oh god my head hurts
[5:34:18] <elementofloyalty> EYE FOCED YA
[5:34:20] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - anyway you were going to shower and stuff weren't you? I'm off myself, gotta start my dark souls stream and slog through miles of shit-filled foulness for hours.
[5:34:22] <VectMachine> Seems like Aloth would be useful here.
[5:34:23] <$RubberFistFight> later folks
[5:34:24] <StubYourToe> i can get that but self defense laws, and also, avoiding killing someone is better for everyone
[5:34:25] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah but dogs, Imma shower, so see y'all in a few
[5:34:27] <elementofloyalty> see ya
[5:34:35] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Aye. Have a good night, fam.

[5:39:35] <elementofloyalty> Find the massuse
[5:39:35] <ArcticAsylum> @sirrice77 Watch enough good fighting and play it through your head. When the time comes, hopefully it doesn't. You'll have a plan and execute it.
