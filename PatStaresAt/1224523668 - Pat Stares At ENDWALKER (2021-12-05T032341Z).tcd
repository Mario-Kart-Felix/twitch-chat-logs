[0:24:41] <%GallowsDrop> Oh.
[0:24:56] <@QueequegTheater> Oh. I see.
[0:25:02] <+tetraes> well guess we found our first trial
[0:25:02] <toyforus235> what?
[0:25:04] <wolverinewaswrong> YOOOO FFX
[0:25:04] <%JoshManVGH> Cause they used his body, I guess
[0:25:04] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Nemesis?
[0:25:06] <%Aarn_And_Off> ANIMA ANIMA ANIMA
[0:25:07] <%kid_flashionable> Ooh
[0:25:07] <ape_hawk> SEYMOUR?
[0:25:07] <Acegoodyear> yoooooooooo
[0:25:10] <gespenst25> The Jung and the Restless.
[0:25:11] <%StephanieSadGirl> Nemesis?!~
[0:25:12] <+athuramn> oh it's anima
[0:25:12] <%baka_sugoi> WutFace
[0:25:15] <+NeonLight> Shinryu evolved?
[0:25:17] <SaltyAzteca> this is god?
[0:25:18] <reonome> oh its literally anima lmao
[0:25:19] <%Shadowthedigger> Cause it's Parent and Child just like Seymour and his mom.
[0:25:19] <+ahdurian> Anima D:
[0:25:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SICK
[0:25:24] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:25:24] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> Yo Anima!
[0:25:26] <+diegobandzz> @QueequegTheater pat asking for the physical guide for me but you are not wrong
[0:25:26] <youngin_______420> coolest
[0:25:29] <rmwolfe> oh cuz he's a crazy murder man's parent
[0:25:33] <+LimitlessPsycho> What is the timeline in XIV? This is happened in like a couple years
[0:25:33] <dan_g_v> PMSeymour?!
[0:25:36] <%EynoStiles> you guys suck
[0:25:38] <@QueequegTheater> Like, they're desecrating his fucking corpse.  He might have been a cunt, but nobody deserves that.
[0:25:38] <+BlubRobe> One guy can influence the summoning I guess. Like how instead of Rhalgr you got Shinryuu
[0:25:56] <Blank9> anima is too cool a design
[0:25:59] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Because Varis became a summon much like how Seymour's mother became Anima or like how Jecht became the Final Aeon
[0:26:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh my god
[0:26:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh my god oh my god oh my god
[0:26:11] <Vermillion129> that's sick bruh
[0:26:13] <Blank9> it  should  be a mainstay more than most
[0:26:15] <%Solareon_> we were inside Varis. hot
[0:26:15] <+athuramn> ff14 and ffx are the same universe
[0:26:15] <%GallowsDrop> I never even realize that I'm so dumb
[0:26:16] <+NeonLight> "if they drop decent loot"
[0:26:17] <%VHGS> that's nasty

[0:26:19] <SeaReally> combatsexual
[0:26:22] <%UvBenServed> If they drop good shit, sure
[0:26:27] <livi242> farm parties
[0:26:27] <%whyskeywolfe> butcherreeeeeee
[0:26:32] <monster_craft23> Is the free trial version of ff14 worth playing or is it too restricted?
[0:26:34] <%kid_flashionable> aroboCursed that is not the best afterlife to have, good lord
[0:26:35] <@QueequegTheater> It's so far beyond disrespect for the dead
[0:26:37] <17sevens> gotta get glam tho
[0:26:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bitch i will kill the same guy 99 times if i need to
[0:26:40] <%InternetShis> Yeah they shoved Varis's body parts into the tower to suck up aether to make Anima into a primal that would control the remianing masses
[0:26:48] <%InternetShis> That seems to be the whole puzzle
[0:26:49] <SeaReally> yes its super worth playing the free trial
[0:26:58] <+BlubRobe> He's worried you don't think he's cool anymore...
[0:27:01] <sirrice77> @monster_craft23 you get to play the base game and it's first expansion which is good. It's worth playing
[0:27:03] <%Reilata> Man is horny horny, can't stop.
[0:27:06] <Acegoodyear> He wants you back bro
[0:27:06] <%UvBenServed> He's like Evil Naruto
[0:27:06] <@QueequegTheater> @monster_craft23 free trial players will not be able to play for the next week, but it's the whole base game and first expac, minus some social features
[0:27:12] <SaltyAzteca> HE SAID REUNION
[0:27:14] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Cait Sith wine?
[0:27:14] <+diegobandzz> so its animancy?
[0:27:18] <%InternetShis> No but he wants your sword penis
[0:27:23] <%EynoStiles> he is trying to impress his crush
[0:27:24] <+tetraes> trailer line
[0:27:25] <GeltonZ> Just don't get tricked into paying for the free trial! Two of my friends did and there's no going back from it.
[0:27:27] <Vermillion129> get the fuck out of my friend list

[0:36:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> pat is uniquely suited to dealing with this shit
[0:36:49] <sirrice77> So you're saying you've trained all your life for this moment?

[0:52:39] <%StephanieSadGirl> I thought that was Julia Lepetit from Drawfee for a second
[0:52:40] <%Aarn_And_Off> I think they're trying to use Anima to summon Zodiark

[0:55:56] <azure_dunes> zenos pisses your pants for you
[0:55:56] <%NopeBadguy> ZENOS ALMOST MADE YOU PEE YOURSELF
[0:55:57] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Paige also asked you for a thing
[0:55:58] <+starlorb3> tbh i forgot completely about the crystal gathering
[0:56:02] <%luftraumm1> doesnt every shard have a computer?
[0:56:03] <%PayCreeps_> what if zenos pissed your pants
[0:56:05] <televisedrevolting> Now you can piss yourself in your own body.
[0:56:08] <@QueequegTheater> HE PISSED YOUR PANTS
[0:56:09] <%UvBenServed> I can't believe Zenos made Pat piss on stream
[0:56:16] <+LimitlessPsycho> The best part, Zenos could have literally said nothing and nobody would have noticed
[0:56:20] <Profmcstevie> Now the only one who shits the pants is YOU
[0:56:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat didnt bring a piss or shit bucket. Not a real gamer
[0:56:29] <+Pleblu> At least you know whos piss it is
[0:56:32] <%justcallmebobplease> Where we at since the kickover to Paige like three hours ago?
[0:56:38] <zenith0111> @starlorb3 Really? It was even a plot point in Shadowbringers tho

[0:57:47] <thecrazyestminer> @jorniev Because the wol doesn’t have vocal cords duh
[0:57:47] <+Havictos> That could have gone really bad
[0:57:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> that could have been alot worse
[0:57:59] <Zourath> "Zenos is telling people rats can swim!"
[0:58:06] <%X2Eliah> Well Pat *is* technically working for Amazon, he should have a piss bottle
[0:58:09] <%Aarn_And_Off> forgot his Endwalker brand diapers I guess
[0:58:14] <+LimitlessPsycho> Zenos went into your Mogstation and canceled your account
[0:58:38] <rReizs> talk to thancred
[0:58:39] <+Havictos> Not even close
[0:58:41] <RushUnplugged> Y'shtola would have got his ass because she sees the different aether, but he couldn't hide being a creep
[0:58:42] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Zenos used your Mogstation to buy a bunch of boosts
[0:58:44] <SeaReally> OOOO
[0:58:52] <Edible_Enthusiasm> gateway to the gods

[1:01:50] <+FinetiSonata> :)
[1:01:51] <RushUnplugged> you kill Zenos and then he's like "you fool I WAS HOLDING HIM BACK"
[1:01:56] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's not! It's an FF4 dungeon!

[1:02:13] <2Sam4Hall> Did we even bring white auracite? I don't think killing either of them would work without it
[1:02:19] <Blank9> so much ff4  references
[1:02:36] <SamHellbent> Put me in coach
[1:02:48] <+Edrem> Zenos unslotted your old removed abilities from hotbar you kept for sentimental value
[1:02:51] <jubejube56> Nah we will learn that the radios happen to use technology that doubles as white auracite
[1:02:54] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt For reference, the Tower of Babel in FF4 is what Golbez used to summon the Giant of Babel from the moon.
[1:02:55] <jorniev> WHAT kind of filthy shit did ZENO do to your account!?

[1:12:08] <Zebroneath> jam incoming
[1:12:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat's not even a streamer, he's just talking to a computer in an empty house - it's all leftover money from the game pirating days.

[1:12:41] <arkv01> damn this train is COOL
[1:12:43] <+natjen8> @Shockrates20XX the population of the game has doubled in the last 6 months. This is to be expected
[1:12:46] <%luftraumm1> c'mon xaelaaa
[1:12:54] <$realm_forge> Pat are you ok?
[1:12:58] <%NopeBadguy> He was probably doing Fates
[1:13:01] <%whyskeywolfe> While you were courting chat, he honed the blade.
[1:13:08] <djblue_shift> is it just me or does smt v's third area fucking suck\
[1:13:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt roulettes are VERY powerful now, and I think Bozja exp got buffed
[1:13:10] <Saltmeisterr> who's the job trainer for reaper?
[1:13:20] <rReizs> honestly bloodwhetting is bonkers
[1:13:26] <+darrylwestly> Is pat playing with Winnie the Pooh
[1:13:28] <+GalaxyUni> Is pat alright? Why is he talking to himself?
[1:13:29] <+LimitlessPsycho> Pat we’ve organized this intervention because we’re worried about you.
[1:13:33] <%lucky_icarus> I still do them anway!
[1:13:33] <+the22cstomp> @Saltmeisterr a really badass old lady
[1:13:35] <%BlackStarAura> Get fucked, spider things
[1:13:43] <%NopeBadguy> Bedwetting
[1:13:44] <+Kyma1020> It's new bloodbath
[1:13:46] <+FinetiSonata> I AM the healer now
[1:13:47] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr cool
[1:13:49] <%lucky_icarus> Id rather die than not wall 2 wall!
[1:13:53] <SinisterBroccoli> reminds me of drk old aoe heal
[1:13:53] <%RocketBarrel> DRK fuckin sucks in self preservation now...
[1:13:59] <+donpatrondx> the PLD heal on the shield thing is great too
[1:14:06] <%Dakuu75> Samurai don't have Merciful eyes anymore. now we just have second wind ;_;
[1:14:08] <%AquilaHarukaze> Every 25 seconds, you cycle regular cooldowns between them and you're practically invincible.
[1:14:14] <rReizs> WAR was already "you don't need to heal me" in ShB and its even better now
[1:14:38] <%Aarn_And_Off> The Champion of Eorzea doesn't free captives
[1:14:39] <+TuskDeluxe> nin just keeps getting more aoes I have so many
[1:14:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> holy sheltron is probably the best button PLD has now
[1:14:45] <%X2Eliah> Edge Knight
[1:14:53] <%JohnAtDawn> Reaper is COLORFUL
[1:15:18] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Reaper is a poetics tombstone
[1:15:21] <%NopeBadguy> DO IT
[1:15:24] <%NopeBadguy> MAKE THEIR DAY
[1:15:40] <+LimitlessPsycho> Zenos chose reaper just so he could keep your attention
[1:15:42] <%YakumoYomi> Gief hates onscreen VFX clutter
[1:15:45] <%X2Eliah> No but Healers adjust
[1:16:08] <%UvBenServed> LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:10] <%AquilaHarukaze> The insanity of WAR's self-healing makes holmgang on dungeon pulls a very real and very busted thing
[1:16:11] <%Aarn_And_Off> god I love how FF4 this dungeon is
[1:16:22] <%RealThiele> the renown Barnabus
[1:16:24] <%luftraumm1> ff4 sound off!!!
[1:16:28] <rReizs> he smacked the handler
[1:16:43] <%kyh9> WAIT
[1:17:02] <%Aarn_And_Off> Magnets how do they work
[1:17:12] <%kyh9> So they're going to combined Zeromus + FF2 Emperor as the final boss?
[1:17:14] <%kid_flashionable> oh it's Barnabas!
[1:17:14] <+Local16> I love the reaper shield so much
[1:17:27] <%NopeBadguy> Use equilibrium for a big chunk of healing like after you take a huge TB or eat a mechanic @PatStaresAt
[1:17:39] <%NopeBadguy> You're not gonna see a lot of use for it in dungeons
[1:17:43] <%NopeBadguy> Unless you mass pull
[1:17:53] <MsYakumo> Barnabas dun got an axe in his head.
[1:18:06] <ape_hawk> fred flintstone voice: BAR-NEY!
[1:18:39] <%NopeBadguy> USHANKA
[1:18:41] <%NopeBadguy> HOLY SHIT
[1:18:41] <%Aarn_And_Off> The music so far has been amazing I'm excited once they start trying to beat us over the head with the emotional music like they did in Shadowbringers
[1:18:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[1:18:43] <+SkreamnRedSkull> Cheer1000 Push all the buttons Pat!
[1:18:45] <+NeonLight> maximum comf

[1:19:00] <%X2Eliah> Ok so its confirmed, the empire is just ruskies
[1:19:05] <%lucky_icarus> This is where you get the garlean coat you want Pat
[1:19:12] <+SodiumPatrol> lytJIVE this music slaps
[1:19:16] <TioXyco> oh damn, it his banger!
[1:19:32] <%NopeBadguy> It's a big war
[1:19:51] <PhazeShift> did pat beat the story yet?
[1:20:02] <MsYakumo> No
[1:20:05] <RushUnplugged> @PhazeShift no
[1:20:06] <+whens_starcraft> the Xaela contingent actually all lose to a stack marker, and Lyse has to run out of your fight to go phoenix down them, lmao
[1:20:07] <rReizs> no this is the level 83 dungeon
[1:20:08] <MsYakumo> He's mid-story right now.
[1:20:09] <%RealThiele> pat beat like 15% of the story
[1:20:09] <primarch_lupercal> no where close
[1:20:10] <+whens_starcraft> in the solo duty
[1:20:15] <+natjen8> this is the power of 64 bit
[1:20:20] <+Shockrates20XX> There's a specific marker for tankbusters now, that's a nice change.
[1:20:36] <livi242> that's been there for a bit I think
[1:20:42] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt When do you get your big Ungaa Bunga Spinning smash?
[1:20:45] <%NopeBadguy> Lanky Reap
[1:20:49] <PhazeShift> damn he's not skipping enough cutscenes then
[1:20:50] <librettodude> The fact it's called Tower of Babil makes me real nervous for if/when it falls
[1:20:53] <@QueequegTheater> It's very Araki
[1:20:58] <PhazeShift> already have seen people almost at max level
[1:21:03] <+FinetiSonata> smn is actually bonkers now
[1:21:11] <Ids560> Summoner seems fun
[1:21:11] <wolverinewaswrong> @librettodude your UI automatically turns to a random language
[1:21:12] <RushUnplugged> imagine being a loser that skips cutscenes
[1:21:12] <rReizs> summoner is sick you akh morn deathflare to start
[1:21:19] <+Vampireinarm> DRK Sadge
[1:21:27] <%Aarn_And_Off> there was someone who said they beat the story in 20 hours and I'm calling bullshit at this point theres so much happening lol
[1:21:34] <primarch_lupercal> i mean pats not exactly someone thats rushing to endgame
[1:21:41] <%Retinolgaming> Naruto power overload
[1:21:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[1:21:53] <wolverinewaswrong> looks like Alien
[1:21:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Aarn_And_Off they mustve been mashing through everything holy shit
[1:22:00] <+TuskDeluxe> Nin mains eating well
[1:22:05] <%JoshManVGH> When your decor can start to be described as "Centipede Chic," you've gone too evil...
[1:22:05] <RushUnplugged> *skips everything*-"game has no content"
[1:22:06] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt In FF4, the Tower of Babel was similarly high-tech
[1:22:06] <Ids560> don't like the centipedes
[1:22:12] <+the22cstomp> @Aarn_And_Off they probably skipped all the cutscenes like a cretin
[1:22:16] <librettodude> Centipedes? In MY Garlean Tower??
[1:22:33] <%Aarn_And_Off> yeah cause I'm just past pat here and I'm at like ...10 hours or so? like nonsense
[1:22:41] <%Aarn_And_Off> He fell off the moon??
[1:22:48] <+ahdurian> Dr Lugae?
[1:22:48] <wolverinewaswrong> he's the scientist from the other fight
[1:22:52] <%JohnAtDawn> *SIGHS IN EXASPERATED DRK*
[1:22:53] <%Retinolgaming> Which one? psaSmug
[1:22:54] <+NeonLight> Its the doc from before
[1:22:55] <%JoshManVGH> Face looks like Jet Jaguar.
[1:22:56] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is he missing an arm
[1:22:58] <ape_hawk> dont worry, pat, im sure in the next 6 years, dark knight will be better
[1:22:59] <2Sam4Hall> The DRK situation is so strange. They had to know right?
[1:23:00] <%NopeBadguy> He's the scientist that escaped earlier, the name matches
[1:23:01] <wolverinewaswrong> the one that got punched
[1:23:03] <+LimitlessPsycho> Zenos’ plan was actually to trap Pat in [Super Fly]
[1:23:10] <+TuskDeluxe> I'm like 25 hours in and barely over halfway ( I think)
[1:23:11] <+Vampireinarm> I dropped DRK as soon as i saw the patch notes
[1:23:13] <%Birdigalore> another FF4 boss
[1:23:20] <SaltyAzteca> yo i remember Lugae
[1:23:21] <+Shockrates20XX> Oh was he the nerd in the cutscene at or near the end of ShB?
[1:23:22] <bringmethemenu> I legit saw a warrior solo the last boss in a dungeon from 20% health. Warrior finished with full hp too, was crazy.
[1:23:31] <%UvBenServed> MECHANICS
[1:23:35] <%luftraumm1> a boss that comes right after barnabas
[1:23:36] <%NopeBadguy> smol
[1:23:54] <lemon_lover28> you are a little frog guy
[1:24:01] <rReizs> gnb has fairly good healing, combo heals, we get a ghetto excog, and 2 HoT charges
[1:24:05] <%Retinolgaming> So are DRK and Scholar the weirdos of this update?
[1:24:20] <+LimitlessPsycho> Beyblades can’t beat the smol boi
[1:24:32] <%Faustgesicht> reaper portal
[1:24:34] <%GallowsDrop> the two genders: Small and Toad
[1:24:45] <ape_hawk> frogs have gills, duh
[1:24:49] <+natjen8> @Retinolgaming I saw a top level scholar player saying they actually love lvl 90 scholar. So in reality, only time will tell with the first raids as to how viable stuff will be
[1:24:58] <+Shockrates20XX> They get oxygen from the water through their skin, and I forget what the word for that is.
[1:25:13] <%X2Eliah> @Shockrates20XX witchcraft
[1:25:13] <+Ricky_Nuggets> Do you guys remember when FF was good, before FF7 ruined everything?
[1:25:20] <SeaReally> frogs r cute
[1:25:21] <Zourath> Frogs, being the natural opposite of rats, treat all existence as underwater.
[1:25:30] <Saltmeisterr> @Ricky_Nuggets wut
[1:25:31] <psilent_p> cant you breathe underwater
[1:25:31] <%Faustgesicht> @Shockrates20XX breathing
[1:25:32] <+SodiumPatrol> bomberman bombs
[1:25:33] <%InternetShis> Mad because small. Jealous of frog.
[1:25:33] <ape_hawk> a rad dude
[1:25:35] <artoflec> frogs ARE cute 🐸
[1:25:36] <%MidnightBurst12> some dude?
[1:25:38] <%UvBenServed> Science man
[1:25:38] <+Havictos> Yeah Scholar didn't really get new toys but they're even more solid than they've ever been
[1:25:39] <Saltmeisterr> is this a bait
[1:25:43] <%Birdigalore> FF4 boss that they just threw in lol
[1:25:45] <%BlueLunecy> That was the scientist from the previous boss
[1:25:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt Lugae and Barnabas were bosses from FF4
[1:25:56] <$EsotericOdyssey> there's a lot of FF4 in this expac
[1:26:06] <MsYakumo> @PatStaresAt He was the scientist the big guy punched in the previous fight. Play FF4 for a bit more context.
[1:26:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Saltmeisterr He's super just trying to bait people.
[1:26:12] <%Nekros4442> Got my healer coat first try
[1:26:14] <+NeonLight> wheeeeeee
[1:26:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> fast elevator

[1:26:30] <+NeonLight> sup anima
[1:26:32] <2Sam4Hall> I haven't seen the role quests in EW at all, do you have to go out of your way to find them?
[1:26:36] <$SGrim> Daemonculaba!?
[1:26:37] <Edible_Enthusiasm> its not a trial either?
[1:26:37] <%Retinolgaming> @natjen8 Yeah but, hear me out, drone strike healing. psaSmug
[1:26:45] <artoflec> damn this area looks cool af
[1:26:50] <librettodude> oh that's not horrifying at all
[1:26:54] <+Vampireinarm> just finished this, Anima is just anime in name and apperance, the fight hardly uses any of its actual moves
[1:26:56] <ape_hawk> when do we get to the moon?
[1:26:58] <+natjen8> @Retinolgaming LUL
[1:27:09] <%THATGUY_789> steel womb ball run

[1:27:27] <RushUnplugged> yeah maybe don't spoil shit
[1:27:29] <rReizs> chad WAR use equilibrium to snap aggro stragglers
[1:27:30] <%GallowsDrop> I honestly expected Varis' primal form to be the Emperor from FF2 but I guess they'll save the FF2 references for the Raid series
[1:27:41] <artoflec> there was an incredibly gieger looking room in the CG trailer
[1:28:20] <artoflec> look at these ultralisks
[1:28:20] <ape_hawk> remember gang: geiger is pronounced geeg-er

[1:45:01] <Airuzen> @17sevens Yoshi-P said in an interview that we'd say "wait already" at around level 83 in Endwalker, and I think he meant the moon.
[1:45:09] <karl_rex> We're Warriors on the Moon we sing our Warrior tune. But there ain't no whales so we tell tall tales and sing our Warrior tune
[1:45:23] <Zourath> @LimitlessPsycho Weren't you paying attention? He got turned into a frog at one point, now he doesn't need to breathe. That's how that works.

[2:01:45] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:51] <wolverinewaswrong> Shit I don't even know what happened before this
[2:02:02] <engineboi> I feel like shouting SPOILERS when nobody spoiled should be a bankable offense.
[2:02:19] <BurritoArcade> I don't even know what's going on lol
[2:02:20] <%X2Eliah> Moon's haunted, then sexy dog. Big spilz.

[2:02:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @optimasmaximas I've only seen people saying the first trial is soon, but that's pretty much always at level x3, so I wouldn't think that's too surprising

[2:04:27] <+Arxel1> that'd be wild LUL
[2:04:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I would lose my mind
[2:04:34] <VioletRosefall> I can't believe the expansion ends at level 83, crazy
[2:04:34] <%MonsterEnvy> Zodiark was built up as the final boss
[2:04:35] <+tetraes> if Zodiark is 83 then  wtf is the rest of this expac about?
[2:04:36] <%epide> so does any one else think that the reason that your pc is imune to tempering is becouse were temperd by hydalin

[2:04:54] <engineboi> No shot
[2:04:54] <+Vampireinarm> the final days havent even started
[2:04:54] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Where could the story possibly go
[2:04:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Plants on the moon.
[2:04:56] <@QueequegTheater> SINCE 1.0
[2:04:56] <+Akizea> GET THIS JOBBER OUTTA HERE
[2:05:00] <+BIumen> basically since we learned he existed
[2:05:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> zodiark is like, THE VERY FIRST primal isn't he?
[2:05:03] <TioXyco> moon pipes
[2:05:12] <+Arxel1> Zodiak? More like Jobbiark
[2:05:13] <azure_dunes> pretty moon theme
[2:05:15] <%Retinolgaming> BIG MOON
[2:05:17] <neraren> Long tradition in Final Fantasy of the obvious last boss not being the last boss
[2:05:17] <+theinfamousq> LoFi Beats to Cancel the Apocalypse To
[2:05:20] <jubejube56> Now the level 90 boss has to be a golden doodle
[2:05:22] <%X2Eliah> ohhh so you gotta do this for all 4 shattered swords
[2:05:25] <ratearth> Moon's haunted... by dogs
[2:05:26] <+Kyma1020> Makes you think where the Allagans got the Dallamud idea from
[2:05:28] <%JoshManVGH> If Zodiark is the 83 trial then... the source of the Noise is going to be a serious problem, huh?
[2:05:30] <%MonsterEnvy> @cobalt_phoenix_ I can't remember if it was him or Hyde
[2:05:34] <%king_wragles> So this is just the end of FF14 then? How are they going to do another story arc?
[2:05:41] <ArmadaGeddra> :) :) :) :) :)
[2:05:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i thought that said lingering gief lmao
[2:05:59] <%JoshManVGH> @king_wragles It's the end of this story arc, is how they put it.
[2:06:06] <iris_tepes> @king_wragles whole new story
[2:06:07] <%X2Eliah> @king_wragles hydaelin turns evil , maybe?
[2:06:08] <BlindGato> is this the FINAL fantasy?
[2:06:09] <karl_rex> If Zodiark with the strength of 75% of the Ancients population couldn't beat Hydaelyn who had significantly less he's a punk ass bitch
[2:06:09] <%X2Eliah> idk
[2:06:09] <%Maids4lyfe> @king_wragles yes they have 10 more years planned
[2:06:13] <Frostydough1> @king_wragles end of the warrior of light sequence, also they just opened up all of space so thats up for them
[2:06:14] <%epide> @king_wragles dude they have a 10 year plan
[2:06:15] <%Nekros4442> @king_wragles even if the Zodiark Hydaelyn arc is over there's plenty of loose ends
[2:06:19] <%UvBenServed> He said the thing
[2:06:21] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat problem is, if Zodiark is the ultimate bad, and you beat him; where does the game PISSIBLY go from there?
[2:06:24] <neraren> Looking forward to the FF14 Filler Arc to come
[2:06:25] <Zourath> @king_wragles If I had to guess, go to the old dragon planet.
[2:06:26] <+theinfamousq> daymn
[2:06:30] <BurritoArcade> The real final fantasy is the friends we made along the way
[2:06:33] <%croutonian> Swift as darkness, Cold as ash. those are lyrics from shadowbringers theme
[2:06:36] <%MonsterEnvy> The Void is a pretty big deal
[2:06:37] <Edible_Enthusiasm> the spinning light in the sky reminds me of a lighthouse

[2:46:49] <+FinetiSonata> I mean yeah, that was Zodiark's ONE job
[2:46:50] <+theinfamousq> Yoshi P got other things to do
[2:46:50] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Yay Endwalking! Had to work all weekend so avoiding stream until I catch up. Only fresh out of the first dungeon, but my prediction is we give Zenos the flower in the end.
[2:46:54] <%walternatorz> big problem.
[2:46:58] <%DashXero> That sounds pretty bad.
[2:47:00] <17sevens> if you did nothing else also wins by unleashing zodiark. it's lose/lose
[2:47:01] <Reaperzod> Killing Zodiark was a good idea
[2:47:02] <%walternatorz> maybe the dog can help
[2:47:03] <%DashXero> Is that bad?
[2:47:05] <arkv01> damn thats a good final boss death tho
[2:47:06] <majindusto> BIG OOPS
[2:47:06] <%CapnBeefs> Oh, that is not good
[2:47:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU! TL;N:"KEIKAKU" Means plan.
[2:47:22] <Airuzen> Zodiark was what stopped the final days, so when Zodiark is gone, the final days start
[2:47:27] <%walternatorz> theater kid gets his soliloquy
[2:47:28] <karl_rex> Is this really happening?
[2:47:28] <%X2Eliah> sploosh
[2:47:33] <Edible_Enthusiasm> didn't the final days just cause creation magic to go out on control? can people even use creation anymore
[2:47:33] <+tetraes> are they trying to make us feel bad for Fandango????
[2:47:35] <oniwahoo> "You fools, I was holding them back!"
[2:47:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So Fand wanted to die?
[2:47:44] <+Solutha> someone tell danial to shut it
[2:47:46] <+Arxel1> @Edible_Enthusiasm :)
[2:47:52] <karl_rex> He really gets this moment?
[2:47:56] <Ghufufin> fandango is a drama kid to a t
[2:47:57] <%Solareon_> i did it myyyyy wayyyy
[2:47:59] <+Arxel1> @oniwahoo I mean, literally, said multiple times in the story
[2:48:00] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles He's been telling us this for a while
[2:48:01] <arkv01> is he doing slam poetry as he dies?
[2:48:03] <neraren> I bet all magic is creation magic
[2:48:05] <DefaultSettiings> nice hat
[2:48:11] <penitentpendant> Took so many runs to get that hat
[2:48:12] <Srthunda> this wouldnt have happened if emet had just left that clown alone
[2:48:12] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> So looks like Pat's guess of "what could they do after killing Zodiark?" is going to come true
[2:48:13] <%TheAntiNihilist> I bet you're wondering how I got here? well my story starts millenia ago...
[2:48:15] <ape_hawk> makes sense
[2:48:15] <$Pompadourius> It's a good hat
[2:48:17] <+FinetiSonata> it's THAT good
[2:48:18] <%Maids4lyfe> LMAO
[2:48:19] <%furiousfurioso> Amon's mask was close enough to ascian this whole fucking time
[2:48:19] <+OneGorillionDollars> wait how does he have that, I HAVE THAT HAT NOW
[2:48:19] <+the22cstomp> the hat is his soulstone
[2:48:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @tetraes idk about "feel bad", but more explanation of why he hates everything
[2:48:20] <%NopeBadguy> Don't act like your hat isn't part of yours @PatStaresAt
[2:48:20] <%MonsterEnvy> So he always thought of himself as Amon over Fandanial
[2:48:21] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL Like your hat\
[2:48:21] <%Maids4lyfe> soul hat
[2:48:22] <%UvBenServed> As it should be
[2:48:22] <%alternative_flu> its the hat that makes the character Im assuming
[2:48:23] <%justcallmebobplease> I would pay $15 for the special ability in this scene to have your PC rush over and cold clock him mid-speech.
[2:48:25] <%BlueLunecy> It's a pretty good hat
[2:48:26] <%RealThiele> i believe it
[2:48:26] <%justcallmebobplease> Just shut up, Fandan
[2:48:27] <%shurtal> a hat like that? of course!
[2:48:28] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Isn't yours?
[2:48:30] <majindusto> The pimp hat
[2:48:33] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Same goes for your hat
[2:48:34] <%Shadowthedigger> I took your hat you bitch lord
[2:48:35] <Ids560> I'd want that hat to be a part of my soul
[2:48:39] <ape_hawk> wait, did amon just pull a Caius????
[2:48:44] <mehfromBL> I mean people can make their souls look like whatever they like if they know how
[2:48:45] <Airuzen> @QueequegTheater no his soul is bald
[2:49:01] <ape_hawk> omg, this plan is the same as the villain from FF13-3
[2:49:05] <$Pompadourius> I respect that even in Fandaniel's emotional moment, they're NOT running him back as sympathetic.
[2:49:09] <ape_hawk> 13-2*
[2:49:13] <kulmoth> "i was an asshole and i was right, fuck you, die" -funny daniel
[2:49:22] <mehfromBL> Yeah he pulling a Caius
[2:49:36] <jorniev> just fuck of and die by yourself
[2:49:39] <%JohnAtDawn> @kulmoth LUL
[2:49:42] <%RealThiele> DAMMIT ALLAG
[2:49:43] <MidnightPacif1c> tumbling down
[2:49:44] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt So is it just me or does Zodiark's face resemble Xande's
[2:49:45] <majindusto> XANDE?
[2:49:50] <DefaultSettiings> yeah but your mask looks stupid, so im not gonna agree with you
[2:49:53] <%walternatorz> Amon is the most compelling villain in the short duration his identify is revealed
[2:49:55] <oniwahoo> Why's this dude a fashion reject?
[2:49:55] <+theinfamousq> "Why Do Kids Love the Taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?"
[2:49:55] <%GallowsDrop> "Fuck yeah, I did it :)"
[2:49:58] <mehfromBL> Wonder if Xande reincarnated into anyone we know
[2:50:01] <karl_rex> Man Emet really fucked up turning Amon into an Ascian
[2:50:06] <+tetraes> Xande?
[2:50:07] <%MonsterEnvy> Amon was loyal to Xande I guess
[2:50:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> PAT LOOK
[2:50:17] <$EsotericOdyssey> DON'T PHONE RIGHT NOW
[2:50:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you... did it

[2:51:30] <MKII> I can believe tataru
[2:51:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hypothetically, parts of Zodiark should still exist on other shards
[2:51:36] <%ArticPath> OMG we could have Jenova...I never thought of that

[2:56:05] <majindusto> Good news: Moon Isn't  Haunted...Bad News:  Earth  is Now Haunted  lol
[2:56:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> This is literally just the plot of Doom
[2:56:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @penitentpendant Hydaelyn-possessed Lavos fights Jenova acting through replacement son Zenos, with the MC in the middle.
[2:56:13] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt So about what's happened so far its some crazy shit huh?
[2:56:14] <$Pompadourius> LMAO
[2:56:24] <%Dakuu75> Did pat fight Anima? (I think I dozed off for a bit)
[2:56:27] <+Arxel1> Can you imagine his outrage LUL
[2:56:31] <%kyh9> ZENOS FOR NEW SCION????
[2:56:32] <KnivesEve> bye pat
[2:56:34] <DefaultSettiings> how are you breathing anaise1Peek

[2:56:36] <+acridpaladin> just send him to the giratina dimension
[2:56:38] <MKII> botany was his calling
[2:56:39] <%kyh9> Would love to have Zenos as a scion
[2:56:41] <@QueequegTheater> @Dakuu75 Yes, Anima is just a dungeon boss
[2:56:42] <Zourath> If you think about it, if WoL just suggested a competition of who can kill the most end of days monsters, Zenos might've been helpful for at least a few quests.
[2:56:42] <%AHomeschoolDropout> how long have you been straming all together?
