[0:08:38] <Yrefe> oh right there's an Aria DLC
[0:08:38] <+Vork88> pat i send you a donation
[0:08:42] <dawarw0lf> It only left out something to die with a couple of missions yuh can do in the second act for later (it’s best for repays so you can get more time with certain characters)
[0:08:44] <%jackelzxaa> I do aria missions late because they overlevel you
[0:09:01] <adeblusopa> hi pat i send you my regards from europe
[0:09:03] <%LumberjackJack> Boooooooooooooo
[0:09:05] <Shockmaster182> Do you wipe after you shit?

[0:09:17] <dekkitout> Deng
[0:09:17] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a big oops
[0:09:24] <%chill_o_wisp> OOPS
[0:09:25] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat please tell me you got a guide to all the scannable thingys
[0:09:26] <%Dakuu75> So that guy got banned?
[0:09:42] <+Vork88> Hey pat I made you in sims 4 I had to use mods to change your height I say I got you perfectly down
[0:09:47] <%chill_o_wisp> lol
[0:09:47] <%jackelzxaa> I do javik early and do citadel’s first half after getting my whole party and the second half after meeting every me2 squaddie again
[0:09:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> Really? Did you use the mod manager to install it? It worked fine for me
[0:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> well, it's not like you need to 100% this one
[0:10:02] <Deasmeister> It's fine it's not like you need everything
[0:10:02] <%QueequegTheater> I do that all the time
[0:10:09] <dawarw0lf> Just ignore them until you have to do them. There not really important if you play how you usually do you’ll have plenty of war assets
[0:10:10] <+Alig200> weird, because I literally just bought the LE a day ago and installed a similar mod and it was fine for me.
[0:10:28] <JetpackMcQuack> but no reapers
[0:10:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Did you make sure to download the LE version?
[0:10:29] <mr_whalefarmer> getting a bit large big boy <3
[0:10:31] <%mike2hands> what about ur save file??
[0:10:38] <%jackelzxaa> Only one major mission is on a timer

[0:10:41] <ChungusQuest> yay chaos
[0:10:41] <dekkitout> Did the install instructions say to use an installer, do it manually, or nothing at all
[0:10:44] <%greasypete00> pee pee
[0:10:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Okay, sorry
[0:10:49] <%jackelzxaa> Theres a few “cutoffs” too but people can tell you which ones those are

[0:11:27] <knight_verse> I got Javiik after the Virmire Survivor rejoined my team, it just made more sense to take them back.
[0:11:28] <Coystick> BABY
[0:11:28] <%sniffy77> this is why cheaters never win
[0:11:29] <dawarw0lf> The guide  didn’t mention to do the first mission after citadel 2. You’ll know why when you get there.
[0:11:35] <stantheman_97> "works on my machine"
[0:11:42] <$Futurecity10> it takes like 2 seconds
[0:11:42] <RedPlasticCup> elmoooooo good boy
[0:11:44] <%jackelzxaa> Did you use a mass effect 3 and not an LE one?
[0:11:49] <%jackelzxaa> Theyre on different ue builds
[0:11:50] <%ahomeschooldropout> Yea idk I did it on a fresh save so maybe that did it or something. You're not missing much by not doing the fetch quests
[0:11:50] <thehark90> There are plenty of war assets to go around

[0:13:03] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! Played the Back 4 Blood Beta, and it seems pretty shit. Every single change they made to the L4D formula has made the experience worse, from currency to weapon attachments, ammo, levels, and special infected. Hard pass for me.
[0:13:09] <%machshop> yes
[0:13:13] <+Vork88> pat can you check out my sims 4 character i made of you and woolie and see if i need to add anything else?

[0:13:37] <Coystick> scan gang
[0:13:41] <%TheYellowcouch> Imagine if the car mechanics who want you to change things you don't need followed you home to your own garage
[0:13:42] <knight_verse> The scanning isn't even that bad in ME3, you can do it within minutes and then move on.
[0:13:43] <%UvBenServed> DID YOU TRY TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN THO
[0:13:43] <%trackles_64> what u get for cheating
[0:13:47] <%ElectricEmissary> LUL
[0:13:50] <@commanderclaw> "It works for me, you must be dumb" seems to be the sentiment
[0:13:50] <Deasmeister> @jackelzxaa Once you have save file from 1 and 2 isn't War assets easier than before
[0:13:52] <atgithursdays> cranky boy
[0:13:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> Yea that's the one I used idk what happened
[0:13:55] <%jackelzxaa> Just do some reaper stuff as you go and say fuck it if they bitch at you with reaper noises
[0:13:58] <thehark90> Did you try talking nice to it?
[0:14:01] <dawarw0lf> I’m sure Pat can ignore all of them and still be fine in the end
[0:14:02] <Profmcstevie> Yes the very well known and stable Mass Effect games, it's GOTTA be the user
[0:14:06] <%Movemeister> Cheaters never prosper Kappa
[0:14:08] <+vaderxyz1970> i heard if you put your routing number and bank info in chat your computer works like magic afterword

[0:14:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Some people find it easier to assign blame than to help resolve an issue. You know what you're doing.
[0:14:28] <robosqueeb> troubleshooting? fuck you! lol
[0:14:29] <SaltyAzteca> Defend their honour LUL
[0:14:29] <%mike2hands> seee what u mean
[0:14:33] <peachy996> Well it's because it's always your fault. Don't you know?
[0:14:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> Tech support is bad for that.
[0:14:35] <ChungusQuest> People don't know about the divine inception of chaos when new software and hardware touch for the first time.
[0:14:37] <%dooscent> have you been cursed by tech wizards lately
[0:14:38] <mr_saturday93> We love you Pat please don't hate us BibleThump

[0:14:39] <dekkitout> I ask having personally fucked up my mod installs
[0:14:42] <%VictorVonLouche> Not like it could be that a 3080 might just not be compatible with said mod
[0:14:43] <%Ixiah> Get best Boi Javik today Kappa
[0:14:45] <Profmcstevie> Like some warped survivors bias
[0:14:45] <%jackelzxaa> Reapers go away after you do a mission and they keep logs of what you scanned.  I’ll just go around and mash scan and then escape

[0:15:32] <%AgniBrandt> I feel like a lot of people don't realize that "The problem is on your end" and "the problem is your fault" are two different things
[0:15:42] <Srthunda> I can hear the geif
[0:15:42] <%trackles_64> a brainerism?
[0:15:44] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyNana PEEPO
[0:15:48] <%Dakuu75> What's wrong with Nexus?
[0:15:52] <%AgniBrandt> So they get oddly defensive over that stuff
[0:15:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> Nexus has a habit of tatlitarian actions that screw over mod creators.
[0:16:04] <%CatastropheCorvid> *Totalitarian,
[0:16:05] <RockinLockin> The people running Nexus are not fantastic, apparently.
[0:16:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> There's a cool first person mod for ME3 where it's only when you're exploring, however I found out it caused my game to crash 100% if I tried doing Leviathan
[0:16:09] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:16:09] <%AgniBrandt> Nexus is about to stop letting people delete their mods from the site.
[0:16:09] <%king_wragles> Single point of failure, but other than that SUPER unlikely scenario they're fine
[0:16:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt the people at nexus has been weird on some things and have a habit of screwing over people
[0:16:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> I did not
[0:16:13] <%jackelzxaa> Modding for normal me3 was a nightmare because it needed texture mods too
[0:16:14] <mr_saturday93> Fuck spelling
[0:16:22] <%VictorVonLouche> No thats wrong
[0:16:24] <dekkitout> Corvid, put my thoughts somewhat succinctly
[0:16:24] <+OneSullenBrit> Tittylion action
[0:16:27] <%Garthunox> "works on my machine" - pat
[0:16:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> Mod packs, creator's rights, things like that.
[0:16:28] <ChungusQuest> I see what you did there LUL
[0:16:29] <+Rikufmix21> modders are being babies cuz they cant delete mods for no reason anymore
[0:16:29] <RockinLockin> Nexus is a fantastic service yep!
[0:16:31] <@commanderclaw> Some people have been throwing shitfits over Nexus requiring them to not unlist their mods
[0:16:31] <%VictorVonLouche> They just wanted to achive the content
[0:16:32] <%ElectricEmissary> unironically, Nexus works fine for mw
[0:16:32] <robosqueeb> so, works for you?
[0:16:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> So what you're saying is "works on my machine Kappa"
[0:16:33] <+D00msDayDan> i bet they still eat lays chips
[0:16:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Apparently creators are mad that they won't be able to delete their mods from other people's computers
[0:16:36] <Coystick> Consumers always win baby
[0:16:36] <%KishinGrek> any updates on Audacity?
[0:16:36] <%Ixiah> works for me Kappa
[0:16:36] <OldManDeckardCain> "works for me" says Pat Kappa
[0:16:36] <Latija> nexus is fine, people are mad because you can't delete mods anymore
[0:16:37] <%jackelzxaa> Some major me series modder had a big shitfit with nexus staff and caused drama
[0:16:38] <%king_wragles> Porn mods
[0:16:39] <@commanderclaw> Like fucking Arthmoor, fucking loser
[0:16:43] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah
[0:16:43] <%ElectricEmissary> *fine, me
[0:16:45] <robosqueeb> works for me Kappa
[0:16:45] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, that seems to be it.
[0:16:50] <%TubeMan642> TubeMan642 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[0:16:53] <ape_hawk> so what youre saying, pat, it works fine for you?
[0:16:56] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[0:17:06] <%Garthunox> Garthunox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 21 month streak! You ever think of playing the Fist of the North Star Yakuza game?
[0:17:07] <dawarw0lf> Modders are a bunch of weirdos
[0:17:08] <+Scevda> Sup, lets go get Garrus
[0:17:10] <stantheman_97> why is that a bad thing?
[0:17:11] <RockinLockin> Yeah people lost their shit LUL
[0:17:12] <%QueequegTheater> I literally don't even understand the problem
[0:17:18] <Latija> some guy on nexus deleted his extremely popular Skyrim mod because trump won
[0:17:23] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> fun fact woolie is streaming da power rangers
[0:17:24] <%trackles_64> he big mad
[0:17:26] <+vaderxyz1970> How is archiving a mod bad?
[0:17:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> But it's MY free mod, obviously
[0:17:29] <rekinom> Would you say that the Nexus works fine for you? Kappa
[0:17:30] <@commanderclaw> Modders have weridly large egos
[0:17:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt They'll delete some mods for some things and don't let people delete others. but yeah I don't get it ether
[0:17:35] <Coystick> When you put something on the internet, it's there forever. That's the age old rule
[0:17:38] <+Scevda> @queequegtheater its all about control.
[0:17:39] <%Mr_Pylon> Like they want to keep total control of their mod in perpetuity?
[0:17:47] <%VictorVonLouche> Ego basically
[0:17:49] <tanarath> No mods allowed, only vanilla DS!
[0:17:53] <RushUnplugged> I get their point but also, I needed to reinstall a Skyrim mod I used before and it was gone, and it screwed my old save
[0:17:53] <RockinLockin> I think it is just an issue of "Ownership" I guess?
[0:17:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> Mod packs are a problem because supporting them is a nightmare, and some modders de-list mods when they determine that they can't fix certain issues.
[0:17:55] <%trackles_64> collective outrage iver nothing
[0:17:56] <+tempestzephyr> someone MAD on THE internet? what no way?
[0:17:57] <%mike2hands> @Latija  lol what a cringe loser
[0:17:57] <%Pappajimbo> hoes mad *50
[0:18:00] <peachy996> @Scevda And how you take it
[0:18:05] <%machshop> UGH YOU DON'T GET IT
[0:18:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Outside of the GNU license that most software uses
[0:18:07] <mr_whalefarmer> bring back benoit?
[0:18:08] <ChungusQuest> no explain, only rage
[0:18:14] <OldManDeckardCain> Pat would know that of course LUL
[0:18:15] <%jackelzxaa> Pat was it thanemod guy?  That guy is a weirdo
[0:18:15] <Flame_Water> streaming and you cant read my mind?
[0:18:17] <%Solid_Stro> Manifesto sounds so “up your own ass” whenever I hear it. c4sageLUL
[0:18:19] <+Scevda> @peachy996 sup again
[0:18:22] <dawarw0lf> Like I understand the frustration with the console mod ports done without consent but to delete it so no one gets it?
[0:18:26] <%VictorVonLouche> They just want the power to take it down. So if people annoy them they can just do the power move of removing the mod
[0:18:26] <%jackelzxaa> They made some of the biggest me update mods
[0:18:30] <Coystick> [MODIFIED SHRIEKING]
[0:18:32] <JetpackMcQuack> But not really
[0:18:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> There were this mod-team that ported COD weapons to gmod that got really fucking pissed over a youtuber adding their mod to his Steam workshop collection and it's like bruh you just ripped other people's work
[0:18:34] <Vi_Stri> you would think they'd care more about sharing the cool stuff they made with the community
[0:18:34] <robosqueeb> complaining about being taken advantage of is stupid
[0:18:38] <peachy996> It's all about the Game and how you play it
[0:18:40] <+vaderxyz1970> I cant let them know i'm only pissed off that my chicken sandwich doesnt come with ketchup
[0:18:42] <+AmericanSkidd> early start today?
[0:18:48] <%Pappajimbo> "I dont want solutions. I want to be angry!!"
[0:18:48] <%QueequegTheater> "No, but WHY are they fascists?" "THEY'RE FASCISTS!"
[0:18:49] <%trackles_64> Every CONSERVATIVE EVER
[0:18:51] <Profmcstevie> I have been mistreated! "how" .....I have been mistreated!
[0:18:53] <+Scevda> NO TAKE, ONLY MOD
[0:18:54] <%machshop> uhhh okay so what's the problem
[0:18:55] <tanarath> Oh no
[0:18:55] <%lilytastic> there were some massive Skyrim mods that got deleted because the mod author got mad about politics and thought gamers shouldn't benefit from his work anymore
[0:18:56] <stantheman_97> good that's some history we have to save
[0:19:00] <%YakumoYomi> But what about big titty ME mods?
[0:19:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> people are weirdly invested in those nude mods
[0:19:01] <%TheYellowcouch> BUT THINK OF THE TIDDIES! WON'T SOMEONE THINK OF THE TIDDIES
[0:19:02] <%snow_bush> The answer is obvious. We all move to loverslab. A noncontrovertial move.
[0:19:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> "They're a fascist because they did something I don't like" is the basic lofic
[0:19:04] <JetpackMcQuack> Those big titties belong to the world now
[0:19:05] <%Ixiah> that IS titalitarien
[0:19:05] <%QueequegTheater> @trackles_64 lol
[0:19:11] <%Dakuu75> Once it's out there... it's OUT there... That's why you don't post newds
[0:19:14] <+fetrigon> why are you awake? LUL
[0:19:16] <+Rikufmix21> they cant delete it for attention
[0:19:19] <+AmericanSkidd> what are they trying to do to my big tiddy skyrim mods?
[0:19:20] <Latija> @lilytastic it was the civil war overhaul
[0:19:27] <Mattais88> Remember: censoring anime titties is facism and/or westren pandering
[0:19:27] <DianaTheAscian> but why delete it?
[0:19:28] <dekkitout> @CatastropheCorvid Almost every time a means to interact with mods is discussed, someone takes their ball, goes home, and also wants to take your ball
[0:19:28] <%Pappajimbo> titties belong to people comrade
[0:19:29] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:19:30] <peachy996> Wasn't there some Thane mod that got taken down by the creator and bummed people out
[0:19:33] <Theo_Marks> those huge argonina knockers belong to the proletariat now
[0:19:33] <%QueequegTheater> But it's you Kappa
[0:19:33] <%Dakuu75> LOL "why are you awake?" XD
[0:19:34] <RockinLockin> Sounds like primetime bedtime to me!
[0:19:35] <%Ixiah> its 21:41
[0:19:42] <%jackelzxaa> Recallibrated?
[0:19:43] <thehark90> Afternoon reaper killing delight time
[0:19:43] <%lilytastic> @Latija yeah i just wasn't sure about naming and shaming but he did a buncha stuff
[0:19:44] <Profmcstevie> Why do you exist
[0:19:47] <Profmcstevie> How dare you
[0:20:02] <chicken_apostle> BAD
[0:20:02] <%za7az> D:
[0:20:02] <@commanderclaw> Metroid 1 is jank AF
[0:20:02] <Coystick> Right after Andromeda
[0:20:04] <OldManDeckardCain> pat only likes 3d metroid
[0:20:04] <nesbitt22> its 12:41pm Pat
[0:20:07] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> dude I'd love to watch you play the Prime games considering you mention them pretty often
[0:20:10] <%Dakuu75> [Gasp]
[0:20:11] <%king_wragles> Just do the Prime Games
[0:20:15] <%hatok> prime is rad that's what
[0:20:15] <%king_wragles> It means you like Prime
[0:20:16] <DianaTheAscian> out
[0:20:16] <+vaderxyz1970> You like Scifi FPS?
[0:20:18] <%KishinGrek> never liked any Metroid
[0:20:18] <%SaiyanShoto> RIOT
[0:20:18] <%king_wragles> that's fine
[0:20:20] <peachy996> Says you like Metriod asa shooter
[0:20:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> That you have taste?
[0:20:22] <Theo_Marks> metroid 1 is jank, but the GBA remake improves on it greatly
[0:20:26] <%Deano8817> that's fair tbh
[0:20:27] <$Futurecity10> Same, I only like the prime games and Samus returns
[0:20:30] <@commanderclaw> You like 2D Sonic, game feel is important to you
[0:20:30] <peachy996> Unless you like Fusion
[0:20:31] <tanarath> It says that you like the best part.
[0:20:34] <james_uu> Ever wanna pick up banner saga again??
[0:20:37] <JetpackMcQuack> I want a twin stick
[0:20:39] <%ElectricEmissary> that's a fair assumption
[0:20:39] <%EthorXL> Yo I would enjoy a Prime Trilogy playthrough
[0:20:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> Sadly, that's accurate
[0:20:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It means you like Halo Kappa
[0:20:42] <+SenorCounter> We have
[0:20:43] <RushUnplugged> classic Pat madness, hate Metroid but love metroidvanias
[0:20:44] <Deasmeister> Does pat like Castlevania
[0:20:44] <%AJ_Cherenkov> AJ_Cherenkov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Don't know how they handled dlc and update weapons in legendary, but some of the later guns in ME3 are pretty great.
[0:20:45] <%solracc25> Metroid prime kicks ass
[0:20:45] <+Vork88> hey pat i made you in sims 4 with woolie and wonder if you check it out and see if i got you down?
[0:20:46] <%SaiyanShoto> Maybe
[0:20:46] <+fetrigon> ye
[0:20:48] <%TheYellowcouch> the sonic jump
[0:20:49] <CatRidder> 11 years
[0:20:51] <+AmericanSkidd> BOLD ASSUMPTION
[0:20:53] <stantheman_97> yeah
[0:20:53] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh yeah i remember code veronica
[0:20:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Don't we all?
[0:20:55] <JetpackMcQuack> shadow complex was great
[0:20:57] <Theo_Marks> sonic jump bad
[0:20:58] <+OneSullenBrit> Meh, I've disliked games for less
[0:20:59] <%Deano8817> like how you LOVE pokemon unite :)
[0:20:59] <%SaiyanShoto> The Pat way
[0:21:00] <BYAKURENLOVER763> its very relatable!
[0:21:00] <%Teintstein> Teintstein subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! saturday afternoons are for old heads
[0:21:01] <%ElectricEmissary> yeah what yellow said
[0:21:05] <Profmcstevie> "ooh don't like that"
[0:21:06] <@commanderclaw> Game feel is very personal. It's a taste thing
[0:21:06] <ChungusQuest> all about the Feel
[0:21:08] <%jackelzxaa> Metroid zero mission has faster and different movement, it’s weird
[0:21:13] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yeah you've been pretty clear on that.
[0:21:17] <%trackles_64> Thats everyone pat
[0:21:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> Which is great
[0:21:22] <+Kingtut9009> @PatStaresAt It's not hard to instantly know that controls, or movement feels bad, it made games unplayable for me
[0:21:23] <freasuk> jo pat, been a fan for years, first time catching you live wanted to say hi and have a good stream.
[0:21:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Any example of games you like that still feel like dogshit? Maybe ME1?
[0:21:26] <%captain_kirkhammer> what was pat talking about earlier with modders and a manifesto or something?
[0:21:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I can put up with how a game controls if I like everything else about it enough
[0:21:31] <%king_wragles> Well now I think you're just insane
[0:21:37] <%king_wragles> Okay, that's actually super fair
[0:21:37] <dawarw0lf> Reminds me of my brother and how often he restarts RPGs
[0:21:41] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Prime 3 is so mixed and thats fair
[0:21:41] <@commanderclaw> Oof, that sucks
[0:21:47] <%KishinGrek> just like Kid Icarus
[0:21:48] <+Rikufmix21> you can play with keyboard and mouse now
[0:21:49] <Theo_Marks> Felt that way but in the opposite direction with PoE and how "clicky" every mouse click was
[0:21:50] <AllenDeadman> yikes
[0:21:55] <%king_wragles> 2 seconds for that reactionary 180
[0:21:56] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I can only emulate Prime 3
[0:21:57] <+AmericanSkidd> I love the Kingdom Hearts series but KH1 and Chain of Memories controls like ass
[0:22:00] <peachy996> Nintendo always like to damage wrists
[0:22:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Like Godhand controls like shit
[0:22:01] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It hurts too much
[0:22:01] <ChungusQuest> Yeah, it forces you to keep your wrist cocked at a fucked-up angle
[0:22:06] <Profmcstevie> How in the hell did Prime 3 hurt your wrists, you don't do shit with them
[0:22:13] <@commanderclaw> It's the wrist angle. It's non ergonomic
[0:22:14] <SilverFaustX> lol 800grams
[0:22:17] <peachy996> It's always Nintendo causing the wrist pain lol
[0:22:20] <dawarw0lf> My brother’s rpg character needs to be perfect for him to actually beat it
[0:22:21] <SilverFaustX> 80 maybe
[0:22:21] <stantheman_97> is it a wrist destroyer like kid icarus uprising
[0:22:21] <+Scevda> What was your off the cuff response to FF 15 controls?
[0:22:24] <%Solid_Stro> What about Other M? Kappa
[0:22:31] <+Vork88> @PatStaresAt hey pat i made you in sims 4 with woolie and wonder if you check it out and see if i got you down?
[0:22:33] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fucks up the tendon by the thumb. Not great.
[0:22:36] <MrPandastic> That's my relationship with Kid Icarus game on 3ds. Destroyed my hands playing that game.
[0:22:36] <tanarath> Big snore
[0:22:37] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Holding out for that nonexistent Prime Trilogy switch port
[0:22:41] <Profmcstevie> Just rest it on your thigh like I do
[0:22:42] <%jackelzxaa> I used dolphin bindings to turn prime 3 into close to gcn controls and it’s neat but a little fussy
[0:22:43] <RushUnplugged> nothing is as bad as kid icarus
[0:22:50] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @PatStaresAt You might be interested in this Dolhpin build called PrimeHack. It lets you play them like PC FPS games
[0:22:52] <%Torus1025> "It runs on my wrists"
[0:22:53] <%Ixiah> maybe when we get the remaster for switch they update the controlls Kappu
[0:22:59] <%TheYellowcouch> Yeah you gotta use the elbow to move but that's a lot so
[0:23:03] <%captain_kirkhammer> Prime 3 also had non-Metroidvanian world design
[0:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> the ff15 control situation was bad enough to make me immediately refund it
[0:23:03] <Profmcstevie> Like Skyward Sword, if you try and play it like a Miyamoto and stand up you're gonna suffer
[0:23:12] <%AncelDeLambert> TIG BITTIE TIG BITTIE
[0:23:20] <+AmericanSkidd> Yeah mine
[0:23:21] <peachy996> big titty garrus?
[0:23:34] <+Scevda> It tenses (continuously) the muscle going all the way back to the elbow the whole time. Causes tennis elbow. @patstaresat
[0:23:35] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh, hey pat. you're on early. :)
[0:23:44] <@commanderclaw> Mod makers have big egos for no good reason, it's hard to take them seriously
[0:23:53] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah that don't work, me hearties
[0:24:06] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's IP, to a degree. (How they see it)
[0:24:09] <robosqueeb> thats why the guy was like its good they're moving from nexus
[0:24:11] <%Teintstein> not how the world works
[0:24:14] <+Scevda> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[0:24:17] <%AncelDeLambert> you're working on fanfic code, kill the ego
[0:24:19] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Also I'm weird with Metroidvanias, I don't think I like the Vania part, just the Metroid, I want infinite shooty
[0:24:24] <freasuk> well i can understand working hard on something and then feeling some kind of owenership over said thing
[0:24:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> I bet $10 Nexus TOS allows them to archive shit anyway
[0:24:26] <RushUnplugged> any mod for a game published by someone else, is by default NOT your property
[0:24:27] <%jackelzxaa> SRB2 has a thriving modding community but they’re ALSO hyper protective of everything
[0:24:31] <%captain_kirkhammer> @commanderclaw some modders deserve it, the dude behind the shit Pat was playing yesterday otta be real proud of himself
[0:24:32] <%Solid_Stro> This mod is my property and IP, it’s my ART!!! lytUSEGUN
[0:24:38] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[0:24:39] <%vivaldiva> F
[0:24:41] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I didn't really vibe with Hollow Knight but loved Samus Returns
[0:24:41] <dekkitout> Blows extra hard when a mod is no longer supported and the source code isn't released
[0:24:42] <%subparSamaritan> It's happening!
[0:24:43] <%king_wragles> GAME OVER YYAAAAASA
[0:24:44] <peachy996> the cough says you LIE
[0:24:45] <%mike2hands> the metroid spite get you!!
[0:24:45] <BlueLunecy> Man dies live on stream
[0:24:46] <freasuk> good night sweet prince

[0:24:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> Survived bay life, killed by spit
[0:24:48] <Profmcstevie> Choking on your lies
[0:24:48] <+AmericanSkidd> its HAPPENING
[0:24:49] <%TheYellowcouch> it's happening
[0:24:49] <Daskolin> I am mod maker. And say its true for many of us. NOT ALL, BUT MANY
[0:24:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[0:24:51] <%cvp5127> finally
[0:24:51] <%barrakuta371> ItsHappening
[0:24:51] <dawarw0lf> Just do what the Forgotten City team and make it a IP and different game. Then you do own it
[0:24:51] <%trackles_64> F APt
[0:24:53] <%SaiyanShoto> Castlevania is killing him!
[0:24:53] <%AncelDeLambert> remember, folks, Pat had no childhood
[0:24:54] <RedPlasticCup> pat dies on stream
[0:24:54] <stantheman_97> PAT DEATH ON STREAM
[0:24:54] <%Teintstein> SAMUS pls let him live

[0:24:57] <%trackles_64> F Pat
[0:24:57] <%AJ_Cherenkov> choking on spit is the worst
[0:24:58] <OldManDeckardCain> some angry modder put a hex on you LUL
[0:24:59] <%YakumoYomi> No

[0:25:08] <%ElectricEmissary> sometimes
[0:25:08] <%MidnightBurst12> yeah, it sucks
[0:25:08] <%VictorVonLouche> its the worst
[0:25:09] <4DLuvOfLuthy> always lol
[0:25:09] <%Ixiah> if u die, look into the camera, paige can sell the vod
[0:25:10] <%barrakuta371> Only during allergy season
[0:25:11] <Profmcstevie> occasionally
[0:25:11] <%hatok> oh yeah that's the worst
[0:25:12] <Daskolin> YES
[0:25:12] <+Alig200> yes, it fucking sucks
[0:25:12] <stantheman_97> rarely
[0:25:13] <+fromnibelheim> yes
[0:25:13] <%ForlornCarton> It has happened
[0:25:13] <@commanderclaw> The human body is bullshit
[0:25:13] <+fetrigon> I hate when it happens yes LUL
[0:25:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That was Dracula trying to kill you
[0:25:14] <Lee_The_Limey> DansGame at least get to the title screen before you die Pat
[0:25:15] <+CammerTime21> every day
[0:25:15] <%TheYellowcouch> I am terrible at drinking
[0:25:17] <Manwad> every day
[0:25:17] <DianaTheAscian> the comming of a divine will
[0:25:18] <freasuk> there is a mod for not chocking on stream but you have to pay for it
[0:25:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh yeah all the time
[0:25:20] <robosqueeb> nope it works for me
[0:25:21] <macathelo> overweight problem
[0:25:21] <%Woodywoo0100> Oh thank god its not just me
[0:25:21] <%ElectricEmissary> I mean no, definitely not
[0:25:22] <%ahomeschooldropout> I do it with water and then the back of my throat itches and I FUCKING HATE IT
[0:25:22] <SaltyAzteca> humans are so fragile
[0:25:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt often
[0:25:24] <%solracc25> yes
[0:25:24] <Coystick> I'm choking on air
[0:25:24] <%Movemeister> We all succumb to the spit
[0:25:25] <+Rikufmix21> a few times before
[0:25:27] <Profmcstevie> MY SPECIES HAS BEEN TO THE MOON, I CAN'T DIE LIKE THIS
[0:25:27] <dekkitout> That's just failing a breathing qte
[0:25:27] <mr_saturday93> Choke on nothing!
[0:25:28] <tanarath> I drink water too fast & nearly die from that
[0:25:29] <$Ziegsy> My mum told me it was because you said something mean about someone
[0:25:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> its the worst at work when you have a ton of customers looking at you during *the times*
[0:25:32] <%SaiyanShoto> Happens all the time I just put my hands up and it’s gone
[0:25:32] <stantheman_97> our bodies are built to fail
[0:25:35] <%ElectricEmissary> never happened ever and if you saw it I was acting
[0:25:39] <@commanderclaw> Oh yeah, that was totally justified
[0:25:39] <ChungusQuest> It's a not-so-gentle reminder that our bodies are eager to betray us at a moment's notice
[0:25:42] <dawarw0lf> I hate doing in public “I SWEAR I DONT HAVE THE COVID”
[0:25:42] <Laecerelius> That paid mod stuff was a huge shitshow
[0:25:43] <%jackelzxaa> I had to use custom control bindings in super metroid because it controls so weird.  I basically use joy2key to make every metroid game play like am2r down to adding a morph ball button and a missile hold button
[0:25:44] <%AJ_Cherenkov> It can get much worse, I've had times where I choked on spit, and that caused me to start hiccuping, preventing me from clearing the spit.
[0:25:50] <%trackles_64> Bethesda steals peoples mods to make fall out 4
[0:25:51] <SilverFaustX> "man dies after swallowing"
[0:25:52] <dekkitout> The bethesda net one where people also flipped other people's mods
[0:25:58] <%AncelDeLambert> thank fuck for Patreon
[0:26:09] <%SaiyanShoto> @ziegsy he was talking shit on Metroid so I guess that counts LUL
[0:26:10] <mr_saturday93> @silverfaustx  giggity
[0:26:16] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a personal project, and it will always ONLY be a personal project
[0:26:17] <ChungusQuest> it's code-based fanfic
[0:26:19] <+Scevda> @aj_cherenkov your diaphragm and esophagus are fighting lol.
[0:26:21] <+fetrigon> @anceldelambert SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:26:23] <peachy996> man dies after swallowing, last words are "I like castlevania"
[0:26:28] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a fan-fic but with programming
[0:26:32] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @Scevda precisely
[0:26:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> That's why some modders have opened Patreons and/or release mods through discord now.
[0:26:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> If you're doing it for profit, don't host your mods on a site where people can dl them for free
[0:26:38] <+AmericanSkidd> big difference
[0:26:42] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, the difference between a tip jar and an upfront charge
[0:26:46] <%trackles_64> I mena the game owners own the ip
[0:26:47] <Coystick> That Archstones shit looks bananas
[0:26:48] <tanarath> Yeah, the Patron is a better business model.
[0:26:54] <$Ziegsy> @SaiyanShoto Dont let my mum know, its sets a dangerous precedent of her being right
[0:26:56] <stantheman_97> it's kinda profiting off of someone else's work, unless you're making an entirely new game out of it
[0:26:57] <%captain_kirkhammer> CK2's After the End mod has that, "give us money and we'll keep adding assets"
[0:26:58] <$Ziegsy> PEEPEE
[0:26:59] <+AmericanSkidd> its da baby
[0:27:02] <Protologo> kitty!
[0:27:03] <%AncelDeLambert> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[0:27:03] <%jackelzxaa> Speaking of fan shit, did you know that sonic colors remaster uses a fan render of metal sonic for the race icon and that’s totally uh-oh
[0:27:06] <%mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:27:09] <%trackles_64> Cat butt
[0:27:13] <tanarath> And I hate how it's shit, but eh
[0:27:15] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:27:16] <%SaiyanShoto> I hate Castlevania 2
[0:27:17] <%mike2hands> perfect segway
[0:27:20] <%AncelDeLambert> baaaaby our beloved baaaaaby
[0:27:20] <tanarath> Elmo!
[0:27:20] <dagreenpillow> *points* ELMO
[0:27:20] <+Scevda> what was your initial response to FF15 and 7R.
[0:27:22] <freasuk> i feel like on other games pat woul let "we made it bad on purpose" slide but whatever
[0:27:23] <%trackles_64> Bye elmo
[0:27:25] <%Ixiah> why is Elmos cattree not behind you ? :(
[0:27:27] <%mike2hands> RUDE
[0:27:30] <Profmcstevie> Castlevania Bloodlines/Rondo is a fantastic pinnacle of classicvania design
[0:27:30] <+AmericanSkidd> as it should be
[0:27:31] <dawarw0lf> Heheh
[0:27:36] <stantheman_97> elbow? too high
[0:27:37] <%MidnightBurst12> so realistic? Kappa
[0:27:38] <peachy996> so it needs to be shorter?
[0:27:41] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[0:27:43] <%Solid_Stro> I like deliberate shit over accidental
[0:27:44] <%SaiyanShoto> Should be shorter
[0:27:44] <peachy996> Like the knees?
[0:27:45] <%TheYellowcouch> still taller than when viking draws ya lol
[0:27:45] <Mattais88> not fair, Woolie has long arms
[0:27:52] <+ComfortableStranger> psaBlep_SG
[0:27:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Help. I have a cat that literally jumps into my lap and rubs up against my face
[0:27:55] <+Scevda> Never should have sent out the ch
[0:28:00] <stantheman_97> haha short
[0:28:04] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Geif do snore
[0:28:09] <+Scevda> Never should have sent out that choco-bunny pic
[0:28:10] <stormhawk9891> Did you just fart?
[0:28:14] <%SaiyanShoto> I thought Elmo was making those noises
[0:28:21] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[0:28:23] <%jackelzxaa> “Tiny pat jokes”  “oh no this one is too real”
[0:28:33] <dawarw0lf> Skill Up thinks it’s ok
[0:28:35] <%Solid_Stro> psaDogchamp *Snore*
[0:28:35] <mr_saturday93> Sad to hear that ResidentSleeper
[0:28:42] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> ammo levels??
[0:28:43] <%AncelDeLambert> waaah waaah waaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[0:28:44] <%Teintstein> welp
[0:28:46] <%ahomeschooldropout> Back 4 Blood has worse gore, too
[0:28:46] <%Larry_Q> Back4Blood rocks what?
[0:28:46] <Blank9> yeah it looks awful
[0:28:48] <@commanderclaw> It feels bloated
[0:28:51] <chicken_apostle> just play killing floor 2 lmao
[0:28:53] <Mattais88> You can see the moment all hope leaves him
[0:28:54] <%king_wragles> The devs straight up said they're not gonna just make L4D2-2
[0:28:54] <dawarw0lf> Skill Up just has a couple of issues
[0:28:54] <peachy996> I dunno I hear other people like it
[0:28:55] <%TheYellowcouch> Oh yeah I watched my friend play it and he beat a boss while downed cause the boss couldn't kill him lol
[0:28:57] <%KishinGrek> sent u a beta code Pat, yesterday
[0:28:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I liked the beta
[0:29:05] <@commanderclaw> Just My opinion, take it as you will
[0:29:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Herd it was more rougelite
[0:29:11] <+Nahual_Amini> But game good
[0:29:14] <%AncelDeLambert> have the GTA guys been investigated for creepy sex shit yet?
[0:29:15] <%LumberjackJack> It's still okay. Not terrible, but doesn't feel as good as L4D, I'll admit that
[0:29:15] <SilverFaustX> FotN is on sale for 10 on psn
[0:29:19] <DatAsuna> the early guns are good too
[0:29:19] <%Solid_Stro> Oh
[0:29:22] <peachy996> Yeah the later weapons are good
[0:29:23] <dawarw0lf> Skill Up has concerns with pvp and the annual pass
[0:29:29] <DatAsuna> They definitely kicked the pre-order guns later
[0:29:45] <peachy996> That Interrupt is not that special
[0:29:52] <%LumberjackJack> Because... why not? I dunno
[0:29:54] <%captain_kirkhammer> It wasn't supposed ot be the lasst oner
[0:29:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Engineer Vindication
[0:29:56] <+Kingtut9009> It has a lot of potential, but the Versus is a joke and they're against campaign versus, and balance is kinda fucked right now
[0:29:58] <@commanderclaw> For the next game ideally, like Fromsoft experimenting in DS3
[0:30:00] <DatAsuna> Citadel was last, but basically they wanted to have fun
[0:30:00] <%bread_assassin> Each class shoulda got one unique interupt.
[0:30:01] <%Mr_Pylon> In Andromeda!
[0:30:01] <ZeromusPrime93> Holy shit, finally managed to catch a Pat livestream for the 1st time
[0:30:02] <%MidnightBurst12> practice for other series?
[0:30:05] <+D00msDayDan> really paid off in anthem
[0:30:05] <%Deano8817> anthem :)
[0:30:06] <DatAsuna> SWTOR uses it
[0:30:07] <+vaderxyz1970> probably for the next game series?
[0:30:13] <peachy996> But anyway back to guns, ALL of them are worth testing out in the Shooting Range
[0:30:15] <DatAsuna> CLass exclusive dialogue/choices
[0:30:21] <Deasmeister> Well I'm sure ideally they wanted it to continue
[0:30:22] <DianaTheAscian> in new ip
[0:30:26] <%SaiyanShoto> They probably thought they were gonna use it in their next game
[0:30:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> Omega also has a questline where it's the perfect example of Paragon or Renegade where you can either do some scanning minigame bullshit to help a dude out, or just let a literal psychopath out of prison cause fuck that shit
[0:30:29] <%trackles_64> Pres A
[0:30:32] <SilverFaustX> FLYING HORSE
[0:30:36] <chicken_apostle> jumping isn't fucking real
[0:30:36] <DatAsuna> the omega DLC shares some animations with SWTOR as well. lol
[0:30:36] <%TheYellowcouch> HORSE DOUBLE JUMP!
[0:30:38] <$Ziegsy> Chat My chilli dog gfuel arrived, and they sent me peach rings as a bonus. Its tasty. help
[0:30:42] <%sniffy77> Elden Ring aka Big Dark Souls
[0:30:46] <@commanderclaw> YEP
[0:30:48] <+AmericanSkidd> good ass game
[0:30:51] <JetpackMcQuack> slowly approaching the perfect game
[0:30:56] <@commanderclaw> If it does all the good and none of the bad it's great
[0:31:00] <Coystick> See the cut whip version of Midir that looks like the Elen Ring dragon?
[0:31:01] <%trackles_64> Well its been a shit year for games
[0:31:04] <artoflec> eh, open world can go very badly
[0:31:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> But it has a map, so it's clearly trash
[0:31:04] <Profmcstevie> As good as Sekiro? That's a classic
[0:31:10] <DatAsuna> emlo
[0:31:10] <bubbli97> i'd be fucking happy with the game if it was that lol
[0:31:10] <%Solid_Stro> I’m okay with that
[0:31:11] <ChungusQuest> yeah but even the fucked parts might be entertaining
[0:31:11] <SilverFaustX> ELMO
[0:31:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Right there, I can see it
[0:31:13] <Deasmeister> Sekiro with more weapon variety would be great
[0:31:13] <%Teintstein> psaElmo
[0:31:14] <peachy996> Something about it WILL BE Unfinished
[0:31:15] <ZeromusPrime93> CAT
[0:31:15] <%VioletHeart> VioletHeart subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! Javik time? Javik time.
[0:31:16] <%mike2hands> maybe the skill tree is gonna be fucky
[0:31:17] <dawarw0lf> Texture pop in. That’s my guess
[0:31:17] <xcompleasedad> That's nearly game of the DECADE
[0:31:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> I WANT LIPS TO MOVE
[0:31:19] <%trackles_64> F
[0:31:20] <+AmericanSkidd> oh yeah button time
[0:31:20] <blackjack8182> Elden Ring sounds like what From wanted to do with Dark Souls 2
[0:31:20] <%LumberjackJack> YEYEYEYE
[0:31:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> LIP MOVEMENT
[0:31:20] <%Pappajimbo> jank multiplayer
[0:31:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> No Signal, my favorite game
[0:31:25] <%TheYellowcouch> Hi no signal!
[0:31:26] <+AmericanSkidd> WOOH
[0:31:27] <stantheman_97> it's a fromsoft game so there will besome fuck
[0:31:28] <@commanderclaw> No Signal is my favorite video game
[0:31:29] <Mattais88> hero of the Citadel: No Signal
[0:31:32] <+Inferno_Icon> unless george r r fucks the story like the game of thrones
[0:31:35] <ZeromusPrime93> woolieGASM
[0:31:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Elden ring better have lip movement or no buy
[0:31:36] <4DLuvOfLuthy> No signal, the superior host!
[0:31:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Personally I didn’t like Sekiro too much, the combat got repetitive so fast
[0:31:39] <%Dakuu75> I saw a meme of a tombstone that said "Died from nothing. (We're all pretty confused about it honestly)" I wish I could find it again
[0:31:40] <bubbli97> bet the PvP will be fucking horrible, like it was in every other Souls game @PatStaresAt
[0:31:43] <%Solid_Stro> FromSoft jank is charming
[0:31:46] <DatAsuna> lip sync too hard
[0:31:48] <JetpackMcQuack> THERE'S NO TIME
[0:31:50] <%captain_kirkhammer> good, lip movement is wasted assets in this kinda game
[0:31:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> FUCK THAT
[0:31:52] <%Astrophizz> easier to not make faces
[0:31:55] <+AmericanSkidd> last time we got lips moving was DS2 so...
[0:31:56] <%saiko2208> The homie No Signal
[0:31:56] <DatAsuna> I don't find the jank charming
[0:32:02] <peachy996> It's too hard
[0:32:02] <%KishinGrek> new Red waifu
[0:32:04] <dawarw0lf> BIRD MAN TIME
[0:32:04] <Deasmeister> Sekiro had lip movement wasnt there?
[0:32:04] <das_sensentier> Yo, happy you made ME3 work!
[0:32:06] <%mike2hands> why bother
[0:32:06] <+tempestzephyr> screw that
[0:32:06] <DianaTheAscian> i never want the lips to move
[0:32:10] <RushUnplugged> GRRM literally wrote a basic plot on a napkin years ago and that's it
[0:32:10] <mr_saturday93> @inferno_icon did GRRM fuck up GOT? or was it the showrunners?
[0:32:11] <peachy996> Fromsoft can't do it.
[0:32:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> They just don't wanna do the lips
[0:32:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck it
[0:32:14] <DatAsuna> the quest structure and loading instances shit is more annoying to me than lipsync
[0:32:16] <Profmcstevie> IF WE DO LIP SYNC WE NEED TO DO IT FOR EVERY LANGUAGE
[0:32:18] <%TheYellowcouch> It's like when artists draw characters with their hands in the pockets cause hands hard
[0:32:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz they can't
[0:32:20] <%YakumoYomi> Elden Ring's page on Steam has a January 20th release date. Was that already known?
[0:32:22] <stantheman_97> didn't sekiro have lip sync?
[0:32:23] <blackjack8182> I’m sure the feet will look better than the faces
[0:32:25] <Srthunda> cat crimes
[0:32:26] <%TheYellowcouch> also hello I am artists
[0:32:28] <DatAsuna> I just don't want to have to teleport away and teleport back to advance dialogue
[0:32:35] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[0:32:43] <+AmericanSkidd> did you do the modding?
[0:32:45] <+Inferno_Icon> @mr_saturday93 yes
[0:32:48] <Profmcstevie> The gameplay trailer had a release date
[0:33:00] <%jackelzxaa> Go get javik
[0:33:01] <%Movemeister> It’s happening again WutFace
[0:33:01] <ZeromusPrime93> That's a helluva cough...
[0:33:02] <+AmericanSkidd> oh boy
[0:33:04] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[0:33:04] <@commanderclaw> Then God's an asshole
[0:33:05] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh god
[0:33:06] <peachy996> YAY Manual Scanning!
[0:33:06] <%LumberjackJack> You must suffer like we did :)
[0:33:08] <Laecerelius> Manual scanning?!  How primitive!
[0:33:11] <%jackelzxaa> Get javik and put him on your boat
[0:33:11] <4DLuvOfLuthy> uh oh
[0:33:12] <Profmcstevie> Gods got bad ideas
[0:33:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> Get Javik right now.
[0:33:13] <xcompleasedad> GOOD
[0:33:14] <+Alig200> did you use a scanning mod for ME2 Pat?
[0:33:14] <peachy996> Enjoy my pain :D
[0:33:15] <%jackelzxaa> Go to eden prime
[0:33:17] <Profmcstevie> have you seen the platypus
[0:33:17] <RedPlasticCup> :)
[0:33:19] <%MidnightBurst12> god made a mistake
[0:33:21] <mr_saturday93> @inferno_icon As someone who's never watched or read GOT I'm not really surprised
[0:33:27] <GuyverTypeL> That sucks, at least we are togeeeetheeeer
[0:33:27] <%trackles_64> Careful the reapers are coming
[0:33:30] <%Rookie_Balboa> scanning wasnt so bad, maybe like an hour total of my playtime was doing this
[0:33:32] <SilverFaustX> u dont have the overlay anymore ?
[0:33:33] <peachy996> That bar go up
[0:33:34] <%LumberjackJack> Batarian homeworld!
[0:33:36] <Shockmaster182> Do you think Shepard wipes after he shits
[0:33:37] <$Futurecity10> Thats the batarian homeworld
[0:33:42] <%Rookie_Balboa> you can also just google what planets to scan
[0:33:42] <das_sensentier> Oh hey its the batarian homeworld
[0:33:45] <+AmericanSkidd> YOU SHOULD READ THIS PLANET
[0:33:51] <dawarw0lf> MONEY
[0:33:52] <Mattais88> Quest item
[0:33:53] <+akscully> it's for a future quest
[0:33:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's the Batarian Homeworld.
[0:34:00] <dawarw0lf> it will give credits
[0:34:00] <Profmcstevie> READ PLANET
[0:34:01] <%trackles_64> Artifacts give quests and dialouge
[0:34:04] <peachy996> You can scan and get items before the quest pops up
[0:34:04] <Daskolin> BATARIAN HOMEWORLD??! Nuke it! KILL IT SHEPARD!!!
[0:34:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> You need to read about it.
[0:34:07] <peachy996> BWOOOOOM
[0:34:07] <mr_saturday93> That dirty batarian homeworld
[0:34:07] <%Movemeister> Just read the blurb of this planet
[0:34:13] <+Scevda> Relic
[0:34:14] <ZeromusPrime93> I never played ME so I have NO CLUE what any of this is
[0:34:16] <dekkitout> Bass drop of death
[0:34:16] <@commanderclaw> Reapers sound like a cyborg fart
[0:34:18] <%ahomeschooldropout> you can pick up quest items for later
[0:34:19] <%Dakuu75> I dig that "BRRRRRRRR" noise though
[0:34:20] <xcompleasedad> The Batarian homeworld LUL Just fly by North Korea
[0:34:27] <blackjack8182> The journal is worthless. Just scan every planet in every system.
[0:34:28] <mr_saturday93> Man that sound is soooooo good
[0:34:28] <RushUnplugged> @PatStaresAt you can exit from anywhere on the borders, not just the arrows
[0:34:34] <Deasmeister> You can joke them
[0:34:35] <%hatok> so every time you do a mission reaper alterness resets
[0:34:45] <Deasmeister> *juke
[0:34:47] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat “wouldnt it have been cool to fly the normandy through space with reapers and shit?”  Monkey’s paw curls
[0:34:47] <%captain_kirkhammer> @xcompleasedad combination NK and Confederate States of America
[0:34:50] <%trackles_64> money
[0:34:53] <peachy996> It always resets them and where they come in from
[0:34:53] <+Scevda> @patstaresat theres literally nothing to be scared of.
[0:34:53] <DatAsuna> meow
[0:34:55] <%KishinGrek> gimme fuel, gimme fire gimme nadabaduzah
[0:34:56] <+Inferno_Icon> werent you gonna big mod the scanning?
[0:35:00] <dawarw0lf> You gotta zig zag the rippers and juke them
[0:35:03] <+galaktic> the reapers don't approach you while you're in a scanner menu either, so you can actually just fly up to the planets and loot em even while they're chasing you
[0:35:05] <PraiseHemra> these reaper bits are way too silly
[0:35:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You missed the Batarian Homeworld.
[0:35:12] <%saiko2208> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[0:35:12] <ZeromusPrime93> D A N G E R
[0:35:16] <thehark90> credits are hard to come by in ME 3 so get as much as you can
[0:35:19] <%greasypete00> what if they made an ME mmo
[0:35:20] <peachy996> So with enough practice you can easily bypass this stupid mechanic and juke them
[0:35:22] <+AmericanSkidd> They hate it
[0:35:29] <ChungusQuest> CAUTION: SPACE TUBAS
[0:35:30] <knight_verse> Fun Fact: You can refuel for free by docking in the Citadel.
[0:35:42] <KnightOfTrousers> "Missed the Batarian world? Eh, nothing of value there"
[0:35:42] <OldManDeckardCain> oh no, not the prime turist spot - the batarian homeworld
[0:35:44] <%jackelzxaa> The reapers chased pat off his lawn
[0:35:45] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt protip for when reapers show up, you can just leave, go back and run through while scanning or getting the items, no need to wait til you do another mission
[0:35:46] <dawarw0lf> I’ve never once waited for the reapers to go away from a quest
[0:35:48] <Aiutare47> Is Pat going to scan every system before side quests send him?
[0:35:51] <dawarw0lf> Yes
[0:35:55] <%Movemeister> Danger, Danger, Pat Boivin
[0:35:56] <Laecerelius> Get them credits!
[0:35:57] <knight_verse> Yep
[0:35:58] <dawarw0lf> Never buy fuel
[0:36:04] <peachy996> BWOOOMMMM
[0:36:05] <Mattais88> @thehark90 At least until Citadel then you can farm that Multiplayer test area
[0:36:07] <tanarath> Systems Alliance being bros if true
[0:36:14] <Yrefe> yep fuel really doesn't matter in this one
[0:36:16] <+Alig200> probably a random fuel depot
[0:36:22] <thehark90> @Mattais88 yes very true
[0:36:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat please I sent you the guide in dono's
[0:36:28] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I used the ME wiki for scanning but it kinda sucked
[0:36:31] <ZeromusPrime93> BASS DROP OF DOOM
[0:36:33] <peachy996> This is fun, isn't it?
[0:36:34] <Profmcstevie> Can you mash scan? Just attract reapers then go crazy?
[0:36:40] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> like it worked but it was unwieldy
[0:36:40] <+RowenCleric> why the reapers always farting
[0:36:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat just BOUNCE
[0:36:47] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat says: “There’s two things I hate in Mass Effect.  Space Racists and Batarians.”
[0:36:49] <peachy996> Isn't this fun
[0:36:49] <stormhawk9891> BWAAAAAAAAHHHHH
[0:36:49] <%TheYellowcouch> Okay this bwoom got real funny real fast
[0:36:54] <%captain_kirkhammer> If it's not on a planet it's just a fuel depot and you can ignore it
[0:36:56] <anAngryHamster> PAT YOU SAID THE STREAM WAS AT FOUR
[0:36:57] <ZeromusPrime93> LEG IT PAT
[0:36:57] <%sniffy77> up ur butt lol
[0:37:00] <KnightOfTrousers> @PatStaresAt Why can't the reapers chasing you just shut down the Relay?...
[0:37:02] <%LumberjackJack> FIRST TRY
[0:37:08] <%AncelDeLambert> .... wow so worth it
[0:37:08] <+akscully> you did it
[0:37:09] <GuyverTypeL> Reaper go BRRRRRRRR
[0:37:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> Isn't this fun Pat? Manual Scanning is awesome!
[0:37:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Just FYI you need like 7,400 War Assets to get the best destroy ending, but around 5.200ish for the second best of any ending
[0:37:11] <+AmericanSkidd> all that for some fuel
[0:37:12] <+Scevda> This is fub
[0:37:15] <mr_saturday93> Someone tell m- AH HA IM A GENIUS
[0:37:16] <xcompleasedad> @KnightOfTrousers They forgot
[0:37:18] <ZeromusPrime93> SeemsGood
[0:37:19] <%Solid_Stro> We’re gonna hear “BWAHHHH!!!!” for awhile
[0:37:31] <Mattais88> If you die to reapers it only restarts you after the last entry
[0:37:34] <GuyverTypeL> aaaare youuu having fun mr kraaaabs?
[0:37:37] <Profmcstevie> Plutus maximus
[0:37:39] <knight_verse> Plutus has only one
[0:37:47] <ChungusQuest> fear the blast of the mighty space tuba
[0:37:47] <Zombrocom> BWAAA
[0:37:47] <tanarath> @knightoftrousers Indoctrination is subtle, they need Shepard alive.
[0:37:48] <peachy996> YAY
[0:37:49] <+D00msDayDan> it's the only way
[0:37:49] <%LumberjackJack> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:37:51] <+AmericanSkidd> AS INTENDED
[0:37:51] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat if you touch where a scannable would be, it will make a slight ding, which is a pain but is one way to investigate without scanning too much
[0:37:55] <%kujofire990> It's not that bad
[0:37:55] <4DLuvOfLuthy> the true experience
[0:38:01] <$Futurecity10> you die
[0:38:02] <ZeromusPrime93> Stop farting into a tuba
[0:38:07] <thehark90> the reapers win
[0:38:08] <Laecerelius> Dunno
[0:38:11] <Mattais88> ...I don't know
[0:38:11] <+akscully> auto go back to the mass effect relay
[0:38:12] <@commanderclaw> It costs money and you call a tow truck IIRC
[0:38:14] <+Alig200> it tows you back to the mass relay system
[0:38:14] <%LumberjackJack> It'd be neat if you could listen to codex while doing these annoying scan moments
[0:38:15] <ZeromusPrime93> wooliePOYO
[0:38:18] <peachy996> You get knocked back into a map with a mass relaty
[0:38:18] <ChungusQuest> game over yeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
[0:38:19] <+D00msDayDan> in ME2 you'd drain your eezo resource
[0:38:21] <dawarw0lf> It returns you to a mass relay
[0:38:21] <Deasmeister> They take your money
[0:38:22] <Profmcstevie> Space tow
[0:38:25] <%jackelzxaa> The reason people hated mass effect 3 wasnt just the ending, it was because of the bad scanning game
[0:38:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> you call a space tow truck, literally
[0:38:29] <blackjack8182> Teleport
[0:38:30] <+akscully> you just auto return to the relay system
[0:38:31] <+Scevda> Fucking nothi no
[0:38:31] <%TheYellowcouch> Man I didn't even get here, I quit after I got tired of my character being cross eyed as fuck for no reason
[0:38:32] <GuyverTypeL> enjoying me together like family famiy family...
[0:38:36] <%jackelzxaa> If you run out of fuel they take you back to the relay automatically
[0:38:36] <ZeromusPrime93> BAD TOUCH
[0:38:39] <Profmcstevie> This REALLY undermines the threat of the Reapers as you giggle and flee
[0:38:42] <$Futurecity10> N
[0:38:43] <peachy996> Oh there's lots of reasons to hate 3
[0:38:45] <Laecerelius> I totally forgot about this scan system
[0:38:45] <$Futurecity10> No
[0:38:47] <OldManDeckardCain> no the actual reason is that mass effect 3 is a shit game
[0:38:51] <$Futurecity10> There's a fuel station
[0:38:52] <DatAsuna> The scan system is fine, ME2's was way worse
[0:38:54] <knight_verse> You need to learn the meta for scanning
[0:38:54] <%saiko2208> Reaper tuba used to be my ringtone and it would scare the shit out of me at night lol
[0:38:55] <+Alig200> yep, its a free refuel, but you have to sit through the docking stuff
[0:39:06] <thehark90> I NEED TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL
[0:39:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> uncontrolled systems should have a fuel depot
[0:39:08] <%Pappajimbo> I always thought a good concept would be a race that exsisted outside the mass relays so would advance far enough ahead to fight the reapers but you need to find a way to reach them.
[0:39:09] <%jackelzxaa> Imagine if you could boop the reapers
[0:39:12] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> this is nice
[0:39:13] <%bread_assassin> Now, how come the game tracks if you got the armor,shield and weapon upgrades from ME2, but not the expanded fuel reserves upgrade.
[0:39:14] <%AncelDeLambert> faaaaaast traaavel
[0:39:15] <%trackles_64> fast travel
[0:39:16] <blackjack8182> Check on Kaidan fish
[0:39:19] <ZeromusPrime93> LOOKIN COOL JOKER
[0:39:20] <+AmericanSkidd> haha you have to get your parking validated
[0:39:25] <+D00msDayDan> i like how it's from the docking official's pov
[0:39:28] <+Scevda> Kaiden vegetable
[0:39:35] <%LumberjackJack> Just spend the few credits at the fuel stations. You're never tight on money unless you want to buy every expensive gun ever
[0:39:36] <Laecerelius> Check out those pepperonis
[0:39:36] <@commanderclaw> Time to go massage Kaiden's nips so he feels better
[0:39:40] <dawarw0lf> Usually theirs enough fuel in systems to not need a refuel
[0:39:41] <+akscully> still jacked
[0:39:45] <+DarkJaguar124> Go see Kaidan's pecks!
[0:39:46] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You will get emails for when to next visit kaiden
[0:39:47] <das_sensentier> He is a great vegetable.
[0:39:48] <peachy996> This game balances annoying, helpful, good and bad
[0:39:49] <%shadowsofpain> check on leg man
[0:39:52] <available_line> Where is Thane?
[0:39:54] <Meekest> Why does the hospital turn everyone into bimbos and himbos
[0:39:55] <Mattais88> Kaiden Sea Cucumber
[0:39:56] <peachy996> It truly is a mixed experience
[0:40:02] <%MidnightBurst12> nips still pristine
[0:40:03] <Profmcstevie> Bro, you look huge Kaiden....get better :D
[0:40:08] <%jackelzxaa> They really write kaiden in me3 like he’s your dorky kid brother
[0:40:10] <ZeromusPrime93> "You dead?". "Ya mon"
[0:40:12] <%LumberjackJack> Shepard running with that stick up his ass
[0:40:13] <thehark90> Make sure to check the map each time you go to an area of the cidital it'lll show new folks you can talk to
[0:40:15] <+Scevda> @available_line that procs after a mission done
[0:40:16] <@commanderclaw> @Meekest A fanfic writer made the Hospital
[0:40:17] <%jackelzxaa> Just dont accidentally kiss him
[0:40:32] <knight_verse> There are ALOT of guns to buy in this game, so save your money.
[0:40:34] <+AmericanSkidd> "Yo Kaiden, nice cock"
[0:40:37] <Halospaz117> Hey, we should make Kaiden feel better by getting James to rub up against him, I'm sure it will work....
[0:40:37] <available_line> @Scevda Neat. I was scared he died.
[0:40:38] <Meekest> @commanderclaw Ahhh
[0:40:41] <%QueequegTheater> @Meekest Because it's based
[0:40:44] <+Scevda> And remember only gay people gift each other alcohol.
[0:40:49] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[0:40:56] <peachy996> Yeah they remember lol
[0:41:01] <+RowenCleric> brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
[0:41:07] <valriot> Reaper doing the Stickbugged meme
[0:41:12] <rekinom> Wow for being the peak of technological superiority those reapers sure are slow and easy to outwit
[0:41:19] <%bread_assassin> It autosaves everytime you enter a zone, so if you trigger the reapers just get caught, since you already know where to scan.
[0:41:19] <%jackelzxaa> You can buy guns soon
[0:41:22] <%Garthunox> Pat why arent you getting the items you've scanned in that system?
[0:41:25] <%Solid_Stro> BRRRRR
[0:41:25] <valriot> Space is really big to be fair
[0:41:27] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Reapers alert status reset after literally any mission. There are more than enough missions that you can come back later
[0:41:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> Is Javik on your list after this scanning?
[0:41:37] <thehark90> How do you like my bbbbbbbrrrzt Shepard?-Harbinger
[0:41:40] <KnightOfTrousers> "We are each a sigma male"
[0:41:45] <%QueequegTheater> The SR-2 is worth more than an entire fleet
[0:41:46] <ZeromusPrime93> I genuinely forgot EVO started today, what the fuck
[0:41:47] <%LumberjackJack> It's really annoying, especially because you have to hear that loud horn every time. Turns something incredibly intimidating into nothing
[0:41:56] <knight_verse> It actually is super fast.
[0:41:58] <%SpcOpsBear> Did you know that they made a Mass Effect themed RISK? It had a dice-based scanning minigame as an optional feature and allowed you to play as the Alliance, the Reapers or as Cerberus, each of which had different objectives to win.
[0:42:02] <+Scevda> @knightoftrousers lol
[0:42:03] <valriot> A Reaper finding you in a GALAXY is more ridiculous
[0:42:11] <Laecerelius> They almost got yer butt
[0:42:11] <Profmcstevie> Sovereign will never be outdone in coolness, these reapers chasing you are hilarious
[0:42:13] <das_sensentier> Had that reaper sound as my alarm clock sound for a while.
[0:42:18] <%Garthunox> but you can just ignore that stupid handicap the force on you
[0:42:18] <+RAWPowerStudios> What happens if they catch you?
[0:42:20] <+Scevda> @lumberjackjack true
[0:42:20] <+RowenCleric> what happens if they get you, dont think I ever got caught
[0:42:23] <+AmericanSkidd> Apparently they hate keeping the stealth on during scanning
[0:42:24] <RaidenRising> brrrrrm
[0:42:26] <%sniffy77> shooooooow me the asset!
[0:42:29] <%LumberjackJack> SCAN MORE, PAT
[0:42:35] <dekkitout> Back dat asset up
[0:42:36] <peachy996> So yeah I don't agree that this is better than 2's scanning
[0:42:38] <%LumberjackJack> SCAN HARDER
[0:42:39] <@commanderclaw> The hypest gameplay on Twitch
[0:42:41] <+Scevda> @spcopsbear i remember that!
[0:42:44] <Profmcstevie> Like fade to black game over
[0:42:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat just WAIT until you have the damn UPGRADE

[0:43:01] <xcompleasedad> BLIND
[0:43:02] <DatAsuna> @valriot they only appear in systems they were already in though, it's not like they searched the whole galaxy for you
[0:43:03] <Theo_Marks> this thrid person shooter is THRILLING
[0:43:04] <peachy996> Because while 2 can be very tedious you don't hear BWOOOOOMMMM all the time like this

[0:43:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You got it like two minutes into the runnaround.
[0:43:15] <+Scevda> PEACH LEVEL BLIND
[0:43:16] <%saiko2208> They are sending the dork reapers to chase you lol
[0:43:18] <knight_verse> Six set of eyes.
[0:43:20] <%Solid_Stro> The biggest Blind
[0:43:21] <GustauveVIII> Planetless assets are almost 99% of the time fuel
[0:43:22] <+kortin> I thought that said Fartina
[0:43:26] <thehark90> the war assets in the middle of space are always fuel the ones on the planets are actal assets
[0:43:31] <stormhawk9891> BOY IS IT
[0:43:35] <SaltyAzteca> HE SUN THE SUN THE SUN T
[0:43:37] <Profmcstevie> It's been terrible since ME2 Pat you modded it to be tolerable
[0:43:45] <@commanderclaw> Dis nutz
[0:43:46] <Deasmeister> Still better than in 2 imo but it is terrible
[0:43:54] <DatAsuna> ME2 unmodded was worse yeah
[0:43:55] <%TheYellowcouch> I have a feeling ME3 is gonna last a lot longer than ME2
[0:43:55] <GuyverTypeL> Dis nuts lol
[0:44:08] <kjb343> and that's why you get the scan mod
[0:44:15] <peachy996> You won't game over from no fuel
[0:44:15] <dawarw0lf> @theyellowcouch Both base game and dlc is longer then last games
[0:44:23] <peachy996> You'll just kicked back to the main system
[0:44:24] <+toastybites> something something Metallica
[0:44:26] <+Scevda> 2’s scanning had its place. This is just irritating
[0:44:30] <thehark90> @TheYellowcouch a lot of stuff to scan and do to 100% it
[0:44:34] <blackjack8182> At least in 2, you get to land on the occasional scanned planet.
[0:44:34] <Aiutare47> It’s almost always fuel. You’re may be better off just scanning when a side quest asks.
[0:44:37] <DatAsuna> It's good to do at least 1 stream without the mod so you know what you're modding out
[0:44:38] <Coystick> SPACE FARTS
[0:44:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah that's the best idea.
[0:44:47] <%sniffy77> yeah that kewl
[0:44:51] <peachy996> It broke the music
[0:44:52] <%JohnAtDawn> PROTHEAN FIRST
[0:44:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Now go get Javik.
[0:44:56] <%TheYellowcouch> This chase mechanic isn't helping the play time that's for sure
[0:44:57] <karl_rex> That sounds awful
[0:45:01] <@commanderclaw> Do Javik First, he's great
[0:45:04] <+AmericanSkidd> we love it
[0:45:06] <DatAsuna> @Aiutare47 you would, but OCD
[0:45:07] <peachy996> The reapers broke the fucking music
[0:45:07] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait, is that where Jeddek is? I dont remember
[0:45:08] <$Futurecity10> I would get the prothean first
[0:45:08] <dawarw0lf> Wait to get javik
[0:45:10] <+Scevda> Scraping is easy ya
[0:45:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> Get Javik right now.
[0:45:12] <%Deano8817> Yeah I'm having a great ti-BWWWAAAAAH
[0:45:14] <arkv01> I am, thanks VoHiYo

[0:45:26] <%Garthunox> GUYS YOU CANT BRING JAVIK TO PALAVEN SO IT DOESNT MATTER
[0:45:29] <%LumberjackJack> Gimme?
[0:45:32] <dawarw0lf> @commanderclaw He won’t be Available until after next mission
[0:45:34] <peachy996> That's a huge bitch
[0:45:35] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There will never be reapers in a system with main missions.
[0:45:42] <@commanderclaw> @dawarw0lf Ah, okay
[0:45:45] <dawarw0lf> There is actually
[0:45:45] <KeystoneA2> You didn't scan Gemmae though
[0:45:46] <GuyverTypeL> gimme gimme fire gimme ghvfddssf
[0:45:51] <+akscully> you don't
[0:45:51] <dawarw0lf> Just a bunch of fuel
[0:45:52] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> h
[0:45:53] <thewrathofscience> @Coystick Harbinger: You're out of Febreeze Shepard
[0:45:56] <Javier9563> there's a fuel depot right there
[0:45:58] <%ahomeschooldropout> You can't use Javik until after Palavan anyways
[0:45:59] <%jackelzxaa> Sometimes it hides the percentage marker
[0:46:01] <Halospaz117> pat, it's fine
[0:46:02] <peachy996> Yeppp
[0:46:03] <RushUnplugged> you can refuel on Depots on main systems
[0:46:03] <DatAsuna> there was a fuel station right there
[0:46:04] <dawarw0lf> The place your at had like 1000
[0:46:04] <%LumberjackJack> NotLikeThis
[0:46:06] <@commanderclaw> Oh no
[0:46:08] <dekkitout> Just casually flying through a star- nbd
[0:46:11] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt Gemmae has all the Turian fleet's fuel.
[0:46:11] <Deasmeister> Fuel is cheap as shit
[0:46:12] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt In the Apien crest there are assets in Castellus and Gemmae
[0:46:15] <+alphonseisbest> just got here did I miss much?
[0:46:17] <%AJ_Cherenkov> oh god
[0:46:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> No it's not.
[0:46:20] <dawarw0lf> There was fuel in the system you left
[0:46:21] <karl_rex> Fuel is cheap
[0:46:22] <RushUnplugged> it's like 1k credits for a full tank
[0:46:22] <Profmcstevie> We cheat money into these don't we
[0:46:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's like 1K.
[0:46:23] <%hatok> the cost is negligable and you'll have plenty of money
[0:46:23] <%LumberjackJack> Pat's like the person at grocery store line using 5 coupons to save $2
[0:46:24] <%SpcOpsBear> GIMME FUEL GIMME FIRE GIMME a better fucking minigame
[0:46:29] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[0:46:29] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 46m 49s.
[0:46:34] <KnightOfTrousers> Did Samara's fuel upgrades carry over?
[0:46:35] <%jackelzxaa> It never shows you the 0% scans pat you only get it if you’ve revealed at least one thing.  Almost every system has assets
[0:46:36] <+alphonseisbest> NICE
[0:46:42] <+Scevda> CREDITS FOR THE CREDITS GOD. RULES OF ACQUISITION
[0:46:45] <@commanderclaw> It's sipsipGasm !
[0:46:51] <SilverFaustX> hi paige
[0:47:04] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Cause I'll just @ you
[0:47:11] <%hatok> the citadel DLC has an arena where you can get infinite credits don't worry about money
[0:47:12] <dawarw0lf> @jackelzxaa The system he left has two big things of fuel
[0:47:15] <Profmcstevie> Mash scan and pray
[0:47:17] <+Scevda> @knightoftrousers it does not
[0:47:20] <+Ches_Neckbeard> you'd know it with a guide Pat
[0:47:23] <+unhuggable1> thats annoying
[0:47:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> isnt there a thing you get at some point that shows you the percentage?
[0:47:29] <Saffry_Ruzin> @La
[0:47:32] <+alphonseisbest> btw for anyone in ff14 right now: On Jenova there a SHB hunt train in 20min
[0:47:33] <dawarw0lf> @hatok But that’s one of the last things hell do
[0:47:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> like towards end-game?
[0:47:37] <%LumberjackJack> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:47:40] <peachy996> Palaven is turbo FUCKED
[0:47:47] <dawarw0lf> Who can it be?
[0:47:47] <+AmericanSkidd> its a mystery
[0:47:48] <%Garthunox> omg its like 1000 credits at most
[0:47:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> BROJOB BROJOB
[0:47:50] <%Baby_Hotpockets_> None at all
[0:47:52] <peachy996> It looks like Earth from Doom Eternal
[0:47:53] <4DLuvOfLuthy> cant imagine any reason at all~
[0:47:53] <thehark90> I'm sure the Turians are doing just fine
[0:47:54] <dawarw0lf> I WONDER
[0:47:54] <Coystick> To visit Wrex?
[0:47:56] <Laecerelius> Wonder who's gonna be there!
[0:48:03] <Javier9563> you can get infinite credits in the armax arena anyway
[0:48:11] <Profmcstevie> New boyfriend and old girlfriend, what a team
[0:48:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Garthunox Yeah but that's 1K credit's you won't have for the fancy guns.
[0:48:21] <@commanderclaw> Can't you equip multiple guns? IDK, it's been a decade for me
[0:48:24] <karl_rex> You can modify your teamates guns
[0:48:24] <%ForlornCarton> Mods?
[0:48:25] <+AmericanSkidd> Jacob is probably there
[0:48:30] <%LumberjackJack> Any mods for the weapons yet? Or still too early?
[0:48:30] <+akscully> any mods for the guns yet?
[0:48:33] <+alphonseisbest> TIME FOR DBZ VANGARD SHEPARD
[0:48:36] <Mattais88> No weight capacity on squadies, so give everyone the Big guns
[0:48:43] <Coystick> Bane?
[0:48:46] <Laecerelius> You can but more guns = more weight which means slower power cooldowns
[0:48:51] <dawarw0lf> Thank god the scanning is over. While fine on its own when I do it watching  it was terrible
[0:48:55] <Deasmeister> How does open mask work in space??
[0:48:57] <blackjack8182> I think you can find 2 weapons here.
[0:48:58] <KnightOfTrousers> I love how Liara's helmet doesn't protect her from the fucking VACCUUM
[0:49:04] <tronhd> before javik came out my friend referred to James as Baby Krogan
[0:49:04] <%TheYellowcouch> thank fuck their eyeballs are resistant to... the vacuum of space?
[0:49:11] <KeystoneA2> @Coystick Why does she wear the mask?
[0:49:17] <das_sensentier> Yeah the ships look great
[0:49:22] <+DarkJaguar124> If he keeps the helmet on, he's not that bad.
[0:49:25] <peachy996> Look at how fucked that planet is
[0:49:25] <@commanderclaw> YEP
[0:49:25] <%LumberjackJack> Just shoot at the planet, no biggie
[0:49:27] <%king_wragles> Pillar of Autumn is a great design imo
[0:49:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> YEP
[0:49:28] <das_sensentier> Sure is
[0:49:28] <stormhawk9891> ye
[0:49:28] <+AmericanSkidd> yup
[0:49:29] <peachy996> YEAH
[0:49:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah
[0:49:30] <+Alig200> yep, its fucked
[0:49:31] <available_line> Looks REAPED
[0:49:31] <+akscully> yes
[0:49:31] <%Deano8817> yeah they're kinda fucked
[0:49:31] <Profmcstevie> Remind me of Feisar from Wipeout games
[0:49:32] <%SpcOpsBear> No, it's just the moon
[0:49:32] <4DLuvOfLuthy> yep its rip
[0:49:32] <%MidnightBurst12> ye
[0:49:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's super fucked.
[0:49:33] <%TheYellowcouch> I like how it very clearly looks like the normandy just square
[0:49:34] <valriot> DUDE, SHIT IS ROUGH
[0:49:35] <tanarath> YES
[0:49:36] <GuyverTypeL> pew pew pew
[0:49:37] <%SpcOpsBear> ...or is it, I dunno
[0:49:38] <%Movemeister> Liara’s breast get bigger in each sequel
[0:49:38] <dekkitout> Was- it was
[0:49:40] <%RonaldMcDownload> Not once they're dead
[0:49:40] <xcompleasedad> YES
[0:49:41] <dawarw0lf> It’s fucked
[0:49:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> Those are city lights, not fire
[0:49:47] <%Torus1025> Yuuuuuup
[0:49:50] <tanarath> @king_wragles It is great
[0:49:51] <xcompleasedad> They are JUST as fucked as Earth
[0:49:51] <%sniffy77> Pat the galaxy if FUCKED
[0:49:52] <%NocturneNovember> Shit's on fire yo
[0:49:53] <Profmcstevie> It's fire
[0:49:54] <dawarw0lf> Which is why the humans asking for support is dumb
[0:49:55] <+alphonseisbest> Its burning
[0:49:58] <Laecerelius> They're getting as fucked as we are
[0:50:00] <+Goraka91> Shit's fucked yo
[0:50:04] <%miguelrod777> everything fucked
[0:50:07] <%Mr_Pylon> even their moon is on fire
[0:50:08] <peachy996> Your mission is on its moon, that's how fucked it is
[0:50:08] <dawarw0lf> NO BUT EARTH THI
[0:50:09] <KeystoneA2> Literally everywhere is on fire.
[0:50:09] <RushUnplugged> Palaven is UBER fucked
[0:50:10] <DatAsuna> the salarians and asari aren't as fucked as the turians
[0:50:10] <thehark90> I'M SURE PALAVEN IS FINE
[0:50:12] <%king_wragles> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, it doesn't look THAT different than normal but it IS fucked
[0:50:12] <+AmericanSkidd> it looks worse than it is, I hope
[0:50:13] <%LumberjackJack> No, it's fire
[0:50:13] <tanarath> YEAH NO PAT, MAYBE THEY'RE FACING THIS SHIT TOO
[0:50:14] <Profmcstevie> Oh they're attacking EVERYWHERE everywhere
[0:50:15] <Zombrocom> Everything is fucked
[0:50:17] <%somekindofsam> most of this game is doom and gloom
[0:50:18] <%UvBenServed> Cause of the """reapers"""
[0:50:21] <%captain_kirkhammer> The Turian councillor is actually being absurdly generous
[0:50:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, that's why I personally am not too beat up about that.
[0:50:26] <GuilKato> only just joined stream - where is the Javvick?
[0:50:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> was the framerate of that cutscene a little choppy on your end Pat?
[0:50:31] <stantheman_97> all the homeworlds are being targeted first so everyone is ultra mega fucked
[0:50:35] <%Torus1025> That's right, No more Palace
[0:50:38] <+YabbaTroll> haha the roman inspired aliens are getting decimated
[0:50:39] <blackjack8182> James alt armor looks so cool.
[0:50:40] <+alphonseisbest> Nah its only Pallavan like this Pat
[0:50:44] <%Torus1025> *Palave n
[0:50:50] <peachy996> We will get a peak of Palaven near the end
[0:50:54] <+Scevda> Read the palaven codex/starmap entries. Its pretty dope
[0:50:55] <+Goraka91> SourPls
[0:50:57] <KnightOfTrousers> RAIL SHOOTER YEEEEEAH
[0:51:03] <Protologo> open that shit up!
[0:51:04] <peachy996> Thanks to Bioware adding scenes in
[0:51:05] <KnightOfTrousers> Oh nvm
[0:51:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> TURRET SECTIONS
[0:51:09] <blackjack8182> Lame
[0:51:10] <+unhuggable1> this is cool
[0:51:13] <@commanderclaw> For all this game's faults, it really sells the "Everthing is fucked, this is the war to end all wars" vibe
[0:51:13] <Profmcstevie> Swarmed? By husks? They fall over to a fart
[0:51:15] <%sniffy77> just like banging
[0:51:16] <%TheYellowcouch> this kinda reminds me of ground zeros, just more action
[0:51:16] <dawarw0lf> @blackjack8182 I wish he and Kaiden didn’t share it. One of them should have something different
[0:51:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's not fire, it's city lights guys. Widespread fires wouldn't web out like that and the smoke would obscure the smaller fires
[0:51:19] <thehark90> Call of duty Mass effect coming up!
[0:51:20] <%king_wragles> It's a rock planet
[0:51:21] <stantheman_97> WAR
[0:51:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Big thing to understand though, only Pallavan is getting this messed up. All the other council planets don't have anything wrong with them.
[0:51:22] <%MidnightBurst12> shit's fucked
[0:51:24] <%Movemeister> People moving out, people moving in
[0:51:24] <%greasypete00> big bad news
[0:51:24] <+akscully> it's not great, bob!
[0:51:27] <Halospaz117> AND THIS IS JUST THE MOON
[0:51:29] <Jaysky> Sure is
[0:51:29] <Daskolin> Hits fucked
[0:51:30] <peachy996> Menae is a nice MP Map
[0:51:31] <%LumberjackJack> Yup. Lots of missions are gonna have this oppressing feeling
[0:51:32] <DatAsuna> husks on the moon
[0:51:34] <ChungusQuest> I wonder how many Turian military vets are getting their First Contact War PTSD triggered by all these husks invading.
[0:51:40] <Coystick> I love that the walking Reapers give you that War of the Worlds Tripod imagery
[0:51:42] <valriot> YEP
[0:51:43] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah its bad
[0:51:43] <+CyanDeadEye> Just imagine if any of the Reapers realized Shepard was present in the system.
[0:51:45] <Mattais88> TurboFucked
[0:51:50] <+Scevda> WHY
[0:51:52] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[0:51:58] <%TheYellowcouch> Gotta give it to me3 they made a bunch of fantastic skyboxes
[0:51:59] <+Rikufmix21> moons haunted
[0:52:01] <blackjack8182> @dawarw0lf Agreed.
[0:52:04] <%capnbeefs> Man, this is FUBAR
[0:52:06] <Yrefe> is he nova-charging yet?
[0:52:12] <+critikal_bit> Nobody is having a good time...except for the Reapers I guess
[0:52:12] <xcompleasedad> @CyanDeadEye Harbinger would be busting the FATTEST nuts
[0:52:13] <DatAsuna> @CyanDeadEye Imagine if that reaper that killed the kid on earth had just looked to his left and seen the normandy lol
[0:52:18] <%MidnightBurst12> no helmet on that guy?
[0:52:24] <+Scevda> He just used a med pack why?!
[0:52:28] <knight_verse> And yet they don't have it as bad as Earth.
[0:52:35] <available_line> Those are not city lights. That's a fire the size of California.
[0:52:36] <peachy996> The Skyboxes have always been good in the series, it was nice ME3 didn't change that
[0:52:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> Man, I so wanna play Mass Effect 3 again, but I don't wanna play ME1
[0:52:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Scevda No he picked something up.
[0:52:43] <valriot> Theyre so good
[0:52:43] <Jaysky> Egg an really dud a number on this place
[0:52:46] <+Goraka91> I don't like how they all look the same in 3 when 2 had a crazy variety
[0:52:49] <DatAsuna> These are just the 2 bozos that got relegated to moon duty
[0:52:50] <Jaysky> *Eggman
[0:52:50] <Laecerelius> Seeing them walk around makes their design make more sense
[0:52:55] <%capnbeefs> MS3 is pretty fucking rad
[0:52:57] <%LumberjackJack> Just shoot it 4Head
[0:53:09] <DianaTheAscian> @DatAsuna LUL
[0:53:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> @available_line THAT was a fire, but the orange lights when the Normandy entered the system were city lights
[0:53:12] <+Scevda> What just happend?
[0:53:13] <peachy996> I wanna play the MP again but dusting off my PS3 is too much work for my lazy ass
[0:53:25] <Jaysky> @leiaskynoober My same thoughts.
[0:53:27] <DatAsuna> @LeiaSkynoober you could just play 3 then? lol Starting a fresh save gets you some interesting different dialogue
[0:53:30] <+Goraka91> 3 is a fun game, it just borks things like side quests and the ending
[0:53:34] <Mattais88> I think the opening arc of ME3 is my favourite part outside of teh Citadel
[0:53:38] <GuyverTypeL> ME3 looks really good for a old game holy fuck
[0:53:50] <dawarw0lf> I know I said it last stream but still fuck that one guy in particular that said 3 didn’t do the “war is and it’s hopeless” feeling. What were they smoking
[0:53:53] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 the old PC version still works, and you can cheatengine yourself infinite mp credits lol
[0:54:08] <%capnbeefs> The remaster is pretty solid I  will give them that
[0:54:10] <+alphonseisbest> @GuyverTypeL it did not used to look like this, these are updated graphics
[0:54:17] <peachy996> @DatAsuna I'm a console plebian lol
[0:54:18] <+Goraka91> Also the Multiplayer not being in the remaster is a crime
[0:54:34] <Jaysky> ME3 is definitely "everything is going to fuck" the game
[0:54:40] <DatAsuna> @GuyverTypeL the updates are very minimal and some would argue worse, mostly just shit like adding a bad vignette effect to everything
[0:54:46] <thehark90> @Goraka91 dont worry EA will add it in for only $9.99!
[0:54:48] <+Scevda> Hope everything is okay on pats end
[0:55:02] <peachy996> Palaven is the start of the Tuchanka Arc and it's still my favorite part of the game's story
[0:55:02] <Aiutare47> @goraka91 some people theorize the removal of some files including Dennvo means they’re going to add in an MP mode.
[0:55:17] <%greasypete00> LUL
[0:55:19] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god
[0:55:20] <SilverFaustX> lol
[0:55:20] <+AmericanSkidd> cool
[0:55:21] <Laecerelius> Wombo combo!
[0:55:21] <tanarath> Yeah!
[0:55:22] <Jaysky> nice
[0:55:22] <@commanderclaw> Zoo Keeper Pat doing his job
[0:55:23] <peachy996> Ah the 1-2 Combo
[0:55:24] <%Tman451> ANIMAL HOUSE!!
[0:55:24] <%AncelDeLambert> MASS HYSTERIA
[0:55:24] <%king_wragles> Aren't pets just the best?
[0:55:24] <4DLuvOfLuthy> CHAOS
[0:55:25] <OldManDeckardCain> so just the usual day for pat LUL
[0:55:25] <%TheYellowcouch> Double wammy
[0:55:26] <dawarw0lf> I LOVE cad vomit
[0:55:28] <%jackelzxaa> Remember: the Turian Military is about 60x the size of the entire alliance fleet and they’re getting spanked by the reapers like they were nothing.  Conventional victory was always out the window
[0:55:30] <ChungusQuest> it's a fluid circus
[0:55:30] <dekkitout> Trouble coming out of both ends
[0:55:30] <%MidnightBurst12> psaWink
[0:55:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Classic
[0:55:31] <+s0lesurviv0r> kids, amirite?
[0:55:32] <thehark90> A typical Saturday
[0:55:32] <Profmcstevie> Cat vomit? That's what Zangief is for!
[0:55:33] <dawarw0lf> They never stop
[0:55:40] <Aiutare47> What a card
[0:55:40] <GuyverTypeL> is elmo okay tho? is that normal?
[0:55:43] <dawarw0lf> I have 3 cats
[0:55:43] <mr_saturday93> Is Elmo ok?
[0:55:47] <%TheYellowcouch> Just your average Zoo keeper duties
[0:55:48] <DatAsuna> If they do bring MP back I hope it's still client side hackable lol
[0:55:50] <+Scevda> I feel that those two things are connected
[0:55:51] <dawarw0lf> Their annoying
[0:55:54] <+CyanDeadEye> Fires
[0:55:54] <+AmericanSkidd> both
[0:55:55] <@commanderclaw> It's both, some fire some lights
[0:55:55] <Laecerelius> Some seem to be huge fires
[0:55:58] <%Solid_Stro> psaWink doodBarf
[0:55:58] <+YabbaTroll> bit of both
[0:55:59] <DatAsuna> it's both
[0:55:59] <dekkitout> Both
[0:56:00] <+MrATheGreat> nah man thats fire
[0:56:00] <RushUnplugged> both
[0:56:00] <peachy996> That planet is on fire
[0:56:00] <%king_wragles> That is a fire, to the right are the city lights
[0:56:00] <4DLuvOfLuthy> Its fire
[0:56:01] <Jaysky> WOOOMP
[0:56:01] <Coystick> Them glassing lights
[0:56:02] <%TheYellowcouch> I think it's pretty clear
[0:56:02] <DianaTheAscian> another day in the zoo
[0:56:03] <%cvp5127> the latter
[0:56:04] <Profmcstevie> Both
[0:56:04] <Laecerelius> That big orange blotch looks like fire
[0:56:05] <%Mr_Pylon> there were big explosions in the orbit shot
[0:56:05] <samcast1> both
[0:56:05] <+akscully> cities on fire!
[0:56:06] <%kujofire990> those are fires
[0:56:06] <thehark90> that big one looks like a flames
[0:56:07] <tanarath> FIRESTORM
[0:56:08] <Zombrocom> Both
[0:56:08] <RushUnplugged> flames IN the cities
[0:56:08] <+alphonseisbest> Both
[0:56:09] <+MrATheGreat> they scarred the planet
[0:56:09] <%jackelzxaa> I think the alliance has 8 dreadnaughts and the turians have 46
[0:56:10] <KnightOfTrousers> Bofum
[0:56:10] <+AmericanSkidd> that big one for sure is fire
[0:56:10] <RayCSmooth> It's shitty lights
[0:56:10] <Saffry_Ruzin> I finished the Trilogy playing Soldier because I thought few people picked it, was pretty cool actually, felt like being Max Payne in 2
[0:56:11] <tronhd> both
[0:56:14] <+alphonseisbest> both
[0:56:15] <thewrathofscience> look at that shitty jpeg
[0:56:16] <+Scevda> Thats a firestorm
[0:56:16] <OldManDeckardCain> it looks like south america
[0:56:17] <xcompleasedad> THAT IS A FIRE BIGGER THAN FUCKING CANADA
[0:56:18] <%cvp5127> yes
[0:56:19] <dekkitout> That's BC
[0:56:19] <Jaysky> The reaper noises are fucking A+
[0:56:21] <+Scevda> Garrus will tell ya
[0:56:24] <%TheYellowcouch> aw they had a killer gender reaveal party there
[0:56:25] <%Movemeister> Both
[0:56:25] <%Torus1025> The cities are on fire
[0:56:28] <Jaysky> BWOOOMP
[0:56:29] <valriot> Its getting glassed essentially
[0:56:29] <%jackelzxaa> And one dreadnaught + fleet can MAYBE take out a single reaper
[0:56:33] <$ItsRatman> U.S. State? We talking RI sized or Texas sized
[0:56:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> THOSE are fires. I was saying the orange lights when the Normandy *entered the system* were city lights.
[0:56:39] <dawarw0lf> A lot of stuff to miss here
[0:56:41] <Ekaelis> That's a lot of roasted dextro lizard
[0:56:42] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt thats California Pat
[0:56:42] <HyperionXV> Hello folks. VoHiYo
[0:56:48] <Mattais88> Lots of upgrades here
[0:56:48] <%jackelzxaa> You would need 100 entire milky way galaxies to beat the reapers
[0:56:49] <%LumberjackJack> Kiss his stupid, leathery, bird mouth
[0:56:49] <RushUnplugged> they mention later that Reapers focus on major city centers first so those are all major cities on fire
[0:56:51] <+AmericanSkidd> he will love it
[0:56:51] <xcompleasedad> @ItsRatman Texas. Easy
[0:56:52] <rekinom> You're going to kiss him in the cloaca?
[0:56:53] <Kat_k> yeah, remember sir isaac newton? the reapers put their back to the planet for a reason
[0:56:55] <DatAsuna> @jackelzxaa Or 3 battleships, but you expect to lose 2, and only if they can pull off a flank
[0:56:57] <Halospaz117> ESPECIALLY in the bird parts
[0:57:07] <+Scevda> Jacob went all out on the child gender reveal party.
[0:57:08] <peachy996> You know what's curious? Garrus is the only squadmate where you won't get a replacement member
[0:57:14] <Jane_Lo> still a shame they didn't allowed to smooch garrus as mshep in this edition
[0:57:15] <peachy996> If he dies in 2
[0:57:18] <@commanderclaw> I like tanky bois
[0:57:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Thicc
[0:57:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> Health and Shield is fine, but Melee damage is good.
[0:57:31] <blackjack8182> Search for items
[0:57:33] <%barrakuta371> but Pat the Dextro Protein will kill you
[0:57:33] <%jackelzxaa> @datasuna It’s basically a total pyric victory for EVERY battle yeah
[0:57:33] <Laecerelius> More shields also mean more Nova damage I think
[0:57:38] <+Scevda> Health
[0:57:40] <notsoy> does boosting shields improve nova damage?
[0:57:42] <DatAsuna> If garrus is dead, James takes his place in this mission and mostly asks expositional questions for Liara to tell you about turians
[0:57:42] <%MidnightBurst12> the thiccest of fighting
[0:57:44] <%Torus1025> Melee is dope
[0:57:46] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 Tail too but she does get a character replacement
[0:57:46] <+MrATheGreat> wait charge recharge rate?
[0:57:49] <+Scevda> @laecerelius yes
[0:57:50] <Laecerelius> I thought it did
[0:57:55] <Laecerelius> Since it uses your shields
[0:58:13] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf yeh you get Daro'Xen
[0:58:13] <%LumberjackJack> Semi-auto sniper
[0:58:14] <+Scevda> Your swuad mates?
[0:58:16] <%jackelzxaa> Theres some interesting character swaps for dead squadmates and some that are kinda meh
[0:58:16] <+AmericanSkidd> That's a fine gun
[0:58:17] <dawarw0lf> Snipers are always heavy as shit
[0:58:25] <DatAsuna> I like the viper, nice and reliable semi auto snipey boi
[0:58:27] <%TheYellowcouch> a lightper rifle
[0:58:30] <peachy996> The Viper is good
[0:58:41] <dawarw0lf> You’re a vanguard pat!
[0:58:42] <%DeadManProp> DeadManProp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hi, hello, hola!
[0:58:44] <+Scevda> Semi auto
[0:58:44] <RushUnplugged> avenger can easily be all you need
[0:58:54] <%capnbeefs> Turians are units
[0:58:57] <dawarw0lf> Sniper has a damage debuff if your not scoped
[0:58:58] <Aiutare47> And it’s level 1, guns get lighter as you level them up.
[0:59:01] <+alphonseisbest> check their feets
[0:59:02] <+AmericanSkidd> they've always been huge
[0:59:06] <anAngryHamster> More to kiss
[0:59:06] <Jaysky> To be fair you're slouching
[0:59:07] <karl_rex> Shepard is just hunched by aiming his gun
[0:59:07] <Saffry_Ruzin> Salarians in Andromeda are fucking giant for no reason
[0:59:10] <+Scevda> Always have been
[0:59:15] <%TheYellowcouch> wonder if we'll meet a friend here
[0:59:22] <DatAsuna> gee I wonder if you'll end up doing both those guys' jobs for them
[0:59:27] <+MrATheGreat> DEADS
[0:59:27] <peachy996> @Saffry_Ruzin They are so fuggin tall yeah lol

[0:59:33] <+YabbaTroll> bruh I thought that growling was a reaper or something
[0:59:35] <dekkitout> Womp womp
[0:59:36] <+Scevda> @datasuna lol
[0:59:37] <%greasypete00> guess well leave then bye
[0:59:42] <%strakillias> Kill the fedora turian
[0:59:46] <+MrATheGreat> JUST 400?!
[0:59:50] <thehark90> shep screwed up by scanning while the Primarch died
[0:59:52] <Sigma_190_Beta> You're gonna flank a spaceship?
[1:00:00] <DatAsuna> It's not irrelevant if you're a capital ship
[1:00:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> With ground troops?
[1:00:07] <DatAsuna> But infantry can't do shit yeah
[1:00:07] <Laecerelius> Who is this voice actor?  He sounds familiar.
[1:00:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> This Turian has Movie Trailer Guy voice.
[1:00:20] <%jackelzxaa> Soverign meant it when he said you were insignificant
[1:00:23] <macathelo> Thats a alien or ur dog?
[1:00:26] <mr_saturday93> Gief sounds so hungry
[1:00:26] <%TheYellowcouch> Gief is a very loud boy today <
[1:00:27] <%Larry_Q> is that optimus?
[1:00:36] <%jackelzxaa> You are literally ants against a us military
[1:00:37] <+Scevda> @macathelo both
[1:00:41] <Laecerelius> I was also thinking Optimus
[1:00:41] <+AmericanSkidd> Line of Succession is fucked
[1:00:51] <+Goraka91> It's not that council guy in XCOM is it?
[1:00:55] <generalve> LUL
[1:00:56] <peachy996> He pant
[1:00:58] <tanarath> Big pant
[1:01:02] <mr_saturday93> Dog ASMR
[1:01:06] <CureMode_> fuck yeah team america
[1:01:09] <%CalderGaming> i like how at this point the turian military has no doubts that shepard can do this
[1:01:12] <%LumberjackJack> Love the helmet just popping in and out of existence so we can see the glorious baldness in cutscenes
[1:01:13] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:01:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @Goraka91 same voice efffect
[1:01:14] <%CalderGaming> because they shouldn't
[1:01:15] <Mattais88> Gief asserting his dominece
[1:01:17] <+Scevda> @goraka91 hmmmmm, that might be it
[1:01:18] <SilverFaustX> gief on the cat tower?
[1:01:21] <%TheYellowcouch> just get stronger
[1:01:21] <Srthunda> where is he, on the ceiling?
[1:01:22] <dekkitout> His love is too massive
[1:01:23] <+Chaos_Aether> Geif Wants Love
[1:01:23] <Saffry_Ruzin> If playable Turians miraculously come in 4, I want mine to sound like that guy
[1:01:29] <+AmericanSkidd> whata potato
[1:01:29] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:01:31] <dawarw0lf> Peter Giles does the voice
[1:01:34] <%SpeedWagonFDN> SpeedWagonFDN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:01:34] <SilverFaustX> paige in danger
[1:01:36] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:01:39] <+Scevda> Gief wants dog dicks
[1:01:41] <%Movemeister> Zangief only gets down on the dance floor
[1:01:42] <peachy996> @CalderGaming Considering the state of their planet they will accept any help
[1:01:44] <Laecerelius> Man if they make playable aliens in 4 then I'll get it just for that
[1:01:45] <%JamesCorck> Man, I miss the multiplayer of this game so badly.
[1:01:47] <%TheYellowcouch> I mean technically Paige...
[1:01:48] <Coystick> BurgerSaliva
[1:01:49] <%TheYellowcouch> you are
[1:01:50] <viewtifulr> Gief trying to preform a GRAPPLE
[1:01:51] <%Arancet> i like how turians are a war race that aren't obsessed with getting themselves killed and glorify it
[1:01:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> My Mom had a great dane that was a total lapdog, so imagine like a 200lb lap dog
[1:01:53] <%Movemeister> LUL
[1:01:55] <dekkitout> That boi is sinisterly affectionate
[1:01:56] <peachy996> And that plays out later in the story
[1:01:56] <tanarath> Mother P L E A S E
[1:02:00] <Profmcstevie> You have zero control over that dog, very funny
[1:02:01] <%JamesCorck> Sure, it was a simple hoard mode, but it was such a good hoard mode, holyshit.
[1:02:01] <mr_saturday93> He probably confuses her bewbs as meaty (which they kinda are but)
[1:02:04] <Saffry_Ruzin> I'd probably play either a Quarian or Krogan
[1:02:13] <karl_rex> Lots of upgrades here
[1:02:16] <DianaTheAscian> oh no
[1:02:21] <+Scevda> Gief thinks hes on the same level of the pack as paige lol.
[1:02:29] <+Goraka91> @Arancet I've seen it put that they're a proud SOLDIER race, not warrior barbarians
[1:02:36] <peachy996> I would recommend having a big chunky weapon
[1:02:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's 5% less power though.
[1:02:38] <%JamesCorck> I say playing as a Hannar would be sick.
[1:02:41] <Laecerelius> Seems good since you're not using it often anyway
[1:02:42] <dawarw0lf> Be aware Pat that non scoped snipers do less damage
[1:02:49] <+AmericanSkidd> It would be better to start cremating all KIA's
[1:02:54] <%LumberjackJack> TRYING NEW THINGS OUT? WHERE IS THE REAL PAT?
[1:02:55] <%JamesCorck> Go around with three guns on your tentacles, shooting all the fools.
[1:02:56] <peachy996> About that...
[1:03:00] <+akscully> there are no far away problems with a vanguard
[1:03:06] <viewtifulr> do you think Gief thinks 'Im better because I get hand fed treats'
[1:03:07] <%unstablebeast19> the black widow is busted in this game once you're able to afford it
[1:03:09] <peachy996> I don't want to spoil though. Nevermind
[1:03:10] <%Arancet> @Goraka91 i'd say thats right
[1:03:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> @jamescorck  Very unlikely, but I'd do it too just for the uniqueness
[1:03:22] <+Scevda> I find  the idea playing hanar and volus boring. Elcor on the other hand.
[1:03:27] <DatAsuna> There are enemies that stand outside the level and shoot at you that vanguards can't charge. ME2 had more of them though
[1:03:28] <%VioletHeart> Borpses if you will.
[1:03:29] <%king_wragles> @akscully inb4 "I cAn'T gEt A lOcK"
[1:03:37] <peachy996> Volus are bros in MP
[1:03:38] <DatAsuna> luckily ME3 toned down the rocket launcher platforms
[1:03:39] <%JamesCorck> @Saffry_Ruzin Right? It'd be cool n.n
[1:03:40] <dawarw0lf> There are very little out of reach enemies unlike 2
[1:03:42] <Saffry_Ruzin> You could play Volus in the ME3 MP
[1:03:46] <%king_wragles> But other than those SPECIFIC instances, ya Vanguard has no range issue
[1:03:48] <+Goraka91> @Arancet Heck, the Krogan exist in the same series LUL
[1:03:50] <peachy996> They're always happy to regen your shields
[1:03:51] <%SpcOpsBear> Is it typical for the satelite of a very large planet to have an atmosphere like Palaven's moon has?
[1:04:02] <%Jmann1892> Volus are legit Biotic Gods in MP
[1:04:09] <Aiutare47> There are enemies that deal lots of melee damage and stagger however
[1:04:10] <%JamesCorck> Turians were sick in the ME3 multi, tho.
[1:04:14] <Saffry_Ruzin> Terraformed maybe?
[1:04:15] <%JamesCorck> Move slow, but hit hard.
[1:04:18] <%VioletHeart> The game has tons of weapons and armour.
[1:04:23] <%shadowsofpain> man I loved the Volus in MP
[1:04:34] <%LumberjackJack> They rush to give you all the basic ME2 weapons early on before giving you the good shit
[1:04:35] <DatAsuna> @JamesCorck not the turian jet troopers
[1:04:36] <%AJ_Cherenkov> that's the pat we know
[1:04:38] <+Goraka91> Turians were great in MP, but were they ''Krogan Vanguard with a hammer'' great?
[1:04:43] <Saffry_Ruzin> Awakened Collector and Geth Hunter were my favorite MP characters
[1:04:43] <Laecerelius> Burst rifles are good.
[1:04:47] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt good job
[1:04:49] <rekinom> Yeah?
[1:04:50] <DatAsuna> good sentence, pat

[1:06:19] <KeystoneA2> Paige's strokes are infectious apparently.
[1:06:21] <+Scevda> No not soft drink!
[1:06:22] <vicepresidentrichardhawk> MP was great
[1:06:22] <%SaiyanShoto> Sometimes Pat talks like Bizarro Superman
[1:06:24] <%somekindofsam> You've spent too much time with Paige
[1:06:24] <Saffry_Ruzin> But yeah, the Multiplayer was Lootbox shit, but I loved playing it nontheless
[1:06:24] <dawarw0lf> @ittla How dare you
[1:06:25] <Profmcstevie> Too much biotic charge has rattled you
[1:06:25] <%TheYellowcouch> You ever had a dream wher you, you , you could, you wantd if you chave you can do anything!?
[1:06:26] <DatAsuna> Krogan vanguard tho
[1:06:27] <GustauveVIII> i cant talk good either because thats always me forgetting words
[1:06:33] <stantheman_97> i was getting legit worried
[1:06:33] <%LumberjackJack> Like a single ant attacking a car
[1:06:34] <mr_saturday93> Multi....Player???
[1:06:39] <%Torus1025> Pat's on that loud
[1:06:42] <ittla> that shit needed an online pass too iirc
[1:06:45] <ittla> awful
[1:06:45] <Laecerelius> You're vanguard, you don't need luck.  You just need charge and nova
[1:06:46] <+AmericanSkidd> a life bar should show up just to taunt you
[1:06:48] <%greasypete00> god they look goofy when they ruin
[1:06:51] <%Solid_Stro> More players then one
[1:06:52] <%Varlinator> I miss the multiplayer so damn much!
[1:06:55] <RockinLockin> vanguard is so sick
[1:06:56] <dawarw0lf> @saffry_ruzin It was actually one of the first lootboxe shits. It started it.
[1:06:59] <Saffry_Ruzin> Krogan Warlord Sentinel was the shit with it's hammer that flattened enemies
[1:07:01] <+YabbaTroll> yep
[1:07:02] <generalve> YES
[1:07:03] <+Chaos_Aether> yes
[1:07:03] <%JohnAtDawn> 'Yes
[1:07:05] <Mattais88> Yeah
[1:07:05] <%VictorVonLouche> yes
[1:07:05] <KeystoneA2> Yes, but a fun horde mode
[1:07:06] <Laecerelius> yeah wave based horde mode
[1:07:07] <%SpcOpsBear> a horde mode with occasional objectives
[1:07:07] <+condemned_15> I heard there's a JoJo Part 6 Anime announcement in 6ish hours
[1:07:07] <+MrATheGreat> @PatStaresAt
[1:07:07] <ChungusQuest> yeah and it ruled
[1:07:07] <+akscully> yeah
[1:07:08] <GustauveVIII> yes
[1:07:08] <@commanderclaw> Co op horde mode with bespoke classes
[1:07:09] <+MrATheGreat> yep
[1:07:09] <%SpcOpsBear> like payload defense
[1:07:09] <%Jmann1892> yup
[1:07:11] <studleydoorite> I remember it with the mnemonic device "multiple players"
[1:07:11] <DatAsuna> Yeah 10 wave horde mode, with 3 objective waves
[1:07:11] <+Scevda> @americanskidd that would be a sick detail lol.
[1:07:12] <Laecerelius> With some objectives
[1:07:12] <+alphonseisbest> yea
[1:07:12] <%JohnAtDawn> It's great
[1:07:12] <%AJ_Cherenkov> yeah, best thing andromeda kept
[1:07:14] <+YabbaTroll> A damn good one
[1:07:14] <%LumberjackJack> Horde mode with a few objectives thrown in occassionally
[1:07:14] <%sniffy77> i actually had a lot of fun with it
[1:07:15] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> it had some objective rounds
[1:07:15] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt One that let you play as a Collector
[1:07:16] <%shadowsofpain> I really want to play the MP on my ps5
[1:07:16] <+alphonseisbest> and RULED
[1:07:16] <Javier9563> yes but it was super fun
[1:07:19] <tanarath> No, objectives too & cooperative @patstaresat
[1:07:19] <%Varlinator> Yeah, but it worked so well for some reason
[1:07:19] <penitentpendant> Class Based Horde Mode
[1:07:20] <peachy996> Yeah but the character variety is what people kept coming back to
[1:07:23] <%VioletHeart> 4-player co-op, basic structure but a TON of classes with weird new powerds.
[1:07:23] <das_sensentier> I forgot how good the music in ME3 was, damn
[1:07:26] <peachy996> And the gun variety
[1:07:27] <%gliph13> but a GOOD horde mode.
[1:07:27] <Lancaster_H> it was kinda killing floor-ish @PatStaresAt
[1:07:28] <%hatok> and you could finally play as other aliens
[1:07:30] <generalve> only thing in the series were you can play aliens :(
[1:07:32] <+alphonseisbest> And it RULED LIKE O'BRIAN
[1:07:33] <GustauveVIII> it'd be nice though if you could coop the campaign by having other people control your party members tho
[1:07:35] <%LumberjackJack> Well, exes can be like husks
[1:07:35] <dawarw0lf> I always wanted a endless wave mode
[1:07:35] <ChungusQuest> YOU COULD BE A VOLUS
[1:07:36] <DatAsuna> It's probably the second best horde mode game ever made.
[1:07:38] <stormhawk9891> VEGA
[1:07:38] <%Hemmy99> Horde mode in 10 round match ganes
[1:07:40] <+Scevda> It was solid, different varieties of enemies not just a single set
[1:07:40] <%Solid_Stro> I miss the multiplayer, it was addicting
[1:07:41] <Saffry_Ruzin> @patstaresat  Horde mode with many playable alien characters and objectives
[1:07:41] <generalve> james LUL
[1:07:41] <tronhd> It was sick
[1:07:41] <@commanderclaw> JAMES
[1:07:42] <Mattais88> james
[1:07:43] <%capnbeefs> She blue, seems legit
[1:07:44] <ittla> you had to grind for that variety or pay up
[1:07:48] <%shadowsofpain> I fucking love the N7 Paladin in multiplayer
[1:07:48] <das_sensentier> JAMES
[1:07:49] <+akscully> vega, go hit it
[1:07:49] <+DracosMagala> Vega
[1:07:53] <%MidnightBurst12> she is after the break up :(
[1:07:54] <dekkitout> Now for a moratorium on blue/grey suits
[1:07:54] <DatAsuna> MP also had collectors
[1:07:56] <+Goraka91> Unga bunga
[1:07:58] <+Scevda> @datasuna which you thinking is better?
[1:07:59] <+Alig200> lore-wise, its basically special forces of all races defending valuable locations/installations from reapers and cerberus.
[1:08:06] <+AmericanSkidd> beat it till it works
[1:08:06] <peachy996> Send the meathead to do tech repair
[1:08:07] <penitentpendant> Punch Tower Until It Works
[1:08:08] <%greasypete00> punch it like chris redfield would
[1:08:10] <Profmcstevie> flex on the comm tower
[1:08:11] <dawarw0lf> “Hit it with your muscles”…you joke but
[1:08:12] <+alphonseisbest> he will!
[1:08:15] <%Varlinator> Make sure to have him do the repairs on Rannoch
[1:08:16] <Javier9563> in another mission if you ask him to repair something he does just that
[1:08:18] <+critikal_bit> Some good ol fashioned Percussive Maintenance
[1:08:23] <+Scevda> @solid_stro people still play it! You can find them pretty easily.
[1:08:23] <dekkitout> Punch it till it stops doing bad beeps
[1:08:25] <DatAsuna> @Scevda I don't love gears, but it's undeniable that gears has the most fleshed out and varied horde mode
[1:08:32] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait, does Charge trigger a biotic combo? That's broke as fuck
[1:08:41] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yeahh, the MP added back Collectors as a faction and made them cooler, on top of having playable Collector as a character
[1:08:44] <+MrATheGreat> @PatStaresAt basically it was horde where you got a whole bunch of classes like Drell Assassin or Turian Sentinel with pre made abilities and stats, which you leveled up to take on harder difficulties
[1:08:45] <%AJ_Cherenkov> oh yeah
[1:08:47] <Mattais88> Yes it is
[1:08:49] <dawarw0lf> Have James Carnage then charge pat
[1:08:49] <+condemned_15> Ultra Instinct Shep
[1:08:50] <+akscully> when you charge, your shields recharge
[1:08:55] <Laecerelius> Hell yeah charge triggers biotic bursts!
[1:08:56] <+Scevda> @alig200 that was also nice and cohesive
[1:08:58] <+TDotGoat> sipsipHellmo
[1:08:59] <%vivaldiva> psaDogchamp
[1:09:03] <%AJ_Cherenkov> I think nova does too, but vanguards have a hard time priming combos
[1:09:06] <dawarw0lf> He don’t like me 3. He didn’t like the ending either
[1:09:07] <%Jmann1892> Playable Collectors were great
[1:09:08] <OldManDeckardCain> gief just wants to save you from mass effect 3 LUL
[1:09:12] <Yrefe> just spam nova, then charge, then nova, and that'll save the galaxy right away
[1:09:14] <+AmericanSkidd> The only way for the Reapers to win is to posses your pets to stop you from playing
[1:09:16] <dekkitout> Why is the Paw Pad Rebellion going on in your living room
[1:09:17] <+condemned_15> he's manipulating you into giving him treats
[1:09:18] <Coystick> "FUCK"
[1:09:19] <SilverFaustX> good boi
[1:09:23] <%EarleRiser> Good Gief!
[1:09:23] <+Essixian> HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOI
[1:09:23] <+NotaryRotary> good boy
[1:09:23] <DatAsuna> Also yeah, has pat grasped the power combo system? cause pat's gonna need his squadmates to prime most combos
[1:09:27] <+YabbaTroll> playable geth juggernaught was so good
[1:09:30] <KeystoneA2> Cerberus Phoenix was rad
[1:09:32] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah Piage is gonna stream today
[1:09:33] <+YabbaTroll> they went all out with the last update
[1:09:44] <%NocturneNovember> I like fatty pig dog
[1:09:54] <Saffry_Ruzin> The MP characters could essentially solo the War if you based it on Galactic Readiness in the OG ME3
[1:09:55] <peachy996> I was Infiltrator in MP, which means you juggle Team Healing Objectives and Weakening Enemy Defenses with standard shootan
[1:09:56] <dawarw0lf> Do more combos pat!
[1:09:59] <peachy996> It was fun
[1:10:01] <DapperCadavr> the shots of reapers in the distance are so good
[1:10:03] <%Solid_Stro> psaDogchamp ?
[1:10:05] <+Scevda> @datasuna given the different enemies in ME, how do you see it as more varied? Or are you referring to the enemy AI? In that case ya its quite a bit weaker here.
[1:10:06] <%LumberjackJack> He said he finished before Zangief wanted attention
[1:10:08] <DapperCadavr> also chat what class is he?
[1:10:09] <%JohnAtDawn> Yep
[1:10:10] <Javier9563> @AJ_Cherenkov you can prime enemies with incendiary ammo and detonate them with charge
[1:10:11] <@commanderclaw> Corinthus
[1:10:12] <+Alig200> Corinthus
[1:10:14] <%AJ_Cherenkov> corinthius
[1:10:15] <+Essixian> Corinthus
[1:10:16] <Halospaz117> Corinthus
[1:10:16] <peachy996> Corinthus
[1:10:16] <+akscully> corinthius
[1:10:17] <%NocturneNovember> Corinthus
[1:10:17] <+Goraka91> Corinthus, but yes
[1:10:17] <+AmericanSkidd> Corinthus?
[1:10:17] <%LumberjackJack> Corinthius
[1:10:25] <ChungusQuest> The sadsack in ME1 was SEPTIMUS
[1:10:25] <+rageoftheporo> all turians are like that tho
[1:10:26] <RockinLockin> totally different LUL
[1:10:29] <%TheYellowcouch> Only cowards use subtext
[1:10:32] <das_sensentier> Corintits
[1:10:33] <Mattais88> the counciler is sparticus or something
[1:10:34] <+AlexanderEspen> Corinthius Leather
[1:10:34] <+Goraka91> OC
[1:10:35] <+Scevda> @saffry_ruzin that was dlc in the original release.
[1:10:40] <@commanderclaw> Garrus the Roman Legionare would be cool
[1:10:41] <+AmericanSkidd> Remember, Space Romans
[1:10:42] <KeystoneA2> All turians have rad Roman names
[1:10:42] <penitentpendant> At least it's not "General Pyrrhic"
[1:10:44] <%AJ_Cherenkov> they've always had really latinoid names
[1:10:45] <blackjack8182> Like the helmet
[1:10:51] <Minorou> Is Garrus turian for Gary?
[1:10:52] <peachy996> The next Primarch's name is also roman I believe
[1:10:56] <dekkitout> Wasn't one of the background dudes named Brutus?
[1:10:59] <+Goraka91> @penitentpendant Bruh

[1:12:47] <+akscully> super general
[1:12:48] <ChungusQuest> Field Marshall?
[1:12:48] <penitentpendant> "Hero Unit" can always pull rank
[1:12:49] <%king_wragles> Admirals have no say over generals

[1:13:04] <DianaTheAscian> big shot now
[1:13:05] <Zombrocom> "Special Advisor" I suppose
[1:13:05] <Halospaz117> Garrus is his own rank
[1:13:07] <%king_wragles> If anything, Garrus would be a 5 star general compared to Corthinus's 3 stay
[1:13:09] <+MrATheGreat> VICTUS
[1:13:12] <M0untain_wolf> Victus is bro
[1:13:13] <macathelo> bye mexican gutts

[1:13:22] <+AmericanSkidd> Adrian
[1:13:24] <%CalderGaming> a MAVERICK
[1:13:27] <+Scevda> Garrus is like head of FBI special unit
[1:13:28] <peachy996> I never got why he was named Adrien
[1:13:28] <Laecerelius> Like war crime loose or....
[1:13:44] <%jillyrancher> General Corinthus more like General Sexy
[1:13:47] <@commanderclaw> Smart tactics sounds like
[1:13:49] <%hatok> the classic Mass Effect through line of people who could get results if it weren't for those pesky rules
[1:13:59] <Laecerelius> Yeah
[1:13:59] <peachy996> Adrien Victus is a good turian
[1:14:01] <Meekest> He sounds like he fucks

[1:14:38] <+cursedwithadhd> in turian it means tree
[1:14:38] <peachy996> All the turians have cool names
[1:14:44] <+Scevda> General Epicus Gamerus
[1:14:46] <Laecerelius> Uhhhhhh...  EDI?  Wha happun?!
[1:14:46] <peachy996> Like they're just fun words to say
[1:14:47] <%LumberjackJack> Another convenient moment for the squad to be 3 at max
[1:14:47] <%Varlinator> She's plugging herself into the Robobooty USB

[1:31:01] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 they are yes
[1:31:05] <anAngryHamster> The idea of any species mounting a resistance for more than a day is ludicrous
[1:31:06] <KeystoneA2> The Cerberus Harrier is the best, tho
[1:31:12] <ThatGuyThere03> Oh no, not New yoooooooooooooooooooork
[1:31:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> No the Knicks!!!
[1:31:30] <tattleworm> andromeda plays even better when it comes to powers but all the guns feel TERRIBLE in comparison
[1:31:32] <blackjack8182> @keystonea2 Best weapon
[1:31:32] <%dilly2lame> m7 Lancer is so stupidly good
[1:31:35] <%king_wragles> none of us ARE beating the Reapers alone, grammar is still important in war
[1:31:37] <+Scevda> Vindicator is a great gun.
[1:31:40] <%hatok> a friend of mine described Andromeda as a character action game mixed with a 3rd person shooter
[1:31:40] <Daskolin> W8 New York is gone? Are Reapers good guys?
[1:31:41] <dawarw0lf> I wish it was somewhere in 2
[1:31:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Shouldn't that be "none of us ARE beating the reapers alone"?
[1:31:48] <%shadowsofpain> like no contest
[1:31:51] <$Futurecity10> To put it into perspective, the USA was making a battleship every week, lets say it takes 1 month to make a dreadnaught, thats 84 dreadnaughts by this time if they had prepared
[1:31:54] <dawarw0lf> It would of fixed it feeling a micguffn
[1:32:02] <M0untain_wolf> I mean look at the background animation
[1:32:06] <%VioletHeart> Pat being blind again.
[1:32:06] <%lloyddboy> Yeah
[1:32:06] <%CalderGaming> I'll say this at least once every stream: ME3 is a great journey with a poorly written ending
[1:32:08] <+D00msDayDan> i should go
[1:32:09] <valriot> Reapers also target the highest threat first, hence why Turians are getting torn apart so fast
[1:32:11] <ChungusQuest> James confirmed for technophile?
[1:32:19] <viewtifulr> beautiful men onboard that ship
[1:32:25] <%LumberjackJack> Shame the catalyst is literally brought up in this game only. If the dark energy hints in ME2 were related to that instead, the ending MIGHT have been a bit less shit
[1:32:26] <%jillyrancher> most of the galaxy isnt United for most of the game so Reapers just steamroll
[1:32:32] <Coystick> I can't believe James exists as a companion
[1:32:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> And Human's are STILL the next best, even with their fucked up fleets. What's that say about everyone else?
[1:32:41] <dawarw0lf> @caldergaming We’ll be beating the dead horse of that by the end huh.
[1:32:43] <valriot> M E A T
[1:32:44] <+Scevda> @futurecity10 not the best comparable due to complexity but it could have been great in terms of planetary defenses ala Reach.
[1:32:46] <%lloyddboy> whare's the m e a t
[1:32:46] <$Futurecity10> If every single species had ramped up production of military ships, they would have been able to gain an initial advantage
[1:32:48] <+YabbaTroll> Oh yeah I think James is like a military vehicle nerd
[1:32:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Unified Krogan LUL
[1:32:54] <Sunstalker> JUST THE MEAT$
[1:32:54] <%jillyrancher> yeah we fucked
[1:32:55] <+condemned_15> NEED PROTEIN
[1:32:57] <+unhuggable1> its such an intense departure from the 2nd games mood
[1:33:03] <+Goraka91> New guy
[1:33:03] <+unhuggable1> so depressing
[1:33:06] <@commanderclaw> YEP
[1:33:07] <+Scevda> WHERES THE BEEF
[1:33:10] <@commanderclaw> Himbo supreme
[1:33:10] <tattleworm> james is the "is mass effect 3 your first mass effect?" character
[1:33:11] <KeystoneA2> FNG
[1:33:11] <%jillyrancher> Batarians are nearly extinct
[1:33:11] <stormhawk9891> THE DUMBEST
[1:33:12] <peachy996> Yep
[1:33:12] <+MrATheGreat> yup
[1:33:13] <Coystick> Yeah and I hate it
[1:33:13] <Kat_k> yep lmao
[1:33:15] <%king_wragles> Space Ice-T
[1:33:15] <$Futurecity10> Yeah this game is LEGIT depressing if you take it seriously
[1:33:15] <DapperCadavr> james is LITERALLY a himbo
[1:33:15] <SkinnyRite> eeeeeyup
[1:33:17] <%jillyrancher> big sad
[1:33:17] <Halospaz117> YOU JUST REALIZED?
[1:33:17] <%machshop> JAMES IS THE MEAT
[1:33:17] <+akscully> yep
[1:33:17] <M0untain_wolf> Dum gun gay
[1:33:18] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yep
[1:33:19] <+Essixian> Yes, that is literally what he is
[1:33:21] <available_line> Nah, it's just the first mission.
[1:33:21] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So question: what is the Legendary Editions of the games like compared to the modded versions (like MEUITM)?
[1:33:21] <+unhuggable1> yeah he asks all the tough questions
[1:33:21] <Profmcstevie> He asks questions for audience
[1:33:21] <ChungusQuest> Slab Everyman
[1:33:21] <dekkitout> He's our himbo
[1:33:22] <valriot> James is so dumb I love him LUL
[1:33:22] <%TheYellowcouch> They're doing a really good job of making you look at the sky box and giving you context for what's happening
[1:33:24] <+alphonseisbest> HE A HIMBO
[1:33:24] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:33:24] <blackjack8182> Yep
[1:33:24] <+condemned_15> big titted himbo
[1:33:26] <Zombrocom> He's your riker
[1:33:26] <Laecerelius> Just start at the end!
[1:33:26] <Aiutare47> He’s the Gears
[1:33:27] <+SixxMakaveli> No
[1:33:28] <%lloyddboy> DESIGNATED HIMBO
[1:33:28] <+AmericanSkidd> what a crock of SHIT
[1:33:29] <Coystick> CAN'T WAIT TO START WITH RETURN OF THE JEDI
[1:33:29] <xcompleasedad> YEP
[1:33:30] <stantheman_97> which is fucking stupid
[1:33:31] <vicepresidentrichardhawk> THE new guy
[1:33:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> That claim was comical
[1:33:32] <+SixxMakaveli> Just No
[1:33:35] <KeystoneA2> "It just works"
[1:33:36] <peachy996> Bioware said the dumbest shit in the pr for this game
[1:33:36] <Aiutare47> The Mr. Gears
[1:33:38] <Meekest> ME3 had a lot of insane obvious lies
[1:33:40] <SaltyAzteca> THANKS MARKETING
[1:33:41] <+Scevda> HIMBO energy
[1:33:42] <+MrATheGreat> E3 had to sell Mass Effect 3 on Wii U somehow
[1:33:49] <+alphonseisbest> PLAY COLD STEEL AT 3
[1:33:50] <%dilly2lame> The quick start save is so fucked
[1:33:50] <peachy996> "This game will be like Return of the Jedi"
[1:33:56] <M0untain_wolf> waaht nooo
[1:33:56] <viewtifulr> yet folks still believed it
[1:33:56] <tattleworm> there's NEVER been a better time to jump in
[1:33:57] <DianaTheAscian> and people fell for it still
[1:33:57] <+Allyofwar> Witcher did that too.
[1:33:59] <Laecerelius> You WHAT?
[1:34:03] <zhenthrim213> "trails of Cold Steel 3 is the best place to start the trails sereis"
[1:34:03] <+condemned_15> Rise of Skywalker is the best place to start Star Wars LUL
[1:34:05] <%blistexthief> "Sure, it runs at 30 but it FEELS like 60" was a really good lie too
[1:34:06] <Deasmeister> He does himbo very well though
[1:34:06] <%JH1224> No spoilers obviously but has Pat already decided on the final choice or is he going to decide as the story unfolds?
[1:34:06] <dekkitout> What do you mean? Surely, Calculus 2 is the best way to learn Algebra
[1:34:09] <%SaiyanShoto> I feel like a lot of games do that with their third entries
[1:34:09] <Profmcstevie> Their own fans had to tell new people "lol no ignore that guy"
[1:34:10] <OldManDeckardCain> lies
[1:34:15] <+akscully> 'no, you don't need wrex, don't worry about, his brother is fine'
[1:34:16] <+Goraka91> Witcher 1 is uh, it exists
[1:34:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> WITCHER 1 SUCKS BALLLS
[1:34:19] <SkinnyRite> Bioware tried to warn us about Bioware's incompetencr
[1:34:21] <OldManDeckardCain> ok maybe for most because people are stupid
[1:34:21] <M0untain_wolf> unplayable Euro
[1:34:22] <%SaiyanShoto> My first Witcher game was 3 and I was fine
[1:34:22] <+StrikeTheErf> witcher 1 is mad trash
[1:34:22] <+MrATheGreat> Pretty much LUL
[1:34:23] <Eger007> not true
[1:34:24] <blackjack8182> You could start with 2. Starting with 3 is crazy!
[1:34:24] <Profmcstevie> Witcher 3 is the most playable and STILL
[1:34:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> At least with the Dragon Age trilogy you had new main characters and companions each time
[1:34:30] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So there's not harm in starting with Witcher 3?
[1:34:31] <tattleworm> witcher's decision importing was like "what shirt where you wearing"
[1:34:32] <incredibleCrayon> I just stopped after 10 minutes
[1:34:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like unironically it SUCKS SO MUCH BALLS
[1:34:33] <+MrATheGreat> START WITH 2
[1:34:34] <Lancaster_H> its really not
[1:34:34] <%PocketBearIllustrator> no*
[1:34:34] <peachy996> @akscully Exactly
[1:34:35] <%lloyddboy> every time i get filtered by the tutorial
[1:34:35] <OldManDeckardCain> witcher 1 is still the best witcher game
[1:34:36] <hippofant> Also, Witcher 3 is hella confusing even if you played Witcher 2 LUL
[1:34:36] <Halospaz117> I love it and you are 100% right
[1:34:36] <Coystick> They were sneaky with Witcher 3, the III was disguised as the claw marks in the logo
[1:34:39] <%gliph13> I tried playing with mods could barely get halfway through it
[1:34:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> What's weird is that Witcher 3 has more tie ins with the BOOKS than Witcher 1&2 combined
[1:34:44] <dawarw0lf> Witcher 3 is ok as it starts following the books in 3
[1:34:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> 2 is BETTER
[1:34:47] <zhenthrim213> anyone here played the Trails sereis
[1:34:49] <%MightyDuckShoes> man. I skipped this game just because of the fact they lied about what the third entry would be. It was naive, but I was going and video game companies can't seem to help lying and overselling
[1:34:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> But 3 is good
[1:34:54] <artoflec> Act 2 is fuckin rough in witcher 1 but i think pushing past that it's kind of amazing
[1:34:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Doesn't it run on some mad modified version of the NWN aurora engine? It's crazy
[1:34:56] <+Scevda> @thomasoftroy yep, thats the strength of that structure.
[1:34:56] <+akscully> not on casual now, pat
[1:34:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Garrus is so far down the list it's not even close.
[1:35:00] <+Goraka91> @ThomasOfTroy Do it's detriment really, after 1 all the characters are just imitation Shepards
[1:35:04] <SkinnyRite> Wwweeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:35:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> 3 is best and its STILL clunky
[1:35:08] <Halospaz117> Damn, never really gave this games OST that much attention but this is some good shit
[1:35:10] <peachy996> Welcome To Hardcore
[1:35:17] <+Scevda> Primarch-kun notice me

[1:37:27] <%BlackStarAura> YAY
[1:37:27] <%jillyrancher> this one firefight is more exciting than 80% of ME2's firefights lol
[1:37:29] <Profmcstevie> Now THAT'S a Shepard I would love to see from the other side
[1:37:31] <karl_rex> Heavy Weapons are now pickups
[1:37:40] <+Scevda> Reminder that pausing in-battle allows you to turn freely for target acquisition. @patstaresat
[1:37:45] <+Krecart> @PatStaresAt You don't carry heavy weapons anymore, but they do show up as pick ups here and there.
[1:37:51] <+MrATheGreat> What it is is wasted because you just finished the fight
[1:37:58] <DatAsuna> Did you get it off them?
[1:37:59] <+alphonseisbest> YEYEYE HE BEGINING TO UNGA AND BUNGA WITH VAN
[1:38:03] <+MrATheGreat> Heavy weapons being pick-ups sucks imo

[1:38:32] <%intestinal_bleeding> I will say they did a good job of making the fight against the Reapies absolutely hopeless
[1:38:33] <tanarath> Such a great shot
[1:38:33] <dawarw0lf> And leave your burning home
[1:38:35] <%Bailey__gaming> woo

[1:39:21] <Aiutare47> Haven’t most turian families?

[1:41:50] <+alphonseisbest> ASHLEY WAS RIGHT
[1:41:53] <Coystick> ELMO
[1:41:54] <+AmericanSkidd> at least the Salarians SHOW UP
[1:41:57] <+alphonseisbest> SHE WAS FUCKING RIGHT
[1:41:58] <KeystoneA2> Reminder that Ashley was totally right
[1:41:59] <RedPlasticCup> elmoooooo
[1:41:59] <chiglit> EMLO
[1:42:01] <peachy996> Don't worry Pat she'll get hers

[1:42:01] <%IamGrapes> BIG MONEY GET
[1:42:02] <%VictorVonLouche> ye
[1:42:02] <Meekest> They literally are elves
[1:42:04] <RockinLockin> Admiral Hacket is the real OG
[1:42:04] <blackjack8182> Twileks > Asari
[1:42:05] <%RonaldMcDownload> Eat the Smurfs
[1:42:09] <CarrotWhisky> Even in space, elves are the worst
[1:42:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> Go get those missions from Hacket and then get Javik @PatStaresAt
[1:42:09] <%TheYellowcouch> Remove Asari
[1:42:10] <Kat_k> salarians are upset but at least they still show up
[1:42:11] <%ahomeschooldropout> ASHLEY DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:42:12] <mr_saturday93> What a dumb bitch
[1:42:13] <RayCSmooth> space elves
[1:42:15] <%jillyrancher> I love you Liara but ASARI SUUUUUUUCK
[1:42:15] <%strakillias> The Asari aren't even being attacked yet btw
[1:42:19] <+alphonseisbest> ASHLEY WAS SO GADAMN RIGHT LUL LUL LUL
[1:42:20] <MrPandastic> Why do the councilors fail to understand that the Reapers will fuck up everyone individually.
[1:42:21] <+Scevda> Thats only the beginning for the asari bs.
[1:42:26] <PaperyHornet1013> ASHLEY DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:42:27] <%QueequegTheater> ASHLEY WAS RIGHT
[1:42:27] <ThatGuyThere03> the Asari are still fucking dumb
[1:42:30] <+akscully> "lol, sounds like a you problem"
[1:42:30] <%jillyrancher> damn right
[1:42:33] <TioXyco> @ahomeschooldropout breathing was her wrong ting to do
[1:42:33] <blackjack8182> Ashley was right!
[1:42:38] <SomeAsianDood> nope they're fine
[1:42:38] <%Movemeister> Eussy or Bussy, it’s all the same
[1:42:41] <dekkitout> @blackjack8182 At least the Twileks have a history of standing up and fighting
[1:42:46] <mr_saturday93> Good luck fighting off the reapers alone asari
[1:42:47] <+ryuguitarfreak> ASHLEY DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:42:48] <+Dreadknight297> of course ashely was right.
[1:42:57] <SummonerMagno> human leaders would probably be doing the same in their place
[1:42:58] <+Goraka91> Ashley gang
[1:43:01] <%TheYellowcouch> Earth sure got pegged
[1:43:02] <%NocturneNovember> @Movemeister As long as it's tight, it's alright
[1:43:05] <M0untain_wolf> SHIT
[1:43:07] <+AmericanSkidd> fuck
[1:43:14] <SaltyAzteca> RANGERS LEAD THE WAY HACKETT
[1:43:15] <arkv01> thats ruff buddy
[1:43:16] <+ryuguitarfreak> DAMN
[1:43:18] <zhenthrim213> THATS ROUGH BUDDY
[1:43:23] <+MrATheGreat> SEND IN THE ANIME
[1:43:25] <%greasypete00> i think people will forgive him given the  circumstances
[1:43:25] <+Scevda> Lewd
[1:43:26] <peachy996> the head of the dick
[1:43:28] <+SixxMakaveli> Shepard is the TIP
[1:43:29] <+purplestufff> is that optimus prime
[1:43:37] <blackjack8182> Thats rough buddy
[1:43:38] <dekkitout> Ze plan is Blitzkreig
[1:43:39] <xcompleasedad> Carthage percentage wise was worse, BUT......
[1:43:42] <%Solid_Stro> Just the tip
[1:43:42] <+coffeefiend97> Say what you want about 3 but the tone was great
[1:43:43] <+c4llmesnuggles> havent tuned in for a while what class u playing as
[1:43:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> You already presided over the most devasting circumstances in human history and managed to keep fighting
[1:43:46] <+MrATheGreat> Just the tip
[1:43:49] <Profmcstevie> 50 pretty good people
[1:43:51] <%TheYellowcouch> We'll need to take them from behind!
[1:43:54] <+Scevda> @purplestufff nah a different old man VA thats beloved
[1:43:55] <ThatGuyThere03> why are there not several more Normandy clone vessels being made?
[1:44:00] <%IamGrapes> @PatStaresAt does this still have the thing where the multiplayer is tied in to the singleplayer in terms of the war status?
[1:44:04] <mr_saturday93> @purplestufff no but I know the actor played the main villain on MW2
[1:44:06] <Deasmeister> Save us mc
[1:44:11] <DatAsuna> waves and waves of men until their kill limits are reached
[1:44:16] <Zombrocom> Nope
[1:44:18] <MarylandJutsu> @IamGrapes nope it was removed
[1:44:19] <%hatok> @ThatGuyThere03 Normandy cost like, trillions of credits
[1:44:25] <Meekest> I've been scanning a lot of planets, Hackett
[1:44:32] <+purplestufff> gotcha
[1:44:37] <Coystick> It's a big Mallet
[1:44:37] <tanarath> It's magic mcguffin bullshit
[1:44:44] <+tinytinykittycat> Using just the tip to delay the finish
[1:44:53] <+Scevda> Hackett is so dope. Read his codex entry
[1:44:55] <Coystick> Giant fucking space bike chain
[1:44:55] <dekkitout> Is this a different reaper killing weapon from the one in ME2?
[1:44:59] <M0untain_wolf> Fact
[1:44:59] <+AmericanSkidd> did it anyway
[1:45:00] <DatAsuna> @ThatGuyThere03 yeah 1 normandy is as expensive as an entire fleet
[1:45:03] <%TheYellowcouch> And that turned out GREAT
[1:45:06] <+Goraka91> THEY SURE DID
[1:45:06] <KeystoneA2> That's true, btw
[1:45:07] <+thelonechris> There's was somehow only 2 world wars in this universe?
[1:45:10] <%CalderGaming> [Peter Stormare voice from Command and Conquer Red Alert 3] We don't even know if it WORKS!!!
[1:45:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ThatGuyThere03 In ME1, they say that the normandy cost as much as 12,000 fighter craft. The money is probably better spent elsewhere in this case
[1:45:13] <+tinytinykittycat> thats true about nukes
[1:45:13] <%demiiluna> Yeah that was a real concern
[1:45:14] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[1:45:14] <%captain_kirkhammer> That's actually not true, none of them seriously thought that
[1:45:16] <%Arancet> its true, they were worried it could light up the entire planet
[1:45:18] <%LumberjackJack> AND NO OTHER PROBLEMS HAPPENED AFTER THAT
[1:45:20] <%Larry_Q> they proved it couldnt first
[1:45:25] <stantheman_97> yeah the bomb was a bit of a gamble
[1:45:32] <+Goraka91> @thelonechris If there was a 3rd world war there wouldn't be an Earth
[1:45:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> knowing that makes it a lot more fucked up when you also know they didn't need to use it
[1:45:39] <generalve> DEAD FUCKING WRONG
[1:45:40] <DatAsuna> Also cerberus gets insane level ups in between each game
[1:45:40] <MarylandJutsu> We gotta defeat the reapppperrrs
[1:45:46] <peachy996> "he wants da blue ending sir"
[1:45:51] <Coystick> Oh god I forgot about the Cerberus cringe ninja they got
[1:45:54] <+akscully> hell yeah, hackett
[1:45:54] <+Alig200> also worth noting that the Alliance would only know how make SR1-type Normandy frigates, NOT the SR2, which likely only Cerberus would know.
[1:45:54] <zhenthrim213> my man Hackett
[1:45:57] <+Scevda> YA YOU WOULD THINK SO HUH
[1:45:58] <MrPandastic> Wnat a stupid idea.
[1:46:01] <%QueequegTheater> I love Hackett
[1:46:10] <peachy996> Hack it out
[1:46:11] <das_sensentier> Well TIM DID revive Shepard with science
[1:46:12] <T_Sasquatch> oh yea didnt pat say he never played me3 ?
[1:46:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Reminder that Ashley was 100% right
[1:46:20] <Zombrocom> Hackett says pick red
[1:46:22] <%TheYellowcouch> omg
[1:46:22] <generalve> LUL
[1:46:25] <tattleworm> hackett have you considered there might be a ridiculous green option
[1:46:26] <%TheYellowcouch> the game knows
[1:46:26] <SaltyAzteca> HEH
[1:46:26] <%NocturneNovember> @Coystick A crinja, you could say
[1:46:27] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[1:46:27] <+bubblebasspickles> HE SAID IT
[1:46:28] <%UvBenServed> heh
[1:46:28] <+Goraka91> YEAH MEMES
[1:46:29] <dawarw0lf> The game does good at speckling blue and red endings. Wish they did the same as greenz
[1:46:30] <+thelonechris> Weren't they afraid that the atom bomb would set the Earth's air on fire or something?
[1:46:32] <%intestinal_bleeding> hahah, thing has been said
[1:46:33] <+YabbaTroll> YEAH
[1:46:33] <MarylandJutsu> Even Kaiden?
[1:46:33] <%gliph13> @patstaresat  what about Jacob
[1:46:33] <+Scevda> Outside of reviving shepard that is
[1:46:34] <%Varlinator> I CLAPPED
[1:46:37] <CarrotWhisky> He said the thing!
[1:46:37] <thehark90> @T_Sasquatch not past the first like hour. this is new stuff for him
[1:46:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> C A L I B R A T I O N S
[1:46:48] <MarylandJutsu> THEY SAID THE THING
[1:46:48] <%SpcOpsBear> GO 👏 GET 👏 JAVIK 👏 NEXT 👏
[1:46:49] <%TheYellowcouch> Can't wait to see big Calbrungus
[1:46:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Alig200 If they've had the SR2 for a few years and are able to retrofit it, they probably know how to build more of them
[1:47:05] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Make sure to talk to everyone after every mission. Everyone has something to say after nearly every mission. even minor ones.
[1:47:06] <MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt do you even love Kaiden?
[1:47:11] <+akscully> can i kiss you, primarch?
[1:47:14] <dawarw0lf> Make sure you talk to garrus before the thing
[1:47:14] <T_Sasquatch> @thehark90 👍
[1:47:18] <peachy996> Pat has never played ME3 the whole before. While he has heard about the big things he doesn't know everything so chill with the big spoilers
[1:47:26] <+StrikeTheErf> @ThomasOfTroy they had it for like 6 months iirc
[1:47:36] <peachy996> Yeah Victus is awesome
[1:47:47] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm a man, too, y'know. I go peepee standing up!"
[1:47:49] <MarylandJutsu> Victus is cool
[1:47:51] <%QueequegTheater> Victus says shoot first
[1:47:52] <MarylandJutsu> he can get in the car
[1:47:52] <%TheYellowcouch> "He talked about you big long rifle"
[1:47:53] <%ohno778> Well we all got to make sacrifices.
[1:47:55] <peachy996> I hate this game but there are characters I very much like in it
[1:47:55] <+RAWPowerStudios> Why is the main character the worst voice actor? He annoys the hell out of me.
[1:47:55] <DSD24> "I never asked for this"
[1:47:56] <+Alig200> @Alig200 they only had the SR2 for six months, I'm assuming that would be too little time to build more of even get the plans ready, but you may be right.
[1:47:56] <generalve> NOT GOOD
[1:47:58] <DatAsuna> victus a bro
[1:48:04] <dawarw0lf> I hope chat can handle themselves. Spoilers are the worst
[1:48:05] <Verriand> Do we all yell Officer down If Garrus takes a hit?
[1:48:16] <MarylandJutsu> @RAWPowerStudios Jennifer Hale is the Female version and shes MUCH BETTER
[1:48:23] <+tinytinykittycat> Turians invented that tactic
[1:48:23] <DSD24> So Reapers play Rushdown?
[1:48:35] <+D00msDayDan> thoughts and prayers
[1:48:38] <+akscully> check on your war assets!
[1:48:43] <MarylandJutsu> in other words....shits fucked
[1:48:44] <xcompleasedad> Are the mods up-to-date with spoilers?
[1:48:45] <KeystoneA2> yes
[1:48:46] <+Goraka91> @MarylandJutsu They're about the same, honestly I prefer male shep, femshep always sounds angry
[1:48:47] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf somebody already spoiled tiptree let's hope nothing else gets spoiled

[1:57:26] <arkv01> what do you mean NO PunOko
[1:57:27] <MarylandJutsu> ITS TRUE
[1:57:29] <DapperCadavr> man, I still can't believe how monotone male shep is

[1:57:29] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[1:57:30] <MarylandJutsu> BOTH ARE TRUE
[1:57:31] <stantheman_97> LUL LUL
[1:57:33] <KeystoneA2> But what if you really like corn chips?
[1:57:33] <@commanderclaw> Renegade shep has no chill
[1:57:36] <yeildingthought> Damn. LUL
[1:57:39] <Profmcstevie> A stale chip
[1:57:40] <+Goraka91> Renegade Shepard is actually stupid (cool in 2 though)
[1:57:41] <+tinytinykittycat> just for giggle really
[1:57:43] <Kat_k> don't drink THAT garrus, it's not dextro, you'll get sick

[1:57:49] <+Chaos_Aether> Eden Prime Next?
[1:57:57] <%das_sensentier> LUL
[1:57:59] <Coystick> Based optimistbro
[1:58:01] <DatAsuna> yes, being a cop taught you that sure
[1:58:07] <+akscully> "what I learned in c-sec--beating up suspects"
[1:58:20] <zhenthrim213> so the Impeirum
[1:58:23] <%intestinal_bleeding> turians play TW games and see pyyrhic victories as a campaign goal
[1:58:24] <generalve> AT LEAST WE GOT A FEW HITS IN - turians
[1:58:33] <MarylandJutsu> after the Arrival DLC *looks to camera*
[1:58:41] <+Chaos_Aether> O_O
[1:58:41] <%lloyddboy> DADDY VAKARIAN
[1:58:43] <FlyguyJP> Daddy Garrus?!
[1:58:44] <%TheYellowcouch> and he was right
[1:58:45] <Profmcstevie> Not free, he didn't perfect me - Turians going 0-2
[1:58:45] <DatAsuna> His dad is in andromeda too
[1:58:52] <Deasmeister> I like how renegade works in 3 with influence
[1:58:55] <+AmericanSkidd> I wanna meet Garrus's dad
[1:58:56] <DatAsuna> as a flashback
[1:59:01] <FlyguyJP> NEOPOTISM HO
[1:59:03] <+Goraka91> No one cares about Andromeda
[1:59:03] <+tinytinykittycat> Garrus W. Vakarian
[1:59:07] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Yeah I didn't like that he shows up
[1:59:17] <DatAsuna> it was silly
[1:59:20] <peachy996> It was a little too forced
[1:59:21] <anAngryHamster> I can't get invested in the story with how little people seem to care that the greatest galactic threat is performing mega genocide. "but the genophage tho"
[1:59:23] <%LumberjackJack> Fuck yeah, Garrus's dad
[1:59:27] <+alphonseisbest> DOES THAT COME WITH A free trial to lv 60?
[1:59:32] <+StrikeTheErf> not the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14 that now has a free trial up to level 60 with the award winning Heavensward expansion?
[1:59:37] <%TheYellowcouch> Garrus but instead of talking about calibrations he just shills for ff14
[1:59:37] <DatAsuna> But also alec ryder should have been the main character
[1:59:50] <KeystoneA2> A tokin Turian
[2:00:09] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna I felt like that could have been just a retread of Shepard
[2:00:12] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Maybe. But I think they really wanted a Star Lord type of character
[2:00:14] <+Goraka91> It's criminal that Branden doesn't get more work, i've only noticed him in Mass Effect and XCOM
[2:00:19] <peachy996> And that was a mistake
[2:00:23] <%das_sensentier> @anAngryHamster I mean the krogans dont want to fight because even if they win against the reapers, they´d go extinct thanks to the genophage
[2:00:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> BUT THEN THE ENDING THOUGH
[2:00:37] <+DarkJaguar124> Liara though!
[2:00:43] <+AmericanSkidd> Even a tiny bit
[2:00:43] <+D00msDayDan> do they even say exactly when that expedition was sent out?
[2:00:43] <%LumberjackJack> Instead of a memory unlock, yup
[2:00:44] <valriot> Thats why you go there
[2:00:45] <KeystoneA2> @Goraka91 He's in LA Noire, too. And this one movie about Pharmaceutical companies murdering people
[2:00:45] <%ohno778> what's it like fornicating with a female turian?
[2:00:45] <+StrikeTheErf> I think the timeline doesn't match up, they left too soon
[2:00:46] <%hatok> that's literally the plot of Andromea
[2:00:46] <arkv01> lets just have a plan B eh
[2:00:47] <+alphonseisbest> FUCKING NODDERS
[2:00:48] <Ekaelis> Just out of nowhere dark space crossing ships
[2:00:48] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf Not really, shepard has no past he's running from or a dead wife he can't get over
[2:00:48] <+Goraka91> No it's entirely unrelated though!
[2:00:50] <%jillyrancher> His dad is in Andromeda Pat
[2:00:52] <peachy996> It's set around 2
[2:00:53] <Halospaz117> I think in Andromeda they left before the reapers?
[2:00:57] <%TheYellowcouch> Andromeda's biggest flaw is that it's a written like a young adult novel rather than big space opera
[2:00:57] <%VictorVonLouche> Wasnt Liara's face tired though?
[2:00:58] <Latija> yeah they just pulled something out of their ass because they wrecked the real story
[2:00:59] <+tinytinykittycat> Why would that improve andromeda?
[2:01:00] <%IamGrapes> i dont remember anything about Andromida. i didnt play much of it
[2:01:05] <+Chaos_Aether> Would those ship be destroy when  the Reapers came to the galaxy?
[2:01:05] <%subparSamaritan> That's literally the plot of Andromeda Pat
[2:01:07] <FlyguyJP> It was implied that was the entire motivation of the Andromeda mission but not making it blatantly clear and the focus
[2:01:08] <+akscully> yeah, should have sent them out at the beginning of 3 instead of between 2 and 3
[2:01:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> WHAT @jillyrancher
[2:01:10] <DatAsuna> yes andromeda left before the reapers
[2:01:18] <peachy996> The idea was that if you do the Andromeda thing the Reapers would have blown them up in Dark Space
[2:01:19] <generalve> LUL
[2:01:20] <kingdinkyI> They did talk about it and it didn’t make the game better
[2:01:25] <@commanderclaw> "Maybe you could be space President, and then I could be your Monika Lewinsky?"
[2:01:25] <%greasypete00> hes next maybe?
[2:01:26] <arkv01> LUL
[2:01:27] <DatAsuna> Also yes Pat would have gotten that if he played more
[2:01:30] <DSD24> A lot of style
[2:01:30] <peachy996> That's why they do it around 2
[2:01:31] <arkv01> what the hell shepard
[2:01:32] <%TheYellowcouch> I swear if he says make palevan great again I'll shit
[2:01:32] <Zombrocom> I think it was implied the andromeda project was a plan to escape the reapers
[2:01:35] <%ohno778> Garrus doesn't wanna be primearch
[2:01:37] <+DarkJaguar124> Shepard's eyebrows on fleek though.

[2:05:17] <%chill_o_wisp> man why is the PC version do bunk lmao
[2:05:20] <%VictorVonLouche> It was either your head breaking or the monitors
[2:05:21] <chiglit> the monitors should orient towards you
[2:05:23] <valriot> It was a bug in the original, and i image it was so bizarre and funny, they left it in
[2:05:24] <chiglit> in the original
[2:05:26] <quipquest1> Guys, Shepard is not Pockets.
[2:05:30] <KeystoneA2> I'm glad they didn't fix that.
[2:05:30] <%greasypete00> why didnt they just make it one big screen
[2:05:31] <%UvBenServed> Interference from Shepard's cyborg parts
[2:05:31] <DapperCadavr> pat did you save Kaidan or the space racist
[2:05:32] <Profmcstevie> They're SUPPOSED to be looking at you but seem to occasionally get tied to your orientation
[2:05:33] <+MrATheGreat> It's supposed to face shepard at all times, and does so by mirroring which direction Shaprard is facing
[2:05:37] <+AmericanSkidd> its a feature
[2:05:38] <DatAsuna> It's not just the pc version
[2:05:42] <FlyguyJP> I think they want to follow BOTH Shepard and Liara and are losing their shit

[2:06:09] <+condemned_15> no dishwasher. Thown out during the retrofit
[2:06:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt They are supposed to do an orientation constraint based on the position of the camera and the position of shepard. BUT they didn't do it right so it just does an orientation constraint on shepard FOR SOME REASON
[2:06:15] <%Ranryu692> yeah, definitely
[2:06:15] <dawarw0lf> You’ll get like .1 second off

[2:07:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> Epic for the win
[2:07:25] <%tank7013> Traynor is so relentlessly horny
[2:07:27] <MarylandJutsu> ZANGIEF DOES NOT like the lady
[2:07:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @OneGorillionDollars You cna move shepards stuff around and he'd probably lecture you touch thane's cup and your a DEADMAN
[2:07:29] <tanarath> Just for her
[2:07:29] <%SaiyanShoto> the animatronic is broken
[2:07:30] <PanicSwytch> YES

[2:07:30] <%Ranryu692> yeah it's rough
[2:07:31] <+condemned_15> Gief hates her LUL
[2:07:31] <kjb343> that's not the only thing that's creepy

[2:07:32] <+YabbaTroll> its the legs
[2:07:32] <+CyanDeadEye> We lost Emily Wong for this!
[2:07:32] <tattleworm> same with miranda, they just couldn't get it right
[2:07:33] <Mattais88> It's the cheeks I think
[2:07:34] <revoltingimp> bad lighting
[2:07:35] <dawarw0lf> Was there ever a mod to fix it?
[2:07:36] <GamerWorlock> Battle of the tits
[2:07:39] <FlyguyJP> It was clearly rushed. They did it in like 48 hours probobly
[2:07:39] <%subparSamaritan> Why does she look so baaad
[2:07:39] <+fetrigon> lighting maybe
[2:07:40] <Coystick> BATTLE TITS
[2:07:40] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Sip
[2:07:41] <Aiutare47> It’s uncanny
[2:07:41] <Zyzallar> Is that Jessica Cobot?
[2:07:42] <Laecerelius> She looks like she's made out of playdough
[2:07:42] <stantheman_97> even zangief is upset
[2:07:43] <%Varlinator> She's a Reject Barbie Doll
[2:07:43] <notsoy> this is almost as bad as some of the JAV stars in Kiwami 2
[2:07:45] <+D00msDayDan> the lighting makes her legs look like grandma legs
[2:07:45] <+AmericanSkidd> The clothes dont help
[2:07:46] <murdocismyhero> Why does her model look like a reaper
[2:07:47] <%Broand> I'm not a big fan of the lighting in this game
[2:07:50] <Zyzallar> no way lol
[2:07:52] <%SpcOpsBear> @Zyzallar unfortunately yes
[2:07:53] <tanarath> @zyzallar yes
[2:07:55] <%jillyrancher> yeah she looks terrible
[2:07:55] <%TheYellowcouch> Just wait until we punch her in the face like we do all reporters
[2:07:56] <Sunstalker> She looks like a reaper unit trying to blend in as a human but melting from the lights
[2:07:57] <peachy996> I almost feel bad for Chobot. There's no way she looks back on this well but she must have really wanted to be in a Mass Effect game
[2:07:57] <%Solid_Stro> Zangief hates it too psaDogchamp
[2:08:00] <%jillyrancher> I have no clue why
[2:08:03] <Jaysky> BUT PAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOOOT
[2:08:04] <$Ziegsy> shes got that karen face

[2:08:13] <%SaiyanShoto> give brojobs
[2:08:16] <dawarw0lf> Heads up pat everyone will have multiple things to say. Not all the time but sometimes.
[2:08:19] <dekkitout> Bros on deck- no gurls allowed
[2:08:21] <quipquest1> You can press R3 and the map will show you if characters are in rooms or not.
[2:08:21] <DatAsuna> also the upgrade deck
[2:08:22] <%jillyrancher> SHEPARD SHES A REAPER DOOMSDAY DEVICE
[2:08:23] <MarylandJutsu> the gay bro and the meat bro
[2:08:24] <%conchthechimera> SHEPHARD HER ASS IS A REAPER DOOMSDAY DEVICE
[2:08:25] <Zyzallar> @spcOpsBear why?
[2:08:25] <%YakumoYomi> Can I get a brojob on the brodeck?
[2:08:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt They used EDI's body as a basemodel then put the face on there without cleaning shit up and it looks terrible
[2:08:29] <Zyzallar> is she in this game?
[2:08:34] <%moonmintparadise> kissing the bros on the deck (not gay)
[2:08:35] <godila2> i hate that they killed emily wong for stupid ign thing cohhFail
[2:08:36] <%bravebravesrobin> Bros before hoes bro
[2:08:37] <+Alig200> @PatStaresAt pressing x for info on a part gives the stats in numbers
[2:08:43] <ThatGuyThere03> Those brutes have Pat SHOOK
[2:08:46] <KeystoneA2> N7 is pure health, Hahne Kedar is pure Gun Damage
[2:08:57] <%hatok> wouldn't shields work with your play style
[2:08:59] <FlyguyJP> Jacob "I can't wipe my bum" Vega
[2:09:03] <%Solid_Stro> Two bros chilling in a hot tub?
[2:09:15] <tattleworm> yeah, shields are the better call for a vg since you're always replenishing them
[2:09:29] <+Goraka91> I will forever see Freddie Prince Jr. as Fred in those horrible Scooby Doo movies
[2:09:29] <dawarw0lf> It won’t apply here
[2:09:31] <KeystoneA2> yeah
[2:09:33] <dawarw0lf> It’s always there
[2:09:36] <tanarath> I wouldn't, Stick to a pistol.
[2:09:40] <peachy996> Yeah it changes the appearance
[2:09:41] <DatAsuna> weight bonus is different from recharge speed
[2:09:42] <+CyanDeadEye> I don't really like that feature personally.
[2:09:42] <FlyguyJP> @Solid_Stro Three Yard Apart in the Flight Deck because they're not gay.
[2:09:43] <%Ranryu692> each mod changes the gun's appearance
[2:09:44] <+alphonseisbest> it won't show here
[2:09:45] <blackjack8182> Check the Spectre store
[2:09:45] <Mattais88> this speed is based only on weapon wieght
[2:09:47] <peachy996> A neat little touch
[2:09:54] <DatAsuna> Weight is calculated to generate a bonus that will stack seperately
[2:09:56] <%Ranryu692> there are a LOT of guns in this game
[2:09:59] <FlyguyJP> GOD THIS FREAK
[2:10:02] <DatAsuna> so more recharge will not give you more weight
[2:10:04] <%intestinal_bleeding> okay meat man
[2:10:08] <Javier9563> vega wants the robussy
[2:10:09] <%conchthechimera> SMH
[2:10:10] <%Chichen> gonna get her robo preggers
[2:10:10] <%MidnightBurst12> fair
[2:10:13] <%SpcOpsBear> HE'S NOT NORMAL
[2:10:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS A ROBOT
[2:10:13] <+Goraka91> DO NOT FIST ANDROID GIRLS
[2:10:13] <%SaiyanShoto> James got some fucking HOOTS
[2:10:13] <Laecerelius> Yeah he loves machines a lot
[2:10:14] <revoltingimp> look at those TRAPS
[2:10:15] <Halospaz117> AND HE'S NOT NORMAL
[2:10:15] <+Essixian> HE'S NOT NORMAL
[2:10:16] <%ohno778> Jimmy grows on you
[2:10:16] <ThatGuyThere03> JAMES IS NOT NORMAL
[2:10:16] <peachy996> I'M HUNGRY
[2:10:17] <dekkitout> Indeed
[2:10:17] <%Ranryu692> Vega's a big flirt
[2:10:20] <stantheman_97> HE'S NOT NORMAL
[2:10:21] <+Chaos_Aether> The movie
[2:10:22] <Coystick> I hate looking at him so much
[2:10:23] <mr_saturday93> it's funnier when playing as smfemsheo
[2:10:23] <dawarw0lf> WATCH THE ANIME
[2:10:23] <+akscully> he stares at femshep's chest in this convo
[2:10:24] <tattleworm> james tell me about the anime
[2:10:30] <blackjack8182> TMI
[2:10:32] <+AmericanSkidd> or watch a movie
[2:10:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do not fist android girls
[2:10:35] <%unstablebeast19> edi has a line, and shepherds reaction face to it is the funniest fucking thing. also imo bring edi on as many missions as possible
[2:10:36] <Coystick> He looks like a horrible monster
[2:10:37] <MarylandJutsu> get him drunk and have some sexxxxx
[2:10:50] <$Ziegsy> fubar is the least entertaining of the boohbahs
[2:10:54] <DatAsuna> There is one good scene in that movie and it's james facefucking the dirt in the rain talking to ghosts
[2:10:55] <FlyguyJP> James is like 5% testosterone by mass
[2:10:55] <%moonmintparadise> wonderful... he is a personality black hole
[2:10:56] <%conchthechimera> THIS BOY"S BEEN DRINKING HIS JUICE
[2:11:03] <%tinyswampthing> james is the only good human squadmate hes just a bro
[2:11:07] <RockinLockin> LUL
[2:11:08] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[2:11:12] <Coystick> Awful creature
[2:11:13] <+AmericanSkidd> Yeah vega looks off too
[2:11:14] <4_stars_out_of_50> I never hated Vega but I never played any of the games his character is ripped off of
[2:11:15] <Profmcstevie> The roids have broken him
[2:11:17] <+alphonseisbest> @moonmintparadise nah man He's a bro
[2:11:18] <+zaitje> LUL
[2:11:18] <DapperCadavr> he looks like a jojo but not in a good way
[2:11:20] <T_Sasquatch> i really expected james to be the gay romance
[2:11:20] <%NocturneNovember> fucking Brian Cage here
[2:11:22] <SaltyAzteca> DID I MISS SCOTT STEINER QUOTES
[2:11:25] <OldManDeckardCain> BUT I AM A GENETIC FREAK AND I AM NOT NORMAL
[2:11:25] <+Goraka91> Most do to be fair
[2:11:26] <ThatGuyThere03> It only took Bioware three games to write a human squadmate people like
[2:11:26] <%TheYellowcouch> His body is the same as the reporters face
[2:11:27] <%AJ_Cherenkov> He is the UR-jarhead
[2:11:33] <Lancaster_H> What's his name again?
[2:11:34] <blackjack8182> HE’S NOT NORMAL
[2:11:34] <Mattais88> Fathers...fathers..fathers...
[2:11:38] <Sunstalker> james feels like something they added to make new jersey shore people play the game
[2:11:38] <%Solid_Stro> James “I had an anime backstory”
[2:11:39] <FlyguyJP> James with those ROCK HARD Man-boobs
[2:11:39] <%Broand> is this your krogan teammate
[2:11:40] <+alphonseisbest> HE IS A GOOD LAD
[2:11:41] <%lloyddboy> STEAK FIZZLEBEEF
[2:11:41] <dawarw0lf> DADDY ISUES. It never ends huh
[2:11:43] <GuilKato> Family Family Family
[2:11:44] <%Chichen> he looks like he ate someone your size
[2:11:45] <DatAsuna> @4_stars_out_of_50 james is more nuanced than any CoD character ever, and I actually like the blops characters lol
[2:11:47] <%NocturneNovember> @Lancaster_H Slab Bulkhead
[2:11:51] <@commanderclaw> Zaeed>James>Jack>Kasumi>Kaiden>Miranda>Ashley>Jacob in terms of human squad mates
[2:11:52] <+alphonseisbest> He also a fucking Beefy boi
[2:11:57] <%BlackStarAura> Everybody in this series has daddy issues
[2:12:02] <SaltyAzteca> Shepat
[2:12:05] <revoltingimp> Ok Varrick
[2:12:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> He looks like a joe rogan podcast regular
[2:12:07] <%TheYellowcouch> Man's got no brians
[2:12:11] <+alphonseisbest> @commanderclaw THIS GUY GETS IT
[2:12:12] <peachy996> The only good thing I can say about Cortez is the fun argument he has with Vega about "Mako vs. Hammerhead"
[2:12:14] <+cermo55> hhhhmmmmmmmm
[2:12:17] <4_stars_out_of_50> @DatAsuna exactly and his banter with Cortez is good!
[2:12:19] <dawarw0lf> He’s ok
[2:12:21] <KeystoneA2> He's good
[2:12:23] <+AmericanSkidd> Vega you crashed the shuttle
[2:12:24] <GuilKato> see weirdly you can't make Vega and Cortez bang
[2:12:24] <%Ranryu692> James is genuinely a decent character
[2:12:24] <%snow_bush> James is a cool dude.
[2:12:25] <dekkitout> Beef McHugeslab
[2:12:25] <artoflec> his performance is good
[2:12:26] <tanarath> Vega is GREAT
[2:12:26] <%machshop> meatman
[2:12:27] <Profmcstevie> He's grounded
[2:12:27] <+Goraka91> @revoltingimp He's Bull oddly enough
[2:12:28] <%Jeemukun> I like James too
[2:12:29] <+alphonseisbest> HE A GOOD ONE
[2:12:30] <%Deano8817> I love meatheads
[2:12:30] <PanicSwytch> Way better than jacob
[2:12:32] <Halospaz117> THAT'S WHY HE'S GOOD
[2:12:32] <%Gorshum> He's pretty good.
[2:12:33] <peachy996> AND HE IS but James is a likable guy
[2:12:34] <DatAsuna> James only gets better later
[2:12:34] <%demiiluna> He's a Himbo!
[2:12:35] <%VioletHeart> He was made in a time before people realised the charm of a good himbo.
[2:12:35] <%Broand> Sometimes dumbass meatheads are good
[2:12:37] <Sunstalker> James is nice, I just hate how he looks, is all. I'm biased AF
[2:12:37] <GustauveVIII> james is okay but i never liked the loco nickname
[2:12:38] <Jaysky> @commanderclaw I kind of like Miranda's cold hearted bitch shtick
[2:12:39] <Botman_R> same
[2:12:39] <SpartanAltego> Yeah, James is a good egg.
[2:12:39] <DatAsuna> James is unironically based
[2:12:40] <blackjack8182> He’s cool
[2:12:40] <FlyguyJP> James is such an outrageous monster. He is a Human Krogan.
[2:12:41] <Doomstar16> He's pretty good.
[2:12:41] <Lancaster_H> he's just boring compared to everyone else
[2:12:42] <+Ches_Neckbeard> James was always good and it's about damn time people appreciate him
[2:12:43] <samcast1> no I liked him the most
[2:12:43] <GuyverTypeL> He is a good big boy
[2:12:43] <Lancaster_H> thats all
[2:12:44] <SaltyAzteca> Remember that time when Shepat jumped headfirst into a garrison filled with Brutes and Cannibals and came out ok? That was loco
[2:12:45] <%YakumoYomi> Speak to him often, and you'll find out how good he is
[2:12:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> James is underrated, partially because everyone wrote him off at first
[2:12:45] <dekkitout> Himbo homie
[2:12:47] <kingdinkyI> James is alright but I wish he was Grunt or Wrex
[2:12:48] <+OneGorillionDollars> Vega got so much hate he didn't deserve
[2:12:49] <+Goraka91> He's Kaiden/Ashley/Jacob but good
[2:12:49] <%Dopamien> james is cool, Jacob is who?
[2:12:49] <%SpcOpsBear> James Vega is the character that was written so new players had someone to relate to if they started from ME3.
[2:12:50] <PirateMike_> James is wack
[2:12:50] <Kat_k> he's a lot better when he's not constantly sexually harassing you
[2:12:50] <stantheman_97> he's like jacob but with personality
[2:12:51] <Blank9> he's good
[2:12:51] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt femshep gets a romance scene with him in the citadel dlc where she pressures him into sex and it's real real creepy
[2:12:53] <peachy996> Like I said before James is the better Jacob
[2:12:54] <ThatGuyThere03> @zanzibarian_hamster I can totally see him talking about how he'd fight a Krogan barehanded or some shit
[2:12:54] <%Chichen> MEEP
[2:12:55] <+Chaos_Aether> Back on Earth Pat
[2:12:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> Don't have all of them.

[2:13:07] <%saadi90> He is great in Citadel dlc
[2:13:07] <%MightyDuckShoes> "I got transfered form the COG Division, Shepard!"
[2:13:08] <Blank9> james gets an entire anime ova to him
[2:13:10] <GuyverTypeL> MEEP

[2:13:23] <chiglit> 'asset'
[2:13:26] <+Goraka91> @revoltingimp Guess someone at Bioware liked him
[2:13:26] <zhenthrim213> ASSet
[2:13:27] <%machshop> she's also a huge ass now
[2:13:28] <Jaysky> You aren't Kelly
[2:13:29] <MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt surprisingly Traynor is a very good carecter
[2:13:29] <FlyguyJP> I do understand how they need to add people incase you literally got everyone else killed.
[2:13:30] <peachy996> Her Asset is YUGE
[2:13:31] <%TheYellowcouch> yupp yupp a HUUUUGE ASSet

[2:14:01] <%Ranryu692> this is a fun mission
[2:14:01] <Aiutare47> Do that.
[2:14:02] <%king_wragles> I mean, EDI could have just told everyone everything was under control so there would be a panic, but there's 'no time' I guess..
[2:14:02] <+vaderxyz1970> STEAK LIARA I DO IT FOR THE STEAK
[2:14:02] <Jaysky> Where is my horny redhead
[2:14:06] <%SpcOpsBear> DO GRISSOM AND JAVIK IN ANY ORDER
[2:14:08] <tanarath> Pat, Grissom has a time limit
[2:14:09] <+Goraka91> ''Ascension''
[2:14:10] <%conchthechimera> oh yeah, where they shipped Jack off to
[2:14:12] <dawarw0lf> James, edi and liara will feel the role of your combat, tech and botic roles if everyone is dead.
[2:14:14] <%SpcOpsBear> BUT DO THEM BOTH FIRST
[2:14:16] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Grissom has a time limit, beware of that
[2:14:16] <+D00msDayDan> professor grisham's school for gifted biotics

[2:14:41] <%SpcOpsBear> @Goraka91 Ascension was the subtitle of the second novel, when the Grissom Academy first showed up
[2:14:42] <T_Sasquatch> one thing i fucking hate about me3 is that they tell you about "side missions" with no info that theres a time limit
[2:14:42] <bahookery> "commondah" cheers traynor
[2:14:43] <+D00msDayDan> @ThatGuyThere03 kaiden mentions it once in me1 if you're biotic
[2:14:45] <DatAsuna> This is a missable sidequest btw
[2:14:46] <peachy996> But also do this one

[2:15:26] <%demiiluna> Why you always Dogging on Kelly like that, Pat? She's not the Bitch you think she is.
[2:15:27] <%SpcOpsBear> @Goraka91 Because it kind of is? It's a biotics academy, but it doesn't have any cult shit going on.
[2:15:28] <+DarkJaguar124> She's like a little sister
[2:15:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, but Kelly is a descendent of Mr. Bucket, the sexual freak
[2:15:30] <@commanderclaw> Kelly was the kind of racist who makes excuses for her desire to fuck the untermenchen
[2:15:30] <PirateMike_> Too bad shes gay

[2:18:24] <arkv01> THICKER TITANIUM

[2:19:10] <Latija> ayy girl what that robo mouth do
[2:19:12] <FlyguyJP> Fully allowing an AI to self-modify with ZERO human oversight is begging for a worst case AI situation.

[2:19:16] <+alphonseisbest> YEAH U WOULD
[2:19:23] <+alphonseisbest> U horn dog
[2:19:29] <%SpcOpsBear> The weird thing is how you can tell EDI is trying to be written as a red flag for a singularity uprising, but it's often played only for laughs or to make thoughtful commentary on the actual moral issues of self-aware AI.
[2:19:32] <%ohno778> DOES THAT ROBOT ASS FART THO?

[2:26:36] <Latija> i guess nobody cares that you stole it while everything was exploding

[2:26:58] <GuilKato> go to grissom
[2:26:59] <available_line> Technically, she *IS* the ship, so she stole herself.
[2:27:01] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Get javik now, then do grissom
[2:27:01] <GuilKato> go now
[2:27:02] <supergoblinpunch> Do it first
[2:27:02] <%ahomeschooldropout> So get Javik, then go to Girssom
[2:27:03] <KeystoneA2> Go there right this second, trust us
[2:27:04] <mesamus> DO IT NOW
[2:27:04] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt 2-3 missions
[2:27:04] <%bread_assassin> Do it BEFORE Tuchanka.
[2:27:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You have 2-3 missions.
[2:27:04] <MarylandJutsu> yooo Aria is cool
[2:27:06] <%BlackStarAura> BEFORE Tuchanka
[2:27:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> remember Javik
[2:27:09] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You should PROBABLY GO DO IT NOW
[2:27:10] <DatAsuna> it's like the crew death time limit for the suicide mission
[2:27:11] <peachy996> YEAH BAU
[2:27:14] <kingdinkyI> Do it now
[2:27:15] <peachy996> I love that guy
[2:27:19] <%Garthunox> BEFORE TUCHANKA
[2:27:20] <+condemned_15> Javik tho
[2:27:21] <dawarw0lf> It ends after a certain point. It’s a specific mission that fails it
[2:27:21] <Coystick> Leave Grissom till the end
[2:27:24] <PaperyHornet1013> Priority time limit
[2:27:25] <M0untain_wolf> Go now or you wont see a teammate from me2
[2:27:26] <+AmericanSkidd> Hey a Specter who is not all evil
[2:27:30] <%Varlinator> Yeah, I'd say do it now, or after Eden Prime
[2:27:31] <MarylandJutsu> yooo Thane
[2:27:36] <DatAsuna> "I showed u my disease plz respond"
[2:27:38] <Laecerelius> THAAAAANE!
[2:27:41] <+Goraka91> :(
[2:27:42] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[2:27:44] <peachy996> Get Javik first, go to the Meeting, Take Javik with you, THEN do Grissom Academy
[2:27:45] <+akscully> DLC
[2:27:47] <Mattais88> DLC
[2:27:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> BRYSON IS DLC
[2:27:50] <%Ranryu692> you now have access to the full Citadel
[2:27:50] <%QueequegTheater> Thane Sadge
[2:27:52] <MarylandJutsu> Bryson is DLC
[2:27:52] <DatAsuna> later
[2:27:53] <peachy996> That's my input
[2:27:53] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Bryson is DLC
[2:27:53] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt The mission will disappear when you finish Tuchanka.
[2:27:57] <+theCatastrophy> Do Eden Prime first
[2:27:58] <karl_rex> Last 2 are DLC
[2:27:58] <%ahomeschooldropout> DO NOT GO TO BRYSON
[2:28:00] <GuilKato> go to grissom then go see sexy thane fishlips
[2:28:00] <dawarw0lf> One is dlc
[2:28:04] <%QueequegTheater> Do Grissom now
[2:28:04] <MarylandJutsu> the 2nd Aria email is ALSO DLC
[2:28:05] <dawarw0lf> One is main game
[2:28:07] <DatAsuna> Also yes dodge bryson till enggame
[2:28:11] <Alzero83> Kaidan is stupid and a waste of hooman
[2:28:14] <M0untain_wolf> one DLC and one warassets
[2:28:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You have 2-3 missions to do the Grissom, so go get Javik then do it.
[2:28:18] <%unstablebeast19> those last 2 were the docs omega and leviathan
[2:28:18] <%Garthunox> Bryson is the leviathan
[2:28:20] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt
[2:28:26] <+cermo55> do all side quests immediately, main missions will eventually lock you out, use guide for mission you get but cannot complete until later
[2:28:27] <peachy996> Javik, then Meeting, then Mission after meeting, then Grissom
[2:28:31] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt when you go to the Citadel, the DLCs are in separate areas when you land, very easy to avoid
[2:28:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is there a link to the guide?
[2:28:33] <MarylandJutsu> well they had to SET UP omega dlc BEFORE it hapened
[2:28:36] <tattleworm> the time limit is a couple priority missions away, there's no "x number of missions" timelimit
[2:28:38] <blackjack8182> Do Bryson before thessia
[2:28:52] <DatAsuna> there's no real need to actually do javik first, he adds nothing to grissom
[2:28:54] <%jillyrancher> I think Grissom Accademy has a 3 mission time limit
[2:28:57] <DatAsuna> do whatever order
[2:29:06] <blackjack8182> Do Aria after techunka
[2:29:06] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt When you get Javik DO THE SIDE MISSION ON EDEN PRIME, IF YOU MISS ALL THE TERMINALS IT'LL BE STUCK IN YOUR JOURNAL FOREVER AND IT FUCKING SUCKS
[2:29:12] <+AmericanSkidd> This is the part where you should ignore us
[2:29:13] <%jillyrancher> going to the citadel does not effect the time limit I think
[2:29:16] <peachy996> @DatAsuna No but we get him sooner than later
[2:29:18] <M0untain_wolf> NO
[2:29:19] <xcompleasedad> @tattleworm WRONG. Jack's mission IS on a timer
[2:29:23] <28moogles> Just do everything you can before non-DLC Priority Missions.
[2:29:25] <tanarath> NO
[2:29:27] <GuilKato> grissom before eden prime I think?
[2:29:28] <GuyverTypeL> GUIDE WRONG REEEEEE
[2:29:31] <M0untain_wolf> acadamy
[2:29:33] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that works
[2:29:33] <available_line> That's wrong.
[2:29:35] <dawarw0lf> That’s good and will work
[2:29:37] <tanarath> Do Grissom 2nd
[2:29:37] <%QueequegTheater> Guide is wrong
[2:29:37] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Javik should go to Surkesh
[2:29:38] <SaltyAzteca> So Grissom will be 3rd
[2:29:39] <GuilKato> really???
[2:29:39] <%jillyrancher> EDI has a good line on Grissom
[2:29:40] <+Krecart> Holy crap that's so much before the Academy
[2:29:40] <%Ranryu692> Guide is right
[2:29:40] <GuilKato> oh
[2:29:40] <+MrATheGreat> Do Grissom
[2:29:40] <Mattais88> Eden grissom then the rest
[2:29:41] <xcompleasedad> ACADEMY FIRST
[2:29:42] <stormhawk9891> NO
[2:29:44] <mesamus> @DatAsuna there's stuff you can easily mess up if you do it in whatever order
[2:29:44] <dawarw0lf> The guide is not work
[2:29:45] <tattleworm> @xcompleasedad incorrect
[2:29:46] <M0untain_wolf> guide dead worng
[2:29:48] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 yes but we get him either way
[2:29:48] <available_line> The guide assumes you haven't picked up the Grissom quest yet.
[2:29:49] <xcompleasedad> ACADEMY IS ON A TIMER
[2:29:49] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Eden Prime then Grissom
[2:29:49] <%Mr_Pylon> I know nothing weeeeee
[2:29:50] <KeystoneA2> Academy then whatever you feel like
[2:29:50] <peachy996> It's fine
[2:29:51] <%ahomeschooldropout> Do Grissom after Javik
[2:29:53] <+AmericanSkidd> IGNORE US
[2:29:53] <MarylandJutsu> oh boy this s hould be fun
[2:29:53] <@commanderclaw> IDK man, it's been 9 years
[2:29:54] <thetunnelhomer> As long as you do Grissom before Tuchanka
[2:29:54] <kingdinkyI> Oh that thing is super wrong
[2:29:54] <dawarw0lf> The guide is not wrong.
[2:29:55] <%coward_man> go to Grissom now or people die
[2:29:55] <%Solid_Stro> doodHokey
[2:29:56] <TheMostAverageGamer4> Eden def first
[2:29:57] <+MrATheGreat> Just do Acddemy jic
[2:29:57] <godila2> chat you are wrong
[2:29:57] <%DrTomT18> go to citadel first
[2:29:57] <%unstablebeast19> that is more do all that before the next priority
[2:29:59] <GuyverTypeL> Follow your heart pat
[2:30:00] <Coystick> Grissom gang got too cocky!
[2:30:00] <Jaysky> Wait, why academy first?
[2:30:01] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Get javik now or you will miss javik dialouge
[2:30:02] <%Woodywoo0100> Just do academy first
[2:30:04] <tanarath> Ac@my
[2:30:05] <peachy996> Chat knows the N7 Missions are irrelevant
[2:30:06] <%TheYellowcouch> Good thing about not having played this is I never have to fear being the one guy
[2:30:07] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Missions disappear when you do too many MAIN missions. Academy is not a main mission.
[2:30:08] <%unstablebeast19> all those in any order works, up to you oat
[2:30:09] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just do Grissom first, it's on a time limit and doesn't affect future quest timings
[2:30:12] <%demiiluna> Just save and do what you want lol
[2:30:12] <%BlackStarAura> Grissom is CLUTCH
[2:30:12] <%Ranryu692> Grissom sticks around for a while, chat is stupid
[2:30:14] <peachy996> That's why they're going nuts
[2:30:14] <%castlerock42> I've taken Javik to Grissom.
[2:30:14] <%unstablebeast19> pat*
[2:30:17] <%Garthunox> i'd do grissom after javik just to be safe
[2:30:17] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Get Javik now or you miss things with him.
[2:30:18] <kingdinkyI> Academy first
[2:30:20] <dawarw0lf> GRISSIMLM FAILS AFTER TUNCHKAA
[2:30:23] <+DracosMagala> Eden first
[2:30:23] <ahaegotrigger> Go to Grissom for the Matlock
[2:30:24] <+AmericanSkidd> IGNORE CHAT
[2:30:24] <+Ches_Neckbeard> guide is wrong because Grissom has a 3 mission timer
[2:30:26] <GuilKato> grissom first
[2:30:28] <tanarath> Academy first or 2nd
[2:30:29] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt We're building a consensus
[2:30:29] <%Eaglestrike117> Just get Javik then do Grissom
[2:30:31] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna Doing grissom then eden prime would mess up nothing
[2:30:32] <Sunstalker> Go pet Gief more D:
[2:30:32] <%snugglepuggs> It’s like Normandy crew from ME2
[2:30:33] <MarylandJutsu> just do whaever works Pat
[2:30:33] <+akscully> do eden then grissom
[2:30:33] <dawarw0lf> Guys the guide is fine. There is no time limit
[2:30:33] <+skyheys> GET ANGRY
[2:30:34] <%hatok> Javik is anomalous because he was DLC
[2:30:35] <@commanderclaw> Chill guys
[2:30:36] <Doomstar16> Sounds like a plan.
[2:30:36] <PaperyHornet1013> Citadel first
[2:30:36] <tattleworm> you have to do grissom before priority citadel 2, that's all
[2:30:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> i like video games
[2:30:39] <available_line> Grissom is the only quest that's time sensitive. I'd do it now just to be sure. After this ,you don't need to be scared anymore.
[2:30:41] <@commanderclaw> This isn't the end of the world
[2:30:41] <mr_saturday93> CALM DOWN? NEVER
[2:30:42] <falyden> Break Dance!!!
[2:30:42] <blackjack8182> Javik!
[2:30:45] <+denizen_conspirator> I will not calm down!
[2:30:45] <%Ranryu692> It's Priority: Tuchanka that locks out missions
[2:30:46] <%QueequegTheater> Poll time
[2:30:47] <+denizen_conspirator> lol
[2:30:49] <falyden> KomodoHype
[2:30:50] <$Futurecity10> Honestly you should have gotten Javik first
[2:30:50] <ShinyVagikarp> LUL
[2:30:56] <Coystick> We are chat for we are many
[2:30:56] <%capnbeefs> Do a poll
[2:30:57] <%Rumbutt> Does that make chat Shitty Legion?
[2:30:57] <peachy996> You can get Grissom Academy done first or Javik first. Either one work
[2:30:57] <MarylandJutsu> no queequeg
[2:30:57] <%Garthunox> then follow the guide, ignore us
[2:30:58] <+theCatastrophy> hell yeah javik!
[2:30:58] <mattynezz> I think since Javic is DLC it doesn't take "time"
[2:31:00] <KeystoneA2> That works too. But then do the Academy.
[2:31:02] <MarylandJutsu> thats dangeourus
[2:31:03] <Mattais88> Everyone agrres with Javik
[2:31:04] <GuyverTypeL> JAVIK YEEEEEEEEEEEAH
[2:31:05] <+AmericanSkidd> oh no chat is the Geth Collective confirmed
[2:31:05] <%TheYellowcouch> I sudenly got a much bigger respect for Legion
[2:31:06] <%lloyddboy> GRISSOM IS TIMED BUT NOT THAT TIMED
[2:31:06] <%jillyrancher> I do Javik almost immediately after Palaven cause yay more squadmates
[2:31:06] <Zombrocom> Oh god, is chat just a geth?
[2:31:09] <peachy996> It will be fine
[2:31:12] <GuilKato> if only there was some sort of vote technology in twitch to allow for consensus
[2:31:13] <%jillyrancher> YEAH
[2:31:13] <+skyheys> No BabyRage
[2:31:14] <dawarw0lf> Academy fails after citadel 2. It doesn’t have a mission time limit
[2:31:15] <Zombrocom> Are we just a gestalt mind?
[2:31:15] <Zebroneath> Everything will be fine
[2:31:15] <blackjack8182> Yes
[2:31:16] <falyden> javlick
[2:31:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Grissom only fails if you do Priority: The Citadel II before doing it, according to the wiki
[2:31:18] <studleydoorite> calming down pisses me off
[2:31:21] <MarylandJutsu> Chat was Legion all along
[2:31:22] <SaltyAzteca> @Rumbutt We were the Legion all along
[2:31:22] <%jillyrancher> Consensus achieved
[2:31:25] <peachy996> Scan
[2:31:25] <+Ches_Neckbeard> oh god no
[2:31:28] <+athuramn> !changetitle - chat trolls streamer playing ME3 with bad advice
[2:31:31] <mr_saturday93> Grissum academy isn't like the final mission in ME2
[2:31:35] <Wolfstriker121> HAHAH
[2:31:36] <tuesti> LUL
[2:31:38] <KeystoneA2> Scan Gemmae for buttloads of fuel
[2:31:39] <+skyheys> lmaoooo

[2:31:46] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:31:46] <@commanderclaw> This is some clown shoes shit
[2:31:47] <%QueequegTheater> JUST RUN
[2:31:48] <PaperyHornet1013> You can visit the citadel and talk to people
[2:31:48] <%ahomeschooldropout> yea mang
[2:31:50] <%QueequegTheater> RUN
[2:31:51] <%gliph13> get f*** naysayers!
[2:31:54] <%coward_man> there is also a second hidden timer for chatacters in the mission to die
[2:31:54] <%Mr_Pylon> it's really funny to see chat explode every time Pat says he's gonna do a thing
[2:31:54] <%QueequegTheater> RUN AWAY
[2:31:55] <%jillyrancher> Fuck you consensus achvied program #1569!
[2:31:58] <MarylandJutsu> Gief does not like chat arguing
[2:31:59] <%Ranryu692> there was a fuel depot in that system
[2:32:00] <%somekindofsam> It's Priority:Tuchunka
[2:32:02] <%ahomeschooldropout> na man
[2:32:04] <SaltyAzteca> Damn you run out of fuel really fast
[2:32:04] <Mattais88> Nah javik is in system
[2:32:05] <28moogles> There was a fuel deposit right there though
[2:32:06] <Zombrocom> We Are Legion
[2:32:07] <%DrTomT18> visit kaiden
[2:32:11] <dawarw0lf> Go down I your current system
[2:32:11] <stoatacious> EGG
[2:32:12] <28moogles> not much
[2:32:12] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Might as well visit Kaiden while you're at it
[2:32:13] <+skyheys> SPEND MONEY
[2:32:13] <%Ranryu692> are you out of money?
[2:32:14] <%TheYellowcouch> This is a great mechanic
[2:32:15] <DatAsuna> you have infinite money
[2:32:17] <%QueequegTheater> You get infinite money later
[2:32:18] <peachy996> You are now at the point where chat argues about mission order
[2:32:19] <KeystoneA2> the trip to Gemmae is like 250 fuel
[2:32:20] <%weissguard> You have plenty.
[2:32:22] <Daebunz> then yeah you can do it that way its just time consuming
[2:32:23] <xcompleasedad> Fuck it. Risk the Academy.
[2:32:24] <+akscully> 1500 credits
[2:32:24] <@commanderclaw> Pat, it's nothing, you get infinite money later
[2:32:25] <%jillyrancher> No data available.
[2:32:25] <dawarw0lf> The system under you had fuel
[2:32:26] <%Ranryu692> there's plenty of money in this game
[2:32:27] <KeystoneA2> Fill up that much then take off
[2:32:27] <+fetrigon> just buy more money PunOko PunOko PunOko
[2:32:29] <+condemned_15> spend money. you can get more
[2:32:30] <%unstablebeast19> scanning, usually each system has a wreckage that'll give you fuel
[2:32:33] <%Ranryu692> it's a pittance
[2:32:34] <%Garthunox> no, buy fuel at your location
[2:32:36] <stoatacious> it's like nothig broski
[2:32:38] <%Garthunox> ITS PENNIES!
[2:32:39] <Profmcstevie> Pat stop walking 5 miles for a free refill just pay
[2:32:42] <DatAsuna> "we have mcdonalds at home"
[2:32:42] <dekkitout> Just make more monis
[2:32:42] <kingdinkyI> Just cheat the money
[2:32:45] <%Solid_Stro> Money Number Go Down
[2:32:48] <@commanderclaw> "But what if I need this buck fifty later?"
[2:32:52] <thetunnelhomer> Money in a game like this is kinda nuts.
[2:32:58] <%TheYellowcouch> Max Reapo
[2:33:01] <+AmericanSkidd> omg if you count everyone viewing the stream we dont even come close to one Legion platform
[2:33:09] <%TheYellowcouch> too dummy thicc
[2:33:12] <GustauveVIII> You can scan new systems for fuel. When you're full, you can save the them for later.
[2:33:21] <thetunnelhomer> Like, the world is ending by the minute and people are still worried about the economy.
[2:33:22] <%The_Protagonist> delicious delicious radar juices
[2:33:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> you can pick up items for sidequests before you get the quest
[2:33:27] <GuyverTypeL> "With creddits you cam buy many peanuts"
[2:33:30] <dawarw0lf> The issue with the infinite money is it won’t be till the very near end of the game and you have to grind for it for a while
[2:33:30] <OldManDeckardCain> reapers are following shepard on spacebook
[2:33:32] <SaltyAzteca> D:
[2:33:33] <Thepothero> @PatStaresAt Its turain shit

[2:34:26] <ShinyVagikarp> Cheese successful
[2:34:32] <OldManDeckardCain> man, is this a jar jar abrams film? could have fooled me with that stupid sound
[2:34:39] <SaltyAzteca> You....did it
[2:34:41] <@commanderclaw> Those reapers are all "Swiggity Swooty, I'm coming for that booty"
[2:34:42] <Daebunz> the reapers never expected that
[2:34:42] <Mattais88> Reapers love Dubstep
[2:34:48] <MarylandJutsu> you diiiiiiid it
[2:34:50] <28moogles> scanning is fun, i don't get the complaints
[2:34:57] <+condemned_15> straight up Benny Hill those Reapers
[2:34:59] <Doomstar16> I already don't believe it.
[2:35:01] <%Dopamien> reapers chasing you on the galaxy map is so fucking silly calebKek
[2:35:08] <Thepothero> We do a little reaper evading :tf:
[2:35:11] <Profmcstevie> Reapers getting outpaced in a modern ship when they're hyper advanced millennia old is HILARIOUS
[2:35:11] <GuyverTypeL> Live grinding! yeeeeeah
[2:35:14] <kjb343> no Kappa
[2:35:17] <televisedrevolting> Pat did that one DLC that probably should've been in the main game right?
[2:35:18] <peachy996> The Reapers threat is not presented well with scanning
[2:35:18] <%Treuan> Ehhh
[2:35:19] <%TheYellowcouch> that's debatable
[2:35:19] <falyden> weeeeee
[2:35:20] <+akscully> well
[2:35:24] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:35:25] <MarylandJutsu> I want elmo to scan planets instead
[2:35:26] <%ohno778> you can get over 8k war assets i believe
[2:35:27] <+condemned_15> have a fun - Pat
[2:35:29] <%SaiyanShoto> ehhhhhhhh
[2:35:31] <DianaTheAscian> ehhhhhhhh
[2:35:33] <Blank9> if only you could listen to codecs while doing this
[2:35:34] <OldManDeckardCain> you know what is boring? evo this year LUL
[2:35:34] <%miguelrod777> you sure about that *john Cena meme*
[2:35:40] <%The_Protagonist> psaDogchamp
[2:35:48] <dawarw0lf> It’s Almost like you don’t need to buy fuel ever
[2:35:48] <GustauveVIII> 4000 war assets is the minimum you need for max choice at the end
[2:35:53] <DatAsuna> yes you can get more than enough to best ending it easily
[2:36:00] <murdocismyhero> woof
[2:36:03] <%QueequegTheater> BARK
[2:36:06] <%The_Protagonist> BORF
[2:36:08] <MarylandJutsu> Gief no like Hades Gamma
[2:36:11] <dekkitout> That's right Gief
[2:36:17] <$Ziegsy> what happens if the BWAA catches you?
[2:36:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt You need 7,400 War Assets for the secret Red ending, but only 5,400 for the good Blue and Red ending, and around 6k for the Green ending
[2:36:31] <%The_Protagonist> Gief is spacist
[2:36:31] <mattynezz> Some clusters troop later in the game
[2:36:31] <+AmericanSkidd> he hates it
[2:36:33] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Gief does not like big night time
[2:36:34] <MarylandJutsu> @Ziegsy instant game over
[2:36:35] <%Treuan> Gief fears the big night time
[2:36:35] <dawarw0lf> Credits or war assets
[2:36:36] <Profmcstevie> If the BWAA get you it's a fade to black game over
[2:36:44] <Daebunz> you reload at that cluster
[2:36:52] <$Ziegsy> @MarylandJutsu really? harsh.
[2:36:56] <Profmcstevie> Gief you can't stop the reapers stop barkin
[2:37:08] <+AmericanSkidd> the big brain am winning
[2:37:19] <peachy996> this messes with your mind goblins
[2:37:22] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[2:37:26] <%Treuan> Rain kills reapers, you heard it here first
[2:37:28] <KeystoneA2> like Glados and birds?
[2:37:32] <Profmcstevie> "What is this....new life form"
[2:37:35] <OldManDeckardCain> imagine gief chasing a reaper
[2:37:36] <%hatok> reapers spare humanity because they don't want to destroy dogs
[2:37:37] <%hewlettfan96> Damn you stream too much
[2:37:41] <%Varlinator> they'd probably shit themselves if they saw Clifford
[2:37:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt You think birds just sit on top of Reapers and shit on them. Do the reapers get mad?
[2:37:44] <Mattais88> Reaper sees a dog and decides Fuck Humanity, that will be the next reaper
[2:37:44] <televisedrevolting> The Reapers can't tell the difference between dogs and loaves of bread.
[2:37:48] <Profmcstevie> Does the wild variance in organic life frighten ancient machines
[2:37:55] <%jillyrancher> Reaper Space Cow
[2:37:55] <%greasypete00> ????
[2:38:00] <$Ziegsy> its almost like its his job
[2:38:04] <%Solid_Stro> Dog Reaper Cometh
[2:38:04] <SilverFaustX> one guy
[2:38:04] <DatAsuna> >not streaming 24 hours
[2:38:05] <%The_Protagonist> what is a stream, is it a food?
[2:38:06] <dawarw0lf> You stream enough
[2:38:06] <tuesti> Pat: Buy my silence
[2:38:09] <%TheYellowcouch> the most one guy there's ever been
[2:38:09] <xcompleasedad> Define too much LUL
[2:38:10] <MarylandJutsu> can you leave?
[2:38:11] <peachy996> That's a great way to come in.
[2:38:12] <+akscully> no
[2:38:13] <%jillyrancher> THIS HURTS ME SHEPARD
[2:38:14] <Profmcstevie> He streams every day but weekends usually and podcast day
[2:38:14] <Coystick> Stream your sleep you COWARD
[2:38:16] <Minorou> "I found you, now you work for me, Shepard"
[2:38:19] <Laecerelius> Woof
[2:38:20] <TioXyco> we all will eventually
[2:38:22] <dekkitout> Perhaps, likely
[2:38:23] <SaltyAzteca> Nailed it
[2:38:24] <MarylandJutsu> phew JUST made it
[2:38:27] <peachy996> I should come in one day and says "Stop Streaming."
[2:38:31] <@commanderclaw> Nah, you just call a space tow truck
[2:38:33] <GustauveVIII> Scan new systems for fuel
[2:38:35] <%jillyrancher> utopia
[2:38:37] <+akscully> you literally just auto return to the relay system
[2:38:42] <Kat_k> if you run out of gas it just sends you back to the system with the relay
[2:38:47] <+AmericanSkidd> probably
[2:38:48] <Meekest> Yeah sure whatever
[2:38:49] <Mattais88> Nothing in this one
[2:38:53] <DatAsuna> pat really about to fly by the academy and not do the mission lol
[2:38:55] <xcompleasedad> """"Yes""""
[2:38:58] <studleydoorite> ugh space tow trucks always take 5 light years to get to you
[2:39:02] <MarylandJutsu> gief no like reapies
[2:39:07] <Profmcstevie> Don't destroy those rings with your fat ship
[2:39:08] <xcompleasedad> It's convenience
[2:39:09] <dekkitout> Space AAA is pretty reliable in these trying times
[2:39:12] <supergoblinpunch> Call your Dad to pick you up
[2:39:14] <%Ranryu692> @patstaresat there aren't reapers in any map spot that only has one system
[2:39:14] <+condemned_15> Anus Basin
[2:39:22] <GustauveVIII> no
[2:39:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> Light year is a unit of distance
[2:39:24] <%shurtal> Nope
[2:39:25] <%Ranryu692> no
[2:39:26] <KeystoneA2> no
[2:39:26] <Mattais88> no
[2:39:27] <%QueequegTheater> No
[2:39:30] <%Ranryu692> you have to land
[2:39:36] <MarylandJutsu> nah you have to clck on the specific planet
[2:40:02] <%AzureGale> Ass-fuel depot
[2:40:07] <dawarw0lf> Question. What does pat even need credits for? He no use weapon so far.
[2:40:11] <MarylandJutsu> riveting
[2:40:13] <zhenthrim213> very
[2:40:13] <@commanderclaw> Mmm, delicious tasty resources
[2:40:21] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The second one is south of the mass relay
[2:40:21] <FlyguyJP> I am so excited.
[2:40:25] <%TheYellowcouch> A rainy day
[2:40:26] <mr_saturday93> to buy shit
[2:40:26] <TheYellowcouch> in space
[2:40:27] <+AmericanSkidd> to be RICH
[2:40:28] <Doomstar16> You always need something in a video game so it's better to grind it out early.
[2:40:28] <dawarw0lf> You do space magic
[2:40:30] <%BlackStarAura> Lol
[2:40:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> The Credits are for the guns.
[2:40:32] <GuilKato> to buy all the guns
[2:40:33] <hat_under_bread> He needs them tho
[2:40:33] <%Ranryu692> upgrading your guns gets expensivw
[2:40:34] <MarylandJutsu> MORE $$$
[2:40:36] <@commanderclaw> There are cool guns you need money for, and Pat loves being a completionist
[2:40:41] <%sniffy77> Pat are your mind goblins holding you hostage until you scan the entire map?
[2:40:41] <Profmcstevie> Better to have and not need
[2:40:42] <%AzureGale> Gotta upgrade those weapons
[2:40:44] <dawarw0lf> Guns he won’t be using?
[2:40:50] <+alphonseisbest> why  not just cheat ur way to max creadits
[2:40:52] <dekkitout> It's the fuzz- cheese it

[2:41:20] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You should read the planets of these systems, I believe this is the Volus homeworld cluster
[2:41:20] <%Solid_Stro> rossdrawsMiloboop
[2:41:23] <+akscully> remember that more systems open up within the clusters as the story progresses
[2:41:26] <MarylandJutsu> no we're jealous that you have elmo and gief
[2:41:26] <Doomstar16> It's so fun to collect random things honestly.
[2:41:27] <dawarw0lf> It takes hours of hours of grinding credits to buy everything. He will be there forever if he wants everything.
[2:41:40] <%TheYellowcouch> That's way easier to pronounce in swedish
[2:41:44] <FlyguyJP> Sounds like something that requires a cream to heal
[2:41:50] <KeystoneA2> That's what save editors are for

[2:42:05] <DatAsuna> but it will take mods because of NG+ items
[2:42:06] <%king_wragles> If only there was a way for Pat to go pee and just HAPPEN to have all the credits needed

[2:42:32] <Profmcstevie> Mashing scan as reapers chase you is such a petty and goofy visual

[2:43:17] <%SaiyanShoto> Why big word when small word just as good?
[2:43:19] <dawarw0lf> You need over 2 million credits to get everything. The game gives about half of that not counting the infinite credit source.
[2:43:28] <Alzero83> You having a stroke?
[2:43:35] <%Aeoneth> Paige Sundowns, and Pat Sat Downs
[2:43:42] <$Ziegsy> Pats english is failing, he needs to switch to french and let it recharge

[2:43:44] <+Scevda> Sleep deprivation? Sertraline? For some reason my meds kills my vocab as well
[2:43:56] <%Ranryu692> @patstaresat the guns only upgrade to level 5 in your first playthrough, and level 10 in NG+  is that going to cause you problems?
[2:43:57] <peachy996> rejects well thought out sentences, long live nonsense words
[2:43:58] <dawarw0lf> You gotta grind around 700k in the “thing” that gives 10k each time.
[2:44:22] <PaperyHornet1013> We’re really only going to get one story mission per stream
[2:44:25] <+Scevda> @ranryu692 probs
[2:44:33] <$Ziegsy> @Scevda Oh man, sertraline made my brain super dumb. I had to switch to quetiapine

[2:45:06] <+DracosMagala> Trying to 100% this game?
[2:45:06] <peachy996> N7 Missions are MP Maps
[2:45:13] <MarylandJutsu> so we doing N7 cerberus frist?
[2:45:22] <televisedrevolting> When is Pat going to do the thing on Eden Prime?
[2:45:30] <peachy996> It's not even the cool version of the Cereberus labs with the aactive seeker swarm
[2:45:30] <Profmcstevie> All the good stuff% run
[2:45:33] <PaperyHornet1013> No pat
[2:45:37] <%demiiluna> I think this game has a lot of mutually exclusive rewards though. What counts as 100%?
[2:45:39] <televisedrevolting> Oh thank god
[2:45:46] <MarylandJutsu> silllyyyy pat
[2:45:46] <Aiutare47> Does that include weapon upgrades?
[2:45:49] <$Ziegsy> @Scevda It makes you SUPER sleepy, I wouldnt recommend at all. Like it knocks you out for 12 hours straight
[2:45:49] <+Scevda> @peachy996 that shit is tough
[2:45:52] <GuyverTypeL> Do you trust that guide better than your trusty chat?

[2:46:12] <peachy996> @Scevda oh for sure but it is fun I can't deny
[2:46:13] <GustauveVIII> The Omega missions have missable content if you don't get it. It's the only mission where if you miss things, you can't get it back.
[2:46:13] <dawarw0lf> I would honestly pick and choose weapons from the specter terminal.
[2:46:13] <Aeroallways> imagine trusting chat
[2:46:16] <Profmcstevie> I will lie for fun
[2:46:16] <FlyguyJP> Chat NEVER lies
[2:46:19] <%ahomeschooldropout> The only thing I hate about javik is that I love him so much that I miss out with so much unique dialog because I literally never bench Javik

[2:46:30] <xcompleasedad> I trust him more than us, even though I THINK he is wrong
[2:46:31] <+Scevda> @demiiluna not that many actually. Many are illusions.

[2:46:33] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Eden Prime gives you a really cool gun

[2:47:42] <Profmcstevie> Garrus, Garrusa and THE WHOLE GARRUSON
[2:47:45] <$Ziegsy> @Scevda it does completely help my paranoia and anxiety though, it might be worth bringing it up to a doc about it.

[2:48:03] <SaltyAzteca> Garrus "Garrison" Vakarian
[2:48:06] <Sunstalker> Big Garrus Big Chungus
[2:48:07] <Laecerelius> The Bigger Garrus theory
[2:48:12] <dawarw0lf> It’s the havok armor in MP
[2:48:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> CHUNGRESS
[2:48:20] <%coward_man> fun fact: in ME2 if you're femshep romancing Garrus Mordin tells you not to swallow
[2:48:21] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna No, because those two characters weren't squadmates until ME3 and thus only have 1 game to be in.
[2:48:21] <ahaegotrigger> I cant believe you left the Robo Suck 9000 at home
[2:48:23] <%The_Protagonist> @SaltyAzteca Garrison Vakarrison
[2:48:31] <%jillyrancher> If Garrus is big and a bird that means hes a big cock
[2:48:32] <%Ranryu692> you should take Garrus's terminator look once, it looks great in mission
[2:48:37] <TioXyco> wait, vangard but no shotgun? what?!
[2:48:38] <peachy996> hey chat does this mission have any phantoms?
[2:48:45] <GuyverTypeL> ME1 squad yeeeeeeee
[2:48:49] <%jillyrancher> That's not my name Shepard
[2:48:50] <+akscully> buy him the black widow
[2:48:52] <SaltyAzteca> @the_protagonist thats funny LUL
[2:48:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @coward_man concidering that it causes an alergic reaction...no surprise
[2:48:53] <xcompleasedad> It's the M8, tho
[2:48:54] <%jillyrancher> A Liar
[2:48:58] <MarylandJutsu> its like ME 1 again
[2:49:00] <Aiutare47> It’s an m-8. M-7 is the lancer. Fake fan.
[2:49:00] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 No but it has almost everything else
[2:49:01] <%Ranryu692> @jillyrancher I thought you were going to say Big Bird, I was not prepared
[2:49:08] <+DracosMagala> @peachy996 no
[2:49:08] <televisedrevolting> Is Pat running that one Garrus build that kills everything?
[2:49:08] <DatAsuna> I don't think phantoms appear until citadel
[2:49:13] <%QueequegTheater> No
[2:49:13] <+galaktic> you did increase his sniper damage though
[2:49:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> NO
[2:49:14] <%Ranryu692> no
[2:49:15] <ahaegotrigger> Eh
[2:49:15] <GustauveVIII> You can switch his guns in combat
[2:49:16] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf ok
[2:49:17] <dawarw0lf> You can’t.
[2:49:22] <GuilKato> never take away garrus's sniper rifle
[2:49:23] <%jillyrancher> Yeah not until Citadel
[2:49:23] <ahaegotrigger> hes still good with Snipers
[2:49:23] <+AmericanSkidd> no reason not to have a sniper
[2:49:24] <+OneGorillionDollars> you can choose what weapons they use
[2:49:30] <Mattais88> You can choose squad weapons in the same menu as for yourself
[2:49:32] <DatAsuna> He uses whatever you tell him to
[2:49:32] <+akscully> you can switch guns in combat
[2:49:32] <%jillyrancher> nemesis appear though
[2:49:33] <%coward_man> @doc_ock_rokc yeah but I wasn't prepared for him to say that
[2:49:33] <GuilKato> one of his powers is based on sniper rifle
[2:49:33] <tattleworm> he should be context sensitive and switch accordingly
[2:49:36] <TioXyco> it only means he specializes in closer gun battles
[2:49:36] <%QueequegTheater> Just tell him to use the rifle
[2:49:36] <Profmcstevie> If he has no loss from carrying it, why get rid of it
[2:49:37] <%ahomeschooldropout> They won't switch weapons unless you tell them to
[2:49:37] <godila2> you choose it
[2:49:39] <+akscully> weight doesn't affect squaddies
[2:49:43] <+CyanDeadEye> Garrus isn't really used for his powers
[2:49:50] <+Scevda> Squaddies always have two.
[2:49:51] <DatAsuna> Does pat understand power detonation?
[2:49:53] <+CyanDeadEye> Just hid godlike weapon damage
[2:49:56] <%jillyrancher> squadmates arent affected by weight Pat
[2:50:05] <%dooscent> eden prime, home. 'least it was before i fucked everything up.
[2:50:06] <%jillyrancher> turn off the helmets Pat lol
[2:50:08] <DatAsuna> He's missing out on big charge multipliers otherwise
[2:50:12] <DSD24> Garrus looks nice
[2:50:12] <blackjack8182> I cannot believe this was DLC.
[2:50:14] <$Ziegsy> liara putting on that mask because she knows shepherds into masks
[2:50:14] <%Eaglestrike117> Did you not go check out all your new armour?
[2:50:15] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna Not really

[2:50:26] <+Alig200> @jillyrancher he has them off for conversations
[2:50:32] <Jane_Lo> i personally like the black-pink outfit of liara
[2:50:33] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah turns out we missed something bigger than a beacon
[2:50:34] <+Scevda> Her main is worse imo
[2:50:37] <dekkitout> Missing Jenkins right now
[2:50:39] <MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt we should call it Elmo Prime
[2:50:41] <DracaenaLeaf> Garrus's mouth got restored?
[2:50:43] <peachy996> Only instead of Ash and Kaiden you have better Garrus
[2:50:45] <FlyguyJP> The PAPERWORK
[2:50:48] <Profmcstevie> FUCKING PAPERWORK, I WANNA SHOOT
[2:50:58] <DSD24> Liara wearing cool armor is better then her default look
[2:51:03] <Laecerelius> Man Eden Prime just gets constantly fucked over
[2:51:06] <DSD24> She's more blue here
[2:51:06] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf You think a quad damage bonus isn't significant?
[2:51:08] <MarylandJutsu> oh yeah liara looks great
[2:51:13] <%AzureGale> They killed every last one of them
[2:51:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> except for that elbow texture, back to omicron with you

[2:51:41] <+fetrigon> what part?
[2:51:42] <Mattais88> It's really wierd
[2:51:44] <DSD24> Ain't that the truth
[2:51:46] <FlyguyJP> Yeah. ME3 is full of inconsistant quality
[2:51:46] <Laecerelius> OH YEAH
[2:51:46] <Profmcstevie> There's still time to piss you off, big game
[2:51:50] <@commanderclaw> It's some peak EA bullshit
[2:51:50] <%sniffy77> Yeah I thought this game was really fun except... that part.
[2:51:50] <Jane_Lo> being on THE DISK
[2:51:51] <Aiutare47> Yeah…
[2:51:52] <%Ranryu692> definitely
[2:51:52] <%NocturneNovember> DAY ONE DLC, EVEN
[2:51:52] <MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt DAY ONE DLC TOO
[2:51:52] <+Scevda> YUP
[2:51:53] <+AmericanSkidd> pay for it you fucks
[2:51:53] <%demiiluna> Day one DLC
[2:51:56] <xcompleasedad> It's an 11/10 game that becomes a 9/10 because of the one aprt
[2:51:57] <godila2> true
[2:51:57] <Laecerelius> It was during the time of cutting out content for pre-order bonuses
[2:51:58] <Aeroallways> day 1 dlc at that if I remember right
[2:51:59] <xcompleasedad> part
[2:52:00] <%coward_man> thiss game is GREAT up until the 98% mark
[2:52:01] <+cermo55> I know right, even if it was day 1
[2:52:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Kinda why people are so pissed off pat. A bad ending poisions your last impressions
[2:52:04] <ne0bunny> pre-order was it?
[2:52:06] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> It should have been base game content
[2:52:06] <%LeiaSkynoober> I'm so sad :c I couldn't get it ever
[2:52:07] <williamrooster> If Garrus had to sign his name he’d call it tyranny
[2:52:07] <SaltyAzteca> @fetrigon When you see it. You'll know.
[2:52:07] <KaiserMario> Funny, you don't sound outraged
[2:52:07] <%CalderGaming> @fetrigon the ending
[2:52:11] <%Ranryu692> I wasn't mad at the time because I was buying the season pass regardless, but it's definitely fucked
[2:52:12] <DSD24> Aww yeah Background line
[2:52:12] <%VictorVonLouche> one the disk dlc
[2:52:13] <Sunstalker> The era of ea's on disc preorder collecters edition content
[2:52:15] <Zombrocom> Seriously this game is like 90% fantastic, but oh boy that 10%
[2:52:15] <FlyguyJP> Super obviously removed from main game to add as DLC
[2:52:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't hear shepard, i hear Batman, help me
[2:52:18] <peachy996> the classic music too
[2:52:20] <MrPandastic> Yeah Javik being day one dlc was insulting.
[2:52:28] <dekkitout> Battarians do deserve it
[2:52:28] <+condemned_15> hard and dirty Kappa
[2:52:32] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf damage scaling on combos uses a scaling multiplier that goes up to a max of 4.3 times the sum of the 2 powers used to make it
[2:52:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Someone already said this, but make sure you also look for every single PC in this mission.
[2:52:37] <%jillyrancher> Its pretty
[2:52:50] <MarylandJutsu> Eden prime sure is pretty
[2:52:51] <TheMostAverageGamer4> a peaceful eden prime
[2:52:53] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Is Eden Prime toxic now?
[2:52:54] <DatAsuna> ME3 math is busted and using combos correctly is huge damage multiplier
[2:52:56] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc exactly
[2:53:02] <+AmericanSkidd> yo shepard just talked about HIMSELF thats crazy
[2:53:02] <Meekest> Naboo ass planet
[2:53:04] <Profmcstevie> Looks nicer when it's not in ME1
[2:53:09] <%demiiluna> People keep saying Javik was obviously removed from the main game, except his actual impact on the game is super anciliary
[2:53:13] <MarylandJutsu> mmmmm money
[2:53:16] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna Ummm….I know that. I think your meant to be  responding  to someone else
[2:53:23] <GuyverTypeL> Remember when the sky was blood red in ME1? lol
[2:53:25] <$Ziegsy> I thought the vaulted eden prime, Mind you ive not played warframe in a wile
[2:53:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Getting some Subnautica vibes from those shelters, from the outside
[2:53:32] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Pat check out the secondary codexes after you kill new Cerberus enemies, they all have codex entries about them
[2:53:48] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf you replied to me with a question mark, implying it was a question
[2:53:52] <%jillyrancher> Cerberus is awful lol
[2:53:53] <Jane_Lo> @demiiluna sure, but that's still bad that such character is DLC, this is like da2 and sebastian all over again
[2:53:59] <+Scevda> @demiiluna once again pat has already explained the distinction
[2:54:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda Look at Game of Thrones or Starwars
[2:54:13] <MarylandJutsu> Its like Cerberus is a TERRIBLE ORGANIZATIN
[2:54:13] <%lloyddboy> cerberus is badong
[2:54:14] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> I thought Eden had breathable air?
[2:54:15] <FlyguyJP> You don't say.
[2:54:17] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna Sorry I was confused on why you were responding to me about it
[2:54:17] <%dooscent> powerful opinions about the space racists
[2:54:17] <Aiutare47> Bad guys.
[2:54:17] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember at the end of ME2 they only had 150 operatives?
[2:54:17] <+Goraka91> War crimes Cerberus? That one?
[2:54:18] <tanarath> might want to find the 3ish other bits of intel.
[2:54:22] <Zombrocom> Cerberus is cartoon evil
[2:54:27] <Profmcstevie> ME2 "maybe not ALL bad" ME3 "haha you fool I'm an ultra villain"
[2:54:28] <%jillyrancher> it's like Cerberus were always awful
[2:54:32] <%Mr_Pylon> didn't Cerberus have a pretty small roster in ME2, like a few hundred?
[2:54:32] <%TheYellowcouch> You really expect better from terrorists smh
[2:54:36] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc amazing I got to see all three in full fall apart in my lifetime
[2:54:36] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf because you replied to me??
[2:54:39] <%gliph13> all for humanity, right?
[2:54:45] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Nerd!
[2:54:45] <Alzero83> but they brought you back so you cant completely hate them LUL

[2:54:53] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:54:54] <Dangan12> is this the javik quest?
[2:54:56] <+cermo55> Cerberus M2: "Morally Grey"                 Cerberus M3: FULL EVIL
[2:54:57] <%jillyrancher> Dense Liara
[2:54:57] <FlyguyJP> Cerberus in ME2 was morally grey, doing heinous shit but for clear reasons. ME3 Cerberus is just cartoonishly evil.
[2:54:58] <MarylandJutsu> NERDDDDD
[2:55:02] <DSD24> Yes
[2:55:02] <AngryAsian5> Camaraderie!
[2:55:02] <MarylandJutsu> yes dangan
[2:55:03] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna I responded to saying pat doesn’t no the big combo that was it
[2:55:04] <Profmcstevie> Get dunked on nerds

[2:55:28] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf You pinged me, and I just hit reply on the message I was pinged in, so
[2:55:30] <%Ranryu692> This game is worth playing multiple times just to take everyone on every mission
[2:55:35] <SaltyAzteca> A CAFFIN
[2:55:37] <FlyguyJP> HERE COMES THE SPLOOSH
[2:55:37] <peachy996> i thought the same though
[2:55:44] <MarylandJutsu> HA you wish garrus
[2:55:50] <+CyanDeadEye> James's comment to Liara is that he wasn't joking. He genuinely wanted to know because he likes Dinosaurs.
[2:55:57] <+D00msDayDan> @DatAsuna @dawarw0lf you two done yet?
[2:56:03] <$Ziegsy> Oh I LOVE the ps3!
[2:56:03] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna It’s fine. I  hope Pat does the big combo tho.
[2:56:06] <%jillyrancher> It's also worth remembering Cerberus are using Reaper technology on thier own troopers. Wonder how they've avoided indoctrination. unless....
[2:56:14] <KeystoneA2> An asari-prothean child would be so OP
[2:56:18] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt James tells Liara he wasn't joking, he actually wanted to learn about the dinosaurs
[2:56:18] <DatAsuna> @D00msDayDan never
[2:56:20] <+AmericanSkidd> imagine finding him in ME1
[2:56:20] <Sunstalker> DRINK THE PROTHEAN SARCOPHOGI JUICE
[2:56:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda Its going to continue sadly because people are more intrested in pushing propaganda then making a fun story
[2:56:25] <%JohnAtDawn> HEHEHEHEHE UPLIFT RIGHT

[2:57:15] <dekkitout> Or- some guy
[2:57:16] <peachy996> Wisest Councilor Scientist
[2:57:17] <Zombrocom> Oh girl
[2:57:20] <Profmcstevie> Or a gang leader
[2:57:21] <ahaegotrigger> its so funny that Protheans turn out to be Space Nazis
[2:57:22] <+ALazo> he was the best at doing the shooty bangs
[2:57:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> Or he could be a fucking Janitor.
[2:57:25] <available_line> But he can be the best character.
[2:57:28] <+AmericanSkidd> Retroactively kicked out of university LUL
[2:57:30] <%QueequegTheater> OH NO HE'S A PROTHEAN REDDITOR
[2:57:32] <KeystoneA2> like how you can hear the snipers in the background before they show up
[2:57:34] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc i disagree on the incompetence/malevolence spectrum but the end result is still frustrating to endure
[2:57:36] <+akscully> like saying a parent is like their kid rather than the kid is like the parent
[2:57:37] <+vaderxyz1970> What if Javik was the Prothean equivalent of a useless drunk
[2:57:41] <+Alig200> ah that music.
[2:57:42] <dekkitout> The Phillip J Fry of Protheans
[2:57:43] <mar_krow> U know what they say about assumptions
[2:57:43] <hat_under_bread> Or the angriest motherfucker in the entire race
[2:57:45] <%Ranryu692> @queequegtheater LUL
[2:57:46] <blackjack8182> @ahaegotrigger Romans
[2:57:48] <+cermo55> spin
[2:57:50] <peachy996> Hey Liara what if he was the grumpiest bastard soldier ever known?
[2:57:51] <dawarw0lf> Fun fact: this mission changes based on when you do it. You can wait to do it all the way at the end but who wants to skip javik?
[2:57:52] <DSD24> Its Nemmy
[2:57:52] <FlyguyJP> @vaderxyz1970 I mean.....
[2:57:52] <notsoy> STARRRRS

[2:58:07] <FlyguyJP> Vanguard so fucking OP
[2:58:08] <+alphonseisbest> CHARGE
[2:58:09] <%jillyrancher> TAKING CASUALTIES
[2:58:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> Yea so doing this mission this early is kinda weird 'cause they introduce new enemy types that normally get their own special cutscene
[2:58:17] <%snugglepuggs> SSSSSSSHEPARD
[2:58:20] <dawarw0lf> I CANT WAIT UNTIL TURRET
[2:58:23] <%Ranryu692> yeah. its a sniper
[2:58:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Pat if a Roman historian stumbled upon a Roman centurion that is alive even if his word would COMPLETELY FUCK UP our history they would completely be behind it
[2:58:27] <Dangan12> yup vanguard was too much fun
[2:58:28] <peachy996> Nemesi are just pesky Snipers
[2:58:34] <peachy996> Oh the fuckin turrets lol
[2:58:35] <FlyguyJP> L O R E
[2:58:39] <%JohnAtDawn> Orgs
[2:58:40] <dawarw0lf> Main codex?
[2:58:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> The normal Codex.
[2:58:47] <%ojoesama> Oh boy, this game
[2:58:47] <Lancaster_H> as fun as vanguard was, it kinda breaks the game
[2:58:50] <nesbitt22> Phantom is the Ninja
[2:58:51] <peachy996> This is DLC
[2:58:51] <+Scevda> @ahomeschooldropout while trye its not too jarring
[2:58:54] <Dangan12> orgs?
[2:58:57] <%jillyrancher> organizations
[2:58:59] <peachy996> So maybe their entry doesn't show up yet
[2:59:06] <xcompleasedad> Secondary
[2:59:06] <%jillyrancher> secondary
[2:59:12] <%dooscent> secondary
[2:59:12] <%Ranryu692> you might not get it until you get their real introduction
[2:59:18] <%jillyrancher> It's the secondary Pat lol
[2:59:22] <xcompleasedad> Huh.
[2:59:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda Its not really incompetence or Malevolence when they state that its their goal. Its just agenda
[2:59:25] <xcompleasedad> Neat.
[2:59:26] <peachy996> oh secondary?
[2:59:31] <%jillyrancher> Pat why
[2:59:36] <xcompleasedad> Never mind
[2:59:39] <+AmericanSkidd> Having Cerberus here makes Surkesh really silly
[2:59:42] <%snugglepuggs> Nemesis are main game
[2:59:59] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc right, it comes in on analysis of intent behind an agenda.
[3:00:06] <%jillyrancher> theres an entry about the Battle of Palaven too
[3:00:10] <peachy996> crazy ones don't show up till later
[3:00:12] <dawarw0lf> Now one more
[3:00:16] <%coward_man> imagine being such a spacist you agree to having a bomb put inside you
[3:00:18] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There are only 3 laptops. You only need one more.

[3:01:56] <+RJay80> SHEPHERRRD
[3:01:57] <KeystoneA2> hard counter
[3:01:57] <@commanderclaw> Maybe use cover a little?
[3:01:58] <GustauveVIII> Heavy meleeing locks you in. Don't do it when you under fire.
[3:01:58] <samcast1> Garrus
[3:02:00] <djblue_shift> this mission made me hate turrets
[3:02:00] <+galaktic> those turrets are not to bef ucked with
[3:02:00] <dawarw0lf> @ttc_lover It was turned into dlc

[3:02:07] <tattleworm> turrets are another reason you probably want a shotgun
[3:02:08] <mar_krow> Fox fox foxxxxxx
[3:02:10] <%moonmintparadise> Pat, a gun is a ranged weapon
[3:02:12] <PaperyHornet1013> 2
[3:02:12] <Jaysky> I know you feel this, Shepard.
[3:02:13] <%gliph13> was that garrus fault too?
[3:02:14] <+Scevda> Stop running into turrts this isnt a tower defense game lol
[3:02:19] <+fetrigon> YOU CAN'T UNGA YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERYTHING
[3:02:20] <$realm_forge> Pat tries to 1v1 a turret “it’s Garrus’s fault”
[3:02:20] <Profmcstevie> Seems like it's time to get used to those squad abilities
[3:02:31] <dawarw0lf> Don’t charge turrets when others are around
[3:02:33] <%jillyrancher> Engineers are priorities or they'll make your life hell
[3:02:33] <+RowenCleric> man I miss the multiplayer
[3:02:42] <samcast1> Garrus!!!
[3:02:42] <+YabbaTroll> probably dont facefuck the turret
[3:02:43] <+Scevda> @profmcstevie he hates using the pause ability menu
[3:02:44] <$Futurecity10> Why would you shoot instead of biotic charge?
[3:02:45] <%QueequegTheater> Don't stand in front of the automatic turret
[3:02:45] <+akscully> please use overload
[3:02:46] <Jaysky> What if we melee'd the turret?
[3:02:47] <+Goraka91> BRRRRRT
[3:02:47] <peachy996> Bro turrets
[3:02:47] <%YakumoYomi> Nova leaves you with no shields
[3:02:48] <dawarw0lf> Avoid them if you can
[3:02:50] <%lloyddboy> stop dropping your shield pat
[3:02:50] <+RJay80> those turrets will kill your whole family in one second
[3:02:51] <4DLuvOfLuthy> dont mock the turrets lol
[3:02:51] <FlyguyJP> Turrets are the hard counter to Vanguard
[3:02:51] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, those turrets don't fuck around
[3:02:52] <Aiutare47> Having decent guns to fight your counters is important.
[3:02:52] <GustauveVIII> dont shoot keep charging
[3:02:54] <Lancaster_H> this is true unga were makin
[3:02:54] <xcompleasedad> Shotguns are NICE

[3:03:02] <tattleworm> you can circle strafe them sometimes but yeah
[3:03:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt stop novaing in front of a turret
[3:03:06] <+cermo55> Laughs in engineer
[3:03:07] <%Deebo305> Just eating those bullets like candy
[3:03:08] <+beansoup> biotic charge auto refills your shields. i spammed it whenever i could.

[3:03:13] <$realm_forge> USE COVER IN THE COVER SHOOTER
[3:03:13] <%jillyrancher> if you shoot thier backpacks they cant make anymore turrets
[3:03:20] <+D00msDayDan> hard counter deez nuts
[3:03:21] <Kat_k> well, that's what half blast nova is for
[3:03:21] <Sunstalker> Just shoot from cover or get overload
[3:03:22] <heartlesshealer> seeing a lot of chat about turrets. Did Pat stand still for 10 seconds?
[3:03:23] <+akscully> heal?
[3:03:27] <%jillyrancher> FUCK COVER BABY
[3:03:29] <DSD24> If you can't kill the turret in one go don't charge it
[3:03:34] <+kewlmyc> RIP
[3:03:37] <+akscully> maybe put it back on casual
[3:03:37] <peachy996> get fucked
[3:03:38] <samcast1> Garrus!!! Again!?!
[3:03:38] <%sniffy77> Pat u might need to do some shoot bang
[3:03:38] <%gliph13> yeah the Turrets need to go ASAP right after the engineers.
[3:03:41] <tattleworm> get a shotgun next time
[3:03:41] <%king_wragles> No cover is working great so far
[3:03:41] <Lancaster_H> THEN PERISH
[3:03:43] <TheMostAverageGamer4> no cover run
[3:03:43] <stantheman_97> you have no choice
[3:03:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda Intent? no results are what matter. The worst most egregious things mankind has ever done has been done with good intentions. And every other historical instance of a homogenic singular agenda taking over media always ends in a body count. Soviets, Nazis, Maoists, Castro's revolution the list is as long as the kill count
[3:03:43] <heartlesshealer> F
[3:03:43] <+zuzuxiv> "i dont wanna"
[3:03:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat when we say hard counter, what do you think that means?

[3:03:46] <+cermo55> Hell for vanguard, Engineer's best friend
[3:03:46] <%miguelrod777> pat do you know what cover is
[3:03:46] <Yrefe> Punished
[3:03:47] <FlyguyJP> Yeah those turrets are dunking on you

[3:03:48] <%EthorXL> WE ARE HARDCORE YAH BABY
[3:03:49] <mesamus> pat you actually will need to take cover
[3:03:49] <Dangan12> @FlyguyJP yeah they were a bitch in MP
[3:03:50] <Profmcstevie> .....Garrus this is still your fault
[3:03:51] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:03:52] <karl_rex> Then perish
[3:03:52] <Aiutare47> “Pat stop unga-ing your hard counter” “no”
[3:03:54] <+AmericanSkidd> easy mode is now selectable
[3:03:55] <g0d_zill4> that Nova skill seems not so good for crowds?
[3:03:56] <dawarw0lf> You need easy Mode?
[3:03:57] <Mattais88> Cover is for people who can't become afreight train with their minds
[3:03:58] <blackjack8182> What a shame
[3:03:58] <anAngryHamster> Stop DSPing it
[3:03:59] <4DLuvOfLuthy> the engineers can make new turrets if you let them live
[3:04:01] <+Chaos_Aether> Nope
[3:04:01] <%Deebo305> Nade
[3:04:01] <xcompleasedad> Every time you use cover, you survive. You abandon it, you DIE
[3:04:02] <PaperyHornet1013> Don’t wanna
[3:04:02] <$realm_forge> YOURE RIGHT PAT U GOT THIS
[3:04:04] <Daxalog> Maybe save on the ground pound and keep the shield?
[3:04:06] <%jillyrancher> Hit a turret with warp then charge for the detonation
[3:04:09] <Coystick> Just eat that grenade
[3:04:11] <%YakumoYomi> When you use Nova, you use up your shields. So then the turrets shred you
[3:04:13] <heartlesshealer> nah, they units
[3:04:26] <+condemned_15> brrrrrr
[3:04:26] <FlyguyJP> Engineers are slamming those things down
[3:04:28] <mar_krow> So many turrets let Garrus handle it
[3:04:31] <tigo0donnell> Stasis w/Liara is how I typically deal with turrets. Hit em with Stasis, biotic charge causing a detonation, then finish off
[3:04:36] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:04:36] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can cast warp on the turret with Liara. Charge the turret afterward for maximum damage.

[3:04:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Use Liara's Stasis on the turrets
[3:04:58] <PaperyHornet1013> 5
[3:04:59] <+beansoup> by the time you use nova your biotic charge is pretty much recharged.
[3:05:00] <+Chaos_Aether> Turret 3 Pat 0

[3:05:01] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt You can use medigel to heal, and also you don't need to use medigel to revive teammates, just walk up to them

[3:05:03] <Alzero83> Missing the CAIN yet @PatStaresAt Kappa
[3:05:04] <Kat_k> you can do some nonsense with half blast nova, since you are invincible during the animation, but yeah
[3:05:07] <%TheYellowcouch> If only you had some sort of tool that could fire projectiles from a far and safe distance
[3:05:08] <peachy996> vault right in front of it, that'll scare the turret
[3:05:09] <dawarw0lf> Have Garrus Overload them
[3:05:13] <KeystoneA2> having one button do like 5 things was a great design choice, wasn't it?
[3:05:14] <%QueequegTheater> Because it is
[3:05:15] <@commanderclaw> This is why those other abilities exist, like pull, for when you need to work tactically
[3:05:18] <peachy996> it is
[3:05:19] <$Futurecity10> Because this is super easy, you're just bad Kappa
[3:05:22] <%coward_man> wait you're on hardcore!?
[3:05:22] <dawarw0lf> Turrets are just that hard
[3:05:22] <xcompleasedad> HEAL BITCH
[3:05:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> Because it is.
[3:05:25] <FlyguyJP> Because you are WAY too aggressive
[3:05:25] <DatAsuna> Yes, hardcore is equal to silver difficulty on ME3 MP
[3:05:26] <samcast1> Okay, that's not your fault
[3:05:26] <+AmericanSkidd> AND YOU BELIEVED US
[3:05:27] <%Monkeyweed21> BECAUSE YOU ARE BaD
[3:05:29] <4DLuvOfLuthy> its just the turrets lol, they will delete you
[3:05:30] <+Qexec> it is. me2 normal is just undertuned
[3:05:31] <DSD24> This part on insanity is rough
[3:05:33] <Lancaster_H> its not if you dont facefuck sentries pat
[3:05:33] <CurrySauseBandit> A little tiny bit over breaddead yep.
[3:05:33] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You're bad at video games
[3:05:35] <djblue_shift> it's just the turrets, they're awful
[3:05:36] <tattleworm> this first encounter's tough but it's generally fine
[3:05:36] <%Chichen> BRRRRRRRRT
[3:05:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt This mission is a lot harder because they kinda want you to do it later, but fuck that
[3:05:38] <%Varlinator> Maybe you're just....
[3:05:39] <heartlesshealer> just stop using nova
[3:05:40] <Profmcstevie> The healing and the turrets are the only things hurting you
[3:05:40] <mar_krow> Just u pat
[3:05:43] <%Chichen> lmao the turrets are so fucking loud
[3:05:43] <$Futurecity10> This is brutal on insanity though
[3:05:48] <AngryAsian5> The Nova ability is also dropping your shields right in front of the turret
[3:05:48] <stormhawk9891> Because you keep trying to facetank turrets
[3:05:48] <%JohnAtDawn> This is only hard because you blow your shield spamming nova
[3:05:49] <+Krecart> Cerberus turrets are pure evil
[3:05:49] <PaperyHornet1013> Stop using nova every time
[3:05:50] <%YakumoYomi> I completely forgot you were on Hardcore
[3:05:53] <Profmcstevie> Also this is DLC pat, you don't know what they expect you to be
[3:05:54] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc you are misconstruing my words and position here. Ultimately going at it in such a dogmatic way will only entrench moderates further.
[3:05:55] <Blank9> you're spending all your shield on nova exclusively
[3:05:55] <%SaiyanShoto> because those people that said that are good at video games
[3:06:01] <Alzero83> Biotic Explosion is more damaging in this game then 2
[3:06:05] <%coward_man> is it Paige's turn with the brain today?
[3:06:05] <studleydoorite> I've never played ME but I think what's happening here is Pat is trying to play it like Warframe, is that right chat?
[3:06:06] <%sniffy77> his face asplode
[3:06:08] <+MrATheGreat> Use overload
[3:06:10] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Gory
[3:06:13] <Sunstalker> because you can start thise game on a maxed character and learn extra skills after? So you can cover all your options a lot better then previous games.
[3:06:14] <peachy996> You may have to use your guns more than you powers Biotic Man
[3:06:15] <%jillyrancher> stop nova punching turrets
[3:06:18] <Coystick> Damage filter is intense
[3:06:18] <+condemned_15> NADE
[3:06:28] <+akscully> warp on armor
[3:06:29] <+Scevda> Hardcore is the new norm
[3:06:30] <mar_krow> Pat is warframeing it
[3:06:32] <%Deebo305> Imagine the enemy not being braindead
[3:06:33] <ExpressNode> Ded
[3:06:33] <%LeiaSkynoober> You should respect the turrets more
[3:06:35] <+Krecart> This mission is a rough one.
[3:06:35] <%QueequegTheater> Nova is not safe on block
[3:06:36] <Latija> easy mode is now selectable
[3:06:39] <+Scevda> Its just that you are below avg pat.
[3:06:39] <+D00msDayDan> better keep charging in
[3:06:40] <$realm_forge> HypeKO
[3:06:40] <FlyguyJP> SO turrets to NOT stop firing when charged
[3:06:41] <@commanderclaw> You do know that you use up your shields with that move, right?
[3:06:41] <+Chaos_Aether> Turrets 4 Pat 0
[3:06:41] <%Varlinator> Yes, it is Pat
[3:06:43] <%EthorXL> HARDCORE!
[3:06:43] <Aiutare47> Using a power that converts your shields to damage against high damage enemies with decent health pools is unwise.
[3:06:44] <%intestinal_bleeding> it's the stinky turrets
[3:06:44] <%VioletHeart> You know Nova drains all your shields, right...?
[3:06:45] <%dooscent> The Brutality of Normal
[3:06:45] <+MrATheGreat> Yeah charge is risky on any mode but casual LUL
[3:06:47] <+cermo55> stop blowing your shields
[3:06:48] <heartlesshealer> Pat, eating his shields: Why am I dying?
[3:06:49] <%jillyrancher> Use warp for armor Pat
[3:06:50] <%Monkeyweed21> stop novaing when youre in danger
[3:06:50] <%coward_man> hardcore is super not the new normal chat is insane
[3:06:54] <%gliph13> you're really going to have to forget about charge with turrets involved.
[3:06:55] <%SaiyanShoto> it is if you're good
[3:06:55] <$Futurecity10> I hate to say it, but you just dont understanyour class right now
[3:06:56] <karl_rex> Stop using NOVA
[3:06:57] <4DLuvOfLuthy> you just have to respect the turrets lol, gotta use cover here
[3:06:58] <mar_krow> Turrets win
[3:06:59] <ExpressNode> Can't you change the difficulty or is it too late?
[3:06:59] <anAngryHamster> Pat.._
[3:07:00] <DSD24> Pat its just the turrets killing focusing you down
[3:07:02] <+DracosMagala> Here is your Chicken Hat LUL
[3:07:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Against turrets, use Garrus' overload against their shields, then use Liara's warp on the armor, then charge. IIRC it causes a biotic detonation that just nukes turrets
[3:07:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hardcore was also the new normal in ME2
[3:07:04] <DatAsuna> If you played ME3 MP, normal is equivalent to bronze mode/easy mode.
[3:07:06] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah cuz you were on normal
[3:07:07] <Halospaz117> I think he might not actually know that nova uses his sheilds
[3:07:09] <xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Confirm you know about Nova and the shields.
[3:07:11] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can cast warp on the turrets and then charge for a biotic explosion.
[3:07:11] <%dave323dave> pat...
[3:07:13] <%intestinal_bleeding> hmmm
[3:07:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Turrents are the problem.
[3:07:13] <%Varlinator> Oh so now because you have to use your brain a bit it's hard? LUL
[3:07:13] <Deasmeister> Engineers keep placing turrets
[3:07:14] <peachy996> well time to wake up bitch
[3:07:14] <FlyguyJP> Those turrets man. They shred anyone out of cover
[3:07:14] <$Futurecity10> You keep firing, use nova
[3:07:14] <Blank9> nova burns the shield your charge just gave you
[3:07:14] <HarshNerf> biotic powers on turrets?
[3:07:15] <Verriand> what was that
[3:07:15] <tattleworm> literally standing there as a turret tears you to pieces
[3:07:16] <+Scevda> ya? Ya wonder why?

[3:07:41] <TheMostAverageGamer4> true
[3:07:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> Use Warp then shockwave, it'll nuke turrets
[3:07:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you were also using DLC guns
[3:07:43] <+akscully> lol
[3:07:43] <spongeofmystery> Imbecile
[3:07:43] <heartlesshealer> NO TACKLES
[3:07:43] <+Scevda> GIT GUD
[3:07:43] <mar_krow> Pat turret just let ur team handle it
[3:07:43] <Verriand> Pat, just know we love you very much
[3:07:43] <%QueequegTheater> THAT'S WHY MASS EFFECT 2 WAS EASY, BECAUSE YOU WERE ON BABY MODE
[3:07:44] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[3:07:45] <+MrATheGreat> Stop. charging
[3:07:45] <%The_Protagonist> bonked
[3:07:47] <Sunstalker> Hardcore here is just easier then it was in 2, is all.
[3:07:47] <Coystick> Normal is pretty easy
[3:07:47] <%jillyrancher> ME2 Normal is baby mode
[3:07:48] <peachy996> you'd still get shredded by turrets on normal
[3:07:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Nova uses your shields.
[3:07:49] <+zuzuxiv> MAO
[3:07:49] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Stop using Melee, you're not invinible
[3:07:50] <$realm_forge> IT WOULD BE NORMAL IF YOU USED COVER
[3:07:51] <$KnightAsteran> literally just killing yourself now
[3:07:52] <KeystoneA2> You don't have to go this way yet. You will later, but not now.
[3:07:53] <g0d_zill4> Nova seems not good to me
[3:07:54] <mar_krow> Normal is easy
[3:07:54] <Aiutare47> Pat just use cover in the cover shooter you can’t stagger metal.
[3:07:54] <+D00msDayDan> maybe if he keeps letting turrets shoot him it'll work out
[3:07:55] <DSD24> Pat the Turrets are the problem
[3:07:55] <%Movemeister> LUL
[3:07:55] <+Chaos_Aether> Turret 6 pat 0
[3:07:59] <%QueequegTheater> Normal
[3:07:59] <+AmericanSkidd> I think chat is fucking with you
[3:08:00] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:08:00] <+zuzuxiv> Man this is -bad-
[3:08:03] <@commanderclaw> Use Garrus' overload on the turrets, stop using Nova when enemies have line of sight on you, use cover
[3:08:03] <+alphonseisbest> so pat was on easy?
[3:08:05] <karl_rex> Cover exists
[3:08:06] <%jillyrancher> pat vs turret
[3:08:06] <peachy996> Use Weapons+Cover in this encounter not biotics
[3:08:08] <%QueequegTheater> What
[3:08:08] <4DLuvOfLuthy> The engineers are enjoying your pain pat lol
[3:08:09] <Yrefe> he just keeps throwing that raw super LUL
[3:08:09] <%Deebo305> Do you the definition of insanity
[3:08:11] <FassieFons> I'm sure charging at 3 turrets will work THIS TIME
[3:08:12] <+Scevda> THE REAPER WAR IS HERE PAT. GET YOUR  BALLS ON THE TABLE
[3:08:13] <Halospaz117> STOP NOVAING IN DANGER
[3:08:14] <ItsAllJohnny> Just switch it to normal. These people obviously played a shit tonne of multiplayer
[3:08:15] <mar_krow> I kinda am
[3:08:17] <%jillyrancher> kinda yeah
[3:08:17] <FlyguyJP> Play more cautious until engineers and turrets dead. Resist charging until those are done.
[3:08:21] <%SaiyanShoto> no this would be normal because normal is baby mode
[3:08:21] <peachy996> Babymode is not normal it's babymode Paige
[3:08:24] <peachy996> I mean Pat
[3:08:24] <Profmcstevie> Stop throwing out Nova willy nilly, it's depleting shields
[3:08:24] <xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt You do realize that nova uses your shields?
[3:08:25] <studleydoorite> what mode was my early 20s on?
[3:08:26] <peachy996> Oops
[3:08:29] <dawarw0lf> I knew the turrets would fuck him up
[3:08:29] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just stop spamming Nova, it's not safe on block
[3:08:30] <%Deano8817> I feel like chat and pat are arguing about 2 completely different things
[3:08:31] <%coward_man> Chat's insane and trying to act like they're top tier MLG
[3:08:31] <heartlesshealer> Pat trying to play like Paige
[3:08:34] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Your bullets come out of your crosshairs instead of your gun, just put your model behind a wall and cheese it
[3:08:37] <tattleworm> just be selective about your targets
[3:08:37] <PaperyHornet1013> You want to set it to narrative?
[3:08:39] <+cermo55> Garuss-OVERLOAD ON TURRENT
[3:08:40] <+alphonseisbest> I for one say to switch it over to Normal!
[3:08:41] <%Solid_Stro> louiseySmug
[3:08:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda yes but moderates don't matter if they are scared to speak. They are going at it in such a dogmatic way because they want to scare people into silence. if you make it so nobody believes they have no backing on their opinions they won't back them themselves
[3:08:45] <godila2> pat doesnt have DLC weapons so he is kinda underpowerd here
[3:08:46] <DapperCadavr> Pat you're doing great, the turrets are just butts
[3:08:46] <+RoByte2> Has Pat intentionally done a biotic combo yet?
[3:08:47] <+beansoup> LUL
[3:08:50] <+MrATheGreat> The difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 is Mass Effect 3 is hard leaning into being a tactical shooter as opposed to an RPG
[3:08:51] <+Gamblor69> Turrets are fucking aimbots
[3:08:55] <FlyguyJP> Garrus already dead
[3:08:56] <%QueequegTheater> @RoByte2 no
[3:08:56] <%jillyrancher> TBF this is a tough mission so early on hardcore
[3:08:59] <Sunstalker> Exploit weaknesses on enemies peepoSad
[3:09:03] <stormhawk9891> @RoByte2 No
[3:09:03] <tattleworm> turning off your shields to give them a sporting chance, very honourable
[3:09:03] <%intestinal_bleeding> you got t his
[3:09:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> That sound is making me want to die
[3:09:11] <+fetrigon> ah sick they're flanking
[3:09:11] <dawarw0lf> Even if this was normal the turrets would still fuck your up. Your one difficulty above normal right now
[3:09:12] <%jillyrancher> Pat use medigel
[3:09:12] <+Scevda> @deano8817 we are, pat likes to divert and   Confuse
[3:09:13] <FlyguyJP> Turrets are aimbot and a single burst can shred shields and kill you.
[3:09:18] <%Varlinator> Has Pat ever used his squadmates abilities... Like... Ever??
[3:09:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt To be fair pat youa re here early
[3:09:24] <Mattais88> This i going to be real fun when the end of mission wave hits
[3:09:26] <valriot> YEEE WARP CHARGE BEST COMBO
[3:09:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Varlinator Yes.
[3:09:29] <dawarw0lf> Combos destroy turrets too
[3:09:30] <heartlesshealer> better
[3:09:32] <DracaenaLeaf> nice pose
[3:09:33] <+MrATheGreat> there ya go
[3:09:33] <+akscully> first try
[3:09:33] <4DLuvOfLuthy> First Try!
[3:09:34] <AngryAsian5> First try!
[3:09:35] <+alphonseisbest> @Varlinator yes
[3:09:36] <+AmericanSkidd> you did it
[3:09:36] <+beansoup> he's learning :) so proud
[3:09:39] <Coystick> Cakewalk
[3:09:40] <peachy996> Priotize the Engineers they can buff the turrets
[3:09:40] <dawarw0lf> Kinda
[3:09:42] <%Deano8817> difficulty wise
[3:09:43] <%The_Protagonist> @Varlinator are you watching? he's literally manually had them use them like 10 times in this area lol
[3:09:44] <Profmcstevie> Maybe not having Nova in 2 did more to your playstyle than you realise
[3:09:44] <%coward_man> you're not here early
[3:09:44] <HarshNerf> no deaths
[3:09:44] <%jillyrancher> You can do it
[3:09:44] <peachy996> Yeah
[3:09:48] <KeystoneA2> Yeah you could've gone another way though.
[3:09:48] <xcompleasedad> @Varlinator He just did..... after years of not.
[3:09:50] <Profmcstevie> DLC
[3:09:50] <%jillyrancher> First try
[3:09:52] <%ahomeschooldropout> Game wants you to do it later but Javik is sweet so fuck that
[3:09:52] <+DracosMagala> Turrets are the new Locust SMGs
[3:09:54] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt You can get isntakills with melee from cover on enemies often btw.
[3:09:57] <$realm_forge> You punched  all the turrets
[3:09:57] <+rageoftheporo> why do u think they keep killing u lol
[3:09:57] <%QueequegTheater> In full armor
[3:10:00] <+MrATheGreat> This is mid-game leveled enemies
[3:10:01] <%hatok> DLC is available really fast even though it shouldn't be
[3:10:02] <Wolfstriker121> what game was they watching tho!?!
[3:10:02] <DatAsuna> Not using the combo system is like playing MGR and never parrying
[3:10:03] <%intestinal_bleeding> what game would that be?
[3:10:03] <%Varlinator> If you say so
[3:10:03] <HarshNerf> the gamw
[3:10:05] <dawarw0lf> Engineers are introduced next story mission
[3:10:06] <godila2> yeah, because next main mission would introduce all these enemies pat
[3:10:10] <%intestinal_bleeding> space ball?
[3:10:10] <tattleworm> there's a bunch of cutscenes for these new enemies in the main story that're supposed to be your introduction to them
[3:10:13] <Deasmeister> Later game enemys
[3:10:13] <Lancaster_H> also nova drains your shields, you know that right? @PatStaresAt
[3:10:14] <+Scevda> @doc_ock_rokc once again you are misinterpreting my stance here. Im done with this convo. Im not your opposition.
[3:10:15] <+Goraka91> The game, hockey right?
[3:10:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Its DLC its avalable when you buy it andyou bought it with the game
[3:10:16] <FlyguyJP> And if you destroy a turret any engineers can just slam down a new one. Engineers are first priority
[3:10:20] <Wolfstriker121> was they wacthing blizball?
[3:10:21] <%TheYellowcouch> They were just having cold ones with the boys
[3:10:31] <%gliph13> all for humanity, right elusive man?!
[3:10:35] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:10:35] <KeystoneA2> lol
[3:10:37] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[3:10:37] <%Varlinator> Good plan LUL
[3:10:37] <tattleworm> yeah, stop doing that
[3:10:38] <valriot> Turrets fuck dude LUL
[3:10:40] <Latija> Scum
[3:10:41] <%QueequegTheater> WELCOME TO DIE
[3:10:41] <DSD24> The Turrets are hard counters Pat
[3:10:41] <GustauveVIII> WARP THE TURRET PAT
[3:10:42] <%coward_man> okay... THAT one was on you
[3:10:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> MORTIS
[3:10:44] <heartlesshealer> ...............
[3:10:44] <Aiutare47> Don’t charge the gun emplacements please
[3:10:47] <MarylandJutsu> are ya winning son?
[3:10:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scevda Im not treating you as opposition im just stating my opinion
[3:10:47] <4DLuvOfLuthy> turrety boi wins again
[3:10:49] <%TheYellowcouch> Get the piss out my dude
[3:10:49] <+D00msDayDan> should take some cover too
[3:10:49] <%QueequegTheater> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:10:51] <djblue_shift> will he learn to respect the turrets
[3:10:51] <+fetrigon> nice
[3:10:51] <OldManDeckardCain> PISS THE SALT AWAY
[3:10:51] <xcompleasedad> STOP BUNGA-ING
[3:10:53] <Aiutare47> He charged the gun emplacements
[3:10:55] <+PenmanLupine> you weren't taking the piss already?
[3:10:55] <djblue_shift> find out next time
[3:10:55] <%jillyrancher> This mission is lousy with Engineera tbf
[3:10:56] <heartlesshealer> no learning
[3:10:57] <%Monkeyweed21> BABY MODE TIME
[3:10:58] <Latija> You won't forget this devil's power
[3:10:59] <+Goraka91> Turret go BRRRRRRR
[3:11:02] <dawarw0lf> Even if he changes differently they will still be a problem
[3:11:03] <$realm_forge> COMMANDER SHEPARD: SLAYER OF QUSSY AND PUNCHER OF TURRETS
[3:11:03] <%Varlinator> Rage piss
[3:11:04] <+Scevda> Good idea!
[3:11:04] <FlyguyJP> Remember kids. DO NOT charge turrets. Turrets have no stun frames.
[3:11:05] <kjb343> engineer turrets fucking suck
[3:11:07] <xcompleasedad> Gonna be some chunky salt piss
[3:11:10] <heartlesshealer> Pat loves to play SOL
[3:11:10] <karl_rex> Can't unga bunga turrets
[3:11:11] <+DracosMagala> He's gonna cry in his car LUL
[3:11:11] <%Monkeyweed21> TIME TO DO EASY MODE
[3:11:15] <GuyverTypeL> Those turrets do fuck tho
[3:11:15] <dawarw0lf> There the worst enemies in the game
[3:11:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Engie is basically angie Vangaurd anyway
[3:11:17] <samcast1> the risk was calculated
[3:11:19] <Sunstalker> Pat will not learn to overload shields or use armor piercing effects on turrets peepoSad
[3:11:20] <PaperyHornet1013> Rage quit
[3:11:21] <%jillyrancher> Big turret dominates tiny gamer
[3:11:21] <macavells> EASY MODE AVAILABLE
[3:11:22] <peachy996> Turret is winning the first to 10 so far
[3:11:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fuck I love the design of Crazy Talk, it's so strong
[3:11:24] <+Scevda> Breaks are good to come back and go about it differently.
[3:11:25] <OldManDeckardCain> OH NO I ACCIDENTALLY LOWERED THE DIFFICULTY
[3:11:27] <+AmericanSkidd> hardcore is the new normal, normal is actually easy= hardcore is easy baby mode
[3:11:32] <blackjack8182> Easy mode is selectable
[3:11:36] <%Solid_Stro> And magically the settings will switch to easy mode coxEric
[3:11:37] <Aiutare47> Turrets don’t stagger, which is one of the strongest things about Charge
[3:11:37] <CurrySauseBandit> @jillyrancher It's bad, but this is a masterclass of using no mechanics and just facefucking the game into death.
[3:11:40] <+Scevda> @flyguyjp truth
[3:11:45] <HarshNerf> armor? isn't that just yellow health? Kappa
[3:11:47] <peachy996> Pat's a Vanguard with no Sniper Rifle so he picked the worst way to go about this
[3:11:50] <%QueequegTheater> Pat has been stumped by an enemy that requires a single non-unga bunga
[3:11:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Easy mode is being selected
[3:11:53] <%Varlinator> He's turning the difficulty back down to Baby Casual as we speak
[3:11:53] <peachy996> in his defense
[3:12:05] <%jillyrancher> For real though ME2 normal is baby mode enemies dont even have defenses
[3:12:07] <xcompleasedad> @HarshNerf God, he MIGHT actually think that
[3:12:10] <%Varlinator> @QueequegTheater LUL
[3:12:12] <PaperyHornet1013> He made us sit through scanning for this
[3:12:13] <@commanderclaw> Pat cannot comprehend maybe the need to have more than just two abilities and 1 weapon
[3:12:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is Vanguard without a shotgun Turrets are Anti vanguard
[3:12:20] <Lancaster_H> why isnt he using a shotgun btw?
[3:12:24] <dawarw0lf> GET RIDS OF SHIELDS TO NOVA. Dies to no Shields. “The game is too hard”
[3:12:26] <DSD24> Vanguard needs Overlord from his buddies
[3:12:29] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater as a Vangard I disagree, HE's not unga bunga'ing ENOUGHT
[3:12:29] <%jillyrancher> cause Pat
[3:12:32] <djblue_shift> so i may have cheated a little and gotten creds to give garrus the typhoon and fuck
[3:12:41] <%QueequegTheater> @Lancaster_H minmaxing the recharge speed
[3:12:43] <Lancaster_H> @jillyrancher fair
[3:12:46] <+zuzuxiv> i'm back what happened
[3:12:50] <Sunstalker> This is all caused because pat never tried to do ME2 insanity with vanguard and learn to do more then Charge > Shoot
[3:12:50] <+zuzuxiv> did he kill the turrets
[3:12:53] <+Scevda> @commanderclaw not to even mention using the skill to pause and reacquire targets.
[3:12:57] <%jillyrancher> No
[3:12:58] <xcompleasedad> @alphonseisbest He's bungaing before his ungas!
[3:13:03] <DatAsuna> @doc_ock_rokc they're also pretty fragile, the main issue is he's changing nothing to deal with shields or armour despite having squadmates who could do that for him
[3:13:03] <+Scevda> Skill wheel*
[3:13:06] <Lancaster_H> @QueequegTheater im pretty sure he can get the same with one shotgun tho
[3:13:18] <dawarw0lf> He can just get the venom shotgun to delete turrets so they won’t be a problem
[3:13:21] <%jillyrancher> Pat never used pull at all in 2 and hes still barely using pull
[3:13:32] <DSD24> Geth Shotgun is great in this game
[3:13:36] <Jaysky> @doc_ock_rokc He's used to unga bunga in ME2
[3:13:42] <GuyverTypeL> RE-LOAD SingsMic GlitchCat
[3:13:46] <%jillyrancher> "Pull is objectively the worst"
[3:13:48] <DatAsuna> I can definitely see Woolie running into similar probalems trying to unga vanguard
[3:13:49] <%QueequegTheater> @Lancaster_H You forget that Pat is bad at understanding
[3:13:49] <dawarw0lf> @jillyrancher It’s not even specked in
[3:13:50] <PaperyHornet1013> He 100% changed the difficulty
[3:13:50] <xcompleasedad> @Scevda I think he's the "pausing during an RTS is lame" kinda guy, despite not playing RTS's
[3:13:55] <%jillyrancher> psaBougie
[3:13:55] <%QueequegTheater> *understadning RPGs
[3:13:59] <%QueequegTheater> SHOW DIFFICULTY
[3:14:00] <DatAsuna> You have to use the squad commands when you're a vanguard or adept
[3:14:01] <+alphonseisbest> why did he put it on HARDCORE?
[3:14:04] <DatAsuna> Your squad commands will help a lot for busting shields. Shields are a vanguard's biggest enemy.
[3:14:06] <Lancaster_H> @QueequegTheater also fair
[3:14:07] <+Scevda> @datasuna ya hes pretty inflexible at times when it comes to playstyle it doesnt help that the games series have not challenged him to fo before now
[3:14:08] <%QueequegTheater> SHOW DIFFICULTY SETTINGS, COWARD
[3:14:10] <heartlesshealer> welcome back
[3:14:14] <+AmericanSkidd> also not the problem here
[3:14:17] <@commanderclaw> Queequeg, chill
[3:14:19] <+Krecart> Who cares about Pull when you have Charge and Nova
[3:14:22] <xcompleasedad> SHOW DIFFICULTY
[3:14:22] <+Scevda> @xcompleasedad true
[3:14:26] <heartlesshealer> pat's been doing things, just the wrong things for fighting turrets
[3:14:27] <+AmericanSkidd> turn it back
[3:14:30] <%QueequegTheater> It super is
[3:14:30] <Yrefe> in 3 pull is broken
[3:14:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> Fair enough.
[3:14:30] <Badgerconda_> Why do you listen to chat, Pat?
[3:14:31] <%jillyrancher> use it more Pat its good
[3:14:31] <DatAsuna> Pull is a specific counter to shields
[3:14:32] <$realm_forge> Pat only uses pull when Paige is out of town
[3:14:34] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Warp the turrets before you biotic charge it for max damage.
[3:14:37] <SummonerMagno> just git gud
[3:14:38] <+Midashu> chat is killing Pat's enjoyment of ME3
[3:14:38] <Lancaster_H> it is
[3:14:39] <%coward_man> "intended for players looking for a challenge"
[3:14:39] <DSD24> Pat Turrets are just hard counters
[3:14:39] <+unhuggable1> hardcore is not normal
[3:14:40] <heartlesshealer> Stop using shield-eating powers on machines
[3:14:40] <+MrATheGreat> Pull doesn't work in ME 2 if enemies have armor or shields
[3:14:42] <%Solid_Stro> You’re pulling our emotions right now
[3:14:42] <+alphonseisbest> ITS SUPER NOT
[3:14:47] <FlyguyJP> Pat please, never charge a turret. They have no stun frames and just keep shooting you.
[3:14:51] <%jillyrancher> Pull is perfect for combos yo
[3:14:51] <DatAsuna> Use squad commands to overload shields before you charge in
[3:14:53] <peachy996> Ah you've chosen easy mode huh
[3:14:54] <Aiutare47> It is. You’re just not using cover
[3:14:54] <heartlesshealer> machines never stagger
[3:14:54] <%MidnightBurst12> chat is full of crazy people
[3:14:55] <Sunstalker> Vanguard was too strong for your playthrough in ME2 and you never learned to play around it's weaknesses so now it's curbstomping you D:
[3:14:56] <+alphonseisbest> HARDCARE IS NOT NORMAL WTF
[3:14:59] <Jaysky> Whatever is one difficulty above regular is what I'd go with
[3:14:59] <tattleworm> you'll be able to facetank everything when you get reave, no worries
[3:15:00] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt Is it just the DLC giving you difficulty so far? The Difficulty could be harder scaled
[3:15:00] <%CalderGaming> PJSalt
[3:15:01] <%coward_man> Pat fuck chat and just go to normal and have fun
[3:15:02] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Stop facetanking turrets then
[3:15:03] <+alphonseisbest> hardcore
[3:15:03] <karl_rex> Play the cover shooter like a cover shooter?
[3:15:06] <blackjack8182> Hardcore is normal if you imported from 2
[3:15:09] <+RoByte2> “Mankind knew they cannot change society. So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the Beasts.”
[3:15:09] <peachy996> Hardcore is normal
[3:15:14] <Jaysky> Is it actually? Shit
[3:15:14] <PanicSwytch> DON'T LISTEN TO CHAT...ITS A BUNCH OF ONE GUYS TODAY
[3:15:17] <SummonerMagno> just lower difficulty by one
[3:15:19] <Lancaster_H> charging into a turret that cannot be stunlocked has literally 0 to do with difficulty
[3:15:19] <+AmericanSkidd> ignore us we will only bring pain
[3:15:20] <dawarw0lf> I can’t believe this
[3:15:20] <DatAsuna> Use liara for CC/armour shredding and Garrus to pop shield or armour
[3:15:24] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Only this mission is harder if you do it this early
[3:15:24] <%Garthunox> "Im getting hard countered, why amnt i winning!"
[3:15:26] <Yrefe> are you comboing with liara's psionic?
[3:15:26] <+unhuggable1> @karl_rex not as vanguard
[3:15:31] <Jaysky> It's been a while since I played ME3
[3:15:32] <DSD24> Don't worry Pat you got this!
[3:15:32] <+alphonseisbest> Hardcore is not normal
[3:15:34] <Profmcstevie> If this is too easy we'll shift it up then
[3:15:34] <%SvenHolgersson> If hardcore was normal it would be called normal
[3:15:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat considers not literally being immortal to be really hard guys
[3:15:36] <DapperCadavr> Even on normal this game will kick your ass
[3:15:37] <dekkitout> Does this game do higher difficulty of 'enemies are smarter and have more function otherwise' or just 'enemies have bigger number'?
[3:15:37] <KnightOfTrousers> Play what feels fun, Pat
[3:15:38] <+D00msDayDan> why the fuck are you listening to people saying hardcore is normal
[3:15:40] <%Chichen> pat lower it to easy out of spite
[3:15:40] <%dave323dave> pat that is not what they mean
[3:15:41] <%coward_man> dude switch to normal chat is insane
[3:15:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Pat collectively gaslighting pat
[3:15:43] <%QueequegTheater> Hardcore is new normal for BOTH 2 and 3
[3:15:44] <+RAWPowerStudios> Hardcore is corehard
[3:15:46] <%cade_calrayn> Seriously fuck chat, play what you want, Pat
[3:15:47] <%somekindofsam> one guy
[3:15:49] <FlyguyJP> Does Pat want a cakewalk?
[3:15:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Also rats can't swim
[3:15:50] <notsoy> didn't these clowns just say turrets hard-counter the vanguard bumrush?
[3:15:51] <mar_krow> Switch it back pay if u don’t like it
[3:15:53] <%captain_kirkhammer> Guys this is just another rats casn't swim thing
[3:15:53] <%RLT917> Never trust Chat atpCarl
[3:15:53] <KnightOfTrousers> Y'all are difficulty elitests, just play what's fun, Pat
[3:15:53] <peachy996> Just turn it to Storymode Paige
[3:15:53] <heartlesshealer> it WOULD BE, but you IGNORE UI
[3:15:54] <+Scevda> Pat, a traditional play-through of ME3 assumes for starting at LEVEL 1. You came in on level 30.
[3:15:54] <@commanderclaw> It's mostly Queequeg saying it
[3:15:54] <tattleworm> there's a huge gulf between me3 normal and me3 hardcore, hardcore is closer to most games' normal mode
[3:15:55] <PaperyHornet1013> We believe in you pat
[3:15:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You were supposed to do Hardcore in 2
[3:15:55] <Sunstalker> Just don't Charge at an unstunnable enemy with shields and armor still up NotLikeThis
[3:15:55] <+Mrbaconator> there is no war in ba sing sey
[3:15:58] <%coward_man> cause they need to feel like they're big
[3:15:59] <peachy996> I mean Pat
[3:16:01] <tanarath> Pat, switch back
[3:16:01] <+alphonseisbest> hardcore is NOT normal
[3:16:01] <dawarw0lf> The main reason we’re saying this pat is because insanity is like hardcore in /m2
[3:16:01] <+unhuggable1> play the difficulty you feel comfortable with
[3:16:03] <+Midashu> chat is ruining this
[3:16:03] <blackjack8182> Hardcore is normal
[3:16:07] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Chat collectively gaslighting Pat
[3:16:08] <TheAntiNihilist> cakewalk
[3:16:09] <%jillyrancher> I wouldnt say it's new normal
[3:16:10] <%QueequegTheater> According to it being way too easy
[3:16:10] <supergoblinpunch> It is normal
[3:16:14] <mar_krow> Do what u want
[3:16:14] <%cvp5127> ?
[3:16:15] <+Goraka91> Insanity is Normal clearly
[3:16:15] <heartlesshealer> Feel free to change it, but please look at your UI
[3:16:16] <%Garthunox> the copium is real
[3:16:19] <DatAsuna> The problem is you're playing scissors against rock and not changing your tactic
[3:16:19] <%Garthunox> "Im getting hard countered, why amnt i winning!"
[3:16:19] <dawarw0lf> So hardcore feels like normal in me 2
[3:16:20] <%Mr_Pylon> wtf do people care so much about this?!
[3:16:23] <%saadi90> Who cares about gameplay in Mass Effect games anyway. Play it on normal or easy.
[3:16:27] <FlyguyJP> Oh god, this is the Hill chat and Pat will die on.
[3:16:28] <Zombrocom> I guess what they are saying is the normal in ME2 was a cakewalk, so hardcore is the "normal" difficulty?
[3:16:28] <spongeofmystery> Chat has always been at war with Eastasia
[3:16:28] <%Larry_Q> difficulty is the most subjective thing ever
[3:16:29] <+AmericanSkidd> MY DAD WORKS AT NINTENDO
[3:16:32] <peachy996> Do Story Difficult
[3:16:34] <PaperyHornet1013> Gaslight him chat
[3:16:35] <%gliph13> I'm getting the distinct feeling that Chat is full of s*** right now.
[3:16:35] <+DracosMagala> LUL
[3:16:35] <+D00msDayDan> advanced gameplay skills AKA charging straight into the thing you shouldn't charge straight into
[3:16:36] <+alphonseisbest> Keep it at normal PLS
[3:16:37] <%Ranryu692> play normal. you'll still die sometimes
[3:16:38] <%Taisuru> Shhhhh
[3:16:40] <OldManDeckardCain> WHAT, mass effect 3 is not an rpg LUL
[3:16:41] <+JaseAdrift> ITS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT READING IT
[3:16:41] <blackjack8182> If you imported you should play on Hardcore
[3:16:42] <%Dopamien> NotLikeThis people are this dumb
[3:16:42] <Sunstalker> @Scevda DansGame No it's not, majority of people play it on a ME2 savefile
[3:16:43] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Sip
[3:16:43] <DSD24> Insanity is fun in ME3
[3:16:43] <%coward_man> "This is the baseline ME experience" The game LITERALLY says it's intended to play on normal
[3:16:45] <Latija> you're doing great pat, do what feels right
[3:16:46] <%Taisuru> Normal is good
[3:16:47] <peachy996> Do Story Difficulty
[3:16:47] <Wolfstriker121> CHAT BEHAVE!
[3:16:48] <%Wallabri> Play it on normal and have a nice time
[3:16:51] <%Chichen> just play on easy
[3:16:51] <DapperCadavr> I will say, even on normal the Turrets are BRUTAL
[3:16:53] <DatAsuna> Use the hard counters to each health type and you'll be fine.
[3:16:54] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Get rect CHAT
[3:16:55] <DSD24> Hackerman
[3:17:00] <%Taisuru> IT FUCKING SAYS NORMAL
[3:17:03] <%SvenHolgersson> RATS CAN'T SWIM
[3:17:05] <HarshNerf> who cares about gameplay in ME, just rush through it for the dating sim
[3:17:06] <TheAntiNihilist> cakewalk
[3:17:06] <+unhuggable1> chat shut
[3:17:07] <heartlesshealer> I'm fine with pat playing -any- mode. Just let the shield UI enter Pat's vision, please game
[3:17:07] <mar_krow> But u kinda did run it down pat to turrets
[3:17:08] <%LeiaSkynoober> Chat is trying to gaslight Pat and it's so annoying oh my gosh
[3:17:08] <FlyguyJP> Movie Time
[3:17:10] <GuyverTypeL> Just do what is most comfortable to you Pat
[3:17:11] <%TheYellowcouch> Gatekeep, Gaslight Chatboss
[3:17:12] <%miguelrod777> damn they getting fucked
[3:17:16] <Zombrocom> Who cares
[3:17:17] <%saiko2208> Pat stop listening to chat… we are stupid
[3:17:17] <dawarw0lf> It’s not that it says that it FEELS like it
[3:17:20] <Profmcstevie> Protheans build rectangles, neat
[3:17:23] <%ahomeschooldropout> Really it's only this level is stupid hard, but that's cause they expected you to do it later. Everything else is stupid easy
[3:17:23] <DatAsuna> Against turrets, just stay in cover, have the squad break their shields so that when you do charge, you oneshot, no followup
[3:17:24] <tattleworm> it's the boy
[3:17:25] <%jillyrancher> like it doesn't help this is a bit of a tough mission
[3:17:26] <%Mr_Pylon> wait wouldn't the Reaper ships be different back then?
[3:17:27] <T_Sasquatch> personally bepis is the best combat difficulty
[3:17:29] <+alphonseisbest> @heartlesshealer this PLS
[3:17:34] <%jillyrancher> cause lots of turrets
[3:17:36] <dawarw0lf> Insanity feels easier then me2
[3:17:39] <+Scevda> @heartlesshealer true
[3:17:41] <Wolfstriker121> next thing chat will say pigs 100% fly and are the next form of birds....
[3:17:43] <%QueequegTheater> I will stop, but just know I'm not trying to gaslight anyone
[3:17:43] <Profmcstevie> What is that accent
[3:17:46] <+vaderxyz1970> Chat is making the stream less fun
[3:17:47] <mr_saturday93> God javiks VA is sooooo fucking good
[3:17:53] <+theCatastrophy> just found out that Javik has the same voice actor as Seer from Apex Legends
[3:17:53] <%jillyrancher> Look at how much the Reapers fucked up the Protheans
[3:17:56] <Aiutare47> Protheans actually live in Mexico.
[3:17:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @Profmcstevie south african
[3:18:01] <mar_krow> JAvik
[3:18:02] <Zombrocom> "Victory"
[3:18:03] <+AmericanSkidd> You didnt have to listen to us
[3:18:04] <williamrooster> umpire
[3:18:07] <+akscully> prothean husks
[3:18:08] <%dooscent> Collectors are just Prothean husks, yeah
[3:18:09] <%jillyrancher> collectors have no mouths, no pupils, wings, etc
[3:18:09] <%TheYellowcouch> or maybe this is late
[3:18:12] <tattleworm> prothean held on a long time
[3:18:14] <KeystoneA2> Well Collectors are Protheans, so
[3:18:14] <$EsotericOdyssey> aren't collectors basicall- yeah, prothean husks
[3:18:15] <Zombrocom> Basically husks
[3:18:17] <+RAWPowerStudios> You were supposed to play hardcore in ME2 because of the "Shoulds" and "Control Fallacies" as outlined in "Cognitive Distortions"
[3:18:17] <%coward_man> damn I was typing exactly that Pat
[3:18:18] <%captain_kirkhammer> how rude
[3:18:21] <+Scevda> @mr_pylon nah, they are an accumulative enemy
[3:18:23] <+RoByte2> That was hundreds of years into the war
[3:18:28] <%TheYellowcouch> Reaper us fed
[3:18:34] <djblue_shift> why don't collectors don't look nearly as fucked up as reaper variants
[3:18:35] <FlyguyJP> Oh god just give it up Chat.
[3:18:35] <Mattais88> Didn't Liara grab that from your mind in 1?
[3:18:35] <Aiutare47> Husks or cannibals or marauders yeah
[3:18:37] <+D00msDayDan> they never came up with a way for shepard to share the cipher huh
[3:18:42] <+unhuggable1> mask on
[3:18:43] <heartlesshealer> to be fair, I do hate how shields, a very important health aspect, is just a thin curved line
[3:18:49] <+akscully> overload for garrus!
[3:18:54] <+Midashu> chat is obviously indoctrinated
[3:18:55] <%QueequegTheater> Radius IMO
[3:18:56] <Profmcstevie> Wonder what husks they used to conquer them
[3:18:57] <%gliph13> there is something about javic having a THIC African accent that i really really LOVE!
[3:18:58] <mar_krow> Shappard eyes were glowing did that happen before
[3:19:03] <peachy996> Think about how you easily mogged that Brute near
[3:19:05] <+RowenCleric> Liaras little mask seems so unsafe
[3:19:06] <peachy996> Palaven
[3:19:11] <Sunstalker> How did cerberus put that cipher back into your brain after lab growing you?
[3:19:12] <tattleworm> either's fine here
[3:19:15] <%crazyspartan214> radius
[3:19:18] <%jillyrancher> Pat why arent you putting anything into inciedary or cryo ammo
[3:19:21] <HarshNerf> @heartlesshealer nah level of shield is meaningless you only care about shield break anyways so why maximise the UI for it
[3:19:23] <peachy996> The DLC episode is a little fucky in terms of difficulty
[3:19:25] <Verriand> @mar_krow I think they did that in 1 when he slaps the first beacon
[3:19:26] <GustauveVIII> 6 seconds is long enough
[3:19:26] <@StridentSong> Wait didn't Liara mind meld with you when you got the completed beacon in ME1? Wouldn't she be able to understand the Prothean language?
[3:19:28] <%QueequegTheater> Radius lets you pick up more enemies
[3:19:29] <DatAsuna> RAdius would matter more if he was using combos
[3:19:30] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The war took centuries to end. So it makes sense there would be collectors.
[3:19:43] <DatAsuna> If he doesn't learn to combo, radius won't be worth it
[3:19:44] <+Scevda> @patstaresat one thing ill say is this. In a normal game of most types, you start at level 1. What level did you start at pat?
[3:19:46] <FlyguyJP> @RowenCleric And she wears in vacuum too, which seems super bad
[3:19:52] <Profmcstevie> How often do you have a big group of enemies, seems like 2 or 3 max
[3:19:52] <%jillyrancher> incendiary helps with combos cause burning enemies are vulnerable to biotic explosions
[3:19:54] <+alphonseisbest> @Sunstalker somehow shep's Brain was the only thing that survived
[3:20:08] <dekkitout> What's up with the Jean Grey Phoenix logo on Garry's armor?
[3:20:12] <%FunkyStreams> radius seems pretty situational
[3:20:13] <tattleworm> get yourself an ammo power maybe?
[3:20:14] <%coward_man> the helmet kept his skull intact
[3:20:23] <+Goraka91> I feel like the war taking centuries, even with how big space is, is weird because of how badly the Reapers kick everyone's ass
[3:20:32] <GustauveVIII> Warp > Biotic Charge > Nova=Melee
[3:20:34] <+unhuggable1> no idea
[3:20:34] <peachy996> Not really
[3:20:34] <tattleworm> oh my bad
[3:20:34] <%dave323dave> bc you are dying a lot
[3:20:36] <+RAWPowerStudios> Mansplaining is stronger on Saturdays.
[3:20:37] <Mattais88> Saturday maybe?
[3:20:37] <+Scevda> @dekkitout i think thats his old logo as archangel.
[3:20:37] <+unhuggable1> its annoying though
[3:20:37] <mr_saturday93> No idea
[3:20:38] <%Gogogolem> Its saturday
[3:20:39] <+ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So Epic just had A Plague Tale for free on their store. Is the game really that good? All I remember from your streams is you liking it
[3:20:39] <Meekest> Because you didnt play this one
[3:20:40] <%za7az> You started earlier today?
[3:20:40] <$Futurecity10> saturday

[3:20:43] <+alphonseisbest> yes
[3:20:43] <Profmcstevie> Saturday>
[3:20:43] <+RowenCleric> they kinda been backseaty in other streams Ive seen, was in epic namebros earlier and it was bad
[3:20:43] <%MightyDuckShoes> They know you never played it
[3:20:44] <FlyguyJP> Because ME3 brings out the worst in people
[3:20:45] <ape_hawk> cuz youre new to it
[3:20:45] <peachy996> It has many ways to fuck up
[3:20:46] <+Goraka91> No one streaming FF14
[3:20:46] <%EthorXL> This game is bad so it's harder to be right easilly.
[3:20:46] <%joodatious> maybe because u haven't played it i guess
[3:20:47] <+Gamblor69> Only one theyve played lol
[3:20:47] <+DracosMagala> Cuz its Javik
[3:20:47] <%MidnightBurst12> saturday afternoon?
[3:20:48] <+condemned_15> you're dying alot
[3:20:49] <heartlesshealer> because early playthrough
[3:20:49] <%hatok> people have an obsession with ME3 being "easy"
[3:20:50] <%LeiaSkynoober> I think people wanted to help with the turret stuff
[3:20:50] <ExpressNode> Because you told everyone you havent played this one
[3:20:50] <SaltyAzteca> cuz this is the final
[3:20:51] <%jillyrancher> protheans are unusual in how long they held out
[3:20:52] <DatAsuna> I'm only mentioning the new mechanics you're not using.
[3:20:53] <%Gorshum> Saturday
[3:20:53] <%Ranryu692> Saturday afternoon
[3:20:54] <%pilgrimsayswhat> its all the fluoride in the water
[3:20:54] <Zombrocom> It's the turret deaths I bet
[3:20:54] <%DrTomT18> you never played this one
[3:20:55] <Yuroshi> kids are out of school today
[3:20:55] <%UvBenServed> You're less familiar with this one?
[3:20:56] <+alphonseisbest> ME3 was the one that Mutiplayer PAT
[3:20:56] <SummonerMagno> people seem to get very deffensive about me3 not being perfect
[3:20:56] <karl_rex> Using Nova too much
[3:20:56] <%Monkeyweed21> you started earlier on saturday
[3:20:57] <dawarw0lf> Vanguard still need some weapons to help counter some Guys
[3:20:57] <peachy996> Grissom Academy for example you can fuck up
[3:20:57] <%gliph13> probably because this is a pseudo blind playthrough.
[3:20:58] <blackjack8182> You didn’t play 3
[3:21:01] <OldManDeckardCain> chat has been activated by EDI LUL
[3:21:01] <%jillyrancher> Cause 3 combat is actually good

[3:21:10] <+unhuggable1> oh yeah you said you hadnt played it

[3:21:52] <%Varlinator> Wha happen? LUL
[3:21:52] <%moonmintparadise> damn grenades made you HOP
[3:21:53] <%coward_man> @QueequegTheater places like that exist, apartments I looked at were done like that for weird reasons
[3:21:53] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Physics
[3:21:53] <SaltyAzteca> THAT RADIUS
[3:21:54] <OldManDeckardCain> pat, you are just doing a paige impression rn LUL
[3:21:56] <blackjack8182> Heal!
[3:21:57] <%shurtal> good ol' shephard in the box
[3:21:58] <Profmcstevie> not a bad range of those
[3:21:59] <chancho4tierra> easy is the new normal it seems
[3:21:59] <%jillyrancher> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[3:22:04] <peachy996> There you go
[3:22:04] <falyden> owned
[3:22:06] <%TheYellowcouch> C-C-COMBO
[3:22:07] <%jillyrancher> That was hilarious lol
[3:22:10] <%Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[3:22:12] <%FunkyStreams> lets run it again
[3:22:15] <heartlesshealer> that's better, you got two for one
[3:22:18] <%Taisuru> Big combo
[3:22:19] <FlyguyJP> Oh right, turrets explode destroying your shield
[3:22:25] <+RAWPowerStudios> awkward elevation I think
[3:22:32] <+beansoup> biotic charge can be quite buggy when someone is behind cover.
[3:22:37] <dawarw0lf> Thanks liara
[3:22:37] <Mattais88> Some ledges are inassesable
[3:22:39] <%ForlornCarton> I think it's the stairs
[3:22:42] <Profmcstevie> Oh god that jam on the screen on damage, that's never fun
[3:22:43] <tattleworm> you've gotta be able to see most of their model, yeah
[3:22:45] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat At least use a shotgun if you are gonna blast in
[3:22:47] <Sunstalker> NotLikeThis pat has a superfast cooldown on his Stinger now and it is breaking his brain
[3:22:47] <SaltyAzteca> CANT GET A LOCK
[3:22:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> elevation shenanigans
[3:22:53] <%Eaglestrike117> Elevation+ Nowhere for you to stand, pat
[3:22:58] <+Scevda> Behind cover below means no good line of sight
[3:23:00] <+Goraka91> That's called good game design
[3:23:02] <FlyguyJP> Pat is like a man with a Hammer names "Charge" and sees only nails
[3:23:04] <heartlesshealer> I think it's weird line of height, yeah
[3:23:13] <%TheYellowcouch> This shep is a no shotgun zone
[3:23:16] <dawarw0lf> Some times it’s a good idea to double charge and not nova
[3:23:20] <+wmeldrum> welcome back to mattock rifle the game
[3:23:28] <Profmcstevie> I think missing a charge in Mass Effect is like Shinesparking in Metroid with no roof
[3:23:34] <%jillyrancher> You can use shotguns and still be at 200
[3:23:34] <dawarw0lf> Not if you only hold a shotgun
[3:23:36] <OldManDeckardCain> pat, you can't totsugeki your way out of everything
[3:23:49] <dawarw0lf> Vanguard have some weight to then
[3:23:51] <%FunkyStreams> actually a shotgun woukd make more sense as your primary.
[3:23:51] <%DrTomT18> pat if you aren't going to use the proper weapon then don't complain that the game is too hard
[3:23:54] <+ScreamLord> Now by that much and even less if you use an Ultra-light mod on it
[3:23:59] <tattleworm> the weapon upgrading thing in the armoury'll decrease weapon weight
[3:24:00] <%intestinal_bleeding> Biotic dolphin
[3:24:00] <peachy996> Your shotgun would need mods to make it lighter
[3:24:06] <peachy996> You don't have that yet
[3:24:10] <supergoblinpunch> Unacceptible
[3:24:11] <DSD24> Guys be nice please
[3:24:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Has Pat explored the full citadel yet?
[3:24:16] <dawarw0lf> Because 5% is so good
[3:24:17] <FlyguyJP> HERE WE GO
[3:24:19] <Aiutare47> 195 is not bad at all
[3:24:19] <FlyguyJP> Chat why!
[3:24:20] <+Scevda> Cant wait for Pat to try to nova his way out of THAT enemy type
[3:24:20] <+OneGorillionDollars> chat I hope you are happy, you told him to go vanguard, you gave him these tools
[3:24:21] <Profmcstevie> 5% means nothing surely
[3:24:22] <%QueequegTheater> ...Pat, that 5% difference is like 0.03 seconds
[3:24:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Pffffffffff
[3:24:23] <DSD24> Vanguards can use all weapons
[3:24:24] <%za7az> Got 'em LUL
[3:24:25] <+Goraka91> Play optimally streamer reee
[3:24:25] <DatAsuna> Shotgun is not necesary for vanguards
[3:24:26] <+RowenCleric> ban hi

[3:24:30] <%Chichen> we're trapped in an endless cycle
[3:24:31] <%FunkyStreams> the game is hard.
[3:24:32] <Wolfstriker121> 100% CHATS FAULT
[3:24:36] <%TheYellowcouch> I'm very glad no one was there to complain about my pistol only stealth playstyle
[3:24:36] <KnightOfTrousers> I think some people here need a little hush hush
[3:24:39] <+RAWPowerStudios> Cognitive Distortions aren't real shut up.
[3:24:39] <DatAsuna> The powers matter more than the gun selection
[3:24:40] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Chat seems a bit cunty today
[3:24:40] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Pat getting gaslit
[3:24:42] <%SvenHolgersson> You people gunna get fucking emoted soon
[3:24:42] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat your beautiful
[3:24:44] <+rageoftheporo> ignore chat plz
[3:24:44] <dawarw0lf> Oh bou
[3:24:44] <%Varlinator> Just because game hard for YOU doesn't mean game hard for everyone else Pat
[3:24:45] <DapperCadavr> Were you having trouble before the turrets or is it just those that are effing you up?
[3:24:46] <PanicSwytch> Jesus christ chat, stfu
[3:24:47] <peachy996> I'm having big fun watching you die to turrets.
[3:24:48] <Meekest> You did it

[3:24:56] <%Mr_Pylon> chat being stumbo tonight
[3:24:56] <PaperyHornet1013> Gaslight
[3:24:59] <%coward_man> jesus we're trying to hit bedrock in the saltmines today huh chat?
[3:25:05] <EasternEagle21> Shotguns are not even the best weapon for Vanguard in 3. SMGs and assault rifles are both much better
[3:25:05] <+RAWPowerStudios> emote only mode.
[3:25:06] <samcast1> As wrong as pat is Chat is a different level of unreasonable
[3:25:07] <%Garthunox> pat you were getting hard countered
[3:25:09] <DatAsuna> @Eaglestrike117 on grissom IIRC
[3:25:09] <dawarw0lf> This will probably be the only mission this happens im
[3:25:11] <+lupomancer> gaslighting isn't real, you made it up because you're fucking crazy
[3:25:13] <%DrTomT18> citidal dlc gonna be a nightmare
[3:25:13] <%bread_assassin> @Eaglestrike117 Grissom, I think.
[3:25:16] <+Alig200> @Eaglestrike117 Grissom
[3:25:16] <+Goraka91> @DapperCadavr It's literally just the turrets and chat is freaking out
[3:25:18] <%jillyrancher> @eaglestrike117 Grissom
[3:25:24] <Meekest> USE YOUR SPECIAL EYES
[3:25:24] <$EsotericOdyssey> I didn't think so many people would get sweaty about the difficulty levels in mass effect 3
[3:25:25] <$Ziegsy> This chat must be a school bus with all these BACKSEATS
[3:25:26] <peachy996> Green Eyes
[3:25:26] <%Eaglestrike117> oh fuck he needs to go to grissom
[3:25:28] <%Monkeyweed21> MY BRAND
[3:25:29] <%QueequegTheater> Pat if you try to unga bunga an enemy type specifically designed to be anti-unga bunga of course it's going to seem harder than it is
[3:25:29] <%TheYellowcouch> Gatekeep, gaslight, chatroom
[3:25:32] <GuyverTypeL> Can't we just enjoy stream? kuruch1Bonk
[3:25:32] <%Eaglestrike117> The mattock is the KING OF AR'S
[3:25:33] <Lancaster_H> MY BRAND
[3:25:34] <FlyguyJP> @Sunstalker In the words of Mr. Incredible "You're Not Affiliated With Me!!"
[3:25:34] <+applemon198> what a mess of a game
[3:25:35] <Profmcstevie> SHEPARD ASSUMES CONTROL NOW
[3:25:35] <+ScreamLord> Listerine Powers Activate!
[3:25:38] <dawarw0lf> Man I’m trying to explain that all the difficulty’s are easier then in 2 but damn
[3:25:38] <%greasypete00> >:(
[3:25:40] <%barrakuta371> Shepard really does have special eyes
[3:25:41] <tanarath> Pat wants to crush the game, that's normal to him. we assume a challenge is normal instead.
[3:25:41] <%jillyrancher> JAVIK TIME
[3:25:43] <+AmericanSkidd> yes it is a cool gun
[3:25:43] <%Ranryu692> hell yeah it is
[3:25:45] <peachy996> Yeah that Gun rules
[3:25:45] <+rageoftheporo> pew pew
[3:25:46] <%Ranryu692> super OP too
[3:25:46] <Profmcstevie> Dang nice gun
[3:25:50] <%coward_man> wouldn't it be cool if you got that gun?
[3:25:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Wow shepard really does have special eyes O_O
[3:25:50] <%Varlinator> Particle Rifle SLAPS!
[3:25:51] <%saadi90> As Max would say: Shut up Chat! doodBait
[3:25:52] <SaltyAzteca> THAT WEAPON IS BUSTED
[3:25:54] <+Goraka91> Lasors
[3:25:54] <$EsotericOdyssey> GREEN BIOTICS
[3:25:55] <tattleworm> it's busted with incendiary ammo
[3:25:56] <%QueequegTheater> Green biotics
[3:25:56] <%TheYellowcouch> Protheans are so cool
[3:25:57] <peachy996> It's the basis of the Collector Beams
[3:26:03] <$EsotericOdyssey> GREEN BIOTICS GANG GANG
[3:26:04] <%coward_man> Prothean biotics are green because reasons
[3:26:04] <%Dopamien> no mods moon2PAIN
[3:26:05] <+ScreamLord> Lime Flavored Biotics
[3:26:07] <MarylandJutsu> heck yeah they did pat
[3:26:08] <falyden> laser beams!!!!
[3:26:08] <%OrangeMDT> Is this man crosseyed,
[3:26:08] <%FunkyStreams> yeah how did the Prothians no leave documentation of any of their weaponry.
[3:26:10] <Zombrocom> GREEN biotics
[3:26:11] <+Scevda> @tanarath at the heart of it all, this is the essence of the disconnect
[3:26:14] <karl_rex> Green biotics
[3:26:16] <+OneGorillionDollars> this game is miles easier than me3 because it lets you become WAY more broken
[3:26:19] <spongeofmystery> Legit, put armor piercing rounds in that gun and it becomes a death laser
[3:26:19] <Zombrocom> Protheans are GREEN
[3:26:22] <djblue_shift> dark channel is busted
[3:26:24] <+OneGorillionDollars> *me2
[3:26:24] <dekkitout> Pretty sure it's green apple flavored
[3:26:27] <GuyverTypeL> Monster. Energy Biotic colors
[3:26:28] <%bread_assassin> Man, why do Humans get the weakest Husk variant.  All the other ones are so much stronger.
[3:26:31] <%YakumoYomi> Protheans look dumb
[3:26:35] <dawarw0lf> @tanarath That might be it. The game is actually balanced some what. It s just that later in the game your a god
[3:26:36] <KnightOfTrousers> What accent is that irl?
[3:26:39] <%coward_man> note Pat: this is several centuries into the Reaper war for the Protheans
[3:26:41] <Meekest> Cooked em
[3:26:42] <%DrTomT18> toasty
[3:26:44] <FlyguyJP> OOF
[3:26:44] <mar_krow> Green stronger biotics
[3:26:44] <+AmericanSkidd> oof
[3:26:46] <+condemned_15> OOF
[3:26:47] <Jane_Lo> do we know how female protheans look? or they are all men?
[3:26:47] <dawarw0lf> Pat is not a god yet.
[3:26:47] <%Torus1025> Oof
[3:26:48] <%QueequegTheater> South African I think
[3:26:50] <%Mikewrobe> they look shark like
[3:26:51] <%Taisuru> There's only a million protheans?
[3:26:52] <KeystoneA2> @bread_assassin well technically there are adjutants...
[3:26:54] <GuyverTypeL> @knightoftrousers Jamaican maybe?
[3:26:54] <peachy996> Oh him touching that body is worse
[3:26:58] <%jillyrancher> The Reapers gather any technology of use and destroy it I think. vigil says it in 1. @funkystreams
[3:26:58] <Profmcstevie> THAT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TOTAL
[3:26:58] <%Ranryu692> @coward_man the game will tell him, dude. stfu
[3:27:01] <$Ziegsy> Protheans look like they eat their partners after sex
[3:27:03] <MarylandJutsu> Shits fucked pat
[3:27:06] <+ScreamLord> Particle Rifle is one of the heavier assault rifles so you won't use it LUL
[3:27:07] <+DracosMagala> He has a Nigerian accent
[3:27:08] <+beansoup> the fact that this was DLC is still fucking insane
[3:27:09] <+Goraka91> @Taisuru In that location
[3:27:10] <%YakumoYomi> That beam weapon is rad
[3:27:12] <peachy996> When you learn the thing Protheans can do
[3:27:20] <%joodatious> pat husks
[3:27:21] <+unhuggable1> no idea
[3:27:22] <%Torus1025> @profmcstevie Everyone else just died
[3:27:22] <+Goraka91> Drama
[3:27:24] <ape_hawk> for shits and giggles
[3:27:24] <%joodatious> we know this already
[3:27:25] <GustauveVIII> Terror
[3:27:25] <%CalderGaming> there was probably no time
[3:27:25] <KeystoneA2> Desperation is a hell of a thing.
[3:27:25] <DapperCadavr> they need ground troops to harvest
[3:27:27] <%QueequegTheater> To get more ground forces
[3:27:27] <T_Sasquatch> this is fine.
[3:27:28] <%Varlinator> There's 1 million prothean beacons on Jamaica
[3:27:28] <%YakumoYomi> To buy time, I guess?
[3:27:28] <mr_saturday93> No shut up
[3:27:29] <+Ches_Neckbeard> ground forces ensure that you get EVERYBODY
[3:27:29] <+Scevda> @coward_man he’ll get there narratively in a moment
[3:27:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> They talk about it
[3:27:30] <MarylandJutsu> shrug
[3:27:30] <%dave323dave> to fight against husks?
[3:27:30] <%Ranryu692> video game
[3:27:31] <FlyguyJP> Because Reapers need that DNA
[3:27:31] <dekkitout> Silly answer; shut up.
[3:27:31] <Profmcstevie> To keep them busy
[3:27:31] <%crazyspartan214> reaper kill everything
[3:27:31] <GuyverTypeL> Husks?
[3:27:32] <%SvenHolgersson> Cuz the writers didn't think about that
[3:27:34] <heartlesshealer> no one give detailed 3 lore to pat, first time playing
[3:27:35] <+Zyquux> They probably don't know that
[3:27:35] <%SaiyanShoto> desperation?
[3:27:35] <valriot> Because unconventional cant either and on foot is less visible
[3:27:36] <Profmcstevie> harvest and keep em busy
[3:27:37] <%TheYellowcouch> When you run out of toilet paper. your hand will do
[3:27:38] <DatAsuna> Because they don't want to miss anyone in any hiding spot
[3:27:38] <%za7az> For plot of course Kappa
[3:27:39] <stantheman_97> to get into small spaces
[3:27:39] <DSD24> Engineers are the bane of Vanguards
[3:27:40] <%Eaglestrike117> Because they need to be able to SCRAP
[3:27:41] <Zombrocom> To harvest
[3:27:41] <peachy996> That's more like it
[3:27:41] <spongeofmystery> @KnightOfTrousers Javik's VA is Nigerian
[3:27:41] <$EsotericOdyssey> seems like the reapers sent husks in
[3:27:41] <%gliph13> repress the harvest units
[3:27:45] <$EsotericOdyssey> gotta fight those somehow
[3:27:45] <SaltyAzteca> fear, it was a lost cause from the start
[3:27:46] <Luizabd> as a joke
[3:27:47] <+Goraka91> If this realistic the reapers would just kill everyone from orbit and there would be no game
[3:27:49] <peachy996> Priotize those engineers
[3:27:49] <FlyguyJP> Reapers wanna harvest DNA, gotta take their bodies intact
[3:27:49] <%hatok> they need to kill every single alien not just lots of them
[3:27:50] <%CalderGaming> or purely to buy time
[3:27:50] <+AmericanSkidd> capital ships cant get in underground bunkers
[3:27:50] <Kat_k> hard to load everyone up to be goo-ified with giant squid ships i guess?
[3:27:50] <Aeroallways> ships are easier targets I'd imagine
[3:27:51] <%Nested_Dreams> How does Liara know that these memories can open the pod now?
[3:27:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Reapers need to process organics' DNA to make more Reapers
[3:27:53] <spuginky> Reapers can't walk through doors
[3:27:54] <Zombrocom> They want the people for the goo
[3:27:57] <KnightOfTrousers> @KnightOfTrousers Awesome, thanks
[3:27:58] <%DrTomT18> to stop ground forces from using nukes n shit
[3:27:58] <+akscully> never stop charging
[3:27:59] <+RAWPowerStudios> What forces were you fighting just now? Those weren't reaper husks right?
[3:28:00] <Aiutare47> They want to process and harvest EVERYONE not just defeat them
[3:28:00] <%LeiaSkynoober> Lower morale and to destroy big canons
[3:28:02] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat The ground forces are mostly to fight civilian resistance and gather up civilians I think
[3:28:03] <%Solid_Stro> Gotta get all the hiding spots to make sure
[3:28:04] <%sniffy77> maybe they use ground forces to disable the big guns that may be effective against the bigger reapers
[3:28:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Probably the same reason we still uses foot soldiers even though we have tanks and helis
[3:28:04] <%coward_man> it's hard to get them big reaper arms into buildings and caves
[3:28:06] <Sp3ctre48> To get more bodies for the harvest but the real reason is that it would be too easy
[3:28:06] <+alphonseisbest> cuz that wouldn't make for a fun game
[3:28:06] <stantheman_97> also harvesting and distracting
[3:28:09] <mr_saturday93> My guess is that they thought repeated attacks in a specific spot or repeated attacks would weaken that structure
[3:28:12] <FlyguyJP> Reapers need that GOO
[3:28:13] <Lancaster_H> @Goraka91 but theyre not trying to kill everyone
[3:28:13] <%shurtal> Machine's are methodical, jobs not done untill they're ALL dead
[3:28:18] <%joodatious> bro how many reapers do they really need
[3:28:18] <%jillyrancher> harvesting
[3:28:19] <peachy996> NICE
[3:28:19] <valriot> LUL MELTED
[3:28:20] <Meekest> BRAPP

[3:28:21] <+RAWPowerStudios> That was a blink
[3:28:21] <%Eaglestrike117> Like sure you can nuke the planet but you need to have troops to be able to go into the caves an underground strongholds
[3:28:22] <+Goraka91> LUL

[3:28:38] <%TheYellowcouch> Pealed
[3:28:39] <tanarath> @dawarw0lf Granted, I disagree with Pat, I prefer Hardcore & Insanity, along with operating within the game mechanics and not just facetanking everything. but this is his playthrough.
[3:28:40] <%shurtal> knock knock, open up the door, it's BRRRRRRRRRT
[3:28:40] <%gliph13> was that even a SECOND?!
[3:28:42] <mr_saturday93> Yes machine guns are fucking powerful Pat
[3:28:46] <falyden> instant desth
[3:28:50] <migigglezz> thats a mood right there
[3:28:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Turret gor BRTRTRTRTRTRTRTRt
[3:28:52] <+Goraka91> @Lancaster_H Fair, forgot about their motivation
[3:28:53] <FlyguyJP> Stop him!
[3:28:56] <DatAsuna> you can stop them from putting the turrets down
[3:28:59] <djblue_shift> are the player placed turrets that strong jesus
[3:29:01] <PaperyHornet1013> Nova on turrets=bad
[3:29:01] <%jillyrancher> people forget they want to harvest organics, not just destroy them. ground forces can flush out people hiding
[3:29:02] <samcast1> caught off guard
[3:29:06] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Gun lytUSEGUN shotoPew
[3:29:07] <Aiutare47> Turrets are tough yeah. Powers make them much easier however
[3:29:08] <artoflec> turret sound elaMeltdown
[3:29:08] <mar_krow> Turrets r really good
[3:29:14] <DatAsuna> staggering an engineer mid deployment will stop the turret spawning
[3:29:14] <Profmcstevie> Do.....do any of OUR classes get turrets? I want a turret
[3:29:17] <+Scevda> He usedit
[3:29:18] <FlyguyJP> If you see an engineer slam down a turret, panic and kill that SOB
[3:29:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> GFJ
[3:29:20] <dawarw0lf> @tanarath Chat and me just need to shut up and let pat enjoy the game on HIS terms
[3:29:20] <peachy996> Turrets are strong.
[3:29:28] <%joodatious> maybe a hand canon would be good for your build. just get it to be as light as possible
[3:29:31] <cyclog> Gattling guns they kick ass now. They kick ass in the future. What a technology.
[3:29:31] <DatAsuna> engineers get drone turrets, but they're way weaker
[3:29:33] <Sunstalker> Oh god, it's the return of dropping your shield. Don't drop your shield though, pat
[3:29:34] <+Alig200> @Profmcstevie Engineers get a turret and a drone lol
[3:29:34] <MarylandJutsu> @Profmcstevie engineer
[3:29:34] <%jillyrancher> doing ok so far
[3:29:36] <%joodatious> that way you can to big sigular damage
[3:29:37] <%Varlinator> Today's lesson: Turrets = BAD
[3:29:38] <peachy996> They're a nuisance in MP situations. Not Hard but annoying
[3:29:39] <%TheYellowcouch> When will WE get a turret on the team?
[3:29:40] <+Goraka91> I am now vaguely recalling turret PTSD from the multiplayer
[3:29:40] <%SvenHolgersson> PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
[3:29:41] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:29:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you stagger the engineer before the turret is done deploying it will blow up
[3:29:43] <dawarw0lf> It’s not my Shepard. It’s pat’s
[3:29:44] <DatAsuna> that said the flame turret combos well
[3:29:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt now imagine what Tali got in 3
[3:29:44] <%DrTomT18> use your gun!
[3:29:45] <zhenthrim213> fuck
[3:29:46] <+beansoup> i love this so much LUL
[3:29:46] <%ahomeschooldropout> It's just this level is hard af
[3:29:46] <Zombrocom> Man, all we need to do to defeat the reapers are drop some turrets down in front of them
[3:29:48] <$Futurecity10> If you can nova, you shouldnt melee
[3:29:49] <GuyverTypeL> @patstaresat Does the evade movement work? maybe they are useful to dodge the turret fire
[3:29:49] <+Scevda> @dawarw0lf his terms can be pretty funny sometimes
[3:29:50] <+akscully> gotta overload them
[3:29:50] <%jillyrancher> Turrets are probably the deadliest thing Cerberus has lol
[3:29:51] <%lloyddboy> pat WILL charge EVERY turret and you CANNOT stop him
[3:29:51] <Profmcstevie> Turrets have unlimited Poise
[3:29:52] <%Torus1025> Need a techie
[3:29:53] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you might want to set Garrus' shortcut to Overload. It'll be much more useful than Proximity Mine
[3:29:54] <mesamus> pat you dont need to charge EVERYTHING
[3:29:54] <+akscully> not warp
[3:29:57] <DSD24> EDI is a really good helper for Vanguards
[3:29:58] <tanarath> @dawarw0lf Yeah, this is the game to him, so... eh?
[3:30:00] <%YakumoYomi> Did you use Overload the first time?
[3:30:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:30:05] <FlyguyJP> Because not at absolutely full health?
[3:30:06] <+OneGorillionDollars> patt whhhyyyy
[3:30:07] <%barrakuta371> Cause you used overload on the 1st turrer
[3:30:10] <DatAsuna> Garrus' overload would solve the turret problem yes
[3:30:12] <tattleworm> that was smooth
[3:30:13] <4DLuvOfLuthy> gotta get rid of the shield first, with overload
[3:30:15] <FlyguyJP> Tanking turrets is super risky
[3:30:22] <Aiutare47> It works in a vacuum. Not when you’re fighting multiple anything
[3:30:30] <%intestinal_bleeding> Zurrets
[3:30:31] <+Scevda> That was ultra smooth
[3:30:32] <tronhd> Using a drone/Turret as engineer is amazing
[3:30:34] <DSD24> Focus fire on all Engineers
[3:30:34] <Zombrocom> You overloaded it the first time
[3:30:39] <%joodatious> sadly Liara is a bad squad member for you. you'll probably need to switch to Tali once you get her again
[3:30:43] <+AmericanSkidd> nice one
[3:30:46] <%jillyrancher> you can't really be a DBZ character until you get more levels tbh
[3:30:48] <FlyguyJP> Pat is learning. Evolving.
[3:30:52] <tattleworm> downloaded
[3:30:53] <dawarw0lf> Ravages will also be a problem for pat later
[3:30:54] <%joodatious> not being able to take out shields is rough
[3:30:54] <DSD24> God that turret noise
[3:30:56] <valriot> The biotic and tech combos in this are SUPER strong
[3:30:58] <djblue_shift> further up
[3:31:01] <$Futurecity10> Liara is an amazing squad mate, she was on my party every single time on insanity
[3:31:01] <%jillyrancher> OH NO
[3:31:04] <Zombrocom> BRRRRRRRRT
[3:31:05] <RedPlasticCup> turret: FRTTTTTTTTT
[3:31:06] <%jillyrancher> RAVAGERS
[3:31:06] <+Scevda> @joodatious better waifu
[3:31:09] <%QueequegTheater> @joodatious Big wrong, warp->charge is super strong
[3:31:10] <+D00msDayDan> does the power wheel still have a radar?
[3:31:11] <%demiiluna> using charge as a finisher rather than an Opener seems to be the way to go
[3:31:14] <dawarw0lf> Turrets and ravages advise cover to deal with them properly
[3:31:16] <+Goraka91> I'm sure it'll see you before you see it
[3:31:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He's wrong
[3:31:24] <djblue_shift> what a SHAME
[3:31:26] <peachy996> Or Edi
[3:31:31] <+Goraka91> Tali? What a shame
[3:31:32] <KeystoneA2> Oh. No. Don't do that. Anything but that ;)
[3:31:32] <LVman037> pat who's your mass effect waifu and why? PrideLGBTea
[3:31:32] <FlyguyJP> Oh no... anyways.
[3:31:32] <+OneGorillionDollars> liara is good for everyone just for singularity alone
[3:31:34] <tattleworm> reave'll fix everything
[3:31:36] <%Rumbutt> imagine that
[3:31:36] <+Zyquux> OH NO NOT TALI
[3:31:39] <DatAsuna> Liara is fine as vanguard support, if you use her to set up combos
[3:31:43] <Profmcstevie> Oh how will I get over my blueberry keaving for my grape
[3:31:46] <%joodatious> @QueequegTheater he already has strong biotic stuff his weekness is shields
[3:31:49] <DatAsuna> but if she's left on autopilot then she sucks
[3:31:49] <%za7az> LUL
[3:31:50] <%QueequegTheater> He is learning THE FEAR
[3:31:51] <peachy996> Don't worry Pat! It's not like you'll be spending the entire game fighting Cereberus
[3:31:52] <%jillyrancher> Yeah shes mostly good for warp
[3:31:54] <%Torus1025> @futurecity10 Pat is already an S-tier biotic he n eds more tech
[3:31:55] <%TheYellowcouch> wait people actually care about synergy and don't just pick whoever they wanna bone
[3:31:58] <+akscully> overload the turret
[3:32:01] <Aiutare47> Liara is great for combo setup and crowd control
[3:32:01] <%somekindofsam> tali's only good against synthetics
[3:32:01] <+unhuggable1> oh yeah pull is actually useful in this i forgot
[3:32:02] <+Goraka91> Welp
[3:32:03] <dawarw0lf> Tail kinda sucks actually. Gameplay wises edi is better
[3:32:03] <+Ches_Neckbeard> singularity turbo fucks those shield guys and I love it
[3:32:04] <+kullumanati> Not blussy
[3:32:05] <+condemned_15> heal
[3:32:07] <blackjack8182> Heal
[3:32:07] <+AmericanSkidd> nailed it
[3:32:08] <$realm_forge> Shepard would be distracted by tali’s ass
[3:32:08] <zhenthrim213> Action roll
[3:32:09] <DatAsuna> singularity handles multiple shields at once
[3:32:10] <+Goraka91> PogChamp
[3:32:10] <+Scevda> Vindicator seems like a good of fit for pat so the harrier might be too.
[3:32:10] <SaltyAzteca> COMBATT ROLL
[3:32:14] <DSD24> Dodge roll feels good in this game
[3:32:15] <%dooscent> PROMOVES
[3:32:16] <tattleworm> yeah, don't underestimate side roll, really handy
[3:32:17] <%jillyrancher> Pat should get the Acolyte when its available
[3:32:17] <%QueequegTheater> @joodatious Without a second biotic you can't chain explosions
[3:32:18] <Zombrocom> COMBAT ROLL
[3:32:20] <+RAWPowerStudios> That guy was swimming on the floor!
[3:32:23] <%QueequegTheater> Which he is doing
[3:32:28] <+Scevda> There ya go, now your moving
[3:32:33] <FlyguyJP> The One-Two Punch!
[3:32:36] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt please heal
[3:32:36] <dawarw0lf> Liara and javik are best for vanguards
[3:32:41] <Profmcstevie> Garrus has armour piecing, would he be good for turrets?
[3:32:44] <valriot> Ironically, Kaiden fits you really well LUL
[3:32:45] <tattleworm> with reave you can be the first and second biotic
[3:32:45] <+condemned_15> they growing that DANK
[3:32:46] <DatAsuna> You can, biotics can detonate tech explosions
[3:32:54] <mesamus> ....
[3:32:55] <+Scevda> @profmcstevie yes
[3:32:56] <%QueequegTheater> You're at 40% health
[3:32:57] <djblue_shift> can't he cause explosions with incendiary and charge?
[3:32:57] <+akscully> you get so many medigel
[3:32:59] <PaperyHornet1013> Now your cooking with gas
[3:32:59] <+Goraka91> He might need them for the final boss
[3:32:59] <+Nahual_Amini> With concussion blast, too
[3:32:59] <heartlesshealer> it depends
[3:33:01] <peachy996> Mission is almost done you can use 1 up
[3:33:01] <+OneGorillionDollars> don't worry javik is VERY good for chaining explosions
[3:33:01] <+beansoup> LUL
[3:33:02] <GustauveVIII> You can set up your own detonations but its more tedious.
[3:33:03] <%Monkeyweed21> you get more
[3:33:05] <ThePrussianCyclops> Use Garrus skills
[3:33:07] <%Ranryu692> there are so many
[3:33:09] <heartlesshealer> only????
[3:33:11] <%jillyrancher> Heal pat you'll be fine
[3:33:12] <dawarw0lf> You get plenty
[3:33:14] <karl_rex> OMG only 4
[3:33:18] <+Scevda> but i only have 99 ether
[3:33:19] <SaltyAzteca> Use the megalixir
[3:33:19] <DatAsuna> @Profmcstevie He has AP, concussive, and overload making him good vs literally any type of defense
[3:33:21] <FlyguyJP> @Profmcstevie With a good gun yeah, add in a sniper rifle or a fast firing rifle and it would shred
[3:33:22] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You can trigger explosions with cryo or incendiary ammo
[3:33:23] <%Dopamien> NO ELPERS moon2POGU
[3:33:24] <notsoy> you get one like every five minutes, no?
[3:33:25] <%QueequegTheater> Might need it later Kappa
[3:33:25] <Aiutare47> Judging by your play style you need to be at max health as often as possible
[3:33:26] <%jillyrancher> mE3 is very generous with medigel
[3:33:29] <heartlesshealer> oh right pat gunned right for here
[3:33:34] <%gliph13> guy Remember! NUMBER GO DOWN.
[3:33:38] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat your loved your valid
[3:33:41] <+athuramn> HypeZap
[3:33:42] <%joodatious> this game gets surprisingly hard especially because of certain enemy types
[3:33:50] <+athuramn> HypeDerp
[3:33:53] <FlyguyJP> Number can NEVER go down.
[3:33:54] <DatAsuna> the explosion damage scales with your difficulty, so the higher you go, the stronger the explosions
[3:33:58] <%jillyrancher> cryo explosions are orgasmic
[3:33:59] <dawarw0lf> The combo system is big damage
[3:34:00] <+Alig200> doesn't medigel refill between missions in ME3?
[3:34:00] <%Dopamien> no help let the streamer suffer
[3:34:01] <+fetrigon> @paperyhornet1013 no he's not PunOko
[3:34:03] <+Scevda> @joodatious cant wait for them.
[3:34:06] <DatAsuna> combo explosions are latchkey for playing on hardcore or insanity
[3:34:12] <%QueequegTheater> D:
[3:34:12] <%joodatious> get ready for RE4 chainsawman deaths lmao
[3:34:14] <PaperyHornet1013> True
[3:34:14] <blackjack8182> Drop down
[3:34:17] <dawarw0lf> Combos do as much as a nova or charge
[3:34:18] <+condemned_15> DANK
[3:34:19] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can jump down from where the bridge is at toward the pod.
[3:34:19] <+Scevda> @alig200 i believe so
[3:34:22] <%lloyddboy> schut. da glas.
[3:34:23] <DatAsuna> You can literally quadruple your damage
[3:34:44] <+D00msDayDan> don't worry they can just skip all of it
[3:34:46] <+akscully> down
[3:34:48] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Do you know about Biotic combos?

[3:36:01] <%jillyrancher> Did you find all 3 laptops Pat
[3:36:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> pretty sure I get lost there every time too lmao

[3:36:18] <FlyguyJP> Hey Pat did you know about Biotic Explosions 4Head
[3:36:22] <%FunkyStreams> i guess thats Bioware when theyre tired at the end of a long week
[3:36:22] <SaltyAzteca> I have never used biotics, so i dunno anything LUL
[3:36:23] <%QueequegTheater> You started to do it more this mission
[3:36:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Pat, did you know that Final Fantasy 14 is free up until level 60?
[3:36:32] <%joodatious> @tattleworm let him FIGURE IT OUT HIMSELF
[3:36:33] <KeystoneA2> you're being indoctrinated pat
[3:36:33] <+Scevda> I choose not do it and make it harder on myself!
[3:36:33] <Profmcstevie> I feel like we need a fucking spreadsheet of "things pat knows already" some times
[3:36:34] <%jillyrancher> Pat did you know singularity and warp trigger explosions
[3:36:36] <%joodatious> for the love of god chat
[3:36:37] <Zombrocom> Did you know, if you pull the trigger, you shoot gun?
[3:36:41] <%joodatious> pat can learn it HIMSELF
[3:36:43] <PaperyHornet1013> You are loved pat
[3:36:44] <%coward_man> I missed 1 of them when I did 3 recently and oh my god having that side mission lit up was the worst
[3:36:44] <DatAsuna> @SaltyAzteca tech abilities have 3 other kinds of explosions too
[3:36:45] <dawarw0lf> I don’t think he knows. LETS YELL LOUDER. THAT SAVES THE PROBLEM
[3:36:46] <+AmericanSkidd> but what does pot of greed do?
[3:36:48] <tattleworm> shrug
[3:36:48] <%shurtal> Sadly, Shephard doesn't have any Cerberus Rocket booties, and thus can't survive a 8ft drop
[3:36:51] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Hey Pat drink some water
[3:36:51] <djblue_shift> sure will
[3:36:52] <%Dopamien> moon2PREGARIO mama mia

[3:37:17] <T_Sasquatch> hey pat, breathe
[3:37:19] <samcast1> Chat was really telling Pat some braindead shit earlier
[3:37:27] <+Scevda> Did you know John halo’s name is 117?
[3:37:28] <%jillyrancher> Pat did you know Turians have corkscrew penises and when Femshep fucks Garrus she spins?
[3:37:30] <%QueequegTheater> YEET
[3:37:33] <DatAsuna> charge isn't a primer
[3:37:39] <blackjack8182> Singularity on shields

[3:37:53] <%FunkyStreams> a well placed sniper bolt through the viewslot works tho
[3:37:55] <$EsotericOdyssey> I had bad taste when I was a teenager and only played Infiltrator or whatever the tech/weapons sniper stealth class was, and I always liked getting headshots through those shield viewports
[3:37:55] <%pilgrimsayswhat> stood him up lmao
[3:37:58] <%Monkeyweed21> HEAL
[3:38:03] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna no u
[3:38:04] <%jillyrancher> Pull removes thier shields
[3:38:07] <%Ranryu692> he did, it's that dark circle
[3:38:08] <mesamus> its on the wall
[3:38:09] <+Scevda> @funkystreams so fun
[3:38:09] <DapperCadavr> mine is such a bad skill
[3:38:14] <%Ranryu692> it blew up
[3:38:17] <%Dopamien> moon21 moon22 life is
[3:38:18] <%Dopamien> moon23 moon24 suffering
[3:38:18] <T_Sasquatch> this is so dumb LUL
[3:38:19] <%Ranryu692> proximity mine sucks
[3:38:23] <Profmcstevie> Do we have Reppuken as Vanguard in 3
[3:38:24] <+OneGorillionDollars> why would he heal when HE CAN PRESS Y
[3:38:24] <Lancaster_H> @EsotericOdyssey hey man, snipers in 3 feel good
[3:38:25] <%Dopamien> ruined 😡
[3:38:25] <peachy996> Mine is good just not for AI
[3:38:28] <MarylandJutsu> @Monkeyweed21 im sure pat loves you backseating him
[3:38:32] <%joodatious> @DatAsuna literally everyone including pat is telling you to stop backseat gaming
[3:38:33] <DatAsuna> mine is very not worth it yeah
[3:38:38] <T_Sasquatch> Glad i didnt pick vanguard , its so unga bunga
[3:38:38] <%jillyrancher> Did Pat spec Shockwave?
[3:38:44] <%Ranryu692> Overload is better as Garrus' shortcut
[3:38:45] <+AmericanSkidd> Is Legion just twitch chat playing Mass Effect
[3:38:48] <+alphonseisbest> pat how are u liking ME3 so far?
[3:38:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Lancaster_H my favorite rifle was that one that fired three shots at a time
[3:38:48] <FlyguyJP> @EsotericOdyssey That is not bad taste. Who doesn't love the feeling of a well placed shot exploding their stupid heads from behind their shield
[3:38:52] <tattleworm> yeah, having to wait out the duration in 2 made stasis kinda goofy
[3:38:53] <peachy996> Prox Mine is only useful in MP imo
[3:39:07] <TioXyco> @Profmcstevie nah, we got Round Wave now
[3:39:09] <+ScreamLord> No, shit in your armor like a hero
[3:39:12] <+vaderxyz1970> But....

[3:39:15] <%Ranryu692> @peachy996 true

[3:39:36] <%jillyrancher> Atlas Mech!
[3:39:38] <Sunstalker> @T_Sasquatch You can play it more tactical on harder difficulties and if you pick better new abilities for your lv30 start save. peepoSad
[3:39:39] <%FunkyStreams> uhhhh
[3:39:41] <%TheYellowcouch> ngl seeing you play this a bit fruther in is making me wanna give it a second chance
[3:39:43] <%crazyspartan214> F

[3:39:48] <zhenthrim213> shot in the back
[3:39:48] <dawarw0lf> I think the issue is how much everyone hyped up nova. It’s antipat
[3:39:48] <+OneGorillionDollars> I KNEW he would charge into the atlas LUL
[3:39:49] <%sniffy77> Im sure there are missions that introduce the mech
[3:39:49] <%jillyrancher> pat no
[3:39:50] <blackjack8182> Heal
[3:39:50] <+beansoup> you can do it pat we believe
[3:39:51] <mr_saturday93> Yeah mechs are a fuck
[3:39:53] <%barrakuta371> Ungad a little too hard there
[3:39:53] <zhenthrim213> like a coward
[3:39:58] <tronhd> I straight forgot they had mechs
[3:39:59] <+ViperMrk6> Heal
[3:40:00] <%FunkyStreams> never turn your ass to the enemy
[3:40:01] <Jaysky> Liara may have said to not let the mech get close but that doesn't mean WE SHOULDN'T GET CLOSE
[3:40:06] <%jillyrancher> You got a quad Pat
[3:40:09] <%zeroarturia> Kinda look like he died T posing
[3:40:10] <Profmcstevie> I hope headshotting mechs is as cool as in 2
[3:40:15] <Sunstalker> If you break the cockpit's shield, you can hijack that shit btw.
[3:40:16] <+unhuggable1> this game is so much more hectic than the other 2
[3:40:18] <+Scevda> The shepard rag doll is pretty consistently amusing.
[3:40:23] <Jaysky> The basic mechs are my favorite to fight in ME
[3:40:25] <%jillyrancher> @profmcstevie It is not.
[3:40:28] <PaperyHornet1013> Last part of the mission you can heal pat
[3:40:32] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[3:40:34] <Jaysky> Their headshots are satisfying
[3:40:35] <+fetrigon> UNGA
[3:40:35] <+condemned_15> shoot the cockpit
[3:40:35] <ThePrussianCyclops> It's working?
[3:40:37] <zhenthrim213> this looks dumb
[3:40:38] <Lancaster_H> @EsotericOdyssey mine was the big mcfuckhuge one, widow i think. "kill anything in this direction" guns feels good

[3:40:55] <peachy996> This is the Vanguard cycle I like to see
[3:40:56] <ThePrussianCyclops> IT'S WORKED
[3:40:57] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I can't believe you can just infinitely chain those abilities
[3:40:58] <+alphonseisbest> THAT IS A TRUE VANGARD
[3:41:01] <%jillyrancher> Once job Pat
[3:41:02] <DatAsuna> @ahomeschooldropout it was a single player only thing lol
[3:41:02] <Zombrocom> Vanguard is a hell of a drug huh
[3:41:02] <%Monkeyweed21> JUST 6S IT
[3:41:03] <mr_saturday93> Fun fact: if you aim at the cock pit you can ride the mechs
[3:41:05] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I played ME3 all wrong
[3:41:07] <Sunstalker> @ahomeschooldropout Sp too, just hard to happen
[3:41:07] <Aiutare47> Can’t believe you dodged that melee

[3:43:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> weird alien teef

[3:51:51] <+RJay80> javik is like look at this blue nerd
[3:51:51] <+unhuggable1> hes the strongest racist, stronger than ashley
[3:51:52] <%Ranryu692> is it racist if 10 minutes ago for him they literally were incapable of writing?
[3:51:54] <$KnivesEve> i cant believe this was regulated to dlc and not part of the full game
[3:51:55] <%YakumoYomi> "So you Asari finally learned to stop flinging your shit?"
[3:51:55] <%TheYellowcouch> Forerunner racism
[3:51:58] <+ScreamLord> What's it like being an Animus?
[3:52:01] <+Zyquux> This would be like if Ashley was the last survivor of humanity
[3:52:02] <+Scevda> Protheans are such good design
[3:52:02] <Sunstalker> Tbf, they were literal shit slinging primates back in his day. Like the target practice monkeys on tuchanka
[3:52:03] <%TheYellowcouch> The father of racism
[3:52:03] <dawarw0lf> This wheel should have had like 20 lines
[3:52:04] <heartlesshealer> He gives Ashley a run for her money. Just a bit less aggressive
[3:52:04] <FlyguyJP> I mean Protheans were basically slave masters lording over the rest of the galaxy OF COURSE they are racist
[3:52:05] <Zombrocom> Imagine if you woke up 50000 years later and dogs could talk
[3:52:09] <+D00msDayDan> @KnivesEve money
[3:52:09] <%Movemeister> He is the literally lucky racist
[3:52:10] <dekkitout> It's been 50,000 years- how long, short(?) did it take for Prometheans to develop?
[3:52:17] <MrPandastic> That's a super strong ability
[3:52:17] <+morkjac> !discord
[3:52:18] <Diet_z_dan> Hes not racist its just everyone inferior Kappa
[3:52:25] <Jaysky> "reapers"
[3:52:26] <peachy996> I'm astounded how he's DLC because at no point does he feel as non-essential as say Zaeed and Kasumi did
[3:52:33] <peachy996> He is always important
[3:52:35] <Profmcstevie> Possibly the fastest learners in the known galaxy still failed
[3:52:35] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout Reapers avoid killing lesser developed species
[3:52:43] <KnightOfTrousers> Assassin's Creed: Normandy
[3:52:47] <dawarw0lf> Because he was taken out and made dlc
[3:52:51] <%coward_man> Imagine that you go to bed, blink and suddenly dogs are in charge of shit
[3:52:55] <Daebunz> @peachy996 to be fair they only did the one dlc this time, but put way more into him
[3:52:58] <%jillyrancher> God fuck EA for cutting this guy out
[3:53:01] <%lloyddboy> CANNED FEELINGS
[3:53:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> From birth!
[3:53:04] <ARDM112> It's not THAT simple
[3:53:05] <+AmericanSkidd> it was probably like thousands
[3:53:08] <Yrefe> they hold them back for 100 years
[3:53:10] <FlyguyJP> I mean, complacency is a bitch
[3:53:10] <+Scevda> Indoctrination theory further hit
[3:53:11] <KnightOfTrousers> Seems to be genetic memory more than anything
[3:53:14] <+Midashu> Imagine sitting down on a toilet, the HORROR
[3:53:17] <Yrefe> you guys are losing after a week LUL
[3:53:18] <MrPandastic> I wonder what genius at Bioware thought it was a good idea to make Javik DLC. Cause fuck that guy.
[3:53:20] <mr_saturday93> Not that simple
[3:53:21] <%VioletHeart> It's transfering information, not understanding.
[3:53:22] <%bread_assassin> Protean schools musta been a breeze.
[3:53:25] <stantheman_97> different species evolve at different speeds
[3:53:27] <dekkitout> 50,000 years is a significant amount of time in terms of geology, it is not something to wave off
[3:53:27] <Profmcstevie> It WAS a century long war at least
[3:53:31] <Zombrocom> I mean we stole their junk
[3:53:31] <dawarw0lf> I’m curious what’s the original place this dlc was in the main game?
[3:53:33] <+Goraka91> HOW
[3:53:36] <%shurtal> Yedah he was

[3:53:52] <peachy996> WHY IS GRUNT NOT IN THE SQUAD
[3:53:54] <+Ches_Neckbeard> I Protheans fought the Reapers for 100's of years. The citadel races are about to be wiped out inside of a year

[3:53:58] <+Zyquux> What does he say if you never keep Grunt?
[3:53:58] <+Scevda> Fast tracked by the mass relays as you know
[3:53:59] <%Torus1025> @patstaresat The protheans are also limited by the laws of physics
[3:54:00] <+ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt To be fair, the Prothians basically being the Animus from Assassin's Creed probably propelled their development quite a bit
[3:54:01] <%TheYellowcouch> Walking UV light
[3:54:04] <Aiutare47> Yep
[3:54:05] <FlyguyJP> Javik is a walking proponent of Eugenics
[3:54:06] <%demiiluna> He was ordering those Fornax magazines in the Shadow Broker DLC I guess
[3:54:06] <ape_hawk> here it comes!
[3:54:08] <+Egg0fTheKing> All tech is based on reaper tech, everyone who encounters it jumps millennias of years ahead in technology. so they're all roughly the same

[3:54:16] <%AzureGale> DAMN
[3:54:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> @PatStaresAt The reapers usually invade once a species establishes a galactic government on the citadel. That means every cycle starts at a roughly similar point in a species technological development
[3:54:17] <peachy996> Grunt, Jack and Samara anger me on how they get left out.

[3:56:15] <+D00msDayDan> javik's specialty was charging headfirst into turrets
[3:56:18] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt Javik reeks of a character they came up with after they had written too much of the main plot, and having him know substantial stuff about the Protheans would have forced them to re-write too much, so they said fuck it, optional dlc
[3:56:21] <DianaTheAscian> so every cycle someone makes a robot race
[3:56:22] <DatAsuna> link the flame, shepard
[3:56:23] <%jillyrancher> That's such a great twist about Prothean civilization
[3:56:26] <Profmcstevie> We fought the reapers in a war we called "Beast Wars"
[3:56:26] <+Scevda> HEY EA THERES ANOTHER GAME IDEA FOR YOU YOU FUCKS
[3:56:37] <+CyanDeadEye> Javik is a Prothean Commander Shepard
[3:56:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "I forgot to nut in a lady prothean, so we failed" That guy, probably
[3:56:50] <PaperyHornet1013> They all died charging at turrets
[3:56:51] <%Deano8817> but it's day ONE
[3:56:52] <tattleworm> there was totally a prothean illusive man
[3:56:52] <+Goraka91> I dunno I love that he's just a jock
[3:56:55] <%QueequegTheater> I don't agree, but I see the argument
[3:56:57] <+beansoup> Javik was on DISC dlc made optional by EA
[3:57:02] <Profmcstevie> He knows SO much, he'd derail most plots
[3:57:04] <Jaysky> So like the asari right nowe
[3:57:04] <+alphonseisbest> thats not what happened
[3:57:05] <ARDM112> He was actually the Catalyst in the original plot, they had written shit about him OUT
[3:57:07] <Sunstalker> @DianaTheAscian What, you expect them to not try to make sexbots? Kappa
[3:57:09] <%jillyrancher> I strongly disagree with that
[3:57:16] <%Mikewrobe> "choice"
[3:57:17] <dawarw0lf> I’m sure EA was a part of it too
[3:57:18] <ExpressNode> "choice"
[3:57:20] <+Krecart> A "choice"
[3:57:21] <ThePrussianCyclops> "choice"
[3:57:23] <peachy996> I see the argument in a later part of a dlc mission
[3:57:24] <+AmericanSkidd> Thanks guys very cool
[3:57:24] <+alphonseisbest> EA made them rip it out
[3:57:28] <mr_saturday93> Too stupid to kill
[3:57:33] <heartlesshealer> mmmmmmm
[3:57:34] <%jillyrancher> I love hes just a soldier who knows nothing really
[3:57:35] <thewrathofscience> Technicall,they were right
[3:57:39] <%Ancopro> we did used to kill people for weather
[3:57:49] <Thepothero> Monke brain saved us from da reapers
[3:57:58] <%DrTomT18> it's heavily implied in background text that the Reaper Invasion is about 1500 years overdue in this cycle. I believe Sovereign planned to use the Rachni to open the Citidel relay.
[3:57:58] <FlyguyJP> So the reapers likely took a pass by Earth and were like "Not yet.... but soon." And left.
[3:58:09] <%Mr_Pylon> damn they did way better than the current galaxy
[3:58:10] <$KnivesEve> wheres tali if i may ask
[3:58:18] <+Krecart> That it lasted for centuries is wild to me considering how fast the Reapers are kicking everyone's asses right now.
[3:58:24] <peachy996> Tali is busy elsewhere
[3:58:26] <+AmericanSkidd> Stories of a Holy Prothean Empire surfaced

[3:58:53] <+Totally_Not_Toby> those definitely weren't protheans hahahahaaaaaa
[3:58:54] <FlyguyJP> @DrTomT18 Right, the insects on the Citadel were supposed to open the citadel gate but were bioengineered to never do that, stalling their invasion.
[3:58:56] <ThePrussianCyclops> NO
[3:58:58] <DatAsuna> false hope
[3:58:58] <DianaTheAscian> a new even old race

[3:59:57] <Jaysky> You sound like BITCHES
[3:59:57] <peachy996> Getting him to touch that Memory Shard is a murky decision. I like that detail but I feel like Chat will ruin it for PAt
[4:00:02] <KeystoneA2> Those statues on Ilos technically weren't even the Innusannon, they were huskified Innusannon by the looks of it.

[4:00:47] <FlyguyJP> HOW does he know what the Salarians refer too
[4:00:50] <%jillyrancher> As brutal as Javik's viewpoints are, I think it's unfair to judge him too harshly. he has known nothing but war and loss, where mercy genuinely can just get you killed.

[4:04:57] <generalve> it is
[4:04:57] <heartlesshealer> honestly probably just wanting to remember his voice
[4:04:58] <%TheYellowcouch> It's BROMANTIC
[4:04:58] <%dooscent> it is yeah
[4:04:59] <supergoblinpunch> It can be
[4:04:59] <tukds> very scummy
[4:04:59] <DatAsuna> it can be, yes
[4:04:59] <GustauveVIII> The gay doesn't happen until his shit is resolved.

[4:05:01] <Meekest> Not yet
[4:05:01] <peachy996> We are all alone in chat
[4:05:01] <RedPlasticCup> no
[4:05:02] <Jane_Lo> femshep says that too
[4:05:02] <+DracosMagala> no
[4:05:02] <+Goraka91> No but yes but maybe
[4:05:02] <Yrefe> not tyet
[4:05:02] <+denizen_conspirator> bald shep has some intense stares
[4:05:04] <%DrTomT18> you'll know
[4:05:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Want some new peen? Since the old peen is in a cold room
[4:05:05] <+beansoup> Cortez is a romance option yes but being friendly to him is good :)

[4:05:07] <KnightOfTrousers> Better to be nice cause holy shit
[4:05:07] <%chill_o_wisp> DON'T BE MEAN
[4:05:07] <AngryAsian5> Not yet
[4:05:07] <xeros720> time for a romantic cancel
[4:05:09] <%Varlinator> It's a GOOD FRIEND line
[4:05:09] <%bread_assassin> It's not binding, let's say.
[4:05:11] <%Deano8817> it leads to it but you can pivot away
[4:05:11] <Zombrocom> It can be
[4:05:11] <+Mr___Pillow> we'll bang okay
[4:05:12] <dd44dostivei> you're his co
[4:05:12] <%joodatious> you'll be fine pat
[4:05:12] <%Gorshum> KappaPride
[4:05:13] <GuilKato> dont worry you wont lock out tali
[4:05:13] <+RainFerret> You have to select a very specific choice to start a romance with him
[4:05:13] <+AmericanSkidd> it can be platonic
[4:05:13] <generalve> HAHAHAHA
[4:05:14] <4DLuvOfLuthy> it wont put you in a romance
[4:05:15] <+CyanDeadEye> It starts it, but it doesn't commit
[4:05:15] <heartlesshealer> more sad/grieving than romantic
[4:05:17] <Botman_R> There's another option later on
[4:05:18] <DatAsuna> Nothing locks in romance until the one convo where they ask you straight up
[4:05:20] <+tinytinykittycat> be nice
[4:05:20] <%snugglepuggs> Safe as a condom Pat
[4:05:20] <%SvenHolgersson> NOW KISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[4:05:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Cortez and Traynor are the gay options in 3
[4:05:21] <ThePrussianCyclops> lol
[4:05:22] <%QueequegTheater> KappaPride
[4:05:22] <zhenthrim213> WE ARE ALL ALONE WTF IS THAT LINE
[4:05:24] <mr_saturday93> Add some dreads on him and he'll be Woolie
[4:05:24] <$Ziegsy> hes legally bald
[4:05:26] <+Scevda> Its okay to do
[4:05:26] <Halospaz117> It won't lock you in
[4:05:27] <%Ranryu692> FemShep even says the same line there
[4:05:28] <Heyestus> He's  bald on the inside
[4:05:29] <%jillyrancher> I dont think so it's pretty clear what the romance is
[4:05:29] <PaperyHornet1013> It’s not
[4:05:29] <blackjack8182> We are all alone
[4:05:32] <dawarw0lf> I’m here for you but not that pen
[4:05:33] <peachy996> Seeya STEEEEEVE
[4:05:34] <GohansBeforeHohans> scjLaugh
[4:05:35] <+kortin> "Hey man, I'm bald, I kinda understand you"
[4:05:36] <tukds> His pet gay
[4:05:39] <+Totally_Not_Toby> they buried it the most
[4:05:42] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> EA games come with pre-buried gays
[4:05:42] <mr_saturday93> BALD
[4:05:42] <+DeaconBluesClues> don be nice to other men pat thats gaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
[4:05:43] <peachy996> I don't like him.
[4:05:45] <generalve> TV Tropes intensifies
[4:05:47] <+RJay80> Widowed Gay
[4:05:48] <%QueequegTheater> It's a bit much
[4:05:49] <DatAsuna> Right by the elevator
[4:05:51] <%joodatious> people are allowed to be sad pat
[4:05:52] <Deasmeister> Pre buried
[4:05:52] <willyfreshness> so you can get gay rebound
[4:05:53] <%DrTomT18> yes
[4:05:53] <Meekest> There were no gays in the writers room
[4:05:54] <DracaenaLeaf> yes
[4:05:56] <%Ranryu692> Well how else would they let you know that he's gay AND single?
[4:05:56] <+Totally_Not_Toby> noooo, no way
[4:05:56] <%TheYellowcouch> You saw what they did for autistic people
[4:05:56] <%subparSamaritan> It's embarrassing
[4:05:56] <FlyguyJP> Yeah, SUPER on the nose
[4:05:56] <Mattais88> And the gay girl is hitting on the robot
[4:05:57] <%CalderGaming> in this particular situation there are buried people all around
[4:05:57] <peachy996> This is one reason I don't like him, his writing is bad
[4:05:57] <+Goraka91> Let's introduce the fact he's gay with his already dead boyfriend
[4:05:58] <+AmericanSkidd> I would be sad if they buried my Gay too
[4:05:58] <generalve> it is
[4:05:58] <%crazyspartan214> it a bit much
[4:05:59] <notsoy> same dudes that wrote a black guy who cheats on you at the first opportunity
[4:05:59] <Heyestus> Gay people are allowed to grieve, Pat.
[4:05:59] <+akscully> his dead husband from a few months ago!
[4:06:00] <%SvenHolgersson> They had the shovel ready while writing
[4:06:01] <heartlesshealer> yeah =T
[4:06:02] <+PenmanLupine> big trope
[4:06:03] <+DarkJaguar124> Shepard's his rebound
[4:06:04] <%hatok> so many other characters have had someone important to them die but the gay character it's literally one of their two traits
[4:06:04] <%snow_bush> But how else would you know he's gay though?
[4:06:04] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's not hamfisted CW writing at aaaaaall
[4:06:05] <dawarw0lf> I find it cringe
[4:06:05] <MarylandJutsu> OH EXTREMELY
[4:06:06] <%Gorshum> It drives me so nuts, for real.
[4:06:06] <DatAsuna> he's literally waiting to ambush you with his trauma
[4:06:08] <+Midashu> Should've made James gay
[4:06:08] <heartlesshealer> yes and yes
[4:06:10] <dawarw0lf> It’s weird
[4:06:10] <peachy996> The gay guy in Andromeda is WAY WORSE though
[4:06:13] <+D00msDayDan> what you expect them to be tactful about telling you he's gay?
[4:06:13] <kjb343> his husband got fridged
[4:06:15] <%jillyrancher> not really
[4:06:16] <ExpressNode> Are they immortal or something?
[4:06:17] <+Zyquux> daily reminder that Jack should've been bi
[4:06:18] <DatAsuna> F
[4:06:18] <FlyguyJP> Oh fucking god Jacob
[4:06:20] <+xerioes> killed 1 half of the gay on the jump
[4:06:24] <peachy996> Somebody should tell Pat about Gil
[4:06:24] <%capnbeefs> Turian balls
[4:06:27] <AngryAsian5> Hey
[4:06:29] <Jaysky> Ey
[4:06:29] <%Monkeyweed21> HE NEEDS TO BE FREE FOR YOUR DICK PAT
[4:06:29] <Aiutare47> I like Cortez but they went hard on the “See gay inclusion! He’s super gay!”
[4:06:29] <heartlesshealer> oh god the Andromeda gay man oh noooo

[4:06:39] <+geekjacob> why does that voice sound familiar
[4:06:39] <peachy996> Gil in Andromeda is the most fucked up writing for a gay character imo
[4:06:39] <%tank7013> Oh he can just bang one of his weird cyber hookers
[4:06:39] <+D00msDayDan> wrex.

[4:06:52] <%joodatious> @D00msDayDan why would you need to be tactful about telling someone your gay? he literally brings up his husband the way someone would their wife
[4:06:53] <%Taisuru> wrex
[4:06:54] <%MidnightBurst12> ey
[4:06:54] <alwayspronking> Rex
[4:06:55] <dekkitout> Shepard
[4:06:56] <%za7az> Grunt
[4:06:57] <mr_saturday93> E
[4:06:58] <+CyanDeadEye> Infinite ammo
[4:06:58] <DatAsuna> I forgot about gil lol
[4:06:58] <@commanderclaw> The particle gun slaps tho
[4:07:01] <+Scevda> Hai
[4:07:02] <%Solid_Stro> Ey
[4:07:02] <dawarw0lf> I love garrus’s “later”
[4:07:02] <%Ranryu692> because it's busted
[4:07:03] <+Goraka91> PEW PEW
[4:07:04] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god Pat, just settle for 195
[4:07:04] <tattleworm> upgrading'll decrease the weight if you want
[4:07:05] <%Solid_Stro> Shepard
[4:07:07] <%DrTomT18> use shotgun
[4:07:07] <+akscully> upgrade it and get the weight down
[4:07:10] <%Solid_Stro> Grunt
[4:07:15] <generalve> dlc weapon is OP as fuck
[4:07:15] <dawarw0lf> Or the other “not right now”
[4:07:15] <%jillyrancher> tbh I prefer this over what ME2 did when characters had no new dialogue
[4:07:15] <+Totally_Not_Toby> you gotta get those lightweight materials, that's where the shit's at
[4:07:18] <%joodatious> not a great weapon for vanguard
[4:07:22] <%joodatious> takes time to do big damage
[4:07:23] <mesamus> its heavy cause its incredibly powerful
[4:07:23] <%za7az> Shepard
[4:07:25] <%king_wragles> Is the 5% really that much?
[4:07:25] <%DrTomT18> that 5% is OK
[4:07:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> Yea, Cortez' entire questline is "my HUSBAND who is GAY is DEAD and the ONLY way I can feel better is your DICK Shepard also I'M GAY"
[4:07:35] <%QueequegTheater> Pat, just use a light shotgun
[4:07:35] <peachy996> Hey Chat what if you romanced a guy who got his best gal pal pregnant and wants to raise the child together with her?
[4:07:37] <%jillyrancher> Ready for the next mission?
[4:07:38] <+akscully> avenger II will be lighter, etc
[4:07:42] <peachy996> Wouldn't that be great?
[4:07:42] <Aiutare47> 5% is nothing
[4:07:45] <%jillyrancher> Not right now.
[4:07:46] <+AmericanSkidd> what is the difference between 200% and 195% on a 5 second cooldown?
[4:07:52] <+ScreamLord> Yet
[4:07:52] <%jillyrancher> Commander.
[4:07:52] <dawarw0lf> Check your times on coldown and see the change. It updates the mene
[4:07:54] <+Krecart> You don't need 200%, Pat.
[4:07:54] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S LESS THAN 0.01 SECONDS
[4:07:55] <+akscully> you have to buy the upgraded version
[4:07:56] <+D00msDayDan> just use the thing you don't have yet, duh
[4:07:56] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's only five percent, pat
[4:07:57] <notsoy> upgrades can make them lighter, a good investment
[4:07:59] <GustauveVIII> You can go into the Spectre Requisition shop to see if you missed any items from past missions right now.
[4:07:59] <%za7az> Use it anyways Kappa
[4:08:00] <%pipboy344> It's the best weapon in the game Pat
[4:08:01] <blackjack8182> Find a good pistol
[4:08:02] <Aiutare47> Honestly anything above 150% is great
[4:08:03] <Profmcstevie> 5% weight is light as hell
[4:08:05] <Jaysky> -as a coincidence?
[4:08:06] <+Krecart> The cooldown is so short you're probably already at the limit.
[4:08:10] <+tinytinykittycat> light enough
[4:08:10] <+Goraka91> @Krecart But the goblins
[4:08:10] <SaltyAzteca> Shepard
[4:08:11] <falyden> the acolyte
[4:08:13] <%jillyrancher> pat 195 is perfectly fine
[4:08:14] <dawarw0lf> Check the stats before and after
[4:08:14] <tattleworm> upgrade the scimitar once and it'll be 200%
[4:08:14] <DatAsuna> those are actually relatively light for the shotgun class
[4:08:16] <+Totally_Not_Toby> oh yeah, upgrading them does make them lighter, i forgot
[4:08:16] <%QueequegTheater> Katana
[4:08:18] <+katarjin> Shotgun best weaaponn? oook
[4:08:19] <mesamus> pat your 5% is hitting your goblins too hard
[4:08:22] <dawarw0lf> The menu will update
[4:08:22] <Aiutare47> Pat the sliders goes to -200%
[4:08:24] <+galaktic> go to the citadel shooting range and test them if oy uwant
[4:08:25] <+DracosMagala> Upgrade your guns
[4:08:26] <%lloyddboy> rune scimmy
[4:08:27] <Profmcstevie> You are losing literal microseconds at 5%
[4:08:30] <+ScreamLord> Do you not have any of the Ultra-light mods for shotty?
[4:08:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Skimitar
[4:08:31] <DatAsuna> Most shotguns weigh more
[4:08:31] <thewrathofscience> schimitar is full auto i think
[4:08:33] <%jillyrancher> Scimitar for life dude
[4:08:33] <%pipboy344> USE PARTICLE
[4:08:37] <+Scevda> Light shotgun is on next mission or at the shops
[4:08:39] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[4:08:42] <%jillyrancher> SCIMITAR BOYS UNITE
[4:08:45] <%joodatious> I remember back in the day people whined about Cortez's gayness yet he's basically just any grieving character who happens to be gay
[4:08:49] <DatAsuna> yeah scimitar is spray and pray
[4:08:51] <@commanderclaw> I wish ME3 had a training range to test shit out
[4:08:51] <mr_saturday93> Which has a better fire rate?
[4:08:53] <%bread_assassin> Didn't Pat get the +5% cooldown bonus?
[4:08:53] <%pipboy344> PARTICLE RIFLE GANG
[4:08:55] <%Hitman0257> particle is beam rifle
[4:08:57] <%Aleate> Skimatar
[4:08:59] <dawarw0lf> Not it’s semi
[4:09:01] <GustauveVIII> 5% recharge speed is too minimal to be noticable
[4:09:02] <dawarw0lf> And fast
[4:09:03] <peachy996> Remember you can go to the Citadel and test your guns
[4:09:05] <%jillyrancher> biggest clip of any shotgun
[4:09:08] <%Hitman0257> yes

[4:09:24] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 And recharge speed
[4:09:25] <+ScreamLord> The Particle Rifle is THE best gun in the game pretty much
[4:09:28] <%capnbeefs> Shoot bangs on the citadel
[4:09:38] <DatAsuna> they're a lot less noticable now
[4:09:39] <generalve> Femshep makes scars horny

[4:09:58] <DatAsuna> Oh yeah, javik's respec is bugged

[4:10:12] <DatAsuna> without mods
[4:10:14] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 Oh wait he can’t check his charge tho
[4:10:16] <%gliph13> I think the "Regular" stores should be unlocked now at the Citidel.

[4:15:37] <%jillyrancher> Citadel
[4:15:45] <peachy996> You cannot gay date Javik. But if you're Femshep you can have a drunken one night stand with him
[4:15:45] <DatAsuna> P sure that's a repurposed MP map yeah
[4:15:48] <%jillyrancher> Go shopping first
[4:15:48] <%Varlinator> get that  Jellyfish Goo
[4:15:53] <GustauveVIII> shields
[4:15:57] <%gliph13> I vote take a break on Citadel to stock up on Guns and upgrades and Side missions.
[4:16:01] <%demiiluna> PUNCH HARDER
[4:16:04] <%Ranryu692> some of the level 6s are tough, and some aren't LUL
[4:16:04] <mesamus> pat remember academy is timed
[4:16:05] <MarylandJutsu> yalll let him just follow the guide
[4:16:06] <KeystoneA2> Academy's more important, plus you can also pick up a little trinket to turn in at the Citadel
[4:16:06] <DSD24> You want the Melee
[4:16:06] <Profmcstevie> Shockwave could be helpful for shield cerberus grunts perhaps
[4:16:09] <OldManDeckardCain> omg, they botched the strive latam evo so  much they just skipped it after 2 matches and now it's tekken time LUL
[4:16:09] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt  you gonna give the particle beam a test run?
[4:16:09] <GustauveVIII> shields for less horrible deaths
[4:16:10] <%chill_o_wisp> melee
[4:16:11] <PaperyHornet1013> You can talk to people on the citedal between missions
[4:16:12] <tattleworm> i'd say durability
[4:16:15] <+akscully> pay, you need durability
[4:16:16] <DatAsuna> your recharge is already  fast and the bitoic punch is the weakest heavy melee
[4:16:16] <peachy996> 3 says no to gay aliens, You can only enjoy the alien d if you're a woman
[4:16:19] <%Aleate> The recharge speed on the melee is nice
[4:16:19] <peachy996> I hate it
[4:16:22] <SneakyCorpse> smash SMOrc
[4:16:22] <+tinytinykittycat> do you punch a lot of dudes
[4:16:24] <+Totally_Not_Toby> you're gonna want the shield for shockwave stuff
[4:16:26] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah

[4:17:37] <%Ranryu692> is that why things are rough today? no mods?
[4:17:38] <mr_saturday93> You don't fail the academy unless priority set
[4:17:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> But Pat what about Space Burger King? That's super timed! @patstaresat
[4:17:39] <%joodatious> literally just shut up chat ur annoying

[4:17:42] <dawarw0lf> Yeah
[4:17:45] <+AmericanSkidd> we are building a consensus
[4:17:46] <+katarjin> Dog snores are great
[4:17:46] <%bread_assassin> LUL LUL LUL
[4:17:50] <peachy996> There's a reason people are going crazy about Grissom Academy but they are being unreasonably impatient

[4:18:01] <%unstablebeast19> @patstaresat ngl, I think most people know academy isn't THAT timed, and just wanna see you do it sooner because it's a great mission, but damn man, this is alot
[4:18:03] <PaperyHornet1013> A wise man fears a calm mans anger
[4:18:03] <MarylandJutsu> so everyone, just LET PAT play the gameee
[4:18:04] <%snugglepuggs> snugglepuggs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Hey Pat did u know u can still play the ME3 multiplayer still on PC and Xbox and it’s still super alive? I would recommend playing it on PC with the native controller support mod and cheat engine to get creds for the loot boxes they use for progression.
[4:18:05] <$KnivesEve> emoji time
[4:18:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> @AmericanSkidd And our consensus is terrible.
[4:18:07] <notsoy> put zangief on the mic and stop reading chat

[4:19:05] <%jillyrancher> shes even better in Citadel
[4:19:08] <%bread_assassin> The worst part of it is that chat's 100% wrong about the timing of Grissom Acadamy, too.
[4:19:09] <dawarw0lf> Like I understand the concerns BUT ITS TOO MUCH GUYS
[4:19:09] <heartlesshealer> okay, but does Jack still have her cool Alternate Costume?

[4:20:31] <%jillyrancher> give him his particle rifke

After they added the DLC and the extended ending, the game became 85% good. DLC isn't a fix all, but it's by far the best DLC of the whole series.

[4:21:45] <+AmericanSkidd> @Mattais88 The ones who are giving bad advice who believe they are right
[4:21:45] <%Torus1025> He's a summoner
[4:21:45] <%miguelrod777> BabyRage BabyRage
[4:21:47] <%Solid_Stro> Dad, I blame you psaWhat
[4:21:47] <%toastchi> He Busted
[4:21:48] <olaksi> broken DLC character?
[4:21:50] <dawarw0lf> It’s green
[4:21:53] <samcast1> If assault rifle doesn't weigh anything, should you take it?
[4:21:54] <%superstarsage> Got that DLC shine
[4:21:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh it's just Force Lightning
[4:21:57] <%DrTomT18> pull is very useful again cerberus
[4:21:57] <+OneGorillionDollars> POWAH
[4:22:02] <dawarw0lf> He’s cool
[4:22:09] <blackjack8182> Lift Grenade op
[4:22:11] <%Deano8817> i need more POWER
[4:22:11] <+Goraka91> BabyRage Play on ''Normal'' difficulty
[4:22:12] <Heyestus> Kavik aas so good they pulled him out to be a pre-order bonus
[4:22:13] <notsoy> I NEED MORE POWER
[4:22:15] <%Gloom_Tangerine> There’s a story on kotaku if anyone’s interested. With video evidence
[4:22:15] <%jillyrancher> pull is great against cannibals
[4:22:17] <dawarw0lf> Damage
[4:22:17] <%Aleate> Look at those multiplayer abilities Kappa
[4:22:22] <TioXyco> UNLIMITED! POWEEEEEEEER!
[4:22:26] <GustauveVIII> max dark channel
[4:22:27] <peachy996> You've got the power
[4:22:27] <dekkitout> Rage of the Ancient? Is Javik just Space Rage?
[4:22:27] <dawarw0lf> And then more damage
[4:22:34] <tattleworm> wise
[4:22:34] <KeystoneA2> it's pretty good
[4:22:35] <silkoh> Just saw that Trevor Moore of "Whitest Kids U Know" has died
[4:22:38] <olaksi> that's a real gamer move
[4:22:40] <%joodatious> yeeee
[4:22:41] <+Goraka91> @Gloom_Tangerine Well it's Kotaku so
[4:22:41] <GustauveVIII> duration
[4:22:41] <+Krecart> Damage
[4:22:43] <heartlesshealer> Dark Channel really does sound cool
[4:22:44] <DatAsuna> The best part is because bioware didn't bother to do base damage scaling, these bonuses all scale on total damage for some busted max outputs
[4:22:48] <%jillyrancher> I wanna quote Citadel DLC but dont wanna spoil it
[4:22:55] <%joodatious> duration better
[4:22:56] <%JamesCorck> Duration and that was you max out it's duration.
[4:22:56] <Sigma_190_Beta> Duration is good.
[4:22:58] <dawarw0lf> Damage
[4:23:01] <%bread_assassin> Someone do the math.
[4:23:02] <+AmericanSkidd> duration is more damage effectively
[4:23:04] <heartlesshealer> both are good, considering it's a DoT
[4:23:05] <+akscully> duration
[4:23:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> The duration is already an extremely long 30 seconds
[4:23:07] <dekkitout> Big number or big time number
[4:23:12] <KeystoneA2> this power is good no matter what
[4:23:14] <%Deano8817> duration for boss fights damage for mooks
[4:23:14] <+akscully> duration and recharge
[4:23:15] <%gliph13> Broken, Darwinist, and Green.       The Woolie would aprove.
[4:23:16] <+Totally_Not_Toby> exactly
[4:23:17] <%joodatious> duration always means more damage
[4:23:19] <ARDM112> Nothing is gonna live for 45 seconds anyway
[4:23:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Longer Duration = More dmage over time
[4:23:25] <+Krecart> You're gonna be killing stuff pretty fast.
[4:23:26] <%Jmann1892> Big Number or Do Combo
[4:23:26] <DatAsuna> Damage is only good if you're doing combos because of the multiplicative scaling
[4:23:26] <%lloyddboy> if they die before duration is over then it is moot
[4:23:29] <dawarw0lf> It can go either way
[4:23:31] <Profmcstevie> They are both damage in the long run, but that damage comes faster on Damage
[4:23:33] <dawarw0lf> Both are good
[4:23:34] <@commanderclaw> I can see either
[4:23:37] <%ahomeschooldropout> Trust me, an entire group of enemies is gonna live for 45 seconds later in the game
[4:23:37] <Meekest> Go with your instinct
[4:23:38] <heartlesshealer> it chains, so yeah maybe duration
[4:23:38] <Mattais88> If anything encounter lasts that long when your supermaning around
[4:23:42] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt Dark Channel also works for biotic combos
[4:23:45] <%jillyrancher> Woolie would pick Synthesis just cause its green.
[4:23:45] <heartlesshealer> they're both good
[4:23:46] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @goraka91 yeah, but the videos from the players are pretty damning
[4:23:49] <%Ranryu692> you won't always have enough enemies to jump for the full 45 seconds
[4:23:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> Go Duration.
[4:23:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt 54*45 is more than 33*60
[4:23:54] <%bassoontyphoon> But what about the prizzzzze
[4:23:54] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Make sure you go to the med-bay when you can to get your bonus ability of AP ammo
[4:23:54] <PaperyHornet1013> Believe in yourself pat
[4:23:57] <%dooscent> that's virulent walking bomb from dragon age
[4:23:59] <+tinytinykittycat> duration deals more damage
[4:23:59] <tanarath> You can just recast after 5 seconds
[4:24:00] <olaksi> read your goddammn tooltips people
[4:24:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Yeah whoever is saying that sounds dumb
[4:24:01] <DatAsuna> But it will be off cooldown within that duration and can still jump several
[4:24:02] <dawarw0lf> Pats right here
[4:24:02] <+AmericanSkidd> but what does pot of greed do?
[4:24:03] <%rockcentuar> reset on jump
[4:24:03] <SaltyAzteca> thats a little busted lol
[4:24:04] <tattleworm> dark channel's good no matter what you pick, go nuts
[4:24:04] <DatAsuna> Either is fine though
[4:24:06] <+akscully> recharge
[4:24:06] <%JamesCorck> You can almost knock down 5 guys in a row with that duration.
[4:24:07] <dawarw0lf> Do duration
[4:24:07] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt but does the timer reset?
[4:24:11] <%snugglepuggs> richkidMentor richkidMentor richkidMentor
[4:24:11] <Profmcstevie> If it's good there'll never be enough enemies to feed it
[4:24:12] <Heyestus> I don't  believe it chains more than once.
[4:24:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> You're gonna be using biotic denotations anyways so the damage doesn't matter
[4:24:15] <+Totally_Not_Toby> either one is good, but honestly an entire combat encounter lasting 45 seconds is abnormal
[4:24:16] <%jillyrancher> dark channel triggers combos right
[4:24:16] <%rockcentuar> timer reset on jump
[4:24:16] <%shurtal> this feels like a 6 of one, half a dozen of the other sorta situation
[4:24:17] <dekkitout> You want duration or range for those kinds of effects when games offer it
[4:24:19] <%Ranryu692> you have that backwards
[4:24:20] <%GalacticaPhanto> @gloom_tangerine I mean it's just screaming but they aren't obviously saying it. it's still fucking hilarious
[4:24:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Slow is great here.
[4:24:21] <%QueequegTheater> Recharge to use a different ability
[4:24:23] <%joodatious> probably recharge
[4:24:25] <%Ranryu692> that's why you go damage LUL
[4:24:27] <%EthorXL> Slow would be funny to watch
[4:24:29] <DatAsuna> @ahomeschooldropout is he though?
[4:24:29] <+Zyquux> but it lets him use his other powers sooner
[4:24:30] <notsoy> slow, it has almost no recharge time as it is lol
[4:24:32] <heartlesshealer> slowing enemies is for fun
[4:24:34] <+Zyquux> global recharge
[4:24:54] <peachy996> Good practice mission for Javik
[4:24:55] <dawarw0lf> MP map
[4:24:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> Alliance Pull Out Kings
[4:25:00] <+Atilac54555> Trevor Moore had died, co-founder of “the whitest kids u know”
[4:25:01] <tattleworm> multiplayer nostalgia incoming
[4:25:03] <DatAsuna> @ahomeschooldropout also detonation damage scales from the base damage of the 2 powers that make it, so damage is relevant. Either option is good though.
[4:25:05] <dawarw0lf> One of my favorites
[4:25:11] <+Atilac54555> *has
[4:25:16] <%lloyddboy> RIP

[4:26:05] <OldManDeckardCain> toilet pat will become a final boss for the next generations
[4:26:06] <peachy996> It's one of the better maps
[4:26:07] <Jaysky> It super is. I remember it cause this area could be a bitch
[4:26:08] <+CyanDeadEye> I have the urge to play ME3 Multiplayer now...
[4:26:09] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah, it hink all the N7 stuff is multiplayer maps
[4:26:09] <%joodatious> cant wait till pat gets THE SHOTGUN
[4:26:11] <Profmcstevie> Pat would die in a failed transfer to the toilet body
[4:26:12] <scrumbotime> I will never die and no one can prove me wrong because if I die I won't be there to be proven wrong haha
[4:26:15] <+OneGorillionDollars> damage shotguns in this game generally feel much better than me2
[4:26:16] <peachy996> Yeah Hazard version is Baller
[4:26:22] <DatAsuna> Oh yeah I forgot you can biotic phase through that wall lol
[4:26:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> WKYK is legit an amazing show
[4:26:27] <%QueequegTheater> He was the Grapist
[4:26:32] <dawarw0lf> All the hazard maps are goat
[4:26:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> They did the abe lincoln YOU DONE FUCKED UP skit
[4:26:34] <%Monkeyweed21> from like the late aughts
[4:26:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> Abe Lincoln is the best
[4:26:40] <+kekkerscrew> We all die, what matters is what we leave behind.
[4:26:41] <+CyanDeadEye> My best memory is trying out all the N& classes on this map.
[4:26:43] <anAngryHamster> WHO THE FUCK SAID!?
[4:26:46] <Wolfstriker121> DAMN HE WAS 41 too fucking young to pass away rip
[4:26:49] <DatAsuna> the acid rain hazard map was the best tho
[4:26:56] <DatAsuna> wet concrete aesthetic
[4:27:01] <dekkitout> My favorite was the cooperate war skit
[4:27:10] <2deep5u> what is that charging spell called?
[4:27:12] <blackjack8182> Died too young
[4:27:14] <KeystoneA2> Never got to play the DLC MP maps.
[4:27:16] <%Garthunox> OH! They the people who did the "RACE WAR! CMON!" bit?
[4:27:18] <zhenthrim213> What are you doing "hanging out with black people
[4:27:20] <peachy996> My memories of this map are choke points and holding the line in these hallways
[4:27:23] <KeystoneA2> Noveria and Tuchanka were my faves
[4:27:27] <+OneGorillionDollars> i recharges every mission
[4:27:28] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can manually resurrect Garrus by going near his body.
[4:27:31] <%QueequegTheater> Yes you would, medkits restock between missions
[4:27:32] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You can rez without medigel
[4:27:32] <Jaysky> But you would have had 2 more
[4:27:35] <+Zyquux> can't you manually pick squad mates up anyway
[4:27:36] <%Monkeyweed21> it refills every mission in 3
[4:27:40] <peachy996> Also this is where most of my turret deaths came from
[4:27:42] <%QueequegTheater> RESTART
[4:27:43] <%hatok> doesn't medigel come back each mission
[4:27:43] <Profmcstevie> Don't you super elixir this argument Part
[4:27:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @PatStaresAt It restocks every single mission dude
[4:27:45] <dawarw0lf> My favorite is the mods that add In the other dlc maps
[4:27:49] <karl_rex> I think you can run up and revive teammates
[4:27:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh man time to touch your squad a lot

[4:29:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pat you lie, I think they're very attractive
[4:29:01] <%QueequegTheater> If you suck the tentacle like a dildo is it gay
[4:29:02] <stantheman_97> some people definitely think so
[4:29:02] <%blaccbird914> this is really making me miss the multiplayer
[4:29:04] <generalve> The fisherman's wife Kappa

[4:29:09] <RedPlasticCup> no
[4:29:10] <+AmericanSkidd> no, do it like three more times
[4:29:12] <DatAsuna> yeah the n7 missions are very low effort
[4:29:13] <%Ranryu692> It's just a combat mission made out of a MP map
[4:29:16] <blue8moon> they're cool
[4:29:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> HAHAHAHA
[4:29:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> AHAHAHAHA
[4:29:18] <%joodatious> @QueequegTheater no
[4:29:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> LUL
[4:29:24] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There's some data pads around the level for dumb lore that "might" have extremely minor relevance.
[4:29:25] <+kekkerscrew> Hanhar don't have Bones, how can they be hot?
[4:29:27] <1faber> i don't think patrick is a shitty name
[4:29:27] <godila2> they are "big stupid jellyfish"-shepard
[4:29:31] <%pilgrimsayswhat> These N7 missions are super low effort DLC
[4:29:34] <peachy996> These are just simple combat missions
[4:29:39] <+KShirahama> N7 missions are to introduce multiplayer maps
[4:29:42] <dawarw0lf> We are the Geth I noticed
[4:29:42] <CrimsonGargoyle> that was a fucking great one Pat LUL
[4:29:46] <%TheYellowcouch> If you showed off Elmo it could be a Catrick
[4:29:50] <+Scevda> I immediately became defensive and obtuse, this is soooo audience’s fault
[4:29:57] <%joodatious> shields
[4:29:57] <DSD24> I like this shotgun
[4:29:58] <$Futurecity10> shields
[4:29:58] <%QueequegTheater> Shields
[4:30:01] <+akscully> it is absolutely to get you familiar with MP
[4:30:02] <DatAsuna> because he has a shield
[4:30:03] <%Ranryu692> Biotics don't do much to Shields
[4:30:07] <+OneGorillionDollars> biotics dont to a lot of damage top shields
[4:30:08] <%snow_bush> Shields
[4:30:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> shields
[4:30:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> Shields.
[4:30:11] <+Goraka91> It's literally singleplayer multiplayer it's dumb
[4:30:13] <Mattais88> Dosn't have shield damage boost yet
[4:30:15] <+akscully> oh boy
[4:30:17] <%joodatious> oopsies
[4:30:17] <%octavian_wolf> shields stop biotics
[4:30:18] <studleydoorite> brave
[4:30:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> Biotics do nothing on shields.
[4:30:18] <%Ranryu692> Overload is the most useful ability in the game
[4:30:18] <%QueequegTheater> The turrets are aimbots
[4:30:21] <DSD24> Foiled again by Turrets!
[4:30:22] <%subparSamaritan> Turrets: The Bane of Pat
[4:30:23] <+Goraka91> Good one turret chan
[4:30:23] <DatAsuna> Shields are the vanguard's bane
[4:30:24] <%Taisuru> Unga did not bunga
[4:30:25] <Profmcstevie> Turrets strike again
[4:30:27] <dawarw0lf> It’s a slow dot
[4:30:30] <+Zyquux> gotta shred shields first
[4:30:32] <karl_rex> Biotics aren't effective against shields
[4:30:32] <dekkitout> Oh it's that kind of debuff, wack
[4:30:33] <%subparSamaritan> Damn you turrets!
[4:30:33] <+denizen_conspirator> the enemy of pat, turrets
[4:30:34] <DatAsuna> luckily garrus has a hard counter to shield
[4:30:36] <+Scevda> Shields, what an amazing conceot
[4:30:38] <%joodatious> its to make you're attacks stronger pat
[4:30:41] <dawarw0lf> The revenge of the turrets
[4:30:42] <Aiutare47> Stop unga turret
[4:30:57] <blackjack8182> Stop tanking the turrets
[4:31:01] <DSD24> Pat needs to get the freeze and fire ammo's to get more mean
[4:31:02] <+AmericanSkidd> we also dont know what the damage or health numbers are
[4:31:04] <Profmcstevie> Mean? Have you seen this series? You float people then blow their heads off
[4:31:11] <KnightOfTrousers> Guys, calm the f down
[4:31:13] <KeystoneA2> Gotta hit unshieled/unarmored targets with it for good effect
[4:31:13] <%QueequegTheater> ????
[4:31:14] <PaperyHornet1013> If the reapers just used turrets pat would stand no chance
[4:31:22] <KnightOfTrousers> Honestly I'm amazed there hasn't been any emote only mode tonight
[4:31:28] <Dangan12> dont tell me dark harvest must kill to jump to another enemy
[4:31:29] <Doomstar16> "I'm sorry...." -TACKLES INTO THE WALL.-
[4:31:38] <Profmcstevie> What if the Prothean technology is just a REALLY BIG Turret
[4:31:43] <DatAsuna> I forget, if you prime with a biotic then hit it with carnage, is it a biotic or a fire combo?
[4:31:44] <+Krecart> Let's be real: the turrets are like the most dangerous thing in this game.
[4:31:44] <%QueequegTheater> PAIGE
[4:31:47] <peachy996> why didn't you ask?
[4:31:49] <%QueequegTheater> WHY

[4:32:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> RIP mods
[4:32:09] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat sabatoging Paige!
[4:32:11] <tukds> stealing viewers

[4:32:17] <%SaiyanShoto> *Sabotaging
[4:32:19] <PaperyHornet1013> Paige pulled a pat
[4:32:27] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat confirmed saboteur
[4:32:28] <$Ziegsy> hopping over for the intro.
[4:32:30] <+Scevda> Everybody streaming today!
[4:32:34] <FassieFons> couch time for pat
[4:32:36] <+Krecart> That is a Good Question
[4:32:38] <%joodatious> noo pat shud uppp
[4:32:39] <%LeiaSkynoober> Hell yeah I'm excited to watch Paige soon
[4:32:41] <+akscully> that's the neat part, you are!
[4:32:43] <+Goraka91> It takes a few days
[4:32:43] <+AmericanSkidd> you just pick itup
[4:32:44] <%QueequegTheater> You're super tough
[4:32:46] <%Garthunox> She did tell you
[4:32:46] <+unhuggable1> u are
[4:32:49] <olaksi> because of the Echo pat
[4:32:50] <blue8moon> because shut up
[4:32:51] <Profmcstevie> Just lick reaper tech
[4:32:52] <+cermo55> becuse you don't live with it
[4:32:56] <%Ranryu692> it takes a bit
[4:32:57] <stantheman_97> you are Kappa
[4:33:02] <dawarw0lf> Cuase your strong
[4:33:08] <karl_rex> Thats why the theory was so popular
[4:33:14] <%sniffy77> A ballsy move bioware could of done is make a random member of your team secretly indoctrinated
[4:33:15] <+Scevda> Indeed, why ARENT you.
[4:33:29] <dawarw0lf> Do the horde mod pat
[4:33:31] <macavells> You aren’t indoctrinated for the same reason the Grey Warden party doesn’t die from Darkspawn evil radiation
[4:33:32] <tanarath> @patstaresat Indoctrination is subtle, the reapers will benefit from a shorter galactic conflict
[4:33:33] <+Scevda> @sniffy77 thats way too interesting
[4:33:38] <karl_rex> Its ridiculous how much reaper tech you're exposed to
[4:33:42] <%bassoontyphoon> Wait for the bussy mobile to pick you up
[4:33:45] <macavells> Also because endings that completely invalidate your agency sucks
[4:33:45] <+AmericanSkidd> you just took his face, OFF
[4:33:51] <%gliph13> it does take a few days, but it's hard to justify "Arrival". Shepard was near a reaper devise for nearly 2 days!

[4:34:34] <+Scevda> @gliph13 not only that but unconcious and imunocompromised
[4:34:34] <ARDM112> Indocrination Theory contradicts everything established about indocrination since ME1. Indoctrination is subtle, yes, but you do notice it and no, you don't hallucinate.

[4:34:43] <%General_Terro> now this is the kind of content i come here for
[4:34:53] <dawarw0lf> If Shepard was indoctrinated then he’s WEAK AS FUCK
[4:34:54] <ARDM112> You can literally hear the Reapers whispering to you
[4:34:58] <+Scevda> @ardm112 you dont know shit
[4:35:01] <+katarjin> These are great
[4:35:07] <%Brunty1234> Brunty1234 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! keep up the good work goblin man
[4:35:20] <olaksi> The "main character was brainswashed all along" is not usually as good a twist as it seems at glance
[4:35:26] <dawarw0lf> Shepard has a much more strong mind then saren or IM
[4:35:26] <olaksi> especially in video games
[4:35:40] <ARDM112> @Scevda TI is pure copium that was only supported by people who didn't play attention or didn't play ME1 at all, deal with it
[4:35:47] <peachy996> Yes but you are swimming in Reaper tech through the whole series
[4:35:47] <Heyestus> indoctrination theory is Bioware endorsed COPE for shit ending.
[4:36:00] <dawarw0lf> Taking the time to tell chat to CALM DOWN. I’m reminded of woolie’s halo streams m
[4:36:02] <peachy996> You spend 3 games worth around Reapers and reaper tech
[4:36:18] <+Scevda> @olaksi thus why you KNOW the writers fucked up when people are begging that twist to be true over the original ending.
[4:36:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Indoctrinate deez nuts star kid
[4:36:30] <DatAsuna> It is a big reach, but it sure beats the control ending
[4:36:32] <Heyestus> they added bits to try and reinforce it because someone online wrotw a better ending than they could.

[4:37:11] <blackjack8182> Good job page!
[4:37:16] <@PeachSaliva> @agnibrandt I do but the save file we need is on his account
[4:37:17] <+lemon_lore> why doesn't she have her own?
[4:37:17] <%Ranryu692> dafuq
[4:37:22] <DatAsuna> it was his spawn point
[4:37:24] <%Solid_Stro> Pat holding Paige’s stream hostage
[4:37:24] <SilverFaustX> evo online is a mess "Due to technical and network issues, we’re unable to broadcast " kek
[4:37:24] <+Zyquux> Shoulda just used Origin for ME Kappa
[4:37:27] <%gliph13> I will watch her stream....BEGRUDINGLY!

[4:37:39] <@PeachSaliva> @gliph13 that’s the spirit!! Lmaoo
[4:37:45] <%Ipsenscastle> aw damn I missed FOUR and a half hours? WTf
[4:37:51] <%AgniBrandt> @PeachSaliva Are you sure it won't work on yours? I recall DS3 saves disappearing every time I make a new computer so it MIGHT not be tied to the account
[4:37:53] <+OneGorillionDollars> this game give you A LOT of weapons you get better ones
[4:37:54] <Doomstar16> So close to being dead.
[4:37:58] <%king_wragles> It doesn't really have the right kind of 'oomph' to it
[4:37:58] <ARDM112> @Scevda You can accept the plot for what it was (bad, starting as far as back as Mars) or you can try making up stuff that contradicts the established lore because you can't aaccept that reality.
[4:37:59] <peachy996> Can do the Tuchanka arc proper next week, and chat can keep pestering Pat about Grissom Academy
[4:37:59] <DatAsuna> yeah the capcity is too low for what I like in a semi auto
[4:38:00] <Profmcstevie> Is it time to wiki dive for "best shotgun"
[4:38:05] <%YakumoYomi> My butt itches
[4:38:08] <%AgniBrandt> I might be wrong, but I feel like they're not account bound
[4:38:10] <peachy996> Never stop pestering pat about Grissom Academy
[4:38:20] <+Zyquux> Claymore is the best shotgun, right?
[4:38:22] <SilverFaustX> @PatStaresAt evo online is a disaster
[4:38:22] <%MidnightBurst12> that dodge roll looks so goofy
[4:38:24] <dawarw0lf> All the first weapons are garbage

[4:42:15] <%tank7013> @ARDM112 And it was established that it's more subtle the more useful they want you to be. Saren had no idea he was fully under
[4:42:23] <%MidnightBurst12> brazil is one giant faraday cage
[4:42:26] <ExpressNode> He just turns into a blue puddle
[4:42:30] <peachy996> get you ass in the kodiac
[4:42:30] <MarylandJutsu> heal by touching his dick
[4:42:36] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's fine
[4:42:40] <+Totally_Not_Toby> don't worry about it
[4:42:40] <dawarw0lf> Your still going on about the theory?
[4:42:42] <peachy996> get in the ship and escape this mission
[4:42:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's fine.\
[4:42:48] <%dooscent> this was my least favorite MP map
[4:42:49] <%joodatious> Vanguard is incredibly difficult in MP i remember having to save ALOT of bad vanguard players who just chard
[4:42:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> Don't worry about it.
[4:42:52] <+OneGorillionDollars> It's their as another location for multiplayer
[4:42:52] <%QueequegTheater> That one smells funny
[4:42:52] <+denizen_conspirator> wonder if pat knows his charge gives him a shield recharge
[4:42:59] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this game is definitely finished
[4:43:04] <dawarw0lf> You only get two
[4:43:05] <%Taisuru> We're free!
[4:43:05] <peachy996> Sounds neat
[4:43:11] <Doomstar16> See ya later buddy
[4:43:12] <mesamus> @denizen_conspirator its why he does it
[4:43:14] <karl_rex> Cerberus can have one reaper relic as a treat
[4:43:14] <%joodatious> @denizen_conspirator i hope this is a joke..
[4:43:15] <MarylandJutsu> Paige needs to die at dark souls
[4:43:17] <heartlesshealer> it's okay
[4:43:19] <%sniffy77> Sounds like a good way to get ur best techs indoctrinated
[4:43:20] <MarylandJutsu> shes doing the DLC now right?
[4:43:23] <+Scevda> Staying near it makes your brain tinglw
[4:43:30] <+CyanDeadEye> Haha, MP reference
[4:43:33] <GuilKato> pat try right click on steam and go offline
[4:43:36] <DatAsuna> We'll keep doing MP rounds
[4:43:51] <%subparSamaritan> No Signal!
[4:43:53] <ARDM112> @tank7013 Saren knew he was directly connected to Sovereign. The subtle part was him thinking he could fight it, just like Benezia and everybody else did. But he knew Sovereign was influencing him. Shepard would be aware at least to some extent he's compromised before Reapers could exert enough control.
[4:43:54] <%joodatious> bring us back to the orb
[4:43:54] <DatAsuna> that attempt to make MP canon falls apart as soon as you pick geth
[4:43:57] <%Treuan> Panic!
[4:43:57] <%HotSauceFiend> is the stream over?
[4:43:59] <%Taisuru> FUCK YEAH
[4:43:59] <%Ranryu692> @MarylandJutsu Nameless King first
[4:44:00] <+Scevda> @datasuna fun!
[4:44:04] <%joodatious> word UP
[4:44:08] <dawarw0lf> GET THAT GALACTIC READINESS UP
[4:44:08] <SilverFaustX> no paige needs his login
[4:44:08] <%YakumoYomi> THERE'S NO TIME, PAT!
[4:44:08] <%gliph13> Welp time to do some quick chores!
[4:44:24] <DatAsuna> "oh no the geth are defending this cerberus lab"
[4:44:27] <+Alig200> @DatAsuna how so?
[4:44:32] <dawarw0lf> @ardm112 I think this better spent in whispers
[4:44:32] <%joodatious> @DatAsuna no shut up tho they are good geth
[4:44:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> I was gonna say why doesn't he write it down but I already know the answer
[4:44:33] <ARDM112> @tank7013 Nobody to my knowledge ever got indoctrinated fully unaware. I don't think even in the books.
[4:44:33] <+Scevda> What is she gonna play?
[4:44:34] <MarylandJutsu> ohh riiiight nameless
[4:44:50] <SilverFaustX> i find it hilarious that a online only fighting tournie broke down
[4:44:52] <%joodatious> remember you were able to play as awakened collectors in MP
[4:44:54] <%DrTomT18> I return
[4:44:57] <DatAsuna> And if you go on platinum mode, every faction is there at once
[4:44:58] <%joodatious> and other Volus!
[4:45:01] <DatAsuna> making it even sillier
[4:45:22] <peachy996> Phantoms and Banshees and Turrets oh my
[4:45:22] <%joodatious> those were hell
[4:45:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> Also this stream was a fucking mess thanks to y'all but it's super on brand
[4:45:26] <+Scevda> But fun!
[4:45:26] <dawarw0lf> I wanna see Pat try platinum difficulty and be told it’s normal for the shits and lols
[4:45:28] <%DrTomT18> @joodatious yeah, shame those didn't show up in canon in some way or another
[4:45:31] <DatAsuna> Remember the specific volus trick on that lab map that bioware had to patch out by closing the first objective room?
[4:45:36] <peachy996> And then a Praetorian shows up
[4:45:46] <+Scevda> Cant wait for pat to have to adapt to a bandhee
[4:45:50] <+AmericanSkidd> I am leaning into Chat just being a bunch of defective Geth Programs super hard
[4:45:50] <%joodatious> @joodatious i mean they kinda are?
[4:45:51] <+Scevda> Oops banshee
[4:45:55] <SilverFaustX> SourPls
[4:45:56] <DatAsuna> 4 volus stacked in that room together could beat the whole thing, only ever moving for objectives
[4:46:02] <dawarw0lf> Pat will definitely be instakilled by banshees later for sure
[4:46:10] <%joodatious> pretty sure it shows up in war assets and such
[4:46:16] <DatAsuna> Everyone gets banshee grabbed a few times
[4:46:21] <%DrTomT18> yeah, if Pat doesn't start using more guns he is going to have a hell of a time with some later game enemies like the Banshee and shit
[4:46:21] <peachy996> Pat will likely have a better time against...the Ban...nevermind
[4:46:22] <dawarw0lf> We are Geth for we are many
[4:46:23] <%joodatious> pats gonna get killed even more by phantoms
[4:46:26] <+katarjin> @Scevda Those were fun onm Leg
[4:46:29] <DatAsuna> and given his headbtt playstyle, he might even get brute grabbed
[4:46:33] <peachy996> I forgot about what NOT to do against Banshees
[4:46:34] <%joodatious> those are the REAL killers when you're vanguard
[4:46:44] <dawarw0lf> Pat was told to use only powersz it’s not his fault
[4:46:47] <DatAsuna> Or atlas grabbed
[4:46:51] <DatAsuna> that was relatively rare too
[4:46:52] <peachy996> Oh Sync Kills.
[4:46:53] <%DrTomT18> pistol, shot gun. It's that easy
[4:46:56] <+katarjin> # banshee at once was fun
[4:46:59] <peachy996> How I despise thee
[4:46:59] <+katarjin> 3*
[4:47:01] <dawarw0lf> Pat is being dumb but it’s definitely others to blame
[4:47:10] <Mattais88> I don't think I ever got IK'ed by a Banshee.
[4:47:15] <DatAsuna> if you go back to MP, remember synch kills don't work on inclines lol
[4:47:20] <DatAsuna> Fight them on ramps and you can't be grabbed
[4:47:22] <%joodatious> pat playing dumb is good
[4:47:23] <+athuramn> HypeDerp
[4:47:31] <+AmericanSkidd> Hundreds of us together barely form a toddler in terms of intelligence
[4:47:32] <%joodatious> chat trying to tell pat what to do is annoying as hell
[4:47:35] <%DrTomT18> does anyone notice how much pieges boobs jiggle in this animation
[4:47:39] <%tank7013> I missed most of the stream, are people still blatantly trying to tailor his character to them?
[4:47:41] <+Scevda> @datasuna i did not know that ty
[4:47:45] <peachy996> Pat headbutted Turrets and kept doing so, I have no sympy for him
[4:47:46] <dawarw0lf> He’ll get the venom shotgun see that it is too heavy and toss it but he will still be fine on powers
[4:47:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, but then they just regular melee you to death in like 4 hits
[4:47:55] <%pipboy344> @peachy996 You stay away from them because they can 1-hit melee kill
[4:47:57] <%joodatious> @DrTomT18 Kappa yes
[4:48:07] <%DrTomT18> lel
[4:48:08] <%Dopamien> SourPls no mods SourPls
[4:48:25] <dawarw0lf> This stream makes me appreciate the enemy variety. It was so good. Counters for everything
[4:48:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Geth forming a consensus looks the same as Twitch plays Pokemon
[4:48:44] <%DrTomT18> yeah, Mass Effect 2 was really lacking in enemy verity
[4:48:45] <%joodatious> that krogen spike shotgun will likely change pats mine
[4:48:50] <+athuramn> lime freezies are so good
[4:48:51] <%DrTomT18> just Mercs in different flavors
[4:48:56] <ToneBacas> no signal PogChamp
[4:48:57] <dawarw0lf> Squadmate would help but Pat had always been too strong to need them
[4:48:58] <%Mr_Pylon> You saved Dark Souls
[4:48:59] <%YakumoYomi> Did you?!
[4:49:01] <%Ipsenscastle> why
[4:49:01] <acridpaladin> but at what cost?
[4:49:04] <+Scevda> @dawarw0lf i kind of wish they had added the mercs as well from me2
[4:49:05] <%MidnightBurst12> solved poverty?
[4:49:06] <SilverFaustX> goes to paiges stream
[4:49:07] <%joodatious> tasty flavor mercs
[4:49:08] <%barrakuta371> You're such a hero
[4:49:11] <DianaTheAscian> He did it chat
[4:49:14] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[4:49:18] <Mattais88> I hated Venom Shotgun
[4:49:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you remember to upgrade her estus off camera?
[4:49:21] <DatAsuna> I dipped into andromeda MP recently and disagree with people saying it lacked enemy variety. The problem with andromeda MP was the classes were built to need other players to do their combos
[4:49:25] <%Mr_Pylon> Offline on Steam, tis a tragedy
[4:49:25] <%MidnightBurst12> a tragedy
[4:49:29] <dawarw0lf> @scevda My biggest complaint is not enough Geth in the story
[4:49:31] <stantheman_97> but can you save this stream?
[4:49:34] <+kullumanati> Charity work
[4:49:36] <%Ranryu692> There's a lot of Citadel stuff fyi
[4:49:36] <peachy996> yay
[4:49:37] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA
[4:49:38] <%TheYellowcouch> yayy
[4:49:39] <%joodatious> chat doesn't deserve it pat

[4:49:46] <%YakumoYomi> I wasn't
[4:49:46] <+AmericanSkidd> ok very cool
[4:49:46] <DatAsuna> So you can't solo andromeda as handily as me3
[4:49:48] <%joodatious> just end the stream to punish them
[4:49:51] <%shurtal> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:49:52] <%gliph13> im okay wit dat
[4:49:54] <Mattais88> Really, I thought we'd end right now. This is all good
[4:49:56] <+tinytinykittycat> cool
[4:49:56] <dawarw0lf> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[4:49:58] <%MidnightBurst12> i like being talked to like a child :)

[4:50:02] <OldManDeckardCain> pat pulling a Sony move right thee LUL

[4:50:16] <DatAsuna> it does
[4:50:18] <%sunsetdisc0> fuck I'm late
[4:50:18] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat did you know Grissom is on a limit?
[4:50:19] <+kullumanati> Off stream spite
[4:50:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the reason everyone says Grissom Academy is that BAD things happen if you wait too long
[4:50:19] <%TheYellowcouch> yes
[4:50:23] <$realm_forge> Pat would make a scary patent
[4:50:23] <%joodatious> burds
[4:50:25] <DianaTheAscian> what do people mean by its timed anyway?
[4:50:28] <%DrTomT18> they always looked more like cats to me
[4:50:28] <$realm_forge> Parent
[4:50:30] <GustauveVIII> grissom just felt like a normal sidequest to me since jack never endeared herself at all at any point in ME2
[4:50:30] <dawarw0lf> @galacticaphanto It comes later after citadel 2
[4:50:31] <%barrakuta371> Bird up
[4:50:36] <RedPlasticCup> Cortez has dialogue after all the MP missions iirc
[4:50:36] <%TheYellowcouch> Roboobs
[4:50:38] <heartlesshealer> caw
[4:50:42] <DianaTheAscian> birds are birds
[4:50:45] <+MrATheGreat> Also caling Turians "the birds" seems like something Ashley would say
[4:50:46] <%Ipsenscastle> birds are just reptiles though
[4:50:46] <+AmericanSkidd> Damn Twitch chat, they RUINED TWITCH CHAT
[4:50:48] <Profmcstevie> STaring at whut
[4:50:48] <+Scevda> Birb
[4:50:51] <%MidnightBurst12> solid metal orbs
[4:50:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> @dawarw0lf Aww man I was hoping he'd see the good stuff today
[4:50:58] <peachy996> Good now you know
[4:51:08] <heartlesshealer> reptiles are just land birds
[4:51:10] <%bread_assassin> Never do Grissom Academy out of spite, now.
[4:51:11] <%Ranryu692> Yes
[4:51:13] <%snugglepuggs> richkidMentor richkidMentor richkidMentor
[4:51:15] <TioXyco> yes
[4:51:15] <%Dopamien> ?? its a lack of mods. People would hesitate to talk shit when they can get shot
[4:51:16] <%miguelrod777> you just made an enemy for life
[4:51:16] <%TheYellowcouch> Do you think Miranda would be upset if she found out Liara took her office
[4:51:16] <%unstablebeast19> only girl you can never sleep with,  is the sex bot
[4:51:17] <%tank7013> Cerberus needs to get David back to harness that magic autism
[4:51:24] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> "But let me keep telling you the things that you already told us you know about"
[4:51:24] <Mattais88> I mean, shouldn't we want bad things to happen to laugh at? That's every Dark Souls stream
[4:51:24] <peachy996> And yet chat will continue to remind you cuz fuck you lol
[4:51:26] <+Scevda> @bread_assassin lol
[4:51:28] <%joodatious> i dont think there is new stuff on the ship
[4:51:32] <dawarw0lf> @galacticaphanto Yeah there two sections of the citadel and javik is in the second half
[4:51:40] <Profmcstevie> Prothean notes: fucking 4 eyes
[4:51:43] <%joodatious> nah only story missions i think
[4:51:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @tank7013 oh god I just remember that
[4:51:47] <+tinytinykittycat> G Bird

[4:51:53] <FlyguyJP> Later
[4:51:54] <dawarw0lf> LATER
[4:52:04] <DatAsuna> @Mattais88 bad things with real consequences, not bad things with "this generic enemy has their nameplate changed"
[4:52:08] <PaperyHornet1013> He’s so cool
[4:52:10] <dawarw0lf> why he got a be so defensive of talking garrus
[4:52:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's super funny how mad Liara is that Javik isn't even close to what she had thought
[4:52:37] <%jillyrancher> Cortez should have new dialogue
[4:52:44] <%joodatious> @Mattais88 what is a "real consequence" that sounds incredibly subjective
[4:52:46] <%Dopamien> People can't backseat if they can't type in chat 5head

[4:54:55] <%joodatious> her outfit is awful
[4:54:57] <dawarw0lf> @joodatious It’s good idea to just pretend it doesn’t exist
[4:55:02] <%DrTomT18> "Yes, I totally blew up that Mass Relay to stop the Reapers... not to kill thousands of Baterians."
[4:55:05] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Patmake sure to buy the wine from the kiosk at the hospital before you talk to Kaiden

[4:55:48] <%DrTomT18> not every planet was hit at once.
[4:55:52] <+Scevda> Im teen pregnant
[4:55:53] <+DarkJaguar124> Miranda should've been a squadmate
[4:55:54] <xcompleasedad> Suprisingly, yes.
[4:55:56] <%subparSamaritan> Miranda there's kind of more important things going on right now
[4:55:58] <%joodatious> @Vantesla thats why they should stop trying to help
[4:56:00] <Mattais88> I wonder if Miranda learned how to cry in the last few months
[4:56:01] <+AmericanSkidd> probably nothing
[4:56:02] <peachy996> remember asari aren't getting hit
[4:56:05] <PaperyHornet1013> Kiss her pat
[4:56:09] <TioXyco> @peachy996 yet
[4:56:13] <Marakami_Sadaneo> why is she constantly smiling
[4:56:25] <%DrTomT18> nah, I think Jack, Kasumi, or Zieed should have been a squad mate in this game
[4:56:37] <%DrTomT18> Thane has an excuse.
[4:56:41] <%greasypete00> yennifer?
[4:56:51] <Vantesla> @joodatious Sometimes many don't realize they being derp so ya gotta be direct LUL
[4:57:01] <%joodatious> @DrTomT18 in fairness jack has good reason to be away
[4:57:02] <xcompleasedad> @DrTomT18 Totally. But, the amount of writing and coding would have been INSANE for this game.
[4:57:07] <blackjack8182> She has no reason not to join your crew
[4:57:07] <%joodatious> and since the others are dlc EHHH
[4:57:09] <%joodatious> might be weird
[4:57:12] <%bread_assassin> @DrTomT18 Well good news, they are..........in the DLC arena.
[4:57:21] <%DrTomT18> yeah
[4:57:26] <%subparSamaritan> lmao
[4:57:28] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[4:57:30] <arkv01> no
[4:57:30] <%JamesCorck> Hi, sorry, I stepped down for a moment to watch "The Wire", have we done Grissom Academy yet or have I missed it?
[4:57:31] <slix3431> HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DUMPER?
[4:57:36] <arkv01> the fat ass needs air
[4:57:39] <Aiutare47> or just wear clothes, you can do that now, its not a uniform anymore
[4:57:41] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt If you romanced Miranda in ME2 and broke up with her in ME3, negative outcomes happen.
[4:57:41] <%DrTomT18> anyone who sees Mirandas ass knows its her
[4:57:41] <%subparSamaritan> The picture on her ID is just her ass
[4:57:41] <+rageoftheporo> the wanted poster is just a pic of her ass
[4:57:46] <Vantesla> A change of clothes and not just taking the patch off at least LUL
[4:57:46] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is this like the time Dick Grayson got found out while undercover because a villain recognized his ass
[4:57:47] <%Ranryu692> but Pat, that would take time to make a new asset. and there was no time
[4:57:48] <+alphonseisbest> @JamesCorck hahahahahahahaha
[4:57:49] <%RedSqurrl> ass sensors
[4:57:49] <robosqueeb> teenage me simpletoned for mirandas hexagon honker badonkers
[4:57:51] <+MrATheGreat> That ass would''ve been seen a galaxy away anyway
[4:57:57] <%joodatious> @DrTomT18 exactly the game was already super rushed
[4:57:58] <+AmericanSkidd> "damn gurl, you shit with dat ass"
[4:57:58] <$realm_forge> IM OFF TA SHOOT SPACE  DINGOS GOODAY SHEP!
[4:57:59] <%YakumoYomi> A coat wouldn't help. The clap of those cheeks alerts everyone within a 2km radius
[4:58:00] <%Monkeyweed21> the clap of her cheeks acts as a form of sonar to keep her safe
[4:58:02] <%idyota> jesus christ
[4:58:02] <LordDudeTheFirst> Wow
[4:58:05] <+akscully> omg
[4:58:06] <%JamesCorck> @JamesCorck XD I'll take that as a no <3

[4:58:11] <ToneBacas> oh noooo
[4:58:13] <%Ranryu692> but then you wouldn't have needed a rubber
[4:58:14] <%subparSamaritan> Christ almighty
[4:58:16] <xcompleasedad> @joodatious They still should have had more squad members if the game was more "realistic." Programming wise, it was a VERY good decision to cut where they did.
[4:58:18] <%barrakuta371> psaWhat
[4:58:18] <%Jmann1892> LUL
[4:58:18] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL
[4:58:19] <%DrTomT18> what he is laughing at?
[4:58:19] <$lotharrio> Pat, you and sick girl have non compatible DNA. That's the MOST barren field. Your crops would kill her.
[4:58:21] <Marakami_Sadaneo> wtf Pat LUL
[4:58:22] <viewtifulr> Im off to poison a swamp
[4:58:22] <%joodatious> in hindsight this game is amazing knowing all the problems it had
[4:58:24] <xcompleasedad> YOU CAN'T HAVE BABIES WITH TALI
[4:58:24] <%shurtal> holy fuck that's bad
[4:58:24] <+Peacefrog7> barren field huh?

[4:59:04] <%DrTomT18> you did it!

[4:59:30] <+condemned_15> pawnch

[4:59:35] <heartlesshealer> Thane ; ;
[4:59:36] <peachy996> Big busy signal
[4:59:37] <%DrTomT18> Thane is such a bro. He just wanted to send you funny memes over the externet
[4:59:40] <%subparSamaritan> Oh god, I just remembered how all the side quests in this game are just Shepard eavesdropping on people
[4:59:46] <FlyguyJP> Thane with the Space Lung Cancer
[4:59:46] <+MrATheGreat> So basically Space Cancer
[4:59:49] <peachy996> "we're sorry, your call is unavaliable"
[4:59:50] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[4:59:50] <$lotharrio> @Vantesla Worse. Because Pat-Shep and sick-girl KNOW that he's doing to her body, and they're both just going all in on it.
[4:59:52] <+MrATheGreat> Who's Kaiden?
[4:59:53] <tuesti> Visiting a friend. NOT YOU.
[4:59:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Space AIDS?
[4:59:54] <+condemned_15> LUL
[4:59:55] <+TrevSmith222> So he basically has COPD.
[4:59:55] <ToneBacas> Kaiden who? LUL
[4:59:57] <%DrTomT18> "Oh yeah, Kaiden. Sure."
[4:59:57] <blackjack8182> Such a bro
[4:59:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> Did...Didn't you ASK me to come here?
[4:59:58] <+MrATheGreat> You mean muscle tits?
[5:00:00] <+condemned_15> monkaS
[5:00:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why is Thane dressed like a space prostitute?
[5:00:07] <+CyanDeadEye> Reminder: Thane was at <50% due to his disease during the suicide mission.
[5:00:09] <+tinytinykittycat> siha
[5:00:10] <tattleworm> shh
[5:00:10] <DatAsuna> Thane best bro
[5:00:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> Thane is such a bro
[5:00:11] <%QueequegTheater> Shhh that's not canon
[5:00:14] <Aiutare47> @rumtumtugnutz "Lore"
[5:00:14] <+AmericanSkidd> did he?
[5:00:15] <peachy996> nah you didn't
[5:00:18] <Mattais88> Nah, thnae was after horizon
[5:00:19] <arkv01> no, not in this timeline :)
[5:00:20] <%TheYellowcouch> Thane is so cool
[5:00:20] <%QueequegTheater> Siha :(
[5:00:21] <%DrTomT18> what? no he wasnt. Thane doesn't join you until the second act
[5:00:22] <%bread_assassin> no, he wasn't.

[5:00:28] <heartlesshealer> Pat he has a different view on memories
[5:00:32] <FlyguyJP> Thane has a bit of the Alzheimer's
[5:00:36] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[5:00:39] <peachy996> well done
[5:00:47] <$lotharrio> I think you can only get Thane after Kaiden yells at you.
[5:00:49] <%DrTomT18> "our cook quit!"
[5:00:50] <DatAsuna> He does have dialogue for missions before horizon but he's silent on horizon iirc
[5:00:50] <+bassforte123> @rumtumtugnutz Doctors say he has to keep his chest exposed to reduce lung moisture build up, yes really
[5:00:51] <%Ranryu692> if FemShep romances Thane, you can fuck now, and if you ask to go again, he's like "bitch I'm dying, I can't"
[5:00:51] <+akscully> still got your coffee cup in life support
[5:00:52] <%gliph13> WHAT DA FUDGE IS CANON IN THIS GAME?!
[5:00:53] <dawarw0lf> Don’t look at Shepard’s hands
[5:00:57] <Profmcstevie> Just write down neck breaking strats
[5:00:57] <SilverFaustX> he looks like a east euro guy with a tracksuit on
[5:01:08] <+flexin_apex> Thane can be the new cook
[5:01:08] <%QueequegTheater> LOOK AT SHEPARD'S HANDS
[5:01:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> The reaper invasion in LITERALLY THE WORST time to take a breaking from war
[5:01:14] <%joodatious> Thane be like: please dude i'm literally dying in pain leave me alone
[5:01:15] <dawarw0lf> The HANDS ARE AFWUL. Why didn’t they fix them
[5:01:21] <%DrTomT18> @Profmcstevie In Lair of the Shadow Broker he has a list of best ways to kill aliens
[5:01:21] <%Ranryu692> that 3 month time frame lines up with the Suicide MIssion LUL
[5:01:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Yikes, getting flashbacks of my grandmother

[5:01:47] <xcompleasedad> Why are they floating?

[5:01:54] <+MrATheGreat> OH FUYCK HE HAS COVID :O
[5:01:54] <%Ranryu692> did he learn what hemoglobin was just so he could explain this to you?
[5:01:56] <arkv01> maybe we can inject him with oxygen???
[5:01:57] <%DrTomT18> I love you weird frog man
[5:02:02] <$lotharrio> Thane has holes in his brain and too much sugar in his blood.
[5:02:03] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> T_T
[5:02:04] <%gliph13> "So your saying im baicily Immortal"?
[5:02:08] <blackjack8182> Even the slightest breeze could kill him
[5:02:08] <%RLT917> atpFeelsBeardMan
[5:02:09] <MarylandJutsu> @arkv01 not how it works
[5:02:11] <TioXyco> Thane's sickness hit differently now to me

[5:02:18] <Vantesla> At least he can literally negate all pain with delving into vivid good memories
[5:02:19] <%DrTomT18> this is pointless
[5:02:21] <FlyguyJP> Skype with Thane
[5:02:25] <+MrATheGreat> Thane is the COOLEST
[5:02:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "hope it's not catching, bye!"
[5:02:28] <+AmericanSkidd> oh this is dumb
[5:02:31] <%subparSamaritan> Shepard stop eavesdropping on everyone
[5:02:31] <heartlesshealer> we love you thane
[5:02:34] <%joodatious> Zoom with thane
[5:02:37] <+denizen_conspirator> Is that a character that wasn't initially in 3 and they got him back in because of backlash?
[5:02:37] <arkv01> thanks I do standup on sundays too
[5:02:38] <FlyguyJP> This is an actually good arguement
[5:02:39] <MarylandJutsu> oh lord

[5:02:58] <heartlesshealer> uhhhh
[5:03:02] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt If Thane's loyalty mission is failed but he still lives, aside from a few dialogue rewrites, his story in ME3 does not change. At all.

[5:03:17] <Lancaster_H> "but you didn't do anything"

[5:06:18] <+DarkJaguar124> You can crack something else open...
[5:06:20] <+RJay80> someone probably rocked him while he was sleeping
[5:06:20] <%snugglepuggs> You’re looking in a mirror pat. Shepard doesn’t look any better
[5:06:21] <dawarw0lf> LOOK AT HIS NIPS
[5:06:23] <SaltyAzteca> reminds me of that
[5:06:30] <%unstablebeast19> Cheer500 hope you've been enjoying me3 so far oat, also question, is Dr Michelle's French accent better in this than in 1? as a dumb American I can't tell which is more accurate

[5:06:57] <%QueequegTheater> I'd rather be gay with you
[5:07:00] <%joodatious> if this is Ashley its SO bad
[5:07:00] <%DrTomT18> @arkv01 All the men in ME3 are massive
[5:07:01] <GuilKato> Kaidan wants the D

[5:07:06] <Aiutare47> Kaiden is N7 isnt he?
[5:07:06] <GuilKato> the Shepard D
[5:07:07] <MarylandJutsu> you're not racist
[5:07:09] <MarylandJutsu> so i mean
[5:07:10] <tanarath> It's attached to a lot of things, like his central nervous system & his brain.
[5:07:11] <+StrikeTheErf> Kaiden is a current-gen model with ps2 era hair
[5:07:13] <arkv01> sure kaidan I can stick my pp in your pooper once you're better
[5:07:13] <%unstablebeast19> man pat, imagine if you kept Ashley alive, you'd get to see her this beat up, and a better character

[5:07:39] <studleydoorite> why is there blood coming out of his nose and mouth LUL insurance wouldn't cover it?
[5:07:40] <%QueequegTheater> Kaidan is bi

[5:07:56] <+CyanDeadEye> @kewlmyc yes
[5:07:59] <%DrTomT18> @kewlmyc Yes. Her story is almost exact the same
[5:08:02] <FlyguyJP> Gotta be 'that guy' and say Ashley was not that bad. She talks about her changes in ME3.
[5:08:07] <+AmericanSkidd> he loves it
[5:08:10] <dawarw0lf> I appreciate the apology
[5:08:12] <+alphonseisbest> he's trying his best
[5:08:17] <arkv01> he's communicating with aliens on a higher plane
[5:08:18] <%gliph13> God, i wish you could bring EDI to see him
[5:08:19] <%DrTomT18> HAHA

[5:08:25] <PaperyHornet1013> Dump tali for kaiden to prove it
[5:08:25] <%joodatious> she also does not change
[5:08:26] <+akscully> lmao
[5:08:26] <%Ipsenscastle> hahaha
[5:08:27] <%Gorshum> LUL
[5:08:27] <+rageoftheporo> lmaoooo
[5:08:28] <%subparSamaritan> Ashley's a fucking hole on Virmire
[5:08:29] <Sp3ctre48> This is true
[5:08:29] <%EthorXL> She did die, I seen it
[5:08:29] <%QueequegTheater> She was still 100% right
[5:08:29] <%he1lhydra> psaDab
[5:08:29] <FlyguyJP> God dammit
[5:08:30] <Marakami_Sadaneo> different timeline LUL
[5:08:30] <+Mr___Pillow> PogChamp
[5:08:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ashley's not *that* bad because she gets better
[5:08:31] <+AmericanSkidd> she died a space racist
[5:08:32] <+Zyquux> Ash will forever be better than Kaiden "wet carboard" Alenko
[5:08:32] <%JamesCorck> Ashley turns into an alcoholic in ME3.
[5:08:33] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:33] <Profmcstevie> Odd, a talking dead person
[5:08:34] <studleydoorite> I don't know if I've ever seen a man with that bald pattern jogging
[5:08:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> what changes? she died in the first game
[5:08:35] <xcompleasedad> Can't speak if you DED LUL
[5:08:35] <arkv01> oh y-yeah she is
[5:08:39] <arkv01> of course silly yus
[5:08:39] <%joodatious> Ashley tries to kill you cus she's a fucking moron
[5:08:41] <@commanderclaw> She talks about how someone turned the bimbofication ray on her
[5:08:41] <dawarw0lf> She can’t talk
[5:08:43] <tattleworm> she got hit by the bimbofication laser
[5:08:46] <robosqueeb> ash being xenophobic matters in one because she evolves out of it over time if she lives, its supposed to be character progression
[5:08:49] <dawarw0lf> She’s “ash”
[5:08:49] <+D00msDayDan> guy must be playing a different game
[5:08:51] <DatAsuna> Ashley remains an aggro bitch in ME3
[5:08:53] <+alphonseisbest> ME1 Ashley was right tho
[5:08:53] <robosqueeb> but her class sucks and shes boring af
[5:08:56] <%lumporr> she's like... atomized
[5:08:56] <%FacetiousAF> @commanderclaw oh no. what a tragedy
[5:08:56] <PaperyHornet1013> Ashley was 100% right tho
[5:08:57] <%hatok> people act like she has some big redemption arc in ME3 but she totally doesnt' she just stops mentioning racist stuff so much
[5:08:57] <%JamesCorck> If you keep her alive, you find her drunk off her ass on the Normandy at one point, and it's pathetic, and hilarious.
[5:08:58] <$realm_forge> She died as she lived....a horrible racist
[5:09:00] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:09:02] <$lotharrio> I'm tired of all these fanfic writers with their "what if Kaiden died, instead" stories.
[5:09:03] <%DrTomT18> HM I WONDER IF THIS IS A SIDE QUEST?
[5:09:06] <DatAsuna> THat said, dumping her in 3 is funny
[5:09:06] <Mattais88> It's just a charred skkeleton in the bed
[5:09:07] <blackjack8182> Ashley was right tho
[5:09:15] <@commanderclaw> @commanderclaw "Oh no, whatever shall we do" :I
[5:09:17] <dawarw0lf> DONT LOOK AT HIS HANDS
[5:09:22] <FlyguyJP> #AshleyWasRight
[5:09:25] <%DrTomT18> @blackjack8182 She was right for the wrong reasons
[5:09:30] <%subparSamaritan> HALF THE GALAXY IS MIA SHEPARD
[5:09:37] <%Ipsenscastle> wow the echo here is ridiculous
[5:09:37] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt parents don't care
[5:09:43] <+StrikeTheErf> y'all complaining about ashley's model when this shepard is staring you in the face
[5:09:48] <$lotharrio> THey ate him.
[5:09:48] <+Mr___Pillow> hand x axis off kilter sir?
[5:09:49] <arkv01> bro hes dead
[5:09:52] <%joodatious> hmm
[5:09:53] <peachy996> Read the room then
[5:09:54] <%gliph13> dude, theres like milions dying every hour.
[5:09:55] <%QueequegTheater> Big room
[5:09:56] <leinadtonu> what is bureaucratic compassion even?
[5:09:57] <%JamesCorck> Ashley's only honorable thing she did was to blow up with the Nuke on Virmire, and if you keep her alive she just carries the stigma of her family for surrendering during the First Contact War.
[5:09:58] <dawarw0lf> So is this guy like the human president or something
[5:09:58] <%DrTomT18> there aren't a lot of people in this room. yet.
[5:09:59] <Sp3ctre48> Dramatic effect
[5:10:01] <TioXyco> wanna know something funny? "Bilal" is a name we brazilian call our dicks
[5:10:02] <Aiutare47> it is a huge room
[5:10:03] <%joodatious> it has bad acoustics
[5:10:05] <%Ranryu692> it's a big room
[5:10:05] <TheBadoe> because it's a bathroom
[5:10:07] <Heyestus> because this game was shat out in 18 months
[5:10:07] <+AmericanSkidd> its a pretty big room
[5:10:08] <+tinytinykittycat> its a big room
[5:10:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> The dude is super dead. Like if his squad is avoiding you then he's dead.
[5:10:20] <studleydoorite> don't worry, if I find him I'll make sure he's dead
[5:10:21] <+Zyquux> Because they never installed the streamer padding
[5:10:22] <%DrTomT18> free stuff!
[5:10:27] <Marakami_Sadaneo> more like DiploPat
[5:10:30] <peachy996> Ah that's why I remember Bay D24
[5:10:31] <+StrikeTheErf> yeah it echos because a lobby like this would echo a bit
[5:10:34] <%lumporr> i like how people say "no it's ok that she distrusts aliens bc they attacked us!" as if distrusting a *number* of races for individual actions *isn't* racist
[5:10:34] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[5:10:35] <%DrTomT18> Shepard: "I wonder what that means."
[5:10:40] <FlyguyJP> HOW CONVENIENT
[5:10:41] <peachy996> Everything is waiting on Bay D24 lol
[5:10:42] <+D00msDayDan> guy on the bench is having none of it
[5:10:44] <+AmericanSkidd> ah yes the secret project
[5:10:45] <%subparSamaritan> Hell yeah Volus
[5:10:46] <%DrTomT18> I love Volus
[5:10:50] <%DrTomT18> They are so shit
[5:10:52] <+denizen_conspirator> there
[5:10:55] <hat_under_bread> I read that as Earth-chan for a moment.
[5:10:58] <+denizen_conspirator> 's a bunch of pats here
[5:10:59] <%joodatious> the real tragedy about no MP is pat wont be able to try out the Volus which he would love
[5:11:02] <DatAsuna> the secret project we just openly discuss in public
[5:11:02] <robosqueeb> this story :(
[5:11:05] <+akscully> oh no
[5:11:06] <Maids4lyfe> we need the Biotic God to help us
[5:11:06] <%joodatious> their run is so goofy
[5:11:06] <%subparSamaritan> I'm still salty we didn't get a Volus squad member
[5:11:11] <$lotharrio> Oops she has the bad brain
[5:11:12] <%DrTomT18> oh no
[5:11:14] <%QueequegTheater> @lumporr She explicitly doesn't hate individuals, she distrusts their governments
[5:11:14] <arkv01> this is depressing :(
[5:11:16] <%joodatious> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:11:16] <FlyguyJP> The Volus are unabashedly amoral bastards
[5:11:18] <+Zyquux> The best Volus line is "Are you *inhale* mocking me?!"
[5:11:19] <%Rumbutt> that's real rough
[5:11:20] <%gliph13> Deppresing
[5:11:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> My Grandmother in Law is doing this is recently and that always is rough to see
[5:11:25] <Profmcstevie> Too close to the future
[5:11:26] <DianaTheAscian> fuck
[5:11:27] <DatAsuna> you don't wanna deal with sadder chakwas?
[5:11:30] <FlyguyJP> Oh no Grandma has the Alzheimer's
[5:11:32] <%joodatious> @FlyguyJP thats racist
[5:11:33] <%DrTomT18> @FlyguyJP unless the galaxy is burning, then they turn into bros
[5:11:36] <%Zrams3y> oh hey the doc from new vegas!
[5:11:45] <+AmericanSkidd> it never pours, it floods
[5:11:50] <ScreamLord> "Not gettin' on THIS feel trip!"
[5:11:50] <%DrTomT18> oh shit,you're right dude

[5:15:13] <+akscully> yes on partner
[5:15:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> How can spectres pardon people for alliances charger?
[5:15:17] <%Ranryu692> authorize everything
[5:15:17] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[5:15:18] <+akscully> NOT HUNTRESS
[5:15:18] <peachy996> That's neat you can have the engineers from ME1 and ME2 in one room for ME3
[5:15:19] <DatAsuna> not all
[5:15:19] <Alzero83> Sentence them to DIE
[5:15:19] <%DrTomT18> NOOO
[5:15:20] <tattleworm> everything but asari huntress
[5:15:21] <PaperyHornet1013> Don’t save them
[5:15:21] <%miguelrod777> not all
[5:15:21] <+tinytinykittycat> war number go up
[5:15:22] <GustauveVIII> NO PERMITS
[5:15:25] <%subparSamaritan> You get a pardon, and you get a pardon, and youuu get a pardon
[5:15:28] <FlyguyJP> He can do that?!
[5:15:28] <GustauveVIII> NOT PERMITS
[5:15:28] <+Zyquux> I forget which ones are the bad ones
[5:15:29] <arkv01> everyone goes free, its like prisonbreak but legal!
[5:15:31] <%hatok> most spectre stuff is good but some hurts your war assets
[5:15:36] <%DrTomT18> No permits for the Huntress
[5:15:36] <+akscully> huntress was the ptsd asari
[5:15:36] <%Ranryu692> SAVE
[5:15:37] <+OneGorillionDollars> trust me bro authorize the gun in the hospital Kappa
[5:15:44] <+Alig200> changed a war asset
[5:15:44] <DatAsuna> Or, you could save, give her the gun then keep it or reload idk
[5:15:49] <GustauveVIII> PERMITS BAD
[5:15:53] <%miguelrod777> war asset went down
[5:15:55] <dawarw0lf> Save this mission is very bugged
[5:15:56] <%DrTomT18> also, check the shop when you get a second, it has stuff you missed
[5:16:02] <DSD24> Pat needs a cooler Helmet
[5:16:04] <RedPlasticCup> test your wepon
[5:16:13] <%QueequegTheater> Use the beam gun
[5:16:14] <%StoopKid241> StoopKid241 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:16:19] <%jillyrancher> Oh no Pat did you authorize the weapon permit
[5:16:20] <DatAsuna> if you wanna piss people off, just use an smg lol
[5:16:22] <peachy996> Particle Rifle is pretty strong
[5:16:28] <tattleworm> if you can afford it, the piranha from the spectre terminal was my fave vanguard weapon. heavy as hell though.
[5:16:31] <+Alig200> the longer you fire it, the more powerufl it gets
[5:16:33] <peachy996> IT melts defenses
[5:16:35] <dawarw0lf> I’d by a dlc weapon on the citadel. One of the cheap ones
[5:16:37] <+Zyquux> does the piercing mod do anything on the particle rifle?
[5:16:38] <%QueequegTheater> YEP
[5:16:39] <%DrTomT18> yes
[5:16:40] <DatAsuna> and with AP it will go through walls
[5:16:41] <peachy996> But the recharge time is there
[5:16:41] <%Ranryu692> yup
[5:16:42] <+MrATheGreat> It's a solver but dat reload tho
[5:16:46] <arkv01> that exhaust is rad too
[5:16:49] <tanarath> Literally yes
[5:16:49] <DatAsuna> and through shields
[5:16:51] <$realm_forge> BRRRRRRRRRRR
[5:16:53] <SaltyAzteca> MOONSCRAPER
[5:16:54] <%DrTomT18> too bad there is no money cheat
[5:16:55] <+OneGorillionDollars> Its a heavy gun tho
[5:16:57] <%subparSamaritan> I appreciate that Javik's gun is basically just the Collector particle rifle from ME2. Makes sense the Reaper's would use the Prothean's tech
[5:16:57] <dawarw0lf> Yep
[5:16:58] <%unstablebeast19> wait until you are able to buy some of the guns down in the presidium, there are some quarian weapons that fucking rule
[5:16:59] <%DrTomT18> this game needs it
[5:17:02] <+D00msDayDan> wouldn't have been surprised if prothean weapons were somehow ALSO using goddamn thermal clips
[5:17:04] <peachy996> Weapons get better and more fun as the game goes on
[5:17:09] <Profmcstevie> Maybe that's why protheans lost, they were all on cooldown
[5:17:16] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Check the Spectre shop for missed items.
[5:17:30] <%DrTomT18> including quest items
[5:17:31] <+Zyquux> LUL
[5:17:35] <+Alig200> missed items or very expensive dlc weaponry lol
[5:17:41] <Aiutare47> no
[5:17:44] <+AmericanSkidd> oh baby
[5:17:45] <Aiutare47> these are DLC weapons
[5:17:47] <%DrTomT18> No, these are DLC weapons
[5:17:47] <GustauveVIII> missed nothing gj
[5:17:48] <+StrikeTheErf> harrier is juiced
[5:17:49] <DatAsuna> the harrier fucks
[5:17:50] <GustauveVIII> GET THE TYPHOON
[5:17:50] <+unhuggable1> harrier so good
[5:17:51] <%Ranryu692> the Harrier is great
[5:17:52] <@commanderclaw> These are DLC weapons IIRC
[5:17:52] <peachy996> No these are guns you can just buy
[5:17:54] <%DrTomT18> good job Pat
[5:17:55] <RedPlasticCup> DLC weapons
[5:17:55] <robosqueeb> any side missino quest items you miss end up here
[5:17:55] <%gliph13> missed nothing
[5:17:56] <$lotharrio> Black Widow is always a Spectre weapon
[5:17:56] <+akscully> no, it's only available in store
[5:17:56] <Mattais88> These are all dlc pack weapons
[5:17:57] <peachy996> And they all rcok
[5:17:58] <%idyota> TYPHOON
[5:17:59] <Aiutare47> some of these are stupid good guns
[5:17:59] <%Jmann1892> Harrier is sooo good
[5:18:01] <blackjack8182> Buy Harriee
[5:18:04] <%tank7013> Is the phaeston in this one? I remember loving it in the multiplayer
[5:18:04] <peachy996> THERE'S THE TYPHOON
[5:18:04] <%subparSamaritan> All games should have a "missed items" shop, saves people with OCD
[5:18:04] <DatAsuna> paladin and widow .etc are big slow shots
[5:18:05] <dawarw0lf> Wraith is good
[5:18:05] <GustauveVIII> TYPHOON
[5:18:07] <tattleworm> typhoon on garrus is stupid good
[5:18:08] <blackjack8182> Harrier
[5:18:08] <Alzero83> Paladin is strong AF
[5:18:09] <+AmericanSkidd> this is the GOOD SHIT
[5:18:14] <Aiutare47> typhoon is legit broken on squadmates
[5:18:16] <%Taisuru> TYPHOON
[5:18:17] <%snugglepuggs> REALLY GOOD DLC GUNS
[5:18:17] <DatAsuna> piranha is a decent auto shotty
[5:18:17] <dawarw0lf> It’s a double barrel shotgun
[5:18:17] <%DrTomT18> Typhoon on Garrus turns him into a god
[5:18:18] <GustauveVIII> IF YOU GIVE THE TYPHOON TO GARRUS HE'LL MELT EVERYTHING
[5:18:18] <PaperyHornet1013> Your a pro gamer pat
[5:18:18] <%Monkeyweed21> DLC and N7 stuff
[5:18:18] <$realm_forge> If you do they’ll show up there
[5:18:21] <peachy996> Maybe
[5:18:24] <+StrikeTheErf> harrier will carry you all the way
[5:18:26] <%gliph13> if you missed something, it would be DRAMATICLY cheaper then the rest of the stuff
[5:18:28] <@commanderclaw> The typhoon on Garrus turns him into a god of death
[5:18:29] <%unstablebeast19> pat don't cheat
[5:18:30] <%Monkeyweed21> yea sure
[5:18:32] <+condemned_15> Kappa
[5:18:32] <DatAsuna> Paladin is strong, but there's other high damage pistols I prefer
[5:18:34] <%snugglepuggs> CHEAT
[5:18:36] <+AmericanSkidd> you mean check your old galactic bank account?
[5:18:39] <$realm_forge> The harrier is dope
[5:18:40] <+Zyquux> Isn't Typhoon busted on teammates since they don't need to reload?
[5:18:43] <%unstablebeast19> no cheat
[5:18:45] <+katarjin> meh...Black Widow is better
[5:18:47] <dawarw0lf> I love the gold shotgun so much
[5:18:49] <peachy996> Lemme put it this way: The Typhoon solves problems on the Insanity Final Mission
[5:18:49] <xcompleasedad> Which is the grenade pistol?
[5:18:50] <tanarath> @unstablebeast19 pat always cheats
[5:18:53] <peachy996> That's how good the gun is
[5:18:53] <+nickmcjink> !uptime
[5:18:54] <@Moobot> @nickmcjink I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 19m.
[5:18:59] <zhenthrim213> cheaters always prsper
[5:19:00] <%Ranryu692> no it is here
[5:19:02] <dawarw0lf> It’s a space double barrel shotun
[5:19:04] <robosqueeb> no this is still the embassy
[5:19:07] <zhenthrim213> prosper
[5:19:08] <GustauveVIII> Udina has nothing to say
[5:19:09] <+tinytinykittycat> its here
[5:19:12] <%unstablebeast19> black widow is broken because it's the highest damage gun, and has 3 shots before reloading
[5:19:13] <+Alig200> @Zyquux they do need to reload iirc, i cant remember why the typhoon is so busted on them tho
[5:19:13] <DatAsuna> the typhoon is fine, but harrier tho
[5:19:13] <%DrTomT18> the terminal in here, look at map.
[5:19:17] <peachy996> And the N7 Piranha is my Gunfu
[5:19:18] <notsoy> excuse you, that's a SUPER shotgun
[5:19:18] <%Ranryu692> it's near the guy who's looking for his son
[5:19:21] <robosqueeb> uding dong
[5:19:22] <Mattais88> Actually the hanar emabssy is around where that volus was
[5:19:22] <%Monkeyweed21> should you?
[5:19:22] <DatAsuna> also i hate that it's an opaque face shield
[5:19:24] <%subparSamaritan> I forget, is it explained why Udina is suddenly the human Councilor?
[5:19:24] <%DrTomT18> HA
[5:19:25] <DSD24> Nice
[5:19:28] <dawarw0lf> Double check map
[5:19:29] <%gliph13> okay but WHY would you talk to UDINA?!
[5:19:30] <GustauveVIII> Udina will not change his dialogue for the rest of the game
[5:19:30] <%tank7013> More like Poodina
[5:19:33] <+AmericanSkidd> he said the thing
[5:19:37] <peachy996> If I could somehow cuddle the Piranha at night
[5:19:37] <+akscully> terminal is across from you
[5:19:39] <%DrTomT18> 4
[5:19:39] <DSD24> Refuses to Elaborate futher
[5:19:46] <$realm_forge> Take a giant udina on his desk
[5:19:48] <falyden> I should go
[5:19:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> @subparSamaritan Anderson retired to do more Alliance stuff.
[5:19:49] <+akscully> the office suite
[5:19:50] <%gliph13> more like UGH-dina!
[5:19:51] <+MrATheGreat> The window right there, Shepard, Just shove him out like you did that jobber
[5:19:53] <xcompleasedad> @subparSamaritan Anderson left to fight on Earth. Also, ease of story construction
[5:19:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> @subparsamaritan Anderson hated being councilor and stepped down to be front lines
[5:20:00] <+Zyquux> @subparSamaritan I think Anderson steps down or something because he vouches for Shepard in prison
[5:20:07] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[5:20:15] <%unstablebeast19> over to the ledt
[5:20:18] <%unstablebeast19> left
[5:20:32] <%subparSamaritan> As far as hand-waving away player decisions from the first game, that one's at least in character for Anderson
[5:20:35] <dawarw0lf> Blasto 6
[5:20:41] <+MrATheGreat> Horny jellys?
[5:20:42] <%miguelrod777> LUL hangar mistress
[5:20:47] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[5:20:48] <arkv01> yeah that is kinda weird
[5:20:49] <%DrTomT18> hey, it was fun
[5:20:51] <DatAsuna> badum tss
[5:20:51] <+Zyquux> Why is that such an aggressive map updated?
[5:20:55] <DSD24> I hate Kasumi's reasoning here
[5:21:01] <%DrTomT18> Hanar gotta get laid too
[5:21:08] <%DrTomT18> map my man
[5:21:14] <%gliph13> She's wise, that one
[5:21:14] <robosqueeb> maybe the specter terminal again?
[5:21:16] <arkv01> but you'd think jellyfish would just bang whenever and whoever
[5:21:16] <blackjack8182> Coward Kasumi
[5:21:19] <+tinytinykittycat> check map
[5:21:19] <peachy996> Kasumi is oddly not interested in joining you.
[5:21:20] <%DrTomT18> this one is in the shop quarter I think
[5:21:20] <+AmericanSkidd> Tentacles <3
[5:21:24] <DatAsuna> kasumi is just dodging you because no jacob
[5:21:26] <RedPlasticCup> the Terminals you need will show up on the map
[5:21:26] <AngryAsian5> Hanar do got those tentacles tho
[5:21:27] <peachy996> She shoots down the idea immediately
[5:21:31] <dawarw0lf> Wow good quest log!
[5:21:38] <%Ranryu692> it's either specter terminal again, or the holding area
[5:21:40] <robosqueeb> ohh the terminal on the docks
[5:21:41] <%Ipsenscastle> this mission bugged out for me, I had to reload. Not sure if that's happening here though
[5:21:44] <+MrATheGreat> This is that mission in ME2 that you did for liara IIRC
[5:21:45] <%DrTomT18> oh, its in the docking base
[5:21:46] <DatAsuna> I do like that she pre empts it
[5:21:46] <%subparSamaritan> Too bad Shepard doesn't have that copy of Fornax from 2 anymore
[5:21:49] <%DrTomT18> holding area
[5:21:50] <GuilKato> wait kelly chambers is here
[5:21:52] <DatAsuna> Kelly chambers? who?
[5:21:54] <%Ranryu692> Terminal, under security checkpoint
[5:21:54] <%gliph13> Techincly, when you think about it. EVERY mission right now is a suicide mission.
[5:21:57] <+tinytinykittycat> 1
[5:21:57] <+Alig200> its not bugged, the terminal is just in another area.
[5:21:58] <%DrTomT18> Pat no, you didn't do anything wrong
[5:22:01] <$realm_forge> The terminal locations are all over despite what it says
[5:22:06] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt it was there. Docks, Security Checkpoint, Terminal
[5:22:07] <%DrTomT18> Holding area
[5:22:14] <%subparSamaritan> Kelly Chambers... you mean Fish Lady?
[5:22:18] <+tinytinykittycat> it was docks holding area
[5:22:22] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Fair warning Pat, the quest journal in this game is terrible
[5:22:22] <%Ranryu692> you genuinely can't miss it
[5:22:26] <dawarw0lf> THE QUEST LOG SUCKS
[5:22:26] <+Alig200> the Bigadel returns
[5:22:29] <%jillyrancher> like it's so bad
[5:22:30] <+AmericanSkidd> There's gonna be some back and fourth
[5:22:32] <%Ipsenscastle> wrong docks
[5:22:32] <robosqueeb> me2 citadel was such a blueball
[5:22:34] <%DrTomT18> Sorry to back seat, but dont wanna  keep you running around in circils like I did
[5:22:34] <BrOOnoh> the journal sucks dont even bother
[5:22:36] <peachy996> It is a well sized Citadel
[5:22:38] <+MrATheGreat> Wait did pat miss something at that spacxe car?
[5:22:41] <falyden> right? God it's great
[5:22:41] <%Ranryu692> not this dock. Docks: Holding Area. Sorry, should've been clearer
[5:22:41] <peachy996> Not too small not too big
[5:22:43] <DSD24> Keeper!

[5:23:04] <%gliph13> REFUGEE docks
[5:23:05] <%DrTomT18> d2
[5:23:06] <+akscully> holding area

[5:24:22] <+D00msDayDan> Just don’t die idiot
[5:24:22] <+akscully> these choices can affect war assests but they're mostly rp choices, really

[5:27:51] <+MrATheGreat> KELLY CHAMBERS?!
[5:27:54] <DatAsuna> yeah gun blades are only a stat bonus and vanguards/adepts are the worst classes to equip it due to their lowest base stats
[5:27:55] <%subparSamaritan> Feed my fish
[5:27:58] <arkv01> mmmm hello
[5:27:58] <DSD24> Wait her hair looks wrong

[5:28:28] <%JamesCorck> Remember to tell her to change her name n.n
[5:28:28] <DSD24> Hair doesn't look red
[5:28:31] <%Ipsenscastle> Kelly's such a creepazoid. If she was a dude, people would have been waaaay uncomfortable with her character
[5:28:31] <+SmartAssPawn089> She looks even weirder? Oh Bioware.
[5:28:31] <heartlesshealer> Kelly, did you remember to feed the prison fish?
[5:28:34] <Sp3ctre48> Is she plastic now?

[5:41:01] <Mattais88> ME3 is like that
[5:41:02] <%IamGrapes> the weirdest renegade
[5:41:02] <+TrevSmith222> Because hoo ra
[5:41:02] <+galaktic> renegade isn't necessarily BIG ASSHOLE HOURS, its often just macho stuff
[5:41:03] <%tank7013> Because it's... not goody two-shoes enough?
[5:41:05] <%subparSamaritan> RENEGAAAADE
[5:41:05] <dawarw0lf> I don’t get it
[5:41:07] <%StoopKid241> You said DEAD! That's a mean word!

[5:41:15] <Wolfstriker121> how is that a renegade ?!?!
[5:41:15] <%jillyrancher> renegade sometimes just means brash or bold @patstaresat
[5:41:16] <%Broand> Hoorah is renegade
[5:41:16] <%gliph13> Because FUN IS RENEGADE!
[5:41:17] <DSD24> Renegade goes from Warcrime to cool shit a of times
[5:41:17] <thewrathofscience> 300+ RENEGADE
[5:41:18] <+TheBigO75> Being akward is a Paragon trait.
[5:41:18] <+kewlmyc> I guess the Paragon is supposed to a square or some shit?
[5:41:19] <%Treuan> Because being cool is renegade
[5:41:20] <FassieFons> AL GHUL IS EVIL
[5:41:21] <ironoverloaded> Did he just bamboozle you to the darkside for alcohol
[5:41:21] <GuilKato> there was person in bar chairs you missed
[5:41:23] <+cursedwithadhd> cuz paragon Shepard is to goody goody to get that
[5:41:24] <$hattrick61> Renagade=Badass Paragon = Hero
[5:41:27] <%Monkeyweed21> PARAGON IS NARC
[5:41:28] <%joodatious> some renegades in this is like "oh thats cheeky asshole" others is a genocide
[5:41:29] <코코꾸라> 코코꾸라 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Pat, hope you're having fun going through ME3! Do you plan to play NMH3 at the end of the month?
[5:41:31] <%jillyrancher> renegade isnt always douchey
[5:41:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> one hundred percent
[5:41:34] <%subparSamaritan> Yep
[5:41:34] <%DrTomT18> that dude, right there
[5:41:35] <jorniev> I totally forgot pat was playing this
[5:41:35] <peachy996> Turian has a fetchquest you picked up
[5:41:36] <%YakumoYomi> You're a bad man, Pat. I can't believe you did that.
[5:41:37] <%JamesCorck> Oh yeah!
[5:41:38] <+Scevda> Fraternizing between enlisted and officers is a historic taboo
[5:41:38] <%subparSamaritan> It means something completely different every game
[5:41:39] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> they sure have
[5:41:39] <%somekindofsam> yep
[5:41:41] <tanarath> Yep
[5:41:43] <%gliph13> They really have tho
[5:41:44] <%joodatious> until sometimes were its killing your friends
[5:41:44] <%superstarsage> it's whatever they need it to be to encourage players hitting buttons
[5:41:45] <AngryAsian5> Yep
[5:41:45] <%JamesCorck> It doesn't make sense calling it Renegade anymore!
[5:41:46] <+Zyquux> Probably cause you're an officer and goody two shows Paragon follows Alliance protocol about fraternization
[5:41:46] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[5:41:46] <%DrTomT18> you did it, good jonb
[5:41:49] <Sp3ctre48> Renegade Shep can't decide whether he wants to be cool or a psychopath
[5:41:49] <+condemned_15> bold and brash? more like belongs in the trash
[5:41:52] <%jillyrancher> Yeah tbh
[5:41:52] <+Scevda> YA no shit
[5:41:53] <Profmcstevie> Renegade varies from daring and crude to "Fuck it lmao let em die"
[5:41:59] <%joodatious> this one you're a war crimnal
[5:42:00] <Alzero83> Best renegade Option is to Kill Wrex
[5:42:02] <anAngryHamster> Were these scenes written before the team knew the game starts with earth being glassed.
[5:42:03] <tattleworm> here your reaction speed's good
[5:42:04] <Alzero83> mmm
[5:42:06] <%gliph13> In ME3 i just follow my gut
[5:42:07] <%DrTomT18> Don't worry Pat, being a Rengade in this turns you into a genocidal lunitic
[5:42:07] <Maids4lyfe> a confused old man
[5:42:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Paragon is a Narc
[5:42:09] <ScreamLord> A Cartoon villain sometimes
[5:42:10] <%ohno778> It's outright not allowed in the military. Not to say it doesnt happen though.
[5:42:12] <DSD24> You can do some serious evil shit in Renegade Options
[5:42:14] <$hattrick61> Being pissed
[5:42:16] <%JamesCorck> Renegade Shepard has straight up psycho choices in this game.
[5:42:17] <+AmericanSkidd> Also GENICIDLE MANIAC
[5:42:19] <MarylandJutsu> Hey there Aria!
[5:42:22] <+athuramn> after you play me3, you should watching "commanding Sheppard" on YT @patstaresat
[5:42:23] <+condemned_15> citadel
[5:42:24] <%ahomeschooldropout> Renegade in this game is like role-playing as Janeway
[5:42:25] <%joodatious> @Alzero83 seriously dude shut up with spoilers moron
[5:42:26] <%Ranryu692> I want Aria to belittle me <3

[5:42:35] <MarylandJutsu> Aria, said I KNOW PEOPLE
[5:42:40] <%tank7013> I remember reading that they wanted players to not stick to one side so much so they wanted them less black and white evil in this one
[5:42:41] <+rageoftheporo> she got friends
[5:42:41] <%Rumbutt> Aria's so great
[5:42:41] <%jillyrancher> in ME2 Paragon is basically a superhero and Renegade is a loose cannon action badass
[5:42:42] <%ohno778> ARIA SIT ON MY FACE
[5:42:46] <Wolfstriker121> HAHAAH
[5:42:47] <jorniev> DIPLOMATIC INMUNITY
[5:42:49] <%DrTomT18> @AmericanSkidd by my count, being a Rengade means you kill at least 2 to 3 races
[5:42:51] <%subparSamaritan> Goddamn
[5:42:51] <+Totally_Not_Toby> aria's such a loser
[5:42:51] <%idyota> Aria has the Councilor whipped LOL
[5:42:53] <DSD24> Aria does a lot of Gaslighting
[5:42:54] <+condemned_15> my dad owns a dealership!
[5:42:55] <+Scevda> Rule #1

[5:42:56] <SaltyAzteca> SHE IS ABOVE THE LAW
[5:42:58] <MarylandJutsu> ohhhhh yeah
[5:42:58] <Wolfstriker121> big pull
[5:42:59] <%Ranryu692> Aria is the best
[5:43:01] <+Zyquux> FLEX ON ME QUEEN
[5:43:03] <%CalderGaming> goddamn asari government ugh
[5:43:04] <Mattais88> Aria's great
[5:43:05] <+teg88> She did control Omega
[5:43:06] <%subparSamaritan> LOL, nice callback
[5:43:07] <tanarath> BIG SIGMA
[5:43:08] <jorniev> THAT was stupid somehow
[5:43:08] <%gliph13> at LEAST she says "Thank you"
[5:43:08] <%jillyrancher> Tevos sucks so much
[5:43:08] <DatAsuna> Aria sells pillows
[5:43:15] <%IamGrapes> yeah she knows people
[5:43:15] <%Ranryu692> Aria is the one character that I think has the potential to dislodge Paige from Garrus
[5:43:17] <%AJ_Cherenkov> It does seem like they go to fucking lengths to jerk off aria across the series?
[5:43:19] <$hattrick61> Calling the president to deal with your parking tickets
[5:43:20] <%joodatious> Aria got a thicc ass
[5:43:21] <DSD24> Wow you are bad at your job Aria
[5:43:22] <stantheman_97> BIG CORRUPTION
[5:43:22] <+TheBigO75> God she is the best character.
[5:43:27] <MarylandJutsu> ARIA IS PISSED
[5:43:29] <%JamesCorck> There's a book that explains it.
[5:43:30] <+Totally_Not_Toby> aria getting cucked out of omega is the funniest thing about this game
[5:43:31] <+D00msDayDan> Whipped
[5:43:35] <%LeiaSkynoober> Aria is kinda hot tho
[5:43:35] <peachy996> I can't wait for this DLC episode
[5:43:36] <Mattais88> Killed her daughter too
[5:43:37] <%JamesCorck> Cerberus basically killed off her daughter.
[5:43:43] <%jillyrancher> It's in a comic book Pat
[5:43:43] <Sp3ctre48> Bioware REALLY likes Aria
[5:43:45] <%JamesCorck> And she lost Omega because she was horribly unfocused.
[5:43:46] <peachy996> They better not have fixed the animations
[5:43:53] <Daebunz> i wish the citadel dlc was part of the main game and it made aria a full member. always thought party selection was weakest part of me3
[5:43:55] <%DrTomT18> before Omega came out this was 'wait for DLC!'
[5:43:55] <MarylandJutsu> I mean aria is pretty cool
[5:43:55] <%joodatious> big ol dlc
[5:43:56] <%subparSamaritan> That day costs extra
[5:43:59] <%gliph13> I actually really like her DLC, it really builds on her character.
[5:44:00] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 I say it’s 3 streams from now
[5:44:01] <DSD24> Aria is like "I got DLC for you Shepard"
[5:44:04] <%Ranryu692> it's a good, if a bit too long, dlc
[5:44:07] <+tinytinykittycat> big one
[5:44:07] <%DrTomT18> pretty fun DLC
[5:44:09] <+DarkJaguar124> She gets it
[5:44:16] <%jillyrancher> Omega is a large part why Cerberus can field an army
[5:44:24] <Mattais88> Smart Mob Bosses are so neat
[5:44:25] <%DrTomT18> this is a important side mission
[5:44:25] <+Zyquux> Aria "DLC" T'Lok
[5:44:26] <+DarkJaguar124> You get the best ability in that DLC
[5:44:26] <%jillyrancher> lots of resources from that place
[5:44:28] <+robuttastic> aria as a crewmate woulda been FUN
[5:44:33] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf Did they fix the wack spin she does during her speech. Please say they didn't
[5:44:38] <GuilKato> the useless mooks you spent me2 murdering trivially
[5:44:39] <DSD24> Whatever it takes though
[5:44:43] <MarylandJutsu> Omega, Leviathan, and Citadel dlcs are mostly pretty good
[5:44:51] <%subparSamaritan> Shepard did kill like 400 million of them in the last game...
[5:44:52] <RagingLoony> Dah Reeporz
[5:44:53] <xcompleasedad> @jillyrancher So, all the new soldiers are the mercs from ME2? That's actually good writing.
[5:44:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Suicide Squad
[5:44:58] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 They did actually
[5:44:58] <%joodatious> MOOKS ASSEMBLE
[5:45:04] <%ohno778> I can't see Aria taking orders from anyone for too long.
[5:45:06] <%DrTomT18> Do NOT
[5:45:17] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf NO! I'm crushed
[5:45:22] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 I kinda wished they didn’t
[5:45:32] <peachy996> Oh well at least it's in the console version FOREVER
[5:45:33] <%DrTomT18> not right now
[5:45:38] <dawarw0lf> Lean on him. Talk dirty to him
[5:45:39] <%jillyrancher> @xcompleasedad Probably some yeah, also civilians Cerberus press ganged into their army.
[5:45:40] <%joodatious> sad
[5:45:41] <%Treuan> No worries
[5:45:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> Around Batarians never relax
[5:45:45] <DSD24> Good stopping point honestly
[5:45:45] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[5:45:46] <%DrTomT18> night pat, thanks for stream
[5:45:46] <MarylandJutsu> all good pat
[5:45:47] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt  IMHO I don't think theres an "Appropriate" time to do her DLC, and nothing changes depending on your crew. so do it when you want.
[5:45:47] <%JamesCorck> Good idea.
[5:45:48] <+AmericanSkidd> k
[5:45:48] <SaltyAzteca> This was a packed stream
[5:45:49] <%jillyrancher> Take him to dinner
[5:45:49] <%subparSamaritan> Yeah this went a lot longer than I was expecting, good stream!
[5:45:50] <tanarath> cool, later Pat
[5:45:50] <%LeiaSkynoober> That's chill, have a good night!
[5:45:52] <%JamesCorck> Good stream boss.
[5:45:52] <djblue_shift> BibleThump
[5:45:52] <murdocismyhero> Sad panda is sad
[5:45:52] <+DracosMagala> night SeemsGood
[5:45:53] <%Monkeyweed21> fair
[5:45:54] <Profmcstevie> This area is so fucking rich in chatter, it's fine
[5:45:55] <DatAsuna> citadel is packed with content
[5:45:55] <+TheBigO75> Lets raid.
[5:45:57] <%DrTomT18> and it only gets bigger lol
[5:45:57] <falyden> fair, there's a lot of dialog
[5:45:58] <+AmericanSkidd> big
[5:45:59] <%subparSamaritan> Big, juicy stream tonight
[5:45:59] <%joodatious> happy
[5:45:59] <%jillyrancher> Noooooo
[5:46:02] <DatAsuna> This is the stuff people like ME3 for
[5:46:02] <dawarw0lf> That’s fine
[5:46:03] <%TheLakinessMonster> have a good night!
[5:46:04] <%Ranryu692> And the Commons has about as much as the other floors put together
[5:46:06] <Zebroneath> no worries, Citidel is chunky
[5:46:07] <xcompleasedad> @jillyrancher Pretty easy to do that with Indoctrination implants, huh?
[5:46:08] <%jillyrancher> psaDogchamp
[5:46:08] <%rockcentuar> night par
[5:46:08] <%blaccbird914> have a good night
[5:46:09] <%subparSamaritan> Thanks Pat!
[5:46:10] <%joodatious> games been pretty good huh pat?
[5:46:12] <peachy996> Time to see if Paige killed Thunderballs yet
[5:46:15] <Profmcstevie> Rich fucking cake to chew on
[5:46:16] <tanarath> So much more depth than 2
[5:46:22] <%joodatious> hope u been enjoying the game
[5:46:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish this game was just putzing around the Citadel, instead of boring end-of-days plots
[5:46:33] <%jillyrancher> Zangief
[5:46:38] <PaperyHornet1013> No Grayson academy?
[5:46:41] <%Arancet> thats why people liked the multi too
[5:46:42] <%Ranryu692> ME3 is better than ME2 straight up
[5:46:48] <%joodatious> ME2 has terrible filler
[5:46:53] <Mattais88> I can see that
[5:46:54] <%DrTomT18> Mass Effect 2 has a lot more personal stories.
[5:46:56] <dawarw0lf> @ranryu692 Straight up
[5:46:59] <%Ranryu692> ME2's cast and ending are better, but everything else is inferior to ME3
[5:46:59] <tanarath> It's almost like 3 needed a year or two longer.
[5:46:59] <DatAsuna> ME2 gameplaywise is a lot more gears derivative
[5:47:00] <%snow_bush> Don't worry, it shits the bed later
[5:47:03] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt  Have you seen the Extended endings already?
[5:47:09] <%tank7013> A bunch of great stuff you know is essentially gonna be thrown away
[5:47:09] <%Monkeyweed21> the Starchild is in the distance and you can SEE him
[5:47:10] <Zebroneath> we'll get to it when it comes
[5:47:10] <Profmcstevie> Throwing away all that momentum hurts a lot
[5:47:15] <AngryAsian5> Yeah. That's why I always mod the ending LUL
[5:47:19] <%JamesCorck> GG Pat lol
[5:47:20] <%joodatious> more like a stake that the last bite tastes horrible but you enjoyed most of it
[5:47:22] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Its like a great steak, with mayo
[5:47:23] <tanarath> No, it's on point
[5:47:24] <+Zyquux> CANCELLED
[5:47:39] <%jillyrancher> it's like a cake somebody dumps shot over before the last bite
[5:47:41] <%TheLakinessMonster> LOL
[5:47:41] <dawarw0lf> It’s like they coughed after you ate it
[5:47:42] <Mattais88> It' like eating Taco Bell. Good while it happening but you know its going to be a huge shit later
[5:47:44] <+robuttastic> YEAH i felt same when going through LE, i remember liking me2 more than 3 but NOW??? im doubting and kinda bummed me2 had kinda of a very short main story
[5:47:47] <+katarjin> @PerfectPepperPlantPro o0
[5:47:53] <%TheLakinessMonster> She lost her vtuber
[5:47:54] <%bread_assassin> +
[5:47:55] <%CalderGaming> it's like a great steak but all the yelp reviews confirm that the waiter will punch you in the throat when you're done
[5:47:56] <%JamesCorck> She's getting wrecked by big spear floaty guy lol
[5:48:06] <DatAsuna> not NEVER melee
[5:48:11] <DatAsuna> just careful melee
[5:48:15] <%jillyrancher> ME2 is kinda filler but it has tons of great personal stuff
[5:48:25] <%joodatious> what game?
[5:48:37] <DatAsuna> It has the best bioware villain, and iffy gameplay
[5:48:44] <DatAsuna> Yes you can hack everything unlocked
[5:48:58] <%DrTomT18> EA don't give a shit about almost 10 year old game servers
[5:48:59] <%jillyrancher> Yeah dude 360 multiplayer I'd still alive lol
[5:49:00] <%joodatious> ME2 has alot of filler you usually forget about later so people think its a better game then it was
[5:49:07] <+TrevSmith222> The multiplayer is so good.
[5:49:10] <+D00msDayDan> Yeah it’s super easy to cheat lol
[5:49:13] <%Monkeyweed21> even Omega is relatively solid
[5:49:19] <dawarw0lf> That’s a good percentage
[5:49:24] <%jillyrancher> its filler but I love the filler so I dont mind
[5:49:31] <DatAsuna> The ME3 MP is peer to peer which helps keep it alive, but did lead to significant host advantage lol
[5:49:36] <%joodatious> Omega is the worst but better then overlord
[5:49:39] <dawarw0lf> Me 2 is good filler
[5:49:48] <%코코꾸라> Have a good night, Pat!
[5:49:55] <%Gorshum> Cya
[5:49:56] <%JamesCorck> Wooo.
[5:49:59] <%JamesCorck> Good times.
[5:50:01] <%jillyrancher> I'll forgive a lot cause the Suicode Mission is wonderful
[5:50:08] <%jillyrancher> buh bye Pat
[5:50:10] <%DrTomT18> that was fun
[5:50:17] <+TheBigO75> Where we droppin boyz
