[0:14:23] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaDogchamp I take that as a challenge, Father. I will snore louder to make you proud.
[0:14:23] <%walternatorz> I'm not hearing it on my laptop speakers.
[0:14:23] <SovPho> Have you guys noticed that the games that have come out in the last like 2 years haven't been able to grasp people as much as games from pre-2010?
[0:14:24] <$DefNotMac> surprised you're not using nvidia broadcast
[0:14:24] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[0:14:25] <%shurtal> room tone best tone

[0:14:26] <smiggyballs13> No more ambient dog?
[0:14:28] <%Monkeyweed21> did you unsilence Paige's huge farts that she wants to hide?
[0:14:28] <%alyss988> psaSmug
[0:14:29] <%arcielardor> maybe it's my shitty headphones
[0:14:29] <%king_wragles> I actually don't hear any hiss?
[0:14:30] <%KineticZen> I don't hear it with studio monitors
[0:14:31] <%GalacticLatte> sounds like you're using the RTX sound feature
[0:14:31] <+Jaysky> Destroy your room
[0:14:35] <%McSoliace> just room noise
[0:14:36] <@SoFarFetched> Eli's thing is a whole different thing.
[0:14:36] <%Ranryu692> Kentucky?
[0:14:36] <%KineticZen> Even with compression on
[0:14:42] <%shurtal> is eli's problem he has kentucky internet?
[0:14:42] <+skifffs> Oof feels bad man lol
[0:14:44] <%Ynkubus_> Ghost Elis great tho
[0:14:44] <%Axellogic> Hillbilly internet
[0:14:48] <smiggyballs13> Pat just hollowed a little bit after that
[0:14:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The curse of Kentucky
[0:14:54] <%twistedj3ster> pffft
[0:14:54] <%walternatorz> OOF
[0:14:54] <%Romuken> I hear that but it's from my room noise, turns off when i mute my headset's mic
[0:14:57] <NitronStreams> SABOTAGE
[0:15:00] <%Jekado> eli sounds like something on his end and maybe pat having to have him play over the speakers while also the mic
[0:15:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Paige. Of course.
[0:15:05] <amonimis> LUL
[0:15:11] <PanicSwytch> Of course it had to be Paige
[0:15:12] <+Gamblor69> Classic
[0:15:27] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:15:30] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT PATUUHH I DIDNT TOUCH ANYTHING
[0:15:38] <%ironohki> Isn't Eli in like, Nowhere, Kansas?
[0:15:39] <%alyss988> psaDogchamp
[0:15:43] <%king_wragles> I don't recall if Plague ever uses an actual headset. I think he uses earbuds with a built in mic
[0:15:49] <%Romuken> scottfIne
[0:15:50] <%Deft_Thought> I wonder where he learned how to be weird and awkward from
[0:15:50] <bob900000> 👁👁
[0:15:52] <%walternatorz> he's the perfect dog for your household
[0:15:54] <+Jaysky> Your entire household is weird
[0:16:00] <%skyentombment> He clickin
[0:16:01] <smiggyballs13> “Bro my dog is so socially awkward”
[0:16:04] <%twistedj3ster> Eli lives in a metal shack in the desert
[0:16:05] <%Alazull> Dude's speaking of Kentucky, I just had a package that is supposed to show up to my house in Washington leave a facility in Kentucky two hours ago
[0:16:15] <%cherubs_anonymous> You'll probably finish tonight
[0:16:19] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles I believe his mic is seperate from his headset
[0:16:21] <huarrnarg> He’s trying to assassinate y’all
[0:16:21] <%KishinGrek> that's not a nap
[0:16:26] <%walternatorz> I do not know how a 13 hour nap is.
[0:16:27] <+TheotherKristian> So, sleeping correctly...
[0:16:30] <MattoBii> time has no meaning anymore
[0:16:34] <PanicSwytch> Stank the pepk
[0:16:34] <@commanderclaw> Just sleep regular amounts on a regular basis like a normal person
[0:16:38] <+Jaysky> "Do you poopoo or peepee more?"
[0:16:42] <%twistedj3ster> I hope he finishes tonight, I'm not fond of Bayo
[0:16:43] <smiggyballs13> 2020-won!
[0:16:43] <%Mr_Bep> Mr_Bep subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:45] <bob900000> probably not
[0:17:11] <%yoshkosh20> yoshkosh20 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Woo woo
[0:17:22] <@commanderclaw> I wish I could play it, but I don't have a PS4
[0:17:23] <smiggyballs13> No offense Pat, but I will never give you my money.
[0:17:28] <Profmcstevie> You can't have a bullshit crazy story and no upkeep features
[0:17:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats game is cool but it's soooo convoluted
[0:17:30] <%baka_sugoi> RPG of the year
[0:17:33] <%alyss988> woolieOMG
[0:17:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie is at 90%
[0:17:36] <%ironohki> No Sony, Not For You.
[0:17:40] <%Mrbaconator> best story
[0:17:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Dpm
[0:17:49] <%Razputin217> NotLikeThis
[0:17:49] <%Romuken> I need to watch someone play that for real. Saw woolie yesterday but I have NO bloody idea what is going on.
[0:17:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its gets hella confusing
[0:18:02] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[0:18:12] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:18:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is making sooooo many misinterpretation
[0:18:16] <%alyss988> I'm so confused ugh
[0:18:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS INSANE
[0:18:31] <+Dova573> It would drive pat nuts
[0:18:32] <%cvp5127> you'll beat it first LUL
[0:18:34] <%McSoliace> he tends to ramble
[0:18:37] <DianaTheAscian> is that lp even good?
[0:18:37] <bob900000> LUL
[0:18:37] <%twistedj3ster> why would you watch Woolie when you have Pat?
[0:18:39] <%YakumoYomi> Even though I have a PS4, I would very much like Vanillaware's games to escape from Sony. Those games need more recognition.
[0:18:42] <%ironohki> OHNO
[0:18:43] <+Leftovermemes> FUCK
[0:18:43] <%Ranryu692> I think they mean in response to things Woolie says wrong during the theoretical spoilercast
[0:18:43] <%Ipsenscastle> I couldnt get through his first two episodes, they were soooooo fucking slow
[0:18:43] <%AzureGale> SHADE THROWN
[0:18:44] <%walternatorz> watching other people play video games is horribly boring
[0:18:44] <quietshun> Just correct him on a spoilercast
[0:18:49] <%Alazull> @Romuken Just play it yourself, it's about 30 hours long and isn't all that hard
[0:18:50] <@commanderclaw> Don't worry, he only spends 1/3rd of it overthinking instead of playing
[0:18:52] <ShichiNoBushi> "Watching LPs is boring," says LPer.
[0:18:53] <Profmcstevie> He is very satisfied at his GLACIAL PACE in life
[0:18:54] <%Puhff> Wow
[0:18:54] <%Nekros4442> I dunno, they came close to stabbing eachother in Dokapon
[0:18:59] <%weissguard> You worked with Woolie, so you'd know how bad it gets.
[0:18:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> You don't find watching your friend enjoy themselves to be entertaining?
[0:19:01] <%alyss988> lol
[0:19:05] <%walternatorz> ALL THE TIME
[0:19:06] <%twistedj3ster> YES
[0:19:07] <%YakumoYomi> Of course
[0:19:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Woolie is basically playing a game with a different plot with HOW MUCH HE'S MISINTERPRETED XD
[0:19:08] <%Romuken> dont have a ps4 @Alazull
[0:19:08] <@SoFarFetched> you mean now? Kappa
[0:19:09] <+Pachi3000> uh
[0:19:10] <%NovaKnightmare> CONSTANTLY
[0:19:12] <%Ranryu692> is there any other feeling to have?
[0:19:12] <+Pachi3000> YEAH
[0:19:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, a cake maker enjoys eating cake
[0:19:15] <%ArchimerCXV> seems pretty simple, you can have a much more interactive conversation with him in real life
[0:19:15] <%Visorak6> no because you do you man
[0:19:17] <%Agami23> you missed that item in the last of us playthrough?
[0:19:17] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[0:19:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Never. Never ever. Not once.
[0:19:21] <BleedinActionMan> Hmmm
[0:19:23] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL oh shit
[0:19:26] <%Puhff> Yes Kappa
[0:19:27] <Profmcstevie> YOU MEAN A NORMAL FRIENDSHIP
[0:19:28] <%Romuken> Or the money to get it if it is on steam atm @Alazull
[0:19:29] <%AzureGale> I'm getting Three Houses flashbacks here
[0:19:37] <%alyss988> woolieSMUG
[0:19:37] <%ironohki> I mean I get it.
[0:19:43] <DianaTheAscian> frustration +10
[0:19:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> So get in his chat and fuck with him
[0:19:47] <%McSoliace> psaBig doodNo
[0:19:48] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt You'd probably tear out what little hair you have left
[0:19:49] <%walternatorz> something something shield
[0:19:54] <DrkJP520> Yeah, I don't watch Woolie's LPs, I listen to them.
[0:19:58] <%toastybites> So you're saying it's like watching someone make mistakes at the cash register
[0:19:58] <%megaman_sentinel> hi pat
[0:19:59] <%byuniart> Get in his chat and fuck with him
[0:20:04] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:20:05] <+MayorRev> hey no offense to whoever asked pat to play 13 sentinels just because woolie missed some plot points sounds like a massive fucking cunt tbqh
[0:20:10] <%rekinom> Call woolie up and give 'em hell
[0:20:12] <%megaman_sentinel> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:20:19] <%Ranryu692> toxic comments get to another level when you have the person's phone number
[0:20:21] <%ironohki> Pat's saying this in a Pat way, but it's honestly a reasonable point.
[0:20:24] <%alyss988> You can't it's emote only
[0:20:33] <%saadi90> Woolie forgot how transistor ends
[0:20:36] <%skyentombment> Do what Plague did in among us, give him purposely bad advice
[0:20:37] <ShichiNoBushi> I'd say "watch it live and participate in chat", but you stated you prefer VODs.
[0:20:43] <@SoFarFetched> Remember when you and Woolie were arguing super hard about that locked Door in Omikron because he was super blind and deaf
[0:20:44] <@commanderclaw> Woolie picks the *worst* games to LP TBH
[0:20:44] <DianaTheAscian> I will prob not watch anytime soon
[0:20:44] <bob900000> LUL
[0:20:51] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:20:53] <%walternatorz> uhh careful

[0:20:55] <%alyss988> LUL
[0:20:59] <%walternatorz> :)
[0:21:00] <%Alazull> @Romuken Fair enough, sorry to hear it
[0:21:01] <quietshun> It's absolutely spoilable
[0:21:01] <%Mrbaconator> pat an army of squirrels caused the aliens to time travel @PatStaresAt
[0:21:02] <%eyezehuhh> I'll wait for his best of
[0:21:04] <%superc37> @patstaresat aliens did t
[0:21:04] <DianaTheAscian> Crab people
[0:21:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> yeah careful
[0:21:06] <himbearbedtime> damn you played that far?
[0:21:06] <%Ipsenscastle> @commanderclaw for real, it's like he's going out of his way to do it
[0:21:08] <Profmcstevie> "bears in trucks are controlling teenagers in Japan" ......well maybe sounds plausible
[0:21:10] <+SilverDevilfish> They're all actually cats in the business dimension being herded by Eri
[0:21:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Cyberpunk 2077 is integral to the plot of 13 sentinels
[0:21:13] <smiggyballs13> Pat Aliens though!
[0:21:16] <+TheotherKristian> What!? Phillip deFranco? What are you doing in 13 Sentinels?
[0:21:18] <smiggyballs13> Aliens
[0:21:19] <bob900000> how did you know!
[0:21:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE CRAB PEOPLE PAT
[0:21:28] <NeonBleu> You got to the ants part?
[0:21:29] <%twistedj3ster> Speaking of Omikron, Cyberpunk's traffic system is eerily similar
[0:21:30] <%Bailey__gaming> CRAB PEOPLE
[0:21:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Dokapon was Woolie's best LP and he was the worst part of it
[0:21:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:21:39] <%alyss988> psaWink
[0:21:40] <%Agami23> crab people crab people. walk like crab, talk like people
[0:21:41] <@commanderclaw> Tastes like crab, talks like people
[0:21:41] <Profmcstevie> Dude when they fought Michael Jacksons stand in 13 sentinels? what a chapter dude
[0:21:41] <reonome> WALK LIKE CRAB
[0:21:42] <sendart> evolve to crab
[0:21:42] <huarrnarg> Number 4 was a ghost child of number 7s neighbors dogs Vergil
[0:21:43] <smiggyballs13> WALK LIKE CRAB
[0:21:44] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt okay, so one student with big honkers exists, but then another student comes in with even BIGGER bahakonados, and their bazongajibos turn into robots to fight the evil Dante demons.
[0:21:44] <%Dakuu75> how close is Pat to beting Bayo 2, now?
[0:21:48] <%Bailey__gaming> Hey Pat how are you? :)
[0:22:02] <+Jaysky> Paper Mario Thousand Year Door was a great LP
[0:22:11] <smiggyballs13> BECOME CREBS

[0:22:24] <%McSoliace> gee i wonder which
[0:22:25] <%Alazull> EgoRaptor?
[0:22:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Whoever hasn't played 13 Sentinels and is sort of interested in Vanillaware games, play 13 Sentinels.
[0:22:26] <Profmcstevie> Poop, free
[0:22:27] <%Ipsenscastle> poop probably

[0:22:41] <bob900000> really
[0:22:44] <lazypointer> I think shitting on scream would be the opposie of poison
[0:22:50] <%Broand> it's career gold!
[0:22:50] <spawnzie> as you've proven
[0:22:50] <%twistedj3ster> we can't prove he's NOT shitting right now
[0:22:52] <Profmcstevie> It's career lubricant
[0:22:52] <%McSoliace> that's content
[0:22:53] <%Ipsenscastle> he's doing it right now
[0:22:54] <%Bailey__gaming> Wlll you stream or watch the Resi Evil Village thing ? PS does Paige like the BIG vampire lady?
[0:22:56] <%Ne1son> its on brand
[0:22:56] <%Ranryu692> it's just embarassing
[0:22:57] <lazypointer> Yeah, more people would arrive to see it happen
[0:22:57] <%rekinom> That's brown gold, that is
[0:22:58] <%Konquerer> that's content
[0:22:59] <%Romuken> it's content if anything
[0:23:01] <%toastybites> It's everbrown content
[0:23:02] <%Dakuu75> it's NOT A CAREER BOOSTER though
[0:23:03] <+Jaysky> We'd laugh and make a meme
[0:23:05] <%Monkeyweed21> it would boost your numbers so high
[0:23:05] <smiggyballs13> Woolie “Blackface is dope” Darlington
[0:23:06] <%Ipsenscastle> pooped 'em
[0:23:06] <devanmuse> Shitting your pants on stream would make you a LEGEND
[0:23:07] <%alyss988> He hasn't done it already?
[0:23:08] <+Cobaltor_252> it's career diareha
[0:23:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat would get donations for shitting his pants on stream.
[0:23:12] <%skyentombment> It wouldn't be stream poison, but it'd be complete Pat poison
[0:23:13] <jorniev> thats the first thing i hear when i get here huh?
[0:23:13] <%walternatorz> you would lose the bet.
[0:23:13] <%Ancopro> poopchamp
[0:23:13] <@SoFarFetched> Pat would get new subscribers
[0:23:13] <%Spydurman> I'd sub harder if he shit himself
[0:23:15] <Noogiez> yo
[0:23:15] <leinadtonu> O O O P S I E
[0:23:18] <NitronStreams> The day Pat Shits his pants on stream is the day he becomes mainstream
[0:23:19] <huarrnarg> Doing the walk is career poison
[0:23:19] <%Broand> the DSP technique
[0:23:21] <+Pachi3000> Arin shart on Game Grumps and he's still going lol
[0:23:22] <voltage996> do it you won’t
[0:23:23] <+SilverDevilfish> ah the DSP masturbation strategy
[0:23:23] <@commanderclaw> So it's the break the glass option?
[0:23:24] <Profmcstevie> DO A SPONSORED STREAM RIGHT AFTER YOU SHIT YOURSELF
[0:23:25] <%AkronymCLT> It's not the pant shitting that's the poison it's HOW you shit your pants that kills you
[0:23:25] <valriot> Pat wtf shave your head
[0:23:25] <+BigDumBeak> sounds like you should shit your pants...
[0:23:28] <bob900000> what about paige
[0:23:29] <+MayorRev> stonks
[0:23:31] <%skyentombment> there would be no stream, you'd be mortified
[0:23:32] <%rekinom> The DSP effect
[0:23:33] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Shitting your pants on stream is undoubtedly a short-term career boost from a viral perspective.
[0:23:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat would shit his pants while maintaining eye contact with the camera
[0:23:38] <%twistedj3ster> I would teir 3 if he shit himself
[0:23:42] <%Mrbaconator> you could also super deny it and just cut to break
[0:23:46] <Protochimp> racist tirade? go on
[0:23:51] <smiggyballs13> Here I’ll give you 20 bucks for new underwear
[0:23:52] <+TheotherKristian> You shitting your pants on stream would end up in my Youtube recommended page two years from now.
[0:23:56] <+Jaysky> The race wars start NOW
[0:23:56] <%Ipsenscastle> that seems not true?

[0:37:46] <%Nekros4442> eh, Coding is just a 2nd language. You can speak French close enough
[0:37:46] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> wish I could go to school to learn cod
[0:37:48] <%G_Thunders> Gave up on Cyberpunk at the start of Act 3, does the story get any better or should I just wait for updates? Anybody who beat the game know?
[0:37:49] <%AzureGale> Codding - doing stuff with cod fish
[0:37:50] <%BagofLotions> lol thank you pat
[0:37:53] <Ultralazuli> he snore
[0:37:57] <smiggyballs13> Now are we COD 4ing?
[0:37:57] <%Axellogic> Isnt CODing just screaming racist remarks while doing 360 headshots
[0:37:57] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt You're making a living of the video games, you're already MUCH smarter than us coders for having a better lifestyle, lol.
[0:38:01] <shotgang86> (I joke I respect every frontend developer that I know)
[0:38:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is so Tsun for Daigo. Its cute how much he likes him
[0:38:18] <%Blank9> kiryu shouldn't have done that to daigo
[0:38:32] <jorniev> OOOH RIGHT
[0:38:37] <@commanderclaw> Pat judges characters based on the worst things they do
[0:38:38] <jorniev> I FORGOT
[0:38:41] <%twistedj3ster> but his summon is cool
[0:38:41] <slix3431> Pat is lame
[0:38:42] <+rdark_ksu> hey 30 mil us aint chump change
[0:38:46] <SmolBluGhost> Woooowwww
[0:38:46] <jorniev> WHY THOUGH DAIGO
[0:38:46] <MattoBii> oh geez I totally forgot
[0:38:47] <%Blank9> majima wasn't even a part of the tojo again until 3 though
[0:38:47] <smiggyballs13> I think Pat doesn’t like men that are more handsome than him.
[0:38:48] <%Maids4lyfe> FUCK DAIGO
[0:38:49] <%MisterRockett> MisterRockett subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey Pat! 12 monthaversary! Time for my monthly fun fact! IT WAS TO REBUILD TO TOJO CLAN, PAT.
[0:38:50] <%Ancopro> he was gonna fuck over THE boy
[0:38:50] <smiggyballs13> Oh wait
[0:38:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES A CRIME BOSS
[0:38:53] <%Blank9> and then didn't do anything to solve the problem in 3
[0:38:53] <mo0ody2090> More importantly where the is sayama kaorou in the rest of the series ?
[0:38:55] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @commanderclaw is it should be
[0:38:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Daigo's only qualifications are that his dad was a rapist
[0:38:58] <%Visorak6> Isnt 30m US more than most issues in yakuza deal with?
[0:39:01] <%eyezehuhh> oh well fuck that guy
[0:39:02] <RyuuAoi> Pat holds grudges
[0:39:04] <$Protochimp> FUCK DAIGO
[0:39:08] <%shurtal> Daigo needs to jump off the Millenium Tower
[0:39:09] <%Alazull> Ey yo he tried to fuck over Majima fuck him
[0:39:10] <RyuuAoi> ANGRIEST PAT
[0:39:10] <%Blank9> you headbutt his punch and hurt his hand
[0:39:10] <$RealThiele> i mean some people sellout their country for a twitter bump
[0:39:11] <%Taisuru> 4 had a lot of weird plot stuff that bugged me like that
[0:39:13] <%kyh9> I’d let my friends go to jail for $30 million
[0:39:15] <spyrashnz> No shit
[0:39:26] <@commanderclaw> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Not arguing with the method, it's just important to realize the framework being used
[0:39:28] <%kyh9> I’d definitely let my friends go to jail for $30 million
[0:39:35] <RyuuAoi> Well it never happened!
[0:39:37] <%Monkeyweed21> rubber bullets is the peak of Yakuza 4
[0:39:45] <%KishinGrek> I remember the bear fight better
[0:39:46] <%twistedj3ster> @kyh9 your friends aren't GORO MAJIMA
[0:39:54] <bob900000> 4 story was a bit of a mess
[0:39:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH RLY?
[0:39:56] <MattoBii> Kappa
[0:39:57] <Profmcstevie> What's Daigos BEST action then, does he do some good?
[0:39:57] <Chatterbox1991> B U L L S H I T
[0:39:59] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @commanderclaw if you aren't born pure and perfect and stay that way forever then you are a piece of shit till you die
[0:40:06] <$Protochimp> cheer500 speaking of yakuza 6, you seemed very disappointed in that game by the end, what are your thoughts looking back on it? fuck daigo
[0:40:08] <%Daxalog> Define "SLIGHT"
[0:40:08] <Badgerconda_> NEVER FORGIVE
[0:40:13] <RyuuAoi> How else?
[0:40:19] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp *SNORE*
[0:40:20] <%0rond> 0rond subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! I recently watched a speedrun of bayonetta 1, and the strat they use for jeanne 2 is crazy, you basically climb on the plane right at the start this triggers a fight on a small side where you kick her off which insta kills her. Highly recommanded.
[0:40:22] <%kyh9> @twistedj3ster I’d let Majima go to jail for $30 million too. Maybe pay his bail with some of that
[0:40:23] <RyuuAoi> Pat forgave me.
[0:40:24] <jorniev> AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT ACTUAL ASSHOLES
[0:40:31] <smiggyballs13> Man, I have a friend who doesn’t want new friends ever
[0:40:32] <%kyh9> People are their worst actions
[0:40:36] <%Alazull> Would you say you let people establish a pattern of behavior and judge them on it?
[0:40:38] <%Blank9> Daigo's best action in the series is trying his best between 2 and 3 to cover for Kiryu to allow him to live at the orphanage without interference.
[0:40:39] <smiggyballs13> He hates everything everyone does
[0:40:39] <$StrawberryPantsu> behoove!? Haven't had that word since I got out of the Military 3 years ago...
[0:40:41] <%kyh9> You’re only as good as your lowest moment
[0:40:41] <%Blank9> That's it.
[0:40:48] <@commanderclaw> The Moral Event Horizon
[0:40:49] <%Daxalog> Whats the line?
[0:40:50] <%kyh9> You have to have a moral floor
[0:40:50] <%snow_bush> Is your line Specops?
[0:40:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> "What am I willing to put up with today?"
[0:41:01] <himbearbedtime> creation of a victim?
[0:41:04] <cherrycottontail> are we talking about cyberpunk
[0:41:06] <RyuuAoi> "My biggest enemy is me. Pop a 911."
[0:41:07] <%kyh9> You are your moral floor. You’re only as good as your worst moment
[0:41:11] <+LowBatteryLife> The line is hurting other people without remorse.
[0:41:13] <%Blank9> but pat, what if they were "in a dark place"?
[0:41:14] <RyuuAoi> Yeah don't cross that line.
[0:41:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> like that fucker who reset the Ps2 while hou were playing fighting games?
[0:41:17] <Profmcstevie> here is bar, here is you. You do not return above bar
[0:41:18] <smiggyballs13> Wow classic game grumps quotes in chat
[0:41:19] <OswaldTheDog> I’m the same way
[0:41:21] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> the Chad Grudgeholder versus the virgin Forgiving Cuck
[0:41:22] <jorniev> is that what happened
[0:41:23] <%Dakuu75> I think pat's line is pretty far away though. considering all the fun shit we talk about in this pat-based-fandom
[0:41:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @GarbageQueenEllie "NOT FUCKING THIS"

[0:42:06] <%Blank9> jokes on you, I was ignored
[0:42:09] <smiggyballs13> Been bullied my whole life
[0:42:12] <$RealThiele> retail work
[0:42:14] <%Emperor_Machinus> Elementary / Middle school
[0:42:15] <%Ranryu692> a bit in middle school, but I was bigger than everybody else, and wasn't afraid to hit back, so it was pretty mild
[0:42:17] <$RealThiele> FUCK THAT GUY STILL
[0:42:18] <RyuuAoi> @geno4344 You're not alone. You're with all of us! artesi1Rgbheart
[0:42:20] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> you already told this story on the podcast, next bit
[0:42:29] <smiggyballs13> I got bullied by my whole grade from 10-12
[0:42:35] <%Huntercd> !uptime
[0:42:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 42m 47s.
[0:42:36] <NitronStreams> i wasnt bullied
[0:42:37] <+Delenay> i was ignored because i was bullied, i was given no hope
[0:42:37] <%skyentombment> I was bullied all of elementary through middle school
[0:42:37] <RyuuAoi> I don't remember this story.
[0:42:38] <%KishinGrek> was it woolie?
[0:42:39] <RyuuAoi> Tell it
[0:42:40] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Pat is flexing his psychology muscles here. I'm digging it.
[0:42:43] <Badgerconda_> fuuuuuuuck that
[0:42:44] <+Delenay> help
[0:42:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wow
[0:42:47] <%Mrbaconator> fuck horrible people
[0:42:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> But Pat is fueled by spite
[0:42:48] <%byuniart> It was Woolie
[0:42:49] <@commanderclaw> Forgiveness is when we let go of anger
[0:42:50] <jorniev> there is a limit to that
[0:42:50] <Profmcstevie> Forgiveness is for bitches, vengeance warms the soul
[0:42:52] <%SGrim> Fuck them, live in spite.
[0:42:53] <%Ipsenscastle> fuck that
[0:42:54] <+Delenay> no
[0:42:55] <Badgerconda_> forgiveness is for the weak.
[0:42:57] <%Mahbonk> Have they grown up or are they still assholes ?
[0:42:58] <%Ynkubus_> Nah fuckem
[0:43:02] <RyuuAoi> Remember when Woolie killed that guy in football?
[0:43:02] <+LowBatteryLife> I learned to run very fast thanks to bullies! Track coach wanted me. I wanted to disappear.
[0:43:05] <smiggyballs13> I just forget
[0:43:05] <%Blank9> Persona 2 has the best line about that in it
[0:43:06] <+TopTieramisu> you don't have to forgive woolie for the pies
[0:43:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat that's not forgiveness LUL
[0:43:09] <%captainpodock> Gief so loud!
[0:43:10] <devanmuse> You can make peace with someone WITHOUT forgiving them
[0:43:10] <+Jaysky> They can think about it forever if they want
[0:43:11] <%Daxalog> And not even cool like I have no mouth and I must scream
[0:43:12] <shotgang86> I was bullied through all I my days on school and I hope every single one burns in HELL. And I'm 34.
[0:43:12] <jorniev> I DONT HATE YOU, BUT I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
[0:43:13] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> THE BEST FORGIVENESS IS LIVING WELL HUH?
[0:43:14] <maddragon249> Nah fuck that
[0:43:16] <+Medvp> I was bullied until I turned 6ft3 in grade 8th and became a middle school protector
[0:43:17] <Geno4344> I want to be bullied by a smug brown skinned tomboy tbh
[0:43:20] <RyuuAoi> Forgive yes but don't forget.
[0:43:24] <%skyentombment> In fact, you oughta do it for you most of anythin
[0:43:25] <+ninja_galt> Bayonetta bow chika wow wow
[0:43:26] <%Blank9> where the worst phrase in the world is "I'm sorry" because it puts all the responsibility on the listener
[0:43:28] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Absolutely agree, people who hurt you can try to get back into your life, but you don't owe them your time
[0:43:32] <RyuuAoi> Forgive your your own peace of mind.
[0:43:37] <+Medvp> Forgive, but dont forget.
[0:43:49] <jorniev> LIKE IN BOJACK HORSEMAN
[0:43:51] <RyuuAoi> Naw tell them. Kill them with kindness. People hate happy people.
[0:43:51] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL

[0:44:12] <fatlystackedmac> suhhh
[0:44:13] <%ironohki> I walked away for a sec, who apologized badly?
[0:44:13] <@commanderclaw> How nuanced
[0:44:14] <%coreyyotto> so what's your opinion on My Name is Earl
[0:44:14] <%Visorak6> Learn from it
[0:44:15] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:44:16] <+Gamblor69> I like Pat real talk times.
[0:44:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> <3
[0:44:16] <BigNerdSam> I think back to that episode of Bojack Horseman where Bojack tries to get a former coworker to forgive him and the guy says "No, fuck you, I know why you're apologizing and I will die without forgiving you because I hate you"
[0:44:16] <Badgerconda_> forgiving is for the weak. the strong choose JUSTICE.
[0:44:17] <brandenopoli5> im really connecting with pat on a spiritual level right now
[0:44:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wow Spite dot exe
[0:44:18] <%whyskeywolfe> I love and support how working class Pat is.
[0:44:19] <jorniev> TRUE
[0:44:19] <%Mrbaconator> HELL YEA
[0:44:19] <%Alazull> Maybe teach your children not to suck if it bothers you pricks!
[0:44:19] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> Hell I cheered out loud when a guy who bullied me was killed
[0:44:20] <+AngriestAngryArtist> but pat what if that guy is super rich tho?
[0:44:24] <+TopTieramisu> umehara?
[0:44:26] <devanmuse> @PatStaresAt Don't be sorry; Be Better
[0:44:27] <+grim_alex95> He is right
[0:44:28] <RyuuAoi> Pat someone stealing your car?
[0:44:29] <%ironohki> Oh Daigo.
[0:44:30] <smiggyballs13> Hmmm. Sage words.
[0:44:31] <ToneBacas> the male nurse?
[0:44:32] <bettysharkface> I actually had a bully contact me a few years after high school and apologize profusely for his behavior, and he's now a pretty chill gay man.
[0:44:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DAIGO IS A GAME CHARACTER THO
[0:44:35] <%jojonotcrash> jojonotcrash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! sup boss
[0:44:35] <%Monkeyweed21> pat that is the opposite of forgiveness
[0:44:35] <Geno4344> daigo betrayed... what? What happened?
[0:44:37] <RyuuAoi> Oh that car alarm on my end...
[0:44:40] <KasGiD> I am late, what happened to Daigo?
[0:44:40] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what about Katz?
[0:44:41] <%Blank9> what about majima totally beating up women
[0:44:48] <giogio346> wait what did daigo do?
[0:44:51] <%ironohki> @PatStaresAt Don't be better, be Patter. Be more Pat.
[0:44:53] <faithless_zealot> People are basically a completely different person every 4 years, tho. Not a single cell in their body is the same
[0:44:54] <%Taisuru> @Geno4344 Yakiza Daigo not FGC Daigo
[0:44:54] <+RealPT1> who do what now?
[0:44:56] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> you literally said holding grudges forever is okay
[0:44:57] <+LowBatteryLife> I've taken apologies that I appreciated very much, but i've also just... let shit go, but not forgotten.
[0:44:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Super Opposite
[0:44:58] <OswaldTheDog> mmm and that’s the real tea
[0:44:58] <+ninja_galt> turn the other cheek and brap
[0:44:59] <kikaliq2> im loss
[0:45:00] <RyuuAoi> @kasgid Pay buried him.
[0:45:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat says "Hold grudges!"
[0:45:03] <%king_wragles> Ya, that was a lot of words to say "just hold a silent grudge"
[0:45:06] <Profmcstevie> Maaaaybe not a pinpoint concept of forgiveness....BUT HE GOT THE SPIRIT
[0:45:10] <smiggyballs13> Yea that sounds like spite
[0:45:11] <Geno4344> oh. All I know about FGC Daigo is that he's the ken parry man
[0:45:11] <RyuuAoi> SHIT KID
[0:45:11] <%MidnightBurst12> there is a limit to forgiveness
[0:45:13] <%Taisuru> He's talking about Yakuza Daigo you dunces
[0:45:13] <%YakumoYomi> Daigo from Yakuza
[0:45:13] <%Mrbaconator> there are levels, some you can forgive others you cant
[0:45:16] <%baka_sugoi> fuled by revenge
[0:45:17] <%Agami23> pats never been more right
[0:45:17] <%Blank9> pat with the book of grudges
[0:45:21] <%Monkeyweed21> fair
[0:45:21] <wambiway> I think actions speak louder than words
[0:45:24] <@commanderclaw> You'd think that
[0:45:26] <%whyskeywolfe> Could you forgive the lady from Princess Mononoke for shooting the boar which destroyed your village?
[0:45:28] <+Delenay> dont need to hold grudges by never thinking about them again
[0:45:28] <%Ipsenscastle> forgiveness is a trap
[0:45:30] <%Broand> "I don't hold petty grudges, but holy petty grudges!"
[0:45:31] <amonimis> forgive and never forget
[0:45:32] <%0rond> you waste your time getting angry at people that DO forgive
[0:45:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Here we go!
[0:45:43] <%KishinGrek> how do you feel about the redeemable villan?
[0:45:44] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt But what if the person who did the malicious cruelty is truly repentant?
[0:45:45] <%Agami23> man fuck my dad.
[0:45:46] <%Maids4lyfe> FAMILY IS THE WORST
[0:45:47] <%AzureGale> Yep
[0:45:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> Yeah!
[0:45:50] <%ironohki> Moral advice from Pat? Seems legit.
[0:45:51] <%eyezehuhh> already have
[0:45:52] <%king_wragles> LUL
[0:45:53] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> but you spend time with twitch chat and twitter
[0:45:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nothing wrong with cutting toxic people out of your life. Consequences.
[0:45:55] <%WutangchickeN> YES I LIKE THIS
[0:45:55] <%superc37> forgiveness is never something one should expect from the person they wronged
[0:45:55] <$RealThiele> especially family
[0:45:55] <kikaliq2> just popped in didnt know who he was talkin about
[0:45:56] <ToneBacas> i'm not sure there's any catharsis in forgiving your childhood bully.
[0:45:56] <OswaldTheDog> MAN FUCK FAMILY
[0:45:57] <%YakumoYomi> I'd hold a bigger grudge against family, quite frankly
[0:45:58] <%WutangchickeN> NO DO IT
[0:45:59] <amonimis> LUL
[0:46:00] <DianaTheAscian> BLOOD MEANS NOTHING
[0:46:00] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:46:02] <%0rond> on the podcast you and woolie waste your time getting angry at people that DO forgive
[0:46:03] <%wibbwobbler> cutt people out of my life, have literally never been happier lol
[0:46:04] <%AXL808> laugh on the inside
[0:46:05] <%Mrbaconator> my mother is an insufferable sack of shit and i will enjoy the day she dies greatly
[0:46:05] <valriot> Why would i go to their funeral????
[0:46:06] <%Konquerer> do it anyway
[0:46:06] <%TIME_PUNCHER> laugh openly if they deserve it
[0:46:06] <smiggyballs13> I just stopped caring. I’m in the process of letting other people not get to me.
[0:46:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> NAH DO IT LIKE TIDUS
[0:46:07] <%Visorak6> Family is the worst bullies
[0:46:07] <%KishinGrek> uhoh
[0:46:08] <%Nekros4442> Half of my extended family are Trumpists.....
[0:46:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> DO IT ANYWAY
[0:46:08] <Profmcstevie> But you will be remembered forever as the man who laughed at the dead......ETERNAL FAME
[0:46:09] <devanmuse> Pat's the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral. Don't know what he means? Well, you soon will
[0:46:10] <%Emperor_Machinus> BuT It'S FaMiLy...
[0:46:10] <%king_wragles> Pat has rollback confimred
[0:46:12] <+Jaysky> I've got a sister who is a manipulative cunt whose physically absurd my disabled dad who I'll never forgive.
[0:46:13] <%Agami23> fuck class
[0:46:13] <%Ranryu692> also you might get investigated
[0:46:14] <%AzureGale> Sometimes though, enough is enough
[0:46:14] <wambiway> you can say your sorry but if your not doing anything to be a better then it means nothing
[0:46:16] <+ninja_galt> I like all my fam. Lucky me.
[0:46:17] <%SGrim> I didn't laugh at my grandfathers funeral. But I did the second it ended. LUL
[0:46:22] <ShichiNoBushi> According to Dante's Divine Comedy, the 9th Circle (the deepest circle) of Inferno is reserved for betrayers. The 8th Circle is for killers.
[0:46:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Sometimes I wonder about my own moral compass. Then I watch Pat.
[0:46:23] <+Gamblor69> "You can laugh, Kaz. We're all thinking it"
[0:46:26] <RyuuAoi> I mean....
[0:46:26] <+Jaysky> *assault
[0:46:30] <%psydaku> can anyone else hear zangief snoring?
[0:46:30] <+froduck42> Geif snoring?
[0:46:33] <%captainpodock> Pat would you respect the people more of they acknowledge they were a total piece of shot and leave it at that. Not say sorry but at least have the temerity to admit they were a piece of shit?
[0:46:36] <+LowBatteryLife> Actually, yes, folks who ain't got your back, particularly family who ain't got your back? Fuck 'em. Even if you've made mistakes. That's your family, how do they not have your back.
[0:46:36] <faithless_zealot> Pat's sassy today...
[0:46:39] <%Monkeyweed21> having seen someone go from abusive drunk wracked with PTSD to morally upstanding saint that helps the homeless I suppose I have a different perspective
[0:46:41] <%KishinGrek> I land on spitting on my father's grave, fuck class
[0:46:42] <%Blank9> Majima was given The Hills
[0:46:46] <%Alazull> ESPECIALLY SINCE SEVERAL YEARS LATER DAIGO DISSOLVES THE TOJO
[0:46:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Wasn't that Dojima
[0:46:47] <+ninja_galt> put Zangief on dog steroids
[0:46:48] <%Agami23> crazy talk has deactivated by how RIGHT pat is.
[0:46:52] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> Twitch streamer and local twitter addict Pat Boivin says: "I could spend time with people who aren't shitty."
[0:46:54] <MattoBii> that scene in Kiwami 2 where Majima has LITERAL WHEELBARROWS full of money
[0:46:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> At least before he died
[0:47:00] <jorniev> WOW
[0:47:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Nero would openly laugh at Dante's funeral
[0:47:05] <Madovir> if they pay you?
[0:47:06] <RyuuAoi> Prob not at the funeral, Pat ha
[0:47:08] <%WutangchickeN> majima all the time was more successful than even the fucking tojo IN THE EIGHTIES
[0:47:11] <%Mahbonk> damn boi be snoring loud as fuck
[0:47:12] <Virokwet> why would that be better
[0:47:13] <%Konquerer> blood sacrifice
[0:47:14] <%TIME_PUNCHER> wait I mean Vergil fuck
[0:47:16] <HotMafia81> Boye, Zangief is snoring fucking LOUD rn
[0:47:17] <%Super_Breed> Super_Breed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:47:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> $10,000?
[0:47:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> A toothless succ?
[0:47:31] <$valkuma> no, because most of the time people that call themselves assholes or peices of shit , arent
[0:47:31] <+ninja_galt> strong snores from strong pupper
[0:47:33] <%AXL808> redemption requires sacrifice
[0:47:37] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> punch the child?
[0:47:38] <+LowBatteryLife> For the guy who flipped me off on the road yesterday? I own that. My fault. You were right to be mad, I should have had my signal on.
[0:47:38] <+Medvp> hahaha yes I can hear Zangief, reminds me of my old boxer
[0:47:39] <RyuuAoi> Man, kids suck.
[0:47:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> For me, I guess it depends on the action itself, and whether the repentance is sincere.
[0:47:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ...
[0:47:53] <+Jaysky> Impossible
[0:47:54] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> I CALLED IT
[0:47:55] <%Ynkubus_> LUL
[0:47:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> What if they go "I FUCKING LOVED BEING A PIECE OF SHIT"
[0:47:56] <%machshop> but that's impossible pat
[0:47:56] <bob900000> Jesus
[0:47:57] <ToneBacas> so bully himself?
[0:47:57] <%SGrim> Nice
[0:47:59] <+TopTieramisu> oh, so completely fictional hypothetical
[0:47:59] <faithless_zealot> ...
[0:48:00] <Noogiez> soo the answer is no then?
[0:48:00] <%AXL808> cool
[0:48:00] <$StrawberryPantsu> Id do that tbh
[0:48:01] <%Blank9> sweet, a chance to bully a child
[0:48:01] <$KnivesEve> yes
[0:48:01] <DianaTheAscian> just an inch?
[0:48:01] <RyuuAoi> .....hmmmmmm
[0:48:02] <%Mrbaconator> oh lord i would do it in a heart beat child me was a sack of shit
[0:48:03] <+ninja_galt> I'd make my teenage self join the air force.
[0:48:05] <Noogiez> haha
[0:48:05] <Profmcstevie> Punch a child....you are the child, go back in time
[0:48:06] <Valkryna> luaThonk
[0:48:06] <%KineticZen> I can see why you love Twitter
[0:48:07] <%bigbrothergannon> hmmm
[0:48:07] <%machshop> i did yes
[0:48:08] <wambiway> so that's a no then
[0:48:09] <Madovir> pat "time travel child violence" boivin
[0:48:10] <%Arsenic_8> id ask where you got the time machine
[0:48:14] <jorniev> YES
[0:48:14] <redrins> LUL
[0:48:15] <SmolBluGhost> thats fair LUL
[0:48:17] <%Romuken> yo remember that one bodybuilder toddler?
[0:48:18] <%coreyyotto> Okay but fr give me a time machine and THE FIRST thing I'd do with it is kick my own ass
[0:48:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat the point was when they say they're not sorry at all
[0:48:20] <amonimis> LUL
[0:48:21] <%machshop> it would have already happened
[0:48:22] <$StrawberryPantsu> Really Petty though
[0:48:23] <+saltytyrz> I don't want it at all
[0:48:25] <%captainpodock> So they must bully their children?
[0:48:27] <%AXL808> "stick your hand in this bear trap"
[0:48:28] <%Broand> yeesh
[0:48:28] <faithless_zealot> Damn... Pat you must've gotten bullied HARD
[0:48:29] <dmtjinni> Pat the Crazy Canadian
[0:48:31] <RyuuAoi> I mean I'd go back and tell them to change their ways but not beat myself.
[0:48:32] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> "You can punch the child, but you only get one"
[0:48:32] <$manic_kun> pat should have access to a time machine, seems like a good time
[0:48:35] <+LowBatteryLife> I would totally beat my child self within an inch of my life with NO IMPETUS, lil shit deserves it
[0:48:36] <+TheotherKristian> Kind of hard to time travel with all of the covid going round
[0:48:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but what if they did?
[0:48:42] <%byuniart> You are the pettiest man. Good energy
[0:48:43] <TioXyco> what if he said "I would if I could" ? would that coult?
[0:48:47] <%machshop> okay
[0:48:48] <+Jaysky> YEYE
[0:48:51] <Badgerconda_> gotta fight your dad, man.
[0:48:52] <RyuuAoi> No Pat BITES. He was the BULLY.
[0:48:53] <%Romuken> OOF
[0:48:55] <faithless_zealot> That is ALL but inevitable
[0:48:57] <+Jaysky> Destroy the masters
[0:48:57] <%W1nterTitan> LUL
[0:48:58] <Badgerconda_> take shrooms, battle your parents on the astral plane.
[0:48:59] <$RealThiele> too late
[0:49:00] <bob900000> .......
[0:49:01] <%Alazull> The point is that a lot of people think saying sorry is enough to completely absolve you of really shitty behavior
[0:49:01] <+ninja_galt> We live in a society that failed me
[0:49:02] <%MidnightBurst12> I'd do it
[0:49:03] <RyuuAoi> FIGHT YOUR BROTHER
[0:49:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat what if they clone themselve and beat their child clone?
[0:49:06] <%AXL808> that's not fair, parents are a tag team
[0:49:07] <%r0chelimit> I feel like there are some people that try to hide behind the fact that they are pieces of shit to make an excuse for themselves. Like saying "you shouldn't be too mad at me, because you know what a terrible person i am. So you should be a good person and forgive me."
[0:49:07] <%Mrbaconator> im surprised i haven't turned out way worse
[0:49:10] <+Medvp> I think I dont forgive people, I just forget about them instead of focusing on the shit they did
[0:49:10] <%arcielardor> I'd do that even if you didn't ask me to.
[0:49:11] <%coreyyotto> I mean like if I could go back and beat the ever loving shit out of 12 year old me it would fix so many things in my life
[0:49:13] <Profmcstevie> Erase the family, what a fucking timeline
[0:49:15] <wambiway> lol that would be great
[0:49:15] <jowi_time> oh thats good
[0:49:17] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> man we're getting all the best takes tonight this is gonna be a good stream
[0:49:19] <%wibbwobbler> if not forgiving means just moving on and nothing else, i agree
[0:49:20] <DarknessD42> Go even farther beyond!
[0:49:20] <StarlitStunner> Raised wrong on purpose, as a joke! bitterLOL bitterLOL
[0:49:25] <+ninja_galt> we live in a society...
[0:49:27] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt some of the worst kids I've worked with actually had loving, wonderful families. The kids were just a piece of shit.
[0:49:27] <+BlockingDisabled> If you don't have a time machine to make bullies beat up their past selves I guess they didn't hurt you that much
[0:49:29] <%Fooguwu> the parents didnt choose their own genes or environment either though
[0:49:30] <shotgang86> errand N U T
[0:49:31] <+oktavia_von> 9/10 the parents are the same as the kid
[0:49:31] <%W1nterTitan> pogonaLUL
[0:49:33] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[0:49:35] <RyuuAoi> Pat is on to something....
[0:49:37] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:49:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[0:49:37] <i_am_therydon> but the parents are too drunk/dead to apologize
[0:49:38] <$RealThiele> errant nut
[0:49:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> Go back in time and punch your dad's balls before you were conceived to prove you were wrong
[0:49:38] <dmtjinni> Would u kill baby Hitler?
[0:49:39] <+Canarchy10> kick your dad in the balls and play the odds to erase yourself or not
[0:49:40] <%Visorak6> Pat pls
[0:49:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT NO
[0:49:44] <%rekinom> The mother has to go back in time and swallow that nut instead @PatStaresAt
[0:49:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> What if the parents weren't in the picture? @PatStaresAt
[0:49:47] <+transporterthesequel> Goddamn
[0:49:49] <%Ynkubus_> PAT YES
[0:49:50] <faithless_zealot> Can anyone else feel all the pain Pat's reliving at this current moment?
[0:49:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> So basically you just want to inflict psychological torture
[0:49:56] <smiggyballs13> Sounds about right
[0:49:56] <%walternatorz> Pat is a forgiving soul.
[0:49:57] <ShichiNoBushi> This just in: Mysterious man shows up at an elementary school and viciously beat up a young bully saying "I'm yourself from the future and you are such a horrible kid that I came back to beat you up."
[0:49:58] <%Taisuru> PAt no
[0:50:00] <+Medvp> Agreed
[0:50:01] <RyuuAoi> Wouldn't we all smother baby Hitler?
[0:50:01] <%shurtal> Dat gief snore
[0:50:04] <%KishinGrek> Jesus Pat
[0:50:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Canarchy10 We had the same train of thought lol
[0:50:06] <DianaTheAscian> Return to nothing
[0:50:07] <jorniev> NO he doesnt care
[0:50:07] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> "Grudges are okay, beating children through time is valid redemption, beating the shit out of your parents is a valid substitute" @Patstaresat you're on a roll tonight
[0:50:07] <+ninja_galt> Bully Beatdown was a good show.
[0:50:09] <%AXL808> an apology from parents about how shit this kids are would really be a statement
[0:50:13] <jorniev> just go away
[0:50:24] <smiggyballs13> OMG BULLY BEATDOWN!
[0:50:25] <DianaTheAscian> He wants to be left alone
[0:50:26] <Tomschiii> now i have to think about the movie a silent voice
[0:50:29] <%coreyyotto> sooooo podcast topic right?
[0:50:29] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt But Pat, you're holding on to that anger towards them
[0:50:31] <Noogiez> you just dont exist anymore
[0:50:31] <smiggyballs13> I thought that was a fever dream
[0:50:31] <jorniev> MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CEASED TO BE A PERSON TO HIM
[0:50:32] <DusK_The_Stray> Wouldn't that just make the bullying worse?
[0:50:33] <dmtjinni> cancel culture
[0:50:35] <Madovir> PAT'S TALKING ABOUT TIME TRAVEL CHILD ABUSE, HE HAS TO BE SERIOUS, FOR SURE, FOR REAL
[0:50:36] <%whyskeywolfe> What if they could turn you into an immortal toilet?
[0:50:37] <RyuuAoi> I feel you. Once you cross my line, you no longer exist to me. You're legit a ghost. I won't acknowledge or look in your direction.
[0:50:38] <%bigbrothergannon> I feel you. just get those fucks the hell outta ya life
[0:50:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> Like when Michale Jordan used that aids needle
[0:50:40] <amonimis> pat just wants to live a peaceful life
[0:50:40] <%thedankestmeeme> pat quick your penis is out
[0:50:41] <%Broand> What about donating an organ
[0:50:43] <faithless_zealot> I mean, c'mon
[0:50:43] <%Daxalog> Pat: "No more mutants..."
[0:50:44] <+BigChiefBear> Lootta prior bullies in here loool
[0:50:45] <WinstonFromUndertale> Arnt u like 30 somethin now man?
[0:50:46] <%Visorak6> Indifference is not anger
[0:50:47] <%Monkeyweed21> this is all contigent on where the line is, cuz if we're talking about garden variety bullying that might be a little extreme
[0:50:47] <+ninja_galt> anger is a fuel source
[0:50:49] <jorniev> boooo
[0:50:54] <LVL1_Scumbag> I'll bet
[0:50:56] <wambiway> also these literally mean nothing to you so why would you care
[0:51:00] <%captainpodock> Yeah but they also made your life hell
[0:51:02] <%Mrbaconator> hell yeah I am
[0:51:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Once you've burned a bridge, you can never cross it. Might as well turn around and go home.
[0:51:05] <%logoth_> lol
[0:51:07] <RyuuAoi> Donating organs? Hell no! I'm taking them with me!
[0:51:09] <smiggyballs13> “Oh fuck off, I’m not angry”
[0:51:09] <OswaldTheDog> yeah no that’s bull
[0:51:10] <redrins> its called cutting people off your life for good
[0:51:11] <%Mrbaconator> i will hold this anger till i fucking die
[0:51:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NEW LORE
[0:51:12] <Profmcstevie> Rightful fury is awesoooome
[0:51:12] <%Maids4lyfe> @Tomschiii is that the anime with the deaf girl and the bully that picked on her?
[0:51:12] <shotgang86> I think that Pat has never been so much right in his life
[0:51:13] <@commanderclaw> Anger isn't hatred
[0:51:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> XF
[0:51:20] <+Kyma1020> Yeah that’s not anger, that’s indifference
[0:51:21] <+ninja_galt> but Pat what if it was hammer time
[0:51:22] <%Romuken> big sad
[0:51:23] <ToneBacas> how do you move on from that?
[0:51:24] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> the point is that being angry isn't healthy for YOU not that they deserve to be forgiven
[0:51:24] <thelonechris> They aren't evil, they're morally grey
[0:51:26] <lazypointer> no but healing tho
[0:51:28] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Well yeah, but, why did she hit you with the hammer?
[0:51:29] <%KineticZen> That's a pretty hyperbolic example
[0:51:31] <kinggum41> dog snoring
[0:51:32] <%ArchimerCXV> we aint a 2000s anime, you dont gotta forgive people for shit
[0:51:32] <%Grimlockfly> Thas right
[0:51:32] <missingangle> Fuck that
[0:51:32] <Badgerconda_> anger is healthy as fuck, the problem is that so many people don't understand how to be angry in a healthy way.
[0:51:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Guys you're trying to tell the man formerly known as AngriestPat that anger is bad.
[0:51:35] <%Ipsenscastle> you didn't listen to Yoda at all
[0:51:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> It took my sister a decade to fix things with me
[0:51:36] <Tomschiii> @Maids4lyfe it sure is
[0:51:36] <%Romuken> I've had to learn to let go of that shit cause I've always been told I was in the wrong.
[0:51:40] <%saadi90> Smoke weed and play vidya games
[0:51:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Pat has never been more right than right now
[0:51:42] <+Jaysky> I'm told to feel bad for my sister because she's had a hard life because she beat my fucking dad with his crutches
[0:51:42] <%Blank9> become emotionless and detached, it's more healthy
[0:51:42] <DianaTheAscian> NO
[0:51:47] <%Mrbaconator> family can fuck off the edge of my dong
[0:51:47] <+Medvp> this makes me think of Law Abiding Citizen movie
[0:51:50] <missingangle> "Forgive and forget." Or... eat my ass
[0:51:51] <Noogiez> would you forgive hitler?
[0:51:52] <%AXL808> they don't get how anger can actually be deserved, just don't let it extend beyond that person
[0:51:52] <%ScreamLord> Fuck family
[0:51:52] <WinstonFromUndertale> Says that’s nonsense but refuses to accept the idea of forgiveness, aight man
[0:51:54] <%Agami23> pat, are you not biased because you have a trash garbage brother?
[0:51:54] <%MidnightBurst12> fuck that
[0:51:54] <valriot> I havent talked to my dad in like 10 years, fuck that guy LUL
[0:51:55] <%Grimlockfly> Fuckem
[0:51:55] <+Kyoshikei> is that Zangeif snoring?
[0:51:55] <%Ipsenscastle> totally agree
[0:51:56] <Spartan3909> Sasuke.
[0:51:56] <%Alazull> I mean you can choose if you let it effect your life negatively, but you're dumb to just "let it go" when someone is abusive towards you
[0:51:58] <@SoFarFetched> its fine
[0:51:58] <%AzureGale> This isn't like TV where everyone can be redeemed
[0:51:59] <%Jackyplague45> Hey pat have to sleep night homie and amenlol
[0:52:00] <OswaldTheDog> You can be angry you just can’t do fucking stupid shit bc of your anger
[0:52:01] <%Deft_Thought> There's also a significant difference between being angry and letting that feeling control everything you do
[0:52:02] <Nordguy> my brother killed my pet rabbit fuck him
[0:52:02] <@SoFarFetched> and yeah Gief is snoring
[0:52:02] <%MidnightBurst12> trash is trash
[0:52:04] <smiggyballs13> You won’t change them by being angry though, Pat.
[0:52:05] <%Monkeyweed21> you should watch Hanebaddo and get super pissed off @PatStaresAt
[0:52:05] <brandt_connors> bada bing bada boom fuck your family
[0:52:06] <+Caidezes> Only Sith deal in absolutes. So become a Sith.
[0:52:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Like that episode where Wendy kicked Cartman's ass
[0:52:06] <jorniev> FUCK SASUKE
[0:52:06] <MahoganyWoods> Fuck Family. People need to earn the loyalty that mfers claim family is entitled to.
[0:52:07] <giogio346> oh yakuza daigo
[0:52:07] <RyuuAoi> SMOKE WEED AND DO SHROOMS. Here here
[0:52:07] <Madovir> the lesson here is "fuck them kids"
[0:52:11] <$RealThiele> i mean family has a responsibility to you its a 2 way street for those fuckers
[0:52:12] <%eyezehuhh> no, i needed that
[0:52:12] <thelonechris> Huey
[0:52:12] <+Canarchy10> true
[0:52:14] <%Deft_Thought> Folks have a right to be angry
[0:52:14] <bettysharkface> Pat out hear validating all the bridges I've burned, thank you my dude.
[0:52:16] <kikaliq2> hmmmmmmmmmmmm this is still about Daigo? 👀
[0:52:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But you did for a sec... YOU CIRED
[0:52:17] <KasGiD> Ooooh this is about Yakuza
[0:52:17] <jorniev> SASUKE WAS A TOXIC PIECE OF SHIT
[0:52:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> What if he sucked Majima's dick?
[0:52:18] <vangardia> he has a cool tattoo though
[0:52:18] <%KishinGrek> thanks Kishimoto
[0:52:19] <%captainpodock> For those not in the know what did Daigo do?
[0:52:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How about if he pulled the spiderman train saving scene?
[0:52:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> What did he even do in 4?
[0:52:21] <+Kyma1020> Exactly, cut the negative out
[0:52:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt What if Daigo goes back in time and stops you from crying over that letter?
[0:52:24] <shotgang86> I had a brother that was a piece of trash to me every oportunity that he had. Today I treat him with a 10 meter pole.
[0:52:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> OH BOY
[0:52:29] <%Deft_Thought> Just don't let that feeling spoil everything else you do
[0:52:29] <$StrawberryPantsu> IS IT

[0:52:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when Makoto lets a sex trafficker go scot free? @PatStaresAt
[0:52:54] <bob900000> yup
[0:53:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> I mean you MAGICALLY MAKE HER PARENTS GOOD PEOPLE so idk
[0:53:04] <%whyskeywolfe> Yakuza Zero: Just lead child sex traffickers WALK AWAY.
[0:53:07] <Virokwet> i mean, they did brainwashing
[0:53:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> Different Culture PAT
[0:53:14] <himbearbedtime> P5 pulls a lot of punches
[0:53:16] <%YakumoYomi> We changed their hearts, and they're sorry for pimping out their daughter. PROBLEM. SOLVED.
[0:53:17] <Draco_Renegade> Yea that game has a lot of problems with the writing.
[0:53:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh THAT. That was pretty fucky.
[0:53:20] <%weissguard> I mean, don't you force the parents in that to be better via change of heart?
[0:53:21] <Virokwet> shouldve solved the problem
[0:53:22] <%Alazull> It's still gross
[0:53:22] <%Taisuru> Did Royal make it any more tolerable?
[0:53:25] <$RealThiele> hey that sex trafficker learned his lessons LUL
[0:53:32] <%Agami23> persona 5 lets lots of sex criminals off scott free because you made them feel bad
[0:53:35] <cherrycottontail> This is why P4 is a better game
[0:53:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Do you get STYLE though?
[0:53:37] <Virokwet> @Taisuru no
[0:53:39] <%Blank9> royal did nothing
[0:53:41] <%Monkeyweed21> MAKOTO LET A SEX TRAFFICKER GO SCOT FREE
[0:53:44] <$StrawberryPantsu> @Taisuru HA NO!
[0:53:44] <%Arsenic_8> is the dog snoring?
[0:53:50] <%KineticZen> Boy you must hate Ichiban
[0:53:58] <missingangle> @Monkeyweed21 Since Pat was talking about P5 I did a double take here LUL
[0:54:05] <%Ynkubus_> Japanese media needs to swap a bunch of the forgiveness shit for humiliation
[0:54:05] <%machshop> absolutely
[0:54:08] <%Mrbaconator> ye im with that
[0:54:08] <thelonechris> LUL
[0:54:08] <cherrycottontail> At the crux of P5 is letting people go free to confess their sins and go to jail and FUCK THAT LET ME KILL EM
[0:54:13] <%AXL808> Uncle Iroh was right "Enlightenment is overrated"
[0:54:14] <%Visorak6> But the buddha only forgives twice
[0:54:14] <%Agami23> pat, i have talked to people who thing ging should be forgiven
[0:54:15] <+TopTieramisu> a life of pettiness isn't for everyone
[0:54:15] <+rdark_ksu> Pats a bad baaaad buddhist
[0:54:17] <%weissguard> @Monkeyweed21 Which character was this?
[0:54:18] <+oktavia_von> do i hear pupper snoring?
[0:54:19] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> as a buddhist, you have offended my religious beliefs and I will now ensure that you are cancelled. this is unforgivable
[0:54:20] <@commanderclaw> It's the belief that people only do bad things cause they're in pain and suffering, which is provably false
[0:54:24] <%yoshkosh20> My mom straight up committed identity theft on me. I’ll never talk to her again
[0:54:24] <RyuuAoi> @cherrycottontail Persona, Persona 2: IS, P2: EP

[0:54:30] <%Agami23> YEAH
[0:54:36] <%illtima> WHO?
[0:54:36] <Profmcstevie> Don't bring peace, remove misery
[0:54:38] <bob900000> who?
[0:54:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> P5 has a fundamental problem of absolving people who don't deserve it. I'm talking about YOU, Crow!
[0:54:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's all about whether you view punishment as a tool for vengeance or reform. Changing hearts reforms, but it doesn't satisfy vengeance.
[0:54:41] <+SoySocks> Ging as in Gon's dad?
[0:54:41] <+TopTieramisu> ging freecs? i mean his kid is also a sociopath
[0:54:42] <%baka_sugoi> im a buddist and i believe in karma

[0:55:16] <jowi_time> fuck Ging!
[0:55:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @weissguard the "boyfriend" of Makoto's friend is a sex trafficker that gets away free
[0:55:17] <missingangle> Redemption can be a really shitty story arc if done wrong

[0:58:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Monkeyweed21 The club owner guy? Yeah they should've called the cops on his ass
[0:58:04] <%Taisuru> You gonna do the co-op missions?
[0:58:05] <shotgang86> I still have to do another run on Bayo 2
[0:58:10] <%weissguard> @GarbageQueenEllie P4AU confirms that Dojima's been visiting Adachi in jail, but that's as far as it goes, I think.
[0:58:14] <%ScreamLord> Did you?
[0:58:14] <$RealThiele> platinum knew ppl want weapons not dumb pearls
[0:58:16] <%0rond> chapter 10 is super long and super confusing
[0:58:20] <@SoFarFetched> remember you went back to some levels to do some shit
[0:58:36] <+TheotherKristian> I want to beat Rodin in both the games before 3
[0:58:51] <%0rond> it baffled me when last stream your "one more" was chapter 10, since it's absurdly long and complex to get everything
[0:58:51] <RyuuAoi> Pat, DO THE SECRETS NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.
[0:58:54] <koffeemancer> Last weapon you just get for beating the boss
[0:59:04] <%weissguard> Also, I think the dude Monkeyweed keeps mentioning is Tsukasa? A host that Makoto's "friend" dates, and gets the girls to whore themselves out so he can make bank off them.
[0:59:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> @weissguard I'd visit him in jail. Visit him to hear how many salads he's tossed.
[0:59:27] <Laecerelius> Chainsaws!
[0:59:28] <%Blank9> best weapon
[0:59:32] <%Ynkubus_> CHAINSWORDS
[0:59:34] <+SoySocks> chainsaws HAWT
[0:59:38] <%snackcanary> Yeah. I still have stuff to get in the game. And I've played this thing several times over.

[0:59:42] <notsoy> twin chainswords? shout out warhammer
[0:59:42] <Maids4lyfe> isn't Rohan Lee from Walking Dead?
[0:59:43] <%weissguard> Only reason it's even remotely remembered is cause Makoto slapped the shit out of him, I think? It's been a while.
[0:59:45] <%whyskeywolfe> Chain Wasanasaw
[0:59:45] <%Alazull> With a chainsaw, skin you ass raw
[0:59:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @weissguard yep, he doesn't even get a change of heart, he just moves on to another girl
[0:59:46] <DrkJP520> Yo Pat, what colour temperature do you have set on your TV? What would you say is optimal for gaming?

[1:00:49] <%weissguard> @GarbageQueenEllie I mean, for what it's worth, the Investigation Team doesn't forgive him when he shows up. They're suspicious of him right up until the climax of the story, where Yu and Adachi team up to beat the boss.

[1:02:36] <thelonechris> Chainsawman
[1:02:38] <%Daxalog> Those platinum chainsaws
[1:02:45] <%ConLin_Arts_> doesn't hammer just melt healthbars?
[1:02:56] <%Monkeyweed21> the chainsaws replace the ice skates from 1
[1:02:59] <+Cobaltor_252> SHE SKATES WITH THEM DJKIWQ
[1:03:04] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> she SUCC
[1:03:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Bayonetta: "Time to do a little gardening." *revs chainsaw*
[1:03:07] <penitentpendant> All fear the Command Grab
[1:03:07] <%weissguard> @GarbageQueenEllie I mean, it's also a canon entry. And it's still weird, cause Adachi more or less realized that he was wrong, and is slowly coming around to the importance of bonds and stuff. Cause Dojima didn't give up on him.
[1:03:07] <+Gespens> Is Alraune just a Vergil?
[1:03:14] <jorniev> this is the whip from 1?
[1:03:14] <valriot> I love that her idle walk is a "That Bitch" STRUT
[1:03:22] <TioXyco> Alraune is Geese! She can Raising Storm!
[1:03:36] <smiggyballs13> Play the video game balding overweight older man!
[1:03:45] <%coreyyotto> good
[1:03:51] <+Dova573> man this fight reminds me how much I enjoy bayo 2 more than 1
[1:03:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Much like Dark Souls 2
[1:03:59] <%Monkeyweed21> good those are where Platinum shines
[1:04:01] <missingangle> it's a nice change of pace
[1:04:04] <%Blackmage9999> Blackmage9999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:04:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> @weissguard pffffft. Well, at least he actually goes to prison. Unlike in 5.
[1:04:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> and like KH2
[1:04:11] <valriot> Aww man i forgot the weapon you get here, its so fucking good
[1:04:24] <RyuuAoi> Rewatching Pat play I'm like how da fuq did I beat this? Ha
[1:04:27] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> this fight really makes me enjoy the fact that this game is very superior to its predecessor
[1:04:31] <valriot> Because she does
[1:04:34] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Very fitting for Alraune
[1:05:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> I actually don't really like Alraune
[1:05:02] <Tuna_Can_0> the fuckin headbutt calebKek
[1:05:08] <Tuna_Can_0> I forgot about that
[1:05:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> I really hope Bayo 3 is better than DMC3,but I aint holding my breath...
[1:05:10] <Laecerelius> Yeah not bad
[1:05:10] <%Monkeyweed21> is it ever explained how she got Jeanne's Soul and not Madama Styx
[1:05:12] <DianaTheAscian> that was kinda easy
[1:05:15] <+Dova573> I dont give a fuck umbran climax is busted, is so damn fun
[1:05:16] <smiggyballs13> Guys should I play some SmashU or keep playing Nioh 2? I need an answer!
[1:05:18] <penitentpendant> It's always tough if you stop before a boss
[1:05:21] <jorniev> yeah good job
[1:05:31] <%arcielardor> oh shit rita repulsa!
[1:05:32] <Laecerelius> OH NOOOOOO!!
[1:05:40] <%TimetodiveLTX> best monster girl

[1:05:48] <+TopTieramisu> my frisbee waifu
[1:05:49] <RyuuAoi> Well that norm though. Get stumped, take a day off, return, and you crush it.
[1:05:49] <Laecerelius> Gotta fight this big ol' bitch!
[1:05:52] <2Bs_USB_port> faster and stronger too?
[1:05:52] <+PkSilent01> vore?
[1:05:53] <%weissguard> @GarbageQueenEllie I still like it more than Persona 5's stuff, tbh. Cause most fixes to problems in P5 don't feel like they're going to work/last. Hell, Adachi walks himself back to prison in time so that he's not reported to jailbreak.
[1:05:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Punch her in the FACE
[1:05:54] <missingangle> My wife!
[1:05:57] <DrkJP520> She was hiding Jeanne under her dress
[1:05:59] <+Dova573> Time fore Bayo to call her Megazord

[1:15:29] <%Grimlockfly> CLIMAX HORSE

[1:16:14] <%Dakuu75> So how much... horse-power... does this thing have?
[1:16:15] <%0rond> there's more than one of each demon, at the start of hell there are like 10 scolopendra

[1:16:40] <rufus2k2> or was there one?
[1:16:40] <$StrawberryPantsu> it's the best boss in the game
[1:16:42] <smiggyballs13> JUST WHAT LIES AHEAD ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
[1:16:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> Whatever that thing is called
[1:16:48] <%twistedj3ster> is the bit-rate dying for anyone else or am I the dreaded one guy?

[1:17:32] <DrkJP520> You're actually riding along Dalamadur
[1:17:33] <+SoySocks> nicely done
[1:17:39] <samazam94> youre racing on a bunch of dead Scolopendras
[1:17:40] <Vyneci> Wait what? A minigame section that doesn't overstay its welcome? Madness!
[1:17:41] <%baka_sugoi> P E R F E C T
[1:17:45] <bettysharkface> I don't think this is how horses work
[1:17:47] <+ninja_galt> whole lot of horsing around, I bet you feel hot to trot

[1:18:09] <%0rond> time for the not as awesome vergil 3
[1:18:16] <%RaziWraith> Don't have to mash your fingers off to get a good ranking LUL
[1:18:18] <smiggyballs13> Horse ain’t lettin that go down

[1:18:35] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeet the child

[1:18:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> Horse stole baby
[1:18:57] <%alyss988> omg
[1:18:59] <smiggyballs13> Bye bye baby
[1:18:59] <penitentpendant> Hmm. I wonder how a Lumen character would play in 3? Would 'Lumen Time' just be physically caging the monster you dodged?
[1:19:08] <%AzureGale> Doog and kitteh
[1:19:15] <cloakofashes> Bayo, get your answers, then let him murder the child. Geez.
[1:19:18] <DrkJP520> Diplomacy has failed! Engaging Unlimited Form!
[1:19:18] <PrinceOfEden> You'd think Bayonetta would ask the horse to stop.
[1:19:19] <+Dova573> oh hai Raiden
[1:19:20] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> FUCK
[1:19:21] <%Bt_Robot> WHERE'S DENKOMARU WHEN YOU NEED HIM?
[1:19:22] <Idon__> She said it... AGAIN
[1:19:23] <HairballCT> see i told you
[1:19:25] <jorniev> AGAIN
[1:19:26] <DianaTheAscian> HSE SAID IT

[1:19:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> yeah lol
[1:19:34] <RyuuAoi> Wow he's sexy
[1:19:35] <%baka_sugoi> lool
[1:19:35] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Platinum can not help themselves
[1:19:37] <DrkJP520> I think she does at this point
[1:19:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AMNESIA
[1:19:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Man Crispin Freeman's voice is so cool
[1:19:43] <%Grimlockfly> That guuuuy
[1:19:43] <jfp4life> Baldur was kinda pasty though
[1:19:43] <RyuuAoi> DADDY!?
[1:19:43] <%dasmause> cause she killed him
[1:19:44] <%whyskeywolfe> She only met Balder once, for 5 minutes.
[1:19:44] <Idon__> He even has the stupid monocle hggLul
[1:19:45] <%Maids4lyfe> Why would she care?
[1:19:46] <smiggyballs13> What is this? Animal Farm?
[1:19:47] <%Bt_Robot> IT'S THE MONOCLE
[1:19:47] <Lixagon> Maybe they all look like that
[1:19:49] <TheAntiNihilist> it doesn't look like him...
[1:19:52] <Vyneci> She does by now
[1:19:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> platinum CAN help themselves
[1:19:55] <%ssjklyco> Amnesia again
[1:19:56] <%ConLin_Arts_> BALDER
[1:19:57] <%baka_sugoi> young
[1:19:57] <+TopTieramisu> peacock wings
[1:19:59] <jorniev> BALDER 3?
[1:19:59] <penitentpendant> "Wait, this music sounds familiar..."
[1:19:59] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:19:59] <Profmcstevie> "Mysterious Golden Stranger"
[1:20:00] <anuchallengertwitch> I think she did when she was shown the flashback. she just doesn't say it to him
[1:20:01] <DrkJP520> She does know
[1:20:02] <rufus2k2> Bayonetta don't really care
[1:20:02] <%0rond> the lumen sage is playable in multiplayer, it works the same as witch time basically, though technically they move very fast instead of the world moving slowly. it's also black and whtie
[1:20:02] <%alyss988> sipsipGasm
[1:20:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> 4/20 blaze it
[1:20:04] <%weissguard> YEYEYE THIS MUSIC
[1:20:06] <%Grimlockfly> Daddy gonna daddy
[1:20:07] <%Dakuu75> why are the Lumen Sages such pricks?
[1:20:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> the cutscene just told her
[1:20:10] <%Taisuru> She barely actually MET balder
[1:20:12] <%AXL808> I enjoyed this fight but the color palette made it difficult to fight him on higher difficulties
[1:20:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He talks a lot less "MMMMMEYYEEESS"
[1:20:14] <Saltmeisterr> BEEG FEATHERS
[1:20:17] <Laecerelius> Gotta fight your dad again, Bayo
[1:20:18] <OswaldTheDog> it’s time to talk about the fact that Bayonetta is not very smart
[1:20:20] <Stipli> you know he is serious since he has a monocle LUL
[1:20:24] <+Kyma1020> She knows but doesn’t want to talk about it
[1:20:26] <rufus2k2> CHAINSAW MAAM
[1:20:30] <devanmuse> Didn't she figure out it was him after the mask broke to show his eye?
[1:20:38] <smiggyballs13> This guy belongs in Kingdom Hearts.
[1:20:49] <RyuuAoi> Idk, Pat....
[1:20:54] <%0rond> this is cooler than bayo 1 balder, but not quite as cool as balder 2 from this game
[1:21:06] <penitentpendant> If nothing else, I'd assume a Lumen Player Character would have better Stingers than an Umbran Character
[1:21:15] <rufus2k2> BTW @PatStaresAt Chainsaw Man ended so you can read it all in one go now if you want.
[1:21:19] <%cherubs_anonymous> Yup
[1:21:20] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeye
[1:21:21] <%LaughingCatt> yeah
[1:21:21] <penitentpendant> It's his music from the first game
[1:21:21] <Vyneci> It is
[1:21:24] <bettysharkface> I'm so confused
[1:21:24] <Tuna_Can_0> yes
[1:21:24] <%Buzzard42> this is probably my favorite fight in the series
[1:21:25] <%Blank9> yeah
[1:21:27] <samazam94> yep
[1:21:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> yeah
[1:21:30] <%AXL808> having this be Balder's voice does explain why his voice was different in the movie
[1:21:31] <anuchallengertwitch> The only reason I've never played Bayonetta is because I'm self conscious about not making rank. And the only reason I worry about rank is because I'm NOT GOOD at doing no damage
[1:21:32] <%Blank9> You May Call Me Father
[1:21:34] <DrkJP520> Hold an attack button with alraune during witch time
[1:21:35] <%AXL808> yeah, same music
[1:21:40] <%TimetodiveLTX> the horse music was from the first game too
[1:21:43] <%LaughingCatt> Rodin also has this theme in his bonus battle
[1:21:56] <OswaldTheDog> yeah bayo one and two share a lot of music
[1:22:05] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @rufus2k2 Only Part 1 ended, it's still continuing, just not in the weekly Shonen Jump anymore.
[1:22:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> using the same music to conjure up memories of the first game helps the player fully appreciate how this game is actually at least 10x better
[1:22:22] <RyuuAoi> Red Hot Shot on lock?
[1:22:24] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt did you see that Jeanne and Rodin have been added to Wonderful 101?
[1:22:25] <rufus2k2> @GrandmasterBFunk shhh he doesn't need to know that
[1:22:26] <%TimetodiveLTX> @DickieWoodsmall_279 shut up you're wrong
[1:22:30] <$StrawberryPantsu> tfw Transformers is the only one of these "Character Action" games to play with the Idea of a Grappler
[1:22:34] <%RaziWraith> they stopped dmg during the zoom out. LUL
[1:22:42] <HairballCT> almost done (for)
[1:22:42] <smiggyballs13> Can anyone tell me why I’m slightly behind all of you guys?
[1:22:51] <anuchallengertwitch> @StrawberryPantsu Grimlock was badass in that game

[1:26:48] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Balder's big mad

[1:29:15] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> this game does vigrid better than bayo 1, a common theme of bayo 2
[1:29:21] <%Morbidmort> @StrawberryPantsu Kink shaming
[1:29:22] <@SoFarFetched> Im kinda surprised you didnt do KOTOR 2 today to show the new audio setups

[1:31:27] <smiggyballs13> I hope they don’t change the intermission, I like this animation
[1:31:29] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Did Zangief deflect the piss with his muscles

[1:32:35] <smiggyballs13> We know this
[1:32:39] <%RaziWraith> Yes, that is what is wrong with this depiction clearly LUL
[1:32:40] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Maaan, I can't believe how much fucking, like, more 2 has in terms of fights and locations and enemies
[1:32:40] <RyuuAoi> Wha happun? Did he rage quit?
[1:32:43] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> why does he always have a chin strap in the art for this channel and the old one?
[1:32:54] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I hope they keep that level of quantity up for 3
[1:32:54] <%AzureGale> @RyuuAoi Bathroom breal
[1:33:20] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> did he EVER have a chin strap?
[1:33:40] <RyuuAoi> @dickiewoodsmall_279 On his dick, yes
[1:33:53] <smiggyballs13> Do you know how nice my anime self’s jawline would be? It would be so nice
[1:33:55] <%RaziWraith> @DickieWoodsmall_279 The chin strap is there is you look deep in his anime soul. KappaHD
[1:34:12] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> It's cool

[1:36:08] <%zeroarturia> thesph1JillGOODJOB Hi Suzi
[1:36:20] <%RaziWraith> freakin chainsaw skates LUL
[1:36:32] <smiggyballs13> Ok I have another question, should I smoke a little bit of weed? Or commit sudoku?
[1:36:35] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt the charge is timing based by the way, negative edge for an extra hit
[1:36:35] <RyuuAoi> Give Bayo 3 to Capcom.
[1:36:44] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @TheSphereHunter Binyot name corruptions are always good, we need to do it to more streamers LUL
[1:36:45] <%TimetodiveLTX> weed
[1:36:49] <RyuuAoi> @smiggyballs13 GET SMOKED
[1:36:53] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @smiggyballs13 inhale keyboard cleaner and jerk off
[1:37:00] <%Taisuru> SO is your stream but we don't unequip YOU!

[1:37:25] <smiggyballs13> @dickiewoodsmall_279 Inhale my gamer gear keyboard cleanser instead? Well ok!
[1:37:40] <ChungusQuest> it's da angles
[1:37:47] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> yeah it's like chokejerking without as much risk
[1:37:49] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @anuchallengertwitch They're not, Loki sent Bayo and Balder back in time
[1:37:55] <+Cobaltor_252> is this the SAME secret verse from Bayo 1?
[1:38:01] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt the charge is timing based by the way, negative edge for an extra hit
[1:38:09] <koffeemancer> Ye
[1:38:12] <%GarbageNirvana> @anuchalngertwitch Metaphysics are weird like thatl
[1:38:15] <smiggyballs13> But we all know the choke jerk is to DIE FOR! Ehh? Ehhhhh?
[1:38:22] <redrins> when the chainsaws turn red iirc
[1:38:27] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Da birb
[1:38:32] <anuchallengertwitch> @A_CD_By_Thomas I meant Rodin's shop. the portal to it is somehow in the past
[1:38:34] <%logoth_> Why no Umbran Cow
[1:38:38] <NitronStreams> BURDIE
[1:38:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Wow that message got fucked up
[1:38:57] <%weissguard> Rodin's been at his business for a while, dude.
[1:38:58] <%0rond> the muspelheim definitely wasn't here in bayo 1 lmao
[1:38:59] <%Bt_Robot> Bird up!
[1:38:59] <%TimetodiveLTX> i feel like at least a decade has to pass before you make a 1:1 remake like this
[1:39:12] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @anuchallengertwitch Oh LUL Rodin has his ways, I guess.
[1:39:18] <thelonechris> That's a lotta damage
[1:39:23] <%great_tj> deleted
[1:39:23] <RyuuAoi> MELTED
[1:39:24] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> I bet darth vader could chokejerk himself without the risk. if he passed out it would release the pressure on his neck immediately. too bad his penis is all fucked up
[1:39:27] <%baronblank> the song hadn't even started yet lol
[1:39:32] <%GarbageNirvana> It has been about a decade tho
[1:39:34] <+Gespens> oh, the bayo 1 barrier break animation
[1:39:35] <%Daxalog> platinum sure does love chainsaw with glowing orange saws
[1:39:37] <redrins> cut content Kappa
[1:39:38] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Maybe it totally wasn't
[1:39:42] <anuchallengertwitch> @A_CD_By_Thomas He was top god in heaven for a while
[1:39:44] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool you fight Bayo 1 angels in this level
[1:39:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> Maybe cause it was completed in the past it faded in Bayo 1
[1:39:49] <smiggyballs13> “Of course! The solution was Flex Tape!”
[1:39:51] <ToneBacas> @DickieWoodsmall_279 yes

[1:41:15] <anuchallengertwitch> inb4 they reveal in the 3rd game that Bayonetta is literally her own mom

[1:42:35] <anuchallengertwitch> Wait why SPOIILERS? The flashback earlier clearly showed who the lumen sage and witch where
[1:42:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> i like this boss
[1:42:39] <%Daxalog> I sure hope this dosnt ruin the time stream or something
[1:42:40] <Profmcstevie> Does she see the Umbran Climax and go "holy shit what the fuck"
[1:43:03] <penitentpendant> "That's my girl."
[1:43:06] <%ConLin_Arts_> Is that Fortitudo? looks a bit glam-ed up
[1:43:12] <%bardocckk> What’s up party ppl
[1:43:25] <%0rond> the way to scrub through high difficulty in this game is literally the loadout pat is using right now, slam them with the whip than tear into them with the saw
[1:43:47] <%DEETRz> that mashing speed jesus
[1:43:48] <smiggyballs13> Omg I’m such a newbie I didn’t know I could get rid of the language censors
[1:43:54] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @PatStaresAt With the Switch rerelease out would you be interested in streaming Wonderful 101 at some point?
[1:43:58] <smiggyballs13> Jesus I thought twitch just lost all its balls
[1:43:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Split screen.
[1:43:59] <%TimetodiveLTX> ok thats badass
[1:44:01] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpOmg woolieSHOOK PogChamp
[1:44:06] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @0rond are you saying pat doesn't actually style in a character action game
[1:44:21] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> More verse references
[1:44:21] <%AXL808> i still think Sapiantia is the most dickish of them though
[1:44:22] <%TimetodiveLTX> """efficiency meter"""
[1:44:23] <%GarbageNirvana> So I was in and out a bit, are those chainsaws what Alraune became
[1:44:23] <%Taisuru> Bark Bark I'm a Cat
[1:44:25] <anuchallengertwitch> real talk, Bayonetta could probably kick Sephiroth's ass
[1:44:39] <%Taisuru> @GarbageNirvana No, she became whips
[1:44:43] <%Bt_Robot> AR AR i'm an armin!
[1:44:46] <smiggyballs13> Real talk we all saw that death match between Dante and Bayo
[1:44:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah
[1:45:00] <+Jttg> Oh shit Chainsaw Man has a game already???
[1:45:03] <%baka_sugoi> what dose cat sound like?
[1:45:04] <+Delenay> so is madame butterfly helping from the past or bayos present?
[1:45:13] <%king_wragles> This sequence is cool and all Pat, but what if there was mecha?
[1:45:26] <%0rond> the flow of time is convoluted in vigrid
[1:45:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I should really finish this game
[1:45:28] <Vyneci> BTW, if you keep taunting the wall, Rosa just keeps attacking it by herself LUL
[1:45:34] <penitentpendant> Man that one bridge keeps getting blown up and rebuilt
[1:45:38] <%logoth_> Muutherrrrr
[1:45:41] <Vyneci> THIS is new stuff
[1:45:50] <anuchallengertwitch> I wonder if there where ever male umbrans
[1:45:59] <%Daxalog> So is using Witch Time and all the good abilities just High level stuff? Seems like normal Umbran Witches just get some guns
[1:46:02] <smiggyballs13> Man fuck that door’s shit up
[1:46:04] <%0rond> this is so cool because toy never actually went through that door in 1, you got close and than the bridge collapsed
[1:46:06] <%Monkeyweed21> these are the lava caves from 1 right?
[1:46:17] <%LaughingCatt> Bayonetta is Mummy not Mutherr. the difference is that she can fuck
[1:46:22] <thelonechris> jaboodyDeeDee
[1:46:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this the lava cave from 1?
[1:46:29] <shotgang86> B A R K

[1:46:47] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Bork with me if your my dogs
[1:46:48] <%GarbageNirvana> If there were never male umbras then who would witches bone to get more witches
[1:46:49] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> has bayo ever actually had sex though?
[1:46:51] <anuchallengertwitch> @Maids4lyfe Ah. Thanks
[1:46:51] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a chest

[1:47:03] <%Morbidmort> I LOVE IT
[1:47:04] <%0rond> it super is it's the best
[1:47:04] <Saltmeisterr> NYOOOMM
[1:47:15] <%Maids4lyfe> probably
[1:47:15] <NitronStreams> you missed all the chests
[1:47:18] <%0rond> remember bayo rode on chainsaws before dante
[1:47:22] <Sunstalker> Nah, Bionicle does that too, chainsaw skates are rad
[1:47:27] <thelonechris> Remember when Iron Man had rollerskates? That was the dumbest shit
[1:47:31] <anuchallengertwitch> @DickieWoodsmall_279 part of me thinks Bayonetta is aesexual and just does all the sexy stuff just to fuck with people
[1:47:39] <jorniev> THESE GUYS
[1:48:15] <smiggyballs13> Btw I know none of you care but I’ve lost 50 pounds during the COVIDs
[1:48:16] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt you can store a max charge while using panther within and start every battle with it
[1:48:28] <%Daxalog> 99 baked geckos
[1:48:29] <%AXL808> the real challenge is Gracious & Glorious
[1:48:41] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @anuchallengertwitch weren't the umbran witches literally taught that sex is bad? do they have their own daughters or make more witches jedi style?
[1:48:43] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[1:48:44] <Dave_VD> Do the chainsaw rollerblades functionally do anything, or is it just a different animation?
[1:49:04] <%baka_sugoi> BONK
[1:49:06] <+Dova573> oh man I tottally ignored the hammer weapon when i played this game
[1:49:10] <%logoth_> Is she praising you while you fight?
[1:49:12] <Byr0nX> Big baby faces golem
[1:49:17] <%0rond> @Dave_VD you move faster and do very little damage
[1:49:20] <+Dova573> I was like this is slow, thats dumb
[1:49:29] <%alyss988> doggo
[1:49:33] <+oktavia_von> @smiggyballs13 nice barrLove
[1:49:48] <Dave_VD> @0rond thats rad, thanks
[1:49:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I'm not 100% on Bayonetta lore as I am on other series'. If that is the case, then it would make even more sense for Bayo to be aesexual.
[1:50:03] <smiggyballs13> I love warhammers in every game. Skyrim, Nioh, dark souls, bloodborne
[1:50:05] <%Taisuru> Gief is upset you haven't unlocked Rodan yet
[1:50:07] <+Cobaltor_252> oh no Pat's worst enemy a wall of lava

[1:50:52] <Byr0nX> "on the rocks!!?"
[1:50:52] <penitentpendant> The convenience of building your secret base on top of lava
[1:50:58] <dan_g_v> wait, it's still not midnight
[1:50:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @DickieWoodsmall_279 but then again, that didn't stop Rosa and Balder from doing it

[2:01:09] <%Taisuru> Punch his butt
[2:01:21] <OswaldTheDog> He holding onto his anger
[2:01:50] <%0rond> you can slam basically EVERYTHING in witch time
[2:02:04] <$RealThiele> ass pounded

[2:03:11] <ShichiNoBushi> I thought they were over.
[2:03:23] <+TopTieramisu> metal gear
[2:03:23] <%BinaryFireball> so hows the story in bayo2?
[2:03:24] <%Morbidmort> Metal Gear?
[2:03:26] <%0rond> you can slam basically EVERYTHING in witch time, including bosses iirc, and 2 at once since you have 2 whips @PatStaresAt
[2:03:26] <@Mechz71> magitek

[2:03:42] <+Cobaltor_252> yeyeyeye
[2:03:42] <%Mendin> Moon Mecha
[2:03:44] <%logoth_> Why do angels have mech warriors
[2:03:44] <%Plesin> Ah yes, the farming chapter
[2:03:44] <$RealThiele> soken?
[2:03:45] <OswaldTheDog> mecha time
[2:03:47] <allyalice> Row Row Fight The Angels
[2:03:48] <+TheotherKristian> Now this is the Halo farming level
[2:03:49] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> LUNA LAGANN

[2:04:07] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt man Main Scenario Roulette looks nuts
[2:04:09] <+ChaosAethr> Metal Gear Umbra

[2:04:15] <%ElkRiverDog> Cid liked that
[2:04:17] <%Mendin> Get in the robot, Cereza
[2:04:22] <+oktavia_von> cant be as bad as the robots in pso2
[2:04:23] <%Bt_Robot> RICHAAARD!
[2:04:33] <$RealThiele> Enzo lying on the bed
[2:04:38] <%SGrim> Why do the Umbran Witches have massive robots?
[2:04:39] <DrkJP520> Do stinger kicks
[2:04:42] <allyalice> yeah the robot works better as an accessory imo, lets you integrate it more into your kit
[2:04:47] <%Daxalog> I really like the design of these
[2:04:47] <%super_ej8> MICHAEL!
[2:04:54] <ygtidal> it looks like ghimlyt dark
[2:04:58] <%BioHunter> they didnt
[2:04:59] <%Daxalog> Well there was only 1 and not 2
[2:05:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> Lumen sags cheated
[2:05:03] <%BioHunter> the humans killed em
[2:05:06] <cloakofashes> They have massive robots because they have massive robots.
[2:05:07] <%LaughingCatt> They couldnt defeat the Backstory curse
[2:05:08] <%BinaryFireball> they got distracted by sex
[2:05:10] <%megaman_sentinel> magic?
[2:05:10] <+Delenay> they were 1 witch short before...?
[2:05:12] <%baronblank> I guess all of them besides these 2 sucked
[2:05:13] <devanmuse> They only had two of those robots?
[2:05:14] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> There's a lotta jobbers, so
[2:05:14] <Vyneci> Maybe the angels had BIGGER robots?
[2:05:15] <+oktavia_von> they didn't have plot armor
[2:05:16] <%Bt_Robot> TIME TRAVEL CAN BE FUCKY
[2:05:17] <penitentpendant> Dynasty Warriors logic: You have a few really good hero units, but your mooks are terrible
[2:05:19] <+TopTieramisu> they ran out of heels
[2:05:19] <Profmcstevie> Because you're 2 protagonists right now not the 1
[2:05:20] <+TheotherKristian> Maybe they only had like five members, also the humans didn't like them
[2:05:22] <xxshadowxx416> all the not main character are bad
[2:05:23] <DianaTheAscian> well it seems theres not a lot of them
[2:05:26] <%wibbwobbler> 2 many angles
[2:05:27] <ammobasket> Theeeeeese witches are better?
[2:05:28] <%Monkeyweed21> did witches invent guns?
[2:05:30] <%AXL808> I think part of it's because the angels seem to have an infinite supply to throw at the witches
[2:05:32] <thelonechris> They went back to their home planet but died on the way there
[2:05:33] <%BioHunter> pretty sure the lumens lost
[2:05:35] <DrkJP520> In Bayo3 it will be revealed that the Angels had Jesus on their side.
[2:05:39] <%0rond> I mean they didn't really lose, both the witches and sages are extinct
[2:05:40] <OswaldTheDog> torches and pitchforks can really take down a mecha yknow
[2:05:45] <%Bt_Robot> MAYBE THEY DID LOSE, BUT THEN BAYO 2 CAME I AND WON IT FOR THEM
[2:05:49] <+BlockingDisabled> the umbrage WON
[2:05:49] <%JD_Lars> This is where I darned halos on WiiU.
[2:05:51] <+skylerpilot> Magic suit is probably powered by the witches magic and you're Bayo, so you JUICE IT
[2:05:52] <%MechArch> jeez melted
[2:05:54] <%JD_Lars> Farmed*
[2:06:02] <%zeroarturia> They did won but it was the witch hunts that ended most of them
[2:06:04] <%0rond> technically at the start of bayo 1 there is 1 lumen and 2 umbran so i'd say they won
[2:06:12] <%Taisuru> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:06:30] <%JD_Lars> Midas Talisman and hold that gun button. Easy halos.
[2:06:32] <dan_g_v> deaded
[2:06:32] <%alyss988> ded
[2:06:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bring the entire mecha

[2:08:12] <%Taisuru> True but Bayo is fantastic too
[2:08:14] <DianaTheAscian> its the feathers
[2:08:15] <%AXL808> i loved playing as Balder in the multiplayer
[2:08:19] <%AkronymCLT> The mask is cooler the monocle is not
[2:08:19] <Dave_VD> Isn't he playable?
[2:08:21] <%arancet> boya2 asthetic is stronger, but bayo1 is kinda weak
[2:08:22] <allyalice> even in 1 baldur had that thing where he goes through all of your demons and its Rad As Fuck
[2:08:26] <%Bt_Robot> YEAH, TRY TELLING THAT TO WOOLIE
[2:08:26] <anuchallengertwitch> Am I the only one who doesn't like that Musphelhiems are mandatory for rank?
[2:08:28] <thelonechris> I always dig the villains looking like the good guys
[2:08:41] <%RaziWraith> that's definitely not gonna happen LUL
[2:08:45] <%Taisuru> You know you can play as Baldur in this right?
[2:08:50] <Vyneci> He was supposed to be playable in the story too FeelsBadMan
[2:08:51] <therefortomorrow> I hope we just get a Bayo 3 trailer this yera
[2:08:54] <%0rond> all the lumens died though there's literally no one left
[2:08:59] <anuchallengertwitch> only in tag climax
[2:09:01] <$RealThiele> cereza steals the lumen macguffin
[2:09:01] <%BioHunter> how many people would be pissed if u didnt play as bayo in 3?
[2:09:06] <%Bt_Robot> BAYO 2 HAS SHORT HAIR PAT, S H O R T H A I R
[2:09:07] <%weissguard> I feel that. Despite Lumen Sages not dealing with Space, just time in a different way. But I feel that.
[2:09:09] <%AXL808> you get to use his boss moveset and it's great
[2:09:09] <Idon__> Similarly, I wish we could've played as Credo in DMC4.
[2:09:11] <%ConLin_Arts_> What if it dabbles in alternate realities and you play as a Lumen Bayonetta
[2:09:37] <%GarbageNirvana> But does she have a little hat
[2:09:37] <DrkJP520> Best music
[2:09:38] <penitentpendant> Lumen Witches vs Umbran Sages
[2:09:38] <Idon__> Parallel worlds AND time travel? Oh god
[2:09:42] <xxshadowxx416> @therefortomorrow haha bayo 3 like evangelion
[2:09:51] <+TheotherKristian> Just Devil may cry, bayonetta 3. 1/2 with bayo, 1/2 someone else
[2:09:53] <DianaTheAscian> this one seems smaller
[2:09:57] <%Emperor_Machinus> Also out of water where he is weaker
[2:10:07] <%kyh9> I wager Bayo 3 will either be a prequel to Bayo 1 or some sort of dimensional shit where the genders for witches and sages are reversed and Bayo has the angelic aesthetic
[2:10:09] <%0rond> bayonetta 3.33 you can (not) ask your mom
[2:10:10] <anuchallengertwitch> @ConLin_Arts_ inb4 the final boss of bayo 3 is evil dimension hopping Bayonetta
[2:10:24] <$RealThiele> this is the best armored core game we will see for awhile :(
[2:10:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[2:10:32] <%0rond> this is sapientia
[2:10:38] <DrkJP520> Was this the level that was supposed to be the great farming spot?
[2:10:38] <%0rond> justice is the tentacle mosnter
[2:10:39] <%AXL808> Iustitia is justice
[2:10:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Sapientia
[2:10:47] <allyalice> "justice" pats a Fake Fan
[2:10:51] <SCIENCE_25> So long gay bowsser
[2:10:54] <%Visorak6> YEET
[2:10:56] <dan_g_v> Lusty?
[2:11:03] <%alyss988> LUL
[2:11:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> Shaggy?
[2:11:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Independence Dangel
[2:11:22] <Idon__> Why'd you turn into shaggy
[2:11:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> Zoinks Scoob
[2:11:25] <$RealThiele> ruh roh
[2:11:25] <dan_g_v> reminded of Azura's wrath just now
[2:11:26] <%0rond> this part's weird
[2:11:27] <%RetroCop87> what is this Super Sonic shit?
[2:11:36] <penitentpendant> I look forward to the number that comes from the next "So I grinded offscreen..."
[2:11:37] <anuchallengertwitch> I wonder if Rodin will be a bigger focus in Bayo 3
[2:11:41] <%Taisuru> Shiggy LUL
[2:11:41] <%MechArch> shiggy
[2:11:43] <%AXL808> yeah, Shiggy

[2:12:07] <OswaldTheDog> Scubow and Shigi
[2:12:08] <%0rond> bro what the fuck you don't care about skub
[2:12:10] <%Emperor_Machinus> Shiggy and Scabby
[2:12:10] <%baka_sugoi> shaggy using 0.01% of his power
[2:12:12] <%AzureGale> HANGING ON TO THE EDGE OF TOMORROW
[2:12:15] <%0rond> skub is so fucking important
[2:12:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Scoobo and Shaggers
[2:12:17] <%Fooguwu> Scabby Poo
[2:12:22] <%GarbageNirvana> This is basically just the angel version of that other guy huh
[2:12:28] <+TheRossySauce> isnt this how sonic generations ended?
[2:12:29] <%wibbwobbler> wasn't me
[2:12:30] <%RetroCop87> LIVE AND LEARN
[2:12:33] <%MechArch> frebby
[2:12:36] <%GarbageNirvana> The hell one that ate you
[2:12:41] <$RealThiele> this is a star fox boss
[2:12:47] <%AzureGale> @TheRossySauce No this is how Sonic Adventure 2 ended
[2:13:10] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Rainbow Iustita
[2:13:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> did you know Dr Disrespect isn't a real doctor?
[2:13:24] <Vcom7418> Sonic Generations ends with fighting Time Eater in Doctor Who time vortex
[2:13:33] <%ConLin_Arts_> Is it just me or do the Bayo 1 bosses look more flashy in 2?
[2:13:38] <%MechArch> man , this is just a bayo 1 boss rush
[2:13:45] <%ConLin_Arts_> Like Fortitudo had more armor
[2:13:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> i don't think he even has a masters degree
[2:13:53] <therefortomorrow> Pat please tell me youre going to put on the fox mccloud outfit for that one part
[2:14:06] <Profmcstevie> They have more armour cos this is them 500 years ago during a full scale war
[2:14:08] <%AzureGale> Okay, this is less Sonic Adventure 2 and more Sonic 2006 :x
[2:14:14] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt this sequence felt like a tribute to the end of every Sonic game ever
[2:14:15] <%AXL808> MAGIC
[2:14:17] <%0rond> fingerbang the machine to super charge it
[2:14:18] <dan_g_v> because fuck you
[2:14:21] <$RealThiele> Spiral power
[2:14:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> Not the mech!
[2:14:24] <%MechArch> it's the power of fuck
[2:14:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @AzureGale no, that's not until the final boss fight
[2:14:37] <%ScreamLord> Time to go BOOM!
[2:14:37] <penitentpendant> Mecha needs no words
[2:14:38] <%Buzzard42> doesn't need to be
[2:14:39] <%ssjklyco> And?
[2:14:41] <Vcom7418> I think Sonic 06 is a perfect comparison, fighting god in a weird place
[2:14:47] <anuchallengertwitch> Rosa talks a bit in the beginning
[2:14:48] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> T r u t h
[2:14:48] <HairballCT> @AXL808 i mean the main character is literally a witch so detuneSip
[2:14:50] <purple_bagel> Man i wish they played moon river more often in bayo 2
[2:14:53] <OswaldTheDog> doesn’t that hurt her finger??
[2:14:59] <%Buzzard42> samne
[2:15:00] <%megaman_sentinel> filler
[2:15:05] <%ssjklyco> That's Bayonetta 3
[2:15:06] <%Taisuru> They just wanted to do a mech thing, you can't blame them for that
[2:15:07] <SaltyAzteca> GRIIIIIIIND
[2:15:07] <%Monkeyweed21> it was a demo for the robiut
[2:15:07] <%0rond> kamiya said "I want a mech"
[2:15:08] <%Buzzard42> I'd believe it
[2:15:13] <%Buzzard42> cool robots deserve to be in the game
[2:15:21] <$RealThiele> its platinum having the skeleton of Star fox zero gameplay
[2:15:25] <%Buzzard42> @0rond Kamiya didn't touch Bayo 2
[2:15:26] <%ssjklyco> Bayonetta 3: MechASSault
[2:15:28] <anuchallengertwitch> @Vcom7418 It's funny how the most infamous Sonic game has him go up against his single most powerful final boss ever
[2:15:32] <thelonechris> You think that was a publisher idea to put that section in?
[2:15:38] <%AzureGale> BANG BANG BANG, PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[2:15:51] <@Mechz71> Pat is adopted
[2:15:52] <DrkJP520> If you thought Umbran Climax is OP, the robot will melt
[2:15:53] <%AzureGale> We can't handle the truth
[2:15:55] <Laecerelius> THE SONY PSP!!
[2:15:55] <@Mechz71> That's the truth
[2:16:02] <%baka_sugoi> truf
[2:16:04] <$RealThiele> its out there
[2:16:05] <Vcom7418> @anuchallengertwitch Maybe Time Eater is stronger...but I dunno
[2:16:06] <%Monkeyweed21> testicles are actually more like balls of yarn and can unravel
[2:16:09] <%Buzzard42> the truth is that this whole storyarc kicks ass
[2:16:13] <%0rond> @Buzzard42 he was a writer
[2:16:15] <dariusclover> Was the game rigged from the start?
[2:16:18] <%AzureGale> DA TROOF
[2:16:23] <NitronStreams> hey look it a smash bros stage
[2:16:23] <%AXL808> a very important place in time
[2:16:27] <%Dakuu75> don't tell me we're gonna find out something stupid like bayo and jeane are the same person too
[2:16:35] <OswaldTheDog> @monkeyweed21 what
[2:16:38] <%AXL808> It's a memento!
[2:16:58] <$RealThiele> with time travel everyone is bayo
[2:17:25] <anuchallengertwitch> @Vcom7418 I'd Say Solaris is stronger because it was a superdimensional being capable of eating dimensions and collasped all of time and space just by existing.
[2:18:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @OswaldTheDog if you nut sack is slashed open your testies can unravel cuz they're just big balls of tubes n veins
[2:18:24] <+KaijuBrothers> and death battle said she'd lose to dante, laughable
[2:18:29] <%ScreamLord> Intro Cards?
[2:18:31] <%megaman_sentinel> if they were so powerful why they so dead?
[2:18:36] <Profmcstevie> They didn't write them down yet
[2:18:42] <%Monkeyweed21> thats right Jay
[2:18:42] <Lixagon> I mean it litterally came with bayo 1
[2:18:54] <%AXL808> people don't understand Bayo 1, newcomers will be lost in Bayo 2
[2:18:58] <+CordwoodMather> CordwoodMather subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:19:00] <Vcom7418> I mean, any version of this game you buy physically, Bayo 1 is packed in. And Bayo 1 gets a massive discount if you buy Bayo 2 on either platform
[2:19:32] <Vcom7418> So yeah, you are expected to buy both together lol
[2:19:55] <+abrupt_abe> Boss and enemy rushes are cool
[2:19:59] <dan_g_v> Angels All Stars moment
[2:20:00] <%barkon345> dose anyone actually know how her outfit is still apparently made out of her hair even thought she has short hair in this game?
[2:20:00] <+KaijuBrothers> pat does everybody
[2:20:00] <%AzureGale> "Man, we're doing everybody" - Pat
[2:20:02] <%Monkeyweed21> gotta reuse them assets
[2:20:03] <%Taisuru> Ruhmembuh me
[2:20:18] <Idon__> same way Jeanne's suit was made of her hair in Bayo 1.
[2:20:38] <%Morbidmort> Wait, is Bayo's mom the one who says "THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST"?
[2:20:39] <%ssjklyco> Too bad there was no secret multiplayer in this part
[2:20:44] <%Blackmage9999> psaDogchamp
[2:20:48] <%Monkeyweed21> pubes
[2:21:12] <%MechArch> chainsaws to the face
[2:21:15] <%barkon345> I always liked how the angels in this game actually look like how they are described in the bible
[2:21:22] <+TheotherKristian> Hey everyone, I'm gonna ask this out of spite but, what's on everyone's wishlist for Bayonetta 3??
[2:21:26] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> LICK THE GINGER FEET
[2:21:26] <HairballCT> kinkshame zangief
[2:21:26] <ergulor> feet cheese
[2:21:29] <%AzureGale> But what if you feet have FOOD
[2:21:29] <%Taisuru> Have you been letting Gief talk to Reggie?
[2:21:29] <%RetroCop87> show us him licking your feet
[2:21:31] <parkslady> LUL
[2:21:32] <%AXL808> intro time
[2:21:41] <+KaijuBrothers> @Morbidmort no its the mad umbra lady
[2:21:45] <%weissguard> YEYEYE
[2:21:48] <penitentpendant> One of a Kind is go
[2:21:54] <Idon__> WE'RE DOING THE THING AGAIN
[2:21:55] <%UvBenServed> I CLAPPED
[2:21:57] <DrkJP520> This has to be a different clock tower
[2:22:00] <allyalice> @TheotherKristian for it to come out :(
[2:22:02] <therefortomorrow> Yeah Smash Bros time
[2:22:03] <%AzureGale> Is this that level from Smash Bros.
[2:22:05] <%Taisuru> Every time with the clock tower
[2:22:05] <@SoFarFetched> oh hey
[2:22:08] <HairballCT> aw shit, here we go again
[2:22:10] <devanmuse> Well, if this wasn't already a time paradox and a half
[2:22:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's like SMASH
[2:22:15] <%ssjklyco> So are past Bayo and jean on another clock tower piece?
[2:22:22] <+TheotherKristian> @allyalice lol
[2:22:24] <%weissguard> yeah
[2:22:24] <%wibbwobbler> psaDogchamp
[2:22:27] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @TheotherKristian More of Inferno, more demons, maybe parallel universes if the weird details about Bayo in the trailer point to that, a super awesome finale
[2:22:27] <%AzureGale> When do you fight Marth
[2:22:30] <%0rond> while bayo was fighting along side jeanne on a falling clock tower, she was also at the same time fighting alongside rosa on a falling clocktower
[2:22:31] <%AXL808> i would've like to see a shot of past Bayo and Jeanne fighting in the background
[2:22:34] <+KaijuBrothers> time is an illusion
[2:22:37] <Elsewize> So this is Bayonetta, huh?
[2:22:38] <anuchallengertwitch> @TheotherKristian more info about Rodin, some cool weapons, Maybe some stuff about Zero, Lumen abilities, maybe multverse stuff.
[2:22:49] <%LaughingCatt> hey your blue
[2:22:54] <+KaijuBrothers> its the black evil god
[2:23:00] <%Taisuru> SHITTY CHILD

[2:23:28] <dan_g_v> oh no, the dreaded question
[2:23:30] <%Taisuru> "Feet" psaDogChamp
[2:23:36] <%AzureGale> Did doog eat cat
[2:23:40] <%walternatorz> he wouldn't be eating random things if you let him lick your feet.
[2:23:41] <Laecerelius> Bayo knows the truth! She's making Streets of Rage 4 on the Sony PSP!!
[2:23:42] <%MechArch> gotta get psaBig psaDogchamp
[2:23:49] <%xiccy> I love the game with pets called, "WHAT ARE YOU EATING!!"
[2:23:49] <dan_g_v> saw Elmo eating the candy, now Gief wants the Elmo Candy
[2:23:52] <%shurtal> does Elmo tast delicious? EVERYONE wants to eat his hair
[2:23:52] <OswaldTheDog> ewww
[2:23:54] <%RetroCop87> Elmo can't eat it all himself
[2:23:55] <DrkJP520> fuck, elmo has been eaten
[2:23:59] <%UvBenServed> Why does everyone want Elmo hair?
[2:23:59] <%Grimlockfly> NotLikeThis
[2:24:01] <%AXL808> wow, what's with Elmo's hair that animal want to keep eating it?
[2:24:01] <%Bt_Robot> Wait... she's really Lisa "left -eye" Lopez?
[2:24:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> He is also a pet of good taste. A connoisseur of Elmo hair
[2:24:06] <%r0chelimit> Why is his hair so desirable
[2:24:07] <bettysharkface> What is with everything in your house eating elmo hair
[2:24:11] <%Taisuru> Have you TRIED eating Elmo's hair pat? EVeryone else likes to eat it, maybe you're the problem
[2:24:14] <%Grimlockfly> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[2:24:18] <%alyss988> NotLikeThis
[2:24:23] <chhdez> Who dat
[2:24:28] <%Daxalog> !?
[2:24:30] <DrkJP520> This fall is taking forever lmao
[2:24:32] <%LaughingCatt> Behold my Slappy Hands
[2:24:39] <%AzureGale> Oh shit he's Zenyatta
[2:24:47] <%baronouroboros> That's a yugioh protagonist, ngl
[2:24:48] <%cherubs_anonymous> It's not that hard to follow, guys
[2:24:52] <dinnydanny777> Yay beat the annoying child PogChamp
[2:24:53] <%MechArch> baby arms
[2:24:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh okay
[2:24:54] <%AzureGale> GAZE... INTO THE IRIS
[2:24:54] <%Ranryu692> we playing Asura's Wrath all fo a sudden?
[2:24:59] <%Morbidmort> Hey there, Spectral Asura
[2:24:59] <%RetroCop87> He's a tough little shit
[2:25:00] <penitentpendant> Behold! My somewhat familiar blue hands!
[2:25:01] <%YakumoYomi> Is this Elfen Lied?
[2:25:02] <the_sprankton> Asura looks different
[2:25:03] <anuchallengertwitch> He's Loki's other half
[2:25:05] <NitronStreams> Is this Urizen?
[2:25:11] <%barkon345> thats a cool stand
[2:25:12] <%GarbageNirvana> So he's triangle man
[2:25:13] <%Taisuru> I hate the fights with Loptr
[2:25:16] <%AzureGale> Goro squared
[2:25:25] <krin_x> kids throwin hands
[2:25:27] <%AzureGale> Actually more like Goro x 2
[2:25:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> Aesir being done with work he split into two, one was evil and one was good, good one went into the future and lost his memory
[2:25:50] <devanmuse> So... Loki is actually the... being who bestowed the eyes of the world unto humanity, is it?
[2:25:50] <penitentpendant> And his more damaging shove attack from last time
[2:25:52] <anuchallengertwitch> @NitronStreams sort of. Loki and Loptr are both two halves of the god of chaos aesir.
[2:25:55] <%Taisuru> He breaks out of shit so fast I fucking hate it
[2:26:06] <%RetroCop87> play easy mode
[2:26:13] <%baka_sugoi> stand arms
[2:26:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> well this is on hard
[2:26:19] <%cherubs_anonymous> It's funny how the younger version of Loptr is stronger
[2:26:21] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt you can slam him down in witch time with the whip and than chain saw him, repeat until dead
[2:26:26] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Hey Pat, both Elmo and Gief seems to love eating Elmo's hair. Have you tried the hair? Are you sure it isn't just delicious?
[2:26:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @devanmuse pretty much. Loki gave them the eyes, and Loptr, his other half, didn't like that
[2:26:33] <NitronStreams> I know Loptrs deal. I was just drawing a comparison.
[2:26:37] <allyalice> just use a green lollipop nobody will know you wont even see a penalty, cmon we wont tell anyone
[2:26:39] <%AXL808> he's more like dodge offset until wicked weave
[2:26:46] <penitentpendant> This looks like a boss that almost mandates fishing for dodging
[2:26:48] <dinnydanny777> Beat the horrible fake accent out of him
[2:27:13] <%0rond> @PatStaresAt you can grab him with the whip in witch time
[2:27:14] <%baka_sugoi> MUDA MUDA
[2:27:19] <%RetroCop87> ??????????
[2:27:21] <%barkon345> wait so this game is based around NOrse mythology?

[2:30:25] <%ConLin_Arts_> he made Bayo fall in love with lollipops
[2:30:25] <AMUSERNAME> Luka, why do you have to make that callback AS CREEPY AS POSSIBLE !?!
[2:30:25] <%cherubs_anonymous> He gave babby Cereza a lolipop
[2:30:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The first game you goon
[2:30:28] <%shurtal> Cereza
[2:30:30] <DrkJP520> Girls passing out infront of Luka? Dude, what're you doing to them?
[2:30:33] <Vcom7418> He gave Cereza last game a lollipop. And now lookk what happened with Bayo

[2:31:16] <anuchallengertwitch> Grace and Glory: WE'RE BAAAACK
[2:31:28] <Vcom7418> @TheotherKristian I think it's your laptop. Stuff's fine on my end
[2:31:39] <Vcom7418> It's not a bad story, it's a no story
[2:31:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> baaaaaaaaaaad boi
[2:31:43] <Elsewize> Dante vs Bayo, who wins?
[2:31:47] <anuchallengertwitch> @M4T1A5 If Bayo 3 goes into a multiverse, probably 100
[2:31:47] <+chaumiester> Would you say the situation is..... Hairy?
[2:31:50] <%Morbidmort> @M4T1A5 At LEAST 6
[2:31:51] <%cafefunk> Why is it bad?
[2:31:51] <%RetroCop87> that fucking slide
[2:31:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ddante
[2:31:56] <devanmuse> Baldr sliding into her DMs
[2:31:56] <dinnydanny777> That slide LUL
[2:31:57] <%Monkeyweed21> hey W101 has a good story if you ignore Luka
[2:32:02] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> KILLED WITH CARD
[2:32:06] <anuchallengertwitch> @Elsewize Dante, especially after 5
[2:32:29] <%ConLin_Arts_> the one you fought was him from this time
[2:32:32] <%alyss988> psaWhat
[2:32:34] <%Taisuru> Of course we can
[2:32:35] <Idon__> WHAT
[2:32:37] <Idon__> HOW
[2:32:39] <%Morbidmort> They can, I guess
[2:32:39] <%RetroCop87> shut up, platinum
[2:32:41] <redrins> cause magic
[2:32:41] <%Fooguwu> cuz witches and time pat
[2:32:41] <+abrupt_abe> Moooooooooooooooon
[2:32:42] <%BioHunter> she did this in bayo 1
[2:32:43] <%LaughingCatt> casual time travel because why not
[2:32:43] <%baronblank> oh, I guess they can just time travel freely huh
[2:32:45] <penitentpendant> That a useful pane of glass, I guess?
[2:32:46] <%UvBenServed> Cause fuck it
[2:32:46] <SCIENCE_25> Timey wimey bullshit
[2:32:46] <%Agami23> i guess circles are just portals? they always seem to be.
[2:32:46] <%Ranryu692> why not?
[2:32:47] <%Visorak6> Well pat umbran witches have time powers so
[2:32:52] <%Xevtes> BAYO 3 should start the story over again. this is bad
[2:32:52] <%RLT917> psaWhat
[2:32:53] <%Standard_Enemy> Actual magic lol
[2:32:53] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Isn't that where she went back to in Bayo 1?
[2:32:54] <ammobasket> Moon
[2:32:55] <%RaziWraith> psaWhat cuz she said so
[2:32:55] <%megaman_sentinel> what is happening NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:32:57] <+shoryukenabotch> MAGIC THO
[2:32:57] <%LaughingCatt> no, says the game
[2:32:59] <%AXL808> bayo can time travel wneever she wants, just chooses not to
[2:32:59] <OswaldTheDog> wait, HOW?
[2:33:03] <+Cobaltor_252> since when could she time travel
[2:33:06] <%baronblank> if they can time travel freely why don't they do it more
[2:33:09] <%baka_sugoi> BUTTS
[2:33:17] <$StrawberryPantsu> @Elsewize Bayo can slow time, while Dante can STOP time.
[2:33:21] <%baka_sugoi> TIME
[2:33:21] <%BioHunter> bayo sent her kid self back in time remember?
[2:33:23] <%LaughingCatt> Moon Rocks & Butt Magic
[2:33:26] <%Taisuru> @Cobaltor_252 Since shutup
[2:33:28] <%VetranKamikaze> All my homies hate gravity
[2:33:31] <dinnydanny777> Bayo has the power of yelling do over and you didn't win
[2:33:31] <cloakofashes> It's all very simple and easy to explain. You see OH MY GOD IS THAT A BEAR?
[2:33:31] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Nah
[2:33:36] <%snow_bush> WUT
[2:33:38] <%AkronymCLT> Why does she know his name now?
[2:33:39] <%baka_sugoi> FATHER
[2:33:39] <%AXL808> she IS the Left Eye
[2:33:43] <chhdez> IT WAS ME, BARRY
[2:33:43] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> because the development budget may have been running low
[2:33:46] <%ConLin_Arts_> Time
[2:33:48] <%Agami23> i think she needs a circle
[2:33:48] <DrkJP520> THERE'S NO TIME
[2:33:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> is traveling
[2:33:53] <%M4T1A5> Yeah I never get that with stories
[2:33:54] <Profmcstevie> ......they don't fix EVERYTHING in 2 huh
[2:33:55] <%RetroCop87> time is relative
[2:33:57] <%baronblank> for some reason the present is moving at the same time as the past?
[2:33:57] <%Ynkubus_> Do it before the procrastination sets in!
[2:33:58] <xinexes> THERES NO TIME
[2:33:58] <therealritzreal> THERES no time
[2:33:59] <%Daxalog> Fixed points?
[2:34:00] <%baronblank> makes no sense
[2:34:00] <dan_g_v> do you want it to be MCU time travel? No, never
[2:34:02] <%ConLin_Arts_> Baldaaaaa
[2:34:02] <%AXL808> Loptr can destroy time
[2:34:03] <+TheotherKristian> The answer is shut up, time travel
[2:34:04] <+Delenay> bayo just say father
[2:34:04] <Elsewize> Window of Opportunity?
[2:34:07] <laserbeaming> balda
[2:34:07] <%RaziWraith> Wouldn't you be in a hurry to time travel if you could time travel? :)
[2:34:08] <+Delenay> like .... you know
[2:34:09] <%AzureGale> Maybe whent he time travel portal is about to close
[2:34:11] <%baka_sugoi> TIME IS AN ILLUSION
[2:34:11] <%alyss988> no time
[2:34:14] <+Delenay> it would snap him out of it
[2:34:16] <%megaman_sentinel> it's time it's not going anywhere
[2:34:18] <+AzureHalo> Probably position of the moon shenanigans?
[2:34:19] <Vcom7418> Not doing stuff fast enough in past time to complete a bootstrap loop = paradox
[2:34:19] <%Grimlockfly> There’s no time, Pat!
[2:34:21] <DartAran> I guess if the moonlight goes away?
[2:34:22] <+Cobaltor_252> I'm STILL confused
[2:34:23] <OswaldTheDog> I’m so confused lmao
[2:34:28] <$StrawberryPantsu> MUMMY
[2:34:30] <dinnydanny777> aw
[2:34:31] <%AzureGale> EPIC HAND GRAB
[2:34:31] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> m u m m y
[2:34:33] <chhdez> Throw some lollipops at her
[2:34:33] <%ConLin_Arts_> momther
[2:34:34] <%Morbidmort> Maybe the portal can only be open so long?
[2:34:34] <+ThomasOfTroy> There might be some kind of restrictions, just like with irl theories of how time travel might work
[2:34:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Wut?
[2:34:34] <NitronStreams> MUTHEERRRRRRRRRR
[2:34:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> Mother...

[2:34:57] <+Delenay> only reason he was there was because 2 happened?
[2:34:58] <WonderSign> what are you taaalking about
[2:34:58] <%LaughingCatt> Timey Wimey Shenanigans
[2:34:58] <+Cobaltor_252> shut up don't think about it
[2:34:58] <%weissguard> Nah, we just saw the scene as it originally played out before.
[2:34:58] <laserbeaming> ha, missed two verses
[2:34:59] <%ConLin_Arts_> TIME TRAVEL
[2:35:00] <%MechArch> stop thinking pat
[2:35:03] <ne0bunny> no cos this actually did happen
[2:35:04] <%Deft_Thought> Baldur's already been pulled out of time, I guess
[2:35:04] <Vcom7418> Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey
[2:35:07] <ammobasket> Memory is weird
[2:35:09] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Pat's losing it LUL
[2:35:09] <dan_g_v> best of the lot!
[2:35:10] <dinnydanny777> That victory screen after the "mummy no" is making me LUL
[2:35:11] <+Delenay> i hate timetravel when its done wrong
[2:35:12] <%Taisuru> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT
[2:35:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Kamiya doesnt know how Time Travel works
[2:35:13] <fiabobia> time travel suuuuucks
[2:35:14] <%RaziWraith> and ya'll want Bayo 3? LUL
[2:35:15] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Shut up, don't think about it
[2:35:15] <DrkJP520> He was there twice yes, like a few minutes apart
[2:35:21] <%Plesin> anyway time for the final boss
[2:35:21] <%Morbidmort> One timeline that twists on itself?
[2:35:23] <$Protochimp> What is it with kamiya and mums
[2:35:24] <ergulor> tie traveling stories tend to go south easily
[2:35:26] <penitentpendant> Writing about time travel can be easily botched
[2:35:27] <%Grimlockfly> Dammit, Pat, there’s no time!
[2:35:30] <%baronblank> LUL
[2:35:31] <Vcom7418> @Monkeyweed21 Kamiya produced, he didn't right
[2:35:33] <%Standard_Enemy> Who needs good story when combat is fantastic lol
[2:35:35] <Stormo> no one is playing character action games for the story though
[2:35:36] <OswaldTheDog> there was like...no planning when they wrote this story
[2:35:37] <%Taisuru> Imagine if this had solid time travel writing like Legacy of Kain
[2:35:38] <%MechArch> @RaziWraith it will be explained in bayo 3
[2:35:39] <+TheotherKristian> It's so stupid isn't it great?
[2:35:40] <anuchallengertwitch> @RaziWraith yes. I kinda like Bayonetta's story
[2:35:44] <%baka_sugoi> IDK LUL
[2:35:56] <%Ne1son> Jump??
[2:35:57] <%AzureGale> Jump, jump
[2:35:58] <Vcom7418> @penitentpendant Writing about Time Travel is always botched. Something somewhere somehow won't make any sense. Take it from a Doctor Who fan XD
[2:35:59] <%LaughingCatt> That line doesnt make sense Bayonetta
[2:36:03] <+Delenay> why and how
[2:36:04] <%Plesin> JET
[2:36:07] <therealritzreal> Thats why we have to wait till 3 LUL
[2:36:11] <SCIENCE_25> D:
[2:36:12] <cloakofashes> okay then

[2:36:53] <laserbeaming> it's a VERY fast jet
[2:36:54] <+Delenay> .... was there
[2:36:55] <fiabobia> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[2:36:56] <SaltyAzteca> WITCH PARADOX
[2:36:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It literally not a few weeks ago
[2:37:00] <%ssjklyco> They'll fix it in Bayo 3 with more time travel
[2:37:00] <%snow_bush> Time, like cats, is fluid
[2:37:03] <%Deft_Thought> I can't believe Enzo is fucking dead
[2:37:05] <%baronblank> wow this feels super weird and rushed
[2:37:11] <Elsewize> Also, no budget for lip synching?
[2:37:12] <%baka_sugoi> TIME PAPA
[2:37:12] <%Mendin> SPACE HARRIER TIME
[2:37:15] <%Dakuu75> After Burnner lol
[2:37:15] <anuchallengertwitch> Daddy daughter teamup
[2:37:16] <+Animatic_> is this space harrier again
[2:37:18] <$RealThiele> new arcade game
[2:37:19] <Idon__> oh not this again.....
[2:37:20] <penitentpendant> @Vcom7418 The big thing about writing about time travel is you have to pick a set of rule and stick to it. If you write a single arc featuring time travel, it's fine. When you try to make sequels or series, you generally fail.
[2:37:23] <%LaughingCatt> TIME FOR MORE SPACE HARRIER
[2:37:25] <%RaziWraith> Another space harrier mission LUL
[2:37:26] <%megaman_sentinel> Star Fox 64
[2:37:27] <%AzureGale> LOL AFTER BURNER REFERENCE
[2:37:32] <chhdez> Boxelios!
[2:37:33] <SomersaultJustice> I like this part with the fox outfit
[2:37:33] <Vcom7418> Is this the stage where if you where Star Fox outfit, you get R-Wing?
[2:37:36] <%baronblank> maybe instead of retreading so much bayo 1 they should have spent time making the story make sense
[2:37:36] <%Bamcrash> Afterburner reference
[2:37:40] <laserbeaming> Well, at least this Space Harrier game is a little better than the one in Bayo 1
[2:37:41] <%RaziWraith> Except it's a little better in this one at least
[2:37:42] <+transporterthesequel> It's literally After Burner

[2:38:10] <%Taisuru> Space Goat
[2:38:11] <%Daxalog> Hes out of it
[2:38:12] <%cherubs_anonymous> Pat, you're dying
[2:38:15] <BigNerdSam> No-Shower Pedophile Man
[2:38:15] <+A0N33> WHAT?
[2:38:15] <%king_wragles> R wing?
[2:38:15] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> ALL OF THAT WAS WRONG LUL
[2:38:16] <ShichiNoBushi> R-Wing?
[2:38:20] <%shurtal> Pat, LIVE ON AIR, giving up
[2:38:21] <Laecerelius> Pat's brain just stopped
[2:38:21] <+chaumiester> @OswaldTheDog Stocks
[2:38:21] <%Ranryu692> Pat needs sleep
[2:38:22] <+RyTYoung> Pat is high
[2:38:25] <%Nobrev> pat are you having a stroke
[2:38:27] <%Grimlockfly> Just like Star Horse 64
[2:38:27] <%Fooguwu> what does that MEAN
[2:38:30] <%Foxsploder> @OswaldTheDog She probably just stole it
[2:38:32] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:38:37] <%Dakuu75> we're all dying, right now even
[2:38:41] <DrkJP520> dio's knives
[2:38:42] <%RetroCop87> Pat, put on your pants
[2:38:44] <xxshadowxx416> @oswaldthedog she teacher
[2:38:46] <therealritzreal> Rouge Foxdron
[2:38:47] <penitentpendant> Does Pat need to witch time some dog cuddling to recover?
[2:38:48] <ammobasket> Arwing
[2:38:50] <Vcom7418> Man. This game is just pretty
[2:38:55] <%Grimlockfly> Bark Bark Bark goes the Star Horse
[2:39:00] <%megaman_sentinel> how is she talking to them
[2:39:07] <%Agami23> this is a weird gummy ship section
[2:39:13] <SCIENCE_25> You can
[2:39:13] <RyuuAoi> What I miss?
[2:39:18] <%AkronymCLT> Young Balder is super cool
[2:39:20] <dinnydanny777> He's basically just Xemnas
[2:39:21] <+RyTYoung> Balder's Gate? Kappa
[2:39:23] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Truly the Vergil of Bayonetta May Cry
[2:39:25] <%Ynkubus_> I can hear the Ace Combat horns in this ost
[2:39:26] <Idon__> swords > guns always
[2:39:27] <%RetroCop87> Why can't you play as Kiryu, I wanna play as Kiryu
[2:39:28] <%Foxsploder> Balder's Great
[2:39:34] <%AXL808> their attacks are so cool
[2:39:38] <%Blank9> the tag bullshit is awesome, it has so many unique bosses
[2:39:40] <%RaziWraith> YOU can play as Rodin in Tag Climax?????
[2:39:46] <%Dakuu75> balder didn't get unlocked in the crowd fund tier
[2:39:46] <%weissguard> Maybe that'll be a thing in Bayo 3? (At least I hope so.)
[2:39:53] <%LaughingCatt> @Idon__ that is why Vergil is the best, because his guns are swords
[2:39:55] <+InsanityEvolved> InsanityEvolved subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:56] <Vyneci> This is why we need a PC port of this, so someone can mod him in, unfortunately it'll never happen BibleThump
[2:39:57] <RyuuAoi> Balder is Sparda
[2:39:58] <+kullumanati> It’s a shame. It’s Balder-gate.
[2:39:59] <%Bt_Robot> The furry what with the ship? That's gotta be ARWING JONES head of G-Zero Racing.
[2:40:00] <%Taisuru> @RaziWraith Yes, after basically beating all of tag climax :V
[2:40:01] <%Blank9> yeah, rodin has no dodge, his dodge button is a 360 barrier
[2:40:03] <%Mendin> This is just a W101 boss
[2:40:09] <%AkronymCLT> Can Majima be the protagonist of Bayo 3? He'd rock the outfit
[2:40:13] <+RyTYoung> @ryuuaoi PogChamp
[2:40:13] <bettysharkface> I leave for like 5 minutes and now we're on a jet flying towards a mountain, I cannot keep up with this game.
[2:40:26] <laserbeaming> the Tag Multiplayer mode was kind of a waste of dev time
[2:40:40] <%ssjklyco> I litterally forgot this Balder is also Balder in bayo one I wonder how he became crazy
[2:40:44] <+abrupt_abe> There's a lot of bullshit in Bayo
[2:40:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> DMC5 Isn't even as good as DMC3
[2:40:48] <Laecerelius> few things keep up like DMC3
[2:40:50] <%Dakuu75> is tat bad?
[2:40:51] <%Mendin> Everybody's Idol Goro(mi) as an Umbra Witch
[2:40:52] <penitentpendant> When you peel off Nostalgia, you remember how much filler there was you forgot
[2:40:53] <$RealThiele> mini-games
[2:40:53] <%Daxalog> Give you a break after doing a boss I guess.
[2:40:58] <%Mendin> Nick Ogata as a Lumen Sage
[2:40:59] <xxshadowxx416> dmc more story then bayo
[2:40:59] <%Agami23> closer to DmC than DMC
[2:41:01] <Vcom7418> I mean there is one reason these are called "Spectacle Fighters"
[2:41:04] <%LaughingCatt> Kinda really sticks out with the game that has gameplay, spectacle, & a surprisingly good story
[2:41:05] <Aydarkzero> what the flying mini-game?
[2:41:05] <allyalice> tbh i hope the minigame setpiece junk is gone in bayo3 bc i cant stand it
[2:41:12] <%weissguard> It's the biggest flaw of Platinum Games' stuff. It's a lot of spectacle.
[2:41:14] <%Morbidmort> @ssjklyco Bayo 1 and 2 are a legit stable time loop
[2:41:15] <Profmcstevie> DMC3 was made by a man who didn't want to be remembered for DMC2, that is motivation LIKE NO OTHER
[2:41:22] <RyuuAoi> ARCADE
[2:41:22] <$StrawberryPantsu> @Dakuu75 No. DMC3 is just that good though.
[2:41:23] <+RyTYoung> Pat you should play Rising Revengeance again
[2:41:24] <%Mendin> Did we ever learn why Nick Ogata was like the Crime Illuminati in Y7
[2:41:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> @ssjklyco They explain that
[2:41:32] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah platinum games are more of a rollercoaster than capcom's output
[2:41:32] <%Taisuru> @allyalice It's Platinum, they LOVE this shit
[2:41:40] <%Deft_Thought> It's always bothered me how many action games seem to lose faith in how enjoyable the main gameplay loop is. They start heaping minigames and spectacle fights into the games which are fine enough for the first playthrough but lose steam
[2:41:42] <dan_g_v> Spectacle in my spectacle game? It's more likely than you can imagine
[2:41:43] <%wibbwobbler> nope lol
[2:41:44] <%charp35> the starfox version is better
[2:41:48] <+transporterthesequel> At least the best fight in the game isn't locked behind it.
[2:41:48] <%Grimlockfly> The afterburner and space harrier gimmick levels wear out their welcome
[2:41:49] <Idon__> Bayonetta 3 is going to have EVEN MORE minigame sections hggLul
[2:41:49] <%Agami23> it ads variety by making you play a piece of shit instead of the good game
[2:41:49] <laserbeaming> it's way longer than it should be
[2:41:51] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Insidious again baybeeee
[2:41:53] <%LaughingCatt> Platinum puts the After Burner stages into almost all their games & they always suck
[2:41:55] <%Agami23> thats just a menos grande!
[2:42:08] <%Jrocy247> Aw, doesn't have the Starfox Costume on?
[2:42:08] <%Mendin> base Revengeance can be banged out in like 1-2 sessions too, it's short
[2:42:17] <%weissguard> @Mendin He's a very successful businessman, who at some point when the Yakuza were active would've had to do business with or against them.
[2:42:18] <DartAran> They can be fun the first time they suuuuuuck on replay
[2:42:20] <dan_g_v> Insidius is pretty cool
[2:42:31] <+RyTYoung> @mendin true
[2:42:35] <xxshadowxx416> dmc have a good storyline well bayo crazy action
[2:42:35] <Aydarkzero> 1hp monkaS
[2:42:39] <Aydarkzero> d e t h
[2:42:42] <NitronStreams> F
[2:42:45] <%AzureGale> ded
[2:42:51] <Profmcstevie> All cos Jeanne didn't fly around it
[2:42:53] <penitentpendant> Be empowered by the Blep
[2:42:54] <%Daxalog> Uh oh
[2:42:54] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[2:42:56] <%Deft_Thought> Good storyline in DMC?
[2:42:57] <%Mendin> the blep remains cast
[2:42:58] <%Daxalog> Oh goodness
[2:43:01] <%Deft_Thought> Not even close
[2:43:01] <DianaTheAscian> oh thank god
[2:43:02] <RyuuAoi> Geam hard
[2:43:06] <twoface1240> EASY MODE IS SELECTABLE
[2:43:35] <%Standard_Enemy> As long as platinum keeps that amazing checkpoint and mission replay system Astral Chain has that lets you pick what part of the mission you wanna start at, then Im okay with the gimmick missions
[2:43:38] <Laecerelius> That's NO GOOD!
[2:43:38] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but a lot of games evoke that feeling LUL
[2:43:39] <+Pharmakokinetic> just gotta claw grip and pam both attacks and these missions are ez
[2:43:41] <%Monkeyweed21> not really
[2:43:45] <dan_g_v> the gitgud sign
[2:43:47] <ghostkingwho> or maybe, just maybe the player sucks
[2:43:48] <Profmcstevie> Or just a lot of experience playing awful checkpointing
[2:43:54] <%Standard_Enemy> for bayo 3 and future titles
[2:43:54] <%AzureGale> That should be a GOOD sign. They know where the most harrowing parts are
[2:43:56] <%Dakuu75> that's a GOOD sign! It means it's a propper good checkpoint! psaWrong
[2:43:57] <%Ranryu692> I feel a lot better about thinking Bayo 1 wasn't that good when I first played it a year or two ago
[2:43:59] <KaiserMario> Nier Automata
[2:43:59] <penitentpendant> A shame it's stuck on console
[2:44:00] <%LaughingCatt> lobosKek holy shit
[2:44:01] <$RealThiele> Dark souls is the king of that feeling
[2:44:04] <SCIENCE_25> It kinda is
[2:44:05] <%baronblank> metal gear rising though
[2:44:05] <dan_g_v> do better so you don't need the checkpoint sign
[2:44:06] <%Blank9> astral chain definitely is
[2:44:08] <%cvp5127> sad its trapped on the switch
[2:44:11] <%Blank9> the postgame is incredible
[2:44:13] <laserbeaming> I would agree
[2:44:14] <+twohitgood> nier automata? or does that count more for square?
[2:44:14] <Profmcstevie> Guess you gotta replay them all and acquire wisdom
[2:44:15] <+chaumiester> Don't know, still enjoy Nier more
[2:44:15] <%Monkeyweed21> what about W101?
[2:44:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ye
[2:44:18] <+abrupt_abe> Astral Chain's investigation stuff was way too much
[2:44:18] <RyuuAoi> HOT TAKE
[2:44:21] <+Dova573> idk man I finish this game but havet finsihed astral chain
[2:44:22] <Vyneci> It's made even worse because of the shooting stage in 1, where the only checkpoints are at the start of 3~5 minute long verses
[2:44:24] <+alphonseisbest> Nah it's still totally MGS Rising
[2:44:28] <%Nobrev> i agree
[2:44:34] <SomersaultJustice> 'so astral chain playthrough next?
[2:44:37] <%baronblank> @alphonseisbest YES
[2:44:38] <$StrawberryPantsu> Astral Chain is great,but the "Devil Trigger" is shit in that game
[2:44:40] <%Blank9> it has a full on unique true final boss in that postgame
[2:44:51] <%Grimlockfly> do it again tho
[2:44:51] <$StrawberryPantsu> PLAY IT AGAIN
[2:44:53] <%AzureGale> Play it again
[2:44:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> AGAIN
[2:44:56] <+RyTYoung> Rising Revengeance it is then
[2:44:57] <samazam94> MGRR was waaay too short
[2:44:59] <%Standard_Enemy> There are so many hidden enemies in Astral chain its fuckin bonkers
[2:44:59] <%wibbwobbler> another one
[2:45:00] <%kyh9> Astral Chain is kind of underrated
[2:45:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> I tried doing most of the post game but one mission felt impossible, it was like one hit, and the bomb enemies
[2:45:02] <%snackcanary> Do it again
[2:45:02] <DrkJP520> I did everything in Astral Chain. Those last post game missions are sadistic
[2:45:02] <ShichiNoBushi> How many times have you played RE2?
[2:45:03] <%LaughingCatt> doitagain
[2:45:03] <%Grimlockfly> PLAY IT AGAIN
[2:45:03] <dan_g_v> yeh, again! :3
[2:45:03] <+KoldFusion87> stream it again
[2:45:05] <Profmcstevie> But again though, do better
[2:45:06] <SCIENCE_25> But again doe
[2:45:07] <%Mendin> Revengeance time hell yeah
[2:45:08] <%RaziWraith> GO AGANE! LUL
[2:45:10] <%Deft_Thought> How did Luka climb that mountain with no gear?
[2:45:10] <dan_g_v> we need a round 2
[2:45:11] <%Nobrev> @SomersaultJustice didnt he already do astral chain
[2:45:12] <laserbeaming> Astral Chain Post Game Stream
[2:45:16] <therealritzreal> True boss tho?
[2:45:18] <%Deft_Thought> Like, not even a heavy coat
[2:45:19] <RyuuAoi> Monkeyweed?
[2:45:22] <SomersaultJustice> so dragon's dogma playthrough next? Kappa
[2:45:22] <%Grimlockfly> DARK HERO ROUND 2
[2:45:23] <%Jrocy247> Do the Platinum TMNT game you coward Kappa
[2:45:25] <%kyh9> I hope Astral Chain 2 has only one Legion that has branching paths on how it can evolve
[2:45:25] <+twohitgood> he did astral chain when it came out.
[2:45:30] <%AXL808> NO TIME, PAT!
[2:45:36] <penitentpendant> Triangle Man, Triangle Man...
[2:45:37] <%Bt_Robot> Dude, Twitch even used footage from the playthrough in ads!
[2:45:38] <%LaughingCatt> oh god this guy
[2:45:40] <%Plesin> Ngl this game has aged alright, dmc3 is def better though.
[2:45:43] <%Ranryu692> NieR is the best Platinum game but Astral Chain is the best Pure Platinum game
[2:45:47] <%Tyrimat> This kid has worse hair than yugimoto
[2:45:53] <%weissguard> Hey Look! It's the worst designed character in the whole of Bayonetta's continuity!
[2:45:57] <%AXL808> because he's EVIL
[2:45:58] <SCIENCE_25> Shhh Pat :)
[2:45:58] <Magicbrony> @StrawberryPantsu but the fight were you get the "devil Trigger" is cool, atleast if youre the female since the male version of the dark hero song is kinda ass. female song is great
[2:45:58] <+RyTYoung> uhhhh
[2:46:00] <%Daxalog> Sssshhh
[2:46:00] <penitentpendant> When you control Time, you can be the age you feel
[2:46:00] <%Jrocy247> Because shut up
[2:46:01] <%Morbidmort> he wanted to
[2:46:02] <%shurtal> he got bored
[2:46:03] <@SoFarFetched> is he just naked under there D:
[2:46:03] <dan_g_v> because he wanted longer legs
[2:46:04] <%Fooguwu> chosen form?
[2:46:04] <%Taisuru> He chose to like Dante
[2:46:06] <+chaumiester> He wanted a bigger schlong to fight off witches
[2:46:07] <+Cobaltor_252> because shut up
[2:46:07] <ergulor> he went young to fool bayoneta
[2:46:07] <%LaughingCatt> Why does he dress like a Dorito Drag Queen
[2:46:09] <%Mendin> The Cosmic Rhombus
[2:46:10] <Idon__> Why is he a fucking rhombus
[2:46:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ooooh~ Kaiba-boy.
[2:46:10] <+Delenay> because adult form means they are mean... idk japan
[2:46:12] <%AXL808> evil adults
[2:46:14] <therealritzreal> 2020Shhh
[2:46:15] <+BlackJack607> Holy shit that guys look like an absolute tool.
[2:46:19] <%AncelDeLambert> "Great, we got here.... now what?"
[2:46:21] <Laecerelius> Magic
[2:46:24] <%shurtal> magic
[2:46:26] <BlindGato> Magic
[2:46:31] <%Monkeyweed21> its a purgatory triangle
[2:46:31] <NitronStreams> Shut up tho...
[2:46:32] <%Grimlockfly> Shut up Pat, there;'s no time!
[2:46:32] <%Nobrev> because shut up thats why
[2:46:33] <dan_g_v> He heard Bayo talking shit about his Small one self so he grew taller
[2:46:33] <+oktavia_von> bigger question is why he looks like a metapod
[2:46:33] <%Ynkubus_> *sigh* cos magic
[2:46:34] <%MechArch> clouds covered it
[2:46:35] <%Ranryu692> because he realized his pre-pubescent voice was really annoying and chose to age up
[2:46:35] <%SaiyanShoto> That other Loki design is pretty bad
[2:46:35] <%Morbidmort> @BlackJack607 he is
[2:46:35] <Profmcstevie> We obscure it with hell energies
[2:46:36] <%Deft_Thought> Nah, triangle is only in Purgatorio or some shit
[2:46:37] <%Emperor_Machinus> Might be built in purgatorio
[2:46:39] <+Delenay> its olympus?
[2:46:40] <frankavich> No, It wouldn't
[2:46:40] <fritz_dacat> It has A plot field around it
[2:46:41] <RyuuAoi> Why did wonder woman grow up?
[2:46:41] <%AncelDeLambert> no but magic tho
[2:46:42] <KaiserMario> Yeah, I gues Nier is cheating a bit because it's only one with a good story
[2:46:43] <%RaziWraith> Nvm mind that Pat. There is no time! :_
[2:46:44] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:46:48] <%AXL808> i don't think it was visible earlier
[2:46:48] <%RaziWraith> :)
[2:46:51] <+Cobaltor_252> and when you stand at the top of the triangle STRANDS start coming from the sky
[2:46:51] <ShichiNoBushi> A wizard did it.
[2:46:59] <+chaumiester> So this game is trapped on the Switch?
[2:47:00] <%AncelDeLambert> objectively not
[2:47:02] <%kyh9> I need Astral Chain 2
[2:47:04] <%wibbwobbler> yup
[2:47:04] <+RyTYoung> amen
[2:47:06] <DianaTheAscian> it wins easily
[2:47:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> Automata's Combat is mid as shit
[2:47:09] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s a Bayonetta game who cares
[2:47:12] <Saltmeisterr> Ok but is automata even a plat game?
[2:47:12] <Idon__> Is Platinum making the Nier: Replicant Remake?
[2:47:12] <%Grimlockfly> Cuz Yoko Taro wrote it
[2:47:13] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Near Oughta Matta
[2:47:14] <+Caidezes> Platinum is only good at stories when Yoko Taro is doing them.
[2:47:14] <Laecerelius> Autotomatos is pretty great
[2:47:16] <RyuuAoi> Hot take 2
[2:47:16] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[2:47:16] <+balouie> i hated nier automata
[2:47:17] <laserbeaming> I prefer the action in Astral Chain, but Nier Automata has good story
[2:47:17] <Profmcstevie> Platinums bullshit mixing with Yoko Taros bullshit
[2:47:19] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat U think we could get a MGS Rising stream anytime soon? since ur on a platinum streak
[2:47:20] <%Monkeyweed21> MGR only has six enemy types in the whole game
[2:47:20] <gooner4654> someone is actually streaming zelda cdi🤣
[2:47:22] <%LaughingCatt> its Platinum's best game AND Yoko Taro's best game because they covered each others weaknesses lobosKek
[2:47:22] <%Agami23> i'll disagree
[2:47:25] <%kyh9> Ehhhhhh, Nier’s combat is too easy, the dodging is too strong
[2:47:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> Nier a banana
[2:47:32] <%Agami23> metal gear rising doesen't have you play as 9s
[2:47:34] <dan_g_v> automato
[2:47:35] <dinnydanny777> Why does the adult Loki no longer have that horrible English accent, is it because Bayo beat it out of him?
[2:47:35] <+twohitgood> nier au tomatoes
[2:47:36] <%AncelDeLambert> autotomato was an incomprehensible mess
[2:47:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> Mom, Pat is having a stroke again
[2:47:38] <+balouie> it was a game I wish I liked
[2:47:39] <+Eiiriika> it's okay some ppl are just wrong
[2:47:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Would Akira Howard ever be in Smash?
[2:47:43] <samazam94> the butts and boy shorts was enough to qualify that
[2:47:43] <Aydarkzero> i haven't played a single Plat game
[2:47:44] <+DrFacilier> wrong opinion detected
[2:47:45] <%Fooguwu> Spoken like a true "only did route A" player
[2:47:46] <marvel877> Is Pat's brain melting again or something?
[2:47:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Astral Chain is just Chaos Legion 2
[2:47:52] <%Daxalog> Neir Automata killed my dog
[2:47:53] <%kyh9> Taro’s writing can’t make up for how easy NierA is
[2:47:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> @kyh9 Same.
[2:47:58] <%RaziWraith> @gooner4654 Excuse me, fellow chat member. Do you not like the best zelda? :)
[2:47:59] <penitentpendant> The Dog... Remains... BLEP!
[2:48:01] <jorniev> nier automata also has a good sotry
[2:48:02] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Always melting
[2:48:05] <%Bt_Robot> Those endings were so difficult to get.
[2:48:06] <%Monkeyweed21> its been melting
[2:48:09] <Vyneci> Is it ever not melting?
[2:48:10] <jorniev> story
[2:48:11] <%Ranryu692> Pat is sleepy
[2:48:15] <%AncelDeLambert> daily
[2:48:15] <zipperdude33> Maybe a lot
[2:48:15] <RyuuAoi> Trip
[2:48:16] <%Daxalog> Once a month
[2:48:18] <%MechArch> don't worry about it
[2:48:18] <Aydarkzero> about every few months
[2:48:19] <%Standard_Enemy> Nier Automata DLC was hard as fuck I loved it
[2:48:20] <%king_wragles> More than mine, bruh
[2:48:21] <%Nekros4442> Like once a stream
[2:48:21] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Forever
[2:48:22] <%Ynkubus_> never not melting
[2:48:23] <%BioHunter> very often
[2:48:23] <%Mendin> About once a week
[2:48:23] <%Monkeyweed21> at least 1 a week
[2:48:24] <+alphonseisbest> OFFTEN
[2:48:25] <fritz_dacat> depends
[2:48:30] <DianaTheAscian> 24/7
[2:48:30] <%Ranryu692> at least thrice a stream
[2:48:30] <%Daxalog> Theres always one stream a month where it gets worrying
[2:48:31] <marvel877> As many times as Paige streams...
[2:48:32] <@SoFarFetched> Well your brain is probably melting from all that audio fixing you had to do this morning.
[2:48:33] <%dasmause> granblue couldve been platinum's best game, but not anymore
[2:48:35] <%Ironbuttz> Pats brain has become fondue
[2:48:36] <DrkJP520> Isn't it fun how this has one of them Star Fox sequences in the same level as a major boss fight? Again?
[2:48:39] <Aydarkzero> you do kind of have a blank stare atm
[2:48:40] <RyuuAoi> Did you nap?
[2:48:44] <%Bt_Robot> Eat a fish, ending. Die, ending. Wait too long in a timed sequence, ending.
[2:48:46] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Nier was always meant to be a baby game tbf, like the first Nier
[2:48:48] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[2:48:48] <penitentpendant> Man, I'm looking forward to the Disco Elysium voice acting update
[2:48:49] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> I quit a nier K ending perfect game 10/10
[2:48:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Every stream
[2:48:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[2:48:54] <@SoFarFetched> cause I think that audio set up you were doing took all your brain power
[2:48:54] <+alphonseisbest> I will DIE on the hill that is MGS RR is Plats best game
[2:48:58] <fritz_dacat> it melts faster when you play platinum games
[2:48:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> Story wise Automata is Platinum's best game. Gameplay wise? Vanquish.
[2:49:06] <ergulor> but the memes
[2:49:07] <+abrupt_abe> What is next?
[2:49:09] <+Cobaltor_252> so brain is already melted
[2:49:10] <%Daxalog> I miss being able to stay awake for 24 hrs ez.
[2:49:12] <SmolBluGhost> thats not that bad...not great...but not bad
[2:49:14] <%AzureGale> Oh ho ho

[2:49:27] <%arcielardor> How about Bravely Default?
[2:49:32] <Unibargie> so could skip V no problem
[2:49:35] <%Monkeyweed21> MGR has the best bosses but only 5 or 6 regular enemy types
[2:49:35] <Aydarkzero> oh so the angel guy is helping you out?
[2:49:36] <ShichiNoBushi> You going to continue your Resident Evil "marathon" once Paige is feeling better?
[2:49:37] <%Emperor_Machinus> Transformers Devastation?
[2:49:40] <%AzureGale> WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WAY
[2:49:42] <zipperdude33> Something something muff
[2:49:44] <%RaziWraith> What is the point on including it in a marathon when the story is an absolute mess by MGS4? LUL
[2:49:46] <Idon__> shush baldur, you played bayo 1, you know about the last mission collectables
[2:49:47] <%dasmause> play nier automata and stop at ending A
[2:49:48] <%Grimlockfly> Pat METAL GEAR MARATHON CONFIRMED.
[2:49:50] <%JD_Lars> Metal Gear marathon confirmed
[2:49:52] <marvel877> Pat, you ever get that 3DS emulator working?
[2:49:52] <Aydarkzero> that design looks stupid!
[2:49:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> oh final boss time already
[2:49:55] <+RyTYoung> THIMBLE WHAT?
[2:49:58] <%AzureGale> #fuckluca
[2:50:02] <%byuniart> Why this dude built like a triangle?
[2:50:10] <%ScreamLord> Loptr looks like such an asshole
[2:50:14] <zipperdude33> @rytyoung thimble bender
[2:50:17] <KaiserMario> Like Idiana Jones?
[2:50:19] <@commanderclaw> Looking around for shit while the world is dying reminds me of "The Trinket Ultimatum" in Tim's review of FFVII R
[2:50:23] <ergulor> god, he has a cone haircut
[2:50:26] <RyuuAoi> Persona!
[2:50:28] <dinnydanny777> If he killed Loki shouldn't he just die
[2:50:28] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> The finale feels like it comes up a lot more suddenly than 1's
[2:50:36] <penitentpendant> Poke
[2:50:41] <Aydarkzero> he went for the head PogChamp
[2:50:42] <+Delenay> ah this is why hes an adult. to trick balder
[2:50:42] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt yeah because its trite shit
[2:50:44] <%Morbidmort> Great Fuck you
[2:50:46] <+RyTYoung> @zipperdude33 feel like I didn't have that reaction when I played through this LUL
[2:50:52] <%AzureGale> Precision stab
[2:50:57] <%Ranryu692> that's what he did to Rosa's womb

[2:51:10] <RyuuAoi> Dudes bad
[2:51:18] <%Daxalog> Oh come on hes fine.
[2:51:23] <%ConLin_Arts_> I don't like this climax as much as 1's. 1's was more bombastic and epic
[2:51:24] <%SGrim> I could have dodged that, dumbass
[2:51:24] <%AzureGale> It was at that moment she knew... she fucked up
[2:51:31] <AMUSERNAME> WORF NO BibleThump
[2:51:37] <%Taisuru> He sleep
[2:51:38] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[2:51:44] <%Jrocy247> What a stupid design this guy is
[2:51:47] <%alyss988> NotLikeThis
[2:51:47] <%Blank9> now I'm just thinking about how cool that final fight was in astral chain, specifically that one that's in the core
[2:51:50] <penitentpendant> Monologuing intensifies
[2:51:50] <Profmcstevie> Super don't care pal, I'LL KILL YOU
[2:51:55] <SomersaultJustice> he divided into dumb child and stupid diamond man
[2:51:57] <Aydarkzero> Japan sure does love i've been split into two beings trope
[2:51:59] <RyuuAoi> The 3rd Eye?!
[2:52:06] <%Monkeyweed21> man I should buy Astral Chain
[2:52:09] <Idon__> what does any of this fucking mean
[2:52:14] <+balouie> bayonetta had such a cool final fight 2 not so much
[2:52:17] <dinnydanny777> Now this guy may look stupid, but his voice acting isn't terrible so
[2:52:26] <dd44dostivei> this guy seymour from ffx?
[2:52:27] <DianaTheAscian> so is this guy god?
[2:52:27] <+Delenay> EEEVIILLL
[2:52:33] <%Bt_Robot> Or like Last Crusade, where if Indiana had done nothing, Nazis would have used the Ark on Berlin in front of high command first.
[2:52:34] <+Alcamest> This game is so Sexy!
[2:52:39] <laserbeaming> EEEEVIL

[2:53:17] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:53:19] <+TopTieramisu> 2,000 point mistake

[2:53:28] <Profmcstevie> Das was weird....anyway, back to conquering
[2:53:28] <%Morbidmort> This assumes that they would have even found the things
[2:53:28] <+smuggleruncle> raiders...of diz nutz ha gotem
[2:53:29] <%Bt_Robot> It's been twenty years since I last watched it
[2:53:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> And they probably would have done it in front of an army and on TV
[2:53:32] <SCIENCE_25> Dude looks like a cool ranch Dorito
[2:53:34] <KaiserMario> Someone watched The Big Bang Theory...
[2:53:35] <RyuuAoi> Lore

[2:53:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> god I hate his hair
[2:53:52] <Idon__> I feel like every boss no selling Bayonetta's gun makes it significantly less cool hggLul
[2:53:57] <%Ranryu692> Pat would you do a Wonderful 101 playthrough? or do you dislike the wonder-liner too much?
[2:54:12] <%RaziWraith> Are his lips cold or does he wear lipstick?
[2:54:18] <RyuuAoi> DAMN
[2:54:18] <Aydarkzero> he's an eye?
[2:54:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> yeah
[2:54:28] <Idon__> LUKA?
[2:54:29] <+Arsimckhoi> guys this game is ridiculous
[2:54:30] <+oktavia_von> he looks like he should be in a ad for nord vpn
[2:54:34] <%Xevtes> in comes Dante
[2:54:34] <cloakofashes> And here's a clown.
[2:54:35] <%M4T1A5> What did he even grapple to
[2:54:35] <%Jrocy247> Man I hope Bayonetta 3 will have ACTUAL budget to make Proper cutscenes....
[2:54:36] <%Grimlockfly> journalism powers activate!
[2:54:36] <SomersaultJustice> now powerbomb the child
[2:54:38] <+Delenay> lol
[2:54:39] <%Standard_Enemy> THE MAIN CHARACTER

[2:54:49] <RyuuAoi> Wow
[2:54:49] <%Ne1son> YEAH LUKA
[2:54:52] <%BioHunter> "the fuck was that?"
[2:54:56] <%baka_sugoi> de ex
[2:54:57] <%wibbwobbler> noice
[2:54:58] <%Morbidmort> "What was that?"\
[2:54:58] <%AncelDeLambert> insects BITE, dumbass
[2:54:58] <penitentpendant> This sounds like a job for a mosquito!
[2:55:05] <%Mendin> "I think that was a space duck, sire"
[2:55:06] <+balouie> I keep wondering if bayo 3 will have actual cutscenes
[2:55:09] <SaltyAzteca> LAY UNDETECTED
[2:55:10] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt And yet gods cared enough to make the fucking things?
[2:55:11] <SCIENCE_25> Terrible Ragnaros impression
[2:55:13] <+Dova573> so what was Jubileous?
[2:55:16] <%Xevtes> OMG stop monologuing and kill him already
[2:55:19] <%AncelDeLambert> need HAMMER
[2:55:22] <%Visorak6> Is it time to attack and dethrone god?
[2:55:27] <+Cobaltor_252> I really hope Aesir is at least wearing underpants under that
[2:55:32] <%Mendin> Jubileus was the god of Paradisio, one of the Trinity of Realities
[2:55:34] <$dellakitty> Who the fuck was that Triangle Man?
[2:55:36] <RyuuAoi> Do comb
[2:55:41] <RyuuAoi> o
[2:55:43] <%Mendin> Aesir is the god of the Chaos Realm, which is the Mortal Realm
[2:55:43] <%Mahbonk> the AfterBurner stage is actually enjoyable in this game
[2:55:48] <dinnydanny777> Honestly he's pretty fricking lame ngl
[2:55:51] <%Mendin> *(which -became- the Mortal Realm
[2:55:52] <%Monkeyweed21> its no Lumen Sage or Jeanne
[2:55:54] <Aydarkzero> sounds like Armored Xemnas
[2:55:56] <%Taisuru> Well you can fight any boss is Tag Climax
[2:55:58] <%Morbidmort> Platinum needs to start adding boss rushes
[2:55:59] <purple_bagel> This afterburner stage is good tho
[2:56:06] <%AncelDeLambert> ew, he's using the chainsaws
[2:56:06] <Vcom7418> @AncelDeLambert Just once, I wants someone, fighting a god who says: "I don't care about machinations of insects" is for someone to shoot hellfire at them or whatever and say: "Insects are poisonous, you idiot"
[2:56:06] <braincraft> Triangle Man hates Person Man.
[2:56:11] <penitentpendant> And yet again, your best strategy for this boss is to Dodge Fish
[2:56:13] <dinnydanny777> Baldur throws buildings at you and this guy has big hands
[2:56:14] <bettysharkface> Just a naked dude wearing a tablecloth
[2:56:19] <%Mahbonk> Bayo 1 afterburner though...never again
[2:56:20] <%RaziWraith> Slam that cool ranch Dorito LUL
[2:56:21] <thwak> there's also the whole thing of bayonetta 2 allows you to use items with out losing rating so people just cheese this boss anyway
[2:56:23] <%Monkeyweed21> MGR and Astral Chain let you just skip to the bosses
[2:56:30] <RyuuAoi> Gud song
[2:56:32] <%ConLin_Arts_> I still wonder, did all of the super gods share the eyes between themselves or are they just Aesirs? Because why did Jubileus need them?
[2:56:33] <KaiserMario> Platinum's best bosses of all are still Jetstream Sam and Senator Armstrong
[2:56:44] <%Mahbonk> just let me listen to 1 more hour of Balder's long ass speeches instead of playing schut ever again
[2:56:49] <%Jrocy247> I
[2:56:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Sup Fucker? Shout out from just outside LaFleche. Fun Fact; a LaFleche Donut is a piece of bread toasted and buttered on both sides with sugar sprinkled on each side.
[2:56:52] <+alphonseisbest> &
[2:56:53] <$dellakitty> He's Triangle Man now
[2:57:00] <%Jrocy247> I'd say Mansoon is pretty good too
[2:57:11] <%Daxalog> Oh
[2:57:14] <%Mendin> Jubileus existed before All Creation was split into 3 and kinda went into a coma when they were sundered. Aesir formed in Chaos after the sundering
[2:57:15] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> rip
[2:57:15] <dinnydanny777> What an easy boss
[2:57:17] <%Mahbonk> chain summon
[2:57:19] <RyuuAoi> Cake
[2:57:31] <dinnydanny777> Oh you lost in the cutscene again
[2:57:39] <$RealThiele> hey if she summons all her contract demons
[2:57:49] <bettysharkface> His hand is as big as his fucking head
[2:57:49] <+TopTieramisu> not enough resolve, i guess
[2:57:50] <%Xevtes> this is terrible shit
[2:57:51] <+smuggleruncle> is that guy inside his gamer cube
[2:57:51] <%AncelDeLambert> no but he was just playing, tho
[2:57:53] <+Pharmakokinetic> the spectacle of the end fight is pretty good but it is rather unremarkabler
[2:57:54] <+fetrigon> What's so easy about nier automata?
[2:57:55] <%Blank9> he wants it more
[2:57:56] <%Mendin> The Eyes were meant to use god-juice to wake up Jubileus in Mortal Realm which would let her smash Paradisio into it and reunite reality
[2:57:56] <%ConLin_Arts_> it's like he's a bad villain
[2:58:01] <PanicSwytch> Is he just a Jojo character
[2:58:04] <%Taisuru> He stole her cool-aid!
[2:58:04] <%Daxalog> okay so he won
[2:58:05] <Aydarkzero> wait again?
[2:58:08] <RyuuAoi> Bad end
[2:58:10] <%LaughingCatt> I really hate the "Win the gameplay battle, lose in cutscene" crap.
[2:58:11] <marvel877> Now HE has the Reality Stone!
[2:58:12] <$dellakitty> Triangle Man has crack smoking lips
[2:58:13] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> bayo loses to nearly everyone in this it's weird
[2:58:13] <%RaziWraith> butt shot LUL
[2:58:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Summon all your hair to make Jehct

[2:58:28] <%BTR_NOODLE> super geometry man!
[2:58:28] <Vcom7418> He legit sounds like a character from ProZD's parody series
[2:58:30] <cloakofashes> Sir, you look ridiculous.
[2:58:30] <Laecerelius> Look at this dumb looking fuck
[2:58:32] <+BlackJack607> Look at galactic douchebag overhere.

[2:58:57] <+mashinchaserr> free will is a myth
[2:59:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Only cool to Japanases developer look

[3:00:00] <%Taisuru> He was napping remember
[3:00:02] <%BioHunter> cause baulder was knocked out
[3:00:05] <%Mendin> Baldur tanked that exploding laser and needed a breather
[3:00:06] <Vcom7418> Cause Balder needed a break
[3:00:06] <bettysharkface> Oh yeah, Primordial Chaos from Hades is fucking dope as hell. This guy is way too symmetrical to be chaos.
[3:00:06] <%RaziWraith> cuz he was tired. don't worry about it. :)
[3:00:09] <DrkJP520> Baldur was unconscious, keep up
[3:00:09] <%ssjklyco> this would be a good secret multiplayer
[3:00:11] <AMUSERNAME> Now he's just WAY SHORTER LUL
[3:00:12] <%ConLin_Arts_> when I played this the Hammer just melted him and he was no challenge at all
[3:00:13] <%AzureGale> THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING
[3:00:13] <Noogiez> magic
[3:00:14] <$RealThiele> goku logicbecause they wanted him to power up
[3:00:16] <%TheQuadrupleS> Well that wouldn't be very sporting would it
[3:00:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Because "reasons"
[3:00:19] <RyuuAoi> Plot
[3:00:21] <penitentpendant> I do like that "Witch Time" works for allies instead of slowing them down too
[3:00:33] <fritz_dacat> balder wanted to se his moveset first
[3:00:34] <+TheotherKristian> there is a reason...probably
[3:00:39] <RyuuAoi> Woof
[3:00:39] <%ssjklyco> Time for 2nd try Pat to show up
[3:00:44] <+smuggleruncle> oh boy
[3:00:45] <%Mendin> Aesir is the God of (ruling/ordering) Chaos, vs the god of (the aspect of/embodying) Chaos
[3:00:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is VERY good at this game
[3:00:47] <%kewlmyc> THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[3:00:47] <@SoFarFetched> LUL pat you were clearly in it
[3:00:50] <marvel877> PERFECT
[3:00:50] <%AzureGale> ded
[3:00:51] <+titansloth93> I cast SUMMON BOMBERS
[3:00:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> GG NO Re
[3:00:52] <+Pharmakokinetic> Aesir launching.... human creations to fight you makes no sense
[3:00:52] <Profmcstevie> Death by WW2
[3:00:54] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:00:55] <HairballCT> balder actively dragged you down LUL
[3:00:59] <braincraft> Stand in the circles, I think they're powerups.
[3:01:04] <%barkon345> why are all of these characters named after Norse gods in a game about Heaven and Hell?
[3:01:07] <laserbeaming> Afterburner is the True Final Boss
[3:01:18] <marvel877> Pat hates Afterburner, confirmed.
[3:01:22] <%Taisuru> Just do Tag Climax
[3:01:22] <%Xevtes> @barkon345 because weeb
[3:01:25] <%Mendin> @barkon345 Japan loves slamming mythologies together for videogames
[3:01:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> to be fair Jubileus has the Jeanne bit
[3:01:32] <$Raikouija> At least it’s a better version of afterburner
[3:01:33] <penitentpendant> @laserbeaming At least in DMC1
[3:01:39] <%Xevtes> @barkon345 *weeb stuff, sorry
[3:01:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just stop taking hits Kappa

[3:03:07] <$Raikouija> Now fly
[3:03:10] <%Taisuru> I hate ALL these fucking Loptr fights
[3:03:10] <@commanderclaw> This is some serious framerate dimension shit

[3:03:20] <%Romuken> should i wait for the vod?
[3:03:26] <Idon__> uhhh everything
[3:03:31] <marvel877> Like that one fight in Transformers: Devastation.
[3:03:33] <%Taisuru> @Romuken Yes
[3:03:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> What is a health bar? Just this thing we made to fuck with you, honestly.
[3:03:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> also isn't the laser the same one as in W101?
[3:03:40] <%Romuken> fudgre
[3:03:44] <shotgang86> I remember that I was disappointed by this fight because it is nothing close as epic as Jubileus
[3:03:45] <+fetrigon> Or maybe related light elf and dark elf realms.
[3:03:53] <kinggum41> is that the fucking shirogane comet
[3:03:57] <%ConLin_Arts_> No there
[3:03:58] <RyuuAoi> Trippy

[3:04:19] <%Monkeyweed21> thats totally the shirogane comet
[3:04:20] <DianaTheAscian> its a colony?
[3:04:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> As i'm learning more coding from a game making perspective, games are fucking stupid busllshit that shouldn't make money
[3:04:25] <Vcom7418> This really needed another 2 0s to truly be impressive
[3:04:26] <@SoFarFetched> Almost did a colony drop on you
[3:04:29] <+Over_ninek> clearly that was Side 3 from 0079
[3:04:31] <%Xevtes> that was something
[3:04:36] <%Mendin> That was a comet-sized Ultra Space Laser
[3:04:39] <%Mendin> from W101
[3:04:41] <penitentpendant> And Baldur's disappeared again
[3:04:43] <DrkJP520> I wish Wonder Red would show up right now.
[3:04:44] <%Jekado> SUCK IT AUSTRAIL... wait...
[3:04:45] <therealritzreal> Thic Thighs Save Lives duh
[3:04:58] <%Daxalog> This is the last boss?
[3:04:58] <Vcom7418> Wait this is the final boss?!
[3:05:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> But engines are insane and deserve the money their creatotrs earned
[3:05:01] <puse9> he is so underwhelming
[3:05:01] <shotgang86> he sucks so much
[3:05:02] <%M4T1A5> @ChrisPlaysThing Don't worry it's all software
[3:05:06] <Zayasu> shity air combat ResidentSleeper
[3:05:07] <xxshadowxx416> @chrisplaysthing make haha what art make money
[3:05:09] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Balder's fight was a lot cooler
[3:05:13] <+fetrigon> BUT LASER SPACE COLONY THO
[3:05:13] <%Taisuru> He sucks
[3:05:15] <%Jrocy247> Why is he throwing Satellites and shit at you like that's supposed to work? LUL
[3:05:19] <+Over_ninek> it aint good
[3:05:20] <puse9> I hope bayo 3 has a better final boss
[3:05:20] <+balouie> I just prefer bayo 1s boss
[3:05:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> and Jubileus had better music
[3:05:23] <%ssjklyco> You can't beat Riding a motorcyle into space on a rocket ship to punch god into the sun from the first game.
[3:05:24] <%charp35> It's so lame for a final boss
[3:05:30] <+balouie> it seems more epic
[3:05:31] <AMUSERNAME> But CHIRAL SYMMETRY, PAT LUL
[3:05:32] <NitronStreams> Loptr is such a step down it hurts
[3:05:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah the Jubelieus one was better
[3:05:37] <dinnydanny777> He's so boring
[3:05:37] <marvel877> Its a Nintendo game, of course it has hands as a boss fight!
[3:05:37] <%LaughingCatt> Also why is the all powerful God of Chaos just... throwing missiles & stuff at you
[3:05:40] <@commanderclaw> "I have the power of a god! I will now fight like Bongo Bongo in OoT"
[3:05:45] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Troubled development fo sho
[3:05:49] <+smuggleruncle> design is pretty lame

[3:10:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> I really hope Bayo 3 is the best parts of these two games
[3:10:25] <shadowstreakXIII> No it didn't
[3:10:25] <Shardlab> He keeps doing it over and over even when he gets killed by his own kid?

[3:10:29] <xxshadowxx416> what
[3:10:30] <$RealThiele> DADDY
[3:10:32] <%LaughingCatt> It aged poorly through no fault of its own
[3:10:33] <%Blank9> his song name is Call Me Father though
[3:10:34] <OswaldTheDog> Maannn this aged so poorly
[3:10:34] <fritz_dacat> why not PaPa
[3:10:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> That word is bad taste now
[3:10:35] <%Mahbonk> like fine spoiled milk
[3:10:35] <+PkSilent01> Daddy was sweet back then, Now its Daddy<3
[3:10:35] <%byuniart> She calls Jeane Mummy later

[3:10:43] <Gelphaze> OH DADDY!!
[3:10:44] <DrkJP520> Yeah, people got creepier
[3:10:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean Baldur is daddy tho
[3:10:45] <%kyh9> The non sexual daddy
[3:10:46] <%Visorak6> Its probably because she uses "mummy", father would be strange
[3:10:46] <%AkronymCLT> To be fair it's weird for an adult to refer to their parent as Mummy or Daddy regardless
[3:10:50] <@commanderclaw> Can Yoko Taro just write all of Platinum's games from now on?
[3:10:52] <%charp35> I hope bayo 3 can have a good final boss
[3:10:52] <%Mendin> Wait yeah that created a plot hole
[3:10:53] <%Ranryu692> @Puhff time travel is involved. that was a time portal he got dragged into
[3:10:54] <%Deft_Thought> Loki looks weird here
[3:10:57] <+alphonseisbest> no Daddy has always had that connotation
[3:10:57] <%Grimlockfly> Git Daddyed SeemsGood500
[3:10:57] <jorniev> FATHE- NO CALL ME DADDY
[3:11:00] <%Mahbonk> They really missed the opportunity to just make him say You may call me Father
[3:11:01] <%Taisuru> I hope bayo 3 is just more plot fixing :V
[3:11:03] <kinggum41> GEE CANT WAIT FOR BAYO 3
[3:11:05] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah it's pretty short when you're not grinding the fuck out of halos
[3:11:09] <KaiserMario> It's cause you're so goos
[3:11:11] <%ConLin_Arts_> Just have bayo fight Armstrong in 3
[3:11:14] <@SoFarFetched> IN BAYO 3
[3:11:15] <$Raikouija> I believe the eyes still exist in the past which is why he gets it
[3:11:16] <dinnydanny777> oh thank god the child is going away PogChamp
[3:11:17] <%Jrocy247> God I hope not
[3:11:18] <$RealThiele> time for metal gear RR
[3:11:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Even back then I thought it was funny she called him daddy LUL
[3:11:27] <dinnydanny777> Don't let him come back please NotLikeThis
[3:11:28] <RyuuAoi> Play something else?
[3:11:31] <@SoFarFetched> loki confirming himself for Bayo 3
[3:11:39] <marvel877> ...grooming?
[3:11:39] <%ssjklyco> And you get rid of those corn rows
[3:11:41] <penitentpendant> Plot twist, Loki becomes playable in 3. People groan.
[3:11:41] <%Morbidmort> It was always weird
[3:11:48] <$Raikouija> Hopefully Bayo 3 fixes the gameplay problems in Bayo 2 like combo breaking
[3:11:49] <%baka_sugoi> better have a dule dick in 3
[3:11:49] <%Deft_Thought> Better change that damn haircut when you grow up
[3:11:51] <%ConLin_Arts_> HE will be the main character of 3
[3:11:51] <%Puhff> Wow loki's accent is so bad
[3:11:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Keep Loki away forever please
[3:11:53] <kinggum41> Bayo created a fetish in him that day
[3:11:54] <%baka_sugoi> disk
[3:11:55] <PaPaSeppuku> DATS SOME BIG ASS PANTS
[3:11:55] <%Grimlockfly> how about that Bayo 3 Loki glow up, huh?
[3:11:55] <therealritzreal> yugi boy
[3:11:56] <%Standard_Enemy> Dude loki being playable in 3 is super plausible
[3:11:56] <%Blank9> he wants to be luka
[3:11:57] <cloakofashes> "A dork in a silly hat."
[3:11:57] <Saltmeisterr> Pat i watched both lps. i do not understand
[3:11:58] <%arancet> i want to be a cube when i grow up mummy
[3:11:58] <+FunStuffAvenue> @penitentpendant but he was already playable Kappa
[3:11:58] <%Deft_Thought> None of that weird triangle head shit
[3:12:00] <%kyh9> IM GOING TO BE THE KING OF GAMES
[3:12:01] <%ScreamLord> Said the creator god of the universe
[3:12:05] <+Cobaltor_252> so when does Loki get possessed by an Egyptian god and start playing cards
[3:12:06] <%weissguard> So Bayo and Balder together summoned Omne.
[3:12:08] <%Mendin> @penitentpendant I mean if he plays like a character action game Twisted Fate (from LoL) that woldb e cool
[3:12:10] <%LaughingCatt> now more nonsensical time fuckery
[3:12:13] <%baronblank> I feel like loki being playable in bayo 3 with the arms seems very plausible
[3:12:14] <%MechArch> ded
[3:12:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> At least i know i want to grow up penisey
[3:12:17] <%ConLin_Arts_> reincarnated as a babby
[3:12:21] <ShichiNoBushi> She already offered him to call her "Bayonetta" or "Cereza".
[3:12:21] <+FunStuffAvenue> he's fine

[3:12:31] <PaPaSeppuku> child death
[3:12:34] <SCIENCE_25> I mean, he's a god tho
[3:12:34] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Reincarnation's a thing, I guess
[3:12:36] <dinnydanny777> When a heartless and a nobody die the human form returns Kappa
[3:12:37] <%AkronymCLT> He's Bayo's Uub
[3:12:38] <+FunStuffAvenue> he just ctrl+z's his death

[3:12:43] <%AXL808> it's now New Years
[3:12:43] <krin_x> in a game about magic
[3:12:44] <%Emperor_Machinus> He did the reincarnation thing his evil half tried to do
[3:12:46] <+Over_ninek> if the other half was gonna run off and try again it would reason that Loki is just doing that too
[3:12:46] <@commanderclaw> When will they let Bayo and Jeanne kiss?
[3:12:47] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Chrimbo

[3:17:39] <+fetrigon> Pat play Bayo 3 now FeelsGoodMan
[3:17:39] <%RetroCop87> not DMCA?
[3:17:41] <%LaughingCatt> Bayo comes out the same day as Half-Life 3 lobosKek
[3:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> mmmmmmmMummy
[3:17:48] <+pajamarammaslamma> Transformers Devastation is Bayo 3
[3:17:50] <Vcom7418> Man I thought Aesir was like Balder last game - fake final boss before summoning the real one. What a disappointment
[3:17:54] <%Jrocy247> @PatStaresAt So legitamite question to you, Are Bayonetta's story even good to you?
[3:17:57] <%ssjklyco> Bayos Mother Woke up to Justice
[3:17:57] <+Alcamest> lol
[3:18:09] <kinggum41> I wonder how bayo 3 is doing
[3:18:10] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:18:14] <therealritzreal> you mean halfl ife 4
[3:18:15] <jorniev> YUP
[3:18:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, why so serious?
[3:18:16] <%AzureGale> lol
[3:18:18] <@SoFarFetched> pretty much

[3:18:18] <$RealThiele> end boss is triangle man
[3:18:18] <SCIENCE_25> and that's okay.
[3:18:24] <%Taisuru> Bayo story is bad but fun
[3:18:25] <%arancet> who cares about it? its like caring about marios story
[3:18:26] <%StebTheVee> So Platiunum Games in a nutchell
[3:18:27] <%Morbidmort> Bayo's parents woke up to Sex
[3:18:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I got nothing, i'm hoping to make 5.1 million in the next 5 yars. If i'm lucky with my nonsense
[3:18:29] <%Jrocy247> LUL
[3:18:29] <DianaTheAscian> whats bayo 3?
[3:18:29] <$Raikouija> Story is so bad it’s good!
[3:18:32] <+FunStuffAvenue> @ssjklyco Balder woke up to witch pussy
[3:18:35] <%bigbrothergannon> bigbrothergannon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months in the orb lets go!
[3:18:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I take pats opinion with a pound of salt
[3:18:38] <Idon__> Pat has been endlessly roasting this story all playthrough lol
[3:18:41] <NitronStreams> is it even possible for bayo3 to have a good story?
[3:18:42] <DrkJP520> the music sipsipGasm
[3:18:43] <%Ghufufin> seems like a lot of things were sacrificed for spectacle and style
[3:18:43] <Vcom7418> So in the end, does the story in a spectacle fighter need to be anything more? I know it can be more via DMC, but does it need to be? @PatStaresAt
[3:18:43] <Profmcstevie> Underneath the goof of Bayonetta is a nonsense story that facilitates gameplay and gameplay alone. Underneath the goof of Devil May Cry is a constant story of family and the characters struggles with it.
[3:18:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> years, phooey
[3:18:49] <Gelphaze> Dance pat!
[3:18:57] <+FunStuffAvenue> @NitronStreams it's possible but it shouldn't

[3:19:21] <%Emperor_Machinus> Was his name-o?
[3:19:27] <%AkronymCLT> That's the same guy who did DMC5
[3:19:28] <+Alcamest> No one plays Bayo for the story, they play for the plot!
[3:19:29] <+FunStuffAvenue> love seeing madama butterfly
[3:19:31] <+TheotherKristian> So where is Bayonetta on the Platinum Games tier list?

[3:22:39] <+whiskywolfe> I told you
[3:22:40] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bayo 2 feels better to play
[3:22:40] <%vexion_smh> ABSOLUTELY
[3:22:42] <Shardlab> Yeah no. We gotta disagree on that one
[3:22:42] <+TheotherKristian> 1 = 2
[3:22:43] <%DEETRz> jean long hair in 2 tho
[3:22:44] <%Monkeyweed21> did you forget about the awful level design
[3:22:45] <%StebTheVee> debatable
[3:22:45] <%Maids4lyfe> I don't like the QtEs in Bayo 1
[3:22:45] <%JD_Lars> Incorrect
[3:22:47] <thwak> it's not even close how much better it is
[3:22:48] <jorniev> ITS STILL GOOD AT LEAST
[3:22:49] <%Taisuru> Bayo 2 is better but WAY worse climax
[3:22:50] <%RetroCop87> Smash Bros Ultimate is a better Bayo sequel
[3:22:50] <laserbeaming> I like the weapons in 2 more, but yeah 1 is better
[3:22:50] <%dasmause> bayo 2 has better weapons too
[3:22:51] <%kyh9> I like Bayo 2 weapons more
[3:22:52] <+Alcamest> Bayo 2 Tried to do too much!
[3:22:53] <+Over_ninek> it also has cool Baldur
[3:22:54] <bettysharkface> Aw Plague posted a cute photo wearing glasses on twitter
[3:22:56] <redial_nick> full circle
[3:22:58] <allyalice> bayo2 has some improvements but overall yeah. 1 plays so much better
[3:22:59] <ShichiNoBushi> What do you expect the Bayo 3 story to be about, and what about 1 and 2 do you expect the story will retcon?
[3:23:02] <+Pharmakokinetic> Bayo 1 and Bayo 2 look like they are the same game but they're both better at such different things
[3:23:02] <%seanaramicus> Bayo 2 combat feels a lot better to me
[3:23:02] <%StebTheVee> storywise, bayo 1 is better
[3:23:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> DMC3>>Bayo1>B2
[3:23:05] <%cafefunk> Story wise bayo is better, but Bayo 2 combat is better
[3:23:06] <%baka_sugoi> rip
[3:23:06] <penitentpendant> Fighting your own Nostalgia sucks
[3:23:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah Bayo 2 is totally better. Both are good tho, you do you
[3:23:10] <dinnydanny777> but short hair
[3:23:12] <%Nobrev> pat sticking to the "Always wrong" gimmick
[3:23:12] <%Monkeyweed21> better weapons, better level design, better secret missions
[3:23:13] <$Raikouija> @patstaresat funny thing you say that pat, the HARDCORE PUre Platinum YouTubers that broke Bayo 1 down all agree
[3:23:13] <%arancet> eh youre just being overly dramatic
[3:23:14] <NitronStreams> that ending really just lets it down
[3:23:14] <%kyh9> Many fewer pure combat sections in Bayo 2, but the combat is great
[3:23:15] <+TheotherKristian> Can't wait for the Woolie salt
[3:23:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Daddy part aged like milk
[3:23:16] <+Alcamest> The Weapon are more fun, like the hammer!
[3:23:17] <%weissguard> 1 and 2 excel in different areas. But frankly, 1 is better for the areas it excels in vs the areas 2 excels in for me.
[3:23:17] <%zeroarturia> I still hate the qtes in Bayo 1
[3:23:19] <%JD_Lars> Nope
[3:23:19] <+whiskywolfe> Put Bayo 2’s mechanics in Bayo 1’s everything else
[3:23:19] <Elsewize> Is there a Bayo 3?
[3:23:21] <PanicSwytch> Watch the MH vod if u want to know how Pat has 2 demos
[3:23:21] <%Ranryu692> Woolie is gonna be so mad
[3:23:22] <%tri3dgE027> Bayo 1 had the better Final Boss build-up, but Bayo 2 has the better gameplay
[3:23:24] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean ramble?
[3:23:25] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:23:25] <%vexion_smh> I'm glad pat finally realized his true potential
[3:23:26] <%Nekros4442> Yep
[3:23:26] <Vyneci> YEP
[3:23:31] <Aydarkzero> usually the 2nd game is better
[3:23:31] <Idon__> LMFAO
[3:23:31] <marvel877> Yep.
[3:23:32] <%Nekros4442> Thats exactly how that's convo is gonna go
[3:23:33] <OswaldTheDog> Bayonetta loves her Daddy
[3:23:33] <Zayasu> and people to be angry for you to dislike something LUL
[3:23:33] <%snackcanary> Not gonna touch them trials and multiplayer unlocks, eh? Same
[3:23:33] <%rekinom> Yeah
[3:23:34] <%ssjklyco> The endiong with Balder seems to be the Vergil fighting Mundus at the end of 3 SE
[3:23:35] <shotgang86> goddamnit woolz
[3:23:35] <shadowstreakXIII> yea...
[3:23:38] <%BogBodyPositive> hahahaha
[3:23:40] <%AXL808> incredible impersonation of Wollie
[3:23:40] <TheNewJapanGuy> This weeks bad take is...
[3:23:41] <%MisterRockett> It's almost as if the podcast needs more people xD
[3:23:41] <jorniev> NOW I REALLY WONDER WHAT BAYO 3 IS GONNA BE
[3:23:41] <RushUnplugged> "agree to disagree"
[3:23:42] <%Visorak6> Just give us a look when it happens
[3:23:44] <%AXL808> Woolie
[3:23:44] <+Caidezes> Woolie never remembers.
[3:23:45] <Shardlab> So don't bring it up until Woolie does it
[3:23:46] <+Over_ninek> i'd probably side with woolie; it's a good sort of trashfire
[3:23:48] <%baronblank> that sounds about right yea
[3:23:49] <%Blank9> wait until 2026 when you replay astral chain and it finally holds up
[3:23:49] <ReRe0183> assbackwards
[3:23:51] <penitentpendant> Now, what Nostalgia to ruin next?
[3:23:52] <%Plus_On_Black> He be like that, he loves his video games.
[3:23:54] <@SoFarFetched> Pat be careful your brain is leaking out
[3:23:57] <%Ghufufin> talking with woolie seems like it swings wildlly from incredibly intersting to wildly frustrating
[3:23:57] <%BogBodyPositive> you ok?
[3:23:59] <%StebTheVee> Bayo 2 is just explaing a retcon
[3:24:00] <RyuuAoi> Leave Woolie alone!
[3:24:00] <$Raikouija> I hope to god that Bayo 3 is better than Bayo 1
[3:24:00] <Shardlab> You know it's gonna be dust in the wind
[3:24:04] <marvel877> Woolie must have an ironclad memory to never want to replay games, OH NO WAIT HE DOES NOT.
[3:24:08] <+kullumanati> The quality we’ve all come to expect
[3:24:09] <OswaldTheDog> oh my god you look so upset
[3:24:11] <%Jrocy247> Man Bayo 2 made you tired...
[3:24:13] <%Ranryu692> the worst part of him doing that with Bayo 1 is that he played it in 2019
[3:24:13] <+TheotherKristian> Yes
[3:24:13] <+JustToWatch> YES
[3:24:13] <+TopTieramisu> yes

[3:24:25] <+kullumanati> Yes
[3:24:26] <%Tenebrae94> yes
[3:24:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> "Am I a massive asshole"
[3:24:27] <%Hiro01231> which convo
[3:24:27] <Profmcstevie> Could I get a summary
[3:24:27] <+kullumanati> 1
[3:24:27] <%Blank9> it's such a short game too
[3:24:28] <RyuuAoi> Trash
[3:24:28] <%snackcanary> alittle
[3:24:28] <+transporterthesequel> Yes, but it's literally the reason why you own a home right now.
[3:24:29] <dan_g_v> what transistor?
[3:24:30] <%Nekros4442> Yes but thats expected
[3:24:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> Transistor conversation?
[3:24:30] <kinggum41> I just can't get over bayo 1 looking like trash
[3:24:31] <OswaldTheDog> Ah
[3:24:32] <%DEETRz> jts a little petty
[3:24:32] <marvel877> Little bit.
[3:24:33] <+fetrigon> hm
[3:24:34] <AMUSERNAME> It's understandable, but PETTY.
[3:24:34] <%AXL808> Woolie has CROSSED THE LINE
[3:24:35] <seaechiowai> yes but that's your character at this point
[3:24:36] <jorniev> definetly an asshole
[3:24:36] <ReRe0183> no
[3:24:38] <Noogiez> we FORGIVE you tho
[3:24:38] <RyuuAoi> Yes
[3:24:39] <HairballCT> "am i a massive asshole-" gonna stop you there, yes you are LUL
[3:24:39] <+TheotherKristian> Is Pat the asshole, huh?
[3:24:42] <penitentpendant> Yes, but you're also not wrong?
[3:24:43] <%Plus_On_Black> No, you was right.
[3:24:45] <dariusclover> Nah man
[3:24:46] <Gelphaze> Half and HAlf.
[3:24:46] <%rekinom> Just play through transistor again woole it'll only take an hour
[3:24:48] <+RyTYoung> PAT YOU HAVE A STEVE BUSCEMI POSTER
[3:24:49] <%king_wragles> Wait, what about Transistor?
[3:24:49] <@SoFarFetched> Woolie: Transistor is my all time favorite game but I forgot how it ended.
[3:24:51] <%MisterRockett> Woolie has been kinda bad about having compelling debates
[3:24:51] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Woolie's memory being trash isn't your fault
[3:24:51] <shotgang86> of ALL THINGS TRANSISTOR?
[3:24:57] <RyuuAoi> Yea._.
[3:24:57] <%kyh9> It is very funny that Woolie remembers aesthetic more than actual details or experiences
[3:24:58] <Vyneci> Alright Pat, tell me: how does Balder use the power of the Right Eye to awaken Jubileus in the first game if by that point he doesn't have it because it was erased?
[3:25:02] <bettysharkface> I used to adore Transistor, but then Disco Elysium happened.
[3:25:02] <Vcom7418> cya pat
[3:25:03] <Aydarkzero> @SoFarFetched lmao
[3:25:05] <$StrawberryPantsu> Transistor is fucking mid though tbh
[3:25:06] <Profmcstevie> Can I get a cliffnotes on the Transistor thing, did Pat hold Woolie accountable
[3:25:08] <jorniev> HE LIKES THE GAME THATS THE END OF IT
[3:25:10] <dan_g_v> time to start Astra Chain then
[3:25:12] <%vexion_smh> woof woof
[3:25:12] <AMUSERNAME> Transistor AESTHETIC is excellent though.

[3:28:31] <%Plesin> Tbh bayo 2 is good gameplaywise but the story definitely cripples it in comparison to dmc3, same with some of the forced arbitrary extra sections like the dumb jet plane.
[3:28:33] <%ssjklyco> It wasn't a hair raising flavor
