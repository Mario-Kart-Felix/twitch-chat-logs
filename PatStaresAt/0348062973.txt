[0:24:47] <echodrone81> build an environment.
[0:24:48] <+heroicspiritavenger> @plagueofgripes I'm fairly sure most of the year, doing so would mean that it freezes mid-stream causing both death below and freezing a frozen strand to your pecker
[0:25:00] <%happyface699> @fujiwara_92 Why would you ask
[0:25:02] <marvinbrewton25> pat is that diet redbull?
[0:25:04] <jaygee303> Focus and give it consequence
[0:25:05] <gmmoshupisbae> 4 or 3
[0:25:06] <BrachyZoid> Going to sleep would be a shown of weakness, forcing Page and Elmo to eat Pat's heart
[0:25:08] <HentaiSenpai9K> @fujiwara_92 Because he has no life 😂
[0:25:10] <$RubberFistFight> @heroicspiritavenger jeez imagine being speared to death by a frozen pee stream

[0:25:54] <the_mental_punk> @angriestpat thank you!
[0:25:59] <$RubberFistFight> @Goldenwolf98 only if you then make sure to defraud millions of customers, offer them piss-all as compensation, and then leak all their data.
[0:26:03] <Caidezes> The singer was on point but the mixing was awful.
[0:26:04] <gmmoshupisbae> you wanted it
[0:26:04] <mercado94> speaking of fallout. 76 has to be a organized joke, i cant believe how much they"re fucking up
[0:26:04] <gimmickypizza> Sound mixing sucked
[0:26:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> the Smash AI for new challengers is completely out of hand with the input reading

[0:27:09] <longrat> that bazelgeuse shirt is perfect
[0:27:09] <$RubberFistFight> @Goldenwolf98 that was the "defrauding millions of customers" thing - it was literally fraud. They promised one thing to get sales, then delivered something else entirely. In several countries it was outright fraud, and in many others it was blatant misrepresentation at LEAST.
[0:27:12] <jaygee303> I’m on tv!!!!!
[0:27:13] <+spiegelspike> @AngriestPat is that a note, or just a regular samsung that looks huge in your hands

[0:27:46] <Goldenwolf98> @RubberFistFight oh I thought you meant the game in general Kappa
[0:27:48] <jaygee303> This is the calmest you’ve ever been Pat
[0:27:48] <+heroicspiritavenger> @angriestpat "Devil Trigger" has a ton of post-processing on the male vocalist, which is why it sounded off. Meanwhile, the female vocals have significantly less, and thus her natural raw vocals worked.
[0:27:50] <%mandragoraroot> pat has never been ok
[0:27:50] <Apolonm> ASMR?
[0:27:51] <zaptar13> "I can see all of you"-Pat

[0:29:59] <axelcezar> jesus fuck that level of sound made me jump
[0:30:01] <ChillTonic> She probably never looked you in the eyes due to her gaze being locked onto your ogre bulge.
[0:30:03] <MZess> I'm gonna be honest though Pat, I don't look anyone in the eyes, I couldn't tell you the eye color of anyone I know
[0:30:07] <TyrantSlime> It needed to be changed for the game awards

[0:31:35] <Daniel_Is_I> What color were her eyes, Pat?
[0:31:40] <Run44forrest> pat slept early
[0:31:40] <%Chichen> its hard to look you in the eyes when you have to look down
[0:31:43] <vapelad_dabberb01> it's late
[0:31:45] <BrachyZoid> koboldLul
[0:31:46] <+Rakharian> I can't even tell what color eyes my mothers are
[0:31:47] <axelcezar> that is how it works when they see you are not a possible mate
[0:31:48] <gmmoshupisbae> friendship over
[0:31:48] <MegboyManuel> someone clip those eyes
[0:31:50] <%mandragoraroot> what colour are my eyes pat :)
[0:31:52] <jack_s1n> what colour was her eyes huh?
[0:31:57] <echodrone81> she was eyeballing your massive dong through your grey sweatpants
[0:31:58] <gazdropish> tbf your eyes are small
[0:32:01] <Fujiwara_92> you're to small for her to look in your eyes
[0:32:04] <%elclintonio> i mean you can look someone in the eyes without noticing the color
[0:32:07] <+axebird> I don't remember anyone's eye color, even making eye contact. Just not a thing I note
[0:32:10] <efratzy> it means she finally respects you enough to look in your eyes
[0:32:12] <longrat> god damn i wish i could stream to people who like watching me play the vidya instead of having to work for a living
[0:32:13] <zaptar13> No I refuse
[0:32:13] <%mandragoraroot> no
[0:32:15] <grayjammer> FUCK YOU I REFUSE TO EYECONTACT
[0:32:17] <testarossa2007> wind resistant
[0:32:19] <+silvereco19> maybe she had autism?
[0:32:20] <+Kongro_> I'd be surprised to see a blue eyed basketball too, to be fair.
[0:32:21] <GyroBigHugs> Making eye contact is hard for a lot of people
[0:32:23] <Daniel_Is_I> I make eye contact but I don't internalize eye color. I barely remember what color my brother's eyes are.
[0:32:23] <gazdropish> @longrat same
[0:32:24] <%Dragonfang1337> PATRICK WHAT WHY 6 AM
[0:32:26] <gmmoshupisbae> she couldn't see you from all the way down there
[0:32:27] <Jontman42> Making eyecontact doesn't mean I pay attention to their eyecolor though
[0:32:27] <ValidVenasaur> no thats super weird if you look them in the eye all the time
[0:32:27] <%Taisuru> I make eye contact with people and couldn't tell you my best friends eye color
[0:32:30] <Who_lio42> they just figured itd be brown cause youre full of shit more of the time
[0:32:31] <$Yum438> eye contact freaks me out
[0:32:37] <%Chichen> i dont remember ANYONES eye color
[0:32:38] <RantingRavager> What the fuck are you doing up? It's 7AM
[0:32:39] <MegboyManuel> eye contact means sexy times, christian stream
[0:32:44] <%happyface699> I WILL NOT LOSE MY SOUL TO EYES
[0:32:44] <+heroicspiritavenger> @angriestpat had you never considered that maybe she had feelings for you, and thus felt awkward making eye contact with you due to shyness?
[0:32:45] <$Dutchpotato> Games still a little loud
[0:32:46] <%BioApple> I could not tell you the eye color of anyone I'm living with right now even though I've probably looked at them a thousand times each
[0:32:46] <gmmoshupisbae> eye contact is gross
[0:32:47] <swansong118> Its to Establish Dominance!
[0:32:48] <%mandragoraroot> jermaPluto
[0:32:49] <Fujiwara_92> tip for never breaking eye contact: never make eye contact
[0:32:56] <%thomsato> trick for eye contact is just look between there eyes and its fine
[0:32:59] <+LeoStrahl> They were too busy looking at your package of course
[0:33:01] <echodrone81> force eye contact for intimidation. if they look away move right into their field of vision
[0:33:01] <$RubberFistFight> I got told once I didn't make enough eye contact. So I did it more. Then I got told I was making it too much. MAKE. YOUR FUCKING. MINDS. UP.
[0:33:03] <%thomsato> their*
[0:33:11] <RioGascar> @angriestpat my eyes are fucked up so I literally cant look people in the eyes. I think i am, but im not

[0:35:29] <Fujiwara_92> LUL

[0:35:32] <$RubberFistFight> Pat what I want to know is, with a wiener so girthy and gargantuan, how do you correct for the gravitational lensing its humongous mass causes?
[0:35:32] <%mandragoraroot> :)
[0:35:32] <+rogoho> The littlest pat
[0:35:32] <echodrone81> so basically Pat's weapon in the game is just his dick
[0:35:32] <+SlagChambers> The salt is real Pat
[0:35:35] <Animeshowfan> to see such a perfect penis would ruin all other pens for the reast of us
[0:35:35] <jack_s1n> I don't show mine cuz it's weird

[0:35:47] <@JustinianKnight> yea being tall is pretty alright
[0:35:47] <%happyface699> Not bittwr
[0:35:48] <bswaldmann> short people are bitter and angry because they're physically closer to hell
[0:35:48] <Goldenwolf98> I was hoping for that reaction LUL
[0:35:49] <Haarute> sbfpSetIn
[0:35:53] <gazdropish> what are the advantags of being REALLY tall
[0:35:54] <%AlasterAngelo> Pat I'm going to sleep now and if you're not still streaming when I wake up I'm going to kick your shins

[0:35:57] <+rogoho> Bitter as coffee
[0:35:58] <+Buytoast> have you considered rebuilding your house to be smaller?
[0:36:01] <swansong118> Then how did they get up there?
[0:36:01] <RioGascar> @angriestpat my eyes are fucked up so I literally cant look people in the eyes. I think i am, but im not
[0:36:01] <%Chichen> being 5 10" is pretty comfortable
[0:36:02] <grimenigma> I have trouble looking people in the eyes....cos it ends up hurting my neck
[0:36:04] <+joey_jrpg> @AngriestPat how come blood in ds3 looks so grey? it sucks super hard compared to bloodborne
[0:36:04] <%Chichen> no complaints
[0:36:07] <echodrone81> fun fact pat, shorter limbs means you can get swole super easy
[0:36:08] <gmmoshupisbae> I don't like bring tall because i stand out in a crowd
[0:36:10] <+driedputty> Wish I was short so that I could live as a hobbit.
[0:36:14] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I'm of average height and I can't reach some of my own shelves
[0:36:15] <Karwakamu> I have trouble making eye contact because people are not allowed to look me in the eye due to the royal etiquette
[0:36:17] <+Smiling_Robot> Damn son, you are up early.
[0:36:17] <+Shaggnar> Pat is closer to actual midget height than me height. That's something
[0:36:17] <+heroicspiritavenger> @angriestpat have you considered that your anxiety is simply an overactive imagination? You realize everyone comes to your stream due to loving your antics whether via SBFP or other mediums.
[0:36:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It's fiiine
[0:36:21] <+risenlp2> I wanna get DS3 but I have to wait for a sale ; _ ;
[0:36:23] <Haarute> ... Swole Pat would be the funniest thing.
[0:36:26] <RileyOMalley> Pat, as someone also around your height I feel you. But also, I'm the sort to climb like the little gremlin that I am
[0:36:28] <bear_breaker20> turning into a tree is one of my biggest fears
[0:36:30] <swansong118> Does paige put stuff on the high shelves?

[0:43:48] <+risenlp2> Are the players in ds3 not cursed undead? or some kind of different undead? using embers instead of humanity?
[0:43:50] <Domonomin> wtf*
[0:43:51] <+SWindleFeD> Chihuahua's are rats disguised as dogs DansGame
[0:43:54] <+driedputty> Will Elmo's friend be called Emlo?
[0:43:56] <%mandragoraroot> :)
[0:43:56] <Fujiwara_92> that's not funny, it's just mildly interesting
[0:43:57] <%Chichen> pat fits in paiges purse
[0:44:00] <Domonomin> it's 7 in the morning
[0:44:06] <%SmolBluGhost> doggo

[0:44:14] <+AlwaysBeGaming> dog napper
[0:44:14] <echodrone81> pat is Paige's purse
[0:44:15] <%disgracefulking> sbfpMember FrankerZ
[0:44:20] <%envy1499> Get a dog and name him dog
[0:44:22] <swansong118> Well yeah we said that?
[0:44:23] <AmericanaRed> TAKEN
[0:44:24] <Run44forrest> pat should do a french stream like joel did that swede stream
[0:44:28] <urkleturtle> it's lunch time for me. finally a stream for us eurotrash
[0:44:29] <rhus> that's cute. i was honestly expecting that story to take a big turn for the worse.
[0:44:29] <mercado94> like lost keys
[0:44:30] <grayjammer> @risenlp2 Pretty much i think? Basically Undead but too shitty to rekindle the first flame on their own
[0:44:32] <SilverBrass> Paige's purse is too full of McDonalds wrappers
[0:44:32] <Cjthebagman> What's in Paige's purse?
[0:44:34] <+driedputty> Too much lupus in her purse for pat to fit
[0:44:36] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat have you played dmc3 with the style switcher mod yet? It feels so weird since im so useto only running on style, but being able to swap between RG and SM on the fly feels really good
[0:44:38] <Shooterboy23> Have a son and name him Boy
[0:44:38] <%mandragoraroot> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:44:41] <+silvereco19> then you can actually fuck the dog
[0:44:41] <%SmolBluGhost> He is doing his best
[0:44:42] <+AlwaysBeGaming> name him meat
[0:44:44] <SoaringLettuce> i just realized something: todd cowards stand "sweet little lies" works a lot like crazt talk, making his statements active lies rather than being wrong
[0:44:46] <Haarute> Get a dog and name him "Cat"
[0:44:49] <%Chichen> pat uses his pokemon naming conventions for pets
[0:44:50] <Fujiwara_92> you know what's funny, ppl who say you know what's funny, cause most of the times it isn't funny
[0:44:52] <+AlwaysBeGaming> or dinner
[0:44:55] <%Chichen> "Cat" "Dog"
[0:44:58] <%LtDogg07> wow dude why so early
[0:45:00] <%mandragoraroot> @shooterboy23 theres a guy in my stepdads family named boy
[0:45:04] <echodrone81> mortal engines movie looks like a dumpster fire
[0:45:07] <T_sarr> no no relaxation

[0:45:38] <bswaldmann> get fucked tree
[0:45:38] <+heroicspiritavenger> @echodrone81 it might be okay for VSFX but the acting and plot looks awful
[0:45:42] <+driedputty> @echodrone81 A dumpsterfire would be a complement. That movie just looks bad.
[0:45:47] <swansong118> Now we fuck the trees!
[0:45:47] <Haarute> Because people are just waking up.
[0:45:51] <%mandragoraroot> pat what are you doing

[0:46:55] <Run44forrest> breakfast redbull mmm
[0:46:57] <sperium3000> Follow your rainbow, Pat!
[0:47:06] <grayjammer> Milhouse Knights
[0:47:07] <$RubberFistFight> @PlagueOfGripes this entire DLC is fucking garbage. There's a place filled with maggot-covered flies later on that makes this area look like a picnic
[0:47:15] <$RubberFistFight> Ringed City is much better
[0:47:17] <endlessdream9> damn this game sure is dark, but it also has soul
[0:47:21] <seycheles> fuckin pat better still be going to the gym
[0:47:21] <Fujiwara_92> 7am red bull DansGame
[0:47:21] <+Thorn14> Pat this is Witching Hour, be careful.
[0:47:28] <+heroicspiritavenger> @shooterboy23 his little legs can't carry him that far in the harsh Canadian winter
[0:47:37] <+AlwaysBeGaming> is this fallout
[0:47:40] <Jarvanii> just run to the boss brah
[0:47:40] <+driedputty> It's not a morning Rebull if he never slept.
[0:47:41] <mercado94> stop drinking red bull
[0:47:50] <ChetThunderscum> pfft, too hard. I rushed it for Friede's Scythe in one of my dex builds
[0:48:04] <Run44forrest> no he just woke up like 2 hours ago
[0:48:07] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah you get to the cathedral and Gael's like "hay look at my painting scrap" and you're like "Ok WAIT WHAT THE FUCK"
[0:48:07] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it's perfect for ng+
[0:48:08] <ConLin_Plays> oh hey, its the GOTY winner God of War!
[0:48:18] <%envy1499> Playing darksouls first thing in the morning sounds worse than taking a cold shower
[0:48:21] <+JustToWatch> it's 7 am where pat is, it's straight up morning
[0:48:21] <+silvereco19> pat is WOKE
[0:48:23] <T_sarr> GoW winning is a travesty
[0:48:25] <illustriouslangley> He's gonna end up with kidney stones and cry harder when he had to go the the ER for big poops
[0:48:25] <+Karebuncle> pats hekkin woke
[0:48:26] <SaikaMercenary> so this is ashes of ariandel, right?
[0:48:28] <+AlwaysBeGaming> DansGame
[0:48:30] <+NinjaWitaSniper> too hard? obky trouble I had with this dlc was Friede and thats because shes bullshit lmao
[0:48:31] <+JustToWatch> NANI
[0:48:34] <%Chichen> @SaikaMercenary yes
[0:48:35] <+Thorn14> Best Part of Waking Up is RedBull in your cup
[0:48:36] <+Kavtech> Patrick has AWOKEN.
[0:48:37] <mercado94> oh boy
[0:48:39] <Fujiwara_92> if u slept why are you drinking then?
[0:48:43] <SaikaMercenary> @Chichen thank you
[0:48:43] <Goldenwolf98> The weapons are the only good things to come out of this DLC really
[0:48:44] <%SmolBluGhost> Then again i never get to see Pat stream nowadays so ill take it
[0:48:44] <SoaringLettuce> a full night of sleep is the best redbull of all
[0:48:50] <MegboyManuel> Red Dead Redemption sweeping was DISGUSTING
[0:48:51] <chancho4tierra> good morning from Chile, i stayed up all night and was getting to bed and wosh a livestream
[0:48:51] <TehLankyGuy> Morning pat
[0:48:53] <%disgracefulking> DansGame DansGame DansGame
[0:48:54] <%crowsloft77> i tried that but i always wake up at midnight
[0:48:57] <%Dragonfang1337> no stop drinking in geberal
[0:48:57] <Tubit> no, fuck fortnite tho
[0:48:58] <Amberizing> fortnite didnt come out this year tho
[0:48:58] <+Belakitu> Good morning Pat and chat, could I get some good energy, I have my last final for the semester today and would appreciate it
[0:48:59] <+Shaggnar> They're doing something right to get all that money
[0:48:59] <swansong118> Maybe the real redbull was inside us all along
[0:49:01] <%PipIV> how long had this been going? I just woke up and going to work
[0:49:02] <%axellogic> Thats my standard
[0:49:02] <Jontman42> Fortnite becomes cancer the better you're at it though.
[0:49:04] <%Chichen> Wow pat what the fuck having rational opinions
[0:49:06] <wookie5358> Did Fortnite come out this year?
[0:49:06] <$RubberFistFight> @illustriouslangley kidney stones are actually largely genetic - its mostly down to how your body eliminates mineral waste like struvite and oxalates
[0:49:08] <Chatterbox1991> Pat is weirdly reasonable in the morning
[0:49:09] <%axellogic> Red Dead doesnt get to hog all the awards
[0:49:13] <brambobelurkin> people not liking Friedes fight
[0:49:14] <+zounin> shut up Pat, youre wrong1
[0:49:16] <ConLin_Plays> GoW just needed more amazing bosses and not the same Trolls all the time
[0:49:17] <Jarvanii> fortnite is the domestic abuse game of the year
[0:49:18] <Mnightshyamallama> I know I am in the minority but I just don't think the new GoW was that great.
[0:49:21] <Fujiwara_92> the morning red bull was the friends we made along the way
[0:49:23] <jack_s1n> i wish Spider-Man got something
[0:49:23] <+enickma11> @Belakitu Good luck on your final man, mine are next week so give me some energy in return then
[0:49:25] <mrkerb> Could DS have a battle royle mode
[0:49:27] <+AlwaysBeGaming> crazy talk
[0:49:27] <Run44forrest> morning coffee? nope redbull
[0:49:28] <T_sarr> I see where you're coming from but you've yet to beat RDR iirc
[0:49:28] <%envy1499> Pubg sues fortnights for stealing goty
[0:49:30] <%Smokay17> I would have liked it if Spider Man got a couple things
[0:49:33] <%disgracefulking> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatWrong apatMenace
[0:49:34] <%axellogic> And I actually cared about God of War so I was pleased with the result
[0:49:38] <+risenlp2> @AngriestPat did you see Mesa's new prime hat?
[0:49:38] <urkleturtle> weirdly enough i started replaying divinity os 2 just a few days before you started considering going back to it. must be all that excessive warframez grinding making us hungry for some relaxed turn-based roleplaying
[0:49:41] <+driedputty> At least RDR2 lost game of the year and... art direction I think?
[0:49:42] <+NinjaWitaSniper> I honestly think the new GoW was trying too hard to be The Last of Us
[0:49:46] <+heroicspiritavenger> @angriestpat wouldn't Forknife winning be like Warframe winning, and technically unfair due to them existing for years in some capacity or another
[0:49:48] <swansong118> Well technically trees are alive so
[0:49:48] <Fujiwara_92> I'm still shocked idea man got nothing
[0:49:52] <%Chichen> spider-man getting nothing is probably the saddest part
[0:49:55] <+AlwaysBeGaming> Dayz game of year 2019
[0:49:57] <+Belakitu> @enickma11 GivePLZ TwitchUnity
[0:49:58] <+Thorn14> MHW getting the pity RPG award despite not being a RPG
[0:50:03] <Fujiwara_92> *spider man
[0:50:06] <wookie5358> You could say they dug themselves into a (blue)hole
[0:50:07] <endlessdream9> that dog is bigger than my dog
[0:50:08] <rhus> no but they need more money tho
[0:50:12] <Esperflame> OMG it's Pat playing Dark Souls 3! :D
[0:50:13] <ConLin_Plays> I'm sad that they just skipped the "Games for Impact" nominees, poor Swery's the Missing didn't get mentioned at all BibleThump
[0:50:15] <sperium3000> And now Blackout exists so PUBG is osbolete
[0:50:16] <MegboyManuel> never played pubg cause of that shit, disgusting
[0:50:20] <SoaringLettuce> yeah but they didnt make ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
[0:50:24] <mercado94> not as embarassing as Fallout76
[0:50:26] <$RubberFistFight> yeah Bluehole are acting like a bunch of cunt losers and I wish I hadn't bought their fucking trash-heap of a game.
[0:50:27] <SaikaMercenary> Can PUBG and Fortnite just...you know...fuck off? Tired of seeing them
[0:50:28] <Jarvanii> I thought that too pat
[0:50:28] <%cirdrag> good morning guys!
[0:50:29] <kazadog> PUBG had so many opportunities to properly compete with fortnite and fucked it up every time
[0:50:29] <+megamonmon123> even if there was a category caller saddest death red dead would have won over spiderman
[0:50:31] <TheBigO75> no one knows wtf a rpg is anymore
[0:50:31] <+sicLoki> !uptime
[0:50:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 50m 33s.
[0:50:31] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat dont forget the guy who made PUBG said the reason why they wont get region locked servers was because "its racist and xenophobic"
[0:50:32] <+QuadraticGravity> monster hunter should have won best score imo
[0:50:32] <+driedputty> But isn't every game an RPG? In every game you're playing the roll of a character.
[0:50:34] <sperium3000> Monster Hunter deserved to win something... NOT RPG
[0:50:34] <Goldenwolf98> Dark Souls is more of an RPG than fuckin Monster Hunter LUL
[0:50:36] <%Dragonfang1337> MHW getting RPG for pity and accidently shafting all the actual RPGs in the process
[0:50:37] <MegboyManuel> it's a travesty they gave out those awards in the PRESHOW
[0:50:38] <%mandragoraroot> apatBig
[0:50:40] <T_sarr> thats how i felt about GoW
[0:50:40] <%BioApple> gotta get those frying pan copyright bucks before valve notices
[0:50:42] <+Kongro_> The RPG genre was pretty lacking this year.
[0:50:42] <Shooterboy23> Best action game of the year
[0:50:43] <Jontman42> What the fuck does RPG even mean anymore
[0:50:44] <Fujiwara_92> and yet nothing for spider man
[0:50:48] <+Kavtech> Monster Hunter's a great game, but it's not an RPG.
[0:50:48] <Tubit> RPG=anything with swords in it
[0:50:49] <Caidezes> God of War is the best RPG.
[0:50:50] <Inebriateddonut> No one fucking knows what an RPG is, fuck call of duty is an RPG now
[0:50:52] <%LtDogg07> who do you think should have won @angriestpat
[0:50:53] <Run44forrest> how long is swerys missing vJJ
[0:50:56] <+AlwaysBeGaming> rating pending on revisions
[0:50:59] <$RubberFistFight> aren't basically all games fuckin RPGs anyway? Coz you're playing a role that isn't your real life role?
[0:51:01] <Mnightshyamallama> it is only the best selling capcom game ever no big deal. it isn't like capcom has a crazy amount of historically significant games or anything
[0:51:01] <+heroicspiritavenger> @angriestpat couldn't you literally say that about Sony, whose head is getting big to them again this generation though
[0:51:04] <sperium3000> Fortnite is my favorite visual novel
[0:51:05] <%mandragoraroot> ?
[0:51:05] <MegboyManuel> Why were there so many tv folks in a gaming award show????
[0:51:05] <Chatterbox1991> speaking of RPGs i am happy that Dragon Age is going to continue to not die
[0:51:06] <bear_breaker20> How the fuck do pepole "role play" souls games?
[0:51:07] <mercado94> if theres a lot of numbers its a RPG at this point
[0:51:08] <%envy1499> Fought behemoth again earlier and it still makes me want to break my controller
[0:51:11] <$RubberFistFight> like how far do you want to stretch it?
[0:51:11] <ConLin_Plays> GoW is somewhat of an RPG
[0:51:12] <urkleturtle> call of duty winning rpg of the year next year, because it's got leveling up
[0:51:17] <fireking900> Pillars 2 or dragon quest should have won rpg
[0:51:17] <RetributionP> if you can create a person it's solid a rpg
[0:51:21] <+rogoho> Owned
[0:51:24] <SoaringLettuce> max and the guys said it had the best action MECHANICS so it should have won best action game
[0:51:25] <%mandragoraroot> SoS
[0:51:31] <sperium3000> My favorite survivor horror game? Detective Pikachu
[0:51:32] <ConLin_Plays> haha
[0:51:32] <durant_kdtrey> Yeah I had no idea how Monster hunter beat out Fallout 76 Kappa
[0:51:34] <$RubberFistFight> also, "How Far do you want to Stretch It?" - title of Pat's new sex tape.
[0:51:37] <%Dragonfang1337> jrpgs arpgs wrpgs crpgs
[0:51:37] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat Are you going to try Ashen, it's pretty good
[0:51:37] <+0ldenboy> PRAISE THE SUN
[0:51:38] <Fujiwara_92> you can play a role in DS games...
[0:51:42] <%Chichen> praise it with your double dab pat
[0:51:42] <+Kongro_> But yeah, RPG is more of a sub-genre nwo. Action RPGs, Strategy RPGs, Turn-based RPGs, etc.
[0:51:42] <wookie5358> There are a ton of genres that are washed out nowadays. Just look at the tagging system on Steam.
[0:51:44] <Jontman42> I mean GoW, Spider-Man and RDR2 are all RPGs
[0:51:44] <+MooseyFate100> Here comes the sun doot n doo doo
[0:51:45] <T_sarr> I despise that moment
[0:51:45] <+AlwaysBeGaming> DansGame
[0:51:46] <+driedputty> Damn.
[0:51:48] <+Thorn14> Praise it
[0:51:49] <Goldenwolf98> Like MHW would count more as a character action game than rpg honestly LUL
[0:51:49] <LeaIsChill> Tomorrow FeelsBadMan
[0:51:51] <gazdropish> but pat, turn based combat is outdated and NEVER sells
[0:51:52] <Fujiwara_92> \[T]/
[0:51:54] <mercado94> happy virgin maria day
[0:51:55] <SeventyForce> Pat, pat you look pale. Deathly friggin pale.
[0:51:56] <+SlagChambers> But...Tomorrow is Today!?
[0:51:59] <ChetThunderscum> i'd say Monster Hunter has enough numbers and RPG mechanics to count as an "RPG"
[0:52:00] <illustriouslangley> Pat already had the gout, that is a pretty good indicator he is susceptible for kidney stones.
[0:52:00] <%mandragoraroot> jermaPluto
[0:52:00] <+risenlp2> Why is MH:W not an RPG? because all your progress is in items and weapons and not stats?
[0:52:01] <+megamonmon123> hey guys, today is new comicbook day
[0:52:03] <%Chichen> double dab
[0:52:05] <ConLin_Plays> don't get burned out!
[0:52:05] <%SmolBluGhost> Can't wait for dragon age 4 at this point tho
[0:52:06] <Jarvanii> I mean even rdr2 is kinda more of a RPG than mhw
[0:52:06] <Them00n> Honestly the only pure RPG games are tabletop RPGs.
[0:52:09] <+Belakitu> And then strem more later right?
[0:52:09] <Animeshowfan> whats happening at work
[0:52:10] <bswaldmann> pre-work stream is the way to do it
[0:52:10] <brambobelurkin> you goofy goober you
[0:52:11] <jack_s1n> how did it take that long for your sun to get up?
[0:52:12] <grayjammer> Why are you climbing the tower again
[0:52:14] <+AlwaysBeGaming> same

[0:52:40] <+driedputty> Go to bed.
[0:52:40] <%mandragoraroot> no
[0:52:40] <ChillTonic> We prefer the term "Unblemished by light"
[0:52:40] <+Kavtech> I am.
[0:52:42] <Fujiwara_92> oof
[0:52:44] <+Thorn14> Imagine Tanned Pat
[0:52:44] <+heroicspiritavenger> @megamonmon123 people are still reading comics after the industry has been overrun with politics that keep it from just being escapism?
[0:52:45] <grayjammer> Freakign Epic
[0:52:45] <+Ryuartyi_> Waking up to a stream announcement is wild, you mad lad.
[0:52:46] <%Chichen> whens your rap career :)
[0:52:47] <mercado94> no
[0:52:48] <gazdropish> @risenlp2 i mean, any game is an rpg then
[0:52:49] <%Tearonex> Well, Max just beat 9.9 Smash
[0:52:50] <+AlwaysBeGaming> go back to bed
[0:52:51] <Chatterbox1991> hopefully Deread Wolf will be good
[0:52:51] <SeventyForce> Have you eating anything doe? Maybe get something for breakfast?
[0:52:51] <TehLankyGuy> @angriestpat you should get a fake tan for the memes
[0:52:57] <ConLin_Plays> Is Star Trek as broken as Ride to Hell?
[0:53:02] <Animeshowfan> not even sure that rhymed
[0:53:03] <$RubberFistFight> @Kongro_ if it wasn't for all the pale gingers, the Earth's albedo would be lower and global warming would be so much worse.
[0:53:04] <illustriouslangley> orange skin to match the hair
[0:53:12] <StickyBobBill55> I understand the random sleep tho I just started working third shift and I slept for 20 hrs straight yesterday
[0:53:13] <+megamonmon123> @heroicspiritavenger yes because good comics are still being made and if anyone says otherwise they arent paying attention
[0:53:15] <+liquidzr0> i did that with K Rool
[0:53:16] <ConLin_Plays> good!
[0:53:17] <+Kavtech> A bit less.
[0:53:17] <Goldenwolf98> It cant be more broken than that
[0:53:19] <+AlwaysBeGaming> when is fallout?
[0:53:23] <Mnightshyamallama> wtf
[0:53:25] <bokuwahmz> if you run up against the short cliff next to the milwood greatbow, you can glitch jump up there instead of going through the area
[0:53:26] <xanerts> Same wiith K Rool
[0:53:31] <Fynale> idk star trek atleast animates well
[0:53:37] <+liquidzr0> @xanerts
[0:53:39] <wookie5358> Star Trek is broken in a way that brings amusement. Ride to Hell is broken in a way that brings soul crushing anguish
[0:53:40] <+Belakitu> doodBenny
[0:53:43] <Jontman42> Big puppo
[0:53:43] <$Sdeje> But it led to Warframe and that's what matters
[0:53:47] <%LtDogg07> ef that item
[0:53:47] <+risenlp2> Oh hai, Not-Sif
[0:53:47] <Animeshowfan> what made you want to lp star trek in the first place
[0:53:48] <+liquidzr0> d1xHey

[0:53:55] <+Kirbachev> @wookie5358 That does that make Omikron, then?
[0:53:56] <+driedputty> It's time to pound poochie
[0:53:58] <%envy1499> Most broken game I ever played was shadow of Mordor on ps3
[0:54:00] <+Thorn14> K Rool gonna get that nerf bat
[0:54:00] <%mandragoraroot> Wowee
[0:54:02] <+Solutha> but it made you invent warframe

[0:54:16] <fireking900> rip

[0:54:34] <+Thorn14> THE TABLES HAVE TURNED HUUMAN
[0:54:34] <+rogoho> Hubris!
[0:54:38] <%Chichen> the dog fucked you
[0:54:39] <bear_breaker20> haha guess you could say who lert the dogs IN? wakka wakka
[0:54:39] <wookie5358> Omikron is the game that split the best friends in half. I know it's coincidence, but it lines up so well that's how I view it.
[0:54:41] <%LtDogg07> the tables have in fact turned
[0:54:42] <%Chichen> this time
[0:54:42] <+Kirbachev> A canine of significant size appears to have consumed your hind-quarters with considerable vigour.
[0:54:44] <%mandragoraroot> no :)
[0:54:46] <+sicLoki> @AngriestPat show your t-shirt please :D
[0:54:46] <Esperflame> Fun fact: Squirrel Girl beat Thanos
[0:54:47] <%Dragonfang1337> crikBone
[0:54:53] <fireking900> @endlessdream9 what fight they both suck
[0:54:53] <studleydoorite> this time the POOCH screwed YOU
[0:54:54] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat why not just run past them?
[0:54:57] <$RubberFistFight> jesus I got up to piss and came back and Pat is screwing canines again
[0:55:02] <+megamonmon123> squirrel girl beat galactus
[0:55:02] <+heroicspiritavenger> THE TABLES HAVE TURNED HOOMIN
[0:55:06] <+driedputty> Why are we watching this shit when we could be looking at Elmo?
[0:55:08] <+megamonmon123> amd doctor doom
[0:55:10] <Who_lio42> the toxo is talkin again
[0:55:15] <Esperflame> She is a legend
[0:55:16] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat How do you feel about the idea of DE making a spin off single player game set in Warframes universe and based more on the original Dark Sector story?
[0:55:19] <Run44forrest> time for sleeo giood bye chat
[0:55:22] <ConLin_Plays> Squirrel Girl beat Galactus by befriending him!
[0:55:25] <$RubberFistFight> @megamonmon123 who gives a shit what that fucking joke character does
[0:55:27] <bokuwahmz> you can jump up that cliff on the left where you ran past the dogs
[0:55:35] <%SolitudeOtM> and to be clear, they aren't doing that, but what if they did
[0:55:49] <endlessdream9> serious question, who let the dogs out?
[0:55:53] <teflonbilly777> That is a large doggo
[0:55:53] <+megamonmon123> @rubberfistfight so no one should care about saitama, got it
[0:55:53] <Esperflame> @RubberFistFight Hold your tongue or people might say the same about Deadpool.
[0:56:01] <+Bouerd> These guys are surprisingly weak to frost
[0:56:06] <+Thorn14> Every time Elmo is not on screen everyone should be asking "Wheres Elmo?"
[0:56:09] <$Ralfclogs> CorgiDerp
[0:56:09] <+JustToWatch> that was obviously just a hologram projected from a low orbit satellite
[0:56:11] <ConLin_Plays> Squirrel Girl is great!
[0:56:13] <%SmolBluGhost> I remember buying and playing DmC just for the shits, not knowing the amazing travesty that is this game, trilby and all
[0:56:16] <teflonbilly777> Stupid tree
[0:56:18] <%envy1499> Figuring out how to sub through the twitch app has to be one of the most convoluted things I’ve done
[0:56:20] <$Ralfclogs> OhMyDog
[0:56:20] <bokuwahmz> well they're not native inhabitants
[0:56:23] <$RubberFistFight> @Esperflame yeah, except Deadpool wasn't created as a gimmick
[0:56:26] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> AMAZING, I CAUGHT A DS3 STREAM
[0:56:26] <teflonbilly777> I never played the DLCs for Dark Souls 3
[0:56:27] <T_sarr> the last thing you'd want in snow is even more snow
[0:56:28] <ShershaAD> Damn pat youve really been playing this a lot lately, must really scratch that one specific itch
[0:56:34] <%drabberfaun535> !uptime
[0:56:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 56m 36s.
[0:56:35] <%LtDogg07> its weird not hearing Elmo's death wails
[0:56:35] <Run44forrest> did pat get the item all the way to the right in the forrest and back up
[0:56:40] <Tubit> squirrel girl does everything in between panels
[0:56:46] <+megamonmon123> fun fact: gwenpool has no relation to gwen stacy or deadpool in anyway whatsoever
[0:57:04] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> btw can someone explain the "pat stares" meme?
[0:57:08] <ConLin_Plays> but she started out in the Spider-Gwen is everyone thing
[0:57:13] <$RubberFistFight> @megamonmon123 but don't let that stop them from implying that she does in order to sell the title
[0:57:15] <T_sarr> he cant blink
[0:57:25] <Inebriateddonut> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries you mean the picture of his face?
[0:57:26] <teflonbilly777> I heard Kid Omega banged Gwenpool, but didn't know she wasn't a mutie so now his mutant supremacy world is shattered
[0:57:32] <+zounin> Pat, have ye played with Garuda yet?
[0:57:33] <+heroicspiritavenger> @megamonmon123 she's also Heather Antos's self insert
[0:57:33] <RantingRavager> fun fact: gwenpool is CUTE
[0:57:39] <+Thorn14> Squirrel Girl was great in Marvel Heroes (rip) she made it RAIN squirrels. Like a fucking FLOOD
[0:57:40] <$Ralfclogs> OhMyDog
[0:57:42] <%Dragonfang1337> @eattheb0otylikegroceries pat stares at was the name of an old video
[0:57:42] <Esperflame> Big doggo....big doggo chase.....
[0:57:43] <+megamonmon123> @rubberfistfight i dont get why you hate the character so mich but okay
[0:57:44] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @Inebriateddonut nah the idea of him just staring
[0:57:52] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ah gotcha
[0:58:01] <ConLin_Plays> I got the Gwenpool mafex figurine, still need to read the comics!
[0:58:02] <Haarute> Wa that wolf really big or is Pat's character just Pat sized.
[0:58:03] <$RubberFistFight> @megamonmon123 because self-insert mary sues never bring anything of quality to any stories
[0:58:08] <+megamonmon123> @heroicspiritavenger eh i dont no so much about that. she is a cool character regardless
[0:58:10] <teflonbilly777> I need to catch up on Gwenpool. I've honsetly tapped out of Marvel since Secret Empire ended and been mostly reading DC comics if not indies
[0:58:14] <Cobalt_Plated14> @eattheb0otylikegroceries I appreciate your name.
[0:58:21] <teflonbilly777> Mister Miracle is the best book of 2018
[0:58:22] <$FriedMattato> Pat, it's before noon, why are you awake?
[0:58:25] <+megamonmon123> @rubberfistfight who is she even a self insert og
[0:58:25] <$Ralfclogs> OhMyDog
[0:58:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's soooooo hard
[0:58:26] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> i appreciate the booty Kappa
[0:58:27] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Oh shit, good morning Pat!
[0:58:32] <%SmolBluGhost> i bet
[0:58:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> you'll die soooo much!
[0:58:33] <T_sarr> YOU THOUGHT
[0:58:35] <Inebriateddonut> What was the first Pat stares at video? Was it the Broforce one?
[0:58:38] <ConLin_Plays> I think Gwenpool is over, but she's part of the Venom thing going on I think
[0:58:38] <$RubberFistFight> @teflonbilly777 marvel comics are a dumpster fire at the moment, don't waste your time.
[0:58:40] <+megamonmon123> didnt a guy make squirrel girl?.
[0:58:40] <Esperflame> I'm really happy they're doing a Skrull arch.
[0:58:45] <urkleturtle> man, these ragdolls are just the best. literally clobbered the bones out of these doggos
[0:58:47] <+heroicspiritavenger> @megamonmon123 remember when Gwenpool's hair style was fairly unique and now Ghost Spider is literally just aesthetically the same
[0:58:49] <+rogoho> Alpha AF
[0:58:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Pat Stares at Mercenary Kings is the oldest one I remember.
[0:58:53] <+Thorn14> Up late or early, Plague?
[0:58:54] <Fujiwara_92> no item
[0:58:56] <%Dragonfang1337> pat stares at mercenary kings is the proto pat stares
[0:58:56] <%SolitudeOtM> you dont get shit
[0:59:08] <sileo_patronus> Hey I'm downloading EDF 5 right now. Does anyone know what playing with the partial download doesn't let you do?
[0:59:11] <bokuwahmz> well u get titanite shards for going early
[0:59:13] <%jiin6> 1 useless item for Pat
[0:59:14] <+megamonmon123> @heroicspiritavenger but gwenpool is still awesome, spider gwen is eh
[0:59:14] <Goldenwolf98> Theres your shit item for this shit area LUL
[0:59:17] <bokuwahmz> large*
[0:59:21] <%envy1499> Know what I mean?
[0:59:21] <teflonbilly777> @RubberFistFight That's the impression I got, though I enjoyed Secret Epire. Hydra Cap was a surprisingly engaging villain and the epilogue issue where real Cap has a talk with him was good
[0:59:28] <ConLin_Plays> Gwenom is frikkin amazing
[0:59:28] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat did you get the bow from that area?
[0:59:29] <+megamonmon123> also yes gwenpool and quinten made out
[0:59:32] <T_sarr> see what i mean?
[0:59:33] <+Belakitu> Trash for the trash god
[0:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:54] <Jontman42> Gwenom's design is so cool
[0:59:54] <$RubberFistFight> @teflonbilly777 if they could invent new characters instead of fucking around with existing ones, it wouldn't be so bad. But they can't, so you get what we've got now.
[0:59:58] <%envy1499> Ds2 lp was how I found sbfp. Best series
[1:00:00] <%Dragonfang1337> HYDRATE jermaChomp
[1:00:02] <bswaldmann> DRINK YOUR WATER!!!
[1:00:05] <Inebriateddonut> PAT DRINK
[1:00:09] <Fujiwara_92> spidergwen>gwenpool design wise at least
[1:00:10] <+Kongro_> everyone, drink some water
[1:00:15] <fireking900> Hydrated Bot PogChamp
[1:00:16] <T_sarr> chug chug
[1:00:19] <bswaldmann> drink water so you dont get yellow frothy deathpee
[1:00:20] <+Bouerd> Faraam armor looks great in snow areas
[1:00:21] <$sylphyyyy> Are you streaming at 7 in the morning lmfao why buddy
[1:00:23] <ConLin_Plays> oh yeah, Sekiro is in just a few months!
[1:00:28] <+luketrapwalker> Morning Pat! Please hydrate!
[1:00:31] <Sonicdy> Max Finally Done LUL
[1:00:31] <+Belakitu> EVERYONE GET MOINST
[1:00:31] <%jiin6> Sip sip for pat
[1:00:31] <$Ralfclogs> Pat Water Drink chugchug
[1:00:33] <+megamonmon123> ehh i dont like spidergwens design, the green slippers kills it a bit
[1:00:34] <+WaywardDoodles> This is some good morning content 🌞
[1:00:36] <Eresus> @envy1499 is the ds2 lp worth watching?
[1:00:39] <Kineziz> 6 am here wtf
[1:00:41] <bokuwahmz> time to drink some red bull
[1:00:44] <longrat> the betrayal in dark souls 3 is probably one of the coolest moments in the entire franchise
[1:00:44] <the_mental_punk> FAARAM SET
[1:00:45] <+Kongro_> i'm hydrating with some chocolate milk????
[1:00:45] <+megamonmon123> H Y D R A T E
[1:00:46] <Cobalt_Plated14> I’m so bored waiting for my Trinity Prime to finish. I can’t actually play any quests until she’s done because I’m an imbecile who can’t play video games until he has exactly what he wants as soon as possible, even if sequence breaking is needed.
[1:00:47] <%zeroarturia> pat why streaming this early?
[1:00:48] <teflonbilly777> DC has some great stuff though. I'm still salty about how Tom King wrote Batman #50, but everything after wards has been great except Nightwing getting shot in the dome. Heroes In Crisis and Doomsaday Clock are really engaging. And I think Super Sons is just adorable
[1:00:50] <bswaldmann> @luketrapwalker more like @looktapwater
[1:00:50] <longrat> i love it
[1:00:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Quick, cosplay a naked man!
[1:00:57] <$sylphyyyy> Right!! I thought the notification was wrong lmao. Maybe he can’t sleep.
[1:01:00] <%envy1499> @eresus yes definitely. Best memes
[1:01:01] <$Ralfclogs> sipsips
[1:01:03] <+megamonmon123> i think king on batman is a disaster
[1:01:03] <SaikaMercenary> Tarkus?
[1:01:03] <Fujiwara_92> HYDRATE OR DIEDRATE
[1:01:03] <%SmolBluGhost> Drink up gulp gulp apatPorgmo
[1:01:03] <Pistachius> cosplay santa, bet you can't
[1:01:04] <fireking900> haven't seen hydrated bot in a min i was scared twitch banned him
[1:01:04] <+luketrapwalker> @bswaldmann LUL
[1:01:08] <endlessdream9> sekero looks great, but i need that ghost of tsushima game in my life
[1:01:12] <gazdropish> @Eresus for the memes only
[1:01:14] <+megamonmon123> i also hate heroes in crisis
[1:01:21] <%envy1499> Drop your shield
[1:01:22] <+megamonmon123> immortal hulk is great
[1:01:22] <$RubberFistFight> @sylphyyyy he slept all night, he decided to stream when he got up because he actually got close to a full 8 hours for once.
[1:01:23] <%Dragonfang1337> @angriestpat buy a switch or save my money for the flood of non switch games i want next year
[1:01:24] <T_sarr> EAT IT
[1:01:27] <Richmond_> The millwood knight armour is the shit
[1:01:30] <ConLin_Plays> I got Trinity Prime through the Twitch Prime stuffs
[1:01:30] <+megamonmon123> i think matt would like immortal hulk
[1:01:31] <+Burger_Bonanza> @AngriestPat Hi Pat, I'm too stupid to sleep when I should, thank you for enabling my bullshit with this stream
[1:01:39] <teflonbilly777> All you Sekiro marks, should I play Nioh to scratch the itch before it comes out?
[1:01:44] <HentaiSenpai9K> @run44forrest Thank You ☺
[1:01:46] <Goldenwolf98> I have all of Trinity Primes part but have never bothered to make her for some reason I just dont care about her as a frame LUL
[1:01:47] <RamenRiderZ> Mesa Prime soon dude PogChamp FBCatch
[1:01:48] <+alphonseisbest> yes
[1:02:07] <Sanyle> so yesterday i had a really bad experience on a dark souls discord server talking about the monstrocities of sin, and they shat on me completely because they had a different interpretation
[1:02:07] <%8BitDsx> You should probably play NiOh before NiOh 2 comes out!
[1:02:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ahh yes, the DS3 farming spot... I know it well.
[1:02:16] <urkleturtle> same
[1:02:16] <Goldenwolf98> I do that all the time Pat
[1:02:17] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I was prepared to hate it, cause most modern Crisis comics suck, but outside of Harley Quinn's plot armor, I'm intrigued by teh premise
[1:02:22] <T_sarr> it's really long, might make you dislike the setting
[1:02:23] <Inebriateddonut> Sometimes the primes are easier to get than the normals
[1:02:25] <TheBigO75> Seems cool to me
[1:02:36] <urkleturtle> just built regular for the mr fodder
[1:02:37] <$RubberFistFight> Pat you're letting him hit you
[1:02:42] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> remember to check all the buttons when you 2hand a new weapon, pat. you missed some good attacks with the quilt and rapier weapon in the lp
[1:02:42] <+dirtyh4rr1> and now Mesa prime is gonna be easier to get than normal mesa
[1:02:42] <+morow1ec> Calamity ring or no balls
[1:02:43] <$RubberFistFight> stop that
[1:02:44] <Cobalt_Plated14> @goldenwolf98 I think in a game like Warframe, healers are a weird pick, even though it’s co-op. But I’m a ravenous support main, so I’m weird.
[1:02:44] <%SmolBluGhost> he did his best
[1:02:44] <+Belakitu> OH Tips for someone who just downloaded Warframe on their Switch, what best thing to do first? Play all story?
[1:02:46] <+Ondartyr> Mesa prime will be much easier to get than base mesa, too
[1:02:48] <HentaiSenpai9K> My favourite farming spot is cheat engines
[1:02:55] <+Deft_Thought> Chroma Prime, in particular, is a lot easier to get than Chroma
[1:02:57] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 alot of it makes no sense and king writes alot of characters out of charater and how sanctuary works seems kind of stupid
[1:03:00] <Inebriateddonut> @Belakitu Focus on starchart
[1:03:02] <+alphonseisbest> @sanyleswhat happpun?
[1:03:07] <+megamonmon123> i mean wally just swims in delusion it seems
[1:03:19] <+morow1ec> Mesa Prime looks soooo goooood
[1:03:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I can't believe SSaryn is in Warframe
[1:03:22] <Goldenwolf98> Its because sometimes the Primed Frames are easier to get then the regular versions thats why
[1:03:25] <longrat> PAYPIG
[1:03:29] <+megamonmon123> king's booster gold is the worst
[1:03:29] <+Solutha> tfw got mesa b4 the made it ez and now the prime is coming LUL
[1:03:36] <fazoburquina> Getting Mesa Prime is gonna be a lot easier to get than normal Mesa
[1:03:38] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I'm taking it as Sanctuary being a fundementally bad idea
[1:03:38] <ConLin_Plays> I'm close to getting regular chroma, just need the Volt and Saryn things
[1:03:38] <+Deft_Thought> I just got Harrow and he's fun.
[1:03:43] <+QuadraticGravity> OH YAY I WASNT ALONE ON THE SARYN SYSTEMS
[1:03:43] <TheBigO75> @Belakitu Build shit. Never stop building shit. Max out shit, sell it, and make more shit
[1:03:44] <Inebriateddonut> @Belakitu Although try to do story rather quickly because spoilers and all that
[1:03:47] <Fujiwara_92> m O N e Y
[1:03:59] <SaikaMercenary> so glad i got chroma before sedna rework
[1:04:00] <ConLin_Plays> I recently built Ember
[1:04:06] <grayjammer> KELA DE THAYM NEVER
[1:04:06] <T_sarr> muneh
[1:04:08] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 heroes getting help is a bad idea? oof that would be a bad message to push
[1:04:14] <MonstersDogma> Why the fuck are you up so early pat?
[1:04:15] <MadOx__> Almost at 200 days login bonus to finally get my Zenistar. Had a rivin sitting on it for months.
[1:04:17] <Cobalt_Plated14> I did a decent amount of relic farming to get Trinity Prime for platinum. I haven’t even done the New Strange quest yet.
[1:04:22] <+Deft_Thought> I lucked out and managed to get most of Harrow without a lengthy farm, except on the parts you need to get from Spy missions
[1:04:31] <enoughmold> Hi everybody
[1:04:32] <Sanyle> @alphonseisbest basically i brought forth evidence that was contrary to their opinion so they memed me and basically called me a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist
[1:04:32] <ConLin_Plays> I'm so comfy using my Valkyr Prime and Octavia ;v;
[1:04:34] <T_sarr> where's his swag sword?
[1:04:36] <$RubberFistFight> christ this guy has a great voice
[1:04:36] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> TAKE HIS PONCHO
[1:04:48] <Inebriateddonut> Kreygasm voice Kreygasm
[1:04:52] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It sounds like it hurts to talk
[1:04:55] <endlessdream9> unkindled? someone stole his kindle?
[1:04:55] <+Belakitu> Thanks guys, appreciate the tips SeemsGood
[1:04:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> this guy is an asshole
[1:04:56] <+DZiffer> His armor is the feaking best
[1:04:56] <medril07> HE IS A BADASS
[1:04:56] <god__of__lore> Pat what the fuck your stream notification literally woke me up, why are you up so early
[1:04:57] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> But man does it sound fucking great
[1:05:00] <+Solutha> chicken legged fuck
[1:05:01] <+megamonmon123> is a swag sword a sward or a sworg
[1:05:01] <wolfen091> is it 6pm and im just not awake?
[1:05:03] <+DZiffer> my favorite armor in the game
[1:05:05] <$RubberFistFight> @PlagueOfGripes oh yeah he's a massive shit
[1:05:10] <+KawaiiJetty> Hey look a wasted potential badass lol
[1:05:15] <$RubberFistFight> sounds great though
[1:05:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> why is he wearing a helmet with a coat? what a dumbass
[1:05:18] <+alphonseisbest> @sanyle. eh, that ducks but don't sound too bad
[1:05:21] <brambobelurkin> the gloves are light the rest is heavy
[1:05:27] <Goldenwolf98> I just recently got Chroma Prime and gave it a color scheme loosely based off of Shinji's Eva, hes a good dragon boi
[1:05:30] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yo, I don't know shit about Warframe, but I just turned on the client, and Garuda looks sick!
[1:05:30] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Because it looks good Eli, it's fine
[1:05:33] <%Dragonfang1337> jermaPluto twitch app delays thr stream by so much
[1:05:34] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Just don't think about it
[1:05:36] <+DZiffer> it's heavy armor though
[1:05:38] <ConLin_Plays> Sister Friede or Lady Maria????
[1:05:38] <+Kirbachev> His sword is fucking great, if a bit edgelordy.
[1:05:40] <+whiskywolfe> Because he doesn’t want his armour to get dirrrrty
[1:05:41] <endlessdream9> shes so.........heavyyyyyyyyy
[1:05:45] <+megamonmon123> @plagueofgripes he wants to be warmer and look cooler at teh same time
[1:05:46] <Cobalt_Plated14> @plagueofgripes Because dumbass outfits are cool.
[1:05:47] <@Volta_Bass> Are people doing fashion souls in universe?
[1:05:48] <+mastertwin2> The coat is chainmail though, right?
[1:05:52] <T_sarr> everything is edgelordy in ds3
[1:05:53] <Inebriateddonut> His armor is cold
[1:05:55] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 In continuity, it was a bad idea to build Sanctuary, because superpowered beings in a fragile mindset aren't being treated properly there. I'm imagining someone pulling the strings behind trying to tear them apart from within like Dr. Destiny
[1:06:06] <%superc37> i like how you can hear ariandeo whipping himself in the background even tho he technically shouldnt have the whip
[1:06:08] <Fujiwara_92> Lady Maria @conlin_plays
[1:06:09] <+Kongro_> Yeah, the twitch app is a big waste of space.
[1:06:13] <+terry_quest> dang streaming so late?
[1:06:15] <+Higgsworth> Some streamers I watch start reading messages before they pop up for me, its so freaky.
[1:06:18] <+alphonseisbest> how does chroma prime differ fro.m og chroma?
[1:06:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> that's like wearing a football helmet with a turtleneck
[1:06:25] <Sanyle> @alphonseisbest eh i mean i got really heated but i mean i did the research and it all ended in a conclusive circle for me so they can go suck a dick lol
[1:06:27] <T_sarr> pat breaks the little girls chair
[1:06:28] <$FriedMattato> Is it bad I never beat DS1 or 3, but I did beat DS2?
[1:06:28] <TheBigO75> says the man streaming at 7 am
[1:06:29] <+whiskywolfe> What’s Pat’s reason for his insomnia today?
[1:06:36] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It's not insomnia
[1:06:38] <Scotaku> It's 12:30 mid-day in the UK, I'm at college god dammit.
[1:06:39] <%axellogic> im going to bed you loser
[1:06:40] <%SmolBluGhost> Im off work today heck yeah apatDab
[1:06:42] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He's actually slept well for once
[1:06:43] <Goldenwolf98> @alphonseisbest better stats thats basically how all primes work
[1:06:45] <$RubberFistFight> @whiskywolfe he fell asleep at 9pm and got a full 8 hours ?
[1:06:46] <+anar_bael> Good blood, I just woke up what are you doing streaming?
[1:06:49] <%Dragonfang1337> i sure as fuck aint getting out of bed to get on my pc though
[1:06:51] <$RubberFistFight> no insomnia
[1:06:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> GIT GUD
[1:06:55] <Cobalt_Plated14> @plagueofgripes And if I saw a man running at me in a football helmet and turtleneck I would be scared shitless.
[1:06:55] <+Solutha> kill
[1:06:56] <+whiskywolfe> Like arse it’s not insomnia
[1:07:01] <Fujiwara_92> ca,'st
[1:07:01] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 i dont know if the problems i have sanctuary are supposed to be problems considering how me and king dont usually see eye to eye
[1:07:02] <+DZiffer> I love the scythe you get in this DLC, statwise it's all over the place, just like my character, it was a perfect match
[1:07:03] <%yet_another_brony> put some damn shoes on lady its snowing out there
[1:07:06] <+Belakitu> CUMST
[1:07:06] <Jarvanii> WHOMST

[1:07:15] <+terry_quest> why so early?
[1:07:16] <%SolitudeOtM> do a Paige and kill her
[1:07:17] <the_mental_punk> i have that probley now where its too close to when i need to wake up that i dont know if i should bother sleeping
[1:07:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> why are you up so early Pat? is it time 4 skuul?

[1:07:28] <+Kongro_> rise and shine
[1:07:31] <$RubberFistFight> PREPARE YOUR RETINAS
[1:07:38] <%SmolBluGhost> but awe hell am i sleepy
[1:07:40] <+Kirbachev> I hate when Flux borks. It's eye-wrenching.
[1:07:42] <+whiskywolfe> All Chernobyl Babies have insomnia
[1:07:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Who's up before school?
[1:07:49] <+Buytoast> not going to fight the three wise crabs?
[1:07:49] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> i just keep flux in warm colours all day
[1:07:52] <Spiderfacev> doesn't windows 10 have a function like flux built in?
[1:07:53] <+mastertwin2> wrong side LUL
[1:07:54] <%envy1499> Her scythe is my favorite weapon
[1:07:56] <Jarvanii> your eyeballs have grown weak from too much flux
[1:07:56] <SPidERMan8576> pat is awake early today
[1:07:59] <Goldenwolf98> OTHERSIDE FOOL
[1:07:59] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 Seeing as it's also written by Tom King, Mister Miracle ends on a weird note that he is either in Hell, Heaven or even in the Anti-Life Equation. I can see him returning in some fashion there. Also they kinda have to set up the state of teh world that is in Doomsday Clock whcih is supposed to set place 6 months or so in the future where superhero trust has fallen way down
[1:08:00] <+megamonmon123> if guts was in dark souls would he be a forever undead or would he have hollowed out?
[1:08:03] <$RubberFistFight> four billion lumens shoved directly into two one-inch-square sections of your face
[1:08:04] <%Tearonex> wrong side
[1:08:04] <%superc37> @fireking900 not her dad, its father as in priest, just like how shes called "sister" friede.
[1:08:05] <+Kirbachev> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 Not really an option if you do any digital arting
[1:08:08] <Fluxraw> what is all this talk about flux?
[1:08:10] <Inebriateddonut> you did it
[1:08:11] <%SolitudeOtM> your on the wrong side
[1:08:11] <+Solutha> Pat made an oopsie
[1:08:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Other side, silly.
[1:08:18] <ConLin_Plays> LUL
[1:08:18] <+anar_bael> can someone tell me when Pat started?
[1:08:21] <$RubberFistFight> @megamonmon123 Guts IS in Dark Souls. Only he's named Artorias.
[1:08:23] <+whiskywolfe> Lmao
[1:08:25] <Scotaku> 6:30am.
[1:08:31] <%SmolBluGhost> bout an hour ago
[1:08:43] <Cobalt_Plated14> @rubberfistfight Truth.
[1:08:44] <+mastertwin2> @RubberFistFight Or Gael, if you want to be more recent
[1:08:49] <+Solutha> Slave knight w/e is more of a guts
[1:08:52] <Fujiwara_92> 10:30am
[1:08:58] <Inebriateddonut> Those things take extra damage in the air
[1:08:58] <SPidERMan8576> i cant believe pat woke up early for work
[1:08:59] <teflonbilly777> @anar_bael We need a bot for last time Pat sharted, or as he calls it "Sat in chocolate"
[1:09:00] <+driedputty> @RubberFistFight Artorias lost. Gatzu is still at it.
[1:09:03] <+Higgsworth> Is there a reason you're doing an entire play through with Vordt's mace exclusively?
[1:09:10] <+anar_bael> Ok cool, cause I though he had been going since like 3 am or something
[1:09:16] <fireking900> @superc37 you know. that makes way more sense then them being related LUL ty
[1:09:22] <RamenRiderZ> Because Vordst hammer
[1:09:23] <+whiskywolfe> Btw of anybody has yet to see the NEW Sonic movie poster, check that shit out at once
[1:09:24] <fireking900> +
[1:09:27] <%crowsloft77> Slave night is normal Gatsu and Artorias is Gats with the Berserk armor activated
[1:09:28] <+Higgsworth> Well, that makes sense I guess LUL
[1:09:29] <teflonbilly777> Pat just wants to be big like Vordt
[1:09:30] <+QuadraticGravity> if this is first time on DLC should always test new shit
[1:09:31] <RamenRiderZ> *mace
[1:09:35] <$RubberFistFight> @driedputty fair point. Artorias was modeled directly after Guts in his Berzerker armor though
[1:09:41] <the_mental_punk> double great swords
[1:09:41] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Dude, that Sonic poster is a work of art!
[1:09:45] <%Keeble24> It is?!
[1:09:46] <Nyacromancer> you looked into the camera like a character from The Office
[1:09:46] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you don't really try weapons it seems
[1:09:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat you're a creature of excessive habit
[1:09:49] <+Buytoast> does he know about the npc pyromancer battle in pricilla's old boss room here?
[1:09:56] <Fujiwara_92> fuck that other poster, why u do nothing Sega FeelsBadMan
[1:09:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know what else is a good weapon? Mah dikk @angriestpat
[1:10:04] <teflonbilly777> DUAL WIRELD SCIMITARS
[1:10:04] <%envy1499> Double axes are fun. Spin to win
[1:10:04] <T_sarr> the torch
[1:10:07] <Goldenwolf98> DUAL SHIELDS Kappa
[1:10:07] <+Higgsworth> It wasn't a dig or anything, I was just wondering. Never seen it used before really.
[1:10:08] <%Taisuru> DRAGON TOOTH
[1:10:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> there's a lot of large weapons pat
[1:10:09] <Inebriateddonut> Switch to bandit knife
[1:10:10] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Vordt's Hammer is fine
[1:10:10] <%8BitDsx> I think people are forgetting you've beaten this game like 3 times
[1:10:11] <kazadog> great club is technically better in most aspects
[1:10:12] <grayjammer> @AngriestPat What about the Quakehammer once you get that in this DLC?
[1:10:15] <+jt427> I love the exiled great sword
[1:10:17] <%8BitDsx> Even in LP form.
[1:10:19] <kazadog> but vordts is frosty so....
[1:10:19] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Torch build GO!
[1:10:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> wait why do you have so few weapons.
[1:10:22] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat great club has better scaling if i remember properly
[1:10:25] <+whiskywolfe> The new one is actually a good idea but ... it’s got Sonic’s body in it.
[1:10:26] <T_sarr> the large one
[1:10:26] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat use what you want to use, man. It's your game.
[1:10:26] <%pseudograe> Torch
[1:10:27] <+YabbaTroll> wait is this an early morning stream or a extremely late at night stream?
[1:10:27] <%envy1499> DOUBLE AXES
[1:10:28] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat THE GREATSWORD
[1:10:28] <Inebriateddonut> BANDIT KNIFE STRENGTH
[1:10:29] <Fujiwara_92> dual estocs Kappa
[1:10:31] <Fynale> @AngriestPat what about the dual greatswords from the other dlc
[1:10:31] <MonstersDogma> Went through this dlc with the gargoyle flame hammer. Felt fitting
[1:10:33] <+driedputty> Yhorm's?
[1:10:34] <fragdar> use the guts sword
[1:10:34] <+YabbaTroll> !uptime
[1:10:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 10m 37s.
[1:10:40] <%superc37> Ledo's hammer?
[1:10:40] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 possible but i have no faith, especially with the last page reveal of batman 50
[1:10:42] <Golden_Battler> Tbh I like what you're using right now
[1:10:43] <jack_s1n> whip
[1:10:44] <T_sarr> no we're saying torch
[1:10:44] <Amberizing> yhorm's weapon is neat
[1:10:45] <kazadog> for pve it doesnt atter
[1:10:47] <the_mental_punk> use a weapon not for your build
[1:10:48] <Insanewayne253> FUGS
[1:10:48] <%MrDrayko> Fat Knight in Lorthric
[1:10:49] <ConLin_Plays> Torch!
[1:10:51] <kazadog> matter*
[1:10:52] <%Dragonfang1337> Sega intentionally killing the sonic brand so they can replace it with PersonaYakuza
[1:10:53] <+DZiffer> Torch!
[1:10:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> by the giant in shitty giant tower
[1:10:55] <jack_s1n> use whip
[1:10:56] <kazadog> ledos would be fun though
[1:10:57] <%envy1499> YOU GET THEM BEFORE LORIEN
[1:10:59] <+mastertwin2> Try the Earth Seeker greataxe in this DLC
[1:10:59] <%envy1499> THE ANGELS
[1:10:59] <+RushUnplugged> stop using thing you like pat, use the thing stream wants
[1:11:00] <MainMan_Jonadiah> TORCHES!
[1:11:00] <grayjammer> The double axes suck ass
[1:11:00] <+megamonmon123> duel wield like a weeb
[1:11:06] <+Higgsworth> I didn't mean to start a debate, fug my life
[1:11:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh, axes, not maces. then in lothric
[1:11:12] <+Kirbachev> @Dragonfang1337 There really is no other explanation for that film
[1:11:12] <+KawaiiJetty> The double axes are from the winged knight in lothric after dancers
[1:11:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FISTS ONLY
[1:11:16] <Fujiwara_92> use smough hammer
[1:11:19] <%SolitudeOtM> The Grestsword is hands down the most powerful str weapon, and the Winged Knight Twin Axes are like 2nd
[1:11:20] <Caidezes> Just use the dandruff stick.
[1:11:21] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Can you tell Paige shewas great at the podcast? Please invete her more!
[1:11:22] <MonstersDogma> The fatty in lothric. Fantastic weapon
[1:11:22] <T_sarr> yes its the fiery one
[1:11:23] <%envy1499> The angel guards have double axes
[1:11:24] <swansong118> @AngriestPat ok, get a great axe, enchant it with fire, then throw it away
[1:11:26] <grayjammer> You Gotta Grind Them
[1:11:30] <%superc37> Oh also you get the dual axes by farming the blue angels in lothric
[1:11:31] <Inebriateddonut> Just use the thrall axe in your inventory
[1:11:32] <+Deft_Thought> Is the Greathammer that these guys use any good? I never touched it.
[1:11:33] <+KawaiiJetty> Yeah random drop
[1:11:34] <fragdar> Greatsword.. do a guts cosplay
[1:11:34] <jack_s1n> whip that little bitch in the eye
[1:11:38] <Insanewayne253> Fume Ultra Greatsword
[1:11:41] <+megamonmon123> yes paige was amazing on the podcast, especially when she was making u
[1:11:45] <RetributionP> you farm them from fat spinny knight
[1:11:46] <kazadog> we all know what happened last time pat tried to grind for an axe
[1:11:47] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat the golden wing knights drop em
[1:11:50] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I ahted issue 50, but I really enjoyed the issues after. Like the arc where Bruce is doing jury duty. Or Nightwing trying to cheer Batman up. Or the reintroduction of KGBeast. King seems to have a plan
[1:11:51] <the_mental_punk> demon fist
[1:11:56] <%Dragonfang1337> SOUL of the BLOOD of the WOLF
[1:12:03] <%SmolBluGhost> ah yes...that shit
[1:12:08] <+KawaiiJetty> Double axes are fun to use, big damage with proper rings too
[1:12:13] <yakuzarick> !uptime
[1:12:13] <%SolitudeOtM> Fume SUCKS now
[1:12:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 12m 15s.
[1:12:13] <medril07> why are people on these roots?
[1:12:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, I forgot how cool this location is.
[1:12:24] <%envy1499> Gotta stick near your roots
[1:12:26] <%envy1499> Eyyy
[1:12:27] <teflonbilly777> KILL TEH LIZARD!
[1:12:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> put on a bunch of enchanted jewelry and PUNCH the enemies
[1:12:35] <yakuzarick> only an hour I was worried he played all night
[1:12:35] <enoughmold> @AngriestPat use the special Darksouls brand swiss army knife
[1:12:44] <+driedputty> Cause what else is there to do during the snow-pocalypse?
[1:12:51] <+mastertwin2> followers are so cool it's a shame their shield sucks
[1:12:53] <%Keeble24> They’re trying to get to the root of the problem
[1:12:59] <Fynale> @AngriestPat i didn't play ds3 how well did the changing weapons to scale to different stats work out?
[1:12:59] <%envy1499> Nice
[1:12:59] <+Belakitu> OW YOUR ANKLE
[1:13:12] <%Chichen> but how can this be
[1:13:15] <%Chichen> i dont understand
[1:13:24] <%envy1499> Change weapons for extra style points
[1:13:36] <Fujiwara_92> I'll watch this later bye ppl, have fun with your stick pat PunOko
[1:13:39] <%Chichen> man, imagine a souls type game with a style meter
[1:13:42] <teflonbilly777> Dark Souls with a style rank system
[1:13:43] <Fujiwara_92> KonCha
[1:13:44] <$beardeddragon72> hey pat i just got off a 10 hour overnight shift and have an appointment at 9:30, as the all ruling king of horrible sleep decisons should i sleep before my appointment or power through'

[1:13:50] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 the trail was fine, his nightwing is off and i dont like what he had happen to dick and i dont like that he left kgbeast to die out of spite instead of despiration. yes he has a plan but i dont like bis plan. he is doing a deconstruction and reconstruction of am elseworlds batman but it's in continuity

[1:16:11] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I would've been a bit more salty about this whole deconstruction of Batman if hadn't been for all teh grimdark Batmans we were exposed to during Metal. A crossover I didn't mind, but did make me kinda yearn for some fundemental change in Bruce. "Ric" Grayson is terrible. I enjoyed his Nightwing, but Dick Grayson is supposed to be the shining light of the DC universe. The dude even Superman looks to when things look their bleakest
[1:16:19] <grayjammer> I love you, crab
[1:16:21] <%envy1499> Dual axes are strength. Plus they spin to win
[1:16:22] <MainMan_Jonadiah> MAD HEAVY

[1:16:39] <RetributionP> what about the spiked mace for the cool weapon art
[1:16:40] <%captaindepthperception> Style sounds like something that would work with bloodborne activating passive buffs on movements and parries
[1:16:42] <cant_pick_a_name> why is pat streaming at 7 in the morning

[1:16:49] <+whiskywolfe> Ice Crab is laziest enemy in the game. I hate it so much.
[1:16:53] <MonstersDogma> For real those dual axes are a great strength weapon. I got them on a lucky drop one time and loved them so much I used them the rest of the game
[1:16:54] <+driedputty> Shame you can't wield a crab claw.
[1:16:57] <+Buytoast> two hand a broken straight sword

[1:18:55] <$beardeddragon72> poor crab :(
[1:18:56] <%8BitDsx> The Firelink Greatsword is pretty rad.
[1:19:02] <%SolitudeOtM> it's been nerfed for a long time
[1:19:02] <+JustSayAnything> cocky crustaceans
[1:19:06] <RamenRiderZ> The 1 handed axe is cool, it has the roar skill the battle axe has but it also has a running animation
[1:19:07] <MonstersDogma> It’s way fuckin lighter
[1:19:12] <SaikaMercenary> earth seeker does scale with strength
[1:19:12] <$beardeddragon72> his time was too short
[1:19:13] <+driedputty> Was that guy purple?
[1:19:15] <LeaIsChill> Woah!
[1:19:17] <kazadog> fune would be great if pat was good enough to blockswap
[1:19:18] <Goldenwolf98> Why does DS2 have such a better variety of weapons to use in it that DS3?
[1:19:26] <fireking900> Dose he have the dragon stand yet? use that
[1:19:28] <irontatsumi> dandruff stick not cutting it anymore?
[1:19:36] <%superc37> Firelinks got 10 faith n int req tho
[1:19:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> does he have an FP Caestus offhand yet
[1:19:41] <youthfulcrustacean> Pat wtf why are you up so early
[1:19:41] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Did you have breakfast? Make sure you eat something in the morning so you won't overdoit at lunchtime
[1:19:45] <+megamonmon123> @goldenwolf98 probably cause of the weapon arts
[1:19:53] <Cobalt_Plated14> Weird question, but what’s your opinion on JoJo Eyes of Heaven?

[1:19:59] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 Nah, just some growth to him. His relationship with Selina hinted to that, but then King botched that completely. Then the jury arc right after gave us a look into the psyche of a depressed Bruce outside of the MUH MOM AND DAD trauma. His stint with Nightwing seemed to be a way to tackle that, but then he got shot in the dome and is now on a rage bender. Him beating up a catatonic Bane and punching Gordon is Batman lashing out in anger without any purpose and it's kinda interestin
[1:19:59] <Inebriateddonut> I did like that DS2 wasn't afraid to get absolutely NUTS with its weapons
[1:20:03] <%around_40_jobbers> Only cowards use anything but the winged spear
[1:20:03] <T_sarr> boo this man
[1:20:06] <kazadog> @PlagueOfGripes fp caestus got nerfed you actually need to pay full price for weapon arts for them to be good
[1:20:07] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Firelink Greatsword is kinda garbo, which sucks cuz it's really cool.
[1:20:07] <Richmond_> THE PEOPLE WANT THE DOORS
[1:20:08] <%envy1499> Axes dad
[1:20:08] <TsunTsuchinoko> black knight weapons are cool

[1:20:14] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 but jts n
[1:20:23] <%8BitDsx> Hey I said it was rad, not good. There's a difference.
[1:20:26] <%Tearonex> Dragon Bone Smasher?
[1:20:27] <%TheGreatBamBe> did I miss a 7 hour stream?
[1:20:27] <MonstersDogma> I’d still really suggest going with the winged knight dual axes
[1:20:30] <+KawaiiJetty> Reaching 689 AR with a decent double axe setup is gud
[1:20:30] <%Keeble24> DOORS?
[1:20:30] <Inebriateddonut> There's the black knight stuff
[1:20:33] <brambobelurkin> Black knight great axe
[1:20:35] <34thLab> Use the Caestus you coward
[1:20:42] <+Bouerd> Greataxe is fun
[1:20:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> There's two axes that look like they're in need of dual weilding
[1:20:45] <+mastertwin2> Black Knight Greataxe is SUPER high AR and really cool
[1:20:47] <Goldenwolf98> I say black knight great axe
[1:20:49] <kazadog> caestus is unironically a great weapon
[1:20:51] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 what we arent experiencing isnt really growth right now but things that have been done before but with worse justification
[1:20:54] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I'm not saying he's killing it, but he's caught my interest, which I can't say for a lot of other comics about the big heroes lately
[1:20:56] <Raishiro> murakumo!
[1:20:57] <wowthisnamecanbequitelong> The basic Greataxe is big damage with no range
[1:20:59] <$beardeddragon72> exile greatsword!
[1:20:59] <brambobelurkin> 1 for great axe 2 for Smoughs 3 for greatswords
[1:21:02] <RetributionP> Yea Black night greataxe
[1:21:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> man I liked the 2h moveset for the BK greataxe in 1
[1:21:07] <SaikaMercenary> BK Greatsword
[1:21:10] <fireking900> Black Knight anything sounds fun
[1:21:10] <zambba123> greataxe!

[1:21:18] <Jarvanii> black knight greataxe in 1 was goat
[1:21:19] <kazadog> bkga with bonewheel shield
[1:21:24] <+mastertwin2> Greataxe is the exact same as in DS1
[1:21:27] <brambobelurkin> get dat axe
[1:21:29] <$RubberFistFight> i think the BKGA has some of the highest potential damage output in the game, if your build is right
[1:21:31] <+Bouerd> BKGA needs Dex
[1:21:32] <%crimsonharvest> the BKHalberd is still my fave
[1:21:42] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 the fact that he suggested that batman became batman to kill himself shows he sees batman waaaaay differently to me and alot of people
[1:21:44] <+KawaiiJetty> Dual axes or Greataxe, i enjoy simplicity on the latter
[1:21:44] <%SolitudeOtM> it's pretty good
[1:21:50] <%crimsonharvest> oh hey look at my cute elmo icon
[1:21:52] <Jarvanii> black knight greataxe in 1 had a weaker but faster r1 than other greataxes tho
[1:21:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ooh, Fume Ultra Greatsword, tho

[1:22:09] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I know everybody hates Knightfall, it's terrible. But yeah, we've seen Bruce strained to the limit like this before. I don't see King pulling the same gimmick with Bane this time, even if it is familiar
[1:22:18] <Inebriateddonut> Love the charged heavy for the launch
[1:22:18] <RetributionP> no
[1:22:19] <MadOx__> you need 18 dex for some of the weapons

[1:22:29] <katocrimson> do a guts cosplay

[1:22:35] <Sanyle> holy shit i literally finished ds1 the other night with that weapon

[1:24:29] <%SolitudeOtM> *should
[1:24:29] <+mastertwin2> Cathedral Knight Greatsword has a stab, though
[1:24:31] <R3TURNoftheMACK> go for a jog then Kappa
[1:24:33] <+whiskywolfe> Plague you’re clearly enjoying this, you should give this the old streamydoo
[1:24:35] <34thLab> That's why Guts fights naked half the time
[1:24:43] <Sonicdy> BIG SWOOD
[1:24:46] <rXpCH> cool, dark souls finally in smash !
[1:24:51] <+Bouerd> Cathedral knight GS does blunt damage
[1:24:54] <T_sarr> cathedral's way better
[1:24:55] <%envy1499> Just read up to book 12 in berserk manga. Ordering 13 soon
[1:24:57] <grayjammer> Cathedral Greatsword is BIG GRINDING
[1:24:59] <RetributionP> you didn't weapon art the great axe
[1:25:00] <+alphonseisbest> pat say to the big axe or tje big boy sword?
[1:25:04] <Jarvanii> astora is big lunge
[1:25:05] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Stormruler build???
[1:25:10] <%SolitudeOtM> Cathedral knights Greatsword R1 combos with R2
[1:25:13] <+megamonmon123> @envy1499 dont rush to catch up
[1:25:13] <Goldenwolf98> Fuck it just use the Uchi Kappa
[1:25:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> astora greatsword is also good
[1:25:20] <+mastertwin2> yeah there's like 2 cathedral greatsword knights in the game
[1:25:20] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 Yeah, that was awful. King is inferring way to much of his personal insecurities into Bruce, but the situation he's put him in now, kinda makes it work
[1:25:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> also a beautiful weapon
[1:25:23] <Sanyle> so which greatsword is literally just a gigantic iron slab on a hilt?
[1:25:27] <%Tearonex> ye, you dont have it, you NEED to grind for Cathedral
[1:25:31] <%SolitudeOtM> Astoria greatsword is a DeX weapon
[1:25:33] <kazadog> astoras kinda bad for strength
[1:25:38] <Inebriateddonut> Astora is amazing looking
[1:25:39] <+alphonseisbest> @envy14envwhere u stop at story wise?
[1:25:40] <%SolitudeOtM> astora
[1:25:46] <kazadog> astora is for elemental and dex mostly
[1:25:51] <+mastertwin2> try the weapon art, its a charge
[1:25:51] <shozent> @PlagueOfGripes Is that your Swordfu?
[1:25:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> use its art
[1:25:53] <Inebriateddonut> Also the closest we'll ever get to half-swording in DS
[1:25:57] <fireking900> Dose he have the 2handed katana? The washing pole or something
[1:25:58] <RetributionP> weapon art fuck pa5
[1:26:04] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat check out the weapon art on Astora
[1:26:05] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 right, like i said, king is deconstructing and reconstructing an elseworlds batman and it doesnt work in continuity cause its so fundimentally warped
[1:26:12] <chancho4tierra> cathedral greatsword and use the fricking weapon arts
[1:26:18] <T_sarr> its the biggest
[1:26:30] <grayjammer> TIME FOR GRINDEING
[1:26:33] <RetributionP> it's the fume but lighter
[1:26:34] <+mastertwin2> BIG GRIND TIME
[1:26:36] <%SmolBluGhost> yey
[1:26:36] <%envy1499> @angriestpat google dual axes
[1:26:41] <FrostyLionEh> Isn't this mega early in the morning for you Pat Kappa
[1:26:51] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 I have always enjoyed the dichotomy between teh benevolent Bruce Wayne who would sacrifice himself so nobody ever has to live through seeing their parents shot like he did, to the control freak Bruce who would wield fear and superstition so nobody would experience the same thing he did
[1:26:56] <%SmolBluGhost> adventure
[1:27:08] <T_sarr> mimic-kun

[1:28:43] <+RushUnplugged> SPIN
[1:28:47] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 i also reject the idea that batman can only be happy with selina
[1:28:49] <shozent> Its like a guts
[1:28:54] <%SolitudeOtM> remember R1 combos into R2
[1:28:56] <+mastertwin2> Pat you press R2 not R1
[1:28:58] <kazadog> @AngriestPat tip for pvp the cathedral ugs 2h r1 true combos into the 2h r2
[1:28:58] <Fluxraw> its not only a stab, its a shieldbreaker if charged
[1:29:03] <fireking900> WEAPON ARTS PAT
[1:29:10] <+RushUnplugged> R1>R2
[1:29:10] <Inebriateddonut> Can equip hunter ring if you want
[1:29:12] <%SmolBluGhost> ART
[1:29:13] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Why do you have a calamity icon under your stamina?

[1:29:18] <RetributionP> pat fuck weapon art is R2
[1:29:22] <+overhaze> Pat what the heck time is it over there?
[1:29:33] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 Rebirth kinda gives us a way to reinterpret Batman though. I'm not crazy about the overall direction went about it, but I feel like he's finally lurching towards something cool
[1:29:36] <T_sarr> spin2win
[1:29:39] <shozent> Be about 8am or so
[1:29:39] <Inebriateddonut> @MainMan_Jonadiah that's the prisoner chain
[1:29:41] <MonstersDogma> It’s design is near identical to gut’s dragon slayer
[1:29:43] <%Tearonex> I used this sword with my strength build, god I love it
[1:29:50] <+mastertwin2> @MainMan_Jonadiah he has teh rusted chain on
[1:29:53] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 Well, they've kinda ruined Talia completely
[1:29:54] <%SmolBluGhost> what was astoras art tho
[1:30:10] <+mastertwin2> Astora's was the spear charge
[1:30:16] <%envy1499> Ye
[1:30:18] <%SmolBluGhost> right
[1:30:28] <kazadog> @SmolBluGhost charge wa like most of the spears have its ok
[1:30:29] <Goldenwolf98> Just eat a gods soul
[1:30:38] <Inebriateddonut> USE THE SOUL OF ALL OF DARK SOUL'S PLAYERS TO MAKE YOUR SWORD STRONGER
[1:30:40] <%SmolBluGhost> its been a minute
[1:30:45] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 And Wonder WOman/Bats ain't happening in main continuity. I still see Bruce ending up like Batman Beyond/Kingdom Come. An unhappy broken old man still waging a war without end
[1:30:51] <irontatsumi> cathedral knight GS is that?
[1:30:53] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 rebirth isnt a reboot though, it still continues from the new 52.
[1:31:14] <bear_breaker20> love how no one questions mimic
[1:31:17] <fragdar> why not up the greatsword (or other weapon you like just to have it.. if you wanna change latter is right there
[1:31:18] <Valask> it's 4 in the evening pat coxWat
[1:31:30] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 They pick and choose. Like remember the disaster that was Jim Gordon as Batman after Bruce got "reset" in Endgame
[1:31:38] <+megamonmon123> its less reinterpretation and more fundamentally changing the character @teflonbilly777
[1:31:43] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Full-time farming build

[1:36:34] <LGWPhanto> Pat hates fun

[1:36:35] <%foreverN2dust> but spin to win :(
[1:36:37] <+terry_quest> no fun allowed
[1:36:37] <kazadog> @Valask nah it sucks for pvp
[1:36:37] <teflonbilly777> I wish you could spin a chain like in Kung Pow
[1:36:39] <yakuzarick> he hates it
[1:36:39] <+overhaze> But why does Pat hate it?
[1:36:40] <spinbel> When did he start streaming?
[1:36:40] <durant_kdtrey> If Pat Hates it I hate it
[1:36:43] <+megamonmon123> is "pat hates that" his new catchphrase?
[1:36:44] <teflonbilly777> SWINGING A CHAIN
[1:36:47] <%envy1499> Spin to win
[1:36:48] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I'm sorry axe people, but that spin was silly.
[1:36:49] <Inebriateddonut> Pat Hates at: Dark Souls 3 Weapons
[1:36:51] <%8BitDsx> !uptime
[1:36:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 36m 53s.
[1:36:51] <Valask> @kazadog I didn't say it would be good Kappa
[1:36:55] <Goldenwolf98> people you gotta remember Pat hates anything remotely fun and interesting to use Kappa
[1:36:57] <grayjammer> Every single move on the twinaxes feels like ass and doesnt have the decency tohave a good range to make up for it
[1:36:58] <Shooterboy23> Pat not gonna use Cavaliere in DMC5 i guess
[1:37:00] <T_sarr> get blessed
[1:37:07] <MonstersDogma> Man fuck you that weapons great
[1:37:13] <kazadog> @grayjammer but muh damage
[1:37:31] <LGWPhanto> If I can't spin like an idiot to kill things what's the point
[1:37:57] <grayjammer> @LGWPhanto Then use the Splitleaf instead, because it's a zillion times better
[1:38:02] <+megamonmon123> so have you guys been watching titans? it was sponsered on the podcast KappaHD
[1:38:17] <Mnightshyamallama> don't they have a chance of dropping a slab or am I crazy?
[1:38:19] <teflonbilly777> SEE HE'S SPINNING!
[1:38:24] <kazadog> @grayjammer especially with the infinit wa glitch
[1:38:25] <Inebriateddonut> @grayjammer nono the splitleaf only spins the wep
[1:38:25] <Shooterboy23> apparently titans is actually pretty good
[1:38:26] <T_sarr> he missed tho
[1:38:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> No, but I have been catching up on Inhumans @megamonmon123
[1:38:39] <TsunTsuchinoko> yes, they do
[1:38:41] <+megamonmon123> @shooterboy23 no its not trust me
[1:38:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I think it's like the first time you clear them out you get a slab.
[1:38:48] <wowthisnamecanbequitelong> The first time you kill all free you get a Slab guaranteed
[1:38:48] <cosmeleon> they give you a slab first time
[1:38:51] <%superc37> No, they dont.
[1:38:51] <+KawaiiJetty> 1st time yeah
[1:38:53] <fragdar> yo patch.. i just recently found out about your stream and your archives on youtube.. you are gonna finish your bloodborne playthrough?
[1:38:57] <+KawaiiJetty> After no.
[1:38:59] <Inebriateddonut> @grayjammer one must achieve complete body revolution for viability
[1:39:00] <+megamonmon123> @powerfulblackgangs a masochist i see
[1:39:12] <Shooterboy23> Well shit i was hoping it was
[1:39:17] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Why do anything halfway? Go for as bad as you can.
[1:39:20] <MonstersDogma> First time you kill all three they drop one
[1:39:28] <%foreverN2dust> = apatPorgmo
[1:39:28] <T_sarr> it's "Pure"
[1:39:33] <+megamonmon123> @shooterboy23 it will be better if you binge but the week to week kills it
[1:39:34] <%superc37> there not a single enemy in the game that has slabs in the normal drop rate.
[1:39:34] <grayjammer> @Inebriateddonut yeah but you have free movement on the splitleaf's spin so you can use your movement to manually spin instead
[1:39:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Elmo causing a rackett
[1:39:36] <durant_kdtrey> your character looks badass with that sword
[1:39:36] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 @PowerfulBlackGangs I would rather drive nails through my dick than watch those shows. Now playing Fallout 76 on the other hand!
[1:39:36] <%NovaKnightmare> you mean HIS controller

[1:40:24] <kazadog> @AngriestPat lothric ugs has the stab plus horizontal r1s
[1:40:30] <T_sarr> it's tony time
[1:40:34] <jmepik> also why the cathedral greatsword when you can use The Greatsword
[1:40:40] <jmepik> It's much better!
[1:40:48] <+megamonmon123> @shooterboy23 also the best characters so far are the guest characters and no, it would take a full uninterrupted season for me to like the main cast
[1:40:50] <kazadog> then cathedral is the way to go!
[1:41:03] <T_sarr> he's wrong
[1:41:06] <durant_kdtrey> Cathedral greatsword looks way cooler
[1:41:06] <jmepik> for full str, if you put heavy on it, it is IIRC
[1:41:12] <jmepik> same moveset
[1:41:16] <T_sarr> church power is the only power
[1:41:18] <jmepik> that is true
[1:41:20] <Shooterboy23> not really selling me on it being bad. sounds like its ok. @megamonmon123
[1:41:22] <kazadog> cathedral has less reach and damage
[1:41:25] <+neroame> Thanks Pat now I can ignore my job
[1:41:30] <teflonbilly777> CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!
[1:41:35] <fragdar> jesus man.. red bull in the morning?
[1:41:39] <+overhaze> Been a while since I played is the Estoc still the Bestoc?
[1:41:40] <kazadog> the greatsword r2 is its main saving grace but thats mostly pvp
[1:41:42] <irontatsumi> red bull at normal-time european
[1:41:42] <shozent> Pat, all this redbull cant be good for you
[1:41:43] <ConLin_Plays> NotLikeThis
[1:41:48] <irontatsumi> big hero
[1:41:48] <%Keeble24> this has got to be one of the best looking greatswords
[1:41:48] <jmepik> I mean I love the Berserk gs for obvious reasons but like
[1:41:50] <teflonbilly777> Pat should buttchug a Red Bull on stream
[1:41:54] <katocrimson> Pat should try and get a red bull sponsership
[1:41:55] <jmepik> IIRC it is the best UGS for pure damage
[1:41:59] <+megamonmon123> @shooterboy23 its not bad, its boring
[1:42:00] <SaikaMercenary> welp, i'm out, you wacky canadian, have fun
[1:42:02] <juicedmeats> greatsword has no stabs :/
[1:42:05] <Shooterboy23> redbull at 7am and you just woke up an hour ago? pat what is your life.
[1:42:06] <Fuji_Apples> coffee can be a good alternative
[1:42:09] <Caidezes> All this just because you people wanted another weapon.
[1:42:16] <Inebriateddonut> Greatsword has that wide swinging heavy which pat dislikes
[1:42:18] <jmepik> it has the overhead
[1:42:21] <RD_nx> I just saw a GOOD drawing of the human sonic on twitter and it's freaking me out
[1:42:21] <%envy1499> Coffees gross
[1:42:23] <jmepik> the same overhead
[1:42:24] <Shining_Armor> Why the ever loving heck is is Pat streaming at 5 AM?
[1:42:24] <+megamonmon123> also starfire is still wearing her set hooker costume @shooterboy23
[1:42:25] <KaiserMario> Is Pat still breast-feeding?
[1:42:26] <T_sarr> stab>swing
[1:42:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> You know what's better than both greatswords? Muh' fuckin' doors!
[1:42:34] <+neroame> I need a Monster to watch you drink Red Bull
[1:42:34] <%Keeble24> OH GOD THAT SONIC MOVIE THO
[1:42:39] <+JustSayAnything> 1
[1:42:44] <+RushUnplugged> cathedral has the advantage of doing blunt damage, great vs all the slash-resistant enemies
[1:42:46] <cheaddos> is the strim edning_
[1:42:46] <%CrimsonCore90> Why does past look so energised?
[1:42:48] <Shooterboy23> @megamonmon123 the hooker set has good defense and gives you bonus in mana

[1:44:06] <Ayru_> look with your special eyes
[1:44:13] <jmepik> better AR, but mostly for PVP since no dark resist
[1:44:13] <+KawaiiJetty> Look at the eyes deeply
[1:44:13] <%BioApple> does Pat have any melanin in his eyes at all? Is he an android?
[1:44:18] <Shooterboy23> @Inebriateddonut shut up its legal now
[1:44:19] <%foreverN2dust> You're eyes actually are kinda pretty.
[1:44:19] <alrobot2014> @angriestpat shake your eyebags
[1:44:21] <jmepik> not so good against dark-resistant enemies
[1:44:21] <+PWNMAKER> Pat's faded
[1:44:21] <kazadog> @jmepik dark infusion is the best infusion for 90% of weapons
[1:44:39] <stigna1> Is this an early morning thing or a late-night thing? Because the hollow knight streams ran later than this.

[1:45:17] <LixFury> Games journalists arnt even relvent anymore LUL
[1:45:20] <Inebriateddonut> Why do people even take game journos/press seriously anymore?
[1:45:22] <$RubberFistFight> Shrieking that "git gud should be banned" is a great way to get fucking EVERYONE to shout it at you constantly, as a form of mockery, for your FUCKING STUPID STATEMENT.
[1:45:23] <alrobot2014> I'm not even gonna look up if this is a real thing
[1:45:28] <teflonbilly777> Dunkey was right about them
[1:45:28] <valriot> If your job is to PLAY games and review them, you should be good at them
[1:45:37] <shozent> >Possibly thousands Pat Pls
[1:45:39] <Mnightshyamallama> I get that they are supposed to be journalists first and sometimes they are put on games they don't really play much (like racing) but there has to be a level of competency.
[1:45:43] <+risenlp2> Yeah, anyone can fuck the dog at any time
[1:45:45] <Shooterboy23> You guys are disappointingly bad at devil may cry 3 and 4
[1:45:46] <+jestrfestr> they want games to be easy and short because of their job
[1:45:46] <caja_de_ojos> WHY NOW?
[1:45:51] <Caidezes> Yeah Pat. You suck.
[1:45:51] <jmepik> like when you whiff against jho? ye ye ye ye

[1:46:21] <T_sarr> except with woolie and ds2
[1:46:29] <+terry_quest> atleast grasp the basics of the game
[1:46:40] <Jarvanii> the feel of star trek from Digital Extremes
[1:46:42] <stigna1> Man, the woolie/ds2 thing was great. What a good game.
[1:46:43] <alrobot2014> yeah but you guys get better with at least a little time

[1:46:52] <reiju_22> Cuphead
[1:46:54] <+filthyheretichorus> or that cuphead video
[1:46:56] <JoeyDDT> Cuphead
[1:46:56] <+Shaggnar> God Hand review
[1:46:57] <Shooterboy23> that video belongs in a museum
[1:46:58] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Cuphead jumping
[1:46:59] <+jestrfestr> play path of exile for complicated
[1:47:02] <%foreverN2dust> How about that cuphead
[1:47:03] <LixFury> or the cuphead vid
[1:47:04] <%foreverN2dust> yeyeye
[1:47:08] <+risenlp2> I wonder if the virtuoso, 10k hour rule applies to our VG careers. Where we just have an innate understanding of things in new games.
[1:47:13] <%Prophet_v3> pls tell me he just woke up
[1:47:17] <Goldenwolf98> HOW THO
[1:47:17] <%envy1499> The dark souls of dark souls
[1:47:17] <Inebriateddonut> Games like God Hand suffer from game journos
[1:47:23] <fireking900> Or the Dead Cells guy
[1:47:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "Cuphead Guy" is that guys new name forever, and I love it.
[1:47:31] <%foreverN2dust> Five years? LUL
[1:47:34] <+overhaze> The Doom video was mystifying. Its like Arthur had never picked up a controller before.
[1:47:35] <Caidezes> WOw. Pat's really trying to be nice.
[1:47:37] <Shooterboy23> most game journalist are guys who went to school to be editors at TIME magazine or some shit.
[1:47:39] <%Fenrirlives> Hey am I too late? I just woke up!
[1:47:41] <Goldenwolf98> How do you get into game journalism without playing games LUL

[1:47:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 47m 55s.
[1:47:55] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut what gets me is how games "journalism" is now openly spiteful towards and scornful of gamers.
[1:47:56] <@Volta_Bass> Or the guy that bought Mario Party instead of Ultimate
[1:48:02] <Shooterboy23> @Goldenwolf98 same way david cage is a failed movie director
[1:48:02] <+filthyheretichorus> 8am Pat is scary nice

[1:48:30] <%Fenrirlives> lmaoooo nice!
[1:48:35] <@Volta_Bass> @foreverN2dust Check Kotaku. Game Journo bought Mario Party instead of Ultimate by mistake
[1:48:39] <+VanaSkiller> I recently watched the original one because of the thing you did with Plague
[1:48:42] <Shooterboy23> This is the exact reason I hate youtube reviewers like Angry Joe
[1:48:44] <narusao> context matters
[1:48:48] <+jestrfestr> it was trash either way
[1:48:50] <%foreverN2dust> Of course it's Kotaku LUL

[1:48:53] <Bailey__gaming> Hey everyone, Hi @AngriestPat Good Morning?!! im not sure what time it is for you! hope your ok
[1:48:58] <Mr_216> #FixPUBG
[1:49:00] <Shooterboy23> review things you know nothing about
[1:49:11] <stigna1> @Bailey__gaming Mooorning! ^_^
[1:49:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They’re more activists than reviewers. Who remembers the Bayoneta 2 thing?
[1:49:30] <Jontman42> How much of a vacuum do you want me to review this? Like I don't understand what moving pictures are level of vacuum?
[1:49:30] <JacktheSleeper42> What was the Bayo 2 thing?
[1:49:33] <alrobot2014> what happened with bayo
[1:49:39] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat exactly - content does not exist in a vacuum. Whilst in some cases you can separate a piece of content from everything else around in, in most cases that's going to be difficult at best, and actively counterproductive and detrimental to your experience of it at worst.
[1:49:42] <Shining_Armor> Jornos wanted to bomb Bayo 2 for being sexy
[1:49:44] <teflonbilly777> I know the crew of Giant Bomb's tastes well enough to gauge their reactions to a game compared to mine much better than any review. Same goes for the Super Best Friends. We're familiar with their tastes
[1:49:46] <MadCrainProductions> For me people who review games they haven't finished is a huge pet peeve
[1:49:50] <Bailey__gaming> @stigna1 its 1 PM here Uk Rulez
[1:49:52] <%jiin6> Game journo are garbo tier
[1:49:53] <Shooterboy23> @AngriestPat you should cut this out and make it a separate video upload on yt
[1:50:03] <katocrimson> *cracks* *sips*
[1:50:04] <stigna1> @Bailey__gaming Aaaafternoon! ^_^
[1:50:09] <baesoora> are you just starting? :o
[1:50:11] <+Kirbachev> @jiin6 Can pretty much extend that to journalism as a whole, for the most part.
[1:50:12] <JacktheSleeper42> @Shining_Armor Please tell me you're joking.
[1:50:27] <+megamonmon123> where i live games cost $189
[1:50:30] <enoughmold> I Never really look at reviews
[1:50:30] <Goldenwolf98> @MadCrainProductions I think its fine to review games you havent finished cause some are long ass rpgs
[1:50:32] <ovan20> @AngriestPat the best "reviews" are tthe ones like TotalBiscuit did. Comment about the game over raw footage of the gameplay.
[1:50:44] <valriot> The value risk of games DEMANDS the person be compitant at informing the consumer
[1:50:47] <Shining_Armor> @JacktheSleeper42 Nope. A lot of jornos said it was sexist and they tried to bomb it.
[1:51:03] <kazadog> there is a bseline competency required and if you dont meet that the "git gud" is kinda justified
[1:51:04] <teflonbilly777> There's nothing wrong with gatekeeping when a skill ceiling is a prerequisite to a review
[1:51:07] <$RubberFistFight> On the flip side of the coin though, constant comparisons to other works can become excessive and bog down any attempt to examine whatever the piece of content is. You've got to find and strike a balance.
[1:51:10] <Jontman42> @ovan20 I miss TB
[1:51:10] <+ArchimerDreatect> consumer reviews for games *should* be recommendations to the purchase of the game. Petty journalist grandstanding over subjects they only know from the outside looking in, making fools themselves.
[1:51:11] <+Shaggnar> That's a problem with car reviewers too, at least for sports cars
[1:51:22] <stigna1> @RubberFistFight Pssh, that's the dark souls of gaming commentary.
[1:51:25] <+Kirbachev> @Shining_Armor Because how dare an incredibly capable and competent woman flaunt her femininity, amirite?

[1:51:28] <Caidezes> To be fair, lots of games play very differently from each other.

[1:51:29] <+HoloToast> Be like Jim Sterling, still does a good job even though he's trash at videogames

[1:51:32] <MadCrainProductions> @Goldenwolf98 that's a shit excuse though if you can't finish the game don't review it, it's like watching a 3 hour movie half way and saying oh "yeah the beginning is great but it's too long lol"
[1:51:36] <%TaifuDragon> PAT WHAT THE FUCK IT'S MIDNIGGHT IN AUSTRALIA
[1:51:37] <+QuadraticGravity> for Journalists it's more like a mechanic not being able to replace a part

[1:51:48] <Shining_Armor> @Kirbachev It was hilarious when it backfired
[1:51:49] <%BioApple> @Shining_Armor I distinctly remember Polygon's Bayo 2 review basically being "MAN I want to review this poorly but it's actually really good so I can't"

[1:53:54] <MadCrainProductions> Tech enthusiasts ate that vid up

[1:53:57] <Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat what time is it for you? hope your not too crazy today
[1:53:57] <%PalmtopNami> it is quite literally why im getting better at league.
[1:54:00] <%jiin6> Verge fucks up PC
[1:54:02] <%foreverN2dust> Thermal paste? Just use toothpaste and save money. Kappa
[1:54:09] <+megamonmon123> OH yeah i know the video
[1:54:10] <teflonbilly777> MORE THERMAL PASTE MEANS THE PC GOES FASTER
[1:54:12] <stigna1> Psssh, only PC elitists think they're too good to not waste 500$ on scorched metal.
[1:54:15] <doctor_be> The worst video is the one that shopped the thermal paste into a tube of mayo
[1:54:16] <@Volta_Bass> "I'm incompetent be nice"
[1:54:25] <+ArchimerDreatect> bam^
[1:54:26] <Ayru_> you talk for a living
[1:54:28] <Holycow8498> I'm not really new here i just don't come here often
[1:54:32] <%BioApple> toothpaste? just put an ice cube on your cpu
[1:54:33] <%crimsonharvest> A boring review is harmless but a factually wrong guide is a menace
[1:54:34] <Goldenwolf98> @MadCrainProductions If you cant figure out if a game is good or not without finishing it I dont know that seems like there is a problem with the game like if you get 10 hours in and you cant tell if you like the game I dont think its a great game honestly but hey thats my opinion
[1:54:36] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "I'm all about bees, cubes, and rescubibing."

[1:55:45] <%SolitudeOtM> yes
[1:55:45] <ovan20> @megamonmon123 the best part is that they said it was ok because they corrected the mistakes, even if the corrections weren't in the video LUL

[1:56:26] <mechagrover> do you ever drink monster?
[1:56:26] <+filthyheretichorus> So if we're a gang, do we get jackets and combs?
[1:56:31] <Holycow8498> Did you ever see the video were Stephen Fry i believe it is gets shagged by a rare Pierrot
[1:56:31] <jmepik> Heavy Greatsword with 66 STR is 676 AR, without rings and stuff
[1:56:33] <Goldenwolf98> @alphonseisbest I mean I know how to play games I cant be a game reviewer LUL
[1:56:37] <Vroom0> You look like a big baby man to me ❤️
[1:56:43] <teflonbilly777> Pat, are you too young to appreciate Kids In The Hall? That's what taught me the most about Canada as a kid
[1:56:43] <stigna1> @filthyheretichorus And a secret handshake!
[1:56:44] <$RubberFistFight> @stigna1 excessive cheeriness and stumbling over words can be the first symptoms of a cerebral event. aka a stroke. PAT IS YOUR BRAIN OK.
[1:56:45] <doctor_be> Youll be back, they all come back
[1:56:47] <jmepik> don't remember what the best build for it is tbh, but I do remember 66 STR being sort of the soft cap for that
[1:57:05] <jack_s1n> but you love cube!
[1:57:08] <baesoora> taking naps, what im best at
[1:57:09] <Inebriateddonut> Studying is like leveling up in an RPG
[1:57:24] <+QuadraticGravity> BRB pat I'm gonna watch some guy play ranked rainbow six siege with a wiimote
[1:57:26] <%Keeble24> maybe i missed it, but have you already played Dead Cells Pat?
[1:57:27] <+alphonseisbest> @goldenwolfgolnow thats a damn good response!!
[1:57:28] <doctor_be> what does that make term papers?
[1:57:29] <Silent_Fyraena> No you fuck off :P
[1:57:31] <%foreverN2dust> zoneBork souls
[1:57:33] <Bailey__gaming> Love ya pat!
[1:57:35] <+filthyheretichorus> @RubberFistFight and a simple code to our hideout that we play a game of hide and seek in clocktown to.....opps wrong game
[1:57:38] <+blackkanye> Why am I up? I usually sleep in the morning! FUU
[1:57:46] <MadCrainProductions> @Goldenwolf98 yeah I get what you're saying also I wanna emphasize it's a pet peeve, I get that reviewers can't be assed to finish a 100 hour game cause they have 50 other games they have to review. But the issue isn't if it's good or not it's more of playing something that is about stories essentially and then only getting half way but still either recommending it or saying it's bad, like if I just made a 200 hours game and made the first 50 fun cause I know reviewers aren't gonna go past it, t
[1:57:47] <medril07> how's the estoc run going?
[1:57:56] <stigna1> @Keeble24 I don't *think* he ever streamed it, but the 2bfp crew are big fans of the game.
[1:57:59] <%envy1499> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhand
[1:58:00] <fragdar> EEEEEEEEEEEY
[1:58:03] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat no that's just the stroke setting in
[1:58:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> There's a difference between sleeping after you study and studying at the end of the day when you are exhausted and can't think straight
[1:58:11] <jack_s1n> whip run yeah
[1:58:16] <sileo_patronus> The physical habit of hitting the chest is m ore reliable than the visual habit of comparing models to be fair @AngriestPat
[1:58:16] <+Townspoon> wtf is this ungodly hour
[1:58:31] <doctor_be> Normal people hours
[1:58:37] <%Keeble24> @stigna1 i know for sure woolie did stream it, but thanks for the info. it would be cool if he did
[1:58:38] <$RubberFistFight> @Townspoon there are no gods at this hour, only PATRICK
[1:58:38] <Lunarmight> !follow
[1:58:50] <$spleekle> Did you wake up early, or you up all night, Pat
[1:58:56] <%foreverN2dust> @Townspoon pat woke up at a normal person time today
[1:58:59] <Holycow8498> Wait they have Smough and Oristeins helmets in this game
[1:59:05] <stigna1> @Keeble24 Always glad to help! ^_^ Did Wools do the stream integration thing, 'cuz that sounds fun.
[1:59:07] <medril07> can you sort by weight?
[1:59:08] <TyrantBelial> Pat your outfit sucks go fashion souls correctly, don't standard set it bitch.
[1:59:09] <MadCrainProductions> Pat what's your favorite str weapon in this game
[1:59:13] <%Slaardacity> holy shit pat have you been up all night?
[1:59:17] <jmepik> my fav fashion was gundyr head, gael chest, random brown pants
[1:59:19] <BTRNDL> this is not a standard time for a fuckBoivin stream pvpS
[1:59:27] <jmepik> with the red and white shield
[1:59:28] <alrobot2014> @spleekle he woke up early
[1:59:28] <+VanaSkiller> HE WOKE UP SOME HOURS AGO
[1:59:37] <%foreverN2dust> ^
[1:59:37] <doctor_be> Heavy armor is nearly pointless due to the poise change in DS3 anyway
[1:59:38] <Inebriateddonut> Clap and point after that one
[1:59:38] <$RubberFistFight> @TyrantBelial he can't be an ABSOLUTELY CHONK without wearing Gundyr's set though
[1:59:39] <Holycow8498> I really need to actually take the time out to play Dark Souls 3 and beat it i'm only at the watchers of abyss guys right now
[1:59:41] <%Keeble24> @stigna1 not sure, but i think he's still considering it tho
[1:59:41] <mechagrover> do you ever drink monster?
[1:59:41] <teflonbilly777> CLOSE
[1:59:45] <BTRNDL> pvpRad
[1:59:47] <%NovaKnightmare> ALMOST fucked up
[1:59:49] <medril07> haha
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> pfffff
[1:59:54] <+Raidou24> Holy shit Pat is streaming this early!?
[1:59:55] <Gieron666> Pat seems unusually ... not angry today
[1:59:59] <$RubberFistFight> oooh, the "edge of the roof" gasp. I'm familiar with that one.
[2:00:11] <alyss988> bryandHydrate
[2:00:12] <$spleekle> Early Pat is friendly Pat
[2:00:14] <kazadog> @Holycow8498 you can do it man the best zone (imo) is not too far away
[2:00:14] <Holycow8498> Hail Hydrate
[2:00:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Gieron666 he either slept well or is in the beginning stages of a cerebral aneurysm.
[2:00:18] <doctor_be> Return of the charged R2, WITH A VENGENCE
[2:00:21] <medril07> I can't remember if I ever beat these guys
[2:00:21] <MadCrainProductions> these designs
[2:00:25] <teflonbilly777> @RubberFistFight You can really feel your ass pucker on that one
[2:00:28] <$RubberFistFight> O H B O I
[2:00:28] <zipfile777> who?
[2:00:30] <MadCrainProductions> I haven't seen these guys before, I like em though lol
[2:00:41] <+Townspoon> i refuse to believe this normal people hours - im going to submit a complaint to the union!
[2:00:42] <fragdar> yo pat, why so much red bull when the world offers you delicious delicious coffe
[2:00:43] <Gieron666> Pat is in his larval state ?
[2:00:45] <+megamonmon123> i wish dark souls took a mechanic from berserk where the more of a type of enemy you kill with a weapon the more effective it is at killing that enemy
[2:00:47] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat let me get some fashion shots of that outfit, i really like it
[2:00:48] <alyss988> I gasped when I found Solaire in DS 1 haha
[2:00:50] <grayjammer> NO!!! PANIC HARDER!!!!
[2:00:53] <Inebriateddonut> Coward tactics worked
[2:00:55] <$RubberFistFight> @MadCrainProductions believe me you wouldn't say that if you were playing. They fucking SUUUUUUUCK.
[2:00:56] <BTRNDL> estus and chill pvpKing
[2:00:57] <%Taco5553> recently got into warframe because of you, Pat. is it worth finishing every node in the star chart?
[2:01:00] <shozent> I had to do the math, and you guys would have about 2000 hours of LP
[2:01:10] <%Keeble24> to be fair, fuck those guys
[2:01:15] <medril07> surprisingly a lot of lore for the fat boi angels
[2:01:15] <teflonbilly777> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[2:01:18] <%foreverN2dust> @alyss988 but that's what he's from originally snowso1Wut
[2:01:22] <Inebriateddonut> THE DODGES
[2:01:24] <MadCrainProductions> lol oh no
[2:01:27] <katocrimson> do a running jump attack
[2:01:27] <doctor_be> @Taco5553 Youll need to finish every node on the chart to do the endgame content thingy
[2:01:29] <$RubberFistFight> THEY ARE THE MOST SERIOUS, PAT. LOOK AT THEIR ARMOR. IT IS SERIOUS ARMOR.
[2:01:30] <stigna1> @Taco5553 Not Pat, but I've been with Warframe since the very start. Don't sweat doing every node; instead generally work on progressing through the starchart.
[2:01:37] <kazadog> I wish the winged knights had a better lore payoff with the whole angel thing
[2:01:38] <+jestrfestr> a mission type that gives you alot of ENDO opens when you fo @Taco5553
[2:01:45] <Holycow8498> Why do the fat guys have wings now
[2:01:50] <stigna1> @Taco5553 that'll give you quests, unlocks and push you through a natural gear/story progression.
[2:01:50] <+jestrfestr> do*
[2:01:51] <MadCrainProductions> are they supposed to look like smough
[2:01:56] <Zebylth> @taco5553 yeah, you'll unlock a special type of mission
[2:01:57] <juicedmeats> i just backstab fish these guys
[2:01:57] <%Gogogolem> what the hell pat?
[2:02:01] <$RubberFistFight> @kazadog you mean the pilgrim butterflies in TRC?
[2:02:21] <MadCrainProductions> I have a switch and I haven't played bayonetta 2 yet what am i doing with my life
[2:02:24] <stigna1> @Taco5553 and by progress through the starchart I mean move from planet to planet, picking up what gear interests you on the way.
[2:02:27] <%KevinsLunchbox> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:02:28] <$RubberFistFight> titanite C H O N K
[2:02:29] <kazadog> @RubberFistFight kinda just wish we got more info about the whole situation
[2:02:30] <doctor_be> he already get the slab from that fight?
[2:02:33] <jonathandemel> Hey Pat what's your favourite drink, taste-wise?
[2:02:44] <alyss988> Lol I know
[2:02:44] <shozent> Retuuuurn the slab
[2:02:53] <JacktheSleeper42> Or suffer the curse
[2:02:57] <+blackkanye> I haven't either @MadCrainProductions . Then again I never finished Bayo 1 to the end. I also haven't finished any dmcs because I always get distracted by other games
[2:03:01] <$RubberFistFight> @kazadog I just wish they'd stop fucking screaming when you were trying to find the exit to the Earthen Peak area
[2:03:02] <%foreverN2dust> LUL
[2:03:09] <%Taco5553> @stigna1 thanks, that's what I've been doing. there are so many nodes.....
[2:03:10] <OldManDeckardCain> wtf is this, why did pat become an eu streamer? LUL
[2:03:10] <juicedmeats> lorian helm is good fashion imo
[2:03:19] <Mnightshyamallama> so why do some of the status meters show up when you fast travel? I have never figured out why that happens
[2:03:20] <shozent> Kinda look like Plague
[2:03:22] <+Raidou24> Zen Pat is very off-putting
[2:03:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> chonky boi
[2:03:23] <Inebriateddonut> KING
[2:03:25] <Jontman42> Look at this hero
[2:03:25] <MadCrainProductions> @blackkanye I love bayo 1 though so it's even more egregious for me
[2:03:27] <juicedmeats> not bad, pat
[2:03:28] <$RubberFistFight> [Crazy Talk] kicked in and changed the numbers
[2:03:32] <jonathandemel> Magnifique
[2:03:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you have a crown you can't see under now
[2:03:34] <fragdar> fuck, you look bad
[2:03:35] <teflonbilly777> I ordered the Design Works book for DS3 the other day. Already have the DS1 and 2 ones. There's some gorgeous art in those books
[2:03:39] <kazadog> @RubberFistFight haha theyre not very scary since from nerfed them and i play with the sound down so the screams arent that bad
[2:03:41] <%Keeble24> EUGH
[2:03:54] <MadCrainProductions> Pat we know your thoughts on get good but what about get bad?
[2:03:55] <Holycow8498> @AngriestPat Did you see the Monster Hunter World news?
[2:03:56] <+RushUnplugged> @Mnightshyamallama it happens if you have the Prisoner's Chain ring on, it lowers defenses
[2:03:56] <doctor_be> I ran a Moonlight greatsword mage build recently, it was surprisingly interesting
[2:04:01] <+blackkanye> I love bayo too. And dmc. Just back then I didn't stick with games period. LIke p4 for example @MadCrainProductions
[2:04:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[2:04:03] <el_phthalo> Pat, consider the great club and or the quakestone hammer.
[2:04:11] <stigna1> @Taco5553 Yeah, there can be an overwhelming amount of stuff. Warframe's a bit of a mess, in a loving way. If you're on PC, feel free to add me if you need tips on the fly. Its "stinga"
[2:04:16] <$RubberFistFight> dude Andre is the FOR REALEST motherfucker in that joint @AngriestPat
[2:04:20] <+katarjin> Ello yall
[2:04:21] <doctor_be> Magic isnt as good in DS3 as it was in 1 and 2, so you end up using your sword alot more
[2:04:28] <$RubberFistFight> he's been working on that sword for MILLIONS OF YEARS
[2:04:38] <Inebriateddonut> Does Andre still have his dropkick?
[2:04:42] <Mnightshyamallama> @RushUnplugged so it is the game equipping your shit as you load in
[2:04:44] <maledictus_faust> that's right, maximize your anime
[2:04:44] <medril07> I think I did a katana run with Fat Boi armour
[2:04:46] <MadCrainProductions> idk why people call magic easy mode, Magic in dark souls 1 is impossible for me
[2:04:46] <stigna1> ahh man, magic in DS2 was so great.
[2:04:49] <$RubberFistFight> or maybe just a week depending on how long between 1 and 3
[2:04:56] <juicedmeats> second r1 combos into 3rd in pvp which k ocms gs up a tier
[2:04:58] <medril07> with pyromancy too
[2:04:59] <Holycow8498> He never mean't to make Ms Jackson's cry @RubberFistFight
[2:05:00] <alyss988> @forevern2dust I thought he was later in the game for some reason so yeah
[2:05:02] <kazadog> @RushUnplugged i think its more because it increases your stats and therefore increasing your status defense and when status defence is increased it has to reduce it from the buildup bar by the amount the resistance was increased
[2:05:09] <juicedmeats> ugs are low tier in general tho
[2:05:15] <$RubberFistFight> @Holycow8498 he apologised a trillion times?
[2:05:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Wait, I looked away for 5 minutes and you already switched back to the Greatsword?
[2:05:18] <doctor_be> DS2 continues to be the best balanced dark souls combat wise. biggest viable build variety
[2:05:18] <Goldenwolf98> I really hope the MHW payed DLC adds enough stuff to make them game feel super new
[2:05:18] <jmepik> I love UGS anyway
[2:05:23] <kazadog> @RushUnplugged like when you chug a siegbrau
[2:05:25] <Goldenwolf98> the*
[2:05:26] <KaijuBBQ> Chilling with not-angry pat is surprisingly nice
[2:05:33] <MadCrainProductions> What's better in this game, the greatsword or the great club?
[2:05:39] <%KevinsLunchbox> who needs to actually play the video game. just brute force your penis into them
[2:05:49] <juicedmeats> great club in pvp
[2:05:56] <Inebriateddonut> @MadCrainProductions They're both pretty great
[2:06:00] <StryfeDragon> @MadCrainProductions Greatsword in terms of pure damage
[2:06:03] <doctor_be> Armor doesnt matter for shit, just wear the rags
[2:06:10] <CloudCircus> Hi Goofy
[2:06:13] <jmepik> yay
[2:06:14] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @KevinsLunchbox There's a joke in there somewhere, I can feel it.
[2:06:15] <$RubberFistFight> @KaijuBBQ Paige has had a calming influence on him.
[2:06:15] <%Taco5553> @stigna1 will do.
[2:06:18] <MadCrainProductions> ooh, I main the great club usually
[2:06:18] <jmepik> i was right
[2:06:28] <Holycow8498> Andre's sorry Miss Jackson he never mean't to make your daughter cry
[2:06:30] <MadCrainProductions> I'll try the greatsword next then
[2:06:44] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat are you using the double great sword?
[2:06:45] <%KevinsLunchbox> @MainMan_Jonadiah oh it's in there
[2:06:48] <StryfeDragon> If Pat could get 66 strength that weapon would be terrifyingly strong
[2:06:51] <kazadog> @MadCrainProductions depends honestly great club has more hyper armour, horizontal moveset but terrible wa while greatsword has better range damage and useful weapon art
[2:07:01] <MadCrainProductions> hmmm
[2:07:14] <el_phthalo> Pat the cathedral knight Gus does strike damage, great sword does standard.

[2:07:46] <+katarjin> @AngriestPat does your cat get pissy about seeing other cats?
[2:07:47] <maledictus_faust> I've never been a penny pincher with damage. usually only care about poise breaking and stamina consumption

[2:08:17] <jmepik> I used the regular Greatsword for the base game, and absolutely fucked every boss
[2:08:18] <SovPho> it's so early
[2:08:19] <ConLin_Plays> man this is such a weird boss
[2:08:24] <Username_Needed> you're too big rn

[2:08:57] <ConLin_Plays> This is pretty much the Arena Preview boss
[2:08:57] <josiro1437> i love how you drive the sword through the ground on the upswing
[2:08:57] <grayjammer> @durant_kdtrey Functionally? It's Vordt 2.0
[2:09:02] <medril07> why gravetender so aggressive? and why does he have big wooofie?
[2:09:04] <+GreatBrightBlack> I hate all the Sif clones
[2:09:05] <Mnightshyamallama> I like to think every wolf in this series that isn't sif is actually just named not-sif
[2:09:06] <teflonbilly777> Damn that sword does big damage
[2:09:11] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @KevinsLunchbox Any second now, I just need to tickle and tease this joke out.

[2:09:22] <juicedmeats> yeah that's decent
[2:09:24] <stigna1> @RubberFistFight Fun fact! In humans, toxo does not actually cause affection for cats, but rather more risky behaviour. For example, the percentage of bikers with it is in the high 90s.

[2:09:59] <SovPho> I should give Dark Souls 3 another playthrough, I didn't really like it the first time around.
[2:09:59] <$RubberFistFight> @stigna1 you're half-right. It does both, but it also increases the likelihood of depression.
[2:10:01] <MadCrainProductions> Pat did you expect that Tarkus clip from your dark souls let's play to get that big

[2:10:43] <doctor_be> it isnt oolacile at all.
[2:10:47] <$RubberFistFight> nah that tower is where Priscilla is in Ariamis, @AngriestPat
[2:10:48] <ConLin_Plays> It looked a bit like a tinier kiln
[2:10:52] <jamesofn> sell some garbage
[2:10:53] <TyrantBelial> Still not Ludwig Holy Greatsword damage though
[2:10:53] <doctor_be> Pat is wrong as usual

[2:11:09] <+BourbonneBlack> kitty
[2:11:23] <Gieron666> you have to fix that ALOTTA DAMAGE with FlexSeal
[2:11:28] <availablethor> I think this actually is the painted world of ariamis, just like, after a million years. It seems to be built on it. You can find Priscilla's arena at the bottom.
[2:11:28] <alrobot2014> there are windows in the sex dungeon?
[2:11:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> I'd stop mentioning the black kitty Pat. Droves of degenerates are going to swarm over Montreal looking for a black kitty sitting in the window
[2:11:32] <Bailey__gaming> I never finished ringed city i really must go back to it
[2:11:42] <$RubberFistFight> I wonder if they just tape the titanite pieces to the sword with flex tape
[2:11:42] <maledictus_faust> if you can't dance with a boss, just stomp on its foot.
[2:11:47] <durant_kdtrey> My first run of Dark Souls 3 I just used the basic longsword it was op as hell
[2:11:48] <doctor_be> use a bow, play hard mode
[2:11:48] <SovPho> @AngriestPat strength weapons are the fuckin best
[2:11:51] <stigna1> @Bailey__gaming Its quite good!
[2:11:52] <CassyASG> pat you madman streaming this early
[2:11:53] <MadCrainProductions> Dex is for cowards
[2:11:53] <axelcezar> you lack finesse
[2:11:53] <$RubberFistFight> like andre's just got a box of flex tape hidden under his anvil
[2:11:54] <SovPho> @AngriestPat Great Axe in dark souls 1 omg
[2:11:55] <fragdar> you ever did a luck build?
[2:11:55] <BTRNDL> I want the big damage!
[2:12:03] <%JJCheeker> i clapped when I saw Anor Londo prerecJay
[2:12:06] <juicedmeats> best strength weapon is exile
[2:12:10] <efratzy> its way more satisfying
[2:12:17] <+Mr_Arson> didn't you get massive shit for using the estoc in the ds3 lets play
[2:12:17] <+KawaiiJetty> Fun of strenght weapon is seeing the AR damage going big
[2:12:20] <MadCrainProductions> STR builds are big dick energy
[2:12:21] <%KevinsLunchbox> I clapped! I clapped when I saw it!
[2:12:21] <$RubberFistFight> @JJCheeker holy shit a jay bauman face
[2:12:26] <Bailey__gaming> @durant_kdtrey i played with the broadsword i found in the 1st area the whole game it had a op move set lol
[2:12:30] <ConLin_Plays> Lucky Ted run when?
[2:12:36] <%foreverN2dust> AR?

[2:13:17] <stigna1> Woah, deja vu.
[2:13:19] <kazadog> @AngriestPat quality builds got hella nerfed
[2:13:19] <+KawaiiJetty> @foreverN2dust oh it means attack rating
[2:13:24] <Inebriateddonut> I've done like 4 or 5 different playthroughs and I always unknowingly do quality
[2:13:26] <josiro1437> Pat uses STR because he likes the big and strong
[2:13:30] <Holycow8498> Where is the baby to hit

[2:13:54] <kazadog> @AngriestPat dark builds are the new hotness
[2:13:55] <MadCrainProductions> I think the star wars vids are my favorite

[2:13:56] <InsomniacPersona> PAT ITS 7 AM FUCK YOU
[2:13:56] <medril07> Thanks I'll look it up
[2:14:04] <+bubbli97> @kazadog how did they nerf quality builds?
[2:14:09] <Silent_Fyraena> Never done a quality build, they never seem to be worth it unless you're going super late game or into NG++...
[2:14:15] <StryfeDragon> Quality got nerfed while strength and dex were slightly buffed (especially sharp infusion)
[2:14:15] <jmepik> dark build is really good, but I don't know the spread
[2:14:16] <juicedmeats> not as hard as old hunters lol
[2:14:18] <Inebriateddonut> This is the part where they start talking about marrying into the screaming bird kingdom
[2:14:18] <Silent_Fyraena> I'm probably doing it wrong, I assume.
[2:14:21] <jmepik> I know dark greatsword is even better than heavy
[2:14:21] <%around_40_jobbers> but Pat, I say, I LIKE the old hunters!
[2:14:22] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat so, is an all luck build actually viable?
[2:14:23] <BTRNDL> if anything is good you know Miyazaki is gonna nerf it because he hates the players pvpRed
[2:14:26] <jmepik> but I memorized the heavy build
[2:14:27] <kazadog> @bubbli97 less scaling and added better scaling to everything else
[2:14:28] <el_phthalo> Dex builds should have never been buffed.
[2:14:29] <ConLin_Plays> What is a Quality Build?
[2:14:32] <jmepik> not the dark
[2:14:35] <%jiin6> STR go up?
[2:14:35] <+KawaiiJetty> Old Hunters easily kicked my butt
[2:14:36] <jamesofn> ConLin_Plays str+dex
[2:14:37] <vincerocmm> flex sward
[2:14:39] <doctor_be> Quality is STR+DEX
[2:14:40] <ConLin_Plays> ah!
[2:14:41] <juicedmeats> dex is fun because sharp scales all the way up to 90 dex
[2:14:41] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat just redid The Old Hunters on stream recently and yeah, it feels like that one section near Ludwig with the blood river and the fucking Cainhurst Ticks
[2:14:44] <Inebriateddonut> *knives and rapier
[2:14:45] <arfsm95> claw rapier
[2:14:50] <teflonbilly777> Youtube Rewind should've just been 15 minutes of Rich Evans going AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIDSSSSSSS
[2:14:51] <synthcutter> yo, what time is it over there?
[2:14:52] <%Taco5553> on a scale of 1 to 10, how disappointed were you with how the DS1 remake turned out? @angriestpat
[2:14:52] <BTRNDL> @ConLin_Plays a build with equal strengh and dex
[2:14:52] <Goldenwolf98> I love the claw rapier
[2:14:56] <Holycow8498> its surprising the amount of bloodborne enemies that found there way into Dark Souls 3
[2:14:57] <+paladinstarbuster> *poopbags
[2:14:58] <+overhaze> What was the name of the RLM video?
[2:14:58] <StryfeDragon> You don't like their Shit-Tail? OpieOP
[2:14:59] <jamesofn> ConLin_Plays its named that because the upgrade path that used it in Demons Souls was called Quality
[2:14:59] <ConLin_Plays> okay!
[2:15:02] <+bubbli97> KITTY
[2:15:04] <+RushUnplugged> quality is str/dex at 40/40, it used to be the best but then it got slightly nerfed
[2:15:04] <%around_40_jobbers> Pog

[2:18:42] <jmepik> @kazadog how much END would you recommend for Greatsword? 40? or just 35
[2:18:45] <+QuadraticGravity> god damn he is OLD LOOKING
[2:18:46] <Tucker0603> I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST!
[2:18:48] <jamesofn> @AngriestPat if there was going to be a dark souls rep in smash, would you prefer Solaire who would have a somewhat generic sword and board moveset with some miracles thrown in, or someone like Artorias who has a good variety of stuff to pull from despite being less iconic
[2:18:48] <majindusto> Beef got Tenderized
[2:18:50] <Goldenwolf98> I killed this guy super hard my first playthrough of this cause I didnt know he was an npc LUL
[2:18:51] <Amberizing> if you come back to this guy after you beat elfriede you get a slab
[2:18:51] <$RubberFistFight> how the fuck do you bury fire
[2:18:55] <Bailey__gaming> This NPC : "Smell ya later noob"
[2:19:00] <%BioApple> What's that, Ash? My grandson's name is EL BIFE COSMICOS?
[2:19:02] <ovan20> @AngriestPat did this npc get new dialog?
[2:19:05] <Jontman42> It's their intestines hanging out of their ass
[2:19:05] <+RushUnplugged> crap bag
[2:19:07] <Inebriateddonut> Aren't they assbags? cuz they come from the ass?
[2:19:09] <her0_89> oh shit! Pats finally live while i am able to watch fro once
[2:19:10] <kazadog> @AngriestPat you should consider a dryfinger period or a fight club when you get near the end so you can do some pvp with chat
[2:19:10] <BTRNDL> it's not dick bags, it's entrails pvpRed
[2:19:14] <%JJCheeker> "killll meee" bitterGobble
[2:19:18] <synthcutter> remember to go back to him after friede
[2:19:19] <$RubberFistFight> B I R D I E D I C K B A G S
[2:19:25] <RantingRavager> It's their pube-dreadlocks that are made sticky through their fecal matter
[2:19:27] <%foreverN2dust> I always thought it was frozen poop
[2:19:27] <%around_40_jobbers> I'm pretty sure that shield might have been one of the dumbest things they added to the base game
[2:19:32] <doctor_be> If it is going to be a from software rep in smash, I would imagine it would be from that new ninja game
[2:19:37] <majindusto> What Freaks
[2:19:37] <+QuadraticGravity> pat stop murdering townsfolk
[2:19:43] <Goldenwolf98> not really
[2:19:44] <Inebriateddonut> ehhhh...
[2:19:47] <BTRNDL> that cown is pretty stupid tho
[2:19:50] <Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat what time is it for you?
[2:19:50] <Xiangchang> Wait whaaa?! Pat's streaming in the morning? Long may the Stream shine! \[T]/
[2:19:51] <InsomniacPersona> it is the bloodborne hat
[2:19:54] <KaijuBBQ> gaping dragon for smash
[2:19:55] <+RushUnplugged> dem toe boots
[2:19:57] <longrat> god i hate this section
[2:19:58] <%SmolBluGhost> Hello am back with egg sandwiches apatElmo
[2:19:59] <%foreverN2dust> @Bailey__gaming EST
[2:20:00] <%SolitudeOtM> not even close to bloodborne
[2:20:08] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh, yeah. That can happen to chickens. They can come out of the eggs deformed with their guts hanging out of their butthole. @PlagueOfGripes could probably back me up on that one. Shit's gross and sad.
[2:20:09] <%iwasJase> why are you awaka right now Pat
[2:20:09] <BTRNDL> Tarkus for Smash Kreygasm
[2:20:14] <stigna1> Man, this town was so great to invade in as a caster.
[2:20:19] <Bailey__gaming> i dunno what the time is in EST as im in GMT lol i only know my time
[2:20:20] <ConLin_Plays> Tarkus assist Trophy
[2:20:21] <+JuriHansFeet> Patches for Smash
[2:20:22] <kazadog> I wish the invasion cooldwon wasnt so ludicrously long in DS3
[2:20:24] <Holycow8498> beasts all over the shop
[2:20:33] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Poo on a stick? Reminds me of Kids in the Hall.
[2:20:34] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight what the fuck I'm sad now
[2:20:36] <her0_89> Oh god...Pat said hi back to me. SENPAI NOTICED ME! What do I do with this power?
[2:20:51] <Goldenwolf98> If we do get a dark souls rep for smash it should be the best good boy Sif
[2:20:54] <jmepik> I guess for SL120, Dark Greatsword would be 32 STR, 33 FTH, 33 INT
[2:21:01] <ConLin_Plays> go and wonder why Pat is your senpai
[2:21:02] <jmepik> 745 total AR
[2:21:06] <majindusto> It reminds me of Djura from Bloodborne
[2:21:06] <alrobot2014> fight h naked in the rain @her0_89
[2:21:11] <Bailey__gaming> ah it's 8:40 AM thats like a normal time to be awake for normal people
[2:21:13] <+RushUnplugged> BUT WHAT IF YOU NEED THEM LATER
[2:21:14] <juicedmeats> 30 int faith gets you perfectly good scaling imo
[2:21:15] <%iwasJase> yeah no
[2:21:22] <synthcutter> BIG OCD
[2:21:23] <doctor_be> The goblins tell you to
[2:21:26] <%Aggro_Will> @AngriestPat You're crazy for a morning Dark Souls stream, but it's the good crazy that I can watch while I wait for IKEA.
[2:21:28] <%iwasJase> but what if you get something tho
[2:21:29] <%KevinsLunchbox> just parry themm
[2:21:31] <+QuadraticGravity> those guys weapon is so cool
[2:21:33] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut yeah. I got to see that when I was like 10, so it's kinda burned into my brain. What's super sad is that the other chicks and the mother reject it, and it stumbles around after them for a little while. Before... well.. yeah, the inevitable.
[2:21:34] <grayjammer> I agree
[2:21:40] <kazadog> @jmepik but then you have to sac a bunch of poise, hp or stamina with those stats
[2:21:40] <ConLin_Plays> oh yeah, watched the latest DmC and boy that kick
[2:21:42] <fragdar> use gael set..
[2:21:43] <alyss988> Oof
[2:21:44] <jmepik> it's like 1 point lower if you go 30 INT/FTH and pump the rest into str
[2:21:48] <Bailey__gaming> I love that you get the Wolverine Claws that those dudes have,
[2:21:51] <IronEncore> Kill them all pat
[2:21:52] <$RubberFistFight> it's super messed up and i'm kinda regretting bringing it up now.
[2:21:57] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Did you see that Epic Game Store is having some trouble with Privacy Policy? It appears it doesn't comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)...
[2:22:04] <jmepik> that'd be with less vit but 35 vig, 35 stam
[2:22:06] <$RubberFistFight> THANKS A BUNCH, MY STUPID BRAIN AND THE BIG MOUTH CONNECTED TO IT.
[2:22:08] <StryfeDragon> At this point there's nothing in any of the DLCs other than Soul items that are truly worth the trouble for your build unless there's other armorsets you want
[2:22:14] <$SereneFox> So is this the earliest pat has ever been awake?
[2:22:15] <jmepik> 40 END is probably comfier tbh
[2:22:22] <jmepik> you can still get skyhigh AR
[2:22:23] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Since Kids in the Hall was a Canadian sketch show I'm assuming more of Canada knows it than the rare few people I've met in America that do.
[2:22:28] <doctor_be> That bird was clearly hungover, you monster
[2:22:35] <+risenlp2> @AngriestPat no more dandruff stick?! PogChamp
[2:22:35] <jmepik> My fav fashion build only needs like 28 vit
[2:22:39] <medril07> Hey! A visitor has come to the Village! Let's welcome hjm!
[2:22:44] <jmepik> so I can keep vig at 35
[2:22:56] <Bailey__gaming> good job Sword
[2:22:59] <$RubberFistFight> @doctor_be yeah they're trying to recover after a huge weekend bender and then some fat chucklefuck with a giant sword comes tearing through their village.
[2:23:04] <%envy1499> More like ice try. Amiright?
[2:23:06] <Goldenwolf98> As much as we shit on DmC, and as much as it deserves that shit, it can safely say its not the worst DMC game that goes to DMC2 LUL
[2:23:10] <stigna1> Folks, you're missing the truely optimal scaling; 99 int for maximal magic.
[2:23:14] <%JJCheeker> the crown does remind me of Djura's hat a bit
[2:23:22] <zipfile777> PETA
[2:23:33] <doctor_be> WHIFF
[2:23:34] <SkinnersBox> :(
[2:23:35] <%KevinsLunchbox> git gud
[2:23:37] <jmepik> So 35 VIG, 40 END, 33 STR, 30 FTH, 30 INT
[2:23:38] <jamesofn> i think you have to do it from the roof dont you
[2:23:39] <ConLin_Plays> LUL
[2:23:40] <$RubberFistFight> hahahahaha
[2:23:41] <Bailey__gaming> lol
[2:23:42] <jmepik> i guess?
[2:23:44] <+QuadraticGravity> Int-only runs are fun
[2:23:44] <BTRNDL> nice baby jump pvpKing
[2:23:45] <StryfeDragon> With 99 Int your strongest spell might do as much damage as a dex build with 30 dex and a dagger PogChamp PogChamp
[2:23:45] <KaijuBBQ> lmao
[2:23:46] <jamesofn> or am i remembering wrong
[2:23:48] <+KawaiiJetty> Big give up
[2:23:50] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Did I just enter the Twilight Zone?! Why is he up and streaming?! ScaredyCat
[2:23:51] <stigna1> Pat has defeated the OCD! Nightmare Slain!
[2:23:51] <$RubberFistFight> GRATE JAEORB @AngriestPat
[2:23:55] <pshuuu> this is what playing STR weaposn does to a player. they put no effort into anything anymore
[2:23:55] <medril07> Lucatiel is the best
[2:24:06] <doctor_be> Going to work to play more video games
[2:24:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> That was a big Liam gun jump leap but Liam would've made it thanks to his youth
[2:24:15] <%foreverN2dust> Lucatiel is gross looking though
[2:24:16] <SkinnersBox> Recording more Star Trek PogChamp

[2:24:42] <SPidERMan8576> finally smash

[2:24:43] <%JJCheeker> Star Trek
[2:24:48] <doctor_be> Time to code a star trek fighting game
[2:24:50] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Boo
[2:24:51] <RantingRavager> KIRK VS SSJ KIRK
[2:24:53] <alyss988> Nice
[2:24:54] <Bailey__gaming> @Blackenedcrustcynicism Picking Worf means you have NO HONOUR
[2:24:54] <+Palidanjani> What time zone are you in?
[2:24:55] <grayjammer> Alright. I'm bushed. I need to go to sleep now. Have big fun in the Corvian Village; the best zone in this DLC
[2:24:59] <majindusto> SETTLE IT IN SMASH!
[2:24:59] <+Kirbachev> Star Trek fisticuffs is a hilarious idea though
[2:25:00] <doctor_be> YOU HAVE NO ho- dammit
[2:25:01] <InsomniacPersona> Pick the top tiers @AngriestPat K Rool and Pichu and Luigi
[2:25:05] <Silent_Fyraena> Is it true that the star trek game is the big poo-poo?
[2:25:07] <Goldenwolf98> So we gettin Playstation All Stars is what your saying? Kappa
[2:25:07] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> I want to see Data fight the Gorn.
[2:25:08] <+KawaiiJetty> Amiibo cockfighting when
[2:25:10] <$RubberFistFight> those birds are like "just give me some fucking tylenol" and you're like "HOW STRANGE THAT'S THE NAME OF MY SWORD"
[2:25:12] <StryfeDragon> Those things are a damn bitch to fight in NG+7
[2:25:12] <Shooterboy23> Ben Sisqo would be OP in a star trek fighting game
[2:25:14] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Would Q be the final boss?
[2:25:15] <%LocoCrazy_> Do Ridley some good for me huh?
[2:25:20] <doctor_be> The funny thing is the star trek game uses the same engine as Warframe
[2:25:21] <%invisi_bliss> bois with poise
[2:25:22] <ConLin_Plays> Is the Fall of Virgin DLC one of the worst DLCs ever?
[2:25:23] <SPidERMan8576> i hope it isnt upskirt fighter pt 2
[2:25:26] <+Kirbachev> @Shooterboy23 Given that he's basically fucking Jesus, yeah
[2:25:33] <stigna1> @Goldenwolf98 Am I crazy, or did that game have some real merit to it? I enjoyed it but I was a wee lad at the time.
[2:25:34] <PunishedRaccoon> !uptime
[2:25:34] <doctor_be> in fact, the big view bug was present in warframe with operators for awhile
[2:25:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 25m 36s.
[2:25:35] <%TheStarvingGood> uhh morning?
[2:25:37] <Silent_Fyraena> Been too busy watching stream vods to watch the LP yet
[2:25:46] <Tucker0603> @paladinstarbuster man of rad name, he's in the same one as me, east coast time zone
[2:25:53] <PunishedRaccoon> morning pat
[2:25:54] <Goldenwolf98> @stigna1 it was because you were a wee lad LUL
[2:25:58] <Inebriateddonut> OH NO A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED PLATFORM
[2:25:59] <juicedmeats> yeah but no pvp :(
[2:26:00] <Bailey__gaming> i predict a SMASHING good time on Fisticuffs this week!
[2:26:01] <caja_de_ojos> @AngriestPat make sure to tell matt that the zoom bug is in warframe
[2:26:01] <ovan20> you say that, until the first invisible wall LUL
[2:26:01] <grayjammer> BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE TO JUMP OVER
[2:26:02] <ConLin_Plays> Sekiro looks fun
[2:26:02] <%jiin6> Yea yea pat Star trek fighting game with your favorite captain janeway Kappa
[2:26:02] <%MaximumDaximum> thatll be great
[2:26:06] <Jontman42> I wanna play Sekiro so bad
[2:26:07] <doctor_be> Get 1,000,000 souls or kill 4 gods to bypass this rock
[2:26:07] <%JJCheeker> Worf vs Worf who would win?
[2:26:10] <%foreverN2dust> I'm interested to see what Fromsoft will do with vertical level design and transversal
[2:26:12] <InsomniacPersona> go up the buildings
[2:26:14] <uberhox> it's been a while since we heard something from fromsoft about it
[2:26:16] <Goldenwolf98> @stigna1 it is not a good game let alone a good smash clone LUL
[2:26:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> @AngriestPat When is Woolie going to coach you through the Darkest Dungeon?
[2:26:17] <%FrostMass22> Pat is STILL going?
[2:26:23] <ConLin_Plays> only about 3 months until Sekiro!
[2:26:24] <+KawaiiJetty> I really want to try Sekiro aaagh
[2:26:26] <medril07> WORF VS. BARREL WHO WOULD WIN?
[2:26:27] <%SergeEXE> Worf's spiune would lose
[2:26:30] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I dunno, my money's on Worf
[2:26:30] <%LocoCrazy_> Pat are you going to try that Ashen game?
[2:26:30] <%blinkinthedark> Morning Pat
[2:26:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Worf vs Shadow Data
[2:26:36] <RantingRavager> is worf a bad father, or is alexander just a shitty son?
[2:26:37] <ovan20> @medril07 barrel, of course!
[2:26:37] <ConLin_Plays> and KH3 next month!!!
[2:26:38] <$RubberFistFight> THIS BARREL HAS NO HONOUR OH NO MY SPINE
[2:26:38] <+Kavtech> I'm not sure who would win, but Worf would lose.
[2:26:40] <InsomniacPersona> Janeway is bottom of tierlist right?
[2:26:40] <doctor_be> which spine? there are 4 involved
[2:26:44] <BTRNDL> BlessRNG
[2:26:46] <TyrantBelial> Wrong, they're both job to someone who comes from nowhere.
[2:26:46] <+spook_knightatx> lirikPOG lirikPOG
[2:26:46] <+QuadraticGravity> The latter
[2:26:47] <kazadog> ugh wish i had more rum
[2:26:49] <%jiin6> Thats fine invisible walls got ya back
[2:26:49] <%foreverN2dust> bless you BlessRNG
[2:26:52] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Is Tuvix the Gotenks of this Star Trek fighting game?
[2:26:53] <+Kirbachev> @jiin6 Janeway's entire moveset would involve calling down orbital strikes from Voyager loaded with biological agents.
[2:26:55] <+terry_quest> gesundheit
[2:26:58] <Tucker0603> !uptime
[2:26:58] <Bailey__gaming> Wouldnt Data just wreck everyone in a fight? presuming no wepons allowed?
[2:26:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 27m .
[2:27:02] <Spiderfacev> thanks jesus
[2:27:08] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> That may be too obscure a reference, Tuvix lol
[2:27:10] <majindusto> BREAKFAST STREAM
[2:27:13] <doctor_be> Pretzel motion to commit warcrime
[2:27:13] <$RubberFistFight> lol Lore lays the beatdown on him, it's great
[2:27:17] <jamesofn> Bailey__gaming basically, yeah. hes busted op
[2:27:20] <+Kirbachev> @Bailey__gaming 7 of 9 might give him a fight. Might.
[2:27:23] <+Palidanjani> Warf vs El Papa Grande
[2:27:23] <ConLin_Plays> The Star Trek lp actually makes me want to watch the original show, too bad it isn't on Netflix over here
[2:27:27] <%FrostMass22> @blackenedcrustcynicism Captain Janeway is a murderer because of that episode
[2:27:41] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> @FrostMass22 only that episode, you've seen the show lol
[2:27:48] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> She is so bad lol
[2:27:50] <+QuadraticGravity> i have never watched star trek what did janeway do
[2:27:57] <%JJCheeker> Jordy vs stairs
[2:27:57] <majindusto> Janeway Best Captain!
[2:27:58] <InsomniacPersona> too bad Paige cant get hit in the the back all day. badumtss
[2:28:01] <+Kirbachev> @QuadraticGravity Crimes. Lots and lots of crimes.
[2:28:04] <KaijuBBQ> woolie would pick the boss character SSGSS SHIN SPOCK
[2:28:04] <$RubberFistFight> @Kirbachev jesus isn't that from the episode where it's a historical reconstruction from a bunch of aliens, and their version of Voyager is just like a giant fucking gun, encrusted with smaller guns?
[2:28:10] <medril07> Poor Worf. In most stories he has to be nerfed otherwise he would solve most of the problems
[2:28:11] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Quick, respec into the talons!
[2:28:13] <+QuadraticGravity> Generic??
[2:28:14] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> TUVIX for Smash!
[2:28:16] <%jiin6> The Original animated Star Trek is so goofy
[2:28:21] <%around_40_jobbers> My favorite part about Janeway is that she never did anything wrong
[2:28:40] <+Kirbachev> @RubberFistFight The one where they thought the Doctor was an android, and then they find his portable emitter?
[2:28:41] <Bailey__gaming> I always felt that someone on the Enterprise might have seen some movies ever so be worried about AI going rouge so would have whipped up some small anti data emp or some shit
[2:28:48] <Goldenwolf98> BIG OOOOFS
[2:28:48] <Inebriateddonut> Infuse talons with heavy gem
[2:28:49] <+QuadraticGravity> Pat that's one of the hypest weapons don't sandbag crow talons >:c
[2:28:50] <$RubberFistFight> @around_40_jobbers my favourite part about her is the undiagnosed psychotic disorder
[2:28:51] <medril07> Captain Fuckit best Captain
[2:28:52] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Would Tuvix fight like Noob/Smoke?
[2:28:54] <+neroame> Pat you coming back to 14 with the new update?
[2:28:56] <$RubberFistFight> @Kirbachev that's the one lol.
[2:28:59] <nepwar> holy shit pats awake right now
[2:28:59] <InsomniacPersona> Is there a tierlist of all Sar trek races?
[2:29:02] <kazadog> Im curious how many people in chat are trying to invade pat
[2:29:02] <majindusto> ITS TRUE
[2:29:05] <ConLin_Plays> Anyone watched Minecraft on Netflix? Kappa
[2:29:06] <+RushUnplugged> 7-of-9's tits though
[2:29:08] <%jiin6> Janeway got scott free from all the war crimes she did
[2:29:10] <+overhaze> JUSTICE FOR TUVIX!
[2:29:13] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Voyager has easily one of the worst "FUCK IT, let's just end the show NOW!" with Future Janeway and the borg tech getting them home out of nowhere lol.
[2:29:15] <alyss988> @jiin6 it’s the best
[2:29:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> @around_40_jobbers At least we all know now that you are a morally bankrupt person.
[2:29:26] <$RubberFistFight> @kazadog aren't we all guilty of trying to invade his heart? <3
[2:29:29] <medril07> The Prime Directive: Kill everything out there
[2:29:39] <doctor_be> be happy you arent playing WoW, they screwed the pooch with the new expansion
[2:29:41] <tensecondtarvis> I keep hearing about Janeway, but I am just finishing up TNG for the first time. What would be next? DS9 or Voyager?
[2:29:44] <+Kirbachev> @RubberFistFight I loved how on-the-nose that episode was. Like "yeah, it might as well be this" LUL
[2:29:45] <Goldenwolf98> There arent enough space hats in FF14 Kappa
[2:29:48] <ChillTonic> @AngriestPat Because of you, Paige and Eli, I'm re-watching DS9 and BOY OH BOY is Sisko weird. Like, manic weird at times, it's honestly unsettling.
[2:29:51] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat but you got me into FFXIV
[2:29:56] <medril07> Voyager
[2:30:02] <+GreatBrightBlack> Janeway wasn't a pussy like Picard
[2:30:03] <+QuadraticGravity> Pat also got me into ff14
[2:30:05] <%jiin6> DS9 is good
[2:30:06] <MadOx__> MMOs are weird. I bounce between them because i dont really do endgame, generally play all current content then fall off because not much to really do
[2:30:07] <zepelinnn> REEEEE
[2:30:10] <her0_89> >Pat enjoys swinging around long thick rod. More at 11.
[2:30:15] <+SirBearic> stormblood has a problem with overusing its references of past games, like more then half the expansion is nostalgia bait
[2:30:17] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat so elmo now has a black friend cat? it's like you and woolie Kappa
[2:30:19] <+alphonseisbest> @tensecondtarvis DS9 timeline wise
[2:30:21] <%FrostMass22> @chilltonic Apparently the actor did actually go insane so that's appropriate
[2:30:22] <Goldenwolf98> SLAVE KNIGHT
[2:30:24] <+Kirbachev> @tensecondtarvis DS9. It's fucking BORING at first, but the Dominion War really turns it around. Very good stuff.
[2:30:26] <katocrimson> slave clothes
[2:30:30] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> pat do you have the black knight ugs?
[2:30:31] <$RubberFistFight> @ChillTonic lol yeah sometimes he's jiggling and rubbing his hands like he's jonesing for a hit of space crack or something, it's great
[2:30:32] <alyss988> KonCha bye
[2:30:35] <Bailey__gaming> Doesnt Janeway outrank Picard to doing big war crimes, and getting Voyager home
[2:30:36] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> @tensecondtarvis DS9 came out first. If you HAVE to watch Voyager... the first two seasons are ehhh it soon gets worse and worse as the show goes on. Hell it never started out too hot either.
[2:30:37] <doctor_be> In the Pale Moonlight is the best episode of star trek ever
[2:30:39] <Shooterboy23> DS9 starts off boring with great writing
[2:30:39] <medril07> I liked Voyager more the DS9
[2:30:41] <juicedmeats> gael's has really good defense
[2:30:44] <tensecondtarvis> I KEEP HEARING OF THIS jANEWAY THO. iS SHE THAT BAD?
[2:30:44] <majindusto> FUCK THE PRIME DIRECTIVE, SHOOT FIRE ALL WEAPONS!
[2:30:44] <ChillTonic> @FrostMass22 Exsqueese me?
[2:30:52] <tensecondtarvis> wow caps, sry
[2:30:52] <juicedmeats> lore checks out since it's just a uniform
[2:30:52] <%BioApple> Man I just got Smash and Hadesand I got finals coming up and my friend just lowkey drops a "HEY I'M PLAYING FFXIV NOW YOU IN???" on me
[2:30:56] <%around_40_jobbers> Slaves of their own ambition OBVIOUSLY
[2:30:59] <%FrostMass22> DS9 starts as TNG lite but quickly turn into its own thing
[2:31:03] <doctor_be> it doesnt matter pat, it is the fact they are slaves
[2:31:04] <%JJCheeker> I've been watching Babylon 5 and dear lord the CGI is baaaaaad
[2:31:05] <Nehson> Hey try aiming yuunFAST
[2:31:05] <+Kirbachev> @doctor_be It's a FAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
[2:31:08] <ColRedyx> @SirBearic That's pretty much the theme of the main raid, but yeah, they kind of did it with the entire expansion. At least they're only referencing the good ones.
[2:31:10] <%LocoCrazy_> They were slaves to society, maaaan
[2:31:10] <stigna1> Slav knights, ez.
[2:31:10] <%foreverN2dust> @around_40_jobbers beat me to it
[2:31:12] <doctor_be> Gael probably had numerous masters
[2:31:13] <medril07> LAUNCH TORPEDOS
[2:31:14] <%FackinCrazy> slaves of the pontiff
[2:31:14] <%superc37> just generic kings and queens
[2:31:18] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat they where slaves to the sisters, one even still works for her, called gael
[2:31:18] <%around_40_jobbers> @foreverN2dust apatDab
[2:31:21] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Slaves of Fate
[2:31:25] <+QuadraticGravity> @BioApple yeah but it's real good tho
[2:31:29] <+RushUnplugged> up the ladder
[2:31:30] <%jiin6> Babylon 5 did not age well
[2:31:31] <$RubberFistFight> @tensecondtarvis her writing is horrifically inconsistent, to the point where the actress is on-record as saying "I thought she had an undiagnosed psychotic disorder so that's how I played her"
[2:31:35] <doctor_be> you can actually jump it
[2:31:35] <jamesofn> they were probably just slaves of whoever their master was, like how gael is a slave of the painting girl (or ariamis, i suppose)
[2:31:36] <%SolitudeOtM> Slaves to the Furtive Pigmys
[2:31:40] <%LocoCrazy_> fuckin sheeple
[2:31:46] <%FrostMass22> @chilltonic Avery Brooks is his name. Just search somethin like 'The captains documentary Sisko'
[2:31:46] <%KevinsLunchbox> gottem
[2:31:47] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> @FrostMass22 kind of like how TNG first started out as OG series part 2 then became it's own thing.
[2:31:52] <Jontman42> Slaves in the war against the dragons
[2:31:54] <doctor_be> HE WAS NAPPING YOU MONSTER
[2:31:55] <ConLin_Plays> a Precious coin
[2:31:56] <Bailey__gaming> Star Trek has many OSW style "boy" characters where you like them even tho they are garbage in some way
[2:31:58] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat they where slaves to the sisters, one even still works for her, called gael
[2:32:00] <Shaotanzhiten> It's early o'clock
[2:32:04] <tensecondtarvis> Oh damn, sounds like a fun show RubberFist
[2:32:08] <%JJCheeker> @jiin6 indeed
[2:32:10] <Goldenwolf98> Yo to anyone who has played Ashen that movement system is gonna make for some bad ass speedruns right?
[2:32:14] <her0_89> My favorite part about this stream is when pat almost fucks up.
[2:32:19] <juicedmeats> stupid church with the useless miracle
[2:32:23] <ConLin_Plays> don't stress it!
[2:32:24] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> As screwed as it is, Gene Roddenberry's death was probably the best thing for TNG. :P
[2:32:25] <voyagerwitch> what armor is this?
[2:32:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> go to work? You're working right now
[2:32:30] <synthcutter> have you been up all night?
[2:32:33] <Inebriateddonut> HEAD UP ASS
[2:32:35] <Username_Needed> Jebaited
[2:32:40] <arfsm95> you fell for the trap AGAIN
[2:32:41] <ConLin_Plays> WutFace
[2:32:42] <%superc37> @arfsm95 rly? like friede and the like? funny, cuz last i checked he worked for the painter
[2:32:44] <SunsetLaw> you call that work you lazy fatass?!
[2:32:45] <stigna1> @synthcutter Neh, the gang is just up early.
[2:32:50] <shin69c> Jebaited
[2:32:50] <SunsetLaw> btw jk love you
[2:32:52] <CloudCircus> You have a job?
[2:32:54] <synthcutter> ah i see
[2:32:54] <nepwar> man those crows look a lot less hotter than the ones from ds1
[2:32:56] <ChillTonic> @FrostMass22 I'm literally reading about it now, he's coocoo for coco puffs, huh?!
[2:33:01] <doctor_be> Roddenberry actually didnt want there to be any focus on interpersonal problems among the crew in TNG, as there was supposed to be no interpersonal problems in his future
[2:33:02] <Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat now i need to know who's in Pat's Boy Stable Wrestlerman related
[2:33:05] <%LocoCrazy_> Bird has sword hands, uses beak to peck. Sure bud.
[2:33:06] <+neroame> Man this makes me wanna play Souls
[2:33:07] <$RubberFistFight> @CloudCircus he means "going and playing video games with his friends"
[2:33:10] <arfsm95> @superc37 the painter IS one of the sister
[2:33:12] <jmepik> pat, when are you gonna hunt lunastra btw
[2:33:14] <+neroame> I should bring my PC to work
[2:33:16] <%SmolBluGhost> I've been up all damn night...and im not gonna stop now...at least for another hour and a half apatDab
[2:33:19] <SovPho> woolie's apartment isn't an office
[2:33:19] <doctor_be> Playing video games is not a job
[2:33:25] <tensecondtarvis> I guess I need to do the TNG movies as well before or after moving into DS9 or VOYAGER
[2:33:26] <%BioApple> what the heck is a best friends apatLiz
[2:33:29] <%FrostMass22> @chilltonic I don't know a lot about it, but he did seem off in the clip I saw
[2:33:30] <%SergeEXE> @arfsm95 is that canon
[2:33:33] <nepwar> whos job is it to clean the dust of the PC
[2:33:34] <%foreverN2dust> why not stay with us a little longer and just be super okay friends
[2:33:34] <majindusto> Job? What?
[2:33:43] <%superc37> @arfsm95 ... you mean one of the sisters of the sable church?... How?
[2:33:43] <+KawaiiJetty> Super PJs Friends
[2:33:44] <Inebriateddonut> Woolie started up ANOTHER podcast to compete with HIS OWN podcast
[2:33:44] <Shooterboy23> ironically pat is the smartest out the 3 and does the least work LUL
[2:33:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Oh man, the editing on Matt's Inferno. Perfection!
[2:33:46] <Goldenwolf98> Woolie just does shitposts about Naruto lets be honest kappa
[2:33:46] <%FrostMass22> @chilltonic It's really unfortunate because he is an amazing actor.
[2:33:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Take a small nap before leaving pat. It’ll help with your focus.
[2:33:49] <%SolitudeOtM> brain THOTS
[2:33:51] <%around_40_jobbers> apatCrazyhead Time for his true calling to appear
[2:33:51] <Goldenwolf98> Kappa *
[2:33:52] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat he's doing dante's inferno now, i'm so exited
[2:33:52] <SovPho> @AngriestPat tbh twitch streaming has a higher likeliness of hitting it big right now, doesn't it?
[2:33:53] <synthcutter> seems legit
[2:33:55] <doctor_be> Monetized shitposting
[2:33:58] <+PurpleDeluxe> !uptime
[2:33:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 34m .
[2:33:59] <Animeshowfan> your project is drinking redbull till you die
[2:33:59] <Fluxraw> wait, u wake up and THEN put on your pyjamas @AngriestPat ?
[2:34:00] <bilzin> why would you put on your pajamas AFTER waking up
[2:34:05] <Jamiebb846> How longs this ben up
[2:34:07] <%thebetterbard> @tensecondtarvis the Movies don't really line up
[2:34:12] <her0_89> Well Pat Im glad you are streaming so early. Now I can watch you in work before anyone else gets in.
[2:34:12] <+PurpleDeluxe> why is pat up so early?
[2:34:12] <CloudCircus> What does Paige do?
[2:34:13] <ConLin_Plays> Put some Mustard on a plate so she has some breakfast!
[2:34:20] <doctor_be> FUUUUUUUCK this room
[2:34:20] <jmepik> you guys dont sleep in the nude?
[2:34:22] <stigna1> Ok, but EVERYONE thinks that everyone around them is cooler than they are. Its not like streaming is a garbage thing or anything; entertainment is a noble goal.
[2:34:25] <synthcutter> yup two of those bastards
[2:34:26] <+RushUnplugged> Pat sleeps naked like a real man and puts on pajamas because SOCIETY, MAAAN
[2:34:27] <doctor_be> it took me forever and I was cheesing it with magic
[2:34:29] <BTRNDL> the angry birdos pvpS
[2:34:34] <nepwar> ah yes the infamous fuck-place
[2:34:40] <%JJCheeker> I could never get past this I stopped playing the DLC

[2:34:53] <Inebriateddonut> That went well :)
[2:34:53] <Bailey__gaming> If paige has to eat her hat due to bad sonic movie predictions will it be the get smoked hat?
[2:34:53] <%SergeEXE> f
[2:34:53] <+GreatBrightBlack> welcome to the fuck place
[2:34:54] <Goldenwolf98> Magic Pixel WASTED
[2:34:58] <+RushUnplugged> this place is SUPER not worth it
[2:34:58] <$RubberFistFight> DAMNIT PAT
[2:34:59] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat as cool as this dlc is I feel like its the worst dlc in the series
[2:35:02] <%KevinsLunchbox> Just parry it
[2:35:04] <stigna1> @JJCheeker I don't think you actually need to do the murder church if you don't wanna.
[2:35:05] <her0_89> Real tallk you all died there. Dont lie.
[2:35:07] <tensecondtarvis> @thebetterbard OK, so as I see fit to watch movies. ty
[2:35:08] <%JJCheeker> God I hate that room so much
[2:35:08] <doctor_be> On the bright side you have a bunch of new holes to use
[2:35:11] <TEALyOS> i havent dared go in there in a while
[2:35:11] <%SmolBluGhost> apatSmug Fuck that place man
[2:35:14] <+KawaiiJetty> I just yoink the item nd open the shortcut
[2:35:21] <katocrimson> i remember i coward cheesed one with arrows before fighting the other one
[2:35:23] <SovPho> oof
[2:35:24] <%foreverN2dust> any way to cheese them?
[2:35:25] <%LocoCrazy_> Crows hanging out waiting around like heeeyyyyy it's need a duude
[2:35:25] <majindusto> Shoulda Rolled
[2:35:31] <doctor_be> you can use a bow
[2:35:34] <Bailey__gaming> i bombed the fuck out of them i think
[2:35:34] <$RubberFistFight> @FackinCrazy it absolutely fucking is the worst goddamn DLC in the entire series. Ariandel's voice acting ALMOST makes up for it though
[2:35:35] <+morow1ec> Final boss of this dlc makes it worth it for me it's so good
[2:35:36] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Paige would have cleared it first try...
[2:35:36] <ConLin_Plays> Could Gael be considered the final final boss of the Dark Souls series?
[2:35:44] <synthcutter> just lure one of them outside
[2:35:52] <Inebriateddonut> @ConLin_Plays At this point yeah
[2:35:56] <stigna1> @ConLin_Plays Yeee. Him or Midir, depending on your definition.
[2:35:59] <%superc37> its called a Bow and- oh yeah that works too
[2:36:00] <StryfeDragon> I would consider Gael the final true boss, yes
[2:36:18] <doctor_be> dark souls probably isnt over, Sakurai walked it back
[2:36:19] <$RubberFistFight> @ConLin_Plays considering you fight him at the very end of everything, at the close of the world and the winding down of time itself, yeah he basically is the final boss of it all.
[2:36:25] <doctor_be> err myazaki
[2:36:26] <fireking900> I forgot about the ninjas
[2:36:36] <ConLin_Plays> kinda strange choice, just a dude that you meet at the start of a DLC
[2:36:36] <%superc37> walked it back how?
[2:36:45] <+Bouerd> Counter attacks with piercing weapons hurt
[2:36:45] <+KawaiiJetty> It's a stupid Bloodborne enemy
[2:36:50] <ConLin_Plays> but hey, he's Guts!
[2:36:56] <doctor_be> said there might be future games in the series. was vague about it
[2:36:57] <Shooterboy23> @ConLin_Plays hes a nobody just like you. its perfect.
[2:36:58] <+panickedcanadian> Morning Pat,how's the session going?
[2:37:00] <+morow1ec> Those guys move like main guy from sekiro
[2:37:05] <+RushUnplugged> considering he's been eating dark souls, in a sense YOU are GAEL's final boss
[2:37:07] <Bailey__gaming> Good Job Sword!t
[2:37:12] <$RubberFistFight> it's also worth noting that Gael's arena is proof of the fact that no matter what ending you pick the world is fucked, because it takes place at a point far in the future than you "endgame choice" after SoC.
[2:37:13] <%superc37> cuz i distinctly remember him saying in an interview that the dark souls series is done.
[2:37:19] <stigna1> @ConLin_Plays I sorta like that; everything important or meanginful has crumbled to ash and all that's left is some crappy Ashen one and a slave knight trying to make a painting.
[2:37:23] <%JJCheeker> Those bird creatures really freaked me out
[2:37:28] <%FackinCrazy> @RubberFistFight I like the final boss but man as a area its really rough and the champion feels like they ran out of time and had to just get another boss in there
[2:37:28] <synthcutter> is the greatsword any good? i see it has the fume moveset.
[2:37:33] <nepwar> i always thought it would be cool if you could get bosses' or certain enemies moveset if you get their weapons
[2:37:40] <Shooterboy23> if it were anymore up her alley it'd be your dick HEY OOO
[2:37:41] <axelcezar> i think it is garbage in DS2
[2:37:41] <sirjonston> of course paige wants that chunk
[2:37:45] <+KawaiiJetty> Wow you did a double hit on that fall
[2:37:45] <alrobot2014> @angriestpat why is that when i google janeway did nothing wrong, YOU are one of the first results
[2:37:47] <availablethor> She'll need the Fume Knight Greatsword
[2:37:55] <nepwar> Paige requires the super chuck
[2:37:56] <StryfeDragon> Alot of UGS have that Fume-esque moveset, though this one has a unique R2
[2:37:57] <+SleepyHero34> It’s rustic
[2:38:02] <doctor_be> Woolie LP 2, Ginger edition
[2:38:06] <stigna1> @nepwar Dark souls sorta delivers on that several times with boss weapons, if you're wondering.
[2:38:08] <Amberizing> you should get a crossbow and be Guts
[2:38:09] <%around_40_jobbers> chonk +
[2:38:20] <SovPho> are those a bloodborne
[2:38:21] <%Aggro_Will> Those Woolie calls are horrifying.
[2:38:21] <%JJCheeker> bitterGobble
[2:38:27] <Bailey__gaming> I loved the double Scythe you get from the Nun
[2:38:34] <Jontman42> Gael is a weirdo nobody that just wants the entire dark soul, fits he's the final boss against a weirdo nobody who wants all the souls for some reason.
[2:38:38] <%around_40_jobbers> ye
[2:38:41] <$RubberFistFight> "the underground with the goo" AKA "jesus fucking christ fly maggots make it stop THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER OF ALL TIME"
[2:38:42] <synthcutter> friede time soon?
[2:38:43] <Inebriateddonut> Very enjoy big funning
[2:38:45] <%SmolBluGhost> yerpp
[2:38:45] <Vroom0> yeah VoHiYo
[2:38:51] <Animeshowfan> ye its a really nice stream!
[2:38:51] <doctor_be> Edgelord shadow greatsword from this DLC is actually great for an int build swordsman
[2:38:54] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you think bloodborne 2 will actually happen?
[2:38:56] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> sbfpScared those birds
[2:38:56] <%TheGreatBamBe> The funnel everywhere system
[2:38:57] <doctor_be> plus the boss of the DLC is weak to shadow
[2:38:59] <$RubberFistFight> @synthcutter nah he still has to make it through the fly room
[2:39:00] <Tyrrosh> vordt´s hammer looking nice and pointy
[2:39:03] <%TysonPG> Im mining in warframe and i hate it but i want gara so im enjoying nothing
[2:39:05] <Inebriateddonut> Wait...it does?
[2:39:09] <enoughmold> Joy yes
[2:39:14] <Amberizing> think about it
[2:39:15] <ConLin_Plays> a Bloodborne in more steampunk style
[2:39:15] <%LocoCrazy_> Crippling existential dread doesn't let me have fun.
[2:39:16] <Jontman42> How does that sound disgusting
[2:39:19] <SovPho> *wearing only shoes* hey baby, want to have some big funning?
[2:39:19] <+duneblythe> I just got home from work
[2:39:20] <%superc37> yeah tbh while gael as a concept is cool that fact that hes THE final boss and a huge nobody is kind of not
[2:39:20] <Bailey__gaming> Fuck the sewer with the flys tho
[2:39:22] <%blinkinthedark> lots joy
[2:39:24] <Jontman42> I'm thinking about it and I don't see it
[2:39:26] <synthcutter> @RubberFistFight yeah but that shouldn't take that long
[2:39:27] <availablethor> Yeah, most Dark Souls ending. Two nobodies duking it out in the middle of nowhere for practically nothing.
[2:39:32] <nepwar> @stigna1 usually would be 2 moves. i was thinking more like that ds1 mod where you could play as the boss with all their moves
[2:39:37] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you think bloodborne 2 will actually happen?
[2:39:42] <stigna1> @TysonPG You can get the Sunpoint Plasma Drill at Fortuna and its just better than all the PoE drills, if that helps.
[2:39:42] <xanerts> I just have this in the background while i do World of light
[2:39:44] <doctor_be> He is a mirror of the player character @availablethor has it right
[2:39:44] <$RubberFistFight> @synthcutter unless the dice roll against him and he gets grablocked by a bunch of em
[2:39:44] <%around_40_jobbers> is THIS Anor Londo?
[2:39:47] <%foreverN2dust> What do you think of Vaati's prediction of the next souls game being in a Mesoamerica/Aztec inspired setting?
[2:39:52] <+Kirbachev> @Jontman42 They're kind of driven by the need for a purpose so they don't go totally hollow and lose their minds, I guess. Grabbing everything you can seems like a good, never-ending aim that can benefit you. Worked for Patches.
[2:39:52] <durant_kdtrey> damn
[2:39:53] <stigna1> @nepwar Super fair.
[2:39:54] <%Aggro_Will> Maybe it's all the white stuff everywhere, but... what if From Software made a Bloodbourne sequel called Cumbourne?
[2:39:55] <synthcutter> LUL true
[2:39:59] <durant_kdtrey> Never thought of it like that
[2:40:02] <doctor_be> EDGELORD
[2:40:06] <synthcutter> oh stfu vilheim
[2:40:09] <%TysonPG> @stigna1 oo ill go try that ty
[2:40:11] <arfsm95> nothing? it's the fucking dark soul
[2:40:12] <Shooterboy23> that sounds like you described a WWE maatch
[2:40:17] <Bailey__gaming> i killed this fucker before he finished his speach
[2:40:18] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat I just wish patches had been the one at the end not Gael
[2:40:21] <dukenux> Why is he streaming at cet afternoon?
[2:40:23] <+KawaiiJetty> Hey it's the badass
[2:40:26] <%superc37> Oh i love this fucking speech
[2:40:28] <%BioApple> we are born from the cum, made men by the cum, undone by the cum? @Aggro_Will
[2:40:28] <dukenux> not that im complaining Lul
[2:40:31] <Goldenwolf98> I love his sword its so edgelord and dumb I love it
[2:40:31] <ConLin_Plays> Pat woke up early
[2:40:34] <+RushUnplugged> the Onyx gs is great on a pyro
[2:40:37] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yeah, it's a great... sword
[2:40:39] <her0_89> I feel like pat needs more stamina.
[2:40:39] <medril07> why's he in your grill?
[2:40:39] <+Kirbachev> this guy can be a fuckhead to deal with for some builds.
[2:40:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Ur mom gay.
[2:40:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> just parry it
[2:40:47] <doctor_be> end girl is weak to shadow a sawell
[2:40:51] <$RubberFistFight> Not only that, the ending of it all makes the choice at the end of the main game meaningless, since no matter what you do, the flame has guttered out beyond recovery and the world falls to complete ash, and collapses on itself dimensionally and temporally.
[2:40:58] <%JJCheeker> Oh he's got the dark hands
[2:40:59] <nepwar> nonstop infinite heals
[2:41:01] <ConLin_Plays> Heal boy
[2:41:10] <%superc37> @arfsm95 to them it maybe something, but in the grand scheme of things its just another flickering ember waiting to die.
[2:41:11] <Jontman42> @Kirbachev Yeah, in the end there's nobody else left. All the kings and kingdoms are gone, just a bunch of weirdos with a singular intent for something.
[2:41:12] <$DesertPenguin09> What sword is that
[2:41:13] <doctor_be> End the fire ending actually has a sequal hook
[2:41:14] <SkinnersBox> I hate when npcs heal PunOko
[2:41:15] <%around_40_jobbers> not a part of the point down meta LUL
[2:41:15] <dukenux> praise
[2:41:18] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat fun fact: Sister Friede re ignited my nun fetish! an unfortunate event that I still regret to this day!
[2:41:18] <stigna1> @TysonPG Its got a 40-meter ore-radar on the minimap, shows how many nodes are near in a little hud thing, can mine every material there is and is fast and efficient for actually doing the mining. Also, secondary fire on drills zooms in for those weird ceiling nodes.
[2:41:22] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> poor lady Alfred
[2:41:26] <%Aggro_Will> @AngriestPat The real final boss of DS3 should have been Sans.
[2:41:26] <IronEncore> Clang clang clang
[2:41:27] <majindusto> PRAISE IT
[2:41:29] <doctor_be> it implies that an age of fire might happen again, naturally
[2:41:31] <+Daidis> well they dont call it light souls
[2:41:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> HE SAID IT and I clapped!
[2:41:38] <arfsm95> @superc37 yeah, actually is basically an essence of the actual dark soul
[2:41:38] <Bailey__gaming> This is so bloodborney
[2:41:47] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Is it Paige snoring? :P
[2:41:54] <%BioApple> tbh the ending of the ringed city doesn't make much sense when you can just teleport out of the end of the world, like why doesn't everyone do that
[2:41:55] <+kujofire990> take that books
[2:41:59] <fireking900> Praising the Sun = Dabbing. Any Objections?
[2:42:01] <$RubberFistFight> @doctor_be yeah but Gael's arena happens further in the future than that, and the world is literally grey and ash and there's nothing left, and it's all folding inwards on itself.
[2:42:03] <Silent_Fyraena> Whenever someone points down I think of a mouth-breather discovering the floor.
[2:42:08] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Quick, kill her!
[2:42:08] <CheekyBirb> @DesertPenguin09 greatsword, unless you mean the guy who just died, in which case it's the onyx sword
[2:42:08] <%superc37> midir gets a pass since 1. hes a proper ass ancient dragon that was practially ripped from yhe ds1 opening cutscene and 2. his arena is literally where the pygmy found the dark soul
[2:42:09] <%foreverN2dust> reminds me of fake iosefka
[2:42:13] <Bailey__gaming> Open gate
[2:42:14] <synthcutter> tis good
[2:42:14] <doctor_be> Ringed city was temporally locked at the very end of time, just before the true end
[2:42:14] <TioXyco> @fireking900 all the objections
[2:42:15] <Amberizing> tis good
[2:42:18] <%KevinsLunchbox> kill her
[2:42:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> eat her ass
[2:42:23] <fireking900> MURDER THE CHILD
[2:42:30] <Amberizing> kill jester
[2:42:35] <doctor_be> Light=distinction between light and dark, then and now, light is time
[2:42:35] <+imextremelymanly> wow early stream

[2:42:42] <%SmolBluGhost> pfft
[2:42:43] <CheekyBirb> that gate door is so odd and unnecessary
[2:42:45] <majindusto> Kill Child
[2:42:46] <stigna1> I feel like Pat is trying to bait us.
[2:42:48] <zipfile777> dont swear
[2:42:48] <IronEncore> Do combo
[2:42:50] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Give her the old 1-2-skidoo!
[2:42:51] <ConLin_Plays> Do what Big Boss would do!
[2:42:54] <%foreverN2dust> so big, so clever
[2:42:55] <$RubberFistFight> Just because Gwyn is a big fucking baby and was literally afraid of the dark, the entire world falls to shit and is irreparably broken.

[2:45:10] <$RubberFistFight> @doctor_be the thing is, had Gwyn NOT artificially plumped the first flame, and allowed the age of dark to take over, then the fire would have burned low for a while and then magically renewed - it was part of a cycle that had existed for countless ages.

[2:49:02] <valriot> Ah, the real Dark Souls sequel
[2:49:04] <ConLin_Plays> I still need to play Nioh
[2:49:12] <availablethor> Every winter area in games makes me think of Hitman 2 Silent Assassin
[2:49:13] <SovPho> what's a cat's bad dream even like
[2:49:15] <Jontman42> How do you know it's a bad dream
[2:49:20] <nepwar> man nioh loot system really burned me out of the game but i still want to play it
[2:49:33] <+RushUnplugged> weener weener pat's big peener
[2:49:33] <synthcutter> nioh is very overrated. far from perfect. but still pretty good
[2:49:34] <Shooterboy23> Elmo was having a Fightmare like Ron Swanson
[2:49:38] <$RubberFistFight> @Jontman42 i own 3 cats. You can tell the difference between a good one and a bad one.
[2:49:39] <Jontman42> Maybe he's chasing butterflies in the dream
[2:49:43] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat mahbe he dreams of PvPing you in Dark souls
[2:49:47] <doctor_be> It could be a murder dream, cat version of fun dreams
[2:49:49] <dukenux> @availablethor because of the snow castle or the goddamn secret tunnel? LUL
[2:49:50] <TsunTsuchinoko> that's the best part of it
[2:49:51] <valriot> No its not ????
[2:49:52] <Klefth> Yeah, the loot system is just poison
[2:49:52] <synthcutter> nioh is very underrated i mean
[2:49:56] <LixFury> such a fucking hassle
[2:49:57] <Shooterboy23> THANK YOUUU
[2:49:59] <%JJCheeker> Can't believe the PlayStation classic controller doesn't have joysticks
[2:50:02] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[2:50:05] <%foreverN2dust> it's too much, I just end up selling it all and buy a generic weapon
[2:50:10] <+Ryan1016> Well yeah he would lose he doesnt have thumbs
[2:50:10] <SovPho> @AngriestPat how ya feel about inventory and loot systems like FFX
[2:50:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> i was constantly switching weapons every 5 mins
[2:50:14] <Inebriateddonut> I'm really unsure if I like the loot system in Nioh
[2:50:14] <stigna1> Man, secret tunnels are so underrated. Not enough of them IRL.
[2:50:14] <voyagerwitch> pat, you gonna play ashen?
[2:50:15] <%crot45> morning pat, woke up with a text asking me to cover her shift
[2:50:16] <%SergeEXE> PS Classic was a cash grab all around
[2:50:20] <%crot45> yay retail
[2:50:22] <%superc37> i wanna head back into nioh and finish up the dlc, but that last time i went in i immediately put down the controller and went "Its been Too Long"
[2:50:29] <%TysonPG> i didnt like it as soon as i saw it wasnt open world style like dark souls and was like a "select your level" type thing
[2:50:37] <$RubberFistFight> @crot45 "no" is a complete sentence.
[2:50:38] <+gralho> Aint this a feet stream? wheres the feet?
[2:50:42] <ConLin_Plays> Pat is the Grinch
[2:50:46] <serra255> Has Pat taken a look at Ashen, that Soulslike game that just came out?
[2:50:49] <dukenux> not the one in H:SA is underrated. srsly, fuck that level
[2:50:50] <%foreverN2dust> pibbity pat is pat's rapper alter ego
[2:50:52] <stigna1> "You are being stalked by the concept of rhyming. Beware its approach and fear its timing."
[2:50:55] <voyagerwitch> i just asked that :0
[2:50:57] <ChillTonic> Tired Pat is a Beatnik Poet, clearly.
[2:50:57] <Goldenwolf98> I wonder if they are going to change up the loot system for Nioh 2
[2:50:58] <%SergeEXE> Not as good a bit as The Game
[2:51:02] <%superc37> Also yeah the grinding gets rly ridiculous after ng+
[2:51:04] <%SergeEXE> and how you play it
[2:51:14] <+Ryan1016> More money went into that sick ass PS classic commercial than the actual PS classic
[2:51:16] <valriot> @angriestpat you gotta play Nioh so you can fight Jin Hayabusa
[2:51:18] <Silent_Fyraena> I remember when I heard Nioh had a loot system I decided not to even bother checking it out. People made fun of me for it. Glad to know I was right all along.
[2:51:22] <$Rafferty3231> Damn man, you're up early
[2:51:24] <Amberizing> pat when are you gonna get a cool muppet intro
[2:51:25] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat im sorry pat but you're not a rapper...you are slightly better than most of them
[2:51:26] <+masked_hero_lucky> It's 9AM, what the heck is Pat doing awake?
[2:51:27] <voyagerwitch> ive been having a ton of fun with ashen so far
[2:51:35] <stigna1> You know what I mean?
[2:51:36] <+25RPM> Did i sleep for 24 hours? why is pat streaming in the early morning?
[2:51:38] <+Ryan1016> PAT DROP YOUR SHIELD
[2:51:42] <dukenux> DROP
[2:51:43] <nepwar> @superc37 do you think you can finish nioh without having to grind?
[2:51:44] <doctor_be> learning to dodge well is better
[2:51:48] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> wow pat is actually guts
[2:51:49] <+imextremelymanly> drop your greatsword
[2:51:50] <stigna1> @25RPM Woke up early, decided to stream before work.
[2:51:54] <%JJCheeker> I thought it looked kinda boring honestly
[2:51:57] <LixFury> multiplayer dosnt work
[2:51:58] <SovPho> minor problem
[2:52:05] <synthcutter> i hope nioh 2 is a huge upgrade
[2:52:07] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat There are AI companions
[2:52:09] <LixFury> But the AI does it with you
[2:52:09] <+RushUnplugged> just a minor hitch
[2:52:11] <Shaotanzhiten> They supposedly fixed it today?
[2:52:12] <voyagerwitch> pat you get an ai companion
[2:52:14] <+overhaze> Whats up with the multiplayer on PC?
[2:52:14] <+morow1ec> You have ofline bot buddy always with you
[2:52:18] <ConLin_Plays> oh yeah, kinda sucks that Ashen seems to be super multiplayer focused
[2:52:24] <%Chichen> Yes it has ai buddies
[2:52:25] <%SolitudeOtM> Dust off the Xbox?
[2:52:30] <ConLin_Plays> I want single player stuff
[2:52:35] <dukenux> Sekiro hype tho?
[2:52:42] <+terry_quest> so what if the Ai dies?
[2:52:44] <Amberizing> BIG sekiro hype
[2:52:44] <%SergeEXE> Legitimamentally
[2:52:46] <voyagerwitch> i dont think ive seen another real player and ive loved ashen
[2:52:50] <Inebriateddonut> Sekiro hype HUGE
[2:52:51] <synthcutter> Sekiro looks fucking sick
[2:52:53] <%around_40_jobbers> CHONK obtained
[2:53:00] <voyagerwitch> i think if the AI dies they send in another one after a little while?
[2:53:01] <ConLin_Plays> yeah Sekiro looks really fun
[2:53:02] <LixFury> The AI can be pretty ok but it can also be really stupid and irritating
[2:53:05] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat You can literally just turn on an ai partner for the door then immediately turn them off if you wanted to
[2:53:06] <arfsm95> does sekiro have a release date yet?
[2:53:08] <+Ryan1016> Sekiro GO WAY UP
[2:53:11] <$RubberFistFight> omfg cherries are so goddamn delicious
[2:53:14] <synthcutter> march i believe
[2:53:15] <%superc37> @nepwar assuming you do every side quest/twilight mission at least once and do LOTS of hall wuggin; base game yes, dlc No.
[2:53:17] <ConLin_Plays> the art style in Ashen is strong though!
[2:53:21] <fireking900> Didn't RE5 teach us to not use AI for important gameplay shit
[2:53:28] <+Ryan1016> March 22
[2:53:30] <Saiyza> So, Pat why did you start streaming at a reasonable morning hour?
[2:53:31] <Pyr0_Fr0st> Sekiro made me completley forget about Code Vein
[2:53:35] <stigna1> @RubberFistFight Right?! You're a fistfight with good taste.
[2:53:37] <nepwar> @superc37 damn aight
[2:53:48] <ChillTonic> I mean, at least Ashen won't randomly delete your character and have you play as somebody else entirely.
[2:53:49] <synthcutter> so DMCV and Sekiro. my wallet better be ready
[2:53:49] <%foreverN2dust> fuck off, the back swing should have hit that guy
[2:53:52] <her0_89> So pat, you gonna switch to the dual greatswords when you pick them up?
[2:53:57] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat Also the PC version just got a patch yesterday that fixed up the matchmaking problems aparently
[2:54:02] <nepwar> i have a feeling code vein is going to have the same reception as surge did
[2:54:04] <voyagerwitch> fuck this encounter
[2:54:09] <ConLin_Plays> is Code Vein ever coming out?
[2:54:10] <%superc37> @goldenwolf98 same, tho unfortunately i havent seen any comment on it out of "we plan to use feedback from the first to greatly improve the 2nd etc etc."
[2:54:11] <stigna1> @ChillTonic I wanna say beating a dead horse, but fallout 76 is like some sort of masochistic zombie horse. Its great.
[2:54:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> That seems about right. 2 weeks after DMC5.
[2:54:14] <$RubberFistFight> @stigna1 my girlfriend learned a neat trick with cherries. You can pit them easily with a rigid drinking straw, so you don't have to deal with the seed
[2:54:15] <%SergeEXE> It's all about the Greatsword
[2:54:18] <Inebriateddonut> Wait when is Code Vein coming out?
[2:54:19] <%SergeEXE> and how you swing it
[2:54:33] <Amberizing> why has no one invaded pat
[2:54:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> gonna have to watch the vod later, leaving uni now and streams eat through my data
[2:54:39] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat are you going to use the dual greatswords
[2:54:40] <Goldenwolf98> YES
[2:54:40] <Pyr0_Fr0st> Sometime next year
[2:54:40] <LixFury> did it?
[2:54:41] <8bitPapasmurf> Monkas
[2:54:46] <Silent_Fyraena> God I was meant to go to bed on time tonight...
[2:54:46] <stigna1> @RubberFistFight Huh, I'll give that a shot! Thanks for the tips! ^_^
[2:54:53] <Jontman42> Impaling me with sixteen spears does nothing, for I am huge
[2:54:54] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat Ashen/Warframe stream
[2:54:55] <nepwar> yeyeye
[2:54:56] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight Thank your girlfriend for that sick cherry tech
[2:54:57] <T_Sasquatch> code vein was saved from death by its delay
[2:54:58] <Goldenwolf98> Ashen is super worth it
[2:55:00] <stigna1> Bell ahead, but beware of silence. :(
[2:55:02] <Silent_Fyraena> I should have fucked off when Pat told me to.
[2:55:11] <Saiyza> What's Pat's SL right now?
[2:55:17] <synthcutter> FELL TREE
[2:55:19] <+dirtyh4rr1> shortcut missed
[2:55:20] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut i will pass on your approval
[2:55:28] <+cutcrease> treeee
[2:55:29] <%SergeEXE> Really, Pat?
[2:55:35] <CheekyBirb> you missed the kickable tree
[2:55:41] <synthcutter> yeah friede is a bitch
[2:55:42] <Goldenwolf98> Ashen's atmosphere is honestly amazing
[2:55:42] <ConLin_Plays> Babby Patwick
[2:55:42] <Amberizing> you never beet friede solo?
[2:55:44] <doctor_be> you arent really supposed to beat her by yourself, its why you get an NPC summon
[2:55:45] <StryfeDragon> Rest assured, your weapon will melt her
[2:55:45] <valriot> You mean bad Maria?
[2:55:49] <Mr_216> Ol Freddy
[2:55:54] <BakaSurvivah> owww that's a sweet sword
[2:55:56] <+masked_hero_lucky> Guessing Pat already killed wolf champion guy?
[2:55:58] <zipfile777> owo
[2:55:59] <fireking900> When do the angels start shooting lazers or is that the other dlc?
[2:55:59] <%SergeEXE> This is one of my favorite bosses in the game
[2:56:03] <doctor_be> Summoning Gael is basically mandatory
[2:56:05] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[2:56:07] <stigna1> @masked_hero_lucky You guess right!
[2:56:07] <kazadog> @masked_hero_lucky yep
[2:56:09] <Inebriateddonut> Goodbye doggo
[2:56:10] <faegbeard> glad to see Pat up at real australian hours for once
[2:56:11] <%FackinCrazy> IM FREEEEEEEEEE
[2:56:11] <dukenux> LUL
[2:56:16] <+masked_hero_lucky> Aight
[2:56:17] <Amberizing> honestly she's easy once you learn her patterns
[2:56:20] <%FackinCrazy> FREEEE FALLLLLLIN
[2:56:20] <$RubberFistFight> @valriot by "maria" do you mean Of The Astral Clocktower? Coz that fight is so fucking incredibly awesome
[2:56:23] <Amberizing> the first and second phases are nothing
[2:56:26] <+dirtyh4rr1> low on estus and missed the shortcut, nice
[2:56:29] <%SylveriaShinigami> Yeah.. Im with Friede being the hardest in the game. You can cheese Midir out but there's no real trick for Sister.
[2:56:32] <voyagerwitch> i chould never get gael down for some reason
[2:56:40] <%superc37> @nepwar its not as bad as im making it sound, but there will be later bosses thatll be tougher if you dont got the right numbers. especially if youre under the recommended gear level.
[2:56:43] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you missed the kickable tree, dude. Shortcut.
[2:56:44] <CheekyBirb> you missed the kickable tree shortcut earlier
[2:56:45] <synthcutter> midir is easier than friede
[2:56:47] <Amberizing> second you just whack grandpa
[2:56:48] <BakaSurvivah> haiii. yaii...forrcess
[2:56:48] <doctor_be> she MELTS to dark damage
[2:56:48] <Goldenwolf98> second is the most annoying phase
[2:56:52] <kazadog> @AngriestPat fun fact followers torch for some reason always break guard when you kick with it equipped regardless of stamina or stability
[2:56:55] <faegbeard> awoo
[2:56:59] <%Chichen> papa soup takes bonus damage
[2:57:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> bye
[2:57:03] <+Kirbachev> @SylveriaShinigami I can't understand that. Friede I can handle, Midir just buttfucks me every time.
[2:57:04] <%SolitudeOtM> huh, going through stuff on cheat engine and apparently there was a cut "Great Bat" boss and "Wicked Spirit" boss
[2:57:04] <SovPho> your treat is my big meat
[2:57:05] <synthcutter> just because midir doesn't have three fucking phases
[2:57:09] <Tucker0603> my favorite build in this game is Lapp's armor, Earth seeker, and the wolf Knight greatshield
[2:57:11] <$RubberFistFight> oh shit is that Micolash? AWOOOOO!!!

[2:57:20] <Caidezes> WHY
[2:57:20] <Jontman42> Fuckin rekt
[2:57:20] <Who_lio42> @AngriestPat any reason yall didnt run Hardcore mode on DmC: DE? it addressed more gameplay issues than regular DE, too bad story is still shit.

[2:57:26] <Username_Needed> F
[2:57:26] <%foreverN2dust> Has there ever been an instance of publishers positively influencing game development? I'm just thinking of how bamco pushing code vein as a souls game when it was originally announced.
[2:57:27] <voyagerwitch> F
[2:57:29] <$RubberFistFight> YOU UTTER TOOL LOL
[2:57:30] <Amberizing> foolishness, dante

[2:57:35] <+EatinEden> LUL
[2:57:39] <CheekyBirb> pat, you missed the kickable tree shortcut earlier
[2:57:42] <%SergeEXE> I DID MIDIR SOLO
[2:57:43] <dukenux> [easy mode is now unlocked]
[2:57:46] <+Ryan1016> Crazy talk activated
[2:57:46] <valriot> No
[2:57:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You tried.
[2:57:49] <Klefth> Midir is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher with multiple people
[2:57:50] <%SergeEXE> IT TOOK ME 8 HOURS
[2:57:51] <synthcutter> midir is easy
[2:57:53] <%SergeEXE> BUT I DID IT
[2:57:53] <StryfeDragon> Midir is more manageable with one person, honestly
[2:57:57] <SovPho> bosses designed to be fought with multiple people burned me out on MH:W
[2:58:03] <StryfeDragon> And by one person I mean solo
[2:58:09] <TsunTsuchinoko> how is midir for multiplayer more than any other boss?
[2:58:09] <%SolitudeOtM> Midir is actually really easy
[2:58:11] <ConLin_Plays> Remember the Midir fight in the Best Friends stream?
[2:58:11] <%FackinCrazy> Midir is actually much easier solo
[2:58:11] <$RubberFistFight> @SergeEXE I beat him solo on my stream today, it was so goddamn awesome. I thought my heart was gonna beat out of my chest though.
[2:58:17] <Inebriateddonut> I soloed midir but I unknowingly went into the DLC geared SPECIFICALLY for his fight

[2:58:26] <%SergeEXE> To be fair it was right when the DLC came out
[2:58:27] <doctor_be> 10/10
[2:58:28] <nepwar> @superc37 yeah i was already had trouble if the first few bosses so I'll most likely have to grind to progress.
[2:58:28] <AHatMan> I did it solo but being a cleric with lightning helped.
[2:58:28] <katocrimson> ay
[2:58:28] <%superc37> NICE
[2:58:29] <Inebriateddonut> You did good :)
[2:58:29] <%SolitudeOtM> rip
[2:58:29] <availablethor> Can Midir still be cheesed with Pestilent Mercury?

[2:58:30] <%JJCheeker> pvpGrav
[2:58:31] <%SolitudeOtM> F
[2:58:32] <+RushUnplugged> all around from the left LUL
[2:58:33] <stigna1> Midir didn't give me much trouble, but Duke's Dear Freja swept the floor with me for ages, so I'm not much of an authority.
[2:58:34] <faegbeard> there was an attempt
[2:58:39] <Klefth> Midir's HP becomes ridiculous with multiple people. It makes a manageable boss WAY harder.
[2:58:40] <JoeNeutrino> There's always that one person who has to say it's easy. No. It's not.
[2:58:41] <doctor_be> You played yourself
[2:58:42] <ConLin_Plays> GG Pat!
[2:58:47] <dukenux> this is why mountain hiking is dangerous kids
[2:58:49] <%SylveriaShinigami> @availablethor Yup.
[2:58:52] <$RubberFistFight> @Klefth what a lot of people don'
[2:58:55] <Skeletonmanners> pat this armor makes you look fat
[2:59:06] <Goldenwolf98> I had to use the Mercury Spell cheese against Midir when I first beat him LUL
[2:59:08] <doctor_be> Midir is only doable to mage builds via pestulent mist cheese
[2:59:13] <SovPho> if 40k souls is half a level maybe it's time to stop levelling
[2:59:15] <nepwar> does that armor have abs on it??
[2:59:25] <Caidezes> DS2 tree time.
[2:59:31] <Mr_216> take that tree
[2:59:34] <$RubberFistFight> @Klefth what a lot of people don't know is that, after the first attempt, he activates as soon as you drop in - and if you stand perfectly still, his opening tantrum does not hit you, but leaves you positioned right under his chin so you get 2 - 3 free hits.
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:53] <StryfeDragon> @doctor_be I assure you he can be beat under normal conditions solo
[2:59:59] <synthcutter> midir has the easiest reads in the game. his huge hp and the camera angles are the real problem
[3:00:02] <kazadog> @SovPho 120 is pvp meta I think thats what hes aiming for
[3:00:07] <CheekyBirb> oh, guess my shitty ass melee build wasn't able to kill midir twice on ng and ng+ huh, must have dreamt it
[3:00:08] <Klefth> @RubberFistFight Yeah, he's blind.
[3:00:10] <BakaSurvivah> when losing 40k souls means nothing to you..#soswole
[3:00:11] <+Kirbachev> @doctor_be Nah. I haven't kill him, but one of the few times I came close I was Havelling with Millwood battleaxe. Bastard caught me with the laser light show, was the first time I'd seen it.
[3:00:12] <katocrimson> earth magic
[3:00:15] <doctor_be> With a mage build it is nearly impossible due to his insanely high magic resistance
[3:00:17] <$RubberFistFight> @doctor_be i beat him today with a heavy splitleaf greatsword
[3:00:20] <+Kirbachev> It IS doable, he's just an absolute cunt.
[3:00:26] <Tucker0603> EARTH SEEKER IS THE BEST!
[3:00:29] <Jontman42> Midir is mostly difficult because he's tedious, to me anyway.
[3:00:37] <+RushUnplugged> with a mage you just Pestilent Mist midi'rs ass
[3:00:38] <Goldenwolf98> @synthcutter I dont know why they decided to give him that ass load of hp it just made the fight less fun
[3:00:43] <availablethor> He's called Camera Dragon for a reason.
[3:00:47] <kazadog> @doctor_be pestilent mercury is actually one of the best ways to cheese midir
[3:00:50] <SovPho> sl1 or bust
[3:00:51] <+Kirbachev> @Jontman42 Yeah, stupid high HP, get tagged once and you're half-dead.
[3:00:51] <%superc37> @nepwar yeah thats probs a good idea. something to note btw, the recommended lvl doesnt refer to your soul level, but rather your weapons/armor level, so grind appropriately and dont waste time grinding souls for the wring type of level.
[3:00:57] <doctor_be> exactly, I said thats how I beat him
[3:01:07] <arkv01> gottem™
[3:01:08] <kazadog> @doctor_be oops chat scrolled too far my b
[3:01:09] <Klefth> @RubberFistFight Literally blind. If you stay still, Midir only flails around and can't hit you most of the time. Still, you gotta go in to kill him, and with the amount of health he gets in multiplayer, those three free hits mean very little
[3:01:11] <+Quasimofo> I'm working from home due to snow, so finding you streaming was a nice surprise
[3:01:19] <%FackinCrazy> I still haven't killed the ancient dragon even though they apparently fixed that fight in sotfs
[3:01:29] <Jontman42> @Kirbachev Add to that the fact I did the DLC first time on NG+5
[3:01:32] <JoeNeutrino> I don't like the greatsword simply because it's upward swing attack animation is so implausible. It wouldn't realistically deal any damage.
[3:01:35] <elusivebigmac> Jesus Christ how early are you streaming Pat? I just finished my half day at college (UK)
[3:01:37] <kfiz13> just woke up what the fuck pat this is so eary
[3:01:45] <kfiz13> early*
[3:01:46] <+RushUnplugged> greataxe moveset is so mean
[3:01:48] <ConLin_Plays> Chop chop chop
[3:01:49] <kazadog> weapon art dude
[3:01:51] <$RubberFistFight> @Klefth yup. It's a fight where your own reactions do most of his work for him. When people see a big angry dragon bearing down on them their first instinct is to run - but if you do that he'll step on you.
[3:01:54] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat it's my favorite weapon in DS3
[3:02:01] <%superc37> Is that the kirkhammer moveset from bb?
[3:02:10] <%X3nobro> pat looks like a discount Guts
[3:02:12] <%JJCheeker> there was a giant chocolate spill in Germany...It's the most delicious looking accident I've ever seen apatOrange
[3:02:12] <kazadog> @AngriestPat do the earth seeker weapon art
[3:02:15] <availablethor> Nobody runs a faith build Pat.
[3:02:19] <ConLin_Plays> Man the Kirkhammer is so hype
[3:02:30] <$RubberFistFight> It took me about 70 attempts in total, spread out over a few sessions but I finally got the big purple fire-breathing laser-spewing fucker.
[3:02:33] <%foreverN2dust> @kazadog can he with so little faith?
[3:02:34] <doctor_be> faith builds have been bad since the days of the great DS2 lightning nerf
[3:02:35] <Tucker0603> @availablethor AHEM! how dare you
[3:02:44] <$RubberFistFight> @ConLin_Plays nah, it's all about the Burial Blade, baby
[3:02:51] <kazadog> @foreverN2dust he can still do it it will just have terrible damage
[3:02:55] <+KDZen_> Good morning everyone.
[3:02:57] <ConLin_Plays> Maria's swords are also neat!
[3:02:58] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight DAMN that's a lot of attempts
[3:03:05] <$RubberFistFight> the rakuyo? Yeah they are
[3:03:09] <+BunkusFreskie> i assumed pat was a "wake up at noon" kind of guy
[3:03:12] <chancho4tierra> can you do the weapon art without faith?
[3:03:18] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut he's a cunt of a boss, what can i say, lol.
[3:03:21] <%superc37> nope.
[3:03:21] <+RushUnplugged> you don't run a fth build, you just do a faith-adjacent build with 40+str and 30fth, use the dragonslayer greataxe or the lothric knight gs
[3:03:22] <ConLin_Plays> think I used them when I did a Doll based character!
[3:03:23] <zipfile777> ????
[3:03:23] <+KDZen_> Has Pat not played the DLCs yet?
[3:03:24] <nepwar> @superc37 gotcha. I've been playing using only the kursagama and dual katanas since i thought sticking to two types is better than diversifying but people been telling me those two are the worse weapons in the game
[3:03:34] <JoeNeutrino> It doesn't matter if faith isn't optimal.
[3:03:37] <+JD0394> have you fought sister friede since the lp?
[3:03:40] <%foreverN2dust> @KDZen_ didn't he on the LP?
[3:03:45] <+BunkusFreskie> right on man
[3:03:47] <LeaIsChill> !uptime
[3:03:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m 49s.
[3:03:47] <doctor_be> normal people hours?
[3:03:49] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight I need to fight him again this time not geared to fight SPECIFICALLY him
[3:03:50] <+KDZen_> @foreverN2dust Oh of course, my b
[3:03:53] <kazadog> @foreverN2dust wait nvm it will treat it like he has no fp
[3:03:53] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat the earth seeker is my favorite weapon
[3:04:03] <dukenux> That
[3:04:09] <synthcutter> yeyeyeye
[3:04:14] <her0_89> Im quite okay with early pat streams.
[3:04:19] <%FackinCrazy> LIES I bet she told you to go the fuck to sleep
[3:04:22] <tallymark10> Is woolie still jogging
[3:04:25] <dukenux> That's what she said? not "whatever let me sleep its 4am ffs" LUL
[3:04:27] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut I wanted to beat him, maybe off stream and upload the success to youtube, but I finished Bloodborne early today and one of my regulars convinced me to take a few swipes at ol' Middy.
[3:04:27] <Saiyza> @availablethor People run Luck builds before Faith, it's so funny.
[3:04:30] <%Atomik456> well as a gmt+8 guy i support this wholeheartedly
[3:04:34] <%SergeEXE> NG+ only beetch
[3:04:37] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat That's why you NG+
[3:04:37] <%foreverN2dust> You have to do NG+ to get any use out of it
[3:04:41] <+masked_hero_lucky> Ha, imagine if you want weapons in The Ringed City
[3:04:51] <+KDZen_> Bloodborne had that problem the worst. With DLC, weapon pool DOUBLES at the very endgame
[3:05:00] <LeaIsChill> NG+ is really boring to me
[3:05:08] <+Badgerconda_> Pat, why the fuck were you streaming at 4:30 in the morning my time?
[3:05:15] <ConLin_Plays> making a new character is fun
[3:05:16] <+RushUnplugged> Ariandel opens at the cathedral, so technically a lot of these weapons you can get with a suicide run
[3:05:19] <%arknodem> ....Holy shit why is Pat up so ficking early?
[3:05:22] <$RubberFistFight> @KDZen_ if you don't count the uncanny/lost variations there's a lot less weaponry in Bloodborne, and a lot of it is highly specialised.
[3:05:22] <valriot> The intends you to play NG+, but all NG+ in Soulsborne sucks shit, except DS2
[3:05:32] <%foreverN2dust> I hate high level PVP so I never really do NG+
[3:05:38] <CheekyBirb> yeah ng is slightly more fun than ng+m but there're some fun to be had still with continuing to beef up your character
[3:05:51] <T_Sasquatch> I would literally do a whole beast claw playthrough but noooooo bloodborne wants me to go through a bunch of hoops and dungeons
[3:05:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> So I just fought the Eva spirit battle, and the enemies grow stronger when they eat food.
[3:05:57] <+JD0394> @AngriestPat have you fought sister friede since the lp?
[3:05:57] <%jK00215> Pat is back on the crack
[3:05:57] <nepwar> yea but its either give you all the weapons at the start or spread it out so people get the sense of progress
[3:05:57] <Inebriateddonut> Dark Souls NG and beyond oughta work like DMC Difficulties. Would make enemies much more interesting
[3:06:07] <synthcutter> but i wanna get H U G E BibleThump
[3:06:11] <Jontman42> Blowing through those big ass shields is satisfying
[3:06:16] <LeaIsChill> @jK00215 Can't be back on it if you never stopped
[3:06:20] <valriot> Another reason why Nioh is so good, the additional difficulties change up the main game in a bunch of ways
[3:06:22] <$RubberFistFight> @valriot are you kidding? DS2's idea of NG+ is "throw a bunch of random red phantom npcs at you in areas it makes no sense for that particular type of character to be"
[3:06:27] <T_Sasquatch> also i really hate how you have to buy new weapons and armor in bloodborne , and they are super expensive
[3:06:38] <$RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch you don't have to, though.
[3:06:39] <T_Sasquatch> i need my fashion borne
[3:06:54] <CheekyBirb> iirc he's guarding the hammer?
[3:06:54] <T_Sasquatch> @RubberFistFight for fashion i mean
[3:06:56] <+masked_hero_lucky> Stone guardians
[3:06:57] <ConLin_Plays> I'm scared to think about Orphan on NG+ NotLikeThis
[3:07:09] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Isn’t the pitfalls of all rpgs just to make the numbers bigger? It’s all the same.
[3:07:11] <nepwar> which game had the best ng+ mode?
[3:07:13] <SovPho> the giants?
[3:07:14] <Mr_216> My first fight against Orphan was on NG+++. Eff me
[3:07:19] <chancho4tierra> WEAPON ART!!
[3:07:34] <Skeletonmanners> @AngriestPat whats your reaction to the Iceborne announcement
[3:07:38] <%FackinCrazy> Thats really fast for big mace
[3:07:44] <valriot> @rubberfistfight who fuckin cares, its NG+????? Its designed pirely for challenge and difference, not lore consistency
[3:07:54] <kazadog> quakestone hard counter to paired ugs
[3:07:58] <stevenschmee> I miss DS2's ability to make a legitimate tank build. I had so much fun rocking a great sword and a shield.
[3:08:02] <+Kirbachev> @Mr_216 I remember watching a buddy fighting Orphan. Jesus he just looked like bull at the time.
[3:08:12] <+RushUnplugged> I just started MH:W this week, having a blast
[3:08:13] <$RubberFistFight> @ConLin_Plays two tips: 1. fight him out on the water, because you get way more room and there's no rocks to jank his ai out. 2. Have your item bar empty, and when he's at 2/3 health or less, the "use" button will immediately trigger his jump attack, which you can step under, charge R2 and stagger him into a visceral.
[3:08:14] <stigna1> Praise geraldo!
[3:08:17] <SovPho> The attack gem rarity is fucking horrible
[3:08:20] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah having to snipe decorations to get anything decent is ludicrous.
[3:08:21] <+terry_quest> but autumn though T_T
[3:08:22] <$RubberFistFight> Makes a bitch of a fight almost pathetically easy.
[3:08:29] <+JD0394> @AngriestPat have you fought sister friede since the lp?
[3:08:37] <%SergeEXE> @AngriestPat Come to PC, where you can install a mod to buy Decos for Zenny
[3:08:39] <%TysonPG> I stopped playing because gems are so horrid to farm tbh, i fucking love the game besides that
[3:08:41] <+BunkusFreskie> i just hope the inflatable shark returns
[3:08:42] <synthcutter> LUL
[3:08:47] <Username_Needed> LUL
[3:08:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Or they spent hours sniping LUL
[3:08:49] <doctor_be> RNG keeps you playing! that makes us look good for our investors! - developers
[3:08:49] <katocrimson> charms and decos had a swap
[3:08:53] <zepelinnn> i only have 2, with 350hours in
[3:08:57] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you see the new poster for the sonic movie? the one with only the legs showing?
[3:08:58] <TioXyco> How about the Witcher collab adn the return of Nagarcuga? (I have 4 attack gens... I play on consoles.)
[3:09:01] <T_Sasquatch> like eeileens coat is fucking 18000 Blood Echoes
[3:09:09] <+VanaSkiller> modded in?
[3:09:10] <%TheGreatBamBe> @AngriestPat Did the PC version not have the gem dupe glitch?
[3:09:12] <SovPho> @AngriestPat I was kinda new to monster hunter at the beginning of MH:W and I ended up with like 2 attack gems at the start of end game
[3:09:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> Ugh, I hate this room. The sound of buzzing really puts me on edge.
[3:09:17] <%SergeEXE> PC has better stuff
[3:09:17] <SovPho> I haven't seen one since
[3:09:27] <doctor_be> keep it equipped
[3:09:29] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpangu ever gonna play monster hunter with Page?
[3:09:31] <+neroame> Fuck those builds
[3:09:32] <synthcutter> speaking of collabs, that walking dead guy in tekken is just stupid. im sorry
[3:09:32] <%superc37> @nepwar last i played, kusarigama high stance was great for guard breaking/dealing with yokai due to big fast dmg and hyperarmor (but for all i know they couldve nerfed it since i last played so take that with a grain kf salt), and the dual blades were... all right, but not terrible. does need some skills to unlock to be useful, tho. so if you wamna invest, then by all mean since all weapons types are indeed viable. you just need to be aware of the ups and downs of each. I suggest the nioh subre
[3:09:33] <+terry_quest> you can save scum gems on ps4 tedious but possible
[3:09:33] <CheekyBirb> flies bug me in general. giant flies bug me even more
[3:09:36] <$RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch there's a chalice dungeon where a single room of smaller beasts will give you almost 100k echoes in a matter of minutes.,
[3:09:38] <IronEncore> Eww bugoidz
[3:09:39] <+neroame> Every damn time
[3:09:51] <ConLin_Plays> @RubberFistFight wait, so you can literary manipulate his AI???
[3:09:52] <%foreverN2dust> Did they announce the PC release date for Icebo(u)rne?
[3:09:54] <+BunkusFreskie> wow those fly mosters are the worst thing my soul has experienced
[3:09:55] <+Survivor_Seven> That sword really looks like Cloud’s Buster Sword from FFVII. Guess its more basic than i thought
[3:10:03] <synthcutter> instead of bringing back classic characters they add some edge lord from a lame show
[3:10:16] <$RubberFistFight> @ConLin_Plays yup. I used it to beat him. I'll find the part on the VOD and show you.
[3:10:19] <+BunkusFreskie> they have a bad existence feeling
[3:10:24] <DancingMad80> strangeEww giants flies are gross
[3:10:25] <%around_40_jobbers> now THIS is a bloodborne
[3:10:33] <ConLin_Plays> gezuz, no need to show me!
[3:10:42] <%SergeEXE> M-PREG
[3:10:44] <synthcutter> ew
[3:10:45] <CheekyBirb> time to get your torches boiz
[3:10:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind
[3:10:53] <voyagerwitch> oviposition
[3:10:54] <Inebriateddonut> FLY PREGGERS
[3:10:55] <Silent_Fyraena> @AngriestPat Got invaded today by a guy who I swear used estus at least 15 times, maybe 20 or more. So probably cheating unless there's something I don't know? It'd be less infuriating if he wasn't also kinda good.
[3:10:56] <T_Sasquatch> @RubberFistFight you say that but getting to that dungeon is probably longer than just farming in the hypogeon goal area
[3:10:58] <katocrimson> maggots
[3:11:00] <%foreverN2dust> @Survivor_Seven they only thing that is similar is that it's big
[3:11:01] <synthcutter> BIG BLEED
[3:11:13] <+alphonseisbest> whats on the ground?
[3:11:23] <medril07> If you saw this thing in real life, you'd shit your pants
[3:11:24] <stevenschmee> When is Pat going to play Obra Dinn? It seems right up his alley.
[3:11:24] <dukenux> still not as creepy as basilisks
[3:11:26] <+NekoNinja13> why is pat awake so early?
[3:11:26] <arfsm95> how does he not have stats to use A TORCH?
[3:11:32] <CheekyBirb> if you aggro them all, you're likely to get grapple locked
[3:11:33] <+masked_hero_lucky> If you trigger them all I hope you've got wrath of the gods
[3:11:37] <StryfeDragon> I've done that once, you hear the sounds of all of them buzzing and going nuts, it's chaotic Kreygasm
[3:11:38] <Tucker0603> @alphonseisbest maggot eggs and visera
[3:11:39] <%SergeEXE> @arfsm95 it's a MAGIC torch sword
[3:11:41] <%FackinCrazy> Decans have more
[3:11:44] <+Jack8274> @arfsm95 It's not the default torch
[3:11:44] <faegbeard> Nah fam skeleton bridge
[3:11:55] <+RushUnplugged> @Silent_Fyraena yeah there's some people estus-hacking, I got invaded by a guy on a brand new save and he chugged 10+ times
[3:11:56] <synthcutter> gank gang
[3:11:58] <%around_40_jobbers> do you REMEMBER the rat boss fight?
[3:11:59] <+terry_quest> isnt there a mod that increases aggro range?
[3:12:04] <MihajloMBlood> asd
[3:12:05] <+terry_quest> quite funny
[3:12:05] <arfsm95> @SergeEXE that's fucking weird, didn't even know that existed
[3:12:14] <%SergeEXE> whuzzat smell
[3:12:14] <+tunad00d> WTF PAT
[3:12:16] <+Jack8274> You missed an invisibnle wall
[3:12:23] <+tunad00d> ITS 9:30AM
[3:12:24] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you see the new poster for the sonic movie? the one with only the legs showing?
[3:12:28] <Videogamer4> OOF
[3:12:28] <nepwar> @superc37 got it. thanks for the info. once I got some time to learn the loot system, hopefully I can finish it before 2 comes out
[3:12:29] <synthcutter> FRIEDE TIME
[3:12:29] <dukenux> this place looks like it smells AWFUL
[3:12:29] <+BunkusFreskie> invisible wall?
[3:12:31] <Tucker0603> MISSED THE INVISAWALL
[3:12:36] <+alphonseisbest> MAGGOTS LAY EGGS?!!!
[3:12:37] <eco419> Hey Pat I’m on my break how are undoings?
[3:12:44] <+Jack8274> It's very obvious with a torch
[3:12:44] <Inebriateddonut> Around the edge somwhere
[3:12:46] <MihajloMBlood> Underground facility with a crank you have to turn and an invisible wall? Painted world of Dark Souls 1
[3:12:47] <+RushUnplugged> you can see the bricks
[3:12:50] <CheekyBirb> it's noticeable by it's door like outline
[3:12:53] <availablethor> Wait ,did you never find this wall?
[3:12:54] <Inebriateddonut> Look for an archway
[3:12:54] <Videogamer4> the wall has a door outline
[3:12:56] <%foreverN2dust> Jebaited
[3:12:59] <stevenschmee> Obra Dinn and Crosscode are two games I need to see Pat play.
[3:13:02] <+masked_hero_lucky> If there's a wall you'd probably see a message on the ground
[3:13:03] <%tweedler92> looks like a bricked out door
[3:13:07] <+Jack8274> Follow the wall on the right from where you came in
[3:13:14] <$RubberFistFight> @ConLin_Plays just DM'd you a link dude. Check it out at your leisure and discretion.
[3:13:15] <%superc37> tbh the only thing missing from monhun world now is a proper transmog and its basically perfect. like, fuck.
[3:13:24] <Tucker0603> @alphonseisbest my bad, eggs/maggots
[3:13:26] <Inebriateddonut> Also you can hear a lizard on the other side
[3:13:37] <Silent_Fyraena> @RushUnplugged He ran out of estus eventually, but not before took out my friend, 2 blue phantoms and me. Nearly got him, assuming he didn't suddenly heal again.
[3:13:40] <%superc37> @nepwar np dude, always happy to help to the best of my ability
[3:13:52] <+Jack8274> THAT IS MY MESSAGE LUL
[3:13:52] <Mr_216> lol
[3:13:54] <synthcutter> wow
[3:13:55] <+alphonseisbest> @tucker060tunah its cool dude im joking
[3:14:00] <medril07> -what?
[3:14:03] <Inebriateddonut> WALKED PAST IT
[3:14:05] <Mr_216> don't die here
[3:14:08] <+CaptainJax> Pat what the fuck it's 9 AM
[3:14:11] <medril07> how did you know it was there?
[3:14:15] <CheekyBirb> this is the way to the coloseum invader
[3:14:16] <+masked_hero_lucky> The bugoids probably couldn't find it
[3:14:16] <availablethor> BUT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF THE DLC
[3:14:26] <VeryTricky> Cookie bug
[3:14:29] <+white_sasquatch_> Morning from California yall
[3:14:33] <kazadog> @RushUnplugged some people have stacks of siegbrau which has the same animation as estus so he might not have been hacking
[3:14:38] <Videogamer4> THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF THE DLC
[3:14:39] <synthcutter> um...
[3:14:41] <MisterGrowing> @captainjax wait has he been going all night?
[3:14:42] <Mr_216> Alternate? I thought it was the ONLY way to do it
[3:14:44] <CheekyBirb> no, you can't make it all the way down from here
[3:14:44] <Inebriateddonut> Get down there pat and TOUCH FLUFFY TAIL
[3:14:44] <Saiyza> Didn't even bother to use real bricks, just clogged a door with magical illusion bricks...
[3:14:44] <%FackinCrazy> NOONONONONgo back
[3:14:47] <+JD0394> @AngriestPat have you fought sister friede since the lp?
[3:14:47] <Fluxraw> dropt to the ruins pat !
[3:14:47] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you see the new poster for the sonic movie? the one with only the legs showing?
[3:14:48] <StryfeDragon> Most important? Not even close chat
[3:14:51] <%FackinCrazy> JUMP
[3:14:53] <dc_8100> missed the thing in the one place
[3:14:53] <Fluxraw> there is something
[3:14:54] <Videogamer4> Oof
[3:14:56] <$RubberFistFight> @Mr_216 i know, right? XD
[3:15:00] <$iiStarMist> @AngriestPat How many times has Crazy Talk activated?
[3:15:01] <TyrantBelial> No Pat it is something more.
[3:15:02] <CheekyBirb> it's not an alt path
[3:15:02] <TsunTsuchinoko> go down, there is something down there
[3:15:02] <eco419> Secret invasion
[3:15:05] <+Jack8274> You need to be Human for this for an NPC invasion with drop
[3:15:07] <+ZazaruGaru> item there
[3:15:10] <+RushUnplugged> there's stuff down there
[3:15:12] <Videogamer4> go down the branches
[3:15:12] <Tucker0603> THERE'S GOODIES
[3:15:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> Didn't he do this part in the LP? I could have sworn he did this
[3:15:16] <%Tearonex> you can drop to the ruins

[3:26:13] <CaptainKarite> sbfpPatschwitz sbfpPatschwitz sbfpPatschwitz sbfpPatschwitz
[3:26:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> You're lucky you're well-known, no one's up at 6:30 to watch streams.
[3:26:17] <$sleepy_coffee> oh god i need more coffee to deal with this
[3:26:18] <%foreverN2dust> Kappa never
[3:26:20] <%furtivestinbro> apatDab apatDab
[3:26:22] <ConLin_Plays> oh its Bazelgoose
[3:26:28] <Daniel_Is_I> That's a guy who has never played Critical Mode
[3:26:29] <DaHaLoJeDi> That's good sleep hours, I had a lot of trouble sleeping this past weekend
[3:26:29] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> How does Redbull even effect you still?
[3:26:31] <nepwar> man I wonder how that recording session is gonna go now that youve been up longer than usual LUL
[3:26:43] <Pixel_gee> Critical KH2 is pretty challenging, to be fair.
[3:26:46] <dukenux> oh right
[3:26:49] <+terry_quest> i prefer KH2 gameplay over 1 minus the press triangle
[3:26:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Press triangle to win
[3:26:53] <dukenux> they still are playing ST LUL
[3:26:59] <SovPho> difficulty in a video game isn't always pivotal to gameplay
[3:27:01] <stigna1> @masked_hero_lucky A lot of it seems to be EU/ international folks, and it seems to be workout out for em.
[3:27:06] <dukenux> survive
[3:27:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> If you swing first you're never wrong
[3:27:09] <ConLin_Plays> Critical KH2 is so good, I love how they made it
[3:27:20] <+terry_quest> BBS is my fave gameplay wise
[3:27:25] <RekknLIVE> still waiting for the next omnicron disaster lp.
[3:27:25] <$RubberFistFight> if you throw a lloyd's talisman at a mimic it'll yawn and fall asleep, and drop its item so you don't have to fight it
[3:27:32] <+terry_quest> bc i wanna be big stronk with big fancy moves
[3:27:35] <ConLin_Plays> BBS secret bosses are BS though
[3:27:37] <%foreverN2dust> If you aren't feeling the red bull anymore I recommend taking an L-Theanine supplement.
[3:27:41] <%blaccbird914> I love KH2 but BBS has the best battle system in my opinion
[3:27:43] <katocrimson> I just realise pat is wearing a bazelguse t-shirt
[3:27:59] <%foreverN2dust> snowso1Wut
[3:28:01] <doctor_neato> @AngriestPat Which is better in your opinion? Dark Souls, Demon Souls, or Bloodborne?
[3:28:07] <+terry_quest> man pat looks rather dead
[3:28:09] <%Ninestempest> I DO NOT LIKE THAT
[3:28:10] <%foreverN2dust> snowso1Creep

[3:29:26] <%Kravedarknesss> I've been told no matter how wide I open my eyes they still look half closed
[3:29:27] <+terry_quest> and how are you not sponsered yet?
[3:29:29] <gespenst_mr_ghost> I love this guy's voice

[3:29:44] <synthcutter> that scottish accent is awesome
[3:29:45] <+MichaelScarnFBI> good luck Pat
[3:29:45] <+Mistheart101> Pat is half piss (because of the gout) and half Red Bull (because of the Red Bull)
[3:29:47] <+jisang0415> IS THIS ALTFATHER LLOYD?
[3:29:48] <Amberizing> just watch vaati
[3:29:54] <%TysonPG> he fucking loves fire
[3:29:54] <Nitesco> muh flauhel BibleThump
[3:29:55] <dukenux> ...Santa?
[3:29:55] <Inebriateddonut> I feel like I recently heard this voice actor in something
[3:29:57] <+maxKamui> He forgot the safe word
[3:29:59] <TsunTsuchinoko> he's the painting guy, not much else
[3:29:59] <+CaptainJax> He's Smough
[3:30:00] <rosemon5001> HE LIKES THE WHIP*WHIP NOISE*
[3:30:01] <urkleturtle> he's big
[3:30:01] <+neroame> Holy shit
[3:30:02] <JoeNeutrino> I wish many things about DS3's story were better.
[3:30:03] <StryfeDragon> They were about to burn their home but Friede convinced him and was like "nah man you should let everything rot it'll be great"
[3:30:03] <%furtivestinbro> the large father and his mixing bowl.
[3:30:04] <$RubberFistFight> @synthcutter "pleeez, breng me mah fleehhhll"
[3:30:06] <+Lostinafantasy> Watch Vaati
[3:30:08] <CheekyBirb> aside from using his blood to keep the flame going in to keep the paintng alive? nothing
[3:30:12] <synthcutter> Muh Flail
[3:30:12] <Inebriateddonut> OH YEAH I think the VA might be in Deracine
[3:30:15] <%superc37> well, hes the painter of the world, he met friede, and then was like "fuck the fire"
[3:30:16] <DaHaLoJeDi> This guy's deal is flailing himself to use his blood and staunch the flame that's meant to burn the painted world and make room for a new one
[3:30:21] <ConLin_Plays> tiny head
[3:30:22] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat he's a corvian painter that restored the painting
[3:30:38] <$RubberFistFight> such great voice acting
[3:30:40] <Saiyza> hey pat, ah, err, don't die, yeah
[3:30:41] <fireking900> I like how this whole DLC i pretty much all the NPC telling you " You dont have to do this, You're just killing us cause you can"

[3:30:50] <%sleepy_coffee> ...Thheeiner head
[3:30:53] <%astropupp> hell of a bad hair day
[3:30:54] <stevenschmee> Kingdom Hearts 2 is where my mind goes when I hear "fun ARPG". It's the perfect "easily accessible but has a huge skill ceiling".
[3:30:56] <$RubberFistFight> "sewn well eht serrge"
[3:30:57] <Tucker0603> HIS ACCENT IS AMAZING!
[3:30:58] <ConLin_Plays> PogChamp

[3:32:18] <Veriior> Pat seems to be poising through attacks, did they fix poise?
[3:32:18] <Inebriateddonut> You can tell which way she jumps by how the snow looks when she does
[3:32:19] <+terry_quest> yes just poise through that shit

[3:33:04] <IronEncore> ITS BLUD
[3:33:04] <jack_s1n> it's just a snickers bar
[3:33:07] <Caidezes> I love his scream.
[3:33:08] <DaHaLoJeDi> And the cool part about this is that, to keep her alive, this guy starts the fire that he's been holding back all this time

[3:33:38] <Videogamer4> POINTING AT THE STANS
[3:33:38] <stevenschmee> @majindusto use Link if you're having trouble. His up smash and side smash still have multiple hits, and as a result the AI isn't able to dodge the second swing.
[3:33:38] <+Felremi> open a vrin you get blood
[3:33:38] <ConLin_Plays> the chair stuck on his butt is silly

[3:37:12] <Koopardon> Hey Pat, how do you like Yhorm's Great Machete? I mained it when I first played through DS3
[3:37:16] <$RubberFistFight> @iiStarMist that's the next dlc so i'd imagine he would when he does that
[3:37:17] <mcevers> Is the stream tax becoming less a thing with all your XP?
[3:37:18] <Grandma_Amari> I am so going to do a pyromancy build later
[3:37:20] <%topendbuzz> why is chat in slow mode??? what did you guys do????
[3:37:31] <ConLin_Plays> I like it when it's slow!
[3:37:34] <stevenschmee> Just power wield two UGS's.
[3:37:36] <Koopardon> Slow mode is comfier
[3:37:37] <+CaptainJax> big poise big boyz
[3:37:37] <%Ninestempest> Chat is probably a big OOF at 5 in the morning
[3:37:38] <eco419> Good luck ol chump
[3:37:38] <MegboyManuel> @topendbuzz was like this when he started
[3:37:39] <fireking900> its just 5 secs its to stop spam
[3:37:40] <rosemon5001> @Inebriateddonut i know and it sucks because i feel like the true reason for it was scrubbed from the game totally not even anything left in the files
[3:37:49] <Tucker0603> @inebriateddonut i always thought the tail in the back is what remains of Pricilla after she passes away
[3:37:50] <CheekyBirb> slow mode is barely noticeable so whatever
[3:37:53] <$RubberFistFight> yeah when it's slow its a little easier to talk, and Pat's more likely to respond coz it's not going by at breakneck pace
[3:38:02] <leinadtonu> gotta go back to work, good luck Pato. Keep kicking ass.
[3:38:02] <DaHaLoJeDi> the amount of disrespect
[3:38:08] <+Gruntini> he srem

[3:40:25] <+overhaze> Well you have that big Eff you sword now
[3:40:28] <MetalMongger> anyway back to work lol
[3:40:29] <stevenschmee> Remember when Pat died to Pinwheel?
[3:40:34] <Klefth> @majindusto She's way tougher than Maria.
[3:40:34] <$RubberFistFight> @majindusto if Pat went against maria with this strategy she'd take him apart. No poise in BB and shes WAY too fucking fast for this kind of weapon.
[3:40:37] <Josef_Stryker> Is Pat refusing to summon Gael btw?
[3:40:37] <+teamjflight> @MetalMongger Who?
[3:40:39] <Saiyza> @metalmongger Don't you mean Infiltration from the fgc scene?
[3:40:42] <eco419> Crazy talk go
[3:40:44] <squirtkitten> Its an odd world we live in where Pat of all people is the most competent concerning video games
[3:40:49] <$RubberFistFight> @stevenschmee I saw that live. It was delicious.
[3:40:50] <squirtkitten> out of the group i mean
[3:40:51] <Grandma_Amari> The only thing I really dont care for about DaS3 is how there's so many unanswered or unfinished feeling plot threads.
[3:41:03] <majindusto> Pat died to Pinwheel? lol
[3:41:12] <thepowerofpinsol> Does Pat typically stream this early?
[3:41:12] <Grandma_Amari> Like I was super interested in what that mannequin snake statue thing was about.
[3:41:14] <ConLin_Plays> how do you even die to Pinwheel?
[3:41:25] <$RubberFistFight> @majindusto right after shit-talking him about being pathetically easy. It was hilarious.
[3:41:26] <zipfile777> mans not hot
[3:41:28] <MisterGrowing> @thepowerofpinsol no lol
[3:41:29] <Caidezes> Crazy Talk in effect.
[3:41:31] <roo_bun> F for that framerate
[3:41:33] <squirtkitten> @ConLin_Plays i did, missed which clone was the real one and got one shot by the fireball

[3:41:41] <%claybore> JOHNS
[3:41:42] <Saiyza> @conlin_plays It's the only way to pay homage to Giant Dad
[3:41:46] <Grandma_Amari> @thepowerofpinsol He apparently went to bed early and got up at like 4:30 lol
[3:41:47] <EJLeen> Do I sense Johns?
[3:41:50] <+Kirbachev> @Grandma_Amari I hear. I mean I get that ambiguity is the big thing about the series, but there's a lot of shit just left hanging.
[3:41:52] <+JD0394> @AngriestPat do you just not see the ice when fighting. youve been launched like 5 times
[3:41:52] <Josef_Stryker> @Grandma_Amari It's like Twin Peaks in how the end only leaves you with more questiosn while refusing to answer the questions you already have
[3:41:59] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat they're healing
[3:42:00] <dukenux> This is a negative progress
[3:42:04] <stevenschmee> Pat the type of guy to die to Pinwheel and the choir boys from DS2, but crush Pontiff in a single attempt.
[3:42:08] <333agus333> STAB THAT BUTT
[3:42:11] <thepowerofpinsol> @Grandma_Amari all right. I was going to say that would explain why I always miss his streams

[3:44:28] <Saiyza> Crystal Lizard taught us not to fear the crystal walls.
[3:44:29] <DuoScratch> Yeah, that's how I killed Friede, a Bleeding Greatsword. XDDDDD
[3:44:38] <$RubberFistFight> yeah it just carves chunks out of their health like crazy
[3:44:43] <Kaweta> blackflame ice scythe waifu has some edge but the real edge is fuggin BLOOD FIRE DARTH MAUL zombie waifu

[3:44:54] <Mr_216> The no Mixup Mixup
[3:44:55] <ConLin_Plays> I think they wanted to go Bloodborne with this DLC

[3:44:58] <TerraWraith> You walked into that one literally
[3:45:10] <%Guntherkiin> Oh pats up early
[3:45:16] <+Jack8274> That kick LUL
[3:45:17] <Inebriateddonut> @ConLin_Plays I think they wanted to go bloodborne with the entire DS3 game
[3:45:21] <Tucker0603> @rubberfistfight that actually makes sense in world, considering Crow man always flays himself
[3:45:23] <yukichocomilk> going after her is a trap
[3:45:26] <333agus333> @mr_216 that's rhe fucking strong mixup
[3:45:26] <stevenschmee> Maria is more important lore-wise and one of the only bosses in Bloodborne with an obvious backstory. She's the perfect boss for a DLC.

[3:45:42] <fireking900> i think LM is a ay better fight cause she just has 2 phases and 1 life bar but this chick needs 3 phases and life bars. it just kindafeels cheep after a while
[3:45:42] <+Jack8274> The damage Kreygasm
[3:45:46] <Jontman42> I've never seen that
[3:45:47] <%blaccbird914> didnt know that was possible
[3:45:47] <+Krymming> Sword is too great
[3:45:54] <TerraWraith> Round 3! FIGHT!
[3:46:00] <333agus333> taunt to bodied combo incoming?
[3:46:07] <ape_hawk> so, is anyone else hyped for Crisis on Infinite Earths?
[3:46:07] <Caidezes> Now remember to dodge the ice.
[3:46:10] <DaHaLoJeDi> WOW I didn't know you could do that
[3:46:12] <TyrantBelial> now don't do empty swings
[3:46:15] <eco419> Win this now
[3:46:16] <synthcutter> god damn
[3:46:17] <+aversal_ammar> Pat about to get bodied again
[3:46:17] <Kaweta> Pat points to stands
[3:46:18] <Videogamer4> YOU SHALL KNOW THIS DEVILS POWER
[3:46:23] <axelcezar> this 3 phases boss fight is ridiculous
[3:46:26] <%topendbuzz> is this anime?
[3:46:26] <TyrantBelial> 1-2 pat, she's a PC she conly gets staggered for 2 hits just let her go after 2.
[3:46:33] <availablethor> Attacking Ariandel is so much easier in this phase. You can kill him so fast Friede doesn't have time to cast heal. It seems like a 3 round fight but it's only really 2 once you know what you're doing.
[3:46:35] <majindusto> Don't get Cocky
[3:46:41] <stevenschmee> Greatswords are so fun in the DS games.
[3:46:45] <urkleturtle> right said friede - too sexy for these souls
[3:46:50] <ConLin_Plays> NotLikeThis
[3:46:52] <+Krymming> parry that ladydude
[3:46:53] <Grandma_Amari> I feel like this boss fight is amazing, but the rest of the DLC just feels kinda...eh.
[3:47:03] <$RubberFistFight> rubber16Sunbro
[3:47:04] <Shooterboy23> vergil would totally rock a scythe

[3:47:58] <+Kongro_> Oh yeah, they fucking moved the bonfire closer to that

[3:48:04] <+Felremi> boom
[3:48:04] <%D_day> Pat Sleep schedule go down
[3:48:06] <Caidezes> Aaaand he missed the bonfire.
[3:48:08] <availablethor> It's a very short DLC, it really feels like deliberately cut content that could've been in the main game, just like the original Ariamis.
[3:48:14] <JoeNeutrino> It's never explained because hasty rewrites.
[3:48:14] <Kaweta> Vaati pls
[3:48:20] <stevenschmee> Ringed City feels weird. It's bosses are top tier but it's not a great location. It's the same way I feel about DS2's DLC.
[3:48:21] <%foreverN2dust> @RubberFistFight please explain
[3:48:22] <Veriior> A metal album cover
[3:48:23] <Jontman42> Yeah the snake person was nothing
[3:48:25] <DuoScratch> yeah, that's the way I always get to the Dreg Heap
[3:48:30] <+masked_hero_lucky> Welcome to the end of the world
[3:48:33] <Tucker0603> THERE'S TWO BONFIRES YA HIT THE WRONG ONE
[3:48:41] <Pixel_gee> It feels like they split 1 DLC into 2
[3:48:48] <CheekyBirb> it's only the boss bonfire that's right next to the church bonfire, whatever
[3:48:48] <$RubberFistFight> @foreverN2dust it's in a piece of dialogue, or on an item, but it's not a theory, it's a definite link. lemme find it.
[3:48:51] <Captain_Joe1911> Cool morning stream BloodTrail
[3:48:55] <%superc37> also, I do love how the fact that shes ashen implies that she, a founding member of the sable church, left the chrurch, tried to link the fire, failed, and when the bell rung she fucked off to the painting in shame
[3:49:02] <Grandma_Amari> @stevenschmee I can see that. Honestly though, the DLC for DS2 was probably the best part of it.
[3:49:04] <Shooterboy23> @Pixel_gee because they did. it was supposed to be 1 dlc for twice the price.
[3:49:06] <Amberizing> well the other isnt an actual bonfire
[3:49:12] <availablethor> That too, considering Gael is in both.
[3:49:13] <Amberizing> it just sends you to the dreg heap
[3:49:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Oh damn I just remembered it’s leg day.
[3:49:15] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk
[3:49:17] <medril07> Watching Pat stream and Star Trek tng. life is good
[3:49:19] <+ZazaruGaru> they added the 2nd one with the release of the ringed city
[3:49:20] <%SolitudeOtM> the other isnt a bonfire
[3:49:20] <%around_40_jobbers> This place sure is on fire. Is THAT the eternal flame?
[3:49:24] <$RubberFistFight> @foreverN2dust from the wiki: "Yuria is one of three sisters which founded the Sable Church of Londor. The youngest sister's name is Liliane and the eldest's name is Elfriede."
[3:49:25] <Fluxraw> You did it.
[3:49:25] <stigna1> Big and strong
[3:49:27] <ConLin_Plays> Weow
[3:49:28] <+Jack8274> @Grandma_Amari The Ringed City is my favorite DLC of all Dark Souls. The final boss is legendary.
[3:49:28] <Grandma_Amari> I wonder if that second bonfire was meant to be a plot thing, considering it's right in front of the snek
[3:49:28] <Jontman42> Wish they had something other than a fake bonfire for the teleports
[3:49:28] <stevenschmee> Ubisoft took a note from this game by releasing Odyssey's DLC in parts.
[3:49:31] <Caidezes> Now you can go Star Trek in peace.
[3:49:32] <%Guntherkiin> time to get even more huge
[3:49:35] <Amberizing> the dreg heap is such a cool area
[3:49:45] <Mr_216> RIP Freddy'
[3:49:45] <DaHaLoJeDi> NOW DO THE SMASH
[3:49:51] <%PalmtopNami> wait thats the final boss of the dlc??
[3:49:52] <ConLin_Plays> DansGame
[3:49:53] <PowerfulBlackGangs> What SL should you be for the Borg Queen?
[3:49:54] <Saiyza> 61 str... Pat is legit HUGE
[3:49:56] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight wait where did we get the name of the third sister?
[3:49:57] <+aversal_ammar> Pat is too huge
[3:49:58] <%around_40_jobbers> @AngriestPat Congratulations. You killed 2 people who wanted to be left alone for a single strength stat point
[3:49:59] <$RubberFistFight> @foreverN2dust that's how she knows that you're ash, it's how she knows that you're the lord of londor, and it's why she wants you out of the painting.
[3:50:02] <+morow1ec> Eating soul of your enemie for money - the ultimate BM
[3:50:04] <333agus333> i think you can talk to the painter
[3:50:04] <CheekyBirb> ashes is really short if you know where everything is
[3:50:08] <Kaweta> so i'm guessing he doesn't have a dab emote mod
[3:50:08] <SpoonJuggler> hey shitlords
[3:50:11] <synthcutter> you forgot the slab Pat
[3:50:11] <DaHaLoJeDi> unless smash already happened
[3:50:13] <%foreverN2dust> neat
[3:50:14] <stevenschmee> BED OF CHAOS 4 Smash Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:50:16] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat Now go brag the Star Trek lip about how big and strong you are
[3:50:19] <+Jack8274> @PalmtopNami Yes
[3:50:26] <Saiyza> @powerfulblackgangs Apparently, developers say SL80 for the dlc
[3:50:35] <Inebriateddonut> Talk to crow guy again for a slab
[3:50:36] <+dirtyh4rr1> crowman has sla
[3:50:41] <Fluxraw> u have it already, u get it after phase 2
[3:50:42] <+masked_hero_lucky> No, he got it, you get it automatically for killing Ariandel
[3:50:43] <synthcutter> Go back to the Bird guy
[3:50:43] <%around_40_jobbers> RETURN THE SLAB
[3:50:45] <CheekyBirb> slab from corvian settler
[3:50:46] <Videogamer4> the crowman in the village
[3:50:48] <+Mistheart101> Return the slaaaaab or suffer my cuuuuurse
[3:50:48] <synthcutter> yes
[3:50:49] <Amberizing> if you talk to the crow in the village you get a slab
[3:50:50] <@SSaryn> Pat what the FUCK I JUST WOKE UP
[3:50:51] <Grandma_Amari> I wonder which character would be most likely for Smash from Dark Souls. Solaire seems obvious, but Chosen Undead would be nice too.
[3:50:51] <%furtivestinbro> the crow man who talks to you
[3:50:52] <Caidezes> Yes.
[3:50:52] <Inebriateddonut> Yup the one in the screaming bird town
[3:50:53] <+ZazaruGaru> sickly crow guy in house
[3:50:54] <+masked_hero_lucky> Wait, there's another one?
[3:50:54] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut when you beat her and take her soul to yuria you get this: "Ahh, our Lord and Liege. Twas the soul of my sister. Elfriede...A poor wench turned to Ash, who would abandon Londor... If thou wouldst, let it nourish they Lordship. And in return, do her one small kindness. Remember those who stayed by her to the end, in the shadows cast by fire... And lastly, my Lord, take up thy rightful mantle, of usurper."
[3:50:55] <%SolitudeOtM> crow boy in the house in the settlement
[3:50:56] <dc_8100> yeah the crow guy in crow village
[3:50:58] <Videogamer4> in the crow village

[3:51:37] <Videogamer4> SPIN 2 WIN
[3:51:42] <fireking900> It funny how he has 61 SRT but with 99 Hollowing he looks like a skeleton under all that armor
[3:51:58] <availablethor> This is the most Mount Arreat fight ever.
[3:52:11] <%furtivestinbro> they really don't want you in that bird cage.
[3:52:18] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut she gets mentioned in one of the braille tomes, and she's kneeling at the end in the "usurpation of fire" ending
[3:52:18] <Fluxraw> the coil fragment is also a Slab @AngriestPat buy homewards instead
[3:52:19] <Saiyza> Basic enemy fodder drone #1 defeated!

[3:53:28] <Grandma_Amari> I fucking thought that the post was a fake until I started seeing it all over
[3:53:28] <Amberizing> outside

[3:53:45] <T_Sasquatch> Its very telling how they haven't shown his face yet LUL
[3:53:47] <DaHaLoJeDi> Someone photoshopped that poster to look like a Goosebumps book cover and it's fucking hilarious
[3:53:53] <+Jack8274> BibleThump
[3:53:53] <urkleturtle> that poster is an actual photo of the guy running the sonic twitter
[3:53:57] <synthcutter> S L A B

[3:54:21] <%JJCheeker> it says "Sonc wuz Here" On the San Francisco bridge in that poster
[3:54:22] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if you already know this then apologies, but if you take Friede's soul to Yuria you get some unique dialogue.

[3:54:45] <%foreverN2dust> mmmm
[3:54:48] <availablethor> These guys have it figured out. Avoid the Age of Dark by living inside a painting parallel universe.
[3:54:52] <Bouldus> why is chat in slow mode? was it getting spammy?
[3:54:52] <CheekyBirb> yuria's dialogue should still proc
[3:54:55] <MegboyManuel> he's implying that the age of fire should end
[3:54:55] <derap41> Is the world of dark souls just another painting
[3:54:56] <fireking900> YEYEYEY LAZER ANGELS
[3:54:57] <Gary_Plays_Games> what the heck is this stream time

[3:55:05] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oof. She explains that, among other things, Friede was her sister.
[3:55:05] <%JJCheeker> apatWhat apatWink apatWink
[3:55:05] <%SolitudeOtM> You can talk to Yuria anyway
[3:55:06] <Jontman42> Just proactively reboot the world
[3:55:10] <MegboyManuel> Birdman tells the outside world to end the fire
[3:55:15] <soraabora> good morning!!
[3:55:22] <CaptainKarite> I love this fucking dlc
[3:55:24] <TyrantBelial> Nope! It's the same flame myth, they just don't fear the dark and know they have to continuet he cycle rather then stall it like Gwyn started.
[3:55:25] <derap41> gotta turn it off and on again
[3:55:27] <+aversal_ammar> Is Elmo the first flame?
[3:55:28] <Jontman42> Ypu

[3:56:01] <Kaweta> spread dem cheeks and i'll brim those goodies out of you granny
[3:56:04] <ChillTonic> Man, Welsh accents in video games have become rather vogue in the past 5 years, eh?
[3:56:09] <Bouldus> looks like Guan yu's weapon Kappa
[3:56:09] <%SolitudeOtM> Split leaf is a great strength weapon
[3:56:10] <CheekyBirb> spin to win halberd

[3:56:44] <synthcutter> Gael is the real hero
[3:56:45] <$RubberFistFight> @ChillTonic they're rare, that's why. I was born in Wales but I've lived in Australia all my life, and my lack of welsh accent makes me sad. It's a fantastic sound.

[3:59:06] <ConLin_Plays> @AngriestPat Don't forget work!
[3:59:16] <CheekyBirb> it's apparently cavities
[3:59:20] <Videogamer4> SMASH
[3:59:20] <%SolitudeOtM> @angriestpat those are what became of the slave knights
[3:59:21] <%around_40_jobbers> I like to think that they are the rocks on the hollows backs made manifest
[3:59:24] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat and that's the sword the hag was selling isn't it?
[3:59:25] <%furtivestinbro> old knights consumed by humanity
[3:59:25] <majindusto> No Head
[3:59:26] <Xiangchang> They have maximum poise.
[3:59:27] <IronEncore> Love the design to them
[3:59:28] <Jontman42> Oh lawd he swingin
[3:59:29] <+Jack8274> try finger, but hole
[3:59:29] <Grandma_Amari> Can't stagger this big bois with big poise
[3:59:29] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat they're called Harald knights. They went so hollow they turned into humanity shades sort of "haunting" their own bloated armor.
[3:59:40] <DaHaLoJeDi> Quick everyone, imagine up an American Reboot of Dark Souls, DS: Dark Souls
[3:59:42] <nepwar> that humanity hole
[3:59:42] <Xiangchang> Literally a big poise for big boys.
[3:59:43] <Bouldus> is that the effigy from ds2? Kappa
[3:59:46] <axelcezar> just leap attack this fat bastard to death
[3:59:47] <faegbeard> humanity face hole
[3:59:48] <availablethor> There's something about trees in this universe that was never explained. Like the hollows in Lothric that grow into trees.
[3:59:48] <+abadbadman> remiinds me of those dumb fucking giants in DkS2
[3:59:48] <Amberizing> you can instakill them with a plunging attack
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <Saiyza> People invade with that weapon...
[3:59:52] <fireking900> Hes head so now made of fart gas
[3:59:57] <%blinkinthedark> I'm going to sleep, Have a good day Pat
[4:00:02] <$RubberFistFight> @Bouldus basically yes
[4:00:03] <Inebriateddonut> @RubberFistFight okay how do you go double hollow?
[4:00:04] <Skeletonmanners> they're like ds 2 giants but with FAT ASSES
[4:00:05] <availablethor> Based hydration bot.
[4:00:06] <TyrantBelial> They're the fucking cthulhu priests from The Old Hunters, with the Bell Hammrs
[4:00:09] <%SolitudeOtM> the Herald knights are the sla e knights
[4:00:10] <fireking900> Hydrate Bot PogChamp
[4:00:10] <jack_s1n> thanks water bot
[4:00:11] <IronEncore> It's tanglers big brother
[4:00:12] <CheekyBirb> the tree roots stuff is apparently cavities
[4:00:12] <TyrantBelial> they're literally the same enemy type

[4:00:16] <Grandma_Amari> Thanks @Stay_Hydrated_Bot
[4:00:16] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight yea i know i was being a smart arse :P
[4:00:18] <majindusto> Praise Eclipse
[4:00:20] <+masked_hero_lucky> Pop a giant seed and send all the enemies he's probably standing next to after him
[4:00:20] <@SSaryn> Can the Americanized version of Dark Souls just be located in Missouri? Kappa
[4:00:28] <IVIoi101> best dagger
[4:00:30] <Klefth> The coolest, most useless weapon in the series
[4:00:31] <thepowerofpinsol> If you think I am going to drink 16oz in 4 hours you are soooooo wrong
[4:00:35] <+Krymming> tree root stuff is skincancer
[4:00:37] <+JayEarly> @dahalojedi open with wide shot of protagonist ploughing whores
[4:00:37] <$RubberFistFight> @Inebriateddonut eh it's more like they went hollow and stayed hollow for SO LONG in an area permeated by the power of the dark soul that they became that
[4:00:39] <Caidezes> I love the aquamarine dagger. Shame it sucks.
[4:00:40] <+Jack8274> Oscar
[4:00:42] <+ZazaruGaru> Oscar
[4:00:43] <fireking900> Oscar
[4:00:43] <+alphonseisbest> i think that the lightsaber pat
[4:00:44] <Klefth> Well, one of the coolest and most useless
[4:00:48] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I don't get people who say from was ignoring DS2 existed even though it has several items, mechanics and an area in this DLC from DS2
[4:00:50] <%foreverN2dust> tickle me oscar
[4:00:51] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat they are the one of the many forms of twitch chat big whit an gaping hole from where darkness spews
[4:00:52] <IVIoi101> i was trying to invade pat.. but oscar stole it
[4:00:53] <%crot45> hey pat when you getting into 40k?
[4:00:57] <Videogamer4> Oscar the true hero of dark souls
[4:01:00] <+Kirbachev> @Caidezes Same. It has so much style.
[4:01:01] <Saiyza> Oscar of Astora
[4:01:04] <Gary_Plays_Games> you saw him through the window down there
[4:01:12] <Bouldus> lol
[4:01:14] <LeaIsChill> This dude LuL
[4:01:15] <TyrantBelial> Cus those things only showed up in this DLC at the very end. The game prior to this DLC, heavily ignored 2.
[4:01:16] <Inebriateddonut> HE'S PLAYING THE LONG GAME
[4:01:17] <T_Sasquatch> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 shhh dlc bad, stop using your brain
[4:01:17] <majindusto> Don't tickle the Oscar
[4:01:18] <%furtivestinbro> take that Dark Souls 2 fall damage
[4:01:21] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! BloodTrail
[4:01:23] <DaHaLoJeDi> @JayEarly also the Chosen Undead is no longer silent and every other line of dialogue is FUCK YOU
[4:01:25] <JoeNeutrino> Well I respect his persistence.
[4:01:27] <@SSaryn> Wow this guy is really determined to use that Storm Ruler
[4:01:30] <%around_40_jobbers> I like this guys spunk
[4:01:46] <+Jack8274> He's just playing with you mang
[4:01:46] <Jontman42> I don't think it's upgraded
[4:01:47] <%SolitudeOtM> gotta respect the dedication to the shitty weapon
[4:01:47] <availablethor> Oscar is resolute to make this an act of giant slaying.
[4:01:48] <AliveAleks> but if he beats you with it youll never live it down
[4:01:57] <Fluxraw> oscar doesnt know, your a small guy, the stormruler only works on giants Kappa
[4:01:59] <+abadbadman> see if you can parry it @AngriestPat :p
[4:02:02] <Bouldus> o//
[4:02:03] <CheekyBirb> storm ruler just doesn't work, even on the normal giants. it's only good for yhorm
[4:02:06] <Captain_Joe1911> nice Pat BloodTrail
[4:02:06] <+abadbadman> dang
[4:02:07] <Kaweta> so close
[4:02:07] <+Kirbachev> fuggin lul
[4:02:08] <+masked_hero_lucky> I wish Storm Ruler was stronger...
[4:02:08] <Who_lio42> no dammy lol
[4:02:09] <+ZazaruGaru> /clap
[4:02:10] <DaHaLoJeDi> ENORMOUS DISRESPECT
[4:02:11] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Seems more like deception
[4:02:12] <Scharfster> LUL
[4:02:12] <JoeNeutrino> Wow. It does nothing.
[4:02:12] <+TintainiumCan> If you want to go for a gimmick wind build, use the dragonbone weapons or the storm curved sword
[4:02:13] <Bouldus> welp that was a bit sad
[4:02:13] <axelcezar> boring invader
[4:02:14] <fireking900> Pat you're just too huge
[4:02:22] <+aversal_ammar> Too huge
[4:02:24] <PetrenkoBR> He is literally using one of the worst weapons in the game, give him a break
[4:02:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Nope it was a gimmick.
[4:02:28] <IronEncore> Ah oscar the plucky young adventurer
[4:02:28] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> storm ruler sucks major ass for anything but yhorm
[4:02:29] <T_Sasquatch> i thought that was an npc LUL
[4:02:32] <+alphonseisbest> that was just sad
[4:02:34] <Grandma_Amari> Storm Ruler was a great troll weapon in DeS but the DaS3 variant is scuffed.
[4:02:34] <Jontman42> They're dreg people
[4:02:40] <Inebriateddonut> They're called murkmen and that's all I know
[4:02:40] <reiju_22> heartless
[4:02:43] <Bouldus> i like to imagine all of the enemies are players that quit :P
[4:02:44] <DuoScratch> They're literally Human Dregs Pat.
[4:02:47] <%anticrust> Intense Disrespect from pat on that phantom
[4:02:48] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat they're all pygmies that have given themselves to the power of the dark soul
[4:02:50] <+JayEarly> “that tickled!”
[4:02:51] <rosemon5001> they are the magic users from all of the series
[4:02:52] <%foreverN2dust> at least with stormruler in DeS you had guaranteed knock back
[4:02:53] <KaijuBBQ> lmao heartless
[4:02:53] <thepowerofpinsol> What is a dreg
[4:02:54] <+terry_quest> pew pew angels
[4:02:54] <majindusto> THE DARKNESS
[4:02:56] <nepwar> him trying to use storm ruler is like woolie arguing about the gameboy Kappa
[4:02:56] <MegboyManuel> basically garbage
[4:02:57] <CheekyBirb> like,storm ruler says its the bane of giants, but it doesn't even work on regular giants
[4:02:59] <fireking900> LAZER ANGELS
[4:03:03] <+BunkusFreskie> storm damage can't hurt pat because hes the opposite of a dragon
[4:03:04] <@SSaryn> Storm Ruler is the epitome of a cutscene weapon that they just give you to for luls
[4:03:05] <Skeletonmanners> angles
[4:03:05] <+ZazaruGaru> can b ur angle or ur devil
[4:03:07] <Inebriateddonut> These angels aren't even scary anymore
[4:03:09] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat so the angel was nerfed
[4:03:09] <MegboyManuel> Pat, what about work???
[4:03:13] <Kaweta> Tetsuya Nomura?!
[4:03:15] <%SolitudeOtM> I wish they didnt nerf the Angel's
[4:03:19] <Videogamer4> TIME FOR THE BRO TEAM
[4:03:19] <+queuecumber555> I bought DS3 for my buddy when it was on sale and I’m still trying to get him to play it
[4:03:19] <+BunkusFreskie> opposite of a giant*
[4:03:21] <+Jack8274> F
[4:03:23] <+masked_hero_lucky> *A Cruel Angel's Thesis plays in the distance*
[4:03:32] <stevenschmee> They're the dregs of Battleborn's player base. Kappa
[4:03:35] <TyrantBelial> These guys got hard nerfed
[4:03:37] <MegboyManuel> Pat go to work dammit
[4:03:39] <Grandma_Amari> lol
[4:03:42] <TyrantBelial> remember when thse guys gatling guned youy forever?
[4:03:42] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the Ringed City is what happens when a genocidal god locks a power he fears away and keeps it there for too long. It festers and mutates and goes out of control and you get this.
[4:03:44] <stigna1> Man, the audio design on those angels is great. Its sound that conveys the idea of "cold" and "alien."
[4:03:45] <ovan20> @SolitudeOtM the casuals need to finish the game.
[4:03:47] <dc_8100> remember when those angels were actually menacing with their missles?
[4:03:49] <@SSaryn> Wow they really did nerf them
[4:03:51] <%foreverN2dust> @stevenschmee what is battleborn?
[4:03:55] <Bouldus> i actually love that weapon
[4:03:59] <availablethor> A bit too nerfed I'd say.
[4:04:00] <IronEncore> !work at risk!
[4:04:02] <%crot45> hi ssaryn
[4:04:03] <MegboyManuel> Woolie and mat are waiting for you!
[4:04:06] <nepwar> wish they didnt nerf the angles
[4:04:09] <@SSaryn> That angel beam is like half the damage
[4:04:10] <Bouldus> using a banner as a weapon is so neat imo
[4:04:13] <Kaweta> It's no Channelers dance but it's pretty cool
[4:04:13] <ConLin_Plays> Pat!!! Work!!!
[4:04:14] <arfsm95> @stevenschmee that''s impossible, there are too many dregs for the battleborn player base
[4:04:17] <+terry_quest> the angels where only diffciult until you figure out the gimmick
[4:04:22] <T_Sasquatch> its funny because i swear lawbreakers did worse than battleborn
[4:04:24] <MegboyManuel> Why does this make you happen, work?
[4:04:25] <Inebriateddonut> I'm glad I played through Ringed city before the nerf
[4:04:26] <%SolitudeOtM> Your Best Friends are waiting for you Pat!
[4:04:45] <arfsm95> @SSaryn yeah, half the damage, half the firing rate
[4:04:50] <+bonzosan> what if donte swoops into the dreg heap

[4:05:20] <%SolitudeOtM> those things are dead Puss of Man creatures
[4:05:30] <%foreverN2dust> He doesn't even work yet, he was gonna get lunch.
[4:05:33] <stevenschmee> At least Battleborn didn't end up being a Brothers In Arms Co-op arcade shooter like they originally planned.
[4:05:33] <DuoScratch> @AngriestPat roll for hidden passage
[4:05:33] <DaHaLoJeDi> @bonzosan "HEY CHOSEN UNDEAD, YOU CAN CALL ME DONTE THE UNDEAD KILLER, HAS A NICE RING TO IT DON'TCHA THINK?"
