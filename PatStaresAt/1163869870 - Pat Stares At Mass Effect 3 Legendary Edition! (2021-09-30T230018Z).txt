[0:00:30] <%jtdobyns> yeyeye
[0:00:47] <%Treuan> Lets gooo
[0:00:48] <%InternetShis> Aight chat, what have we got today
[0:00:48] <%king_wragles> Why does my connection always drop at the start?
[0:00:51] <cpt_langosta> big spider
[0:00:53] <FleshFriend> davekaHoo1 davekaHoo2
[0:00:55] <%jtdobyns> Totally forgot where we last left off?
[0:00:55] <%InternetShis> Horizon?
[0:00:56] <FleshFriend> davekaHoo3 davekaHoo4
[0:01:01] <%JamesCorck> Cheer500 Hey Pat, here's a stupid dumb idea. Imagine if, instead of having Kai Leng, we had a cyborg-clone-husk-thing of either Kaidan or Ashley (whoever was left behind on Virmire). It's dumb, it's the dumbest thing ever, but it'd connect with your Shepard better, go with the theme or forcing your allies against you, and still be better than what we got with Kai Leng. Besides, this would give you the chance to shoot Ashley in the face.
[0:01:04] <%jtdobyns> It has been a while
[0:01:09] <%InternetShis> We just did Thessia
[0:01:19] <%king_wragles> @JamesCorck no that's way better
[0:01:28] <%jtdobyns> did we chat with everyone yet?
[0:01:36] <%InternetShis> BioWare hire this man
[0:01:39] <DianaTheAscian> Space
[0:01:40] <%king_wragles> I forget
[0:01:44] <%jtdobyns> About how amazing KAI-LANG is?
[0:01:45] <%ape_hawk> no
[0:01:51] <%king_wragles> I remember we went to space
[0:01:54] <%JamesCorck> @king_wragles Heheh, basically what Wolfenstein The New Order did.
[0:01:54] <%king_wragles> Shot some guns
[0:02:04] <%king_wragles> and all the Batarians died.. I think
[0:02:07] <%king_wragles> or most at least
[0:02:14] <%JamesCorck> We talked to everyone, and checked Kai Leng's cringe email.
[0:02:18] <%hewlettfan96> Hopefully he can be done and dusted with these eventually
[0:02:21] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> YEEEEEEYEEEEE
[0:02:28] <%JoshManVGH> Holy fuck guys Midnight Mass is a TRIP!
[0:02:34] <%jtdobyns> I wonder how much Main Game is left before all the DLCs
[0:02:39] <%JamesCorck> I think today we're doing Leviathan.
[0:02:46] <%JamesCorck> And next stream should be Citadel.
[0:02:53] <%JamesCorck> And then one more stream for the EndGame.
[0:02:53] <godila2> @jtdobyns one mission before point of no return
[0:03:00] <%jtdobyns> So is Citadel like LAST LAST
[0:03:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Am I losing it or is the music slightly faster than normal?
[0:03:12] <%JamesCorck> Citadel is Second to last.
[0:03:13] <%jtdobyns> right before no point
[0:03:20] <%cactus_gato> is Pat beating it today? i forget how much he has left
[0:03:22] <%JamesCorck> The music is slightly faster than usual.
[0:03:32] <%InternetShis> Earth is gonna be a whole stream
[0:03:40] <emMmDeeKay> @cactus_gato Has he done the dlc yet?
[0:03:43] <%JamesCorck> I'm glad someone else said it @ReallyBigRocks because I thought I was losing my mind here.
[0:03:51] <%jtdobyns> I think the way he goes maybe 3/4 total streams left of this
[0:03:57] <emMmDeeKay> I'm only here for the shitshow that is the ending
[0:03:59] <%JamesCorck> He has two DLC's left to do @emMmDeeKay
[0:04:14] <%JamesCorck> I say 3 streams, if we're still on Baby Mode.
[0:04:18] <%jtdobyns> Citadel is like 1.5 streams worth of content
[0:04:19] <%cactus_gato> i hope he does Earth and Citadel DLC in one
[0:04:23] <%JamesCorck> If he turns the game back to Hardcore, 4 streams.
[0:04:24] <cpt_langosta> animuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[0:04:28] <emMmDeeKay> @JamesCorck alright, just leave this playing in the background in the meantime

[0:22:12] <%crassletter> use headphones
[0:22:12] <%Bluwizard21> Ballgag or earplugs
[0:22:13] <T_Sasquatch> It's totally fine
[0:22:14] <RayCSmooth> Yeah but I had snoo snoo
[0:22:15] <%InternetShis> And then she turns into Arin Hanson
[0:22:15] <+aBlueWizard> that would require me to get them to orgrasm
[0:22:15] <cpt_langosta> easy: never let them cum
[0:22:16] <superchunk121> Arin Hanson is epic so yea
[0:22:16] <%Dakuu75> they make ball-gags
[0:22:20] <%jillyrancher> Oh God every climax is Egoraptor complaining

[0:22:26] <%RealThiele> turns out im into you wearing a ballgag babe
[0:22:26] <%hewlettfan96> Breathlysing your balls
[0:22:28] <%Monkeyweed21> a sponge and some tape

[0:29:32] <%DashXero> Why is Pat not allowed to own firearms?
[0:29:33] <%ThomasOfTroy> Wait, why? You can get a gun license in Canada
[0:29:33] <%JamesCorck> Pat you already have the guns, give a flex lol
[0:29:36] <+cubbywolf> guess we'll just have to have safe schools
[0:29:38] <%king_wragles> Can't you own a gun if you own a farm in Canada?
[0:29:41] <%Profmcstevie> small man can't have guns, the recoil would make him fall

[0:30:00] <%Archphronimos> WTF you can't own a gun if you have OCD in Canada?
[0:30:01] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig PP = NO GUN
[0:30:01] <DianaTheAscian> Paige is 30% gun
[0:30:01] <%ThomasOfTroy> Does OCD automatically disqualify you from owning in Canada?
[0:30:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> no need to compensate

[0:30:04] <%Mekhet09> You can't have a gun if you have OCD?

[0:30:07] <%hewlettfan96> Anti-Ginger firearms
[0:30:10] <olaksi> "just give paige a gun no question asked" one of the stronger anti-gun arguments heard in a while
[0:30:11] <%Mattais88> "The gun you'd need to compensate for this penins is too small to exist"
[0:30:13] <%mads_valentine> Pat has to shoot 5 bullets at a time else the OCD kicks in.
[0:30:13] <%jackelzxaa> if pat owned a gun he would try to increase it's number and hurt himself
[0:30:13] <DusK_The_Stray> If your penis is too big you can't get a gun because it wouldn't be fair.
[0:30:13] <mr_saturday93> Two? you mean the one huge one in his pants?

[0:32:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt I can LITERALLY walk into Walmart to buy a gun and walk out with it the same day Also, fun fact, black powder guns are sold in clamshell packaging like toys because they're legally not a gun
[0:32:20] <i_chevalier> crazy

[0:37:46] <%bevyrage> the villain's entire deal is he's a hacker who is also a hardcore gamer in VR

[0:38:00] <%hewlettfan96> Nice singers
[0:38:01] <mr_saturday93> Sounds cooler than Kai Leng

[0:38:11] <tanarath> WOW. That'd be super dumb and great.
[0:38:12] <digaogrunge> How about CyberJacob?
[0:38:16] <%ThomasOfTroy> An evil robocop version of Ashley/Kaidan would be WAY better
[0:38:16] <T_Sasquatch> Wait .... Whoever got left behind would be dust
[0:38:17] <%RealThiele> Kai "Pussy" Leng
[0:38:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> T-100 Ashley

[0:38:27] <%JamesCorck> CyberJacob runs on Vista.
[0:38:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> Then  people would piss and moan about how they were nuked and its forced drama and blah blah blah

[0:44:46] <%jillyrancher> @monkeyweed21 Dont remind me lol
[0:44:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT REALLY?
[0:44:57] <%UvBenServed> Can you punch sticky grenades?
[0:44:59] <%Profmcstevie> Halo will never be Halo, but maybe new Halo will be good in it's own style
[0:45:00] <peachy996> the blue janitor suits? no
[0:45:01] <%RealThiele> they are okish
[0:45:05] <@MistyMntns> They are okay
[0:45:07] <$Futurecity10> yeah that guys a dumbass
[0:45:07] <%jillyrancher> Halo Infinite sounds nice
[0:45:10] <@MistyMntns> TNG outfits are best
[0:45:12] <@Ranryu692> easily the worst ones
[0:45:17] <tanarath> Paige, go to the optometrist
[0:45:19] <ThatGuyThere03> I love how everybody wants to talk about Halo but it just bounces off Pat super hard
[0:45:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> I weirdly  prefer Discovery's uniforms.
[0:45:21] <%RealThiele> One uniform guy
[0:45:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm exited for Halo because I like me some Halo
[0:45:31] <@MistyMntns> Discovery's uniforms are great
[0:45:35] <%jillyrancher> as a non star trek fan the OG and TNG ones are snazzy
[0:45:38] <%topendbuzza> uhhhh
[0:45:39] <Treasure_Vault> I love how bad Enterprise is. I would watch any ENT episode over nearly any TNG episode.
[0:45:41] <@Ranryu692> Late TNG/early DS9 uniforms are the best
[0:45:45] <Archmortal> agree with Pat that they are space overalls, and agree with Paige that they're fucking terrible
[0:45:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> I HATE THE DENTIST HOLY BALLS.
[0:46:01] <%ThomasOfTroy> The enterprise uniforms aren't great looking, but they honestly fit the tone and era pretty well imo
[0:46:04] <%Profmcstevie> I had 2 teeth taken under local anaesthetic that probaaably didn't work till 20 minutes after they yanked em
[0:46:04] <cpt_langosta> *sounds of rampant offscreen farting*
[0:46:06] <%RealThiele> yeah that redhead pain gene is mostly a negative
[0:46:07] <peachy996> I like the Voyager suits
[0:46:08] <orphancrippler_> Jon halo will do a halo in the next halo......halo
[0:46:22] <%PocketBearIllustrator> just started watching TNG Season 3. season 2 was mostly painful to watch
[0:46:27] <%jtdobyns> Gief doesnt wat you to suffer through another Kai Leng
[0:46:33] <arkv01> I like how voyager never got the memo for updated uniforms
[0:46:34] <%MichaelDood> Does the peanut butter in the toy trick still work?
[0:46:55] <%RealThiele> no
[0:46:56] <luftraumm1> i guess the best es some truth to the common joke that dentists are sadists
[0:46:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> WAIT WHAT
[0:46:58] <%jillyrancher> Hey which Star Trek series had the captain and someone else turn into lizards and mate via weord reverse evolution?
[0:46:59] <ThatGuyThere03> One thing that does strike me as strange is the MP and Campaign being separate in Infinite
[0:46:59] <orphancrippler_> MORE

[0:47:17] <Laecerelius> Voyager had the lizard transformation
[0:47:18] <%mads_valentine> ONLY THROW
[0:47:19] <peachy996> @jillyrancher the best Star Trek ever. Voyager
[0:47:21] <ThatGuyThere03> kinda makes me wary about whether or not they actually learned why 5 was so poorly recieved

[0:54:30] <Laecerelius> I watched Vinny play the demo for UnMetal.  It seems pretty good.
[0:54:34] <Jetsfantasy> Unmetal is a Metal Gear parody type game the demo was great
[0:54:36] <%jillyrancher> lemme be a Salarian

[0:54:47] <%Profmcstevie> Strong parody, funny
[0:54:49] <%RealThiele> the Jesse fox game?

[0:59:26] <%castlerock42> SMGs are great backups.
[0:59:28] <BigFingerRo> sorry , forgor
[0:59:36] <d3ltuhhh> I think thessia has still left its mark on pat
[0:59:52] <oda_flobunaga> think we are getting Citadel tonight?
[0:59:53] <Moffin23> was Thessia the most recent thing?
[0:59:53] <RyuuAoi> @bigfingerro No! I am faggit
[0:59:53] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat Put Gief back in his pokeball
[1:00:00] <%RealThiele> Kai leng fight is a low point, one of meny to come in the ME3 endgame
[1:00:00] <%jillyrancher> Thessia finale is one of the worst moments in the series
[1:00:01] <+farrellcityking> Put the dog in a burlap and feed it to Elmo. Done and done
[1:00:07] <@Ranryu692> @oda_flobunaga gotta do Leviathan first
[1:00:10] <%jillyrancher> @oda_flobunaga Nah next stream probably
[1:00:20] <+farrellcityking> sack*
[1:00:24] <oda_flobunaga> Leviathan is good too
[1:00:26] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan can be a bit long
[1:00:27] <%professionalwitchburner> Kei "It's Not A Phase" Leng
[1:00:28] <%DrTomT18> so what have I missed? I was playing Outer Wilds
[1:00:28] <Blank9> citadel is such a high point you need it to wash the taste out of your mouth
[1:00:30] <%Profmcstevie> It's time to forget all the controls to this game he hasn't played in a bit
[1:00:36] <cpt_langosta> Okay, honest question, of those here who have played the ME3 DLCs, is Leviathan better than Omega at least?
[1:00:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I guess Pat really doesn't want to play the game. Does that mean that Kai Lang won??
[1:00:43] <%castlerock42> Fuck, I forgot about Thessia. Shit is draining. Glad we're past it.
[1:00:43] <Moffin23> I remember really liking Leviathan
[1:00:45] <%jillyrancher> probably Horizon and Leviathan this straam
[1:00:49] <wolfen091> omega is bad
[1:00:49] <%hewlettfan96> Why is Pat so fat
[1:00:50] <Blank9> leviathan is absolutely better than omega
[1:00:54] <%DrTomT18> @cpt_langosta Miles better
[1:00:55] <%jillyrancher> @cpt_langosta Absolutely no fucking question
[1:00:59] <+LittleCinders> coxSoup
[1:01:00] <oda_flobunaga> Order of DLCs, Citadel, Lev, Omega
[1:01:07] <cpt_langosta> great!
[1:01:10] <%jillyrancher> like that's comparing a cookie to moldy bread lol
[1:01:18] <%professionalwitchburner> @cpt_langosta Leviathan is LAUGHABLY better than Omega
[1:01:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Leviathan is second only to Citadel
[1:01:19] <Moffin23> oh man, I never actually bought Omega back in the day
[1:01:21] <%hewlettfan96> Is it worth playing the RE Remasters
[1:01:23] <%Profmcstevie> A bitchin cookie at that
[1:01:28] <Moffin23> got Levi, then Citadel
[1:01:30] <%jtdobyns> I think ship/chat wiht everyone then off to Horizon? Then Levi
[1:01:36] <Moffin23> forgot that omega stuff even existed

[1:01:39] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan has interesting combat sequences and a fun spooky mystery
[1:01:47] <%DrTomT18> so he finished the Quarian part?
[1:01:47] <%baka_sugoi> WE NEED TO DEFEAT KAI LANG
[1:01:51] <%jtdobyns> He did all the omega stuff
[1:01:54] <%jillyrancher> like parts of Leviathan are fucking creeeepy
[1:01:56] <%castlerock42> Did you win the fight, Pat?

[1:14:13] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Kai Leng looks like a bootleg knock off of a Metal Gear cyborg
[1:14:18] <%DrTomT18> reject Asari, embrace Quarian
[1:14:19] <%komradedog> this is excellent news thank you for the good news
[1:14:20] <%jillyrancher> Garrys
[1:14:20] <%InternetShis> Chakwas has strong opinions
[1:14:24] <%bahookery> oh yay
[1:14:34] <%bahookery> good ol Gary Vakary
[1:14:38] <peachy996> you know what's also tight but okay, Garrus?
[1:14:41] <cpt_langosta> "it was tight, shepard... just like my ass. Wanna help me calibrate?"
[1:15:01] <%JamesCorck> They basically did an Operation Dynamo.
[1:15:03] <+Toshatron> did 3 ever explain why the human Reaper?
[1:15:07] <%DrTomT18> But I'm willing to risk it. For tits.
[1:15:13] <%JamesCorck> It's similar to what happened on Dunkirk in WWII.
[1:15:24] <%cooldude69xx> Aw geez Shep, Kai Leng really beat you up, huh?
[1:15:30] <oda_flobunaga> 9/11 times a million
[1:15:32] <cpt_langosta> "I've seen this before" says man facing galactic apocalypse
[1:15:36] <%bahookery> proximity mine is great
[1:15:37] <@Ranryu692> and you unlocked one of the worst abilities in the med bay
[1:15:45] <%tinytinykittycat> I've seen the end of the galaxy before
[1:15:47] <%DrTomT18> @Toshatron They were building a second Sovereign to take the Citidel with. I don't think it's ever explained, but it seems the most logical conclusion
[1:15:47] <%DashXero> Ah, she'll be fine.
[1:15:52] <rytisone> ruh roh
[1:15:53] <%NopeBadguy> hoo boi
[1:15:55] <+unhuggable1> uh oh

[1:16:01] <%Logoth_> ruh roh
[1:16:01] <%ScreamLord> @Toshatron Something about "preserving" humanity as a Reaper and they're probably gonna do that with all of advanced races
[1:16:03] <peachy996> Nah I'm sure Javik is comforting her
[1:16:03] <TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[1:16:05] <%MidnightBurst12> og
[1:16:06] <%ThomasOfTroy> @Toshatron It's somewhere in the design notes, but basically the primary species of each cycle gets turn into a reaper and then shoved in a shell that looks like the reapers we see
[1:16:07] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[1:16:07] <%castlerock42> Crew fight! Yeah!
[1:16:08] <%cooldude69xx> Ask her if she wants to talk to Joker.
[1:16:09] <%sporeian94> The line Garrus says about dictators being a neccesary evil in that convo has really stuck with me all these years because I kinda agree in a fucked up way
[1:16:09] <%jillyrancher> trouble
[1:16:10] <Laecerelius> Hey, the Prothean beacon showed him their galactic apocalypse so it kinda isn't the first time he's seen it
[1:16:13] <%InternetShis> She's doing okay

[1:16:33] <blackjack8182> Javik is right about everything!
[1:16:38] <Teras_ode> I bet this conversation is going to make so much sense since Pat missed all the lore in the mission
[1:16:41] <peachy996> YEAH GLOAT
[1:16:44] <%NopeBadguy> YOU WANNA SAY THAT EVEN CLOSER TO THE MIC?
[1:16:45] <%DrTomT18> no, be a dick

[1:17:34] <%tinytinykittycat> Javik is the best liar I love him
[1:17:35] <tanarath> It might have stunted them
[1:17:37] <Laecerelius> As long as one asari is around you can repopulate with the help of other species
[1:17:39] <%Logoth_> perfect dog timing
[1:17:42] <RickyRelucent> [angry baby noises]
[1:17:46] <@Spydurman> Javik is so up his own ass for having loss
[1:17:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> Lul
[1:17:47] <%snow_bush> NOPE
[1:17:48] <%ScreamLord> He's blowing smoke up her ass
[1:17:48] <%Dakuu75> FUCK THIS GUY
[1:17:48] <%DrTomT18> @Toshatron No, all the Protheans were turned into collectors, it seems
[1:17:49] <KingSpunf> Never trust a woman to do a Frog's work
[1:17:50] <%DashXero> I like this guy.
[1:17:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lmao Javik LUL LUL LUL VoteYea psaUp
[1:17:52] <thewrathofscience> GIEF TIMED THAT ERFECTLY
[1:17:52] <%sporeian94> Pat makes sure you go back and talk to Liara in her room
[1:17:52] <Sp3ctre48> Maybe your people should have told everyone about the beacon you were hording Liara Keepo
[1:17:53] <%castlerock42> Solid undercut, Javik.
[1:17:53] <@ssjklyco> Javiks' got balls calling out other races when his race failed hard.
[1:17:53] <spuginky> N O
[1:17:53] <godila2> LUL
[1:17:54] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[1:17:55] <peachy996> Perfect response
[1:17:56] <%dekkitout> Not false
[1:17:57] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> And then they banged
[1:17:57] <%InternetShis> Based
[1:17:58] <BrOOnoh> dlc btw
[1:18:01] <Teras_ode> carry on LUL
[1:18:01] <Visorak6> I dunno sincerity is a virtue
[1:18:04] <%DrTomT18> Javik is totally in the right
[1:18:04] <%snow_bush> I love Javik
[1:18:06] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Remember if the Asari immediately shared the beacon as soon as the invasion started things might have not gotten this bad. asari suck.
[1:18:19] <%bahookery> what is Javik's accent actually
[1:18:20] <%InternetShis> Day One DLC btw
[1:18:20] <+RJay80> when i did this cutscene liara glitched out and when she left she went through the wall
[1:18:29] <%dekkitout> Where's the lie
[1:18:32] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I thought Gief was sleeping, Pat? What happened to your win?
[1:18:34] <%jillyrancher> @bahookery African
[1:18:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> seems like an african accent
[1:18:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Javik is right the Asari 100% wasted their headstart ignoring the reapers
[1:18:42] <@Ranryu692> I feel like Javik should sound slightly different when talking to Liara/the other aliens from when he's talking to you, as he speaks English to you, and with the others you're hearing him through the translator
[1:18:42] <peachy996> Yeah
[1:18:42] <%cooldude69xx> @ssjklyco They fought off the reapers for centuries, and the Reapers had the citadel back then. Protheans did thousands of times better than we are
[1:18:43] <%Rumbutt> That's really a Men in Black line, not Star Wars
[1:18:43] <%DrTomT18> @jillyrancher Also they passed laws to punish anyone who hid prothean tech
[1:18:45] <%DashXero> That would have helped too.
[1:18:45] <%NopeBadguy> to be fair NO ONE BELIEVED YOU ANYWAY
[1:18:47] <TheQuadrupleS> No
[1:18:50] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:18:51] <Sp3ctre48> "Don't wanna"
[1:18:52] <tanarath> Y E A H, how about doing that? {}
[1:18:53] <%polothegreatest> tatooine isreal LUL
[1:18:54] <%InternetShis> But muh religion
[1:18:57] <+cermo55> hoarding knowledge = bad
[1:18:57] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt No, Space Lesbian supremacy
[1:18:58] <%Dakuu75> psaDogchamp
[1:18:59] <%jillyrancher> That too
[1:18:59] <Teras_ode> "but we space elves know better"
[1:18:59] <%Profmcstevie> They wanted an upper hand against society, bitches
[1:19:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> cant say where is africa
[1:19:04] <%Logoth_> if they're so smart how come they're dead?
[1:19:07] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt You know the reapers would have to put back all the renewable like there's no way this would ever be sustainable.
[1:19:12] <%sporeian94> She didn't know, it was that secret
[1:19:17] <%DrTomT18> Asari are gonna be the villains in the next game, I'm calling it
[1:19:25] <%jillyrancher> What a cunt lol
[1:19:25] <%TheAdMerlin> Asari is just the word for Arrogant in Galatic common
[1:19:26] <RickyRelucent> tusken raiders when the sandunes start shouting about privelage and oil:
[1:19:29] <%sporeian94> like maybe a dozen asari knew about the reapers probably
[1:19:33] <%Profmcstevie> Blue is never true, purple is where it's at
[1:19:34] <Teras_ode> robo gief? PogChamp
[1:19:36] <%InternetShis> Cause Asari are superior and humans thinking they know better is bad for galactic stability
[1:19:36] <%jillyrancher> my corpse better be on top the pile
[1:19:36] <Moffin23> they can't comprehend a galaxy where Quarians or even Volus are on the same level as them
[1:19:39] <MidnightPacif1c> The Asari have shareholders Pat, think of the shareholders
[1:19:40] <Archmortal> Remember the Asari Councilor going "we've ignored Shepard before and it didn't go well" and they STILL wouldn't help stop the Reapers
[1:19:40] <Sp3ctre48> tbf they couldn't access the actual VI but hiding that thing literally could've doomed them all
[1:19:41] <%bread_assassin> What was the gap between the Asari finding the Citadel and the Salarians, because the Salarians did that ALL on their own?
[1:19:41] <%Mekhet09> I meant nonrenewable resources
[1:19:44] <blackjack8182> Cool it Gief
[1:19:49] <%castlerock42> Well, yeah, Pat. People not doing even the bare minimum to help Shepard is like the main running theme in this series.
[1:19:50] <@Ranryu692> that's a good sniper
[1:19:55] <Visorak6> Better watch your money pat you're down to 90 million
[1:19:58] <cpt_langosta> pat is a geth plasma shotgun
[1:19:58] <d3ltuhhh> wait where did he get all that money
[1:20:01] <%cooldude69xx> James knows what bad writing feels like too
[1:20:03] <%sporeian94> He does know, you gotta watch The Anime Paragon Lost
[1:20:05] <tanarath> Pat, remember when Liara bemoaned how people are actually dying on Thesia & it made her out as a sociopath?
[1:20:09] <cpt_langosta> now pat is an m-98 widow
[1:20:11] <%ScreamLord> Wait, holy shit how'd pat get that much money?!
[1:20:13] <%kewlmyc> "I'm sorry Kai Leng kicked your ass."
[1:20:13] <Blank9> he does know, go watch his anime
[1:20:13] <+cermo55> most r aliens
[1:20:17] <Sp3ctre48> I know what it feels like to get owned by a epic and badass space ninja Shepard
[1:20:22] <SaltyAzteca> HOW COULD YOU LOSE TO KAI LENG SHEPAT.
[1:20:23] <peachy996> Yeah man so some sick cyber ninja who's the coolest ever kicked your ass... you're still human

[1:21:17] <Archmortal> @jillyrancher that's a whole Asari problem.  Remember how racist and classist the Citadel virtual intelligence guide is?
[1:21:27] <%jillyrancher> Oh hey also visit Dekunna and return to Elcor on Citadel! @patstaresat
[1:21:29] <+GTCknight> A lot of people pay for a night with Pat Shepherd

[1:22:52] <%Faustgesicht> How convenient the Asari write the law about hoarding Prothean Knowledge
[1:22:53] <%cooldude69xx> At least five Liara
[1:22:54] <%professionalwitchburner> Don't make promises you can't keep, bitch
[1:23:01] <%RealThiele> see Asari rules are meant to bind the lessers, not Asari jeez

[1:23:28] <%InternetShis> SHEPARD IS POSTING CRINGE
[1:23:29] <%DashXero> Dozens of colony worlds and they can mate with pretty much anything.
[1:23:33] <Blank9> the turians probably got it worse from the krogans
[1:23:36] <fetelgeuse> She just shouldered him out of whatever he was doing.
[1:23:36] <ghosrevan> she wants it shepard

[1:25:49] <%jillyrancher> SHEPARD IM A REAPER DOOMSDAY DEVICE
[1:25:55] <%DrTomT18> He wants to play Pat
[1:25:59] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:25:59] <%JamesCorck> He's the Best.
[1:26:00] <%DrTomT18> why are you so mean to him
[1:26:04] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat the all too perfect created for the sex species were actually in universe all too perfect created to the sex by the forerunner race
[1:26:04] <cpt_langosta> wrong organism bring back previous organism
[1:26:06] <Archmortal> but for real though how fucking stupid is the Asari leadership that even in the face of their own imminent extinction they're more worried about making sure no one else gets a beacon
[1:26:18] <%CTMathiu> aw puppa
[1:26:19] <Laecerelius> I really want ME4 to be a new character, hopefully allowing you to be an alien but that's highly unlikely
[1:26:22] <%shurtal> twouble
[1:26:22] <%DrTomT18> "I think I will cause problems on purpose."
[1:26:23] <tanarath> Trouble = play
[1:26:25] <%Monkeyweed21> he want attention
[1:26:28] <Ner234> Gief always chooses violence
[1:26:29] <tanarath> He's bored
[1:26:30] <peachy996> Ontarom right?
[1:26:31] <%JamesCorck> Pat you still on Baby Mode?
[1:26:31] <%ape_hawk> communicate on dis dick
[1:26:33] <BoneofMalkav> @jillyrancher "Get on the ship as soon as possible. We'll bang, ok?" LUL
[1:26:34] <%cooldude69xx> I bet the Yahg wouldn't hoard tech
[1:26:35] <+Twistedoldham> Twistedoldham subscribed with Prime. 
[1:26:36] <peachy996> Desert Map
[1:26:37] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Make sure to return to the Citadel Elcor for heartbreaks!
[1:26:37] <%Monkeyweed21> its an N7 mission
[1:26:44] <%professionalwitchburner> N7 missions a.k.a MP practice
[1:26:47] <d3ltuhhh> Gief has declared violence
[1:26:50] <%DrTomT18> is that thing in the DMZ there now?
[1:26:51] <%jillyrancher> dekunna
[1:26:51] <%sporeian94> I would advise doing the leviathan before Horizon then the citadel DLC immediately after, is that the way the guide has it
[1:26:51] <Blank9> asari are all inherently evil because they brainwash every race to view them as attractive
[1:26:59] <+allups> whyd thy adda s little ship it looks kinda silly
[1:27:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Probbing uranus
[1:27:28] <%akscully> an asari ship named sybian?
[1:27:29] <%DrTomT18> check out the OTHER systems
[1:27:31] <%sporeian94> Without the dlc this game would literally be over in 2 hours
[1:27:33] <+mel0dica> damn it i wanted fuel
[1:27:47] <%DrTomT18> Citidel is like 4 hours
[1:27:57] <%professionalwitchburner> Can't wait for ME4 to make the perfect Destroy ending canon so all those Control/Synth babies can cry
[1:28:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The suitable mode for Pat
[1:28:02] <%jillyrancher> Last N7 Mission btw
[1:28:03] <%ape_hawk> pat, have you been following all the hilarious new world shenanigans?
[1:28:04] <%TheAdMerlin> And now Pat has the best sniper in the game for Garrus
[1:28:05] <%thedankestmeeme> but asari's.. are attractive
[1:28:05] <rytisone> it takes a ral man to play in baby mode
[1:28:08] <%InternetShis> GOOD
[1:28:15] <%DrTomT18> I can't wait for none of the endings to be canon
[1:28:19] <peachy996> Chakram Launcher is weird
[1:28:23] <%professionalwitchburner> CHAKRAM
[1:28:24] <peachy996> I don't like it
[1:28:28] <%rkbinder> harrier
[1:28:28] <%DrTomT18> Pat, try the Geth Plasma Shotgun!
[1:28:29] <%JamesCorck> Are you doing the start of the Mentos tune?
[1:28:29] <%castlerock42> It felt like a lot of bullets.
[1:28:31] <peachy996> So use it
[1:28:33] <%jillyrancher> Revenant is LMG
[1:28:38] <SummonerMagno> Pat's dad will resent him for enjoying the game in easy mode
[1:28:38] <Teras_ode> does it even matter on baby mode?
[1:28:39] <%jackelzxaa> Whats pats galactic number at?
[1:28:40] <Moffin23> I know when I was deep in the multiplayer I was always a fan of the Graal spikethrower, that an option here?
[1:28:40] <%Monkeyweed21> use the chackram launcher for fun
[1:28:41] <ghosrevan> you ever think that gief could beat the reapers singlehandly
[1:28:42] <+MrBaldachin> the geth shotgun is good
[1:28:42] <%InternetShis> Do Chakram for the hell of it
[1:28:43] <%professionalwitchburner> N7 HURRICANE BRRR
[1:28:44] <%brisk_dacat> Playing Thumb sucker elite mode.
[1:28:45] <%AmuserName> PARTICLE RIFLE is a fun beam weapon.
[1:28:53] <%jackelzxaa> Is it almost dlc funtimes
[1:28:54] <Laecerelius> It's a chonker!
[1:28:58] <oda_flobunaga> Asari are to Attractiveness what Kittens are to Cuteness
[1:29:04] <peachy996> Yeah but who cares you're a big space baby now
[1:29:04] <%xcompleasedad> Pat, it is the BEST
[1:29:05] <%jackelzxaa> Or is that after the next mission
[1:29:15] <%jackelzxaa> Normal in me1: veteran
[1:29:34] <%jackelzxaa> Use the adas antimatter
[1:29:35] <%Mekhet09> So once the reapers destroy and harvest everything. How do they put back the resources necessary for a world to become technological enough to survive? If you get rid of all the iron deposits and aluminum how the fuck are they going to advance far enough?
[1:29:38] <%jillyrancher> Garrus achieves GODHOOD
[1:29:41] <Brandon__Brando> oh ya dont forget fuck that dad
[1:29:41] <%jackelzxaa> Adas antimatter is busted
[1:29:44] <%professionalwitchburner> OH IT'S THAT MULTIPLAYER MAP
[1:29:48] <%Logoth_> Ms. Sato, why do you have PS2 hair
[1:29:56] <haisho> oh hey it's the map you always get in MP
[1:30:02] <Zombrocom> The reapers don't harvest the planets resources, just the people
[1:30:04] <peachy996> I like this MP Map. But only when it's clear and sunny
[1:30:11] <%jackelzxaa> I missed abunch of eps has pat tried every gun
[1:30:12] <peachy996> Fuck the Dust Storm version

[1:30:35] <@Ranryu692> that's some horror movie shit right there

[1:30:41] <SaltyAzteca> Multiplayer map!!
[1:30:42] <%jackelzxaa> Tiny baby mode for normies
[1:30:43] <Forbidden_Karp> Ah right this place
[1:30:43] <%dekkitout> He ia a dog shaped baby
[1:30:44] <%castlerock42> @Mekhet09 They don't touch developing races, so I presume they just get off their worlds and find poor planets to use.
[1:30:45] <lloyddboy> i loved this map in mp
[1:30:45] <%RealThiele> Ni. . . San
[1:30:48] <Virokwet> he only one year, he babay

[1:30:52] <%DashXero> I'm starting to understand that policy mentioned earlier.
[1:30:54] <+MrBaldachin> yeah all the jank that things had in ME2 is gone, all the old guns just feel and work better
[1:30:56] <tanarath> @zombrocom construction in space is cheaper than on-planet

[1:31:59] <%polothegreatest> yeah, i believe it
[1:32:05] <%baka_sugoi> too many vidya gams
[1:32:06] <%Monkeyweed21> He resented his kid for having a better life than he did

[1:32:13] <%jackelzxaa> Fuck yeah brand helmet
[1:32:16] <%Mekhet09> I'd call my own kid a scrub.
[1:32:17] <%cooldude69xx> @strakillias It's an action game tho
[1:32:20] <peachy996> Also you were under the assumption baby mode would get you throught this game faster and it was not the case
[1:32:22] <%Mekhet09> It builds character.
[1:32:24] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Please charge it up. It's really good
[1:32:26] <%Puhff> BOOP
[1:32:28] <Brandon__Brando> i dont mind the baby mode i just want to see the story at this point
[1:32:30] <%castlerock42> Pat missed five times in a row and that's great.
[1:32:30] <Laecerelius> "I hate my child because I gave him a better life than I had"
[1:32:32] <KnivesEve> .... yeah
[1:32:34] <%DrTomT18> It makes me so happy when Pat listens to my suggestions!
[1:32:41] <%Logoth_> Ninja Gaiden's Infinite respawning enemies builds character
[1:32:45] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat you can charge it for more damage
[1:32:47] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget the Corporate dystopia!
[1:32:48] <JetpackMcQuack> but zangief doesn't care about global crises
[1:32:52] <SaltyAzteca> OH NOOOO
[1:32:52] <%Profmcstevie> But sadly, probably real for some
[1:32:55] <%Rumbutt> Our kids can have easy mode on games, because they'll have Hell or Hell in real life
[1:32:57] <%Logoth_> Have your child play Destrega
[1:33:01] <stormhawk9891> yeeeaahhhh
[1:33:02] <%Mekhet09> What the fuck is evil zone?
[1:33:02] <%rkbinder> he will have a less bad life?
[1:33:05] <+hatok> can't play Evil Zone if you're on fire
[1:33:06] <@ssjklyco> Playing with my cousins kid and friends kid, much like dogs they love playing fetch
[1:33:07] <%cooldude69xx> Didn't you die three times the first stream you did Narrative difficulty?
[1:33:08] <rytisone> Misato?
[1:33:09] <Blank9> my children will never grow up without the internet
[1:33:10] <Virokwet> misato
[1:33:14] <Midnight188> yknow it'd be funny if kai leng shows up again only to get murked by a reaper beam
[1:33:15] <%Puhff> hopefully you're already sterile
[1:33:16] <willsin4fun> I played twisted metal as a kid then it told me I cant beat the game unless I got gud
[1:33:17] <%jillyrancher> He did
[1:33:18] <%RealThiele> Grandkids get waterworld or madmax
[1:33:22] <%DrTomT18> Pat, what do you know about the Levithan DLC?
[1:33:25] <%jillyrancher> Misato
[1:33:28] <%jackelzxaa> I wish mass effect 3 had a higher difficulty.  Insanity is just too easy for me
[1:33:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> she dead
[1:33:43] <%professionalwitchburner> She ded now
[1:33:44] <%DashXero> Isn't there a whole planet's worth of of broken promises in Shepard's wake?

[1:34:07] <%cooldude69xx> @jackelzxaa After ME 2's idea of high difficulty, I'm fine with ME 3 insanity
[1:34:07] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the BEST multiplayer map

[1:34:46] <SaltyAzteca> Now you have to spend money on it, oh noooo
[1:34:50] <%jackelzxaa> Me2 on hardcore is harder than me3 insanity, but also i think me2 hardcore is the barrier of fair @cooldude69xx
[1:34:50] <%castlerock42> You wanna try that sentence again, Pat?
[1:34:51] <Brandon__Brando> wow that was a filler mission
[1:34:54] <+MrBaldachin> I keep thinking they're saying "Misato"
[1:34:58] <%jillyrancher> I don't think so
[1:35:05] <%DrTomT18> yes
[1:35:06] <%sporeian94> yeah with the dlc

[1:35:14] <oda_flobunaga> No way you can't
[1:35:14] <%ape_hawk> nah, you should quit the game now

[1:47:24] <%Dakuu75> okie-dokie-smokey
[1:47:27] <Moffin23> if that is the hill they want to die on I guess?
[1:47:31] <%castlerock42> Just walk away from the double down.
[1:47:33] <+coldsama> This is the only reason I follow Scrubquotes, but it never happens

[1:48:14] <%professionalwitchburner> It gets EVEN WORSE
[1:48:16] <+vaderxyz1970> So did the Reapers come from one direction or were they just spread out equal distant from the center of the galaxy?

[1:50:51] <ghosrevan> why?
[1:50:53] <SaltyAzteca> Graciously, thank you human
[1:50:56] <Brandon__Brando> The reapers dont feel that scary on this
[1:50:56] <%DrTomT18> I think something has appeared in the DMZ
[1:50:58] <%jillyrancher> That should be it for the fetch quest shit.
[1:51:01] <Sp3ctre48> Bioware won't let you kiss Elcors BibleThump
[1:51:01] <%tinytinykittycat> is it a mouth?
[1:51:03] <@Ranryu692> Badassfully:
[1:51:03] <peachy996> Uncomfortable, Please stop that Human
[1:51:04] <%watts121> @Dakuu75 cuz it's not Blitzball without hardcore al bhed racism.
[1:51:06] <%Faustgesicht> Wish Elcor were like a call-in in MP
[1:51:07] <%Monkeyweed21> I wish we saw what elcor warriors look like
[1:51:07] <%WeLucklessJacks> Elcor are hot.
[1:51:09] <Moffin23> they are the guys who are like if HK was a big nerd elephant right?
[1:51:11] <Laecerelius> Seductively:  Draw me like one of your French girls.
[1:51:13] <%RealThiele> Badassfully: ok
[1:51:13] <%ape_hawk> they'd be like: Erotically, that's my genitals
[1:51:16] <%StaceMcGate> time to bully the reapers?
[1:51:17] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Elcors are for hugs
[1:51:18] <%dekkitout> How do elcor eat? Are they grazing folk? Do they filter feed? Lore nerds, tell me
[1:51:20] <d3ltuhhh> @Moffin23 yes
[1:51:21] <%DrTomT18> you didn't, you glossed over the Hour Glass Nebula
[1:51:24] <cpt_langosta> Displeased: Your signs of affection arouse something in me and it makes me uncomfortable.
[1:51:27] <ExpressNode> Embussy
[1:51:30] <%Dakuu75> @watts121 lol
[1:51:30] <+cermo55> Your going to love Citadel DLC
[1:51:43] <%Faustgesicht> oh no he broke his neck
[1:51:48] <peachy996> Look at the floor
[1:51:51] <%jillyrancher> I think instead of Rachni, Ravagers should've been huskified Elcor.
[1:51:56] <%akscully> :(
[1:51:58] <peachy996> everybody do the kakliosaur
[1:51:58] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[1:51:58] <%PlumpPotatoRump> LOL
[1:51:59] <%watts121> So I just finished Bozja today finally. I heard they weren't continuing the storyline...but it ends on a massive cliffhanger?
[1:52:00] <alrobot2014> how do elcor reproduce?
[1:52:00] <%UvBenServed> BibleThump
[1:52:01] <lloyddboy> BibleThump
[1:52:01] <kingra> BibleThump
[1:52:01] <%sporeian94> dude that's like the equivalent of sobbing in elcor
[1:52:02] <+squeejiro> :(
[1:52:05] <%IronOhki> I was trying to describe an elcor to a friend. I called them llama sized pachyderms.
[1:52:05] <Laecerelius> That's a bashful elcor
[1:52:06] <%InternetShis> :(
[1:52:07] <+Ropcord> FeelsBadMan
[1:52:08] <%professionalwitchburner> Mischievously: That was the wrong number
[1:52:10] <ghosrevan> sad
[1:52:11] <+cermo55> yup
[1:52:12] <%tinytinykittycat> sadest part in the game
[1:52:14] <%DrTomT18> talk to that Asari!
[1:52:14] <Moffin23> just too sad
[1:52:17] <%akscully> don't need to with that statement
[1:52:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Probably too long to say
[1:52:19] <cpt_langosta> sorrow so immense it comes through without preface
[1:52:20] <%critikal_bit> Yup
[1:52:20] <d3ltuhhh> @jillyrancher there's concept art for reaper elcor, they're actually pretty cool
[1:52:20] <%castlerock42> He didn't need to.
[1:52:21] <%sporeian94> he literally is so sad, he's like unctrollably sobbing in human terms
[1:52:22] <kingra> Too sad :(
[1:52:24] <%IronOhki> HK-Fourty-Elcor
[1:52:26] <%Solid_Stro> I don‚Äôt think he needed to
[1:52:27] <+cermo55> because they didn't need to
[1:52:29] <%DrTomT18> oops, sorry
[1:52:31] <%senfood> That was the most emotional elcor I've ever heard and it was sadness for his people...
[1:52:32] <%JamesCorck> Can't even muster the energy to use the pheromones to express emotion.
[1:52:34] <%professionalwitchburner> Emotional state: Not good..not good, human
[1:52:35] <%dekkitout> Or- did the translator have no appropriate word to preface?
[1:52:35] <KingSpunf> maybe he'son the spectrum?
[1:52:37] <oda_flobunaga> You do realize that the more we tell him he's going to love the Citadel DLC the more he's going to go out of his way to hate on it out of spite right?
[1:52:40] <AluxStreams> the translator didn't even bother
[1:52:40] <%DrTomT18> my b
[1:52:45] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt how would you rate this game so far?
[1:52:53] <%jillyrancher> Like he wants to scream but isnt able to do it
[1:53:00] <%JamesCorck> Yeah that's fair.
[1:53:03] <peachy996> Nah he'll hate the Citadel DLC for other reasons that I know he will
[1:53:06] <secret_npc> Hey chat, where are we so far?
[1:53:06] <%Mekhet09> It was a 5/10 for me.
[1:53:07] <%DrTomT18> Citidel makes it like, an 8
[1:53:08] <Moffin23> the Kai leng parts
[1:53:09] <%castlerock42> How would you rate it before Thessia?
[1:53:09] <@ssjklyco> So a KOTOR 2
[1:53:11] <peachy996> Or he'll like it. Hard to say
[1:53:11] <%JamesCorck> The bad parts are teeeerrible, yeah.
[1:53:13] <oda_flobunaga> Highest highest hiest of the series paired with the lowest lows
[1:53:13] <%robotoken> sounds about right
[1:53:13] <%IronOhki> I heard there's a cereal assassin.
[1:53:17] <Zombrocom> Yeah that's about right
[1:53:18] <%DrTomT18> no, Hour Glass
[1:53:20] <%senfood> Kai Leng dropped it by a full point alone.
[1:53:20] <%tinytinykittycat> How would you rate the others?
[1:53:25] <blackjack8182> Accurate
[1:53:26] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt Alright, what would you have given it BEFORE Thessia?
[1:53:27] <%afronooch> @secret_npc right at the start of act 3
[1:53:28] <%RealThiele> 6.9/10 for Kai "Pussy" Leng
[1:53:29] <@Ranryu692> Hourglass
[1:53:29] <%DrTomT18> HOUR GLASS
[1:53:31] <%jtdobyns> Wouldn't Special Eyes make it an 8
[1:53:31] <%sporeian94> pretty sure lkepler and nubian have awssets
[1:53:32] <%akscully> downmap
[1:53:32] <+thecosmicfly> Do the Kai Leng parts hold up?
[1:53:33] <@Ranryu692> but I think it's an empty one
[1:53:34] <%afronooch> horizon is next
[1:53:34] <%JamesCorck> Bottom of the map.
[1:53:35] <$dalmek> wasn't it Hour Glass?
[1:53:35] <secret_npc> Bottom left
[1:53:36] <cpt_langosta> horsehead can wait, can't it?
[1:53:37] <+vaderxyz1970> How fucked up would it be if an Elco being the most depreast it has everbeen produced the most valuable perfume in the galaxy
[1:53:37] <@Spydurman> it's a 8/10 and a 2/10 that make it a 6/10 instead of 10/10
[1:53:40] <GameOver_Here> Bottom right
[1:53:41] <secret_npc> Right*
[1:53:46] <%watts121> KOTOR 2 is weird in that it's ending is both amazing and terribad.
[1:53:47] <peachy996> It's under there
[1:53:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Hourglass Nebula
[1:53:48] <Zombrocom> I thought it was hourglass
[1:53:54] <%PlumpPotatoRump> U passed it, north west
[1:53:55] <oda_flobunaga> Kai the Lenghog
[1:53:57] <Laecerelius> hourglass is up top
[1:54:00] <%ShogunNoonto> top left
[1:54:01] <%DrTomT18> Is there anything in the Nubian?
[1:54:03] <%bahookery> is Leviathan next?
[1:54:08] <secret_npc> My mistake
[1:54:09] <%JamesCorck> Oh woops.
[1:54:09] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Thats right
[1:54:12] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:54:12] <%StaceMcGate> dig up...in space
[1:54:13] <%JamesCorck> Nevermind! lmao
[1:54:13] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt Be sure to check out Ninmah Cluster before you do anything else

[1:54:16] <$hattrick61> no th other bottom
[1:54:19] <Sp3ctre48> yaaay fuel
[1:54:19] <%tinytinykittycat> horsehead is towards the bottom
[1:54:21] <%SirGO0SE> our glass :)
[1:54:24] <%Mekhet09> horse head is bottom.
[1:54:26] <blackjack8182> Other bottom
[1:54:27] <%watts121> I will say, Mass Effect's naming of the clusters and stuff makes the Milky Way sound so damn cool.
[1:54:28] <cpt_langosta> LUL
[1:54:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD LUL
[1:54:36] <Laecerelius> Yay, money
[1:54:36] <peachy996> Ninmah bizniss
[1:54:39] <Sp3ctre48> I sure do love planet scanning quests
[1:54:45] <%watts121> Like what if you lived in the fucking "Shrike Abyssal"?
[1:54:49] <%bahookery> the planet descriptions in this game are great in this game btw
[1:54:51] <%JamesCorck> Horse Head is in the bottom? thats what I meant lol
[1:54:52] <%professionalwitchburner> Don't forget the Ligma Nebula
[1:55:00] <%RealThiele> eyeball nebula
[1:55:00] <%bahookery> check out the Vorcha and Batarian planets sometime
[1:55:07] <@Spydurman> and the Grabma Nebula
[1:55:07] <oda_flobunaga> What if there was a Moist Grundle Nebula or cluster
[1:55:10] <secret_npc> This is just a One Guy opinion, but I think you should play the Citadel DLC on Hardcore
[1:55:11] <Moffin23> idk if it was this game or in 2, but I recall there were sectors in Mass Effect named Baras and Malgus, and wasn't sure whether this or swtor came first
[1:55:13] <%Faustgesicht> Or the Finsta Nebula
[1:55:19] <%jillyrancher> I think Pat will like Citadel Regardless. it's so sincere with how much of a "we love you guys" to people who've stuck with this series from the beginning.
[1:55:19] <Laecerelius> The nebula is watching you, Pat
[1:55:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Is Queens voice just Edi?
[1:55:46] <peachy996> Oh yeah the Citadel DLC should be done on at least normal
[1:55:48] <%jillyrancher> the ending of Citadel made me unexpectedly emotional after so long of not playing this series.
[1:55:51] <d3ltuhhh> the SHADOW BROKER????
[1:55:52] <$dalmek> Shadow Joker
[1:56:01] <Ekaelis> Have you been watching Joel Haver animations recently Pat?
[1:56:03] <@Ranryu692> did you just call Liara a dog?
[1:56:08] <%watts121> Shadow Borker
[1:56:10] <%RealThiele> EDI isnt enough of a wine aunt to be Queen
[1:56:13] <oda_flobunaga> That's it, the Grundle Cluster!
[1:56:15] <lloyddboy> Shadow Jonker
[1:56:19] <%tinytinykittycat> I'd shadow her borker
[1:56:23] <+Ropcord> s o c i e t y
[1:56:24] <%jillyrancher> The guy behind the whole operation is Tony Lazudo
[1:56:26] <%PlumpPotatoRump> Shadow borker lol
[1:56:28] <cpt_langosta> how does one bork in the shadows, tho?
[1:56:29] <@Ranryu692> she's definitely a bitch LUL
[1:56:36] <%jillyrancher> Toby Lazudo!?
[1:56:38] <@Spydurman> Shadow the Joker, finishes a race in one second by falling over
[1:56:40] <$dalmek> Shadow the Hedgehoker

[2:19:00] <+robotrippin> He exploded the husk head in the lab
[2:19:04] <secret_npc> Coming up to the first combat section, I believe, where the good shit starts
[2:19:07] <%PatNTheHat> PatNTheHat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 44 months woo. Only 1 more month until baby number 5
[2:19:08] <%JamesCorck> Need more caffeine Pat?
[2:19:13] <DatAsuna> I do forget which order the first 2 missions go in. lol
[2:19:13] <%Rumbutt> reapers with their huge space braps
[2:19:16] <%JamesCorck> Or is the game getting boring?
[2:19:17] <TioXyco> BRAAAAAAAAAAAAP
[2:19:27] <%jackelzxaa> The darkness must not be breached
[2:19:33] <%SinnerEbru> reapers respect the DLC boundary
[2:19:35] <ghosrevan> i would take edi and javick
[2:19:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Reapers are huge fans of inception
[2:19:38] <SaltyAzteca> Population 152, huh
[2:19:39] <ghosrevan> nvm
[2:19:40] <%JamesCorck> Yawn yawn ;_;
[2:19:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "Signal confirmed, sending supplies"

[2:19:55] <%DrTomT18> do you plan staying up late again you silly boy
[2:19:56] <+ProfessorMorrigan> anyone wanna breach my darkness? üò≥
[2:20:00] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat you‚Äôre allowed to do this mission right as soon as you get edi recruited
[2:20:13] <Zombrocom> I thought people didn't like this one
[2:20:19] <DatAsuna> team dextro

[2:20:39] <DatAsuna> Opinions on this one are more mixed
[2:20:46] <DatAsuna> I like it but don't love it.
[2:20:49] <%SinnerEbru> dextro team best team
[2:20:51] <%jackelzxaa> SQUAD DIALOG in DLC
[2:20:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Dextro-gamers rise up!
[2:20:58] <SaltyAzteca> Omega's DLC was drab
[2:21:04] <DatAsuna> It definitely feels like a DLC level designwise. lol
[2:21:09] <d3ltuhhh> the two dextro chads
[2:21:14] <secret_npc> This is a good sequence
[2:21:14] <DatAsuna> However storywise it shoulda been main story
[2:21:18] <DSD24> Geth Plasma Shotgun the best
[2:21:22] <%xcompleasedad> @SaltyAzteca It's the bronze in a three man race
[2:21:24] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYYE

[2:21:48] <SaltyAzteca> @xcompleasedad Thats actually the best way to explain it
[2:21:49] <$realm_forge> PLAY IT FOR HALLOWEEN
[2:21:49] <%InternetShis> BRRRRRRT
[2:21:51] <+OneGorillionDollars> DO IT
[2:21:52] <TourettesPlays> is pat still on baby mode
[2:21:53] <+Khazra> Is anyone else slightly worried about the Deadspace 1 remake
[2:21:56] <cpt_langosta> narrative is the new normal
[2:21:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Melted
[2:21:57] <%SinnerEbru> jesus,
[2:21:59] <%jackelzxaa> between leviathan, extended cut, and citadel dlc it feels like the actual bioware writers did as much as they could to fix the ending mess and now we know they also didnt like the ending
[2:22:02] <TioXyco> ah, we playing on baby mode yet, I see
[2:22:03] <%jillyrancher> DEAD SPACE TRIOGY RUN
[2:22:04] <Moffin23> biotic charge solves all problems
[2:22:05] <+Ropcord> the whole flotilla part of 3 was great and then they dropped the ball from orbit onto a shitty ice planet
[2:22:05] <blackjack8182> Play dead space 2 on stream
[2:22:06] <digaogrunge> BABY MODE
[2:22:08] <peachy996> serious troops just sounds funny with this
[2:22:09] <Sp3ctre48> Hyper advanced machine gods can't open doors right smh
[2:22:15] <%InternetShis> Baby Mode Garrus is the Punisher
[2:22:15] <d3ltuhhh> oh he's still on narrative isn't he
[2:22:19] <peachy996> a pacifier in every orifice
[2:22:26] <%jackelzxaa> Extended cut is so appreciated
[2:22:27] <%DrTomT18> I would be cool to see Pat play all the Dead Space games
[2:22:27] <blackjack8182> BABY MODE
[2:22:27] <%JamesCorck> Getting lots of Boss Baby vibes out of this Narrative Mode.
[2:22:29] <%DrTomT18> all 2 of them.
[2:22:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Always Baby Mode so you feel like a Big Man!
[2:22:31] <DatAsuna> I actually played a few planets on the "no choices" mode and I was surprised that the default choice is usually renegade lmao
[2:22:32] <Moffin23> zambo time
[2:22:35] <+EmpyreanMAULER> EmpyreanMAULER subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:23:33] <SaltyAzteca> Hi how are ya :)
[2:23:34] <TioXyco> what's that expression on shepard's face? LUL
[2:23:45] <%InternetShis> They work in retail

[2:24:00] <%studleydoorite> a world without zinc D:
[2:24:04] <Shade075> like its obvious
[2:24:07] <TourettesPlays> Zinc > Tungsten
[2:24:10] <%DrTomT18> Tsungston is what you shoot out of your gun in these games
[2:24:11] <%Monkeyweed21> this is way creepier than indoctrination this is great
[2:24:12] <cpt_langosta> if this was a yakuza game, one of the dialogue options would've been to pursue the applications of tungsten
[2:24:16] <SaltyAzteca> LMAO
[2:24:16] <%Mr_Pylon> i love tungston
[2:24:17] <+vaderxyz1970> There is no war in Ba sin se
[2:24:17] <%tank7013> Why is Shepard such an idiot in this DLC? Like more than normal
[2:24:17] <DatAsuna> yeah this isn't indoctrination, this is just unpaid overtime :P
[2:24:19] <%DrTomT18> cause it hits really fucking hard
[2:24:20] <+RJay80> The is no war is Ba-sing-se
[2:24:23] <AngryAsian5> NOT SUS AT ALL
[2:24:24] <Teras_ode> :) it broke
[2:24:26] <SiameseSneeze> no shit
[2:24:26] <%jackelzxaa> Lol
[2:24:28] <%InternetShis> This isn't normal indoctrination
[2:24:29] <lloyddboy> YOU THINK TALI???
[2:24:32] <%WeLucklessJacks> Please tell me the applications of Tungsten.
[2:24:36] <peachy996> La Le liu le lo?
[2:24:37] <%SinnerEbru> NO SHIT TALI, THANKS
[2:24:40] <fetelgeuse> They're what? sounds fake.
[2:24:41] <%MidnightBurst12> rude
[2:24:41] <$realm_forge> This is still less creepy than your average DMV
[2:24:41] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[2:24:45] <%baka_sugoi> you no belong here
[2:24:49] <%DrTomT18> Indocturnated people don't chit chat with one another
[2:24:53] <TioXyco> DIE MONSTER! YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD!
[2:24:56] <alwayspronking> wait is that blood on the floor??
[2:24:57] <oda_flobunaga> Tungsten what? My ass?
[2:24:58] <%jillyrancher> indoctrinated people still talk like people lol
[2:24:59] <ExpressNode> This looks like the perfect section to start off the beginning of October
[2:25:00] <$hattrick61> What could possibly be wrong with these people i wonder?
[2:25:06] <+vaderxyz1970> Best tour ever
[2:25:09] <Thepothero> WE ARE THE MANY
[2:25:15] <%JamesCorck> Pat, keyword of this DLC is Insmouth.
[2:25:16] <%InternetShis> Tour over
[2:25:17] <%DrTomT18> @professionalwitchburner dude shut up
[2:25:22] <%jillyrancher> oh fuck they are the many
[2:25:31] <%jackelzxaa> This rules
[2:25:41] <%SinnerEbru> oh that guy is gone
[2:25:42] <%Profmcstevie> Guide....a drone? Alright
[2:25:52] <$realm_forge> This has Midwestern megachurch speed dating energy
[2:25:53] <SaltyAzteca> Alex GARNEAU
[2:25:59] <haisho> is this when MP got the stupid escort mission?
[2:26:11] <%DrTomT18> @realm_forge that is oddly specific
[2:26:12] <+RJay80> rooBlank do you need a doctor?
[2:26:23] <+vaderxyz1970> its Tungstung Pat
[2:26:23] <cpt_langosta> tali, i don't know if you know this, but lying is amazing and you should do it more
[2:26:23] <%walternatorz> lying is a lot of fun
[2:26:26] <%tank7013> Friendly rocks :)
[2:26:30] <jtsoppy137> Rocks yay
[2:26:31] <Retinolgaming> big tungsten at it again
[2:26:31] <%InternetShis> Ore what?
[2:26:31] <%terrible35> Tell me more about tungsten.
[2:26:34] <%Kiyosuki> I did really like the vibe of this dlc.
[2:26:42] <lloyddboy> the Normal Pills factory
[2:26:45] <Thepothero> @jillyrancher All that‚Äôs missing is xerxzes over the PA
[2:26:48] <DatAsuna> The escort mission is the easiest one, the really bad one is the hacking one because you basically can't solo it
[2:26:50] <+RJay80> rooBlank this is a normal zone here
[2:26:54] <%cylish> cylish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Ahh good just in time for some cosmic horror adjacent gameplay
[2:26:54] <Captain0Punz> looks like they all took their normal pills
[2:27:05] <%Archphronimos> something on the table with flowers
[2:27:05] <$hattrick61> Man these people are acting confused and delerious. almost like theyre being controlled. what could possibly be going on ?
[2:27:08] <Forbidden_Karp> everyone's having a normal one today
[2:27:09] <%SinnerEbru> the table was interactable
[2:27:18] <SaltyAzteca> :) everything is fine
[2:27:24] <%shootbang_exe> who put normal pills in the water supply
[2:27:31] <+vaderxyz1970> Where seeing about replacing Vitimin C with Vtimin T - Tunstung
[2:27:31] <%studleydoorite> these guys are so inconspicuous, total dead end
[2:27:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> how would Shepard not immediately know they're indoctrinated????
[2:27:37] <TioXyco> they doing things
[2:27:40] <Forbidden_Karp> super slidey walking animations
[2:27:44] <d3ltuhhh> the way he said interesting LUL
[2:27:55] <$dalmek> I hope it actually isn't indoctrination and they're just weird
[2:27:57] <%DrTomT18> Just a normal mining facility
[2:28:08] <cpt_langosta> prompt in hallway?
[2:28:09] <kikoeru_san> getting big Joo Dee energy from this place
[2:28:10] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! yay
[2:28:15] <QuestlordJake> tomatoConcern
[2:28:15] <%Faustgesicht> But they're not immediately violent at least
[2:28:16] <secret_npc> Hope the fatigue isn't setting in too much, Pat, this trilogy playthrough has been a fucking blast
[2:28:19] <%InternetShis> You just walked into the grocery store at 10:59 P.M. on a Friday
[2:28:19] <%Profmcstevie> Did we enter some mine wide D&D session or something
[2:28:22] <Shade075> Shep can tell that TIM is indoctrinated but these guys are A OK
[2:28:27] <kikoeru_san> everything is fine in Ba Sing Se
[2:28:29] <+squeejiro> atpNinja
[2:28:34] <+SmigGames> starting to feel like I don't belong :(
[2:28:36] <DatAsuna> the indoctrinated people he's met haven't been like this is why It's usually either subtle delusion or full crazy
[2:28:39] <%terrible35> big eye
[2:28:40] <%Kiyosuki> these guys are just vibin
[2:28:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @kikoeru_san lmaoooi
[2:28:44] <+dmbender> what part of the game is he at? I dont remember this at all :0
[2:28:53] <@Ranryu692> @dmbender Leviathan DLC
[2:28:55] <rytisone> "We dont take kindly of your folk around here"
[2:28:56] <%shootbang_exe> this is dlc
[2:28:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> leviathan dlc @dmbender
[2:29:01] <%ElkRiverDog> There is no war in Ba Sing Se
[2:29:03] <SaltyAzteca> lol
[2:29:04] <peachy996> This spooky theme reminds me of  Jacob's Loyalty mission
[2:29:04] <Ekaelis> @Shade075 This is too obvious, indoctrination appears more subtle than this
[2:29:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> CMON SHEP THIS AIN'T NORMAL
[2:29:05] <$hattrick61> you know what would be a sick swerve? if they set all this obvious indoctrination up and then it turns out they found an other thorian
[2:29:07] <Moffin23> did shepard already introduce himself, or do they already know who you are>
[2:29:07] <DatAsuna> These guys are acting like a hivemind is the part that should put shepard on edge
[2:29:10] <peachy996> but slowed down
[2:29:11] <jtsoppy137> I dont have that
[2:29:12] <+dmbender> ah okay thanks! For some reason I thought Leviathan was ME 2
[2:29:22] <%shootbang_exe> so anyway I started blasting
[2:29:23] <%JamesCorck> Us or the guys in the game?
[2:29:26] <tanarath> puzzle time in normalville
[2:29:29] <DatAsuna> Speaking of jacob, there is a mod to let guys slap jacob too
[2:29:30] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Doth thou bust upon thine stream?
[2:29:31] <+vaderxyz1970> Is this how pre reaper geth acted?
[2:29:34] <peachy996> In fact I think it is a slowed down version of Jacob's Loyalty Mission theme
[2:29:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is a drop of rain, to a storm?
[2:29:39] <%jillyrancher> The fact they arent just attacking Shepard also is odd
[2:29:42] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat jeff gerstmann and patrick kleppek were upset about how good the dlc for me3 was because they genuinely believed brad had a better experience playing it a year later and they wished they hadn‚Äôt had to play the launch version of the game
[2:29:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dmbender this is a follow up dlc to the Alpha Relay dlc in 2
[2:29:46] <lloyddboy> man this place gives me huge Boss Baby vibes
[2:29:48] <Zombrocom> Casually strolling through insmouth right now
[2:29:50] <%studleydoorite> the biggest giveaway is the ominous baritone horn blasting over the intercom
[2:29:58] <kikoeru_san> there is no reaper on the asteroid
[2:30:06] <%DrTomT18> what year is it?
[2:30:07] <%jillyrancher> if they're just indoctrinated they probably would be attacking you at this point.
[2:30:12] <DatAsuna> yeah that was how their goty arguement shook out
[2:30:19] <%jillyrancher> Shhh
[2:30:25] <kikoeru_san> it's the flowers or something
[2:30:31] <kikoeru_san> idk
[2:30:42] <SaltyAzteca> Stomach contents...what
[2:30:43] <jtsoppy137> i kinda forgot most of this part
[2:30:47] <DatAsuna> basically brad/vinny/alex didn't hate it as much cause they played with the DLC.
[2:30:59] <peachy996> Third time you enter a facility filled with mind controlled losers by the way
[2:30:59] <kikoeru_san> I never played this shit
[2:31:00] <%IronOhki> Just for you, Pat.
[2:31:00] <%Faustgesicht> ya'll bein' sus
[2:31:02] <cpt_langosta> why keep ignore big black computer?
[2:31:10] <%Archphronimos> are they just like, studying general biology here instead of mining?
[2:31:10] <DatAsuna> Though vinny was more understanding of Jeff/patricks's issues
[2:31:11] <+GTCknight> Welcome to the UAC
[2:31:13] <peachy996> Thorian in ME1, Arrival in ME2 and this
[2:31:24] <%JamesCorck> No it's not.
[2:31:25] <%DrTomT18> @PatStaresAt The year is 2186 in Mass Effect 3, just an FYI
[2:31:35] <%studleydoorite> no DLC or not no DLC
[2:31:36] <PinkSocks> 2012 was kind of a meh year
[2:31:37] <DSD24> Combat wise its better than the last two
[2:31:40] <%kujofire990> have i missed citadel yet?
[2:31:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:31:42] <peachy996> But you gotta choose between this or RE6
[2:31:43] <Retinolgaming> Nah it's not game of the year, but its not a bad game.
[2:31:45] <%tank7013> It feels like they're just cataloguing various knowledge about how anything organic works
[2:31:47] <%SinnerEbru> where's ME3 in the bioware continuum
[2:31:47] <%sporeian94> I'm trying to recall what other games came out the same year as ME3
[2:31:49] <DatAsuna> Well discussion but not winner. 2012 didn't have much else of note
[2:31:52] <jtsoppy137> its great.....but not thaaat good
[2:31:54] <%InternetShis> Hmmmm
[2:31:57] <secret_npc> It was kind of an alarming DLC to get after the fact
[2:31:57] <%jillyrancher> For 2012 maybe imo.
[2:31:57] <+cermo55> nope, LE edition didn't fix enough
[2:31:58] <%JamesCorck> ME3 doesn't hold a candle to Spec Ops: The Line, or Walking Dead.
[2:32:01] <%Daxalog> I thought this game wouldve ended its story 1-2 hours ago
[2:32:03] <blackjack8182> RE6 GOTY
[2:32:04] <cpt_langosta> left
[2:32:11] <d3ltuhhh> ME3, halo 4...that's all I can really remember
[2:32:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is this leviathan or another one i don't remember
[2:32:11] <%InternetShis> Citadel DLC GOTY whenever it came out
[2:32:15] <peachy996> What came out in 2012 besides this and RE6
[2:32:18] <cpt_langosta> damn
[2:32:20] <artoflec> giant bomb GOTY's were really rough for a while lol
[2:32:20] <%Monkeyweed21> in 2012 it was competing with like Dishonored, Walking Dead and GW2
[2:32:21] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Theres a door you missed
[2:32:26] <tanarath> You're missing a door somewhere
[2:32:29] <Zombrocom> Did you go into that other door in the hallway
[2:32:36] <+vaderxyz1970> It would sure be nice to have an AI that could hack any and everything be helpful right now
[2:32:43] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Back near Med
[2:32:49] <DatAsuna> GB's GotY 2012 was Xcom right? (As it shoulda been)
[2:32:55] <oda_flobunaga> Make like Woolie and hallwugg
[2:33:03] <artoflec> easyallies gave best narrative to 13 sentinels when they had a huge last of us 2 fan on the group so im happy for that
[2:33:04] <%Profmcstevie> 2012 had Hotline Miami, 2012 couldn't have been all that bad in gaming
[2:33:07] <robosqueeb> find dr garneau
[2:33:07] <%walternatorz> crew is connected to science quarters?
[2:33:10] <%jillyrancher> Xcom EU?
[2:33:13] <%sporeian94> Journey came out in 2012
[2:33:22] <%jillyrancher> Oh fuck yeah Hotlije Miami was 2012
[2:33:22] <secret_npc> Was Dragon's Dogma 2012 or 13?
[2:33:24] <%SirGO0SE> didnt dark souls come out in 2012 lol
[2:33:26] <%jackelzxaa> If me3 had been delayed to 2013 it could have been spectacular
[2:33:27] <+CyanDeadEye> Dead End
[2:33:31] <@Ranryu692> I really like ME3, but it isn't GOTY over Journey, TWD season 1, Hotline Miami, and Dragon's Dogma
[2:33:34] <%jillyrancher> Hotline Miami fucking rules
[2:33:34] <cpt_langosta> give a few high-fives to that door until it opens... that's how hacking works in the future
[2:33:34] <DatAsuna> dark souls was 2010
[2:33:35] <tanarath> big door missing
[2:33:41] <artoflec> yeah they really should have delayed this game
[2:33:42] <%jackelzxaa> Instead it came out RIGHT at the end of the fiscal year
[2:33:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bork
[2:33:51] <SaltyAzteca> Nice
[2:33:56] <secret_npc> Wait Dogma was 2012??
[2:33:57] <%jillyrancher> Enemy Unknown was really good too
[2:33:57] <artoflec> i dunno vanilla DD is kinda ass compared to Dark Arisen imo
[2:33:58] <@Ranryu692> @artoflec by like, 2 years
[2:33:58] <d3ltuhhh> ME3 deserved another year but EA just fucked bioware over
[2:33:59] <%SirGO0SE> ah way off then @DatAsuna
[2:34:06] <DatAsuna> I like dragon's dogma but it's too weird and japanese for a GB goty lol
[2:34:11] <%demiiluna> What's Pat doing now?
[2:34:12] <Zombrocom> Digging up a old one artifact in a mine and everyone goes crazy? That's just straight up a lovecraft story.
[2:34:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Its a wierd Marker shaped object that is red....
[2:34:21] <Zombrocom> Word for word
[2:34:21] <DatAsuna> I'm glad vinny and patrick played dogma tho
[2:34:32] <tanarath> @d3ltuhhh bioware chose not to take the extra year.
[2:34:35] <Moffin23> would love it if this just turned out to be an unrelated cult
[2:34:36] <robosqueeb> @vaderxyz1970 make us whole shepard
[2:34:40] <d3ltuhhh> wait WHAT
[2:34:43] <DatAsuna> Real talk: if Dragon's Dogma 2 ever happens, I want it to have death stranding style ladders/ropes and shit
[2:34:45] <%InternetShis> Tali beep boop
[2:34:50] <secret_npc> Yeah GB might not all like it, but Dragon's Dogma is easily the best from that year
[2:34:51] <%studleydoorite> bwaaahBWAAAHbwabwuhh
[2:34:51] <d3ltuhhh> @tanarath stop the cap
[2:35:09] <%jillyrancher> I really appreciate we get this walking around interacting thing. ME3 severely lacks quiet moments in missions imo
[2:35:15] <artoflec> i would hope in DD your characters would need ropes and ladders because your mage just makes you all levitate
[2:35:20] <secret_npc> @datasuna I'll back that up, sure
[2:35:22] <artoflec> wouldn't*
[2:35:26] <DatAsuna> DD is probably my favourite that year but it has way too many parts about it I totally understand people being turned off by
[2:35:32] <%DrTomT18> @jillyrancher Probably because the world is ending
[2:35:43] <%jackelzxaa> @artoflec Its kind of uncomfortable because giant bomb‚Äôs goty situation was a case where it was blatantly obvious that a single person (abby) was the problem
[2:35:45] <%jillyrancher> I need to finish Dragons Dogma
[2:35:57] <DatAsuna> I loved DD enough to play it on 4 platforms to lvl 200, but I can acknowledge it's many flaws and jankness.
[2:36:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> sam jilly
[2:36:05] <%DrTomT18> okay so this dude looks almost exactly like my Shepard and it freaks me the fuck out
[2:36:09] <DatAsuna> It's a love it or hate it game.
[2:36:22] <artoflec> @jackelzxaa yeah that year was probably the roughest one to listen to, and that was 2017 which was a banger
[2:36:25] <secret_npc> lol
[2:36:34] <%studleydoorite> are the special eyes gone for good?
[2:36:37] <%jillyrancher> Yeah I know why Tom. it just exhausting a bit from a gameplay standpoint to have every mission be "BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM"
[2:36:39] <secret_npc> HSWP
[2:36:44] <%SinnerEbru> homie turn on your cell light, the switch is by the door
[2:36:45] <artoflec> i really wish DD had multiple save files but they had an explanation for why that was so difficult
[2:36:46] <%StaceMcGate> his eyes are gone?
[2:36:49] <DatAsuna> 2014 was maybe the worst GoTY just in terms of nothing good coming out
[2:36:53] <%jackelzxaa> It was the nier automata year wasnt it? @artoflec
[2:36:58] <secret_npc> This is next level indoctrination
[2:37:00] <Teras_ode> "I'm fine"
[2:37:00] <DatAsuna> When shadow of mordoor is your GotY you know it's a bad year
[2:37:06] <%terrible35> I am fine :)
[2:37:15] <DSD24> Wasn't Dragon Age Inqusition the GOTY in 2014?
[2:37:23] <secret_npc> I am d o c t o r garneau
[2:37:36] <%jillyrancher> Wolfenstein The New Order was probably my favorite game from 2014.
[2:37:37] <SaltyAzteca> THE DANKNESS
[2:37:37] <tanarath> hmmmm, very monotone
[2:37:38] <cpt_langosta> do you believe in a thing called love?

[2:38:00] <SaltyAzteca> HIT HIM WITH THE BASS CANNON
[2:38:01] <+D00msDayDan> independence day, anyone?
[2:38:02] <%jackelzxaa> This rules
[2:38:05] <%DrTomT18> Gotta get a drink, don't do anything cool without me
[2:38:06] <%jackelzxaa> This RULES
[2:38:09] <%SinnerEbru> "you bring only death" is metal as fuck
[2:38:11] <$Shaggy2124> Sup pat
[2:38:14] <rytisone> chase sequence
[2:38:23] <%jackelzxaa> Fuck yeah eldrich mysteries
[2:38:25] <Brandon__Brando> hes not wrong shepherd has killed a fuck ton of people
[2:38:26] <TioXyco> why he sounds like Harbinger?
[2:38:27] <DatAsuna> @DSD24 Nah it was mordoor. Inquisition suffered in awards because most of them got hinterlands burnout. lmaoo
[2:38:28] <%jackelzxaa> Space eldrich
[2:38:31] <%InternetShis> Chase the Kingdom Hearts villain!
[2:38:40] <%Daxalog> So why is shepard and the crew immune to this mind control?
[2:38:47] <%jillyrancher> Tip: Get out of the Hinterlands
[2:38:49] <secret_npc> this is fine
[2:38:58] <Sp3ctre48> @Daxalog Cause they're the main characters
[2:38:59] <%InternetShis> Can't equip helmets mid ladder
[2:39:03] <+vaderxyz1970> @InternetShis The Darkness Sora!
[2:39:10] <DSD24> @DatAsuna Its always the Hinterlands that gets people
[2:39:10] <lloyddboy> BLIND
[2:39:14] <%jackelzxaa> Love garrus
[2:39:18] <DatAsuna> @Daxalog shepard's big protagonist dick protects him from the rules of the universe. This is kind of the universal flaw in the story
[2:39:21] <KnivesEve> you know who wouldnt have trouble with the darkness? Kai Leng
[2:39:26] <%jackelzxaa> Me3 garrus is the best garrus
[2:39:33] <CrypticMochi> Probably takes a long time or needs long term contact with certain stuff
[2:39:45] <@Ranryu692> at least you don't have to hide behind it anymore
[2:39:49] <%Axellogic> YEAH CHEST HIGH WALLS
[2:39:52] <tanarath> loading screens
[2:39:53] <%studleydoorite> if you really want someone to leave, "turn back" and "leave this place" just have an air of enticing mystery that invites further investigation, "get the fuck out" is what you want
[2:39:54] <blackjack8182> KAI LENG ISN‚ÄôT AFRAID OF THE DARKNESS LIKE SHEPARD IS!
[2:39:54] <+SmigGames> @Daxalog I think EDI will kind of address that
[2:39:57] <Moffin23> wait wasn't rise already on steam?
[2:39:59] <artoflec> yeah man and it comes out in JANUARY that's at least a month sooner than i thought
[2:39:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd be happy if there were anytihng to hunt
[2:39:59] <Laecerelius> I finally get to play it with my friends!
[2:40:00] <%Treuan> Happy to see a Ceanataur
[2:40:00] <DatAsuna> There is a good slide animation but I wonder if LE removed that too. lol
[2:40:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> YEAHHHH
[2:40:04] <DianaTheAscian> okay pat
[2:40:06] <Sp3ctre48> Man I really don't remember a single thing about this dlc besides the last part
[2:40:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> HUNTING HORN TIME!
[2:40:07] <%Profmcstevie> Rise with hi res textures.....thank lord
[2:40:11] <d3ltuhhh> indoctrination was always a slow process even in ME1 and 2
[2:40:12] <%InternetShis> Time for MODS
[2:40:13] <ExpressNode> I never bought it and I got my built my new rig so i can't wait to try it
[2:40:15] <blackjack8182> The cover mantle animation is terrible!
[2:40:15] <$lotharrio> Is this Leviathan?
[2:40:19] <PanicSwytch> Bandai Namco changed their logo in tgs just now
[2:40:21] <%jillyrancher> They did not remove the slide
[2:40:22] <secret_npc> Between that and the Bloomberg report, this must have been an annoying week for Nintendo
[2:40:26] <@Ranryu692> I really wish Nintendo would go the way of Sega and just stop making consoles entirely
[2:40:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Remember to tip your dooters
[2:40:32] <%Ynkubus_> we now gotta dates for it and the expansion we already knew it was coming to pc
[2:40:32] <%Daxalog> I think Rise will be my first Monster Hunter. I want to see if the Hunting Horn is as crazy as people say
[2:40:34] <%afronooch> as you should
[2:40:36] <+D00msDayDan> way ahead of you
[2:40:37] <%IronOhki> ...on the monsters.
[2:40:37] <%walternatorz> isn't your character a guy?
[2:40:37] <jtsoppy137> da biggist
[2:40:40] <%valriot> MH Rise Up Gamers
[2:40:40] <Brandon__Brando> pat how could you
[2:40:41] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Did you see that it has Denuvo
[2:40:42] <cpt_langosta> rathalos milkos
[2:40:43] <%InternetShis> YEAAAAH
[2:40:43] <ExpressNode> Make em hang low
[2:40:45] <%Axellogic> Monsters are intimidated by larger titties
[2:40:46] <Teras_ode> If the launch is anything like with the previous game, you might as well be playing it on a Switch for the first few montsh
[2:40:46] <Laecerelius> Give your cat and dog big fat tits just like Plague woulda done!
[2:40:48] <%shurtal> biggus titus
[2:40:52] <%Rumbutt> Mod your Monster Hunter so you look like Yagami from Lost Judgement
[2:40:55] <+vaderxyz1970> I want to make my dogo as big as Nigel
[2:40:56] <DatAsuna> There's leaks saying a 4k switch is in the works and I do not believe them even 1%
[2:41:00] <%IronOhki> Tiddies on the monsters, as Plauge intended.
[2:41:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat did you just miss that super easy shot
[2:41:03] <secret_npc> 1 Year Denuvo
[2:41:04] <Teras_ode> *months
[2:41:04] <%greasypete00> denuvo as a whole can suck my stinky balls
[2:41:06] <%demiiluna> How big do you need Rathian's tiddies to be, Pat?
[2:41:09] <%Profmcstevie> Nothing has Denuvo....for long
[2:41:09] <%InternetShis> FF7R on PC doesn't exist, so we have the next best thing
[2:41:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> I fucking hate denuvo
[2:41:17] <secret_npc> They remove after 12 months or so
[2:41:17] <%Mattais88> I like it as is on the switch
[2:41:18] <%professionalwitchburner> 4K Switch at 5FPS
[2:41:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> it doesn't even do its job
[2:41:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Forget that I want to replace my dogo with Nigel
[2:41:26] <%InternetShis> Not until it has some saltine crackers
[2:41:27] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt it'll prob be messed up at launch but thats expected
[2:41:28] <%mai_waifu_> Tons of stuff has Denuvo for long
[2:41:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck denuvo
[2:41:31] <Laecerelius> Time for an escort missioooooon!!
[2:41:36] <+CyanDeadEye> Its an MP mechanic put into story
[2:41:38] <jtsoppy137> protect lil robot
[2:41:40] <%JamesCorck> This is a multiplayer thing.
[2:41:44] <+D3dshotCalamity> Yay, escort mission!
[2:41:44] <%Faustgesicht> Multiplayer Mode demo
[2:41:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> ESCORT MISHION
[2:41:46] <%jackelzxaa> ESCORT
[2:41:48] <%JamesCorck> The multiplayer has a similar mechanic.
[2:41:48] <+NicheNova> Multiplayer mission
[2:41:48] <TioXyco> ESCORT the drone
[2:41:50] <%Profmcstevie> Seeing RE8s odd frame drops magically stop when Denuvo was taken out is hilarious
[2:41:51] <haisho> yes and it sucked in MP
[2:41:52] <Sp3ctre48> Wow they totally just put this in the MP LUL
[2:41:53] <$Shaggy2124> We need the drone, but it requires a gameplay mechanic to do the thing and whatever the mission
[2:41:55] <%IronOhki> I feel like I did this in Warframe a lot.
[2:41:58] <%Monkeyweed21> look at this multiplayer mechanic
[2:42:03] <%dekkitout> @DatAsuna Oh, you mean the leaks from last year? Or from the previous year to that? Or the other OTHER 4k switch leaks?
[2:42:05] <%jillyrancher> I really hope Metroid Dreas is good
[2:42:05] <DatAsuna> Yeah in MP it actually has a purpose but in SP it's just fluff.
[2:42:07] <%GhoulishCripple> has pat beaten the game or does this DLC happen first
[2:42:08] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> They pulled this mechanic out of the multiplayer.
[2:42:11] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat Hey pat how do you like this me3 multiplayer teaser?
[2:42:12] <rytisone> what is this, destiny?
[2:42:17] <%jillyrancher> YO SCARLET NEXUS IS ON GAMEPASS
[2:42:22] <%DrTomT18> and you have a kick ass gun
[2:42:23] <DatAsuna> The point of it in MP is to prevent you camping every round in 1 chokepoint
[2:42:24] <Laecerelius> Pat's doing DLC first
[2:42:25] <%IronOhki> Hey you like that quest in Destiny where you have to put the circle in the place? Or that other one where you get all the triangles?
[2:42:25] <%jillyrancher> been wanting to try that game
[2:42:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its not just a cort. its S CORT
[2:42:27] <+ProfessorMorrigan> pretend?
[2:42:28] <%walternatorz> Pretend?
[2:42:29] <$SGrim> @GhoulishCripple dlc first
[2:42:29] <secret_npc> @ghoulishcripple Sanctuary after this
[2:42:29] <+SmigGames> the reapers never expected baby mode
[2:42:31] <DatAsuna> But in SP there isn't waves
[2:42:34] <jtsoppy137> it sure is
[2:42:35] <%SinnerEbru> baby mode fucking rules
[2:42:39] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:42:40] <cpt_langosta> pat in diapers confirmed
[2:42:45] <+picante_papi> LUL
[2:42:50] <%IronOhki> Hard cut to all the times Pat calls himself a baby.
[2:42:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat Its so nice you let zangief play
[2:42:51] <%afronooch> im baby
[2:42:52] <Teras_ode> are you SURE?
[2:42:52] <%StaceMcGate> that's right, pat is a man-child, not man-baby
[2:42:54] <Sp3ctre48> The point of this in MP was forcing Vanguards to actually follow the rest of the team Keepo
[2:42:55] <+purplestufff> so what if i am
[2:42:55] <DatAsuna> These are ADULT daipers he's wearing
[2:42:56] <%professionalwitchburner> The Reapers never expected NARRATIVE
[2:42:56] <%knight1210> we're all are
[2:43:00] <%Monkeyweed21> you talk about it alot tbf
[2:43:00] <+D3dshotCalamity> Peepee poopoo Pat
[2:43:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats why you put on baby mode right?
[2:43:08] <secret_npc> Pat doesn't wear the romper on stream
[2:43:10] <%Profmcstevie> Who would be mistaken for a baby here, us or you
[2:43:10] <lloyddboy> PAT
[2:43:12] <Moffin23> friendly fire

[2:43:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Shaggy2124 they are not human thus not people
[2:43:49] <%professionalwitchburner> Harbringer is mad at Shepard for not playing at the difficulty that he wants him to play on
[2:43:50] <DatAsuna> cutscene pistol lol
[2:43:50] <%jillyrancher> Paige please bring me my tit I'm hungry.
[2:43:52] <secret_npc> Does Paige have the front to carry you when you go out?

[2:47:16] <%jackelzxaa> BOOM!
[2:47:17] <%augusm> What does the Asari care? They live 1000 Years
[2:47:18] <+SmigGames> don't listen to chat
[2:47:19] <secret_npc> Someone in chat really liked that 10 year drop lol
[2:47:19] <%machshop> yes probably
[2:47:20] <%Profmcstevie> Cos chat fucking dumb, shocker
[2:47:20] <ghosrevan> the salarians must be tramutized
[2:47:21] <$hattrick61> yes
[2:47:24] <natzo89> guys thought they were smart
[2:47:24] <%InternetShis> Yes
[2:47:26] <AngryAsian5> Chat pulled a dumb dumb
[2:47:30] <Moffin23> it is actually gonna tell you important stuff, don't have to remember stupid stuff
[2:47:31] <%bread_assassin> These people have A LOT of catching up to do.
[2:47:34] <%DrTomT18> yeah for the Asari that's like one week of work missed
[2:47:34] <oda_flobunaga> EMOTE TIME?
[2:47:34] <DatAsuna> we need more power
[2:47:35] <KnivesEve> did chat do a dumb?
[2:47:38] <fetelgeuse> The game assumed the player was as braindead as Shepard.
[2:47:39] <+vaderxyz1970> 1 munute here is 1 year out there
[2:47:39] <%Mattais88> Were they 15 when they started that project?
[2:47:40] <natzo89> salvar√≠an must be dead at this point
[2:47:41] <%studleydoorite> Pepega
[2:47:48] <%studleydoorite> this is why you need Pepega enabled
[2:47:48] <%tank7013> Chat always eager to be the cool hero that gave the streamer the big revelation
[2:47:53] <%Saadi90> The chat in these Mass Effect streams are big dumb dumb
[2:47:58] <SaltyAzteca> UL
[2:48:00] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:48:02] <%professionalwitchburner> We need MORE POWER
[2:48:06] <%ArchimerCXV> chat? pat can't miss something the game funnels you into a cutscene for
[2:48:11] <d3ltuhhh> yeah salarians would probably be either close to dying of age or already dead
[2:48:16] <Zombrocom> Maybe there was some
[2:48:17] <%jillyrancher> Imagine waking up from like, a dizzy spell, and somebody tells you 10 years have passed. That's creepy af.
[2:48:21] <+purplestufff> citadel? hardly know adele!
[2:48:26] <SaltyAzteca> reapers really did fuck off
[2:48:32] <cpt_langosta> guess that big reaper presence at the station was just a fluke. no reapers here anymore.
[2:48:40] <peachy996> why?
[2:48:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Yea if they were over 30 they would be dead
[2:48:41] <DSD24> and No More Heroes
[2:48:42] <%studleydoorite> @jillyrancher 10 years closer to true freedom :)
[2:48:46] <+vaderxyz1970> agreed
[2:48:47] <%afronooch> fair
[2:48:47] <%JamesCorck> Fair.
[2:48:48] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt what'd you think of the Outer Wilds DLC?
[2:48:49] <%JamesCorck> Dude. Fair.
[2:48:50] <%DrTomT18> Well you have been playing sense March
[2:48:50] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Fair
[2:48:50] <secret_npc> Take a break
[2:48:50] <%shootbang_exe> yeah that's fair
[2:48:51] <%jackelzxaa> @patstaresat check for ship dialogue
[2:48:51] <+aBlueWizard> luckily you're close to beind done
[2:48:51] <bear_breaker20> feel bad for mass effect 3 cause its mass effect 3
[2:48:51] <Sp3ctre48> BibleThump
[2:48:51] <DianaTheAscian> Yeah
[2:48:53] <secret_npc> fuck it
[2:48:53] <+BigCoffee> just finish it in 2 sittings
[2:48:54] <Laecerelius> That's what binging all three games will do
[2:48:54] <peachy996> the good part about ME3 has been over for weeks
[2:48:55] <%JamesCorck> You've done the whole trilogy. Holyshit.
[2:48:56] <%shootbang_exe> me3 felt really undercooked
[2:48:56] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Gloom_Tangerine subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey Pat, It's been 11 months subbed, but more importantly, it's been a year since your stream of Yakuza that was in my neurosurgery! I'm still cancer free. Thanks again for all you do!
[2:48:56] <rytisone> so Andromeda right after, right?
[2:48:57] <%Profmcstevie> All the momentum is gone
[2:48:58] <%AncelDeLambert> you SHOULD be burnt the hell out, you mainlined these things
[2:48:58] <%thedankestmeeme> you and me both brother
[2:49:01] <%Faustgesicht> Three game marathons, bro
[2:49:01] <%DrTomT18> yeeaaah booi
[2:49:02] <%JamesCorck> About time to put it to rest.
[2:49:02] <%machshop> it has been like 4 months
[2:49:03] <SaltyAzteca> Is it burnout, or the inevitable end?
[2:49:05] <$hattrick61> theres only 1 stream worth of game left after todayu
[2:49:05] <Retinolgaming> Yeah we can tell LUL you've cancelled it 6 times
[2:49:06] <Zombrocom> You did decide to play the entire trilogy in a row
[2:49:11] <%SovPho> it's a crazy dlc
[2:49:14] <%augusm> 10 years for the Asari is 1 year equivalent for a human. It sucks but they are getting off easy compared to the humans.
[2:49:14] <@Ranryu692> @hattrick61 that is not true lol
[2:49:14] <secret_npc> Take a break from ME3, Pat
[2:49:15] <%DrTomT18> I thought you might play it tonight
[2:49:18] <d3ltuhhh> it all peaked at rannoch
[2:49:21] <%jillyrancher> You played literally all 3 games in a row
[2:49:22] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt gonna play alan wake?
[2:49:24] <%afronooch> There's  ton more than one stream chat
[2:49:27] <+NicheNova> Go back to it next year, it's the 10 year anniversary
[2:49:31] <Sp3ctre48> You could just rush through the rest of the missions instead of doing the side shit, you have the war assets at this point
[2:49:31] <%machshop> eliminate it
[2:49:35] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt With the amount of hype you've been getting for Citadel, it will probably suck in comparison to your expectations
[2:49:36] <%polothegreatest> this baby mode will make you complete games faster. thats a plus
[2:49:38] <%jillyrancher> Dont take a break you literally have like 2 or 3 streams left.
[2:49:39] <Laecerelius> Pat's orb is evil!  It can control minds!
[2:49:42] <%studleydoorite> robutt shot
[2:49:55] <secret_npc> If I watch too much of a TV show in one sitting, I eventually get numb to everything happening
[2:49:58] <DatAsuna> I still say doing the ending after leviathan and leaving citadel completely seperate is the way to go
[2:50:00] <%DrTomT18> it's a big orb thingy
[2:50:03] <%DrTomT18> WHAT DOES IT MEAN
[2:50:09] <@Ranryu692> @DatAsuna it's really not
[2:50:18] <d3ltuhhh> leviathan's ORB
[2:50:20] <DatAsuna> It was the last ME3 content released and it works best as an endcap
[2:50:29] <secret_npc> Why spoil the stream if you get fatigued? No point if we're not all enjoying ourselves
[2:50:33] <Forbidden_Karp> head's back!
[2:50:34] <SaltyAzteca> Oh the head is back
[2:50:35] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna Sorry I forgot the story makes more sense if you spend a week partying right now
[2:50:37] <%Faustgesicht> Oh hey the heads back
[2:50:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Heads Back
[2:50:39] <%dekkitout> The head's back?
[2:50:40] <%Monkeyweed21> HEADS BACK
[2:50:40] <d3ltuhhh> THE HEAD
[2:50:45] <haisho> why is the head back
[2:50:48] <%terrible35> best friend head is back
[2:50:49] <robosqueeb> diaper changing time
[2:50:52] <%InternetShis> HUSK HEAD RETURNS
[2:50:53] <%SinnerEbru> br√∂ther m√§y √Ø h√§ve s√∂me √∂rbs
[2:50:55] <Forbidden_Karp> Screamy the screaming head
[2:50:59] <%Faustgesicht> head got better
[2:51:18] <secret_npc> The James part is too good so the head respawns I guess lol
[2:51:30] <DatAsuna> Cause we definitely want the harsh tonal whiplash of leviathan into citadel into ending rather than leviathan, ending, citadel for a consistent tonal progression
[2:51:43] <%Dakuu75> "How did you know it would grow back?"
[2:51:45] <@Ranryu692> @DatAsuna I would explain why you're wrong about that but I don't want to spoil lol
[2:51:48] <+SmigGames> you guys don't have respawning heads?
[2:51:57] <@Ranryu692> @DatAsuna but it's not even a full week
[2:52:07] <marvel877> My cousin's 2 year old has a fever and her 13 year old has been throwing up, how's everyone's night been so far?
[2:52:12] <DatAsuna> You could DM me your reasoning but it's more about tone
[2:52:26] <DatAsuna> Going leviathan citadel ending is just a bummer
[2:52:32] <%DrTomT18> As fun as it is to watch Pat experience Mass Effect 3 for the first time, I'd rather watch him play Outer Wilds lmao
[2:52:41] <@Ranryu692> @DatAsuna personally I'm of the opinion that Citadel actually makes sense earlier in the game, rather than leaving it for the end
[2:52:44] <peachy996> I would rather not end this on Tell me another story about the Shepard.
[2:52:53] <+SmigGames> I agree, I prefer leviathan and then the ending
[2:53:06] <marvel877> Has Pat seen the new, barely there Bandai Namco logo?
[2:53:16] <peachy996> It's bad enough I heard so many times when I played it, I don't want to have that experiene again
[2:53:24] <%jillyrancher> I would normally agree about breaks and shit but Pat is like 98% done. just push through and finish.
[2:53:26] <+MrBaldachin> @Ranryu692 citadel like never makes sense at any point, it always feels like a silly diversion if you don't suspend your disbelief
[2:53:29] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna well then your preferred place to put it is impossible now
[2:53:33] <+SmigGames> tonally, the citadel doesn't make much sense at any point during the apocalypse
[2:53:55] <%jillyrancher> It's supposed to be forced shore leave
[2:53:57] <peachy996> yeah but ME3 sucks ass and we need to end this on a feel good
[2:53:58] <DatAsuna> I think citadel should be experienced in the context most players experienced, their goodbye to the series.
[2:54:03] <DatAsuna> Rather than a weird filler chapter
[2:54:12] <peachy996> Like Tuchanka Arc has been over for months
[2:54:20] <peachy996> It's all been downhill from there
[2:54:24] <%DrTomT18> @SmigGames I mean, even the Big Hero Man needs a breather. The biggest problem I have with all Bioware games is that you never get a sense of how much time is passing.
[2:54:30] <d3ltuhhh> nah it was downhill from rannoch
[2:54:38] <secret_npc> AI came out on game pass, should I play
[2:54:39] <%afronooch> yep
[2:54:45] <peachy996> Oh Rannoch sucked
[2:54:46] <DSD24> Rannoch was the best
[2:54:50] <DatAsuna> I consider rannoch to be the start of the downhill
[2:54:54] <peachy996> Idiot Quarians
[2:54:58] <DatAsuna> Rannoch sucked
[2:55:06] <Sp3ctre48> I can't stand the Rannoch plot so it drops off after Tuchanka imo
[2:55:07] <DatAsuna> Shepard ended apartheid by telling everyone to stop it
[2:55:13] <%DrTomT18> How much time do YOU think passes in Mass Effect 3?
[2:55:15] <%jillyrancher> I always play right before the ending as one last moment of pure fun before the end. I really like the bittersweet feel of the Citadel ending knowing it's all about to end.
[2:55:28] <peachy996> And the Geth turn into real boy individuals
[2:55:32] <DatAsuna> Hey israel and palestine, just stop it, commander shepard says so
[2:55:38] <DatAsuna> "okay we'll just stop being racist"
[2:55:42] <secret_npc> I really think Pat should peace tf out on ME3 for a while
[2:55:47] <%afronooch> you kinda have to do citadel at the end depending on who you want to see
[2:55:56] <@QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Commander Shepard could get Janeway to stop making WMDs by yelling at her
[2:56:06] <d3ltuhhh> I'm pretty sure ME3 is supposed to only last a few months but I always thought that was stupid and that it was more like a year at least
[2:56:07] <%jillyrancher> Hes literally almost done. like 3 streams at most.
[2:56:18] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:56:19] <bear_breaker20> wouldnt it be funny if he just didnt do citadel
[2:56:31] <DatAsuna> Yeah if he wanted to, he could probably squeeze both leviathan and the ending into one stream
[2:56:32] <@QueequegTheater> @jillyrancher Citadel on its own is like 3-4 streams
[2:56:35] <peachy996> I think a compromise is doing the mission in the story but saving the Party for last
[2:56:44] <DatAsuna> Citadel ain't that long
[2:56:45] <Sp3ctre48> Janeway could NEVER stop making WMDs
[2:56:46] <secret_npc> Yeah, potentially the best streams of the trilogy coming up and dude is fucking exhausted
[2:56:49] <%jillyrancher> it's really not. one full stream probably
[2:56:54] <DatAsuna> Citadel could be easily done in 1 long stream
[2:56:58] <peachy996> @DatAsuna In this stream? No way
[2:56:59] <%ThomasOfTroy> No way in hell is Citadel 3-4 streams
[2:57:02] <%jillyrancher> 3-4 hours at most
[2:57:04] <%DrTomT18> depends on how long Pat plans on streaming
[2:57:04] <DatAsuna> Especially since he's not relaoding choices
[2:57:06] <%afronooch> citadel if he ignores everything but its plot isnt that long
[2:57:08] <Retinolgaming> There really isnt that much left. It just depends how much time he wants to spend in certain places.
[2:57:13] <peachy996> We have Horizon and THAT other mission before we get back to Earth
[2:57:14] <%jillyrancher> Not this one no
[2:57:14] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 Leviathan ain't that long
[2:57:15] <%polothegreatest> are we having re6 level of spite?
[2:57:15] <@Ranryu692> Citadel is probably 1 and a half streams, especially on narrative mode
[2:57:27] <@QueequegTheater> Chat is forgetting just how much extra shit is in Citadel
[2:57:28] <%jillyrancher> Horizon is really short
[2:57:32] <d3ltuhhh> ^
[2:57:33] <+cermo55> It's kinda jarring pacing wise, but you can do sanctuary before citadel, since the mission after sanctuary is the point of no return
[2:57:34] <secret_npc> I reckon like a 2 week break before Citadel
[2:57:35] <%DrTomT18> ignoring all the post-story stuff in Citidle completly misses the point of the DLC
[2:57:47] <Sp3ctre48> Citadel could be long or short depending on how much side stuff he wants to do, there's a ton of it in that dlc
[2:57:58] <knight_verse> Literally takes almost a month break every other week after a ME3 stream.
[2:58:09] <%jillyrancher> No I'm really not. It's got a lot of content but I finished my playthrough of Citadel in a full eventually
[2:58:13] <Retinolgaming> ^ Tru LUL
[2:58:21] <DatAsuna> Even if he does do the citadel story now, the party should at least wait for post game imho
[2:58:25] <@QueequegTheater> @jillyrancher You weren't streaming
[2:58:34] <%jillyrancher> God don't do that, just finish it.
[2:58:45] <%DrTomT18> Pat is taking the fattest piss of his life rn
[2:59:02] <%afronooch> nah hes just watching us
[2:59:07] <%afronooch> and giggling
[2:59:14] <%jtdobyns> Citadel is prob like 5ish hours
[2:59:15] <~PatStaresAt> its true
[2:59:23] <%afronooch> I KNEW IT
[2:59:27] <%jillyrancher> Chat bicker for consus
[2:59:32] <DatAsuna> If citadel isn't one big stream it'll be a very short slice of another stream
[2:59:33] <secret_npc> yeah idk if I were him I'd take a nice long break after Leviathan
[2:59:41] <+McSoliace> it was quite obvioua
[2:59:46] <+McSoliace> fuck
[2:59:49] <knight_verse> He's changing his pants cause he pissed himself.
[3:00:01] <$Cthulos> Did he do Leviathan tonight?
[3:00:04] <DatAsuna> God, if he just has like 15 minutes of citadel then right into horizon one a session that would the worst lmao
[3:00:12] <TioXyco> @Cthulos he doing it
[3:00:21] <DatAsuna> @Cthulos about a third of it
[3:00:24] <%thedankestmeeme> hey am I in that crowd of people?
[3:00:37] <%jillyrancher> penultimate mission and Earth are one stream, Citadel is one.
[3:00:42] <%Axellogic> Biscuts are made of food
[3:00:50] <%thedankestmeeme> I'm pooping too
[3:00:53] <%dekkitout> Score Warz
[3:00:55] <DatAsuna> Ending on the good taste is the way to leave it
[3:00:58] <%DrTomT18> war score and seven streams ago
[3:00:59] <tanarath> You should have skipped Omega.
[3:01:00] <%jillyrancher> Dont you dare
[3:01:05] <%InternetShis> War Score and 7 days ago
[3:01:05] <peachy996> See?
[3:01:09] <DatAsuna> Personally I would never wash citadel down with kai leng right after
[3:01:10] <peyodogo> poop easy dankest
[3:01:11] <secret_npc> We just want you feeling your best
[3:01:12] <%Monkeyweed21> its the carrot on the stick and ITS A GOOD CARROT
[3:01:21] <%professionalwitchburner> Problem with Citadel is that for the best outcome you'd have to do it DEAD last
[3:01:21] <+dd44dostivei> doing citadel before or after the ending?
[3:01:21] <@QueequegTheater> NO BUT CHAT INSISTED YOU'RE TIRED
[3:01:21] <%DrTomT18> no?
[3:01:22] <$hattrick61> no?
[3:01:22] <lloyddboy> huh??
[3:01:23] <peachy996> You don't want to end this on Tell Me Another Story about the Shepard
[3:01:25] <%DrTomT18> there is no post game
[3:01:27] <peachy996> It SUKS
[3:01:28] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[3:01:28] <Moffin23> how can you do it after?
[3:01:29] <Brandon__Brando> I never heard about that
[3:01:31] <%bread_assassin> ?????
[3:01:31] <peyodogo> how would you
[3:01:32] <fetelgeuse> Nope.
[3:01:32] <%jtdobyns> When I played mass effect 3 i never had javik or citadel
[3:01:32] <+dmbender> thats a mod
[3:01:33] <Brandon__Brando> I think that was a mod
[3:01:36] <DatAsuna> Citadel doesn't make any sense at any point
[3:01:38] <@QueequegTheater> After the Citadel story is done, before the endign
[3:01:38] <%afronooch> Post Citadel DLC plot
[3:01:38] <%crassletter> KINDA ITS NOT GOOD
[3:01:40] <TioXyco> why would it even be?
[3:01:40] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not true
[3:01:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:44] <%jillyrancher> Yeah there is not Pat.
[3:01:44] <%InternetShis> That's a Vanilla 3 mod
[3:01:47] <+jojo_abob> you can pretend its the end i guess
[3:01:48] <%Mattais88> No there's a story, and then a party afterwards
[3:01:49] <fetelgeuse> Post-story in the DLC has stuff to do.
[3:01:49] <%ArchimerCXV> people have internalised a literal mod
[3:01:50] <+DatGuyJimbo> you miss tali if you dont conclude her story first
[3:01:54] <%professionalwitchburner> It was a ME3 vanilla mod
[3:01:54] <secret_npc> There is no post game in ME3
[3:01:54] <TioXyco> people be drunk
[3:01:55] <%jillyrancher> I dunno who told you that but that's not true
[3:01:57] <peachy996> They mean doing everything except the mission that locks you in
[3:01:57] <Archmortal> you create a save, then you beat game, then you reload
[3:01:58] <DatAsuna> That's not what you think it is
[3:01:59] <Sp3ctre48> nah it's stuff people would want you to do after the end of the game
[3:02:04] <@Ranryu692> there's a story in the DLC, and post-that story
[3:02:07] <%jillyrancher> There is no post game lol
[3:02:07] <%DrTomT18> that's not what I meant lmao
[3:02:08] <Moffin23> I thought ME3 pulled an FO NV, maybe I am misremembering
[3:02:08] <%InternetShis> THAT'S A MOD CALLED CITADEL EPILOGUE MOD
[3:02:08] <DatAsuna> Basically citadel has linear story, then optional stuff
[3:02:11] <jtsoppy137> that god damn party LUL
[3:02:13] <DatAsuna> so they meant post citadel story
[3:02:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt he means thematically
[3:02:17] <secret_npc> Let's move on from Citadel
[3:02:24] <fetelgeuse> You gonna pop it again, monster?
[3:02:30] <DatAsuna> give the head a donut
[3:02:32] <%ape_hawk> that guy wont get a... head... in life
[3:02:33] <%DrTomT18> @Ranryu692 yes, that's what I meant, thank you Ranryu
[3:02:35] <Retinolgaming> Pat will like citadel, its worth sticking it out to the end imo.
[3:02:38] <%mai_waifu_> I would laugh at that head for 10 minutes at a time when I played OG ME3
[3:02:42] <%jillyrancher> That head is cute
[3:02:46] <%jillyrancher> I want one
[3:02:52] <$Teh_Un> If you leave the head until the 3rd visit, you can get it as a pet
[3:02:55] <%jtdobyns> Remember the Artifact in ME1
[3:02:55] <DatAsuna> @Retinolgaming I don't think anyone doubts he'll enjoy it
[3:02:56] <%Axellogic> Robot Bearing Hips are weird
[3:03:00] <$Teh_Un> It will scream at your hamster
[3:03:01] <@ssjklyco> IT will help you grow
[3:03:04] <%InternetShis> @jillyrancher Guess what
[3:03:06] <shallaska> this dude's in the pocket of BIG MILK
[3:03:09] <AluxStreams> "EDI, can you add a filter for "planets with funny names?"
[3:03:11] <%xcompleasedad> Some people have lactose intolerance

[3:03:29] <TioXyco> I like how Shepard is like "I'm soldier but dumb" here LUL
[3:03:30] <%valriot> Wasnt the Loch Ness monster just a bad picture of a massive whale cock?
[3:03:32] <peachy996> How is that mid tier
[3:03:34] <DatAsuna> That's a BG2 reference right?
[3:03:37] <%ape_hawk> avoid the gaze!
[3:03:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> EDI just wants to nerd out
[3:03:41] <peachy996> Are you downplaying?
[3:03:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't have milk, because of the lactose you see
[3:03:44] <@Ranryu692> @valriot ah yes, those famous lake whales
[3:03:51] <%InternetShis> FACE AWAY FROM THE GAZE

[3:04:26] <%Profmcstevie> I'm european, I can handle cow milk no problem I just think it tastes weird
[3:04:32] <@ssjklyco> I've learned from Mythical Kitchen  that no one consumes more dairy than Lactose intolerant.
[3:04:42] <secret_npc> soy milk and lactose free are good
[3:04:42] <%jillyrancher> They are which shocked me
[3:04:44] <%bahookery> @Monkeyweed21 ah yes the good ol magnet hands that would pull you from around the corner
[3:04:45] <DatAsuna> Japanese milk is the weirdest to me
[3:04:56] <DatAsuna> it's weirdly lukewarm
[3:04:58] <@Ranryu692> whenever I visit family in Europe I giggle at the milk being stored outside of the fridge before being opened
[3:05:00] <%jillyrancher> I got killed by a Phantom for the first time in my life in single player on LE

[3:11:29] <%hewlettfan96> He‚Äôs not human an animal
[3:11:33] <@ssjklyco> Considering his random love for Kites, he will probably get like a hamster or something and talk about how they can do hamster races that he never knew about.

[3:11:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @hewlettfan96 animals are humans too
[3:11:57] <%SaiyanShoto> Hawks snatch up small dogs where I live so mostly everyone‚Äôs dogs are indoor dogs

[3:18:43] <@Ranryu692> @hax_metatron probably next stream
[3:18:46] <%thebeargoesHONK> windows are a structural weakness
[3:18:48] <Moffin23> who got the worst deal in becoming husks? batarians for being giant puss bags, or the Krogan and Turians getting spliced together
[3:18:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man she doesn't sound panicky when she fucking says "My assistant hawkins"

[3:19:29] <lloyddboy> look at those dragon gifs
[3:19:32] <%StaceMcGate> game becomes a high-tec visual novel on baby difficulty
[3:19:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> THERE WE GO
[3:19:40] <+Bealy_beal> Import-tahn-tay
[3:19:43] <%ape_hawk> NOT BOYLES!
[3:19:45] <Laecerelius> Oops, all dead!
[3:19:47] <%ape_hawk> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:19:49] <akitanito> no hp
[3:20:00] <@Ranryu692> did Boyles... pop? psaBougie
[3:20:06] <SomeAsianDood> She seems real freaked out by her colleagues dying
[3:20:06] <Ranger747> king of Limbs art
[3:20:06] <akitanito> don't crazy talk yourself
[3:20:10] <%ape_hawk> but pat, what if the reapers ALSO play in baby mode?
[3:20:10] <%StaceMcGate> what happens if you die on baby difficulty?
[3:20:12] <%dekkitout> Hyooj hero guy
[3:20:16] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt if the protheans had discovered narrative mode maybe they wouldn't have lost the war with the reapers
[3:20:18] <+Bealy_beal> Baby man mode doodDerp
[3:20:18] <TioXyco> yes you can and you already were before
[3:20:19] <TheAntiNihilist> shooty shooty bang bang
[3:20:20] <Moffin23> can't stop you, what kind of monster would hit a baby?
[3:20:23] <%DrTomT18> other than the art work on the wall this mission is pretty eh
[3:20:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man this must be some amazing crawfish if so many people were coming to see it and it got cave paintings
[3:20:26] <%Profmcstevie> I love Baby Mode Shepard
[3:20:27] <%thebeargoesHONK> shall we expect you to play baby mode Bayo 3 (when it finally drops)?
[3:20:33] <+Bealy_beal> LUL
[3:20:35] <%SinnerEbru> @stacemcgate you die in real life
[3:20:40] <Jaysky> Yeah probably
[3:20:43] <TheAntiNihilist> @stacemcgate you die in real life
[3:20:44] <%MelBrooksKA> @Moffin23 Pat would
[3:20:44] <cpt_langosta> good for him... i mean, oh no
[3:20:48] <%jackelzxaa> wait why aren't pats eyeballs sticking out of his head
[3:20:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Maybe this was an old crawfish resturant
[3:20:55] <%jackelzxaa> did they patch that?
[3:21:07] <%Dakuu75> Somber
[3:21:08] <ohno778> they dead bitch
[3:21:18] <Dunmarkh> @jackelzxaa it's just random
[3:21:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jackelzxaa no
[3:21:25] <+Bealy_beal> Pat has more hair than that Shepard
[3:21:33] <%bevyrage> @jackelzxaa it's only for a few particular scenes
[3:21:35] <Laecerelius> Gotta throw those spears at the reaper!
[3:21:41] <%jackelzxaa> i wonder if it just doesnt effect dlc content because of polish reasons
[3:21:42] <Jaysky> Ma'am speak up the music is shouting
[3:21:51] <%StaceMcGate> how could cave paintings last over 50,000 years so clearly?
[3:21:54] <%king_wragles> I'm assuming this plot line has nothing done with it?
[3:22:02] <%jackelzxaa> imagine if the entire game had been as polished as this fucking dlc
[3:22:03] <+Basker17> Man this dialog is so stilted
[3:22:03] <%ape_hawk> plot
[3:22:04] <cpt_langosta> they forgot their glasses
[3:22:04] <DatAsuna> The reapers never see you
[3:22:09] <%RealThiele> ascian reaper
[3:22:09] <%jackelzxaa> instead of only most of the game
[3:22:14] <xbb1024> cause you're like ants
[3:22:18] <DatAsuna> IMagine if that reaper that killed the kid bothered to shoot the normandy that was right in front of it
[3:22:22] <+cermo55> short time is good
[3:22:23] <%dekkitout> Red reapers? That seems too easy...
[3:22:24] <bear_breaker20> its him, its shields
[3:22:29] <%studleydoorite> @StaceMcGate they're laser-etched into the wall
[3:22:29] <natzo89> mora than 50k years. maybe millions
[3:22:30] <%thebeargoesHONK> let me guess.  this mission gives you a DLC reaper companion?
[3:22:47] <%jillyrancher> I always assumed the Reaper IFF makes the Normandy invisible to Reapers
[3:22:54] <natzo89> the oldest killed Reaper was 32 million years old ago
[3:22:58] <%Dakuu75> are we suppose to blow these things up?
[3:23:01] <TheAntiNihilist> za darkshness
[3:23:05] <+cermo55> @thebeargoesHONK i wish
[3:23:10] <%jackelzxaa> pat's gonna shoot em with his face and his fist
[3:23:11] <%Axellogic> Shoot them with your fist
[3:23:24] <%jackelzxaa> pat killed the reapers
[3:23:25] <%StaceMcGate> BABY MODE TOO STRONG
[3:23:25] <%Faustgesicht> what a hero
[3:23:27] <%GhoulishCripple> the Vanguard warp and slam is still my favorite combo in ME3
[3:23:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh look Dragon skeleton framework
[3:23:28] <%rkbinder> The ending of this DLC is the stupidest thing I could think of
[3:23:30] <%tank7013> Damn for baby mode that was a lot of health
[3:23:33] <+Ropcord> you did it
[3:23:34] <SomeAsianDood> BABBY MODE OP
[3:23:36] <Jaysky> THis fight seems real hard
[3:23:36] <Laecerelius> Good job, Garrus
[3:23:37] <Moffin23> were Harveter's in the base game, been so long since I played
[3:23:38] <%RealThiele> big hero
[3:23:38] <%jackelzxaa> the secret reason for narrative mode is probably so pat doesnt burn out like he did with nier
[3:23:49] <DatAsuna> @jillyrancher Except the reapers have actual literal cameras to see and shoot with
[3:23:51] <@ssjklyco> Earth should have turned on easy mode, then they would have beat the reapers
[3:24:00] <Sp3ctre48> Really rapid firing that Claymore Tali
[3:24:00] <+Bealy_beal> BabyRage doodBeamL doodBeam doodGood
[3:24:15] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt is there any chance of just...hacking your save to have 99 of all items to go back to nier or has it been too long?
[3:24:18] <%ape_hawk> also spite
[3:24:23] <peachy996> It's not going fast enough
[3:24:24] <%ape_hawk> spite is the cherry on to[
[3:24:25] <%DrTomT18> yup, shes a scientist
[3:24:27] <%ape_hawk> top*
[3:24:28] <DatAsuna> There's no explaining it, it's just dumb plot armour
[3:24:29] <%akscully> but don't you want to learn how to overcome adversity?
[3:24:31] <Jaysky> Nothing wrong with the combat but you've also played through 1 and 2
[3:24:33] <DatAsuna> shepard has a lot of dumb plot armour
[3:24:34] <%professionalwitchburner> Reapers annihilate Earth *easy mode is now selectable*
[3:24:34] <@QueequegTheater> She has the doctor haircut
[3:24:46] <TheAntiNihilist> in short. combat is boring and repetitive. who'd guess...
[3:24:49] <%StaceMcGate> bout that
[3:24:55] <+Ropcord> oof
[3:24:59] <Sp3ctre48> I played on hard when I was going through Replicant and that was really a mistake
[3:25:08] <peachy996> Why not?
[3:25:10] <akitanito> he big ded
[3:25:10] <%Monkeyweed21> I just sorta watched it happen
[3:25:13] <mr_saturday93> why does she look older than her dad?
[3:25:15] <cpt_langosta> went down in one, like a bitch
[3:25:17] <%thedankestmeeme> are you in east in tales too? I heard they still hit hard
[3:25:18] <%twistedj3ster> HE DEAD AF, YO
[3:25:22] <peachy996> Who made you the decider of can't be dead?
[3:25:23] <%jackelzxaa> the combat's cool if you want it but it also is gonna make the game take 20% longer if you have to actually fight enemies instead of clicking on them to make them go away
[3:25:24] <%thedankestmeeme> easy*
[3:25:28] <%akscully> man, stop being vague as fuck shep
[3:25:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> HE DIED A WEEK BEFORE SHEPARD WAS THERE
[3:25:36] <natzo89> Andromeda next, Right?

[3:27:50] <%jackelzxaa> i dont know if joker or steve have dialog between missions but it doesnt take long to check since they're next to the others
[3:28:01] <@ssjklyco> Dr .  Ann Bryson..... DAB
[3:28:05] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Yeah, all DLCs have dialogue except for Omega since your squad didn't go with you.
[3:28:10] <natzo89> the asari in the hospital killed jokers system @patstaresat
[3:28:10] <%WeLucklessJacks> Poor Joker
[3:28:23] <%jillyrancher> Tali has a unique romance one
[3:28:23] <natzo89> sister
[3:28:23] <+Peacefrog7> isnt hillsry the girl that the asari with ptsd had to kill @PatStaresAt
[3:28:31] <peachy996> YEAH

[3:28:40] <%StaceMcGate> just finish the DLC if ya don't care Pat
[3:28:42] <%jackelzxaa> hi kaiden

[3:29:06] <%akscully> love ME kaidan
[3:29:07] <RyuuAoi> Is Pat at the end of the game?
[3:29:11] <d3ltuhhh> @bread_assassin yep LUL
[3:29:16] <natzo89> smadt. s m r t. smart
[3:29:20] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt did chat spoil the twist or did you already know long before?
[3:29:21] <%jtdobyns> DLC like this should only have dialog after... SO people can not worry.
[3:29:22] <%JamesCorck> Thessia is worse than the Ending.
[3:29:23] <DatAsuna> Don't worry, The next main story is even worse
[3:29:24] <metalsiren31> Thessia is REALLY BAD
[3:29:25] <peachy996> Omega was a nut shot too
[3:29:27] <%Mattais88> Even Rannoch isn't good
[3:29:28] <%akscully> you're a bird, garrus
[3:29:30] <%JamesCorck> Thessia is way worse than the Ending.
[3:29:31] <%InternetShis> TAKE OUT THE SUPPORTS
[3:29:34] <captain_kirkhammer> This game's quality is a nearly perfect exponential decay
[3:29:36] <+BigCoffee> wow gj chat
[3:29:37] <jtsoppy137> did anyone else get to the last paragon/renegade check fail it?
[3:29:37] <%kujofire990> BUT KAI LANG THO
[3:29:38] <xbb1024> what happened?
[3:29:40] <cpt_langosta> Thessia really shows they ran out of time. All other major story beats got multiple missions, but Thessia got one.
[3:29:41] <mr_saturday93> nice job chat....

[3:29:58] <blackjack8182> Omega was also bad
[3:30:00] <%jackelzxaa> i usually like to spread the dlc out along the game because it ends up feeling weird to me to do it all at once
[3:30:01] <%professionalwitchburner> SPOILER: The game ends
[3:30:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The back third of this game really isn't great compared to the rest of it
[3:30:05] <DatAsuna> The tiptree thing isn't leviathan
[3:30:05] <%Profmcstevie> Bunch of fucking Navis in chat
[3:30:06] <RyuuAoi> Why chat? So stupid.
[3:30:07] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt I meant for Leviathan DLC
[3:30:08] <%Dakuu75> One-Guy-Omega
[3:30:13] <+SmigGames> just ban everyone in the chat
[3:30:13] <%InternetShis> Time for emotes
[3:30:13] <akitanito> why even
[3:30:15] <%Rumbutt> Pat, chat is full of idiots, remember that for later
[3:30:18] <%DrTomT18> that's actually kinda funny
[3:30:21] <%jtdobyns> was it the same person who told you to remember the datr?
[3:30:25] <%MightyDuckShoes> wait what was the twist? joker has a home some where?
[3:30:27] <peachy996> I feel sorry for the poor bastard that did Thessia after Omega
[3:30:32] <%Piemono> The Trailer for Leviathan spoils it anyway
[3:30:32] <Dunmarkh> And then he played
[3:30:40] <peachy996> Or Omega after Thessia
[3:30:41] <+LittleCinders> I both love and hate between quest dialogue
[3:30:41] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You should really consider putting chat in emote only mode for some games
[3:30:42] <%akscully> I'LL KILL YOU
[3:30:48] <+Peacefrog7> jesus
[3:30:49] <DianaTheAscian> thats fair
[3:30:53] <jtsoppy137> Javik keepin it real
[3:30:54] <%jackelzxaa> people trying to micromanage plot revelations for people is the worst
[3:30:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats a good point
[3:31:00] <DatAsuna> About what any reaper could do to you
[3:31:02] <@Ranryu692> 9 years old
[3:31:03] <%JamesCorck> Ten.
[3:31:03] <%Profmcstevie> Once a defector always a defector
[3:31:04] <%DrTomT18> almost 10 years old
[3:31:06] <%JamesCorck> 9 really.
[3:31:07] <%ape_hawk> 9, pat
[3:31:07] <d3ltuhhh> ME1 is like 14 years old
[3:31:08] <%Mattais88> 2009
[3:31:09] <%StaceMcGate> its almost 10 years old
[3:31:10] <+Daedalus119> basically a thousand years old
[3:31:11] <%ThomasOfTroy> Like 8
[3:31:12] <%polothegreatest> old gaem
[3:31:13] <cpt_langosta> If you ever play Microsoft Bob, I promise not to spoil anything
[3:31:13] <%afronooch> 2012?
[3:31:15] <Jetsfantasy> Emote only for 40 hours LUL
[3:31:15] <@QueequegTheater> 9
[3:31:15] <oda_flobunaga> 25 years old
[3:31:21] <%JamesCorck> 2012
[3:31:22] <%ErikFeral> Oh no, not the infamous ending being spoiled...
[3:31:22] <%Profmcstevie> and console locked for most of those years
[3:31:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> THE GAME IS IN DOUBLE DIGITS
[3:31:24] <%cvp5127> can you teach woolie that
[3:31:27] <metalsiren31> 84 years old
[3:31:30] <+Soliloquy123> Also murders stream engagement
[3:31:30] <robintact> Spoiler mode for a 9 year old game is a Woolie tactic, Pat
[3:31:31] <DatAsuna> That's not all she can eat
[3:31:32] <Sp3ctre48> S-Stop talking to my girlfriend so much Garrus
[3:31:32] <@ssjklyco> That is a good point
[3:31:35] <@Ranryu692> that convo is more flirty if you aren't banging one of them
[3:31:38] <%jackelzxaa> the only thing i hate worse than micromanaging is people telling me to read the visual novel instead of the anime i'm watching.  (higurashi)
[3:31:41] <%jackelzxaa> don't forget james
[3:31:42] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:45] <%ElkRiverDog> You really need an Emote Only option for point redeem
[3:31:48] <alrobot2014> it always seems as though the mass effect series is always older than it is in your mind
[3:31:56] <macathelo> u forget guts
[3:32:04] <Sp3ctre48> ooooooh nooooooo
[3:32:05] <%professionalwitchburner> READ THE MANUSCRIPT
[3:32:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> "secondary"
[3:32:07] <KnivesEve> oh man thats a real
[3:32:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Liara doesnt have to get her stomach pumped
[3:32:09] <DatAsuna> "wry'd the manga"
[3:32:12] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:32:16] <%twistedj3ster> oh no
[3:32:17] <+Urgoslav> READ BERSERK
[3:32:17] <Moffin23> the two good romances right there, Jack is a close second
[3:32:20] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[3:32:20] <+AgniBrandt> But Higurashi's anime is great
[3:32:21] <Moffin23> and thane
[3:32:22] <%twistedj3ster> ohhhh noo
[3:32:23] <akitanito> I can't even read visual novels anymore
[3:32:23] <+HellCopter> Sometimes the anime really is that bad though!! See: Umineko
[3:32:24] <%SinnerEbru> shoutout to higurashi, and the VN which maybe 6 people played
[3:32:27] <cpt_langosta> EASY ANSWER: DON'T
[3:32:29] <Jetsfantasy> Just start from Melty Blood :)
[3:32:30] <%DrTomT18> I still don't know what Dextro Amino means
[3:32:31] <%professionalwitchburner> "Play the Gacha game"
[3:32:35] <%Profmcstevie> Wherever you want
[3:32:35] <%jtdobyns> it sucks we never really see the Tali/garrus relationship. Male shep goes for tali and fem goes for garrus haha
[3:32:36] <%polothegreatest> the cicadas ones? i peace out on episode 1
[3:32:37] <%machshop> LUL
[3:32:37] <DianaTheAscian> isn't it a meme at this point?
[3:32:38] <metalsiren31> Just wikidive Fate
[3:32:39] <+dmbender> ooof
[3:32:40] <%miguelrod777> no one says that
[3:32:40] <TheAntiNihilist> it's great
[3:32:41] <Visorak6> I mean they're not wrong
[3:32:42] <kingra> You get in at FGO
[3:32:43] <macathelo> u forgot space mexican guts
[3:32:43] <%Mattais88> Yeah, but it's so much better than every adaptaion
[3:32:44] <%ErikFeral> Do We Start With The P*RN?
[3:32:46] <%DrTomT18> Don't play Fate, just enjoy the porn like a real hero
[3:32:46] <bear_breaker20> read the hentai
[3:32:46] <mak0t0yukii> Just play the gacha Kappa
[3:32:46] <+AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Unlimited Blade works or Fate/Zero.
[3:32:48] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt Most fate fans are actually stupid and the actual answer is "start wherever, unless its a sequel season"
[3:32:48] <peyodogo> umineko vn is the only way to experience umineko
[3:32:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> or just watch fate/stay
[3:32:53] <+Bealy_beal> Naww
[3:32:54] <%jackelzxaa> edi decided to be naked this time
[3:32:56] <+AgniBrandt> That's the easy answer
[3:32:56] <peyodogo> tbf. like the anime is trash fire
[3:32:57] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz one group says the anime is fine and the other SCREAMS  about the VN
[3:32:59] <KnivesEve> where to start fate? easy play the gatcha fate go
[3:33:00] <+PenmanLupine> I will not play a bad porn game just to learn about your gacha pulls
[3:33:01] <%ErikFeral> psaBig psaWrong
[3:33:04] <%jackelzxaa> sometimes edi just doesnt feel like clothes
[3:33:05] <%jillyrancher> Higurashi is easy to get into too
[3:33:06] <+ALazo> If only the adaptation of the first fate thing wasn't absolute trash we could point at it
[3:33:07] <%WeLucklessJacks> That is exactly right.
[3:33:08] <%ArchimerCXV> @PatStaresAt the problem with people suggesting where to get in on fate is they will suggest what can get you to what they want to talk about the quickest
[3:33:09] <cpt_langosta> eat her dad's cereal in front of her like a badass.
[3:33:09] <Tracazoid> "Play long visual novel, or watch the fucked up first route of the anime...oh wait."
[3:33:11] <Sp3ctre48> Umineko's manga is alright
[3:33:12] <@Spydurman> they left her in their alone??
[3:33:12] <jtsoppy137> oh hey your dad is dead
[3:33:13] <%castlerock42> Just accept you can't win with fate.
[3:33:13] <akitanito> I'd rather you read the wiki summary then watch the anime
[3:33:14] <$hattrick61> its the overlord music, for some reason
[3:33:14] <+AgniBrandt> @peyodogo I read the manga instead.
[3:33:17] <+Bealy_beal> Probably better to live without it
[3:33:17] <+ALazo> So instead we get all the spinoffs, prequels and alternate universes
[3:33:18] <peachy996> Is this a reused theme from Overlord?
[3:33:19] <@Spydurman> After she was indoctrinated?
[3:33:19] <%ErikFeral> Where to start with Fate. 1) Do Not.
[3:33:19] <%bread_assassin> @ElkRiverDog Man, we need SOMETIHNG for point redeem. I have enough points to highlight every single comment I make moving forward.
[3:33:22] <peachy996> Wow....
[3:33:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did she get stung by a bee?
[3:33:25] <ExpressNode> Only VN series I spent a long time in was the Utawarerumono games
[3:33:26] <%zeroarturia> I love Fate but the fandom is awful
[3:33:27] <%WeLucklessJacks> Fate Grand Order is a good entry point too.
[3:33:27] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The real answer is read the Wikipedia plot summary of the VN then watch Zero
[3:33:28] <blackjack8182> Fate is trash
[3:33:28] <cpt_langosta> indiana, huh?
[3:33:29] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 yup
[3:33:32] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Fun fact Tali has dialogue for Grunt mission where you find out she's terrified of spiders.
[3:33:38] <mr_saturday93> Her cheeks are huge
[3:33:40] <%polothegreatest> chat, bring the flowchart
[3:33:40] <xerioes> The answer is you dont get in
[3:33:41] <peachy996> Leviathan DLC has leftovers music wise. Never noticed
[3:33:43] <%jackelzxaa> i've been watching all the higurashi animes in order and i'm having fun.  (i have to find time to watch the new ep tomorrow or something)
[3:33:44] <DatAsuna> the lip sync ain't great
[3:33:46] <peyodogo> manga is alright i guess but you do miss out on a lot
[3:33:49] <%studleydoorite> why does she have a purple tinge?  is she pregnant?
[3:33:51] <DianaTheAscian> Is this the spider man thing?
[3:33:52] <%professionalwitchburner> How to Start Fate: Consider maybe not at all ever
[3:33:56] <+dd44dostivei> jesus why does this scene exist
[3:33:59] <%Dakuu75> give her the pitty sex
[3:34:01] <%InternetShis> I should go
[3:34:05] <+Bealy_beal> We'll bang, okay? doodDerp
[3:34:11] <Sp3ctre48> @ExpressNode Nice, Uta is a great series
[3:34:11] <%ThomasOfTroy> BUT FEELINGS
[3:34:14] <+Kodkiro> ya i was thinking the same
[3:34:15] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Must Care
[3:34:17] <%akscully> man, no one deals with grief in this game
[3:34:19] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[3:34:22] <+Bealy_beal> LUL
[3:34:24] <%DrTomT18> TELL ME, CAN I FUCK THE REAPER KILLER?
[3:34:26] <mr_saturday93> pat. cum on
[3:34:27] <DianaTheAscian> this is super out of place
[3:34:27] <%ape_hawk> EMOSHUNS, PAT
[3:34:28] <%kyh9> Is this Leviathan?
[3:34:28] <%studleydoorite> I like to imagine Pat saying this during this monologue
[3:34:29] <%Piemono> No you super care tho shut up
[3:34:29] <%Profmcstevie> Cry more, tell me about aliens
[3:34:29] <macathelo> feels pat, feels
[3:34:30] <blackjack8182> Who cares about this character?!
[3:34:30] <TheAntiNihilist> I just realized, wouldn't Pat LOVE bitch face Rin? she's like Super Asuka.
[3:34:31] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah I'm starting to remember why I don't remember much about this dlc
[3:34:31] <%kyh9> What is this?
[3:34:31] <d3ltuhhh> i mean you DID ask her how she was doing
[3:34:33] <%machshop> we have to pad the movie
[3:34:34] <RyuuAoi> Filler. Because that's what it need.
[3:34:36] <$Shaggy2124> oh noooo generic character we just learned about
[3:34:36] <jtsoppy137> Writing Flex
[3:34:37] <DatAsuna> @akscully especially not shepard if you romanced thane lmao
[3:34:39] <Laecerelius> Fuck your personal trauma, I want space monster!
[3:34:39] <%DrTomT18> I REALLY WISH YOUR DAD WASN'T DAD HE SEEMS MUCH COOLER
[3:34:40] <%professionalwitchburner> Your dad got killed by the default pistol. His life was meaningless
[3:34:42] <akitanito> no time for emotions, time for killing reapers
[3:34:43] <%Monkeyweed21> NO PAT CASEY HUDSON NEEDS HIS HUMAN PATHOS
[3:34:43] <%jackelzxaa> @peyodogo the thing is that not everyone is gonna wanna know everything about a thing and are fine with just what they end up with too
[3:34:43] <%Faustgesicht> Bitch, your dad said a total of 4 lines to me
[3:34:44] <%sunsetdisc0> brysons head looks like its too big for his body
[3:34:47] <$hattrick61> "i'll come back. we'll save this potentially war changing investigation for later."
[3:34:48] <@QueequegTheater> NOOOOO BUT CHARACTER DRAMA FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY DEAD AT THE START THOOOOO LOOK AT MY DRAMA PAT
[3:34:52] <%Bluwizard21> her dad looks like the psycho from GTA5
[3:34:55] <%jillyrancher> I'd care more if Bryson didnt immediately die
[3:35:02] <d3ltuhhh> @professionalwitchburner OMEGALUL
[3:35:08] <%Dakuu75> you're the protagonist now BITCH~!
[3:35:17] <captain_kirkhammer> @Bluwizard21 I thought you said Psycho Mantis and that was a lot better
[3:35:17] <+dd44dostivei> why is she the same age as her dad
[3:35:20] <jtsoppy137> wut
[3:35:20] <%ThomasOfTroy> FEEEEEEEELINGS
[3:35:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> booooo
[3:35:24] <cpt_langosta> that stinky, stinky darkness!
[3:35:25] <+cermo55> DARKNESSSSSSS
[3:35:27] <%DrTomT18> David Cage, get out of the writers room!
[3:35:30] <%sund0wner> Vomit noise
[3:35:34] <TheAntiNihilist> EDGY
[3:35:36] <DatAsuna> Someone wrote that and was like "hah, great line"
[3:35:37] <lloyddboy> my daddy told me not to be ashamed of our darkness
[3:35:37] <%Profmcstevie> Sora.....fuck the darkness
[3:35:37] <%jackelzxaa> but the emotions though
[3:35:40] <%professionalwitchburner> CAN'T YOU TELL BY MY EMOTIONS???!!
[3:35:40] <d3ltuhhh> for future reference: STOP ASKING HOW PEOPLE ARE DOING
[3:35:41] <%BlackStarAura> CHAOS
[3:35:42] <KnivesEve> that was a line
[3:35:44] <blackjack8182> EMotions!!!!!
[3:35:44] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is literally David Cage writing
[3:35:46] <%barrakuta371> miyuuPuke1 miyuuPuke2 miyuuPuke3 miyuuWAH
[3:35:46] <%Mr_Pylon> I was born in the dark
[3:35:47] <%Dakuu75> light, light, darkness, heart, light dark
[3:35:47] <%Monkeyweed21> This is some Mide tier shit
[3:35:51] <%jackelzxaa> edi's ass is so huge
[3:35:52] <+dmbender> Man a lot of that Dialogue does not hold up
[3:35:53] <Sp3ctre48> dlc ncp leave REEEE
[3:35:54] <%animaturgy> are you saying booo-urns?
[3:35:56] <blackjack8182> CHAOS
[3:35:58] <%jackelzxaa> she could kill a reaper with it
[3:36:02] <Archmortal> @DrTomT18 you know... I don't think it's THAT bad, but it's close
[3:36:09] <DatAsuna> yuuup
[3:36:12] <peyodogo> @peyodogo oh no no that's absolutely fair, i should've mentioned the manga too. it is also fair to mention that it's a totally different experience though
[3:36:14] <%jackelzxaa> get ready for walk and talk 2013 style
[3:36:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt this is Mide tier cringe
[3:36:30] <kingra> @barrakuta371 Is the character puking or being hit by puke?
[3:36:41] <%polothegreatest> 5 days remaining for DISSAPOINTMENT LUL
[3:36:49] <%DrTomT18> that's just telepathy with extra steps!
[3:36:54] <%akscully> reverse the polarity
[3:36:56] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[3:36:56] <akitanito> but biotics
[3:37:01] <%castlerock42> Her being telepathic would have been easier.
[3:37:03] <Laecerelius> Telepathy isn't real but anyway, this is how they do telepathy
[3:37:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Quantum entanglement is a real thing though
[3:37:04] <captain_kirkhammer> In a universe where c isn'
[3:37:06] <jtsoppy137> high level science eh
[3:37:06] <%king_wragles> But quantum is a longer word than magic
[3:37:08] <Moffin23> Biotics are space spice
[3:37:08] <scrumbotime> "There's no telepathy, they can just speak to your mind directly"
[3:37:09] <+jojo_abob> asari have borderline telepathy
[3:37:10] <Sp3ctre48> We KNOW Reapers can brainwash you though
[3:37:10] <%BlackStarAura> cross the streams
[3:37:10] <Dunmarkh> so telepathy
[3:37:11] <%machshop> can't asari literally read your mind
[3:37:13] <%professionalwitchburner> Magic isn't real, she says to a BIOTIC
[3:37:13] <cpt_langosta> no shut up tho
[3:37:14] <falyden> it's future quantum tho
[3:37:14] <$Shaggy2124> Space magic explains logic awaaaay
[3:37:16] <+trizetacannon44> Javik is telepathic!!!
[3:37:17] <AluxStreams> wi-fi :)
[3:37:18] <d3ltuhhh> oh look it's cardboard cutout 2!
[3:37:18] <%dekkitout> Something something dark energy
[3:37:18] <%jtdobyns> isnt that technically telepathy
[3:37:19] <tanarath> Quantum
[3:37:20] <Moffin23> the fuck is James doing here?
[3:37:23] <DianaTheAscian> Is quantum even a real science word?
[3:37:24] <+cermo55> Then what do the Asari mind connect with?
[3:37:26] <%Rumbutt> Make a quantum vibrator
[3:37:27] <%DrTomT18> @machshop Among other things
[3:37:28] <jtsoppy137> random James
[3:37:31] <blackjack8182> Hi James
[3:37:32] <+SilverDevilfish> James you are the LEAST qualified for this
[3:37:33] <captain_kirkhammer> I want the next game to have Liara call out to you across time and space like Spock
[3:37:34] <$hattrick61> just answer every question with "mass effect"
[3:37:34] <Sp3ctre48> Don't touch the head James
[3:37:36] <%jackelzxaa> theres no such thing as magic, we just scientifically use blancholic particles and krimbo zipples to make hyper chunks that can create fire, lightning, or ice attacks
[3:37:36] <%BlackStarAura> TOUCH THE HEAD PAT
[3:37:36] <%Rumbutt> @DianaTheAscian yes
[3:37:37] <d3ltuhhh> @Moffin23 he just kinda shows up and pokes the head
[3:37:37] <%DrTomT18> @DianaTheAscian yes
[3:37:37] <lloyddboy> blussy isn't telepathic it just hit different
[3:37:43] <TheAntiNihilist> I just realized, wouldn't Pat LOVE bitch face Rin? she's like Super Asuka.
[3:37:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> the whole thing with quantum entanglement in reality though is that you can't get information from it anyway iirc
[3:37:44] <Laecerelius> I expected James to start poking the head
[3:37:45] <%dekkitout> Dr. James Vega in the house I huess
[3:37:51] <jtsoppy137> less than that really
[3:37:54] <DatAsuna> take your shirt off james
[3:37:54] <Laecerelius> UGH
[3:37:55] <%machshop> ...
[3:37:57] <%ErikFeral> Any technology advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic. Here's Some MAGIC.
[3:37:57] <%jackelzxaa> talk to james
[3:37:59] <peachy996> DADDDDY
[3:37:59] <@QueequegTheater> I fucking adore James being here and just going "Yo, this shit looks hype, let me get in on this"
[3:38:00] <Saffry_Ruzin> keep talking to James
[3:38:00] <%jackelzxaa> he's looking at the head
[3:38:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Fun fact we've done quantum entanglement experiments and it can transmit data to a degree
[3:38:03] <%professionalwitchburner> Telepathy doesn't exist *every Asari wants to know your current location*
[3:38:04] <%jackelzxaa> go to james
[3:38:04] <$hattrick61> blow up the head again
[3:38:06] <%afronooch> talk to james
[3:38:10] <%jackelzxaa> james first then ann
[3:38:12] <%BlackStarAura> get the head for the ship
[3:38:12] <$Teh_Un> @PatStaresAt If you talk to James enough, you can move the husk head to your ship
[3:38:13] <%jillyrancher> Go to head
[3:38:17] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt james first then ann
[3:38:18] <jtsoppy137> fuuuuckin big brain talk
[3:38:19] <@QueequegTheater> Talk to James so we don't have to talk to Ann

[3:39:28] <fetelgeuse> Ick.
[3:39:28] <jtsoppy137> did they get another one?

[3:39:30] <alwayspronking> LUL

[3:39:44] <wolfen091> stealing stuff from an active crime scene
[3:39:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kill me... "Later"
[3:39:45] <jtsoppy137> just a stock pile of husk heads?
[3:39:45] <%professionalwitchburner> ISN'T THAT A HUGE INDOCTRINATION THREAT THOUGH,  SHEPARD??
[3:39:46] <cpt_langosta> husk onahole
[3:39:46] <%castlerock42> James, you're great, but what the fuck?
[3:39:48] <akitanito> I feel sorry for the head after the green ending
[3:39:50] <%jtdobyns> I feel this part is a little dragged on
[3:39:56] <+Ropcord> now it gets to watch you bang tali later
[3:39:57] <%WeLucklessJacks> James, that's a living being.
[3:39:57] <%jackelzxaa> i like doing part of the renegade path on this one then pulling out at the last second
[3:39:59] <$Shaggy2124> "Maybe I can show you... EMBRACE ETERNITY!"
[3:39:59] <DatAsuna> just use the neck hole
[3:39:59] <secret_npc> Pat and chat: Did James improve this DLC?
[3:40:00] <lord_sykos> Oh god I hope you can see it in the background when you invite Tali up
[3:40:05] <%jackelzxaa> unique special interactions like that are neat
[3:40:05] <@Ranryu692> did somebody say Face/Off?
[3:40:09] <+cermo55> You can definetly get away with 1 interupt
[3:40:10] <%afronooch> yes
[3:40:10] <d3ltuhhh> @akitanito LUL
[3:40:13] <%studleydoorite> her father was murdered?? D:
[3:40:19] <DatAsuna> no, nobody said face/off
[3:40:22] <%professionalwitchburner> @secret_npc Hell yes
[3:40:23] <%InternetShis> Shoot your own Face/Off
[3:40:28] <%jackelzxaa> big puggers covered in slime
[3:40:30] <jtsoppy137> james is real strong
[3:40:31] <%BlackStarAura> she's pretty fucking stupid for a scientist
[3:40:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Just suplex her James
[3:40:36] <KnivesEve> other than that dumb line she said earlier, why does pat hate this character?
[3:40:37] <secret_npc> Don't be a pussy, Pat
[3:40:39] <Dunmarkh> James is here to tackle her
[3:40:42] <cpt_langosta> she's already got a taste
[3:40:43] <+SmigGames> don't ask questions, Pat
[3:40:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Exposure?
[3:40:44] <mr_saturday93> NO SHUT UP
[3:40:45] <%machshop> because she's already indoctrinated i guess
[3:40:45] <%bevyrage> because she's been the most exposed to it pat
[3:40:45] <%StaceMcGate> because plot convience
[3:40:47] <+cermo55> she has most exposure
[3:40:48] <bear_breaker20> cause shes the key to all of this
[3:40:48] <$Shaggy2124> Because reasons
[3:40:48] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt because indoctrination takes time to take, pat
[3:40:49] <@Ranryu692> she's already been indoctrinated?
[3:40:49] <%king_wragles> Leviathan then attaches to the husk head to fuck with them
[3:40:50] <DatAsuna> because she's not a main character
[3:40:50] <wolfen091> because
[3:40:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cuz it already did it with her, idk man
[3:40:52] <%Monkeyweed21> it takes time
[3:40:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> because she's already indoctrinating
[3:40:54] <TioXyco> because nobody else had contact with the artefact
[3:40:55] <kingra> James is connected now NotLikeThis
[3:40:56] <peachy996> Because one's a meathead, one's a robot and you're you
[3:40:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> from exposure
[3:40:58] <%InternetShis> She was already connectedx
[3:40:58] <secret_npc> Don't puss out
[3:40:59] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt you can't flash indoctrinate people
[3:41:00] <Laecerelius> Yes, James, give her a massage
[3:41:01] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> She's been around those artifacts longer.
[3:41:03] <%dekkitout> Jimmy is too dumb, EDI is a sexbot, and Shep's a borg
[3:41:03] <tanarath> body massage
[3:41:03] <%cooldude69xx> She's the only one exposed to Leviathan juice
[3:41:04] <cpt_langosta> maybe she got a little wiff of it before
[3:41:04] <@Spydurman> cause she's already indoctrinated
[3:41:08] <+cermo55> weakest link
[3:41:09] <%machshop> LUL
[3:41:11] <%sunsetdisc0> you gotta spend a lot of time around it for it to get its hooks in ya
[3:41:15] <Sp3ctre48> Indoctrination never has consistent rules
[3:41:17] <%afronooch> shes shucking and jivin
[3:41:19] <DatAsuna> paranormal actvivity 3
[3:41:22] <%SovPho> good voice acting right
[3:41:23] <secret_npc> keep it going baby
[3:41:25] <%Bluwizard21> yes use the seer to summon the demon, i mean lady and reaper
[3:41:29] <%jackelzxaa> james is having trouble keeping this 110 pound woman under control
[3:41:29] <@Spydurman> that was the only line read we had
[3:41:30] <godzookylives> her voice acting...oof
[3:41:33] <akitanito> she's totally going to break her shoulders
[3:41:35] <d3ltuhhh> OH BOY THE HARVEST
[3:41:36] <%jackelzxaa> she's too powerful
[3:41:38] <%studleydoorite> does her voice get really hoarse after one of these episodes
[3:41:40] <CrypticMochi> Taking time was always the rule though
[3:41:42] <TioXyco> THERE'S NO WAR IN BA-SIN-SE
[3:41:45] <RyuuAoi> This bitch dumb
[3:41:46] <%Bluwizard21> there is no dana only zuul
[3:41:49] <%BlackStarAura> THERE IS ONLY ZOOL
[3:41:49] <+dd44dostivei> there is no dana
[3:41:50] <%AncelDeLambert> how many million of years? Just sitting in a hole, pretending to be deep
[3:41:59] <+paynexkiller> Psh, why wouldn't get you get more information.
[3:42:01] <cpt_langosta> darkness.... smelled like darkness...
[3:42:01] <+cermo55> i got an interupt
[3:42:05] <%professionalwitchburner> ...imprisoning me..
[3:42:05] <+paynexkiller> Why show weaknes Pat.
[3:42:05] <%DrTomT18> you can absolutely kill her here
[3:42:07] <%StaceMcGate> Darkness within Darkness
[3:42:15] <arizenarkana> THE LEAGUE OF DARKNESS?
[3:42:18] <%jillyrancher> DANKNESS
[3:42:18] <@QueequegTheater> @cermo55 You were probably more renegade than Pat
[3:42:20] <DatAsuna> more scanning
[3:42:21] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt if you go full renegade you can actually fry her brain and she becomes a drooler
[3:42:23] <GameOver_Here> DARKNESS IMPRISIONING ME ALL THAT I SEE ABSOLUTE DLC
[3:42:28] <DatAsuna> duh
[3:42:34] <Archmortal> that happens a lot with those numbers
[3:42:40] <+cermo55> @QueequegTheater hardly
[3:42:42] <+SmigGames> everything wants to kill you
[3:42:49] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, you can get way more if you do the renegade
[3:42:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is it about sitting in a hole for 10,000 years that turns dark god like beings into total edgelords pretending to be deep
[3:43:00] <%jtdobyns> I feel this DLC is longer then needs to be.
[3:43:07] <%jillyrancher> it's really not hard to find
[3:43:18] <%StaceMcGate> they are really fond of scanning planets as a game mechanic in ME3
[3:43:18] <%thedankestmeeme> dude pat im playing no more heros and idk how to use my food in battle sadge
[3:43:28] <%sunsetdisc0> pats gonna have to scan those other planets for their assets anyway
[3:43:29] <@QueequegTheater> @doc_ock_rokc After 8000 years a copy of Hybrid Theory starts spontaneously playing in their solitude
[3:43:32] <DatAsuna> @doc_ock_rokc Nothing, but reapers were always written like edgelords too, just look at ME2 harbinger
[3:43:36] <DatAsuna> omega cringe
[3:43:37] <%GuilKato> fire your scanning probes directly into the leviatahn
[3:43:51] <%dekkitout> @doc_ock_rokc I'd be pretty salty if I missed 10,000 years of whatever the reapers have equivalent to memes
[3:43:51] <%jillyrancher> The planet you want is a water world
[3:43:52] <%afronooch> hmmmm
[3:43:59] <Archmortal> go to these locations three to find your goal
[3:44:07] <DatAsuna> Sovereigns speech in ME1 is actually pretty terrible now when you go back and see he's saying nothing at all.
[3:44:11] <TioXyco> no leviathan in the fart ball
[3:44:11] <%Profmcstevie> Can you even....be physically ON a gas giant, it's just gas
[3:44:16] <%Monkeyweed21> LEVIATHAN LEVIATHAN
[3:44:21] <RyuuAoi> Pat, remember that Goku grandma scream you and Woolie used to do back in the day? Did it in the "I Have No Mouth" LP for sure. You guys gotta bring that back. It's gold ha
[3:44:23] <d3ltuhhh> hey look, we can feed garrus now
[3:44:24] <+ALazo> garrus can finally eat
[3:44:27] <akitanito> are you sure that's safe to teat
[3:44:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout they are immortal 10,000 years is like a penny to them
[3:44:43] <DatAsuna> Sovereign has what I call the Ada Wong effect of "there's a big mystery but we haven't bothered writing what it is yet"
[3:44:46] <%bevyrage> @Profmcstevie being classified as 'on a planet' actually means 'in the atmosphere of the planet'
[3:44:47] <DSD24> and not a 2B type
[3:44:58] <%Profmcstevie> Ah I see
[3:45:01] <lloyddboy> like trying to converse with an answering machine
[3:45:01] <captain_kirkhammer> You try living in dark space for a million years, you'd stop thinking too
[3:45:03] <%bevyrage> if it happens to have one*
[3:45:03] <secret_npc> This planet you're coming up to is like, top 5 favourite planets in the series
[3:45:04] <%ape_hawk> Sovereign just won a bunch of Intimidation checks against the players at the time
[3:45:06] <DatAsuna> "Who is Ada working for?" "We'll write that later"
[3:45:11] <%Monkeyweed21> they're just Geth with organics instead of VI processes
[3:45:11] <DSD24> Its a well written nothign speech
[3:45:13] <%jillyrancher> he was always just using big words to say "We gonna kill ypu"
[3:45:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Reapers are stuck Reaper 98
[3:45:33] <Moffin23> no thoughts in their heads? just gotta harvest and vibe
[3:45:34] <captain_kirkhammer> Little miss Mophet sat on Psi Tophet
[3:45:35] <TioXyco> side tophe?
[3:45:39] <+vaderxyz1970> running
[3:45:43] <Ekaelis> Well, it wasn't as simple as we kill you
[3:45:46] <jtsoppy137> water world
[3:45:54] <secret_npc> Yesss this planet fucking rules
[3:46:00] <secret_npc> Garrus and James
[3:46:10] <RyuuAoi> @jtsoppy137 They are remaking that.
[3:46:10] <%DrTomT18> you should read the description
[3:46:12] <%ape_hawk> can a water planet even exist that close to a sun?
[3:46:12] <Ekaelis> @DSD24 The You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it is still great
[3:46:14] <teefpal> Oh damn I didnt miss the stream!
[3:46:15] <secret_npc> oh well
[3:46:30] <cpt_langosta> SR388... LV-426...
[3:46:37] <V0LK__> it still baffles me that leviathan was dlc, WTF
[3:46:39] <%jackelzxaa> even steve gets to be in the dlc
[3:46:42] <akitanito> was cortez's chin flashing
[3:46:42] <@QueequegTheater> @ape_hawk depends on the sun
[3:46:52] <%cooldude69xx> Don't know how much you know about ancient, ancient greek myths, but Despoina is serious shit. She's like super hades
[3:46:53] <captain_kirkhammer> @ape_hawk depends on the kinda star it is. Red dwarf? Yes, ion fact peak universal habitability happens during the Red Sun Epoch
[3:46:53] <motoko__k> naroDance
[3:47:03] <RyuuAoi> Nice Daft Punk helmet though.
[3:47:11] <%dekkitout> Is the space squid really on the ocean planet? In the dlc called Leviathan?
[3:47:12] <DSD24> @Ekaelis No one can hate on that part its too good
[3:47:15] <Sp3ctre48> This plan is kinda silly honestly
[3:47:18] <%ape_hawk> @ape_hawk hmm, thanks for the info!
[3:47:22] <jtsoppy137> Under da sea
[3:47:26] <%jackelzxaa> finally the best part of the mission
[3:47:28] <+Kodkiro> oh like star wars
[3:47:30] <akitanito> oh no underwater mission
[3:47:31] <DSD24> Hey its that planet from the Last Jedi
[3:47:34] <%Profmcstevie> Cool, ocean planets
[3:47:39] <%Dakuu75> why did we get 3 seconds of high-res CG?
[3:47:39] <DatAsuna> I'm gonna pretend rise of skywalker ripped this off
[3:47:42] <%jillyrancher> Big Lovecraft
[3:47:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cooldude69xx I thought Despoina was another name for afroditie?
[3:47:45] <teefpal> @dekkitout I know writers who use subtlety and they're all cowards
[3:47:52] <%thebeargoesHONK> and you could have been hitting that by now...
[3:47:52] <cpt_langosta> purple beams! they detected us using their gaydar!
[3:47:53] <jtsoppy137> my name is Carlos sir Kappa
[3:47:55] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Leviathan should've protected its online security with nordvpn, use code REAPER to get 20% off
[3:47:59] <%jillyrancher> Space monster who lives underwater
[3:48:04] <%cooldude69xx> @dekkitout Did you want the space squid to be in a desert?
[3:48:05] <captain_kirkhammer> @cooldude69xx Jusr scanning the wikipedai she seems like a precursor to Hecate
[3:48:06] <+cermo55> super EMPs, not Steve's fault this time
[3:48:09] <%jtdobyns> STeves not doing very good this dlc
[3:48:12] <%thedankestmeeme> GODDAMNIT CORTEZ
[3:48:12] <Archmortal> the shuttle crashlands better than it flies tbh
[3:48:15] <peachy996> they should be dead. there was no possible way they could brace for impact in time
[3:48:18] <+JJMR322> ScaredyCat
[3:48:20] <secret_npc> Shipwreck planet
[3:48:20] <%jillyrancher> This looks great tho
[3:48:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> ??
[3:48:24] <%Faustgesicht> ATTON
[3:48:25] <%Axellogic> Would you threesome with Tali and Garrus?
[3:48:26] <%afronooch> pretty much
[3:48:26] <Ekaelis> @DSD24 I guess it's just ME3 failed to capitalize on that.
[3:48:28] <jtsoppy137> yeah pritty much
[3:48:28] <%Rumbutt> fuck you're right
[3:48:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DatAsuna Knowing Abrims and Johnson...yeah they probably did
[3:48:28] <%jackelzxaa> the star forge?
[3:48:33] <peachy996> Especially with the cyborg the thorny alien and the fragile woman in a suit
[3:48:33] <GameOver_Here> I have a phobia of the ocean and this part of the game freaked me out.
[3:48:33] <teefpal> ???
[3:48:33] <%professionalwitchburner> SITH DAGGER IN THE TENT
[3:48:34] <%Monkeyweed21> ATTON
[3:48:36] <%jackelzxaa> pat's almost max level
[3:48:37] <%cooldude69xx> @doc_ock_rokc Old, old name for the same goddess as persephone
[3:48:37] <%PunchSlugfest> the planet you crash on near the star forge sure
[3:48:39] <%critikal_bit> That guy's name was Atton!

[3:48:45] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[3:48:51] <%studleydoorite> LITERALLY star forge adjacent
[3:48:52] <DatAsuna> rakata prime
[3:48:54] <@Ranryu692> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!" - Bioware, probably
[3:48:56] <Ekaelis> Or a Bermuda triangle of ME3
[3:48:57] <akitanito> where's malak
[3:49:03] <Archmortal> 14 months.  No time for new ideas
[3:49:08] <DatAsuna> They also reused the ship graveyard idea in ME2
[3:49:10] <%WeLucklessJacks> Love the water planet in a storm.
[3:49:11] <DatAsuna> and then again in swtor
[3:49:21] <secret_npc> You can shoot the orbs I think
[3:49:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> space squid eggs
[3:49:24] <secret_npc> Yep
[3:49:26] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt shepard is holding his gun at a resting posture right now.  Alot of people were upset that there was no gun holster button in 3
[3:49:30] <%dekkitout> Oh man, is Shep gonna pull a kotor 2 Revan and go uber heel
[3:49:33] <%afronooch> no more orb on orb violence :(
[3:49:34] <captain_kirkhammer> It's a really cool set p[iece, I super don't mind it being constantrly used
[3:49:35] <jtsoppy137> woudnt be the first time
[3:49:35] <%DrTomT18> like a hero
[3:49:36] <cpt_langosta> shoot all the hitler balls, it's fine
[3:49:39] <teefpal> Ship graveyards were a thing before Bioware
[3:49:40] <@QueequegTheater> D:
[3:49:45] <Moffin23> better you break it than it ending up in the British Museum
[3:49:50] <+Ropcord> [liara screaming in the distance]
[3:49:58] <%jillyrancher> lol
[3:50:01] <jtsoppy137> Pratt....
[3:50:01] <teefpal> Im digging the vibes of this level
[3:50:12] <%Profmcstevie> Liara clutching her chest at every artifact shot
[3:50:30] <teefpal> The great great grandson of world famous va of Mario?
[3:50:36] <%DrTomT18> good times were had by all
[3:50:40] <godzookylives> Metal
[3:50:40] <DatAsuna> I knew someone called camacho and they were a bitch
[3:50:49] <+squeejiro> Itchy tasty time
[3:50:55] <%jillyrancher> Grim
[3:50:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> Why is it that cannibals always write journals in video game settings
[3:51:02] <%DrTomT18> I never got why Shepard didn't take an ATLUS he stole with him
[3:51:05] <DSD24> That looks silly
[3:51:07] <%Rumbutt> BRAAAAPPPPPPP
[3:51:07] <%BlackStarAura> chaos
[3:51:12] <%jackelzxaa> liara's character comes off as so much colder and antisocial if you aren't romancing her.  she's the only romance partner that gets much worse to hang out with if you aren't romancing her
[3:51:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stupid
[3:51:18] <%InternetShis> BRAAAAAAP
[3:51:18] <@QueequegTheater> Wait Pat did you not bring Javik and Liara LUL
[3:51:19] <%afronooch> the way that reaper drops in makes me giggle everytime
[3:51:20] <AngryAsian5> BWAAAAAA
[3:51:21] <RyuuAoi> Of corse you can't pilot the mech.
[3:51:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> It should come in on fire then fire guys down
[3:51:28] <+SmigGames> it's dlc reaper
[3:51:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> I don't even know anyone who writes a journal but I guess cannibals are all about that
[3:51:28] <Ekaelis> I guess it's staying out of range of that pulse
[3:51:30] <%jillyrancher> WEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:51:39] <cpt_langosta> why not fire its primary red beam? y'know, the one that kills cities?
[3:51:40] <ExpressNode> Wow this planet does remind me of star wars
[3:51:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Its not gonna fly near the reaper killer's EMP pulse
[3:51:49] <%BlackStarAura> poor garrus
[3:51:51] <@ssjklyco> where's the pulse that shot you down to shoot that?
[3:51:55] <%DrTomT18> well, Mass Effect 1 established that Reapers can make really wild ass turns
[3:51:55] <%jackelzxaa> "Sorry garrus, all you turians look alike to me, no hard feelings?"
[3:52:07] <DSD24> Did Pat get instant killed yet
[3:52:09] <peachy996> Cuz reasons
[3:52:10] <Ekaelis> Out of range mayhaps?
[3:52:13] <jtsoppy137> uh..... idk
[3:52:17] <Archmortal> probably out of range
[3:52:18] <peachy996> Cuz Bioware Reasons
[3:52:18] <%jackelzxaa> there's actuallya reasno
[3:52:21] <wolfen091> cause it won't come back up, leviathan can kill it
[3:52:24] <Archmortal> the shuttle was way closer
[3:52:24] <%Monkeyweed21> its staying far away and dropping shit on you
[3:52:28] <%DrTomT18> cause its a Reaper or something idk
[3:52:30] <%cooldude69xx> It isnt as close as you were?
[3:52:31] <DatAsuna> Steve has plot armour
[3:52:37] <Shade075> its on cooldown
[3:52:42] <jtsoppy137> nice job cortez
[3:52:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jackelzxaa "Its good shepard, can't tell you the amount of times I mistaked you for a husk"
[3:52:57] <%thebeargoesHONK> maybe if you had banged him.  he'd crash less
[3:52:57] <akitanito> how does that shuttle even fly at this point
[3:53:00] <+SmigGames> steve isn't playing on baby mode
[3:53:02] <Archmortal> time to get James back into the pilot's seat, he only crashed it once
[3:53:03] <DatAsuna> Everyone but Thane isn't allowed to die unless it relates to a choice shepard made
[3:53:06] <+Ropcord> officially a worse pilot than james
[3:53:11] <%BlackStarAura> When is Cortez NOT in trouble
[3:53:13] <%komradedog> wait, what kinda of cannibals are these?
[3:53:14] <DSD24> It always bugged me that Steve doesn't have armor
[3:53:24] <DSD24> He should be wearing armor
[3:53:25] <%jackelzxaa> it's kinda funny to me how every single enemy in this game has a massive and super well defined ass
[3:53:29] <DatAsuna> See? That's proof narrative mode is canon
[3:53:33] <Jaysky> Everyone surrounding Shepard get the baby mode field of protection
[3:53:33] <%DrTomT18> @DatAsuna Legion always dies also
[3:53:37] <jtsoppy137> yeah MECH
[3:53:38] <%jackelzxaa> husks prove that every alien has fat buttcheeks
[3:53:42] <teefpal> @DSD24 Its to make him look less like a soldier
[3:53:50] <DianaTheAscian> MECH
[3:53:54] <+ScrapKingKeita> GET IN THE ROBOT SHEPARD
[3:53:54] <cpt_langosta> UNDERWATER REAPER GHOST BASE!?
[3:54:03] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna True but the circumstances of his death are conditonal. Since you can also blast him away with a shotgun
[3:54:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHEPARD'S SOUL CONFIRMED NOT FILLED WITH BITCH
[3:54:06] <%Monkeyweed21> OH GOD ITS THE UNDERWATER SECTION OF KOTOR
[3:54:10] <DSD24> @teefpal I see what you mean, but he should get cool pilot armor instead
[3:54:12] <%InternetShis> Military grade only means minimum safety standard cheap shit
[3:54:15] <%Profmcstevie> DIVING ON AN ALIEN PLANETS OCEAN YEAAHH
[3:54:22] <%professionalwitchburner> Oh more MP stuff

[3:54:27] <+aWanderingKaivo> Man its great that Cortez knows all this engineering trivia about this specific equipment
[3:54:35] <%twistedj3ster> why is your ass sparking?
[3:54:42] <%Profmcstevie> Exploring an alien ocean planet sounds fucking terrifying lets do it
[3:54:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Remember that Bit in KOTOR where it was about lovcraftian space aliens?
[3:55:09] <teefpal> I like how the ship is rotating slightly to give the illusion of ocean waves rocking the ship
[3:55:15] <captain_kirkhammer> @Profmcstevie I mean there is a whole game and a half about this which are very popular and critically acclaimed  Ecco the Dolphin
[3:55:19] <%DrTomT18> @Profmcstevie I played Subnautica, I know how scary it can be lmao
[3:55:25] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Super weapon when you get battery
[3:55:28] <DatAsuna> @doc_ock_rokc The rakata weren't that lovecraftian
[3:55:33] <DSD24> Triton Aim Down Sights
[3:55:42] <wolfen091> triton aids

[3:55:51] <%senfood> Shepradfall
[3:55:55] <%jackelzxaa> use that mech to kill these difficult narrative mode bosses
[3:55:59] <%dekkitout> Is this the only other mech section?
[3:56:03] <+SmigGames> you kill faster out of the mech
[3:56:03] <%king_wragles> Notice how the audio is already giving you water distortion
[3:56:09] <DSD24> Shepardfall 3
[3:56:10] <%jackelzxaa> imagine fighting all these big fat butts on insanity
[3:56:11] <jtsoppy137> why dont we use these in the war?
[3:56:13] <+Ropcord> *doink*
[3:56:16] <Archmortal> see the KOTOR diving suit would've been way more fun if we could shoot things with rockets
[3:56:23] <RyuuAoi> I wanna see the mech...go into the water!
[3:56:27] <%Monkeyweed21> good job garrus
[3:56:28] <%jillyrancher> @king_wragles All Atlas do that

[3:59:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> HE NEEDS TO AVOID THE BENDS
[3:59:39] <@QueequegTheater> I feel like 90% of this subplot's budget went to this environment
[3:59:42] <DatAsuna> Spoilers shepard actually drowns down here and there is no ending

[4:00:23] <DatAsuna> Pat's about to find the anthem of creation
[4:00:25] <%kyh9> Freaky
[4:00:29] <+Ropcord> man this caves and cliffs update looks great
[4:00:30] <arizenarkana> Visually this holds up really nicely.
[4:00:31] <%kyh9> Look at that glitching
[4:00:31] <tanarath> @queequegtheater mass effect is magic, so it's probably fucking with interior pressure so bends aren't an issue? best I can come up with
[4:00:37] <Vyskus> making shepherd do a captains log really saves on the VA don't it
[4:00:40] <%jackelzxaa> imagine if kai leng was just not in the game and instead this was
[4:00:41] <lloyddboy> ResidentSleeper
[4:00:45] <%Mekhet09> Almost time for one of the stupidest moments in mass effect history.
[4:00:52] <Moffin23> I swear this whole section use to be darker on 360
[4:00:55] <teefpal> This is pretty good for 360/ps3 tech
[4:00:56] <%tank7013> Hooooooo
[4:00:57] <%jackelzxaa> lets GO
[4:00:58] <$hattrick61> kai leng shows up in flippers and a snorkle
[4:00:59] <%jackelzxaa> satan
[4:01:00] <akitanito> could be methane
[4:01:03] <%tank7013> Biggboi
[4:01:05] <%BlackStarAura> big bitch
[4:01:08] <DSD24> Look how tiny Shepard is
[4:01:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> HOLY CRAP THATS ONE BIG CRAWDAD!
[4:01:08] <TioXyco> that's KAI LENG!
[4:01:08] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[4:01:08] <+dmbender> he seems upset
[4:01:10] <RyuuAoi> Yeah ocean sucks. We explore space but ocean still so unknown.
[4:01:11] <stoatacious> fuuuuuuucckkk this
[4:01:11] <+SmigGames> shoot it
[4:01:11] <+Redpointshine> There is no scarier setting in fiction than deep water
[4:01:13] <@Ranryu692> this is a really cool moment if you haven't been spoiled on it LUL
[4:01:13] <AngryAsian5> It's a squid
[4:01:15] <%jackelzxaa> hi cthulhu
[4:01:16] <wolfen091> @hattrick61 omg
[4:01:17] <%afronooch> hims large
[4:01:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> WE HAVING A BROIL TONIGHT
[4:01:17] <%Daxalog> Imagine if Kai Leng was down here. With no suit. Cause hes SOO COOLllll..!
[4:01:17] <Zombrocom> Hey buddy
[4:01:17] <%Faustgesicht> Hey stupid
[4:01:18] <%kyh9> THIS SHIT FREAKS ME OUT
[4:01:18] <DatAsuna> I wish shepard had the eye bug right now
[4:01:18] <%dekkitout> Wait it's an actual squid?
[4:01:20] <secret_npc> Out of context this is fuckin cool
[4:01:21] <AngryAsian5> It's a big ol squid
[4:01:22] <%tank7013> I guess they thought reapers weren't lovecraftian enough normally
[4:01:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> its an aboleth!
[4:01:25] <+cermo55> it is
[4:01:26] <teefpal> Time for the biggest ass covering in Mass Effect history\
[4:01:26] <mr_saturday93> I wonder how they fuck
[4:01:27] <%senfood> HAVE YOU MET MY SON KAI LENG? ISN'T HE SO COOL, COMMANDER?
[4:01:28] <%brisk_dacat> Look like Royal Ludroth
[4:01:30] <$realm_forge> ANDROSS
[4:01:31] <%ErikFeral> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[4:01:34] <DSD24> I love this conversation visually
[4:01:34] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Imagine if you made something this vital to the story into paid DLC hahahaha
[4:01:39] <RyuuAoi> I'd just die right there.
[4:01:40] <+cermo55> its not that dark in there
[4:01:41] <DatAsuna> The why is obvious shepard
[4:01:45] <%AncelDeLambert> this is SO GODDAMN STUPID
[4:01:45] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:53] <teefpal> @QueequegTheater It was made after the backlash
[4:01:57] <%dekkitout> Don't tell me the space squids built their own geth
[4:02:01] <%thebeargoesHONK> is this just a giant squid.  like the giant worm that killed a reaper?
[4:02:02] <peachy996> Wouldn't you be the echoes?
[4:02:06] <%studleydoorite> booo
[4:02:08] <@QueequegTheater> @teefpal And was still made into paid DLC
[4:02:08] <%DrTomT18> The Repears have, in theory, been looking for this dude for 14 billion years and Shepard found it in like 2 days
[4:02:10] <cpt_langosta> NOT TELEPATHY
[4:02:11] <%AncelDeLambert> the space squids built their own geth
[4:02:11] <+BananaSlammuh> @teefpal In what way exactly? I have my own issues with this but I'm curious
[4:02:11] <+Canti510> Canti510 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[4:02:13] <%Mekhet09> I hate this so much.
[4:02:13] <@ssjklyco> Is he a Pro-Prothean?
[4:02:14] <%jackelzxaa> this part rules
[4:02:15] <DianaTheAscian> Bigger reapers?
[4:02:16] <%Profmcstevie> Get out of my brain loser
[4:02:18] <DatAsuna> Echo means strand
[4:02:22] <%studleydoorite> "something more" fuckin c'mon
[4:02:27] <%kyh9> Full indoctrination
[4:02:28] <Them00n> I still think this DLC makes the ending worse.
[4:02:29] <%machshop> why are you this lady though
[4:02:34] <%jackelzxaa> this is actually just a better version of starchild
[4:02:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> THESE ARE THE BIOLOGICAL REAPERS
[4:02:48] <$lotharrio> "Cause we are big bitch babies."
[4:03:00] <RyuuAoi> Wtf
[4:03:01] <DatAsuna> your plot dick is too big
[4:03:06] <+wumpy3d> this is kinda like ds9
[4:03:07] <%afronooch> @Them00n 100%
[4:03:08] <ThatGuyThere03> BOOOOO GO BACK TO THE SQUID
[4:03:10] <peachy996> You are super speccial
[4:03:12] <%tank7013> This is actually kinda neat on paper
[4:03:13] <%polothegreatest> you are the chosen one...
[4:03:15] <Dunmarkh> Man remember the wormhole aliens from ds9?
[4:03:16] <kingra> Cycle nonsense
[4:03:19] <Them00n> Your dick is so big Shepard.
[4:03:22] <Jaysky> Just a bit of blood
[4:03:22] <Sp3ctre48> The Collectors are still around though
[4:03:23] <peachy996> you're the biggest most special ever
[4:03:27] <DSD24> The nose bleed
[4:03:31] <%bread_assassin> Sovereign is not it's real name so why'd he call him that.
[4:03:37] <DatAsuna> This is actually why Leviathans are a problem
[4:03:41] <%kyh9> HARDCORE INDOCTRINATION
[4:03:41] <Vakojin> "We created our own tractors : the reapers"
[4:03:41] <%jackelzxaa> imagine being casey hudson and saying "let's not put this in the game"
[4:03:42] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz it wasn't enough for the Protheans to be slavers, the original Reapers had to be, too
[4:03:44] <%studleydoorite> why am I thinking of Metamoq in Zeno Clash
[4:03:52] <@Ranryu692> @bread_assassin Shepard's memories are shaping the interaction
[4:03:53] <%DrTomT18> @bread_assassin Shepards mind gives voice to their words
[4:03:53] <Jaysky> @bread_assassin Because that's as Shepard knows him as I'd assume
[4:03:56] <DSD24> Yo dog
[4:04:01] <Shade075> If these guys think your dick is so huge wait till they see Kai "Cereal Killer" Leng!
[4:04:01] <+Kodkiro> freaking ai
[4:04:01] <jtsoppy137> yeah they made the reapers
[4:04:03] <teefpal> @studleydoorite because you have good taste
[4:04:06] <%dekkitout> R u fking 4 reel tajWHY
[4:04:06] <+SilverDevilfish> This feels very Deep Space Nine
[4:04:06] <+SmigGames> "at any cost" was a mistake
[4:04:10] <+cermo55> should have been more specific
[4:04:12] <DatAsuna> "machines kept killing organics so we made a machine to stop that"
[4:04:13] <%Monkeyweed21> We tried to solve Skynet with Galactic Skynet
[4:04:16] <%dekkitout> They built their own geth
[4:04:17] <DSD24> We created machines to save life to destroy life
[4:04:22] <+ALazo> Machines were killing stuff, so we made machines to stop that\
[4:04:26] <%StaceMcGate> BOOOOOOOOOO
[4:04:27] <captain_kirkhammer> @AncelDeLambert Do you mean slaver slavewr or Larry Niven Slaver because the Leviathans are basically ripped straight from Known Space
[4:04:28] <%barrakuta371> ooops
[4:04:29] <%miguelrod777> the first geth
[4:04:31] <%senfood> For a super smart, apex race they sure as fucking dumb as everyone else. Jesus.
[4:04:32] <V0LK__> CRUCIAL PLOT ON THE DLC!!!!
[4:04:33] <%tank7013> That's stupid. They're stupid
[4:04:33] <%studleydoorite> @teefpal thanks I like your name
[4:04:33] <%Rumbutt> this is so stupid
[4:04:34] <Sp3ctre48> wow it would be cool if that Harbinger guy was in this game
[4:04:36] <+cermo55> you killed the first one
[4:04:37] <%ape_hawk> THEY FUCKING SKYNETTED THEMSELVES
[4:04:42] <red_blaster> They're trying really hard to make it less stupid than it was originally
[4:04:44] <%Mekhet09> This is stupid.
[4:04:45] <%afronooch> yep
[4:04:46] <AngryAsian5> So Skynet
[4:04:46] <DatAsuna> It's less out of the blue but that's about it
[4:04:46] <digaogrunge> THIS WAS NOT IN THE BASE GAME
[4:04:49] <mr_saturday93> @alazo really stupid isn't it?
[4:04:50] <%AncelDeLambert> they're pretty stupid
[4:04:51] <%InternetShis> SQUID SKYNET
[4:04:52] <kingra> Super stupid
[4:04:52] <%kyh9> DONT YOU LOVE PLOT IMPORTANT DLC
[4:04:53] <RyuuAoi> Crucible. For Halo sake
[4:04:53] <DSD24> "We made it bad on purpose as a joke"
[4:04:54] <%polothegreatest> well terminator it is
[4:04:55] <metalsiren31> YEAH BASICALLY
[4:05:00] <%Monkeyweed21> They tried to solve Skynet with Big Skynet and it backfired
[4:05:01] <+Redpointshine> Giant Beholder Squids did a Terminator
[4:05:02] <%DrTomT18> @PatStaresAt you are basically dealing with a malfunctioning AI with the power of a God
[4:05:04] <%king_wragles> @InternetShis squidnet
[4:05:05] <$lotharrio> "We have a natural psychic ability... making us smarter than you. No shut up. NO! We're SMART!"
[4:05:06] <peachy996> A lot of work was put into making the ending less shit
[4:05:08] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, this is all idiotic and evidence of a WEIRD interest by EA in Space Cthulus
[4:05:09] <teefpal> They're trying to patch up the ending
[4:05:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS WAS ADDED AFTERWARDS
[4:05:14] <Ekaelis> Okay, you dont wan't to have a reaction to the biggest bomb revealed in universe be "You guys are idiots"
[4:05:14] <%Mekhet09> This is just stupid even if you like it though.
[4:05:15] <DatAsuna> a good question
[4:05:16] <captain_kirkhammer> "The Precursors are actually stupid" is a time-honored sci-fi cliche
[4:05:16] <Samaugsch2> They really should‚Äôve stuck with the dark matter ending
[4:05:16] <%dekkitout> How did this shit not get past the noise of people hating me3's ending?
[4:05:17] <DatAsuna> a bad answer
[4:05:18] <%jackelzxaa> this not being in the base game is ALL casey hudson's fault.
[4:05:19] <%senfood> "THE LESSER RACES KEEP GETTING SKYNETTED. WE SHOULD MAKE A NEW AI TO KEEP THEM SAFE IT TOTALLY WON'T HAPPEN TO US."
[4:05:19] <peachy996> Imagine how much work it took to save the ending
[4:05:27] <+ALazo> they all sucked, we could do it better
[4:05:31] <%kyh9> "QUICK, DLC AND FIX THE ENDING WITH DLC"
[4:05:33] <%Faustgesicht> Let's design killer robots to kill people when they design killer robots. fucking stupid
[4:05:33] <DatAsuna> @Samaugsch2 It was never a real ending
[4:05:36] <GandhiTheTerrible> Repeat after me, "FUCK CASEY HUDSON"
[4:05:44] <%jackelzxaa> "The precursors didn't realise the ants were actually valid"
[4:05:44] <willsin4fun> did these space squid crab lobster monsters somehow make some machines; how did they like, put pieces of things together, & did they have like, resource miners & stuff?
[4:05:46] <@ssjklyco> So it's a failed attempt to keep a time capsule of life?
[4:05:47] <%InternetShis> "We're too big to fail"
[4:05:48] <%bahookery> this was 6 months later lmao
[4:05:49] <%jillyrancher> nah
[4:05:50] <tanarath> I feel like Bioware was just fucking D O N E with ME at the end of 3,so they just released it as good enough.
[4:05:50] <%KyJackshot> It might make the ending make a bit more sense but ruins the reapers as cool unknown force.
[4:05:52] <Moffin23> doubling down on your bad decisions
[4:05:55] <jtsoppy137> a kill all reapers button would be a nice ending as simple as that is
[4:05:55] <%tank7013> Literally "Nah they didn't win"
[4:05:55] <+SmigGames> if you're almost exterminated, it was a mistake
[4:05:58] <kingra> I-IT WASN'T A MISTAKE BabyRage
[4:06:01] <%komradedog> Ah, i love plot points from 80s manga
[4:06:10] <%dekkitout> This is not the same as Getter Emperor/Anti Spiral
[4:06:10] <%InternetShis> I'M NOT OWNED
[4:06:11] <%AncelDeLambert> AncelDeLambert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 3, what is it with EA and 3 and Space Cthulus?
[4:06:13] <$lotharrio> @willsin4fun They used their natural psychic powers to mind control people into making machines for them.
[4:06:13] <%Mekhet09> Even with this DLC. This is still entirely stupid though.
[4:06:22] <jtsoppy137> Space illuminati
[4:06:28] <V0LK__> space palantirs!
[4:06:31] <%jackelzxaa> @tanarath it's more that ea was forcing them to release too soon and casey hudson was a terrible leader who made bad decisions
[4:06:32] <kingra> Yeah this is still stupid
[4:06:32] <mr_saturday93> I wonder if they shit those out literally
[4:06:34] <DatAsuna> @Samaugsch2 The source of that rumour was it being mentioned off hand on a white board and never developed because it has the huge plothole of the reapers forcing us to use eezo. So They would be forcing us to make the problem in the first place.
[4:06:40] <+SmigGames> you can only do so much to fix that ending
[4:06:40] <%senfood> Does anyone smell that odor coming from this apex lifeform? It smells like BITCH!
[4:06:47] <Zombrocom> They are trying really hard to unfuck the ending but it's too fucked to unfuck very far
[4:06:49] <%Canti510> @PatStaresAt If you don't play this DLC the Catalyst at the end just tells you "There is no time and you wouldn't understand the ones the created me"
[4:06:52] <%BlackStarAura> lol
[4:06:59] <$realm_forge> WE ARE BATMAN
[4:07:17] <%Piemono> I feel like having a scary deep voice vision is less effective then just using the VAs for the characters
[4:07:19] <%xcompleasedad> @Samaugsch2 I feel like the solution should be that the Reapers actively destroy entire galaxies to produce a McGuffin material
[4:07:22] <+Peacefrog7> LITTERALLY RETCONNING ME2
[4:07:23] <+D00msDayDan> rolling back the human reaper
[4:07:24] <DatAsuna> ! reaper per cycle is hyper inefficient
[4:07:26] <%Mekhet09> There should only be like 50 reapers then.
[4:07:29] <%jillyrancher> I like that they still kinda defend thier machine
[4:07:30] <@QueequegTheater> EXCEPT THAT ONE IN ME2 DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[4:07:31] <Sp3ctre48> It wasn't true before this game lol
[4:07:31] <%Faustgesicht> Except that human baby one.
[4:07:33] <Archmortal> it was for a really long time though
[4:07:33] <Tracazoid> So if they birth one Reaper, then didn't you already piss on their plan by killing the Terminator Reaper?
[4:07:35] <%polothegreatest> he meant ugly
[4:07:37] <%walternatorz> but why male reapers?
[4:07:38] <%InternetShis> Not canon, fuck you
[4:07:41] <%tank7013> That makes the human reaper even lamer because it means humans are so cool and strong they made a special one just for us
[4:07:42] <DSD24> Kill life to save life
[4:07:42] <teefpal> so these are just robot versions of these guys
[4:07:42] <PanicSwytch> But ME2 had human appearance
[4:07:44] <blackjack8182> Human reaper
[4:07:48] <tanarath> @jackelzxaa pat has said that Bioware chose to just release it despite an extra year being brought up by EA. Idk. Bioware magic is a thing, EA is garbage.
[4:07:50] <Moffin23> all reapers have the shell of a Harbringer, while I guess the organics they harvest lay inside, like robots pilotting mechs
[4:07:54] <ThatGuyThere03> are these 3 human analogues supposed to be people Shephard knows or...?
[4:07:56] <@QueequegTheater> @PanicSwytch "Shhh"
[4:07:59] <jtsoppy137> yeah..... no....
[4:08:01] <%AncelDeLambert> this is SO MONUMENTALLY STUPID
[4:08:01] <Archmortal> Shepard was the first person that ever caused ANY of this shit to be like "oh fuck, that one though"
[4:08:04] <DatAsuna> @Peacefrog7 TBF even in ME2 it was speculation, not hard fact and then ME2 showed a million harbinger looking reapers 15 minutes later
[4:08:12] <Sp3ctre48> The human reaper likely would have been the core of the squid ship
[4:08:16] <DSD24> @ThatGuyThere03 Shepard knows these people
[4:08:17] <TioXyco> man, imagine when Javik hears about this, he gonna be MAD
[4:08:18] <%jillyrancher> @tanarath That was Andromeda dude. not 3.
[4:08:23] <%afronooch> @ThatGuyThere03 yeah, all npcs from this dlc
[4:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> of course it hasn't been completed, it's nonsensicle
[4:08:33] <Zombrocom> As to the human reaper thing, apparently that's just the core. Supposedly every reaper has a big ol robot statue of the former race inside the big squid
[4:08:34] <%InternetShis> Guys, Mass Relays being Reaper tech is in MASS EFFECT ONE
[4:08:38] <CrypticMochi> I mean the human reaper is really small, it probably would be the core not the frame
[4:08:40] <@QueequegTheater> @ThatGuyThere03 They're the super cool OCs with hyper melodrama that you had to talk to for the first 70% of the DLC
[4:08:43] <%jillyrancher> I actually really like the idea of Leviathans
[4:08:43] <$lotharrio> Shoulda been a bunch of weird black robot skeletons in space instead of robo-squids.
[4:08:51] <metalsiren31> The idea that it's literally just running a lab experiment because it was given an impossible problem to solve is way better than "we kill you because if we didn't you'd die"
[4:08:58] <+Peacefrog7> @Mekhet09 more like 5000 maybe 50000 but that would be from the earliest times of the milky way
[4:08:59] <PinkSocks> "I was added months later i cant help that much"
[4:09:06] <%Mekhet09> THAT'S THE ENTIRE DLC.
[4:09:08] <%jillyrancher> I always assumed Reapers literally grow into the squid shape
[4:09:11] <ThatGuyThere03> @QueequegTheater I would rather stare at Liara or Garrus with this goofy monster voice
[4:09:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHOS TALKING
[4:09:17] <+Redpointshine> "Nothing will change"  O_O
[4:09:17] <Sp3ctre48> The human reaper is still the dumbest ever but that part of it has an explanation
[4:09:18] <tanarath> Oh really? @jillyrancher I need to get my head check then, I keep forgetting things.
[4:09:21] <@QueequegTheater> @ThatGuyThere03 me too
[4:09:22] <%tank7013> Now Shepard has to talk-no-jutsu an elder god
[4:09:22] <%GuilKato> it already has you had best buddy leigion
[4:09:36] <%jillyrancher> I like that they dont give a single shit about you or your problems lol
[4:09:41] <tanarath> Sorry for insinuating that it was Bioware for ME 3
[4:09:43] <%polothegreatest> its has no power here LUL
[4:09:46] <DSD24> Oooo thats bad
[4:09:46] <DatAsuna> Leviathans are a big problem because Shepard never actually convinces them to respect free will. Even if they beat the reapers, We MUST genocide the leviathans immediately after, they cannot be left alone. lol
[4:09:55] <%dekkitout> There's more?
[4:09:56] <%tank7013> Oh there's more?
[4:10:00] <%GuilKato> space cuttlefish!
[4:10:05] <cpt_langosta> three o dems
[4:10:06] <Archmortal> I like how Leviathan indoctrination works on Shepard even though Reaper indoctrination never did
[4:10:07] <tanarath> Oh yeah, they're completely self-serving.
[4:10:08] <Sorrowful_Suicide> I love these fishy creatures  hannahComfy
[4:10:19] <Zombrocom> To be fair, the leviathans have seen like a thousand civilizations die at this point
[4:10:23] <%tank7013> Wow that was so easy
[4:10:24] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[4:10:26] <teefpal> @DatAsuna dont worry they'll just go back into the ocean or something for me4
[4:10:26] <peachy996> I am their progeny oh and then there's these two guys two
[4:10:27] <+Peacefrog7> @PatStaresAt you know what this is... this is sisko in the wormhole...
[4:10:30] <%GuilKato> you are space cuttlefish you are not the apex species
[4:10:31] <DatAsuna> Literally saying they'll enslave us if we beat the reapers
[4:10:31] <Jaysky> Apex my ass you fucks are extinct
[4:10:31] <willsin4fun> @lotharrio I guess thats fair enough; but aren't they aquatic? Who did they mind control to do that; some alien fish boii's?
[4:10:32] <%xcompleasedad> @DatAsuna They are the Cthulus getting bodied by Skynet
[4:10:32] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Talk No Justu Working again
[4:10:33] <+cermo55> Javik is gonna love these guys
[4:10:36] <AngryAsian5> "Your dick is abnormally huge Shepard." LUL
[4:10:36] <%DrTomT18> These guys are totally gonna be the villains of Mass Effect 4
[4:10:37] <%Canti510> FUELED BY SPITE
[4:10:38] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:10:39] <mr_saturday93> the apex race that fucked over the entire galaxy
[4:10:40] <%jillyrancher> Leviathan enthrallment is much stronger I think
[4:10:40] <%GuilKato> handily theres like 3 of them
[4:10:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> @metalsiren31 Yeah I actually like that one, it sounds like something a super advanced runaway intelligence would do
[4:10:42] <%ThomasOfTroy> Hell yeah you will
[4:10:44] <%senfood> Yeah, gotta massacre these dudes.
[4:10:44] <%Mr_Pylon> talking big game for a people who got owned by the reapers
[4:10:45] <Them00n> Three space cuttlefish will help Shepard fight.
[4:10:46] <%GuilKato> blow up a star and you're fine
[4:10:47] <%tank7013> So is this a plot point they just ignore after the end?
[4:10:50] <Ekaelis> @Archmortal It might be just because of the proximity
[4:10:50] <tanarath> FUCK YEAH YOU WILL
[4:10:51] <+Ropcord> good luck with that
[4:10:54] <TioXyco> Reapers are machines, they have no blood, stupid bitch
[4:10:55] <peachy996> Pay no attention to those two other guys pay attention to ME I am the their progeny
[4:10:55] <psychoteletubby7> so, wouldnt the leviathans just take over after the end of the game?
[4:10:56] <%Mekhet09> Yeah basically.
[4:10:56] <DSD24> BOOST
[4:10:57] <%xcompleasedad> @Peacefrog7 So wait, does that mean he is a Leviathan baby?
[4:10:57] <+ALazo> nah, they seem rad
[4:10:59] <KnivesEve> they seem kinda bad
[4:10:59] <$lotharrio> @willsin4fun They aren't aquatic. They can live in space I think?
[4:11:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cermo55 Javik is 1000000% behind those guys
[4:11:01] <+SmigGames> ME4 is fighting leviathans
[4:11:01] <%WeLucklessJacks> Oh definitely.
[4:11:02] <%kyh9> This is a legitimately Faustian bargain
[4:11:02] <%Piemono> Ally with Hitler to defeat the School Bully!
[4:11:04] <DatAsuna> Give the GEth all the guns they need to kill the leviathans
[4:11:07] <@QueequegTheater> ROCKETO BOOSTO
[4:11:08] <%DrTomT18> @GuilKato It's never stated if there are more of them hidden around the galaxy. I assume there are.
[4:11:09] <%bevyrage> leviathan are pretty much the most boomer thinking you could get
[4:11:11] <DSD24> I like these loading screens
[4:11:12] <AngryAsian5> They seemed nice
[4:11:12] <Moffin23> here come the BENDS
[4:11:12] <leinadtonu> They are dangerously stupid.
[4:11:13] <GameOver_Here> That would of made a good Mass Effect 4 storyline
[4:11:14] <akitanito> what's decompression
[4:11:16] <robosqueeb> His fucking holo screen glitched out of the mech when he boosted LMAO
[4:11:16] <%kyh9> "How do you feel about Worlddomination?"
[4:11:16] <teefpal> eezo, probably
[4:11:17] <%professionalwitchburner> NOT THE BENDS
[4:11:18] <%Faustgesicht> Roboskeleton
[4:11:19] <%jackelzxaa> Mass Effect 5 will have to contend with the fact that leviathans exist
[4:11:19] <BeastlyWhale> they invented an anti bends buttplug
[4:11:19] <DatAsuna> mass effect mumbo jumbo
[4:11:21] <%WeLucklessJacks> These guys are definitely gonna want to make themselves the rulers of the universe again.
[4:11:22] <%king_wragles> It's pressurized... so I think it's fine?
[4:11:23] <Zombrocom> We could just get the geth to take them out
[4:11:24] <Jetsfantasy> Pressurized mech?
[4:11:26] <%Mekhet09> This dlc is dumb and you won't convince me other wise.
[4:11:26] <%walternatorz> mass effect field maintained your pressure
[4:11:26] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Yeah but it's either have them on board and more likely win now, or dont bother and lose more
[4:11:27] <peachy996> Oh the Brutes calmed down
[4:11:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, you were in a pressurized suit
[4:11:27] <%senfood> Shep's basically a cyborg. He'll be fine.
[4:11:27] <%kyh9> These assholes remind me of Queen
[4:11:27] <CrypticMochi> They made the problem and didn‚Äôt learn anything
[4:11:30] <%king_wragles> I still don't think it should stop it tho
[4:11:30] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt pressurized cockpit
[4:11:30] <Moffin23> oh no, there you are dying of the bends
[4:11:32] <haisho> yeah it's pressurized inside
[4:11:32] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Let's exterminate the rats by releasing snakes!
[4:11:32] <Sp3ctre48> Put the default guns away guns NotLikeThis
[4:11:34] <%jackelzxaa> tali was using an assault rifle
[4:11:34] <%mai_waifu_> no shut up it's space tech
[4:11:34] <%xcompleasedad> Wasn't he entirely encased in his own atmo?
[4:11:35] <%ElkRiverDog> I know these things are supposed to resemble cuttlefish, but all‚Äôs I see is giant ticks
[4:11:35] <cpt_langosta> the benz? what about the damler?
[4:11:35] <+D00msDayDan> You don‚Äôt get the bends in a pressurized compartment
[4:11:36] <Dunmarkh> Why the fuck would you get the bends in a pressurized capsule???
[4:11:36] <+squeejiro> Anti Radiohead technology
[4:11:38] <%professionalwitchburner> Anddd Shepard goes pop
[4:11:38] <akitanito> really shepard?
[4:11:38] <%jillyrancher> and deal with the problem later
[4:11:39] <metalsiren31> If the interior remains at 1 atmo of pressure you don't need decompression
[4:11:40] <DatAsuna> Genocide is literally the only option
[4:11:40] <$Shaggy2124> quantum depressurization?
[4:11:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As long as the cabin is pressurized he's fine
[4:11:45] <%DrTomT18> @kyh9 The band?
[4:11:45] <%jillyrancher> Desperate times
[4:11:45] <teefpal> At least theres only a few leviathans
[4:11:50] <%tank7013> Hey Garrus and Tali do literally anything
[4:11:51] <%dekkitout> Shep's tuckered out
[4:11:53] <%GhoulishCripple> can't that mech go into space? it's 100% pressurized
[4:11:56] <tanarath> @patstaresat mass effect fields fucking with density to fuck with pressure? idk
[4:11:57] <%tank7013> Or not
[4:11:57] <Minorou> goodoctrination!
[4:12:02] <%InternetShis> I'm gonna take a nap
[4:12:03] <%kyh9> @kyh9 The Deltarune character
[4:12:04] <cpt_langosta> remember guys, NOT TELEPATHY
[4:12:05] <%jackelzxaa> hi garrus
[4:12:06] <%GuilKato> cuttlefish signal is stronger than reaper signal for no adequately explained reason
[4:12:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Shep needs a nap
[4:12:07] <ThatGuyThere03> that
[4:12:08] <+SmigGames> how much brain damage did Shepard suffer from this
[4:12:08] <ThatGuyThere03> is not good
[4:12:09] <wolfen091> hug it out boys
[4:12:10] <%ThomasOfTroy> SHUT UP
[4:12:10] <%ape_hawk> OH NO, THE LEVIATHEN JUST POSTED CRINGE IN THE REAPER'S BRAINS
[4:12:10] <%afronooch> too ez
[4:12:11] <Zombrocom> Yeah that is one OP mind control power
[4:12:11] <%ErikFeral> psaCrazy
[4:12:12] <Jaysky> That'd be too much
[4:12:13] <%afronooch> not rad
[4:12:15] <Moffin23> this is more cinematic
[4:12:15] <Sp3ctre48> Shut up
[4:12:16] <%InternetShis> Look at that in-engine FMV render
[4:12:16] <%SinnerEbru> fuck you
[4:12:16] <Jetsfantasy> Proximity to shepard perhaps
[4:12:17] <fetelgeuse> Party aren't allowed to be useful in a cutscene.
[4:12:17] <%professionalwitchburner> Because making toys fight is fun
[4:12:18] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt but punch fight!
[4:12:18] <peachy996> there's only 3 shut up
[4:12:19] <+Peacefrog7> or just control the big reapers????? @PatStaresAt
[4:12:20] <@QueequegTheater> This is cooler
[4:12:20] <$lotharrio> Because it's fine, Pat.
[4:12:20] <+BananaSlammuh> It's cooler to see one box another onxe
[4:12:21] <Sp3ctre48> There's no time
[4:12:22] <%Profmcstevie> Why waste brain energy
[4:12:22] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not as fun
[4:12:22] <%Ynkubus_> shhhh
[4:12:23] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Wololo!
[4:12:24] <%DrTomT18> So yeah, there is your Mass Effect 4 villain. Calling it right now.
[4:12:24] <AngryAsian5> They chose violence
[4:12:26] <%Mekhet09> If they can control them then why can't they just control the reapers into killing themselves.
[4:12:29] <%xcompleasedad> They want to kill
[4:12:33] <akitanito> that husk hanging on the side
[4:12:34] <%xcompleasedad> And smash
[4:12:35] <+SilverDevilfish> Wait can Tali even use an AR
[4:12:39] <%afronooch> the quick shit frpm 2021 graphics to 2012 graphics LUL
[4:12:40] <%jillyrancher> @drtomt18 Sure. why not?
[4:12:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DrTomT18 FUCK YAH
[4:12:46] <%GuilKato> luckily your wife and husbando are on the shuttle to take care of shepard
[4:12:51] <wolfen091> @silverdevilfish nope
[4:12:55] <%BlackStarAura> LMAO
[4:12:55] <peachy996> @DrTomT18 Considering how shit the Kett in Andromeda are, I would be okay with this
[4:12:57] <Moffin23> well that isn't terrifying
[4:12:58] <jtsoppy137> yeah....
[4:13:00] <%Mekhet09> Why are the reapers a problem?
[4:13:01] <%castlerock42> Oh.
[4:13:03] <%SinnerEbru> haha belly flop
[4:13:04] <%dekkitout> Just like that?
[4:13:05] <Ekaelis> Just like that LUL
[4:13:05] <%xcompleasedad> @Mekhet09 Your answer
[4:13:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i feel like this dlc just makes the end even worse
[4:13:06] <+SmigGames> just control the reapers, war over
[4:13:06] <%Piemono> How do you mind control a robot?
[4:13:07] <Lunatyr64> straight up took out a massive reaper
[4:13:08] <akitanito> how did they even get wrecked in the first place
[4:13:10] <%jillyrancher> I'd be more pissed if they just pretend Leviathans dony exist in 4
[4:13:11] <+Redpointshine> IT JUST KILLED IT THAT EASILY??
[4:13:11] <DianaTheAscian> thats it?
[4:13:11] <mesamus> DISABLED
[4:13:14] <%castlerock42> These guys gotta go.
[4:13:14] <+ScrapKingKeita> Leviathan is a goddamn coward
[4:13:16] <AngryAsian5> They can literally shut down a reaper
[4:13:16] <%kyh9> THATS PRETTY GOOD
[4:13:16] <%InternetShis> Okay bye
[4:13:16] <%jackelzxaa> i think thats the first soverign class reaper you see die in the game
[4:13:17] <$hattrick61> yeah these guys gotta go
[4:13:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Leviathans would be  great villian
[4:13:18] <blackjack8182> How did they lose?
[4:13:18] <%xcompleasedad> @Mekhet09 Asteroid strikes
[4:13:18] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[4:13:19] <+xerotwo> C O U G H !
[4:13:20] <+Peacefrog7> ok now do that like 50 more times and we win
[4:13:20] <%professionalwitchburner> SO THE WAR IS WON, RIGHT? YOU GOT 3 LITERAL INSTQ-
[4:13:21] <haisho> they got the BIG BIOTICS
[4:13:23] <%dekkitout> Well there's the mass effect 5 plot...
[4:13:28] <metalsiren31> The question then arises WHY DID THEY EVER LOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE
[4:13:28] <%kyh9> They're like "Down Boy"
[4:13:30] <Archmortal> the Leviathans are WAY the fuck more dangerous than the Reapers lmfao
[4:13:31] <wibbwobbler> Fuck that guy
[4:13:31] <$lotharrio> @akitanito Difference between a fight and a suckerpunch.
[4:13:35] <+Redpointshine> THEY CAN JUST MINDPULSE A REAPER TO DEATH?
[4:13:35] <%professionalwitchburner> LITERAL INSTA-KILLS
[4:13:36] <%jackelzxaa> the tuchunka and rannoch reapers are baby sized by comparison
[4:13:37] <%cvp5127> what are the benz
[4:13:43] <V0LK__> they are waaay to fewer in numbers, even being as powerful as they are, chat!
[4:13:45] <%mai_waifu_> They didn't have all those balls in the past I guess
[4:13:45] <DatAsuna> We need to make leviathan hunting killbots
[4:13:49] <jtsoppy137> fuck benz
[4:13:50] <%xcompleasedad> @metalsiren31 Asteroid strikes
[4:13:54] <+cermo55> Leviathans will win 1v1 reapers, but there's a lot more reapers
[4:13:58] <Sp3ctre48> I guess???
[4:13:59] <Dunmarkh> @cvp5127 the bends
[4:14:04] <Sorrowful_Suicide> The Whorleater calebPog
[4:14:11] <Shade075> I guess they didnt have those orbs amping their telepathy back in the day, so they got harvested
[4:14:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pretty sure that was the proximity electro thing that was downing ships, not just telekilling the reaper
[4:14:15] <DatAsuna> @cermo55 also this was at least a 3 vs 1
[4:14:16] <%jackelzxaa> leviathan's war score number is very funny
[4:14:16] <teefpal> she said the thing
[4:14:16] <%DrTomT18> SHE SAID THE LINE!
[4:14:18] <%senfood> She did not just say that.
[4:14:19] <$lotharrio> Looks like Leviathan also needed a bunch of those artifacts to kill a reaper.
[4:14:21] <GandhiTheTerrible> big dumb baby <3
[4:14:21] <+liquidzr0> I still can't believe this was DLC. so much lore
[4:14:24] <%afronooch> the bends is a radiohead album
[4:14:25] <%akscully> haha
[4:14:26] <%dekkitout> @cermo55 Let's not forget the one uber thresher
[4:14:29] <%Rumbutt> "Sounds like an amazing story" nah the writing kinda sucked
[4:14:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> DOO DOO DODO DOO DOOO
[4:14:30] <mar_krow> Leviathans to terrains relation
[4:14:31] <%Mekhet09> This is what gets you the war score.
[4:14:33] <+JustToWatch> BABY
[4:14:37] <+cermo55> @cermo55 yeah, team attack
[4:14:40] <jtsoppy137> yeeeeah
[4:14:41] <%BlackStarAura> 25 war points for Ann
[4:14:41] <wolfen091> there's only 3 leviathans total left, they were worried about carrying on the species
[4:14:42] <%senfood> AND REMEMBER. WATCH THE SKIIS. I MEAN, SKIES.
[4:14:43] <+SmigGames> take those artifacts to earth
[4:14:45] <tanarath> Why does she sound monotone occasionally?
[4:14:47] <+Extrallent> if the leviathan essence was needed to make the first reaper how were they defeated when they can do shit like that?
[4:14:47] <%GuilKato> Zangief!
[4:14:47] <Archmortal> @cermo55 yeah but how did they lose before even one reaper existed
[4:14:49] <%Faustgesicht> Isn't levis war score like a 100 or something?
[4:14:49] <%brisk_dacat> Loves the smooch
[4:14:57] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaDogchamp
[4:14:58] <Ranger747> cute
[4:14:59] <Jetsfantasy> Pat Shepard drip
[4:15:01] <%WeLucklessJacks> ZANGIEF
[4:15:02] <Ekaelis> I'd like to hear what Javik thinks about this
[4:15:04] <%jackelzxaa> imagine btfo'ing soverign with this
[4:15:05] <%tank7013> Listen to that snarf
[4:15:05] <%akscully> gief is brute
[4:15:08] <wolfen091> eat him gief
[4:15:10] <%BlackStarAura> da baby
[4:15:10] <%walternatorz> why am I hearing reaper noises?
[4:15:11] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did you like this dlc?
[4:15:13] <+CapFlat> snorf
[4:15:14] <%WeLucklessJacks> psaDogchamp
[4:15:15] <cpt_langosta> gief noises sound like those cutscene-interrupting brutes
[4:15:17] <%jackelzxaa> "Hey soverign you're just a robot crab lol"
[4:15:17] <peachy996> hack it out
[4:15:17] <Sp3ctre48> That was a dlc
[4:15:18] <tanarath> @faustgesicht it was 500,I think?
[4:15:19] <%professionalwitchburner> Gief ASMR
[4:15:20] <%Monkeyweed21> If you're dating Liara she says that she wants to be the only psychic squid poking around in your head
[4:15:23] <%GuilKato> dominate power unlocked
[4:15:26] <DatAsuna> But yeah leviathans are literally a problem that leaves us no option but genocide or slavery in the long run. (Which is the only possible reason I see someone picking control)
[4:15:26] <Zombrocom> Well, that happened
[4:15:29] <%dekkitout> "Yo Javik, I met your Devils' God"
[4:15:29] <CrypticMochi> So are they going to be a me4 problem?
[4:15:33] <ThatGuyThere03> that was $10 of content I guess
[4:15:34] <%jillyrancher> lol
[4:15:36] <%professionalwitchburner> Alright now back to Earth
[4:15:36] <Samaugsch2> Hack what out?
[4:15:41] <%Alzero83> Citadel DLC is last and its the best
[4:15:45] <%tank7013> They have a team name LUL Very cute
[4:15:46] <%akscully> just got a bunch of orbs now
[4:15:47] <%Faustgesicht> 400
[4:15:52] <%Mekhet09> Yourmaxed.
[4:15:56] <$lotharrio> Leviathan Enslavement Team... fun name.
[4:16:02] <DatAsuna> I don't remember any war assets from citadel
[4:16:04] <teefpal> Im sure we can just get the nice leviathans to team up with us against the evil ones
[4:16:04] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah they're gonna form an army of brainwashed slaves I guess
[4:16:04] <%kyh9> You did max out
[4:16:09] <Samaugsch2> He keeps saying hack it out, but he never says what
[4:16:12] <%afronooch> 6800?
[4:16:12] <%ape_hawk> so, the min-max?
[4:16:13] <teefpal> 4000?
[4:16:14] <%professionalwitchburner> BUT THE BARTARIANS THO...
[4:16:18] <V0LK__> the minimun necessary?
[4:16:18] <cpt_langosta> 1 mirion twoops
[4:16:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Max to the 6800
[4:16:20] <%xcompleasedad> you can see the bar is full
[4:16:20] <DatAsuna> minimum is five thousand and something
[4:16:21] <wolfen091> well, citadel dlc gives a small amount iirc
[4:16:22] <%jillyrancher> Its desperate times.
[4:16:23] <Archmortal> it's EITHER 7600, or 7800
[4:16:26] <DatAsuna> LE lowered it
[4:16:26] <%Monkeyweed21> 6800
[4:16:27] <+cermo55> Next up, Sanctuary!!
[4:16:28] <dashmatt> yaaaaay war
[4:16:30] <%jillyrancher> 7400
[4:16:30] <$lotharrio> Full Destroy ending requires... 7800 at the end?
[4:16:31] <CrypticMochi> Hey Shepard, become an AI god to kill those things
[4:16:31] <%jackelzxaa> they changed the minimum max in legendary edition but it MIGHT be 7600 or 7800
[4:16:32] <%DrTomT18> I think if you have 8000 you get something?
[4:16:34] <%jillyrancher> iirc
[4:16:34] <V0LK__> fuck them battarians!
[4:16:36] <%jackelzxaa> oh
[4:16:37] <DatAsuna> @Archmortal That was only at launch
[4:16:41] <$lotharrio> And you get 100 right before the end.
[4:16:51] <%jackelzxaa> i like how you ACTUALLY have to prepare to get the number up in legendary.
[4:16:56] <ThatGuyThere03> FUCK EM
[4:16:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> you know who else is dead? Asari Military Command
[4:16:56] <%jillyrancher> We gonna do Horizon too?
[4:16:56] <%InternetShis> Is that it for this stream?
[4:16:57] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Open up Reaver‚Äôs child labor factory for more war funds.
[4:16:59] <teefpal> Gief agrees
[4:16:59] <$lotharrio> If we need Batarians, then why are they soeasy and satisfying to kill?
[4:17:00] <dashmatt> Just like a Variant to hate death
[4:17:00] <%jackelzxaa> do everything and get as much as you can across 3 games
[4:17:01] <trippy325> This is the first time I have heard of this "new" ending. I wonder if they did this to make the next ME game make more sense. I mean ALL old school ME fans know the disaster of the original ending. Most of the writers walked out after Casey told them what to do. lol
[4:17:03] <Archmortal> @Archmortal Oh, I didn't realize they adjusted it, good.  It was way too high for general audience
[4:17:05] <DatAsuna> Oh yeah there's 1 war asset after the point of no return but who eevn cares at that point?
[4:17:06] <Zombrocom> Bork
[4:17:17] <%Mekhet09> Where kai lang to tell you that he killed the leviathan off scene?
[4:17:31] <DatAsuna> @trippy325 What do you mean all old school fans? This came out that year. lol
[4:17:32] <GandhiTheTerrible> did pat do Citadel?
[4:17:32] <bear_breaker20> thatsa  scary point for edi to make
[4:17:36] <Samaugsch2> You can actually get unlimited war assets thanks to multiplayer lol
[4:17:37] <ThatGuyThere03> has he killed Kai Leng yet?

[4:18:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt if you were dating Liara, she says she wants to be the only psychic squid poking around in your head
[4:18:47] <%GuilKato> remember when Zangief wanted to be friends with the elcor because of the deep voice coming out the speakers
[4:18:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> She doens't get it anymore

[4:19:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> how could you
[4:19:02] <%professionalwitchburner> @patstaresat Ever realize that the Asari head tentacles look like the tops of Reapers?
[4:19:04] <peachy996> it's unimpressive but I see it
[4:19:07] <scrumbotime> carth's door is where you slam his penis
[4:19:11] <$lotharrio> Pat, they're flirting!

[4:19:53] <AngryAsian5> Get a threesome going Shepard LUL
[4:19:53] <trippy325> @datasuna Ah so the ending will still be crap... Sorry I blocked out memories of vanilla ME3. Only game in the trilogy I played once then turned off forever. I like the alternate ending mod that was made by a fan
[4:19:55] <teefpal> Theyre just friends
[4:19:55] <fetelgeuse> Threesome.
[4:19:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> I can't believe my boyfriend is flirting with my wife

[4:19:58] <zhenthrim213> menagi a trois

[4:20:04] <%kyh9> TALI, ARE YOU CHEATING ON ME
[4:20:04] <peachy996> Garrus can't have that unless you can have a piece of him
[4:20:05] <%jackelzxaa> tali is the cute waifu of the game.  like noelle.
[4:20:05] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[4:20:06] <%toolofparanoia> Space Threesome?
[4:20:06] <stormhawk9891> @PaperyHornet1013 Wouldn't blame her honestly
[4:20:10] <+squeejiro> Spacy polycule
[4:20:11] <peachy996> Me too Javik
[4:20:11] <%DrTomT18> wait talk again
[4:20:11] <%cvp5127> space trouple
[4:20:12] <Sp3ctre48> JAVIK BASED
[4:20:13] <%Mutsu2k> psaHoldon
[4:20:15] <%InternetShis> CUCK HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
[4:20:16] <%Monkeyweed21> fuckin wow Javik
[4:20:16] <%kyh9> You might have triggered the Liara romance
[4:20:16] <mr_saturday93> he has more to say
[4:20:17] <$hattrick61> gotta lockdown that throuple shep
[4:20:20] <knight_verse> Garrus trying to move in on your girl.
[4:20:21] <%jtdobyns> @toolofparanoia shh spoilers
[4:20:21] <%jackelzxaa> cortez MIGHT have something to say
[4:20:23] <Zombrocom> Javik has nothing to say about the CREATORS OF THE REAPERS
[4:20:24] <DatAsuna> @trippy325 You say that, but your first message was having memories of nothing but vanilla. lol
[4:20:24] <AngryAsian5> BASED
[4:20:27] <%jillyrancher> He got nothing to say about Leviathans
[4:20:28] <%cylish> So like you guys are space poly? hot
[4:20:31] <%GuilKato> you'd think Javek would have shit to say about the leviathan and bio-indoctrination
[4:20:33] <%jillyrancher> hmmmmm
[4:20:37] <wolfen091> its mr steal your gurl
[4:20:42] <Sp3ctre48> @kyh9 You can't trigger a romance when you're already locked into one
[4:20:44] <%jillyrancher> Awww Mommy Steve
[4:20:45] <%tank7013> I legitimately feel that Garrus and Tali would be down for a space threesome with Shepard
[4:20:51] <%GuilKato> check the shop
[4:20:52] <%jillyrancher> he worries about you
[4:20:52] <%jackelzxaa> i wonder if they considered making cortez be jacob and traynor be miranda
[4:20:54] <lloyddboy> where the head
[4:21:00] <%jillyrancher> @tank7013 Citadel....
[4:21:01] <AluxStreams> Worst emotional throughline.
[4:21:07] <%afronooch> Oh no! The man i saw for literally 20 seconds
[4:21:08] <%GuilKato> shop?
[4:21:09] <PaperyHornet1013> talk to tali pat
[4:21:17] <%AmuserName> "Man, you people in this cycle sure got those 'I hate my wife and her talking' jokes right on!"
[4:21:22] <%Monkeyweed21> it reminds me of Mide from Heavensward
[4:21:24] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt you can fry ann bryson's brain on the renegade path and james gets sad about it
[4:21:26] <tanarath> yeah, they should have said less about ann.
[4:21:28] <teefpal> I dunno what they could have done to fix that tbh
[4:21:30] <Jetsfantasy> We can hear him be big snorty boi
[4:21:31] <%jillyrancher> Like Bryson literally dies in like a minute
[4:21:35] <%jackelzxaa> go see the head
[4:21:38] <mar_krow> Javik and liara never meet your heros
[4:21:39] <DatAsuna> Now lets go kill kai leng
[4:21:40] <%jillyrancher> maybe if we got to know him but
[4:21:41] <$lotharrio> Every other pure Soldier can die, so they needed "someone" to put in this one... shoulda been a Batarian, though.
[4:21:43] <trippy325> I'm just glad I didn't buy this version and still have my modded ones. Same visuals with better story lol!
[4:21:44] <%jillyrancher> we dont lol
[4:21:50] <%Rumbutt> This literally just sounds like the writers patting themselves on the back
[4:21:54] <%GuilKato> zangief is being too powerful for paige?
[4:22:00] <macathelo> hes beating up page?
[4:22:01] <%jackelzxaa> putting a batarian squadmate in me3 woulda been the thing to do
[4:22:02] <PaperyHornet1013> "die mother"
[4:22:07] <DatAsuna> @trippy325 Except none of that is new content for LE
[4:22:08] <macathelo> holy...
[4:22:10] <cpt_langosta> One of these days, Pat's gonna say "Oh shit," leave the couch, and never return.
[4:22:12] <%Rumbutt> "must've been an amazing story" "makes the whole world a lot bigger"
[4:22:14] <Jetsfantasy> "Long live... the Gief"
[4:22:17] <%jackelzxaa> i would have loved if me3 had a batarian and jack as squadmates to round out the cast a little more
[4:22:23] <%jackelzxaa> since theres two empty rooms the whole game
[4:22:24] <teefpal> @trippy325 Im waiting for EGM to be ported to the Legendary Edition
[4:22:25] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:22:26] <%jackelzxaa> thane's room and jack's basement
[4:22:33] <%jackelzxaa> it's almost like those could have been 2 more characters
[4:22:34] <Jetsfantasy> m6kwFishpls
[4:22:38] <wolfen091> just put him on camera pat
[4:22:42] <+Redpointshine> I cant velieve Kai Leng fucked your space wife
[4:22:46] <%jillyrancher> Batarian in multiplayer are cool
[4:22:59] <%polothegreatest> paige needs to go training school with zangief. hes too powerful to handle now psaDogchamp
[4:23:06] <tanarath> Batarian in 2 would have fit perfectly
[4:23:18] <teefpal> Hope a batarian squaddie is in me4
[4:23:19] <%jackelzxaa> kai leng snuck on board the normandy and ate shepard's cereal
[4:23:28] <Goatllama> Zangief was more powerful than Paige fresh out the womb
[4:23:30] <%dekkitout> Bray would've been a great add to the crew
[4:23:37] <+liquidzr0> shofuDance shofuDance shofuDance
[4:23:42] <%jackelzxaa> @teefpal you mean "i hope the filthy batarians finally go extinct in me4"
[4:23:43] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng took an upper decker in your toliet
[4:23:50] <@Ranryu692> yeah, Bray should've been a crew member
[4:23:53] <%jillyrancher> Bray is cool
[4:24:02] <%jackelzxaa> it's weird how the fucking vorcha never make it above "killable goons with no souls or human rights"
[4:24:05] <+Redpointshine> I can't believe Kai Leng snuck into Shepards room while he was sleeping and lovingly kissed him on the lips
[4:24:06] <@Ranryu692> they really needed a few extra years to finish this game
[4:24:07] <%jillyrancher> Bray should be a porn star so I can appreciate him more
[4:24:11] <%jackelzxaa> vorcha never get acknowledged as people
[4:24:13] <Sp3ctre48> I like Zaeed but I would cut him out any day for a Batarian squadmate in ME2
[4:24:20] <%jackelzxaa> it's like you can just legally kill vorcha if you're bored
[4:24:22] <jtsoppy137> the party dlc feels like someone wrote it as a joke
[4:24:32] <DatAsuna> @jillyrancher SFM already provided that
[4:24:44] <%jackelzxaa> the party dlc feels like someone wrote it after a year of bad fan backlash
[4:24:50] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[4:24:50] <+Redpointshine> I can't believe Kai Leng made Shepard renew their vows
[4:24:54] <%jackelzxaa> and went "they're right lets just go out with a fun christmas special"
[4:25:01] <trippy325> @datasuna You are obviously fan and we will agree to disagree. Censored bits are not a better version. Plus less story elements available. (ie same sex romance options, better ending, etc). What they did was copy ALOT mod which we can get for free. But you do you I'm done arguing personal taste
[4:25:14] <%jackelzxaa> i can't believe kai leng deleted all of shepard's vods on his twitch channel
[4:25:27] <%jillyrancher> wut
[4:25:32] <DatAsuna> @trippy325 I literally said nothing other than "this content existed before the remaster" lol
[4:25:36] <%DrTomT18> Kai Leng told the Collectors where to find Shepard
[4:25:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> lol
[4:25:53] <jtsoppy137> i can't believe kai leng stole sheperds lunch money
[4:25:57] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng left a tack in your chair
[4:26:01] <DatAsuna> Feel free to dislike it, I never said it was good. I said it was old.
[4:26:06] <+Redpointshine> I can't believe Kai Leng peed in Shepards Toilet and didnt flush
[4:26:12] <+cermo55> Kai Leng found the Leviathans first
[4:26:15] <%jackelzxaa> The trilogy remaster is visually better than ALOT
[4:26:22] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng deleted your Persona 4 Gold save file
[4:26:27] <%jackelzxaa> i say this as someone that ran an alot trilogy playthrough as a leadin to legendary
[4:26:30] <%GuilKato> Kai Leng filled Zangiefs water bowl over and over which is why he needs to pee so badly just to to delay the stream
[4:26:38] <%jackelzxaa> and the official stuff is JUST higher quality than the mods were
[4:26:50] <%Thorlias> Thorlias subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 year les gooo
[4:26:54] <DatAsuna> @trippy325 We can disagree on opinions. When something was released is a statement of fact. There's no opinions to be had about release dates
[4:26:57] <jtsoppy137> Kai Leng is a better dancer Kappa
[4:27:01] <+Redpointshine> Kai Leng  ate the last piece of pie even though Shepard had his name on the container
[4:27:02] <%jackelzxaa> the overhauls to me1 are also just better than what we were able to do with mods (especially the new mako controls and gun attributes)
[4:27:12] <ghosrevan> kai leng will kill chaos
[4:27:14] <%Thorlias> psaDab
[4:27:19] <%jillyrancher> That bastard hes so nuts
[4:27:21] <%jackelzxaa> kai leng is actually what happens when kris removes his heart
[4:27:26] <%jackelzxaa> kai leng slashed toriel's tires
[4:27:26] <@Ranryu692> Kai Leng snuck into your cabin and moved everything on your desk exactly 7cm to the left
[4:27:30] <%jillyrancher> Now its fun.
[4:27:37] <%Profmcstevie> NOT MY DESK
[4:27:46] <PaperyHornet1013> so is pat coming around on best boy kai leng?
[4:27:48] <%terrible35> Kai Leng threw pudding on the ceiling
[4:27:48] <lloyddboy> DOG STREAM

[4:27:59] <%jackelzxaa> he is bullying pat
[4:28:02] <jtsoppy137> Kai Leng would have killed the Reapers in Mass Effect 1

[4:28:19] <%jackelzxaa> dog farts
[4:28:21] <%BlackStarAura> Chaos
[4:28:22] <+Redpointshine> Kai Leng snuck onto your computer and  uninstalled your Steam Games
[4:28:23] <akitanito> gief trying to get pat banned with ass streaming
[4:28:26] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng would've fucked Emily Wong
[4:28:29] <%jackelzxaa> pat we could hear zangief farting into the mic
[4:28:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats a dog ass
[4:28:36] <%DrTomT18> Kai Leng switched all of the Dextro food out with Krogan Food
[4:28:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Whats the distance between the couch and the wall?
[4:28:38] <%GuilKato> two low centre of gravity fighters!
[4:28:45] <trippy325> @jackelzxaa visually haven't seen much difference. Running 4k textures already
[4:28:49] <%InternetShis> Kai Gief ate your cat food
[4:28:53] <stormhawk9891> We totally can
[4:28:53] <%notsoy> if he had farted, we probably could have, but he didn't
[4:28:55] <akitanito> *sniff*
[4:28:58] <ghosrevan> this is giefs world and we are just living in it
[4:28:58] <jtsoppy137> Kai Leng would have made Anthom work
[4:29:01] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt Kai Leng snuck into the normandy and ate shepard's cereal and deleted all of the vods on shepard's twitch channel
[4:29:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> would you?
[4:29:09] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Would we
[4:29:12] <%Profmcstevie> Gief stinks penetrate through the mic
[4:29:14] <%GuilKato> pat gief more
[4:29:15] <trippy325> Not rewarding them with $60 for a rerelease with bad ending
[4:29:15] <%walternatorz> did you set it on the cat food?
[4:29:17] <Midnight188> if gief farted into the mic it'd be clipped instantly
[4:29:26] <%jillyrancher> God hes so cool guys holy shit
[4:29:35] <%polothegreatest> WutFace
[4:29:44] <%jackelzxaa> @trippy325 the source textures just look better than the ai upscale and alot of it is hard to point out without side by sides if you don't have experience making texture maps
[4:29:46] <PaperyHornet1013> GAMER fourplay
[4:29:50] <ghosrevan> he did
[4:29:50] <+Redpointshine> I can't believe Kai leng rode shotgun after Shepard called dibs
[4:29:51] <%jillyrancher> ANY THINGUH
[4:29:55] <%jackelzxaa> thane's legendary textures are just a million times better
[4:29:55] <PaperyHornet1013> TALI

[4:31:06] <%jackelzxaa> @trippy325 the mako changes and gun changes alone do more for me1 than anyone can do with mods
[4:31:07] <peachy996> was it worth it
[4:31:07] <%terrible35> het bud
[4:31:07] <%dekkitout> Great talk, buddy
[4:31:09] <Sp3ctre48> Shepard is a strange man
[4:31:15] <%afronooch> if they somehow coax Tali's VA into return for ME4 its 10/10 for me regardless
[4:31:15] <+Redpointshine> Remember that time Kai Leng made fart noises when Shepard walked by, I can't believe he did that
[4:31:17] <%DrTomT18> did you like it?
[4:31:18] <%walternatorz> You realize that will be in the room every time you invite Tali up, right?
[4:31:20] <akitanito> good jerb
[4:31:20] <+D00msDayDan> Perfect
[4:31:21] <peachy996> That's going to kill the mood for every bedroom encounter now
[4:31:22] <%Faustgesicht> That should be your alarm
[4:31:23] <%GuilKato> so whats next?
[4:31:23] <%jillyrancher> No its great
[4:31:25] <DatAsuna> I'd guess 2-3 streams left then
[4:31:34] <Zombrocom> It's gonna watch now
[4:31:34] <Sp3ctre48> It was very ok!
[4:31:36] <%polothegreatest> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[4:31:36] <trippy325> $60 for mako controls lol
[4:31:39] <%jackelzxaa> me1 LE is just a better game than a fully modded me1 and i spent days and days making sure i had them right
[4:31:40] <%dekkitout> I'd like to think James glued the head to your desk so it could watch you sleep
[4:31:41] <+D00msDayDan> Tali, meet screaming head
[4:31:41] <Shade075> Cant wait till Shep brings out the head for the last romance stream
[4:31:43] <jtsoppy137> 2
[4:31:44] <$realm_forge> Feed the head to your fish
[4:31:44] <%jackelzxaa> pat theres at least 2 or 3 streams left
[4:31:45] <%DrTomT18> you gotta do Horizon before Citidel
[4:31:46] <+cermo55> Sanctuary is the last mission you can do before DLC
[4:31:46] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:31:47] <jtsoppy137> yeah
[4:31:47] <%afronooch> Do you want Miranda in the Citadel stuff?
[4:31:48] <teefpal> Probably 2
[4:31:48] <@Ranryu692> citadel is LONG
[4:31:48] <%PunchSlugfest> 2 to 3 for sure
[4:31:48] <DatAsuna> Definitely not 1 stream
[4:31:48] <+SmigGames> probably 2
[4:31:49] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng stole Shepards pencil hes so crazy
[4:31:50] <peachy996> Def 2-3
[4:31:50] <blackjack8182> Did you like it
[4:31:50] <%Mattais88> You need to do Horizon before the citadel
[4:31:51] <+jojo_abob> 2 long ones?
[4:31:51] <GustauveVIII> citadel is long as fuck
[4:31:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> Citadel is beefy iirc
[4:31:52] <%demiiluna> @peachy996 you mean enhance?
[4:31:53] <%jackelzxaa> theres multiple missions af6ter thessia
[4:31:53] <+hatok> citadel is HUGE
[4:31:54] <metalsiren31> Citadel is longer
[4:31:55] <%Lefanque> at least 2 yeah
[4:31:55] <Sp3ctre48> Probably like 3 dude
[4:31:55] <%alternative_flu> Citadel pretty long I think
[4:31:56] <PaperyHornet1013> 10 HOUR STREAM
[4:31:58] <Virokwet> 2 sounds right...
[4:31:58] <%Profmcstevie> Citadel is not small
[4:31:59] <%InternetShis> Horizon before Citadel
[4:31:59] <mesamus> citadel is LONG
[4:31:59] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah horizon
[4:32:00] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Do Horizon first
[4:32:00] <peachy996> There's a lot of stuff to do in Citadel
[4:32:00] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Should do Sanctuary before Citadel.
[4:32:00] <teefpal> Three, nah hes playing on casual
[4:32:01] <%jtdobyns> citadel like 6 hours
[4:32:02] <%Faustgesicht> Citadel is realy long actually
[4:32:04] <SalvoFatts> Citadel kind of big if you want to do everything
[4:32:04] <%InternetShis> Citadel is fuckin FAT
[4:32:06] <%afronooch> Horizon if you want Miranda there
[4:32:08] <blackjack8182> 2 maybe 3
[4:32:11] <%jackelzxaa> citadel dlc is multiple missions and then ALOT of story content in the new hub
[4:32:12] <DatAsuna> Horizen then Ceberus base then earth and earth is multiple parts
[4:32:16] <%machshop> citadel is fuuuun
[4:32:16] <%jackelzxaa> citadel is more than just the party
[4:32:18] <falyden> Citadel is pretty darn long
[4:32:20] <%Lefanque> Citidel is pretty long
[4:32:21] <%WeLucklessJacks> Did you already do Omega?
[4:32:23] <%jillyrancher> You'll miss some stuff if you dont do Horizon
[4:32:25] <%DrTomT18> Citadel is like 2 DLCs in  one
[4:32:29] <+Redpointshine> I can't believe Kai Leng copied Shepard's homework  but didn't make it look  different so the teacher found out hes so insane
[4:32:29] <%rkbinder> Sanctuary
[4:32:30] <%demiiluna> Citadel is at least 2 streams
[4:32:31] <PaperyHornet1013> 2 streams for citidel
[4:32:34] <%jackelzxaa> giant bomb did citadel in two streams
[4:32:35] <+cermo55> Just Citadel is 2 streams minimum
[4:32:36] <teefpal> Citadel is a whole thing
[4:32:37] <%jillyrancher> Horizon is really short though
[4:32:39] <%DrTomT18> yes
[4:32:39] <%InternetShis> Peepus
[4:32:40] <cpt_langosta> get ready for citadel to be the only good mission left in the entire game
[4:32:42] <DatAsuna> Citadel could be 1 stream but a big stream
[4:32:42] <fetelgeuse> Relatable.
[4:32:43] <ghosrevan> like 6 hours
[4:32:45] <tanarath> @welucklessjacks he did, it was disappointing
[4:32:48] <%afronooch> LUL
[4:32:49] <%GuilKato> zangief is efficiently cooling
[4:32:54] <%jackelzxaa> the second citadel stream is likely to be zero combat
[4:32:54] <Dabrikishaw> Horizon > Cerberus Base > Earth is long enough to need its own stream. After that Citadel needs its own stream.
[4:32:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> full of dog juice
[4:32:56] <%machshop> he crashed
[4:32:58] <jtsoppy137> zzzz
[4:32:59] <%jillyrancher> One big stream LESS GOOOOO
[4:33:00] <%akscully> fat boy loves cooler weather
[4:33:02] <%GuilKato> so now that gief is a asleep more mass effect time!
[4:33:05] <PaperyHornet1013> 2 streams just for citadel pat
[4:33:05] <%polothegreatest> its the spite psaDogchamp
[4:33:06] <teefpal> Hes in his dream world
[4:33:07] <+SmigGames> there's a lot of optional stuff in citader
[4:33:07] <%SinnerEbru> could u move the cam and let us see??
[4:33:14] <trippy325> @cpt_langosta Truth
[4:33:16] <Midnight188> dog.exe is not responding
[4:33:19] <$realm_forge> Get him a treadmill
[4:33:20] <%Alzero83> You do Citadel before end game
[4:33:24] <%Alzero83> no after
[4:33:35] <teefpal> golfclap
[4:33:37] <%ElkRiverDog> Welcome to fatherhood, Pat
[4:33:47] <+Redpointshine> I ran out of Kai Leng jokes
[4:33:50] <DatAsuna> Fuck your fc
[4:33:51] <%jackelzxaa> also theres one part of the citadel dlc that you should really take edi on and the chat can probably let you know when (there's a unique scene she gets and i hope no one ruins it)
[4:33:56] <%jillyrancher> I'm gonna play Killzone Shadow Fall multiplayer with bots cause why the fuck not
[4:33:59] <DatAsuna> Buncha grouches
[4:34:03] <ghosrevan> pat u good?
[4:34:05] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i just did 1 80 per class type
[4:34:28] <Tracazoid> Took me until like 5 months ago until I finally got all my classes to 80. I have been playing since Heavensward.
[4:34:34] <%afronooch> I got one of each role to 80 and cant find the will to level any of the others past like 45
[4:34:35] <%jinking79> it's true
[4:34:42] <+RoByte2> Fly around on the Amaro to assert dominance

[4:35:35] <+KingpinLarry> Looks like you're about to end soon. Did ya beat the game yet.
[4:35:37] <+dd44dostivei> remember when troy mcclure was answering shitty simpsons fan mail from professors and ambassadors
[4:35:43] <%faldin> entry position, 10 years experience required
[4:35:45] <%Daxalog> They were never open in the first place
[4:35:49] <%Profmcstevie> They just have gaps in their teams and don't wanna train SHIT
[4:35:51] <%Mattais88> They expect you to work for free for a few years before you get the real job
[4:35:52] <cpt_langosta> toilet sex?
[4:35:58] <%Dabrikishaw> Dabrikishaw subscribed at Tier 1.

[4:36:03] <@Ranryu692> @cpt_langosta toilet sets
[4:36:13] <%Monkeyweed21> they got Saber from Fate:Grand Order
[4:36:13] <%CatastropheCorvid> Employers do that when they're required to post outside listings but want to fill the position internally.
[4:36:19] <%Dabrikishaw> Horizon > Cerberus Base > Earth is long enough to need its own stream. After that Citadel needs its own stream.
[4:36:22] <teefpal> @Mattais88 graduated from university, living this reality rn
[4:36:29] <%cvp5127> what shirt is that pat?
[4:36:37] <trippy325> Also wanted to mention one of mt most major beefs with remaster: WHAT DID THEY DO TO KELLY CHAMBERS" FACE? rip
[4:36:44] <DatAsuna> do not kiss your therapist
[4:36:45] <leinadtonu> Man, do I have a lot of points.
[4:36:50] <trippy325> ruined her
[4:36:51] <%baka_sugoi> Thats a lot of BABYS BabyRage
[4:36:51] <@Ranryu692> @Dabrikishaw Citadel goes after Horizon
[4:36:54] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Nope its to allow them to claim they dont have local people that qualify so they can get cheaper Visa people to work it more a problem in tech
[4:37:06] <cpt_langosta> nice
[4:37:06] <%Mattais88> @teefpal Same here.
[4:37:10] <%baka_sugoi> word hard
[4:37:23] <DatAsuna> @Dabrikishaw Yeah if you like ending on a wet fart
[4:37:33] <teefpal> all the time
[4:37:33] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ok Kermet
[4:37:34] <General_Terro> no LUL
[4:37:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PhantomMiG I work for a company that does this, as well as the internal hiring thing.

[4:37:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> occasionally
[4:37:39] <%SinnerEbru> yeah words hard
[4:37:44] <%brisk_dacat> You speak kinda good
[4:37:54] <%walternatorz> 'lest?
[4:37:56] <%tank7013> For me it doesn't even get that far I just sit there thinking the word but completely unable to say it
[4:37:59] <%dekkitout> I sometimes have a Louisianan drawl
[4:38:00] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> 50% of Scottish people can't say purple burglar alarm
[4:38:00] <%Monkeyweed21> is pat blaming accidental racism on a speech impedement
[4:38:01] <%barrakuta371> why use many word when small word do
[4:38:04] <@Ranryu692> @Dabrikishaw If you like ending at the ending
[4:38:07] <cpt_langosta> but doesn't bustin make you feel good?
[4:38:10] <%jackelzxaa> giant bomb managed to do everything from "the mandatory romance scene" until credits in a single stream
[4:38:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> wait, sometimes your word hole just makes you say italian?
[4:38:13] <%faldin> hell yeah
[4:38:15] <teefpal> Thats great!
[4:38:17] <Jetsfantasy> Congrats! üëè
[4:38:18] <%jackelzxaa> pat's on narrative mode so the combat missions WILL go faster
[4:38:21] <%Dabrikishaw> @Dabrikishaw My idea was that Pat should get the bad ending out of the way first, then wash the bad taste out with Citadel.
[4:38:25] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK YEA BEING CANCER FREE RULES
[4:38:43] <peachy996> You can't stop Janeway from kill lol
[4:38:44] <DatAsuna> @Dabrikishaw Agreed, that's the way everyone else experienced citadel anyway
[4:38:45] <%cvp5127> he could with his peen
[4:38:53] <KnivesEve> Kai Leng could stop Janeway
[4:38:57] <peachy996> Not even his peen
[4:38:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LA HE
[4:39:02] <%DrTomT18> Shepard stopped like 2 wars and awoke a 14 billion year old alien from it's eternal slumber by yelling
[4:39:09] <@QueequegTheater> Do you know
[4:39:09] <tanarath> la hee
[4:39:13] <@QueequegTheater> La Hee?
[4:39:16] <DatAsuna> @KnivesEve He'd probably get beaten up by Tuvok
[4:39:17] <peachy996> If you refuse to bang Q how could Shepard ever compare
[4:39:21] <PaperyHornet1013> how many times did pat die today?
[4:39:21] <%dekkitout> Crysis 3 also had a big space evil squid
[4:39:25] <%Axellogic> I still remember the stream where they thought people yelling La Hee was some spam bot attack
[4:39:32] <teefpal> @Dabrikishaw Unless you use mods like Citadel Epilogue
[4:39:38] <%mai_waifu_> They really ARE enough
[4:39:40] <cpt_langosta> only replacement for big company, never indie
[4:39:47] <%DrTomT18> I enjoy watching you experience things
[4:39:48] <Archmortal> the studios EA buys and tries to kill like space cthulus, EA itself kind of hates them
[4:39:51] <$realm_forge> EA is trying to hold back the cosmic horror by cannibalizing game studios
[4:39:51] <@ssjklyco> ssjklyco subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 43 month streak! 
[4:40:02] <%Mattais88> BTW: New Melty is fucking sick

[4:40:29] <teefpal> wow I love both octopi and pimps
[4:40:31] <%Profmcstevie> We'll hate it together
[4:40:32] <cpt_langosta> bye bye, small man
[4:40:32] <%baka_sugoi> bye
[4:40:33] <trippy325> Let's not forget that the Bioware dudes became EA higher ups after acquisition guys. They are also responsible for the ruining of Bioware
