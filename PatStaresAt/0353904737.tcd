[0:22:14] <the_sprankton> in The Life and Times of Scrooge, it's mentioned that Scrooge can dive into gold because he has supernatural affinity to it. That's not even a joke.

[0:22:20] <OwlLightningMage> He killed himself LUL
[0:22:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> in the show he literally says it was a skill he had to learn how to do, and only he can do it
[0:22:20] <+tknot21> Family guy did it.
[0:22:21] <ElenaManetta> @AngriestPat It's said in the comics and cartoon that it's a special skill where he is able to flex his muscles in such a way that he loosens himself and dives in like liquid
[0:22:21] <%fingalights> It's still solid
[0:22:22] <UW_Duncan> It’s actually one of the softer metals
[0:22:22] <+cuttlecrow> it's a metal ffs
[0:22:22] <RestingLichFayce> Pat, wish we could sub or donate, but i recently lost my job. my wife and I wanna say that we love you and support you. We know you're gonna be fine cause you're a boss
[0:22:22] <cavegift> you could eat gold. its fine. tastes good
[0:22:23] <Ugato> Gold is soft FOR A METAL
[0:22:24] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Malleability ain't softness
[0:22:24] <+The48thCrow> Mario die from eat mushroom
[0:22:24] <Bakefowl> It’s cartoon gold
[0:22:24] <KhonsuII> His greed makes him dense and strong
[0:22:24] <undyne486> still not wrong
[0:22:24] <Delrus95> no
[0:22:25] <CrimsonFox777> He's an experienced millionaire/billionaire. He knows what he's doing.
[0:22:25] <+UnCleDICKbutT> SO IT'S FAKE GOLD
[0:22:25] <%TombstoneTTromboners> iron man could dive into it
[0:22:25] <+pixelkenj> I remember the Thundercats ripping on gold and calling it useless
[0:22:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> meeew
[0:22:26] <+SuichiTanaka> Scrooge's special ability is to do that.
[0:22:26] <%Solidnick18> ELMO
[0:22:26] <matrignomy7> He has a special technique. No for real.
[0:22:28] <Kemmybelle> maybe it's chocolate coins just for diving into.
[0:22:28] <+Jonesman64> its HEAVY AS FUCK
[0:22:28] <TheSpiritof2277> it's only soft relative to other metals
[0:22:29] <ithonmage> How do you know pat are you a leprechaun?
[0:22:29] <Laicuss> Pat is Family Guy

[0:22:33] <underratedjustin> Elmo is crying
[0:22:33] <$RubberFistFight> Gold coins aren't 24K, they're usually mixed with a bit of silver and copper to harden them.
[0:22:33] <%marsanta> In canon he can do it because he knows the 'trick' to it
[0:22:33] <efratzy> but it wasnt solid gold it was a bunch of gold coins so he could sink in
[0:22:34] <+mashinchaserr> even water can hurt if you're high enough
[0:22:34] <Tene8rous> and ducks have hollow bones. shit would become dust
[0:22:34] <YakumoYomi> Break those porous duck bones!
[0:22:36] <alrobot2014> its a softer metal, but its still fucking metal
[0:22:36] <%bigdumbidiotguy> as far as metal, being able to bend a gold coin is pretty soft
[0:22:37] <ProtoShawk> Big Scream
[0:22:38] <lemon_lore> when is smash??

If you go to their discord they basically just kinda un-subtly suggest you're doing something wrong. Also, their bot documentation is horribly out of date and very scant on much-needed detail.

[1:31:41] <CastellanVon> @FrostMass22 There is no style switching in Kiwami 2, you have one fighting style but it's soooo good.

[1:31:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> Why is Pat getting up early?
[1:31:55] <xeros720> how long has the game been going?
[1:31:55] <BeefyQueefer> Paige the kind of girl who needs to be let outside *sigh* such a hassle
[1:31:56] <+Badgerconda_> Pat's been 'going to bed early' which is code for being too depressed to get out of bed. Poor Pat.
[1:31:56] <thetruenicster> In KIwami 2, the moveset is one generalized one that mixes all of the fighting styles into one

[1:32:28] <ZippyPsycho> Yakuza 3 is getting a remaster
[1:32:28] <flame_of_udun_> @frostmass22 it is, it’s basically the same but more streamlined

[1:32:31] <%Freelance7> It's just gonna be a remaster
[1:32:31] <CyricZ42> It's just a remaster, and it's already out in Japan
[1:32:32] <teflonbilly777> Isn't 3 just getting uprezzed and the framerate fizxed?
[1:32:32] <+thewaryknight> Shinji gets off on watching
[1:32:33] <CastellanVon> Dragon Style in Kiwami 1 is worthless except for Tiger Drop.
[1:32:34] <Josef_Stryker> @AngriestPat 3 isn't getting a remake, 3-5 it just getting a Remaster
[1:32:36] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> 3 and 4 are just remasters...

[1:34:54] <CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan angry Babushka
[1:34:59] <ThePuddingDead> You clearly never been cross-checked by a granny during the christmas season Paige
[1:34:59] <@thenefftw> The only people that don't fight Kiryu are usually women
[1:34:59] <narusao> so like brooklyn but with japanese
[1:35:00] <%Dragonfang1337> I think we fought a grandma in this series LUL
[1:35:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
[1:35:02] <%FrostMass22> There's literally a grandma in 0 that threatens you
[1:35:02] <%yeknomlive> is there an auto button?
[1:35:02] <Bouldus> no do the shitty recaps
[1:35:03] <WaxWitch> We only Co-Own Pat, the other owner is Paige LUL
[1:35:03] <hextonegaming> I mean, honestly. There's SOOO MUCH Dialogue. Reading it all aloud would probably make the game a good +50 hours? I'm just spitballing, but like I can understand reading the main story shit.
[1:35:04] <CrowbarFacelift> That one grandma in Kiwami 2 is for real
[1:35:04] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> OBATARIAN IS GOD TIER!
[1:35:06] <admiral_of_crunch> Only some grandmas
[1:35:07] <%Toynota10> He'll read if its funny

[1:35:08] <%Solidnick18> HEAT
[1:35:09] <thelonechris> Basically New York
[1:35:10] <Tombahat> Also delinquent gangs send their newbies after Kiryu as a form of hazing because they know he'll fuck their shit up.
[1:35:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat Just Abridge it for us
[1:35:11] <gyrogogozeppeli> DEAD

[1:35:14] <%Prism_Wing> None of it is important.
[1:35:14] <+filthyheretichorus> Yo fuck he dialogue
[1:35:15] <thetruenicster> Let's remember that one of the reasons Kiryu has to fight random people on the street constantly is because it is a hazing ritual
[1:35:15] <WanderingSwordsman> Well time for him to die...
[1:35:15] <faytthepally> HEATOGA

[1:38:12] <colzack_> @AngriestPat what are your thoughts on Judge Eyes getting a dub with a bunch of big actors
[1:38:12] <thatwaulfyguy> localization of yakuza where everyone is still in japanese EXCEPT we get hamill in for majima
[1:38:13] <gyrogogozeppeli> STEP THE FUCK UP, ITS TIME TO DIE
[1:38:13] <+angel949> also they changed his name to kazama

[1:38:15] <+subdude_> The localization wasn't very good at first either.
[1:38:15] <@SSaryn> Hamill himself was great while everyone else really wasn't.
[1:38:16] <%Dragonfang1337> they added a whole lot of fucking swearing in the dub script
[1:38:16] <dukenux> Yeah, for once a thing from Japan that really cares about lip sync
[1:38:17] <Kataguro> Majima, stop poking the bear
[1:38:17] <%deviljhojho94> how can he slap
[1:38:18] <rosencruez> pimp slapped

[1:45:36] <dukenux> Remember: Sonic is Yakuza's money laundering scheme
[1:45:40] <Rincewind1998> Kiryu is fine with crime against other criminals or people who are involved in the underworld, but he hates involving innocent people. It's hearkening back to an old code of honor the Yakuza may or may not have operated by at one point.
[1:45:40] <+bigbradish> Kiryu you baka
[1:45:44] <@JustinianKnight> Izakaya?

[3:22:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat He literally took a murder rap for you.
[3:22:45] <%theblackgoddess> @Dakuu75 that's valid, I'm also curious to know but I won't press for details. Maybe it was just time for them to end it before they started to resent each other
[3:22:47] <%SulfurousAcid> @SvenHolgersson Majima for smash
[3:22:48] <Momijibot> To be fair, Nishiki had a good reason to kill - however, he didn't push back against Kiryu taking the fall hard enough.

[3:59:16] <thetruenicster> Shimano was the OG MR Shakedown
[3:59:18] <%neo_cosmos> Paige could probably kill herself on accident with a piece of paper and a paper clip.

[4:00:33] <%bluetocho13> @angriestpat when a enemy is bent over like that switch to the style that correspond's to that color, you also need full bar to get a kiwami move

[4:01:11] <the_red_comet_uc> use Woolie as Hannibal
[4:01:12] <Cardboard96> The idea of rush is to NOT get hit pat
[4:01:12] <ape_hawk> have anyone ever seen eric andre and fortnite in the same room?

[4:02:34] <Spiderfacev> shimano just stomped you in the dick

[4:02:35] <dekkitout> in. the. dick.
[4:02:36] <%FadingEmber> @AngriestPat You know the charity thing is for Twitch to match donated bits to a charity
[4:02:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah Shimano's an asshole. I stopped after this. I'll go back eventually.
[4:02:40] <majindusto> Good, Fortnite deserves suing for using peoples dances without permission or credit
[4:02:42] <takiyami> I think this fight took me a solid hour IIRC. So yeah...
[4:02:48] <+JohnTimbre> This fight isn't to bad if you rush him with quick combos,
[4:02:48] <KilroyGrin532> its like fighting a grab character in a fighting game LUL
[4:02:50] <+Mr_Pylon> Grab dad Shimano not having it
[4:02:52] <TalisKanju> 気持ちぃぃぃ．．．❣

[4:03:20] <Archmortal> at least this will teach him how to do finishers
[4:03:21] <+Cptn_Turtle> makes sense
[4:03:21] <%CurrySauseBandit> This fight goes a lot faster when you're not getting hit at the highest point of the heat bar. Several heat actions and the lamps make this fight short usually.
[4:03:21] <malletman241> dont put that imperialist shit on elmo

[4:03:50] <+paladinstarbuster> youre not doing kiwami moves
[4:03:50] <+subdude_> This took forever when I did it.
[4:03:51] <@SSaryn> Sadly it's due to the Kiwami system.
[4:03:51] <%Agami23> shimano is just a long shitty fight
[4:03:52] <rosencruez> everyone spam kiwami to clue pat in
[4:03:52] <%Magewart> This is the jet stream sam of yakuza
[4:03:53] <horse_memes> is shimano just made of beef

[4:04:03] <+LogothX> I had this happen to me too, its bullshit
[4:04:03] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat This is a dumb fight thats made easier in NG+. It makes no sense

[4:05:12] <rosencruez> THERE
[4:05:13] <person181> yep
[4:05:13] <%PalmtopNami> kiwami moves stop the regen, you have to switch to the right style @angriestpat
[4:05:14] <%yeknomlive> there ya go. but it's for each stance right?
[4:05:14] <%TeraMercier> Load a save
[4:05:15] <martmartez> yoi bf i bet he donesnt kiss ya

[4:05:27] <suikudo> You dun goofed

[4:05:30] <%Magewart> apatWrong
[4:05:30] <flame_of_udun_> NO RUSH
[4:05:30] <+Mr_Pylon> yep
[4:05:30] <HairballCT> !uptime
[4:05:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 5m 32s.
[4:05:32] <@SSaryn> @AngriestPat Sadly, it's a slog otherwise.
[4:05:32] <NeekOleek> tmyea
[4:05:32] <+UnderpaidBob> specifically rush for this fight
[4:05:33] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah the Shimano fight is badly designed for beginners
[4:05:33] <rosencruez> NO EXP
[4:05:34] <DukeMoose> theyre kinda... real import
[4:05:34] <CastellanVon> @AngriestPat I've been spamming you all stream to get those ASAP!
[4:05:34] <NeekOleek> yes
[4:05:35] <cowardlord> good luck
[4:05:35] <%Magewart> PAT
[4:05:35] <silvcrest> !uptime
[4:05:35] <%Toynota10> So yeah get fucked! You gotta do it the hard way (like I did)
[4:05:35] <rosencruez> THE FOOL
[4:05:35] <OwlLightningMage> He finally got there LUL
[4:05:36] <person181> he's annoying but eh
[4:05:38] <%Keyd00d> It's not Pat's fault the game was made badly
[4:05:38] <Archmortal> Where's the essence of extreme dragon
[4:05:40] <troxcree> pretty much the most important skills for boss fights.
[4:05:41] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Yep
[4:05:42] <NeekOleek> they make the fight so much easier
[4:05:44] <%yeknomlive> i beelined those moves so i never really had a problem with this boss. But one of the majima fights did give me a hard time
[4:05:45] <+Fallout48> Mega importante
[4:05:45] <disflipmat> Pat you can also use a weapon attack if you have heat to cancel their heal
[4:05:46] <colzack_> It's still doable it's just harder
[4:05:47] <$ooblagis> Dragon is from Majima
[4:05:47] <%FrustratedAF> These trees just make me wanto to play yakuzee that much more
[4:05:48] <Fordlotus> Lets do it the KIWAMI way !!
[4:05:49] <%captainthunderwolf> There goes Pat, wasting CP on stream.
[4:05:49] <Sunditsu> Its fine, fights will just be a lot longer
[4:05:50] <+Awesomeorangeman> Shimano glows pink so you need the rush Kiwami move for him
[4:05:51] <horse_memes> to be fair the design here is kinda...
[4:05:52] <thecatfishwriter> @angriestpat Will I miss out on much by playing the PS2 versions of Yakuza 1 and 2?
[4:05:53] <Epic_of_Enkidu> You can do it without the Kiwami moves, but its a bitch and a half
[4:05:54] <flame_of_udun_> @keyd00d it’s honestly just this fight
[4:05:57] <%Zombino924> apatPat apatFist
[4:05:59] <+LogothX> bad design
[4:05:59] <+KingdomKey99> they really should have been unlocked by default
[4:06:00] <rockworm> so this early in the game you have to spend xp in a very specific way.......
[4:06:00] <%comb711> Oh yeah, this fight is a huge difficulty spike
[4:06:00] <+SaltStarHero> And do some big dick damage
[4:06:10] <sparrrow_> Hey Pat any plans to take over the Kingdom Hearts LP?
[4:06:10] <bunbundabuni> no biggie, jus moar panchi
[4:06:12] <%bedsheetninja> Beyblade attacks too stronk
[4:06:13] <%hextonegaming> It's not a big deal, if there's environment shit you can use still use it, but rush and beast will get you through the rest @AngriestPat
[4:06:13] <BeeNoons> kuze spin moves
[4:06:15] <OwlLightningMage> They really should give the moves by default
[4:06:15] <dekkitout> ugh big chip damage
[4:06:16] <Windermelon> did you visit utsonomiya bob? if so, equip the fish
[4:06:16] <justdukefreeman> a good alt to the finishers is just using a weapon
[4:06:16] <exploitativity2> feels like you get fucked on progression in an arbitrary manner
[4:06:16] <artoflec> the ps2 design is still very clear despite being remade lol
[4:06:16] <%Keyd00d> @flame_of_udun_ It'd just be a lot better if he had maybe half the health he does
[4:06:20] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Having to buy them is pretty lame tbf
[4:06:21] <+SuichiTanaka> It's REALLY dumb that you have to do a specific game system that is totally optional.
[4:06:21] <DuoScratch> FUGGIN WHALE ON "EM!
[4:06:22] <+Mr_Pylon> Do any Heat Move, and that stops the regen for a it iirc
[4:06:23] <tank7013> @AngriestPat They glow the color of the style you need to be in to do the move
[4:06:25] <%Taisuru> USE DRAGON STYLE PAT
[4:06:25] <Bouldus> fuggins :D
[4:06:26] <Run44forrest> so if you dont do the dragon style bullshit you dont get the essence of extreme dragon and cant do shit when nishki heals
[4:06:29] <CastellanVon> The Kiwami System is super fucked in this game. It's done SO much better in Kiwami 2.
[4:06:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "This isn't your funeral but it's about to be if you don't drink those staminans!"
[4:06:36] <flame_of_udun_> @keyd00d no arguments here
[4:06:37] <stay_hydrated_bob> DRAGON SUCKS NO @Taisuru
[4:06:37] <majindusto> SHAKEDOWN SHAKEDOWN
[4:06:37] <Archmortal> something tells me trading hits with this guy is not very effective
[4:06:37] <HeadsHeldHigh> whats the time on this dumb fight
[4:06:37] <CastellanVon> Dragon Style is so awful
[4:06:39] <Endocrom> Color coded, eh?
[4:06:39] <stay_hydrated_bob> This early anyways
[4:06:43] <ape_hawk> a donation is just a hallmark card that doesnt go towards a horrible company
[4:06:43] <%AlasterAngelo> Kiwami is the only Yakuza game I honestly say is bad
[4:06:44] <+Cptn_Turtle> Hes eatin those punches
[4:06:46] <tmix1600> They fix this in Kiwami 2 right?
[4:06:46] <stay_hydrated_bob> It's OP as shit later on
[4:06:49] <martmartez> item used rank down
[4:06:51] <%Toynota10> 3 MINUTES TILL CHRISTMAS EVERYONE
[4:06:53] <+bigbradish> I literally left for 5 minutes this fight is still going on?
[4:06:53] <stay_hydrated_bob> but rn theres a 2 hit combo and thats it
[4:06:56] <AMstone776> eyyy Pat sup.
[4:06:56] <%comb711> Yeah dragon style just feels bad
[4:06:56] <%Keeble24> Is rush style still pretty fucked in this game??
[4:06:58] <%AlasterAngelo> @tmix1600 Kiwami 2 doesn't even have this system
[4:07:00] <%Keyd00d> Kiwami 2 is much better yeah
[4:07:02] <@SSaryn> @tmix1600 Kiwami 2 doesn't even use this system.
[4:07:04] <flame_of_udun_> @tmix1600 Kiwami moves aren’t even in it so yes
[4:07:05] <stay_hydrated_bob> also same @bigbradish
[4:07:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Kiwami 2 runs off the dragon engine so yeah.
[4:07:06] <Run44forrest> dragon is okay when you get the speed up
[4:07:07] <tmix1600> PFFFTTT
[4:07:08] <+Jordan_z123> This fight took me forever kinda glad I’m not the only one
[4:07:09] <foreverN2dust> get good pat
[4:07:13] <booglesnurf> Pat wants just the tip
[4:07:17] <+theAncopro> love this 4 second song loop
[4:07:17] <nivlac_555> H A N A S E
[4:07:18] <%ECRead> Rush is super good in this game
[4:07:19] <+FackinCrazy> LMAO im still laughing about the bacon story hahah
[4:07:20] <tank7013> @Archmortal It's kinda the only way to fight him this early without grinding levels though, which is why this fight is a pain
[4:07:21] <thecatfishwriter> This kiwamo 1 salt
[4:07:21] <%cherubsanonymous> It's so fucking good though
[4:07:23] <%spacedroner1> Is he just reusing Mr. Shakedown's moveset or did Shakedown steal it from him
[4:07:24] <ebonifragaria> god that game is long, he's not kidding
[4:07:26] <suikudo> Paige play dragons dogma!
[4:07:26] <Archmortal> Okami would be great for streaming if bosses didn't repeat like three times
[4:07:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Pat does well in rush style, then decides to stop doing rush style.
[4:07:30] <viewtifulr> whats stopping you now?
[4:07:33] <%Keyd00d> GRAB
[4:07:33] <NeekOleek> dragon is grest once u get combo speed up
[4:07:33] <+ChaosVulpes> Oh god, I want to see Paige struggle with the simplest puzzles in Okami!
[4:07:34] <+nova12833> IT"S NOT THAT LONG JESUS
[4:07:35] <Sgt_Blackjack> enemies regening health and requiring special kiwami moves is unique to this game, why it was added who knows bldfSHRUG
[4:07:35] <stay_hydrated_bob> this fight is only hard without Beast Kiwami
[4:07:36] <blademaster247> Any chance of Paige playing L.A. Noire?
[4:07:39] <%MelBrooksKA> Fuggins was streaming Okami... then he stopped BibleThump
[4:07:39] <hazardkujacker> @tmix1600 they do fix it in Kiwami 2, but mainly because that game runs on the dragon engine which brings it's own set of issues if you only started playing at 0
[4:07:40] <tmix1600> THATS A WAY TO FIX IT I GUESS
[4:07:41] <%Magewart> COME ON
[4:07:41] <Naho_Saenoki> @spacedroner1 Shakedown took his moves.
[4:07:41] <+aslfrasle> HE SAYS WHILE PLAYIING YAKUZA
[4:07:42] <waifoong98> Opppphs
[4:07:43] <%Toynota10> Its not your fault Pat. It's kinda bad game design honestly
[4:07:43] <ape_hawk> oh, woooooof
[4:07:43] <+cuttlecrow> these two men are just full of beef
[4:07:46] <Nova712> lobosSad

[4:07:48] <garbageheaphound> woof
[4:07:49] <ssks123> @AngriestPat i might be wrong, but i remember even with the heat move it still took forever to beat some bosses
[4:07:49] <Plague_bagel> chain grabs, what is this brawl?
[4:07:51] <Josef_Stryker> Mega Oof
[4:07:51] <%otakuisaiah> Big OOF

[4:07:55] <AMstone776> oof
[4:07:57] <noremac64> All the bosses in Kiwami 1 suck.

[4:40:32] <kamen_advent> Bethesda is banning Modders under the guise of them "cheating"
[4:40:34] <$correctedsun117> Never read donations, receive infinite money
[4:40:35] <+Tenchi_G> LUL
[4:40:36] <Pablo_Gonzalo> they're giving away the good fallout games
[4:40:37] <$Retrocop87> "The email reads, "This account has violated the Code of Conduct and Terms of Service by cheating. This account was detected to be running a third-party application, which provides an unfair in-game advantage, while logged onto Fallout 76." The bright spot here is that the bans that Bethesda is handing out aren't permanent; it lets players appeal the ban by writing an essay on why using third-party apps to cheat is bad."
