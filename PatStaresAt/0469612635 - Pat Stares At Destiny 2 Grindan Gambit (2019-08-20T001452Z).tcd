[0:20:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat So I know you are a warlock, but how much does that matter? Because I recall the differences in classes from D1 being minimal

[0:23:29] <KleptoBismol45> hunters are cool but titans have PUNCH
[0:23:29] <%Iccirrus> just have to abuse the controller benefits like the ridiculous sniper aim assist
[0:23:37] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat I was thinking of getting back into the game based on your gushing but I uninstalled it from the Battlenet launcher. Should I just wait for the Steam version or whatever?
[0:23:39] <+Tiewolf> you gett to peepee on the BBs

[0:26:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> your head touched your ass
[0:26:12] <+GreenCMD> go back to ricochet
[0:26:13] <xXFlyingBrickXx> yep...
[0:26:13] <startstoprepeat> ricochet is top tier
[0:26:15] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Yep... thats a PvP
[0:26:19] <%Nobrev> ricochet is gonna be more useful
[0:26:31] <TheIndigoLlama> Pat got the god roll Antiope PogChamp
[0:26:38] <+GreenCMD> ricochet is probably the best perk for 80% of guns.
[0:26:41] <+CronoMagnum> Does Pat play on PC or PS4?
[0:26:45] <%ColonelRozum> FailFish
[0:26:46] <%totesmcgoat_> Stick with the pulse for this map. Lot of long to medium range encounters
[0:26:48] <ChoculaUltra> PC
[0:26:50] <%Iccirrus> PC w/ controller
[0:26:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> You can't escape up pat
[0:26:55] <%GarbageNirvana> So for folks here who play warlocks, do y'all typically find the healing rift or the damage rift to be more useful?
[0:26:56] <+CronoMagnum> Cool, thanks
[0:26:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> same
[0:27:00] <%Iccirrus> healing rift

[0:27:01] <+flexin_apex> Pat playing mp wut
[0:27:02] <+Vikingdeath1> thats how i'd play if I was on PC
[0:27:03] <%Iccirrus> 100%
[0:27:03] <Aydarkzero> Ricochet is in fact better
[0:27:08] <%Iccirrus> if I need the damage buff I run well
[0:27:08] <%riantDeliration> it bugs me how much of the screen is taken up by Gun for a lot of weapons
[0:27:15] <+Vikingdeath1> that was a bad range for that SMG
[0:27:15] <AMDBR9S> that aim
[0:27:17] <%ColonelRozum> get good
[0:27:19] <OthoZen> woof on that one
[0:27:19] <%ssjklyco> Lame it out

[0:27:58] <%President_Miyazaki> There, apparently I needed to reload twitch chat 3 times to get it to actually work.
[0:27:59] <%Gray_skies1993> so close to mutual kill last one
[0:28:02] <%UltraViolet371> Wow, haven't touched this mode yet. This game consistently baffles me. I like it...

[0:28:05] <%aishman> Man, I can't wait for Destiny to come out on Steam
[0:28:05] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Why are you using a controller on a PC game? Shouldn't you be using the obviously superior DDR pad or steering wheel?

[0:32:13] <%weissguard> If I was Green, I would die.
[0:32:13] <%Kenori> You're always blue. They are always red.
[0:32:14] <%demegodz> Your team always blue
[0:32:18] <+Astral_Directive> Red team always wins. It‚Äôs really unbalanced
[0:32:22] <hippieofdeath> I'm blue dabadee dabada
[0:32:22] <KnightAsteran> is pat on PC?
[0:32:24] <cascadepersona> @totesmcgoat_ Make sure your RTX is on
[0:32:27] <+Sibroma> Gold team rules
[0:32:27] <+DomunDomunDomun> Remember the High Score Girl's author's series about a time travelling ghost abortion?
[0:32:27] <%Cirnosonic> im blue, and i live in a blue home
[0:32:32] <Tucker0603> hey @angriestpat how are you doing?
[0:32:35] <%Louie_Salmon> @angriestpat Stadia FC ambassadors are in full force in the comments of the Stadia presentation, and the video has hidden likes and dislikes.
[0:32:36] <%gespenst25> I'm blue (da ba di da ba dai)
[0:32:42] <Mrrccava> "Vagina's haunted" says Pat, "What?!" says Paige? *cocks gun* "VAGINA. HAUNTED." says Pat, putting on a scuba suit
[0:32:43] <%totesmcgoat_> @cascadepersona Always.
[0:32:45] <%Iccirrus> ayyy
[0:32:50] <%Iccirrus> that guy got dumpstered
[0:32:51] <SpaceCatStation> red is cheating, they're using teamwork
[0:32:55] <ElBuraindo> pick the orb pat
[0:32:55] <+derrigible> Imagine dying to someone on a controller
[0:32:59] <+Pyroclase> You gonna grind for Redrix's Broadsword?
[0:33:04] <%HeySeuss> I respect the hell out of you for going double primary pat
[0:33:04] <davidevans799> @AngriestPat I use controller on PC and im better than most keyboard players
[0:33:05] <+Pyroclase> Only requires like five valor resets
[0:33:05] <%Iccirrus> A lot of people die to me on controller
[0:33:06] <%xbalmorax> Woo
[0:33:07] <Kongro_> I wonder if the cross-play will matchmake based on input
[0:33:07] <%totesmcgoat_> Good ol' teamshot
[0:33:17] <%dekkitout> *Cross save
[0:33:17] <+Karasseram> stadia is in death stranding cause its already dead pre launch
[0:33:22] <+f_e_b_r_e_z_e> find boots with traction on them
[0:33:26] <%HeySeuss> I'm a coward and need my crutch 'nade launcher
[0:33:26] <%Iccirrus> because unlike most shooters, using a controller in destiny isn't a handicap
[0:33:41] <+aslfrasle> I just hope that crossplay lets me gets my veteran stuff off of PS4 and on to PC.
[0:33:42] <%arcaderabbit48> D2 has pretty heavy aim assist, so playing with controller isnt a big difference is it?
[0:33:43] <%President_Miyazaki> Because big aim assist for big boys
[0:33:45] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat well I was gonna offer my help once again but we have the mother of all thunderstorms here
[0:33:45] <Dao_Puppy> How big is the auto aim in this game? I need to know so I can mock accordingly.
[0:33:47] <$valriot> yeyeye Last Word bois
[0:33:52] <+Javaa01> And it's aggressive autoaim
[0:33:53] <%demegodz> Baited
[0:33:54] <Fujioko> Is it worth trying to do the Heroes Of Solstice this late into the event?
[0:33:56] <%Zamorouskiwhich> FeelsBadMan
[0:33:58] <%Kenori> Countered AGAIN
[0:34:01] <SpaceCatStation> feels bad LUL
[0:34:01] <Quigsies> @angriestpat did you see clemps‚Äô impression of you?
[0:34:14] <%Zamorouskiwhich> @Fujioko It would be a hard grind, but technically possible.
[0:34:14] <+redribbonvinny> @pyroclase oof grinding Redrix on PC is a no from me.
[0:34:15] <%Kenori> Last Word is so damn GOOOOOOOOOOD
[0:34:18] <Stomoman> Trying to cap tomestones on XIV since I played D2 all week instead, but now I wish I was doing this
[0:34:19] <KnightAsteran> @fujioko i did it in like two and a half days
[0:34:20] <%demegodz> @Fujioko You can try, but it will be hours to get that armor for even one character
[0:34:23] <TheHeroAppears> @Quigsies do you have a clip?
[0:34:27] <%President_Miyazaki> That absolutely hit them, did 91 damage to 3 guys.
[0:34:28] <danknugglit> Is this the goku warframe
[0:34:28] <%Iccirrus> @Fujioko You can probably knock out one armor set if you put the time in
[0:34:35] <+Pyroclase> I only went for the Broadsword because I was unepmployed and bored out of my mind.
[0:34:37] <%QueequegTheater> PFFT HA
[0:34:41] <+xBolts4Lifex> USDA approved LUL
[0:34:46] <+Pyroclase> I cheesed for REcluse and Mountaintop tbh
[0:34:47] <%demegodz> Yes, by one
[0:34:48] <+betrayed_llama> ye
[0:34:48] <SmarkyMC> pvp looks fun but i always get frustrated when i play jermaPluto
[0:34:50] <%demegodz> Woop
[0:34:51] <Quigsies> ***
[0:34:52] <%Iccirrus> broadsword isn't a bad grind,just long. Too bad it isn't worth it
[0:34:53] <%demegodz> Now loosing
[0:34:55] <%President_Miyazaki> o no
[0:34:56] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:34:56] <NiktenKing> HANDHELD SUPERNONOs
[0:34:56] <Quigsies> Rip LUL
[0:34:57] <%ElenaManetta> Seeing games like this makes me realize holy fuck, TF2 is so goddamn slow. You die in most online shooters in 2 seconds
[0:35:01] <%TubeMan642> @AngriestPat you gotta get geomag stabilizers they make chaos reach better
[0:35:01] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Handheld supernova balanced FeelsBadMan
[0:35:02] <%Iccirrus> fucking strikers.
[0:35:03] <%totesmcgoat_> The only thing about controllers on PC for Destiny is the verticality and look sensitivity. A good pvper can get up close and outrun your look speed
[0:35:08] <davidevans799> bottom tree strijker is reediculous
[0:35:12] <Kongro_> Striker is so awesome man
[0:35:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> that guy just killed 4 of your tream
[0:35:12] <xXFlyingBrickXx> Jesus that Titan destroyed your team
[0:35:13] <%ElenaManetta> TF2 can have like, a fucking army raining down on you and you might live
[0:35:13] <AJYoungGun> Ah GG, that super will last to the end of the game
[0:35:13] <+betrayed_llama> Bottom tree striker NotLikeThis
[0:35:14] <%dekkitout> And now for that SAME STRIKER to kill him
[0:35:18] <%Iccirrus> yeah, you have to play in the right ranges with a controller
[0:35:18] <%Kenori> There goes your team. Fucking strikers
[0:35:18] <%QueequegTheater> @ElenaManetta Yeah TF2 is pretty glacial, but it's also old
[0:35:22] <%HeySeuss> Oh boy trample titans
[0:35:25] <%Iccirrus> but you can still clap some cheeks
[0:35:27] <%HeySeuss> What a fun and fair super
[0:35:27] <%Diabetic> Destiny feels like it wanted to be Warframe for those that haven't heard of Warframe
[0:35:28] <TheIndigoLlama> OEM bottom tree striker titans in QP FeelsBadMan
[0:35:34] <%FrustratedAF> did pat spill his gamescom opinions yet?
[0:35:34] <%President_Miyazaki> Red team does always win, you were told.
[0:35:38] <%DoktorZee> sad i gotta go to work but glad i got to stop by! have fun enjoyin D2 pat
[0:35:40] <SpaceCatStation> how is he still going? I thought arc day was yesterday does that super just last forever?
[0:35:42] <%Iccirrus> warframe and destiny are pretty much nothing alike
[0:35:47] <%FrustratedAF> apparently Remothered is the successor to the clock tower series?
[0:35:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Just barely
[0:35:49] <Delenay> dont be the death that loses the game
[0:35:50] <%Iccirrus> it actually annoys me when people try to compare them
[0:35:51] <%Zamorouskiwhich> 1 point :(
[0:35:51] <krymzen5> so pat, u see that deathstranding gameplay? it was...something
[0:35:51] <%demegodz> By ONE
[0:35:53] <%QueequegTheater> @Diabetic the difference is Destiny 1 got good before Warframe did
[0:35:56] <+redribbonvinny> @pyroclase last season when everyone was grinding for the day one raid prep I completed my Master Smith triumph, Lunas Howl, Redrix and Recluse.
[0:35:56] <cascadepersona> LUL GG
[0:35:57] <%Deano8817> got some good hits in tho apatGib
[0:35:57] <%Micalica> WICTORY
[0:36:02] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Powerful LUL
[0:36:04] <%Diabetic> @QueequegTheater it got good?
[0:36:05] <%Gray_skies1993> that was pretty close, good job @AngriestPat
[0:36:18] <%demegodz> NICE
[0:36:20] <+Pyroclase> (that isn't a good roll at all)
[0:36:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Diabetic Taken King was pretty great
[0:36:32] <%demegodz> SHUT UP LET HIM HAVE IT
[0:36:33] <+betrayed_llama> primary ammo reserves aren't really good
[0:36:36] <%QueequegTheater> @Diabetic The Taken King is like Shadowbringers good IMO
[0:36:36] <SpaceCatStation> I see Pat now has the best looking Warlock chestpiece
[0:36:39] <DFireCreations> I just got here what's up
[0:36:39] <%Iccirrus> I mean,chestpiece rolls are usually not too impactful anyways
[0:36:48] <%President_Miyazaki> Do you not like Hand Cannons Pat?
[0:36:51] <Jack_DT> no
[0:36:51] <%QueequegTheater> Warlock Master Race
[0:36:52] <%Iccirrus> boots,gloves,and helmets are where the real shit is
[0:36:56] <+GreenCMD> It's a good roll but the real important perks are on class item and arms
[0:36:59] <%Iccirrus> that chest was your powerful drop pat
[0:37:00] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Gambino~
[0:37:06] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat it drops automatically, was probably that chestpiece
[0:37:10] <%HeySeuss> So patward, how did you enjoy the new raids?
[0:37:10] <%dekkitout> Crimson tajC
[0:37:11] <%President_Miyazaki> Crimson is great.
[0:37:14] <Tucker0603> crimson is solid
[0:37:15] <%QueequegTheater> Sturm and Drang are fucking MONSTROUS in PVP
[0:37:16] <%Iccirrus> it was just lower because it's still above your average level,it just came in the wrong slot unfortunately
[0:37:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> is Better Devils still good?
[0:37:20] <%dekkitout> Get an Ace, lad
[0:37:20] <Sullry> Play gambit to get a god trust
[0:37:25] <$valriot> Done any Exotic quests?
[0:37:27] <+jordanstayshome> crimson is a solid gun but ace is like a minimum requirement
[0:37:27] <%TubeMan642> Trust is a good handcannon
[0:37:28] <NiktenKing> Crimson is only good with catalyst
[0:37:30] <KnightAsteran> I just finished the Last Word quest like 19 minutes ago
[0:37:30] <Tucker0603> STURM AND DRANG ARE MY SHIT!
[0:37:31] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Crimson is pretty alright
[0:37:33] <%totesmcgoat_> You'll want Crimson for the Shattered Throne in a couple weeks
[0:37:33] <Sullry> That or ace of spades exotic quest
[0:37:33] <+Vikingdeath1> Crimson is Fantastic. don't listen to no hate.
[0:37:34] <%President_Miyazaki> Also yeah, do the quest to get the Ace of Spades.
[0:37:42] <%arcaderabbit48> What kind of Pact does Pat have for his Warlock? Great Old One?
[0:37:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Gambit's probably my favorite mode in this game
[0:37:46] <+betrayed_llama> ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT
[0:37:47] <%aishman> Did you buy the Annual Pass?
[0:37:50] <%QueequegTheater> Where's my damn Tlaloc Bungie? BibleThump
[0:37:52] <%castarts> DING
[0:37:54] <KleptoBismol45> Ace of Spades is very cool and very stylish
[0:37:57] <+demon1103> i LOVE my sunshot handcannon, kill one guy and everyone just chain explodes
[0:37:57] <%Kenori> Or last word
[0:37:58] <%Zamorouskiwhich> If you have the Chalice, running Menagerie is really fun apatSmug
[0:38:02] <+Pyroclase> If you get Trust from gambit, that one's pretty good
[0:38:03] <$valriot> Ace of Spades is GODLIKE
[0:38:04] <%President_Miyazaki> Get Sturm and Drang to use in Crucible.
[0:38:07] <ChoculaUltra> Crimson still has it's Y1 ttk but it's solid for what it does. Just don't get frustrated when you get outgunned by a Last Word or Ace.
[0:38:10] <KnightAsteran> just get Trust from Gambit rooKb
[0:38:11] <OthoZen> trash roll
[0:38:11] <%dekkitout> What happened to Better Devils?
[0:38:11] <%President_Miyazaki> It's also from quests.
[0:38:13] <Tucker0603> DUDE THAT'S SOLID
[0:38:14] <%totesmcgoat_> Pull out year 1 better devils
[0:38:15] <%QueequegTheater> D1 Tlaloc > Ace of Spades >>>>>> Titan Exotic
[0:38:15] <+Vikingdeath1> oof, yeah, don't use one of THOSE hand cannons in crucible, heh
[0:38:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> Sweet Buisness is my favorite gun. MORE DAKA!
[0:38:16] <+jordanstayshome> get the ikelos one so you can get sleeper too
[0:38:21] <%aishman> Fuck I wanna play Destiny 2 again. Fucking come out on Steam already
[0:38:23] <Sullry> Nah just use a better devils from collection
[0:38:24] <$AgentTexes> @AngriestPat Get a Better Devils from Shax
[0:38:24] <%demegodz> Just have RNG work for you, 4head
[0:38:27] <Punisher7771> truth is a good one
[0:38:46] <+Pyroclase> Even Better Devils
[0:38:46] <%dekkitout> Betterer Devils
[0:38:48] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Old Better Devils is still pretty okay
[0:38:48] <%totesmcgoat_> Pull out the old one
[0:38:51] <+jordanstayshome> grind Gambit until you get truth. truth is top tier.
[0:38:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> aww, better devils sucks? :(
[0:39:01] <ChoculaUltra> so you won't use a good gun because you don't have the better version of it? seems kind've counter intuitive.
[0:39:04] <+redribbonvinny> he doesnt have the spicy devils
[0:39:06] <%President_Miyazaki> Gotta update the wombware
[0:39:08] <+Pyroclase> Spare Rations is VERY hard to get.
[0:39:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> @jordanstayshome I thought Truth was a rocket launcher?
[0:39:10] <%HeySeuss> Year one hand cannon is actually good for PvP
[0:39:13] <%Iccirrus> spare rations is great if you can get a good roll
[0:39:13] <Thalchampz> hi pat, hi chat
[0:39:14] <%Kenori> TRUTH GANG
[0:39:15] <+betrayed_llama> Spare rations is top tier
[0:39:15] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Truth (Handcannon) is great
[0:39:16] <%Iccirrus> trust is as well
[0:39:18] <NiktenKing> Trust
[0:39:18] <%HeySeuss> Year one raid*
[0:39:19] <$valriot> Spare Rations is ABSURDLY good
[0:39:20] <+Pyroclase> Trust is the handcannon, truth is a rocket launcher
[0:39:21] <startstoprepeat> spare rations is a pain to grind, but they're gonna patch it in like two weeks
[0:39:24] <%totesmcgoat_> Truth is a rocket launcher
[0:39:26] <+JavaManJoJo> My dad was in here talking to me earlier while you were talking about haunted baginas and auto abortions.
[0:39:27] <Tucker0603> truth is an exotic rocket launcher
[0:39:28] <%dekkitout> Trust, Truth is the busted-in-Gambit rpg
[0:39:29] <Sullry> You have to grind reckoning to get spare rations
[0:39:30] <%President_Miyazaki> Also yeah Pat do the quest to get Sturm and Drang, Sturm 2 taps at crazy ranges
[0:39:31] <%Kenori> Truth Gang Ror Crucible!
[0:39:32] <%Iccirrus> It's Trust @Zamorouskiwhich
[0:39:33] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Gah, fudge it IS Trust isnt it
[0:39:38] <%GarbageNirvana> I've got an auto rifle I got from forges that I really enjoy myself
[0:39:39] <%Iccirrus> ye
[0:39:40] <%GarbageNirvana> But I'm a weirdo
[0:39:42] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat To be fair Warlocks in D1 were far and away the best class in pvp because of their class exotic (an above average scout rifle called Tlaloc, but when your super is popped it gets double fire rate, accuracy, and recoil reduction)
[0:39:43] <+jordanstayshome> a 140 rpm handcannon is good regardless of perks
[0:39:45] <+Solideva> you need to see the new death Stranding trailer
[0:39:47] <%Iccirrus> trust carried me to Luna
[0:39:48] <$valriot> Could get Last Word for big cowboy meme dunking
[0:39:48] <%demegodz> Trust, the handcannon people are talking about probably
[0:39:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Truth has some BULLSHIT tracking
[0:39:50] <KnightAsteran> Trust is the Gambit handcannon, I love it for PvP
[0:39:50] <%QueequegTheater> But they be nerfed
[0:39:51] <%totesmcgoat_> Did you ever get Midnight Coup from Levi?
[0:39:52] <%Kenori> TRUTH GANG TRUTH GANG
[0:39:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Truth is a rocket launcher, and Happiness is a warm gun
[0:39:52] <+jordanstayshome> sorry 180
[0:39:55] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat Kindled Orchid from Black Armory is pretty nice. plus that one will also help with the Thorn quest later
[0:39:56] <NiktenKing> Orchid is also pretty good
[0:40:00] <based_lobster> Awwww yeah. Space sipsipDab
[0:40:00] <%Iccirrus> 180s are the best feeling hand cannons on controllers
[0:40:00] <startstoprepeat> do not bring a sword
[0:40:04] <Punisher7771> max power is 750 pat
[0:40:04] <+talon84> You poor sweet summer child
[0:40:05] <%aishman> So wait Pat, you bought Forssaken and Annual Pass or just Forsaken?
[0:40:09] <+talon84> not even close
[0:40:09] <+AngrySpaceLlama51> You can get the service revolver from strikes
[0:40:15] <+Pyroclase> oh no he's playing NORMAL Gambit
[0:40:18] <$AgentTexes> @AngriestPat But if you use the Better Devils you already have in collections you can get the better exotic handcannon faster.
[0:40:19] <%Iccirrus> Yeah, they have very little visual recoil
[0:40:21] <%Iccirrus> and no bloom
[0:40:23] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat if you get decnt with drang then Sturm and Drang kick ass
[0:40:25] <%Kenori> "give taste good in chili! Yum!"
[0:40:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> Pat, do you have a *dab* emote?
[0:40:26] <%castarts> TRUST
[0:40:27] <NiktenKing> Malfeasance is best spamcannon
[0:40:30] <TheHeroAppears> is this the index
[0:40:33] <%President_Miyazaki> Sturm is my favorite hand cannon and you can't change my mind.
[0:40:37] <%Diabetic> really hope they make it to like actual levels rather than the goofy light level thing when Bungie takes over
[0:40:38] <%Iccirrus> bloom fucks with non 180 hand cannons super hard
[0:40:39] <%Gray_skies1993> @Order_of_Mystery apatDab
[0:40:40] <%Diabetic> *already takes over
[0:40:41] <%HeySeuss> Wait he is at 700 with max level? He is primed for solstice
[0:40:43] <%TubeMan642> He might get Trust to drop from this match
[0:40:49] <%dekkitout> @TheHeroAppears Actually, yeah, it kind is
[0:40:51] <%Iccirrus> well, non-180s except for luna's howl or Not Forgotten
[0:40:52] <ChoculaUltra> ran a team of 4 Malfeasances to get Luna's and NF. It was dirty af but it got the job done.
[0:40:54] <%QueequegTheater> Sturm and Drang are terrible for bosses but they're literally top tier everywhere else
[0:40:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I like Sturm, I just wish you didn't have to have Drang to maximize its potential
[0:41:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> apatDab dab in-game you coward! apatDab
[0:41:09] <+strugglesv> Pat what happened to your baby gaming station
[0:41:12] <ChoculaUltra> funny thing about Malfeasance, you can trigger the explosion with any 5 shots, not just your own.
[0:41:19] <KnightAsteran> I need a Baroque Drang
[0:41:20] <%Iccirrus> oh fuck this map
[0:41:25] <%Iccirrus> this map can go right to hell
[0:41:36] <+redribbonvinny> man it is so weird hearing all this PC hand cannon love when your a console main
[0:41:37] <%Gray_skies1993> MOON WIZARD
[0:41:38] <KnightAsteran> yup this is the worst Gambit ma0
[0:41:41] <Tucker0603> yeah this map sucks
[0:41:46] <%Iccirrus> 5-10-15 for blockers pat
[0:41:47] <%GarbageNirvana> oof
[0:41:48] <SpaceCatStation> nooooo
[0:41:50] <%Iccirrus> nope
[0:41:50] <%Kenori> Oi
[0:41:51] <Punisher7771> got to greedy
[0:41:52] <+Pyroclase> no they do not
[0:41:52] <%Iccirrus> they just go away
[0:41:53] <Punisher7771> no
[0:41:54] <%Nobrev> nope
[0:41:55] <SpaceCatStation> nope they're just gone now
[0:41:55] <+informedotaku> what's wrong with it?
[0:41:56] <%Zamorouskiwhich> They gone
[0:41:56] <xXFlyingBrickXx> no lol
[0:41:56] <KnightAsteran> @redribbonvinny im on console, Trust kicks ass
[0:41:57] <Yrefe> nope
[0:41:57] <+jordanstayshome> no
[0:42:00] <Tucker0603> the Titan Gambit prime map is the best
[0:42:02] <+betrayed_llama> unless your a collector
[0:42:02] <Yrefe> too cocky son
[0:42:04] <%Laecerelius> Is Pat playing Index?
[0:42:06] <%dekkitout> Welcome to Gambit, BRING A SWORD tajC
[0:42:08] <DFireCreations> poof
[0:42:09] <+talon84> coxWat
[0:42:09] <%demegodz> 5-10-15
[0:42:10] <%President_Miyazaki> You have fucked up now.
[0:42:12] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Trust is one of the best controller handcannons in the gam and is a random Gambit drop.
[0:42:12] <%Iccirrus> @Michael_Erazo lots of bullshit instadeath falls
[0:42:12] <SpaceCatStation> your actions have consequences
[0:42:13] <ChuckMagnus> Commence steam roll
[0:42:14] <Tucker0603> pro tip, didn't die with motes
[0:42:18] <+Pyroclase> @Tucker0603 Actually I despise that map, it's too big and it lags a lot
[0:42:19] <+jordanstayshome> be a hero and bank every 5
[0:42:31] <%demegodz> Other side of the map, usually
[0:42:35] <+redribbonvinny> @knightasteran yeah the one you get from the drifter was what carried me to my Luna
[0:42:39] <+SpookySpaghooti> Pat be a Titan
[0:42:42] <TheHeroAppears> wait this is also pvp
[0:42:43] <LorcaNomad> it's not like warframe index lol
[0:42:45] <%Kenori> Bank every 5/10
[0:42:46] <%FrostMass22> FrostMass22 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Happy 9 months. stream babby growing strong. Also, apparently you can piss in Death Stranding? Kojima was very specific about how you can't see Norman Redus penis though.
[0:42:46] <%Iccirrus> The invader will only spawn in a quadrant where enemies aren't currently spawning
[0:42:46] <OthoZen> you can get a perk that lets those motes drop on the floor in gambit prime
[0:42:48] <%Nobrev> kill those blockers ASAP @AngriestPat
[0:42:49] <Tucker0603> @pyroclase but using the rings to speed around is fun as hell
[0:42:51] <SpaceCatStation> oh wow jeez a machine gun in crucible why didn't I think of that
[0:42:53] <Punisher7771> stop being bad pat
[0:42:55] <%President_Miyazaki> Oh hey, he shot you from across the map with an LMG. Never seen that before.
[0:42:56] <%totesmcgoat_> LMGs, the best sniper rifles
[0:42:56] <%Iccirrus> Luna's howl is a pinnacle PvP hand cannon
[0:42:59] <SpaceCatStation> err in gambit oops
[0:43:01] <nademonkey1100> moons haunted
[0:43:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> princess luna?
[0:43:04] <SpaceCatStation> sarcasm is ruined
[0:43:05] <+Pyroclase> @Tucker0603 I'll grant that, those rings are a blast
[0:43:06] <%HeySeuss> A machine gun in gambit, what a surpriiiiiiise
[0:43:07] <+SpookySpaghooti> Luna very fancy
[0:43:08] <+informedotaku> @iccirrus oh ok. Had happened a few times on my end but not enough that I hate it
[0:43:09] <%Iccirrus> Need to get to 2100 in competitive
[0:43:14] <%Iccirrus> it isn't as good as it used to be
[0:43:16] <%demegodz> the Taken are blockers, keep you from deposting
[0:43:19] <%GarbageNirvana> I love that super
[0:43:24] <+redribbonvinny> @spookyspaghooti well was fancy
[0:43:24] <%President_Miyazaki> Blockers dropping motes would kind of defeat the point of sending blockers.
[0:43:24] <%dekkitout> Invader spawns are still easily manipulable once learned
[0:43:25] <DarthBane98> Blockers (Taken) don't drop Motes
[0:43:27] <NiktenKing> Lunafaction and Luna's Howl
[0:43:28] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat pinnacle PvP handcannon
[0:43:34] <%Iccirrus> don't punch the blue bois
[0:43:37] <%Iccirrus> big splode
[0:43:42] <%croxeye> lunas=lunafaction boots an exotic leg piece for warlocks which eliminates reloading in well, or luna's howl which is a pinnacle pvp hand canon only available from the comp playlist
[0:43:44] <$AgentTexes> Why are people talking about Luna? Not like Pat can get it by himself. He'd need a carry.
[0:43:45] <+Pyroclase> BANK NOW
[0:43:47] <+Pyroclase> oh
[0:43:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Shoulda banked
[0:43:48] <%totesmcgoat_> bank
[0:43:53] <%demegodz> Shoulda banked
[0:43:55] <TheHeroAppears> pat
[0:43:59] <Punisher7771> its the ocd
[0:44:01] <%President_Miyazaki> Gambit sucks: Fact.
[0:44:04] <%Nobrev> apatSkelmoney apatSkelmoney apatSkelmoney TOO GREEDY
[0:44:06] <+aslfrasle> Pat is sad now.
[0:44:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're saving Norman Reedus's penis for the Kiwami version, so they can implement the Norman Reedus' Penis Everwhere system
[0:44:06] <%Iccirrus> gambit is great
[0:44:07] <%Kenori> Pat is the kind of Gambit player I rage at.
[0:44:11] <based_lobster> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:44:11] <anar_bael> Where do you bank
[0:44:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Cause he'd die immediately if he didn't
[0:44:14] <+Pyroclase> Invaders always get an overshield because it's 4v1
[0:44:15] <%Gray_skies1993> HIVE MAD (x24)
[0:44:17] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat because it's 1v4
[0:44:17] <+neojadan> Incaders spawn with an overshield
[0:44:17] <%Iccirrus> invaders get a shield because it's 1v4
[0:44:19] <%dekkitout> Because it's "Balanced"
[0:44:20] <%sjay449> because it would be 1 v 4
[0:44:21] <%totesmcgoat_> Invaders get an oversheild
[0:44:21] <%demegodz> Bank in the Middle
[0:44:22] <+neojadan> Invaders*
[0:44:23] <%Iccirrus> it wouldn't be fair otherwise
[0:44:24] <DarthBane98> Invaders get Overshield to compancate
[0:44:25] <Tucker0603> cause all invaders do
[0:44:26] <%demegodz> Yes
[0:44:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> destiny pvp in general is ass
[0:44:32] <+Pyroclase> PAt you need to be extremely careful around invaders because they can see you through walls
[0:44:33] <%HeySeuss> 1v4
[0:44:34] <%dekkitout> Invaders also can see you through walls
[0:44:35] <cisealnine> What is he playing on?
[0:44:38] <%HeySeuss> They need a crutch
[0:44:44] <+betrayed_llama> Invaders get an oversheild and wallhacks
[0:44:53] <+redribbonvinny> tbh he should probably wait for cross save and get Lunas Howl on ps4. ps4 is so easy compared to PC/xbox
[0:44:54] <+informedotaku> Did anyone catch what Kojima said about looking out for a star in the Gamescon trailer?
[0:44:58] <Punisher7771> pat save power armor for the boss
[0:45:19] <TheHeroAppears> @Michael_Erazo he was talking about geoff
[0:45:19] <+Pyroclase> Power Armor, pff
[0:45:20] <%totesmcgoat_> Get 5/10/15 if you can, don't be greedy and it's ok to turn in 8 or something other than a multiple of 5
[0:45:27] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat you should invade and use your Thunderlord
[0:45:34] <%enickma11> He did it Pog
[0:45:36] <%demegodz> You did it
[0:45:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Y'all are ahead now
[0:45:40] <+Pyroclase> Pat you're tap firing your SMG
[0:45:41] <+redribbonvinny> did he get the Thunderlord from a random drop?
[0:45:42] <+jordanstayshome> you have heavy, try invading
[0:45:44] <+Sibroma> You did a bonk!
[0:45:49] <anar_bael> You. Did. It
[0:45:49] <coldsama> Don't forget to use your rift sometimes
[0:45:51] <SoySocks> good afternoon pat and chat
[0:45:55] <KnightAsteran> He's learning rooPat
[0:45:59] <%demegodz> BANK
[0:46:00] <Tucker0603> you....did....something?
[0:46:02] <T_Sasquatch> There's something about destiny and that's both incredibly repetitive yet fun
[0:46:05] <%demegodz> Okay cool
[0:46:10] <%Iccirrus> can't bank now, primeval time
[0:46:10] <SpaceCatStation> noooo should have waited a bit to use chaos reach on the primeval
[0:46:12] <+betrayed_llama> The other team sucks LUL
[0:46:14] <%pilgrimsayswhat> woopsie
[0:46:15] <%demegodz> LUL
[0:46:17] <%Jaxnos> LUL
[0:46:17] <KnightAsteran> Holy shit Pats tem summoned first
[0:46:17] <%President_Miyazaki> Nice
[0:46:17] <$valriot> LUL LUL
[0:46:19] <%Iccirrus> kill the envoys
[0:46:19] <%enickma11> LUL
[0:46:20] <%croxeye> also pat you know you don't have to use 2 primaries right? you can equip special weapons in your kinetic or energy slot?
[0:46:20] <+demon1103> lol
[0:46:21] <%ArcanumMBD> pro gamer move
[0:46:21] <TheHeroAppears> lol
[0:46:21] <+informedotaku> @angriestpat suggest saving super for Invaders of primeivals
[0:46:22] <%ZizerX> apatBig
[0:46:22] <cisealnine> Wow...
[0:46:22] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:46:22] <%dekkitout> Now for the part where you're consecutively invaded
[0:46:24] <DarthBane98> Something tells me Pat won't be getting Malfeasance.
[0:46:25] <%TubeMan642> LUL
[0:46:26] <artoflec> Hi Pat and Chat I hope you are well elaSmile /
[0:46:26] <%demegodz> Kill the Wizards
[0:46:29] <%demegodz> First
[0:46:31] <%Kenori> Yeah that other team is Bads
[0:46:31] <Quigsies> LUL
[0:46:32] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat and you just learned why this map is the worst
[0:46:36] <%Starlight_Gamer> is gambit still an easy mode to play?
[0:46:39] <anar_bael> LUL
[0:46:44] <DarthBane98> lul
[0:46:46] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 7 month streak! been in Canadia for a few weeks, i watched a flock of canadian geese chase down and stole a kids sandwich. it was beautiful
[0:46:46] <krymzen5> ouch
[0:46:49] <+Bob_Tom> i see i tuned in at the right time
[0:46:49] <%demegodz> @Starlight_Gamer Eh...
[0:46:50] <Punisher7771> eeehhh some what
[0:46:55] <%Kenori> You missed every smg shot
[0:47:02] <%arcaderabbit48> "I cast Lightning Bolt."
[0:47:12] <$AgentTexes> Summoning first actually makes it easier for the other team to kill their summon. It's fucking stupid when you couple it with methods to kill the boss in seconds.
[0:47:12] <%HeySeuss> Gambit can die
[0:47:13] <+king_of_beggars> Shadowkeep trailer from Gamescon looks cool. Moon ghosts. Destiny is now a Dead Space I guess.
[0:47:27] <%dekkitout> With bottom tree too, damn son...
[0:47:28] <startstoprepeat> huh, don't see many shadow shot invaders
[0:47:29] <coldsama> @starlight_gamer Depends on your teammates but yeah, if everyone is decently equipped and know what they need to do at the right moment
[0:47:31] <DFireCreations> y3s
[0:47:31] <+neojadan> That invaders is the only reason the other team is doing okay
[0:47:32] <cisealnine> You may want to get a better primary weapon.
[0:47:33] <Tucker0603> yes
[0:47:35] <%President_Miyazaki> That's your primeval's health bar also.
[0:47:36] <+Pyroclase> @AgentTexes Actually, they changed that months ago. The second team to summon no longer gets free stacks
[0:47:37] <%HeySeuss> That... is an interesting super for gambit
[0:47:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> Carry a fusion rifle or sniper for invaders
[0:47:40] <%totesmcgoat_> Wow, bottom tree
[0:47:46] <%riantDeliration> im glad i can watch pat play gambit so i didnt have to suffer to learn i wouldnt like it
[0:47:47] <+betrayed_llama> Thay still haven't summoned a prime evil LUL
[0:47:50] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat kill the Taken Wizards, you'll be able to do more damage to the boss
[0:47:58] <$afronooch> when its yellow its the boss health bar
[0:47:59] <%President_Miyazaki> Because they were behind.
[0:48:01] <%dekkitout> Because it's "balanced"
[0:48:01] <+Pyroclase> Invaders get regular invasions furing the primeval phase, Pat
[0:48:03] <%aishman> Catch-up mechanic
[0:48:05] <%totesmcgoat_> Welcome to Gambit
[0:48:10] <krymzen5> i blame pat
[0:48:10] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat cause you have primeveal
[0:48:15] <+neojadan> @AngriestPat when you get your primeval, the other team gets to invade every 30 seconds
[0:48:17] <startstoprepeat> after the boss gets summoned, invades are constant
[0:48:19] <$valriot> Didn't help Super defense is still active right now, got nerfed in Shadowkeep tho
[0:48:19] <+informedotaku> that's what happens
[0:48:20] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Once a team summons a primeval, the portal continually resets on a cooldown
[0:48:21] <Punisher7771> you can
[0:48:23] <%Iccirrus> because your teammates are cowards
[0:48:23] <$afronooch> killing the envoys starts the buff, but the buff will start regardless after about 30 seconds or so
[0:48:26] <cisealnine> Void Bomb is the best for bosses.
[0:48:28] <%President_Miyazaki> Because you aren't going through the portal?
[0:48:29] <%demegodz> Cause no one has entered the portal
[0:48:30] <+betrayed_llama> you can l, jump into the portal
[0:48:33] <Tucker0603> hope through the portal then
[0:48:33] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Your team isn't invading them because team bad
[0:48:33] <DarthBane98> y'all can invade
[0:48:34] <LorcaNomad> The portal's right there right
[0:48:34] <+neojadan> Your invasion portal is open, you could
[0:48:42] <FennecZephyr> Or they are and you arent noticing it
[0:48:44] <%enickma11> Mmmmmm ME
[0:48:44] <Buttku> jump through the portal to invade'pat
[0:48:46] <$AgentTexes> @Pyroclase Thank god. I haven't played in a long time because I'm now living in a place with satellite internet and can't play multiplayer games anymore.
[0:48:47] <%Gray_skies1993> VICTORY apatDab PogChamp
[0:48:49] <%Kenori> You are, when only one team has a primeval the team that doesn't gets regular portals to try to come back from behimd
[0:48:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh damn is this the new crack for Pat
[0:48:52] <%totesmcgoat_> Pat won a round
[0:48:52] <%Nobrev> YOU LOST 24 MOTES lul
[0:48:52] <NiktenKing> TEAM LAZOR
[0:48:52] <%demegodz> 24 motes lost
[0:48:55] <%dekkitout> Here's hoping for a meatball spawn this round
[0:48:56] <OthoZen> thats a lot of lost motes
[0:48:56] <%President_Miyazaki> Massive 5 motes deposited.
[0:48:57] <%totesmcgoat_> Now do again
[0:48:57] <%croxeye> 24 motes lost HOLY CRAP LMAO
[0:48:57] <%riantDeliration> "round" oh my god it keeps going?
[0:48:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> TAKE THAT CRACK PAT
[0:48:59] <KleptoBismol45> you did it, very cool
[0:49:04] <startstoprepeat> he's learning, guys
[0:49:05] <anar_bael> man that 24 hurts to look at
[0:49:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's the best
[0:49:08] <TheHeroAppears> it's so long
[0:49:08] <+Pyroclase> I much prefer Gambit Prime honestly
[0:49:09] <DarthBane98> It can be. at times
[0:49:09] <+informedotaku> yeah it got me back into destiny
[0:49:10] <%President_Miyazaki> Gambit is the worst game mode.
[0:49:11] <+Pyroclase> it's faster and slicker
[0:49:11] <%croxeye> that's so bad lmao
[0:49:13] <Sullry> No
[0:49:14] <%totesmcgoat_> Gambit Prime is more refined
[0:49:14] <+neojadan> Gambit is super fun, and Gambit Prime makes it even better.
[0:49:18] <%Iccirrus> Just wait until you figure out all of the little things. You can get to be SO efficient in gambit
[0:49:19] <$afronooch> @riantDeliration yeah. regular gambit kinda drags on
[0:49:19] <%Iccirrus> it's nuts
[0:49:23] <$valriot> Have you done Gambit Prime @angriestpat ?
[0:49:26] <%demegodz> You're doing great for a second match
[0:49:31] <%galaxyswirl> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[0:49:31] <KohryuZX> is that game already free to play?
[0:49:37] <nademonkey1100> i blame the controller
[0:49:39] <%demegodz> @KohryuZX Not yet
[0:49:40] <%Iccirrus> they lock the enemie's bank
[0:49:43] <SpaceCatStation> they block
[0:49:43] <%Iccirrus> until they kill them
[0:49:43] <+redribbonvinny> your doing a lot better this time Pat
[0:49:44] <+Pyroclase> Blockers prevenbt depositing yeah
[0:49:45] <%dekkitout> Yes
[0:49:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> They block
[0:49:46] <%demegodz> Yes
[0:49:47] <+QuasartheHero> @kohryuzx thats in October
[0:49:47] <+betrayed_llama> Blockers lock the bank
[0:49:48] <%aishman> Right.
[0:49:49] <%Gray_skies1993> blocks the other team from banking @AngriestPat
[0:49:51] <%Nobrev> they block the bank until they're all killed
[0:49:51] <%SlashHabit> sends out an enemy
[0:49:53] <%totesmcgoat_> Blockers close the bank so players can't deposit motes
[0:49:53] <%Zamorouskiwhich> They can't deposit until they are killed
[0:49:53] <DarthBane98> Blockers prevent the opposing team from depositing notes
[0:49:53] <coldsama> @pyroclase Don't send him to prime yet he is not well equipped enough
[0:49:54] <%Deano8817> LUL
[0:49:54] <+informedotaku> you don't get orbs for the Solstice event in Prime if he's going for that btw
[0:49:55] <SpaceCatStation> LUL
[0:49:55] <%SlashHabit> and locks bank
[0:49:56] <%Kenori> A blocker prevents you from depositing motes until all of them are clear
[0:49:56] <%aishman> .....
[0:49:57] <StarvingPenguinGod> LUL
[0:49:57] <%Dementedpenguin> ................
[0:49:57] <+neojadan> Their bank is locked with a blocker on the field
[0:49:58] <%President_Miyazaki> They summon the taken enemies by the bank on their side and stop them from depositing until they are killed.
[0:49:58] <%Iccirrus> And that's why I hate this map
[0:49:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:49:59] <captainspauldin> they cant deposit until the blockers are dead
[0:49:59] <Sullry> Yes and are annoying
[0:50:00] <%Segartner> LUL
[0:50:00] <%castarts> OH NOOOO
[0:50:00] <%croxeye> LUL
[0:50:00] <NegaScottsuper> lol

[0:50:02] <DFireCreations> eat TANG
[0:50:03] <TheHeroAppears> patrick
[0:50:03] <%Zamorouskiwhich> This map is bad
[0:50:03] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat can't deposit and in Gambit prime they lose banked motes
[0:50:03] <%Kenori> LOL Warlock shitjumps
[0:50:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Warlock Soup
[0:50:04] <%demegodz> This map is doodoo
[0:50:04] <anar_bael> LUL
[0:50:04] <%sjay449> No one likes this map
[0:50:04] <$afronooch> LUL
[0:50:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLIP HIS FAILURE
[0:50:05] <+Pyroclase> Nobody likes this map
[0:50:05] <%SlashHabit> 5 - small 10 medium 15 big boy
[0:50:07] <%totesmcgoat_> It's a bad map
[0:50:07] <+betrayed_llama> Yeah, this map sucks
[0:50:07] <OthoZen> yup this map sucks
[0:50:10] <Punisher7771> god danmit pat
[0:50:11] <SpaceCatStation> that's just how warlocks be
[0:50:11] <%Kirby_Sauce> I like this map
[0:50:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLIP IT SO H
[0:50:12] <Tucker0603> yeah fuck this map
[0:50:12] <nademonkey1100> 28 motes lost
[0:50:14] <DarthBane98> Cathedral of Scars is my fave
[0:50:14] <+Javaa01> Just look at where you're walking, and don't read this
[0:50:14] <$afronooch> yeah no one does
[0:50:15] <+bonzosan> please nerf
[0:50:16] <$AgentTexes> Git gud
[0:50:17] <hat_under_bread> Less than an hour in and Pat is already playing a game? What is this dark magic?
[0:50:22] <%demegodz> This map is garbo
[0:50:23] <%dekkitout> If the Gambit map doesn't have teleporters, then IT'S BAD
[0:50:24] <cisealnine> You don't like it because Warlock has the worst jump in the game.
[0:50:25] <+neojadan> They're about to bank and invade, watch out
[0:50:31] <+Fifth5kee> they also send a enemy over which until it dies locks your bank
[0:50:33] <NiktenKing> This map is only good for when you have invasion quests
[0:50:35] <startstoprepeat> i suicided so much one time on this map that the game thought i was purposefully throwing it and kicked me
[0:50:40] <+neojadan> Or well, they would be if they didn't suck
[0:50:41] <%arcaderabbit48> As cool as the spell is, it doesnt feel as poowerful as it looks?
[0:50:46] <%Iccirrus> I'd bank
[0:50:46] <%Segartner> @AngriestPat you like your new kamehameha?
[0:50:53] <%croxeye> GO DEPOSIT PAT
[0:50:59] <%Iccirrus> get that portal up
[0:51:01] <TheHeroAppears> don't do it pat
[0:51:02] <%Iccirrus> so somebody can invade
[0:51:05] <LorcaNomad> CASHE
[0:51:11] <%Nobrev> pat KILL THE BLOCKERS
[0:51:12] <ElBuraindo> SLAPPED
[0:51:13] <+betrayed_llama> You should bank Pat
[0:51:14] <%enickma11> Just a little love tap
[0:51:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> Slapped
[0:51:19] <%demegodz> SLAP
[0:51:19] <nademonkey1100> 36 lost
[0:51:19] <+neojadan> Every 25 motes you bank, you get an invasion.
[0:51:20] <Punisher7771> hip fire pat
[0:51:30] <anar_bael> This Slaps
[0:51:32] <%croxeye> just bank if you get 5
[0:51:33] <+informedotaku> @angriestpat Of you enjoy Gambit, there are armors that give you perks for that mode exclusively
[0:51:33] <%Nobrev> NO
[0:51:33] <%President_Miyazaki> Because you just lost them all.
[0:51:34] <%enickma11> OH GOD NOT AGAIN PAT
[0:51:34] <%demegodz> Cause it will round down
[0:51:34] <ElBuraindo> 8 is better than ZERO
[0:51:34] <Yrefe> oh fuck off
[0:51:35] <%sjay449> so you get the motes
[0:51:35] <+Pyroclase> bank if you're in danger of losing motes basically
[0:51:36] <coldsama> Your team is bad but the ennemies are worse, lucky
[0:51:36] <Buttku> cuz youre bad
[0:51:37] <+betrayed_llama> So you dont lose the motes LUL
[0:51:38] <%aishman> Cause that's better than straight up losing them
[0:51:38] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Cuz if you dont, you'll lose it entirely
[0:51:38] <%PinkSuprende> Pat DYING is in neficient
[0:51:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> less inefficient than dying @AngriestPat
[0:51:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> Because then you lose them
[0:51:40] <NiktenKing> cause 7 is better than none
[0:51:40] <+neojadan> Haha, one of the other team left
[0:51:41] <StarvingPenguinGod> LUL
[0:51:42] <Buttku> not worth the risk
[0:51:42] <KleptoBismol45> it could be worse, you could have had Fallen to deal with
[0:51:42] <%Ninestempest> Because getting motes in befor eyou get WIPED BY AN INVADER OR DIE is more important
[0:51:43] <%croxeye> it's more inefficient if you die
[0:51:43] <%demegodz> Better than zero, year
[0:51:44] <Tucker0603> not if you keep dieing
[0:51:44] <Deadbulky> LUL
[0:51:44] <LorcaNomad> IT'S NOT INDEX SUMMY
[0:51:45] <+Javaa01> Because you're wasting them completely right now
[0:51:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> better than losing those motes, fool
[0:51:47] <%totesmcgoat_> Because you've lost 30+ trying to be "efficient"
[0:51:48] <Punisher7771> for fuck sake
[0:51:48] <TheHeroAppears> losing all of them is more less efficient
[0:51:49] <%President_Miyazaki> In fact you lost them all twice in a row.
[0:51:51] <+jordanstayshome> if it's the difference between invading and not invading, bank
[0:51:51] <%Segartner> it's so you don't lose em
[0:51:52] <%iwishthiswasicq> It's also inefficient to bank none because you died.
[0:51:53] <Sullry> That‚Äôs why
[0:51:53] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Only time you shouldn't bank at a multiple of 5 is if you are invaded and have a chance to
[0:51:54] <%ssjklyco> OCD is inefficient
[0:51:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat, did you watch the datto video?
[0:51:55] <%croxeye> or
[0:51:57] <SpaceCatStation> better to bank weird numbers then to die and bank nothing
[0:51:57] <Wablafarga> every little bit helps
[0:51:57] <+cylish> blockers are nice but summoning the big guy is more important
[0:51:57] <%demegodz> Ye
[0:51:58] <%dekkitout> Not necessarily, banked motes are banked motes, blockers or none
[0:51:59] <%aishman> It's better to bank at 5 then lose 8
[0:51:59] <%croxeye> just get 5 then bank
[0:51:59] <nademonkey1100> 36 total lost
[0:52:00] <TheHeroAppears> sure pat
[0:52:00] <startstoprepeat> good advice
[0:52:01] <%Starlight_Gamer> i dont think so, always be banking
[0:52:03] <Quigsies> YOU‚Äôve lost like 30+
[0:52:04] <%demegodz> The more you dead, the less you die
[0:52:04] <FennecZephyr> Just bank every 5
[0:52:04] <+king_of_beggars> I mean if you were good, sure.
[0:52:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat I think its like 14. Being dead is the ultimate inefficiency
[0:52:08] <%Kashi_Nin> LUCKILY someone already left on the opposing team. or they just got screwed and stuck on 3
[0:52:12] <%President_Miyazaki> But the longer you hold them the greater the enemies chances of invading and killing you.
[0:52:13] <+neojadan> @AngriestPat Focus on 10, the captain you summon is the most annoying blocker to deal with
[0:52:15] <%Ninestempest> Invaders are incredibly strong, you can't realy on that mentality. Depositing is more important than getting a better blocker.
[0:52:17] <ElBuraindo> BANK
[0:52:18] <%Kenori> Sometimes its best to deposit what you have, getting too greedy can cost you a match
[0:52:18] <%croxeye> BANK AT
[0:52:24] <ElBuraindo> PAT YOU HEARD
[0:52:25] <Nazgul240> BANK
[0:52:26] <%President_Miyazaki> Also listen to what the Drifter says.
[0:52:27] <NiktenKing> that other team sucks
[0:52:29] <%Ninestempest> DEPOSIT RIGHT NOW
[0:52:31] <DarthBane98> Where's the other team?
[0:52:31] <Deadbulky> ...
[0:52:32] <Punisher7771> wait ha pat played gambit prime?
[0:52:33] <%totesmcgoat_> yes
[0:52:33] <ElBuraindo> FILL THE BANK
[0:52:33] <+jordanstayshome> yes
[0:52:34] <%Ninestempest> GET PRIMEVAL
[0:52:35] <Tucker0603> BANK IT
[0:52:35] <%demegodz> MIDDLE
[0:52:36] <+Nomicro4u> FILL IT TO THE BRIM
[0:52:38] <+Javaa01> Do what the nice man tells you and you won't lose
[0:52:38] <cisealnine> Pat, I would help you if I could. Your raid tweet kinda made me want to gather my old team to help you... Too bad we aren't on PC.
[0:52:38] <%President_Miyazaki> Pat. Please.
[0:52:39] <+jordanstayshome> the big tower
[0:52:40] <+king_of_beggars> Even the NPC is telling him to do it.
[0:52:41] <%ssjklyco> They are banking on you
[0:52:42] <%Diabetic> Does the console version on One X and PS4 Pro run at 30 FPS?
[0:52:43] <ElBuraindo> you did your part
[0:52:45] <DarthBane98> Where are they?
[0:52:45] <startstoprepeat> i'd also say that medium blockers are way more dangerous than large blockers so i always bank at 10-14
[0:52:46] <%totesmcgoat_> Drifter tells you what to do and when to do it
[0:52:48] <%dekkitout> Wow that gap, get ready to drink for every invasion yall
[0:52:51] <%Starlight_Gamer> always be banking
[0:52:52] <+betrayed_llama> Jump into the portal Pat!
[0:52:54] <%Kenori> Trust me, I play gambit constantly with people who think that 15 is the way to go, when even justna few 5s are goddamn annoying
[0:53:05] <%Ninestempest> wait does pat have a thunderlord is that what that is
[0:53:11] <Nazgul240> YOU JUST SAT THERE
[0:53:12] <%President_Miyazaki> Portal is how you invade.
[0:53:13] <+redribbonvinny> no meatball
[0:53:16] <%croxeye> nah pat don't bother with the portal
[0:53:16] <Tucker0603> portal is to invade
[0:53:16] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat the gray part of the meter at the top represents how much the bar will fill with the motes everyone on your team is carrying
[0:53:23] <nademonkey1100> yea i like to spam 5s
[0:53:23] <+neojadan> If you use your pulse to break teh shield on the envoys you'll do more damage + void explosion
[0:53:23] <%demegodz> I think everyone on the other team is AFKing now
[0:53:27] <LorcaNomad> so if my computer can kinda run warframe at okay graphical settings is that cool for destiny 2?
[0:53:28] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat machine guns are really good for invading
[0:53:33] <coldsama> @kenori The heroes are the people that just spam 5's to give you these precious seconds and quick invade
[0:53:35] <Punisher7771> the portal lets you invade
[0:53:38] <ElBuraindo> nice
[0:53:38] <%President_Miyazaki> As you were also being shot, and killed, which heals the boss.
[0:53:39] <%Starlight_Gamer> is no one invading?
[0:53:39] <%enickma11> I mean considering this score gap? It reeeeally doesn't matter
[0:53:42] <+Bob_Tom> you can shoot AND move
[0:53:43] <%Ninestempest> you sat in the middle of the room shooting it so they could just gib you lol
[0:53:46] <+informedotaku> wouldn't revive when invader present, more likely they are killed along with you
[0:53:46] <ElBuraindo> one more
[0:53:49] <%croxeye> at least pat kills the envoys which most new players don't
[0:53:54] <%dekkitout> With that score, I wouldn't invade either
[0:54:00] <%Kenori> @coldsama DAMN right
[0:54:04] <cisealnine> You shot it, but you weren't moving. In this mode your buns need to be mobile at all times.
[0:54:12] <+Pyroclase> whyd did he get taht triumph
[0:54:13] <%Kenori> I wonder if I should write a gambit guide
[0:54:14] <+betrayed_llama> Are the other team even trying? lul
[0:54:17] <%totesmcgoat_> Why did he get the triumph lol
[0:54:17] <%dekkitout> Wait- why'd you get the medal
[0:54:19] <SpaceCatStation> gambit has stuff
[0:54:25] <%Ninestempest> Gambit has a lot of stuff
[0:54:27] <PrimeNeverproc> use ELMO powers. it stuns all
[0:54:27] <+redribbonvinny> so is thunderlord more prevalent than hammerhead on pc?
[0:54:30] <%President_Miyazaki> I feel like the other team must just be farming invasion kills for a quest or something.
[0:54:33] <Personified134> kamehameha
[0:54:34] <%Ninestempest> no well?
[0:54:37] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Every 25 motes deposited, the invasion portal opens. So at the start of a match you want to get those first 25 as quickly as possible even if you have to deposit an odd amount.
[0:54:38] <coldsama> The enemy team is a joke and so are your mates Pat
[0:54:57] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat hit me up on Twitter if you want me to answer any question on game mechanics, I'm happy to help
[0:54:57] <%sjay449> catch up mechanics
[0:55:00] <Punisher7771> your portal is open
[0:55:00] <%Starlight_Gamer> id say invade to just be a distraction to other team
[0:55:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Everyone's bad, don't worry about it
[0:55:01] <%Ninestempest> Enemy team can invade every 40 seconds during primeval
[0:55:02] <%totesmcgoat_> I wasn't try to backseat, but 5/10/15 blockers are nice but getting your Primeval is the main goal
[0:55:03] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Do not blame Pat, for he knows not what he does BlessRNG
[0:55:08] <+Pyroclase> 30 seconds
[0:55:11] <Punisher7771> yes
[0:55:14] <DarthBane98> 30 secs
[0:55:15] <%demegodz> Yes
[0:55:20] <%jessedouglas> wtf when did pat start streaming I didn't get a notification
[0:55:22] <%Ninestempest> you did ittttttt
[0:55:24] <+HypotheticalWalrus> PogChamp
[0:55:25] <%demegodz> You won it!
[0:55:26] <%Ninestempest> you... did it.
[0:55:27] <%dekkitout> 30, unless someone is spawn trapping invades
[0:55:28] <TheHeroAppears> now you have done it
[0:55:28] <%GarbageNirvana> pogs
[0:55:29] <%Kashi_Nin> diiiiiiid iiiiiiiit
[0:55:31] <%totesmcgoat_> Good job man
[0:55:32] <%Gray_skies1993> TWO IN A ROW!!! apatDab puccaWin
[0:55:33] <%enickma11> Carry Lord Patrick Boivin
[0:55:33] <+Pendlez> oh density time?
[0:55:36] <%Kashi_Nin> pogs indeed
[0:55:39] <Ion_Laser> @jessedouglas 4 pm est
[0:55:43] <%totesmcgoat_> Gambit boots
[0:55:51] <+bonzosan> des2ny baybe!
[0:55:53] <%demegodz> Yeaaaaah
[0:55:54] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat every 1/3rd bar progress an invasion portal opens
[0:55:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> No pat. Unless you only have like, 3 motes or something, you ALWAYS bank between sides. Cause what happens when you kill all the enemies, and your full on motes? Those motes just lie there, wasted.
[0:55:58] <NiktenKing> Gamboots
[0:56:01] <cisealnine> Good job kiddo.
[0:56:04] <%sjay449> I got super annoyed at gambit, but Drifter is so cool
[0:56:05] <+informedotaku> no solstice armor?
[0:56:12] <%dekkitout> They're fixing it
[0:56:14] <+TheSaintJohn> that looks like a mess
[0:56:15] <%Ninestempest> Pursuits FUCKING SUCK
[0:56:16] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Gambit has a surprisingly high skillgap, Gambit prime even more so.
[0:56:16] <+Sibroma> They're fixing it
[0:56:17] <+Ryan1016> They're changing it soon
[0:56:17] <%totesmcgoat_> It is
[0:56:18] <+neojadan> They're fixing the UI for Shadowkeep
[0:56:20] <TheHeroAppears> bank motes in gabit LUL
[0:56:20] <Tucker0603> go to the drifter and get his bounties
[0:56:21] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, pursuits tab is bad.
[0:56:21] <+jordanstayshome> see drifter for the bounties
[0:56:21] <Personified134> this menu looks painful to navigate with a controller
[0:56:22] <%Ninestempest> They're fixing it in shadowkeep lmao
[0:56:22] <%demegodz> Green
[0:56:26] <%President_Miyazaki> It was better before.
[0:56:27] <Frostydough> Ahh i see Wollie will be joining us later and you guys will squad up for the podcast, absolutley genius
[0:56:31] <%dekkitout> You can filter by bounty/quest
[0:56:32] <SpaceCatStation> so glad they're fixing this nonsense
[0:56:34] <NiktenKing> Green
[0:56:34] <%totesmcgoat_> It was a great step in the right direction but they were just off the mark
[0:56:35] <+informedotaku> bounties and quest steps being separated in expansion
[0:56:37] <%Kenori> Its slow but not too hard
[0:56:38] <NegaScottsuper> is that ps4?
[0:56:40] <%Iccirrus> Those take awhile Pat
[0:56:40] <+neojadan> Work on Breakneck, it's SO GOOD
[0:56:47] <%totesmcgoat_> Top right is a bounty/quest sorter
[0:56:47] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Breakneck is great
[0:56:48] <Ion_Laser> @negascottsuper pc
[0:56:48] <nademonkey1100> he is on PC with a controller
[0:56:49] <%Iccirrus> Breakneck is pretty awesome though
[0:56:50] <+informedotaku> track the big ones
[0:56:59] <%Kashi_Nin> The Breakneck is suuuuper good so that gambit bounty might be something you wanna do
[0:57:05] <+angel949> gambit stuff will be green or have the logo on it
[0:57:06] <DirgeNovak> Hey @angriestpat was that you at Place Dupuis earlier? I was too shy to say hello
[0:57:06] <+informedotaku> love breakneck
[0:57:07] <startstoprepeat> ehh, breakneck ain't great on controller
[0:57:09] <%Segartner> Pat! have you worked on your awoken talisman?
[0:57:09] <NegaScottsuper> breakneck is the easiest
[0:57:12] <carzeri> has pat seen the shadowkeep trailer? there will be finishing moves or something like that
[0:57:13] <+Pyroclase> if you have SUROS regime, that's awesome for grinding breakneck
[0:57:19] <+betrayed_llama> You need 40 gambit matches for breackneck
[0:57:20] <Punisher7771> break neck it a good auto rifle
[0:57:21] <Tucker0603> breakneck is great
[0:57:23] <%Iccirrus> don't worry about hush
[0:57:23] <Sullry> Suros
[0:57:24] <%Iccirrus> it sucks
[0:57:25] <%President_Miyazaki> Okay Pat, before you go back into gambit ask any question you have about it.
[0:57:25] <%dekkitout> They're meant to be done over a 'season'
[0:57:26] <startstoprepeat> hush sucks, do not
[0:57:26] <OthoZen> hush is not worth is
[0:57:31] <DFireCreations> hush is alright but the quest is hell
[0:57:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> you don't NEED a "good" AR, just be the scrub you know you are @AngriestPat
[0:57:33] <$valriot> @angriestpat Did you unlock Black Armoury, and Menagerie?
[0:57:34] <%totesmcgoat_> Don't worry about the Hush bow
[0:57:37] <%Kashi_Nin> is Hush good? I honestly didn't bother...
[0:57:39] <SpaceCatStation> the Breakneck quest sucks but the gun is good
[0:57:41] <%totesmcgoat_> It's pretty lackluster
[0:57:41] <startstoprepeat> hush is great on m&kb, controller it's the worst weapon ever made
[0:57:43] <+neojadan> Hush is super fun to use
[0:57:43] <%dekkitout> Ghost Primus
[0:57:44] <%Iccirrus> hush is bad
[0:57:46] <sup3lolzx> @Kashi_Nin not rlly
[0:57:52] <Punisher7771> better than nuthing
[0:57:53] <NiktenKing> valkadyn
[0:57:58] <Sullry> They‚Äôre still not bad
[0:57:59] <%Iccirrus> it is
[0:58:03] <%President_Miyazaki> Sturm is GREAT
[0:58:07] <%Lt_Daitai_no_Shinto> Is this warframe?
[0:58:07] <OthoZen> origin story and ghost primus are good
[0:58:08] <%demegodz> Sweet Business is good too
[0:58:09] <%Kashi_Nin> that's kinda what I hear... that it is ok.
[0:58:12] <+redribbonvinny> for the multi kills I used the sweet business exotic
[0:58:12] <+angel949> pat just use your y1 stuff until you get good y2 stuff
[0:58:13] <Tucker0603> yes STURM IS AWESOME
[0:58:14] <%President_Miyazaki> Use it with Drang, the Legendary Energy Sidearm
[0:58:16] <+informedotaku> start visiting Xur on weekends to fix that
[0:58:16] <%dekkitout> Sweet Business if you're feeling adventurous
[0:58:17] <+jordanstayshome> use that go get ace
[0:58:18] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Focus on the Loaded question bounty, its one of the best PvE guns for ad clear and is easy to get.
[0:58:18] <%Iccirrus> you don't HAVE to
[0:58:21] <Punisher7771> yed
[0:58:21] <%Iccirrus> but you can
[0:58:22] <+Pyroclase> ytou don't NEED to, it just helps
[0:58:24] <%totesmcgoat_> Use in conjunction with Drang, legendary sidearm
[0:58:28] <+neojadan> Sturm is only good with Drang, but now oyu can stack up to 99 empowered rounds
[0:58:29] <%totesmcgoat_> to get most out of it
[0:58:31] <%Kashi_Nin> but not better than ok. fun but not particularly useful situationally
[0:58:32] <%Segartner> Drang is legendary
[0:58:34] <NiktenKing> not necessarily
[0:58:34] <%demegodz> You don't NEED to
[0:58:35] <+informedotaku> Xur can get you guaranteed new exotics you don't own per week
[0:58:38] <%Lt_Daitai_no_Shinto> Pat could you shit on WoW some more.
[0:58:39] <+neojadan> Yes
[0:58:41] <%President_Miyazaki> You never reload with Sturm and Drang and Sturm will 2 tap people in normal crucible.
[0:58:43] <OthoZen> no there is a new drang
[0:58:44] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Hard Light is an Auto Rifle 4Head
[0:58:45] <%lord_hades> lord_hades subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 10 months I missed the baby
[0:58:46] <%1Rayson> Sturm is a reference to a German literary period
[0:58:48] <%Iccirrus> there's a new one from the menagerie, but you probably couldn't get that atm
[0:58:48] <%demegodz> Not necessary no
[0:58:48] <Sullry> Yeah there‚Äôs another modern drang in the menagerie
[0:58:50] <%President_Miyazaki> Side Arm
[0:58:51] <%Nobrev> sidearm
[0:58:51] <%demegodz> Sidearm
[0:58:51] <+neojadan> Sideame
[0:58:53] <%dekkitout> There's a new Drang, but the old one's fine
[0:58:55] <Punisher7771> ther was no new drang
[0:58:56] <NegaScottsuper> SIDEARM
[0:58:57] <carzeri> it was right there, i saw it and now im triggered
[0:58:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> That's mida
[0:58:58] <$valriot> There's a new Drang in the Menagerie
[0:58:59] <DarthBane98> Sidearm
[0:59:00] <+betrayed_llama> What exotics is Xur selling now?
[0:59:03] <Sullry> New drang in menagerie
[0:59:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Exotics have fixed rolls anyway
[0:59:05] <+Pyroclase> Sturm and Drand means Storm and Stress and it's a german literature reference
[0:59:06] <Tucker0603> you can use the new drang but you need to do Menagerie to get the new one
[0:59:07] <NiktenKing> no... but you dont get catalyst progress with the new one
[0:59:07] <+jordanstayshome> correct
[0:59:09] <%President_Miyazaki> Sidearms are NOT terrible
[0:59:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> Sidearms are great
[0:59:13] <+bonzosan> drang is optional, but recommended for maximum damage output
[0:59:13] <Tucker0603> stand is solid
[0:59:14] <NegaScottsuper> NEW ONE
[0:59:14] <startstoprepeat> if you keep playing gambit you'll probably get the malfeasance quest pretty soon which i think you'll like
[0:59:17] <+neojadan> Baroque is the new version
[0:59:19] <OthoZen> HOW
[0:59:19] <%demegodz> OH
[0:59:19] <coldsama> There is a really good Drang you can have in the Menagerie
[0:59:24] <%sjay449> DANG
[0:59:25] <%demegodz> WHAT
[0:59:27] <%President_Miyazaki> They melt shotgun apes.
[0:59:27] <+Ryan1016> So you dont have sturm either
[0:59:27] <sup3lolzx> @President_Miyazaki they kinda are
[0:59:29] <Tucker0603> HOW?!?
[0:59:31] <%sjay449> he never got DRANG
[0:59:31] <+betrayed_llama> How?

[0:59:34] <cisealnine> How?
[0:59:35] <%Iccirrus> yeah,there's some fucky shit with that
[0:59:35] <Sullry> WHAT
[0:59:36] <+Sibroma> Impossible?!
[0:59:38] <%dekkitout> Check your other characters
[0:59:39] <FennecZephyr> Did you get the new drang?
[0:59:40] <+redribbonvinny> umm
[0:59:43] <%Kashi_Nin> huh...
[0:59:43] <Punisher7771> how the hell do you hanve the exotic?
[0:59:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> Failsafe will sell you one
[0:59:46] <LorcaNomad> is that like the best SMG in the game rn
[0:59:47] <+neojadan> Talk to Failsafe?
[0:59:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> other characters?
[0:59:48] <+Pyroclase> you don't have it because you disassembled it before collections became a thing
[0:59:48] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat did you delete drang before Forsaken?!?
[0:59:50] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:50] <NiktenKing> go to Tyra karn or Nessus
[0:59:52] <%Kashi_Nin> yeah how what now?
[0:59:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Buh
[0:59:52] <%Iccirrus> he deleted it before they did the collection backup WAY back when
[0:59:53] <+betrayed_llama> How did you get Sturn without drang?!?
[0:59:59] <%Starlight_Gamer> can you get a drang from a planet vendor?
[0:59:59] <%President_Miyazaki> Is it in the vault?
[1:00:00] <%Iccirrus> so it isn't in his collection
[1:00:02] <NegaScottsuper> check your other characters for the quest
[1:00:10] <%Iccirrus> Happened to me as well
[1:00:12] <sup3lolzx> @betrayed_llama he did the quest on another character if thats the case
[1:00:20] <NegaScottsuper> the drang comes from the farm
[1:00:22] <%Iccirrus> basically have to get back to that step on another character
[1:00:24] <+neojadan> If it's not in his collections he doesn't have it at all
[1:00:26] <%XxPatchworkxX> XxPatchworkxX subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:00:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat do the quest on another character?
[1:00:29] <%President_Miyazaki> Even without Drang Sturm is still a beast of a handcannon
[1:00:30] <%Iccirrus> yeah
[1:00:33] <MasterDecoder> Yep
[1:00:34] <+Ryan1016> They did check I think
[1:00:34] <%XxPatchworkxX> Is Drang just the 007 Golden gun?
[1:00:34] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Yep
[1:00:34] <+Pyroclase> They only scanned back to a certain date before Forsaken launched.
[1:00:34] <NegaScottsuper> no
[1:00:35] <%Ninestempest> at the change yeah
[1:00:36] <+redribbonvinny> yup
[1:00:37] <+Sibroma> And in the vault
[1:00:37] <%Iccirrus> because they didn't have a way to track that previously
[1:00:39] <%Ninestempest> well about a month before
[1:00:40] <%totesmcgoat_> No
[1:00:41] <NiktenKing> I'm pretty sure it's at Tyra
[1:00:42] <sup3lolzx> only quest wepons are like that
[1:00:42] <captainspauldin> nah
[1:00:44] <%Iccirrus> that's what collections were for
[1:00:45] <%Kashi_Nin> + vault
[1:00:47] <+bonzosan> no
[1:00:49] <%Kenori> Wow, I didnt know that. That's DUMB
[1:00:51] <%President_Miyazaki> Why didn't you put the unique weapon in the vault?
[1:00:52] <%Kashi_Nin> yeah
[1:00:53] <$afronooch> on your character around warmind yeah
[1:01:05] <%Iccirrus> yeah, it was early-mid warmind iirc that they did it
[1:01:11] <%riantDeliration> i felt smart for keeping a copy of everything in my vault lol
[1:01:15] <+Ryan1016> Cayde :(
[1:01:16] <%cureneckbeard> Never get rid of anything! You might need it later!
[1:01:19] <%Iccirrus> go talk to tyra at the farm
[1:01:20] <%XxPatchworkxX> is this game good now? thinking about getting it on PC
[1:01:21] <%GarbageNirvana> ABANDONED QUEST
[1:01:22] <+informedotaku> did you make progress on a character that isn't your warlock?
[1:01:22] <%Iccirrus> she MIGHT have it for you
[1:01:26] <%demegodz> WACK
[1:01:28] <%Gray_skies1993> RIP Cayde *salute*
[1:01:29] <+betrayed_llama> Check the Farm
[1:01:31] <%totesmcgoat_> Turn in tokens, they're useless
[1:01:31] <+Pyroclase> Go to Tyra Karn at the farm then
[1:01:31] <NiktenKing> Tyra at the farm
[1:01:32] <%dekkitout> Try 'The Farm' socil space
[1:01:34] <MasterDecoder> Yea, it's the Abandoned Quest
[1:01:34] <+neojadan> You can get the new one from Menagerie
[1:01:36] <Sullry> Do that quest maybe?
[1:01:37] <%Ascethetic> should i reinstall this on my ps4?
[1:01:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @XxPatchworkxX wait for Steam in Oct
[1:01:41] <JamboLovePanda> if it wasn't on your character or in your vault then it wouldn't have registered when they did the check
[1:01:41] <sup3lolzx> you can get the drang from collections on your other character
[1:01:43] <%Kashi_Nin> You should be able to get it from the farm yeah
[1:01:48] <%Ascethetic> or should i get pc version
[1:01:49] <+alpacasintophats> What‚Äôs he playing this on?
[1:01:53] <%demegodz> PC
[1:01:54] <%XxPatchworkxX> @legendfather_of_giants thanks dude
[1:01:54] <%Ninestempest> what do you think
[1:01:55] <%Ninestempest> it's PAT
[1:02:03] <+alpacasintophats> Fair enough
[1:02:04] <+Zxtole> Is there a worse character than Failsafe?
[1:02:08] <+alpacasintophats> Thanks thouh
[1:02:11] <coldsama> Can someone tell Failsafe to delete system 32
[1:02:12] <NiktenKing> It doesn't matter ifs the same roll
[1:02:17] <+neojadan> @Zxtole Failsafe is the best
[1:02:19] <+informedotaku> he had 3 balls
[1:02:25] <NiktenKing> @zxtole Osiris
[1:02:27] <Punisher7771> geese are assholes
[1:02:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @XxPatchworkxX unless you got it before the PC version came out. You might have it free on battlenet, like I did
[1:02:29] <NovraSplice> how is Paige doing?
[1:02:30] <TheHeroAppears> at least they didn't steal the kid
[1:02:30] <%NWR_James> kick all geese
[1:02:32] <+betrayed_llama> Pog
[1:02:37] <%JoeJotaro> JoeJotaro subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! i hope all is well Pat, love watching your survivor horror LPs. since the original RE2 LP.
[1:02:37] <%demegodz> NICE
[1:02:38] <%demegodz> Oh
[1:02:40] <shadowsofpain> can't you just print it out of the collection?
[1:02:42] <%demegodz> Gotta work on it
[1:02:43] <Tucker0603> need to earn it though
[1:02:56] <+Reveresao> whens he gonna raid??
[1:02:57] <%demegodz> Yes
[1:02:58] <+neojadan> Cryptarch
[1:02:59] <%Ranryu692> a mapmaker
[1:03:00] <MasterDecoder> Cryptarch Pat
[1:03:00] <+informedotaku> I love that the collection may as well be a 3D printer
[1:03:01] <Thalchampz> a dude that maps
[1:03:01] <%Iccirrus> @shadowsofpain no,because he didn't have it on hand when collections came about
[1:03:01] <carzeri> so many questions
[1:03:02] <KnightAsteran> you need Drang to do it tho
[1:03:03] <$afronooch> ye
[1:03:03] <+Pyroclase> Cryptarch
[1:03:05] <%XxPatchworkxX> @legendfather_of_giants I have it for the ps4. but I didn't bother to continue when the first expansion dropped
[1:03:05] <SoySocks> cartographers make maps
[1:03:07] <sup3lolzx> @shadowsofpain the drang can only be pulled from collections from the characther that unlocked it
[1:03:08] <%dekkitout> They're this game's item identifiers
[1:03:08] <+king_of_beggars> It's someone that makes maps.
[1:03:09] <%Yadogari> Wait was that just a Mauser
[1:03:10] <%Kenori> Right in front of you bud
[1:03:12] <NiktenKing> that's her
[1:03:13] <+Ryan1016> That was her
[1:03:15] <%Kenori> Literally staring at her a minute ago
[1:03:16] <+Sibroma> Cryptarchropher
[1:03:16] <%Kirby_Sauce> Parkour now
[1:03:16] <%Ninestempest> tehre was someone next to you Pat
[1:03:17] <Frostydough> @AngriestPat Did you fucking see gameplay footage of Death Stranding in the gamescon???? Like what the hell man
[1:03:18] <%Kenori> in the hut
[1:03:19] <+betrayed_llama> SourPls
[1:03:21] <Tucker0603> YALK TO HER
[1:03:21] <shadowsofpain> @sup3lolzx thanks dude
[1:03:24] <%Kenori> Hmmm
[1:03:24] <+Pyroclase> welp
[1:03:27] <%demegodz> Oh
[1:03:27] <Tucker0603> fuck
[1:03:28] <NiktenKing> well shit
[1:03:29] <+neojadan> ...huh
[1:03:29] <+informedotaku> why does he want this gun?
[1:03:29] <%demegodz> Hmmm
[1:03:29] <%Kenori> thats...odd
[1:03:30] <MasterDecoder> Gotta get a new one
[1:03:31] <%Kashi_Nin> well crap
[1:03:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @XxPatchworkxX Neither did I, but I think getting it early got me the PC version too, free
[1:03:37] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I want, so bad, to see Pat attempt things like the Whisper or Zero Hour quest on this stream someday.
[1:03:38] <NiktenKing> gotta get new one?
[1:03:38] <%demegodz> TIme for a new one
[1:03:41] <%Kenori> Does she have more than one page?
[1:03:41] <+redribbonvinny> this is awkward
[1:03:43] <carzeri> i love the music in destiny 2
[1:03:43] <+smaccc> NotLikeThis
[1:03:46] <+betrayed_llama> RIP Drang
[1:03:46] <NiktenKing> she normally sells it
[1:03:47] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat gonna have to do the quest for drang again
[1:03:47] <+Sibroma> Did you do the quest on this character or a different one?
[1:03:47] <%Kenori> Check and see if she has more than one page
[1:03:49] <+neojadan> well this sucks, because you can't progress the catalyst with the new Drang
[1:03:51] <%Ascethetic> @legendfather_of_giants howd you get it free
[1:03:51] <+Pyroclase> guess we're teaching pat how to run menageria
[1:03:54] <%Kenori> Yep
[1:03:54] <+serranobros> that glow effect looks really bad
[1:03:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> Order_of_Mystery subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Dammit Pat, you're making me want to play D2 again! Is it worth playing solo, or should i try and buddy up?
[1:04:00] <sup3lolzx> @AngriestPat if u want drang, go to the character that you did the quest with and pull it from collections
[1:04:01] <coldsama> Maybe there is no way to get it back because Drang Baroque is just better?
[1:04:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I thought the Farm was rad too, yeah
[1:04:07] <MasterDecoder> She does
[1:04:08] <+AngrySpaceLlama51> It may be at devrim at the edz
[1:04:08] <Tucker0603> yeah the farm is awesome
[1:04:09] <KnightAsteran> Cryptographer pat, Tyra Karn
[1:04:10] <NiktenKing> you can always do another quest for it on another character
[1:04:10] <MasterDecoder> *Doesn't
[1:04:12] <%Kenori> She does not
[1:04:14] <%Kenori> Goddamnit
[1:04:16] <+Ryan1016> Big fat nothing
[1:04:17] <%Kashi_Nin> nope
[1:04:20] <+Pigg1yJuffs> What is Pat trying to do here?
[1:04:21] <%Kenori> Thats dumb
[1:04:23] <%arcaderabbit48> The world cannot handle more than one Paige
[1:04:24] <NiktenKing> but meh
[1:04:25] <+siggystardust> Pat did you do it on another character?
[1:04:30] <+neojadan> She sells it if you already have it
[1:04:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ascethetic might be because I preordered deluxe edition, but I bought it on PS4 day 1 and got it on PC for free
[1:04:33] <+Sibroma> You might have done the quest on a different character?
[1:04:34] <+informedotaku> on another character
[1:04:35] <$afronooch> did he check failsafe?
[1:04:37] <Sullry> Check the Edz guy
[1:04:38] <+Pyroclase> talk to her on your other characters
[1:04:39] <%Kenori> Are you SURE you did it?
[1:04:40] <OthoZen> she does after doing the quest
[1:04:42] <%demegodz> Hmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:04:44] <NegaScottsuper> she sells it upon completion
[1:04:46] <NiktenKing> yeah
[1:04:47] <%Kenori> EDZ guy sells Mini Tool
[1:04:50] <shadowsofpain> she used to, I guess she doesn't anymore?
[1:04:52] <+betrayed_llama> @AngriestPat Just get the new one from the menagerie
[1:04:53] <SpaceCatStation> @afronooch yeah nothing
[1:04:53] <Quigsies> Did you DO the quest?
[1:04:59] <MasterDecoder> SHE SELLS IT IF YOU GOT IT PER CHARACTER
[1:05:01] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat think the game bugged out since it said you abandoned the quest
[1:05:03] <+Pyroclase> .... wqhy was change character in his settings menu what the fuck
[1:05:08] <+Nomicro4u> where Elmo?
[1:05:14] <%Ascethetic> @legendfather_of_giants i bought it ps4 day 1, i wonder if i can get it free for pc still
[1:05:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> Gave you a tip in the discord's shooty bang
[1:05:19] <sup3lolzx> check collecitons
[1:05:23] <NiktenKing> he needs completion, he had O Captain on Nessus
[1:05:23] <+informedotaku> he's playing on PC
[1:05:23] <Punisher7771> wait the managerie drops drang?
[1:05:25] <%Kenori> Dont' worry, thats a thing they are changing with Shadowkeep
[1:05:26] <%demegodz> Yeah thats shit
[1:05:29] <NegaScottsuper> no one doesn't work with the catalyst
[1:05:34] <MasterDecoder> We all hate that @AngriestPat
[1:05:34] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Anyone want to explain what Pat is trying to do here? I'm lost on why Pat is lost.
[1:05:36] <+Reveresao> did he get whisper
[1:05:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ascethetic you might have to link battlenet and ps+ account or something
[1:05:39] <+Pyroclase> earth is in the middle pat
[1:05:39] <%dekkitout> Yeah, exotic quests need to be account wide
[1:05:41] <%demegodz> As someone who loves this shit, that is super shit
[1:05:42] <+QuasartheHero> ok is stream labs busted for anyone else?
[1:05:42] <+informedotaku> check inventory
[1:05:47] <%Kenori> They are splitting up Pursuits and Bounties
[1:05:49] <%Segartner> They are fixing that on shadowkeep
[1:05:49] <NegaScottsuper> Pat is always lost
[1:05:56] <+informedotaku> whisper tough
[1:05:58] <NiktenKing> whi
[1:06:02] <+king_of_beggars> I hate that thing that just happened to you, specifically. If an NPC has nothing for you to look at it shouldn't even let you into a menu.
[1:06:02] <sup3lolzx> collections
[1:06:03] <+informedotaku> aw sorry
[1:06:06] <NiktenKing> which platform puzzle?
[1:06:07] <+king_of_beggars> It's such bad direction.
[1:06:10] <+betrayed_llama> Inventory should be universal so that wont work
[1:06:11] <%Kashi_Nin> Did you do the green room shortcut in thw Whisper?
[1:06:14] <%dekkitout> Whisper is a shadow of itself now
[1:06:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> is Sweet Business still good?
[1:06:22] <$afronooch> nah
[1:06:23] <%XxPatchworkxX> what's the benefit of getting a copy of destiny 2 now on pc?
[1:06:24] <sup3lolzx> @betrayed_llama not for drang for some reason
[1:06:28] <%pilgrimsayswhat> L O L
[1:06:29] <%Kenori> There it is
[1:06:29] <sup3lolzx> YEET
[1:06:30] <%Zamorouskiwhich> LUL
[1:06:30] <+Reveresao> still looks cool tho
[1:06:31] <%demegodz> POG

[1:06:36] <%Ninestempest> ????????????
[1:06:37] <DFireCreations> hUH
[1:06:37] <+jordanstayshome> yeah
[1:06:37] <+TheSaintJohn> lmao
[1:06:39] <sup3lolzx> only for the drang @AngriestPat
[1:06:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You should get some salt water taffy. Make your day a whole lot better.
[1:06:39] <SpaceCatStation> what the heck LUL
[1:06:40] <LorcaNomad> whadda fuc
[1:06:40] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat no, that's a glitch
[1:06:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Shouldn't be?
[1:06:41] <+Ryan1016> They shouldnt be LUL
[1:06:42] <NiktenKing> No
[1:06:43] <+Crimsonpajamas > it shouldn't be
[1:06:43] <Sullry> Wtf
[1:06:43] <Ion_Laser> ???
[1:06:44] <ozuma35> failsafe also sells it on nessus and no it isnt
[1:06:44] <%Kenori> Its not
[1:06:44] <%demegodz> Pat the fuck you do
[1:06:45] <%dekkitout> I guess, I never had this issue
[1:06:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> WHY WOULDNT THEY BE PATRICK
[1:06:46] <%Ninestempest> They shouldn't be what the fuck
[1:06:47] <%vaporousTippler> Your love is fading!
[1:06:47] <+Nomicro4u> LUL
[1:06:47] <+TheSaintJohn> BIG dumb
[1:06:49] <MasterDecoder> THEY SHOULDN'T BE
[1:06:49] <%Kenori> Or it shouldnt be
[1:06:49] <NiktenKing> probably had to log in
[1:06:50] <%Nobrev> they always have been
[1:06:51] <+Pyroclase> I have a thousand or so hours in destiny and have NEVER seen this
[1:06:51] <Punisher7771> thats fucking stupid
[1:06:52] <Tucker0603> ITS A GLITCH
[1:06:52] <shadowsofpain> they definitely shouldn't be?
[1:06:52] <%Kenori> Thye should NOT be
[1:06:53] <FennecZephyr> That shouldnt be that way
[1:06:53] <%NovaKnightmare> you FOOL
[1:06:54] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat You broke the game
[1:06:57] <NegaScottsuper> you didn't start the quest on your warlock
[1:06:57] <+Reveresao> no
[1:06:59] <%Kenori> THEY SHOULDNT BE
[1:07:00] <+Ryan1016> THEY'RE NOT FOR ME @AngriestPat what did you do
[1:07:00] <captainspauldin> drang,polaris as well
[1:07:01] <KaliasTV> @AngriestPat Drang is weird and only appears with the quest completion per character
[1:07:02] <%Kenori> THEY ARE NOT ON PS4
[1:07:03] <$CharlesRobinJr> welcome to destiny ,y guy
[1:07:03] <FennecZephyr> If it's only for drang, that's weird
[1:07:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> BUT SHUT UP
[1:07:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat probably only for quest weapons
[1:07:04] <%dekkitout> Only Drang? Not Mida-mini?
[1:07:06] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat I think that is 100% a bug with drang
[1:07:07] <+redribbonvinny> pull it and it should now unlock on all characters I believe
[1:07:07] <shinigami40297> Its a glitch with Drang and mida mini tool
[1:07:08] <+Nomicro4u> TIME TO DO IT ALL AGAIN
[1:07:09] <no_johns_justin> guess you found a glitch
[1:07:09] <Sullry> That doesn‚Äôt work like that
[1:07:10] <%Kenori> This is wrong and broken
[1:07:12] <sup3lolzx> this is a unique quest gun, thats why
[1:07:16] <shadowsofpain> oh yeah drang is weird
[1:07:16] <NiktenKing> you need quest completion for it on warlock that's why
[1:07:18] <JamboLovePanda> I guess because it's a quest reward it is? Still dumb though
[1:07:19] <%DukeAtomic> Collections aren't different on each character only for QUEST weapons @AngriestPat
[1:07:19] <Felipacus> Is Pat playing through battlenet?
[1:07:20] <+Pigg1yJuffs> @angriestpat You broke it. It shouldn't be like that.
[1:07:21] <Sullry> That‚Äôs gotta be a glitch
[1:07:23] <dukenux> But what do they do in Royalguard?
[1:07:27] <dero45> How much did they pay u to play this
[1:07:29] <nademonkey1100> its a quest weapon
[1:07:29] <Delenay> man, if i started this game up, i feel like id have to start new
[1:07:29] <%Kenori> I'm gonna go check my Titan on PS4
[1:07:30] <+betrayed_llama> Wait, put it in the vault
[1:07:35] <+AngrySpaceLlama51> It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a quest weapon
[1:07:35] <coldsama> I just tried, I finished the quest only with my Warlock and I can get it with two other characters, looks like a bug idk
[1:07:44] <gps309> Ubisoft took down the opening night archive from youtube because it had ubi content on it
[1:07:44] <+betrayed_llama> nvm
[1:07:45] <+informedotaku> that's like saying 3 friends are going to a concert and the ticket lady said they each had to print tickets on their own printer
[1:07:47] <$valriot> The menagerie version is better anyone and it's not difficult content, it's like ez mode matchmaking raids
[1:07:52] <%Order_of_Mystery> Drang and Sturm, fuck yeah
[1:07:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Is that just the gun from "The man with the Golden Gun"?
[1:08:05] <$CharlesRobinJr> have you found any shaders you like
[1:08:11] <KaliasTV> It's gambit for this stage isn't it
[1:08:12] <%Segartner> YEA
[1:08:12] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Ace of Spades is great
[1:08:12] <mrblack499> that gold side arm looked good
[1:08:12] <carzeri> is the ace of spades still super strong?
[1:08:13] <%Lt_Daitai_no_Shinto> oh snap
[1:08:16] <Punisher7771> its a lot of hand guns kills
[1:08:16] <suikudo> Really?!
[1:08:17] <%dekkitout> Did it say Crucible or Strike?
[1:08:17] <+gatoralus> the ace of spades is one of the best guns ever in a game ever
[1:08:18] <%Ninestempest> aw shit D2 crucible :O
[1:08:19] <%Kenori> I mean you're wrong
[1:08:19] <Sullry> No that‚Äôs not golden gun I think it‚Äôs last word
[1:08:24] <%Ninestempest> The trash fire live on stream
[1:08:24] <+d00msdaydan> Oh boy I tuned in just in time for crucible
[1:08:25] <$valriot> Crucible is fun just...KINDA FUCKED
[1:08:25] <%Kenori> Crucible is not as good as Gambit Prime
[1:08:28] <+Pyroclase> Just be glad that you don't have to do the original version of the quest, which required invader kills with a handcannon in Gambit.
[1:08:29] <SpaceCatStation> crucible is a mess but it can be fun
[1:08:30] <%Kenori> I think Crucible is bad
[1:08:32] <+informedotaku> pvp fun too, why I prefer it over Warframe
[1:08:32] <Punisher7771> wait pat why not try getting the last word
[1:08:33] <NiktenKing> Crucible is fun... sometimes
[1:08:35] <%Kenori> Because Shotguns are a cancer
[1:08:36] <KaliasTV> @AngriestPat isn't this stage gambit
[1:08:37] <carzeri> i love crucible
[1:08:38] <shadowsofpain> get a trust I'm sure you would love it
[1:08:40] <+Reveresao> no play rumble
[1:08:43] <+betrayed_llama> Crucible is fun if you dont care about winning
[1:08:44] <%riantDeliration> bad things can still be fun
[1:08:46] <ozuma35> wont be gettin no handcannon kills with sturm in crucible
[1:08:48] <%dekkitout> Mayhem and Rumble are the only fun ones
[1:08:52] <ozuma35> too slow
[1:08:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> LFG sites work too
[1:08:55] <dero45> This should be fun handgun vs all the op guns
[1:08:58] <$valriot> Once Heavy and Supers get nerfed, it'll be a lot better
[1:08:58] <NiktenKing> play with pals, use companion app/discord
[1:09:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Everything's more fun with friends though
[1:09:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Watching paint dry is more fun with friends
[1:09:05] <TheIndigoLlama> @Punisher7771 TLW is HELLA difficult to learn to use on controller
[1:09:09] <ozuma35> with drang yes
[1:09:10] <$CharlesRobinJr> ace is way better
[1:09:14] <$afronooch> in pve yeah
[1:09:16] <+informedotaku> it takes time to get used to sidearms
[1:09:17] <%Kenori> Last Word GANG
[1:09:18] <+Ryan1016> Sturm is fine
[1:09:18] <shinigami40297> sturm is 110 rpm 110's are garbo in pvp
[1:09:18] <no_johns_justin> in pve
[1:09:21] <suikudo> You are gonna get dropped by the ace of spades
[1:09:21] <NiktenKing> Storm is good... just idk about against mk players
[1:09:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh, hello Mauser broomhandle
[1:09:25] <%Kenori> LAST WORD GANG
[1:09:27] <ozuma35> you get kills with drang and it powers up sturm
[1:09:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> you combo it with Drang for good times
[1:09:31] <%demegodz> maaaan
[1:09:32] <KaliasTV> Sturm gets a big upgrade with the catalyst
[1:09:36] <$valriot> GANG GANG LAST WORD
[1:09:37] <Tucker0603> it is in PVE and PvP it's based on your skill
[1:09:38] <ozuma35> can 1 tap in crucible
[1:09:39] <shadowsofpain> definitely get a 180 headcanon since you play with a controller, they dont have bloom
[1:09:40] <startstoprepeat> last word's great on controller, people just give up to easy
[1:09:46] <NiktenKing> kills with drang then overcharge sturm
[1:09:46] <%chiluzza> Why are you getting it now why didnt you have it already
[1:09:48] <+Ryan1016> Sturm works fine
[1:09:48] <%demegodz> pat you're doing great
[1:09:50] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Some weapons are better for PvE, some better for PvP, Sturm not great overall, at least, for me
[1:09:51] <+TaylOctopus91> if you have Crimson, use that to get Ace
[1:09:52] <suikudo> oh and dont even think about using a smg
[1:09:58] <ozuma35> do you have vanguard tokens?
[1:09:59] <%chiluzza> i dont care about your excuses you need to CONSUME THE PRODCUT TO STAY UP TO DATE
[1:10:01] <dero45> This was easy to get when everyone else was trying to get pistol kills
[1:10:02] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat timed payload is a beast
[1:10:03] <+Pyroclase> Bloom is accurcy decrease with every shot
[1:10:04] <+redribbonvinny> what was your question @angriestpat ?
[1:10:05] <%dekkitout> Weapon spread
[1:10:06] <MasterDecoder> Reticle open outward
[1:10:07] <suikudo> smgs suck shit in this game
[1:10:07] <Sullry> Just use better devils it‚Äôs not bad
[1:10:10] <+Ryan1016> Crimson fucking sucks what
[1:10:10] <+TheSaintJohn> crosshair expansion
[1:10:10] <%Kenori> Crimson good as well
[1:10:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> When the reticule expands
[1:10:11] <%Agami23> its a lighting engine thing
[1:10:11] <+Reveresao> crimson??
[1:10:11] <+Zinectrik> So pat how much of a shitshow was gamescom
[1:10:11] <+informedotaku> yup
[1:10:14] <shinigami40297> Crimson is even worse
[1:10:16] <NegaScottsuper> Stop trolling
[1:10:17] <+betrayed_llama> Its decent
[1:10:19] <$afronooch> no
[1:10:22] <Sullry> Bloom is reticle expanding after shots
[1:10:23] <%Segartner> CRIMSON IS AWFUL
[1:10:23] <Tucker0603> it's decent
[1:10:26] <shadowsofpain> bloom is a concept on controllers, they cause ghost bullets
[1:10:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> bloom refers to accuracy decreasing after you fire. notice how your reticle 'blooms' out after each shot?
[1:10:29] <NiktenKing> Crimson is jack of all trades
[1:10:29] <+xMongolian> Crimson is garbage lmfao
[1:10:30] <Sullry> Reach had it
[1:10:31] <ozuma35> use midnight coup
[1:10:32] <+Pyroclase> AFAIK it makes handcannons bab on console?
[1:10:32] <NegaScottsuper> Crimson is decent with Catalyst maybe?
[1:10:35] <%totesmcgoat_> Bloom is bullet drift. The bullet won't go in the exact middle of the crosshair
[1:10:36] <%ArcanumMBD> FPS players get salty over bloom because having a visual indication of wweapon spread is bad apparently?
[1:10:37] <ScarletPrime> Bloom is the auto-fire accuracy penalty from holding down the trigger.
[1:10:39] <Cactuskris> sturm and drang is a timeframe in german literature
[1:10:39] <$afronooch> crimson is a shitty pulse in pvp
[1:10:39] <+MisterCrimson> Fuck all y'all. I feel attacked
[1:10:39] <ozuma35> still viable in crucible
[1:10:41] <Incendio_M> These load times tho
[1:10:41] <shinigami40297> Crimson is a handcannon that shoots like a pulse rifle and its awful
[1:10:41] <+informedotaku> play style different
[1:10:43] <+TheSaintJohn> Crimson not as good as GRE
[1:10:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> cuz everyone stumbo
[1:10:45] <NegaScottsuper> Crimson is trash
[1:10:45] <+Sibroma> Let him try the guns he wants to lol
[1:10:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Because nobody actually knows how this game works
[1:10:49] <hippieofdeath> When are you doing FF7 again?
[1:10:51] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I love both crimson and sturm
[1:10:58] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Because people have opinions. Also infinite loading screen apatDab
[1:11:01] <%ArcanumMBD> No Pat just get gun
[1:11:04] <gps309> pat burned everything
[1:11:04] <%SlashHabit> oooh no
[1:11:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> WHY DON'T YOU KEEP GUNS PAT
[1:11:06] <%ArcanumMBD> JUST GET GUN
[1:11:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Ok.

[1:11:07] <$CharlesRobinJr> fuck now i wanna go back and see the shit that i had in D2
[1:11:08] <ozuma35> take it from your collection then dummy
[1:11:08] <+informedotaku> vault empty?
[1:11:10] <coldsama> Crimson lacks range and got a bit of spread, it's decent but not the best
[1:11:10] <+Nomicro4u> GUN GUN GUN GUN
[1:11:11] <+Ryan1016> Just get it 4Head
[1:11:12] <+angel949> try nature of the beast it's a year one that you can get from collections
[1:11:12] <%dekkitout> Sometimes your bullets don't hit where you aim- that's 'bloom'
[1:11:15] <derekwst3> what did you say? I wasn't listening
[1:11:18] <shadowsofpain> I'd say play gambit then
[1:11:18] <+goatseatingcoins> Just get it lul
[1:11:18] <+Pyroclase> Midnight Coup is a year one gun from the levi raid
[1:11:19] <$afronooch> run menagerie to get better guns
[1:11:20] <%SlashHabit> Your Vault needs to be full
[1:11:22] <shinigami40297> You could pull a year 1 better devils out of collections, its still okay
[1:11:23] <%chiluzza> obv you should of kept playing to get them
[1:11:26] <%SlashHabit> booo pat
[1:11:27] <sup3lolzx> check collections for a better devils

[1:11:48] <%dekkitout> "Just get Outbreak Prime" 4Head
[1:11:51] <%Spydurman> have you tried getting better guns?
[1:11:53] <Vivalabonte> Just dig up stupid.
[1:11:53] <Quigsies> But why don‚Äôt you have da gun tho
[1:11:54] <SpaceCatStation> but PAT why haven't you done all the content already??????????
[1:11:55] <%Order_of_Mystery> chat: Pat use da gun Pat: I no have that gun! chat: *pikachu face*
[1:11:55] <+Pyroclase> holy shit
[1:11:56] <shadowsofpain> the trust comes from gambit bounties and rank ups. it's one of the best 180 handcannons
[1:11:56] <Zebroneath> It's interesting how this only happens during Destiny streams.
[1:11:57] <+Pyroclase> that air shot
[1:12:00] <%frsttcs> frsttcs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Swapped your old space dolls for new space dolls
[1:12:00] <soullesskin> Lmao üòÇüòÇ
[1:12:00] <startstoprepeat> noice
[1:12:00] <NiktenKing> oh
[1:12:01] <FennecZephyr> He never did Levi. He doesnt have the gun
[1:12:01] <%Segartner> nice
[1:12:03] <%ssjklyco> Pat, why don't you have the item in a game I played for years that you rejoined aweek ago
[1:12:04] <dero45> Just get all the guns already noob
[1:12:05] <NiktenKing> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:12:10] <+Takuatt> Has Pat watched the Death Stranding gameplay?
[1:12:17] <+betrayed_llama> This isnt a good map for hand-cannons
[1:12:20] <Daxalog> Did they fix the PvP so you dont have to be max level to not be 1 shotted?
[1:12:20] <%Segartner> @AngriestPat You better land those shot Patrick!
[1:12:21] <+informedotaku> love the sounds of this game
[1:12:21] <Tucker0603> if Sturm doesn't work that ten paces might work out well since it has timed payload
[1:12:24] <+Pyroclase> This is UNKNOWN SPACE
[1:12:28] <MasterDecoder> ^
[1:12:28] <ozuma35> drang kills power up sturm
[1:12:32] <+Pyroclase> it's... a pocket dimension the Nine own??
[1:12:33] <NiktenKing> UNKNOWN.... SPACE
[1:12:33] <Quigsies> @takuatt nah, he‚Äôs watching it after this stream
[1:12:36] <%dekkitout> It's some arena midiclorians made
[1:12:37] <+Pyroclase> It's just there to look fancy tbh
[1:12:38] <Sullry> Weird nine place
[1:12:39] <%dekkitout> I shit you not
[1:12:43] <ElBuraindo> you don't reload that gun pat
[1:12:47] <ElBuraindo> you switch between them
[1:12:48] <+LooglePlatinum> hello everyone
[1:12:49] <%Kenori> You're within the Driftor's ship
[1:12:51] <%totesmcgoat_> Sturm can one shot given the right conditions
[1:12:55] <+Pyroclase> Also it turns ouit the Nine are just the 8 planets and the sun.
[1:12:58] <%Kenori> Which is a portal to the Nine????
[1:13:01] <coldsama> You should try and upgrade your Chalice of Opulence, you can get Austringer hand cannon really easily ans even with bad rolls it's awesome in Crucible
[1:13:07] <%Kenori> @Pyroclase Wait WHAT?!
[1:13:12] <$valriot> 2 tap time PogChamp
[1:13:14] <+LooglePlatinum> hi Pat you grind out solstice armor
[1:13:17] <+Takuatt> @Quigsies Ah cool, ty
[1:13:19] <%dekkitout> The Nine are midiclorians
[1:13:20] <dero45> Is it kills with hand cannons or head shots
[1:13:23] <+Pyroclase> @Kenori YUP
[1:13:27] <shinigami40297> The Nine are space dust that became sentient due to space magic, which is weird
[1:13:28] <%Segartner> Better land those shots man!
[1:13:34] <%totesmcgoat_> Some games just get one sided
[1:13:41] <%Segartner> Darn
[1:13:41] <%Kenori> @Pyroclase Do you mean like...Anthro personifications? Where did this get learned?!
[1:13:50] <Quigsies> @takuatt np ‚ù§Ô∏è
[1:13:52] <ozuma35> this is a long range map. pulse and scouts galore
[1:13:57] <%dekkitout> In a recent lore dump @Kenori
[1:13:58] <+gerenago> Is okay pat <3
[1:13:59] <ghostofsolomon> you're doing alright pat
[1:14:01] <+LooglePlatinum> neeto it in bucket list to do
[1:14:01] <%Segartner> 2/3 not bad
[1:14:04] <startstoprepeat> that guy had ace of spades, ask if you can borrow it
[1:14:06] <MasterDecoder> @Kenori LAst two entries in the Dust Lore book
[1:14:07] <%Kenori> That seems...I dunno...
[1:14:09] <+Pyroclase> @Kenori Specifically they are conciousnesses formed out of dark matter that are trapped in the gravity wells of the various planets. They have a vested interested in the surival of the solar system because they cannot exist without the life on the planets.
[1:14:09] <mrblack499> is crazy talk still a thing?
[1:14:10] <ghostofsolomon> NICE
[1:14:12] <ElBuraindo> stop reloading aaaaaa

[1:16:30] <dero45> Indeed
[1:16:31] <shinigami40297> Gambit kills, then 250 strike kills, then like 30 pvp kills
[1:16:31] <shadowsofpain> maybe you'll get a trust while playing gambit
[1:16:33] <%chiluzza> well it was a fast win at least
[1:16:34] <%President_Miyazaki> So what you do is you kill a bunch of mobs with the Drang, then invade and start two tapping bitches with the Sturm.
[1:16:35] <%chiluzza> you were last
[1:16:37] <+LooglePlatinum> case will like nah you get no precision head shots
[1:16:41] <Copperama> Do stats super matter in PVP? If so, can you ever win against an end game player?
[1:16:46] <Quigsies> At least you noticed now and not like, 2 hours from now
[1:16:48] <%Kenori> What room?
[1:16:49] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Oh the ball is super simple, its frustrating LUL
[1:16:49] <+Pyroclase> You needed to kill the ball, Pat
[1:16:52] <shadowsofpain> theirs a cheese for that room
[1:16:54] <+LooglePlatinum> oh whisper oh~~
[1:16:54] <nademonkey1100> do you want someone to guide you through that pat?
[1:16:55] <ozuma35> the whisper is useless now anyway
[1:16:57] <%totesmcgoat_> He's gonna hate the answer to that room
[1:17:02] <ozuma35> totally nerfed
[1:17:05] <%Kenori> Fallen...ball?
[1:17:05] <FennecZephyr> Levels dont matter, but armor stats matter
[1:17:09] <+betrayed_llama> Gambit Prime is faster
[1:17:10] <+Fifth5kee> 1 round only
[1:17:11] <+Pyroclase> Gambit Prime is one round, faster, has a mote drain mechanic
[1:17:12] <shinigami40297> Prime has the Prime armor sets and is 1 round
[1:17:13] <+LooglePlatinum> Prime so good
[1:17:15] <%Kenori> You mean Taken Ball?
[1:17:15] <NiktenKing> its gambit on crack
[1:17:16] <%Segartner> Gambit prime is 1 round
[1:17:16] <%dekkitout> 1 round
[1:17:17] <+Pyroclase> It's bascically an improved version of gambit
[1:17:18] <mr_red117> Armor set buffs
[1:17:20] <ghostofsolomon> use your abilities when you have the chance
[1:17:21] <%totesmcgoat_> @ozuma35 no no no no It's still burst dps king
[1:17:22] <startstoprepeat> gambit prime has specific armor that grants you role-based buffs that you get from reckoning
[1:17:22] <Tucker0603> you can get gear with people is for Gambit prime
[1:17:23] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Prime is one round, 3 invades, and you get unique armor for it
[1:17:24] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Prime you have armor sets that give bonus', thats the "Role" thing
[1:17:25] <+Pyroclase> Role is based on the armor you wear, which you have none of
[1:17:25] <Sullry> Armor sets from reckoning do cool shit
[1:17:26] <nademonkey1100> 1 round harder boss invaders do more
[1:17:30] <%dekkitout> "Choose your role" means the armor sets for playstyles
[1:17:30] <Pillagius> @Copperama you can win against "end game player" mostly by accident. Stuff like Luna's Howl or Unforgotten hand canons are too OP :D
[1:17:32] <%DukeAtomic> Gambit Prime has armor sets that have perks that benefit specific roles like Invader, Sentry, Collector, and Reaper
[1:17:33] <OthoZen> one round and special sets give role perks
[1:17:34] <$afronooch> gambit is to quickplay as prime is to comp
[1:17:36] <%Segartner> Is way more intense, and you have specific armor sets for 4 different rolls
[1:17:39] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat play a bit of normal gambit first and get a grasp of the base gameplay
[1:17:40] <shinigami40297> Collector, Reaper, Invader, and Sentry
[1:17:42] <shadowsofpain> in prime theres 4 armors sets that change up the game
[1:17:45] <%Kashi_Nin> @AngriestPat Do you want a tip on that green room? I don't want to spoil the puzzle if you don't want it is all...
[1:17:48] <ozuma35> no dude thats grenade launchers now
[1:17:51] <+LooglePlatinum> same as regular but one round big area plus well of light to kill prime it's really fun and better
[1:17:53] <Rotabrutsama> @AngriestPat when is the next podcast?
[1:17:56] <FennecZephyr> I'd say prime, it's more interesting
[1:17:56] <shadowsofpain> yes and no
[1:17:56] <startstoprepeat> ehhh
[1:17:56] <%Ninestempest> big disagree lol
[1:17:58] <+Ryan1016> Prime is way better
[1:17:59] <+betrayed_llama> nah, Prime is better
[1:18:00] <$valriot> @angriestpat 1 round, 100 mote, 25 for invasions, 2 or more Blockers drains other teams motes
[1:18:00] <%Kashi_Nin> yeah I like regular gambit...
[1:18:01] <nademonkey1100> but there isnt really a ranking in Prime
[1:18:01] <startstoprepeat> yes
[1:18:02] <shadowsofpain> yup
[1:18:03] <Tucker0603> yes
[1:18:06] <%Reaviar> yea you earn em through reckoning
[1:18:07] <+Pyroclase> You have to earn them and the Reckoning, where you get the armor from, is a bit broken
[1:18:08] <Sullry> No
[1:18:09] <%DukeAtomic> You earn them
[1:18:13] <davidevans799> prime is not comp at all
[1:18:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Of course you do.
[1:18:18] <OthoZen> you get those sets in the reckoning
[1:18:19] <SpaceCatStation> you can
[1:18:21] <mr_red117> kind of, you have to make the armor by getting mats from Gambit prime
[1:18:22] <%Reaviar> no you can
[1:18:24] <shinigami40297> Collector gives buffs to motes and blockers, Reaper is buffs to killing pve ads, Reaper is buffs to invading, and Sentry is killing invaders
[1:18:24] <+betrayed_llama> you can
[1:18:24] <%DukeAtomic> Gambit Prime
[1:18:25] <%Segartner> you can
[1:18:25] <+informedotaku> that a big doll house for all those space dolls
[1:18:25] <Tucker0603> you can
[1:18:26] <shadowsofpain> in reckoning
[1:18:27] <%Ninestempest> you can do prime without the armor sets, it's fine
[1:18:27] <%DukeAtomic> no you can go in there
[1:18:27] <%Kashi_Nin> you can go in
[1:18:29] <nademonkey1100> you can thats how you get the prime armor
[1:18:30] <+Sibroma> You have to to get the materials to make the armor
[1:18:30] <%Segartner> you'¬¥ll just suck
[1:18:31] <%DukeAtomic> There's a questline from the Drifter
[1:18:34] <Tucker0603> you just won't have the buffs
[1:18:40] <%DukeAtomic> The Reckoning is above Gambit Prime
[1:18:42] <ozuma35> @pat do you have vanguard tokens?
[1:18:42] <%Zamorouskiwhich> No you can. Just other people have full sets of OP armor because they play too much 4Head
[1:18:44] <Sullry> You can but you won‚Äôt have the perks
[1:18:44] <%Kashi_Nin> the armor just gives bonuses and acts like a job system
[1:18:44] <+Sibroma> Or to at least start the quest if you haven't yet
[1:18:45] <%dekkitout> TL;DR Gambit Prime's loop is borked to hell
[1:18:46] <+LooglePlatinum> does the strum count as hand canon kills?
[1:18:47] <SpaceCatStation> gambit has stuff
[1:18:48] <Sullry> Gambit
[1:18:49] <MasterDecoder> Collectors are focused on grabbing Motes, Reaper on Kills, Sentry for killing Invaders and Blockers, and Invaders for Invade. @AngriestPat You can totally go into Prime without the armor, go talk to Drifter
[1:18:49] <%President_Miyazaki> Sturm is probably the easiest hand cannon to get the gambit kills with.
[1:18:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Gotta keep doing the quests
[1:18:52] <%Kenori> Don't worry about Reckoning right now that was for the Driftor Season you'll get that naturally later.
[1:18:53] <%DukeAtomic> You need to unlock it from The Drifter @AngriestPat
[1:18:56] <%Kenori> Do quests
[1:18:58] <%DukeAtomic> There's a questline for it
[1:18:58] <%Segartner> That's how you get the armor
[1:19:00] <+LooglePlatinum> Gambit
[1:19:00] <shinigami40297> You earn the armor sets by getting tokens from doing things in gambit prime/doing gambit prime bounties then using them in the Reckoning activity
[1:19:05] <%dekkitout> Play Prime, play Reckoning, repeat
[1:19:06] <Sullry> Quest from drifter
[1:19:08] <shadowsofpain> you have to get a synthesizer from Drifter
[1:19:12] <LancerJammer> @AngriestPat you need to talk with the drifter on the tower firtst
[1:19:12] <+informedotaku> hanedcannon from reckoning so good
[1:19:16] <+betrayed_llama> Some are
[1:19:17] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat wish I was in a voice chat so I could help explain everything to you
[1:19:21] <OthoZen> everybody does
[1:19:21] <+redribbonvinny> yeah the Reckoning/Gambit Prime gameplay loop is kinda dumb
[1:19:29] <startstoprepeat> most of the new quests are account wide, it's mainly older stuff that's character based
[1:19:29] <Sullry> YES
[1:19:40] <%DukeAtomic> They're transitioning to making them account wide more in the future
[1:19:41] <SpaceCatStation> but that just means playing Warlock and really what's the downside
[1:19:42] <+Pyroclase> They are making NEW quests accoutn wide
[1:19:43] <%dekkitout> I think it's just the pinnacles that are account wide
[1:19:45] <shadowsofpain> it was neat but it veered too far
[1:19:47] <%Segartner> you don't need to do the weapon exotic quests on all characters
[1:19:48] <+d00msdaydan> You can just do the exotic quests on one character and then pull a dupe from collections for your other characters
[1:19:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> but I want multiple tho
[1:19:51] <+LooglePlatinum> gotta go back to work nice seeing you all for a short time
[1:19:52] <%dekkitout> The newest 3 I mean
[1:19:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> When you realize gambit prime us space wizard quidditch
[1:19:55] <+Pyroclase> But it takes work to update old quests to be account wide and there only so much dev time
[1:19:58] <+angel949> starting with season of opulence they will be
[1:20:00] <$valriot> That's a recent thing, most stuff since Season 6 is account wide now @angriestpat
[1:20:09] <+Ryan1016> Pinnacles became account wide 2 seasons ago iirc
[1:20:11] <LancerJammer> Ding ding ding ding
[1:20:11] <Animorphimagi> Does he know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:20:12] <+Pyroclase> @angel949 It's been the season of opulence for a month
[1:20:15] <%Kenori> Huh..so I'm looking at my secondary titan and I dont have Drang available...thats WILD
[1:20:16] <ozuma35> well delete them then
[1:20:17] <%Kenori> that SUUUUCKs
[1:20:20] <shinigami40297> Exotic quests are not account wide and likely never will be
[1:20:21] <MasterDecoder> Sadly
[1:20:24] <%Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat gambi prime armour basicly lets you spec into one of three or 4 roles, IE do you do better at killing blockers? killing chumps, Collecting Motes or Inavding and the armour gives ua bonus for each thing
[1:20:25] <+Pyroclase> yes Pat, sadly
[1:20:25] <%Segartner> just delet them
[1:20:27] <+Ryan1016> Or just delete em
[1:20:33] <shadowsofpain> you can abandon them and they wont show up on your map
[1:20:36] <%dekkitout> No, you can just transfer the weapon/ abandon the quest for later
[1:20:37] <MasterDecoder> @Segartner Some can't be
[1:20:39] <shinigami40297> No just do them on 1 and delete them on the rest
[1:20:39] <+informedotaku> live with it ;p
[1:20:41] <dero45> Yup
[1:20:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Dont just consume product and wait for new product! Consume product multiple times!
[1:20:44] <ozuma35> no....no they wont
[1:20:45] <FennecZephyr> I dont think they can retroactively make things account wide, but they're trying to do it going forward
[1:20:46] <%greenhathero> i thought that was sub zero for a second
[1:20:47] <+Ryan1016> On the second page hidden
[1:20:50] <OthoZen> mind goblins
[1:20:52] <startstoprepeat> ?????????
[1:20:53] <+Pyroclase> This is why I only really play on my Titan
[1:20:54] <+QuasartheHero> Sick streamlabs isnt workin rn
[1:20:54] <%Kashi_Nin> wait what now?
[1:20:57] <%dekkitout> It's dumb we know, what can we say
[1:20:59] <%Kashi_Nin> gobins ok
[1:21:01] <+QuasartheHero> Fuckin
[1:21:06] <%Kashi_Nin> goblins
[1:21:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat, why aren't you using shaders?
[1:21:09] <+JonoSnow126> i thought the exotic quests in the pursuits tab were account-wide
[1:21:10] <+Pyroclase> Drang reloads Sturm by the way\
[1:21:10] <ElBuraindo> SWITCH THE GUN
[1:21:10] <%Kashi_Nin> gobins are bad too
[1:21:14] <Animorphimagi> Does he know he missed the gamescom first night stream
[1:21:14] <%Segartner> yeah but that's some ocd shit right there
[1:21:15] <+QuasartheHero> bitterScree bitterScree bitterScree bitterScree
[1:21:16] <%GarbageNirvana> The way you're supposed to do it now I think is keep the good rolls and dismantle the bad
[1:21:18] <%CuddlyZombie> Pat I am with you on this 100% I have these goblins too
[1:21:22] <%GarbageNirvana> And then use the higher-power bad rolls to buff the good ones
[1:21:23] <+AngrySpaceLlama51> Just discard the quest
[1:21:24] <+informedotaku> sharing is caring
[1:21:26] <mayorrev> those are mineeeee
[1:21:28] <%VioletHeart> Is that even goblins to be annoyed about having to *avoid* doing content?
[1:21:33] <%TubeMan642> Yeah banshee still wants my hunter and titan to get the ace of spades
[1:21:36] <shadowsofpain> by the way you have to kill invaders with hand cannons
[1:21:45] <ElBuraindo> nice
[1:21:46] <MasterDecoder> Team game Pat, share your Motes @AngriestPat
[1:21:56] <%totesmcgoat_> Oh man, I forgot this grind was not great for HC kills
[1:21:57] <+QuasartheHero> bitterBirth
[1:22:02] <%Segartner> NICE
[1:22:04] <shinigami40297> Nah the changed the ace quest its either kill the invader with a hand cannon or get a bunch of kills with a hand cannon
[1:22:04] <cronicconquest> Pew pew pew
[1:22:05] <%totesmcgoat_> Good jorb
[1:22:07] <MasterDecoder> @shadowsofpain That's how it USED to be
[1:22:11] <KaliasTV> The 10 mote blockers are huge jerks
[1:22:16] <ElBuraindo> use portal
[1:22:20] <%President_Miyazaki> That alone was more help than you did in both rounds of the first game today.
[1:22:25] <%dekkitout> This map's portals are great for anti-invades
[1:22:32] <coldsama> Don't greed, when the enemy have stored at least 25 motes they can start invading
[1:22:39] <+betrayed_llama> @AngriestPat You're pretty lucky that they nerfed the requirements for this quest, you used to have get invader kills with a handcannon.
[1:22:43] <+Pyroclase> Sturm and Drang reload each other BTW
[1:22:46] <%totesmcgoat_> Nope, the blockers are in fact, blocking
[1:22:49] <nademonkey1100> pat NO
[1:22:55] <%dekkitout> PopCorn
[1:23:03] <SpaceCatStation> PogChamp
[1:23:04] <%Mekhet09> Mekhet09 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months!

[1:24:01] <%Ninestempest> iut's fine to solo ult with that, cause he can end it early and save super
[1:24:04] <startstoprepeat> why would you ever want to turn off the drifter
[1:24:12] <%totesmcgoat_> Good panic super though
[1:24:16] <shinigami40297> Why would you want to turn off my sweet boi the drifter
[1:24:18] <shadowsofpain> as long as they wasted an invade that was good
[1:24:20] <pharaohaegyptus> Did that say Ally's
[1:24:22] <%dekkitout> You sure you don't main titan tajC
[1:24:52] <%President_Miyazaki> Oh shit, I didn't realize that bungie changed the quest to make it so all kills in gambit count towards it.
[1:24:59] <%President_Miyazaki> I wish it was like that before!
[1:25:00] <ElBuraindo> one more
[1:25:02] <+mrcooperblack> idk why i'm not surprised to see a warlock the first go round
[1:25:03] <%worldbrand> hello fellow stadies
[1:25:05] <%Harawanagangsta> WHOS TALKING?
[1:25:08] <%SolverCODO> o fucc im gonna proud,,!
[1:25:08] <+redribbonvinny> remember when people complained about the Ace of Spades quest getting changed?
[1:25:12] <%dekkitout> Space Hobo says good jorb
[1:25:15] <shadowsofpain> oh yeah they made this step easier
[1:25:16] <+betrayed_llama> Team-mates are not banking NotLikeThis
[1:25:19] <%tumzFESTIVAL> call me PRIDE BOIVIN
[1:25:22] <Zebroneath> Wish there was an option to turn down the chatter.
[1:25:22] <cronicconquest> Kill them pat
[1:25:23] <%Harawanagangsta> Is this just index?
[1:25:24] <shadowsofpain> it used to be a pain
[1:25:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat invaders are worth WAY more
[1:25:41] <nademonkey1100> invaders give more points
[1:25:45] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, it used to just be killing players, which was AWFUL
[1:25:47] <+Kriptin> INVADER, HEY THAT'S ENO-HOSTILES AT THE B- BANK AND YOU GET A PRIMEVAL
[1:25:49] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat you can also pop open your ghost to see your tracked quest
[1:25:49] <ElBuraindo> lol
[1:25:52] <+redribbonvinny> originally was just invaders.
[1:25:53] <shinigami40297> its like 4 invader kills or 100 enemy kills
[1:25:56] <cronicconquest> Yeah its the new one
[1:26:01] <+jordanstayshome> what is Pat grinding for now?
[1:26:04] <Tucker0603> they all take forever complete
[1:26:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> might be worth looking into how Sturm and Drang interact with eachother, @AngriestPat
[1:26:13] <+redribbonvinny> @jordanstayshome Ace
[1:26:15] <SpaceCatStation> @jordanstayshome Ace
[1:26:18] <%President_Miyazaki> Also yeah, catalysts take a while sometimes. One of the later steps will help a bit, 250 handcannon kills in Strikes.
[1:26:19] <+jordanstayshome> cool thanks
[1:26:22] <%totesmcgoat_> Catalysts are a grind
[1:26:36] <%dekkitout> Strum is like 100, Drang is like 500. I farmed them in the first raid's big center area
[1:26:39] <+Kriptin> The one that took longest for me was 25 precision kills in crucible.
[1:26:51] <%totesmcgoat_> He has hammerhead, stay up close to invaders that use it
[1:27:02] <%totesmcgoat_> He'll decimate entire teams at range
[1:27:07] <%President_Miyazaki> I was lucky enough to have Sturms catalyst before doing this, which gives big boost to range.
[1:27:12] <mayorrev> can you name your gun Elmo
[1:27:13] <+betrayed_llama> no revive PepeHands
[1:27:17] <+gatoralus> his fov seems low to me or maybe im crazy
[1:27:30] <+Kriptin> What about The First Vowel
[1:27:32] <ElBuraindo> he killed four
[1:27:49] <+redribbonvinny> man if Pat couldn't do the jumping puzzle for Whisper then I doubt he could do Zero Hour
[1:27:58] <+BSplitz> what's his power level right now?
[1:28:02] <+betrayed_llama> You guys are taking too long LUL
[1:28:07] <mrblack499> are you losing or winning
[1:28:08] <+Kriptin> Zero Hour is doable he just needs a friendo
[1:28:11] <+Pyroclase> I want Pat to meet TREVOR though
[1:28:11] <+gatoralus> ah okay im just used to 100
[1:28:12] <suikudo> bastards took away my quest for malfesance
[1:28:17] <mrblack499> cant tell
[1:28:18] <mayorrev> are ya winnin son?
[1:28:23] <+Pyroclase> It's a shame they fixed the cheese for Zero Hour
[1:28:29] <+Kriptin> Oh no
[1:28:33] <+Kriptin> I can't cheese it
[1:28:36] <+Pyroclase> You do not have a minute left, weird
[1:28:37] <+Kriptin> Why?
[1:28:40] <+redribbonvinny> HOL UP A MINUTE! Pat, what part of the jumping puzzle did you guys get stuck on?
[1:28:41] <+Kriptin> Do they hate fun?
[1:28:42] <possumwalsh1221> Annnnd now I wanna play destiny today
[1:28:59] <coldsama> Lmao the enemy team still don't have summoned their primeval
[1:29:00] <+jordanstayshome> 10 stacks of prime evil Slayer is insane
[1:29:08] <+Ryan1016> You can now
[1:29:08] <KaliasTV> Rubberbanding
[1:29:12] <+betrayed_llama> you can invade
[1:29:12] <+Pyroclase> You can inavde over and over when the enemy team's primeval is up
[1:29:14] <%aishman> You can, it's just one invader
[1:29:15] <%sjay449> you can now
[1:29:17] <%Kenori> Its a comeback mechanic when they are down
[1:29:18] <%aishman> See the thing is open RIGHT NOW
[1:29:19] <ElBuraindo> your team is not invading back
[1:29:19] <%dekkitout> Because you had your Primeval before their's
[1:29:20] <%sjay449> it's a catchup mechanic
[1:29:21] <+Kriptin> When the primeval is summoned they can invade and vice versa.
[1:29:21] <+Ryan1016> It's literally up right now
[1:29:22] <%aishman> Go and invade!
[1:29:22] <%Kenori> Also WOW THATS A LOT OF STACKS
[1:29:22] <%Segartner> Because you were winning
[1:29:25] <%Kenori> ATTACK THE PRIMEVAL!
[1:29:26] <%dekkitout> It's "balanced"
[1:29:26] <mr_red117> catch up mechanic
[1:29:27] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat if your team gets a summon the other team gets to invade more frequently till they summon as well
[1:29:29] <+gatoralus> hey pat what made you wanna get back into destiny anyways? all the shadowkeep buzz?
[1:29:33] <%aishman> The invading protal is open!
[1:29:37] <%aishman> You just need to jump through it
[1:29:40] <Animorphimagi> Does Pat know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:29:40] <soullesskin> You can do the same pat you just have to listen and keep and eye out for the portal
[1:29:41] <possumwalsh1221> When your portal opens nobody is going through lul
[1:29:43] <Pillagius> invade?
[1:29:49] <TheBigTaco> This is the slowest match ever lmao
[1:29:49] <coldsama> It was all going well until your team started unplugging the brain
[1:29:49] <shadowsofpain> when your team has a prime evil the enemy team can go disrupt
[1:29:53] <+mrcooperblack> Invasions in gambit depend on how far along you are. its not as much of a catchup mechanic as it is a f*ck you mechanic
[1:29:56] <%Kenori> Your team is terrible
[1:30:02] <%Kenori> They arent attackign the primeval

[1:31:03] <StarvingPenguinGod> MVP Pog
[1:31:05] <possumwalsh1221> Literally was 100% pat for once
[1:31:06] <+Pyroclase> And one stack from killing the envoys
[1:31:06] <%Ninestempest> gill the withces and you get stacks
[1:31:08] <+jordanstayshome> killing envoys
[1:31:09] <shinigami40297> time as you fail to kill it

[1:31:11] <nademonkey1100> killing the envoys
[1:31:11] <+Ryan1016> Kill the envoys then they go up over time
[1:31:16] <SirTeabottom> I clapped when I saw it
[1:31:17] <Sullry> Envoy kills
[1:31:19] <%Kenori> Every Envoy (the witches) you kill gives you a stack

[1:31:21] <%Kashi_Nin> kill envoys and over time
[1:31:23] <%Kashi_Nin> yep
[1:31:28] <coldsama> Pat you are clearly MVP of this game
[1:31:29] <%dekkitout> Killing the evoys(wizards)/catchup mechanic
[1:31:30] <$afronooch> killing the envoys starts the buff, but it happens over time if they are dead or not
[1:31:32] <+redribbonvinny> I wonder if Pat was stuck in the Green Room jumping puzzle for the Whisper mission...
[1:31:33] <shinigami40297> its a you cant do dps so we buff your damage mechanic
[1:31:35] <%XxPatchworkxX> PogChamp100
[1:31:38] <$shurtal> i always like drang, made me feel like i was killing things with uranium coated spitballs
[1:32:03] <Animorphimagi> Does Pat know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:32:04] <jeffishype> This look uh
[1:32:15] <+alphonseisbest> !uptime
[1:32:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 32m.
[1:32:28] <SpaceCatStation> pat your team is trash, bank 15 motes
[1:32:49] <possumwalsh1221> Where the heck do you get that gun pat‚Äôs using
[1:32:56] <%dekkitout> Quest
[1:33:02] <+Pyroclase> nooooooooo
[1:33:04] <suikudo> oh no
[1:33:05] <+betrayed_llama> You would definitely benefit from using a special weapon like a shotgun or fusion rifle
[1:33:05] <+Ryan1016> LUL
[1:33:06] <+d00msdaydan> @possumwalsh1221 nessus questline
[1:33:08] <jeffishype> rip
[1:33:10] <KaliasTV> Captains are absurdly lethal for a 10 mote blocker
[1:33:10] <Pequod1> I thought this game was easy
[1:33:12] <+MisterAngryEyes112> captains suck.
[1:33:12] <SpaceCatStation> WutFace
[1:33:17] <Shastafield> heated gamer moment
[1:33:17] <%Nobrev> vineGreed
[1:33:21] <Sullry> Captains are the worst
[1:33:28] <suikudo> damn thats all she wrote
[1:33:31] <%Kenori> It happens
[1:33:31] <flatty1000> those enemies feeling real spongy
[1:33:32] <SirTeabottom> minkas in chat
[1:33:33] <%Kenori> Captains suck
[1:33:39] <%DukeAtomic> 11 blockers down the drain
[1:33:44] <%dekkitout> Could you believe they were knights instead? CoolStoryBob
[1:33:48] <%TubeMan642> Are ya feelin it now Mr. @AngriestPat ?
[1:34:09] <+Pyroclase> YUour team is getting THRASHED jeez
[1:34:11] <+Zxtole> Basically have to play like a cover shooter
[1:34:17] <coldsama> Did your team just go afk or something?
[1:34:18] <%totesmcgoat_> That's why Sturm/Drang isn't a great combo. It's garbage against anything above a normal add
[1:34:20] <+betrayed_llama> The opposing team is pretty pissed now LUL
[1:34:31] <mrblack499> Time to lift
[1:34:36] <BigBrandon907> In all my years of being a TBFP fan, I can't believe Pat is playing Destiny lol
[1:34:44] <%dekkitout> On the brightside, now you can Zerg the Invades
[1:34:48] <%totesmcgoat_> You have 7
[1:34:51] <BigBrandon907> It's awesome
[1:34:58] <possumwalsh1221> 7 vs the boss omegalul
[1:34:59] <+Zxtole> Destiny is a number go up name, seems like he would like it
[1:35:09] <redrins> this is just sad
[1:35:13] <+Zxtole> Game*
[1:35:20] <%Kenori> Thats Destiny Multiplayer
[1:35:22] <%Segartner> YOUCH
[1:35:27] <%Kenori> Sometimes you jjust get bad luck
[1:35:29] <%Kenori> Sorry Pat
[1:35:31] <shadowsofpain> time for sudden death round
[1:35:35] <%dekkitout> Tie breaker is gonna be FUN
[1:35:39] <%Kenori> But you should get a lot of portals to invade with
[1:35:43] <BigBrandon907> Last game was dope though, that invade you had was sick
[1:35:45] <$valriot> It be like that sometimes
[1:35:50] <%Kenori> So you can get those good juicy revolver invasion
[1:35:51] <%Kenori> s
[1:36:03] <cronicconquest> This is called an Old-fashioned Ass Whopping
[1:36:06] <%Kenori> Ugh shotguns
[1:36:07] <davidevans799> blind
[1:36:08] <$Mothman742> at least in the sudden death round u can spam ur super
[1:36:09] <therakishsage> Blindness is bad.
[1:36:13] <TheHeroAppears> he got knocked away by the blast
[1:36:22] <+Pyroclase> at least this way he gets to see sudden death
[1:36:23] <+Ryan1016> part of the event
[1:36:24] <%demegodz> buff
[1:36:27] <%dekkitout> That a solstice thing
[1:36:32] <%TubeMan642> Pat you should use pulse grenades instead of arc bolt
[1:36:34] <+JayBo_Vizard> the charge that you have on the side of your screen is for the event it's not really important for Gambit
[1:36:36] <%Segartner> "Watch how this goblin gets destroyed by a shotgun ape"
[1:36:37] <%Nobrev> solstice event thing
[1:36:37] <ElBuraindo> they saw you
[1:36:39] <+Ryan1016> LMG
[1:36:41] <+Pyroclase> LMGs, pat
[1:36:41] <Daxalog> Revel'd
[1:36:42] <KaliasTV> Machine guns are really lethal for invade
[1:36:43] <%Harawanagangsta> Is Pats character the one talking?
[1:36:43] <suikudo> Really OP weapons
[1:36:43] <%Yadogari> Guns Pat
[1:36:44] <%Kenori> That was a LMG

[1:36:44] <%aishman> Hammerhead LMG
[1:36:45] <ElBuraindo> hammerhead is STRONK
[1:36:45] <+Pyroclase> Hammerhead is an LMG
[1:36:46] <therakishsage> You do go in there glowing bright red.
[1:36:46] <possumwalsh1221> Guns
[1:36:47] <+jjhoho> hey this is irrelevant, but can someone help me? i vividly remember pat and maybe woolie talking about a fighting game character who's a black dude in robes and a pimp cane. he might be blind. does anyone remember who that is
[1:36:47] <meermadon> I have no recollection of when the turnaround point for Destiny 2 was, I just know it was hated when it came out and now seems to be pretty beloved
[1:36:48] <rosemon5001> yea he literally passed right infront of you the first time and you didnt notice
[1:36:49] <cronicconquest> Heavy
[1:36:49] <%demegodz> a machinegun

[1:38:46] <+Sibroma> That's Gambit baybee!
[1:38:51] <KaliasTV> That immunity add, guaranteed to ruin any super
[1:38:52] <ElBuraindo> you better win this Pat
[1:38:58] <+betrayed_llama> @AngriestPat If you kill the meatball you get an exotic quest
[1:39:05] <%dekkitout> Welcom to Gambit, bring a sword ! BrokeBack
[1:39:06] <%Kenori> His team is bads, he wont win this
[1:39:10] <+jamiam1027> its a shitty exotic anyway
[1:39:14] <coldsama> Gosh your team is awful beyond words, did they forget to equip guns?
[1:39:19] <ElBuraindo> INVADE
[1:39:23] <%aishman> INVAAADe
[1:39:26] <+Pyroclase> the gun isn't great anyway

[1:39:40] <Ion_Laser> @jjhoho The fgc character they were talking about is Leroy Smith in Tekken 7
[1:39:40] <TheHeroAppears> does each team get a different boss?
[1:39:40] <%tinkerinks> tinkerinks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! ah yes here's to another year
[1:39:40] <+jordanstayshome> meatball is common now though
[1:39:41] <MasterDecoder> @Pyroclase You're out of your mind
[1:39:42] <+JayBo_Vizard> pat I could reach you the ways of Gambit!
[1:39:45] <%Kenori> The only reason they won the first game was because of you
[1:39:45] <startstoprepeat> it's cool, he'll show up again. meatball's a lot less rare than it used to be.
[1:39:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Your team let you down
[1:39:48] <+ImpHelpSingIt> you gotta shloot the shloot
[1:39:49] <%25RPM> your team was grabage
[1:39:49] <slyarvicle08> Hello @AngriestPat and People, how's everybody?
[1:39:49] <possumwalsh1221> Gambit advice, if you can invade DO IT
[1:39:55] <$Mothman742> that team sucked major doodoo
[1:39:55] <+Pyroclase> I don't have Malfeasance but it lacks a good damage or reload perk, so eh
[1:39:57] <%Zamorouskiwhich> FeelsBadMan The handcannon is bad anyway, don't feel bad. Great invades though!
[1:39:57] <cronicconquest> Teacher Pat is a Scrub
[1:39:58] <%Kashi_Nin> helmut!
[1:40:03] <AmericanaRed> WARFRAME 2 PogChamp PogChamp
[1:40:10] <+jordanstayshome> did you grab the bounties for Gambit?
[1:40:12] <+jamiam1027> @AngriestPat yea if you kill the meatball you get a quest for a shitty exotic hand cannon
[1:40:21] <%Kenori> Main everyone gets cool gambit shit but the Hunter
[1:40:25] <startstoprepeat> hey, malfeasance is great
[1:40:25] <%Kenori> I hate the hunter gambit gear :/
[1:40:25] <ElBuraindo> did they nerf the Malfeasance requirements?
[1:40:26] <MasterDecoder> @jamiam1027 You also are out of your mind
[1:40:27] <+informedotaku> sbfpSetIn
[1:40:29] <SpaceCatStation> @AngriestPat you should use something like a fusion rifle or shotgun in your second slot to help deal with blockers
[1:40:31] <$valriot> Yeah if you kill that boss you'll get access to a long and annoying quest for a Exotic Hand Cannon
[1:40:35] <+jordanstayshome> easy gear and xp
[1:40:35] <shadowsofpain> go talk to olde Drifter
[1:40:37] <BigBrandon907> Don't listen to chat Malfeasance isn't all that bad lol. It's pretty good against blockers
[1:40:45] <%Starlight_Gamer> how do you get last word and is it good?
[1:40:48] <+betrayed_llama> Malfeasance is great against taken, thats it
[1:40:48] <KaliasTV> Almost all the catalysts are big grinds
[1:40:48] <+Pyroclase> At least it isn't Polaris Lance
[1:40:51] <vergil44> @vergil44 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:40:51] <%Supertoaster02> Is pat on ps4 or pc?
[1:40:52] <%Segartner> You can go to the Anex in the tower and get bounties from the drifter
[1:40:53] <%demegodz> @angriestpat drifter has bounties for Gambit at the tower
[1:40:53] <+Ryan1016> Catalysts are all just get kills with weapon
[1:40:53] <BlacSoul> Watching this makes me wanna get back in...but i know better
[1:40:55] <sirrice77> all catalysts are a huge grind
[1:40:55] <SpaceCatStation> Malfeasance is a good Gambit weapon
[1:40:56] <+JayBo_Vizard> that handca no. is great in gambit. at least for my build. I use malf, sniper, hammerhead. the 5 shot damage is great
[1:40:56] <%Zamorouskiwhich> All catalysts are nasty to do. They take forever...
[1:40:57] <mr_red117> that's all catalysts
[1:40:58] <ElBuraindo> Malfeasance is a cool gun, shut up gameplaydorks
[1:41:00] <startstoprepeat> there's a room in the whisper mission that you can farm any catalyst for in record time
[1:41:01] <%dekkitout> Catalysts were implemented as time sinks back in Warmind
[1:41:01] <%totesmcgoat_> That's kinda all catalysts
[1:41:02] <+jjhoho> i was trying to remember leeroy smith i figured it out
[1:41:03] <AmericanaRed> You should overwatch
[1:41:04] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat it could be much worse, this is an easy one
[1:41:07] <+Pyroclase> the Catalyst for Polaris Lance requires kills with the dot left by the its expolosion, no even the explosion itself
[1:41:09] <$valriot> Catalysts are all omegagrind
[1:41:11] <%dekkitout> Worldline Zero ResidentSleeper
[1:41:11] <+informedotaku> you know you love it
[1:41:23] <$valriot> Graviton Lance Catalyst took me FOREVER
[1:41:24] <+Pyroclase> I can't type pat I am sorry
[1:41:26] <%Harawanagangsta> Kojima is making a Real Life Pokedex of Celebrities
[1:41:36] <shadowsofpain> Malfeasance is a 180 hand cannon, considering bloom
[1:41:37] <%beetbo2> Would anyone recommend getting this game when it‚Äôs on steam?
[1:41:37] <TalekAetem> Rate of Fire
[1:41:39] <Tucker0603> that's a solid role
[1:41:40] <+jamiam1027> 180 rpm
[1:41:40] <+JayBo_Vizard> fire rate
[1:41:41] <ElBuraindo> a faster handcannon
[1:41:42] <%totesmcgoat_> rpm
[1:41:43] <SpaceCatStation> LUL
[1:41:44] <%Segartner> Rate of fire
[1:41:44] <mr_red117> 180RPM
[1:41:44] <+gatoralus> the RPM
[1:41:46] <%Zamorouskiwhich> 180 Fire rate
[1:41:49] <%Kenori> WOW FUCK THAt
[1:41:49] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat rounds per minute
[1:41:49] <TalekAetem> USE IT
[1:41:50] <%dekkitout> tajPF
[1:41:50] <%Segartner> LOL
[1:41:52] <TalekAetem> BETTER
[1:41:53] <startstoprepeat> way better roll
[1:41:54] <+betrayed_llama> GARBAGE LUL
[1:41:54] <+Ryan1016> Try ten paces and try to not use double primary, you'll do better @AngriestPat
[1:41:55] <Ion_Laser> :D
[1:41:55] <%Ninestempest> ayy free infusion fuel
[1:41:55] <AmericanaRed> OWL2019blood
[1:41:56] <Tucker0603> lol shit role
[1:41:57] <%Kenori> Fuck 100% of that
[1:41:58] <KaliasTV> The synergy Kappa
[1:41:58] <ElBuraindo> >hip fire
[1:42:00] <%Kenori> Use it as infusion fuel
[1:42:00] <%Segartner> Shit role!
[1:42:02] <MasterDecoder> Hey, losers complaining about MAlfeasance, what's your deal? It's the best Archetype, it's infinitely better in Gambit than in Crucible
[1:42:04] <%dekkitout> THOSE ARE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE LUL
[1:42:04] <%Segartner> But you got it
[1:42:05] <nademonkey1100> fucking garbo
[1:42:09] <TalekAetem> Timed Payload SUCKS
[1:42:10] <+betrayed_llama> It isnt
[1:42:12] <+Ryan1016> No they're both similarly garbage
[1:42:12] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Bad, but better than your current roll LUL
[1:42:12] <mr_red117> infuse
[1:42:12] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat if you infuse the same gun it'll be cheaper to infuse
[1:42:14] <Arweynn> infuse
[1:42:15] <startstoprepeat> threat detector sucks, moving target owns
[1:42:19] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Moving target isn't TERRIBLE
[1:42:25] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Is pretty good
[1:42:26] <+jamiam1027> they're both pretty shit
[1:42:29] <shadowsofpain> so 180 hand cannons dont have bloom since they are precision frame types
[1:42:32] <SpaceCatStation> they both suck but timed payload is awful
[1:42:32] <+JayBo_Vizard> you don't need your best light level equipped items they just need to be your inventory for the best light level drops
[1:42:32] <Tucker0603> KEEP THE TIMED PAYLOAD
[1:42:34] <ElBuraindo> yeah it's a better perk at least
[1:42:42] <cronicconquest> Both are shit
[1:42:42] <%dekkitout> It's 1 power level, don't even bother
[1:42:49] <%Kenori> Blyet
[1:42:57] <BigBrandon907> That Last Perdition you have is pretty solid
[1:42:59] <Tucker0603> TIMED payload is great in pvp
[1:43:00] <shadowsofpain> go talk to drifter in the left side of the tower
[1:43:03] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Only infuse if the difference is 4 or more
[1:43:10] <Animorphimagi> Does Pat know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:43:10] <+Pyroclase> Go get bounties from Drifter
[1:43:17] <+informedotaku> buy tiny sparrow
[1:43:18] <Tucker0603> yes
[1:43:23] <+betrayed_llama> more damage
[1:43:24] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Eh, not really
[1:43:29] <BigBrandon907> Timed payload psudeo increases your range
[1:43:30] <Tucker0603> because it ignore damage dropoff
[1:43:32] <+MisterAngryEyes112> It's...ok
[1:43:33] <Arweynn> double flinch
[1:43:33] <+Ryan1016> Timed payload is not more damage
[1:43:36] <+Zxtole> If you keep typing that question you might get an answer in about an hour
[1:43:36] <%dekkitout> Timed Payload splits your damage, no?
[1:43:42] <%Segartner> did i just see 31000 silver dust?
[1:43:43] <+Ryan1016> They changed that chat, it follows dmg drop off now
[1:43:46] <+angel949> it can cause people to miss there shots also
[1:43:46] <shadowsofpain> timed payload is good since it's not effected by damage fall off
[1:43:50] <%Segartner> or did i see 3100
[1:43:51] <+runesco> oof felt that walking to the old area
[1:43:52] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Thats here Dritor used to be FeelsBadMan
[1:43:52] <+mrcooperblack> timed payload's biggest boon is because the damage adds up slower so when people take damage they're tricked into thinking they have more health for the fight
[1:43:53] <+JEiddew> wow no one is interested in destiny are they
[1:43:56] <+demon1103> so just found out that crucible is a coin flip. 6 players, only me and one other fighting, others were afk
[1:43:57] <startstoprepeat> timed payload is good if you're engaging at a range you should be using another weapon in
[1:43:57] <+JayBo_Vizard> you only need your highest light level item in your inventory to increase the drop rate of all items, it does not need to be equipped so don't bother infusing for one or two light
[1:43:59] <+informedotaku> Tiny Sparrow
[1:44:07] <+ImpHelpSingIt> badly
[1:44:11] <+jordanstayshome> take all of them
[1:44:14] <%Segartner> get the gambit bounties
[1:44:19] <%Segartner> not the gambit prime ones
[1:44:26] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Prabevals
[1:44:33] <Sullry> Prime bounties if you want reckoning
[1:44:36] <BigBrandon907> It's fun to watch!
[1:44:37] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Gambit is the shit
[1:44:37] <MasterDecoder> Gambit is good
[1:44:39] <mrblack499> good
[1:44:39] <+Pyroclase> Try a match of Gambit Prime!
[1:44:40] <%Ninestempest> Gambit is a good ass mode
[1:44:42] <%Segartner> PogChamp
[1:44:43] <+jordanstayshome> Gambit good
[1:44:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Gambit is fun until the LMGs show up
[1:44:44] <shadowsofpain> gambit is super fun
[1:44:48] <%Segartner> Having fun PogChamp
[1:44:51] <possumwalsh1221> It‚Äôs such a good mix of pve/pvp
[1:44:51] <+mrcooperblack> just let him dip his toes in before drowning
[1:44:53] <shinigami40297> gambit is fun when its not super sweaty and try hard
[1:44:53] <%Ninestempest> is ophidian still good??
[1:44:54] <startstoprepeat> literally the one thing that needs to change is gambit is the removal of taken armaments
[1:44:54] <+JEiddew> those are strong words
[1:44:58] <%dekkitout> Gambit is fun when both sides are going full sweats
[1:45:01] <%dekkitout> *arent
[1:45:04] <%SlashHabit> Pat, did you cheat to level 50? (with a booster)
[1:45:05] <BlacSoul> is it in base game or an expansion?
[1:45:13] <+JEiddew> you know, THE RESERVES
[1:45:16] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Gambit is fun until you run into super tryhard assholes with machineguns and Truths out the ass
[1:45:20] <+Pyroclase> Uh no that is actualyl a really good perk Pat
[1:45:25] <%SlashHabit> good boi
[1:45:25] <cronicconquest> My god It's THUNDERLORD
[1:45:27] <SpaceCatStation> no that's good you get to ignore reloading
[1:45:27] <%aeravon> Is paige still going to stream DS2 later?
[1:45:27] <FennecZephyr> No, they're really goof together
[1:45:28] <+Pyroclase> 'the extra damage rounds do like 3x as much damage
[1:45:31] <Sullry> Wrong
[1:45:32] <coldsama> Gambit is my favorite thing in Destiny 2,that ane timed missions like Whisper and Zero Hour
[1:45:33] <shadowsofpain> you can get 99 bullets on a strum
[1:45:34] <$valriot> Pat, it lets you 2 tap people in PvP
[1:45:34] <%dekkitout> Strum can hold 99 overcharged bullets btw
[1:45:42] <shinigami40297> its ignores the reload
[1:45:42] <MasterDecoder> ^
[1:45:44] <%Zamorouskiwhich> If you reload the Drang through Strum, you can two tap someone in Crucible with the damage buff
[1:45:45] <+JayBo_Vizard> it causes the round to do extra damage so it's like a super bullet
[1:45:45] <Tucker0603> massive damage pat
[1:45:45] <shadowsofpain> on the magazine
[1:45:45] <+Ryan1016> Sturm and drang is a meme, it's not worth the trouble of switching since the damage output sucks
[1:45:46] <FennecZephyr> Drang can overload sturm with bullets that do like, double damage
[1:45:51] <Sullry> It‚Äôs cool
[1:46:02] <MasterDecoder> Read the perks
[1:46:06] <shadowsofpain> get a lot of kills with the Draig it adds a bullet
[1:46:09] <%dekkitout> Use Drang a lot = more big bullets in Strum
[1:46:14] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Yes
[1:46:16] <mrblack499> Clap
[1:46:19] <+informedotaku> If you reset rank from Gambit you get good stuff btw
[1:46:19] <+JEiddew> ez clap
[1:46:19] <$valriot> BIG DAMAGE
[1:46:20] <+JayBo_Vizard> hooray
[1:46:20] <%25RPM> clap
[1:46:20] <+Pyroclase> Sturm, when overcharged, does enough damage to rank next to shotguns and fusion rifles
[1:46:23] <Animorphimagi> Does Pat know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:46:25] <Tucker0603> yep
[1:46:25] <thetruthofyourbeing> STRUM
[1:46:26] <shinigami40297> the bonus damage is actually pretty high as well you can stach it up and get like a dozen charged rounds
[1:46:27] <%ssjklyco> Sturmdrang
[1:46:29] <TalekAetem> Sturm und Drang
[1:46:31] <+ImpHelpSingIt> but... baaaa baaaa
[1:46:35] <Tucker0603> it can two shot in pvp
[1:46:37] <%Nobrev> you're stupid
[1:46:38] <+JEiddew> videogames are stupid
[1:46:39] <+Takuatt> Man I don't know what the fuck is going on with Destiny but this entire venture has been some quality Pat saying "wtf"
[1:46:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> youre stupid
[1:46:41] <+mrcooperblack> That combo used to be waaaaaaaaaaaaay worse
[1:46:42] <SpaceCatStation> LUL
[1:46:42] <Guktar> why are the load times so long ?
[1:46:44] <Tucker0603> FUCK YOU STURM AND DO ANG RULE
[1:46:44] <mr_red117> yeah, it's a year 1 exptic
[1:46:46] <%jimmytwofeet> NO U STUPID
[1:46:47] <+Ryan1016> Not really when there are much better guns in the game
[1:46:50] <%dekkitout> But it's 'exotic' üåà ‚ú®
[1:46:50] <+informedotaku> nah its a combo
[1:46:53] <+jamiam1027> @AngriestPat yea I haven't played it a while but last I checked they're not the best weapon
[1:46:54] <+JEiddew> what a beautiful drang
[1:46:58] <+TaylOctopus91> There lore is about two lovers. They're a pair Pat.
[1:47:05] <Animorphimagi> Does he know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[1:47:05] <+Zxtole> Destiny doesn't explain shit to anyone
[1:47:08] <KaliasTV> It's kind of fun in easy pve, but not having a green ammo weapon kind of sucks
[1:47:09] <SpaceCatStation> @Guktar what load screens it takes time to fly from planet to planet
[1:47:10] <mrblack499> Reading with Pat
[1:47:17] <Sullry> That‚Äôs a combo, killing shit, call me Rambo
[1:47:18] <+d00msdaydan> Get kills with drang until your sturm has like 20 amped bullets in it
[1:47:18] <+Pyroclase> Sturm and Drang mean Storm and Stress and it's some german literature stuffs
[1:47:20] <%Zamorouskiwhich> So you get a kill with Strum, switch to Drang and get kills, then switch back and get big damage. Like... 101 on headshots in Crucible or something
[1:47:22] <%SlashHabit> oh is the gambit cutscene at 60 now? used to be 30 on pc
[1:47:23] <MasterDecoder> Fun, worst enemy inbound
[1:47:25] <+JEiddew> ngl i have no idea what destiny 2 is even about just that i don't care
[1:47:25] <$vG_Chance> ah console destiny, it's funny how different it is from pc and our range meta
[1:47:27] <startstoprepeat> watch out for bombs
[1:47:27] <+informedotaku> Whats a Destiny?
[1:47:33] <%dekkitout> SCORN! NotLikeThis
[1:47:35] <nademonkey1100> dont worry about it
[1:47:36] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Don't worry abou that
[1:47:38] <KaliasTV> His ship is full of gross
[1:47:39] <Guktar> :/
[1:47:41] <Tucker0603> ask Byf
[1:47:41] <MasterDecoder> It's the inside of his ship, yues
[1:47:41] <+Pyroclase> His ship is gross because he's fucdking with evil shit
[1:47:42] <%Kashi_Nin> its evil bullsh*t
[1:47:42] <$valriot> Drifter has some BULLSHIT going on
[1:47:46] <Sullry> Darkness shit
[1:47:49] <shinigami40297> Drifter has some weird shit going on his ship
[1:47:49] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Don't worry about the derelict, definitely not suspicious at all
[1:47:51] <SpaceCatStation> @vG_Chance this....this is PC
[1:47:53] <+JEiddew> da gaaarrdeenn
[1:47:55] <KnightAsteran> his ship is filled with lore
[1:47:57] <%DedlokPM> I see Pat is the Man with the Golden Gun
[1:47:59] <coldsama> It's lore goo
[1:48:00] <%dekkitout> He's a space hobo who's worst fear is dying, even though he's immortal, that's why
[1:48:03] <%Kashi_Nin> the DAAAaaaaaAAaaaaARRrrrrrrkneessssssss
[1:48:07] <%DedlokPM> You could even say he is Fighting Gold
[1:48:08] <KnightAsteran> Drifter is lore-man
[1:48:10] <%Kashi_Nin> but yeah
[1:48:10] <Sullry> He‚Äôs crazy like some prepper guy, knows about triangle ships
[1:48:14] <%Segartner> @AngriestPat Did you read the lore tweets Byf made in response to you saying "wtf" on twitter?
[1:48:17] <nademonkey1100> fuck scorn man
[1:48:27] <$vG_Chance> @spacecatstation oh dang with a controller? that madman! xD
[1:48:40] <+Ryan1016> Left side
[1:48:42] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Buff on the left
[1:48:45] <+Pyroclase> it says sturm overcharge on the left
[1:48:45] <%dekkitout> "Overcharge"
[1:48:48] <%Gray_skies1993> buff shows on the left
[1:48:54] <Tucker0603> left side on sturm pat
[1:49:03] <+Pyroclase> only when you have sturm out
[1:49:05] <+Ryan1016> Sturm overcharge X (blank)
[1:49:08] <Tucker0603> STURM OVERCHARGE
[1:49:09] <MasterDecoder> ^
[1:49:12] <SpaceCatStation> @vG_Chance nah destiny pc still has aim assist for controllers so it totally works
[1:49:16] <%Zamorouskiwhich> "Strum Overcharge x3"
[1:49:17] <%dekkitout> It literally gives you how many on the left
[1:49:19] <shinigami40297> the bullets you shoot until the overcharge buff runs out are buffed, and the number is indicated by the multiplier
[1:49:20] <+JEiddew> sturm recepticle
[1:49:29] <+mrcooperblack> there's a click every time you activate either reload perk
[1:49:57] <$valriot> POG
[1:49:59] <StarvingPenguinGod> Pog
[1:50:00] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Pog
[1:50:04] <+JEiddew> Pog
[1:50:11] <+Pyroclase> 12 what?
[1:50:13] <TalekAetem> Could of had 3 kills!
[1:50:16] <%dekkitout> You can max out at 99
[1:50:18] <$vG_Chance> @spacecatstation oh i know that, i just ment he's defp handicapping himself against other pc players who can flick shot with snipers n handcannons
[1:50:19] <%Zamorouskiwhich> That was what, 163 on that headshot? Damn
[1:50:22] <suikudo> whoa whoa what weapon was that and how do i get it?
[1:50:29] <%dekkitout> Quest
[1:50:31] <+JEiddew> PogChamp
[1:50:33] <TalekAetem> Planet quest
[1:50:41] <+Pyroclase> Oh yeah
[1:50:41] <shinigami40297> if you farm it you can have like 100 shots before you reload with that buff
[1:50:50] <+Ryan1016> Yeah guns shoot good
[1:50:50] <SpaceCatStation> @vG_Chance aahh that's fair lol
[1:50:53] <%Segartner> oh definetly
[1:50:53] <suikudo> Oh do you need the black armory expansion?
[1:50:56] <+Pyroclase> Wait until you get guns like Wish Ender or Jotun
[1:51:01] <%dekkitout> Sturm is base game
[1:51:01] <%Segartner> have you seen 1000 voices?
[1:51:16] <+Takuatt> If Bungie are good at one thing, its definitely the shooty bang bangs
[1:51:16] <coldsama> @suikudo It's Sturm and Drang, just do the Nessus exotic quest
[1:51:19] <%seraphimjordan> is that a gold space luger?

[1:53:06] <Crankthulhu> The hell is a Xur? Is he like Baro Ki'Teer?
[1:53:14] <MasterDecoder> @Crankthulhu Yes
[1:53:16] <$valriot> Didn't Xur have Geomags this week though?
[1:53:16] <$Mothman742> yesh
[1:53:19] <%SlashHabit> 2 days?
[1:53:28] <+Pyroclase> Not EXACTLY the same but yeah
[1:53:32] <coldsama> @suikudo A raid,a series of quest that allows you to forge any sorts of weapon you want from the Black Armroy and a few exotics, Strum and Drang are from base game tho
[1:53:36] <Arweynn> Xur has face tenacles tho
[1:53:39] <SpaceCatStation> nah he had the uhh wormhusk helm or whatever for warlocks
[1:53:43] <+Pyroclase> Xur has no exclusive items is the thing
[1:53:46] <%Segartner> Baro is every 2 weeks, xur is weekly
[1:53:49] <MasterDecoder> @SlashHabit Xur is now all weekend Fri.-Reset on Tues.
[1:53:50] <%GarbageNirvana> LITERALLY the same
[1:53:53] <%dekkitout> Xur is Baro, but every week, Friday to Monday/Tuesday
[1:53:58] <+allups> guys the Pat know about Remnant From the Ashe
[1:54:04] <+allups> does*
[1:54:09] <+jordanstayshome> skull would be good for pat too, just melt stuff
[1:54:14] <+bonzosan> What's under Baro's helmet tho?
[1:54:16] <shadowsofpain> hit that prime with a Kamehameha
[1:54:31] <greynob> can you not run in this game?
[1:54:38] <+Pyroclase> Yes you can sprint
[1:54:39] <KaliasTV> He had Telesto, Aeon Swift, Verity's Brow and Stronghold this time
[1:54:42] <+Pyroclase> he's sprinting all the time
[1:54:58] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Primeval x10 PogChamp
[1:55:03] <$Mothman742> @angriestpat if u were a stripper wat would ur stripper name be?
[1:55:10] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Never do real damage till Primeval Slayer x5
[1:55:11] <+JayBo_Vizard> how that invaded didn't get pat baffles me
[1:55:13] <+Nomicro4u> nice
[1:55:15] <%dekkitout> tajPF
[1:55:18] <%SlashHabit> man the warlocks fly ability sucks
[1:55:22] <cronicconquest> LUL
[1:55:22] <SpaceCatStation> warlocks be like that
[1:55:27] <%SlashHabit> Titants at least gives you a boost
[1:55:29] <SpaceCatStation> you get used to it
[1:55:36] <MasterDecoder> THey are
[1:55:43] <FirewallStorm> so Pat casted himself off the highest cliff
[1:55:43] <+Nomicro4u> Look at him do the dance
[1:55:45] <SpaceCatStation> nah burst is great you can get some decent speed with it
[1:55:46] <+Pyroclase> Warlock jumps are the hardest to use by also the most versatile
[1:55:49] <%ArcanumMBD> burst is great. People who hate warlock jumps are just bad at them
[1:56:00] <+mrcooperblack> burst glide is your only up up jump really. gotta go up first then forward
[1:56:01] <+JayBo_Vizard> this PC or PS4?
[1:56:01] <KaliasTV> Warlocks walking 1cm down a cliff: Guess I'll die
[1:56:02] <+Pyroclase> also help my text bar is right-aligned help
[1:56:07] <coldsama> Sliding to it's death is a Warlock main goal
[1:56:11] <+Ryan1016> Warlock is simultaneously the best and worst jump in the game, they're meta for speed @AngriestPat
[1:56:13] <MasterDecoder> @ArcanumMBD Titans have the better jump
[1:56:17] <%Kashi_Nin> burst is fine. you have to get used to it. Warlocks fly farther, titans go faster. I like it but I've mained it since 2014
[1:56:19] <shinigami40297> Warlock has the best horizontal distance but the worst vertical
[1:56:20] <+allups> think the game is kinda bad tbh mate LUL
[1:56:22] <+jordanstayshome> it's not great but it's the best one
[1:56:32] <+mrcooperblack> i know i sound super condescending by saying this but reloading sturm & drang manually is lava
[1:56:32] <%SlashHabit> So how do you boost up mid air with warlock? Because if Pat was a titan or hunter he would have survived
[1:56:33] <+Pyroclase> The thing about glides is that they have technicalyl unlimited horizontal distance, unlike hunter or titan jumps
[1:56:35] <nademonkey1100> titans cant platform for shit though
[1:56:42] <almostkicking> honestly i dont even feel the difference
[1:56:44] <%Kashi_Nin> what @shinigami40297 said is the best way to describe it
[1:56:44] <+Ryan1016> You can skate with swords and objects you pick up like crazy with warlocks for super fast speed
[1:56:44] <+Pyroclase> Also titan jumps are the best
[1:56:47] <MasterDecoder> @SlashHabit You don't
[1:56:47] <$valriot> You can kind of air skate using your burst glide, it you tap n release
[1:56:53] <+JayBo_Vizard> my fist monster disagrees
[1:57:01] <%SlashHabit> @MasterDecoder exactly the jump ability sucks with warlock
[1:57:24] <KaliasTV> I think he forgot about his quest
[1:57:26] <coldsama> I have 300+ hours with my Warlock and I'm falling to my death often cause of some bumps before the place I'm supposed to jump from
[1:57:54] <SpaceCatStation> warlocks just be like that sometimes
[1:57:57] <%some_sunflowers> Pat, why are you using a small baby gun and not a big strong gun?
[1:58:03] <redapache> can someone explain to me what this gamemode is about I just got here
[1:58:12] <+JayBo_Vizard> it depends on use, Hunter high jump is the best PVP jump
[1:58:13] <%dekkitout> Baby gun makes Big Strong gun even stronger
[1:58:36] <dan_g_v> hey chat people. when does minh and reggie show up for this weeks podcast?
[1:58:36] <%dekkitout> They're the Death Stranding guns, but with much less pissing on mushrooms
[1:58:40] <+MisterCrimson> man, Pat's gonna be pissed when he realizes he picked up Prime bounties
[1:58:51] <%some_sunflowers> This gun takes up less screen space than other guns, so I assume it must be worse.
[1:58:58] <%President_Miyazaki> Oh, he started using the Drang while I was gone too. Nice.
[1:59:12] <coldsama> @redapache Kill mobs, get motes, bank motes to summon bossfight, the two teams can invade each other to slow down the progression or heal the enemy boss
[1:59:20] <$afronooch> yeah gambit bounties drop randomly
[1:59:33] <greynob> is this pvp?
[1:59:35] <SpaceCatStation> wait what the heck you guys are steamrolling them right now
[1:59:44] <%dekkitout> This is a pvp, yes
[1:59:44] <ButtDickus> @greynob partly
[1:59:45] <$afronooch> @greynob PvEvP
[1:59:50] <%Zamorouskiwhich> The Lupus finally snuck up on Paige and got her
[1:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[2:00:17] <%XxPatchworkxX> quick Pat. hydrate now or you might do the opposite of that
[2:00:19] <+8bitbandito> is a pve race against another team
[2:00:20] <+d00msdaydan> The dark souls of destiny
[2:00:24] <ButtDickus> not at all @wookie5358
[2:00:29] <+mrcooperblack> they were so proud of it that they made an entire season based around it
[2:00:31] <shadowsofpain> @teramercier Yup the best
[2:00:34] <+Takuatt> Bungie know how to do Firefight
[2:00:35] <FennecZephyr> I actually hate gambit because it puts too much pressure on me to do good, but yeah
[2:00:37] <FennecZephyr> It's alright
[2:00:41] <DFireCreations> BvEvPvIvS
[2:00:42] <dan_g_v> pat still wants ti remove the mlist
[2:00:43] <cronicconquest> MMORPG MODE
[2:00:46] <+gatoralus> gambit is great i just think that its super hard to balance certain weapons in it
[2:00:50] <dan_g_v> moisture even
[2:00:50] <%Zamorouskiwhich> That guy yeeting off the edge LUL
[2:00:51] <%DedlokPM> PvPvE, which no one else has done before that one game at Gamescome. Except this. And that Predator game that was also at gamescom
[2:01:01] <%DedlokPM> But no one else before that one. teenJOY
[2:01:04] <redapache> is that pistol just a Luger?
[2:01:16] <+Pyroclase> It's a german-themed gun yeah
[2:01:24] <+Pyroclase> Sturm and Drang are german for Storm and Stress
[2:01:35] <redapache> huh that's cool
[2:01:36] <+Pyroclase> It's a literature allusion because Destiny is a nerd game
[2:01:45] <%ArcanumMBD> the enemy team is my typical Gambit team. People rushing to grab motes and then dying to regular enemies before banking them
[2:02:03] <%SlashHabit> Pat you have to check out the witcher 3 on switch. Pretty amazing
[2:02:05] <+Pyroclase> NICE pat

[2:05:20] <redapache> PogChamp
[2:05:21] <%dekkitout> I forget how this game throws achievements at you
[2:05:21] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I would use that Apoc helmet just for the heavy finder
[2:05:24] <%TeraMercier> is that a legit question mothman?
[2:05:31] <+valkuma> oh hey its budget warframe
[2:05:36] <%CuddlyZombie> My stream froze who won the round
[2:05:38] <dredshift> When's this going free to play?
[2:05:40] <+Zxtole> He's trying to shill for you
[2:05:41] <%TeraMercier> amazon prime gives you a monthly twitch sub
[2:05:42] <shadowsofpain> Pat considering your using a sidearm you should use the other node on that helm
[2:05:42] <%President_Miyazaki> So, how's it feel now that you know how Gambit works?
[2:05:46] <coldsama> Pat won
[2:05:51] <%CuddlyZombie> Woo
[2:05:52] <$Mothman742> @teramercier no just a free shill

[2:06:58] <$Mothman742> when is fuggins gonna come in and grind with u?
[2:07:00] <almostkicking> am i gonna meet you at gamescom pat? :P
[2:07:02] <+gatoralus> the game is in a good spot and the grind is fun
[2:07:03] <xlovelykay_> Looks like a good time then
[2:07:03] <+jordanstayshome> yay
[2:07:03] <+MisterCrimson> woah, when's the podcast? Tomorrow?
[2:07:06] <shadowsofpain> Pat the helmet your using has a sidearm targeting perk on it. so why not use that instead of the Fusion rifle perk for a type of gun you dont use
[2:07:07] <%Segartner> @AngriestPat are you gonna stream shadowkeep?
[2:07:17] <%TeraMercier> @MisterCrimson later today woolie is streaming from japan
[2:07:19] <Gigigear21 > @dekkitout don't think that works anymore
[2:07:22] <%dekkitout> *Cut to next week* "So I did some grinding off screen...."
[2:07:23] <%Ranryu692> oh, did this replace the DS2 stream? lol
[2:07:24] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Having all three of you grinding Strikes or Nightfalls would be fun :)
[2:07:28] <+Takuatt> As someone who doesn't watch your FFXIV please do. I may not know the numbers but I know how bang bang go
[2:07:28] <%blankwaffle> as someone who doesnt like this game im enjoying watching you play it
[2:07:33] <SpaceCatStation> yessss
[2:07:33] <%squidking96> @angriestpat hey i got back in the other day. not having played since launch with a max character. any tips?
[2:07:34] <+Ryan1016> Muscle PogChamp
[2:07:42] <+informedotaku> have you considered going bavk to Destiny 1 ?
[2:07:45] <shadowsofpain> your welcome buddy
[2:07:49] <%XxPatchworkxX> @d00msdaydan thanks for the reminder @TeraMercier warzone was the mode
[2:07:51] <%dekkitout> The Cabal are thicc from strength
[2:07:58] <%aishman> @AngriestPat By the by dude, thank you for introducing me to Outer Wilds, that game is fucking WILD
[2:08:09] <+JayBo_Vizard> that was something Luke Smith mentioned in his report
[2:08:10] <+Ryan1016> They'll probably have armor drop from gambit then
[2:08:11] <%Segartner> noooot gonna happen
[2:08:11] <%TeraMercier> This game is fun to watch, but I don't think I'd enjoy the gear and gameplay style of this if I were playing it myself
[2:08:13] <%dekkitout> That would be much preferable
[2:08:16] <+jordanstayshome> they'd have to make reconning not terrible
[2:08:17] <%President_Miyazaki> It'll probably be a small quest reward or something
[2:08:23] <+mrcooperblack> they'll make it a higher rate for certain weapons for sure
[2:08:23] <%President_Miyazaki> Like go kill X taken to get it.
[2:08:24] <%TeraMercier> Thanks Patchwork! That's cool to know
[2:08:26] <pmtriox> ew, gold gun
[2:08:38] <KaliasTV> I think there's a 0% change they keep normal Gambit
[2:08:41] <%President_Miyazaki> How dare you mock Drang
[2:08:42] <KaliasTV> *chance
[2:08:47] <+Pyroclase> Love this map
[2:08:57] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I doubt it would be. There is an entire game mode (Reckoning) that is specifically made for getting that armor.
[2:09:00] <%TeraMercier> damn if the other team is good pat will actually have to try
[2:09:38] <$Mothman742> is anyone else havin trouble unlockin the dark age arsenal triumph?
[2:09:53] <@thenefftw> thenefftw subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! It's been a while since I last resubbed, but hey, 9 months. It's nice to see you getting into Destiny 2. I'm happy things seem to be shaping up well for Bungie. Now we just need faction stuff back in the game. I need new FWC armor to wear.
[2:09:55] <+gatoralus> i hope they take a good look at prime and reckoning and just make (mainly reckoning) them better
[2:09:55] <startstoprepeat> see, captains are way more annoying than knights
[2:10:00] <%dekkitout> Is that triumph for playing with a full Gambit set?
[2:10:01] <Brofarian> I am so behind on Destiny story/lore, the Taken are back AGAIN?
[2:10:17] <SpaceCatStation> nah they just never left
[2:10:18] <%JohnnyTubesocks> JohnnyTubesocks subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Pat watch out for that guy behind you!
[2:10:20] <redapache> hey @angriestpat what do I type to search the story about what happened between Bungie and Activision that led up to the Bungie cutting ties with Acti, I wanna know about the conflict in design internally
[2:10:20] <%President_Miyazaki> You helped
[2:10:27] <ChloroShepard> taken gotta take
[2:10:28] <%dekkitout> Someone else is controlling the Taken now cause you didn't when you killed Oryx
[2:10:32] <$Mothman742> @dekkitout nah all gambit weapons and win a gambit matfh
[2:10:37] <$Mothman742> match
[2:10:44] <+JayBo_Vizard> @brofarian they're being controlled by oryx's sisters savathun, in this case we're pulling them from the ascendant realm with this machine he keeps putting garbage in
[2:10:44] <coldsama> You'll soon understand that no one gives a shit about the blockers on your side in Gambit, that's why the Sentry role exist
[2:10:52] <%dekkitout> I swap gear when I know the match is a win
[2:11:04] <Brofarian> I see, cool
[2:11:06] <%TeraMercier> @redapache activision bungie internal tension separation that'll find you some articles
[2:11:33] <+informedotaku> lore\ story just excuse to shooty bang bang
[2:11:34] <%XxPatchworkxX> oh shit that is big boy
[2:11:38] <redapache> @teramercier k thanks
[2:12:02] <%TeraMercier> My biggest problem with this and D1 when I played them is simply that I don't like that grenades are on a cooldown.
[2:12:10] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Another one
[2:12:28] <%Ranryu692> Sony bought Insomniac
[2:12:41] <KaliasTV> He's dead
[2:12:43] <SpaceCatStation> invader is dead
[2:12:46] <ChloroShepard> he's dead
[2:12:47] <%ArcanumMBD> hes dead pat
[2:12:49] <%dekkitout> He's dead, Jim
[2:12:50] <%TeraMercier> le muerte
[2:12:55] <%ArcanumMBD> pat wasting so much time
[2:12:56] <SpaceCatStation> drifter announces when invades die
[2:12:56] <+informedotaku> get armor that reduces grenade cooldown
[2:12:56] <jimhalla> your ally neutralized an invader
[2:12:59] <dmac63> Pat deaf
[2:13:12] <%XxPatchworkxX> yea friend time
[2:13:20] <Brofarian> How can grenades be on a cooldown? Are we supposed to believe these are some sort of MAGIC grenades? I hope someone got fired for that one.
[2:13:23] <ChloroShepard> traded!
[2:13:34] <%Zamorouskiwhich> One is better than none ruuEh
[2:13:35] <%dekkitout> Because the grenades are space magic
[2:13:35] <+Pyroclase> No but they're literally magic grenades
[2:13:38] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Narrator called you out for using a pistol
[2:13:38] <+Pyroclase> you summon them with space magic
[2:13:39] <gluemanofficial> This voiceover sounds like it was recorded for a universal studios theme park ride
[2:13:55] <%TeraMercier> Y'know what, if I think about it more like summoning a grenade like a summon sword or whatever I like it more
[2:14:01] <%Piemen99> He did it
[2:14:05] <+Pyroclase> SUMMON GRENADES
[2:14:08] <SpaceCatStation> yeah! and why do we only get to punch really hard once every few minutes? I punch really hard all the time in real life!
[2:14:14] <%dekkitout> You do realize you're playing as a semi immortal, causality independent zombie right
[2:14:25] <Brofarian> If you could summon them as frequently as summon swords that'd be hype
[2:14:28] <%Zamorouskiwhich> The bond looks great PogChamp
[2:14:43] <SpaceCatStation> yes
[2:14:49] <%Piemen99> yes
[2:14:49] <ChloroShepard> yes
[2:14:51] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah you do
[2:14:54] <%TeraMercier> It's really just that I prefer not to be left hanging when there's enemies clumped together
[2:14:56] <%XxPatchworkxX> Warlocks get some pretty cool gear after D1 year 1
[2:15:04] <%XxPatchworkxX> the trend continues
[2:15:18] <KaliasTV> You'll get a powerful drop for I think winning this match
[2:15:19] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there's a new version of the drang from the menagerie that can roll year 2 stuff
[2:15:22] <redapache> with what other games would it be cool to add player invasions? I always thought it would've been to have player invasions in Metal Gear Solid 5, not only invade your base but another player's mission in Afghanistan
[2:15:39] <%laniacs0472> laniacs0472 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:15:46] <dredshift> How much does this game burden you with garbage loot? The thing I hate about loot shooters the most is how 90% of drops are worthless.
[2:15:46] <redapache> would've been cool*
[2:15:54] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatCaw
[2:15:59] <%dekkitout> Wasn't Warframe gonna have Player as Stalker invasions?
[2:16:07] <Brofarian> Honestly MGS5 invasions would have been way better if it was in the open world instead of at your base
[2:16:10] <+Pyroclase> @dredshift It's one of those things where pretty much any gun is useful
[2:16:17] <gluemanofficial> Winning is the easy part. Dressing up right is the real challenge
[2:16:22] <%TeraMercier> @redapache That's an interesing idea, it would have been cool for the updates that added anti infil options to work in sp.
[2:16:43] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think the sweet spot on the shields take more damage from kinetic, but it's been a while
[2:16:45] <blink289> Did you see that demogorgon is going to be in dead by daylight?
[2:16:49] <%President_Miyazaki> Remember Pat, Handcannon is what you're here for.
[2:16:58] <Brofarian> Invasions in DMC would be great, just because pvp character action would be interesting
[2:17:00] <RepMetal18> You can cancel the super and save energy if you press the super button again. @AngriestPat
[2:17:18] <%TeraMercier> @redapache Though I feel like the meta that would have developed is just getting a big sniper rifle and just waiting in a good position outside the base
[2:17:18] <coldsama> @dredshift any gear below blue rarity is gone at max level and blue gear is here just in case you need some guns but mostly to get materials out of it, it's not Borderlands where you still drops white loot at level 80
[2:17:31] <%furiousfurioso> what class is Pat?
[2:17:35] <Brofarian> You're playing as V and suddenly a Dante shows up out of no where and styles on you
[2:17:47] <redapache> @brofarian so just have a Vergil pop on at anytime, that would make for some exhilarating moments to remember
[2:17:49] <KaliasTV> He's playing middle tree arc warlock
[2:18:05] <$Mothman742> man i wish anarchy reigns got a hd remaster, that shit was fun af
[2:18:34] <Brofarian> @redapache exactly, "Foolishness BluntRider420xXx, foolishness!"
[2:18:56] <+AllAccordingToPlan> pvping on pc with a controller seems like a bad idea
[2:19:12] <redapache> @teramercier yeah that map terrain wasn't really made for PvP so they would've needed to revamp a lot
[2:19:15] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Why does Pats Heavy Ammo Finder work but not mine? ruuCry
[2:19:18] <%XxPatchworkxX> Pats been killing it with a controller this session
[2:19:21] <+angel949> its honestly fine
[2:19:33] <Brofarian> Pat has transcended beyond control schemes
[2:19:39] <+drewdrew89> does he have a red bull fridge
[2:19:39] <%dekkitout> Mind you, he's also using a hand held flak cannon
[2:19:51] <%XxPatchworkxX> Pat is the control scheme
[2:19:59] <Brofarian> Pat is scheme
[2:20:05] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Destiny has pretty solid controller settings/aim assist so its not even that bad
[2:20:14] <SpaceCatStation> nice
[2:20:17] <%Piemen99> did someone show pat the ropes or is he doing it himself
[2:20:25] <%Piemen99> ay meatball
[2:20:26] <%President_Miyazaki> Oh hey, you got the guy.
[2:20:27] <%Zamorouskiwhich> PogChamp Meatball again
[2:20:27] <BlueSpartan119> Ooooo
[2:20:29] <$Mothman742> MEATBALL
[2:20:30] <%Segartner> MEATBALL
[2:20:30] <SpaceCatStation> he's just going
[2:20:30] <%President_Miyazaki> Better hope you win.
[2:20:31] <%dekkitout> Thicc booooi!
[2:20:33] <%DedlokPM> This announcer guy makes me think of that crazy drug dealer guy from D4 Dark Dreams Don't Die
[2:20:34] <%onlystrykerfan> onlystrykerfan subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hello
[2:20:37] <Sullry> MEATBALL
[2:20:39] <sirrice77> meatball meatball spaghetti underneath
[2:20:43] <Brofarian> Paige is actually playing off camera, his controller isn't plugged in
[2:20:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Yes
[2:20:46] <%Piemen99> ye
[2:20:46] <+gatoralus> destiny really isn't that complicated just play you'
[2:20:47] <%dekkitout> Yep
[2:20:48] <SpaceCatStation> you get an exotic hand cannon quest
[2:20:49] <%Segartner> YES KILL IT
[2:20:53] <+gatoralus> you'll be fine
[2:20:55] <Ner234> Question to experienced Destiny player: If I like Borderlands would I like Destiny? Or are there things about Destiny that would turn me away?
[2:20:57] <+Pyroclase> It's meatball because it's a ball of meat
[2:20:59] <%Piemen99> cause it's round
[2:20:59] <Sullry> MALFEASANCE
[2:21:00] <RepMetal18> spaghetti underneath!
[2:21:00] <%XxPatchworkxX> snipers
[2:21:01] <%President_Miyazaki> I mean, he looks like a meatball.
[2:21:01] <%Segartner> it looks like a meatball
[2:21:02] <%dekkitout> Because üåà lore ‚ú®
[2:21:02] <%Piemen99> kill
[2:21:04] <%President_Miyazaki> Need to kill.
[2:21:04] <+mrcooperblack> your team has to kill it
[2:21:06] <%DedlokPM> because it is round and has meat
[2:21:06] <%President_Miyazaki> Must win.
[2:21:06] <+Ryan1016> If you win you get the quest
[2:21:07] <+Pyroclase> everytone on your team gets it if you kill it
[2:21:07] <BlueSpartan119> your team has to win the round
[2:21:07] <+alphonseisbest> !uptime
[2:21:07] <SpaceCatStation> just gotta win the round
[2:21:07] <%dekkitout> Kill it
[2:21:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:08] <startstoprepeat> you gotta win
[2:21:09] <derekwst3> its clearly a meat ball?
[2:21:09] <%Segartner> just win
[2:21:09] <Sullry> Servitor
[2:21:09] <Gigigear21 > kill
[2:21:11] <%25RPM> you have to win
[2:21:11] <+angel949> kill
[2:21:11] <%Zamorouskiwhich> You need to win the round when it spawns
[2:21:12] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you have win with that primevil
[2:21:12] <shinigami40297> Team has to win
[2:21:12] <$Mothman742> meatball or prolapsed anus
[2:21:15] <Sullry> Kill it win the round
[2:21:18] <haveswordmuststing> Kakodemon, derived from the word Kaka, meaning poop
[2:21:19] <%Bailey__gaming> Your team must kill it
[2:21:22] <+Ryan1016> RNG
[2:21:22] <+informedotaku> try hard time
[2:21:22] <%President_Miyazaki> Because RNG
[2:21:23] <$Timesteel> meatball gives you the malfeasence quest
[2:21:24] <gluemanofficial> meatball or rosebud
[2:21:24] <SpaceCatStation> random chance
[2:21:25] <BlueSpartan119> % chance to spawn
[2:21:25] <+Straylightgg> RNG
[2:21:26] <derekwst3> why not
[2:21:27] <BigBrandon907> I BELIEVE PAT
[2:21:29] <%Piemen99> Is it curse week?
[2:21:29] <@thenefftw> RNG
[2:21:30] <%Bailey__gaming> its random
[2:21:31] <Sullry> Random
[2:21:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat he only shows up on a certain week of the dreaming city cycle
[2:21:33] <%king_wragles> Man, this looks hard if you're not a titan Kappa
[2:21:34] <possumwalsh1221> Enemies are rng
[2:21:35] <+gatoralus> @AngriestPat it gives you an exotic handcannon quest and its random chance to spawn him
[2:21:35] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Random, but happens more during a certain weekly rotation, which i THINK is this week...?
[2:21:36] <%Segartner> it's random
[2:21:36] <%dekkitout> It's a random occurrence/lore reasons
[2:21:41] <Sullry> Used to be curse related
[2:21:41] <RepMetal18> Yes pat. Kill it for an exotic quest. @AngriestPat
[2:21:46] <$valriot> @angriestpat Rare spawn for Exotic quest, but the appearance rate has gone up significantly
[2:21:49] <SpaceCatStation> @Piemen99 nah it just shows up now. pretty frequently, too
[2:21:51] <+Ryan1016> Truth LUL
[2:21:51] <@thenefftw> And to make it so getting the quest for Malfeasence isn't a "wait three week" pain
[2:21:56] <%President_Miyazaki> I feel like he isn't getting a quest today.
[2:21:56] <%Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat you have 7 rockets
[2:21:57] <+informedotaku> rng enemy, guarantee drop
[2:22:00] <%dekkitout> In lore, the meatball used to show up when a 3 week cycling cure was at its peak
[2:22:03] <derekwst3> just ate some ramen, was yum
[2:22:04] <%25RPM> invade
[2:22:05] <+informedotaku> WIN
[2:22:07] <+AllAccordingToPlan> @Ner234 destiny 2's loot is very boring compared to bl2, like even the randomly generated stuff is just less recoil or more range or etc, but on the flipside d2 has competitive gameplay and is more of an mmo
[2:22:10] <%Segartner> That guy just hit you with the truth! some straight facts!
[2:22:27] <+informedotaku> kill!
[2:22:31] <%dekkitout> Teleported
[2:22:39] <+informedotaku> you can save the team
[2:22:42] <%DedlokPM> Baited
[2:22:42] <Ner234> @AllAccordingToPlan I see. Thanks.
[2:22:44] <%Yadogari> Just get the other ones LUL
[2:22:45] <+Pyroclase> RIP PAt
[2:22:46] <BakerBrute> F
[2:22:47] <%President_Miyazaki> RIP.
[2:22:48] <%PinkSuprende> Mad baited
[2:22:51] <%President_Miyazaki> No exotic quest for you.
[2:22:52] <+informedotaku> dang next time
[2:22:52] <+Pyroclase> It's okay, the gun sucks
[2:22:56] <IndoorSitup> WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
[2:22:56] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Happens, don't worry ruuEh
[2:22:58] <%Piemen99> You tried and that all that matters
[2:22:58] <%President_Miyazaki> But hey, other than that last one you did good.
[2:23:03] <%king_wragles> @Michael_Erazo Pat was no match for COWARDICE
[2:23:06] <possumwalsh1221> Here‚Äôs where the gambit salt starts
[2:23:12] <shadowsofpain> damn. Lmg's might be better for that
[2:23:15] <@thenefftw> It should still be here
[2:23:21] <+informedotaku> @king_wragles fair enough
[2:23:28] <+gatoralus> the biggest appeal of destiny for me has always been the gameplay. its fantastic. the loot and "rpg" systems are fine
[2:23:33] <%XxPatchworkxX> I can see this mode causing some controller breaks
[2:23:51] <redapache> give it up for Pat doing the best he can with some pogs
[2:23:57] <redapache> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:23:57] <%Puhff> I have no idea what's going on
[2:24:10] <%Gray_skies1993> @gatoralus I 100% agree
[2:24:10] <+maku_tree> pc?
[2:24:12] <pennykettle_> my disappointment when I tried the game was the shallow abilities. the branches of each class are practically identical
[2:24:12] <shadowsofpain> take that aggression and kill the other team
[2:24:13] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Driftor counts Pixels LUL
[2:24:19] <Ion_Laser> @maku_tree it's pc
[2:24:20] <+informedotaku> I like the term blueberries when play with randoms
[2:24:25] <%dekkitout> Gambit was at its most cesspool-est when Sleeper Simulant and Queensbreaker were rather...strong...
[2:24:26] <shadowsofpain> use crazy talk to sour their drops
[2:24:33] <+Pyroclase> They can always be healed
[2:24:34] <+blueface_yea_ight> Hello, teamers :)
[2:24:34] <+maku_tree> does this game have aim assist with controller on pc
[2:24:36] <+Ryan1016> No they can
[2:24:43] <KaliasTV> They can still get healed to full
[2:24:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> @AngriestPat Use your super a lot, it recharges fast
[2:24:45] <Ion_Laser> @maku_tree yeah
[2:24:47] <+AllAccordingToPlan> @AngriestPat wait to dump your stuff for the primeval slayer stacks to build up
[2:24:49] <%king_wragles> Look at that sponge
[2:24:53] <+Pigg1yJuffs> If Pat thinks this is bad, he should've been around when everyone was kitting up with Sleeper Simulants. I have never seen as much rage as those days.
[2:24:53] <+Ryan1016> Heavy
[2:24:54] <%TeraMercier> That super has a really satisfying sound effect
[2:24:57] <+maku_tree> huh
[2:25:12] <redapache> PogChamp
[2:25:25] <Sullry> You should try gambit prime next
[2:25:31] <shadowsofpain> Destiny sound design has always been perfect
[2:25:31] <Animorphimagi> Does Pat know he missed the gamescom first night stream?
[2:25:39] <startstoprepeat> so if you're liking gambit, i'd heavily recommend picking up the exotic izanagi's burden, it makes you very popular
[2:25:47] <%king_wragles> @Animorphimagi I think he knows and doesn't much care
[2:25:52] <haveswordmuststing> @animorphimagi i mean, he missed a whole lot of nothing
[2:25:57] <Sullry> Aight
[2:25:59] <%dekkitout> Why Izanagi when Borealis tajC
[2:25:59] <%DedlokPM> @Animorphimagi considering he tweeted about it on twitter, yes
[2:26:10] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Is Borealis good now@
[2:26:14] <+Pigg1yJuffs> *?
[2:26:15] <$afronooch> no
[2:26:22] <IndoorSitup> whomstve?
[2:26:25] <+Ryan1016> Who?
[2:26:25] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I didn't think so.
[2:26:28] <%dekkitout> Well, break a shield can yield a body shot so...
[2:26:31] <%TeraMercier> God, it would be a ride to watch Paige play Homecoming
[2:26:37] <keiji_maede> Destiny is slowly becoming like Warframe.... Soon the guns are going to have mobs
[2:26:37] <+informedotaku> future war cult fwc
[2:26:40] <+Pyroclase> yes
[2:26:41] <@thenefftw> FWC armor
[2:26:42] <%Piemen99> that can happen
[2:26:43] <+Pyroclase> this is a game in progress
[2:26:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Are
[2:26:45] <@thenefftw> I need it
[2:26:45] <+Fynale> that can happen yes
[2:26:48] <+informedotaku> dead orbit all the way for me
[2:26:48] <+Ryan1016> Yeah it just started though
[2:26:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Are they ever going to bring back factions I wonder
[2:27:00] <%dekkitout> Faction armor will never return~ apatMenace
[2:27:04] <@thenefftw> I still love their shotgun from Osiris
[2:27:10] <+informedotaku> crazy talk activate
[2:27:13] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I miss faction stuff.
[2:27:27] <keiji_maede> Warlocks are..... Soft! Just like Pat
[2:27:38] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Warlocks were once gods
[2:27:39] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, those nerds like me, Nef, and Absolute.
[2:27:40] <+Pyroclase> Pay go get 1k voices it's super easy to get you omnly need to do l;ike 60 raids
[2:27:44] <shadowsofpain> @thenefftw Oh yeah the Perfect Paradox was the best for a solid year
[2:27:48] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Everyone conspired to bring them low.
[2:27:49] <+Pyroclase> jesus I cannot type
[2:27:55] <@thenefftw> I meant the FWC shotgun
[2:27:57] <%ArcanumMBD> just do multiple year's worth of content in a few days Pat, simple
[2:28:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Just get something that feels good to you
[2:28:01] <+informedotaku> yeah but you could make progress without knowing if you just pick them up
[2:28:04] <IndoorSitup> Our non Discorders' opiniobs do not matter.
[2:28:04] <keiji_maede> xD
[2:28:04] <%GarbageNirvana> If something feels better, use that
[2:28:11] <IndoorSitup> opinions
[2:28:13] <shadowsofpain> oh fuck I forgot that one
[2:28:13] <keiji_maede> Pat doing PvP things
[2:28:21] <shadowsofpain> eh, it was ok
[2:28:34] <%GarbageNirvana> I got an auto rifle that I masterworked cause it has firefly and bonus kinetic damage on shield breaks
[2:28:35] <coldsama> Gambit theme is the best theme in the game I wish it could play while you're on the last round after each team won a round
[2:28:39] <redapache> that's easy pat, just buy the jump potion and get all the guns that'll work
[2:28:54] <+Ryan1016> Zavala, drifter, shaxx are most stuff like that
[2:28:55] <%GarbageNirvana> And I got that shit from a forge run
[2:28:58] <%TeraMercier> TeraMercier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[2:29:11] <shadowsofpain> I remember running Zetith and perfect paradox, but then the Ikelos came and I never looked back
[2:29:14] <%President_Miyazaki> And while you continue to grind this I'm gonna grind some Granblue.
[2:29:24] <@thenefftw> Does everyone want to know my crazy choice?
[2:29:40] <%pilgrimsayswhat> NICE

[2:31:42] <+Ryan1016> Pat heavy does significantly more dmg than you're primaries and you got 7 nade launcher shots
[2:31:53] <%pilgrimsayswhat> pog
[2:31:56] <+Ryan1016> Ayyy
[2:31:57] <%Gray_skies1993> puccaWin
[2:31:57] <ChloroShepard> ayyyy
[2:32:02] <%Nobrev> time for me to see if I can start the seasonal event now and still get the full armor set. wish me luck
[2:32:03] <Ion_Laser> YEET
[2:32:09] <redapache> SeemsGood
[2:32:12] <+alphonseisbest> say since pat is playing schlooter game, anyone know if its still possible to reach rank 30 in nightwave?
[2:32:17] <shadowsofpain> also heavy resets between rounds so unload
[2:32:17] <%Gray_skies1993> good luck friend @Nobrev
[2:32:20] <+Nomicro4u> sword envy
[2:32:21] <+Pyroclase> that sword shoots energy slashes, it's awesome
[2:32:22] <+Yosepmeist> All my friends hate Gambit but I think it's pretty fun pizzap1Cry
[2:32:23] <$shurtal> Fall War SWORD
[2:32:24] <%heyitsbrian> I just had this on in the background, and was very confused for a sec
[2:32:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Dassa good sword
[2:32:28] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @alphonseisbest I hope so
[2:32:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I'm at 19
[2:32:41] <%dekkitout> Virgin Black Talon, Chad Boltcaster
[2:32:56] <KaliasTV> From 19? Yes, from 0? Probably not
[2:33:09] <KaliasTV> Depends how long they extend the end
[2:33:12] <%Unlimited_> Unlimited_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! If my sub to you lapses for a few months, just know I'm in a trash world of wow until lvl 60. Also pet the baby and give paige a big hug for me.
[2:33:27] <+carp_> If you aren't gonna invade don't be the guy who takes power ammo first
[2:33:35] <%TeraMercier> When am I gonna get a shooter that resumes your interrupted reload animation from an intuitive point like grabbing a mag o racking the bolt
[2:33:41] <shadowsofpain> isnt Iron Banner soon? I think with a few more lucky weapon drops Pat might be swimming in wins
[2:33:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Pat been invading tho
[2:34:03] <+carp_> not with sturm and drag and a grenade launcher he fucking isnt
[2:34:06] <IndoorSitup> @teramercier Titanfall 1 and 2 did that IIRC.
[2:34:09] <BigBrandon907> Battlefield 5 does that @teramercier
[2:34:10] <+alphonseisbest> @kaliastv hmm thanks, so not really worth investing in then if r1. got it!
[2:34:11] <+carp_> oh my god
[2:34:13] <KaliasTV> @shadowsofpain next iron banner on the 27th
[2:34:26] <%dekkitout> @carp_ Now you say that but you must've tuned in, fiend...
[2:34:30] <%TeraMercier> That's rad, thanks ya'll. Titanfall is the best and maybe ill look at BFV
[2:34:31] <%dekkitout> *Friend
[2:34:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> 2 aint bad
[2:34:37] <shadowsofpain> I could have sworn it was next week lol
[2:34:44] <%Ranryu692> this is the most edgelordiest dialogue
[2:34:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> AGAIN
[2:34:54] <SpaceCatStation> they both had motes so that's a win LUL
[2:34:54] <%pilgrimsayswhat> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:34:57] <%Piemen99> DO IT
[2:34:59] <coldsama> 2 and a Arrow wasted is good
[2:35:02] <IndoorSitup> ANOTHER ONE
[2:35:02] <%king_wragles> He's charing his lazer!
[2:35:07] <%dekkitout> Embrace the Darkness, Sora
[2:35:09] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Awwwwwwwwwwww
[2:35:20] <%Gray_skies1993> FIRIN MUH LAZAR
[2:35:21] <Zombrocom> Oh wow they even do the black phantom effect, that's shameless
[2:35:21] <shadowsofpain> The Drifter is big Edgelord
[2:35:27] <+Pyroclase> @TeraMercier Destiny 2 actually has a form of reload cancelling as well; the gun counts as reloaded the moment the magazine is in place, not after you pull the bolt
[2:35:29] <%king_wragles> "Good for him" = "THAT RAT BASTARD"
[2:35:50] <RamenRiderZ> Drifter gets mad hype when you wipe the enemy team
[2:35:56] <+burgerdicks> The meep morps?
[2:36:05] <shadowsofpain> "This is how the Taken feel, revel in it"
[2:36:07] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the hex?
[2:36:10] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Someone please tell me Pat has been learning about the lore in this game. If not, everyone scream at him to watch My Name is Byf's videos. There is so much crazy story shit.
[2:36:24] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I get the intent but it'd be nice if it just loaded a mote on you on a kill instead of having to pick it up
[2:36:25] <coldsama> Drifter is hype sometimes
[2:36:26] <IndoorSitup> Really wish there was an option in this game to turn off the announcers or replace them with someone more low key, like the Halo announcer.
[2:36:26] <%TeraMercier> @Pyroclase Seems like it would be a pretty natural thing to therefore not play the bolt racking if there's still a round in the chamber
[2:36:28] <%dekkitout> I'm sure he knows about Destiny's Vaati
[2:36:33] <shadowsofpain> Let him decide if that's what he wants to do
[2:36:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Destiny has some of the coolest lore that the game does everything in its power to keep you from learning
[2:36:37] <BlueSpartan119> MEATBALL
[2:36:38] <SpaceCatStation> MEATBALL
[2:36:39] <%ssjklyco> I'll be back. gotta refuel with monster
[2:36:41] <+Ryan1016> Another chance at the spicy meatball
[2:36:44] <RamenRiderZ> Meatball PogChamp
[2:36:44] <%dekkitout> Thicc boooooi!
[2:36:50] <+Pyroclase> @TeraMercier Yeah, but alas Destiny doesn't do that yet
[2:36:51] <%TeraMercier> This guy reminds me of Mason in Black Ops 4 multiplayer
[2:36:57] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> SPICY MEATBALL
[2:37:00] <shadowsofpain> I'm super into the lore but I play in a clan that couldn't give two shits
[2:37:02] <%Piemen99> meatballl!!!
[2:37:06] <%dekkitout> Is this week a curse week?
[2:37:14] <SpaceCatStation> nah it just appears frequently now
[2:37:37] <IndoorSitup> Destiny's lore is pretty much just Babby's First Science Fiction Novel.
[2:37:43] <coldsama> But he is not appearing in Prime I think
[2:37:47] <+Pyroclase> @IndoorSitup It really, really isn't
[2:37:52] <%President_Miyazaki> Trade is still a win.
[2:37:54] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you got a kill and forced a power weapon use
[2:37:56] <+mrcooperblack> meatball does appear in prime
[2:38:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It's not even that the lore is bad, it's that it's located in all these weird disparate places
[2:38:14] <IndoorSitup> Y'all really need to read more science fictio books.
[2:38:18] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, Strum has a very specific rhythm
[2:38:21] <shadowsofpain> @mrcooperblack Not the meatball but Nokis doea
[2:38:22] <IndoorSitup> fiction
[2:38:50] <+mrcooperblack> pretty sure it does
[2:38:54] <%Piemen99> WIN
[2:38:55] <BlueSpartan119> yeyeyeye
[2:38:55] <SpaceCatStation> yeah!
[2:38:57] <shadowsofpain> Sadly they didnt give Nokris a cool drop
[2:39:01] <RamenRiderZ> Malf time
[2:39:01] <+mrcooperblack> but regardless CONGRATURATION
[2:39:04] <+Pyroclase> SEETHING HEART GET
[2:39:05] <ChloroShepard> you got the heart!
[2:39:09] <%Gray_skies1993> VICTORIOUS!
[2:39:09] <BlueSpartan119> Exotic quest GET
[2:39:13] <%Iccirrus> big malfeasance quest
[2:39:15] <%Iccirrus> yeet
[2:39:15] <@thenefftw> And now you get a new exotic quest
[2:39:17] <KaliasTV> The heart of meat
[2:39:17] <%dekkitout> Woo, mediocre weapon quest!
[2:39:37] <%TubeMan642> Hey Pat a funny thing you should know is that the Ace of Spades quest used t be harder as it would only count hand cannon kills while invading it was changed because a majority of people could not do it
[2:39:38] <@thenefftw> It's a quest
[2:39:45] <shadowsofpain> for a controller user like pat the Malfeasance is good
[2:39:46] <%TeraMercier> Seething head is the only way I go down on anyone
[2:39:52] <IndoorSitup> Man is there an option to shut the announcer up? He's pretty annoying imo
[2:39:53] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> ERF
[2:39:55] <+TreeeFOX> I still cant believe youre playing this game
[2:39:55] <ChloroShepard> i do the same thing lol
[2:39:58] <Tucker0603> maelfesance is ok
[2:40:10] <%Kashi_Nin> Pat ALWAYS gets the seething head
[2:40:11] <+jordanstayshome> malfeasance is the best looking gun in the game
[2:40:16] <nademonkey1100> it TOOK SO LONG
[2:40:17] <Tucker0603> riiiiiight
[2:40:22] <Tucker0603> it sucked man
[2:40:28] <+mrcooperblack> Last hand ornament for ace begs to differ
[2:40:28] <suikudo> i was one step away from malfeasance
[2:40:35] <suikudo> and then they took the quest away from me or something
[2:40:38] <shinigami40297> I did it in 1 match it really wasnt hard people just whined
[2:40:40] <%dekkitout> I thought Ace was Invader kills and kills as Invader
[2:40:42] <SpaceCatStation> Malfeasance is great for Gambit. Otherwise it's just fine.
[2:40:43] <+Fynale> no it was invader kills with handcannons you had to be invaded not the invader
[2:40:45] <+Pigg1yJuffs> You are wrong @jordanstayshome. It's actually Outbreak Perfected.
[2:40:46] <%TubeMan642> I got it befroe they changed it
[2:40:48] <shinigami40297> 10 kills with a hand cannon while invading
[2:40:58] <Chainsaw105> its hand cannon kills AGAINST INVADERS, not while invading
[2:41:02] <startstoprepeat> malfeasance was great for iron burden
[2:41:26] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat and the meta at the time was to use super powerful one shot snipers or fusion rifles and get out so you'd never get in range
[2:41:31] <%dekkitout> I distinctly remember spawn trapping invaders when Forsaken launched to get Ace
[2:41:33] <+mrcooperblack> those gauntlets are good for your loadout specifically
[2:41:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:41:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:42:11] <+Ryan1016> Speak to drifter again
[2:42:12] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> time for Pat to start learning about the man with the golden gun
[2:42:16] <+Ryan1016> He's glowing
[2:42:18] <Asian5Caillou> Destiny ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:42:19] <KaliasTV> @AngriestPat You cancelled handing in the heart
[2:42:21] <startstoprepeat> wait, did seething heart still say talk to the drifter

[2:42:38] <+Ryan1016> It didn't go through for some reason yeah
[2:42:39] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Pat's running Chaos Reach right? Wasn't Tranversive Steps the exotic that he wants?
[2:42:44] <shadowsofpain> you didnt press x
[2:42:51] <IndoorSitup> @gr4ndm4rsh4ll I think you meant The Man With the Golden Eyes.

[2:43:46] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat Seriously, don't worry about that right now. It's for an exotic quest you can't do right now
[2:43:46] <+informedotaku> I thought it was done the game

[2:44:08] <$valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[2:44:09] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's a solo raid
[2:44:09] <SpaceCatStation> PC
[2:44:09] <%Piemen99> pc
[2:44:11] <+Ryan1016> Shit

[2:44:12] <%Iccirrus> basically the Dreaming City is on a 3 week cycle
[2:44:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bugger
[2:44:13] <%Agami23> the geocentric theory pat! @AngriestPat
[2:44:13] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat dreaming city operates on a 3 week cycle of progressively worsening curse, third week has an extra dungeon
[2:44:13] <+primax104> Farq?
[2:44:14] <%cureneckbeard> Baba can't is you
[2:44:14] <Budda37> shattered throne is every 3 weeks
[2:44:15] <%hatesdps> hatesdps subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! woo
[2:44:16] <shadowsofpain> PC with Controller
[2:44:18] <sirrice77> theres a dungeon called shattered throne in dreaming city only available during a certain week in the cycle the dreaming city goes through
[2:44:20] <RamenRiderZ> Shattered Throne is an instance you enter from Dreaming City, available every three weeks
[2:44:20] <@thenefftw> Guys, don't confuse him with this shit
[2:44:22] <HibikiYamada> like telling a level 60 player to do Eureka lmao
[2:44:23] <+mrcooperblack> only striker huh?
[2:44:23] <+bonzosan> One week.
[2:44:26] <%Iccirrus> every 3 weeks there's a 3 man dungeon you can run
[2:44:26] <Sullry> Google
[2:44:29] <derekwst3> there is someone behind you
[2:44:33] <AdmiralButtloaf> Gotta do the sunken wasteland pat
[2:44:33] <%Unlimited_> did pat already read my sub message?
[2:44:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet I could start talking about suoerchargers and it would make as much sense to Pat.
[2:44:37] <mrblack499> what did i miss
[2:44:37] <%cureneckbeard> arm cancer
[2:44:38] <+Fynale> personally if i was with him i'd unlock the black armory to get a hammerhead cuz hammerhead is BROKEN
[2:44:38] <derekwst3> its skellmo
[2:44:40] <%Ranryu692> asks hundreds of people for advice, gets mad when he gets conflicting answers apatWhat
[2:44:41] <artoflec> yeah ive hurt my shoulder pretty bad just sleeping wrong its honestly kind of pathetic
[2:44:42] <coldsama> Shattered Throne is a mission that appears every 3 weeks, it's a unique mission and you should bring people to help you
[2:44:42] <%dekkitout> Shattered Throne is an activity that can be done every 3 weeks, doing it gets you an exotic bow and some stuff for a triumph/seal
[2:44:50] <SpaceCatStation> yes
[2:44:50] <+mrcooperblack> Both
[2:44:50] <OnyxMemory> PvP
[2:44:50] <%Piemen99> Both
[2:44:51] <%President_Miyazaki> Both.
[2:44:51] <sirrice77> both
[2:44:51] <ozuma35> both
[2:44:52] <+Fynale> both
[2:44:53] <nademonkey1100> yes
[2:44:54] <+Pyroclase> Ace of Spades is great for both
[2:44:54] <derekwst3> neither
[2:44:54] <%Iccirrus> primarily pvp, but not bad in pve either
[2:44:55] <$valriot> Both
[2:44:55] <+Ryan1016> Both but better for PvP
[2:44:55] <+Pyroclase> it's godly
[2:44:56] <Tucker0603> both
[2:44:56] <Budda37> both
[2:44:56] <+mrbearhands> BOth
[2:44:57] <shinigami40297> YES
[2:44:59] <+Fynale> if you're good with it it's great
[2:45:00] <shadowsofpain> Both
[2:45:00] <%Segartner> both its a beast
[2:45:01] <%Bailey__gaming> I hope your arm feels better soon
[2:45:03] <Aydarkzero> Both
[2:45:04] <%cureneckbeard> awaiting the railith comic to explain how Pat hurt his arm without noticing
[2:45:05] <wizzerobe93> Both, one of the best guns in the entire game
[2:45:08] <shadowsofpain> Big Yes
[2:45:08] <TangoNango> What emblem is Pat using?
[2:45:08] <%Bailey__gaming> both
[2:45:11] <%Iccirrus> there are just better uses for your exotic slot in PvE, but until you get those it'll carry you
[2:45:18] <%dekkitout> Ace is stacked like a nice plat of pancakes
[2:45:19] <$valriot> Ace is both, Thorn is decent in PvE, Last Word is HARD PvP
[2:45:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> He stole eris shit
[2:45:24] <@thenefftw> Pat, if you want to know what to do with that Awoken Talisman, just ask in the Discord later
[2:45:27] <Veteranhelldiver17> can't wait for him to to infuse his chalice with imperials to get more runes in the meneragie Kappa
[2:45:33] <startstoprepeat> there's an exotic chest piece for the warlock that pairs really well with it, means you get double firefly
[2:45:39] <%Unlimited_> can someone explain why this man flips around the medallion?
[2:45:39] <%Iccirrus> what Nef said
[2:45:41] <@absolute_weapon> Yup, we are always available if you need any help
[2:45:47] <%Agami23> destiny seems to have a problem, because i can say bullshit from fate/ and pat probably cant tell the difference.
[2:45:56] <Aydarkzero> @tangonango it's for playing during laser tag weekend
[2:45:57] <derekwst3> woolievs fire emblem just went up on the youtubes
[2:46:02] <mrblack499> don't think about it lol
[2:46:07] <spaxis_> how's your solstice grind going?
[2:46:07] <Veteranhelldiver17> Waifu wars?
[2:46:08] <+mrbearhands> What is Pat trying to do?
[2:46:12] <scourageriot> destiny is BS. So is Fate. At least Destiny is pretty
[2:46:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> This is Just Rival wings....
[2:46:13] <%Bailey__gaming> @unlimited_ he's an asshole

[2:47:10] <shadowsofpain> I felt that
[2:47:10] <FennecZephyr> BANK AT 5 YA GOBLIN
[2:47:12] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat just jump better
[2:47:13] <%dekkitout> Best thing about Destiny lore is that there's a god damn choose your own adventure in the lore LUL
[2:47:16] <Tucker0603> this map is the FUCKING Worst
[2:47:17] <mrblack499> Just do it
[2:47:17] <Veteranhelldiver17> and now truth
[2:47:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah this ain't my favorite
[2:47:19] <KnightAsteran> pat why don't you have the Solstice gear, it's 700?
[2:47:21] <Veteranhelldiver17> good times
[2:47:25] <+mrcooperblack> kills with one reload the other
[2:47:28] <%President_Miyazaki> Each time you get a kill with one it reloads the other, so yo ujust keep switching.
[2:47:36] <nademonkey1100> strum fills drang drang fills strum
[2:47:41] <%Iccirrus> @KnightAsteran that's too much of a grind for him, it isn't worth it at this point
[2:47:46] <KaliasTV> He got the solstice gear before level 50, so he didn't get it at 700
[2:47:46] <%Iccirrus> there are other things to prioritize
[2:47:46] <Aydarkzero> Synergy Pat!
[2:47:47] <+IllestVillain21> nice just started watching and Pat immediately dies
[2:47:55] <%GarbageNirvana> I've been using the Arbalest in Gambit lately, thing knocks down big boys pretty good
[2:48:05] <%Iccirrus> arbalest is fun
[2:48:09] <%Iccirrus> wish it worked with Match Game
[2:48:09] <KnightAsteran> @kaliastv ah that sucks
[2:48:15] <Veteranhelldiver17> Arbalest is a shieldbuster so...
[2:48:25] <%GarbageNirvana> That it is
[2:48:25] <%dekkitout> @Iccirrus The fact that it doesn't is a dam crime
[2:48:36] <KnightAsteran> I got the arbalest after a random crucible match and I fuckin love it
[2:48:44] <%Iccirrus> Yeah, I saw that and was like "I'm never NOT using that in nightfalls"
[2:48:48] <%Iccirrus> then it just kinda didn't work
[2:48:50] <KnightAsteran> it looks like shit tho
[2:48:50] <%Iccirrus> was big sad
[2:48:55] <coldsama> @garbagenirvana It's the best things to deal with invaders and Captain Blockers,I'm playing Sentry and this is my weapon at all times it's so good in Gambit Prime
[2:49:04] <Tucker0603> the Arbelest is strong as hell, I love it
[2:49:07] <%Iccirrus> I love it, it looks like a jank railgun
[2:49:08] <%Iccirrus> because it is
[2:49:12] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Guess what, it's my birthday!
[2:49:15] <%dekkitout> Between Arbalest and Borealis, I don't know which to lean on
[2:49:15] <+mrbearhands> Dragn reloads Sturm on kills and overcharges the mag with additional high damage bullets, reloading with Sturm is non optimal
[2:49:18] <Veteranhelldiver17> @GarbageNirvana remember when sleeper simulant was rampaging throughout gambit?
[2:49:22] <%QueequegTheater> I got a totaled car this year
[2:49:23] <KnightAsteran> I'm just happy to have a kinetic fusion rifle
[2:49:27] <Tucker0603> @dekkitout Arbelest
[2:49:28] <KnightAsteran> I love fusion rifles
[2:49:32] <scourageriot> JUTUNN
[2:49:33] <OnyxMemory> problem with getting mountaintop recluse is that you never want to use other stuff
[2:49:43] <KnightAsteran> @scourageriot how do I get that?
[2:49:46] <%GarbageNirvana> @Veteranhelldiver17 Oh boy do I
[2:49:47] <$valriot> LUL LUL
[2:49:48] <+mrbearhands> And the ammount of high damage rounds goes caps at 111 rounds in a sungle clip
[2:49:49] <SpaceCatStation> LUL
[2:49:50] <%ssjklyco> Your hands look like they are wrapped in meat
[2:49:50] <Aydarkzero> Lmao
[2:49:50] <%Gray_skies1993> YOUR OWN WEAPON
[2:49:52] <+mrbearhands> single*
[2:49:54] <%Gray_skies1993> USED AGAINST YOU
[2:49:54] <%Piemen99> Almost had him
[2:49:57] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Wait! I just realized! Has Pat done ANY of the invitations of the Nine or visited Cut at all?
[2:49:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> This announcer sounds edgier than Sidurgu
[2:49:59] <Veteranhelldiver17> @scourageriot uh hum it is pronuced J√∂tunn
[2:50:00] <+mrcooperblack> when you're ignoring that thing you know you've gotta do
[2:50:00] <%President_Miyazaki> I know you want the most motes taken but don't let them all just shoot you in the back my dude.
[2:50:01] <%GarbageNirvana> The moment an invader showed up you'd be lucky to see the fucker before you got zapped
[2:50:05] <%dekkitout> See- but I like abusing the various reload systems to extend Borealis' damage buff
[2:50:07] <+Pigg1yJuffs> *Xur
[2:50:20] <%QueequegTheater> S&D so good
[2:50:22] <scourageriot> @KnightAsteran mine dropped when gettng izanagi's burden
[2:50:27] <scourageriot> i think its a random drop at bergusia now
[2:50:35] <Aydarkzero> Pat should in fact do the invitation of the nine
[2:50:37] <Veteranhelldiver17> @GarbageNirvana and the the queenbreak wreaked havoc, by the by it was litterally broken
[2:50:37] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:50:38] <%QueequegTheater> F
[2:50:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> ded
[2:50:46] <KnightAsteran> @king_wolf_rigger living on an ice planet in a dead system with ghosts alla round and being hunted by the man with the golden gun would do that to ya
[2:50:50] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat fun fact the hammer head is a machine gun not a sniper rifle
[2:50:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Thankfully I wasn't playing as much when that was going on
[2:51:05] <Chainsaw105> you can slide through the gravity cannons to launch to the center
[2:51:10] <+Reveresao> NotLikeThis that not the boss
[2:51:10] <%dekkitout> "We noticed a bug where Queensbreaker had more bullet magnetism" or something of the sorts
[2:51:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @KnightAsteran Acceptable reason for edginess. lol
[2:51:20] <%king_wragles> oof
[2:51:24] <+jordanstayshome> don't super the prime until at least three stacks of Slayer show ip
[2:51:27] <Veteranhelldiver17> i was, i will admit that i used it as much as it was used on me
[2:51:29] <BakerBrute> So long gay bowser
[2:51:30] <SirTeabottom> Yote
[2:51:34] <shadowsofpain> God the queenbreaker was so Broken you could shoot a guardians foot and it would somehow net you a headshot
[2:51:56] <Veteranhelldiver17> double the intended aim assist does that
[2:52:01] <KnightAsteran> i still haven't gotten a Queensbreaker since TTK
[2:52:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Holy shit
[2:52:06] <+Fynale> man the hammerhead needs nerfed in pvp
[2:52:06] <%GarbageNirvana> And heeere come the LMGs
[2:52:10] <%Gray_skies1993> well, back to full health NotLikeThis
[2:52:11] <%dekkitout> Hell, you could aim for the sun and kill 4 people on the way
[2:52:14] <Veteranhelldiver17> Hammerhead ugh
[2:52:17] <SpaceCatStation> boy that sure is hammerhead
[2:52:23] <Veteranhelldiver17> i love/hate that gun
[2:52:31] <TheIndigoLlama> Heavy ammo in gambit rubberNotLikeThis
[2:52:33] <+Fynale> guns super fun in pve
[2:52:34] <+Fynale> cancer in pvp
[2:52:36] <scourageriot> loooove hammerhead lol
[2:52:37] <@thenefftw> Hammerhead is great when it's not used on you
[2:52:40] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Well Johny McKillshot has been making sure you guys can't actually hit the prime
[2:52:46] <%titans_ace_jerid> Pat gonna be going much longer?
[2:52:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> lol that dance
[2:52:56] <KnightAsteran> what's hammerhead? a pinnacle LMG?
[2:53:02] <%Ranryu692> crank dat soulja boy
[2:53:04] <@thenefftw> Nope
[2:53:06] <LeftOverPizza13> crank dat soulja boy
[2:53:07] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a forge LMG
[2:53:09] <FennecZephyr> Gambit's a little fucked because the heavy ammo economy somehow needs to be tuned for PvE and PvP at the same time
[2:53:10] <+Fynale> i love that you can emote at each other between rounds
[2:53:10] <%dekkitout> Floss and dab at them
[2:53:12] <Veteranhelldiver17> Every gun is broken, except when i am using it amarite?
[2:53:13] <@thenefftw> You get Hammerhead from forges
[2:53:13] <+Fynale> best part of gambit
[2:53:15] <sirrice77> @KnightAsteran nope its a forge LMG
[2:53:21] <Aydarkzero> Hammerhead is from black armory
[2:53:24] <+Ryan1016> Still a solid hour SeemsGood
[2:53:26] <KnightAsteran> I've just started doing forges
[2:53:29] <derekwst3> pat should summon Exodia
[2:53:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Bout another hour then

[2:53:48] <MasterDecoder> Wasn't Paige suppose to Stream? Did that happen already?
[2:53:49] <%XxPatchworkxX> I love it when Warlocks just jump into the action
[2:53:52] <Veteranhelldiver17> man the forges was a slog and a half
[2:53:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Paige got back from the hospital fairly recently, dunno if she's fully recovered yet
[2:54:00] <derekwst3> @Tucker0603 she was upstairs earlier
[2:54:04] <%Piemen99> Slide into the portal to go to the middle
[2:54:10] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat
[2:54:12] <RamenRiderZ> Volundr on week 1 LUL
[2:54:18] <Aydarkzero> Unlocking those forges for all three characters was the worst
[2:54:22] <Veteranhelldiver17> does pat's nade laucher have spike nades?

[2:54:34] <Tucker0603> wooo
[2:54:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice
[2:54:37] <KnightAsteran> unlocking the forges at BA launch is what made me drop the game
[2:54:40] <+Ryan1016> Next part is strike kills right?
[2:54:42] <%Aeoneth> ayyyy Pat's getting Ace. It's a Real good gun. Enjoy it Pat

[2:55:02] <%dekkitout> With all the weirdness Pat's encountered in Gambit today, I'm surprised he hasn't encountered an Titan who puts Ward on bank
[2:55:09] <mrblack499> how is the grind going

[2:55:54] <%bevyrage> think the plan is to do what that guy just did
[2:55:54] <KnightAsteran> it's an energy fusion rifle rocket launcher
[2:55:57] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Time to go grind Volundr forge Pat. Then maybe you'll get your own Jotunn.
[2:55:57] <+Fynale> man Black Armory lived up to it's name with the stupid strong guns

[2:56:52] <+ThePayphone> is pat playing on console or pc with controller?
[2:56:55] <TheBigTaco> I would probably focus the invader pat

[2:57:18] <+Ryan1016> Jotunn is pronounced Yo Toon
[2:57:19] <%QueequegTheater> @Veteranhelldiver17 I bet Woolie must've been annoying during the God of War LP
[2:57:20] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Piemen99 Juh-tonne
[2:57:25] <Tucker0603> @veteranhelldiver17 hey I can pronounce it right, plus Norse sounds amazing
[2:57:26] <%XxPatchworkxX> so is there any woolie bait in this game?

[3:00:45] <SpaceCatStation> @MasterDecoder I think it was more recently that they upped the encounter chance, but yeah before that I had only seen it twice after months of playing
[3:00:46] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Do you have any special weapons? Like snipers, shotguns and the like?
[3:00:47] <%father_hill> father_hill subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[3:01:10] <FennecZephyr> That's be okay for PvE
[3:01:12] <%QueequegTheater> Pat you have Sturm and Drang
[3:01:14] <Veteranhelldiver17> @AngriestPat trie getting a handcannon called Trust
[3:01:14] <+Ryan1016> Much better than double primary
[3:01:27] <shadowsofpain> In layman numbers, that 500 drang kills and about 200 Strum kills
[3:01:30] <%Segartner> do you have erentil?
[3:01:36] <ozuma35> shame the service revolver is awesome
[3:01:36] <%Bailey__gaming> has he done reckoning?

[3:02:14] <%Iccirrus> it's a 180 w/ricochhet
[3:02:16] <%QueequegTheater> Pat you are literally holding Sturm and Drang
[3:02:16] <%demegodz> Feels great
[3:02:16] <+Pyroclase> not EVERY old gun is bad
[3:02:17] <+mrcooperblack> threat detector is underestimated
[3:02:17] <%Aeoneth> It's preciion and high ROF
[3:02:18] <Aydarkzero> Jack Queen King isn't to bad
[3:02:18] <%Iccirrus> it's decent
[3:02:21] <%totesmcgoat_> Ikelos is good, Jack King Queen is really good too
[3:02:21] <%dekkitout> But it has decent stats
[3:02:22] <%Piemen99> it shoots fast
[3:02:22] <%tweedler92> Old one's fine
[3:02:22] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a better old one
[3:02:25] <+DrN0rd> 1 perk doesnt mean its bad
[3:02:30] <shadowsofpain> the Ikelos is good. good in old perk pool terms
[3:02:31] <%dekkitout> Old =/= bad sometimes
[3:02:32] <Veteranhelldiver17> 180 rounds a minute
[3:02:33] <ozuma35> look at the stats and abilities
[3:02:33] <Sullry> Just because it‚Äôs old doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad
[3:02:35] <startstoprepeat> just because it's old doesn't mean it's bad. some people still rock that stuff.
[3:02:37] <Tucker0603> Pat you can still use old stuff. this is the ace combat stuff all over again
[3:02:39] <%dekkitout> People still use Midnight Coup
[3:02:42] <+mrcooperblack> jack queen king is an ease of use gun
[3:02:43] <ozuma35> plus easy recoil control
[3:02:43] <%Iccirrus> Some old weapons are okay. The main difference between the old and new is perks as far as weapons go
[3:02:45] <RamenRiderZ> Precision Frames are good
[3:02:47] <%Iccirrus> but some old weapons were good
[3:02:48] <startstoprepeat> midnight coup was top tier for months into forsaken.
[3:02:49] <KnightAsteran> I still see Midnight Coups
[3:02:49] <shinigami40297> year 1 weapons arent bad, the best handcannon after spare rations is a year 1 weapon
[3:02:56] <%Aeoneth> It's archetype is what makes it good. It's a 180 which means you shoot the fastest. And it;s a precision type
[3:02:59] <Sullry> Midnight coup is still a really good gun
[3:03:03] <Veteranhelldiver17> some are
[3:03:06] <%Iccirrus> They can't be modded
[3:03:08] <+Pyroclase> They are missing a perk, but that isn't worse than a gunw tih two lame perks
[3:03:09] <%Iccirrus> but that's about it
[3:03:11] <%Tremuto> Tremuto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Someone tell him to get the Not Forgotten HC if it still exists
[3:03:11] <%totesmcgoat_> Don't only look at perks
[3:03:12] <%dekkitout> Some are inferior, but not bad
[3:03:12] <%Aeoneth> It IS missing a perk, but it's frame more than makes up for it
[3:03:12] <ozuma35> missing a mod slot
[3:03:12] <%Iccirrus> some of them are fine
[3:03:13] <Veteranhelldiver17> or masterworked
[3:03:14] <@thenefftw> Nah, old guns can still be good
[3:03:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> Destiny put up a shadowkeep trailer a few hours ago
[3:03:16] <+Pyroclase> or even one good perk and one shit per
[3:03:17] <mr_red117> less perks are better than shit perks
[3:03:18] <%Ninestempest> Some stuff is fine, liek raid weapons
[3:03:20] <+mrcooperblack> they just don't have random rolls and don't get masterworked the same way
[3:03:22] <%totesmcgoat_> Try them out, see how they feel
[3:03:23] <shinigami40297> they are 1 perk less and cant be modded but some are still fine
[3:03:24] <%demegodz> Some old guns still hold their ground
[3:03:24] <FennecZephyr> They are, but it depends on the perk, and how they compare to the guns you have
[3:03:26] <startstoprepeat> they can't get mod slots and they don't have random rolls, so you can get potentially better stuff, but some of them are still solid.
[3:03:27] <%Iccirrus> The IKELOS HC is pretty solid
[3:03:27] <%Aeoneth> Hover over the white icon
[3:03:27] <$valriot> 2 bed perks aren't better than 1
[3:03:29] <%QueequegTheater> Sturm is better
[3:03:31] <%Aeoneth> Yeah it's awesome
[3:03:31] <reinbachthe3rd> Destiny 2 pretty good?
[3:03:32] <+Ryan1016> Old guns can still be good, like midnight coup is year 1 with outlaw rampage
[3:03:33] <shinigami40297> the ikelos weapons and raid gear are still good
[3:03:33] <+alpacasintophats> the shotgun one yes
[3:03:33] <shadowsofpain> yes they are put stat wise combined with the perk they do have can make them decent
[3:03:35] <ozuma35> ikelos has very little recoil, its awesome
[3:03:41] <%Segartner> Rose is one of the best PvP hand cannons at the moment and it only has one perk
[3:03:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> "Decent"
[3:03:43] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat You want range over anything on PC
[3:03:48] <%Aeoneth> that's why it's good
[3:03:49] <%Piemen99> Althoigh the old guns are missing perks doesnt mean the perks it already has arent good
[3:03:51] <%Iccirrus> Using a controller, you'll love how IKELOS handles
[3:03:54] <%demegodz> With most weapons
[3:03:55] <%Iccirrus> it's a 180
[3:03:56] <%Aeoneth> Precion hand cannons are the top tiers
[3:03:56] <+mrcooperblack> 180 rpms are good for controller users from what i'm told
[3:03:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat, try firing it
[3:04:08] <Veteranhelldiver17> man i hope he gets the Trust Handcannon
[3:04:12] <KnightAsteran> @mrcooperblack as someone who mains the Trust, its true
[3:04:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> Feel the gun
[3:04:14] <shadowsofpain> that's a 180 handcannon
[3:04:22] <%QueequegTheater> Sturm Pat
[3:04:23] <shadowsofpain> they dont have bloom
[3:04:29] <+Ryan1016> There's kinetic energy weps
[3:04:39] <+Ryan1016> err
[3:04:40] <+Ryan1016> special
[3:04:43] <ExistentialSteak> is destiny actually challenging, my biggest issue with warframe is that it's all too easy after a certain point.
[3:04:46] <Aydarkzero> Get this man an imperial decree
[3:04:46] <%Segartner> Do you have the Botheration Blue shotgun?
[3:04:50] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Maybe check your year 1 weapons? Might be a kinetic or two in there
[3:04:51] <%Iccirrus> special weapons pat,not energy
[3:04:56] <%Iccirrus> that's what he meant
[3:04:57] <Veteranhelldiver17> Arbalest!
[3:04:57] <%QueequegTheater> Kinetic special
[3:05:00] <Chainsaw105> if it has an element, it goes into energy
[3:05:02] <%Aeoneth> It was a mistype
[3:05:04] <+Ryan1016> @Iccirrus Yes
[3:05:08] <$valriot> Black Armoury has some GREAT weapons to use
[3:05:08] <+DrN0rd> the game has changed lol
[3:05:11] <%dekkitout> They do elemental damage, but are primary ammo type
[3:05:14] <%Iccirrus> if you check your collections for green ammo weapons
[3:05:14] <%TubeMan642> Pat get rid of your planetary tokens they are useless
[3:05:17] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the ace of spades shoots fire bullets when empowered and it's a kinetic slot
[3:05:17] <+DrN0rd> the green
[3:05:18] <KnightAsteran> people still call special energy weps caus eof D1
[3:05:19] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat If you're going to be doing more Strikes/Crucible/Gambit, work on Solstice Armor for your main since you have one week left. Also, since you use Controller, 180 Hand Cannons will be good for you
[3:05:19] <%Iccirrus> green weapon tab
[3:05:23] <%Aeoneth> click the green ammo icon
[3:05:24] <Tucker0603> GREEN AMMO

[3:05:36] <+SubSamwich> there's a couple year one kinetic specials, but not many
[3:05:37] <RamenRiderZ> @existentialsteak Solo the Shattered Throne
[3:05:38] <+Pyroclase> GREEN AMMO
[3:05:38] <%king_wragles> man, nightshade and origin story... my two favorite work horses
[3:05:44] <ScreamLord> @dekkitout There is a kinetic Linier Fusion Rifle called the Arbalist that kicks ass
[3:05:47] <Veteranhelldiver17> @DrN0rd yup now that bungie told Activision to go to hell, they can do the shit they want
[3:05:50] <+Pyroclase> perfect paradox is amazing
[3:05:56] <FennecZephyr> see? Kinetic shotguns
[3:05:56] <%Iccirrus> perfect paradox is solid
[3:05:57] <%Aeoneth> Perfect Paradox is a dece shotty even in Y2
[3:05:59] <+Ryan1016> Paradox is good
[3:05:59] <Tucker0603> USE PERFECT PARADOX
[3:06:01] <+Ryan1016> real good
[3:06:01] <startstoprepeat> paradox ain't bad
[3:06:02] <%dekkitout> Not as much ass as Chaperone
[3:06:02] <%Segartner> dust rock blues
[3:06:04] <FennecZephyr> If it's facing to the left, it's kinetic @AngriestPat
[3:06:05] <Tucker0603> it's my favorite
[3:06:07] <%totesmcgoat_> Perfect Paradox is great
[3:06:07] <ozuma35> mercury
[3:06:11] <%Aeoneth> Osiris Prophecies
[3:06:13] <+SubSamwich> Paradox is quite good
[3:06:14] <%Segartner> BOTHERATION MK
[3:06:14] <%Gray_skies1993> god the Perfect Paradox has such an appealing design
[3:06:17] <%Segartner> get it pat
[3:06:17] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat All the Guns faceing LEFT are kinetic, (first slot) and the GUns facing RIGHT are energy (second slot)
[3:06:18] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat There is a kinetic Linier Fusion Rifle called the Arbalist that kicks ass
[3:06:18] <%dekkitout> Chaperone punts asses across the county
[3:06:19] <shadowsofpain> that's one is one of my favorite guns
[3:06:22] <%Aeoneth> DRB is Y2 only
[3:06:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> Requiem.... oh ohhh!
[3:06:26] <+DrN0rd> check your vault maybe
[3:06:32] <%Iccirrus> you'll get there
[3:06:34] <%Iccirrus> don't worry about it
[3:06:35] <%totesmcgoat_> Now DRB has to have a good roll, and that's only for pvp
[3:06:41] <%Starlight_Gamer> saint 13 quest
[3:06:47] <+Pyroclase> MOST of them are trash
[3:06:49] <Tucker0603> no
[3:06:49] <+Pyroclase> not all
[3:06:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> No
[3:06:51] <%Iccirrus> Compared to well rolled gear they are
[3:06:52] <MasterDecoder> @Starlight_Gamer Saint-14
[3:06:52] <Tucker0603> most
[3:06:55] <mr_red117> no
[3:06:55] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Most of them are. Some are not.
[3:06:57] <%dekkitout> Not necessarily
[3:06:57] <+Ryan1016> No, a lot of them are trash because of the rolls were trash, some are good
[3:06:58] <%totesmcgoat_> Not necessarily
[3:06:58] <%Iccirrus> but until you get good rolls, they're fine
[3:06:58] <%QueequegTheater> Not better than Sturm and Drang tho
[3:06:59] <$valriot> A good Year 1 is still good
[3:06:59] <startstoprepeat> some archetypes and perk combos still hold up
[3:07:00] <+SubSamwich> all Y2 weapons CAN be better
[3:07:00] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat have you unlocked the black armoury?
[3:07:02] <Veteranhelldiver17> it's like riding a bike, once you get it you get it
[3:07:03] <%Aeoneth> Semi. All Y2 have an extra perk, but some frames may Y1 guns still worth using
[3:07:05] <+DrN0rd> those year 1 weapons you got are the good ones
[3:07:06] <mr_red117> it depends on what perks you roll
[3:07:08] <RamenRiderZ> Leviathan Hand Cannon still holds up
[3:07:08] <KnightAsteran> they're trahs compared to God rolled Y2 pat
[3:07:12] <FennecZephyr> Year 1 guns are worse than good year 2 guns. Some year 1 guns still hold up
[3:07:13] <Budda37> they safe bets
[3:07:15] <$valriot> But Year 2 stuff is more flexible
[3:07:16] <%25RPM> you need to get good rolls though pat for them to be better
[3:07:20] <ScreamLord> The Ikolos Shotty is still good
[3:07:20] <%ArcanumMBD> hey chat, how do i see what the weekly challenges are now? Like the flashpoint planet and stuff like that?
[3:07:23] <Arweynn> 95% of them are. The other 5% are still godlike unless you have a year2 with the same roll.
[3:07:23] <shinigami40297> No, hell midnight coup is still the best pve hand cannon unless you wanna farm reckoning
[3:07:24] <+DrN0rd> ooo click that bounty
[3:07:27] <shadowsofpain> compared but a bad gun with 2 bad perks is worse than a great gun with only 1 perk
[3:07:38] <%Iccirrus> Ah,that'll get you hammerhead
[3:07:38] <+DrN0rd> click that bounty you'll get something
[3:07:39] <Sullry> Gun frame
[3:07:39] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat There is a sort button on that pursuits menu btw
[3:07:40] <+SubSamwich> @ArcanumMBD those are the gold circles next to locations
[3:07:41] <%Iccirrus> a great machine gun
[3:07:41] <Chainsaw105> its the shotgun that you give to Saint-14 for him to give to you for you to give to him
[3:07:42] <alexmemes> Ikelos SG very much still good
[3:07:42] <FennecZephyr> For you, who has mostly crap year 2 guns, it could be worth it to run some year 1 stuff
[3:07:43] <%totesmcgoat_> Y2 have 2 perks and random rolls, Y1 is still curated rolls and 1 perk but that doesn't take away how the gun feels
[3:07:45] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Yeah, you need to finish the whole quest, then itll have you talk to Ada, then she will say "Forge here, go do"
[3:07:46] <%Aeoneth> nono, you just need to kill hive with any Power weapon (purple bricks)
[3:07:47] <+informedotaku> people are recommending weapons with consideration that you don't own most hear two weapons
[3:07:51] <Budda37> baseketball
[3:07:56] <%ArcanumMBD> @SubSamwich can you no longer see just a list of them all now?

[3:08:55] <%Iccirrus> @joey_JoestarXD yeah
[3:08:56] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Thats how the Trust feels
[3:08:57] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I honestly can't wait to see what type of stuff Bungie begins to pull with Destiny 2. I'll lose my shit if we manage to start getting more story centralized within the game itself.
[3:09:01] <+Pyroclase> oooh, that's a decent roll
[3:09:02] <+Ryan1016> Good roll
[3:09:03] <%Iccirrus> that's great!

[3:09:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I like the way it looks
[3:09:22] <%Iccirrus> good rolls on 2 great looking gambit guns
[3:09:24] <%totesmcgoat_> Every gun feels different, you have to try them out before you throw them away
[3:09:25] <+Pyroclase> they are jealous of your rolls patrick
[3:09:27] <MasterDecoder> IT'S GOOD
[3:09:28] <shadowsofpain> you got a pvp godroll
