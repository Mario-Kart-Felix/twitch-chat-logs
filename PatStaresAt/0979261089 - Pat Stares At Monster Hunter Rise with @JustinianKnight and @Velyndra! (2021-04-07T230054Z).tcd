[0:26:10] <jamox1> Sand man Pat
[0:26:15] <%Kaask> charge blade is super easy
[0:26:18] <@SoFarFetched> @Monkeyweed21 you can still like women when dating a guy.
[0:26:18] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[0:26:20] <@SSaryn> Basically learn how to charge things and it becomes muscle memory.
[0:26:21] <SPidERMan8576> AoT basement is finally over
[0:26:22] <%Rumbutt> I love Charge Blade so much
[0:26:22] <%BoxNavy> charge blade is maximum effort for minimal return
[0:26:24] <%shadowace2400> God dammit, they end it one a cliffhanger
[0:26:26] <$Futurecity10> Once you learn charge blade it becomes second nature
[0:26:28] <jamox1> Pat how far are you in rise?
[0:26:29] <%Kaask> its the most "complex" weapon, but ridiculously easy to use and learn
[0:26:30] <Profmcstevie> Charge Blade is simple: HIT ENEMY, GET JUICE, STOCK JUICE,CONTINUE
[0:26:31] <%chill_o_wisp> charge blade isn't that hard tbh
[0:26:31] <+D00msDayDan> charge blade isn't that hard, just learn a couple of combos and cash out the Big Damage
[0:26:32] <%AzureGale> What if Rise was referring to a person in-game
[0:26:33] <%Monkeyweed21> No its cuz it wants to suck Yu Narukami's dick
[0:26:35] <+CookieCutter007> big axe mode
[0:26:39] <+mechslayer71> It’s just a flowchart
[0:26:41] <%valriot> Charge Blade is mostly all Counter into SAD
[0:26:42] <wolfen091> to be fair im only good with hammer, greatsword, and long sword
[0:26:44] <PanicSwytch> Gief snoring is the content i came to experience
[0:26:45] <%Alazull> THEN YOU TURN IT INTO A SPINNING AXE
[0:26:47] <+faisalspeedwagon> What's good pat
[0:26:53] <%BoxNavy> just wait for arekkz weapon guide series to be done
[0:26:54] <+Tuba_Anon> MASH ALL THE BUTTONS
[0:26:54] <SPidERMan8576> Dual blades all the way

[0:27:05] <$Ziegsy> Its pronounced 'Ree-say'#
[0:27:06] <DianaTheAscian> great explanation
[0:27:06] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:27:07] <hamborgini> see? simple!
[0:27:13] <Profmcstevie> Charge Blade is for JUICERS, just always filling them vials
[0:27:17] <+kyokadesuu> Sounds simple enough
[0:27:19] <rasamune> The loop is complicated but there is only the loop
[0:27:19] <+terry_quest> i mean there is a training area for a reason
[0:27:22] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Switch Axe is the best Bae
[0:27:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ?!?!?!?!?!?!?

[0:27:35] <%Rumbutt> Pat's making it seem way more complicated than it is
[0:27:37] <jcflyguy> Sim-ple!
[0:27:38] <%BoxNavy> in other words watch a weapon guide
[0:27:38] <+D00msDayDan> watching gura struggle to learn charge blade on stream hurt me
[0:27:38] <jamox1> He’s being complicated on purpose
[0:27:39] <%MegboyManuel> W-what?

[0:29:46] <%Alazull> @amused_platypus Yes
[0:29:46] <%YakumoYomi> Not if he bought the CPU and GPU now, since those are still in short supply
[0:29:48] <%Monkeyweed21> NEVER BRINGING THAT BACK
[0:29:49] <Saltmeisterr> yeauj
[0:29:55] <xxxpartygoatxxx> no its ps5 pnly
[0:29:56] <@SSaryn> I wish they had 8 player lobbies at least but hey.
[0:29:57] <%Paralurx> @SSaryn okay SSaryn, you've now convinced me that you aren't *that* stinky
[0:29:57] <rekinom> I'm soloing hub right now and it feels fine
[0:30:00] <JustYudha> it runs like ass on the switch
[0:30:01] <%amused_platypus> @SSaryn thank you
[0:30:06] <Theoyveyman> Not a fan
[0:30:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt i do miss single high rank
[0:30:09] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:30:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this game has no annoying Handler, 10/10
[0:30:19] <Aydarkzero> that world system was not great
[0:30:20] <%logoth_> Didnt you like the HANDLER??
[0:30:20] <Profmcstevie> Single for the complete beginner, multi for the "I'm fucking ready" mode
[0:30:21] <%amused_platypus> @JustYudha to be expected
[0:30:22] <%Alazull> Had to wait for cutscene to fire SOS Flare
[0:30:23] <+terry_quest> also sieges suck in world
[0:30:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I do miss investigations though
[0:30:25] <%BoxNavy> and village is really short now so its extra good
[0:30:25] <Aydarkzero> i just played everything solo
[0:30:30] <%Monkeyweed21> they fixed the cutscene thing in Rise
[0:30:35] <dizimous> The story was really unimpressive, hire a writer or leave me alone
[0:30:35] <primarch_lupercal> hoping we see commandos against bad batch
[0:30:38] <+HodouVAN> key quests were fundamentally broken and frustrating... back when they were invisible and all mandatory
[0:30:43] <bear_breaker20> @Aydarkzero sad to see
[0:30:45] <Aydarkzero> i actually thought the Handler was okay but that might just be 1st game syndrome
[0:30:49] <%YakumoYomi> wen i fite aktor?
[0:30:51] <@SSaryn> Correct. And as long as you aren't a salty bitch who dies to a LR Khezu and says game sucks, it is indeed good.
[0:30:57] <%logoth_> Talking about Umemaro 3D
[0:30:59] <$RealThiele> YEAH PORN

[0:31:07] <+mikesapartment> which tags tho
[0:31:09] <%emperordread> Friends let friends discuss pornography
[0:31:11] <SubliminaIMessages> Oh no
[0:31:14] <%Alazull> Handler wasn't too bad it's just the amount of her dialogue that made it bad
[0:31:18] <balthazar758> pron
[0:31:18] <%Monkeyweed21> well now they are
[0:31:21] <Zeikier> porn-o-graffy
[0:31:22] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:31:22] <Broken_Sonex> Ah yeah, some good old fashioned pornography
[0:31:22] <dizimous> I liked the handler at first and the story gradually made me like her less, now I enjoy bullying her
[0:31:26] <dan_g_v> hope things get better @doc_ock_rokc
[0:31:29] <@SSaryn> Why aren't they talk about pornography though
[0:31:30] <jamox1> Pat is trying to manifest content
[0:31:34] <$RealThiele> Lady D with her foot large than shaqs
[0:31:34] <%logoth_> Handler was an annoying tag along who ended up hurting you
[0:31:36] <the_krypto_knight> I was doing charge blade in world but just weebing it up with long sword is so good
[0:31:47] <BlueSpartan119> I'm so glad 3 player scaling exists now
[0:31:47] <%AncelDeLambert> HELLOOOOOOO
[0:31:49] <$RealThiele> wow clean

Somehow I don't thing this game about hunting giant monsters in pulse pounding battles, straping parts of those monsters to sticks, and then finding and killing EVEN BIGGER monsters will ever catch on in the US. CHAOS LEGION on the other hand....
[0:58:26] <Theoyveyman> Hey Pat this is just reskinned Redhelm

[1:01:17] <Blank9> they train their children to mount turrets
[1:01:21] <%YakumoYomi> I thought the Rampage was specific to this area, though
[1:01:23] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib toes
[1:01:24] <JackaxeAM> The candy child MUST shoot monsters
[1:01:25] <hexen_emma> The fact humans aren't wiped out in this world is amazing.
[1:01:25] <%AzureGale> Dog is a foot fetishist

[1:01:35] <+mechslayer71> Why is pat not power sheathing?  @patstaresat
[1:01:37] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt From jobber monsters, these aren't even Elder Dragons
[1:01:41] <%AzureGale> Is there a 690 counter signal too
[1:01:42] <Saltmeisterr> pewpewpew
[1:01:46] <%blaggablag> That's the whole deal with the hunter's guild. They're a deterrent.
[1:01:47] <dan_g_v> this is a real natural Apex
[1:01:49] <moosemonkey397> 6:30 left in the hunt
[1:01:52] <DianaTheAscian> hes got a big health bar
[1:01:53] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I still don't actually know what the counter signal does
[1:01:55] <$RealThiele> yes gief
[1:01:55] <Blank9> this is an accurate representation of an Apex monster without Wyvernstones
[1:02:05] <%hamborgini> if only you had some nice socks... I heard about some on a podcast once
[1:02:05] <+Ironbuttz> Zangief is a foot dude
[1:02:06] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> Like the honey badger he is based on, he doesn't give a fuck
[1:02:10] <cherrycottontail> @DynDimAcsiwn increases player damage
[1:02:15] <%kyh9> IMAGINE APEX MAGNAMALO
[1:02:16] <Nordguy> counter signal is damage up
[1:02:19] <%VioletHeart> @DynDimAcsiwn Massive damage boost for hunters. It means "Get off the guns, go hit it"
[1:02:22] <penitentpendant> When a boss has so much HP he'd have every color of the rainbow as health bars
[1:02:24] <+DynDimAcsiwn> oh ok
[1:02:26] <+Dorf1> im butthurt the deviants are locked behind this minigame
[1:02:35] <BlueSpartan119> yes
[1:02:36] <cherrycottontail> it's like 5x the damage too
[1:02:37] <Alzero83> yes
[1:02:37] <Blank9> yeah, only in rampages
[1:02:37] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I thought it empowered the guns lmao
[1:02:39] <$RealThiele> this is almost too much hp
[1:02:41] <+Rafraud> For now I believe so
[1:02:43] <%kyh9> How the fuck would you deal Apexes out of this
[1:02:44] <Theoyveyman> Yep
[1:02:48] <%DEETRz> yup for now
[1:02:48] <+Rafraud> Hopefully they update it
[1:02:49] <BlueSpartan119> I hope they add Apex hunts in event quests
[1:02:49] <Blank9> I bet they make them on their own eventually
[1:02:50] <%YakumoYomi> Apexes are currently exclusive to Rampage
[1:02:50] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes only here
[1:02:50] <+Kiaayo> he's just a big arzuros, he's not unique at all
[1:02:51] <%shadowace2400> yup
[1:02:51] <Alzero83> Theres several Apex monsters only in Rampage
[1:02:55] <%psidefx> Juggled
[1:02:56] <dan_g_v> combo!
[1:03:01] <+Holesale> yep apex locked away behind this mode for now which is a shame cause Apex Rathian is sick
[1:03:04] <+DynDimAcsiwn> apexes out of this mode with limited carts would suck ass
[1:03:05] <+TheBitingIrish> Apex in this game are basically the Deviant monsters
[1:03:07] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the Tekken bear
[1:03:09] <Manwad> I love the shit where you impact a wall and just splat
[1:03:11] <+HodouVAN> apexes are only in rampages because they have unique moves that target the gate and also are designed to just one-shot you
[1:03:15] <Theoyveyman> But if it makes you feel better, it's just Deviants with a few new moves
[1:03:15] <powerprotoman> well their not all that unique, their just reskins of the deviants from generations
[1:03:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat...
[1:03:19] <+D00msDayDan> sumimascuse me
[1:03:24] <$JojoPiero> You had to use the Splitting to do SIX THOUSAND DAMAGE, do you want to have to do that much just for a knockdown outside of this?
[1:03:25] <UnfilteredComic> aircombos are nuts in this game
[1:03:26] <penitentpendant> Why... did you place him up top?
[1:03:27] <%kyh9> OH GOD
[1:03:28] <+Dorf1> @Kiaayo that isnt true, all the apexes in this game have the deviant movesets from mhX
[1:03:29] <%sleeplessmetro> pat..
[1:03:31] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh fuck, that still reached?
[1:03:37] <$RealThiele> LUL hes so far away
[1:03:38] <%kyh9> Why did you place him where he won't do anything
[1:03:40] <cherrycottontail> Apex Azuros is the Azuros with the foot fetish
[1:03:41] <0range_> He is still alive
[1:03:43] <%YakumoYomi> Apex almost dead
[1:03:46] <%kyh9> lmao
[1:03:58] <Blank9> I can't believe how much health the gate has
[1:04:04] <%hamborgini> is there any way to see how much health the gate has left? I've never noticed a meter anywhere....
[1:04:06] <%kyh9> CAn't bbelieve how well this is running
[1:04:09] <DianaTheAscian> that gate holds up for a bit
[1:04:10] <$RealThiele> 1459!
[1:04:17] <%BoxNavy> pats getting pingponged
[1:04:17] <+DynDimAcsiwn> @hamborgini top left
[1:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> damn, Pat's a pinball
[1:04:23] <SovPho> are ya winning son
[1:04:24] <dan_g_v> aww yeah, we almost done with the first of 5 phases of Apex
[1:04:24] <Blank9> you have infinite carts on rampage
[1:04:25] <0range_> freaking behemoth badger that doesnt give a fuck
[1:04:29] <%YakumoYomi> Infinite carts in Rampages, Pat
[1:04:31] <penitentpendant> This bear ate all his wheaties... then the whole wheaty factory
[1:04:31] <+DynDimAcsiwn> the petals are the health
[1:04:32] <Alzero83> Charge up the Nuke again at the Power Kilns
[1:04:32] <Blank9> it just costs time
[1:04:34] <$JojoPiero> @hamborgini The Yellow Gate above the map gets broken down slowly
[1:04:35] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I don't think you get penalized for carting in this mode do you?
[1:04:41] <+Raspada_Ryner> I don't think there's cart penalties
[1:04:41] <%VioletHeart> @hamborgini Bottom left, just above the minimap.
[1:04:44] <DianaTheAscian> @hamborgini well in the older games the quest info would tell u
[1:04:47] <SovPho> you can speed up the cooldown at that furnace
[1:04:50] <Alzero83> No you can Charge the NUke again @PatStaresAt
[1:04:51] <Hellhound90008> rampages dont have a faint limit
[1:04:54] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Its on cooldown
[1:04:56] <+Holesale> you can charge it by feeding coal into the furnace
[1:04:57] <Alzero83> The Power Kilns charge it faster
[1:05:00] <%Kaask> shovel coal
[1:05:00] <+HodouVAN> gate HP in lower-left, icon indicates damage phases (the HP bar you see isn't the entire health of the gate)
[1:05:01] <Blank9> shovel coal into the kiln to recharge nukes and dragonators
[1:05:02] <+TheBitingIrish> @PatStaresAt You can shovel coal into the furnace to lower Wyvernshot CD
[1:05:03] <DianaTheAscian> @hamborgini but idk if they kept that
[1:05:07] <JackaxeAM> Good job, Elmo
[1:05:16] <%hamborgini> that's the stronghold level gauge, not the gate health I'm pretty sure, since it's going up, not down
[1:05:21] <+DynDimAcsiwn> rampages have so many mechanics that I just didn't understand lmao
[1:05:24] <SovPho> has anybody failed a rampage yet
[1:05:25] <+Das_Prints> You can speed up the cooldown of the wyvern shot by dmfeeding coal into the furnaces on the corners near the gate
[1:05:30] <+badnewsmike> @raspada_ryner there's bonus rewards for keeping it under 3 carts tho (but yeah, no hard limit)
[1:05:31] <+DynDimAcsiwn> or didn't register
[1:05:37] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:05:38] <$JojoPiero> The BAR is Stronghold EXP, the Gate Icon is the HP
[1:05:40] <$RealThiele> sponge ded
[1:05:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What a perv
[1:05:44] <Theoyveyman> YOU DIDS IT
[1:05:45] <dan_g_v> grab the junk, Patron
[1:05:46] <%AzureGale> Is Pat a foot fetishist
[1:05:48] <Alzero83> you can Charge the NUke again at the Power Kilns @PatStaresAt
[1:05:48] <JackaxeAM> Carve Apex!
[1:05:49] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt carve hes got stuff
[1:05:50] <+pupil31> SourPls
[1:05:51] <%seraphimjordan> crave him
[1:05:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> CARVE
[1:05:53] <%Persona_EX> Persona_EX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! BIG TITTY WEED
[1:05:54] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:05:54] <jamox1> AYYY
[1:05:57] <%averyoddjew> pat go carve
[1:05:57] <%blaggablag> Carve that bear now
[1:05:59] <%BoxNavy> good job
[1:05:59] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:06:03] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT CARVE
[1:06:04] <%DEETRz> its the icon
[1:06:10] <SovPho> It's legit not worth charging stuff imo though if you have the gong up
[1:06:10] <%YakumoYomi> The yellow icon by the green bar, I believe
[1:06:12] <$RealThiele> bone
[1:06:14] <jamox1> CARVE
[1:06:15] <powerprotoman> theres also apex exclusive carves
[1:06:16] <$JojoPiero> It has unique items
[1:06:17] <$Unholyfanclub> CARVE
[1:06:19] <Blank9> they can drop unique apex stuff
[1:06:26] <%DEETRz> but you high rank now
[1:06:27] <%blaggablag> much pelt such warmth
[1:06:28] <gawdCLOUD> does anyone use the defender weapons?
[1:06:30] <penitentpendant> @YakumoYomi That's stamina
[1:06:31] <%YakumoYomi> You've got infinite carts in Rampage, by the way
[1:06:34] <%averyoddjew> you'll get it's actual drops later
[1:06:34] <SovPho> Wyvern Shot does what? 3k, 4k damage? With the gong up you can exceed the DPS burst by a lot if you just keep swinging.
[1:06:40] <Blank9> they are a mess solo
[1:06:40] <+Dorf1> the apexes have one unique drop each that you can use to make a really bad weapon
[1:06:44] <%hamborgini> a vague icon is a little less helpful than I would have liked, but I guess that's monster hunter
[1:06:46] <dan_g_v> it will be great for laying naked on that pelt
[1:06:47] <%Persona_EX> I’m really sick of my god damn Vizio not having the fucking twitch app
[1:06:50] <powerprotoman> you almost lost
[1:06:52] <Theoyveyman> LORE LORE LORE
[1:06:52] <hazzy_o7> Poor Hinoa, everyone only wants to talk to Minoto
[1:06:54] <tattleworm> you forfeit an S rank if you cart more than 3 times though
[1:06:55] <jamox1> Wait you get infinite carts in rampage ?!!?
[1:06:56] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL
[1:07:02] <+mechslayer71> Why doesn’t pat use power sheathe much?
[1:07:05] <jamox1> Man I’ve been stressed as hell for nothing
[1:07:08] <cherrycottontail> @Dorf1 this is wrong. Best hunting horn is rampage horn
[1:07:11] <$RealThiele> DQ-ass merchant man

[1:08:41] <+datmegamandeeeee> Horny psychics are bad news
[1:08:42] <+sumrand0> Why do I expect that we're gunna have to come to terms with the fact that Wyverians pushed humanity into a full on war with elder dragons centuries ago
[1:08:43] <+Dorf1> what did you guys think psychoserum or the psychic skill was?
[1:08:43] <dan_g_v> it goes up to Super Sexy Sexy rank

[1:09:30] <Aydarkzero> talk to everyone
[1:09:33] <ScreamLord> Zangeif is supported by a series of fluid filled bladders
[1:09:34] <Blank9> how the hell do regular monster hunters deal with monsters like dalamadur
[1:09:35] <%luftraumm1> you mean reál
[1:09:37] <Blank9> it's the size of a mountain

[1:11:31] <dan_g_v> oh yeah, check the Cohoot's nest for eggs? @PatStaresAt
[1:11:37] <Aydarkzero> deco's PogChamp
[1:11:39] <%hamborgini> rampage weapons are create-a-weapon
[1:11:43] <moosemonkey397> shitty weapons that give you more options and slots
[1:11:43] <%AzureGale> H-hunter-kun, I'm stuck...
[1:11:43] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Yo evade extender level 3 is crazy, try it out right now pat
[1:11:49] <Aydarkzero> WHAT
[1:11:49] <$Afterman_> rampage weapons are basically safi weapons
[1:11:57] <BlueSpartan119> and flinch free is a 1 slot deco
[1:11:58] <gawdCLOUD> are the rampage weapons any good
[1:12:00] <Ris_Eltrut> Non random Decos sim1BOG
[1:12:04] <Blank9> even the charm lets you make a specific skill to aim for
[1:12:06] <$Afterman_> @The_Forgotten_Alligator i use it and evade window for dual blade. shit is good
[1:12:07] <hazzy_o7> Rather have this RNG charm than decos tbh
[1:12:11] <dan_g_v> get the one to hold your breath underwater jewel :3
[1:12:12] <$Afterman_> ramp weapon is at hte bottom
[1:12:14] <$Afterman_> check very bottom
[1:12:14] <BlueSpartan119> Tree at the bottom
[1:12:17] <Blank9> rampage weapons are at the bottom of the list, they're customizable
[1:12:18] <%Kaask> its at the bottom
[1:12:21] <UnfilteredComic> bottom
[1:12:22] <+mechslayer71> The rampage buffs work in all hunts @patstaresat
[1:12:23] <+DynDimAcsiwn> bottom of the tree
[1:12:23] <$Afterman_> forge great swrod at the bottom of the list
[1:12:26] <SovPho> Flinch Free is rank 1 and makes it so you don't want to murder LS users
[1:12:27] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the rampage weapons is what I'm guessing the end game grind will be eventually
[1:12:29] <cherrycottontail> @gawdCLOUD best for hunting horn, unsure of others
[1:12:30] <+antthefool> WHERE ARE MY ATTACK GEMS
[1:12:31] <ScreamLord> @SovPho Dunno about SnS but the Khezu Dual Blades have Thunder and Paralysis
[1:12:33] <Blank9> you can customize the element they get
[1:12:34] <%averyoddjew> bottom of the tree
[1:12:43] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt some are good. like the rampage hunting horn is OP
[1:12:43] <@Mechz71> SMALL EYES
[1:12:44] <BlueSpartan119> no
[1:12:46] <Blank9> nope
[1:12:46] <%Kaask> it scrolls right
[1:12:48] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:12:51] <SovPho> oh yeah it's dual blades
[1:12:51] <JackaxeAM> Scroll right
[1:12:52] <%superc37> no
[1:12:53] <UnfilteredComic> You can change the color tho
[1:12:55] <Theoyveyman> I hear they get really good
[1:12:55] <%Paperware> HH is the only good rampage weapon
[1:12:58] <Captbutt> they're good, pat
[1:12:58] <dan_g_v> it's the end, you beat all the monsters already :3
[1:13:02] <+Raspada_Ryner> rampage HH  is great
[1:13:05] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> move over more
[1:13:05] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @Afterman_  don't remember evade skills being that good
[1:13:11] <+mechslayer71> No
[1:13:12] <BiologicGases> best rampage weapon is hh
[1:13:16] <%Cn_alpha_02> Check the rampage skills
[1:13:16] <%hamborgini> some trees do cap out distressingly early, though
[1:13:18] <$JojoPiero> not even close
[1:13:25] <UnfilteredComic> Rampage Dual blades are good, you can slap two elements on them
[1:13:27] <kingmemelord97> wtf is this weapon tree
[1:13:30] <gawdCLOUD> @cherrycottontail oh thanks. I'll give it a try then KPOPfan
[1:13:36] <%Garthunox> Garthunox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Pat, I haven't been keeping track of your Disco LP cos im playing it myself, but have you been inside the bookstore yet? There's some cool stuff locked behind a check there, thanks for getting me into it by the way
[1:13:37] <$JojoPiero> look at the lines, you can see which trees continue
[1:13:39] <$Afterman_> @The_Forgotten_Alligator with all the movement in this game it feel sooo good. i feel like im levi from attack on titan with my dual blades lol
[1:13:41] <+Raspada_Ryner> you can make yourself pretty much unkillable with HH
[1:13:49] <BlueSpartan119> Skalda waist is best in slot
[1:13:56] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I think Rampage Weapons are kinda like Safi weapons. You can customize their stats
[1:14:06] <%Kaask> the true monster hunter starts here
[1:14:06] <SovPho> @The_Forgotten_Alligator ?? fade slash tho??
[1:14:08] <Blank9> bug

[1:14:11] <Manwad> bug
[1:14:12] <JackaxeAM> bug

[1:14:15] <+Stormzcales_Lair> pale bone is from dick monste rkhezu
[1:14:16] <BlueSpartan119> bug from trader
[1:14:18] <+mechslayer71> Pat needs to get up on Goss Greatsword
[1:14:20] <dan_g_v> Pat doesn't know what a Skalda is
[1:14:22] <Alzero83> You finishe the Prologue, Now the Real Game begins
[1:14:23] <%hamborgini> it's from special farm bugs
[1:14:27] <Theoyveyman> I don't think Pat knows who Safi is
[1:14:30] <UnfilteredComic> Toxic Kumori is from the Argosy
[1:14:33] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wirebug is super necessary
[1:14:40] <+sumrand0> Talisman RNG isn't "saving us" from builds being straightforward to build, Talisman grinding is gunna be just as laborious as Deco grinding but. hey fine by me..
[1:14:43] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @SovPho I'm talking about evade extender
[1:14:49] <Blank9> wirebug whisperer 3 is the shit, it makes wirebugs recharge 25% faster
[1:14:49] <+Dorf1> the skalda waist is very splashable right now
[1:14:49] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wirebug cooldown op
[1:15:00] <dan_g_v> yeah, gotta do trade and trade with sexy trader gal
[1:15:07] <BlueSpartan119> it's like a 10 min buff
[1:15:08] <Blank9> dango booster increases atk/def for first 5 minutes
[1:15:09] <hazzy_o7> Dango booster is first 10 minutes of hunt auto
[1:15:10] <+McDerpus> 10 minute boost
[1:15:10] <@Mechz71> Just call Capcom to turn on your streamer drops for hunts
[1:15:11] <+DynDimAcsiwn> the game tells you when it wares off
[1:15:15] <dan_g_v> economics and all that

[1:15:27] <Equirah> @PatStaresAt skalda waist is meta
[1:15:34] <UnfilteredComic> You can buy it with money once you progress some more
[1:15:44] <$JojoPiero> booster is like 10min damage bump
[1:15:47] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I didn't bother making a single low rank set
[1:15:49] <%Monkeyweed21> this happens every time pat
[1:15:52] <+Rafraud> The late HR ones get really busted lmao
[1:15:52] <%hamborgini> isn't that always the case? I wish there were some way to upgrade LR armor into HR so it wasn't just trash for the dumpster
[1:16:02] <%patriotrenegade> A couple days ago, Max got FOUR PLATES as just drops off a monster, like they were just on the ground, it was insane
[1:16:18] <%AzureGale> IT'S DANGO TIME! TYRANNOSAURUS
[1:16:24] <Blank9> even endgame, early armor parts can find their way into your clownsuit

[1:16:36] <hazzy_o7> Could just hunt in your underwear
[1:16:42] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt also unlike in older Mon Hun games, some mats are EASIER to get via carves than capping, incase you hadn't heard yet
[1:16:43] <SovPho> Yeah I think they straight up buffed plate and gem drops I've been getting them left and right
[1:16:59] <+sumrand0> Yeah HR armor now has the same amount of skills as Master Rank armor did in world
[1:17:16] <SovPho> imagine not using demon petalace
[1:17:19] <Aydarkzero> that's nuts
[1:17:30] <%hamborgini> got 4 zinogre jaspers in 2 hunts a few days ago. it was nuts
[1:17:32] <+datmegamandeeeee> That’s because there No Master/G in this game
[1:17:37] <+datmegamandeeeee> Welcome to endgame
[1:17:48] <+sumrand0> @datmegamandeeeee YET
[1:17:58] <%AncelDeLambert> get them wirebugs
[1:18:00] <cherrycottontail> @datmegamandeeeee same as world was
[1:18:04] <+DynDimAcsiwn> it will likely get a Grank tho so that armour is gonna be nuts
[1:18:14] <+projectmanatees> The village theme CatJam
[1:18:17] <dan_g_v> new stuff!
[1:18:21] <+datmegamandeeeee> And?
[1:18:22] <dan_g_v> time for some money!
[1:18:24] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> is it only me or is Rathalos faster in this game
[1:18:26] <+sumrand0> @dyndimacsiwn exactly the point i was making
[1:18:30] <BlueLunecy> No it doesn't!
[1:18:32] <GrahamBaxter> Oh hai, Best Girl! I mean, Rondine!
[1:18:40] <%Garthunox> come to the back a da boat!
[1:18:42] <17sevens> no it doesn't pat
[1:18:43] <cherrycottontail> it doesn't need high rank materials at all
[1:18:45] <powerprotoman> funny story you can get the mats for the third sub in low rank
[1:18:45] <+ALazo> ? It doesn't need high rank materials
[1:18:45] <DianaTheAscian> it is now i guess
[1:18:49] <Theoyveyman> Think so
[1:18:52] <+datmegamandeeeee> Not comparing it to world, i was just saying that this is endgame
[1:18:58] <%BubbaRands> BubbaRands subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Oh boy a full 12-months has passed since the end times began. Take my Bezos Bucks as tribute and thank you for keeping my sanity slightly below the brink.
[1:19:02] <+mechslayer71> It’s low rank materials
[1:19:10] <+D00msDayDan> actually argosy is the name of the shipping company, her ship is called the argiven
[1:19:17] <+TyrantBelial> Wiat we can't pick what they can learn?
[1:19:19] <cherrycottontail> Hey Pat, can you show me your pet skills?
[1:19:29] <+TyrantBelial> So they literally ruined what made world palicos good?
[1:19:33] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I wouldn't really call high rank the endgame
[1:19:40] <+DynDimAcsiwn> feels more like the game
[1:19:52] <Blank9> How close is this town to Moga anyway? It has the sandy plains and flooded forest close to it.
[1:19:55] <+sumrand0> @datmegamandeeeee "endgame" is a temporary endpoint with updates the endgame always gets extended and expanded
[1:19:58] <cherrycottontail> does anyone wanna take bets on Pat having never equipped his buddy skills
[1:20:29] <%AncelDeLambert> do you even use pitfall traps that often?
[1:20:29] <Aydarkzero> gotta farm those max potion mats
[1:20:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @Blank9 this is the Japan to Moga's phillipines
[1:20:33] <SovPho> Palicos actively excluding Malamutes from the name of Meowcenaries because they don't respect them

[1:24:05] <dan_g_v> @The_Forgotten_Alligator  since this is a postapocalyptic world, Almudron has past cyber armor :3
[1:24:09] <+datmegamandeeeee> Yes
[1:24:37] <SovPho> YOU HATE PENOR?
[1:24:43] <+datmegamandeeeee> For girls its cyber catgirl armor... yeeeeey
[1:24:45] <ghoulspan> kesu means cheese in my language
[1:24:48] <+Dorf1> multi monster quests in this game are meaningless outside of the arena.
[1:24:53] <Theoyveyman> You guys do know the whole Dragon War post-apocalypse thing ISN'T canon right?
[1:24:59] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:25:03] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Hey can I interest you in a Khezu plush for Zangief, the neck really extends!
[1:25:08] <%SirGO0SE> psaDogchamp observe it
[1:25:16] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Japanese sounds like he's singing the lines
[1:25:17] <Blank9> I wish they had more arenas, Generations had the best ones by far
[1:25:18] <+DynDimAcsiwn> oh this sucks
[1:25:21] <%hamborgini> these poems really like the word "nigh" for some reason
[1:25:22] <Ris_Eltrut> sim1BUHP No you put your dick away
[1:25:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought for a second that you said Thunder in Paradise and I got confused
[1:25:29] <+DynDimAcsiwn> the japanese and mh language ones are so much better
[1:25:35] <cherrycottontail> I like the english ones better
[1:25:38] <DublinRage> MEowth, dat's right!
[1:25:39] <SovPho> They sing (ish) in the Japanese ones
[1:25:40] <Saltmeisterr> banger alert
[1:25:41] <wolfen091> what kind of weeb are you pat, that you don't do Japanese voices
[1:25:50] <+mechslayer71> @cherrycottontail cmonBruh

[1:25:59] <%SirGO0SE> thats a good voice clip there
[1:26:00] <DublinRage> (sorry thought they were going there with the haiku)
[1:26:05] <%AzureGale> Don't get penisy
[1:26:09] <Captbutt> this game's music is so good
[1:26:10] <Ipsenscastle> those handles are scrotal, i hate it
[1:26:19] <%BubbaRands> wiff
[1:26:22] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt tell justinian if he hasn't he def needs to try the aerial combo skills, they are so good for flying/large monsters
[1:26:27] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @mechslayer71 xD
[1:26:28] <DianaTheAscian> oh Kojima is trending
[1:26:38] <Ris_Eltrut> Abandon quest for that
[1:26:42] <DianaTheAscian> on twitter*
[1:26:46] <+sumrand0> @blank9 generations was built with existing assets so it was easy to include more since they didn't need to build from scratch. there will 100% be a large amount of those quests added in updates going forwards
[1:26:50] <ZE_Count> Hows the monster hunting Pat?
[1:26:50] <%AzureGale> This is the end, now fall
[1:26:54] <+ArtemisCroc> LUL
[1:27:06] <+Celarious> I love the massive speed boost of OG Demon mode more
[1:27:09] <penitentpendant> "Only" when he's streaming
[1:27:12] <sirtommygunn> exposed balls
[1:27:17] <Blank9> Yeah, but still, there was actual variety to the arenas themselves. And more monsters with better challenges and setups.
[1:27:17] <+athuramn> so frustating indeed
[1:27:19] <%hamborgini> what if I said it was merely the "okay I guess" sword
[1:27:26] <Rashnam> frusdating rooKek
[1:27:32] <+Dorf1> didnt pat say greatsword was his main on the podcast? ...kinda sussy
[1:27:34] <Blank9> Arenas this time don't even have unique item setups. They're almost all 10 potions, 10 rations.
[1:27:52] <Manwad> am i crazy or does the new flak ammo deal like no damage?
[1:27:54] <+mechslayer71> I wish the Magna GS was more competitive, it looks great. Same for the armor
[1:28:00] <+sumrand0> man when you play a slow, hard hitting weapon.....if you miss its like you're not even in the hunt LUL
[1:28:06] <Blank9> flak's bad
[1:28:22] <+mechslayer71> Pat needs to power sheathe more
[1:28:33] <$Afterman_> that shit is good good for big monsters
[1:28:41] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @sumrand0 if you miss a lot yeah xD
[1:28:45] <Blank9> bow is amazing now with gyro controls
[1:29:05] <DianaTheAscian> oh cool some L.bowgun love
[1:29:09] <%YakumoYomi> He will. It just takes a lot for Wroggi to go to sleep
[1:29:18] <+sumrand0> dude fuckkkk the random deviation on bowguns now, I mean sure it should actually impact weapon performance but still...fuck curving shots that miss from 15 ft away
[1:29:55] <dan_g_v> now don't mess it up!
[1:29:56] <%Agami23> now pat can actually hit the monster!
[1:30:14] <dan_g_v> we need Jaggi too
[1:30:21] <+sumrand0> @agami23 lol you're not wrong
[1:30:25] <%SirGO0SE> i think its mean that you kil after you fren :(
[1:30:29] <dan_g_v> we need the fated four Gi's
[1:30:31] <rasamune> It's also an easy way to communicate "this guy ain't shit"
[1:30:32] <mybigmeech> Great maccro the GOAT
[1:30:35] <+datmegamandeeeee> You fight so many losers in this game
[1:30:35] <%weissguard> I mean, Great Jaggi is right there as well.
[1:30:36] <GrahamBaxter> Nobody likes Velocidrome
[1:30:36] <DianaTheAscian> I miss Great Jaggi
[1:30:38] <+crazydiamondzz> I miss Great Jaggi  :(
[1:30:38] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> wonder if valtrax is gonna be in the ucoming update, that'd be sick
[1:30:41] <%BoxNavy> great
[1:30:41] <Zeif00> Jump Four Jaggi
[1:30:43] <Ipsenscastle> PAaAAAaAT
[1:30:44] <mybigmeech> Got the name wrong shit
[1:30:49] <+HodouVAN> baggi and izuchi are two of the best ones so at least this game picked well
[1:30:50] <+McDerpus> great Maccao is best
[1:30:51] <Theoyveyman> We need Zamtrios
[1:30:55] <sirtommygunn> Bird up
[1:30:56] <penitentpendant> You seperated yourself from the monsters
[1:30:59] <%hotcarl6872> fuck
[1:31:04] <+HodouVAN> yeah maccao is sick

[1:31:13] <Blank9> pat's the real monster
[1:31:17] <+datmegamandeeeee> Walk theough the holes lol
[1:31:19] <sirtommygunn> wow that would've been a sick shot if you landed it
[1:31:19] <DianaTheAscian> We super need Zamtrios as well
[1:31:28] <dan_g_v> so, a tiny bird squad? Maccao, Kulu, Curo?
[1:31:37] <dan_g_v> with big boss Malfestio?
[1:31:40] <%BubbaRands> I kinda miss Kecha Wacha...
[1:31:40] <%hotcarl6872> Zamtrios and Tetsu
[1:32:09] <dan_g_v> oh yeah, a froggo team with Zam, Tetsu and Tetrano
[1:32:13] <Blank9> bishaten is a good kecha wacha replacement
[1:32:14] <%GalacticaPhanto> maybe we'll get Gore Magala?
[1:32:14] <weissguard> I'm just gonna hope that Astalos makes it in a future update. Love that thing.
[1:32:42] <%BubbaRands> Tetsucabra Armor was fuckin LIT
[1:32:43] <+Dorf1> great maccao is the only generic raptor monster i liked
[1:32:49] <Blank9> Astalos and Valstrax would be great
[1:32:50] <dan_g_v> we need a Gammoth so it can has a turf war against Tigrex
[1:33:06] <+datmegamandeeeee> I want seregios and gore mh4 needs love
[1:33:19] <Theoyveyman> And Nercsylla, & AAgnaktor, & Lagiacrus
[1:33:33] <dan_g_v> we need more bugs, period
[1:33:40] <%hotcarl6872> thee are all good choices
[1:33:51] <Ris_Eltrut> I want more new monsters
[1:33:51] <+McDerpus> if you need to, you can wirebug park our over the gate
[1:34:01] <DianaTheAscian> Lagi didn't make it in did he?
[1:34:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Justinian can have a little poison. As a treat.
[1:34:14] <+datmegamandeeeee> Nah
[1:34:14] <%BoxNavy> ???
[1:34:14] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:34:19] <%YakumoYomi> It's a crime that they included the likes of Anjanath and Pukei-Pukei, but not Odogaron
[1:34:21] <krnksk> LUL
[1:34:22] <%BubbaRands> So we all agree. No Qurupeco right?
[1:34:23] <sirtommygunn> wow
[1:34:27] <%BoxNavy> it did happened
[1:34:28] <dan_g_v> wifi warrior
[1:34:29] <Zeif00> the wiffs
[1:34:29] <%walternatorz> suuuuure
[1:34:43] <Theoyveyman> They no longer have the excuse of "we need to translate the skeletons into the new engine"
[1:34:43] <sirtommygunn> pat thought "i have him now" and crazy talk shifted him
[1:34:45] <%hotcarl6872> i feel like Lagi would be great but they need to rework his moveset for the land
[1:34:47] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:34:53] <%FacetiousAF> was that THE do it?!
[1:35:00] <+Dorf1> querpeco would be pointless in this game since having 2 monsters in one spot is an objective boon to the plaer
[1:35:01] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> lol pat has "TRAP" too
[1:35:05] <cherrycottontail> wifi on this game is 100% workable
[1:35:11] <%BoxNavy> schut
[1:35:25] <Ris_Eltrut> @hotcarl6872 they already did that
[1:35:26] <sirtommygunn> dont hit the monster after you capture it wtf pat, animal cruelty
[1:35:45] <PyroDrag> so apparently you can only get some parts by carving exclusively in this game, like previous titles
[1:35:46] <%AzureGale> Hawr
[1:35:50] <PyroDrag> cant wait to farm for those
[1:35:51] <%blaggablag> redbars begone reee
[1:35:53] <Saltmeisterr> what
[1:36:00] <JackaxeAM> Not really worth it.
[1:36:08] <+Holesale> ele reload is traaaaaash
[1:36:15] <Blank9> you get more materials by carving nowadays
[1:36:23] <BlueSpartan119> GS is 5* LS is 6*
[1:36:30] <+Kiaayo> it is
[1:36:32] <+aspirationdeath> greatsword is dope you get a parry counter that gives you true full charge instantly
[1:36:33] <%YakumoYomi> Most people seem to be running Raw on LBG anyway (Narga for RF Pierce, from what I've seen)
[1:36:34] <+Kiaayo> capture is 2, carve is 3
[1:36:37] <%BoxNavy> it depends on what you want
[1:36:37] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Nargacuga Mellow or something is carving
[1:36:43] <$Afterman_> some items are EASIER to get with carves not onlu
[1:36:53] <%kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 42 god damn months amazing.
[1:36:53] <Theoyveyman> Does Pat know what the HR invader is in this game?
[1:36:53] <inpaladin> capture gives 2-4, carving always gives 3
[1:36:59] <Mattais88> What IS the difference between part break and monster drop?
[1:37:00] <%JumboCrunchies> Pat, its super true now
[1:37:00] <BlueSpartan119> they changed it Pat
[1:37:02] <cherrycottontail> Capture is not 2, capture is random
[1:37:02] <+ArtemisCroc> switch axe is really funny with rapid morph and coating switch boost
[1:37:04] <PyroDrag> Magnamalo Blades
[1:37:05] <$Afterman_> gaijin hunter made a video about this yesterday or the day before
[1:37:08] <+datmegamandeeeee> Depends on what you want, their percentages change
[1:37:09] <+Kiaayo> gaijin hunter literally made a video about this
[1:37:10] <%hotcarl6872> some materials have better drop rates for capture though
[1:37:11] <Blank9> It's a higher percentage, but less chances usually.
[1:37:16] <+datmegamandeeeee> You want sacs? Carve
[1:37:26] <%AncelDeLambert> just that killing increases your chances
[1:37:30] <+Kiaayo> super wrong
[1:37:37] <%AncelDeLambert> capturing speeds up the hunt
[1:37:51] <%JumboCrunchies> Thats not true any more. Capture kills % on a lot of drops now.
[1:37:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> unless you eat the carve dango
[1:37:55] <+McDerpus> nargacuga is a big exception to that, carve drops are better than capture
[1:37:56] <DusK_The_Stray> But you are this time.
[1:37:56] <%AncelDeLambert> sometimes five minutes of your life is more important than a 10% chance on carve
[1:37:56] <%luftraumm1> super right
[1:37:58] <%JumboCrunchies> It was true that MHW worked that way though
[1:37:59] <PyroDrag> So when does crazy talk activate here?
[1:38:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:38:05] <iosephe> stando power
[1:38:06] <Ris_Eltrut> Capturing is for nerds tho
[1:38:08] <%solracc25> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand
[1:38:08] <%bevyrage> the deal with capturing is it removes time spent being able to secure more breaks, drops, etc that and you only get two rewards on cap now instead of 3 carves.
[1:38:15] <BiologicGases> youre wrong because they want to kill
[1:38:15] <Theoyveyman> Killing means there's more game to play, so it's more fun
[1:38:15] <d_man303> pat is right tho
[1:38:16] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:38:16] <+Das_Prints> Capturing only gets you two drops in this one while carves get you three.
[1:38:23] <penitentpendant> "Fight my pretties!"
[1:38:24] <krnksk> NotLikeThis
[1:38:25] <DusK_The_Stray> Literally no one is arguing.
[1:38:28] <UnfilteredComic> Carve Gang
[1:38:29] <+Kiaayo> i trust gaijin hunter a million times more than pat
[1:38:33] <%superc37> no pats wrong
[1:38:33] <cherrycottontail> @bevyrage untrue, you can get 3 or more
[1:38:36] <Blank9> You can check hunter notes for items you want.
[1:38:36] <Oxybe> Capture gives one less drop then kill upon end and some drops are kill only.
[1:38:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DusK_The_Stray I'll argue that
[1:38:42] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, we have a emote for it psaWrong
[1:38:45] <cherrycottontail> @Das_Prints untrue
[1:38:46] <d_man303> capture with fortunate set bonus
[1:38:51] <+Minorou> the true captures were the carves we got along the way
[1:38:52] <%AzureGale> F
[1:38:52] <thatlolifrompersona1> Just read the percentages on drop rates in the book
[1:38:59] <%JumboCrunchies> You can see drop rates in your Hunter journal, Pat. It'll show what we mean.
[1:38:59] <Blank9> he can just join midquest
[1:39:00] <iosephe> Yeah, they can just join
[1:39:00] <+athuramn> he used 18 hours of life to send you that info
[1:39:02] <+Dorf1> people who default to capture will not survive the day of the rake
[1:39:02] <BlueSpartan119> yeah you can join mid quest
[1:39:04] <+ArtemisCroc> carving is better if you want more lower tier parts, capturing is better if you want rarer parts
[1:39:06] <+datmegamandeeeee> Look in your hunter notes. It just changes percentages
[1:39:07] <%averyoddjew> yes
[1:39:09] <+ArtemisCroc> it's that simple
[1:39:10] <PyroDrag> you can just join
[1:39:11] <%YakumoYomi> You can join midquest, so no worries
[1:39:13] <+Ondartyr> You really shouldn't capture all the time any more. Carving gives more drop chances and way higher chances for some materials depending on the monster. Good luck getting Nargacuga's.. Brainstem thingy from capturing.
[1:39:15] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> K I L L
[1:39:22] <%bevyrage> @cherrycottontail that's only if you eat the dango that gives you more rewards, or have the lucky charm skill
[1:39:25] <Equirah> there's stuff that you simply cannot get by capture, there's others that have reduced chance others still have increased chance and finally some can only be gotten by capturing. all in all it depends on what you want
[1:39:26] <BlueSpartan119> SOS flare is functionally still a thing
[1:39:28] <wolfen091> pat your fucking wrong... now what are we discussing?
[1:39:30] <+datmegamandeeeee> You can join midquest
[1:39:31] <Oxybe> Kill with fortunate and double gatherer palicos, search your feelings, you know it to be true!
[1:39:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt g is when they stop
[1:39:39] <%hotcarl6872> carving gets you more materials in general
[1:39:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's almost like there's a definitive resource in the actual video game that outright tells you what your chances are getting something with carving/breaking/capture. Naw, that can't exist. That's a fairy tail.
[1:39:41] <cherrycottontail> @bevyrage I've gotten 3 without either.
[1:39:44] <%Monkeyweed21> thats always true pat
[1:39:44] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:39:58] <+Celarious> big big chungus
[1:40:00] <cherrycottontail> @bevyrage it's just 100% super wrong
[1:40:06] <%BoxNavy> hunters notes
[1:40:14] <+Celarious> big chungus big chungus
[1:40:14] <+Ondartyr> You can look at them whenever
[1:40:20] <+RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[1:40:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Today we've learned who in chat never reads the Hunter Notes.
[1:40:28] <+athuramn> very big chungus
[1:40:30] <BlueSpartan119> Hunter's notes, materials tab
[1:40:50] <SovPho> honey habanero pork loin chop oh yeah
[1:40:53] <Zeif00> I got through the game so fast I never fought Lagombi until after the "ending"
[1:40:59] <+ArtemisCroc> hunter notes were great in GU too
[1:41:03] <%hotcarl6872> certain materials only come from carves
[1:41:04] <+athuramn> this is some weird animal cruelty
[1:41:14] <PyroDrag> Go lagombi! Use Slam!
[1:41:14] <%blaggablag> Hunter notes literally look like the kiraniko chart now
[1:41:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, there is A LOT of information to internalize in this video game. Like this is my first Monster Hunter and holy fucking shit.
[1:41:24] <+datmegamandeeeee> Hunter notes has everything now. Its great
[1:41:32] <%Alazull> New Longsword is amazing
[1:41:38] <%Alazull> Makes World look childish
[1:41:38] <BiologicGases> Lamborghini
[1:41:41] <%Monkeyweed21> use the Iai sheath pat
[1:41:41] <+Kenzo2000> LS should be banned fight me
[1:41:46] <+datmegamandeeeee> New everything owns
[1:41:46] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Reading is for nerds, only go off previous knowledge doodCrazy
[1:41:48] <EynosStyles> So, what are those orange boxes by the monster parts in the notes?
[1:41:49] <Nordguy> how abouts the gunlance?
[1:41:50] <+McDerpus> there are literally 0 things that only come from carves, just things that don't come from captures
[1:41:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm a weirdo who uses the Hammer.
[1:41:55] <SovPho> @CommanderSqueaks It's a lot but it's also not that much. You get used to it is what I'm saying, especially when you start making loadouts for specific monsters.
[1:41:57] <Theoyveyman> It seems very similar to old longsword
[1:41:57] <%charp35> longsword mains are the same as blank mains
[1:42:00] <+Ondartyr> Yeah, MonHun has a ton of information and the game is GARBAGE at conveying any of it
[1:42:07] <MoonKing> Quick sheathe works on the iai moves now and it makes LS stupidly good
[1:42:12] <Blank9> LS is not nearly as good as people act like it is
[1:42:14] <blaggablag> It's less garbage now
[1:42:29] <$Afterman_> LS has THE FASTEST speed run
[1:42:32] <%AncelDeLambert> who gives a shit, my weeb is strong
[1:42:32] <Blank9> That's what I mean
[1:42:33] <PyroDrag> LS is getting top clear times right now
[1:42:33] <$Afterman_> so its actuallyt very good
[1:42:34] <+Sharmanyx> Wow that sounds like Liam
[1:42:34] <sirtommygunn> i love the shiny arcs on the longsword moves
[1:42:35] <PyroDrag> who said that?
[1:42:35] <rekinom> (It's also the fastest weapon in terms of speedruns, that person is just wrong)
[1:42:38] <%blaggablag> MH3U started you BLIND
[1:42:38] <TheLucidChiba> hammer is really strong/fun in Rise, big fan
[1:42:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's how I feel about the hammer. I don't care about its tier, I love knocking monsters on their ass.
[1:42:42] <%valriot> LS is the best speedrun? lmao
[1:42:42] <SovPho> if you want to be meta use heavy bowgun and then have 0 fun the entire game
[1:42:43] <%BoxNavy> at the end of the day all the weapons are good
[1:42:45] <sirtommygunn> extremely anime aesthetic
[1:42:46] <Blank9> people act like everyone is going to use it for tierlists
[1:42:47] <Equirah> that guy is super wrong LUL
[1:42:48] <Saltmeisterr> one guy
[1:42:50] <%yendoria> There is no way that people are sayiong longsword isn't busted in Rise
[1:42:54] <+athuramn> whoa
[1:42:55] <%AncelDeLambert> LS utilizes draw skills SUPER WELL
[1:42:59] <+RealPT1> as a Lance main, LS hate is largely justified
[1:42:59] <SovPho> o n e g u y
[1:42:59] <$Afterman_> @valriot im fairly certain, check r/monsterhuntermeta
[1:43:02] <Mattais88> Big numbers are fun though
[1:43:05] <+datmegamandeeeee> Weapon gatekeeping is cool tho
[1:43:06] <DianaTheAscian> people really trying tier list weapons LUL
[1:43:06] <+mechslayer71> It’s freakishly strong who is that idiot?
[1:43:10] <krnksk> @SovPho I've only ever used heavy bowgun in this game and I'm having fun
[1:43:11] <dan_g_v> how hard did he hit it?
[1:43:11] <+Neku054> LBG* HBG is redundant now kinda
[1:43:16] <BlueSpartan119> I had trouble using Rise LS for a bit since it's more deliberate and less spammy
[1:43:16] <EynosStyles> "Its not optimal!!" those are words spoken by Pat
[1:43:18] <%luftraumm1> dont play MH but it seems way more interested in being fun than being effective, meta or competitive
[1:43:27] <%Monkeyweed21> lol pat doesnt use the Iai sheath
[1:43:27] <+datmegamandeeeee> How dare you like “thing”?
[1:43:28] <Warbot40> Who cares unless your speed running and even then CATAGORIES MAN
[1:43:28] <fairore> i enjoy buzzaw charge blade mmmm
[1:43:28] <%hotcarl6872> if you just internalize a little at a time it's not too bad, it's when you try to understand every mechanic at once that people get overwhelmed
[1:43:28] <+Celarious> The only thing I dislike about Long Sword is that when you use Helmbreaker it takes a level of spirit immediately so you can't anime slash them with a cool glowing red sword
[1:43:30] <TheLucidChiba> The only fair gatekeeping is against hunters who trip non-stop
[1:43:30] <derangedoutcast> Im just mad your character isnt speaking monster hunter language
[1:43:33] <+athuramn> how far this game has come since the 3ds
[1:43:38] <rekinom> @Blank9 LS currently has the fastest speedrun times, so, I'm not sure what the hell you're talking about?
[1:43:40] <+RealPT1> even if they took out friendly knockback the history remains
[1:43:40] <sirtommygunn> ELMO
[1:43:40] <Theoyveyman> YEYEYEYE
[1:43:40] <SovPho> @luftraumm1 there are literally joke weapons that are technically viable so
[1:43:44] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I don't mind if LS gets nerfed or whatever, still my favourite weapon
[1:43:45] <SovPho> The start of it
[1:43:45] <%AncelDeLambert> they REALLY need to patch the buddies to STOP FIGHTING the second the monster sleeps
[1:43:51] <ASleepySnek> swing back
[1:43:53] <%BoxNavy> swing back
[1:43:54] <SovPho> Swing back + a little after.
[1:43:54] <%MugenSandan> Pat please initiate WEEB STANCE
[1:43:55] <+Onionchamp> Literally every weapon in the game is viable
[1:43:55] <%valriot> Swing back
[1:43:58] <+Tucker0603> back
[1:43:58] <TheFramedWarlock> The part where you swing back
[1:43:59] <PanicSwytch> Swing back
[1:43:59] <ASleepySnek> yes
[1:43:59] <%yendoria> swing back
[1:43:59] <morow1ec> swing back
[1:43:59] <BlueSpartan119> swing back
[1:43:59] <%AncelDeLambert> foresight is on the step-back
[1:44:00] <+DynDimAcsiwn> when you go back, the blue particles indicate the window
[1:44:01] <SovPho> Yes that part
[1:44:01] <%BoxNavy> yee
[1:44:02] <TheFramedWarlock> Yes
[1:44:03] <%Kaask> theres a training room to practice in
[1:44:06] <koffeemancer> Swing back
[1:44:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt see the blue? That's the i-frame
[1:44:08] <+Das_Prints> On the way backwards
[1:44:08] <%Monkeyweed21> during the swing back
[1:44:10] <$StrawberryPantsu> JUDGMENT CUTTER
[1:44:14] <+McDerpus> buddies literally cannot wake up monsters when they attack
[1:44:16] <+mechslayer71> When you step back
[1:44:16] <zanderwitch42> can this game be Monster Hunter All Stars
[1:44:18] <fairore> i love weeb stance
[1:44:19] <+AWr00tBear> Swing back
[1:44:19] <SovPho> weeb stance is like... objectively better foresight I guess
[1:44:19] <%valriot> and the sheathe one, you hit it when your HIT
[1:44:20] <Blank9> @Blank9 Most people aren't TA speedrunners. Even those people have differences of like 1 minute between bottom and top weapons.
[1:44:38] <TheLucidChiba> Dog is nice to get around but Palicos do sooo much
[1:44:38] <+polothegreatest> vergil dlc when?
[1:44:40] <koffeemancer> you want to be hit during the blue effect essentially
[1:44:47] <+Neku054> @AncelDeLambert Buddies cant wake up monsters, other monsters and other hunters yes but not palicos or palamutes. not from what ive seen
[1:44:48] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @mcderpus That's wrong
[1:44:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @McDerpus that's not true at all, I've been on solo hunts and they've woken the bastard
[1:44:58] <$Afterman_> HERE ARE THE SPEEDRUN RANKINGS: LS>GS>HH>SA>LBG>Bow>GL>Hammer>HBG>S&S>IG>CB>DB>Lance
[1:45:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I made the mistake of naming the Doggo after my Doggo so I can never get rid of them because my soul would hurt.
[1:45:05] <Equirah> 290 = 300 Kappa
[1:45:09] <%Agami23> the weird umbrella yokai thing, right?
[1:45:10] <+datmegamandeeeee> Dont
[1:45:10] <SulfurousAcid> which game was it that had the dmc quests
[1:45:10] <+McDerpus> nope. small monsters can, but buddies cannot
[1:45:13] <dan_g_v> Karakasa?
[1:45:14] <BlueSpartan119> you can also you fade slash (X+A) to skip the first 2 attacks of the spirit combo
[1:45:14] <sirtommygunn> close enough
[1:45:19] <+datmegamandeeeee> Who cares
[1:45:22] <%BoxNavy> birds do do that
[1:45:23] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, I've literally SEEN IT
[1:45:30] <dan_g_v> The Touhou girl
[1:45:30] <+Dorf1> the dog can wake up monsters if you are trying the true charge slash setup
[1:45:33] <+athuramn> it's behaviour akin to rats not swimming
[1:45:36] <PyroDrag> Kusotori Kappa
[1:45:40] <Theoyveyman> EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS JAPAN
[1:45:42] <+McDerpus> I don't believe you
[1:45:46] <%BigDumBeak> bigdum1Wave bigdum1Blushy i heard the word flamingo
[1:45:51] <Blank9> There's sub-5 minute HR magnamalo speedruns with lance lol
[1:45:52] <+Neku054> Same
[1:45:56] <Blank9> the tier lists mean nothing
[1:45:56] <%AncelDeLambert> the riding meter isn't quite long enough
[1:45:58] <+McDerpus> literally every time they do it for me, monster stays asleep
[1:46:00] <sirtommygunn> perfect mount
[1:46:00] <dan_g_v> everything is a Touhou reference
[1:46:02] <+HodouVAN> kasa-okabe is the umbrella yokai karakusa is a popular japanese line pattern karukasa is nothing
[1:46:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> @anceldelambert You're super right, it's happened so many times during hunts it's mad annoying
[1:46:08] <+Neku054> ive seen my palamute go crazy on a sleeping monster and not waking it up
[1:46:09] <+D00msDayDan> wow iai slash gives way less free focus in this game
[1:46:14] <$Afterman_> @Blank9  go look at the monsterhuntermeta on reddit
[1:46:14] <SovPho> Magnum Dongo is a legit fun fight
[1:46:22] <$Afterman_> @Blank9 thats where the info is compiled
[1:46:31] <%cvp5127> DansGame
[1:46:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dual swords have no chill.
[1:46:41] <+skeletonmilk> what's the chad level of a switch axe?
[1:46:56] <+projectmanatees> Very high
[1:47:02] <+Dorf1> @Neku054 where they using gear or where they attacks that you triggered by attacking, gear attacks dont wake them up
[1:47:02] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a LONG window on the monster sleeping
[1:47:07] <SovPho> a little under lance, a little over greatsword
[1:47:09] <%VioletHeart> Moderate to high.
[1:47:09] <%BoxNavy> status DBs seems fun :)
[1:47:16] <Manwad> force multiplayer for someone else
[1:47:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I play LS as if I was playing Valor style with the counter
[1:47:27] <+ArtemisCroc> even if it wakes up right away it still gives you a bunch of free hits right?
[1:47:32] <Blank9> Why bother checking data when it's differences of like 1-2 minutes in the 100th try of the same hunt?
[1:47:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, where are your fish
[1:47:36] <+skeletonmilk> are dual blades the least chad?
[1:47:43] <SovPho> how fucking dare you
[1:47:46] <%cvp5127> use your doggo to sharpen
[1:47:49] <%VioletHeart> Longsword is the least chad.
[1:47:58] <%luftraumm1> why does Pat's longsword have double tsubas? what a weird design
[1:48:00] <$Afterman_> @Blank9  because we are discussing speed runs, obviously it matters lol.
[1:48:00] <%MugenSandan> hashtag GOTTEM psaDab psaDab
[1:48:01] <SovPho> Longsword is so weeb that it's sigma male
[1:48:02] <%BoxNavy> every weapon in this game is chad wym
[1:48:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, how do you not have a full inventory of whetfish smh my head
[1:48:04] <%hotcarl6872> GS is the best
[1:48:04] <Mattais88> Sword and sheild
[1:48:07] <ScreamLord> Worst idea for a new monster ever. An Alatreon Variant that uses Status Effects instead of Elements
[1:48:07] <normalcygaming> no then you get to do the one big double damage wakeup attack
[1:48:07] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Can you tell your friends to get off Great Swords dick for me?
[1:48:13] <Ris_Eltrut> @skeletonmilk no thats every ranged weapon
[1:48:13] <+mechslayer71> Wake up hits
[1:48:13] <Blank9> most chad is kunai only
[1:48:15] <MoonKing> Sleep GS is great when you ahve 4 people doing it. same for sleep CB
[1:48:21] <%BoxNavy> @SovPho you know what. yeah.
[1:48:23] <+skeletonmilk> wait are WEEB and CHAD polar opposites?
[1:48:28] <+Dorf1> sleep greatsword is the best status to go for on a greatsword, if someone was forcing you to go status on a greatsword i guess
[1:48:36] <+McDerpus> @screamlord a Malboro
[1:48:37] <+Celarious> Dual Blades are pretty chad for being the best element and status user
[1:48:41] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear, that thing misses every time
[1:48:42] <+datmegamandeeeee> Dual blades literally naruto run in demon mode
[1:48:47] <fuchard1996> Woolie just nutted somewhere
[1:48:50] <+athuramn> there's a bull crowd for moral support
[1:48:50] <+datmegamandeeeee> DB is most weeb
[1:48:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Serene Pose just never feels like it connects
[1:48:51] <$Afterman_> @Celarious they are the best in general tbh
[1:49:09] <sirtommygunn> surprised this bird isn't capturable yet
[1:49:10] <dan_g_v> the goodest!
[1:49:15] <SovPho> Actually using longsword is the difference between talking about anime in public and unironically wearing a kimono to the coffee shop
[1:49:16] <+athuramn> *everywhere
[1:49:17] <hazzy_o7> You can
[1:49:22] <%BoxNavy> you can foresight roars idk about the counter
[1:49:29] <%Xevtes> you can counter roars
[1:49:44] <SovPho> You can weeb after spirit round
[1:49:45] <Blank9> the silkibind counter scales damage based off what hits you, so not great for roars
[1:49:46] <$Afterman_> just roll through the roar Kappa
[1:49:50] <Blank9> can do it but no damage
[1:49:54] <%MugenSandan> Y-you guys don't wear a kimono at home!?
[1:50:03] <hazzy_o7> Parry the roar with your hammer.
[1:50:04] <ScreamLord> You can weeb stance out of the final hit of your SPirit Combo
[1:50:09] <%hamborgini> use a small barrel bomb to trigger serene pose on a sleeping monster for psaBig damage
[1:50:10] <PyroDrag> remember this is a capture mission!
[1:50:15] <SovPho> Home is home, public is where your mettle is tested
[1:50:18] <Blank9> But if you like, counter magnamalo's divebomb, just good god it's incredible
[1:50:19] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:50:24] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> rekt
[1:50:25] <%AncelDeLambert> god, doing spirit iai counter on a roar always feel SO good
[1:50:26] <Mattais88> Counter breaker
[1:50:41] <PyroDrag> GGs
[1:50:41] <Theoyveyman> Did they make Behemoth/Safi enmity a normal mechanic in this game?
[1:50:42] <%Monkeyweed21> they should give HH a counter move
[1:50:44] <%BoxNavy> double tranqed up on a thursday afternoon
[1:50:47] <SovPho> DON'T LIKE YOUR FRIENDS
[1:50:49] <hazzy_o7> Countering roars in general feel good
[1:50:51] <dan_g_v> ez gg nore
[1:51:07] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:51:08] <+athuramn> back to the village guys
[1:51:09] <%AncelDeLambert> ....
[1:51:10] <Blank9> HH does have a super armor move now with sonic barrier song
[1:51:11] <%BoxNavy> sure
[1:51:11] <SovPho> weird flex but okay
[1:51:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do not CBT to your dog, Pat
[1:51:13] <%valriot> WHY
[1:51:14] <%luftraumm1> this victory theme bops
[1:51:15] <+Onionchamp> If you’ve fully upgraded your low rank armor it’ll actually have more defense than some of the base high rank armor
[1:51:23] <dan_g_v> he said the thing!
[1:51:24] <%AncelDeLambert> bird is the word
[1:51:26] <Sol_Install> ok weird flex but ok
[1:51:26] <%MugenSandan> BIRD UP
[1:51:26] <%shurtal> the WORST show on television
[1:51:28] <sirtommygunn> noice
[1:51:32] <Saltmeisterr> bird up
[1:51:34] <EternalJedi> rooVV BIRD UP
[1:51:34] <%General_Terro> bird up

[1:51:55] <%BoxNavy> all of sns's new moves are so cool
[1:52:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Eric Andre is peak cringe.
[1:52:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> In a good way
[1:52:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Eric Andre freaks me out with his shit
[1:52:10] <sirtommygunn> NFTs are over
[1:52:11] <+projectmanatees> Worst show on tv
[1:52:14] <Blank9> SHORYUGEKI
[1:52:17] <Ipsenscastle> i can't watch it, it makes my skin feel bad haha
[1:52:20] <Blank9> this is the coolest shit
[1:52:23] <%MugenSandan> METSU
[1:52:27] <+sharpened_hammer> Can't it though?
[1:52:28] <BlueSpartan119> :)
[1:52:28] <%Paperware> It's really good but hard to pull off right
[1:52:29] <dan_g_v> it's a tatsu
[1:52:29] <Blank9> if you counter, it does the extra spin too
[1:52:32] <PyroDrag> IT IS
[1:52:33] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> it sure is
[1:52:33] <+datmegamandeeeee> Shoryu
[1:52:33] <$Xevtes> it totally is
[1:52:34] <mybigmeech> Oh cool it's the uppercut from mhgu
[1:52:37] <EternalJedi> or can it
[1:52:38] <+datmegamandeeeee> Ko
[1:52:39] <%hrbeck_> Pat is GS traitor
[1:52:39] <dan_g_v> dragon punch!
[1:52:41] <%JumboCrunchies> Hit X or A on the way down to follow up
[1:52:43] <%BoxNavy> its a counter
[1:52:45] <%charp35> it does more damage if it is a counter hit
[1:52:46] <Namillus> It's the Hunter Art from MHG
[1:52:46] <bonebagMEL> Tghat's just a dragon punch
[1:52:47] <dan_g_v> when do we get a haoken?
[1:52:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, the training area shows you your combos?... I literally have not used the training area yet.
[1:52:48] <%JumboCrunchies> A with a Shield Bash, X with a slash
[1:52:49] <mybigmeech> It also counters
[1:52:50] <%MugenSandan> Reggie confirmed SnS main
[1:52:51] <%BestTeaMaker> BEST COUNTER MOVE
[1:52:51] <EternalJedi> SURE YOU CAN
[1:52:53] <PyroDrag> I bet it KOs like a motherhecker
[1:52:53] <%discordlord45> discordlord45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:52:55] <koffeemancer> It sure fucking is LUL
[1:52:55] <UnfilteredComic> Its a parry shoryu
[1:52:59] <+Das_Prints> You can attack on the way down too
[1:53:00] <+D00msDayDan> X+A when you launch into the air
[1:53:01] <Theoyveyman> Wasn't there something similar in World?
[1:53:04] <%BoxNavy> magnamalos sns is so nice
[1:53:12] <UnfilteredComic> set to infinite wire
[1:53:14] <SovPho> @CommanderSqueaks you should fix that
[1:53:22] <%valriot> It does extra hits as a Counter
[1:53:23] <dan_g_v> gotta check the owl's nest
[1:53:33] <+skeletonmilk> a gang of cuties
[1:53:34] <+mechslayer71> It has a guard point
[1:53:35] <SovPho> it's how you learn your infinite combos and what stops combos from happening etc
[1:53:39] <+Tucker0603> it's a parry shoryu, it's crazier if you counter
[1:53:41] <%walternatorz> how can there be a palico better than elmo?
[1:53:41] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Check the shrine by the Meowcenaries
[1:53:44] <koffeemancer> World had a clutch claw shoryu yeah @Theoyveyman
[1:53:49] <Blank9> extra hits and spins like ken
[1:53:52] <Ipsenscastle> what are you looking for in a palico?
[1:53:54] <Mattais88> Did Pat grind out Magnamalo versions of every weapon?
[1:54:26] <dan_g_v> don't think so, he's happy with his big stocky sword
[1:54:36] <dan_g_v> oh he did!
[1:54:38] <sirtommygunn> get that carbalite
[1:54:42] <Dementedpenguin> bless
[1:54:44] <dan_g_v> bless yah
[1:54:52] <%YakumoYomi> くしゃみ助かる
[1:54:54] <krnksk> that was cute
[1:54:56] <%BoxNavy> mining stream lionDongers
[1:54:58] <sirtommygunn> im guessing you enjoy fighting Magnamalo then
[1:55:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> There are monsters that blast doesn't do shit at all
[1:55:04] <+datmegamandeeeee> Magnamalo theme rules
[1:55:04] <+skeletonmilk> i did the same with zora magdaros in MHW. blast weapons fucking rule
[1:55:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Question, for hammer, what's a good low-level set to grind out?
[1:55:24] <+datmegamandeeeee> Khezu is solid for hammer
[1:55:29] <+datmegamandeeeee> Lo rank
[1:55:35] <Blank9> Ore hammer is pretty good.
[1:55:41] <Theoyveyman> SAFI SHATTERBLADE
[1:55:42] <SovPho> your ding ding dango?
[1:55:44] <%hrbeck_> @CommanderSqueaks anything with Attack
[1:55:53] <+skeletonmilk> this song is so good
[1:55:54] <BiologicGases> wasnt hh nerfed from the demo on day 1 patch
[1:56:10] <%hrbeck_> Doesn't particularly matter, Low Rank armor is more or less tissue paper
[1:56:15] <dan_g_v> what?
[1:56:19] <FourthQueen> @PatStaresAt Did you know you can accept quests via the D-pad menu option? You dont even need to be in the Gathering Hall to do it
[1:56:27] <%shurtal> FUCKING HAMBURGERS
[1:56:27] <2DSuperiority> rub a dub dub thanks for the grub
[1:56:27] <+Celarious> @Mattais88 Magnamalo's gear works with all of his weapons so you can just make a way higher base weapon in case you ever want to try the weapon
[1:56:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EAT YOUR HAMBURGERS APOLLO
[1:56:28] <dan_g_v> Hamburgers, Apollo?
[1:56:28] <+Tucker0603> YESSSSSS
[1:56:30] <+Kiaayo> eat your hamburgers hunter
[1:56:31] <cherrycottontail> it's in monhun language anyway
[1:56:33] <+D00msDayDan> eat your hamburgers hunter
[1:56:36] <+red_cuppa> omg
[1:56:40] <%superc37> well its a song, changes are kinda necessary so that they rhyme
[1:56:41] <%weissguard> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:56:42] <+polothegreatest> yeaaah
[1:56:42] <%YakumoYomi> Delicious jelly donuts！
[1:56:47] <EternalJedi> LuL
[1:56:49] <%WhereIsWill> the cringe LUL
[1:56:57] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:56:58] <SovPho> @CommanderSqueaks Because there aren't a lot of pre-HR partbreaker sets, attack and sharpness are what you may want to focus on with a hammer. Affinity is also good, because you'll be focusing on a monster's head most of the time anyways you may as well be trying to crit.
[1:57:06] <+datmegamandeeeee> I want all capcom games to have monster hunter language patched in
[1:57:06] <EternalJedi> rooVV EAT YOUR HAMBURGERS APOLLO
[1:57:08] <+D00msDayDan> how well can you get around dogless using wirebugs?
[1:57:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> Kaiba redeems the 4kids dubs. Kind of.
[1:57:17] <+projectmanatees> How are Bluetooth headphones these days? T
[1:57:21] <%hrbeck_> Brock scored and the Ash won that league, it's such bullshit
[1:57:24] <+swid_harry> I love getting comfy in my traditional American Kotatsu
[1:57:25] <+BeeComfy> Be every souls game for the 1st time I think they are all amazing
[1:57:32] <%Agami23> wait
[1:57:35] <%Agami23> how did pat do that??
[1:57:45] <%Agami23> how does the mini map show the mining spots?
[1:57:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SovPho Would Slugger be a good skill, also?
[1:57:48] <+Neku054> you can change it so its always the zoomed in map in the options
[1:57:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> wait yeah how
[1:57:56] <Blank9> hold L and it'll zoom in the minimap
[1:57:57] <SovPho> Always
[1:58:06] <Srthunda> my favorite of those was in a digimon movie where they travel to a Japanese island that the Dub called "Colorado"
[1:58:32] <SovPho> There will be a point in the game where you probably start struggling to actually find ways to fill out your builds.
[1:58:38] <%BoxNavy> nice
[1:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> One more question, I've been focusing exclusive on Village quests right now instead of Hub. Is that a mistake?
[1:58:56] <+datmegamandeeeee> Just upgrade kamura weapons
[1:58:58] <2DSuperiority> I forgot what DS game it was but The subs said the game took place in Japan while the English VA said it took place in America
[1:59:07] <%Asagi66> Asagi66 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:59:14] <SovPho> It doesn't matter with the special licensing quests.
[1:59:16] <Blank9> nah, village quests let you skip straight to high rank hub if you do most of them
[1:59:22] <+datmegamandeeeee> Easy upgrade, better than lo rank
[1:59:31] <%Monkeyweed21> how long until Rajang invades
[1:59:33] <%BoxNavy> nintendo cant optimize their own games lol
[1:59:40] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @CommanderSqueaks nah, you can actually get to high rank hub if you do the village quests
[1:59:43] <SovPho> BUT you will not get ANY HR PARTS in village quests (from what I can tell)
[1:59:44] <+TheBitingIrish> KT thinks 10fps is optimal
[1:59:45] <%BoxNavy> you did
[1:59:48] <sirtommygunn> greatsword seems a lot more fun in multiplayer where your team can set you up and the monster doesn't just pop you out of your swing every three seconds
[1:59:51] <Blank9> I don't get how age of calamity is so bad when fire emblem warriors runs well
[1:59:53] <%blaggablag> the only calamity is they allowed them to release like that
[2:00:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @The_Forgotten_Alligator I think I just unlocked one of my first quests to do just that.
[2:00:01] <+ArtemisCroc> age of calamity isn't ddveloped by nintendo lmao
[2:00:02] <$RealThiele> im the madman that did couch coop 100%
[2:00:03] <dan_g_v> there is DLC incoming, so who knows
[2:00:03] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Re Engine is magic
[2:00:09] <TehMud> @BoxNavy Nintendo didn't make Age of Calamity. Omega did.
[2:00:24] <TehMud> RE Engine is witchcraft
[2:00:29] <%Monkeyweed21> sidon is best boy
[2:00:35] <Blank9> Pat, imagine it with coop going.
[2:00:53] <Theoyveyman> I love how bad the FPS is
[2:00:54] <generalve> lol at AOT
[2:01:00] <SovPho> Imagine an Elder Scrolls with the RE engine instead of the broken ass Gamebryo engine
[2:01:02] <TehMud> Age of Calamity is ROUGH.... but I did have fun playing it. It would be amazing if it had a decent FPS though.
[2:01:21] <generalve> this guy sounds like me and it's freaking me out
[2:01:21] <+Celarious> I still haven't found fox fren here yet FeelsBadMan
[2:01:29] <SovPho> mood
[2:01:35] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:01:36] <Srthunda> sounds fake to mer
[2:01:36] <Blank9> In coop it cuts enemy count to 20%, you can't actually kill enough enemies for higher ranks.
[2:01:42] <SovPho> I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
[2:01:42] <%BoxNavy> im not going to
[2:01:42] <+skeletonmilk> imagine elder scrolls with even partially fun gameplay
[2:01:47] <TehMud> But what even is Elder Scrolls without hundreds of bugs and glitches
[2:01:47] <generalve> yea
[2:01:52] <generalve> you
[2:01:54] <%BoxNavy> me
[2:01:55] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> imagine bethesda thinking about it
[2:01:56] <%shurtal> hopefully all that microsoft money will mean a new engine, one that can DO LADDERS
[2:01:56] <sirtommygunn> imagine an elder scrolls game with some effort put into it
[2:02:03] <Theoyveyman> Imagine TES in MT Framework
[2:02:06] <Ris_Eltrut> no me :)
[2:02:12] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, have you devoured all the content in the game yet?
[2:02:13] <+datmegamandeeeee> Puppet spider owns
[2:02:31] <SovPho> I think it's unfair to say that TES games have no effort etc. Game devs care a lot about their games. Go after their bosses instead.
[2:02:35] <TehMud> Though I am impressed Rise holds its own with four hunters, four dogs, and a bajillion particle effects on Switch.
[2:02:44] <Mattais88> RASHIDO
[2:02:49] <TehMud> Like I thought the Switch would've melted
[2:02:51] <+red_cuppa> has the Moves
[2:02:52] <Theoyveyman> NEW SHIT
[2:02:56] <%BoxNavy> the high rank glow up
[2:02:59] <$bootysteve> is this the start of high rank?
[2:03:01] <%Dementedpenguin> @sirtommygunn you're gonna play your Skyrim VR at full price and you're gonna like it. Kappa
[2:03:09] <+Noir_Valdr> RE Engine is literally magic
[2:03:12] <UnfilteredComic> Yeah high rank unlocks the secret moves
[2:03:13] <Blank9> I've had this game crash once, but it was in the hub after a quest ran terrible.
[2:03:17] <Blank9> No idea what caused it
[2:03:21] <+Celarious> Yeah all the monsters get new shit right away going into high rank
[2:03:23] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat my dog is a needy brat and is smothering me in love, despite being 60ILBS
[2:03:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Izuchi is definitely the most complicated "first monster" they've ever made
[2:03:29] <TehMud> However once I saw RE Engine I knew why. My toaster can run RE2 at a smooth 60 like what the hell
[2:03:44] <butthurtdave> I had it crash once after waking the system up from sleep, but I had already saved so no loss
[2:03:46] <Srthunda> I cannot wait for the PC port to come out as un-optimized as ever
[2:03:54] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Magnamalo gets crazy new moves in HR
[2:03:58] <dan_g_v> we need Max and his big hammer to break stuff
[2:04:12] <Theoyveyman> I like how Pat's armor set makes him constantly at risk of fucking exploding
[2:04:18] <%hrbeck_> I miss great Jaggi
[2:04:22] <%BoxNavy> kill moon2DEV
[2:04:25] <+datmegamandeeeee> HR Mizutsune is a problem
[2:04:35] <sirtommygunn> check those hunters notes
[2:04:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Hellfire would be cool if it didn't fucking stagger your teammates
[2:04:48] <SovPho> Mizu is a problem no matter what
[2:04:51] <+Noir_Valdr> welp Srthunda you at least got the name mentioned lol
[2:04:58] <Blank9> it would've been hilarious if the demo magnamalo was HR version
[2:04:59] <$bootysteve> this was my first time fighting khezu and boy do I not like how it looks
[2:05:02] <Theoyveyman> HE HITS HARD
[2:05:04] <SovPho> hate Mizu
[2:05:06] <Blank9> he was enough of a problem already
[2:05:06] <+ArtemisCroc> apex mizu is just frustrating
[2:05:09] <inpaladin> high rank magnamalo is juiced up
[2:05:13] <dan_g_v> so baller
[2:05:17] <sirtommygunn> Rathalos remains the monster that kills me the most
[2:05:18] <BlueSpartan119> and Mizu's the only 4th gen monster in the game
[2:05:21] <Theoyveyman> Zinogre is really easy even in HR
[2:05:27] <%hrbeck_> why Mizu so fucky?
[2:05:35] <+datmegamandeeeee> He does fatalis tier damage for your armor cieling. It’s rad
[2:05:37] <Oxybe> Getting sniped in midair while IG spinning by Mizu's Hydro Pump is not just embarassing, but frequent.
[2:05:37] <Blank9> rathalos got the biggest glowup
[2:05:45] <d_man303> apex misutsune is legit
[2:05:53] <+Catpurnicus> lol I got an ad for Patron Tequila before this stream
[2:05:58] <%BoxNavy> he fucking did
[2:05:59] <SovPho> Rathalos HR is nuts.
[2:06:02] <+Catpurnicus> they know
[2:06:05] <+ALazo> rathalos is less of an asshole now
[2:06:06] <moosemonkey397> oh man new rathalos is SO COOL
[2:06:06] <$bootysteve> Bishaten might be my favorite new monster
[2:06:06] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Dood Rathalos HR is faster now I swear
[2:06:11] <%BoxNavy> rath used to be so annoying but now hes really fun
[2:06:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Rathalos got 2-3 new attacks AND he doesn't fly as much. Win/win all around.
[2:06:15] <+datmegamandeeeee> @blank9 absolutely. He’s fresh
[2:06:19] <+ArtemisCroc> great baggi is a big improvement, mostly in its visuals lol
[2:06:23] <butthurtdave> Rajang also feels much approachable but still like a threat
[2:06:27] <%logoth_> MAKIN PROGRESS
[2:06:28] <tolloponik> that beam threw me for the biggest loop
[2:06:40] <+mechslayer71> Goss Harag is the best monster no problem
[2:06:41] <SovPho> I feel like Rajang lets me tickle his tail more than he used to
[2:06:41] <cherrycottontail> if by 'aces' you mean 'fuck you'
[2:06:44] <Mattais88> Get eaten
[2:06:46] <zanderwitch42> you can wire bug with the egg
[2:06:47] <0range_> all flying enemies also dont get rekt when blinded now
[2:06:52] <simplyvince15> Zinorge's theme got the biggest glow up
[2:06:59] <sirtommygunn> gotta escort the egg man
[2:07:00] <d_man303> you can wire bug with the egg
[2:07:03] <%BoxNavy> who is pat?
[2:07:04] <butthurtdave> I'm glad there's not as many flyers this time around
[2:07:05] <$bootysteve> Khezu's theme is the best Kappa
[2:07:06] <crocboyz> do you guys think if you screamed at a wall
[2:07:13] <DSD24> Oooo Pat's using Greatsword?
[2:07:13] <+datmegamandeeeee> I actually like somnocanth as best newbie. Such an odd monster
[2:07:13] <Theoyveyman> Except it's in MIDI
[2:07:37] <%Puhff> ROWENGE
[2:07:43] <%luftraumm1> been a while since pat went: "I'm pat"
[2:07:46] <$bootysteve> The shmovement in this game is so good
[2:07:47] <IminyourBase> BIG 85 DAMAGE
[2:07:59] <sirtommygunn> its so cool!
[2:08:00] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:08:01] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Wait did he refer to himself in third-person?
[2:08:04] <Saltmeisterr> its DA ORB
[2:08:06] <sirtommygunn> not very effective, but extremely cool
[2:08:06] <butthurtdave> I'm 100% certain Zam's coming back
[2:08:09] <Theoyveyman> NO
[2:08:15] <tolloponik> zamits are in so he's coming
[2:08:20] <Blank9> I want gobul back
[2:08:22] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Super Important Pro-Tip: Some monsters have parts that you can ONLY get from killing the monster for Carves. They'll have lower or 0% drops for Captures, Magnamalo Blades for example don't drop from caps
[2:08:23] <%Puhff> oh cool issa platypus
[2:08:26] <+datmegamandeeeee> Platypus zamtrios
[2:08:27] <simplyvince15> Zam and Tetsu need to come back
[2:08:31] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> probably in update
[2:08:33] <Theoyveyman> HE'S GONE LIKE ALL THE OTHER MH4U BOIS
[2:08:35] <+Tucker0603> who's zam again
[2:08:41] <DSD24> Big 308 damage
[2:08:46] <%BoxNavy> this is true
[2:08:48] <Ris_Eltrut> @tolloponik tell that to great jaggi
[2:08:56] <simplyvince15> Zamtrios, fat shark
[2:09:02] <inpaladin> I really hope we get zamtrios and agnaktor since we got zamites and uroktors
[2:09:05] <+datmegamandeeeee> MH4 is illegal. It never existed
[2:09:07] <sirtommygunn> just break its arms!
[2:09:14] <+Tucker0603> OH YEAH, ZAM ROCKS
[2:09:17] <%JumboCrunchies> I think its mostly due to people online REFUSING to kill.
[2:09:20] <DusK_The_Stray> Pat, the point is that capturing just isn't always the best way of getting materials
[2:09:21] <Daniel_Is_I> Plates and gems are still most likely to come from caps so CAP CAP CAP
[2:09:21] <%Treuan> Between Zam Tetsu and Jagras this game loves inflating cold blooded mammals
[2:09:23] <DusK_The_Stray> You said it was, it's not.
[2:09:24] <butthurtdave> Hey  killing is more fun
[2:09:25] <GigaSeifer> sound like... maybe... Chat is the real monster
[2:09:25] <%logoth_> Pat, you dont like using consumables.
[2:09:29] <Bustahhwulf> caps is faster just do it
[2:09:30] <%Agami23> tranq bombs are a pain
[2:09:30] <%Alazull> Truth
[2:09:32] <dan_g_v> it's almost like these people don't know there is a chart with detailed information of each drop, part, etc
[2:09:32] <DSD24> Big Zam was cool in Gundam
[2:09:32] <%yendoria> I want to kill the monster, actually.
[2:09:33] <mike2hands> i just turn off my brain and kill monster for big armor over and over again
[2:09:36] <tolloponik> @Ris_Eltrut true
[2:09:39] <CappuccinoGuil> okay, but why would you capture a monster? Legit question
[2:09:39] <cherrycottontail> yes, that's right
[2:09:41] <+Noir_Valdr> I mean in World it WAS actually better to cap every single time
[2:09:44] <Srthunda> I like to use traps to deal more damage to kill
[2:09:48] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat okay but what if I just love violence
[2:09:49] <+Noir_Valdr> that's no longer the case in Rise
[2:09:49] <+ArtemisCroc> or maybe they just want more less rare parts because they're farming for specific gear?
[2:09:49] <%BoxNavy> killing is more fun moon2DEV
[2:09:50] <%valriot> Big Zam was clearly intended to be in the game, same with Tetsucabra, but covid probably fucked the ability to add them at launch
[2:09:51] <SovPho> HOLY SHIT THAT'S A BIG FUCKIN BOY
[2:09:51] <butthurtdave> Were tranq bombs purchaseable in World?
[2:09:53] <+yourevilredux> capturing is just so anticlimactic tho
[2:09:56] <Mattais88> I run out of tranqs before traps
[2:09:57] <Oxybe> I have trapmaking on my quickwheel
[2:09:58] <vVAstrAVv> noone REMEMBERS traps you just put them in all your loadouts
[2:10:04] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:10:05] <gnarly_memes_bro> @cappuccinoguil research
[2:10:05] <%Monkeyweed21> True monster hunters ARE traps
[2:10:06] <+Tucker0603> I always try and cap
[2:10:06] <BiologicGases> true hunters only bring traps against elder dragons
[2:10:06] <simplyvince15> all I need is Tesucabre and Gore/Sharu Magala and im good
[2:10:07] <dan_g_v> that was very cool
[2:10:09] <%yendoria> Also using traps as dps tools is the REAL tech
[2:10:09] <%MisterRockett> Who carries the max amount of high potions, potions, AND honey so you essentially have 20 high potions?
[2:10:11] <mike2hands> im so a monster hunter i'm still using cold and warm drinks in rise
[2:10:11] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I even spam "Do not capture" when I'm host lookin for a specific part and there's always the one guy that doesn't listen lol
[2:10:11] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I actually learned that from GaijinHunter. In World it didn't really matter which you did
[2:10:11] <sirtommygunn> this poor fat turtle man
[2:10:17] <DusK_The_Stray> The point being that capturing isn't the best way to get materials every time.
[2:10:33] <$realm_forge> Pat you have to hit it
[2:10:42] <%AzureGale> @MisterRockett Me
[2:10:47] <$bootysteve> you can drive it to a wall with r tho
[2:10:51] <%cvp5127> why doesnt pat use the down thrust
[2:10:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @gnarly_memes_bro that does not really answer my question, I'm not too well-versed in MH.
[2:10:53] <ronyoshi> rate is still higher in slay. I don't like trapping. so eat shit with your "bad hunter" nonsense
[2:11:09] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Amateur rider Kappa
[2:11:15] <%gitgouda> LUL
[2:11:22] <gnarly_memes_bro> @cappuccinoguil ok. because its faster than killing it
[2:11:25] <DusK_The_Stray> I mean, it's okay to be wrong, Pat.
[2:11:29] <+datmegamandeeeee> You’re not a TRUE monster hunter unless you log 10k hours on ps2 monster hunter whilst defeating white fatalis on a psp with a claw and have a tattoo that says “MHW sux”
[2:11:30] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett High five!
[2:11:32] <Oxybe> lul
[2:11:37] <%Treuan> On the subject of capping for mats I wish Volvidon dropped Para sacks more often. I'm locked on so many weapons
[2:11:39] <dan_g_v> fun beats everything
[2:11:42] <%gitgouda> thats the best part
[2:11:46] <cherrycottontail> It'sd a shame that pat is 100% right
[2:11:47] <%Agami23> how do you do the spin in the air for more distance in the air after a wirebug?
[2:11:48] <Blank9> the goal is to trick other hunters into a sense of safety, so that they take off their Flinchfree gem
[2:11:50] <sirtommygunn> the real monster hunter meta is the fun we had along the way
[2:11:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @gnarly_memes_bro that's a very reasonable motive, actually
[2:11:57] <BiologicGases> if you dont want to capture then play solo
[2:11:57] <butthurtdave> I usually kill because I try and break everything on the monster and LSers refuse to go for the tail
[2:12:01] <DSD24> @Agami23 Press B
[2:12:02] <Blank9> and then you switch axe, LS, bowgun
[2:12:03] <%ABakedDemon> Cmon pat, you used to be called angriestpat :)
[2:12:05] <dan_g_v> double grab!
[2:12:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @Agami23 roll button
[2:12:08] <%cvp5127> vored
[2:12:19] <krnksk> KomodoHype Mess with the croc KomodoHype You get the glock 🔫 KomodoHype
[2:12:19] <sirtommygunn> ground pound
[2:12:32] <dan_g_v> break the everything
[2:12:35] <butthurtdave> head, tummy, both arms
[2:12:36] <+Ondartyr> Capturing only becomes an issue because there's ALWAYS someone who captures which makes farming a bunch of mats take way longer.
[2:12:38] <%Monkeyweed21> A real monster hunter complains about whetstones being infinite now and says that its dumbing down and westernizing the game
[2:12:43] <%ABakedDemon> psaUp
[2:12:45] <dan_g_v> that head looks painful
[2:12:59] <ScreamLord> I'm love to see a Turf War between Terry the Platypus and Big Zam. It's look like to water balloons trying to kill each other
[2:13:00] <DSD24> @Monkeyweed21 Also that Cold and Hot drinks were great
[2:13:08] <Theoyveyman> I'm super hyped for Apex Rathalos /s
[2:13:21] <Blank9> A real monster hunter complains that not drinking a cold drink makes going into a volcano not immersive.
[2:13:25] <fairore> @Monkeyweed21 did somebody really say that ?
[2:13:26] <DusK_The_Stray> Not in World
[2:13:31] <%JumboCrunchies> It wasnt really the case in World, which has caused the issue.
[2:13:33] <DusK_The_Stray> In World it was always best to capture.
[2:13:35] <$scifimisc> Not in world Pat
[2:13:37] <butthurtdave> You need to cap for arena anyway dont you?
[2:13:37] <%NastiCrimeboy> psaUp
[2:13:39] <+Noir_Valdr> World was weird in which capturing was ALWAYS better
[2:13:45] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not even that it's more pronounced, it's that they finally put the info in the game so you don't have to look up a wiki
[2:13:45] <dan_g_v> now we have the hard numbers ingame so there's that
[2:13:46] <TehMud> I didn't know killing was better for some parts
[2:13:47] <BiologicGases> is apex rath in the dlc?
[2:13:49] <+Noir_Valdr> but all others, yeah
[2:13:52] <%Agami23> and 11 of those games no one played
[2:13:54] <rasamune> @Monkeyweed21 consumable whetstones aren't even realistic lmao
[2:13:56] <mybigmeech> It wasn't the case in freedom unite Kappa
[2:13:58] <Bustahhwulf> wrong some gems were only from carves and not caps in worl d
[2:13:59] <EynosStyles> that's not true
[2:14:00] <+ArtemisCroc> pat the problem is the majority of all monster players started with world lol
[2:14:02] <sirtommygunn> yeah but world is the first one for most people
[2:14:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @fairore Demolition D said that
[2:14:09] <@Mechz71> That's the most recent game tho
[2:14:11] <Skyjet24_> in the case of Rise, you get 2 items for capturing, 3 with killing, but some items are only available through either options
[2:14:13] <sirtommygunn> well, not most, but a lot
[2:14:14] <%AgniBrandt> In all fairness a LOT of people started with World.
[2:14:21] <$realm_forge> Killing the monster gets me off so fuck your hippie shit
[2:14:22] <EynosStyles> director literally said there was no difference in interview
[2:14:22] <%MugenSandan> I started with World, that's why I'm a Long Sword main psaDogchamp
[2:14:23] <+Ondartyr> You get one mat less for capturing, still
[2:14:25] <valk98> All these World only nerds smh. they don't know about the old waya
[2:14:29] <josemoya95> Its a hot topic in the community where some insist that the host should choose cap or kill, or try to communicate what they want, but its complicated when dealing with randoms
[2:14:32] <%Deft_Thought> Man, some real woolieONEGUY moments
[2:14:33] <IminyourBase> that's how pat shimmies his way to the bathroom
[2:14:36] <IminyourBase> carrying his poop
[2:14:41] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:14:42] <butthurtdave> I'm still not sure how I feel about the changes to Mind's Eye and Guard Up tbh
[2:14:45] <%logoth_> he takes a log of shit and rolls it at you
[2:14:46] <KasiCrafter> Imagine the MH most people started with was the one that was the best selling game the company ever put out. Imagine.
[2:14:48] <BlueSpartan119> @BiologicGases Apex Rathalos is TU1, Apex Rathian is already in the game
[2:14:49] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but that's one item less for three to five minutes less combat
[2:14:50] <%logoth_> take the trap back
[2:14:51] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> should I play Generations ultimate like right now
[2:14:51] <dan_g_v> aww, it's like his cousin Tetsucabra
[2:14:56] <%BubbaRands> Killing the Monster makes me feel like I have a big penis okay?!
[2:14:59] <tolloponik> stink mink
[2:15:04] <%President_Miyazaki> Only a bad hunter misses their trap.
[2:15:05] <Equirah> @Skyjet24_ are you not counting the capture specific rewards? cause capture will always give more rewards even if less chances of some
[2:15:05] <%BoxNavy> i swear to the lord the monsters know when you set a trap down now l ol
[2:15:12] <+yourevilredux> imagine not having a stinkmink for the capture lure
[2:15:13] <+datmegamandeeeee> I miss Dodogama
[2:15:15] <butthurtdave> YEAH TETSU! Hojo's got the baby one, I cant believe he's not in the game
[2:15:18] <+datmegamandeeeee> Best lizzy
[2:15:19] <sirtommygunn> the game is called monster HUNTER not monster TAMER
[2:15:26] <%Agami23> im learning so much watching your stream of this pat.
[2:15:28] <+ArtemisCroc> @josemoya95 to be honest I just go with whatever happens, if I want a specific result I'll just do it solo, it's not like it's really any easier online anyway
[2:15:29] <%BoxNavy> hes cute
[2:15:30] <+Beelzebubju> Killing the monster actually gives more rewards not less.
[2:15:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I have successfully used a stinkmink ONCE, and I don't know if it was worth it
[2:15:41] <DSD24> @sirtommygunn That's Monster Hunter Stories
[2:15:41] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> zzzz
[2:15:49] <Bustahhwulf> wow they throw the tranqs forward instead of at thier own feet now
[2:15:51] <+datmegamandeeeee> Take a picture
[2:15:51] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:15:52] <+Beelzebubju> Capturing is only useful for increasing chance on specific rare parts
[2:15:53] <dan_g_v> @The_Forgotten_Alligator if you want to see beforehand a lot of possible monsters for Rise, yeah sure
[2:15:58] <+red_cuppa> lmao
[2:16:01] <%BoxNavy> thats the fat
[2:16:15] <butthurtdave> ayyy wyvern gem
[2:16:15] <DSD24> I remember that throw!
[2:16:15] <dan_g_v> bseball throw
[2:16:21] <%Monkeyweed21> people who insist on capturing have a vore fetish
[2:16:21] <DSD24> It was like paintballs
[2:16:22] <%Deft_Thought> psaGiefrail psaGib psaGiefrail psaGib
[2:16:23] <%BoxNavy> yeah hunters used to throw that fuckin shit
[2:16:25] <Ris_Eltrut> Asking the monster to dinner and a movie will yield the most materials
[2:16:30] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:16:31] <EynosStyles> It doesn't matter. kill or capture get you rewards. OMG! I'm gonna cry cause I don't get one extra material
[2:16:34] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @dan_g_v  Like Valtrax from the demo, I sure hope so
[2:16:35] <Blank9> I think it was 4U that let you throw it at your feet by doing it stationary, right?
[2:16:38] <sirtommygunn> ANOTHER gem
[2:16:38] <krnksk> @Monkeyweed21 LUL
[2:16:40] <dan_g_v> no no, those are fake rewards, Pat. they don't count as real reward
[2:16:52] <josemoya95> @ArtemisCroc Yeah me too, If I really need something I would do it alone to make sure
[2:16:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Bird wyvern gems have always been kinda common iirc
[2:16:57] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I'd love to see a Turf War between Terry the Platypus and Big Zam. It'd look like 2 water balloons trying to kill each other
[2:16:58] <gallohuegos> remember paintballs
[2:16:58] <%BoxNavy> end of the day just end the hunt how you want and stop backseating
[2:16:59] <%MisterTylerrr> It's almost like it's RNG and it's totally different for everyone
[2:16:59] <butthurtdave> There's also the food skills to consider and the Dango boost is INSANE when it goes off for boosting rewards
[2:16:59] <dan_g_v> @The_Forgotten_Alligator dang right! It also has cool cutscenes, so yeah
[2:17:03] <T_Sasquatch> I know nothing :)
[2:17:04] <%Sp3ctre48> No Pat you're wrong because I said so
[2:17:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt those 5 rewards are for 2 captures
[2:17:15] <%Agami23> oh god paintballs were a thing i forgot.
[2:17:19] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt have you noticed there are two mining outcrop node types and they're separated on the map just out of spite
[2:17:24] <DusK_The_Stray> I was gonna call you bad but you stole the joke from me, fuck.
[2:17:41] <+datmegamandeeeee> People should just enjoy their silly monster game
[2:17:44] <%yendoria> So like, is this kill/carve argument about the convenience of capturing versus the usual extra parts from carving?
[2:17:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Space Marine
[2:17:52] <butthurtdave> One of the more shocking things to me was how there's no layered armor in the game at the moment unless you bought Deluxe or the Amiibos
[2:17:54] <IminyourBase> i'm the worst hunter! i use frostcraft and only use my TTS. i shoulder tackle to get to it
[2:18:01] <Mattais88> Pat's the anti-Bloodbourne Doll "Oh Bad Hunter..."
[2:18:01] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wroggi fucks
[2:18:03] <rasamune> football
[2:18:06] <commandantkobold> I'm sorry do you NOT want to be an asshole cowboy??
[2:18:09] <+ArtemisCroc> the only visual difference between normal and S sets now seems to be pigment alteration @PatStaresAt
[2:18:10] <+President_Miyazaki> Majima?
[2:18:10] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Wroggi = Eron Black
[2:18:11] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt get a fish farm going in the argosy so you can get a specific bug you need to make the skalda waist
[2:18:16] <$realm_forge> Asshole Cowboy was my stage name
[2:18:17] <%hotcarl6872> sometimes it's better to capture, sometimes it's better to kill. that is all.
[2:18:18] <+datmegamandeeeee> Only badasses roll wroggi
[2:18:18] <Blank9> I can't believe hunter s has handicraft on it at all
[2:18:21] <Equirah> @PatStaresAt you'll want that Skalda waist piece
[2:18:25] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:18:25] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:18:25] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:18:27] <d_man303> get leather for geologist 3
[2:18:29] <ScreamLord> And it looks dope
[2:18:31] <DestroPrime83> So mad I cant use Tetranadon because i play GL
[2:18:34] <%logoth_> belt pelt lpltuasus
[2:18:36] <%BoxNavy> bellpepper
[2:18:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the 5 capture rewards you got are from 2 captures, you lost 1 carve you could get from killing
[2:18:37] <dan_g_v> that one!
[2:18:38] <DSD24> I like the Kula Ya Ku set for Hunting Horn
[2:18:39] <ScreamLord> Skin
[2:18:42] <Theoyveyman> Pigment alteration is so dissapointing in this game
[2:18:46] <%JumboCrunchies> And you can -dye- it now!
[2:18:46] <Zeif00> I was a while before I started replacing my HR Izuchi, it pretty good
[2:18:51] <illtima> I can't wait for gif to toss a toy at your head
[2:19:00] <commandantkobold> Wroggi asshole cowboy gang rise up
[2:19:07] <butthurtdave> I remember having the Carve/Capture debate all the way back in Tri; it never dies
[2:19:08] <dan_g_v> that's a mouth!
[2:19:12] <Skyjet24_> the changes to the weapon and armor selection screens has me so fucking happy
[2:19:12] <+Natethegreat716> tigrex
[2:19:12] <Blank9> I like tigrex gs
[2:19:15] <Ipsenscastle> tigrex for gs yeah
[2:19:16] <dan_g_v> I love these weapons!
[2:19:18] <%BoxNavy> that sliver of blue is decent for gs
[2:19:20] <JonnyJug> That Tigrex GS is dope
[2:19:20] <%JumboCrunchies> @Theoyveyman When you finish the current story, you can dye a second color, which gives you way more control.
[2:19:22] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> most monsters in rise take extra damage from Ice
[2:19:27] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wroggi cat suit is best cat suit
[2:19:29] <butthurtdave> Diablos weapons tho
[2:19:31] <Blank9> because narga has a lot of good other weapons, but tigrex is less good on others
[2:19:36] <+Celarious> Make the Rampage weapon
[2:19:36] <DublinRage> @commandantkobold Yee(and I cannot stress this enough) Haw
[2:19:37] <+datmegamandeeeee> If you disagree your wrong
[2:19:39] <DusK_The_Stray> The problem with the Carve/Capture debate is that it changes every few games and people like to argue with outdated information.
[2:19:44] <commandantkobold> @datmegamandeeeee That is also a fact
[2:19:46] <@PeachSaliva> Booooo who is this bad gamer boooooooo

[2:21:27] <sirtommygunn> She'll get the better drops
[2:21:31] <%ssjklyco> She'll reach high rank in 3 hours.
[2:21:37] <KasiCrafter> PvP mode is just longsword play.
[2:21:39] <@PeachSaliva> I’ll do so good I’ll still kick yojr ass
[2:21:39] <sirtommygunn> make you look bad on the dps meters
[2:21:41] <MoonKing> she means she'll play LS and trip you every 2 seconds
[2:21:41] <skyentombment> mere seconds later "PAAAAATHUUUUU MONSTER HURT MY FEEFEE"
[2:21:43] <%SirGO0SE> there can only be one alpha gamer in the house hold and it is elmo
[2:21:44] <Ipsenscastle> I'll kick your ass at cooperation

[2:21:51] <butthurtdave> CLOWN SUIT TIME
[2:21:53] <%JoshManVGH> She can bonk and interrupt Pat's combos.
[2:22:09] <+Celarious> Pat the rampage weapon is literally just the tigrex weapon without negative affinity
[2:22:11] <%Alazull> @PeachSaliva Talking all this good shit but I foresee a stream that goes a lot like your fight against the Cursed Greattree
[2:22:14] <%BoxNavy> pat how did you get so much fucking zenny
[2:22:24] <%gitgouda> i hear the bow is great at messing up peoples combos.
[2:22:29] <skyentombment> Or , alternatively "TITS IN MY ASS OH LORD, BAD MAN, AW HELL!"
[2:22:40] <@Mechz71> cool sword pat
[2:22:46] <butthurtdave> Rondine sells ore occasionally that goes for 10K and the Cohoot nest in the buddy area regularly has Eggs to sell

[2:23:35] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:23:38] <+Gespens> Of course the Nargacuga LS would be the best
[2:23:39] <+Natethegreat716> and get quick sheath 3 as soon as yo can
[2:23:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes Quick Sheathe is now meta for LS
[2:24:02] <Blank9> narga's best to third best for like, every weapon right now
[2:24:03] <butthurtdave> I already built all my Lances and my dream set until the update so I've been needing a new weapon to second and was thinking either SnS or LS
[2:24:08] <Blank9> I hope they add lucent narga someday
[2:24:09] <KasiCrafter> The extra edge gives it more sharpness
[2:24:11] <+Noir_Valdr> that miss turned into a hit
[2:24:14] <+Noir_Valdr> gg
[2:24:17] <@Mechz71> Use the LS the game gives you 4Head
[2:24:18] <powerprotoman> pat get the bird!
[2:24:19] <Oxybe> Narga stuff is great. most weaps i've seen have white dura and high crit. real nice

[2:24:58] <%hotcarl6872> Narga melee weapons are pretty great so far
[2:24:58] <%AncelDeLambert> grab that blue bird, get them drops
[2:24:59] <JonnyJug> Bird gives extra rewards

[2:25:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Boosts Quest Rewards

[2:25:07] <+Neku054> Some give more rewards, some give more money
[2:25:07] <mybigmeech> gives you more rewards
[2:25:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt the blue bird increases luck on drops, I believe
[2:25:08] <moosemonkey397> the fortune owl increases oyur quest rewards
[2:25:08] <$JojoPiero> Bonus Rewards if it's Blue, Double Zenny if Orange
[2:25:10] <KasiCrafter> Never found Lucky Life before, Pat?
[2:25:16] <+Noir_Valdr> two rare life, one gives extra rewards, one gives extra zenny
[2:25:19] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Bird is on mini map
[2:25:24] <+OneTrueAsshat> you dont need the owl just carve

[2:25:31] <%Alazull> Randomly shows up
[2:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> walk up to it and grab it
[2:25:32] <Manwad> They appear in set locations
[2:25:32] <+datmegamandeeeee> If a small animal shows up on your mini map just grab it. Always
[2:25:34] <dan_g_v> go find it, go go go
[2:25:35] <Mattais88> Random encounters
[2:25:37] <mybigmeech> Gotta be lucky SeemsGood

[2:25:46] <PanicSwytch> Follow the bird until it perches up somewhere

[2:25:50] <sirtommygunn> It lands
[2:25:50] <+Das_Prints> They spawn randomly on the map and you catch it.
[2:25:54] <JonnyJug> Zangrief

[2:26:18] <dmastermonk> @PatStaresAt Isn't Gief looking depressed the entire reason you guys bought him?
[2:26:19] <Blank9> zangief misses his mama, like blanka
[2:26:36] <BiologicGases> birb stops sometimes
[2:26:38] <JonnyJug> Must be missing his old glasses

[2:27:01] <SulfurousAcid> remember how you could play as palicos in Generations? good times
[2:27:05] <%ssjklyco> You gotta put the shirt on him
[2:27:17] <Blank9> he looks like Mike Cosgrove from Freakazoid
[2:27:22] <butthurtdave> Any hopes for what the endgame for Rise will be?
[2:27:30] <%Deft_Thought> Do y'all think the game is gonna touched up for the PC port?
[2:27:34] <%AncelDeLambert> oh that's AWESOME
[2:27:36] <+Celarious> fucking cat
[2:27:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I didn't notice that
[2:27:39] <BlueSpartan119> yeah new sharpness gauge is super good
[2:28:01] <sirtommygunn> sound design in Rise is great
[2:28:05] <Chimeraelite> Did Pat just get into High Rank?
[2:28:06] <Blank9> I'd hope the added endgame is gonna be elder dragons and apexes outside of rampages
[2:28:06] <%AncelDeLambert> it SUPER is
[2:28:08] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck that one
[2:28:13] <%BoxNavy> a cute fang
[2:28:16] <sirtommygunn> like the wirebug recharge sound too
[2:28:18] <+Noir_Valdr> ah yes, the cute fangs
[2:28:24] <powerprotoman> when you down a level in sharpness the color shatters revealing the lower level of sharpness
[2:28:24] <JonnyJug> Drop parts having the beam of light is really nice as well
[2:28:25] <dan_g_v> @Chimeraelite he did
[2:28:28] <+Noir_Valdr> there's an entire subreddit dedicated for that
[2:28:30] <Bustahhwulf> whens big tiddy goth fang
[2:28:31] <$QueequegTheater> "gameplay"
[2:28:35] <+Neku054> it isnt tho, theres ore if you wirebug at the end of the jump
[2:28:36] <Parapattern> "Cosgrove, how come you never got married?" Because I like meat too much.   You can get married and still eat a lot of meat.  Cosgrove: ...I didn't know that.
[2:28:39] <dan_g_v> we are running out of time!
[2:28:39] <+Neku054> and a lore point
[2:28:42] <Chimeraelite> Awesome, he's about where I am then
[2:28:53] <BlueSpartan119> yeah that one's so fucken pointless
[2:28:57] <jumpyhugs> it takes you to a couple ores though
[2:28:58] <powerprotoman> is it the one you use to wirebug to a secret area
[2:29:10] <Chimeraelite> You can be insane like me and actually get up there with ONLY 2 but fuck is it annoying
[2:29:10] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about outriders rn
[2:29:29] <BlueSpartan119> there's a spot you can wallrun up if you only have 2 bugs
[2:29:33] <+Neku054> wire bug at the end of the jump pat
[2:29:38] <+Neku054> ore and lore
[2:29:40] <powerprotoman> you know you can climb up that wall over their
[2:29:42] <Mattais88> is that what that area is for?
[2:29:42] <BlueSpartan119> it's like a black rock in the ice
[2:29:45] <ne0bunny> theres another way up there without 3 wirebugs, theres a wall you can run up on other mountian
[2:29:59] <powerprotoman> pat msised the secret area
[2:30:00] <%BoxNavy> great
[2:30:04] <gawdCLOUD> WTF!?
[2:30:08] <pivikks> theres mining nodes up there
[2:30:08] <EynosStyles> There are 3 mining nodes
[2:30:09] <+Noir_Valdr> ...could there be a rare endemic life up there?
[2:30:10] <butthurtdave> It takes more time climbing the mountain than it does going to that spot
[2:30:11] <Zeif00> y'all missed the ore LUL
[2:30:11] <jumpyhugs> You can wirebug to those wooden arches, there's stuff there

[2:31:34] <powerprotoman> bet apt doesnt even know he can climb the wall instead of using three wirebugs to get up there
[2:31:38] <sirtommygunn> using consumable items woah
[2:31:44] <Blank9> Extending with air dodges or wall jumps helps
[2:31:44] <EynosStyles> on this episode of Pat is wrong....
[2:31:46] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> you can with 2 but you need doggie
[2:31:47] <powerprotoman> you only need 2
[2:31:54] <$JojoPiero> Don't forget you can "Air Dodge" for extra range per Wirebug use
[2:31:59] <ne0bunny> from back of other mountain

[2:41:00] <butthurtdave> Zam's definitely the most goofy fun
[2:41:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He's gonna be back
[2:41:04] <$QueequegTheater> I don't even have EX roulette unlocked, any content that needs LFG to do well is just poison to me
[2:41:06] <%PinkertonDanPie> odoggo
[2:41:06] <Blank9> I miss rotten vale combat theme
[2:41:15] <Chimeraelite> The new Ice Blade monster. Goss Harag is fucking awesome looking
[2:41:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Odagoron had the best fucking weapons, they looked so cool
[2:41:18] <%weissguard> He's gotta get dolled up
[2:41:29] <+sumrand0> Tobi-Kadachi is pretty close to Odo in terms of size shape and general moveset
[2:41:30] <%PinkertonDanPie> I MISS THE WIGGLER HAT
[2:41:37] <butthurtdave> Goss is so cool, that slow walk he does towards you after he clobbers you is so menacing
[2:41:38] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Surprised he wasn't in. His dual blades rocked
[2:41:43] <%YakumoYomi> Pat...
[2:41:44] <%BoxNavy> they have to load in
[2:41:47] <%twoto858> What just happened?
[2:41:47] <%AncelDeLambert> the LBG was the best LBG of vanilla World
[2:41:48] <+Noir_Valdr> Didn't put Odogaron in the game but they put Jyuratodus in
[2:41:54] <sir_foxwood> Devijo was my favorite
[2:41:55] <+sumrand0> WIGGLER HAT WAS LIFE
[2:41:56] <+Noir_Valdr> because everyone wanted the dumb mud fish
[2:42:00] <butthurtdave> I still cant get over how buttery fast the load times in this are compared to World
[2:42:00] <nivlac_555> lmao
[2:42:00] <$QueequegTheater> Pat have you considered being taller
[2:42:01] <JonnyJug> It has the dango icon if you have eaten
[2:42:05] <$QueequegTheater> For better internet
[2:42:11] <Mattais88> Noting but phials
[2:42:20] <MoonKing> Jyuratodus being an HR only monster this time blows me the fuck away
[2:42:24] <%BoxNavy> get fucked
[2:42:31] <sirtommygunn> I have faith that they'll get the all the good monsters from World in over time
[2:42:35] <2DSuperiority> 999 boiled eggs
[2:42:38] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:42:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> the intrepid hunters hunting a penis monster for his teeth
[2:42:42] <butthurtdave> Wasnt Jyura the urgent?
[2:42:46] <$QueequegTheater> The last time I tried to make friends I accidentally ended up in a gay furry ERP free company
[2:42:49] <%YakumoYomi> @MoonKing Right?
[2:42:51] <$Afterman_> virgin khezu vs chad gigginox
[2:42:55] <josemoya95> Pat I know the music is great, but what did you mean in the podcast when you said Rise has "more" music
[2:43:02] <%BoxNavy> KILL THAT BIRD
[2:43:03] <%PinkertonDanPie> foreskin monster
[2:43:20] <Theoyveyman> JYURA GOT BEEFED THO
[2:43:25] <sirtommygunn> If a cool world monster didn't get in immediately I'm sure it's because they're giving it sick new moves
[2:43:34] <%BoxNavy> da bun bun
[2:43:36] <+Celarious> mount the big chungus and ram it into the penis monster
[2:43:47] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Stop the pigeon, stop the pigeon
[2:43:49] <Theoyveyman> Anjanath got in @sirtommygunn
[2:43:49] <+sumrand0> Nothing quite like the experience of rolling into a lobby in Iceborne as a party of 3-4 hunters HR/MR 999 all wearing Wiggler Helmets and helping carry people through their first Alatreon clears
[2:44:04] <butthurtdave> We got Khezu, but where's Gigginox?
[2:44:06] <AllenDeadman> beat the pp monster
[2:44:11] <%AncelDeLambert> SingsNote all I want to do is bon bon bon bon and SKRSKS and take your money SingsNote
[2:44:14] <%PinkertonDanPie> I did that!
[2:44:30] <%solracc25> Bird UP
[2:44:31] <Theoyveyman> Beat up the cock with your cock Pat
[2:44:37] <%PinkertonDanPie> man I miss that wiggler hat
[2:44:37] <+sumrand0> Alatreon LBG + Wide Range 5 Free Meal 3 and safi armor was the ultra carry
[2:44:46] <%KineticZen> Khezu gangbang
[2:44:52] <%BoxNavy> bullued
[2:44:52] <butthurtdave> Just wait until Jho and Bagel get added to the game
[2:44:52] <+sumrand0> omg
[2:44:52] <Psyramics> Is this a Monster Truck Show but without any trucks?
[2:44:53] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I hate the look of khezu
[2:44:54] <sirtommygunn> TAG TEAM MONSTER MATCH
[2:44:55] <+vaderxyz1970> is that a dire rabbit!?
[2:44:58] <AllenDeadman> BULLY THE KHEZU
[2:44:59] <MoonKing> CBT
[2:45:02] <+Celarious> Damn Monster Hunter Stories 2 looking crazy
[2:45:13] <%KineticZen> a lagomorph zombie KAppa
[2:45:17] <Ravioli_Ronin> Dating app pfp, but with monster hunter monsters
[2:45:20] <%YakumoYomi> Rabbit/Koala
[2:45:25] <$Afterman_> a sus fang is a fang that came out of khezu's penis
[2:45:25] <Mattais88> Khezu deserves to be bullied
[2:45:27] <+Zenryoku21> i hate whatever this is
[2:45:28] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK YOU KHEZU
[2:45:33] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Fun fact Khezu are normally red colored
[2:45:35] <%PinkertonDanPie> I use the rathian/bishaten set for wide range now
[2:45:35] <+sumrand0> Beat that cock!
[2:45:36] <sirtommygunn> eternal hatred for Khezu
[2:45:44] <$Afterman_> because they couldnt include chad gigginox vs the virgin khezu
[2:45:44] <Blank9> gigginox is just a better khezu
[2:45:45] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a Khezu, it's a bitch
[2:45:52] <%BubbaRands> gigginox is a cooler Khezu
[2:45:53] <%KineticZen> Giggi was cool
[2:45:55] <Visorak6> Gigginox is completely improved
[2:45:56] <$Afterman_> if they include gigginox theyd have to abandon the shitty khezu forever
[2:45:59] <+Tucker0603> gigganox is cooler than this garbage
[2:46:03] <%weissguard> Exclusive to Gen 3 of Monster Hunter, not just 3U.
[2:46:05] <%Agami23> gigginox has eyes
[2:46:07] <%AncelDeLambert> what's wrong, are you all not enjoying the uncircumsized dick monster?
[2:46:08] <tolloponik> japan liked Kezu more
[2:46:08] <dan_g_v> Imagine have only 2 head and mouth
[2:46:08] <Theoyveyman> Because Japan likes Khezu
[2:46:08] <BlueSpartan119> japan loves the creepy penis, they think it's cute apparently
[2:46:09] <Blank9> he's laying eggs and spitting poison and poison based
[2:46:10] <+sumrand0> Best Monster Theme of all time though
[2:46:13] <%MisterRockett> Well that's why. It doesn't look like as much of a dick freak.
[2:46:14] <%KineticZen> Fighting a khezu out in the open where it can't hang off ceilings and drop larvae just isn't the same
[2:46:14] <dan_g_v> I mean, only 1 head
[2:46:14] <%YakumoYomi> Baleful Gigginox can stay away, tho
[2:46:14] <TehMud> Look they have a dick quota to fill.
[2:46:19] <Blank9> and hanging out in dark caves
[2:46:22] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Oh, that's just one of those assholes from End of Evangelion
[2:46:23] <$Afterman_> i never got a chance to play 3u, only tri. Was 3u much better than tri?
[2:46:24] <koffeemancer> So its a double ended dildo?
[2:46:24] <MoonKing> gigginox doesn't look like a dick, but it has an ovipositor to make up for it
[2:46:31] <%KineticZen> or is that gigginox now I'm getting them mixed up
[2:46:35] <AllenDeadman> you just tripped lol
[2:46:38] <%JumboCrunchies> Speaking of not being able to go near him, do y'all have any idea what iLvL the new Nier raid is dropping?
[2:46:45] <%KineticZen> Yeah that was gig
[2:46:46] <anglebreakfast> Gigginox is confined to flat fuck friday
[2:46:47] <rasamune> Instead of being a dick freak it's a weird vagina tube that lays egg mounds
[2:46:52] <+sumrand0> Did you know his theme in Rise is a remix of his OG theme
[2:46:53] <butthurtdave> I want Giggi back so bad, its Poison weapons were the coolest looking shit
[2:46:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oh god the veins >_>
[2:46:57] <Blank9> 3U was tri with a lot more
[2:47:02] <%UltraViolet371> I hope this penis dies
[2:47:04] <+sumrand0> lol
[2:47:06] <%shurtal> dragoon?
[2:47:06] <Parapattern> Look like a mass-produced EVA
[2:47:11] <Blank9> more weapons, more monsters, the endgame ones were amazing
[2:47:16] <%Deft_Thought> Haaaaaaaaaaaaate this monster
[2:47:16] <$Afterman_> @Blank9 more in what way? I started my monhun journey with tri
[2:47:18] <AllenDeadman> 3U was Tri but there wasn't a horrible lack of content
[2:47:20] <$Afterman_> ahhh nice
[2:47:21] <Blank9> lucent nargacuga needs to come back
[2:47:27] <Sunstalker> Is the soundtrack turned off or just not playing?
[2:47:30] <$Afterman_> i remember farming the fuck out of alatreon at the end, loved his lance
[2:47:31] <butthurtdave> Yee he's pretty bouncy and only has a few sweet spots
[2:47:40] <AllenDeadman> this is the khezu sountrack
[2:47:43] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:47:47] <anglebreakfast> 3 had cut out half the weapons from the previous game
[2:47:48] <%BubbaRands> no dont explain it
[2:47:50] <+Gespens> 3U had the missing weapons that Tri didn't, for starters
[2:47:50] <+sumrand0> Someone's new here haha
[2:47:54] <%SirGO0SE> :)
[2:47:55] <TehMud> Yup.
[2:47:55] <anglebreakfast> 3U added them back
[2:47:56] <Srthunda> some people cannot appreciate art
[2:48:01] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @Sunstalker it's playing, can't you hear it
[2:48:01] <sirtommygunn> khezu bad soundtrack?
[2:48:01] <dan_g_v> I love the orchestral version of this theme
[2:48:04] <%Alazull> Can you break Khezu's tail?
[2:48:05] <+sumrand0> This track slaps
[2:48:05] <$Afterman_> ye i knew tri didnt have all the weapons (but i didnt know that at the time)
[2:48:09] <TioXyco> @Sunstalker what you talking about? khezu's theme is playing
[2:48:09] <TehMud> They had to go the extra mile with Khezu
[2:48:10] <iosephe> Khezu's theme is 4'33
[2:48:16] <$Dakuu75> *walks in* OH-jesus-christ. it's the SIlent Hill 3 monster
[2:48:26] <eyedntcry> best theme in the game LUL
[2:48:34] <anglebreakfast> MH 3 essentially had the shortest monster list besides MH 1
[2:48:35] <%shurtal> pee poops?
[2:48:40] <T_Sasquatch> All i see is eva tbh
[2:48:40] <%BubbaRands> I love this part
[2:48:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> THIS is the Khezu? Oh I hate it.
[2:48:44] <Bustahhwulf> quick pat do the world trumpet but acapella
[2:48:45] <TioXyco> @eyedntcry hands down
[2:48:46] <DSD24> Yay its Khezu
[2:48:47] <DianaTheAscian> they made khezus skin more bumpy i hate it
[2:48:51] <%KineticZen> Hell yeah
[2:48:53] <Theoyveyman> IT'S NYX
[2:48:54] <butthurtdave> I was also hoping for more bug monsters in the game at launch
[2:48:58] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[2:48:58] <%BoxNavy> ive always appreciated khezu for how creepy and gross it is
[2:48:59] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Hey, Pat, remember that time in EVA when, like, half a dozen of these things just totally wrecked Asuka's shit?
[2:49:00] <Mattais88> 905!
[2:49:01] <DSD24> Khezu is really cute in Monster Hunter Stories
[2:49:02] <$TzarSalad> that is one ugly monster
[2:49:02] <powerprotoman> hey pat check your twitter i showed you how to get the other relic up that mountain near the "useless" great wire bug
[2:49:08] <butthurtdave> God, if we can get Nerscylla and the Seltas duo back, I would be so jazzed
[2:49:12] <BlueSpartan119> @Sunstalker the music plays after the monster spots you, Dick-Chicken is blind, so no music
[2:49:13] <+Celarious> Waiting for the edit where Zangief's face is replaced with the Brendan Fraser meme
[2:49:15] <rasamune> Just hold on, Khezu's theme is a banger, it'll start playing as soon as Khezu sees them
[2:49:29] <%PinkertonDanPie> can we get the Val Hazak back?
[2:49:38] <Chimeraelite> the lips are wonderful
[2:49:43] <AllenDeadman> I wish we could
[2:49:52] <+Celarious> no I hate vape dragon
[2:49:55] <Srthunda> he can ride that dick tho
[2:49:56] <%StaceMcGate> fighting the ole penis monster eh
[2:49:59] <Theoyveyman> @bluespartan119 Blackveil Val Hazak is also blind, but his theme plays
[2:50:00] <ScreamLord> It'd be hilarious if they actually did make a Khezu theme but you never hear it because he's blind
[2:50:06] <T_Sasquatch> All you need is a bitchy redhead and you've got an eva crossover ... Oh wait Kappa
[2:50:06] <butthurtdave> Bring back Val but take away that blight of his that you had to gem in to fight him
[2:50:12] <%PinkertonDanPie> fart huffer dragon is bae
[2:50:35] <%Deft_Thought> Kill it faster
[2:50:36] <+Tucker0603> if two khezus fight, would that be docking?
[2:50:38] <JonnyJug> It's on a 10 minute timer to ride again
[2:50:47] <+sumrand0> Everytime I fight Khezu in Rise I've been playing Mabuchi's Theme from Yakuza 7, no reason other than that song is banging and makes the experience less irritating
[2:50:53] <butthurtdave> Oh it's time-based?
[2:51:03] <sirtommygunn> two khezu making out
[2:51:03] <%PinkertonDanPie> screm
[2:51:15] <BlueSpartan119> @Theoyveyman he sees w/ effluvia, also you can break the shit off his face
[2:51:15] <Blank9> time and then damage needed to mount increases
[2:51:18] <%BoxNavy> i dont get the khezu hate personally
[2:51:19] <butthurtdave> I'd believe it
[2:51:28] <Blank9> launching a monster into another monster automatically makes them ride-able too
[2:51:35] <%PinkertonDanPie> ikr I just think it's funny
[2:51:36] <sirtommygunn> it looks gross and has an annoying moveset
[2:51:41] <butthurtdave> he a good fun monster but gigi is better
[2:52:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Pat be gaslighting
[2:52:17] <%KineticZen> This complete lack of music is terrible
[2:52:21] <AllenDeadman> what do you mean? it's the best theme in the game
[2:52:27] <BlueSpartan119> Wyvern Rides have a 10 min cooldown
[2:52:29] <Visorak6> Didnt they always?
[2:52:35] <+sumrand0> Fighting monsters is fun and challenging but fighting monsters AND your teammates can be a blast hahaha
[2:52:39] <$Afterman_> sure grnadpa
[2:52:42] <AllenDeadman> @Visorak6 nooo
[2:52:43] <$Afterman_> lets get you back to bed
[2:52:45] <butthurtdave> and sometimes you'd be underwater
[2:52:48] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, and it SUCKED
[2:52:48] <Visorak6> I thought only G rank did that Pat
[2:52:50] <+skylerpilot> same in 4
[2:52:52] <$Afterman_> they did that in tri
[2:52:54] <%AncelDeLambert> IT FUCKING SUCKED
[2:52:55] <mybigmeech> Happens in gu too
[2:52:57] <MoonKing> I totally forgot maps used to be seperate items holy fuck
[2:53:00] <rasamune> Oh, fuck, yeah, remember when Map was a fucking ITEM
[2:53:01] <Blank9> and items wouldn't show up besides map until 15 minutes
[2:53:03] <$Dakuu75> @Afterman_  XD
[2:53:05] <+Pendragwn> yes
[2:53:05] <+BettyMwwaahh> wow old mon hun were awful
[2:53:09] <AllenDeadman> it used to happen at High Rank
[2:53:12] <$Afterman_> god im glad maps arent an item anymore
[2:53:15] <%blistexthief> "Back in my day"
[2:53:16] <+skylerpilot> to this day I never check the supply box because why would there be stuff in the supply box
[2:53:19] <JonnyJug> Haha
[2:53:21] <Visorak6> Look man I started in 3P
[2:53:23] <$Afterman_> old man pat
[2:53:23] <+sumrand0> Mining Ore used to use a CONSUMABLE pickax!
[2:53:29] <$Afterman_> which monhun did pat start with? 3u?
[2:53:33] <%Deft_Thought> Pat is unlocking his true self
[2:53:37] <butthurtdave> World really changed the series for the better, I'll never understand old heads that think it ruined the series
[2:53:39] <%weissguard> Pat loves it pass it on
[2:53:45] <$Afterman_> nice. we're third gen buddies
[2:53:49] <tolloponik> I remember the hunt that did that to me also introduced me to the cuco Deviljho hunt
[2:53:51] <jbrachob> stop using peanutbutter as footlotion pat
[2:53:52] <BlueSpartan119> LUL
[2:54:01] <AllenDeadman> I started with MH Tri
[2:54:05] <Chimeraelite> I started a little with Generations but good god my hands hurt
[2:54:06] <+emVulpine> A friend of mine started with the original game on PS2, MHW felt very validating to him.
[2:54:07] <+sumrand0> 5G makes the frogs gay
[2:54:12] <AllenDeadman> ... in retrospective, I'm glad, they only got better
[2:54:14] <%templar010> Got my first dose today
[2:54:16] <%templar010> Feels good man
[2:54:20] <powerprotoman> when you get a chance check ya twitter i captured a video to show you how you get the other relic up the mountain in 9
[2:54:23] <TheFramedWarlock> 3U was ten years ago, old man
[2:54:25] <%BubbaRands> 5G in my veins? Sign me up!
[2:54:26] <+ryujinran> but then everybody would try to get way too close to you to get good reception
[2:54:27] <Blank9> I started with tri too, as a baby paralysis sns
[2:54:31] <+Tucker0603> dude I looked at monster hunter tonfas, IM PISSED I NEVER GOT TO USE EM! PILE BUNKER TONFAS!!!!
[2:54:35] <Theoyveyman> @butthurtdave But World also had a BAJILLION problems of its own
[2:54:37] <$Dakuu75> It's like when Nail is in Piccalo's head, jsut playing mine sweeper
[2:54:40] <$Afterman_> @templar010 they might have told you this, but you wont have full protection for 14 days after ur 2ND SHOT. so pls keep being safe
[2:54:40] <dmtjinni> quiet stream today
[2:54:42] <sirtommygunn> oh man this khezu aint dead yet
[2:54:42] <%ssjklyco> I got my first 5G vaccine yesterday
[2:54:45] <Blank9> 3U I learned HH and GS
[2:54:47] <butthurtdave> You can throw unlimited kunai btw
[2:55:03] <%Deft_Thought> Once you get that good good vaccine, you'll realize Bill Gates' true vision and become a 5G tower to unite the world
[2:55:06] <%lemon_rinds> lemon_rinds subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 12 month streak! A while ago on stream, you mentioned that the disease anime moms die from is based on a real illness that plagued Japan. I can’t remember what stream it was, but I was hoping you could drop that fact again ❤️ thanks, cool streamer man!
[2:55:11] <sirtommygunn> blaming the dog for his low skill
[2:55:19] <MoonKing> Gunlance is super good at knocking khezu off the ceiling now
[2:55:28] <+sumrand0> @dakuu75 every MH game has problems/annoyances
[2:55:30] <$Afterman_> is gunlance good in rise?
[2:55:30] <%BoxNavy> ig is fantastic
[2:55:33] <Blank9> IG is too
[2:55:34] <$Afterman_> i used them in world after i got tired of DBs
[2:55:42] <Theoyveyman> Beat the whole game with kunai
[2:55:46] <butthurtdave> There are no bad weapons
[2:55:46] <+skylerpilot> Assist bug is great, its Valor style from Gen U
[2:55:59] <mybigmeech> @afterman_ You can chain blast dashes now so... maybe?
[2:56:03] <Frostydough1> Hello friends just got out of work how far are we? 2 or 3 star hub missions?
[2:56:09] <+Tucker0603> bring tonfas back, I wanna use pile bunker tonfas!!!!
[2:56:10] <%Deft_Thought> I've seen no one using SnS. Excited to run it when Rise hits PC
[2:56:10] <sirtommygunn> i wish the moves you could do were constantly displayed like they were in world
[2:56:12] <dmtjinni> LUL
[2:56:13] <$Afterman_> @mybigmeech that does sound fun.
[2:56:15] <AllenDeadman> he really said no and left
[2:56:16] <Blank9> the bug's pretty slow, but there's bugs now that grab 2 essence at once
[2:56:20] <%BubbaRands> wiffed
[2:56:21] <butthurtdave> WHIFF
[2:56:23] <%BubbaRands> LUL
[2:56:25] <$Afterman_> @Frostydough1 just got into HR hub a bit ago
[2:56:35] <tattleworm> ig's the best it's ever been, it just sucks that diving wyvern is locked behind hr6
[2:56:37] <%WhereIsWill> the gigabotch
[2:56:47] <+skylerpilot> @Tucker0603 same, I want them too
[2:56:48] <+allups> I started with whatever monster hunter came with PS plus way back when as a PSP offer and then i jumped to whatever the recent 3DS one came out
[2:56:55] <+sumrand0> But compared to other games MH "problems" are tolerable its not like Talismans are bought via microtransactions
[2:57:00] <butthurtdave> OH THE COMBO
[2:57:01] <$Afterman_> Yo justinian, am I crazy in thinking DBs feel godly in rise when compared to World? because it feels night and day difference in how good they are
[2:57:02] <Theoyveyman> WAAAOUAOUAOUAOUAOUUUU
[2:57:10] <Srthunda> an ass of steal
[2:57:11] <AllenDeadman> his asshole is tight
[2:57:11] <butthurtdave> his ass has teeth
[2:57:12] <sirtommygunn> hit with the tip
[2:57:17] <%weissguard> Justinian will part the Red Sea with his Beyblade
[2:57:32] <+skylerpilot> @tattleworm I also wish Dive replaced the other silkbind instead of the retreat, seems really weird that it replaces your defensive silkbind and not your offensive one
[2:57:33] <$Afterman_> justinian's beyblade stand is just Levi
[2:57:36] <Zeif00> Seeing Khezu just reminds me of that Bloodborne dude who ragequit to LR Khezu now
[2:57:36] <Frostydough1> Oh sick same, that khezu lightening ball damage is REALLY surprising, also didn’t help that I still haven’t switch from like 20 something armor LUL
[2:57:36] <tolloponik> it's nice to see other people have a weirdly rough time with this guy
[2:57:59] <Blank9> IG once you unlock all skills is tons of fun for flying or big monsters
[2:58:19] <butthurtdave> No blue box on his icon
[2:58:21] <DianaTheAscian> did Pat get the scroll in the buddy plaza?
[2:58:22] <godzookylives> twist that dick!
[2:58:29] <+sumrand0> Aerial SAED made Khezu much easier to deal with once you're used to his patterns it's a quick fight
[2:58:34] <+allups> TWIST IT
[2:58:36] <%Agami23> yeah, dualblades can counter into it
[2:58:40] <+sumrand0> gotten used
[2:58:47] <+abrupt_abe> That's a lot of hitboxes, you can really abuse counters
[2:58:52] <Chimeraelite> I think I found that out from Parrying it on a LS and going back in
[2:59:13] <Blank9> GL is good for him just because his wings and tail are so hard
[2:59:17] <Blank9> but you don't have to care about that
[2:59:18] <butthurtdave> The new lance Shield Charge is also fukkin overpowered as shit because you're completley invincible during it and can plow right through a Diablos and Tigrex charge
[2:59:22] <sirtommygunn> this is why Earplugs is mandatory for me
[2:59:24] <AllenDeadman> glad to see some things don't change
[2:59:24] <%thebeargoesHONK> i don't like this angry dick chicken
[2:59:25] <%BoxNavy> i wonder why
[2:59:25] <ScreamLord> Khezu's one of the screamiest monsters in the series
[2:59:35] <stormhawk9891> Yeah Khezu just never shuts up
[2:59:43] <$Afterman_> @butthurtdave what kind of charge? I was a lance main in tri so I might give it a try after I tire of DBs
[2:59:44] <Saltmeisterr> wow u guys been really beating this meat
[2:59:46] <AllenDeadman> raw dick chicken obtained
[2:59:49] <%Deft_Thought> Gross
[2:59:52] <Blank9> he has no eyes and he must scream
[2:59:59] <jcflyguy> I love Pat's callouts.
[2:59:59] <+allups> THUMBS UP
[2:59:59] <%BubbaRands> Veiny
[3:00:03] <Visorak6> Oh I think I know why I was confused Pat, supplies used to arrive like 10 minutes into the hunt Pat IIRC
[3:00:09] <ScreamLord> I hate that he has actual lips now. Dick lips
[3:00:10] <MoonKing> The worst part about HD Khezu is his silent hill ass toenails
[3:00:10] <+McDerpus> I miss when one of khezu's tells for being capturable was him just going braindead for 5 seconds
[3:00:22] <AllenDeadman> @Blank9 HE WILL scream
[3:00:38] <butthurtdave> @Afterman_  it's  a Switch skill for the Dash Charge, so instead of doing the multi hits with the lance, you do a big shield rush like the one Art from GU.  It does KO damage
[3:00:39] <%Deft_Thought> W O W
[3:00:39] <+sumrand0> @patstaresat Who's more blind: Khezu or Paige without her glasses
[3:00:42] <powerprotoman> yo pat check your twitter real quick i sent you a thing
[3:00:43] <+allups> wow
[3:00:43] <sirtommygunn> many thunder sack
[3:00:47] <cherrycottontail> NO PAT you can only get 2!
[3:00:49] <+HodouVAN> you can carve 4 times now and can get double items from carves...
[3:00:51] <cherrycottontail> Reddit told me so!
[3:00:52] <%MisterTylerrr> No waaayyyyyyy
[3:00:52] <$JojoPiero> Certain Mats ONLY exist as Carve rewards
[3:00:54] <+McDerpus> that's two slots technically, the drop chances of those slots has a chance to be 2 items
[3:01:00] <$Afterman_> @butthurtdave nice. that sounds cool af
[3:01:01] <+sumrand0> luve ya @peachsaliva lol
[3:01:02] <reddpop_> ONE GUY AT RISK
[3:01:05] <+HodouVAN> so... you can get 6+ items from carves...
[3:01:09] <%superc37> no youre not pat
[3:01:13] <%MisterTylerrr> @JojoPiero You're WRONG!!!
[3:01:21] <ScreamLord> Some monsters I kill out of spite.
[3:01:22] <butthurtdave> Yee, I use it all the time now; definitely beats the the Silkbinds which suuuuuuuuuck
[3:01:25] <+hrudzie_1> is this game worth it for single player only?
[3:01:27] <JackaxeAM> lol cut off
[3:01:30] <+McDerpus> @jojopiero incorrect, they will also exist as either a break or target reward
[3:01:31] <%BoxNavy> he cut your ass off
[3:01:31] <%StaceMcGate> Pat LUL
[3:01:32] <Srthunda> straight up cut off the url
[3:01:33] <DusK_The_Stray> Pat doesn't understand math, you should know that since the whole 50% thing
[3:01:34] <%Agami23> left before justinian could even say it
[3:01:35] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Crazy talkto
[3:01:37] <%AzureGale> Pat cut his collaborator off, the monster
[3:01:39] <%Deft_Thought> Midway through him giving the page URL
[3:01:39] <tolloponik> what LUL
[3:01:40] <%BoxNavy> @hrudzie_1 ye
[3:01:41] <%JumboCrunchies> Hahaha, no advertising!
[3:01:41] <%Deft_Thought> LUL
[3:01:44] <Blank9> it's alright for single player
[3:01:44] <+McDerpus> or shiny drop
[3:01:45] <%WhereIsWill> rip this mans plug LUL
[3:01:50] <%Deft_Thought> Pat was the real Khezu all along
[3:02:01] <%WhereIsWill> pat said no free clout!
[3:02:02] <tolloponik> slash what? LUL
[3:02:08] <Ravioli_Ronin> Surprised they didn’t set up a squad stream tbh
[3:02:10] <+allups> @hrudzie_1 i mostly played it single player but u are ganna want online for high rank quest
[3:02:11] <TheFramedWarlock> *** slash WHAT
[3:02:17] <JustaStove> @hrudzie_1 Yes because its all doable in single both village and hub quest
[3:02:25] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Devbob98) (warning)
[3:02:46] <cherrycottontail> @Ravioli_Ronin you can't unless everyones partner
[3:03:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> @cherrycottontail geez, hope they don’t keep it behind that wall forever
[3:03:44] <Theoyveyman> Anyone else hate how Rajang just kinda naps in one spot the whole quest?
[3:04:01] <jcflyguy> I just hate Rajang.
[3:04:28] <mybigmeech> So like did anyone get moved to a music stream or was that just me?
[3:04:30] <$JojoPiero> Rajang isn't that hard this time around, I had more trouble in World than Rise with it
[3:04:35] <DianaTheAscian> i'm glad his ass stays asleep the whole time
[3:06:25] <butthurtdave> yeah he's much more difficult in World since you can't guard his Grabs and he's so much more aggro
[3:06:31] <keksisblyat> Man I can’t wait for the pc release of this game. It’s gonnna be so good
[3:06:36] <butthurtdave> also how he can grab you off him
[3:07:14] <$JojoPiero> Yea giving us the Clutch Claw as a main mechanic for IB, and then making him basically immune to it was really fun lmao
[3:07:46] <DianaTheAscian> surprised its getting a pc release
[3:07:48] <$Afterman_> just random but uhhh fuck steven crowder
[3:08:11] <DianaTheAscian> who?
[3:08:31] <butthurtdave> only thing i miss about clutch claw was the tenderizing part to it, softening up hard parts on monsters made me feel like I was helping the team out a lot
[3:08:42] <+allups> @afterman u mean the asshat that dresses like nathen drake
[3:09:13] <keksisblyat> I’m more suprized that the pc confirmation want also a ps5 and Xbox one as well
[3:09:16] <$Afterman_> @allups he did a "george floyd challenge" by having an employee of his dress up, and kneel on crowder's back in a "reenactment"
[3:09:19] <dan_g_v> .. what was that sound?
[3:09:31] <PanicSwytch> What was that bitch scream?
[3:09:35] <Psyramics> @butthurtdave maybe if it didn't feel mandatory in order to do good damage
[3:09:36] <$Afterman_> bitch couldnt even let his employee kneel on his neck, it was his shoulders/back the entire time.
[3:09:42] <+allups> @Afterman_ yeah he is a POS
[3:10:04] <Daniel_Is_I> Can't go wrong with Attack Boost
[3:10:19] <butthurtdave> Quick Sheathe feels almost mandatory for LS now
[3:10:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you need a HR weapon
[3:10:27] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt if youre interested in a good party weapon, check out gaijinhunter's hunting horn video
[3:10:33] <mybigmeech> Attack boost is better than crit boost in this game
[3:10:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Quick Sheathe 3 is bonkers
[3:10:43] <mybigmeech> Or at least preferable
[3:10:44] <Daniel_Is_I> Quick Sheathe IS mandatory for LS now. It's too good to pass up.
[3:10:44] <SovPho> is it?
[3:10:48] <%MisterTylerrr> Yea
[3:10:48] <+TheBitingIrish> on LS, I mean
[3:10:52] <+MaxInaba> quick sheath and crit draw
[3:10:53] <BlueSpartan119> quick sheathe is super good
[3:10:54] <Daniel_Is_I> Quick Sheathe drastically speeds up special sheathe speed now
[3:10:57] <Chimeraelite> Yes for the Sheathe Parry
[3:10:58] <+MaxInaba> because they have the special sheath
[3:10:58] <%BoxNavy> that iai move
[3:11:01] <butthurtdave> cuz of the one sheathe move they have
[3:11:02] <+skylerpilot> speeds up Iai stance
[3:11:03] <%JumboCrunchies> It effects your special sheathe as well
[3:11:04] <SovPho> oh
[3:11:04] <Daniel_Is_I> Crit draw is GARBAGE now, don't use crit draw.
[3:11:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Iai stance
[3:11:08] <%AgniBrandt> Quick sheath affects how fast your sheath for Iai
[3:11:11] <DianaTheAscian> oh cool
[3:11:11] <koffeemancer> Weeb stance
[3:11:13] <BlueSpartan119> Iai sheathe is like Vergil fast
[3:11:17] <%MisterTylerrr> Cause it has an unsheathe weapon skill that's really good too
[3:11:28] <SovPho> TFW YOU GET 0 DANGO TRAITS
[3:11:28] <BlueSpartan119> they fucken MURDERED Crit Draw
[3:11:35] <MadamePixieStix> risuruTailsdoll risuruTailsdoll risuruTailsdoll
[3:11:35] <PanicSwytch> LICK MORE
[3:11:39] <+Dorf1> crit draw gives less affinity but its a timed buff so itsstill good with narga gs
[3:11:57] <Daniel_Is_I> @Dorf1 It lasts 1-3 seconds and goes away when you dodge. Crit draw is awful now.
[3:12:01] <Devbob98> Quentin Tarantino dog
[3:12:02] <butthurtdave> What HR does the GOOD melding unlock? it's not at the ass end of HR is it?
[3:12:16] <mybigmeech> Nah it is
[3:12:29] <+McDerpus> it is butthurt
[3:12:30] <mybigmeech> Have to beat story for last melding thing
[3:12:31] <$Afterman_> im p sure it is at the end
[3:12:31] <SovPho> Melding is fucking expensive
[3:12:37] <+Dorf1> @Daniel_Is_I it lasts long enough for the greatsword combo
[3:12:42] <$Afterman_> cause im almost to 7 star but havent gotten any great ones
[3:12:54] <stormhawk9891> Rathian CB is weird in this game since it's an element phial type instead of Impact
[3:12:59] <%radregice> rip pat
[3:12:59] <$Afterman_> @SovPho check out gaijinhunter's zenny video. you can get like..300k super fast
[3:13:04] <%AzureGale> ATTACK OF THE DOG
[3:13:10] <butthurtdave> Yee, I've been running Rampages to get the mats for it but rampages aren't as fun as regular hunts
[3:13:12] <%BoxNavy> pat dies on stream r.i.p.
[3:13:18] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:13:22] <dan_g_v> Zangief is taking over the stream!
[3:13:24] <Oxybe> LUL
[3:13:26] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[3:13:26] <%BoxNavy> hes griefing you super hard
[3:13:27] <mike2hands> what is happening?
[3:13:27] <+EriksBlue> daw
[3:13:31] <PanicSwytch> Gief Stares at MH
[3:13:33] <+red_cuppa> zangief really sent you to die
[3:13:34] <+allups> WHAT A FAT BOY I LOVE HIM
[3:13:36] <+MayorRev> Ninjala is having a MonHun Rise collab
[3:13:39] <%Wallabri> ZANGREIF'D
[3:13:40] <butthurtdave> DO IT COWARD
[3:13:40] <%AzureGale> Zangrief
[3:13:41] <Oxybe> Geif greif'd
[3:13:42] <+allups> the dog is cute too
[3:13:46] <dan_g_v> First twitter, now the stream, what comes next for this dog?!
[3:13:58] <butthurtdave> You can send out a join request mid quest still right?
[3:14:00] <+Celarious> HE'S SO CHONK I LOVE HIM HE'S GROWN SO MUCH
[3:14:01] <wolfen091> so when does gief make twitch partner?
[3:14:09] <Srthunda> dont worry pat, everyone will send you their energy
[3:14:27] <dan_g_v> hopes and prayers for this boy
[3:14:50] <dan_g_v> he's Pat
[3:14:55] <butthurtdave> Not gonna rock Diablos with its godly raw damage?
[3:15:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Not ALL of them but most of them
[3:15:03] <%BoxNavy> i think some of the goss harag weapons are supposed to be really good too?
[3:15:10] <+McDerpus> Nargacuga isn't strictly the best, but it's solid in all situations
[3:15:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Switch Axe's best one isn't narga
[3:15:16] <+Gespens> tbh, Narga weapons have usually been pretty dope for most of the games its been it, in my experience
[3:15:17] <@Mechz71> Mike's special stuff?
[3:15:21] <mike2hands> whiff boss
[3:15:39] <butthurtdave> There's a Narga subspecies isnt there?
[3:15:43] <+McDerpus> also, Nargacuga Switchaxe is actually kinda bad
[3:15:44] <mike2hands> wait they can join your quest after you enter>>
[3:16:01] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Nargacuga GS with crit draw and crit boost is good
[3:16:15] <$Afterman_> do you guys think @PatStaresAt is gonna by Intel's N word audio remover program?
[3:16:21] <+allups> where are the giant monster fighting games at
[3:16:22] <+McDerpus> no reason to run crit draw over weakness exploit
[3:16:28] <butthurtdave> Does that ever work Pat?
[3:16:33] <+McDerpus> crit draw just got shit on hard in this game
[3:16:45] <%AzureGale> LET IT RIP
[3:16:53] <dan_g_v> that's how snow works!
[3:17:00] <%Agami23> beyblades can also bring back the dead in the manga
[3:17:02] <%BoxNavy> @Afterman_ mondays podcast is gonna be fun
[3:17:02] <$Dakuu75> Let it rip & tear, until it is done.
[3:17:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat can cap all the monsters using his enormous cavernous asshole
[3:17:08] <mike2hands> is the ghost of paige
[3:17:09] <Theoyveyman> When Beyblades turn people into scalies
[3:17:09] <dan_g_v> Zangief is looking at the code of the simulation, Pat
[3:17:12] <+allups> useful dog skill to have
[3:17:16] <PanicSwytch> Its Abraham Lincoln
[3:17:27] <keksisblyat> So is mounting not in this game or is Pat just not getting mounts?
[3:17:28] <mike2hands> IS LINCOLN!!!
[3:17:30] <penitentpendant> Your dog is just arguing with their Inland Empire, it's all good
[3:17:31] <Radioactivetaco9> isnt it haunted by the ghost of abraham lincoln
[3:17:34] <%AzureGale> I know ghost hunting, I've played Phasmaphobia
[3:17:42] <+allups> lol
[3:17:43] <BlueLunecy> My dear hunting mates decided to engage the rajang sleeping in out HR5 Pukei hunt
[3:17:50] <dan_g_v> accurate
[3:17:53] <$Afterman_> @keksisblyat mounting is replaced with monster riding and piloting
[3:17:55] <%BoxNavy> wow pat his spot just exploded
[3:17:56] <dan_g_v> find the bird!
[3:18:00] <butthurtdave> Hey it's that dog
[3:18:19] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @keksisblyat you get to fight monsters with another monster
[3:18:24] <keksisblyat> @afterman_ Ah ok, thanks
[3:18:28] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt his official title is Van Bitch, put some respect on his name.
[3:18:40] <MoonKing> waking up rajang is a legit strategy to get easy riding damage on the actual target
[3:18:51] <+Catpurnicus> Van Bitch Professional
[3:19:03] <mike2hands> THE SEE M
[3:19:05] <Radioactivetaco9> wyvern was executed really well tbh. being able to ride into battle on a rajang and animation cancel laser beams is sick as hell
[3:19:15] <%shurtal> Plz, Van Bitch is his father's name, he prefers Van SUV
[3:19:24] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Rajang is the laziest invader
[3:19:33] <%shurtal> SUV Bitch, goddamnit
[3:19:47] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> dood sleeps every day
[3:19:48] <Theoyveyman> @moonking But isn't it far safer & easier to use any other monster in the quest?
[3:19:51] <butthurtdave> I really hope that Bagel returns, he'd be hilarious to mount
[3:19:57] <%AncelDeLambert> rapid rabbit?
[3:20:05] <dan_g_v> always an useful skill
[3:20:16] <%AncelDeLambert> mammal wyverns are their own thing
[3:20:27] <MoonKing> @theoyveyman, yeah but it's way cooler to make monkey trouble
[3:20:56] <%Monkeyweed21> mammal wyverns are called Fanged Wyverns @AncelDeLambert
[3:21:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @AncelDeLambert this cant be rapid rabbit, it doesn't have a horny girlfriend
[3:21:24] <butthurtdave> THE CAT
[3:21:28] <%AncelDeLambert> it's weird to call a Bulfango a "Fanged Wyvern"
[3:21:36] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:21:42] <+MF_C00M> LUL
[3:21:44] <Radioactivetaco9> capcom did some serious black magic when making the RE engine
[3:21:45] <butthurtdave> Has Pat EVER landed the good wake up hit on stream?
[3:21:54] <%AncelDeLambert> why
[3:22:01] <jcflyguy> Last hunt, hit 905.
[3:22:09] <%logoth_> Because you killed his entire family
[3:22:17] <Theoyveyman> Fuck off, there's no way Bullfango is a fanged wyvern
[3:22:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear, Iceborne fucked up the distances somehow, I could never properly wake-up on GS in it
[3:22:35] <Kaji04> so small monsters are now synched too?
[3:22:39] <Blank9> the slow steady progress of monster hunter game to game
[3:22:45] <+SPplayer> what made you choose english over monster hunter language?
[3:22:59] <Radioactivetaco9> also helpful tip. The ZL+X wirebug move recharges faster then the ZL+ZR one
[3:23:00] <butthurtdave> English is better for streaming
[3:23:05] <MoonKing> no no, straight up mammals are fanged BEASTS. mammal wyverns like zinogre are fanged wyverns
[3:23:36] <korpocalypse> thank you for clearing that up @MoonKing
[3:23:42] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:23:43] <butthurtdave> MMHMM
[3:24:27] <josemoya95> I think most fanged wyverns are still reptiles, except maybe Zinogre
[3:24:37] <dan_g_v> have a taste of waawaawah!
[3:24:48] <Srthunda> khezu has no eyes and must scream
[3:24:49] <Theoyveyman> MH lore is a mess
[3:24:53] <%Gunslinger200> Gunslinger200 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:24:57] <butthurtdave> Yee it works for Rajang's laser too
[3:25:06] <AllenDeadman> oof
[3:25:09] <SovPho> no one talks about the genetic monstrosities that the hunters are
[3:25:09] <%AzureGale> ded
[3:25:10] <dan_g_v> Imagine carting to Khezu
[3:25:11] <+abrupt_abe> F
[3:25:14] <Srthunda> what a bad hunter
[3:25:15] <Zooperton> monster hunter has lore?
[3:25:17] <+Dova573> the Khezu Classic
[3:25:21] <heckengine> meme khezu cart
[3:25:23] <Theoyveyman> YOU TOOK THE WHOLE COCK
[3:25:28] <%Bluwizard21> MH PRO
[3:25:30] <%Monkeyweed21> wow pat sucks at mh
[3:25:31] <butthurtdave> Oh wow your Health and Stamina dont drop back down to default after carting?
[3:25:33] <+allups> Pat what a fucking pro
[3:25:37] <%Paperware> Pat got killed on his back by a penis monster
[3:25:38] <+Kduff89> cart and restart Kapp
[3:25:42] <Kaji04> Hit the weakspot for massive damage
[3:25:42] <dan_g_v> Best monster hunter player dies to Khezu
[3:25:52] <%MugenSandan> So never play Great Sword got it
[3:25:54] <+Catpurnicus> don't ever capture or chat will yell at you
[3:25:58] <dan_g_v> beaten by endemic life
[3:26:07] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> lost to pinwheel
[3:26:17] <dan_g_v> taking a double pounding
[3:26:23] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[3:26:26] <outis94> Having flash backs to your younth?
[3:26:28] <+Dova573> You know its kinda upsetting to kart to khezu with all the rise extra moves
[3:26:29] <+mechslayer71> @mugensandan just came in and your comment was the first to appear, wha happen?
[3:26:31] <%codedoomboy> codedoomboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Pat the great sword master SeemsGood
[3:26:43] <%SirGO0SE> wiff wiff wiffadelphia
[3:26:59] <butthurtdave> So is it safe to assume Paige will go GS if she ever commits to the MH coop with Pat?
[3:27:07] <+Dova573> Or maybe this just proves Khezu was always cheap
[3:27:07] <%valriot> Does Pat know he can hold down Adamant Slash?
[3:27:14] <+MF_C00M> LUL
[3:27:42] <+mechslayer71> @patstaresat you can power sheathe out of the TCS end lag
[3:27:45] <@Mechz71> Game is called Monster HUNTER not Monster Capturer
[3:27:51] <%valriot> The air one just felt bad to me, idk
[3:27:55] <Blank9> paige should go hammer
