[0:46:41] <%shurtal> add up to 501 points
[0:46:42] <scarman125> time to learn
[0:46:43] <bakkatohri> One that annoys me about the main Yakuza series is that they lock moves and force you to train under masters. Like can you imagine if moves were locked under MTX? It's not quite that bad, but it's close.
[0:46:45] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt you start with 301 points and you try to hit exactly 0
[0:46:47] <%baka_sugoi> Count down to exactly zero Pat

[2:04:55] <%amaranthos> Yakoozies <3
[2:05:06] <linapanther> @thelonechris IKR
[2:05:11] <Airuzen> man this is making me realize how MUCH potential they have for Yakuza spinoff games, they could really just take this formula and make a DRAMATICALLY different feeling game
[2:05:13] <%Deekman> Yagami got that Fortnite back bling
[2:05:40] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> smoosh those burgers
[2:05:50] <adamant1333> mario party
[2:05:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> It's a cool way to make extra content using the same engine/assets/mechanics
[2:06:06] <+CherteuseKapibara> this is such a video game
[2:06:21] <%Deekman> I love this so much more than like a dragon
[2:06:26] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[2:06:42] <blastazoid00> These mini games are awesome
[2:07:01] <Brandon__Brando> im glad they threw kiryu in the trash for this
[2:07:05] <teefpal> "What if we just make as many different games as possible and put them in our gritty crime J-drama?"
[2:07:17] <Saltmeisterr> this definitely is longer than ichiban confections tho
[2:07:20] <+genepark> Ive been making my way thru LAD too now finally
[2:07:37] <teefpal> ichi is a good boy
[2:07:44] <h0wiewong> Kiryu and Ichiban had to run a business, and Yagami's here playing Mario Party

[2:10:53] <LoneFonte> @Undenizen yeah, man. you also missed the ninja schoold feud arc
[2:10:59] <MechanizedGentleman> I wish I could make 3 grand playing a free VR game :/
[2:11:00] <%TourettesPlays> I know its yen and all but this seems like an obscene amount of money
[2:11:17] <%zanz_san> holy shit

[2:11:29] <Elsewize> Like 300 dollars or something, right?

[2:11:40] <@QueequegTheater> "We need more Vergils"
[2:11:45] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I thought it was Dyson Cube at first
[2:11:48] <cervidaequus> Yakuza devs just put Cyberpunk into their game as a minigame and made it good
[2:11:55] <%zanz_san> like 3000 usd
[2:12:00] <Brandon__Brando> do it again
[2:12:03] <%JonathLP> Is there a Dyson Sphere game?

[2:14:03] <thelonechris> "I did some grinding off stream."
[2:14:04] <%linSP> i cant believe gief is melted
[2:14:24] <devanmuse> @shurtal Oh, I love that song
[2:14:25] <+genepark> Yes screw the drone races
[2:14:26] <Blank9> I did all drone races first person to pretend it was star wars podracer
[2:14:30] <DusK_The_Stray> Drone Race, but with kites
[2:14:37] <+fetrigon> oh, I guess ufo quest is its own thing.
[2:14:41] <studleydoorite> these idle animations exude excitement
[2:14:51] <willyfreshness> BUT WHERES KITES THO
[2:14:52] <%Monkeyweed21> CREW CUT
[2:14:53] <%twistedj3ster> but don't let them mix
[2:15:03] <%akaAxi0m> Alexa. Play GUNSHIP - Drone Racing League
[2:15:11] <ghosrevan> now this is drone racing
[2:15:12] <artoflec> what about the Amon fights
[2:15:21] <studleydoorite> fly it straight to the pawn shop
[2:15:21] <%zeroarturia> Even Yakuza 3 fishing game?
[2:15:25] <%Piemen99> Sounds like pat being a bitch Kappa
[2:15:26] <Brandon__Brando> I feel like when the devs know what kite battles are its going to be a mini game asap
[2:15:29] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt did you save between each race?
[2:15:40] <+fetrigon> ah shit this sounds good

[2:15:56] <ghosrevan> pat the lier
[2:16:02] <linapanther> man of all yakuza minigames, i loved the pocket car racing
[2:16:03] <artoflec> well this is pre upgrades
[2:16:11] <artoflec> the drone racing in judgment 1 gets CRAZY at the end
[2:16:13] <%baka_sugoi> C O O L
[2:16:15] <ghosrevan> r1
[2:16:16] <Astrophizz> the Yakuza 3 fishing game is harder at 60fps because the timings are twice as fast
[2:16:29] <circular7> harder then pocket racing in 1, because you hated that shit pat
[2:16:32] <%Deekman> Even the Yakuza 3 golf game you have to play 2 perfect games on to unlock a substory?
[2:16:51] <akitanito> is that diago's fault
[2:16:52] <Brandon__Brando> wow the water looks great
[2:17:02] <%strakillias> Through the school?

[2:18:27] <h0wiewong> That's just Nahobino
[2:18:28] <CatRidder> YAGAMI for smash
[2:18:30] <@Ranryu692> there already is an SMT character, Joker
[2:18:31] <MechanizedGentleman> an SMT character? like Dante?
[2:18:31] <Pt_Kamen> FORTNITE Man!
[2:18:32] <%linSP> SMT 5 protag would be neat
[2:18:33] <draca23> Give me Ryu from Breath of Fire JUST FOR ME and no one else.
[2:18:34] <%polothegreatest> unceremonially?
[2:18:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> im lowering my expectations to New Fire Emblem character, or John Fortnut
[2:18:42] <Saltmeisterr> I NEED MY ADVANCE WARS
[2:18:43] <akitanito> SMT V protag would be great
[2:18:43] <%thedankestmeeme> if its John Halo I will get BACK into smash
[2:18:43] <Sp3ctre48> oof
[2:18:45] <artoflec> if its sora ill just be impressed that they made it happen
[2:18:45] <%megadblitz> its the final character so they have to be the least wanted character EVER
[2:18:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> I JUST WANT SOMETHING OBSCURE!
[2:18:49] <%cooldude69xx> Like Joker, or Dante
[2:18:50] <teefpal> FORTNITE would be great for salt production
[2:18:55] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Blanka confirmed for Smash
[2:18:55] <@Ranryu692> isn't it technically SMT Persona 5
[2:18:56] <studleydoorite> is that a chicken's head mounted on the drone

[2:19:07] <ghosrevan> maybe another ff7 charahcter
[2:19:08] <%Puhff> Jack Frost for Smash
[2:19:08] <%greasypete00> it wouldnt be dante
[2:19:10] <Zeif00> Joker is a Persona character
[2:19:11] <%JoshManVGH> Legend of Zelda 2 Link
[2:19:12] <%machshop> what if it's Cubivore
[2:19:13] <devanmuse> Dante has already been deconfirmed, tho
[2:19:14] <artoflec> we had our chance at Dante Pat elaPain
[2:19:14] <%chiazam> VERGIL OR NERO?
[2:19:14] <LoneFonte> Scrimblo Bimblo!
[2:19:15] <%SaiyanShoto> As much as I want Sora he’s not gonna be in Smash, Sephiroth was Soras replacement
[2:19:17] <CatRidder> but dante is already in smash
[2:19:17] <heli0hso> A shooter character would be cool
[2:19:19] <%shurtal> What if it's Civ Ghandi?
[2:19:19] <%athuramn> it's gonna be the new tales character
[2:19:20] <%Monkeyweed21> but Dante is also a loser
[2:19:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> what about Nero?
[2:19:23] <%RealThiele> Gwyn for smash LUL
[2:19:23] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Pat are you getting the 1 billion dollar Fortnite hoodie?
[2:19:24] <%greasypete00> even if it was crash i think people would be alright
[2:19:25] <Sp3ctre48> sorry Dante was executed live on stream last time
[2:19:25] <+Toshatron> They already cut dante with the mii costumes
[2:19:28] <Yuroshi> I hope it's Eliwood
[2:19:31] <Brandon__Brando> it was the worst part of slot cars in 0
[2:19:31] <+RogueCrocodile> Another Fire Emblem
[2:19:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Disney will not let sora in smash
[2:19:33] <mikeriffic> is playing as a Mii Dante not good enough for you @PatStaresAt  ?
[2:19:35] <%SaiyanShoto> What’re you talking about Dante is already in Smash Kappa
[2:19:35] <glunchboy> SOL BADGUY FOR SMASH

[2:19:46] <zerointelligence000> I want an ff14 character so bad because it won't happen
[2:19:46] <%stubborndeer> awww shit it's YAKUZA 3
[2:19:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> SOL would be a good pull
[2:19:48] <%GuilKato> Grinding in a single player game..... oh your mean some sort of Engine to make money in game Pat?
[2:19:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Dante is as much a character as Sans and Cuphead now Kappa
[2:19:56] <Pt_Kamen> It would be cool if it was the Morrigan Sprite
[2:20:03] <%ThomasOfTroy> How old is yagami?
[2:20:11] <teefpal> Hear me out; a Nickelodeon Character for Smash
[2:20:11] <toahmes> Someone said something about a Palico and I think that would be cool
[2:20:11] <%machshop> @teefpal i play it every year around christmas, love that weird game
[2:20:16] <%Piemen99> bet the next character is gonna be Sakurai himself
[2:20:19] <%blankwaffle> what if it's Nero though
[2:20:25] <%JoshManVGH> Doy you all think that any of the announcements will be some sort of direct response to the Nikilodean game?
[2:20:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> Jack-O doing her Crouching Idle as a assist trophy
[2:20:27] <%polothegreatest> LUL some friends says the will continue  dlc LUL
[2:20:34] <%RealThiele> Palico likely an assist trophy candidate
[2:20:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chosen Undead?
[2:20:37] <studleydoorite> if I ever evoke an exuberant fist pump from a stranger I'll consider my life worth it
[2:20:41] <%cooldude69xx> @blankwaffle Boo
[2:20:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> human flesh?
[2:20:51] <teefpal> @machshop Weird games like that and Chibi-Robo were my childhood, 100% that shit

[2:21:01] <%stubborndeer> stubborndeer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! This game looks great
[2:21:24] <%SaiyanShoto> The next Smash game is going to be disappointing after this one
[2:21:24] <%athuramn> his hair looks rad
[2:21:28] <%JoshManVGH> Nanbas lost cousin?

[2:22:32] <%stubborndeer> THEY MEAN UMAMI
[2:22:33] <%castlerock42> Such a lust for ramen.
[2:22:34] <ghosrevan> i miss ichiban
[2:22:38] <%stubborndeer> THERE IS NO JAPANESE WORD FOR UMAMI

[2:22:56] <%stubborndeer> Oh I just ruined the game
[2:22:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @stubborndeer wait....
[2:22:58] <teefpal> @stubborndeer :\ ???
[2:23:13] <%stubborndeer> It's like how there is no russian word for potato
[2:23:15] <%RealThiele> Buzz researcher sounds like a place where people hear about horse paste
[2:23:20] <studleydoorite> @stubborndeer he's right, look it up
[2:23:25] <%cooldude69xx> @blankwaffle Acceptable. He was cooler
[2:24:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> but "Potato" isn't a Russian word
[2:24:12] <%stubborndeer> Cat ramen means that it is almost powder
[2:24:14] <%stubborndeer> so dry
[2:24:16] <+CynicalCobalt> Why isnt the game shitting itself like Deadly Prem 2
[2:24:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Fuck yeah, Cat ramen

[2:24:38] <DXLelouch24> again
[2:24:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> @CynicalCobalt Cause the people who make the game are good at making games
[2:24:43] <+sixcubit> ramen made of cats is only 35% forbidden. we can get WAY more forbidden then that
[2:24:48] <%stubborndeer> IF you ask for CAT ramen they will give you the dryest ramen, IF you ask for cat RAMEN they will shoot you (police officer)
[2:24:51] <Pt_Kamen> catnip ramen
[2:24:54] <+VoytekBus> rameown
[2:24:56] <MechanizedGentleman> delicious cat-hair ramen
[2:25:15] <studleydoorite> unless the mayor cat is being paid to look the other way and tell the populace there's nothing wrong
[2:25:34] <%blankwaffle> @cynicalcobalt deadly p is too good for a playable frame rate
[2:25:36] <+teh_rawk> can yagami do sick tricks?
[2:25:38] <+sixcubit> @studleydoorite catitalism
[2:25:39] <%stubborndeer> You mean the LORD cat (Japanese fuedal system)
[2:25:40] <Pt_Kamen> hot wet pussy-cats
[2:25:43] <%castlerock42> There's a main story?
[2:25:54] <@ssjklyco> More games should take place in essentially the same map with new stories and major changes to the map.
[2:25:55] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @teh_rawk Shit yeah he can
[2:25:56] <%RealThiele> murder? no. Ramen? Yes
[2:25:57] <jorniev> new chad lore, the chad guys face is the same shape as the country of CHAD
[2:25:57] <%stubborndeer> There are 7 Lord cats per province, constantly vying for supremecy
[2:25:58] <studleydoorite> @studleydoorite LUL
[2:26:04] <%PhantomMiG> That women went through that wall
[2:26:31] <Pt_Kamen> means ball
[2:26:34] <MechanizedGentleman> ain't tama that cat who ran a train station?
[2:26:35] <%cooldude69xx> Fido?
[2:26:39] <studleydoorite> I don't like how the reply feature makes it look like I'm LUL in my own joke
[2:26:43] <devanmuse> I bet you're supposed to search the keyword CAT in order to find it
[2:26:45] <%justcallmebobplease> Oh man, I need to step away for like half an hour - where the FUCK is this game going to be that long from now?
[2:27:00] <%castlerock42> This is just gonna be a dude selling fishy ramen, isn't it?
[2:27:03] <%justcallmebobplease> I bet it'll be on the moon, fighting Mr. Shakedown.
[2:27:05] <@ssjklyco> They are now CAT atonic
[2:27:08] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat have you found your Judgement yet?
[2:27:09] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Leave me alone bullies, i gotta learn Cat lore
[2:27:15] <maybefalco> thats an amazing heat action holy shit

[2:27:26] <%RealThiele> salty
[2:27:28] <RaidenRising> cat lore cat lore
[2:27:38] <%stubborndeer> Always drink beer with your ramen or the japanese will think you are a westerner and shoot you
[2:27:40] <%MugenSandan> a man just disappeared
[2:27:41] <+sixcubit> yell at pedestrians in real life to speed up their conversations because you're bored
[2:27:47] <%PhantomMiG> That man was a ghost
[2:27:49] <studleydoorite> quantum ramen :0
[2:28:04] <studleydoorite> quantum ramoon :0
[2:28:06] <+sixcubit> envious, pat?
[2:28:08] <%stubborndeer> That man was foolish enough to order the "literally kills you ramen"
[2:28:10] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Shoutcast the dog piss
[2:28:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> they should wear pants
[2:28:15] <%DoubleRrico> that would be worse
[2:28:19] <ghosrevan> gief needs more power
[2:28:27] <maybefalco> but which way do they wear pants
[2:28:29] <%Puhff> That's why I got a girl dog
[2:28:30] <smoothwood07> yeah they would be full of pee
[2:28:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> We need to kickstart pants for Gief
[2:28:39] <%MidnightBurst12> they would shit their pants every 3 hours
[2:28:40] <teefpal> Gief needs draining
[2:28:42] <%grimr2004> what in the heck is this?
[2:28:49] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> gief should wear shorts like his namesake
[2:28:50] <ghosrevan> @maybefalco on the back legs
[2:28:54] <%grimr2004> ohh
[2:29:01] <%TourettesPlays> Will twitch ban you if your pets genitals show up on camera??? Probably right????
[2:29:17] <%DoubleRrico> but they'd basically be in their underwear
[2:29:23] <%blankwaffle> my dog has bushy hind leg hair so it looks like she's wearing pants
[2:30:04] <%TourettesPlays> Why is it that whenever a dog shows up in an animated japanese thing their butthole is always visible, like Amateratsu?
[2:30:19] <@Ranryu692> @TourettesPlays realism
[2:30:27] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> We should breed dogs to give them naturally occurring leg hair-pants
[2:30:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> its always a *
[2:30:40] <%blankwaffle> @tourettesplays I don't trust things without butt holes
[2:30:58] <%DoubleRrico> needs 2 layers or they're walking around in their underwear which seems worse somehow

[2:35:42] <%stubborndeer> Your dog came on cam and just rolled around for an hour
[2:35:51] <%stubborndeer> It was cool
[2:35:59] <ghosrevan> gief can't lick his nuts and we were lamenting for gim

[2:36:49] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Joe Mama!
[2:37:02] <@Ranryu692> Gief can't lick his nuts because his tongue can't reach the vet's dumpster
[2:37:14] <%TourettesPlays> That guy was literally on the ground begging for mercy pat

[2:52:30] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> i got lost and confused trying to change subway lines in tokyo, because they belonged to different rail companies and required exiting one station and finding the other
[2:52:30] <medoodoo> wow pat , really tried your luck at that high end clothing sore looking for ctfood

[3:09:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JustAnotherTrapArtist yeah its just a british joke on texas
[3:09:35] <h0wiewong> Fuck you're right
[3:09:35] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I fucking love Watamote so much
[3:09:36] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> yagami just having a freak out with chairs
[3:09:36] <%Ynkubus_> oh no
[3:09:36] <%Monkeyweed21> when she does that awful duck face
[3:09:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> YES
[3:09:39] <+kewlmyc> That show is processed cringe
[3:09:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BURGER
[3:09:49] <%polothegreatest> that series is hated there
[3:09:49] <%bevyrage> that burger is evil
[3:09:51] <teefpal> Isn't this where Ichiban met the orphan in YAD
[3:09:53] <+tetraes> the series transitioned hard into yuri funtimes lol
[3:09:55] <%chiazam> What show is that?
[3:09:56] <Brandon__Brando> what a opener
[3:09:58] <MechanizedGentleman> that burger is horrifying
[3:10:01] <jorniev> OOOOOOF
[3:10:03] <LoneFonte> same
[3:10:05] <teefpal> Never heard of it
[3:10:07] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> watamote hurts me soul
[3:10:08] <ErikFeral> Dinosuar!?!?!
[3:10:08] <+BigCoffee> Watamote evolves later and the girl's actually popular and has good close friends
[3:10:09] <Dr_Mooose> it hits hard
[3:10:11] <fIashman92> @chiazam Watamote
[3:10:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> burgr
[3:10:12] <+kewlmyc> I feel the same
[3:10:13] <%DianaTheAscian> That show is amazing and painful @PatStaresAt
[3:10:14] <Blank9> nathan for you series finale
[3:10:15] <MechanizedGentleman> it was very difficult to watch
[3:10:16] <+BigCoffee> after the anime
[3:10:17] <%Piemono> That shit is too real
[3:10:17] <%barrakuta371> it's supposed to, isnt it?
[3:10:18] <Brandon__Brando> I cant watch it ive only heard things and I refuse to watch it
[3:10:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its pretty good
[3:10:26] <%kingmemelord97> oh Christ wtf is that
[3:10:29] <+BigCoffee> Read it, it's better then the anime
[3:10:34] <fusedforms> I get strong second-hand embarrassment so I've never dared to watch lol
[3:10:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> bugr
[3:10:37] <jorniev> i could not finish that series
[3:10:40] <%DianaTheAscian> I read the Manga mostly
[3:10:40] <%Bt_Robot> I want the CHEESE
[3:10:41] <%TourettesPlays> same except it was Welcome To NHK and Chunnibyou
[3:10:45] <%cooldude69xx> Oh MY GOD
[3:10:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> im sensitive to cringe only pat cringe for me
[3:10:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @PatStaresAt Ever catch up on the Watamote Manga? Shit's pretty good
[3:10:54] <teefpal> Oh I remember this, I read the manga when it was popular on 4chan
[3:10:57] <+BigCoffee> I realize that Japan is kinda like the US, where they mostly only speak 1 language, and really don't give a rats ass about learning anything else. But one's the world wide trading language everyone else is forced to learn....and japanese is....well...
[3:11:06] <%Bt_Robot> "Give me the PIZZA"
[3:11:07] <jorniev> WELCOME TO BHK is that too
[3:11:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> UMA
[3:11:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> GOLDLEWIS
[3:11:17] <jorniev> NHK i meant
[3:11:24] <%chiazam> Oh fuck is that the anime with that no sleep eyes girl
[3:11:24] <+Take_2_shots> I'm not saying it was Aliens but...
[3:11:27] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @BigCoffee Learning Japanese is challenge mode for most as well
[3:11:27] <+BigCoffee> UMA Rabbit of Inaba
[3:11:37] <teefpal> Somewhere Vinesauce Joel is shaking
[3:11:38] <Brandon__Brando> wait ufo's are now in this game
[3:11:42] <jorniev> ITS NOT A BIG DEAL?
[3:11:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @chiazam yes
[3:11:47] <+BigCoffee> @chiazam yeah, adnd later after 1 good event she starts getting friends, and doesn't get why people like her
[3:11:47] <%cooldude69xx> @BigCoffee There's a sizable spanish speaking population in america
[3:12:00] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @chiazam Yeah, no sleep only play BL Visual novels
[3:12:20] <+BigCoffee> @BigCoffee Honestly I wish I knew when I was a preteen. I learned english by myself as a second language by playing ff6 and watching digimon
[3:12:23] <shameimarusen> all in
[3:12:31] <ianabstract> Time for him to become a UFO-catcher
[3:12:38] <@Spydurman> Blink 182 is the opener for the event announcing our new alien overlords
[3:12:41] <+BigCoffee> @BigCoffee I know but everyone not spanish or similar only knows english
[3:12:49] <camelwizard> This music is smooooooth
[3:13:07] <+RogueCrocodile> Oh I remember this from a different stream, this is good
[3:13:19] <%cooldude69xx> @BigCoffee It blows my mind (in a good way) how often I hear about people learning languages from games and TV
[3:13:27] <%castlerock42> I don't think things would be that shaken up in the Yakuza universe if you found a real UFO.
[3:13:37] <jorniev> watamote turned into a harem right but with the cringe still?
[3:13:43] <%notsoy> at least they apparently give you options to spend SP later on
[3:13:46] <Blank9> more skills will make combat faster to get more sp too
[3:13:53] <+BigCoffee> @BigCoffee I had to learn english to play the rpg or else I wasn't sure of what to do. I played ff6 when I was 6 and I'm french
[3:14:02] <+BigCoffee> I was bilingual when I was 11
[3:14:07] <%Monkeyweed21> At least Watamote isnt as bad as welcome to the NHK
[3:14:15] <+BigCoffee> I just aced everythign english until college
[3:14:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> as@cooldude69xx dude I perfected my English by listening to English Gatchaman and my birth dad learned through listening to James Brown
[3:14:16] <%chiazam> I ALWAYS go from lowest cost to highest cost
[3:14:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> know whats funny when the US was releasing information on their UFO encounters they revealed that roswell was a secret microphone experiment meaning what kicked off the alien craze was a cold war microphone
[3:14:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SCARAB LOL
[3:14:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> @monkeyweed21 ok I keep hearing NHK is bad, like cringe bad or depressing bad?
[3:14:37] <%polothegreatest> god saw nhk, it was bad
[3:14:45] <+Indigo_909> I apparently came out of the womb speaking Spanish, yet I have no recollection of it and thought I always learned English first
[3:14:46] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @jorniev Yup, the gang is a bunch of weirdos in their own ways
[3:14:50] <%notsoy> that was the park where you found the invincible masochist
[3:14:59] <teefpal> Weren't all those recent UVA things proven to be radar glitches?
[3:15:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @GalacticaPhanto "c'mon man, you're too pathetic to commit suicide" is a real phrase from it
[3:15:18] <medoodoo> no worry about it
[3:15:22] <akitanito> probably yeah
[3:15:28] <%TourettesPlays> Pat what are your opinions on life on other planets vis a vis their existence and possible probing of our women?
[3:15:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> @monkeyweed21 oh. that's bad
[3:15:29] <jorniev> welcome to the NHK gets really bad when the main dude gets addicted to porn and MMOs
[3:15:32] <+BigCoffee> Yakuza 7 had ghosts
[3:15:34] <+pupil31> monkaS
[3:15:34] <JetpackMcQuack> that's the one
[3:15:45] <+BigCoffee> @TourettesPlays read Dandadan for that
[3:15:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @GalacticaPhanto ITS ROUGH SHIT
[3:15:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's like 20ft up lol it's tiny
[3:15:51] <%polothegreatest> pururin psaMenace psaMenace
[3:15:56] <%cooldude69xx> @BigCoffee Well, good on you. That's way more languages than I know
[3:15:57] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> welp my net is dying, good bye chat <3
[3:16:11] <ohno778> ZERO SHOT
[3:16:12] <jorniev> YO dandandan is SO goood
[3:16:23] <studleydoorite> I feel like you really want "includes the UFO"
[3:16:32] <studleydoorite> like that should be in Excellent
[3:16:40] <%DianaTheAscian> bull
[3:16:40] <%shootbang_exe> @PatStaresAt do you think crane style feels any better? It still feels kinda not great
[3:16:47] <%chiazam> Not in focus
[3:17:11] <+pupil31> EZ
[3:17:13] <+the_drummaestro> that's a small UFO
[3:17:14] <akitanito> good jerb
[3:17:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> its small
[3:17:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> that could totally be interperted as a light
[3:17:47] <loukemia83> Is this a sequel to Judgement or an update?
[3:18:06] <akitanito> UFO is just NTR
[3:18:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> @loukemia83 sequel
[3:18:34] <h0wiewong> Adding the entirety of Ijincho would be a hell of an update
[3:18:45] <%Bt_Robot> That girl is an alien trying to throw you off the track!  Capture her!
[3:19:08] <%Monkeyweed21> REUBEN LANGDON NO
[3:19:10] <HeroToxiko> TheIlluminati
[3:19:15] <%cooldude69xx> Pat must go back in time and defeat his UFO enthusiasm
[3:19:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> SHES COVERING IT UP
[3:19:26] <+pupil31> SourPls
[3:19:41] <%castlerock42> See, now I feel that they're real.
[3:19:44] <Brandon__Brando> thats what happens with people with ufos they get REALLY into them
[3:19:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yeah Yagami can just hire Pat's dad to tell him how dumb UFO stuff is
[3:19:53] <medoodoo> " hahahah :
[3:20:03] <%Axellogic> I have to know if this is using Meguro's samples or not
[3:20:06] <+cubbywolf> because the world is so great right now...
[3:20:11] <michlarv> So how does this compare to the first? Wanting to get through some other yakuzi's before I get on it.
[3:20:20] <%polothegreatest> I want to believe MrDestructoid
[3:20:20] <%megadblitz> "look i know ufos are fake but what if..."
[3:20:23] <medoodoo> Are U FO real?
[3:20:34] <+cubbywolf> skoot skoot
[3:20:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> turns out ijincho was built on top of a giant ufo the entire time
[3:20:59] <h0wiewong> RGG seems to be fairly consistent at the sequels being better
[3:21:00] <+Take_2_shots> Would you say it's worth missing out on the first one for this game so far?
[3:21:06] <%A_Zealous_Retort> what about dead souls?
[3:21:06] <michlarv> Oooh, good to hear. I have kiwami and the fist of the north star ones, only ever played Zero and loved it so much I put 100 hours into all the bullshit
[3:21:07] <%rbakervv> 6 was the first with it's new engine
[3:21:09] <+cubbywolf> should i skip 3 on my playthrough then?
[3:21:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Not that zombie one?
[3:21:16] <%KaiserMario> Pat, did you play Kiwami 2?
[3:21:16] <TheFramedWarlock> 3 is my favourite I will eat your babies
[3:21:17] <%shurtal> But Yamato II!
[3:21:20] <@Spydurman> TOO MANY ORPHANS
[3:21:23] <+BigCoffee> Hey pat now that you're in dya 3 of this. How do you feel about the intro to this game? Doesn't the first 3-4 hours feel kinda....weirdly written and tonal dissonant with the school infiltration?
[3:21:26] <akitanito> just watch an LP of it
[3:21:26] <devanmuse> so every third one? not looking forward to Yakuza 9
[3:21:27] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @cubbywolf no
[3:21:29] <teefpal> @OneThousandTomatoes I am also a huge fan of [game name blocked for spoilers]
[3:21:32] <h0wiewong> Got some good scenes though
[3:21:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> did the samurai game come out in the west yet?
[3:21:34] <+tetraes> didnt they make some samurai spinoff?
[3:21:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> PFFT
[3:21:38] <GiraffeInMyMouth> Would you want an Ishiin localization?
[3:21:44] <medoodoo> why?
[3:21:45] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is 6 worth playing?
[3:21:52] <Blank9> dead souls shit it's pants so binary domain could run
[3:21:56] <+BigCoffee> the 2 samurai games are so good its a crime we should get them one day
[3:22:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> the producer has said he wants to bring Ishin and Kenzan over SOON
[3:22:03] <michlarv> Pat did you play the fist of the north star one?
[3:22:03] <Blank9> oh yakuza ishin is possibly still the best in the series
[3:22:05] <%grimr2004> @PatStaresAt will this game make it to pc?
[3:22:05] <h0wiewong> Kenzan was made before 3, and apparently it holds up
[3:22:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> so im excited to see when
[3:22:11] <+BigCoffee> Kiryu is literally turned into 2 of the most iconic japanese heroes ever
[3:22:11] <jazzcuzzi> onomichi is so comfy
[3:22:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> MARK II
[3:22:21] <h0wiewong> Well it's Yakuza 2
[3:22:22] <akitanito> WHAT?
[3:22:23] <+BigCoffee> Yeah but you did play OG 2 right?
[3:22:29] <%notsoy> lmao wtf
[3:22:30] <teefpal> Every time I see the big-budget cutscenes for this game I am shocked the loc team was able to make the dialogue feel natural
[3:22:31] <%twistedj3ster> THAT'S THE BEST ONE
[3:22:31] <%KaiserMario> Kiwami 2 is 100% worth it
[3:22:33] <colzack_> Dead souls was actually the first game the director of Judgment worked on with the studio, so you could say we wouldnt have this without Dead Souls
[3:22:35] <%DianaTheAscian> its never to late
[3:22:39] <@Ranryu692> it's not too late; it would be a good game to stream during a lull between big releases
[3:22:41] <%Garthunox> Kiwami 2 fuckin rules!
[3:22:43] <Blank9> it's 2, but with 6's gameplay
[3:22:45] <%notsoy> there's a lot of 0/kiwami references/fanservice
[3:22:51] <+the_drummaestro> are all yakuza games worth it?
[3:22:53] <Blank9> and a lot missing/added
[3:23:00] <%notsoy> the cabaret club from 0 comes back, so if you liked that...
[3:23:01] <%chiazam> NO IT IS NOT, kiwami 2 is AWESOME
[3:23:02] <%bevyrage> dead souls also almost killed yakuza games coming to the west so that evens out @colzack_
[3:23:03] <+genepark> Maybe but Kiwami 2 is still so fun. It’s the best kiryu in dragon engine
[3:23:09] <medoodoo> this is the guy who played resident evil games bajillion times
[3:23:17] <teefpal> Dead Souls wasnt good, it's super rough
[3:23:17] <h0wiewong> Yeah that was a weird decision
[3:23:20] <loukemia83> Just like real life, Eat to get Stronger
[3:23:37] <stormhawk9891> Given how eating works in Yakuza, yeah that would be tedious
[3:23:38] <+genepark> Lol fair
[3:23:44] <%rekinom> a
[3:23:46] <@Ranryu692> yeah, that's kinda annoying, but once you do it it's fun to stomp everyone as full strength Kiryu
[3:23:48] <%chiazam> What? Is it!?
[3:23:50] <%polothegreatest> bottomless pit anf you are set
[3:23:52] <%notsoy> conversely, it's also tied to all the completion stuff, so playing minigames and shit also nets you XP
[3:24:11] <Blank9> original 2 still better, kiryu as a host is too good
[3:24:12] <+genepark> I 100%ed kiwami 2 anyway. It was surprisingly easy
[3:24:28] <medoodoo> what a nerd
[3:24:39] <TheFramedWarlock> What's your tierlist of the Yakuza games ?
[3:24:45] <mikeriffic> cus we are dumb monkeys they want nothing to do with
[3:24:50] <%notsoy> the only thing i haven't done to 100% is one of the minigames, which i just personally can't get myself up to the task for
[3:24:53] <michlarv> Pat you going back to fortnite at all? Cammy/Guile skins are in the store again <3
[3:24:58] <%DianaTheAscian> Theres a video about that
[3:25:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> this shit is wild. this is still the main story right?
[3:25:14] <+genepark> Yep got the god of war amulet or whatever it was called too
[3:25:32] <Blank9> 7, Judgement, 0, Ishin,  5, and 2 all highest tier
[3:25:34] <medoodoo> @PatStaresAt  do you believe in UFO/extra terrestrial ?
[3:25:34] <%chiazam> Amasawa is going to take your job and she deserves it @patstaresat
[3:25:41] <DonatelloJose> YABE
[3:25:47] <akitanito> oh that can be a problem
[3:25:49] <%topendbuzza> owhaaa
[3:26:06] <+PettyFunk> I liked Kiwami 2 overall, but I found the combat weird and slippery
[3:26:14] <@Ranryu692> you're not getting your money out of it if you've already bought it and you don't play it
[3:26:21] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:26:23] <%greasypete00> is it a drone
[3:26:25] <+genepark> Yakuza burnout is real
[3:26:25] <+tetraes> that is jank lol
[3:26:27] <draca23> Yeah, Yakuza games are really easy to get burnt out on.
[3:26:35] <%topendbuzza> is that not just someones drone
[3:26:36] <@Ranryu692> Greg's just using a flashlight onto a sheet on the clothesline
[3:26:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> beat up the alien children?
[3:26:48] <%GuilKato> if only they had a net to throw on teh drone
[3:26:48] <%Piemono> FIGHT THE ALIENS
[3:26:55] <EternalJedi> smol

[3:28:02] <medoodoo> wild guess - his dad is controlling that UFO
[3:28:17] <teefpal> Imagine if this unlocked a Mass Effect style minigame
[3:28:19] <+cubbywolf> aliens are unphotographable with their superior alien technology
[3:28:31] <+genepark> This game lets you fight the children before you help the children. THAT’S tonal balance
[3:28:43] <MayShip> did they make tailing people in this game less boring or shorter
[3:28:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> knock is down with a baseball

[3:30:28] <+tetraes> i thought this was a crime drama game or???
[3:30:34] <Diabetic> this actually looks really fun
[3:30:36] <+cubbywolf> chase mechanic LUL
[3:30:38] <%Deekman> This side story rules

[3:30:47] <+BigCoffee> @tetraes it is but never in the main story

[4:00:17] <%castlerock42> Is Yagami even getting officially paid for this?
[4:00:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt one of those clubs is probably the VR club and you do Dice and Cube for them
[4:00:18] <+teh_rawk> is yagami better than haruka at dancing?
[4:00:19] <+supersonic21> its a little less deep then say taxi racing or hunting, but they all still have their own storys and are fun as hell
[4:00:21] <Tracazoid> Yakuza 8: "We still didn't put rollback in Virtua Fighter."
[4:00:22] <ianabstract> Yakuza is a series that proves that you can do really incredible things if you just never throw anything out and keep adding to it
[4:00:30] <h0wiewong> He's a quick learner
[4:00:31] <%DashXero> He's a liar, Pat.
[4:00:37] <%Daxalog> Isnt this a real song?
[4:00:37] <%notsoy> it's like how kiryu didn't know how to manage a real estate company
[4:00:39] <+supersonic21> yagami is experance "cloud in a dress" syndrome
[4:00:41] <DusK_The_Stray> No, that's kung fu
[4:00:44] <%arcadianskypirate> He learned a very special form of kung fu
[4:00:50] <%Deft_Thought> Don't be absurd. Those are simply Kung Fu katas.
[4:00:50] <GManx0> It is all in his head
[4:00:50] <@Ranryu692> I prefer the karaoke
[4:00:58] <tanarath> he's just adapting kung fu
[4:01:00] <DusK_The_Stray> You can't do Kung Fu either
[4:01:00] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:01] <%A_Zealous_Retort> which yakuza will have Ichiban become a Vtuber?
[4:01:02] <Brandon__Brando> ya you can try them right now
[4:01:06] <+Indigo_909> You totally should try to impress the WIFE
[4:01:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's already fit and coordinated, helps a lot I guess
[4:01:18] <h0wiewong> Never ever stop listening to So Much More
[4:01:19] <Blank9> KOOOONAN
[4:01:19] <+supersonic21> im suprised they didnt do kareoke in this. they had greg chun sing bakimitai in 7
[4:01:29] <+Fefe41> Excuse me Haruka's title song was rad
[4:01:30] <akitanito> konan was great though
[4:01:35] <%cooldude69xx> "Dancing? What's-" *Does a kickflip to the beat* "that? Is it a food?"
[4:01:43] <+teh_rawk> sonn yagami will have to open the yagami anything agency
[4:01:45] <+Fefe41> KONNAN JA NAI
[4:01:47] <+ArmoredDeath> hotashiGfm
[4:01:49] <%stubborndeer> Neat!
[4:01:50] <GamerWorlock> This sounds llke street fighter 4
[4:01:59] <Blank9> you should see how many minigames are in Ishin, it's even more absurd
[4:01:59] <%Axellogic> You dropped an entire freestyle though
[4:02:03] <%polothegreatest> FC OhMyDog
[4:02:03] <+Indigo_909> Now MvC
[4:02:06] <itsjamesalex> when are we getting the twerk freestyle
[4:02:11] <akitanito> The stat increase is tiny
[4:02:20] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> total global saturation
[4:02:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> not even SSS+
[4:02:42] <%shootbang_exe> yagami coming off like a sex pervert rn
[4:02:44] <Aoworth> Lost Judgement Other Baby
[4:02:54] <%stubborndeer> Pat that means "Stupid bitch" in JApanese
[4:03:08] <%Felhad> She is the Sugar Baby
[4:03:10] <+ofblueair> Do you want to be my sugar baby?
[4:03:14] <%Felhad> go to Regionals
[4:03:14] <SaltyAzteca> THE LONG HAUL
[4:03:22] <h0wiewong> This is a lot of effort to ask a question
[4:03:23] <akitanito> can't s-link until they go to the nationals
[4:03:24] <%ape_hawk> did pat kill any kids yet?
[4:03:28] <%demiiluna> IT'S ON TO SECTIONALS BABY
[4:03:29] <colzack_> We going to regionals
[4:03:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> we're gonna have to go to nationals before I learn anything about the case
[4:03:31] <SomeAsianDood> and then it's on to semi regionals and then regional semis
[4:03:32] <%stubborndeer> You need to unlock more moves
[4:03:32] <%cvp5127> AND THE PROMS TOMORROW
[4:03:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> We out here. Crying in the Club
[4:03:36] <h0wiewong> Take this team all the way, then you can ask about the sugar baby
[4:03:38] <teefpal> How old is Yagami?
[4:03:44] <cervidaequus> LETS GOOOO DANCE CHAMPIONSHIPS
[4:03:44] <Aoworth> You're gonna have to take them through fucking nationals before you'll find out about the sugar baby I'll bet
[4:03:46] <+PettyFunk> The menu music gives me Fall Guys vibes
[4:03:46] <%shurtal> Can you fill out this sugar baby survey : [[hyperlink blocked]]
[4:03:47] <+RealmRifter> Use Surrender EX on her Kappa
[4:03:50] <h0wiewong> He's like early 40s
[4:03:52] <Saltmeisterr> SHOW HIM TO THE DOG
[4:03:53] <%MechArch> this is just dumb anime bullshit
[4:04:04] <teefpal> @h0wiewong :\
[4:04:06] <+Indigo_909> @Saltmeisterr what the dog doin?
[4:04:07] <+PettyFunk> hE'S 35 IN jUDGMENT, 38 IN THIS.
[4:04:11] <%kyh9> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND COMMISSIONER, WE NEED TO BEAT SUZAKU HIGH IN THE DANCE COMPETITION TO SOLVE THE MURDERS
[4:04:11] <+PettyFunk> Oops caps lock sorry
[4:04:11] <%stubborndeer> Pat you can take these people to cool places like mcdonalds
[4:04:14] <GManx0> Is the Main story also a side quest
[4:04:14] <%stubborndeer> also fire pizza
[4:04:15] <DXLelouch24> you have to be a BIG SHOT to get the Sugar Baby
[4:04:19] <%stubborndeer> or whatever the translation is
[4:04:20] <blastazoid00> Huh, they all have different effects
[4:04:25] <h0wiewong> Well close to 40
[4:04:29] <RaidenRising> B I G S H O T
[4:04:30] <%DashXero> Man... He looks rough for almost 40...
[4:04:35] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr screaming at yagami dancing
[4:04:44] <%Axellogic> when does new song
[4:04:49] <+ofblueair> alright gang... time to dance!
[4:04:53] <+BigCoffee> @DashXero the actor is over 40
[4:04:54] <teefpal> COME ON YAGAMI, DONT BE THE [[Little Sponge]]
[4:04:55] <+PettyFunk> He is definitely following suit with Yakuza protags in how INTO IT he is LUL
[4:05:00] <%stubborndeer> You can also change their clothing during performances and unlock lots of it from clubs
[4:05:01] <+BigCoffee> but the character is meant to be 35
[4:05:02] <h0wiewong> Hard does not mess around
[4:05:06] <willyfreshness> big ups to the mocap crew
[4:05:11] <%DashXero> @BigCoffee Ah. That explains it.
[4:05:18] <%RaziWraith> Does not like to dance btw.
[4:05:18] <Zombrocom> All yakuza protags most be super into whatever they do
[4:05:22] <Aoworth> Just press the buttons on time 4Head
[4:05:42] <%Deft_Thought> I guess it makes sense to include a minigame like this with the lead actor being a former boyband member
[4:05:45] <Aoworth> RESET
[4:05:45] <+PettyFunk> Yakuza protags take NO half measures
[4:05:48] <h0wiewong> The rhythm game curse
[4:05:50] <DefaultSettiings> WHY IS HE SO GOOD AT THIS
[4:05:52] <%MugenSandan> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:05:55] <%demiiluna> NOW YOU'LL NEVER GET TO REGIONALS
[4:05:56] <%DianaTheAscian> RESET
[4:05:57] <%RealThiele> HEALERS ADJUST
[4:05:59] <%stubborndeer> This game is cool
[4:06:01] <%MechArch> you'll never get to the fianls
[4:06:04] <DusK_The_Stray> No Full Combo
[4:06:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This game LUL
[4:06:10] <%shootbang_exe> PRELIMS TIME
[4:06:13] <+BigCoffee> @DashXero its proof that everyone in RGG should always make only the main character a new creation and not someone
[4:06:21] <Zombrocom> 2 misses? Pathetic. Do it over.
[4:06:23] <Aoworth> Suzaku High got the full combo
[4:06:24] <%chiazam> Denial
[4:06:26] <%stubborndeer> Do it like ten times in a row if you want them to think you are serious pat
[4:06:35] <%DashXero> @BigCoffee Yeah. i can agree with that.
[4:06:38] <%kyh9> WE’RE GOING TO REGIONALS
[4:06:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> its noce that the arrows point in the direction of the position of the button
[4:06:44] <willyfreshness> god its even jazzier persona music

[4:07:05] <%bevyrage> pat you're gonna need to make them INTERNATIONAL SENSATIONS before you can pinpoint which one is the sugar baby
[4:07:05] <%DianaTheAscian> Hopefully this game doesn't acknowledge full combos
[4:07:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> the BIGGEST one
[4:07:10] <DusK_The_Stray> She's gonna die before you get to fucking Nationals lmao

[4:07:49] <teefpal> "Yagami what are you doing with these kids? What about the investigation?"
[4:07:50] <h0wiewong> @vaderxyz1970 Yagami at dodgeball would be a menace
[4:07:56] <Zombrocom> YOU GOT THIS
[4:08:01] <%shootbang_exe> this subquest is the plot of a very cheap movie
[4:08:01] <Aoworth> The (Sugar) Baby
[4:08:05] <willyfreshness> ITS TO SOLVE CRIMES
[4:08:08] <%Booda_Kai> go to bed, Paige
[4:08:10] <+PettyFunk> Did Paige play Persona? LUL
[4:08:22] <SomeAsianDood> SERIOUS. CRIME. DRAMA.
[4:08:24] <%megadblitz> paige is the baby and she need some sugar
[4:08:36] <%chiazam> THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE GET TO PLAY WITH THE THIRD YEARS GUYS
[4:08:36] <%UvBenServed> The real sugar baby was the friends we made along the way
[4:08:36] <%Daxalog> Please tell me theirs gonna be a rival dance group that steals their routine and then they have to improvise more Kung Fu.
[4:08:39] <Zombrocom> CRIIIIIIME
[4:08:50] <+BigCoffee> THAT WAS THE BEST SIDEQUEST
[4:08:50] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> they should replace the main menu screen with a lets dance image until you win nationals
[4:08:52] <h0wiewong> Remember when we discovered a 2 month rotting corpse?
[4:08:52] <+BigCoffee> EVER
[4:08:59] <%ape_hawk> that shit can happen, tho
[4:09:05] <+vaderxyz1970> @h0wiewong I just want them to Dodgeball a
[4:09:07] <Aoworth> Was that quest plot-critical though?
[4:09:10] <Saltmeisterr> THE GIANT ROOMBA PAT
[4:09:11] <+vaderxyz1970> the movie
[4:09:12] <DiksieNormis> wubbyForklift wubbyForklift wubbyForklift wubbyForklift wubbyForklift
[4:09:12] <%Bt_Robot> Fighting a giant roomba
[4:09:15] <Saltmeisterr> DON'T FORGET THAT
[4:09:15] <camelwizard> The sidequests are the absolute best part of the series
[4:09:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Yakuza 8 will be a twitch streamer
[4:09:15] <@ssjklyco> You also fought a giant ROOMBA
[4:09:15] <%shootbang_exe> this is honestly a comedy movie premise
[4:09:20] <%DianaTheAscian> 7 got pretty crazy
[4:09:22] <+PettyFunk> Most of the first Judgment's sidequests were a LITTLE less extreme than mainline Yakuza stuff, but even then there were a few wacky ones.
[4:09:30] <%castlerock42> Pat, 7 had the protagonist literally devoted to the core game mechanic throughout the story.
[4:09:33] <%Bt_Robot> Dr. Wily missions in Yakuza 7
[4:09:52] <@Ranryu692> FFXIV is awesome. I went to Ishgard and there's an orchestra of 8 Lalafell performing "Still Alive" from Portal for a crowd
[4:10:05] <h0wiewong> What, solving a murder? Nah it's time for regionals
[4:10:08] <%shootbang_exe> YEAH
[4:10:12] <%ThomasOfTroy> YES
[4:10:13] <Aoworth> YEEEEAAAAHH
[4:10:14] <willyfreshness> YEAHHHH
[4:10:14] <camelwizard> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:10:17] <RaidenRising> ye
[4:10:20] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA
[4:10:20] <medoodoo> go where?
[4:10:21] <+ofblueair> HELL YEAH
[4:10:24] <%shootbang_exe> WHO CARES ABOUT THAT CHUMP WHO DIED IT'S TIME FOR DANCING
[4:10:24] <%DianaTheAscian> YEYEYEYEYE

[4:10:25] <studleydoorite> DANCE MEAT YEAH

[4:10:30] <EternalJedi> limesDance YEAHHHHHHHH
[4:10:35] <%Bt_Robot> But are they even ready?
[4:10:39] <%fat_burtreynolds> MEAT DANCE
[4:10:47] <h0wiewong> And probably make them the best at what they do
[4:10:48] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> dance crimes!
[4:10:52] <%DianaTheAscian> okay wheres the rival group?
[4:10:57] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt The marketboard in 14 is so volatile but I need enough money for 6.1.
[4:10:58] <+vaderxyz1970> This game is 21 jumpstreet
[4:10:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> well there's already two mystery clubs right?
[4:11:04] <GManx0> Make all the clubs fight each other
[4:11:04] <%grimr2004> how much is this game btw
[4:11:06] <%amaranthos> Infiltrate the CHILD CRIME CLUB
[4:11:10] <@ssjklyco> One's gonna be the RPG club I bet
[4:11:10] <%grimr2004> The content is crazy
[4:11:20] <%amaranthos> Really though I'm almost guaranteeing a kendo club
[4:11:21] <%RaziWraith> RaziWraith subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! If you don't have a dance battle with the sugar mommy, this isn't a true Yakuza side quest.
[4:11:24] <%chiazam> Tell Her about THE PROFESSOR
[4:11:24] <+thefakeh> sploosh
[4:11:38] <cervidaequus> Do we get rival Clovers team?
[4:11:41] <%Piemono> Yea
