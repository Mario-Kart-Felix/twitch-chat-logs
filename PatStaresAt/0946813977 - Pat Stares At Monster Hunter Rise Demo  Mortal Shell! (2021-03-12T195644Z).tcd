[0:02:27] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I absolutely love that Pat's model here is a literal cube man
[0:02:29] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Cancelled my pre-order playing this demo again, ngl. Just not feeling it. Maybe when PC ver comes. scottfDying
[0:02:31] <GUDDAY12> its kicking everyones asses
[0:02:36] <%KishinGrek> started playing Days Gone this week, it's the most "Okay" game I've ever played
[0:02:44] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Ready to get my jank jonk on.
[0:02:47] <%LonePlus_> really dont wanna play this with joycons
[0:03:02] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaBig psaSmug
[0:03:11] <%DianaTheAscian> then just get a pro controller?
[0:03:15] <$og_reesetti> Gonna be real, the time limit is what kills it for me. and since that's not in the main game then it should be fine but fuck trying to solo this thing right now
[0:03:23] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @LonePlus_ does the game not have pro controller support
[0:03:33] <DaKnightWarrior> Magnamalo is super fun!
[0:03:48] <%LonePlus_> i dont have a pro controller lmao
[0:03:48] <%DianaTheAscian> whats the time limit?
[0:03:50] <%Mrbaconator> more like magnamarshmallow
[0:03:55] <$og_reesetti> The series has been downhill since we couldn't use the Wiimote and Joycon anymore
[0:03:58] <TreeLeafBoi> 15 minutes
[0:03:59] <%Mrbaconator> 15 minutes

I’m playing through Yakuzy starting with 0 thanks to your LAD play though.  Take that, stream hating executives
[0:04:02] <%Mrbaconator> for magnamalow
[0:04:06] <GoldenGod0> Can't wait to se pat get combo'd by the big fart cat
[0:04:07] <%PanicSwytch> Got the first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday and I feel like shit

[0:04:11] <%DianaTheAscian> k
[0:04:12] <TreeLeafBoi> you have to play damn near perfect
[0:04:16] <mybigmeech> I feel like you have to go "full" tryhard and hope rathian shows up so you can span the tail flip
[0:04:20] <%JoshManVGH> @loneplus_ Do you play docked or handheld more often?
[0:04:30] <mybigmeech> *spam*
[0:04:33] <%LonePlus_> docked
[0:04:35] <$og_reesetti> The fight itself is great, like Zinogre and Brachy rolled into one, but fuck that time
[0:04:45] <%Necnill> any gamers in chat
[0:05:00] <%Blackmage9999> hoi
[0:05:06] <%JoshManVGH> No gamers here, only literary fans.
[0:05:06] <+Dayube> @loneplus_ then just get a pro controller man
[0:05:09] <%DianaTheAscian> I was gonna say every demo flagship is hard but then I remember that Gora Magala was a joke
[0:05:32] <+Double_Tap_That> Anyone else getting an occasional audio pop or is that just me?
[0:05:34] <+jofrankii> did pat start MH yet?
[0:05:41] <%PanicSwytch> RELOAD
[0:05:44] <DrkJP520> I spent all my demo tries today without beating it D,:
[0:05:45] <DianaTheAscian> no
[0:05:51] <blackbookalpha> ye ye ye time for purple boi
[0:05:58] <+Double_Tap_That> @jofrankii Considering there hasn't been an hour of not playing the game yet, no.
[0:05:59] <$og_reesetti> It's been long enough I can't remember if Tri demo had a challenge, or Gen/Genu
[0:06:00] <DaKnightWarrior> His moves are really punishable but his hitzones could be better.
[0:06:01] <+jofrankii> cool made it in time
[0:06:10] <DaKnightWarrior> that darn time though.
[0:06:23] <%JoshManVGH> @dayube seconded. it's a worthwhile quality of life investment. For handheld I was gonna suggest the Hori third party full sized grips.
[0:06:30] <$og_reesetti> World however, made it a point to kick your shit in with Nergi and Velk
[0:06:39] <%DianaTheAscian> its a shame that amibo in the collectors addition is kinda lame

[0:07:06] <%JoshManVGH> Sorry it's the Hori Split Pad Pro
[0:07:27] <DrkJP520> 15 minutes is ridiculous. I was in a group and it felt like we were consistently pummeling him. Traps etc the whole shebang. Wouldn't go down
[0:07:33] <Blank9> I'm loving almost every weapon so far
[0:07:41] <+SocialMisfitGamer> TIME TO HUNT SOME MONSTERS!
[0:07:43] <JoshManVGH> no vibration or Amiibo support, but a worthwhile sacrifice.
[0:07:47] <DaKnightWarrior> Let's go!
[0:07:53] <$og_reesetti> The bitch is also apparently scaled up
[0:08:00] <%kullumanati> Yeah no boring building game.
[0:08:04] <%JoshManVGH> YEEEEEEEES! Monster bash!
[0:08:07] <+SocialMisfitGamer> forgive me for being uncultured, but who is that with Nemesis?
[0:08:12] <%PanicSwytch> Kiryu Never Killed Anyone

[0:16:53] <%BoxNavy> did i miss anything cool
[0:16:58] <%blaggablag> Plus meeting lagiacrus underwater was such an iconic moment in that game. That monster design shone in it's environment and then acted like a confused pug whenever it got out
[0:17:01] <Coystick> THE MALEZ
[0:17:01] <Ipsenscastle> just take the top off and look at the label Pat, do it, expose orb
[0:17:03] <%BoxNavy> did i miss a cool pat moment?

[0:17:17] <%Who_lio42> @PatStaresAt EternalRival
[0:17:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> was that the one where you guys were fashonistas
[0:17:20] <+BettyMwwaahh> I'd say Alatreon is the best fight. Mastering that feels really good
[0:17:21] <%sumrand0> I'm all for more long monsters: gives more more targets to make the Pierce ammo go Brrrrrrrr
[0:17:32] <Zeif00> The MHxUniqlo shirts have always been very good
[0:17:38] <%TamsynRRD> @goldengod0 Congalala
[0:17:51] <%Crookedspiral> so who's seen the Monster Hunter movie?
[0:17:51] <Firemahci> Alatreon is top 5
[0:17:54] <%blaggablag> @GoldenGod0 It had the best maps too.

[0:19:00] <+BettyMwwaahh> i JUST bought a Hitbox case from Eternal Rival
[0:19:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @PatStaresAt since ArcSys wants to put rollback in there old games, wouldn't it be sick it they not only give Persona 4 Arena Ultimax a PC port but also  give that game rollback?
[0:19:23] <%sumrand0> Alatreon was fun and a good challenge at first but after you got the pattern down it was a bit of a novelty fight. half the difficulty came from not being able to change gear or resupply at all unless you faint
[0:19:27] <cholongkh> boobs

[0:25:09] <%TrafficCohen> Try harder
[0:25:17] <Hydrapissed> was only good at brood war and woof my hands fell off
[0:25:18] <@commanderclaw> The multitasking in RTS games fucking kills me
[0:25:19] <rosencruez> try harder
[0:25:22] <+LowBatteryLife> Starcraft is the most stressful game on the planet. Can't do it.
[0:25:26] <%hotcarl6872> good luck, Magnamalo hits like a truck
[0:25:26] <Psyramics> same
[0:25:32] <+enternius> Everytime I play an RTS I just want to build, I don't want to fight
[0:25:40] <%barrakuta371> That's such a shame cause Homeworld is awesome
[0:25:40] <%grimmsean> grimmsean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! my sub has entered its teens, time to not understand Pat's references to things in the 1900's
[0:25:40] <%AncelDeLambert> ditto
[0:25:42] <$RealThiele> you goblin a base and forget its a game
[0:25:43] <%TrafficCohen> I cheesed my way through Red alert 1 2 and 3 with guides on Easy
[0:25:43] <%sumrand0> So happy CB unga bunga still works
[0:25:44] <Tracazoid> Likewise
[0:25:44] <+Ancopro> i just wanna build a pretty base
[0:25:45] <$KaosMachina> I mean half the shit he does is blame himself and apologize for everything so he's canadian
[0:25:47] <Zebroneath> I cannot keep track of all the processes that go in RTSs
[0:25:49] <+D00msDayDan> cnc3 is the shit
[0:25:52] <kylealdrete> but did you have fun at it?
[0:25:53] <%hotcarl6872> but you can block most attacks even with the GS
[0:25:56] <%MoguManda> MoguManda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! <3
[0:25:58] <Link232> Need a multithreaded brain to play RTS and man I am single core as fuck
[0:25:58] <+RandyFistburgers> oh yeah I can't play that online to save my life
[0:26:00] <kylealdrete> being bad doesnt mean you arent having fun. thats the important thing
[0:26:06] <+GrooovinMagic> Did you complete the Starcraft campaign?
[0:26:07] <Psyramics> i get so stressed it hurts for my heart to beat
[0:26:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> You guys never talk about fighting games
[0:26:11] <%AncelDeLambert> C&C Generals is my favorite RTS, because I love building just twenty choppers and doing a mass missile storm, I don't give a FUCK about micro
[0:26:13] <Wraithakiin> did a new demo go up or has he just gone back to the original one
[0:26:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Woolie likes fighting games?
[0:26:25] <$RealThiele> fighting wha?
[0:26:26] <+D00msDayDan> the trick to liking RTS is to play exclusively comp stomp and be bitter that the focus on esports basically killed the genre off
[0:26:28] <%BoxNavy> :(
[0:26:30] <+MillerLowlife> could do a low elo legends crossover episode with t90 lol
[0:26:34] <Hydrapissed> yah 2 bad they are gone now lol
[0:26:34] <$KaosMachina> replace starcraft with Warcraft 3 and smae here
[0:26:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> RTS is stupid

[0:38:48] <+zalonar> Omega
[0:38:48] <+OmegaWeltall> yea and Nidhogg would jsut talk shit the whole time LUL
[0:38:50] <LoreKeeper_Thal> they could literally just use Kushala's skeleton

[0:38:56] <%CalderGaming> how would you explain nidhogg showing up tho
[0:38:56] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Nidhogg DLC?
[0:38:58] <2Bs_USB_port> fuckin bahamut

[0:39:07] <Hydrapissed> would fit
[0:39:08] <imabooterfly> Eden Ramuh
[0:39:09] <Vaunno> replace all melynx on the field with tonberry

[0:39:13] <+BettyMwwaahh> Alatreon/Fatalis kinda fight
[0:39:14] <PyroDrag> Ixion would be funny
[0:39:16] <dan_g_v> imagine a chocobo amd moogle combo, and the rumors think it's a new kind of Kirin or something like that
[0:39:16] <$RealThiele> shoot an rpg at it LUL
[0:39:18] <%BoxNavy> mh players would die to the stack up attack

[0:39:24] <%Who_lio42> LEVIATHAN LEVIATHAN
[0:39:26] <dan_g_v> and then a fat chocobo falls in during the fight
[0:39:27] <+khazdee> as long as we dont have to fight shiva again im fine with that
[0:39:35] <%spitelite> estinien shows up for some reason
[0:39:37] <xeros720> Ixion would be just a giant kirin, which means they might do that
[0:39:41] <Hydrapissed> 👏
[0:39:44] <%Alazull> Either Nidhogg or maybe go a little weird and do Alexander?
[0:39:45] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEES
[0:39:51] <Hydrapissed> pat should wants part breaker to be good
[0:39:52] <%RD_nx> Pat in the Goss Harag gamplay trailer at the beginning there is talk about customizing your movement for a different playstyle
[0:39:52] <ScreamLord> Tonberry
[0:39:53] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> and then you tell Nidhogg that his sister was a casual
[0:39:55] <Hydrapissed> just*
[0:40:01] <+MassConnect> cactuar
[0:40:02] <%keye90> Ixion as a Kirin seems very plausible
[0:40:03] <xeros720> Estinian would give you the quest and let you know about the free trial
[0:40:03] <%RD_nx> *moveset
[0:40:03] <+SocialMisfitGamer> And then when you kill him for his parts you can make V's cane
[0:40:06] <+BettyMwwaahh> Tonberry lmao
[0:40:09] <xeros720> now including heavensward
[0:40:14] <kylealdrete> is the final boss just a human? cuz humans are the real monsters?
[0:40:18] <%SharkMissile> King Moggle Mog, Twelfth of his name, may his pom p be forever soft

[0:41:52] <CatRidder> none likes water
[0:41:52] <$velgaduere> ZOUNDS
[0:41:52] <ScreamLord> I think if they gave it another go they could make underwater combat work, and work well
[0:41:54] <%grimmsean> i missed a month
[0:41:54] <%TrafficCohen> In ninteen dickety 3
[0:41:55] <Blank9> there's a good chance of zamtrios coming back

[0:42:11] <xeros720> the world needs a 4k 60 fps zamtrios
[0:42:12] <Jaysky> Zamtrios was my favorite monster to hunt

[0:43:16] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Clifford is a kaiju
[0:43:19] <xeros720> you get to find out the truth of dealing with Clifford's everything
[0:43:20] <+SikNoscz> @huskarl_zap Prussia basically founded Germany, it wasn't a seperate country, Germany didnt exist yet
[0:43:20] <%cache_22> I just remembered they are making a Clifford the Big Red Dog movie.

[0:43:25] <Pookiedaexzile> YOu mean the giant Murder Dog covered in the blood of his enemies
[0:43:29] <%Daxalog> Its a metaphor for growing responsibility as you age!
[0:43:30] <%dekkitout> HE GREW FROM LOVE
[0:43:31] <ExpressNode> I use to red those books all the time
[0:43:31] <echobee_tv> Clifford is a nightmare
[0:43:32] <Jaysky> And?
[0:43:32] <Hydrapissed> hes bigger than a house
[0:43:34] <%patriotrenegade> Zangief would absolutely eat you given the chance.
[0:43:34] <%ThirdWelles> CLIFFORD IS A MONSTER
[0:43:35] <%LonePlus_> a real ass clifford would be terrifying
[0:43:37] <%WhereIsWill> he's the size of a building
[0:43:37] <%Nested_Dreams> Anatomically correcr infinite growth tho
[0:43:37] <%dekkitout> That's scary as shit
[0:43:38] <Vaunno> Dog colossi are cursed
[0:43:38] <OldManDeckardCain> clifford is adorable, just like godzilla LUL
[0:43:40] <%grimmsean> Lets hope Clifford is clipped
[0:43:41] <%Rabbidbunnyz> but he
[0:43:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Smallest Kaiju
[0:43:42] <Psyramics> clifford is terrifying if you take it out of the children's bookcontext
[0:43:42] <$RealThiele> his shits would be epic
[0:43:43] <%blaggablag> Clifford ain't scary until you have to pick up a shit
[0:43:43] <%Rabbidbunnyz> 's good!
[0:43:44] <+BettyMwwaahh> hes a golden retriever or something. not scary
[0:43:44] <SkittlesOfAstora> what is a clifford
[0:43:44] <+SocialMisfitGamer> He's not THAT big tho
[0:43:45] <%templar010> hes literally a kaiju
[0:43:46] <The_500lb_Child> Godzilla Vs Kong Vs Clifford
[0:43:46] <Jaysky> A kaiju you can CONTROL
[0:43:46] <%AkronymCLT> if that happened people would start to call him Junji Eato
[0:43:46] <Tooniearcade> OWL2019punch OWL2019punch OWL2019punch OWL2019punch
[0:43:47] <+MooseIsGoose> He steals love and grows
[0:43:47] <%ThirdWelles> holy shit
[0:43:48] <%weissguard> A  Kaiju of LOVE
[0:43:51] <kylealdrete> they literally made a horror movie about a big scary dog! its called kujo
[0:43:51] <%ThirdWelles> Cursed knowledge
[0:43:55] <%cvp5127> his dumps must be scary
[0:43:56] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> his food bill would be terrifying
[0:43:56] <%Valdorick> If you have home insurance, Clifford being your neighbor's dog is scary.
[0:43:57] <Vaunno> he IS that big
[0:43:59] <$velgaduere> a real Clifford would eat people
[0:44:01] <bob900000> he's not that big
[0:44:03] <%spitelite> how much dog nut would clifford make
[0:44:11] <anAngryHamster> Eldritch Marmaduke
[0:44:13] <%Ynkubus_> The creautre form the korean Host movie is smaller than Clifford
[0:44:17] <$RealThiele> at least a gallon of nutt
[0:44:19] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah I remember that live-action Clifford trailer. That was atrocious
[0:44:22] <+LastHazzerd> i want stamina in darksouls
[0:44:27] <%WhereIsWill> who cut clifford's psaBig nuts?!? you MUST answer
[0:44:28] <ThirdWelles> Stamina should stay in for Elden ring.
[0:44:31] <dizimous> I mean the no stamina thing is a deliberate choice for Sekiro, stamina works v well im DS
[0:44:32] <%ThirdWelles> For sure
[0:44:37] <Hydrapissed> or 55 guys with guns
[0:44:38] <%Who_lio42> an amount id rather not think about
[0:44:44] <Blank9> he'd get past the infamous rubble pile
[0:44:47] <+BettyMwwaahh> just dont add a grapple point?
[0:44:51] <Blank9> no lord souls needed
[0:44:57] <%shurtal> Why can't Sekiro crouch
[0:44:57] <Coystick> Sekiro needed more stealth
[0:44:59] <%dekkitout> Literal peaks and valleys
[0:45:00] <%ThirdWelles> Like the speed of Sekiro DOES NOT fit medieval/Viking tone
[0:45:11] <xeros720> you were on top of a tower or in a cave the whole game
[0:45:13] <SkittlesOfAstora> They should make a good Tenchu game
[0:45:14] <CatRidder> the upgrade tree from sekiro should never comeback
[0:45:17] <%bevyrage> yeah sekiro has a lot of instances where you have to jump to reach grapple range
[0:45:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Part of the Challenge is not knowing what you grapple on
[0:45:19] <+thotbane> Elden Ring's gonna be based
[0:45:22] <+MugenSandan> Sekiro can crouch
[0:45:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Maaaaagggic
[0:45:24] <%Rabbidbunnyz> souls+ stealth
[0:45:25] <+TopTieramisu> horse stamina
[0:45:25] <%BoxNavy> good
[0:45:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah
[0:45:30] <Will_The_Soulless> Did you watch that leak right
[0:45:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Eldest Souls
[0:45:34] <+DukeBlack_> just make shit break
[0:45:35] <%Rabbidbunnyz> no way
[0:45:36] <$RealThiele> Elden ring Dark souls horsey
[0:45:36] <%ThirdWelles> really?
[0:45:37] <samazam94> i just want the weapons to clang with each other
[0:45:37] <Pookiedaexzile> lol
[0:45:38] <+BettyMwwaahh> not having stamina is great but stamina is Very souls like
[0:45:41] <%datKado> just add boss finishers, those were cool
[0:45:42] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yea, between Nioh and my love for Tenchu, Sekiro was a big letdown for me personally
[0:45:43] <Coystick> There are unused sneaking animations in DaS3 that are in the Elden leaks
[0:45:43] <dizimous> Tbf, they set it in a fucking gorgeous mountainess region where there would be a fuck ton of cliffs, tho I see your point
[0:45:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Eh
[0:45:50] <CatRidder> rally from bloodborne
[0:45:50] <+Ultimate_Edge> The leak had crouch stealth, their has got to be stamina
[0:45:51] <%ThirdWelles> How does it fit into the souls structure without stamina?
[0:45:59] <%ThirdWelles> If you can just block forever then what?
[0:46:00] <%BoxNavy> no one will do that
[0:46:04] <Pookiedaexzile> That might literally effect sales negatively
[0:46:07] <$RealThiele> Sekiro combat felt like ping ping ping ping execute
[0:46:07] <%Lion_kun> At least not during travel.
[0:46:12] <Pookiedaexzile> but IGn is gonna love it
[0:46:21] <%Arancet> john*
[0:46:23] <%Tearonex> John
[0:46:25] <%Deekman> Marcus Fenix
[0:46:27] <%thotbane> John DiMaggio

[0:47:41] <Vendigear> oh boy, we're gonna see Pat get stomped by Magna

[0:47:46] <$RealThiele> Paaaaaatuhhhhh
[0:47:51] <%asgard147> Bet he just wants to eat snow psaDogchamp
[0:47:52] <leto_ii_muadibadder> Jebaited
[0:48:02] <Vendigear> lemme tell you, Magna in this demo is not designed to be beaten by mortal men
[0:48:04] <%ThirdWelles> @dizimous :cringe:
[0:48:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dang nabbit the moment I get in pat vanishes
[0:48:32] <dizimous> @thirdwelles 😃
[0:48:46] <DarkPlague20> what is the song during the brb animation?
[0:48:54] <$RealThiele> i think theres more frames of animation in Elmos dance since i last saw the brb
[0:49:00] <%Rabbidbunnyz> literally at the bottom right lmao
[0:49:01] <%ThirdWelles> @DarkPlague20 Jank Jonk by Fingers
[0:49:03] <Jaysky> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Try leaving and coming back and see if that fixes his disappearance
[0:49:05] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:49:13] <xeros720> sounds like the freaking nergigante in the demo where you had 10 or so minutes
[0:49:22] <%soulphantom44> soulphantom44 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! hey pat keep it up and congrats on the marriage proposal
[0:49:23] <+traximus_s> it's in the bottom right corner
[0:49:24] <randominternetsurfer> @chat how many times did Magnamalo kick Pat's ass so far?
[0:49:32] <ToneBacas> this music reminds me of Yakuza 0
[0:49:32] <Vaunno> none
[0:49:41] <%ThirdWelles> He hasn't started lol
[0:49:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Jaysky I see, makes sense
[0:49:52] <%ThirdWelles> Pre-roll, baby
[0:49:57] <Vendigear> you have 15 minutes
[0:49:59] <Vaunno> literally zero times LUL
[0:50:00] <Jaysky> I kinda wish there were more results for the Pat & Paige dance part cause it cuts to it so often
[0:50:01] <$RealThiele> starting? at 49 minutes? hahahaha
[0:50:05] <ace_sabo_luffy__> If he wasnt trying so hard it wouldnt be funny LUL
[0:50:08] <%patriotrenegade> Is that a Metallica riff inthere
[0:50:10] <ToneBacas> no game yet, just thanking the pipo and engaging with the chat
[0:50:17] <Oxybe> Watched Max play the demo all last night. Magmamarshmellow does not play nice
[0:50:26] <Jaysky> @RealThiele That's small talk, try starting at 2 hours in
[0:50:26] <Vendigear> and when the top MH speedrunners are getting 11 minute runs, you know this demo is scuffed
[0:50:35] <%patriotrenegade> It’s just the time limit that makes it hard.
[0:50:36] <Vaunno> magma-ball-o is no joke
[0:50:37] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:50:50] <%BoxNavy> literally took 30 minutes wym
[0:50:53] <$velgaduere> if your preshow isn't at least 2 hours long can you even call yourself a streamer
[0:50:56] <PinoProxie> dog piss speedrun any%

[0:51:07] <%ThirdWelles> gottem
[0:51:09] <randominternetsurfer> @vendigear I wanna believe Magna really is this hard.
[0:51:12] <DaKnightWarrior> What does Pat main?
[0:51:14] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:51:20] <%BoxNavy> magnamomdo monkaS

[0:51:24] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Father, look how hard I can piss
[0:51:24] <Blank9> 30 tries until you delete and redownload
[0:51:24] <+Mottyrob> Propose marriage harder next time Pat
[0:51:25] <%toastybites> so in theory if you suck really bad you can't complete the demo
[0:51:26] <Vaunno> @darkplague20 GS
[0:51:27] <+OhioNitsud> countdown the quests
[0:51:29] <Vendigear> it may as well be 30 minutes
[0:51:31] <ace_sabo_luffy__> Good luck
[0:51:32] <%Ziegsy> in Canada dogs have to pee super fast to prevent icicle syndrome
[0:51:33] <+itsgundamu> It already is running super well now

[0:55:16] <%ThirdWelles> You're super fucked
[0:55:18] <$floralkami> bruh, wtf
[0:55:20] <allyalice> 15 minutes and his damage on one of his attacks is turned into an instant kill just for the demo :)

[0:55:21] <CappuccinoGuil> yo, we doing Rise and then Mortal Shell?
[0:55:23] <Talen99> game is loud, pat voice is quiet
[0:55:24] <$RealThiele> 15min x 30 tries
[0:55:25] <xeros720> it did build hype for World, so i can see them attempting that again
[0:55:26] <Vaunno> @floralkami just this hard mode hunt
[0:55:27] <Oxybe> Magnamalo fight is 15 minutes
[0:55:32] <bevyrage> @floralkami this hunt is only 15 minutes 'cause it's the impossible difficulty
[0:55:36] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt does it feel like the boar drifting in Nier?
[0:55:36] <+itsgundamu> its fine
[0:55:37] <%BoxNavy> yeah kinda
[0:55:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> seems normal
[0:55:41] <$velgaduere> @Ziegsy which part? the 15 minute timer on a demo quest that's purposefully overtuned against the player? or do you mean the actual games?
[0:55:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> a little but not very
[0:55:42] <$floralkami> aaaaaahh
[0:55:43] <%ThirdWelles> Some guy said 11 minutes for top speedrunners? Already in the danger zone
[0:55:44] <Vaunno> a little loud yeah
[0:55:44] <Ipsenscastle> the dog drifting honestly looks super dumb
[0:55:45] <BoxNavy> a lil bit
[0:55:47] <+GrooovinMagic> The audio is fine
[0:55:47] <%maenos2> yeah it is.
[0:55:47] <VsauceKZ> seems fine to me

[0:55:51] <$floralkami> thanks chat
[0:55:54] <%twoto858> At least compared to you
[0:55:57] <$RealThiele> the water sounds are loud
[0:55:58] <DrkJP520> Click the stick once at the start of a mission to lock on to Magna. prioritizes target
[0:55:59] <PyroDrag> Was that Mizutsune?
[0:56:01] <%PanicSwytch> One Guy
[0:56:04] <+TopTieramisu> so the whole thing about bosses roaming the world in elden ring... that's just a straight up monster hunter encounter, isn't it?

[0:57:29] <Vaunno> SourPls
[0:57:32] <%bevyrage> people have been johnsing on this hunt so much btw. they blame it on the game not running good like world but it's just them getting dedicated to an attack and not bailing out of it each time
[0:57:32] <ScreamLord> Master Utsushi is like a fusion of Kakashi and a Ninja Turtle
[0:57:36] <+itsgundamu> this theme fuckin slaps
[0:57:37] <Saltmeisterr> no its a naginate u BITCH
[0:57:37] <$velgaduere> @Ziegsy fair enough, it's not for everyone
[0:57:39] <%blaggablag> It's a meaner Zinogre
[0:57:45] <Ipsenscastle> i'm not gonna lie to you Pat, it's not looking promising
[0:57:46] <$KnightAsteran> Hellfire, not poison, its like blasty
[0:57:46] <powerprotoman> of course you wont win first try your not using the best weapon in the game, the gunlance
[0:57:47] <BlueSpartan119> @Jaysky hellfire, basically blast

[0:58:26] <waffleandman> could not have said it better LUL
[0:58:26] <DusK_The_Stray> I absolutely hate it, tbh.
[0:58:27] <+julonio5> MISTER MONSTER
[0:58:28] <+Dova573> Who thought to give air fireballs to Nargacugas Tail
[0:58:29] <%Kaask> its not
[0:58:30] <LoreKeeper_Thal> you can turn it off so it's not a problem
[0:58:34] <%AncelDeLambert> It'd be okay if it was Hunter Language, I dunno about English
[0:58:34] <%Ziegsy> the played char always felt too slow when I played
[0:58:35] <DusK_The_Stray> But cool for whoever likes it.
[0:58:36] <$Thatghostpepper> @VsauceKZ with some nergi sprinkled in
[0:58:36] <Visorak6> I'm not a fan but people have the option so w/e
[0:58:36] <therealtacopancakes> I came here and he immediately said like 4 things wtf that's new
[0:58:37] <%ChipRP> i love that they talk now, it gives character to your hunter
[0:58:40] <Oxybe> Hadouken spear tail is dangertown
[0:58:41] <%TrafficCohen> I'll use English voices for the hunters until I get sick of it then switch to Monhun language
[0:58:41] <%blaggablag> The japanes voice makes them sound badass, the english dub is a bit cringe
[0:58:42] <%NopeBadguy> I think they recorded too few lines for how often they talk
[0:58:50] <JackaxeAM> You should mount that Rathian, for beeg damage
[0:58:53] <%Ynkubus_> The only problem with them talking is a couple of the lines dont fit but threst is fine and toggelable
[0:58:56] <gunstars20> I love the corny VO LUL
[0:59:01] <%BoxNavy> didnt add the new attacks though jermaPluto
[0:59:05] <%NopeBadguy> The problem with hunters talking is that they recorded far too little for how often they talk
[0:59:06] <+UberWolfman> ofcourse pat would love the cringe dub
[0:59:06] <+Dorf1> i would hate it if it was just eng or jap but i like how it sounds with the monster hunter language
[0:59:08] <waffleandman> "I think the enemy got the point!"
[0:59:12] <%X2Eliah> Jesus this game has so much noise going off all the time
[0:59:15] <DusK_The_Stray> Going "NOW IT'S PERSONAL" to a fucking animal is peak Moby Dick
[0:59:27] <%NopeBadguy> nice whiff bro
[0:59:28] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:59:28] <Oxybe> beautiful whiff

[0:59:34] <%blaggablag> Them whiffs
[0:59:34] <X2Eliah> Is this how Pachinko parlors feel like?
[0:59:46] <CappuccinoGuil> People who don't like the Hunter's barks, I bet they hate knowing goblins ill like fire
[0:59:47] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Dorf1 so you CAN set it to MH language? thank god
[0:59:54] <%Ynkubus_> "I hope they have insurance" is like one of the only lines I dont like
[0:59:54] <%TrafficCohen> SHHHHHH

[1:00:14] <Jaysky> Nerg is the flagship of TWO games!?
[1:00:19] <$velgaduere> the tail attacks are Velkhana as hell though
[1:00:21] <$KnightAsteran> @LoreKeeper_Thal and you can turn down the frequency of the hunters barks, even sewt it to never speak
[1:00:21] <DusK_The_Stray> That tail movement is all Nargacuga
[1:00:21] <$RealThiele> 109 !
[1:00:22] <Oxybe> yeah, they added rocket launcher to nergigante

[1:04:11] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt Magna's blight is Hellfire, you get rid of it by wiredashing. If you do, it leaves a firebomb in your place that explodes after a while. If you get Magna to walk into it tho he'll get knocked down

[1:04:20] <+Dorf1> the monster hunter localisations have always been ass, its just not the type of game where it matters much

[1:04:23] <Fluffy_Tamamo> "I'm not too worried" ewicaShrug
[1:04:25] <%RD_nx> I wonder if you'll be able to inflict hellfire with a weapon made from this dude

[1:04:47] <blaggablag> IN FAIRNESS the equipment they send you to use on these HR quests is dumb. You usually face these guys with a lot more damage resistance
[1:04:59] <+kullumanati> Not sure what the point of this demo was. BS time limit, not retail boss health. 🤔
[1:05:10] <VsauceKZ> hyoe

[1:06:00] <GoldenGod0> Not an elder just fanged
[1:06:01] <blaggablag> The peak of this ridiculousness was the demo for the Iceborne expansion. The lance kit didn't even have guard maxed. You were eating ice blight the whole way through

[1:09:22] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I saw his butt
[1:09:26] <Firemahci> nah
[1:09:30] <DaKnightWarrior> It really is.
[1:09:32] <Firemahci> Valstrax was worse
[1:09:34] <%viewtifulr> psaGoblin lytBODIED
[1:09:34] <%kyh9> Magnamalo is TOUGH
[1:09:38] <%blaggablag> Velkana was worse
[1:09:40] <Jaysky> And 15 minutes too
[1:09:45] <$KnightAsteran> Nerg was a bitch in the world demos, when you werent using the glitch to apply infinte bomb explosions to your GS
[1:09:46] <%Deekman> do you get anything cool for beating it?
[1:09:47] <Ultra_Pancake> I saw Team Darkside even tweeted that this is the hardest demo monster in their opinion.
[1:09:48] <VsauceKZ> Valstrax was not worse imo
[1:09:49] <+ZeroXI> and its only 15 min hunt
[1:09:50] <crimsonsaens> Velkhana was pretty bad too
[1:09:51] <DaKnightWarrior> The others were easy.
[1:09:52] <samazam94> Valstrax was pretty BS too
[1:09:55] <+Dorf1> every monhun game has had a demo fight like this at tgs
[1:09:57] <RoidRidley> Wasn't Demo Valstrax far tankier?
[1:10:02] <Ipsenscastle> big number
[1:10:06] <Jaysky> Having only 15 minutes to fight him makes the fight stressful
[1:10:06] <+Dorf1> *recent monhun game
[1:10:08] <blackbookalpha> Endemic life is your friend
[1:10:19] <+chiazam> big number
[1:10:22] <%Jaxnos> valstrax was outright mean

[1:11:04] <%maenos2> there are two breads
[1:11:05] <+kullumanati> It’s not hard. It’s a demo poorly designed to be impossible for shock value I guess.
[1:11:12] <%patriotrenegade> Did you know he gets an air dash.
[1:11:14] <LauraKBuzz> Anyone know if they fixed the demo issue from the first demo, where playing online if you had too many Switch friends made the game lag out a bunch?
[1:11:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> BREAD
[1:11:15] <ToneBacas> is 15 minutes even enough do to anything in this demo?
[1:11:17] <%BoxNavy> D:
[1:11:19] <Ultra_Pancake> This really seems like the kind of fight where you want to be patient and not over-commit, but the time limit makes you reckless lol.
[1:11:19] <PinoProxie> oooo pat's in trouble
[1:11:24] <+brickwall35> multiple breads
[1:11:26] <%TheMattman1313> See now Paige want the bread.

[1:11:48] <%X2Eliah> Well it is a serious issue about BREAD
[1:11:48] <%brickwall35> sounds like trouble in paradise
[1:11:49] <DaKnightWarrior> @velgaduere not as hard as you think Magnamalo moves have alot of endlag to punish.
[1:11:49] <+Minorou> heck no, you guys sound great
[1:11:50] <%blaggablag> Yah this is par for course

[1:12:01] <Pookiedaexzile> When this stops thats teh problem
[1:12:03] <Firemahci> Mortal Shell was made by like 4 people
[1:12:06] <Ultra_Pancake> If you've got stale bread, that's just french toast in the making.
[1:12:10] <Firemahci> extremely impressive
[1:12:14] <$floralkami> @tomschiii Mortal Shell wasn't horrible, what??
[1:12:16] <+MassConnect> who needs bread when you can have just ham
[1:12:18] <BlueSpartan119> you see chat, the reason Magna is so overtuned is so you have to buy the game to kill him :)
[1:12:18] <$velgaduere> @DaKnightWarrior if you wanna beat him in this time limit, I feel like it is

[1:13:46] <primaryfire> he has some ssj4 gogeta mixups
[1:13:48] <Klefth> Mannn, I hope the rumors of a PC version 9 months later are true even if 9 months is bullshit

[1:14:23] <LauraKBuzz> @Klefth The PC version is real and confirmed
[1:14:23] <$floralkami> @tomschiii it does if you're trying to compare it to a AAA series backed by decades of experience and tons of money. also how could you not even get past the first area and call it horrible
[1:14:24] <$velgaduere> some moves are baked into the skeleton
[1:14:25] <Profmcstevie> Nerginogre
[1:14:29] <$KnightAsteran> Zinergeostra
[1:14:32] <xeros720> he's Zinogre with a gun

[1:16:09] <%viewtifulr> gore magala duel blades
[1:16:12] <alphonseisbest> i miss him
[1:16:13] <%blaggablag> GORE IS AWESOME
[1:16:13] <DaKnightWarrior> We all do :(
[1:16:15] <+Byronic_dreamer> fucking sick looking garbage
[1:16:16] <+Pep49> I think gore will be in this game down the line
[1:16:17] <ScreamLord> Gore and Shagaru
[1:16:19] <RoidRidley> I mean, Generations Ultimate was the mon hun all stars game
[1:16:19] <$valkuma> im jus ready for Rise to come out on PC and fix all the dumb Switch shenanigans in it.
[1:16:21] <%Jeemukun> but it looks cool
[1:16:24] <$floralkami> @tomschiii you first statement was calling it a horrible souls like, so yes, there is comparison to be made when judging it. and really? the first area being a forest killed it for you? is that it?
[1:16:24] <$KnightAsteran> @AGRO_91 except World nad Rise are on different engines
[1:16:29] <%blaggablag> Also Shigeru Mishagala was nice
[1:16:29] <+taggerung403> Let them fight
[1:16:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> plus you can now transmog so
[1:16:31] <Slim_Lipid> handjobs thinking expacs are brand new games OpieOP
[1:16:31] <Firemahci> Gore Magala is comming, athe roar at the end of the last trailers was Gore's
[1:16:31] <+McSoliace> Gore was just vergil
[1:16:33] <Jaysky> And yeah his fight is fun, his lore is sick, and his weapons were alright
[1:16:35] <+DragonArt07> he may be coming back. apex monsters are normally cause of him
[1:16:35] <+Ynkubus_> We have a glamour system this gen it would be great for that
[1:16:36] <allyalice> apex monsters are back and those are connected to gore arent they?
[1:16:37] <%blaggablag> cool white armor, hella drip
[1:16:39] <+RealPT1> The shedding Gore's gear was kinda alright
[1:16:40] <blaggablag> would fight again
[1:16:41] <$floralkami> @tomschiii I'm honestly asking if that's it
[1:16:44] <$RealThiele> Kaiju time
[1:16:49] <Forulkan> gore magala hunting horn was fun
[1:16:50] <AGRO_91> @KnightAsteran true, is the RE not as good as what world is on?
[1:16:56] <AGRO_91> @KnightAsteran RE engine
[1:17:00] <%Rabbidbunnyz> this fight is so fucking hard lmfao
[1:17:15] <%blaggablag> @Forulkan What was that like? I don't remember the shape
[1:17:18] <Tomschiii> @floralkami souls like is the genre, not the comparison ^^ yeah, the forest area, the first area. not the concept of a forest style lvl
[1:17:20] <waffleandman> all i care about is playing in 60 fps
[1:17:21] <$valkuma> they have entire movesets and combo lists
[1:17:23] <DaKnightWarrior> I would so buy MH4U on Switch, still my fav MH.
[1:17:29] <+Minorou> different moves on your stick direction
[1:17:29] <$floralkami> @tomschiii no comments about the gameplay? the body system? the leveling or the combat design?
[1:17:32] <+Hilleltaco> There are some moves that are button+direction
[1:17:33] <alphonseisbest> ^
[1:17:35] <$KnightAsteran> @AGRO_91 no, Worlds engine was worse and more complicaterd to use, so modders trying to port its shit to other engines will take a fuckin while
[1:17:42] <$Xevtes> YEAH
[1:17:48] <drawertogether> I need to finish Generations ultimate
[1:17:55] <blaggablag> Nice tail hit

[1:18:56] <DaKnightWarrior> I LOVE Magnamalo's theme.
[1:18:59] <$valkuma> this is nergigante for sure

[1:22:53] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah, I called it, it has Nargacuga tail movements
[1:22:54] <+Ultimate_Edge> Did he just do a tail stinger
[1:22:55] <dimensaur> stinger
[1:22:56] <lets_be_friendos> he got zinogre moves too
[1:22:57] <+maenos2> gotta be honest like half these names sound like gibberish

[1:23:05] <%brickwall35> is Pat doing badly?
[1:23:07] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:23:13] <ScreamLord> REVENGANCE
[1:23:14] <huskarl_zap> The Gogagabgalab
[1:23:16] <+MugenSandan> this monster is the Double of MH
[1:23:17] <blackbookalpha> Flagship Combos
[1:23:17] <johnnumbas> he should have a sheathe for his tail
[1:23:18] <JoshManVGH> He's THE DEAD POOL!
[1:23:18] <randominternetsurfer> he's also got Velkhana Tail
[1:23:22] <+CptnCampy61> The flagship all star
[1:23:22] <VsauceKZ> if you turn off the phrases, does your hunter still grunt and stuff in combat?
[1:23:26] <vilecrois> They saw Soul of Cinder and said "we want that"
[1:23:29] <+DukeBlack_> The Ultimate weapon?
[1:23:31] <Vaunno> OH MY GOD IT IS EVERY FLAGSHIP
[1:23:31] <thebreadlord20> by that tail slam logic, glavenus is also Nargacuga
[1:23:32] <DusK_The_Stray> Nergi/Zinogre/Narga tails
[1:23:32] <TrafficCohen> @maenos2 You telling me you don't know Niblesnarf? Teostra? Nargacuga?
[1:23:32] <+Dova573> the Seth of Monster hunter?
[1:23:34] <malesin_01> velkhana tail moves
[1:23:38] <huskarl_zap> Terkunga
[1:23:39] <+Hilleltaco> I kinda get Valstrax stab vibes from his tail stuff too yeah, though that was with wings
[1:23:43] <Zombrocom> THere is only so many moves a giant cat monster can do without overlap
[1:23:44] <Ipsenscastle> was nargacuga a flagship?
[1:23:44] <Vaunno> holy shit, its true...
[1:23:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe it's got different moves based on what monsters are in that rampage story thing, like a culmination of all of them
[1:23:49] <Diablo169> Are these really names or just random mouth noises?
[1:23:53] <lets_be_friendos> seeing these TDS guys beat this dude in like 8 minutes makes you realize how bad you are FeelsBadMan
[1:23:54] <$Jaxnos> something something bet this is connected to the Rampage storywise
[1:23:57] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Ipsenscastle yes, for Freedom Unite
[1:23:57] <VsauceKZ> he should do the valstrax dive bomb
[1:23:58] <huskarl_zap> Sehlungadab
[1:23:59] <nevan_44> this dog named gilbert LUL
[1:24:05] <DusK_The_Stray> It's not that it's a tail slam but that the tail slam is very similarly animated
[1:24:06] <+Zenryoku21> How's Rise? Will it fill the void that MHW left?
[1:24:08] <$RealThiele> noped out
[1:24:10] <+TaurusOxford> LUL, time waster retreat
[1:24:10] <%maenos2> @trafficcohen those could all be namesfor all I know hah
[1:24:11] <Ipsenscastle> @LoreKeeper_Thal thx
[1:24:15] <rosemon5001> malo from twilight princess turned into quite the monster hahaha @PatStaresAt
[1:24:15] <Vendigear> I would liken him more to Valstrax
[1:24:16] <Ultra_Pancake> He's got Zinogre's air breakdance move lol
[1:24:18] <Vaunno> he has valstrax dive kinda
[1:24:19] <Tomschiii> i wonder if they ever bring back underwater combat, remaked or not
[1:24:20] <dizimous> He also tries to bite you, like a dog
[1:24:24] <%ChaoticWaha> ChaoticWaha subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! ye
[1:24:26] <+TaurusOxford> @Zenryoku21 it's World but with a wirebug.
[1:24:29] <Zombrocom> It works more like nergis than zinogres
[1:24:31] <BlueSpartan119> he even has nergi's white spike mechanic
[1:24:33] <+TaurusOxford> that kinda says it all.
[1:24:36] <Vendigear> that's Zin, not Nerg
[1:24:36] <DusK_The_Stray> That's Zinogre
[1:24:41] <Vaunno> hes more of a tiger tbh
[1:24:43] <huskarl_zap> BOARS ARE THE GOATS
[1:24:45] <+GrooovinMagic> Nice! You've got some buddies helping ya.
[1:24:46] <lets_be_friendos> OH NOT THE PIGS

[1:25:00] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:25:01] <RoidRidley> The Pepega slam

[1:25:34] <+maenos2> TICKTOCK GOES THE CLOCK
[1:25:34] <+Dorf1> rajang has a divebomb like that
[1:25:36] <Nested_Dreams> It's a Best-Of-MH Monster
[1:25:47] <Seag0at> For a monster with no wings he sure has a lot of aerial mobility
[1:25:49] <$RealThiele> still in one shot range
[1:25:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kinda hard to tell what the hitbox on those explosive clouds is, at least from a viewer perspective
[1:25:50] <+taggerung403> This is definitely a co-op monster for the demo
[1:25:56] <+symphonicsuplex> throw kunai to piss it off
[1:26:01] <Zombrocom> The strafing tail shots is all him though
[1:26:05] <%Nested_Dreams> HE'S BEING CAREFUL omg
[1:26:06] <+Rabbidbunnyz> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ feels the same playing it
[1:26:06] <Firemahci> you have to get close to him
[1:26:08] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Did his tail hit you on the recoil!? that is dumb

[1:26:21] <randominternetsurfer> @taggerung403 nah, Max and other couldn't take him down in a team either.
[1:26:21] <lets_be_friendos> STUCK FeelsBadMan

[1:26:29] <thebreadlord20> oh lawdy he went sicko mode
[1:26:32] <+chadoinkle> might just wait for the pc port
[1:26:32] <shubachi> Pat needs to call some friends
[1:26:33] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Hows everyone feel about the english voices btw?
[1:26:33] <Vendigear> that's only like his third try
[1:26:34] <+spitelite> this fight is for real
[1:26:37] <$Jaxnos> best part is that you got murdered by the startup of the move, not even the actual move
[1:26:38] <Oxybe> Magnamalo for Fortnite when?
[1:26:40] <Firemahci> I love that you have to do a double superman jump to avoid that
[1:26:44] <huskarl_zap> Piss on its nest so it moves to another state
[1:26:45] <DudeDern> Need better hats
[1:26:51] <+Pep49> except he doesn't fly high in the air
[1:27:20] <lets_be_friendos> did pat get hit with the juggle combo yet?
[1:27:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Rabbidbunnyz ah, oh boy
[1:27:23] <YakumoYomi> Don't worry, Pat. Have you been wyvern riding the other monsters in the area to deal with Magna?
[1:27:24] <Reisadan> Hit the monster until it dies. Pro tactic.
[1:27:25] <%Xevtes> loading times are great
[1:27:35] <+jinking79> demo gear not that great for this hunt
[1:27:37] <Firemahci> that demo GS is really really bad
[1:27:38] <+SShen> SShen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Whens the ron pearlman crossover outfit for the chief
[1:27:43] <+chadoinkle> is this RE engine?
[1:27:45] <Firemahci> Traps work on him tho
[1:27:45] <sendart> they don't really give you enough time to go collect the buff birds
[1:27:48] <+DarkDragoonZero> why does this game seem harder than world?
[1:27:50] <Firemahci> use traps pat
[1:27:54] <+chadoinkle> or can switch not handle it
[1:27:58] <+TaurusOxford> @chadoinkle it is
[1:28:02] <DaKnightWarrior> @chadoinkle yes
[1:28:04] <BlueSpartan119> nope
[1:28:06] <+chadoinkle> oh nice
[1:28:08] <$velgaduere> he's a fanged wyvern, just like Zinogre
[1:28:09] <TrafficCohen> Maybe
[1:28:11] <+Hilleltaco> I assumed the same, but traps totally work
[1:28:11] <lets_be_friendos> fanged wyvern/beast
[1:28:11] <%YakumoYomi> Yep, it's a modified version of the RE engine
[1:28:12] <moosemonkey397> he is not
[1:28:12] <%Xevtes> demo gear is like arena gear. crappy
[1:28:14] <Oxybe> using the IG in the demo is pure masochism
[1:28:15] <$spardanwarrior> Magnamalo is not an elder dragon
[1:28:16] <johnnumbas> demo gear is probably lower than intended too
[1:28:20] <Zombrocom> Fanged Wyvern
[1:28:21] <thebreadlord20> he's like zino
[1:28:24] <+TaurusOxford> traps work on him
[1:28:25] <Divryne> Why is a horse a fucking elder dragon?
[1:28:27] <Reisadan> Hey! Magnamalo WORKS for a living!
[1:28:31] <Agami23> this is just like the demo for world.where nergigante was FUCKED UP
[1:28:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, that's a pretty strong non-elder then
[1:28:33] <blackbookalpha> traps and blightbugs can soften his bum
[1:28:34] <+NopeBadguy> FIGHT CLUB
[1:28:36] <+chadoinkle> Hearing recognisable english in MH is just as jarring as Zelda.
[1:29:06] <ToneBacas> does Monster Hunter look this hectic all the time?
[1:29:06] <$Jaxnos> oh my
[1:29:09] <Firemahci> yeaaaaah
[1:29:12] <Zombrocom> He's a elder dragon tier normal monster. Like Rajang or deviljo or Bazel
[1:29:15] <+Ynkubus_> Ye ye ye
[1:29:15] <SolidusA> Amazing
[1:29:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> monster hunter stories 2 sure got a visual upgrade huh kappa
[1:29:28] <+Hilleltaco> If you take too long after the first wall slam you fall off, you can get up to 3 though

[1:29:41] <RoidRidley> woah his tail is a fluer de lis!
[1:29:44] <Oxybe> soapy boi wants to play too
[1:29:45] <xeros720> tying him down seems really effective
[1:29:49] <+taggerung403> Mizu with the steel chair from behind by god
[1:29:58] <Firemahci> @hilleltaco 4 with the extra bug
[1:30:00] <blackbookalpha> Magna got softened
[1:30:03] <+antpantz> monsters are affected by blights now?
[1:30:15] <+TaurusOxford> yes
[1:30:15] <TrafficCohen> Yeah
[1:30:16] <blackbookalpha> ye
[1:30:20] <Oxybe> his tail is a japanese spear
[1:30:21] <YakumoYomi> That hunter is broken in half. Somebody ring the damn bell!
[1:30:22] <TrafficCohen> New to Rise
[1:30:24] <+Hilleltaco> @Firemahci Oh really? Hadn't thought of that
[1:30:41] <%TrafficCohen> INTO THE SPANISH HUNTER'S TABLE
[1:30:42] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[1:30:43] <blackbookalpha> blightbeetles and toads can be thrown or dropped
[1:31:22] <+TaurusOxford> Just wait till we get Master Rank version of this.
[1:31:24] <Firemahci> you can actually use a lot of the environmental pickups against him
[1:31:24] <@commanderclaw> I feel like even if he's this hard in the full game, being able to select your own items and gear will cut down a lot of the challenge in the demo
[1:31:24] <lets_be_friendos> LUL
[1:31:28] <Daxalog> is this the end of the stream?
[1:31:33] <PinoProxie> it was cool, for him
[1:31:34] <Firemahci> he is pretty fair tbh
[1:31:42] <blackbookalpha> Apex Rajang hehe~
[1:31:43] <TrafficCohen> PSYCHO CRUSHER
[1:31:44] <+DukeBlack_> AIR HIKE?!
[1:31:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THIS MH AIRDASHING
[1:31:51] <+TaurusOxford> @commanderclaw the devs have said that he's not this hard in full game.
[1:31:53] <PyroDrag> he gets an air hike!
[1:31:59] <YakumoYomi> Also, not being restricted to a 15 minute time limit
[1:32:00] <Reisadan> taint slasher
[1:32:00] <+TaurusOxford> he's overtuned specifically for the demo
[1:32:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> THATS ACTUALLY COOL
[1:32:02] <dan_g_v> Are we winning, Son?
[1:32:03] <DrkJP520> He has a fucking Dante air hike
[1:32:12] <BoxNavy> @Daxalog nah hes doin a bit of this then mortal shell
[1:32:13] <@commanderclaw> @TaurusOxford Ah, I see
[1:32:19] <Oxybe> full game we get to properly prep and get our own setups going
[1:32:24] <dan_g_v> doesn't he have a dragon punch too?
[1:32:26] <Reisadan> knock the purple off 'em!
[1:32:28] <ThirdWelles> Use your wirebugs
[1:32:37] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Pat doesnt use the wire recover much does he? Is it a bad idea right now?
[1:32:40] <Daxalog> Did pat ever play Dauntless on stream?
[1:32:43] <Firemahci> use a trap pat
[1:32:50] <DrkJP520> He's using Trickster
[1:32:53] <$velgaduere> but what if use wirebug to not die lobosThink
[1:32:56] <BoxNavy> has he been wirefalling i wasnt looking
[1:32:57] <YakumoYomi> There's no time, Pat!
[1:32:59] <dan_g_v> use your Rathalos, Pat
[1:33:01] <+TaurusOxford> @Fluffy_Tamamo No - pat just doesn't have the muscle memory for it yet
[1:33:03] <JigsK> ah, but what better time to practice than in a demo?
[1:33:04] <+Pep49> I don't know if I'm a fan of the English voices tbh lol I'm on the fence about it
[1:33:05] <dan_g_v> pull it out of your pocket
[1:33:05] <%ThirdWelles> This is true, but do it more than none and you'll survive a bit better lol
[1:33:11] <ExpressNode> I wonder if they are gonna put a Amaterasu skin on those puppers. That would be neat
[1:33:12] <bevyrage> pat uses wirebug recovery well enough to avoid getting merc'd. he's already doing better than max who refuses to use wirebugs outside of attacking
[1:33:15] <Oxybe> only one trap. silly demo.
[1:33:17] <kammerdood> I'll definitely wait for the PC release of this
[1:33:19] <Fluffy_Tamamo> yeah, thats fair
[1:33:20] <thatlolifrompersona1> Does he know how long max tried this qtpPOINT
[1:33:23] <BoxNavy> :tf:
[1:33:25] <+Pep49> I miss the gibberish speak
[1:33:29] <Daxalog> "Come over here and slip on it!"
[1:33:31] <+symphonicsuplex> quick throw kunai at he ass
[1:33:40] <%ThirdWelles> NICE
[1:33:45] <%ThirdWelles> FAT DAMAGE TIME
[1:33:52] <BoxNavy> its shit like that that makes me wonder why people play greatsword lol
[1:33:54] <Visorak6> enraged monsters break out of traps quicker
[1:33:55] <lets_be_friendos> never get greedy with the full charge
[1:33:56] <+antpantz> WHAT

[1:34:33] <Oxybe> you play greatsword for BIG NUMBERS ON SCREEN. it's a good reason to use it.

[1:34:41] <YakumoYomi> Nergigante was like this in the World beta, and then he was a bitch in the retail version
[1:34:44] <BlackStarAura> this huge bitch
[1:34:44] <Alzero83> Cut off his dick and wear it
[1:34:59] <DrkJP520> The voice lines are cheezy as hell. MH is goofy, but the hunts were always, in contrast, serious business
[1:35:06] <+TaurusOxford> Velkhana WAS this bad however.
[1:35:07] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Funny, the demo's GS doesn't have very big numbers. ewicaShrug
[1:35:08] <%bevyrage> world is also the easiest monhun game in the series
[1:35:09] <dan_g_v> Nergi confirmed for an actual bitch
[1:35:11] <+TaurusOxford> in the IB demo
[1:35:12] <$velgaduere> beta Nerg was tougher than game Nerg, but not even this hard
[1:35:17] <Firemahci> as a GS main for Iceborne GS on rise is kind of underwhelming /:
[1:35:38] <+TaurusOxford> @Firemahci that's cause we don't have focus decos in the demo.
[1:35:42] <+RahuHordika> THAT'S FROM GORE
[1:35:44] <+Rabbidbunnyz> you haven't gotten to build for it yet lmao
[1:35:47] <Tomschiii> @bevyrage hard is not always better :)
[1:35:49] <dan_g_v> Did Max got to kill Magnamalo yesterday?
[1:35:52] <+TaurusOxford> @Firemahci nor do we have the better switch skills.
[1:35:57] <%Rabbidbunnyz> for all we know there's black x tier build for GS in rise
[1:35:59] <Oxybe> remember that this is low level gear, likely no deco or anything.
[1:36:00] <PyroDrag> oh my monkaS
[1:36:09] <dan_g_v> big damage
[1:36:13] <+Grayhammatter> it has a RAILGUN?
[1:36:19] <DublinRage> ...Isn't there actual footage of Pat losing to said bitch in the beta?
[1:36:19] <xeros720> Megna actually has a gun
[1:36:24] <+Hilleltaco> the good greatsword staggers Kreygasm

[1:36:44] <socratetris> Quick, sharpen your health bar or something like that
[1:36:44] <+McSoliace> @dan_g_v he got close a few times but no
[1:36:56] <+TaurusOxford> @viewtifulr you mean that dead mechanic? Nope. Kappa
[1:37:02] <sendart> I love the monster's but wiggle after doing the tail stab
[1:37:11] <+spitelite> i bet his insect glaive and charge blade will look sick

[1:39:20] <+Ironbuttz> all the weapons are viable.  learn them all
[1:39:28] <PyroDrag> PogChamp
[1:39:36] <SilasDrekken> that was almost sick
[1:39:36] <BlackStarAura> I can't play this myself, so I'm watching Pat do it. These monsters are too damn big!
[1:39:43] <Oxybe> worse in rise demo? i'd say IG. i love it but we're missing tools that will be in the full game to really take advanage of the weapon.
[1:39:49] <samazam94> Lance's biggest problem is that all of its attacks looks pretty meh compared to other weapon
[1:39:53] <DudeDern> @firemahci true, I just want to know if pat has a take
[1:40:06] <DudeDern> There are no bad weapons in monster hunter

[1:43:08] <Firemahci> still a loss under pat rules, crazy talk is the best
[1:43:12] <Blank9> GS isn't a great match for him
[1:43:14] <dan_g_v> A Deviant Magnamalo in the making
[1:43:17] <+Pep49> yeah I beat him with hunting horn
[1:43:21] <Talen99> So are you playing snail souls now?
[1:43:24] <%coward_man> so how is the monster hunting?
[1:43:24] <alphonseisbest> JE SUIS MONTE
[1:43:26] <+julonio5> 2 DEMOs
[1:43:26] <%Agami23> its like a nargacuga and teostra had a baby
[1:43:27] <AllenDeadman> same
[1:43:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah he'll be also glowing
[1:43:45] <%Mrbaconator> jeez pat how come your mom lets you have 2 demos
[1:43:46] <+Pep49> took alot of tries tho
[1:43:47] <Pookiedaexzile> With a element we haven;t seen probably
[1:43:49] <DaKnightWarrior> Good hunts pat.
[1:43:49] <dan_g_v> coffee break!!!
[1:43:55] <%neroforte177> i mean by then you have better gear/ weapons
[1:44:01] <Puffmax> naw the first time you meet Mangomelon will be a gathering quest as per tradition
[1:44:04] <Firemahci> He did pretty good tbh
[1:44:04] <+Pep49> bawkGo
[1:44:12] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Funny, I thought he'd let chat carry him to victory.
[1:44:22] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Solos only I guess
[1:44:49] <Pookiedaexzile> People like "He did so bad"  did you see the damage numbers he was putting out on single hits
[1:44:52] <Profmcstevie> Solo victory is the only victory worth fighting for coneyWOKE
[1:44:56] <Puffmax> 4P malo hunts are a chaotic mess
[1:45:06] <huskarl_zap> Scholar + King = too much drip
[1:45:23] <dan_g_v> Hunts gotta be a chaotic mess with much many booms
[1:45:58] <Firemahci> I think the strongest builds for the demo are HH, SA, and LS
[1:46:28] <%viewtifulr> did pat try to trap the monster? havent seen it myself of him doing so
[1:46:28] <BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:46:52] <Firemahci> @viewtifulr He did once
[1:47:09] <Fluffy_Tamamo> traps dont involve a big sword getting swung, so no. nyannSmug
[1:47:20] <Puffmax> pitfalls work well on malo but it increases its hellfire guage
[1:47:24] <%Trenr> hi hello what have I missed so far
[1:47:29] <+queaks> Is he done with the demo?
[1:47:44] <%viewtifulr> really it does that @puffmax
[1:47:44] <Firemahci> @trenr PAIN
[1:47:55] <+Grayhammatter> pat getting washed by the magnamalo, and switching to mortal shell
[1:47:58] <%Trenr> FUCK. That's the best part.
[1:48:05] <%neroforte177> wait @chat did pat never play mortal shell before?
[1:48:08] <Profmcstevie> Hellfire gauge.....not a name I expected a Monhun enemy to have
[1:48:32] <+Eternal_Nihilism> Was he going in solo?
[1:48:43] <Firemahci> yup
[1:48:55] <pnkpanther> did i miss monhun or is he goin back in after?
[1:49:08] <+Eternal_Nihilism> Well now I have to play the demo.
[1:49:23] <Firemahci> he's doing Mortal Shell now
[1:49:29] <%Ziegsy> did they lower the amount of flashes during the elmo dance? because that used to be triggering
[1:49:48] <ExpressNode> @pnkpanther He just finished and I think he's going to the next game
[1:50:02] <Puffmax> @viewtifulr yeah pitfalls speeds up the hellfire build up and causes it to do its big explosion run, shock traps appear to not affect buildup but they don't work as well
[1:50:07] <KazamiArt> what weapon does pat main again?
[1:50:16] <Firemahci> gs
[1:50:33] <KazamiArt> oof
[1:50:58] <pnkpanther> can't wait to try to main GS in rise. so far i've only done dexy weapons in monhun, bow, ds, ig
[1:51:07] <%TamsynRRD> Because big number
[1:51:51] <+MelodyMedley> So is Pat gonna like Mortal Shell?
[1:52:03] <+enternius> Probably not
[1:52:04] <%TamsynRRD> I mained GS in world.  Gonna do doot flute in Rise
[1:52:08] <+MassConnect> am I going to like Mortal Shelll?
[1:52:09] <+enternius> It's super janky
[1:52:16] <+enternius> Probably
[1:52:18] <+Eternal_Nihilism> probably not
[1:52:32] <Firemahci> it is janky
[1:52:38] <+enternius> Mortal Shell reminds me of Dark Souls 2
[1:52:50] <+MelodyMedley> Fun jank or bad jank?
[1:52:56] <$Dakuu75> Reload~
[1:52:59] <+enternius> Do you remember the Falconer enemies in DS2? WIth the busted running animations? The entire game feels like that
[1:53:03] <+MassConnect> jonk jank?
[1:53:12] <+MelodyMedley> Oh
[1:53:26] <%brickwall35> jank it off
[1:53:30] <%Ziegsy> has pat played hellpoint? Cus that was jank,, but kinda fun
[1:53:32] <+thickshield> Mortal shell has a bit of a speed bump in the early game. I still had fun with it
[1:53:34] <%BigDumBeak> bigdum1Krukhchamp  more jank than lords of the fallen?
[1:53:34] <BlackStarAura> doggy snore
[1:53:35] <+enternius> Ashen was decent
[1:53:43] <+TaurusOxford> Not as bad as those.
[1:53:45] <PinoProxie> you gonna stream pascal's wager?
[1:53:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just do it
[1:53:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> coward
[1:53:56] <+Grayhammatter> jrank
[1:53:56] <%Tman451> it feels like a slightly less jenk DS2 to me, but still jenk for sure
[1:53:57] <+MelodyMedley> Jrank! Jrank!
[1:53:57] <%slimmixrp> Didn't seem too jank. Really polished low budget
[1:54:03] <%Townspoon> Finally, the world will know
[1:54:06] <samazam94> its actually pretty polished, all things considered
[1:54:08] <dizimous> I literally forgot I had ashen, I guess I should get back to that eventually
[1:54:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> No ideea
[1:54:10] <Zeif00> Janklikes
[1:54:12] <+MassConnect> is this the anime one?
[1:54:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Is it unfair to call a soulslike jank if Souls are jank
[1:54:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt How's Remnant: From The Ashes?
[1:54:23] <%Deekman> from the movie
[1:54:27] <$RealThiele> woosh
[1:54:28] <%SShen> MH movie has pearlman as admiral
[1:54:30] <%Tearonex> ?????????????/
[1:54:32] <%Deft_Thought> Monster Hunter World movie
[1:54:34] <%Ynkubus_> Never
[1:54:41] <%Ynkubus_> He means Admiral I assume
[1:54:49] <%Daxalog> what brand?
[1:54:51] <tanarath> Hey Pat. oh man dc hbomax ad.
[1:55:00] <BoxNavy> wow
[1:55:02] <%coward_man> above all else that would be rude
[1:55:03] <%Mendin> Paige is -always- in t he top part of your vision
[1:55:05] <+enternius> HeyGuys Videogames
[1:55:06] <%Mendin> Because you're short
[1:55:11] <BoxNavy> is this video games?
[1:55:13] <tanarath> Zack Snyder... god
[1:55:18] <+DJAllblue> that armor looks cool
[1:55:19] <+MelodyMedley> Bideo Gems
[1:55:22] <BoxNavy> w a a h
[1:55:27] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, which game is this?
[1:55:33] <%Gamblitz> The Island of Dr Moreau has Both Ron Pearlman and Marlon Brando
[1:55:40] <ThirdWelles> oh sweet I'm back just in time for that game that looked kinda mediocre
[1:55:44] <DublinRage> Is the MH movie at least fun bad?
[1:55:50] <Ipsenscastle> I'm kinda lookin' forward to the Outriders co-op streams, it's gonna be fun on a bun
[1:55:53] <%AncelDeLambert> that sure is a lot of flaps for a poniard to get caught in
[1:55:54] <%ThirdWelles> I hope that it is the good game
[1:55:57] <+enternius> It looks good graphically
[1:55:57] <xeros720> praise mediocrity
[1:56:05] <%AncelDeLambert> psaBougie
[1:56:08] <+enternius> But the mechanics and animations all feel like Lords of the Fallen
[1:56:14] <%DappercatEsquire> The hardening mechanic seems neat
[1:56:16] <%Gamblitz> but dat Unreal!
[1:56:16] <%Daxalog> You said it looked like shit on the podcast
[1:56:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, then I give no fucks about this
[1:56:19] <+chadoinkle> it was egs exclusive
[1:56:21] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Oh, I seen Max play this.
[1:56:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I'M SO SICK OF SOULSIANS
[1:56:23] <+MelodyMedley> I didn't know that this had come out either
[1:56:26] <Profmcstevie> It dribbled out
[1:56:28] <%Ziegsy> what was that cartoony souls like that was horrid?
[1:56:29] <%bevyrage> the only thing i like about mortal shell is the hardening ability that knight gets as a class feature. it's such a neat way to just armor through big hits
[1:56:31] <%coward_man> didn't you stream the original release? Or am I crazy?
[1:56:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> from what I remember this plays kinda cool
[1:56:32] <+chadoinkle> its very polished but it doesnt really have anything unique about it
[1:56:34] <+chadoinkle> its decent
[1:56:38] <tanarath> Pat, have you played Code Vein?
[1:56:43] <%YakumoYomi> It came out last year for PS4/XB1 and was EGS exclusive, yeah?
[1:56:44] <%ThirdWelles> I watched Otzdarva play it a while ago and it looked ..... interesting?
[1:56:53] <+RahkshiLord> this game had potential but the gameplay just isn't there imo
[1:56:53] <%bevyrage> nah you're thinking of max @coward_man
[1:56:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wow Pat, way to show how nonchalant you are about not caring about a thing

[1:57:13] <%Deekman> wait did you leave it on?
[1:57:15] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, he played a few hours of Code Vein on stream at release

[1:59:56] <Paciboyy> he became a ball
[1:59:58] <%Mrbaconator> THE PARRY IS A NO SELL
[1:59:58] <Firemahci> get haaaard
[1:59:58] <TamsynRRD> Use Harden!
[1:59:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Had to cut away for that? LUL
[1:59:59] <CappuccinoGuil> 100% full block on ALL directions.
[2:00:00] <Djinnazz> I stopped playing this after I got that weird bug that locks at the loading screen and then deletes your save.
[2:00:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's block
[2:00:03] <lets_be_friendos> this game was made by like 10 people or something
[2:00:04] <%ThirdWelles> oh
[2:00:04] <$RealThiele> he saw your hardness and ran
[2:00:06] <Ipsenscastle> who is this for, this aesthetic is super off-putting
[2:00:06] <%ThirdWelles> Okay bye
[2:00:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a shield
[2:00:13] <%Mendin> Did that knight Wakanda Forever and leave
[2:00:13] <%Deekman> this is actually kinda cool
[2:00:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @Mrbaconator this is not a parry, it's a block. Parry is coming up
[2:00:28] <Jaysky> Something about the weight in your swings in this are bad
[2:00:30] <%DappercatEsquire> HALLOWED, not HOLLOWED
[2:00:32] <+SocialMisfitGamer> CUT HIM UP
[2:00:34] <+MelodyMedley> Oh yeah!
[2:00:34] <+Grayhammatter> ye, the jank
[2:00:35] <%Gamblitz> dah mocap
[2:00:38] <%arcielardor> I think it looks neat in a geiger way
[2:00:40] <huskarl_zap> called a hollow sword
[2:00:46] <%Townspoon> Bearer of the hardness. ***
[2:00:49] <SolidusA> "inspired"
[2:00:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, try using Harden mid-combo
[2:00:51] <+BettyMwwaahh> how else do you hold a claymore?
[2:00:53] <%Kaask> it cant be as bad as lords of the fallen, right?
[2:00:54] <ScreamLord> [Maximum Armor]
[2:00:55] <$Dakuu75> How many different ways can you hold a fucking Claymore, @PatStaresAt ?
[2:01:00] <$RealThiele> White not-knight Okaysword
[2:01:06] <%ThirdWelles> I mean you can only do so much with a "proper" medieval sword, to be fair
[2:01:06] <BoxNavy> that was sick
[2:01:07] <Djinnazz> no it's not
[2:01:07] <%maybefalco> oh shit that was cool
[2:01:08] <+BettyMwwaahh> IS IT PAT
[2:01:09] <%king_wragles> How many ways are you going to carry a 20 pound 3 foot long sword?
[2:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, that was good
[2:01:12] <Skeleton_Sama> DO COMBO
[2:01:12] <BoxNavy> :)
[2:01:14] <Jaysky> Did you swing with the blade and hit with the hilt?
[2:01:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:01:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, Claymore's are a real life weapon
[2:01:15] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[2:01:17] <%arcielardor> Well how else are you supposed to hold it?
[2:01:18] <huskarl_zap> Sticky white slime gets hardened
[2:01:19] <Ekaelis> It's not like Dark Souls invented new ways to hold a sword
[2:01:19] <%BigDumBeak> be hard
[2:01:20] <%Deft_Thought> psaWhat psaHoldon
[2:01:21] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[2:01:22] <+D00msDayDan> oh i'm gonna experiment with hardening alright

[2:01:25] <baneofthewicked> Dont mind if i do Kappa
[2:01:25] <ExpressNode> They knew what they were writing
[2:01:25] <%twoto858> lewd
[2:01:25] <+SilverDevilfish> Nanomachines son
[2:01:26] <MacMog> you could sword-swallow it
[2:01:26] <Oxybe> obviously you hold the claymore by the blade and baseball bat swing the guard at folks
[2:01:26] <%AncelDeLambert> a helm-breaker hold, very nice
[2:01:26] <%ThirdWelles> Attack to get big
[2:01:26] <+SocialMisfitGamer> you have to start you attack animation after you harden, I dont know about that...
[2:01:27] <Firemahci> the devs knew lol
[2:01:29] <nevan_44> AH YEAH
[2:01:34] <MacMog> not very practical
[2:01:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, parry
[2:01:35] <%coward_man> yeah I remember my body experimenting with hardening during high school
[2:01:36] <%IncredibleMeh> we are fucking children
[2:01:37] <%Movemeister> maximum harden, metapod Kreygasm
[2:01:42] <+kullumanati> Oh my god a dark souls claymore in a souls-like game. How weird?
[2:01:42] <$RealThiele> Wakanda forever
[2:01:44] <Paciboyy> this death animation is really fucking funny
[2:01:48] <+TheCrispyBoi> man that roll looks bad
[2:01:58] <ChoculaUltra> you could drag a claymore/2hander around like a himbo like some pieces of media like to depict
[2:02:01] <Firemahci> Thy flesh hardens
[2:02:06] <%vaporousTippler> This is just Senator Armstrong without nanomachines, huh?
[2:02:11] <SolidusA> thats what she sad
[2:02:12] <%ThirdWelles> Do you have pause combos?
[2:02:32] <pmda2126> Colossus with a sword
[2:02:35] <thunka10> he got a warframe face
[2:02:37] <OldManDeckardCain> that's what she said Kappa
[2:02:38] <$RealThiele> that Chiron scroll is way too slow
[2:02:41] <LunarRemix> You look like a Sectopod from Xcom 2
[2:02:41] <PyroDrag> little hard man Kappa
[2:02:43] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I dub thee.....HARD MAN
[2:02:45] <Firemahci> oh my god
[2:02:49] <ScreamLord> @vaporousTippler Reminds me more of Crysis Nanosuit's Armor Mode
[2:02:52] <%Gamblitz> this looks like one of those Engine Tech Demos that never gonna see the light outside of trade shows
[2:02:56] <DSD24> Die HardMan
[2:02:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're my little hard man, yes you are!
[2:03:01] <%ThirdWelles> I also refer to mine as "My little hard man"
[2:03:04] <+luftraumm1> hard man is kinda cool
[2:03:05] <%ThirdWelles> Relatable
[2:03:07] <orochisdayoff> Hardman LUL
[2:03:11] <%arcielardor> I HAVE NO MOUTH BUT I MUST HARDEN.
[2:03:12] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah animations are trying their best
[2:03:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:03:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> They spelled it wrong lmao
[2:03:22] <Firemahci> when you die do the  enemies yell DIE HARDMAN!
[2:03:27] <+MelodyMedley> Hadern LUL
[2:03:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Okay, beat Asylum Demon now LUL
[2:03:30] <dan_g_v> Hardman!

[2:03:31] <+SilverDevilfish> Defeat Metapod
[2:03:33] <%UvBenServed> Holy shit LUL
[2:03:34] <%Gamblitz> He's Harder.....
[2:03:34] <MacMog> but the Softening Gel costs real money
[2:03:36] <Skeleton_Sama> THIS BATTLE DETERMINES WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE CALLED HARD
[2:03:36] <+MassConnect> Ha, Nerd
[2:03:37] <PyroDrag> HE EVEN HARDENS
[2:03:38] <%Mendin> Iudex Hadern
[2:03:38] <%Pappajimbo> brock hardcheese
[2:03:38] <%SomersaultJustice> just call him Metapod
[2:03:42] <ExpressNode> In a world where you get hard for your enemies
[2:03:42] <%ThirdWelles> okay the people that made this are perverts
[2:03:46] <+yukichocomilk> Die Hardman
[2:03:47] <huskarl_zap> YO THE HARD OFF PogChamp

[2:03:48] <shubachi> James Hadern
[2:03:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @ReallyBigRocks don't think it's wrong, just a really poor attempt at making a name "cool" LUL
[2:03:56] <%AncelDeLambert> the sound design is not good
[2:03:57] <orochisdayoff> HARDENMAN LUL
[2:03:58] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Does Hard Man has a Hard Gauge next to his health?
[2:04:02] <+MelodyMedley> Don't forget to be hard Pat lol
[2:04:03] <%ThirdWelles> I don't wanna look at no grey Gieger penis
[2:04:07] <$RealThiele> Hard Man is weak to the Magnet Missile
[2:04:08] <+luftraumm1> its really interesting that in the last few years a lot of developers tried to emulate h r giger or beksinski aesthetics  with absolutely zero success
[2:04:10] <LunarRemix> You have A LOT of stamina for the start of the game
[2:04:19] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Oh no his health turns into a harden meter
[2:04:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> That man was harder than you
[2:04:26] <%mike2hands> METAPOD THE GAME
[2:04:27] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a weird system of trading
[2:04:27] <PyroDrag> scripted loss?
[2:04:30] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Try Harder, Hard Man
[2:04:30] <%DianaTheAscian> @AllenDeadman oh boy its not great

[2:05:08] <$RealThiele> Failgrim
[2:05:11] <Discount_CJ> I just joined what did I miss from this game?
[2:05:11] <ChoculaUltra> ooo Fallgrim
[2:05:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow I hope all the names are that bad
[2:05:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Now we begin
[2:05:18] <+DJAllblue> lol
[2:05:19] <%Mendin> Fallgrim
[2:05:23] <%Xevtes> thats too slow
[2:05:24] <Paciboyy> this seems... bad
[2:05:25] <+SocialMisfitGamer> No one should be able to beat Hard Man
[2:05:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @Discount_CJ you missed Pat getting hard
[2:05:30] <Borkbiff > That slow-ass animation
[2:05:33] <%Kaask> why was it so slow
[2:05:33] <+MelodyMedley> I can already tell that this is gonna be something
[2:05:34] <DSD24> Nice health
[2:05:35] <%YakumoYomi> That was entirely too slow

[2:05:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Let's get out of Fallgrim and head to Grimdark. And from there, we'll go up to Darkfall
[2:05:44] <$RealThiele> Orphan should be nearby
[2:05:51] <%ThirdWelles> Man, that sprint looks like Chris Evans running on that rig they built to drag him along the ground for Captain America
[2:05:59] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:06:01] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Oh that's bad
[2:06:02] <%Xevtes> a vignette
[2:06:03] <LunarRemix> Oh no
[2:06:04] <ToneBacas> it's the reflection shader
[2:06:05] <Djinnazz> meh
[2:06:06] <Jaysky> Oh fuck I didn't notice before
[2:06:06] <%coward_man> oh that's awful
[2:06:06] <Oxybe> haha the milkiness of the water is camera based
[2:06:07] <$Dakuu75> yeah
[2:06:08] <BoxNavy> is it a weird vignetting?
[2:06:08] <Jaysky> Goddamit
[2:06:09] <+MelodyMedley> Oh no now I see it
[2:06:10] <+enternius> It's a trick of the way reflections work
[2:06:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it's light reflection, Pat
[2:06:12] <Discount_CJ> @CappuccinoGuil Damn ill have to check the vod for that
[2:06:12] <ToneBacas> it's screens-space reflections
[2:06:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's just some screen space reflection nonsense
[2:06:14] <danknugglit> Gobolins
[2:06:14] <%Tman451> DS3 drives me crazy with that in some areas
[2:06:15] <reonome> i think its screen space reflections or a vignette
[2:06:16] <+raviel_avem> raviel_avem subscribed with Prime. 
[2:06:16] <BlueBiscuitGT> Loading screen hidden
[2:06:17] <Jaysky> Now that's all I'm going to notice
[2:06:18] <ExpressNode> I never noticed that but now that I do it is annoying
[2:06:19] <%bevyrage> OH LOOK AT THAT ARMPIT IT'S INVISIBLE
[2:06:19] <Borkbiff > That jank-ass transition too
[2:06:19] <%Mr_Pylon> Like the camera is a light source?
[2:06:22] <%coward_man> you can see through your armpit
[2:06:23] <%datamonkey> it's screen-space reflections
[2:06:24] <%ThirdWelles> oof
[2:06:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reflection
[2:06:27] <%ThirdWelles> That's pretty not good
[2:06:30] <DazzlingFuhrer> Is this FF7R?
[2:06:32] <+SocialMisfitGamer> You did, I see the black lines
[2:06:34] <UncleBust> cool cave
[2:06:35] <%Mendin> Lookit them ribs wiggle
[2:06:36] <%YakumoYomi> Loading corridor?
[2:06:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, it's called a fucking reflection of light you idiot
[2:06:37] <%ThirdWelles> How fucking long is this tunnel
[2:06:38] <DSD24> This tunnel makes no sense
[2:06:39] <%AncelDeLambert> So this is the Bed of Chaos, right?
[2:06:39] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:06:40] <danknugglit> Epic

[2:06:44] <Jaysky> Creepy
[2:06:46] <$RealThiele> MORTAL CRAWL
[2:06:47] <+luftraumm1> his mesh could be better mapped to work with the texture
[2:06:47] <@commanderclaw> That's screen space reflection, and the only solution is raytracing unfortunately
[2:06:48] <%ThirdWelles> And are they REALLY making you crawl the entire way?
[2:06:49] <%Gamblitz> I hope this game reflects the HUD
[2:06:49] <reonome> wow this is a long loading screen
[2:06:53] <DSD24> Impossible Space
[2:06:54] <LunarRemix> This is weird
[2:06:54] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is now vertical
[2:06:54] <ExpressNode> Climbing out of the fish hole
[2:06:55] <+hakma> What a thrill
[2:06:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea
[2:06:59] <%hrbeck_> We are being birthed
[2:06:59] <%twoto858> are you being born?

[2:07:00] <%YakumoYomi> Still in a dream...
[2:07:00] <dan_g_v> another fucking Forest Temple corridor
[2:07:00] <critfumble_> what a thrill
[2:07:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @Discount_CJ nah, it's us joking about the Hardening mechanic in this game. But it is legit a cool system. Full block at any time, can be used mid-combo to pause hits and block anything
[2:07:01] <+SocialMisfitGamer> It's a loading tunnel
[2:07:02] <+vicar_anat> hardman crawling in tunnel, is this a metaphor?
[2:07:02] <%Mr_Pylon> time to climb this rock intestine
[2:07:03] <+OhioNitsud> is he crawling through a giants colon?
[2:07:03] <Paciboyy> you are a fetus thats the plot
[2:07:05] <orochisdayoff> but hole
[2:07:05] <%coward_man> the flow of gravity is convuluted

[2:07:10] <%UvBenServed> Are you crawling out a fish ass?

[2:07:39] <$RealThiele> thanks skele-mom
[2:07:40] <%hrbeck_> It’s one of those cliff holes
[2:07:41] <Paciboyy> This game looks like infinite versus EX
[2:07:41] <BlueBiscuitGT> Yes thats a checkpoint
[2:07:43] <Louie_Salmon> The mortal shell is the shell of jank you can't escape
[2:07:44] <+luftraumm1> this developer was really impatient for skorn eh
[2:07:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Stop being so critical
[2:07:46] <%coward_man> this game is already pretty jank, but pretty though
[2:07:46] <%ThirdWelles> Hey game devs maybe don't do a closeup on the jank
[2:07:48] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Random note; there's a DOTA anime on Netflix
[2:07:51] <Firemahci> TBH Pat would be better off playing Code Vein
[2:07:51] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit it's the grave of the ashless

[2:08:06] <+hakma> @Firemahci Code vein is horrible man
[2:08:08] <lets_be_friendos> this game was made by 15 people cut it some slack
[2:08:08] <BoxNavy> D:
[2:08:09] <%AncelDeLambert> it IS the game about stealing bodies, oh fuck
[2:08:10] <%ThirdWelles> Get vored by the armor

[2:10:28] <+Gespens> @EuropanLamprey It's called half-swording. It's a common thing knights did when they needed to basically bash someone's skull in.

[2:18:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't know if that was SUPPOSED to happen
[2:18:04] <%baronblank> what the
[2:18:05] <+enternius> That grown is just a slowed down and pitched down version of the normal enemies, did you hear that
[2:18:05] <KaiGoesMoo> LUL
[2:18:07] <%DappercatEsquire> ???
[2:18:08] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[2:18:09] <Radioactivetaco9> if you can get ragdolled that I hard there are probably speedrunning skips with it
[2:18:11] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, this is broken
[2:18:12] <dan_g_v> it knocked the You out of You

[2:18:29] <+Gamblitz> 10 out a 10
[2:18:29] <waffleandman> it did the hulk end game thing LUL
[2:18:37] <huskarl_zap> lol
[2:18:38] <xeros720> like losing your power in a kirby game i guess
[2:18:43] <+enternius> LUL
[2:18:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Those crossbow bolts have some nice sound design ngl
[2:18:49] <Profmcstevie> whooshing arrow sound is a nice touch
[2:18:49] <Paciboyy> pat is a secret bear
[2:18:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> *pshew*
[2:19:01] <otakon17> you get ONE chance to retrieve your shell before you die
[2:19:02] <CappuccinoGuil> @Visorak6 you get a 2nd life if you die and you can get back into your shell or continue fighting outside of it. If he dies again, he is dead
[2:19:05] <pmda2126> it is like kirby
[2:19:10] <otakon17> and it recharges upon visitng "bonfires"
[2:19:10] <%Mendin> @Paciboyy No we know he's very smooth
[2:19:10] <$RealThiele> take your drugs
[2:19:14] <%hax_metatron> This game is actually really fun. The last area is probably one of the best looking Anor Londo-like areas in a Souls-like game (Also funny how all Soulslikes want to do an Anor Londo moment now LUL)
[2:19:17] <+enternius> OSFrog
[2:19:17] <+TensecondTarvis> why does every enemy sound like they are squeezing one last shit out when dying?
[2:19:18] <+Exicuren> So that's the solution they came up to the "retrieve your blood stain"
[2:19:24] <+enternius> OSFrog OSFrog
[2:19:24] <Tomschiii> get used to it. its quite annoying in here imo
[2:19:24] <Zombrocom> The deathrattles in this game are out of control

[2:29:13] <PinoProxie> "she lied"
[2:29:16] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Was that rattle in the game!?
[2:29:23] <Jaysky> @notsoaccurateno1 Never heard of a games saves being blocked by an anti virus
[2:29:24] <+swesterly> @RahkshiLord no i have also played dark souls 2 KappaHD
[2:29:29] <%ThirdWelles> You put the rock juice in him
[2:29:32] <+SocialMisfitGamer> That sounded really weird
[2:29:36] <CappuccinoGuil> I like the VA in this, but they take WAY too long to read their lines for D R A M A
[2:29:54] <+MelodyMedley> Skill tree huh?
[2:29:55] <%Cuddl3F1st> btw Pat, all the classes have individual xp and skills, level them separately
[2:29:59] <%ThirdWelles> Gravel voice for gravel people. Fitting
[2:30:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Glimpses are a secondary currency
[2:30:00] <+enternius> Yeah this entire game's sound design is uncomfortable
[2:30:01] <Jaysky> No laugh at the end this isn't Dark Douls
[2:30:13] <cheerfulnpc> sounds like someone doing a bad impression of Temuera Morrison.
[2:30:14] <blaggablag> f r o g
[2:30:19] <+enternius> They used an ASMR microphone for all of it it feels like
[2:30:22] <%ThirdWelles> Oh, shell swap item
[2:30:24] <%ThirdWelles> probably
[2:30:26] <Visorak6> An effigy is like a humanity maybe?
[2:30:27] <Jaysky> am frog
[2:30:27] <LunarRemix> We utter nonsense here in this land
[2:30:28] <BlackStarAura> devil frogs
[2:30:31] <LunarRemix> We don't laugh
[2:30:35] <%ThirdWelles> This audio is crunchy.
[2:30:54] <+enternius> Sounds really rough with headphones
[2:30:55] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @Jaysky bitdefender didn't even give me a notification that it was doing that. Just the game saving icon would pop up then bitdefender comes in scooping up the save file and slam dunking it into the shredder.
[2:30:58] <xeros720> visions of being a badass
[2:31:01] <+enternius> Like all of the sound is inside your brain
[2:31:10] <+swesterly> take a look back in that room
[2:31:20] <ak150> Chisel and hammer.
[2:31:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Not really
[2:31:27] <lilmac64> Is it a knife or a stake>
[2:31:28] <BlackStarAura> ooh
[2:31:29] <xeros720> "these could be you for the low low price of vestaments!"
[2:31:33] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> it's 1 of 2 issues I've ever had with bitdefender so I guess that's a good track record compared to literally any other antivirus
[2:31:36] <+swesterly> go back

[2:33:05] <+MelodyMedley> This game seems like it might be good?
[2:33:06] <BlackStarAura> Giant birds, like Dark Souls
[2:33:06] <+enternius> It's way lamer @ThirdWelles
[2:33:08] <waffleandman> is that a hat or his nose?

[2:33:45] <%ThirdWelles> "BRING ME 125 OF THEIR SKULL GEMS"
[2:33:49] <ABootlegPerson> parry is godlike in this game
[2:33:55] <Pillagius> This guy is like "Imma burd motherfluffer, IMMA BURD!"
[2:33:57] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> parry is POWERFUL
[2:34:02] <DazzlingFuhrer> Every day is riposte day.
[2:34:05] <CappuccinoGuil> There's your heal mechanic
[2:34:07] <%ThirdWelles> But do you parry with a chain whip?
[2:34:10] <%ThirdWelles> Because that's cool
[2:34:11] <LunarRemix> This is interesting
[2:34:13] <%ThirdWelles> oh
[2:34:15] <%Cuddl3F1st> parry is heals
[2:34:16] <%ThirdWelles> That's fucking lame
[2:34:22] <$RealThiele> a harden
[2:34:23] <wasdsf> well there's your zapping system right there
[2:34:24] <otakon17> you have an outright block
[2:34:25] <BoxNavy> a armor
[2:34:26] <otakon17> and a parry
[2:34:29] <Djinnazz> little tricky to use.
[2:34:31] <scrumbotime> you have Parry, Super Parry for Heal, or Rock for surity
[2:34:43] <CappuccinoGuil> YAAAAAAY
[2:34:48] <Borkbiff > It's Jago's stage in here

[2:36:12] <+enternius> Cats have a rumble aura
[2:36:14] <$RealThiele> budget into cat design
[2:36:14] <%vivaldiva> all the money into cat rumble
[2:36:14] <Borkbiff > All is forgiven!
[2:36:15] <LunarRemix> Is this the best souls game?
[2:36:16] <%Mendin> Haptic Cat Purr Technology
[2:36:16] <KaiGoesMoo> Haptic cat feedback
[2:36:19] <+OhioNitsud> haptic purrback
[2:36:19] <CappuccinoGuil> I think they did cover this, but the PS5 wasn't out yet
[2:36:20] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Lick butt hole
[2:36:23] <+strangemuon> I will now buy your game.
[2:36:25] <otakon17> I think it's been on there
[2:36:25] <dizimous> Bro I want a ps5 :( :( :( :(
[2:36:27] <Tooniearcade> Cat tech
[2:36:28] <%Mendin> Today -is- fridays!
[2:36:31] <%arcielardor> saw a speedrunner beat this without picking up a single she'll and with some kind of broadsword.
[2:36:36] <Zombrocom> More effort went into the cat purring than the character animations
[2:36:36] <+MelodyMedley> Swampy firelink doesn't seem too bad
[2:36:36] <%Ironbuttz> looks like this has a lot of potential
[2:36:36] <%hrbeck_> This is the future of gaming
[2:36:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Now go explore
[2:36:38] <+CateHecate> this seems jank but kind of cool. way cooler than lords of the fallen, i guess
[2:36:45] <MacMog> better than dynamic horse testes
[2:36:48] <%Cuddl3F1st> this game is a giant circle with branches
[2:36:48] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I jsut hear the constant didjeridu
[2:36:51] <+hakma> @arcielardor Happy hob?
[2:37:01] <%RyTYoung> @c0baltcrusade It's harden mechanic is pretty dope
[2:37:03] <Djinnazz> @arcielardor Yeah, you don't have to have a shell.
[2:37:09] <%Cuddl3F1st> this game has a good layout, everything connected with a few diverging paths
[2:37:16] <%arcielardor> I forget who, it was on GDQ
[2:37:17] <$RealThiele> k
[2:37:30] <+HalcyonNineThousand> can you "VERY GOOD" tho?
[2:37:36] <+CateHecate> i dont know why but aesthetically this reminds me most of like, Blasphemous, more than any other souls-like
[2:37:37] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:37:38] <otakon17> so Pat, what devil did you make a deal with to get that PS5?
[2:37:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Water Broken Hideout
[2:37:43] <otakon17> and this looks like a boss
[2:37:43] <+marlborored5> is that just a bloodborne rune on the left corner?
[2:37:44] <+MelodyMedley> Grisha?
[2:37:48] <+enternius> This guy's animations are a trainwreck
[2:37:49] <$RealThiele> Rat ogre

[2:38:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Grisha? Grisha Yaeger?
[2:38:42] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> red-flash means NO
[2:38:45] <+HalcyonNineThousand> i thought this was monster hunter and was very confused
[2:38:49] <%Cuddl3F1st> the flash is SEKIRO DANGER
[2:38:51] <Djinnazz> flashes when UNparryable
[2:38:51] <ABootlegPerson> parry is mostly for human enemies
[2:38:54] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yellow-flash means GO
[2:38:54] <+Cerabret100> thats how it warns unparry-able
[2:38:54] <+enternius> Yeah it should mean you SHOULD parry
[2:38:56] <Zombrocom> That does seem confusing
[2:38:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Nexial Binding: get
[2:39:02] <tanarath> Red mean stop
[2:39:05] <$RealThiele> dark sign
[2:39:07] <+HalcyonNineThousand> is this fromsoft?
[2:39:14] <%Cuddl3F1st> its a sekiro mechanic, danger dodge
[2:39:30] <HarmlessCrow> You can tell a lot about a person based on what they call this kind of item
[2:39:31] <+CateHecate> DIVINE TAR
[2:39:35] <Gamer76255> Big claws beat rock
[2:39:35] <Jaysky> @halcyonninethousand No this is From Hard
[2:39:41] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah, it's like that red flash from Sekiro isn't it?
[2:39:56] <MacMog> the shells should work like Killer 7 personas
[2:40:01] <%Cuddl3F1st> his normals are totally parriable tho
[2:40:04] <+HalcyonNineThousand> @Jaysky i like that. that was good
[2:40:07] <KaiserMario> I understand this game is going for a certain aesthetic, but I think it would benefit greatly if it had some color...
[2:40:13] <tanarath> And you got command grabbed
[2:40:14] <%Cuddl3F1st> you need resolve
[2:40:21] <BoxNavy> oof
[2:40:22] <%Cuddl3F1st> you get resolve by fighting
[2:40:24] <Jaysky> jayskyChaika
[2:40:31] <%Cuddl3F1st> yellow pips above hp bar
[2:40:33] <ExpressNode> That's some heavy tracking
[2:40:34] <+enternius> Stock bear roar
[2:40:38] <Zombrocom> Parry costs meter, it seems
[2:40:41] <Parapattern> Man that is some small damage
[2:41:01] <BoxNavy> i love the stock bear noises
[2:41:03] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> 4
[2:41:04] <WanderingYoren> you can always parry, except for the red ones, but you need at least one resolve pip to rirposte
[2:41:04] <%DappercatEsquire> punked
[2:41:07] <BlackStarAura> knife its asshole
[2:41:09] <$TallYoda08> LUL wow

[2:41:12] <+OhioNitsud> god that no look elbow
[2:41:20] <%slimmixrp> I like this game
[2:41:20] <tanarath> It can stone too, nice
[2:41:26] <ABootlegPerson> that chest IS worth getting
[2:41:27] <%ThirdWelles> what the fuck is that death screen?
[2:41:31] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> fight him without the shell, with unlimited stamina
[2:41:33] <rafaelba93> its hard but doable
[2:41:33] <%ThirdWelles> That was completely illegible
[2:41:35] <+tigerfang86> but what if we KEPT DYING
[2:41:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah
[2:41:38] <+tigerfang86> until we WIN
[2:41:39] <%slimmixrp> I wish it didn't start you in a shitty swamp though. A little slow to get rolling
[2:41:40] <T_Sasquatch> !Uptime
[2:41:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 42m.
[2:41:43] <+enternius> I think this boss gives you a new body
[2:41:52] <+jepupu> Taht death screen looks like a some black metal band's logo
[2:42:01] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> gives you new tech, not new body
[2:42:01] <%slimmixrp> Max did the same thing lol
[2:42:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Roll, this isn't Poise
[2:42:24] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> 5

[2:42:34] <BoxNavy> yee
[2:42:35] <%Cuddl3F1st> yes
[2:42:35] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yes
[2:42:35] <ABootlegPerson> maybe
[2:42:36] <Djinnazz> yeah
[2:42:40] <+enternius> Can't hurt to try
[2:42:41] <%ThirdWelles> I can't fucking read that
[2:42:43] <Reanimator83> I thought Pat played this when it came. Guess I was wrong
[2:42:44] <tanarath> find out, Pat.
[2:42:47] <ABootlegPerson> the animation is pretty long i think
[2:42:48] <WanderingYoren> yes but then you wouldn't learn
[2:42:48] <EuropanLamprey> M O R T I S
[2:42:55] <+MelodyMedley> Give it a try
[2:42:57] <%Agami23> its not tuesday so no
[2:42:57] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> fuck around
[2:42:58] <Seancicle> 👋🏻
[2:42:59] <%ThirdWelles> only if you grab it first
[2:42:59] <ChoculaUltra> the ol twist n tug
[2:43:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah Pat Fuck around and Find out
[2:43:03] <HarmlessCrow> DICK TWIST TUESDAYS
[2:43:03] <$mysterypork> Fuck around and find out Pat
[2:43:03] <Sternieliscious> Try to hurt him emotionally.
[2:43:06] <Parapattern> He's gonna pull your dick inside out
[2:43:15] <alphonseisbest> DICK TWIST (UNREAL)
[2:43:17] <rosencruez> the ol dick twist
[2:43:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yeeeees
[2:43:24] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> now run it back
[2:43:25] <+HalcyonNineThousand> if it was a mimic i wouldve shit
[2:43:25] <%Cuddl3F1st> that thing is disgusting
[2:43:30] <ABootlegPerson> upgrade your weapon with that
[2:43:30] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> spike is gooood
[2:43:33] <ABootlegPerson> i think
[2:43:42] <HarmlessCrow> Yo his dick just got twisted good
[2:43:43] <%Cuddl3F1st> spend meter for IMPALEMENT
[2:43:57] <+HeroSolaire> This game looks so clunky
[2:44:03] <%Cuddl3F1st> he does stagger with enough damage
[2:44:09] <Parapattern> He's just a big hairy Baraka
[2:44:17] <otakon17> he needs to parry him
[2:44:23] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Fun thing about this game, some boss rooms have more than one entrance.
[2:44:23] <+MelodyMedley> He seems pretty predictable at least
[2:44:23] <$Dakuu75> wow, this guy is NO joke
[2:44:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I believe that you can win
[2:44:25] <%Agami23> huh. theres no fog gate.
[2:44:35] <%ThirdWelles> Grab his sleeve and Harden it
[2:44:35] <%Agami23> i wonder if that means you can lure him out into the bear traps
[2:44:40] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I beat this game with 0 parries, you don't need to parry
[2:44:46] <otakon17> sadly no
[2:44:49] <%Cuddl3F1st> spike his asshole real good
[2:44:55] <otakon17> you CAN run from the fight I think though?
[2:44:56] <%ThirdWelles> I hope it spikes mechanically
[2:45:00] <+enternius> Workbench upstairs
[2:45:01] <%Cuddl3F1st> weapon upgrade
[2:45:05] <$Dakuu75> why does she keep offering you a bunch of random shit?
[2:45:05] <$floralkami> oh, we freshly passed the first half of this area?
[2:45:06] <BlackStarAura> Jesus, why did I think this game had the backstabbing mechanic
[2:45:08] <+Shacklebox> When Factorio?
[2:45:08] <%Cuddl3F1st> go to workbench
[2:45:18] <HarmlessCrow> Why no drink tar
[2:45:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Roll is first Option, Harden is more of a parry than a shield it seems
[2:45:34] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> might as well use this guy as fighting practice because you ARE eventually going to hit a fight you can't back out on
[2:45:39] <$floralkami> how long we been playing this game, chat m
[2:45:40] <%Cuddl3F1st> spend meter for invincible damage
[2:45:42] <+HeroSolaire> The gameplay feels better than it looks? or is it also slow?
[2:45:44] <BoxNavy> yo
[2:45:44] <ABootlegPerson> it's an EX move
[2:45:46] <Djinnazz> sweet!
[2:45:47] <+MelodyMedley> Cool!
[2:45:47] <BoxNavy> that was awesome
[2:45:47] <Brofarian> Yo
[2:45:50] <%Cuddl3F1st> you get invincibilty on that
[2:45:52] <Visorak6> Yo thats rad
[2:45:53] <%ThirdWelles> YO
[2:45:54] <+jepupu> Spikey.
[2:45:54] <doublemasteramerica> Gotta admit that's rad
[2:45:54] <$Dakuu75> that's borderline a trick weapon. sword/spear
[2:45:56] <+enternius> The gameplay actually feels worse than it looks
[2:45:57] <%Piemen99> sweet animation
[2:45:57] <%ThirdWelles> THAT'S RAD AS HELL
[2:45:58] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> like saved game locked in a room with a boss, can't get out until you win, kind of fight
[2:45:59] <Seancicle> 🙊
[2:46:01] <+Shacklebox> do it again!
[2:46:05] <LoreKeeper_Thal> this game be looking way better since i last saw it, goshdang
[2:46:11] <tanarath> Now give him the 'ol dick twist
[2:46:11] <Sternieliscious> Truly you are now the Pokey-Man.
[2:46:14] <%ThirdWelles> Okay the mediocrity of this game is beginning to fade. I'm curious now.
[2:46:15] <ABootlegPerson> the whole animation is invul
[2:46:16] <%Cuddl3F1st> YEYEYE
[2:46:16] <LunarRemix> I like that this game doesn't play completely safe with it's gimmicks
[2:46:19] <+MelodyMedley> Niice
[2:46:20] <$Dakuu75> he HATES it
[2:46:24] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i-frames on the windup I think too
[2:46:33] <Pookiedaexzile> AND IT STAGGERS HIM
[2:46:34] <%ThirdWelles> okay that seems important
[2:46:34] <Gamer76255> Guaranteed  stun too
[2:46:42] <$floralkami> he hit you with that frame trap
[2:46:46] <+MelodyMedley> I wasn't completely sure on this game at first but I'm coming around on it
[2:46:48] <%Cuddl3F1st> you get back meter quick, spam your shit
[2:46:54] <+enternius> LUL
[2:46:55] <$floralkami> LUL
[2:46:55] <+Opal_Overture> @Shacklebox God, I hope it's soon, Been hit with a haaaard factorio kick and, after seeing pat connect with Satisfactory, I need to see him try The Good Shit too
[2:47:10] <wangarudesaru> Innovative game Kappa
[2:47:15] <$floralkami> I really like the ragdoll in this game for the char
[2:47:26] <ABootlegPerson> yeah dodge has crazy invul
[2:47:27] <%Mendin> I wanna see Pat mess with nuclear reactors in the upcoming satisfactory update
[2:47:29] <+HalcyonNineThousand> isnt there like a charge up parry move?
[2:47:30] <Cuddl3F1st> ignore the "but what if i need it later?" goblins, your meter comes back quick
[2:47:33] <$Dakuu75> 1/3rd
[2:47:34] <Sotetsu> Is Pat enjoying this game?
[2:47:37] <$floralkami> you really feel that "AH, FUCK" when you get hit
[2:47:42] <%ThirdWelles> You need to be [HARDENING] more, methinks
[2:47:43] <+MelodyMedley> Doing good Pat
[2:47:43] <BoxNavy> no
[2:47:43] <$realm_forge> Anyone else hear the public domain hear sound fx?
[2:47:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Innovation is for cowards
[2:47:46] <tanarath> Oneutwo, one-two
[2:47:49] <$realm_forge> Bear
[2:47:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Persist
[2:47:52] <ExpressNode> Euro Jank
[2:47:54] <%Cuddl3F1st> it's a good jank
[2:47:59] <%Metballs> Good jank?
[2:48:01] <LoudmicRPG> How come its jank?
[2:48:02] <%ClericOfSparda> This looks like a shitty interpretation of "Dark Souls remade in Unreal Engine"
[2:48:02] <+luftraumm1> there is something here
[2:48:03] <%Metballs> Cool
[2:48:05] <+MelodyMedley> There's something here
[2:48:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Souls is Jank
[2:48:06] <+strangemuon> So was DS1.
[2:48:06] <LoudmicRPG> Whats jank about it
[2:48:06] <$Dakuu75> ashen one~
[2:48:07] <%ThirdWelles> seems to be a fun jank
[2:48:08] <%Cuddl3F1st> wait until you get the other classes
[2:48:09] <tanarath> It's got new/odd cool stuff
[2:48:10] <Cymen90> Dark Souls 1 was pretty jank too
[2:48:11] <%RyTYoung> FUN JANK
[2:48:13] <marvel877> Good jank or bad jank?
[2:48:14] <+BettyMwwaahh> that describes ALL souls-likes
[2:48:15] <BoxNavy> i mean jank isnt automatically bad. look at no more heroes
[2:48:17] <wangarudesaru> So is every game dark souls now?
[2:48:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Souls has always been Jank
[2:48:19] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> it feels jank, the mid-string block brings back some fluidity
[2:48:23] <$floralkami> @clericofsparda I'm pretty sure it was made in Unreal
[2:48:29] <+OhioNitsud> whats it mean when his seal turns red?
[2:48:32] <%ThirdWelles> I gave up on the idea of it after Otzdarva's full playthrough lasted like 4 and a half hours
[2:48:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Name a Souls game that isn't Jank
[2:48:38] <%ClericOfSparda> @floralkami LUL
[2:48:40] <$floralkami> @marvel877 considering there's something there, probably good
[2:48:41] <ABootlegPerson> you can harden after a dodge
[2:48:43] <%RyTYoung> one of the first things I did was kill this dude, it can be done
[2:48:44] <+kullumanati> Let’s go Orb!!!!!!!
[2:48:45] <%ThirdWelles> Figured it wasn't worth it
[2:48:47] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @OhioNitsud red means unblockable incoming
[2:48:56] <Cymen90> @wangarudesaru It is a genre now, so get used to it.
[2:48:59] <+OhioNitsud> ah ok thanks
[2:48:59] <%Cuddl3F1st> it feels really janky at first, but once you "get in" it feels great
[2:49:03] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> unparryable*
[2:49:08] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt more or less jank than Outriders?
[2:49:18] <%Cuddl3F1st> dont forget to try parry on normals
[2:49:27] <Agami23> this game gives a weird feeling.
[2:49:32] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> the parry is super tight. I can never land it
[2:49:47] <+MelodyMedley> There's a parry!
[2:49:49] <%Cuddl3F1st> YEAH
[2:49:50] <+mf_doomfist98> This game has such a strange tone and I love it
[2:49:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> PogChamp
[2:49:54] <tanarath> parry
[2:49:56] <%ThirdWelles> Nice
[2:49:58] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> some other bosses have very obvious timing for parry, so I guess fuck around and find out which ones you can land easy
[2:50:01] <%Cuddl3F1st> PARRY IS GODLIKE IN THIS ONE
[2:50:04] <%StrawberryPantsu> ROAAAAAAAAAAAR
[2:50:15] <%ThirdWelles> MECHANICAL
[2:50:17] <BoxNavy> oh shit
[2:50:18] <%ThirdWelles> SPOIKE
[2:50:18] <%Cuddl3F1st> YEAH YEAH
[2:50:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> gottem!
[2:50:22] <BoxNavy> now hes gettin it
[2:50:22] <wangarudesaru> @cymen90 really shouldn’t be
[2:50:25] <+MelodyMedley> YEAH
[2:50:33] <DazzlingFuhrer> those wonky bear noises
[2:50:34] <%Mendin> SHIBOBI DEATHBLOW?
[2:50:35] <$floralkami> RRRRRRAAAAAOOOooaaRRRAAAOOORRrrRRRA
[2:50:44] <%Ziegsy> Not to get real here but anyone else here because they're feeling lonely and this is the closest thing to hanging out with friends we have at the moment?
[2:50:48] <Cymen90> @wangarudesaru What? It shouldn't be a genre? Why is that?
[2:50:49] <Sternieliscious> Grrraaaaar!
[2:50:50] <Seancicle> All the scalies are asking, what's it like in there❓
[2:50:55] <SwindlerOfProgress> That bear noise plays too often LUL
[2:50:59] <+MelodyMedley> So it's a shinobi deathblow type of parry
[2:51:02] <MacMog> @ziegsy little bit
[2:51:03] <%Cuddl3F1st> you can harden while swinging and the damage will  still come out while invincible
[2:51:10] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @Ziegsy that's why I live here
[2:51:11] <%Mendin> @Ziegsy Look  up "Parasocial Relationship" but also yeah
[2:51:13] <Djinnazz> so xclose
[2:51:13] <BoxNavy> the choke jermaPluto
[2:51:14] <+luftraumm1> @ziegsy that's about it
[2:51:14] <+enternius> Jebaited
[2:51:14] <+HalcyonNineThousand> welcome in grisha
[2:51:15] <+MelodyMedley> So close
[2:51:16] <Cymen90> You. Did not do it.
[2:51:16] <Pookiedaexzile> This is this weird middle ground of Darksouls  and  Bloodborne
[2:51:16] <+OhioNitsud> ah so close
[2:51:18] <$floralkami> damn, so close
[2:51:19] <R3c0n31> So close
[2:51:20] <+Kharinite> you getting there
[2:51:21] <+jepupu> Got overconfident
[2:51:22] <%Cuddl3F1st> you got this!
[2:51:24] <+Kharinite> one more time
[2:51:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Also don't forget the spike
[2:51:25] <%ThirdWelles> Which one of you fucks just jinxed it
[2:51:30] <%Cuddl3F1st> WHAT DID I SAY.
[2:51:30] <tanarath> Pat, Parry the attacks you can parry
[2:51:33] <%Mendin> @Pookiedaexzile I thought that was called DS3
[2:51:35] <%Movemeister> @Ziegsy pretty much
[2:51:36] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah mech spike, brother
[2:51:36] <Tuna_Can_0> were we the moral shell all along?
[2:51:37] <%W1nterTitan> damn so close. Impressive either way
[2:51:39] <$floralkami> @ziegsy yeah...
[2:51:42] <%ThirdWelles> You forgot after the first one
[2:51:43] <+xiccy> Drink Tar\
[2:51:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Damn, I stepped away for a bit and Pat is still on this boss. So it's hard huh?
[2:51:49] <pmda2126> it is a good parry indeed
[2:51:50] <%blaccbird914> I may pick this up today I ve been looking for some good jank
[2:51:51] <+MelodyMedley> Grisha!
[2:51:56] <%Cuddl3F1st> spend that meter
[2:52:01] <$Dakuu75> "prasocial relationships" lol that's dark
[2:52:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> defeat knife bear
[2:52:23] <%ThirdWelles> Para
[2:52:28] <MacMog> bear off the tarboard bow!
[2:52:29] <%Ziegsy> good to see Im not alone
[2:52:30] <%coward_man> that thing is making some Doom imp noises
[2:52:30] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this game's got the right amount of jank for interesting speedruns
[2:52:39] <%Mendin> @Dakuu75 Yeah but it explains a lot about streamers' more weirdass fans
[2:52:40] <%Cuddl3F1st> harden isn't block, harden is hyper armor. think of it like that
[2:52:41] <+MelodyMedley> Those bear knives have big range
[2:52:44] <tanarath> that's a three combo & it's a charge
[2:52:46] <ConfusedCultist> This is on epic games only right?
[2:52:55] <Tuna_Can_0> harden Kreygasm
[2:52:55] <Seancicle> I always think I'm out of range HA↗️HA↘️HA↙️HA↗️
[2:53:01] <$Dakuu75> @Mendin for sure
[2:53:01] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> it's on ps5 now
[2:53:09] <+MelodyMedley> Oh damn
[2:53:10] <Cymen90> M O R T I S
[2:53:12] <$floralkami> GET COMMAND GRABBED
[2:53:12] <+Kharinite> jeez
[2:53:12] <%ThirdWelles> Whoah
[2:53:13] <$Dakuu75> fucking Barraka fatality
[2:53:18] <%ThirdWelles> I didn't expect that
[2:53:19] <%Ziegsy> I mean its not completely parasocial, Im chatting to you guys
[2:53:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @ConfusedCultist On PC, yes
[2:53:25] <+xiccy> Drink Tar
[2:53:26] <%ThirdWelles> Mechanical spike
[2:53:31] <%Cuddl3F1st> yes
[2:53:34] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> shell while mid-heavy
[2:53:42] <ConfusedCultist> @CappuccinoGuil Gotcha, thanks!
[2:53:48] <%Cuddl3F1st> shell just before the swing lands and you'll still deal damage
[2:53:51] <+enternius> @ThirdWelles The spike takes the same gauge as the parry I think
[2:53:54] <$floralkami> @ziegsy yeah that was an overstatement
[2:53:56] <+MelodyMedley> So you have both a super armour and a parry in this game huh
[2:54:06] <%ThirdWelles> Oh it does? Shit nvm
[2:54:07] <$Dakuu75> he's fucking swinging the sword by the blade, to hit with the hilt. wtf kind of shit is that?! lmao
[2:54:14] <%Ziegsy> NGL that hardening sound is super satisfying#
[2:54:17] <+nekodelic> doesn't the hitbox stay active when you shell?
[2:54:20] <BoxNavy> the shell seems like a get outta jail free card more than a standard block
[2:54:25] <MacMog> gut the bear like a fish!
[2:54:31] <%Cuddl3F1st> metal gauntlets?j
[2:54:38] <+nekodelic> @Dakuu75 it's called half-swording
[2:54:40] <CappuccinoGuil> This game is right there between DS and Sekiro. It's not an RPG, it's a character action game.
[2:54:41] <%rkbinder> Parry more
[2:54:46] <$floralkami> @dakuu75 some hype shit I wanna see more of
[2:54:51] <ConfusedCultist> NGL I think this game would be fantastic if it had a bigger team and more time to polish
[2:55:07] <ABootlegPerson> now that's some jank
[2:55:10] <%Cuddl3F1st> YEYE
[2:55:15] <tanarath> Good parry, Pat
[2:55:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ConfusedCultist I mean you can say that about basically every game lmao
[2:55:32] <$floralkami> @nekodelic I don't think that's half-swording in particular, tho
[2:55:35] <%ThirdWelles> oh okay so the parry itself is free, but the followup costs meter
[2:55:58] <%Cuddl3F1st> parry does cost meter
[2:56:04] <+MelodyMedley> You got it this time
[2:56:09] <$floralkami> @nekodelic half-swording is more like holding the sword in a way to use it like a lance
[2:56:11] <%Cuddl3F1st> so you dont constantly spam  it
[2:56:11] <+MelodyMedley> I like that parry
[2:56:18] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:56:34] <+MelodyMedley> Don't forget about the spike move
[2:56:35] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap ok
[2:56:35] <wangarudesaru> @cymen90 how is this different to any other from the genre? Is there literally anything gameplay wise or thematically different. Or is it a case of, the darks souls series was good, this is like dark souls, I guess I’ll play it  to scratch the itch
[2:56:39] <ConfusedCultist> @ReallyBigRocks You say that, but I don't think there's any saving for Beyond Two Souls confus33Lol
[2:56:39] <MacMog> Heartstopper
[2:56:42] <$floralkami> or a spear
[2:56:46] <BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:56:50] <BoxNavy> OH SHIT
[2:56:51] <doublemasteramerica> Big oof
[2:56:52] <+MelodyMedley> You can still do it!
[2:56:58] <RyderTiliqua> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:57:04] <$floralkami> TOO CLOSE MON, TOO CLOSE
[2:57:06] <+nekodelic> @floralkami that's true, just googled it and it's called Mordhau
[2:57:06] <MacMog> no panic
[2:57:06] <%RyTYoung> CMON
[2:57:14] <%RyTYoung> YE
[2:57:15] <BoxNavy> YES
[2:57:15] <+HalcyonNineThousand> this gundyr 2.0 is much better than the last one
[2:57:16] <%Cuddl3F1st> F
[2:57:16] <pmda2126> finish
[2:57:16] <+enternius> KomodoHype
[2:57:17] <ConfusedCultist> Good shit!

[2:58:36] <wangarudesaru> So glimpses are souls then MrDestructoid
[2:58:40] <Cymen90> @wangarudesaru So Doom should not have become a genre, either? I guess Wolfenstein only exists to scratch the same itch? I do not get your argument. This series innovated and now many games are using the mechanics that it popularized. Soulslike is a genre now, get over it.
[2:58:41] <$floralkami> I really like this armor design, idk why. something about the leather body makes it look a lot more viable as something you could run and move in. BRUH WHAT WAS THAT???
[2:58:41] <%W1nterTitan> omg im dyinhg
[2:58:42] <%ThirdWelles> Mediocrity be praised

[3:09:08] <+Cerabret100> @Deekman these dogs don't exist naturally and kind of shouldn't because of how many problems they have
[3:09:09] <+beardedjho> These dont seem like a viable dog breed then
[3:09:09] <BoxNavy> hes had enough
[3:09:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sounds like a shitty dog to breed LUL

[3:09:28] <ChoculaUltra> while it makes perfect sense, I had not previously thought of the intricacies that go into slime/goo management amongst pupperinos

[3:09:38] <%coward_man> you know he's upset if he does a for real bark
[3:09:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's so fucked up how we humans have bred dogs to be certain things to the detriment of the dog's health. But he cute tho
[3:09:40] <%YakumoYomi> My girl had a yeast infection recently. It was a struggle to get her to take those pills twice a day
[3:09:44] <parkslady> omg big babby tantrums

[3:09:49] <dimensaur> there's a zoner up there
[3:09:51] <%asgard147> or a teenager even
[3:09:53] <ExpressNode> My dog gets tantrums whenever we have to apply the flea repellant
[3:09:59] <tanarath> I'd try to breed in traits that make him less of a tortured being

[3:10:31] <MeMillionthDollar> weapons are independent from shells

[3:10:47] <dimensaur> this dude is beefier i think
[3:10:52] <%heartlesshealer> how is the shell of mortals so far? Is there fashion?
[3:10:55] <+Cyborc> is this a soulslike?
[3:10:55] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> go back to the swamp hub

[3:11:08] <ChoculaUltra> MAX resolve.
[3:11:09] <Cymen90> MAX RESOLVE
[3:11:13] <MeMillionthDollar> You need a usable item to change shells (depending on shell) or go back to maiden lady room to change
[3:11:17] <tanarath> BIG resolve
[3:11:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's with all the tunnels?
[3:11:19] <+MelodyMedley> Different skills?
[3:11:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> BIG RESOLVE
[3:11:23] <ABootlegPerson> you use a consumable item to changes shells on the fly
[3:11:24] <+queaks> Ive been binging satisfactory organisation tutorials...

[3:11:32] <%Cuddl3F1st> and it's one time use
[3:11:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Ugh, the white flash every time you open the menu is awful
[3:11:43] <Reanimator83> second shell is better

[3:11:50] <%za7az> @YakumoYomi I know, the phrasing was just too good to not make the joke LUL
[3:11:53] <Sol_Install> oh really? nice
[3:11:53] <huskarl_zap> lol
[3:11:54] <wangarudesaru> @cymen90 what’s the scope of gameplay like in this genre ?
[3:11:55] <%Cuddl3F1st> "good jank"
[3:12:00] <+MelodyMedley> Big resolve
[3:12:01] <+enternius> Unfortunately it's front-loaded with the cool ideas
[3:12:04] <+dinonick79> Whats jank about it?
[3:12:04] <ABootlegPerson> this game has a really strong atmosphere
[3:12:04] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsuspectd blunt?
[3:12:05] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[3:12:06] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt what's the closest souls game it feels like?
[3:12:07] <+queaks> Only one weapon so far?
[3:12:07] <tanarath> Souls is jank, though
[3:12:08] <ConfusedCultist> I've been raring to play this as well but I don't give money to Epic
[3:12:10] <MeMillionthDollar> sip this shit
[3:12:10] <BoxNavy> sip this
[3:12:11] <Grimsever88> hows the level design?
[3:12:12] <+enternius> It's short and still manages to drag near the end
[3:12:13] <+jepupu> From Software is kinda jank too though.
[3:12:16] <%rkbinder> the secret ending is the best
[3:12:23] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> no it's cool throughout but it's short so w/e
[3:12:24] <BoxNavy> sip this paint thinner
[3:12:24] <%Cuddl3F1st> save your tar and glimps items for a skill you want
[3:12:25] <%king_wragles> I love him already
[3:12:29] <Visorak6> The best we can hope for is the game does well enough the team can be better funded to make a more fleshed out sequel
[3:12:29] <MacMog> Friendly rating with Tattered Robe: neutral
[3:12:30] <+LastHazzerd> the voice acting is great
[3:12:31] <$Dakuu75> The voice acting is good though.

[3:12:41] <%UvBenServed> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[3:12:45] <ExpressNode> Oh hey they actually put some Bethesda stuff for Game Pass
[3:12:47] <Xiangchang> "Welcome back, to the stage of history".
[3:12:49] <%Mendin> He'll do the pull-out
[3:12:53] <tanarath> @queaks He found 3 others, but he hasn't unlocked them
[3:12:54] <%Deekman> need more TAR
[3:12:56] <MeMillionthDollar> Smort man
[3:12:56] <MacMog> do you daily Tattered Robe quests to level reputation
[3:12:57] <%Deft_Thought> I think the hardening mechanic is a dope idea. Being able to give yourself super armor is neat
[3:12:58] <Zombrocom> Ok but what chance though
[3:12:59] <%Cuddl3F1st> air harden is meh
[3:13:11] <tanarath> Hammer & chisel, big weapon, and one other
[3:13:16] <+MelodyMedley> Solomon!
[3:13:18] <BoxNavy> BoxNavy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:13:22] <%Deft_Thought> So Shell's are more like Sekiro stances?
[3:13:22] <ABootlegPerson> regain last chance is very useful when exploring
[3:13:31] <$Dakuu75> So each shell is a different skill-tree?
[3:13:34] <MeMillionthDollar> To change your shell you can go to the wall indents in that room fyi
[3:13:39] <%Cuddl3F1st> wait until you find BIG BOY
[3:13:42] <ConfusedCultist> Hall Wugging time
[3:13:42] <BurningWigEmissary> owo its raining here in California its crazy
[3:13:46] <%BoxNavy> time for funneling
[3:13:59] <%heartlesshealer> that's pretty cool, Dollar
[3:14:05] <ABootlegPerson> yeah each shell has different abilities, except for the 3 abilities at the bottom
[3:14:08] <%Deekman> why harden and not just parry?
[3:14:10] <+MelodyMedley> Interesting
[3:14:13] <BurningWigEmissary> I want elden ring already
[3:14:14] <%Cuddl3F1st> do you plan to play this all the way through?

[3:15:11] <$Dakuu75> the fucking lute keeps twanging when ppl walk into it
[3:15:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does having big resolve make you stay hard longer?
[3:15:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> lmao
[3:15:15] <%Cuddl3F1st> resolve is meter
[3:15:20] <+twohitgood> is the rock mechanic like a substitute for a shield?
[3:15:29] <MeMillionthDollar> I wish i could wield my swords by the tip
[3:15:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wah
[3:15:44] <ConfusedCultist> @Cerabret100 Gotcha so more resolve=more use of skills

[3:18:19] <+LordAngry> Rick and Mortis
[3:18:20] <pmda2126> I like the bad played note before battle
[3:18:20] <smuggleruncle> some of the boss cut-scenes in this are comedy gold, you'll see when he gets there
[3:18:21] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> might try sprinting past all those guys
[3:18:22] <CrazyMedicine> They killed music man
[3:18:25] <Radioactivetaco9> enemies gather around to listen to music makes them feel strangly human and it makes me feel uncomfterable killing them
[3:18:29] <MeMillionthDollar> @ReallyBigRocks YEs you can... you get better at playing the lute each time you play it
[3:18:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Mortis Joe
[3:18:41] <+dinonick79> You should try that way again
[3:18:43] <MeMillionthDollar> Eventually you can shred! @ReallyBigRocks
[3:18:56] <waywardhavoc> but their music taste is not the same as yours so kill them
[3:18:57] <%Cuddl3F1st> they ARE human, you're the asshole in this case
[3:19:04] <+dinonick79> Weird they all know the same song though
[3:19:08] <%vivaldiva> reminds me of STALKER a little
[3:19:08] <Brofarian> plot twist: you're the hollow
[3:19:12] <+Aldurin_> is this not how Florida Man works?
[3:19:16] <+MelodyMedley> They're just playing music in their camps
[3:19:25] <+chiazam> Idk why but this combat always looked REALLY clunky
[3:19:27] <dizimous> Musicians all deserve to die
[3:19:28] <Pookiedaexzile> yeah they still make hacking monster noises
[3:19:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> @MeMillionthDollar I know that, but is there some kind of mechanic with playing near them?
[3:19:32] <Brofarian> actually aren't you literally a body snapping ghost zombie?
[3:19:33] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta get real hard in this game
[3:19:42] <%dekkitout> You ever have to just deck a mfkr upside the head for interrupting your tunes?
[3:19:46] <EvolNom> Pat I just wanted to thank you for the amazing podcast and Gief is awesome
[3:19:59] <MeMillionthDollar> @ReallyBigRocks Ah! Unfortunately I dont believe so lol that would be cool though!
[3:20:00] <ConfusedCultist> I just realized this is the one game in which being a metapod is top tier
[3:20:03] <MeMillionthDollar> like charming them or something

[3:21:28] <segychan> @PatStaresAt Will there be a Satisfactory Stream?
[3:21:54] <brunoberserk> so i hearded  this game is super short , this is true ??
[3:21:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> @segychan He said on Twitter he's streaming it next week
[3:22:07] <segychan> woo
[3:22:08] <wasdsf> 15-20 hours
[3:22:12] <%DappercatEsquire> Curious about other weapons, wonder when a new one shows up
[3:22:20] <+MelodyMedley> Those guys seem useful for getting health back
[3:22:28] <%Cuddl3F1st> weapons are on each branch
[3:22:36] <$Dakuu75> YEP, a little JANK, lol
[3:22:39] <TheAngryArtist> a souls vet can tear through this game in 8-10 hours
[3:22:41] <Brofarian> you can do it bud
[3:22:48] <odnucaf3> it looks so bland and yanky.
[3:22:52] <+Shacklebox> haha he stuck
[3:22:55] <+saltyvest> Unethically sourced kills D:
[3:22:59] <TheAngryArtist> only three zones
[3:23:00] <+MelodyMedley> Getting some good tar
[3:23:05] <%Cuddl3F1st> it gets fucking good when you get to the other areas
[3:23:05] <ConfusedCultist> Btw Pat you were hilarious in that warhammer video about Nurgle recently
[3:23:05] <+gitgouda> oh this looks so much better now that its released.
[3:23:06] <EvolNom> So this is Mortal shell?
[3:23:24] <wasdsf> this is monster hunter
[3:23:28] <EvolNom> Sounds like a crunchier dark souls
[3:23:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat's hatred of music even bleeds into video games
[3:23:38] <$Dakuu75> Is the parry timing generous?
[3:23:42] <%Cuddl3F1st> YES
[3:23:50] <Pookiedaexzile> So no more spike?
[3:24:02] <wangarudesaru> So what’s the equivalent of a bonfire then

[3:32:52] <+AtlasMcCoy> Is there no staggering in this game?
[3:32:53] <+SocialMisfitGamer> gotta do quick hardens, he'll attack the second you un-harden
[3:32:54] <%ThirdWelles> Is that a new shell? I haven't been around since the first one
[3:33:01] <Reanimator83> Kick his ass Sea Bass
[3:33:03] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Cheer Get em' Pat!
[3:33:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> That flying jump attack looks fuckin rad
[3:33:14] <%ThirdWelles> This seems very doable
[3:33:25] <supergoblinpunch> Jump and harden
[3:33:27] <+MelodyMedley> This is Pat's third shell
[3:33:27] <+AtlasMcCoy> THAT DAMAGE
[3:33:30] <+Rekinsinn> that dagger looks so annoying
[3:33:31] <tanarath> I love how the boss doesn't let up, but isn't unfair
[3:33:36] <+MelodyMedley> Very doable but tough
[3:33:36] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Can you harden against that leaping attack?
[3:33:40] <%dekkitout> "A man is more than just a sleeve" is a phrase I didn't expect to see but fits well on this stream
[3:33:42] <RyuuAoi> This is monster Hunter?
[3:33:42] <%W1nterTitan> Look at that huge fish!
[3:33:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Uhh, why don't you just get hit less and hit him more?
[3:33:57] <+TheOlMitcheroo> No, the boss is pretty unfair. He has moves that come out with 0 windup
[3:34:00] <%Broand> That shell pats using has boss esque health
[3:34:03] <+AtlasMcCoy> What
[3:34:15] <%Cuddl3F1st> he has a rotation
[3:34:20] <+kullumanati> Do the block block block and the hit hit hit.
[3:34:24] <%Cuddl3F1st> 0 windup but you know it's coming
[3:34:26] <+MelodyMedley> Big fish just chilling

[3:36:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at when he Hardens PAt
[3:36:22] <%KineticZen> Is this game just one giant dick joke
[3:36:24] <+MelodyMedley> The hardening is an interesting mechanic
[3:36:25] <%Cuddl3F1st> ...there's more than one...
[3:36:25] <+kullumanati> Become he is you
[3:36:33] <+dinonick79> Thank god someone else had troble with these guys. I thought I just sucked
[3:36:35] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah!
[3:36:36] <Emilia_Bright> nice
[3:36:52] <+samuraiknack> This is Dark Souls natural conclusion
[3:37:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally walked right into that one
[3:37:10] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @dinonick79 The other variations aren't bad, but this one has a lot of bullshit to deal with
[3:37:14] <ExpressNode> This feels like the dark link battle in ocarina of time. Even the endless water background
[3:37:23] <%Cuddl3F1st> YOU GOT THIS
[3:37:25] <Brofarian> yomi him Pat
[3:37:25] <%coward_man> don't react, predict
[3:37:35] <RyuuAoi> Okay Pat will win
[3:37:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> in this battle of hardness you have to pre
[3:37:46] <aura_00> the way he just walks toward you is so fucking menacing
[3:37:52] <+randymood> This looks kinda janky
[3:37:55] <@ShockzNDrawe> This water sounds like a load of wet gurgling farts
[3:37:57] <RyuuAoi> Pre cum is key
[3:38:22] <tanarath> @patstaresat Harden seems like a flat amount, maybe based on class.
[3:38:23] <Emilia_Bright> o he dead
[3:38:23] <+MelodyMedley> Nice
[3:38:26] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[3:38:29] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Hardening seems more viable than parrying

[3:39:01] <%RyderTiliqua> BALISTAZOOKA
[3:39:03] <+TheOlMitcheroo> The hammer and chisel is really cool tho

[3:39:07] <RyuuAoi> Ever
[3:39:09] <%Cuddl3F1st> NOW YOU GET THAT WEAPON
[3:39:10] <Visorak6> statue
[3:39:10] <%baronblank> what's the reward?
[3:39:11] <+dinonick79> To get the weapon you have to BEAT IT first. My fav concept in this game
[3:39:15] <%Piemono> I feel like the hit in the combo where the guy grabs his sword by the point of the blade is pretty stupid
[3:39:16] <%baronblank> ah
[3:39:20] <ExpressNode> Oh it gave you a new weapon
[3:39:21] <+MelodyMedley> Hammer and chisel!
[3:39:22] <%Deft_Thought> Only winners get eaten
[3:39:24] <%Cuddl3F1st> THAT DUMB SHIT HE DID? YOU GET THAT

[3:39:28] <Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:39:32] <%dekkitout> Now you have become the hadern
[3:39:33] <pmda2126> spinning lariat was good
[3:39:36] <Visorak6> Its the same moveset
[3:39:37] <%KineticZen> If you can't just stick the chisel into some guy and hammer it the fuck down I am disappoint
[3:39:38] <%Cuddl3F1st> yo gotta unlock it first
[3:39:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @dinonick79 wait, but I found the hammer and chisel myself on the level?
[3:39:42] <%coward_man> @Piemono that's real sword fighting technique dude
[3:39:48] <RyuuAoi> Summons Niddhog
[3:40:03] <%Cuddl3F1st> running attack has a small hitbox but its good
[3:40:03] <+kullumanati> Certain shells do better with specific weapons.
[3:40:15] <goose_tech> sesters?
[3:40:18] <%BinaryFireball> so is this game good now?
[3:40:22] <%Cuddl3F1st> big boy likes big weapons
[3:40:24] <%Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! Hey pat. Was just looking at the ever crisis trailer again and was wondering what your feelings were about cissnei and her chances of making it in to remake now that weiss is confirmed
[3:40:27] <Djinnazz> trial and error
[3:40:33] <%Piemono> @coward_man I know that's something that was done, but was it done mid swing like that?
[3:40:34] <tanarath> @piemono check out halfswording videos, it's dope
[3:40:39] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @goose_tech Sisters
[3:40:43] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt i mean, a heavy auto attack weapon would do better with someone with a lot of stamina
[3:40:43] <Cymen90> brethers and sesters.
[3:40:44] <Visorak6> Wait dont you want to identify him?
[3:40:47] <%Mendin> Scholar seemed like he swung faster than #1 so he's probably gonna love that
[3:40:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Yo, there's a guy
[3:40:53] <CappuccinoGuil> THAT'S A GUY
[3:40:55] <%Lizard0TM> LUL
[3:40:56] <+MelodyMedley> Big boy

I’ll be getting a PS5 (at some point) and start playing FF14, so 1) any suggestions on a compatible keyboard? And 2) how will I know if I’m cool enough to play a femroe? Thanks for everything!
[3:45:52] <aura_00> Pat is safe from his mind goblins... for now
[3:45:55] <+MelodyMedley> Pretty much infinite and they're not too strong or weak
[3:45:56] <tanarath> Either you love it despite the ripoff, or you hate it because of it despite the new ideas.

[3:46:51] <Visorak6> This will be the first souls game I'd actually say some kind of thematic sketch of the zones as a map like sekiro would be apprciated
[3:46:58] <MacMog> @elkriverdog pretty much any USB keyboard should work, at least for the main keys (media keys, etc. maybe not)

[3:48:28] <CappuccinoGuil> you all are fucking losing it LUL
[3:48:29] <Visorak6> Probably as you get upgrades

[3:48:42] <%Cuddl3F1st> solomon is parry god
[3:48:47] <+skylerpilot> big boy was my pick for sure
[3:48:55] <Cymen90> @CappuccinoGuil He played the lute for the shop lady and she had a unique animation for listening and it healed him
[3:48:57] <Visorak6> could it be that dying only resets the zone you're in?
[3:49:13] <%MrGuy516> is this worth the $30 for the PS5 version?
[3:49:13] <+MelodyMedley> I might actually get this game at some point now
[3:49:15] <%Cuddl3F1st> normal + harden
[3:49:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @Cymen90 15/10 game of the generation holy shit
[3:49:17] <%Alazull> So would it be like Dark Souls=DMC, Code Vein=God of War, and this is like Dante's Inferno for Souls-likes?
[3:49:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> It feels like there should be one more attack in these combos
[3:49:26] <aura_00> donk
[3:49:28] <+JobbedBone> he has an idea on his back
[3:49:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @MrGuy516 do you like DS or Sekiro?
[3:49:34] <Parapattern> @CappuccinoGuil It also did a sick riff
[3:49:43] <NocturnalRites> This shell is pretty sick once you get some skills
[3:49:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> could perhaps use some polish
[3:50:12] <%Cuddl3F1st> this is definitely my favorite shell
[3:50:19] <aura_00> ok, how cool would a metal themed souls-like be though?
[3:50:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @PatStaresAt you can run off a ledge and harden to splash attack
[3:50:20] <Brofarian> you.....did it.
[3:50:20] <alroy900> @CappuccinoGuil the lute also turned into rock metal for a split second during the heal
[3:50:24] <%VoidBaronJules> this game sounds and looks chunky
[3:50:25] <%Cuddl3F1st> big boy gets REALLY good once you upgrade him
[3:50:27] <%Lizard0TM> PLAY WITH HIM
[3:50:27] <+JobbedBone> its refreshing to get some level geometry we would NEVER see in souls, but maybe theres a reason
[3:50:28] <ozymandiazii> wow thats an annoying death rattle
[3:50:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @alroy900 I need to get back on this game, damn
[3:50:42] <shoobieredgrave> its crazy how much this shits on code vein
[3:50:45] <tanarath> pat, jam with the guitar
[3:50:47] <Reanimator83> This is the shell I played the game with after I got it

[3:50:50] <%Cuddl3F1st> jam sesh
[3:50:52] <%Mendin> Give this shell some ember and flame effects and you got yourself the Soul of Cinder

[3:55:51] <@SoFarFetched> these guys are making me think big chicken men with the red hoods and beaks geefBlank
[3:55:57] <+Wandor__> Does this game have fashion souls? (armor to find and wear)
[3:56:02] <%Cuddl3F1st> solomon gains crazy resolve
[3:56:03] <RyuuAoi> @macmog It also said Monster Hunter! Hmmmmm
[3:56:08] <%Broand> You have an item which teleports you back to the maiden (but it costs all your shit
[3:56:13] <MacMog> they really exploit their superior reach
[3:56:15] <NocturnalRites> yeah this dude is all about tankiness and has an ability that makes you do more damage the more enemies you kill without dieing
[3:56:19] <+enternius> @Wandor__ Not at all
[3:56:25] <RICE02> Solomon was born on a Monday

[3:57:24] <RyuuAoi> @macmog Damn. I missed it. Or I was present...cocaine is a hell of a drug.
[3:57:30] <NocturnalRites> yeah the hardening mechanic is super vital, you get bopped for not using it enough
[3:57:37] <Discount_CJ> Could this game be classified as an indie?
[3:57:39] <%Cuddl3F1st> these guys are fun...
[3:57:43] <+ninja_galt> lag made it instant replay paty taking a bardiche to the face like an old chuck norris movie
[3:57:49] <Brofarian> @Wandor__ the game really makes you FEEL like you're a dark souls

[3:58:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's indie, but it's apparently made by vets, still it's a small team
[3:58:36] <+enternius> This game feels like trash
[3:58:36] <+Wandor__> I hope it feels better than lords of the fallen
[3:58:40] <+MelodyMedley> Back home
[3:58:46] <+skylerpilot> yeah its short and janky but its decent. its also a pretty crazy as a first game from an indie studio

[4:12:14] <$RealThiele> hammer spot?
[4:12:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye

[4:13:20] <%Cuddl3F1st> bonk me harder daddy
[4:13:22] <Brofarian> don't listen to them Pat, letting the enemies hit you is a viable strategy
[4:13:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> go to horny jail
[4:13:25] <%heartlesshealer> =p
[4:13:29] <%Teyaric> Is the failed parry a fucking "Knock you out of your body" level bonk?
[4:13:37] <%Mendin> Oh man if that crossbow rock bonked and killed him in soul form before he re-entered
[4:13:37] <+enternius> The chisel poisons
[4:13:41] <Albedo28> big stink clouds
[4:13:43] <Visorak6> Does your weapon poison?
[4:13:48] <+enternius> Look at the green particles when you swing it
[4:13:50] <%heartlesshealer> he poison
[4:13:52] <$Dakuu75> ah, a fellow connoisseur of the audacious~
[4:13:52] <+enternius> Anything green in a game is poison
[4:13:59] <%Movemeister> got the stink lines and everything
[4:13:59] <Albedo28> lute man returns!
[4:14:03] <%Cuddl3F1st> yes
[4:14:08] <+marlborored5> the chisel has a aura on it, maybe it applies poison @PatStaresAt
[4:14:14] <%barkon345> the game play in this seems awesome but my god these environments look super drab and generic
[4:14:15] <Brofarian> nice
[4:14:16] <$bootysteve> did you just shove a hammer through the hard way
[4:14:20] <GelatinFellow> yee stab that dude with a hammer
[4:14:22] <PrinceOfEden> LUL
[4:14:23] <%Cuddl3F1st> pat back at the other camp is a tunnel, there's a shell back there
[4:14:26] <Cluntch_Diddler> the blade has poison
[4:14:35] <%barkon345> has pat tried out the Strive demo yet?
[4:14:36] <%fritz_dacat> Gotta love these confident strolls they take up to you
[4:14:41] <ZE_Count> Is game good??
[4:14:41] <BabyNaBackbrace> I wanted to enjoy this game, but didn't
[4:14:42] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> no, that IS the way
[4:14:44] <Bazal68k> Hmm, game looks familiar somehow LUL
[4:14:45] <%Cuddl3F1st> it's on "secret" you dont wanna miss
[4:14:45] <%heartlesshealer> can pat check his weapon to not be confused?
[4:14:47] <lonosi55> Is this a free game???
[4:14:48] <%Mendin> That is a -ton- of fish statues wow
[4:15:05] <+FrogCatapult> Is Pat surprised he's enjoying himself?
[4:15:07] <+za7az> @lonosi55 No? Why would it be?
[4:15:10] <+MelodyMedley> @lonosi55 You really think this would be free? LUL
[4:15:10] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> up that mountain path is the right way
[4:15:11] <Zbyrd0961> wait free?
[4:15:16] <lonosi55> Why is it just ripping off dark souls
[4:15:16] <GarrisonPrime> Nothing says Scholar like a fucking pick axe
[4:15:43] <%Mendin> @GarrisonPrime Archaeology, my friend!
[4:15:55] <%DappercatEsquire> is there an estus equivalent in this game?
[4:16:02] <Brofarian> @lonosi55 cuz dark souls is over, might as well fill the power vacuum
[4:16:04] <$Dakuu75> Could you honestly see any kind of 3rd person game with knights and NOT call it a souls-rip-off?
[4:16:05] <MacMog> @garrisonprime tell that to Yoshi-P
[4:16:09] <%Cuddl3F1st> shell in the cave by the other camp
[4:16:09] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Archaeology? All I know is geology jermaThing
[4:16:15] <+MelodyMedley> Nah, there's a moongrass with the mushrooms though
[4:16:18] <$RealThiele> fuck those bags
[4:16:21] <+Carquar> @lonosi55 Not really a ripoff, there's enough different mechanics. Also looks a hell of a lot better.
[4:16:22] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> ye
[4:16:23] <+EmptyPenguin> everything is a rip-off of something
[4:16:24] <%Cuddl3F1st> PAT SHELL
[4:16:25] <wasdsf> "archeology is people stuff"
[4:16:28] <%debugdrawray_> this stone mechanic didnt sell me at all at the beginning but now it looks fucking awesome
[4:16:46] <+MelodyMedley> Bonk
[4:16:54] <Brofarian> The bonk is always so good!
[4:16:56] <$RealThiele> the greatsword moveset seems meh with harden personally
[4:16:56] <Albedo28> huge stink on that archer
[4:17:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Best part of this game is the arrows bouncing off you NEVER stops being funny
[4:17:05] <lonosi55> It came out and no one played it. If they were smart they wouldve made it free
[4:17:11] <%barkon345> @Dakuu75 it could be an Elder scrolls rip off. I know those are not 3rd person but they can be played 3rd person
[4:17:11] <%heartlesshealer> offhand dagger/piton/spike seems to have the poison
[4:17:13] <%heartlesshealer> it glow
[4:17:15] <%Cuddl3F1st> AUDACITY
[4:17:16] <+MelodyMedley> Wow they are

[4:17:27] <+MelodyMedley> The sheer audacity
[4:17:28] <+twohitgood> I can't wait until they come out with a full game.

[4:18:06] <goose_tech> i love the death ragdoll
[4:18:06] <Cluntch_Diddler> he do it twice indeed
[4:18:08] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Upgrade your weapon tho
[4:18:08] <Shining_Armor> I mean, it is a pole arm.
[4:18:09] <aura_00> Pat, he's done it everytime
[4:18:11] <$RealThiele> rotten food!
[4:18:15] <%heartlesshealer> Learning appear
[4:18:20] <%DappercatEsquire> @CappuccinoGuil  @TheDrugWeCallWifi almost certain I've seen this guy have bad takes/troll before, don't bother
[4:18:22] <%twistingt0rt0ise> Are ya wining son?
[4:18:24] <%Lion_kun> Should healed
[4:18:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> So is this game fun?
[4:18:34] <CappuccinoGuil> What about the shop? Do you have anything to buy?
[4:18:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @DappercatEsquire gotcha
[4:18:50] <%Cuddl3F1st> yes
[4:18:50] <$Dakuu75> YEAH, let me jsut DIP my weapon in ACID~!!! That'll make it stronge. Makes sense
[4:18:59] <Brofarian> ofcourse it's only for one weapon
[4:18:59] <%Cuddl3F1st> dont worry there's a bunch
[4:18:59] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I think you can shortcut back there if you start pointed at the game start, turn right, hug the left wall
[4:19:01] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @DappercatEsquire Thanks for the tip but I live for nuclear takes
[4:19:20] <%Cuddl3F1st> i think there's more oil than there are weapon upgrade slots
[4:19:21] <%DappercatEsquire> @TheDrugWeCallWifi oh agreed they're fun to see
[4:19:24] <Shining_Armor> @Dakuu75 You didn't know that dipping a weapon in acid gives it Acid damage?
[4:19:25] <%heartlesshealer> at least it's a good weapon
[4:19:34] <%debugdrawray_> @Dakuu75 acid quenching is a real thing
[4:19:35] <%Cuddl3F1st> you can max weapons pretty easy
[4:19:53] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i believe some of that upgrade oil is missible tho
[4:20:06] <krabthecrab> Is this game related to Dark Souls or do people just not care about pretending not to be a Dark Souls clone anymore?
[4:20:08] <%Cuddl3F1st> the shell you missed is dodgy thief boy, that's 4/4
[4:20:11] <brunoberserk> coward shell
[4:20:11] <$Dakuu75> of course chat is gonna tell me "acid-dipping" is a real thing. (I should've known)
[4:20:12] <Shining_Armor> @debugdrawray_ Yeah but it's raw acid though, there's no smelting involved here is there?
[4:20:33] <%Cuddl3F1st> tank, dodgy, parry, harden. those are your classes
[4:20:38] <%barkon345> how can you tell all the enviroments look the same
[4:20:40] <Albedo28> now this is dark souls. Just running past everything because fuck it
[4:20:43] <+MelodyMedley> Here's the right way
[4:20:47] <lonosi55> Irs a shameless dark souls clone
[4:20:59] <$Dakuu75> The sweet sound of Audacity, it sings to me
[4:21:04] <%Cuddl3F1st> back
[4:21:10] <%Cuddl3F1st> you're passing the shell again lol
[4:21:20] <%CalderGaming> science time
[4:21:21] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt New shell is behind you
[4:21:22] <Shining_Armor> I hope they never give up.
[4:21:24] <LunarRemix> Seems to suffer the same souls problem of just running past enemies
[4:21:34] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> they de-aggro pretty quick from what I remember
[4:21:37] <%Mendin> I think he's corpse-running first
[4:21:40] <%Cuddl3F1st> oh boy.
[4:21:46] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> especially through a hole!
[4:21:50] <RyuuAoi> Do a barrel roll!
[4:21:53] <%Cuddl3F1st> he ran past his corpse lol
[4:21:53] <Albedo28> nice hole
[4:21:55] <%Teyaric> Man that is a loading crouch and a half
[4:21:55] <+MelodyMedley> Crawl space time
[4:21:56] <RyuuAoi> Wrong game,...
[4:22:00] <%WhereIsWill> loading screen af
[4:22:00] <%moonmintparadise> it would be so funny if there was just an army of enemies crawling behind you
[4:22:00] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> there's 1 enemy type that NEVER de-aggros
[4:22:02] <Albedo28> it was made for him
[4:22:07] <$Dakuu75> swear to fucking god, if you look behind you and they're following you through this dank tunnel. I'll lose my shit
[4:22:09] <+MelodyMedley> @Cuddl3F1st Nah, he picked up the corpse
[4:22:12] <Shining_Armor> No
[4:22:16] <%Cuddl3F1st> CIRCLE

[4:22:32] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> Grisha room lol
[4:22:34] <Albedo28> lol
[4:22:35] <+MelodyMedley> New shortcut!
[4:22:35] <%moonmintparadise> this game looks pretty cool like aesthetic wise
[4:22:36] <%Cuddl3F1st> this whole game is a circle
[4:22:40] <+MisterMukkey> this game is very green. does the environment ever change?
[4:22:41] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> fukn lost
[4:22:48] <RyuuAoi> @cuddl3f1st NO. FIRST BOSS FOUNTAIN
[4:22:50] <+DragonArt07> this is where you fought grisha

[4:22:59] <+enternius> @MisterMukkey Kind of
[4:23:03] <@SoFarFetched> now Im having that song "Walk around in Circles" playing in my head.
[4:23:04] <+MelodyMedley> Made a full loop
[4:23:09] <+enternius> It's like swamp versions of different environments but they all have a similar palette
[4:23:12] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> you've seen like 1/3rd of the total swamp zone too
[4:23:22] <$spardanwarrior> Wrong hole
[4:23:25] <Albedo28> I remember this dude from the demo
[4:23:25] <Shining_Armor> "Walk around in circles"? The old CN song?
[4:23:27] <+nekodelic> wrong hole
[4:23:28] <+MelodyMedley> This is a different one
[4:23:30] <CappuccinoGuil> That's where you found solomon
[4:23:33] <RyuuAoi> Wait...are y'all saying Pat ain't making progress?
[4:23:34] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah that one,with the cartoon network characters.
[4:23:34] <+MelodyMedley> This is where you found Solomon
[4:23:34] <$Dakuu75> how much of this game is swamps, btw?
[4:23:35] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> wrong hole
[4:23:37] <%Cuddl3F1st> these guys are fun
[4:23:38] <%Mendin> There's two holes in Grisha's cave
[4:23:41] <%WhereIsWill> this feels confusing af
[4:23:45] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this is where you got your 2nd shell
[4:23:47] <@SoFarFetched> That song gets stuck in my head randomly and moreso right now.
[4:23:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait nah I thought you wanted in the cave
[4:23:56] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> hug right wall
[4:23:59] <Shining_Armor> Man, cartoon networks old music videos... Way to make me feel old.
[4:24:06] <%Piemono> So many Funholes
[4:24:11] <BabyNaBackbrace> paying a toll?
[4:24:12] <%Cuddl3F1st> "well you see son, there's 3 holes you gotta worry about"
[4:24:14] <GameOver_Here> This swamp confused the fuck out of me.
[4:24:16] <BabyNaBackbrace> in this hole?
[4:24:19] <RyuuAoi> @shining_armor Oh fuck
[4:24:22] <+MelodyMedley> Grisha's cave has a lot of holes
[4:24:25] <@SoFarFetched> Josie and the Pussycat one and Jabbajaw were really good too geefPoint
[4:24:28] <Albedo28> always gotta find the right hole. Big important there
[4:24:33] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this is a loading screen
[4:24:42] <Garry_Guyface> Damn this Monster Hunter Rise gameplay is slow af
[4:24:44] <+Shacklebox> I can't tell between videogame beast noises and Zangief beast noises
[4:24:46] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Man, I miss the Boomerang channel
[4:24:46] <@SoFarFetched> actually most of their music videos were really good.
[4:24:47] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> you can 'sprint' through the hole to crawl faster
[4:24:49] <%Cuddl3F1st> NEVER go in the wrong hole
[4:24:53] <%king_wragles> Pussycats only had one song, admit it
[4:24:55] <@SoFarFetched> I don't remember there being a bad one.
[4:24:57] <RyuuAoi> @albedo28 Not true. You can always make it fit if you try hard enough.
[4:25:12] <@SoFarFetched> hey look that one where josie and the pussycats were switching genres though
[4:25:24] <Albedo28> then they caught him
[4:25:27] <Albedo28> nice stand

[4:27:41] <%YakumoYomi> M O R T I S
[4:27:42] <NocturnalRites> harden more
[4:27:46] <%Cuddl3F1st> he sets you on fire so you take DoT
[4:27:53] <SomeOtherNeb> hi Pat, how are you liking this game? I thought it was pretty fun
[4:27:56] <%Cuddl3F1st> DONT GET HIT
[4:27:58] <$NumeroHoowan> become E R E C T
[4:28:13] <$Dakuu75> wtf is that option that pops up "callt he worm fish"?
[4:28:25] <codepoke> it means leave
[4:28:26] <+enternius> That's just to leave this fight
[4:28:30] <+MelodyMedley> Calling the worm fish sends you out of the fight
[4:28:30] <Albedo28> two men of hardening right here
[4:28:34] <+OmegaFatalis> two dudes just getting hard together
[4:28:42] <%Cuddl3F1st> running attack is your friend
[4:28:51] <TheHotStuven> Press H to harden your dick
[4:28:54] <+MelodyMedley> The battle of hardness
[4:28:56] <%Cuddl3F1st> running leap shreks this guy
[4:29:04] <SomeOtherNeb> as much as I enjoy Mortal Shell, the fact that the boss is an anagram of HARDEN makes me mad every time
[4:29:05] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> aw ye gettim
[4:29:07] <codepoke> mortal shell in a nutshell: Two HARD men SWING at each other until one COLLAPSES
[4:29:08] <HeroToxiko> footsies: the boss
[4:29:12] <+MelodyMedley> YEAH
[4:29:14] <aura_00> just guys bein' dudes, what's better than this?

[4:30:05] <huskarl_zap> return to koi
[4:30:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Everything s a knife if you try hard enough
[4:30:18] <SwindlerOfProgress> Given enough force, you can stab with anything
[4:30:19] <$Dakuu75> you can stab someone with anything, if it goes fast enough
[4:30:20] <%fritz_dacat> transport by giant fish Not a bird?? this game is crazy
[4:30:21] <aura_00> you can stab anyone with anything with enough force
[4:30:23] <%Cuddl3F1st> BIG BOY TIME
[4:30:24] <+MelodyMedley> Big wide weapon
[4:30:31] <%Cuddl3F1st> BIG BOY WEAPONS FOR BIG BOYS
[4:30:38] <%maybefalco> big meaty weapon
[4:30:40] <Albedo28> ooh that overhead looks chonky
[4:30:42] <TheAntiNihilist> that's fAst
[4:30:46] <Ekaelis> Now this looks way cooler than all the oversized maces and hammers in DS3
[4:30:49] <+MelodyMedley> Might wanna talk with the nun
[4:30:49] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> can't wait for you to unlock all the SUPER MOVES
[4:30:54] <%Cuddl3F1st> BIG MEATY BIG
[4:30:58] <%Cuddl3F1st> BIG AND HARD

[4:31:34] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> nice
[4:31:34] <$Dakuu75> HOLY SHIT, you BROKE his shield!
[4:31:34] <%Cuddl3F1st> you see that shield just break?
[4:31:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bodied that guy
[4:31:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> YOO SHEILDBREAKER
[4:31:38] <Visorak6> Shield DESTROYED
[4:31:47] <+MelodyMedley> That shield just got destroyed
[4:31:51] <%Cuddl3F1st> BIG AND MEATY
[4:31:55] <Albedo28> there is no crowd control, despite that huge ass swing arc
[4:32:05] <%Teyaric> But it's so big and slow?
[4:32:10] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> slow start up sure
[4:32:11] <%Cuddl3F1st> you gotta harden mid swing for that boy
[4:32:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> REally? It seems pretty good?
[4:32:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Dexy Boys only club
[4:32:19] <+MelodyMedley> Cool
[4:32:19] <+jjhoho> your run animation was kinda hilarious while holding it
[4:32:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> there's a Slower weapon even
[4:32:28] <%brickwall35> do meth tomorrow
[4:32:32] <tanarath> Kotur
[4:32:32] <+jjhoho> looked like a ds1 poopwalk
[4:32:34] <+MelodyMedley> I quite like Mortal Shell know that I've seen it
[4:32:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> coatoar
[4:32:37] <%AzureGale> Is that a promise
[4:32:41] <Pookiedaexzile> That one bad weapon just tanked a full LP Game designers learn
[4:32:50] <+SocialMisfitGamer> KOTOR Finale!? LET'S GOOO
[4:32:54] <lonosi55> No more mortal shell
[4:32:55] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I think that's an auto-rotate feature?
[4:32:57] <%Tman451> cross-gen maybe?
[4:32:59] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt as far as souls-likes go, is this one of the better ones?
[4:33:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cloud saves?
[4:33:15] <dexdestroyazz> cloud save?
[4:33:18] <Shining_Armor> Maybe if you delete one you can restore it?
[4:33:21] <%vehementvadr> more like restore paige amiright psaDab
[4:33:28] <%maybefalco> oh incase you break the game probably and need to revert
[4:33:29] <$Dakuu75> confusing
[4:33:39] <Albedo28> game breaks often enough for a baked-in restore. Nice
[4:33:43] <%Cuddl3F1st> "good jank"
[4:33:44] <+MelodyMedley> @lonosi55 We get it kid you don't like the game LUL
[4:33:51] <%heartlesshealer> thanks for hosting
[4:34:01] <%maenos2> i heard apparently the second dlc for doom eternal is out next week, any plans for that if so?
[4:34:04] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt There was a bug that crashes at the load screen and deletes your save, that's why that's there.
[4:34:06] <%BoxNavy> huh...
[4:34:10] <captainnathaniel> So no more mortal shell?
[4:34:14] <huskarl_zap> OSFrog Gorf
[4:34:18] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> There's a couple boss encounters where you save into the fight arena and can't back out. So probably so you CAN back out.
[4:34:33] <%BoxNavy> wizened streamer
[4:34:46] <%Cuddl3F1st> code vein is awful. i love it.
[4:34:47] <Albedo28> man that white palace didn't matter much in the end
[4:34:52] <lonosi55> NO ONE LIKES THE GAME. NO ONE ASKED PAT TO PLAY THIS.
[4:34:53] <%heartlesshealer> CHURCH OF MAZE
[4:34:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Cooooooonnnnnnttraaaast
[4:34:57] <+OmegaFatalis> holy fuck that area sucks
[4:35:01] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> And it's far less interesting to explore
[4:35:05] <dizimous> I mean that place looks cool but GOD is it too big
[4:35:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Lol
[4:35:16] <+MelodyMedley> @lonosi55 LUL
[4:35:21] <%Cuddl3F1st> terrible game. great game.
[4:35:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Poise theft
[4:35:36] <T_Sasquatch> Im sure code vein is decent
[4:35:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Code Vein is the most 7/10 game I've ever played.
[4:35:47] <Albedo28> loved the game, except for the child in the bikini who makes weapons for you. That was a bit too JP for me
[4:36:04] <%ThirdWelles> He was hardcasting Veraero
[4:36:07] <garryjohanson> ya not many people got to much good to say about code vein
[4:36:08] <%ThirdWelles> Just
[4:36:09] <%ThirdWelles> constantly
[4:36:09] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...that Red Mage totally hard casted Verthunder, didn't they? NotLikeThis
[4:36:11] <%heartlesshealer> code vein is otherwise "okay". Last areas get very indoor samey to the point that I got bored and didn't complete a first playthrough though
[4:36:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[4:36:18] <+barkon345> did he play the monster hunter demo?
[4:36:27] <%Piemono> 2nd Choice! 2nd Choice!
[4:36:30] <+OmegaFatalis> truth
[4:36:32] <%ThirdWelles> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense Yes. The whole dungeon
[4:36:33] <%heartlesshealer> but that's me. Other people might like it a hell of a lot more
[4:36:42] <garryjohanson> in 2021 theres so many options a game cant afford to be "ok" i feel
[4:36:47] <+MelodyMedley> @barkon345 Yeah, the demo was earlier this stream
[4:37:02] <dizimous> Fem roes are so cool
[4:37:03] <%ElkRiverDog> Yay!
[4:37:06] <%ThirdWelles> This centipede
[4:37:08] <%ThirdWelles> is a predator
[4:37:10] <garryjohanson> but i feel like code vein was a good first effort
[4:37:14] <T_Sasquatch> Fem roessssssssss
[4:37:19] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @ThirdWelles That hurts the soul
[4:37:22] <%heartlesshealer> Giraffes eat bones
[4:37:27] <T_Sasquatch> Big muscle waifu
[4:37:29] <garryjohanson> chat do you realise that if code vein 2 happens and its good. that could open the door to namco making ds4 without fromsoft?
[4:37:29] <%CopperTucker> There's a R18+ venue on Jenova called the Roehouse and it's amazing @PatStaresAt
[4:37:31] <%WhereIsWill> but cmon tho
[4:37:34] <garryjohanson> do you realise this
[4:37:39] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @PatStaresAt did you watch the Monster Hunter movie?
[4:37:40] <Albedo28> Code Vein was certainly a better souls like than God Eater is a Monster hunter
[4:37:48] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> resident evil story is the best because its the worst
[4:37:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes. Even 7
[4:38:01] <%ThirdWelles> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense You know what hurts the soul more? "Hey man, hardcast Jolt to proc swift on your Ver spells," "I know my rotation"
[4:38:06] <Daniel_Is_I> He doesn't sleep through the night because he sleeps all day
[4:38:11] <%heartlesshealer> code vein just needs better dungeon design
[4:38:20] <%heartlesshealer> government building was boring
[4:38:23] <garryjohanson> @PatStaresAt stupid in what sense? idk the lore really
[4:38:25] <+MelodyMedley> Thanks for the nice streams as always Pat!
[4:38:36] <%weissguard> Thanks for stream
[4:38:37] <+Kharinite> thanks for the stream pat
[4:38:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @garryjohanson it was a good first effort yeah...but ya know what was a better first effort? Nioh 1, though I do hope CV does something
[4:38:52] <Albedo28> also needed less slidey motion no matter how fast you're moving
[4:39:01] <ChungusQuest> Yeah, but dual volcano RPG headshots, though!
[4:39:02] <+BettyMwwaahh> but maybe this retcon wil be good
[4:39:12] <Pookiedaexzile> People constantly drink the Monster Juice
[4:39:17] <+OmegaFatalis> Wesker was only smart until Ouroboros
[4:39:18] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> the thing i love most about RE lore is the part in 5 where wesker's plan is to kill 90% of the world and the other 10% will be EXACTLY AS STRONG as him. therefore he will rule them all. somehow
[4:39:27] <Pookiedaexzile> IT will never get past that
[4:39:27] <garryjohanson> KosOrSomeSayKosm_ also mortal shell. its only issue is the controls are clunky
[4:39:30] <@SoFarFetched> oh no Im gonna be sent there twice
[4:39:31] <garryjohanson> and i guess its short
[4:39:34] <+Kharinite> have a good night pa
[4:39:36] <coffeewithmcauley> :(
[4:39:38] <+Kharinite> pat*
[4:39:40] <%asgard147> Thanks for the stream Pat limesLove
[4:39:43] <ChungusQuest> I will always love RE for giving us COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[4:39:46] <Albedo28> peace!
[4:39:46] <lonosi55> Nah. We leaving
[4:39:47] <%AzureGale> Good night nerds
[4:39:47] <%heartlesshealer> good night everyone
[4:39:50] <%Movemeister> seeya
[4:39:55] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @ThirdWelles gross. Just awful.
[4:39:57] <%ThirdWelles> Bye pat <3
[4:39:58] <+MelodyMedley> See ya later Pat!
[4:40:02] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Bye Pat-man
