[0:21:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Thanks JK Rowling
[0:21:30] <+Pyroclase> @QueequegTheater I'm pretty sure Pat called it when he said Ahti is just the Oldest House.
[0:21:30] <+Bad1uck> I feel like Ahti is a STAND of The Oldest House
[0:21:33] <Mendin> Is... is Ahti from The City?
[0:21:33] <%dukenux> Is it the same Janitor from the beginning?
[0:21:33] <%TheBitingIrish> Wtf, they couldn't bother animating the pull cords?

[0:22:37] <Valdorick> He's just the house, its fine.
[0:22:39] <%d00msdaydan> or the oldest house is god
[0:22:39] <%Frostydough1> Pat God IS a bad guy
[0:22:42] <%QueequegTheater> Ahti vs. Gaunter O'Dimm for Summerslam
[0:22:43] <Dovakhin573> hes morgan freeman
[0:22:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Are you there God? It’s me, Pat
[0:22:45] <+HotBloodedHero> But are you killing god?
[0:22:46] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 the best part of that isn't that they're magicing it away. Its that all they're doing is moving it to a different location and employing "out of sight, out of mind." Wizard communities would have been fucking FILTHY and to employ a phrase from Eternal Darkness, "rife with foetor".
[0:22:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> God is a Finnish janitor

[0:24:53] <%RubberFistFight> @DomunDomunDomun toilets move it to a purpose-built facility that is designed to separate the water from the... solids... and treat the water so it's once again usable for things. Not really the same thing as "wishing it away".
[0:25:00] <$MachoMadnesss94> you can do the ground pound upwards just so you know
[0:25:07] <%some_sunflowers> @AngriestPat That's where they saw the mermaid.

[0:28:24] <$rytyoung> @rubberfistfight that's right so it did
[0:28:25] <+Pyroclase> It took me like 15 tries to beat [redacted]
[0:28:26] <ivansonic08> Why does the protagonists look so much cooler now
[0:28:26] <IndoorSitup> From what I've seen of this game it seems like the pistol is the only gun you ever get.
[0:28:26] <%mistymntns> mistymntns subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Oh Hot Damn this is one year. What cool people you are. Have fun and Im going to get a drink. Haha.
[0:28:27] <%floralkami> @pharmakokinetic um.... i don't think any game will be worth that

[0:28:58] <%QueequegTheater> Courage the Cowardly Dog
[0:28:59] <+Pyroclase> This is the MOST nowhere in the entire building
[0:29:01] <%zaworldo> Open the maaaap
[0:29:03] <latgeek> this is clearly somewhere dummy
[0:29:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @pharmakokinetic Its rife with bugs and problems that Epic doesn't seem to care fixing
[0:29:07] <beetbo2> what a beautiful nowhere
[0:29:07] <ミュウレ4242> ♪long road to ruin, there in your eyes.♪
[0:29:09] <%QueequegTheater> Welcome to Ash Lake

[0:29:15] <$MachoMadnesss94> now he has no health for the sick janitor duel
[0:29:16] <Dragovus> It was Silent Hill all along!
[0:29:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> fog?
[0:29:16] <+JopeStarcraft> Its Ash Lake.
[0:29:17] <%marsanta> Welcome to the foundations
[0:29:17] <Mister_McDerp> void
[0:29:17] <%some_sunflowers> Visual clues will become discrete answers shortly.
[0:29:17] <Graxe_> Might as well be Ash Lake
[0:29:19] <+Bad1uck> Void
[0:29:19] <Cdjgamer> andor lando?
[0:29:20] <latgeek> this is VERY aperture science actually
[0:29:21] <%Teintstein> it's just infinite void
[0:29:22] <beetbo2> THE VOID
[0:29:23] <TheMorilo> this is beyond the map, just like fallout 4
[0:29:24] <ZE_Count> I guess this the foundation..
[0:29:24] <$rytyoung> @mule4242 under the cold street lights!
[0:29:25] <%Frostydough1> We're in the outer wilds now
[0:29:25] <%CJett92> V O I D
[0:29:28] <%Dr_Mooose> just empty
[0:29:28] <Midnight188> oh hey I think we found the....FOUNDATION [ahyukhyuk]
[0:29:29] <beetbo2> it's the void, pat my boi
[0:29:33] <pandafaustin> Ahti lives in Ash Lake confirmed
[0:29:34] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Look for the hunter's dream
[0:29:35] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Welcome to Silent Hill
[0:29:36] <%Big_Dream> it's where to bored of directors live
[0:29:38] <%zaworldo> recognize that singing?
[0:29:41] <Marpolo13> always wanted to visit the void
[0:29:41] <%Typhaeon> No, not THAT Foundation, the other one Kappa
[0:29:41] <Valdorick> Just be careful, don't want Ahti to tell you that you're going to die over and over again, and lose your souls until you go hiss.
[0:29:45] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I'm getting BIG Ash Lake vibes from this
[0:29:48] <%shurtal> from here to the end, prolly the raddest part of the game
[0:29:52] <Rosy_Joan> This looks like the Eye of the Universe from Outer Wilds
[0:29:54] <beetbo2> @Dragovus @AngriestPat isn't this similar to the SIlent Hill bad ending song?
[0:29:59] <%RubberFistFight> man the second i start my streaming rig up my cat Grover starts yelling at me. I can't figure out what he's associated it with but every damn time without fail he's quiet all morning til I hit the on switch and then "MYAAAOOWW!! MIAOOORRR!!! MWAAAAAARROOO!!!"
[0:30:02] <rosemon5001> this is some smacking music
[0:30:03] <beetbo2> the one where he dies?
[0:30:05] <$rytyoung> ding ding ding
[0:30:05] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat weird old man whatever nationality ati is, music has never been scarier
[0:30:05] <%hntronium> dark

[0:30:13] <%RubberFistFight> I love him to bits but damn I wish he wasn't so noisy sometimes.
[0:30:17] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat what are the odds of this being a dimensional nexus?
[0:30:17] <%Teintstein> perkele
[0:30:19] <+MediocreHermits> reminds me of the forest in outer wilds
[0:30:19] <%CJett92> Very nice of the infinite void to have a bottom
[0:30:22] <+Bad1uck> This aprt has a floor
[0:30:23] <Cdjgamer> all foundations have floors pat
[0:30:24] <%WackyGear> wat that fog
[0:30:36] <@lewdskeletor13> Alan Wake steps through a portal at the end “We need all the warriors Jesse” cue sequel
[0:30:43] <$rytyoung> Hope you like beaches
[0:30:46] <iswearimjustdandy> This game has fantastic setting for a game taking place entirely in an office building
[0:30:56] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 "jesse, I need you to recruit five teenagers WITH ATTITUDE!!"
[0:30:58] <%Big_Dream> this game is agood AA

[0:31:08] <%firehawk_420> I’m gonna rewatch the outer wilds streams later, I think. That game warms my heart.
[0:31:08] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight maybe he wants to finally earn his rent
[0:31:09] <%Big_Dream> it did well
[0:31:17] <%Laecerelius> MAAAAAAGIC!
[0:31:22] <%some_sunflowers> FBC uses words to control. Hiss uses words to control. YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.

[0:48:28] <@thenefftw> Something something hell energy
[0:48:28] <%Ynkubus18> C U B E
[0:48:30] <%d00msdaydan> yabai
[0:48:30] <ZE_Count> 99% bad but that 1% might be hot alien chicks!
[0:48:31] <%42nfl19> But @AngriestPat , that is the nature of humanity, to fuck where no human has fucked before!
[0:48:31] <pandafaustin> could be a dimension filled with redbull, you dont know
[0:48:31] <%zaworldo> what
[0:48:31] <+Grayhammatter> it was here, but it's gone now
[0:48:32] <+zeiss_schreiber> What if there was muffins on the other side though?
[0:48:33] <Cdjgamer> its for the greater good
[0:48:34] <%Agami23> but what if its super good though?
[0:48:35] <%Ion_Laser> apatPorgmo
[0:48:35] <%floralkami> To be fair, they did the expedition cause they didn't know what it did
[0:48:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Because they are basically SciFi Scientist who never learn.
[0:48:36] <IndoorSitup> But it might do a totally sick loop de loop!
[0:48:38] <worldbrand> he was using it for the big porns
[0:48:39] <Valdorick> He shoved it SO FAR up his own ass.
[0:48:40] <@lewdskeletor13> What if anime waifus were on the other side?
[0:48:43] <khalcipher> I mean, most of the other portals where good. But you only need one bad to fuck everything.
[0:48:43] <deviljhojho94> S C I E N C E THO
[0:48:45] <jellssssss20> Buuuuut... there could be cool stuff... for science!
[0:48:45] <iswearimjustdandy> Darling totally has it
[0:48:47] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> We do what we must, because , we can.
[0:48:50] <%joylent_blue> touch the projector AND the sand
[0:48:50] <+Taydoinwork182> How do this costume!? Its dope!
[0:48:52] <$MachoMadnesss94> sand, sand, gotta get the sand. sand, sand, gotta get the sand
[0:48:52] <Marpolo13> SAND SCIENCE THOUGH
[0:48:56] <ミュウレ4242> maybe he pointed it down while running it, and dropped it in it' own portal.
[0:48:58] <%d00msdaydan> shove the sand in the projector
[0:49:00] <fusedforms> wait is that on a Control Point???
[0:49:00] <%MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Look in every single room past this point
[0:49:04] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> For the good of all of us except the ones who are dead.
[0:49:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @beetbo2 The tallest of the big boi.
[0:49:09] <%zaworldo> what if darling managed to merge with the projector, like you with other objects of power @AngriestPat
[0:49:13] <%Shadowthedigger> Oh hey Alan Wake.
[0:49:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Are we gonna meet Darling
[0:49:19] <%Deadpal> Remember to watch these videos again afterwards because this is just a small clip of the full video
[0:49:21] <khalcipher> NVM the other portals made their friend into a dog
[0:49:29] <Rosy_Joan> THE GODHAND?!
[0:49:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> FIRST expedition?!
[0:49:31] <Badgerconda_> Never should have trusted Alan Wake to be your lead science man.
[0:49:31] <gekizenbu> "Some casualties"
[0:49:34] <latgeek> I like the implication that a situation where the projector has to be sealed off with people inside the room could happen.
[0:49:40] <Graxe_> Radio signals blocked
[0:49:50] <TheMorilo> they found the fucking godhand
[0:49:54] <HarryWizard> man I can barely hear the game voice audio compared to pat speaking
[0:49:55] <%Jrocy247> Wassup Chatty-
[0:49:56] <+Bad1uck> hiss
[0:49:57] <ape_hawk> yep, hiss got him
[0:50:02] <$MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat there's a Darling video you might want to listed to the music to in as well
[0:50:04] <+Grayhammatter> the hiss got him
[0:50:07] <%tweedler92> Is Darling Griffith?
[0:50:07] <%Jeemukun> you have fucked up sir
[0:50:08] <latgeek> "medical tests show nothing amiss" HIM EARS WERE BLEEDIN
[0:50:12] <%QueequegTheater> Darling Did Nothing Wrong
[0:50:15] <%Hydrapissed> can u watch the whole thing later on?
[0:50:20] <Brother_Coduss> did pat fight the former?
[0:50:22] <@thenefftw> "listen, we mess with some weird stuff, but that thing that's affecting you? nah, probably nothing"
[0:50:27] <%floralkami> @latgeek in the portal, not out
[0:50:28] <%Teintstein> @Brother_Coduss just the first time
[0:50:28] <jellssssss20> Is Trench Griffith??
[0:50:31] <Valdorick> Trench was Hiss Patient 0
[0:50:31] <%mistymntns> Oh boy the next video is A+
[0:50:32] <%QueequegTheater> Jesse a smart girl
[0:50:32] <lionmanguy> So let me get this right. Projector opens to dimensions. They happen to find one that leads to hiss dimension?
[0:50:33] <%StaceMcGate> Kappa1000 Hey Pat,is there any party more broken than T.G Cid from Final Fantasy Tactics? His stats and abilities invalidate essentially all your other party members. Only one that comes close is Citan from Xenogears, whose base speed/attack were double that of most of your party.
[0:50:34] <Cdjgamer> JESSE YOU FK UP
[0:50:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Will skeleton-sensei return to teach us a lesson in this video?
[0:50:40] <khalcipher> Jesse saved millions of lifes there
[0:50:42] <gekizenbu> Darling was up his science ass so hard he managed to screw it up for eveyone involved
[0:50:48] <Tucker0603> YOU FUCKING MORONS
[0:50:49] <Marpolo13> seems evil
[0:50:50] <Badgerconda_> that's the only way to DO SCIENCE PAT
[0:50:50] <+ktothec99> If anyone is curious what the computers in the rooms are: ***
[0:50:51] <Marpolo13> BUT SCIENC
[0:50:53] <%SirGO0SE> Science!
[0:50:53] <ape_hawk> does this make darling Loki?
[0:50:55] <@lewdskeletor13> SCIENCE
[0:50:57] <narusao> what could go wrong?
[0:50:57] <BlindGato> SCIENCE
[0:50:57] <rosemon5001> night mother will hold you softly pat
[0:50:59] <%d00msdaydan> I NEED THIS SCIENCE IN ME
[0:51:00] <%Razputin217> BUT SCIENCE THO
[0:51:00] <Cdjgamer> jesse souldve burn them all
[0:51:02] <%Hydrapissed> was there no notes in that room ?
[0:51:03] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you say that like you wouldnt do it in their position
[0:51:03] <%mistymntns> But Science @AngriestPat SCIENCE
[0:51:04] <astrophizz> oops
[0:51:04] <%Calek> @lionmanguy Jesse's ghost partner is from the same dimension as the hiss and it's the one slide she saved, and it's the one the FBC now has
[0:51:07] <DXLelouch24> oh good he hasnt reached the best part of the fame yet
[0:51:09] <Zebroneath> All in the pursuit of science
[0:51:12] <%AgniBrandt> ... This is actually kinda like Remnant, huh?
[0:51:12] <cerass> More to watch pat
[0:51:12] <%Teintstein> @lionmanguy it's implied that it's not the Hiss dimension so much as a place where a small Hiss presence still exists
[0:51:12] <IndoorSitup> BUT IT MIGHT DO A SICK LOOP DE LOOP
[0:51:13] <%Big_Dream> the frames
[0:51:13] <sendart> lets all jump into the warp what could go wrong?
[0:51:13] <%42nfl19> But @AngriestPat , we need to fuck where no man has fucked before!
[0:51:14] <pandafaustin> are you saying you don't want to suckle on the not-mothers teat pat?
[0:51:14] <DXLelouch24> game*
[0:51:16] <Valdorick> Jessie was a least a child, you fucks were grown ass men going "LETS JUMP INTO THE DIMENSIONAL RIFT! FOR SCIENCE!"
[0:51:17] <+Bad1uck> big fuckups
[0:51:17] <%TheStarbecue> pat just hates science
[0:51:18] <SlimeSlimeSlime> These guys are SCP to the core yo.
[0:51:18] <beetbo2> But we need eldritch ghost wavelength waifus, Pat
[0:51:20] <%Maids4lyfe> don't go that way
[0:51:23] <%QueequegTheater> Darling is WAYYYY less at fault than Trench, to be fair
[0:51:23] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, we need to study this and then make a laser or some shit out of it, duh!
[0:51:23] <%Starlight_Gamer> what does the slide projector do?
[0:51:28] <beetbo2> we need the eldritch waifu
[0:51:28] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat thats not the whole video
[0:51:30] <%superc37> WAIT POLARIS IS A HISS
[0:51:34] <%zaworldo> reality portals
[0:51:35] <beetbo2> for science, of course
[0:51:35] <@lewdskeletor13> Opens portals to other dimensions
[0:51:36] <%Maids4lyfe> everyone keeps falling for that
[0:51:37] <%StaceMcGate> Pat still has a good 3 hours left right?
[0:51:38] <%Big_Dream> your fault
[0:51:38] <%Deadpal> No you turned the wrong way
[0:51:38] <mat2501> I would open the portal
[0:51:40] <ミュウレ4242> beetbo2, ever play saya no uta?
[0:51:40] <thewellroundedgamer99> There was a lift
[0:51:43] <%hawk_rush> why did you drop down tho LU;
[0:51:43] <Marpolo13> MAGIC
[0:51:43] <$MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat you can ground pound upwards
[0:51:43] <%AgniBrandt> At least in terms of how the bullshit happened
[0:51:46] <%superc37> ITNALL MAKES SENSE
[0:51:46] <Mister_McDerp> stargate
[0:51:46] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It's D4C
[0:51:51] <%transporterthesequel> Slide Projector is BAD STARGATE
[0:51:53] <%Maids4lyfe> @thewellroundedgamer99 the lift doesn't work
[0:51:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It projects while doing sick mutli-track slides.
[0:51:56] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat remember you can slam up
[0:51:58] <+Pyroclase> there's another video

[0:52:41] <%floralkami> SHUT UP CHATWE HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE
[0:52:44] <mat2501> NOP
[0:52:45] <beetbo2> stumbo chat
[0:52:45] <worldbrand> the biggest thing that makes their decisions dumber than the Foundation's is that they dont have access to an infinite number of D-class
[0:52:47] <waifoong98> ?????
[0:52:47] <%Calek> @lionmanguy the brother and sister found it in their hometown garbage dump
[0:52:49] <rytisone> And the science gets done, and you make a neat gun for the people who are still alive.
[0:52:55] <%Hydrapissed> hes also jacked to
[0:52:58] <%Teintstein> @lionmanguy they supposedly found the projector in the Ordinary dump and went through the portal to Slidescape-36
[0:52:59] <%Deadpal> Darling is great but he should never have been given as much control as he did
[0:53:02] <asddsa28> why is he so dumb
[0:53:03] <Mister_McDerp> he did make the HRAs though
[0:53:05] <T_Sasquatch> D A R L I N
[0:53:08] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat It is the nature of man to be curious
[0:53:08] <%NeroInfinite> This was where Darling stayed.
[0:53:09] <%Razputin217> He got in over his head
[0:53:10] <%Laecerelius> Scientists tend to be very smart and also super fucking idiotic
[0:53:10] <%Hydrapissed> darling=buff
[0:53:10] <khalcipher> TRENCH FUCK IT UP NOT DARLING
[0:53:12] <%starotter70> Sorry bout that darlin
[0:53:13] <pandafaustin> darling may have made a mistake here and there
[0:53:13] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s also Alan Wake man
[0:53:17] <jellssssss20> They seem to have almost no funding
[0:53:17] <SlimeSlimeSlime> All we need are red strings connecting those pictures.
[0:53:18] <deviljhojho94> He must do science
[0:53:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how Darling is not actively horribly evil, just, a curious fuck-up.
[0:53:20] <%Koosahmii> My only complaint about this game is how quiet Darling talks
[0:53:20] <%johnny_gogo> LOOK AT ALL THAT SOUND PROOFING NEXT TO THE BED
[0:53:23] <jellssssss20> Maybe that’s the problem?
[0:53:24] <IndoorSitup> This is some Aperture Science shit right here.
[0:53:26] <deviljhojho94> Darling fucks
[0:53:26] <%zaworldo> What...is hedron
[0:53:27] <Valdorick> He crazy'd the HRAs hours before the hiss outbreak.
[0:53:27] <bear_breaker20> Darling would be doing ASMR videos if not this game
[0:53:29] <%some_sunflowers> Desperate is a great way to express things.
[0:53:30] <T_Sasquatch> Darling in the control
[0:53:33] <waifoong98> CUBES
[0:53:34] <gekizenbu> they have invisible infinite funding
[0:53:34] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[0:53:35] <%floralkami> PAT, TRENCH FUCKED IT UP, NOT RDARLING
[0:53:35] <%NeroInfinite> Yep

[0:57:14] <$MachoMadnesss94> Darling is swol
[0:57:15] <%CJett92> He "exposed" himself to the vube?
[0:57:16] <%42nfl19> He is jacked for a nerd

[0:57:29] <Tucker0603> SHE HOLDS BACK THE HISS
[0:57:29] <khalcipher> @Badgerconda_ lol
[0:57:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That was probably a bad idea. Anything that leads to you recording yourself in your underwear is probably not a good idea.
[0:57:30] <%Calek> Hedron stopped another source of resonance
[0:57:32] <Mendin> Oh god was the hedron "I WAS HOLDING THEM BACK"
[0:57:35] <Mister_McDerp> THE HISS

[0:57:52] <%Calek> Darling did his best, Trench is a dick
[0:57:53] <%QueequegTheater> This game is basically Afghanistan in the 80s
[0:57:54] <+Grayhammatter> fucking thanks darling, we now have the hiss
[0:57:57] <Valdorick> Blue and Red violence is no joke, the race war is deep and complex.

[0:58:42] <Valdorick> So Darling and Jessie are Polaris supporters, and Trench and Dylan are Hiss sympathizers.
[0:58:42] <+zeiss_schreiber> He's ripped for a scientist
[0:58:46] <+Pyroclase> I really appreciate that they didn't go with the obvious twist of "polaris is evil all along"

[1:03:31] <%Conyst> It's probably a really good thing Jesse burned the slides.
[1:03:32] <Valdorick> I mean, of the 4 you guys got a hold of, you brought back 2 old gods... so yeah, why'd she have to burn the other ones.
[1:03:33] <%QueequegTheater> WRONG WAY
[1:03:39] <%joylent_blue> that would've been mega fucked
[1:03:41] <bear_breaker20> would be nuts if darling was an npc too

[1:05:08] <+Snirtax> @AngriestPat Actually burning the slides might have hastened this disaster, since they defaulted to the one with the Hiss in it. Most of the other slides, besides the Not-Mother's, sound less catrastophically lethal

[1:09:30] <%shurtal> I had so much trouble with this part
[1:09:32] <%Teintstein> @firehawk_420 I think they just amplify the resonance and the hiss corrupted them when jesse opened the door

[1:09:54] <%firehawk_420> @teintstein makes sense
[1:10:05] <kartanonperuna> Yeah this part was tough. Mainly because its long and if you die, you have to start all over again
[1:10:06] <%d00msdaydan> hedron being a similar being to the hiss explains why jesse can Control

[1:14:39] <SnaKemuho> at least they take off some enemies off your back for a while
[1:14:40] <beetbo2> Rage piss should be RED like the HISS
[1:14:42] <noobpsyboticus> ideally your piss should be closer to clear
[1:14:48] <%flyingavocad0s> @valdorick That is hedron
[1:15:06] <%starotter70> You'd be pissing blood if you're really angry]
[1:15:08] <bear_breaker20> did he just forget over time that he can dash
[1:15:08] <OldDarkwraith> Yes?
[1:15:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Junior Agent sounds like a title you'd get at Burger King on your birthday.
[1:15:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Strong
[1:15:11] <Caidezes> LUL
[1:15:11] <+Pyroclase> if you throw them right you can trap the bosses under thos esatellite dishes
[1:15:12] <%d00msdaydan> junior agent? you'd think they'd only have their biggest and baddest in this place
[1:15:17] <%Andrizzleton> you have to hit it first before you can throw the dish
[1:15:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats kinda coo
[1:15:19] <Valdorick> Oh, yeah, that makes sense too!
[1:15:20] <%Jrocy247> Can't do cool shit? What a loser
[1:15:24] <kartanonperuna> Damn, 2019 is indeed one of the best years in gaming ever
[1:15:24] <%Starlight_Gamer> that was some tactic

[1:16:23] <%Boscuito> good news is once you do this you kinda got it made
[1:16:32] <noobpsyboticus> do different objects ACTUALLY do different damage in this game? like do bigger objects do more damage?
[1:16:37] <%Boscuito> yes
[1:16:39] <Marpolo13> nailed it
[1:16:47] <kartanonperuna> Theres still a harder bit
[1:16:57] <Marpolo13> stop floating away from me !
[1:16:59] <+Pyroclase> @noobpsyboticus There's a perk that lets you pick up larger objects, and only those do more damage
[1:17:03] <khalcipher> The hardest one!
[1:17:06] <$MachoMadnesss94> @noobpsyboticus i don't think its consistent
[1:17:12] <%Andrizzleton> the ground pound is soo good
[1:17:13] <astrophizz> this part is ultra hard

[1:18:39] <Valdorick> @Sphincter_Spelunker to be fair, that's just what Darling called it because that's how its shaped. Jessie calls her Polaris.

[1:19:47] <FrankysDream> he didnt upgrade his melee attack at all
[1:20:06] <%QueequegTheater> @FrankysDream Because every other ability is better
[1:20:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheBitingIrish because they didn't optimize it properly
[1:20:17] <Mendin> Cant you just rush the siphon and then t hey all die?
[1:20:18] <SnaKemuho> there's so many rays tracing around that even Pat's PC can't handle it

[1:21:41] <noobpsyboticus> @mule4242 that's a good point. Jesse should be able to destroy those lasers easily with mind powers

[1:22:28] <%TheBitingIrish> Tbh I'm not sure what ray tracing looks like. The first time I heard of I just thought 'Oh hey, a new thing that I won't be able to afford for 5-6 years'
[1:22:46] <%unclekulikov> If you are cleansing the siphons, would that make you a... siphon filter?
[1:22:49] <%firehawk_420> I’m gonna make spaghetti for the second time today
[1:22:58] <kartanonperuna> ITs just fancier reflections, nothing ground breaking
[1:23:00] <+RogueMinja> Throw his grenades back for big damage.
[1:23:03] <noobpsyboticus> digital foundry has a great video on it that really shows off the raytracing
[1:23:04] <worldbrand> at least he's not that dangerous alone
[1:23:16] <%floralkami> @pectusumbra how was the story?
[1:23:21] <ミュウレ4242> ray tracing is mostly for simulations. it doesn't make vidya look much better.
[1:23:22] <chrisberm95> Wheres woolie
[1:23:28] <+Pyroclase> @AngriestPat for the next section, try going behind the two big dudes

[1:38:50] <%dukenux> Youre paranoid, Max
[1:38:53] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat remember the note where Jesse and Dylan had conflicting numbers of slides?
[1:38:55] <kartanonperuna> Yeah, lets just say an important mythological figure in Kalevala
[1:38:56] <%zaworldo> ARE WE BACK IN TIME?
[1:38:57] <%Sol_Install> welp he's gone
[1:38:59] <%QueequegTheater> in: Gods, Characters, Kalevala Ahti EDIT @AngriestPat Ahti (sometimes Ahto) is the Finnish god of the sea and fishing. He lives in his underwater palace Ahtola with his wife Vellamo.
[1:39:05] <%NeroInfinite> Trench and by assocation the board got corrupted by the hiss
[1:39:07] <ape_hawk> so, pat, you know how the Hiss give out a distorted look? thats because of the burnt slide they came from!!!
[1:39:16] <%Typhaeon> This is how I feel when I'm doing interval fasting
[1:39:17] <+Bad1uck> big fuck up
[1:39:19] <latgeek> This is BIG magical Alzheimers
[1:39:21] <+STGdirector> you'll hear this shit again if u press X
[1:39:23] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat the burned slide where the hiss lives was the missing slide darling couldn't find
[1:39:27] <%TDotGoat> dicked in the ear
[1:39:27] <SlimeSlimeSlime> "Changing the channels too fast", kids of this age can't relate.
[1:39:28] <+CourageTheCat> MAGIC ALZHIEMERS
[1:39:40] <%dukenux> This feels like the Theme Park level in MP2 all over again @AngriestPat
[1:39:46] <rosemon5001> NIGHT MOTHER will comfort us all push trough the wet.....
[1:39:49] <+TaylOctopus91> "I need scissors, 61!"
[1:39:51] <Clyderso> big TRENCH
[1:39:52] <Valdorick> "With those words, still on my lips... Baby Baby Baby… Yeah."
[1:39:54] <Badgerconda_> This guy? you mean MAX PAYNE!?
[1:39:58] <alexandrecau> loss
[1:40:03] <SnaKemuho> you can feel that this was written by Sam Lake unlike most dialogues in the game
[1:40:04] <%floralkami> YO, can we also get a zoom in on Trench's face? he is emoting aLOT
[1:40:05] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TaylOctopus91 I don't think he is there yet
[1:40:05] <coracor> is this loss?
[1:40:06] <%nyphilem> @AngriestPat so this is what happened to max after max payne 3
[1:40:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SlimeSlimeSlime "it's like when a video has a bunch of mid-rolls in it and you're not using ad block."
[1:40:14] <Cherokia666> No one can Monologue like Max Payne can
[1:40:20] <%zaworldo> OH
[1:40:21] <+CourageTheCat> honestly I hadn't heard ANY of this
[1:40:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> MAX PAYNE
[1:40:22] <%zaworldo> OH WAIT
[1:40:22] <Valdorick> Justin Beiber is a Hiss Agent.

[1:40:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @Sphincter_Spelunker There you go!
[1:40:30] <%waltzqueen> @AngriestPat is Trench emoting?
[1:40:30] <%zaworldo> OH WAIT I JUST SAW THE OBJECTIVE
[1:40:31] <jellssssss20> Gendoh- uh, Trench at least legitimately believed the infecting presence was the other way around, it’s just unfortunate that he was wrong
[1:40:34] <FalseEyeD> He is so lost.
[1:40:36] <Thunder_Poo> 1 hour of dialog
[1:40:38] <%Anime_Flux> Crawling... in my skin.... these wounds... they... will not... heal
[1:40:41] <%zaworldo> WHAT IS H A P P E N I N G
[1:40:43] <noobpsyboticus> he's just fucking monologuing
[1:40:44] <Tucker0603> he was SUPER CORRUPTED
[1:40:45] <%Punchasaur> that's why he called him max...
[1:40:48] <%dukenux> "I was a corporate CEO. Funny enough, it's the worst thing i could imagine."
[1:40:49] <kartanonperuna> @SnaKemuho What makes you think Sam Lake didnt write most of the dialogoue?
[1:40:55] <+Life_Is_WORTHWHILE> Goldman looking ass
[1:40:56] <Varadox> He has a lot of monologue, yes.
[1:40:57] <%blastazoid26> What is he going on about?
[1:41:00] <+zeiss_schreiber> He sounds like the Hiss right now
[1:41:00] <+Zereaux> @AngriestPat would you ever do any VO work?
[1:41:02] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat doesnt the hiss kinda look like burnt plastic or something? like a burnt slide projector?

[1:41:27] <$MachoMadnesss94> @blastazoid26 how he thinks the Hiss is good and Hedron and Darling are bad
[1:41:27] <%Typhaeon> God this is so much better than the same dozen VAs that are in everything else
[1:41:30] <noobpsyboticus> I JUST WANTED TO BECOME AS GODS
[1:41:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat this dialogue might be an hours...

[1:42:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> @ZE_Count he is paid per hour so I guess?
[1:42:11] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat "Ahti (sometimes Ahto) is the Finnish god of the sea and fishing. He lives in his underwater palace Ahtola with his wife Vellamo."

[1:43:18] <%QueequegTheater> Kevin Spacey'lookin ass
[1:43:18] <FrankysDream> Ahti (also known as Ahto) is the god of the water and seas in Finnish mythology. There isn´t much information about Ahti. He was the protector god of fishes, islands, sea birds and all marine life. Fishermen prayed him for good fishing luck

[1:55:36] <%Teintstein> this section has got to be so fucking rough for people that are color blind
[1:55:38] <bear_breaker20> this stage plus combat music is DOOM aesthetic 100%
[1:55:40] <%Punchasaur> why do people feel the need to announce that they're high like it's an accomplishment or badge of honor
[1:55:45] <$MachoMadnesss94> SPIN WITH POWER BOOST

[1:56:23] <%floralkami> @inugamithehound I believe there are filter settings in the menu
[1:56:24] <MrArkannoyed> Pat, why aren't you killing the enemies instead of being killed by them?
[1:56:25] <+CourageTheCat> is there a colorblind setting?
[1:56:26] <%NeroInfinite> MY dogvision
[1:56:34] <Mister_McDerp> the red is starting to hurt my eyes
[1:56:34] <%StaceMcGate> Make sure to rescue the Kitty and bring it to Max's safehouse
[1:56:42] <TheMorilo> This is a good limiters off moment

[1:57:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Hired Goons!

[1:57:42] <%Mr_Strut> I thought the X Files was FBI the Anime
[1:57:43] <%ThatOneGameTester> isn't that also CSI?
[1:57:44] <Clyderso> you mean SWAT CATS
[1:57:44] <Madbearv> Jessie's a teleinetic
[1:57:44] <%waltzqueen> even if dylan breaks out of the hiss he still has trauma out the asshole will be suffering from it for the rest of his life
[1:57:45] <khalcipher> FBC*
[1:57:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this isn't Astral Chain
[1:57:48] <%InugamiTheHound> 5 eps to power up to 100%?
[1:57:49] <Whyverns> what if moulder had anime powers?
[1:57:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> sorta
[1:57:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't forget arrow legion has a faster movement speed
[1:57:51] <Marpolo13> na it would be like astral chain
[1:57:52] <IminyourBase> what if twin peaks fucked x-files
[1:57:52] <%QueequegTheater> @RobotPancake You are watching that
[1:57:54] <Mister_McDerp> I would love an x-files anime
[1:57:56] <IndoorSitup> JESSE: "Dylan, I'm not letting you DIEEEEE."
[1:57:57] <pillowwasp> Looks like the frame rate dimension
[1:57:57] <noobpsyboticus> psycho pass
[1:58:03] <%starotter70> Anybody remember that MIB cartoon?
[1:58:06] <+ebrion> psycho pass
[1:58:09] <%1matheuw> do your legion trigger pat
[1:58:10] <ivansonic08> X-Files is a 90's FBI anime, Control is modern anime FBI
[1:58:10] <%RobotPancake> @queequegtheater you right lol
[1:58:12] <%InugamiTheHound> @Clyderso yeah I love swat kats
[1:58:16] <+Zereaux> whats that effect called the one that all over the screen rn?
[1:58:18] <%Punchasaur> anime wishes it had writing this good
[1:58:20] <%transporterthesequel> I like that the board is helping you get there like, physically
[1:58:26] <Marpolo13> @starotter70 vaguely but yea
[1:58:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Step into the FBC, there's lots to do and lots to be
[1:58:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use Dog Legion to see invisible enemies
[1:58:30] <%waltzqueen> It looks like youre walking on a world made of Galena
[1:58:35] <Animorphimagi> I mean this IS KINDA like Psycho Pass
[1:58:35] <%TaifuDragon> chromatic aberration
[1:58:38] <gazingeye1> Since The Board has such a problem with the Hiss infecting them....i wonder what their opinion is on The Director being infected with Polaris?
[1:58:40] <%starotter70> @Marpolo13 All I remember is the OP
[1:58:43] <%Razputin217> FUCK THAT INVISIBLE FUCK
[1:58:49] <%Undenizen> something i realized way too late: you can still hit the bloodstarved while they're invisible
[1:58:50] <%Punchasaur> @zereaux it's called the color red
[1:58:51] <RupanSen> the screamlords
[1:58:58] <%Ascethetic> BOR TO DIE
[1:58:59] <Marpolo13> @starotter70 lol pretty much same here
[1:59:00] <+xXichibanballer> the MiB cartoon had a cool ass intro. That's about all I remember
[1:59:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> I need to watch psycho pass espeicaly the fan movie edit
[1:59:13] <pillowwasp> If your dimension is red you’re better off dead
[1:59:14] <worldbrand> this is what using fl.ux looks like to me
[1:59:21] <%Starlight_Gamer> is this the infinite forest?
[1:59:24] <%StaceMcGate> I think this dimension needs like 30% more red, not red enough
[1:59:25] <+AltunRes> wow that sky is fucked up
[1:59:25] <Caidezes> I can barely tell what's happening.
[1:59:25] <%Shadicara> Some real psychic bullshit here
[1:59:26] <Angry_Ev1L> not gonna lie this red destroys my fucking eyes lol
[1:59:31] <%Ascethetic> all this red is hurting my eyes
[1:59:36] <%Undenizen> Pat! Defeat the communist dimension!
[1:59:38] <Marpolo13> ya
[1:59:38] <%MasterDecoder> @Starlight_Gamer No
[1:59:40] <$drfaustisdead> oh well I'll watch the vod, but I'm going to assume the Ashtray Maze was muted.
[1:59:43] <%merylinspants> this shit is so hard to focus on lol
[1:59:49] <IminyourBase> drop your shield!
[1:59:49] <%QueequegTheater> @drfaustisdead probably not
[1:59:54] <%1matheuw> use axe legin to block attacks
[1:59:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @drfaustisdead it was NOT
[1:59:56] <godzookylives> it's like I'm watching Mandy
[1:59:57] <Mister_McDerp> RED GO AWAY
[1:59:58] <%flyingavocad0s> I don't remember this much red
[1:59:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat please. they're vampires
[2:00:00] <%Shadicara> Welcome to the red zone
[2:00:00] <%Undenizen> oh yeah how was the ashtray maze? I missed it
[2:00:00] <Djinnazz> @merylinspants nope.
[2:00:02] <%Zombrocom> Yeah the pure red is kinda hard to look at
[2:00:02] <%ClericOfSparda> They're vampires
[2:00:06] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> zombie ghosts leave this place
[2:00:10] <%NeroInfinite> energy vampires
[2:00:11] <Dreigun> my house looks green now after staring at this red environment so long
[2:00:12] <%zaworldo> Ashtray maze was dope as fuck
[2:00:15] <TheMorilo> Man this is hissed as fuck
[2:00:16] <%StaceMcGate> Better Dead Than Red
[2:00:20] <Marpolo13> nop
[2:00:21] <%Punchasaur> this is like what my brother's room looked like as a teenager
[2:00:22] <%merylinspants> @Djinnazz i mean color wise but ok
[2:00:23] <%Shadicara> Bio vampires
[2:00:24] <noobpsyboticus> they are more like thralls tbh
[2:00:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> This is so much red it's actually hurting my eyes
[2:00:26] <Cherokia666> There was NO TIME
[2:00:27] <pillowwasp> This is..... mementos
[2:00:28] <%skizzuto> it wasn't endgame
[2:00:29] <ape_hawk> the board are just upper management
[2:00:30] <+ebrion> that gun is super powerful right now
[2:00:34] <%NeroInfinite> They didn't have a director and there was no time
[2:00:35] <Graxe_> Not until Endgame
[2:00:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat not when you were in the realworld/old house
[2:00:36] <Animorphimagi> ?
[2:00:37] <%zaworldo> endgame is only NOW
[2:00:38] <$drfaustisdead> Awesome. Thanks for the heads up.
[2:00:39] <%dalmek> they had to file paperwork
[2:00:39] <bear_breaker20> nonbio vampires?
[2:00:40] <+CourageTheCat> when has the board ever made sense
[2:00:41] <%Rumbutt> probably makes them vulnerable in some way?
[2:00:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is the Plane
[2:00:45] <%Teintstein> I'm guessing that they can only power you up when you're in the astral plane?
[2:00:46] <Graxe_> This is Endgame Protocol
[2:00:46] <khalcipher> Remember fo fly
[2:00:48] <SnaKemuho> maybe they have more important business to attend to
[2:00:49] <Marpolo13> if they COULD have we wouldn't have a game then
[2:00:49] <%Undenizen> I don't think the board were expecting a direct attack
[2:00:50] <%shurtal> Even interdimensional being need robot hands
[2:00:52] <Clowns> maybe it costs them something to do it, and since they're in the middle of dying...
[2:00:52] <%NeroInfinite> Trench was corrupted
[2:00:53] <%floralkami> @angriestpat can you show off the game's filter settings after this fight, please? this red is really hurting chat's eyes
[2:00:56] <BioStormX> you can't take off the limiters willy nilly that's too dangerous
[2:00:59] <%xcompleasedad> Nope. Too much OP makes you vulernable to the HISS
[2:01:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think they needed to have Jesse come along as a representative or an avatar
[2:01:04] <%Shadicara> Pat that's literally a megabuster
[2:01:04] <%Koosahmii> Ever known any Board to be effective?
[2:01:09] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat Dylan just started attacking them
[2:01:10] <%StaceMcGate> Doktor, release my pain inhibitors
[2:01:14] <%shurtal> Gotta Telecommute
[2:01:15] <chaos2frozen> upper management never acts on time
[2:01:15] <%Punchasaur> Jesse wasn't ready
[2:01:18] <%Dr_DangerPhD> shareholders get pissed off every time the limiters are released
[2:01:18] <%ryome> Pat, you were their plan
[2:01:21] <$MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat you forget the Board's number one rule: DO NOT GET HYPE
[2:01:21] <%NeroInfinite> man all this readhurts my eyes
[2:01:23] <khalcipher> Telekinesis for shield gun for HP
[2:01:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @StaceMcGate YOUR MEMES END HERE
[2:01:25] <+ViperMrk6> Has pat used ground pound against enemies even once?
[2:01:25] <+CourageTheCat> they didn't want u to get northmoor'd
[2:01:26] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> this is a hell of a shooting gallery
[2:01:27] <TheMorilo> This is a bitrate murder
[2:01:27] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat would the shotgun help with this?
[2:01:38] <Marpolo13> reds starting to get to me now
[2:01:38] <$MachoMadnesss94> DO NOT GET HYPE
[2:01:40] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat TBF it looks like the Hiss only just recently infiltrated the Astral Plane.
[2:01:41] <Djinnazz> Their middle management, of course they're incompetent.
[2:01:43] <%zaworldo> It isn't upgraded
[2:01:43] <%QueequegTheater> @Ascethetic no, it fires too slowly
[2:01:45] <%abakkus> red means scary
[2:01:46] <%StaceMcGate> Looks like its time for Jesse... to let er rip
[2:01:48] <SlimeSlimeSlime> D-Dawg, you there?
[2:01:51] <%Zombrocom> There is a ground pound?
[2:01:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is this a virtual boy title?
[2:01:54] <%Ascethetic> @QueequegTheater ah, thats too bad
[2:01:59] <+purps26> this combat section aint that great
[2:02:01] <%waltzqueen> no esseJ outfit?
[2:02:01] <%Undenizen> this is the virtual boy.
[2:02:03] <%Diabetic> Odin and Loki will save you, oh wait, they're up in a Washington town rehearsing music
[2:02:09] <Mister_McDerp> a shitty pyramid
[2:02:09] <%Meidolaon> Meidolaon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Oh hey, 28 months of Pat going out of CONTROL! By the way, Woolie was super right, Sakura Wars DOES have an anime too. It just started off as a strategy RPG. Whoops.
[2:02:11] <%StaceMcGate> and that was the final boss... goodbye
[2:02:11] <SnaKemuho> wish there was a boss like in side quests here
[2:02:13] <Marpolo13> pyramids confirmed evil

[2:10:34] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat The DLC is a ways off and spread out pretty well, which tells me they're gonna be pretty lengthy.
[2:10:36] <iswearimjustdandy> Shes such a dork
[2:10:37] <worldbrand> good for her
[2:10:39] <%Hydrapissed> emily secret BOSS
[2:10:40] <%1matheuw> thats sounds like is going to end bad
[2:10:42] <%StaceMcGate> why does the elmo scream so? @AngriestPat
[2:10:44] <ape_hawk> "youre... kinda the only person in your department, anyway...."
[2:10:44] <%Teintstein> notice that almost all the characters you talk to are basically the new management
[2:10:44] <%Hydrapissed> Dun Dun Dunnnn
[2:10:50] <Mendin> Suddenly Darling falls out of the Hedron Dimensions screaming "YOU'D BETTER NOT TOUCH MY FUCKING SAND"
[2:10:50] <%floralkami> yo, i really want to see how Emily's outfit looks without the HRA, it looks like it has a really unique shirt
[2:10:52] <kartanonperuna> Yeah, the expansions seem promising.
[2:10:52] <+MediocreHermits> did he go into the moss hole ?
[2:10:53] <$MachoMadnesss94> yeah DUH
[2:10:55] <%Spydurman> Honestly think it's super cool this ends with the Agency ran by a pair of kickass women
[2:11:00] <Animorphimagi> Pope is just as extreme as Darling
[2:11:05] <pillowwasp> No shit
[2:11:06] <ekkieekk> The dude in containment also has more dialogue
[2:11:13] <Dio_TR> GIRL POWER
[2:11:19] <ExpressNode> Those purrs are loud
[2:11:24] <%StaceMcGate> Darling as a boss in DLC
[2:11:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Make new mistakes. Don't repeat old ones.
[2:11:30] <%starotter70> Does Ahti have anything to say?
[2:11:32] <%Hydrapissed> uh oh sounds like trench
[2:11:33] <%Hydrapissed> btw
[2:11:36] <noobpsyboticus> her mouth still weirds me out
[2:11:37] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> “How do I feel about me taking over as Director, person whom I just promoted?”
[2:11:37] <Mister_McDerp> Darling was cool though
[2:11:38] <%InugamiTheHound> the hiss made him a asshole
[2:11:38] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> getting cocky
[2:11:41] <$MachoMadnesss94> remember when Pope had a huge boner for manufacturing weapons out of black rock... she seems unstable
[2:11:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Management always wants to shake things up
[2:11:41] <%Teintstein> @starotter70 Ahti is on vacation
[2:11:42] <SnaKemuho> Darling as a sidekick in DLC
[2:11:45] <khalcipher> The boss of the panopticon has more dialoge too!
[2:11:49] <ZE_Count> Langstrom got new convo too.
[2:11:50] <%starotter70> @Teintstein Well Deserved
[2:11:52] <Djinnazz> AAhti's still on vaation.
[2:11:55] <OhioNitsud> darling ran off to start his own 80s cover band
[2:11:55] <ミュウレ4242> trench was corrupted first. darling was an asshole, then corrupted by good.

[2:13:26] <OhioNitsud> bedpan his face
[2:13:28] <Mister_McDerp> Hedron is best girl
[2:13:29] <%1matheuw> they seem to have the gay
[2:13:31] <iswearimjustdandy> @sabiscotti absolutely

[2:13:42] <%Piemen99> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:13:45] <%pectusumbra> awww, i missed the xlimax
[2:13:57] <%floralkami> LUL they did great work on these facial rigs, fuck what yall think
[2:13:59] <SnaKemuho> so, were Dylan and Jesse the same person or not, did they leave it for DLC?
[2:14:05] <iswearimjustdandy> @valdorick you are right @angriestpat ahti is best girl
[2:14:07] <SABiscotti> @iswearimjustdandy Awesome
[2:14:10] <%luckysteak> this is quite the revelation
[2:14:12] <%Calek> they're not the same person
[2:14:18] <kartanonperuna> Yeah, I dont know why people shit on the faces. the facial animations are very good
[2:14:20] <chaos2frozen> Underhill has unique dialogues as well
[2:14:24] <%Koosahmii> They really were there!
[2:14:28] <chaos2frozen> Moud Lady
[2:14:32] <%StaceMcGate> Elder God Confirmed
[2:14:32] <gazingeye1> Just like the Hiss and Dylan.....
[2:14:39] <%Razputin217> BECOME AS GODS
[2:14:40] <SpellCatty> wait what'd I miss is Polaris okay
[2:14:44] <+CourageTheCat> that is a GLARING WEAKNESS in a company-wide protective measure
[2:14:45] <%Typhaeon> It's mostly because when you have super-realistic faces with fairly basic animations it looks off.
[2:14:47] <%dalmek> so Jesse now powers the HRA
[2:14:48] <Marpolo13> so we are the new elder god?
[2:14:48] <%Divryne> MEEE?!
[2:14:51] <%flyingavocad0s> You are literally the only thing keeping this place together
[2:14:51] <%Punchasaur> just googled it, no control hentai :(
[2:14:52] <%dalmek> aka if she dies, everything is fucked again
[2:14:53] <%NeroInfinite> Jesse ispolaris now
[2:14:54] <$GoogleyGareth> She's literally keeping them on
[2:14:56] <%Hydrapissed> her STAND
[2:15:04] <+Zereaux> pat=polaris?
[2:15:04] <Valdorick> Move aside Old Gods - its NEW GODS TIME!
[2:15:05] <%Typhaeon> You would need to put in painstaking detail down to microexpressions to make it less odd
[2:15:06] <Marpolo13> so kill everything? sounds good to me
[2:15:10] <%Agami23> @SpellCatty polaris is either dead, or her mom is dead and polaris is a baby god
[2:15:10] <Rosy_Joan> @kartanonperuna Popes animations are really good but I think most people are looking at eyebrows grimace man out in the hallway
[2:15:14] <%Ion_Laser> @Punchasaur Not with that attitude!
[2:15:18] <Mister_McDerp> What happens if Jesse dies? Are they fucked then?
[2:15:18] <iswearimjustdandy> @punchasaur be the change you want to see in the world
[2:15:18] <$MachoMadnesss94> @SpellCatty Polaris is, Hedron isn't. Polaris is a piece of Hedron that survives inside Jesse's head.
[2:15:20] <+nekodelic> what do they eat?
[2:15:22] <%42nfl19> THE ASTRAL CHAIN?
[2:15:23] <kartanonperuna> I think the expressions arent that basic. They are very xomplex at points
[2:15:24] <+OkamiDude15> so when is jesse gonna get her legion?
[2:15:28] <TheMorilo> FORMER
[2:15:33] <%Teintstein> which controls the oldest house
[2:15:34] <kartanonperuna> Arish looks terrible, I admit
[2:15:37] <powerprotoman> their goal was sick ghost stands with devil trigger powers
[2:15:39] <%StaceMcGate> Darling is chilling with Yoseph, just contemplating 3rd impact stuff
[2:15:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> make the hiss into cop slaves
[2:15:43] <chaos2frozen> Literal Corporate takeover
[2:15:43] <%ChaosAethr> Control 2?
[2:15:47] <%Big_Dream> The former got fired started the hiss and tried a hostile take over
[2:15:58] <%Monkeyweed21> go do the Fridge
[2:15:59] <Tucker0603> AHTI!!!
[2:16:01] <%1matheuw> electric bugaloo
[2:16:04] <%firehawk_420> Arish looks like a real person. I went to school with a kid that looks exactly like him.
[2:16:05] <TheMorilo> "yeah, let's not investigate the forces that govern us" great idea
[2:16:07] <+Zereaux> AHTI?
[2:16:09] <%Teintstein> @Monkeyweed21 he's done the fridge already
[2:16:15] <%Punchasaur> although the actress who played Jesse did porn briefly

[2:16:28] <Rosy_Joan> Control 2 is when they use Astral devices to enslave hiss demons and give them to police.
[2:16:30] <%Zombrocom> "Endless Grind" thats on the nose
[2:16:32] <Graxe_> Endless grind

[2:16:40] <%floralkami> @themorilo did you learn nothing from this game?

[2:17:00] <Valdorick> Trench, no one wanted to hear your slam poetry when you were alive; they don't want to hear it now.
[2:17:01] <+Bad1uck> @Animorphimagi They're not. They are entities from other dimmensions
[2:17:06] <$rytyoung> check the amazing message from the board!
[2:17:09] <+CourageTheCat> FeelsBadMan

[2:22:02] <%Ion_Laser> Welcome to the FBC! Where you get to work on [REDACTED]
[2:22:02] <ミュウレ4242> they can just recruit from other government agencies. put something weird in their fridge, see if they notice.
[2:22:06] <%Jrocy247> How come that you became the Boss of the company, you get the lamest Old Person Haircut?
[2:22:16] <noobpsyboticus> @screamlord why bother asking questions about basic stuff that you have no context for? it's like coming into a movie half at through and going "who's that? what's going on?"
[2:22:18] <%Teintstein> there's a hidden area over by ahti's office, but ya - he's not there for dialogue
[2:22:19] <%waltzqueen> I'll sign up for SCP duty if i get enough money and out of retail
[2:22:24] <iswearimjustdandy> Chat: fbc job or retail?
[2:22:28] <ape_hawk> langstons an alright guy

[2:22:35] <worldbrand> that was pretty honest
[2:22:36] <%Monkeyweed21> FBC by far
[2:22:36] <%waltzqueen> FBC
[2:22:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's actually a good bit of advise. Well done.
[2:22:37] <%Ion_Laser> fbc

[2:23:47] <Louie_Salmon> You're just gonna shit standing?

[2:23:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> moozik
[2:23:51] <Coystick> Come back don't you walk away from meeeEEEE
[2:23:54] <IndoorSitup> BRASS FEMUR TIME
[2:23:55] <Marpolo13> We didn't eat any mold though :(
[2:24:02] <+mesuking1> dang did i miss the stream
[2:24:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> just a classic walking shit
[2:24:04] <bear_breaker20> Kreygasm <==3
[2:24:08] <$MachoMadnesss94> the "Be Right Back" screen should just be Dynamite from now on
[2:24:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> What IS this song?
[2:24:10] <Funkyfjord> chat, no spoilers, where we at in blasphemous
[2:24:13] <iswearimjustdandy> Im not caught up of blasphemous so bye guys!
[2:24:13] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Bless? The MMO?
[2:24:28] <%Roasted_Pheasant> No Bless the rapper
[2:24:29] <%starotter70> @mesuking1 You missed Control. Break now, then Blasphemous
[2:24:31] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Oh, “Blasphemous.”
[2:24:35] <%Ranryu692> there are spoilers for blashphemous? That game seemed like its plot didn't matter
[2:24:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> srsly tho, am I the only one who didn't realize Elmo had a box cutter
[2:24:41] <IndoorSitup> TIME FOR SOME BRASS FEMURS
[2:24:46] <%Undenizen> welp, I beat the game before Pat by about 30 minutes. Sadly, this means I could not be hype with him for the ashtray maze.
[2:24:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> This game has me super interested, I adore the world and the tone. Everyone keeps saying its SCP, but I looked into the surface stuff for it and it isn't quite this tone. Is it given its unique flair by the Alan Wake writer?
[2:24:51] <ivansonic08> DUM DUM ba dum dum dum ba dum dum
[2:24:53] <+rosa_buttsemburg> where is he in blasphemous
[2:24:59] <Funkyfjord> ya i mean it doesn't have much of a plot, just wondering what area pat's at
[2:24:59] <+mesuking1> @starotter70 ok cool. i wanted to avoid control spoielrs anyway.
[2:25:00] <%Punchasaur> back to monhun for me
[2:25:02] <%Typhaeon> Spoiler: Guilt is part of a balanced diet
[2:25:18] <T_Sasquatch> @rumtumtugnutz i JUST noticed
[2:25:29] <%Typhaeon> He was past Our Lady a bit
[2:25:31] <%Undenizen> @Jack_of_No_Trades the problem with SCP is it's a collaborative writing project. This game is like the idealized version.
[2:25:36] <Funkyfjord> favorite description of blasphemous "more catholic than mass"
[2:25:44] <Funkyfjord> thanks typhaeon
[2:25:48] <%Piemen99> Nice
[2:25:51] <%starotter70> Just looked it up again, that MiB Cartoon OP still kicks ass
[2:25:57] <%TheBitingIrish> A 'Catholvania'
[2:26:01] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @Undenizen I see, I guess that just means I am gonna be excited for DLC/sequels.
[2:26:03] <%Typhaeon> Just into Mercy Dreams I think
[2:26:29] <%firehawk_420> I’m gonna go cuddle with fulgur anjy
[2:26:34] <imquotin> fellas did Pat start playing Blasphemous yet? I just tuned in
[2:26:42] <%firehawk_420> And by cuddle I mean break his stupid face
[2:26:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> No whats the music tho
[2:26:50] <%StaceMcGate> Pat has completed two challenges and is moving onto the 3rd in Blasphemous iirc
[2:26:55] <%SoySocks> this song is so catchy
[2:26:59] <%starotter70> @imquotin Nope just about to
[2:26:59] <imquotin> thanks pal
[2:27:07] <%Undenizen> @Jack_of_No_Trades you might also like Kafka, but he's less supernatural, more HYPER OPRESSION
[2:27:12] <%galaxyswirl> this song reminds me of PSO
[2:27:19] <%Typhaeon> Ah, must have done the second after I went to bed
[2:27:27] <%MasterDecoder> @Roasted_Pheasant Mobile or desktop Twitch, cause scroll down
[2:27:31] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Oh, look up the secret gun ipgrade when you get time, it's DUPER cool.
[2:27:40] <ittla> hey pat how you doin
[2:27:41] <%starotter70> A screaming Pillow
[2:27:43] <+Deathtronhammer> Elmopillow
[2:27:43] <+Ell1ot> Whaaaat is this game?
[2:27:43] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Oh really? Neat
[2:27:44] <Triplicat> what the fuck is with blasphemerman's hat
[2:27:44] <%StaceMcGate> Send Elmo to college
[2:27:45] <%arancet> pillow son?
[2:27:45] <%Meidolaon> Floofiest son
[2:27:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @Undenizen Is Kafka the "I woke up a bug" guy?
[2:27:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pillow Son
[2:27:47] <%jeffishype> He is in-fact, a good boy
[2:27:50] <%Agami23> a pillow who scream?
[2:27:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Time to blast some phemours.
[2:27:51] <%CherrieVelvet> a cloud pillow
[2:27:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> he is in fact a pillow
[2:27:51] <+Pyroclase> @Djinnazz I have beaten the game and haven't heard about a secret gun upgrade
[2:27:52] <Triplicat> is he a unicorn
[2:27:55] <Mendin> This game is Spanish Catholic Bloodborne Metroidvania
[2:27:55] <IminyourBase> is elmo an OOP?
[2:28:02] <katocrimson> castlevania souls
[2:28:07] <%Undenizen> @AngriestPat I know nothing about BLASPHEMOUS. tell us your knowledge.
[2:28:08] <%Meidolaon> I wonder if Pat will do Daemon X Machina?
[2:28:09] <+rosa_buttsemburg> if you play this game you get excommunicated from the catholic church in real life
[2:28:09] <%ChaosAethr> Elmo Is cosplaying a pillow
[2:28:10] <+OkamiDude15> pat himself is an OOP
[2:28:10] <%starotter70> Yeah?
[2:28:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 21 months! Literally just crossed the border from my first trip into Canada, visited a friend in Fredricton. In my entire three day stay, I couldn't muscle up the courage to try poutine. Maybe next time.
[2:28:10] <%jeffishype> Now, time for something completely different
[2:28:12] <deviljhojho94> words
[2:28:14] <%starotter70> Sing our thanks
[2:28:14] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat We can probably visit the other NPCs when the DLC comes around.
[2:28:15] <%joylent_blue> talking
[2:28:15] <haisho> his hat shall pierce the heavens
[2:28:16] <%MasterDecoder> @Roasted_Pheasant F1NG3RS on Youtube does the music
[2:28:16] <%Undenizen> @Jack_of_No_Trades the very same.
[2:28:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> screaming elmo is a killer band name
[2:28:20] <%hntronium> Time to blaspheme
[2:28:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> kotaku?
[2:28:36] <%SoySocks> @Roasted_Pheasant i believe you were asking about the brb song? it's "Boot Loop" by F1NG3RS
[2:28:46] <+mystillweather> @roasted_pheasant boot loop by F1NG3RS. It’s neat
[2:28:48] <noobpsyboticus> @commandersqueaks why does it take courage to try poutine?
[2:28:51] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> the 5s don't matter either
[2:28:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @Undenizen That's all I ever heard about him, so if he has a bit of that tone I like with weird stuff like that I may give him a shot
[2:28:57] <IminyourBase> 20, 3rd birthday
[2:29:01] <%jeffishype> Nothing special about turning and 10 and 15, nerd

[2:29:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @cereal_box_conspiracy you're more than 90?
[2:29:58] <%starotter70> Thanks man
[2:29:58] <+Deathtronhammer> What about TG Cid in 14?
[2:30:01] <Valdorick> I view the birthdays that make you feel oldest by virtue of being able to compare your age to a century most important. For example - 25 is 1/4 of a century, 33 is 1/3, 50 is 1/2
[2:30:07] <%Undenizen> @Jack_of_No_Trades I actually haven't read him, but I hear he's a major influence for SCP as well. I have a book called 'The Trial' about a guy who finds out he's on trial for a crime he knows nothing about and he's not allowed to attend.
[2:30:07] <+Pyroclase> that dance
[2:30:08] <+Ell1ot> you did it

[2:36:09] <%Jrocy247> Speaking of Jesus

[2:36:26] <%mesuking1> This game is metal AF
[2:36:29] <%Undenizen> you couldn't have gotten him down?
[2:36:34] <%joylent_blue> because the bible tells him so
[2:36:34] <AMaidIndeed> Jesus loves me this I know BECAUSE IT'S WHAT THE SOURCE CODE TELLS ME SO
[2:36:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Going to BURNING man
[2:36:35] <Valdorick> Its fine Pat, he played FF14 on a satellite Wireless connection.
[2:36:37] <%dukenux> That's a minotaur
[2:36:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think a quick death by sword is prefferable to burning alive.
[2:36:38] <+Son_of_Ssapo> @Undenizen They reference Calvary at one point, that's super close
[2:36:38] <%hussdogrob> Jesus hates you this we know, for Jesus just told you so!!
[2:36:40] <%Laecerelius> DIE, MELEE DEMON!
[2:36:40] <Mendin> Oh yeah give me those spanish guitar diablo-esque riffs
[2:36:43] <%TheBitingIrish> TAKE A SHOWER, S T I N K Y
[2:36:43] <haisho> what is this Blighttown energy
[2:36:45] <sakeydo> He seems mildly familiar, how cold is Pat going in?
[2:36:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Funfact: Purple's elite status stems from the rarity and cost of the dye originally used to produce it. The color purple has been associated with royalty, power and wealth for centuries. In fact, Queen Elizabeth I forbade anyone except close members of the royal family to wear it.
[2:36:55] <%arcaderabbit48> This looks like a really nice Sega Genesis game. Like you know how everyone is obsessed with looking like a good SNES game? This is that for Genesis
[2:36:59] <Mendin> he played for 4 hours last ni ght sakeydo
[2:37:02] <%starotter70> @sakeydo He did a stream earlier

[2:37:21] <JackaxeAM> Also cause of that one dude's poop
[2:37:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat It was a rare color to find thus expensive
[2:37:21] <%joylent_blue> purple also gay
[2:37:22] <%SoySocks> both purple and blue were hard to dye, until they found easy blue, then it wasn't royal anymore
[2:37:22] <+DrTribal> HI PAT YOU CRAZY MAN
[2:37:23] <+Walopoh> Because they get the dye from deep ocean oysters, super expensive
[2:37:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Purple is one of my favourite colours.
[2:37:24] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> It dates back to the ancient Romans.
[2:37:26] <Kristoffers> hard to like, too Kappa
[2:37:26] <laguerrilha> bishops use it right?
[2:37:26] <%Laecerelius> Purple also = Donatello
[2:37:28] <LodiFrostbeard> you have to pee on snails to get purple dye
[2:37:28] <%Mr_Strut> You're from a family of drunks
[2:37:30] <+OkamiDude15> pat of house boivin
[2:37:30] <IndoorSitup> @firearmsinstructor So drinking Purple Drank makes me royalty?
[2:37:30] <%starotter70> @dalmek Night
[2:37:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> but the first artifical dye was PURPLE
[2:37:32] <D3va> rbzWhat atpCap
[2:37:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Purple WAS hard to dye, until that one guy came along and figured a way to make it cheap, devaluing all purple overnight
[2:37:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> @IndoorSitup yup
[2:37:43] <%dukenux> Purple in the ancient times was made of some rare sea slug shells
[2:37:44] <noobpsyboticus> more like no-bull
[2:37:47] <gonzy92> ancient Greece or Rome use to kill millions of snails to make purple
[2:37:47] <+rosa_buttsemburg> did pat do the mountains without doing the cistern?
[2:37:48] <LaughingCatt> medieval purple & blue are hard to make dyes for > purple & blue dye is expensive > only used by rich people like royalty
[2:37:50] <%joylent_blue> purple is superior to many colors
[2:37:52] <%FirearmsInstructor> @IndoorSitup but only on the inside, so no one else knows
[2:37:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Roasted_Pheasant he found it out on accident
[2:37:55] <+Estuko> Was that just DugTrio but, humans
[2:37:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> purple still has value as the coolest color
[2:37:56] <IndoorSitup> I want that Purple Stuff.
[2:37:58] <chambatron> I can't believe this game OMG it looks so freaking good
[2:37:58] <%CalderGaming> I see pat is purple now
[2:38:01] <%dukenux> its one of the resources Phoenicians traded in extensively
[2:38:02] <wheke_> like g a m e c u b e purple?
[2:38:03] <%Undenizen> @laguerrilha and sometimes cardinals, I think
[2:38:03] <Hyp3r4ctive> purple is a weird colour because it doesn't exactly exist on the colour spectrum. indigo is at the bottom, but it's very dark
[2:38:09] <%FirearmsInstructor> @IndoorSitup and if you try to tell anyone else you can't prove it unless you show them by showing them your insides
[2:38:11] <+JacktheMan18> Nice shoryuken
[2:38:11] <Valdorick> Purple is also just rad, because its ultimate melding color of cools and warms Kappa
[2:38:14] <T_Sasquatch> im confused, the fame has skins ?
[2:38:20] <%dukenux> and in Ancient Rome purple color was basicly reserved to the rulling class
[2:38:21] <%Undenizen> @Hyp3r4ctive that's Pink. purple exists.
[2:38:21] <+Walopoh> @AngriestPat The only way to get purple dye was from oysters, which is why it was so expensive then
[2:38:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> squish
[2:38:22] <T_Sasquatch> game*
[2:38:23] <chambatron> Oof
[2:38:31] <$KevGuuey> Did you say purple is hobo?
[2:38:31] <%Typhaeon> The head pop is more satifsying than the actual exectuion on that enemy
[2:38:34] <katocrimson> there some colorblind people that can't see purple
[2:38:37] <%valriot> Hey @angriestpat A new Battlestar Galactic show is being made
[2:38:39] <%42nfl19> So I missed the first stream but what is @AngriestPat 's goal for this game? Does he want to kill god or revive god or something?
[2:38:40] <%starotter70> I wanna get this game so bad, but I gotta have SOME restraint
[2:38:44] <noobpsyboticus> this game looks incredible but metal slug is still better imo
[2:38:45] <%Ranryu692> I forgot: the only trailer they played before Promare was for the next Shantae game. Trigger made that trailer
[2:38:48] <%grayjammer> Uh oh, Cisterns!
[2:38:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> technically violet is what doesnt exist, purple is really closer to red as a pigment than it is as short a wavelength as violet
[2:38:49] <%hussdogrob> purple is the best of both worlds according to videogames like astral chain
[2:38:49] <IndoorSitup> Am I the only one here who's seen that Chapelle bit about Purple Stuff?
[2:38:51] <+Pyroclase> I have no idea what's going on in this game.
[2:38:53] <Mendin> @42nfl19 God only knows
[2:38:56] <%arcaderabbit48> @Walopoh I had no idea that's where they got it from. Thank you, that's actually very good to know
[2:38:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> how the fuck you get purple from oysters?
[2:39:03] <%Undenizen> @AngriestPat yeah so what are you actually trying to do in this game anyway?
[2:39:18] <+DrTribal> NO
[2:39:19] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @King_Wolf_Rigger Prolly blood and juices
[2:39:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No u
[2:39:20] <bear_breaker20> because whats needed to make purple dyes was harder to come by or cause royals were autists for style?
[2:39:21] <+DrTribal> I already did
[2:39:23] <%dukenux> It's a distinct species of a sea oyster(clam?_
[2:39:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @DrTribal *high five*
[2:39:33] <+Walopoh> @arcaderabbit48 np it's one of my favorite things to mention whenever someone brings it up
[2:39:36] <Mendin> I -beat- the game and I'm still not solid on exactly how everything goes plotwise
[2:39:38] <%Laecerelius> I'm sure it'll somehow get grosser
[2:39:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> oysters arent rare, they're HARD AS SHIT To farm
[2:39:42] <%FrostMass22> @king_wolf_rigger You ask nicely
[2:39:45] <Valdorick> Well, you got greens and blues by crushing up gems, so yeah, purple coming from seashells isn't too shocking.
[2:39:47] <Hyp3r4ctive> @Undenizen can look at the wiki page, purple is a weird misbehaviour in the colour spectrum
[2:39:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Roasted_Pheasant Mmm, my favourite way to dye things.
[2:39:56] <Hyp3r4ctive> specifically how our eyes perceive red and blue
[2:39:57] <%Undenizen> @Mendin is it a dark souls?
[2:40:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat BOOO
[2:40:08] <%joylent_blue> literally crushing them
[2:40:09] <%Laecerelius> Crushinator!
[2:40:10] <juxtest> hyuk hyuk
[2:40:11] <worldbrand> I'm a little jealous
[2:40:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> enjoy picking up oysters in 5 feet water under hot sun?
[2:40:15] <%starotter70> I am too
[2:40:16] <IshikawaKenji> this looks like dead cells
[2:40:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FrostMass22 Nuh-uh. don't wanna
[2:40:17] <Valdorick> "I want to paint a blue dress, get me the royal sapphires!"
[2:40:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Hyp3r4ctive kinda its no different then most colors we see
[2:40:21] <%joylent_blue> PogChamp

[2:40:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dukenux untill we found Indigo
[2:40:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You would know about disgusting gas.
[2:41:01] <worldbrand> disgrossting
[2:41:03] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why do all the shield guys now require crushing Weren't you just stabbing them to death before? Are they getting stronger / harder? Or are you in a different area?
[2:41:04] <+Walopoh> Did you know that they used to grind up ancient Egyptian mummies in Europe to get certain shades of color for paintings?
[2:41:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Nice shot
[2:41:08] <%floralkami> @theslothcast wait a bit
[2:41:10] <%joylent_blue> nothing :)

[2:41:16] <worldbrand> what's more catholic than fart gas?
[2:41:18] <%KoyaMusa> the reward from getting 20 babies is pretty alright, wish the bones gave something more tangible
[2:41:22] <LaughingCatt> the fart gas OF SIN
[2:41:26] <GiygasDrillBreak> that's my mummy for eating
[2:41:31] <+OkamiDude15> that one door at the beginning of the game just unlocked Kappa

[2:41:44] <+Audega> Is this a video game?
[2:41:47] <Mendin> The 20 baby reward unlocks a big lateral-thinking gimmick
[2:41:47] <%Punchasaur> is this a dead cells?
[2:41:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Roasted_Pheasant D:
[2:41:53] <+OkamiDude15> @Audega perhaps

[2:44:51] <Pyrrhus90> he wants to play with his food LUL
[2:44:59] <%arcaderabbit48> @jacob2pop Yeah, that's true. I just hope this si the game's Blight analogue, because I really hate those areas and this is pretty tame
[2:45:00] <%ThatOneGameTester> That's cat owner language for he wants to kill something on the screen
[2:45:03] <haisho> TV is big and strong
[2:45:04] <sakeydo> must be a big ass tv to see that pixel sized mouse. lol
[2:45:06] <%mesuking1> my cat once gave me a dead mouse on xmas eve.
[2:45:08] <%Sol_Install> Then Elmo is weak
[2:45:12] <haisho> bigger and stronger than Paige
[2:45:12] <ArrogantPrimate> @Jrocy247 think little sheaths for kitty claws
[2:45:14] <%joylent_blue> "the tv is strong" is very funny to me
[2:45:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> brute screen
[2:45:16] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Elmo wants to be a tv when he grow up
[2:45:19] <ExpressNode> My bone is strong
[2:45:19] <worldbrand> the TV has to put up with whatever paige puts on it. it is resilient
[2:45:21] <laguerrilha> wow that is literally Jesus bath water, feet edition

[2:45:32] <krymzen5> seriously my cat has no hunters intinct
[2:45:35] <TheSlothCast> You require the Gothic Pedicurists Kit
[2:45:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Our cat constantly brings dead mice to our back porch. We cant get her to stop. She insists on feeding us.
[2:45:39] <%KoyaMusa> so the strength hierarchy is paige < pat < elmo < tv?
[2:45:48] <%FrostMass22> @angriestpat Would you drink Jesus' foot bath water?

[2:50:38] <SlimeSlimeSlime> A wild boss fight has appeared!
[2:50:39] <+RayDaug> This game is the Mortal Kombat of Catholicism
[2:50:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Not a fan of Divinity. Being told I have a 80% chance to hit and miss three time in a row is sum bullshit. At least roll dice, don't flip a fuckin coin.
[2:50:42] <+Estuko> SourPls
[2:50:43] <LaughingCatt> makes me think of how hell in Dante's Inferno was described, like a big mining pit

[2:53:29] <katocrimson> didn't know this game has voice acting. Neat
[2:53:30] <Valdorick> You know, stuff like that always confuses me... because like... its something that only the player can be tricked by... Like... Cone head there can clearly see the platform below the screen.
[2:53:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Ah, need some good ol' genuflection in my life.
[2:53:33] <%Sol_Install> every time pat cowards out can we all agree to call him Faithless heathen?
[2:53:35] <Coystick> Sad NPCs that are okay being sad is a very catholic thing

[2:53:48] <haisho> ....that's not how bells works
[2:53:50] <%firehawk_420> The order of the bad backs
[2:53:51] <%nofestu2> its a magic bell
[2:53:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh so thats how bells work?
[2:53:57] <Ominnous> it's a jesus bell

[3:05:15] <%joylent_blue> this attempt is going great
[3:05:17] <%FrostMass22> @42nfl19 The goal is to stop the equivalent of the undead curse in dark souls

[3:05:42] <%arcaderabbit48> @42nfl19 It seems to be to put a stop to The Miracle that's screwing up the world so much, but its unclear on how to do that. We know we need to collect 3 keys to breach a forbidden holy sanctum at least
[3:05:46] <Funkyfjord> not everything has contact damage

[3:09:02] <Ominnous> there's an easier way to do this
[3:09:06] <%joylent_blue> just keep doing it randomly until it works, it's what i'd do

[3:12:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat "Extends the amount of Rosary Beads the Penitent One can equip by bringing the knots to the Jailed Ghost in the Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow. To get there, the Penitent One must traverse through the Mountains of the Endless Dusk past Jondo"

[3:15:42] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat the place you asked why it existed

[3:17:11] <%arcaderabbit48> The force of that bell ringing woul destroy literally everything inside. Do not fuck with sound
[3:17:16] <%FrostMass22> @ze_count This game would kill Woolie
[3:17:16] <buffmurffy> how was control, i played it at an event and thought it was kinda weak
[3:17:17] <Mendin> Pat roomdown left

[3:17:24] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:17:25] <Coystick> Too real for Woolie

[3:17:28] <yourliteraldog> Woolie isn't catholic tho
[3:17:29] <heroneiden> i think blasphemous is the best metroidvania ive played so far
[3:17:30] <%mh9s> too jesus for woolz

[3:17:33] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wooly's Catholic, or Christian?
[3:17:33] <Mister_McDerp> he'd probably hate the religious stuff
[3:17:38] <Parapattern> Woolie sweating
[3:17:39] <%Dioliciouss> I mainly stuck around to watch Blasphemous while I play Astral Chain
[3:17:42] <Aydarkzero> this might give Woolie flashbacks
[3:17:44] <Coystick> Woolie's Mom of the Burned Visage
[3:17:48] <%hntronium> Woolie M and his Other M
[3:17:51] <IminyourBase> there is an overlap

[3:18:05] <%PatIsMyHero> the lord hates woolie
[3:18:08] <yourliteraldog> Yes It's a heretical religion
[3:18:10] <%mh9s> one of them heretic sects
[3:18:15] <+gralho> the game gives me Spanish Inquisition vibes more than anything else
[3:18:17] <Pyrrhus90> woolie the heretic
[3:18:18] <%joylent_blue> Trash_leviathan that's latter day saints or some shit

[3:18:26] <%rdark_ksu> Yea when he mentioned the no pork thing I was like wtf we catholics love pork
[3:18:27] <+Ryuutennou> @Trash_leviathan that's the Latter-Day Saints, not Seventh-Day Adventists

[3:18:59] <Mendin> Whats that smell
[3:19:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YO! Damn
[3:19:01] <%ElenaManetta> Does anyone remember that Super Best Friends LP that was a point and click game with some hand-drawn art, some medieval evil fantasy stuff. I think at one point, you run into talking rats who seem hospitable but want to eat tyou?
[3:19:02] <%Ghost__Pantsu> I thought this was a christian stream FeelsBadMan
[3:19:08] <krymzen5> you also missed a room in the bottom right @AngriestPat
[3:19:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> IT'S BLUD
[3:19:15] <+gerahwar> BLUUUD
[3:19:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger SWEET, SWEET BLUUD
[3:19:19] <+gralho> this game is the Spanish Inquisition in a nutshell
[3:19:21] <%luckysteak> the silence is deafening
[3:19:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> what bosses has he fought
[3:19:27] <%rdark_ksu> @ElenaManetta Tormentum
[3:19:28] <%hntronium> and it doesn't respawn any enemies too
[3:19:31] <krymzen5> no the ladder there
[3:19:31] <Mendin> Ten Pie and Our Lady
[3:19:32] <%ElenaManetta> tHAT'S IT!
[3:19:39] <%floralkami> @elenamanetta yaaaaaaah, the one about metal purgatory
[3:19:41] <%FirearmsInstructor> This fucking guy is behind held together by his BALLS
[3:19:45] <%rdark_ksu> I liked that LP too
[3:19:48] <%walternatorz> why does that guy walk like his balls are stuck to his legs?
[3:19:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor What a good game, what a great animation.
[3:19:57] <%Laecerelius> I don't remember the rat but I do remember the super metal train
[3:20:00] <%firehawk_420> @elenamanetta either I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream or Tormentum is probs what you’re thinking of
[3:20:08] <yourliteraldog> Strong gooch
[3:20:11] <Trash_leviathan> was that the hunters mark ?
[3:20:12] <sniffy77> so whats the basic plot of this game?
[3:20:20] <+HweeWikk> Jesus
[3:20:21] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, new duds?
[3:20:27] <ThatGuyThere03> I strongly reccomend people play the SotN OST over this
[3:20:29] <bear_breaker20> idk why people say woolie wouldnt like this, he loves this shit
[3:20:30] <Mendin> I saw a baby
[3:20:31] <laguerrilha> Jesus
[3:20:32] <puse9> you missed a baby
[3:20:32] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Shits Fuck'd Yo
[3:20:33] <haisho> you are the BIG GUILTY
[3:20:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @walternatorz He's cut from the top of his head to his dick
[3:20:34] <sniffy77> hat guy does a jesus?
[3:20:37] <%FrostMass22> G U I L T
[3:20:37] <+Pyroclase> What is the Miracle?
[3:20:40] <+nekodelic> @deaconbluesclues 7th day adventists are another level. my country is mostly Catholic and it's considered the more progressive popular form of Christianity we have here because the second most popular are adventists
[3:20:41] <%floralkami> @walternatorz consider it one of the great miracles
[3:20:42] <%jiin6> church bad, your bad
[3:20:45] <+gralho> REPENT!!
[3:20:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> @walternatorz more like *SPLIT*
[3:20:50] <haisho> go do some BIG PENANCE
[3:20:50] <LaughingCatt> Sin is manifest & everyone needs a whippin
[3:20:52] <%averyoddjew> why is your helmet gold?
[3:20:55] <%PatIsMyHero> shits bad
[3:20:57] <%dukenux> wtf is that
[3:20:59] <ThatGuyThere03> Da jesus made people really sad
[3:21:00] <puse9> the miracle is explained in the game's items and such
[3:21:00] <Mendin> The Miracle has made manifest every form of guilt, punishment, repentence, etc
[3:21:04] <%hntronium> shortcuts!
[3:21:05] <+gerahwar> Gotta repent so hard!
[3:21:06] <%Laecerelius> Catholic guilt fucked up the world because some lady smashed a jesus into her chest until it turned into a sword and killed her
[3:21:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @averyoddjew because he bought the delux edition
[3:21:12] <spacecatstreams> does penitent mean be a savage demon slayer?
[3:21:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Any idea if the team / developers who made this game made anything prior to this?
[3:21:25] <%luftraumm1> keep going left and up
[3:21:29] <Coystick> There's a thing in Catholicism that the rib that God took from Adam & turned into Eve was actually his penis bone which is why we have that seam in our ballsack and no penis bone, but the same number of ribs on either side.
[3:21:29] <LaughingCatt> no, it means being a savage demon slayer & feeling bad about it
[3:21:33] <+Pyroclase> hahahhah

[3:22:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> I feel like Protestantism is automatically scarier than Catholicism because Protestants actually read their Bible's and, well, the book is scary.

[3:24:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @spacecatstreams That's always rough. I knew a gal who's family were Christian Scientists. They believed that prayer would help her asthma. It was pretty bad.
[3:24:02] <%firehawk_420> Learning that Easter and Christmas are religious things totally ruined those holidays for me
[3:24:02] <%Calek> @AngriestPat instead of going back down you might like going all the way left

[3:34:21] <%TheBitingIrish> Is that dude missing an arm, a leg, and covered in bandages?
[3:34:22] <%StaceMcGate> So why people trying to kill the Penitent One? Is it cause the suffering is just so nice they don't want to lose it?
[3:34:26] <Mendin> The opening cutscene of this game is a nun beating herself in the chest with the bottom of a jesus statue saying "I HAVE SO MUCH GUILT PLEASE END ME MIRACLE-KUN" and then it turns into a sword
[3:34:26] <%Jrocy247> Man, I swear...Your Character would look so cooler if it weren't for the stupid Pointy Helmet...
[3:34:32] <cosmicgoatee> Based tears
[3:34:41] <%firehawk_420> The pointy helmet is great
[3:34:42] <+SamleyTimes> the pointy helmet is cool cmon
[3:34:47] <%Calek> got to do it from higher up
[3:34:51] <%Jrocy247> No.....No it's really not
[3:34:51] <Mendin> The explosion comes from a slightly higher fall distance
[3:34:53] <+gerahwar> Yay your sword farts
[3:34:56] <%king_wragles> @Jrocy247 just let it grow on you. It grows on you
[3:34:57] <+Estuko> the pointy helmet is COOL
[3:34:57] <+SamleyTimes> it really is
[3:34:58] <$masneo2> @AngriestPat are you going to get Indivisible when it comes out?
[3:35:00] <%averyoddjew> agreed
[3:35:01] <LixFury> Its Stupid on purpose!

[3:35:09] <%firehawk_420> Yes.... yes it really is
[3:35:10] <%WhereIsWill> it def grows on yta
[3:35:10] <yourliteraldog> dunce cap
[3:35:14] <haisho> I'm just wondering why a headbutt isn't a move in this game
[3:35:14] <krlos970> @stacemcgate I think cause he wants yo stop the miracle
[3:35:14] <%Big_King_Coconut> pointy hat guy for Smash
[3:35:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's dumb, but cool. like video games.
[3:35:16] <%StaceMcGate> Pointy Helmet is a bucket of blood, can't get more metal than that
[3:35:18] <%averyoddjew> i was on board with the helmet after he filled it with blood
[3:35:19] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Pointy Helmets are an acquired taste.
[3:35:22] <Coystick> Compliments his sword in his silhouette
[3:35:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a stupid pointy helmet filled with blood! How is it not cool
[3:35:26] <yourliteraldog> but metal
[3:35:27] <+Mitchellsocks> You're basically Gundyr
[3:35:30] <%floralkami> it is, i like the thematic
[3:35:30] <Pyrrhus90> it's cool, and if you salk the spanish inquisition will pay you a visit
[3:35:35] <%Jrocy247> I just....I just hate it's pointiness
[3:35:40] <+SamleyTimes> see
[3:35:41] <%Laecerelius> well at least you have the guilt guy to help out if you can't get your souls back
[3:35:43] <spiegspikel> Just headbutt people. Why do you even need a sword?
[3:35:43] <Coystick> Mirroe Knight Gundyr
[3:35:44] <wheke_> the hat helps make his design more unique and stand out more
[3:35:48] <%WhereIsWill> games like UR NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE YET
[3:35:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I hate that. I feel anxious that I have realy progress to make
[3:35:59] <%ElenaManetta> In a world of spikes, I get nervous when I go the wrong way because I know I have to backtrack
[3:36:00] <+TaterBurglar> You're just describing life at this point
[3:36:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> real*
[3:36:01] <%StaceMcGate> This game has as many insta-kill spikes as Mighty No 9
[3:36:02] <cosmicgoatee> There's a symbolism in being a devout conehead and I love it
[3:36:04] <Mendin> Is it too heavy? Unfashionable? Uncomfortable? GOOD THAT MEANS YOU ARE SUFFERING FOR YOUR SINS
[3:36:21] <+SamleyTimes> no do it wronger
[3:36:28] <wheke_> You. Did it.
[3:36:39] <%Laecerelius> WHOOO!
[3:36:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> Good job.
[3:36:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> We need a Yoshi to walk on all these spikes

[3:37:54] <%Jrocy247> That's a lot of dead bodies
[3:37:54] <alexandrecau> is he a pacifist onion knight?
[3:37:57] <haisho> big Dark Souls shortcuts
[3:38:00] <cosmicgoatee> Shortcuts are so good Kreygasm
[3:38:00] <%Big_King_Coconut> that's the second-biggest pile of dead guys I ever saw
[3:38:03] <+Bouerd> That's some DS1 shit right there
[3:38:05] <%TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat DO you have to reequip the blue bead now?
[3:38:06] <fazoburquina> shortcut porn
[3:38:06] <+CaptainGrime> HUGE SHORTCUT
[3:38:07] <%ElenaManetta> the start of the GAME?
[3:38:09] <haisho> now beat up the Black Knights that showed up in the Undead Asylum
[3:38:15] <%StaceMcGate> But why naked tho?
[3:38:19] <Ominnous> probably something at the spawn
[3:38:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @StaceMcGate ...because shut up
[3:38:33] <+Pyroclase> are those other helmets
[3:38:36] <+gerahwar> So much juuuuuice
[3:38:39] <%Jrocy247> @StaceMcGate Because Catholicism
[3:38:43] <Trash_leviathan> juice it up
[3:38:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate GUILT
[3:38:49] <cosmicgoatee> Pats DS senses are off the charts
[3:38:50] <%firehawk_420> @stacemcgate their clothes rotted away. The comic for the game explains that.
[3:39:00] <+Pyroclase> is that a massive ruined cathedral full of ead bodies? I need to play this game
[3:39:01] <Mendin> All the other ones died long enough ago that their clothes rotted off, yeah
[3:39:04] <%StaceMcGate> When Catholics die they strip you and throw you on the naked man pile?
[3:39:07] <+gerahwar> Hey Jeebus!
[3:39:09] <%ElenaManetta> The background scale in this game freaks me out
[3:39:10] <yourliteraldog> evangelion?
[3:39:10] <%Jrocy247> WAIT the fucking comic explains why they don't have cloths? LUL
[3:39:12] <+Pyroclase> that's amazing holy shit
[3:39:20] <%Laecerelius> I guess they could get back up like you can but they're too big of bitches to do it
[3:39:20] <Pyrrhus90> catholicism have some cool looking shit really, especially in cathedrals
[3:39:21] <+nekodelic> give blood
[3:39:21] <%FirearmsInstructor> Jezus christ is huge
[3:39:21] <sakeydo> what no crows?
[3:39:21] <%ElenaManetta> Because like, the screen is so big and you STILL can't see all of it
[3:39:23] <%firehawk_420> The comic is on Pats twitter by the by
[3:39:24] <cosmicgoatee> Watch it be like hollow knight where it's a whole other area
[3:39:25] <%ElenaManetta> And that's in the back
[3:39:26] <puse9> it explains why he had a sword
[3:39:33] <Ominnous> there was a dope orgy here
[3:39:33] <+SamleyTimes> yeah the comic explains how you got here too
[3:39:33] <ovan20> Jesus, will Pat go to heaven?
[3:39:33] <Pyrrhus90> gotta apreciate the aesthetic
[3:39:36] <%TheBitingIrish> So do the spikes preserve the bodies or something?
[3:39:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate It is because of the first sin that we must wear clothes, or some shit like that.
[3:39:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> everyone is big except you
[3:39:45] <ivansonic08> is jesus wearing slippers?
[3:39:47] <+RiceeFTW> @TheBitingIrish those are their hats
[3:39:52] <%TheBitingIrish> o
[3:39:55] <+SamleyTimes> @TheBitingIrish probably the MIRACLE doesnt let them rot?
[3:39:58] <Trash_leviathan> bell time
[3:39:59] <+JustToWatch> that's weird, I only got a medium blue wax bead there
[3:40:02] <Mendin> Yeah Silent Penitent One got his magic sword, got his ass kicked by Blind Penitent One Vergil, and they threw your corpse onto the pile
[3:40:13] <%Jrocy247> MAN I hope to GOD you're able to Fight Jesus as a Super Boss
[3:40:17] <Mendin> @JustToWatch It sizes up your bead, so a medium would become large, and a small would become medium
[3:40:24] <%Laecerelius> did you pick up the blue wax in front of the ghost lady?
[3:40:24] <copyritetm> that chime is the most dark souls thing ever
[3:40:26] <%TheBitingIrish> @JustToWatch Each candle makes the respective bead bigger
[3:40:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> gimme some blue dye, and I'll give you some WAX
[3:40:26] <cosmicgoatee> Bellight town beckons
[3:40:37] <+Pyroclase> So is this like Dark Souls where people just can't die?
[3:40:43] <%Big_King_Coconut> Stanley Splitman
[3:40:48] <+JustToWatch> oh
[3:40:54] <+RiceeFTW> no people super die in this
[3:41:03] <Mendin> Dying would be an end to the PUNISHMENT FOR YOUR SINS but yeah people die
[3:41:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> dude..... lol
[3:41:09] <%floralkami> @ovan20 *this jesus* "inconceivable screaming that causes your eyes to gain teeth
[3:41:12] <%firehawk_420> Penitent Ones, at the least, don’t seem to die.
[3:41:17] <%Jrocy247> @Pyroclase That's normal even in Dark Souls. Everyone is literally a Ash Zombie in Dark Souls
[3:41:18] <Pyrrhus90> perhaps jesus was the first penitent one
[3:41:20] <%arcaderabbit48> @Pyroclase Some people die, but others are stuck as horrible warped monsters for some reason. May or may not have to do with your Guilt
[3:41:28] <+SamleyTimes> just you cant die. I dont know if they talk about respawning in the lore tho
[3:41:28] <+Pyroclase> ahhh, I got it now
[3:41:29] <+RiceeFTW> all the bodies from the first room are penitent ones tho
[3:41:31] <Mendin> The first penitent one turned into a giant tree and burnt down
[3:41:34] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat yep, they're being held together by the balls.
[3:41:37] <+Pyroclase> the miracle turns people into monsters that represent their sin
[3:41:41] <Trash_leviathan> i wonder if the final boss is jesus
[3:41:44] <%Calek> to the left to the left~
[3:41:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> slide to left
[3:41:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> criss cross
[3:41:51] <ovan20> @floralkami Jesus went through some life changes since i hard of him D:

[3:45:37] <%firehawk_420> I think skelly person is also a lady, she mentions the painting on her back being her original likeness before getting skeletonized
[3:45:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> "Do the death Pat"
[3:45:40] <%Jrocy247> THAT WILL NEVER STOP BEING FUNNY

[3:46:04] <%StaceMcGate> Remember how many times Pat died in the mountains? good times
[3:46:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat let out a squeak last stream during ice platforming
[3:46:25] <%floralkami> that is extra brutal for no reason
[3:46:33] <%ElenaManetta> How come everyone in the religious world is always muscular? All the bodies and statues you see are like, super ripped people. There's no one with a beer gut.
[3:46:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it was manly
[3:46:35] <%Bt_Robot> Why aren't you going down on the right side of that big room?
[3:46:46] <NotSoAccurateNo1> insta-death platforming mistakes are never fun. The entry into Sigma's fortress always fucked me up bad

[4:12:16] <pabloelenano2> wrong side
[4:12:28] <%floralkami> @jiin6 why not? they should be pure life energy

[4:33:56] <+RiceeFTW> you did it
[4:33:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Needs more quoting from the books of Saints, but it's pretty close
[4:33:57] <+JacktheMan18> Can't you just jump off the left side?

[4:34:14] <Louie_Salmon> That's a great clip, because if you zoom in it REALLY just seems like he told fuggins to fuck off
[4:34:16] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The most "Catholic" thing I've seen here is the word "Holy" lol it's barely actually anything remotely near Catholicism that I'm aware of.
[4:34:22] <+JacktheMan18> Back where the elevator was i mean
[4:34:25] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat cam't you drop down from the left in the elevator?

[4:34:57] <krlos970> You need a relic for that
[4:35:00] <%walternatorz> did you just walk off.
[4:35:04] <+DeaconBluesClues> @angriestpat you ever play actraiser
[4:35:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> Now you can check underneith
[4:35:05] <+jetjagger222> its creepy spanish-flavored catholicism; i.e. the whole saints and inquisition thing
[4:35:05] <+Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger lmfao, jesus I still remember that fucking song. "and she only 14."
[4:35:06] <astrophizz> what is this, castlevania with fall deaths like that lol

[4:35:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko That show was great lol
[4:35:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger fuckoff and go do cocaine
[4:35:53] <%Laecerelius> time for extreme fart exploration
[4:35:57] <%Calek> @AngriestPat go to the tree where you fought angel lady first
[4:36:01] <%WhereIsWill> traverse the fartlands
[4:36:03] <Mendin> You really are going to want to do the tree first
[4:36:04] <+nekodelic> @firearmsinstructor it's pretty accurate to the era tbh. Spanish inquisition was all about exploiting people's sense of guilt for money
[4:36:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Maybe I will, huh? Did you ever think of that?
[4:36:15] <%Calek> okie dokie
[4:36:21] <%Laecerelius> the fart mines are right here, though!
[4:36:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can wag my finger at you
[4:36:25] <%KikiBunni> @AngriestPat but pat, don't you want a new relic?
[4:36:27] <%Starlight_Gamer> go for it pat
[4:36:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but that's about it
[4:36:31] <@Fuggins4U> the juice is loose
[4:36:33] <%dukenux> also, the conical hats were put on interrogated heretics
[4:36:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> JOOS
[4:36:46] <%dukenux> thats were those come from
[4:36:47] <+Ell1ot> is it still a fart if it's juice?
[4:36:49] <+Zereaux> WE ARE THE FART JUICE CHAT
[4:37:03] <%Laecerelius> MINE UP THAT FART JUICE, PAT!
[4:37:04] <%ScreamLord> Fart Ore
[4:37:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> boiling fart juice
[4:37:10] <ovan20> yup, "fart-juice" is the worst word i heard the entire week 0_o
[4:37:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @nekodelic Ok I'll absolutely concede that point. I was talking more aesthetically / directly. IE symbols and whatnot.
[4:37:11] <%Andrizzleton> It’s for traversal...you should go to the tree first
[4:37:12] <%Jrocy247> "Terribler"
[4:37:13] <@Fuggins4U> yep
[4:37:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> LOOS JOOS
[4:37:17] <%dukenux> if its a juice, its a shart in this point
[4:37:22] <+moshpitmoira> "terribliest"
[4:37:26] <deviljhojho94> Shoulda gone to a hispanic church
[4:37:29] <%Laecerelius> They really need to trump up how fucking metal all that shit is
[4:37:30] <%mh9s> wish there was more fart juice in our church
[4:37:33] <%Maids4lyfe> pat why
[4:37:33] <%Jrocy247> "Terribling"
[4:37:40] <+KingStrongStyle> this resident evil looks weird
[4:37:41] <%dukenux> Shouldve visited a Bone Chapel
[4:37:43] <%StaceMcGate> Betcha Woolie's getting into this after the next podcast
[4:37:43] <pabloelenano2> @deviljhojho94 no they suck
[4:37:47] <+SamleyTimes> buckets O' upgrades
[4:37:49] <+Estuko> hm, my stuff was a little metal. one of my favorites was about the sun as a goddess I told you guys about it. regarding the solar eclipse
[4:37:50] <StarsCrusader> Do you have the relic that lets you jump in water already?
[4:37:51] <Coystick> You are very strong and extremely pointy.
[4:37:51] <@Fuggins4U> also church said abstinence, fuck that
[4:37:51] <bear_breaker20> I wish there were more live sacrifices in church*
[4:37:54] <%StripesUltimateEdition> they just need to bring up Samson and his donkey jawbone more
[4:37:54] <Pyrrhus90> here in south america church doesn't look like this either :c
[4:38:00] <deviljhojho94> @pabloelenano2 of course, but he was asking for metal shit
[4:38:02] <Pyrrhus90> perhaps in spain?
[4:38:03] <+jetjagger222> those ladies are wearing the heads of the sarcophagi shields
[4:38:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Legion should have got more play in church
[4:38:05] <xeros720> the only way to deal with your guilt is to become huge
[4:38:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @nekodelic like "Rosary" and maybe scriptures, but not actual hymns or psalms or scripture or anything.
[4:38:07] <Pyrrhus90> LUL
[4:38:08] <deviljhojho94> @pabloelenano2 its all blood and sacrifice there

[4:38:21] <%Starlight_Gamer> do it again
[4:38:24] <+Pyroclase> what's with the weird slime people?
[4:38:29] <%Jrocy247> Abstinence is fucking stupid. You are such a poor soul if you follow that....
[4:38:29] <Funkyfjord> the big flip attack is just the forth attack in the string
[4:38:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean, I'll take your word for it
[4:38:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> nah, it's the 4th combo strike
[4:38:35] <deviljhojho94> @pabloelenano2 maybe yours sucked buddy tomatoCool

[4:39:56] <+Harkness_the_Cleric> @Crushter bottom left of your screen
[4:39:57] <+moshpitmoira> This game's soundtrack sounds very "flight or fight response activate-y"

[4:40:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Stop moving for a second so people can type and respond and give you a point of reference. :)
[4:40:43] <Crushter> Pat can't get any item that's connected to water until after the Mother of Mothers
[4:40:44] <%firehawk_420> At the bottom of that pit with the ladder going down to it. Where the fart juice knocked you down @angriestpat

[4:41:34] <%NeroInfinite> You literally can't avoid miasma

[4:42:07] <Crushter> You'll help him two more times, and you'll be good, you can't miss him either
[4:42:08] <Funkyfjord> he kinda goes on a straight path
[4:42:15] <%NeroInfinite> More games should put their musicon spotify tbh
[4:42:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Those pipes are like my nose when my allergies go bad. Non-stop drippage of green goo.
[4:42:25] <%NeroInfinite> I'm looking at you nintendo
[4:42:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[4:42:29] <Crushter> You can't get that item either yet in that room
[4:42:30] <%FirearmsInstructor> xDDDD
[4:42:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> and occaisionally killing small men below me
[4:42:43] <Crushter> lol
[4:42:49] <+Estuko> That guitar give me left 4 dead vibes kinda
[4:42:53] <%ScreamLord> Fuck
[4:42:58] <Crushter> Only thing I have left to do is do the Bronze Trophy run
[4:42:58] <Jolnir> this music is fucking nice
[4:43:11] <tragicharmony46> we need shitstorm :,(
[4:43:12] <+Estuko> Jesus that's brutal
[4:43:13] <%ScreamLord> Brutal
[4:43:15] <+Harkness_the_Cleric> D: MURDER
[4:43:15] <Pyrrhus90> i love that one
[4:43:16] <%TheBitingIrish> EGG
[4:43:18] <%cTAKU> wow
[4:43:25] <Crushter> oh @AngriestPat did you enjoy the Hollow Knight platform segment haha
[4:43:34] <Jolnir> holy fuck look at this shit
[4:43:50] <Crushter> also if you want a hint for the egg, return to where you fought the Angel
[4:44:01] <+nekodelic> @firearmsinstructor it reminds me of Gustave Doré's art, and he used to do a lot of religious lithography. my copy of The Divine Comedy has some of them. other than that, I agree with you, but we also have to concede that the Church itself has historically been pretty corrupt, especially back in the day. I really like the new pope tho
[4:44:06] <%Jrocy247> Hollow Knight is a lot more forgiving with it's platforming though
[4:44:13] <deviljhojho94> angels and eggs
[4:44:14] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you give the bouquet to the healing guys/;
[4:44:17] <+arfsm95> ?
[4:44:21] <Crushter> yeah, there's a harder platformer segment later
[4:44:28] <+SamleyTimes> new pope licks feet
[4:44:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Jrocy247 didn't stop Pat from dying more to platforming than bosses
[4:44:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> is that the BONE ZONE
[4:44:53] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Neat fact about the ossuary there: The bone cages mostly correspond to the world map, so if you're missing a bone, you know the vague idea to look in
[4:44:55] <tragicharmony46> S H I T S T O R M
[4:44:58] <Crushter> holy wrath makes the attack actually useful against certain enemies that you can time
[4:45:01] <%Jrocy247> @Sphincter_Spelunker Wow, did he really? LUL
[4:45:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The new Pope ain't Emily, so it ain't my pope.
[4:45:12] <+jetjagger222> charge upgrade makes the charge time reasonable
[4:45:26] <%firehawk_420> I hope all those backer bones form into a giant skeleton boss
[4:45:27] <Crushter> yeah but the attack is still not as sick as when gets a stacking projectile component
[4:45:30] <%Laecerelius> I've noticed that when you enter an area you like lose two tears and then immediately regain them. kinda odd
[4:45:31] <%dukenux> also: another point of reference you.might want to look up: Francisco de Goya art: especially "The Black Paintings" or his work from the Franco-Spanish war period.
[4:45:35] <Morbidmort> look at all those pointy hatted corpses
[4:45:46] <%dukenux> *you want to look up
[4:45:51] <Crushter> I hope everyone liked their Vergil comic
[4:46:05] <Crushter> the defense bonuses stack
[4:46:08] <Crushter> so feel free
[4:46:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 wtf pat, you're still up!? Oh whatever, i bet you were talking shit about me again while i wasn't here. Anyway, I wish to hire Paige's voice talent for a thing I'm planning. Pass the message on, and I'll be on the discord.
[4:46:15] <dan_g_v> how many spanish damons has pat killed today?
[4:46:19] <%Laecerelius> and now it's not doing it anymore
[4:46:27] <+nekodelic> health is indeed vital
[4:46:30] <deviljhojho94> he actually wasnt this time!
[4:46:31] <Crushter> man the delux skin is really nice
[4:46:36] <+jetjagger222> another art reference is "in ictu oculi"
[4:46:42] <Crushter> but I like the Lord o Bones skin
[4:46:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @nekodelic From what you just said I'm guessing you're much more knowledgeable, and cultured about these things. My observation was based on my limited exposure during my upbringing. My family was far from devout, but from my modern-day experience I don't see anything more than the loosest of similarities.
[4:47:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> His character looks like a shitty eva. That is to say a normal eva.
[4:47:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> nice
[4:47:26] <Crushter> maybe I'll do bronze trophy while you're playing
[4:47:27] <+jetjagger222> more like one of starscream's conehead buddies
[4:47:31] <Crushter> takin a break tho
[4:47:36] <+jetjagger222> especially with that color scheme
[4:47:38] <cosmicgoatee> I love collectathons in these kinds of games, painful to get all of them but worth it
[4:47:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Starscream is a shitty Eva
[4:47:44] <+Jayjayouch> Why is his character that color
[4:47:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> S C A R E
[4:47:57] <Crushter> I one and doned the final bosses, felt really nice after all the prep
[4:47:59] <%floralkami> @jayjayouch deluxe edition
[4:47:59] <CALLthaDoctah> that purple and gold is big pimpin
[4:48:01] <Crushter> @Jayjayouch its a skin
[4:48:02] <%dukenux> also, basicly lots of baroque art, all the 'memento mori' stuff
[4:48:03] <teacup_berserker> Hey chat and Pat o/
[4:48:05] <+Pyroclase> @Jayjayouch Deluxe edition skin
[4:48:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> now leave the screen and come back
[4:48:11] <+Jayjayouch> ooo alright thanks

[4:48:14] <%TheBitingIrish> NOTHIIING! ♫
[4:48:15] <StarsCrusader> Now leave and come back
[4:48:18] <%Laecerelius> okay?
[4:48:19] <%Calek> re enter the screen
[4:48:21] <+jetjagger222> screen switch
[4:48:25] <deviljhojho94> He looks like one of the guys from A procession of flaggelants, you know the painting? But the cone is metal
[4:48:28] <pabloelenano2> leave and go back
[4:48:30] <ovan20> maybe, come back later?
[4:48:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I have no idea what I'm looking at...
[4:48:40] <Crushter> enjoy your awful egg
[4:48:41] <+jetjagger222> bunch of dead burning motherfuckers
[4:48:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> monkaS
[4:48:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @nekodelic Haven't practiced in a few decades so I'm not up to speed. Glad to hear there's a decent pope, from your perspective, at least. :)
[4:48:46] <%TheBitingIrish> Oof, that pallate error
[4:48:48] <teacup_berserker> oh ew what

[4:49:26] <TheDr0t> @Crushter yep
[4:49:30] <deviljhojho94> yeah those processions are pretty cool. They freak out americans because of the pointy hats tho
[4:49:31] <xeros720> that three faced lady is gonna be so pissed when she finds out we lost her hair baby
[4:49:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> NO U
[4:49:33] <deviljhojho94> Well, some of them

[4:50:04] <+jetjagger222> flagellation is still practiced in the philippines
[4:50:06] <deviljhojho94> Paige is on a farm far away
[4:50:08] <Crushter> @TheDr0t the pope said "give us judgment" to the unknowable will of god, and it said okay, but in overdrive this time since the pope asked directly
[4:50:09] <+nekodelic> @firearmsinstructor even though I consider myself an atheist currently, the history and culture is fascinating to me
[4:50:19] <%HyraFukit> Is Pat excited for the Code:Vein game or no? Ive not been around much lately x.x
[4:50:26] <Crushter> You're doomguy, here to fix that shit, cause someone's gotta do it

[4:52:33] <%TheBitingIrish> ?
[4:52:33] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd <3
[4:52:39] <%s_xylocalsingles> s_xylocalsingles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! hello famther, when are you going to do a disastrous human fall flat stream with paige, fuggins, or skelmo. strident smel ssaryn binch

[4:52:48] <%Bane_Kaikyo> He said it was blessed? Still sounds fucked up to me
[4:52:50] <Crushter> @AngriestPat the Miracle fused the three of them together in an egg of hair after each suffered some kind of ruin with their beloved
[4:52:57] <+nekodelic> read the item, not the lore
[4:53:10] <%FirearmsInstructor> RUDE
[4:53:12] <TheDr0t> half man hafl undead... all hero
[4:53:21] <Crushter> One's fortunes were ruined, another abandoned on the altar and one their love died
[4:53:24] <suikudo> That was a little extra dont you think?
[4:53:25] <%MoraMiarty> these guys seem bizarrely low res now that youve been elsewhere
[4:53:30] <%floralkami> @bane_kaikyo it's the theme of the game
[4:53:33] <+Estuko> LMFAO
[4:53:36] <+jetjagger222> yeah the knife guys dont look great
[4:53:46] <deviljhojho94> get absolutely fucked
[4:53:53] <+Estuko> the crunch made me laugh because I thought of how it sounded like a rice crispie treat and my drink came out of my nose
[4:53:55] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you need the church item with the pilgrim
[4:53:58] <Mendin> Need that rusted iron ring
[4:54:01] <Crushter> anything to do with water does
[4:54:01] <%TheBitingIrish> Attack bounce maybe
[4:54:01] <%Laecerelius> need water/goop jump for that, probably
[4:54:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love me a good rice krispie treat
[4:54:19] <deviljhojho94> rice krispies are underrated
[4:54:20] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Estuko D: Of the guy's head being crushed? D:
[4:54:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @floralkami That's cool...... but also pretty fucked up and gross.... but I guess that's the point

[4:54:25] <+Estuko> @FirearmsInstructor yeah lmfao
[4:54:29] <%Laecerelius> and the bell area had grappling points too

[4:54:38] <Crushter> don't be like me, beating my head against the wall on my first playthrough looking for a double jump lol
[4:54:52] <Mendin> I don't know when you plan on stopping but I do hope you at least poke your nose into Sen's Fortress before ending tonight
[4:54:53] <%Thelastofthemohicans> Yo those wheel parrys look satisfying
[4:54:54] <ZE_Count> So what dos the three tongues do?
[4:54:58] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you can also get the arguably best spell in the game now
[4:55:01] <%TheBitingIrish> Rice Krispie Treat cereal is muh favorite
[4:55:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Estuko .... damn now I want rice crispies treats :(

[4:57:08] <deviljhojho94> Fetus truly are the most craven creatures on this land
[4:57:12] <Ultimatefool> I can't tell if this game is good or not
[4:57:17] <chambatron> Wouldn't be surprised
[4:57:23] <Morbidmort> Fetus of God, Son of the Miracle, what's the difference?
[4:57:25] <+SamleyTimes> ITS GOOD AF
[4:57:26] <+Mitchellsocks> Did he already beat Our Lady?
[4:57:33] <StarsCrusader> It's good, but a bit janky
[4:57:36] <+jetjagger222> holified
[4:57:37] <beetbo2> @deviljhojho94 don’t fetuses rip people in half?
[4:57:39] <Crushter> @AngriestPat did you get Tentudia's guts underneath the entrance to Piedad's chruch?
[4:57:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This game reminds me of Infant Annhilitor. Good band.
[4:57:43] <Pyrrhus90> so far seems great
[4:57:56] <deviljhojho94> @beetbo2 yeah, always make sure to carry some fetus repelent with you
[4:57:58] <+Pyroclase> that fucking bloodborne elevator
[4:58:07] <%KoyaMusa> you gave the hair
[4:58:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Eeeww
[4:58:13] <+Mitchellsocks> I forgot how much you can do everything in whatever order in this game
[4:58:15] <TheDr0t> bruh
[4:58:15] <chambatron> It reminds me of an early release of Dead Cells without the rouge-like elements
[4:58:18] <%rdark_ksu> here I have brought you some viscera
[4:58:20] <Crushter> @AngriestPat good, you can go get her bones now, and get straight up one of the best spells
[4:58:21] <deviljhojho94> he was into it
[4:58:26] <+jetjagger222> nobody expects viscera
[4:58:35] <beetbo2> @deviljhojho94 A spoon of Jesus a day keeps the Baby away
[4:58:50] <Crushter> he's gonna over think this
[4:58:55] <Kristoffers> welp
[4:58:56] <Pyrrhus90> other side pat
[4:58:57] <Crushter> just jump up on the other side
[4:58:58] <LodiFrostbeard> the other side genius
[4:58:58] <Mendin> The proximity detection of these are a bit wonky
[4:58:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat De-equip item and slash?
[4:58:59] <pabloelenano2> wrong side and be patient
[4:59:00] <+arfsm95> other side idiot
[4:59:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> jump from the other side
[4:59:03] <xeros720> i guess it's impossible then
[4:59:04] <suikudo> Bruh
[4:59:07] <%dukenux> think i preffer classic metroidvania maps to roguelike procedurals
[4:59:10] <%mishtershmee> mishtershmee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! How's the Soulsvania, Pat?
[4:59:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Dig up, stoopid

[4:59:23] <deviljhojho94> monkaS
[4:59:25] <chambatron> No it's not pat c'mon

[4:59:49] <%dukenux> furry guilt
[4:59:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> delicious fruit of miracle
[4:59:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> apatWink
[5:00:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate It likes dogs I guess.
[5:00:06] <%dukenux> apatGib
[5:00:07] <%Laecerelius> more damage?
[5:00:11] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate damage
[5:00:14] <Crushter> woops
[5:00:14] <deviljhojho94> its possible
[5:00:15] <%StaceMcGate> Str go up
[5:00:20] <Morbidmort> Numbers go up
[5:00:22] <Crushter> it is
[5:00:22] <StarsCrusader> DMG up
[5:00:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> punch power go up
[5:00:25] <xeros720> yeyeyeye, damage up
[5:00:37] <Mendin> That map is bugged
[5:00:39] <Sapphire_Breeze> that's a lie
[5:00:40] <+SamleyTimes> Its just how that room is
[5:00:42] <+DeaconBluesClues> you take those gold coins boy those catdoggedadies don't need cash
[5:00:42] <Crushter> @AngriestPat there's not, you don't need 100 percent map anyway
[5:00:47] <Mendin> There's areas later that never show up for some odd reason
[5:00:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why is EVERY item you've gotten since I started watching all just gross shit?
[5:00:52] <+jetjagger222> mayyybe future DLC?
[5:01:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> gross shit is the strongest
[5:01:08] <+cvp5127> youre bugged pat
[5:01:09] <Louie_Salmon> @bane_kaikyo All of the items are gross shit
[5:01:10] <+Zereaux> YOU MEAN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[5:01:10] <Crushter> @Bane_Kaikyo well when you worship the literal body and blood of the son of god...
[5:01:15] <%TheBitingIrish> @Bane_Kaikyo Welcome to religion
[5:01:18] <Morbidmort> @Bane_Kaikyo you expect a game with this style isn't going to just have gross things?
[5:01:18] <+jetjagger222> relics
[5:01:25] <%dukenux> cause relics
[5:01:27] <%Nina96> have the devs talked about fixing the save bug yet @AngriestPat
[5:01:34] <+DeaconBluesClues> @bane_kaikyo game probably design. by atheists who got super salt over getting checkmated
[5:01:44] <%NeroInfinite> Catholic relics are kinda gross
[5:01:48] <+jetjagger222> they used to have a whole industry dedicated to chopping purported saints' bodies up and distributing them to churches
[5:01:51] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You've played some good games this month
[5:01:56] <Coystick> I want NG+
[5:02:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> every catholic relic is some old dude's bone or some shit
[5:02:05] <%NeroInfinite> "here's this unwashed shroud that jesus woreon his deaht bed."
[5:02:07] <TheDr0t> any particulate reason with the cone head?
[5:02:14] <+jetjagger222> heretic hat
[5:02:19] <%Nina96> i want new NG-
[5:02:22] <%NeroInfinite> "here's the fingerbone of ome saint"
[5:02:24] <LodiFrostbeard> i hope they do DLC for this
[5:02:26] <pabloelenano2> @Coystick i dont see a need for ng+ in this game
[5:02:27] <%dukenux> heres a sandal of Saint Jimmy
[5:02:30] <deviljhojho94> big cones for big boys
[5:02:34] <Mendin> It's called a Capirote
[5:02:37] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> really?
[5:02:39] <+Ez3z> it's a dunce cap?
[5:02:40] <%nofestu2> its a hat for penance
[5:02:41] <TheDr0t> so main character bad?
[5:02:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> Holy shit I had no idea.
[5:02:44] <+Zereaux> its called the new testment
[5:02:45] <bear_breaker20> IE: Dunce cap
[5:02:46] <astrophizz> so ThAT'S what that SNL conehead skit is about
[5:02:46] <+Pyroclase> BG+ isn't DLC, it's a feature
[5:02:48] <Morbidmort> @TheDr0t Flagellants, Heretics, Crusaders and Spanish Catholicism
[5:02:56] <+jetjagger222> the penintent one is trying to undo the miracle
[5:02:56] <%dukenux> thats where Dunce Cap might have originated from
[5:03:01] <+jetjagger222> hence, "blasphemous"
[5:03:02] <%StaceMcGate> Worst and Best
[5:03:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> honesly I know nothing about this game, I get that gross shit is a thing and all but like.... EVERYTHING? does EVERY fuckin thing gotta be hair or guts or some shit...
[5:03:08] <shevan123> it was used for those who were part of the saints week procession
[5:03:10] <deviljhojho94> I mean, this society has some rather twisted morals
[5:03:11] <Crushter> @TheDr0t he's a penitent, sworn to silence. The Miracle made that very literal, hence his quest to fix things
[5:03:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat WTF are these random blood platforms and where do they come from??
[5:03:25] <%NeroInfinite> Welcome to relgion man
[5:03:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Grievous Miracle, where General Grievous didn't die
[5:03:39] <Mendin> @Bane_Kaikyo Renaissance Spanish Catholic Guilt & Punishment is a hell f an aesthetic
[5:03:41] <+Pyroclase> this music is lovely
[5:03:44] <%floralkami> @bane_kaikyo again, that was religion. have you read berserk
[5:03:48] <Crushter> @FirearmsInstructor they are placed purposefully and only appear if you have a bloody sand relic
[5:03:52] <%floralkami> *?
[5:03:57] <pabloelenano2> @FirearmsInstructor blood in sand...lieraly
[5:04:14] <Crushter> hey man, that sand saved that guy's life
[5:04:25] <bear_breaker20> funny how much this looks like jump king now
[5:04:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Bane_Kaikyo Pretty much. All of these things have some meaning in religion usually, so you amp that up to 11 because of some weird religious curse, and everythings all gross and stuff. It's also metal as fuck.
[5:04:30] <+jetjagger222> track name is "gelida expiracion"
[5:04:30] <+cvp5127> no stream thurdays?
[5:04:38] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Crushter @pabloelenano2 Ah ok. I missed him getting that relic in that part of the LP. Thanks. :)
[5:04:40] <TheDr0t> that adds so much more lore to that awful dan aykroyd movie with cone heads
[5:04:42] <%firehawk_420> Anyone here ever had chest pain, center of the chest, that only hurts when you stretch or strain and cracks/pops when you stretch?
[5:04:50] <Jolnir> oh my god the music in this game
[5:04:54] <pabloelenano2> np man
[5:05:01] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you can fire the projectile in air, you can even do it after you perform the air rekas
[5:05:17] <Crushter> for a 4/5 hit combo
[5:05:19] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 yeah, you work out infrequently?
[5:05:19] <+Estuko> @TheDr0t Awful?
[5:05:19] <LodiFrostbeard> @firehawk_420 probably indigestion, if it persists go to the doctor just in case
[5:05:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @firehawk_420 Yes. Several times. I'm still alive though so, you might be fine lol.
[5:05:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @firehawk_420 yeah, uh. see a doctor. probably muscle related
[5:05:31] <+jetjagger222> check out the death animation on the coffin guys
[5:05:31] <$Cthulos> Weak chest muscles
[5:05:32] <+Zereaux> @chat anyone know if there is like an art book for this coming out?
[5:05:34] <%firehawk_420> I have no insurance so I’ve been neglecting getting it looked at
[5:05:44] <Crushter> @Zereaux it comes with the Delux edition
[5:05:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ok, everyone is just screaming at me that it's gross because religion... That does kinda makes sense, I really wasn't even thinking about the name of the game so It didn't occur to me
[5:05:48] <Crushter> along with the skin, ost and comic
[5:06:07] <%TheBitingIrish> @firehawk_420 Is it IN the chest, or just your sternum?
[5:06:11] <TheDr0t> @Estuko conehead were he was chewing a condom? yeah hella bad movie
[5:06:22] <LodiFrostbeard> @firehawk_420 you think it could be a heart thing?
[5:06:28] <deviljhojho94> hell of a game baby
[5:06:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> ???
[5:06:33] <%FirearmsInstructor> Good controls?
[5:06:41] <%Laecerelius> fucking not-spawning bitch-ass ghosts!
[5:06:44] <%firehawk_420> Feels like it’s in my sternum or like right behind the bone
[5:06:44] <+Pyroclase> heal pat
[5:06:47] <+Estuko> @TheDr0t I thought it was funny, but I also saw that movie several years ago when I was a smaller lass... lol FeelsBadMan
[5:06:51] <Crushter> There's no more roots up here, but there is the gas room below the bonfire. The other root thing is near Gemino
[5:07:00] <deviljhojho94> looks way better too
[5:07:03] <$Cthulos> if you stretch arms out to the side does it pop and the pain go away?
[5:07:06] <%StaceMcGate> Was this a kickstarter?
[5:07:07] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Bloodstained looked kinda jank.
[5:07:09] <%Maids4lyfe> heal?
[5:07:10] <Crushter> yes

[5:07:18] <Mendin> This game is Good. Once it gets a patch or two for polishing up its weird mechanics quirks and bugs, it will be Great
[5:07:18] <%KoyaMusa> PAT
[5:07:18] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 i think ive had those same pains before, after putting more into my chest exercises. have you been drinking enough water and staying away from salt?

[5:07:28] <Jolnir> metroidvaniasouls THE GAME
[5:07:29] <%Hydrapissed> LoL
[5:07:29] <DraxTD> ah the pain bell
[5:07:29] <%firehawk_420> @cthulos I don’t work out and it happens when I stretch overhead then goes away
[5:07:34] <Crushter> @FirearmsInstructor that mob's flail is a hurtbox even when static
[5:07:35] <%cherubs_anonymous> F
[5:07:36] <+jetjagger222> just ran into the people jar

[5:07:40] <Daigrey> the power of Christ fucking compelled you!!!
[5:07:42] <DraxTD> DO you??
[5:07:46] <+SamleyTimes> save deleted
[5:07:52] <Mendin> Just the tip PogChamp
[5:07:56] <TheHeroAppears> that's what you always say pat :sad:
[5:08:00] <+prism_zet> I like that his stinger has a buster sword shape
[5:08:02] <+Estuko> @Daigrey the power of Christ CRUSHES YOU
[5:08:03] <%firehawk_420> I’m on mobile guys so it’s hard to keep up with these responses but I am reading them
[5:08:04] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 do you eat a lot lf salt?
[5:08:06] <bear_breaker20> trust us were not worried Kappa
[5:08:11] <Crushter> @prism_zet it gets bigger later too :u
[5:08:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Crushter damn lol I didn't even see it. I blinked and reached for my water
[5:08:15] <$Cthulos> @firehawk_420 probably need to do some stretching and light exercising. just weak chest muscles but I am no doctor
[5:08:19] <Pyrrhus90> nun > pat
[5:08:22] <%firehawk_420> @floralkami more than I should
[5:08:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Crushter He was literally sliding along then covering his mouth and it was like DEAD
[5:08:32] <%StaceMcGate> Nun has more kills on Pat than any boss
[5:08:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @firehawk_420 Could be you have a loose valve on your stomache. Lets out a little bit of acid when you stretch. I could be wrong though.
[5:08:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Butt juice. Don't drink this.
[5:08:51] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> crazy talk
[5:08:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @firehawk_420 you can get injured from muscle atrophy. i.e. injured from nothing, it's cumulative
[5:08:58] <$Cthulos> sucks living in the states where they're ridiculous for their medical costs
[5:08:59] <Kristoffers> I'm looking at Blasphemous' kickstarter trailer right now and it's got hilariously many enemies on screen at the same time. Blasphemous musou
[5:09:00] <Crushter> i still recommend not sliding attacking them
[5:09:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> RTSR
[5:09:04] <%firehawk_420> @cthulos I’ll try that, thank you.
[5:09:07] <Mendin> Red tearstone
[5:09:09] <%Hydrapissed> Red RONG
[5:09:10] <Ominnous> red tearstone
[5:09:10] <Crushter> its better than the parry
[5:09:12] <+prism_zet> @Crushter oh damn, that's sick, i'll have to grab this once i'm done with RiverCityGirls
[5:09:12] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> speedrun item
[5:09:16] <%Hydrapissed> best ring in the game callin it now
[5:09:16] <%firehawk_420> And yeah I’m in the states without insurance so fuck me
[5:09:19] <%Hydrapissed> speed run time
[5:09:22] <Crushter> the parry is lame and you can learn to not use it
[5:09:26] <Crushter> :u
[5:09:26] <+Pyroclase> that might be amazing depending on the stretngth of the damage buff
[5:09:31] <+Pyroclase> it could be double for all you know
[5:09:31] <Louie_Salmon> That's weird, that one doesn't have a downside
[5:09:35] <+SamleyTimes> nah
[5:09:35] <%KoyaMusa> just be good at the game
[5:09:37] <%HyraFukit> Pat you need to parry to benefit from parrying
[5:09:40] <Mendin> The downside is being nearly dead
[5:09:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @firehawk_420 there are clinics that take patients with no insurance. you just need to pay upfront. though it is more of an non-emergency deal.
[5:09:43] <%WhereIsWill> read lore?
[5:09:44] <TheHeroAppears> you know uh... close
[5:09:44] <%Hydrapissed> 1 percent
[5:09:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> @prism_zet How'd you like RCG?
[5:09:47] <Crushter> decent
[5:09:50] <%TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat Have you backed up your save receently?
[5:09:57] <Ominnous> I... I don't think this item is for you
[5:10:03] <Crushter> ah yeah the lore on this item is great
[5:10:04] <%firehawk_420> Thanks for advice guys
[5:10:10] <$Cthulos> @firehawk_420 get something for insurance if you can afford it. even if it's benefits from work
[5:10:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @TheBitingIrish How do you back up Manual? (Is it a local save file somewhere?)
[5:10:15] <Louie_Salmon> That's always the problem with these items, it never says how close to death or how much it increases whatever
[5:10:19] <+Estuko> @Cthulos it's frightening, I drove myself to emergency room once when I had a fencing accident during a tournament. (blade snapped from too much bending, went into my shoulder)
[5:10:20] <$Cthulos> better than nothing
[5:10:28] <+Estuko> no way I'd call an ambulance
[5:10:29] <Crushter> @AngriestPat that's about the Saltpeter guy in the Dream, he literally asked them to take him to heaven to stop seeing everyone's sins
[5:10:36] <%arancet> twitch doctor cures another patient
[5:10:46] <$Cthulos> yeah It's 200 here in canada
[5:10:55] <%Hydrapissed> does any one actually know the stats on it?
[5:10:56] <$Cthulos> cannot even imagine it in the states
[5:10:57] <Crushter> Go back near gemino
[5:10:59] <%TheBitingIrish> @FirearmsInstructor Dunno, I don't have the game. Just check the usual spots
[5:11:03] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 you need to cut down the salt and drink more water especially
[5:11:05] <+prism_zet> @FirearmsInstructor Love it so far, i'm streaming it lazily. I love solid beat em ups. This definitely has the snap/pop of scott pilgrim, but better moves and better humour, soundtrack is bomb too.
[5:11:10] <Crushter> @Hydrapissed nobody's got hard numbers atm
[5:11:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Yeah, not having insurance sucks. I've done some shit to avoid going in lol.
[5:11:14] <$Cthulos> what floralkami said
[5:11:15] <+jetjagger222> tree dude
[5:11:24] <%Hydrapissed> @Crushter dang
[5:11:24] <Mendin> Oh yeah above him that spot you couldnt jump good to
[5:11:34] <Crushter> You can test it by using the health bead though @Hydrapissed
[5:11:39] <Crushter> and you can hurt yourself on demand
[5:11:46] <Pyrrhus90> he must feel lonely BibleThump
[5:11:48] <Crushter> so it's possible to activate it on demand
[5:11:50] <+jetjagger222> bless you
[5:11:55] <Zooperton> gesundheit
[5:11:56] <%Hydrapissed> whats ur guess on the damage boost crushter?
[5:11:57] <Crushter> @Pyrrhus90 oh no, he's in heaven now
[5:12:00] <%luckysteak> remember how impossible this was at the beginning, pat?
[5:12:00] <%floralkami> Bless you,
[5:12:07] <$Cthulos> some exercise even if it's like 10 minutes of jogging/speed walking then do the stretches and do other exercises until you get used to it
[5:12:12] <Crushter> @Hydrapissed probably about... 10/20 percent?
[5:12:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Begone demon!
[5:12:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @prism_zet yea the track is amazing. River City Ransom is one of the first console video games I played when I was little, and I loved it. Super nostalgic and probably my first "favorite" game. (Or up there.)
[5:12:18] <%Hydrapissed> danggg 20 percent
[5:12:18] <%firehawk_420> @floralkami alright, I’ll do that and start exercising some.
[5:12:20] <%StaceMcGate> Ghost Swarm
[5:12:25] <$Cthulos> it might be worth investing in a trainer if you can afford it
[5:12:25] <Crushter> It's hard to tell
[5:12:36] <Crushter> have faith
[5:12:40] <%Hydrapissed> is it all damage?
[5:12:41] <Crushter> I love that bridge
[5:12:46] <$Cthulos> do not go hard if you are not used to it
[5:12:53] <Crushter> that one you might like more @AngriestPat
[5:12:59] <+Pyroclase> is that an actual lady in that shrine?
[5:13:00] <Crushter> esp if you like spells
[5:13:05] <TheDr0t> is mana works like dt gage ?
[5:13:06] <$Cthulos> you will likely get hurt but some exercise is better than nothing
[5:13:11] <%waltzqueen> @Pyroclase thats a jesus
[5:13:14] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 even when it sucks, some squats and stretches each morning ot night makes a world of difference
[5:13:15] <%firehawk_420> @cthulos I’m in between jobs so spending money on anything other then food and necessities isn’t an option at the moment
[5:13:15] <Mendin> Get more mana, your projectile is weaker
[5:13:17] <%StaceMcGate> more mp, weaker range
[5:13:18] <pabloelenano2> lore
[5:13:19] <+prism_zet> @FirearmsInstructor it was one of the first games i ever had emulated haha, i never had nintendo as a kid, all sega. That and super dodgeball were games me and friends played for yeeeears.
[5:13:20] <$Cthulos> eat healthy and drink loooooots of water
[5:13:21] <Crushter> sonic booms go down, but way more spell gain
[5:13:30] <%Hydrapissed> so more booms over wall but less damage
[5:13:34] <%Hydrapissed> all*
[5:13:36] <Mendin> Oh yeah go down there in the cave
[5:13:38] <$Cthulos> get used to going to the washroom
[5:13:40] <Mendin> The olive cave bottom left
[5:13:41] <Crushter> yeah
[5:13:47] <Crushter> no that was the thing
[5:13:47] <Louie_Salmon> That seems useless for Pat, he's always at full fervor anyway
[5:13:54] <Crushter> this is just near gemino, so I used him as reference
[5:13:55] <%firehawk_420> So, basically, stop being a lazy, unhealthy piece of shit? Lol
[5:14:05] <Crushter> you need an item to do that @AngriestPat don't try it until then
[5:14:10] <$Cthulos> something is better than nothing
[5:14:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @prism_zet Yea I never owned a NES. My friends did. I actually bought a copy of RCR and still own it and have it, but no NES, lol. Always intended to buy one, but never did, and have the game.
[5:14:18] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 cut the bread and dairy out and get used to cooking mostly meat and veggies. it saves money too, as I'm currently doing
[5:14:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> this part made me so mad lol
[5:14:37] <%StaceMcGate> heal
[5:14:39] <Crushter> oh yeah you can get the bone you missed
[5:14:48] <Crushter> no
[5:14:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @firehawk_420 lol kinda. 30 minutes of walking a day, some pushups, squats, crunches, and sky divers will work all your muscle groups and get you going in a good place for free in your own room.
[5:14:51] <Mendin> What no you dont
[5:14:53] <%Calek> no you can get it
[5:14:54] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you can get the bone
[5:14:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @prism_zet Blew my mind when I found the secret shop on the black / underground road / highway section by mistake.
[5:14:56] <+SamleyTimes> no
[5:14:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> you don't need an item
[5:15:00] <$Cthulos> some carbs are still good, but definitely see if you can get some insurance but I don't know what to look for there
[5:15:01] <+nekodelic> no you don't need it
[5:15:03] <+Pyroclase> yoiu need a serious healing buff
[5:15:05] <%floralkami> @firehawk_420 well, laziness is and is caused by unhealthy shit, sooo
[5:15:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> we're not one guy
[5:15:11] <$Cthulos> yup
[5:15:11] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you need an item to survive the fall down place
[5:15:18] <%TheBitingIrish> @FirearmsInstructor You could probably buy one of those custom multi-platform players
[5:15:22] <Crushter> otherwise the pit will kill u
[5:15:22] <Mendin> Pat knows what he's doing? Bahahaha
[5:15:26] <+Deathtronhammer> But does Pat know what he's chewing?
[5:15:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> @TheBitingIrish ??
[5:15:48] <Crushter> the uppercut is so godly
[5:15:54] <+prism_zet> @FirearmsInstructor See, i only knew about that because of scott pilgrim years later :D :D :D hahaha made me go back and play it some more, deep old school game
[5:15:54] <Crushter> got a kill on a boss with it today
[5:15:55] <Sapphire_Breeze> this jump right here doodCrazy
[5:15:57] <katocrimson> nice raw piano music
[5:15:57] <Crushter> mwah
[5:16:04] <%floralkami> @king_wolf_rigger i need to do more skydivers, back fat is the WORST
[5:16:12] <Mendin> That is a very precise jump
[5:16:14] <%Calek> that jump is actual booty
[5:16:16] <%mh9s> excellent
[5:16:16] <Mendin> It's a Megaman level one
[5:16:28] <Crushter> @AngriestPat no that's where the normally instant death pit fall takes you, hence my reference to an item
[5:16:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami Don't I know it. I find that weight training is the fastest way to burn fat.
[5:16:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> PogChamp
[5:16:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> @prism_zet it was in SP? I don't remember that. lol I found it when I was 8 or something. I was like "I NEED TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS!!" D: lol
[5:16:43] <Crushter> you don't need Gemino's help to get down here, but it's later
[5:16:56] <Mendin> Delicious coccyx
[5:17:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No u
[5:17:08] <Crushter> or you get gemino to help and u skip it to early
[5:17:16] <+Zereaux> thats a title daniel the possessed
[5:17:31] <alexandrecau> the ass bone of a possed dude
[5:17:34] <Crushter> @AngriestPat if you didn't get the guts, make sure you do, and drop them off
[5:17:36] <ZE_Count> I wanna see Anor Londo
[5:17:36] <+Pyroclase> wasteland of the buried churches holy shit
[5:17:36] <BeautifulDuwang4> ooo He's playing Blasphemous How 's he enjoyiing it so far?
[5:17:41] <+Zereaux> what about bone lore pat
[5:17:42] <%floralkami> @king_wolf_rigger same, tho if only cardio was easier to get started
[5:17:47] <+Estuko> CRUNCH
[5:17:53] <%firehawk_420> Thanks for the advice guys, i’ll try to work on my diet and start exercising. This is a good motivator to improve these things lol
[5:17:56] <Mendin> You got the guts originally
[5:17:56] <LodiFrostbeard> @BeautifulDuwang4 he likes it a lot
[5:17:57] <+jetjagger222> gattsu
[5:17:58] <Crushter> they're below the entrance to the Sorrows chapel
[5:17:59] <Pyrrhus90> GATSU
[5:18:02] <%Laecerelius> You need big guts!
[5:18:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> let me get up in them guts
[5:18:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> Gattsu
[5:18:03] <Crushter> right there
[5:18:05] <%grayjammer> pat stopped reading bonelore
[5:18:08] <dan_g_v> well he is stomping on the sinners, so i guess he is enjoying it
[5:18:14] <katocrimson> get the griffth
[5:18:18] <+nekodelic> pat doesn't have the guts
[5:18:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> Gattsu obtained
[5:18:28] <Mendin> Goddammit crazy talk is infecting chat
[5:18:31] <Sapphire_Breeze> nice save
[5:18:38] <StarsCrusader> So close
[5:18:41] <%waltzqueen> Carnal Remains implies this is her genitals
[5:18:42] <%Maids4lyfe> apatCrazy
[5:18:44] <Crushter> enjoy the stronkest miracle
[5:18:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It's pronounced G A T S U
[5:18:51] <+prism_zet> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah theres a hidden shop in a roadside wall in scott pilgrim too, suddenly clicked for me when i saw that.
[5:18:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami I not only dislike doing cardio, it's just a flat out waste of time from the perspective of losing weight. You can get cardio as a byproduct of doing super sets anyways, which I absolutely love lol.
[5:19:05] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you missed two items in Jondo as well, if you want them
[5:19:07] <BeautifulDuwang4> @LodiFrostbeard im waiting to get this game myself. Been looking into it since i heard about it
[5:19:07] <Mendin> That's a gate you cant open yet pat
[5:19:11] <LodiFrostbeard> thats a locked door
[5:19:13] <%TheBitingIrish> @FirearmsInstructor Check Amazon for combo consoles
[5:19:14] <%WhereIsWill> that stinger is soo good
[5:19:22] <+prism_zet> @FirearmsInstructor "hidden" is loose though, its pretty easy to notice cause it glows all bright and opens when you're near it
[5:19:42] <Crushter> one is really good, the other is okay, but the fact that you can't combo with it on is lame
[5:19:47] <+Mitchellsocks> That tower always looks like the undead settlement tower, but with cathedral of the deep in mid ground, and irythll in background
[5:19:51] <implied_consent> Are you going for the good ending, pat?
[5:19:56] <%mh9s> they pop so good
[5:20:07] <%Kev1n36> what is this game?
[5:20:07] <%floralkami> @king_wolf_rigger yeah, but my legs make me feel like a tank type when my body type should is a beast type at worst, agile at best
[5:20:08] <TheDr0t> there reeposts in this game?
[5:20:10] <Crushter> if he figures it out why not, I don't think he wants smoils though
[5:20:13] <%StaceMcGate> brutal
[5:20:14] <%Kev1n36> is this dead cells 2?
[5:20:16] <Pyrrhus90> YEYEYEYE
[5:20:17] <+Estuko> WOAH
[5:20:17] <%Maids4lyfe> THAT WAS SO COOL
[5:20:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> jesus fuck
[5:20:25] <Mendin> Spanish Catholic Bloodborne Metroidvania
[5:20:25] <LodiFrostbeard> @implied_consent doubt he knows how to get it, he hasn't been fucking with the statues
[5:20:26] <%mh9s> YEYEYEYE
[5:20:35] <ZE_Count> 8k
[5:20:41] <Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard the hint is with the pure bead anyway
[5:20:41] <pabloelenano2> yeah geting executions in some enemies is hard
[5:20:47] <%Kev1n36> is this related to dead cells or does it just really look like it
[5:20:52] <TheDr0t> art thou mad brother?
[5:20:52] <Mendin> Unrelated
[5:20:54] <Crushter> BASED DEBLA
[5:20:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> big laser
[5:21:01] <LodiFrostbeard> @Crushter it's obtuse tho
[5:21:01] <BeautifulDuwang4> @Kev1n36 unrelated
[5:21:02] <%StaceMcGate> AOE
[5:21:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> THE LIGHTS IS ON!
[5:21:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the lights is out
[5:21:05] <%Kev1n36> damn even the little dash animation looked like dead cells
[5:21:11] <%Calek> blind me up inside
[5:21:12] <+jetjagger222> its a eurobeat song
[5:21:15] <+Walopoh> Can't wait for Blasphemous 2: New World Genocide Boogaloo

[5:21:22] <astrophizz> power geyser
[5:21:23] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat eyyy I was hoping you'd still be on after I got done streaming rooty-tooty-point-and-shooty (RDR2). How's it been going so far?
[5:21:24] <Pyrrhus90> ANIMEEE
[5:21:25] <Morbidmort> That is a boss move
[5:21:29] <%Laecerelius> PRAYER GUYSAH!
[5:21:29] <b1gboss007> exCALIBAAAAAAAA
[5:21:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That's a Metal Slug
[5:21:31] <%Calek> and it costs nothing
[5:21:32] <dan_g_v> ok then!
[5:21:34] <%Calek> that's nutty
[5:21:38] <%TheBitingIrish> POWUH GUYZER
[5:21:43] <BeautifulDuwang4> recently played Dead Cells that's very fun as well
[5:21:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Gon be his Final Smash prolly
[5:21:46] <%firehawk_420> I gotta feed my kitties. They’re all staring at me intently.
[5:21:47] <thegrapist__> was pat just reading some slam poetry?
[5:21:47] <Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard Not particularly, they put the item in front of a guilt statue, if you break a statue there's an impassable thing, and the bead stains quickly
[5:21:49] <Pyrrhus90> spanish terry then?
[5:21:50] <implied_consent> That's a boss move
[5:21:52] <Crushter> but i unno
[5:21:56] <ZE_Count> got any more spices?
[5:21:57] <Trash_leviathan> powah guyzah
[5:22:03] <%StaceMcGate> Does Spain like Terry as well?
[5:22:20] <%Hydrapissed> is this anor jondo?
[5:22:26] <LodiFrostbeard> @Crushter i only figured it out after getting the bad ending, he might get it tho, he smart
[5:22:32] <%floralkami> @bane_kaikyo doubt it, it might be his down special
[5:22:40] <%Kev1n36> that slide animation is very dead cells
[5:22:40] <%TheBitingIrish> Isn't it pronounced 'Hondo'?
[5:22:41] <Crushter> @AngriestPat the items are both top of Jondo, one left and one at the entrance
[5:22:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> @TheBitingIrish holy shit dude what is this path you've shown me lol
[5:22:46] <+jetjagger222> E. Hondo
[5:22:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami For that, I suggest going for a hyper-enduro styled weight training series. Two sets of 20 to 40 reps. Creates long, lean muscle that has good reflexes and doesn't exhaust easily. combine that with a total body workout superset to improve cardio, and you'll be feeling fast af.
[5:22:59] <+Pyroclase> that stupidly big bell is my new favorite thing
[5:23:01] <Mendin> E. Jondo
[5:23:11] <Crushter> @Pyroclase stupid big, upside down bell

[5:25:29] <Crushter> @AngriestPat the Sisters *became* that thing
[5:25:44] <spinbel> ?
[5:25:49] <StarsCrusader> He's just there
[5:25:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he wanted pies
[5:25:55] <TwinBat> he was ten pid dads
[5:25:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> he wanted 10 pies
[5:26:00] <Mendin> I think it was just a nightmare of the Sleeping Saint in the Ruined Church
[5:26:01] <Coystick> He likes Pies, and Dads
[5:26:02] <+jetjagger222> it was a pieta reference
[5:26:06] <LodiFrostbeard> I'll wait for the vaati videos
[5:26:07] <Pyrrhus90> not hot enough to be god
[5:26:08] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat well, he was a dad who wanted Ten Pies. Nobody liked that so they stuck him in the basement.
[5:26:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Ten Piedad was a twisted form of Woolie where the bug bites took hold.
[5:26:16] <%SwdVengeance> Pie Dad?
[5:26:17] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Ten Piedad is the priest, or was the priest of the chapel
[5:26:21] <Ominnous> that's as many as 10 pies and that's horrible
[5:26:21] <Sapphire_Breeze> woolie demon
[5:26:23] <%mh9s> they were evil pies
[5:26:24] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> woolie?
[5:26:36] <%NWR_James> NO! Elmo feets go where they want
[5:26:36] <+jetjagger222> he was being punished for the eeevils of premarital sex
[5:26:40] <BeautifulDuwang4> How very oxymoronic that the Plague in this game is called "The Miracle"
[5:26:41] <LodiFrostbeard> @AngriestPat doesn't make sense in spanish either, can confirm
[5:26:48] <Crushter> you mostly do
[5:26:49] <Coystick> Oh woah a Woolie joke was just staring us in the face
[5:26:49] <Pyrrhus90> woolie's nemesis
[5:26:53] <+Zereaux> woolie is gonna have so much fun with the names in this game @AngriestPat
[5:26:54] <Pyrrhus90> his vergil to his dante
[5:26:54] <Mendin> There is no plague, what do you speak of
[5:26:55] <%Andrizzleton> PIEDAD is piety no?
[5:27:09] <alexandrecau> piedad is mercy
[5:27:11] <%StaceMcGate> Have Mercy
[5:27:14] <LodiFrostbeard> @Andrizzleton means mercy
[5:27:17] <%KoyaMusa> no it means "have mercy"
[5:27:19] <Pyrrhus90> have mercy or have piety
[5:27:19] <pabloelenano2> @BeautifulDuwang4 not really...
[5:27:22] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it means "have mercy" or "be merciful"
[5:27:22] <ZE_Count> I think some lroe out there that tells ya
[5:27:22] <Pyrrhus90> both are valid
[5:27:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> Speaking of pies; what's Woolie's favorite kind?
[5:27:26] <ZE_Count> Lore*
[5:27:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the cheevo for killing him was "No Mercy"
[5:27:27] <Crushter> @AngriestPat also look at the name of the Church he's in
[5:27:37] <+jetjagger222> mercy dreams

[5:27:52] <implied_consent> "Ten piedad" means "have mercy" in spanish
[5:27:53] <%floralkami> @beautifulduwang4 ..... you mean ironic. oxymoronic means a word that explains a sound.

[5:28:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> puh-teena
[5:28:48] <%FirearmsInstructor> Did Pat grow his rosary bead capacity yet?
[5:28:50] <ZE_Count> Pelicans are total bros!
[5:28:54] <Crushter> you can't combo with the other miracle
[5:28:56] <%thomsato> thomsato subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! yes lad
[5:29:00] <+jetjagger222> i-frames
[5:29:02] <%TheBitingIrish> snazzy
[5:29:03] <%StaceMcGate> Chat without spoiling, the true ending is a pain in the ass yeah?
[5:29:06] <alexandrecau> oxymoron is a figure of speech that contradict
[5:29:08] <+jetjagger222> yes it is
[5:29:08] <%floralkami> @alexandrecau look at me, loud and wrong...
[5:29:14] <Mendin> A miracle you dont have
[5:29:14] <%Calek> @StaceMcGate nah it's ezpz to get
[5:29:14] <BeautifulDuwang4> @StaceMcGate yes
[5:29:18] <Mendin> Dont worry bout ti
[5:29:23] <+jetjagger222> its a hassle to backtrack
[5:29:24] <LodiFrostbeard> @StaceMcGate not really
[5:29:26] <pabloelenano2> pointles dont worry
[5:29:28] <+jetjagger222> the actual thing isn't super hard to do
[5:29:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> what miracle, you dont rquip miracles
[5:29:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> No combo? But I like big combo
[5:29:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> this aint dark souls
[5:29:35] <Trash_leviathan> @floralkami oxymoron is a phrase tht uses to word that have opposite meaning
[5:29:41] <Trash_leviathan> two
[5:29:42] <%luftraumm1> @angriestpat iirc there's an item with a description that infers ten piedad grew around a heretic, and he's still in there, alive as punishment. also ten piedad is a reference to Michelangelo's Pietá
[5:29:49] <Crushter> @GiygasDrillBreak eh, I interchange Miracle/Prayer
[5:29:52] <%floralkami> i feel like Bart when he answered a question in class
[5:30:12] <+Mitchellsocks> is Jondo a giant, upside down bell?
[5:30:17] <%floralkami> OVERKILL MUCH?
[5:30:19] <Crushter> @Mitchellsocks yes
[5:30:21] <Mendin> Yes. Yes it is.
[5:30:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes jondo is a giant upside down bell
[5:30:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> getsuga tensho?
[5:30:44] <Crushter> @AngriestPat that's what I meant, you can't combo with that on, but you do get big damage buff
[5:30:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What happened to your magic bar? It's only 2 big sections now.
[5:30:51] <alexandrecau> you robbed solaire
[5:30:51] <TheDr0t> excommunicado
[5:30:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> i don't get it
[5:30:55] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[5:31:07] <Ominnous> when you fear the miracle more than hell
[5:31:09] <%StaceMcGate> but numbers go down
[5:31:16] <Crushter> @AngriestPat funnily enough, the combo does more damage than that ever will
[5:31:17] <GiygasDrillBreak> prayers change the sections of fervor gauge
[5:31:29] <BeautifulDuwang4> I mean...We've seen what the Miracle is capable of doing
[5:31:30] <%Calek> good bye John Doe
[5:31:32] <FranticFicus> Do you say that Blasphemous is better or worse than Hollow Knight?
[5:31:34] <+nekodelic> there's a baby in Jondo you didn't get
[5:31:36] <+GalacticaPhanto> I wonder when someone will edit Pat's face on the mask
[5:31:43] <Crushter> IMO they should've replaced your attacks with a big overhead or something that did big damage with the miracle
[5:31:52] <+Estuko> purpose of kiling burning peasants?
[5:31:58] <worldbrand> What a mysterious jondo
[5:32:01] <Mendin> Sin and Punishment
[5:32:02] <Crushter> @Estuko fun?
[5:32:05] <%Dakuu75> Man, put these poor ass-holes outa their missery pat. jsut leaving them their to burn
[5:32:06] <+Estuko> LUL
[5:32:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> Hollow Knight is a bigger game with more polish
[5:32:15] <Pyrrhus90> good luck baby
[5:32:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> there's another for the pat quotes
[5:32:17] <%Maids4lyfe> killing the burning peasants is a nice thing to do
[5:32:25] <+Estuko> So just breaking pots, PERFECT
[5:32:26] <TwinBat> that's a good out of context pat quote
[5:32:26] <Crushter> @Estuko there's also items that give you benefits for destroying objects
[5:32:30] <%floralkami> i mean, they are already dead where they are
[5:32:36] <%StaceMcGate> how does the miracle explain minotaurs with javelins?
[5:32:42] <+jetjagger222> being burned at the stake is a rough way to go
[5:32:42] <%Maids4lyfe> god
[5:32:42] <BeautifulDuwang4> Both this and HK are both great in their own matter
[5:32:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I miss the days of mysterious jogo
[5:32:50] <Mendin> Helmets and weird mountain people
[5:32:51] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate ever hear of Moloch?
[5:32:53] <LodiFrostbeard> @GiygasDrillBreak comparing anything to hollow knight is unfair, that game is a masterpiece
[5:32:56] <+Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger I miss gully gully
[5:33:01] <+NerdOfPrey9000> just installed this game yesterday but i am too afraid to play because i know i will suck ass at it
[5:33:02] <%StaceMcGate> @Crushter no, enlighten me
[5:33:10] <%Andrizzleton> I tried to go back to bloodstained after playing this and YIKES
[5:33:22] <GiygasDrillBreak> Hollow Knight only costs $20 for base game and DLC, Blasphemous costs $25
[5:33:29] <+NerdOfPrey9000> i thought blodstained was pretty good?
[5:33:33] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate Basically a bull god, people would sacrifice people by putting them inside of a metal bull and lighting a fire underneath it
[5:33:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko oh my god, I forgot about that. Fuckin helicopters as gully gully lol.
[5:33:37] <%RubberFistFight> @GiygasDrillBreak it's worth every cent though
[5:33:38] <%firehawk_420> @angriestpat how much longer do you think your gonna go for?
[5:33:40] <%lethallunacyx> jeez
[5:33:42] <+jetjagger222> bafmodad
[5:33:44] <GeneralUile42> use magic
[5:33:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Isn't Moloch a Goetia demon?
[5:33:47] <%reneries> reneries subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:33:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> so, dollar to dollar, Hollow Knight is a better game, but i like Blasphemous more
[5:33:49] <+Pyroclase> Wait, he's in.. the suburbs?
[5:33:49] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat try using your AOE
[5:33:51] <FranticFicus> nice execution animation :o
[5:33:52] <%Dakuu75> @AngriestPat does your projecile go through walls? can open that door with it?
[5:33:54] <%QueequegTheater> consider the egg
[5:33:56] <Crushter> @Sphincter_Spelunker he was turned into one
[5:33:57] <+GalacticaPhanto> I love Bloodstained and I do like this as well, each artstyle is good
[5:34:01] <worldbrand> Moloch is absolutely a demon name i recognize
[5:34:05] <%StaceMcGate> @Crushter ah, I thought that was just torture. Didn't know it was religious
[5:34:08] <%Dakuu75> damn
[5:34:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> Moloch isnt goetia
[5:34:13] <%Divryne> 5 AM.
[5:34:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Crushter Pretty sure the only person to die in the brass bull was the guy who made it for that fucked up king.
[5:34:19] <%Divryne> Hollow Knight stream is NOW.
[5:34:23] <Pyrrhus90> nope
[5:34:25] <Crushter> @King_Wolf_Rigger no it was used for more than the one guy
[5:34:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> hmm
[5:34:34] <shevan123> some demon names were after pagan gods the philistines worshiped
[5:34:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> have to do more reading
[5:34:43] <%StaceMcGate> but the guy who created the bull was its first victim yeah?
[5:34:44] <Crushter> gotta feed them babies and people to the bull god
[5:34:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, he died first
[5:34:53] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate according to myth, anyway
[5:34:58] <%Laecerelius> Elmo attack!
[5:34:59] <worldbrand> @shevan123 plenty of saints, too
[5:35:01] <+Deathtronhammer> Love stab
[5:35:12] <+GalacticaPhanto> would you say this is much more difficult than Hollow Knight or closer to a slightly harder SotN
[5:35:34] <Crushter> alright gonna start my fast run while listening
[5:35:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, Moloch is a Canaanite thing. I love that Christians shit talked Canaanites Gods like Baal
[5:35:49] <Crushter> @GalacticaPhanto I'd call it a hard SoTN/PoR
[5:35:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> fuckin lovin FFXIV so far.

[5:42:02] <Mendin> Yeah this guy is a BIG step up from the three mandatory bosses
[5:42:09] <Crushter> @MoraMiarty well he did get two cutscenes previously
[5:42:12] <GiygasDrillBreak> i didnt have pelican for this fight
[5:42:17] <%MoraMiarty> I know, I saw them
[5:42:17] <%StaceMcGate> he has alot of health
[5:42:23] <%Andrizzleton> the parry does SO much damage
[5:42:25] <%WhereIsWill> them stinger crossups tho
[5:42:28] <+Solideva> !sellout
[5:42:28] <@Moobot> "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[5:42:30] <Crushter> Pelican isn't needed for this, Esdras gives plenty of time to heal
[5:42:35] <TheDr0t> stage 2
[5:42:40] <Crushter> there's the combo
[5:42:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he's using faith lightning miracles. what a scrub
[5:42:54] <%Calek> don't think there's a fight in the game the pelican is needed but it sure would have helped
[5:43:01] <+prism_zet> that's a spinny lady
[5:43:03] <Crushter> pat needs to uppercut more it does more damage than the standard combo
[5:43:04] <%RubberFistFight> lol tactical healing

[5:44:34] <Coystick> Burned Lady is the only one that's given you trouble
[5:44:36] <Ominnous> @AngriestPat there's no bonus cause you killed her in your first encounter
[5:44:38] <Louie_Salmon> Don't tell him the bonus
[5:44:39] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate Esdras is a Knight of the Anointed, they protect the Mother of Mothers
[5:44:42] <+Pyroclase> kill your enemies with burning oil rags lmao

[5:45:23] <Crushter> TO REDDISH BARK
[5:45:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> you have to kill her at the tree, but killing her when she's summoned by Esdras makes a bonus show up at the tree
[5:45:31] <%Fear_Ranjer> *Oh wow*
[5:45:32] <TheDr0t> real bonus is friends we made along the way @AngriestPat

[5:46:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's more of those, fam
[5:46:42] <Ominnous> @AngriestPat I looked it up after you asked what the 'cost' to summon the boss back, apparently you have to kill her there if you want her item, but you cleared the 1-time boss fight without failing
[5:46:43] <%WhereIsWill> silent steps indeed

[5:50:07] <Ominnous> the strongest of the Miracle's threats
[5:50:10] <Ominnous> gravity
[5:50:11] <Mendin> You don' get a double jump
[5:50:18] <Ominnous> can't parry gravity
[5:50:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I love how someone earlier was surprised Pat died more to platforming than bosses in Hollow Knight
[5:50:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's only 1:50 where Pat is. He must be getting OLD to suck at gaming this early in the day.
[5:50:26] <Mendin> Double jumps are for people WHO AREN'T GIANT SINNERS IN GUILT AND REPENTENCE

[5:51:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter yeah you have to jump super late

[5:58:23] <Crushter> @StaceMcGate nope
[5:58:23] <Ominnous> death flag
[5:58:26] <%Dakuu75> that's somebody's fetish
[5:58:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That thing looks like what happens when you aren't paying attention and the DM has had enough of your shit and makes everything in the room come to life.
[5:58:28] <Mendin> It's another one of those mid-air-bounce-swings, it's terrible
[5:58:39] <sakeydo> Spicy meatball
[5:58:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Big toes are useful. Ask Takamura
[5:58:45] <Crushter> You get another hit in the combo

[6:00:40] <Crushter> @Sphincter_Spelunker that's not how penance works
[6:01:02] <implied_consent> Literally not far off from extremely pious catholicism.

[6:01:51] <beetbo2> the miracle's a curse
[6:01:53] <%Hydrapissed> miracle of pain
[6:02:01] <Mendin> The miracle is why this entire land of holy masochists are eternally punished in creative ways by their guilt

[6:06:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I know the guy gets stabbed through the face, but the knee getting sliced open makes me wince more
[6:06:57] <%Crushter> and you can't do the sonic boom after a ground combo
[6:06:57] <%StaceMcGate> cause that's how miracle works
[6:07:03] <+JacktheMan18> Sucks you can't slide past those big shield guys

[6:13:25] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat ins't there an upgrade to bile flasks? they're getting very weak
[6:13:25] <%Crushter> bonk
[6:13:32] <GiygasDrillBreak> Mother of Mothers is actually 2 zones ahead of the Patio
[6:13:38] <Trash_leviathan> Dr CLONG Md
[6:13:40] <%Crushter> @arfsm95 that's countered by getting like, 10 of em
[6:13:41] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah platform clipping is a little jank in this game
[6:13:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> Library is the proper next level after Patio
[6:13:45] <+prism_zet> bearded children with sticks, the bonkiest enemy
[6:13:47] <alexandrecau> the impaler
[6:14:07] <%Andrizzleton> the one where you are invul while drinking
[6:14:09] <GiygasDrillBreak> that's why when you enter Mother from Patio, you only get early game enemies
[6:14:23] <%StaceMcGate> the penitent man kneels
[6:14:24] <%KoyaMusa> isn't there a shortcut for that room
[6:14:27] <%Dakuu75> I just realized, you're kind of like a religious Pyramid Head
[6:14:27] <Sacksquatch> You should drop the ladder
[6:14:35] <%Crushter> go right
[6:14:46] <+prism_zet> thats a hell of an upper

[6:15:59] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 yeah it goes CLONK
[6:16:07] <Fujiwara_92> where's the style meter when we need it
[6:16:09] <worldbrand> nice
[6:16:16] <%TheBitingIrish> I was 100% expecting him to uppercut into that censer above him
[6:16:22] <%Dakuu75> I meant, can you parry their CLONK lol
[6:16:25] <+prism_zet> tha body
[6:16:41] <%TheBitingIrish> Uh, maybe

[6:18:11] <+NikoliTheBear> PAAAAAT
[6:18:13] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Still going eh?
[6:18:15] <%RubberFistFight> As someone who bought this game, recommended it to Pat, AND alerted him to/helped him with the nastier bugs in it, YES. Fucking buy it, it's goddamn amazing. Plays like butter on the Switch, so if you have one of those, I suggest getting it there.
[6:18:17] <%Crushter> who's talking
[6:18:20] <%StaceMcGate> These guys remind me of Anor Londo archers
[6:18:21] <cureneckbeard> When's Paige finishing Dark Souls 2
[6:18:30] <Ominnous> not enought skeletons to propel paige thru it
[6:18:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when she goes to the eye doctor
[6:18:33] <%Crushter> go right
[6:18:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> this makes me want to get back into salt and sanctuary
[6:18:35] <%Crushter> no enemos
[6:18:39] <SulfurousAcid> When's Paige playing FF4 again?
[6:18:42] <+prism_zet> BONK

[6:18:51] <Mendin> Yang Dead Forever
[6:18:57] <+yoshkosh20> i'm just gonna keep swinging my sword and if you happen to walk into it, it's your own fault
[6:19:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jesus Christ, I forgot Paige was playing FF4
[6:19:03] <cureneckbeard> before or after she gets her glasses
[6:19:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> FF4 is for comfy streams.
[6:19:04] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat I'll give you a hint, think of clemps
[6:19:04] <+prism_zet> aww

[6:24:50] <%RubberFistFight> Oh pat there's a hole in the ground there, watch out Kappa
[6:25:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Only cowards can't parry gravity
[6:25:13] <Ominnous> Pat... my stomach leaped out of my throat when you jumped without looking... and then you just did it again...
[6:25:16] <%Laecerelius> Gravity: Parry this you fucking casual!
[6:25:20] <%RubberFistFight> You're very welcome Pat :P
[6:25:22] <+prism_zet> lolol

[6:25:30] <xnashamin> go to sleep pat
[6:25:38] <%Crushter> also Ultreia Et Susiea means in latin "And go Higher"
[6:25:40] <Mendin> Parrying gravity is how you fly in Douglas Adams' world
[6:25:41] <%NeroInfinite> don't get fucke dup by the altar boys
[6:25:55] <worldbrand> that's less parrying and more forgetting
[6:26:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck those altar boys!

[6:26:37] <TheDr0t> triple kill

[6:26:41] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat the ground spell helps in that room
[6:26:47] <%luftraumm1> should be able to
[6:26:50] <alexandrecau> whatch out pat the chandelier
[6:26:54] <alwayspronking> F
[6:26:54] <+prism_zet> BibleThump
[6:26:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> why is this is so hard? just STOP AND CROUCH in that room
[6:26:58] <%Crushter> the first prayer
[6:27:02] <%luftraumm1> first spell you got
[6:27:03] <%Dakuu75> oh the power-wave I think he means
[6:27:04] <%RubberFistFight> The sword slam that sends out blue waves @AngriestPat
[6:27:13] <%Laecerelius> yeah that sounds like a good plan
[6:27:18] <%Crushter> Also if you want to "slide" through the censer, you have to hold down while sliding
[6:27:23] <%Crushter> at least, in my experience
[6:27:33] <McAngrimStein> bonked
[6:27:45] <etoir> what happened to your fervor gauge?
[6:27:46] <%luftraumm1> remember to crouch
[6:27:47] <%Crushter> it doesn't look different visually
[6:28:07] <%Crushter> but you've saved the penitent one's model as crouching, so you don't end up standing in an attack
[6:28:09] <%StaceMcGate> fervour is a bitch to gain naturally
[6:28:19] <+prism_zet> it like "hollowed" in dark souls?
[6:28:20] <%Crushter> fatalities give bonus
[6:28:34] <%Crushter> fuck he realized he could just cheese it
[6:28:37] <%Crushter> big coward energy
[6:28:53] <Fujiwara_92> spyCheese
[6:28:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Coward energy is strong
[6:29:00] <%Crushter> @prism_zet nah, more akin to curse, but if cursing weakened your magic/money gain
[6:29:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> holy shit, everyone watched pat get hit by the censor so many times? you people are amazing
[6:29:14] <+prism_zet> @Crushter gotcha, curse is balls
[6:29:16] <McAngrimStein> bonk
[6:29:17] <%Crushter> no
[6:29:21] <Ominnous> STOP
[6:29:23] <%Crushter> JUST CLIMB UP
[6:29:24] <%Dakuu75> right
[6:29:25] <worldbrand> me neither
[6:29:41] <%luftraumm1> blood platforms in big censer room though
[6:29:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes that

[6:29:53] <%Dakuu75> ladder went down

[6:31:50] <worldbrand> good question
[6:31:52] <%Crushter> if it can't find a place it does that
[6:31:52] <+ThunderZebraKing> everything is awful forever and you can't fix it.
[6:31:53] <McAngrimStein> your guilt was not ending her suffering
[6:31:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Pyroclase I mean below
[6:31:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if i'm not mistaken this is one of the bugs. Certain deaths will cause the guilt to be in a weird, inaccessible location.
[6:31:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat It's at the blud steps where the censer killed you
[6:31:59] <%NeroInfinite> T R E E MAN
[6:32:01] <%RubberFistFight> You may need to pay to get it back.
[6:32:11] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat look in albeo
[6:32:13] <%Crushter> for the symbol
[6:32:13] <TheDr0t> @AngriestPat she is suffering for your guilt
[6:32:29] <%Crushter> Yep
[6:32:29] <McAngrimStein> beating a boss also gets back your guilt doesn't it?
[6:32:30] <katocrimson> Our Lady of Perpetual Agony is a joke in F is for Family
[6:32:32] <%RubberFistFight> oh wow
[6:32:34] <%NeroInfinite> yep
[6:32:35] <%RubberFistFight> what's it doing all the way back there
[6:32:41] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat somtimes if it can't find a place, it default spawns it in Albeo for saftey
[6:32:44] <Funkyfjord> that just happens sometimes
[6:32:46] <Mendin> Sanity-checking for dying on a non-permanent pltaform?
[6:32:49] <Trash_leviathan> take the ladder you just got

[6:34:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat's great at games, right up until he panics. then it all hits the fan.
[6:34:10] <worldbrand> I think they care if you step on the books?
[6:34:11] <%Crushter> @Dakuu75 it's when you step on the books
[6:34:20] <bear_breaker20> @TheDr0t rioght
[6:34:23] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 they only get angry when careless little shits dog-ear the pages Kappa
[6:34:25] <McAngrimStein> time out
[6:34:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> if you're already at 4 mea culpa, it's hard getting more
[6:34:31] <%Crushter> sorrowful be the heart
[6:34:39] <%Dakuu75> ah-yes, stepping on books will cause nerds to agro
[6:34:52] <%KillerKaje> KillerKaje subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Use time stop

[6:35:18] <%d3na3> d3na3 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:35:57] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat go back up that wall climb before exploring the other hall way, and yes I did it legit
[6:36:04] <%Crushter> I have advice that makes it doable
[6:36:06] <%Dakuu75> what cheese? that looked legit
[6:36:19] <Fujiwara_92> spyCheese spyCheese spyCheese
[6:36:20] <%Crushter> but u can just use pelican to unga it
[6:36:27] <%Crushter> afaik, I never use pelican
[6:36:32] <%luftraumm1> did it legit too, but it's easier than it seems
[6:36:44] <%Laecerelius> Pat, Plague is at the race war negotiations part of Stormblood!
[6:36:53] <GiygasDrillBreak> why does everyone say Time Stop with Blasphemous? is Pelican what people say with Time Stop?
[6:37:04] <worldbrand> what just happened
[6:37:05] <%Crushter> what the hell
[6:37:10] <+ThunderZebraKing> Actually, since everything here is latin, wouldn't time stop be prohibere tempus ?
[6:37:23] <%StaceMcGate> Pat just walked through it
[6:37:25] <McAngrimStein> no it would still be za warudo
[6:37:51] <%Dakuu75> OOOOOOOOoooh, dude that's smart
[6:37:55] <worldbrand> oh
[6:37:56] <%RubberFistFight> @GiygasDrillBreak nah it's an in-joke. Back in the day the bestfriends got confused about what upgrade they needed and decided it was a timestop they were missing, and got gently mocked for it. So these days when Pat needs an upgrade everyone just calls it a Timestop.
[6:37:57] <%Crushter> part deux
[6:37:58] <+ahdurian> Pat can count to 9
[6:38:06] <%Crushter> No it isn't
[6:38:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> waaaaaat? i always did it when the censor left the right side
[6:38:10] <Mendin> It came from t he God of War LP
[6:38:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> that censor is still real, pat
[6:38:21] <%RubberFistFight> @GiygasDrillBreak it's basically code for "you need an upgrade here"
[6:38:26] <Jolnir> this game is just rayman
[6:38:46] <worldbrand> what's that blood?
[6:38:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> i never woulda figured that out, what Time Stop means
[6:38:50] <%Crushter> you have to stay on a blood platform
[6:38:51] <Mendin> So derived blood-sands have a timer

[6:49:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Coystick you should watch his Hollow Knight videos, they're fucking great. For the same reason. Bullies the shit out of bosses, dies to platforms.

[6:50:43] <%Crushter> great boss design

[6:50:47] <Coystick> If you oneshot this I'm gonna be mad
[6:50:48] <%Reaped_Psyche> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[6:50:48] <senfood> Look at this lazy, bitch ass skellington
[6:50:49] <+Pyroclase> those are some hairy arms
[6:51:01] <alexandrecau> the hairy arms are creepier
[6:51:03] <%Crushter> the uppercut is good for this
[6:51:05] <worldbrand> melquiades: yeah me and these guys are thiiiis tight *finger twist*
[6:51:05] <+prism_zet> hahaha
[6:51:08] <%Dakuu75> did you guys hear that? it sounded like "sploosh" coming from Paige's general direction
[6:51:10] <beetbo2> ITS SKELETON POPE
[6:51:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is she making the Naruto hand signs?
[6:51:17] <+prism_zet> why the hairy arms haha
[6:51:20] <%CopperTucker> Skelepope
[6:51:22] <All_Salt> That's real Neeto
[6:51:23] <alexandrecau> is the skeleton flipping you off
[6:51:26] <%RubberFistFight> bahahah the jaw wobbles
[6:51:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That skull crunch is a really satisfying hit sound
[6:51:28] <%Reaped_Psyche> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[6:51:28] <Coystick> Love the hand gestures
[6:51:32] <cureneckbeard> apatSkelmoney
[6:51:33] <%Crushter> ah yes, pat's realizing what I did that for the spin combo you have to wait for the third hit to land
[6:51:39] <Mendin> It's the next lead singer for Ghost
[6:51:39] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 I though the sound was "SPLARCH"
[6:51:46] <%zamzoph> I never thought of a crowdsurfing giant skeleton as a boss before
[6:51:51] <McAngrimStein> watch out for skelepope's indomitable ninpo
[6:52:02] <%Crushter> @zamzoph well that's a thing they did in the old days, dress up saint bones and walk em around
[6:52:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Skeletons. Paige's ninja way
[6:52:14] <+AtlasMcCoy> Puts on the buffed spell heart. No mana for spells.
[6:52:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> ooof
[6:52:17] <worldbrand> he's got a lot of health
[6:52:29] <%Crushter> he only gets hurt from the skull
[6:52:30] <McAngrimStein> he only takes health damage to the head
[6:52:31] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Almost!
[6:52:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> and thats why i dont like that heart, fervor is too hard to restore
[6:52:34] <Coystick> I can HEAR Paige fapping behind the couch
[6:52:47] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Paige pls go
[6:52:50] <%Crushter> he actually is fairly weak but getting big damage is hard
[6:52:51] <Neo_Kaiser> That boss is just going, "NYEH!" over and over again.
[6:53:02] <Mendin> Popeyrus III
[6:53:04] <%RubberFistFight> I'm going to assume that that's not blood coming out of the skeleton, but skeleton panic juice. Which is actually a thing they discovered the other day.
[6:53:06] <%Crushter> a nice touch is the lower the health the more hands you have to knock down
[6:53:07] <wookie5358> I come in to Pat fighting a skeleton while chat debaates what an aggressive orgasm sounds like.. Sounds about right.
[6:53:10] <worldbrand> those uppercuts hit for a lot
[6:53:10] <Coystick> Cluuuuuutch
[6:53:11] <McAngrimStein> cruising around at the speed of hairy arms
[6:53:15] <+BaronBattle> is there a word for this type of like...distorted music?
[6:53:18] <%superc37> so what's with the crossed fingers? I'm guessing that's a Catholic thing?
[6:53:21] <%Dakuu75> she's writing a SansXPapayrusXSekele-pope fan-fic as we speak
[6:53:27] <bear_breaker20> shoutouts to the lives lst to produce the massive drapes in the background
[6:53:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> the 3-hit combo is the real damage dealer, because the 3rd hit does 200% damage in a short enough time window
[6:53:28] <Coystick> The choir chaaaanting uuuuunf
[6:53:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Oh no
[6:53:34] <%Maids4lyfe> look at all that catholic guilt
[6:53:38] <%Crushter> @BaronBattle ambient horror?
[6:53:40] <+AtlasMcCoy> So close
[6:53:40] <%WhereIsWill> close
[6:53:42] <BakerBrute> @Dakuu75 You mean Pope-yrus?
[6:53:43] <SlimeSlimeSlime> So close
[6:53:43] <%RubberFistFight> BLORP
[6:53:43] <Fujiwara_92> bonk

[6:53:49] <%grayjammer> @BaronBattle A... dirge maybe?
[6:53:49] <+prism_zet> so clossse
[6:53:51] <Coystick> Damn that was an amazing attempt tho
[6:53:53] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah man
[6:53:53] <nobody12349> MORTIS
[6:53:57] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat to do the spin combo, you can only hold down after the third hit inputs
[6:53:58] <%RubberFistFight> @BakerBrute Pope-pyrus holy shit, that's awesome LUL
[6:54:00] <%Divryne> Good try though.
[6:54:00] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> hitting the bottem wasnt doing damage???
[6:54:16] <%Crushter> otherwise you'll do a crouch it
[6:54:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That Boss is so lazy he can't even be bothered to stand on his own to fight you
[6:54:23] <%Crushter> @DesuDesuDokiDoki no
[6:54:25] <LodiFrostbeard> @DesuDesuDokiDoki nope, only the head
[6:54:39] <McAngrimStein> if you had a dozen hairy arms always holding you up you'd be lazy too
[6:54:45] <Trash_leviathan> can you use the powah geyser to hit him while hes up ?
[6:54:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> oooh, but you need ta get rid of the hands, ok
[6:54:49] <%Crushter> He's being powered by faith
[6:54:56] <%Crushter> @Trash_leviathan yeah but pat hasn't switched yet
[6:54:59] <worldbrand> maybe leave the left arms for last because they're closest to the head?
[6:55:04] <%Crushter> the ground wave is also good for instagibbing arms
[6:55:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @McAngrimStein You have a point
[6:55:25] <%Crushter> pat seems averse to spellage tho
[6:55:27] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The Holy Skeleton. Paige's patron god
[6:55:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> 3 arms down is enough to drop him, if they're on 1 side, but later on all 5 need to be killed
[6:55:34] <%Andrizzleton> make sure the skull is unobstructed when you take out the last hand or else you miss your chance to hit
[6:55:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You can tell what she's gonna do depending on her fingers.
[6:55:50] <LodiFrostbeard> spells trivialize some of the bosses
[6:55:54] <LixFury> Wouldnt the power guiser be good for this?
[6:55:58] <alexandrecau> power geyser
[6:55:59] <%Crushter> more like makes them less of a monster
[6:56:10] <%Crushter> power geyser or power wave
[6:56:17] <+AtlasMcCoy> OH NO
[6:56:24] <cureneckbeard> NYEHEHEHE
[6:56:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That gosh darn staff!
[6:56:32] <LodiFrostbeard> geyser just shits on the final boss
[6:56:34] <%Crushter> protip, when you uppercut you can follow with the plunging
[6:56:43] <Coystick> Welcome to Bone Church population: Bones
[6:56:49] <McAngrimStein> so this is what would've happened if Skeletor ever beat He-Man
[6:56:52] <%Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard well yeah, but so does charge attacking next to his face if you do it right
[6:57:12] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, stop over committing.
[6:57:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Skeleton warriors
[6:57:17] <+BaronBattle> jesus christ this looks hard af
[6:57:18] <%Andrizzleton> Example atpGasm
[6:57:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you also have a projectile
[6:57:24] <%Divryne> Is there no dodge cancelling in this game?
[6:57:25] <%Maids4lyfe> do you pat?
[6:57:27] <Mendin> Papa Boneitis
[6:57:32] <%Crushter> @Divryne nope
[6:57:33] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat When did Papyrus become God?
[6:57:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> there isnt, nor is there combo cancel
[6:57:38] <%Crushter> dodges are big commit
[6:57:38] <%Divryne> Shit.
[6:57:50] <Coystick> Oh lord bless us with bones, big bones, so that we may bone.
[6:57:53] <+AtlasMcCoy> Good start
[6:57:56] <%Crushter> you can combo cancel but not if you perform an ender
[6:57:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Thumb to middle knuckle is lasers, fingers in a twisted peace sign is stabby
[6:57:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> really going for that <50% accuracy there
[6:58:02] <%reneries> you cant Parry the Staff?
[6:58:05] <McAngrimStein> this may be your biggest boner yet
[6:58:17] <%Crushter> @reneries it's an overhead, so no
[6:58:30] <%Divryne> So there's no attack cancelling in this game too?
[6:58:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Upon being asked if Papyrus wants anything, without hesitation he promptly uttered "penitence"
[6:58:32] <+AtlasMcCoy> F
[6:58:40] <Coystick> You know what they call an overhead? The Bone Zone.
[6:58:41] <%Crushter> the head isn't damageable if he's in air
[6:58:45] <deltakuma009> so is this on par with hollow knight?
[6:58:51] <%Maids4lyfe> It only works when he's down
[6:58:59] <%Crushter> @deltakuma009 hollow knight is much bigger of a game
[6:59:09] <Mendin> Hollow Knight is on a pedestal of its own but this game's pretty good
[6:59:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Good!
[6:59:22] <%RubberFistFight> @deltakuma009 hollow knight narrowly beats it on account of being much bigger and also a fucking masterpiece of a game, but this game's no slouch either.
[6:59:31] <Kalinflip> Big Pokee
[6:59:35] <%Crushter> upppercut into full air reka plus blood sonic boom is big damage
[6:59:42] <%Dakuu75> almost there... don't mess with the formula
[6:59:51] <Coystick> You gooooot this
[6:59:53] <+machinetoys> very hairy arms
[6:59:57] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat you forget your sonic booms a lot
