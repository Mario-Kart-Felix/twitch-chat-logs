[0:01:46] <+iamwood99> the only reason why i care about rage 2 is because they used a danny brown song in a trailer

[0:02:08] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> what is rage
[0:02:09] <Guardiansaiyan> @orangerainbow congrats
[0:02:12] <BigNerdSam> Yo, YTMND is dead.
[0:02:14] <yourliteraldog> Rage 1 was basically a tech demo ID tech 5
[0:02:14] <$happyface699> I only care about this game because of the power trip song
[0:02:15] <demegodz> Fallout
[0:02:19] <+absolute_cagemony> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[0:02:19] <%Promessa_EX> are we here to laugh at the bad game
[0:02:21] <%anAngryHamster> Rage is the closest a game can be to a shoulder shrug

[0:02:29] <%Solidus_113> what is this Twitch integration
[0:02:30] <CalderGaming> the first rage was a pretty generic story post-apocalyptic FPS with some crafting/RPG stuff, driving, and neat enemy behavior
[0:02:30] <+Mittensbro> the only thing i know about this game is that Andrew WK performed a song for this game and it was the lowest energy thing i'd ever seen in my life
[0:02:30] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> I would never spend another 60 on something Bethesda is associated with
[0:02:31] <+manasaurusrex03> I heard about the cube on the podcast, and I'm here to see it for myself
[0:02:38] <%BallinArbiter> apatPat

[0:02:56] <yourliteraldog> Rage had it's moments
[0:02:57] <+absolute_cagemony> I buy everything Bethesda puts out cause their games are awesome
[0:02:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@mayorrev) (warning)
[0:03:00] <Guardiansaiyan> @HentaiSenpai9K I have woolie's stream up and I don't see it

[0:03:09] <CalderGaming> which makes me wonder why rade 2 switched from idtech 5 to the just cause 4 engine
[0:03:12] <cherrycottontail> woolie backed down?

[0:44:32] <+DCross13> Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did

[0:49:57] <SilverFaustX> Typing on ps4 twitch sucks btw
[0:49:59] <%allouttajuice> @mechslayer71 question is, does it being self aware and "ironic" in being lame trash make it more palatable when it's intended to make fun of tropes
[0:50:01] <%nmaten> Erina peldleton
[0:50:05] <CalderGaming> it's winding up to kill him if he's too slow

[0:50:18] <%TrulyIncandescent> Yep, don't take this shit seriously LUL
[0:50:18] <+zaworldo> ok no
[0:50:19] <+Blackgaver> if you see this message i'm dead cliché
[0:50:20] <+zaworldo> OK NO
[0:50:20] <Smaenus> "You're the protagonist now"
[0:50:21] <californaya> that's some bad holographic trigger discipline

[0:50:22] <alexandrecau> likely dead but by this guy in particular
[0:50:22] <MarylandJutsu> YOU KNEW?!??!
[0:50:22] <+TheSaintJohn> I'm gonna hold my gun in the hologram message lol
[0:50:23] <dukenux> If the game will keep tone similar to Bulletstorm this might be okay

[0:50:28] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat that's a script on her belt
[0:50:30] <$happyface699> Is that the scipt

[0:50:46] <theotrainwreck> I can't believe she knew the whole time
[0:50:47] <InsomniacPersona> Is it just me or is it hard to read subtitles?
[0:50:48] <+mugwugsampoo> OMG is that the script in the sand?

[1:12:07] <%MightyMaxT> Those are some Bioshock ragdolls
[1:12:12] <meowmeow7t> this game would benefit from glory kills
[1:12:15] <+Saltima> that armor break with melee is interesting
[1:12:20] <%thebonebard> seems like punch is more of a stun than a kill move

[1:14:32] <%DSD24> Buster? got it
[1:14:34] <krymzen5> the combat looks fun, kinda feels like a time waster till doom 2 tho
[1:14:36] <%Ascethetic> FUS ROH DAH
[1:14:37] <lovesosa236> so is this game good cause I dont see people saying it's bad or amazing
[1:14:38] <EuropantLamprey> Nudifier jump kick?
[1:14:40] <%deviljhojho94> closer
[1:14:40] <+zaworldo> BEST ABILITY
[1:14:42] <%ThirdWelles> Hold LB and press X
[1:14:43] <KilljoyHexx> VR troopers was underrated
[1:14:44] <%spiritofmojave> So the training in this is basically just MGR
[1:14:45] <TheHoodKnight> Bang bang bang
[1:14:46] <$SereneFox> So Pat's lunging into people and stealing their clothes, when did we start playing Akiba's Trip?
[1:14:48] <bonzosan> you're a worlock now
[1:14:49] <dukenux> Force push
[1:14:50] <CalderGaming> fire the writers pls
[1:14:50] <$PaleBloodInk> Within a certain range.
[1:14:51] <%ElenaManetta> That looks like a lunge
[1:14:52] <reinbachthe3rd> FUS RO DAH!
[1:14:52] <@Mechz71> oh how flaccid
[1:14:54] <thelonechris> Strip the target
[1:14:55] <%depressed_skeleton> it kinda launches you at them
[1:14:55] <RupanSen> it's a mini-lunge
[1:14:55] <%benjiFG> strip
[1:14:56] <Ragnakawaii> Awesome range on that lunge
[1:14:57] <AsterBodhran> don't you mean BIG melee
[1:14:58] <+gantz_zero> take their clothes off
[1:14:58] <+TeraMercier> Why is it called shatter?
[1:14:59] <%ElenaManetta> I think they meant LUNGE the enemy
[1:14:59] <%around_40_jobbers> level 1 range LUL
[1:15:00] <$cureneckbeard> fus ro da!
[1:15:01] <@lewdskeletor13> I wouldn’t say it’s a bad game, but it’s certainly not gonna win any awards
[1:15:01] <%ElenaManetta> I don't know man
[1:15:02] <CalderGaming> more like a strike
[1:15:04] <%CJett92> That sounds like a doujin plot

[1:15:19] <CalderGaming> underwhelming
[1:15:21] <%crimsonharvest> reminds me of Crysis melee
[1:15:21] <%TombstoneTTromboners> this seems like a fun game to get on sale in a month

[1:15:29] <+Nomicro4u> Go find more holes to stick ur arm in
[1:15:33] <%NovaKnightmare> feels like a weaker unrelenting force
[1:15:33] <+Estuko> @CJett92 "the women are being attacked by clothes, and I'm the only one who can tear them off."
[1:15:35] <%spiritofmojave> Push doesn't hold anything on glory-kills
[1:15:36] <%MelBrooksKA> Time to go back to the car that wants to fuck us

[1:16:28] <$RaikenTB> Clothes go flying off Kreygasm
[1:16:37] <%dopeboy_i> I'm here to support you Pat.
[1:16:40] <+Nomicro4u> The gib sounds in this are extra wet
[1:16:42] <CalderGaming> what's the point of shatter when regular melee does that to armor anyway in the early game
[1:16:43] <%ThirdWelles> They're boomerangs. They're not for melee range, you fool
[1:16:44] <@lewdskeletor13> All these people had families. You’re orphaning so many kids
[1:16:44] <dukenux> wow

[1:16:44] <%spiritofmojave> I want to take their clothes, OFF
[1:16:48] <%Taisuru> This game looks like Doo9m but instead of interesting enemy variety they have dudes with guns
[1:16:48] <TheHoodKnight> This games marketing was poop but boy does it look fun

[1:17:01] <%Wintermute_VRC> Is there anything about this game that sets it apart from all the other first person shooters that have ever been made?
[1:17:01] <%DSD24> That looks dope
[1:17:02] <%depressed_skeleton> stick with mad max
[1:17:02] <CurrySauseBandit> @CalderGaming It's more for Nightmare difficulty.

[1:17:14] <@lewdskeletor13> I like the look of that one
[1:17:15] <+Nomicro4u> Mad Max the game where you shove maggots into your face to gain health
[1:17:16] <thelonechris> So like Just Cause?
[1:17:17] <@commanderclaw> They made Just Cause 4 too, but that was bad
[1:17:18] <%deviljhojho94> Mad max was underrated
[1:17:20] <%Dualparadoxes> GET IN DA ROLLA, 'UMIE!

[1:24:07] <%depressed_skeleton> Summon the monster truck
[1:24:08] <$RaikenTB> I'm glad Pat doesn't have a license.
[1:24:09] <+Saltima> is there's some sort of fetish for these mannequins?
[1:24:10] <%ElenaManetta> As if explosions are normally thought about as small
[1:24:12] <$Totally_not_toby> this game is so quirky haha funni mannequins
[1:24:20] <Videogamer4> wow this game world looks bland as hell

[1:24:37] <razdoop> Welcome to Rage Cage, filled with boring menus and a tech game for a better game, oh yeahh
[1:24:38] <%depressed_skeleton> its at least funny bad
[1:24:39] <Dr_Mooose> OCD pleaser
[1:24:40] <rytisone> OCD kicked in
[1:24:40] <%deviljhojho94> monkaS
[1:24:40] <CurrySauseBandit> This game is a fine streaming game
[1:24:40] <televisedrevolting> You know what? I feel you.
[1:24:40] <RupanSen> sounds riveting
[1:24:40] <Psyramics> it fills the spot in your life that Skyrim would have?
[1:24:41] <%blastazoid26> so no skyrim?
[1:24:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> story's awful, huh?
[1:24:44] <BunnyEmperor> Then play it Pat, you shouldnt care what we think
[1:24:44] <%ElenaManetta> Why not just play Borderlands with your "friends"
[1:24:47] <%Cavumentum> Dumb bad or stupid bad?
[1:24:48] <pmtriox> but the story seems like it wants to get in your way constantly
[1:24:50] <+d00msdaydan> @ElenaManetta number go up but not in a shlooter way
[1:24:50] <%Comradeiota> Rage 1 made me feel nothing. Does this at least bring about an emotion?
[1:24:50] <aimlesshealer> Todd is waiting for you my friend
[1:24:50] <AmericanaRed> borderlands 3?
[1:24:51] <$RaikenTB> FailFish

[1:24:56] <%deviljhojho94> tomatoDisgust

[1:24:57] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i wanna play it
[1:24:59] <%spiritofmojave> Wet meat
[1:25:01] <razdoop> Squishes
[1:25:01] <CrypticMochi> How much crap can you run over?
[1:25:01] <dekkitout> A decent game ensconced in good and bad games
[1:25:05] <mayorrev> better than skyrim Kappa
[1:25:05] <%ThirdWelles> So 70% of the entire game is gonna be played off-stream? Got it. Understood.
[1:25:06] <mrgrimsmiles> the sounds of running over cactus
[1:25:07] <%depressed_skeleton> Can we see the monster truck pat?
[1:25:07] <%Ahack13> Did anyone expect the story to be good? I thought it was dumb for dumb shooty sake.
[1:25:10] <Kokoro_Breaker> i mean days gone is the same thing but better BUUUUUT whatever
[1:25:11] <MadMatt2099> "It's like skyrim but with guns"
[1:25:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat, the Angriest Rooster Tooth.
[1:25:12] <%Finakala> Probably plays better than Skyrim, although most games do
[1:25:15] <mrgrimsmiles> sound pretty gross and funny
[1:25:17] <thelonechris> Look at this Red Dead Redemption area
[1:25:17] <%deviljhojho94> i like the pink
[1:25:19] <%topendbuzz> sure does not look like it does
[1:25:20] <%around_40_jobbers> it IS pretty
[1:25:20] <+yoshkosh20> cool neon cars beat out mountain climbing horses any day.
[1:25:27] <CalderGaming> no splat SFX smdh
[1:25:33] <%Nomad_Scholar> not driving the waifu car?
[1:25:33] <%ThirdWelles> Is that Sam Riegel?
[1:25:33] <%Kravedarknesss> avalanche studios made that mad max game so i would hope the driving was as good as that
[1:25:34] <Smart_ZaK1> Gunrim
[1:25:36] <Prism_Wing> Run around and shoot goo. Exactly what Psycho Mantis was all about Kappa
[1:25:43] <%ThirdWelles> That's Sam fuckin Riegel
[1:25:43] <%DSD24> @ThirdWelles Pretty sure it is
[1:25:43] <televisedrevolting> @thirdwelles You betcha.
[1:25:44] <+yoshkosh20> @ThirdWelles lol yep
[1:25:44] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah yeah the gameplay is fine, but we all know what the most important part in a video game is: HOW IS THE STORY
[1:25:46] <Videogamer4> this voice actor sounds familiar but I can't name him???
[1:25:47] <Cymen90> OMFG

[1:39:38] <MarylandJutsu> Everyone here for ELMMMMMOOOO
[1:39:40] <%ElenaManetta> I really read that as "Gay Jump"
[1:39:40] <%PanicSwytch> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[1:39:42] <+TamaskaLem> This game just need some anime titties and it'll be great
[1:39:45] <Ion_Laser> When's Rocket Jump?
[1:39:46] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Sorry @AngriestPat My phone must be screwed up
[1:39:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> now we jumpin
[1:39:49] <%Laecerelius> You too can Super Jump like Excalibur!
[1:39:49] <worldbrand> Oh, he was talking about another stream.
[1:39:52] <dekkitout> Big jumps, AND dashes
[1:39:55] <+gantz_zero> double bitch-hop
[1:39:55] <%polyseif> its the doom double jumo
[1:39:55] <%benjiFG> do a fart
[1:39:58] <%TombstoneTTromboners> DOUBLE JUMP
[1:39:58] <Psyramics> RAGE 1 was mid
[1:39:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[1:40:00] <+krawtch> wow never seen that in doom 2016
[1:40:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Jump into the z fighting
[1:40:03] <%Strider222> bye
[1:40:04] <%ThirdWelles> I'm gonna buy this game at some point
[1:40:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> now THIS is podracing.
[1:40:06] <%crimsonharvest> So its good is what youre saying
[1:40:06] <Nina96> fart jump
[1:40:06] <%around_40_jobbers> deep down I hope that the jump height increases exponentially
[1:40:06] <Futurecity10> Its fucking nothing like doom
[1:40:06] <JamvaanPS4> More than 500 people would show up to watch Elmo lick his own hair
[1:40:07] <%depressed_skeleton> bye ai lady
[1:40:07] <Djinnazz> Budget Dom
[1:40:08] <NickHatesSnow> Well duh
[1:40:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ....
[1:40:09] <demegodz> Just Doom, the Game
[1:40:09] <pmtriox> doom didn't need a training box
[1:40:09] <+burritocheetos> doom with CARS
[1:40:10] <$GoogleyGareth> I'm good with that
[1:40:10] <redsynod> Just far cry doom
[1:40:11] <+TamaskaLem> @TheOneCalledRock I see. Can't argue that since no one I know played it
[1:40:11] <MarylandJutsu> PRESS X TO DOOM
[1:40:12] <%ThirdWelles> I like goofy free roam doom
[1:40:12] <%TombstoneTTromboners> doom 2016 clone
[1:40:12] <+Mittensbro> so we took doom and threw it into far cry do you like it
[1:40:13] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Doom is way more fun tho
[1:40:13] <%ElenaManetta> This game has WEIRD naming conventions. Health pack is Health INFUSION. Double jump is GRAV JUMP
[1:40:14] <%polyseif> does it even make the same sound
[1:40:14] <rytisone> *E1M1 intensifies*
[1:40:16] <$Brother_Coduss> OPEN WORLD DOOM
[1:40:16] <$cureneckbeard> Doom (2016)
[1:40:17] <$bootysteve> This is doom by way of anthony burch
[1:40:19] <+Robopengy> But isn't it like....whacky doom?
[1:40:19] <DevilDeus13> @ElenaManetta Only hetero jumps allowed
[1:40:19] <Smart_ZaK1> Why would double jump be a powerup?
[1:40:20] <ThatGuyThere03> get big excite for DOOM
[1:40:21] <Futurecity10> this is a shitty doom bastard
[1:40:22] <Vakojin> Doom with Funky mode.
[1:40:23] <+krawtch> this is all just DOOM shit
[1:40:23] <lloyddboy> DUUM
[1:40:24] <PROUD2beGINGER> It's every game in one.
[1:40:24] <+unfamous2423> Just Doom is really good
[1:40:26] <%ElenaManetta> What about shonen jumps
[1:40:26] <Prism_Wing> Twitch shows an inaccurate viewer count before you enter a stream. Usually much lower.
[1:40:27] <CalderGaming> replicating doom 2016 in just cause 4.... congrats i guess
[1:40:27] <%crimsonharvest> actually that hand animation is very doom
[1:40:30] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat Can we see the monster truck?
[1:40:30] <+Saltima> were those visual glitches supposed to happeN?
[1:40:30] <%jiin6> doom with Vroom vrooms, and no glory kils
[1:40:32] <$bootysteve> Doom? more like dumb
[1:40:33] <%MightyMaxT> But is it a GOOD Doom?

[1:40:47] <$bootysteve> This is Anthony Burch Doom
[1:40:47] <$monkeyhous3> It's just like Doom, only not as good
[1:40:49] <+krawtch> fisting technology ports. seeing your hands. double jumping on cubes.
[1:40:49] <nobody12349> DOOM but Bad
[1:40:50] <Ion_Laser> DooM more like MeH
[1:40:54] <Xiangchang> Was that a SOMA hole?
[1:40:56] <demegodz> Where's the kill pat button

[1:41:53] <CalderGaming> @tyrano_the_wise because mad max
[1:41:58] <$GoogleyGareth> I feel like this game would have benefited from stealing Doom's health system as well
[1:42:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I did the pikachus how are all of you?
[1:42:08] <$HentaiSenpai9K> The problem with this game is that it has no unique mechanic
[1:42:09] <Fien111> This looks.....extremely dull
[1:42:11] <rytisone> cover is for pussies
[1:42:23] <@lewdskeletor13> @anceldelambert How was the Pikachus
[1:42:23] <CeeDee__> wait this is hard mode?
[1:42:24] <+TheOneCalledRock> THIS IS HARD MODE?

[1:42:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @lewdskeletor13 it was pretty meh
[1:42:32] <%Comradeiota> Seriously?
[1:42:32] <Smart_ZaK1> All of these enemies are generic as fuck
[1:42:33] <Nina96> this is hard mode?
[1:42:33] <CareBear420> play on nightmare pussy
[1:42:34] <CurrySauseBandit> Nightmare mode is a lot better.
[1:42:34] <+Bad1uck> Modern game easy mode
[1:42:35] <%ElenaManetta> Play the whole game to unlock SUPER HARD MODE
[1:42:36] <ninjaguiden> wat
[1:42:37] <%Harawanagangsta> The enemies dont really fight back
[1:42:37] <%ElenaManetta> or whatever i bet
[1:42:38] <razdoop> Memes aside, It looks Fun like 2009 or 2010 Fun shooter
[1:42:39] <Maids4lyfe> if this is hard mode, what would easy mode be like?
[1:42:40] <rytisone> Gman said to play on hard
[1:42:42] <tyrano_the_wise> borderlands meets doom but lame?
[1:42:42] <ToneBacas> European extreme or bust

[1:42:51] <%VioletHeart> There's a harder mode.
[1:42:52] <%Bt_Robot> Motorcycle!
[1:42:53] <gatoralus> yeah this looks very much like an open world game with doom shooting plus super abilities. im down
[1:42:53] <%Laecerelius> Pat you're missing a chest
[1:42:53] <Flame_Water> Isn't this the same game where you get extra points for doing trick kills?
[1:42:54] <DrkJP520> It's like DOOM on Ultra Violence
[1:42:55] <%PanicSwytch> I THOUGHT IT WAS EZ
[1:42:55] <xBolts4Lifex> This IS hard mode for game journalists LUL

[1:43:08] <mayorrev> There's easy, normal, hard and nightmare
[1:43:10] <CalderGaming> what is that grinding noise

[1:45:49] <%MagickBurritoh> This videogame is such a videogame
[1:45:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> i feel like if this game embraced it's DOOM qualities more instead of kinda just having it on the side it would be more fun
[1:45:50] <callsigneagle01> or is it too early to tell?
[1:45:51] <+Bad1uck> It's points ALL the way down

[1:46:34] <+battlebeast67> jmcroftsGotem hey chat
[1:46:35] <+krawtch> this is some 2019 lip sync
[1:46:35] <DXLelouch24> this mobile game im playing is more fun than this trash,Honkai Impact 3rd
[1:46:35] <%AncelDeLambert> So this feels like Borderlands is this like Borderlands?
[1:46:35] <MoulesFritz> who's this main character VA
[1:46:36] <ninjaguiden> is the Judge Dredd?
[1:46:37] <ninjaguiden> Muties
[1:46:39] <%benjiFG> robo-bepis
[1:46:39] <callsigneagle01> @lewdskeletor13 well that's good. I guess the better question is will people care about this by Summer?
[1:46:40] <MoulesFritz> I swear I know him
[1:46:43] <energywarning> why not just a robo-leg?
[1:46:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> is that ProZD?
[1:46:47] <%thebonebard> whats the voice actor of the protagonist again
[1:46:47] <CalderGaming> @MoulesFritz sam riegel
[1:46:48] <+krawtch> AAA facial animation
[1:46:49] <+king_egret_sly> Sam Riegel, if you watch critical role you know him
[1:46:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @callsigneagle01 Probably not
[1:46:52] <%unclekulikov> unclekulikov subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak!

[1:47:05] <energywarning> that fucker is DOUBLE PARKED
[1:47:06] <pmtriox> why does every line seem like it's 12 words too long?
[1:47:07] <$cureneckbeard> Why do they sell a food that makes you barf
[1:47:08] <theotrainwreck> how random and funny
[1:47:10] <callsigneagle01> this game looks so much like Mad Max
[1:47:12] <%ElenaManetta> YOu mean you can't GRAV-JUMP.
[1:47:13] <mechslayer71> How did they go from Loosum Dare Kreygasm to THIS DansGame
[1:47:13] <dabirSA> so this is borderlands with less of a sense of humour?
[1:47:14] <Smart_ZaK1> Was that supposed to be . . .humor?
[1:47:15] <%ElenaManetta> Say it correctly, Pat
[1:47:16] <%Sovspot> what is pats impressions thus far
[1:47:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> liam o'brien or whatever?
[1:47:19] <razdoop> Loooook the game did the funnis hahaha epic gamer moment
[1:47:23] <nobody12349> This game is 2000 and late
[1:47:24] <tyrano_the_wise> i cant be the only one that forgot this game even existed
[1:47:28] <BIGGERLukas> Is this game playable with a lightgun like the first one was?
[1:47:31] <$GoogleyGareth> Everyone always skips out on facial animations. Half life 2 still do them better than most, and that's like 15 years old
[1:47:31] <rytisone> TITANFALL
[1:47:32] <%TombstoneTTromboners> there shouldn't be parking in the apocalypse
[1:47:33] <$shurtal> Goddamnit, for some reason this game just makes me want Cyberpunk so much more. this game has nothing to do with Cyberpunk... fuck i want that game
[1:47:33] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s a Liam O’Brien sound-alike
[1:47:36] <mayorrev> mario kart
[1:47:39] <%ElenaManetta> Rage 2: Double Dash
[1:47:40] <DXLelouch24> this game doesnt have Musclegirls so Borderlands 3 wins by default
[1:47:43] <+PigGuy800> double dare
[1:47:43] <starotter70> Yeah, Bazinga, am I right guys?
[1:47:50] <+maybefalco> @BIGGERLukas the first game had lightgun support tf?
[1:47:54] <OkamiDude15> how is the raw jae deux?
[1:47:57] <ninjaguiden> *canned laughter*
[1:47:58] <energywarning> oh, you're a lady
[1:47:58] <%ElenaManetta> Beat up Riddler nerds for information
[1:48:01] <BIGGERLukas> Breaking Bad never lied to me
[1:48:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> god, I hate the character designs
[1:48:01] <%Dementedpenguin> @tyrano_the_wise I can do you one better; I forgot the Far Cry game came out this year.
[1:48:01] <%CJett92> Why that girl got an iPad?
[1:48:03] <starotter70> Oh my
[1:48:06] <Nina96> information = side quest
[1:48:07] <%sjay449> @lewdskeletor13 It's Sam Reigel
[1:48:07] <%Conyst> don't forget dine and dash
[1:48:08] <razdoop> Ooof Lady
[1:48:09] <demegodz> Why do all these fuckers have baby faces
[1:48:10] <Ion_Laser> What is wrong with your faaace?
[1:48:11] <Fien111> oh that mouth flaps
[1:48:12] <+krawtch> welcome to the post apocalypse, where we all have mohawks
[1:48:12] <MoulesFritz> Oooohhhhh the main character is Phoenix Wright
[1:48:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> they're so forgettable
[1:48:14] <$GoogleyGareth> WHERE'S YOUR TOP TEETH?!
[1:48:15] <MoulesFritz> that's why
[1:48:16] <%unclekulikov> this mouth animation
[1:48:17] <%thebonebard> she looks like kermit the frog
[1:48:18] <tyrano_the_wise> theres a new far cry? wtf
[1:48:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> PATROLLING THE MOJAVE ALMOST MAKES YOU WlSH FOR A NUCLEAR WlNTER
[1:48:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> @tyrano_the_wise i didn't even know it came out today until i saw it one the front page of steam and went "oh...."
[1:48:24] <mechslayer71> Loosum Dare to this DansGame
[1:48:26] <%ElenaManetta> This lady needs a nose job
[1:48:29] <%unclekulikov> I'm getting New Vegas vibes
[1:48:30] <DevilDeus13> You can tell its the apocalypse because mohawks
[1:48:32] <%ElenaManetta> She needs a Seinfeld nose job
[1:48:33] <Xiangchang> She's had too much Rage-Juice.
[1:48:33] <Smart_ZaK1> This game is pretty dated, and it just came out
[1:48:34] <Coystick> WHY DOES IT LOOK WORSE THAN Rage 2011?
[1:48:34] <+SaltySombrero> muties?!
[1:48:36] <DrkJP520> Don't stand so close to them, geez!
[1:48:38] <CalderGaming> weren't the NPC faces in rage 1 like super high res? i swear i remember this old wrinkly guy
[1:48:41] <%crimsonharvest> why is everyone such a bitch
[1:48:41] <%hussdogrob> this is a dust covered beaut huh?
[1:48:41] <callsigneagle01> @ThatGuyfromMars M E R E L Y P R E T E N D I N G
[1:48:42] <+krawtch> for real tho, mohawks dont need hair physics so give them to literally 80% of NPCs
[1:48:45] <CrypticMochi> You look like a dirty mannequin, lady
[1:48:49] <Videogamer4> this game has some forgettable looking npcs
[1:48:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> why are there so many freaking mohawks
[1:48:54] <tank7013> This is just Kronika but with hair. Look at that baby face
[1:48:56] <KangarooCyborg> There's something extremely lame about a mohawk in a post apocalyptic setting.
[1:49:03] <%LymanAl> Pierce Fierce
[1:49:04] <Cymen90> @tyrano_the_wise Yeah and it takes place in the post apocalypse of the last one
[1:49:05] <%ElenaManetta> HEY PAT! Go to the area where the enemy difficulty is really high and see if the game is still easy
[1:49:06] <VJdarkworld> does Rage 2 have MEGA TEXTURES or whatever the gimmick was
[1:49:07] <%rosemon5001> silly pat your allready crazy
[1:49:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> this game is trying so god damn hard to be punk
[1:49:13] <dekkitout> Just Tony seems like a stand up guy
[1:49:15] <%CJett92> Just Tony as in Fair Tony or Only Tony?
[1:49:17] <razdoop> Zam Wilko, Dan Hagar, Walker Walker and Prowley, rage names are something
[1:49:18] <pmtriox> Just Tony is my favorite character now.
[1:49:19] <Smart_ZaK1> In the post-apocolypse everyone gets a free mohawk
[1:49:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man this game isn't nearly as colorful as the trailers were
[1:49:19] <callsigneagle01> @crimsonharvest I'm not sure why shit situations always makes people so pissy in media
[1:49:32] <mayorrev> Vinesauce?
[1:49:34] <Videogamer4> she sounds familiar
[1:49:34] <OkamiDude15> is this a sponsored stream?
[1:49:34] <Coystick> Just Tony killed my son
[1:49:36] <+Bad1uck> @theonecalledrock When the apocalypse happens everyone spontaneously sprouts a Mohawk
[1:49:37] <Fien111> VA director didn't even try
[1:49:39] <%Dementedpenguin> I can't believe they succeeded in making pink look so.... generic.
[1:49:41] <outis94> futaba
[1:49:41] <+TamaskaLem> I recognize her voice...
[1:49:43] <demegodz> but he's Just Tony
[1:49:45] <@commanderclaw> Upgrade even more shit
[1:49:48] <CurrySauseBandit> May want the health infusion schematic.
[1:49:50] <callsigneagle01> Like the best are the characters in a bad situation and can still be hopeful
[1:49:53] <KaseKaizer> schematics
[1:49:54] <Nina96> idk
[1:49:55] <DracaenaLeaf> that's a clear voice for a mouth cover
[1:49:55] <%ElenaManetta> Nano Booster
[1:49:56] <Psyramics> schematics
[1:49:58] <callsigneagle01> Stuff like that just makes me wanna shoot everyone
[1:50:04] <+krawtch> this game is like if you told an AI what punk was and showed it post-apocalyptic themes and then let it make a game
[1:50:06] <nobody12349> You should get out a better game
[1:50:07] <Pomer> what's the take on the game so far, chat?
[1:50:07] <+Blackgaver> BOOM BOOM BOOM

[1:50:27] <+Blackgaver> you need more turret drones LUL
[1:50:28] <%ArcanumMBD> So is this game really just Skyrim with guns?

[1:50:30] <gkingsausagelink> it's almost hard to watch

[1:50:43] <PROUD2beGINGER> Then I took an arrow to the knee
[1:50:44] <%PanicSwytch> Side quest
[1:50:47] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat rage has literally every mechanic that has been popular in the last 4 years, done less good
[1:50:48] <%ElenaManetta> Why did this game not get advertised I wonder
[1:50:49] <@commanderclaw> What a lovely gumbo of a game
[1:50:49] <Smart_ZaK1> This is the most videogame thing ever

[1:51:00] <+krawtch> is Pat required to like this game since its made by Bethesda, subsidiary of Zenimax Media who also have a large hold over Rooster Teeth
[1:51:04] <CrypticMochi> Let’s shove more video game grinding all in the beginning of the game
[1:51:04] <Nina96> @tyrano_the_wise they prefer mining
[1:51:06] <+Vex831> what even is this game?

[2:00:50] <CalderGaming> Everyone In This Game Please Stop Talking
[2:00:55] <BIGGERLukas> Looks pretty good though
[2:00:58] <tyrano_the_wise> this looks like garbage
[2:00:58] <%Kravedarknesss> @Nina96 it was actually co-developed between avalance and ID
[2:01:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't anyone in this world talk normal
[2:01:01] <person181> are we still on menu fixing?
[2:01:03] <+Champine> Allllll the tabs glowing

[2:01:10] <+Blackgaver> @AngriestPat don,t worry they'll fix it in like 2 weeks.............
[2:01:21] <tyrano_the_wise> fallout died for this
[2:01:30] <redsynod> good
[2:01:33] <+kawachipto> @benjiFG this is nothing like cyberpunk lol
[2:01:34] <benmpower236> I can't tell. Is the verdict on this game a good or is it a bad?
[2:01:34] <DevilDeus13> The atmosphere of this planet is 78% drugs

[2:02:06] <Sloavon> my pc has been melting since the stream started. what I miss y'all?
[2:02:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> besides NEON PINK
[2:02:10] <+krawtch> after 7 updates and 2 fan-made optimization patches, we are all going to look really stupid for saying this game doesn't look so great
[2:02:13] <+Champine> hold the door
[2:02:13] <%logoth_> This game looks like they were making rage 2, saw how bad it looked and just slapped a neon overlay over it
[2:02:19] <+mmSoTasty> but is it less bland than the original?
[2:02:20] <CalderGaming> @benmpower236 what we've seen so far has ranged from okay action to terrible terrible writing and clunky menus. reviews indicate that it gets better after another half hour or so
[2:02:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kill DnD they ruined GoT
[2:02:21] <%crimsonharvest> its like asking the graybears for a word location
[2:02:21] <benmpower236> @nina96 Well, could be worse I guess.
[2:02:23] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, intel is the replacement for towers
[2:02:25] <Psyramics> Digg and Dugg. I understand that reference
[2:02:31] <+Blackgaver> all in all the game is very well lit
[2:02:34] <+Blackgaver> i like it
[2:02:34] <%Black_Machete> apatGib
[2:02:35] <callsigneagle01> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli the truth is that GoT was never good

[2:03:03] <+Bad1uck> take that pink into the stink
[2:03:04] <%PanicSwytch> Pink means progress

[2:06:47] <Smart_ZaK1> Can one gun save this horrible game? Maybe
[2:06:52] <EASrake> LUL that dive
[2:06:56] <%SergeEXE> This is just the Doom engine
[2:06:56] <%ElenaManetta> Are the muties and Goon Squad two different things
[2:06:56] <%deviljhojho94> Those guys got fucked
[2:06:57] <Nina96> just like my ex
[2:06:58] <mikesapartment> This game came out?

[2:07:09] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Animations were the first game's WHOLE deal
[2:07:12] <ScreamingMeat> I remember the enemies had really good animation in the first game too
[2:07:13] <+Cadwae> @AngriestPat the animation engine was the draw of the first game, along with mega texture
[2:07:14] <edwizzle43> It’s not at 60
[2:07:18] <%GarbageNirvana> This game seems adequate
[2:07:20] <+TheSaintJohn> LUL

[2:07:37] <%logoth_> I would have bought this game for like 30
[2:07:39] <$Mendin> I respect a gun with potent knockback, especially if it has good damage
[2:07:44] <%around_40_jobbers> its never been more doom
[2:07:48] <Saterion> New Far Cry 3???
[2:07:52] <+tasenhall> watching this game on a controller is painful dude
[2:07:54] <EASrake> yeah pick up those bits

[2:09:03] <+Bad1uck> @chemtrailsgaming well it came out in 2011 and it took this long for a sequel so..... no
[2:09:03] <+chemtrailsgaming> UPGRADE SPOILERS
[2:09:04] <%unclekulikov> USE THOSE CONSUMABLES
[2:09:04] <Smart_ZaK1> Press A?
[2:09:04] <DrkJP520> Craft the BFG
[2:09:04] <shackbox> hold it
[2:09:04] <tank7013> Right side of the screen?
[2:09:04] <Saltmeisterr> rip
[2:09:05] <$Mendin> Armor Breaker Shot, Far Shot, Rapid Fire,
[2:09:05] <%Typhaeon> That's a red flag
[2:09:05] <@commanderclaw> You'd have to spend the bafmodads
[2:09:05] <henshin2289> i love how all the shotgun animations are just ripped from halo lol
[2:09:05] <Cymen90> :)
[2:09:06] <dekkitout> Gib upgradz
[2:09:06] <Psyramics> DO IT
[2:09:06] <+WillowMelody> Why don't you just unlock it, you're obviously going to max it out.
[2:09:06] <%SergeEXE> IT WAS THERETEXT
[2:09:06] <%Comradeiota> low opacity
[2:09:08] <+MechaBaphomet> This gun breaks the game
[2:09:08] <%Laecerelius> I see an armor breaker shot
[2:09:08] <+maybefalco> do it
[2:09:08] <shackbox> it's on the right
[2:09:09] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat It looks like the Halo Shotgun from the side
[2:09:09] <%jiin6> Unlock the level
[2:09:09] <%laundrysauce2> DO IT COWARD
[2:09:10] <Nina96> just upgrade
[2:09:10] <%crimsonharvest> why would you not unlock it
[2:09:11] <%ElenaManetta> Google it lol
[2:09:12] <+zaworldo> YOU HAVE TO COMMIT
[2:09:14] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Maids4lyfe) (warning)
[2:09:16] <jman13131313> you see it
[2:09:17] <EASrake> They're on the right side
[2:09:18] <KangarooCyborg> Each upgrade should be duct taping additional shotguns to the shotgun
[2:09:18] <%Laecerelius> far shot, rapid fire
[2:09:23] <%Typhaeon> I'm one of those people who would upgrade the pistol
[2:09:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but the numbers go down
[2:09:34] <%SergeEXE> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:09:35] <redsynod> Kill those goblins Pat
[2:09:41] <Maids4lyfe> choose one
[2:09:43] <+gantz_zero> seems you can swap between the two
[2:09:45] <Nina96> i think u pick 1
[2:09:46] <+ChaosVulpes> I think you spend weapon core mods to unlock the thing
[2:09:46] <CurrySauseBandit> Choose 1, you get options to switch them a bit later.
[2:09:46] <mrgrimsmiles> you still need keys for it
[2:09:47] <+Cadwae> @AngriestPat The Feltrite unlocks not only unlock custom things like those perks, but also passive upgrades

[2:09:51] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat loaders better
[2:09:52] <%Comradeiota> that is a Doom, for sure
[2:10:00] <%Mr_Rakjo> @AngriestPat one per unlock but you need weapon cores , there is a perk that lets you switch them around tho
[2:10:01] <%Laecerelius> So same upgrades. reload gooder or more boom per reload
[2:10:03] <+krawtch> he was just doing parkour and you shot him
[2:10:04] <QaizerArt> So how tis this so far?
[2:10:05] <ScreamingMeat> Reload faster or reload less often?
[2:10:11] <Onamar> This game looks... not great
[2:10:13] <Prism_Wing> snaaake?
[2:10:17] <tyrano_the_wise> fat roll
[2:10:18] <Nina96> r these just imps? @AngriestPat
[2:10:19] <+krawtch> do enemies attack you in this game
[2:10:28] <+Blackgaver> monsters and underwears.... sick
[2:10:29] <%Svanyr> God they almost sound like Billy/imps from WoW
[2:10:30] <%jiin6> apatGib you gon die
[2:10:32] <Cymen90> @Onamar But he says he loves it for some reason
[2:10:33] <+zaworldo> p a t you have to actually....pick one?
[2:10:36] <@commanderclaw> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:10:36] <a_mad_dragon> you can knock them into each other
[2:10:37] <%Laecerelius> You really have to get balls deep into those crates to hit them
[2:10:39] <Psyramics> I like the really clear 'Ded' indicator
[2:10:42] <SuperFineButtHairs> this game is pretty
[2:10:42] <Wauughlord> @ScreamingMeat Faster, always. Doesn't everyone panic reload always?
[2:10:44] <+Bad1uck> @krawtch no they just want hugs
[2:10:44] <%Typhaeon> FPSes never look good with controller camera
[2:10:46] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat What do you SEE in this game?
[2:10:47] <shackbox> you still didn't pick an upgrade
[2:10:47] <%IAmAkiva> Good game or bad game?
[2:10:55] <+maybefalco> i wonder if there's special easter eggs like the first game had
[2:10:57] <CurrySauseBandit> Did he miss the box behind that gate?
[2:10:59] <%IDTheftVictim> Alright game?
[2:10:59] <KangarooCyborg> Looks like quartz from subnautica
[2:10:59] <redsynod> The right game
[2:11:00] <shackbox> fun game w/ issues
[2:11:01] <dekkitout> Sewer meth, dope
[2:11:02] <Prism_Wing> @krawtch They attack your bullets with everything they've got.
[2:11:07] <CalderGaming> good shoots bad writing
[2:11:08] <+Cadwae> He can't see the chest
[2:11:08] <EASrake> AGRESSIVE MANTLE
[2:11:09] <InugamiTheHound> fist those crates with you big fist
[2:11:10] <%deviljhojho94> Looks fine if you skip the story
[2:11:11] <%IAmAkiva> Passing on this game game.
[2:11:12] <+gantz_zero> @IAmAkiva mediocre game with decent gameplay
[2:11:12] <+ChaosVulpes> I like how Pat upgraded the gun, but didn't pick an actual upgrade even though he spent the points to do so. XD
[2:11:12] <+krawtch> i wonder if you can upgrade your melee to be less shit
[2:11:15] <ssks123> i thinkl there was a supply crate to the right of that grate
[2:11:16] <%Laecerelius> this is where you came from
[2:11:18] <Xelhesia> good game with some qol problems
[2:11:18] <+zaworldo> p a t
[2:11:18] <%thebonebard> it seems to be a good game with a lot of narritive shlock holding it back
[2:11:18] <$TehPryceIsRight> thats where you came from
[2:11:20] <Maids4lyfe> you're going backwards
[2:11:22] <@commanderclaw> There was a chest to your left
[2:11:27] <Smart_ZaK1> You are backtracking
[2:11:35] <+zaworldo> pat you gotta pick the upgrade
[2:11:47] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@chemtrailsgaming) (warning)
[2:11:49] <+zaworldo> he'll figure it out I hope eventually
[2:11:50] <%CaptainTubaki> @Onamar i love an id shooter but this is far from what they normally do, dude pre order the game and got bored after i finished the starting level LUL the id gunplay is great but avalanches open nes sis mad boring
[2:11:53] <PROUD2beGINGER> I'm just waiting for the monsters that give you curse
[2:11:56] <+Cadwae> Missed chest where you dropped
[2:12:03] <+WillowMelody> Guys you saw that the upgrade costed a thing he doesn't have yet, right? He didn't pick because he can't.
[2:12:04] <benmpower236> The more I watch, the more I'm leaning toward buying this.
[2:12:09] <$TehPryceIsRight> @angriestPat supply crate was on the left before you dropped down
[2:12:21] <+krawtch> this advanced ai is certainly doing a good job of walking into bullets
[2:12:28] <DevilDeus13> Theyre doing fucking cartwheels around you instead of attacking
[2:12:28] <Xelhesia> lol
[2:12:29] <+Vetto> anyone kinda want pat to die so we can see what the twitch thing does?
[2:12:33] <$MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:12:36] <%Laecerelius> Use that warlock punch!
[2:12:36] <juxtest> This looks a lot like Bulletstorm
[2:12:38] <Djinnazz> Don't know what his plan was.
[2:12:39] <%deviljhojho94> its their own shit
[2:12:40] <thelonechris> Meat moss

[2:12:50] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The Meat Moss is swollen
[2:12:54] <+krawtch> bulletstorm actually had style, i dont know what this game has
[2:12:56] <PROUD2beGINGER> Hurry up and die
[2:12:58] <$Mendin> Into the woolie hole
[2:12:58] <%around_40_jobbers> when do you get to play as Nero?
[2:13:13] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:13:19] <%ElenaManetta> So is the healing thing the only Twitch integration in the game?
[2:13:25] <+Undenizen> Just got here. What are the blue crystals? Is it meth?
[2:13:26] <Saltmeisterr> wheres the buffalo tho
[2:13:26] <$MajorCrasher> LUL LUL

[2:13:29] <Dr_Mooose> 10/10 writing
[2:13:30] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:13:32] <%TombstoneTTromboners> I loved bulletstorm
[2:13:33] <Prism_Wing> I forget you don't get invincibility when you roll irl..
[2:13:34] <%deviljhojho94> but i love my dick
[2:13:35] <$Order_of_Mystery> excited to go to Texas, @angriestpat ?

[2:13:42] <AsterBodhran> BIG meat moss
[2:13:43] <%thebonebard> i wanna see that sfm video
[2:13:48] <a_mad_dragon> was bulletstorm the one with the duke nukem dlc?
[2:13:49] <DevilDeus13> At least Bulletstorm let you think you were playing Wolverine
[2:13:50] <Ion_Laser> replace your dick with a new dick
[2:13:53] <%PanicSwytch> Mr. Waggleton P. Tallylicker
[2:13:53] <$Mendin> These little gollum shits
[2:13:53] <+Noxybaru> icky pooey
[2:13:54] <person181> it looks slower than i thought it would be
[2:13:55] <+Undenizen> *You can't kill what you can't see!*
[2:13:56] <%KaizenChaos> No, I'll kill you dick
[2:13:56] <Smart_ZaK1> If Jennifer Hale killed my dick, I would not complain
[2:13:56] <%thebonebard> has sfm video become synonymous with porn
[2:13:59] <%CaptainTubaki> @a_mad_dragon yea
[2:14:00] <PROUD2beGINGER> rip and tear
[2:14:01] <Kain5707> so is Rage 2 just Doom mixed with Borderlands?
[2:14:02] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat That Duke Nukem DLC for the remaster was weird
[2:14:07] <Jack_DT> is this DOOM?
[2:14:07] <Nina96> is that just DT?
[2:14:09] <%Laecerelius> Watch their organs squirt out like chunky mustard!
[2:14:09] <+krawtch> did you just use your RAGE
[2:14:11] <+chemtrailsgaming> It's just open DOOM
[2:14:11] <%Typhaeon> Fuck ADS.
[2:14:13] <%deviljhojho94> More like doom mixed with mad max
[2:14:14] <+chemtrailsgaming> with no loot
[2:14:15] <shackbox> love hipfiring
[2:14:16] <TheNamelessGun> Well, there's disgusting, and then there's playing a shooter with a controller.
[2:14:16] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat That makes it too easy
[2:14:16] <$Order_of_Mystery> oh yes, there's the ripping and tearing I wanted!
[2:14:17] <Dr_Mooose> Doom
[2:14:21] <Videogamer4> DOOM
[2:14:21] <+DumbRoadkill> Top tier aim
[2:14:21] <+krawtch> DOOOOOM
[2:14:23] <%Typhaeon> It's slow, boring, makes games crawl
[2:14:23] <shackbox> doom is the only good videogame ever made
[2:14:24] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I can confrim that
[2:14:26] <krymzen5> other than doom yeh
[2:14:27] <Crankthulhu> Yes because MUH REALISM
[2:14:28] <$nademonkey1100> forgets about doom
[2:14:32] <CalderGaming> it has to be when ADS changes the fire mode of most of the guns
[2:14:34] <+Undenizen> Are the blue crystals Meth?
[2:14:35] <%Verd_254> hence why this feels like doom to an extent
[2:14:38] <Videogamer4> CRAZY TALM
[2:14:38] <b_ikki> (comment made in 2014)
[2:14:38] <stefannxd> no snipers tho widepeepoSad
[2:14:42] <Justin_Wood> Hey Pat, have you taken a look at CrossCode? finished it last night and it's up there with Nier: Automata, To The Moon, Transistor for me
[2:14:42] <benmpower236> That is some splorchy ass walking noise
[2:14:45] <+Noxybaru> Thank god for id Software and hipfiring
[2:14:45] <+WillowMelody> Titanfall 2 also had great hipfire.
[2:14:45] <%ElenaManetta> Oh you mean the crosshair is where your bullets would fire
[2:14:47] <thelonechris> Ok
[2:14:48] <%thebonebard> i still like the option of aiming sights, not being able to in games like half life drive me a little nuts
[2:14:52] <GoldeNOVA> That's the curse of the consoles
[2:14:56] <metalwater8> Didn’t doom do hip firing?
[2:14:58] <+ultrachibi> the game any good?
[2:14:58] <%Rngiddion> Rngiddion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[2:14:59] <jacksawjack> Well, it finally crashed on me after 10 hours.
[2:14:59] <$SGrim> confirm* woopsADD
[2:14:59] <Smart_ZaK1> Great AI
[2:15:00] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat This looks great but it just makes me want Doom Eternal even more
[2:15:01] <+mobius_won> Titanfall 2 has good hipfire
[2:15:02] <+krawtch> keep in mind, this is on hard difficulty
[2:15:04] <+Qsmash_> old man yells at hips
[2:15:09] <%Faustgesicht> Just finished the beastcast, how's this shit?
[2:15:11] <$El_Desperad0> @metalwater8 no
[2:15:12] <+krawtch> do enemies just kill themselves on normal
[2:15:12] <Dr_Mooose> this area
[2:15:13] <%blaccbird914> are you just doom guy?
[2:15:15] <DevilDeus13> Good ol sewer meth crystals
[2:15:19] <%ElenaManetta> I still play TF2 and crosshair firing is what I figured most shooters have
[2:15:20] <%NWR_James> G U N
[2:15:23] <shackbox> rD
[2:15:23] <%wolfofsound> PogChamp
[2:15:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[2:15:24] <+Eclipse_knight_> you could hip fire in halo just fine
[2:15:24] <+Bad1uck> @mobius_won Titanfall 2 has good everything besides sales numbers\
[2:15:24] <DracaenaLeaf> amazing
[2:15:24] <%deviljhojho94> D:
[2:15:27] <%thebonebard> f
[2:15:29] <+gantz_zero> wow now that's a kmikaze boy
[2:15:30] <+chemtrailsgaming> shoulda gotten A Plague Tale pat
[2:15:34] <%ElenaManetta> HEY I just noticed
[2:15:36] <+Pomfles> is this the love child of Doom and Warframe? the noises of the enemies make me think of Warframe goons
[2:15:38] <%deviljhojho94> LUL
[2:15:39] <DestroyerPhoenix> Bad1uck simFeels
[2:15:39] <%ElenaManetta> The crosshair has a little skull when you kill things
[2:15:39] <DracaenaLeaf> t-they can jump?
[2:15:42] <%around_40_jobbers> Enemies DO kill htemselves PogChamp
[2:15:44] <+mobius_won> @bad1uck sadly yeah
[2:15:55] <+Blackgaver> fallout and doom had a child
[2:15:56] <$nademonkey1100> DOOM!? again
[2:15:57] <benmpower236> Pat vs Sewer Mutants, or alternatively, Sewer Mutant civil war.
[2:15:59] <Smart_ZaK1> DOOM
[2:16:04] <%tinkerinks> tinkerinks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! a whole damn year what
[2:16:04] <%Taisuru> Shotgun is most important weapon in a shooter IMO
[2:16:06] <%CaptainTubaki> @Faustgesicht the id software shooting is good bud the avalanche parts are meh
[2:16:06] <DracaenaLeaf> Firefly
[2:16:07] <%ElenaManetta> NO
[2:16:08] <Prism_Wing> why are we all on fire, really?
[2:16:09] <%ElenaManetta> what
[2:16:11] <+agentnuma> killing floor 2 has great shotguns
[2:16:12] <CalderGaming> oh no ghost flame
[2:16:13] <PROUD2beGINGER> I clapped when I saw it
[2:16:14] <dekkitout> My Tigris Prime would beg to differ
[2:16:15] <+ProfessorDetective052996> Well, this IS an id game, they know their shotguns.
[2:16:22] <zach13> You think they added the pink embellishments because this is otherwise incredibly generic, visually? Looks like a “Podcast” type game.
[2:16:24] <DevilDeus13> "We designed these enemies to not want to live"
[2:16:26] <CalderGaming> it's half an id game
[2:16:26] <jacksawjack> Overdrive Hipfire shotgun is basically the old DOOM shotty.
[2:16:29] <eyedol33> not sure that's true
[2:16:32] <+Noxybaru> If you can't get a shotgun right then you should reconsider making a shooter
[2:16:33] <+gantz_zero> infLusion
[2:16:36] <+chemtrailsgaming> A shotgun is fun. If the shotgun isnt fun, why bother?
[2:16:36] <+Bad1uck> Influsion
[2:16:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Pomfles Those baddies from the beginning did look a lot like Grineer after all
[2:16:39] <Ion_Laser> damn mutie goo
[2:16:39] <%ElenaManetta> You're gonna give yourself the flu
[2:16:40] <%Faustgesicht> This is a doom mod from the nexus and you can't convince me otherwise
[2:16:41] <%ItsRatman> Yo chat, what's your favorite shotgun from video games?
[2:16:41] <+Eclipse_knight_> halo 1 shotgun best gun
[2:16:45] <$Order_of_Mystery> the bioslime
[2:16:46] <ScreamingMeat> Meat Moss EVERYWHERE
[2:16:47] <%wvuboii> id softeware knows their shotguns
[2:16:48] <+chemtrailsgaming> Killzone 2
[2:16:48] <eyedol33> I can name more good shotguns than bad ones
[2:16:50] <InugamiTheHound> that stuff looks like shit from Dead space 1 and 2
[2:16:50] <+Gogetta159> Its Avalanche Stuiods I thought
[2:16:51] <+chemtrailsgaming> Hands down
[2:16:54] <%ElenaManetta> TF2 shotgun because I'm biased
[2:16:54] <EASrake> Is this Yuri?
[2:16:55] <+Undenizen> crack & flush
[2:16:58] <$Order_of_Mystery> @eclipse_knight_ fuck yeah!
[2:16:58] <$serpenttucker> Was that duke?
[2:17:02] <Smart_ZaK1> This was not outstanding, they just kill themselves!
[2:17:04] <+cahv123> why do I feel like he doesn't mean flush out the gunk?
[2:17:04] <Ion_Laser> doom 1 shotgun best shotgun
[2:17:05] <Djinnazz> Doom shotgun best shotgun, what are you on?
[2:17:14] <%deviljhojho94> Big boy
[2:17:14] <+Noxybaru> The shotgun from FEAR is a strong competitor
[2:17:15] <Dr_Mooose> oh boy
[2:17:19] <+Evitron1> you must have big guts
[2:17:19] <%ElenaManetta> HOLY SHIT
[2:17:20] <jacksawjack> Original DOOM shotgun is best shotgun
[2:17:20] <%deviljhojho94> Motherfucking BADDON WARHEHAD
[2:17:21] <suddenlyscorched> Blood shotgun's good
[2:17:22] <%ElenaManetta> His HP bar fucking DRAINED
[2:17:23] <+Evitron1> rip and tear your big guts
[2:17:24] <+chemtrailsgaming> Killzone 2's shotgun was like blasting a cannon blowing a load every time you shot it
[2:17:24] <%Typhaeon> Life's already half gone? Wow.
[2:17:24] <%ElenaManetta> This is hard mode, folks
[2:17:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's huge, which must mean he has huge guts
[2:17:26] <$nademonkey1100> SHOOT MY WEAKPOINT
[2:17:26] <CalderGaming> avalanche did most of the design, id was mostly technical stuff
[2:17:30] <dekkitout> What health bar?
[2:17:31] <+mmSoTasty> he's very protective of his goo
[2:17:31] <+krawtch> doom shotgun was 1) a good shotgun 2) a grenade launcher and 3) a triple shotgun
[2:17:32] <+WillowMelody> ... what an impressive boss.
[2:17:34] <CurrySauseBandit> You do so much damage in this difficulty NotLikeThis
[2:17:35] <%CaptainTubaki> @ItsRatman the super shotgun im not a fan of shotguns but the only one i ever liked is the long double barrel mainly in dooms
[2:17:41] <%Typhaeon> Are you on Normal difficulty here? Because it seems very easy
[2:17:42] <+Bad1uck> you're huge, which means you have HUGE GUTS
[2:17:43] <+Champine> cheese
[2:17:46] <+Evitron1> buckaroo this is HARD?
[2:17:46] <PROUD2beGINGER> ABADON THE DESPOILER??
[2:17:46] <benmpower236> That is a big thicc boi.
[2:17:47] <+krawtch> this is on HARD
[2:17:48] <%ElenaManetta> That health bar might as well have been a suggestion.
[2:17:51] <Nina96> nice doge
[2:17:56] <%deviljhojho94> Oh damn
[2:17:57] <%Typhaeon> How the hell is this hard
[2:17:57] <CalderGaming> the credit sequence is already on youtube and fairly short if anyone's curious about who was responsible for what
[2:17:57] <jacksawjack> It's the Battlelord from Duke Nukem!
[2:18:00] <Smart_ZaK1> And he's dead
[2:18:03] <juxtest> Did he kill himself
[2:18:12] <+krawtch> maybe they will patch in some difficulty in 3-4 months
[2:18:14] <eyedol33> lol he died when you weren't even looking
[2:18:19] <benmpower236> Big thicc boi is prone to accidents.
[2:18:24] <EASrake> That might have been an introduction of a regular enemy
[2:18:25] <+Bad1uck> @typhaeon don't worry, the combat becomes bullshit later
[2:18:27] <dadeaner> has @AngriestPat jumped up the ladders yet?
[2:18:28] <DKDiamantes> My Overdrive still doesn't work ;-;
[2:18:28] <%around_40_jobbers> if only dashes were omnidirectional
[2:18:33] <%Typhaeon> Oh, so it's THAT kind of difficulty
[2:18:36] <CurrySauseBandit> Just go to Nightmare. The difficulty is actually a thing there.
[2:18:39] <%Typhaeon> Well, it'll be fun to watch at least
[2:18:39] <raincoatponch> maybe it actually gets harder as the game goes?
[2:18:41] <+Evitron1> inb4 everyone starts complaining that sekiro discourse ruined the difficulty on this
[2:18:43] <%thebonebard> i would like to hope it ramps up later
[2:18:47] <%ElenaManetta> But why is it so easy
[2:18:56] <+chemtrailsgaming> It's like DOOM with no personality or style
[2:18:58] <%ElenaManetta> What happened to the studio where they were like NO, IT'S GOTTA BE LIKE THIS
[2:19:03] <jacksawjack> The difficulty is killing the enemies before they kill themselves.
[2:19:07] <%ElenaManetta> Was Rage 1 difficulty complained about?
[2:19:07] <dekkitout> *Cuts to old Polygon Doom video* monkaS
[2:19:12] <+krawtch> the strategy seems to be "wait until enemies run up to kiss your shotgun"
[2:19:14] <mastermidget23> Someone spray painted that valve Pink.
[2:19:19] <CalderGaming> @ElenaManetta no one played rage 1 lol
[2:19:20] <%LymanAl> BOX
[2:19:21] <Ion_Laser> "tough muties"
[2:19:25] <CalderGaming> trust me, i'm no one
[2:19:26] <+chemtrailsgaming> It's pink because this game is CRAZY
[2:19:27] <+krawtch> or just blast them while they do breakdance moves for no reason
[2:19:28] <dekkitout> Was Rage 1 played by more than 50 people?
[2:19:30] <+Bad1uck> @elenamanetta poor balancing by the devs. The combat becomes way more complicated in boss fights
[2:19:31] <eyedol33> tough . . . yeah
[2:19:35] <shackbox> why?
[2:19:35] <%thebonebard> apply shotgun directly to supple mutie lips
[2:19:37] <+gantz_zero> rage 1 was decently challenging
[2:19:41] <+gantz_zero> not like just piss easy
[2:19:42] <+krawtch> i played rage 1 for maybe 3 hours
[2:19:43] <Ion_Laser> no power
[2:19:44] <shackbox> why would the service elevator do that?
[2:19:45] <Daxalog> No Power
[2:19:45] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat No power
[2:19:45] <Nina96> power out?
[2:19:45] <Onamar> Because the power was dead
[2:19:49] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat Is this game good?
[2:19:49] <%Typhaeon> Yeah the first had the opposite problem
[2:19:51] <$serpenttucker> No...power?
[2:19:59] <+krawtch> the greatest challenge in rage 1 was the mouse acceleration was a piece of shit
[2:20:02] <+ChaosVulpes> Adorable cat is adorable
[2:20:04] <+Evitron1> walker: yeah i got MOMMY ISSUES what UP
[2:20:04] <VJdarkworld> elmo > rage 2

[2:20:24] <$serpenttucker> FUCK THE MAN, MAN
[2:20:26] <CalderGaming> the melee enemies scrambling around were more interesting in rage 1 because you didn't have a fuck-off magic palm thrust
[2:20:29] <+ChaosVulpes> Walker, Texas Ranger
[2:20:30] <shackbox> Walker Ranger?

[2:20:42] <redsynod> Gotta take out HHH and Steph
[2:20:43] <+gantz_zero> what's your handle? xNAKEDxSExALOTx
[2:20:45] <%DSD24> @bonzosan Good?
[2:20:46] <benmpower236> I can't get over The Authority. Someone needs to Mad Max HHH to death.
[2:20:49] <Almondite> is pat feeling the Rage?
[2:20:53] <+PigGuy800> respect my authority!
[2:20:54] <+mmSoTasty> that's still the worst name, "The Authority"
[2:20:55] <+asgard147> He a smelly pillow
[2:20:55] <Daxalog> uh huh
[2:20:55] <%Typhaeon> You're right
[2:20:56] <%PalmtopNami> All I can see is Sam Rigeal
[2:20:57] <+krawtch> its "Protagonist Voice 3"
[2:20:59] <tank7013> Jesus it just hit me that the main evil force is just called "The Authority"
[2:21:03] <+Undenizen> You're not the first person to suggest it!
[2:21:05] <%Typhaeon> Animals are better people than people
[2:21:05] <+Evitron1> you can tell it more by how animals react to someone
[2:21:05] <Sloavon> absolutely
[2:21:07] <starotter70> Same
[2:21:08] <+mmSoTasty> lol same
[2:21:09] <CurrySauseBandit> I've met plenty of shitty people that are nice to animals.
[2:21:10] <%anticrust> Correct
[2:21:11] <PROUD2beGINGER> Woolie
[2:21:12] <+ChaosVulpes> Animals can sense evil
[2:21:12] <+chemtrailsgaming> Rage 1 sold 2.31 mil copies apparently
[2:21:12] <Dr_Mooose> didn't you not want Elmo at first?
[2:21:13] <mastermidget23> Woolie
[2:21:13] <Cymen90> DISGUSTING

[2:21:17] <benmpower236> If you mistreat animals, you can get kicked off a bridge.
[2:21:18] <%deviljhojho94> Hitler loved dogs
[2:21:19] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat there have been tons of animal lovers that were evil
[2:21:20] <$MajorCrasher> there are murderers who love animals
[2:21:20] <Sloavon> psychotic
[2:21:22] <Coystick> Oh yeah, animals are a dipstick of the human soul
[2:21:22] <+chemtrailsgaming> which suprises the hell out of me
[2:21:24] <DevilDeus13> Putting Woolie on blast
[2:21:26] <RupanSen> eh, it depends
[2:21:26] <%thebonebard> even nazis liked dogs
[2:21:26] <%drabberfaun535> Woolie
[2:21:27] <mistersups> I'm fine with the main VO, Sam Reigel is a good guy.
[2:21:29] <DracaenaLeaf> what if someone loved cats but wasn't all that fond of dogs?
[2:21:31] <Ominnous> before the toxo
[2:21:32] <Bouldus> im significantly more likely to trust a dog then a person, dogs more often make better people then people do
[2:21:33] <+Deano8817> oof
[2:21:33] <Xelhesia> what if they have trauma
[2:21:38] <$Mendin> You didn't want elmo u ntil you had the toxo
[2:21:40] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat That is how I felt when Woolie talked about Palicos
[2:21:40] <+dangerillustrated> people who like dogs and then hate cats ugh
[2:21:41] <CalderGaming> @chemtrailsgaming is that to date, 8 years later?

[2:21:43] <dekkitout> 2.31 mill? Is that good, sales numbers make no sense to me really
[2:21:44] <$Tuskor13> I mean it's only really acceptable to not be want to near a dog or cat if you're allergic or scared of dogs cuz you were bit as a kid or something
[2:21:44] <VJdarkworld> but what if its a CGI dog? u cant get close to those!
[2:21:45] <raincoatponch> if you dont respond to seeing a dog or cat with "can i pet it" theres something wrong with you
[2:21:45] <+krawtch> dogs give it away for free
[2:21:46] <a_mad_dragon> and if you're a member of peta, you should be dragged out and shot in the street like the pet murderer you are
[2:21:46] <%arancet> you forced elmo upon you

[2:22:02] <rytisone> like father like son
[2:22:04] <%PalmtopNami> yall are missing the point, it's not that animal lovers are good it's that non animal lovers are just not that pleasant.

[2:23:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> melee grenades back at people?
[2:23:11] <+krawtch> they use their hands to distract your attention away from their horribly (or sometimes not at all) animated faces
[2:23:13] <EASrake> that looks fucking janky. i love it
[2:23:13] <Bouldus> @PalmtopNami people in general are unpleasant, but ill put up with it to pet the animal

[2:23:46] <InugamiTheHound> did pat upgrade his guns? and pick a perk?
[2:23:47] <%ElenaManetta> I would say unlock more scavenge things first because you aren't having trouble with combat
[2:23:47] <ninjaguiden> you have to pick the weapon upgraades @AngriestPat
[2:23:52] <%deviljhojho94> why pat
[2:24:06] <@Mechz71> time to restart the game over again
[2:24:08] <DKDiamantes> That final tier makes it stupid good, they just chuck it and even if its lying on the ground it flings it right back at them
[2:24:23] <CurrySauseBandit> WEapon tinkering is good
[2:24:25] <CalderGaming> double checked and yeah, rage 1 was the first idtech 5 game, 3 years before wolfenstein new order

[2:29:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 29m.
[2:29:54] <%jiin6> BlessRNG
[2:29:56] <%Rancaliber_> BlessRNG
[2:29:59] <%DedlokPM> apatDab Gesundheit, @AngriestPat
[2:30:03] <DKDiamantes> The map is a little on the small side, but seems like theres always objective things to do anyway
[2:30:04] <$Tuskor13> Is this Borderlands
[2:30:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> inseert peenic in Waifu Car
[2:30:05] <CalderGaming> @Bouldus made mostly by Avalanche, the Just Cause devs, and partly by id
[2:30:06] <%Bt_Robot> "Hello Ranger, he he eh"
[2:30:06] <+YabbaTroll> is there first person driving in this?
[2:30:09] <DKDiamantes> Which beats a giant map with fucking nothing to do
[2:30:09] <benmpower236> That is a strong Borderland vive coming through right now.
[2:30:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Borderlands meets Mad Max meets Red Faction

[2:30:16] <demegodz> Uhh
[2:30:16] <mastermidget23> Well this guy's super dead.
[2:30:18] <+mmSoTasty> ew what
[2:30:18] <redsynod> Better be steve blum
[2:30:19] <%deviljhojho94> Wholesome
[2:30:21] <%ElenaManetta> This is really pretty at night
[2:30:22] <Bouldus> @CalderGaming ok
[2:30:24] <demegodz> Flirt with him
[2:30:25] <thelonechris> Khorne?
[2:30:28] <$Tuskor13> Skulls for the Skull Throne
[2:30:31] <%deviljhojho94> Seduce the old man
[2:30:34] <+krawtch> day 1 DLC - check
[2:30:34] <raincoatponch> skulls for the skull throne
[2:30:34] <%laundrysauce2> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[2:30:35] <%polyseif> blood for blood god
[2:30:36] <MrPwng3> theres dlc already?
[2:30:42] <dekkitout> The Death Gods demand 410 billion deaths
[2:30:44] <DrkJP520> How come people aren't talking about AoT? There are already like 3 new episodes
[2:30:49] <DKDiamantes> Yeah there's a Pre-Order DLC mission thing
[2:30:51] <%deviljhojho94> Kill 6 billion gods
[2:30:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So its another copy and paste open world?
[2:30:51] <%DedlokPM> Pre order dlc I assume
[2:31:04] <MrPwng3> ah gotchca, thanks guys
[2:31:12] <asurite_warrior> @krawtch Don't be like that man. This honestly looks really fun.
[2:31:16] <+krawtch> in-game currency microtransaction - check
[2:31:20] <%MightyMaxT> At least SamSho is doing the preorder DLC thing smart. It just gives you the season pass for free
[2:31:20] <Daxalog> People stopped talking about AOT for a while now. I think people are only watching for character death at this point
[2:31:28] <Pallion_> Borderlands without the humor
[2:31:37] <+krawtch> RAGE coins : $6.49 CND on the steam store
[2:31:51] <dekkitout> @Daxalog There will be a SURPLUS then
[2:31:52] <%Tman451> just got here, hows the game?
[2:31:54] <Almondite> Aptly named currency
[2:31:56] <%thebonebard> i think that lady just said pat was smelly
[2:32:01] <%deviljhojho94> Borderlands without the humor sounds like the kind of game I would want honestly LUL
[2:32:03] <CurrySauseBandit> @AngriestPat Could you try nightmare difficulty for a bit?
[2:32:04] <$ClockUp> @daxalog manga readers don’t like to talk about it very much now it’s kinda a hot mess
[2:32:08] <Ion_Laser> @Tman451 seems ok
[2:32:11] <DrunkenEdubs> Is this the game with the mean lesbians?
[2:32:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Microtransactions are for cowards
[2:32:18] <DrkJP520> Wise words
[2:32:18] <CalderGaming> Junkie Lady is voiced by Amanda Troop, who hasn't done many other roles... she did Irene in Ninja Gaiden 3, apparently?
[2:32:19] <+krawtch> so to get that DLC mission you need to buy the deluxe edition apparently, for $110
[2:32:20] <MrPwng3> anyone know is pat has seen any iceborne stuff yet? was waiting for him to talk about it in the podcast but he hasnt yet
[2:32:23] <+Blackgaver> don't do microtransactions chat... it's drugs
[2:32:24] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is that twitch extension
[2:32:24] <+YabbaTroll> @DrunkenEdubs heh
[2:32:26] <Nina96> just do it
[2:32:26] <%jiin6> pro tip: say no to drugs
[2:32:27] <%ElenaManetta> Oh I thought when people said switch to nightmare, that was a joke
[2:32:30] <%ElenaManetta> Like they wish they game had nightmare
[2:32:30] <KangarooCyborg> wow rocks just die
[2:32:31] <Maids4lyfe> what are rage coins? the mtx store?
[2:32:32] <+krawtch> over a hundred dollars
[2:32:41] <%DedlokPM> Probably because most of the people who care about AoT these days decided to read the manga instead of waiting for the anime. They may still be watching but their desire to talk about what is happening in the anime is long past
[2:32:43] <midgetzoo> Why you drivin the Mako?
[2:32:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Say no to fermented shit
[2:32:55] <%ElenaManetta> These ares are really pretty at night
[2:32:58] <%MattDemers> I like how they say MURDERING
[2:32:59] <%joylent_blue> MrPwng3 they talked about it in yesterday's podcast
[2:33:03] <DrunkenEdubs> @AngriestPat did you play dragon's dogma? what'd you think?
[2:33:11] <Funcokler_Xerow> gain goodwill by murder
[2:33:13] <+kawachipto> lvl 6, idk if he's ready
[2:33:15] <%jiin6> here pat goes murdering again
[2:33:16] <+DukeMoose> he liked dragonsdogma
[2:33:18] <%Tman451> does the gunplay feel like Dooms?
[2:33:19] <asurite_warrior> Be back in a bit needed to update a driver
[2:33:19] <%PlainSimpleTailor> YEYEYE SHOTEE
[2:33:26] <KangarooCyborg> This hand of mine is glowing pink. It's cyber girth tells me to defeat you!
[2:33:29] <$ClockUp> I got impatient waiting for Titan so o read the manga. I watch it now with my girlfriend cause she’s still blind to it but I wanna see her reactions
[2:33:35] <Almondite> Dragon's Dogma full play-through when
[2:33:37] <dekkitout> I was really into AoT manga, then the 'blimp thing' happened ant it went downhill for me
[2:33:40] <A_d3adly_zambo> the hell
[2:33:42] <%thebonebard> what was that spongebob music
[2:33:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wtf
[2:33:43] <+Undenizen> No mission that EVER starts "Just check in on them" has them just be there.
[2:33:44] <+mmSoTasty> them goons is tough
[2:33:46] <+krawtch> can you defib infinitely
[2:33:49] <Daxalog> The minigame didnt come up
[2:33:51] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat so this is farcry future 80s movie?
[2:33:53] <MrPwng3> @joylent_blue ah thanks bro, been checking his twitter feed for it and only have been getting caught up on the podcast tonight so must not have reached it yet :D

[2:34:00] <+gantz_zero> yeah the minigame didn't do fuckall
[2:34:02] <CurrySauseBandit> @krawtch It's got a cooldown
[2:34:03] <%GarbageNirvana> hm
[2:34:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> man

[2:34:21] <+Reveresao> boooooo
[2:34:22] <%RoninRorinth> so would you say buy this game or wait for something better?
[2:34:22] <cherrycottontail> for the twitch integration
[2:34:24] <@commanderclaw> :Wait what
[2:34:25] <CommanderCOOL> hard mode is the best balance
[2:34:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> what an increase
[2:34:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> honestly if Blood Dragon became a full fledged series, it could still be the defacto neon-fps shooter
[2:34:36] <+BloodborneSammich> This fame doesn’t look great
[2:34:36] <CurrySauseBandit> Wait is that place level 6?
[2:34:39] <%Tman451> lowers difficulty, runs away
[2:34:48] <+mmSoTasty> there's twitch integration?
[2:34:49] <%joylent_blue> MrPwng3 yeah they def talked about it this week :D
[2:34:52] <KangarooCyborg> You didn't win
[2:34:54] <+krawtch> a feature in a bethesda game not working? color me shocked
[2:35:02] <californaya> (grunt of effort)
[2:35:02] <%jiin6> twitch go? oh no
[2:35:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Jackpot
[2:35:12] <CalderGaming> are we supposed to click the screen or press keys
[2:35:13] <+krawtch> JACKPOT
[2:35:16] <$Mendin> Goonie goonie goon baby!
[2:35:22] <dekkitout> DON'T Say it.
[2:35:23] <thelonechris> Is this Detroit?
[2:35:25] <%spacehouse> like a fall out place
[2:35:26] <+Bupkis7> He was invisible
[2:35:30] <+gantz_zero> i have no idea because it doesn't even say what to do
[2:35:32] <+WillowMelody> I think he was cloaked. Those guys can cloak.
[2:35:36] <Djinnazz> CLOAK PAT.
[2:35:39] <%MostFrank> Nuke town is great
[2:35:49] <californaya> this is like what if Destiny were interesting
[2:35:55] <%DedlokPM> yes. it almost looks like some groups had some sort of fall out here. rooSmug
[2:35:55] <+Starlight_Gamer> Has Pat needed a defib?
[2:36:02] <CalderGaming> "Viewers can help by using their own Defibrillator controls"
[2:36:11] <CalderGaming> it doesn't say what those are
[2:36:15] <+gantz_zero> yep
[2:36:18] <+krawtch> where the fuck are your bullets going
[2:36:32] <KangarooCyborg> yay mist!
[2:36:33] <californaya> splorch
[2:36:34] <+krawtch> do they come out sideways 60% of the time
[2:36:36] <%ElenaManetta> It's probably too early to ask "how long to beat", but it's only been 2.5 and it feels like Pat's gotten a lot of upgrades + guns
[2:36:43] <Saltmeisterr> chunky
[2:36:44] <+chemtrailsgaming> the fuck is this music
[2:36:48] <%ElenaManetta> 2.5 hours that is
[2:36:57] <+Starlight_Gamer> What are those defib controls? Do you need the play the game as we are watching this?
[2:37:02] <+zaworldo> yeah nothin
[2:37:02] <+BoomerTiro> So how is "Fallout but 80s instead of 50s" the Sequel?
[2:37:02] <%Verd_254> nope
[2:37:03] <%iwishthiswasicq> The idea that anger makes bullets hurt more will always be dumb to me.
[2:37:04] <%ElenaManetta> No
[2:37:07] <KaseKaizer> nada
[2:37:07] <Gameslayer2> no
[2:37:07] <DracaenaLeaf> dunno
[2:37:08] <californaya> nothing popped up
[2:37:08] <CalderGaming> okay last time it was 25% was that us or pat doing worse
[2:37:10] <NickHatesSnow> nope
[2:37:10] <simulationbard> How doe sit work
[2:37:11] <+krawtch> the extension is a thing we have to install
[2:37:11] <+gantz_zero> we fucking would but it's trash
[2:37:12] <%ElenaManetta> I didn't even believe you the first time when you said that was a Twitch minigame
[2:37:13] <ZZCooldown> i helped :)
[2:37:15] <rytisone> I tried, didnt know if that helped
[2:37:17] <+kawachipto> he only has 3 guns how does that seem like he is far lol
[2:37:19] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat noting popped up for us to do anything
[2:37:21] <+chemtrailsgaming> what the fuck is even happening
[2:37:22] <%PopulousNix> Tried lol
[2:37:24] <%kewlmyc> Enemies seem like bullet sponges
[2:37:24] <$nademonkey1100> "twitch integrating"
[2:37:26] <dekkitout> Does the extension need to be enabled, there's a few that do that
[2:37:28] <Cranky_Construct> just got here but man this looks pretty cool
[2:37:34] <QaizerArt> @CalderGaming He missed a prompt in the defib
[2:37:37] <Djinnazz> i WAS on.
[2:37:39] <+krawtch> we have to install the extension on our end
[2:37:43] <+Undenizen> what's the extension supposed to do?
[2:37:44] <MrPwng3> it's an extension? shit that reminds me of the battlefield 4 commander moed
[2:37:44] <%FrustratedAF> so... how's it lookin?
[2:37:44] <Fien111> @Cranky_Construct Prepare for dissapointment
[2:37:48] <+gantz_zero> i SEE it but it doesn't do anything

[2:37:54] <+DrPoxx> extension needs to be installed and linked to chats own bethesda accounts
[2:37:56] <%Ultradoom333> yo, cool stuff goes down in this game. this is such a good sequel to a not good game

[2:40:32] <@commanderclaw> Time to accept the plugin
[2:40:37] <$Valdorick> Seems like the slam attack in Warframe - amazing to behold, AWFUL IN PRACTICE.
[2:40:39] <%Bt_Robot> Why plug in not work?
[2:40:43] <+meatgeneral69> is this normal difficulty?
[2:40:46] <+Mdub98> just tuned in, is it good?
[2:40:46] <CalderGaming> @angriestpat you linked your bethesda account for the defib extension right?
[2:40:52] <cherrycottontail> Hey pat can you get downed again so I can test the extension?
[2:40:59] <californaya> I have no fucking idea what my Bethesda password is
[2:41:00] <+WillowMelody> @meatgeneral69 Hard.
[2:41:02] <%aperez928> @Cranky_Construct Avalanche and ID together
[2:41:09] <%Ultradoom333> @krawtch im not a political guy, but i just didnt appreciate the social pandering on top of the reused BL2 gameplay assets
[2:41:09] <+cowkid222> sup gang. Any general feelings on this so far? Looks pretty cool so far.
[2:41:18] <Cranky_Construct> shit okay so its a must-buy to me at least then once I have money
[2:41:19] <+Saltima> You feeling the difficulty now?
[2:41:21] <CurrySauseBandit> @AngriestPat Check to see if your still on nightmare difficulty. It might not have saved. o3o
[2:41:21] <CalderGaming> chat only the streamer installs anything
[2:41:24] <%ElenaManetta> So nightmare mode is what you actually want to play
[2:41:32] <juxtest> It was me, I saved him
[2:41:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> guess you're no longer in the tutorial area
[2:41:40] <Saltmeisterr> i don't see t
[2:41:50] <%crimsonharvest> upgrade your shit nerd
[2:41:52] <+krawtch> @Ultradoom333 i never got that far. i played for like 2 hours and the game hard crashed and i wasnt interested in launching it again
[2:41:55] <$Valdorick> Nice shooting tex
[2:41:55] <eyedol33> lol
[2:41:55] <DevilDeus13> Crazy Talked the difficulty up
[2:41:58] <@commanderclaw> Accept the plugin
[2:42:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Is that a Jojo enemy
[2:42:03] <%ElenaManetta> I'm really curious as to how fast enemies drop on Easy

[2:42:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL everyone becomes a fodder
[2:42:22] <%BallinArbiter> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:42:23] <$SGrim> Big Brain 4Head
[2:42:26] <lezzan94> nice one pat
[2:42:33] <Ominnous> you have to link your Bethesda account to twitch to use the extension
[2:42:41] <Ominnous> the viewers*
[2:42:48] <starotter70> wow
[2:42:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[2:42:50] <%Ultradoom333> @krawtch i beat ot with every class. its not great
[2:42:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ASPLODE
[2:42:53] <+chemtrailsgaming> So i see this game does difficulty completely wrong too
[2:42:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[2:42:58] <+Gogetta159> I think the linking is just on pat to do
[2:43:01] <LtThunderbolt> no aim
[2:43:07] <%FrustratedAF> so its some kinda... bethesda presents DOOM?
[2:43:11] <CalderGaming> @Ominnous the instructions imply pretty strongly that only the streamer needs to
[2:43:13] <+krawtch> 4 difficulty levels: nightmare (normal), hard (easy), normal (baby) and easy (journalist)
[2:43:18] <$WackyXmand> yeah I need a Bethesda account as well to help, which logically i don't have
[2:43:27] <Thedingusmcmingus> hey I see you are playing Fallout: Doom
[2:43:31] <cherrycottontail> But doom was already bethesda presents doom
[2:43:32] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat did you follow the 8 steps to link the plugin to your bethesda account
[2:43:33] <%aperez928> @FrustratedAF Bethesda only published this.
[2:43:42] <%Ultradoom333> @frustratedaf the creators of Just Cause and the Creators of Doom got together to make this
[2:43:43] <px120> @FrustratedAF Didn't Bethesda already publish Doom?
[2:43:48] <%aperez928> @FrustratedAF They also published Doom
[2:43:50] <CalderGaming> welp i dunno
[2:43:50] <MrPwng3> doomhonored
[2:43:55] <+chemtrailsgaming> DOOM Single player dlc died for this
[2:44:05] <%D33TR> D33TR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! thanks for the great content as always, if you're ever in winnipeg (hah) i'll buy you a red bull
[2:44:05] <+Gogetta159> Doomerlands
[2:44:09] <Pallion_> Fallout: Doomlands
[2:44:11] <%FrustratedAF> i think perez wins that...
[2:44:18] <+Saltima> so there seems to be a bit of a bullet time when you slam. if you can increase the time so you can shoot while they're ragdolled that'd being real bulletstorm shit
[2:44:19] <$Valdorick> Nanomachines, son?
[2:44:23] <+gantz_zero> bullshit, doom made enough money to develop anything they wanted @chemtrailsgaming
[2:44:23] <cant_pick_a_name> @angriestpat have you tried giving me $100 to make it work
[2:44:28] <$El_Desperad0> @chemtrailsgaming Doom single player dlc was never confirmed or promised

[2:45:57] <cherrycottontail> When did plague make a game
[2:45:58] <%aperez928> Bethesda publishes a lot of good stuff, they don't just develop. They published the new Wolfenstein games, Dishonored, Prey

[2:46:36] <CalderGaming> the sequel was a buggy pile of garbage
[2:46:36] <Xelhesia> that game is a 15 hour escort mission still good tho
[2:46:36] <televisedrevolting> @someasiandood Sam Riegel, actually.

[2:46:55] <$Order_of_Mystery> @angriestpat have you heard how high Jerma's voice can go? he legitimately sounds like an airhorn
[2:46:55] <+Gogetta159> 2 wasn't that bad of a game just a bad sequel
[2:46:56] <%Dr_DangerPhD> best part of mercs 2 was the song they used for the commercials lol
[2:46:58] <$El_Desperad0> M2 IS that bad
[2:46:58] <+BoomerTiro> Pat why do you not like Mercenaries 2?

[2:47:36] <CalderGaming> seems like the kind of game that could use a RADIO

[2:56:47] <%Sovspot> is this game worth picking up full price
[2:56:47] <energywarning> a bug but a blessing in disguise
[2:56:47] <+krawtch> we forgot to animate a face for that line too
[2:56:47] <+Noxybaru> Please, everyone, tell me your life story when I first interact with you
[2:56:47] <MrLittleSam> ???
[2:56:47] <T0KK0Knight> She was merely pretending
[2:56:49] <GalaKnight> At least now we know it's a real Bethesda game
[2:56:50] <Sloavon> "lemme do that one again"
[2:56:50] <BreakTheBarrier> SILENCE BOOMER
[2:56:51] <Ion_Laser> 10/10 GOTY material here!
[2:56:51] <+krawtch> along with every other line
[2:56:52] <%Sovspot> or should i wait for a sale
[2:56:53] <+MechaBaphomet> go to the premium shop Kappa
[2:56:53] <person181> how did this get released
[2:56:56] <+Mr_Pylon> Born On The Bayou would be a weird stand
[2:56:58] <CalderGaming> JoJo played by Orion Acaba
[2:56:58] <+BoomerTiro> I will not be silent!
[2:57:02] <%Luna_Ashford> Why is everyone saying "Shut up boomer"?
[2:57:08] <californaya> This might be the first game I've seen where 90% of the NPCs (it seems like) are female. Not that I mind, it's just interesting.
[2:57:11] <+Mittensbro> @Luna_Ashford shut up boomer
[2:57:12] <%Deekman> What was that pyromancer doing?~
[2:57:13] <+BoomerTiro> I have a shop in the game!
[2:57:14] <+paladinstarbuster> DEEP SEKRETO
[2:57:16] <+BoomerTiro> Aww yeah!
[2:57:16] <dekkitout> I didn't notice that over the goddamn Battle Tendency reference!
[2:57:20] <%Luna_Ashford> Helpful you were not
[2:57:21] <Pookiedaexzile> hey look its someone in sunglasses, how quirky
[2:57:22] <+krawtch> this game looks like the most "maybe when its 70% off" game
[2:57:32] <%king_wragles> Oh, I thought you were joking @AngriestPat ...
[2:57:35] <vinceshamwowslap> What even is rage one like
[2:57:42] <SomeAsianDood> @vinceshamwowslap grey and brown
[2:57:42] <Djinnazz> boring
[2:57:43] <VRNK> generic
[2:57:44] <%king_wragles> I'm guessing this is PC?
[2:57:47] <energywarning> brown
[2:57:50] <Ion_Laser> @king_wragles yeah
[2:57:53] <vinceshamwowslap> hmm
[2:57:54] <%king_wragles> later

[2:57:59] <%Jacobblast> Jacobblast subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! hi pat
[2:58:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @vinceshamwowslap great shooting but terrible everything else
[2:58:06] <QaizerArt> Lagooney, the town he's in, has been the most interesting place yet
[2:58:07] <coltdemont> What is this game?
[2:58:10] <%deviljhojho94> fuck that car
[2:58:13] <Xelhesia> disappointment of the lowest calibur

[2:58:14] <%Remery_> You can fuck the car?
[2:58:15] <+bubblebasspickles> OwO
[2:58:18] <starotter70> Finally
[2:58:18] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat do you think you'll keep playing this game on your own time?
[2:58:18] <+krawtch> rage 1 is a bunch of motherfuckers bossing you around, telling you to go do their chores and shit and you have to do them all because you have no voice or player agency outside of shooting everyone
[2:58:21] <californaya> l-lewd
[2:58:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Somebody snitch to paige
[2:58:25] <rytisone> have sex with a car

[2:58:37] <TwinBat> future dlc
[2:58:37] <$WackyXmand> the car voice sounds like Lazy Susan from Gravity Falls
[2:58:38] <T0KK0Knight> Can cars get preggers?

[2:58:55] <dekkitout> *Noted
[2:58:56] <Xelhesia> welcome to Louisiana
[2:58:57] <pyroco101> So does the game have an actual personality now or is it LOLSOWACKY?
[2:58:58] <%deviljhojho94> oh
[2:58:59] <rearedlogarithm> Nurgleville.
[2:59:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> What the fuck is that
[2:59:04] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat What do you think of the game so far? Would you recommend it? It looks really dumb at some parts.
[2:59:08] <$SGrim> @krawtch you are a heartless, agency-less, sociopath, who only feels alive when firing a gun. woopsADD
[2:59:11] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Is there a dog in this game and can you pet it?
[2:59:13] <+Undenizen> @GarbageNirvana but that's the cars fucking each other

[2:59:28] <SomeAsianDood> ehhhhhh
[2:59:30] <T0KK0Knight> Beware of ogres.
[2:59:32] <+WonderLandGhost> @AngriestPat There's an old game from years ago, about having "gay" sex with your car. I forget what it it was called...but it something I remember people being very fascinated with.
[2:59:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd wait for massive drop in price
[2:59:34] <xeros720> hmm, if the shooting is good, maybe
[2:59:35] <metalwater8> Reminds me of the Guardians from BOTW
[2:59:35] <energywarning> sounds about right
[2:59:40] <%rosemon5001> this feels like you got to ignore a lot of the side junk to make it feel harder but if you like doing side junk you can buy anything you see
[2:59:41] <%Deekman> so a regular farcry dlc?
[2:59:44] <rytisone> so new dawn?
[2:59:44] <TwinBat> shouldn't you just get new dawn then?
[2:59:45] <Patzzki217> just lie new dawn
[2:59:46] <gigamercer> Papa Smegma
[2:59:46] <$Mendin> @WonderLandGhost Radiator 2
[2:59:47] <+Champine> far cry doom
[2:59:48] <$hatesdps> so big blood dragon hold the cool
[2:59:49] <+paladinstarbuster> so far cry
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh bad the thing I play games for
[2:59:53] <$CharlesRobinJr> blood dragon

[2:59:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Must buy
[2:59:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I do rather like how the game looks in this swamp area
[2:59:56] <KangarooCyborg> Yeah fallout blooddragon with Doom combat
[2:59:56] <+Noxybaru> So Far Cry but with better shooting
[3:00:00] <+WonderLandGhost> @Mendin lol oh? Interesting
[3:00:01] <+Gespens> So, it's Far Cry lol
[3:00:02] <$MajorCrasher> is the story bad though?
[3:00:02] <+krawtch> i havent played a far cry since blood dragon and im pretty confident i made the right choice
[3:00:04] <+MechaBaphomet> just play new dawn
[3:00:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Blood Dragon is IMMENSELY better than this
[3:00:09] <$MajorCrasher> or just dumb on purpose
[3:00:11] <CurrySauseBandit> @AngriestPat Good advice
[3:00:11] <CrazyGunMan100> imagine mad max and far cry new dawn had a babby
[3:00:11] <Jrockoni> @twinbat he said good shooting
[3:00:17] <+gantz_zero> @CharlesRobinJr being a Blood Dragon is this game's wet dream. they're incomparable
[3:00:17] <%Deekman> if there was ever a case for don't text and drive Pat's making it right now
[3:00:18] <dekkitout> So play it like a Bethesda game
[3:00:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just play Blood Dragon
[3:00:21] <%Remery_> Would ike to buy this game but i have a feeling its going to be on sale two weeks later
[3:00:26] <InsomniacPersona> @AngriestPat did you pay money or were provided a key?
[3:00:28] <+Undenizen> PC gamer says to go off the beaten path plenty.
[3:00:28] <xeros720> blood dragon was a real tight farcry game when most of them are just really bloated
[3:00:31] <@commanderclaw> Also, don't be afraid to coward out of an outpost and come back when you're apatBig
[3:00:32] <+krawtch> lol at least rage 2 isnt days gone
[3:00:33] <starotter70> eh
[3:00:35] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli This
[3:00:45] <+krawtch> really looking forward to days gone being free on PSPlus this november
[3:00:45] <$Mendin> @WonderLandGhost It's free and on steam
[3:00:46] <CrypticMochi> Lot of the dialogue kinda sucks

[3:00:57] <+WonderLandGhost> @Mendin Nice.
[3:01:00] <SomeAsianDood> a buggy nightmare, that's what days gone is
[3:01:05] <+krawtch> days gone is the most nothing game
[3:01:08] <+Undenizen> also to "talk to everyone twice"
[3:01:10] <+Noxybaru> God, Days Gone. It's been a while since I've seen such a big released forgotten literally immediately
[3:01:10] <laguerrilha> The whole map looks like bought generic pre-made assets
[3:01:16] <$Mendin> It actually got banned from Steam back when it first came out but later got back on when they eased up
[3:01:17] <CalderGaming> Kvasir same voice as Volgin from Snake Eater, Eldoth from Baldur's Gate 1, Codex narrator from Mass Effect
[3:01:22] <%Taisuru> Adios
[3:01:25] <TwinBat> lmao
[3:01:27] <+krawtch> those enemy designs are at least cool
[3:01:28] <xeros720> i'm honestly impressed with how much shit is going on with no framerate loss
[3:01:31] <KangarooCyborg> I think you just walked into a tower defense game
[3:01:39] <+Undenizen> some chunks float.
[3:01:39] <%NWR_James> THE CHUMPS

[3:01:59] <+Chopper3k> It's the same place where Kvasir was in the first game
[3:02:04] <+Nomicro4u> Days gone is a solid 7/10
[3:02:16] <CybertronPrime> Good to know, I'll wait until it's like, half off.

[3:02:39] <+krawtch> does anyone else think FF7RE is going to redesign tifa because square doesnt have the huevos to deal with SJW journos ree'ing about titters
[3:02:40] <+gantz_zero> shit i thought it said handcannon not handscanner

[3:05:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just aim the gun and shoot
[3:05:31] <+mmSoTasty> what is that breath effect
[3:05:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Because Directing
[3:05:33] <shattywack> Pretty sure he was in the first game. Just didn't have that abomination attached to him
[3:05:33] <%korth367> shoot it
[3:05:36] <%jiin6> Avalanche and ID
[3:05:36] <CalderGaming> yup, avalanche, with id on tech assistance
[3:05:36] <+krawtch> someone said "solutions" and your gun came out
[3:05:37] <Lulu19> DAD?
[3:05:40] <KangarooCyborg> Is that also the asshole?
[3:05:40] <%ElenaManetta> What is happening around his mouth area?
[3:05:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I do not like his...legs

[3:05:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> lips...moving in time with his own
[3:05:52] <SpaceGuntank> because of the disgusting ass mutant that the camera keeps focusing on
[3:05:58] <+BoomerTiro> This is his alternative to a wheelchair
[3:06:05] <reinbachthe3rd> It's just continuously vomiting. lol
[3:06:09] <%Faustgesicht> that arm just teleported
[3:06:11] <+paladinstarbuster> This is what zero directing looks like
[3:06:14] <Ion_Laser> have you tried overclocking?
[3:06:22] <%jiin6> he's ride is pure Lupus
[3:06:22] <%illicitdonut> illicitdonut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:06:23] <CrypticMochi> Are you the robot, the old man, or the mutant?
[3:06:26] <DevilDeus13> Longer than it took to make this ga,e
[3:06:30] <$ESP_ROOT> wait that voice is familiar
[3:06:31] <+kawachipto> just download more ram Kappa
[3:06:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait...am I wrong to think Yuri
[3:06:33] <$ESP_ROOT> the main characters
[3:06:34] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 18 month streak! 
[3:06:35] <+krawtch> is that mutant just a rejected Doom 3 design
[3:06:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Its this a yuri
[3:06:41] <CalderGaming> it's volgin
[3:06:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Is this a spideyman
[3:06:48] <tyrano_the_wise> is that supose to be puke?
[3:06:49] <+crazzy294> Sam riegel
[3:06:51] <%ThirdWelles> It's Sam Riegel
[3:06:53] <Nina96> oh that yuri
[3:06:53] <californaya> man, this is a lot of dialog
[3:06:57] <T0KK0Knight> Rage 2 confirmed anime
[3:07:10] <waifoong98> Yuri from RE2?
[3:07:11] <+krawtch> i knew that you, the player character, would do the mission
[3:07:12] <%BrazenMask> Are we all just staring at "Legs" and not paying attention to story or is it just me?
[3:07:12] <Pookiedaexzile> "Oh that yuri"
[3:07:13] <Frostydough> wait thats illegal
[3:07:14] <%DedlokPM> @Pookiedaexzile Who? Walker? Nah. Walker is voice by Sam Riegel
[3:07:15] <+Undenizen> @AngriestPat wait for 6 years in game.
[3:07:17] <gigamercer> please never come here again
[3:07:20] <+FoolsArcade> Dig up stupid
[3:07:22] <QaizerArt> no pat you didn't check his lab for stuff
[3:07:23] <waifoong98> RA2*
[3:07:23] <dekkitout> To the realm where capitalism hasn't reached!
[3:07:27] <sirrice77> No legs is just hard not to look at
[3:07:29] <%jiin6> Sam Riegel, played a guy named Yuri
[3:07:29] <+Blackgaver> space?
[3:07:30] <$ESP_ROOT> sam riegel and yuri lowenthal are the same person
[3:07:33] <+paladinstarbuster> SPACE
[3:07:35] <+Blackgaver> the final frontier..
[3:07:36] <T0KK0Knight> Set system clock ahead 6 years
[3:07:36] <+Tarkara> How is it so far?
[3:07:38] <Pallion_> That drool effect made no sense
[3:07:44] <%Faustgesicht> oh shit that is him, was certain that was liam again
[3:07:45] <CalderGaming> @dekkitout i love that tim curry bit so so much
[3:07:45] <+gantz_zero> @sirrice77 i legit stared at it the entire time too....
[3:07:48] <InugamiTheHound> so this recycled/reskin of doom. I bet everyone hate it because gamers hat it when you recycle any game content
[3:07:50] <dekkitout> Right
[3:07:51] <+MechaBaphomet> the whole game is going back and forth between these places
[3:08:03] <Pookiedaexzile> What made no sense is the fact that it didn't breath...what ever it was
[3:08:05] <waifoong98> How is the gun play?
[3:08:06] <deafmutelaughing> want more EPIC LOOT?
[3:08:07] <xeros720> fast travel only works in car, i suppose
[3:08:07] <+krawtch> i stared at the gross thing because it was more interesting than old man in a gimp suit, somehow
[3:08:14] <dekkitout> Wait- were Doc's eye
[3:08:16] <+Blackgaver> these are the voyages of @AngriestPat his 5 year mission,, to explore new life and new civilisation,,, to not boldly go where no man has gone before
[3:08:17] <+mmSoTasty> did they just use the phrase "epic loot" unironically
[3:08:23] <dekkitout> Eyes glowing green?
[3:08:24] <sirrice77> @gantz_zero yeah its kinda unsettling to say the least
[3:08:27] <xeros720> get the night ship down from night
[3:08:29] <+thecho1> I just joined in, does Pat like the game so far?
[3:08:31] <+JaceADisgrace> how's Rage 2
[3:08:34] <gunzerkingdunce> I just want the main character to go I've been waiting for this at some point
[3:08:34] <%jiin6> Shoot space
[3:08:36] <%GarbageNirvana> So there was a writer at Polygon who was upset about that particular character because the mutant half had a cleft palate, which was a birth defect he had
[3:08:40] <KangarooCyborg> What if your girl started every foreplay sesh by saying "Systems activating"?
[3:08:42] <SpaceGuntank> the space pod from spaaaaace
[3:08:42] <Nina96> i expected a lot more loot than ive seen tbh
[3:08:48] <TwinBat> ur eyeball is blessed
[3:08:51] <ScreamingMeat> INFECTED
[3:08:52] <T0KK0Knight> Emlo spores
[3:08:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Oooh its a Donetello
[3:08:57] <%king_wragles> so the game is supposed to look like this?
[3:08:58] <+krawtch> @KangarooCyborg with any luck someday will be like that
[3:08:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hmm
[3:09:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Say Pizza ya bastard
[3:09:04] <%deviljhojho94> Same
[3:09:06] <$ESP_ROOT> its open world?
[3:09:08] <%jiin6> Elmo is molting
[3:09:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> So its an 8?
[3:09:12] <CalderGaming> lol
[3:09:14] <+Blackgaver> elmo used floating hair on pat,,, it was super effective
[3:09:14] <xeros720> that Mad Max game was surprisingly good
[3:09:17] <starotter70> Ok, but when are you gonna stream Spore?
[3:09:19] <%ElenaManetta> Oh, I thought people liked Just Cause
[3:09:19] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:09:20] <%jiin6> yeh Avalanche
[3:09:24] <+gantz_zero> @GarbageNirvana yeah i remember that. really stretching
[3:09:26] <Xiangchang> So are there going to be any big shootouts with Andrew W. K. music blasting? That'd be the best.
[3:09:27] <tyrano_the_wise> seems about right
[3:09:27] <$MajorCrasher> why does the game not deserve it?
[3:09:31] <dekkitout> A strong 6
[3:09:32] <%Taisuru> Solid 7
[3:09:32] <%king_wragles> 6
[3:09:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Lulu19) (warning)
[3:09:32] <$HentaiSenpai9K> What? Just Cause 2 & 3 was awesome
[3:09:32] <Futurecity10> 6/10
[3:09:34] <+Lost_Zombie> It's pat/10
[3:09:34] <%Keyd00d> 3
[3:09:35] <+ktothec99> Good 7's are the best
[3:09:35] <+MechaBaphomet> 6
[3:09:36] <Lulu19> NOT 3 AND 4
[3:09:36] <Pookiedaexzile> its a Avalanche 7
[3:09:37] <Dr_Mooose> ***
[3:09:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> 7
[3:09:38] <+krawtch> JC3 was ok but it had problems with some story missions being buggy
[3:09:38] <%jiin6> 7
[3:09:40] <CalderGaming> just cause 3 was great, just cause 4 had problems
[3:09:41] <SpaceGuntank> sooo a 7.5?
[3:09:41] <$ESP_ROOT> its a 1 then
[3:09:42] <$El_Desperad0> 7 is pretty good
[3:09:42] <Nina96> 7.5?
[3:09:44] <xeros720> a 7 with a bunch of money, a Golden 7 if you will
[3:09:45] <+maybefalco> like a 7.75
[3:09:45] <supahrob64> In terms of the studio, it's a relative 8
[3:09:46] <%ElenaManetta> But seven eight nine
[3:09:46] <+krawtch> JC4 seemed like a nosedive
[3:09:47] <%Remery_> So it's not an insta buy
[3:09:47] <CalderGaming> yeah there was a 4th one i know
[3:09:47] <+Undenizen> 8 out of 12
[3:09:49] <%Nope80808> Its a Fantano Heavy seven
[3:09:54] <Xiangchang> 7.8/10 Too Much Rage
[3:09:54] <%jiin6> it feels like a 6 or 7
[3:09:55] <deafmutelaughing> I get it
[3:09:57] <%thebonebard> 8s tend to make you feel more than just fun
[3:09:59] <cant_pick_a_name> 5/7
[3:10:00] <Pookiedaexzile> You got 7s and Avalanche 7s
[3:10:02] <CrimsonFox777> It's incredibly fun but still has a fair amount of flaws.
[3:10:02] <IntrepidEye> JC 4 felt like a step backwards in many ways
[3:10:03] <HyperBomb21> Is it a broken marriage out of 10?
[3:10:03] <$ESP_ROOT> its a 112 out of 168
[3:10:07] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean the dude's probably sensitive about it since it's something he had to deal with
[3:10:08] <TranquilTurnip> I get you, the quality is 7 but with the added bonus of also being fun
[3:10:09] <Pookiedaexzile> two different 7s
[3:10:10] <waifoong98> D EW IT
[3:10:12] <+redstonej> Pat's fun-o-meter
[3:10:12] <T0KK0Knight> 14/20
[3:10:13] <$MajorCrasher> it sounds like you just don't like the devs
[3:10:13] <shattywack> Mad Max was also a really fun 7
[3:10:13] <KangarooCyborg> What is deadly premonition?
[3:10:15] <+Jordan_z123> A light 7
[3:10:15] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat when's stalker call of pripyat
[3:10:16] <SomeAsianDood> so you're saying it's b movie schlock but good schlock @AngriestPat
[3:10:17] <Lulu19> This team didn't make just cause 3 and 4, just 1 and 2
[3:10:17] <Xelhesia> kinda like Dragon Age Inquisition
[3:10:18] <+ktothec99> it's like a great dumb action movie vs a similar but more forgettable dumb action movie
[3:10:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> King Hotwheelz soon you fucks
[3:10:20] <TranquilTurnip> Fun is independent of quality
[3:10:21] <xeros720> numerical ratings barely make sense with EDF
[3:10:21] <+BroLASco> it's ok to enjoy shitty games
[3:10:23] <FatherGreyBeard> EDF! EDF!
[3:10:23] <Roach_Mc_Goach> Was wondering why gun barrel city sounded so familiar, theres a real town near where i live called that
[3:10:24] <Swish19XX> New games are fun
[3:10:24] <AmericanaRed> The sbfp theory
[3:10:25] <+SuichiTanaka> To Save Our Mother Earth From Any Alien Attack!
[3:10:26] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> so it's a 7 but a fun 7? worth buying or no?
[3:10:27] <MrLittleSam> WHAT
[3:10:28] <DevilDeus13> Triple 7 is a jackpot tho
[3:10:30] <+mmSoTasty> aw i thought the eden space center was in space
[3:10:33] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I think its a 2737272772.23 out of 9373727633663.33
[3:10:33] <xeros720> you need the GamePro CRAZY FACE to do it justice
[3:10:39] <SpaceGuntank> oh hey its the area from the trailer
[3:10:39] <+Undenizen> gotta sleep. good night, beautiful man + cat
[3:10:42] <@Mechz71> you like it cause it shoots the endorphins in the correct part of your brain
[3:10:45] <%Sovspot> BOTW was a boring game that just copied ubisoft open world mechanics
[3:10:48] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Link? it's was a decimal number SMH
[3:10:49] <$El_Desperad0> Breath of the Wild stops being fun after a while, EDF doesn't
[3:10:54] <+NiktenKing> BOTW isn't a good Zelda game... but it is a good open adventure game
[3:10:56] <+Noxybaru> Yeah like I'd rather rewatch Taladega Nights than see Schindler's List right now
[3:10:57] <InugamiTheHound> you don't have any allies to help you?
[3:11:05] <Pookiedaexzile> @HentaiSenpai9K Thats fucking crazy how dare you insult this game that way
[3:11:08] <+krawtch> MGS5 is apparently a 10/10 but id rather play almost any other game than another hour of it
[3:11:09] <%GarbageNirvana> I liked BOTW well enough when I played it
[3:11:11] <DavidMurs> @AngriestPat Hey pat love your shit, watched since kirby and wanted to stop lurking, are there any events you might do in mont
[3:11:11] <Lulu19> lol the botw hot takes. copied ubisoft? what
[3:11:11] <%ElenaManetta> HEE YAHH
[3:11:13] <%thebonebard> @HentaiSenpai9K wouldnt that just be a 3/9
[3:11:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Definitely something that can be built on though
[3:11:17] <CalderGaming> yeah those slow rockets are so slow so easy to dodge yeah
[3:11:18] <californaya> Man, all these hot takes on BotW. I love that game because it's not a typical Zelda game but damn, y'all.
[3:11:20] <%ThirdWelles> I'll be honest. I really don't like Sam for this character.
[3:11:21] <CrypticMochi> 7 seems about right, fun with noticeable problems
[3:11:22] <%jiin6> use med kit
[3:11:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ever heard of SANICBALL?!? That is a 2/10 if you ar generous, but it's got thee fun of a 9/10..... it's basically that
[3:11:25] <$ESP_ROOT> id rather play doom than this honestly :/
[3:11:28] <+NiktenKing> Much like MGS5 isn't a good MGS game, but an amazing action game
[3:11:34] <Pookiedaexzile> We getting some Reviewer grade gameplay
[3:11:35] <Swish19XX> Is this on hard?
[3:11:35] <KangarooCyborg> The shotgun is satisfying to fire but the enemies aren't satisfying to shoot
[3:11:36] <%Keyd00d> these enemies talk a lot
[3:11:43] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> we CoD 5: WaW now
[3:11:44] <CalderGaming> no one was written for or directed well in this game so far
[3:11:46] <+thecho1> to me, BOTW felt weak as a open world game
[3:11:48] <InugamiTheHound> can't you knock them out of the air?
[3:11:51] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah I'm hard-pressed to find a reason to play this over, like, Doom again
[3:11:52] <shattywack> I would say it's worth the money if you have it. Not worth sacrificing something for it though
[3:11:52] <xeros720> don't worry pat, we the stream, can revive you
[3:11:53] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat You have a Dash
[3:11:54] <+krawtch> nice catch
[3:12:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Just went to an 5 outta 10
[3:12:05] <+paladinstarbuster> This game needs music
[3:12:05] <$ESP_ROOT> 20%? PogChamp
[3:12:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Needs Easy mode
[3:12:11] <deafmutelaughing> wait did I miss the defib prompts?
[3:12:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok
[3:12:20] <DavidMurs> Does any one know in chat if there will be any event in mont, i know the super beast will be at rtx, but thats far AF
[3:12:20] <%Remery_> @Keyd00d I guess they are trying to imitate the funny Psychos of Borderlands 1 & 2?
[3:12:21] <%flying_hipp0> how do defrib work?
[3:12:21] <sirrice77> @californaya honestly it just made me want a regular zelda but i haven't played one since wind waker so
[3:12:22] <%DedlokPM> @deafmutelaughing I have no idea
[3:12:25] <dekkitout> Yeah- uh, where's the music?
[3:12:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> no music
[3:12:27] <tyrano_the_wise> this almost feels like hard mode
[3:12:27] <KangarooCyborg> Should just play the Doom soundtrack in the other tab
[3:12:28] <%king_wragles> Why don't they just stop talking?
[3:12:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just heartbeats
[3:12:31] <CalderGaming> don't worry about the defib, we're not even sure what the viewer controls are
[3:12:34] <+gantz_zero> @deafmutelaughing can't miss what isn't there
[3:12:35] <%Faustgesicht> oh hey it's the reveal area
[3:12:36] <%Finakala> Best Zelda game is still Okami
[3:12:43] <Ion_Laser> @deafmutelaughing we get the prompts when he dies a second time
[3:12:46] <$ESP_ROOT> what the deal with your character doing the hand claw thing
[3:12:49] <%Keyd00d> @Remery_ makes sense, don't care for enemies in that game either
[3:12:50] <deafmutelaughing> ah thanks Ion_Laser
[3:12:52] <californaya> Wind Waker's the only other Zelda game I've beaten, lol
[3:12:54] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Finakala you ain't wrong.
[3:12:59] <SpaceGuntank> you have to install the extension on your side too apparently for the defib to show up
[3:13:01] <xeros720> is there some kind of medkit can you eat?
[3:13:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Best zelda game is the New god of War
[3:13:04] <Pallion_> No music. Budget went into pink filters.
[3:13:08] <jessedouglas> @tyrano_the_wise it is on hard mode.
[3:13:13] <sirrice77> @ESP_ROOT he's using a power and that shows he's using it, i think so he can see people through walls
[3:13:14] <+krawtch> if you go thru the 8 step process of linking the extension (that you have to install) with your bethesda account (that allows them to collect data on you, assuredly) then you can maybe do a prompt to give him another 5% health or whatever.
[3:13:14] <+Deano8817> well done
[3:13:18] <big_chugnus> Having played neither this, Borderlands 3 or Far Cry New Dawn I can confidently say i'm already sick of all 3
[3:13:18] <%Niney_Who> did you just get
[3:13:19] <%ThirdWelles> wow
[3:13:26] <ScreamingMeat> Dash button exists
[3:13:26] <%ThirdWelles> That was just about the worst thing I've ever seen
[3:13:27] <%Niney_Who> did she EXPLOSION JUMP you?
[3:13:28] <CalderGaming> the extension is just for the streamer
[3:13:28] <$ESP_ROOT> @sirrice77 ohhh ok
[3:13:32] <+MechaBaphomet> the shotgun doesn't have the same impact that doom odes
[3:13:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat plays games like a terminator with a glitch
[3:13:39] <%Remery_> @Keyd00d they had some pretty funny out therlines that probably won't be in the next borderlands because it might trigger people
[3:13:43] <Pookiedaexzile> No cover just shoot
[3:13:46] <+gantz_zero> @big_chugnus at least they aren't ww2
[3:13:54] <%DedlokPM> @ScreamingMeat BUT WHAT IF HE NEEDS THE DASH LATER! apatGoblin
[3:14:02] <deafmutelaughing> oh you have to install it that's dumb as shit lol
[3:14:03] <big_chugnus> @gantz_zero haha not wrong there
[3:14:09] <DavidMurs> this game looks like the most vidoe game vidoe game ive seen in a while
[3:14:10] <ScreamingMeat> @DedlokPM LUL
[3:14:11] <+Deano8817> also pat where the hells the CUBE
[3:14:12] <%ThirdWelles> On top of the open storage crate
[3:14:15] <sirrice77> @Remery_ but wasnt the guy that was all about social politic and triggering fired?
[3:14:15] <%ThirdWelles> You just saw one
[3:14:21] <coreybom> @big_chugnus wait if you never played them, then how are you sick of this?
[3:14:22] <CalderGaming> NotLikeThis viewers... don't have to install... anything...
[3:14:28] <%Bt_Robot> @AngriestPat keeps forgetting he has double jump.
[3:14:43] <SomeAsianDood> Man I can't wait for the mod that replaces all the voicelines with Teddy's
[3:14:49] <KangarooCyborg> mmm waist high cover
[3:14:51] <+krawtch> you have to install the extension on twitch and link it, yes
[3:15:01] <$Mendin> Airdasher?
[3:15:02] <Pookiedaexzile> This section was built for days guys we had to speed up the clock a little you understand
[3:15:08] <+krawtch> it just sits there as a blank box otherwise
[3:15:08] <%Faustgesicht> Holy shit this is actually the reveal trailer
[3:15:12] <%Remery_> @sirrice77 not sure but games nowadays are so hooked on making a statement for some reason
[3:15:14] <big_chugnus> @coreybom Just the aesthetic
[3:15:20] <AmericanaRed> What a boring voice
[3:15:22] <tank7013> Jesus. Was browsing the Twitch extensions out of curiosity and found one that lets chatters spend bits to timeout each other
[3:15:22] <HellboundHeartless> Wait male Walker is voiced by Sam Riegel!? I gotta try this game now
[3:15:24] <+redstonej> oh no road goons
[3:15:28] <%Faustgesicht> i'm mildly impressed
[3:15:29] <CalderGaming> no you don't, those instructions for linking end with "go back to your creator's menu and start streaming"
[3:15:35] <%Remery_> @sirrice77 wasnt that the claptrap guy?
[3:15:39] <waifoong98> @tank7013 wtf LUL
[3:15:41] <big_chugnus> Anyone else remember being SUPER hyped for Rage 1 and getting like 3 hours in and giving up?
[3:15:45] <+Saltima> he's beatin it
[3:15:49] <Pookiedaexzile> yeah yeah yeah,
[3:15:49] <%ThirdWelles> nice
[3:15:54] <%ThirdWelles> you really punched that pillar good
[3:15:56] <lezzan94> yep
[3:15:56] <CrypticMochi> I would love to see a dialogue mod for this game
[3:15:57] <Louie_Salmon> @tank7013 That sounds great, just turn it into a battle Royale you can literally pay to win
[3:15:58] <californaya> Try to Rage, Try to Hide, Break On Through to the Other Side
[3:15:59] <tank7013> @waifoong98 This feels like a huge mistake
[3:16:03] <Ion_Laser> BiG GIBS
[3:16:03] <$Mendin> Juicy
[3:16:05] <%Finakala> Rage looked dope in the trailers, turns out it was impressively alright at best
[3:16:08] <%jiin6> Pat why do you like rockets to the face so much?
[3:16:09] <deafmutelaughing> shoutout thug 2
[3:16:12] <sirrice77> @Remery_ because the writing is better but not that much better and no the claptrap guy is someone else pretty sure
[3:16:16] <waifoong98> @tank7013 but hey, sounds like a great idea for idiots to waste money LUL
[3:16:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd like to see a complete overhaul of the character designs.
[3:16:21] <InugamiTheHound> its like you have a mini force gun from dead space in your left hand
[3:16:22] <coreybom> @big_chugnus Well, I rather it be colorful then a mix of grey and brown.
[3:16:28] <Pookiedaexzile> this a solid download for 30 bucks
[3:16:31] <+krawtch> ok well it didnt pop up once in the like 9 times he got downed, so it doesnt work. 10/10 S+ rank AAA developed
[3:16:37] <Huntercd> Why is Pat fighting Mad Max rejects?
[3:16:42] <%UnluckyAce> UnluckyAce subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:16:46] <tank7013> @waifoong98 And a great way for Twitch to trick these idiots into buying more bits
[3:16:49] <SomeAsianDood> @Remery_ claptrap actor got attacked by randy pitchford in a hotel lobby allegedly, refuses to work with Gearbox
[3:16:51] <$Mendin> Congratulations Presidnent
[3:16:51] <SomeAsianDood> It's great
[3:16:52] <Louie_Salmon> Because this world is a Mad Max reject
[3:16:53] <dekkitout> Mr. President
[3:16:53] <AmericanaRed> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:16:54] <KangarooCyborg> Never trust anything called Eden
[3:17:00] <waifoong98> @tank7013 heheh
[3:17:07] <%Finakala> Child of Eden was a fun game
[3:17:08] <DevilDeus13> I feel like not being able to shoot chunks out of the enemy was a missed opportunity
[3:17:16] <T0KK0Knight> Sorry if late, but has pat acknowledged the WoD Werewolf game in development?
[3:17:19] <%Taisuru> lol
[3:17:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> heh
[3:17:20] <%salty_syd913> oh
[3:17:23] <californaya> nice
[3:17:23] <%Remery_> @SomeAsianDood oh okay, thank you
[3:17:25] <waifoong98> "fighting" heh
[3:17:25] <%deviljhojho94> LUL
[3:17:30] <+NiktenKing> O-oh...
[3:17:34] <deafmutelaughing> they were just enjoying themselves you monster!
[3:17:42] <Pallion_> party's over
[3:17:43] <+Chopper3k> Where is this game on the Duke Nukem Forever scale?
[3:17:45] <tank7013> Jesus fuck there's a fart button extension
[3:17:54] <+gantz_zero> god damn urban youth
[3:17:55] <+gantz_zero> amirite?
[3:17:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> don't you have grenade tennis?
[3:18:08] <InugamiTheHound> project at eden's gate is from far cry 5
[3:18:12] <+krawtch> is there going to be a perk to unlock glory kills at some point or is this game just not that good
[3:18:14] <Onamar> This game looks extremely 2006
[3:18:18] <californaya> I've been playing a ton of MK11 and I still think these headshot explosion sounds are a bit much
[3:18:24] <%Taisuru> @Chopper3k Knight Nukem / Duke Nukem
[3:18:29] <SomeAsianDood> hmmm
[3:18:31] <+gantz_zero> @Zaphire_Saucypants yeah but pat is over 30, his reflexes aren't what they used to be Kappa
[3:18:31] <%Finakala> Pretty sure DNF has it's own scale with nothing else on it but Aliens: Colonial Marines
[3:18:32] <+paladinstarbuster> double tap
[3:18:35] <HellboundHeartless> Double Tap Pat they calls him
[3:18:36] <DrkJP520> I hope we get a DOOM Eternal release date soon.
[3:18:37] <%Bt_Robot> Always double tap
[3:18:41] <+ccadem> pat I don't feel like going to bed how fix
[3:18:43] <Huntercd> I would love for a new FEAR game
[3:18:53] <Djinnazz> cuz Pat is blind
[3:18:56] <shinichizio> Just showed up, is this game good or badgood
[3:18:59] <waifoong98> @ccadem Drink coffee Kappa
[3:19:07] <+gantz_zero> @ccadem watch longer, get bored, fall asleep
[3:19:08] <starotter70> @Huntercd FE4R
[3:19:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> nice whiff
[3:19:13] <KangarooCyborg> flawless
[3:19:13] <%TheNommad> TheNommad subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! lol
[3:19:17] <%GarbageNirvana> This game is game
[3:19:18] <SpaceGuntank> you know you could probably switch the protagonist with like duke nukem or something and i bet the game would be the exact same
[3:19:18] <+krawtch> ok well they didnt attack you at all, so thats a win
[3:19:26] <HellboundHeartless> Heck yes Huntercd new FEAR would be awesome
[3:19:35] <$nademonkey1100> THE CREAM OF THE CROP
[3:19:43] <lezzan94> dope
[3:19:46] <Ion_Laser> OH YEAH
[3:19:49] <Huntercd> Alma was so creepy and tragic
[3:19:57] <DrkJP520> Are there any other enemies besides gunmen?
[3:19:58] <frozenprince18> @AngriestPat How do you feel like the kinetics of shooting and impacting an enemy is? It kinda looks like there's no real feeling of impact when you shoot something to me
[3:20:00] <InugamiTheHound> oh speaking of fear Monolith want fans to tell MS to get fear trilogy on backwards compatible for xb1
[3:20:13] <T0KK0Knight> Shoot those clothes off
[3:20:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah but what about another no one lives forever
[3:20:22] <KangarooCyborg> just like real life
[3:20:25] <%Taisuru> The melee seems bad
[3:20:26] <+krawtch> FEAR is over though, you already adopted your ghost baby brother/devoured your ghost mom, depending on who got more COOL GUY GAME POINTS
[3:20:30] <a_mad_dragon> you mean like MELEE RANGE?
[3:20:33] <%Finakala> Can we get a Dead Space 3 yet
[3:20:36] <+paladinstarbuster> melee range if you will
[3:20:40] <Kurrisum> Wait, If you needed access how did the baddies get in?
[3:20:42] <+Taglog7> pretty colors
[3:20:45] <CybertronPrime> So far this game is giving me Bulletstorm vibes.
[3:20:47] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I keep forgetting this is on Hard.
[3:20:51] <%Remery_> This is hard mode?
[3:20:55] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[3:20:56] <mesamus> the music kind of reminds me of the first trailer that showed DOOM 2016
[3:20:58] <+paladinstarbuster> what scubs
[3:20:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no this is patrick
[3:20:59] <%Remery_> Most enemies ust look at you and talk
[3:21:00] <InugamiTheHound> point man and Paxton Fettel
[3:21:02] <a_mad_dragon> "oh no i have to be within arms length to punch someone OH NO"
[3:21:04] <+darkapples> yeah pick up that felt right
[3:21:06] <yakuzarick> Patrick "never hit a box first try" Boivin
[3:21:08] <+gantz_zero> how is there so much hairgel in the world for these infinite wasteland punk clones
[3:21:08] <%Finakala> To be fair Hard in Rage 1 wasn't hard
[3:21:10] <+darkapples> all those felt right rocks
[3:21:16] <Thorn14> Why is everything pink
[3:21:19] <+Gogetta159> These difficulties are really odd, Hard really seems like normal instead of the in between Normal and Nightmare
[3:21:24] <xeros720> they did a great job decorating
[3:21:24] <+Taglog7> is this the krusty scrub?
[3:21:25] <%ThirdWelles> This game just gets me excited for DOOM Eternal
[3:21:33] <HellboundHeartless> Thorn14 because Mad Max probably
[3:21:33] <+Chopper3k> I mean it doesn't surprise me that the shooting is good and everything else is meh, I did play the 1st RAGE after all
[3:21:34] <T0KK0Knight> Dev's favorite color
[3:21:36] <big_chugnus> "Ya'll got any more them..uhh colour shooters"
[3:21:38] <waifoong98> @Gogetta159 normal is easy then I suppose?
[3:21:45] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Your super punch removes like all the armor
[3:21:49] <CrazyGunMan100> remember shatter busts armor easy
[3:21:50] <+Gogetta159> Has Pats skill even been tested yet?
[3:21:52] <Thorn14> Overcompensating from Rage 1 being brown and brown
[3:21:56] <+ktothec99> i'm digging the music. Is it Mick Gordon?
[3:21:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> all i remember from Rage 1 was the weird texture streaming glitch
[3:22:00] <+paladinstarbuster> almost like they gave you an armor removal technique
[3:22:01] <CalderGaming> tfw doom eternal isn't running on this engine
[3:22:01] <deafmutelaughing> but I'm the PRESIDENT
[3:22:01] <KangarooCyborg> Baby, Easy, You'll have to try occassionally, Hard
[3:22:05] <%Bt_Robot> @AngriestPat smash strips them of all armor.
[3:22:06] <%TheMorilo> TheMorilo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 2 month streak! oh god
[3:22:08] <SomeAsianDood> DO YOU LIKE NEON?! that's what I feel about the art style
[3:22:10] <tank7013> I wonder how nuts later game gear will get
[3:22:12] <+gantz_zero> @Gogetta159 he did put it on nightmare and then everything was 1 or 2 shotting him
[3:22:16] <Wan6Saber> good hit
[3:22:17] <InugamiTheHound> yeah it seems like everyone spited on "brown" shooter from xbox 360 days.
[3:22:18] <%GarbageNirvana> yo is that a Reboot logo
[3:22:18] <SuperFineButtHairs> AHHHHHHH
[3:22:19] <HellboundHeartless> All I remember from Rage 1 was John Goodman
[3:22:19] <big_chugnus> All I remember from rage 1 was the pistol monocle scope
[3:22:21] <$ESP_ROOT> AHHHH
[3:22:22] <+krawtch> iD showing off their new "pink lighting and interactables" genre
[3:22:24] <%deviljhojho94> !UPTIME
[3:22:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 22m.
[3:22:27] <lessthanhuman_tv> jermaChomp aaaa
[3:22:32] <SuperFineButtHairs> oh my god
[3:22:33] <$nademonkey1100> yea this pink everywhere isnt that much better
[3:22:35] <$ESP_ROOT> jermaChomp eaaah
[3:22:38] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Shatter strips all armor
[3:22:44] <$Mendin> 3d Hotline Miami this isnt
[3:22:47] <%Finakala> I completed Rage and I don't remember any semblance of a story
[3:22:50] <SuperFineButtHairs> this music
[3:22:53] <$Mendin> but on the topic of pink lit shootemups
[3:22:54] <SuperFineButtHairs> SourPls
[3:22:59] <%ThirdWelles> This soundtrack is Ass
[3:23:00] <big_chugnus> "Give it the Fortnite colours guys"
[3:23:01] <$MajorCrasher> too easy huh?
[3:23:02] <+Gogetta159> @gantz_zero Saw that I was wondering when he was gonna tested in Hard but I got my answer here lol
[3:23:07] <+krawtch> this music sure exists.
[3:23:16] <$ESP_ROOT> this just makes me even more excited for doom 2
[3:23:28] <%TheMorilo> Is this game good?
[3:23:30] <InugamiTheHound> I remember gamers loved moderns shooters and by the time COD MW2 came out back in 2011 everyone hated modern shooters (MW2 was 2009)
[3:23:33] <californaya> One of my biggest pet peeves is when FPS's make it harder for you to play the game the closer you are to death :v
[3:23:33] <xeros720> it is pretty cool that when you dash around, the enemies can't keep up
[3:23:35] <big_chugnus> Epilepsy O'Clock
[3:23:36] <BreakTheBarrier> ok now give me this, but Titanfall 3
[3:23:36] <shinichizio> Pink is more exciting than brown but is it hard to code colors?
[3:23:39] <InugamiTheHound> MW3 not MW2
[3:23:39] <%Remery_> that feels so satisfying like the dead space stomp
[3:23:40] <%GarbageNirvana> You know what's a good colorful yet gory action game? Katana Zero
[3:23:41] <%ThirdWelles> @TheMorilo No not really
[3:23:42] <%NovaKnightmare> local government agent goes on drug binge and massacres working class
[3:23:43] <+redstonej> why are the special attacks deadlier than the guns?
[3:23:44] <+krawtch> i mean, the music is there but im definitely not going to be clicking OST videos on youtube later just because they came up
[3:23:48] <SuperFineButtHairs> eeeexcellletn
[3:23:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yaaaay pink
[3:23:50] <$ESP_ROOT> yeah pat. katana zero
[3:23:52] <%jiin6> El Presidete no
[3:23:57] <+ghor7> Why does the UI remind me of bulletstorm
[3:24:01] <%bevyrage> weird
[3:24:05] <coreybom> Wow this chat really isn't liking this game huh
[3:24:05] <SomeAsianDood> Katana 0 is fucking great
[3:24:06] <%bevyrage> sub notification isn't showing up
[3:24:06] <KangarooCyborg> oh god metal wolf chaos
[3:24:07] <SuperFineButtHairs> i like techno
[3:24:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm da mothafuckin President
[3:24:10] <SuperFineButtHairs> so fuck yall
[3:24:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> of these United States.
[3:24:20] <CalderGaming> that was quick
[3:24:22] <SuperFineButtHairs> it aint doom level but its fun
[3:24:25] <%jiin6> president pat? oh we're doomed
[3:24:27] <%ThirdWelles> Hey everybody save the money you might have used on this game for DOOM Eternal
[3:24:28] <starotter70> uh
[3:24:28] <+ktothec99> I dig the music. Not as good as other ID games but it's fine
[3:24:30] <shinichizio> Nailed the landing
[3:24:31] <+gantz_zero> gentle
[3:24:31] <%jiin6> time to run
[3:24:33] <deafmutelaughing> this reminds me of the Dead Space crash scene
[3:24:34] <BreakTheBarrier> monkaS
[3:24:34] <$Valdorick> Nice design guys, you just killed the president.
[3:24:34] <DrkJP520> toasty
[3:24:36] <+Chopper3k> oops
[3:24:36] <%NovaKnightmare> oh god
[3:24:37] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not that I don't like it, it's that it's such a by-the-numbers open world game that they slapped Doom gunplay onto
[3:24:39] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[3:24:40] <lezzan94> cool space stuff ?
[3:24:40] <+krawtch> how are you not immolated.
[3:24:45] <starotter70> Are you sure about that?
[3:24:45] <deafmutelaughing> except it went a lot better
[3:24:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Like if the gunplay's not gonna hold you then nothing about it is
[3:24:51] <%FireStarder> FireStarder subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:24:53] <%jiin6> Shut up robot
[3:24:53] <%NovaKnightmare> ok I thought pat was stuck under the table for a sec
[3:24:54] <dekkitout> The Eco has landed SeriousSloth
[3:24:56] <SuperFineButtHairs> weee
[3:24:56] <tank7013> I thought for sure he was stuck there LUL
[3:24:59] <+Starlight_Gamer> eco 15 a satelite?
[3:25:03] <CalderGaming> i smell a timed defense mission
[3:25:04] <$SGrim> Fun boss time woopsYes
[3:25:05] <T0KK0Knight> Convenient zipline
[3:25:06] <lessthanhuman_tv> there doesn't seem to much wrong with the game but a game like this doesn't really grab me. who needs another fps demon/alien/monster game?
[3:25:06] <+MechaBaphomet> I thought he glitched too
[3:25:08] <xeros720> that was an unrealistically convenient zipline
[3:25:09] <HellboundHeartless> The Holy Trinity of video game presidents. Metal Wolf Chaos, Saints Row 4 and this
[3:25:10] <%Archphronimos> So it's Borderlands with DOOM gunplay? That actually sounds pretty awesome...
[3:25:12] <DrkJP520> you're actually going to space? did that happen in rage1?
[3:25:14] <SomeAsianDood> what wacky new upgrade are you getting
[3:25:17] <InugamiTheHound> IMO dead space 3 wasn't as bad as everyone said it was
[3:25:17] <+Saltima> gee what if something goes wrong
[3:25:19] <+NiktenKing> ah the e3 demo mission
[3:25:20] <+gantz_zero> @krawtch the glass softened the blast
[3:25:22] <+Saltima> that would be crazy
[3:25:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Not really Borderlands though because it's not looty like Borderlands is
[3:25:26] <+Chopper3k> That zipline just happened to be there eh?
[3:25:26] <SuperFineButtHairs> damn thats pretty
[3:25:27] <%Remery_> ooo Neon space sounds fun
[3:25:27] <%flagi64> wait you're the president?
[3:25:32] <%GarbageNirvana> It's more like Doom Far Cry
[3:25:35] <CurrySauseBandit> Does anyone else just want to scream "RICHARRRD!" everytime they hear the robot lady say Mr.President?
[3:25:41] <%ThirdWelles> Put your hand in the nanotrite asshole
[3:25:45] <%NovaKnightmare> why does the doc sound like a villain?
[3:25:46] <+krawtch> @gantz_zero soft-ass glass cushioning your sensitive meat body
[3:25:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you know, from this protag, I'm having trouble getting a read on ANY personality.
[3:26:00] <%Finakala> Dead Space 3 was probably a 6/10, which is an issue when the first two were easily 8-9/10s imo
[3:26:00] <SuperFineButtHairs> this writing is shlock and i love it
[3:26:00] <$SGrim> Time for fun woopsYes
[3:26:02] <Pookiedaexzile> battle Mutants? what is this a video game
[3:26:03] <CalderGaming> it's not his best role
[3:26:03] <+paladinstarbuster> FUUU
[3:26:03] <californaya> he's got sass
[3:26:04] <+gantz_zero> @krawtch exactly. it's science
[3:26:06] <%jiin6> Battle Mutants? PogChamp
[3:26:06] <%deviljhojho94> big boy
[3:26:07] <%NovaKnightmare> aww he looks nervous
[3:26:07] <shinichizio> Presidents have no personality, WAI
[3:26:09] <Djinnazz> Yeah, he's pretty bland
[3:26:10] <+Chopper3k> The Authoritah
[3:26:14] <$Mendin> Revenge of Big Chungus
[3:26:15] <tank7013> *pop*
[3:26:16] <$Valdorick> Look at the protag balls on this man
[3:26:17] <rufus2k2> MC sounds like Woody from Toy Story
[3:26:19] <SuperFineButtHairs> aha
[3:26:20] <+cahv123> Yes, yes he is.
[3:26:22] <%jiin6> big pat mutants
[3:26:25] <%ThirdWelles> Man, they must have given Sam the worst direction for this game
[3:26:25] <CalderGaming> this is the same actor as, for example, Phoenix Wright
[3:26:25] <gigamercer> oh hey it's those things from the first game
[3:26:25] <starotter70> Everything is under control
[3:26:27] <Kurrisum> That is the same one? since it missing it's arm?
[3:26:27] <SuperFineButtHairs> high on robot drugs
[3:26:28] <deafmutelaughing> actually it should be quite a large problem
[3:26:32] <alexandrecau> giant mutie that makes all of da rules

[3:26:40] <Pookiedaexzile> F
[3:26:41] <%ThirdWelles> He's so much more capable of emoting than this but it's SO dry
[3:26:41] <lezzan94> the mutties...!!
[3:26:41] <AmericanaRed> Shouldn’t be a problem 4Head
[3:26:42] <+krawtch> this guy knows hes the player character

[3:26:51] <SpaceGuntank> riPepperonis riPepperonis riPepperonis
[3:26:53] <cero_5> that death animation was not great lol
[3:26:54] <shinichizio> Take cover behind the defense objective, like a true hero
[3:26:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit its a cyclops, Run before he bores the fuck outta you
[3:27:01] <tank7013> It's kind of silly that the cooldown doesn't reset outside of combat
[3:27:04] <Thalchampz> did the shadow in the mountain move at 15 fps?
[3:27:06] <CalderGaming> this is a peter dinklage in Destiny 1 kind of situation
[3:27:10] <powerprotoman> "now i get to be the giant rat" says the mutant that kills pat
[3:27:11] <DevilDeus13> What is this fucking music
[3:27:15] <lessthanhuman_tv> @cero_5 yeah wasn't really a Doom 2016
[3:27:17] <InugamiTheHound> no RPGs lying around

[3:28:20] <RealPT1> this MC is Ky's VA isn't it?
[3:28:28] <%Taisuru> Protip: To defeat the cyber crusher, shoot at it until it dies.
[3:28:31] <starotter70> @RealPT1 Yup
[3:28:31] <AmericanaRed> Indiana jones music
[3:28:40] <LoadingFWANK> all i can hear is Devil Hand

[3:29:04] <SuperFineButtHairs> shot the boob
[3:29:05] <InugamiTheHound> Mr.Clemps must really like this guy's big feet
[3:29:06] <tank7013> Is the Cyber Crusher just a Dragon's Dogma golem?
[3:29:06] <$SGrim> I see. Proceeds to shot invincible part. woopsKek
[3:29:08] <%ThirdWelles> The music's real bad

[3:29:11] <+redstonej> he farts fire
[3:29:22] <Xelhesia> shoot his blue chest
[3:29:26] <+krawtch> you can damage him
[3:29:28] <RealPT1> I forget his name but he does have that kinda of no-nonsense snarkiness to his voice
[3:29:28] <%Remery_> force push his balls
[3:29:34] <%Finakala> WEAK POINT
[3:29:40] <SomeAsianDood> exciti.... ResidentSleeper
[3:29:42] <CalderGaming> sam riegel
[3:29:43] <dekkitout> Oh- he's a videogame boss...
[3:29:43] <Zathas> Honestly, this seems alright for "Generic Falvour of the Year Shooter". Each year has at least one.
[3:29:46] <$SGrim> Quick find woopsYes
[3:29:49] <frozenprince18> rooDab
[3:29:51] <waifoong98> Now I am just reminded that BL2 music is pretty good thanks to this fucking nothing track
[3:29:51] <shinichizio> Fantastic, what an impactful battle
[3:29:53] <AmericanaRed> Im having so much fu ResidentSleeper
[3:29:54] <+KrippSubBot> This gameplay does legit look really fun
[3:29:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> This game looks uh....
[3:30:00] <SpaceGuntank> hit the weak point for Massive Damage!
[3:30:01] <CalderGaming> use the slugs pat
[3:30:05] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat pro-tip, slug fire those. woops7
[3:30:09] <demegodz> Big dodged
[3:30:09] <tank7013> The design is neat but nothing it does is
[3:30:20] <KingOfTheGeats> seems more fun to play then watch
[3:30:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Das a big Cyclops, how many Jeans would it take for him to forget about over a Blonde bitch
[3:30:27] <%jiin6> shoot his blue spot, then shoot his blue cylanders
[3:30:29] <SuperFineButtHairs> jesus christ this chat is whiny
[3:30:30] <CalderGaming> at least he's dodging well
[3:30:30] <RealPT1> this kinda looks like the best version of far cry's design
[3:30:37] <CalderGaming> NotLikeThis
[3:30:38] <$RaikenTB> Well it's better than all of the other crap Bethesda put out after Doom.
[3:30:40] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:30:44] <%ThirdWelles> Shoot him in the blue, you fool
[3:30:45] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:30:46] <+krawtch> at the very least, this has answered all the questions i had about RAGE 2
[3:30:47] <lessthanhuman_tv> this doesn't seem bad for 30 dollars
[3:30:47] <%AncelDeLambert> f
[3:30:48] <RealPT1> a checklist map but with actually game play
[3:30:52] <coreybom> Damn I was right, this chat really isn't feeling this game.
[3:30:59] <AmericanaRed> Shouldn’t be that hard 4Head
[3:31:01] <CrypticMochi> He needs some more moves
[3:31:06] <SuperFineButtHairs> you did it
[3:31:06] <Kurrisum> I hope reload speed is a thing eventually
[3:31:07] <KangarooCyborg> Music gave up
[3:31:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Did the music just stop out of nowhere
[3:31:08] <+krawtch> @ABCervidae what if i told you the deluxe edition of this game is $110
[3:31:08] <%Typhaeon> Nice soundtrack 4Head
[3:31:08] <mesamus> its difficult to be serious towards the guys complaining about the gmae cause you all sound you are just on the hate bethesda bandwagon (even though they didn't make this)
[3:31:09] <BreakTheBarrier> jobs gone
[3:31:10] <shinichizio> Musician went home
[3:31:11] <%Faustgesicht> hey music stopped
[3:31:11] <$Valdorick> Sound is deafened
[3:31:12] <KangarooCyborg> defib gltich
[3:31:13] <$RaikenTB> I'd pay like 20-30 bucks for this.
[3:31:13] <%jiin6> are you feeling what?
[3:31:13] <%salty_syd913> perfect
[3:31:14] <+paladinstarbuster> WOW
[3:31:16] <+gantz_zero> yeah the game is like "this isn't epic anymore"
[3:31:16] <demegodz> Music like nah
[3:31:18] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat no, slugs woopsADD
[3:31:19] <Pookiedaexzile> you have a super dash?
[3:31:21] <%Taisuru> RIP Music
[3:31:21] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL big glitch
[3:31:22] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I've noticed it does that when you're so low on health things get muffled
[3:31:22] <AmericanaRed> Rage 76
[3:31:24] <+thecho1> music is now an epic exclusive
[3:31:27] <+redstonej> even the music is done with this game lol
[3:31:28] <tank7013> @coreybom This definitely strikes me as something better for playing than watching
[3:31:31] <+krawtch> the music just hinted that you should have been done this fight by now
[3:31:32] <Zathas> "We didn 't think it'd take this long too kill the boss. Like, wow dude."
[3:31:32] <KangarooCyborg> Oh good more
[3:31:32] <SpaceGuntank> someone forgot to put the track on loop
[3:31:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Okay now kill him for real tho
[3:31:37] <%AncelDeLambert> nooooo, not my Bane juice!
[3:31:37] <demegodz> Pog
[3:31:40] <+BoomerTiro> This thing has health bars in formation to protect his health bars
[3:31:43] <T0KK0Knight> Time for more schut
[3:31:44] <demegodz> Oh wait
[3:31:47] <demegodz> not dead
[3:31:47] <%ThirdWelles> @mesamus I mean it's objectively not good in a lot of areas.
[3:31:49] <%Typhaeon> At least give him a new attack if you're going to make this a two/three phase fight
[3:31:49] <SuperFineButtHairs> yay
[3:31:51] <+paladinstarbuster> TERRIBLE
[3:31:52] <%SneakyCorpse> EZ Clap
[3:31:54] <+Starlight_Gamer> combat seems too easy
[3:31:54] <+maybefalco> yeyeye
[3:31:55] <+NoGoodAtGames> shoot the cyber demon until it dies
[3:31:55] <%deviljhojho94> oh fuck

[3:31:59] <demegodz> Jesus
[3:31:59] <mesamus> @ThirdWelles it is
[3:31:59] <+gantz_zero> that was meh
[3:32:00] <waifoong98> Man this main guy is bland LUL
[3:32:02] <Huntercd> I didn't notice the health bar
[3:32:03] <+Terrarp> this doesn't look fun...
[3:32:04] <CalderGaming> spent a lot of ammo on Not The Weakpoint
[3:32:06] <AmericanaRed> 4Head you good to go
[3:32:06] <SomeAsianDood> hmm
[3:32:08] <%jiin6> pop goes his head
[3:32:11] <KangarooCyborg> Clip into those rocks
[3:32:12] <%Typhaeon> The Cyberdemon fight WORKS in phases because it's DIFFERENT
[3:32:13] <NanayaPeng> First try, boys!
[3:32:14] <%Finakala> Wellsprings was in the first game wasn't it?
[3:32:14] <%AncelDeLambert> this game seems very bland, yes
[3:32:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> apatMenace sbfpSweetbaby apatMenace sbfpSweetbaby apatMenace sipsipHonk apatBlep
[3:32:18] <SpaceGuntank> A U G M E N T E D
[3:32:21] <@commanderclaw> Permanent HP, Overdrive, and Damage upgrades
[3:32:26] <+krawtch> i used to think the player character from Dying Light was generic sounding
[3:32:29] <dekkitout> YEAH, science!
[3:32:29] <EASrake> He'll make you new legs
[3:32:30] <gkingsausagelink> the main characters voice is kinda annoying
[3:32:32] <WeebFever> s c i e n t i f i c a l
[3:32:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I trust this science man, don't you?
[3:32:38] <Djinnazz> lame
[3:32:39] <+Blucarot> Hows the game so far?
[3:32:39] <deafmutelaughing> like SIDEQUESTS!
[3:32:48] <+krawtch> Crane seems like a bastion of personality and emotional range compared to RAGE BOI
[3:32:53] <NickHatesSnow> Eat science become power
[3:32:53] <AmericanaRed> voice actor = ResidentSleeper
[3:32:54] <lezzan94> boring?
[3:32:56] <CalderGaming> voice directing makes a big difference. this game's is poor
[3:33:10] <Nina96> i fell asleep LUL
[3:33:23] <T0KK0Knight> He was a big guy.
[3:33:25] <%Finakala> You did spend half the fight shooting at the wrong bits
[3:33:25] <$nademonkey1100> by not shooting the weak point
[3:33:26] <+krawtch> the boss was big tho
[3:33:28] <%Niney_Who> you weren't shooting him right
[3:33:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Well you are on hard
[3:33:29] <%deviljhojho94> UUUU
[3:33:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Numbers go up
[3:33:32] <DKDiamantes> He was a chonker alright
[3:33:35] <rufus2k2> wonder if the female VA is better?
[3:33:42] <Xelhesia> yup
[3:33:45] <Kurrisum> you spent 1/2 learning where to shoot
[3:33:45] <%Niney_Who> You had to shoot his Blue Chest bit
[3:33:46] <mesamus> upgrades make the battle on the future way quicker
[3:33:48] <+MechaBaphomet> This game seems like it should have glory kills, but it doesnt.
[3:33:49] <+krawtch> glowing weak spots
[3:33:50] <SuperFineButtHairs> oh pat
[3:33:51] <NickHatesSnow> I take this voice direction over 3 lines of Rhonda
[3:33:52] <$nademonkey1100> the BRIGHT blue thing
[3:33:57] <%Typhaeon> Ronda is ear cancer
[3:34:00] <DevilDeus13> This game is destined for the bargain bin
[3:34:00] <%Laecerelius> The glowing weak spot that had a health bar under it
[3:34:01] <%jiin6> the glowy stuff yes
[3:34:05] <%ThirdWelles> @angriestpat Yeah you shoot the blue on his chest. The big glowing video game thing.
[3:34:06] <%logoth_> Use the truck whistle to summon truck
[3:34:08] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! I'm very very tired.
[3:34:08] <T0KK0Knight> Summon the batmobile.
[3:34:09] <CalderGaming> tbf the cannon was also bright and glowing, but...
[3:34:11] <%deviljhojho94> The Big Nothing
[3:34:13] <dekkitout> Can't you conjure Truck-chan
[3:34:13] <@commanderclaw> Get the crate detector, it's a sanity saver
[3:34:14] <BreakTheBarrier> sorry nothing
[3:34:14] <SuperFineButtHairs> a big room
[3:34:18] <AmericanaRed> Catch a riiiiiiiide
[3:34:19] <Pookiedaexzile> No you shoot the meat part, the Meat is where the blood goo is
[3:34:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah this dude's VA is just whatever, Ronda's is actually offensive
[3:34:20] <EASrake> Nope sorry nothing
[3:34:22] <xeros720> someone worked really hard on that ruined office
[3:34:23] <%jiin6> why nothing
[3:34:23] <+krawtch> that was a room of aggressive nothing
[3:34:25] <CalderGaming> oh yeah no lol
[3:34:35] <+MechaBaphomet> cirPalm
[3:34:35] <+maybefalco> looks like a room that an easter egg would be hidden in
[3:34:37] <%BrazenMask> nope glowy bits
[3:34:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah but gray health bar didn't go down...sooo kinda clued me in
[3:34:38] <T0KK0Knight> His flesh is reinforced by SCIENCE.
[3:34:39] <%Typhaeon> To be fair the glowy tech bits do not look vulnerable, being made of hard metals
[3:34:39] <+krawtch> they tried really hard to put nothing in that room and nailed it
[3:34:40] <+paladinstarbuster> Attack glowing weakspot for MASSIVE DAMAGE
[3:34:42] <+AHentaiAddict> hows the game so far? i heard the combats pretty good but everything else isnt that great
[3:34:43] <Flunkorg> I don't even remember who Ronda is.
[3:34:43] <DrkJP520> No, shoot the metallic parts, idiot
[3:34:45] <%Laecerelius> No, that's real life thinking Pat. You need to videogame think. Shoot glow.
[3:34:47] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:34:47] <%ThirdWelles> Man, I've turned around on this game. It looked fun for like 20 minutes, but now I just want DOOM Eternal because it will be so much better
[3:34:50] <%NWR_James> damn
[3:34:51] <KangarooCyborg> What if red dead had an AR with holo sights?
[3:34:52] <tank7013> Well they HAVE been throwing enemies that were weak under armor so I can see how you'd go there
[3:34:55] <%ThirdWelles> this is ass
[3:34:58] <lezzan94> you'd think that, right?
[3:34:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Like I guess it succeeds at making me want to punch Sonya Blade in the fucking face, which is good for a fighting game???
[3:35:02] <rekinom> KKona
[3:35:04] <%Remery_> Now call me dirt
[3:35:07] <%Finakala> The original Rage went cheap real fast, so this probably will too
[3:35:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh hey
[3:35:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> music
[3:35:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the oppisite of real life, where shooting the glowy bit blows up everyone, and the fleshy bit is the highest damage
[3:35:22] <+gantz_zero> wait do the blue explosions even do damage
[3:35:26] <+gantz_zero> i don't think it did
[3:35:28] <Cheekynandos689> yeah thisll be 30$ in 3 months
[3:35:39] <prime_name> How is it so far?
[3:35:41] <lezzan94> this is sounds, not music..
[3:35:43] <%rosemon5001> you can unlock better finder level if im not mistaken
[3:35:47] <%ThirdWelles> Even then it won't be worth it
[3:35:48] <%jiin6> pat ignored the bars
[3:35:53] <xeros720> looking forward to the end of the game where you're dashing all over the place
[3:35:54] <InugamiTheHound> far cry new dawn is $20
[3:35:55] <KangarooCyborg> New vegas music
[3:35:58] <+krawtch> this might be on PSPlus next year
[3:36:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> man, I was thinking I'd give this a shot after it takes a massive price drop but now I'm thinking I won't waste my time even then.
[3:36:03] <%jiin6> blue things explode life
[3:36:03] <@commanderclaw> I associate that kind of music with Spongebob
[3:36:04] <+paladinstarbuster> Real spongebob-y in here
[3:36:08] <+joey_jrpg> yeah im just gonna wait for price to go down tbh
[3:36:10] <%Finakala> Far Cry seems to drop in price a lot from what I've seen
[3:36:13] <AmericanaRed> BlessRNG release cyberpunk 77
[3:36:17] <CrazyGunMan100> the explosions do damage, the feltrite you get from them heals you
[3:36:19] <%Finakala> You can get most of them for practically nothing now
[3:36:22] <Pookiedaexzile> They fucked up
[3:36:23] <coreybom> I'm heading to woolies chat, this chat is kinda insufferable.
[3:36:26] <+gantz_zero> .....i would actually love this on ps+ when you put it in that context @krawtch

[3:36:28] <%Laecerelius> scour this shit, Pat!
[3:36:29] <prime_name> Oh no this looks bad.

[3:36:42] <%GarbageNirvana> That shit drives me nuts
[3:36:44] <+BishopBain> Hey Pat how is the game so far?

[3:38:33] <AmericanaRed> This game doesnt have a billion guns PunOko
[3:38:42] <+MechaBaphomet> Did rage 1 even sell good?
[3:38:44] <+krawtch> yeah but did RAGE 1 have PINK LIGHTS
[3:38:45] <%Remery_> Another one to the "Show Feet" Army
[3:38:45] <%Finakala> No
[3:38:45] <+gantz_zero> it has like 8 @AmericanaRed
[3:38:49] <waifoong98> @AmericanaRed well this is no Borderlands
[3:38:51] <%Laecerelius> yeah you got one that was at the bottom of the stairwell
[3:38:52] <%PopulousNix> goodnight yall
[3:38:52] <%jiin6> Pink means your close
[3:38:52] <$Cobra743> cheer200 hey Pat, so i just spent my last 2 paychecks paying off my credit card, and on top of that i have to make payments on my new car i bought last month, long story short being some 1,600 usd in the hole sucks, so please take this small bit of my money and entertain me you glorious ginger fuck
[3:39:01] <starotter70> @PopulousNix Night
[3:39:02] <$TheBlackMandalorian> Hey is it good or bad
[3:39:04] <xeros720> i bet there's a datapad on the wall or something
[3:39:07] <Xelhesia> night
[3:39:08] <haveswordmuststing> @remery_ forced into the foot licker army but yes
[3:39:08] <%rosemon5001> it probably means the roof ones
[3:39:20] <+TastySammiches> vinePiss
[3:39:28] <T0KK0Knight> no time to mourn
[3:39:29] <SomeAsianDood> they just wanted to paint PepeHands
[3:39:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Didn't you just kill those guys
[3:39:32] <+krawtch> why have i seen you walk down the same hallway with the same enemies at the end of it, doing the same not paying attention to you coming thing
[3:39:37] <%Finakala> Hmm, more weapons would make this even better
[3:39:45] <+joey_jrpg> theres no flashlight? lol
[3:39:47] <%Laecerelius> flashlights are very useful, aren't they?
[3:39:47] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> pink lights might just be pink lights
[3:39:50] <smallboops> WAIT RAGE 2 IS OUT?
[3:39:52] <xeros720> i really hope it isn't bugged
[3:39:55] <DrkJP520> shoot gun to produce light
[3:39:56] <+gantz_zero> Game Design.txt
[3:40:03] <+gantz_zero> didn't meant for that to be a link
[3:40:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> of course, the flashlight might also be pink.
[3:40:08] <+krawtch> you literally just did that hallway earlier with enemies at the end, when you cooked the grenade too much and it blew up before it got to them.
[3:40:11] <DevilDeus13> The BFG edition will include flashlight
[3:40:25] <tank7013> @TheBlackMandalorian The verdict so far seems to be relatively alright game that plays really well.
[3:40:32] <%logoth_> use ammo to get ammo from crates
[3:40:36] <+TastySammiches> the high contrast lighting seems a bit intense
[3:40:47] <T0KK0Knight> Are these guys full of grapejuice?
[3:40:51] <+botchamaniac> Why are there so many purple lights in the apocalypse
[3:40:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder what Ray Navarez thinks of it, I'll have to catch up on his vods
[3:40:58] <+angelmorphic> Is it true this game sucks? Just got here.
[3:40:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Giving the BFG a flash light is Like Giving Brue Lee glasses
[3:40:59] <DrkJP520> god of war 4 had a collectibles bug aswell. sucks shit
[3:41:01] <%Nobrev> you can just melee the crates too
[3:41:06] <EASrake> Nwaaa vineM8
[3:41:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Why make him more accurate and deadly
[3:41:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> but what about the killin', Pat?
[3:41:16] <%logoth_> WAT
[3:41:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> what about...the killin?
[3:41:17] <%Typhaeon> LuL
[3:41:18] <EASrake> LUL
[3:41:19] <+krawtch> ns
[3:41:19] <Rionxgarland> @AngriestPat can confirm opened a crate and the meter vanished
[3:41:20] <+gantz_zero> man the wingstick is OP
[3:41:22] <waifoong98> @botchamaniac "hurdur futuristic cyber punk neon" blablabla, that sort of crap
[3:41:24] <AmericanaRed> OWL2019DVa OWL2019200iq
[3:41:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Boop
[3:41:25] <shinichizio> I thought that would fucking explode when it hit you
[3:41:26] <$Mendin> Gubbinz? ORKZ
[3:41:31] <%Laecerelius> First try!
[3:41:33] <demegodz> Is this just Tara Strong??
[3:41:38] <Soliloquy123> "Haha hey aren't borderlands psychos wacky"
[3:41:42] <T0KK0Knight> Sorry, not sorry
[3:41:45] <+BishopBain> To pieces you say?
[3:41:52] <%jiin6> turned him into paste
[3:41:57] <Pookiedaexzile> I am the big Rat and I make all of da rules
[3:41:58] <pswayde> To shreds, you say?
[3:41:58] <+krawtch> piiiink
[3:42:00] <%Remery_> ooo you can be BoomerangMan :)
[3:42:01] <D3rrtyD4n> and his wife?
[3:42:07] <+gantz_zero> this game makes me like the borderlands psychos a lore more
[3:42:11] <+MechaBaphomet> man this Apocalypse sure is wacky Haha
[3:42:13] <+gantz_zero> you don't know what you've got till it's gone
[3:42:14] <KangarooCyborg> Pat trying to summon crazy talk to his advantage
[3:42:16] <%GarbageNirvana> That Krull glaive thing is neat
[3:42:19] <+krawtch> who needs flashlights just follow the pink
[3:42:21] <%Laecerelius> maybe they're lurking in the infinite darkness
[3:42:25] <tank7013> So much pink
[3:42:42] <$Mendin> I dig the "Post-Apocalyptic Discotheque" aesthetic
[3:42:44] <tank7013> Better than brown and grey I guess
[3:42:47] <T0KK0Knight> That was a lot of bills for $250
[3:42:54] <GUNxSPECTRE> Is this a Fallout 76?
[3:43:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nothing but this pink light for me to groove in.
[3:43:03] <+krawtch> $25,000 or $255, who can say for sure in this crazy post-punkapocalypse?
[3:43:04] <waifoong98> @GUNxSPECTRE no it is FO77 Kappa
[3:43:04] <DraxTD> rage 2
[3:43:10] <%Finakala> I wish we could get a Bulletstorm 2
[3:43:13] <T0KK0Knight> 1c notes.
[3:43:13] <DrkJP520> you already killed people in that area
[3:43:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah the color design in this game is very "We made this one colorful because people complained the last one wasn't"
[3:43:21] <+thecho1> theres like barely any color in this game
[3:43:21] <%rosemon5001> after seeing about 2 streamers also play this i feel like you are overthinking datapad locations
[3:43:28] <%GarbageNirvana> No method behind the madness
[3:43:31] <T0KK0Knight> We PRINT our pennies.
[3:43:44] <+gantz_zero> congratulations it's Fucking Nothing
[3:43:48] <GUNxSPECTRE> @waifoong98 Wow, FO77 looks fucking awesome
[3:43:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> green is also good
[3:43:53] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:43:54] <%Laecerelius> the green monitor. of course
[3:43:57] <%Keeble24> reminds me so much of borderlands/bioshock/farcry
[3:43:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd like to see more green, plz.
[3:44:11] <+TastySammiches> it feels weird to play post-apocalypse madmax psychos straight when borderlands has been riffing on them for the past 10 years
[3:44:13] <+krawtch> follow the skyrim radar
[3:44:18] <Pookiedaexzile> @T0KK0Knight I read that wrong as hell from a glance....you shouldn't print dicks at work man come on
[3:44:19] <%jiin6> right
[3:44:42] <tank7013> Watch it be behind some tiny grate in a dark corner
[3:44:43] <GUNxSPECTRE> I'm for all opportunity extremities printing
[3:44:51] <%rosemon5001> maybe roof or outside
[3:44:51] <GUNxSPECTRE> Gimme dicks, butts, and vagoon
[3:44:54] <%korth367> dig up
[3:44:55] <KiraKamixephos> It has to
[3:44:58] <shinichizio> Good ol' gunshot flashlight
[3:45:05] <%NovaKnightmare> I dont understand
[3:45:07] <pochiyeah> playing fps on a pc with a controller, now thats hardcore
[3:45:07] <+gantz_zero> that's what she said?
[3:45:09] <@commanderclaw> Did he get the one in the outdoor 3rd floor?
[3:45:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Crazy talk is an involuntary stand, you can't game it
[3:45:15] <+krawtch> this radar is tracking everything and shows the distance to whatever you are looking towards, but doesnt show you how to get anywhere
[3:45:17] <GUNxSPECTRE> Why does that gun have so many pretty lights on it
[3:45:19] <%HyperCharge_Sam> o wow!!!!!
[3:45:19] <%Laecerelius> I tend to have to use my Amprex as a flashlight in those shitty Eris infested tilesets
[3:45:21] <$MajorCrasher> to be fair, Pat is pretty blind without a guide
[3:45:22] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Now I'm starting to wonder, lore wise, why the fuck these lights are pink to begin with.
[3:45:27] <%salty_syd913> LUL
[3:45:28] <%RobotPancake> Chat why is he shooting things like he's playing prop hunt?
[3:45:28] <@commanderclaw> apatBig bugs
[3:45:29] <+maybefalco> is there not a button for a flashlight?
[3:45:29] <D3rrtyD4n> wtf
[3:45:31] <Rafikator> how is rage 2 pat first time seeing gameplay
[3:45:32] <+gantz_zero> photo mode @AngriestPat
[3:45:32] <%Nobrev> maybe up your brightness this seems absurdly dark
[3:45:32] <+TastySammiches> DARKNESS
[3:45:33] <+krawtch> hey we didnt make a lightmap for this area. please enjoy our game.
[3:45:33] <Djinnazz> CHEATS
[3:45:36] <%jiin6> hahah
[3:45:36] <+Cityscape17> hey there guys
[3:45:36] <GUNxSPECTRE> Day 1 Patch?
[3:45:37] <Xelhesia> now...thats just black
[3:45:44] <person181> it's fine pat they didn't put in the graphics yet
[3:45:45] <D3rrtyD4n> gamma goes up
[3:45:47] <KiraKamixephos> Brightness go up
[3:45:48] <GypsySquid> Bump up that gamma I guess?
[3:45:49] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:45:49] <SomeAsianDood> hmmm
[3:45:50] <%shadowace2400> no flashlight
[3:45:51] <prime_name> Patch in Flashlight?
[3:45:51] <GUNxSPECTRE> Darker than a dead babby joke
[3:45:56] <KangarooCyborg> Maybe chat integration activates the flashlight
[3:45:58] <+krawtch> we forgot the pink in this room. this was supposed to be the room with all the pink
[3:45:58] <+Fyre_link> is there really no flashlight?
[3:45:59] <Pookiedaexzile> That's Blacker than Randy Pitchfords soul
[3:46:03] <pochiyeah> flashlight is dlc, 30 dollars
[3:46:03] <HumanGiant13> Straight up cant see shit
[3:46:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta turn your Riddick eyes on, man.
[3:46:05] <Rionxgarland> @AngriestPat if you go into photo mode you can change time of day
[3:46:06] <DevilDeus13> Perfect setup for a jumpscare
[3:46:06] <starotter70> Where is everything? sipsipSipsipblind
[3:46:07] <DrkJP520> maybe you can unlock nightvision
[3:46:07] <dekkitout> Anyone on console have this issue?
[3:46:08] <Rafikator> @AngriestPat how is rage 2 pat first time seeing gameplay
[3:46:09] <+DingusMcFadden> So i heard this game has a dating sim mini-game. Any confirmation chat?
[3:46:09] <%logoth_> [ Bugged ]
[3:46:10] <KiraKamixephos> !flashlight
[3:46:13] <laguerrilha> Doom 3 flashlight problem in 2019......
[3:46:14] <+TastySammiches> this looks bugged
[3:46:16] <GypsySquid> Advanced Darkness
[3:46:17] <+krawtch> welcome to the void
[3:46:17] <prime_name> This is silly
[3:46:17] <%NovaKnightmare> IT JUST WORKS
[3:46:17] <+Galactic0ne> buggy buggy
[3:46:18] <shinichizio> Darkness. Imprisoning me. Et cetera.
[3:46:19] <%GarbageNirvana> We've entered the void
[3:46:22] <Rotharn> Is F bound to flashlight or pay respects?
[3:46:24] <waifoong98> Flashlight problems? Sounds like Warframe in a nutshell LUL
[3:46:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> This new Doom looks wesome
[3:46:24] <Pookiedaexzile> That's blacker than the magic Paige uses to pull up her hooker boots
[3:46:24] <+TastySammiches> maybe update your graphics drivers?
[3:46:25] <+krawtch> b e t h e s d a
[3:46:26] <+torontototoro> Bugthesda!
[3:46:26] <%Finakala> This reminds me of that one room in RE2 during release that just straight up had no light for some reason
[3:46:27] <+daisyyyy> Twitch is telling me Pat has 0 viewers, which seems about right Kappa
[3:46:27] <seycheles> fuckin patters
[3:46:27] <%MagickBurritoh> The jank has taken over
[3:46:27] <%jiin6> think its a bug
[3:46:28] <haveswordmuststing> we need more Todd Rays
[3:46:28] <+paladinstarbuster> big spook
[3:46:29] <xeros720> and we're back here again
[3:46:29] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat I saw the defib prompt work properly just now on another stream. a second 4-circle prompt comes up for the viewer that says "Revive the player!" inside. do you have to upgrade your defib in-game or something?
[3:46:31] <+Cityscape17> woo! another busted ass game
[3:46:33] <%logoth_> relaunch the game?
[3:46:33] <Rionxgarland> you can change time of day in photo mode
[3:46:36] <D3rrtyD4n> reload?
[3:46:36] <SpaceGuntank> paige's blindness has spread to pat!
[3:46:38] <@commanderclaw> Save and reload?
[3:46:44] <%AncelDeLambert> this game be buggy as shit
[3:46:48] <Pookiedaexzile> That's blacker than Woolie ins't
[3:46:52] <%Bt_Robot> this seems like a big bug.
[3:46:53] <prime_name> How does that work?
[3:46:56] <+gantz_zero> if not try photomode
[3:46:58] <%NWR_James> big busted?
[3:46:59] <+Cityscape17> this game is more busted than skyrim
[3:47:00] <Rafikator> @AngriestPat how is rage 2 pat first time seeing gameplay
[3:47:01] <InugamiTheHound> big bug for big game
[3:47:02] <GUNxSPECTRE> Advanced Suit doesn't have a built-in torch?
[3:47:02] <DrkJP520> Well, if it's totally dark, there's probably nothing there. unless it's a bug
[3:47:05] <%Finakala> It's black enough for Woolie to trade it for a Jetpack
[3:47:09] <T0KK0Knight> You expect the game to WORK?
[3:47:09] <lezzan94> bugs in a Bethesda game..?
[3:47:11] <+krawtch> no game is as busted as skyrim
[3:47:11] <shinichizio> And now the radar is straight gone
[3:47:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Never buy day one
[3:47:12] <KangarooCyborg> Bethesda's logo should just be a big roach
[3:47:14] <xeros720> oh good, that seems to have fixed that
[3:47:14] <TheRageofAfrica> I join in to see that Pat broke the game
[3:47:14] <+maybefalco> it totally did bug out
[3:47:20] <%HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[3:47:22] <pochiyeah> its a graphic bug 100%
[3:47:29] <@commanderclaw> Thank fuck Pat's having issues, I thought my GPU was dying
[3:47:30] <+gantz_zero> that dude grenaded himself
[3:47:32] <GUNxSPECTRE> Advanced Suit doesn't have night vision?
[3:47:39] <KangarooCyborg> Did it get darker?
[3:47:40] <Djinnazz> lights are breaking
[3:47:41] <haveswordmuststing> its a feature
[3:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> " I can't see shit"
[3:47:46] <Xelhesia> here comes da real black ops
[3:47:48] <%rosemon5001> maybe there is something on the roof if you use the rubble to climb
[3:47:48] <+BoomerTiro> Interesting beta. So when does this game fully launch?
[3:47:52] <InugamiTheHound> no flashlight?
[3:47:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> is a flashlight something you're gonna have to get at an Arc?
[3:47:54] <+DingusMcFadden> Is that gun from Gears of War or Bullet Storm? I can't tell
[3:47:54] <%Typhaeon> The respawns are out of control
[3:47:55] <Kurrisum> well if you need to farm you know you can just reload
[3:47:57] <T0KK0Knight> Shooting in the MIDDLE.
[3:47:57] <%GarbageNirvana> There they are again
[3:48:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Game over man Game over
[3:48:15] <%Laecerelius> This ark shall give you the magic power of LIGHT!
[3:48:16] <+gantz_zero> what a good video game
[3:48:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> leave this place, and never look back.
[3:48:23] <+thecho1> oh so thats why the mission was in daytime LUL
[3:48:23] <%jiin6> the Curse
[3:48:27] <laguerrilha> Jesus, after Doom and Wolfeinstein remake it all started going down to shit again
[3:48:27] <starotter70> I thought you were gonna get outside and there was going to be no light at all
[3:48:29] <xeros720> still missing one storage container though
[3:48:29] <%deviljhojho94> weird
[3:48:30] <+krawtch> this radar looks like a colossal piece of shit
[3:48:30] <GUNxSPECTRE> Is this game Open World?
[3:48:33] <Xiangchang> Consume product.
[3:48:36] <InugamiTheHound> run simba and never return
[3:48:37] <+Roundelay11> Good old fashioned Bethesda jank
[3:48:39] <Kurrisum> I mean it wouldn't be bathesda without massive bugs?
[3:48:44] <+DingusMcFadden> Is John Goodman in this one?
[3:48:47] <Rafikator> @AngriestPat how is rage 2 pat first time seeing gameplay
[3:48:51] <%Finakala> It's not even developed by Bethesda though
[3:48:52] <Caidezes> Bethesda didn't make this, people.
[3:48:52] <%Bt_Robot> Something is wrong with the lighting engine, there's no ambient lighting
[3:48:53] <%jiin6> thanks bethesda
[3:48:53] <+krawtch> you were running towards a tracked objective, and it was getting further away
[3:48:55] <waifoong98> it is pretty fast
[3:49:01] <+Fyre_link> besides this being buggy is this worth getting, looks like a fun tiime @AngriestPat
[3:49:04] <CalderGaming> I wonder if we'd see the defib prompt if pat switched over to mouse and keyboard. just a wild guess.
[3:49:05] <%AncelDeLambert> can Bethesda do ANYTHING right?
[3:49:05] <Pookiedaexzile> probably shouldn't make lighting physics for games that are building spefic
[3:49:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hahahahahaha
[3:49:07] <+gantz_zero> lolwhat
[3:49:15] <shinichizio> Autosaves not generous. Noted.
[3:49:15] <%MagickBurritoh> Such a good game
[3:49:16] <pochiyeah> I love how they are trying to copy mick gordon's style in this game, the music thats is
[3:49:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you thought you escaped
[3:49:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe set actual light sources
[3:49:17] <%Nobrev> did you not hit save?
[3:49:18] <+kawachipto> people never understand the difference between developers and publishers
[3:49:19] <Djinnazz> Quit.
[3:49:20] <T0KK0Knight> So impressive.
[3:49:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> How did Rage get a sequel and not literally anything else
[3:49:25] <+DingusMcFadden> Do you have a flashlight?
[3:49:28] <+krawtch> bethesda published this, and likely put their QA department on it
[3:49:29] <TootPirate> The radar showed back up when you were leaving @AngriestPat
[3:49:29] <%MattDemers> Groundhog day
[3:49:37] <%AncelDeLambert> My "never buy Bethesda products ever again" promise holds strong
[3:49:39] <+d_huggs> I am legitimately confused
[3:49:39] <%Laecerelius> yeah it had one pip as you were leaving
[3:49:40] <T0KK0Knight> Phil? Phil Connors?
[3:49:45] <%NWR_James> Come on!
[3:49:50] <CalderGaming> @GUNxSPECTRE i mean it's 8 years later what do you want
[3:49:53] <xeros720> oh yeah, just saw it ping for a sec
[3:49:53] <starotter70> @kawachipto Like with Activision and Sekiro?
[3:49:54] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat the fact you're missing a storage container is probably causing this.
[3:49:54] <+silentnight99999> im here for cat
[3:49:57] <TootPirate> leaving the building
[3:49:58] <%Laecerelius> when you were shooting that glass
[3:49:58] <pochiyeah> so ur not gonna play doom eternal? WutFace
[3:49:59] <ZZCooldown> rage 2 the sequel everyone wanted Kappa
[3:50:03] <%Laecerelius> before leaving the building
[3:50:04] <$SGrim> The respawning, that is
[3:50:05] <%Finakala> If anything it was Bethesda pushing the game out to a strict schedule and not giving time to check stuff
[3:50:07] <xeros720> it's probably on the 3rd floor or something
[3:50:07] <%salty_syd913> in the building
[3:50:11] <GUNxSPECTRE> Rage 2 got the Sonic Spirit in it
[3:50:13] <+paladinstarbuster> inside
[3:50:18] <CurrySauseBandit> Yep
[3:50:18] <GUNxSPECTRE> Literally unkillable
[3:50:29] <KangarooCyborg> If Bethesda developed this, it would be an unplayable stuttering mess
[3:50:29] <CurrySauseBandit> Inside the building
[3:50:30] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:50:31] <%Laecerelius> wooow
[3:50:32] <+gantz_zero> gamefaqs says there's no flashlight and not even a brightness adjustment
[3:50:36] <Ion_Laser> :D

[3:57:52] <%jiin6> break down fun
[3:57:53] <%NovaKnightmare> that seems like a rental from 2009
[3:57:53] <dekkitout> It sure was funny when "the lights was out"
[3:57:53] <%Divryne> LUL
[3:57:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Day one Patch
[3:57:54] <%MightyMaxT> Seems like a game you enjoy playing not watching
[3:57:54] <%AuksMattin> enbGood
[3:57:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Definitely something to try on sale
[3:57:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> not worth 60 bucks for me tho.
[3:57:57] <Huntercd> @AngriestPat Are you going to play Wisp when she comes out?
[3:57:58] <%Faustgesicht> that was quite the sudden stop, i must say
[3:57:58] <%Iwantscandy> Iwantscandy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Is this the perfect turn your brain off shooter?
[3:57:59] <waifoong98> It probablly is just an ok but unmemorable at best
[3:57:59] <bonzosan> Yeah
[3:58:00] <SpaceGuntank> it fell apart like bread in water at the end there
[3:58:00] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat but was it 60 dollars fun?
[3:58:02] <Rafikator> seems like the gameplay is good but the game is a bit jank
[3:58:02] <%deviljhojho94> Fun outta 10
[3:58:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Day Fun Patch
[3:58:04] <zamzoph> evo17Shill evo17Shill CoolCat evo17Shill evo17Shill
[3:58:04] <T0KK0Knight> Bethesda patches?
[3:58:06] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat How long till Shy calls you scum?
[3:58:07] <$hatesdps> funny you mention fallout, i thought he was playing fallout at first with more bloom
[3:58:08] <jamesofn> yeah but thats because your brain is stupid
[3:58:09] <shotgang86> i Just got here I dunno
[3:58:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:58:15] <InugamiTheHound> so its like every AC game out there
[3:58:15] <%patman22897> does it appeal to your ocd?
[3:58:16] <%ElenaManetta> Aren't MMOs better for that
[3:58:17] <$Valdorick> It scratches the chin of the headgoblins
[3:58:18] <Djinnazz> naw
[3:58:21] <%jiin6> Pat is OCD
[3:58:24] <lezzan94> 50 GB patch?
[3:58:26] <%BallinArbiter> No
[3:58:27] <InsomniacPersona> Feel free to stream again I'll still watch
[3:58:28] <MasterDecoder> XD
[3:58:29] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz Warframe is free
[3:58:29] <%ElenaManetta> I assume you make back the money very fast
[3:58:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 60 dollars is a lot of money
[3:58:30] <Pookiedaexzile> No no, I gotta Better one, Day One Catch
[3:58:30] <buffmurffy> its a work expense
[3:58:32] <waifoong98> It is a business investment basically
[3:58:34] <MarylandJutsu> ELMO BUTT
[3:58:36] <ZZCooldown> just say no LUL
[3:58:38] <jcflyguy> Is it 60 dollars "if I still worked retail" fun?
[3:58:39] <%Laecerelius> Spend money on games to make money making them!
[3:58:40] <+gantz_zero> and games like Warframe broke perception @AngriestPat
[3:58:40] <$SGrim> Man with OCD likes completing lists. World shocked! woopsKek
[3:58:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Soft No
[3:58:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> LUL yeahno
[3:58:48] <+Bad1uck> We're enabling Pat to make consequence-free mistakes!
[3:58:51] <+Roundelay11> it looks like steam sale #30 worth of fun
[3:58:55] <+Starlight_Gamer> for me answer is probably no
[3:58:56] <%Solidus_113> Skill Up said on twitter it's a $20 game
[3:58:57] <%ElenaManetta> When you have a steady mid-to-high income, "was it worth it" becomes a non-factor
[3:58:57] <Kurrisum> It look more like 30$ fun
[3:58:59] <12gagerager> Think I'm gonn wait for a sale.
[3:59:01] <InsomniacPersona> Would rate this as a good streamable game for audience @AngriestPat ?
[3:59:04] <DevilDeus13> Is it 60 dollars made from working retail worth it
[3:59:05] <+ktothec99> Summer sale fun
[3:59:06] <dekkitout> Any of yall gonna check out Dauntless next week?
[3:59:07] <worldbrand> Is it one day of retail fun?
[3:59:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Is it as good as other similarly priced games?
[3:59:08] <%HyraFukit> Love this man
[3:59:12] <%jiin6> @AngriestPat did you have enough fun to recommend this game?
[3:59:12] <jamesofn> would you recommend someone buy it if they DONT stream games? @AngriestPat
[3:59:13] <zamzoph> It'll probably be forty in like a month
[3:59:14] <AlvinTheLiar> $60 more like $90 up here
[3:59:15] <krymzen5> plus games drop in price so fast now
[3:59:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Soft no hard nah
[3:59:16] <%Laecerelius> I'd wait for at least a 50% off sale
[3:59:18] <$Valdorick> Warframe really raises the parkour slooter bar.
[3:59:19] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean not only is the price probably gonna drop like a stone but they're gonna have so much more stuff developed for it
[3:59:21] <CrypticMochi> Basically get it on sale
[3:59:22] <XelGel> OOF
[3:59:22] <Rafikator> yeah
[3:59:23] <KangarooCyborg> beat me to it
[3:59:25] <%Bt_Robot> Space hats are an infinite money hole.
[3:59:25] <Neo_Kaiser> Off brand Doom
[3:59:25] <+Eclipse_knight_> no
[3:59:26] <$SGrim> PAT FINGERED ME woopsGasm
[3:59:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> buy doom instead lol
[3:59:26] <%AncelDeLambert> oh damn
[3:59:26] <Pookiedaexzile> but Dooms like 30 bucks
[3:59:27] <%Finakala> DOOM (2016) is dope as hell
[3:59:27] <Saltmeisterr> wtf
[3:59:29] <%ElenaManetta> But I don't like Doom!
[3:59:29] <%AncelDeLambert> OUCH
[3:59:29] <Caidezes> Mad Max though.
[3:59:32] <%Tearonex> DOOM is a goddamn masterpiece
[3:59:33] <+Sendaar> Doom like 2016?
[3:59:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Blood Dragon especially
[3:59:34] <%BallinArbiter> It’ll probably go on sale soon
[3:59:35] <%jiin6> any of them doom
[3:59:37] <12gagerager> DOOM 2016 is the shit.
[3:59:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> B L O O D D R A G O N
[3:59:40] <%Ranryu692> Far Cry 4 is good, too
[3:59:40] <a_mad_dragon> i prefer far cry 2 above all the others
[3:59:41] <%Finakala> Blood Dragon is so good
[3:59:41] <XelGel> wait for doom 2
[3:59:42] <%BallinArbiter> Also 4
[3:59:43] <%AncelDeLambert> that's an "Oh Snap"
[3:59:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Doom came out 3 tears ago
[3:59:44] <+Roundelay11> FC 4 is better than 3
[3:59:46] <%deviljhojho94> Damned by faint praise
[3:59:46] <Pookiedaexzile> So play Brutal Doom?
[3:59:46] <+krawtch> is this "over half of a days pay from a soul crushing job" fun
[3:59:47] <ZZCooldown> HOW WORSE THOUGH
[3:59:47] <CptBritches> FarCry 4 is better than 3
[3:59:48] <CalderGaming> then play Rage 1 Kappa
[3:59:49] <JxsFusion> blood dragon has aged poorly
[3:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:50] <Ion_Laser> Doom in general is a goddamn treasure
[3:59:51] <%BallinArbiter> I really like far cry 4
[3:59:53] <KangarooCyborg> PUT THAT ON THE BOX
[3:59:54] <$MajorCrasher> this seems way better than FarCry tbh
[3:59:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Just play Dusk
[3:59:57] <%ElenaManetta> Hey guys remember that one scene in the Doom movie
[3:59:58] <KangarooCyborg> "You could do worse"
[3:59:58] <+ktothec99> Buy the Doom soundtrack instead
[4:00:02] <Rafikator> seems like the gameplay is good but the game is a bit jank
[4:00:03] <+DingusMcFadden> So basically the first Rage but new?
[4:00:04] <+Sendaar> Unpopular opinion: I prefer the base game to Blood Dragon
[4:00:04] <+blewbeary> thats a shame
[4:00:05] <InugamiTheHound> far cry 4 is really good IMO better than 3 and 5
[4:00:05] <%Bt_Robot> You could do a mercenaries or a Saboteur
[4:00:06] <T0KK0Knight> Did pat acknowledge the WoD Werewolves game?
[4:00:08] <$Valdorick> Big Piss
[4:00:10] <%wombatlime> Piss time
[4:00:10] <Djinnazz> Doom is like 80 gigs though
[4:00:13] <MarylandJutsu> BIG ELMO PETS
[4:00:13] <%jiin6> Australia is not interesting
[4:00:14] <12gagerager> Rage 2 has too much fucking neon.
[4:00:14] <DevilDeus13> At least youll feel better buying this than Borderlands 3
[4:00:16] <%AncelDeLambert> aight
[4:00:16] <%BallinArbiter> Same
[4:00:17] <%Divryne> RATMEN.
[4:00:17] <+krawtch> also, RAGE 2 has denuvo
[4:00:18] <%izaich> pet the toilet, piss on elmo
[4:00:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @ElenaManetta I 'member.
[4:00:21] <dekkitout> Or wait for Doom Eternal and see if it gets bundled with Doom
[4:00:22] <RealPT1> shooting and fighting in here looks much better than far crys though
[4:00:23] <MasterDecoder> @ seconds over
[4:00:25] <MasterDecoder> *2
[4:00:26] <Saltmeisterr> WE'RE THE RATS
[4:00:28] <prime_name> It's been two seconds
[4:00:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Play that rat version of Anna, Pat, you go escort that mission

[4:00:46] <waifoong98> @thebonebard old news
[4:00:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Aight so Play dusk, Ion Maiden, or Doom Again
[4:00:48] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@DingusMcFadden) (warning)
[4:00:48] <%jiin6> Pat is not the big pat dat makes all of da rulez
[4:00:58] <%thebonebard> is that old? im just finding out now
[4:01:01] <Pookiedaexzile> oooor you can boot up Gears of war 2
[4:01:02] <$Valdorick> In this day and age, if it costs 60 dollars, just assume its got Denouvo, and if doesn't cost 60 dollars, still be suspicious.
[4:01:05] <MarylandJutsu> Cant wait till RAT STREAM tommorow
[4:01:07] <%Finakala> Just get DOOM II: Hell on Earth and download Valiant.wad
[4:01:12] <%izaich> @thebonebard Is the Council that social RPG game with George Washington and Napolean?
[4:01:12] <emillionghost> we been knew but we're excited @thebonebard

[4:01:21] <%Finakala> Such a good mapset
[4:01:23] <%thebonebard> yea that one
[4:01:25] <+DingusMcFadden> Wow, really?
[4:01:31] <Kurrisum> It is already compromised anyways?
[4:01:31] <thebmanishere> how is Rage so far chat?
[4:01:39] <Ion_Laser> Play old Doom and wait for Sigil to come out
[4:01:44] <waifoong98> @thebmanishere rage inducing Kappa
[4:01:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Rage 2 gets a meh from me.
[4:01:48] <12gagerager> Kinda Jank
[4:01:52] <%izaich> People were worried that the new Vtmd wouldn't have good bubs. But the Council did!
[4:02:04] <+krawtch> look forward to rage 2 being free on psplus in about 6 months
[4:02:06] <xeros720> the towns and driving seem pretty awful, but there's some neat combat abilities and weapon upgrades
[4:02:06] <+DingusMcFadden> He's never coming back, chat! omgomgomg!
[4:02:07] <thebmanishere> lol Kappa @waifoong98
[4:02:08] <%jiin6> Rage looks ok...but get it on discount maybe
[4:02:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Or fuck it who wants to play Vanquished again
[4:02:13] <+Sendaar> Seems like it is the most 6-7 out of 10 game that ever 6-7 out of 10'd
[4:02:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Member Vanquished
[4:02:16] <waifoong98> @Pookiedaexzile ME

[4:02:27] <thebmanishere> Gotcha, I figured it was gonna be okay but wasn't too sure abot it
[4:02:38] <%Finakala> I dunno, Skyrim is a pretty strong candidate for most 6/10 game ever made
[4:02:44] <+krawtch> this game seems like the people making it just went thru the motions
[4:02:45] <suikudo> Is Wisp out yet?
[4:02:55] <waifoong98> @Finakala the bugs drop that shit to a 4/10 for me personally
[4:02:57] <%Videodragon64> who do i ask for a discord invite?
[4:02:59] <MasterDecoder> @suikudo Not yet
[4:03:01] <+krawtch> like they didnt care about what they made, they just clock in, do work and go home at the end of the day
[4:03:05] <Lurantis_> Is the stream over?

[4:03:11] <emillionghost> it runs. has some stuff. horrible dialogue
[4:03:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, this game seems like people in a boardroom just did all the checkmarks in previously successful games.
[4:03:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Skyrim is a "why did I trade MAss Effect 2 for it at the Lunchtable I'm such a dumbass outta ten

[4:05:34] <+krawtch> floating wincing head in space is the realest Pat though
[4:05:39] <%afronooch> LUL
[4:05:42] <xeros720> honestly, the cube is what i would've picked

[4:06:47] <+redstonej> RAGE 2 Chill out
[4:06:48] <%ElenaManetta> Sure is, AngriestPat
[4:06:55] <+krawtch> funny how a game named RAGE fails to elicit emotions at all
[4:06:58] <+blewbeary> i guess theyre all just rats in a cage
[4:06:59] <zamzoph> CHILL doesn't push as many copies
[4:07:05] <$Valdorick> Yes, isn't it strange there's such a chill game named RAGE, AngriestPat?
[4:07:05] <T0KK0Knight> There were those wrasslers with the buttplugs. They weren't very chill.
[4:07:10] <haveswordmuststing> @angriestpat HOT off the presses, Reggie also vores the toilet
[4:07:10] <%jiin6> Chill guys apatGib rbzGun
[4:07:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Halo difficulty spikes, eh?
[4:07:12] <lezzan94> the game is like a sleeping pill..
[4:07:34] <%izaich> Where do I go from 0?
[4:07:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat give BABY snoot boops for us
[4:07:41] <+krawtch> @lezzan94 if the sleeping pill was pink
[4:07:49] <T0KK0Knight> Kiwami 1 then Kiwami 2.
[4:08:01] <haveswordmuststing> @izaich 1
[4:08:03] <Kurrisum> Blood Dragon?
[4:08:08] <%Finakala> Blood Dragon did a pretty good job with it
[4:08:08] <Nina96> @AngriestPat we gonna raid Woolie?
[4:08:08] <CastellanVon> Blood Dragon
[4:08:12] <%izaich> Kiwami 1, or just straight up 1?
[4:08:18] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[4:08:19] <%BallinArbiter> What am I in a video game?
[4:08:21] <%AncelDeLambert> you may all thank me
[4:08:21] <$El_Desperad0> Blood Dragon did it the worst
[4:08:24] <%AncelDeLambert> baby has been booped
[4:08:35] <+krawtch> baby status: booped
[4:08:35] <%BallinArbiter> apatSmug apatBlep
[4:08:37] <+blewbeary> @AngriestPat deadpool when hes like oh a sewer level, everyone loves those
[4:08:41] <+Das_Prints> The very beginning of Banko Kazooie Nuts and Bolts had a pretty good gag based on that.
[4:08:56] <haveswordmuststing> Woolie's stream is at its Denouement
[4:08:57] <buffmurffy> cats are just children who live on the floor
[4:08:58] <%BallinArbiter> apatWink
[4:09:01] <%Finakala> Actually DOOM (2016) does it subtly a few times
[4:09:04] <starotter70> And a good baby is just a cat
[4:09:07] <haveswordmuststing> no raiding him this time
[4:09:22] <+krawtch> imagine doom but without glory kills, and add in a lot of talking to npcs
[4:09:35] <%Ranryu692> @izaich Kiwami and Kiwami 2. the first kiwami isn't great, but the original didn't age well
[4:09:38] <xeros720> Doom does a much better job of it since Doomguy is old, tired, and silent
[4:09:52] <%Ranryu692> @izaich Kiwami 2 is fantastic, though
[4:09:57] <DracaenaLeaf> noooo
[4:10:08] <+krawtch> like that super boring unskippable cutscene where you talk to the robot samuel hayden for 3 minutes, except it happens all the time and its 10 minutes now
[4:10:13] <%wombatlime> slightly center
[4:10:14] <%Zamorouskiwhich> But Emlo! apatGib

[4:10:21] <KohryuZX> Yakuza 2's police woman is basically Poochie the dog from simpsons
[4:10:22] <%AuksMattin> "I love being dead" - Pat 2019
[4:10:23] <+bear_breaker20> Doomguy is not tired just has been through the same shit over and over again lol
[4:10:24] <%afronooch> this feels wrong
[4:10:43] <$rdark_ksu> Eat the long pork

[4:10:52] <%Finakala> We live in a society
[4:10:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Montreal started shooting up the place when the police went on strike
[4:10:59] <%Zamorouskiwhich> "If only I could RAGE"
[4:11:02] <Nina96> sounds like shadow fans

[4:14:05] <%AncelDeLambert> new swears can be cool. That is not.
[4:14:07] <Saltmeisterr> FRUK
[4:14:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Farscape did that too
[4:14:09] <Ion_Laser> It was on SyFy. And you can't say fuck on SyFy
[4:14:09] <emillionghost> frack
[4:14:09] <ShichiNoBushi> You ever play the board game where the players mostly cooperate except some of them are secretly cylons?
[4:14:10] <%logoth_> We are not talking about the fragile body of GAIUS FRAKKIN BALTAR
[4:14:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Very not schwee
[4:14:12] <%ElenaManetta> Twilight Zone never swore and was fine, then the new one had swearing and it was super weird

[4:14:30] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat all the paper in BSG had t heir corners cut so they look like FUTURE PAPER
[4:14:30] <%ElenaManetta> Couldn't they JUST say "screw you"?
[4:14:31] <laguerrilha> They invented Frack??????????
[4:14:31] <%cTAKU> It was perfect for prime time television
[4:14:32] <%AncelDeLambert> woot
[4:14:32] <Saltmeisterr> GET FRAKED
[4:14:33] <IntrepidEye> There was one episode they snuck in a fuck
[4:14:33] <Sloavon> SCHWAY
[4:14:34] <waifoong98> ?????
[4:14:34] <%thebonebard> in one of yahtzees books its a sci fi story where every swear is based off of math terminology
[4:14:35] <+krawtch> if the new word is intended to be a swear then why not censor that too, since the intent behind it is the same as saying FUCK
[4:14:36] <%logoth_> Schway
[4:14:40] <$Valdorick> Oh hey, the RAGE2 defibrillator just came up on my screen, THANKS MODERN INTERNET!
[4:14:42] <%AncelDeLambert> it's fun to say
[4:14:45] <whittacre> Schwarbage!
[4:14:48] <waifoong98> What is this Christian Bale Rage level of stupid words LUL
[4:14:48] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHA
[4:14:52] <Ion_Laser> I heard Schway turned up on The Flash this season
[4:14:54] <%DigitalJoshie> WHAT!
[4:14:58] <$El_Desperad0> That's not funny at all
[4:14:59] <DevilDeus13> Schway is cool tho
[4:15:06] <%Ranryu692> it did show up on Flash this season
[4:15:10] <+krawtch> @Valdorick did you do the thing to help out tho
[4:15:10] <MasterDecoder> Honestly, we need more Batman Beyond
[4:15:16] <%ArcanumMBD> @Ion_Laser it did, cause a girl came from the future and says it a bunch
[4:15:17] <%Ranryu692> schway was trending on Twitter because of it
[4:15:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Shway is quite Keen daddy-o
[4:15:22] <Caidezes> Batman Beyond was so unappreciated.
[4:15:27] <ShichiNoBushi> When will there be a Batman Beyond movie?
[4:15:37] <T0KK0Knight> A long time ago?
[4:15:42] <MasterDecoder> @ShichiNoBushi Hopefully some day, but probably never
[4:15:55] <$Valdorick> @krawtch aw yeah man, I defibed the fuck outta that crashed game!
[4:15:55] <%Ranryu692> @masterdecoder the comics have been good. he finally has a robin
[4:15:56] <%ArcanumMBD> Playing Arkham City with the batman beyond skin on is the closest we'll get to a Beyond game and that makes me sad
[4:15:58] <$El_Desperad0> @caidezes I disagree. It got the right amount of appreciation
[4:15:59] <Ion_Laser> Isn't there supposed to be a Batman Beyond animated movie?
[4:16:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @ShichiNoBushi Return of the Joker
[4:16:12] <MasterDecoder> @Ranryu692 Really? I'll have to get into them
[4:16:17] <Caidezes> @El_Desperad0 It needed MORE.
[4:16:18] <VJdarkworld> batman beyond was a documentary
[4:16:19] <waifoong98> He is probably listening like a podcast
[4:16:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ShichiNoBushi There is a movie. Return of the Joker. Live action? Probably never.

[4:17:42] <+miguelrod777> Unless something interesting happens
[4:17:42] <DevilDeus13> Oh definitely
[4:17:42] <Videogamer4> half of the time I do
[4:17:44] <+Sendaar> Currently listening while grinding in ffxiv
[4:17:45] <whittacre> not gonna lie, your "Come Back quick" gag in the minecraft story got me hard
[4:17:52] <Ion_Laser> Doom is the best
[4:17:53] <%ElenaManetta> I tend to perk up when Pat goes WHAT THE FUCKKKKK
[4:17:53] <%BallinArbiter> I played hoi iv while listening tonight
[4:17:56] <Pookiedaexzile> You adblock boys killed Superbestfriends.....You gotta watch the Mcdonalds to make the number go
[4:17:56] <Videogamer4> DOOM IS GREAT
[4:17:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Are we be play the video game now?
[4:17:57] <+krawtch> when its Pat & Paige arguing and one of them is off screen, thats some good podcast radio
[4:17:58] <$Valdorick> DOOM is pretty good
[4:17:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @ECRead oh man FUCK farming for Nekros and Limbo, they're both the same!
[4:17:59] <Saltmeisterr> DOM
[4:18:00] <DevilDeus13> Soothing Pat voice
[4:18:00] <Pookiedaexzile> DOOM
[4:18:02] <T0KK0Knight> But what if it ISN'T?
[4:18:03] <waifoong98> what if it is buggy on launch Kappa
[4:18:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Just wait
[4:18:06] <$humbelpie> hey everyone how's your week been? im going to Japan in October, is there anything i should do in Tokyo? like go to Kabukicho
[4:18:07] <JackalKing> You dont have to! They said it will be on Steam!
[4:18:08] <%AncelDeLambert> goddamn rare axi rare roll!
[4:18:10] <%Jacobblast> im doing bullshit in FF14 and looking over to see elmo
[4:18:10] <Ion_Laser> Bethesda launcher? WutFace
[4:18:10] <%izaich> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[4:18:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Or pirate......
[4:18:11] <haisho> no Doom is the "Turn your brain off until you get killed because you played stupid" game
[4:18:12] <Bladeexe> What if it gets on Epic then?
[4:18:15] <%Fenlig> if rage came out on steam why wouldnt Doom?
[4:18:16] <%DigitalJoshie> buy it on switch
[4:18:17] <zamzoph> Just buy it on the Epic Games Store Kappa
[4:18:18] <ManOfReason> woolie raid
[4:18:20] <lezzan94> but Bethesda launcher tho..
[4:18:20] <%ElenaManetta> Enjoy the future where everyone has their own streaming service and video game launcher
[4:18:22] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wait is this the end?
[4:18:23] <%ArcanumMBD> Gotta make a new email and get a new credit card for Doom Eternal because Bethesda launcher is going to break and leak everything probably
[4:18:24] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Can we just play DOOM 2016 again instead of Rage 2 Kappa
[4:18:24] <$El_Desperad0> I'm glad to have a ps4
[4:18:27] <%Solidus_113> I'm excited for Mick Gordon music more than the actual game
[4:18:27] <%afronooch> woolies done
[4:18:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Leperchan
[4:18:28] <%VanaSkiller> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[4:18:29] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:18:31] <Maids4lyfe> this is why I'm getting it on console, no launcher on consoles
[4:18:34] <IntrepidEye> barfing mustard everywhere
[4:18:35] <Pookiedaexzile> LeperChaun
[4:18:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> If it gets on Epic, it'll still be on consoles.
[4:18:38] <Intolerable> Wait... less than 1K... IS THE STREAM ALMOST OVER?
[4:18:40] <%AncelDeLambert> gives survivors the LUPUS
[4:18:41] <T0KK0Knight> Leprechauns do that?
[4:18:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Or a... chest burster?
[4:18:46] <%ElenaManetta> Wouldn't Paige be that one blind enemy in Pan's Labyrinth?
[4:18:47] <%BallinArbiter> apatGoblin
[4:18:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Intolerable Yes
[4:18:52] <%jiin6> Paige gimmick is to throw pat at people
[4:18:53] <Intolerable> BOOOOOO
[4:18:54] <+krawtch> paige would make survivors controls get reversed for 2 sec at random, so they run in circles and slam into walls like she does
[4:18:55] <%thebonebard> did paige and plague fuse to make pats perfect husband wife
[4:18:59] <alrobot2014> are there consumable items for you to steal from players and not use
[4:19:00] <majindusto> Pat the Leprechaun
[4:19:03] <+SuichiTanaka> And Pat wouldn't be allowed to use consumables
[4:19:04] <%TheMattman1313> So YOU'RE the Xenomorph
[4:19:07] <Ion_Laser> boo
[4:19:09] <Pookiedaexzile> No, HE would have a trope of goblins that speak in peoples ears, and say wrong information
[4:19:10] <%bevyrage> hehehe~
[4:19:10] <$Valdorick> Idea for a console - a console that is just every launcher, but on a console, on your TV, in your Car.
[4:19:11] <haisho> does that mean you wanna be a Loot Midget in Borderlands?
[4:19:12] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Aw we finished. :(
[4:19:17] <starotter70> yup
[4:19:18] <haisho> because those are a thing
[4:19:23] <$humbelpie> @AngriestPat Pat if you ever go to Japan again go to the real Onomichi it is really famous for its ramen
[4:19:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> start with Yakuza 6 and go backwards
[4:19:28] <majindusto> ALWAYS START 0
[4:19:29] <%jiin6> Yakuzies 0
[4:19:29] <+MisoPhat_> you'd be like the saw doll riding on a bicycle except you'd be in a tiny baby rolling chair aka your gaming cube
[4:19:33] <%ElenaManetta> You know that visual where an enemy opens their mouth and bees or bugs fly out? I like to imagine that is Pat, but with goblins
[4:19:38] <+HazyCases> But Yakuza 5 has Tanimura
[4:19:38] <%Rngiddion> 0 is the best for sure
[4:19:40] <StripesUltimateEdition> Is this post-game or pre-game banter?
[4:19:42] <waifoong98> always start 0, just not RE Kappa
[4:19:45] <%DigitalJoshie> I started on kawami 1
[4:19:45] <+krawtch> start with yakuza 0 and pretend resident evil 0 doesnt exist
