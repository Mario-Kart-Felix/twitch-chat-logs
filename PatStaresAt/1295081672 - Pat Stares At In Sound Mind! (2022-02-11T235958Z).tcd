[0:01:52] <@MistyMntns> That is good.
[0:01:59] <@MistyMntns> I have ice cream so my night is all set
[0:02:13] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Am I crazy or did Pat say Paige would be streaming tonight?
[0:02:17] <@MistyMntns> I am thinking i might play some Earthbound Beginnings while watching
[0:02:31] <%maskofmichael> @NigelSchnauzerpug thinking the same thing
[0:02:38] <@MistyMntns> You might be crazy?
[0:02:47] <%king_wragles> Check her Twitter, got good updates there
[0:02:51] <@MistyMntns> But I have also not watched the stream in a little bit
[0:02:52] <%king_wragles> and... other kinds of posts

[0:03:07] <%twistedj3ster> But this stream is of Sound Mind at least
[0:03:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I know he said Paige would be streaming Demon Souls yesterday. I guess it wasn't today then.

[0:20:30] <zhenthrim213> Geif comes in for the attack

[0:24:29] <%Shonen_hero> also Paige, everyone I share that tweet about Kirby all argue Kirby doesn't have a butt 'cause there's no way he'd produce waste.
[0:24:32] <$Order_of_Mystery> tell that to an ape before it peels *you* like a banana
[0:24:34] <@MistyMntns> Huzzah!
[0:24:34] <Sunstalker> Now she can be blind more accurately PogChamp
[0:24:36] <+CrimKangaroo> yes, but did you wear them?
[0:24:36] <+Nexoosen> she'll actually see litterally anything in demons' souls
[0:24:36] <%Dementedpenguin> I remember hearing about it in another stream.
[0:24:36] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> You have DEFINITELY not told us
[0:24:37] <JimJamr> It's a miracle!
[0:24:40] <%JoshManVGH> You wore them on stream like last week didnt you?
[0:24:40] <Zeif00> Too much power
[0:24:46] <%barrakuta371> And fell even with them on the other day
[0:24:47] <%JoshManVGH> For the POE thing?
[0:24:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Watch her be worse than before
[0:24:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> Paige's limiter has been removed

[0:24:57] <%Arweynn> so they have a remaining lifespan of minutes, gotcha
[0:24:57] <Indigo_Automaton> Now she'll be taking in too much information and be more confused
[0:24:57] <%marvel877> Only one pair survived? I thought she ordered 5 pairs.
[0:24:59] <%JoshManVGH> Ouch
[0:25:07] <lesnardactyl> Make Paige do the shadow puzzle again
[0:25:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Gief is so sad now

[0:30:02] <+Jack8274> If Pat was a comedian he would constantly confused for Louis CK
[0:30:07] <+Nexoosen> be one of those dudes that go round promoting their own shows to their friends constantly
[0:30:10] <lesnardactyl> Pat would just have an anxiety attack on stage
[0:30:23] <Teddygrahams1982> hey pat  how's it going
[0:30:24] <+diathex> all streams scripted confirmed.
[0:30:27] <twistedj3ster> that's...what you do every stream

[0:30:35] <%GingaNZ> Yo Pat, that warhammer stream the other day was really good
[0:30:37] <%MelBrooksKA> Has Pat used like 25 wet wipes in the past minute?

[0:30:44] <MaybeFalco> improv deez nuts

[0:31:02] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[0:31:03] <@MistyMntns> Yes And
[0:31:03] <+notgoodatnamessorry> improv is a waking nightmare
[0:31:05] <gothmanmothman> ok I love those kinds of bands tho, terrible garbage bands make me live
[0:31:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> get loud and rowdy in some motherfuckers house
[0:31:06] <Bonebagmel> Is what Oneyplays
[0:31:07] <@MistyMntns> That is Improv
[0:31:11] <+capybruhArt> improv is being man
[0:31:13] <FievelFails> If you're on camera everything is a bit
[0:31:14] <%chance_h> Oh no that was very improv-ssable
[0:31:22] <+lumporr> have you ever seen good improv though?
[0:31:22] <Profmcstevie> Improv is normal conversation, just to a fake scenario
[0:31:23] <%Brassnarwhal> improv as a structured form is the worst for sure
[0:31:24] <%Shonen_hero> you can be like, a funny person, that's sort of kinda has a natural sense of comedic timing without like writing it out
[0:31:26] <+capybruhArt> gender is improv
[0:31:28] <+diathex> And the UCB is a cult.
[0:31:29] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> ans then some
[0:31:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> my favorite standup bit ever was a video of a comedian with a guitar chatting shit back towards a heckler, and then smashing his guitar over the heckler's head when the dude tried to come on stage
[0:31:31] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> good improv can be good, but bad improv is like peak cringe
[0:31:34] <%Shonen_hero> and good chemistry leads to good jokes
[0:31:36] <%preeeow> BibleThump1000 have some money also
[0:31:36] <Sunstalker> Improv people are the werewolf version of them
[0:31:38] <Treasure_Vault> When it's good it's good, but it's probably not good.
[0:31:43] <danpc5> what about mimes
[0:31:55] <@MistyMntns> Jesus Pat

[0:37:40] <gothmanmothman> @b1unkey LMAOO
[0:37:40] <Rav3Games> "as a percentage"
[0:37:41] <%Shonen_hero> I've never had to do that
[0:37:43] <$Ziegsy> zangief is staring down steve
[0:37:44] <+rdark_ksu> can confidently say thats a big 0 for me

[0:37:53] <kikoeru_san> the headphone with no music not the other thing
[0:37:53] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> weird flex
[0:37:54] <CaptainBlinkKold> Gief is checking out Steve
[0:37:55] <%Brassnarwhal> I've never done that
[0:37:57] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Zangief's quest for Paige's milk reminds me of how at my job Walmart has baby formula locked up and has to be brought up to my register so people can buy them. When people get mad that they're locked up, I always think "It's 30 dollars a can and if parents don't steal them a baby will starve. Don't blame the store, blame Capitalism".
[0:37:59] <%Shonen_hero> I've never had to do that because I'm naturally loud
[0:37:59] <WaxWitch> that's soul damage
[0:38:03] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> fuckers asking for directions on base
[0:38:04] <+lumporr> take them out for them!
[0:38:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> @tizz86 Thanks You
[0:38:07] <bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat GIEF loves Buscemi
[0:38:09] <Teddygrahams1982> genger bear
[0:38:09] <@ssjklyco> The feeling when people don't talk to you until you decide to put your headphones on
[0:38:10] <%marvel877> "Pat, look out for that car!" "Go to hell, I'm wearing these to not listen to you!"
[0:38:11] <FievelFails> I have two cd/radio combos taped to my ears
[0:38:18] <%NitronStreams> seems like thats either a 0 or and inordiantly large number depending on the person
[0:38:18] <%Chichen> GET EM GIEF
[0:38:24] <%maskofmichael> He wants the toys that are back there
[0:38:28] <kikoeru_san> maybe he needs to shit
[0:38:30] <@MistyMntns> I pretend to be deaf with my in ear headphones
[0:38:30] <%Broand> it's pat!
[0:38:33] <+CrimKangaroo> i pretend i can¬¥t hear/don¬¥t notice them
[0:38:37] <Setaro> Paige that is a good idea
[0:38:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael baby formula and condoms are some of the most stolen items at grocery stores
[0:38:38] <+lumporr> reach over and remove their headphones
[0:38:38] <%Chichen> Gief wants you take your headphones of
[0:38:41] <%Chichen> off*
[0:38:42] <%maskofmichael> But he doesn't know that
[0:38:44] <+JustToWatch> how do you approach a girl on the subway with headphones when she also has a 2 frame normal
[0:38:44] <Profmcstevie> The smug Boivin wanders into a moving vehicle after hearing muffled warnings from passers by
[0:38:44] <%Dova573> I may have just realize that I should not have my headphone on, when Im trying to talk that cute chick at work
[0:38:45] <%SpontaneousC> would pay money to watch Zangief fight Steve Busimi
[0:38:47] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat I know people who wear earphones to suppress audio pollution, cause they can't function without them outside.
[0:38:51] <%Shonen_hero> oh yeah
[0:38:53] <+diathex> i remember when i would mow lawns, i'de have ear phones on and a mower running, and people would still talk.
[0:39:03] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> what if they're dying pat
[0:39:07] <+diathex> "Mowin' some grass today, aye!?"
[0:39:08] <rat_boy1996> antisocial behavior
[0:39:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> i hated that my mom would literally almost always only try to get my attention AFTER i got home and had my headphones on
[0:39:13] <%Shonen_hero> I do that all the time, I pretend I don't hear someone without headphones and I just move on
[0:39:18] <alroy909> let them die
[0:39:20] <Rav3Games> based
[0:39:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael baby formula is a necessity so people steal it cause they need it and to resell it, teens and young adults steal condoms out of embarrassment a lot
[0:39:24] <%Broand> What if they're trying to complain to you about littering
[0:39:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Talking to people with headphones in is like kicking down a door
[0:39:28] <%KodoqueG> just unlucky i guess
[0:39:29] <%dalmek> I'd unplug my headphones so they hear my sick tunes as they fade
[0:39:33] <%SaiyanShoto> What if it‚Äôs an orphan?
[0:39:35] <alroy909> they are stupid enough to ask the person with headphones
[0:39:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Fucking owned
[0:39:35] <%twistedj3ster> What if they're waning you about the bus about to hit you?
[0:39:37] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I tend to have at least one headphone out when I'm with someone.
[0:39:53] <%CalderGaming> mercenary, not mercantile
[0:39:56] <$Ziegsy> I would raid on discord under the headphones and my ex would respond to the things he was hearing me say.

[0:40:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Weird
[0:40:21] <+lumporr> pat is a video game mercenary
[0:40:28] <%CalderGaming> Pat don't words

[0:41:16] <%Dova573> Sean download complete
[0:41:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't worry Woolie can't Avoid either
[0:41:19] <%chance_h> No way would Woolie EVER break the law
[0:41:21] <%Brassnarwhal> if he doesnt the devil takes his skin
[0:41:22] <+CrimKangaroo> i want to play sifu, but i¬¥m not getting it through the epic store
[0:41:22] <%cvp5127> get woolie into vore
[0:41:26] <%MooseIsGoose> its in his contract
[0:41:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> THat's good, I like that
[0:41:32] <%RetroCop87> Sifu seems like Returnal in no way, but their overall approach strikes me as the same
[0:41:32] <+toomuchsnarf> tommy wiseau had a ad for super bowl apparently
[0:41:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HA! HA! NO ESCAPE!
[0:41:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> and Woolie is the final boss. you WILL play fighting games
[0:41:40] <Profmcstevie> How to quit
[0:41:41] <penitentpendant> I'd say Woolie's content is addictive
[0:41:42] <kikoeru_san> not even close
[0:41:45] <%maskofmichael> Fighting Games is in Woolie's blood, his soul, his eyes
[0:41:47] <%Dementedpenguin> If it comes with a jetpack, maybe.
[0:41:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is he addicted to purple and green?
[0:41:48] <+lumporr> that's like addiction
[0:41:49] <%Brassnarwhal> passionate
[0:41:52] <%baka_sugoi> He love fight game
[0:41:53] <kikoeru_san> Woolie is a pro fight game enjoyer
[0:41:57] <ExpressNode> Fighting games going back to mid 2000s when they didn't exist
[0:41:58] <leargo> fighting game keeps pulling him back
[0:41:59] <%chance_h> Woolie loves Kirby therefore he‚Äôs already interested in vore
[0:42:03] <%Brassnarwhal> DRUG USE IS NOT ABUSE PAIGEUH
[0:42:08] <%JoshManVGH> Dude! That's awesome!
[0:42:08] <+CrimKangaroo> don¬¥t inject things into arteries. veins are much safer
[0:42:11] <blue8moon> :O
[0:42:13] <%RetroCop87> Woolie is Montreal's King of Cardgames
[0:42:13] <%Bailey__Gaming> what's "in sound mind" ?
[0:42:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Tep God
[0:42:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wooie Desires Battle
[0:42:15] <Zeif00> out of 200

[0:42:17] <%Shonen_hero> LUL
[0:42:17] <Explodincatz> the cardgame?
[0:42:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:42:18] <kikoeru_san> shit
[0:42:19] <%cherryburnout> woolie rejected a 3way for a fighting game, how is that not an addiction

[0:42:20] <LVL1_Scumbag> damn
[0:42:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> 147 out of how many?
[0:42:21] <%Shonen_hero> man
[0:42:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> Woolie would hit masters in Runeterra in a month
[0:42:25] <gothmanmothman> LMAOOOOO
[0:42:25] <GhoulishCripple> Woolie would rule the world if he got into Yugioh
[0:42:27] <kikoeru_san> What if Woolie played Magic
[0:42:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> he only likes real-time card games though
[0:42:30] <+lumporr> what are you drinking
[0:42:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> 148
[0:42:32] <sonuke_draws> the new king of games
[0:42:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Wooile vs the shadow games
[0:42:33] <%ChestMimik> woolie is a shonen protagonist in the wrong genre
[0:42:34] <Profmcstevie> Brain better than fingers
[0:42:34] <+happythetic> I'd hit a baby to see Woolie play some MtG
[0:42:34] <%Shonen_hero> Woolie should play Magic
[0:42:36] <+Catpurnicus> the daigo of deckbuilding
[0:42:36] <%RetroCop87> Gacha Madden
[0:42:39] <+pectusumbra> They really are 2 sides of the same coin
[0:42:40] <+Kyma1020> Woolie will eventually pull out the dual disk
[0:42:40] <%emperordread> Show him Griftlands, he'll love it
[0:42:41] <%maskofmichael> card games are like fighting games but with more turns
[0:42:42] <zhenthrim213> Woolie Vs yugioh master deul
[0:42:42] <penitentpendant> @chance_h Considering his reaction to the latest Kirby trailer. He's apparently into Absorption, not Vore.
[0:42:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> so you're saying Woolie is like Happy Gilmore?
[0:42:45] <%Bailey__Gaming> Woolie vs Yugioh
[0:42:46] <%Brassnarwhal> he's eating his burgers
[0:42:53] <boofybaps> Played Inscryption @PatStaresAt

[0:43:05] <+JustToWatch> you aren't good at fighting games either
[0:43:10] <+Catpurnicus> I wonder if Daigo ever wishes he was some kind of Starcraft savant or something
[0:43:11] <@MistyMntns> Play MTGA
[0:43:11] <Profmcstevie> Woolie gets Shoryu'd by Daigo, pulls out his deck of Yugioh cards "run it back"
[0:43:12] <Teddygrahams1982> like him playing tboi  on that one channel
[0:43:12] <%Brassnarwhal> Just tap it in give it a little tap tap tappy
[0:43:15] <Vi_Stri> chat what yugioh archtype would woolie play?
[0:43:16] <%GalacticLatte> GalacticLatte subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[0:43:17] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Say that Woolie is actually in the leaderboards in a card game.
[0:43:17] <yukichocomilk> very very good
[0:43:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> What a story
[0:43:23] <%valriot> I love the story, and fucking hate the endgame stil after 7 years

[0:43:37] <Enn19> @Vi_Stri Battlin' Boxers probably
[0:43:38] <+Catpurnicus> "I guess I'll do my 15 hit parry combo again, whatever"

[0:43:40] <%Brassnarwhal> @vi_stri is there a punch girl option?

[1:09:24] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[1:09:24] <%maskofmichael> kind of
[1:09:25] <BigYanno> I'm getting like 2010 vibes
[1:09:28] <Spagheddies> I have played this game, and it DEFINITELY feels old.
[1:09:28] <RyuuAoi> I mean it's aight
[1:09:29] <%vivaldiva> looks like an HL2 mod
[1:09:29] <%Bluwizard21> like the movement? or the aesthetic?
[1:09:29] <Teddygrahams1982> it's a horror game so duh
[1:09:30] <%CalderGaming> Penumbra or Condemned
[1:09:31] <%Brassnarwhal> just started
[1:09:31] <%Bailey__Gaming> Aurora Boreallas!?
[1:09:32] <%AncelDeLambert> this feels six years ago
[1:09:33] <%HotSauceFiend> But does it feel right as an old game, or does it just feel outdated
[1:09:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> it feels like a mysterious jogo
[1:09:35] <zanzibarian_hamster> Looks like a sourcemod
[1:09:36] <MaybeFalco> yeah
[1:09:36] <Profmcstevie> Not janky but not polished
[1:09:36] <%CalderGaming> hey same hat
[1:09:39] <ErikFeral> @Shonen_hero i think that's what i though drugs was in middle school
[1:09:40] <%Fooguwu> It feel like a Half life 2 mod
[1:09:40] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah, I'm hoping it's like Cndemened 1
[1:09:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> non-infinite flashlight, BOOOOOO
[1:09:46] <%Anime_Flux> almost a modern Amnesia vibe
[1:09:46] <%LazyBumNetwork> It looks like it feels like Half Life
[1:09:48] <RyuuAoi> Like 360 old?
[1:09:48] <thehullowed> I'm getting Slenderman flashbacks
[1:09:50] <AVkid_> no, holding in the left stick to AIM is the worst
[1:09:50] <Kalakukkoo> we create stuff used to do source mods before
[1:09:52] <@Ranryu692> oh no
[1:09:55] <youngin_______420> Penumbra
[1:09:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> BOOOOO
[1:09:55] <RyuuAoi> Or N64 old?
[1:09:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck off with the batteries in the flashlight
[1:10:01] <Teddygrahams1982> oh wow a horror game the feels new
[1:10:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> THIS MECHANIC SUCKS
[1:10:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> is this a Source mod?
[1:10:05] <Slim_Lipid> Howdy ü§†
[1:10:06] <ErikFeral> second hand floor high
[1:10:11] <%AncelDeLambert> at least in the new Freddy game, there were recharge STATIONS, so it was still basically free
[1:10:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wordle today was fucking deadly
[1:10:19] <%Shonen_hero> just cheat and give yourself infinite flashlight power
[1:10:21] <%HotSauceFiend> also purple fumes denotes aliens perhaps? I have no idea what this game is about?
[1:10:28] <AVkid_> this looks very fun btw
[1:10:30] <%HotSauceFiend> This IS Eurojank
[1:10:32] <RyuuAoi> Shitstorm REALNESS
[1:10:33] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, if I remember, the devs who made this made the Nightmare House 2 mod.
[1:10:34] <%Bluwizard21> Cause there's piss everywhere!
[1:10:34] <%SpareKeese> Oh boy
[1:10:36] <%NitronStreams> Euro jank confirmed?
[1:10:37] <+happythetic> how long before he busts out cheat engine for more battery

[1:10:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I didn't miss this time

[1:10:58] <Slim_Lipid> it would be called a mechanical room here wouldn't it
[1:11:01] <%SpareKeese> @Anime_Flux lol

[1:11:15] <%HotSauceFiend> is the battery recharging?
[1:11:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @happythetic i feel like he would change games first
[1:11:25] <%MidnightBurst12> dog is fed
[1:11:26] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He has a fat heart
[1:11:26] <AVkid_> look there's more than one type of math
[1:11:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> fat heart is bad
[1:11:33] <TheeRabbi> Better flashlight mechanic would be a 3 or 4 hour real-time battery, with zero batteries to replenish, encouraging a more anxious and risky gameplay style due to the threat of playing the rest of the game in the dark. Would be dope
[1:11:34] <%AncelDeLambert> he is VERY dense
[1:11:36] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Bulldogs love to be fat
[1:11:40] <%Brassnarwhal> mental fat

[1:12:22] <RyuuAoi> Undercover fatty
[1:12:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @theerabbi it's interesting but it's basically just putting a timer on the game, which can be good or bad
[1:12:24] <+Octopicake> fat in need for food.
[1:12:25] <theanora1> most of those layers are in the face

[1:21:26] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> George vs Rich Evans?
[1:21:26] <%Bailey__Gaming> EVIL SHIT
[1:21:26] <dukenux> Rich Evans is sexual tyrannosaurus
[1:21:32] <%maskofmichael> What if George Costanza was a skeleton?
[1:21:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Paige heard I'm a little Teapot and lost her shit at Short and stout
[1:21:33] <%SaiyanShoto> Rich Evans has an angelic laugh
[1:21:38] <%Shonen_hero> He's also become less round and more defined. Rich has been in pretty good shape recently
[1:21:51] <%Shonen_hero> probably 'cause of the diabetes
[1:21:59] <TheeRabbi> REALLY? AFTER 9 SHIT STORMS YOU JUST NOTICED?
[1:22:02] <mr_saturday93> does he ever pay attention!?
[1:22:03] <%Sotetsu> He's trying to not be scared.
[1:22:06] <%Shonen_hero> which is quite literally 'get healthy or die early'
[1:22:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> He's rushing through so he gets scared less Paige
[1:22:09] <dds333a> What?
[1:22:14] <%Sotetsu> Pay attention, Pat!
[1:22:16] <dds333a> Perish the thought
[1:22:17] <%twistedj3ster> Most horror games have unsatisfying stories anyway
[1:22:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat is a puss
[1:22:19] <%Anime_Flux> damn
[1:22:20] <%Bailey__Gaming> psaGib psaGib
[1:22:21] <%Felhad> psaGoblin
[1:22:21] <RyuuAoi> LET THEM FIGHT

[1:22:35] <+BignanasTheGawd> pat dosent pay attention
[1:22:35] <+Hexidimentional> the noise
[1:22:37] <cowboy_plague_doctor> it's art
[1:22:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> how do guitar work?
[1:22:41] <@TheYellowcouch> Whaaaat? Pat trying to not be a pussy???
[1:22:43] <%Sotetsu> Quiz him throughout the playthrough to make sure he is paying attention.
[1:22:51] <%Brassnarwhal> i love this emergency broadcast noise
[1:22:53] <dds333a> @bignanasthegawd indeed he does not
[1:22:53] <Zeif00> Picture different
[1:22:57] <+Hexidimentional> GRAB THE DRUGS
[1:22:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> I thought Paige was an immortal necromancer
[1:22:59] <penitentpendant> Like everyone: You're immortal until you're dead
[1:23:03] <yukichocomilk> i've never died, just saying
[1:23:03] <dds333a> In the event LUL
[1:23:05] <+Hexidimentional> he left the drugs behind
[1:23:05] <Indigo_Automaton> Yo the paintings were changing
[1:23:10] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Clues as to how she died falling down the stairs
[1:23:11] <cowboy_plague_doctor> just leave clues
[1:23:12] <Teddygrahams1982> and do this wtfSpin
[1:23:14] <%Anime_Flux> "There was a Paige here. She's gone now."
[1:23:20] <cowboy_plague_doctor> there's no goal it's just clues
[1:23:22] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige won‚Äôt die because Lincoln is waiting for her on the other side
[1:23:23] <RyuuAoi> Pat, does she know about the toilet afterlife?
[1:23:24] <%MelBrooksKA> I think you're entire life so far has proven you far from immortal
[1:23:26] <dds333a> She wants to be a map LUL
[1:23:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> finding dead loved ones left over drugs is seriously depressing
[1:23:29] <%Sotetsu> But only if Pat can have a flashlight with infinite batteries
[1:23:33] <@TheYellowcouch> we have never seen Paige and death in the same room
[1:23:34] <Blu_C> I decided to be immortal. It's worked out great so far.
[1:23:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Paige hid 600 D batteries around the house before she died
[1:23:40] <dukenux> this has Signal Sim energy to it
[1:23:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> everyone that has died wasn't me. checkmate atheists
[1:23:45] <cowboy_plague_doctor> nah that's normal
[1:23:46] <@Ranryu692> an elevator straight to HECK
[1:23:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @melbrookska really? cause she seems to be alive so far
[1:23:58] <+Hexidimentional> paige would hide 600 D cell batteries around the house
[1:24:01] <Indigo_Automaton> C U B E
[1:24:01] <+BignanasTheGawd> youre in the intro to bloodborne
[1:24:02] <%Felhad> Ponder the cube
[1:24:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> TIME CUBE
[1:24:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O it's the rubix cube
[1:24:05] <Treasure_Vault> no true scotsman has ever died
[1:24:11] <TheeRabbi> Paige will die with her face buried in George Costanza's rolls
[1:24:14] <dds333a> Nice locale
[1:24:18] <cowboy_plague_doctor> pat get out of that tape right now
[1:24:20] <DancesWitBalrog> @theyellowcouch well, she does like skeletons

[1:24:51] <%Bailey__Gaming> Collect all 8 of Paige's Pages, they are just 8 pages of SANS porn
[1:24:52] <dukenux> is that a giant casette
[1:24:54] <%MyNameIsRasus> "it seems tht i'm the one who is not in sound mind"
[1:24:57] <+Hexidimentional> it looked corroded
[1:24:59] <+BignanasTheGawd> it turns out, i am the In Sound Mind
[1:25:02] <foomaster22> Did Paige actually ever look up where the developers were from?
[1:25:07] <dds333a> Schroedinger
[1:25:10] <dds333a> LUL
[1:25:31] <cowboy_plague_doctor> sounds like TBI
[1:25:34] <dukenux> HP Lovecraft "Shape out of Space"
[1:25:34] <+Hexidimentional> oh so you're a head doctor
[1:25:36] <teefpal> @Anime_Flux Its the prequel biodock

[1:25:59] <%Anime_Flux> @teefpal ayyyy nice
[1:26:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nothing like a good old Pattern

[1:26:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @dakuu75 what's an ipod music is literally just in my phone
[1:26:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> This Scary game has Doom speed
[1:26:46] <Spagheddies> Y'all clowning on this game, but it's really well made.
[1:26:55] <%Fooguwu> someone said earlier these guys used to make source engine mods
[1:26:55] <dukenux> must... stay... A. Wake
[1:26:56] <TheeRabbi> Let's be real, Paige is the one actually getting this game done
[1:26:57] <%Dakuu75> @Brassnarwhal (oh no...)
[1:26:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> i must stay aware. awake. alert. amogus
[1:27:00] <+Hexidimentional> You lose color when the tape is playing huh
[1:27:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'll stay sane if I just stay awake forever

[1:27:13] <Guvzz> poor Verganha
[1:27:17] <DancesWitBalrog> how fast can you hoof it in this game?
[1:27:18] <teefpal> With that run speed I bet they'll be a FPS sequence like witchwood
[1:27:19] <%Felhad> must stay alan wake
[1:27:21] <TheeRabbi> This game feels like a horror version of Stanley Parable

[1:28:39] <TheHeroAppears> hmm
[1:28:39] <TheeRabbi> If Pat's ability mto recognize important things in games is any indicator, he's likely 100% wrong about whether the dog has to shit or not
[1:28:42] <+Hexidimentional> impossible space~
[1:28:44] <%boggsz12> rorshack
[1:28:44] <dukenux> more like Waiting Hell

[1:51:14] <DancesWitBalrog> supermarket racketeering?? OMGGG
[1:51:25] <%Felhad> This whole game is just Desmond being sad the Whole Foods shut down
[1:51:35] <dds333a> Supermarkets DESTROYING the mom and pops :(
[1:51:35] <%discoinfierno> Her voice acting is so much better than the rest, weird
[1:51:40] <%TheHateFish> Minor inconveniences being blown out of proportion in terms of personal wellbeing?
[1:51:43] <%Shonen_hero> I mean, if like, all there is a Walmart because they killed all the Mom and Pop shops I guess I can see why you'd be sad
[1:51:47] <%Shonen_hero> because that does happen
[1:51:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> If I lost my Favorite Burger Place I'd shit
[1:51:54] <+Hexidimentional> but you guys have the slimiest dog
[1:51:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Then there‚Äôs times you get happy a shitty mom and pop store closes down
[1:51:56] <DancesWitBalrog> Amazon killing the mom and pop shops
[1:51:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> huehuehue
[1:51:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> weeeeeee
[1:52:00] <@Ranryu692> some asshole didn't return their cart
[1:52:01] <%SpareKeese> It would make more sense if HER FAMILY owned the store
[1:52:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> A lot of places i supported closed down because of Covid. Shit sucked
[1:52:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> doc_ock_rokc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 37 months! Bro is getting married but he is driving everyone up the wall lets hope mah doesn't strangle him before the wedding.
[1:52:09] <%Shonen_hero> and it guts towns when the place that destroyed all the local businesses fails
[1:52:09] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:52:10] <BarnYardFiddler> As long as I have in n out
[1:52:14] <MaybeFalco> sick, cart drifting
[1:52:15] <%SpareKeese> Or if SHE owned the sstore
[1:52:18] <Spagheddies> No cheevos, unfortunately.
[1:52:21] <Profmcstevie> Supermarkets do just move to a town to destroy the local retail
[1:52:23] <TheeRabbi> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
[1:52:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man, I've lost so many of my favorite plaes to get food
[1:52:25] <dds333a> Anyway, yes, this is an issue
[1:52:27] <teefpal> I guess if someone has a really fragile emotional state, losing that connection could be devastating
[1:52:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> places, fuck
[1:52:31] <thatdudenamedlogan> Agoraphobia?
[1:52:40] <+Kyma1020> Agoraphobic?
[1:52:43] <+Hexidimentional> sounds more like anxiety
[1:52:44] <teefpal> What if she got assaulted and this is her way of coping?
[1:52:45] <dds333a> Oh boy LUL
[1:52:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this is Agoraphobia
[1:52:55] <DancesWitBalrog> YOOO THATS COOL
[1:52:59] <%twistedj3ster> Oh
[1:53:00] <nomolomo> am i seriously listening to a woman cry and moan about a super market inside a video game?
[1:53:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> This Therapist may have made a penis oopsie with his patients
[1:53:02] <DancesWitBalrog> giant tape
[1:53:05] <%Ziegsy> could also be sociophobia (?)
[1:53:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember your Dying Light 2 skills
[1:53:20] <%boggsz12> why are these two characters speaking normally when the rest of the va has been so fucking odd up to now
[1:53:22] <dds333a> This is going places
[1:53:26] <+Hexidimentional> you cant spell the rapist without therapist
[1:53:27] <TheeRabbi> You banged an agoraphobic patient in her safety bed
[1:53:31] <%twistedj3ster> I think that's way off
[1:53:32] <%SpareKeese> Agoraphobia would make sense for this, maybe
[1:53:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm not getting that either Pat
[1:53:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just a little bit of accitental penor
[1:53:36] <%Ra_Ra_Ra_RandomHero> Ra_Ra_Ra_RandomHero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:53:41] <%SpareKeese> .......?
[1:53:44] <dds333a> Desmond always has the same voice
[1:53:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> accidental penor
[1:53:50] <thatdudenamedlogan> We'll bang okay
[1:53:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I think he just feels guilty for not helping her
[1:53:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oops all dick
[1:54:00] <cowboy_plague_doctor> not the homa mart
[1:54:04] <%Shonen_hero> okay um, maybe it is a penis oopsie I'unno
[1:54:08] <Mattais88> Still a better name than Rona right now
[1:54:10] <Profmcstevie> Shoot at the mart, destroy the means
[1:54:11] <%SpareKeese> Did she get killed when she went somewhere else....?
[1:54:11] <%HotMafia81> @TurtlesAndTentacles ^^This
[1:54:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Helping her with his dong
[1:54:21] <%Ziegsy> Or she did

[1:54:27] <Spagheddies> You'll see.
[1:54:28] <TheeRabbi> He tried to help her with his penis. duh
[1:54:34] <dds333a> That's why Pete is blaming him LUL

[1:54:48] <nomolomo> damn, outed
[1:54:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> Looks like the market from Gears 3
[1:54:49] <+Hexidimentional> seems like he treated her female hysteria, with his dong
[1:54:50] <+Kyma1020> The sins could be that he didn't do enough and she unalived herself?
[1:54:52] <%SpareKeese> Not the dreded walmar
[1:54:59] <%discoinfierno> Pat returning to his personal Silent Hill: working retail
[1:55:05] <%Shonen_hero> I mean, sleeping with your patient is bad but not like... illegal is it? It's not like a student teacher relationship or like a cop dating someone they arrested
[1:55:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> How did the plumber get hurt on the job? He broke his dick in some guy's wife!
[1:55:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @hotmafia81  üí™üèæ

[2:01:23] <%Shonen_hero> huh, all the birds at our Walmart are only in the parking lot, the put like anti bird perching crap on the building to keep birds off the building
[2:01:25] <Rionxgarland> he reads but the information does not get stored in his brain
[2:01:26] <%HotSauceFiend> she doesnt want people watching her but she is called the watcher?
[2:01:27] <%Shonen_hero> which is kinda shitty
[2:01:27] <dds333a> Repeat LUL
[2:01:28] <cowboy_plague_doctor> so uh... is there like a health indicator?
[2:01:29] <Codofwisdom> She doesn't like you looking at her

[2:01:38] <Spagheddies> Hm, she's not dying. Why could that be...?
[2:01:39] <%Felhad> Leave her alone
[2:01:40] <dds333a> RIP
[2:01:40] <+PMAvers> There was a "lead the Watcher to the mirrors" thing that popped up when you got her the first time.
[2:01:41] <jorkoal> she's not dying because you're not hitting LUL
[2:01:45] <teefpal> @HotSauceFiend Curious.
[2:01:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> You gotta hit it from the Back
[2:01:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> look at her from over your shoulder
[2:01:47] <MaybeFalco> pat immediately forgets what the note said
[2:01:48] <+tylerpyre> stop looking at her jerk
[2:01:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat & Paige are MADE for each other Kappa
[2:01:54] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> if has to be the mirror, they said stop watching them
[2:01:54] <Mohawk_Sandwich> you need ghost bullets dood
[2:01:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @cowboy_plague_doctor Maybe Pat's face is covering it?
[2:02:14] <Rionxgarland> nono the game told him what to do let him suffer
[2:02:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Lost af
[2:02:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> csbeastSetIn BIG BRAIN csbeastSetIn
[2:02:42] <DancesWitBalrog> turning your back on the enemy is quite interesting as a mechanic
[2:02:45] <Mohawk_Sandwich> big boy big brain
[2:02:46] <%Shonen_hero> just ask the nearest associate where the department is Kappa
[2:02:53] <%HotSauceFiend> dont you have a flashlght?
[2:02:56] <cowboy_plague_doctor> @CappuccinoGuil maybe so I reckon
[2:03:15] <%HotSauceFiend> ah so never use it you mean
[2:03:30] <Spagheddies> The flashlight has a limiter, so Pat will NEVER use it.
[2:03:30] <%barkon345> I wonder if she was murdered by a peeping tom
[2:03:32] <%epide> glad i get to see this i had wishlisted this awhile ago
[2:03:32] <Sunstalker> Man, it would suck if a vampire also attacked you now. D: No reflection
[2:03:56] <cowboy_plague_doctor> pat, now you're a casheir
[2:03:59] <+telomere1> He can‚Äôt use the flashlight now. What if he needs it later?
[2:04:09] <cowboy_plague_doctor> true horror
[2:04:16] <TheHeroAppears> that's some crazy promotion lol
[2:04:18] <DancesWitBalrog> Pat got promoted from bagger to cashier LUL
[2:04:20] <%Shonen_hero> are they getting paid in NFTs or crypto???
[2:04:22] <Spagheddies> M A T H
[2:04:22] <%HotSauceFiend> PAt welcome back to the grocery store
[2:04:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Ho-Mart Coint Kappa
[2:04:29] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you are working in a grocer again
[2:04:42] <DancesWitBalrog> you cant escape grocery retail, pat
[2:04:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> cryptocurrency grocery store, tag: psychological horror
[2:04:49] <%Felhad> If Timmy has 5 coins and Samantha has 3 coins, then who was phone?

[2:05:11] <HotSauceFiend> PAt where are you going, you have groceries to bag
[2:05:24] <DancesWitBalrog> pat, i know its your day off, but imma need you to come in
[2:05:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's a mirror, so it's always behind you it looks like
[2:05:30] <Spagheddies> In the demo, they didn't even have that lingering highlight, so the mirror was significantly less useful.
[2:05:35] <teefpal> It's not a joke, retail is a nightmare
[2:05:38] <%Shonen_hero> Pat where's the pet food aisle
[2:05:44] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I'm surprised Pat isn't going into some Winter Soldier event when he entered the grocery store.

[2:08:59] <teefpal> What a nice purple guy
[2:08:59] <AngryAsian5> That was such a cute photo LUL
[2:09:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he looked like a cool dude
[2:09:03] <nomolomo> didnt condemned do that one as well?
[2:09:05] <@Ranryu692> was it supposed to scare you? he was giving you bunny ears psaLol
[2:09:11] <%Dementedpenguin> No.
[2:09:11] <Bl4kDynamite> He's obviously your friend. Only friends do the bunny ears
[2:09:14] <%Shonen_hero> working retail is spooky
[2:09:14] <+Romuken> Vivo
[2:09:15] <+Ne0nF0xx> ghost photo bomb
[2:09:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Scutie
[2:09:17] <teefpal> Not at all, he was a dapper lil guy
[2:09:18] <%maskofmichael> @teefpal He looked blue to me
[2:09:18] <%DEETRz> it was kinda funny
[2:09:18] <TheHeroAppears> it being a drawn photo kind takes you out of it
[2:09:19] <%Dementedpenguin> It was more silly than anything else LUL
[2:09:22] <%epide> it was like a spooky firend
[2:09:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> bro monster giving you bunny ears and dropping some detectynol or you
[2:09:32] <HotSauceFiend> Pat the watcher is in the store again, can you get the broom
[2:09:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @DancesWitBalrog You can go ahead and begin slobbing on my nob, i'll let you know when it's done and then you can go ahead with that charge Kappa
[2:09:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hey Pat I know its your day off but we're pretty short staffed
[2:09:39] <%HotMafia81> That felt intentionally silly
[2:09:43] <%chance_h> I like the scary music ambiance of the monster. This game blends things really nicely
[2:09:44] <%Shonen_hero> it was like Spooky from House of Jumpscares
[2:09:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> especially with the art style
[2:10:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I thought it was spooky.
[2:10:14] <teefpal> Why dont you have a reflection
[2:10:15] <%Shonen_hero> all joking aside, this game's aesthetic is actually kinda fun
[2:10:23] <+Hexidimentional> gotta lure her to it
[2:10:26] <Bl4kDynamite> Pretty sure she has to break it
[2:10:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat is a vampire
[2:10:28] <%Shonen_hero> I like the reflection mechanic
[2:10:34] <%maskofmichael> Hey Pat how's it feel fighting all these blue ghost?
[2:10:37] <%banjostevens> mirror the mirror!
[2:10:38] <%Felhad> u r the real ghosts, john
[2:10:39] <DancesWitBalrog> MC isnt human
[2:11:03] <@Ranryu692> just in case you hadn't figured it out I guess
[2:11:06] <%chance_h> Jorge
[2:11:07] <cowboy_plague_doctor> spoopy mannequins
[2:11:12] <teefpal> Vampire therapist murders sad ghosts
[2:11:15] <DancesWitBalrog> the mannequins goona attack you if you solve this puzzle?
[2:11:20] <+CherteuseKapibara> too advanced for rtx
[2:11:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> can't huehue a huehuehue
[2:11:27] <Dunmarkh> feel?
[2:11:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Feel"
[2:11:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh
[2:12:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Vampire therapist did a penis oopsie woopsie with his ghost patient
[2:12:02] <%HotMafia81> A recursive reflection would 10% crash the game
[2:12:14] <%HotMafia81> **100%
[2:12:15] <%Cozy90> sounds like she say KIBLAH instead of enough
[2:12:24] <Mildly_Eccentric> you see first pat hears and THEN he sees. like a bat
[2:12:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Because you're and evil ghost, lady?
[2:12:55] <DancesWitBalrog> 3 left? a lil too much imo
[2:12:57] <Mattais88> The Nestine Consiousness
[2:13:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> She must be a fan  of that Micheal Jackson song Leave Me Alone
[2:13:29] <%Shonen_hero> I'd like to think she's a neuro divergent ghost then an evil ghost. It's the polite term
[2:13:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Mildly_Eccentric Oh! So like Paige and he butt-hole echo location?
[2:13:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> her*
[2:13:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whose gonna Itemize all the returns
[2:14:10] <akitanito> is that a printer causing the electric arc
[2:14:10] <%Fefe41> Hey Pat we caught a kid licking ice creams and putting them back in the freezer, we'll need you to check every item in the aisle to see if they were tampered with
[2:14:15] <akitanito> jesus HP
[2:14:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> no signal...ON A LAND LINE?
[2:14:28] <HotSauceFiend> wow that glass went through wood?
[2:14:32] <tmo2814> is this one of those spooky games where you cam't fight back?
[2:14:37] <cowboy_plague_doctor> the word battery has been forever ruined by old let's plays.  It's always BAH TER REY
[2:14:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> @Fefe41 Why
[2:14:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Fefe41 Via taste testing and waiting 2 weeks right?
[2:15:07] <%Shonen_hero> I mean sort of, you have a gun, but nothing obvious to shoot at
[2:15:24] <cowboy_plague_doctor> howdy
[2:15:28] <%Shonen_hero> retail is a school in mental endurance
[2:15:33] <churropoppa> somebody was into P.T.
[2:15:39] <DancesWitBalrog> monkaS wtf
[2:15:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Eat one spoonful of each of these if you don't end up sick, the batch is safe
[2:15:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> she was 25. Pete is just judging the main character for not helping.
[2:15:45] <akitanito> does your character have a scar fetish
[2:15:46] <Bl4kDynamite> They're very sexy scars?

[2:16:05] <%Dementedpenguin> >:(
[2:16:07] <akitanito> nice handwriting
[2:16:12] <+Double_Tap_That> So is this game have actual supernatural stuff or is it one of those "it's an analogue for guilt, mental illness, etc." type deals?
[2:16:17] <%Shonen_hero> EMPLOYEES STEAL SHIT ALL THE TIME
[2:16:19] <cowboy_plague_doctor> how am I going to shit bricks if the vending machine is all shocky
[2:16:30] <%Shonen_hero> it's like, the most common form of theft in grocery stores
[2:16:37] <HotSauceFiend> If you didnt steal shit in a store you werent working right
[2:16:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I worked at a buffet 13 years ago in Quebec, we called ourselves "THE THROUGH"
[2:16:46] <%HotMafia81> Fuck you Dave, I wanna steal
[2:16:55] <Bl4kDynamite> Give you that SOMA vision

[2:16:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> nicely done sir
[2:17:00] <DancesWitBalrog> i remember when i worked in grocery retail, our manager threaten to install cameras in the bathroom even tho thats super illegal
[2:17:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @Double_Tap_That From what I remember from the demo, it's implied someone is doing something to the town. There is some bullshit happening for sure, but maybe not everything.
[2:17:03] <Mattais88> Did that ghost just expolde into confetti/
[2:17:17] <%twistedj3ster> just brute force it
[2:17:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fucking awful customers

[2:20:55] <akitanito> except for that one guy
[2:20:59] <%Dementedpenguin> sipsipDab
[2:21:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> i didn't help but im taking the compliment anyway :)
[2:21:00] <+Double_Tap_That> Thanks woolieONEGUY
[2:21:01] <MaybeFalco> smort
[2:21:03] <%banjostevens> till we are wrong
[2:21:07] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> woolieONEGUY
[2:21:07] <@Ranryu692> you did 4512 first attempt
[2:21:09] <%RetroCop87> this is how you unlock Vincent
[2:21:11] <%HotMafia81> That's kinda cool
[2:21:15] <%maskofmichael> Pat is smart in other ways, just not the good kind of ways
[2:21:21] <Bl4kDynamite> Grabbin' oills
[2:21:23] <+PMAvers> And the safe is full of drugs.
[2:21:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> REFECTION TIME
[2:21:53] <Spagheddies> Those were all pills, Pat.
[2:21:54] <CappuccinoGuil> I think if you used the mirror, it would've shown the pills in the safe
[2:22:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> that bitch
[2:22:03] <cowboy_plague_doctor> sneaky boy
[2:22:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just like that DMC3  puzzle right? Woolie doesn't have to give you the real answer?
[2:22:14] <@Ranryu692> this game is too spoopy
[2:22:17] <CappuccinoGuil> It was a clue for what was inside the safe
[2:22:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 423?
[2:22:30] <%Fooguwu> it contains papers about capitalism
[2:22:33] <%HotMafia81> Sneaky lad
[2:22:36] <%maskofmichael> that's where they put the farts
[2:22:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> huehueUE
[2:22:43] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> ztbGun
[2:22:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> SHOOT DA DEMON
[2:22:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Store Owner was hopped up on pills, probably caused paranoia.
[2:22:51] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> no floor or ceiling check
[2:22:52] <+Double_Tap_That> The best jump scares are the ones that just quietly appear.
[2:23:00] <Profmcstevie> A gentle walk backwards and a gun
[2:23:01] <%HotMafia81> Those are where the stinky files are kept
[2:23:01] <%Ziegsy> I, too, like to file my farts for future reference
[2:23:08] <wqorst> the head bob is goofy
[2:23:08] <fistynopunches> they dont have a good running 2
[2:23:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> the music for them is kind of anti spooky
[2:23:16] <cowboy_plague_doctor> They brought spoops to a gunfight
[2:23:23] <%twistedj3ster> and his dick is out
[2:23:35] <Profmcstevie> Loud noises scare younger minds
[2:23:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt What about the ones where you looking at the scene and something you overlooked just starts moving

[2:33:27] <+Double_Tap_That> @Fuggins4U No, because you can actually do things in this game.

[2:36:23] <%HotMafia81> I love him
[2:36:24] <%Cozy90> he lie
[2:36:25] <dan_g_v> smart6boyo
[2:36:26] <%Arweynn> dog up stupid
[2:36:26] <susukouhai> He fucking RAN
[2:36:30] <%twistedj3ster> do the best piss
[2:36:31] <+happythetic> Thanks
[2:36:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> My mah's dog learned the names of rooms so he can easily find his toys when we say they are in X room
[2:37:12] <%maskofmichael> I was gone for some minutes What Happen?
[2:37:12] <%Shonen_hero> it sounds like every time you try to get him to do a trick. He clearly understands you want him to do the trick, probably even knows which one, but he will never budge until there is a food incentive
[2:37:20] <+happythetic> That's pretty sick doc ngl
[2:37:31] <%Shonen_hero> Pat realized he hated retail and left
[2:37:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> I had a poodle who learned how to roll down windows...we had to turn on child guard when she was in the car
[2:38:03] <%maskofmichael> @Shonen_hero Wait you can LEAVE?
[2:38:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> Gief is a Shrewd business man
[2:38:21] <cowboy_plague_doctor> these are cool things for dogs to learn.  Mine learned how to open doors and go outside
[2:38:26] <%Shonen_hero> you can, but you won't get unemployment
[2:38:27] <cowboy_plague_doctor> not as cool
[2:38:28] <DancesWitBalrog> I cant believe Billy Kane is getting his ass beat by trash pandas in saltybet
[2:39:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> My brother's old dog learned how to say "outside" in english all on his own... he was a border colie corgi
[2:39:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> It was freaky the first time he did it
[2:39:38] <cowboy_plague_doctor> uh what
[2:39:48] <%Shonen_hero> you could make a completely not real match up and so long as you told me it was Saltybet I'd be hard pressed not to believe you
[2:39:55] <cowboy_plague_doctor> so the dog wasn't taught, just learned?
[2:40:03] <%Fooguwu> my dog is also half border collie and is crazy smart
[2:40:04] <cowboy_plague_doctor> that's kind of incredible
[2:40:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah
[2:40:06] <Profmcstevie> Mimicking it's owners speech is pretty simple for a dog
[2:40:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> He mimiced the noises
[2:40:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> He learned 4 words before he went deaf
[2:40:29] <cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah mine tries but it just sounds funny
[2:40:34] <Profmcstevie> My cat knows hello, the general inflection of it
[2:40:36] <FievelFails> Wierd my dog only ever knew how to speak latin backwards
[2:40:38] <cowboy_plague_doctor> aw
[2:40:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Outside, No, Now and food
[2:41:02] <cowboy_plague_doctor> lol the most important for a dog
[2:41:11] <Profmcstevie> Hel-lo, a low and a high squeak HahaCat
[2:41:13] <Mattais88> Mine old dog used to sing in tune with my saxophone when I practised
[2:41:22] <%Shonen_hero> Border collies, german shepherds, australian shepherds and even huskies are all scary smart dogs. They have the emotional intelligence and reasoning of a three year old human child
[2:41:27] <$joylent_blue> the idea of a dog just going "No" is hilarious to me
[2:41:36] <akitanito> what was that
[2:41:41] <FievelFails> I shouldve tried to train my dog to say  ruh roh
[2:41:44] <%Shonen_hero> D:
[2:41:46] <%twistedj3ster> awwww
[2:41:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> That's fair.
[2:41:48] <%Cozy90> YES
[2:41:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @joylent_blue he was an old man when he learned that

[2:56:59] <dds333a> @maskofmichael hell, two of the bosses are women, she'll do great LUL
[2:57:05] <%marvel877> There was that one time in the comics Batman and Bane were half brothers.
[2:57:09] <+GemeSvev> yo the old boy hallway
[2:57:10] <cowboy_plague_doctor> could have been worse indeed
[2:57:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> and you made it out without a knife in the back, huzza!
[2:57:15] <%twistedj3ster> @Pookiedaexzile And Terry iirc
[2:57:18] <%marvel877> *thought
[2:57:20] <+Hexidimentional> that man was on the phone pat gosh
[2:57:20] <user_naim> How much Sifu did I miss guys?
[2:57:29] <dds333a> @marvel877 I am so glad somebody else remembers this
[2:57:33] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> He just started
[2:57:33] <Profmcstevie> like 5 minutes
[2:57:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> @twistedj3ster That's the clone
[2:57:37] <akitanito> barely any
[2:57:37] <%Dementedpenguin> @user_naim 2 minutes?
[2:57:38] <Ell1ot> he just started
[2:57:38] <%RetroCop87> There are two types of Sifu fans: those who get super pissed when someone says it has Arkham combat, and those who excel at Arkham combat
[2:57:38] <Profmcstevie> max
[2:57:39] <%marvel877> barely fired it up tonight
[2:57:39] <dds333a> just started, so nothing
[2:57:41] <%sniffy77> pat just started
[2:57:46] <user_naim> cool thanks guys
[2:57:56] <+WiredBall> does anyone know if pat has every played evil within?
[2:57:57] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you can do it
[2:58:01] <gentlemanboxer> Sifu rist are unisex
[2:58:10] <%Fooguwu> As a woman I'm happy there are lots of women enemies
[2:58:12] <cowboy_plague_doctor> kill that mans
[2:58:13] <+Hexidimentional> @WiredBall he did it with the best friends
[2:58:14] <dds333a> He played both on the channel
[2:58:19] <Profmcstevie> Evil Within 1 and 2 are in Pats repertoire yes
[2:58:25] <%Dementedpenguin> @WiredBall He played the second game too
[2:58:26] <dds333a> Most likely in his own time as well
[2:58:26] <DancesWitBalrog> @wiredball yeah, check the old channel
[2:58:39] <+TopTieramisu> shadow grunts die twice
[2:58:42] <Ell1ot> did you punch him in the nuts?
[2:58:44] <+WiredBall> @everyone tyty
[2:58:49] <%marvel877> I'd really like to play this if I was allowed to even find a PS5. "Its also on PS4." YEP I'D LIKE TO PLAY ON PS5.
[2:58:56] <+vaderxyz1970> @fooguwu Equal opportunity ass whooping
[2:59:08] <+Hexidimentional> @marvel877 look at you with a ps5, MUST BE NICE
[2:59:09] <gentlemanboxer> 20 year old no deathless run bawkHyper
[2:59:13] <bakkatohri> Hey pat how's that Triangle + Box Quick claw attack treating you (if applicable). I found switching L2/R2 with box and triangle helps a lot
[2:59:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Damn Pat
[2:59:23] <user_naim> Slide kick is sick
[2:59:23] <Profmcstevie> Unlocking All Skills achievements gonna be a mark of shame huh bepNyo
[2:59:28] <dds333a> @marvel877 look man, you take what you can get Kappa
[2:59:37] <dds333a> Gonna have to settle for PS4 Kappa
[2:59:40] <%Fooguwu> Health recovery seems vital
[2:59:42] <akitanito> structure just seems very good
[2:59:45] <penitentpendant> Can't buy what you can't afford. Probably why it's score locked.
[2:59:57] <bakkatohri> @Profmcstevie Not at all. IF anything, having the movelist locked like that is just artificial difficulty
[2:59:59] <user_naim> true
[3:00:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> I mean, I think the Structure regain's probably the best.
[3:00:08] <@Ranryu692> if what you've been doing hasn't been working, try something new
[3:00:12] <+Hexidimentional> i think that lady was the maid pat
[3:00:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:00:24] <DancesWitBalrog> big boi
[3:00:31] <akitanito> I like how you always finish with a slap
[3:00:37] <%marvel877> @dds333a I have the money, but the bots keep sniping every attempt to purchase
[3:00:55] <masterp1e> don't forget to taunt so u can increase that multiplier faster
[3:01:01] <cowboy_plague_doctor> dude this guy didn't stand a chance
[3:01:12] <akitanito> do it during stun for more score
[3:01:15] <Profmcstevie> someday one of these martial arts games is gonna be a brutalistic fighting style that rips out eyes and it's gonna be ra
[3:01:16] <cowboy_plague_doctor> no taunt no death run
[3:01:20] <dds333a> @marvel877 in the same boat, and I've given up. I do feel for you.
[3:01:28] <Afterman_> the taunt gives so much xp too
[3:01:29] <bakkatohri> Switching Box/Triangle with L2/R2 is really good for using quick claw with imo. It's hard pressing those buttons in rapid succession for me.
[3:01:30] <Ell1ot> was that guy just taking a piss?
[3:01:30] <Afterman_> its nice
[3:01:33] <masterp1e> ur welcome sethorSpy
[3:01:38] <+CapnClassix> This reminds me of Sleeping Dogs combat
[3:01:47] <akitanito> aw man, you knocked off her mask
[3:01:50] <%Fooguwu> knocked her mask off! not covid safe D:
[3:02:07] <cowboy_plague_doctor> doggo
[3:02:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> The Evade button is crucial
[3:02:10] <user_naim> structure regain helps a shit ton with stuff like the second boss. so i agree with pat on the red shrine upgrades
[3:02:15] <cowboy_plague_doctor> oh..
[3:02:23] <%maskofmichael> psaDogchamp
[3:02:35] <+vaderxyz1970> @fooguwu the twist is that purple mist cures covid
[3:02:58] <%maskofmichael> I do like how he holds his one handed weapons
[3:03:23] <+Queen_Grimlock> backward grips FUCK
[3:03:28] <cowboy_plague_doctor> rub that dog's butt
[3:03:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> This Jade Empire Reboot fucking slaps
[3:03:38] <user_naim> pat‚Äôs killing it
[3:03:47] <%luftraumm1> he holds his weapons like a Dao blade
[3:03:57] <+vaderxyz1970> @pookiedaexzile and punches
[3:03:58] <+Hexidimentional> you jinxed him
[3:04:07] <bakkatohri> Feels sadge when you find the buffed guy first before clearing everybody else out ngl
[3:04:07] <cowboy_plague_doctor> those are still brutal punch lazer animations
[3:04:15] <gentlemanboxer> Lucky Ted's revenge
[3:04:20] <akitanito> oof
[3:04:21] <%sniffy77> what a combo
[3:04:22] <eustine> nice sweep
[3:04:24] <gunstars20> Ow
[3:04:25] <zerointelligence000> tag combo
[3:04:25] <DancesWitBalrog> wombo combo
[3:04:28] <+happythetic> oof
[3:04:28] <penitentpendant> Don't tilt~
[3:04:31] <akitanito> run over!
[3:04:35] <+Queen_Grimlock> OH SHIT, THE FIRST DEATH
[3:04:39] <gunstars20> Tragic
[3:04:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Now you can drink
[3:04:49] <zerointelligence000> how far has Pat gotten overall?
[3:04:51] <TrashMammalVEVO> You must enjoy the taste of the feet
[3:04:58] <+Hexidimentional> now you can just show id to get into the club
[3:05:05] <bakkatohri> There's an option to restart the level from the menu there. I honestly never knew it existed when I was playing it earlier :V
[3:05:29] <Aussie_Manny> En garde. I'll let you try my Crazy Talk style. khadBonk
[3:05:33] <%sniffy77> is that the chinese marijuana
[3:05:35] <gentlemanboxer> Imagine a Jackie Chan mod
[3:05:36] <%RetroCop87> Get some help
[3:05:36] <+happythetic> The flow state for this game must be intense. I forget to breathe just watching it
[3:05:36] <user_naim> @hexidimentional but is he on the LIST
[3:05:52] <+UltraViolet371> the Triangle + Circle finisher prompt makes me want Ghomorra to come out and start a bonus point QTE
[3:05:53] <bakkatohri> Ramen? Don't you mean Chinese spaghetti
[3:05:55] <%SpontaneousC> Parry timing seems so insistent but maybe I'm just really blind
[3:06:04] <user_naim> alright watch fajar get fucking wrecked
[3:06:07] <Aussie_Manny> Oh no, Pat nearly missed a workbench again!
[3:06:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> THere's already a John Wick Mod for this
[3:06:09] <DancesWitBalrog> the 3rd level is my favorite
[3:06:17] <dds333a> LUL
[3:06:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> Defeat the drug wizard
[3:06:21] <masterp1e> that fakeout knee slap is brutal gigast1Bcoomer
[3:06:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> Really? Because I found it really easy on my side.
[3:06:28] <Saltmeisterr> hey chat how was in sound mind?
[3:06:44] <gunstars20> LUL
[3:06:47] <%RetroCop87> BALL BUSTAH

[3:06:55] <akitanito> that's a weird eye strike
[3:06:57] <Profmcstevie> The ol eyepoke ball bust skip
[3:06:58] <penitentpendant> Dumping meter into the midair ball buster
[3:07:02] <%Arancet> meh
[3:07:04] <teefpal> @Saltmeisterr the jumpscares were friendly
[3:07:07] <gentlemanboxer> Drug Wizard bawkFace
[3:07:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Puhff we never had a sound mind
[3:07:12] <bakkatohri> Those were some solid blocks
[3:07:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @Saltmeisterr had some neat things going for it and some cool moments, but not really pat's vibe, I'd say
[3:07:19] <%terry_irvin> SOLID
[3:07:19] <%DianaTheAscian> Wow Pats gotten good at this
[3:07:22] <cowboy_plague_doctor> got em
[3:07:41] <user_naim> even without the throws pat‚Äôs destroying him
[3:07:44] <%sniffy77> pat im already seeing age 20 runs of the game
[3:07:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He is beginning to believe
[3:07:48] <+Hexidimentional> its a murderhobo
[3:08:10] <Ell1ot> hit him with your face to foot style
[3:08:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I wonder if they took the poise meter idea from Sekiro
[3:08:13] <cowboy_plague_doctor> very murderhobo
[3:08:16] <bakkatohri> @sniffy77 It's bullshit that people are so good at this game when it just came out and I'm just struggling to beat the 2nd level at Age 20
[3:08:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mad Dog of Raid Fame
[3:08:22] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> psaBig psaBig psaBig psaOrb psaOrb psaOrb
[3:08:31] <+PARARScs> bro was dialed in
[3:08:31] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> magic murder hobo herbalist.
[3:08:31] <cowboy_plague_doctor> damn...
[3:08:35] <penitentpendant> Dem Homing Blows
[3:08:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @wizard_of_diamonds Sekiro isn't even the first to do it
[3:08:56] <user_naim> the trophy for killing him is ‚ÄùThe Assault‚Äù, so it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt know exactly how The Raid this is
[3:08:58] <susukouhai> So close
[3:09:00] <Shiibbae> wait is this a training montage disguised as a boss?
[3:09:02] <zerointelligence000> I appreciate catgirl fajar going "nya"
[3:09:16] <%Dementedpenguin> Nice.
[3:09:18] <bakkatohri> Sekiro is a good game, but it's not as replayable as Dark Souls
[3:09:18] <gunstars20> There we go
[3:09:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @doc_ock_rokc That's not what I was asking, but I'll take your word for it
[3:09:24] <niffinbox> my balls to your fist style how'd ya like it
[3:09:29] <+Hexidimentional> he's been preparing since he was 12?
[3:09:31] <cowboy_plague_doctor> is there a point to sparing them?
[3:09:32] <zerointelligence000> wait how?
[3:09:33] <%Dova573> you gotta break their posture twice
[3:09:33] <Aussie_Manny> You can spare them?!?
[3:09:34] <+Hexidimentional> what did they fucking do to him
[3:09:37] <Profmcstevie> You go for health, not stamina to spare I think
[3:09:37] <Aussie_Manny> Whaaaaaaaa
[3:09:39] <%tetraes> tetraes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hope u enjoy Elden Ring
[3:09:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> @Hexidimentional Yes
[3:09:50] <+vaderxyz1970> whasa
[3:09:58] <$Wafflum> @Profmcstevie opposite
[3:09:59] <niffinbox> nah not hard just start blocking after the first bar break
[3:10:00] <zerointelligence000> oh shit that's cool
[3:10:04] <%Fooguwu> @Hexidimentional they killed his father then killed him (he got better) when he was 12
[3:10:04] <cowboy_plague_doctor> ooooo
[3:10:05] <%Dementedpenguin> @Hexidimentional have you seen Shenmue's opening? It's that except he was younger.
[3:10:07] <vonmaultke> Basically style on them till they break down
[3:10:08] <@DakotaMacDoodle> I've spared the first one but sean is really rough more me
[3:10:11] <%sniffy77> your character has probably killed a couple of minions with that metal pipe
[3:10:15] <Aussie_Manny> You have to parry over and over and over once they're 1 hp? Whoa...
[3:10:16] <dds333a> And there you go
[3:10:18] <%Dova573> It does feel like a thing to attempt after unloking all the skills
[3:10:19] <zerointelligence000> so you have to run the clock on them basically
[3:10:24] <+Double_Tap_That> @Hexidimentional More like 11, since they were revived with the talisman as a child.
[3:10:24] <Saltmeisterr> K I L L
[3:10:25] <penitentpendant> Murderhobo ending first, honorable ending later
[3:10:31] <PizzicatoFive5> how old can the guy get?
[3:10:33] <%maskofmichael> Only the biggest of heroes kill
[3:10:37] <Saltmeisterr> IM ON THE LIST
[3:10:38] <SomeAsianDood> @Aussie_Manny so long as you don't do the take down it's fine.
[3:10:40] <+Hexidimentional> @Dementedpenguin i doubt this has a manditory 3 day gotta work as a forklift driver section tho
[3:10:41] <cowboy_plague_doctor> sooo uh... kill them all and youtube the other ending?
[3:10:41] <bakkatohri> I wish this game had more moves ngl. Batman lets you execute multiple thugs at the same time, and so does Yakuza. But I get it. Game's still good.
[3:10:43] <teefpal> 60s-70s
[3:10:46] <masterp1e> K I L L gigast1Bcoomer
[3:10:47] <niffinbox> you can use soft block on them too doesnt even need to be perfect
[3:10:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PizzicatoFive5 75
[3:10:55] <gunstars20> Bodied
[3:10:56] <%Dementedpenguin> @Hexidimentional LUL
[3:11:03] <+vaderxyz1970> but why spare any of them they killed like all your friends and family
[3:11:12] <%Divryne> Always use the stationary dodges unless you need distance with the R2 dodge has been my goto tip.
[3:11:17] <dds333a> @cowboy_plague_doctor or vice-versa, or do them both LUL
[3:11:18] <user_naim> these dudes ain‚Äôt on the list no more
[3:11:18] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> liu  kang
[3:11:19] <masterp1e> ur taunt Pat btw
[3:11:27] <Profmcstevie> Murder is not the way of the fighting style he was taught
[3:11:27] <DancesWitBalrog> kill all the mobs but spare the bosses. good logic
[3:11:32] <Profmcstevie> but Murder is VERY FUN
[3:11:32] <Shiibbae> lets start a RAGER
[3:11:38] <wqorst> still slaps
[3:11:38] <penitentpendant> Speaking of Ball Buster
[3:11:44] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> this guy is the punisher, he's crazy
[3:11:45] <%sniffy77> NICE
[3:11:45] <SomeAsianDood> @PizzicatoFive5 if you die above 70 it's game over. But you can die below 70 and bleed over as far as 78 I think @doc_ock_rokc
[3:11:46] <dds333a> @vaderxyz1970 maybe someone doesn't want to, iunno
[3:11:48] <zerointelligence000> :O
[3:11:54] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> these people did nothing wrong
[3:12:03] <teefpal> Oh this is the level the devs dared game journos to no death run
[3:12:03] <%Fooguwu> YEYEYEYE
[3:12:04] <DancesWitBalrog> catJAM
[3:12:11] <gunstars20> YEEEE
[3:12:16] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> youre actually playing with the bad guy
[3:12:18] <+Hexidimentional> pretty sure they are all bystanders lmao
[3:12:18] <%Wallabri> sofieJAM sofieJAM sofieJAM
[3:12:19] <Ell1ot> show them the list, Pat
[3:12:27] <cowboy_plague_doctor> steal that man's dragon mask
[3:12:31] <$Wafflum> I never remember to use Focus moves, so I'll die like 4 times and get mad at myself
[3:12:36] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> they joined a bar fight instead of running out the door. they are all viable targets.
[3:12:37] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> completly innocent people
[3:12:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ll_J_A_C_K_ll They are ravers...they deserve it
[3:12:41] <%maskofmichael> the jojo secret technique
[3:12:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> OST low key pumpin tho
[3:12:45] <%Fooguwu> kickgirl > punchgirl
[3:12:46] <Profmcstevie> yeyeye, the battle technique of running to all the good environmental weapons
[3:12:48] <Charronia> Well, all the customers have been murdered. This is not going to be good for profits.
[3:12:49] <DancesWitBalrog> best character in the game is the DJ catJAM
[3:12:52] <%Cozy90> I love this SOR3 like music
[3:12:53] <susukouhai> I dont think any of them are bystanders, the place is supposed to be closed
[3:12:54] <cowboy_plague_doctor> nice!
[3:12:56] <SomeAsianDood> don't forget statue
[3:12:56] <Plughead_> don't forget the statue
[3:13:01] <BarnYardFiddler> catJAM
[3:13:05] <bakkatohri> A tip for anybody else playing this game right now: Quick claw is really good because you can use it immediately after blocking if you're holding the block button down. Like, you can even dodge and go into a quickclaw attack right away
[3:13:06] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> @ll_J_A_C_K_ll they are just chilling and enjoying their life man. not justified
[3:13:06] <cowboy_plague_doctor> don't forget to breath pat lol
[3:13:08] <joec182> m.
[3:13:11] <Aussie_Manny> Look at this mess! D:
[3:13:14] <Ell1ot> is it possible to fight the DJ or at least throw something at him?

[3:13:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @user_naim gotta worship the dance floor
[3:13:57] <Aussie_Manny> That was rude.
[3:13:57] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> wow man ..
[3:14:05] <bakkatohri> On this level, you can do the shortcut area on top of the usual way if you go the usual way first
[3:14:12] <%Fooguwu> @bassoontyphoon she could never play it though
[3:14:13] <bakkatohri> Can't do it on the first level though
[3:14:22] <+Hexidimentional> fucking bottle kids

[3:15:40] <%Fooguwu> yo get fucked

[3:18:49] <dds333a> @ll_j_a_c_k_ll indeed, but this is what revenge does. although the player could headcanon they don't give two shits
[3:18:56] <DancesWitBalrog> i wish there was a blood drunk mode - if you kill an amnount of enemies without taking damage, you get a devil trigger
[3:19:00] <zerointelligence000> I feel like the enemy battle lines have some meme potential

[3:24:46] <%SaiyanShoto> Now comes the hardest part of this level
[3:24:54] <+trackles_64> pokes eyes
[3:24:54] <niffinbox> heavy strike- palm strike- chasing trip kick- ground attack absolutely melts
[3:25:15] <Profmcstevie> Why...does he keep...punching me....in the eyes pattyRIP
[3:25:17] <+Romuken> bo-staff.  apply directly to the forehead
[3:25:18] <Daxalog> Dont forget to taunt when able
[3:25:27] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt did you see the news that they are planning free dlc for Sifu?
[3:25:33] <bakkatohri> Does taunting actually do anything in this game?
[3:25:35] <PizzicatoFive5> why doesn't he just run away to safety when the bar is about to fill up?
[3:25:39] <bakkatohri> @Saltmeisterr YOOOOO
[3:25:42] <Afterman_> these fuckers
[3:25:43] <Afterman_> are so hard
[3:25:48] <SomeAsianDood> boosts score multiplier @bakkatohri
[3:25:50] <cowboy_plague_doctor> oh nooo
[3:25:53] <Charronia> The true boss
[3:25:53] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> it's neat that this headband guy isn't quite a midboss on his own, but teamed up w/ his girlfriend he's much stronger.
[3:25:53] <+CookieCutter007> that delay is fucked up
[3:25:54] <user_naim> eye strike -> throw off ledge fucks these guys up, if you feel like cheesing
[3:26:03] <%SaiyanShoto> I always die to these two
[3:26:04] <DancesWitBalrog> at least you're only aging by 1
[3:26:09] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> man, at the end of the day,, this guy would be feeling so much muscular pain
[3:26:10] <cowboy_plague_doctor> this guy has some combos
[3:26:42] <%SaiyanShoto> I beat the game and to me those two are the hardest fight in the game
[3:26:44] <DancesWitBalrog> then the RNG have them sync combo you, i cant beat them
[3:26:57] <bakkatohri> Anybody remember that Heavy Rain glitch where the dude keeps screaming "SHAWN"
[3:27:03] <Afterman_> @PatStaresAt i think when you drop these staffs, they linger into the 2nd phase, so maybe try picking them all up and throwing them once? They disappear otherwise ive found
[3:27:06] <Plughead_> what's the furthest Pat's gotten?
[3:27:06] <Aussie_Manny> SEEAAAAAN 2020Snacking
[3:27:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just remember he's smoking this whole time
[3:27:11] <djblue_shift> god those clacks are so good
[3:27:26] <+trackles_64> My dodges never work
[3:27:35] <+Romuken> keeps palm-heel-striking me in the kidney!
[3:27:40] <SILENTBOB22> Guess its a bad time to be named Sean huh?
[3:27:49] <%RetroCop87> parry?
[3:27:53] <cowboy_plague_doctor> eh you got this
[3:27:57] <niffinbox> I may be wrong but I think the focus sweep kick does more structure dmg
[3:28:15] <DancesWitBalrog> i keep thinking Shang Chi when i hear Sean
[3:28:27] <SomeAsianDood> I think there's no diff. Sweep kick just disarms normies
[3:28:27] <bakkatohri> WARM UP LEGALIZE BLANCH
[3:28:28] <+trackles_64> Now lose all the weapons
[3:28:36] <%Divryne> The fire in the second phase doesn't actually do chip damage if you perfect parry his attacks.
[3:28:37] <Afterman_> @DancesWitBalrog  he honestly sounds like the one brother to the guy who played pennywise in the new movie
[3:28:50] <+vaderxyz1970> His 2nd phase intro is sooo cool
[3:28:51] <$Wafflum> I had Sean get stuck in a pillar in phase 1 the first time I beat him LUL
[3:28:52] <Hozak> Enough of your magic realism!
[3:29:11] <Afterman_> @DancesWitBalrog  alexander skarsgard is his name lol, i might be crazy but he sounds like him
[3:29:14] <+trackles_64> so glitchy lol
[3:29:17] <+CookieCutter007> LUL fuck his sweep
[3:29:23] <%sniffy77> thats a bug
[3:29:23] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> flames in a stick, give no tactal advantage whats so ever.....YOURE PRETTY GOOD
[3:29:24] <penitentpendant> Buggy
[3:29:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I always love doing the roundhouse kick then hitting them on the ground then eye strike then raining strikes and get them in a loop sometimes
[3:29:31] <square__1> wtf glitch punch his kidney
[3:29:37] <dds333a> hell sweeps LUL
[3:29:43] <%chance_h> Mind punch
[3:29:44] <+trackles_64> Where the QA testers at/?
[3:30:01] <Afterman_> @PatStaresAt try picking up all the staffs and throwing them at sean once, that should keep them from despawning in the 2nd phase, or it worked for one staff for me at least. might make it easier
[3:30:09] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> man,,,a sword on fire ,give no bonus damage whats so ever.....lol
[3:30:23] <$Wafflum> That's why Ground Parry is so important
[3:30:23] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:30:26] <%Divryne> The sweep is always happens when he charges or after the first punch after a charge.
[3:30:38] <user_naim> that ground parry tech seems like fun solution. i gotta steal that
[3:30:47] <%SaiyanShoto> I hate when he gets stuck in a loop where he keeps doing low then runs
[3:30:48] <Ell1ot> master eye poker
[3:30:52] <%Divryne> If you can't react to the sweep you can always perfect parry it too.
[3:30:58] <%Fooguwu> Does this mean we get to see the next level? Pwease?
[3:31:04] <@Ranryu692> nice!

[3:33:07] <bakkatohri> There are a lot of weapons on this stage that you can just use for free damage when you're kicking them around
[3:33:07] <%maskofmichael> white rooms existed before ME pat
[3:33:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Untouched!
[3:33:10] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> its time to chew gums and kick bubble gums
[3:33:13] <%Divryne> When I watched Woolie play he kept using the R2 dodge like a coward.
[3:33:15] <Profmcstevie> Sifus gonna be on Woolies "Best Games Not Of This Year" list in 2024
[3:33:15] <%sniffy77> so you're just straight up stabbing people now
[3:33:21] <toulon_somberjade> It took Woolie HOURS to get TO the club
[3:33:34] <Hozak> I like how the guards are armed with baseball bats
[3:33:54] <penitentpendant> Need EXP
[3:33:55] <cowboy_plague_doctor> hey they have a company team
[3:33:56] <%boggsz12> shrines?
[3:33:56] <%DianaTheAscian> that was just a normal dude
[3:33:59] <square__1> stabbing is the natural evolution of the rampage
[3:34:00] <%Logoth_> Is this mother fucker holding his bat like Starkiller??
[3:34:02] <niffinbox> you must be some fighter to get past my cow
[3:34:03] <user_naim> team fuck art in the house
[3:34:04] <penitentpendant> (Tho it's actually the shrines)
[3:34:08] <$Wafflum> It's a good thing no one invented guns in this game
[3:34:12] <%Divryne> I think you can use the Club shortcut and still get all the statues.
[3:34:12] <ErikFeral> sure is a good thing no one in this game has ever heard of a gun (so far as i know)
[3:34:13] <AngryAsian5> I love how even the old balding dude in a suit thinks he can take you. That's dedication.
[3:34:16] <StormSamurai8> Dodging is so important in this game, but they teach you it like it is only used to dodge throws from fat guys
[3:34:17] <DancesWitBalrog> nice
[3:34:18] <Daxalog> Are you supposed to taunt anyone here?
[3:34:19] <susukouhai> At least this isnt Yakuza and they just pull out guns
[3:34:24] <%VentWilsn> those guards with the baseball bats vs you with a sword have to hate their bosses
[3:34:26] <%Divryne> Unless you want a high score.
[3:34:32] <ErikFeral> seaaaaaaaaan!
[3:34:36] <%sniffy77> bruh he killed him
[3:34:40] <user_naim> first one coming up
[3:34:43] <%SaiyanShoto> There‚Äôs one at the very top of you go up the stairs I think
[3:34:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> throw light bulb
[3:34:44] <+jsleeze> 1 in the next room 1 on top floor
[3:34:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Dishonor how? LUL
[3:34:52] <dds333a> @angryasian5 I always respect the hustle

[3:34:55] <+Magmalefilme> POCKET SAND
[3:34:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Wow what a nice museum Im so glad I took time out of my busy schedule to BONK
[3:34:56] <penitentpendant> Hmm. I wonder if dialogue changes if you spare them.
[3:34:58] <bakkatohri> @susukouhai Kiryu is so badass he can bring people back from the dead after shooting them to death
[3:34:59] <user_naim> first shrine is after ink room
[3:34:59] <%W1nterTitan> That man is dead
[3:34:59] <gunstars20> LUL
[3:35:00] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That was brutal
[3:35:00] <+mans51> PogChamp
[3:35:01] <niffinbox> theres one on the top floor one before the boss and one
[3:35:04] <Aussie_Manny> "I'm suffering just listening to you talk." khadBonk
[3:35:06] <penitentpendant> That phrasing was actually fairly neutral
[3:35:09] <$Wafflum> @Daxalog If you're at x5 there is no need to taunt
[3:35:10] <+monfo_the_great> Those bat hits sound brutal. Man I'd hate to get whacked with one of those
[3:35:15] <%DianaTheAscian> that head stomp Jesus
[3:35:15] <akitanito> all those hanging pastel bags are throwables
[3:35:18] <cowboy_plague_doctor> okay can the pendulum kill them
[3:35:26] <SparkAfterDark> I love when he uses the wrong end of it
[3:35:34] <mackovoir> "damn he's good"
[3:35:35] <SomeAsianDood> yes @cowboy_plague_doctor
[3:35:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> All Beeaten
[3:35:43] <cowboy_plague_doctor> nice
[3:35:43] <%Divryne> How far has Pat gotten?
[3:35:43] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> she was just copying rogue's hair style whats so bad about it ? to deserve that beating
[3:35:44] <niffinbox> one in this room, one on top floor and one in boss room
[3:35:45] <Aussie_Manny> "Becky, don't compliment the enemy. Gahd!"
[3:35:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> i love that the bat gets all fucked up
[3:35:58] <+lumporr> how long until they just start pulling guns
[3:36:01] <bakkatohri> Devs: "This pendulum sure is cool sure would suck if most players ignored it."
[3:36:10] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> they are just following orders pat
[3:36:19] <%Fooguwu> @SparkAfterDark the handle of a bat is great for pokes and hooks
[3:36:25] <Hozak> He's gone all devil like in godhand
[3:36:27] <%boggsz12> damn they got the whole office to come fight you
[3:36:27] <+Queen_Grimlock> OH SHIT, BOSS MOOK
[3:36:32] <ErikFeral> Stairs seem like the WORST place to get in a fight on
[3:36:35] <+wiseaud> no deaths so far!
[3:36:39] <%VentWilsn> im still always shocked whenever one of them doesnt get killed by ur takedown
[3:36:58] <%maskofmichael> coward
[3:37:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @wiseaud psaCrazyhead psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace

[3:37:32] <teefpal> that is the most fragile art installation evert
[3:37:33] <%maskofmichael> no ballussy
[3:37:41] <niffinbox> killing is wrong and bad there should be a new stronger word for killing like badwrong or badong
[3:37:43] <+Deasmeister> Yeah I just relied on the eye poke into sword instant kill for her
[3:37:44] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> security protecting this museuum while this man is attacking everything. ..
[3:37:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat fighting 2 King Pins
[3:37:53] <%Divryne> I hate the fat grab
[3:37:58] <$Wafflum> When they stager the combos it's really tough to handle
[3:37:58] <%VentWilsn> THE ANCIENT SHOVE INTO HOOK COMBO
[3:37:59] <DancesWitBalrog> its always the synchronized combos
[3:38:04] <@Ranryu692> obviously we're a good influence
[3:38:06] <akitanito> oh god camera fuckery
[3:38:07] <%Valdorick> Why Pat? Why would you taunt your stand like that?

[3:38:46] <%AnthroMetal> batman
[3:38:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Nerves get the better of you?" she asks, watching you stab a man to death
[3:38:58] <penitentpendant> Come on and SLAM
[3:39:00] <bakkatohri> Some of the enemies in this game are really cute and I wish you could play as them

[3:41:00] <+Queen_Grimlock> become 30 years old: instantly kick ass

[3:41:05] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> no

[3:41:40] <Ell1ot> are you doing your taunts?
[3:41:42] <bakkatohri> Does the multiplier scale with your current score, too? Or is it just points you get from each enemy.
[3:41:44] <coreyyotto> this section's still pretty cool
[3:41:48] <niffinbox> its best to get first 2 pips on the earlier levels
[3:41:52] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> fighting bjorn

[3:42:34] <+Demerson13> SIFU NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[3:42:37] <DancesWitBalrog> sounds like something a water based boss would tell you in the boss fight
[3:42:38] <Saltmeisterr> BIG KILL
[3:42:39] <bakkatohri> It's okay to murder goons - they're not important to the plot
[3:42:45] <AngryAsian5> BIG DEAD
[3:42:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Be like water, and drown these fools
[3:42:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Cut his throat PogChamp
[3:42:48] <PizzicatoFive5> Sifu doesn't kill
[3:42:55] <PizzicatoFive5> is he even called Sifu
[3:42:58] <SparkAfterDark> I mean. You bring a knife, you shouldn't be surprised if it ends up in you.
[3:43:12] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> this guy should have zero energy to fight at this point . he needs food. rice. tea
[3:43:13] <+MisterAvry> At least one enemy per encounter should be like "holy fuck he just gutted three of us!" and leave
[3:43:19] <gentlemanboxer> Big boi
[3:43:32] <bakkatohri> leg sweeps op
[3:43:32] <penitentpendant> Things were done

[3:43:38] <mackovoir> capoeira'd
[3:43:39] <coreyyotto> owned
[3:43:50] <ToastyBroDude> Sometimes they do say stuff
[3:43:50] <+mans51> sleeping dogs did that right atleast
[3:43:52] <Plughead_> that bit with the 1 big guy and 2 dancers is still the fucking hardest enemy composition in the game, especially in this environment
[3:43:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> implement morale failures for enemies. squad broken
[3:44:00] <%Fooguwu> There was that one girl who gave up, and then you killed her
[3:44:03] <+Queen_Grimlock> oh they say that all the time
[3:44:04] <nzrai> "surely I can kill this man"
[3:44:13] <coreyyotto> tbf, are any of these mooks even real?
[3:44:13] <penitentpendant> I believe they just spammed it in the first level. So that future levels the mooks feel more 'professional/tough'
[3:44:15] <Charronia> "Oh shit it's the man with 10 lives limesD "
[3:44:15] <gentlemanboxer> Sifu becoming boomer

[3:44:20] <DancesWitBalrog> surely Clueless
[3:44:21] <mackovoir> not like this patrick
[3:44:22] <%VentWilsn> i remember in the bar there was one character that did that, thought it was a mechanic but guess it was scripted
[3:44:23] <PizzicatoFive5> wait, you can choose the MC's gender?
[3:44:25] <%cooldude69xx> Isn't there? In the club one of the dudes who gangs up on you with a bunch of guys
[3:44:25] <square__1> there was an enemy that was just impressed at how badly you were kicking there ass
[3:44:25] <user_naim> they just get hype. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs on fire‚Äù
[3:44:35] <+Double_Tap_That> @PizzicatoFive5 Yes
[3:44:35] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> "i'll get a gun ,wait here ""
[3:44:38] <%captain_thickthighs> the boomer rage makes you stronger
[3:44:38] <AngryAsian5> To be fair to the goons, they are killing you. You're just supernatural LUL
[3:44:41] <Whienzarth> So you age when you diie?
[3:44:41] <Mattais88> Where do all these people get thugs who know kung fu? Do they offer a disvount on classes?
[3:44:44] <+Queen_Grimlock> @user_naim IS IT THE SHOES?
[3:44:46] <+MooseyFate100> Doesn‚Äôt Last of Us 2 do that where the enemy sees that you‚Äôre hardcore and just goes ‚Äúnope‚Äù and runs away
[3:44:50] <cowboy_plague_doctor> wow these... art curators? kick ass?
[3:44:51] <DancesWitBalrog> i love this level design

[3:45:05] <stormhawk9891> LOSS!?

[3:45:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I find it kinda ridiculous that any artist would have THIS many body guards and random punks hanging out with her in a museum

[3:46:03] <+lumporr> fuck these are hard murders
[3:46:06] <Hozak> Is there any way to stop an enemy from going beast mode?
[3:46:17] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The ancient kung-fu technique, of stabbing someone
[3:46:19] <%VentWilsn> @MooseyFate100 wouldnt that just be a beat em up? Or a super long hallway?
[3:46:21] <%SaiyanShoto> That knife instakill helped a lot with sub bosses
[3:46:22] <+mans51> imagine if this game had blood
[3:46:24] <bakkatohri> @Hozak Don't use finishers on them
[3:46:25] <Aussie_Manny> f
[3:46:26] <niffinbox> you need to hold it for a second
[3:46:31] <+lumporr> man this is a huge incentive to never bring a knife to fight this guy
[3:46:33] <%Valdorick> Oh thank god, its all good, he's doing moves known non-killer Kiryu has done to people.
[3:46:37] <penitentpendant> @Hozak Not breaking their stamina and instead just depleting their HP
[3:46:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats COOL

[3:47:10] <cowboy_plague_doctor> the stages of geif?
[3:47:10] <teefpal> Imagine if this game has proper blood and gore
[3:47:14] <gentlemanboxer> Anger and or rage

[3:47:20] <%DianaTheAscian> wow that weapon durability is for real

[3:50:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Then good luck LUL
[3:50:35] <%maskofmichael> you punch them
[3:50:36] <cowboy_plague_doctor> dodge and punch I think
[3:50:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Punch the artist until she is dead
[3:50:37] <%Xelig> Run around her and go to her side, hit her after some combos
[3:50:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> HAve you tried Avoid

[3:50:50] <square__1> give to paige
[3:50:51] <user_naim> @saltmeisterr exactly
[3:50:52] <%VentWilsn> just use ur intelligence of a 30 year old
[3:50:54] <TrashMammalVEVO> do combo
[3:51:01] <+DrGasMax> You figure out how to dodge the highs and lows and pray she doesn't use the pattern you don't understand
[3:51:02] <Darkrenai> catJAM
[3:51:02] <niffinbox> bring a bat makes it easier for first phase
[3:51:02] <DancesWitBalrog> catJAM
[3:51:04] <+lumporr> oh nooooooo

[3:51:33] <%DianaTheAscian> oh damn
[3:51:35] <%Dova573> Look at this Kill bill stage

[3:51:58] <%Felhad> Tri-section staff
[3:52:00] <+Romuken> Twist her dick
[3:52:01] <%DianaTheAscian> wow back step attacks
[3:52:01] <%Fefe41> @MooseyFate100 three-section staff its a real wep
[3:52:01] <%SaiyanShoto> Dodging her is so tough cause she just goes wild
[3:52:06] <kiwicoffin> that's kinda the idea behind the weapon
[3:52:08] <+CookieCutter007> the mix ups
[3:52:08] <+MooseyFate100> Yeah punch her in the birth canal
[3:52:11] <%captain_thickthighs> Lady snow blood respect the classics!!!
[3:52:13] <+Queen_Grimlock> pat, you need to let your structure refill i trhink
[3:52:13] <user_naim> footsies motherfucker
[3:52:14] <+ALazo> time to memorize strings
[3:52:15] <%I_chose_Rapture> Holy shit she can dish damage
[3:52:17] <cowboy_plague_doctor> I mean that was good
[3:52:17] <%Divryne> Stay away and bait the final sweep after the 4-5 hit combo.
[3:52:19] <user_naim> sweet sweet neutral
[3:52:21] <@Ranryu692> give her the ol' clit twist
[3:52:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Is passivism a valid defense for murder?
[3:52:23] <%SaiyanShoto> I just rush her and sometimes she doesn‚Äôt know what to do LUL
[3:52:25] <%Fooguwu> I guess just never expect to dodge the same direction twice
[3:52:33] <user_naim> @ranryu692 nice
[3:52:42] <+lumporr> YEAYEAYEA
[3:52:44] <PizzicatoFive5> so why is this guy manhandling all these people, what's the plot?
[3:52:45] <mackovoir> remember the 3 Bs. Block, Bioware, and Blizzard.
[3:52:45] <SparkAfterDark> I think you gotta just learn her body language. No trick it's just real.
[3:52:47] <cowboy_plague_doctor> ye ye ye
[3:52:47] <penitentpendant> The opening credits claims she's weak to Palm Strike. Otherwise chat thinks weapons are the answer.
[3:52:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She seems to havge patterns of: Down, Up, Down, Up
[3:52:53] <Darkrenai> You're actually doing really well so far
[3:52:55] <%DianaTheAscian> lightbulb?
[3:52:56] <DancesWitBalrog> not bad, pat
[3:52:57] <%terry_irvin> GADDAMN
[3:52:57] <+Nzsc> He's LEARNING he's BELIEVING
[3:53:02] <Aussie_Manny> "Your crew ain't the only ones with freaky mystic powers, lady." markel6Fighton
[3:53:03] <+PortableBoredom> Good thing you help her up to her feet whenever you knock her down.
[3:53:05] <%SaiyanShoto> You can get her in some good loops
[3:53:07] <PizzicatoFive5> @Darkrenai jinxed
[3:53:09] <Ell1ot> Poking her eyes seem to work
[3:53:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> AVOID
[3:53:14] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He's beginning to believe
[3:53:14] <cowboy_plague_doctor> I think you got it though
[3:53:14] <+lumporr> it's always HLHL
[3:53:14] <niffinbox> sean teaches you to dodge but she teaches you to use forward and back dodge
[3:53:15] <%cooldude69xx> @PizzicatoFive5 killed his dad
[3:53:15] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> o-rin from blade of the immortal and o-rin from kill bill, double whammy
[3:53:22] <Sulliman34> ive found parrying works better than trying to dodge her stuff personally
[3:53:22] <bakkatohri> @mackovoir Block, Bodge, Bounter
[3:53:23] <kiwicoffin> pressure and fishing for sweeps is my go to
[3:53:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PatStaresAt I think her pattern is Down Up Down Up generally
[3:53:32] <Aussie_Manny> "I can do this all day." markel6Fighton
[3:53:39] <%Dementedpenguin> @PizzicatoFive5 student killed master, protag now goes on revenge streak, basically
[3:53:40] <%terry_irvin> GET IN
[3:53:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Though not always, clearly LUL
[3:53:47] <user_naim> time for hype
[3:53:48] <cowboy_plague_doctor> damn
[3:53:50] <+sunny_side_up> she has a different one for every combo
[3:53:54] <SparkAfterDark> It seems unfair that she gets a stick and you don't
[3:53:56] <CSeriesJTYPE> "ill try spinning, thats a good trick" - her, probably
[3:53:56] <DancesWitBalrog> the big 4 0
[3:54:00] <%captain_thickthighs> move around her
[3:54:01] <%cha0tic_klutch> Do you R2 till shes done?
[3:54:13] <DancesWitBalrog> stage 2 is a lot more easier than stage 1  imo
[3:54:19] <PizzicatoFive5> so what if you reach 75 years, do you just die and have to restart the whole game?
[3:54:22] <%DianaTheAscian> man's aged 8 years in front of her
[3:54:28] <cowboy_plague_doctor> oh don't do that
[3:54:29] <%VentWilsn> what, is the walls made outta icicles or something?
[3:54:30] <+lumporr> ducking into the knives
[3:54:31] <niffinbox> if you bring a bat you can mitigate chip damage
[3:54:35] <Onamar> @PizzicatoFive5 You can redo individual stages
[3:54:36] <teefpal> @PizzicatoFive5 Yes
[3:54:36] <cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah like that!
[3:54:37] <Darkrenai> @PizzicatoFive5 Just the stage
[3:54:41] <%Divryne> The five hit combo is up low low up low
[3:54:42] <coreyyotto> zigged when you should've zagged
[3:54:46] <Aussie_Manny> khadCult You will try.
[3:54:48] <%geeceevee45> phase 2 monkaS
[3:54:49] <+lumporr> !!!!
[3:54:50] <%terry_irvin> OHHHHHHH
[3:54:52] <DancesWitBalrog> YEYEYEYE RAGE ANGER
[3:54:53] <%cha0tic_klutch> If you reach your 70s you are on your last life, and can resume at any stage
[3:54:57] <Aussie_Manny> monkaS

[3:55:04] <Aussie_Manny> BANSHEE
[3:55:06] <niffinbox> 2nd phase is easier
[3:55:08] <stormhawk9891> GOTH
[3:55:10] <Ell1ot> i bet Paige could kill her super hard
[3:55:10] <$Jaxnos> this game is just a fucking art piece
[3:55:18] <+polothegreatest> cool PogBones
[3:55:18] <+MisterAvry> she fast
[3:55:20] <+lumporr> i mean i know 100 ways to kill u too bud everybody does
[3:55:23] <penitentpendant> Sure looks like she didn't give up the evil lifestyle
[3:55:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Her second phase is wayyy easier
[3:55:28] <SparkAfterDark> You can catch those if you have the skill unlocked
[3:55:30] <wqorst> anxiety beats
[3:55:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Paige could beat this fight blind
[3:55:34] <%Xelig> just use dodges like with sean
[3:55:36] <yukichocomilk> yeah this game is beautiful holy shit
[3:55:39] <mackovoir> is your copy of sifu from a garage sale, pat?
[3:55:39] <+Queen_Grimlock> when "she" gave you the chance?
[3:55:39] <Aussie_Manny> "But can you kill me 100 times?" ariW
[3:55:40] <AngryAsian5> She took "Be like water" more literally I see
[3:55:41] <%a_mad_dragon_> that braid + bun combo DansGame
[3:55:42] <akitanito> oof
[3:55:45] <+MisterAvry> right in the jaw
[3:55:46] <+lumporr> sean was a punk turns out
[3:55:51] <%Divryne> You can grab the knives when she throws them like bottles.
[3:55:51] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Getting old.
[3:55:56] <niffinbox> you can catch those knives if you have the skill @PatStaresAt
[3:55:56] <%cooldude69xx> Tag in Paige for this one
[3:56:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "As a boss, I get hyper armor and you don't Kappa"
[3:56:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> not gonna dodge those at all huh
[3:56:09] <SILENTBOB22> Catch them knives
[3:56:11] <stormhawk9891> God that's rad
[3:56:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt I've found this phase so much easier though.
[3:56:18] <Profmcstevie> Consult your fiance on optimal woman beating techniques
[3:56:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is there a game over?
[3:56:19] <cowboy_plague_doctor> oh you got this
[3:56:23] <DancesWitBalrog> you can catch the kunais and chuck it back at her to stun
[3:56:25] <%geeceevee45> beware not the woman who has killed 100 men, beware the woman who has killed 1 man 100 times
[3:56:25] <Aussie_Manny> Eye poke lasers.

[4:20:46] <+awesomeguy423> Heidern is like team rival?
[4:20:46] <%zeroarturia> Secret Agent team
[4:20:47] <Komayeda> rival team
[4:20:48] <TheQuadrupleS> Secret agent team
[4:20:50] <+awesomeguy423> team woolie LUL
[4:20:51] <teefpal> Hey look its woolie bait
[4:20:59] <+polothegreatest> Rivals yes
[4:20:59] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> Heidern Became a simp
[4:20:59] <Komayeda> so like, has pat not seen any of the trailers
[4:21:00] <+oAznoUta> team rivals
[4:21:01] <%Quigsies> Quigsies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Hey Pat, hope you‚Äôre doing well! Give babies lots of pets
[4:21:04] <+awesomeguy423> ok`
[4:21:08] <%Bluwizard21> never played this i have no idea who any of these are beyond the biggest of names
[4:21:10] <bakkatohri> Yes, time to beat the cute anime girl.
[4:21:12] <orochiblood> Pat has not followed any KOF XV news
[4:21:15] <+BirdcakeMN> YEAH beat up Kula
[4:21:19] <+kewlmyc> No Maxima?
[4:21:21] <TheQuadrupleS> Heidern is on team rival
[4:21:24] <TheSaltminer> DLC coming up is Rock, B Jenet and Gato as Team Garou, and Geese, Billy and Yamazaki as Team Southtown
[4:21:26] <+JustToWatch> Max was playing 14 last night, holy shit that was an ugly game
[4:21:28] <+gantz_zero> i think there's 2 teams of announced DLC including team southtown with Geese and Billy Kane in suits @PatStaresAt
[4:21:32] <%zeroarturia> I love Kula
[4:21:33] <Aussie_Manny> The announcer reminds me of Golden Boy's English voice actor.
[4:21:35] <+awesomeguy423> @Komayeda he hates fighting games on account of his two favorite games being stuck with SEGA, aka the most braindead publisher around
[4:21:35] <+polothegreatest> 100% dlc costumes
[4:21:38] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> the new kulla sucks
[4:21:39] <Josef_Stryker> It still surprises me that Kim isn't in the base roster
[4:21:42] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> look at her
[4:21:45] <Josef_Stryker> Is this the first KOF without him?
[4:21:47] <bakkatohri> Imagine going to voice acting school in Japan and you get typecast to making vaguely sexual pained cute anime girl noises
[4:21:50] <majindusto> Krohnen ACTUALLY  is K9999  Pat
[4:21:52] <Komayeda> ah
[4:21:54] <+awesomeguy423> Kim? yes
[4:21:57] <Aussie_Manny> K'
[4:22:03] <orochiblood> yes this is the first KOF without Kim and Im glad
[4:22:06] <%mr_sups> @Aussie_Manny I've been struggling to think of what it reminded me of.
[4:22:14] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> new kula sucks man, if youre not ready for the day it cannot always be night man..fuck
[4:22:17] <+awesomeguy423> I can't believe Woolie didn't get a code for KoF
[4:22:17] <Onamar> one inch punch
[4:22:18] <KnivesEve> oh snap kof15
[4:22:20] <Mattais88> counter?
[4:22:21] <%MooseIsGoose> Is King in this one?
[4:22:24] <%mr_sups> One-Inch
[4:22:24] <%shurtal> it's a one inch punch
[4:22:25] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I thought you'd play Tizoc, Clark and Daimon... LUL
[4:22:27] <+awesomeguy423> yes
[4:22:28] <Komayeda> yes
[4:22:36] <+polothegreatest> king? Yes
[4:22:38] <+awesomeguy423> @KaiserMario Daimon?
[4:22:39] <orochiblood> thats his bruce lee one inch punch
[4:22:42] <+awesomeguy423> there's no Daimon
[4:22:45] <bob900000> LUL
[4:22:49] <+JustToWatch> NOW DO IT FACING LEFT
[4:22:51] <%SvenHolgersson> Just like Woolie and Marvel
[4:22:53] <susukouhai> Pat is really committing to this Woolie impression bit
[4:22:54] <majindusto> KNOWLEDGE  REGAINED
[4:22:55] <nevan_44> LUL
[4:22:56] <%SvenHolgersson> You monster
[4:22:58] <%tank7013> Damn Pat can only do moves on one side, he really is a fighting game player
[4:23:01] <timbob> thought pat played on stick not pad?
[4:23:08] <%Wallabri> like riding a bike
[4:23:10] <%Nobrev> time to practice exclusively on the left
[4:23:18] <+gantz_zero> @timbob not for this game
[4:23:19] <%YakumoYomi> @timbob KOF is the exception
[4:23:25] <Komayeda> probably something very good
[4:23:26] <TheQuadrupleS> He plays KOF on pad he says
[4:23:28] <TheSaltminer> oh no, your right leaning bias is showing, next thing you know you'll be trucking to the capital to face Trudeau
[4:23:31] <timbob> ah that's interesting
[4:23:33] <+JustToWatch> it calls Max over and he plays for you
[4:23:50] <+polothegreatest> max is crazy sht doodMash
[4:23:56] <+gantz_zero> @TheSaltminer please don't remind me the real world exists on twitch
[4:24:08] <bakkatohri> @TheSaltminer And by trucking you mean renting a truck and pretending to be a trucker because real truckers can't afford to miss pay checks
[4:24:12] <%sdewts> This is some fighting games ass music in this fighting game
[4:24:32] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Max mode also acts like a FADC
[4:24:34] <+polothegreatest> 11 WutFace
[4:25:01] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt 2 buttons for EX supers
[4:25:03] <RyuuAoi> WTF PAT! GET WOOLIE AND REGGIE OVER NOW
[4:25:09] <+BirdcakeMN> Climax moves are universal at least
[4:25:15] <orochiblood> Both punch or kick buttons for level 2's
[4:25:47] <+gantz_zero> @RyuuAoi unironically i think curfews actually prevent that from even being a possibility, had he chose to
[4:25:53] <orochiblood> you're doing his climax
[4:25:56] <+polothegreatest> They change supers 2 buttons? doodBait
[4:26:00] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Climax super is now a universal input
[4:26:12] <+U_1___> K' is so sick
[4:26:19] <KenzBurp> @RyuuAoi god i wish we had curfews
[4:26:23] <Ultralazuli> it allows EX moves
[4:26:28] <+BirdcakeMN> Supers and EXs consume the bar instead of your meter meter
[4:26:29] <ErikFeral> it makes you Maximillian Dude for 5 Seconds
[4:26:31] <orochiblood> More damage, free EX's
[4:26:41] <Profmcstevie> It's uhh....Dream Cancel stuff right?
[4:26:41] <%BlackMage66652> HOW MANY DO COMBO CAN YOU DO IN THE FROZEN TIME?!
[4:26:45] <+gantz_zero> oh shit you mentioned max mode and now max is streaming lol
[4:26:50] <%SvenHolgersson> I think shit costs less too
[4:26:53] <orochiblood> You can do EX moves without Max Mode now.
[4:26:54] <+polothegreatest> Cancel supers and do ex moves
[4:26:55] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt so are you allowed to play matches online right now?
[4:27:04] <ErikFeral> @BlackMage66652 how many combos can you do on the frozen girl?
[4:27:05] <%SvenHolgersson> So you can chain that shit and be ep1c
[4:27:27] <Komayeda> the schmovement
[4:27:33] <+polothegreatest> I think just training no story tho doodSad
[4:27:35] <KenzBurp> @JustToWatch they just asked him to not do story stuff, so i assume yes
[4:27:39] <shikimagura> NO. EX moves are allowed even without Max Mode. MM just  gives you higher damage and let's you do LVL2 with versions of SDMs. Also unlocks LVL3s
[4:27:41] <RyuuAoi> FUCK THE POLICE
[4:28:02] <JohnXuandou> Pat you are the bad at the KoF
[4:28:03] <bakkatohri> @PatStaresAt Hey, Pat - remember that Telltale game, Wolf Among Us? It's getting a sequel for some reason????
[4:28:05] <HoneycombKeith> fuck, I halfway thought we got a surprise beta lol
[4:28:14] <+BirdcakeMN> You can do advanced and climax cancels without MM though
[4:28:21] <+polothegreatest> 14 isnt my forte doodSad
[4:28:24] <KenzBurp> @bakkatohri glass him-part 2
[4:28:25] <%BlackMage66652> [Glass him]
[4:28:26] <orochiblood> you dont need max mode to do ex's. its just with Max Mode, Ex's use the Max bar instead of your power bar so they're free.
[4:28:34] <%Felhad> what do you mean for some reason? it's one of the best Telltale games
[4:28:51] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You can do all that stuff without MAX mode but it costs more meter if you do
[4:28:55] <bakkatohri> Y'all knew it was getting a sequel already???
[4:29:02] <+polothegreatest> Wolf is back woolieGASM
[4:29:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[4:29:22] <Sulliman34> oh god the bitrate
[4:29:29] <%zeroarturia> Yeah its been confirmed it got a sequel
[4:29:33] <majindusto> @bakkatohri Wolf Among  Us is awesome  tho...So glad its getting  a sequel.
[4:29:35] <+BirdcakeMN> @PatStaresAt Do you know the button hold tip for KOF
[4:29:46] <$Mr_Bop> Mad jealous of y'all early access streamer folks rn
[4:29:55] <+TopTieramisu> everyone's favorite edgy boy, k'
[4:30:00] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You can also cancel lvl 1 supers into lvl 2 supers
[4:30:03] <Sulliman34> any new folks caught your eye pat?
[4:30:03] <Profmcstevie> God this character select is a candy store
[4:30:04] <badguy8312> would it be crazy if I played Xenoblade 2 without playing the first?
[4:30:12] <%BlackMage66652> Needs moar Shermie!
[4:30:20] <Profmcstevie> I LOOOVE this stage
[4:30:21] <rReizs> @badguy8312 nah its fine
[4:30:25] <+polothegreatest> Yep woolieGASM

[4:30:28] <KenzBurp> kula....whip.... cool whip
[4:30:29] <Darkred28> KomodoHype
[4:30:29] <Sulliman34> JESUS her run speed
[4:30:34] <$Mr_Bop> @badguy8312 Nah, but if you want to play 3 both are suggested
[4:30:34] <%Felhad> @badguy8312 basically unrelated games
[4:30:36] <RushUnplugged> @badguy8312 but why would you skip the good one
[4:30:41] <bakkatohri> I know next to nothing about KoF, but I know Shermie, because SHermie is super cute
[4:30:43] <Darkred28> This music is awesome
[4:30:51] <+TopTieramisu> i miss kula's outfit when it was an exact copy of k's
[4:31:08] <Sulliman34> the ice effects look great
[4:31:11] <secretbosssauce> Love the look of this stage
[4:31:14] <majindusto> I hope The Protomen music is in Wolf Among Us 2...And wasn't  just a Trailer  thing tho
[4:31:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @badguy8312 There's a few references you might miss out on, but it's pretty standalone. First Xenoblade is goddamn great though
[4:31:19] <+polothegreatest> Pat destroying new players confirmed woolieYE
[4:31:23] <+TopTieramisu> the ice looks waaaaaaay better than the fire
[4:31:34] <badguy8312> @rushunplugged cuz I watched all the cutscenes in a movie edit woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:31:41] <orochiblood> You can cancel supers into other supers
[4:31:41] <+gantz_zero> hell yeah whip
[4:31:43] <%BlackMage66652> Kula is smuggling peaches
[4:31:45] <+kewlmyc> She had a new Snowman move
[4:31:51] <TAGMANINK> She has Snowman
[4:31:55] <Onamar> this announcer
[4:32:01] <%Nobrev> @badguy8312 xenoblade 1 and 2 aren't super connected so you can play them in whatever order but if you plan on playing 3 I heavily suggest playing them both beforehand
[4:32:04] <+armormog> it's the akuma tatsu+dp of KoF
[4:32:05] <%zeroarturia> She had a new move pat
[4:32:10] <%Dova573> SourPls
[4:32:18] <%Felhad> Oh, if you saw the whole story then absolutely no reason you can't just go into 2
[4:32:21] <AngryAsian5> Bruh LUL
[4:32:22] <Ultralazuli> this theme reminds me of millionaire detective balance unlimited
[4:32:25] <TallYoda08> doodMash doodMash doodMash
[4:32:28] <+TopTieramisu> the whip looks pretty nice
[4:32:46] <%mr_sups> The Step on my move
[4:32:47] <+gantz_zero> ararararaara
[4:32:48] <+TopTieramisu> the real question is: does she still have her gun?
[4:32:52] <+polothegreatest> I would buy kof 98 dlc announcer woolieYE
[4:32:53] <%mr_sups> She still got her gun?
[4:32:54] <badguy8312> @felhad am I better off doing the same for 2 and then playing 3 when it drops?
[4:33:01] <majindusto> WHIP IT...WHIP IT GOOD!!!
[4:33:02] <+gantz_zero> i think so?
[4:33:02] <Darkred28> No Whip GF FeelsBadMan
[4:33:02] <tolloponik> dose she have her gun in this one?
[4:33:04] <JohnXuandou> she does not have a gun no
[4:33:08] <orochiblood> no she hasnt had her gun in years
[4:33:09] <EynoStiles> How was sound mind? was it a bust?
[4:33:16] <orochiblood> removed for obvious reasons
[4:33:22] <Sulliman34> am i crazy or does she sound like Jolyne
[4:33:24] <+kewlmyc> I miss her gun super
[4:33:27] <@Ranryu692> so this is just a fetish character, huh
[4:33:28] <%Felhad> You certainly could, but they're fun games
[4:33:29] <+gantz_zero> well that sucks
[4:33:43] <+TopTieramisu> looks like a diagonal trajectory
[4:33:52] <%mr_sups> Her Whip actually looks really GOOD. I usually looks like GARBAGE
[4:33:52] <+gantz_zero> @Ranryu692 it's not like she's in latex or anything
[4:33:53] <%terry_irvin> THIS GAME LOOKS INCREDIBLE
[4:33:58] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt That's new, it's basically a focus attack
[4:33:58] <skewerstar> Wait, so your KOF team is team K'? Kinda shocked you're not using any grapplers!
[4:34:06] <orochiblood> Shatter Strike costs a bar of meter but if you hit it, it refunds half.
[4:34:13] <%RetroCop87> I want Whip to ‚ÜìLK on me
[4:34:17] <jotabranded> CD 236
[4:34:22] <%cooldude69xx> @Ranryu692 Whips dont have to be a fetish thing. But they always are
[4:34:26] <badguy8312> @ranryu692 are there any KoF characters who AREN'T fetish characters?
[4:34:32] <tolloponik> @Ranryu692 it's just a character with a whip that's one you
[4:34:55] <+BirdcakeMN> Choi
[4:34:57] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> That dinosaur character is the coolest guy in the world.
[4:35:00] <majindusto> I hope there is DLC featuring the Maximum  Impact  brothers to  return!
[4:35:03] <%cooldude69xx> @Ranryu692 She laughs while stepping on you mommy, dont lie to me
[4:35:05] <%mr_sups> @badguy8312 FAIR
[4:35:07] <+TopTieramisu> choi is definitely a fetish
[4:35:20] <%patriotrenegade> DO COMBO
[4:35:23] <Sulliman34> kinda reminds me of rolento's usf4 ultra
[4:35:24] <JohnXuandou> raw shatter strike puts them in airborne crumple, but if you combo into shatter strike they're in grounded crumple
[4:35:27] <+gantz_zero> @majindusto i'd rather them than the stupid hands weirdo shit
[4:35:33] <DancesWitBalrog> Is King of Dinosaurs in this game or Tizoc?
[4:35:44] <+gantz_zero> @DancesWitBalrog dino
[4:35:45] <%patriotrenegade> Yo who tf asked for Whip back
[4:35:46] <+TopTieramisu> king of dino
[4:35:46] <+polothegreatest> KOD
[4:35:48] <+kewlmyc> King of Dinosaurs
[4:35:55] <TheDeimion> I was hoping they would have Kim's pants make a comeback
[4:35:56] <%MichaelDood> Hot damn this theme plagueTaps
[4:36:03] <%RetroCop87> anti-air?
[4:36:03] <DancesWitBalrog> YEYEYEYE Dino Man
[4:36:09] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Any new characters you thinking of trying?
[4:36:14] <+TopTieramisu> want kim's pants? better wait for DLC
[4:36:15] <TheDeimion> with their new graphics
[4:36:22] <+TopTieramisu> isla looks cool
[4:36:33] <TheDeimion> ya srsly , I'm hoping one of them is Kim and DA BOIS
[4:36:45] <+shirou_kokkan> I'm waiting for this
[4:36:51] <badguy8312> this song sounds like if Sesame Street decided to market towards teens all of a sudden
[4:36:58] <TheDeimion> is Mai in this ?
[4:37:05] <$Mr_Bop> @TheDeimion Kim not being in is the biggest bummer for me rn
[4:37:12] <$Mr_Bop> have to find a new 3rd
[4:37:13] <Darkred28> So far I think Chris and Ramon are on my team. Who should be my third if I like speedy characters?
[4:37:36] <+gantz_zero> slide a shitto
[4:37:44] <%Xelig> does that lady have stand hands?
[4:37:45] <jotabranded> Pat, try K', he's a fiend combo in this game
[4:37:53] <TheDeimion> @TheDeimion I thought I had everything I wanted when Yama was announced but with this really nice clothing tech they got , not having Kim would be a bummer
[4:37:59] <LanceDavidson> Yo, what if Kim was DLC in a team with his sons?
[4:38:01] <Komayeda> arright, lets go
[4:38:03] <+TopTieramisu> kim has one of my favorite rekkas in fighting games
[4:38:04] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Darkred28 Dinosaurs are pretty fast. A T-Rex can go like 30mph. So I would choose the dinosaur guy.
[4:38:05] <+polothegreatest> didnt they said kim was pending cuz hes poplar
[4:38:10] <%Jeemukun> Max is starting up his stream
[4:38:16] <TheDeimion> so is this actual release or is this a test again?
[4:38:16] <$Mr_Bop> @LanceDavidson that'd be perfect
[4:38:29] <+TopTieramisu> i don't both dong hwan and jae hoon
[4:38:32] <+TopTieramisu> don't want*
[4:38:36] <Profmcstevie> This is early access influencer power

[4:38:41] <LanceDavidson> SNK pls, I need Dong Hwan
[4:38:42] <$Mr_Bop> @TheDeimion full release is on the 17th
[4:38:42] <+TopTieramisu> that's too many similar moves with kaphwan as well
[4:38:43] <DancesWitBalrog> FT10 with Max would be cool
[4:38:47] <%cooldude69xx> @Darkred28 I've never seen a T-rex run, so I'll trust you on that
[4:39:06] <+TungstenoViperante> do a K', Kula and KROHNEN team
[4:39:07] <badguy8312> this coward won't even put Whip into SS colors. what a GOOF
[4:39:12] <LanceDavidson> This music slaps hard
[4:39:19] <TheDeimion> ahh ok , so is Mai playable? cuz those fan shenanigans looked absurd in the trailer
[4:39:28] <Profmcstevie> This soundscape is pretty nice, I can jam to it
[4:39:30] <+TopTieramisu> look at robert and his facial hair
[4:39:45] <+TopTieramisu> watermelon color isla

[4:43:02] <+TopTieramisu> been around since 97
[4:43:02] <TheDeimion> the fact blue isn't even her real hair colour just makes her so much more interesting; having practical function to an ability besides fighting
[4:43:05] <Zombrocom> The AI hates blocking I see
[4:43:08] <+TopTieramisu> but he did die in 97 as well LUL
[4:43:16] <%mighty_max_t> Chris was surprisingly fun in the beta when I tried him
[4:43:18] <TheDeimion> that's why I like Beni, even tho he looks way better with his hair down
