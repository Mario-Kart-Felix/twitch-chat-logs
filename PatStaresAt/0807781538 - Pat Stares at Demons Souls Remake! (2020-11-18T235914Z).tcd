[0:00:21] <redrins> pat will be the one to figure out the big secret of this game Kappa
[0:00:38] <+CapnClassix> @XeroSigmaPrime That sounds deliciously awful
[0:00:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> i always add like 50grams of MSG to a bag of Doritoes and shake it up. Makes them ten times better
[0:00:58] <sharksdanger> yo
[0:01:02] <dmtjinni> MY BODY IS READYYYYY

[0:16:33] <+masked_hero_lucky> I'll be honest, when this started being talked about I thought this would be like the Ebola or Bird Flu scare.
[0:16:33] <fuji_92> nah, every one who said it would be over soon was full of shit, this shit is going to last until maybe all of next year if no half 2022

[0:17:25] <+GaiaGreen> @saadi90 me too brother!
[0:17:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> A bidet is just a really small shower if you're determined enough.

[0:32:05] <%captainpodock> @patstaresat Loud in Contrast should be the name of your memoirs

[0:32:19] <Parapattern> Demonseses's Souls
[0:32:19] <%bone_reaper69> did Pat start a new game or hes only this far?
[0:32:20] <$savagesforblood> @feralspirit41 no
[0:32:21] <Sigma_190_Beta> @evbites Maiden is hot but I like Dolls design a bit better.
[0:32:21] <londorpaleale> @evbites that's a hard choice
[0:32:25] <%ssjklyco> A Monumental headache
[0:32:27] <%Keaton_x> This is my first experience with Demon's Souls. I had to look it up..
[0:32:32] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Did it take longer than to find that stair bonfire in DS3?
[0:32:32] <+andiwaffles> how does chat feel about the remake?
[0:32:36] <+twohitgood> the one lit candle is too subtle of a hint.
[0:32:36] <+WupingFosters> did they still stick the leaderboard way up top?
[0:32:36] <Finakala> I preordered the PS3 version as well so nobody had any hints back then either
[0:32:37] <@SoFarFetched> @bone_reaper69 only this far,this is the second stream for Demon's Soul
[0:32:38] <thatoneguynamedty> Yawp, I think that's pretty much everyone
[0:32:41] <%emperordread> Yeah, fair
[0:32:41] <+VvTacoSaladvV> Happened to everyone I think
[0:32:41] <%brachydios777> @evbites You can’t do anything with a doll man, well you can but it would be limited
[0:32:41] <%gstut1> when i first played this game i did knight and beat the game fat rolling lol
[0:32:43] <+StrifeZubia> Why is this hub so effing huge
[0:32:46] <%juxtest> Have to go all the way upstairs but not all the all the way upstairs
[0:32:46] <KnightAsteran> isnt there an illusory wall up here?
[0:32:47] <derap41> Looks like a secret
[0:32:50] <allanmiri> In the tower with the cthulu mages I got lost because I never noticed the other path because the camera never pointed to it. I felt like I was going insane.
[0:32:52] <xwiishirex> Hey chat, did they restore the broken arch stone?
[0:32:52] <+twohitgood> you also see him in loading screens.
[0:32:54] <%linSP> you would think they'd put the monumental onthe second level, not next to the entrance
[0:32:57] <baddod> uuuhhhh i want to play this so badly
[0:32:59] <%RoggleJr> This game is looking sooooo good.
[0:33:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Ew child
[0:33:02] <%TheMattman1313> Roll credits!
[0:33:03] <%Anime_Flux> The Golden Child
[0:33:03] <$savagesforblood> no
[0:33:06] <+eanscrale> They manage somehow to explain less in this game despite not having an interconnected world
[0:33:08] <Esperflame> He's always the one with the candle lit in front of him
[0:33:08] <derap41> Doing a shit job kid
[0:33:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They didn't animate him?
[0:33:09] <tetrabrick1lt> WutFace
[0:33:09] <Aydarkzero> did Pat pick Royalty?
[0:33:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> Love that his mouth doesn't move.
[0:33:11] <Finakala> @xwiishirex No
[0:33:11] <baddod> monumental has no facial animations
[0:33:12] <+evbites> i say maiden cause i don't have to think of gehrmen banging it
[0:33:12] <baddod> what
[0:33:12] <islandsunn> his lips don't move
[0:33:13] <%ssjklyco> Lips still don't move. woolie is mad now
[0:33:13] <%Valdorick> Stab that child
[0:33:13] <+VvTacoSaladvV> Nexus is best Hub but it's also so large that it's daunting at first
[0:33:15] <+skylerpilot> nah Pat, he actually sticks out more now.
[0:33:16] <+hax_metatron> He looks shittier
[0:33:18] <%SirKeigan> Did the Nexus have music before?
[0:33:19] <allanmiri> It's Aang!
[0:33:22] <%Pacifcgrim> why does it look like pat as a child?
[0:33:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEMON SLAYER PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[0:33:27] <$savagesforblood> why is that one not animated lol
[0:33:29] <%SirKeigan> His lips don't move thouogh!!!
[0:33:31] <LunarRemix> Weird, he doesn't move his mouth like the other NPCs
[0:33:32] <Louie_Salmon> Babyface
[0:33:32] <Finakala> YEAH, OG CUTSCNES
[0:33:33] <%linSP> its fine the baby is psychic
[0:33:33] <%patriotrenegade> there is no spoon
[0:33:35] <%SirKeigan> No lip movement!
[0:33:35] <%captainpodock> How does everybody feel about this updated art style, if I didn't know this was a Souls game right away I think it would take me a second to realize it was one.
[0:33:37] <%SirKeigan> yes!
[0:33:37] <londorpaleale> @evbites thanks, you ruined her for me
[0:33:39] <scrublord009> THESE FUCKING AANG LOOKING MOTHERFUCKERS
[0:33:41] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt somehow his lips not moving is comforting
[0:33:42] <derap41> Then everything cnhanges when the fire nation attacked
[0:33:43] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to derap41! They have given 379 Gift Subs in the channel!
[0:33:43] <+VvTacoSaladvV> some lips move now, some don't
[0:33:44] <+WupingFosters> yeah! the old busted! screw the new hotness
[0:33:45] <MonstarGrrrl> kill the child
[0:33:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This is a redraw, not old art
[0:33:47] <Finakala> Wait that's different
[0:33:48] <%TheMattman1313> INA NO
[0:33:48] <%brachydios777> Also MB has a choker which I think is cute
[0:33:49] <$savagesforblood> 0/10 lips dont move
[0:33:49] <%ElkRiverDog> How come HIS face doesn’t move?!
[0:33:51] <%KaiserMario> Not the old art at all
[0:33:52] <%sakeydo> Has anyone figured out that mystery door yet?
[0:33:52] <xwiishirex> @Finakala While I understand why they wouldn't, that is a missed opportunity.
[0:33:53] <%SirKeigan> This looks new
[0:33:55] <tubit> Is it the old art, or just very similar?
[0:33:56] <%Anime_Flux> Find the Ajanti Dagger
[0:33:57] <+jetjagger222> isn't he supposed to be a statue
[0:34:02] <%linSP> haha lul
[0:34:03] <huskarl_zap> this is new
[0:34:05] <Louie_Salmon> Man any time From tells a story it's pretty generic huh
[0:34:07] <%SirKeigan> Int he original these were still images
[0:34:08] <@SoFarFetched> only adults can move their lips,children have to earn that privilege.
[0:34:08] <%patriotrenegade> Mystery door is Bloodborne 2
[0:34:08] <+SuicidalLemmming> cause him and the maiden are telepathic
[0:34:12] <huskarl_zap> All the old stuff was piss yellow
[0:34:14] <Finakala> @TheMattman1313 Humu Humu
[0:34:14] <+skylerpilot> @tubit its new
[0:34:16] <%sighphers> kid hates the letter e

[0:34:19] <thatangryguyofde> is this a lucky Ted run?
[0:34:21] <%arkv01> is it just me or does maiden sound off?
[0:34:23] <%luketrapwalker> @Anime_Flux I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE LUL
[0:34:26] <allanmiri> I think the kid isn't really a human and is a boll or something which is why his lips don't move.
[0:34:32] <Parapattern> I'm still disappointed no cat.jpeg
[0:34:34] <%Lion_kun> Fix that 6th archstone cowards!
[0:34:35] <%Teintstein> is this a LOTR rip-off
[0:34:36] <%SirKeigan> I'm calling it, 6th Archstone is DLC that they're badly lying about
[0:34:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wait Demon Souls is a ctulthulhuthuluhu?
[0:34:37] <%Anime_Flux> heheh
[0:34:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SIX RINGS
[0:34:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Youre in demon souls
[0:34:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> All the old stuff was a yellow instead of Marvel movie blue
[0:34:45] <+skylerpilot> The sequence yes, the ART is new
[0:34:48] <%gstut1> i super forgot about the exposition
[0:34:49] <oniwahoo> I don't think I ever saw this when I played
[0:34:49] <xwiishirex> The Arch Stone of Missed Opportunity
[0:34:49] <BimboBagging> one to the giants of the undertimed development
[0:34:49] <@SoFarFetched> are we just watching LOTR
[0:34:50] <%SirKeigan> it just looks better here
[0:34:53] <%derap41> But they where all of them deceived
[0:34:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> turok shadowman
[0:34:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> People really think Bluepoint could design a Demon's Souls level LUL
[0:34:59] <%stemlo_> shadowmin
[0:34:59] <%linSP> skyrim is dlc
[0:34:59] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt TheY re-did the art, this isn't the og art
[0:34:59] <%arkv01> OOPS GIANTS
[0:35:00] <%WhereIsWill> the SHAYMAN
[0:35:01] <%toastybites> AND ONE RING TO LOSE
[0:35:01] <@SoFarFetched> I didnt sign up for watching LOTR
[0:35:01] <%Laecerelius> Oops!
[0:35:02] <%ShogunNoonto> no this is remade
[0:35:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> "better"
[0:35:04] <%Teintstein> pat you're going to get DMCA'd for LOTR
[0:35:04] <+evbites> @londorpaleale think of his ancient nuts smashing the fine porcelain that resembles his favorite student who probably killed herself out of guilt
[0:35:04] <%juxtest> One to some clumsy dick who immediately broke it
[0:35:04] <ulcaban> Isn't there also an Ivory Tower in DS2?
[0:35:07] <RyuuAoi> This shit MOLDY
[0:35:10] <%SirKeigan> Imagine actually meeting the people that got this stuff? To mean the actual Shaman
[0:35:11] <%Anime_Flux> But they were all of them DECEIVED
[0:35:12] <tubit> The Arch Stone of DLC?
[0:35:13] <londorpaleale> whoopsie doodles
[0:35:13] <%Laecerelius> That shard was lost to darkness
[0:35:17] <$savagesforblood> maybe they'll give us that in a brand new dlc?
[0:35:17] <%brachydios777> Shadowman
[0:35:20] <%arkv01> oh god thats horrifying
[0:35:21] <%SirKeigan> Northern? You mean Aztec?
[0:35:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LITERALLY JUST LOTR
[0:35:24] <socratetris> i know i'm very late, but i figured I'd still get in before the game started
[0:35:26] <%arkv01> half living, half statue
[0:35:28] <%cvp5127> shits fucked
[0:35:28] <+VvTacoSaladvV> Good thing there are five backup archstones.
[0:35:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You heard about the door?
[0:35:31] <%derap41> Bunch of lazy bastard if you ask me
[0:35:31] <ulcaban> @tubit Vaati thinks so
[0:35:32] <%Pookiedaexzile> "We kinda shit the bed on that one"
[0:35:33] <+twohitgood> and now 6th archstone will be dlc because crazy talk activate.
[0:35:45] <%derap41> Yeah it just was dropped
[0:35:46] <$savagesforblood> sens fortress is what I heard
[0:35:49] <xwiishirex> @ulcaban Are you thinking of Heide's Tower or the Winter DLC?
[0:35:52] <+WupingFosters> probably a bad sign that there's only one babby holding reality together
[0:35:55] <%toastybites> just jacking it
[0:35:56] <thatoneguynamedty> If the monumentals were so powerful then why are they all dead?
[0:35:57] <Josef_Stryker> What set is Pat wearing? Is that the Royal Outfit?
[0:35:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> The other games are the sxth arch stone
[0:36:02] <%AzureGale> FBI OPEN UP
[0:36:02] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[0:36:05] <%arkv01> god this game is fuckin beautiful, time to remake darksouls re-re-mastered
[0:36:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> If you read my lore break down on Twitter
[0:36:06] <Finakala> From what I recall of the 6th Archstone it looks kinda like Eleum Loyce ye
[0:36:06] <Visorak6> drop shield
[0:36:07] <%luketrapwalker> PAT STOP IT
[0:36:09] <%TheMattman1313> Nah kid I gotta wrap a bandage around my head

[0:36:15] <icantstopthescreams> Stop jostling the child
[0:36:16] <%RoggleJr> Do not do that in front of the child.
[0:36:16] <%derap41> They did use a lot of the idea in Sens fortress but its not the same
[0:36:17] <+jetjagger222> not in front of the kid pat
[0:36:18] <ulcaban> @xwiishirex NO, I remember now, I was thinking of the Ivory King
[0:36:18] <mrlastchance1> I see they still don't actually speak
[0:36:18] <rosemon5001> you heard about the locked door that was added? @PatStaresAt

[0:37:06] <%swesterly> Fuck this dope mystery is killing me, been watching Distortion2 investigate all day to no avail
[0:37:13] <%SirKeigan> If the world seems okay now with only one monumental why did they need so many? I wonder what the world looked like with more monumentals. Maybe less fucked up?
[0:37:14] <%swesterly> Door*

[0:37:57] <tubit> The innocent time before the leaderboards are glitched to hell
[0:37:58] <+eanscrale> Well no one really uses this room because hackers
[0:38:00] <xwiishirex> Woolie and Pat's LP of Dark Souls 1 got me over the hump on Souls.

[0:38:06] <Explodincatz> its not dark its demon
[0:38:06] <huskarl_zap> stone of un honest eyes
[0:38:08] <%bevyrage> this isn't dark, this is DEMONS SOULS
[0:38:09] <%Jekado> thats why its called DARK souls HAHAHA wait....
[0:38:11] <Tooniearcade> it's fine
[0:38:12] <+tigerfang86> O N E G U Y
[0:38:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The old nexus was way brighter
[0:38:17] <TheMadBadger> I still don't understand why world tendency is tied to online. That's such a dumb decision.
[0:38:17] <%coreyyotto> perfectly calibrated
[0:38:18] <%Deano8817> it's the game's normal dark
[0:38:19] <+SuicidalLemmming> just kill yourself in the nexus everytime you go human
[0:38:20] <+twohitgood> you can do invasions and do pure black
[0:38:21] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to explore the Monumental floor, there's a hidden staircase there
[0:38:22] <%PhysicsLB> isn't it supposed to be dark?
[0:38:22] <+andiwaffles> can you try to be in white (not pure white) to talk to Selen? I haven't seen anyone talk to her yet
[0:38:23] <%Monkeyweed21> perfectly c a l i b r a t e d
[0:38:23] <%SirKeigan> There's only a total of like, 15 stones of ephemereal eyes right?

[0:38:29] <Aydarkzero> what cap card did you end up getting?
[0:38:30] <dots4eyes> It's a souls game...of course it's dark
[0:38:33] <%SirKeigan> Compared to the dozens of Embers in DS3
[0:38:39] <redrins> oh right careful with gold coins and leveling up right after, people have gotten their luck stat and level bugged
[0:38:43] <wolverinewaswrong> For some reason I remember the nexus being blue
[0:38:44] <%SirKeigan> I'm watching on a 720p HDTV
[0:38:45] <%Teintstein> because Pat has special eyes

[1:07:25] <%aishman> His? Hit.

[1:10:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> @AzureGale Is that a fire emblem reference?
[1:10:05] <Giztech> the hook weapon in DS3 were great for trolling people that replied on their shield
[1:10:08] <%gstut1> hey, where is the Zweihander?
[1:10:12] <+deviljhojho_> bluepoint does quality work even if some redesigns make me go hmmmm
[1:10:12] <+hax_metatron> @g_thunders It was already cool in OG. We knew it was good
[1:10:13] <Aydarkzero> magic infused need the other guy
[1:10:13] <+andiwaffles> I think its an Ed thing
[1:10:18] <%brachydios777> @sirkeigan Well I hope you know your limit man, cause there’s gonna be alot of “YOU DIED”
[1:10:19] <BigNLazy> You gonna grab a blunt weapon?
[1:10:19] <+deviljhojho_> rest in power fat officer
[1:10:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @VvTacoSaladvV Its not carnival salsa its from a good place i've gone to many times but they held a challenge of eating a NC Salsa and not getting a drink in 5 minutes. If you could you got a bottle
[1:10:27] <Finakala> The only problem I have with the PS5 is that whenever I go back to the PS3 or earlier, the loading times are going to be hell
[1:10:29] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @gstut1 It's the claymore in this game
[1:10:29] <%AzureGale> @Emperor_Machinus Yes
[1:10:30] <%SirKeigan> Yea i'll be good lol
[1:10:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> Woo I win
[1:10:41] <samuelfisk> kingmemelord97 Yes it was.
[1:10:51] <+hax_metatron> Like people going crazy should know DeS already did all the cool things. Storm King was already cool before the “graphics” and “3D sound”.
[1:10:53] <%SirKeigan> I'll cap it off at 4 ounces worth. just one full glass with some ice
[1:10:58] <%brachydios777> @sirkeigan O7
[1:11:00] <%kingmemelord97> @doc_ock_rokc does the burn stack ? and is it a buff or a debuff
[1:11:01] <%SirKeigan> I've also got some bong hits to take
[1:11:10] <xwiishirex> Stockpile Thomas: Still the Worst Dad
[1:11:14] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @doc_ock_rokc Ok I was picturing a homemade carnie batch you won in like ring toss so that's better.
[1:11:15] <%SirKeigan> What's O7?
[1:11:17] <%AzureGale> Garbage ass-shields
[1:11:18] <JayEarly> I only want Bluepoint Bloodborne if they don’t change the art direction at all
[1:11:20] <%gstut1> @VvTacoSaladvV i got a claymore laready i thought there was a ulrea great sword
[1:11:21] <SoftButtCheeks> y helo thar
[1:11:23] <+Yukasmarvin> So are there new levels added to the game?
[1:11:25] <Finakala> Storm King is still the coolest spectacle fight in the whole franchise
[1:11:29] <epicbiomouse> @PatStaresAt you can store items from inventory
[1:11:32] <%brachydios777> @sirkeigan Salute
[1:11:45] <%SirKeigan> Cheers!
[1:11:45] <%G_Thunders> @hax_metatron I already knew the fight was special on PS3. But there’s still a meaningful difference when the visuals and audio match the scale of the fight
[1:11:46] <ScreamLord> Boss Souls
[1:11:48] <Aydarkzero> no carry them always
[1:11:53] <%BinaryFireball> are boss soul weapons good in this game?
[1:11:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @kingmemelord97 it stacks a bit and it gives you fire breath stronger then pepperspray but it also puts you under a similar effect in you mouth
[1:11:55] <+D00msDayDan> what are we, some kind of demon's souls?
[1:11:58] <+deviljhojho_> title drop
[1:11:59] <%bone_reaper69> @PatStaresAt this game uses the PS button cards feature in a cool way. You can warp from cards that you're actively doing
[1:12:03] <Aydarkzero> it's bright
[1:12:04] <allanmiri> The places we live define us as much as we define them. They are filled with our remembrances. When we return to them, we give the dead life once more.
[1:12:07] <%SirKeigan> The vista is beautiful
[1:12:08] <CandyCoatedConfection> incredible
[1:12:09] <+deviljhojho_> what is so great about the skeleton scimitar anyways?
[1:12:19] <+deviljhojho_> looks like utah
[1:12:21] <%BinaryFireball> what is a card?
[1:12:21] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @gstut1 Adjudicator's machete maybe. no zweihander in this one sadly. Agree it's my favorite weapon
[1:12:22] <%cylish> So im getting the feeling demon's souls has a lot less leveling up than the others
[1:12:27] <%brachydios777> Nice view
[1:12:28] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Fantasy Arizona
[1:12:31] <%logoth_> Oh wow, Pat is a caster??
[1:12:37] <%SirKeigan> 2-1 is great because you get a vendor straight away that sells hardstone and sharpstone. Just grind some souls and level your weapons up
[1:12:38] <+hax_metatron> @g_thunders I used my imagination and it was already cooler than anything. Them adding these graphics doesn’t increase the scale of it for me. Souls games are already special
[1:12:40] <ScreamLord> @BinaryFireball Some of them are really good, yes
[1:12:43] <%brachydios777> Is this Nevada?
[1:12:45] <%Agami23> im glad im not the only one who thought of utah
[1:12:46] <CandyCoatedConfection> the lizards look so lifelike now it's weird
[1:12:47] <allanmiri> Reported for animal cruelty.
[1:12:50] <%SirKeigan> blacksmith, not vendor lol
[1:12:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is pat winning chat
[1:12:55] <%bevyrage> @deviljhojho_ good damage, decent damage type being slash, it's naturally upgraded to +1 by default, and it can carry through the late-mid game
[1:12:55] <%BinaryFireball> ok but what is a card?
[1:12:55] <%SirKeigan> Tremors!
[1:12:56] <thatoneguynamedty> Yo the lizard looks good
[1:12:59] <%Xelhesia> damn this is gorgeous
[1:12:59] <%SirKeigan> No
[1:13:02] <%G_Thunders> @cylish its about the same as bloodborne, you end around level 70 or 80 first time
[1:13:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wonder
[1:13:06] <JayEarly> @deviljhojho_ it does magic damage which isn’t resisted by most enemies
[1:13:11] <+deviljhojho_> @bevyrage oh baby
[1:13:11] <%BinaryFireball> oooh nvm @ScreamLord thanks!
[1:13:13] <%promessav2> playing ds1 and just discovered painted world and wrath of the gods
[1:13:15] <%SirKeigan> yes
[1:13:16] <%promessav2> gg
[1:13:20] <Evil_Pineapple> this isnt bugsnax
[1:13:21] <%patriotrenegade> what is it that compels humans to fry dough
[1:13:22] <+deviljhojho_> @JayEarly oh magic damage too? damn
[1:13:22] <huskarl_zap> dirty dan
[1:13:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:13:24] <%SirKeigan> boooooo
[1:13:29] <%cylish> @G_Thunders ok cool thanks!
[1:13:31] <%SirKeigan> This guy looks fucked
[1:13:33] <Buteman> Filth man
[1:13:34] <+hax_metatron> For example watch Woolie playing OG DeS. He loses his shit during storm king. You can’t say that is only captured with improved graphics and sound.
[1:13:34] <islandsunn> what do you need souls for
[1:13:38] <DSD24> Filthy Frank
[1:13:40] <%SirKeigan> Wait they're cheaper?
[1:13:42] <Srthunda> ok the weird face animations work for this guy
[1:13:46] <%SirKeigan> This was always here dude
[1:13:47] <tubit> Trader guy looks great
[1:13:48] <%KaiserMario> He always sold that
[1:13:51] <Aydarkzero> @islandsunn levels and buying stuff
[1:13:56] <%VvTacoSaladvV> He always sold the small shards
[1:13:56] <Parapattern> "Who you callin' Pinhead?"
[1:13:57] <cosmeleon> man looks like a rat person
[1:14:00] <%SirKeigan> Always has been LUL
[1:14:02] <%brachydios777> No more jpegs
[1:14:03] <+hax_metatron> LUL he always did noob
[1:14:03] <xwiishirex> Grease Man, "What are you buying?"
[1:14:03] <%gstut1> i miss his old smker voice
[1:14:08] <%mikessdd> I always wondered what the shop people end up using their souls for
[1:14:11] <+twohitgood> there's definitely things that alleviate the grindy aspects. crystal gekkos respawning is the biggest/most apparent.
[1:14:12] <huskarl_zap> thank you old god
[1:14:16] <%linSP> this guy seems pretty smart
[1:14:17] <thatoneguynamedty> I think he might be cheaper now though
[1:14:20] <xwiishirex> He was there, but moves as you proceed further.
[1:14:26] <%kingmemelord97> murder thes lizards for their back rocks
[1:14:26] <%dekkitout> Why does he sound like Grant Morrison
[1:14:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> To let you know the nests exist?
[1:14:38] <%Solid_Stro> To tickle your balls a little
[1:14:41] <+twohitgood> @dekkitout because he's scottish.
[1:14:41] <ScreamLord> Demon's Souls Remake seems to almost literally just DeS with a graphics upgrade. For better or worse
[1:14:44] <JayEarly> wasn’t he more of a mutant in the original?
[1:14:44] <%SirKeigan> because that is Grant Morrison
[1:14:52] <nmaten> helpful message
[1:14:56] <%patriotrenegade> Its Fernando, the squid-hunting manwhore. By day he hunts squid and by night he pays the bills with unscrupulous sex. He didnt choose this life, its just how he rolls
[1:14:56] <+ChaosAethr> Question for Chat, is the blueblood Sword Good?
[1:14:56] <%linSP> i love how sandy this looks now
[1:14:58] <+deviljhojho_> they dont make em like they used to
[1:14:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> @ScreamLord That is basically what it is, apparently.
[1:15:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Have you considered LARPing as a black guy on twitter to make your opinions more credible? @PatStaresAt
[1:15:10] <JayEarly> wasn’t that old guy like a dregling in the og?
[1:15:10] <%roscoe_rosaline> Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah! Hi Pat! Hi Chat! Hi Pubby! Hi Paige!
[1:15:11] <%brachydios777> @screamlord What about the new animations?
[1:15:13] <%SirKeigan> It's really just a graphical upgrade and some quality of life stuff, plus a new UI. THAT'S IT
[1:15:15] <+hax_metatron> @monkeyweed21 WTF
[1:15:22] <%logoth_> Im also weak to being stabbed.
[1:15:24] <%AzureGale> What about magic stabbing
[1:15:24] <%gstut1> mace works good on em too
[1:15:25] <+deviljhojho_> hey man
[1:15:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> man this salsa is weak
[1:15:30] <%logoth_> I dont know about you guys but I HATE being stabbed
[1:15:33] <%KaiserMario> HERE HE COMES, The worst design in the game...
[1:15:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Stabbed in the ass?
[1:15:36] <Aydarkzero> it's him!
[1:15:37] <%BinaryFireball> that fuck
[1:15:40] <%BinaryFireball> stab that fuck
[1:15:41] <%linSP> FAT EVIL
[1:15:41] <%WhereIsWill> is pyromancy in DeS? I forget
[1:15:42] <ulcaban> FAT BASTARD
[1:15:42] <%kingmemelord97> big boy
[1:15:43] <%dekkitout> @Monkeyweed21 Sir, that is deep lore that only someone who watches Ricky and Elliot would know
[1:15:44] <%Agami23> how is the haptic stuff for demons souls?
[1:15:45] <%SirKeigan> All this needed was a new coat of paint. If they changed too much it would be wrong
[1:15:46] <%Monkeyweed21> THE BLACK OFFICIAL
[1:15:50] <%kingmemelord97> rubbing his tum tum
[1:15:52] <%stabbityrabbit> Oh hey. Worst redesign in the game.
[1:15:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Garbage redesign
[1:15:54] <+deviljhojho_> im a fat fuck i like to quick fuck
[1:15:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> What IS PAT DOING IN THIS VIDEOGAME
[1:15:54] <%SirKeigan> no pyromancy, just fire spells
[1:15:56] <Aydarkzero> i think he's winning the magic fight
[1:15:59] <%Laecerelius> Stab his butt!
[1:15:59] <DSD24> He's yucking it u
[1:16:00] <cosmeleon> this guy looks straight out of american mcgee's alice
[1:16:00] <%mikessdd> that was amazing timing
[1:16:02] <DSD24> up
[1:16:02] <%AzureGale> Weak to magic, huh
[1:16:04] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @doc_ock_rokc I'm sorry to hear about the salsa
[1:16:05] <%roscoe_rosaline> Capitalist D:<
[1:16:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @dekkitout it was on Woolie's twitter
[1:16:06] <ScreamLord> @brachydios777 Fair, there are some new animations too, but almost all of the old DeS jank is still in the remake.
[1:16:07] <%gstut1> im so disappointed with the FAT Official
[1:16:07] <fakespecialist> "this is easiest place to go as my character"
[1:16:08] <%brachydios777> Hey it’s Pat
[1:16:10] <+twohitgood> i'm still kinda meh about the change the ministers. i liked it better as a frozen face/mask. made it more grotesque than just fat and with warts.
[1:16:10] <%kingmemelord97> wait
[1:16:11] <studleydoorite> I remember his laugh being more... sonorous
[1:16:14] <%SirKeigan> His laugh isn't as cool
[1:16:14] <%linSP> cmon gold coin
[1:16:16] <+hax_metatron> Why does he have pus? DansGame ruined design
[1:16:18] <huskarl_zap> GET PYROMANCIED YOU WIZARD FUCK LUl
[1:16:18] <ulcaban> He seems so happy and laughing
[1:16:18] <%gstut1> they got rid of his smile and cackle
[1:16:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> why's he got a front butt
[1:16:22] <%kingmemelord97> was that the ntr macot of demon souls
[1:16:28] <%Agami23> arnt those fat guys super important to the story?
[1:16:28] <Aydarkzero> the laugh just isn't the same :(
[1:16:28] <%BinaryFireball> cuties
[1:16:30] <Evil_Pineapple> good thing healing items are optional
[1:16:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> I've had hotter Ghost pepper salsas from the same place @VvTacoSaladvV
[1:16:34] <%SirKeigan> They look bigger
[1:16:34] <jorniev> WAY to laught withoout smiling
[1:16:35] <%mikessdd> yeah these guys look fine
[1:16:35] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Look how they massacred my boy
[1:16:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So don't get hit :)
[1:16:40] <%Solid_Stro> Pyromancy requires the rubbing of the tum tums
[1:16:42] <%Walkerartorias> @PatStaresAt not sure if someone else mentioned this yet but ripostes and backstabs are different for one handing and two handing
[1:16:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Max run out of all his healing items trying to beat the Red Eye Knight
[1:16:43] <CappuccinoGuil> If you have Talisman of God and enough Faith to talk to the miracle merchant, why not get Healing?
[1:16:45] <+deviljhojho_> they got a facelift
[1:16:46] <%SirKeigan> The dying groans are so awesome
[1:16:48] <%SirKeigan> Really brings it to life
[1:16:48] <%G_Thunders> I always thought they were wearing masks. Apparently they just looked like aliens or whatever
[1:16:49] <Aydarkzero> @kingmemelord97 well...
[1:16:51] <%roscoe_rosaline> @doc_ock_rokc I am also sorry about the salva. Weak salva sucks.
[1:16:52] <2deep5u> they look much more angry for some reason tho
[1:16:58] <cosmeleon> i like the *washing* of drawing your sword they added
[1:17:13] <%roscoe_rosaline> Salva? Jesus. I need coffee.
[1:17:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> this area has the netflix south america filter
[1:17:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They never used to be "Kirby's fucking pissed" lol
[1:17:24] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @doc_ock_rokc Oh yeah, sometimes batches can vary in heat level.
[1:17:26] <%SirKeigan> cooool
[1:17:31] <Aliensigma> thats not what crushing does
[1:17:32] <+hax_metatron> DeS is very Metroidvania like with its weapon types

[1:17:53] <%brachydios777> Oh wait I figured it out, we’re in Brazil
[1:17:53] <huskarl_zap> the deserts of ireland

[1:17:59] <%SirKeigan> Space Scotland
[1:18:06] <JayEarly> that’s a fucking revelation
[1:18:13] <%mikessdd> spoopy
[1:18:15] <%WhereIsWill> this game looks next gen af
[1:18:18] <%SirKeigan> try two-handed
[1:18:20] <Aydarkzero> @kingmemelord97 there's a moment later where they have a woman captive
[1:18:26] <ulcaban> I'm reminded of concept art for Carthus from DS3
[1:18:26] <%Agami23> pat, i saw a picture that was scotland, ireland, and wales with no england in the middle that said "imagine if it was all just a dream"
[1:18:28] <%logoth_> The claymore does garbage damage against these guys
[1:18:28] <cosmeleon> a whopping 10 damage
[1:18:33] <%linSP> thankfully pat has the magic sword
[1:18:36] <%SirKeigan> now they're all one-shot
[1:18:38] <%kingmemelord97> @Aydarkzero OH NO
[1:18:40] <%Smeagleman6> Oh hey, more DeS!
[1:18:43] <huskarl_zap> they've been emasculated they used to be twice your size
[1:18:44] <%roscoe_rosaline> God, that launch sound effect for magic is so fucking good.
[1:18:46] <%bevyrage> that's a legit good backstep
[1:18:56] <%SirKeigan> Doggoes
[1:18:57] <+Goblinz_3> Game looks slick
[1:18:57] <%SirKeigan> Doggos
[1:19:06] <+Grayhammatter> Doggos
[1:19:11] <%KaiserMario> SACKMAN
[1:19:15] <huskarl_zap> ui is too modern
[1:19:16] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I use a mail breaker just for these guys and then immediately continue using the claymore for everything else
[1:19:20] <seaechiowai> pewpewpew
[1:19:24] <+Goblinz_3> You literally shoot magic like you're in a harry potter fanfiction LUL
[1:19:25] <%Caped_Eggy> I can't get over the sound of the soul arrow dude
[1:19:25] <Thalchampz> same
[1:19:29] <DracaenaLeaf> Gameplay is a plus yea
[1:19:30] <Evil_Pineapple> animations confirmed for not graphics
[1:19:30] <Thalchampz> animations are super clean
[1:19:34] <+twohitgood> sound design and animations in this game are tops.
[1:19:37] <%WhereIsWill> unique backstabs and ripostes too
[1:19:38] <%SirKeigan> Oh yea, get those guys with the bags. They have more upgrade materials
[1:19:44] <+hax_metatron> Animations are the best thing yes
[1:19:45] <%brachydios777> I love me some audio porn, anyone who has played one of the new Stasis subclasses in Destiny 2 knows what I’m talking about
[1:19:49] <ToneBacas> people might put animation in the graphics pile as well by ignorance
[1:19:49] <+Quack_of_Dawn> The soul arrow looks SO GOOD
[1:19:49] <%KaiserMario> The combat animation looks great, the talking... Not so much...
[1:19:50] <+eanscrale> Helps that the skeletons don't snap into their active attack frames
[1:19:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> DOGGO
[1:19:51] <Evil_Pineapple> FUCK DOG
[1:19:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Everyone focused on the animations for Shadow of the Colossus
[1:19:55] <+twohitgood> uh...dogs are in 1-2.
[1:19:56] <+Goblinz_3> OH NO
[1:19:57] <%roscoe_rosaline> HELL YEAH
[1:19:58] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:19:58] <Meltgar> Actually yeah, the only problem people didn't like was the whole redesigns
[1:19:59] <+hax_metatron> Graphics are actually kind of a miss for me. I miss the original aesthetic
[1:20:00] <warmnoid> LUL
[1:20:01] <%stabbityrabbit> The animations are great, but I hate nearly every redesign they've done. The most mixed of bags.
[1:20:02] <MSCanyon> oh no

[1:24:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> the strength modifier only applys to strenght scaling weapons
[1:24:15] <%Arweynn> Threre's totally an implication of DeS Grey Fog -> Age of Ancients, DS3 Age of Deep Sea + Painting of Blood and Fire -> Bloodborne, and Infant Great One -> Old One, as an infinite cycle

[1:26:57] <%roscoe_rosaline> They need to back that dude into the doorway a little more.
[1:26:58] <%logoth_> The graphic fidelity looks great but I miss the freaky stylized contrast
[1:27:00] <%Chimeraelite> Souls games make us comfy as FUCK after a while. They're special like that
[1:27:09] <passione13> Has there been any berserk references yet?

[1:29:26] <SoftButtCheeks> U heard it here first. The atmosphere is very cool.
[1:29:29] <seaechiowai> I saw vaati play this a few days ago and most of the speedrunning tricks still work
[1:29:31] <Parapattern> I love all the clutter
[1:29:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> thanks ozone
[1:29:46] <%VvTacoSaladvV> No pat ThEY RuInEd tHe aTmOsPhErE!
[1:29:55] <seaechiowai> I think they just didn't touch the gameplay
[1:29:56] <+hax_metatron> @seaechiowai It’s the literal same game running underneath so OF COURSE
[1:29:56] <%Smeagleman6> @PatStaresAt I imagine the atmosphere in there would be quite warm considering it's a lava place!
[1:30:01] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Can you check your durability real quick?
[1:30:08] <%SirKeigan> Lighting looks great
[1:30:08] <%BubbaRands> Gee Pat needs an Oven for all those HOT TAKES he makes

[1:30:35] <%KaiserMario> Falchion can break easily here...
[1:30:37] <seaechiowai> @hax_metatron yeah that's what I said
[1:30:39] <%gstut1> time for maiden astea...im prepared to cry...
[1:30:39] <%mikessdd> Pat this whole game got shitfucked. the internet told me so
[1:30:42] <DSD24> You don't have a soul
[1:30:43] <%blue8moon> LUL
[1:30:43] <%roscoe_rosaline> UNEQUIP IT A THIRD TIME >:D
[1:30:43] <%bevyrage> undulating abs
[1:30:44] <%patriotrenegade> tall
[1:30:47] <+YamadaZero> Hi everyone!
[1:30:47] <SovPho> neither of those things are what pecs do
[1:30:47] <%MyNameIsRasus> FIGHT VERGIL ON THE RAIN NOW
[1:30:48] <%patriotrenegade> attractive
[1:30:54] <%ShineTheDiamond> You wish your head looked that good
[1:31:02] <%LegendGHT> what's your favorite build usually in souls games?
[1:31:03] <%mikessdd> For real though I'm super excited to play this for the first time ever
[1:31:06] <%patriotrenegade> studly jaw
[1:31:13] <%Puhff> jimmies rustlin in the wind
[1:31:17] <ulcaban> Super jacked guys have a rough time in places like that, they need lots of food and exercise
[1:31:21] <%BubbaRands> Galloping Pectorals
[1:31:26] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @gstut1 Oh will we get Prepare to Cry re-remastered?
[1:31:27] <+YamadaZero> How has Demon's Souls been treating everyone this evening? :)
[1:31:30] <+eanscrale> Dark Whip was so good
[1:31:31] <%Solid_Stro> When are you and Woolie gonna sword fight shirtless in the rain?
[1:31:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> why doth thine pecs boil o crimson bearded one
[1:31:38] <%MyNameIsRasus> Power stancing greatswords in DS2 was fun
[1:31:42] <%Quigsies> Hexes were so cool
[1:31:43] <+FxyDEV> Fate Zero Lancer
[1:31:45] <%G_Thunders> Magic is cool as hell just because of the sound design here
[1:31:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now its kicking in!
[1:31:46] <%Quigsies> Wish they were in 3
[1:31:46] <%ShineTheDiamond> LUL
[1:31:52] <+FxyDEV> Diarmuid Build
[1:31:52] <rcand9> im not gonna make fun of the people who dont like the look of the new demons souls because their opinions also valid, but im so excited to get into this game myself and get lost in it.
[1:31:54] <%Pigg1yJuffs> So as someone who never played DeS originally, any tips for playing (that don't involve your minmaxing mind goblins). @patstaresat
[1:31:54] <%Maruko19> I really don't like DS2 in general
[1:31:55] <%LaughingCatt> I would legit love a DS2 remake where they just make the map transitions make sense
[1:31:56] <Josef_Stryker> You can do practically anything in DS2 it was so fun
[1:31:57] <%roscoe_rosaline> Good save Pat. We'll never know the eldritch horrors that are you pecs.
[1:31:58] <Thepothero> pre neft holy / hexs were broke af in DS2
[1:31:58] <%patriotrenegade> I miss powerstancing
[1:31:59] <%juxtest> Fatten up those hands
[1:32:00] <+SinisterBroccoli> My default if I can do it, is sword main hand spear offhand Hilde style
[1:32:01] <ulcaban> @Solid_Stro They did once, but the camera wasn't recording
[1:32:03] <TheChewDawg> I've been watching for 30 seconds and haven't seen any Demons. I rate this game 2 out of 19.
[1:32:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> One hell of a slow burn on this salsa
[1:32:04] <+Goblinz_3> Oh boy boss
[1:32:04] <+twohitgood> like powerstance partizan?
[1:32:06] <DSD24> @FxyDEV Diaurmuid!
[1:32:16] <2deep5u> patron means cartridge in hungarian
[1:32:23] <+zxero01> I went double katana and wrecked with bleed and poison
[1:32:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> I LIKE THAT
[1:32:25] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I don't like ultra greatswords in DS2 there I said it.
[1:32:25] <Parapattern> That's true
[1:32:27] <%T_Sasquatch> Playing without a shield in any dark souls seems crazy to me
[1:32:30] <%roscoe_rosaline> Hell yeah, that's rad.
[1:32:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> das2 was flawed but still cool. powerstancing alone made that game really stand apart, and I love how your character can be left-handed. Oh, and the dragon bone fist is the best weapon, and it is a travesty that it didn't come back.
[1:32:39] <Naho_Saenoki> @SinisterBroccoli Same. Bonus points if you put electricity on the spear and fire on the sword, to mimic the effects of guard breaks and unblockables.
[1:32:39] <+FxyDEV> ah the only meltstone shard in the whole game
[1:32:39] <%LegendGHT> I'm checking out Sekiro for the first time tonight, any tips for someone who's played way too much Bloodborne and is not a parrier by nature?
[1:32:39] <+Bruzur> Using the Scraping Spear in PvP again is glorious.
[1:32:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> wait you have MP regeneration holy shit
[1:32:45] <rcand9> theres like 2 "normal" bosses in the rest most are gimmicks
[1:32:48] <%ShineTheDiamond> Hmmmm
[1:32:50] <%derap41> Its not just dudes in armor
[1:32:51] <%roscoe_rosaline> Nice nice nice
[1:32:55] <fakespecialist> playing shield, haha big sword 2 hand goes bonk
[1:32:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> Naho_Saenoki that's a good idea
[1:32:58] <%patriotrenegade> Lightning Heide's Greatlance is OP in DS2, banana's damage plus crazy range and some of the highest poise damage in the game
[1:33:00] <%Chimeraelite> Yea the Royal starts with the MP regen ring
[1:33:01] <+Totally_Not_Toby> LUL
[1:33:03] <%T_Sasquatch> I think ESTUS is s SHIT mechanic
[1:33:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> GET FUCKED LOL
[1:33:09] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt Is the Upgrade system still complicated?
[1:33:09] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:33:13] <%logoth_> DS2 had great cosplaying potential
[1:33:13] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> LUL
[1:33:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> DS2 had the best ideas and the poorest execution. all the magic was great
[1:33:18] <%Puhff> explain
[1:33:22] <rcand9> LUL
[1:33:24] <Profmcstevie> I mean it makes sense, you wouldn't just have mortals besting demons in battles of pure BIG NUMBERS
[1:33:29] <%Puhff> [I don't understand]
[1:33:30] <JayEarly> @t_sasquatch Estus is perfection
[1:33:36] <ulcaban> Is it as confusingly laid out as it looks?
[1:33:40] <+RyTYoung> So wait you don't jam titanite shards into weapons?
[1:33:45] <%bone_reaper69> they made it a TINY bit easier
[1:33:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> Estus is a great mechanic
[1:33:46] <+twohitgood> it's worse than DS1
[1:33:50] <%bone_reaper69> and in some ways harder lol
[1:33:52] <rcand9> yeah upgrades in demons requires a diploma
[1:33:52] <%G_Thunders> World tendency is still something you have to follow a guide for
[1:33:52] <%ShineTheDiamond> WAIT ARE THE BOSSES SHADOW PUZZLES?! OH NO! PEACH IS DOOMED
[1:33:53] <%Solid_Stro> I think it’s rather rhombus psaBougie
[1:33:54] <+aidoru_jam> aidoru_jam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[1:33:56] <Explodincatz> reminds me of Kaga
[1:33:59] <%Maids4lyfe> titanite doesn't even exist
[1:34:01] <%roscoe_rosaline> Jesus, I've heard so many people explain this shit and it still doesn't make sense.
[1:34:04] <Naho_Saenoki> @SinisterBroccoli Glad you think so.
[1:34:05] <%T_Sasquatch> @jayearly blood vials and grass are far superior
[1:34:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> estus is a hell of a lot better than farming healing items in DeS and bloodborne MaxLOL
[1:34:06] <%LegendGHT> does world tendency still also not make sense?
[1:34:08] <+FxyDEV> oh based world tendency is untouched
[1:34:09] <%WhereIsWill> its the salamanders!
[1:34:11] <%bone_reaper69> the menus when upgrading tell you some more of the paths for your weapon
[1:34:12] <%WhereIsWill> they cute tho
[1:34:13] <%derap41> There are some very subtle changes
[1:34:15] <Parapattern> Eh, you don't need to understand it so much unless you want to have stupid damage weapons
[1:34:15] <%logoth_> I had to restart my game to get Dragonbone smasher, Fuck world tendency
[1:34:17] <%SirKeigan> Just use the Wikidot page
[1:34:18] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I'm coming for that crushing claymore.
[1:34:19] <+hax_metatron> ONEGUY
[1:34:20] <JayEarly> i just jam titanite shards
[1:34:25] <ToneBacas> world and character tendency is also another system that was not made any easier in this. there's still no explanation as to how it works
[1:34:27] <%bone_reaper69> but they also changed the names of some stones which confused me lol
[1:34:29] <%brachydios777> Here’s a weird ass news update. Apparently there’s gonna be a sequel to freaking Skark Boy and Lava Girl
[1:34:32] <JayEarly> more damage is better than less
[1:34:33] <%kingmemelord97> fire on the lizard why
[1:34:35] <%trustycoyote> @roscoe_rosaline Think like a "forking" upgrade path for each weapon. It's like that
[1:34:39] <+hax_metatron> It’s the same fucking game OHMYGOD I’m going to lose my mind every time chat says these mechanics have changed!!!!!!
[1:34:53] <Parapattern> @brachydios777 Are you KIDDING ME?
[1:34:57] <%LegendGHT> Sharkman and Lava Woman
[1:35:03] <%T_Sasquatch> Estus requires either playing ahead like a bitch then going back to refill estus or you just yolo it until you die
[1:35:05] <ulcaban> That's a Korone reference!
[1:35:09] <%KaiserMario> These are salamanders, not lizards
[1:35:10] <%WhereIsWill> anyone here have roasted lizard? so good
[1:35:10] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I realized how broken DS1 was when I had like a +13 zweihander before Orenstein and Smough
[1:35:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> @brachydios777 they couldn't even get taylor back tho
[1:35:11] <%brachydios777> @parapattern I shit you not
[1:35:12] <$Timesteel> some weapons like meat cleaver can be made with weapons upgraded at +0 for some weapons and like +3 or +6 for others shit is fucked
[1:35:13] <$Futurecity10> A major change is they ruined them music
[1:35:17] <%kewlmyc> I didn't know about the MP regen ring. I just beat 1-1, so I might just start over to get it. Dex/Mag are my favorite builds
[1:35:19] <+CannonHeroBrett> @LegendGHT that shits gona be great lol
[1:35:24] <$StrawberryPantsu> For one it has online
[1:35:27] <%SaiyanShoto> We also have that secret door in this game
[1:35:27] <Funky_Honkey> fire in the water
[1:35:28] <%roscoe_rosaline> @trustycoyote Fair, that makes sense.
[1:35:29] <ToneBacas> @Futurecity10 agreed
[1:35:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The door of mysteries
[1:35:32] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> music is a major downgrade
[1:35:33] <+Goblinz_3> Only one thing has to change and everyone starts getting goblins
[1:35:37] <$StrawberryPantsu> Well Legitimate online
[1:35:37] <%kingmemelord97> yo shark boy and lava girl in 3d was the shit
[1:35:46] <+hax_metatron> The only things they’ve changed are drop rates for items and added new items, and one door. THAT’S IT!!!
[1:35:46] <%Caped_Eggy> Long time
[1:35:48] <%WhereIsWill> halberd builds were yall at?!
[1:35:52] <%Caped_Eggy> Or short
[1:35:52] <%patriotrenegade> the secret door that leads to Bloodborne 2
[1:35:55] <%bevyrage> secret door with SECRET LOOT
[1:35:55] <rcand9> someone tried to glitch through it
[1:35:57] <%roscoe_rosaline> God DAMN that looks good.
[1:35:59] <samuelfisk> Agreed Chester. It’s too bombastic even in slower fights.
[1:35:59] <%KaiserMario> Oh boy, getting heavy right about now...
[1:36:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> @VvTacoSaladvV Zweihander in DaS1 is so much fun. I love pancake'ing people with it
[1:36:02] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Watcht eh loot behind that door just be grass or some shit
[1:36:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Good. It was cool when they did it for SoTC.
[1:36:02] <%trustycoyote> @WhereIsWill Yo
[1:36:03] <%bone_reaper69> they made ladder climbing a bit faster too
[1:36:03] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I'll bet the 17th Colossus is behind that door
[1:36:04] <Jolnir> BloodTrail
[1:36:05] <DSD24> @hax_metatron New music too
[1:36:05] <allanmiri> I bet that door is DLC.
[1:36:06] <%Maids4lyfe> secret door?
[1:36:08] <Aliensigma> what do you think is behind the secret door?
[1:36:09] <Explodincatz> why are items capped at "x2" on pickup?
[1:36:11] <tetriata> @PatStaresAt Not everything is minor. I don't know if it was intended but they changed how crystal lizard spawns work so now everybody drowns in upgrade materials
[1:36:12] <+Mitchellsocks> I know the old music has a very specific character, but it had such a synthy jank to it
[1:36:14] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt just T pose through the door. Ez
[1:36:16] <%LegendGHT> damn this game looks nice when you get it into the light
[1:36:16] <TheChewDawg> Does the secret door lead to a Secret Tunnel?
[1:36:21] <%T_Sasquatch> The secret door is just to fuck with people. There's literally an invisble wall
[1:36:22] <%SaiyanShoto> The fact that Max was tagged in a tweet about it from Bluepoint has me super curious
[1:36:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @hax_metatron you can select multiple soul items to crush
[1:36:28] <%brachydios777> Out of all the movies to gey sequals, fucking Shark Boy and Lava Girl gets one
[1:36:30] <%Laecerelius> upgrade man time
[1:36:31] <CappuccinoGuil> big change
[1:36:32] <%G_Thunders> I cant believe they changed the frame rate drops and camera clipping through the geometry in this level. Bad remake
[1:36:33] <+hax_metatron> @dsd24 Well yeah not taking about artistic decisions. Music is a downgrade for me personally :(
[1:36:34] <KazairLux> the item behind the door is going yo be a Blood Vile or something related to Bloodborne I'm calling it
[1:36:37] <%brachydios777> *get
[1:36:38] <%patriotrenegade> IT BETTER BE BLOODBORNE 2
[1:36:38] <JayEarly> i think the new music is very good on its own
[1:36:42] <$Timesteel> the whole area around the door has invisible walls too so if they want to glitch in it has to be through the front door
[1:36:47] <%LaughingCatt> that sounds like a good thing
[1:36:49] <rcand9> crystal lizards were always a pain
[1:36:53] <SovPho> @G_Thunders #nochanges
[1:36:53] <ezackthefirst> pat would play himself in a video game!
[1:36:55] <rcand9> im glad they changed it
[1:36:56] <%moogleboy1984> Wake me up when you get a drop of Pure Bladestone
[1:36:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> the 6th archstone is gonna be behind the secret door
[1:37:01] <Thepothero> PURE BLADESTONE FUCK
[1:37:04] <+hax_metatron> Oh yeah music is fine but the OG is untouchable in its uniqueness
[1:37:04] <%LaughingCatt> Crystal Lizards in DeS SUCKED
[1:37:05] <DSD24> @hax_metatron Oh yeah I agree a lot of the new music is hit or miss
[1:37:10] <%kingmemelord97> youll never gett a bloodborne 2 chat
[1:37:13] <%WhereIsWill> andres dad??
[1:37:13] <Parapattern> I'm still mad that Bloodborne wasn't a Demon's Souls sequel
[1:37:18] <+Grayhammatter> eyyy, it's ED
[1:37:20] <%roscoe_rosaline> TINY blacksmith.
[1:37:21] <SovPho> oh this UI is clean
[1:37:22] <%bevyrage> @T_Sasquatch the secret door also has an item that spawns with some unknown requirements too. considering bluepoint did something similar in shadow of the collossus i can see it being a big easter egg in this one too
[1:37:24] <chromonaut747> crystals lizards were dumb and its a good thing they changed it
[1:37:24] <ezackthefirst> @kingmemelord97 what
[1:37:26] <SovPho> why is it so clean and why do I not like it
[1:37:29] <%LegendGHT> so is there no way this could have ran on a ps4?
[1:37:33] <%superc37> @t_sasquatch so unnecessary grinding in a game where youre expected to bang your head againt encounters over and over again is somehow better than a mechanic with more thought put into it than not at all
[1:37:44] <ezackthefirst> @LegendGHT in 30 fps
[1:37:48] <jorniev> i feel bad, because after this game came out my hype deflated a lot, i think i did not miss demons souls as much as i thought, and that feels bad.
[1:37:50] <%Caped_Eggy> I'm so sad they change tower knight's music lionFeels
[1:37:51] <%Laecerelius> Mash those souls into that weapon
[1:37:52] <huskarl_zap> old va was better
[1:37:53] <SovPho> give me dirty ui i hate this clean stuff that looks way better
[1:37:57] <rcand9> @LegendGHT are you kidding it would have run like shit
[1:37:57] <alphonseisbest> love this dude
[1:37:59] <%mikessdd> the item that spawns behind the new door is actually the bloodborne pc port
[1:38:03] <%templar010> aaaay more demons
[1:38:07] <%ShineTheDiamond> Are there enough loose threads at the end of Dark Souls that a sequel will be expected now that it's been graphically updated?
[1:38:10] <JayEarly> BRING ME DEMONS SOULS
[1:38:13] <%LegendGHT> i bet the dragon bridge part looks amazing
[1:38:14] <+Grayhammatter> red hot KICK
[1:38:14] <2deep5u> supa hot demon soul
[1:38:16] <%W3rddrizzle> W3rddrizzle subscribed with Prime.
[1:38:21] <%superc37> also watch the item behind the door be a grass or some shit
[1:38:26] <+Pilau32> People dont understand how weak the PS4 is
[1:38:30] <Parapattern> @seaechiowai Just cuz I love Demon's Souls so much and I thought it'd be a cool connection
[1:38:32] <thebehatted> I cant believe they didnt catch that infinite luck stat bug during testing
[1:38:33] <JayEarly> did they change that guy’s voice actor?
[1:38:34] <$Timesteel> they changed the name in this game now it’s the searing demon souls or something stupid like that
[1:38:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Please no
[1:38:36] <ezackthefirst> i h8 cheesing magic in souls games
[1:38:39] <ezackthefirst> fuck that shit
[1:38:39] <%dekkitout> Umbasa ThankEgg

[1:38:47] <JayEarly> i remember him being scottish
[1:38:49] <%SirKeigan> Transitive property of bullshit means
[1:38:50] <$Futurecity10> They are all branches on the Tree of Yggdrasil
[1:38:50] <%roscoe_rosaline> UMBASA
[1:38:52] <+eanscrale> Umbasa!
[1:38:52] <lilibana> No they don't
[1:38:52] <alphonseisbest> WHERE?
[1:38:52] <EuropanLamprey> She talks crazy talk
[1:38:53] <%WhereIsWill> you CAN go crazy wit it
[1:38:53] <Cerabret100> wait when did bloodborne make a connection to demons?
[1:38:54] <%Ynkubus_> Thats super loose interpretation tpough
[1:38:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong Pat
[1:38:56] <%brachydios777> Can you get me a BONELESS DEMON SOUL
[1:38:56] <%LegendGHT> just different nations of the same universe?
[1:38:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> VERY VAGUELY
[1:38:57] <%superc37> WERE implied. that was an idea scrapped from early in development.
[1:38:59] <ScreamLord> Time is convoluted in Soulsborne
[1:38:59] <%LaughingCatt> May the Good Umbasa guide your way
[1:39:00] <jon651> Pat did you complete BugSnaxx??
[1:39:00] <Cerabret100> oh the umbasa line
[1:39:04] <%Jekado> they are all connected even Armored Core
[1:39:04] <londorpaleale> Gaskwang Umbasa
[1:39:05] <%G_Thunders> They’re all painted worlds
[1:39:06] <indig0bird> I thought they patched out all the direct references
[1:39:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats super wrong Pat
[1:39:11] <%brachydios777> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:39:13] <%KaiserMario> GASCOIGNE
[1:39:16] <%LaughingCatt> Gascoigne, not Gehrman
[1:39:17] <$Timesteel> gascoigne had an umbasa line
[1:39:20] <Thepothero> Is it bad to say that i want a bulpoint remake of bloodbounre ? @PatStaresAt
[1:39:21] <passione13> Blighttown
[1:39:22] <tetriata> @ezackthefirst DeS magic cheese is the strongest cheese in the series
[1:39:23] <+Bruzur> Let’s not forget that Slave Knight Gale’s arena is basically the ending area of this game.
[1:39:24] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> You’re totally right, despite being a prequel this feels like Dark Souls 4
[1:39:24] <rcand9> pogbasa
[1:39:24] <%logoth_> Gaskwanh
[1:39:25] <%patriotrenegade> Gascoigne
[1:39:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong Pat
[1:39:29] <%dekkitout> Also, I'm pretty sure Gaskwang is a foreigner
[1:39:31] <Discount_CJ> It's all connected!
[1:39:32] <alphonseisbest> THAT DON'T MEAN SHIT PAT
[1:39:33] <%superc37> @patstaresat WERE implied. that was an idea scrapped from early in development.
[1:39:34] <%arkv01> no he was actually saying mmm basa... fillet
[1:39:35] <Jolnir> painted world cursed blood
[1:39:36] <%Ynkubus_> There more like nods than straight up connected
[1:39:36] <%patriotrenegade> Gaskwank
[1:39:37] <%Garthunox> Gascoigne pat
[1:39:39] <%bread_assassin> If it's cut, does that mean that reference is still relevant?
[1:39:42] <%SirKeigan> They lost Soul Arts, meaning no magic
[1:39:42] <%Garthunox> Not Gehrman
[1:39:43] <%Laecerelius> Could just be a reference
[1:39:45] <%Maids4lyfe> They also found the corpses of Fat Ministers in the Chalice Dungeon
[1:39:46] <%SirKeigan> It kinda explains it
[1:39:46] <+Romuken> cruuuud im so late
[1:39:46] <danknugglit> Gars QWEIN
[1:39:46] <$Futurecity10> Dark Souls and Demons/borne take place on different branches on the Tree of Yggdrasil
[1:39:47] <%ShineTheDiamond> @PatStaresAt Thanks for answering my question! <3
[1:39:47] <+chvmpchange> Martyr Logarius has Soulbrandt too
[1:39:48] <Sunstalker> The Sincere prayer ring cast animation also led to Solaire's Praise the Sun.
[1:39:48] <alphonseisbest> no way man, thats reaching
[1:39:49] <xwiishirex> Lore is convoluted in Souls games.
[1:39:50] <thebehatted> also fluted armor can be seen on a body in a chalice dungeon
[1:39:51] <Valtorias> Gaskwan yes
[1:39:52] <%CyberScorpion13> CyberScorpion13 subscribed with Prime.
[1:39:55] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> goose clang
[1:39:56] <rcand9> yeaa
[1:39:58] <+Romuken> how far is he in the level? Looks like dwarven mines.
[1:39:58] <CappuccinoGuil> YUP
[1:40:02] <devanmuse> so your only evidence is something that was removed from the beta? that nobody was supposed to see?
[1:40:02] <megaman_sentinel> yeah these guys are just at work and you come through killing everybody
[1:40:04] <%KaiserMario> psaWrong
[1:40:04] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yes i feel that
[1:40:04] <+Grayhammatter> yeah
[1:40:06] <%roscoe_rosaline> Ye, they jus chillin
[1:40:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> well but also they aggro on you sooooo
[1:40:07] <rcand9> totally thats what i always thought
[1:40:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt would you rather have Bloodborne 2, or Demon's Souls 2?
[1:40:08] <%bone_reaper69> they could be slaves
[1:40:08] <%LegendGHT> isn't patches in a few of them too
[1:40:10] <BlueLunecy> Isn't that literally most Souls levels?
[1:40:10] <%templar010> Falchion is super nice
[1:40:11] <%stardustcrusad3r> what they doin anyways
[1:40:12] <DSD24> Well the Demon Slayer in this game is a asshole
[1:40:14] <ezackthefirst> sony cucking us by not remastering bloodborne LUL
[1:40:19] <%stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt Actually, the Bloodborne Demon's Souls connection was teaken out. They decided against it partway through development. A lot of the Demon's Souls connections got put in the Chalice Dungeons instead.
[1:40:20] <tetriata> That's once of the best parts of DeS compared to a lot of later games levels
[1:40:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat could not be more wrong about them being connected
[1:40:21] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Gascoigne
[1:40:21] <+CannonHeroBrett> @Romuken he just met the smith
[1:40:22] <%SaiyanShoto> It's like if a guy just busted down your door and started shooting magic at you on your couch
[1:40:23] <%mikessdd> dude we're just hitting rocks and now you're killing us. please stop
[1:40:23] <%gksnipa> their all basically dead anyway
[1:40:23] <+Romuken> Would it be better to watch from here, or wait till the vod?
[1:40:25] <%kingmemelord97> to be fair pat you didnt swing your sword first
[1:40:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> Every Des/DS/BB linking theory has to do some big stretching
[1:40:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> not Gehrman
[1:40:29] <CappuccinoGuil> They are just making an espresso and you shove 70cm of enchanted steel through their chest. Rude much?
[1:40:29] <%trustycoyote> By that logic would DMC and RE be in the same universe?
[1:40:30] <%bone_reaper69> nice
[1:40:32] <rcand9> haha
[1:40:32] <%superc37> neither, both ended just fine.
[1:40:33] <+CannonHeroBrett> nice one
[1:40:34] <snowmanie> Demon's Souls was good about making levels seem like actual places that were used
[1:40:34] <Sunstalker> That's why it's such a good level. But fuck 2-2
[1:40:35] <%LaughingCatt> yes
[1:40:35] <%KaiserMario> YEAH
[1:40:37] <Parapattern> YEP
[1:40:37] <%ajvstheworld> God this looks fuckin gorgeous.
[1:40:39] <%Maids4lyfe> @LegendGHT Patches is in everything, his actor is Miyazaki's friend IRL
[1:40:39] <%Laecerelius> Do Patches and the Moonlight make King's Field and Armored Core part of this shard universe too?
[1:40:41] <londorpaleale> LUL
[1:40:41] <%SirKeigan> YES
[1:40:41] <Qexec> yes
[1:40:41] <alphonseisbest> nid33
[1:40:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah, it resets
[1:40:42] <fakespecialist> nicce
[1:40:42] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@seaechiowai) (warning)
[1:40:43] <%ShineTheDiamond> Wow
[1:40:43] <%bevyrage> you're suppose to drop from the top aren't you?
[1:40:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Not getting that until next run LUL

[1:40:46] <%bone_reaper69> quit/reload?
[1:40:47] <%Caped_Eggy> Demon soul has the most "your char is an opportunist" vibe to it
[1:40:47] <+twohitgood> you fucked up.
[1:40:47] <%SirKeigan> Yea but it's just a Great Club

[1:40:55] <+twohitgood> you're supposed to run across.
[1:40:56] <%Xelhesia> it should reset
[1:40:56] <ezackthefirst> DO IT
[1:40:56] <+chvmpchange> Ive never heard a compelling Dark Souls - Bloodborne connection.
[1:40:57] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt would you rather Bloodborne 2 or DeS 2?
[1:40:57] <%patriotrenegade> run bitch
[1:40:58] <alphonseisbest> you run
[1:40:58] <CappuccinoGuil> When you load the level again they come back
[1:40:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> do a plunging attack from above Kappa
[1:41:02] <ToneBacas> i wonder if reloading works
[1:41:02] <%Solid_Stro> Reload the Level
[1:41:02] <7th_JusticeFlame> Reload
[1:41:02] <%arkv01> 2-1 is also armored spidey baby
[1:41:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Run
[1:41:04] <%SomeSageAdvice> you're supposed to run across the boards before they break
[1:41:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> its joke Pat
[1:41:07] <fakespecialist> reset a d rj
[1:41:07] <Sunstalker> there is no top, it's run over it when it resets
[1:41:07] <Parapattern> You gotta run like hell
[1:41:08] <+hax_metatron> Restarts the game @patstaresat
[1:41:09] <%ajvstheworld> ajvstheworld subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[1:41:09] <%brachydios777> No jump in Demon’s
[1:41:10] <%Maids4lyfe> @Laecerelius demon's souls was originally a king's field game that was cancelled
[1:41:10] <%arkv01> 100% deS2
[1:41:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Run across the bridge that broke
[1:41:10] <+Romuken> @CannonHeroBrett ah thank you. How long has he been playing? Long enough for me to wait for the vod, or did he take like an hour before playing?
[1:41:11] <islandsunn> dig up stupid
[1:41:12] <passione13> I think dmc and re are in the same universe
[1:41:13] <+Bruzur> Try save/quit to reload the planks?
[1:41:13] <nilla_24> you just run
[1:41:14] <+flipsilog> you need to run before the planks collapse
[1:41:15] <+hax_metatron> Restart and run @patstaresat
[1:41:15] <chhdez> Do a flip
[1:41:16] <%patriotrenegade> yeah you can
[1:41:17] <seaechiowai> dude your modbot is dumb. just saying
[1:41:17] <Profmcstevie> Try cry but be wary of sad
[1:41:17] <juarezgorgeous> just make a new character duh
[1:41:18] <%arkv01> bloodborne has so much lore it can wait
[1:41:18] <augusta_wind> just do it good
[1:41:22] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt so does that make the souldborne world just the worst to live in?
[1:41:22] <%stabbityrabbit> Just IAD over to the ledge. C'mon Pat.
[1:41:23] <%Keaton_x> Try tongue but hole
[1:41:25] <%patriotrenegade> you just arent pushing the right buttons
[1:41:28] <%SirKeigan> @patstaresat It's just a great club and some soul items
[1:41:31] <fakespecialist> just iad
[1:41:32] <EuropanLamprey> Best weapon in the game over there, works on all builds, kills bosses easily, that bridge is gone forever too
[1:41:40] <greytiziocaio> Bloodborne is actually a sequel of the Echo Night franchise
[1:41:40] <+skylerpilot> no drop attacks either
[1:41:40] <+hax_metatron> Restart the game the ledge will be back
[1:41:42] <+CannonHeroBrett> @Romuken playing dont know exactly but hes been life for about an hour and 40
[1:41:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> from above?
[1:41:48] <+Bruzur> @patstaresat try the save/quit to see if the assets reload.
[1:41:51] <%ajvstheworld> How good does the controls feel?
[1:41:57] <londorpaleale> I had an invasion that lasted 3 hours on this level.
[1:41:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, have you SEEN the magma?
[1:42:00] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt wonder if that door is dlc
[1:42:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I just got here, are ya winnin, Pat?
[1:42:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Will paige be playing ds3 again? or is she still broken?
[1:42:13] <%gstut1> i beat Maiden Astrea... BibleThump
[1:42:15] <%SirKeigan> It won't matter, it's done for
[1:42:17] <uretrafaia> did they take advantage of the new triggers stuff on the controller for this remaster?
[1:42:24] <%Agami23> oh? not doing a 9 hour stream like last night?
[1:42:24] <+blastazoid00> Magic looks so pretty
[1:42:26] <Parapattern> They're screams sound way too human
[1:42:32] <%Caped_Eggy> The screaming make these guys less mindless than original
[1:42:32] <Parapattern> *Their
[1:42:33] <+ChaosAethr> @gstut1 You monster :)
[1:42:37] <seaechiowai> @cobalt_phoenix_ you missed a crazytalk moment
[1:42:40] <rcand9> man watching this just makes me sad i wont be able to get it anytime soon even though i was hoping to dang
[1:42:44] <%superc37> @sermittens unlikely. bp has said in the past that they have no plans for dlc.
[1:42:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @seaechiowai aw fuck
[1:42:51] <%kingmemelord97> so theres no bonfires or mid way stones in this game?
[1:42:54] <%roscoe_rosaline> FUCK that magic sounds good. @PatStaresAt Is there feedback for spells? And if so, is it as good as they sound?
[1:42:57] <%ShineTheDiamond> Neat!
[1:43:01] <$Timesteel> man trying to get summoned on ng+ at tower knight and no one is biting, I just want the trophy LUL
[1:43:01] <%ajvstheworld> So smexy.
[1:43:02] <RyuuAoi> COWARD
[1:43:04] <+ChaosAethr> @gstut1 JK
[1:43:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Fake Des fan
[1:43:08] <%kingmemelord97> oh
[1:43:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so bloodborne?
[1:43:12] <%LaughingCatt> better find those shortcuts
[1:43:17] <+Romuken> god the mines look so different
[1:43:18] <RyuuAoi> Play more
[1:43:19] <chromonaut747> so get gud n stock up on grass
[1:43:20] <glass_marcus> You get short cuts SOMETIMES
[1:43:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @kingmemelord97 an archstone pops up after each boss is killed. That's it
[1:43:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> There's shortcuts like always
[1:43:20] <Parapattern> It's lots of shortcuts
[1:43:22] <vayabutt> yooo do you and Woolz plan on playing this together too??
[1:43:22] <%crimsonharvest> Oh so Contra?
[1:43:24] <%SaiyanShoto> It makes the run back to the boss a pain if you die
[1:43:28] <seaechiowai> @cobalt_phoenix_ maybe 5 min ago. so check in the vod
[1:43:29] <+twohitgood> they don't all have shortcuts, either.
[1:43:30] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt They added a new shortcut in Boletaria though...
[1:43:32] <%Solid_Stro> What about Blood Echoes? doodDerp
[1:43:34] <jon651> Just like Bloodborne
[1:43:41] <%T_Sasquatch> I always hated boss runs
[1:43:46] <+Quack_of_Dawn> The non-estus nature, though, amkes the way there quite doable, though, it seems
[1:43:47] <RyuuAoi> Jerk the boss
[1:43:54] <%ShineTheDiamond> Soooo pretttty!
[1:43:58] <%kingmemelord97> oh well glad im watching pat play it then i couldnt handel that
[1:44:14] <%T_Sasquatch> Literally the most discouraging thing about retrying a boss. Running through an area again
[1:44:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I've never played any soulsborne except bloodborne, so forgive my dumb questions: does mana regen on its own or do you need like a potion for it
[1:44:29] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt OMG The Lizard lit the dead body up
[1:44:34] <%patriotrenegade> did that gecko do a Psycho Crusher
[1:44:37] <+buffn99> The only boss runs that suck are penetrator and allant
[1:44:46] <DSD24> Heavy Soul Arrow
[1:44:47] <%G_Thunders> Since the load times after dying are 2-3 seconds it makes boss runs less bad, at least
[1:44:47] <Evil_Pineapple> great heavy soul nut
[1:44:50] <+superkeaton> Soul Arrow is gun
[1:44:52] <passione13> Do enemies stay dead at least?
[1:44:54] <+falineth> MAGIC MISSILE
[1:44:58] <GameOver_Here> What's this magic user Woolie build bullshit?
[1:45:00] <+Romuken> nut souls
[1:45:00] <someguynamedboots> oh damn
[1:45:01] <Profmcstevie> Magic is treated as a powerful force, as opposed to being an "alternative" attack type
[1:45:01] <%LaughingCatt> Old Hero run aint so great either
[1:45:05] <%preeeow> Cheer1000 hey pat, just finished aegis rim. favorite thing I've played in a while, thank christ you streamed it cuz i had NEVER heard a thing about it
[1:45:06] <%Caped_Eggy> Penetrator is great, he penetrates Kappa
[1:45:07] <%Solid_Stro> Smack that doggo
[1:45:08] <%roscoe_rosaline> Does the spell have haptic feedback?
[1:45:10] <fakespecialist> "yes i will save and quit to get those items"
[1:45:12] <%mikessdd> just blow that spirit gun all over
[1:45:12] <%juxtest> @cobalt_phoenix_ Pat has a magic ring that regenerates his mana, normally it needs an item to be restored
[1:45:13] <%T_Sasquatch> Magic ResidentSleeper
[1:45:14] <%superc37> @cobalt_phoenix_ normally, no. you can make it regen with upgrades or ring.
[1:45:14] <mr_red117> nope, alkl enemies resapwn when you die
[1:45:14] <someguynamedboots> why is this my first time ever seeing pat live
[1:45:15] <Dannzzyy> Man I wanna play this already.
[1:45:17] <%cbunc> cbunc subscribed with Prime.
[1:45:18] <fakespecialist> my mind goblins are screaming pat
[1:45:20] <%KaiserMario> Having a regen MP ring and a crescent weapon helps also...
[1:45:24] <+twohitgood> 4-2 run is pretty bad.
[1:45:25] <%patriotrenegade> Computer system cooled by cum, call that Skynut
[1:45:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oof, thanks for the info
[1:45:29] <fakespecialist> please get those items
[1:45:30] <+Romuken> @GameOver_Here nah it aint a Woolie build. He ain't screaming to drop a shield
[1:45:32] <bobxmaker> honestly this game is so true to the original that i barely see a point in replaying it if i've allready played lots of DeS, but if i we're picking up a ps5 i'd get it just like a formality.
[1:45:33] <VritraReiRei> @patstaresat this almost feels like a sequel, how world you feel if they pulled a FF7R?
[1:45:34] <DSD24> That's why you kill every enemy
[1:45:36] <huskarl_zap> flamefucker is the worst
[1:45:39] <seaechiowai> @gameover_here snailbourne is eternal
[1:45:48] <+twohitgood> old hero is easy but the run to him is rough.
[1:45:48] <%emperordread> Biorr of the Twin Fang is the Solaire before Solaire
[1:45:50] <+vampireinarm> I open the stream and first thing I hear is "THE FULL PENETRATOR"
[1:45:50] <%patriotrenegade> Tower Knight isnt great
[1:45:50] <cosmeleon> @twohitgood it aint as bad if ya get the shortcut open
[1:45:51] <+eanscrale> Just bring the thief ring
[1:45:54] <$Timesteel> King Allant got a shortcut
[1:45:57] <2deep5u> and nobody dies to dirty colossus and leechmonger
[1:46:00] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt OMG HAVE U SEEN THE PYRAMID PS5 ON THE SUB REDDIT?
[1:46:01] <warmnoid> i fell to my death so many times running to flamelurker
[1:46:04] <jorniev> armored spider can still cheesed and flamelurker can still be cheesed
[1:46:06] <RyuuAoi> Dont cry whe n Reggie use magic , Pat . Tell Woolie
[1:46:07] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Does the game control better?
[1:46:15] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt man the dwarves look super fudged in this game. They were nasty before, but now they're nasty in hi-def
[1:46:18] <%KaiserMario> They mitigated Allant with the new shortcut, you can just skip the Blue Dragon now...
[1:46:22] <%Solid_Stro> Leechmonger, Dirty Colossus, and Adjudicator are a joke
[1:46:27] <RichochetForce> Reggie will become a Tru Wizard
[1:46:27] <Parapattern> That's why you need cat jpeg
[1:46:32] <huskarl_zap> oh getting to him
[1:46:35] <+hax_metatron> Honestly I breezed through this remake. My muscle memory of 10000s of Souls games hours meant a focused groove just took me through it
[1:46:36] <%LaughingCatt> for False King, yuup
[1:46:38] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Holy shit, wait. Does your magic energy regen in this game?
[1:46:47] <+Quack_of_Dawn> They removed cat jpeg
[1:46:51] <%bevyrage> yeah, new shortcut in the area everyone was wondering why there wasn't one. think it's in 1-4? or 1-3
[1:46:53] <+twohitgood> @Pigg1yJuffs he has an MP regen ring.
[1:46:56] <Cerabret100> no its his ring that regens mp
[1:46:56] <$Timesteel> yup
[1:46:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you gonna use the corner strat for Armor Spider?
[1:46:58] <+Quack_of_Dawn> It is now stylized
[1:46:59] <%gstut1> pat has magic regen ring
[1:47:03] <%roscoe_rosaline> 0/10 no cat jpeg
[1:47:03] <%G_Thunders> Cat jpeg is in the credits now, I think.
[1:47:06] <jorniev> the cat jpeg still shows up in the credits
[1:47:10] <%LaughingCatt> Also Crescent Falchion regens MP
[1:47:10] <BaronVonProlix> hey pat how is the souls of demons so far?
[1:47:14] <%Solid_Stro> @quack_of_dawn psaWink
[1:47:15] <%emperordread> Biorr amazed me so much that I went full poise in every souls game ever since (even in 3 where it doesn't work)
[1:47:18] <bobxmaker> aka ring of OP
[1:47:19] <%gstut1> pich asshole
[1:47:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ehhh?? Easy Modo?
[1:47:23] <%logoth_> Doesn the +1 falchion also regen MP?
[1:47:33] <%mikessdd> it's a ring you will never take off lol
[1:47:34] <RyuuAoi> We still a Shitstorm over on Woolie Vs.
[1:47:40] <BaronVonProlix> it certainly does look awesome
[1:47:43] <+eanscrale> It's good paint
[1:47:43] <Aydarkzero> this game needed it for sure
[1:47:48] <jon651> Did people figure out the Hidden Door puzzle?
[1:47:58] <%bevyrage> i forgot about that too
[1:48:01] <Aydarkzero> yep the same for Blessed Weapons healing you
[1:48:07] <RyuuAoi> And I like it!
[1:48:12] <rhovybear> @PatStaresAt did you warp pipe to 4-1?
[1:48:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> asides from looking better, how different is it from the original?
[1:48:20] <Aydarkzero> MP ring
[1:48:21] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Still, any sort of magic regen in this game may actually get me to try out a spellcaster run. That's my biggest gripes with any of the other Souls games magic, the extreme limitations on use.
[1:48:24] <+Romuken> i just blue filter the screen
[1:48:26] <%mikessdd> oh yeah stacked blessings. Forgot that's a thing
[1:48:28] <rhovybear> Every time i hear the level names in this game i just think mario
[1:48:30] <%LegendGHT> it might be a tendency thing to open that door
[1:48:41] <+Romuken> make it piss mustard yellow
[1:48:42] <%LaughingCatt> Regen Build!
[1:48:47] <Aydarkzero> my first build was Blessed Knight Sword w/ Regen Ring and MP ring LUL
[1:48:48] <%juxtest> Stink Ring
[1:48:54] <%Laecerelius> Regen ring and the adjucator's shield
[1:48:55] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@SirKeigan) (warning)
[1:48:55] <+eanscrale> Oh yeah, never die EVER
[1:48:56] <redrins> the game lets you make some busted ass fun builds
[1:48:57] <%Agami23> did that skeleton just fall through the floor?
[1:48:59] <$Timesteel> the 4-1 skip is still there too
[1:49:01] <londorpaleale> regen degen
[1:49:07] <Aydarkzero> so much fun
[1:49:10] <%AzureGale> SUPER. FUN.
[1:49:14] <%SirKeigan> I didn't mean to post a link, don't even know how I did
[1:49:20] <%blue8moon> I really wish magic was viable in other souls games
[1:49:23] <+twohitgood> scraping spear is still the same, i think.
[1:49:23] <RyuuAoi> BUST A NUT
[1:49:25] <SGrim> Regeneracy Degeneracy PogChamp
[1:49:27] <%mikessdd> Break the game people. The cheese is good
[1:49:29] <%superc37> they were also damn near impossible in pvp
[1:49:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> SUPER
[1:49:33] <Aydarkzero> they kind of are
[1:49:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> FUN
[1:49:37] <LunarRemix> It's strong on DS1
[1:49:38] <%gstut1> @Timesteel it is ? i spent like 10 mins trying to do it
[1:49:42] <Cerabret100> Its super viable in all the dark souls
[1:49:43] <@commanderclaw> I wish Faith was viable in any souls game
[1:49:43] <+buffn99> Its viable in every souls game
[1:49:45] <%trustycoyote> In DS3 with Cinders it totally is
[1:49:50] <+eanscrale> It's kinda rough until you get soul spear
[1:49:50] <+superkeaton> pretty viable in 2
[1:49:51] <Aydarkzero> it's just Demon's had the strongest magic aside from Hexes
[1:49:55] <chaos2frozen> they're all viable, the problem isn't it being weak, it's being boring
[1:49:56] <%Ynkubus_> Its viable in all of them but the power cap varie
[1:49:59] <%UvBenServed> Remember when lightning spears were the shit in DS2?
[1:50:01] <%Valdorick> In 2 was so viable that it got nerfed CONSTANTLY
[1:50:01] <TheMadBadger> It's not as viable in DS2/3.
[1:50:02] <%SirKeigan> In DS3 more enemies are weak to fire and dark than they are to magic
[1:50:06] <alphonseisbest> ITS PETTY GOOD IN BLOODBORNE
[1:50:08] <%LegendGHT> he's not bl- Onyx anymore?
[1:50:14] <%KaiserMario> The main problem isn't the Regen ring, the problem is the Blessed weapons and the Adju Shield that scale the Regen with upgrades
[1:50:15] <+sermittens> Did pat get to the dragon god?
[1:50:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> in 3 it sucks ass
[1:50:16] <%roscoe_rosaline> God, it explodes AROUND the beam?
[1:50:17] <%Laecerelius> Yeah
[1:50:18] <jinjabreadman757> that animation tho
[1:50:18] <%LaughingCatt> yes. yes it can
[1:50:22] <Aydarkzero> bleed + magic + magic regen
[1:50:23] <%SirKeigan> Why wouldn't it?
[1:50:24] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[1:50:24] <%WhereIsWill> thats sick
[1:50:25] <jinjabreadman757> yep
[1:50:26] <Cerabret100> should say on the stat sheet if it has bleed
[1:50:28] <Parapattern> BUS TED
[1:50:31] <%Laecerelius> All curved weapons have bleed effects on them I think
[1:50:34] <%saadi90> Yessir

[1:51:22] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Magic was viable in other Souls games. I just didn't like using because I have mind goblins like Pat due to the limitations on use.
[1:51:25] <%bevyrage> do not pull the zangief trigger @MyNameIsRasus
[1:51:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> psaBig psaDogchamp psaMenace psaMenace
[1:51:46] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt is the Scrapping Spear still a a problem or is it noting?

[1:52:22] <jon651> Will you ever do a Pure Black run?
[1:52:27] <%trustycoyote> @MyNameIsRasus ok dat pretty good
[1:52:29] <Parapattern> What could it be?
[1:52:30] <%bevyrage> @ChaosAethr yes, it's still a problem because it eats 10 durability per hit and the hit counts on I-frames too
[1:52:30] <Joem1k> hey everyone

[1:53:59] <%Xelhesia> yup
[1:54:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong Pat
[1:54:06] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig FACTS
[1:54:07] <%Nomenanza> what is the usage of dualsense in this game?
[1:54:09] <%T_Sasquatch> Dabadee
[1:54:11] <boardscanada> no covenants though in Demon's Souls is a huge downgrade
[1:54:12] <Parapattern> It's such a light touch. It's perfect
[1:54:15] <%roscoe_rosaline> @Punchasaur Hell yeah they are.
[1:54:16] <%leinadtonu> easior
[1:54:17] <ezackazneyes> cheer569 i always preferred nioh over the souls series. they upgraded so much from the formula!!
[1:54:22] <DSD24> Gravelord worked what are you talking about
[1:54:24] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT THE CHEATER LEGACY ROOM
[1:54:27] <%juxtest> BLUE PHANTOM GOOD RED PHANTOM BAD
[1:54:33] <+eanscrale> ForEVER
[1:54:35] <%Monkeyweed21> that is super wrong Pat
[1:54:37] <RyuuAoi> Cowardice
[1:54:41] <TheMadBadger> Idk, password summoning made it really good for helping friends in DS3
[1:54:48] <+zetastriker> You lose levels don't you?
[1:54:51] <%dekkitout> What's up with games wanting to improve on a system that works- only for it to be logarithmically worse?
[1:54:52] <boardscanada> wasn't the pvp completely busted in demon's souls?
[1:54:52] <+zetastriker> If you die in an invasion?
[1:54:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:54:57] <%SirKeigan> Because we said so
[1:54:57] <%T_Sasquatch> I would never be a summon. Im too afraid of fucking up
[1:54:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> your perception of reality is wrong
[1:54:59] <%brachydios777> Apparently WB is finally caving in and releasing Wonder Woman 1985 on HBO Max
[1:55:01] <abuse_of_zeus> because THEIR personal experience is right
[1:55:03] <+zetastriker> And there's no weapon scaling
[1:55:04] <%arkv01> your reality is incorrect, we will now correct it for you
[1:55:06] <%rdark_ksu> because its yours Pat
[1:55:11] <%SomeSageAdvice> wrong as in morally or wrong as in factually @Monkeyweed21
[1:55:11] <Sunstalker> running casting is fucked though. But the latency is way more stable in des in general for fight clubs
[1:55:12] <%T_Sasquatch> psaBig psaWrong
[1:55:13] <%Puhff> like that
[1:55:15] <iheartmota> dark souls 2 pvp was thriving at launch cause phantoms could get invaded
[1:55:16] <danknugglit> Jolly cooperation
[1:55:16] <%T_Sasquatch> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:55:17] <Aydarkzero> it's fun though
[1:55:17] <%AzureGale> ok
[1:55:21] <%Monkeyweed21> DeS online is let down by how absurdly unbalanced the game is
[1:55:23] <%WhereIsWill> its all about the randos
[1:55:24] <%logoth_> Why is that guy covered in fart mist
[1:55:24] <%Punchasaur> but it exists
[1:55:26] <%Ynkubus_> Co-op just stomped regardless
[1:55:28] <%stabbityrabbit> psaBig psaWrong
[1:55:30] <%TinyLittleDancer> Personal experience is literally wrong all the time. We get rose colored glasses for a reason and its because we suck at actually being objective
[1:55:32] <huskarl_zap> everything is permitted
[1:55:35] <+coldsama> it's fun, you can so stupid builds
[1:55:35] <%SirKeigan> You think it's only supposed to be randoms because the nature of the way this world works?
[1:55:35] <agrocraig01> gotta have friends pat
[1:55:37] <Aydarkzero> i do like helping randoms with bosses though
[1:55:41] <%RoboticAnimeDude> oh so elitist dark souls pat
[1:55:47] <$RealThiele> no friends, only enemies
[1:55:47] <JayEarly> bork
[1:55:55] <jinjabreadman757> I liked when they added PvP arenas in DS3 but I can see where Pat is coming from
[1:55:55] <chromonaut747> ds2 had the best multiplayer sans- soul memory
[1:55:58] <RyuuAoi> One guy think everyone wen thruogh what hedid
[1:55:58] <%T_Sasquatch> Dark souls pvp aka backstab no jutsu
[1:56:00] <Parapattern> Where is this guy going?
[1:56:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @SomeSageAdvice factualy, its hard to do good pvp in a game with such poor balance
[1:56:04] <%SirKeigan> @doc_ock_rokc He hasn't died in awhile. Feeling okay?
[1:56:04] <+eanscrale> smae
[1:56:14] <2deep5u> the webs are a lot more transparent now
[1:56:14] <+Romuken> smash spoods
[1:56:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk, I had a blast going through bloodborne with a firend
[1:56:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeah
[1:56:18] <%G_Thunders> DeS PVP was great because it wasn’t trying to really be competitive. There’s so much jank, broken builds that balance never mattered
[1:56:20] <%Punchasaur> all souls fans are elitists in some way
[1:56:21] <Evil_Pineapple> he dies PepeHands
[1:56:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but hey everyone's different
[1:56:24] <londorpaleale> Invading friends though...
[1:56:25] <TheWiggly> why have they never made a friends-only soapstone? that seems like the easiest way
[1:56:25] <HeroToxiko> ds2 iron bridge profaned flame and lingering flame trolling finished off the dragon bs for me lol
[1:56:27] <%Agami23> i think the best online implementation was when you could glitch DS3 to let you invade bossfights.
[1:56:32] <%greasypete00> playing with a friend is fun like once and then not really afterwards
[1:56:33] <%Solid_Stro> Do you not believe in the power of friendship Pat doodStare
[1:56:34] <%crimsonharvest> PLaying with a friend as a gimmick dual-caestus crew is fun in ds2
[1:56:36] <%juxtest> Hes gonna move that boulder with his mind
[1:56:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it felt jank af
[1:56:41] <RyuuAoi> PJSalt one guy
[1:56:43] <ItYaboiDrew> Are u liking the game so far pat
[1:56:44] <Naho_Saenoki> @Agami23 Agreed.
[1:56:46] <agrocraig01> "friends, I don't get it." - Pat
[1:56:46] <%DianaTheAscian> how?
[1:56:46] <%Puhff> elitist=anything i don't like
[1:56:50] <+hax_metatron> @patstaresat Do the High Five emote!!!!!!
[1:56:51] <%Monkeyweed21> the saving grace of DeS PvP was that no one played DeS so there was never a hard meta
[1:56:51] <%T_Sasquatch> Friends am i rite
[1:56:54] <%patriotrenegade> the bell you mean?
[1:56:55] <+SuicidalLemmming> sounds like a personal problem
[1:56:56] <londorpaleale> Killing the bell lady is too easy
[1:56:58] <%G_Thunders> Chalice dungeon co-op was fun
[1:56:58] <Ipsenscastle> that's weird I did a ton of multiplayer in BB and my internet sucks
[1:57:00] <%LegendGHT> what about Jolly Cooperation
[1:57:00] <boardscanada> demons souls completely lacks any pvp classes like gravelord right? there's only you being summoned as a boss and blue phantoms?

[1:58:31] <%brachydios777> Those loading times though
[1:58:33] <Evil_Pineapple> a well telegraphed attack
[1:58:34] <Gc478xf> DxCat DxCat DxCat
[1:58:35] <Aydarkzero> it's awesome
[1:58:37] <JayEarly> i get no one in most of Bloodborne but the fucking nightmare frontier is non-stop invasions
[1:58:37] <%Punchasaur> these new sound effects make me wanna try being a mage. they sound satisfying
[1:58:39] <%Monkeyweed21> they alread have SSDs
[1:58:39] <%bevyrage> @Ipsenscastle don't be on the floor when it fire
[1:58:41] <%G_Thunders> @ipsenscastle you run away from the oil as it spreads out
[1:58:42] <agrocraig01> floor on fire, run away
[1:58:45] <2deep5u> what is the spider's purpose, being down there?
[1:58:47] <Explodincatz> play is now gameable
[1:58:47] <chromonaut747> i REALLY hope this does come out for the PC
[1:58:47] <+zetastriker> I've always wondered what the intended strat for this boss is. I've only seen it killed via cheese, even in my own playthrough
[1:58:48] <%juxtest> wtf does Spiderstone do
[1:58:50] <Naho_Saenoki> @Ipsenscastle By seeing it's happening, and running to the entrance to dodge it.
[1:58:50] <%T_Sasquatch> Rip loading screens
[1:58:50] <%Puhff> umbassa
[1:58:54] <RyuuAoi> At first you don't succeed...
[1:58:58] <%vectorless_peon> pc already has it
[1:59:00] <redrins> its the shit
[1:59:01] <Parapattern> Mother Fucking Kris Blade
[1:59:02] <Ipsenscastle> fair enough
[1:59:02] <%SirKeigan> Spiderstone for Spider Bow
[1:59:03] <%Solid_Stro> I still shutter to remember Bloodborne’s load times at launch doodOuch
[1:59:05] <theanora1> Going to try out some of the slower loading PS4 games on the 5?
[1:59:05] <%WhereIsWill> that sword looks sick
[1:59:05] <%BinaryFireball> sony really focused on immersion this gen and it has paid off big
[1:59:06] <%T_Sasquatch> Who needs loading screen games LUL
[1:59:13] <RyuuAoi> ....dust yourself off and try again.
[1:59:14] <Grandma_Amari> Anyone know what headphones Pat uses when he does? My M50X pair are finally starting to wear out.
[1:59:14] <Aydarkzero> the build grows stronger
[1:59:14] <hifiguy> I want a ps5 but I can't buy it anywhere
[1:59:14] <%bevyrage> do you need it wielded to do that?
[1:59:16] <%roscoe_rosaline> POWAH
[1:59:18] <jon651> 30%!!
[1:59:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now that's a lotta damage
[1:59:18] <bobxmaker> oh yeah the kris
[1:59:19] <%aishman> But what about SHIIIELD
[1:59:20] <Discount_CJ> Isn't that just a Levin sword?
[1:59:23] <redrins> you also take more magic damage iirc
[1:59:24] <%KaiserMario> HOLD IT HARDER
[1:59:25] <$Timesteel> ya heard the direct storage stuff wasn’t be implemented until some time next year
[1:59:34] <ToneBacas> oh remember melee weapons have range sweet spots
[1:59:34] <+vaderxyz1970> Is there a Glamor system in Des?
[1:59:34] <%T_Sasquatch> Pick up your shield
[1:59:34] <%vectorless_peon> its just a matter of if devs utilize m.2 SSD resources well

[1:59:51] <%BinaryFireball> these are more than m2s if I recall
[1:59:59] <%bevyrage> @Timesteel direct storage stuff is already out? i've seen it in a few vids already.
[2:00:02] <%BinaryFireball> special m2s they are
[2:00:05] <Aydarkzero> yo but what if you used it to parry stuff
[2:00:05] <%BinaryFireball> made with candy
[2:00:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt gonna go for the Blueblood sword?
[2:00:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt When are you gonna have Paige try THIS one though?
[2:00:13] <Grandma_Amari> I totally get why people might feel worried tat whatever From makes next won't feel nearly as polished as this.
[2:00:16] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about all the games being $70?
[2:00:16] <Gc478xf> PowerUpL GlitchCat PowerUpR
[2:00:22] <+dingobroyt> but have you got the MP recovery ring still on?
[2:00:25] <%Punchasaur> legend of kris
[2:00:29] <%patriotrenegade> Paige will play this in 2025
[2:00:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you don't already have a PS5 and don't want to pay scalper prices, you ain't getting one this year.
[2:00:36] <%SirKeigan> Incradible?
[2:00:44] <%patriotrenegade> what makes it so good
[2:00:48] <$ezackazneyes> nioh will always shit all over the souls series.
[2:00:49] <+Joe2187> how about demonbrandt?
[2:01:02] <Ipsenscastle> @patriotrenegade Woolie will play it in 2028
[2:01:03] <ScreamLord> Too bad it doesn't have sword beams like it's DS3 equivalent
[2:01:03] <%BinaryFireball> so like I wonder why armies haven't tried to traverse the fog?
[2:01:05] <+hax_metatron> @ezackazneyes LUL
[2:01:05] <%SirKeigan> @rumtumtugnutz not true. I work at Target and someone I work with got one the other night. She stayed up til 2am and got it
[2:01:08] <%Punchasaur> silence, weeb
[2:01:12] <Grandma_Amari> I really want to see DBS's look in the remaster. Is it even more Dragonslayer now?
[2:01:12] <%BinaryFireball> and only dumb hero mens
[2:01:15] <londorpaleale> It always made me sad that you couldn't make the broken swords into something cool in the Dark Souls games
[2:01:18] <%SirKeigan> We update inventory at weird times cuz of overnight workers
[2:01:19] <seaechiowai> after the moonlight greatsword right? Kappa
[2:01:24] <%mikessdd> nioh 2 felt bad though
[2:01:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ezackazneyes I mean Nioh 2 feels less like Souls and more like Onimusha tho
[2:01:28] <%RoboticAnimeDude> nioh and souls coexist in my eyes, bot h amazing in different ways
[2:01:29] <jorniev> TO THE LEFT
[2:01:29] <Aydarkzero> man
[2:01:30] <Noogiez> hahaha
[2:01:32] <redrins> LUL

[2:01:38] <jon651> damn
[2:01:39] <$renyrells> what a jobber
[2:01:41] <%SirKeigan> Get a better shield, like the Purple Flame Shield from 1-1
[2:01:41] <%patriotrenegade> good try
[2:01:42] <bobxmaker> wow pat, that was not even a fight :D
[2:01:43] <%Monkeyweed21> fake fan

[2:01:48] <Explodincatz> eat that dmg
[2:01:49] <ToneBacas> the SSD to GPU memory thing on windows is called DirectStorage
[2:01:51] <+Grayhammatter> bitched, like a jobber
[2:01:52] <jon651> the wombo
[2:01:52] <Cerabret100> Wait so if i one shot this am i better than Pat (The answer is no but i'll pretend it does)
[2:01:53] <%G_Thunders> You have to hit him
[2:01:56] <uretrafaia> graphics look amazing btw.
[2:01:59] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, Nioh feels more like Onimusha + Ninja Gaiden
[2:02:01] <EuropanLamprey> It's Freja but cooler
[2:02:02] <%BigCoffee> @VHGS It's also one of the easiest bosses in the game
[2:02:04] <+coldsama> The sound design is good wow
[2:02:04] <%Solid_Stro> Looks like this Spider gots your number psaBougie
[2:02:06] <+chvmpchange> smash cut to pat making fun of woolie during armor spider
[2:02:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @SirKeigan That's cool. I'm not sure how working at Target fits into that, but good on 'em. MOST LIKELY you're notg etting one this year if you're not willing to pay scalper prices.
[2:02:10] <Grandma_Amari> I don't think I've ever managed to do armored spider first try in a run
[2:02:13] <%juxtest> Maybe you need to summon All_Is_Fiction
[2:02:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> @PatStaresAt Gun to your head: best souls game shortcut?
[2:02:18] <seaechiowai> you got vibe checked
[2:02:31] <+Joe2187> @BinaryFireball Phalanx is what happened to the last army that did
[2:02:31] <%moogleboy1984> @Cerabret100 The answer is "If you exist, you're better than Pat"
[2:02:32] <+TheCoobie> Try a parry with it?
[2:02:37] <RecklessPrinny> yo wait pats using magic
[2:02:39] <+chvmpchange> undead chapel elevator
[2:02:40] <%Punchasaur> nioh has horrible repetitiveness and qol problems
[2:02:44] <uretrafaia> was thinking of getting Nioh, actually. its on sale on Steam
[2:02:47] <%SirKeigan> @rumtumtugnutz She didn't get any special benefits from being an employee. My point is that anyone can do that, just get lucky
[2:02:57] <EuropanLamprey> So it's basically the Scholar's Candle Stick from DS3, but is it actually usable as a weapon? The SCS sucked as an actual weapon
[2:03:01] <ToneBacas> @Punchasaur and it's a looter game. no bueno
[2:03:02] <Cerabret100> @moogleboy1984 i mean, he's way better than me at DMC so i don't know if thats true
[2:03:04] <Aydarkzero> @Punchasaur reason i didn't bother w/ the sequel tbh
[2:03:05] <Gc478xf> RalpherZ RalpherZ RalpherZ
[2:03:08] <%MyNameIsRasus> @uretrafaia it's a great game man
[2:03:11] <%Punchasaur> not to mention artificial difficulty
[2:03:18] <$ezackazneyes> listen chat, anything the souls series can do, nioh will always do better!
[2:03:26] <AFlyingTaco1> Man I was watching Peeve playing some PVP in this the other day, and it was just filthy.
[2:03:28] <seaechiowai> @mynameisrasus he didn't care for your gun LUL
[2:03:36] <+twohitgood> i wonder why they added a door there?
[2:03:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> @SirKeigan I didn;t say anything about employees getting special advantage, I was more implying a supply vs. demand vs. bots.
[2:03:41] <Aydarkzero> @ezackazneyes hard disagree
[2:03:42] <%RoboticAnimeDude> nioh 2 is the best
[2:03:45] <bobxmaker> btw pat, love that you're using magic, it's so freaking rare to see, all you see is strength build a lá unga bunga.
[2:03:45] <+Joe2187> DeS PVP was never fair
[2:03:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> @seaechiowai sure didn't LUL
[2:03:48] <Grandma_Amari> I forget, could you left hand stuff in Demons Souls? Like use a shield in your right hand instead and it'll actually block?
[2:03:52] <Mirrorcatch> the fat evil returns
[2:03:55] <%SirKeigan> Gotcha. I'm just saying it's not impossible.
[2:03:57] <Aydarkzero> oof
[2:03:57] <$ezackazneyes> @Aydarkzero how so?
[2:04:02] <%roscoe_rosaline> WTF
[2:04:05] <Explodincatz> fire hot
[2:04:05] <fakespecialist> that is janky af
[2:04:05] <Parapattern> PS3 Annihilator Room
[2:04:05] <ToneBacas> toasty
[2:04:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just listen to him he's having such a good time
[2:04:06] <Arek_1> Man, when I first beat the Armoured Spider in the OG, I had the Purple Flame Shield in my right hand and Winged Spear in left hand. Fire attacks? Two-hand the shield. I just didn't know that you could avoid the flame carpet.
[2:04:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fact is, if somewhere comes up with stock, unless you;'re lucky they're going to get bought up by bots
[2:04:13] <%T_Sasquatch> Hehehe
[2:04:13] <+chvmpchange> nioh feels like ass to play imo I hate that it doesn't support proper rebounding of controls on pc
[2:04:16] <%BinaryFireball> why no magic fatman?
[2:04:21] <Gc478xf> GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat
[2:04:22] <amonimis> can you parry their melee attacks?
[2:04:23] <%Xelhesia> look at this mega fat evil
[2:04:27] <$ezackazneyes> even the graphics look atheistically better!
[2:04:30] <+chvmpchange> rebinding*
[2:04:31] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes you are hilariously wrong
[2:04:33] <$ezackazneyes> nioh always prevails!
[2:04:34] <%dellakitty> Winston Churchill?
[2:04:36] <%SirKeigan> I like that you get a fast roll no matter what compared to DS1
[2:04:45] <Aydarkzero> @ezackazneyes felt like it never wanted to end sure the combats better but it's stances never felt all that useful
[2:04:51] <Gc478xf> CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[2:04:51] <%SirKeigan> That's a good axe
[2:04:53] <+Grayhammatter> mega fat evil
[2:04:55] <mr_red117> oh they ruined the fat officials laugh!
[2:04:55] <%juxtest> Not so fat no more
[2:05:01] <+chvmpchange> hard disagree on nioh's aesthetic
[2:05:02] <+campasino> Ni-Oh just started downloading... What am I in for?
[2:05:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Justin Trudeau
[2:05:05] <$ezackazneyes> @Aydarkzero thats cuz u were using them wrong!
[2:05:10] <+Joe2187> only fast roll with half equip load otherwise more than that is fat roll
[2:05:12] <Ipsenscastle> this boss run is pretty horrible
[2:05:12] <%RoboticAnimeDude> souls is more about the level design and atmosphere to me with nioh i get more in the builds and combat
[2:05:13] <iheartmota> pain
[2:05:14] <+hax_metatron> Yeah seriously Nioh is a good Souls clone but I feel I’m losing my mind when people put it up there with Souls games. From games are something else. They rise above just combat and mechanics and lore, it’s the combination and mystery that is unmatched
[2:05:21] <%greasypete00> is this your first playthrough pat
[2:05:25] <Aydarkzero> @ezackazneyes but i was using stance switching all the time!
[2:05:25] <$ezackazneyes> listen chat, nioh's stamina system is infinitely better!
[2:05:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when Woolie thought that Nioh was better than Sekiro lol
[2:05:31] <Aydarkzero> :(
[2:05:43] <%Faustgesicht> Why did they change the fat official so much?
[2:05:49] <%BinaryFireball> no medium roll?
[2:05:55] <%Garthunox> @Monkeyweed21 Nioh IS better than Sekiro
[2:05:56] <DSD24> Nioh's great though
[2:05:57] <%BinaryFireball> just fast and slow?
[2:05:59] <Aydarkzero> pretty much
[2:06:02] <%dekkitout> COWARDS
[2:06:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> Probably
[2:06:02] <jorniev> JUST GO BEHIND THE PILLAR IN THE LEFT
[2:06:03] <%SirKeigan> DS1 roll was so hindering
[2:06:03] <AFlyingTaco1> @ezackazneyes The game's core gameplay revolves around it. Of course it's better than Souls.
[2:06:05] <+MrTAteMyBalls> bbbbuh?
[2:06:07] <%mikessdd> I hate Sekiro but it's ebcause I am bad at game
[2:06:10] <iheartmota> i mean he was purple
[2:06:12] <+Feralspirit41> Wish theyd kept his laugh though
[2:06:17] <%SirKeigan> LUL walked right into it
[2:06:18] <+Feralspirit41> much more iconic imo
[2:06:19] <alphonseisbest> WHICH AS A BLACK MAN IS DUMB

[2:06:25] <$ezackazneyes> @AFlyingTaco1 i love it when companies take a genre and make it better!
[2:06:26] <DSD24> Man Armor Spider had that specific noise though
[2:06:27] <+CannonHeroBrett> walked right into them LUL
[2:06:28] <londorpaleale> I wonder if high SL pvp is still gonna be 2kat and dual DBS
[2:06:28] <Talinu> Nioh is an action game with soul-ish elements.
[2:06:30] <%SirKeigan> I think you have to roll that
[2:06:30] <alphonseisbest> HE WAS OBSIDIAN
[2:06:31] <%KaiserMario> He was purple face...
[2:06:31] <%AzureGale> We touhou now
[2:06:33] <%linSP> THE CHEESE CORNER
[2:06:33] <trfurkanrey18> Cheeeseee
[2:06:39] <%G_Thunders> Was there a reason the fat official looked so weird in the original? Like, I remember thinking there’d be a payoff or answer to whatever they were, but I can’t remember one
[2:06:40] <iheartmota> cheese
[2:06:40] <jorniev> YEAAAAAAAAAAH CHOESE

[2:07:51] <+jt427> honestly this boss aint great so i dont blame the cheese
[2:07:52] <trfurkanrey18> You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.

[2:08:35] <rjhascancer> go lvl up!
[2:08:37] <%mikessdd> Nioh depends alot on equipment. Most of the time you can scum it by just having a bigger number than being good at the game. I know since I actually beat it
[2:08:41] <+Romuken> ?
[2:08:42] <%Laecerelius> GASP!
[2:08:42] <%Eaglestrike117> but world tendency?
[2:08:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I missed it
[2:08:45] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes your argument sucks dick lmao
[2:08:48] <+CapnClassix> Did they keep the Online World tendency shit?
[2:08:49] <xSHARKPUNCHx> they changed it
[2:08:53] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt I didn't know Demon's Souls was a tower defense game.
[2:08:54] <%KaiserMario> 10k souls tho...
[2:08:55] <$ezackazneyes> @mikessdd same with souls.
[2:08:55] <+TrophyTy> Just came here to find out when the next yakoozi stream would be but i gotta sub to watch right away. Chat, How long till vods go up on youtube normally? Sorry if this is annoying not trying to be a pest. Would sub if i could. Love U pat you are greatest <3
[2:08:58] <xSHARKPUNCHx> online doesnt effect tendency anymore
[2:09:04] <$ezackazneyes> @Punchasaur no it isnt.
[2:09:05] <%T_Sasquatch> Don't say it like that LUL
[2:09:06] <actualemu> Lunarhawk just called you a bitch, he told me so himself
[2:09:10] <+CapnClassix> Online always made tendency so pointless
[2:09:10] <iheartmota> what do you mean?
[2:09:11] <%mikessdd> @ezackazneyes yeppp
[2:09:13] <seaechiowai> psaBig explain

[2:09:18] <ToneBacas> wait what
[2:09:22] <AFlyingTaco1> @DeAtIvAtE_cHaNnEl I think it's two days after the stream, but I'm not 100% sure
[2:09:23] <%KaiserMario> WELL THEN...
[2:09:26] <+CapnClassix> it just stayed neutral all the time essentially
[2:09:26] <tattleworm> the interview they gave said it did so idk
[2:09:27] <%Garthunox> @mikessdd I beat it too and unless you're using absolutely broken bullshit stuff you still need to be actually good at the game
[2:09:28] <+hax_metatron> LIESSSSS
[2:09:29] <+Grayhammatter> are you sure about that?
[2:09:30] <Arek_1> Bluepoint: "Fat Official? Can't be black. Useless Crestfallen Warrior? Turn him black." LUL

[2:09:34] <$ezackazneyes> @mikessdd listen mike, i know ur a souls fanboy but u cant deny the facts!
[2:09:36] <%Garthunox> Guess what, I beat it too
[2:09:38] <+hax_metatron> Don’t believe it. It’s the same LUL
[2:09:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Taking advantage of mechanics isn't cheating. Maybe it's a little cheese-scented, but it's not like he's breaking the game to do it.
[2:09:43] <actualemu> Lunarhawk just called you a bitch, he told me so himself
[2:09:43] <scrublord009> SAUCE
[2:09:47] <iheartmota> the developer said tendies was unchanged
[2:09:49] <+TrophyTy> @AFlyingTaco1 Thank you for the reply! Hopefully I can handle that. Bless you. <3
[2:09:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> Source: Counter Strike
[2:09:49] <ToneBacas> but i watched people change their tendency my PVP
[2:09:50] <+Joe2187> it only effects tendency is if you die in human form or get killed by a black phantom
[2:09:51] <xSHARKPUNCHx> i am 100% sure i was able to keep pure white getting all the trophies
[2:09:53] <%Garthunox> So stop being an elitist gatekeeping asshole Mike
[2:09:55] <ToneBacas> by PVP i mean

[2:10:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> WITHOUT SOME GODDAMN SAUCE
[2:10:11] <Aliensigma> @patstaresat Online 100% does not affect tendency
[2:10:11] <+hax_metatron> @ezackazneyes History will remember Dark Souls; go have fun with Nioh
[2:10:11] <Arek_1> It used to in the OG.
[2:10:13] <+Joe2187> ONLY IF YOU GET KILLED IN HUMAN OR MURDERED BY BLACK PHANTOM
[2:10:21] <%linSP> digger king looks whiter
[2:10:21] <%SirKeigan> The fact that the broken archstone is there just proves it's gonna get used
[2:10:25] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> it would change based on other players before
[2:10:28] <actualemu> Lunarhawk just called you a bitch, he told me so himself
[2:10:29] <iheartmota> need an official source
[2:10:29] <%zestyArsenic> source: trust me bro
[2:10:33] <Grandma_Amari> Land of Giants archstone being not fixed is still a bummer, but I get they wanted to be faithful and making an entire area mostly from scratch is going a bit above and beyond.
[2:10:33] <TheRealNumberJ42> would have been nice if they made it easier to tell what your tendency is
[2:10:34] <chhdez> You must a pasta so good, it can stand without sauce

[2:10:49] <scrublord009> GIVE ME THE SAUCE
[2:10:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Online only affects tendency if a black phantom kills you @PatStaresAt
[2:10:50] <+TheBitingIrish> @SirKeigan There's a new door in the first zone
[2:10:51] <iheartmota> If you die as a human or Murder a black phantom

[2:11:14] <+PARARScs> world tendency is some trash
[2:11:14] <ToneBacas> i watched someone using PVP to adjust their character tendency to get a specific headpiece

[2:11:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BAN HIM PAT
[2:11:26] <+chvmpchange> Bluepoint said they weren't making the giant archstone. so if it turns out to be dlc they are huge liars

[2:11:34] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes says the guy simping for nioh just because of the weeb aesthetic
[2:11:36] <$linkthoy> @sirkeigan The broken archstone was in world tendency menu in the original.
[2:11:36] <TheRealNumberJ42> what
[2:11:41] <%Jekado> what about battle tendency...
[2:11:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Only invaders killing you affects Tendency
[2:11:42] <+TheBitingIrish> DansGame ?
[2:11:43] <DantesAnimus> Someone quick wake up Germanspy to ask about the tendancy
[2:11:45] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Yeah I can't find anything online about World Tendency not being changed with online stuff
[2:11:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BAN HIS ASS FOR LYING
[2:11:58] <chromonaut747> MURDER
[2:12:00] <%G_Thunders> @chvmpchange except they already said they aren’t making it?
[2:12:00] <NaturalGear> which is also different from Battle Tendency
[2:12:02] <rjhascancer> she sitting at the nexus
[2:12:03] <Sunstalker> on the stairs
[2:12:04] <%SirKeigan> @linkthoy But it didn't have a space where text would go. The new UI makes it look like something is missing
[2:12:05] <Gc478xf> PowerUpL VoteYea PowerUpR
[2:12:08] <$ezackazneyes> @Punchasaur im arguing that nioh does everything souls does but better.
[2:12:09] <Arek_1> What may be happening is that the average WT is so mixed that it's neutral. At the end of the OG's lifetime, it was, like, +1 towards white.
[2:12:11] <$Afterman_> "Playing online can influence your World Tendency, based on the World Tendency of other characters."
[2:12:11] <+chvmpchange> I mean you could literally just test it
[2:12:12] <jorniev> upstaris
[2:12:14] <$Afterman_> from a eurogamer article
[2:12:23] <%CopperTucker> seek seek touch
[2:12:25] <%FacetiousAF> 👀 touch where?
[2:12:28] <ToneBacas> @Monkeyweed21 that's because you can only get invaded outside of the Nexus in Body form, and when you die in body form your tendency drops
[2:12:29] <Aydarkzero> wait so are you looking for character or world tendency changes?
[2:12:31] <iheartmota> Souls has way better level design
[2:12:34] <%BinaryFireball> inside
[2:12:35] <%mikessdd> i want to touch you ON THE INSIDE
[2:12:38] <+DinnerCalzone> strenth
[2:12:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yooooo I'm sure it looks fine on pat's end but those really dark shadows are agressively dark blue/purple
[2:12:44] <chaos2frozen> @chvmpchange who gives a shit? If they made the last stone it's more Demon Souls to enjoy
[2:12:44] <@SoFarFetched> Also remember to be civil with your arguments, you darksouls and nioh fanboys.
[2:12:45] <Grandma_Amari> Something about the Maiden looks off, maybe it's her lips.

[2:13:04] <studleydoorite> did they make her boobs bigger and hair shaggier?
[2:13:04] <+hax_metatron> Souls has way better lore, level design, bosses, spirit. Nioh is a good Souls clone.
[2:13:06] <@SoFarFetched> don't act like I don't see you guys arguing about nioh and dark souls geefPoint
[2:13:08] <+Romuken> From Polygon: "And when played online, the actions of all players in aggregate affect the tendency, which can make the game unpredictable. But there is one small change that veteran Demon’s Souls players will welcome."
[2:13:08] <$ezackazneyes> @iheartmota well i personally think nioh's is more intricate
[2:13:16] <%SirKeigan> blue blood scales with luck up to 30
[2:13:18] <%Monkeyweed21> fake DeS fan confirmed
[2:13:24] <%Chatterbox1991> Can you imagine a souls game that had a World Tendancy mechanic that you had to track with a phone app or something?
[2:13:28] <+Romuken> the change is UI
[2:13:31] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes except you're not arguing anything. you're just saying it does things better but haven't given a single reason
[2:13:35] <iheartmota> souls level design has lore and item placements in mind
[2:13:35] <Parapattern> I miss seeing Ed and Baldwin fist fighting in the loading screens
[2:13:47] <$linkthoy> In des they never did, just slots requirements.
[2:13:55] <Gc478xf> ENDURANCE
[2:13:56] <%roscoe_rosaline> Hell yeah
[2:14:00] <@SoFarFetched> no Pat you're not nice,you're orb.
[2:14:00] <$ezackazneyes> @hax_metatron lore? nioh's story makes sense LUL level design? same. LUL same with bosses and spirit.
[2:14:01] <%Laecerelius> Very nice!
[2:14:01] <%SirKeigan> OCD happy
[2:14:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big int boy

[2:14:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> that pleases the psaGoblin
[2:14:08] <iheartmota> Nioh 1 reuses the same level so many times and the lack of enemy variety doesn't help either

[2:15:14] <+Grayhammatter> sage FRICK
[2:15:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> FeelsBadMan
[2:15:17] <%Caped_Eggy> What a champ LUL
[2:15:18] <londorpaleale> 3-1 is good if you are feeling freke
[2:15:21] <+Joe2187> Farm stones in the spiderfang tunnel to updgrade falchion for busted ass damage
[2:15:22] <Sunstalker> Time to find out if Pat remembers the path
[2:15:26] <Cerabret100> i hate these mindflayer motherfuckers

[2:15:30] <+sixcubit> "Please, help me!"
[2:15:30] <%Caped_Eggy> Where's the singing?
[2:15:35] <chromonaut747> HELP THE SCREAMIN MAN
[2:15:35] <+Mitchellsocks> No matter how many times it's played, 3-1 will be a maze. Hate/love this place
[2:15:37] <CappuccinoGuil> How do you get the items from the hanging corpses?
[2:15:40] <iheartmota> i dont like the bell sfx in the remake
[2:15:40] <%Maruko19> please help me
[2:15:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> i believe that
[2:15:44] <%SirKeigan> yup
[2:15:45] <+jt427> this area is even more spooky now i love it
[2:15:47] <+twohitgood> this is such a weird thing...the jail bars are so ornate.
[2:15:49] <nmaten> and also the mind flayers
[2:15:51] <Parapattern> Gay Baby Jail
[2:15:53] <$ezackazneyes> @Punchasaur u know whats really ironic? not being a fanboy LUL
[2:15:53] <GameOver_Here> I legit screamed when I got to the bottom of this level.
[2:15:53] <jorniev> SCARY AS SHIT
[2:15:54] <%saadi90> Agreed
[2:15:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Mind Flayers
[2:15:54] <ScreamLord> And Mindflayers
[2:15:58] <%SirKeigan> The lightning adds a really nice tough
[2:15:58] <@commanderclaw> This level belongs in a Silent Hill game layout wise
[2:15:59] <%SirKeigan> touch*
[2:16:00] <+Joe2187> manipedes
[2:16:03] <+hax_metatron> They changed the whole atmosphere. No shouting as before, the singing is changed -/ they made it more like Bloodborne :(
[2:16:04] <jorniev> AND THE MINDFLAYERS
[2:16:04] <Cerabret100> @CappuccinoGuil You can manually aim magic at them, probably bow as well
[2:16:07] <Aydarkzero> it gets WEIRD
[2:16:09] <%VivaLetina> oh wow they reused this in 3
[2:16:11] <Srthunda> ya really like the lightning
[2:16:11] <islandsunn> looks a lot like irathyl dungeon in ds3
[2:16:12] <AFlyingTaco1> I would say that the prison from DS3 is scarier, but this layout is definitely a nightmare.
[2:16:12] <%saadi90> Looks very pretty
[2:16:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> S P O O P Y
[2:16:13] <%roscoe_rosaline> SPOOKED
[2:16:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh is this the place with the berserk torture room easter egg
[2:16:16] <%G_Thunders> And then they made a dollar store version of it in DS3 for no reason
[2:16:18] <%mikessdd> they kinda tried to do this again in ds3 but didn't really work
[2:16:18] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:16:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> being a zombie must suck, but being a caged zombie must suck even more
[2:16:19] <Arek_1> I was the opposite. World 1 all the way, world 2 all the way, and so on.
[2:16:20] <%SirKeigan> No more shouting? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:16:21] <londorpaleale> I miss the old singing, it was creepier.
[2:16:25] <+Romuken> OH HI ILLITHID
[2:16:26] <redial_nick> and it's the most berserk of all them
[2:16:31] <+Grayhammatter> spooked by a blue phantom
[2:16:31] <+ChaosAethr> ooooook
[2:16:32] <Parapattern> Don't forget the writhing masses of arms
[2:16:33] <NaturalGear> I think Tomb of Giants is way scarier, but as a level I much prefer Latria
[2:16:34] <+Romuken> Ilithid is looking dope af
[2:16:34] <%roscoe_rosaline> God magic sounds SO GOOD
[2:16:34] <chromonaut747> wheres the shoutin?
[2:16:38] <%Agami23> and the enemies who dont play like any other souls game enemy
[2:16:38] <+DinnerCalzone> that illithid wants you
[2:16:38] <+Mitchellsocks> Irythll dungeon's a pretty mid sendup, yeah
[2:16:41] <Aydarkzero> invaded two worlds?
[2:16:43] <+sermittens> was that a chtulu?
[2:16:46] <Grandma_Amari> I'm not hearing the cage shaking and frustration growling of Lord whats-his-face
[2:16:47] <%T_Sasquatch> Im more scared when theres nothing around me than seeing enemies
[2:16:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @Cerabret100 dope, thanks!
[2:16:53] <+bromeme> This game looks so pretty, it sets my standards too high
[2:16:54] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes ...you don't know what irony means, do ya kid
[2:16:57] <jorniev> why is it agro?
[2:17:02] <happyfacespam> help him rooCry
[2:17:09] <Evil_Pineapple> has pat gotten hugged yet
[2:17:13] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt that is just a chtulu
[2:17:14] <Sunstalker> Where's the HRRRNNNGHHHH? DansGame
[2:17:15] <Grandma_Amari> Oh there he is!
[2:17:17] <%SirKeigan> FOUR HITS
[2:17:18] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt Imagine if these mind flayer could eat you stats too
[2:17:18] <$ezackazneyes> @Punchasaur u dont know what arguing means do ya old man.
[2:17:19] <+SilverDevilfish> I need yur halp
[2:17:19] <+YamadaZero> Was that a Bloodborne enemy?
[2:17:22] <+Grayhammatter> sweet fresh spice
[2:17:22] <%SirKeigan> Remember, four hits
[2:17:26] <londorpaleale> No elp
[2:17:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> does anyone know if the online is better than it used to be?
[2:17:32] <ScreamLord> Zoidberg just wanted a hug
[2:17:33] <%KaiserMario> I hate they changed the name to "Aged Spice", it hould be "Old Spice"
[2:17:36] <+chvmpchange> the yelling is mostly gone
[2:17:37] <+Mitchellsocks> No it's a DnD enemy
[2:17:41] <chromonaut747> booooooooo they made him quieter
[2:17:50] <+EroHoney> a nice prison with a view
[2:17:54] <@SoFarFetched> @Punchasaur @ezackazneyes Are we playing nice here or do I gotta break up you two? geefPoint
[2:17:54] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[2:17:55] <+taren817> Yeah, the remake has a huge amount of detail and shit
[2:17:57] <%dekkitout> tajWHY
[2:17:59] <jorniev> was there more wailing in the original?
[2:17:59] <+taren817> It's awesome
[2:18:02] <Grandma_Amari> I always thought those were webs.
[2:18:02] <%SirKeigan> Old Spice has copyright on that now lol
[2:18:05] <nilla_24> key
[2:18:09] <rjhascancer> key on the wall go back!
[2:18:09] <%SirKeigan> It didn't matter 10 years go I guess
[2:18:11] <+bromeme> The graphic redesign is great, the lighting with the color scheme look so unique for a Souls game
[2:18:12] <Grandma_Amari> Like some weird spooky giant web that covered the sky
[2:18:12] <%RoboticAnimeDude> it would be sick if when elden ring gameplay premieres and it looks even better than this
[2:18:12] <+Joe2187> you missed the keys on the wall
[2:18:15] <Arek_1> @Grandma_Amari With the OG in mind, Lord Rydell is audible deeper in the level.
[2:18:17] <$ezackazneyes> @SoFarFetched just a friendly argument LUL
[2:18:17] <happyfacespam> bone smasher gachiBASS
[2:18:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> is that the song of slumber going on in the background?
[2:18:18] <+chvmpchange> yeah for sure this level was loud
[2:18:19] <%KaiserMario> Good for smashing bones
[2:18:22] <%bevyrage> @KaiserMario OLD SPICE BODY BLOCKER WORKS FOR 18 HOURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSS is probably the reason why they backed down. ye?
[2:18:22] <%Laecerelius> Smash them dragons, boi!
[2:18:23] <%roscoe_rosaline> @SoFarFetched Don't break them up, it's true love ;_;
[2:18:24] <+Mitchellsocks> False Idol's singing really brings the OG together with Upper Cathedral/Gaol vibes
[2:18:24] <jmft2000> key
[2:18:25] <+hax_metatron> I feel like Latria loses something going full Bloodborne @patstaresat
[2:18:25] <%lemuhollow> lemuhollow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months!
[2:18:25] <+Romuken> you should smash a dragon with your bone
[2:18:30] <ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt World tendency is still annoying?
[2:18:33] <%gstut1> this is proto bloodborne
[2:18:33] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:18:36] <godzookylives> @RoboticAnimeDude Kappa
[2:18:37] <%Agami23> whats a parapent?
[2:18:41] <eldercat> The use of color really helps.
[2:18:42] <ToneBacas> Terry Crews will bust your shit if you use Old Spice in this game item description
[2:18:43] <$ezackazneyes> @roscoe_rosaline im done anywas LUL
[2:18:48] <$ezackazneyes> *anyways
[2:18:49] <siriusb614> I dont know why but its actually therapeutic watching ppl play these hard ass games
[2:18:53] <+Mitchellsocks> @ikantreeed It's the same, i think
[2:18:53] <%mikessdd> Elden Ring will never release. GRRM hasn't written a thing for it since being hired I'm sure lol
[2:18:54] <RyuuAoi> Play the game, Pat.
[2:18:57] <%KaiserMario> @bevyrage Ye, but that's why they should've kept it too LUL
[2:18:59] <%Laecerelius> The nerd clothes
[2:19:02] <SovPho> Oh god why has my stream turned into a fuzzball
[2:19:04] <Parapattern> God, I forgot how confusing the keys are for this area
[2:19:06] <%bevyrage> i agree
[2:19:08] <bashful_bard> You died here Pat
[2:19:09] <%SirKeigan> becaue they're not that hard, they're quite peaceful
[2:19:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Is Pat a fake DeS fan?
[2:19:12] <%SirKeigan> the slow pace helps
[2:19:15] <@SoFarFetched> @roscoe_rosaline This love has taken it's toll on me geefChair
[2:19:15] <%arkv01> yer not a wizard, arry
[2:19:16] <%Punchasaur> @ezackazneyes i don't know how to respond to the smoothbrainedness of that comment
[2:19:17] <ikantreeed> elden ring is a myth
[2:19:18] <EuropanLamprey> You're a wizard Dark Souls
[2:19:19] <Aydarkzero> and that's where the Magician died
[2:19:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 8k channel points, almost enough to highlight my message.
[2:19:23] <%G_Thunders> Sadly Elden ring doesn’t have Sony throwing money at it, so it wont look this good. But it’ll still be a great game, probably
[2:19:25] <SovPho> FAKE
[2:19:25] <%kingmemelord97> had to step away what i missed?
[2:19:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Elden Ring is not real
[2:19:30] <@SoFarFetched> @Punchasaur Okay that's enough for now.
[2:19:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> HOW DARE YOU NOT REMEMBER
[2:19:32] <+trav2_> FAKE GAMER
[2:19:32] <+Giantcanaloupe34> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:19:34] <$ezackazneyes> @Punchasaur nice argument there LUL
[2:19:36] <studleydoorite> the first time I played this game I played this level with my tv brightness waay too low
[2:19:38] <EuropanLamprey> So super fake
[2:19:38] <ikantreeed> Pat the fake gamer
[2:19:39] <+some_brave_apollo> fake fan
[2:19:40] <+taren817> Speaking of wizard I was thinking, the next time I ever played a Dark Souls game or something, or even this, playing a spellcaster
[2:19:43] <@SoFarFetched> @ezackazneyes same to you.
[2:19:48] <@SoFarFetched> its time to move on.
[2:19:49] <NaturalGear> you did the playthough with Woolie tho
[2:19:51] <londorpaleale> Open then all, let the tier 3 subs out.
[2:19:56] <%roscoe_rosaline> @SoFarFetched Love can be rough <3
[2:19:59] <+bromeme> Isn't it crazy how advanced Demon's Souls was for its time? It had a multiplayer boss fight
[2:20:00] <%SirKeigan> Why are you summoning? That's cheating LUL
[2:20:01] <@SoFarFetched> none of this "Lemme get the last word in"
[2:20:06] <ikantreeed> crazy talk activated!!!
[2:20:07] <+eanscrale> Everyone's offline cause tendency
[2:20:08] <ToneBacas> play this in Fractured Mode next Kappa
[2:20:08] <Aydarkzero> the remake or original?

[2:20:09] <Srthunda> this area looks great so far
[2:20:14] <$ezackazneyes> @SoFarFetched dude he keeps on insulting me KEKW
[2:20:15] <%mikessdd> Turn that brightness up lol Cheat good
[2:20:17] <Parapattern> Ooh, I like how the summons cast a glow on the environment
[2:20:18] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat isn't a real gamer girl, he's just doing it to sell the fake gamer water
[2:20:18] <Sunstalker> Because it's too cramped to fight off multiple people, honestly
[2:20:19] <AFlyingTaco1> What level are you at @PatStaresAt
[2:20:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Come on invaders!
[2:20:24] <socratetris> Pat, Nobody owns a ps5, you cant get invaded
[2:20:25] <Aydarkzero> well only 5 people own a ps5 Kappa

[2:20:36] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt this is an interesting area to really look at the new filters in your display settings

[2:20:44] <%arkv01> H U G E
[2:20:44] <%SirKeigan> Fractured Mode is so fucked. They said it's the world but it actually changes your character too, so your R1 moves your left hand. It's fucking stupid
[2:20:48] <AFlyingTaco1> I mean that might be the reason why you haven't been invaded
[2:20:50] <spookykrow> level 69
[2:20:52] <%saadi90> 9000

[2:21:09] <urmom467> what kind of build you going for
[2:21:14] <+taren817> That's probably my favorite part about this game. The spells have actual weight and stuff it feels like
[2:21:19] <RyuuAoi> He didn't OP for the COWARDS
[2:21:20] <AFlyingTaco1> @SirKeigan You're fucking kidding me.
[2:21:21] <%SirKeigan> Did that guy get summoned?
[2:21:25] <+YamadaZero> The music here is nice.
[2:21:30] <spookykrow> is the magic arrow build the way to go?
[2:21:30] <%SirKeigan> nope
[2:21:33] <@SoFarFetched> Remember guys we're here to chill and watch a stumbo on screen,you can throw insults at each other in DM's but don't bring that stuff here.
[2:21:33] <+chvmpchange> ngl I miss the ambient wailing sounds
[2:21:34] <%SirKeigan> It's so dumb
[2:21:35] <%kingmemelord97> wtf is that ?!
[2:21:36] <%YakumoYomi> Illithids！

[2:21:59] <spookykrow> I think I grabbed the mace and the heal spell
[2:22:03] <%MelBrooksKA> What do those guys do?
[2:22:06] <+chvmpchange> basically
[2:22:08] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt try fucking around with some of the new filters here to see how everythiing looks
[2:22:09] <%mikessdd> So is this class considered normal or easy mode?

[2:24:28] <icantstopthescreams> Where is the hope in this prison?
[2:24:30] <%bevyrage> huh, the wall keys had a soft glow on them while they were hanging on the wall
[2:24:30] <AFlyingTaco1> @kingmemelord97 Pretty much. They were the area's local royalty until the Old Monk came along and imprisoned all of them.
[2:24:41] <%RoggleJr> That was an almost shit your pants moment.
[2:24:44] <%kingmemelord97> ouch
[2:24:51] <@SoFarFetched> Let's not with the "I forgot who I was insulting" because majority of the time,people know exactly who it is. It just ends up being an indirect jab at the person.
[2:24:53] <%mikessdd> scaredpat has entered
[2:24:57] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt Pat you should let them grab you, the dual sense controller really helps you feel your face get fucked
[2:25:00] <%kingmemelord97> also love the angelic choir
[2:25:01] <bobxmaker> you know, this level is the only part of a souls game that allways feels new to me.
[2:25:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> @taren817 I just noticed that. the Gaol in BB made me lose my shit
[2:25:07] <%MelBrooksKA> @SABiscotti Significantly less fun than normal
[2:25:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> scarediestpat
[2:25:18] <%Caped_Eggy> patscaresat
[2:25:19] <+TaylOctopus91> !uptime
[2:25:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 25m.
[2:25:29] <+taren817> @GalacticaPhanto Plus the Jailers in DS3
[2:25:32] <%roscoe_rosaline> Chat big piss-baby energy today.
[2:25:35] <muetank> Who's worse. The zoidbergs from DES or the Jail wardens from DS3??
[2:25:37] <samuelfisk> The Old Monk’s checking up on ya
[2:25:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> PatScaredAf
[2:25:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> CastleScaryBeast
[2:25:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> OH GOD THE JAILERS
[2:25:48] <Sunstalker> But it's just the same room a few times until you descend LUL
[2:25:48] <%SirKeigan> Jailers
[2:25:55] <%SirKeigan> Definitely the Jailers
[2:25:55] <+taren817> @muetank Jailers
[2:26:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> CastleSuperCreeps
[2:26:03] <Parapattern> Jailers have an AOE
[2:26:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @muetank the Zoidbergs dont shrink your health bar just by existing
[2:26:05] <+ChaosAethr> JAILERS Hands Down
[2:26:05] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> x4slipGongPex x4slipGongPex x4slipGongPex
[2:26:07] <%Agami23> jailers are more annoying than scary
[2:26:08] <happyfacespam> this reminds me of the dungeon from DS3 too much
[2:26:11] <happyfacespam> it's really good
[2:26:19] <%gstut1> pat isnt ready for whats waiting in the bottom
[2:26:20] <%Monkeyweed21> DS3 Jailers are the WORST
[2:26:26] <%SirKeigan> It appears you have a lifebar. Can I interest you in NOT having a lifebar? LUL
[2:26:26] <%mikessdd> jailers elicit more anxiety
[2:26:28] <Arek_1> Nah, 3-2 is terrifying. NotLikeThis
[2:26:32] <V0idWaIker> Ds3 dungeon was inspired by this @happyfacespam
[2:26:34] <%WhereIsWill> jailers remove health on sight thats some bs
[2:26:38] <AFlyingTaco1> Pretty sure the dungeon from DS3 was based on this area
[2:26:39] <Sol_Install> Are you?
[2:26:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh my
[2:26:44] <happyfacespam> you're not ready for John Souls rooSmug
[2:26:49] <%RoboticAnimeDude> jailers for sure, these guys in latria are my bros in comparison lol
[2:26:54] <Sunstalker> The prequel to SKELETONBALL, CORPSEBALL PogChamp
[2:26:57] <bobxmaker> you guys haven't got one-shot by the mindflayers?
[2:26:59] <Aydarkzero> he just wanted to do the HandsUp emote Pat
[2:27:00] <DirtyMerlin> Slice em up Patrick yaa
[2:27:02] <+EroHoney> Pat smelled that man's chest and then killed him. rude
[2:27:05] <%blue8moon> DS3 jailers are "How can we make mindflayers more annoying?"
[2:27:06] <%Punchasaur> jailers are worse. the environment you fight them in is darker and more restrictive
[2:27:08] <+taren817> This doesn't even look like a tower
[2:27:08] <+Joe2187> Legion
[2:27:13] <NaturalGear> Jailers are more annoying but Mindflayers a more dangerous, that's why you never encounter them in groups
[2:27:17] <chromonaut747> man must suck for these dudes stuck in this jail only to be killed by some dood passing by
[2:27:22] <happyfacespam> monkaS
[2:27:27] <%Faustgesicht> Is there lore regarding this place?
[2:27:31] <DirtyMerlin> shoot the blue at em real good
[2:27:33] <%kingmemelord97> AHHH
[2:27:35] <happyfacespam> uh...eek monkaS
[2:27:40] <BaronVonProlix> reminds me of the RE2R locker guy
[2:27:41] <%linSP> oh noo
[2:27:43] <Sunstalker> Not that one LUL
[2:27:43] <%Keaton_x> aaaah
[2:27:48] <%kingmemelord97> 2spooky4me
[2:27:49] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Is this the only other area next to the Gaol in Bloodborne to have music?
[2:27:57] <+HeroSolaire> wasnt there a scream?
[2:27:59] <+CannonHeroBrett> @PatStaresAt you talk to mans in the cell already?
[2:28:01] <%mikessdd> dude let us out
[2:28:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:28:08] <%linSP> those guys dont agro
[2:28:10] <AFlyingTaco1> @Faustgesicht Big tower run by royalty, who all got fucked over by a guy called the Old Monk when he showed up and imprisoned them
[2:28:17] <+sixcubit> won't you Please Help Him
[2:28:19] <+hax_metatron> @trollking96 DS1 Ash Lake, DS2 Shrune of Amana
[2:28:20] <%Punchasaur> the screaming corpse in ds3 is the best jumpscare in the series
[2:28:34] <%kingmemelord97> this would make a great horror map
[2:28:35] <+HeroSolaire> The dude screaming in tower of latria is gone?
[2:28:38] <+CannonHeroBrett> SHIV
[2:28:46] <+HeroSolaire> or does he still scream chat?
[2:28:47] <Zalpar> I really don't know barely anything about Demon's Souls, so that jump-scare was an interesting time to hop in
[2:28:49] <%juxtest> Come to think of it I didn't hear that dude screaming every 12 freaking seconds
[2:28:52] <happyfacespam> 'fine' is an awfully flexible word in the Souls universe
[2:29:01] <mothdude> Snarf down that grass
[2:29:06] <%mikessdd> for fists they get some good hits in
[2:29:07] <Aydarkzero> @HeroSolaire he'll say help me and that's about it

[2:29:24] <iheartmota> its not the fools idol
[2:29:26] <londorpaleale> wrong
[2:29:26] <SovPho> Fool's Idol is a good band name
[2:29:27] <+falineth> not the merchant?
[2:29:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> fool's idol is a strong name
[2:29:30] <Parapattern> The screaming guy could get pretty grating
[2:29:32] <%KaiserMario> psaBig psaWrong
[2:29:33] <+SuicidalLemmming> no its not
[2:29:33] <iheartmota> its the noblewoman merchant

[2:29:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Semon of Dong
[2:29:41] <Tupperwarez> why do the life bars look so cheap?
[2:29:42] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt Its the queen
[2:29:46] <mr_red117> or noblewoman
[2:29:46] <%Punchasaur> singing is music
[2:29:49] <%kingmemelord97> iron maidens are werid
[2:29:50] <%Agami23> you can count it as much as shrine of amana
[2:29:51] <+hax_metatron> NOOO it’s the merchant singing LUL
[2:29:53] <%Vyskus> HRRRRRRRRNGH HELP ME
[2:29:53] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Singing is music still
[2:30:08] <studleydoorite> how can they be wizard clothes without two foot wide sleeves
[2:30:09] <Huskylluvr> the only real music is when grog smack two rock together
[2:30:09] <Zalpar> kingmemelord97 they weren't actually real
[2:30:14] <%promessav2> that just makes it diagetic
[2:30:17] <+StrifeZubia> How are none of these iron maidens mimics
[2:30:18] <Arek_1> The Once Royal Mistress.
[2:30:20] <Tupperwarez> you'd think they'd make them look a little nicer after all the art changes
[2:30:32] <watts121> This a Crescent Falchion easy mode run?

[2:31:08] <studleydoorite> that guy lived for that moment, he died laughing
[2:31:09] <%KaiserMario> This is the Demon's Souls Mimic
[2:31:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> How'd that guy survive an Iron Maiden?
[2:31:15] <%Punchasaur> what an epic prank
[2:31:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> ! NTR'd !
[2:31:29] <Aydarkzero> monkaS

[2:31:54] <%Jack8274> I wanna invade you pat, can i pls
[2:31:54] <Parapattern> That spot has killed me more times than I can remember
[2:32:03] <Zalpar> kingmemelord97 I forget the dates, but like a couple hundred years ago people got really into learning about torture devices of the even older times. Some things were designed wrong from descriptions, I think some were just made up to look scary
[2:32:03] <%MelBrooksKA> Backtrack 2: the back back track
[2:32:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That hobo was a badass for hiding in a fucking IRON MAIDEN
[2:32:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> Vic Van Lier deserves to be in this prison
[2:32:19] <%Jack8274> @HeroSolaire Need help?
[2:32:24] <%Jack8274> I'm online
[2:32:26] <+taren817> @MyNameIsRasus Along with Eric Sparrow

[2:32:38] <%gstut1> let em learn
[2:32:40] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[2:32:41] <%Punchasaur> FOF
[2:32:42] <%Jack8274> Or just get good pat, legit just roll
[2:32:44] <Zalpar> kingmemelord97 Iron Maidens are weird because they're in like torture chambers and stuff, but they'd just be a kinda annoying way to kill someone, really. Big heavy standing metal casket full of stabbing
[2:32:48] <+HeroSolaire> @Jack8274 im quoting rydell :)
[2:32:48] <Arek_1> @Jack8274 Don't ask for permission. Ask for forgiveness. LUL
[2:32:53] <AFlyingTaco1> Always lame it out against the mindflayers
[2:32:54] <%mikessdd> either fuck em up or run eh?
[2:32:56] <mothdude> Fight them but cheat to do it
[2:32:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> funny how this is the second game Pat
[2:32:59] <Sunstalker> Not with the Halberd psaWhat
[2:32:59] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> But what if win?
[2:33:04] <bobxmaker> finally someone speaking the truth, people think the flayers are a joke, but when they getcha, they getcha
[2:33:05] <Grandma_Amari> Those black phantom versions are fucking nightmares
[2:33:06] <watts121> I really hope PC gets PS5 controller support since it seems like the best controller in the world right now.
[2:33:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> has played this year featuring mindflayers
[2:33:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "We're saved! We're dead!"
[2:33:15] <%kingmemelord97> @Zalpar so the iron maidens of today may not be the real design .
[2:33:16] <%chiazam> I totally won tho
[2:33:17] <SovPho> @Zalpar wouldn't they just die when they were put on the spikes originally, like... before closing?
[2:33:24] <DXLelouch24> Pat i fought em and was fine, maybe you just suck
[2:33:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> like my penis ayyyy
[2:33:27] <%Jack8274> What level is pat?
[2:33:31] <AFlyingTaco1> Not really
[2:33:33] <Parapattern> Claws!
[2:33:36] <+taren817> I think you missed a thing
[2:33:37] <Huskylluvr> whenever I see an iron maiden I just think of that one magician trick with the swords
[2:33:38] <%Monkeyweed21> blind
[2:33:39] <londorpaleale> @Jack8274 18
[2:33:41] <%dekkitout> Can you hit them with a big dose of truth?
[2:33:47] <%Puhff> blind
[2:33:49] <AFlyingTaco1> I'm going with a strength build and using a claymore in this area is a nightmare
[2:33:51] <+Grayhammatter> stron blue
[2:33:51] <Grandma_Amari> lul
[2:33:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Playstation Network
[2:33:57] <+taren817> I think the problem is you're not staying close to the sign
[2:33:59] <iheartmota> 20 other people might have invited him
[2:34:00] <%Piemono> Maybe you're just not popular
[2:34:01] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Dabbadeedabbadye
[2:34:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> because your game smells
[2:34:07] <SovPho> cowards can't join warriors
[2:34:10] <Zalpar> kingmemelord97 you might be write, iron maidens were designed off of a description, but I cound't understand the descriptions I saw
[2:34:10] <icantstopthescreams> It's actually pretty messed up the prisoners cower at the sight of you
[2:34:10] <%Monkeyweed21> The game detected you are a bitch coward and marked you as a cheater @PatStaresAt
[2:34:12] <%Xelhesia> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[2:34:12] <%moogleboy1984> Off screen grinding till SL300 will do that
[2:34:13] <%dekkitout> Maybe they think you smelly
[2:34:15] <Grandma_Amari> Because they know you're a stinky streamer
[2:34:17] <%mikessdd> they were on wifi
[2:34:17] <Sunstalker> SovPho Iron Maiden's weren't ever really a thing? But if they were, the bleeding would have been reducedsince the spikes stayed in
[2:34:25] <londorpaleale> Maybe it has to do with moving to different areas, I remember that being finicky.
[2:34:28] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[2:34:30] <chromonaut747> he musta killed oscar for it
[2:34:31] <bobxmaker> oh he killed ostrava?

[2:35:33] <Zalpar> SovPho I'm not really an expert, it just.. I think you'd get stabbed a lot as it closed and honestly it just seems very expensive and heavy instead of the executioner's axe
[2:35:36] <Grandma_Amari> It made it feel really ominous that it was shrouded in that PS3 fog
[2:35:40] <%Caped_Eggy> No singing?

[2:50:41] <Zalpar> "Spirit, tell me your tale of woe." -"Falling sucks."

[2:50:48] <$ezackazneyes> bloodborne was way better imho.
[2:50:56] <bashful_bard> Yeah it's a banger
[2:50:56] <%G_Thunders> Pretty much
[2:50:58] <Slimeking_Mike> Yea 3-2 is super cool
[2:50:59] <ammobasket> “Oh check it out, they saved my old bloodstain from way back!”
[2:51:02] <londorpaleale> the water in 3-2 could have used some poison
[2:51:02] <Grandma_Amari> It's not bad at all
[2:51:03] <+zeraux_> SOULSIAN?

[2:52:02] <thebehatted> miyazaki described bloodborne as an entire game based on tower of latria in a pre release interview

[2:52:30] <%Valdorick> Estoc Bestoc
[2:52:33] <%dekkitout> @akitanito Yep- guide him into a shallow grave SeriousSloth
[2:52:37] <$ezackazneyes> i really liked the aesthetic of bloodborne.
[2:52:37] <Zalpar> I thought I misunderstood the one Visage chapter I saw Pat stream, cause it was too depressing, so I looked it up, and unfortunately I did not
[2:52:39] <Enthaarungscreme> rare footage of pat actually running
[2:52:40] <%SirKeigan> Starting damage on the Rapier is 75, Estoc is 80. Simple maths
[2:52:43] <NitronStreams> the rapier she tells you not to worry about
[2:52:51] <+KENTASHIRO> Pat do the chad gamer move and roll through it
[2:52:52] <londorpaleale> T

Hey Pat, just finished the podcast, totally agree with the points made on digital purchases, would like to add that it helps in theft cases. Had my Switch stolen and boy am I glad most of my collection isn't just flat up gone. Enjoy the Souls of Demon!
[2:52:59] <%mikessdd> wow fuck that

[2:53:21] <+taren817> Why the fuck did they build this anyway? What were they expecting to stop?
[2:53:21] <Make_me_mad> That giant ballista lady statue is, in my opinion, the coolest thing in the entire Tower of Latria. The design of that is so strong.
[2:53:22] <MangoPirate> I'm surprised at how much I remember of this game
[2:53:22] <%kingmemelord97> yoooo wtf is this lord of the rules bullshit
[2:53:25] <chromonaut747> never mind im stoopid

[2:53:58] <%dekkitout> A traversable ledge in a souls game? Blasphemy

[2:55:24] <Sunstalker> Pat, try rolling through it. Nothing to lose.
[2:55:25] <%SirKeigan> Where go now?
[2:55:26] <MangoPirate> I fell a stupid number of times here in the original
[2:55:29] <@SoFarFetched> Paige would need to hear so she can see.
[2:55:30] <%gstut1> imagine your first time here in fluted armor and you had to fat roll though the arrows
[2:55:40] <taquito_blade> oh those fuckn cthuloids
[2:55:42] <+zeraux_> are the va rerecorded?
[2:55:43] <%T_Sasquatch> No torches in this game ?
[2:55:45] <+chvmpchange> Latria and Shrine of storms are my favorite zones in the series
[2:55:59] <Zalpar> did that spirit have a tornado for a head?
[2:56:00] <+chvmpchange> nope
[2:56:03] <+DinnerCalzone> this level is so confusing
[2:56:07] <%NovaKnightmare> Mindflayers
[2:56:08] <%Punchasaur> demons souls has that dark renaissance aesthetic fucking nailed
[2:56:08] <%gstut1> i love it
[2:56:13] <%Laecerelius> Cachoochoos
[2:56:18] <Make_me_mad> Tower of Latria zone 2 is one of my favorite areas because it's the most metal thing in the souls series.
[2:56:24] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Cthulads
[2:56:29] <+KENTASHIRO> god damn these choo choos
[2:56:29] <%dekkitout> A straight up mindflayer

[2:56:31] <thebehatted> theycant.
[2:56:32] <taquito_blade> most stressful enemy in the game
[2:56:36] <+StrifeZubia> Motherfucker said avada kadavera
[2:56:48] <+ChaosAethr> Someone correct me if Im wrong but you could roll through to that Statue?
[2:56:51] <%mikessdd> wish ENB wasn't out of the game. Would love to know what he thinks about this game
[2:56:59] <thebehatted> they cant call them mindflayers cuz dnd actually copyrighted that name
[2:57:01] <seaechiowai> Squid4 Squid3
[2:57:02] <+chvmpchange> Lemme suck out them brains
[2:57:07] <iheartmota> he streams
[2:57:14] <Gallhint> yes
[2:57:14] <%Chimeraelite> No ps5
[2:57:16] <+trav2_> he's fine
[2:57:17] <%SirKeigan> ENB doesn't care because he doesn't care about consoles anymore
[2:57:18] <%Ynkubus_> He just streams now
[2:57:20] <Zayasu> no he just doesnt have a ps5
[2:57:20] <GameOver_Here> He's been playing DS1

[2:57:35] <Cerabret100> I just got lucky
[2:57:35] <%SirKeigan> He's a PC only guy now
[2:57:36] <%gstut1> PS5 Bros!!!
[2:57:36] <SugarOG_> what weapon are you using @PatStaresAt ?
[2:57:41] <%SirKeigan> No interest in getting a PS5
[2:57:41] <Cerabret100> i didn't bust shit
[2:57:42] <tattleworm> enb gave up a couple hours into 13 sentinels because it was too anime
[2:57:45] <%linSP> yeah, pat actually spoke to a human to get his ps5
[2:57:45] <%wruce__billis> checking fifty digital storefrotns isn't busting your ass
[2:57:47] <%NovaKnightmare> hot take: Covid sucks
[2:57:47] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Your ass was always busted
[2:57:49] <%Punchasaur> gib ps5

[2:57:55] <churropoppa> Was it work buying a PS5
[2:57:57] <churropoppa> ?
[2:58:02] <%Monkeyweed21> you can afford to pay for multiple PS5s pat
[2:58:03] <+chvmpchange> crescent falchion
[2:58:06] <thebehatted> if I recall he usually doesnt like getting early copies
[2:58:07] <iheartmota> enb is very fickle with his taste
[2:58:15] <+Dustwalker44> Hows the controller feed back on box hits?
[2:58:18] <+bokchoy__> hows that controller
[2:58:20] <jkfd> enb is fine. he just *really hates* time travel/mecha/etc plots
[2:58:27] <dogmadog> invisibility activated
[2:58:28] <taquito_blade> wait is that guy screaming in the locked cell still there?
[2:58:29] <AFlyingTaco1> @churropoppa For many people, it is a struggle because of garbage scalper bots
[2:58:33] <%SirKeigan> You guys. I asked him why he wasn't streaming this game and he said he has no interest in consoles anymore
[2:58:42] <%Puhff> Yeah all ENB does is play Secret of Mana these days
[2:58:42] <fuji_92> nah, I feel like he has his tastes very figured out
[2:58:43] <AFlyingTaco1> The controller feels incredible on feedback
[2:58:48] <+DinnerCalzone> i love that spider web of chains
[2:58:50] <axegang> hello pat and friends!
[2:58:57] <+jjjkopf> anyone else annoyed by the constant panting from the guy?
[2:58:58] <+Draegen86> IS THAT ANOR LONDO?
[2:59:02] <%T_Sasquatch> LUL ok and ? Console only games exist LUL
[2:59:03] <Zalpar> jkfd I can understanding hating time travel plots. Almost every series breaks it's own rules and just makes stupid nonsense
[2:59:06] <bashful_bard> Nice to see that Latria is still the best
[2:59:09] <tacoisgoods> is this a bloodborne?
[2:59:13] <+zeraux_> THEY REALLY SHOULD UPGRADE AND RERELEASE BLOOD BOURNE
[2:59:14] <%Fooguwu> ENB just likes nostalgia and old games
[2:59:15] <thebehatted> that moon is new!
[2:59:16] <londorpaleale> @T_Sasquatch clearly
[2:59:19] <Zalpar> jkfd at least Back to the Future is fun
[2:59:31] <+zeraux_> also i think elden ring is gonna suck
[2:59:32] <%dekkitout> Because big gothic energies
[2:59:35] <@commanderclaw> But then oops, all cthulhu
[2:59:39] <fuji_92> he will stream whenever he gets a ps5 but he isn't rushing to get one, that's all, it really isn't hard to get
[2:59:39] <%gstut1> LAtria is sick in the remake
[2:59:40] <+jjjkopf> is this Lords of the Fallen 2
[2:59:41] <%wruce__billis> it hink you mean bb is latria
[2:59:42] <%Agami23> theres enough in bloodborne to make the arguement. like great old ones and shit

[3:09:11] <Sain_127> the combat looks clunky

[3:12:21] <Aydarkzero> actual simp

[3:12:26] <Zalpar> and respawning the boss is.......bad?
[3:12:34] <%penitentpendant> Gaping Maw, that's what it was called
[3:12:39] <%kingmemelord97> wait a npc strong enough to rez a boss thats pretty cool
[3:12:40] <+Jaysky> One could say he is the fool and she is his idol
[3:12:42] <Arek_1> The proto-simp. LUL
[3:12:43] <%Jack8274> @Zalpar You can't progress
[3:12:44] <%gstut1> FYI Pat you can sent items in your inventory to storage
[3:12:46] <%aishman> @Zalpar Not respawn, meaning the fight doesn't end
[3:12:47] <+twohitgood> it'd be hilarious if there were a pressure plate that re-activated the machine.
[3:12:48] <%T_Sasquatch> I would actually explode if that happened to me
[3:12:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Zalpar The fight doesn't end.
[3:12:51] <Sunstalker> Pat, explore past the side door in the right tower back there
[3:12:57] <%mikessdd> yes it doesn't die if it forever stays alive
[3:12:57] <%Caped_Eggy> @Zalpar if you want to progress, yes
[3:12:59] <%twoto858> I guess the boss really is the Fool's Idol
[3:13:09] <Zalpar> Ooohhhh, okay, okay.
[3:13:10] <%gstut1> Sage Frick
[3:13:12] <huskarl_zap> this game has way more dnd influence in it than dark souls with dungeon layout and traps
[3:13:12] <%Monkeyweed21> All Religion is simping really
[3:13:14] <2deep5u> imagine being so into the fool's idol that you resurrect her infinite times even though you know she's a fake

[3:14:02] <Zalpar> Punchasaur isn't that every idol? Industry's almost built on it
[3:14:02] <%bevyrage> @PatStaresAt so that chime you've heard a couple of times is produced by the mind flayers you've been killing. if one of them is in the area when you run in there's a chance you'll hear it to let you know they're there.
[3:14:10] <thebehatted> @monkeyweed21 that's a strong podcast title

[3:17:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> one thing i'll give ds3 props on is that treating the ambered form as a bonus instead of treating the lack of it as a punishment was way softer on the psaGoblin

[3:26:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> might require 50 luck points to unlock the secret door
[3:26:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[3:26:31] <Sunstalker> Or you go Faith build and just passive regen health like a chad
[3:26:31] <LunacyRosier> item drops dont kill bosses

[3:32:32] <+sinistersally> Did pat just call her the C word?
[3:32:39] <star_feline> should've left a message saying, "bye loser"
[3:32:41] <Noogiez> dont invade unless you ready for the PAIN TRAIN
[3:32:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt I'm shocked you don't have a scraping spear to *really* give folks you invade the proper DeS experience.
[3:32:48] <@SoFarFetched> DansGame someone trying to do spoilers in here
[3:32:48] <kammerdood> the menus are ugly and bland
[3:32:50] <+zeraux_> THE BLOODBOURNE ENDING
[3:32:50] <%dekkitout> Compared to what Paige would have done, that was a mercy form Pat
[3:32:52] <%spitelite> i bet they though start pauses the game

[3:33:14] <$ezackazneyes> if pat goes for the bad ending, u have no say in it chat Kappa
[3:33:15] <%G_Thunders> Bad ending gives you better end-credits music
[3:33:20] <+Gecko_Dundee> Gecko_Dundee subscribed with Prime.
[3:33:21] <+KENTASHIRO> who cares about build when you're using the scraping spear?
[3:33:25] <%Order_of_Mystery> always nice to have on you just in case >:3c
[3:33:26] <AGood_Noodle> What is the benefit from having a human body vs just being a ghost in this game?
[3:33:31] <+CrunchyFrog_> nobody uses scraping spear for the damage
[3:33:36] <Brigins> this is some spooky stuff here
[3:33:36] <+shapeforn> I love all the new animations besides the halberd ones
[3:33:36] <+sinistersally> @T_Sasquatch I 'eard what i 'eard
[3:33:37] <$Dakuu75> is there a sneaky-sneak type ring, like the won is DS3?
[3:33:54] <%Puhff> BLIND
[3:33:55] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh @PatStaresAt take the cling ring off!
[3:33:56] <Sunstalker> AGood_Noodle full HP versus half HP
[3:33:56] <%Piemono> @AGood_Noodle basically the same as hollowed vs not hollowed
[3:34:09] <icantstopthescreams> @AGood_Noodle More health plus access too online functions
[3:34:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh thought he still had it on whoops
[3:34:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> For me that was DS2 because effigies were so plentiful
[3:34:30] <AGood_Noodle> Thanks!
[3:34:35] <+tigerfang86> Pat doing the big evil
[3:34:41] <+tigerfang86> is it Based @PatStaresAt
[3:34:45] <SovPho> why would you say it like that
[3:34:46] <+Pyroclase> Maybe you can do an invasion stream sometime
[3:34:50] <LunacyRosier> estoc invader NotLikeThis
[3:34:53] <+SinisterBroccoli> yeah I had the most fun invading in Demon's souls as well, my first souls game so it left an impression
[3:34:54] <%saadi90> Fam
[3:34:55] <Sunstalker> Pat's being based again, like the kids say
[3:34:55] <TheFilth> I hope this games online play in Aus isn't as crusty as other souls games
[3:35:01] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I had to leave for two hours what did I miss?
[3:35:01] <redrins> it can also be toxic as shit which is great honestly
[3:35:02] <fuji_92> based on what Kappa

[3:35:04] <+CrunchyFrog_> @PatStaresAt can you do the infinite headbutt
[3:35:08] <spinningchurro> Did that guy ever sub to pat after confirming the horrible nature of Bugsnax?
[3:35:09] <%Agami23> pat, did you ever use the boss invade glitch in darksouls 3 before it got patched out?
[3:35:15] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I just learned about the Soul Sucker spell and that is a fucking evil spell designed to piss people off LUL
[3:35:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> How would you rate invading in DeS from cringe to based
[3:35:27] <+Mr_Morbid> atpRtsd
[3:35:28] <+JFKRobot> @PatStaresAt how does this compare to your original playthough?
[3:35:33] <%wruce__billis> invading is always based
[3:35:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> @CrunchyFrog_ infinite headbutt is still 100% a thing.
[3:35:37] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Killed my first invader in the remake tonight.

[3:37:38] <%fritz_dacat> clempsPog Nice Worse girl has shown up
[3:37:39] <%aishman> Oh I didn't play NG+ DS3.

[3:37:40] <%T_Sasquatch> Ooooh elden ring
[3:37:43] <%Puhff> bitch got 4 arms
[3:37:47] <collind99> Is the character creation good enough to where I can create a pretty anime boy
[3:37:49] <%Solid_Stro> There’s a trophy for only attacking the real False Idol, none of the clones
[3:37:51] <%Laecerelius> Beat her ass!
[3:37:57] <NaturalGear> I wish my church had anime girls on stained glass
[3:37:58] <%gstut1> let her have it
[3:37:58] <mdkcde> SHe HOT
[3:38:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> PINWHEEL!
[3:38:02] <%Punchasaur> smellden ring
[3:38:05] <%arcielardor> baby's nail!!
[3:38:07] <DSD24> I'm not hearing the music
[3:38:08] <+SinisterBroccoli> there's an achievement for not hurting any clones
[3:38:09] <SovPho> didn't one shot, not pontif
[3:38:10] <DSD24> Oh there it is
[3:38:11] <jorniev> is the song better?
[3:38:11] <+twohitgood> so...there's a trick to this.
[3:38:13] <%bevyrage> pat you have to remember the SIGILS
[3:38:21] <%AlphaTauri> where lorian
[3:38:21] <Sunstalker> the magic they cast
[3:38:22] <+SinisterBroccoli> there spells are different
[3:38:22] <%blue8moon> the spell they cast
[3:38:24] <%bevyrage> clones can't cast the big spells iirc
[3:38:25] <Onamar> The zombies follow the real one
[3:38:25] <HalloweenHangover> Attack is a different color
[3:38:26] <%RoggleJr> What spell she casts.
[3:38:27] <UlriktheSlayer1> pontif and the crustal mage ugh
[3:38:27] <fuji_92> proto pinwheel Kappa
[3:38:27] <DSD24> The spell they cast
[3:38:27] <kammerdood> you killed the guys that pray to her dumbass
[3:38:28] <huskarl_zap> bigger magic missle
[3:38:28] <+twohitgood> health bars when targeting the fakes
[3:38:28] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Real ones magic attack is larger
[3:38:29] <+TheBitingIrish> Real one casts a bigger spell
[3:38:30] <chromonaut747> sigil on bottom= clone
[3:38:34] <%Maids4lyfe> the clones have HP bars @PatStaresAt
[3:38:34] <%T_Sasquatch> Crystal sage i think
[3:38:35] <%spitelite> big magic
[3:38:37] <xSHARKPUNCHx> clones have health bars over them when locked on
[3:38:37] <+Ultimate_Edge> Locking on a clone shows generic healthbar. Real one doesn't.
[3:38:38] <justinjones1989> color of the magic
[3:38:39] <DeathByPoke7> little spell is the clone
[3:38:40] <%saadi90> Color of soul arrow
[3:38:40] <%T_Sasquatch> Color
[3:38:41] <+shapeforn> Its so interesting that From has basically remade the same game 4 times, and I will play every single one without complaint
[3:38:43] <2deep5u> whichever is the hardest to reach
[3:38:43] <+Mitchellsocks> They have an identifieable healthbar
[3:38:45] <dreamchaserhg> Clones have a health bar
[3:38:47] <%Solid_Stro> The clone’s spells are smaller
[3:38:49] <+twohitgood> fakes show a healthbar overhead
[3:38:50] <ravioli_ronin> Kinda reminds me of pinwheel
[3:38:54] <+titansloth93> Calling the waifu-bait the "Fool's Idol" feels on the nose
[3:38:59] <LunacyRosier> I remember jerma raging at this boss
[3:39:08] <+twohitgood> no, the boss doesn't have a healthbar.
[3:39:20] <+TheBitingIrish> SIZE, pat
[3:39:21] <%slimmixrp> Light blue
[3:39:23] <Zombrocom> The boss doesnt have a bar
[3:39:24] <$Dakuu75> Kill um all, Peter~
[3:39:25] <%Maids4lyfe> SHE'S IN THE BACK
[3:39:26] <+SinisterBroccoli> in the original hers was greenish
[3:39:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> fakes have healthbars
[3:39:28] <+CannonHeroBrett> boss has no small health bar lol
[3:39:32] <%gstut1> bitch laugh'
[3:39:34] <+TopTieramisu> shocking

[3:39:42] <%Maids4lyfe> boss does not have small HP bar
[3:39:44] <+deviljhojho_> man this fight is a shitshow
[3:39:44] <%T_Sasquatch> Light blue is real
[3:39:45] <+sinistersally> also, if they have a full health bar its a clone
[3:39:46] <+TheBitingIrish> Spell SIZE
[3:39:49] <$ezackazneyes> try cheesing, pat....

[3:46:36] <%wruce__billis> aside form losing viewers you mean
[3:46:40] <%VvTacoSaladvV> FromSoft should make another horror game. They good at atmosphere.
[3:46:47] <%logoth_> Do you lose world tendency if you invade and kill someone?
[3:46:48] <LunacyRosier> wow the host is not hiding?
[3:46:52] <Bloodninja15> Bobby said "Call an ambulance, but not for me."
[3:46:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> more like doubling viewers
[3:46:52] <tetriata> I mean, it lowers your character tendancy and makes the game harder
[3:46:53] <TheFilth> Dakid no! D:
[3:46:54] <+chvmpchange> being a launch title is fantastic for this game's servers I bet

[3:48:14] <AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt Are you using the Thief's Ring to lame it out super hard?
[3:48:16] <TheFilth> nobody teleported behind the other, this isn't the true souls experience

[3:48:42] <tetriata> @blackbookalpha Invading lowers character tendency, not world tendency

[3:48:50] <huskarl_zap> the PAT EVIL
[3:48:51] <+twohitgood> keep it up and you'll be able to get some mephistopheles missions.
[3:48:56] <+Quack_of_Dawn> What does it MEAN, though?
[3:48:56] <Parapattern> Every Villain Is Lemons
[3:49:02] <%debugdrawray_> get the northern regalia
[3:49:03] <+gutlesscoward> uh oh bad world
[3:49:09] <%debugdrawray_> become pure black
[3:49:10] <collind99> What does character tendency affect?
[3:49:12] <lovelycthulhu> Do invaders not lose a soul level when killed?
[3:49:14] <+SinisterBroccoli> does character tendency affect anything again or is it just world?
[3:49:15] <+CrunchyFrog_> F for white world tendency
[3:49:21] <$ezackazneyes> chat TriHard
[3:49:28] <mr_slaide> Yes, but how does King Crimson works?
[3:49:32] <RedHotBoss> crescent falchion coward build?
[3:49:33] <Oxybe> Pattron's Dark Adventure: Dork Tendencies?
[3:49:34] <R0DA> grungy fantasy that isn't overly edgy is so good
[3:49:40] <Vermillion129> @collind99 health and damage during coop/pvp
[3:49:41] <happyfacespam> white tendency is for wimps
[3:49:44] <+andiwaffles> character tendency unlocks Mephistopheles
[3:49:46] <%dekkitout> Black Tendency? Is that a new arc?
[3:49:49] <happyfacespam> embrace the darkness rooH
[3:49:50] <+chvmpchange> every pat build is a coward build
[3:49:53] <+MoonObscure> ooof...
[3:49:54] <+NormalGuy> that soul gathering animation is nice
[3:49:56] <+Grayhammatter> get good
[3:49:57] <%Agami23> i wonder if they kept that shitty spell that can drain levels
[3:49:57] <%wruce__billis> they fucked up the castle world a bit by making the lighting better. the sterile bright white light fit the theme of the game
[3:49:58] <iheartmota> in ps3 the load times were a minute long
[3:50:00] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> black tendency more fun
[3:50:00] <%T_Sasquatch> @sinisterbroccoli black means harder and better loot
[3:50:03] <RedHotBoss> hmmm tru
[3:50:06] <ScreamLord> No short cuts?
[3:50:06] <Bloodninja15> No checkpoints baybee
[3:50:07] <%ZephynM> Isn't it like this with all the FromSoftware games or did they go easier on you in later titles?
[3:50:10] <DXLelouch24> thats the real boss in Demon Souls
[3:50:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> i actually prefer this to ds3's abundance of bonfires
[3:50:12] <DXLelouch24> Walking
[3:50:13] <ravioli_ronin> BLACK TENDENCY ✊🏿
[3:50:16] <+gutlesscoward> I just beat the boss first try so I never had to do this
[3:50:17] <+SinisterBroccoli> T_Sasquatch right right makes sense thank you
[3:50:19] <bashful_bard> The upside is she's just pinwheel
[3:50:21] <%T_Sasquatch> I'd just save scum
[3:50:24] <+Grayhammatter> no checkpoints
[3:50:28] <gooner4654> I'm playing dark souls on the switch at nearly 4am in the uk
[3:50:30] <TheFilth> I really love the magic effect
[3:50:32] <%wruce__billis> @ZephynM all the later titles are far easier than DeS imo
[3:50:33] <+max_radical> does this run at 30 or 60?
[3:50:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> shortcuts being q better solution than both of these
[3:50:38] <%juxtest> Pat has eaten the forbidden black tendie
[3:50:38] <+chvmpchange> Lmao no manual saves
[3:50:49] <%T_Sasquatch> Save scum with ssd PogChamp
[3:50:58] <%wruce__billis> the mines
[3:50:59] <+twohitgood> stonefang
[3:51:03] <ScreamLord> Stonefang
[3:51:05] <%ZephynM> @wruce__billis Ah, okay. Thanks.
[3:51:09] <AFlyingTaco1> @ZephynM Depends on the boss and which game you're playing. Most were made considerably easier, but some areas were still fairly rough.
[3:51:13] <Bloodninja15> Cloud lets u save scum
[3:51:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> anime mural
[3:51:19] <+MoonObscure> Kreygasm
[3:51:23] <sparkavery> pat how do you like the ps5?
[3:51:24] <%T_Sasquatch> @chvmpchange no just quit out the game and upload the save
[3:51:25] <%ZephynM> Sekiro took me about 7 hours to kill Juzou the Drunkard but once I got him, the rest got easier to handle.
[3:51:27] <+It_sjustjoey> Huh. Weird.
[3:51:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> I wish Bloodborne had that
[3:51:37] <%ZephynM> Though each boss was harder than the last, they didn't take as long
[3:51:43] <+Grayhammatter> ass souls
[3:51:44] <UlriktheSlayer1> that's pretty neat each world has specific materials/supplies i didn't know that
[3:51:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> I have finished the NC Reaper Salsa
[3:51:47] <Sunstalker> See, pat? No small healthbar above her
[3:51:48] <+chvmpchange> Oh jeez okay lol I didn't know that was a thing
[3:51:52] <+CannonHeroBrett> pat its that one
[3:51:52] <ScreamLord> I wonder what the broken archstone's consumable will be if we get it as DLC?
[3:51:54] <nmaten> the real demons souls starts here
[3:51:56] <+zeraux_> is she hot?
[3:52:02] <Sigma_190_Beta> No small health bar!
[3:52:02] <+tigerfang86> @doc_ock_rokc other than the searing pain how was it
[3:52:08] <collind99> Shouldny it be left hand magic?
[3:52:12] <Zombrocom> It's the one with no life bar
[3:52:13] <+andiwaffles> is Fool's Idol harder than Pinwheel and Witches of Hemwick or whatever?
[3:52:14] <%wruce__billis> bnro she was right next to you wtf
[3:52:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tigerfang86 Very Sweet
[3:52:23] <Onamar> Leaving one alive is fine, if you aren't near it he looks at the real boss
[3:52:25] <+CannonHeroBrett> no small heath bar
[3:52:27] <+tigerfang86> nice
[3:52:34] <LunacyRosier> I like how they kept the goofy shock animation
[3:52:38] <Sunstalker> Why? They show where the runes are. it's helpful
[3:52:43] <AFlyingTaco1> @andiwaffles Everything is harder than Pinwheel.
[3:52:50] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Don't step on the rakes, Sideshow Bob
[3:52:52] <+arenamecha> arenamecha subscribed with Prime.
[3:52:59] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Think we'll get the 6th Archestone as DLC later on?

[3:53:37] <akitanito> pat is the true himbo

[3:53:41] <%wruce__billis> you're such a himbo pat
[3:53:43] <%juxtest> I cant believe they didn't take that out
[3:53:45] <studleydoorite> I need to find a woman who loves getting pelted with fire
[3:53:53] <%ZephynM> Seems like an oversight or a nice little detail that's easy to miss they put in the game.
[3:53:56] <+deviljhojho_> just go to arizona
[3:54:02] <niozonbi> Yeah, ranged attacks are so good here
[3:54:02] <DeathByPoke7> good rng
[3:54:04] <mattymcfilth> why does the boss sound like paige if she did an evil laugh tho
[3:54:04] <Zombrocom> Pat truely was the Fool's Idol all along

[3:54:20] <%T_Sasquatch> It's definitely not intended
[3:54:23] <BuffaTV> isnt that health bar thing in like a couple other souls games?
[3:54:24] <$ezackazneyes> haHaa

[3:54:35] <+andiwaffles> so it doesn't say YOU DESTROYED anymore lol
[3:54:39] <DSD24> Her theme was better in the PS3 version
[3:54:40] <ScreamLord> Well she fooled ya once
[3:54:41] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Now go help some people so your World Tendency is WHITE
[3:54:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> I won't be fooled again YYYYYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
[3:54:46] <EuropanLamprey> "You're magical cloning ability is no match for my ability to see the HUD!"
[3:54:50] <tetriata> So I wonder if it's still possible to slide around the altar and get the Babies Nail without triggering the cutscene
[3:54:56] <%ZephynM> Boss didn't look as tough once the health bar was figured out
[3:55:00] <+deviljhojho_> fool me once shame on you fool me twice..... cant be fooled again
[3:55:02] <%maenos2> they could've gone with won't get fooled again, but didnt. lqme.
[3:55:09] <+eanscrale> It's because the server
[3:55:12] <Onamar> Killing a boss makes it go back towards white too remember
[3:55:12] <+andiwaffles> it changes at Nexus
[3:55:12] <DSD24> Well did you look at it?
[3:55:14] <+twohitgood> the tendency doesn't change until you go back to nexus, right?
[3:55:15] <+deviljhojho_> you gon kill yourself or what
[3:55:18] <+deviljhojho_> or is that how it works
[3:55:18] <+SinisterBroccoli> you need to leave for it to take effect
[3:55:18] <Sunstalker> it updates only when turning to the nexus, no?
[3:55:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @deviljhojho_ YYYYEEEAAAAHHHHH!!!!
[3:55:21] <%T_Sasquatch> One day i wish for a hudless game
[3:55:27] <ScreamLord> The server is EVIL
[3:55:27] <bashful_bard> Think you're at true neutral atm
[3:55:28] <+MoonObscure> D:
[3:55:28] <DSD24> Aww yeah its the bois
[3:55:29] <Gallhint> These guys!
[3:55:29] <+andiwaffles> @twohitgood exactly
[3:55:31] <+SuicidalLemmming> it updates when you return to the nexus or load another area
[3:55:34] <DSD24> I love these guys
[3:55:36] <Cerabret100> didn't they say they'd make tendency easier to read/determine? i don't feel like they did
[3:55:37] <+MoonObscure> EVAL
[3:55:39] <+deviljhojho_> @doc_ock_rokc crikCool
[3:55:42] <+tigerfang86> why do souls characters always get carried by bats
[3:55:44] <niozonbi> spooky, yet familiar
[3:55:44] <Meekest> Trailer shot
[3:55:44] <Gallhint> off to anor londo!
[3:55:45] <rekinom> Time for them to take you to Anal Rodeo
[3:55:46] <+SuicidalLemmming> not a lot changes after the first boss though
[3:55:48] <%wruce__billis> there's always that one guy who does nothing
[3:55:49] <+tigerfang86> always with the bat demons
[3:55:50] <Bloodninja15> To Anor Londo
[3:55:51] <+deviljhojho_> damn gargos
[3:55:53] <%aishman> Man Miyazaki-san really loves monsters carrying you up and dropping you down in a new area huh?
[3:55:54] <fuji_92> his character tendency changed not his world, chat they are different things... and yeah tendency only refreshes after u hit nexus
[3:55:56] <%G_Thunders> Omg it’s the thing they kept reusing for some reason
[3:55:57] <+sermittens> How many souls game do you get carried away?
[3:56:04] <+TheBitingIrish> "You're welcome, loser!"
[3:56:05] <AFlyingTaco1> I agree that this is the coolest area in the game, though
[3:56:07] <LunacyRosier> wow this game ripped off dark souls
[3:56:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tigerfang86 Because the bat demon union has a contract with From
[3:56:08] <cuhrice1> theyre gonna take u to Brazil
[3:56:08] <+deviljhojho_> man tower is so cool

[3:56:27] <niozonbi> da moon
[3:56:28] <jorniev> THIS IS BERSERK LAND
[3:56:28] <+twohitgood> @Cerabret100 it's easier to read what the tendency is. the rules determining how it works is still obtuse AF.
[3:56:31] <%Faustgesicht> dat's some spooky bullshit
[3:56:31] <rjhascancer> SO COOOOOL
[3:56:33] <+tigerfang86> here we are
[3:56:36] <%wruce__billis> @G_Thunders I get the impression it's one of the passages Miyazaki actually undertsood from those English fantasy novels he read when he was a kid and it made a huge impression on him
[3:56:37] <NitronStreams> is that Castlevania?
[3:56:37] <%NovaKnightmare> the Fart Zone
[3:56:38] <niozonbi> hey look its bloodborne

[3:56:46] <niozonbi> dats a bloodborne alright
[3:56:47] <%juxtest> This is the level I think of when I think of Demons Souls

[3:56:47] <%ZephynM> That looks pretty awesome
[3:56:48] <$Dakuu75> sexy
[3:56:50] <%AlphaTauri> too scary
[3:56:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look at that Castlevania bullshit
[3:56:51] <+tweedler92> Oooohhhhhhhh
[3:56:53] <rjhascancer> now lets never look at it again
[3:56:54] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It even has Fetuses of God in it
[3:56:55] <Make_me_mad> Upper Latria is the coolest and most fucked area in the Souls series. Looks like a goddamn metal album cover.
[3:56:55] <chromonaut747> VIDEOGAME ASS ZONE
[3:56:56] <%mikessdd> This is indeed 3D castelvania
[3:56:58] <%Broken_Sonex> LOOK AT THAT BLOODBORN
[3:57:00] <2deep5u> they bloodborneified the level retroactively
[3:57:00] <+Grayhammatter> i see you like to play castlevania
[3:57:00] <%ZephynM> Not gonna lie, wish this were on PC so I could play it but I'm probably gonna have to wait.
[3:57:02] <+andiwaffles> Miyazaki said he wanted Bloodborne to feel like Latria right?
[3:57:02] <%maenos2> lol
[3:57:03] <%G_Thunders> I see a bloodborne
[3:57:03] <+Pyroclase> Is this harder than original DeS?
[3:57:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Whats with the blue shadows?
[3:57:07] <%KaiserMario> Pure white char. tend.= Frind Ring from Monumental, Pure black char. tend. = Mephistofeles shows up for NPC kill quest
[3:57:07] <CandyCoatedConfection> it's so damn pretty
[3:57:14] <collind99> Which world is maneater in
[3:57:16] <jorniev> HUMAN FACED LIZARD FISH SPIDERS WERE GREAT

[3:57:24] <+twohitgood> soul ray more like soul good
[3:57:28] <+chvmpchange> PC version is very likely down the line folks

[3:57:59] <jorniev> YEA
[3:57:59] <%shurtal> Soul Ray, the sadder brother of Sugar Ray
[3:58:01] <+andiwaffles> poggers
[3:58:01] <+chvmpchange> there's no way two seperate games made the same trailer error without it meaning something
[3:58:03] <+twohitgood> too bad they didn't add a training dummy. that would have been a great QoL change.
[3:58:04] <amcracken> Das a good sound
[3:58:06] <jorniev> thas the good shit
[3:58:10] <chromonaut747> gg no re demon souls

[3:58:52] <+TheBitingIrish> wot
[3:58:53] <Oxybe> Everybody Loves Soul Raymond
[3:58:53] <TheFilth> the order in which to do each world always spooked me on my playthrough
[3:59:05] <DSD24> Soul Ray!
[3:59:05] <+deviljhojho_> Not bad!
[3:59:09] <+TheBitingIrish> o
[3:59:10] <%KaiserMario> That was true for the og too
[3:59:10] <%UvBenServed> Stonks
[3:59:17] <bashful_bard> Cool
[3:59:22] <%wruce__billis> Dman, Stonefang looks fucking great
[3:59:34] <taquito_blade> did I miss the maneater???
[3:59:35] <+deviljhojho_> Anti frustration features
[3:59:38] <%aishman> That happened to me sadly
[3:59:42] <bashful_bard> It was true for og in the archstone
[3:59:43] <DSD24> The epitome of spite
[3:59:45] <rekinom> Considering getting a PS5, if only so I can play bloodborne again (sold my ps4 a year ago)
[3:59:45] <collind99> This looks like the PS5 showcase trailer
[3:59:46] <amonimis> do you have enough for next estoc upgrade now?
[3:59:47] <DSD24> @taquito_blade Not yet
[3:59:48] <+deviljhojho_> nah man he just arrived to uper laria
[3:59:50] <collind99> Very deserty
[4:00:00] <legendaryemerald> it always brought them back when you beat a boss pat
[4:00:03] <taquito_blade> @dsd24 thank god
[4:00:04] <%T_Sasquatch> I swear demon souls was the first game sbfp streamed
[4:00:13] <%KaiserMario> They respawned after you kill bosses in og too, I'm sure...
[4:00:19] <%G_Thunders> That was always how it worked
[4:00:19] <+deviljhojho_> yeah i think it was the first stream no?
[4:00:23] <+deviljhojho_> or was that the ending of fire red?
[4:00:27] <rekinom> What other games are worth getting for the PS5?
[4:00:28] <tetriata> @PatStaresAt Crystal lizards don't lose their respawn count when they get away now. It makes that one room in 2-2 with fifty crystal lizards busted
[4:00:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> i wonder what merchants in these games do with the souls
[4:00:30] <taquito_blade> oof
[4:00:33] <+tigerfang86> I thought it was Firered
[4:00:36] <+tigerfang86> then demon souls
[4:00:38] <AFlyingTaco1> I hope he gets to the Maneaters in this stream. I need to see him job to them.
[4:00:45] <+chvmpchange> it's when they got into streaming seriously
[4:00:47] <fuji_92> imagine being this dense OpieOP
[4:00:48] <BurdRightsActivist> is Pure Bladestone still Kappa ?
[4:00:56] <taquito_blade> so you can farm now?
[4:00:58] <BuffaTV> I can be denser
[4:00:59] <Noogiez> scum farm?
[4:01:06] <+deviljhojho_> perhaps
[4:01:06] <+tigerfang86> definitely some Kappa
[4:01:07] <+chvmpchange> thats why woolie has the demons souls stream layout still
[4:01:09] <+deviljhojho_> then again, perhaps not
[4:01:13] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye luck
[4:01:13] <legendaryemerald> they delay between you talking about the not-despawning and the boss respawning confused me, then.
[4:01:19] <fuji_92> @buffatv if I'm honest, me too
[4:01:21] <%wruce__billis> I hope PBS is still bullshit
[4:01:21] <%T_Sasquatch> Im finished Kreygasm

[4:02:00] <bashful_bard> The merchant in 1-1 or 1-2 sells them cheaper
[4:02:01] <tetriata> The dregling in 1-1 and 1-2 is a good early game grass merchant
[4:02:01] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh boy
[4:02:05] <%The_UnfathoMarble> 4-2 is a good spot

[4:05:08] <mr_slaide> If Paige was there, she would also be in pain.
[4:05:18] <chaos2frozen> is there any benefits to dual wielding weapons in Demon Souls? It's not like you'll be able to swing faster using L1-R1_L1 etc.
[4:05:19] <rekinom> This skeleton rolls into the club and smack's your girls ass, what do you do?
[4:05:20] <%SirKeigan> Cinematic camera moves out a bit

[4:09:50] <%tusk102> they changed it bu for some reason slime is worse than "Stuff" because it implies it's thick

[4:28:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> I'd refuse my heals not for honor but for psaGoblin
[4:28:28] <%Valdorick> Also, not healing sucker 'honorable' players into not healing
[4:28:30] <%KineKithZen> Real hotep character hours
[4:28:39] <collind99> Is there any way to turn character tendency back?
[4:28:41] <+RobocopSanchez> no honor among these parts, just dubs
[4:28:41] <Arek_1> There's an item you missed here at the courtyard.
[4:28:42] <%YakumoYomi> I don't like the way you said "black"... psaSmug

[4:28:46] <bashful_bard> Now go help Meph murder all your npcs
[4:28:48] <GameOver_Here> Wow Pat's a troll piece of shit, who'd of thunk it.
[4:28:50] <%Valdorick> Remember kids - honor gets you killed.
[4:28:53] <Butterjawgaming> This pat has NO HONOUR
[4:28:55] <%KaiserMario> Is the world ready for pure black Pat tendency?

[4:28:59] <%Captainahab_37> i think if you help out other people tendency gets whiter?
[4:29:04] <%Captainahab_37> i cant remember
[4:29:11] <+Conzanagi> Honour is for nerds
[4:29:12] <+Onlysamfisher > Onlysamfisher  subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months!
[4:29:23] <%Onlysamfisher > 11 months BABY
[4:29:28] <BurdRightsActivist> @heartlesshealer the more you help people out, the whiter and NOT BLACK you become. Pure Black is gained by killing players and NPCs, and ups your invader damage
[4:29:40] <%TheDavidCage> TheDavidCage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[4:29:42] <GameOver_Here> I hope Pat gets his spine broken by a barrel, in real life.
[4:29:54] <%heartlesshealer> @BurdRightsActivist Ah, thank you for the info!
[4:29:57] <GameOver_Here> lol jk
[4:29:58] <%juxtest> Demons Souls' brutal death penalty encouraged PvP and other player interactions more than any other Souls game if you ask me
[4:29:58] <+RobocopSanchez> i agree
[4:30:02] <BuffaTV> I hope Pat has a good day :)
[4:30:03] <%KineKithZen> Pat isn't Worf man

[4:30:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I hope that pat loses his consumable items

[4:30:17] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> in Minecraft
[4:30:18] <+Grayhammatter> pat is secretly worf

[4:30:29] <%Maids4lyfe> that barrel has no honor
[4:30:29] <%leinadtonu> How horrible are we talking about?
[4:30:31] <Parapattern> Paige is already suffering that fate
[4:30:32] <%TheDavidCage> Barrels are the number one leading causes of death for ginger dwarfs, the more you know
[4:30:32] <%Gojibruh> Pat is Klingon?
[4:30:34] <fuji_92> lol jk is good enough now LUL
[4:30:34] <%AzureGale> Some good otherworldly sounds in this game
[4:30:35] <RushUnplugged> "just a prank bro" doesn't justify being a shitcunt
[4:30:38] <@SoFarFetched> joke delivery is really important or else it sounds really harsh. geefBruh
[4:30:40] <%Captainahab_37> I hope pat grows a third arm irl
[4:30:42] <%afronooch> yeah, i hope Pat breaks MY back
[4:30:42] <+RobocopSanchez> hope pat has a wonderful thanksgiving, that motherfucker
[4:30:43] <%Puhff> wow chat is mean tonight
[4:30:44] <%Gojibruh> Kaplah
[4:30:46] <Grandma_Amari> The barrel that broke Paige's spine has NO HONOR.
[4:30:49] <ChungusQuest> Pat is more Romulan than Klingon
[4:30:52] <%Puhff> between that and "please die: lol
[4:30:53] <TomFrancis_> I hope Pat enjoys his time in general
[4:30:54] <CatmanIX> "lol jk", the most heartfelt apology LUL

[4:31:02] <%Gojibruh> That barrel has no honor
[4:31:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's not joke delivery, it's joke digiorno's
[4:31:11] <Gamer76255> We all know barrels break backs, just ask Warf
[4:31:11] <+CapnClassix> How did Paige screw her back up?
[4:31:14] <%Minicow1> Pat is more Cardassian than Romulan
[4:31:14] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Only room for ONE horrible spine injury in the Boivin household
[4:31:15] <alwayspronking> oooh its a star-trek thing
[4:31:15] <%leinadtonu> Is Pat the barrel that broke Paige's back?

[4:31:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> is Paige just Mr Glass
[4:32:00] <@SoFarFetched> Her backs still pretty bad right now which is why she isn't really in the streams these days.
[4:32:00] <Meekest> I also thought Pat was gonna say he blew it out
[4:32:00] <%AzureGale> ded
[4:32:01] <%Gojibruh> my shoulder feel broken when I sneeze

[4:32:16] <ChungusQuest> time to get back to HONORABLE work
[4:32:19] <%leinadtonu> So what you're saying is that Paige sneezed a barrel...
[4:32:20] <+Conzanagi> That skeleton had the DLC weapon
[4:32:21] <EuropanLamprey> Gravity, the most dangerous boss of all Souls Games
[4:32:23] <+TheBitingIrish> A sneeze uses your entire torso, so that's understandable
[4:32:23] <%dekkitout> How much to get Paige an adamantium skeleton
[4:32:23] <%Captainahab_37> the reloading is so fuckin crisp
[4:32:25] <%promessav2> Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
[4:32:26] <+Jaysky> Hopefully she doesn't need to get one of those spine fusion surgeries
[4:32:27] <bashful_bard> Back pain sucks
[4:32:34] <niozonbi> ooh
[4:32:39] <%Captainahab_37> good parry
[4:32:40] <%Onlysamfisher > I forget, is good old Patches in this one?
[4:32:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Lumbago
[4:32:43] <TheFilth> the scrubs nourish the ego
[4:32:44] <TomFrancis_> or people who frequently make new characters
[4:32:44] <%Gojibruh> tru
[4:32:47] <CatmanIX> ayyyy, I've done that, not so badly but put me out a few days, hope she feels better soon
[4:32:47] <frozenottsel> just like normal fighting games : D
[4:32:50] <+TimberWulfe> OH, that's why you invade after a death!
[4:32:51] <%ssjklyco> So Pat and Pat
[4:32:54] <akitanito> big whiff
[4:32:54] <BuffaTV> Aren't these supposed players "who don't know what they are doing" the ones killing you repeatedly
[4:32:54] <EuropanLamprey> Or proto-twinks
[4:32:55] <Grandma_Amari> I miss when Playstation online was free, was a big reason to have a PS3.
[4:32:55] <LunacyRosier> and peole with ghosts carrying them through the game
[4:32:56] <%Puhff> like Roflsaurus here
[4:32:58] <niozonbi> lol
[4:33:00] <%Caped_Eggy> What about people who knows what they are doing, so they keep their lvl low?
[4:33:01] <%Valdorick> My dad has sneezed so hard he literally tore the skin that keeps your spine attached to your back.
[4:33:01] <%Anime_Flux> this guy knows what he's doing
[4:33:01] <%Captainahab_37> whats the armor with the funny bunny ears again
[4:33:02] <NitronStreams> but pat which are you?
[4:33:03] <churropoppa> Page is a medical marvel. That's coming from someone who pees himself into paralysis.
[4:33:03] <%leinadtonu> Paige should get one of those cool exoskeletons
[4:33:04] <%Captainahab_37> thats a cool one
[4:33:05] <+Goblinz_3> LUL
[4:33:07] <+CrunchyFrog_> dragon long sword?
[4:33:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> infused?
[4:33:08] <%AzureGale> There are 10 types of people - those who know binary, and those who don't
[4:33:10] <%Maids4lyfe> a fire sword
[4:33:10] <%wruce__billis> +10 weapon on an SL1 character
[4:33:11] <%YourFavoriteShiba> *Paige sneezes* Her spine: "You have elected for the way of Pain!"
[4:33:11] <Vermillion129> Lvl 40 invasion with dragon bone snasher is hilarious
[4:33:12] <%heartlesshealer> lag???
[4:33:12] <%SirKeigan> Dragon Long Sword from 2-2
[4:33:14] <%Minicow1> he knew
[4:33:15] <$Timesteel> dragon sword probably
[4:33:15] <+silversaxophone> fire longsword from 2-2 probably
[4:33:18] <fuji_92> point blank flame toss
[4:33:18] <+Goblinz_3> So he knows what he was doing then lmao
[4:33:19] <+SuicidalLemmming> mans got the dragon longsword +1
[4:33:22] <%heartlesshealer> but yeah he knew
[4:33:22] <%trustycoyote> For example, this dude
[4:33:23] <+TheBitingIrish> I would have died laughing if that dude had run away after they circled each other
[4:33:33] <%Anime_Flux> Is progress being made? I can't tell...
[4:33:35] <%Captainahab_37> what if pat didnt know what he was doing all along and this is a con
[4:33:39] <%Maids4lyfe> What bug?
[4:33:52] <%SirKeigan> First enemy didn't have a visible sword
[4:34:05] <critiquequartz> I saw a build your own skeleton kit and all I could think about was paige
[4:34:13] <%wruce__billis> @Maids4lyfe apparently the skellies aren;t holding swords sometimes, I can't tell tho i'm watching at like 180p
[4:34:19] <%KaiserMario> Negative Progress
[4:34:33] <%Maids4lyfe> @wruce__billis ah thank you
[4:34:38] <%SirKeigan> His last life was the furthest he got in this level, up to the first Gold Skeleton
[4:34:39] <%Anime_Flux> maybe because it's hopping from pvp to pve a lot, but yeah seems like the same place/enemies
[4:34:39] <Oxybe> These rolling skeletons always make me laugh when i see someone else fight them. they goofy as shit
[4:34:42] <fuji_92> or Regress
[4:34:52] <%Captainahab_37> valley of defilement is the worst with that shit
[4:35:03] <%Maids4lyfe> pat died to the golden papyrus?
[4:35:09] <%Lone_Xeno> This game looks like a Shadow or Mordor but with the shitty but good Souls movement
[4:35:14] <+CapnClassix> Roll down from teh other side of that archway
[4:35:19] <TheFilth> oh to be a flying manta ray
[4:35:27] <%Minicow1> Help I know nothing about Demon's Souls. What weapon is he using?
[4:35:29] <AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt I think you have to roll off the top of the tower for that one
[4:35:32] <$Timesteel> could just take the skip, it’s still in the game
[4:35:40] <+Grayhammatter> a falchion
[4:35:47] <+CapnClassix> Roll down from there
[4:35:49] <%KaiserMario> Hey Pat, you doing ok buddy? you looking tired already!
[4:35:58] <Arek_1> @PatStaresAt Did you grab the Kilij curved sword here?
[4:35:59] <%tusk102> @Minicow1 crescent falchion. a falchion with magic infused in it. it's notorious for being busted
[4:36:01] <LunacyRosier> please dont hurt the skeletons BibleThump
[4:36:01] <+CapnClassix> Get that health ring
[4:36:04] <%Captainahab_37> does dragon god still have 12 fingers for maximum grip?
[4:36:05] <@SoFarFetched> you would
[4:36:06] <+silversaxophone> since they deliberately left the skip in, that means it's not cheating Kappa
[4:36:06] <%Anime_Flux> jeeezus man
[4:36:09] <UlriktheSlayer1> jesus
[4:36:09] <+tigerfang86> you were MASTERING BUISINESS
[4:36:09] <akitanito> but it was great
[4:36:16] <$laazybulbasaur> @PatStaresAt are you still enjoying the haptic feedback?
[4:36:16] <+tigerfang86> making MAXIMUM MONEY
[4:36:23] <ChungusQuest> business takes time to perfect
[4:36:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> tbf that minigame looked really fun
[4:36:25] <%penitentpendant> That rare time "Grinding Offscreen" was one on screen
[4:36:32] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> Demon souls!
[4:36:36] <devanmuse> all worth it for that dosh, huh?
[4:36:37] <%Captainahab_37> i still dont understand what haptic feedback is
[4:36:38] <Thepothero> yeah that was good makin all dat cash
[4:36:44] <blackbookalpha> Was Elden Ring real btw?
[4:36:49] <%penitentpendant> Pat arguing with chat over every decision, doing it his way, and winning
[4:36:49] <akitanito> it's just vibration
[4:36:53] <+Fenrein> Do you fix your sleep schedule after a night like that or just succumb to the night life?
[4:36:58] <akitanito> haptic = touch
[4:37:01] <%Captainahab_37> elden who? never heard of her
[4:37:07] <dots4eyes> Those sounds effects are so meaty...love it
[4:37:07] <%Minicow1> The glowing review of the haptic feedback has pretty much convinced me to get a PS5 at some point
[4:37:15] <moosemonkey397> is the adjudicator shiled the one that passively regens health?
[4:37:18] <%KaiserMario> Kyle Bosman was saying he couldn't tell much difference from the Switch and I couldn't tell if he was doing a bit... LUL
[4:37:20] <+CapnClassix> I think Pat's been on that night life
[4:37:23] <%Lone_Xeno> It's legitimately just so strange to see a souls game with such polished graphics. I'm used to seeing dark souls 3 and thinking that DS3 was the best we would ever get
[4:37:25] <%maenos2> Hey he remembered!
[4:37:27] <%trustycoyote> @Captainahab_37 Know how a speaker works? It's that but used for vibration

[4:40:07] <VirtuaRailith> I don't think I could train gief because he's too cute.
[4:40:08] <%Maids4lyfe> so what happens at black tendency?
[4:40:17] <Hellarussian> foiled by rocks
[4:40:19] <+Conzanagi> They roll more than actually players
[4:40:35] <BurdRightsActivist> @Maids4lyfe monster's stronger, black phantoms and primordial demons spawn
[4:40:38] <%Lone_Xeno> Would this game be like... a porn game for paige since it has all these skeleTONs in it?
[4:41:04] <UlriktheSlayer1> you :)
[4:41:13] <%gstut1> yeah cause they got huge boners
[4:41:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @Maids4lyfe it's generally better to gun for pure black sometimes because you can get some very rare items from the black phantoms, and the demons give you upgrade materials
[4:41:47] <BurdRightsActivist> @Maids4lyfe that's if you can handle it, though
[4:41:48] <%Maids4lyfe> oh okay
[4:41:48] <LunacyRosier> its a berserk reference
[4:41:51] <%Lone_Xeno> Paige needs skeleton boners to fix her ass bones
[4:41:58] <devanmuse> is the black katana skeleton a black skeleton with a katana? or a skeleton with a black katana?
[4:41:59] <%Maids4lyfe> interesting
[4:42:02] <%wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt How would you feel about a display option which reproduces the hisdeous FPS drops of the OG game
[4:42:02] <%MrBorisMakarov> so is pat at red tendency or smth because that doesn't look like black tendency
[4:42:08] <%Maids4lyfe> @BurdRightsActivist thank you for explaining it
[4:42:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> the Stormy bois sound like the Metal Gear alert sound
[4:42:13] <%maenos2> I dig the green glass shit the manga rays spew
[4:42:13] <UlriktheSlayer1> those flying mantas make cool sounds
[4:42:16] <%maenos2> manta
[4:42:23] <%Valdorick> Man, I just realized... think of the next anime tiddy game with haptic feedback
[4:42:28] <frozenottsel> I watched GamerNexus' teardown video of the PS5 controller, that thing is stuffed full of tech
[4:42:45] <blackbookalpha> @frozenottsel What he said
[4:42:47] <BurdRightsActivist> @Maids4lyfe no problem. White's kinda the opposite. Certain events and areas will only open up at pure white or pure black.
[4:42:48] <TheFilth> that skelly had poise
[4:42:49] <%Maids4lyfe> @Valdorick yeah but sony censors tiddy
