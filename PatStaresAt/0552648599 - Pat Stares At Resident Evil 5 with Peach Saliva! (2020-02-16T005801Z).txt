[0:52:12] <%Neo_Kaiser> HEY PAT! Suggest they watch my video!
[0:52:13] <%vaporousTippler> The movie was great when everyone was starved for FF7 back in the 2000s.
[0:52:13] <%rytyoung> WATCH IT WITH CLUBFOOT KASABIEN
[0:52:13] <SlippedDisco> the only worthwhile part tbh
[0:52:13] <filialpails> it's a great action movie and has a great soundtrack, but the story doesn't live up to FF7 standards
[0:52:14] <%GabeSweetMan> It's alright. Not a fan of the floaty flying bullshit.
[0:52:16] <%Monkeyweed21> also the church fight with Tifa
[0:52:17] <%PanicSwytch> The Tifa fight too
[0:52:17] <%marvel877> What about the church fight?
[0:52:17] <Jetsfantasy> The Tifa fight scene with the piano collections as bg
[0:52:18] <santafer> But what about Dirge of Cerberus?

[1:01:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Zedimonx5 Yeah, we don't even get paid for this shit lol
[1:01:05] <A_Windmill> gotta drop your shield

[1:01:07] <Psych_man13_13> DS2 when?
[1:01:09] <+Skelegroove> Bloodborne makes you wait a while for the more interesting weapons
[1:01:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Bllodborne works more with your style
[1:01:12] <%OwlLightningMage> DS3 DLCS sucks with the exception of the final boss of Ringed City
[1:01:14] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I'm to chicken for Bloodbourne

[1:01:40] <AFlyingTaco1> @bane_kaikyo It's okay buddy - I've been alone my whole life, and I'm still barely here.
[1:01:42] <%sporeian94> 1 hr on the treadmill 1hr on weights
[1:01:43] <%Dragon_Batman> Ds1 is that good
[1:01:43] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt should i buy metal wolf chaos or deamon x machina?

[1:01:53] <%Dragon_Batman> Metal Wolf
[1:01:53] <%OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne wins because it had the best base game and DLC
[1:01:53] <%ElenaManetta> really?

[1:02:10] <SlippedDisco> monkaS
[1:02:11] <missingangle> okay with but I've absolutely watched the podcasts while on the treadmill and I've never died yet
[1:02:11] <TimetodiveLTX> BENCH PRESS DOESNT GIVE A FUCK
[1:02:12] <%Jokobeast> Benching without a spotter; that way lies death.
[1:02:12] <Hydrapissed> just do carido instead
[1:02:12] <+attackofthesage> I just make it a rule not to bench without a spotter

[1:02:18] <CptVolkow> AvE
[1:02:21] <DexteraXIII> Don't think about how important it is that you don't laugh.

[1:51:26] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[1:51:26] <%joylent_blue> paige LUL
[1:51:31] <%Sir_stride> like I said before, the electric stick is the red 9 of re5
[1:51:38] <+Megamanharv> Megamanharv subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:51:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> PAIGE
[1:51:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dat shotgun range
[1:51:40] <%natebud> Josh is hacking an elevator btw
[1:51:57] <Hellarussian> Paige and aiming mix as well as water and oil
[1:51:59] <%trustycoyote> I saw that, Paige. You ALMOST shot Pat
[1:52:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I do love RE melee
[1:52:01] <%patriotrenegade> HACKERMAN JOSH
[1:52:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I'm glad that Pat decided to try the melee protection item this time....But it does fucking suck that they consume inventory space. When in RE4 the tactical vest did not consume space
[1:52:08] <godsblister> I always enjoy seeing people run re5
[1:52:09] <+Jasuchin> Shitty single player, awesome co-op
[1:52:12] <Aydarkzero> time to leave
[1:52:18] <%MetroidSlayerP7> RE5 has its moments
[1:52:20] <%joylent_blue> holy fuck paige THE JUKES
[1:52:23] <%코코꾸라> phew
[1:52:27] <godsblister> Look just remove the pistol from sheva's inventory and her ai does fine
[1:52:28] <$PhantomMiG> Paige would do better if she burst fire instead of holding
[1:52:35] <Psych_man13_13> Pat, are you aware of the fun to be had with the freeze rounds?
[1:52:37] <%Sir_stride> @jasuchin I disagree. the single player is as bad as people say
[1:52:46] <%Sir_stride> isnt*
[1:52:53] <GUNxSPECTRE> AI is only good with infinite weapons
[1:53:00] <%patriotrenegade> save it for the chainsaw guy @PatStaresAt
[1:53:00] <bashful_bard> The grenade launcher is broken as shit
[1:53:03] <+Jasuchin> Still, this is played best multiplayer
[1:53:05] <%Megamanharv> Have we gotten to boulder punting yet?
[1:53:05] <+Antoids> lol
[1:53:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Too bad they didn't kill the fat guy. They do drop treasure, i believe.
[1:53:19] <%Sir_stride> nah. @gunxspectre give them a sniper and a MG and its gucci
[1:53:21] <bashful_bard> Flash and freeze rounds alone make it wild
[1:53:21] <+necrocannibal2> nice
[1:53:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paige said
[1:53:26] <%AdmiralButtloaf> Stick is OP
[1:53:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> nice
[1:53:30] <trianglehat> it's a back massager
[1:53:31] <Ion_Laser> ...
[1:53:33] <%MetroidSlayerP7> STICK it to em
[1:53:33] <KaseKaizer> Boulder punching is literally the end of the game
[1:53:36] <+necrocannibal2> I'm sure you do
[1:53:37] <xeros720> very powerful
[1:53:42] <studleydoorite> @trianglehat LUL
[1:53:43] <%trekkie11041> becky i got stick lemme smash
[1:53:45] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea big guy drops a necklace or something but, Pat is doing ok on moneys for now
[1:53:47] <+Skelegroove> What an incredible bio-weapon easily defeated by bullets and tasers
[1:53:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> HACKING
[1:53:55] <%patriotrenegade> I gave Sheva an infinite Deagle when I played RE5, as well as myself
[1:53:59] <%tiaramaki> monkaS
[1:53:59] <%joylent_blue> just stand at the bottom of the ladder and stun baton all of them
[1:53:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kappa
[1:54:03] <Aydarkzero> hallway time!
[1:54:06] <%jobbedbone> cant hide that stick, divide that stick
[1:54:07] <+Pilzkun> Is peach ok she looks like she's having a rough time
[1:54:20] <%joylent_blue> that's normal Pilzkun
[1:54:23] <+Pilzkun> true
[1:54:24] <%xUmbraNinja> psaGib
[1:54:27] <+Jasuchin> That was almost such a disaster
[1:54:31] <Hellarussian> no
[1:54:40] <%patriotrenegade> Now is the time to magdump Beige
[1:54:40] <godsblister> Pat is correct, yeah.
[1:54:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> "I'm in!"
[1:54:48] <%Sir_stride> one thing I hate about this game is that theres only one save file. you have to actually delete the game data from the playstation menu. it sucks
[1:54:50] <%Megamanharv> "they get him"
[1:54:53] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the electric rod also works really when with the reapers(regenerator bugs) but with their up close instant death animation you need to let them be at the range of the tip of the rod swing
[1:54:56] <GUNxSPECTRE> lol I don't Matt even used the D-Pad shortcuts in the LP
[1:54:57] <Hellarussian> WOW
[1:54:57] <%patriotrenegade> Beige's compulsion to loot is strong
[1:54:59] <Hellarussian> FUCK
[1:55:00] <%joylent_blue> fucking AMAZING
[1:55:00] <tanarath> @patstaresat Peach, so glad you're getting into this. I feel like you aren't confident enough in yourself, and I'm glad you can show your talent.
[1:55:02] <KaseKaizer> Clap
[1:55:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good job Paige

[1:55:14] <+Jasuchin> Bye Elmo!
[1:55:15] <Speccu_> unironically i love this game
[1:55:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is it Beige or Baige
[1:55:16] <%MetroidSlayerP7> Wow?
[1:55:19] <+mankeyfigh> Where the HFIL is Irving
[1:55:19] <%tiaramaki> BibleThump Bye, Emlo
[1:55:21] <Ultimatefool> PEACE OUT
[1:55:22] <GUNxSPECTRE> Josh is S-Tier because he does suplexes and shit
[1:55:23] <%xUmbraNinja> Beige shoot dog
[1:55:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> (Banging noises)
[1:55:27] <Hellarussian> the trick is to be a sociopath
[1:55:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Did it
[1:55:30] <%natebud> You can ge a three hit combo on zombies if you start with an arm shot and stand on opposite sides. Last hit does magnum damage
[1:55:31] <%ospreyworks> Can’t stay—in the middle of a game of D&D, but I’ll be back for the VOD later tonight!
[1:55:32] <%patriotrenegade> no, once you leave the Manjini's sight line, they dea-ggro
[1:55:32] <%xUmbraNinja> psaGib
[1:55:33] <+necrocannibal2> the chainsaw majini could cut that door down anytime
[1:55:36] <studleydoorite> they know they're safe because the music stopped
[1:55:38] <%ShawnTK_> @mankeyfigh In the Irving mobile
[1:55:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> oh he's super dead
[1:55:41] <%alcors_wisdom> what hes going to get through a metal door with a chainsaw? i dont fuckin think so buddy boy
[1:55:43] <peachy996> STAY ALERT
[1:55:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> Josh: "????"
[1:55:47] <alexandrecau> josh is a legend
[1:55:47] <+Jasuchin> Ohai Elmo
[1:55:48] <Speccu_> Pat I desperately want a remake of this game thats based on the original concept of the game before the co-op
[1:55:48] <%tiaramaki> @ospreyworks Have fun!
[1:55:48] <leinadtonu> 1 for baige 2 for beige.
[1:55:49] <+necrocannibal2> ELMO
[1:55:52] <%patriotrenegade> 2
[1:55:53] <boomstickery> his arms arent human arms
[1:55:54] <%MetroidSlayerP7> RE hallmark: doors are walls to enemies
[1:56:00] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> never let the main character tell you to be careful
[1:56:02] <%tank7013> @Sir_stride It's even worse worse for the steam version. You've gotta manually corrupt the save file to force a new one because of cloud saves
[1:56:03] <+fugatlas> I'm on the last tome of the braves for my relic weapon
[1:56:03] <dukenux> and Josh! .............good luck
[1:56:04] <+fugatlas> wish me luck
[1:56:07] <%Tunnelcakesrule> HI ELMO I LOVE YOU
[1:56:10] <%patriotrenegade> I still think RE5 Chris is actually Krauser
[1:56:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I love Elmo more
[1:56:22] <+necrocannibal2> she'll never do this
[1:56:24] <+mankeyfigh> Has an enemy combatant ever been captured alive in the history of RE?
[1:56:27] <%camsool> No don't worry about it.
[1:56:30] <$serpenttucker> LUL
[1:56:32] <Aydarkzero> BIG
[1:56:38] <bashful_bard> Oh sweet child, the books are only the beginning of your suffering
[1:56:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:56:40] <%lionandfox21> Nah
[1:56:40] <CptVolkow> Big boom boom in his pants
[1:56:40] <Smaenus> A big boomer, you might say
[1:56:41] <%MetroidSlayerP7> Pro strats
[1:56:44] <%patriotrenegade> only to die later!
[1:56:46] <$Dakuu75> only to be experimented on
[1:56:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wouldn't Jill count as an enemy combatant?
[1:56:53] <alexandrecau> Ada
[1:56:54] <captnbellybutton> paige didnt retain anything you just said pat
[1:56:55] <%G_Thunders> Mia from RE7, sort of?
[1:56:56] <%KeystoneA1> The dude from Revelations 1
[1:56:58] <Drusain> where'd they go, bingo?
[1:57:03] <+necrocannibal2> Revelations 2?
[1:57:04] <%Conyst> Big Bada Boom
[1:57:05] <%Sir_stride> Ada? maybe?
[1:57:06] <%natebud> Ethan
[1:57:08] <dukenux> yeah Mia counts
[1:57:12] <KaseKaizer> wat
[1:57:12] <Hellarussian> hmm
[1:57:12] <%Megamanharv> Technically ethan and nia in RE7
[1:57:15] <%ssjklyco> Water
[1:57:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Steve LUL
[1:57:15] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat A thing I notice that paige does. She has a tendency to hold the trigger and waste ammo. She may want to burst fire and to stop shooting when moving target to target
[1:57:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ Is it true that the original concept of RE5 was a T virus outbreak in this part of Africa. Jill is the head of the BSAA and Chris and Berry are in there as mercenaries?
[1:57:17] <%Dragon_Batman> They usually turn themselves into huge monsters
[1:57:17] <%xUmbraNinja> ADA WAIT
[1:57:21] <%NWR_James> Has a T-Virus or related ever actually worked as was desired?
[1:57:23] <%patriotrenegade> NEVER THE HEROES
[1:57:23] <%MetroidSlayerP7> In Resident Evil universe, big booms are for women.
[1:57:28] <%patriotrenegade> WE WERE BORN TO FIGHT
[1:57:28] <+bubblebasspickles> the gyros?
[1:57:28] <%natebud> Ada was captured in RE4 at the end
[1:57:29] <%Megamanharv> If you count heroes being captured by villains
[1:57:32] <xeros720> COME ON
[1:57:34] <KaseKaizer> bote PogChamp
[1:57:42] <Drusain> get on the back of the boat
[1:57:45] <GUNxSPECTRE> RE-Fems have innate explosive weapons knowledge
[1:57:45] <%patriotrenegade> im on a boat
[1:57:46] <DrkJP520> Kenny's boat
[1:57:53] <dukenux> The Boat
[1:57:56] <%misha_kastrilevich> DARK SOULS
[1:57:59] <Shwepie> The only enemy combatant successfully captured by the heroes was Sherry Berkin.
[1:57:59] <dukenux> gotta get to it
[1:57:59] <%patriotrenegade> take a good hard look at the motherfuckin boat
[1:58:00] <%EuropanLamprey> Pat, is it comforting you can talk about spoilers in front of Paige knowing she won't remember them?
[1:58:00] <leinadtonu> boatmaster pat
[1:58:01] <+SlumberMan> Ashley gets captured like 4 times in RE4 by both Leon AND Saddler.
[1:58:03] <Zedimonx5> Oh fuck this part
[1:58:03] <%tank7013> @NWR_James I think Wesker is like the only example. And maybe Jake
[1:58:04] <%ElenaManetta> it's so
[1:58:04] <%patriotrenegade> shit's locked
[1:58:05] <%ElenaManetta> peaceful
[1:58:05] <%Zaxshimysham> Zaxshimysham subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! eewwww, I bet Pat kisses ladies and shakes his man ass while he does it. disgusting
[1:58:06] <Hellarussian> oh no
[1:58:07] <$Dakuu75> FUCK KENNY, you take his damn boat! lol
[1:58:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Boaty McBoatface
[1:58:08] <alexandrecau> they killed irvin yet
[1:58:13] <godsblister> This is gonna be fun
[1:58:14] <%Dragon_Batman> It's kool that there are boats there
[1:58:16] <Speccu_> @morcego_cinzento_arts IDK the story stuff but if you watch the first trailer you see there is much more of a focus on chris vs huge hordes of dudes like the entire game is the village fight at start of re4
[1:58:16] <%rytisone> it's time for a fireworks show
[1:58:19] <%patriotrenegade> SHIT'S STILL LOCKED
[1:58:21] <Hellarussian> this is where the fun begins
[1:58:29] <kouhi12> The mission broke
[1:58:31] <%NWR_James> @tank7013 that is an astonishingly low success rate
[1:58:31] <%camsool> its about to get all Speed 2 up in this bitch
[1:58:36] <%natebud> man if you sill had mines right now
[1:58:37] <kouhi12> that door is suppose to be locked
[1:58:50] <MassConnect> was there a speed 3?
[1:58:56] <%ElenaManetta> patoria's secret

[1:59:01] <Ion_Laser> @massconnect nope
[1:59:10] <MassConnect> that's how bad speed 2 is then
[1:59:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> are theey playing tag?
[1:59:14] <+necrocannibal2> @Megamanharv PS4 I think
[1:59:14] <bashful_bard> Looks like ps4
[1:59:18] <Speccu_> @morcego_cinzento_arts also there was neat stuff with the HDR like temporary blindess when exiting building for a split second and darkness entering a building and stuff
[1:59:21] <%NWR_James> It's PS4
[1:59:24] <%xUmbraNinja> It’s ps4
[1:59:27] <dukenux> maybe as a direct-to-dvd sequel @massconnect

[2:00:07] <Xiangchang> Sounded like Bugs Bunny.
[2:00:10] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ oh yeah i do remember that. they even had gameplay shot of him stuck in a actual dark shed room stuck with a much of enemies and only the muzzle flash of the rifle gave any light. Man that was a good teaser(chirs even had a different handgun)
[2:00:11] <captnbellybutton> irving that stupid weasel

[2:00:46] <tanarath> If only a pistol could accurately hit something 50 ft away!
[2:00:46] <dukenux> Man, i remember the video now, where someone replaced Irving's model with Wesker's LUL
[2:00:47] <%Madbearv> to beat the game
[2:00:49] <%blademaster247> So canonically do they have all those weapons or just the pistol and knife?
[2:00:51] <%KeystoneA1> Don't ask questions, just shoot Majini
[2:00:52] <godsblister> Huh, didn't know it spawned new barrels for this part
[2:00:56] <%Sir_stride> paige
[2:00:59] <Speccu_> @morcego_cinzento_arts I am a huge fan of re5 more than most people but I still wanna see that original version before co-op. its just impossible to have horror atmosphere in co-op imo

[2:04:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ There is legit good stuff in RE5 and even a lot of enhancements from the RE4 mechanics(like way more melee moves depending of where you are next to an enemy) But unfortunately for every upgrade they also made two downgrades. I wouldn't say it's impossible to make co-op scary. BUT it's so hard that it's kinda not worth the effort

[2:09:38] <sadolerlaqreet1> Can pat restart the game? I just got here
[2:09:39] <%warmnoid> paige is almost ded
[2:09:39] <+Dr_Mooose> *pulls out stick*
[2:09:41] <+D00msDayDan> immediately switches to stun rod
[2:09:45] <%zamzoph> great accuracy, Pat
[2:09:45] <GUNxSPECTRE> I will write the RE team to put Sheva in new games
[2:09:48] <%patriotrenegade> LOL
[2:09:51] <Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt Welcome back to "Paige wastes Ammo."
[2:09:57] <%ShawnTK_> they're already dead Paige
[2:09:58] <%warmnoid> bullets for the void
[2:10:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> Pat focuses on Paige's behind.
[2:10:02] <%Cruellatrix> @Zaphire_Saucypants oh really? sorry this is the first live stream i've been able to attend
[2:10:02] <%natebud> I doesn't sure if they're dead yet
[2:10:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ Yes, once you give sheva her bow or any weapon you spent point to make infinite, let them have it in the attack mode. But after playing that game with a ton of maxd out weapons the game was super generous with ammo(like i did runs with the bolt action rifle with it's 50 max bullets as a main against all enemies) i let her have the 100 ammo beretta and mp5 smg. Honestly i just save the point to make the magnum infinites cause they are the only ones that don't have a ammo drop from enemie
[2:10:10] <dukenux> you go that way, ill go home
[2:10:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Keep blasting Paige, you don't need that ammo
[2:10:16] <Psych_man13_13> Paige LOVES wasting ammo
[2:10:16] <GUNxSPECTRE> Also, RE6 has a pretty cool perk system
[2:10:23] <%xUmbraNinja> Man I don’t even remember this shit
[2:10:30] <%corepercentlives> imagine they all look like wooden boxes
[2:10:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> ammo is for losers, not the Big and Strong
[2:10:32] <%patriotrenegade> Maybe Pat SHOULD grind an infinite ammo weapon fro Paige
[2:10:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> monkaS
[2:10:45] <Psych_man13_13> QUICKTURN
[2:10:54] <%linSP> peach is doing it!!

[2:11:04] <%Oxybe> BIG and HELPFUL
[2:11:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Not even quickturn, just stop aiming before turning
[2:11:07] <%worldbrand> yeah
[2:11:08] <%patriotrenegade> yes, Kotaku
[2:11:08] <OToole42> have I missed much?
[2:11:08] <KeiPrime> you have to grind the RE6 perks tho
[2:11:08] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:11:10] <KeiPrime> dont you?
[2:11:12] <+PenmanLupine> Paige might actually help more if she just put the controller on the couch and just pet Elmo
[2:11:14] <tmix1600> This was the best RE. We need another co op RE main game
[2:11:16] <+mankeyfigh> some
[2:11:19] <bashful_bard> Not really
[2:11:22] <%Jekado> damn paige putting some shade on dean takahashi
[2:11:25] <+necrocannibal2> Paige is better than a lot of journalists
[2:11:29] <%patriotrenegade> pat do iy
[2:11:30] <%D3rrtyD4n> paige psaBig help
[2:11:32] <KeiPrime> its been a while so i dont recall
[2:11:32] <%natebud> like an re6 of sorts @tmix1600
[2:11:34] <%worldbrand> Just write your articles while sundowning and you'll hit the standard straightaway
[2:11:45] <KeiPrime> i played more of re6 in mercs mode which is kinda the shit
[2:11:51] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:11:53] <%SoFarFetched> YOU SURE SHOWED THAT FLOOR WHO'S BOSS
[2:11:54] <+necrocannibal2> that was lucky
[2:11:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @necrocannibal2 Most beings with a pulse are better than a lot of journalists, to be fair.
[2:11:55] <%Sir_stride> those I frames
[2:11:55] <bashful_bard> The good perks like damage and stamina up aren't crazy expensive
[2:11:57] <%tiaramaki> Holy crap LUL
[2:12:01] <tmix1600> RE5 is better than 6 though
[2:12:03] <+necrocannibal2> @SlimeSlimeSlime true
[2:12:08] <%Dragon_Batman> The invincible frames helped there
[2:12:09] <%alcors_wisdom> next pat should play cup head co-op with paige
[2:12:10] <dukenux> Paige, you beat Bloodborne. Your credentials are too strong for most gaming journo sites
[2:12:18] <bashful_bard> RE6 mercs is so fun
[2:12:18] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:12:19] <%D3rrtyD4n> he come from boat
[2:12:19] <%SoFarFetched> @alcors_wisdom They already did.
[2:12:20] <%natebud> like a rev 2 then @tmix1600
[2:12:21] <+necrocannibal2> PAIGE
[2:12:22] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I-frames for the win!
[2:12:23] <MyNameIsRasus> BIG BO(at)
[2:12:23] <Psych_man13_13> Paige hates both ammo and sick kicks
[2:12:24] <Alseid> why is Josh?
[2:12:25] <Dhurkst> nah, Paige is too principled & competent to get a game journalism position
[2:12:27] <Bryon_Youngblood> I wondered how far they guys were.
[2:12:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> I will give RE6 a 0.5 point for adult Sherry
[2:12:29] <%Oxybe> @dukenux lul
[2:12:30] <%alcors_wisdom> @SoFarFetched oh fuck
[2:12:34] <%Kegeto> lol oh Peach
[2:12:35] <%D3rrtyD4n> thanks josh
[2:12:36] <%KeystoneA1> ANNUDA PIPE
[2:12:41] <CrimsonFox777> Paige enjoys video games. She's clearly overqualified as is.
[2:12:42] <GUNxSPECTRE> Agent Sherry is great
[2:12:42] <%patriotrenegade> BEIGE
[2:12:45] <%SoFarFetched> @alcors_wisdom it's on youtube,think it's only a two parter though.
[2:12:48] <tanarath> Paige should play Doom 4, she's big and strong enough.
[2:12:51] <%MetroidSlayerP7> respect the pipe
[2:12:53] <Eldalu> Paige is doing great psaBig psaBig
[2:12:56] <KeiPrime> helena's slimy sister tho..
[2:13:05] <Bryon_Youngblood> @PatStaresAt Wow, Pat. X-D Jeez. But it's cool to see him playing with Paige like this :)
[2:13:05] <%alcors_wisdom> @SoFarFetched yeah i should probs look it up
[2:13:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ I never played the co-op of RE5(none of my friends had this game) But yeah from watching it's easy to tell how good it is(they just needed to fix thatfucking hsitty split screen) I hear people telling me that the mercenaries in RE6 is quite good but i never played RE6 so i wouldn't know
[2:13:08] <%majima666> so supposedly the ps5 wont sound like a jet engine when in use
[2:13:16] <tmix1600> I dont own revs but i want a actual story not episodes
[2:13:16] <%Dragon_Batman> Good
[2:13:30] <suikudo> dude she just said there was a red
[2:13:33] <Bryon_Youngblood> @majima666 I can only imagine the kind of hardware it and the XBOX Series X are gonna be running...
[2:13:34] <bashful_bard> PS4 only gets that way from dust buildup
[2:13:39] <%NWR_James> SHIT! OTHER LEFT
[2:13:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Remember that shotgun is at the back end of this pier
[2:13:43] <%SoFarFetched> Sweaty poops
[2:13:52] <%ElenaManetta> faster than a speeding bulet
[2:13:56] <%rytisone> only if you Naruto run
[2:13:58] <%D3rrtyD4n> jesus
[2:14:00] <+necrocannibal2> the thing about guns is that they only work at melee range
[2:14:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> too fast, for the naked eye
[2:14:07] <%patriotrenegade> yeah this part sucks
[2:14:12] <%majima666> yeah, i figure dust is a factor but im too paranoid to open it up to properly clean it lol
[2:14:18] <%ElenaManetta> when paige has to kill zombies she makes the poop noises
[2:14:21] <tanarath> Run faster than BULLAT, Paige!
[2:14:24] <%patriotrenegade> i remember this part going the exact same way during the LP
[2:14:30] <%majima666> i do vaccum the vents every month or so though
[2:14:38] <Speccu_> @morcego_cinzento_arts re6 has a lot less iframes so mercs is more about chaining parries than chaining melee kills
[2:14:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I'll go home
[2:14:59] <bashful_bard> Canned air and a screwdriver is all you need. It's pretty safe to clean
[2:15:00] <%Nina96> treasure?
[2:15:00] <OToole42> ran past a gem
[2:15:02] <+tsatoma> A Pear Sapphire POG
[2:15:05] <GUNxSPECTRE> The M3 shotgun is so fucking sexy
[2:15:11] <Bryon_Youngblood> Anyone know if Pat and Paige said anything about doing Lost in Nightmares or the Jill and Josh story?
[2:15:14] <GUNxSPECTRE> It's got the best damage of the shotguns right?
[2:15:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> PogChamp

[2:15:46] <%Niney_Who> mix your handgun ammo pat
[2:15:46] <Psych_man13_13> fully upgraded, the M3 does like 900
[2:15:57] <sadolerlaqreet1> She is big and strong danD
[2:16:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Speccu_ Also a weird detail in that game is that the mercenary alternative custome for Piers is a sports bike racer jumpsuit. Much like Elza Walkers inRE 1.5
[2:16:10] <+lethallylactic> nice
[2:16:12] <+SlumberMan> That makes total sense though, since Chris is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[2:16:16] <CandyCoatedConfection> not to mention the ugly color scheme and lack or horror.
[2:16:19] <%Dragon_Batman> She hasn't used her handgun once so far
[2:16:19] <%ElenaManetta> i regret this big steak i ate
[2:16:20] <dukenux> it steeres into action a bit too much
[2:16:21] <%natebud> Enemies aren't unlimited here, music is just tense always
[2:16:22] <bashful_bard> Yeah M3 is highest damage by a lot of the main 3
[2:16:33] <%trekkie11041> DRAWER
[2:16:37] <tanarath> I wish they kept the attache case.
[2:16:39] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta Did you make a ....missteak?
[2:16:41] <MyNameIsRasus> @ElenaManetta That's a good regret to have
[2:16:42] <Speccu_> @morcego_cinzento_arts oh shit i never made that connection
[2:16:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @ElenaManetta Good steak at 10 is a gamble
[2:16:48] <%ElenaManetta> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:16:51] <gade177> so how good is this game on a scale from 1 to 10?
[2:16:54] <Bryon_Youngblood> @CandyCoatedConfection Yeah, but that also comes from how Resident Evil had evolved to this kind of prospects since RE4, and ending it for now in RE6. At least RE7 went back to some of the original's roots.

[2:17:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Revelations 2*
[2:17:47] <bashful_bard> It has a lot of replay value so it's like an 8 or 9 for me

[2:18:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> If i remember it right with the shotguns. the ithaca shotgun has the best critical moddifier, the M93 has the best base damage, street sweeper has much more ammo reserve. and the special shotgun hydra has very good range and spreed?
[2:18:57] <+Qsmash_> Those shots missing was part of Wesker's plan

[2:21:16] <$lotharrio> He's not planning to live his old life. He's going to be a giant tentacle flesh beast and his organization is going to wipe out most of mankind while leaving the rest as monsters.
[2:21:16] <%legendscar01> Is Irving a nipple or what
[2:21:16] <sadolerlaqreet1> He could just cut himself out of the fish

[2:22:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I do like Irving monster design. i just wish it wasn't like him as a tongue controlling it. Cause Irving is a worthless character, even by Re standards. I just wish it was the monster alone. And it's one of the very few designs i like in this game, cause i think that RE4 had better monster designs. At least they did gave us some cool looking lickers in this game

[2:23:06] <%Jokobeast> DO THAT GUN LIKE YOUR FRIENDS
[2:23:09] <%lionandfox21> I do wander what dictates the "form" that type 2 plagas will undergo for each host? Like the future enemies have some semblance of movement and shape that references to their biomass source, but what the fuck prompted the weird whale thing Irving turned into? Am I too much of a biochemist for this game, am I THINKING TOO HARD?!
[2:23:11] <%DrSoulDraig> do the thing with the other thing
[2:23:13] <+Pat_Squared> he could just capsize the boat probably

[2:24:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> Earthworms are good for soil.
[2:24:22] <Bryon_Youngblood> @PatStaresAt Yeah. Irving didn't think this through. All he cared about was killing Chris and Sheva after Jill had coerced him due to Wesker's orders... and given how Wesker was too arrogant tp deal with Chris himself.
[2:24:23] <sadolerlaqreet1> He can get a TLC show about his fish life

[2:26:00] <%natebud> it's a subclass of machine gun, still a machine gun
[2:26:00] <$lotharrio> Pat's amazing tendency to keep saying the same thing when Paige is confused is frustrating and funny. Frunnystrating.

[2:26:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Die, mostly"
[2:26:52] <dukenux> Irving probably does meth regularly
[2:26:53] <+lethallylactic> Wait couldn't Irving have just bitten through the bottom of the boat and sunk it, then killed them easily?
[2:26:54] <PsychoFlash1> amazing dialogue
[2:26:56] <Bryon_Youngblood> Huh. You know, besides Salazar, Irving's Plagas form looks like something from Monster Hunter.
[2:26:57] <%linSP> exCELLa? like from triCELL?
[2:26:57] <JunkyardCrow> Ha bit his tongue
[2:26:58] <godsblister> first time I fought irving I used all my ammo because fuck him
[2:26:58] <Daxalog> He got a bad batch. In his defense
[2:27:01] <Goldenwolf98> YOUSE
[2:27:02] <$lotharrio> His plan was to be one of the twelve monter-kings of the post apocalypse.
[2:27:02] <dukenux> was it woit it?

[2:27:16] <hntronium> He sounds like the accent Pat used for Lancer
[2:27:16] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt I don't think he "planned" to become a flesh beast, he was told by Excella it was the "good stuff" and "good stuff" usually doesn't entail becoming a flesh beast
[2:27:20] <%Sir_stride> for anyone who wants to play it, RE7 is 20 bucks on the Playstation Store
[2:27:20] <GUNxSPECTRE> Excella Gion is Italian or French?

[2:49:05] <KeiPrime> cross dives are COOL
[2:49:06] <Dhurkst> SHE JUMPED OVER HIM FOR NO REASON
[2:49:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> THEY WOULD HAVE DIED SO BAD
[2:49:08] <icecreamwave> it looks fxxin awesome eh?

[2:49:26] <%코코꾸라> This is really impractical
[2:49:26] <%patriotrenegade> u know what's cool? lasers
[2:49:26] <%alcors_wisdom> chris is built like a brick shit house hed damage the floor before he got hurt
[2:49:28] <%Jokobeast> Dude casually challenges boulders to fist-fights, think he's going to shy away from headbutting the ground?
[2:49:28] <%Monkeyweed21> This temple was designed by idiots
[2:49:29] <%Sir_stride> ah fuck
[2:49:32] <%pectusumbra> I don't remember any of this
[2:49:33] <%Sir_stride> this part
[2:49:33] <%heartlesshealer> Chris ain't protecting his junk from impact. He's not the one who's gonna have babies and continue the bloodline
[2:49:34] <%natebud> This part of the level is the worst
[2:49:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @morcego_cinzento_arts Chris is too roided in this game to carry on the bloodline
[2:49:35] <%worldbrand> more like elabyrinth
[2:49:35] <MyNameIsRasus> This area is so stupid I love it
[2:49:37] <Skelex> With those big muscles, He's given up flexibility, he can't tu ck and roll anymore
[2:49:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh snap
[2:49:38] <%Dementedpenguin> maintenance must suck
[2:49:41] <+mankeyfigh> Okay. is this better or WORSE than the fucking PUZZLE MANSIONS?
[2:49:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> Can I just point out that they hve no idea where they are going, or what these things they're pulling on do.
[2:49:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt The ancient Africans LOVED lasers
[2:49:43] <boomstickery> chris knows he is an usropable slab of meat

[2:49:51] <tactician0> HahaSweat
[2:49:52] <$LocDogX86X> me chris me BIG strong man
[2:49:52] <%legendscar01> would Indy Jones survive tha
[2:49:54] <+necrocannibal2> this is Yaqub's temple
[2:49:56] <Psych_man13_13> Keep Paige AWAY from that grenade launcher
[2:49:57] <%zamzoph> What sort of ancient civilization is even supposed to resemble?
[2:49:58] <%Niney_Who> ""Puzzle""
[2:49:59] <%OwlLightningMage> African alien temples
[2:49:59] <+necrocannibal2> where he created the white men
[2:50:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, nade launcher
[2:50:03] <+tsatoma> @necrocannibal2 LUL
[2:50:03] <%Sir_stride> @goose_attack_almanac welcome to resident evil
[2:50:03] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Did you know the Africans invented the laser?
[2:50:04] <%SilverJakler> For lewds
[2:50:05] <Pwgregory> Remember: shotgun up close, fast gun for far away.
[2:50:06] <%Monkeyweed21> WHO IS MAINTAINING ALL OF THIS
[2:50:11] <+Elemntion> It's boulder Chris
[2:50:11] <%natebud> big waste of time room
[2:50:11] <%cr0wdcontrol> you picked up the RUSTY KEY
[2:50:12] <%OwlLightningMage> Sonic
[2:50:18] <%heartlesshealer> the las plagas maintain the ruins
[2:50:22] <%AdmiralButtloaf> It's the Labyrinth of the Ancients
[2:50:23] <bashful_bard> The sun maintains it
[2:50:29] <%OwlLightningMage> Sonic loves his African laser temples
[2:50:30] <%alcors_wisdom> do u kno da weay
[2:50:30] <tanarath> But did they alsi invent grenade launchers?
[2:50:30] <KeiPrime> mt framework is kind of a miracle of a game engine
[2:50:32] <%heartlesshealer> therefore cultural destruction is liberation from the evil
[2:50:32] <+whoguru5> Chat you ever wonder what the building of these places is like "No no frank the death spikes go over THERE come on man"
[2:50:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> Hall wuggin'.
[2:50:37] <blink289> I think elmo needs more pets
[2:50:41] <%tank7013> @Monkeyweed21 The... zombie tribals? Maybe?
[2:50:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no joke, the temple and the village are my favorite parts
[2:50:45] <%KeystoneA1> @Monkeyweed21 Lore wise the Mashland Majini did, then they got infected and went native. For reasons.
[2:50:49] <%angel949> would be better without the green filter
[2:50:55] <%Neo_Kaiser> Look, if a zombie outbreak were to occur in Africa...
[2:51:04] <%cr0wdcontrol> heahy
[2:51:08] <%Dragon_Batman> They all gotta go/
[2:51:10] <$lotharrio> "Hello." "Know what I mean?" "Drop your shield!" "Paige, the menu, Paige."
[2:51:11] <%heartlesshealer> oh cool, an actual lore reason
[2:51:11] <%Dragon_Batman> ? *
[2:51:11] <Psych_man13_13> Hot take, i think the piss filter is fine
[2:51:13] <bashful_bard> The temple and village are the best levels so don't feel bad
[2:51:13] <trianglehat> thicc nothin
[2:51:21] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Sphincter_Spelunker So even if he wasn't denser then an shone hero protagonist. All the steroids fucked up his balls. Man i guess Leon is the only one able to carry the Redfield lineage
[2:51:21] <%legendscar01> @patstaresat isn't this the place where Spencer finds the proginator virus?
[2:51:26] <%aeravon> Despite all the jokes and whatnot, you two make a great team. It's heartwarming to see.
[2:51:27] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpRtsd4
[2:51:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate it
[2:51:29] <%Sir_stride> piss filter gives it character
[2:51:29] <+whoguru5> i do have a soft spot for RE5 mostly because my first run of the game was with my dad
[2:51:29] <%wolfofsound> pat prefers the piss
[2:51:32] <%Neo_Kaiser> So how come nobody complained in RE6 when Leon had to shoot all the Asians?
[2:51:34] <%Dragon_Batman> I can take it or leave it
[2:51:39] <DrkJP520> Looks so generic without the filter
[2:51:40] <%alcors_wisdom> the first deus ex like game
[2:51:41] <Aydarkzero> it's alright
[2:51:44] <KeiPrime> if your piss is GREEN, SEE A DOCTOR
[2:51:44] <peachy996> Piss Filter doesn't make you think it's a good game
[2:51:46] <%natebud> I don't understand people who want this game to look like a tropical vacation
[2:51:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat loves things covered in piss
[2:51:51] <+whoguru5> Bakoom
[2:51:56] <+necrocannibal2> give it to Paige
[2:51:56] <peachy996> It knows it sucks ass or drinks piss rather
[2:51:56] <%heartlesshealer> bye ammo
[2:52:00] <tanarath> THEY DID
[2:52:00] <%cr0wdcontrol> if you piss blood YOURE FINE
[2:52:01] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt give it to Paige
[2:52:08] <GUNxSPECTRE> Give it to Sheva
[2:52:12] <%AdmiralButtloaf> but thats a girl weapon
[2:52:13] <tanarath> THEY INVENTED GRENADE LAUNCHERS
[2:52:14] <GUNxSPECTRE> No
[2:52:16] <peachy996> RE5 is the most fun Bad Resident Evil game
[2:52:16] <Dhurkst> BIG AND STRONG
[2:52:16] <%RueOrin> Ah yes, the grenade launcher in the ancient underground cavern
[2:52:16] <%jobbedbone> the asians deserved it more for the bat soup stuff
[2:52:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> Pat, y'know you can restart the checkpoint and hoard items in organization right?
[2:52:17] <bashful_bard> load that bitch with flash rounds asap
[2:52:17] <%AdmiralButtloaf> only for girls
[2:52:17] <sonofrobin73> @Neo_Kaiser Because social justice doesn't make any sense
[2:52:17] <%Sausious> Pat DO take all the good guns
[2:52:18] <WaiL_FiN> @Neo_Kaiser because Capcpom is asian, they can do that and it's okay
[2:52:19] <%코코꾸라> psaBougie Ah yes, the Grenade Launcher, a RE staple psaBougie
[2:52:20] <GUNxSPECTRE> But Girls get Explosives
[2:52:22] <%Sausious> SHE ISN'T USING IT THO
[2:52:22] <%Sir_stride> @neo_kaiser because racism against black people has been more pronounced than racism against Asian people
[2:52:24] <mandalor89> the shotgun that is never used
[2:52:25] <%rytisone> how will she open pots then?
[2:52:26] <%KeystoneA1> giving Paige explosive ordinance isn't a good idea tbh
[2:52:29] <%Dragon_Batman> You mean the Rotten egg
[2:52:30] <%legendscar01> that she never uses!
[2:52:31] <%G_Thunders> Didn’t RE6 take place in like 5 different countries around the world?
[2:52:40] <%patriotrenegade> LISTEN....
[2:52:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Neo_Kaiser Cause it only counts against black people. at least as far as videogame bs articles are concerned. While i just remember TJ storm "just play the game!"
[2:52:43] <Pwgregory> The best weapon in the game needs to be fired.
[2:52:44] <Psych_man13_13> the best weapon, that she refuses to ues
[2:52:46] <%Wallabri> imPOTssible
[2:52:46] <%tank7013> @Neo_Kaiser To be fair in RE6 you weren't shooting kung-fu zombies with fumanchus
[2:52:48] <GUNxSPECTRE> Sheva gets a explosive damage boost
[2:52:51] <MicrotonalMatt> Give that Paige a cannon. Paiges love cannons
[2:52:52] <%OwlLightningMage> That she never uses LUL
[2:52:52] <TomFrank> I wish i had friends to play RE5 with FeelsBadMan
[2:52:55] <Speccu_> @G_Thunders yes and it still looked generic as fuck
[2:52:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Neo_Kaiser they were modern asians
[2:52:56] <$lotharrio> @Neo_Kaiser Were they portrayed as green skinned demon people, like old comics?
[2:52:58] <KeiPrime> re6 is what, china, usa, eastern europe?
[2:53:01] <%natebud> RE6 was like Russia, China, and the U.S.
[2:53:06] <KeiPrime> oh and antarctica or somethin
[2:53:07] <%SolverCODO> GOBLINS
[2:53:07] <%Sausious> YOU HAVE SO MUCH AMMO
[2:53:08] <%patriotrenegade> YOU HAVE 60 AMMO
[2:53:09] <%alcors_wisdom> you have SO much ammo
[2:53:15] <KeiPrime> the undersea base at the end of chris campaign

[2:53:21] <KaseKaizer> MYAAA
[2:53:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> Wasn't RE6 East-Europe?

[2:54:31] <%DrSoulDraig> tomb raiders
[2:54:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @PatStaresAt i think that the only ammo types that aren't given by how much they are used, are the grenade rounds and magnum rounds. But you can buy the grenade rounds
[2:54:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Then China I believe
[2:54:40] <%cr0wdcontrol> Pilfer ancient African artifacts
[2:54:40] <%Wallabri> you're pat? ......i'm pat

[2:54:58] <Psych_man13_13> TREASURE BEHIND
[2:54:58] <awalr> ancient indiana jones ruins with nonsensical intricate stone machinery are the best
[2:55:01] <%natebud> All the zombies were wearing adidas track pants so you knew it was Russia @Dragon_Batman
[2:55:03] <%cr0wdcontrol> everyone is pat
[2:55:05] <comicalmond9135> ginger experience requiem
[2:55:05] <%Niney_Who> Every one of those Pull statues has treasure under them
[2:55:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> excellent work, Pat and Pat
[2:55:09] <%Sir_stride> @trekkie11041 these have weaker, right?
[2:55:14] <%Dragon_Batman> @natebud Good point
[2:55:18] <Psych_man13_13> THERE ARE GEMS IN THE STATUES PAT
[2:55:18] <@commanderclaw> Good ol colonialism Sim
[2:55:19] <filialpails> BLOOD DIAMONDS
[2:55:19] <%Mr_Turley> is this the rainforest cafe breakroom?
[2:55:22] <%angel949> the family jewels
[2:55:25] <daemos123> white colonists
[2:55:26] <Quikanims> OOGA BOOGAH
[2:55:30] <%legendscar01> Spears against machine guns yeahh
[2:55:31] <daemos123> plus a token black lady
[2:55:31] <mMayrro> infinite africaners
[2:55:32] <+OhioNitsud> !uptime
[2:55:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 55m.
[2:55:33] <%miguelrod777> destroying ancient arhciture
[2:55:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is Paige just like Will Ferrel in the Other Guys? It's more practical to take her gun away and give her a dummy one?
[2:55:40] <KeiPrime> the idea behind j'avo adapting mutations was kinda neat, but not implemented well
[2:55:40] <Psych_man13_13> right back to the machine gun
[2:55:41] <%코코꾸라> TWIST THEIR DICKS
[2:55:47] <%cr0wdcontrol> Stamper noooooo
[2:55:48] <+necrocannibal2> @legendscar01 kinda worked for the zulus
[2:55:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> I wish all these guys were giant crickets with machine guns
[2:55:53] <GUNxSPECTRE> The fact that they're wearing grass-skirts is so fucked up
[2:55:56] <+Solutha> is there a reason theres bunch of tribal dudes
[2:56:01] <Psych_man13_13> memory of a goldfish
[2:56:05] <KeiPrime> like shootin their legs mutates that shit to be more powerful but grasshopper legs is not what i expected
[2:56:20] <%heartlesshealer> and yet explosions are still existing
[2:56:23] <bashful_bard> The plagas makes them resort to instincts I think
[2:56:24] <$lotharrio> Type-2 plagas are so dangerous because the racism makes you uncomfortable.
[2:56:24] <%legendscar01> @necrocannibal2 if their well trained which I doubt here
[2:56:24] <daemos123> because parts of africa are actually this fucked up and tribal
[2:56:26] <Quikanims> this is Justin Trudeau's favorite part of the game
[2:56:29] <%trekkie11041> @Sir_stride this is 4-1 and it has a ton of treasure including one of the 10000 gems. 5-3 is the one with wesker that has the other 10000 plus the licker gems
[2:56:30] <%tank7013> @Solutha The parasite made them dress up like that. No really
[2:56:36] <%Neo_Kaiser> I wish the explosion barrels in RE5 exploded like they do in RE6.
[2:56:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> well yeah
[2:56:56] <Dhurkst> knife > boot
[2:56:59] <%natebud> same witht he knife
[2:57:05] <%Dragon_Batman> Shotgun-chan really gathering dust
[2:57:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> But what if it was a knife boot
[2:57:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> chris needs boot knife
[2:57:12] <%Monkeyweed21> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[2:57:12] <%legendscar01> well the knife goes through the heart
[2:57:13] <KeiPrime> need some isaac clarke level stomps to compete with that
[2:57:15] <+timmc916> we must build a KNIFE BOOT
[2:57:15] <GUNxSPECTRE> Chris' knife is a fucking machete tho'
[2:57:18] <Hydrapissed> maybe because chris punch do more then hers
[2:57:20] <Hydrapissed> idk
[2:57:27] <Aydarkzero> Resident Evil needs a knife wrench tbh
[2:57:28] <daemos123> funny part about the tribal africans is they're actually very smart when it comes to cameras and microphones, because all of the documentaries filmed on location there
[2:57:28] <%Neo_Kaiser> Split the party
[2:57:32] <%srkAres> 69 bullets. nice.
[2:57:33] <+OhioNitsud> boot knife would be like triple damage
[2:57:36] <Sunstalker> I wish Dead Space 3 was so bad, so they could co-op it
[2:57:40] <%cr0wdcontrol> RE needs a keyring
[2:57:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> The virgin Boot Knife vs the Chad Knife Boot
[2:57:41] <Sunstalker> *wasn't
[2:57:53] <+timmc916> Knife Slorb
[2:57:55] <%Neo_Kaiser> I wish Dead Space 3 existed instead of ending the franchise at 2.
[2:58:01] <alexandrecau> so did the virus kicked in during a festival or it makes you dress as your ancestor tribe
[2:58:15] <+D00msDayDan> @alexandrecau the latter
[2:58:24] <Zombrocom> The virus makes you dress like your ancestors. For some reason.
[2:58:24] <%legendscar01> where's Brad big dick Vickers?
[2:58:29] <SoySocks> SLORB
[2:58:29] <+necrocannibal2> @daemos123 pretty much everyone in Africa has a cellphone, including those guys. in Kenya the most popular form of payment for anything is through a cellphone service.
[2:58:29] <Aydarkzero> ded
[2:58:30] <%hahaha1171> hot
[2:58:30] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea they regress in evolution kinda
[2:58:31] <%SirGO0SE> 200 iq
[2:58:32] <daemos123> they were extras from the zulu remake who got infected
[2:58:33] <trianglehat> aww
[2:58:35] <Dhurkst> @alexandrecau the 2nd
[2:58:36] <%majima666> i wish there was a metal gear solid 4 and 5
[2:58:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Porb
[2:58:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ha, pat is round
[2:58:37] <%Skeleton_Sama> Skeleton_Sama subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Pat do you think mind goblins are curable?
[2:58:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @alexandrecau It canocially makes them dress up as their ancestors. Seriously, there's a note
[2:58:45] <+necrocannibal2> to be fair, Las Plagas made the Spaniards wear armor and shit
[2:58:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> I get it. It's because Pat's round like an orb.
[2:58:46] <%cr0wdcontrol> MercyWing1 VoteYea MercyWing2
[2:58:50] <+necrocannibal2> so it's not a huge leap
[2:58:52] <%Owkono> slorb
[2:58:54] <%ForlornCarton> Yellow
[2:58:56] <tigerfang86> ORB
[2:59:01] <%majima666> mgs1-3 were such epic games. such a shame it ended there
[2:59:02] <tigerfang86> cause pats an ORB get it guys
[2:59:06] <%jorniev> pat is a red orb
[2:59:07] <%heartlesshealer> ???
[2:59:12] <%ForlornCarton> You need to pull the yellow one
[2:59:13] <%trekkie11041> DOWN
[2:59:14] <%Dragon_Batman> There is one under it I think
[2:59:15] <%jorniev> PAT IS A RORB
[2:59:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @necrocannibal2 I always assumed that was Saddler and Salazar
[2:59:22] <Dhurkst> @necrocannibal2 Yeah, that part with conquistador ganados was dope
[2:59:23] <sadolerlaqreet1> @th3smartalec are they using tradition to cope or the brain worms like stereotypes
[2:59:25] <PsychoFlash1> I wonder why they never released a dmc2 and instead jumped from 1 to 3
[2:59:27] <KeiPrime> i wish they made a final fantasy 13 instead of skipping a number
[2:59:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @alexandrecau there is a file in the village in the marshlands taht reveal that the men infected by the las plaguas in the tribe started to dorn the same type of clothes and masks that thier ancestors did
[2:59:28] <daemos123> @majima666 MGS4 is great and you suck at life
[2:59:32] <%Neo_Kaiser> Man, I really wish they made Halo 4. A shame they ended the franchise at Reach.
[2:59:41] <SulfurousAcid> Because
[2:59:47] <trianglehat> lettuce
[2:59:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @sadolerlaqreet1 Uhh... I don't think it clarifies
[3:00:00] <bashful_bard> Pat the loot
[3:00:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> gems under statues @PatStaresAt after you pull thingies
[3:00:03] <%heartlesshealer> puddle of cat
[3:00:03] <%wrightlight94> Don't forget the treasure
[3:00:04] <tigerfang86> he STRECH
[3:00:05] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> why was the temple built this way? Who lived/worked here?
[3:00:07] <%rooooooooooot> did pat say if hes gonna do 7 or not
[3:00:09] <%natebud> I think the idea is that it makes people more violent, so they put on war paint and picked up spears because thats the weapons they had.
[3:00:12] <PsychoFlash1> I wonder why they made assassins creed 1, 2, skipped to 4 and then never touched the franchise again
[3:00:13] <tanarath> Bayby
[3:00:13] <%cr0wdcontrol> psaCrazyhand psaElmo
[3:00:14] <%legendscar01> half life 3 confirmed
[3:00:16] <WaiL_FiN> I'm glad they stopped Fallout at New Vegas.
[3:00:18] <Dhurkst> @majima666 MGS4 was a mess, but a mess in the best way
[3:00:28] <tanarath> Pet him
[3:00:34] <+necrocannibal2> @Jack_of_No_Trades unknown ancient civilization
[3:00:39] <%natebud> MGS4 did some stuff right.
[3:00:39] <%tiaramaki> Man, FFX was a great game, I wish they made a sequel
[3:00:44] <%heartlesshealer> SPODERS
[3:00:48] <alliudmla> Man, i'm so glad the RE franchise doesn't have remakes. Great that they're remaining creative
[3:00:48] <KeiPrime> i cant believe disney bought star wars to only make one movie
[3:00:48] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @necrocannibal2 fair enough
[3:00:52] <%Dragon_Batman> Get em
[3:00:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what's a quick turn?
[3:00:57] <daemos123> kill spiders with knife
[3:00:57] <%majima666> if mgs4 had another act like 1 and 2's gameplay wise i'd like it a lot more
[3:00:58] <%heartlesshealer> Time released spiders
[3:00:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @tiaramaki And on a beach
[3:01:04] <%majima666> it falls off a cliff after act 2
[3:01:07] <%Skeleton_Sama> You know what I just realized, pat's webcam border is the league minimap border.
[3:01:09] <Dhurkst> @majima666 agreed
[3:01:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I'm glad that Legacy of Kain had an conclusion to the Defiance story and didn't any shape or form ended with their last game being a failed multiplayer
[3:01:13] <%Dragon_Batman> Eeeeey Shotgun-chan lives
[3:01:18] <%Sausious> she quick turned to run away. then DIDN'T quickjturn when trying to fight
[3:01:19] <PsychoFlash1> I wonder where all the other 71 fallouts went between 4 and 76
[3:01:20] <trianglehat> you can do it Paige
[3:01:39] <bashful_bard> Russia probably
[3:01:39] <+necrocannibal2> the "ancient civilization" myths started after European found complex structures in Africa and thought there was no way Africans built them
[3:01:53] <Dhurkst> @majima666 though the Europe segment had potential if they bothered to do more with the massive map, and I enjoyed the Shadow Moses callback
[3:01:55] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[3:01:55] <%KeystoneA1> doods
[3:01:57] <SulfurousAcid> LUL
[3:01:59] <%xUmbraNinja> If ONLY this game had a quick turn feature
[3:01:59] <+Dr_Mooose> the doods
[3:02:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> Also the bullshit that "ancient astronauts" believe
[3:02:04] <%DrSoulDraig> shoot dog
[3:02:06] <%Dragon_Batman> doodDood
[3:02:07] <%코코꾸라> SHE LOOTING
[3:02:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> oh my God...she's using the shotgun!!!! YES!
[3:02:12] <%gruff_gridof> doodDood doodDood doodDood doodDood
[3:02:12] <%natebud> I didn't mind act 3 of MGS4, kind of liked the noire theme it was going for.
[3:02:13] <+necrocannibal2> @GUNxSPECTRE true
[3:02:15] <daemos123> the proto africans were pretty cool before their civilizations collapsed
[3:02:15] <%heartlesshealer> time for puzzle
[3:02:17] <MassConnect> you mean what they also did in Asia?
[3:02:20] <PsychoFlash1> but the pyramids tho, how were they made?
[3:02:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @GUNxSPECTRE my mom loves the History channel
[3:02:34] <captnbellybutton> she did it
[3:02:36] <%alcors_wisdom> except for in any other game
[3:02:37] <Dhurkst> @alliudmla Honestly, the remakes are always creative. They always do new & interesting stuff.
[3:02:38] <+necrocannibal2> I'm a compulsive reloader too
[3:02:43] <KeiPrime> push the rope
[3:02:46] <+gwanzan> same
[3:02:47] <+bubbli97> magazine not full=reload
[3:02:49] <mass1997> How much left till the end of the game?
[3:02:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> doodDood doodDood doodDood
[3:02:52] <$lotharrio> Always compulsively reload. There's no reason not to, and it might save you a hit.
[3:02:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> Games should be programmed so that when you reload you lose all unspent ammo within the clip.
[3:02:58] <+OhioNitsud> shoot one round, reload
[3:03:06] <bashful_bard> Like 10 hours to the end
[3:03:16] <%MalekDracarus> -640
[3:03:17] <%코코꾸라> Imagine living on this temple
[3:03:19] <daemos123> Black from ps2 had that feature
[3:03:22] <$Dakuu75> Pull it! Bop it! Twist it!
[3:03:23] <%patriotrenegade> LASERS??
[3:03:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Do that in the army, no one will get mad at you!
[3:03:29] <%코코꾸라> And having to pull the levers this many times to go buy bread
[3:03:29] <PsychoFlash1> @Neo_Kaiser I think that happens in some games, I may be wrong but I believe that's the case in Arma or some other simulator-like game
[3:03:31] <daemos123> if you reloaded without using all your ammo you lost those bullets
[3:03:32] <%코코꾸라> what the fuck
[3:03:33] <+necrocannibal2> @daemos123 great game
[3:03:38] <%majima666> i never played black.....looked hype as SHIT though
[3:03:39] <+Skelegroove> I saw a snippet from a history channel show saying a lake disappeared after russians infected it with bio weapons
[3:03:40] <Dhurkst> @majima666 and the REX segment & fight with Liquid were great
[3:03:40] <%ForlornCarton> also jem at yellow statue
[3:03:48] <%alcors_wisdom> just like how pat drowns in puss amiright
[3:03:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Excited for Ruby Weapon Pat?
[3:03:53] <%Hammerknife> Hammerknife subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! It's nice to see francophile streams getting more traction on twitch - Vive le Québec libre!
[3:03:55] <%natebud> @Neo_Kaiser games have done that and it's always been pretty bad. What's better is when you just save half a magazine for a later reload.
[3:04:03] <bettysharkface> Thanks for the LuvOops @hammerknife
[3:04:04] <%SirGO0SE> hi im pat
[3:04:06] <%majima666> yeah, ill give the ray/rex fight and final fight a pass
[3:04:06] <peachy996> Who's Pat?
[3:04:07] <+botchdogg> @joohyunisbae Still easier to navigy then the rpd
[3:04:11] <%Dragon_Batman> That used to get me too
[3:04:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> did I hear Pat say they were going to be drowning in gash?
[3:04:15] <+necrocannibal2> !uptime
[3:04:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 4m.
[3:04:15] <GUNxSPECTRE> RE would have to NERF enemies like crazy if realistic reloading were to be a thing
[3:04:16] <+botchdogg> navigate
[3:04:19] <$lotharrio> Working at Umbrella is pretty good. But you always gotta find the spider key to get into the bathroom, and your boss is always hiding that shit in statues.
[3:04:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is it Bat Country, round two time?
[3:04:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I was gonna ask Where's Elmo, but then I see his butt just of camera
[3:04:30] <%natebud> @GUNxSPECTRE not the shotgun

[3:05:01] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt just pretend they're women, Paige
[3:05:05] <awalr> I like how Receiver lets you do all kinds of dumb shit since you have to juggle magazines and ammo manually
[3:05:12] <%코코꾸라> @botchdogg Old RPD was crazy, new RPD is way better
[3:05:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Bat(Vergil) 2 let's go

[3:10:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> This game was supposed to have a merchant, but they got cut
[3:10:06] <%natebud> the RE5 merchant doesn't speak much
[3:10:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> selling it to the drebins
[3:10:06] <%Dragon_Batman> Video games
[3:10:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> Merchant: "WELCOME!!!'
[3:10:09] <tanarath> Monstano?
[3:10:12] <cherubs_anonymous> Douglas is really good, a shame he's such a tool in real life
[3:10:16] <%Agami23> isnt there a merchant model in the game that is never used?
[3:10:16] <Shaotanzhiten> They belong in a museum
[3:10:17] <Graxe_> Rotten eggs one-shot most normal enemies, if I remember right

[3:10:23] <bashful_bard> Pat make sure to buy more flash rounds
[3:10:26] <$lotharrio> You're selling it to the townspeople. You kill their neighbors, steal with heritage treasures and then sell them back.
[3:10:29] <%D3rrtyD4n> war economy
[3:10:29] <+axellogic> Selling to the BSAA so they can sell it on the black market
[3:10:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @wolfofsound She had her up in a bun like that once. If only I could find it again
[3:10:30] <Graxe_> But eggs have odd trajectories because they're not grenades
[3:10:33] <42nfl19> is there treasure combining in this game like in RE4?
[3:10:33] <%Ran196> you are selling it to the British Museum
[3:10:36] <%hahaha1171> wow
[3:10:36] <GUNxSPECTRE> Those gems are going to the Caimin Islands to be stored in off-shore accounts
[3:10:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Remember folks. we were supposed to have an actual merchant in RE5 and they decide to cut it....let that sink in and make you sad

[3:11:26] <KeiPrime> aoe stun is pretty good too
[3:11:30] <Psych_man13_13> freeze rounds are fun
[3:11:30] <42nfl19> Doesn't the stun rod also do a shit ton of damage to the plagas? @PatStaresAt
[3:11:32] <bashful_bard> The stick doesn't have infinite range

[3:59:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good job Paige
[3:59:36] <DandyMackeroos> So, I guess Sheva’s hitbox too thick
[3:59:37] <TheHeroAppears> pat trapped himself
[3:59:40] <TheHeroAppears> what a dummy
[3:59:40] <Graxe_> So go re-figure it out

[3:59:43] <%DracaenaLeaf> What's a duck
[3:59:45] <bashful_bard> You can strafe in this game so she just walked into it

[4:00:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is pretty dumb lol

[4:00:37] <%Sir_stride> sure
[4:00:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> It was totally your fault
[4:00:40] <%Neo_Kaiser> Why couldn't Chris just crawl under the lasrr?
[4:00:42] <JanusII> She REALLY didn't.

[4:01:55] <+antdang> What was Umbrella doing here?
[4:01:56] <Azathotic> @42nfl19 The flowers have something on/in them that let Spencer make ALL the zombozo viruses
[4:02:01] <+antdang> I dunno. Maybe it rained.
[4:02:04] <%linSP> but also the erbs
[4:02:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its the Progenitor!
[4:02:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its the bat soup of resident evil
[4:02:14] <DandyMackeroos> Is it because this is a pretty lame explanation?
[4:02:16] <geckko12> it all started here
[4:02:17] <thelonechris> "Oh hey, it's the thing that started all this bullshit in the first place. Neat."
[4:02:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> doink
[4:02:22] <boomstickery> so this is ground zero for the t and all the other viruses

[4:02:37] <cant_pick_a_name> there's no time
[4:02:37] <Djinnazz> that stuffs like 60 years old
[4:02:39] <peachy996> They probably don't
[4:02:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Remember when RE0 tried to expand on the origins of the T virus and the Mansion incident? yeah let's do it for the progenitor virus in RE5
[4:02:40] <%alcors_wisdom> it actually wouldnt matter at this point
[4:02:40] <%D3rrtyD4n> fertile with eggs
[4:02:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's more than alright
[4:02:40] <TheHeroAppears> did chris put some of those flowers into his protein shakes?
[4:02:41] <GUNxSPECTRE> Great, ruin Africa EVEN MORE
[4:02:43] <%Oxybe> UltraKush
[4:02:46] <+SlumberMan> Umbrella was fucking making new life from those plants.
[4:02:47] <%natebud> That really is pretty lame isn't it? A magic flower @DandyMackeroos
[4:02:48] <BlacSoul> EGG
[4:02:48] <42nfl19> "I have many eggs" -Paige on being super fertile
[4:02:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> STARS nuked Africa from orbit after this game.
[4:02:52] <+Jaysky> Give Wesker the EGG.
[4:02:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Why can't they harvest the flowers in a way that would be good, and not horribles zombies?
[4:02:56] <+flexin_apex> raccoon city was the dankest city
[4:02:57] <%NickNackProductions> ripe egg baby
[4:03:00] <$lotharrio> I reviewed the footage. Paige definitely walked into the laser. But it seems like it was her hitbox and not her character model. She was also walking at a weird angle.
[4:03:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Considering Chris is here, the one who was apart of the start of it, there should have been a scene that triggers after reading those files
[4:03:09] <+BubbaRands> The strength of the black panther flows through all of africa
[4:03:10] <%heartlesshealer> throw up that capacity so she can hold more ammo by proxy
[4:03:11] <Dhurkst> @Neo_Kaiser Actually, when you look at how the term/concept originated, that's not far off
[4:03:18] <bashful_bard> Progenitor is what Wesker has so they weren't zombies so much as super soldiers
[4:03:20] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud I think it’s usually better not to explain that kind of stuff
[4:03:22] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt does peaches ever sing any songs by peaches?
[4:03:23] <%코코꾸라> That's SIG
[4:03:30] <%GraceTBM> i dont think you find that handgun???
[4:03:35] <DrkJP520> The handguns only appear in the shop
[4:03:36] <%Sir_stride> no it just shows up in the store
[4:03:37] <%Oxybe> @king_wolf_rigger As if umbrella could do anything and not just "Oops, accidentally zambambies!"
[4:03:51] <tigerfang86> cause he HOT
[4:03:53] <KeiPrime> they are "Partners"
[4:03:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> PARTNERSSSSSS
[4:03:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Because she's hot and cool
[4:03:59] <%GraceTBM> @PatStaresAt SHOOT THE Ceiling
[4:03:59] <%ssjklyco> Because she is his partner
[4:04:01] <DandyMackeroos> Really the fact that they gloss over the origin makes it even worse
[4:04:01] <suikudo> They are fucking up her home
[4:04:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @PatStaresAt Don't worry, unlike the other guns, you don't find them in the main game, only in the store. You didn't miss them
[4:04:02] <%Sir_stride> why not?
[4:04:02] <%Dragon_Batman> She has been designated as a partner and she is loway
[4:04:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Smoke the flowers. Become as Supermans.
[4:04:03] <Samaugsch2> I always knew umbrellas were evil
[4:04:06] <%Dragon_Batman> lyal*
[4:04:07] <%heartlesshealer> hell yeah reading
[4:04:09] <peachy996> She has very little presence
[4:04:12] <%chambatron> The enemy has a residence and are not good
[4:04:16] <%Dragon_Batman> loyal* gah typing
[4:04:16] <+Eddy21forsaken> BIG log
[4:04:16] <trianglehat> big log
[4:04:17] <+Jaysky> They're destroying her home and she wants a good man
[4:04:18] <%ssjklyco> Also, Sheva explained this earlier in the game why she is helping
[4:04:20] <%Sir_stride> Reading-ent evil
[4:04:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Oxybe Fair point
[4:04:21] <BlacSoul> Shes into Josh Kappa
[4:04:21] <DandyMackeroos> Because she thinks Chris is hot?
[4:04:23] <peachy996> This could be a Chris solo game and virtually nothing would change
[4:04:23] <MyNameIsRasus> It's made up
[4:04:24] <%heartlesshealer> I can't type out the phonetics
[4:04:25] <Dhurkst> Because shit's fucked & she's a decent person. You don't need any more motivation than that
[4:04:26] <Pwgregory> Paige wondering why someone would help another person...
[4:04:26] <%Ran196> thats racist Pat
[4:04:28] <%heartlesshealer> but it is pronouncable
[4:04:29] <%GraceTBM> did they get the treasures in the ceiling?
[4:04:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wesker doesn't even know who Sheva is at the end
[4:04:29] <Nekros4442> I'd say Dipaya
[4:04:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> In-de-pa-ya
[4:04:32] <%sporeian94> Just called it The N Word
[4:04:32] <%natebud> @DandyMackeroos Agreed, I always dislike when games feel the need to explain things no one cares about.
[4:04:37] <$lotharrio> N-dipaya
[4:04:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @sporeian94 NOOOO
[4:04:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[4:04:46] <bashful_bard> It would be less fun without co-op
[4:04:50] <+Eddy21forsaken> call it the black evil
[4:04:57] <DandyMackeroos> @dhurkst That’s a good reason as any
[4:05:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> fucking Brandom
[4:05:02] <sharpington_> "we threw the natives out of their own property, which they were squatting in"
[4:05:04] <%majima666> for FUCKS sake brandon
[4:05:08] <%SinisterWang> Brandon's an asshole
[4:05:09] <Samaugsch2> Call it the evil evil
[4:05:16] <%Sir_stride> "fired"
[4:05:19] <sothatsprettybrutal> what is this, a facility for ants???
[4:05:20] <%Sir_stride> more like kill3d
[4:05:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fabiano LUL
[4:05:34] <+Jaysky> Something went wrong.
[4:05:35] <%srkAres> hey thats my birthday
[4:05:45] <Dhurkst> @natebud I'd say quite a few people care about the origin of a zombie virus
[4:05:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> it needs to be at least... THREE times bigger than this
[4:05:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> DANK
[4:05:48] <Pwgregory> Altruism? Huh?
[4:05:48] <+Jaysky> DANK
[4:05:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Christmas '69 nice
[4:05:56] <$serpenttucker> Pumps! Infastructure! Resident Evil.
[4:06:05] <%Neo_Kaiser> Four itchy tasty
[4:06:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why would they call it Progenitor first?
[4:06:14] <%lionandfox21> All these dudes are dead as shit
[4:06:15] <Pwgregory> Are the pumps high heeled or flat?
[4:06:27] <%natebud> @Dhurkst Why? Is them just making a virus not enough? There needs to be some magic flower behind it all?
[4:06:35] <+GenocidalWaluigi> Chris sniffed those flowers to gain big boulder pushing powers
[4:06:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stairway to Heaven
[4:06:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> just like Wakanda
[4:06:40] <bashful_bard> Because it was their Progenitor virus
[4:06:41] <BlacSoul> kill irving
[4:06:42] <%lionandfox21> @Th3SmartAlec Cause its the basal viral component for all following viruses
[4:06:42] <%PanicSwytch> So this retcons the RE0 Slugs?
[4:06:49] <Aydarkzero> WHO?
[4:06:49] <magicmagma196> Thank you for the gameplay!
[4:06:51] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd

[4:06:58] <omega_reddu> Scala ad Caelum

[4:07:00] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud Maybe if they dedicated a whole game to it.
[4:07:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lionandfox21 Right, but why would they call it that BEFORE making those other viruses?

[4:07:20] <CurrySauseBandit> Perspicacious: having a ready insight into and understanding of things.
[4:07:32] <serrule1> Hey Paige! I heard you guys have been watching musicals lately. Any thoughts on Dear Evan Hansen? I have a feeling Pat would hate Evan though >_<

[4:08:09] <%PanicSwytch> CMON
[4:08:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> CMON
[4:08:15] <Dhurkst> @natebud Dude, it's natural to be curious about this kind of stuff. If you aren't that's fine, but most people don't feel the same.
[4:08:15] <Ifrit_13> CMON
[4:08:15] <+Jaysky> CMON!
[4:08:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> are you ok
[4:08:23] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud Honestly, even then I would’ve like the virus origin to be nebulous and mysterious
[4:08:24] <+StrongNico> huuuh

[4:08:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> ze lab
[4:08:51] <Djinnazz> it only works on certain ppl.
[4:08:52] <$serpenttucker> They probably needed a way to mass produce it
[4:08:53] <defaultname3887> Likers
[4:08:57] <Hellarussian> CRAZY TALK
[4:08:58] <%natebud> @DandyMackeroos I don't think this game needs any prequels after what RE0 looked like. having them just have made a virus is good enough.
[4:08:59] <+necrocannibal2> it worked on Wesker
[4:08:59] <%Dragon_Batman> Not yet
[4:09:00] <Shadope342> why isn't there a dumb optional game over button prompt to snack on the flowers
[4:09:01] <%chaumiester> Wow, Resident Evil is stupid
[4:09:05] <$lotharrio> Well the T-Veronica virus seems like an upgrade.
[4:09:07] <peachy996> Guns and reapers
[4:09:11] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt how goes the RE5? I just gone done streaming some Indigo Prophecy. Holy shit the game i just... argh. ARRGH.
[4:09:13] <BlacSoul> KUREJI TAKU'
[4:09:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> the end
[4:09:18] <%Sir_stride> technically, only a couple people could consume the flower. it would kill those who didnt have the correct genes
[4:09:19] <%Oxybe> @shadope342 That would be fntastic
[4:09:22] <sothatsprettybrutal> these flowers are the key to my new business that will transform the world, I call it Juicero

[4:10:00] <Pwgregory> Who would buy these viruses? A couple of hillbillies with shotguns can take them down.
[4:10:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It's amazing how before it was "Umbrella conducts life violating experiemnts to create bio weapons to get richer then Arabic royalty" And over time it was retconed to be "Umbrella conducts life violating experiments to become demigods or some ultimate life form bs"
[4:10:02] <%Neo_Kaiser> Nah, they revealed in this game it was just to create eternal life.
[4:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> WAIT WHAT ABOUT PLANT 42

[4:10:13] <%heartlesshealer> She told you about the eggs, pat
[4:10:14] <%lionandfox21> Pat you're forgetting the weirdly obsessed assistant researcher who fucking lives in this area for nearly 50 years

[4:10:17] <%natebud> @Dhurkst It's not even that you can't be curious, it's just adding a less interesting answer to a question that's pretty much been answered. Where did the virus come from? They made it in a lab
[4:10:17] <trianglehat> she's ovulating
[4:10:19] <Hellarussian> have an egg in this trying time

[4:13:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Every time i looked at those caged animals all i could think of is that they will die slowly from dehydration. so i just shot them
[4:13:08] <+Eddy21forsaken> good job paige
[4:13:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> INOTHING PAT
[4:13:09] <BlacSoul> NOTHING
[4:13:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah, Baige
[4:13:10] <%heartlesshealer> lion hear licker
[4:13:10] <%tank7013> Shooting those animals would probably be the right thing to do honestly. They've gotta be suffering right now from hunger at the very least
[4:13:12] <%D3rrtyD4n> paige saved the day
[4:13:12] <%Neo_Kaiser> There's an instant death QTE you can perform
[4:13:12] <%the_vedo_show> just a little atpCap
[4:13:12] <%Laecerelius> Shoot butt!
[4:13:14] <Psych_man13_13> Can’t wait for acid rounds
[4:13:19] <%Niney_Who> These are BETA Lickers, not Alpha-Lickers which are in RE2
[4:13:20] <%Agami23> yet smaller than remake
[4:13:21] <%RowenCleric> OH BOY!
[4:13:22] <+lethallylactic> But somehow less intimidating.
[4:13:23] <%MoralCompassGaming> Licky-Licky monster, goti t.
[4:13:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fat lickers
[4:13:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> their weak spot is their chest, Pat
[4:13:29] <%chhdez> Ha ha, king pow
[4:13:30] <%D3rrtyD4n> THAT LOOKS DUMB LUL
[4:13:31] <RadShiro> i dont remember Lickers being in this game AT ALL
[4:13:32] <$serpenttucker> corpse (nothing)
[4:13:33] <$lotharrio> Lickers are strong against living things.
[4:13:34] <+Remery_> go back to pet the goats and giant rats
[4:13:36] <OkamiDude15> 🅱️ eta lickers
[4:13:37] <bashful_bard> Try to melee one on its back Pat
[4:13:38] <%lionandfox21> Cause they've been modified and are now called Beta lickers
[4:13:41] <+lethallylactic> RE5 Lickers are like little doggos
[4:13:42] <%trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt which is funny because theyre massive in remake 2
[4:13:43] <Aydarkzero> i LOVE that turning animation

[4:14:01] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap
[4:14:02] <%tiaramaki> Rherb!
[4:14:07] <%Neo_Kaiser> Lickers aren't their official name
[4:14:08] <%alcors_wisdom> ak
[4:14:08] <%Estuko> @lionandfox21 so are the prior ones from like, RE2 or so are the Chad Lickers?
[4:14:09] <OkamiDude15> is paige singing a song from rent?
[4:14:10] <%BioHunter> ur too much paige Kappa
[4:14:11] <%majima666> aks74-u
[4:14:12] <s1rcuit> what brought up the whole Meister subject?
[4:14:18] <+ThunderZebraKing> Ah RE5, what people assumed was the worst resident evil until 6 happened B)
[4:14:22] <%Niney_Who> What's better, the AK or UMP5?
[4:14:22] <%heartlesshealer> songs
[4:14:22] <%trekkie11041> SAFE IN ROOM
[4:14:25] <+lethallylactic> LUL Paige
[4:14:26] <Aydarkzero> whats the official name of the licker then?
[4:14:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also i believe that the reason those lickers look different is cause those were lickers that had been modified. To the point that in their genetic modification they developed the ability to make babies
[4:14:27] <%xUmbraNinja> psaGib
[4:14:28] <%Ner234> SPEEN
[4:14:30] <%D3rrtyD4n> call him a slut again, paige

[4:14:32] <DandyMackeroos> @neo_kaiser They did RE2 REmake in my knowledge
[4:14:32] <%trekkie11041> MISSED MONEY
[4:14:36] <KeiPrime> they're using 556ers with pineapples
[4:14:38] <%Niney_Who> Kappa
[4:14:39] <%lionandfox21> @Neo_Kaiser Yea but the info is relayed back to Umbrella and stuff
[4:14:42] <+Remery_> But Sheva's cute accent saved RE5
[4:14:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> damn it sheva
[4:14:45] <%chaumiester> I'm pretty sure Code Veronica has the title of worse RE.

[4:15:56] <BlacSoul> glaaaaass
[4:15:57] <DandyMackeroos> I think there was once a whole horde of Hunters in RE Rev
[4:15:57] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap
[4:16:00] <%Renuarb> COME ON!!!
[4:16:04] <%natebud> Why did we keep them behind this easily breakable glass?
[4:16:05] <%Atomik456> Atomik456 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! are they using the same stock sounds as dark souls basilisks?
[4:16:05] <%chhdez> Immediatley runs
[4:16:06] <+Remery_> look at that one kicker pressing its dick up against the glass
[4:16:06] <peachy996> The BOW form of Paige
[4:16:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> WutFace
[4:16:07] <Dhurkst> @natebud I never said that, dude. I'm saying that, in general, people like explanations for this kind of stuff. I never said anything about the quality of this explanation, which I'll agree is too simple & convenient in this case.
[4:16:07] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[4:16:08] <DandyMackeroos> Then they got shot with a sun beam
[4:16:08] <TheyCallMeVawn> COWARDS
[4:16:10] <%Kenzo2000> Shoot. The glass
[4:16:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the lever don't piss them off. It's just so that the player is aware that they are in there before they just run in into that run

[4:17:21] <Psych_man13_13> Man, the hypest fight in all of RE is in ORC, where there’s a cutscene where they kill a horde of zombies, lickers, hunters and tyrants
[4:17:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> RE2 Remake Lickers a re way more threatening

[4:20:20] <%wolfofsound> come on baby, let's do the spin
[4:20:24] <Dhurkst> I actually COMPLETELY forgot that lickers are in this game at all. That's how lame they are here.
[4:20:30] <BlacSoul> SeemsGood
[4:20:30] <%valriot> This trash LUL
[4:20:32] <%PanicSwytch> Boss?
[4:20:36] <%Neo_Kaiser> Oh look, a boss fountain
[4:20:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> They already do Wesker?
[4:20:38] <%natebud> @Dhurkst I don't think it's necesarry in this case to offer an explanation even if people are curious. Overexplaining minor details are always going to be underwhelming.
[4:20:38] <%Dragon_Batman> This is gon be something else
[4:20:38] <KeiPrime> you can do exchange items
[4:20:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> god three frag grenades and you will the boss
[4:20:42] <%heartlesshealer> I like that she knows about boss fountains
[4:20:52] <Aydarkzero> if there was even a re2r licker in that hallway they'd be dead
[4:20:53] <%Monkeyweed21> USE GERB
[4:21:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> just restart from the checkpoint and sell it
[4:21:10] <%Neo_Kaiser> Paige is the healer cause she's a woman
[4:21:13] <Frostydough1> Just as G Herbo intended
[4:21:14] <DandyMackeroos> @dhurkst Don’t they only appear in this section and never again?
[4:21:15] <KeiPrime> is this the U2 thing boss?
[4:21:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, this boss.
[4:21:18] <+necrocannibal2> spider boss?
[4:21:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> hate this elevator, good luck aiming
[4:21:22] <%Neo_Kaiser> They appear in a later section

[4:21:48] <$serpenttucker> That's not this part IIRC
[4:21:51] <%heartlesshealer> great
[4:21:52] <Dhurkst> @natebud It's not even over-explaining. The modern equivalent of "a wizard did it" is not an explanation in the first place; it's a thoughtless excuse.
[4:21:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Yeah, it's not like she can be anywhere else!"
[4:21:52] <prophetdisharmonious> Paige has played Bloodborne. She KNOWS when a boss is coming.

[4:26:00] <%natebud> @Dhurkst Adding the flower to the story is like saying a wizard was also on staff at umbrella. It's overexplaining when suspension of disbelief was all that was needed. Adding more detail isn't always better. They made it in a lab.
[4:26:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Remember when Woolie ran all the way to the end of the Armored Spider's tunnel then turned around?

[4:31:38] <Psych_man13_13> Why no acid?
[4:31:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i legit like how the ballistic vest and the melee protection look like on Chris and Sheva's designs
[4:31:43] <%xUmbraNinja> psaWink
[4:31:44] <KeiPrime> oh right the lever operating zombos
[4:31:45] <peachy996> Yeah just ask politely
[4:31:46] <%Hammerknife> a stab vest would be better
[4:31:48] <$lotharrio> For all the bullets that the bug monsters and organ beasts will shoot you with.
[4:31:49] <KeiPrime> this fuckinpart
[4:31:49] <%Conyst> This is gun part

[4:31:54] <%Neo_Kaiser> The vest in RE4 is just a DEF increase vest. Not available in Pro.

[4:31:55] <%SilverJakler> I'm starting to hear the Sonic in Chris' voice

[4:32:05] <DandyMackeroos> Well there are guns being shot at you in RE4 and 5
[4:32:14] <natebud> They made her too white

[4:32:43] <%Dragon_Batman> The gameplay gun shit wasn't too bad in RE6
[4:32:44] <peachy996> Skip to 6 already
[4:32:47] <JanusII> I liked RE6 more... LUL
[4:32:47] <%Neo_Kaiser> In RE6 you can fist fight a chopper
[4:32:48] <%D3rrtyD4n> re6 is fun to control
[4:32:49] <+SlappyMeats> the only genuinely good thing about RE6 is Chris and Piers frolicking on the playground
[4:32:50] <savagedeviljayho> RE6>>the fixed camera games
[4:32:50] <%srkAres> you can dodge... via qte
[4:32:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Is Eggman an Isekai Protagonist
[4:32:51] <%natebud> Jill's translucent now
[4:32:52] <mo0ody2090> RE6 was a good game tho
[4:32:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> re6 overstays it's welcome and won't leave your house
[4:32:55] <Dhurkst> @natebud Yes, the flower is overly convenient, but as I already explained, I'm talking about explanations in general, NOT THIS SPECIFIC ONE. Most people will dismiss the argument of "just suspend your disbelief" by pointing out how this justifies lazy writing & hand-waves. We're talking in fucking circles here.
[4:32:56] <%PanicSwytch> Dodging was shown in the original trailer
[4:33:01] <Pwgregory> No, Sherry and Jake’s UST is he best part of that game.
[4:33:02] <%heartlesshealer> but they have to finish RE5 for black history month

[4:34:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> one thing i do like in those military majinji is that you can shoot of the grenades in their bodies(when they have then) and they just explode

[4:34:35] <+Remery_> when I die I want fly in the air and do a sick spin twist
[4:34:36] <%Conyst> Because it is bad
[4:34:38] <Heyestus> Metal Gear guards notice things though...
[4:34:38] <%Dragon_Batman> The answer being yes
[4:34:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Her vision cone is quite bad
[4:34:46] <%Bt_Robot> GUESS IT WAS NOTHING!
[4:34:47] <%vectorless_peon> Rooty tootie shootie
[4:34:47] <peachy996> This even sounds like a Metal Gear track
[4:34:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> Remember in RE6 when you fly around in a fighter jet for a while?
[4:34:51] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd they just pop up
[4:34:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @TwinBat The Lupus is somehow holding back the FoxDie!
[4:35:00] <Hydrapissed> her vision cone is a vision SLORB
[4:35:03] <%Valdorick> Yeah! Team work!
[4:35:05] <Hellarussian> ACTION ZOMBIE
[4:35:06] <%Dragon_Batman> Sick roll dood
[4:35:10] <%PanicSwytch> Good team work

[4:35:17] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap
[4:35:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Instead of placing Adult Magazines to lure/distract guards. Snake lays down a picture of Papyrus in a suggestive manner
[4:35:20] <Amesa3420> no paige shoots like a storm trooper
[4:35:23] <DandyMackeroos> Oh yeah, now I just need audio of Paige saying “Who’s talking?!” added into a Metal Gear game.
[4:35:29] <%GraceTBM> my first time through I was totally onboard with this game until this fuckin section
[4:35:32] <MassConnect> how not far would paige get in MGS before quit

[4:35:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> remember in RE6 when the one character won't talk to leon and just keeps saying "trust me" for like 3 chapters
[4:35:42] <Triplicat> if only you also had bulletproof vests............
[4:35:50] <+Remery_> just ran in a circle
[4:35:57] <DandyMackeroos> @gracetbm That waist high cover though
[4:36:02] <Hellarussian> if you cant beat em..
[4:36:03] <%Neo_Kaiser> Do the RE Spin!
[4:36:04] <%srkAres> they dont know
[4:36:06] <Bu5hranger> lol
[4:36:07] <%GraceTBM> i feel like Paige could get through MGS1 pretty okay with a little persistence, but not 2 or 3
[4:36:09] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd so backwards
[4:36:09] <%PanicSwytch> I wish they make MGS Twin Snakes for switch
[4:36:10] <$lotharrio> Pat, you'd die instantly from a gun.
[4:36:17] <%Bt_Robot> HEAVY MACHINEGUN
[4:36:18] <%DrFacilier> that would be like Superman using a Kryptonite SWORD
[4:36:21] <MoroseLoki> fooolio
[4:36:25] <bashful_bard> With how little bullets do to you, the vest is fairly pointless outside of pro
[4:36:26] <+SlappyMeats> the makeout closet
[4:36:27] <%GraceTBM> he jumped down
[4:36:27] <%Neo_Kaiser> Or Batman using a GUN
[4:36:32] <%Dragon_Batman> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeaaaaaa, she was purty tho
[4:36:33] <%rasterman> I mean, I'd die from a regular grenade. I'd still use one given the chance
[4:36:35] <+Remery_> give Sheva more eggs to sit on
[4:36:45] <%natebud> @Dhurkst what caused the zombies in Night of the Living Dead? A meteor. L4D? a flu. Walking Dead? a virus. Return of the Living dead? Made in a lab. That's all you need. It's usually a minor detail that doesn't deserve more than a sentence because ultimately what amino acids were detected in a virus doesn't affect the characters or story at all.
[4:36:47] <DrkJP520> That'd be like Chris using guns. oh wait
[4:36:52] <$bootysteve> Good ol' Pooch Sativa
[4:36:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dragon_Batman she reminded me of Sara from CSI

[4:37:05] <KeiPrime> from HEr inventory
[4:37:05] <%Jekado> pistol ammo
[4:37:09] <%GraceTBM> @bashful_bard do the bullets do the same proportional damage on pro, or do they get boosted extra?
[4:37:10] <BlacSoul> Paige had HG Ammo
[4:37:13] <CurrySauseBandit> Handgun ammo
[4:37:16] <BlacSoul> Again
[4:37:21] <peachy996> Moments like this are why I dont like the inventory system
[4:37:21] <%SoFarFetched> @natebud I believe the walking dead creator recently answered a fan question that it was alien spores that caused the zombies.
[4:37:29] <peachy996> And why the attache is better
[4:37:31] <$mighty_max_t> BECKY

[4:39:51] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud Ultimately I suppose the origin of a zombie virus is a foot note to the real story.
[4:39:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> bakana
[4:39:59] <peachy996> Good job Pat
[4:39:59] <capnkrispy> crazy talk
[4:40:00] <suikudo> This is my favorite part
[4:40:02] <KeiPrime> i frames
[4:40:03] <Triplicat> iFRAMES
[4:40:05] <%srkAres> nic ei-frames
[4:40:06] <%SoFarFetched> @natebud I think I vaguely remember that, I've only ever read the comic series though but I never finished it. Believe I stopped around the part where it's about to go into the Time Skip.
[4:40:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> roles have reveresed
[4:40:14] <Triplicat> big, strong paige
[4:40:20] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> GReat teamwork!
[4:40:21] <%natebud> @DandyMackeroos Exactly
[4:40:21] <%SilverJakler> The Alien thing is not the canon cause for the zombie outbreak in TWD. It was an April Fool's joke
[4:40:24] <%GraceTBM> i always prefer in media when the origin of the zombies isn't nearly as important as what to do now that they're here
[4:40:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Ladies and Gentlemen. Now you all know where RE5 just completelly fell apart
[4:40:26] <%Niney_Who> Paige did fine tho
[4:40:26] <%Nina96> bad
[4:40:28] <%KeystoneA1> The rest of the game is shotty bits
[4:40:31] <BlacSoul> PAIGE HAS AMMO
[4:40:31] <KitsuneManami> psaGoblin
[4:40:33] <peachy996> Yeah they suck
[4:40:34] <%SoFarFetched> @natebud but I do wonder if the creator elaborated more on the alien spores in that post.
[4:40:37] <%GraceTBM> NO THERE'S SOME MORE BAD ONES
[4:40:42] <%Jekado> they make the game feel not RE thats for sure
[4:40:43] <BlacSoul> thank you paige
[4:40:44] <dan_g_v> mistress of the i-frames
[4:40:51] <%srkAres> i really liked this part back in the day because i just always took point and let my friend shoot them
[4:40:54] <peachy996> I said before the game falls off a cliff as soon you get in Reuben's jeep
[4:40:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> i remember more bad ones
[4:40:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> the conveyor belts are pretty bad
[4:40:59] <%GraceTBM> like when they're all shooting you from catwalk to catwalk
[4:41:00] <%Dragon_Batman> The conveyer belt one
[4:41:02] <%natebud> @SoFarFetched Someone's saying it was an april fools joke, so who knows?
[4:41:09] <%trekkie11041> FEET
[4:41:09] <BlacSoul> FOOD GOOD
[4:41:11] <%Jekado> smelter area? and conveyor right?
[4:41:11] <CurrySauseBandit> They're a breeze with 2 people usually.
[4:41:13] <+tsatoma> Boros has loaded?
[4:41:13] <Psych_man13_13> I will say, I’m very impressed at Paige’s improvement throughout the stream
[4:41:21] <%GraceTBM> paige is really doing fantastic
[4:41:22] <DandyMackeroos> Paige is getting better
[4:41:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> How are they hearing this

[4:41:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Because it didn't
[4:41:51] <Hellarussian> he has Amnosia
[4:41:52] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt b/c it didn't
[4:41:54] <savagedeviljayho> cause we don't talk about CV
[4:41:55] <+SlappyMeats> because we should all pretend CV didn't happen
[4:41:55] <+TreeeFOX> FEEEEEET
[4:41:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why is Chris pretending there is only one man named Albert
[4:41:57] <critfumble_> we all want to
[4:41:57] <a_mad_dragon> wishful thinking
[4:41:58] <%heartlesshealer> all he can think about is the redfield bloodline

[4:41:59] <+TaylOctopus91> !uptime
[4:42:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 42m.

[4:42:02] <%GarbageNirvana> To be fair everyone is pretending it didn't happen
[4:42:03] <%Niney_Who> Pat to be fair you pretend that Code Veronica doesn't happen either. @PatStaresAt
[4:42:04] <%chaumiester> Because everybody is pretending that Code Veronica didn't happen
[4:42:04] <%natebud> Code Veronica didn't happen. It wasn't important
[4:42:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PatStaresAt Stop tempting us with your feet, Pat!
[4:42:05] <%ForlornCarton> But falling off cliffs with no body means you are dead.
[4:42:05] <%Dragon_Batman> Cuz he got his assed wrecked by Wesker
[4:42:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> CHRIS IS DUMB
[4:42:09] <smugjorgen98> becouse no one wants to think about CVX
[4:42:09] <%D3rrtyD4n> exatly
[4:42:09] <%SoFarFetched> @natebud I mean anything is possible LUL with how many explainations for zombies they have out there.
[4:42:09] <%GraceTBM> chris assumes jill is alive but wesker definitely died
[4:42:10] <KeiPrime> no touch
[4:42:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[4:42:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> exactly
[4:42:13] <DandyMackeroos> Code Veronica didn’t happen
[4:42:13] <%realm_forge> Because it didn’t.....waves hand
[4:42:13] <%GraceTBM> kill them for LOOT
[4:42:15] <GunEden> farm hallway
[4:42:15] <$lotharrio> He assumed that Jill used him as a cushion.
[4:42:18] <Jetsfantasy> Shut up, that's why
[4:42:18] <%Dragon_Batman> This is the money hallway
[4:42:19] <%xUmbraNinja> Because he went out a window off a cliff...?
[4:42:19] <+Dr_Mooose> they hear, then see
[4:42:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You and your whore feet, Patrick.
[4:42:27] <biomegabear> CRAZY TALK
[4:42:27] <alexandrecau> wesker cushioned jill's fall
[4:42:28] <%tiaramaki> But didn't Chris say that Jill was dead near the start?
[4:42:29] <+necrocannibal2> RUN WOMAN
[4:42:33] <hold_dat26> cuz josh showed him the pic
[4:42:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xUmbraNinja But Jill also did, and he assumed Jill was alive
[4:42:34] <+SlappyMeats> kill them for big treasure!
[4:42:35] <%D3rrtyD4n> HE RAN
[4:42:35] <+KennyK> Chris honestly believes that Jill did the greatest suplex known to man on Wesker and just walked away fine
[4:42:35] <%tiaramaki> So he obviously thought she was
[4:42:35] <BlacSoul> she was fine actuall
[4:42:36] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt Jill has airbags to cushion her fall
[4:42:37] <peachy996> Let them all chase Pat

[4:48:14] <ricky12k> @dandymackeroos alright thanks. I remember the hallway being hard without good weapon.
[4:48:16] <DrkJP520> If you spin a zombie around a bunch of times, do you think it'll get dizzy?
[4:48:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Niney_Who You wanna learn to do an infinite?
[4:48:22] <%srkAres> good job, thanks gun
[4:48:22] <+axellogic> why bother sneaking through if you are just going to kill them all
[4:48:26] <dan_g_v> lazy lickers
[4:48:29] <%SolverCODO> freeing each other by shooting them is way more effective
[4:48:31] <JanusII> Yeah, chat, when are they going to realize it's infinite? Kappa
[4:48:32] <bashful_bard> Giving paige the m3 was a good call
[4:48:33] <%GraceTBM> @PatStaresAt there's an instant kill heart stab while they're flipped over
[4:48:42] <KeiPrime> fighting them down a choke point is easier tbf
[4:48:46] <%Sir_stride> you can heal
[4:48:49] <%srkAres> SHE HAS HG AMMO
[4:48:50] <%Jekado> drop the pistol rounds
[4:48:51] <%natebud> This is the place where the .500 magnum becomes a reality
[4:48:52] <%Sir_stride> you dont have ammo
[4:48:52] <%Dragon_Batman> Handgun ammo can go
[4:48:56] <DandyMackeroos> @gracetbm They’re like mini tyrants?
[4:48:58] <%Niney_Who> Give Pat the Grenade??
[4:48:59] <BlacSoul> HG
[4:49:02] <+PhysicsLB> HANDGUN BULLETS
[4:49:02] <%Sir_stride> also handgun ammo
[4:49:05] <peachy996> Give Pat HG ammo
[4:49:05] <%Bt_Robot> GIVE HIM GREBADE
[4:49:07] <DandyMackeroos> Makes sense
[4:49:10] <peachy996> Give Pat
[4:49:11] <%misha_kastrilevich> BAD GUY!
[4:49:11] <Dhurkst> @natebud The entire origin & core of my argument is that it's natural for people to be curious about these details, especially in long-running franchises with fleshed-out worlds & lore like Resident Evil, and no matter what you say, most people are. Your examples are smaller, more self-contained stories, not anything with fleshed-out worlds and lore. I don't know how many times, in how many ways, I need to explain these basic ideas, but idc anymore. I'm done talking to a brick wall. Goodbye.

[4:49:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus that text
[4:49:45] <%Hammerknife> man i wish my RDB could hold 95 rounds
[4:49:46] <KeiPrime> the game is longer than you think
[4:49:48] <%Sir_stride> the weaker room?
[4:49:50] <%Jekado> this room is dummmbbb
[4:49:50] <%ratcan_> oh no
[4:49:52] <Graxe_> Nope, it's this room
[4:49:53] <$lotharrio> It's for burning explosives.
[4:49:54] <%natebud> @Dhurkst I already said it was fine to be curious like 5 comments ago.
[4:49:55] <@commanderclaw> It's the fireworks factory
[4:49:56] <trianglehat> the explosion factory
[4:49:57] <KaseKaizer> this is the explosion factory Paige
[4:50:00] <%KeystoneA1> @PatStaresAt Ready to fight the instakill bugs? They're a comin'
[4:50:01] <peachy996> The explode room
[4:50:07] <%xUmbraNinja> Man this game is worse than I remembered
[4:50:07] <%Sir_stride> Boss well
[4:50:11] <vinceshamwowslap> this room is cool
[4:50:13] <KeiPrime> thers like 5 more " i thought this went to that " areas left in the game ithink
[4:50:14] <bashful_bard> You still got a lot of fuck between you and wesker
[4:50:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Guys WITH GUNS???
[4:50:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud Whats going on? lol
[4:50:25] <suikudo> mini gun fat evil
[4:50:30] <MassConnect> "i don't care" is a straight up lie 100% of the time
[4:50:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> how come they're not dressed up as their ancestors
[4:50:39] <+YakumoYomi> I like to think that Pat and Paige's dialogue is just canonical chatter between Chris and Sheva.
[4:50:44] <bashful_bard> Low supplies
[4:50:45] <ricky12k> Well at least they are prepared.
[4:50:47] <Haxzzer> !uptime
[4:50:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 50m.
[4:50:47] <KeiPrime> their ancestors were mercs
[4:50:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> fair
[4:50:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Sphincter_Spelunker The Las Plagas got past its racism phase I guess
[4:51:01] <$Dakuu75> wow 5 hour stream
[4:51:04] <DandyMackeroos> Get into that cover!
[4:51:07] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL
[4:51:10] <%natebud> @XeroSigmaPrime I said the re5 flower was a dumb explanation for the virus, when "made in a lab" was good enough. It kind of escalated from there
[4:51:10] <peachy996> @YakumoYomi "Chris how do I do the RE Spin?"
[4:51:14] <ricky12k> Just as i said that paige got flash gernaded.
[4:51:18] <ricky12k> Along with pat.
[4:51:26] <%Estuko> I can't tell what's my preference, l4d zombie style, or RE1-2 zombies where an individial zombie can be a severe threat.
[4:51:34] <KeiPrime> he brought the rocket launcher cause he thought this was the boss room but theres still the fucking giant cockroaches
[4:51:38] <DandyMackeroos> @ricky12k Paige got flashed
[4:51:45] <%GraceTBM> paige reloading ALL her guns at a good, safe time? she's doing better than Pat these day
[4:51:53] <ricky12k> @dandymackeroos Not that kind of flash.
[4:51:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I honestly thought the spinning elevator part was next.

[4:52:15] <%Skittlesoul> hey where are we in the game?
[4:52:15] <%Neo_Kaiser> Does Pat know about the Rocket Launcher prep trick?
[4:52:18] <%GraceTBM> i feel like l4d zombies are for a different style of game, where you just shoot like crazy. a different kind of tense
[4:52:20] <peachy996> Spinny Elevator is much later
[4:52:22] <bashful_bard> If 5 handgun bullets is threatening to you I guess they're terrifying zombies
[4:52:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud Oh lol i mean... kinda. Flower is sorta dumb, made in lab is cool but you know whats really dumb? leEChEs THaT aRe seNTIEnT
[4:52:23] <KeiPrime> damn, theres still a decent chunk left aint there
[4:52:33] <%GraceTBM> @Skittlesoul somewhere nearing the end of the third quarter, i think
[4:52:35] <%SinisterWang> Fun's expensive
[4:52:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Considering he has the Rocket , he might know
[4:52:35] <%NWR_James> Pat wants to ahve some fun

[4:52:52] <Samaugsch2> Fun? danSgame
[4:52:57] <+necrocannibal2> just like that Mass Effect door
[4:53:03] <KeiPrime> fun is illegal in the year of our lord 2020

[4:53:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud hahaha according to RE0, thats how they made the Progen into T.... fucking leeches
[4:53:16] <%natebud> @XeroSigmaPrime Don't you want to know what happened to Bravo Team!? I wish I didn't...
[4:53:23] <+bubblebasspickles> this factory layout is sub-optimal
[4:53:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> they fucked leeches?
[4:53:30] <%Dragon_Batman> Were those the guys that just raw explode on death or they have a grenade on them?
[4:53:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Crazy Talk
[4:53:40] <CoxAnbals> get ready for more real grenades
[4:53:40] <DandyMackeroos> Leecherfucker R’ Us
[4:53:42] <peachy996> What rules
[4:53:43] <%GraceTBM> RE4 let the enemies throw grenades
[4:53:45] <%natebud> They just stuffed the leeches with flowers until they were smart
[4:53:46] <%MrDonTacos_> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:53:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> Well, dynamite

[4:53:56] <ricky12k> Hmm? Oh crazy talk. Great.
[4:54:02] <%GraceTBM> i seem to recall the enemies that explode when they die not being super clear that they would
[4:54:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Pat says that after fighting dynamite throwing enemies in this and RE4
[4:54:11] <%Valdorick> Explosive barrel factory, eh?
[4:54:11] <%Neo_Kaiser> Enemies die when they are killed

[4:54:57] <%Oxybe> So this is where red videogame barrels are made
[4:54:58] <ricky12k> So then should someone tell that he needs to protect pagie?
[4:54:59] <peachy996> Dont kill each other
[4:55:00] <%GraceTBM> if you could move while shooting in this game, then RE5 would have been the RE6 of RE4

[4:56:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud And the magic elevator
[4:56:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the deal with the sig 556 is that it has the quickest reload(i think?)

[4:58:01] <suikudo> They insta die to flash gernades

[4:58:09] <Smaenus> Hey don't.. jerk me around, fella
[4:58:11] <KeiPrime> they do not insta die to flash grenades
[4:58:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Th3SmartAlec ...im gonna go burn my old copy of RE0 brb
[4:58:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Isn't there a Dragunov in a room nearby
[4:58:20] <%KeystoneA1> not just goo, CREAMY goo
[4:58:21] <Lenmutt> Pat is so kind giving her a heads up
[4:58:22] <KeiPrime> the big round mouth guys later on do tho
[4:58:23] <%GraceTBM> essentially, they just cost four shotgun shells, but the penalty for fucking up is loading a checkpoint
[4:58:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @XeroSigmaPrime Let's make their dialouge some fanfic level shlock too
[4:58:26] <%Ran196> Goo is always a good sign in any RE game
[4:58:26] <ricky12k> Oh that reminds me. Hey pat my dad’s middle name is pat. Yes what i said is kind of pointless.
[4:58:30] <%Dragon_Batman> Wait maybe not the Dragunov

[4:59:01] <+austenda97og> Pretty sure that was done because wesker knew you werte coming for him.

[4:59:10] <%GraceTBM> herbs don't matter for instakill assholes
[4:59:14] <%NWR_James> Is it wrong I want Pat to accidentally fire the RPG?
[4:59:17] <%natebud> @XeroSigmaPrime And this is all because we had to find out what happened to Bravo Team when the most important thing they ever did was die.
[4:59:30] <KeiPrime> they do have swipe attacks but
[4:59:31] <%Dragon_Batman> @NWR_James Naah it would be funny
[4:59:32] <ricky12k> @xerosigmaprime Because she probably forgot or assume Wesker wasn’t involved idk it’s a plot hole.
[4:59:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> reeeee
[4:59:35] <%GraceTBM> @PatStaresAt use the RPG for funsies
[4:59:38] <+austenda97og> @XeroSigmaPrime because THey thought wesker died when ge got stabbed through the chest by the tyrant
[4:59:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Valdorick He just assumed fate (and himself) would lead Chris to his doorstep

[5:01:39] <ricky12k> I told you pagie was going to die.
[5:01:40] <Dhurkst> stretchy boi
[5:01:52] <%PanicSwytch> I played this game so much but I don't remember this enemy
[5:01:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> spaghetti
[5:02:00] <olwe123> use the grenade launcher on this part
[5:02:01] <awalr> that's a tomb raider reboot grade death scene
[5:02:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Knees weak
[5:02:05] <%Oxybe> Zipzap the buggo
[5:02:05] <superbla25> raviolli
[5:02:06] <SauceJockey> ha peach doesn't even have a handgun, is her aim that bad?
[5:02:06] <+YakumoYomi> Giant Roach standing 720s are OP
[5:02:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> @XeroSigmaPrime Wish Rebecca could have been more than a damsel in distress in a movie, but at least she becomes a teacher/researcher which make sense
[5:02:08] <DandyMackeroos> Spaghetti?
[5:02:11] <%Estuko> monkaS
[5:02:15] <KeiPrime> the mouth guys have a worse one, its the only visual dismemberment in the game, like when you get chainsawed in this game, the camera doesnt show it, and is framed so thehead isnt visible
[5:02:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Zombiemowlcher the electric rod and the electric grenade rounds. each hit of the rod will render it into the weak spot showing. It's just risky
[5:02:24] <KeiPrime> but it doesnt come off
[5:02:26] <peachy996> Paige I'm gonna eat Spaghetti tomorrow night bc of this stream
[5:02:36] <DandyMackeroos> @th3smartalec Aw, in the movies?
[5:02:37] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[5:02:39] <ricky12k> Hmm well at least they be pre... Not going jynx them.
[5:02:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud Oh god... Rebecca goes through all of RE0 but somehow turns back into a scared girl in 1...
[5:02:45] <%Oxybe> Skreeonk
[5:02:46] <linkoftermina> hi pat
[5:02:46] <%Dragon_Batman> That is short for Ready Spaghetti @DandyMackeroos
[5:02:54] <Alexisonfires> REEEE IM A BUG quackREE
[5:02:56] <Lenmutt> quick turn would be good here
[5:02:59] <%GraceTBM> this enemy is like a walking, foggy QTE zone
[5:03:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Th3SmartAlec Yea, RE0 shes badass but then is a scared little girl in RE1...
[5:03:01] <DandyMackeroos> @th3smartalec They kinda make Rebecca lame in the movie
[5:03:02] <KeiPrime> NO SOLD
[5:03:03] <CoxAnbals> big nothing
[5:03:05] <nuane> S T R O N G
[5:03:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DandyMackeroos Yeah, Vendetta I think? The one where the goofy Chris running in circle meme
[5:03:10] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[5:03:17] <ricky12k> Pagie get out of there.
[5:03:17] <linkoftermina> hi chat
[5:03:20] <%GraceTBM> rebecca has almost nothing to do and not much spunk in the CG movie
[5:03:21] <%natebud> @XeroSigmaPrime Remember that time she's nearly killed by one hunter. And she doesn't even know piano!
[5:03:25] <+TheBitingIrish> Shinji Mikami hates Rebecca
[5:03:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> whiff
[5:03:28] <%Dragon_Batman> Wow he lives
[5:03:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DandyMackeroos I figured. That's a shame.
[5:03:31] <peachy996> Oh wow this track IS nice
[5:03:31] <%Neo_Kaiser> If only Pat had a rocket launcher
[5:03:35] <nuane> la cucaracha
[5:03:43] <DandyMackeroos> @gracetbm She’s literally an damsel in distress
[5:03:46] <%Sir_stride> YOOOOOOO
[5:03:47] <%GraceTBM> rebecca also cowers from zombies like an anime protagonist instead of fighing like an RE character
[5:03:47] <peachy996> What a great track for a shit bug
[5:03:51] <ricky12k> Pat why aren’t you using the rocket?
[5:03:51] <%SoFarFetched> POWER STONE?
[5:03:54] <%Jekado> OH NO POWER STONE
[5:03:55] <Dhurkst> I like how the claws make sparks on stuff they touch as it moves. That's a nice detail
[5:03:56] <%Estuko> PogChamp POWER STONE
[5:03:56] <%SoFarFetched> OOHHHH NOOO
[5:03:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHEN POWRSTON
[5:03:58] <bashful_bard> I've never heard the piano part of that track
[5:03:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paige loves running up to them
[5:03:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Capcom still remembers?
[5:04:00] <%Sir_stride> yo. we getting the INFINITY gauntlet
[5:04:02] <cant_pick_a_name> 4 bullets huh
[5:04:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> So THATS where that franchise went
[5:04:06] <%natebud> I hate Rebecca too.
[5:04:09] <%GraceTBM> whatchu savin the rocket for patty boi
[5:04:09] <%Tyonidus> This bug is so much lamer than the re4 ones, the older ones were so agile and could even turn invisible...wtf happened to these guys?
[5:04:10] <%Jekado> well the remember in RE5 i guess
[5:04:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @natebud Ok lets stop, my brain cant handle this much RE0... im gonna go hang myself
[5:04:16] <DandyMackeroos> @dragon_batman I didn’t know that was a thing
[5:04:21] <bashful_bard> The rest chunks its HP
[5:04:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> How is it that we have not had a powerstone game or a powerstone knockoff
[5:04:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh shit, I didn't know about Power Stone when I first played this game LUL
[5:04:29] <ricky12k> Alright then.
[5:04:30] <Paperware> I'll never understand why enemies will not only reveal their weakpoints but also inflate them
[5:04:31] <%Dragon_Batman> @DandyMackeroos Honestly I forgot
[5:04:31] <%natebud> @XeroSigmaPrime Let's take a break and talk about CVX LUL
[5:04:38] <%Oxybe> That a goo dreamcast game
[5:04:42] <+YakumoYomi> @goose_attack_almanac Oh shit...you're right!
[5:04:51] <%GraceTBM> you gotta be fair paperware
[5:04:52] <%SoFarFetched> @XeroSigmaPrime @natebud sounds like you both need a Jill Sandwich to make it better LUL
[5:04:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Thank god Rev2 saves Claire from her CVX "I need my brother and Steve" portrayal.
[5:05:01] <Lenmutt> i thought she was gonna walk into the fire....
[5:05:12] <Aydarkzero> @Th3SmartAlec she's better when she isn't worried about Chris
[5:05:13] <peachy996> @Th3SmartAlec Also gives Barry something to do, also Alex
[5:05:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> funny enough chris's infinite minigun straight up kills the reaper cause the shots go everywhere so they heat the weak spots no matter what
[5:05:17] <%GraceTBM> oh yeah, claire kicks ass in Rev 2, i really appreciate it
[5:05:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Wooo didn't get boxed
[5:05:22] <KeiPrime> remake re5 with re6 movement
[5:05:23] <%natebud> Frogger would be so much better with tank controls
[5:05:25] <%Jekado> part made no sense like just pad out the game section
[5:05:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched ...SHUT UP SHE-WESKER
[5:05:26] <%falineth> falineth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[5:05:26] <peachy996> Plot wise I love Rev2 and wish that was the real RE5
[5:05:27] <DandyMackeroos> @th3smartalec I quite like Rev2, but I haven’t gotten to finishing it.
[5:05:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Wait so is the Uroburos fight here
[5:05:41] <Lenmutt> good
[5:05:44] <KeiPrime> its coming up
[5:05:45] <peachy996> Not here
[5:05:49] <%Estuko> God, I dread that uroburos qte
[5:05:50] <%heartlesshealer> puddle of cat
[5:05:50] <+tsatoma> Soon Kappa
[5:05:51] <%GraceTBM> @KeiPrime I bet if you could move while shooting as RE5 is, you'd split the difference
[5:05:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat, you did fight a boss. The reaper
[5:05:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Funny enough but everytime i look at claire's face in Revelations 2, she reminds me so much of paige
[5:05:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ooooh nu
[5:05:56] <SauceJockey> oh boy this part
[5:05:56] <peachy996> Ah Crazy Talk'd
[5:05:59] <Dhurkst> Rev2? What's her Instant Kill? lol
[5:06:00] <%GarbageNirvana> psaGib
[5:06:02] <bashful_bard> Yes that fight is coming up
[5:06:02] <KeiPrime> yeah i guess
[5:06:03] <%xUmbraNinja> psaWink
[5:06:05] <%Dragon_Batman> My brain is mixing these sequences
[5:06:07] <MassConnect> everything is a boss if you suck hard enough
[5:06:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> here we go
[5:06:08] <%heartlesshealer> flame rounds
[5:06:12] <+TheBitingIrish> Omg, the resub notif is silly against a black background
[5:06:13] <%heartlesshealer> flame rounds exist
[5:06:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DandyMackeroos There's a really strong line at the end (be warned, there is a bad and good ending triggered by some ambigious trigger)
[5:06:16] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[5:06:20] <%Jekado> flame thrower fight
[5:06:21] <CoxAnbals> oh gross this fight
[5:06:24] <peachy996> Call it
[5:06:27] <%GraceTBM> just quit out and go back in with a clearer inventory
[5:06:29] <%SoFarFetched> shotty2hotty
[5:06:31] <%SvenHolgersson> You hear about V's voice actor being a huge troll on Twitter?
[5:06:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Which apparently is broken in Ps4
[5:06:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> oh this one
[5:06:36] <CrazyMedicine> oh no
[5:06:37] <KeiPrime> yo mean the rocketlauncher fiht

[5:06:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> OH NO
[5:06:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the fight that in sometimes super buggy and unwineable
[5:06:42] <+SlappyMeats> yo this party SUUUUUCKS
[5:06:45] <%GraceTBM> i thought this was a different room
[5:06:46] <+SlappyMeats> part*

[5:06:47] <peachy996> Oh you want to hit the checkpoint first?
[5:06:47] <%Estuko> HERE WE FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:06:49] <%natebud> isn't this fight that's bugged to be super hard?
[5:06:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DandyMackeroos When you get an ending just look up what you have to do
[5:06:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Is the flamethrower the thing that breaks?
[5:06:59] <DandyMackeroos> @th3smartalec Oh yeah, I spoiled myself. So that trigger is a little silly, but makes sense in the context of things.
[5:06:59] <%GraceTBM> this fight was always tedious
[5:07:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Like buggy wise
[5:07:03] <bashful_bard> Oh he brought it for this
[5:07:05] <peachy996> It's not bugged just TEDIOUS
[5:07:07] <%GraceTBM> it just takes so long

[5:07:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> RE7????
[5:07:54] <%GraceTBM> i've skipped that cutscene so many times that i forgot it looked like a person
[5:07:54] <Meekest> No SHIT its a BOW Sheva
[5:07:55] <CoxAnbals> RPG
[5:07:58] <%Jekado> So you can't hit it properly its why pat has the Rocket launcher
[5:07:58] <bashful_bard> Oh no he's hot D:
[5:08:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> this is what happens when you don't check your burgers for worms

[5:08:14] <Aydarkzero> UGH
[5:08:16] <olwe123> This boss fight sucks
[5:08:16] <CrazyMedicine> Full Metal?
[5:08:18] <peachy996> BY WORMS
[5:08:22] <MoroseLoki> Corona Virus
[5:08:25] <%GraceTBM> so it makes the flamethrower damage worse? it seems like a higher framerate would be likely to do the opposite
[5:08:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Eugenics huh
[5:08:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...What's your vision?
[5:08:32] <%Niney_Who> This dumb fucking BUGGED boss
[5:08:32] <%heartlesshealer> that's not how evolution works
[5:08:35] <Smaenus> They should invent a gun that could be used from medium to long range distances
[5:08:37] <DandyMackeroos> Except no
[5:08:37] <%SvenHolgersson> How Pat worms = evolution
[5:08:38] <%Valdorick> Extinction Event!?
[5:08:38] <%GraceTBM> they don't shoot in cutscenes cause EXPOSITION
[5:08:39] <%SvenHolgersson> EX PX
[5:08:41] <%lionmanguy> Why can't you just do euthanasia like a normal psychopath
[5:08:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hate this boss so goddamn much
[5:08:42] <peachy996> Hi Ji-I mean hi Bird Woman
[5:08:44] <bashful_bard> This is always my rpg fight
[5:08:44] <$lotharrio> The plan is to make a giant monster world!
[5:08:45] <%Jekado> @GraceTBM you would think huh
[5:08:48] <+YakumoYomi> Complete. Global. Saturation.
[5:08:50] <+necrocannibal2> they're not playing on PC guys
[5:08:50] <Aydarkzero> this is the second Capcom game to use Evolution as it's main plot point
[5:08:52] <%natebud> He's too crunchy
[5:08:53] <Lenmutt> she's such a dumb femdom so sad...
[5:08:55] <smugjorgen98> @Th3SmartAlec guns are too powerful in a cutscene thats why they dont use them
[5:08:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Their plan is so fucking dumb
[5:08:58] <DandyMackeroos> You know, until Excella becomes a worm person too
[5:09:04] <tigerfang86> Shut up tho pat
[5:09:04] <%lionandfox21> Man this is dumb as hell
[5:09:05] <peachy996> No one is chosen in this process btw
[5:09:06] <%MrDonTacos_> SENTIENT DILDOS monkaS
[5:09:08] <Fear_Ranjer> Anybody else wanted to see what this poor sap would've been like in a fight? Like a toned-down Wesker with tentacle attacks?
[5:09:09] <CrazyMedicine> Maybe she's into that
[5:09:09] <cherubs_anonymous> No shut up tho Pat
[5:09:09] <%trustycoyote> Yeah, basically
[5:09:10] <KeiPrime> waht do you mean UNTIL
[5:09:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> just more Olive Gardens
[5:09:12] <%Konquerer> more tentacles more better
[5:09:13] <%GraceTBM> like, do you never want to go to a mall again???
[5:09:13] <$lotharrio> Yeah, but you'll be something like a Tyrant.

[5:17:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> I hope so
[5:17:27] <%jemeralddragoon> @DandyMackeroos the canon has been changed and now that is indeed what I said
[5:17:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[5:17:33] <peachy996> They are just as sexless as Chris himself
[5:17:36] <Dhurkst> LUL LUL LUL
[5:17:40] <%GraceTBM> they just don't emphasize sex specifically like in DMC
[5:17:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Th3SmartAlec the injection are so that the virus he already had that made him into a terminator with super speed, don't kill him. To be honest i don't think e ever planed to infect himself with uroboros. Just use it to make super human docile servants
[5:17:43] <%NWR_James> Leon's a virgin
[5:17:44] <%cvp5127> just like in japan LUL
[5:17:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wesker already fucked

[5:17:50] <Smaenus> What if they're just Ken dolls down there
[5:17:50] <peachy996> Chris did not fuck Ada
[5:17:51] <%MrDonTacos_> NTR
[5:17:54] <Djinnazz> no
[5:17:58] <%trustycoyote> I'd be more OK with characters just being sterile
[5:17:59] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt What if they're good christians who abstain?
[5:18:00] <+KennyK> What if they made it so that Leon's dick just fell off ?
[5:18:00] <$lotharrio> Ada slapped Leon's dick and winked at him. That's the most sex they ever had.
[5:18:01] <%GraceTBM> it's just not really relevant if they banged afterward
[5:18:01] <CoxAnbals> playing bowling>
[5:18:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Playing with balls
[5:18:03] <StarlitStunner> stripDizz stripDizz stripDizz
[5:18:03] <+Dr_Mooose> Leon too pure for that
[5:18:04] <peachy996> Maybe Chris and Piers fucked?

[5:18:18] <%natebud> definitely @peachy996
[5:18:19] <thedank> NWF
[5:18:19] <KaseKaizer> it was like that Plague comic LUL
[5:18:20] <Lenmutt> Leon needs to stop chasing Ada and team up with Sheva.
[5:18:20] <Smaenus> Nice save, Pat
[5:18:20] <%NWR_James> Leon thinks sex is icky
[5:18:22] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Leon canonically wears a chastity belt
[5:18:23] <%srkAres> THE LAS PLAGAS ARE DEAD WHERE WE FUCKED, LEON
[5:18:24] <%GraceTBM> yeah that's what she was like
[5:18:25] <DandyMackeroos> I mean the most sexual tension is between Leon and Ada
[5:18:26] <$lotharrio> Kinda my catchphrase.
[5:18:27] <%Shadowpint> The movies are canon though
[5:18:30] <%natebud> Wesker has a kid.
[5:18:31] <whitemck> Leon straight up looks like a virgin lmaoooooooo
[5:18:33] <%NickNackProductions> Pat psaBig embarrass
[5:18:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Leon likes the chase

[5:18:47] <%Conyst> They are the pandas of their world @patstaresat
[5:18:50] <%Nina96> LUL
[5:18:50] <+SlappyMeats> Leon is always on the south end of fuck. The reason Leon survived RE2 is because he was late arriving to his first day as a result of being hungover, having drank off a breakup the night before.
[5:18:52] <CrazyMedicine> The Prison Island
[5:18:52] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also in Degeneration, Claire says to a lady with her that she is dating a guy in india or some other country

[5:21:05] <Smaenus> Holy shit that's amazing
[5:21:10] <+necrocannibal2> get a what
[5:21:12] <Dhurkst> damn son
[5:21:15] <%Dragon_Batman> He has very good and terrible memory
[5:21:16] <%natebud> At one point in RE6 a giant monster screams, "how could my family abandon me?" and cries. It's going to be a wild ride.

[5:21:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 21m.
[5:21:18] <%GraceTBM> i feel like the issue with the CG movies was that leon was a little too shadow the hedgehog
[5:21:25] <%Agami23> studying mind goblins?
[5:21:36] <DandyMackeroos> Leon was very edge wasn’t he?
[5:21:37] <%Jekado> mail bag days shit
[5:21:38] <%DrFacilier> 6
[5:21:39] <+necrocannibal2> mailbags were the shit
[5:21:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I hate the word Mensa. It means dumbass in slang spanish
[5:21:39] <%GraceTBM> i feel like that was like 6 years ago
[5:21:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @GraceTBM i will defend the stupid awesome shit in Damnation but in Vendetta when chris and blond bad guy are ice skating on a solid flour dodging their bullets is just plain stupid
[5:21:48] <%Agami23> i remember i used plague to graduate my final huge project for high school
[5:21:49] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[5:21:53] <%TheWinged7> just like every sunday night

[5:22:10] <+necrocannibal2> @miguelrod777 true
[5:22:12] <DandyMackeroos> THE PAYLOAD MISSED
[5:22:12] <awalr> CAN I MAKE IT
[5:22:13] <%natebud> @morcego_cinzento_arts I need an endless loop of them running in a circle and shooting the floor.
[5:22:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not the FINAL BONE
[5:22:16] <%GraceTBM> @morcego_cinzento_arts it was a beautiful love letter to stupid animated cg action and the edgelord in me can appreciate the tacticool
[5:22:17] <%jemeralddragoon> @morcego_cinzento_arts don't forget that Leon murders people with dogs on a highway
[5:22:22] <peachy996> Can I make it?
[5:22:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> lewd
[5:22:30] <%heartlesshealer> yup
[5:22:33] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL
[5:22:34] <Lenmutt> Can I make it? How can this be!
[5:22:35] <%GraceTBM> that dog highway scene made me crack up in the theater
[5:22:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How... can this be
[5:22:40] <DandyMackeroos> @jemeralddragoon That’s not real
[5:22:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @DandyMackeroos boy i wish i didn't. they be like "hey remember how chris in Re6 was a washed up drunk asshole and that was the worst ever? let's make it with Leon"
[5:22:45] <%Monkeyweed21> you had to stop the stream to cry
[5:22:45] <Hydrapissed> lol
[5:22:47] <%Neo_Kaiser> Why didn't Pat crawl up into Paiges lap and cry?
[5:22:47] <Quilltaz> I mean unless it starts floating in midair and then slowly ascends into space its gotta hit something
[5:22:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Clips maybe?
[5:22:52] <%miguelrod777> "BITCH WHAT THE FUCK"- Pat
[5:22:54] <%Valdorick> Balls exposed daily.
[5:22:55] <%heartlesshealer> I still can't get over Paige's reaction to the Horse Girl thing while she was about to take a sip
[5:22:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Oooh you mean start to twitch?
[5:22:58] <peachy996> It WILL happen
[5:23:02] <%CalderGaming> self-deception
[5:23:07] <%ratcan_> slorb
[5:23:10] <%SoFarFetched> NO PANTS STREAM
[5:23:10] <%ssjklyco> When you go live, you must live with it.
[5:23:11] <Smaenus> With every moment you stream, the chances increase
[5:23:13] <%Valdorick> L-lewd
[5:23:15] <%Ner234> The trick is to expose ball AT ALL TIMES
[5:23:15] <%GraceTBM> i think RE protagonists being washed up drunks is just a lame fucking idea
[5:23:16] <%srkAres> its all in good fun
[5:23:16] <+Dr_Mooose> we have seen all of the ball
[5:23:16] <%heartlesshealer> it's more real
[5:23:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> PatStaresAtPaige'sBalls
[5:23:17] <peachy996> Matt, Woolie and yourself have multiple cases
[5:23:17] <%vectorless_peon> Extreem naivete and wild overconfidence
[5:23:18] <DandyMackeroos> @morcego_cinzento_arts Golly, they did that with Chris first?
[5:23:20] <awalr> get a dedicated ball cam
[5:23:26] <peachy996> Liam...I'm not sure
[5:23:28] <%natebud> @morcego_cinzento_arts That should be the deafult way they reintroduce every RE character from now on. Rebecca, Sherry, Billy, everyone
[5:23:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'M A GENIUS! OH NO!
[5:23:30] <hntronium> dumbing kruger
[5:23:30] <%CalderGaming> not quite
[5:23:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Over confidence is usually your downfall
[5:23:36] <peachy996> I don't remember his balls
[5:23:37] <%GraceTBM> I think Paige might have a reverse dunning effect
[5:23:41] <$lotharrio> That's not it.
[5:23:43] <%jemeralddragoon> Liam only ever got called out on his creepy anime bullshit
[5:23:46] <+necrocannibal2> wait
[5:23:46] <%Neo_Kaiser> A group of 4 Halo players once tried to stream snipe me as revenge for having a different opinion.
[5:23:47] <Lenmutt> Peach's accidental dodging skills are top tier tho
[5:23:52] <%SaiyanShoto> You two sometimes just pull each others pants down and laugh at both your exposed balls
[5:23:52] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud Being drunk and virgins?
[5:23:53] <+necrocannibal2> I don't think that's it
[5:23:55] <%SolverCODO> errrrrr
[5:24:00] <%Valdorick> Reminder yourself that Overconfidence is a fast and hilarious killer.
[5:24:02] <%joylent_blue> that's basically it
[5:24:05] <+Clik404> That’s the exact opposite
[5:24:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> why can't they kick the ball perfectly
[5:24:07] <Hydrapissed> yep
[5:24:08] <%Konquerer> that sounds off
[5:24:09] <%Agami23> so pats a silent hill expert
[5:24:09] <peachy996> Wait Liam got ball exposed on the Sonic 06 LP
[5:24:09] <+garagon31> Dunning Kruger is being too stupid to realize you're stupid
[5:24:11] <%jemeralddragoon> @Neo_Kaiser did you wreck them and humiliate them?
[5:24:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @GraceTBM the only thing good i'll give that movie is when chris is dooing wrestlemania moves with bayonet rifle on zombies and leon is doing john wick bs
