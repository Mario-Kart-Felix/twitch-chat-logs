[0:22:55] <%deathscythe1287> @patstaresat Wasps are assholes who have roommates
[0:22:55] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat given the stories shared in the last week you would likely poke the nest and the hornets will just fly up into her office window.
[0:22:55] <Meekest> Every wasp can make 5000 nests
[0:22:55] <%KetsuoTaberu> I have no idea
[0:22:57] <+MTLxSpider> Wasp are fking thieves

[0:26:51] <%king_wragles> Oh, if you damaged the nest there's a good chance the wasp just abandoned it completely. Wasps are unfortunately smart, but at least they know if it didn't leave it'd die

[0:26:55] <nivlac_555> You kill the wasps and then scrape the nest down
[0:26:55] <%luftraumm1> thats not how figs WORK
[0:26:56] <@commanderclaw> It dissolves the nest
[0:26:56] <ThighsSupreme> It does tho,
[0:26:56] <jbrachob> KILL THE WASP AND THEN TAKE DOWN THE NEST}

[0:55:19] <Aydarkzero> it's rough but damn is that combat nice

[0:56:42] <randomahole> is it too late to ask about Pat's reaction to the smash dlc reveal?

[0:56:43] <$Futurecity10> The colelctor ship and reaper IFF
[0:56:44] <%valriot> Theres 5
[0:56:46] <%Ranryu692> 1 is better
[0:56:51] <%Ipsenscastle> ME2 is about the sidequests, if you're focusing on the main quests you're missing the point
[0:56:54] <peachy996> And the mission to get the reaper iff
[0:56:56] <PanicSwytch> FF origins support makes Donald and Goofy look like professionals
[0:56:57] <%dekkitout> Not sure how to feel about that since side quests are kinda my b&b
[0:56:59] <RevolverBobkat> you just need to save the galaxy
[0:57:00] <DatAsuna> well mordin is mandatory too
[0:57:00] <+slumberseven> ME2 is basically filler in the context of the trilogy.
[0:57:01] <%Dfreddy8> *Universe
[0:57:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect 2 is the best one in the series, and the worst one for the lore
[0:57:04] <tanarath> 6,pat
[0:57:04] <%valriot> Then why did they set up saving the world in ME1? LUL
[0:57:05] <%maskofmichael> But they do save the world in the end
[0:57:06] <+tigerfang86> the gang HAS to be cool though
[0:57:08] <DatAsuna> and the IFF yeah
[0:57:08] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also disco
[0:57:10] <+tigerfang86> create a good gang
[0:57:11] <%logoth_> If you focus on the main quest you die super hard
[0:57:11] <+pectusumbra> And that's why Iruma-kun is a great manga
[0:57:15] <%MassConnect> but you technically save several world's worth of colonies
[0:57:17] <+MidnightBurst12> ME1 felt like that too, imo
[0:57:18] <%BeeComfy> Thank you
[0:57:20] <CatRidder> pat you need to save he world from CHAOS
[0:57:21] <@SoFarFetched> @BoxNavy yeah no discord command since the discord isn't public and only if you're a sub you can get it.
[0:57:22] <+trackles_64> just your squad at least
[0:57:23] <ralphfromdk> Yes. Give me a game with no real main story, just a ton of really good side stories. The end
[0:57:28] <$RealThiele> its what made avatar work
[0:57:31] <MarylandJutsu> GIEF BUTT
[0:57:31] <+OhioNitsud> Tekken is fun but heard they done a bad job balancing characters and ofc Harada and the online
[0:57:33] <TourettesPlays> Doing a human supremacist Shepard on ME right now, its fun being so self sabotaging
[0:57:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Disco is super not low stakes
[0:57:39] <@SoFarFetched> he snorting
[0:57:44] <DatAsuna> well avatar did save the world tho
[0:57:54] <%dekkitout> Spooder lore
[0:57:58] <+tigerfang86> GOT EM

[0:58:20] <%BoxNavy> @SoFarFetched makes sense. maybe we can get a discord command that tells people to link their twitch to their discord and all that stuff?

[1:09:36] <%Varlinator> Get Dat BBQ!
[1:09:40] <%Cykron> i'm so confused
[1:10:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> what does 3rd seal do
[1:10:13] <+Punchasaur> game loud
[1:10:13] <%Treuan> Oh thank goodness, Gearhead
[1:10:19] <MayorRev> Get Jill's Sandwich PogChamp
[1:10:22] <+Kduff89> nah its fine
[1:10:23] <@SoFarFetched> @MrBorisMakarov The last 2/3/4 Survivors hit with your Basic Attack suffer from the Blindness IconStatusEffects vision.png Status Effect.
[1:10:23] <%Cykron> very loud game
[1:10:23] <%Chichen> ye its a tad loud
[1:10:23] <%Treuan> on hit survivors become blind
[1:10:24] <%BoxNavy> kinda
[1:10:28] <%Dfreddy8> ONE GUY
[1:10:28] <peachy996> Game is not loud
[1:10:28] <+D00msDayDan> i'm watching two DBD streams and hearing this sound so much is maddening
[1:10:29] <%DianaTheAscian> a bit
[1:10:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> Lil bit
[1:10:33] <Daxalog> Soo. After a couple levels it starts locking them in a chain? Until the next level?
[1:10:33] <TheFramedWarlock> Bit loud
[1:10:34] <%Varlinator> lil bit
[1:10:34] <+Shady_Zaku> teeny bit loud
[1:10:34] <@SoFarFetched> oops didnt mean to get the rest of that LUL
[1:10:35] <crocboyz> like a litte too loud
[1:10:35] <Decarcassor> 3rd seal is a hex perk that make survivor blind when you hit them
[1:10:36] <PanicSwytch> Just a tad
[1:10:37] <peachy996> Was perfectly fine
[1:10:37] <%spoiledbadger> a bit
[1:10:37] <+sekshun789> But it takes an actual eternity because RNG and each perk has 3 levels, and you have to buy a bunch of garbage
[1:10:41] <%GingaNZ> bit loud
[1:10:41] <Dunmarkh> 5 guys
[1:10:41] <theshillman> no its a bit loud
[1:10:43] <tanarath> It's fine
[1:10:43] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! 
[1:10:43] <+Kduff89> Maybe its cause im not using a headset
[1:10:44] <%psidefx> Just a tad
[1:10:45] <+pectusumbra> Is there no reason to not take the perk so it's out of the pool?
[1:10:47] <peachy996> Bunch of elderly in here
[1:10:48] <Profmcstevie> game is a lil loud, it's a dramatic soundtrack after all
[1:10:48] <%spoiledbadger> better
[1:10:54] <Pookiedaexzile> RNG for Perks is never good
[1:10:56] <%DianaTheAscian> good
[1:10:56] <shotgang86> way better
[1:10:58] <%athuramn> great burgers @dunmarkh
[1:10:58] <%Varlinator> shame we won't be seeing the new map today
[1:10:59] <TheFramedWarlock> Better
[1:11:06] <%Treuan> Infectious is okay
[1:11:06] <theshillman> better
[1:11:09] <Sol_Install> BIG BOI
[1:11:13] <LunarRemix> Is it like a random chance to get a perk?
[1:11:14] <+sekshun789> Third seal let’s you apply blindness to each survivor you hit with a basic attack for as long as the hex is up. It’s pretty dookie, only has niche build uses
[1:11:23] <+sekshun789> @lunarremix yup
[1:11:33] <@SoFarFetched> @LunarRemix its very RNG especially because at levels 30,35,and 40 you unlock the perk to be pickable on other webs.
[1:11:47] <@SoFarFetched> so you can get fucked on not getting the perks you want
[1:11:47] <+iceyfirefox> its satisfying af to watch those points drain
[1:11:51] <@SoFarFetched> until like WAY later
[1:12:14] <Zeif00> Eruption is real good
[1:12:15] <%Garthunox> isnt discordance 1 better?
[1:12:20] <+sekshun789> Pretty much. You just hope your early webs have good perks. They don’t have 4 perks per web until way high level
[1:12:23] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat what perks are in the shrine this week?
[1:12:46] <Decarcassor> @Garthunox they fixed it. lvl 3 is better now
[1:12:49] <%Varlinator> Wow, everyone hates hysteria perk huh?
[1:12:51] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:12:52] <Discount_CJ> sure
[1:12:54] <%StaceMcGate> 20 minutes later
[1:12:54] <splinter1619> I'm just so happy leon got his re4 outfit
[1:12:55] <Daxalog> So what does an Offering do?
[1:12:56] <+iceyfirefox> lets chill
[1:12:57] <Dunmarkh> no
[1:12:57] <+trackles_64> let there be violence
[1:12:57] <%Garthunox> Oh shit, good
[1:13:03] <extradopeness> oh my god pat fatal frame tho
[1:13:03] <crocboyz> i dont know
[1:13:05] <@SoFarFetched> @Ascethetic Diversion,Distortion, Hoarder,Deathbound
[1:13:06] <+Lulu19> Does this game have crossplay?
[1:13:09] <MonsterGills> Does Nem have cosmetics
[1:13:09] <+iceyfirefox> @splinter1619 hell yeah
[1:13:21] <%Garthunox> god dammit im gonna reinstall this game again arent i?
[1:13:23] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:13:23] <Jokobeast> Dang, you really blasted through those bloodpoints, huh?
[1:13:24] <@SoFarFetched> Cross play but can be region locked I believe.
[1:13:25] <%Gogogolem> Disable cross play immediately.
[1:13:27] <%BoxNavy> i was expecting a "but"
[1:13:28] <CaptainKarite> Nope
[1:13:31] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> None right now.
[1:13:31] <+RobPiresLu> So Pat addopted the Woolie learning of just playing the boss character
[1:13:33] <+Lulu19> dope
[1:13:35] <Ralyks9117> hey patt
[1:13:36] <%Treuan> Just prestige
[1:13:38] <MayorRev> How's Leon? His flashbang seems fun
[1:13:38] <Daxalog> Whats the buring icons when the match starts?
[1:13:41] <Daxalog> burning*
[1:13:41] <%shurtal> pat forgot to tweet
[1:13:44] <lKaleidoscopel> nope
[1:13:44] <Decarcassor> Its even on Stadia. If anybody care. :p
[1:13:45] <+PaleWhitePerson> the prestige nemesis stuff looks pretty cool on him
[1:13:45] <%Ascethetic> @sofarfetched thanks, still waiting for Pop to show up
[1:13:46] <Zeif00> He just has prestige cosmetics, but they look good
[1:13:49] <%Treuan> His pretige head is dope though
[1:13:52] <shotgang86> someone should call out sony's bullshit on the "crossplay tax"
[1:13:54] <%Chichen> Yeet
[1:13:56] <+trackles_64> is anyone on tonight?
[1:13:58] <@SoFarFetched> @Daxalog offerings that can either give people more blood points,alter things on the map or mori
[1:14:01] <%Varlinator> Leon gets his RE4 jacket & that's all i ever wanted
[1:14:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> I've heard that crossplay makes the netcode work even worse. My BF has had streams RUINED by that.
[1:14:09] <Daxalog> oh
[1:14:10] <MayorRev> yeet that tweet
[1:14:12] <@SoFarFetched> oh and also more possiblities to get a certain map
[1:14:14] <+iceyfirefox> is Leon fun to play?
[1:14:18] <%ShogunNoonto> RIPCheer1500 Why didn't they bother to pimp the nemesis crossover DLC in the capcom showcase
[1:14:19] <oniwahoo> @decarcassor All 12 of them should be excited
[1:14:20] <%spoiledbadger> lap voice pat

[1:14:29] <CaptainKarite> Yeah, she looks wrong
[1:14:31] <@commanderclaw> She had a chinectomy
[1:14:35] <splinter1619> I think it's funny that Leon's still baby leon from 2make with the re4 jacket
[1:14:36] <%StaceMcGate> a curse of the redfield heritage
[1:14:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat Bitch lookin sussy
[1:14:36] <Zeif00> Claire looks better in match
[1:14:37] <Profmcstevie> Claire is a fucking duck
[1:14:41] <anAngryHamster> I thought it was just Leon and Jill
[1:14:47] <+trackles_64> I thought dbd online was dead
[1:14:49] <mattmmkay> Gettiing matches is gonna take a while
[1:14:51] <+Lulu19> the re models look almost ripped
[1:14:52] <lKaleidoscopel> the math is apparently 3.5 mil bp for the bloody costume
[1:14:54] <+vaderxyz1970> The bloodline must continue Leon
[1:14:57] <mattmmkay> not gonna lie. The servers are absolute shit today

[1:15:09] <IminyourBase> pat big thief

[1:15:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no not the servers :)
[1:15:21] <Zeif00> btw I think Otz said to play Nemy like an M1 killer unless surivors are at pallets/windows or zoned out, then tentacle

[1:21:22] <twohitgood> probably need to warm up first.
[1:21:23] <$Falilth> The box on this chest is a power limiter  In the original RE3, Nemesis' limiter coat is destroyed following its battle against Jill and Carlos outside the St. Michael Clock Tower. Without its limiter, it undergoes a minor mutation: its skin changes tone and it grows more parasitic tentacles from its right arm. "

[1:38:10] <+Arek_1> @Gamblitz Oh, haven't heard of that one. I'm a little wary of Kaico. They didn't play nice with the open source license for the OSSC. I've heard that RE4 when running through the component cable (or digital) actually runs at a reduced chroma sampling.
[1:38:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat has a very high CPS
[1:38:16] <%PatNTheHat> We should make a "pump" a unit of measurement equal to 6 inches or so, so when you call someone a "two-pump chump" you're saying they have a footlong schlong
[1:38:19] <%Mendin> Nemesis is just Melee Plague with adds, prove me wrong
[1:38:22] <%dekkitout> @balthazar758 Canada had cowboys, right?
[1:38:24] <%Mendin> (That's not a bad thing)

[1:38:28] <%king_wragles> min maxing?
[1:38:29] <+tempestzephyr> it's be insane if it broke them at the same time
[1:38:30] <%Arancet> what does infecting survivors do?
[1:38:31] <%PatNTheHat> @CommanderSqueaks That's really good
[1:38:31] <%BarujaraciGaming> psa1guy inch, psa2guy tiny balls, psa3guy touch for the cum

[1:38:44] <balthazar758> @dekkitout i dunno lol
[1:38:52] <%Mendin> @Jokobeast That was the first thing I thought when I played him! Have you HEARD Oni walking around?
[1:38:52] <DestroyerPhoenix> @Arancet infection lets them get damaged by zombies or the tentacle
[1:38:59] <tolloponik> I can't get over how Nemesis arms makes him look like he's out on a nice stroll
[1:39:01] <%BoxNavy> VERY balls
[1:39:02] <SkinnyRite> Pulled the RE Spin on you
[1:39:05] <%maenos2> sequins?
[1:39:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nemesis attacks survivors to steal their much larger balls.
[1:39:10] <MarylandJutsu> Pat is here for your BONES
[1:39:17] <%Mendin> Infection also gives them a bit more audio queues
[1:39:19] <cherrycottontail> wow so many balls
[1:39:19] <Dunmarkh> me too
[1:39:20] <awalbaru> Yea man
[1:39:27] <@SoFarFetched> The zombies let you know where survivors are cause they go towards them
[1:39:27] <%BarujaraciGaming> fuck em up sandman, fuck em up
[1:39:29] <sad__coyote> I want real barbecue and chili dude. shit sounds good
[1:39:29] <%ComradeConquistador> Don't make me hungry Pat.
[1:39:31] <theshillman> what does BBQ do?
[1:39:32] <+Okashido> Part of me would have liked Mr. X to be the one who got in, but I get that Nemesis is what his is.
[1:39:34] <%PatNTheHat> What does BBQ and chili do again?
[1:39:37] <%Arancet> @Arancet ah ok
[1:39:38] <+w4rhe4rt_> I'm sure some one has said but use Infection increase addons pat
[1:39:43] <peachy996> What is with the muted Doom music playing?
[1:39:49] <mattmmkay> lets you see survirors when you hook one
[1:39:52] <%BoxNavy> why does nemesis have far away EDM music accompanying him
[1:39:54] <mattmmkay> survivors*
[1:39:54] <DestroyerPhoenix> oh are they just louder Mendin ?
[1:39:59] <amiavamp> no reason there can't be a mr.x skin
[1:39:59] <%PatNTheHat> Oh, nice
[1:40:02] <@SoFarFetched> @theshillman when you hook a survivor you see other survivors beyond a certain distance from you
[1:40:05] <Jokobeast> @Mendin I haven't played much of this at all; it just struck me as really weird hearing like normal footsteps.

[1:41:06] <lKaleidoscopel> there was a rank reset recently
[1:41:09] <@SoFarFetched> Pat please you BARELY made it
[1:41:10] <TourettesPlays> This game is a lot less scary if you imagine everyone making zoidberg noises when they bob and weave
[1:41:11] <mattmmkay> good juking is really hard to learn
[1:41:13] <%IamGrapes> smurfs?
[1:41:15] <+Ghufufin> but why would someone lie on the internet
[1:41:17] <$Mekhet09> Do smurfs exist in this game?
[1:41:18] <%ComfortableStranger> I know nothing about this game, can I still talk trash?
[1:41:22] <+MackFighters> there was someone outside, the zombie knew

[1:41:41] <%Gamblitz> @Arek_1  I can believe it, it looks significantly more washed out than composite. its almost like it was stylistic design choice
[1:41:46] <%Dfreddy8> @patstaresat So how does it feel playing as Milla Jovovichs' husband?
[1:41:47] <%dekkitout> Is smurfing an issue in this game too?
[1:41:48] <%Nuclearcherries> I didn't even know this game was first person O_O
[1:41:49] <%ComradeConquistador> You can talk trash about anything if you try hard enough.
[1:41:49] <+TheNewZealandStory> rank 1 killers and rank 20 killers often get matched against the same teams of survivors
[1:41:49] <VentWilsn> nah TRUST u got this
[1:41:52] <mattmmkay> aryun jukes like crazy
[1:41:56] <%ComfortableStranger> @CommanderSqueaks LOL
[1:41:57] <peachy996> So when Nemesis is on the hunt he's grooving to some edm
[1:42:00] <@SoFarFetched> @Nuclearcherries its first person when you play killer,third person as survivor
[1:42:01] <+Mago565> get genrushed

[1:42:17] <Pookiedaexzile> @ComfortableStranger Just call pat "Baby Balls Boy Veins" when he messes up
[1:42:19] <mattmmkay> rank reset is giving people weird matches apparently

[1:42:36] <Profmcstevie> Just HAVING zombies around get people to second guess going places, it's fun
[1:42:45] <+w4rhe4rt_> there is rank up bug right now I think
[1:42:50] <%Mendin> I wish level 2+ tentacle would break the pallet AND smack the survivor
[1:42:50] <$Mekhet09> It seems op.
[1:42:51] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah that is incredible for a killer
[1:42:52] <+tigerfang86> Zombie bros are cool
[1:42:57] <deviljhojho_> its like you're no longer getting blueballed
[1:43:00] <IminyourBase> they get stuck in an animation so they are dead center of the pallet everytime
[1:43:02] <+w4rhe4rt_> I don't think you can actually rank up RN
[1:43:07] <@SoFarFetched> then get better at loops pat Kappa
[1:43:11] <mattmmkay> and survivors have too many exploits
[1:43:12] <@SoFarFetched> easy
[1:43:16] <+tigerfang86> T R U E
[1:43:18] <benjiFG> they should give survivors guns
[1:43:20] <%DianaTheAscian> is Pyramid head still good?
[1:43:22] <SomeOtherNeb> I love that your steps are in rhythm with the music
[1:43:24] <amiavamp> Presumably Nemesis is balanced around zombies being there though

[1:45:41] <+MackFighters> decisive deactivates now when repairing or healing, it's worthless
[1:45:45] <Link232> Has this Claudette been hit/seen once at all this match
[1:45:45] <VentWilsn> leon caught slackin'
[1:45:46] <+w4rhe4rt_> @MessyBristles I expected to him to have more self respect. he does have NOED so I suppose I am the fool.
[1:45:48] <+Cactuskris> I can't believe there are even enough people willing to play survivor
[1:45:53] <mattmmkay> oh, yea, that's true
[1:45:56] <deviljhojho_> in fact if you aint playing vanguard might as well just not play at all
[1:45:57] <mattmmkay> actually
[1:46:00] <+TheNewZealandStory> why is pat using NOED, that's a bitch perk
[1:46:11] <@SoFarFetched> There's more survivors cause even survivors know they can get super toxic with killers.
[1:46:14] <%Anime_Flux> lol
[1:46:14] <+tigerfang86> Leon please
[1:46:14] <mattmmkay> cuz he's still a baby killer
[1:46:26] <%ComfortableStranger> yeah is ME:LE on hold?
[1:46:28] <+w4rhe4rt_> the higher you go the more you realize survivors are stronger than the killer
[1:46:29] <peachy996> @Pookiedaexzile Not my opinion. Soldier is only okay in ME2 because of the slowdown ability, Vanguard and Infiltrator are still the top 2 classes over Soldier in ME2+ME3
[1:46:30] <awalbaru> D:
[1:46:32] <mattmmkay> people say you can use it up to rank 15
[1:46:35] <VentWilsn> THE JUKE

[1:46:39] <doughboidankweed> ramune5Ramupat
[1:46:43] <SomeOtherNeb> the steps are jsut so musical, I love it
[1:46:43] <%MechArch> squishy punches
[1:46:51] <+MackFighters> there's no rules to DBD, use Noed whenever you want
[1:46:53] <deviljhojho_> win some lose some
[1:46:53] <@SoFarFetched> More Mass Effect 2 after this, Pat wants to play a couple matches at least.
[1:47:02] <$SGrim> @peachy996 counter point: the power of friendship, and all the guns I found.
[1:47:08] <Grandnatics> Can hear her
[1:47:10] <doughboidankweed> the woolie hole is looking a little nicer.
[1:47:15] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 have you tried explosive armor sentinel in ME2?
[1:47:16] <@SoFarFetched> Probably waiting for hatch
[1:47:16] <$Mekhet09> You assume they're friends.
[1:47:18] <%DianaTheAscian> i heard that hatcj
[1:47:24] <%Jekado> probably waiting at hatch
[1:47:27] <deviljhojho_> we should be able to play as nemesis in mass effect 2
[1:47:27] <doughboidankweed> did he hire an interior designer
[1:47:31] <deviljhojho_> and only 2
[1:47:32] <%Mendin> I think I saw a zombie at the far end of the map lunge
[1:47:34] <+MackFighters> hatch isn't open yet
[1:47:37] <%Gamblitz> @Arek_1 The Adapter is still a god send in regard of having true Black levels without snow from analog.
[1:47:45] <@SoFarFetched> yeah the guy needs to die for hatch to open
[1:47:47] <%Mendin> Like if leon is at 12 o clock, down at like 6
[1:47:48] <mattmmkay> no
[1:47:49] <+tigerfang86> YEAAAAAAAAH
[1:47:50] <mattmmkay> some of them wait

[1:47:59] <peachy996> @ComfortableStranger I have actually!! It's not bad but I didn't really fall in love with it like Biotic Charge and Cloak
[1:48:03] <Link232> THEY WERE SELF HEALING
[1:48:03] <Grandnatics> GET THEM DOORS
[1:48:04] <%logoth_> What is that meter for?

[1:58:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> I woke up with a centipede in my bed today, that was fun.
[1:58:25] <%OrangeMDT> OrangeMDT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat, flushed some toilet-cereal recently, and was filled with an unrivaled sense of superiority. Bran flakes with silk milk is good, but if after sleeping for 5 hours they just get too soggy and lukewarm
[1:58:30] <%ComfortableStranger> didn't you find a huge spider under the stairs or something?
[1:58:34] <%VashyronM> burn the bed

[1:58:41] <$lumporr> fuck that for life
[1:58:43] <Grandnatics> Was the centipede hot?
[1:58:44] <Zerud> @Gamblitz nah, the game is fixed 1 vs 4 so it's not possible to make a huge map for all the killers
[1:58:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Waking up with some critter on me is my biggest fear
[1:58:50] <mattmmkay> yea
[1:58:51] <logothete2401> Centipedes are bullshit
[1:58:53] <Profmcstevie> seal your cereal people, the bugs be coming
[1:58:57] <%BoxNavy> what a bunch of malarkey that is
[1:58:57] <danknugglit> Shouldnt have woken up
[1:58:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> It was not great.
[1:59:01] <$lumporr> i hope it wasn't one of those big fast ones
[1:59:02] <jayson_hawk> i destroyed a carpenter ant nest the other day by pouring boiling water on it.
[1:59:05] <mattmmkay> was it like a one-night staand thing?
[1:59:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> My basement has had so many centipedes. But I'm about to lay down the pesticide perimeter
[1:59:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> I had a sleep paralysis thing once where a rat crawled out of my ceiling and jumped on me
[1:59:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mattmmkay It didn't even call me an uber, such a dick.
[1:59:27] <Pookiedaexzile> If you flush ceral I hope your forced to eat the THIRD best bargain brand

[2:07:40] <Grandnatics> Serpentine
[2:07:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat just hit him normal
[2:07:47] <+Grayhammatter> the jukes
[2:07:50] <%AncelDeLambert> or window him, that's good
[2:07:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Aim where he is going
[2:07:53] <lKaleidoscopel> jill has a perk that she can rig a gen with an expolise that when kicked will stun
[2:07:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat WANTS to use the tip
[2:07:57] <mattmmkay> does the blue slime make you regress health?
[2:07:58] <DrkJP520> What's with the blue?
[2:07:59] <Grandnatics> PUNCH
[2:07:59] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaaaaay
[2:08:02] <%Anime_Flux> no just punch
[2:08:02] <$Ziegsy> I like how nemesis shakes his fists in anger
[2:08:04] <%ClericOfSparda> Good job, Pat
[2:08:05] <%ComfortableStranger> wait, so if the survivors have different perks, do you have to learn them all to play killer effectively?
[2:08:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> but tentacle tho
[2:08:06] <+Grayhammatter> PUNCH
[2:08:10] <%VashyronM> but he wants to tentacle him
[2:08:11] <%AncelDeLambert> BREAK HIS BACK AND MAKE HIM XCHAMBLE!
[2:08:12] <%king_wragles> It's way better to invest the time to infect someone, unless you just can't catch them
[2:08:14] <%IamGrapes> you dont pay his sub
[2:08:14] <%QueequegTheater> Pat do you want to use Dragon Install, or do you want to win
[2:08:14] <Zerud> So what was the issue? Pat was aiming to the left instead of center of the screen?
[2:08:15] <Grandnatics> Fisting > Tentacles
[2:08:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> OOF
[2:08:16] <Lixagon> JUST THE TIP
[2:08:16] <peachy996> So is Nemesis just going around spraying survivors with goo from his tentacle
[2:08:18] <circular7> pat wants to slave whip people
[2:08:18] <+chiazam> PAUNCH
[2:08:22] <BigFingerRo> LUL he made a noise like you tickled his butthole
[2:08:25] <%Robot_Nixon_> calebMAD AAAAAAaaaaaaa
[2:08:26] <%maskofmichael> Pat, did you know that to survivors Nemesis is power walking
[2:08:26] <$scallycap> how can the monster even lose?
[2:08:26] <+Lord_Defalt> dont let these people lie to you tentacle attacking for everything is way more optimal
[2:08:28] <balthazar758> PunOko mad PunOko
[2:08:28] <mattmmkay> there should be a bane mori
[2:08:29] <HaroldDonchee> tentacle is cooler
[2:08:30] <BigFingerRo> "OOO!"
[2:08:33] <mattmmkay> for nemmie
[2:08:33] <@SoFarFetched> @ComfortableStranger yeah you pretty much have to level each survivor to 30,35,40 to unlcck that perk on other characters to "possibly" get to level up.
[2:08:34] <Pookiedaexzile> NEmme would use the gens as a weapon
[2:08:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I like how Nemmy just has to do one big kick to a gen
[2:08:38] <%AncelDeLambert> .... I didn't know there were collapsable doors
[2:08:45] <+chiazam> I wonder who was used to make Nemesis, I never really thought about that
[2:08:47] <+w4rhe4rt_> @PatStaresAt USE THE TENTACLE TO BREAK THINGS
[2:08:50] <@SoFarFetched> same goes for killer on getting perks
[2:08:54] <%Jekado> it doesn't work on verticles
[2:08:55] <@SoFarFetched> DbD is VERY grindy
[2:08:57] <+MajorCrasher> it doesn't work up and down @patstaresat
[2:09:00] <Zerud> @scallycap by playing badly either way
[2:09:01] <+chiazam> Like Nemesis was probably just some guy
[2:09:08] <romc215> whipping them with the hand dong
[2:09:12] <%ClericOfSparda> @PatStaresAt Don't use the tentacle on the  stairs. It doesn't do stairs well
[2:09:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Elevation is hard Pat
[2:09:17] <DestroyerPhoenix> @AncelDeLambert yeah, they spawn on different spots on the buildings and stuff
[2:09:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Doom swamp music
[2:09:23] <%Aleate> @AncelDeLambert They started putting them in maps about a year ago. With Deathslinger I think, then they started to go back and add them to old maps too, like this one
[2:09:23] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooh that was a lucky hit
[2:09:25] <mattmmkay> how many hours do you have in it?
[2:09:26] <@SoFarFetched> "TAG you're it!"
[2:09:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> PAUNCH
[2:09:26] <+MajorCrasher> LUL

[2:10:44] <magboost> Oh that makes sense thanks @QueequegTheater
[2:10:44] <%cafefunk> Everyones favorite game of is it an orgasm or mutilation
[2:10:47] <historynutjackson> But the fiercest is GIEF'S HUNGER

[2:11:19] <%Jekado> well there is hatch

[2:11:19] <peachy996> You guys never played this mission in ME2?

[2:11:29] <%emperordread> Buddy system 4 life
[2:11:29] <romc215> the power of friendship
[2:11:30] <+tempestzephyr> hatch
[2:11:35] <historynutjackson> @ComfortableStranger Heard that's quite a good game.
[2:11:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So Pat how many hours do you have then, like 60ish
[2:11:41] <%Jekado> FLASH
[2:11:41] <%bassoontyphoon> I mean how many people does Leon actually save
[2:11:42] <%Aleate> tfuKEK
[2:11:42] <@SoFarFetched> DID IT AAAGGGAAIINNN
[2:11:45] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlind
[2:11:46] <krabthecrab> DBD is for cool alphas, ME is for lame RP nerdos
[2:11:47] <+w4rhe4rt_> got em
[2:11:47] <%The_Grey_Ghost> The_Grey_Ghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat you gonna check out chaos since it seems Chaos is fixed?
[2:11:51] <%ComfortableStranger> @historynutjackson so far its great
[2:11:52] <historynutjackson> @ComfortableStranger Correction, I've heard it was updated and patched INTO a good game
[2:11:53] <Jokobeast> What a weird stun overlay.
[2:11:54] <%rDAKODAc> Man… I do not understand this game
[2:12:07] <ChocolateMoofin> Is there lore for this game?
[2:12:16] <mattmmkay> kind of?
[2:12:17] <%CoffeeKaiju> yep
[2:12:23] <magboost> kinda Chocolate
[2:12:26] <%Aleate> Almost far too much lore lol
[2:12:28] <%bassoontyphoon> @chocolatemoofin a bunch
[2:12:29] <Pookiedaexzile> I got no problem with DBD, but the  viewer counter did when I said that
[2:12:30] <DestroyerPhoenix> the hatch can only be used when there's one person left if they don't have a key
[2:12:31] <krabthecrab> Barely. Mostly just background stories for the killers
[2:12:35] <%ComfortableStranger> @historynutjackson yeah I bought it after the suggestion from doc on the podcast
[2:12:40] <%BarujaraciGaming> @chocolatemoofin yes the horror movies its based on
[2:12:40] <romc215> beware the nemesis hand dong
[2:12:41] <+cascadepersona> Poor Jill
[2:12:46] <Sol_Install> cause they know wher ethe hatch is
[2:12:46] <magboost> but its mostly set in a mode where the Lore doesn't matter
[2:12:49] <SaltyAzteca> Just like ol times eh Jill? MVGame
[2:12:50] <%DianaTheAscian> hes waiting by the hatch watch
[2:12:50] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:12:51] <VentWilsn> jill sacrificed for leon sad
[2:12:54] <%DianaTheAscian> nevermind
[2:12:55] <%Monkeyweed21> THE HATCH
[2:12:56] <DestroyerPhoenix> tfuEvil
[2:12:59] <@SoFarFetched> TL;DR survivors & killers get "summoned" to the entity's realm where the survivors must forever try to escape while the killers serve the entity forever to give it sacrifices. @ChocolateMoofin
[2:13:03] <+vaultzombie> sussy baka vent
[2:13:04] <%Aleate> 2% speed buff from NOED lets goooo
[2:13:04] <HaroldDonchee> that fucking sucks lol
[2:13:05] <mattmmkay> either end is gonna be hard
[2:13:06] <historynutjackson> @ComfortableStranger  I enjoyed Doc. He was  a good guest
[2:13:11] <+Grayhammatter> SICK
[2:13:14] <mattmmkay> nemmie is really slow too
[2:13:16] <%toolofparanoia> fuckem up
[2:13:17] <%GarbageNirvana> *notices ur hatch* owo wats this
[2:13:18] <ChocolateMoofin> Thanks all!
[2:13:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Doc was a very good guest.
[2:13:27] <%ComfortableStranger> @historynutjackson me too
[2:13:30] <%QueequegTheater> Is Nemesis a 4.4?
[2:13:31] <+Thunderhawk47> does pat really run NOED what a dick
[2:13:33] <%Mendin> Did you know that Wraith can close a hatch while cloaked?
[2:13:36] <%Mendin> It's hilarious
[2:13:42] <$Ziegsy> @GarbageNirvana Cursed ziegsyNana
[2:13:46] <%AncelDeLambert> they're looking for the hatch, which means they're fucked
[2:13:49] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Nemesis is 4.6 speed
[2:14:01] <Zeif00> I mean this is rank 19
[2:14:02] <$SGrim> @Thunderhawk47 he has no other perks. The character is too new
[2:14:06] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> His tentacle slows him down a little though.
[2:14:06] <VentWilsn> might be hiding near one of them
[2:14:07] <%BoxNavy> got his ass
[2:14:07] <+Grayhammatter> are you though?
[2:14:09] <%CoffeeKaiju> bonk
[2:14:09] <%Anime_Flux> hahahaha
[2:14:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> RIP
[2:14:13] <%Aleate> tfuCry
[2:14:13] <amiavamp> lmao did he really fall for that
[2:14:16] <circular7> damn
[2:14:17] <Grandnatics> gottem
[2:14:20] <%Mendin> The Countdown Timer happened as soon  as the third person died, they should know for a fact that hatch is gone
[2:14:20] <circular7> he tried
[2:14:21] <romc215> Dramatic, until Leon runs into your fist and gets KO'd
[2:14:21] <%ComfortableStranger> which reminds me I still need to play adios
[2:14:23] <VentWilsn> BIGGEST RIP OF THE NIGHT
[2:14:24] <MonsieurCreamy> NOED is not dramatic tho
[2:14:25] <Sol_Install> Nice~
[2:14:25] <+chiazam> welp
[2:14:28] <+NerevaRising> Are ya winning Pat?
[2:14:30] <Link232> Fuckin' NOED
[2:14:30] <@commanderclaw> But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[2:14:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Ooooof
[2:14:35] <%Aleate> He was so cute tfuCry
[2:14:47] <romc215> Domination

[2:22:24] <peachy996> Suck Fummer
[2:22:25] <SpaceGuntank> my AC stopped working yesterday, i live in texas and its 92 degrees in my house right now...
[2:22:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Summer can suck a fat one
[2:22:26] <+vaultzombie> It's the actual worst season
[2:22:26] <wolfen091> just don't leave basement
[2:22:26] <Profmcstevie> I like Spring, I am not a fan of summer
[2:22:26] <%Pandybun> Me too
[2:22:27] <%YakumoYomi> Agreed. I love winter.
[2:22:27] <%SvenHolgersson> Fall is superior
[2:22:28] <leinadtonu> Are the bugs hot?
[2:22:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Do you have ticks in montreal?
[2:22:28] <SaltyAzteca> Sounds like a normal day in the tropics LUL
[2:22:29] <Pookiedaexzile> FALL AN WINTER ARE KINGS
[2:22:29] <%SvenHolgersson> The best season
[2:22:30] <balthazar758> summer PunOko
[2:22:30] <DeepPix3l> Literally all year in FL
[2:22:30] <%WhereIsWill> fall is the truth
[2:22:30] <VentWilsn> u know, watching him stare into the camera live is a lot different than the VOD
[2:22:31] <%Nekros4442> Heatmiser can kiss my ass
[2:22:31] <+Okashido> One of my favorite parts of ME3 is that you can shoot double throws. It's super fun.
[2:22:32] <stantheman_97> spring is where it's at
[2:22:32] <%ItalianWaifu> pretty bullshit blazing
[2:22:33] <$SGrim> Summer is #1. Then again, I'm a teacher.
[2:22:33] <Decarcassor> We need to kill summer
[2:22:33] <+trackles_64> winter has cold
[2:22:34] <%QueequegTheater> It is 40C and 60% humidity tonight
[2:22:36] <peachy996> I want everything to be cold and dark forever
[2:22:38] <Dabrikishaw> This summer is worse because its Cicada season.
[2:22:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Fall and Winter are the only months
[2:22:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Winter has cold and death, and?
[2:22:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Summer is when my air turns orange from all the fires
[2:22:42] <+OmegaWeltall> Spring = Fall> Summer>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Winter
[2:22:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Canada is fucking hot
[2:22:43] <%Piemono> And the Sun, which is anti-Pat
[2:22:43] <mak0t0yukii> Who is crazy enough to love summer
[2:22:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I live in Missouri, you don't know heat
[2:22:52] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Summer has hurricanes and wild fires
[2:22:52] <firewhiskeys> huge chunks of canada can break 100F
[2:22:54] <tanarath> Montreal isn't great
[2:22:56] <%ComfortableStranger> I used to live in Sacramento, a 6 month summer with temps of to 115f
[2:22:59] <%QueequegTheater> Montreal doesn't get humid though
[2:23:00] <historynutjackson> I live in Seattle and it doesn't get super hot but I also don't have air conditioning at all D:
[2:23:00] <%Pandybun> What's the temperature over there?
[2:23:00] <magboost> Wait shouldn't living in the cold make pat weaker to heat?
[2:23:02] <Vantesla> What is "hot" LUL
[2:23:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> How's the humidity in Montreal?
[2:23:02] <%SaiyanShoto> But how long does it stay hot for?
[2:23:03] <%Dfreddy8> Manitoba goes from +40 to -40
[2:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> that's what you get for living next to an inland sea
[2:23:04] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Cool thing about ME3 I just learned. In LE you can find the Multiplayer weapons in the campaign now
[2:23:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Winter fucking sucks. I said it
[2:23:05] <+Lulu19> dumb chat
[2:23:05] <%QueequegTheater> Humidity is the real killer
[2:23:06] <tolloponik> sounds like Georgia
[2:23:08] <romc215> yeah, but winter means snow and having to shovel said snow which brings back and leg pain
[2:23:13] <+barrakuta371> I prefer Summer over spring, as Spring makes my allergies go haywire and I'm miserable for like 3-4 months.
[2:23:13] <ingman112> Montreal, more like “not real”
[2:23:16] <peachy996> I'd rather be cold than sweat my ASS off
[2:23:18] <+Lulu19> mtl and nyc have similar weather
[2:23:18] <%bassoontyphoon> The Great Lakes region of Canada has absurd humidity levels
[2:23:19] <$KnivesEve> pat can absolutely complain about cold though
[2:23:21] <+BIumen> yeah but hot in fake units isnt really hot
[2:23:23] <tanarath> @thomasoftroy high with over 100 temps
[2:23:24] <%ape_hawk> hi no signal!!!
[2:23:24] <magboost> gotta remember heat is relative

[2:23:25] <CurrySauseBandit> 43c in Arizoba. Fuck you all.
[2:23:25] <leinadtonu> I heard that if you die in Canada you die in real life.
[2:23:26] <+Grayhammatter> Yea!
[2:23:28] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> wow my favorite
[2:23:29] <Profmcstevie> If the heat can be a threat to life, it's too hot
[2:23:30] <TomFrancis_> PogChamp No signal
[2:23:31] <stantheman_97> YAAAAAAAAY
[2:23:32] <SpaceGuntank> on top of it being ridiculously hot in texas again, the rumor going around is that the power grid might fail again
[2:23:37] <stantheman_97> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:23:37] <Pookiedaexzile> IF you can survive the test of the shovel, you don't deserve the death of the wintr
[2:23:39] <+Grayhammatter> no signal is the best mass effect
[2:23:39] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Same in Russia. Moscow has summers of 40+ C

[2:26:12] <%QueequegTheater> Zaeed is an old Martin Walker isekai'ed into Mass Effect, prove me wrong
[2:26:13] <historynutjackson> @bassoontyphoon You are absolutely correct. Jack is terrible.
[2:26:18] <peachy996> Bah Grunt and Jack are some of my fav members of the squad

[2:26:29] <%templar010> 2
[2:26:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> wow that was a fast ME2 stream
[2:26:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is the shit, only the weak are scared by her

[2:26:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Good stream
[2:26:47] <peachy996> If you removed Kasumi and traded Jacob with Zaeed, you'd have a perfect 10
[2:26:49] <%AncelDeLambert> only two humans are worth hanging around: Joker, and Chakwas

[2:27:03] <+Grayhammatter> nice stream, pack it up, go home everybody
[2:27:06] <%ComfortableStranger> do you think TIM really wanted you to grab Okeer, or was the plan to get Grunt all along?
[2:27:14] <%QueequegTheater> @historynutjackson exactly
[2:27:17] <aiutare47> I think people tend to also forget Kaiden's lore, which while not as cool as most others, is still way better than Ashley's. He killed his master in a fit of rage like a canadian anime protag
[2:27:19] <%ComfortableStranger> @AncelDeLambert kasumi was cool
[2:27:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Jacob Replaced with Zaheed, and Jack in Mirandas spot
[2:27:27] <SpaceGuntank> jack is fine in 2 after she warms up to you but in 3 man she's GREAT
[2:27:39] <%BarujaraciGaming> @comfortablestranger there was never any plan, only CHAOS
[2:27:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Actually mixing Jack and Mirandas back stories would make them both complete characters
[2:27:42] <+trackles_64> switch to amd
[2:27:43] <akitanito> perfect
[2:27:43] <%SvenHolgersson> nice

[2:27:51] <+Grayhammatter> perfect
[2:27:55] <%Gamblitz> Your Drivers became passengers of your suffering
[2:27:56] <peachy996> Okeer was the priority remember you can just GIVE Grunt to The Illusive Man
[2:27:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Kasumi is nothing
[2:27:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did you sync your V?

[2:28:18] <Profmcstevie> ....is saying Shepard cheating
[2:28:18] <Dabrikishaw> My favorite human sqaudmate is Miranda
[2:28:19] <%shadowsofpain> Zaeed and Kasumi are both great
[2:28:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Man, a week from now Chaos is going to be fucking nothing
[2:28:21] <%machshop> vega sucks and is lame
[2:28:22] <ScreamLord> Kasumi
[2:28:24] <$Futurecity10> Kasumi easy
[2:28:25] <%Xelhesia> chakwas or joker
[2:28:25] <%bassoontyphoon> Kasumi
[2:28:26] <Pookiedaexzile> 4 Letters
[2:28:27] <stantheman_97> zaeed seems cool
[2:28:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Vega is a himbimbo
[2:28:29] <%AncelDeLambert> ew, realyl?
[2:28:30] <%Garthunox> Vega
[2:28:30] <peachy996> Vega is okay
[2:28:30] <%afronooch> james is good, but thats 3
[2:28:30] <%HitchhikingThrough> That seems unfair to vega
[2:28:30] <%valriot> LUL
[2:28:31] <%DizzyGunner> vega is so fucking boring
[2:28:31] <+MidnightBurst12> ...
[2:28:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Get the fuck outta here
[2:28:33] <+DaCharliebruh> A lowly tarnished, playing as a Lord?
[2:28:33] <%Arancet> you havent played me3!
[2:28:33] <+OmegaWeltall> yea i'd have to say Vega too
[2:28:33] <%dd44dostivei> lol
[2:28:34] <aiutare47> Vega is boring
[2:28:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kasumi
[2:28:34] <Zalapski> I mean Miranda is most useful in fights
[2:28:34] <wolfen091> yes
[2:28:34] <%I4gotmyname89> LUL
[2:28:35] <%HitchhikingThrough> Like I don't disagree
[2:28:35] <asylumkon> vega is beffy kaiden
[2:28:36] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Vega is actually cool
[2:28:38] <+Grayhammatter> who the fuck is vega?
[2:28:38] <%ComfortableStranger> please tell me you're joking
[2:28:40] <%ape_hawk> you havent met vega yet, dude
[2:28:40] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a meatslab with a rifle
[2:28:40] <%StaceMcGate> Joker and Chakwas aren't squadmates
[2:28:41] <ScreamLord> Vega is just a discount Krogan
[2:28:42] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt did you select "clean install"?
[2:28:43] <%Bt_Robot> But Zaheed!
[2:28:44] <peachy996> Vega is better than Kaiden and Jacob
[2:28:45] <%QueequegTheater> Vega is great, he's a big dumb CoD character who's just along for the ride
[2:28:45] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:28:45] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah Vega is alright
[2:28:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> Vega is better than Kaiden and Jacob.
[2:28:46] <SaltyAzteca> THATS RIGHT
[2:28:46] <Vantesla> LUL
[2:28:49] <%AzureGale> vaj
[2:28:50] <%SvenHolgersson> FAIR
[2:28:51] <akitanito> no time to taint your views huh
[2:28:51] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Vega is a bro to the end
[2:28:52] <%dd44dostivei> he's a satire of GoW players
[2:28:53] <MarylandJutsu> Wrong Pat, Kasumi is best
[2:28:53] <aiutare47> He's just dumb and says spanish words because ethnic
[2:28:54] <+Ghufufin> joker with mods
[2:28:55] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:28:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vega is good
[2:28:57] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:28:57] <lloyddboy> JACK IS RIGHT THERE
[2:28:57] <%bassoontyphoon> That’s fair
[2:28:58] <Yuroshi> I think thats the right answer
[2:28:58] <%Bt_Robot> Old man is best
[2:28:58] <Profmcstevie> He is safe by virtue of ignorance
[2:28:58] <+D00msDayDan> vega is the least worst human
[2:28:59] <historynutjackson> LUL
[2:29:00] <%IamGrapes> I think Vega is an actually good character
[2:29:01] <%AzureGale> va-guh
[2:29:03] <%ComfortableStranger> Iron bull VO
[2:29:05] <peachy996> Vega was the male human squadmate done better than the previous two attempts
[2:29:05] <TourettesPlays> Who's Vega? You mean Big McLargehuge?
[2:29:10] <%IamGrapes> has a movie about him and everything
[2:29:13] <Grandnatics> He's not terrible
[2:29:15] <Grandnatics> By comparison
[2:29:17] <ingman112> Remember he doesn’t know 3 at all
[2:29:17] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Vega is the Krogan "replacement".
[2:29:17] <ScreamLord> Joker in power armor would be THE best
[2:29:22] <%QueequegTheater> Vega pulls some absurdly dangerous shit to help Shepard, he's great
[2:29:24] <aiutare47> always get heavy weapon ammo so you can get the Cain as soon as possible
[2:29:25] <+amaranthos> Is it ok to be racist against vorcha
[2:29:26] <+chester804> Jack gets her own thing too
[2:29:26] <%kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! OH GOD IM OOOOOLLLDDDD
[2:29:28] <Dabrikishaw> James Vega is a good character, people just dump on him because he's introduced to you in the final game.
[2:29:30] <%NopeBadguy> some team members get their own upgrades. Grunt gets his own weapon.
[2:29:34] <%DizzyGunner> kaiden, boring. ashley, boring, james, boring. jacob, boring. all the entry human suad mates are terrible
[2:29:34] <%Garthunox> @TourettesPlays Uh, its Tough McHugeBod
[2:29:34] <%StaceMcGate> Discount Wrex
[2:29:35] <%valriot> Shepard
[2:29:35] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye
[2:29:36] <thetunnelhomer> Beef Stroganoff.
[2:29:37] <$hattrick61> of the 3 jacobs hes the best
[2:29:37] <%NopeBadguy> I don't think you can get grunt yet?
[2:29:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mordin deserves his own thing.
[2:29:39] <Vantesla> Vega isn't much better than Kaiden. Just more "renegade" and a soldier/new guy.
[2:29:41] <peachy996> Grunt? Don't you mean Warlord Okeer Kappa
[2:29:41] <Broken_Sonex> Vega is better than Kaiden AND Jacob by default.
[2:29:42] <%NopeBadguy> Oh wait you can
[2:29:43] <Pookiedaexzile> People refuse to like jack because somebody invented "edge" in like 2015
[2:29:43] <SpaceGuntank> James Vega aka Slab Bulkhead
[2:29:46] <Pookiedaexzile> as insult
[2:29:46] <historynutjackson> @ScreamLord But running over a rock would shatter his legs. Being in power armor doesn't stop that
[2:29:48] <+LeftHandedHeather> I was very frightened that I just hopped into a chat that was badmouthing Vega, phew
[2:29:50] <thetunnelhomer> Grunt is the best.
[2:29:54] <$SGrim> @TourettesPlays His name is pronounced Dorito el'Gigante
[2:29:55] <%QueequegTheater> @amaranthos is it okay to say all bulldogs are dumb
[2:29:55] <thetunnelhomer> Because he is baby
[2:29:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Vantesla Vega has an actual personality.
[2:29:58] <Grandnatics> Vega is a meathead who recognizes he's dropped onto a crew of weirdos and he has nothing going on about himself
[2:29:59] <%ComfortableStranger> vega is a dudebro
[2:30:00] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays Wait no I remember his name is Ace Hardware
[2:30:00] <%BarujaraciGaming> oh man I'm having ME3 flashbacks of how terrible the Normandy layout is
[2:30:06] <%machshop> Vega isn't "introduced" he's just there already
[2:30:06] <ingman112> I fucking love Jack and it’s 100 percent because of bias
[2:30:11] <%DizzyGunner> don't you mean okeer? Kappa
[2:30:13] <aiutare47> Cain lets you just instant win long and annoying fights, getting it should be a priority if you hate boss fights
[2:30:16] <+sermittens> WREX
[2:30:16] <MayorRev> did pat do the probing uranus joke yet
[2:30:20] <%NateyBeak> no joke every time I see this game I have to re-remember jacob exists. he is so boring he is schrodingers teammate
[2:30:20] <+Punchasaur> dorito borgia
[2:30:28] <thetunnelhomer> Jack is great, but only because she gets a huge glow up in ME3
[2:30:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Kasumi > Zaeed = Vega >>>>> Miranda = Kaiden >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Jacob = Ashley
[2:30:34] <+trackles_64> jCob
[2:30:34] <+D00msDayDan> that is a aaaaaaaaaalien
[2:30:35] <+Grayhammatter> ayyyyy liens
[2:30:37] <SaltyAzteca> Garrus "Best Wingman" Vakarian
[2:30:38] <%condemned_15> that's an aaaaaaaalien
[2:30:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat's favorite human crew member is himself :)
[2:30:41] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Take Zaeed, he's basically a Krogan himself
[2:30:41] <%StaceMcGate> the horribly broken DLC gun?
[2:30:44] <%NopeBadguy> Try Kasumi at some point, she's super good. @PatStaresAt
[2:30:47] <%ExpressNode> No humans allowed
[2:30:49] <Dabrikishaw> Like, people assume James has anything to do with Call of Duty because they judge books by their cover.
[2:30:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @MayorRev you don't do that until Arrival
[2:30:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Humans aren't allowed to leave the sip, that's da rules.
[2:30:51] <peachy996> Does Mordin have anything unique to say here?
[2:30:53] <willyfreshness> It is hard to not put Mordin on EVERY mission
[2:30:56] <%ComfortableStranger> evis is good and is hitscan
[2:31:01] <%DizzyGunner> DLC guns in 2 are so busted
[2:31:01] <thetunnelhomer> Hand canon is all you need really.
[2:31:02] <%ape_hawk> @bassoontyphoon wheres jack in this tier list?
[2:31:04] <%StaceMcGate> he used Kasumi multiple missions
[2:31:06] <peachy996> Korlus is a great mission
[2:31:08] <wolfen091> only has 3 shots then reload ugh
[2:31:09] <SpaceGuntank> i'm a M-300 Claymore man myself
[2:31:14] <ChocolateMoofin> Have you decided who you're romancing yet? I've been catching up with vods but not this far yet
[2:31:17] <TourettesPlays> Holy shit Pat your character looks so stupid
[2:31:19] <Dabrikishaw> @willyfreshness It's actually easy for me, because I don't use Mordin nearly at all
[2:31:19] <%Arancet> god pat shep is hideous
[2:31:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Which shotgun was the shotgun you had to be a krogan to use or else it broke your arm
[2:31:20] <%QueequegTheater> @Dabrikishaw he has the design and personality of Soap MacTavish
[2:31:21] <%machshop> that visor lmao
[2:31:21] <akitanito> yeah
[2:31:23] <peachy996> Fuckin Jedore
[2:31:26] <$hattrick61> Crusader GOAT
[2:31:27] <Vantesla> @commandersqueaks Debatable. Much can just be because of Freddy voice acting and delivery. He is supposed to be a insert for players that didn't play the prior games. I recall from an old dev talk way back SeemsGood
[2:31:29] <+Grayhammatter> yes, yes you do
[2:31:29] <Grandnatics> But the Geth shotgun is so fun!
[2:31:29] <Broken_Sonex> @bassoontyphoon Jack is a tryhard.
[2:31:30] <+Ghufufin> Eggsheperd, Eggperd
[2:31:30] <%SvenHolgersson> How far in is this?
[2:31:32] <%BarujaraciGaming> pat your hat looks stupid
[2:31:32] <%QueequegTheater> OH MY GOD
[2:31:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I think I never play without the Scouter
[2:31:34] <historynutjackson> Mordin is so fucking good.  Especially the showtunes
[2:31:35] <%QueequegTheater> HIS FACE
[2:31:36] <%Pandybun> I love you Garrus
[2:31:36] <%ape_hawk> you DO look like a gym teacher, yeah
[2:31:37] <stantheman_97> he looks like such a stupid cunt
[2:31:38] <OtakuSnake1> FutureManBalding
[2:31:39] <+Punchasaur> cool facebook ver
[2:31:42] <%Varlinator> Garrus YOU should be on that speaker!
[2:31:47] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt you look like bald Cyclops
[2:31:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> did pat take garrus into the quarantine zone
[2:31:52] <akitanito> just wear the helmet and never show the face
[2:31:54] <peachy996> Jack may be a tryhard but she's still better than Kasumi
[2:31:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is.... a sixth through the game. Ish.
[2:31:56] <%ape_hawk> oh yeah, pat has the two tech bois
[2:32:00] <Grandnatics> Garrus has the best comments on this mission
[2:32:01] <akitanito> he did
[2:32:01] <TourettesPlays> @stantheman_97 makes sense since thats what paragon shep really is
[2:32:02] <ScreamLord> Eviserator is probably the 2nd best shotgun after the Geath shotty if you don't get the Claymore
[2:32:02] <historynutjackson> @ThatGuyfromMars yep
[2:32:03] <%NopeBadguy> Garrus covers shields, Mordin covers armor
[2:32:11] <%dd44dostivei> this looks like the thanos planet
[2:32:14] <viewtifulr> OPTIC blast!
[2:32:15] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat You may want to rebind your short cuts

[2:32:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> why is pat robocop in medical colored armor
[2:32:23] <Vantesla> Zaeed and Kasumi I like though they get the least amount of time/development.
[2:32:23] <MayorRev> 90% of you looks like a badass, the remaining 10% looks like you need your bone medicine
[2:32:24] <TourettesPlays> Just you wait for those Cryo detonations in ME3 Pat
[2:32:26] <+Peacefrog7> did you do the SR1 quest yet?

[2:36:38] <Broken_Sonex> Paragon in ME2 is just Renegade in ME1.
[2:36:41] <Vantesla> Again Shepard Paragon in 2 vs enemies is being a dick. Being Renegade is just brutality ironmouseKEK LUL
[2:36:44] <ScreamLord> So many war crimes in one fight
[2:36:48] <%dd44dostivei> ooooooooooooo "i got my fanny filled"
[2:36:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh nice
[2:36:56] <Grandnatics> Pat what's your opinion on the higher difficulties?
[2:37:04] <SaltyAzteca> REPPUKEN
[2:37:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> that ability is super good
[2:37:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shepard, I can't believe your mom lets you have TWO war crimes.
[2:37:12] <%GarbageNirvana> More games should let you be a mean paragon
[2:37:13] <+vaultzombie> It do go up!
[2:37:16] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Were you talking to yer AI teammates or us, PAt?
[2:37:16] <%ape_hawk> Vibing with Dr. Warcrimes and Bad Cop
[2:37:18] <peachy996> Nice shot
[2:37:19] <SaltyAzteca> PULL!
[2:37:19] <AthenaAegis> EleGiggle
[2:37:21] <%StaceMcGate> ME2 plays best on Insane, but for streaming purposes normal is fine
[2:37:22] <akitanito> that poor guy
[2:37:22] <stantheman_97> NICE!
[2:37:26] <%Pandybun> I just realized there's no mini map in ME2
[2:37:31] <%QueequegTheater> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:37:33] <+senfood> Skeet shooting people is the best.
[2:37:36] <%ComfortableStranger> notice the sound effect for shockwave is way different than me3
[2:37:40] <+Grayhammatter> aaaaaaaaaa
[2:37:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> man the Mattock sounds so damn meaty

[2:38:06] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Sexy bone-cat
[2:38:09] <%Pandybun> Aww. Pat wuvs Garrus
[2:38:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah reloading the same spot twenty times because you didn't execute a perfect maneuver through it doesn't make for compelling streaming
[2:38:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> @ComfortableStranger plus in me3 your shockwave is generated by a PUNCH
[2:38:15] <Profmcstevie> Mordin, looking good OSFrog
[2:38:22] <stormhawk9891> @ComfortableStranger It's also not a reppuken in 3
[2:38:35] <%logoth_> SCRATCH ONE
[2:38:35] <%QueequegTheater> Bobby Kotick needs those offworlders DEAD
[2:38:36] <Esperflame> It's the Brogan!
[2:38:37] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Kill him, pat
[2:38:37] <SaphronBlackbourne> Told Garrus wanted to sex him last night

[2:38:56] <%Gamblitz> Krogan Helmets are so cool
[2:38:57] <MayorRev> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED
[2:38:58] <peachy996> Right in the chest
[2:39:02] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> He wants you bad
[2:39:02] <%ComfortableStranger> @aWanderingKaivo  wasn't it an open palm?
[2:39:04] <peachy996> Funnier with Femshep
[2:39:06] <%dekkitout> He talks pretty
[2:39:07] <Zalapski> personal space pls
[2:39:13] <%Pandybun> @Pandybun Yeah I'm playing it for the first time and I'm still learning
[2:39:15] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL
[2:39:18] <akitanito> old enough to talk
[2:39:19] <%Ranryu692> sup Worf
[2:39:21] <%BarujaraciGaming> those tank grown krogans....I dunno, they're a little.......FISHY TO ME 😉
[2:39:23] <Dabrikishaw> Shepard commands instant respect
[2:39:24] <Grandnatics> This is Grunt's brother
[2:39:26] <BlackStarAura> I love him
[2:39:27] <%ape_hawk> Bread... to kill
[2:39:35] <Pookiedaexzile> You're not the son, We're taking home
[2:39:36] <+senfood> The Krogan have really had it rough.
[2:39:38] <%machshop> glass mom
[2:39:39] <Pookiedaexzile> We aren't adopting you
[2:39:41] <%condemned_15> NO HONOR
[2:39:43] <%SvenHolgersson> DON'T THROW STONES IN THE GLASS WOMB
[2:39:44] <Broken_Sonex> GLASS MOMTHER
[2:39:48] <peachy996> It does sound like Worf when he says Glass Mother
[2:39:49] <+senfood> GLASS MOTHER
[2:39:51] <+Grayhammatter> glass mother
[2:39:53] <%aWanderingKaivo> @ComfortableStranger maybe? or that might be the Adept melee
[2:39:53] <%DianaTheAscian> Glass mother sounds kinda rad
[2:39:55] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like you should bump up to hardcore just so you actually have to deal with protection on enemies since that's where gameplay really gets fun
[2:40:02] <peachy996> I don't know if he voices this Krogan
[2:40:08] <LeotheHuntsman> wait is this Worf?
[2:40:11] <%ComfortableStranger> glass mother, sounds like the gara warframe
[2:40:15] <%CatastropheCorvid> IS THAT MOTHERFUCKING WORF?
[2:40:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> not along the ground though
[2:40:18] <dashmatt> This voice has no honor!
[2:40:18] <%BubbaRands> These Krogon sound pretty Klingon to me LUL
[2:40:20] <%Gamblitz> God made him of course
[2:40:21] <peachy996> But Dorn is in this game
[2:40:25] <Pookiedaexzile> It might be
[2:40:27] <ovan20> that audio lag LUL
[2:40:27] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL Why don't you say goo-goo ga-ga?
[2:40:34] <%StaceMcGate> Michael Dorn voices another Krogan
[2:40:35] <%DianaTheAscian> is it?
[2:40:37] <Zalapski> same
[2:40:39] <BlackStarAura> HE IS PERFECT
[2:40:40] <+senfood> I want to hug him.
[2:40:43] <%ape_hawk> is he potty trained, too
[2:40:44] <Ner234> FeelsBadMan
[2:40:46] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's either Dorn or the guy who voiced Marcus in NV.
[2:40:49] <SaltyAzteca> Youre perfect to me BibleThump
[2:40:56] <+senfood> TANK-GROWN KROGAN IS MOE.
[2:40:58] <MayorRev> :(
[2:41:00] <SpaceGuntank> l love Mordin but i never really brought him along, its nice to hear his take on things.
[2:41:03] <%Aleate> "I am not perfect" I relate to this unnamed Krogan tfuCry
[2:41:05] <BlackStarAura> COME TO THE SHIP
[2:41:05] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Aw, yeeeeah
[2:41:05] <%SvenHolgersson> JUST LIKE MY REAL DAD
[2:41:06] <+Grayhammatter> the glass father
[2:41:07] <%ComfortableStranger> "glad he's on ourside"
[2:41:07] <Holofono> oof too real
[2:41:08] <Pookiedaexzile> This is one calm son, Monk like Thought full
[2:41:08] <ChocolateMoofin> This sounds lime me. lol
[2:41:08] <%bread_assassin> ME2 coulda used a hide helmet option.
[2:41:10] <%Gamblitz> Gatatog Uvenk
[2:41:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> MORDIN HATES THAT.
[2:41:16] <+senfood> I WANT TO MAMORU TANK-GROWN KROGAN
[2:41:18] <akitanito> imagine holding a newborn and say "you've failed meeeee"
[2:41:24] <BlackStarAura> ADOPT HIM PAT
[2:41:24] <%snow_bush> Where did it get its armor and guns?
[2:41:25] <%ape_hawk> this is the liquid snake of krogans
[2:41:25] <Broken_Sonex> "I don't know but i am not perfect." THAT'S a fucking mood
[2:41:26] <%DianaTheAscian> TANK MOM
[2:41:27] <peachy996> Yeah Worf voices Uvenk later on

[2:41:38] <$hattrick61> i wish this guy showed jp again
[2:41:41] <MayorRev> BibleThump
[2:41:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> @bread_assassin wish they added that in LE, since it exists in ME1 and ME3
[2:41:57] <Josef_Stryker> Can we keep him?
[2:41:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Grunt is voiced by Steven Blum/
[2:41:59] <+trackles_64> the hoomans
[2:42:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Is Uvenk the dude you headbutt or the bad dude
[2:42:01] <%Gamblitz> Its like Invader Zim
[2:42:05] <%YakumoYomi> Krogans are so fucking cool
[2:42:05] <+Grayhammatter> thanks bud
[2:42:06] <+senfood> I love him so goddamn much.
[2:42:08] <%miguelrod777> wish we kept him too
[2:42:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't worry MayorRev We'll get a better one
[2:42:14] <TourettesPlays> He wanders off to parts unknown where he still wanders to his day
[2:42:14] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> This guy's all right SeemsGood
[2:42:14] <BlackStarAura> I WANT TO TAKE HIM HOME AND PUT HIM IN MY BATHTUB
[2:42:15] <peachy996> We never know what happens to this guy
[2:42:16] <SaltyAzteca> CRACK DAT NECK
[2:42:17] <shotgang86> it was blocking NOTHING
[2:42:19] <$hattrick61> Take him, give grunt an older brother
[2:42:21] <Esperflame> Not til after he opens up the path at least
[2:42:23] <stantheman_97> i love him
[2:42:24] <shotgang86> that thing was already open
[2:42:24] <%walternatorz> you wish you were an Elcor
[2:42:28] <%Aleate> God I wish I had 4 balls- what?
[2:42:28] <akitanito> would you rather be krogan or salarian
[2:42:35] <%NopeBadguy> kinda wish there was a mass effect mmo then i remember the old republic and think again
[2:42:36] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Is Gief part krogan?
[2:42:42] <%SvenHolgersson> WORDS TO LIVE BY
[2:42:49] <akitanito> gief is elcor
[2:42:53] <%YakumoYomi> Was his helmet bugging out?
[2:42:53] <%SvenHolgersson> "I am not perfect but I have purpose"
[2:42:53] <%KaiserMario> ME4 needs a scene where a barrel breaks a Krogan's back
[2:42:56] <+trackles_64> so just starves to death?
[2:42:56] <Grandnatics> RIP
[2:42:57] <SaltyAzteca> I feel bad for it, forever stuck within the voice
[2:43:00] <BlackStarAura> NOO DON’T GO
[2:43:00] <stantheman_97> poor baby krogan
[2:43:03] <%tank7013> "I must wait for Reunion"
[2:43:04] <knight_verse> Man, creepy uncle ShepPat looks like an asshole with that visor... it's perfect.
[2:43:04] <%Piemono> Born to Die
[2:43:05] <%StaceMcGate> ok Quiton Flynn
[2:43:06] <akitanito> did he just call you a krogan
[2:43:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Samurai Krogan is one of the best unnamed characters
[2:43:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> nothing like the good ole elbow into shotgun combo
[2:43:17] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Whoops I set the auto-aim to "Woolie"
[2:43:25] <$Clarke1010> What difficulty is Pat on?
[2:43:30] <peachy996> Oh man I remember this section
[2:43:37] <+senfood> Krogan culture can be summarized by the phrase "I'm still alive, motherfucker. I'm still alive."
[2:43:40] <akitanito> that baby punch kill
[2:43:41] <%ComfortableStranger> enemies won't ragdoll till the armor and shields are down
[2:43:42] <jorniev> IM SORRY PAT i forgot you were streaming and missed you playing
[2:43:48] <Broken_Sonex> @QueequegTheater That's a good one, i like that
[2:43:49] <%MelBrooksKA> "Run for your life, there crazy! But first we have to shoot these unrelated people!"
[2:43:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow, spicy
[2:44:00] <Esperflame> Boop the snoot!
[2:44:00] <jorniev> what has pat done this stream?
[2:44:03] <ExemplarKyle> Krogan Shotgun + Vanguard is so busted but so fun
[2:44:07] <TourettesPlays> God remember ME1 where you would get one shot by Carnage from all the way across the room
[2:44:09] <MayorRev> boop
[2:44:18] <Dunmarkh> @jorniev dead by daylight
[2:44:24] <MayorRev> can't you switch shoulders in this?
[2:44:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> boop the snoot
[2:44:29] <akitanito> all you need is boop
[2:44:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> krogan snoot is in booping range
[2:44:34] <%Gamblitz> booping krogan what a world
[2:44:37] <$hattrick61> no
[2:44:37] <MayorRev> peeking left corners over right shoulder is pain
[2:44:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogan Just sees a Bald redhead  rush head first into them
[2:44:40] <%ComfortableStranger> me3 vanguard is twice as good as me3 vanguard
[2:44:41] <shotgang86> and I oop
[2:44:43] <TourettesPlays> @MayorRev not in any of them
[2:44:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> nope that was just in Andromeda
[2:44:45] <peachy996> No
[2:44:50] <%ComfortableStranger> *me2
[2:44:52] <%QueequegTheater> Having the character on the right side is terrible though
[2:44:55] <MayorRev> bleeehhhhh
[2:44:57] <peachy996> In Andromeda ironically you can
[2:44:57] <+Grayhammatter> 2000 platinum, more than enough to buy anything in warframe
[2:44:58] <jorniev> @jorniev the dlc? and? did he like it?
[2:45:01] <Esperflame> The heavies are shitting their pants at the moment.
[2:45:04] <MayorRev> feels like a third person shooter requirement for me
[2:45:07] <%Dakuu75> Damn, I just got off work. Guessing he did the Nemesis shit all ready
[2:45:09] <$SGrim> @ComfortableStranger but which one?
[2:45:14] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Hack-master
[2:45:23] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[2:45:24] <jorniev> a KROGAN vanguard would be fucking scary
[2:45:29] <%Dakuu75> Dakuu75 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:45:30] <%QueequegTheater> Do it again
[2:45:30] <%DizzyGunner> one of the best things they did in me3 was getting rid of the hacking mini games
[2:45:33] <+Grayhammatter> da hack master
[2:45:33] <+CoolZ619> CoolZ619 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:45:37] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> You would have been fucked
[2:45:41] <%ComfortableStranger> 3>2
[2:45:43] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Soft lock
[2:45:45] <$hattrick61> isnt wrex a vanguard
[2:45:45] <%bread_assassin> @jorniev Isn't that just Wrex?
[2:45:47] <$SGrim> @jorniev me3 multiplayer proves that right away.
[2:45:48] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> required doors dont get locked out luckily
[2:45:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Most Krogan Biotics are Vangaurds
[2:45:59] <%ComfortableStranger> @hattrick61 yes
[2:46:01] <%NopeBadguy> wrex is technically a vanguard but he doesnt have charge
[2:46:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jorniev and you can be one in ME3's multiplayer!
[2:46:02] <%QueequegTheater> No, Wrex is a Krogan Battlemaster
[2:46:05] <Pookiedaexzile> And its brutal
[2:46:06] <ExemplarKyle> @jorniev That's basically the Krogan Warlord class in ME3's multiplayer. It's brutal, and crazy fun.
[2:46:07] <%Dakuu75> I like how pat walks in the room like "What going on here?"
[2:46:11] <SpaceGuntank> Wrex's class is Vanguard, but his charge is physical, not biotic.
[2:46:12] <SaltyAzteca> Wilheim scream be like
[2:46:15] <BlackStarAura> That damned scientist lady from Virmire is coming up
[2:46:16] <$SGrim> @hattrick61 he's a battlemaster, which means he has biotics, but different powers.
[2:46:22] <jorniev> @bread_assassin WREX accelerating at you at breakneck speeds
[2:46:26] <%king_wragles> That's breakable cover
[2:46:32] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt How did you know you wanted to romance Garrus in the past?
[2:46:33] <%ComfortableStranger> kro vangaurd was one of the most used solo kits
[2:46:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Did I miss anything important or just fighting?
[2:46:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> playing krogan in the multiplayer is so fun, they are just constantly laughing happily throughout combat
[2:46:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes, Wrex is a vanguard, because vanguard isn't a in game word
[2:46:50] <peachy996> I preferred Krogan Soldier
[2:46:55] <MayorRev> Pat theyre having trouble shooting your bald head, its too shiny
[2:47:00] <peachy996> More shit to burn and headbutt
[2:47:01] <TourettesPlays> Curving incinerate and cryo blast around corners in 3 is Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:47:03] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Wrex is a Krogan poop-baby
[2:47:11] <%StaceMcGate> surviving two rockets without shields
[2:47:12] <%logoth_> SCRATCH ONE
[2:47:19] <%BarujaraciGaming> pat stop almost dying, geez
[2:47:20] <%ComfortableStranger> @aWanderingKaivo loved to go melee soldier build
[2:47:24] <%DizzyGunner> you should be chargin there to get your shields back
[2:47:26] <viewtifulr> Missale Barrage dooddoom
[2:47:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> biotic charge is sometimes risky
[2:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat: "Nerf This"
[2:47:45] <%NopeBadguy> he just had to calibrate his flesh wounds he'll be fine
[2:47:50] <TourettesPlays> @ThatGuyfromMars NEVER
[2:47:55] <ExemplarKyle> Krogan Shotgun + melee reload glitch = BROKEN in this game. Makes even Insanity a joke.
[2:47:59] <%ComfortableStranger> also krogan warlord sentinal had a hammer that was fun and powerful as hell
[2:48:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Biotic Charge is never a Risk
[2:48:08] <$renegade_blade> I recently finished playing through me2 legendary and forgot this game doesn't really have sniper enemies like me1 and me3
[2:48:09] <Pookiedaexzile> It is only a opprotunity
[2:48:10] <%DizzyGunner> the only time biotic charge is annoying is when your mashing the button to get shields back and the game just says no
[2:48:10] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Hack-Master Pat
[2:48:17] <%mikeriffic> have a problem? Biotic charge it!
[2:48:25] <%NopeBadguy> @Pookiedaexzile hell no, it'll get you killed if used poorly on hardcore and insanity
[2:48:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> all fun and games until you biotic charge into a crowd of dudes and get shot up
[2:48:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont get cryo it sucks ass
[2:48:42] <peachy996> Lol "Blue Suns!" like you're cool
[2:48:46] <ExemplarKyle> @ComfortableStranger Ah, the biotic hammer. That impact sound is still in my sweetest dreams.
[2:48:46] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> This is fine
[2:48:49] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy...
[2:48:55] <%BarujaraciGaming> pat you're almost dying again
[2:48:58] <TourettesPlays> @renegade_blade yea its like all close and medium range combat arenas, nothing as wide open as 1
[2:49:00] <%NopeBadguy> @Monkeyweed21 THIS IS THE WRONGEST YOU'VE EVER BEEN
[2:49:06] <%mikeriffic> Its finnnne
[2:49:08] <%BarujaraciGaming> hey pat you're almost dead again bro
[2:49:11] <%ComfortableStranger> @ExemplarKyle yuuuuuup
[2:49:11] <%QueequegTheater> Vanguard stronk
[2:49:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> almost dying is fine, just CHARGE
[2:49:14] <%NopeBadguy> CRYO IS BUSTED IN THIS GAME
[2:49:15] <+OmegaWeltall> thats Vanguard
[2:49:16] <%mikeriffic> fucking charge regens those barriers
[2:49:18] <%Dfreddy8> Don't forget Garrus' Overload
[2:49:18] <SovPho> Oh he's figured out how broken Vanguard is.
[2:49:20] <%aWanderingKaivo> know your ABCs
[2:49:21] <%snow_bush> Charge and Shockwve
[2:49:23] <+Grayhammatter> a little dicey, but got through it
[2:49:23] <%mikeriffic> really allows for aggressive play its great
[2:49:24] <SaltyAzteca> This fast and loose style. WutFace
[2:49:24] <Josef_Stryker> MANGUARD
[2:49:25] <+OmegaWeltall> charge shotgun shotgun charge
[2:49:26] <thetunnelhomer> Vanguard is very unga
[2:49:28] <%mikeriffic> really helps in ME3 to
[2:49:29] <LluthyY> The true way to vanguard
[2:49:32] <%toolofparanoia> Vanguard: never stop charging
[2:49:33] <jorniev> MANGUARD
[2:49:34] <%NopeBadguy> charge regens barriers but won't heal health, so be careful @PatStaresAt
[2:49:36] <%snow_bush> Literall that's all you need, just charge and shockwave
[2:49:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Charge is always powerful
[2:49:42] <peachy996> Always Be Charging
[2:49:43] <%mikeriffic> just beat ME3 on insanity with vangaurd, its a great thing
[2:49:43] <SovPho> I did vanguard through ME2 and ME3 it is absolutely busted in 3.
[2:49:46] <%QueequegTheater> Vanguard is basically Sol badguy
[2:49:50] <+DeadlyPeaks> So me, thane, & garrus are sniping it up & 1 shoting most enemies. Was game always this easy?
[2:49:51] <%DizzyGunner> can you set off biotics with charge in 2? i forget
[2:49:53] <Esperflame> Vanguard: Don't stop...believing....
[2:49:53] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> a tip fpr later
[2:49:54] <%mikeriffic> tho me3 isnt fun on insanity...reconnmend harcore instead...
[2:50:03] <TourettesPlays> Overload is so unbelievably OP in 3
[2:50:05] <%shurtal> Man, Patrick Shephard looks like Bill Dautrieve from King of the hIll
[2:50:08] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Pat loves being passive
[2:50:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DizzyGunner iirc Warp is the only detonator in 2
[2:50:13] <%logoth_> F
[2:50:14] <%CalderGaming> CHARRRRRGE
[2:50:23] <Pookiedaexzile> I did Vanguard in 1 and 2, Charge into the middle of the crowd, and find cover,
[2:50:23] <+Tucker0603> lol
[2:50:23] <%mikeriffic> rockets hurt
[2:50:24] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL
[2:50:24] <shotgang86> he ded
[2:50:25] <%NopeBadguy> it's very fun but it'll get you killed if you charge into bad positions
[2:50:25] <%Dfreddy8> CRAZYTALK
[2:50:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:50:27] <%bread_assassin> Does Vanguard work on Insanity in ME2? Charge seems like a fast track to Game Over Town.
[2:50:27] <ExemplarKyle> "This thing is fun to play"
[2:50:28] <%DizzyGunner> @DizzyGunner that sucks
[2:50:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> should have charged HARDER
[2:50:29] <%WhereIsWill> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:50:29] <SwarfegaHead> this is gonna nd in disaster lol
[2:50:30] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> love that ragdoll
[2:50:32] <%QueequegTheater> "Not difficult"
[2:50:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> when you get it down to like a 2 second recharge in ME3 it's trivial
[2:50:33] <%NopeBadguy> you REALLY have to learn to pick priority targets as a vanguard
[2:50:33] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> vanguard go weeeeeeeeeee
[2:50:34] <%OldOnyx> LUL
[2:50:34] <%Gamblitz> this is fu-(dead)
[2:50:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't just stand and bang
[2:50:38] <SpaceGuntank> and therin lies the "high risk high reward" of Vanguard. happens to everyone at least once
[2:50:40] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I charged to much and now my tummy hurts
[2:50:42] <+flexin_apex> Lol
[2:50:44] <+Grayhammatter> this thing is fun to play *dead*
[2:50:44] <AthenaAegis> Kidney punched by rocket
[2:50:44] <%QueequegTheater> Does Mordin have crazy talk
[2:50:45] <peachy996> Too many missiles in the butt
[2:50:45] <tattleworm> the upgrades to vanguard in andromeda almost made it worth playing
[2:50:48] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[2:50:51] <+Tucker0603> I love being big tank man with sentinel
[2:50:52] <%ComfortableStranger> psaCrazyhead
[2:50:54] <shotgang86> maybe not charging INTO the rockets should help
[2:51:02] <Jahomono> big fun
[2:51:03] <peachy996> @SpaceGuntank Gonna happen a lot in Horizon
[2:51:03] <shotgang86> psaHoldon
[2:51:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat I think your problem is you're not Charging enough
[2:51:08] <Pookiedaexzile> You have a cover system, Charge is free
[2:51:09] <SwarfegaHead> vangaurd is so good but this aint it chief.
[2:51:14] <BlackStarAura> These dudes are cheap as hell
[2:51:37] <s1rcuit> @QueequegTheater he only seems crazy, he's probably the most sane person in the game
[2:51:37] <+Grayhammatter> never stop charging
[2:51:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt you also need to think more about priority targets to charge
[2:51:43] <%DizzyGunner> ABC always be chargin
[2:51:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Charge more. Cover More.
[2:51:45] <stantheman_97> never stop going in
[2:51:48] <%mikeriffic> ITs gets better as you get reserch upgrades especialyl cooldown ones Pat
[2:51:49] <%snow_bush> You can blaze through this game even on the highest difficulty as vanguard simply through charge and shockwave
[2:51:51] <Case_Ah_Dia> less thinky moar chargey
[2:51:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Gears of talk
[2:51:53] <%QueequegTheater> @s1rcuit that's not what Crazy Talk means
[2:51:58] <%QueequegTheater> Learn the lore
[2:52:02] <Zalapski> Always Be Charging
[2:52:04] <%mikeriffic> keep up on reserch and you do feel yourself getting stronger for sure
[2:52:06] <akitanito> they don't understand what taking cover means
[2:52:09] <%NopeBadguy> ME2 is basically NEVER leave your class exclusive on CD
[2:52:17] <Case_Ah_Dia> never stop not stopping
[2:52:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Now cover
[2:52:27] <CrypticMochi> A bigger stronger charge peen would help too
[2:52:38] <jorniev> I wish characters had lines about your fighting style and class
[2:52:39] <%QueequegTheater> Fast many bullets = shields
[2:52:42] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> What's that weird gun on the left?
[2:52:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> just tanking a missile like it's nothing
[2:52:44] <karl_rex> I really liked that they expaned on the power combos in 3 from 2
[2:52:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> and blackholes
[2:52:47] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Rocket launcher?
[2:52:52] <TourettesPlays> Every SMG except locust is pretty bad tbh
[2:53:00] <%mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt when you can get assault rifle training use the mattock, you can just zoom and pew pew people down
[2:53:00] <%NopeBadguy> It's not super important to think about on Normal. Protection is rarer on Normal, but becomes common on Hardcore and Insane.
[2:53:08] <%QueequegTheater> AHHHH MY HEAD
[2:53:08] <KeiPrime> AAAHH
[2:53:09] <mattmmkay> is me2 the best in the series, in your opinion?
[2:53:09] <%Shubreaker> AAAA

[2:53:10] <Ner234> LUL
[2:53:13] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:53:15] <+Tucker0603> I do prefer the change to tech armor in 3, straight damage reduction
[2:53:15] <%walternatorz> concentrate on my agggggghhhh
[2:53:17] <stantheman_97> AHHHH
[2:53:21] <+OmegaWeltall> the locust is SOO busted
[2:53:27] <viewtifulr> lytBODIED AAA
[2:53:27] <%ComfortableStranger> @jorniev some of the krogan enemies say "how about using a real gun" "shotgun? nice!
[2:53:29] <%Pandybun> How do you do that puzzle?
[2:53:32] <Zalapski> "He must have died while writing it."
[2:53:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> ME2 has the best story but ME3 has the most refined combat
[2:53:35] <tmj2k> Do you enjoy the KOTOR influence on this game?
[2:53:36] <Pookiedaexzile> It feels good to play with the bad gun and to play risky
[2:53:37] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> rgtThink rgtThink rgtThink
[2:53:38] <%athuramn> playing games for fun? madness
[2:53:41] <%DizzyGunner> im currently 30hrs into me3 and man the pistol you get in the citidel DLC is so broken
[2:53:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> tempest isn't that bad but is super inaccurate outside of short range
[2:53:43] <romc215> Sentinel is OP thanks to Tech Armor in ME2. You basically become invincible with it
[2:53:44] <+Tucker0603> locust is long range delete
[2:53:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> and you get it late
[2:53:49] <%king_wragles> @Pandybun match the code to the one at the top, it changes when you get it right
[2:53:50] <SpaceGuntank> if the locust had just a slightly bigger magazine it would be perfect
[2:53:52] <SaphronBlackbourne> I usually use the Locust and Collector Assault Rifle
[2:53:53] <%QueequegTheater> Imagine having fun
[2:54:00] <%athuramn> @dizzygunner yeah, it's busted
[2:54:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> locust is a pocket AR
[2:54:03] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> the Geth SMG in 3 with extended mag and %chance to not use ammo is lots of fun
[2:54:08] <%PatNTheHat> Always Be Charging. Don't Ever Forget: Going Hard Increases Jerks Killed Like Morons, Naturally
[2:54:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Especially since weapons are no longer locked by class in 3, you can use any ol' gun you want
[2:54:11] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt I believe ammo type also effect shields and armor. Like fire burns off armor or something to that effect
[2:54:12] <mattmmkay> do you think they're going to release more?
[2:54:18] <mattmmkay> remastering it and all
[2:54:19] <%walternatorz> Mordin is a baaad man
[2:54:20] <peachy996> I love that Jedore talks so much shit she annoys her own people
[2:54:28] <%ape_hawk> you thought it was a bad man but instead it was a dr warcrimes
[2:54:31] <%ComfortableStranger> locus is a headshot machine
[2:54:33] <%NopeBadguy> well mordin DID commit a war crime with the genophage
[2:54:35] <%NopeBadguy> so he's KINDA a bad man
[2:54:37] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Mordan Bad-Person
[2:54:39] <%Pandybun> @king_wragles I don't know why but for some reason I couldn't tell the difference between them all D:
[2:54:44] <%Ravioli_Ronin> More Dan and Gary
[2:54:49] <SaltyAzteca> The ladies with the launchers are brutal
[2:54:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> yup, incendiary armor does more damage to armor, plus more damage + burning to health
[2:54:53] <mattmmkay> This is where I have limited information because I only played a little bit of Me3
[2:54:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> ammo*
[2:54:57] <%QueequegTheater> @NopeBadguy not a war crime
[2:54:58] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> MORE CHARGES
[2:55:01] <TourettesPlays> The coveriest cover shooter
[2:55:03] <viewtifulr> Mordan said sorry later on :(
[2:55:08] <thetunnelhomer> Wait, did that rocket do a left turn
[2:55:09] <%PatNTheHat> Mordin didn't do the genophage himself, genophage was done hundreds of years ago IIRC
[2:55:09] <Pookiedaexzile> When the game play so good you start looking to see if you can get ME2 in Legendary only
[2:55:18] <mattmmkay> that's kind of what I don't like about it
[2:55:20] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 she tells them "what am i paying you for?"
[2:55:23] <%king_wragles> @king_wragles Pay attention to the colors for the most part, and then the shapes. You'll catch on
[2:55:23] <mattmmkay> most of the time you're taking cover
[2:55:26] <ExemplarKyle> Now that I think about it, are any of the crew vanguards aside from Shepard?
[2:55:29] <%StaceMcGate> would've been a perfect spot for your Heavy Weapon
[2:55:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mordin only UPGRADED the genophage
[2:55:33] <thetunnelhomer> Mordin made sure the genophage kept working
[2:55:39] <TourettesPlays> @PatNTheHat he perpetuates it since the Krogan develop an immunity to it as generations go on

[2:55:54] <%patriotrenegade> Use your bald spot to deflect enemy fire
[2:55:55] <peachy996> Put your balls away Shepherd
[2:55:56] <%athuramn> maybe a bit
[2:55:56] <+barrakuta371> just a smidge ballsy
[2:55:56] <+Grayhammatter> you think?
[2:55:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> give em the shepard's elbow
[2:55:58] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Smother them with your huge balls

[2:56:01] <%Dfreddy8> Balls with No Balls Boivin
[2:56:02] <+Tucker0603> charge
[2:56:02] <%Pandybun> @king_wragles Gotcha. I'll remember that when I get up to it
[2:56:05] <SpaceGuntank> yeah, also remember that Charge's auto lock is a little fucky. its sometimes better to target using the power wheel
[2:56:06] <KaitlynnHere> He didn’t even die
[2:56:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> your balls got too close to the rocket
[2:56:11] <%StaceMcGate> you can punch or shoot a black hole at them Pat
[2:56:14] <Afterman_> vanguards can die?
[2:56:16] <%QueequegTheater> Pat's plan was to use Heavenly Pot Buster until it worked
[2:56:16] <%walternatorz> imagine a human torpedoing towards you to only land at your feet, punching you as bloody corpse
[2:56:17] <%ComfortableStranger> the fourth evolution ups shield restore to 100%
[2:56:20] <stantheman_97> imagine seeing your enemy tank like 3 rockets to the face and be fine
[2:56:23] <SwarfegaHead> use the throwy floaty power. its good
[2:56:23] <KaitlynnHere> You were playing like Paige
[2:56:24] <ExemplarKyle> "Someone get her off the speakers and out here" Me to every bad boss I've ever had
[2:56:25] <KeiPrime> i forget can he change ammo type? i mean fire isnt for shields its for armor rite?

[2:56:48] <peachy996> Getting spanked
[2:56:48] <%walternatorz> they learned that rockets are good against person
[2:56:48] <@commanderclaw> Use Brain
[2:56:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> charging dudes with shields is always a bad idea
[2:56:48] <+Tucker0603> vanguard: always be charging
[2:56:49] <+Grayhammatter> bold move cotton, it did not pay off
[2:56:49] <SpaceGuntank> vanguard's two biggest enemies are Rockets and Flamethrowers
[2:56:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> @KeiPrime yeah but the only other ammo vanguard has is cryo, nothing for shields
[2:57:00] <peachy996> And it's not even by sexy aliens either
[2:57:01] <James_Quivers> Pat just charge more and you won
[2:57:01] <GustauveVIII> charge people who are in good cover spots
[2:57:03] <%Dfreddy8> WHAT A SHAME
[2:57:03] <TourettesPlays> Eviscerator is top 10 video game sound effects I will never forget, ive heard it thousands of times
[2:57:05] <MrPandastic> Pat's too used to being a immortal god with the barrier ability
[2:57:05] <+Tucker0603> sentinel: be tanky, do combo
[2:57:12] <%athuramn> @spaceguntank that seems like a big enemy for the average person
[2:57:12] <%ComfortableStranger> he's playing like Paige, charge in without looking or thinking
[2:57:23] <Pookiedaexzile> No, CHARGE PEOPLE IN GOOD COVER AND STEAL IT
[2:57:31] <Afterman_> how are adepts in ME2/3? I am playing one in mass effect 1 and might keep it up. always used to be vanguard
[2:57:31] <KaitlynnHere> Be careful pat, if you keep playing like that you’ll unlock the easy mode again
[2:57:33] <Pookiedaexzile> "I wanna be there"
[2:57:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Brute Smarts!
[2:57:37] <MayorRev> PSA: tekken is 3
[2:57:38] <KeiPrime> ok good to know @aWanderingKaivo
[2:57:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh shit you have pull unlocked? pull is GREAT on this level
[2:57:51] <%ComfortableStranger> @CommanderSqueaks yup!
[2:57:53] <%PatNTheHat> Hiding behind cover? This is not how you play the Pinball Wizard
[2:57:57] <BlackStarAura> God, Garrus and Mordin are so quick to die
[2:58:04] <TourettesPlays> A Vanguard denied of his charge BibleThump BibleThump
[2:58:08] <peachy996> I gave my Adept in 3 one of the Biotic powers from the Omega DLC. She was fun
[2:58:13] <romc215> Charge in and give them "The Shepard's Elbow!" It's like the people's elbow, but it's Shepard and in space
[2:58:13] <+gafien> Has pat talked at all about the blue box games / silent hill tweet?
[2:58:15] <%StaceMcGate> one heavy weapon shot would end these groups as they are all crowded together
[2:58:15] <%QueequegTheater> Pat loves cowardice too much to be a true Vanguard
[2:58:20] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt aim pull uppwards more so it angles steeper and can go over cover
[2:58:24] <Pookiedaexzile> See how the people flanking you have good cover, and are above the others
[2:58:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @BlackStarAura the ai isn't great
[2:58:27] <SpaceGuntank> @Afterman_ better in every upgrade, biotic combos are insane in 3
[2:58:29] <ExemplarKyle> @Afterman_ Fun in ME2, OP in ME3 if you run a cooldown-based build
[2:58:34] <Pookiedaexzile> You charge them, and shoot down at the other group
[2:58:35] <peachy996> Adept isn't bad it's just....Vanguard tho
[2:58:38] <SwarfegaHead> aim highre
[2:58:48] <Afterman_> @SpaceGuntank  @ExemplarKyle Nice. might keep it since I
[2:58:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> they have to just be on health though
[2:58:55] <Afterman_> 've never done an adept full play thru*
[2:59:09] <%StaceMcGate> it doesn't work if they have shields/armor/barrier
[2:59:11] <SwarfegaHead> floaty power is best power. think you get damage bonuses when theyr suspended too
[2:59:17] <ExemplarKyle> That biotic explosion sound effect when you pull off a combo as an Adept in 2 and 3 is just -chef kiss-
[2:59:26] <%ComfortableStranger> biotic combos are more powerful and easier in 3 so I don't use adept till then
[2:59:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Target first
[2:59:42] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Make sure you're autolocked on the guy, then aim a bit up
[2:59:43] <+D00msDayDan> turn the camera while you have the wheel up
[2:59:46] <mattmmkay> is the alien the guy that voices fry?
[2:59:47] <%ComfortableStranger> aim as high as you can while maintaining the lock
[2:59:51] <Afterman_> i think it has some curve to it, so just toss it further
[2:59:51] <%Shubreaker> biotics don't lift if your target has armor/shields
[2:59:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt just make sure they are highlighted but aim as high as you can while they are still highlighted
[2:59:54] <akitanito> long range boop
[2:59:54] <SpaceGuntank> just make sure not to bring along any strong biotics partners if you're running Adept, because it creates redundancy.
[2:59:55] <SwarfegaHead> look at the guy then aim up. you can angle it around cover and shit
[3:00:04] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It may also be better to do it using the power wheel
[3:00:06] <%athuramn> if you're having trouble, adjusting aim sensitivity might help
[3:00:07] <+EmptyMug> It can only be arced so much
[3:00:08] <Afterman_> arc it
[3:00:13] <TourettesPlays> @ExemplarKyle more partial to the Cryo detonation but biotics have a nice bubbliness to them
[3:00:21] <Dunmarkh> time to git gud
[3:00:21] <%QueequegTheater> Curve the bullet
[3:00:23] <SpaceGuntank> use the power wheel to lock on and then toss it
[3:00:31] <LluthyY> aim up while the target marker is still on the enemy and itll curve to them

[3:02:29] <$Futurecity10> she gets indoctrinated in 3 and commits terrorism
[3:02:32] <Dunmarkh> she's using fucking indoctrination on the tube babies?

[3:02:57] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> lol mordin holy shit
[3:02:57] <Grandnatics> But why
[3:02:58] <SwarfegaHead> Gotta go do eugenics somewhere else real quick
[3:02:58] <aiutare47> Even mordin is like "ice her dude
[3:02:58] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah Mordin gets it LUL
[3:02:58] <ExemplarKyle> RIGHT, MORDIN
[3:03:00] <SovPho> that's the joke
[3:03:00] <+senfood> THANK YOU MORDN
[3:03:00] <Pookiedaexzile> YOu mean like you Mordie
[3:03:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> Mordin LOVES murder
[3:03:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is He WRONG tho?
[3:03:03] <peachy996> Mordin is right
[3:03:03] <%DEETRz> gdi mordin
[3:03:03] <James_Quivers> HE'S SUPER RIGHT
[3:03:04] <jorniev> DAMN MORDIN
[3:03:04] <%ComfortableStranger> projecting mordin?
[3:03:04] <akitanito> but he's right
[3:03:04] <Dunmarkh> he's right tho
[3:03:05] <mighty_fine_trousers> How long has been playing ME tonight?
[3:03:05] <%QueequegTheater> No no, he's got a point
[3:03:05] <+CursedNobleman> and it WORKS
[3:03:05] <%king_wragles> WAS HE WRONG?
[3:03:06] <+keyoray> Hypocrit?
[3:03:07] <Josef_Stryker> He's not wrong tho
[3:03:08] <viewtifulr> feisty
[3:03:08] <SaltyAzteca> CANT TATTLE IF THEY DEAD
[3:03:08] <%spartanghost004> He is right
[3:03:08] <romc215> Mordin is right, he is your moral compass
[3:03:09] <+senfood> HE'S RIGHT THO
[3:03:10] <ExemplarKyle> He's right tho
[3:03:10] <arduousScavenger> "Because it WORKS, SHEPARD!"
[3:03:11] <ovan20> it's a permanent solution LUL
[3:03:12] <%Shubreaker> it's a good solution
[3:03:12] <iosephe> HE'S NOT WRONG
[3:03:14] <%Pandybun> Mordin just wants to experiment on her
[3:03:15] <SovPho> Mordin also has too much knowledge without ethical boundaries
[3:03:15] <mattmmkay> aliens have higher iqs
[3:03:15] <karl_rex> Mordin read the script
[3:03:19] <Pookiedaexzile> He's Right....but he's also RIGHT ABOUT HIMSELF
[3:03:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He's extremely right, Rana is indoctrinated
[3:03:20] <Wolfstriker121> HES NOT WRONG LOL
[3:03:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is the SECOND time you found this lady doing unethical bullshit.
[3:03:22] <KeiPrime> the hypocratic oath doesnt exist in SPACE
[3:03:22] <thehullowed> !uptime
[3:03:22] <%pokefan9956> pat change your title
[3:03:22] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[3:03:24] <jorniev> I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU TO MORE MISSIONS MORDIN
[3:03:30] <BinaryShuffle> stripYan
[3:03:32] <%Piemono> Mordin's ethical boundaries are pretty questionable though
[3:03:33] <%ape_hawk> you could say its his... final solution
[3:03:34] <peachy996> Fair enough
[3:03:37] <BlackStarAura> She kills people in 3
[3:03:38] <mattmmkay> kill him
[3:03:39] <%DizzyGunner> "no your not wrong mordin, you're just an asshole"
[3:03:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love Okeer's voice
[3:03:42] <James_Quivers> TANK SON
[3:03:42] <Broken_Sonex> "KNOWS TOO MUCH!" *I N H A L E* "NEED TO KILL"
[3:03:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Everybody dies in 3, don't worry
[3:03:44] <KeiPrime> at the same time, its 3
[3:03:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Sup dude
[3:03:46] <Profmcstevie> We live freely, to make our own mistakes
[3:03:48] <Afterman_> dave fennoy!
[3:03:52] <peachy996> Okeer is a cool Krogan to talk to
[3:03:58] <tattleworm> if you killed her there's no event and the only downside is a bad news article, it doesn't even effect your galactic readiness or whatever
[3:03:59] <RobTheBlessed> is playing on insanity?
[3:04:03] <%ComfortableStranger> "but I approve!"
[3:04:04] <%NopeBadguy> OH BOY A STANDARD KROGAN NPC MY FAVORITE SQUAD ADDITION
[3:04:04] <SwarfegaHead> not a bad hacking minigame, seeing in now in the year of our lord 2021
[3:04:04] <aiutare47> its not an event, its a piece of text and number goes down
[3:04:07] <%QueequegTheater> ...Fair
[3:04:08] <RobTheBlessed> pat*
[3:04:09] <peachy996> "I am creating the ubermensch"
[3:04:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Warf?
[3:04:16] <mattmmkay> kill him. he seems evil
[3:04:17] <+MidnightBurst12> He's not wrong
[3:04:31] <jorniev> I HOPE we get to meet a new krogan scientist in the new game
[3:04:38] <%ComfortableStranger> not michael dorn
[3:04:43] <peachy996> Oh yeah Garrus and Mordin are right there LUL
[3:04:47] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Pong krell?
[3:04:50] <+EmptyMug> Hmm, I wonder if generic Krogan #3 will join us or the nice fancy unique one in the tank?
[3:04:51] <BinaryShuffle> He's a damn good storyteller
[3:04:52] <BlackStarAura> GENTLE?!
[3:04:58] <blackjack8182> Krogan Lee
[3:04:59] <%PhantomMiG> Oh Gentle Genocide thats a term
[3:05:01] <SaltyAzteca> Hah, turians and salarians, Like garrus and mordin, hah
[3:05:08] <%ape_hawk> i mean, krogan WERE throwing asteroids at planets during the rebellion, soooooooo
[3:05:08] <%maenos2> grunt is great but okeer is kinda cool
[3:05:08] <Pookiedaexzile> "I'm Fixing the disease you put in my people because you couldn't beat us in the fight you started after forcing us to kill your big roach problem"
[3:05:10] <Afterman_> @BinaryShuffle considering his VA.. it helps
[3:05:16] <%QueequegTheater> @BlackStarAura more gentle than gunning them down in the streets
[3:05:17] <DementedJackyl> It’s weird how I haven’t played the first one in 13 years yet I still remember this mission
[3:05:18] <James_Quivers> Okeer wants that ARYAN KROGAN
[3:05:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> quantity is a quality all its own
[3:05:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Wait is that fucking Lee from Walking Dead
[3:05:33] <ExemplarKyle> On paper, the genophage is actually gentle. But because of the constant in-fighting, it bordered genocide.
[3:05:34] <Broken_Sonex> @PhantomMiG It makes it more scary...
[3:05:36] <peachy996> Okeer is a guy I wish we spent more time with. Kinda like Nihlus in ME1
[3:05:37] <%ComfortableStranger> @PatStaresAt Sun tzu disagrees
[3:05:45] <Afterman_> goddamn
[3:05:45] <SaltyAzteca> I got a Megatron vibe just now LUL
[3:05:47] <Afterman_> thats a good line
[3:05:49] <KeiPrime> best boi
[3:05:49] <RobTheBlessed> Anyone know what difficulty is he playing on?
[3:05:52] <%walternatorz> he's dope
[3:05:55] <Grandnatics> But he's not even a biotic!
[3:05:57] <%pokefan9956> this guy is rad
[3:05:58] <romc215> He's cray cray
[3:05:58] <+senfood> That's a reallly good line, goddamn.
[3:05:58] <peachy996> He's literally creating the Krogan ubermensch
[3:06:01] <%SvenHolgersson> So it's Krogan
[3:06:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Got it
[3:06:06] <viewtifulr> stupid but mad probs
[3:06:07] <no123450n> like squashing a hornet nest with your hand

[3:06:20] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 6m.
[3:06:21] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S SO STUPID IT'S COOL
[3:06:22] <SpaceGuntank> PURE KROGAN
[3:06:23] <stantheman_97> krogan is gonna krogan
[3:06:26] <mattmmkay> he's talking genocide
[3:06:27] <dashmatt> I guess this is Sparta?
[3:06:27] <mattmmkay> kill him
[3:06:29] <SkinnyRite> Doesn't Okeer sound like Lee from Walking Dead
[3:06:30] <Afterman_> gek from no man sky are just tiny krogan...
[3:06:30] <%QueequegTheater> A PERFECT RACE
[3:06:32] <slix3431> Pat you gotta stop him from putting stuff in the water making the Krogan gay
[3:06:33] <RobTheBlessed> thx @satans_finest_millennial
[3:06:34] <ExemplarKyle> He's right though. Jedore is a shit commander. Just barking orders through a loudspeaker and not on the front lines.
[3:06:34] <BlackStarAura> I love you Grunt
[3:06:43] <dashmatt> Toss those krogan off a cliff
[3:06:43] <%pokefan9956> based?
[3:06:47] <%dekkitout> Does he share the same va as Pong Fucking Krell?
[3:06:48] <MoonKing> EUGENICS LETS GOOOOOOO
[3:06:53] <peachy996> Okeer has great lines
[3:06:53] <Pookiedaexzile> "He is the perfect son"
[3:06:54] <%Gamblitz> Okeer wants Krogan 2.0
[3:06:57] <$lotharrio> Okeer, please call my son by his given name.
[3:06:57] <%ComfortableStranger> @ExemplarKyle so like most american bosses
[3:07:00] <%QueequegTheater> In other words, Grunt is a Dragoon
[3:07:01] <Afterman_> @dekkitout  yes. it is dave fennoy
[3:07:01] <%DianaTheAscian> THATS A GOOD LINE
[3:07:02] <slix3431> Pat wtf is on your face?
[3:07:02] <Pookiedaexzile> HOW
[3:07:02] <%DEETRz> he's really well written
[3:07:05] <Pookiedaexzile> HOW SHEPARD
[3:07:09] <%DizzyGunner> fun fact: okeer is voice acted by dave fenoy, rodin in beyp
[3:07:09] <Broken_Sonex> Actually BASED
[3:07:10] <Pookiedaexzile> No it isn't
[3:07:13] <+Chimeraelite> smart dude
[3:07:14] <Dabrikishaw> Okeer would honestly be a good squadmate for 2
[3:07:15] <Pookiedaexzile> They slaughtered a people
[3:07:15] <jorniev> god we are probably going to meet grunts descendants  if he made it in 3
[3:07:17] <ExemplarKyle> @ComfortableStranger Sadly, you are absolutely not wrong.
[3:07:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Isn't this literally Varys' plan in FFXIV
[3:07:31] <%dekkitout> The Miranda of Krogans
[3:07:32] <jorniev> ADVANCED RACE THEORY
[3:07:34] <+senfood> Jesus, this script rules.
[3:07:40] <%42nfl19> yay?
[3:07:44] <mattmmkay> I like how his speech is so scripted, he can just run through it
[3:07:47] <arduousScavenger> "I will name this perfect Krogan MIRANDA!"
[3:07:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Grunt pops out but he's just Urien.
[3:07:53] <Dabrikishaw> Okeer's ideal is to use the Genophage to cull weak Krogan
[3:07:58] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jorniev maybe even Grunt himself, no krogan has died of old age
[3:07:59] <Broken_Sonex> KROGAN MEASUREHEAD

[3:08:28] <Pookiedaexzile> See how hard they have to work to bend him back to evil
[3:08:29] <%pokefan9956> booba
[3:08:30] <falyden> krogan shrugged
[3:08:31] <ianabstract> so he's not a boob man
[3:08:31] <%walternatorz> LUL
[3:08:31] <akitanito> not being able to see shepard's eye is not great
[3:08:32] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:08:32] <mattmmkay> break the ice
[3:08:33] <aiutare47> The genophage didnt go far enough!
[3:08:33] <KeiPrime> all the human booby
[3:08:34] <SaltyAzteca> STONEWALL
[3:08:36] <karl_rex> He hates boobs he deserves to die
[3:08:36] <mattmmkay> and befriend him
[3:08:37] <mighty_fine_trousers> Like the one child policy?
[3:08:37] <romc215> Hey, don't knock the collective human teats
[3:08:40] <%gitgouda> shep is BOILING inside
[3:08:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> collective human teats is a great line
[3:08:45] <M0untain_wolf> That Visor
[3:08:49] <James_Quivers> Okeer say 'The genophage is BASED'
[3:08:50] <Zalapski> "...and the potato-obsessed Volus."
[3:08:50] <M0untain_wolf> Fits so well
[3:08:55] <Zebroneath> Wow Shepard

[3:09:11] <SpaceGuntank> oh no not the GAS!
[3:09:13] <Josef_Stryker> WELP
[3:09:13] <%42nfl19> So is he talking Eugenics? Evolution?
[3:09:13] <Broken_Sonex> What about the collective human buttocks?
[3:09:14] <%StaceMcGate> Jedore looks like a Karen
[3:09:14] <peachy996> Oh Jedore looking pretty good in this
[3:09:20] <mattmmkay> Okeer?
[3:09:20] <satans_finest_millennial> Okeer wants to breed like hippos
[3:09:20] <BlackStarAura> Grunt is so pretty
[3:09:21] <peachy996> Looks like my old Femshep
[3:09:23] <CrypticMochi> You think he practiced his speech while Shepard smashed his way through?
[3:09:29] <+butterick> ooh la la
[3:09:29] <mattmmkay> I thought you were just saying ok like cardi b
[3:09:34] <+CursedNobleman> This is Lee from walking dead yeah?
[3:09:35] <+SilverDevilfish> Okeer wants to make Krogan Kira Yamato
[3:09:40] <mattmmkay> oh, his name is okeer
[3:09:43] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S THE BOY
[3:09:44] <M0untain_wolf> PURE

[3:09:48] <Pookiedaexzile> THE SON MUST LIVE

[3:11:53] <%Gamblitz> Okeer is a very old name... a very hated name....
[3:11:58] <ScreamLord> Dramatic Finish
[3:12:05] <%ComfortableStranger> @Broken_Sonex a very hated name
[3:12:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Go back up
[3:12:09] <ExemplarKyle> @SpaceGuntank The YMIR mech basically nukes itself on death. So, yes.
[3:12:19] <Zalapski> she recommended haste FeelsBadMan
[3:12:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> But Make HAAASTE
[3:12:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Party members with pistols have a bad habit of switching to them after cutscenes where they actually pull them, so be aware of that
[3:12:29] <M0untain_wolf> Not timed
[3:12:33] <RobTheBlessed> does pat allow tips?
[3:12:39] <M0untain_wolf> you're good
[3:12:39] <SovPho> ME2 is the only game where time matters lol
[3:12:40] <Essixian> I forget in what order things happen in this game, has he found
[3:12:43] <Essixian> *Legion yet
[3:12:43] <satans_finest_millennial> eclipse, deeking all the throws is fun
[3:12:44] <mattmmkay> I don't see any contamination
[3:12:44] <romc215> Ah, yes, the post-battle looting and item scramble. It's a time honored tradition
[3:12:51] <mattmmkay> so you're probably fine
[3:13:11] <jorniev> i love that MATTOCK rifle
[3:13:12] <M0untain_wolf> Mattok is good
[3:13:14] <dashmatt> That bitch is dead
[3:13:21] <M0untain_wolf> Grunt!!
[3:13:24] <SpaceGuntank> @Essixian Legion cant be obtained until the VERY VERY end of the game.
[3:13:27] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump 7
[3:13:28] <thelonechris> F
[3:13:29] <peachy996> Bye Okeer
[3:13:29] <+Grayhammatter> Grunt!
[3:13:30] <M0untain_wolf> PERFECT!!
[3:13:32] <+NeonLight> And we shall name him "Perfect"
[3:13:32] <mak0t0yukii> Oh noooo
[3:13:33] <%demiiluna> And he's still 100% inferior to Wrex in every way.
[3:13:35] <ExemplarKyle> G R U N T
[3:13:39] <RobTheBlessed> @patstaresat there's a upgrade item in that room
[3:13:40] <mighty_fine_trousers> Isn't there a full auto mattock in 3?
[3:13:44] <%shurtal> Space Toddler, acquired!

[3:13:47] <+CursedNobleman> suck my human teats okeer LUL
[3:13:48] <arduousScavenger> "This grunt, I will call him SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG!"
[3:13:49] <romc215> No tea bagging... what a shame
[3:13:49] <%NopeBadguy> I know he's supposed to be collapsing but it looks like he's just getting sucked through the floor LUL
[3:13:51] <Pookiedaexzile> He was bluffing and knew nothing
[3:13:54] <$lotharrio> He loved his son.
[3:13:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @demiiluna That's like comparing a mortal to a god.
[3:13:57] <%MisterRockett> That means the game mechanically makes them switch weapons for cutscenes.
[3:13:57] <peachy996> It's nuts you can hand him off to Cerberus
[3:13:58] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah
[3:14:00] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Don't forget the upgrade inside Okeer's room.
[3:14:01] <RobTheBlessed> yes
[3:14:02] <SovPho> Hot take, it would be low-key humbling that the Reapers select humans for their next installment.
[3:14:04] <SpaceGuntank> super krogan get
[3:14:07] <%NopeBadguy> It's a Krogan endurance upgrade @PatStaresAt

[3:15:00] <RobTheBlessed> @patstaresat at some point in the game you can buy the stuff you missed

[3:16:11] <$SGrim> Jacob's so boring, he didn't even have a line to end the conversation.
[3:16:11] <ExemplarKyle> What good is an egg if you can't crack it open and drink it's juices
[3:16:11] <Grandnatics> Miranda and Grunt are the same thing!

[3:16:40] <M0untain_wolf> Damn Commnies
[3:16:43] <peachy996> Nah Grunt isn't the Bionic Man because he was built not rebuilt
[3:16:49] <+senfood> Man, fuck the Reds.
[3:16:49] <%dd44dostivei> renegade shep gives a shit-eating grin to miranda when you threaten to vent the hold

[3:17:08] <thelonechris> A herd of fuckin' ugly reds
[3:17:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, you are okay
[3:17:09] <%mikeriffic> it will only hurt you if you were on insanity anyway
[3:17:12] <%CalderGaming> stop asking chat about these things if you really care
[3:17:12] <thetunnelhomer> I think you can get it on Mordin's Loyalty mission
[3:17:12] <aiutare47> Its a shit upgrade for a squadmate youll hardly use
[3:17:14] <%mikeriffic> and there are redundant ones
[3:17:17] <Strigiform> seems like ME3 had a missed upgrade buy system
[3:17:18] <%DianaTheAscian> THE GOBLINS ARE GROWING LARGER
[3:17:19] <M0untain_wolf> off stream it
[3:17:20] <slix3431> OCD won't let him wait
[3:17:20] <%bevyrage> I'm reading two ways to get it. One is in the same room as Okeer and the other is during the Mordin Loyalty Mission
[3:17:24] <%Varlinator> There's 2
[3:17:24] <%mikeriffic> so you will still get max upgrades by the end of the game
[3:17:26] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt It's also on Tuchanka
[3:17:26] <Dabrikishaw> Oh, sorry, you can't get the Krogan Vit that way
[3:17:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't give into the Goblins Pat.
[3:17:29] <MayorRev> GOBLIN MODE
[3:17:29] <mikesumusprime> you can
[3:17:31] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt its like a 10% increase to his health recovery, you're fine
[3:17:37] <Tyonidus> Do it Pat! Do a big video game!
[3:17:39] <mikesumusprime> googling
[3:17:41] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt and chat, what happens if you choose to never open that jar with Grunt? How does that affect the story?
[3:17:45] <%Varlinator> Yeah, that was 1 of 2
[3:17:47] <%Pandybun> @peachy996 Oh gotcha. Thank you for the clarification
[3:17:48] <%Ranryu692> it's fine, this game is easy
[3:17:49] <%mikeriffic> We been telling you this pat
[3:17:49] <+SilverDevilfish> If only there was some sort of editor... of the save you could use Kappa

[3:17:57] <Pookiedaexzile> 1 of 2
[3:17:57] <%mikeriffic> YES
[3:17:59] <RushUnplugged> don't "missed" upgrades show up in stores anyway
[3:18:01] <%demiiluna> According to the Wiki, you can get it on Mordin's loyalty mission.
[3:18:01] <+chronopaladin> pat's gonna miss all of them
[3:18:02] <TheMostAverageGamer4> redo off stream
[3:18:02] <Grandnatics> If you do loyalty for Mordin you'll be good
[3:18:05] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt What did you miss?
[3:18:06] <peachy996> @42nfl19 It doesn't. He just never shows up
[3:18:10] <%Gamblitz> do it
[3:18:10] <Dabrikishaw> @42nfl19 Gets replaced in 3 with Urdnot Dagg.

[3:18:50] <%SvenHolgersson> It's just bigger number
[3:18:51] <%dekkitout> You'll never know what it'll be like with it if you don't psaGoblin
[3:18:52] <aiutare47> Pat if you got it, youd likely not even spend the resources on it, its a tiny boost to grunts regen
[3:18:53] <viewtifulr> 100% pat
[3:18:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat it's not even a good upgrade.
[3:18:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Don't thinkk about it lytSMUG
[3:19:00] <KeiPrime> im sure he could beat hte fucking game without it
[3:19:01] <%Pandybun> I legit don't know what Pat missed
[3:19:04] <%mikeriffic> you cannnnnnn get another one
[3:19:04] <Dunmarkh> ban them
[3:19:05] <mattmmkay> it's fine
[3:19:05] <KeiPrime> its not that hard
[3:19:05] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not like you missed a jewle for your crown and made it worth less
[3:19:06] <%42nfl19> but its a FREE UPGRADE
[3:19:06] <Grandnatics> It's only a 5 0 % health increase Pat
[3:19:08] <jorniev> YOU SHOULD HAVE
[3:19:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Like the time that people think they are saving they are losing
[3:19:08] <Grandnatics> Don't fall for it
[3:19:08] <%mikeriffic> thats what was said
[3:19:08] <%CalderGaming> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:19:10] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's just an upgrade for Grunt, just never use Grunt
[3:19:11] <peachy996> You should have scoured the corridor.
[3:19:12] <mattmmkay> in the end

[3:19:14] <%daemonazaezal> cannot buy later, its 1/2 of the krogan vit
[3:19:14] <Profmcstevie> always ask for citations on claims
[3:19:15] <mattmmkay> it doesn't eeven matter
[3:19:15] <%Ranryu692> the health stat barely matters in this game, everything is your shields/barriers
[3:19:18] <%Gamblitz> don't listen to your chat! Listen to your chat instead!

[3:19:32] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt you have to strangle those mind goblins. Kill them so that they cannot hurt you
[3:19:36] <%mikeriffic> Its only worth going back for if you are on insanity or hardcore anyhow
[3:19:39] <romc215> It says breeding pod, but no breeding happens in it

[3:23:45] <peachy996> YAY Grunt

[3:23:46] <+Grayhammatter> shepard, wrex
[3:23:46] <%42nfl19> LOL when did that gun get there
[3:23:46] <%dekkitout> Our son is gonna do great
[3:23:47] <Pookiedaexzile> SON, LETS THROW THE BALL AROUND
[3:23:51] <%SvenHolgersson> He woulda ripped you in half Shep
[3:23:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> Cutscene gun though
[3:23:53] <+Qexec> that shuriken woul dhave done nothing to grunt
[3:23:54] <+GingerStrawhat> I fucking love Grunt, like maybe more then Wrex
[3:23:54] <leinadtonu> He is a baby
[3:23:56] <+Chimeraelite> Plot weapons one shot
[3:23:57] <HaroldDonchee> yeah but cutscene
[3:23:57] <SaltyAzteca> Phasers set to kill
[3:23:58] <akitanito> maybe if you were using the shotgun
[3:23:58] <jorniev> YOU SHOOT HIM 2 TIMES
[3:23:58] <+Chimeraelite> You know this
[3:23:58] <+chronopaladin> yeah but cutscene vulnerability though
[3:23:58] <%Dakuu75> Space armor doesn't beat a SPACE GUN
[3:23:59] <$SGrim> But really good gun
[3:24:01] <James_Quivers> That's a cutscene gun tho
[3:24:01] <peachy996> Yeah sure shoot a Krogan in the Gut, that'll go well
[3:24:01] <%Reaviar> its like a guardsmen threatening a space marine
[3:24:02] <Pookiedaexzile> You have Charge
[3:24:02] <SovPho> do krogans have a backup brain
[3:24:02] <+hatok> Shepard has full space gun though
[3:24:02] <%maenos2> he respects the quad
[3:24:03] <SpaceGuntank> if you pick the renegade option, you put two rounds into grunts chest and he just has a good laugh about it and joins you anyways
[3:24:04] <%Shubreaker> renegade straight-up shoots him
[3:24:04] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt If you do shoot him in the Renegade route, he backs off
[3:24:05] <Grandnatics> You can shoot him in that cutscene
[3:24:06] <Pookiedaexzile> You have charge
[3:24:06] <slix3431> He's just that good
[3:24:06] <%bevyrage> doesn't matter if it'd do anything serious, grunt approves of the mindset
[3:24:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cutscene Bullets
[3:24:06] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat your pistol is ridiculous
[3:24:07] <%tank7013> But Pat, it's a cutscene gun
[3:24:07] <olaksi> it's a plot gun
[3:24:07] <Grandnatics> He likes it when you do it
[3:24:08] <%Aleate> That gun is insanely powerful in cutscenes
[3:24:09] <%spartanghost004> between the plate is the best place
[3:24:09] <ScreamLord> And regeneration
[3:24:10] <%luckysteak> but he has the gun version of the murder knife
[3:24:10] <%athuramn> cutscene gun is basically a rocket
[3:24:10] <Strigiform> snap my steel cybernetic head
[3:24:11] <Broken_Sonex> Nah it's a cutscene gun it's fine
[3:24:11] <peachy996> You can actually shoot him I think
[3:24:12] <M0untain_wolf> Plot armor pat
[3:24:13] <TourettesPlays> Pat its the Carmifex Hand CANNON
[3:24:14] <Grandnatics> He respects it
[3:24:14] <%StaceMcGate> cutscene gun
[3:24:15] <%king_wragles> That's why Grunt likes him
[3:24:16] <Dunmarkh> cutscene ebony and ivory
[3:24:16] <jorniev> YOU HAVE CHARGE
[3:24:16] <+D00msDayDan> a shot in the gut would have killed him if it was a cutscene
[3:24:18] <%Bt_Robot> Explosive rounds
[3:24:18] <%IamGrapes> of course he could have, he's Commander Shepard
[3:24:19] <%logoth_> Cutscene bullets are stronger
[3:24:19] <DartAran> It's a cutscene gun tho
[3:24:19] <+Tucker0603> it's the fact that he had the gall to do it, not the success of it
[3:24:19] <williamrooster> if you shoot him he shrugs it off
[3:24:20] <+Goliz> That's true. Plot bullets are super op and kill in one shot.
[3:24:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Just shoot his eye
[3:24:21] <Blank9> shepard would just charge
[3:24:21] <%Dakuu75> neat
[3:24:22] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt space armor is nothing, remember that random human at the start of ME1?
[3:24:22] <peachy996> He shrugs it off
[3:24:22] <%JoshManVGH> But Shepard could have cutscene biotics.
[3:24:22] <%Varlinator> You literrally draw a drop of blood
[3:24:23] <%maskofmichael> It's about the balls Pat. Shepards Balls!
[3:24:24] <MrPandastic> But he would shooting plot bullets though Pat. They do extra damage.
[3:24:25] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> LUL
[3:24:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> He respects the moxie Pat.
[3:24:25] <jorniev> yes
[3:24:26] <+hatok> cybernetic Shepard is canonically about as strong as a Krogan
[3:24:26] <%Deano8817> shepard

[3:24:44] <Dunmarkh> double shepard
[3:24:44] <+Grayhammatter> shepard
[3:24:44] <+chronopaladin> shepurd
[3:24:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> Shepard
[3:24:46] <Ner234> LUL
[3:24:46] <jorniev> SHEPPARD
[3:24:47] <%pokefan9956> S H E P A R D
[3:24:47] <SaltyAzteca> THEY KNEW
[3:24:48] <Josef_Stryker> SHEPAAAAAARD
[3:24:50] <%miguelrod777> SHEPARD
[3:24:50] <M0untain_wolf> UPGRADES
[3:24:51] <ScreamLord> It's genetic
[3:24:54] <olaksi> ah yes, memes
[3:24:54] <aiutare47> I always liked Grunt and noticed he sounds different, I never put two and two together and noticed thats just because hes Steve Blum as a frog boy
[3:24:56] <+wvuboii> Shepard
[3:24:57] <ExemplarKyle> They kick it up even more in a certain DLC. Kappa
[3:24:57] <Reverend_Godshyne> Hey Grunt. See ya.
[3:24:58] <+Larry_Q> HE EVENSOUNDS LIKE A FROG
[3:24:58] <+capnbeefs> Just Shepard
[3:25:01] <%pokefan9956> chaos?
[3:25:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh man I can't wait for Pat to do Citadel
[3:25:05] <Case_Ah_Dia> is Grunt just straight up the Space Marine version of the Krogan
[3:25:06] <+RaveBV> SHEPARD? Shepard... ShEpArD!
[3:25:06] <leinadtonu> U P G R A D E S
[3:25:07] <slix3431> Pick and teart
[3:25:08] <susukouhai> well now he is even more like a frog, he ribbits shepard
[3:25:10] <Grandnatics> Grunt's headplate is supposed to show off that he's a bebe compared to other Krogan
[3:25:11] <%maskofmichael> RIP AND TEAR
[3:25:11] <%the38bandit> the joke in 3 bout this is pretty good
[3:25:15] <%Pandybun> BTW Happy Birthday Grunt
[3:25:16] <James_Quivers> Grunt is a simple boy
[3:25:16] <+wvuboii> What do you think about the mission..."shepard"
[3:25:19] <%Dakuu75> DUDE, why is this weak full of so much of this shit "Shepard", "Chaos"
[3:25:21] <HaroldDonchee> he's only said like 50 words and 10 of them are shepherd
[3:25:21] <ianabstract> he's 3 years old
[3:25:22] <Pookiedaexzile> ITs not FULLY FORMED
[3:25:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> His face plate isn't fully grown because he BABY Pat
[3:25:22] <Grandnatics> He's supposed to be a baby boy
[3:25:23] <olaksi> he's a baby, pat
[3:25:23] <lloyddboy> he baby
[3:25:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah his faceplate is still growing
[3:25:25] <Goraka91> Apparently they fuse together as they get older
[3:25:27] <SpaceGuntank> Grunt is also an "adolecent" among his species
[3:25:27] <Grandnatics> His plate hasn't formed yet
[3:25:28] <Pookiedaexzile> HE BABY
[3:25:28] <+Tucker0603> he's young
[3:25:29] <+RowenCleric> he reminds me more of the leapy lizards from FF11 and 14 then a frog
[3:25:29] <sad__coyote> because Grunt is still in adolescence
[3:25:29] <falyden> KomodoHype : Shepard
[3:25:31] <%CalderGaming> he baby
[3:25:31] <MayorRev> He babey
[3:25:32] <%Jeemukun> that's cause he's a baby and it hasn't grown in yet
[3:25:32] <Broken_Sonex> Grunt it BULT DIFFRENT
[3:25:32] <%Shubreaker> he's designed like a newborn Krogan
[3:25:32] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt that is explained on Tuchanka. He's still growing.
[3:25:32] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Isn't he supposed to be an adolescent?
[3:25:33] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It because he's young
[3:25:33] <Wolfstriker121> smooth
[3:25:33] <James_Quivers> Yeah, he has the original look, more earthen, rugged, primitive
[3:25:34] <Essixian> @PatStaresAt He's basically a teenager
[3:25:35] <akitanito> smoothskin
[3:25:35] <%Varlinator> He's SUPER young. Also a perfect krogen
[3:25:35] <+CursedNobleman> hes not fully mature, his plate is soft
[3:25:35] <+Puffen0> its not fully developed because of the tank
[3:25:37] <M0untain_wolf> Not fused yet
[3:25:37] <%pokefan9956> CHAOS
[3:25:38] <logothete2401> he looks wildly different
[3:25:39] <%dekkitout> He's an optimized krogan in his prime
[3:25:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> His Face Plate isn't fully formed because he is BABY
[3:25:39] <williamrooster> cause hes a baby
[3:25:39] <peachy996> Grunt is underrated. He's no Wrex but he's not trying to be
[3:25:40] <sad__coyote> he gotta grow more
[3:25:40] <leinadtonu> HE BABY
[3:25:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> GRUNT IS BABY
[3:25:45] <Grandnatics> HE'S A BABY
[3:25:46] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean it has to be tough to design Krogan, so many look so similar that it's tough to not just make Wrex 2
[3:25:46] <+chronopaladin> he bb
[3:25:46] <Dunmarkh> da baby
[3:25:46] <Pookiedaexzile> HE BABY!
[3:25:46] <$SGrim> He baby
[3:25:47] <%shadowsofpain> They're all like that when young, his plate will fuse together in time
[3:25:47] <akitanito> he's literally a baby
[3:25:49] <%Ranryu692> He goes through puberty during the game LUL
[3:25:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Krogan plates look more like amphibian skin where as Grunt's look like straight up rock
[3:25:50] <Grandnatics> HE IS CHILD
[3:25:51] <%MisterRockett> The perfect Krogan looks DRAMATICALLY different from most Krogan.
[3:25:51] <slix3431> Angry baby
[3:25:52] <KeiPrime> he's just a boi
[3:25:52] <+Tucker0603> CHILD SOLDIER KROGAN!!!!
[3:25:53] <Wolfstriker121> hes legit CHAOS!!
[3:25:54] <+Puffen0> he baby
[3:25:55] <%shurtal> he's like, 14 days old?
[3:25:55] <+senfood> HE'S BABY
[3:25:56] <%Dfreddy8> He's just our Baby Boy
[3:25:57] <%IamGrapes> yeah Grunts like a teenager
[3:25:57] <sad__coyote> you have a Teenage Krogan. just wait for prom night. woof
[3:25:57] <slix3431> He should be called baby
[3:25:57] <ScreamLord> Like a baby skull
[3:25:58] <mighty_fine_trousers> Wait so is Grunt basically Damian Wayne?
[3:25:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Grunt is literally Zangief, Pat
[3:25:59] <HaroldDonchee> dude imagine if krogans imprinted on the first thing they saw
[3:26:01] <+MidnightBurst12> Big baby
[3:26:03] <%CalderGaming> Streamer Doesn't Know
[3:26:06] <%NopeBadguy> DAMN BITCH YOU LIVE LIKE THIS
[3:26:06] <M0untain_wolf> Grunt is like a child soldier
[3:26:07] <Goraka91> 18 year old Krogan I guess
[3:26:09] <+Ghufufin> babby genius
[3:26:09] <%Ranryu692> @mighty_fine_trousers yes
[3:26:09] <thisisanavailableusername> i didn't notice, i was too busy looking at his plate goatee
[3:26:10] <Pookiedaexzile> He's the best
[3:26:12] <+Puffen0> he good baby
[3:26:12] <+sermittens> get da shotgun
[3:26:12] <peachy996> I'd love it if Grunt survived to see Mass Effect 4
[3:26:15] <+chronopaladin> child soldier? ol' 'war crime' shepard
[3:26:16] <Afterman_> grunt is just TTYD violence
[3:26:20] <BlackStarAura> KROGAN SHOTGUN
[3:26:21] <%pokefan9956> SHEPARD
[3:26:21] <SaltyAzteca> Shepat
[3:26:21] <Ner234> S H E P A R D
[3:26:23] <%Dfreddy8> you TALK TOO MUCH
[3:26:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Grunt is Zangief, Pat.
[3:26:28] <sougoe> Tank
[3:26:31] <+Grayhammatter> shepard.
[3:26:32] <Dunmarkh> based child soldier
[3:26:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect 4: Grunts First Day out
[3:26:35] <peachy996> Grunt is going to be great for Horizon
[3:26:35] <%Varlinator> I mean you know they had to do it
[3:26:36] <Goraka91> SabaPing
[3:26:37] <Afterman_> someone draw pat's grunt as Woolie's violence
[3:26:40] <%IamGrapes> Wrex
[3:26:41] <mattmmkay> you have to feed your fish?
[3:26:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Comparing Grunt and Wrex is like trying to compare Chris Pratt to Arnold Schwarzenegger
[3:26:42] <%StaceMcGate> fish, and give ingredients to cook @PatStaresAt
[3:26:43] <M0untain_wolf> not getting the auto feeder
[3:26:44] <%spartanghost004> also your hmaster
[3:26:46] <Wofoeh> I got a simple question for chat
[3:26:46] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Would recommend doing Kasumi and Zaeed's loyalty missions before you kick off the last Dossier so you don't trigger the Collector Ship countdown
[3:26:46] <thetunnelhomer> Oh man, Grunt *is* Zangief
[3:26:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> on the topic of uniquely designed krogan, Drack was one of the actually good things about Andromeda
[3:26:47] <+Puffen0> grunt is baby just like geif
[3:26:50] <akitanito> why don't you have automatic dispensers in space
[3:26:52] <%PatNTheHat> Oh man, Shepard really is using child soldiers here isn't he
[3:26:53] <%Varlinator> KELLY, FEED FISH!
[3:26:56] <Wofoeh> Tomorrow I’m pondering on what to play
[3:26:56] <olaksi> it's not the True ending unless the fish survive too
[3:26:56] <SpaceGuntank> or you could just bug your secretary to feed them for you ya know.
[3:26:56] <Broken_Sonex> Grunt is a literal Child Solder.
[3:26:58] <mattmmkay> don't forgeet to feed your space lizard
[3:26:58] <medoodoo> have you gotten the biotic skinhead lady?
[3:27:00] <%DianaTheAscian> No full helmet
[3:27:02] <%ape_hawk> that visor makes u look like a chode, good job
[3:27:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh shit, I thought he sounded familiar
[3:27:03] <%shadowsofpain> change your arms too
[3:27:04] <%Pandybun> Pink Tint
[3:27:04] <peachy996> Drack is also another great Krogan
[3:27:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Gold
[3:27:05] <DublinRage> like petting the Poogie after a hunt in MonHunt?
[3:27:06] <jorniev> PAT... zangief
[3:27:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why can't you just order someone to feed your fucking fish.
[3:27:10] <LluthyY> pink, you know you want to
[3:27:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Go Gold, get shiney
[3:27:12] <televisedrevolting> Grunt was born to kill.
[3:27:13] <BlackStarAura> I just hold off on buying fish until I get Kelly to feed them for me
[3:27:14] <romc215> Hot neon pink would look awesome
[3:27:15] <peachy996> He's not trying to be Wrex either
[3:27:16] <%DorianCreed> That super dark red looks pretty sick
[3:27:17] <+Puffen0> go pink or go home
[3:27:18] <thetunnelhomer> Drak was the only good part of Andromeda. And he's just a worse Wrex
[3:27:22] <%NopeBadguy> Would recommend doing Kasumi and Zaeed's loyalty missions before you kick off the Jack Dossier so you don't trigger the Collector Ship countdown after Horizon
[3:27:22] <%Dfreddy8> It's Pride month from Pink
[3:27:23] <medoodoo> have you recruited the skinhead lady?
[3:27:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @aWanderingKaivo It's a reversal on Grunt and Shepard's relationship. Krogan adopts you
[3:27:23] <Grandnatics> GO WATERMELON
[3:27:24] <Zalapski> that's a lotta nipples
[3:27:26] <%maskofmichael> At least have red buttons
[3:27:26] <%Parapattern> Brown poop stripe
[3:27:26] <%Gamblitz> All green
[3:27:27] <%king_wragles> I'm a sucker for black and red designs
[3:27:28] <TourettesPlays> @Broken_Sonex If he's a child soldier than so is every clone in the prequels
[3:27:28] <Essixian> Legs: "Stimulator Conduits"... Pat, did you put on the pants that jerk you off
[3:27:33] <%Pandybun> WAIT THE FISH
[3:27:33] <peachy996> Drack is like your tired busted krogan grampa
[3:27:34] <Wofoeh> Do I play Bayonetta, DMC, or Batman Arkham asylum?
[3:27:34] <+capnbeefs> I can’t wait for the citadel dlc
[3:27:37] <%Dakuu75> "You go this way, i'll go home"\
[3:27:37] <%captainpodock> Use Zangief colors
[3:27:40] <M0untain_wolf> ha got'em
[3:27:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am flabergasted that Shepard doesn't just get one of the crew to feed his fish.
[3:27:43] <%ape_hawk> did pat feed his fish?
[3:27:44] <Pookiedaexzile> The Skin head lady is already on the ship, You get Miranda right away
[3:27:46] <%shadowsofpain> not going to change the arms?
[3:27:48] <Goraka91> LL
[3:27:48] <%StaceMcGate> did he feed the fish?

[3:28:02] <ingman112> @nopebadguy Why does that matter? After the ship it’s unlimited time before the IFF
[3:28:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> did pat buy the thing that automatically feeds the fish
[3:28:07] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Exactly! @TourettesPlays

[3:30:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Joker get a bigger neck in the remaster?
[3:30:35] <MayorRev> SETH GREENE
[3:30:48] <+Puffen0> I love joker so much
[3:30:49] <%ape_hawk> "tenure at FU" is a p good line
[3:30:51] <ingman112> @nopebadguy Again, unlimited time between collector ship and IFF. He can just wait to do tali’s loyalty mission til after the IFF
[3:30:52] <peachy996> Yeah Garrus stick in butt
[3:30:53] <%NopeBadguy> CRYO IS BUSTED
[3:30:54] <+EmptyMug> Cockpit questions has new lines every once in a while
[3:30:56] <+senfood> Tenure at FU LUL
[3:30:57] <%pokefan9956> so why did joker join the human supremacists
[3:30:58] <M0untain_wolf> more flames
[3:30:59] <Dabrikishaw> Mordin doesn't act like that though
[3:31:06] <+Puffen0> wtf was that sound
[3:31:07] <+Grayhammatter> incenjerry?
[3:31:08] <%Pandybun> 0-o
[3:31:10] <+critikal_bit> HIC
[3:31:12] <%Nobrev> vineHard HIC
[3:31:13] <ingman112> Joker does get new dialogue after every mission too
[3:31:13] <KeiPrime> they let him fly  thats why
[3:31:15] <%StaceMcGate> that is a lie
[3:31:15] <%athuramn> wtf
[3:31:17] <$SGrim> @pokefan9956 alliance took his pilot's license
[3:31:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @pokefan9956 I think they asked him to
[3:31:18] <KeiPrime> the alliance grounded him
[3:31:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Time to go talk to the Genocide denier
[3:31:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ComfortableStranger She's already bought and sold on that Turian.
[3:31:23] <Goraka91> Time for Jello
[3:31:23] <+Tucker0603> IFF gives a hard limit
[3:31:24] <+chester804> do all loyalty missions, then reaper IFF lol
[3:31:24] <%StaceMcGate> you have like 2-3 missions after IFF
[3:31:26] <Dunmarkh> @pokefan9956 because they gave him a cool spaceship to fly
[3:31:26] <SovPho> me2 is very time sensitive
[3:31:27] <williamrooster> you got 2 missions
[3:31:27] <M0untain_wolf> Pat there is unlimited time
[3:31:30] <%spartanghost004> between the ship and iff yeah
[3:31:30] <Zalapski> timer only hits after you get IFF
[3:31:31] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The countdown to the suicide mission doesn't start until you do Reaper IFF.
[3:31:35] <SpaceGuntank> you can only do ONE mission after starting the IFF, and you're supposed to use it to do Legion's loyalty mission
[3:31:35] <%charp35> After the iif is the time limit
[3:31:36] <%bread_assassin> No, there is. Plot kicks in AFTER IFF
[3:31:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> waiting to do Tali's loyalty mission locks out the romance?
[3:31:38] <Dabrikishaw> You can do 2 missions after getting the Reaper IFF.
[3:31:39] <+Puffen0> yeah the time limit is 1 mission
[3:31:39] <TourettesPlays> When the mission "Acquire reaper IFF" appears, do that absolutely last
[3:31:42] <+trackles_64> Do the IFF LAST
[3:31:43] <mattmmkay> romance the vagina alien
[3:31:45] <%ComfortableStranger> LE also expanded the number of missions you can do after IFF mission before crew gets kidnapped
[3:31:49] <%justnathan18> How far in is we
[3:31:50] <+Tucker0603> timer is only after IFF
[3:31:50] <Grandnatics> You get *ONE* mission after IFF
[3:31:52] <+GingerStrawhat> If you want everyone to live you have to get Legion last I believe
[3:31:53] <SpaceGuntank> if you do more than 1 mission you start loosing more of the Normany crew
[3:31:53] <peachy996> 1. Tali Mission 2. Legion Mission
[3:31:53] <M0untain_wolf> Do IFF last
[3:31:56] <ExemplarKyle> So basically, do absolutely everything before the IFF
[3:32:02] <peachy996> I remember doing this. You'll be fine
[3:32:02] <ScreamLord> Unlimited time between Collector Ship and Derelict Reaper
[3:32:02] <olaksi> I just save edit that timer, fuck leaving legion out of everything
[3:32:15] <James_Quivers> Do Tali, done
[3:32:19] <ingman112> There’s a timer AFTER the IFF. But between the collector ship and IFF, no time limit
[3:32:21] <%valriot> You cant romance her that way
[3:32:26] <Dabrikishaw> You got it Pat
[3:32:27] <%ComfortableStranger> thats the way i do it
[3:32:29] <%bread_assassin> If you do Tali's Loyalty mission after IFF, is there enough time to do her romance arc?
[3:32:31] <Josef_Stryker> I wish Legion was around longer. Maybe have him show up in the Collector Ship instead of the Derelict Reaper
[3:32:32] <%Gamblitz> Mordin is just the Medic from TF2
[3:32:33] <%Faustgesicht> HERE WE GO
[3:32:35] <ingman112> Yep boom
[3:32:37] <%HitchhikingThrough> I fucking love mordin
[3:32:37] <$lotharrio> Yeah! STG!
[3:32:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt If that's your roadmap, I would recommend doing Lair of the Shadow Broker pre-Reaper IFF
[3:32:41] <thetunnelhomer> Oh yea, you can't romance Tali like that.
[3:32:45] <+razielhex> Scientist Salarian time
[3:32:45] <Zalapski> also other kinds LUL
[3:32:47] <+razielhex> ??
[3:32:49] <scrumbotime> Mordin Did Some Waarrr Crrrriiimes
[3:32:51] <Virokwet> Mordin believes in just talk
[3:32:54] <+Puffen0> GENOCIDE OH YEAH
[3:33:01] <aiutare47> Oh yeah do all the DLC before IFF
[3:33:02] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt if you have 0 the IFF will be installed as soon as you approach the galaxy map, but that can be bypassed by picking up legions, but upon completion it'll install the IFF
[3:33:04] <Goraka91> @Josef_Stryker There's cut dialogue that implies you could recruit anyone at any time, he could've been on that blue suns prison place
[3:33:04] <+Tucker0603> I did Tali's right away, I want that booty
[3:33:05] <$lotharrio> Double down on war crimes, Mordin! DO IT!
[3:33:05] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> oof
[3:33:05] <+Grayhammatter> mordin did some war crimes monkaS
[3:33:06] <%ape_hawk> DOCTOR WAR CRIMESSSSSSS
[3:33:07] <%StaceMcGate> YOU JUST DID
[3:33:09] <%Gamblitz> Fucking ASSS
[3:33:10] <%EsotericOdyssey> wow mordin that's racist
[3:33:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> krogan scientist? HUH HUH
[3:33:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> I like him saying this after meeting Okeer
[3:33:13] <peachy996> You just met Okeer
[3:33:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Its okay For wrex to say that
[3:33:14] <+chronopaladin> grunt's father was a brilliant scientist!
[3:33:16] <%Garthunox> @aiutare47 except Arrival
[3:33:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Not You
[3:33:17] <%NopeBadguy> @aiutare47 Not all. Save Arrival for post-game
[3:33:24] <%PatNTheHat> @PatStaresAt Mordin upgraded the genophage to the latest version of Windows 10
[3:33:29] <aiutare47> yeah that makes sense
[3:33:29] <+senfood> Krogan scientist exist. They just specialize in fields that involve blowing shit up.
[3:33:32] <%JohnAtDawn> DAMN MORDIN
[3:33:36] <SaltyAzteca> @StaceMcGate no we didnt Kappa
[3:33:37] <%bread_assassin> Why do DLC before IFF? What's wrong with doing it post-game?
[3:33:37] <+Tucker0603> mordin: doctor war crimes
[3:33:37] <TourettesPlays> You actually meet a Krogan Scientist on Tunchanka in this game
[3:33:40] <aiutare47> I did it all in one go and it felt weird and janky after
[3:33:41] <SpaceGuntank> the best part of Mordin is that if you REALLY bug him about the Genophage you can make him lose his cool and have him shout at you in 3
[3:33:44] <+Puffen0> at least his beliefs evolve in 3
[3:33:45] <peachy996> If you have Wrex killed you meet another Krogan scientist on Tuchanka
[3:33:48] <%ComfortableStranger> "as a tore my blade form his chest I knew he was telling the truth" "not my preferred form of peer review"
[3:33:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh but I thought ya'll loved Mordin
[3:33:56] <Afterman_> sociologists
[3:33:56] <+trackles_64> But batarian slavery is culture
[3:33:59] <Afterman_> thinking thats ok
[3:34:00] <Pookiedaexzile> His little song
[3:34:02] <%ape_hawk> yeah, i mean, the krogans WERE throwing rocks at planets, soooooo
[3:34:04] <%EsotericOdyssey> "restabilized"
[3:34:04] <Goraka91> DOUBLE GENOCIDE YEAH
[3:34:06] <MayorRev> Space Racism
[3:34:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SpaceGuntank It's a really good scene tho
[3:34:09] <TourettesPlays> @bread_assassin Well for me it was becuase I forgot ME2 even has a postgame
[3:34:09] <%StaceMcGate> Genophage 2.0
[3:34:11] <$lotharrio> War crime combo!
[3:34:11] <Pookiedaexzile> "Stabalize"
[3:34:12] <TheIronBrass> God that's fucked
[3:34:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> THATS FUCKED UP YO
[3:34:14] <M0untain_wolf> Mordin made the Geno
[3:34:17] <peachy996> The characters in 2 have arcs. Well except Jacob
[3:34:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> @TourettesPlays yeah, I forget if Mordin has unique dialogue in his shop there, I imagine he does
[3:34:20] <%DianaTheAscian> GENOCIDE 2
[3:34:21] <%NopeBadguy> HE LACED WATER SUPPLIES AND HOSPITALS
[3:34:23] <%spartanghost004> oh joy genocide
[3:34:24] <%Garthunox> @Pookiedaexzile Mordins great what're you talking about?
[3:34:24] <Broken_Sonex> *I N H A L E*
[3:34:27] <ExemplarKyle> You know what's better than genocide? GENOCIDE 2.0
[3:34:31] <+chronopaladin> GARBAGE
[3:34:31] <Blank9> the krogans were destroying multiple planets and live hundreds of years while making hundreds of kids
[3:34:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> > Distributed in hospitals fuck that
[3:34:36] <%ExpressNode> Space Eugenics
[3:34:38] <LluthyY> Big War Crimes
[3:34:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Evil  I can see wy people think all aliens are evil
[3:34:42] <Kit_VS> He wants a Krogan final solution WutFace
[3:34:44] <%Faustgesicht> Genophage 1.5
[3:34:45] <%ComfortableStranger> @Broken_Sonex though the nose
[3:34:45] <jorniev> if krogan went all Klingon on the rest of the galaxy they would still lose
[3:34:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Mordin is on that good Copium
[3:34:53] <Pookiedaexzile> @Garthunox Mordin is well written and good, he's also evil and shittty
[3:34:57] <+Tucker0603> BULLSHIT
[3:35:00] <Blank9> the turians would be 100% justified with just glassing the krogan planet
[3:35:00] <ingman112> Fucking tuskegee krogan shit
[3:35:02] <Pookiedaexzile> I love him too
[3:35:05] <peachy996> Yep
[3:35:09] <%spartanghost004> yep
[3:35:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Copium is a helluva drug.
[3:35:09] <Dabrikishaw> Honestly, actual genocide would have been better than the Genophage
[3:35:10] <%NopeBadguy> Mordin is only like EXTREME COPIUM
[3:35:10] <ExemplarKyle> Yeah, fuck dem stillborn krogan kids
[3:35:11] <%EsotericOdyssey> he sounds like he's trying to convince himself just as much as shepard
[3:35:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Lawful Evil
[3:35:12] <%DianaTheAscian> WHAT A BUNCH OF BS
[3:35:12] <+Tucker0603> YES YOU ARE
[3:35:14] <%ape_hawk> YOU ARE A WAR CRIMINAL
[3:35:14] <+Puffen0> I am the very model of a scientist salaren, ive studied species turin asari and batarian
[3:35:14] <%ComfortableStranger> Mordin in ME3 "I MADE A MISTAKE!"
[3:35:15] <%NopeBadguy> *on
[3:35:15] <%dd44dostivei> that's easy to say when you're not a krogan
[3:35:15] <Afterman_> mmm
[3:35:16] <Josef_Stryker> Mordin runs on logic not on emotion
[3:35:17] <Dunmarkh> fuck you
[3:35:18] <+senfood> @ingman112 Holy shit, you're right.
[3:35:18] <%Gamblitz> GUILTY!!
[3:35:22] <%DianaTheAscian> BRUH
[3:35:22] <%NopeBadguy> MORDIN IS ON OMEGA COPIUM
[3:35:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Mordin is quick to call out everyone else's ethics but never talks about his own until 3
[3:35:23] <+Grayhammatter> mmmmmm
[3:35:24] <$lotharrio> The BIGGEST war criminals!
[3:35:24] <blue8moon> mordin you killed so many babies
[3:35:24] <%spartanghost004> riiight
[3:35:25] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[3:35:25] <%HitchhikingThrough> Super mega war criminal
[3:35:25] <+SaphronBlackbourne> SaphronBlackbourne subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Got to sub again! Metroid stuff was announced on my birthday and I'm very happy.
[3:35:25] <%logoth_> Mordin is my favorite war criminal
[3:35:26] <Wolfstriker121> LEGIT LAWFUL EVIL
[3:35:29] <scrumbotime> "I didn't kill all their babies! I just killed SOME of their babies!"
[3:35:29] <%dekkitout> Mordy: "No u"
[3:35:29] <%Garthunox> @Pookiedaexzile He's not doing it out of malice
[3:35:29] <Zalapski> mordin > pat
[3:35:29] <Mr_Rakjo> COPIUM Mordin
[3:35:31] <Goraka91> COPIUM
[3:35:31] <+Grayhammatter> BRUH
[3:35:32] <TheIronBrass> LITERAL WAR CRIMES
[3:35:32] <%Varlinator> Really Mordin?
[3:35:32] <iosephe> he only kills 999 in 1000
[3:35:33] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Mordin “yeah the CIA is pretty poggers” Solus
[3:35:34] <Ids560> he's real good at convincing himself of this
[3:35:34] <HaroldDonchee> war criminal, but not BIG war criminal
[3:35:34] <%EsotericOdyssey> he sounds uncertain
[3:35:35] <%FunkyStreams> its fiiine
[3:35:36] <ianabstract> Because Geno doesn't always have to end with Cide
[3:35:38] <jorniev> IT WAS WRONG
[3:35:38] <MayorRev> B r u h
[3:35:39] <%walternatorz> but it wasn't part of a "war"
[3:35:39] <+Puffen0> is it a war crime if there is no war? Kappa
[3:35:40] <Josef_Stryker> BUT THE KROGAN REBELLION THO
[3:35:41] <peachy996> And he gets more agitated
[3:35:42] <%Monkeyweed21> genocide is fine as long as its slow
[3:35:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh hey he says it
[3:35:43] <Pookiedaexzile> @Garthunox YES HE IS
[3:35:43] <+NeonLight> *bordering*
[3:35:43] <no123450n> "bordering"
[3:35:44] <%NopeBadguy> MORDIN BIG COPIUM
[3:35:44] <$lotharrio> Biological warfare is absolutely a war crime!
[3:35:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Most kissable War Criminal.
[3:35:45] <+Tucker0603> MORDIN: DOCTOR WAR CRIMES!!!!!
[3:35:49] <Smokin_Fish> that looks like a nice hoodie
[3:35:50] <Dunmarkh> "\""bordering"""
[3:35:51] <%ExpressNode> "Bordering" it is a war ccrime
[3:35:51] <$Captainahab_37> i like the casual n7 gildan hoodie
[3:35:52] <%ape_hawk> NOT BORDERING ON A WAR CRIME, IT *WAS* A WAR CRIME
[3:35:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Lol
[3:35:53] <%snow_bush> But there wasn't a war going on so no war crime. Just normal crime
[3:35:54] <+Grayhammatter> it was a war crime
[3:35:54] <%Garthunox> @Pookiedaexzile Nope
[3:35:55] <TourettesPlays> @Pookiedaexzile LITERALLY the path to hell is paved with good intentions
[3:35:55] <arduousScavenger> "Sorry Not Sorry for War Crimes."
[3:35:55] <%JoshManVGH> "Boardering" he says
[3:35:56] <%athuramn> Canadian government did that too btw
[3:35:56] <aiutare47> oh also what forced the Genophage was krogan use of "Kinetic Drops" which were dropping extinction sized asteroids on Garden worlds. Krogan wouldve committed a thousand genocides in a heartbeat, they wouldve if not stopped. @PatStaresAt
[3:35:57] <%JohnAtDawn> MAN THEY WALKED THIS BACK
[3:35:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mordin: The Most Kissable War Criminal
[3:35:59] <adustconstant> This game is brought to you by western canada.
[3:36:01] <jorniev> he is such an amazing character
[3:36:02] <Kit_VS> Mordin For Space Prison
[3:36:02] <%dekkitout> "I'll fucking do it again"
[3:36:03] <slix3431> Put more garbage in Krogan
[3:36:03] <%MugenSandan> Mordin could have also had residential schools on his resume and would be the exact same character
[3:36:03] <scrumbotime> Just let Wrex in this room and give him 5 minutes
[3:36:04] <peachy996> Man I love Mordin
[3:36:04] <%Varlinator> Bad Mordin. BAD!
[3:36:06] <falyden> KomodoHype war crimes!!!
[3:36:06] <+BlackIronVengarl> Leave mordin alone you cowards
[3:36:07] <+senfood> Mordin "Tuskeegeee Was a Trial Run" Solus
[3:36:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> He's like "don't like it? I can go back to my clinic, fuck you."
[3:36:09] <masterofzin> pat shep looks like a ghoul from fallout
[3:36:10] <Afterman_> mordin said "is it a war crime if there is no war? nope!"
[3:36:10] <Pookiedaexzile> He literally is doing it out of Malice
[3:36:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like to imagine Cerberus supplied the N7 hoodie to make shep feel at home
[3:36:22] <M0untain_wolf> Mordin is such a great character
[3:36:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogan are warlike and need to be controlled
[3:36:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> So when does he change his mind and decide to kill himself
[3:36:25] <%NopeBadguy> but yeah, if that's your roadmap, i'd recommend doing lair of the shadow broker pre-reaper iff. just be aware starting it will skip liara's base game quests if not done.
[3:36:25] <Pookiedaexzile> that is malice
[3:36:27] <Blank9> the krogan did a million more war crimes and wouldn't have stopped
[3:36:28] <TourettesPlays> Wait Pat you forgot to ask Mordin to sing Gilbert and Sullivan!!
[3:36:29] <$lotharrio> Biological warfare is one of the base definitions of warcrime.
[3:36:32] <Dunmarkh> Execute Mordin
[3:36:33] <+chronopaladin> krogans are just saiyans huh
[3:36:34] <%athuramn> canada has sterilized people in the 10s of thousands because of eugenics
[3:36:36] <jorniev> TRUTH
[3:36:37] <ExemplarKyle> Someone needs to pile the stillborn Krogan children at Mordin's feet and ask him if it was worth it.
[3:36:38] <scrumbotime> They were doing their wars BECAUSE they were Speed Uplifted FOR WAR!
[3:36:40] <SpaceGuntank> they destroyed Tuchanka with a NUCLEAR WINTER
[3:36:40] <%IamGrapes> Mordin is like the WW2 vet that says "we didnt go hard enough"
[3:36:40] <Pookiedaexzile> THEN FIGHT THEM
[3:36:41] <medoodoo> ends jsutify the means?
[3:36:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> exactly fuck him
[3:36:46] <%ComfortableStranger> the krogan nuked eachother before the genophage
[3:36:46] <M0untain_wolf> Evil by HUMAN STANDERDS
[3:36:47] <ingman112> @pookiedaexzile I will disagree with that and say he did what he thought was right
[3:36:47] <aiutare47> Dont pretend it wasnt shit. it was, but it was a necessary evil.
[3:36:49] <%NopeBadguy> why is who still here?
[3:36:52] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt they stay until upgraded
[3:36:52] <+Puffen0> but pat, the statistics Kappa
[3:36:55] <Ids560> these conversations are kinda why I disagree with doc on garrus being the morally worst companion
[3:36:55] <%dekkitout> But Pat, evil isn't real. So no evil was done HahaThink
[3:36:58] <Blank9> but he just reduced their birth rates to what most other aliens have
[3:37:00] <%Garthunox> @Pookiedaexzile BUT THEY NEEDED TO BE CULLED! It's an awful thing he did but he's not an evil person!
[3:37:02] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Krogans are just Mandos
[3:37:02] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt I'm looking at your character and I was wondering if you still have the scar on your cheek
[3:37:02] <+trackles_64> f u jacob
[3:37:05] <Goraka91> Jacob you're worse than Ashley
[3:37:06] <%Gamblitz> Jacob likes staying boring
[3:37:07] <%justnathan18> Where we at?
[3:37:13] <peachy996> The Genophage is still one lucky baby among the pile of stillbirths
[3:37:15] <James_Quivers> During the time of the Krogan Rebelliions, it was much more justifiable. Thousands of years later with a much weaker people, it is less justifiable to renew the genophage.
[3:37:15] <Flame_Water> the krogan would destroy the universe if they had the numbers
[3:37:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> That is incorrect.
[3:37:17] <%maskofmichael> @dekkitout He's morally grey
[3:37:18] <Pookiedaexzile> But they needed to be culled
[3:37:18] <Goraka91> Stillbirths yo
[3:37:19] <HaroldDonchee> @dekkitout evil is just brain chemicals
[3:37:22] <peachy996> it's STILL TIURBO fucked
[3:37:22] <Pookiedaexzile> I gotta get outta this chat
[3:37:23] <akitanito> they still get born but die
[3:37:24] <%spartanghost004> 1 in 1000
[3:37:24] <Blank9> it doesn't mean they're sterile, pat
[3:37:26] <%ape_hawk> its the stillbirths
[3:37:28] <jorniev> STILLBIRTHS
[3:37:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Wow
[3:37:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> its the millions of dead babies
[3:37:34] <TourettesPlays> @Ids560 Samara is more morally corrupt than Garrus is lol
[3:37:35] <%aWanderingKaivo> literally
[3:37:35] <%miguelrod777> stillbirths
[3:37:36] <aiutare47> its the moral destruction.
[3:37:37] <Dabrikishaw> Massive stillbirths
[3:37:38] <+EmptyMug> Mortality
[3:37:39] <+keyoray> stillbirths everywhere
[3:37:39] <James_Quivers> Piles of dead babies
[3:37:39] <%Varlinator> He reduced it to like 0.01% chance of live births!
[3:37:41] <+Puffen0> its like a ratio
[3:37:43] <Josef_Stryker> They could've just made it so that they made less eggs
[3:37:44] <M0untain_wolf> not simple as it is
[3:37:46] <$lotharrio> It's having 999 stillbirths.
[3:37:48] <ExemplarKyle> They birth at the same rate - 999 out of 1000 births results in a stillborn. So, it's not only genocide, IT'S BABY GENOCIDE
[3:37:48] <scrumbotime> Its not Fertility, it's Miscarriages
[3:37:50] <+senfood> And the increase in stillbirths. That's existentially nightmarish for a race.
[3:37:50] <Dunmarkh> 1000 dead baby corpses
[3:37:52] <Blank9> if it was thousands of living babies in a single clutch it'd be unsustainable
[3:37:52] <%Garthunox> @Pookiedaexzile It's a fuckin game calm down
[3:37:54] <+Grayhammatter> stillbirths everywhere
[3:37:54] <ianabstract> One Hundred Million Forced Abortions
[3:37:56] <%ape_hawk> imagine giving birth to thousands of dead babies that never had a chance
[3:37:57] <%Gamblitz> High Infancy deathrate
[3:37:57] <peachy996> You talk to Eve about it in ME3 and she contemplates suicide
[3:37:57] <jorniev> INCREDIBLE INCREASE ON STILLBIRTHS
[3:37:58] <ingman112> It’s a combination I believe
[3:37:59] <Josef_Stryker> But instead they made it so the Krogan had stillbirths which is horrific
[3:38:01] <SwarfegaHead> wow pats being right about something
[3:38:02] <SupportWriter> It made a ton of still births
[3:38:04] <arduousScavenger> "Moridin was the coolest guy!" -Naruto
[3:38:06] <%justnathan18> Show me the squad so I know whose on the team lmfao
[3:38:06] <plaguedoctor_syan> i learn the other day there a Grunt and Mordin conflict just like there a Miranda and Jack one and Tali and Legion but it got discarded
[3:38:07] <Afterman_> a million dead bebbs
[3:38:07] <M0untain_wolf> 1-2 babies out of DOZENS
[3:38:10] <peachy996> Like you also have to remember the female perspective on this
[3:38:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> They’ve got a lot of dead babies to name Turok
[3:38:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also remember that the Krogan, to my knowledge, were given technology by the Turians/Salarians and used as shock troops, so the only reason they're a threat in the first place is because they were given technology they didn't have and dropped in the middle of wars.
[3:38:13] <ScreamLord> 1 in 1000 children survive
[3:38:14] <$Captainahab_37> birds must be eatin good tho
[3:38:18] <Broken_Sonex> @arduousScavenger YEAHHHH
[3:38:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat What's the difference between a horse and a person? Horse stable
[3:38:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine if roaches were nine feet tall and could crush your skull with a pinky
[3:38:23] <Pookiedaexzile> @Garthunox Now I'm taking it too seriously because I disagree with you....I know this playbook
[3:38:24] <+Puffen0> its like, if they have 1000 eggs than only 1 outta the 1000 is alive
[3:38:27] <%WackyGear> @arduousScavenger He's basically orochimaru
[3:38:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @M0untain_wolf 1 out of 1000
[3:38:30] <+DrBunni> it's that they're taking away the reproductive rights of the krogan out right. It's an act of genocide either way.
[3:38:32] <blue8moon> which just drives down populations because of the mental trauma of birthing dead babies
[3:38:33] <%Varlinator> On the plus side, lotta eggs to make omelettes out of
[3:38:33] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> yeah that must fuck the psyche of a society REAL hard
[3:38:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Is the argument for the genophage I guess
[3:38:36] <+Tucker0603> thosands of dead babies really kills the mood
[3:38:37] <TourettesPlays> WAit how does a Krogan push out 1000 kids at once
[3:38:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> The Krogan should've been left alone
[3:38:37] <%StaceMcGate> this guy sounds so familiar
[3:38:37] <ingman112> @arduousscavenger In this it’s “Mordin was the coolest!” -Grunt
[3:38:39] <slix3431> GUMBO

[3:38:59] <%pokefan9956> RACISM
[3:38:59] <TheIronBrass> Oh my god
[3:38:59] <%ComfortableStranger> Wrex made the point that the genophage was devastating but it wasn't what was killing the krogan. selfsihness and short sightedness of krogan mercs was
[3:39:00] <scrumbotime> Ah good, Shepard keeps hiring racists.
[3:39:01] <%demiiluna> that's kind of a messed up thing to say bro
[3:39:02] <aiutare47> And Krogan of course dont understand the science so they assume it makes the WOMAN sterile, meaning the krogan women often kill themselves out of shame after their first still birth
[3:39:03] <M0untain_wolf> CALIBRATIONS
[3:39:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> tentacle heads is a slur dude

[3:40:52] <ingman112> @patstaresat The only danger with the mission timing you’re doing is it might fuck up the Tali romance? Like delay it to the point you can’t complete it. Just something to be cautious of

[3:43:03] <viewtifulr> YEEEEEAH BIG cheats
[3:43:03] <$lotharrio> Yeah but what if Pat NEEDS Grunt to stay alive in a mission?
[3:43:05] <$Ziegsy> he emptying the baby?
[3:43:05] <+Puffen0> only effects grunt btw @patstaresat
[3:43:07] <$Captainahab_37> im reinstalling Jade Empire rn in fact lmfao
[3:43:08] <%DianaTheAscian> @LeotheHuntsman It has never been just a bit
[3:43:08] <mattmmkay> pat
[3:43:14] <%ComfortableStranger> ***
[3:43:14] <MayorRev> no hes cheatin
[3:43:15] <%pokefan9956> inb4 this corrupts his saves and ends the playthrough lol
[3:43:16] <mattmmkay> can you play sayonara: wild hearts
[3:43:18] <%HitchhikingThrough> Finally caught a PatStaresAt stream. He stopped the stream midway through to cheat engine in an item he missed. Great entertainer he is
[3:43:20] <%StaceMcGate> 25% health boost but cmon. He'll use Grunt for two missions
[3:43:21] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s goblin time baybeeeeee psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:43:21] <HaroldDonchee> THE GOBLIN SHARKS ARE SWIMMING IN MY BRAIN
[3:43:23] <mattmmkay> I wanna know what your reaction's gonna be
[3:43:23] <plaguedoctor_syan> You guys are talking about like you don´t know Pat
[3:43:32] <%shadowsofpain> Guys let him do his thing, old intro said it best "GOTTA CHEAT"
[3:43:36] <%justnathan18> @pokefan9956 prolly why he made a xopy
[3:43:40] <mattmmkay> It's got zelda stuff in it
[3:43:40] <%X2Eliah> I thought krogan vitality upgrade just gives shep +10% ealth
[3:43:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Jade empire is great on Replace as of 10 years ago when I did a Repllay
[3:43:46] <+Puffen0> whats the bet that this corrupts his save?
[3:43:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaBig psaGoblin
[3:43:49] <peachy996> @StaceMcGate I dunno Grunt is pretty tanky compared to Mordin
[3:43:54] <%DianaTheAscian> Goblins are winning and the piss canons are prob firing
[3:43:54] <SpaceGuntank> @plaguedoctor_syan that doesnt mean its not infuriating to see every time.
[3:44:02] <%Gamblitz> @Captainahab_37 Are you a Jade Golem cheater man as well?
[3:44:08] <%pokefan9956> >playthrough end
[3:44:10] <LluthyY> Big cheats are pats thing lol
[3:44:16] <%justnathan18> So has he only gotten Grunt so far this stream?
[3:44:17] <knight_verse> Pat lost the war to the goblins long ago
[3:44:18] <%ExpressNode> So I missed a lot of the Nintendo but looking at the news its probably some of the best they brought in a while.
[3:44:21] <peachy996> Besides you know that wouldn't matter. Cant stop da goblins
[3:44:21] <%StaceMcGate> @peachy996 Pat's character is a Tank, not a good team comp to have 2 tanks
[3:44:25] <$Captainahab_37> i only am cheater man in bethesda games
[3:44:31] <$ZeOrbling> hey chat, did i miss DBD?
[3:44:34] <%X2Eliah> !uptime
[3:44:34] <%DianaTheAscian> "So I did some cheating off stream"
[3:44:35] <@Moobot> @X2Eliah I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:36] <peachy996> He won't care
[3:44:38] <mattmmkay> and I think you'd like it because it's like persona
[3:44:43] <%pokefan9956> Nintendo direct was good. not the best ever, but good
[3:44:44] <%Ranryu692> @ZeOrbling yes
[3:44:44] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[3:44:46] <%Bt_Robot> psaBig Gotta Cheats
[3:44:48] <%StaceMcGate> just don't call out upgrades anymore LUL
[3:44:49] <%pokefan9956> solid 8 outta 10
[3:44:51] <$Ziegsy> yo chat, it was dark outside i blinked and its light. like someone flicked a switch. thats not normal.. right?
[3:44:52] <%X2Eliah> Oh jesus 3 hours? what did I miss??
[3:44:54] <%DorianCreed> @HitchhikingThrough I mean, this is pretty normal - he stops to go hard on the goblins all the time
[3:44:55] <$Captainahab_37> SMT V is real it exists
[3:44:55] <$ZeOrbling> ah darn, thanks
[3:45:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nobody EVER tell Pat that he's missed an upgrade again. THIS IS YOUR FAULT
[3:45:07] <%X2Eliah> @Ziegsy aliens
[3:45:09] <plaguedoctor_syan> @plaguedoctor_syan Been watching for almost 10 years now you get used to it
[3:45:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Hey chat check the time
[3:45:16] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD
[3:45:16] <SpaceGuntank> @X2Eliah he streamed the DbD Resident Evil update earlier
[3:45:18] <%DianaTheAscian> SMT V hype
[3:45:20] <$Ziegsy> @x2eliah
[3:45:22] <+Puffen0> @x2eliah not much, he played some dead by daylight to start off with
[3:45:24] <$Captainahab_37> i hope pat cheats MORE
[3:45:25] <$Ziegsy> aliens
[3:45:28] <$Captainahab_37> i hope pat plays in god mode
[3:45:29] <%ExpressNode> SMT V exists now Bayonetta 3 has no excuse
[3:45:30] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah ohhh ok
[3:45:31] <%pokefan9956> the big brain thing to do is tell pat he missed upgrades that don't exist
[3:45:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> should just stream the save editor
[3:45:32] <%DianaTheAscian> what about the time?
[3:45:33] <%X2Eliah> ok good
[3:45:44] <peachy996> I don't think this issue gets fixed in 3 does it? What happens if you miss guns in ME3?
[3:45:45] <knight_verse> Save scumming >>>>> Cheating
[3:45:46] <+trackles_64> Paige doesn't want to be in Gipsland Australia right now, spiders everywhere.
[3:45:47] <%pokefan9956> can we gaslight pat into thinking there's a party member he missed?
[3:45:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I hope editing this save file completely breaks Pat's game and he can't get any more upgrades ever.
[3:45:51] <$Ziegsy> omfg whoever pointed this out. thank you. kzxHelp ziegsyChaos
[3:45:58] <%NopeBadguy> stream over or just a brb?
[3:45:58] <ioci2112> I like grunt as a character, but stripping armor and shields fast is super important in me2, and he can't do it, so I never use him
[3:45:59] <$Captainahab_37> i hope next time we see his credits he has 999999999
[3:46:12] <+FlongBongle> @pokefan9956 doubt it
[3:46:14] <%DianaTheAscian> Would showing the save editor be a no no on twitch?
[3:46:17] <+amaranthos> Anyone know if woolie is still dead due to back injuries?
[3:46:17] <+Puffen0> @nopebadguy brb to use save editor
[3:46:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Captainahab_37 "so I did some.. grinding.."
[3:46:21] <%ComfortableStranger> @pokefan9956 no he's played this enough to know better
[3:46:21] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> cant wait for this to break pat's save
[3:46:21] <SpaceGuntank> if you're bustingn out the save editor might as well just put Legion in your party and max out your creds anyways.

[3:47:30] <peachy996> Delete ME2
[3:47:32] <+black_pariah> @PatStaresAt Did you know that the planned sequel to Jade Empire was going to be a western/cyberpunk noir? Look up project Revolver
[3:47:33] <knight_verse> Time to start over as a Sentinel
[3:47:34] <+Puffen0> you gotta start over from the beginning all over again now OMEGALUL
[3:47:35] <%NopeBadguy> I TRIED TO HELP YOU
[3:47:37] <SpaceGuntank> @Afterman_ he missed a minor health upgrade for a party member and tried to cheat engine it back into the game. didnt work.
[3:47:37] <MayorRev> Delete save and uninstall
[3:47:38] <Broken_Sonex> *Sigh* time to restart from ME1 I guess
[3:47:38] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You know you can just redo that mission
[3:47:39] <Vantesla> @mikesumusprime You can randomly buy weapon upgrades from the Shadow Broker DLC. But those can be additional to getting all.
[3:47:44] <+morningmoondude> i just got in what happened
[3:47:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, I'm happy only because the goblins were denied.
[3:47:56] <+Puffen0> its not even a good upgrade @patstaresat tbf
[3:48:01] <%NateyBeak> just reload n do it all, we would watch!
[3:48:03] <knight_verse> Just redo the mission and skip all the dialogue.
[3:48:06] <LeotheHuntsman> just load the save
[3:48:08] <%X2Eliah> Like reload a save before it and replay it
[3:48:10] <%JoshManVGH> how far back do your saves go?
[3:48:15] <SpaceGuntank> oh, right yeah you can just do the Shadowbroker DLC for free shit
[3:48:16] <$lotharrio> But what if he needs it, @Puffen0 ?
[3:48:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't tell him to reload a fucking save.
[3:48:26] <%CalderGaming> @Puffen0 OCD does not care
[3:48:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> He might do it.
[3:48:27] <$Captainahab_37> isnt this why you rotate saves
[3:48:35] <knight_verse> This is why you save in fron of every door.
[3:48:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Told you, all the time you thought you were saving for the Lp, you lost trying to rush him from his goblins
[3:48:37] <%pokefan9956> restart the game
[3:48:42] <%StaceMcGate> there's 2 and they stack
[3:48:43] <knight_verse> *front

[3:48:56] <%X2Eliah> maybe 3
[3:48:56] <knight_verse> There's 2 and they stack
[3:48:56] <$Captainahab_37> if a game gives me unlimited saves, its a nightmare
[3:48:56] <%Garthunox> There's 2
[3:48:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah there are 2
[3:48:58] <Grandnatics> They totally stack

[3:49:00] <Burger_Bonanza> there are 2 in the game, they stack for a total of 50%
[3:49:02] <Vantesla> 2 they stack from recollection
[3:49:04] <$lotharrio> They have different prices in this guide I'm looking at.

[3:50:47] <+SinnerEbru> DAMN pat, sorry buddy
[3:50:47] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Recommend doing Kasumi's loyalty mission first. She gives you arguably the best submachine gun in the game.

[3:51:02] <%ExpressNode> I was on a different tab, what is he doing?
[3:51:02] <+capnbeefs> Fucking coward
[3:51:03] <%Garthunox> Ok seriously whats the problem with jack?
[3:51:04] <+black_pariah> @PatStaresAt Did you know that the planned sequel to Jade Empire was going to be a western/cyberpunk noir? Look up project Revolver.
[3:51:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I told you
[3:51:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat has been defeated by the Mind Goblins.
[3:51:09] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt What's your thoughts on Mass Effect Next? I'm not sure if you saw the trailer or not.
[3:51:10] <Wolfstriker121> BRIGHT
[3:51:14] <Pookiedaexzile> I fucking called that shit from space
[3:51:16] <Broken_Sonex> So THIS is a broken man....
[3:51:21] <%justnathan18> Jacks Hot Topic edgy
[3:51:31] <DartAran> Jack is the best character who deserved better than coward writers
[3:51:31] <%PatNTheHat> @Garthunox I think he just doesn't like her design
[3:51:32] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh no what’s happening
[3:51:36] <%Monkeyweed21> this kinda pathetic ngl
[3:51:40] <thetunnelhomer> I think that's just the trailer
[3:51:41] <%ape_hawk> its ME4
[3:51:41] <Profmcstevie> the fuck is a western cyberpunk noir genre even at that point
[3:51:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is not Edgey
[3:51:43] <Grandnatics> Just cheat!
[3:51:48] <peachy996> When's the last time you people have been to a Hot Topic
[3:51:50] <+Puffen0> esfandRage do it you coward Kappa
[3:51:50] <%StaceMcGate> oh no...
[3:51:51] <%Faustgesicht> Many
[3:51:53] <%pokefan9956> pat, ya gotta get some CBT man
[3:51:55] <Pookiedaexzile> People think she's edge because she calls your dick small
[3:51:56] <Broken_Sonex> @Garthunox It's pretty bad tbf
[3:51:59] <+Grayhammatter> many
[3:52:00] <%JoshManVGH> Many
[3:52:02] <Zalapski> jack sucks
[3:52:03] <medoodoo> AWHH MAN WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO JACK MISSION
[3:52:06] <%ComfortableStranger> theres two geth shield boosts
[3:52:11] <thehullowed> You could get it off screen if possible.
[3:52:14] <+Puffen0> @patstaresat why do you hate jack?
[3:52:15] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile She's a tryhard
[3:52:16] <%DianaTheAscian> Last hot topic I was in was 5 years ago
[3:52:22] <medoodoo> No jack rules!
[3:52:25] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Omg is he reloading the last save on that okeer mission LUL
[3:52:26] <+black_pariah> is this desync just on my end or are you all seeing that
[3:52:26] <%justnathan18> Jacks mission is cool, it’s just sucks that it’s for Jack
[3:52:27] <plaguedoctor_syan> @pokefan9956 Im sorry, what?
[3:52:34] <peachy996> @Broken_Sonex At what?
[3:52:37] <%ComfortableStranger> 2nd play through IIRC
[3:52:38] <%NopeBadguy> Geth Pulse Rifle is outclassed by the Hattock, at least for Soldier
[3:52:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah but the geth SHOTGUN was DLC I think
[3:52:44] <medoodoo> he's goona do that okeer mission offline
[3:52:50] <Wolfstriker121> did chat legit broke pat?
[3:52:54] <%StaceMcGate> Playthrough cancelled
[3:52:54] <%pokefan9956> @plaguedoctor_syan cognitive behavioral therapy. good for OCD
[3:52:54] <%ComfortableStranger> GPR is not great
[3:52:54] <+Puffen0> yall are crazy, Jack is so cool imo
[3:52:56] <%Arkfyre> gath pulse rifle is not the same as the geth shotgun, which is dlc
[3:52:57] <Slim_Lipid> @pokefan9956 cannabis treats :)
[3:53:00] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You can get the Geth Pulse Rifle by just changing the difficulty before you go into Tali's mission
[3:53:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat broke Pat.
[3:53:03] <ScreamLord> You have to go into Tali's mission on Hardcore difficulty or higher
[3:53:04] <medoodoo> jack is coolll
[3:53:04] <%X2Eliah> @Wolfstriker121 pat broke pat
[3:53:05] <%heartlesshealer> just got here, how excited should I be for the vod?
[3:53:07] <Vantesla> shotgun dlc the rifle base game difficulty specific
[3:53:13] <peachy996> Grunt won't die from this
[3:53:14] <olaksi> this is not a goblin friendly game
[3:53:15] <SovPho> At least it's just equipment and not a storyline element. Upgrades in ME2 on any difficulty other than the harder ones are just icing.
[3:53:21] <%Frodiddly> Casey Hudson killed Mass Effect 3 because someone missed an upgrade in 2
[3:53:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Thanks, one guy
[3:53:24] <%justnathan18> Jack is like if Hellboys girlfriend got lost at the Warped tour
[3:53:36] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt Mass Effect Next is Mass Effect 5. The trailer is on the Mass Effect YouTube page
[3:53:36] <%NopeBadguy> I don't see them in the merchants or upgrade guides @PatStaresAt
[3:53:43] <+Puffen0> why do you hate jack tho? @patstaresat
[3:53:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You can get the Geth Pulse Rifle by just changing the difficulty before you go into Tali's mission
[3:53:53] <$lotharrio> ME3 you can just buy them later. I think that's what got people confused.
[3:53:58] <Pookiedaexzile> @Broken_Sonex No, When most people first meet her they are,
[3:53:59] <+RowenCleric> sad pat makes me sad
[3:54:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> or extremely thorough yes
[3:54:02] <$lotharrio> Or do a NG+, yeah.
[3:54:03] <SovPho> basically yeah
[3:54:04] <%TheCallousKing> yup
[3:54:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Most people don't care.
[3:54:07] <%StaceMcGate> or just look around before going to objectives
[3:54:09] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[3:54:10] <+EmptyMug> Just don't have mindgoblins
[3:54:14] <SaltyAzteca> yes actually
[3:54:14] <%ComfortableStranger> I remeber where they all are so no
[3:54:16] <%maenos2> I mean if you're thorough you're fine
[3:54:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> does this game have a 100% meter anywhere or
[3:54:18] <%heartlesshealer> TvTropes: GuideDangIt
[3:54:19] <%Garthunox> no, you just look around
[3:54:19] <+wmeldrum> that's bad design
[3:54:21] <+PatNTheHat> I mean, if you're cra... oh
[3:54:21] <%justnathan18> Could just look around lol
[3:54:21] <Slim_Lipid> isn't mass effect great :)
[3:54:22] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt I mean missed weapons show up in normandy storeman in ME3, but ME2 if you miss it its gone
[3:54:23] <Vantesla> DLC has added extra chances for some upgrades. Zaeed has a choice of heavy weapon upgrade or rifle upgrade. can't get both. Renegade for rifle and Paragon for Renegade if I recall.
[3:54:25] <%StaceMcGate> most upgrades are so minor that it doesn't matter
[3:54:29] <%Bt_Robot> No, just check the eniroronment for interactables
[3:54:32] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> They're hard to miss, though.
[3:54:35] <plaguedoctor_syan> @pokefan9956 Ah yes! To be fair the other CBT might just cure OCD, since you mind might just break because of it
[3:54:35] <+wmeldrum> there's probably a console command to get the upgrade
[3:54:40] <%dd44dostivei> i mean FF7 is worse because they're actually good items
[3:54:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> you know you are
[3:54:45] <%JoshManVGH> Nah, I just go and look at stuff. Probably missed a bunch.
[3:54:45] <%ComfortableStranger> Pat what do you do when you miss dark souls items?
[3:54:45] <peachy996> I think Jack just rubs you guys the wrong way, Shame. She gets a good arc in 3
[3:54:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat are you STILL going to be upset about this next Mass Effect stream?
[3:54:48] <%NopeBadguy> While we're on the topic, activating Lair of the Shadow Broker will skip Liara's base game quests on Illium.
[3:54:48] <romc215> the bane of the completionist
[3:54:55] <+Puffen0> it can be easy to miss tbf
[3:54:58] <%JoshManVGH> Good stream!
[3:55:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is the Gobliniest it's been in a WHILE
[3:55:00] <%toolofparanoia> mass effect 2 is one of those games that dunks on goldfish brains like me
[3:55:02] <peachy996> I enjoyed the Goblins that showed their heads
[3:55:04] <$Futurecity10> mind goblin overload
[3:55:06] <MayorRev> CHAOS
[3:55:07] <+SinnerEbru> we love u buddy, just. woof, yknow
[3:55:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack rubs a certain type of dude the wrong way
[3:55:11] <%DianaTheAscian> You don't have a save you can go back to?
[3:55:14] <%ComfortableStranger> @NopeBadguy the hacking mission yes
[3:55:14] <+Grayhammatter> CHAOS
[3:55:15] <Jahomono> we love the content even with mind goblins
[3:55:16] <%StaceMcGate> ?
[3:55:20] <medoodoo> are you gonna do the jack mission eventually?
[3:55:26] <MayorRev> Brain = Chaos
[3:55:29] <%DianaTheAscian> what?
[3:55:32] <Seth_Tek> Thoughts on Aunty Donna - The Magical dead cat tour?
[3:55:39] <peachy996> I mean you have to.
[3:55:39] <%pokefan9956> chaos?
[3:55:39] <%Ravioli_Ronin> No one say anything about missing anything going forward LUL
[3:55:41] <%dd44dostivei> i had to play FF7 with an item guide
[3:55:41] <+Puffen0> capcom has no idea what they are doing
[3:55:48] <Pookiedaexzile> I told you to just let him go back
[3:55:49] <peachy996> It progresses the story
[3:55:50] <Afterman_> go bust some karas
[3:55:55] <%Bt_Robot> Whatever you do, don't replay the entire game up to this point just to get one upgrade.
[3:55:59] <medoodoo> damn ok
[3:56:02] <SovPho> Did you beat Days Gone?
[3:56:03] <+D00msDayDan> that was when you thought your sub notifications were broken
[3:56:06] <%ComfortableStranger> I gifted a sub too...
[3:56:07] <Pookiedaexzile> but nooooo, we're gonna defeat his mind goblins with chat
[3:56:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Unless Pat misses another upgrade.
[3:56:10] <%pokefan9956> I'm happy giving capcom a pass. they're localizing great ace attorney
[3:56:17] <s1rcuit> hope your mood improves Pat
[3:56:21] <romc215> Cohesive streams are overrated. Disjointed screwing up is way more interesting
[3:56:31] <peachy996> Who is Lord Cyber Pat?
[3:56:41] <medoodoo> redo the okeer mission offline pat just do it its okay
[3:56:42] <+Puffen0> @patstaresat what happens if you miss another upgrade?
[3:56:47] <%justnathan18> Jack is Shadow the Hedgehog with a worse arc
[3:56:58] <%HitchhikingThrough> Pat Snaps At
[3:57:00] <%JoshManVGH> Man, I'm really digging the Job system in CHAOS.
[3:57:08] <Profmcstevie> Guide it
[3:57:13] <+Grayhammatter> Pat Snaps At
[3:57:13] <akitanito> just keep a sheet around
[3:57:17] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat kills the lp
[3:57:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Goblins are screaming in Pat's head right now.
[3:57:23] <+Puffen0> oof, I'd keep a guide on my phone
[3:57:24] <%pokefan9956> has pat killed chaos
[3:57:28] <+black_pariah> toilet cereal??  man i must have missed some crazy talk earlier in this stream
[3:57:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> yeeee
[3:57:40] <+Puffen0> hey congrats dood!
[3:57:41] <HaroldDonchee> I figured a 2nd one wouldn't hurt as much since it's already fucked
[3:57:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack isn't edgey, you were edgey when you played with her character, Its called misplaced embarrassment
[3:57:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> ok have a good night people
[3:57:54] <peachy996> @justnathan18 But that's wrong.
[3:57:55] <jorniev> OH did pat whent back or did he cheat?
[3:58:18] <%pokefan9956> @jorniev neither. mind goblins won
[3:58:21] <%Pandybun> Cheer1000 Mass Effect Next is Mass Effect 5. The trailer is on Mass Effect's YouTube page
[3:58:22] <@StridentSong> Nox is streaming if you want to raid him
[3:58:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat do not corrupt your save.
[3:58:26] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Cheer tansy5Cheer tansy5Cheer
[3:58:29] <%maskofmichael> Replay the whole game
[3:58:29] <+Puffen0> @jorniev the save editor didn't work the first time
[3:58:30] <%heartlesshealer> toilet cereal was the stream where Pat revealed that Paige had come home from the US
[3:58:33] <%ComfortableStranger> nite chat!
[3:58:34] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt It might be quicker to redo it
[3:58:36] <%justnathan18> I never used Jack. Becauuuuse she was so edgy
[3:58:39] <Wolfstriker121> ELMO!
[3:58:39] <peachy996> Liara and Talimancers must hate Jack.
[3:58:42] <%Frodiddly> Byeee Patty and everyone
[3:58:46] <%DorianCreed> But yeah, night nerds
[3:58:48] <MayorRev> STFU ELMO
