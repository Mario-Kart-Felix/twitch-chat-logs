[0:37:15] <Omega1180> just saw the review from skill up and thought of you... and here we are.
[0:37:16] <%valriot> Can you imagine punching someone's arm on purpose?
[0:37:17] <%Sokumotanaka> They thought it be funny
[0:37:20] <%AncelDeLambert> the guy from the last game was wheelchair bound at the start, then got his suit
[0:37:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Doctor was Russian. Probably was drunk and thought it was funny.
[0:37:22] <$Bearjewpiter> moon2BRAIN don't punch my head man
[0:37:23] <%starotter70> It seemed like a good plan in the moment

[0:38:27] <cronicconquest> Just like you pat weak as baby shit
[0:38:28] <%RubberFistFight> @rufus2k2 he really should look into running a dual-pc setup. He has most of the hardware for it already (capture card, mixer, etc). It eliminates the problems OBS has with hooking the video of certain games, since the second PC is just capturing a feed from the first PC.
[0:38:28] <%asmistake> needs the half life medikit sound

[0:50:53] <deviljhojho94> good thing we know nothing about the first game
[0:50:54] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo Dark Souls gives you warnings at 25% so you run less risk of breaking your weapons, and RDR2 has the "weapon needs to be cleaned" mechanic which, whilst annoying, is semi-realistic and at least doesn't totally stop you dealing damage, just reduces it a bit.
[0:50:55] <%DedlokPM> Benjamin Burke was the guy who was talking to you via the loudspeakers in the dirst one offering you a way out, but he bitches out and leaves you before you reach him. @AngriestPat

[0:51:13] <%Solidnick18> creo some shit
[0:51:22] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo games that do it BADLY have the "3 hits and your weapon breaks forever" mechanic.

[0:53:39] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat LOL DRG
[0:53:40] <%Solidnick18> the spear is really good
[0:53:41] <Taffer85> loved staves in the first one
[0:53:41] <%C0baltCrusade> knife on a stick
[0:53:42] <+pendragone> The coward's weapon, good choice
[0:53:43] <tigerfang86> BLUE LIONS CREW REPRESENT LANCES
[0:53:44] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, that's convenient
[0:53:46] <Valdorick> Spears - the real weapon of the ancient world.
[0:53:47] <popooppaix1> it sticks to your ass
[0:53:50] <%wickerguy> Give em the ole GAE BOLG
[0:53:52] <%valriot> Use High Jump
[0:53:52] <+Zereaux> ITS A SHARD OF GLASS TAPED TO A STICK
[0:53:52] <@lewdskeletor13> The way you holster the spear is goofy LUL
[0:53:53] <redsynod> sweet polearm representation
[0:53:54] <%DedlokPM> And if you collect something you already have it gets converted to upgrade parts for your shit
[0:53:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Pointy thing on stick is classic.

[0:54:43] <pixelkenj> @AngriestPat do you still have jump/duck or has this replaced the system
[0:54:48] <redsynod> It's the PEOPLE'S weapon
[0:54:50] <%Svanyr> Shyet
[0:54:50] <%TheMattman1313> Looks like they threw in For Honor into Souls
[0:54:51] <+LotusGramarye> they had directional blocking/dodging in the first one, with special followups when u did it
[0:54:53] <%BioApple> always make sure to spend your built-up charges
[0:54:54] <Taffer85> take evasive shits
[0:54:54] <%Divryne> Is that just a For Honor parry?

[0:55:10] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:55:13] <%iamtrlly> Like the first game

[0:55:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @iamtrlly No
[0:55:22] <KoryMccool> all these good animations look so silly when used by normal man guy
[0:55:28] <T_Sasquatch> seems like they actually improved on the first game , good to see
[0:55:29] <Oughtist> @AngriestPat Jump is left stick pressed
[0:55:37] <beetbo2> The exoskeleton gives us the power
[0:55:38] <%BioApple> that is an absurdly fast jab for how big that spear is
[0:55:45] <+d00msdaydan> just woke up from a coma, now doing sick pole vaults with a spear
[0:55:46] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s already played the game before
[0:55:50] <%Sokumotanaka> So are the autosaves forgiving? The last game's autosaves were like hours back
[0:55:52] <Ralfclogs> It's not a regular war, its a space war!
[0:55:52] <%Solidnick18> yo
[0:55:59] <bashful_bard> That's nifty
[0:56:00] <%Solidnick18> that was pretty cool
[0:56:02] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> mk 2
[0:56:03] <@lewdskeletor13> @ralfclogs A SPACE WAR?
[0:56:05] <tigerfang86> the space war starts NOOOOOOOW
[0:56:08] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo what I dislike is wasteful and restrictive crafting mechanics. Like in The Last of Us. You use a PAIR of scissors to make a single shiv (when separating the blades would make 2) and the game behaves as if you can't use the bits of glass or metal or anything lying around to make them. Basically the characters are the worst scavengers in existence yet we're somehow to believe they survived the zombie apocalypse?
[0:56:08] <%StaceMcGate> When you walk away, you won't hear me say
[0:56:11] <fIashman92> So this is basically Cyborg Justice 2?
[0:56:20] <%InugamiTheHound> pat is pulling off dynasty warriors moves
[0:56:22] <%AncelDeLambert> no, seriously, is this fucker Bruce Lee or some shit?
[0:56:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Think I might consider picking up the game when I have more money, I like how it's looking so far
[0:56:23] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Yeah know Warren should have died from a massive infection considering the bolts for his exosuit were screwed into his bones THROUGH his fucking jumpsuit! I don't think nylon fibers or whatever inside you is good for you
[0:56:23] <Smart_ZaK1> Silky smooth
[0:56:24] <%Sokumotanaka> That's legit a monster!

[0:57:05] <Smart_ZaK1> Wow you Darth Mauled his shit
[0:57:12] <%RubberFistFight> @ShichiNoBushi pyramid head should only exist in james sunderland's version of silent hill. putting him in other games was a mistake.
[0:57:14] <%DedlokPM> @T_Sasquatch If it is like the first one, the only RNG involved in getting armor off the enemies is sometimes the enemies will respawn with armor on different limbs than before. If you cut off the limb you are guaranteed to get the armor/weapon on equipped on it
[0:57:19] <%Laecerelius> to encourage being a bit risky with your scrap souls
[0:57:20] <%iamtrlly> I hope Peach is feeling better today.
[0:57:21] <Darkrenai> First game was what, 2017 sometime?
[0:57:23] <%mayorrev> darth maul?

[0:57:58] <%AncelDeLambert> the biggest flaw I think that Metal Gear Rising has is that there's no pistol guy. No Revolver Ocelot type
[0:57:59] <T_Sasquatch> @DedlokPM good to know, i literally stopped playing the surge 1 demo when i realised there was rng in cutting stuff off
[0:57:59] <pixelkenj> but its FUTURE TAPE

[1:01:24] <+whiskywolfe> Ah yes, Warden Garcia. Surely this will be one of the great bosses.
[1:01:26] <%kiiiirsten> Wow this boss has a Warm Liquid Goo phase
[1:01:26] <%starotter70> I want the Juice
[1:01:29] <%AncelDeLambert> so, photograph the enemy for gear?
[1:01:31] <%Sokumotanaka> How do you get the drone?
[1:01:31] <T_Sasquatch> circle strafe bby
[1:01:32] <%Jrocy247> GRENADE LAUNCHER
[1:01:34] <%CalderGaming> that's a much better system
[1:01:38] <%DedlokPM> The weird conditions in the 1st one was for more powerful versions of the boss weapon
[1:01:41] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so this is basically Monster Dark Hunter Souls? Kappa
[1:01:41] <%floralkami> @angriestpat the word you want is "Pilebunker"
[1:01:41] <%Jrocy247> BALLS EXPOSED
[1:01:43] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat can you kill the drone?
[1:01:44] <%dukenux> oh he has a little drone too?
[1:01:48] <tigerfang86> Just Win
[1:01:48] <ZComiX> CAN YOU GET THE DRONE?
[1:01:49] <%TheHoodedTeddy13> This game looks pretty good actually, it on PS4?
[1:01:50] <+CaptainGrime> @AncelDeLambert no chop it off for gear
[1:01:54] <+Grayhammatter> why would you want to do that?
[1:01:55] <%BoboDaHobo> @rubberfistfight No, we only use scissors. You can't cut anyone with glass, that's ridiculous
[1:02:03] <%mayorrev> oh dear
[1:02:07] <%Sokumotanaka> Did pay say heal?
[1:02:14] <%VantomPayne> huh, i feel like you are much faster than you were in 1
[1:02:14] <%Laecerelius> If this is like the first game you'll eventually get your own drone that lets you do ranged attacks
[1:02:14] <FriendlyLich> souls
[1:02:18] <bashful_bard> This music's pretty ok
[1:02:20] <%valriot> Great Lord Garcia
[1:02:20] <%floralkami> FUCK HIS SHIT UP
[1:02:21] <%Sokumotanaka> yeah I can see it
[1:02:23] <%StaceMcGate> This fucking dude is just shimmying around at the speed of light
[1:02:25] <deviljhojho94> but sekiro came out this year no?
[1:02:25] <%InugamiTheHound> why does this game art style reminds me of "Too Human"
[1:02:28] <RagingLeo> so now I totally wanna get it
[1:02:28] <@JustinianKnight> yea the parry
[1:02:29] <+Hydralord89> can you redo the fight after you beat him and get the other parts?
[1:02:31] <%valriot> Sekiro doodSick doodSick
[1:02:34] <%Jrocy247> Does he have Poise damage?
[1:02:34] <Owlboy7> how do pat know the game already?
[1:02:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wouldn't they have been created almost simultaneously?
[1:02:36] <ToneBacas> how so?
[1:02:37] <%AncelDeLambert> god, I hate floor spam
[1:02:40] <nuane> any game with parrying is now a Sekiro clone
[1:02:40] <+Grayhammatter> huh, weird
[1:02:41] <+CaptainGrime> @TheHoodedTeddy13 yes
[1:02:42] <%TheHoodedTeddy13> I mean, Sekiro does involve arms being cut off too
[1:02:43] <blackbaron98> This seems ALOT more fast paced
[1:02:43] <Rashnam> the parry looks a lot let complicated than the first game
[1:02:43] <+Mcmoblin> Parry good = do the damage
[1:02:47] <Smart_ZaK1> He has been playing it all week
[1:02:48] <deviljhojho94> Pat predicted this game with his powers
[1:02:50] <Rashnam> less*
[1:02:53] <%DedlokPM> @Owlboy7 he has played it for an hour before he played it on stream
[1:02:53] <deviljhojho94> thats why he knows the mechanics
[1:02:54] <%TheHoodedTeddy13> @CaptainGrime Thankyou
[1:02:55] <FriendlyLich> @deviljhojho94 its fine, its just pat being wrong
[1:02:55] <T_Sasquatch> honestly after playing bloodborne , dark souls feels lesser in comparison
[1:02:55] <%Sokumotanaka> If THIS was the first game I wouldn't be so skeptical of the series for the lack of a better term
[1:02:57] <beetbo2> Cumbo parry?
[1:03:00] <QaizerArt> @Owlboy7 He got the game early to make sure it ran well so he played it all weekend
[1:03:00] <beetbo2> hamp Pog
[1:03:00] <eco419> Pat is a god goblin
[1:03:07] <deviljhojho94> @FriendlyLich Oh I got worried for a second 4Head
[1:03:08] <%DedlokPM> @Owlboy7 aka he got a key early from the devs
[1:03:10] <snowmangod> it's kinda weird that there's a studio just out here making new games within another studio's formula. Especially one that feels so niche.
[1:03:11] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo or how they clean their wounds by opening a bottle of rubbing alcohol and then EMPTYING THE WHOLE FUCKING THING OVER THEIR ARM. Like fuck. Use it SPARINGLY you post-apocalyptic dipshits.
[1:03:13] <%TomServal> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:03:15] <%TheHoodedTeddy13> I still say Dark Souls 1 felt the best gameplay wise
[1:03:15] <+PleasantLee> The direction hud on the parry system feels abit like the For Honor system too

[1:05:54] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo oh they also constantly re-use a single gas mask with filter cartridges that were invented BEFORE the fungus apocalypse, and have been in use for years. And it's the kind of cartridge you'd use for spray-painting a car. Which isn't actually rated for things like filtering out fungal spores.
[1:05:54] <%Kiiper> No, Sirens are straight up space magic

[1:08:09] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami sometimes I wonder if I'd enjoy games better if I didn't know stuff. :( In RDR2 I immediately gun down anyone I see that's been bitten by a snake or has their leg stuck in a bear trap that's begging for help because they aint surviving that shit in 1899 and it's a more merciful death if I just plug them. The game tries to tell me my mercy is somehow evil. So unfair.

[1:36:27] <%InugamiTheHound> so is this city instead the woolie hole?

[1:37:19] <Oughtist> To be fair the last one was pretty fucking obsessed with shortcuts aswell.
[1:37:22] <%idyota> did you ever play the original's dlc?

[1:43:04] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> aout
[1:43:04] <%SWFanatic> Pat is Asshole confirmed
[1:43:07] <Smart_ZaK1> Stroke?
[1:43:07] <RyuuAoi> We Dark Souls tonight.
[1:43:07] <Ner234> Stroke?
[1:43:10] <+bobfriskit> wait I forget, where did he put it?
[1:43:10] <+CaptainGrime> wink if your having a stroke
[1:43:13] <KishinGrek> How is this compared to surge 1?
[1:43:15] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I mean, in order to find it you have to buy the game LUL
[1:43:15] <Morbidmort> @Deft_Thought that's the way they do it
[1:43:15] <%king_wragles> Good thing there aren't 1,300 people watching who now know this 'secret'
[1:43:17] <+Clik404> @smart_zak1 Canadian
[1:43:19] <KaliasTV> Chat is already putting graffiti up pointing to your hiding spot
[1:43:19] <redsynod> That's the dutch coming out
[1:43:20] <kwangalang> Aout
[1:43:21] <Valdorick> But see pat, the thing about hide and seek is - if you show everyone the best hiding spot, it becomes the WORST hiding spot.
[1:43:22] <%joylent_blue> see that stroke? don't worry about that
[1:43:22] <%ThePuddingDead> well ok
[1:43:25] <babypie1988> Pat your cool
[1:43:28] <%Bad1uck> Pat is turning into Ahti
[1:43:29] <%Deft_Thought> Looks weird
[1:43:29] <+BLK_HRLQN_13> just like dark souls
[1:43:31] <ScrubVerseVet> How are we liking The Surge 2?
[1:43:38] <+CounterBeard> I like the look of that spear. Looks pokey
[1:43:44] <+RadicalPirate> I just saw Pat's going to play Untitled Goose Game on Saturday....Awww yiss
[1:43:52] <AstratesticoMan> !Surge2
[1:43:53] <@Moobot> Hey if you think this is cool, you can check out Surge 2 here: http://bit.ly/2Q4O6s2 - Sponsored by Focus Home Interactive
[1:43:55] <puse9> you got the arm already
[1:44:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Now I want to see graffiti that's a tutorial message in real life.
[1:44:03] <%PatIsMyHero> Me. I care.
[1:44:07] <+bobfriskit> Does this character also live in a wheelchair?
[1:44:08] <Tucker0603> wait what? you have the arm???
[1:44:08] <Smart_ZaK1> Pat you already got the arm
[1:44:11] <Morbidmort> "Need the head or body or legs, so we'll go for the arm"
[1:44:11] <romaine420> I thought this was astral chain lmfao
[1:44:11] <Valdorick> GUN
[1:44:17] <%Laecerelius> HE has a gun!
[1:44:19] <%StaceMcGate> FAILED
[1:44:23] <%Solidnick18> boo
[1:44:24] <KishinGrek> Oh its sponsored? Nice
[1:44:45] <Tucker0603> is pats brain going bad?
[1:44:48] <st_jimmy456> that was fast
[1:44:50] <%Dr_Mooose> ow
[1:44:55] <KishinGrek> That Good or bad?
[1:44:57] <waifoong98> black knights throw molotov???
[1:45:02] <%dalmek> OH
[1:45:04] <%Bad1uck> @laecerelius correction: he has a FIREARM mwahaha
[1:45:04] <Omega1180> oof
[1:45:06] <Ner234> DED
[1:45:16] <Unimpressions> so like a chain bonus
[1:45:17] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat if you die does the bonus go away?
[1:45:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> cleva
[1:45:18] <%furiousfurioso> ohhhhh
[1:45:19] <kwangalang> Kick that chest in
[1:45:20] <star_feline> NICE
[1:45:24] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I like that system
[1:45:28] <%zamzoph> But GREED tho
[1:45:29] <%dalmek> so, basically, the longer you go without using a Med Station, the bigger your multiplier
[1:45:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a neat incentive, I like it
[1:45:31] <%joylent_blue> apatBig GREED system
[1:45:31] <zenith0111> MORE MONEY = MOAR MUNEY
[1:45:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Risk vs. Reward
[1:45:47] <%PatIsMyHero> apatBig TakeNRG
[1:45:52] <Moonlight_Grimoire> yeah, that is a great system
[1:45:58] <Morbidmort> But Number Go Down syndrome
[1:46:00] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> greed mechanics
[1:46:00] <+CounterBeard> DIdn't remnant do that too?
[1:46:01] <star_feline> Is this gonna be a goblin problem?
[1:46:02] <Moonlight_Grimoire> makes farming much more enjoable
[1:46:02] <%StaceMcGate> big oof
[1:46:04] <KishinGrek> High risk high reward
[1:46:04] <%dalmek> the true Greedfall was The Surge 2 we made along the way
[1:46:05] <+bobfriskit> How does Pat know so much about this game?
[1:46:11] <%joylent_blue> camera goes into the toilet
[1:46:16] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Yo that guy ded jermaPluto
[1:46:17] <n3xus_nitro> just like the first game
[1:46:18] <zv1neda> go in raw
[1:46:20] <+BishopBain> Camera literally in the shitter
[1:46:23] <AstratesticoMan> This game seems way better than the first one
[1:46:23] <%dalmek> @bobfriskit he played it off stream all weekend
[1:46:27] <%Zombrocom> @bobfriskit He been playing it for a few days
[1:46:28] <%Kiiper> Pat played this first area over the weekend
[1:46:30] <+CaptainGrime> @bobfriskit cause he played the first one and did the enitre first area of this game off stream
[1:46:32] <%Bad1uck> Pat spent all weekend playing this
[1:46:34] <3xgilly> will enemies still progressively drop more scrap the further you go like in souls?
[1:46:44] <%floralkami> @bobfriskit he played it over the weekend on PC, with the sponsored key
[1:46:48] <+bobfriskit> Pat plays games off stream?!
[1:46:56] <%Zombrocom> All the time
[1:46:59] <+bobfriskit> whaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:47:04] <KishinGrek> Is this deck13s best "souls" game?
[1:47:12] <$OranHexthief> if anyone at fromsoft has played this game then that risk system in particular might make an appearance in elden ring unless they went crazy on difficulty for some reason and can't do it cause it would piss off too many people
[1:47:16] <%drabberfaun535> why is the white scale so high? the pavement looks neon white and super bright
[1:47:16] <+bobfriskit> jk
[1:47:19] <Ner234> MY LEG
[1:47:21] <%Jolnir> robo souls
[1:47:24] <%floralkami> @bobfriskit i don't think the joke "grinding off screen" would work if not
[1:47:33] <%DedlokPM> @bobfriskit because a) its same as the first but better, b) he got an early key from the devs and played it for some time before the stream started
[1:47:34] <%CalderGaming> big dawg
[1:47:40] <%joylent_blue> christ
[1:47:44] <%dalmek> also the scarp thing is basically your Farming Multiplier

[1:47:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Leg got
[1:47:52] <%dalmek> Farm more to farm even more to farm more and more
[1:47:53] <Saltima> I know this is nitpicky but he already started dropping his weapon before you did the execution.

[2:07:43] <+Pomer> @skyle85 i think for the most part it only gets really rough if you're targeting 100+ FPS or 4K resolutions. 1080p 60 isn't too hard from what i heard/

[2:12:56] <%RubberFistFight> @Dysek89 you said it looked like a PS3 game. I challenge you to find a PS3 game from this genre that looks like this.
[2:12:57] <%PatIsMyHero> Gun gotta get the gun

[2:12:58] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> gund? pff, DRONES is where its at

[2:13:22] <Morbidmort> Cheese time!
[2:13:23] <Dysek89> @RubberFistFight it looks like EDF

[2:13:26] <T_Sasquatch> draw that aggro
[2:13:28] <KishinGrek> Big back down
[2:13:29] <+gryffon95> just parry the bullets
[2:13:33] <%DedlokPM> @brawlerforhire yes but he did not finish it
[2:13:38] <QaizerArt> silly @lewdskeletor13 you're a skeleton. you don't have eyes anyway!
[2:13:42] <+whiskywolfe> @brawlerforhire he did a long time ago.
[2:13:46] <%floralkami> @dysek89 okay THAT I have to disagree
[2:13:47] <%Kiiper> yaya
[2:13:49] <Moonlight_Grimoire> well he got the head
[2:13:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @qaizerart Fuq
[2:13:53] <+brawlerforhire> Did he not like it or something? I thought it was a lot of fun
[2:13:57] <%RubberFistFight> @Dysek89 mate if you can't tell the difference between 720p30 and 1080p60 I dunno what to tell you, besides the fact that it's not a problem with the game.
[2:14:03] <star_feline> Uh oh death incoming
[2:14:04] <%wolfofsound> guys please ignore the obvious bait
[2:14:08] <%floralkami> this does NOT look like EDF
[2:14:10] <%Nordguy> aw, how nice of them to give you two some space
[2:14:14] <RushUnplugged> dude has to be trolling
[2:14:15] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Is that a fucking Pilebunker?!
[2:14:21] <eco419> bad bait tbh
[2:14:22] <+Pomer> So they like, let him scope it out first a bit before doing the sponsorship? kinda cool of them.
[2:14:28] <%DedlokPM> @brawlerforhire less "didn't like it" and more "grew unintrested/new stuff came out"
[2:14:29] <+whiskywolfe> @brawlerforhire I think the verdict was ambitious but poorly executed and with a bunch of problems.
[2:14:29] <%floralkami> yeah, troll gonna troll I guess
[2:14:32] <+superkeaton> the shlooter
[2:14:33] <%TomServal> Pilebunkers are kings if weaponry.
[2:14:38] <QaizerArt> Actually yeah @AngriestPat is the pilebunker weapon worth using in this?
[2:14:47] <%Kiiper> I believe in performance mode that games runs at upscaled 720 at 60, while quality is 1080 at 30

[2:57:00] <%A_Zealous_Retort> zipping up and zipping down lines?
[2:57:03] <%starotter70> Did Sierra Mist die out? Haven't seen any in a while
[2:57:04] <+nekodelic> Pat is not a hooker yet
[2:57:07] <%Typhaeon> Lot more interesting level design than the firs game so far
[2:57:09] <Smart_ZaK1> It is that spongebob episode where Patrick eats the hooks

[2:57:51] <Smart_ZaK1> Jackdaw huh?
[2:58:00] <%DedlokPM> I can't wait for the twist that Blue Sparkle is made from Nanomachine blood and then the game completely ignore the implcations and ramifications that it being made from that be completely ignored
[2:58:02] <%joylent_blue> no its fine tho
[2:58:05] <%RubberFistFight> @waifoong98 head on, apply directly to forehead.

[3:01:08] <Valdorick> Revenge is here for you.
[3:01:14] <star_feline> @CourageTheCat Orwellian head implant
[3:01:14] <%Typhaeon> Revenge enemy? He mad you cut his head off?
[3:01:17] <%TheBitingIrish> Their helmets buff them, yeah?
[3:01:18] <%king_wragles> @lewdskeletor13 it's like the stand in name for a real drug in a child's cartoon.
[3:01:24] <eco419> DO IT
[3:01:27] <@lewdskeletor13> @king_wragles LUL
[3:01:30] <%starotter70> Wait a sec, Sierra Mist died, then became Mist Twist, then died again and became revived as Sierra Mist
[3:01:32] <%Laecerelius> Revenge enemies are ones that killed a player
[3:01:33] <%joylent_blue> pretty sure Blue Sparkle is a mlp character
[3:01:33] <SkreamnR3dSkull> Yeah! The SPLURGE :D
[3:01:33] <jamesofn> 0 damage
[3:01:39] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 it sounds like a schoolgirl dance troupe from the 80s LUL
[3:01:40] <waifoong98> @CrabSlacks I just imagine it as electrocuting
[3:01:45] <%starotter70> What a cycle of death and rebirth
[3:01:48] <@lewdskeletor13> @laecerelius The cycle of rebirth
[3:01:56] <%Laecerelius> They're buffed but they give you tons of loot when killed
[3:01:59] <SleepyMaribo> imagine an enemy thats just called revenge enemy
[3:02:07] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:02:11] <eco419> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:02:11] <%Zombrocom> One criticism I can put to this game so far, the music is pretty nothing
[3:02:12] <%TheBitingIrish> @starotter70 Mist Twist was a real stupid name anyways
[3:02:16] <star_feline> Tame_pear AVENGED
[3:02:21] <%DedlokPM> @Typhaeon nah. That means that enemy killed another player which means it is made tougher and you get more upgrade mats when you kill it
[3:02:31] <Lagseene> !Surge2
[3:02:32] <@Moobot> Hey if you think this is cool, you can check out Surge 2 here: http://bit.ly/2Q4O6s2 - Sponsored by Focus Home Interactive
[3:02:35] <waifoong98> the fuck is that guy using
[3:02:37] <%TheBitingIrish> omg is that a combination tennis racket/flyswatter?
[3:02:38] <%RubberFistFight> @starotter70 wait for them to release Sierra Mist Twist
[3:02:43] <VirtuaRailith> the parry system seems cool
[3:02:45] <%Typhaeon> Is joke but yeah it said as much after Pat put him down
[3:02:52] <@lewdskeletor13> Blue Sparkle is just the future version of the meth from Breaking Bad
[3:02:54] <%king_wragles> @SleepyMaribo so you can fight revenge Revenge Enemies?
[3:02:59] <eco419> thx for honor
[3:03:00] <neverforget2018> !Surge2
[3:03:05] <%joylent_blue> thats a bit shit
[3:03:08] <%Archmortal> That's a fucking Demon Souls ass gear set
[3:03:09] <Smart_ZaK1> LOL get poisoned for damage
[3:03:13] <%TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat Maybe there's a way to apply weak poison, like in Sekiro?
[3:03:14] <VirtuaRailith> @lewdskeletor13 it's the nanobot version of red ice from detroit become human
[3:03:19] <issaltar1> that's the worst sounding piece of gear ever
[3:03:21] <Onmi_Khaos> This game got a glam system?
[3:03:27] <@lewdskeletor13> @virtuarailith If only Hank was here
[3:03:27] <%hussdogrob> appropriate for a drug addict, poison yourself to be more powerful
[3:03:33] <%Bad1uck> Blight Town gear
[3:03:40] <%TheBitingIrish> Their helmets buff them, yeah? @AngriestPat
[3:03:46] <star_feline> The power of CRACK
[3:03:47] <%joylent_blue> Blue Evolve was a better drug name, and it wasnt even blue
[3:03:47] <xeros720> "they are really powerful when they are drugged out!" - Pat as he drinks his Red Bull
[3:03:48] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 he'd just be somewhere shouting at some lady about how they're not rocks, they're minerals.
[3:03:50] <jamesofn> i wish so many games didnt have the diablo loot shit,i really dont think it fits most genres especially this soulslike
[3:03:51] <reiju_22> shangl1Nap
[3:03:51] <+emperri> very big on drugs
[3:03:51] <%PanicSwytch> What kind of drugs
[3:03:55] <VirtuaRailith> @lewdskeletor13 i'd settle for sumo

[3:08:20] <KishinGrek> why is Ann drecher here?
[3:08:21] <%DedlokPM> @xeros720 so far it seems like the only relevant parts of surge 1 is mentioned at the very stuff, aka the end of the first one. The only other thing I can see you getting from playing Surge 1 before hand is saying "Hey! I know that guy!" when you run into Benjamin Burke and hear Warren's voice. That and know what the deal is with the nanomachines
[3:08:22] <%AncelDeLambert> She needs to be at least 20% More Harley Quinn
[3:08:24] <+whiskywolfe> lol guess i'm a hooker now
[3:08:28] <%king_wragles> D R U G S
[3:08:28] <Marpolo13> @Smart_ZaK1 that's not bad voice acting, that's a bad voice. it's different

[3:09:33] <KishinGrek> heheheheh long pork
[3:09:35] <VirtuaRailith> this game really reminds me of DS2 because the gameplay is better but the story and atmosphere seems way worse

[3:09:58] <%TheMattman1313> 0/10 No Med Bay Music

[3:10:11] <%joylent_blue> this seemed ill-advised
[3:10:15] <KishinGrek> DS2 wasn't wprse it was just poorly done
[3:10:19] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat This game feels like it was SUPPOSE to be a game about those edgey lego action figure things.

[3:11:13] <KitsuneManami> Hey Pat, do you guys have Bionicles in Canada?
[3:11:15] <AnDyLV> it looks like a more ''toy like'' toned Surge . imo

[3:11:26] <%starotter70> I miss Bionicles

[3:24:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Hi Rogue Process
[3:24:06] <%CyfnosWolfen> CyfnosWolfen subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:24:07] <+not_chase__> gen zoomer
[3:24:09] <PsychoFlash1> Gen X is millenials, which is between boomers and zoomers IIRC
[3:24:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @starotter70 about 99'ish
[3:24:13] <redsynod> Zoomers v Boomers
[3:24:16] <simulationbard> like '98
[3:24:19] <kingbaconcrispy> @starotter70 1995 I think
[3:24:19] <Hallommig> ah ty @Kiiper
[3:24:26] <+superdeliverer> The millenia I should think
[3:24:29] <kingbaconcrispy> Late 90's
[3:24:31] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Are there any annoying enemies/bosses like the 1st one with the giant fire robot?
[3:24:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Millenial ends like 97-98-99
[3:24:41] <+chrishnaw> @TheBitingIrish gen x is before millenials. Millenials are gen Y.
[3:24:46] <%RubberFistFight> @starotter70 depends on who you ask, but it usually starts at the early to mid 80s. I was born in 83, but apparently i just scraped into "millenial" according to the internet, so IDK.
[3:24:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> gen x is people born between 60s and 80s
[3:24:58] <%nofestu2> is that plague?
[3:25:01] <%Laecerelius> can you jump that gap?
[3:25:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Anyone who grew up with Social Media in Elementary school is a Gen Z
[3:25:06] <simulationbard> or 95 I could be wrong, all I know s I'm gen z
[3:25:16] <yourliteraldog> Is this warhammer 40K
[3:25:16] <+not_chase__> so after ten z are there no more generations?
[3:25:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> if you werent a kid in the 90s you retroactively dont exist
[3:25:22] <%AncelDeLambert> all you need to know, internet, is that the spread of what constitutes a "Millenial" is so wide as to make the distinction meaningless
[3:25:23] <PsychoFlash1> I'm from '99, am I a zoomer or millenial?
[3:25:25] <KaliasTV> Everyone gonna get nanite merged into the hivemind

[3:27:55] <%floralkami> while you were shooting guns, i studied the stick
[3:28:00] <%Monkeyweed21> the nanite shit was pobably the coolest part of surge 1
[3:28:00] <%starotter70> I think it says something about me that, when I was a kid, I was too scared to watch the Bionicle movie NotLikeThis
[3:28:06] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat btw, i know it's been a minute since you streamed it, but did you ever get done with Prey? My fiance' got it for my birthday last year and I just beat it 2 days ago. I'm glad I stuck with it, s'pretty good

[3:28:59] <Finakala> Waterfall caves must exist
[3:29:03] <@lewdskeletor13> @psychoflash1 That was creepy man
[3:29:04] <eyedol33> @lewdskeletor13 To be fair Willem Dafoe is horrifying
[3:29:10] <%startstoprepeat> how dare they hide a secret behind a waterfall
[3:29:17] <%joylent_blue> PsychoFlash1 ~ advanced darkness ~
[3:29:19] <Valdorick> If your childhood involved your parents having a Jeff Foxworthy CD full of "You might a Redneck if" jokes, You might be a millennial.

[3:29:25] <Louie_Salmon> Just tuning in, these immediately seems way smoother than the first game

[3:44:11] <Decsevm> I wish there were great bionicle game that people went back to, something like one of the final fantasy or maybe something like that one good sonic game
[3:44:12] <%Monkeyweed21> criminal meat only
[3:44:29] <%NeroInfinite> Tha thing is VERY much dead
[3:44:35] <NoirePanzer> Terminal Zed
[3:44:42] <%starotter70> @Decsevm Yeah, most of the games were alright at best
[3:44:44] <SpawnConnery> thought i saw a prompt in front of it briefly
[3:44:47] <Slim_Lipid> "Zee" DansGame
[3:44:47] <%joylent_blue> terminal zeyy
[3:44:55] <+Jimboq> just a few spurts of bioslime
[3:45:05] <%TheBitingIrish> Terminal ResidentSleeper
[3:45:08] <CrabSlacks> this game teaches you that green and purple things are bad
[3:45:10] <%Monkeyweed21> the poison was the friends we made along the way
[3:45:12] <%floralkami> @estuko i know, but i guess that wasn't really clear. i meant the language used was pretty advanced as far as picture books go, but the pictures were discovered enough to understand no matter what level of English.
[3:45:20] <%Keyd00d> the anti-woolie game
[3:45:21] <+emperri> zed is that meatball man from power rangers. nobody cares, brits

[3:45:38] <%TheBitingIrish> @emperri LUL
[3:45:40] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ve never understood the z = zed thing
[3:45:45] <%TheBitingIrish> :O
[3:45:45] <Morbidmort> @emperri You're in a Canadian's stream, and in Canada we say Zed
[3:45:50] <%TheBitingIrish> USE IT
[3:45:59] <+Zereaux> @AngriestPat how does it run on ps4?
[3:45:59] <yourliteraldog> So this isn't a fashion disaster future. That Cannibal Lady looks like my local barista.
[3:46:01] <%starotter70> @Decsevm That's pretty apt LUL
[3:46:04] <+emperri> @morbidmort well pat said Z so I guess you're wrong
[3:46:07] <%RubberFistFight> it's "zee". The english invented the language. end of story. :P
[3:46:11] <%floralkami> @estuko did you read a lot to self teach?
[3:46:14] <%Kduff89> no toilet fairies FeelsBadMan
[3:46:33] <CrabSlacks> I'm jealous about how he nailed it
[3:46:34] <Morbidmort> @emperri Pat is the King of being wrong though
[3:46:35] <%starotter70> generation zed?
[3:46:39] <%firehawk_420> I just curb stomped hitler. Wolfenstein is best game.
[3:46:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Every game needs toilet fairies
[3:46:45] <%RubberFistFight> wait, i meant "zed". fml.
[3:46:45] <%Kiiper> zee and Zed refer to the capitalisation of the letters
[3:46:46] <+Estuko> @floralkami yeah, a lot. home was a small place called Bran
[3:46:59] <%starotter70> @RubberFistFight No take backs
[3:47:03] <+Raeiyn> we heard you like cables
[3:47:03] <%Kduff89> cables=shortcuts?
[3:47:08] <%Jolnir> know whats better than toiler fairies?
[3:47:10] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Are there any boss like the giant fire one? I think that was the 2nd one? Cause that made me stop playing the game. So far it all looks to be way better than the 1st.
[3:47:13] <@lewdskeletor13> @rubberfistfight Can’t take it back now Americans are right baby
[3:47:15] <+Raeiyn> they're eventual shortcuts when we have the key item I imagine @Kduff89

[3:49:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember in the surge disabilites are SUPER COMMON cause of how fucked the earth is
[3:49:43] <%firehawk_420> @thebitingirish it’s during the audition scene on Venus, when you’re pretending to be an actor. Hitlers laying on the floor and you can walk up and curb stomp him. It’s a game over but you get an achievement and it’s hilarious.

[3:56:23] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you really should consider a 2-pc setup, you already have the capture hardware and stuff. Part of the reason I switched to using 2 PCs instead of 1 for my stream is exactly that problem - sometimes OBS just don't play nice with games. The upshot is the rare game that consumes all your CPU/GPU juice won't compete with OBS the way Control did.
