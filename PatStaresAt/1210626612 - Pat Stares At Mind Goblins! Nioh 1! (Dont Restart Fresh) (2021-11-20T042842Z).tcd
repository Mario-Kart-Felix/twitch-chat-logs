[0:02:38] <+HellCopter> I had to panic into my inventory and use a full heal for this
[0:02:40] <Darky04> yup, 2 pjases
[0:02:40] <vnzuelandude> i find this phase easier
[0:02:43] <SpookyMooks> gotta kill the little guys maybe?
[0:02:45] <SirMcSlushy> Oh man firebombs came in super handy for this part
[0:02:45] <Darky04> phases*
[0:02:53] <+DatAsuna> the sound went to shit lol
[0:02:54] <%valriot> LUL Phase 2 go up
[0:02:55] <%herecomesmong0> herecomesmong0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey Pat, Mongo here. Totally off topic but I just finished playing all the mainline Yakuza games and was wondering which one was your #1, personally for me it was 2. Keep being awesome.
[0:02:56] <+HellCopter> Odachi is actually great for this
[0:02:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> New Phase!
[0:03:00] <mr_catsup> don't off the torches so they don't spawn
[0:03:02] <SpookyMooks> nooooo
[0:03:03] <+TaurusOxford> F
[0:03:03] <%HotSauceFiend> ALMOST
[0:03:05] <%MooseIsGoose> phase 2
[0:03:06] <theshillman> this is why i always use onmyo for fire damage
[0:03:07] <%RayReborne> yeah that sink move is quick
[0:03:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> getting closer
[0:03:09] <%Broand> phase 2 baybe
[0:03:11] <Profmcstevie> Hell of a boss fight
[0:03:11] <SirMcSlushy> Got uppercutted by the slimes toesies
[0:03:14] <vVAstrAVv> so you know how we keep saying nioh 2 is better. they litterally did this boss but good in 2
[0:03:14] <RushUnplugged> real good attemot
[0:03:15] <amiavamp> was that just its out-of-stamina move? jeez
[0:03:18] <Darky04> so close
[0:03:18] <%MooseIsGoose> He belly bumped you
[0:03:19] <%valriot> bump go up
[0:03:19] <%greasypete00> this boss is stinky
[0:03:21] <oda_flobunaga> Almost, sooooo close
[0:03:23] <%RayReborne> he squish, RUN (again)
[0:03:23] <+rafaelba93> this is the only boss a rember, wonder why
[0:03:25] <+tempestzephyr> booty bump
[0:03:26] <+secretspud> Fuck Umi-bozy, all my homies hate Umi-Bozu
[0:03:26] <SirMcSlushy> You got any other sources of Fire?
[0:03:26] <PwnyB> That was genuine anger. lol
[0:03:28] <+DatAsuna> omnyo fire shot deletes phase 1, hyokotto mask deletes phase 2
[0:03:29] <fmbboaventura> I think staying close to him in the first phase is safer.
[0:03:33] <slipdog> Easily
[0:03:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> tiny baby fists
[0:03:38] <%HotSauceFiend> he did beat it
[0:03:39] <+DatAsuna> No, but he beat this
[0:03:39] <fcKurl> I think he beat it
[0:03:40] <amiavamp> He beat this stage at least
[0:03:42] <%HotSauceFiend> i think
[0:03:43] <%RayReborne> he nearly did if not did i think
[0:03:43] <@Lion_kun> Save your spirit animal for that second phase.
[0:03:43] <%MugenSandan> pretty sure he beat it
[0:03:43] <%valriot> BTW, this is the worst level and boss in the entire series, so you are getting over the hurdle
[0:03:44] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you have been out orbed sir
[0:03:44] <+DatAsuna> Woolie used onmyo
[0:03:46] <%Axellogic> Alot of people get stuck here
[0:03:46] <superdude22> HUG HIIIIIIIIIIIIM
[0:03:46] <%Broand> woolie specifically said this motherfucker sucks ass
[0:03:47] <amiavamp> This is the stage he complained about on the podcast
[0:03:48] <SirMcSlushy> This guy is a bit of a pain
[0:03:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> hes past this for sure
[0:03:51] <%tanarath> Don't use the bonfires in the boss area
[0:03:52] <@Lion_kun> Umibozu is universally reviled.
[0:03:52] <Profmcstevie> He did at least bop the slime
[0:03:52] <slipdog> He steamrolled it Pat
[0:03:53] <+Kaiserzelcor> I beat this boss and felt NOTHING
[0:03:56] <mr_catsup> This is the worst 2 missions in the game right?
[0:03:57] <SpookyMooks> you look like you got that first phase down
[0:03:57] <PwnyB> Did Woolie actually stream this?
[0:03:58] <vnzuelandude> this is the hardest boss
[0:03:58] <+Xeogred> there's no bosses like this in 2 really
[0:03:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt he complained about this on the podcast years ago
[0:04:01] <mr_catsup> back to back
[0:04:02] <+DatAsuna> everyone hates umi bozu
[0:04:09] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt he talked to you about this level actually
[0:04:11] <mr_catsup> the centipede and umibozu
[0:04:13] <+KiwiRedgrave> im surprised so many people had such a hard time with this guy. MY hurdle was definitely the bat lady
[0:04:16] <+Xeogred> def one of the worst bosses
[0:04:17] <Profmcstevie> Welcome to the fold pat, Umi hating club
[0:04:17] <+somnomania> this boss is my final form
[0:04:24] <GarbageNirvana> Just think of this like the FFXIV Leviathan fight
[0:04:25] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> hated it at first, but the slippery little fella has grown on me
[0:04:27] <%greasypete00> I remember not having a whole lot of trouble on this guy but I can't remember ehy
[0:04:29] <+DatAsuna> Yeah nioh 2 just has a ton of mediocre bosses and then half the nioh 1 bosses reused. lol
[0:04:31] <Boya1995> this is generally considered the low point of the game
[0:04:33] <+HellCopter> I can't think of any boss as annoying as this guy in the 2 games
[0:04:35] <%XzileGaming> hes VA'd by Ray Barrone
[0:04:35] <+Savarro> This dude is the Ramuh extreme of Nioh
[0:04:36] <%HotSauceFiend> this is Nioh's wall. Either beat this and enjoy the rest of the game or don't and call this game a nightmare
[0:04:36] <%valriot> Nioh 2 even has a semi-redux of this boss in the first DLC, except its actually good LUL
[0:04:51] <+athuramn> use the fire?
[0:05:02] <+DatAsuna> I wouldn't say good so much as medicore, which is better than this
[0:05:03] <amiavamp> @HellCopter The living house thing in Nioh 2 is pretty bad
[0:05:05] <+AWanderingKenku> This is why I recommend people just start with Nioh 2
[0:05:08] <%shruke> !uptime
[0:05:08] <%RayReborne> yeah Fire
[0:05:08] <@Moobot> @shruke I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5m 23s.
[0:05:11] <Profmcstevie> Focus that shit up, it's gaming time
[0:05:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Once you know to use fire and you know how to avoid the insta kill he's not that bad
[0:05:16] <fmbboaventura> I got stuck on the bat lady and that nue son of a bitch. He's still my most hated boss
[0:05:20] <+Jack8274> You HAVE to use the bonfires around the arena to buff your weapon with fire to do damage
[0:05:24] <+HellCopter> @amiavamp Yeah but it's a much better version of the Nioh 1 boss lol
[0:05:24] <+DatAsuna> Know what does good damage? fire shot spell
[0:05:29] <SpookyMooks> ok night all, good luck pat <3
[0:05:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @athuramn problem with using the fire is adds in the 2nd phase spawn
[0:05:35] <vVAstrAVv> the fire IS the damage pat
[0:05:44] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> is he out of amulets? cant see his inventory
[0:05:45] <@Lion_kun> Is he out of fire paper?
[0:05:45] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:05:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I didn't get stuck thin the nobu-hime fight
[0:05:49] <+DatAsuna> vampire and nue are ez
[0:05:49] <oda_flobunaga> @amiavamp its an improvement over Orochi from this though
[0:05:53] <mr_catsup> you can learn a magic that summons the doggo to shred it
[0:05:54] <SirMcSlushy> Got boated
[0:05:57] <%RayReborne> so Pat forgot Fire lol
[0:06:02] <SirMcSlushy> DEPORTED
[0:06:08] <+TaurusOxford> Boss Rage: Pat Edition
[0:06:08] <%Axellogic> I always keep Elixer on both hotbars in the same spot
[0:06:09] <Visorak6> This boss is absolutely a wall for certain people
[0:06:11] <mr_saturday93> honestly fuck this boss and this stave
[0:06:14] <%valriot> YEYEYEYE
[0:06:14] <+Jack8274> @PatStaresAt The bonfires around the arena buff your weapon with fire and you do more damage
[0:06:16] <+KiwiRedgrave> umi bozoed
[0:06:17] <+DatAsuna> fire shot is better than fire talisman
[0:06:17] <slipdog> yeah them jawns bussin
[0:06:17] <mr_catsup> bottom!!!
[0:06:17] <+tempestzephyr> you can do it
[0:06:19] <%valriot> Magic go up
[0:06:21] <+HellCopter> Magic time \o/
[0:06:22] <mr_catsup> aaaaa
[0:06:24] <%HotSauceFiend> pat dont forget to use titile points
[0:06:24] <theshillman> @RayReborne i think he's saving it so he doesnt have to deal with adds
[0:06:24] <mr_catsup> welp
[0:06:26] <%Broand> you want a dumb cheesy strat?
[0:06:26] <Killhooligan> this ng+?
[0:06:33] <+DatAsuna> with fire shot you wouldn't have to wait and put yourself in danger
[0:06:37] <Profmcstevie> Oh yeah, now we have MOTIVATION
[0:06:40] <+HellCopter> I leaned on magic to platinum both games, it's so freakin useful
[0:06:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Killhooligan no.
[0:06:42] <%Axellogic> @Jack8274 he knows he just learned it lets the adds spawn in phase 2
[0:06:43] <theshillman> yeyeyeyeye
[0:06:45] <PwnyB> @Jack8274 He knows, but I think he wants to save b/c adds, which is very reasonable.
[0:06:46] <KeiPrime> no this is just new game
[0:06:46] <theshillman> he's learning
[0:06:50] <%RayReborne> now set to item shortcut
[0:06:50] <KeiPrime> lol
[0:06:52] <fmbboaventura> Did pat get the sloth talisman? Sloth and quick change are lifesavers

[0:07:45] <+KiwiRedgrave> the mine with the big skull centipede?

[0:14:08] <+rafaelba93> congrats, you beat the game basically
[0:14:08] <+pieking83> Hyottoko Mask

[0:14:09] <%Axellogic> consumabls
[0:14:10] <+DatAsuna> hyokotto mask, it's a flamethrower
[0:14:11] <slipdog> Hyottori mask or whatever
[0:14:12] <%superc37> @lion_kun why would he call a good game shit tho
[0:14:12] <fmbboaventura> Sloth can cheese most bosses. It's in the omnio tree
[0:14:15] <mr_catsup> MASK consumable
[0:14:17] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Hyotto mask in your inventory. It's a useable
[0:14:17] <%Broand> its a consumable
[0:14:17] <+zanz_san> hyoto masks
[0:14:17] <SirMcSlushy> You have some I think
[0:14:19] <+DatAsuna> it deletes his health bar
[0:14:20] <amiavamp> Consumable
[0:14:20] <shiny_prinny> consumable item

[0:14:27] <+DatAsuna> it's a flamethrower
[0:14:27] <amiavamp> Spits fire literally

[0:14:32] <wrydiculous> breathe fire
[0:14:35] <+Local16> Flamethrower
[0:14:35] <vnzuelandude> its as mask that makes you breathe fire
[0:14:35] <%probablypoisonous> psaWink
[0:14:36] <%tanarath> deletes his health bar?
[0:14:38] <PwnyB> Use one for fun. They're fucking everywhere.
[0:14:46] <+HellCopter> Give yourself a pat on the back
[0:14:47] <+DatAsuna> there's also projectile spells
[0:14:50] <meridian7890> @fmbboaventura how to unlock sloth 🤔
[0:14:51] <+zanz_san> you can try items for free in the training dojo
[0:14:52] <%MooseIsGoose> Good job
[0:14:52] <Profmcstevie> Still, fucking gaming dude
[0:14:53] <Killhooligan> is the audio of the stage supposed to sound like a wind tunnel?
[0:14:55] <+DatAsuna> just a straight up fireball spell
[0:14:57] <%Bt_Robot> Excellent work
[0:15:06] <mr_catsup> also doggo is crazy good cause inherent fire
[0:15:11] <SirMcSlushy> Political bs yeh
[0:15:15] <%MooseIsGoose> yup
[0:15:16] <shiny_prinny> yeah pretty much
[0:15:16] <saddest_man> orb defeated
[0:15:16] <%transporterthesequel> YES, it is.
[0:15:17] <slipdog> yeah its ResidentSleeper
[0:15:19] <+HellCopter> Yes its warring states but with monsters
[0:15:19] <%Piemono> Its just japanese history
[0:15:19] <%MugenSandan> yup you got it
[0:15:20] <%valriot> Its just Nobunagas Ambition
[0:15:21] <@Lion_kun> Japan loves the Sengoku period.
[0:15:21] <amiavamp> Warring States Bullshit Again, that's a good title
[0:15:22] <%greasypete00> yeah
[0:15:22] <Visorak6> Its pretty bland outside of the BBEG
[0:15:22] <+rafaelba93> you beat the game
[0:15:23] <+DatAsuna> Yup and nioh 2 is that but without even william
[0:15:23] <%transporterthesequel> It is literally exactly that
[0:15:24] <$ArcanumArcanum> Nioh's story is ass
[0:15:24] <%probablypoisonous> probablypoisonous converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:15:24] <brominefromspace> yea you need a reson to fight oda nobunaga
[0:15:24] <+zanz_san> Kobayakawa is responsible for Ieyasu winning
[0:15:25] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's post-Warring States, etechnically
[0:15:26] <theshillman> it really is
[0:15:26] <TheyCallMeVawn> And its fucking great
[0:15:26] <oda_flobunaga> Literally battle of Sekigahara
[0:15:27] <MidnightPacif1c> OOPS ALL NOBUNAGA
[0:15:27] <wrydiculous> it is
[0:15:27] <%cvp5127> even william doesnt care
[0:15:28] <+polothegreatest> DIO?
[0:15:29] <+tempestzephyr> story doesn't make sense
[0:15:29] <+DatAsuna> You'll HATE nioh 2's story
[0:15:30] <%MisterRockett> It's really funny how little the monsters seem to matter.
[0:15:30] <+MisdirectionErection> Yeah that Japans for you
[0:15:33] <%JoshManVGH> But also something something Irish Ghost
[0:15:34] <youngking_kush> It's literally just Japanese history with Demons
[0:15:36] <+Local16> Yup and it's based around William's life just altered a bit
[0:15:37] <+HellCopter> It expects you to know these people
[0:15:37] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Nioh 2 is hanging out with Oda Nobunaga
[0:15:38] <%MooseIsGoose> 2 is only a little better here
[0:15:38] <mr_catsup> I think the characters are cool
[0:15:39] <%Axellogic> Any of the interesting parts of the story happen offscreen
[0:15:41] <wrydiculous> except they throw Yokai in
[0:15:43] <fmbboaventura> @meridian7890 It's a skill you unlock in the omnio tree. A talisman. Kinda like the weakness talisman. Makes enemies move in slowmo
[0:15:43] <Profmcstevie> It's a people story in a world of monsters ResidentSleeper
[0:15:44] <primaryfire> mostly based on real historical conflicts and spiced up with spirit stones
[0:15:45] <fuji_n2> I mean that's every Japan oriented story game
[0:15:47] <%MooseIsGoose> both still stink
[0:15:47] <brominefromspace> because samurai are badass
[0:15:50] <%greasypete00> it's also not modified enough to not be boring political shit
[0:15:51] <mr_catsup> the payoff is really nice
[0:15:51] <Memitim> 2 is slightly better imo
[0:15:52] <+SWFanatic> What if the warring states was in high school?
[0:15:53] <%RayReborne> IT IS, A LITTLE
[0:15:54] <mr_catsup> NOO
[0:15:54] <+athuramn> 2 is way better
[0:15:55] <youngking_kush> It is
[0:15:56] <mr_catsup> LIES
[0:15:57] <@QueequegTheater> It is
[0:15:58] <@Lion_kun> Nioh 2 is funny because it's set in the past and has some hilarious bullshit like how you are actually Hidejoyshi.
[0:15:59] <ExpressNode> He sounds like Haku from Uta
[0:16:00] <%transporterthesequel> Cause superior nippon steel has always dealt with monsters
[0:16:01] <mr_catsup> FOR 2 MISSIONS
[0:16:04] <+athuramn> in comparison to this shit?
[0:16:04] <+DatAsuna> It's just you doing warring states shit and then nobunaga says you're ambitious
[0:16:04] <%valriot> Nioh 2 is a lot more fun, you get to see Yoshitsune
[0:16:07] <fuji_n2> it is a little better
[0:16:08] <amiavamp> This is a Magic Realism setting, superstition and reality aren't considered "separate" in these kinds of views
[0:16:09] <@Lion_kun> Hideyoshi*
[0:16:09] <+ScrapKingKeita> OH GOD, THAT VOICE ACTOR IS KEIJI FUJIWARA ;-;
[0:16:09] <%MugenSandan> Because if you have a name in Nioh 1 you also have super powers
[0:16:11] <+zanz_san> yes?
[0:16:11] <%superc37> no one said nioh had a good story lol
[0:16:12] <TWOxACROSS> Well, in Nioh 2 there's a whole scene about discovering your parentage and it's handled with no emotion
[0:16:14] <%JoshManVGH> Cause we need to have inexplicable feudal lords who can summon spirits, cause why not.
[0:16:15] <%probablypoisonous> GF says congrats on the boss we cheered
[0:16:15] <+DatAsuna> Because 2 is even worse
[0:16:16] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt I unironically really like Nioh 2's story a lot
[0:16:17] <slipdog> they did the walking dead thing with the monsters but like, thats the most interesting part of this setting
[0:16:19] <%greasypete00> it's like if Yakuza was boring
[0:16:22] <%hax_metatron> LUL imagine preferring the storytelling of Nioh over Dark Souls. That’s clearly not their thing
[0:16:22] <exas45> my garbage is BETTER
[0:16:22] <+tempestzephyr> they're  not good
[0:16:23] <meridian7890> @fmbboaventura oh ok so i have to get it using skill tree thanks
[0:16:24] <mr_catsup> 1 is better
[0:16:24] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 1 is a bad story with 2-3 cool things
[0:16:26] <+HellCopter> Nioh 2's story is more emotional but told kinda worse
[0:16:26] <TheyCallMeVawn> Hey I like the stories
[0:16:26] <fuji_n2> nah nioh 2 is better, just not by a lot
[0:16:27] <oda_flobunaga> eeeeh
[0:16:27] <sennoh> 2 at least has fun characters, 1 doesn't
[0:16:27] <mr_catsup> 2 is cope
[0:16:28] <Profmcstevie> King of the trash plots
[0:16:28] <%Jasek7> this shit smells worse
[0:16:30] <+BoboDaHobo> I'd retain more of the story if the dialogue wasnt translated.
[0:16:30] <+ScrapKingKeita> This must have been recorded just before his cancer got really bad...
[0:16:30] <%Axellogic> Cause they both suck but one was partially written by Akira Kurosawa
[0:16:30] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 is a bad story with no cool things
[0:16:31] <%valriot> Nioh 2 is more fun with its characters
[0:16:32] <PwnyB> There actually pretty good stories that are told poorly in their medium.
[0:16:34] <@Lion_kun> Nioh 2 is about being a cool demon guy and discovering your demon family roots.
[0:16:37] <primaryfire> I like the stories because of the historical aspect
[0:16:38] <mr_catsup> no it's not Luk
[0:16:39] <%transporterthesequel> THE EVIL IRISH
[0:16:40] <%SharkMissile> Is that guy evil
[0:16:40] <+polothegreatest> V
[0:16:40] <amiavamp> Neither story is good but at least the British stuff is cool
[0:16:43] <%RayReborne> HE STOLE OUR IRISH WAIFU FAIRY
[0:16:44] <vVAstrAVv> because nioh 2s story just assumes you know Japanese history
[0:16:46] <SirMcSlushy> Why this man look so fuckin' evil.
[0:16:48] <valerios_> a perfectly normal british man
[0:16:48] <scrumbotime> EVIL White Man must be defeated by GOOD White Man
[0:16:49] <mr_catsup> 1 has way more pathos
[0:16:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 2's story is even worse than this, it's not just boring
[0:16:50] <+Mrbaconator> you can tell he is british by the cursed shit
[0:16:50] <youngking_kush> Nioh 2 story is good if you liked like, Onimusha & Dynasty Warriors back in the day
[0:16:51] <@QueequegTheater> Sekiro's awful story is a fucking triumph compared to these games
[0:16:52] <%SaiyanShoto> The British aren't real
[0:16:54] <%herecomesmong0> the most evil looking man alive lets trust him
[0:16:54] <oda_flobunaga> Water bottle
[0:16:55] <%MugenSandan> DA FOREIGNERS
[0:16:55] <%toolofparanoia> BRI'ISH!
[0:16:56] <+Savarro> Idk 2 has a moment that got a huge popoff from me near the end, but only if you've played the first game
[0:16:56] <+zanz_san> Nioh 1 is the Shogun tv show
[0:16:58] <%Axellogic> MY FISH WIFE
[0:16:59] <slipdog> put some fucking socks on
[0:16:59] <Lunalios> What's V from DMC V doing here?
[0:17:03] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh hanzo, okatsu and nobunaga are all better in 1 than anyone in 2 lmao
[0:17:03] <%Axellogic> WHERES MY FISH WIFE!?
[0:17:06] <mr_catsup> cause the protag has actual urgency
[0:17:06] <%probablypoisonous> BUT NOT THE BRITISH CHILDREN
[0:17:09] <Memitim> Tbh it might be the same only I forgive 2 more because it's my OC instead of William
[0:17:10] <+BoboDaHobo> This is an action game that doesn't need a story, every cutscene is a waste of time
[0:17:11] <%Broand> He stole your irish waifu
[0:17:13] <@QueequegTheater> LOOK OUT HE'S GONNA TAKE YOUR TEETH
[0:17:17] <fmbboaventura> @meridian7890 check out quick change in the ninjustsu tree as well. Also carnage and steel talismans in omnyo tree
[0:17:17] <theshillman> average englishman
[0:17:18] <+DatAsuna> Nobunaga is cooler in 1 scene of nioh 1 than the whole of nioh 2
[0:17:19] <%toolofparanoia> FISH MONGER GO HOME
[0:17:22] <fuji_n2> that's nioh man's fish wife
[0:17:26] <+tempestzephyr> british scalies
[0:17:26] <+rafaelba93> british magic
[0:17:27] <%Jasek7> next will be the bobbywaffles
[0:17:29] <SpookyMooks> Can confirm we all have our own fish wife over here
[0:17:30] <wrydiculous> I still laugh at Kelley's plan to ressurect Nobunaga till this day.
[0:17:30] <Visorak6> MY NINJA WAY
[0:17:37] <%valriot> Nioh 1 has some good pulls, but 2 has some really cool yokai shit, and Minamoto-Yoshitsune, the GUY
[0:17:43] <SirMcSlushy> LUCK
[0:17:45] <mr_catsup> and not a silent clown such that the story has to focus on the B plot fot 90% of it
[0:17:52] <%zeroarturia> oh my God that was Kimura's voice actor!!
[0:17:53] <+DatAsuna> @wrydiculous That scene alone is better than the whole of nioh 2
[0:17:53] <meridian7890> @fmbboaventura ok ill try to remember all 4 skills
[0:17:58] <@Lion_kun> 1's best thing was Date Masamune and he was dlc.
[0:18:01] <%RayReborne> bigger number better streamer Kappa
[0:18:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You want to fight revenants for better equipmet
[0:18:09] <%MooseIsGoose> now your doing it
[0:18:14] <+GojiraKira> biggest dickus
[0:18:14] <%transporterthesequel> YES PAT IS GETTING IT
[0:18:15] <meridian7890> @fmbboaventura any tips for kusarigama thats my main
[0:18:15] <%toolofparanoia> GAIJIN GO HOME
[0:18:18] <wrydiculous> Pretty much
[0:18:19] <TheyCallMeVawn> Date and Yukimura were sick in Nioh 1
[0:18:20] <%transporterthesequel> BIG NUMBER MAKE STRONG
[0:18:20] <@Lion_kun> Though oda going bitch please to kelley was pretty funny.
[0:18:21] <Lunalios> NUMB BURR
[0:18:21] <Profmcstevie> Bigger number till you need specific resistances IF that
[0:18:24] <mr_catsup> INTELLEGENT GAMING
[0:18:24] <fmbboaventura> Dlc in this game was really good
[0:18:25] <youngking_kush> Make sure you're not too fat
[0:18:27] <%Jasek7> number go up
[0:18:30] <oda_flobunaga> @valriot + Yorimitsu = Vergil+ Artorius
[0:18:32] <%RayReborne> bigger RESISTANCE
[0:18:35] <Visorak6> accessories are not as simple as bigger number sadly
[0:18:39] <saddest_man> NUMBERS GO UP
[0:18:42] <sennoh> @DatAsuna Hard disagree on that one, Nobunaga is like a 10 second cameo, and Okatsu is just kinda there
[0:18:51] <SirMcSlushy> Honestly unless ya wanna focus on a specific effect, 'BIGGER NUMBER' will get ya through the game fine.
[0:18:58] <+pieking83> you should dismantle it
[0:19:00] <shiny_prinny> yep
[0:19:00] <Profmcstevie> Shrine, DUMP THAT SHIT
[0:19:00] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yup
[0:19:01] <+MooseIsGoose> Do that at the blacksmith for materials
[0:19:01] <fmbboaventura> @meridian7890 nah, I'm an odachi main. Sword as secondary
[0:19:01] <slipdog> you can also deconstruct it for mats
[0:19:02] <%Broand> Or hold onto a kusarigama to see how it i-
[0:19:05] <fuji_n2> rigt
[0:19:06] <%JoshManVGH> You got it
[0:19:11] <%Axellogic> better to throw in the blacksmith but its fine I guess
[0:19:13] <+zanz_san> go to dojo and training ground if you want to test stuff out
[0:19:13] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh And nioh 2 doesn't even have that. A single scene character and he's more memorable than literally anything in 2
[0:19:17] <Profmcstevie> The trash master
[0:19:18] <slipdog> for a crafting system that is mostly useless for a good hundred hours
[0:19:20] <meridian7890> Alright thanks anyways 😁
[0:19:23] <%HotSauceFiend> have you been reedeming the title points pat?
[0:19:24] <%Axellogic> the dojo unlocks more skills
[0:19:26] <%RayReborne> or, dissasemble at Blacksmith to try and forge weapons with better buffs and a higher level. either or
[0:19:31] <+rafaelba93> speed it up as much as possible
[0:19:32] <+ahmz1404> how's the nioh mind goblins going today
[0:19:37] <+DatAsuna> Sakon Shima's also cooler than anybody in 2 as well lol
[0:19:38] <%Axellogic> Dojo missions are short btw
[0:19:42] <%HotSauceFiend> You have basically cleared the worst of Nioh
[0:19:43] <%Axellogic> YEs
[0:19:45] <%valriot> Yes
[0:19:47] <mr_catsup> YES
[0:19:48] <amiavamp> Yes, there are much better missions ahead
[0:19:48] <klx5> yes
[0:19:48] <+HellCopter> Absolutely
[0:19:48] <+DatAsuna> Hideyoshi just using a basic katanna was massively disappointing
[0:19:50] <%zeroarturia> yes
[0:19:50] <+Xeogred> Yeah
[0:19:50] <fmbboaventura> Pretty much, I'd say
[0:19:51] <xiccy> NO
[0:19:51] <vVAstrAVv> no
[0:19:51] <fuji_n2> yes
[0:19:51] <vnzuelandude> Yes
[0:19:52] <%SaiyanShoto> yeah
[0:19:53] <%HotSauceFiend> pretty much
[0:19:53] <+zanz_san> you did really good
[0:19:54] <+DatAsuna> Especially with the split staff there
[0:19:54] <primaryfire> 📈
[0:19:54] <slipdog> Yes! theres some really hard stuff ahead but its good hard stuff
[0:19:54] <vVAstrAVv> oh yes
[0:19:55] <oda_flobunaga> It's all downhill from here
[0:19:55] <mr_saturday93> ehhhh
[0:19:55] <%MooseIsGoose> no idea I stopped here
[0:19:55] <+AWanderingKenku> Absolutely
[0:19:55] <SirMcSlushy> My memory is crap, but i'd say so
[0:19:56] <gslayer14> yeah
[0:19:57] <wrydiculous> mmmmm probably
[0:19:57] <+SWFanatic> I was born in the shit, molded by it
[0:19:57] <+ahmz1404> yes
[0:19:58] <shiny_prinny> yeah, the water and poison levels were the worst parts
[0:19:59] <mr_catsup> except 1 boss in DLC
[0:19:59] <%Broand> The next boss was hard but also way better
[0:19:59] <+bellicoseweeb> No, because fire level
[0:19:59] <+athuramn> eh...
[0:19:59] <%RayReborne> i cant answer that i stopped after beating that boss lol
[0:20:01] <SirMcSlushy> The start is rough
[0:20:01] <+pieking83> the worst part but not the hardest
[0:20:02] <+DatAsuna> No, but it's never this bad again
[0:20:02] <sirrice77> relatively smooth
[0:20:03] <%greasypete00> yeah it gets cooler from here
[0:20:03] <fmbboaventura> I wouldn't call it smooth, tho
[0:20:04] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> hahaha theres literally a level that starts in a sewer, but yea :D
[0:20:04] <%Jasek7> idk there is a really shitty but beautiful level later
[0:20:05] <%Axellogic> Theres a difficulty spike later but its mostly fine
[0:20:05] <vVAstrAVv> depends
[0:20:06] <%Nordguy> youll get stuck big time on spiders i think
[0:20:07] <+BoboDaHobo> yes but there are other bad bosses
[0:20:07] <Boya1995> not entierly, but this is the worst of it
[0:20:07] <%superc37> pretty much
[0:20:07] <Profmcstevie> Maybe not smooth but never bad
[0:20:08] <+Local16> Pretty much. One other boss has some jank funk to it
[0:20:08] <%JoshManVGH> Never made it this far, good luck
[0:20:10] <sennoh> @DatAsuna the main character's partner in 2 has more personality than anyone in both games though
[0:20:10] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh god he's making out with the mic
[0:20:11] <%Monkeyweed21> relatively speaking
[0:20:11] <mr_catsup> that's total bullshit but you'll ge ttehre
[0:20:11] <+zanz_san> I saw noel Danchou do worse
[0:20:13] <%toolofparanoia> MIND GOBLINS DEFEATED
[0:20:13] <+DatAsuna> the goblins will continue
[0:20:15] <%hax_metatron> UH……
[0:20:16] <%HotSauceFiend> there is a hiccup in which there is a side mission to defeat umi bozu again
[0:20:17] <+rafaelba93> you can go to 2 now
[0:20:17] <theshillman> no, but it's going to be better
[0:20:18] <+ScrapKingKeita> I think level design is better
[0:20:19] <RushUnplugged> goblins are a different thing, but that's FACTUALLY the worst area
[0:20:20] <%superc37> aside fromt the token poison area
[0:20:20] <%hax_metatron> Sure Kappa
[0:20:23] <+athuramn> if you wanted smooth sailing, it's nioh 2
[0:20:24] <fmbboaventura> The bullshit is the issue
[0:20:24] <xiccy> No
[0:20:25] <+ahmz1404> level designs get really nice after the cave
[0:20:26] <+SilverDevilfish> The mines are peak shit
[0:20:26] <SirMcSlushy> You gonna try the kusarigama?
[0:20:28] <%greasypete00> the bullshit is the issue
[0:20:30] <fuji_n2> have we?
[0:20:31] <xiccy> It get's shittier
[0:20:33] <mr_catsup> ye only 2 bosses are bullshit
[0:20:33] <+Savarro> Yes you've beaten the most bullshit parts
[0:20:33] <+pieking83> its less bullshit for the most part
[0:20:33] <oda_flobunaga> like ff 15
[0:20:34] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh Hide fuckin' sucks so again, hard disagree
[0:20:34] <@Lion_kun> What is the hardest game for you?
[0:20:38] <meridian7890> That is so true this game has some insane bullshit
[0:20:40] <Profmcstevie> He'll game through it
[0:20:41] <mr_catsup> but they are optional
[0:20:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dude, take a break, maybe stop for the night.
[0:20:46] <%HotSauceFiend> Pat is that a heart attack
[0:20:47] <%transporterthesequel> There are two ballchecks, but if you got paste Tengu you're fine.
[0:20:47] <%RayReborne> Yeah the arm shoots suck
[0:20:49] <$ArcanumArcanum> it's fiiiiiine
[0:20:50] <+DatAsuna> Hide is like the go-to example of bad silent protags
[0:20:50] <+SWFanatic> Breathing is good for you
[0:20:50] <%toolofparanoia> It'll feel good later... maybe
[0:20:51] <+UltraViolet371> the actual most important improvement in 2 for me is that the game is fair
[0:20:51] <scrumbotime> Pat Dies Tonight
[0:20:52] <%transporterthesequel> *past
[0:20:52] <cuckholdberry_finn> youre dying

[0:20:56] <NemokillerV> goblin radiation
[0:20:57] <%Bt_Robot> This is mostly about every system in the game and how obtuse they are, right?
[0:20:58] <superdude22> is this a heart attack?
[0:20:58] <placeholder03> Thats a heart attack
[0:20:59] <+SWFanatic> DOOOOOOOM

[0:21:15] <%justcallmebobplease> That's the feeling of expelling some goblin juice
[0:21:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now you're just deliberately describing a heart attack LUL
[0:21:17] <%toolofparanoia> PatStokesAt
[0:21:17] <%greasypete00> or at least leave the game
[0:21:20] <Nymstryx> maybe take a break then?
[0:21:21] <mr_catsup> that sounds real bad
[0:21:21] <%rekinom> you described the symptoms of a heart attach, Pat
[0:21:23] <sennoh> @DatAsuna then we just disagree, nothing more to say LUL
[0:21:26] <the_420_dachshund> might be about to cum
[0:21:26] <%shruke> video games wreck havoc on the body

[0:21:36] <%Broand> I always have a sense of impending doom
[0:21:37] <Profmcstevie> Relax with your fiance and pets dude, bring yourself back down
[0:21:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's also terrifying, because I always have that sense lately
[0:21:39] <+rafaelba93> please dont have a heart attack
[0:21:39] <+ahmz1404> my dad had a heart attack last month, scary as shit

[0:21:54] <%Paperware> Sheer Heart Attack
[0:21:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> What are we talking about
[0:21:56] <+AWanderingKenku> I get that feeling when I jerk off
[0:21:59] <%herecomesmong0> !HEART ATTACKED!
[0:22:01] <%JoshManVGH> Your body has inherent danger sense to "shits about to shut down"
[0:22:04] <JetpackMcQuack> felt like a heart stopped working
[0:22:07] <+tempestzephyr> DOn't die on Stream Pat
[0:22:08] <%toolofparanoia> Death's hand just touched your shoulder
[0:22:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did Pat almost have a heart attack?
[0:22:13] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh Well, do you agree with the people saying skip 2? Because I don't say skip 2, I say play both.
[0:22:15] <%SirGO0SE> @AWanderingKenku especially after monkaS
[0:22:16] <+rafaelba93> hearts are violent organs
[0:22:18] <Gelphaze> where talking about DEATH!
[0:22:18] <@Lion_kun> Turns out he had to take a big shit.
[0:22:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Turns out it was just you actually had a heart. Who knew
[0:22:25] <%Jasek7> was that when you found a single beatle in your apartment?
[0:22:26] <+dante_must_die_exe> yeyeye
[0:22:28] <PwnyB> @tempestzephyr But how will he monetize?
[0:22:29] <cs0402196> Anxiety!
[0:22:30] <Profmcstevie> "symptoms of bitch"
[0:22:33] <brominefromspace> you had scared
[0:22:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean your body is suddenly realizing that your heart isn't working the way it wants to
[0:22:38] <%toolofparanoia> Yeah
[0:22:38] <SirMcSlushy> Panic Attacks SUCK
[0:22:39] <fcKurl> Panic attack yup
[0:22:40] <cuckholdberry_finn> You were a coward. simple as that
[0:22:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Anxiety
[0:22:42] <amiavamp> I had one of those and had a nice 10k bill out of pocket for it yayyyyy
[0:22:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Panic Attack easily
[0:22:46] <JetpackMcQuack> aw jeez
[0:22:47] <+Kaiserzelcor> Yeah I've had multiple panic attacks this year about my health
[0:22:49] <@Lion_kun> What scared you?
[0:22:49] <ShortAssRibs> I AM NOT PANICKING FOOL!
[0:22:52] <SpookyMooks> that sounds fun
[0:22:52] <RushUnplugged> panic attack is SO close to a heart attack
[0:22:52] <+Kaiserzelcor> It's fucking bullshit
[0:22:52] <%Bt_Robot> Panic attack is VERY similar to heart attack
[0:22:53] <%MelBrooksKA> I had that recently
[0:22:54] <@QueequegTheater> GREAT
[0:22:57] <wrydiculous> lol pat deadass experienced iron man 3
[0:22:58] <scrumbotime> I LOVE that your brain can just, decide to tell you that you're dying even when you aren't. What a horrible meat computer.
[0:22:58] <%angryoptimist> Yeah, they can do that.
[0:22:58] <@QueequegTheater> JUST GREAT
[0:22:59] <%RayReborne> oh yeah those. ive had an Anxiety attack, no pain for me but just AWFUL fucking BULLSHIT
[0:22:59] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Holy shit thats the same thing that happened to me. That's how I learned I had fucked up anxiety issues
[0:23:02] <ChristopherWPoindexter> apriShy SilverThink SilverZoom SilverSuffer
[0:23:03] <+polothegreatest> Is lifting weight a mind goblin? Kappa
[0:23:04] <%MelBrooksKA> IT FUCKING SUCKS
[0:23:05] <+DatAsuna> fear itself
[0:23:11] <%Jasek7> irrational
[0:23:12] <RushUnplugged> anxiety don't need no cause
[0:23:12] <Visorak6> panic attacks dont have a reason necessarily
[0:23:15] <%SirGO0SE> theyre self fulfilling
[0:23:16] <scrumbotime> Heyooo
[0:23:16] <sennoh> @DatAsuna of course not, it's better than 1 as a game from what I've seen, though I only played the first
[0:23:17] <%HotSauceFiend> UTM panic attacks
[0:23:21] <%Bt_Robot> Panic causes panic
[0:23:23] <%AncelDeLambert> a panic or anxiety attack is JUST your body fucking you over
[0:23:23] <cuckholdberry_finn> Anxiety sounds genuinley awful jeeeeeze
[0:23:23] <ExpressNode> Only had one panic attack ever

[0:23:34] <%XzileGaming> panic attacks dont make sense sometimeas
[0:23:35] <%toolofparanoia> they can just happen sometimes
[0:23:35] <+DatAsuna> ui[
[0:23:35] <@Lion_kun> I mean nothing is pretty scary.
[0:23:36] <+Local16> Yup
[0:23:36] <+HellCopter> Bad brain
[0:23:36] <fuji_n2> that's how it goes
[0:23:36] <+dante_must_die_exe> FUCKING NOTHING
[0:23:37] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking NOTHING. Your body just wakes up and says "fuck you, human"

[0:23:44] <+ahmz1404> maybe repression of something
[0:23:46] <+polothegreatest> Thats metal
[0:23:47] <BattlexQueen> Yeah
[0:23:47] <PwnyB> Humans are a fucking wreck. How do people think a perfect being created us?
[0:23:51] <%SirGO0SE> "oh no im having a panic attack" -> causes panic attack
[0:23:52] <cartakus> The nothingness of the universe?
[0:23:52] <+rafaelba93> thats about right, yeah
[0:23:53] <+BoboDaHobo> the panic attack caused itself
[0:23:57] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Dude me too!
[0:23:58] <%AncelDeLambert> I had anxiety attacks this week, FUCK they're annoying.
[0:23:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's how panic attacks work
[0:24:00] <%Jasek7> how'd we get here?
[0:24:00] <%toolofparanoia> seems legit
[0:24:01] <%transporterthesequel> Only panic attack I ever had was a doc coming out and yelling at me about a chart I didn't even fuck up.
[0:24:02] <%HotSauceFiend> oh thats why when things are going too good you feel the impedinging badd stuff
[0:24:03] <JetpackMcQuack> first i was anxious and then i was anxious that i was anxious
[0:24:04] <@Ranryu692> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
[0:24:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> DOOOOOOM
[0:24:04] <RyuuAoi> Maybe Peach spiked your drink or something
[0:24:05] <@Lion_kun> Those happen to me when I'm thinking about my inevitable demise.
[0:24:05] <+ahmz1404> you felt something was wrong in the force
[0:24:08] <+flexin_apex> Sometimes nothing is something
[0:24:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's how it be
[0:24:10] <%Bt_Robot> Sometimes life just says "fuck you"
[0:24:10] <Profmcstevie> Anybody else smell Doom
[0:24:11] <%AncelDeLambert> tiny baby ones, though, so it wasn't as bad as it could be
[0:24:12] <+Savarro> Don't you love it when your brain just goes "yeah but what if tho" for no reason?
[0:24:13] <@Ranryu692> man, Morbo is the best
[0:24:14] <+ahmz1404> maybe you're a jedi
[0:24:20] <+SWFanatic> Thats just how this fuck of a world is sometimes
[0:24:21] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh I meant the people saying to skip 1 and play 2, those people are just silly
[0:24:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did I miss a good stream?
[0:24:22] <+zanz_san> oh god
[0:24:25] <+dante_must_die_exe> i learned about immersion therapy on my OWN because of panic/anxiety attacks LUL
[0:24:25] <slix3431> Wait Pat what DOES cause panic attacks?
[0:24:28] <%SaiyanShoto> She could've been stalking you
[0:24:28] <@QueequegTheater> Maybe she played the long game
[0:24:28] <%greasypete00> that's like 30 years ago
[0:24:28] <SirMcSlushy> Mind Goblin defeated.
[0:24:29] <Shwepie> Sounds like your pessimism told your subconscious brain that things never go this good and bad stuff is bound to happen.
[0:24:29] <oda_flobunaga> Good job
[0:24:30] <TheyCallMeVawn> But maybe she did though

[0:24:41] <%valriot> Yee
[0:24:41] <%JoshManVGH> "Things are going TOO well..." says the brain "Better do something about that!"
[0:24:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did you do it?
[0:24:42] <%SinnerEbru> ddi you find a new goblin??

[0:25:14] <%valriot> Nioh has CONTENT dude
[0:25:14] <+Savarro> Don't worry about 1's dlc
[0:25:14] <%MugenSandan> Nioh is a long ass game

[0:25:44] <%SinnerEbru> hes checking his sponsor list
[0:25:46] <primaryfire> the dlc has fewer missions per region but the difficulty jump between base game and dlc is FUCKED
[0:25:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat is taking Thanksgiving off

[0:26:27] <jevichrono> !uptime
[0:26:27] <@Moobot> @jevichrono I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 42s.
[0:26:30] <+zanz_san> r u guys celebrating turkey day?
[0:26:30] <scrumbotime> Use Paige to artificially reduce your MMR to stomp on noobs
[0:26:30] <$PAPA_BUNGO> Cheer500 also just wanted to say i don't get to see your live streams often but these goblin streams have been my favorite thing in a while. good job pat
[0:26:33] <ChristopherWPoindexter> This may be splitting hairs, but maybe you defeating those mind goblins caused some massive cognitive dissonance, sudden stress/ignited unique combinations in your brain, literally creating the physical symptoms because mentally it felt so weird/new.... I hope that made sense. 🥴
[0:26:38] <%RayReborne> @slix3431 stop i saw that pic and died LUL
[0:26:45] <%HotSauceFiend> ff14?
[0:26:48] <%JoshManVGH> Nice!
[0:26:48] <RyuuAoi> Pat, do a San Andreas quick look
[0:26:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Elden Ring?
[0:26:55] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> did i miss someone bitching about nm heroes?
[0:26:56] <%zeroarturia> Cool no NFTS
[0:26:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> GTA TRilogy?
[0:26:57] <+zanz_san> wut is it?
[0:26:57] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Master Chief Collection coop with Peach, @patstaresat ?
[0:26:58] <slix3431> @RayReborne Halo is a decent Fortnite spinoff
[0:27:02] <ChristopherWPoindexter> SilverThink nagPause
[0:27:02] <%Speed1ines> decrypting the email from the reflection in your eyes
[0:27:04] <jevichrono> Man, Pat is looking extra hobo recently. Nice
[0:27:04] <%Broand> Oh that! you LOVE that!
[0:27:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Playing video games is your job. Fuck...
[0:27:14] <+JustToWatch> good to hear you finally got the bored ape yacht club sponsorship
[0:27:15] <%MechArch> is this how the sausage is made?
[0:27:15] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @slix3431 🤭
[0:27:16] <jorniev> IS HE REALLY TYPING?
[0:27:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat's doing business stuff
[0:27:20] <%JoshManVGH> Do you ever get approached about crypto shit?
[0:27:22] <%valriot> For real though, for people interested in Nioh, play Nioh 2. Treat Nioh 1 as a prequel game you can go back to later, but Nioh 2 is just flat out a way better game in basically everyway, and requires almost no knowledge of Nioh 1
[0:27:32] <RyuuAoi> @jevichrono Whatever, man! He's hot!
[0:27:37] <ChristopherWPoindexter> NODDERS
[0:27:41] <%RayReborne> @slix3431 naw i meant the pic of "why is the enemy who killed me twerking on my corpse?" in Halo infinite
[0:27:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Don't rub it in
[0:27:44] <Profmcstevie> Video games is the medium from which he does his job
[0:27:54] <+DatAsuna> @valriot Again, hard disagree, Nioh 2 bored me to tears as a fan of Nioh 1
[0:27:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> QA is about not having your reports taken seriously
[0:28:00] <%tanarath> @valriot was curious, will skip to 2.
[0:28:01] <jorniev> QA guys are the monst creative gamers out there
[0:28:03] <primaryfire> QA is about rubbing walls
[0:28:03] <%zeroarturia> Speaking of NFTS did anybody catch the massive blowback on the G4tv?
[0:28:06] <%SinnerEbru> yeah its rough for yall
[0:28:07] <%Birdigalore> Bustin' makes me feel good!
[0:28:08] <sennoh> @DatAsuna I would say Skipping 1 is kind of possible if you really don't care about the narrative, since 2 just lifts everything from it functionally
[0:28:08] <slix3431> @RayReborne I did too bro. That's why I made the joke lol
[0:28:11] <%MooseIsGoose> gotta rattle your cans for them coins
[0:28:11] <RyuuAoi> Pat is an influencer

[0:28:16] <%SirGO0SE> you should show a little more titty then imo tbh
[0:28:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> For QA, you ideally need lots of theoretical knowledge about how the engine might work
[0:28:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Corners?
[0:28:20] <%JoshManVGH> If we not entertained Pat got no monies
[0:28:20] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You are essentially a town jester

[0:28:46] <%superc37> @datasuna how the fuck did having a dt and yokai super powers and baller ass new weapon types and moves bore you more than 1
[0:28:48] <+DatAsuna> @sennoh Not really since the bosses it reuses are dropped of their cool context and onmyo is compeltely slashed
[0:28:48] <%Broand> I'll have a mojito
[0:28:48] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt more like a concierge
[0:28:50] <%Monkeyweed21> You're the Digital Age equivalent of a Jester
[0:28:50] <%Speed1ines> @DatAsuna HOW? There's so much less.
[0:28:51] <RyuuAoi> Tips. You make funny jokes. Nip slips. Yeah
[0:28:51] <%cvp5127> more like a clown
[0:28:52] <+BoboDaHobo> I mean I got drunk so yeah
[0:28:52] <+Mrbaconator> i feel like your job is more about playing video games than QA is
[0:28:53] <Lucid_Dynamic> You rely on tips.
[0:28:53] <%SaiyanShoto> So do we make it rain on you?
[0:28:54] <Profmcstevie> soapbox that asks for money
[0:28:58] <%CalderGaming> no because we don't live in frenchland
[0:28:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Swedes?
[0:29:00] <%JoshManVGH> But none of that smelling of booze at the end of the night
[0:29:00] <jorniev> BARTENDING CLOWN
[0:29:01] <jevichrono> That's a juggler
[0:29:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm glad I really started something here LUL
[0:29:04] <romeodejuliette> you are more similar to someone preforming on the street
[0:29:05] <%Birdigalore> Yes all jugglers are indeed Swedish
[0:29:06] <+SWFanatic> Shifty Jugglers
[0:29:09] <+tempestzephyr> shaking that orb around
[0:29:12] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[0:29:12] <%herecomesmong0> Exactly like that
[0:29:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> What did I get into?
[0:29:13] <+ahmz1404> how much performing is there though, seems like you're just being yourself, or are you that good at performing
[0:29:13] <%Bt_Robot> No, is that a French Canada thing?
[0:29:16] <ChristopherWPoindexter> I feel like I would describe streamers/influencers like either fashion models and/or, most likely, radio DJ's to people who are "out of the loop, too old."
[0:29:17] <%valriot> Juggalos
[0:29:19] <+polothegreatest> mmmm
[0:29:20] <mr_catsup> LUL
[0:29:20] <+Kaiserzelcor> Can you do that juggler impression again?
[0:29:23] <%bravebravesrobin> can I get a shot of whisky?
[0:29:25] <+SWFanatic> while someone else picks your pocket?
[0:29:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hype Man
[0:29:30] <%MooseIsGoose> No I donate because you shake that orb
[0:29:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're a hype man
[0:29:32] <%SaiyanShoto> If the juggling is the video games then you are a bad juggler
[0:29:33] <jorniev> PAT IS A JUGGALO GOT IT
[0:29:35] <primaryfire> the guy who snags your watch while he talks to you
[0:29:36] <+Mrbaconator> you have a tiktok
[0:29:40] <+DatAsuna> @valriot A lot of the new shit just isn't good, and what's reused isn't always improved, e.g. stuff like the yasuke fight or the saika fight are just lamer versions of stuff in nioh 1. And again onmyo sucks in 2
[0:29:41] <RyuuAoi> Do they have the juggling monkeys in Canada, Pat?
[0:29:44] <%JoshManVGH> TicTok?
[0:29:44] <+dante_must_die_exe> it's the mind goblin minefield that is the juggling
[0:29:46] <jevichrono> Pat's a Juggalo
[0:29:48] <ChristopherWPoindexter> *describe podcasters, too, not just streamers/influencers, as either fashion
[0:29:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ugh
[0:29:52] <%SinnerEbru> damn you too????
[0:29:52] <+polothegreatest> doodSad
[0:29:53] <ChristopherWPoindexter> oh god
[0:29:53] <%valriot> Just drink Fuego the true Juggalo way
[0:29:54] <%tanarath> And twitch, and zangief, and elmo, and paige.
[0:29:55] <%SirGO0SE> why are you getting crypto emails? LUL
[0:29:56] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[0:29:56] <%MooseIsGoose> You have a tictok
[0:29:58] <+ScrapKingKeita> Has your face been turned into an NFT yet?
[0:29:59] <%Bt_Robot> What we've got over here in my town are dudes with cardoard signs.
[0:29:59] <+ahmz1404> filter crypto to spam
[0:29:59] <%WhereIsWill> make a folder Kappa
[0:30:03] <%JoshManVGH> Fuuuuuck
[0:30:04] <Profmcstevie> Suck these NFTITTIES
[0:30:05] <Visorak6> How many in the last week?
[0:30:05] <+SWFanatic> And sometimes Paige makes you coffee. Its a tough life.
[0:30:05] <+tempestzephyr> orb coin directly to you!
[0:30:05] <%SirGO0SE> ahhh
[0:30:05] <%transporterthesequel> Pat Stares At Crypto
[0:30:06] <Zombrocom> We appreciate it not clogging up the stream like it does your email, for real
[0:30:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Please don't actually start using TikTok. There are way too many of us boomers
[0:30:13] <slix3431> FartingDickwithFartingballs Coin
[0:30:15] <%Nordguy> just filter NFT and Bitcoin
[0:30:16] <%RayReborne> man fucking crypto/nfts christ
[0:30:17] <ChristopherWPoindexter> and how many of them are actually legit...like...oof....
[0:30:19] <scrumbotime> Pat should be on G4 and shill crypto
[0:30:22] <%valriot> Check out our NFT "Business"
[0:30:22] <ExpressNode> Ewww
[0:30:24] <%transporterthesequel> Fuck that Crypto mech game hurts so fucking much
[0:30:25] <%angryoptimist> People wanna move those shitcoins and scam people out of actual money.
[0:30:26] <%JoshManVGH> Cause crypto will infect everything if given a chance...
[0:30:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Murder by death
[0:30:28] <%Monkeyweed21> KAATHE INVESTED HEAVILY INTO DARKCOIN HE NEEDS IT TO TAKE OFF
[0:30:32] <+Savarro> Oh shit you got an email from Kevin Pereira!?
[0:30:35] <ExpressNode> You could just say no the first time right?
[0:30:36] <jevichrono> Did Pat know that someone made an NFT of woolie ?
[0:30:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> You should do it just so you can rip some techbro a new one
[0:30:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I hope crypto bottoms out and all their investors go destitute
[0:30:37] <+SWFanatic> My new NFT is called SCAM COIN
[0:30:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> spam is definitely not okay
[0:30:43] <%MechArch> what does that even mean?
[0:30:44] <romeodejuliette> pat are you making NFT's? Kappa
[0:30:44] <Profmcstevie> The hard "FUCK OFF" does wonders
[0:30:46] <primaryfire> did you hear phil spencer say that nft stuff seems more about exploitation than entertainment
[0:30:48] <RyuuAoi> Invite them on and just talk shit yo them. That'd be good content.
[0:30:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Well, thanks for that
[0:30:48] <+Mrbaconator> kaathe would absolutely be into crypto shit
[0:30:48] <%AncelDeLambert> can you program NFT directly to your spam folder?
[0:30:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> dunk on his dumb video game live on air
[0:30:51] <+Kaiserzelcor> Pat did you see the G4 NFT freakout that Kevin did?
[0:30:55] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 The devil trigger has 1 stance with barely any move variety and is far less interesting than your weapon moveset. 70% of those yokai cores are just trash that you have to manage more inventory for to level the few decent ones
[0:30:58] <%valriot> LUL
[0:30:59] <%SirGO0SE> Is a little sad tbh
[0:31:01] <%herecomesmong0> #BUYMEMECOIN
[0:31:01] <ChristopherWPoindexter> NODDERS NODDERS NODDERS
[0:31:02] <oda_flobunaga> There is an NFT of Woolie's face
[0:31:06] <%AncelDeLambert> like, you should be able to add "NFT" to your filter
[0:31:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's sad
[0:31:09] <mr_catsup> sadge
[0:31:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not sad for you, sad that it's their job
[0:31:13] <Profmcstevie> it's an NPC
[0:31:16] <+polothegreatest> Nft woolie? LUL
[0:31:17] <ChristopherWPoindexter> WHAT
[0:31:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Send them a Kirby dick pic
[0:31:23] <%Monkeyweed21> that G4 NFT guy was cringe
[0:31:23] <RyuuAoi> Okay that hurt.
[0:31:24] <JetpackMcQuack> dogs eating dogs
[0:31:24] <%valriot> Just some guy sending /Tell to you over and over
[0:31:26] <%afronooch> my last job was to be that person calling for surveys at the middle of night and I legitimately hated myself everyday I worked
[0:31:28] <%superc37> @datasuna dude yasuke and saika are the exact same as they were in 1. also with how op shit like sloth was, the nerf was kinda necessary
[0:31:32] <+DatAsuna> @Speed1ines It is a bigger game. It's not a replacement for Nioh 1. Playing both is better than only playing 2 and pretending you played 1.
[0:31:34] <%Speed1ines> @DatAsuna Living weapon is so much more boring then Yokai forms
[0:31:34] <%Birdigalore> So someone here is a secret crypto shitter
[0:31:35] <%tomdwarf> Yeah, in some ways its worse. Its deliberately ignoring a person's wishes.
[0:31:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Super creepy
[0:31:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh man, I hope that dude is watching
[0:31:38] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @profmcstevie I mean...they're acting like one with this.
[0:31:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> No they weren't!
[0:31:40] <scrumbotime> David Cage should make KoopyCoin
[0:31:45] <%RayReborne> THATS RAD, FUCK THAT GUY
[0:31:47] <%SinnerEbru> you know those emails are just templates right?
[0:31:50] <DracaenaLeaf> hello i am bot message
[0:31:51] <+ahmz1404> he's watching right now
[0:31:53] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @scrumbotime NODDERS
[0:31:56] <%JoshManVGH> My cert study guide has a chapter about Blockchain and I want to scream.
[0:31:58] <+SWFanatic> Wow Fry, I am so aroused by your CAN EAT ANYTHING attitude.
[0:31:59] <%tanarath> Block them?
[0:32:05] <RyuuAoi> Did you forward it to them?
[0:32:06] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @dracaenaleaf SilverHeadpat apriPet cdawgPet
[0:32:08] <Lucid_Dynamic> @afronooch Congratulations on your freedom.
[0:32:09] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat oh so it's like the voice calls of the people wanting to buy your property
[0:32:09] <%Shirousuke1989> I like NFTs... NICE FUCKING TITS
[0:32:14] <Profmcstevie> Hey big fan of API CHECK FOR HIGHEST VIEWERSHIP last year
[0:32:14] <%SaiyanShoto> There's a crypto shill among us
[0:32:14] <%HotSauceFiend> haha Temp-lates. Tuca and Berie joke
[0:32:15] <jetstreamlove_R> Can't you just block them?
[0:32:16] <jevichrono> @scrumbotime Oh noez, I made ze bad nfts
[0:32:16] <%MooseIsGoose> put camera on him
[0:32:16] <dimensaur> crypto Bros are the Kai leng of the internet
[0:32:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt at least they arent pushing NFTs on G4
[0:32:20] <+polothegreatest> Theres isnt automatic filter on email?
[0:32:21] <+tempestzephyr> ew
[0:32:22] <%Birdigalore> "Pat we really enjoyed your awesome stream of BUGSNAX!"
[0:32:23] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 In nioh 1 he's introduced having a mano amano showdown with you in a burning castle as his spirit manifests behind him giving him wings. In nioh 2 he just takes a potshot at you from a balcony in an empty room then jumps down.
[0:32:26] <%Djinnazz> It’s called block address Patrick
[0:32:29] <+DatAsuna> 2 is infinitely lamer betweent he 2
[0:32:31] <%justcallmebobplease> BIG PROGRESS
[0:32:33] <%RayReborne> dont apologize its honestly understamdable
[0:32:35] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU DID A GOOD NIOH
[0:32:38] <%SinnerEbru> blockchain pollution can be solved by smart lawmakers
[0:32:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> omg he's a human being how dare he Kappa
[0:32:39] <jetstreamlove_R> Keep yourself healthy pat
[0:32:40] <+SWFanatic> You are strong for continuing to engage in exposure therapy
[0:32:40] <RyuuAoi> You almost died tonight.
[0:32:41] <%XzileGaming> stop it son, you are doing me a frighten
[0:32:43] <SirMcSlushy> Was fun watching
[0:32:44] <%valriot> Its the same as those dumb porn accounts like "Wow, look at my HUGE boobers at .***
[0:32:46] <%SinnerEbru> unfortunately they dont exist
[0:32:52] <%angryoptimist> They can look up what your biggest stream was but they can't google "does pat say crypto is a scam at least monthly".
[0:32:53] <Lucid_Dynamic> We've been trying to reach you about your extended NFT
[0:32:55] <%Cozy90> You did hot Pat! <3
[0:32:57] <Profmcstevie> We sorted out a lot of goblins today
[0:33:03] <jorniev> no more  no more heroes
[0:33:04] <vVAstrAVv> theres still more goblins in nioh pat come ooooooonnnnn :p
[0:33:11] <%Monkeyweed21> vownloadable content
[0:33:11] <%RayReborne> @angryoptimist yeah exactly lol
[0:33:11] <jetstreamlove_R> If something happen, remember we love you!
[0:33:20] <%SirGO0SE> @SinnerEbru agreed. but i also think blockchain pollution is an overstated issue as every industry has disgusting levels of pollution. not the conversation for here though LUL
[0:33:21] <%superc37> @datasuna and living weapon has one boring moveset where you just spame square over and over again. and most of the cores arent trash, theyre just better for different builds lol
[0:33:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> You did a great job and I'm proud of you. Was definitely worth tossing my sub into that hat.
[0:33:22] <+polothegreatest> bleedPurple TakeNRG
[0:33:23] <%afronooch> bottom right next to trackbar
[0:33:26] <oda_flobunaga> You whip it out
[0:33:32] <+DatAsuna> @Speed1ines I enjoyed living weapon more because I had far more incentive to frequently use it in conjuction with my onmyo whereas the devil triggers in 2 just aren't strong enough to justify using resources on and their moveset sucks
[0:33:32] <oda_flobunaga> and measure
[0:33:36] <Profmcstevie> 3 hours of soooomethhhiiing
[0:33:43] <primaryfire> in 4k?
[0:33:44] <%JoshManVGH> Did you try Final Fantasy Origins Stranger in Paradise? It seemed WAY more streamlined than Nioh.
[0:33:44] <@Lion_kun> More Elden Ring!
[0:33:47] <%RayReborne> @cozy90 why is Hot a verb. it needs to be deleted as a verb LUL
[0:33:53] <jorniev> OH SHIT
[0:33:54] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @DatAsuna on that one I agree
[0:33:57] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @valriot literally!!! new, sussy baka accounts following you of "oh cute girl with almost no posts/followers/following," like, I'm single and looking...but not desperate  and respect myself plus others too much to do that
[0:33:59] <%HotSauceFiend> like a video essay?
[0:34:02] <+Savarro> Yooooooooo
[0:34:03] <jorniev> RECAP/ TIERLIST

[0:34:16] <%Birdigalore> December is FF14 stream month!
[0:34:17] <%Speed1ines> @Speed1ines No way, the devil triggers are way better, and onmyo isn't as bad as you make it, they nerfed sloth get over it
[0:34:17] <%superc37> @datasuna what in the livid fuck are you talking about bruh
[0:34:19] <vVAstrAVv> i still watch hws trailer sometimes
[0:34:19] <%SinnerEbru> @sirgo0se oh man id LOVE to talk abt industrialized pollution, but patstaresat's chat is not the place for it LUL
[0:34:23] <%AyotoCorp> Get a tiermaker set up
[0:34:29] <RyuuAoi> Like Fighterpedia?
[0:34:29] <%JoshManVGH> Great lead into Endwalker

[0:35:02] <%HotSauceFiend> lol just being a jackass
[0:35:04] <%SinnerEbru> nice burp
[0:35:04] <ChristopherWPoindexter> SilverSuffer
[0:35:07] <Visorak6> sparknotes
[0:35:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> He's asking if someone else already did the work
[0:35:14] <Profmcstevie> He's asking if we know a guy
[0:35:15] <@Ranryu692> he's asking to find out if anybody has already done the work
[0:35:18] <@GeneralSCPatton> Why agonize to summarize, when you can plagiarize?
[0:35:19] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @rayreborne nagLaugh
[0:35:21] <+HellCopter> @PatStaresAt Somebody did a retrospective of every class's changes over every patch, it was interesting but maybe a bit too in depth for this
[0:35:23] <%JoshManVGH> Big number patches only?
[0:35:25] <RyuuAoi> Like cliff notes or something
[0:35:32] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @generalscpatton NODDERS
[0:35:34] <%Speed1ines> @Speed1ines AND the dlc bosses are just icing on the cake and do stuff that are totally unique instead of the same crap over and over again
[0:35:38] <%RayReborne> protonChugga NotLikeThis
[0:35:41] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 The devil trigger forms are just underwhelming and at least living weapon I was able to immediately work into a build that would touch of death bosses from full health. Whereas the DTs are just underwhelming burst modes
[0:35:48] <%HotSauceFiend> Nioh would take forever to stream
[0:35:48] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:35:48] <oda_flobunaga> Using the the Brute counter to attack cancel your own recovery frames is soo broken
[0:35:50] <ChristopherWPoindexter> nagPeepohappy peepo
[0:35:50] <+ahmz1404> will you play Nioh in your off time?
[0:35:51] <%HotSauceFiend> its also bland
[0:35:52] <@Lion_kun> Nioh 2 however!
[0:35:57] <%SirGO0SE> thats a lot of content there tho
[0:36:00] <@Lion_kun> YEYEYEYE
[0:36:00] <+Savarro> So Nioh 2 then
[0:36:01] <+DatAsuna> @Speed1ines I do agree that the DLC for 2 is better than the DLC for 1
[0:36:04] <+RoeDeerRootie> Halo SP?
[0:36:06] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[0:36:06] <+applegreen92> Halo Infinite Campaign!!
[0:36:08] <%Monkeyweed21> February is FUCKED
[0:36:10] <%SinnerEbru> yeeeee nioh 2
[0:36:12] <RyuuAoi> GTA is going on, Pat!
[0:36:12] <%RayReborne> Big punch
[0:36:13] <@Ranryu692> how many months in a row of souls-likes do you want to do?
[0:36:13] <Profmcstevie> Just a taste
[0:36:15] <%AyotoCorp> Play Dark Souls 1 with the cursed mod
[0:36:15] <primaryfire> excited for the podcast discussion
[0:36:18] <+DatAsuna> But I think when they reuse bosses, they set up much lamer contexts for them
[0:36:20] <oda_flobunaga> Would be cool to see
[0:36:21] <vVAstrAVv> niph 2 is the best
[0:36:22] <%KishinGrek> how far are you in SMTV?
[0:36:24] <ChristopherWPoindexter> SilverThink
[0:36:26] <%SinnerEbru> aww giefy's snoring psaGief
[0:36:30] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Drop No more heroes for Project Wingman Kappa
[0:36:31] <%SinnerEbru> psaDogchamp
[0:36:36] <%RayReborne> a little
[0:36:40] <%RayReborne> psaDogchamp
[0:36:40] <@Lion_kun> Are you playing Lost Judgment on your off time?
[0:36:42] <%kknutson4> what about Deaths Gambit
[0:36:43] <ChristopherWPoindexter> NODDERS
[0:36:43] <RyuuAoi> Oh yeah a SMTV quick look would be dope.
[0:36:43] <+DatAsuna> It's like fighting ornstein in darksouls 2, yeah he's still ornstein but removed from his cool original context
[0:36:44] <%Speed1ines> @superc37 If you couldn't cheese the bosses with DT, then you didn't understand the DT system correctly. You can literally stay in DT for entire boss fights with the right build
[0:36:46] <ChristopherWPoindexter> SilverHeadpat
[0:37:01] <+KoldFusion87> Should a run through of FromSoft's games leading up to Elden Ring
[0:37:02] <%AncelDeLambert> there are many doors, Ed Boy
[0:37:12] <ChristopherWPoindexter> SilverZoom
[0:37:13] <%Birdigalore> lol
[0:37:14] <cs0402196> whatever happened to the malding guy?
[0:37:16] <cartakus> Nioh 2's weapons are so much better. Fuck the hidden skills though
[0:37:19] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 Staying in the mode isn't deleting the boss in a single combo
[0:37:21] <%AncelDeLambert> This is the Hat of Discipline. DO YOU LIVE IN A CAVE?!
[0:37:34] <+DatAsuna> I understand the DT system, I put in my time and finished the game. I just don't care
[0:37:41] <%SWFanatic> SWFanatic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Facing your fears takes a lot of courage. Good job. Ty for the streams. Zangief makes Bork Borks.
[0:37:43] <%HotSauceFiend> 4 was fun

[0:38:00] <%RayReborne> Pat Thinky
[0:38:01] <RyuuAoi> HOLY FUCK, PAT. PLAY YAKUZA DEAD SOULS
[0:38:02] <%herecomesmong0> its hard right
[0:38:11] <Zebroneath> 5 is pretty solid
[0:38:11] <%Speed1ines> @DatAsuna Sounds like you just weren't good at Nioh 2, couldn't find a cheese method, and are salting up
[0:38:17] <@Ranryu692> that's surprising to hear after how long you put it down for
[0:38:17] <+DatAsuna> Sorry for not jerking off at the sight or a devil trigger or declaring a game is great the second I see a judgment cut.
[0:38:18] <oda_flobunaga> ) 1 and 2 are great, I've never touched the Kiwamis
[0:38:19] <jorniev> @RyuuAoi EEEEEEW YEAH DO IT
[0:38:20] <+Kaiserzelcor> 5 has the most batshit final act
[0:38:21] <primaryfire> I love how personal 6 is
[0:38:32] <%HotSauceFiend> 6 was sloppy
[0:38:33] <dickbuttwoman> 5 is definitely the best one in terms of gameplay, too
[0:38:34] <%superc37> @datasuna dude living weapon was just "press r1 to kill." yeah they could buff it, but theres still nothing interesting or cool about that compared to having a proper dt with a proper moveset. plus burst counters are the shit
[0:38:34] <%RayReborne> @ryuuaoi what did Dead souls Suck your dick jeez LUL
[0:38:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> but you cried for daigo!
[0:38:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @datasuna 🥴🥴🥴🥴
[0:38:48] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna Sounds like you're just really unable to accept that someone found the devil trigger uninteresting and didn't use it
[0:38:48] <+polothegreatest> Daigo
[0:38:50] <%SaiyanShoto> Didn't you cry in 6?
[0:38:54] <@Lion_kun> 7,5,judgment,0, lost judgment, 4, 2, 6, 1, 3, dead souls.
[0:38:56] <%herecomesmong0> 5 was really solid 6 was a letdown

[0:39:41] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 It didn't have a proper moveset, and I preferred the reward of the setup from picking the right combinations that could combo into itself and syngergise well with my onmyo talismans
[0:39:46] <%RayReborne> big tired, big Pee

[0:41:04] <+DatAsuna> @superc37 I beta nioh 2, and it's a game worth playing. You're just getting weirdly defensive that I say to play both games and not only nioh 2
