[0:10:32] <DracaenaLeaf> I saw Advent Children when it was popular
[0:10:34] <%patriotrenegade> @JustinianKnight post a Strawpoll tso we can quantify how old Pat really feels
[0:10:34] <+TaylOctopus91> FF7 was probably my first or second PS1 game
[0:10:34] <GKannel> NOPE
[0:10:34] <%stovetopism> everyone should be somewhat familiar, there is no excuse
[0:10:38] <leargo> hello children
[0:10:38] <%BayowolfTerra> your making some big assumptions there
[0:10:39] <%TheDullaMAN> I'm only unfamiliar because I didn't have a Playstation
[0:10:39] <chambatron> Well it's actually great that your demographic is young so they won't die soon and will give you money
[0:10:40] <+manami4604> pat san
[0:10:40] <CptHarlok> FF6 was better IMO.
[0:10:41] <+TwinBat> I heard FF9 is better :)
[0:10:41] <%shadyesq> Played the shitake mushrooms out of it
[0:10:42] <Nina96> pat how young do u think we r?
[0:10:43] <otaku9392> ff4
[0:10:43] <FeelinNifty> Final Fantasy started at XIII
[0:10:43] <%patriotrenegade> I hear Aerith dies
[0:10:43] <Tracazoid> There's a Final Fantasy prior to Dirge of Cerberus? Kappa
[0:10:43] <%nmaten> ff 5 advance tho
[0:10:44] <$joylent_blue> i know FF7 BACKWARD AND FORWARD
[0:10:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I watched Max play it. But I guess I can watch someone who isn't a fan play it
[0:10:45] <Hiruzen93> Oh your so condescending
[0:10:45] <%Svanyr> Svanyr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 31 months oh boy! God 3 Houses is eating up my game time. Hard mode doesnt really feel that hard. Keep up the good work and I look forward to experiencing FF7 for the first time through strem.
[0:10:45] <%badchoice5> I have literally heard no one say that Pt
[0:10:48] <gypsystranger> ffx was the shit
[0:10:49] <@Mechz71> I only played 13 and 14
[0:10:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> Final fantasy what?
[0:10:49] <corn_dad> FF6 is so much better
[0:10:49] <@JustinianKnight> I guess I could
[0:10:50] <%salty_syd913> i dodged 13 like a fucking bullet
[0:10:52] <darcfowler1995> 15 was okay it could have been a lot better
[0:10:52] <+Katalist_> I played FF7 on its original release
[0:10:52] <Aydarkzero> i made it to the end of ff7 but i never finished it or remember even playing it
[0:10:53] <gypsystranger> so was ff7
[0:10:54] <%templar010> FF9 was superior but FF7 is great
[0:10:56] <+manami4604> ff6 better by lots
[0:10:56] <@JustinianKnight> oh Joy no
[0:10:56] <%docpepperphd> born in 98, played through ff7 when i was 14
[0:10:57] <%tearknack> @AngriestPat what do you think caused the stinky divide?
[0:10:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Ozymandias555 That's just true. 9 is the best 3D final fantasy
[0:10:58] <starotter70> But Pat, what about FF8?
[0:11:02] <sentientvin> never played it
[0:11:02] <joelio475> Pretty sure most people here are over 25
[0:11:03] <%theslippybrit> @AngriestPat i only played ffx demo this is my first ff, please be gentle
[0:11:03] <%patriotrenegade> doodMako
[0:11:05] <AMajorTom> Materia!
[0:11:06] <%jerree66> ff12 the best
[0:11:06] <%Gogogolem> I only know what people in 14 told me
[0:11:06] <%colouroftheiris77> I know literally nothing about FF7
[0:11:06] <%badchoice5> Don't you generalize me Pat
[0:11:06] <SoaringLettuce> my first FF game was ten
[0:11:07] <%SolidusRex> SolidusRex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Been looking forward to this stream, FFVII is one of my top three FF games alongside FFV and FFIX
[0:11:09] <alrobot2014> i somehow got into this series even though my first interactions with it were Spirits Within, Advent Children, and FFX-2
[0:11:10] <person181> i don't like what i know about it, it seems kinda lame
[0:11:10] <+Aeogard> but 12is the best final fantasy though?
[0:11:11] <+Bad1uck> If FF14 is a disappointment I want to be disappointed with everything in life
[0:11:11] <%vaporousTippler> I mean, I'm playing fucking Daggerfall at the moment, so...FF7 will look new.
[0:11:11] <Ghost__Pantsu> I got pretty far in this game then touched a Weapon and lost hours of progress :)
[0:11:11] <+chaumiester> Have you added all the Mods onto FF7 Like Max did with his playthrough of FF7
[0:11:12] <Lucifer753> @AngriestPat how long u gonna keep Aeris in the party?
[0:11:12] <majindusto> 11 is a Dumb MMO...and 14 is too

[0:11:16] <%TheWinged7> yup, parents that wouldnt let us have a console till the wii, so no chance
[0:11:16] <%GyroBrando> Played ff7 im young not dumb
[0:11:16] <@JustinianKnight> It's amazing
[0:11:16] <$Sir_stride> FF8 is the best worst final fantasy
[0:11:17] <Valdorick> FF7 is a solid #3, behind FF9 and 6
[0:11:17] <+MaouKara> Dont u dare
[0:11:17] <%SirGO0SE> fuck ff8
[0:11:17] <%blademaster247> What about FF6?

[0:11:34] <%funkygene> FF8 had that card game!
[0:11:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> FF6 is the best Final Fantasy game.
[0:11:35] <VidyusMaximus> FF8 is fine
[0:11:35] <%blademaster247> TRIPLE TRIAD
[0:11:35] <+Katalist_> 8 is the best one

[0:28:34] <tungstenviper> @hassanico1 Japan has very weird tastes

[0:28:43] <%Frost_Quill> I always preferred Tifa to Aerith until I saw the designs for the remake. I really, really like how Aerith looks in that game.

[0:29:28] <hassanico1> @JustinianKnight Like, I struggle to think of an FF concept from any game that wasn't referenced or flat out added in FF14

[0:32:39] <%Rain_Mage> FF7 is awesome, though I think I've not liked the hard tech shift
[0:32:39] <Shastafield> outdated, overrated, weeb trash
[0:32:39] <@Mechz71> Is not Chaos Legion

[0:32:46] <shieldecho> i like it well enough but ix is better.

[0:33:08] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> Never played it. I think that FF7 is a very nostalgic and nicely made JRPG. Holds the same fame as like Smash Melee
[0:33:08] <audrus> the prerendered background always put me off from diving into it deep

[0:33:54] <+MisterRockett> I'm 24! Never touched it before the age of 22 I think? Got the airship in Disc 2 and pausing before I got Enemy Skill hunting. Most noticeable thing to have happened is that it was 30 hours until I found the "Arrange Materia" menu. Hated the Materia system before that. Now I love it. Easy organization makes all the difference.

[0:34:45] <$joylent_blue> devil may z is my favorite game
[0:34:45] <TheEvilOmega> When I beat FF7, I was scarfing down some taco bell during the long ass cutscene from Super Nova.
[0:34:45] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat So, you’re not going to 100% this right?
[0:34:47] <Crimpson> I am playing FF15 again on PC to get all the DLC story and such I missed on the original release.

[2:09:24] <Liquid_Dio> CLUMBOBINE is strong
[2:09:24] <Torruun> You know what the funny thing is. You could make 3,000 Gil in like, half an hour.

[2:10:02] <chad_irl> Clumbo's got the hover hands at night
[2:10:03] <OwlLightningMage> you gotta shove them in your ass and sneeze
[2:10:03] <DublinRage> I liked this theme when they did a mash-up of it and John Cena
[2:10:05] <+PlagueOfGripes> optional tutorial time. you didn't have to do this
[2:10:06] <%mostundesired> IMMERSION BROKEN
[2:10:08] <InugamiTheHound> Cloud is 21, Areith is 22,Tifa=20, Barret=35,Red 13=48 is dog years, Cid=32,Yuffie=16, Caith Sith=????, Vincent= 27 (this is according to FF7 in game booklet)
[2:10:12] <Louie_Salmon> What an interesting way to frame a tutorial, as you explaining it to someone else
[2:10:16] <+Ell1ot> you make Chewie go up for date
[2:10:18] <Tha_Mik> wasting time
[2:10:21] <+Tarage> J-J-JAM IT IN
[2:10:22] <Dementedpenguin> I forgot how annoying that blinking is.....
[2:10:23] <alrobot2014> the pc version of this tutorial for me completely fast forwarded all the way through
[2:10:24] <%supercasualboom> Materia is basically how to put a condom on a banana
[2:10:24] <agadejobi> These names you gave them are killing me
[2:10:25] <+XLZ_0R> @hassanico1 Other examples?
[2:10:28] <BoneofMalkav> Cloud: "What's a Materia Menu?! What reality is this?!"
[2:10:30] <%Diabetic> Tutorial is flashing "Please kill me I'm trapped doing these tutorials for Square"
[2:10:31] <+MisterRockett> Paying super attention to if they show you were the Arrange Matera menu is cause it took me 30 hours of gameplay time before I found it
[2:10:33] <hassanico1> @XLZ_0R the whole game
[2:10:38] <+Deano8817> Cloud is younger then me NotLikeThis
[2:10:40] <hassanico1> @XLZ_0R anything relating to Cloud
[2:10:41] <Tennochief> Shove that Materia between Knuckle's tits
[2:10:52] <ミュウレ4242> there are ssome spiffy mods for this game, if you're looking for a slightly different experience.
[2:10:59] <thesaltysenpai> so what would be the best way to play FF7. never played it and I'm kinda curious.
[2:11:00] <MicrotonalMatt> Barrett made it this far without knowing how to open the menu
[2:11:01] <DublinRage> Watch out for those pointy bits
[2:11:03] <wookie5358> Back then it was like "You mean menus can have more than two colors? It can never get better than this"
[2:11:10] <%Diabetic> @ミュウレ4242 this is Switch version
[2:11:10] <gloriousdemon> Tutorial Tutorial Tutorial......
[2:11:13] <hassanico1> Chat does this theme ever play again? It doesn't doesn't it
[2:11:14] <pokketlint60> Does that mean everyone has a menu?
[2:11:20] <starotter70> Can't wait to see Clumbo give Knuckles the Sticko
[2:11:23] <pokketlint60> @hassanico1 Yeah this is Barret's Theme.
[2:11:23] <%croxeye> hey pat, make your menu all hideous
[2:11:29] <TimetodiveLTX> tfw you've never opened your menu
[2:11:30] <%ShortStackGamer516> ShortStackGamer516 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Love the content. Keep it coming. Have you seen the Akechi trailer for P5R yet?
[2:11:31] <+barkon345> @thesaltysenpai either the steam or the switch version

[2:11:39] <%Diabetic> Peach I need some ASMR chewing
[2:11:39] <gloriousdemon> Stark white on white background
[2:11:40] <blaine_themono> @Deano8817 you can think of ur grandpa telling his childhood stories if it makes you feel less old
[2:11:41] <shotgang86> yes Pat, tighten her bottom
[2:11:44] <%TheWinged7> "tighten the bottom"
[2:11:50] <ミュウレ4242> time lo learn to invest in yourself.
[2:11:51] <thesaltysenpai> oh it's on Switch? sweet.
[2:11:51] <Silent_Fyraena> But when you lose your god damn MAGIC ROCKS you can't do SHIT because you're a dumbarse with a big hunk of metal and nothing else!! D:
[2:11:52] <+Grayhammatter> slap the bottom
[2:11:55] <pokketlint60> Guys you don't get it, Barett can't open menus because he only has one arm
[2:11:56] <%supercasualboom> Cloud: Materia doubles as anal beads!!!
[2:11:59] <ThatGuyThere03> OH MAN
[2:12:01] <%Octakon910> @PlagueOfGripes No Eli, he has to do all the tutorial.
[2:12:04] <$spleekle> Change your menu colors to green and purple
[2:12:08] <%juxtest> Oh sure you talk about wanting to save the planet from Shinra, and yet you use a Shinra ShiMenu.
[2:12:09] <%mostundesired> ????

[2:12:36] <chad_irl> I keep 2 materia lodged in my asshole as an emergency power source, I call it The Shining Dragon
[2:12:37] <Silent_Fyraena> It's fitting that materia gets shoved up your big fat arse :V
[2:12:39] <Djinnazz> bullshit it's is
[2:12:39] <%OdysseyKnight> Yeah but overuse it to optimize materia growth
[2:12:40] <Tha_Mik> just spam summons
[2:12:43] <Silent_Fyraena> Where it belongs :P
[2:12:45] <Aydarkzero> i just stacked all the magic Kappa
[2:12:46] <pokketlint60> Does anyone ever try to put Materia directly into themselves instead of in armor and weapons?
[2:12:47] <Mr_Strut> That reminds me I got to download all those tifa doujins now that panda is back
[2:12:48] <+barkon345> @thesaltysenpai The steam version if you think you might play the game agian becasue you can install a tone of different mods to give you a different experience
[2:12:49] <+MisterRockett> Does my navel count as a Materia slot?
[2:12:56] <Ultimatefool> How the FUCK is Elmo so powerful already

[2:28:23] <StrangeCoincidence> infinite xp worthless when you never need to grind in this game

[2:28:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @supercasualboom 'tis a hive of scum and villainy
[2:28:36] <+chaumiester> Is it just me or does the game look... sped up? Was that a feature in the original game?
[2:28:37] <Jolly_Adventurer> H-he's fast
[2:28:38] <StrangeCoincidence> nothing here
[2:28:40] <starotter70> Nah
[2:28:42] <salstrane> there's something
[2:28:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat that's at the end of the game
[2:28:43] <salstrane> i think
[2:28:46] <Triplicat> dragon quest was the series that was bad for that for a while
[2:28:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's doing 3x speed
[2:28:48] <StrangeCoincidence> there's nothing
[2:28:49] <orangecoloredskystream> Gotta go fast.

[2:29:44] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Pat, do you realize what you've done? Look at the first letter of the party's names
[2:29:44] <%pwnjones> FF1 on NES diddn't switch if an enemy died.
[2:29:45] <%Owkono> are you going to grind or go normally?

[2:34:11] <%manwithboxonhead> Somewhere Magical
[2:34:13] <agadejobi> Rude has a crush on Tifa, so he'll only attack her 1/3 of the time
[2:34:25] <Reanimator83> Pat, did you or Paige ever beat Octopath Traveler?
[2:34:28] <Tennochief> you missed that other guy
[2:34:30] <%ssjklyco> ssjklyco subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Did you know, Rap is just the opposite of Country music. Think about it.

[2:34:50] <+vampireinarm> what part of the game we at
[2:34:55] <InugamiTheHound> Reno and Rude were voice by Quinton Flynn and Crispin Freeman.

[2:36:18] <salstrane> I got to the third disc in FF7, just above the hole leading to the end, when my save got corrupted. always rotate
[2:36:21] <wookie5358> Think of all the job openings after we wipe out this quadrant of the city
[2:36:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> he said as he sped through the battle
[2:36:26] <@lewdskeletor13> This music is great, first tome hearing a lot of it
[2:36:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes it is @PlagueOfGripes. Yes it is.
[2:36:29] <bestwaifuritsu> good game but no furry girls to draw
[2:36:34] <%supercasualboom> Pizza needs that red sauce...of murder innocent victims
[2:36:41] <%weissguard> For real this time tho, Banger INCOMING.
[2:36:41] <iambqb> Pat also endulges in another form of Eco Terrorism, where his actions terrorize the planet with the power of littering

[2:36:43] <%RupanSen> Max' modded version kinda spoiled me on vanilla
[2:36:45] <InugamiTheHound> besides Barret any other character do you have to set in the back row
[2:36:47] <agadejobi> I know it's not my game; but the fact that they don't have the default names is triggering this homeboy something fierce
[2:36:49] <MoonObscure> D:
[2:36:50] <thegreenbenis> Large beef
[2:36:51] <%juxtest> The Echo!

[2:37:11] <wookie5358> Swordles
[2:37:12] <bestwaifuritsu> Cait Sith is a robot though
[2:37:14] <+vampireinarm> do you think they waited this long to release FF7 remake because of real world TROUBLES back in the day, like 18 years back in the day
[2:37:16] <samirrsp> doodNuts doodNuts doodNuts
[2:37:20] <majindusto> Its such bullshit that the actors who have been playing these characters since Kingdom Hearts 1 got tossed aside...While the Japanese voices got to stay BibleThump
[2:37:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> Gooood times.
[2:37:22] <+linSP> does clodd have brain porblems
[2:37:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> say his name say his name
[2:37:23] <salstrane> haha
[2:37:25] <%gespenst25> Say my name. Say my name. Sephiroth.
[2:37:25] <Fear_Ranjer> SO
[2:37:25] <%Frost_Quill> Knuckles did wear a cowboy hat at one point.
[2:37:26] <starotter70> LUL
[2:37:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sepiroth
[2:37:33] <chronoxgp> this isnt much different from fight club
[2:37:33] <%segonian> nah forget
[2:37:34] <ElementalX1000> She even has the hat like Knuckles did in the OVA movie
[2:37:35] <InugamiTheHound> but yet she's dating Cloud who is a Soldier and from Shinra.
[2:37:36] <Burningjaso> doodNuts
[2:37:38] <+Jhylla81> Cloud off his anti-psychotic medication.
[2:37:44] <+BigBech> is this xbone or switch?
[2:37:48] <InugamiTheHound> switch
[2:37:48] <Sokumotanaka> That was the night that knuckles...didn't chuckles
[2:37:52] <%gespenst25> switch
[2:38:03] <Fear_Ranjer> "Blood Taste" oh boy that's wonderful
[2:38:04] <@StridentSong> Vincent needs to be Squall
[2:38:06] <TastySammiches> its all based on the steam version
[2:38:07] <Tennochief> oh boy
[2:38:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> pat doesn't own an xbone silly
[2:38:08] <ScreamLord> Sephiroth kinda sounds like the name of a Lovecraftian nightmare god now that I think about it
[2:38:08] <gwynslastknight> Finally I get to attend a pat Stream
[2:38:13] <+BigBech> think im gonna get this at switch for the sake of playing while pooping :)

[2:38:29] <thegreenbenis> ROTATE SAVES
[2:38:33] <ミュウレ4242> ScreamLord, it's the name of some actual angel i think.
[2:38:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> Now I want to see Pat and Paige play Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes together.
[2:38:36] <agadejobi> Sephiroth's name is based on an angel or something like that
[2:38:43] <agadejobi> I was reading it on the TV Tropes today
[2:38:44] <miendrh93> In some cases, I figure the voice changes are just from the actors either aging out of the roles in a way that English folks would notice, or because they don't want to deal with certain associations that Americans might have with certain voices.
[2:38:47] <%ssjklyco> So, Team Four Star has changed my perception of Tifas personality and forgot she wasn't as hard boiled in actual FF7
[2:38:48] <+Intolerable> @plagueofgripes You Goddamn right
[2:38:56] <agadejobi> Once I read "this troper" three times, that's when I turn off the page
[2:38:58] <thegreenbenis> ROTATE YOUR SAVES
[2:39:07] <%mostundesired> I'm sorry?
[2:39:10] <+BoboDaHobo> about to make the dive and buy the new fire emblem. Your Twitter ad campaign worked
[2:39:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh god, Pat and Paige playing that bomb defusing game...what a nightmare that would be
[2:39:13] <Tennochief> TV Tropes self inserts too much
[2:39:14] <+MeatBomb> Can someone link cool ranch?
[2:39:15] <%Rain_Mage> You should name Vincent Cool Ranch
[2:39:15] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes That way she compliments Tifa and her huge, round boobs
[2:39:15] <miendrh93> Nah, rotating saves is for cowards
[2:39:24] <bestwaifuritsu> GAY420GAY "Cool Ranch!"

[2:40:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...that whole "spoiler" is pretty much on par with Darth Vader being Luke's dad.
[2:40:41] <%BayowolfTerra> eh, it's not that funny
[2:40:45] <InugamiTheHound> Remember when Cloud use to work at McDonalds from that skit on robot chicken?
[2:40:46] <chronoxgp> starting to rut
[2:40:48] <agadejobi> I don't kow, on one hand, there's a whole generation who hasn't experienced the game

[2:41:37] <Silent_Fyraena> EAT TENT, GAIN HP
[2:41:44] <chronoxgp> this game came out when i was 8

[2:43:09] <agadejobi> Or is the this one they use to frame them?
[2:43:10] <$rekinom> I feel like he'd remember the name clumbo
[2:43:11] <miendrh93> Unless you got severe magic, bulletproof armor equipped
[2:43:11] <alrobot2014> when the president shows up to confront the terrorists personally
[2:43:12] <majindusto> Can't wait for the CPR minigame where Cloud doesn't want to save a little girl because he has to"technically" kiss her

[2:46:29] <%weissguard> @Tennochief Reminder, They used a character who had an undefined power set at the time (Yang) to fight Tifa.
[2:46:29] <agadejobi> Isn't this thing weak to lightning?
[2:46:30] <chronoxgp> nah he's just thicc
[2:46:31] <%logoth_> ded

[2:46:41] <Tennochief> @goose_attack_almanac "Yang got punched through a pillar, therefore she's more durable than Tifa"
[2:46:44] <+paladinstarbuster> and sephiroth is stronger than Vergil meaning link is as strong as Dante
[2:46:46] <Nina96> @thelaxinator ah makes sense

[2:47:06] <salstrane> so how does Cloud survive this fall again?
[2:47:07] <bestwaifuritsu> Airbuster is ai programmed to turn around and attack whoever attacked him last until low hp, which can be abused to deal extra damage from behind.

[3:02:17] <gloriousdemon> Titan bangle to restore all

[3:02:44] <%Frost_Quill> @earthboy2k He'll try but he doesn't remember how.
[3:02:46] <agadejobi> They were in a lot of anime together
[3:02:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's the edge of the dome.
[3:02:48] <%mastertwin2> wait, people can't just LEAVE?
[3:02:58] <Aydarkzero> imagine that part in the remake
[3:03:01] <Neoripo> noescape
[3:03:02] <reinbachthe3rd> The hellscape future where corporations trap us inside of their shit-tier, dystopian society.
[3:03:03] <mankeyfigh> Move her from the back she's too weak
[3:03:04] <wookie5358> Nah they're all locked in
[3:03:06] <$joylent_blue> yeah make sure to give Ass4Dayz all your sources
[3:03:08] <%Ninestempest> from my googling isn't don's pick random
[3:03:10] <$spleekle> Cant leave because they being opressed by the PIZZA
[3:03:12] <+Grayhammatter> they are sucked in?
[3:03:13] <miendrh93> @reinbachthe3rd , I admittedly run things a bit more rustic, so that my only equipment is a couple of carboys, a stockpot, and some tubing for syphoning the must without disturbing the sediment at the bottom (And, of course, the bottles and corks). Works well enough for an apartment setting and when I'm not too finicky about the clarity of wines, since I don't do racking and whatnot.
[3:03:16] <chronoxgp> kind of like darling in the franxx
[3:03:18] <alrobot2014> they're stuck in the box for this pizza
[3:03:24] <TheGershon> The town song reminds me of a VN, but I can't remember which one
[3:03:24] <%Grimlockfly> The pizza is the oppressor
[3:03:25] <majindusto> Hedgehog Pie's!!!
[3:03:26] <%mastertwin2> well that changes a LOT of context on Midgar
[3:03:26] <%PanicSwytch> Poor cloud, Aerith is just stringing him along. She only wants Zack's D
[3:03:28] <InugamiTheHound> wow that monster looks nasty and not that far away from the children
[3:03:28] <$joylent_blue> Ninestempest nope, depends on what wig/dress you get as Cloud

[3:03:51] <%Ninestempest> @joylent_blue huh, neato, didn't know you could pick other ones when i replayd this a month or so ago
[3:03:53] <poweredscoot> Oh no delinquents
[3:03:54] <orangecoloredskystream> If people could leave everyone in the slums would move to the idyllic countryside that exists basically everywhere other than Midgar and that one other industrial ocean city and there would be no plot.
[3:03:56] <mankeyfigh> HALVES ATTACK
[3:03:57] <bestwaifuritsu> the area with the crane is where it shows up

[3:23:18] <MasterDecoder> @Kirby_Sauce Don't forget your checks

[3:23:19] <$spleekle> Clumbo will remember that
[3:23:40] <wookie5358> Should name someone sphincter spelunker

[3:23:43] <bear_breaker20> if only you could name sephiroth too
[3:23:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> @MasterDecoder there's no-one here to get them from tonight. Have to do it tomorrow
[3:23:55] <%Rust_Wick> sephiroth would be oedipus
[3:23:56] <starotter70> "Sephiroth!" "Clumbo!"

[3:27:59] <%Frost_Quill> @Nina96 Repairing stuff.
[3:28:03] <+PlagueOfGripes> you have to go up there to trigger the whole thing first
[3:28:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not sure if that's a good business model
[3:28:03] <wookie5358> Digestive at the phaarmacy, bring it to the bar
[3:28:21] <+PlagueOfGripes> for doo doo

[3:28:57] <smugjorgen> wau you remember this way better then max did
[3:28:58] <miendrh93> The houses suck
[3:29:02] <turf_wind_and_fire> Clumbo has to destroy a toilet
[3:29:02] <wookie5358> I think they've already promised this would be in
[3:29:03] <miendrh93> this one inn is good
[3:29:04] <$joylent_blue> its in the next screen up
[3:29:05] <%Frost_Quill> With the Honey-whatever gay brothel.
[3:29:06] <%Keyd00d> Poo. I mean, hello
[3:29:06] <%crimsonharvest> this better be a grimy ass dumptown like the DQ11 slum times a thousand
[3:29:12] <wookie5358> But the honeybee inn will probably be changed
[3:29:15] <starotter70> Some portions of this quest can be a LOT creepier in the remake
[3:29:16] <@JustinianKnight> Honeybee Inn
[3:29:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 I don't know too much about this game, (mostly cause i avoid it out of spite). Not gonna be here for the answer to this question, but who's the most weird-ass character you get in your party? Anyway, gotta finish up my shift, then go home and listen to astrolounge.
[3:29:24] <%RupanSen> I love how everything looks like a little diorama in FF7

[3:30:37] <miendrh93> This game is where I incorrectly learned the word Dilettante
[3:30:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> dilettante is an odd word to use for him. means he's a fanatical 'expert' in something without having any expertise in it

[3:50:37] <%hussdogrob> 3d models of all their uncomfortable bulges
[3:50:38] <%RupanSen> it will be either REALLY weird or REALLY different
[3:50:39] <smugjorgen> they sayd they were gonna tone down this scene in remake
[3:50:40] <Fear_Ranjer> I mean it could be less uncomfortable if they're going to put it in
[3:50:41] <xeros720> i forgot to ask Max if he did the FULL outfit

[3:50:51] <disflipmat> @Tennochief The fuck room you just have a mental breakdown thinking about Jenova and Sephiroth and you wake up to a girl slapping you and she gives you her underwear
[3:50:51] <@StridentSong> He got a +3
[3:50:52] <+maxtheflea> Trap cloud is best Cloud dont @ me

[3:50:53] <%Keyd00d> oh my
[3:50:54] <@JustinianKnight> they confirmed that crossdressing is in at the least
[3:50:58] <NeroInfinite> Gonnabe weird to VA that part
[3:50:58] <LeftOverPizza13> open minded women
[3:51:03] <mankeyfigh> SQUATD
[3:51:06] <mankeyfigh> SQUATS
[3:51:10] <NeroInfinite> buy dress
[3:51:12] <Guardiansaiyan> You still need the WIG Pat
[3:51:12] <TastySammiches> that would've been amazing
[3:51:12] <Tha_Mik> is that the good sound?
[3:51:13] <starotter70> That would be amazing
[3:51:13] <%crimsonharvest> I wish Cloud wsa named Claude or maybe JP
[3:51:13] <@commanderclaw> Paige, please, I can only handle so much
[3:51:15] <Tennochief> @disflipmat holy shit that's intense
[3:51:15] <Guardiansaiyan> W I G
[3:51:19] <goddomove> HSWP
[3:51:19] <$Dakuu75> they confirmed it? really? nice.
[3:51:20] <bringmoreknives> POO?
[3:51:20] <transporterthesequel> Must squat for PERFUUUME
[3:51:21] <@StridentSong> Squats, and you need the most expensive item from the hotel over night
[3:51:24] <+nathandiel> BIG BRO
[3:51:25] <@JustinianKnight> but it will likely be different
[3:51:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should ask Paige to put makeup on him, see how fast she responds.
[3:51:27] <King_thunder365> I hope in the remake you can make Cloud look like Ziggy Stardust
[3:51:27] <MoonObscure> LOL
[3:51:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> need wig and diamond tiara
[3:51:28] <$joylent_blue> but... the GROUP ROOM
[3:51:30] <+Addem_Up> ass virginity's gone forever
[3:51:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> FF7 is NOTHIN without crossdressing
[3:51:30] <wookie5358> Crossdressing is also story relevant
[3:51:33] <disflipmat> @Tennochief The Group Room is way more memorable and entertaining, though
[3:51:34] <sectorquack> what is in the fuck room
[3:51:36] <Neoripo> She just sploshed watching Cloud's makeup face
[3:51:36] <thegreenbenis> Save before squatz
[3:51:38] <Fear_Ranjer> ...... wig
[3:51:40] <krymzen5> i hope they have barret rate clouds thusting skillz
[3:51:42] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat did you see max put on a dress while playing once
[3:51:42] <@JustinianKnight> yea need to buy the Golden Set
[3:51:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @HeadsHeldHigh TRUTH
[3:51:44] <mankeyfigh> OVERCHARGED
[3:51:45] <wookie5358> Honeybee is going to be a bit iffy, though. That's a controversy waiting to happen
[3:51:45] <NeroInfinite> AEirth was ahooker
[3:51:47] <%Owkono> tiara from materia shop
[3:51:47] <+Draylle> Aeris was "entertaing" the group outside
[3:51:48] <MichaelDood> Ass Virginity ™
[3:51:52] <@lewdskeletor13> The whole game falls apart without the cross dressing
[3:51:52] <shinichizio> Rooking this guy for 500g for a flower is great
[3:51:57] <%Keyd00d> only for prudes
[3:51:57] <$joylent_blue> it is to somebody
[3:51:57] <%TheWinged7> i hope tehy make cloud all bishi for it
[3:51:58] <%nmaten> nah its not offensive
[3:51:59] <mayorrev> naaaaah its fiiiine
[3:52:00] <GypsySquid> Aerith had a hustle.
[3:52:01] <starotter70> Eh
[3:52:02] <EuropantLamprey> No
[3:52:03] <artoflec> its offensive to enough people that they wont do it elaFeels
[3:52:04] <ittla> as a big gay, I dont think it's offensive in the slightest
[3:52:05] <starotter70> Nah
[3:52:05] <thegreenbenis> Butt virginity
[3:52:05] <+jorgamund> it's not offensive, and anyone who gets butthurt over it can STFU
[3:52:07] <CalderGaming> depends on the execution
[3:52:07] <%RupanSen> everything's offensive nowadays
[3:52:09] <+LowBatteryLife> Oh it's hella offensive but i'm laughing my gay ass off
[3:52:10] <@JustinianKnight> the Honeybee Inn stuff is iffy
[3:52:11] <Eirykr> who cares if it offends people, its funny
[3:52:12] <MoonObscure> some idiot gonna get offended , is what fruit cakes do now days
[3:52:12] <%Edgy_Macaroon> someone will find it offensive
[3:52:15] <%AncelDeLambert> the dorky minigames are what MAKES this game good. Cut any of them and you lose something important.
[3:52:19] <DocMadfox> It's offensive to people that have no sense of humor
[3:52:23] <goddomove> Pat u're black? I knew it
[3:52:23] <+earthboy2k> California will find a way to be offended
[3:52:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that might be cut.
[3:52:26] <%Keyd00d> there WILL be kotaku articles
[3:52:26] <krymzen5> i bet there will be fake outrage
[3:52:27] <%nmaten> but thats the best room
[3:52:27] <$joylent_blue> Japan also probably doesn't give a shit about that
[3:52:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Some group will say its corrupting children or something
[3:52:29] <mayorrev> DONT CUT OUT THE BEAR ROOM
[3:52:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> THEY BATHE TOGETHER.
[3:52:30] <%MagickBurritoh> IT HURTS
[3:52:31] <wookie5358> Oh stuff happens. the camera cuts it though
[3:52:32] <Neoripo> They just need to fix the dialogue. in JP the creep is not that strong
[3:52:33] <@commanderclaw> They scrub up together
[3:52:33] <Fear_Ranjer> HE WAKES UP ON THE BED
[3:52:34] <Louie_Salmon> IT HURTS
[3:52:34] <+I_speel_my_dreenk> It wasn't even bad! It's fine!
[3:52:35] <%hussdogrob> so long as there is no Cocaine ITS FINE!
[3:52:37] <Tha_Mik> But Japan
[3:52:38] <$spleekle> Kotaku would get way too many articles out of that LUL
[3:52:38] <%AncelDeLambert> they're in the hot springs, that's it
[3:52:39] <thegreenbenis> IT HURTS
[3:52:40] <%Das_Bass> noooo dont cut it!!!

[3:52:45] <wiikai> 4k buff dudes
[3:52:45] <sectorquack> they better keep it
[3:52:46] <+Addem_Up> IT HURTS
[3:52:47] <wookie5358> You'll know in remake
[3:52:48] <xeros720> i think they'll do it the same way, just cut off everything below their necks
[3:52:48] <disflipmat> NOTHING GOOD HAPPENED
[3:52:49] <+solomonpun> Its the implicaiton.
[3:52:49] <$joylent_blue> paige.........

[3:52:50] <wookie5358> That's the problem
[3:52:51] <%nmaten> theyre talking about a rubber ducky
[3:52:52] <Louie_Salmon> IT HURTS PAIGE
[3:52:52] <+Grayhammatter> the camera could just pan up
[3:52:53] <+Draylle> its all about the implications
[3:52:54] <NeroInfinite> It's implied paige

[4:00:19] <+Grayhammatter> clumbette
[4:00:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> Push your ASS out Clumbo
[4:00:20] <Fathuran> Miss Clumbo, I LOVE IT!
[4:00:22] <+daisyyyy> You'd be surprised
[4:00:23] <ミュウレ4242> they sell frilly undied for muscular men on amazon these days.
[4:00:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> clum all over clumbette
[4:00:25] <xeros720> well fitting clothes is good business
[4:00:26] <%Scottigecko> not sure how long term a future that business has
[4:00:27] <Valdorick> Clumbohead
[4:00:29] <ミュウレ4242> undies, even.
[4:00:31] <majindusto> Old Man Gieseppie's
[4:00:38] <Tennochief> CLAMBO
[4:00:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @ミュウレ4242 nice username
[4:00:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Man Ass4Dayz is really enjoying this huh
[4:00:46] <mankeyfigh> WHATS WEIRD IS AERITH looks better the better you look
[4:00:48] <Mr_Strut> PEEK
[4:00:50] <takokasa> Time to peek super hard
[4:00:51] <%THATGUY_789> @lewdskeletor13 shudda guessed
[4:00:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ayy
[4:00:54] <Tennochief> noice
[4:00:55] <@commanderclaw> She's not as hot as Cloud
[4:00:56] <$MachoMadnesss94> yeye
[4:01:00] <+Hick12> Should have peeked. Become pervert.
[4:01:01] <lokiluko> well if the service is discounted enough, I have to do it. At 50% off its free, at 75% they're basically paying me to cross dress, how could I say no to that?
[4:01:10] <+LowBatteryLife> Aeris is such a weirdo and I love it.
[4:01:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yea
[4:01:15] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat get hit on by the f\guys at the bottom
[4:01:16] <Neoripo> Same
[4:01:16] <starotter70> His walk of shame is the best
[4:01:17] <orangecoloredskystream> Considering Act 1 is a 60 hour full game now, not only will this sequence be in the remake in it's entirety, but it'll be even more detailed.
[4:01:19] <$MachoMadnesss94> hey
[4:01:21] <+C24U> There probably is a mod
[4:01:22] <Fear_Ranjer> YES
[4:01:22] <starotter70> Do it in REMAKE
[4:01:25] <+Hick12> Hopefully the remake lets you fight as girl.
[4:01:26] <ミュウレ4242> need mods for battle kimono.
[4:01:31] <ittla> at least cloud will be the prettiest girl in HD
[4:01:32] <%ssjklyco> it will probably be a a skin in the remake
[4:01:33] <ittla> i hope
[4:01:33] <mayorrev> remind me again whats this for
[4:01:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> switch
[4:01:39] <mayorrev> girls only club?
[4:01:41] <%hussdogrob> I would be shocked if there weren't one for the remake (battle model for the dress )
[4:01:42] <%Keyd00d> SourPls
[4:01:44] <%THATGUY_789> pig tails are mainly used as grip handles.........takes sip*
[4:01:46] <SummonerMagno> Thunderhead
[4:01:48] <wookie5358> There wouldn't be a place to fit a battle, but battle models won't be needed in remake
[4:01:50] <Fathuran> *Portculis closing sounds*
[4:01:51] <Valdorick> May this scene survive the censor Purge
[4:01:53] <disflipmat> Why did Clumbo need a blonde wig instead of just...getting his hair styled?
[4:02:00] <xeros720> time to give Don Corneo the Clumbo Treatment, CBT for short
[4:02:01] <Fear_Ranjer> YO I bet you Remake will have skins you can swap through, and Cloud's crossdressing outfit will be one
[4:02:03] <ittla> fuck i love how this game sounds
[4:02:06] <Tennochief> @THATGUY_789 what else would they be used for?
[4:02:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> A proper sex dungeon
[4:02:12] <%OdysseyKnight> Look at the sex dungeon
[4:02:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @THATGUY_789 pigtails are popular amoung children. why don't you have a seat
[4:02:17] <KishinGrek> Fem-cloud in remake better confuse my penis
[4:02:19] <ittla> what an amazing shot with cloud at the top of those stairs
[4:02:19] <+Intolerable> THE FUCK DUNGEON

[4:17:36] <%arkv01> steal is such a blasé term, its the lawful appropriation materia

[4:17:54] <Tennochief> damn
[4:17:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> Mug is great
[4:18:01] <mankeyfigh> Aps is presumably named (and/or mistranslated) after Abzu, one of the primeval gods in the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Elis, and was made of fresh water. He was the lover of Tiamat, another primal deity that was made of salt water. Incidentally Tiamat is not officially in Final Fantasy VII, although Aps does have a buddy you'll meet much later in the game.
[4:18:01] <artoflec> Pat do you think Square Enix is/will be on a Capcom-esque redemption arc with FF7 happening and XIV killing it
[4:18:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is it time to get lost
[4:18:15] <%hussdogrob> When they release the complete set of the FF7 REMAKE I want it to be a case with an external hard drive in it cause the games too massive

[4:23:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @OwlLightningMage Agreed.
[4:23:21] <majindusto> X-2 is Still better than XIII
[4:23:27] <$joylent_blue> 13 is dramatically improved when you skip every single cutscene

[4:23:34] <+Grayhammatter> the bleagles
[4:23:35] <EuropantLamprey> Scoob and Shagg!

[4:24:39] <+jamsbybetty> It's TOO GOOD
[4:24:39] <wookie5358> 13-2 is a good time, but it's the first game that made me actively hate DLC with its atrocious DLC model on PS3
[4:24:39] <alrobot2014> what
[4:24:44] <TheBlankAce> What are you talking about, Beta exists
[4:24:45] <%sshen> ANIMAL

[4:24:53] <%Mekhet09> What are you talking about pat.
[4:24:55] <%nmaten> literally makes the milk turn sour if you do that
[4:25:04] <SchroedingersFerret> Curdled?
[4:25:05] <Louie_Salmon> So what I'm hearing from chat is that my goblin is too powerful
[4:25:05] <$joylent_blue> pat saying enemy skill is bad hurts my soul
[4:25:08] <GypsySquid> And you can use Beta to kill like pretty much everything in disc 1.

[4:25:51] <%Mornaka> There pretty similar nowadays
[4:25:51] <DocMadfox> Rap and Country are surprisingly similar
[4:25:53] <%moogleboy1984> Country music is rap for white people
[4:25:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't think legal fees are gonna be worth it
[4:25:58] <%THATGUY_789> haha
[4:25:59] <bear_breaker20> but rap and country are both degenerate
[4:26:00] <%rdark_ksu> @Deadpal the cynic in my thought that too.
[4:26:00] <%Mornaka> *they're
[4:26:00] <+Pajex_> dogs/dawgs

[4:26:07] <@JustinianKnight> DUDE
[4:26:08] <InugamiTheHound> country music sucks
[4:26:11] <lokiluko> the opposite or rap would be entirely instrumental no?
[4:26:16] <Tennochief> Country Music is good
[4:26:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Prepare yourself for Gackt Weapon
[4:26:19] <%ssjklyco> Replace country living with the hood life

[4:26:20] <alrobot2014> praise be to our lord and saviour GACKT
[4:26:24] <Applecannon63> I though Country music more like Jazz for southern

[4:28:45] <%jiin6> no one uses brain on twitter
[4:28:46] <InugamiTheHound> Paige is playing DS2 with a ps4 controller but all the buttons are xbox buttons
[4:28:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> Cait Sith
[4:28:47] <%Mornaka> not caith sith?
[4:28:48] <GypsySquid> Cait Sith's pretty weird.

[4:29:12] <%jiin6> Cait Sith is nothing but trash
[4:29:12] <%pwnjones> GODHAMS
[4:29:18] <+r_Foeburden87> Every game has a bad char, thsi one is Cait
[4:29:19] <InugamiTheHound> he had more lines than red 13 in advent children I think
[4:29:21] <+MisterRockett> Cait Sith is redeemed in FFXIV.
[4:29:28] <Valdorick> Cait Sith, more like Fuckface
[4:29:30] <wookie5358> He's okay for speed running. Otherwise, there's a reason his name is cat shit
[4:29:31] <ittla> cait sith is cool but he barely translates to the low poly style of ff7
[4:29:37] <ittla> his model looks like trash
[4:29:38] <majindusto> Even if the morrow is barren of promises, Nothing shall forestall my my Return - Genesis Rhapsodos
[4:29:39] <GypsySquid> Red had like one line in AC: "There are still children with the stigma."

[4:30:30] <InugamiTheHound> @GypsySquid he was voiced by Liam o Brien aka War from darksiders and Gaara from naruto.
[4:30:41] <%Mekhet09> Mekhet09 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! So this is a podcast question but what system made you hate a game. I hit post game ff10. To beat dark aeons you have get perfect stats and replace almost every sphere and relevel them all.
[4:30:43] <+Grayhammatter> dancer is good for buffs, machinist got that damage though
[4:30:47] <%jiin6> silly dad pat
[4:30:53] <GypsySquid> @InugamiTheHound That is correct.

[4:31:24] <InugamiTheHound> @GypsySquid it saddens me that AC voice cast won't get to voice them ff7 remake
[4:31:42] <%Scottigecko> @bear_breaker20 it's pretty great and nintendo games tend not to price drop. If you like trpg's can't go wrong with it
