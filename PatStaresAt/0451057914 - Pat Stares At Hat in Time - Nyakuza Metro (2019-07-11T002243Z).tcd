[0:16:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dogs use all their brain cells to sniff their buuuuuttts
[0:16:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Cat's probably don't even know their own names.
[0:16:25] <DocMadfox> I'm gonna be honest, even with more neurons in their brains, my dogs are dumber than any cats I ever had.
[0:16:26] <moosemonkey397> yeah but dogs wont leave you alone
[0:16:27] <+Promessa_EX> elephants have more than us, human's don't know brains
[0:16:27] <doctor_be> why would they need brains when they are cute? I mean look at how paige manages

[0:22:42] <NickHatesSnow> Ace Attorney and Dangganronpa are visual novels
[0:22:45] <Erictron4000> when was the last time you used your switch portable?
[0:22:46] <%GabeSweetMan> I miss Ace Attorney.
[0:22:48] <Sitromxe> 'Post-modern'. *Retching*

[0:23:25] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @AngriestPat Is Paige still around or has she returned to the Bone Pit from whence she came?
[0:23:34] <%GabeSweetMan> I just realized, I never liked Visual Novels or Adventure games, yet combine the two and some of my favorite games in the past ten years appear.
[0:23:36] <NeroInfinite> I couldn't show up for the FFXIV streams because Iwas still doing th ARR kumate

[0:23:38] <devanmuse> @NickHatesSnow to be fair, Danganronpa and Ace Attorney have a lot more of an interactive element to them in their trial stuff. Umineko is straight up just a novel
[0:23:42] <+brave_sj> But I want to see you boldly declare an anime schoolgirl as your waifu while Paige watches and shames you while pretending her skeleton thing isn't weirder

[0:56:27] <ashuckel> @AngriestPat how many hours would SB take skipping everything, need to catch up
[0:56:33] <%TeraMercier> @Kingtut9009 It's moderately simple, controls firmly and has surv-horror ammo conservation and inv management. Appeal comes in the ambiance and tensions, I can see it missing if you're not at the controls

[0:58:07] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What about playing the original FF14?

[1:02:59] <%GabeSweetMan> It's the WORST.
[1:03:03] <hyrulewarrior84> Hey Pat, new subscriber! Nice to see what you’re doing in realtime!
[1:03:03] <Axle13j> sounds rather specific
[1:03:03] <%averyoddjew> to avoid controller related bugs
[1:03:04] <%spiritofmojave> that's so goddamn weird

[1:04:00] <Copperama> I remember Pat on the Retsucast, I pretty sure he said DSP would outlive them all, and that was about 3 years ago I think?
[1:04:01] <%TaifuDragon> After it gives it to you

[2:33:06] <Tisaric> You could do Seal the Deal as well if you want
[2:33:07] <Mrbaconator> when is FF7
[2:33:10] <%Afterman_> samsho
[2:33:11] <Cameony> l o d s of e m o n e what's that spell? Loads of money! probably
[2:33:12] <Merkensteiner> SamSho, definitely
[2:33:12] <%TeraMercier> Play Doom arcade mode so you can skip the secret hunting
[2:33:13] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vargThomas maybe pat maybe
[2:33:14] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Do the Seal DLC
[2:33:17] <%skizzuto> there's still the seal the deal levels too

[2:33:35] <Tisaric> You're about halfway through this DLC
[2:33:38] <Solidus_113> gotta give the deathwish a try
[2:33:49] <Luvinsus> Higher
[2:33:56] <+Ace5335> now go up
[2:33:57] <Tisaric> Climb it now
[2:33:58] <%king_wragles> What's with the coin?
[2:33:59] <ミュウレ4242> could play another FF game along side it, as a sort of substitute. maybe jump on the 7 hype train.
[2:34:00] <%Niney_Who> Go up more
[2:34:04] <+Promessa_EX> that's a sonic 06 silver coin
[2:34:05] <%BioApple> the deathwish boss fights are kiwami as fuck
[2:34:09] <Tisaric> The coin is a deathwish thing
[2:34:11] <Manwad> a s c e n d
[2:34:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Other side
[2:34:17] <%Broand> Huh? did they add deathwish for nyakuza?
[2:34:21] <Bionicghost> dig up
[2:34:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I spent so much time watching Matt and Liam's Sonic 06 lp, that I got triggered when I saw that coin
[2:34:25] <Monkeyweed21> dig up stupid
[2:34:28] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat use the small metal bit sticking out the wallon the right end

[2:35:07] <$starotter70> "Did somebody turn off the lights!? I can't see shit!"
[2:35:07] <Tisaric> use a wall jump
[2:35:10] <%BioApple> a good general tip for exploration is to use the camera badge to scope out jumps
[2:35:31] <Solidus_113> one more
[2:35:34] <Solidus_113> yeeee
[2:35:34] <Cameony> better tip: Throw yourself at walls and get mad

[2:45:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat created Dead souls
[2:45:46] <NickHatesSnow> Nelo?
[2:45:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @dredshift Hypocrisy about what, specifically? I was not privy to this
[2:45:46] <%jiin6> Pat did dead souls
[2:45:47] <$starotter70> Own up to it coward
[2:45:48] <eco419> Yes you did
[2:45:52] <%spiritofmojave> someone has to take it, poor Dead Souls is dead
[2:45:52] <Analogflame> own it coward
[2:45:53] <Merkensteiner> Woolie did that
[2:45:55] <%ThatGuyfromMars> nope you gotta now
[2:45:56] <ミュウレ4242> dead souls is probably more expensive to actually buy than yakuza 0 at this point.
[2:45:58] <+mutavault666> he did say dead souls was good
[2:46:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> you invented yakuza
[2:46:00] <%spiritofmojave> Fall on the sword
[2:46:03] <krymzen5> IT WAS ALL U
[2:46:05] <Futurecity10> Pat your names on the bo
[2:46:07] <ClumzyDragon> pat is the one that made dead souls
[2:46:09] <Analogflame> u did it all coward
[2:46:13] <SaltyDongs> It's all your fault Pat
[2:46:13] <worldbrand> Pat discovered dark souls 5 thousand years ago
[2:46:17] <%jiin6> Here's all the credit for dead souls
[2:46:19] <%skizzuto> Pat made dead souls and only dead souls, got it
[2:46:21] <$starotter70> What about Black Panther?
[2:46:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> You're the reason we got yakuza on the wii u, pat
[2:46:29] <DXLelouch24> lets compromise, you invented Kamuro of The Dead
[2:46:34] <ventus_fury> @AngriestPat But Pat, Dead Souls has RE4 control scheme on the shooter bits
[2:46:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie Probably meant the crime punishment. Like the coke thing vs the Kenshin author
[2:46:39] <ミュウレ4242> hurry and invent those fuedal era yakuza games they never translated.
[2:46:40] <VritraReiRei> @angriestpat how about the creation of that mini game in Judgement? the team made that mini game SPECIFICALLY so you could be forced to play it
[2:46:42] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Did pat invent bloodstained
[2:46:43] <eco419> Dead soul is based on Pats real experiences on retail
[2:46:44] <%Solidnick18> oh boy

[2:58:09] <%Niney_Who> Nyakuza is huge. Seal the Deal's level is short
[2:58:10] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat are you planning on doing the "new threat" ff7 mod?

[3:00:53] <%snow_bush> Missed some back by the bounce bot
[3:01:13] <MasterDecoder> @StromkoPenguin Is that true? Cause I suck with Time and Distance
[3:01:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> be 1 short

[3:02:38] <StromkoPenguin> @masterde I phrased that very poorly I meant more that even geniuses will have a few bizarrely illogical opinions, nobody's immune to cognitive bias IE comparing FF7 to CT
[3:02:49] <%Niney_Who> 3
[3:02:49] <artificiallynatural> @AngriestPat would you consider playing any modded hat in time levels or are you done once nyakuza finishes

[3:08:48] <+Deano8817> Nanaki gang rise up
[3:08:49] <%Kataguro> Attaboy. Tifa and Barret would also be acceptable
[3:08:50] <DXLelouch24> use everyone but Cait Sith
[3:08:50] <$starotter70> That's correct
[3:08:54] <+Tyonidus> i wanted to go max out all my materia and stuff but it just takes...forever....
[3:08:56] <deviljhojho94> tomatoGrease heh
[3:08:59] <%ProtagonistJake> The same team everyone uses?
[3:09:04] <Ghost__Pantsu> No luv for shitsack FeelsBadMan
[3:09:10] <Huntercd> Best girl and dog good
[3:09:13] <IntrepidEye> Pat did you take credit for that SS JOJO shit yet?
[3:09:16] <%ProtagonistJake> I can’t talk shut that’s my team so far too
[3:09:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Tifa and Vincent for me
[3:09:16] <$cureneckbeard> Name Cloud, Tifa and Red "Pat", "Paige" and "Elmo" respectively
[3:09:18] <smugjorgen> No vincent?
[3:09:22] <Luesagna00> is there a mod to include the deleted stuff from ff7?
[3:09:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @shurtal that's not nice to call tifa a dog
[3:09:32] <%AbnormalVoid> fuck no lol
[3:09:32] <%ProtagonistJake> Once I unlock Yuffie might throw her in tho
[3:09:33] <%DonatelloJose> I thought Vincent and cid were good when I was a child
[3:09:34] <+Deano8817> Well it's the one I use
[3:09:35] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it is objectively the strongest team too
[3:09:36] <%jiin6> Yes
[3:09:36] <$starotter70> I use it
[3:09:38] <Crankthulhu> I thought it was Cloud, Tifa, Barret?
[3:09:38] <deviljhojho94> Tifa is hot and punchy and red is lovely
[3:09:39] <NickHatesSnow> I use yuffie not red
[3:09:40] <$shurtal> @Sphincter_Spelunker oh snap
[3:09:41] <DXLelouch24> i use everyone but Cait Sith, like i LITERALLY ignore his ass
[3:09:44] <%Broand> It's not the team I used because I haven't played it :>
[3:09:46] <Dio_TR> @angriestpat remember the layout of this level it's gonna come handy later
[3:09:53] <%king_wragles> Ye
[3:09:54] <Zebylth> tifa and yuffie for me
[3:09:55] <VirtuaRailith> I use Cloud, Cid, Yuffie
[3:09:56] <%AbnormalVoid> not really
[3:09:56] <NeroInfinite> ye
[3:10:00] <%Edgy_Macaroon> yuffie and tifa for me
[3:10:01] <deviljhojho94> its possible
[3:10:04] <justafoxhere> I used cid and yuffie
[3:10:04] <%D33TR> Cloud Tifa Cid
[3:10:05] <+Rolandknight> fuck red
[3:10:08] <%king_wragles> Okay chat, CHANGE MY MIND
[3:10:08] <+bestcup> Why isn't the stream titled "A Pat in Time"
[3:10:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like filling my party with babes, tbh. But I'd alternate teams
[3:10:10] <%AncelDeLambert> pfffft no
[3:10:13] <RupanSen> I think Cid is tronger
[3:10:16] <coreyferrell> Cid and yuffie i think is BiS
[3:10:18] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> They said the word "objectively" so that means it's true.
[3:10:18] <%AbnormalVoid> Red's final limit sucks
[3:10:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Yuffie has shittons of attack
[3:10:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuckin love Beat Rush
[3:10:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bestcup because pat has no sense of humor
[3:10:28] <+Scevda> Pretty sure their G's
[3:10:28] <qaaj> I used Cloud, Yuffie, Cid. Mostly for their leveling weapons but they just became really good.
[3:10:29] <%Kataguro> I want Tifa to crush me
[3:10:30] <justafoxhere> The objective strongest is Barrett and cid I think
[3:10:31] <%ProtagonistJake> Well Barrett with cover is busted cause of his defense
[3:10:34] <$El_Desperad0> Anyone who uses "objectively" like that are usually wrong
[3:10:37] <%SlugNut> SlugNut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! YEAH! Cmon Hat Pat dance! Also I hope you are well Pat.
[3:10:37] <VirtuaRailith> Highwind is like the 2nd strongest limit in the game
[3:10:39] <NickHatesSnow> cis has the besr single target attack
[3:10:42] <%Psyramics> not going through the fan?
[3:10:44] <smugjorgen> @Rolandknight please dont fuck the dog monster
[3:10:47] <ミュウレ4242> screw the entire naruto universe. yuffie best ninja.

[3:12:30] <a_mad_dragon> why is eric andre successful at the same shit tom green failed at
[3:12:35] <+zaworldo> Now kill her
[3:12:36] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Is this what it is like to own a cat?
[3:12:36] <+Deano8817> wait fuck we're here already?
[3:12:40] <Solidus_113> IT'S TIME
[3:12:40] <justafoxhere> I think all teams in ff7 could have an argument except for any that include Vincent
[3:12:42] <Solidus_113> FOR CRIME
[3:12:43] <+bestcup> @AngriestPat if you can' get onto hot ones, then be the new Sean Evans and make Woolie eat some crazy hot wings during the recording of Castle Super Beast
[3:12:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @a_mad_dragon delivery and being black

[3:12:56] <+Finchit> tom green failed?
[3:12:59] <nobknee> LUL
[3:13:05] <Dio_TR> he's black
[3:13:06] <+Scevda> Hes a Minority
[3:13:07] <Crankthulhu> Because Eric Andre is smarter, Tom Green was this low tier shitposter
[3:13:09] <%jiin6> Tom green was boring
[3:13:12] <%king_wragles> Who the fuck is Tom Green?
[3:13:14] <IntrepidEye> Actually being funny helps
[3:13:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Tom Green reached too far
[3:13:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Not humping corpses of dead animals certainly helps
[3:13:30] <+Finchit> yeah but freddy got fingered was great
[3:13:30] <TheZillex> Tom Green's movie was a masterpiece
[3:13:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @king_wragles he's the guy who made Freddie Got Fingered
[3:13:33] <nobknee> When Eric Andre gets to work with Rip Torn, then he will fall like our star Tom Green.
[3:13:35] <+Tokanova> eric andre kept being eric andre
[3:13:46] <+Andrizzleton> RIP Rip Torn
[3:13:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Andre built his base Tom Green over reached
[3:13:48] <%king_wragles> @AncelDeLambert follow up question: the fuck is that?
[3:13:50] <+KNYGHT87> BLARF
[3:13:50] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> time to google who the fuck tom green is
[3:13:50] <ミュウレ4242> king_wragles, he was a meme before the internet. then he became a target of the internet.
[3:13:50] <%cvp5127> lying helps

[3:14:17] <%AncelDeLambert> totally look it up, it's fucking stupid
[3:14:24] <implied_consent> I hear there's an artist by the name of Shadman that likes to make cute fanart of this game.
[3:14:27] <InkyDraconian> theres a theory somewhere online stating that eric andre is in hell
[3:14:28] <@lewdskeletor13> MORPHEUS DRINKING A 40 IN THE DEATH BASKET
[3:14:36] <ミュウレ4242> tom green goes to japan is up there on the asshole scale as well.
[3:14:39] <Solidus_113> AGH
[3:14:40] <Saltmeisterr> THE WAT?
[3:14:40] <Bionicghost> so bold yet so controversial
[3:14:41] <Monkeyweed21> what happened to Nathan for you?
[3:14:44] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat i can understand completely. because on roosterteeth gavin mentions Mister Bobbles that was similar but only had 1 season cuz ppl knew about it once it aired.
[3:14:45] <+PenmanLupine> is Pat talking about The Wire?
[3:14:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> heheh
[3:14:47] <%ProtagonistJake> @implied_consent you son of birch don’t say his name
[3:14:48] <$starotter70> @mayorrev bitch
[3:14:56] <dmtjinni> WHAT IT is CALLED????
[3:15:02] <artificiallynatural> @Monkeyweed21 it finished, and Nathan didn't want to do it anymore
[3:15:02] <nobknee> @AngriestPat Were you able to continue Nathan For You?
[3:15:07] <gotanysnacks> I remember that special, this is all true
[3:15:10] <%salty_syd913> WHAT
[3:15:11] <%Svanyr> Wait what
[3:15:11] <mayorrev> shredded nuts?
[3:15:12] <%ProtagonistJake> You’ll summon him

[3:15:12] <%king_wragles> WHAT?
[3:15:12] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, fuck that
[3:15:13] <+PenmanLupine> WHAT?
[3:15:14] <+Finchit> go in bruh
[3:15:15] <NeroInfinite> wooow
[3:15:16] <LeonSteel> WHAT
[3:15:17] <$starotter70> huh
[3:15:18] <%Kataguro> That last part is too much
[3:15:19] <%GarbageNirvana> If Tom Green came to prominence at the same time Adult Swim did he'd be set for life
[3:15:20] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Tom Green was something.
[3:15:25] <Snirtax> "The Tom Green Cancer Special"
[3:15:25] <+PenmanLupine> oh right. Tome Green!
[3:15:26] <implied_consent> There's an analytical video essay that makes the case for Tom Green's movie being a wok of meta genius.
[3:15:27] <+Deano8817> the WHAT
[3:15:27] <%spiritofmojave> quality comedy to someone I guess
[3:15:28] <gotanysnacks> Also a musical number at the end about feeling your balls so you don't get cancer
[3:15:29] <nobknee> LUL
[3:15:30] <+Qsmash_> I heard Tom and saw cats and thought Tom & Jerry
[3:15:31] <%ProtagonistJake> Tom was ahead of his time
[3:15:35] <artificiallynatural> the Tom Green what? Huh?
[3:15:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> She is printing fake money
[3:15:47] <+galactichype> Lmao zoomers
[3:15:49] <Solidus_113> JUMP IN THE MONEY
[3:15:50] <worldbrand> this WHOLE TIME i thought the tom green show and the red green show were the same thing
[3:15:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tom Green IS ball cancer
[3:15:53] <+Tyonidus> that's amazing in a way
[3:15:54] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Who the heck even is Tom Green?
[3:15:58] <ミュウレ4242> tom green also fought 4chan, personally. he arguably won. with no legal action.
[3:15:59] <+Tyonidus> also never heard of it somehow lol
[3:15:59] <+YandereGrandpa> but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
[3:16:00] <gotanysnacks> Didn't he go coffin shopping at one point?
[3:16:02] <+PenmanLupine> Drew Barrymore was there too cause they were dating at the time
[3:16:02] <%cherubs_anonymous> Eric Andre before Eric Andre
[3:16:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LiveStreamOnyx Old commedian
[3:16:06] <Huntercd> Oh no
[3:16:10] <faldin> oh the guy that jerked off a horse
[3:16:12] <Jack_of_No_Trades> money over 9k
[3:16:12] <TheZillex> All these darn kids not knowing who Tom Green is get off my lawn
[3:16:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> She prints fake money
[3:16:19] <nobknee> Would you watch Tom Green and Eric Andre "sword" fight?
[3:16:21] <+Anonymasque> I also think Tom Green's show drowned in reality show boom of the early 2000s. And Eric got more youtube social exposure.
[3:16:23] <+Deano8817> this will end well
[3:16:25] <%DireHamster> DireHamster subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:16:28] <Luesagna00> prolly made him feel better about losing one of his nuts

[3:51:19] <RC_S3kshun8> Why is this even an argument? Of course you can eat whatever the fuck you want
[3:51:23] <worldbrand> of course you can but it's not necessarily good for you
[3:51:24] <a_mad_dragon> i have more than two meats in a fucking sub sandwich
[3:51:25] <DocMadfox> ... Did you never have Kebobs?
[3:51:26] <lloyddboy> it's called a club sandwich

[3:51:42] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat yeah its called a fucking sandwich ...like? two meats
[3:51:45] <%AncelDeLambert> eggs are a meat
[3:51:45] <zamzoph> In Italy you get a platter full of different meat
[3:51:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Egg = protein = meat
[3:51:47] <+GiantsKnife> or anysandwich with more than 1 type of cold cut
[3:51:49] <Killhamski> I like to have a minimum of 3 animals per meal.
[3:51:50] <+Tokanova> Egg IS a meat
[3:51:50] <+Intolerable> EGGS ARE A MEAT
[3:51:50] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> By bringing up a BBQ, you destroyed the argument already
[3:51:51] <%KendallLitDinner> You can have any amount of meat you want if you're committed enough
[3:51:52] <%madogod> mr moneybag here with his more than 2 meat platter
