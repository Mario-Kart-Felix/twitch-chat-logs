[0:44:38] <%GameOverDeo> !uptime
[0:44:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 44m 40s.
[0:44:39] <%SubparSamaritan> Pat said my name naroGasm
[0:44:42] <%TheDullaMAN> No, let's talk more about Fate and less about lolis.
[0:44:43] <+camodikk> HBG KBG or Bow first?
[0:44:48] <OotsyMahDootsie> stay dandy, baby
[0:44:48] <+alphonseisbest> fate is trash, but fgo is alright
[0:44:49] <Sulliman34> longsword is a good starter weapon
[0:44:50] <%GameOverDeo> Is this a DSP prestream?
[0:44:53] <EVA_Unit02> Point at the Fate Wrestlemania sign!
[0:44:53] <ValidVenasaur> When are they gonna fix the online?
[0:44:53] <+joylent_blue> Broxxicon i switched to hammer after a while and NEVER looked back
[0:44:54] <CutCombo> I'm gonna tie you to a radiator. . .
[0:44:56] <$mandragoraroot> all weapons are good starting weapons
[0:44:59] <%Remery_> Sword ab
[0:44:59] <+StrangeCoincidence> What's wrong with Pat's beautiful face?
[0:45:01] <%lols_royce> hammer is fun
[0:45:09] <sjcodan> PC Runs better, but PS4 is more up to date
[0:45:11] <%Remery_> Sword and Shis is a good starter aeapon5
[0:45:11] <%ECRead> I tricked my friend into diving into Yakuza. Now he goes with all my recommendations. Got him on EVA now
[0:45:19] <+ShogunNoonto> @frustratedaf its a pat stream uts an IRL stream for like an hour
[0:45:22] <Trillex56> has pat shown session id yet or is it only for subs?
[0:45:33] <%simpo98> i love lance in this game love the charge move its so goofy :D @AngriestPat
[0:45:34] <Zeikier> I spent a lot of time with the hammer and greatsword, sometimes worried I specialize too much without trying others
[0:45:36] <%SilverFist91> 60 fps Mon Hun does sound sexy
[0:45:37] <+NWR_James> KEEP GOIN

[0:45:45] <Thalchampz> IT'S THE GAME PogChamp
[0:45:45] <%Remery_> You love it you slut
[0:45:47] <forevern2dust> @mandragoraroot I agree with this (except heavy gunbow)
[0:45:53] <wookie5358> 5 second load times instead of 5 minute load times as well
[0:45:55] <$Dutchpotato> Go back
[0:45:55] <%ECRead> a videogame? PogChamp
[0:45:59] <+Keansor> Aw fuck the real stream is over
[0:46:01] <+TeethMuncher> I didn't come here for games though
[0:46:04] <+Rinkimah> Can we talk about those 2-5 second loading screens too? stripGasm
[0:46:06] <@thenefftw> I've never played any games on PC so I'm fine with 30 fps
[0:46:06] <+SammyKiller> This already looks way better than my PS4 pro lol
[0:46:14] <+Tonku_the_Red> I forgot he was playing MHW. . .
[0:46:25] <+joylent_blue> oh male legiana set has a weird helm, i like it
[0:46:31] <%Remery_> This makes my PS4 look like a Gamecube :(
[0:46:33] <+SammyKiller> I kinda wanna get this game to play on PC now, would like to play on 4K.
[0:46:38] <%simpo98> 4 Star i sleep ResidentSleeper
[0:46:39] <+luketrapwalker> Is that a Gatchaman armor set?
[0:46:39] <BakedCheeseMan> You make that redbull look so goooood...
[0:46:46] <+keksisblyat> @angriestpat Reccomended settings for OBS for a mid tier computer?
[0:46:47] <Finakala> Legiana is the best
[0:46:54] <Thalchampz> goddamn
[0:46:55] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat I've been using nothing but the hunting bag pipes since I started on pc, and that isn't changing until capcom adds hutning bongo drums
[0:47:00] <+joylent_blue> bragging 😡
[0:47:01] <Thalchampz> dat capcom shill
[0:47:15] <+joylent_blue> legiana set looks dope as hell
[0:47:17] <$mandragoraroot> @SWindleFeD the bazel horn is a drum
[0:47:18] <+Rinkimah> But Odogaran set!
[0:47:22] <+luketrapwalker> Definitely reminds me of Gatchaman
[0:47:26] <Mattmandx1> Anjanath is also good for the fire resist. A lot of monsters use fire attacks
[0:47:26] <%Remery_> looks really good
[0:47:27] <sjcodan> DONT CRAFT LOW RANK ARMORS, SCRUBS
[0:47:28] <+ItsAGundamu> @SwindleFeD you cannot stop the DOOTS
[0:47:30] <sjcodan> JUST DONT GET HIT
[0:47:31] <+Tonku_the_Red> Legiana armor is good for low rank.
[0:47:35] <+SWindleFeD> @mandragoraroot how bongo like are we talking here?
[0:47:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The only reason this looks any different from ps4pro is he basically turned off the air
[0:47:45] <%GameOverDeo> Legiana set great for farming
[0:47:45] <%simpo98> Rathalos is also good
[0:47:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> good boy
[0:47:51] <Trillex56> @AngriestPat session only for subs or can anyone play wiytth you?
[0:47:51] <+SammyKiller> @sjcodan I agree, go straight to high rank and get good, get a real armor there.
[0:47:51] <$mandragoraroot> its more of a war drum
[0:47:51] <+Tonku_the_Red> And it looks cool.
[0:47:52] <+Debuggingfool> Is there a no helmet option?
[0:47:52] <Notsocleveruser> You gonna get that FF14 Dragoon set?
[0:47:57] <+joylent_blue> yes Debuggingfool
[0:48:00] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you play with charge blade?
[0:48:00] <%TheSniperJoe> HERESY!
[0:48:07] <Max_Capacity> but the great girros set looks rad AF
[0:48:07] <b1gboss007> @debuggingfool yes
[0:48:08] <%SimsarO> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, sorry for the no reply. I was in the middle of a hunt. I also didn't even hear what the follow up was either. XD
[0:48:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hunters horn?
[0:48:11] <@thenefftw> Have you played with Hunting Horn yet?
[0:48:13] <cerberuscarmine> kirin time!
[0:48:18] <+joylent_blue> fight Kirin you coward
[0:48:18] <Finakala> Charge Blade is fun
[0:48:23] <$mandragoraroot> do it SwiftRage
[0:48:24] <%simpo98> KIRIN Lets go
[0:48:30] <+Rinkimah> Lightning unicorn is the worst.
[0:48:31] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Did you see the G Arcade mode ending?
[0:48:31] <%simpo98> DO IT
[0:48:33] <+Debuggingfool> I just started with heavy bow gun and its pretty fun
[0:48:37] <Thalchampz> SnS PogChamp
[0:48:39] <ValidVenasaur> How do i get good at charge blade? last monster hunter i played was 3U
[0:48:39] <+KR_Black> Pat are you capable of mixing sets for bigger numbers or everything has to match ??
[0:48:39] <+RokettoOsuka> yo Pat you cheating... I mean grinding off screen yet
[0:48:41] <+SammyKiller> It's hard to start over when you are HR200+ :/
[0:48:46] <Aydarkzero> SnS 4 life
[0:48:48] <+SWindleFeD> hunting horn is fun, first I break a Jagras head and then I play a beat
[0:48:53] <@SSaryn> @AngriestPat Found a better version of my dumb bullshit, pinning in Hunting Chat as well.
[0:48:53] <sjcodan> KIRIN IS SUPER EASY
[0:48:53] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> HBG is fun
[0:48:54] <+TongVue> im lance all the way
[0:49:00] <@SSaryn> With no injector obviously.
[0:49:01] <cerberuscarmine> KIRIN IS NOT EASY
[0:49:01] <+Rinkimah> You can beat him with low rank stuff, but it's such a long fight it'
[0:49:04] <cerberuscarmine> YOU LIAR
[0:49:05] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:49:08] <sjcodan> I've carted like, 6 time TOTAL to Kirin
[0:49:08] <%Remery_> Bow shits on Kirin, dodge his lightning like a badass
[0:49:09] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Makes 20 FPS feel a bit better
[0:49:15] <dekkitout> kirin is easy...if you stack brace gems on urgaan set...
[0:49:16] <+SammyKiller> Kirin is freaking easy, probably easier than Vaal Arch tempered
[0:49:22] <Reanimator83> Fuck that fucking horse
[0:49:24] <keiji_maede> Lol.... what's better Rajang or kirin?
[0:49:30] <+Gregoryjk16> I just lame kirin out with my flame bow
[0:49:31] <forevern2dust> Kirin is easy when you use bow
[0:49:31] <sjcodan> Just use Dual Blades
[0:49:35] <%simpo98> you think thats bad i didnt even know there was a low rank quest for him until i beat Nergigante @AngriestPat
[0:49:37] <Finakala> Vaal is generally easy
[0:49:41] <keiji_maede> Pick pat! Rajang or Kirin
[0:49:41] <%HiroTSK5> No cross play I assume
[0:49:44] <Broxxicon> Why are most of the weapons left handed? Why are they using such a sinful dominant hand?
[0:49:45] <%Keyd00d> 3peats
[0:49:47] <Finakala> Fuck Kush though, asshole
[0:49:48] <cerberuscarmine> go you fools!
[0:49:51] <KaiserMario> Why would anybody like to hang out with YOU???
[0:49:55] <corn_on_fire> wonder how fast that'll fill up
[0:49:56] <ShreddingPixels> Nancy PogChamp
[0:50:00] <+SammyKiller> Nice, i'd totally join but eh.. buying the game again
[0:50:04] <gloriusUMU> Mancy?
[0:50:05] <@SSaryn> That's already gonna fill up like crazy.

[0:50:06] <dekkitout> "As in 'Mancy'!"
[0:50:07] <%SimsarO> @AngriestPat I'm already rolling with like... 6 people but I will later Pat! Have a good one, back to lurking.

[0:50:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you were on ps4 i could destroy these bitches with my new final fantasy armor and my cocytus
[0:50:26] <SkyHawkdousi> The sessions between ps4 and pc aren't connected right
[0:50:27] <+keksisblyat> @angriestpat Recommended settings for OBS for mid tier computer

[0:50:42] <pwnhills> I'm mad that these load times are nonexistant jesus christ
[0:50:48] <forevern2dust> It's so sad that has to drown the sorrow of his loss with monster hunter
[0:50:51] <+jkobe34> the low res textures really suck on pc

[0:51:19] <xeros720> god damn, my stream is loading all the fps thanks to those textures
[0:51:20] <%Remery_> How do you forget to eat? I'm always thinking about the next meal. :)
[0:51:23] <KaiserMario> Is this game "moddable" on pc?
[0:51:24] <+resstarr> 60 FPS vineNut
[0:51:25] <SatansDick1> why are you a dark souls character
[0:51:25] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Nothing in this game warrants the sub par performance tho
[0:51:26] <Makoiscutest> @SWindleFeD yeah, its not too bad thankfully
[0:51:30] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat do you need a minute to make your tongue obey you?
[0:51:32] <Divryne> Pat hungry for DICK.

[1:08:40] <Daniel_Is_I> I just wish this game wasn't so CPU-intensive. I can run so many better-looking games just fine but MHW chugs like a bitch.

[1:15:39] <xeros720> his desert carrots
[1:15:43] <$GohanEgret> weird way to say candy
[1:15:44] <+joylent_blue> the hammer requires special sharpening techniques
[1:15:44] <suddenlyscorched> If you don't sharpen a hammer it won't cut cleanly

[1:17:15] <forevern2dust> If there are 4 people all with hunting horns what would be the best way to optimize the buffs.
[1:17:15] <spiegspikel> Cut off his tail with that sharp-ass hammer!
[1:17:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> with a hbg'
[1:17:22] <EASrake> Have you ever seen a golf ball
[1:17:31] <element_of_loyalty> Golf is not a sport
[1:17:32] <%Remery_> @Prevot but she's in heat :)
[1:17:36] <Arek_1> Almost never go for Big Bang. R2, Triangle x4 is the way to go. Lv3 R2 (3 hits), Triangle x4 if you only have time for one combo.
[1:17:42] <QueequegTheater> How long until plague starts drawing Diablos-tan
[1:17:50] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I thought he already did
[1:18:12] <Finakala> I wish Diablos' attacks did that little damage on HR
[1:18:14] <%Remery_> I thought Plague drew the poison spitting dragon
[1:18:16] <element_of_loyalty> pissy eyed diablo
[1:18:17] <+joylent_blue> he's running away like a big coward
[1:18:18] <+RokettoOsuka> Plague still has not given us Val-Chan
[1:18:19] <QueequegTheater> yeah but doing it more
[1:18:24] <Prevot> when's plague drawing Khezu-chan tho
[1:18:28] <%Keyd00d> It did say that
[1:18:39] <%Keyd00d> You can eat
[1:18:42] <element_of_loyalty> DAT TAIL
[1:18:47] <+Sadira_snack_attack> you did
[1:18:48] <cerberuscarmine> great maccao is best girl
[1:18:52] <$nitronLVIII> eat your carrots
[1:18:54] <+NWR_James> more carrot candy
[1:18:57] <strangelee> Is there a reason no one is joining Pat in the hunt?
[1:18:58] <QueequegTheater> Does Plague do commissions? I would love some badass Lucatiel art from him
[1:18:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[1:19:07] <Djinnazz> Nice!
[1:19:08] <+joylent_blue> man i LOVE that sliding hammer attack
[1:19:12] <%crontin956> Wait why does Pat need a message saying he can eat?
[1:19:15] <element_of_loyalty> FALL OFF THE EGDE
[1:19:17] <spiegspikel> Why is everyone assuming that Plague would draw Scaley porn? I thought any kind of reptilians infuriated him.
[1:19:20] <%Keyd00d> It's SO good
[1:19:36] <Prevot> @spiegspikel isn't plague all in on the snek train?
[1:19:38] <QueequegTheater> clem
[1:19:38] <%Jesseon89> I thought hammer seemed really boring when I tried it before, but it looks actually fun
[1:19:50] <%Remery_> Yea first time doing it, I didn't think a hammer bro would turn into a Sonic Spinball
[1:19:53] <element_of_loyalty> RUN
[1:19:58] <$mandragoraroot> nice
[1:20:05] <+joylent_blue> hammer is all about using your environment, just smacking at a monter's legs does get boring if that's all you do
[1:20:07] <FuqBoiSlim> yikes!
[1:20:10] <Arek_1> @jesseon89 You don't even know. So much fun.
[1:20:18] <spiegspikel> @prevot He is, but all the scaleys in this are dragons.
[1:20:18] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[1:20:30] <HotelYamato> @strangelee It's his first time encountering the monster, so he has to do it solo. Just how the game is set up
[1:20:38] <element_of_loyalty> BEST
[1:20:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> so cool
[1:20:42] <Captain_Joe1911> pretty cool B-)
[1:20:52] <strangelee> You only have a solo lobby until you see the cutscene @HotelYamato
[1:20:53] <+joylent_blue> he doesn't have to do the whole fight alone, just up till the intro cutscene
[1:20:58] <%lols_royce> Thanks Capcom, Very Cool
[1:20:58] <element_of_loyalty> HYdrobot
[1:20:59] <Finakala> Palico is drawing so much aggro
[1:21:05] <garbageheaphound> that move is the best
[1:21:08] <faldin> get up on the hydra's back
[1:21:11] <Prevot> Pat is SO good at not hitting monsters PogChamp
[1:21:12] <+Grayhammatter> how did that actually miss?
[1:21:15] <%Remery_> Just spinballattack it
[1:21:16] <strangelee> No one is joining him, even though it's now open to all 4 slots
[1:21:18] <QueequegTheater> Anybody else watch Overlord? I just discovered it and binged season 1 today. It's so good
[1:21:20] <CappuccinoGuil> he's just doing 1 damage, tho
[1:21:24] <+joylent_blue> GET UP ON THE DIABLOS'S BACK
[1:21:29] <HotelYamato> @strangelee oh yea, that's how it works. Remembered him talking shit to the monster, so maybe just wants to solo it for the lulz?
[1:21:39] <%Jpdodds> REKT
[1:21:39] <Arek_1> Does MH:W on PC support DirectInput controllers (like the DS4)?
[1:21:39] <element_of_loyalty> ELMO HAS A SICK HORN
[1:21:40] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[1:21:44] <%lols_royce> good trade
[1:21:49] <%zer0_11> @QueequegTheater Yeee. good shit
[1:21:59] <strangelee> They don't need an invite, though. It should just be open at the quest board in the Hub
[1:22:02] <%Keyd00d> Elmo putting int he work
[1:22:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> jeez
[1:22:07] <QueequegTheater> @Arek_1 if the Xbone controller is one of those, then yes.
[1:22:10] <Finakala> Yeah it should be open to join now
[1:22:16] <QueequegTheater> Cocytus best girl
[1:22:17] <element_of_loyalty> stars
[1:22:18] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder how this would run on my Acer Predator Helios 300
[1:22:19] <CappuccinoGuil> chat, why was pat excited to be on Diablos' back when his attacks were doing just 1 damage?
[1:22:20] <%simpo98> i find regular Diablos way harder than Black Diablos @AngriestPat
[1:22:23] <%Remery_> @QueequegTheater fun watch
[1:22:23] <+joylent_blue> he stunner himself LUL
[1:22:24] <Finakala> Always worked that way when me and my squad friends were playing
[1:22:24] <element_of_loyalty> RIGHT IN THE ASS
[1:22:27] <%Keyd00d> right in the TAINT
[1:22:27] <+joylent_blue> stunned*
[1:22:28] <%GarbageNirvana> (j/k I have an Asus ROG Strix)
[1:22:32] <Arek_1> @queequegtheater Xbox One controller is XInput.
[1:22:32] <$mandragoraroot> i FELT that one
[1:22:36] <EASrake> it looks really fucking good
[1:22:37] <Prevot> MH is the king of hitstop
[1:22:40] <Ell1ot> did you sharpen the handle of your hammer?
[1:22:49] <%Agami23> switchaxe has it with the zero sum discharge
[1:22:53] <element_of_loyalty> meow
[1:22:56] <EmahsOrex> christ that diablos is taking a real hammering
[1:22:59] <+sayaman012341> @AngriestPat Does the PC release come with all the post-release content from the console version?
[1:23:01] <+joylent_blue> it needs to hurt when you grip it good
[1:23:02] <Ell1ot> this game is awesome
[1:23:04] <+Comrade_Vladof> Gotta scrape the monster bits of the hammer
[1:23:06] <QueequegTheater> @Remery_ how is the sub? I've been watching the dub, and fucking Maxwell from Hellsing Abridged plays Ainz.
[1:23:07] <Prevot> the LS hitstop when you hit multiple targets with the roudslash is sweet
[1:23:12] <EASrake> you MUST polish the shaft
[1:23:19] <element_of_loyalty> BOBOMB
[1:23:21] <$Dutchpotato> Bow has it with the power shot
[1:23:28] <sjcodan> Dualswords hitstop just looks like my framerate gets cut in half.

[1:23:57] <FrustratedAF> i can just use pitfall unstead of a shock trap and bombs?! DansGame i feel silly
[1:24:00] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat diablos look like magmar
[1:24:05] <Mattmandx1> @AngriestPat Have you tried turning the VA language to the Monster Hunter language?
[1:24:05] <+joylent_blue> my brain said trap, but my heart said bomb
[1:24:07] <$Dutchpotato> Time for best mission ResidentSleeper
[1:24:07] <Arek_1> @sayaman012341 Not the content but all the changes since release.
[1:24:08] <elvenwhiskey> monster hunter logic=your hammer is dull, better sharpen it
[1:24:10] <element_of_loyalty> PA U SO STRONG
[1:24:10] <%lols_royce> that texture wasnt designed for 60fps
[1:24:11] <+dougrayman> hey pat, how you doing?
[1:24:12] <chrishansen69_> Yeah.. if pat can.. then it proves darwin wrong and he must have been chosen by god
[1:24:15] <xeros720> i forget the HR right now, but he's low rank, working on getting to zorah magdaros
[1:24:16] <Captain_Joe1911> hello @TheRageofAfrica :)
[1:24:17] <%lunar_decay> are the servers still shit?
[1:24:19] <Finakala> Yeah pitfall and shock both work for captures
[1:24:19] <%Remery_> @QueequegTheater it's enjoyable, Dub feels weird like i pay less attention to it because i dont have to read
[1:24:23] <dekkitout> "Conquered the ecosystem", don't worry about the ecosystem altering mythical beasts though...
[1:24:35] <KaiserMario> I get a little annoyed when people complain about texture quality of a game like this... I mean, have you played a DS MH???
[1:24:39] <CappuccinoGuil> tell her chat says hi!
[1:24:44] <%Remery_> Text her winky face chicks love winky face

[1:31:05] <+Sadira_snack_attack> yeah, that was my first question about that ship
[1:31:05] <QueequegTheater> @ECRead but Lucatiel is cooler
[1:31:06] <element_of_loyalty> HAH ELMO
[1:31:07] <Innocuous_Goat> They've been here a while
[1:31:08] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat a boat with bone "that's basically lead" also should sink
[1:31:09] <+Comrade_Vladof> That just means they haven't come up with anything better than big spear
[1:31:10] <willjar313> So, what was the plan again? Send a bunch'a schmucks on a cobbled together piece of shit against a goddamned Kaiju and hope it dies of laughter?
[1:31:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> wouldn't the shock of firing the dragonator rip the boat in half?
[1:31:11] <Mattmandx1> Dragonators are actually from the old civilization that are found and refurbished
[1:31:11] <+NWR_James> it could still be the latest. Maybe anti-elder dragon tech has stagnated
[1:31:12] <elvenwhiskey> dragonator has to be the worst name for anything ever
[1:31:14] <+joylent_blue> i'd call the commander daddy anyday
[1:31:14] <cerberuscarmine> its for new comers pat they dont know what it is
[1:31:18] <+d00msdaydan> it's really big tho, plus it spins
[1:31:19] <+anar_bael> There have been few new ways to hurt elder dragons other than a giant metal tipped stick
[1:31:25] <%Remery_> What type is his armor?
[1:31:26] <ImmaCanuck> *grunts*
[1:31:26] <+mar2503> also isnt the demolisher newer than it?
[1:31:28] <chrishansen69_> If pat learned how to utilize crazy talk.. he could turn the world into whatever he wanted it to.
[1:31:31] <QueequegTheater> AND SO HAVE I
[1:31:33] <element_of_loyalty> MOOVE OUUUT
[1:31:35] <sjcodan> @anar_bael There's really not
[1:31:35] <faldin> the lip sync is tied to the fake mh language, not any other language
[1:31:38] <DeadBlu3ey3z> magic Godzilla arrows
[1:31:39] <%ECRead> @QueequegTheater no doubt.
[1:31:43] <@thenefftw> IT'S FINE
[1:31:55] <+Sadira_snack_attack> the palico looks like a raving mad man with that mask
[1:31:56] <%CJett92> ITS FINE
[1:31:58] <TheRageofAfrica> To be fair they have been fighting everything with giant metal sticks

[1:32:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> For voicing half the game
[1:32:17] <KaiserMario> CAPCOM writing team

[1:34:00] <$Rumbutt> Fade slash is also the best way to start your spirit combo, cuts out the first hit of the string
[1:34:01] <%MaiHusbando9S> just keep taking those loads right in the face
[1:34:02] <Brutal_Defeat> Should’ve gone one of lances I guess

[1:35:04] <+ChrisLoven> I laughed very hard watching your story (again) about how you shit a candy bar
[1:35:12] <$mandragoraroot> someone tell pat he can loop O and Triangle attack
[1:35:20] <element_of_loyalty> Bobby Orr
[1:35:30] <sjcodan> I'm gonna go take a nap, I'll be back by the time he kills this
[1:35:30] <DeadBlu3ey3z> lmao
[1:35:37] <xeros720> i think killing the cores lowers hp for the next phase, it's kind of hard to say either way with how the fight is set up
[1:35:43] <%PatNTheHat> It's only magma when it's below the surface of the Earth, when it's above ground it's an asteroid
[1:35:49] <%Jesseon89> LUL
[1:35:54] <+joylent_blue> why does that not hurt you LUL

[1:36:13] <%ECRead> TINY NET
[1:36:13] <Reanimator83> What’s the best Long Sword
[1:36:14] <element_of_loyalty> 130,000 thousand tons.
[1:36:14] <+SenorCounter> It's good rope
[1:36:15] <Arek_1> @patnthehat Why even make that distinction?
[1:36:15] <EnderGamma> Sojiro sounds angry
[1:36:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big rope tho
[1:36:19] <+adavis72> Its real strong rope though
[1:36:19] <DeadBlu3ey3z> ROPE
[1:36:19] <miodrag9> It's 5 am here in sweden, just got off from a night shift of burger flipping.
[1:36:20] <Aydarkzero> this plan will work!
[1:36:21] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It's the only chance we have
[1:36:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> megalodon is a shark
[1:36:30] <%TheGershon> @KaiserMario closer to RE2Make's release he said
[1:36:30] <%mister___doctor> More like Bore-ah Magdaros
[1:36:31] <isnotboombox> To be fair if ants started shooting ropes and shit at me Id be confused to hell and back
[1:36:32] <QueequegTheater> It's the rope Rusty uses to beat his wives
[1:36:34] <+joylent_blue> oh boy here we go
[1:36:34] <%Piemen99> Monkeys vs a dragon
[1:36:35] <element_of_loyalty> TWEEK THE NIP
[1:36:35] <+anar_bael> 130,000 tones of burning rock vs a rope
[1:36:37] <ancrest_tant> You can rope anything with the right rope
[1:36:37] <spiegspikel> Sounds like a solid enough plan.
[1:36:38] <suddenlyscorched> They're hunters, with special Hunter's Ropes
[1:36:39] <xeros720> it's anti-dragon rope, dragons hate it
[1:36:39] <+SenorCounter> like 50cent a foot at Lowes
[1:36:45] <TheRageofAfrica> the plan will work, we have the dragonator
[1:36:46] <KaiserMario> @TheGershon BOOOOOO
[1:36:47] <Djinnazz> Tickle thst Nipple.

[1:37:11] <+SenorCounter> he stopped cause of the rope
[1:37:12] <Arek_1> @patnthehat Err, I thought you meant magma below ground, lava above ground.
[1:37:13] <stratfel112> You don't have any ranged weapons?
[1:37:14] <%Jpdodds> Thats not how Foresight Slash works
[1:37:25] <DeadBlu3ey3z> did the rope work
[1:37:25] <%CJett92> It's the monster that makes Woolie uncomfortable!
[1:37:29] <TheRageofAfrica> just eating the biggest shit sandwich this run eh?
[1:37:34] <+joylent_blue> i love that you can just completely ignore nerg

[1:37:41] <epylepticpanda> Hey Pat, when's Paige gonna finish Portal? And when are u doing RE2 Claire?
[1:37:42] <President_valentine> zora fucking sucks
[1:37:44] <dekkitout> why does it make wollie uncomfortable?
[1:37:54] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean it's only time sensitive if you're trying to get all the extra break parts
[1:37:54] <%Piemen99> 1-8
[1:37:57] <Mnightshyamallama> can't you literally completely ignore nergigante and it be completely fine?
[1:38:01] <TofuNyan> @AngriestPat how did you get the PS4 buttons? Assuming this is on PC
[1:38:02] <startstoprepeat> nerg drops extra zorah rewards if you do enough damaga.
[1:38:02] <TheRageofAfrica> almost pat
[1:38:02] <Finakala> Yup

[1:38:30] <+unfoldingchoas> I hope Pat play more Warframe. Doesn't he not know he is missing out on getting 75% Plat off lol
[1:38:32] <%Dr_DangerPhD> High stakes stalagmite slashing action
[1:38:36] <AnEnemyStandu> is pat using the button prompt mod for ps buttons or did hes just auto switch
[1:38:37] <+Thorn14> you got squished

[1:38:43] <pwnhills> Whu happen
[1:38:50] <%PatNTheHat> @Arek_1 Yeah, the gag I was going for was that lava/magma and meteor/asteroid are both pairs of words with completely meaningless distinctions
[1:38:51] <+joylent_blue> oh man i love the environment interrupting my farming
[1:38:53] <strangelee> Monch on it

[1:39:07] <cerberuscarmine> nom noms forever
[1:39:09] <isnotboombox> He's gonna sexually harrass Magdoros so hard
[1:39:09] <+joylent_blue> the wall got too close to pat's ass so the game teleported him
[1:39:12] <+anar_bael> the only thing I can think of is burrow into him
[1:39:13] <DraxTD> common @AngriestPat it's ALL riding on youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu =P
[1:39:15] <$mandragoraroot> i cant believe he ate the whole thing
[1:39:17] <oruandrew> no eat it tho
[1:39:19] <Zeikier> every elder dragon is a personal pan pizza if you try hard and believe in yourself
[1:39:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Don't think about it
[1:39:22] <oruandrew> just nom
[1:39:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nergigante would just be a cookie cutter shark on a whale

[1:39:29] <Mattmandx1> Lao Shan Lung is even bigger but he was scared of Fatalis wasn't he?
[1:39:29] <isnotboombox> He does have a sick ass theme though
[1:39:32] <deviljhojho94> its el pregnante

[1:39:36] <Aydarkzero> fight him and junkj
[1:39:37] <+Thorn14> yeah but Fatalis could breath fire
[1:39:37] <strangelee> Essentially, it's already supposed to be dying. That's why it's here in the New World.
[1:39:42] <+dodge_and_dust> maybe he will be like a caterpillar and crawl into his ear and eat his brain?
[1:39:43] <Arek_1> @dr_dangerphd @patnthehat Ah, I didn't really notice meteor/asteroid.
[1:39:48] <+Thorn14> nergigante is just...angry spike monster

[1:42:36] <element_of_loyalty> nope
[1:42:41] <+Grayhammatter> what the heck was that?
[1:42:42] <strangelee> It's the last part of the story, before the introduction of the Elder's Recess, I believe. Zorah Magdaros comes here to die. You chase it to do so into open waters. @TheRageofAfrica

[1:43:06] <element_of_loyalty> PAT THE LIAR
[1:43:06] <QueequegTheater> THE ALL IS LOST MOMENT
[1:43:07] <Zeikier> failed to scratch his back
[1:43:12] <Mrthepastyrider> Gojira
[1:43:13] <%Jesseon89> I usually spend this section on the boat.
[1:43:17] <strangelee> It should be the end of this quest, actually
[1:43:20] <+anar_bael> Time to give him his iron supplements
[1:43:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> ELMO NO
[1:43:21] <Finakala> Yeah your Palico will help load
[1:43:21] <+Comrade_Vladof> You're confident in the easiest thing in the entire game, wow

[1:43:36] <+Grayhammatter> elmo a good boy
[1:43:37] <TheRageofAfrica> @strangelee So you dont even kill it, you just change where he decided to die of old age
[1:43:39] <+Ilpala271> that's a lot of balls to fit in there
[1:43:43] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Wait how
[1:43:45] <strangelee> yea
[1:43:48] <Arek_1> When he headbutts, jump on his head. Smashing the head core nets you more chances for gem.
[1:43:50] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> How did the cannons do that
[1:43:52] <ha2ken> Hey...shoot Elmo out of the cannon....
[1:43:55] <+joylent_blue> that cat is strong

[1:44:20] <+polysyllabist> Those cannons make no sense!!!
[1:44:24] <Finakala> This whole segment is so goddamn boring
[1:44:35] <sjcodan> Cinematic
[1:44:36] <Prevot> NPCs aren't smart enough to fire their own cannons LUL
[1:44:40] <suddenlyscorched> I think this bastion's fucked
[1:44:42] <strangelee> Jump on it @AngriestPat
[1:44:45] <+joylent_blue> i love it when the NPCs do the work for me
[1:44:49] <+Comrade_Vladof> Elmo is doing a good shoot

[1:46:47] <Djinnazz> "Oh God my kidney!"
[1:46:51] <Brutal_Defeat> He is good at this part of the quest folks
[1:47:01] <Finakala> It's a lot more satisfying to fire the twin Dragonators in the Arena right into a Diablos' fac
[1:47:16] <element_of_loyalty> :iss off Ridley

[1:56:24] <%Jpdodds> Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the Void called to me.

[1:56:43] <QueequegTheater> quick everybody Hek!post
[1:56:43] <%Jpdodds> It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day?

[1:56:59] <+ScatFace> @AngriestPat would you use a save editor is they released one on this version?
[1:57:00] <%Jpdodds> Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key.
[1:57:00] <element_of_loyalty> CURSED
[1:57:01] <cholongkh> cursed commercials is pretty great

[1:57:10] <+Grayhammatter> curse commercials are the worst
[1:57:10] <%Jpdodds> It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.

[2:14:33] <Zeikier> find the dragon butt
[2:14:35] <+Bouerd> This would make a rad monhun area
[2:14:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if im honest i prefer the old efffects
[2:14:37] <MyNameIsRasus> I actually enjoyed DSR cause I never got to play original DS

[2:20:04] <+G_Thunders> As long as it has bloodborne’s movement
[2:20:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Bloodborne is still the best Souls Game, Plague be damned
[2:20:09] <dekkitout> its like the final act of revenge of the sith up in here
[2:20:10] <%PatNTheHat> I don't really want another Dark Souls game tbh
[2:20:11] <deviljhojho94> Pls play nioh del Boivino
[2:20:13] <+Ciphris> isn't that the only place those show up
[2:20:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> nioh is great, it just isnt explorative at a

[2:20:34] <@SSaryn> Testing the PS4 Prompts with non-injected and injected prompts and oh boi, both make my game stutter and that's not fun.
[2:20:34] <%TheDullaMAN> It's Dark Souls/Warframe in glorious Nipon
[2:20:40] <%BioApple> nioh is good but it is poison for the completionist in me
[2:20:43] <%HiroTSK5> Don't you love Loot Pat?
[2:20:47] <+Grayhammatter> nioh's good though

[2:21:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Are guys doing a video on Code Vein when it comes out?
[2:21:52] <deviljhojho94> BREAK THIS GAME APART

[2:25:25] <$SGrim> tpRWBYruby
[2:25:29] <$ookiiapple> its u
[2:25:31] <element_of_loyalty> Pats baby eyes are too small
[2:25:32] <%PatNTheHat> I've been playing for roughly 5 years now and I'm still only Mastery Rank 13 hehe
[2:25:32] <dekkitout> he's just covered in coagulated blood, he's not black
[2:25:32] <%Ferakin> That can't be true, Pat's voice isn't that annoying
[2:25:37] <grayjammer> You pointed it out to Woolie, you dummy!!!
[2:25:39] <deviljhojho94> Ewww
[2:25:45] <smellmycowbro> CANNOT UNSEE
[2:25:46] <+tegas_> 30 FPS locked ankles.
[2:25:48] <MyNameIsRasus> I couldn't take it, couldn't stand another minute
[2:25:51] <SirSaki> @fruit_pie_the_magician I've seen it and damn it looks fiiiine! Gonna be making Marage Prime soon enough. She's got it all!
[2:25:52] <Gorgen> Reused boss time
[2:25:52] <wookie5358> So they're... Leg disabled? @AngriestPat
[2:25:56] <%QueequegTheater> Scratch that: he's Weiss. Think about it, tiny angry animu girl who uses money as her greatest weapon
[2:25:58] <%SuperCasualBoom> I feel like those fire spewers are basically Smash players in Dark Souls
[2:26:02] <%Ferakin> He DOES have a suspicious lack of character development though
[2:26:03] <%PatNTheHat> Back in my day, you had to equip your abilities!
[2:26:04] <$ookiiapple> i cant believe youve done this
[2:26:08] <element_of_loyalty> Mr. president?
[2:26:09] <deviljhojho94> fatto demono
[2:26:14] <+TastySammiches> why do the effects still look like garbage in this remaster
[2:26:17] <%SaltyDongs> Tear up them guts
[2:26:18] <Gorgen> THICC
[2:26:25] <Mattmandx1> Fun fact: This bosses attacks are considered sorcery rather than fire even though it's clearly fire
[2:26:26] <+sayaman012341> Did someone say easy asylum demon?
[2:26:28] <element_of_loyalty> EROCK
[2:26:28] <glass_marcus> Literally took 3 stamina bars of attacks to kill
[2:26:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the mag deluxe is almost as good, but the phryke skin adds effects to nidus' powers
[2:26:39] <MyNameIsRasus> CAN'T ESCAPE FROM DEMON GAPE
[2:26:46] <strangelee> Why don't you read it @AngriestPat
[2:26:46] <%QueequegTheater> >using a frame that isn't Umbra
[2:26:48] <SirSaki> That boss got the booty
[2:26:55] <grayjammer> Good job, Scythe
[2:27:04] <Gorgen> new Vauban skin is badass but its a shame hes such a weak frame
[2:27:07] <%TheDullaMAN> Fuck you, Quee, I like my Inaros!
[2:27:08] <Willfordbrimly> How Pat do? Pat get huge?
[2:27:08] <%xemnahort> I didn’t know this boss was used a third time
[2:27:10] <%QueequegTheater> When did Ruby let herself go
[2:27:11] <dekkitout> that one nidus skin reminds me of an eva design from an ova i seem to have purged from my memory
[2:27:13] <SirSaki> I haven't done the second dream yet even @QueequegTheater I'm getting there!
[2:27:15] <+magusdraco> if you think the running is bad, female characters swap back to the male rig and have their knees rotate when they stop moving for like...a second or two
[2:27:16] <%BioApple> inaros is best boy

[2:27:59] <prismaticsnake> because you are
[2:28:00] <%PatNTheHat> Limbo is actually the best frame, but you'd need a pretty high IQ to understand the complexities of his playstyle

[2:32:03] <Gorgen> I cant believe Pat died to Pinwheel
[2:32:03] <Vorsun> Just an observer
[2:32:03] <+Bupkis7> Yeah sure. anytime you want
[2:32:09] <psychic117> Crazy talk is some real shit
[2:32:11] <strangelee> @QueequegTheater because it's just Mirrah Armor, and the sword was a personification of the Curse, a theme heavily used in her story in 2
[2:32:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat, tip for this boss, there's an area to the right of the fog gate where you can find it and not mind the lava
[2:32:14] <%Orphen_Griever> heh I allmost allways forget this boss exists
[2:32:14] <%QueequegTheater> @SatansDick1 what do you think Pat Stares At is for?
[2:32:18] <epylepticpanda> Pat's stand is OP
[2:32:19] <%SaltyDongs> His peekaboo style is to much
[2:32:23] <NonAddictiveSlurm> i cant believe Pat lost to Glass Joe

[2:32:39] <strangelee> @QueequegTheater not everything is a 1 to 1 coralation in those games
[2:32:40] <%QueequegTheater> @strangelee It is explicitly her armor. No one else wears it, and it is VERY explicitly her sword.

[2:36:58] <brosephmike> ctrl + C
[2:36:58] <%QueequegTheater> @strangelee "A Hollow once fought valiantly with this mask, but feared the fading of her self, and implored a comrade remember her name. Perhaps that is why this gentleman's mask is named after a woman." It's literally her gear
[2:36:59] <+magusdraco> @AngriestPat god remember when the dragon butts had a large aggro radius.
[2:37:02] <$SGrim> Ctrl C, Ctrl V enemies rooGasm

[2:37:29] <%THATGUY_789> since pat pointed out those ankles i cant but help notice how stupid it looks
[2:37:29] <NonAddictiveSlurm> they literally place enemies like its Mario Maker
[2:37:30] <%Everpresent_Overseer> But they went out of their way to model each dragon ass to slightly different

[2:39:13] <%SplatterAte> @xemnahort I couldn't remember till he agroed thx
[2:39:13] <%TheDullaMAN> Explanations are convuluted
[2:39:18] <%BioApple> "Time is convoluted" in DS1 was literally only there to explain co-op. It was never actually lore
[2:39:20] <dsauce999> Well I mean...convoluted
[2:39:24] <+AMUSERNAME> LUL HE GOT IT
[2:39:27] <%Ferakin> Izalith was an ancient Egyptian pyramid all along
[2:39:29] <+G_Thunders> It was cool until it meant “it’s vague on purpose”
[2:39:32] <$BoSteed> Those ankles are seriously bothering me now that it's been pointed out. D:
[2:39:32] <%xemnahort> You failed to beat ass so you just ate ass
[2:39:32] <Bobato_Chaps> NotLikeThis
[2:39:32] <%mister___doctor> Wesker isnt teleporting, time is just convoluted
[2:39:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol

[2:39:47] <%Everpresent_Overseer> He did it
[2:39:50] <glass_marcus> well that worked
[2:39:51] <Dapper_Cactuar> why did they think undead dragon butts were a good enemy idea?
[2:39:53] <%DedlokPM> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE! apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:39:54] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[2:39:54] <@SSaryn> Man that's dumb.
[2:39:58] <MyNameIsRasus> time is just convoluted in the biocurse
[2:39:58] <%altairibnlaahad909> bow and arrow all day long
[2:39:59] <dsauce999> GOOD CHOICE
[2:40:03] <AncelDeLambert> wah wah waaaaaaaah
[2:40:07] <+Granite_TV> it really does feel like an 8 year old was given the game editor for this level.
[2:40:08] <%QueequegTheater> "Deadline is almost there, fuck it, let's rip off Angkor Wat" Miyazaki, probably
[2:40:08] <+magusdraco> @AngriestPat well that and throwing the fucking moonlight butterfly shield at them with a powerful right hand weapon so it did like 1500 damage
[2:40:09] <Gehtingsberg> Nice job
[2:40:10] <TheRageofAfrica> Thats some weird hitboxes
[2:40:12] <%s_xylocalsingles> strong choice Father Patrick
[2:40:13] <+TsunamiPoro> oh no its the bad area
[2:40:14] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[2:40:18] <$SGrim> @Dapper_Cactuar ran out of time and budget and already had the model from Ariamis. rooSHrug
[2:40:24] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @anceldelambert is that why you can see below the world in the temple proper
[2:40:25] <%xemnahort> Ass eating ass?
[2:40:26] <%altairibnlaahad909> the 2nd half of Dark souls 1 is overall a much much weaker game than the first half
[2:40:28] <$SGrim> rooShrug FUCK
[2:40:29] <+Grayhammatter> it's like you have bananas for feet
[2:40:35] <%PatNTheHat> Real asses eat Pat
[2:40:40] <undeuxtroisqua> does pat's feet touch the ground when sitting on that couch?
[2:40:41] <TheButtravage> @AngriestPat You are still using the Great Scythe?
[2:40:41] <AncelDeLambert> they're cooking the planet, yes
[2:40:42] <wookie5358> It's like he's leg disabled
[2:40:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> I keep think Pat wants to fight Dragon’s Assholes
[2:40:47] <@SSaryn> apatCrazyhand
[2:40:49] <Bobato_Chaps> the game is already done
[2:40:51] <Pikshade> fuckin nailed it dude
[2:40:55] <Rosy_Joan> bed of chaos or as some people say, the best fight in this game Kappa
[2:40:56] <+magusdraco> bed of chaos: scum it out with arrows and quiting and reloading
[2:40:58] <%Keansor> Nice one pat, really bringing your C game!

[2:41:04] <%xemnahort> Welp crazy talk means he’ll never beat bed of chaos today
[2:41:06] <dsauce999> FILLING THE DARK AOUL WITH LIGHT
[2:41:07] <+TMulharin> Bed of Chaos is laughable if you do the firebomb cheese LUL
[2:41:23] <Sloavon> mmm cheese pizza
[2:41:24] <+CallMeTheBaus> boy watching this with Flux on is a time
[2:41:29] <deviljhojho94> bukOhh
[2:41:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can kill bed of chaos in like two minutes with a pair of firebombs with no problems at all

[2:42:00] <%Dingus_Tickler> Hollowed Ginger MUST WATCH
[2:42:01] <%QueequegTheater> @b0neh34d you need to get rid of the space
[2:42:01] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Pat is just a booty magnet
[2:42:03] <Brainworm205> Is you
[2:42:04] <undeuxtroisqua> take off your armor, you make less noise and you agro less, besides running faster of course

[2:42:23] <mr_slaide> I am late... Pat stopped playing MH?
[2:42:25] <%PatNTheHat> My favorite part of the Smash 4 shit is that the 16 and 17 year old Bayo mains are/were getting death threats
[2:42:29] <AncelDeLambert> eyyyy, noice
[2:42:30] <%b0neh34d> cheer350 I messed up my cheer the first time! So I will say it again.... PAT! HAVE MY BITS! Also hello!
[2:42:30] <%altairibnlaahad909> bed of chaos is by far the worst boss in all the souls games
[2:42:37] <%Press_X_ToJASON> honestly, with pat's build, he's basically playing a bayo mirror match
[2:42:42] <prismaticsnake> play music over every Bed attempt like Jerma did LUL
[2:42:48] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @patnthehat and that was before Evo Kappa
[2:42:52] <fairore> @patnthehat yeah that's fucking awful
[2:42:56] <mr_slaide> Did Pat play monster hunter?
[2:42:58] <AncelDeLambert> well, bed is certainly the worst conceived
[2:42:59] <%QueequegTheater> why don't we try gitting gud
[2:43:00] <dsauce999> Bayo is bad because I can't cope tho
[2:43:02] <Jolly_Adventurer> I'm guessing Pat doesn't know about the quick kill strat?
[2:43:08] <%xemnahort> How do giant decaying ass even see you?
[2:43:10] <Bobato_Chaps> oh hell yeah play classical music and shit
[2:43:15] <Sloavon> why hasn't paige streamed in a while?
[2:43:21] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Bayo is bad because she does combos in a fighting game
[2:43:21] <mr_slaide> Paige is dead.
[2:43:26] <AncelDeLambert> Paige is busy af
[2:43:28] <%Dingus_Tickler> Paige is in the hospital

[2:43:33] <%HiroTSK5> Is it just my internet or has anyone else had any trouble since Pat switch to Dark Souls?
[2:43:37] <%Dingus_Tickler> Emergency Mustard IVs
[2:43:40] <mr_slaide> She probably died.
[2:43:44] <element_of_loyalty> GET DEM BERRIES
[2:43:54] <NonAddictiveSlurm> no one complained when Anarchy reigns put her in and its arguably worse there
[2:43:54] <fairore> lugi fucking dead!!
[2:43:54] <%TheDullaMAN> Paige is farming Diabolos for Pat

[2:46:24] <%Dingus_Tickler> Pat is done playing Monster Hunter tonight

[2:46:53] <%TheDullaMAN> Damnit Paige, don't put the PeePee in clothes!

[2:47:27] <%Ferakin> I can't believe Pat just killed the first Old One

[2:50:58] <Basch71> you were supposed to have talked to him after the centipede
[2:51:02] <%Fairy_princess77> DIdnt you just say that you killed Solaire and Sigmaeyer?
[2:51:04] <%NovaKnightmare> Good job IDIOT, you just saved the best character
[2:51:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat you didnt talk to him in anor londo
[2:51:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> Solaire peaced out after arriving to the East Coast and seeing all the bad pizza on the street

[2:51:59] <prismaticsnake> timer for Slider
[2:51:59] <%Ferakin> Welp, thats the only worthwhile part of Izalith gone
[2:51:59] <%altairibnlaahad909> too bad they didnt fix the rest of this shit-ass area

[2:52:18] <DraxTD> *plays the sonic music*
[2:52:19] <+AXL808> why is there a big dumb slide anyway?
[2:52:21] <DSD24> The best part of the boss is this slidee
[2:52:21] <+ducethegamer> best boss fight incoming
[2:52:21] <%QueequegTheater> is that Liam
[2:52:21] <+magusdraco> PAT LAME IT OUT, DO THE QUIT AND RESUME THING
[2:52:23] <SatansDick1> thats dumb
[2:52:27] <+Havinstroke> FIRST TRY??
[2:52:30] <+Grayhammatter> good luck fucker
[2:52:30] <%SaltyDongs> Sliding over cars while I shoot
[2:52:30] <+magusdraco> welp he's going the wrong way
[2:52:31] <%TheGershon> Something something Ice Cap Zone
[2:52:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> otherwise plague yells at you
[2:52:41] <@SSaryn> Time to do it in one try.
[2:52:42] <strangelee> This must be a cake walk in co-op
[2:52:43] <lycandruid> i seen this before in my hentais
[2:52:47] <lycandruid> kimiEZ
[2:52:50] <%BioApple> you did it, hooray
[2:52:53] <NonAddictiveSlurm> cant wait for pat to fal into a chasm that opens just below his feeties
[2:52:55] <element_of_loyalty> why cut scene
[2:52:57] <%QueequegTheater> first you quit
[2:52:57] <%Ferakin> Remember kids, don't do Chaos or you'll turn into a tree
[2:52:57] <fairore> you know i kinda wish in the ludwig fight when you get the second phase he's turns back into a human for the rest of the fight idk
[2:52:59] <+magusdraco> if you quit out you restart outside the boss room but one arm has been taken care of
[2:52:59] <%QueequegTheater> then you resume
[2:53:04] <%bevyrage> you just reload your game
[2:53:05] <+magusdraco> it saves your progress
[2:53:07] <prismaticsnake> if you quit here you'll be outside the boss fog
[2:53:10] <%altairibnlaahad909> yo quit out right now instead of dying so you dont have to do the bonfire run again each time
[2:53:16] <fairore> random thoughts
[2:53:19] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:53:19] <DSD24> Give the bed of Chaos a hand!
[2:53:20] <Ell1ot> what?
[2:53:21] <%bevyrage> ye
[2:53:21] <+Grayhammatter> "first" try
[2:53:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> Man. Dark Souls 2’s Dragon Bone Fist weapons is one of the best things throughout the Souls series.
[2:53:23] <%bevyrage> unless they fixed it
[2:53:26] <%NovaKnightmare> BIG COWARD
[2:53:28] <Sloavon> pat the cheater
[2:53:30] <%Press_X_ToJASON> hope they fixed
[2:53:37] <B_S_H> StinkyCheese
[2:53:42] <Gorgen> Not patched LUL
[2:53:43] <%Dingus_Tickler> Fucking Hehaichi in Dark Souls was the best.
[2:53:44] <+AXL808> cheater cheater pumpkin eater
[2:53:44] <strangelee> Not going to lie, I did this when I faught the Shark/Whale monsters in the Old Hunters DLC
[2:53:47] <%bevyrage> nope, happens both times if it isn't fixed
[2:53:49] <%NovaKnightmare> Thats what you call an exploitable

[2:54:08] <+Grayhammatter> PERFECT
[2:54:09] <SirSaki> *Whap!
[2:54:09] <element_of_loyalty> hmm
[2:54:09] <dsauce999> LUL
[2:54:10] <%BioApple> I bet they were going to patch it but then decided against it because they knew how shit it was
[2:54:10] <+AlphaAgito> Good example
[2:54:11] <%cryobyjorn> 1
[2:54:11] <%ECRead> good timing
[2:54:11] <%b0neh34d> Ded
[2:54:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> nice
[2:54:12] <+tegas_> Thank you for the example.
[2:54:13] <+AXL808> SUCCESS
[2:54:15] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:54:17] <%QueequegTheater> this game is totally not unfair guys
[2:54:18] <%Dingus_Tickler> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:54:19] <%NovaKnightmare> Im not gonna make fun of Pat, thats always bullshit
[2:54:20] <%Ferakin> Pat, is Epitaph your actual, real Stand?
[2:54:21] <Rosy_Joan> clipped for example
[2:54:25] <%Dingus_Tickler> GOOD STREAMER
[2:54:27] <%b0neh34d> That was the best example i've ever seen!
[2:54:29] <Jolly_Adventurer> @AngriestPat With some well thrown fire bombs you can stand in front of it and take care of the arms without running to the sides
[2:54:32] <%xemnahort> schinjGotEm
[2:54:35] <%Ferakin> And you're just playing along to fool us, so you can hide your true power?
[2:54:42] <+magusdraco> @AngriestPat Yeah well the "coward route" is "go do the right one first. Quit. Then use a bow on the left one while hugging the outside wall, Quit. Go through the drop in the middle"
[2:54:50] <Gorgen> This boss is easy if you just dont die
[2:54:50] <$eldrich_horror> get the right 1 first quit out then follow left wall and then you can throw bombs safly for second
[2:54:53] <fairore> isn't dark souls coming to the switch ?
[2:54:54] <DSD24> Is the Bed of Chaos the worst boss?
[2:55:03] <+magusdraco> or yeah the firebombs are the speedrun strat but good luck getting that first try
[2:55:03] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[2:55:06] <OkamiDude15> i cant wait for bed of chaos to be a stage in smash Kappa
[2:55:09] <%bevyrage> yes, it's quite possibly the worst boss of the entire series
[2:55:14] <strangelee> Don't forget your Binoculars @AngriestPat
[2:55:15] <%bevyrage> dark souls series
[2:55:18] <%PatNTheHat> @fairore "Eventually"
[2:55:27] <%bevyrage> there's a worse boss in demon's souls
[2:55:36] <DSD24> @bevyrage Dragon God?
[2:55:39] <fairore> @okamidude15 ha!
[2:55:39] <Jon_apar2> ash lake for smash
[2:55:40] <%ECRead> @OkamiDude15 Brinstar Kappa
[2:55:41] <%bevyrage> think so?
[2:55:41] <undeuxtroisqua> if 51% of your total body weight is composed of fat, does that mean you stop being designated as human and pass to become sentient fat?
[2:55:42] <%QueequegTheater> SOON (TM)
[2:55:46] <%xemnahort> Are there any bosses worse than bed of chaos in other series?
[2:55:48] <+magusdraco> which boss is worse in demon's souls?
[2:55:51] <Fleecemo> Binoculars are how you aim the Firebombs
[2:55:55] <%rdark_ksu> .....was that just a jello mold with eyes?
[2:55:55] <strangelee> To aim the Firebombs
[2:55:59] <+keksisblyat> Or a bow
[2:55:59] <NonAddictiveSlurm> which is that boss in DS2, you know, the worst one that it erases memories
[2:56:02] <Jolly_Adventurer> @AngriestPat Binoculars help you line it up
[2:56:03] <B_S_H> I only ever chz this boss this RNG BS time sink isn't worth doing legit TPFufun
[2:56:04] <%b0neh34d> New Smash Character: Dark Souls Dog
[2:56:09] <DSD24> @bevyrage He's the one you shoot the spears in his room at him then you hit his chin
[2:56:09] <%Dingus_Tickler> @undeuxtroisqua No… You just become pure Evil.
[2:56:12] <NonAddictiveSlurm> of its existance
[2:56:13] <%bevyrage> possibly dragon god. i don't remember the name of the boss in demon's souls, merely that it exists
[2:56:18] <%PatNTheHat> You taught Woolie the Binocular trick with his spells didn't you?
[2:56:20] <+magusdraco> eh he wasn't that bad
[2:56:24] <Ell1ot> this seems like it isn't going to work
[2:56:27] <%QueequegTheater> @NonAddictiveSlurm who do you mean
[2:56:29] <%Dingus_Tickler> Your Evil Percentage scales with your BMI
[2:56:33] <deviljhojho94> Just kill them all pat
[2:56:35] <+magusdraco> I mean this can work but it's gonna be real hard to do it
[2:56:41] <%xemnahort> @nonaddictiveslurm um none of them
[2:56:44] <DSD24> At least Dragon God punches you super hard if you beat the first boss
[2:56:45] <%bevyrage> oh hey progress was saved on death
[2:56:45] <undeuxtroisqua> over evil
[2:56:47] <Sloavon> why don't you just beat the boss with your superior videogame skills?
[2:56:56] <%Press_X_ToJASON> FIXED
[2:56:57] <strangelee> @Ell1ot Oh definitely, this is a waste of time. But it is possible.
[2:56:58] <grayjammer> Dragon God is a bad bossfight, but at least you can develop a consistent strategy for it
[2:56:58] <+AXL808> Invincible!
[2:57:00] <Trajanic> hitting the firebomb is super hard here
[2:57:00] <element_of_loyalty> what a bitch boss
[2:57:04] <Ell1ot> throw dung pies at her instead
[2:57:04] <Jolly_Adventurer> You have to be up front
[2:57:05] <deviljhojho94> IM FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[2:57:07] <fairore> @sloavon he doesn't have any
[2:57:08] <%bevyrage> you're going to need a bow for this range
[2:57:10] <Brainworm205> Yea I’ve never seen a need to cheese this boss. It’s easy af
[2:57:11] <DSD24> The Bed of Chaos music is bad too
[2:57:12] <Gorgen> Say hello to it
[2:57:16] <NonAddictiveSlurm> wait, does Dragonslayer count as a boss in DS2 because it kills itself more often than not
[2:57:23] <%PatNTheHat> 'CHEEEEEAT. The bosses are faster and tougher than you, so FUCKING CHEAT." _Pat, to Woolie
[2:57:24] <Gorgen> LUL
[2:57:24] <Ell1ot> you... did it
[2:57:25] <+Grayhammatter> hoo boy
[2:57:26] <element_of_loyalty> YEA
[2:57:27] <+magusdraco> you have to be like almost on top of where you go into the boss
[2:57:29] <%xemnahort> @nonaddictiveslurm there is no boss that erases memories in ds2
[2:57:30] <%s_xylocalsingles> sbfpPatschwitz
[2:57:31] <+magusdraco> you do it up close
[2:57:31] <thelonechris> That did nothing

[2:57:38] <%Keansor> He did it
[2:57:38] <Fleecemo> You have to know where to stand *and* where to aim to do it
[2:57:39] <+magusdraco> and throw it over her arms
[2:57:40] <%ECRead> s-scoot up
[2:57:40] <%Keansor> He beat the boss
[2:57:41] <Jolly_Adventurer> @AngriestPat You gotta be WAY closer. You've already taken an arm so I don't think you can do it.
[2:57:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> someone clip that
[2:57:42] <%bevyrage> they said it would be hard
[2:57:44] <AncelDeLambert> let the shitshow, BEGIN

[2:57:51] <+keksisblyat> Nice aim goob
[2:57:56] <%QueequegTheater> @NonAddictiveSlurm At least DragonRIDER (which is what I assume you're talking about) has an interesting arena
[2:57:59] <Gorgen> death in 10
[2:57:59] <%bevyrage> branch in the way
[2:58:02] <+Havinstroke> quaint
[2:58:06] <%BioApple> worst boss in DS2 was the one that was just 3 NPCs, I only ever beat it due to a memory leak
[2:58:08] <element_of_loyalty> THE END

[2:59:03] <+magusdraco> but yeah the firebomb strat is from like right in front of the boss not at the entrance
[2:59:03] <elvenwhiskey> best boss in the game
[2:59:04] <%altairibnlaahad909> worst. boss. ever.
[2:59:04] <%Everpresent_Overseer> He dodged it
[2:59:05] <%NovaKnightmare> I feel for Pat

[2:59:10] <+Allyofwar> Is this or Dragon God worse?
[2:59:17] <donny_pandairaz> Scoops! Hagen Dazs
[2:59:17] <+magusdraco> this
[2:59:21] <+trevopotamus> Bed of Chaos is such a terrible fight
[2:59:22] <+magusdraco> dragon god is scripted but predictable
[2:59:24] <AncelDeLambert> you should be able to jump over those sweeps in a sane world
[2:59:24] <%ECRead> this
[2:59:25] <elvenwhiskey> dragon god is better
[2:59:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat run up to the front of the boss and throw the firebomb o er the arms
[2:59:27] <+Grayhammatter> that ain't falco
[2:59:31] <Rosy_Joan> I just watched Pat get featherdusted to death.
[2:59:35] <+zeiss_schreiber> You tell him Elmo!
[2:59:35] <%patriotrenegade> Yo, Lost Izalith sucks
[2:59:37] <+MalignantUpper> CoolCat do better
[2:59:43] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> There speed runnings strats that need practice don’t bother
[2:59:44] <%altairibnlaahad909> dragon god is definitely better
[2:59:54] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:56] <%ECRead> oh absolutely
[3:00:15] <%QueequegTheater> Is anything in 2 or 3 even close to how abjectly bullshit as this fight?
[3:00:18] <%PatNTheHat> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot Good bot
[3:00:19] <%ECRead> HYDRO BOT <3
[3:00:36] <+trevopotamus> BoC is random, it has "gotcha" moments with the floors falling, and the run back is so annoying
[3:00:38] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo is speaking to us
[3:00:38] <+MalignantUpper> 🌊 stay hydrated
[3:00:40] <dekkitout> Oh, Hydro-can
[3:00:40] <%QueequegTheater> I swear I can grammar good
[3:00:45] <MyNameIsRasus> @queequegtheater The gargoyles in 2 fucking suck imo
[3:00:45] <%altairibnlaahad909> ancient dragon in ds2 used to be a stupid bullshit fight that is almost on the level of bullshit of bed of chaos
[3:00:46] <Ell1ot> throw the poo
[3:00:49] <alex_id> Do it good.
[3:00:52] <startadevy> lol n00b
[3:00:52] <%altairibnlaahad909> but they changed that in scholar of the first sin
[3:00:53] <%superc37> kill her gud
[3:00:55] <%olliedelosa> try the ranged battle
[3:00:59] <%altairibnlaahad909> to rebalance it
[3:01:00] <+magusdraco> Pat: "put on a bigger shield, or take off all your armor and put on the flip ring"
[3:01:01] <Gorgen> Dont die.
[3:01:03] <%PatNTheHat> KICK HER IN THE BALLS
[3:01:03] <elvenwhiskey> do the thing good
[3:01:05] <%Press_X_ToJASON> you can do dragon god objectively correctly and it works, but bed of chaos can just say fuck you anyways
[3:01:07] <%ECRead> the advice is: HYDRATE
[3:01:08] <+MalignantUpper> the complaints will give you power
[3:01:09] <%TheDullaMAN> You can do it, Pat-ikarp
[3:01:14] <%QueequegTheater> @MyNameIsRasus It's pretty manageable if you only focus on damaging one at a time
[3:01:14] <%altairibnlaahad909> so now ancient dragon is just a boring dragon fight
[3:01:15] <%mister___doctor> Pat dont die theres your advice
[3:01:17] <DraxTD> almost
[3:01:22] <AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:01:31] <+magusdraco> nice. now you can quit and reload again
[3:01:31] <%altairibnlaahad909> actually probably the most boring dragon fight in the series
[3:01:31] <%Agami23> remember when you needed a ring to protect you from back attacks from ancient dragon?
[3:01:31] <Ranger747> fuck good roll
[3:01:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you really need to look up the speedrun strat for this
[3:01:34] <%Dingus_Tickler> @altairibnlaahad909 Yeah but you can just put on your Anti-Backstab ring on and turn your back to his fire attack and take no damage LUL
[3:01:38] <%TheDullaMAN> You, did it.
[3:01:39] <+Grayhammatter> greato
[3:01:39] <+magusdraco> QUIT AND RELOAD AGAIN. COWARD IT OUT.

[3:02:05] <element_of_loyalty> the burning bush foe
[3:02:08] <%Agami23> they patched out the rings ability to save you from the ancient dragons fire.

[3:02:24] <BreakfastMan117> this is some pro strats for this boss right here
[3:02:25] <%BioApple> reminds me of the dragonrider armor from 3, which is also a bad fight imo
[3:02:33] <dekkitout> And so, the Lord of Cinder appeared before pat as a burning bush

[3:15:04] <%xemnahort> Red delicious apples suck
[3:15:05] <Bobato_Chaps> red apples are only good if you get them off a tree on the roadside
[3:15:05] <+Grayhammatter> the mustard queen only drinks mustard and WcNaldo's
[3:15:07] <MyNameIsRasus> green apple sounds like a shitty internet startup
[3:15:10] <$nitronLVIII> green apples are the true apples

[3:15:51] <Spydurman> LUL
[3:15:51] <Divryne> DO IT.
[3:15:52] <Trajanic> xenogears stream when?
[3:15:53] <%rdark_ksu> Hollowknight or fate pat take your pick
[3:15:53] <nepwar> LUL
[3:15:56] <+tegas_> Honestly I found hollow knight kind of boring.
[3:15:57] <NonAddictiveSlurm> LUL
[3:15:58] <Divryne> LORE.
[3:16:00] <$nitronLVIII> hmm
[3:16:03] <strangelee> It's not done?
[3:16:07] <KaiserMario> Neither is Dark Souls! UUUUUHHHH
[3:16:07] <+pleblu> Its best to just wait dude I dont mind
[3:16:07] <+The_Neo_Deus> Why do you need two hands to eat an apple?!
[3:16:08] <%Fairy_princess77> Hollow Knight is on Switch...
[3:16:08] <Divryne> Woolie probably missed out on so much.
[3:16:09] <OkamiDude15> why play warfram if its not done? @AngriestPat woopsThink
[3:16:10] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> wat
[3:16:11] <+magusdraco> ...honestly fair point. Just go play yakuza 0 PC
[3:16:14] <%ScatFace> it's done but it has some dlc up coming
[3:16:16] <%ssjklyco> Play it once on stream so that you will never play it again
[3:16:19] <startstoprepeat> you've been playing monster hunter and that isn't done.
[3:16:20] <Dapper_Cactuar> I think he means all the dlc isn't out yet
[3:16:21] <nepwar> do you not play MMOS. that's technically never done
[3:16:21] <%ScatFace> that's what he meant by not done
[3:16:21] <%Fairy_princess77> How is it not done?
[3:16:23] <Divryne> Judging by what he said on the podcast.
[3:16:24] <%QueequegTheater> do Sacrifice NOW
[3:16:26] <SatansDick1> its like daek souls
[3:16:26] <%Agami23> my brother just ragequit monster hunter world because of nergigante and started playing rainbow six siege. so sad
[3:16:28] <%DedlokPM> "Game is not even done" He says when he has already played Pillars 2
[3:16:36] <%xemnahort> I’ve been playing hollow knight and after 50 hours of nonstop fun and gameplay I can say... it’s ok I guess
[3:16:37] <Divryne> Sacrifice first then LP Hollow Knight for the channel.
[3:16:45] <%BioApple> Yeah but Hollow Knight will be done soon, I'm holding off for the same reason
[3:16:47] <NonAddictiveSlurm> also is the Hollowknight combat more than single slash and magic or is it mostly platforming like i hope it is
[3:16:50] <BlindGato> ARE YOU READY FOR A SACRIFICE?! -Vay Hek
[3:16:52] <OkamiDude15> hah "bug"
[3:16:58] <+pleblu> @Divryne Agreed
[3:16:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Does Hollow Knight have a BoC equivalent?
[3:17:01] <element_of_loyalty> Hollow KNight - dont care
[3:17:02] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat Ever intend to do Witcher on Stream?
[3:17:02] <nepwar> local ginger lies through his green apples
[3:17:02] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat How about some Shovel Knight?
[3:17:05] <%xemnahort> Pat says it’s not done but the last dlc will come out long before he reaches it
[3:17:08] <%QueequegTheater> This is now a Hekposting stream
[3:17:14] <Gehtingsberg> Little joe has no chance at sacrifice
[3:17:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> that's not how it works.
[3:17:18] <%TheGershon> I think if you REALLY love Metroidvanias then Hollow Knight is great. But if you don't then it's just pretty good
[3:17:21] <%TheDullaMAN> Heh..."bugging"
[3:17:21] <%ScatFace> @AngriestPat How far in octopath are you?

[3:29:52] <element_of_loyalty> So sad
[3:29:52] <DraxTD> I hope someone is clipping all these =P

[3:31:24] <%spacedroner1> You can't remaster a shitty boss fight I guess
[3:31:25] <+LogothX> If I got hit by a giant tree branch while naked, I'd probably make a louder noise than a soft "aaahh-"
[3:31:25] <MyNameIsRasus> IT'S ONLY THE COLD WIND I FEEEEEEL
[3:31:36] <%xemnahort> We all love bedwoman
[3:31:41] <%olliedelosa> What even is this fight. I've never played Dark Souls and I can't even come close to figuring out a strat for this.
[3:31:41] <+Grayhammatter> "Aaaaaah"
[3:31:46] <KaiserMario> So... Terry on FLEX huh? Pretty cool!
[3:31:47] <+LogothX> It's never too late to back down.
[3:31:50] <+reddpop_> Go switch to SFV
[3:31:50] <+MalignantUpper> only cowards are too afraid to quit
[3:31:56] <%QueequegTheater> @olliedelosa the strat is get lucky
[3:31:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> almost hitting the back
[3:32:00] <+Yokuho> All he has to do is either roll over it or block
[3:32:00] <%NovaKnightmare> Nito is easy
[3:32:02] <KaiserMario> @reddpop_ YES
[3:32:02] <+keksisblyat> angriestpat Use a shield to block the swipes
[3:32:08] <MyNameIsRasus> backdown like you did in re5 wjth the upgrades
[3:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> terry in SNK heroines and FLEX?
[3:32:17] <%xemnahort> @olliedelosa the strat is to fail
[3:32:20] <+magusdraco> could have done tomb of the giants in like 2 minutes
[3:32:21] <%ssjklyco> Then do it
[3:32:21] <+SailingSaturn> "I'm too deep into meth to just quit. I'd be a Quitter!" cirThink
[3:32:24] <%ScatFace> Look at the bright side, the dlc is some of the best the souls franchise can offer
[3:32:25] <+Hamblasto> How's it feel, Seath?
[3:32:29] <%QueequegTheater> Use the Vergilmobile
[3:32:36] <%spacedroner1> "I can't stop smoking crack now, that's quitter talk!"

[3:59:16] <arcadeking48> Im not one to kink shame but Seeth has some weird fetishes
[3:59:19] <%Agami23> pat experimented on paige and turned her into a piscala like these poor tentacle faced fuckers
[3:59:24] <%BioApple> Is this splatoon londo
[3:59:34] <%spacedroner1> Seath couldn't make a squid girl with enough tentacles for his weird squid wiener
[3:59:34] <+Yokuho> 3 crying ones
[3:59:34] <TalisKanju> Two octopus things with one stone
[3:59:35] <MyNameIsRasus> are they a kid now
[3:59:43] <Huntercd> @spacedroner1 Is the time cube strong?
[3:59:44] <%QueequegTheater> STANDO POWER
[3:59:46] <%NovaKnightmare> So... what was Seath's deal with women?
[3:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:50] <%SaltyDongs> You'll never see it coming
[3:59:56] <+keksisblyat> Or a squid now
[3:59:57] <%QueequegTheater> @NovaKnightmare He liked to rape them
[4:00:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Ewwww
[4:00:05] <%BioApple> Don't worry schick hydrobot, pat has been drinking 32 oz of red bull
[4:00:08] <SatansDick1> so how did seeth become ebrietes
[4:00:11] <%spacedroner1> Why drink water when you can drink redbull?
[4:00:13] <KitsuneManami> Nice Try? He almost killed u
[4:00:21] <+Yokuho> schick hydrobot, that was sick
[4:00:24] <%QueequegTheater> @NovaKnightmare How did you think Priscilla was conceived?
[4:00:26] <+ozzyzak> who needs water?
[4:00:26] <Huntercd> @NovaKnightmare He is a misogynist
[4:00:28] <ThePuddingDead> "Awwwwwww. Coooome ooooon...."
[4:00:29] <element_of_loyalty> REMASTERED
[4:00:33] <%NovaKnightmare> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
[4:00:41] <MyNameIsRasus> could they kid and a squid and kid a squid and a kid
[4:00:41] <arcadeking48> @NovaKnightmare No, he did not rape them. He used them in horrible experiments that warped their bodies in to hideous, insane, abominations.
[4:00:42] <$SGrim> rooBlind
[4:00:49] <NonAddictiveSlurm> pour some PJSalt on Hydrobot
[4:00:53] <KaiserMario> Now kill those two down there for miracles
[4:00:54] <element_of_loyalty> STOP WHINING
[4:00:57] <%NovaKnightmare> I dont think thats better but it is more PG in a sense
[4:01:00] <+Yokuho> Those cogs look shiny as fuck in the remaster, huh
[4:01:02] <Lysdexic9541> @spacedroner1 Why drink Red Bull when you can inject it into your veins?
[4:01:04] <SatansDick1> the astral clocktower
[4:01:05] <%NovaKnightmare> either way fuck Seath
[4:01:08] <grayjammer> The stairs were supposed to originally be able to be rotated is why
[4:01:11] <zal_silverfang> probably a moving staircase of some sort
[4:01:14] <TalisKanju> Hydrobot is now a slug
[4:01:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its a gear pile
[4:01:27] <%spacedroner1> @Lysdexic9541 Just snort the powdered caffeine, I'm pretty sure that's what Stephen King does
[4:01:31] <%QueequegTheater> @NovaKnightmare Third point: Gwynevere is almost certainly the mother, and Gwyn had to "reward" Seathe for helping him fight the Ancient Dragons.
[4:01:32] <AncelDeLambert> probably some kind of elevator to access the books
[4:01:33] <element_of_loyalty> 2am
[4:01:42] <arcadeking48> @NovaKnightmare Oh yeah, guy's a dick. And the worst part is that its implied he used to be kind of a cool guy, he just totally lost it over the years
[4:01:49] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @novaknightmare at most he had a Bowser complex of "Capture princess, ???, profit/kid with princess"
[4:01:50] <MyNameIsRasus> fucking 3 am here
[4:01:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Seth can fly.
[4:01:55] <$MightyMaxT> Miracles...
[4:01:57] <Medo3G> so next stream is DLC + gwyn?
[4:01:57] <vile740> hes giant dragon he can just reach them
[4:02:00] <MyNameIsRasus> he can fly
[4:02:03] <%spacedroner1> Seath is just a huge hipster who has books on his shelves just to say that he does
[4:02:07] <+TMulharin> be super tall
[4:02:10] <TalisKanju> Kind of like Mementos
[4:02:10] <Trillex56> the flow of time is convoluted thats how you get the books
[4:02:11] <ApocRage> @AngriestPat Maybe it was a big machine that let people get to the books and Seath broke it because it was in the way.
[4:02:16] <KaiserMario> Seath's a blind dragon... are these all Braille???
[4:02:16] <%ssjklyco> i just realized there are books in the stairs
[4:02:20] <%QueequegTheater> @NonAddictiveSlurm Aside from raping Priscilla into Gwynevere, yeah, he was totally not that but
[4:02:22] <%Agami23> isnt there items in those cells? like rings that do nothing or something?
[4:02:24] <$ookiiapple> @AngriestPat you say jail cell. i say display case
[4:02:24] <%QueequegTheater> *bad
[4:02:26] <+magusdraco> you're huge enough for kalameet pat and if you aren't getting up to 30 vit will make you huge enough
[4:02:27] <ThePuddingDead> I can't look at Dark Souls without thinking of Plague's video on it, Gwynerear was great
[4:02:28] <%NovaKnightmare> Weird thing with Seath is how hes a Dragon but his MO is more like a creepy mad scientist, if you decsribed his personality, you'd think of a Eggman/Wily instead of a fucking Dragon
[4:02:33] <%davy_cokit> Wings dumby
[4:02:36] <Bacon_Rage> the guys with 6 eyes read the books to seath :)
[4:02:46] <Gorgen> Rip floating door
[4:02:48] <Caidezes> Is that floating door still up there?
[4:02:57] <Medo3G> oh btw someone found out where the floating door was supposed to be
[4:02:58] <+Grayhammatter> with their 6 sets of eyes
[4:02:59] <MyNameIsRasus> look at the door
[4:03:00] <NonAddictiveSlurm> he's like Hojo but somehow less creepy
[4:03:05] <%spacedroner1> Wasn't there some lore stuff about the guys who kidnap maidens reading the books to Seath because his eyes suck
[4:03:11] <+magusdraco> look for the flying door that probably still exists
[4:03:15] <+mgskomododragon> can we see... THE DOOR???
[4:03:18] <element_of_loyalty> Chrystal Dildos
[4:03:22] <Caidezes> IT'S STILL THERE
[4:03:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> flyinh door
[4:03:24] <arcadeking48> @Medo3G Where was it meant to go?

[4:03:25] <+Grayhammatter> still there
[4:03:26] <+tigerfang86> THE DOOR

[4:03:47] <rytisone> a way out
[4:03:48] <Medo3G> it belongs to the previous room
[4:03:49] <ThePuddingDead> any lore behind door-chan?
[4:03:52] <AncelDeLambert> which goes to show the game is nothing but a new texture pack
[4:03:53] <Spydurman> the door still there?
[4:03:55] <dan_g_v> that's the gods door
[4:03:55] <RutlerTheButler> thats just more of seath's trickery
[4:03:56] <Lysdexic9541> Do they just not know? LUL
[4:03:56] <%ssjklyco> its adoorable

[4:07:51] <Huntercd> Did Pat get shot in the face?
[4:07:52] <SatansDick1> anime is bad
[4:07:55] <SatansDick1> yes
[4:08:09] <KiraKamixephos> Is the stream over? Just got here
[4:08:10] <+Hamblasto> But Brennan likes anime and he is good
[4:08:12] <dan_g_v> so, overlord is still only good when they remove all the main characters?
[4:08:17] <%TheGershon> omfg it's Myth & Roid
[4:08:23] <dan_g_v> Pat is taking a little break
[4:08:24] <hntronium> Overlord

[4:13:08] <AncelDeLambert> WHY
[4:13:08] <ThePuddingDead> you know good and well
[4:13:09] <Huntercd> Is it porn?
[4:13:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hero aca is just a shit version of hunter x hunter. its what hunter x hunter is subverting
[4:13:13] <Lysdexic9541> @spacedroner1 @QueequegTheater Sounds good. I'll probably check it out over the weekend
[4:13:14] <%Dingus_Tickler> I thought Season 3 of MHA ended after the All Might and All For One fight… Then I found out they kept going. Like 8 episodes type of going
[4:13:28] <%D_day> @angriestpat did you see the girl who beat DS with a DDR pad?
[4:13:35] <dan_g_v> so, when does Marcus start releasing new challenges?
[4:13:36] <%spacedroner1> @lysdexic9541 fair warning tho sometimes it gets slow because the author loves to world build
[4:13:38] <%TheGershon> @Dingus_Tickler that was only the first half of s3
[4:13:39] <epicddt> hi
[4:13:48] <%TheGershon> It is a two cour season I believe
[4:13:49] <SatansDick1> oh yeah a girl beat ds on a ddr pad
[4:13:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hero aca = asassination classroom = soul eater
[4:13:57] <+keksisblyat> God Backstabbing with a scythe is still dumb
[4:13:58] <%QueequegTheater> @Lysdexic9541 literally the entire first ten minutes is just the MC talking to himself in his empty guild hall as the game's servers are shutting down. This writer fucking GETS IT.
[4:13:59] <KaiserMario> Will the anime explain better, or worse, King Crimson's ability?
[4:14:08] <%Dingus_Tickler> @thegershon And I haven’t watched the episodes after that, holy shit
[4:14:08] <+centrilion> Hello!
[4:14:10] <%ssjklyco> Hello
[4:14:13] <BakedBam> crazy talk just aprked a little
[4:14:19] <%D_day> New people monkaS
[4:14:19] <%TheGershon> Hero Aca shits on Soul Eater I WILL die on that hill
[4:14:20] <dan_g_v> too tough to break
[4:14:21] <+keksisblyat> @KaiserMario Hope so
[4:14:29] <Lysdexic9541> I can't remember his name but theres a streamer who beat all the Soulsborne games with his feet
[4:14:36] <%QueequegTheater> @KaiserMario I think I read that DP is going to try and clarify some of KC's actions better than the manga
[4:14:39] <%ltdogg707> whats up AlDavisBoil
[4:14:40] <%spacedroner1> @QueequegTheater @Lysdexic9541 considering the author is a huge fucking DnD nerd who wrote the novels because his friends were too busy to play, he gets it 100% unlike
[4:14:47] <AncelDeLambert> start rotating those stairs
[4:14:55] <dan_g_v> is that the one who is missing one arm, @Lysdexic9541 ?
[4:14:58] <%spacedroner1> unlike SAO which is so out of touch
[4:15:04] <AncelDeLambert> Pats and ladders, the wonderful game that you play with your friends!
[4:15:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but hero aca and soul eater and assassination classroom all have the same plot and structure. fucking shool settings
[4:15:15] <%ssjklyco> I just finished LetterKenny season 2 on hulu. That show is great. Send the rest, canada
[4:15:18] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater Hopefully, that stuff was ... "bizarre" har har...
[4:15:18] <%QueequegTheater> @spacedroner1 Reki Kawahara is a fucking hack
[4:15:22] <%TheGershon> Yeah but the school really isn't even the point
[4:15:30] <TalisKanju> Still in a dream, Dark Souls?
[4:15:32] <ThePuddingDead> Hell I just started watching it today, and read volumes 1 and 2 of the manga, seriously, what is Bakuga's fuckin deal!?
[4:15:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i know, which is why i hate that it even is a thing
[4:15:48] <Lysdexic9541> @dan_g_v I know who you're referring to but not him.
[4:15:52] <dan_g_v> amazingly, he gets better Pudding
[4:15:55] <Medo3G> twist it
[4:15:57] <Medo3G> bop it
[4:15:57] <Basch71> its as if they're stories made for kids Kappa
[4:15:58] <knomad2b> yeah taking place in a school doesn't mean much
[4:15:59] <%TheGershon> @ThePuddingDead you'll see
[4:16:00] <Quietshun13> Bakugo is great, you'll see
[4:16:03] <%spacedroner1> Bakugo is a huge edgelord
[4:16:05] <dan_g_v> like, he really grows up as a character
[4:16:07] <Huntercd> I still hate Bakugo
[4:16:09] <hntronium> Bakugoat
[4:16:14] <dan_g_v> he's still a damn dumbass, tho :3
[4:16:26] <hntronium> BAKUGREATEST OF ALL TIME
[4:16:27] <%QueequegTheater> @ThePuddingDead His deal is that he has serious problems stemming from being handed everything as a child and living with a physical abuser for a mother
[4:16:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lots of things are for kids, why would you want shit about school when youre a kid
[4:16:31] <%ltdogg707> so much Bakugo hate in chat
[4:16:33] <+jorgamund> please stop clanking around so loudly in the library
[4:16:50] <dan_g_v> tell that to the people made out of crystal, @jorgamund
[4:16:51] <%spacedroner1> Bakugo's mom is 10/10
[4:16:59] <+keksisblyat> CHAT, real question is Who is Best Girl in My Hero?
[4:17:00] <%TheGershon> Cause it's a way cooler school than you'll ever go to
[4:17:09] <%spacedroner1> Then again anyone who slaps Bakugo's shit is S rank
[4:17:10] <%TheGershon> Bakumom
[4:17:12] <SatansDick1> bakugos mom
[4:17:13] <MyNameIsRasus> a
[4:17:13] <Quietshun13> all of them
[4:17:13] <Nedlin> Froppy
[4:17:16] <AncelDeLambert> Bakugo's problems are 100% genetic
[4:17:16] <hntronium> Bakumom
[4:17:19] <%TheGershon> 2nd place Mina
[4:17:20] <dan_g_v> Miruko, of course
[4:17:22] <%QueequegTheater> @spacedroner1 and also seems to legitimately enjoy hitting her only child all the time, but tits make it okay I guess
[4:17:23] <Huntercd> @ltdogg707 He deserves it
[4:17:24] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S A LOT A DAMAGE
[4:17:34] <dan_g_v> dem muscles
[4:17:36] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> So how's that Golden Golem?
[4:17:38] <%spacedroner1> Her only child is a fuck who deserves to get his shit slapped
[4:17:40] <%QueequegTheater> @Huntercd nobody deserves to be abused by their parents
[4:17:40] <JustGrumble> Holy shit, I’m awake early enough to watch live
[4:17:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i just really dislike the school setting shit for everything, its so played out. like forty percent of all anime is school anime
[4:17:42] <%ssjklyco> If they ruined My Hero Aca and did a naruto jump to after they graduate UA, would it just be called My Heroes?
[4:17:44] <Spydurman> LUL
[4:17:50] <KaiserMario> I still have a hard time accepting these highschoolers not dating each other, or just constantly thinking about it...I mean... Japan is just so stupid with writing human interaction...
[4:18:06] <ThePuddingDead> Wait so he's pissy cuz he's a fuckin asshole and gets disciplined by his mom?
[4:18:07] <KaiserMario> MHA, btw
[4:18:23] <hntronium> Nah, they just have priorities
[4:18:23] <%spacedroner1> He's mad because Deku exists
[4:18:25] <AncelDeLambert> he's pissy because he's his mother's son and they're both naturally pissy assholes
[4:18:29] <$Smolkupo> Fire keeper in anor londo
[4:18:31] <ThePuddingDead> ah
[4:18:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Did you kill the one in Anor Londo?
[4:18:36] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean Uraraka is the personification of thirst tho
[4:18:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> japan i bad with human interaction period, more deaths than births for like seven years in a row. they cant even find male porn stars.
[4:18:43] <Spydurman> what about new anor londo?
[4:18:43] <$SGrim> @fruit_pie_the_magician it's almost like it's mass marketed to high schoolers to sell them over priced shit they can afford because no rent rooSellout
[4:18:44] <Divryne> Anal Londo Pat.
[4:18:46] <%QueequegTheater> @ThePuddingDead Not disciplined. Beaten. Physical abuse has been shown over, and over, and over again, to lead to mental problems
[4:18:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[4:18:47] <$eldrich_horror> logans prison
[4:18:51] <Divryne> Yes.
[4:18:53] <%altairibnlaahad909> theres one down at the prison in dukes archives
[4:18:59] <StarSkullyman> duh
[4:19:00] <%QueequegTheater> *Prolonged physical abuse
[4:19:01] <KaiserMario> @hntronium And that's why their birthrates are plummeting
[4:19:02] <%ssjklyco> I kinda like that it's no all "Hey ,youre hot, lets date and have drama". Kinda gets tiring in regular TV shows
[4:19:05] <+keksisblyat> Kill the other Fire Keepers Also one in the cell Where Logan gets captured @AngriestPat
[4:19:07] <%ltdogg707> well hes had life handed to him on a silver platter because of his amazing quirk, hes gonna be a bit off
[4:19:14] <Medo3G> "does the firekeeper drop a firekeeper souls?" pat asks
[4:19:15] <AncelDeLambert> Pat
[4:19:16] <%altairibnlaahad909> also kill one of the other fire keepers for the 5th one
[4:19:18] <AncelDeLambert> PAT
[4:19:23] <AncelDeLambert> are you fucking with us?
[4:19:29] <StarSkullyman> pat
[4:19:34] <Quietshun13> In the anime his mom only bit him knee over the head when he was being a shit
[4:19:37] <%QueequegTheater> @ltdogg707 Explanation Point has a great video on why Bakugo is such a shit-ass.
[4:19:39] <+keksisblyat> PAt pls like you never saw this?
[4:19:39] <Caidezes> lmfao
[4:19:40] <hntronium> @KaiserMario Did you know that all first world countries have plummeting birth rates?
[4:19:40] <%Keansor> Well that's just embarrassing...
[4:19:43] <Medo3G> P A T
[4:19:45] <hntronium> Much wow
[4:19:45] <Quietshun13> *once
[4:19:47] <+ForteBlade> pat
[4:19:48] <segychan> aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[4:19:49] <+jorgamund> PAT, I bring word from the future! the encrypted message says... uh... "You are blind"
[4:19:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[4:19:57] <%ltdogg707> Pat are you kidding
[4:19:59] <%PatNTheHat> HOW CAN THIS BE>
[4:20:01] <%QueequegTheater> @hntronium And Japan's is particularly bad
[4:20:07] <MyNameIsRasus> ! BRAIN AT RISK !
[4:20:07] <KaiserMario> @ssjklyco That is true, but not even passing remarks, except for jcreepy hentai gags
[4:20:11] <AncelDeLambert> Blinder than his wife, this man
[4:20:18] <hntronium> So what, they're all getting bad.
[4:20:23] <%Thadota> For as much as he stares at things, Pat misses a lot of things apatSmug apatSmug
[4:20:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> japans is so bad their population is dropping
[4:20:26] <$Smolkupo> @AngriestPat You also get one if you do the Lautrec quest too
[4:20:32] <KaiserMario> @hntronium Because of "priorities"
[4:20:37] <dan_g_v> That thang?
[4:20:49] <AncelDeLambert> where is he going?
[4:20:54] <%QueequegTheater> @Smolkupo you don't actually use that one though.
[4:20:56] <arcadeking48> We have lowering birth rates because in general people are less obsessed with sex and relationships these days. We as a society have finally realized that its better to wait to have kids, or maybe not have kids at all, than to put a serious financial burden like a child on yourself.
[4:20:58] <hntronium> That's right. They have priorities other than burning their country down
[4:20:58] <dan_g_v> he going to kill Seath
[4:21:12] <%TheGershon> Todoroki and Momo have a spinoff light novel where they go on one date... and of course nothing actually happens between them
[4:21:23] <%spacedroner1> Of course the two rich kids get paired up
[4:21:26] <%Thadota> Why is this discourse happening in a Dark Souls strea wadduhek
[4:21:29] <%TheGershon> Because status quo
[4:21:33] <AncelDeLambert> Japan's media's approach to dating is trash
[4:21:36] <%Thadota> *stream
[4:21:40] <KaiserMario> @hntronium how's having kids burning your country?
[4:21:44] <%QueequegTheater> @hntronium Like pretending the Rape of Nanking didn't happen. Crazy how much japanese media loves to emphasize forgiveness. I'm sure the two are totally unrelated.
[4:21:47] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 92
[4:21:52] <@SSaryn> I come back to Japanese birth rates after like.. 5 minutes.
[4:21:53] <%TheGershon> It's Pat's fault for bringing up MHA for like 5 seconds
[4:21:54] <TalisKanju> What is Japanese Media's approach to dating?
[4:21:55] <@SSaryn> What the hell is going on.
[4:22:00] <%Keansor> "Going" crazy
[4:22:00] <SatansDick1> good job pat you have your chat talking about anime
[4:22:01] <%spacedroner1> I wish I knew I was just talking about anime
[4:22:04] <+keksisblyat> Jesus
[4:22:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Japan as a society is kind o ftrash good games tho
[4:22:09] <ThePuddingDead> Yeah but so far, I like what I've read and watched, All Might's great. I'll keep at it.
[4:22:12] <KaiserMario> @TalisKanju Pathetic

[4:22:20] <$kwild> shield + longsword. thats thee experience
[4:22:22] <%spacedroner1> All Might is best dad
[4:22:24] <$Smolkupo> Suddenly everyone in here is an expert on Japan because they watch anime, lol
[4:22:27] <AncelDeLambert> let's get back to shitting on Pat
[4:22:33] <%ltdogg707> do i smell crazy talk?
[4:22:38] <%QueequegTheater> don't forget about the Japanese officers who had a competition to see who could behead the most prisoners at a time
[4:22:42] <TalisKanju> @KaiserMario I mean what makes it pathetic though?
[4:22:47] <MrKellogg> We in here during a Dark Souls Twitch stream trying to figure out how to fix Japan's falling birthrate
[4:22:48] <KaiserMario> @AncelDeLambert Nah man... that's just me...

[4:23:00] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Crazytok activate
[4:23:01] <%BioApple> you want to fix japan's birthrate, just toss me in a room with the frog girl

[4:23:13] <+NWR_James> WE LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU

[4:23:23] <dan_g_v> we are talking about important thangs
[4:23:25] <%TheGershon> I'mma keep it real with you Shinzo Abe Prime Minister of Japan. Aint nobody fixing that declining birth rate
[4:23:26] <Lysdexic9541> @Smolkupo Well, you have to study Japanese history for a minimum of 10 years to watch anime Kappa
[4:23:27] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Thanks for streaming and for the fisticuffs this week :)
[4:23:28] <@SSaryn> You're talking about BULLSHIT more like.

[4:23:32] <+keksisblyat> Asking this now?
[4:23:33] <ThePuddingDead> How did we go from My Hero Academia to Rape of Nanking watching a pudgy ginger playing Dark Souls at 2 am on a saturday...???
[4:23:35] <AncelDeLambert> asking this meow? Yes, he is, nya
[4:23:35] <SatansDick1> theyre talking abut anime
[4:23:35] <Divryne> Pat you must understand you are weirder than all of us combined.
[4:23:36] <%ssjklyco> The lasagna refridgerater guy says we are weird
[4:23:37] <%ltdogg707> we're fans of you pat. we gonna be weird.
[4:23:37] <%QueequegTheater> @Huntercd I'm sure they were. It was their grandparents who raped their way across China
[4:23:42] <KaiserMario> @TalisKanju They create an artificial and unrealistic approach to relationships, and are too concerned with kepping appearances
[4:24:05] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Are you gonna go back for that chest Pat?
[4:24:08] <arcadeking48> @ThePuddingDead Does that not make sense to you? Do you not see the logical connections?
[4:24:10] <SatansDick1> pat help your chat is filled with weebs
[4:24:14] <TalisKanju> @KaiserMario Okay, that does sound pathetic
[4:24:16] <AncelDeLambert> where is he going?

[4:24:31] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I just got here, wha happen?
[4:24:32] <%Keansor> Overwork being one of the highest causes of death doesn't help. Little hard to have time for kids/relationship when you work 80 hours a work
[4:24:33] <$kwild> you draw a crowd attracted to your interests and they are weird...
[4:24:36] <KaiserMario> @TalisKanju Thank you!

[4:25:06] <SatansDick1> oh TITANs looks awful
[4:25:11] <%QueequegTheater> There is picture evidence of Nanking, and yet the Japanese government has never apologgized for it
[4:25:11] <Medo3G> pat nooooo
[4:25:14] <ThePuddingDead> @SSaryn Is season 3 even worth watching? season 2 fuckin killed it for me...in a bad way

[4:25:42] <%PatNTheHat> Sleep is for FUCKING NERds
[4:25:48] <%Thadota> Time to UberEats some McDonalds
[4:25:49] <Divryne> End their misery.
[4:25:51] <%spacedroner1> This is how a normal human does things
[4:25:51] <suddenlyscorched> 2AM Red Bull is the most delicious Red Bull
[4:25:51] <Divryne> Kill em all.
[4:25:56] <crimsonharvest> litearlly mowed them down
[4:25:56] <%QueequegTheater> @DesuDesuDokiDoki Aside from the horrific treatment of POWs in WWII and the rampant sexism and racism
[4:25:57] <%ltdogg707> Pat murdering women
[4:26:00] <Divryne> 410 billion dead maidens.
[4:26:01] <TalisKanju> What wins? Pat's love for Red Bull, or Paige's love of mustard?
[4:26:02] <AncelDeLambert> no bighat to tell to fuck off
[4:26:02] <%Everpresent_Overseer> is this how PAt behaves at clubs?
[4:26:03] <Medo3G> now use ir
[4:26:03] <Huntercd> @QueequegTheater I would visit the peace park in Hiroshima on liberty. The people are well aware of WW2
[4:26:04] <arcadeking48> Pat: Currently reliving last Saturday night
[4:26:08] <@SSaryn> Murder those woman for their clothes.
[4:26:09] <TheMilhouseExperience> Should have never mentioned MHA.
[4:26:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the food is good tho
[4:26:10] <%ssjklyco> Monsters taste better anyway
[4:26:16] <$RaikenTB> you can sleep when you're dead.
[4:26:16] <Lysdexic9541> Sleep is for the DEAD
[4:26:19] <SatansDick1> pat has become paige, murderer of women
[4:26:19] <arcadeking48> "Hey girls, what's up?" followed by lots of sticky murder
[4:26:26] <AncelDeLambert> god, he's just gonna beat it tonight
[4:26:26] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater HEY! You get it!!!
[4:26:27] <%TheGershon> Pat this is why you end up on the podcast talking about how you only got 2 hours of sleep lol
[4:26:31] <%breakfastmagepowers> I love murdering women for their clothes
[4:26:31] <KahtaLzargo> Actual mermaids
[4:26:37] <%PatNTheHat> Nothing was more painful than watching my brother's tweenage friends all share a single red bull and talk about how they were "feeling it"
[4:26:38] <%spacedroner1> Only scrubs drink energy drinks. I chew my coffee beans like a real man
[4:26:42] <%QueequegTheater> @Huntercd Yeah, only our part in it, not theirs. Schoolchildren are not even taught about the Chinese occupation.
[4:26:48] <hntronium> Pat, I thought you unfucked your sleep schedule
[4:26:49] <AncelDeLambert> yeah it is
[4:26:57] <KaiserMario> Japan is great, but it's far from perfect... That's all...
[4:26:57] <@SSaryn> And then he lets it set in.
[4:27:06] <TheyCallMeVawn> I know the struggle Pat
[4:27:08] <zal_silverfang> so, Insomnia
[4:27:10] <ThePuddingDead> caffeine od
[4:27:11] <AncelDeLambert> you get shit sleep because you're coked out on caffiene at 1 AM
[4:27:12] <President_valentine> fix your sleep schedule
[4:27:14] <ThePuddingDead> will do that to ya
[4:27:14] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat what is your opinion on the rape of Nanking
[4:27:15] <Basch71> all the time
[4:27:16] <Mrthepastyrider> Pat lies awake, awash in the sins of his past.
[4:27:18] <TalisKanju> Like every country in the history of ever.
[4:27:24] <%ssjklyco> I thought you fixed your sleep schedule because of exercising?
[4:27:26] <AncelDeLambert> stop drinking Red Bull after 5
[4:27:27] <%QueequegTheater> let's get a good soundclip here
[4:27:28] <%GarbageNirvana> No place is perfect, it's just a matter of figuring out what fucked up shit you're willing to put up with
[4:27:30] <ThePuddingDead> yeah that
[4:27:30] <+NWR_James> @Mrthepastyrider sins of redbull
[4:27:32] <%spacedroner1> @QueequegTheater he's not going to answer that man
[4:27:33] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater Dude, there are children her!
[4:27:38] <ThePuddingDead> no way
[4:27:39] <MyNameIsRasus> maybe you should stop with the redbulls at 2am then
[4:27:39] <%TheGershon> Yeah dude you have to just keep it consistent
[4:27:45] <%PatNTheHat> @AngriestPat I think that's pretty par for the course for OCD. It's the same for me anyway
[4:27:53] <$Smolkupo> > Drinks Redbull at 1 > Can't fall asleep LUL
[4:27:54] <$SGrim> @QueequegTheater until that second comment, I was incredibly confused why you'd asked that out of the blue. rookek
[4:28:01] <Huntercd> Pat drink water you fuck!!
[4:28:05] <$SGrim> rooKek FUCK FeelsGoodMan 🔫
[4:28:08] <+RevaniteRyan> Strength go up
[4:28:11] <arcadeking48> Gonna go ahead and say no country is inherently good or bad? No country has a spotless track record, and every country is full of good and bad people. History is a long, ugly coffee stained tapestry of miracles, charity, sins agaisnt creation, and weird shit nobody quite understands.
[4:28:12] <%spacedroner1> Hey it's Piss golem
[4:28:15] <%QueequegTheater> Wait why is he going here
[4:28:16] <$kwild> thats normal apathy

[4:28:31] <%TheGershon> @PatNTheHat that's also a thing. I regularly just lie in bed for an hour because my mind just wont stop
[4:28:32] <%spacedroner1> "Facking paaaanch!" -dunkey
[4:28:33] <%ssjklyco> I would donate $50 is pat can go two weeks without a redbull or energy drink.
[4:28:33] <Boopamann> wwham
[4:28:41] <AncelDeLambert> put the red bull in the fridge and GO TO BED
[4:28:48] <%spacedroner1> @ssjklyco he'll just use the money to buy more redbull
[4:28:48] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat have you tried reading a book before bed to unwind or using white noise machine?
[4:28:50] <@SSaryn> Sleep is for the weak.
[4:28:54] <%QueequegTheater> @arcadeking48 the difference is that Germany doesn't pretend the Holocaust didn't happen, the United States didn't forget about the Trail of Tears
[4:29:07] <MinnitMann> pat killing SEETH
[4:29:08] <%spacedroner1> Man we're still on Japan huh
[4:29:10] <MinnitMann> whattup chat

[4:29:16] <AncelDeLambert> there are very clear systems of advice for fixing a sleep schedule, Pat ignores them all
[4:29:17] <MinnitMann> lilmajYOU GOOD LUCK DUDE
[4:29:18] <%QueequegTheater> japan is a fuck
[4:29:19] <@SSaryn> THey're dumb.
[4:29:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the united states just likes to gloss over every shady thing it ever did

[4:29:38] <%ssjklyco> @spacedroner1 I don't care really. I can't see him making it 2 days
[4:29:40] <@SSaryn> The ladies love 'em.
[4:29:40] <%spacedroner1> Wouldn't the shooting crystals clog up their breath holes, how does that work
[4:29:41] <%ltdogg707> Can we stop talking about tragic historical events? please!?
[4:29:45] <arcadeking48> @QueequegTheater The US does consistently profit on the marginalization of opressed people and cultural appropriation on a massive scale and nobody int he government has said a word about that.
[4:29:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> for example intentionally fucking up other countries with legitimate democracies
[4:29:59] <KaiserMario> Wow, we just killed the anime talks... Sorry guys, don't feel bad for enjoying anime, just keep in mind that Japan is super messed up so... you know...
[4:30:22] <Quietshun13> move off of this guys.
