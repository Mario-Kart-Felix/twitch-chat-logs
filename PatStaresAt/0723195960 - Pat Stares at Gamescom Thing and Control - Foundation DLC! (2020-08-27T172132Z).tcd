[1:34:58] <%TheSpartanThief> "Low Earth Orbit is basically space" - Pat
[1:34:59] <%mikessdd> I'll do it when Ace Combat is just STAR WARS
[1:34:59] <huskarl_zap> ea is so dull they cant even cause fake controversy anymorw
[1:34:59] <WyvernsArentDragons> for the final mission do you have to play both sides at the same time?

[1:48:15] <KingZaffy> Yo, turn based shooter?
[1:48:15] <+swordoftheberserk> this is stealing from an already existing game
[1:48:16] <+michingmallecho> Timeline??
[1:48:16] <Samhotdamn> looks bad
[1:48:17] <DetroitSentai> 1v1
[1:48:18] <$floralkami> WAIT, ISN'T THIS THAT INDIE GAME?
[1:48:18] <+beardedjho> Thats an interesting loop

[1:48:18] <$RealThiele> King Crimson
[1:48:18] <Louie_Salmon> No, copies of you
[1:48:19] <$dalmek> this is actually already out and pretty cool
[1:48:19] <$Dakuu75> this can't be multiplayer...
[1:48:19] <teflonbilly777> This makes my head hurt
[1:48:19] <+pixelmike> what?
[1:48:21] <pennykettle_> its turn based fps pat
[1:48:21] <+michingmallecho> Speed force?
[1:48:21] <MasterMushin> This is gonna be buggy
[1:48:21] <KingZaffy> That's actually super clever
[1:48:22] <%BinaryFireball> : /
[1:48:22] <%machshop> quake was already in space
[1:48:22] <lwpabloelenano2hc> if this works as i thing it will....seems interesting
[1:48:22] <%spiritofmojave> Looks weird :O
[1:48:23] <Tomschiii> didnt they say it was turn based?
[1:48:24] <indig0bird> OHHHH
[1:48:25] <Siebersboy> this game exists already did they just copy it?
[1:48:25] <%NKOrange> ok u got me interested
[1:48:25] <+michingmallecho> Wally?!
[1:48:25] <+pixelmike> that doesnt make sense
[1:48:25] <+GingerStrawhat> It's frustrating cause they arn't bad games just short of thier full potential
[1:48:25] <hamborgini> this looks like a concept that is almost impossible to communicate in a trailer
[1:48:26] <WyvernsArentDragons> it looks like a duel game, the copies are your past selves
[1:48:26] <+bugz_munny> I am so confused
[1:48:27] <+TylerRich117> They took the 30 seconds of fun concept a bit far!
[1:48:27] <Rabbidbunnyz> isn't there already a game like this that looks worse
[1:48:27] <%TheNommad> My brain hurts watching this
[1:48:27] <cobalt_phoenix_> 4D SHOOTER
[1:48:27] <+historybowler89> @blackbookalpha no talking about bugsnax yet

[1:48:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> wait, not br?
[1:48:28] <+Big_Bossuru> sounds like a moba
[1:48:29] <+Sendaar> Wait wasnt there a game with this EXACT same gimmick at Microsoft that was a completely different game?
[1:48:29] <%ringabal> Super TimeForce was real good
[1:48:29] <Picia000123> I dont get it
[1:48:29] <indig0bird> You kill timeghosts
[1:48:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> this just looks like a shootbang?
[1:48:31] <+MelodyMedley> Turn based shooter?
[1:48:31] <mrjplays2k9> Everyone is tracer
[1:48:32] <Explodincatz> so its a puzzle game
[1:48:33] <%UvBenServed> Time loops in multiplayer would be...interesting
[1:48:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i'm in then
[1:48:34] <$dalmek> there's already a game like this
[1:48:34] <Futurecity10> Looks like shit
[1:48:34] <+NawsCire> uh
[1:48:35] <SirKeigan> I THOUGHT THEY SAID TURN BASED
[1:48:35] <joomooby> LEMNIS
[1:48:35] <+mikesapartment> jerk, cum, repeat
[1:48:36] <DetroitSentai> Jeff Gerstman talked about this some time ago on the bombcast
[1:48:36] <%ClutchRoadagain> God, I most certainly hope for the devs that this is not a multiplayer game
[1:48:36] <Mnemonicjohnny> Hey, I remember this one! It's pretty neat.

[1:48:37] <+michingmallecho> What is this
[1:48:37] <+MeatBomb> I mean, cool.
[1:48:38] <+azraith> I think it's 1v1 where you create ghosts to keep going
[1:48:38] <WakeUpThrow> Not the game I expected, but the premisse is basically the same
[1:48:38] <aerizn> LEMMINGS GATE?
[1:48:38] <SaltyAzteca> I'm interested
[1:48:38] <%spiritofmojave> POG

[2:17:40] <rafaelba93> actually a good deal
[2:17:41] <%Nope80808> @PatStaresAt its the new pc benchmark. People with 2080TI's have been struggling with it.
[2:17:41] <Manmadeawesome> DQ11 is on XBOX

[2:17:47] <MartwyPies> Finally, Witcher 3 on PC
[2:17:47] <+BinaryForest> They don't care if you buy an Xbox, they just want you in their ecosystem
[2:17:47] <%maenos2> OH BOY BATTLETOADS
[2:17:47] <bahble> if you have a lot of money
[2:17:47] <Man_in_the_Red> the box was never the money maker
[2:17:48] <+astrofalcon1> it' s great for pc
[2:17:49] <abuse_of_mousse> i don't play on pc though
[2:17:49] <Misfit_Tempo> that is a separate pass Pat
[2:17:50] <%Deano8817> the idea is that pc useres aren't going to get an xbox anyways, so may as well cater to them
[2:17:51] <+GingerStrawhat> If you want like two hours with chat throw that on
[2:17:51] <xxmagonx> yes
[2:17:52] <boardscanada> their new games are all trash
[2:17:53] <%Agami23> i love the "new way of bullying is to crash planes into other kids houses in flight simulator".
[2:17:54] <+Chosington> gamepass is easily the most value i ever got out of a service
[2:17:54] <+Sarakin2> they get your money either way
[2:17:54] <+lethallunacyx> Well if you have a pc
[2:17:55] <BenjiCake> game pass backup plan
[2:17:56] <FlamingoJazz> Microsoft long con
[2:17:56] <ABigPinkLion> those pc players weren't gonna buy an xbox anyway
[2:17:56] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe I can get The Witcher 3, the most incredible game ever created
[2:17:56] <MegaXZerolegends> Become Netflix
[2:17:57] <JetpackMcQuack> I wish I were 13 with game pass
[2:17:57] <nepwar> hey ill take it
[2:17:57] <%Ipsenscastle> it's a weird strategy
[2:17:57] <+G_Thunders> Has Pat said if he‚Äôs going to pay the Control/Alan Wake DLC?
[2:17:58] <%CrazyRainbows> I mean yeah pretty much
[2:17:58] <+astrofalcon1> pc chads
[2:17:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> transition to Stream only
[2:17:58] <Xelgus> it's great
[2:18:00] <nepwar> once i get a pc
[2:18:01] <%spiritofmojave> Cripple our own console sales for more PC subs LUL
[2:18:02] <KoyaMusa> hey they weren't making money anyways, might as well go all in
[2:18:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> You will play it on your WINDOWS machine though won't you?
[2:18:03] <boardscanada> Battletoads is trash, grounded is trash, Halo is trash, all budget trash
[2:18:03] <%manwithboxonhead> RE7?!?
[2:18:03] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> It's an amazing deal for sure, I'll get it when I get a better PC
[2:18:04] <frontshuv> recurring revenue better than one time console purchase
[2:18:04] <$RealThiele> showing lies
[2:18:04] <+astrofalcon1> keep on winning
[2:18:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> They still win
[2:18:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh hey i was at those rocks in brooklyn a few weeks ago!
[2:18:05] <+Shaggnar> They know that PC people won't come over
[2:18:05] <cheesedburgers> i hope the stream stays silent dont turn the volume back up
[2:18:06] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> THey make shitloads of money on it so they don't need to sell consoles
[2:18:06] <$drfaustisdead> It's the plan to kill The Xbox @PatStaresAt
[2:18:06] <Misfit_Tempo> there is a consoele pass, a pc pass and a combined pass
[2:18:06] <%Piemono> They don't care Pat
[2:18:07] <masterfire23> game pass + pc
[2:18:07] <+theaccursedsinner> pretty sure some of those games are only on xbox game pass on console
[2:18:08] <laserbeaming> I don't care, it's better this way for me
[2:18:08] <Kaendorth> oh, I might get game pass just for age of empires 3
[2:18:08] <fuji_92> pc tho DansGame
[2:18:09] <dizor> I think theyre prepping people to transfer Xbox from a console to a PC service
[2:18:10] <%maenos2> WATCH A TOAD SOIL HIS DIAPER
[2:18:10] <%Deekman> the xbox is the cheaper living room option for those that can't afford the big PC
[2:18:10] <+demon1103> exactly....why im liking Microsoft more than Sony, they bringing things to platform I actually play

[2:18:14] <Tomschiii> they should fix the fcking store, its abysmal
[2:18:14] <+TheotherKristian> They may make more money on gamepass than console sales
[2:18:15] <+tigerfang86> DA CHILD
[2:18:16] <%bhp_99> I feel like they'll focus on that rather than do consoles later on
[2:18:17] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> That could be the point. Microsoft is slowly changeing the console to a comp

[2:19:21] <$floralkami> @patstaresat you realize they are aware the new consoles are JUST becoming PC's, so they are probably gonna push their market into PC more and more

[2:28:55] <teflonbilly777> Ooooooooooooh Elden Ring
[2:28:56] <MechaGoblin> Nier and Elden Ring please
[2:28:56] <ChungusQuest> get hype for Generic & Setpiece
[2:28:56] <AmericanaRed> persona 6
[2:28:57] <LunarRemix> I don't think so
[2:28:57] <+worldbrand> You should skip the next one so that we get Elden Ring sooner, Pat
[2:28:57] <CookieCutter007> OOOOOOOO
[2:28:57] <NDenizen> YOU COULD EVEN IMAGINE IT
[2:28:58] <$floralkami> @delenay it's the same gameplay, but longer
[2:28:58] <$TzarSalad> elden ring in three hours
[2:28:58] <danknugglit> BLOODBORNE 2
[2:28:58] <DrFaustMD> Elden Ring never ever
[2:28:59] <%stovetopism> This rift shit seems so pointless, I CAN JUST WALK OR JUMP THERE
[2:28:59] <Gallhint> Elden ring is vaporware
[2:29:00] <$RealThiele> the same elden ring teaser
[2:29:01] <+justianxix> oooooohhh
[2:29:01] <+bugz_munny> ooof frames
[2:29:01] <dinnydanny777> I feel like nothing is actually happening in the game
[2:29:02] <+Reaverund> Theyre not gonna show elden ring at gamescom
[2:29:04] <+KingOfTheGeats> this award show is a joke as always
[2:29:04] <+BloodyBurney> SAME TRAILER
[2:29:06] <LavaSharknado> damn these guys just died
[2:29:06] <+demon1103> looks like a R&C game....now bring it to PC and you'll have my money, if not see ya in over 5 years or so
[2:29:07] <%Nope80808> Then stop watchin pat
[2:29:07] <ChamoCamouflage> i think y'all just being cynic asses imo
[2:29:07] <dankHadd> elden ring isn't real
[2:29:08] <+MelodyMedley> It's gonna be the one you don't watch
[2:29:08] <nepwar> one day they'll show elden ring and grimm will release his book that same day
[2:29:09] <+KaijuUltimax> The first interesting game and it's the same trailer LUL
[2:29:09] <$Invlux> One of these days Ratchet will fall out of world mid-trailer
[2:29:10] <$drfaustisdead> Yes. One day it will be Elden Ring, and one day it will be Bloodborne 2.
[2:29:10] <+IFlaske> then by not watching elden ring will come sooner
[2:29:10] <%thegreenbenis> FRAME DROPS
[2:29:10] <LunarRemix> Elden Ring will forever be held as bait making people watch it
[2:29:11] <cherrycottontail> Hey this game is okay
[2:29:11] <laserbeaming> and then you can be disappointed when Elden Ring turns out to be a Gacha Game
[2:29:12] <+aeronauticaljon> Bring back Banjo Kazooie you cowards
[2:29:12] <%phantomsleeves> you don‚Äôt KNOW they‚Äôll show elden ring one day

[2:29:26] <+pixelmike> this is literally a replay of a trailer
[2:29:27] <Xeno351> it's going to be like 2 more years before it launches
[2:29:27] <+EySoyCoco> Papa Doritos gave Miyazaki the GOTY but he was left on seen for this event

[2:29:32] <%Hasmeister96> Is Josh Keaton voicing Ratchet?
[2:29:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> BRUH just release a demo, don't make us watch the damn thing
[2:29:33] <+PrometheusDark> This looks like it plays exactly like the original trilogy of Ratchet and Clank what are you lot on about??
[2:29:34] <srcalavera94> i dont remeber wich one but they announce dmc5 once and i came.
[2:29:35] <boardscanada> this is a repeat of the last trailer
[2:29:36] <+brightman42> it's not the same trailer but it is the same demo
[2:29:36] <pillowwasp> IM SO BORED. BE ENTERTAINING PAT
[2:29:37] <+Reaverund> Elden Ring would show up at Tokyo GS if anything
[2:29:37] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt How much better are dumb dogs compared to smart dogs?
[2:29:38] <MechaGoblin> It kinda sounds like they are ignoring the reboot
[2:29:39] <vingadivo> particles are pretty
[2:29:40] <+desfore> @PatStaresAt The characters literally said "After all these years, it's the same plot AGAIN?"
[2:29:40] <Applecannon63> this is the same but uncut?
[2:29:42] <whimsicallifestyle> elmo sleeping
[2:29:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> this looks technically complex
[2:29:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Zundelle Honestly even though this is the same trailer as before, I'm still more interested in it than 90% of what they showed today.
[2:29:42] <%stovetopism> Why do you need the rift? You could just jump there?!
[2:29:43] <+Delenay> its a good thing your gun only hurts bad ppl.... not all those civs in the way
[2:29:44] <martinhadameme> @zundelle Literally been a thing in ratchet and clank since the second game

[2:29:50] <%Dingalow> Miyazaki announces that he is halting production of the Demon's Souls remake and Eldin Ring just for Bloodborne 2
[2:29:51] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> The ai looks horrible lol they just stand there
[2:29:52] <KitsuneManami> Thats how it Goes
[2:29:53] <+pixelmike> ITS THE SAME TRAILER BUT UNCUT
[2:29:53] <Onamar> That's literally just a grappling hook

[2:34:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> God of War gets a free pass because you can jump off the edge and die
[2:34:41] <teflonbilly777> The PS4 squeezes the loads out of Kratos

[3:10:02] <%FoolsArcade> BUT CRABS THO?
[3:10:03] <+astrofalcon1> leaf bugs
[3:10:04] <%ospreyworks> mosqutios
[3:10:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat doesn't understand anthropology.
[3:10:04] <clloudberry> BUT SHRIMP ARE DELICIOUS
[3:10:05] <iamdiosson> Lets,see,what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[3:10:05] <%FutaSnek> DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF SINGUARLITY
[3:10:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @quantras6 i bought all my friends Hentai Battle Royale for 50¬¢ each only to realize there's no multiplayer
[3:10:06] <+NanoComputer> misqitoes.
[3:10:06] <Daxalog> Fuck OFF! You wish you had an Exoskeleton
[3:10:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt U ONLY GET ONE
[3:10:09] <%toolofparanoia> HORNETS FUCK THEM
[3:10:10] <Sorrowful_Suicide> Mosquitos can be erased, screw those things
[3:10:10] <%fairore> we need the bees
[3:10:11] <faithless_zealot> <gasp>
[3:10:13] <%Konquerer> COWARD
[3:10:14] <%Emperor_Machinus> But what about Bees?
[3:10:14] <ScreamLord> And Crabs?
[3:10:15] <%Aeoneth> Don't let Paige hear you say that
[3:10:15] <cureneckbeard> exoskeleton warriors DA NA NA AN NA NAA

[3:10:22] <%phantomsleeves> nah i agree with pat
[3:10:24] <%cervidaequus> No more crab
[3:10:26] <+WizoSavage> Pat would you like an exoskeleton? Look like Skelmo?
[3:10:27] <iswearimjustdandy> The correct answer is mosquitos
[3:10:28] <%happyface699> @emperor_machinus And cubes

[3:10:35] <+chase959> that doesn't include spidres
[3:10:38] <%YakumoYomi> @LiquidDinosaur Because they figured buying up exclusives and putting out BS statements like "We're doing it for the community" was better than making a storefront that was actually competitive (feature-wise)
[3:10:38] <+worldbrand> if you're going to pick a wasp, at least pick one of the ground-nesting yellowjacket species. hornets have obvious aerial nests and are easy to avoid
[3:10:42] <%happyface699> FUCK MOSQUITOS
[3:10:45] <VroomSoon> WutFace
[3:10:46] <madskull456> Crab king will not allow

[3:12:59] <ABigPinkLion> That's just life my dude LUL
[3:13:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @YakumoYomi of course that doesnt account for problems like "we dont want TOXIC COMMUNITIES so we have no forums." You know ive NEVER hung out on the steam forums and i bet there is toxi shit there. but you know what there is also , and what i HAVE partaken of? TROUBLESHOOTING.
[3:13:00] <Psyramics> I think I saw that theory on reddit, cause I had the same disagreement with it
[3:13:03] <%FutaSnek> IT GIVES YOU CANCER
[3:13:03] <StarPupil1> FF3 dawg

[3:13:09] <Zudrag> the light is before pat now
[3:13:11] <%Totally_Not_Toby> light makes right guys
[3:13:19] <indig0bird> "Light bad" isn't "good bad" which is... weird?
[3:13:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @YakumoYomi you need a forum for troubleshooting!
[3:13:28] <%fairore> @weissguard did it ?
[3:13:29] <ChungusQuest> I remember Diablo storyline
[3:13:32] <silverira> light is bad in Dark Souls
[3:13:36] <DianaTheAscian> u know sunlight actually hurts u over your lifetime
[3:13:37] <Psyramics> no one does that dungeon
[3:13:40] <%Aeoneth> That was the plot of the FF2 expansion when it got rereleased on the GBA
[3:13:40] <%BoxNavy> light bad. dark good
[3:13:42] <DianaTheAscian> did*
[3:13:47] <dinnydanny777> I forget why the light is bad in Shadowbringers
[3:13:47] <wibbwobbler> ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD
[3:13:49] <%Agami23> the concept of "the warrior of darkness" was in ff3

[3:13:53] <ABigPinkLion> Neon Genesis: "Whatr if angels bad?!"
[3:13:54] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt Lahabreah's whole SPEECH at the end of 2.0 is about how the light is actually bad.

[3:14:13] <faithless_zealot> He's not wrong
[3:14:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PatStaresAt What if as a promo for Destiny's new expac they made Black Doritos
[3:14:18] <+EmptyPenguin> not to mention that in ff14 they've kinda always said that too much of any element/aether type would be super bad
[3:14:24] <madskull456> if you look in the ancient scrolls of FF its there

[3:23:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 sometimes i wonder, if the movie award shows were invented these days would they be as corrupt and farcical? - Not that those shows arent corrupt or a farce, but like, at least they dont give Best Picture awards to movies that havent come out yet

[3:24:05] <LoneFonte> @ALazo A dark place, the one after this
[3:24:09] <thepowerofpinsol> sounds fine
[3:24:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> wait, i have never seen gameplay before why is she able to do this shit is she psychic
[3:24:10] <%Agami23> @TheHeroAppears last saterday
[3:24:11] <%Hasmeister96> Seems fine, but I would need to hear her talk to be sure
[3:24:12] <%AngriestAngryArtist> sounds good I can hear Elmo lol
[3:24:16] <%CalderGaming> up to three objects. upgrade tree extended
[3:24:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> or is this like, crazy tech
[3:24:17] <rbakervv> check the launch skill tree
[3:24:18] <%realm_forge> @cureneckbeard nice!
[3:24:22] <%Deekman> new launch gives you multiple things to throw
[3:24:26] <+G_Thunders> Look at the ability tree
[3:24:26] <dinnydanny777> @liquiddinosaur I just hope we don't start getting award bait games like the oscar bait movies
[3:24:28] <%t2381> It's a new upgrade.
[3:24:30] <%tattleworm> you can throw your barrier now but you'll need to unlock it
[3:24:46] <$drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt There's also a shield dash as well.
[3:24:47] <$floralkami> is that bigger baby???
[3:24:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 we DO but the system is so fucked that that doesnt even work because its just whatever the "biggest" gmae is
[3:25:10] <$floralkami> yepz thats bigger baby
[3:25:12] <%mckraven> @liquiddinosaur its basically an SCP game where she gets powers after containing them
[3:25:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 if video games were like movies then Hellblade would be the oscar bait
[3:25:20] <%CalderGaming> @LiquidDinosaur she's synchronized with a number of supernatural items that give her powers
[3:25:22] <%FutaSnek> Maaaan this game was so good
[3:25:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @mckraven So she just uses the powers of the objects? that sounds like a egregious violation of containment protocols.
[3:25:38] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Is that bad or good?
[3:25:39] <LoneFonte> time to relearn all this weird mao
[3:25:43] <LoneFonte> map*
[3:25:43] <%DeadCrescendo> DeadCrescendo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hi Pat hope you're all doing well and being happy and healthy
[3:25:43] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:25:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> is she herself an SCP/Object of Power?
[3:25:52] <%YakumoYomi> Hey, @PatStaresAt . When I look at the isthereanydeal page for Control, this stream is at the bottom of the page.
[3:26:01] <Tomschiii> still hate the layout of the building.
[3:26:07] <%M4T1A5> directors office should have a way to the hotline
[3:26:10] <KaiserMario> Pat, have you ever played any Infamous games?
[3:26:12] <%mckraven> @liquiddinosaur she's head of the facility
[3:26:14] <+cylish> Did something happen to subscriptions?
[3:26:15] <rbakervv> up on d-pad
[3:26:16] <heartlesshealer> Paige is absolutely an SCP. The Fragile Miracle
[3:26:20] <Zulrez> where‚Äôs the mustard queen suit pat?
[3:26:28] <%BoxNavy> no-fly zone
[3:26:34] <%FutaSnek> @LiquidDinosaur There was some theory's about her and her brother being the same person who got split into 2 people some how
[3:26:35] <rufus2k2> that suit makes her look super skinny
[3:26:40] <wibbwobbler> shoutout to da homies at Remedy. sam lake holding it down lika g
[3:26:42] <%CalderGaming> lol yeah
[3:26:45] <$drfaustisdead> They also changed the map.
[3:26:50] <+G_Thunders> @liquiddinosaur She has an entity attached to her that gives her powers, then this building made her Director which gave her more powers
[3:26:50] <ToneBacas> the shifts
[3:27:01] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the building is supposed to be annoying as hell. It's in-universe procedural every time
[3:27:01] <%CalderGaming> it's not EVIL it just doesn't care about your human needs or sensibilities
[3:27:03] <+ALazo> You say it like you've never licked the floor.
[3:27:10] <+CelioHogane> Voice too low
[3:27:11] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:27:11] <%Razputin217> The Oldest House
[3:27:12] <%maskofmichael> The building is basically a person
[3:27:15] <%Frost_Quill> It's a not-SCP building the layout is gonna fucking SUCK.
[3:27:19] <%coreyyotto> Voices are a little quiet
[3:27:24] <+lethallylactic> Uh-oh
[3:27:26] <dinnydanny777> I hope it's the Wii Shop hotline
[3:27:27] <cipher758> psychic lady. I heard good things about this game
[3:27:28] <heartlesshealer> Uh-Oh in Foundation
[3:27:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> I've been outside the IRL Oldest House and it fucking spooky. Like, the NSA one that controls all telecomms in America and is built to survive a nuke
[3:27:29] <%VHGS> there's an uh-oh
[3:27:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait who plays darling? it's not lucky yates, is it?
[3:27:33] <%superc37> @patstaresat any chance of turning the game up? its a bit quiet
[3:27:33] <%FutaSnek> YOU DID WHAT
[3:27:34] <Tomschiii> so i have to suffer through an annoying structure because story?
[3:27:38] <%FutaSnek> YOU DUMB SHITS
[3:27:44] <Daxalog> Foundation UH OH's
[3:27:46] <Vohs_Bru> talk to the Borg
[3:27:49] <heartlesshealer> thanks
[3:27:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Like this is basically an actual building, the only real difference is he one here is slightly taller
[3:27:57] <%cvp5127> PUMP IT UP
[3:28:00] <%FutaSnek> WHY WOULD YOU FUCK WITH THE WORLD TREE?
[3:28:00] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:28:04] <penitentpentwitch> That stream delay
[3:28:04] <%croxeye> pat has a menu cooldown :V
[3:28:04] <ChamoCamouflage> sounds good
[3:28:05] <DianaTheAscian> i forget how this game ended
[3:28:09] <SuperChumps> Turn down for what
[3:28:10] <$KnivesEve> is this the steam version or ePiC?
[3:28:11] <heartlesshealer> yeeeeeah
[3:28:13] <%DappercatEsquire> it's not anymore
[3:28:14] <%Razputin217> You opened Yggdrasil?!
[3:28:14] <+strifexfair> can i ask YOU to turn up? let's party man
[3:28:16] <psimon_> It's on steam though
[3:28:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @FutaSnek wait is the building yggdrassil
[3:28:18] <%M4T1A5> It's very good
[3:28:18] <Octocon> bro this game is always too low
[3:28:20] <%Hasmeister96> Isn't Control coming to GOG?
[3:28:21] <%Deekman> easily their best one imo
[3:28:21] <faithless_zealot> Is it, tho?
[3:28:26] <KaiserMario> How about that Ultimate Edition nonsense?
[3:28:27] <%FutaSnek> @LiquidDinosaur Yep
[3:28:29] <%Bt_Robot> CAN'T YOU BUY ON STEAM?
[3:28:29] <+G_Thunders> It‚Äôs on steam now
[3:28:29] <bahble> who cares about that dumbstuff
[3:28:29] <+abrupt_abe> The ultimate edition is some bullshit too
[3:28:31] <%LegendGHT> Do the Max Payne games still hold up?
[3:28:31] <faithless_zealot> It looks not so great at all
[3:28:39] <rufus2k2> I want Remedy to buy back Max Payne since Rockstar ain't fucking using it
[3:28:42] <%DappercatEsquire> Does anyone know if you can transfer your Epic store save to the Steam version?
[3:28:44] <%Deekman> here's a tip to hear Pat's stream better. Turn up your speakers
[3:28:46] <Vohs_Bru> buy it on PS4
[3:28:46] <%twoto858> THE JUKEBOX
[3:28:54] <%M4T1A5> Yes it's the first DLC
[3:28:57] <penitentpentwitch> The Jukebox is randomized levels for endgame
[3:28:57] <dinnydanny777> Go put your records on
[3:28:59] <+ianabstract> The jukebox from the entrance
[3:28:59] <rufus2k2> @LegendGHT I'd say so, 3 has an issue with unskippable cutscenes but probably the tightest gunplay in the series
[3:29:01] <TOONFOOD> Jukebox is challenge room stuff
[3:29:02] <Tomschiii> quantum xyz is my least favorite, then comes this
[3:29:02] <Corvan> wow you can get it on gmg for 27 dollars, thats almost the same price as the season pass on epic lol
[3:29:02] <+G_Thunders> Jukebox was the free DLC
[3:29:03] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> nvm it isn't lucky yates, darling is played by a michael poretta, someone who merely resembles lucky
[3:29:08] <Djinnazz> the Jukebox wa the first DLC
[3:29:08] <cipher758> @rufus2k2 we can only hope man
[3:29:10] <%Deekman> the jukebox got patched in a while a go. It's like mini missions to earn points
[3:29:13] <%tattleworm> that was the free dlc addon, it's kinda neat
[3:29:14] <ChamoCamouflage> other dlc wasn't it?
[3:29:24] <%LegendGHT> Arish's face still looks weird
[3:29:25] <%CalderGaming> @LiquidDinosaur being Finnish, Remedy loves their Norse mythology
[3:29:32] <+meowarco> The Jukebox was an update before the 1st DLC
[3:29:40] <Aydarkzero> thats a very extreme closeup monkaS
[3:29:55] <TheHeroAppears> I hope it plays despacito
[3:29:58] <stolando_florida> is it weird to think that Arish kinda looks like Barney Calhoun
[3:29:58] <$drfaustisdead> Those are for the Expeditions @PatStaresAt It's just a challenge mode.
[3:29:58] <Zombrocom> conversations in this game are so wierd
[3:30:06] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[3:30:15] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> yeah you hear that pat?
[3:30:16] <Aydarkzero> perfect timing for the bork
[3:30:18] <%BubbaRands> Get 'em Gief
[3:30:20] <%LegendGHT> He basically is Barney Calhoun
[3:30:22] <%FutaSnek> Free l c
[3:30:23] <%Manwad> "Father I crave violence!"
[3:30:23] <%GarbageNirvana> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:30:27] <Mechazoic_Era> baby tantrum
[3:30:28] <%nmaten> psaDogchamp
[3:30:29] <%Shonen_hero> psaDogchamp
[3:30:32] <%CalderGaming> the face rigging works better for some mouth sounds than for others
[3:30:36] <%LegendGHT> Play Wonderwall
[3:30:40] <%Movemeister> it kicking off
[3:30:41] <StebTheVee> Why would anyone want to work at the FBC? 100 deaths is just another day in the office.
[3:30:41] <%superc37> is it just me or is the game still really quiet
[3:30:46] <Aydarkzero> i love challenge arenas
[3:30:47] <%Dapper_Cactuar> yeah this was the free DLC
[3:30:50] <+spinalwizard> itsabloodypalace
[3:30:53] <DianaTheAscian> is this the Alan wake one?
[3:30:55] <+meowarco> Free update
[3:30:56] <%Deekman> its a good way to grind levels but overall pointless
[3:31:00] <%BubbaRands> psaDogchamp "tonight we battle" psaWInk
[3:31:00] <ToneBacas> big and strong like Paige
[3:31:00] <%tattleworm> there's a neat outfit you can unlock if you can beat tier 3
[3:31:01] <%YakumoYomi> Mighty Borks psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:31:05] <%BubbaRands> psaWink
[3:31:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Bloody Palace time boys let's go
[3:31:13] <Aydarkzero> Arkham Challenge runs PogChamp
[3:31:16] <LorcaNomad> we just starting?
[3:31:16] <+G_Thunders> You can get a cool outfit, but I don‚Äôt remember anything else about this mode
[3:31:18] <+spinalwizard> TIME!
[3:31:18] <+CelioHogane> @DianaTheAscian no, this is neither of the 2 expansions, this is a mini DLC
[3:31:18] <%FutaSnek> Well this is pretty
[3:31:19] <dinnydanny777> Oh look, Northern Lights
[3:31:22] <$TheCrispyBoi> how are Zangief and Elmo getting along?
[3:31:22] <wibbwobbler> im so mf dumb. i spent so long looking for the jukebox b4 giving up
[3:31:24] <Taranfeeto> is RTX on?
[3:31:27] <rosemon5001> look at our not stargates
[3:31:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LegendGHT only if its the neil cicierega version that combines it with You Spin Me Round
[3:31:34] <%M4T1A5> Yes there is fall damage
[3:31:35] <+CelioHogane> @DianaTheAscian he will be playing Expansion 1 today, wich is NOT the Alan Wake Expansion
[3:31:37] <Vohs_Bru> he will be, if you dont cut his balls off too soon
[3:31:42] <%Hasmeister96> Are we in Jotunheim?
[3:31:45] <DianaTheAscian> @CelioHogane k thx
[3:32:05] <$drfaustisdead> It's red and looks evil.
[3:32:08] <+CelioHogane> EVERYTHING IS CORRUPTED
[3:32:10] <penitentpentwitch> It'll likely be bright red
[3:32:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hmmm, if you were telekinetic and you wanted to pick up a gross object would you still feel the gross texture
[3:32:13] <+CelioHogane> DESTROY THE BUILDING
[3:32:14] <%tattleworm> it'll be obvious when you see it
[3:32:18] <%FutaSnek> Man this setting is OPPRESSIVE AS FUCK
[3:32:30] <dinnydanny777> Is this hell?
[3:32:42] <Tomschiii> man, the lighting is so good
[3:32:44] <%BubbaRands> @Hasmeister96 "lok thu'um"
[3:32:44] <%FutaSnek> No some other dimention
[3:32:51] <penitentpentwitch> He fired, he missed. He fired and missed again.
[3:32:51] <%FutaSnek> Called "The Formation"
[3:32:53] <+CelioHogane> The mind gay conspiracy?
[3:32:54] <rufus2k2> giant black psychic dude!
[3:32:55] <ToneBacas> or Second Sight
[3:32:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Stop talking about Psyops the Mindgate Conspiracy!
[3:32:58] <+lazysaiyajin> GREAT GAME
[3:32:59] <cipher758> at the end she will join the x-men
[3:33:01] <Clowns> Psi Ops is all anyone should think about
[3:33:03] <%tattleworm> whenever anybody mentions psi ops i think about second sight
[3:33:09] <+G_Thunders> Psi Ops was so great
[3:33:16] <%Hasmeister96> Did she just go "suffer me now"?
[3:33:19] <ToneBacas> @tattleworm same
[3:33:31] <+CelioHogane> What a coincidence, riot is releasing PsyOps skins
[3:33:35] <rufus2k2> yo npc helpers got some guns tho
[3:33:36] <+antimagictoxin> I always remember Psi-Ops having awesome Japanese cover art by the KoF artist
[3:33:37] <%CalderGaming> @Hasmeister96 I don't think so
[3:33:40] <%LegendGHT> Second Sight NotLikeThis
[3:33:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 i love every single thing CB yells while brainwashing or #mindbreaking orcs
[3:34:00] <%tattleworm> @ToneBacas i never even played either, i just remember them both coming out at almost the exact same time
[3:34:04] <StebTheVee> Just to be clear, you are killing employees who are possessed, right?
[3:34:09] <%M4T1A5> You will probably want to upgrade your personal mod tier, if you didn't already, the DLCs increase the max
[3:34:29] <%CalderGaming> kill ORB
[3:34:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> who are you fighting
[3:34:34] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Same
[3:34:38] <wibbwobbler> it was so bad on base ps4
[3:34:40] <ToneBacas> @tattleworm huh interesting. and they both feature telekinetic powers
[3:34:42] <%FutaSnek> NOT THE EVIL ORB \
[3:34:52] <+CelioHogane> @StebTheVee Yeah, sadly it's impossible to unposses, they are basically radiated with evil.
[3:34:53] <+tweedler92> octoRB
[3:34:55] <cipher758> evil pat
[3:34:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> like i get this is a arena challenge so i assume there's no context for this fight but who are the human enemies with guns you fight in this
[3:35:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> BORK
[3:35:11] <Tomschiii> so, is the janitor still there? (forget his name and pretty much everything else about the game^^)
[3:35:14] <%LegendGHT> Borf
[3:35:14] <$joylent_blue> YAP
[3:35:15] <%CalderGaming> @LiquidDinosaur agency personnel taken over by the Hiss, a hostile sentient electromagnetic resonance
[3:35:16] <ScreamLord> Baby yell

[3:38:42] <+CelioHogane> "Sir this is a videogame store"
[3:38:42] <%Hasmeister96> That's pretty much what a baby does

[3:39:02] <%bread_assassin> Not a restaurant, but I saw someone do that at like a Verizon.
[3:39:06] <+G_Thunders> This challenge is on a time limit, so you want to complete objectives over killing all the enemies if possible
[3:39:09] <%DensityD> OOPS
[3:39:11] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis flash back to working at a restaurant and this kid did just that because our chicken strips weren't nuggets . Never again

[3:39:40] <cipher758> @celiohogane oh god lol
[3:39:42] <penitentpentwitch> Launch continues to be the most powerful power
[3:39:43] <%DensityD> I love lamp
[3:39:48] <%GarbageNirvana> You know in the old west if you pulled that kinda shit you'd be shot, that's why no one did it backt hen
[3:39:53] <%Hasmeister96> @dinnydanny777 Yes
[3:39:53] <%DensityD> is the handgun an OOPS?
[3:39:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean if your fighting monsters your orgaizatio
[3:39:55] <%Movemeister> Launch is pretty hot
[3:40:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> n's default weapon better be cool
[3:40:03] <%Manwad> love that chromatic aberration smoke
[3:40:12] <cipher758> @hasmeister96 that "give me the sauce" meme
[3:40:15] <%FutaSnek> no sadly
[3:40:24] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Man, when I worked in a kitchen, we had some dudes come in right before closing, send their food back & had us remake it & then told us not to bother & refund it right as we served it to him
[3:40:31] <%BubbaRands> put a mic on him next time
[3:40:39] <%DensityD> he will one day shlorp his own crotch
[3:40:51] <+Estuko> Oh my god, the grab and throw reminds me of Destroy All Humans. It took me a while to remember why it felt familiar to watch LUL
[3:40:52] <%coreyyotto> My sister in law's pug does the same thing
[3:40:54] <%GarbageNirvana> @ItsCaptainDisco I hope you spat in it
[3:41:01] <+aeronauticaljon> @DensityD oh noze WutFace
[3:41:04] <penitentpentwitch> Oof, 10 minutes to beat one island, 15 minutes remain
[3:41:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> just like how in Halo, humans are at war with 8 foot tall lizardmen and the weakest, most bitch-tier enemies are just sentient chimpanzees who can hold a rocket launcher 1-handed, the M6D Pistol better be fucking sick
[3:41:13] <%Hasmeister96> @cipher758 Oh god it had been so long I think I actually erased it from my mind
[3:41:19] <%Movemeister> best use Paige's mic for that one
[3:41:20] <+spinalwizard> TIME!
[3:41:38] <cipher758> @hasmeister96 you are truly blessed
[3:41:42] <%Hasmeister96> !uptime
[3:41:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 41m.
[3:41:45] <%LegendGHT> does this DLC have any like.... story?
[3:41:51] <%M4T1A5> Yes I believe that is the point of fall damage
[3:42:07] <%DeadCrescendo> As a subscriber I was in the Discord but now I'm not on the Discord cause my subscription lapsed how do I get back in sorry to ask
[3:42:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> i want a Halo game to have a scene that emphasizes how grunts are MUCH stronger than humans
[3:42:09] <DianaTheAscian> what ff14 class are u leveling to 80 rn Pat?
[3:42:10] <dinnydanny777> Fall damage is an SCP
[3:42:12] <%GarbageNirvana> There was a snippet at the beginning? Seems like this is mostly a Bloody Palace tho
[3:42:17] <wibbwobbler> ü§î
[3:42:18] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly, this is probably a good warmup for the DLC area. Though it costs you a coin.
[3:42:18] <+G_Thunders> @legendght This was the free non-story DLC, so no not really
[3:42:28] <+aeronauticaljon> So is she like a goku with force powers and a handgun?
[3:42:32] <%Hasmeister96> @cipher758 Thanks
[3:42:49] <MoogleVII> lots of smokes and particulate
[3:42:51] <%DensityD> LUL the bandwidth
[3:42:56] <%GarbageNirvana> It actually hasn't been that bad on my end, surprisingly
[3:42:57] <%Hasmeister96> Is KB + M viable in this game?
[3:43:02] <%M4T1A5> If you think this is bad, you should watch some Escape from Tarkov
[3:43:09] <%DensityD> we need to go to the framerate dimension
[3:43:09] <%LegendGHT> isn't there going to be an alan wake crossover?
[3:43:11] <%BubbaRands> oink oink psaDogchamp
[3:43:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @aeronauticaljon god damn you and you rcomment now i am picturing goku with a gun

[3:44:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Big Succ
[3:44:23] <cipher758> throwin' rocks
[3:44:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Estuko he was? I mean, in DB classic he get shot and it like, knocks him out for a minute or so
[3:44:36] <Pookiedaexzile> @Razputin217 ASS-TEC WarFare
[3:44:46] <+Estuko> @LiquidDinosaur he was in a transformed state too.
[3:45:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Why she so cheeked up in this pants suit
[3:45:24] <penitentpentwitch> Orb mastery has come!
[3:45:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Estuko could I possibly get some mild context? like, what kind of gun, who shot it, what SSJ form he was in/
[3:45:36] <Fro5tburn> he wants the ball Kreygasm
[3:45:43] <cipher758> orb god
[3:45:47] <%happyface699> GIB BALL
[3:45:49] <penitentpentwitch> @Pookiedaexzile It's an unlockable costume Pat equipped
[3:46:11] <%Razputin217> I hate that enemy so much
[3:46:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile This is my first exposure to this game and so far my takeway is like "what if Scully was a Warframe"
[3:46:21] <shurtal> pat decide to do Jukebox instead of Foundation? or just practicing?
[3:46:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh I see he had to work for it
[3:46:32] <+Estuko> @LiquidDinosaur woops was wrong, he was in his base form after beating Golden Frieza, it was a laser beam gun shot by one of his freizas lackeys
[3:46:32] <Vyskus> is that bloodstarved beast
[3:46:37] <$RealThiele> this feels like a destiny level
[3:46:43] <%DappercatEsquire> can you don't
[3:46:54] <%GarbageNirvana> What IF Scully was a Warframe
[3:47:12] <Pookiedaexzile> @LiquidDinosaur As we all know Pantsuits work much the same way as warframes
[3:47:20] <penitentpentwitch> Do not stand in spitting distance in front of Heavy Weapons Hiss
[3:47:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GarbageNirvana well the whole alien pregnancy thing would make more sense, it could be a Helminth thing
[3:47:34] <avidneptune> Jukebox is just challenge arenas so yeah
[3:47:37] <Cosairen> god there are so many visual effects you can barely see the dudes
[3:47:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO IT WAS WHAT IF SCULLY WAS A WARFRAME
[3:47:43] <penitentpentwitch> Mulder would be THRILLED
[3:47:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at Pat protecting them big bucks
[3:47:45] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:47:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Estuko damn that's still pathetic. I always felt bad for the henchmen who are so shit they cant even do ki blasts and need a blaster gun
[3:47:48] <theanora1> This whole thing is timed
[3:47:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> This combat seems noticeably better than the original game.
[3:47:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't cross the streams
[3:47:51] <+aeronauticaljon> Dude X-files. I miss that show
[3:47:54] <%shiplord13> Scully: Mulder nothing supernatural is going on here.
[3:48:16] <$RealThiele> Also Scully: Mulder im gonna stop time for a bit
[3:48:23] <Pookiedaexzile> You want pat to say the W word you gotta get this man some hats
[3:48:30] <penitentpentwitch> Half done, 8 minutes to go
[3:48:36] <%M4T1A5> well second island was only 7 minutes
[3:48:45] <penitentpentwitch> Maybe there's a partial completion reward?
[3:48:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile what? pat talks about warframe
[3:49:03] <+Estuko> @LiquidDinosaur lol
[3:49:05] <+G_Thunders> This is a good refresher for the combat either way
[3:49:07] <%tattleworm> there might also be something else to do after the islands
[3:49:19] <+enternius> Hey doggy
[3:49:25] <%Manwad> elmo knows how to footsies
[3:49:29] <ovan20> Elmo has no chill now LUL
[3:49:32] <cipher758> pet war. war has changed
[3:49:34] <+Estuko> So what's the eal I just noticed the time-limit?
[3:49:34] <%GarbageNirvana> sniff sniff snooooff
[3:49:35] <penitentpentwitch> Elmo practicing footsies with Zangief so he can win against zoners
[3:49:42] <wibbwobbler> i was definitely relate to cats
[3:49:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, this isn't the DLC?
[3:50:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Not the new one
[3:50:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Why she look like she on the way to do a ted talk on turtle necks
[3:50:07] <+CelioHogane> @CommanderSqueaks it's DLC, but not the expansions.
[3:50:10] <penitentpentwitch> @CommanderSqueaks This is a DLC, however it's not a story DLC
[3:50:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is A dlc
[3:50:16] <+gitgouda> whats this game about?
[3:50:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Pants Suits
[3:50:32] <+CelioHogane> @gitgouda SCP
[3:50:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> Who'd win this woman or Emu Farmer with a Shotgun
[3:50:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> SCPs
[3:50:38] <Vyskus> scp pant suits
[3:50:43] <+NanoComputer> Its basically SCP
[3:50:43] <poweruser> creepy pasta
[3:50:51] <%CrookedSpiral> psaWink <3's psaDogchamp
[3:50:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @penitentpentwitch Oh good, I ducked out to take doggo for walk and was worried I missed something.
[3:50:53] <%M4T1A5> boom headshot
[3:50:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @gitgouda its literally Legally Distinct SCP. they arent even trying to hide it
[3:50:57] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur Plague if he was the farmer
[3:51:05] <+aeronauticaljon> Wasn't there suppose to be cool SCP stuff in the game or did they give up on that now?
[3:51:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Its about what if Twlight Zone and Outer limits had a stand user range
[3:51:21] <+gitgouda> lol
[3:51:34] <spongeofmystery> Oh yeah, I'd forgotten Control GOTY edition was out today
[3:51:40] <+gitgouda> triple A scp throws me off
[3:51:40] <%Hasmeister96> You guys ever think about how Mimir, Celebrimbor, and Senator Armstrong all have the same voice actor?
[3:51:47] <wibbwobbler> alanwakewascool
[3:51:47] <TOONFOOD> Did pat get the TV relic?
[3:51:50] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur well, isn't SCP free domain anyway?
[3:51:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's unneeded.
[3:52:00] <%M4T1A5> everything below 5 is basically worthless as the DLCs increased the maximun mod level
[3:52:01] <%Deekman> agreed
[3:52:05] <+G_Thunders> @aeronauticaljon that‚Äôs the entire game, this is just a combat challenge
[3:52:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> what if they made a jojo game and the core gameplay loop is "find the enemy stand user before they kill you, but when yuo find them its instakill"
[3:52:07] <Daxalog> Why?
[3:52:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Just gib guns
[3:52:13] <%Deekman> such a needless addon and makes no fucking sense to the lore
[3:52:21] <penitentpentwitch> The weapon mods are basically enforced grinding
[3:52:27] <+blastazoid26> Yeah mods feel out of place
[3:52:30] <Djinnazz> dissagree
[3:52:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Gib big gun gib little gun, gib gun
[3:52:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> The mods add nothing to the game.
[3:52:33] <penitentpentwitch> They're boring stat ups that don't add much
[3:52:50] <+SinisterBroccoli> I'm going to play dragon's dogma again
[3:52:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CelioHogane i mean yeah but you still couldn't just literally do SCP. it would be a faux pas. Also IIRC there IS Some legal bullshit where like, some russian dude tried to Trademark SCP
[3:52:52] <%Manwad> none of the mods are cool
[3:53:08] <+Estuko> @SinisterBroccoli I'm doing my run too lol, I miss it
[3:53:09] <%tattleworm> you can do some nutty things, like stacking multiple "levitating reduces ammo usage" to give infinite ammo in the air
[3:53:14] <+blastazoid26> I'd rather have weapon proficiency or something else instead
[3:53:14] <Djinnazz> you guys could not be more wrong
[3:53:17] <mellorolo> its just what rarity of red>purple>green?
[3:53:21] <%tattleworm> but that they're totally randomised sucks
[3:53:28] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur and that's why it's not just SCP
[3:53:30] <%coreyyotto> Never saw the point of accuracy
[3:53:37] <%Hasmeister96> 15% concentrated power of will
[3:53:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tattleworm ok do they even try to justify an upgrade like that in lore
[3:53:40] <Pookiedaexzile> "This one will suck your dick in a way that won't shame god's corpse"
[3:53:46] <wibbwobbler> destiny like gear in a single player campaign feels redundant
[3:53:47] <+CelioHogane> @coreyyotto pun intended?
[3:53:48] <penitentpentwitch> It's systems like this that make me quit Borderlands and Destiny 2
[3:54:03] <+geistuser> its better if the weapons lvled up the more you used them
[3:54:05] <%M4T1A5> You need to go to a control point and upgrade your mod level
[3:54:12] <+aeronauticaljon> One mod adds a Chrisma mod +2
[3:54:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CelioHogane also i think if they literally did SCP there would (rightfully) be backlash since its "owned by the community." Also being legally Distinct lets them make this part of the Alan Wake universe
[3:54:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Member when Borderlands got rid of the best character class in B3
[3:54:29] <Pookiedaexzile> I member
[3:54:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Mods are a neat idea, but the system they have in place is so tedious
[3:54:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Pookiedaexzile What is that quote from I must know
[3:54:34] <%tattleworm> @LiquidDinosaur not as far as i can remember. does it need to?
[3:54:36] <mellorolo> @geistuser yeah i agree
[3:54:42] <%M4T1A5> blast radius is good
[3:54:47] <LoneFonte> @Pookiedaexzile wait, who
[3:54:49] <+CelioHogane> Remember when Borderlands 3 decided that FUCK IT, NO CHARACTER DLC
[3:54:53] <+CelioHogane> ONLY FOUR CLASSES
[3:55:17] <%tattleworm> three ammo cost when levitating on the rocket launcher turns you into a gunship
[3:55:22] <%Laecerelius> They should‚Äôve at least made more class trees to compensate
[3:55:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> also in an SCP game who would you be fighting? you need to have humanoid enemies with guns. Would you fight that hippie baptist scientologist cult?
[3:55:32] <%M4T1A5> mind control speed is kinda nice also
[3:55:40] <%astrophizz> the foundation has some great mods
[3:55:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> or guys from that parallel universe that the Foundation accidentally(?) sterilized when they were all dying of a flu?
[3:55:48] <%LegendGHT> fuck Borderlands
[3:55:51] <+aeronauticaljon> Yeah I thought more options in BL3 but no, sad
[3:55:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> I've found that aiming in this game is garbage
[3:55:57] <Pookiedaexzile> gunZerker was best class don't @ me
[3:56:01] <+CelioHogane> No
[3:56:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah
[3:56:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Krieg being back reeks of desperation but im glad he's back
[3:56:04] <%DappercatEsquire> it was ok
[3:56:05] <+CelioHogane> It was not good
[3:56:05] <%BinaryFireball> nope
[3:56:07] <+SinisterBroccoli> just no aim and let auto aim help you out
[3:56:08] <Frogwash> Story shit
[3:56:08] <%coreyyotto> no
[3:56:08] <Futurecity10> it was bad
[3:56:09] <ovan20> it's was OK
[3:56:09] <%bread_assassin> Not really.
[3:56:09] <faithless_zealot> It was Borderlands
[3:56:10] <Vyskus> I liked it
[3:56:11] <DianaTheAscian> for me its really meh
[3:56:12] <$RealThiele> no
[3:56:13] <+Estuko> LUL
[3:56:13] <%cowardman93> it was 100% average
[3:56:14] <cipher758> borders
[3:56:15] <%astrophizz> it's ok
[3:56:15] <%tattleworm> nah
[3:56:15] <%Manwad> story was ass
[3:56:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Bailey__gaming but Krieg is good
[3:56:16] <%Bailey__gaming> it played well but everything else was popp
[3:56:16] <Mechazoic_Era> meh
[3:56:20] <ChamoCamouflage> Good gameplay, shit storiy?
[3:56:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Borderlands 3 is fine.
[3:56:22] <+aeronauticaljon> Its fun but not enough classes
[3:56:22] <%astrophizz> it's more of 2
[3:56:23] <%l3sovikk> The class design and gameplay were good. But the story and writing sucks ass
[3:56:24] <koffeemancer> gun shoot bang ok, story bad @PatStaresAt
[3:56:25] <%AncelDeLambert> ah fuck not another one of these fat assholes
[3:56:25] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur i mean, the enemy would STILL be the Hiss, you don't need to use an already existing SCP.
[3:56:26] <ovan20> chat, borderlands story was always shit
[3:56:26] <Thetruestblacksun> Okay
[3:56:28] <Tooniearcade> Gameplay good. Story shit
[3:56:29] <$galaxyswirl> it was good, not great but good
[3:56:32] <%Manwad> and I personally didn't like any of the builds because none were Gaige
[3:56:32] <Sunstalker> Boring mostly, also lot of balancing needed. I saw people explain entire skill trees not working or not being worht it
[3:56:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's not good or bad, it's just ok
[3:56:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Bailey__gaming did they ever adress whether Kreig is Tina's dad
[3:56:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate how the end of the last game is just a gauntlet of three of those pricks
[3:56:42] <%Bailey__gaming> it felt good to shoot the gun and stuff but
[3:56:43] <Djinnazz> Gameplay is good, story is hot dog shit.
[3:56:43] <penitentpentwitch> Borderlands 3 was meh. Writing grates like steel wool pretty quickly.
[3:56:46] <%GarbageNirvana> it was old terrible BL writing and they didn't do enough to really push the formula forward
[3:56:50] <$RealThiele> the only reason borderlands 2 was good was because they stole the money from Alien to help dev it. BL3 had no such slush fund
[3:56:52] <+CelioHogane> @ovan20 except Tales from Borderlands
[3:56:54] <%CrookedSpiral> This game has really shiny rocks
[3:56:57] <wibbwobbler> never touched a borderlands
[3:56:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Class Design Wack, The Waifu bait Wack, the Story Wack, Borderlands 2, that was cringe as fuck but I was like 12
[3:56:58] <%Aleate> Borderlands 3 felt too much like "Hello fellow kids"
[3:57:02] <%Laecerelius> The only good thing about the story was I legitimately hated the antagonists
[3:57:04] <Fro5tburn> did they ever boost mech's damage?
[3:57:04] <%AncelDeLambert> "last game" main game, dumb brain, work right
[3:57:17] <ovan20> @CelioHogane that was good, but not made by gearbox :P
[3:57:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CelioHogane ehh.... the problem is that you'd have to just play normal guns man in a MTF. you cant have agents just using superpowers in SCP. they tried that shit with Abel and that was the darkest and most stupid era of SCP history
[3:57:20] <+CelioHogane> @CrookedSpiral they are actually shiny rocks.
[3:57:20] <mellorolo> Borderlands 3 seems like a topic for outrage
[3:57:24] <%Bailey__gaming> @LiquidDinosaur nope, he's just in the new DLC you go in his brain. i wonder how he will take THAT death
[3:57:26] <%DappercatEsquire> I feel like the novelty of a shooter looter is no longer there, so the flaws are a lot more obvious
[3:57:40] <%M4T1A5> it's literally just damage though
[3:57:45] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur just play as the girl of the photo powers.
[3:57:51] <$RealThiele> BL3 is less outrage and more boring grindy nonsense
[3:57:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Borderlands 3 pushed Boderlands 2's worst parts to the forefront
[3:57:57] <+aeronauticaljon> Well Gearbox already killed Aliens so ...
[3:57:58] <%lisnot> lisnot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! never get to make it for any streems. Glad I'm here for control with no context. btw what car did peach get, it looks like a mini?
[3:58:07] <%Manwad> I miss Anarchy Gaige
[3:58:15] <Aydarkzero> whoops
[3:58:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DappercatEsquire I think the quirky writing of the first two also helped people look tolerate some of the grindy, boring parts inherent in shlooters, so once you take that away they become even more glaring.
[3:58:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CelioHogane wait which one is that?
[3:58:29] <$RealThiele> Moze mech lasts all of 2 seconds on harder modes
[3:58:29] <%Bailey__gaming> Anarchy Gaige was p good
[3:58:35] <penitentpentwitch> For all its flaws, I prefer Warframe's consistent weapon stats compared to other looter shooters. (And dislike Kuva Weapons).
[3:58:52] <Pookiedaexzile> I miss Gunzerker go Brrrrrrrr
[3:58:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CelioHogane also i was thinking about SCP 682 and isnt he basically just a Tarrasque
[3:58:53] <%CrookedSpiral> @CelioHogane got it. I've never seen this game before lol
[3:58:57] <wibbwobbler> wat about the billions of guns or whatever
[3:58:58] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur i don't remember, but basically it's the one that almost got free but they figured out that someone was lying about her losing her powers
[3:59:06] <%Bailey__gaming> I liked FL4K a lot but they just nerfed him INTO the floor and i got sick of it so i quit
[3:59:15] <%DappercatEsquire> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah, there was a certain momentum to Borderlands 1 and 2's story, and Handsome Jack was pretty charming. BL3 just has some assholes I don't care about, being assholes.
[3:59:18] <%M4T1A5> -projectile spread and more projectiles is pretty good for the shotgun
[3:59:23] <$RealThiele> flak pets always felt super weak
[3:59:26] <Fro5tburn> man I sorta want to try warframe again, but my years old account has missed so much content that I have no idea what I'm doing when I go back in
[3:59:31] <Djinnazz> FAILED.
[3:59:40] <penitentpentwitch> -1 Jukebox Coin
[3:59:48] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt What happens when Zangief gets do dependent on your hugs/carries and ends up trying to jump in your arms when it gets big and swole?
[3:59:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wow Pat
[3:59:54] <%CrookedSpiral> time run out?
[3:59:54] <mellorolo> lazy rolls of nice x)
[3:59:55] <+CelioHogane> yes
[3:59:59] <QuaiRolDor> MISSION FAILED
[4:00:03] <%Kiiper> @Fro5tburn Finish the starmap, then do new things
[4:00:08] <+aeronauticaljon> @Bailey__gaming Dude Flak was my primary, then my friends would wipe the map without me
[4:00:09] <@SoFarFetched> Paige would probably die
[4:00:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Lift
[4:00:13] <rufus2k2> GUESS I'LL DIE
[4:00:14] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat will become stronger to tank those dog hits
[4:00:16] <%miguelrod777> Paige will die
[4:00:16] <$RealThiele> ass crusher
[4:00:18] <penitentpentwitch> Pat will fall over, Paige will get pancaked
[4:00:18] <%cowardman93> Pat will be forced to start lifting
[4:00:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat must get muscle Power to love Zangief
[4:00:22] <%toolofparanoia> PAT BREAKS AT ZANGIEF
[4:00:22] <QuaiRolDor> what happened to elmo??
[4:00:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> ELEVATORS ARE FOR BITCHES
[4:00:35] <rufus2k2> Paige's bones will pre-shatter to cushion the impact
[4:00:36] <cipher758> it will be a perfect K.O.
[4:00:37] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur I think she was on the uhhh Superpowered team they had but went "yeah let's not..."
[4:00:40] <%CrookedSpiral> like a medicine ball with legs
[4:00:42] <%miguelrod777> Paige won't have the health pool to survive a zangeif tackle
[4:00:45] <%cowardman93> SPEEN
[4:00:48] <%M4T1A5> You probably want to upgrade mod level
[4:00:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire there i a big momentum killer in Borderlands 2. After Angel and Roland die and Jack is going to the Vault, you should go to the Vault and end the game. But instead you need to go to the desert map to find the map leading to the Vault. you should have already done that map for some other reason
[4:00:52] <Vex_Machina> SPEEEEEEEEEEEN
[4:01:05] <%Deekman> leave the suit
[4:01:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah Pants Suit
[4:01:05] <LoneFonte> @Fro5tburn usually I go "alright this looks cool, what event do I need to grind/ unlock to get that/there" and wiki dive
[4:01:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> A lot of the outfits are good.
[4:01:07] <%gespenst25> that is pretty cool
[4:01:08] <+CelioHogane> PAIGE SUIT
[4:01:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Nah, stick with Director
[4:01:08] <Aydarkzero> A-Synch looks rad
[4:01:09] <%MillaMoks> Id say async suit
[4:01:10] <%maskofmichael> Be The Sith Lord
[4:01:10] <+SinisterBroccoli> did you see that new chocobo carriage?
[4:01:11] <tactician0> he'll crush paiges ribcage one day
[4:01:12] <%LegendGHT> Golden suit!
[4:01:12] <wibbwobbler> sure!
[4:01:12] <rufus2k2> yuck
[4:01:12] <+ianabstract> mustard mode

[4:01:15] <+Estuko> Mustard Suit
[4:01:15] <rufus2k2> Mustard!
[4:01:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Janitor's Assistant!

[4:01:17] <ovan20> everything is meh
[4:01:18] <indig0bird> Ew
[4:01:18] <+scrumbotime> Janitor
[4:01:19] <%toolofparanoia> A-SYNCH
[4:01:19] <%SomeSageAdvice> Async is cool
[4:01:20] <%cowardman93> asynchronous looks fucking hype
[4:01:21] <%miguelrod777> janitor
[4:01:21] <$RealThiele> piss director
[4:01:21] <%superc37> LONG COAT
[4:01:24] <ivanmistwalker> Async
[4:01:24] <bearking05> mustard
[4:01:26] <%mike2hands> Janitor
[4:01:27] <%Movemeister> Mustard queen
[4:01:27] <LoneFonte> MUSTARD
[4:01:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait
[4:01:28] <+blastazoid26> GOLD
[4:01:28] <Xelgus> she looks like a sith
[4:01:30] <%weissguard> Asynchronous looks really nice.
[4:01:30] <rufus2k2> async is Jedi as fuck
[4:01:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire its like how in Bioshock 1 after the Big Reveal your all ready to go kill Fontaine but no you gotta go find the potions that will break your mental conditioning that's giving you a heart attack
[4:01:31] <psimon_> I like the tactical one
[4:01:31] <cureneckbeard> mustard
[4:01:31] <%cowardman93> however mustard suit does turn her into Paige
[4:01:31] <+Rachet20> Golden is best
[4:01:32] <indig0bird> Director or Asynchronous
[4:01:35] <heartlesshealer> they're all good
[4:01:36] <penitentpentwitch> Matrix clothing is go
[4:01:37] <+aeronauticaljon> Is teh Golden suit a H.P. Lovecraft reference?
[4:01:39] <%gespenst25> God I would wear that suit IRL.
[4:01:48] <Pookiedaexzile> I wish star wars would just stay dead already
[4:01:50] <QuaiRolDor> Hey @PatStaresAt i havent been here for a while is elmo okay?
[4:01:54] <+CelioHogane> @aeronauticaljon very likelly
[4:01:57] <%Hasmeister96> @aeronauticaljon For the Yellow King?
[4:02:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gespenst25 I'd be terrified of getting caught in doorways.
[4:02:05] <+CelioHogane> @QuaiRolDor he is sleeping on the bathroom
[4:02:08] <$RealThiele> star wars is fine in animation, but live action can go away
[4:02:09] <heartlesshealer> pat
[4:02:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> woolieONEGUY
[4:02:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 Hastur's in this?
[4:02:30] <%Hasmeister96> So DC's problem?
[4:02:33] <QuaiRolDor> @CelioHogane okay so long as he is still okay
[4:02:36] <%tattleworm> tommasi fight's a pain in the ass, wouldn't worry about it
[4:02:38] <pistofficer> quarry area looks so dope
[4:02:38] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur Ah jeez I forgot all about that. Nevermind Borderlands stories are bad and saved by virtue of sometimes not irritating characters. I fell of Borderlands 3 and I'm having trouble putting my finger on why, I think it all just felt so mediocre.
[4:02:38] <heartlesshealer> if you wanna
[4:02:41] <$RealThiele> yea pmuch
[4:02:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 i thought he was busy controlling all government and big businesses in Louisana
[4:02:44] <ChamoCamouflage> na
[4:02:47] <+CelioHogane> @QuaiRolDor Yes he is VERY fine
[4:02:51] <%Deekman> tomassi fight is easy as fuck
[4:02:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Star wars was never good. It had like 4 good ideas and 60 comics that explored them
[4:02:52] <Pookiedaexzile> its over
[4:02:53] <+aeronauticaljon> Don't eat the doggo
[4:02:58] <%Deekman> you're so over powered at this point
[4:03:01] <$RealThiele> she is infecting him with mold
[4:03:05] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur I don't know. This is honestly the first I'm seeing this game
[4:03:05] <%Manwad> i fucking love the design of this place
[4:03:07] <heartlesshealer> sounds good
[4:03:07] <$drfaustisdead> Yggdrasil.
[4:03:14] <%crimsonharvest> Where's that blue dwarf guy to upgrade your axe
[4:03:16] <+blastazoid26> Is paige eating the dog again?
[4:03:24] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Pat, is there anything that they showed off today that you think looks interesting?
[4:03:25] <heartlesshealer> god I missed that label shit
[4:03:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire ultimately its not a great series. I liked Borderlands 2 because Jack is a good villain and also like, all of my friends in college that semester were playing it too
[4:03:26] <%DappercatEsquire> But imagine if all the text was comic sans
[4:03:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Bruh
[4:03:29] <penitentpentwitch> It just slaps you with the area name
[4:03:32] <mellorolo> star wars another topic for outrage
[4:03:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> I always felt like that was Polaris TELLING Jesse what the place was called.
[4:03:36] <LoneFonte> never fails
[4:03:42] <%Deekman> put cube in hole
[4:03:44] <%M4T1A5> put battery into machine
[4:03:47] <$drfaustisdead> there's a giant glowing cube behind you pat
[4:03:48] <+CelioHogane> Pat...
[4:03:48] <$RealThiele> do they pay nolan for those intros? LUL
[4:03:51] <%cowardman93> cube
[4:03:52] <%Skittlesoul> HONK
[4:04:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> How could Pat have ever forgotten about CUBE!?
[4:04:04] <%twoto858> Every puzzle in this game is a variation of "put cube into hole"
[4:04:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who are you fake Pat?
[4:04:05] <Pookiedaexzile> That's like your whole thing
[4:04:05] <penitentpentwitch> Pat has Orbed too long, he forgot about Cubes
[4:04:08] <%maskofmichael> Next Bit
[4:04:09] <%weissguard> Looks great.
[4:04:11] <heartlesshealer> at least there weren't enemies to distract you from the reminder cube
[4:04:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> how do you get new outfits in control?
[4:04:13] <%cowardman93> looks big smooth
[4:04:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Compliments to the stream chef
[4:04:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire and i remember how NG is fun. NG+ is a good challenge. And NG++ is fucking awful "hope you have some 100% optimized build because we're speifically making it impossible to kill even a single enemy if you dont slag them"
[4:04:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Friendship with cube OVER, Orb is new best friend.
[4:04:27] <heartlesshealer> oh boy they are just -growing-
[4:04:34] <$RealThiele> Air Conditioning fixes playing ability
[4:04:39] <mellorolo> lets talk about the great almighty cube
[4:04:42] <LoneFonte> @SinisterBroccoli story points or specific side quests
[4:04:45] <%gespenst25> @CommanderSqueaks some fashion is worth the risk IMO. I already get jeans belt loops caught on door handles, dresses trapped in things... I'll take my chances. :P
[4:04:53] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur I haven't watched season 1 of True Detective yet, sorry
[4:04:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CommanderSqueaks i mean the thesis of Destiny's story is literally circles are good and triangles are bad
[4:05:00] <wibbwobbler> jealous rn of your buttery smooth framerate
[4:05:02] <Pookiedaexzile> I thought his whole thing was killing super man
[4:05:04] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur Never did NG+ because I knew the only thing waiting for me was bullet sponges, which is just not fun.
[4:05:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Also what if Superman was shorter than Lex Luthor
[4:05:19] <$RealThiele> the foundation to kill Superman
[4:05:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oooooooo, new Director lore.
[4:05:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game does good lore.
[4:05:36] <penitentpentwitch> Nepotism sucks for many people
[4:05:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RealThiele that exists its called Project Cadmus
[4:05:42] <heartlesshealer> looks like a huge scar
[4:06:07] <$drfaustisdead> This DLC is packed with lore.
[4:06:14] <LoneFonte> hopefully we get more Max Payne monologues
[4:06:16] <spongeofmystery> I'm gonna scoot because I just bought this and don't want to spoil anything
[4:06:30] <penitentpentwitch> Oh yeah, the Cat sidequest is in this too
[4:06:30] <$drfaustisdead> It looks like the cave opening in Things Betwixt in DS2.
[4:06:31] <$RealThiele> neato
[4:06:33] <Pookiedaexzile> I can see that Ar tho
[4:06:37] <Pookiedaexzile> She backin that thang
[4:06:38] <%DensityD> I'm not stupid
[4:06:40] <+G_Thunders> This lady is an ex-CIA badass who‚Äôs been working here for awhile if you don‚Äôt remember
[4:06:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire this was years ago so i might be completely wrong, but IIRC NG+ was perfectly fine, it was NG++ that was fucking awful bullet sponge hell. when you start it a popup is literally like "oh btw we buffed slag in this mode because you need it" and that sounds to me like they playtested it and it really was too hardcore but instead of sligtly tuning the numbers down they just buffed slag, making slag mandatory in all builds
[4:06:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> Which is bad
[4:06:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Marshall legitimately the most level-headed and capable person in the entire organization?
[4:07:08] <heartlesshealer> that's not good
[4:07:19] <heartlesshealer> also yeah Marshall probably is
[4:07:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait is this story now?
[4:07:24] <wibbwobbler> crushing on Jesse rn
[4:07:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> where is thi cave
[4:07:34] <$floralkami> okay, glad that is cleared up.
[4:07:35] <StebTheVee> she died? when?
[4:07:38] <%maskofmichael> I don't remember that phone lady, who was she?
[4:07:43] <heartlesshealer> we are now in the Foundation area
[4:07:47] <+CelioHogane> @LiquidDinosaur yes
[4:07:54] <%CalderGaming> @LiquidDinosaur this is Underneath
[4:08:02] <SpaceGuntank> chief of security i think, you met hear early.
[4:08:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> F
[4:08:09] <penitentpentwitch> @maskofmichael She showed up briefly in the main story and disappeared. She's the star of this DLC
[4:08:14] <+Byronic_dreamer> @commandersqueaks sure seems that way
[4:08:14] <mellorolo> why would you kill the enigmatic figure In your story
[4:08:15] <%cowardman93> clearly you need timestop
[4:08:24] <heartlesshealer> yeah she's the security lady
[4:08:36] <$drfaustisdead> Yeah she was Trenche's head of security.
[4:08:36] <%cowardman93> man this game always makes me so uneasy
[4:08:42] <Pookiedaexzile> If you really think about it Time stop and cum stop are the same power
[4:08:43] <+kawachipto> Death Stranding now PogChamp
[4:08:46] <Chaoko99> oof
[4:08:50] <heartlesshealer> pat it had the shield up
[4:08:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur Mostly stuck with Borderlands casually for the progression and some neat guns, so that sounds kinda awful
[4:08:59] <%M4T1A5> Your shatter is pretty low damage
[4:09:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> He is GamerDog
[4:09:03] <%cowardman93> cause colours
[4:09:04] <heartlesshealer> pierce is good
[4:09:12] <penitentpentwitch> Grip and Pierce are my favorites
[4:09:25] <%toolofparanoia> ZANGIEF WANNA BE AN SCP
[4:09:27] <heartlesshealer> learning <3
[4:09:28] <+aeronauticaljon> @kawachipto Destiny Shadowgate
[4:09:31] <%CalderGaming> the explosive mode becomes very useful here as well
[4:09:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Has he learned his food word
[4:09:40] <rosemon5001> but pierce sacraficed himself to save chris Kappa
[4:09:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire i kind almost see the appeal of the basic concept o Destiny, since is like "what if Halo gameplay but the addictive pseudo-satisfaction of a loot treadmill"
[4:09:42] <Vohs_Bru> Pierce Brosnan
[4:09:56] <Djinnazz> yeah,this ones a good few hours.
[4:09:59] <$drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt Protip you can grab the rockets you fire from charge and redirect them.
[4:10:00] <TOONFOOD> Pierce more-gun
[4:10:00] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[4:10:12] <Ner234> wow D:
[4:10:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> t seeing a pantsuited Scully-clone airdashing is just, really really silly
[4:10:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Why these eldritch horros pulling up on you wit the stick
[4:10:39] <%maskofmichael> More like a Sith
[4:10:39] <Ell1ot> Is Doggie too stumpy to use the stairs?
[4:10:44] <%octavian_gish> octavian_gish subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! congrats Pat, I'm using my subs of yours to track how long I've been in quarantine!
[4:10:45] <penitentpentwitch> Bonfire Lit
[4:10:49] <heartlesshealer> just whip a rock at 'em real quick. Looks dope
[4:10:57] <spongeofmystery> God that outfit is so cool
[4:11:03] <%CrookedSpiral> down takes time
[4:11:08] <%Manwad> stumpo
[4:11:15] <waltzqueen> esseJ
[4:11:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> What if the Jedi raised a padawan to not have any understanding or concept of death so they could use offensive force powers without fear of them turning evil
[4:11:19] <QuaiRolDor> +
[4:11:24] <cipher758> big stumpo
[4:11:25] <xanderfist> Pat what are you playing?
[4:11:26] <%Laecerelius> Stumpup
[4:11:27] <heartlesshealer> yeah, downstairs moving needs more growth first
[4:11:31] <+scrumbotime> Bulldogs have those POWERFUL BODIES that can fling them UP but down is hard
[4:11:33] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur That's pretty much what it is, and I have no problems conceding that I like to watch number go up.
[4:11:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit its the Furtive Pymy
[4:12:01] <+aeronauticaljon> Anyone getting a Nessus feeling here?
[4:12:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire i played destiny 2's campaign but stopped there. one day i might pick it up again, maybe
[4:12:22] <%crimsonharvest> its probably just the Norns? Since you had to go thru a world tree related thing to get here
[4:12:23] <mellorolo> was it you Pat who talked about fighting with rocks as a child?
[4:12:27] <RogueMinja> I'm assuming aliens.
[4:12:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire i was very, very satisfied when standing out of vover in that one mission does mail a kill message saying "killed by: The Sun"
[4:12:31] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Did Pat finish Ghost of Tsushima?
[4:12:35] <+Byronic_dreamer> Groundslam is my big favorite
[4:12:42] <LoneFonte> @aeronauticaljon all it's missing are the blocky rocks
[4:12:42] <ape_hawk> hey pat, whats up?
[4:12:49] <+CelioHogane> @ItsCaptainDisco Not in stream
[4:12:56] <heartlesshealer> good job
[4:12:58] <ToneBacas> this Hiss isn't... picky
[4:13:03] <+aeronauticaljon> @LoneFonte lol
[4:13:15] <Vohs_Bru> I dont like handgun sounds its almost public domain level
[4:13:16] <pistofficer> did you guys find the meele upgrades ever worth it?
[4:13:20] <heartlesshealer> RNG is RNG
[4:13:20] <$drfaustisdead> Yeah the mod drops not scaling is a bummer.
[4:13:30] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @celiohogane Thank you!
[4:13:42] <ToneBacas> @pistofficer only if you want to get up close and die Keepo
[4:13:45] <%astrophizz> level 6 mods are nice though
[4:13:45] <DrozZombie> Pat i wanna pet your dog untell he farts and falls asleep
[4:13:54] <xanderfist> is she a Jedi?
[4:14:13] <dinnydanny777> There was a platform up there
[4:14:14] <+CelioHogane> @xanderfist no, she is an Esper
[4:14:20] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur I went through the Y1 campaign and DLC when they gave the base game out on Humble, then dropped it after Shadowkeep. If you go in and don't expect it to be a big forever game, I think you'll get a good amount of fun out of it.
[4:14:21] <+aeronauticaljon> @xanderfist nah goku with gun
[4:14:28] <pistofficer> @ToneBacas thats what i thought. i got so stuck in the final fight on the base game. Melee seemned like a suicide run
[4:14:36] <%astrophizz> needs upgraded to go up there as I recall
[4:14:39] <heartlesshealer> well, she absorbed the abilities of a bunch of SCP's to become a jedi
[4:14:39] <%CalderGaming> BIG LOST
[4:14:54] <RogueMinja> That or Also Magneto.
[4:14:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire would i be able to do the dungeon where you fight the cabal guy who's basically Hedonism Bot with eunuch bodyguards?
[4:14:57] <%juxtest> Foundation? More like Lostdation
[4:15:28] <%Savages4Blood> @patstaresat so I'm not very far in this game yet. I am enjoying it alot but having a real hard time navigating the map with all its floors and stuff. did you? if so, does it get better lol
[4:15:35] <%toolofparanoia> Fuck you Barry
[4:15:36] <Vohs_Bru> Pat please play Bug Island instead
[4:15:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> iron smoke! dont breath this!
[4:15:42] <+scrumbotime> I like the idea that early days they just, had their fucking OFFICIES in CAVES.
[4:15:44] <$drfaustisdead> God I love that Northmore was turned into the House's generator.
[4:15:47] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur no that's going into the disney vault
[4:15:54] <$drfaustisdead> Also the map use to be worse.
[4:15:55] <%SneakTheBeak> SneakTheBeak subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM!!!
[4:15:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire fuck
[4:16:02] <%astrophizz> they did tweak the main nap
[4:16:06] <%astrophizz> *map
[4:16:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire can you change your look? i think i picked shitty hair i regret
[4:16:19] <ToneBacas> fungi are weird, man
[4:16:23] <+scrumbotime> Don't eat the mold no matter HOW delicious it is
[4:16:33] <%toolofparanoia> Metamucyte Paige
[4:16:47] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Wow, over two years huh? Enjoying this not quite xfiles game with my new cat, Bootsie taking a nap beside me. He is my big strong baby boy adn i love him
[4:16:57] <+aeronauticaljon> No not the red shirts
[4:16:58] <DrozZombie> they need D-class yo
[4:17:00] <heartlesshealer> "Hey, we need a department of people who signed up for this shit"
[4:17:09] <mellorolo> me furiously scribbling:" Dont eat.. the mold". Got it
[4:17:13] <%Savages4Blood> I'm really pumped to see what they do with alan wake in A.W.E.
[4:17:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> I bet on breaks people would go jerk off in the Eyeball Cave for exibitionism points
[4:17:19] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur I don't think so, but I was a roboman that always wore helmets
[4:17:20] <$Wnds> this looks like a destiny level
[4:17:32] <xanderfist> welcome to the void
[4:17:42] <heartlesshealer> oops
[4:17:42] <%Frostydough1> is that the fucking thought elevator from fucking Code Geass???
[4:17:42] <$drfaustisdead> @Savages4Blood I started AWE and it's really good.
[4:17:44] <%toolofparanoia> Just take lifers from the prisons
[4:17:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DappercatEsquire i actually played the campaign twice, once i was a roboman and once i was a blue person
[4:17:50] <%komradedog> Looks just like Nessus from Destiny 2
[4:17:54] <%CalderGaming> Struggling
[4:18:04] <tactician0> good job
[4:18:18] <+aeronauticaljon> If I see a Vex looking enemy, I'm DONE
[4:18:27] <xanderfist> yea Nessus and Vex architecture
[4:18:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> this map is just the Simaris' Sanctuary
[4:18:31] <heartlesshealer> take out shield boys
[4:18:32] <waltzqueen> MORTIS
[4:18:35] <%toolofparanoia> The 9 need to fuck off
[4:18:40] <%DappercatEsquire> @LiquidDinosaur I stuck with robo warlock the whole time. I think Destiny 2 is best played casually, so I never put time into make other characters.
[4:18:43] <heartlesshealer> he's probably just tired
[4:18:52] <%superc37> man yall are really stuck up on destiny huh
[4:18:57] <DrozZombie> i want to boop him
[4:18:59] <%Savages4Blood> @drfaustisdead yea I'm excited for it. nowhere near where I can play it, but alan wake was a favorite of mine. so I'm excited to see what is said about it
[4:19:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> man i havent played Warframe in a grip but i fucking love Simaris. It's like, what if Braniac , but your goals and his just happened to align so he's your "friend"
[4:19:27] <%toolofparanoia> i still play it
[4:19:33] <%CalderGaming> need a new ability
[4:19:41] <penitentpentwitch> Is the Alan Wake IP 'free' for a sequel or is it tied up by any red tape atm?
[4:19:46] <%CalderGaming> I'm saying this because I wasted too much time on that
[4:19:47] <%superc37> GOOD
[4:19:50] <%CrookedSpiral> RIP Shellmo
[4:19:50] <%toolofparanoia> but it gets boring a lot and i give up after a time
[4:19:52] <heartlesshealer> oh noooo
[4:19:53] <+aeronauticaljon> @DappercatEsquire Very true, just sticking to a Titan for now
[4:19:55] <Pookiedaexzile> @LiquidDinosaur Thats a thing in the future of DC
[4:20:00] <heartlesshealer> I thought shellmo was sleep buddy ; ;
[4:20:04] <Pookiedaexzile> theres a young Brainic whose chill
[4:20:05] <Dao_Puppy> How can you kil that which is already dead?
[4:20:12] <$drfaustisdead> @penitentpentwitch Remedy owns the rights to Alan Wake again.
[4:20:17] <%BinaryFireball> will shellmo be replaced with a long furby?
[4:20:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile what is? Simaris?
[4:20:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Shelmo walked so Geif could waddle
[4:20:26] <Ell1ot> Didn't Shellmo used to live under the couch?
[4:20:27] <$drfaustisdead> So yes they could make a sequel finally.
[4:20:30] <DrozZombie> one day you come out and puppy just flys out its chest
[4:20:35] <LoneFonte> Simaris is from Warframe
[4:20:43] <$drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt you have no idea.
[4:20:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> yes but this map looksl ike his computer simulation you do practice stuff in
[4:20:55] <penitentpentwitch> This DLC is a few hours long, a bit more if you do the Sidequests
[4:21:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> perfectly angular blocks floating in nothing
[4:21:04] <transporterthesequel> Pat and Paige: Lets buy a bunch of expensive toys for Gief! Gief: LOL SHELLMO THO
[4:21:14] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[4:21:16] <%Frostydough1> DO YOU THINK ME A WEEB TENNO
[4:21:19] <+aeronauticaljon> @DrozZombie grows up and eats everyone yep
[4:21:27] <%DappercatEsquire> @DappercatEsquire It's to the detriment of all the "this is my forever game" types, but it just doesn't have enough going on to get invested in before it boils down to "make number go up."
[4:21:32] <avidneptune> White health bar means guns no worky
[4:21:41] <+Byronic_dreamer> Use shield @patstaresat
[4:21:47] <%Laecerelius> Gotta scan those anime titties, Tenno!
[4:22:05] <heartlesshealer> probably tallest rock had an enemy
[4:22:12] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity is having its revengance on Pat
[4:22:26] <TheMorilo> shield is your friend
[4:22:29] <$drfaustisdead> Can literally fly. Falls into every pit.
[4:22:30] <DrozZombie> looks like its almost time to come back to warframe huh?
[4:22:49] <%DappercatEsquire> woohoo wacky pizza director
[4:22:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait, can someone like, VERY Briefly summarize whats going ith Heart of Deimos.
[4:22:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> what is it, Infestation shit?
[4:23:04] <%toolofparanoia> I saw Cave Bleed
[4:23:09] <penitentpentwitch> @DrozZombie Not much progress story wise. But if you like the grind, there's more to grind for.
[4:23:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Lil Whimsicle in this joint
[4:23:15] <%BinaryFireball> said with such authority
[4:23:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> When does that forth faction of Orokin remnants coming.
[4:23:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Lil Wacky in this area
[4:23:31] <heartlesshealer> the Nail
[4:23:32] <LoneFonte> infestation shit, derelict rework and some more orokin lore
[4:23:36] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Baby worried about crossroads
[4:23:42] <heartlesshealer> good name for something punched into the Foundation
[4:23:45] <atravelbee> How is Elmo and Zangief getting along?
[4:23:48] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur The planet Deimos, run by the Entrati Orokin Family, is in trouble. Go help against infested.
[4:23:48] <LoneFonte> also, they a use to the infested room
[4:24:06] <%Laecerelius> Naaaaaaaiiiiiiil!!
[4:24:08] <LoneFonte> they gave an use to the infested room*
[4:24:11] <+aeronauticaljon> Overly ERECT
[4:24:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch i know that as an MMO nothing can change forever but people seem really blas√© about the Infestation
[4:24:21] <xanderfist> Zangief is such a cool doggo
[4:24:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch the Infestation seems like an existential threat everyone should be fighting
[4:25:09] <$drfaustisdead> God the writing in this game makes me so happy.
[4:25:11] <SirKeigan> Is this good?
[4:25:28] <$RealThiele> spiral energy
[4:25:37] <heartlesshealer> oh boy, a huge spider
[4:25:41] <%crimsonharvest> Listen we kidnapped those german scientists fair and square in operation paperclip no this isnt a joke
[4:25:41] <transporterthesequel> Zangief is a good boi until he is hungry. When that happens he turns into a BORK MONSTER.
[4:25:44] <%Deekman> isn't that what the board looks like?
[4:25:47] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur It's mostly scale, Infested can still be handled by conventional weapons. Sentients are BS without void powers, which very few people have.
[4:25:49] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> How strong do you guys think my PC should be to play this game? I don't want to play it if it looks terrible
[4:25:52] <+aeronauticaljon> Cthulhu?
[4:25:53] <heartlesshealer> !
[4:25:53] <%Deekman> you fought one WAY earlier
[4:25:58] <heartlesshealer> baby????
[4:26:08] <heartlesshealer> no baby
[4:26:14] <$RealThiele> its the black beast of arrrrrgh
[4:26:23] <%Savages4Blood> psaDogchamp
[4:26:34] <Pookiedaexzile> HE does not like the short man, only the strong woman
[4:26:35] <+soundcloud_raptor> move cam 4 babby!
[4:26:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> its almost been a year since i played. i stopped right at Kuva Liches and Railjack
[4:26:40] <heartlesshealer> baby probably tired and want mom comforts
[4:26:42] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur Also the Heart is important to the Tenno, so there's a personal stake for that angle
[4:26:45] <%Savages4Blood> not surprising. dogs are the best
[4:26:55] <%komradedog> I feel ya, pat.
[4:27:02] <%nimu290> baby picked favorite
[4:27:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let's place bets on how many times Pat has cried because of baby pup in the last 72 hours. I'm going to say 3.
[4:27:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch ooh does this mean another yin/yang choice?
[4:27:05] <%Movemeister> Little boy blue and the man in the moon
[4:27:15] <DrozZombie> <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[4:27:18] <heartlesshealer> dogs are so good. I cried the other day over thinking about dogs even though I'd already taken my brain meds
[4:27:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch i did those 100% jut making choices i thought were right and i still am perfectly balanced. i feel like i won
[4:27:24] <RogueMinja> Gun upgrade?
[4:27:38] <+aeronauticaljon> Oooooh
[4:27:40] <+Dragstruction> is it on steam yet?
[4:27:41] <%CalderGaming> gun ORIGIN
[4:27:43] <%Savages4Blood> @patstaresat has zangief shown any destructive tendencies yet? my pupper liked to chew walls until he was a year old
[4:27:47] <Pookiedaexzile> A big Black Phallus that comes in and wrecks your world, and rearranges shit
[4:27:52] <transporterthesequel> Oh snap
[4:27:57] <General_Terro> "Bring me my longsword hope"
[4:27:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we Talk Control
[4:28:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> OH have they added lore to Arbiters of HExis yet? they had NO LORE.
[4:28:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> So A. Northmoore discovered the gun and B. Northmoore was even more of a douchebag than we first assumed
[4:28:03] <+Dragstruction> i been wanting to play it but phuck EGS
[4:28:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> w know NOTHING about those guys
[4:28:15] <DianaTheAscian> building is evil shocker
[4:28:15] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[4:28:20] <tentoa1> What game is this thing?
[4:28:20] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur Nope. More important from a functional, rather than a spiritual point of view. The Heart makes void powers work, without it Tenno can't Warframe.
[4:28:21] <$RealThiele> it gives you the strength of 12 men
[4:28:26] <heartlesshealer> the nail is hurt
[4:28:28] <$floralkami> @pookiedaexzile Kreygasm but also WutFace
[4:28:35] <%Savages4Blood> anyone getting dead space vibes a little bit
[4:28:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch i thought kiddo gave u that
[4:28:48] <xanderfist> yea
[4:28:54] <heartlesshealer> self or weapon
[4:29:04] <%CalderGaming> OK PAT. THIS CHOICE DOESN'T MATTER. DON'T WORRY.
[4:29:06] <$RealThiele> keep your silver cord safe
[4:29:06] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Self
[4:29:09] <%Deekman> you get them both later
[4:29:10] <heartlesshealer> left for personal upgrade, right for weapon
[4:29:11] <Pookiedaexzile> @floralkami Lol
[4:29:12] <%crimsonharvest> self or weapon is what it said
[4:29:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CalderGaming Dude.
[4:29:21] <TheMorilo> Choose one
[4:29:22] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur Nope, they gave you access to the instinctual reach for it. The Heart literally pump void into the universe.
[4:29:26] <%toolofparanoia> Thanks Space Triangle of Directors
[4:29:27] <heartlesshealer> watch the yellow dudes do the thing
[4:29:28] <+Dragstruction> this looks like the shitty trapped in the anumus with 16 or whatever his name is
[4:29:31] <+G_Thunders> Don‚Äôt worry about the mind goblins, the choice is temporary
[4:29:36] <heartlesshealer> left probably gets you higher
[4:29:36] <%CalderGaming> delete that if you want
[4:29:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch lol so The Idea of Evil
[4:29:43] <heartlesshealer> but right makes combat easier maybe
[4:29:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch the thing Miura semi-retconned out of Berserk
[4:29:51] <dellis80> snazzy matrix jacket PogChamp
[4:30:03] <TheMorilo> look at this gun nut choosing the gun
[4:30:03] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur To a degree, Yes!
[4:30:03] <%maskofmichael> Wrong choice, you lose
[4:30:05] <%juxtest> Suck it rocks
[4:30:08] <heartlesshealer> oooh nice, barrier destruction <3
[4:30:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PatStaresAt Pat can you walk up to the walls and move the camera in the marble is really pretty
[4:30:16] <waltzqueen> weed whack
[4:30:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why are people in chat actively trying to deny us the glory of Pat's mind goblins?
[4:30:30] <penitentpentwitch> And pat chose the loot accessing power, nice!
[4:30:35] <%CalderGaming> because we get enough already
[4:30:40] <$floralkami> seems kinda lame compared to the create option
[4:30:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can never have enough goblins
[4:30:57] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[4:30:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> oooooh
[4:31:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> its like the marble you'd see in the lobby of a really, really fancy office building
[4:31:16] <%twoto858> McGuffins LUL
[4:31:21] <%Savages4Blood> this game is so cool
[4:31:27] <$floralkami> it's basically lamer force push
[4:31:28] <%toolofparanoia> McGuffins LUL
[4:31:38] <heartlesshealer> I love the way the Bureau talks
[4:31:41] <dellis80> Gobuwin Shlaya
[4:31:55] <%toolofparanoia> I like the Board already
[4:31:58] <%Savages4Blood> rip
[4:31:58] <Vohs_Bru> oh no its a gold T1000
[4:32:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @floralkami Force Push is cool! Force Choke is just force push, on someone's neck from every direction at once
[4:32:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> I always felt like the Board are what it'd be like to meet G-Man's employers.
[4:32:44] <Djinnazz> Same
[4:32:46] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> what time is gamescom?
[4:32:50] <$floralkami> @liquiddinosaur i'm talking about the force push to smash through damaged walls, one of the first powers in this game
[4:32:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> It happened an hour ago
[4:33:18] <%superc37> @ordinaryaverageguys like 2 hours ago dude.
[4:33:26] <Storm_Samurai> I always liked her voice acting and narration
[4:33:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @OrdinaryAverageGuys in negative 33 hours
[4:33:32] <penitentpentwitch> Good ole plot stating monologue
[4:33:32] <%Savages4Blood> why does the director do all the legwork lol
[4:33:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> I know some people get annoyed by it, but I really like Jesse's internal monologues. Also what would a Remedy game be without near constantly internal snarking?
[4:33:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> 3*
[4:33:35] <+Byronic_dreamer> Thats a big ish
[4:33:35] <iamdiosson> New hotline pat
[4:33:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> 3 hours
[4:33:37] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This game is great
[4:33:43] <%toolofparanoia> You didn't miss much though
[4:33:49] <$drfaustisdead> The Hiss might be some of my favorite conceptual alien antagonists in a minute.
[4:33:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @OrdinaryAverageGuys if its any consolation it was FUCKING NOTHING
[4:33:59] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> so no elden ring
[4:34:02] <Storm_Samurai> Howdy Polaris
[4:34:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Polaris is best girl/eldritch being
[4:34:10] <%toolofparanoia> What is the Boad?
[4:34:16] <%toolofparanoia> *board
[4:34:17] <$RealThiele> Elden ring confirmed for 2077
[4:34:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @toolofparanoia Your employers
[4:34:23] <%Savages4Blood> good lord my skill trees look nothing like that yet hahaha
[4:34:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @OrdinaryAverageGuys nnnoooope. they gave an award for Best PS4 game to Cyberpunk 2077
[4:34:44] <%superc37> @toolofparanoia i take it you werent around for pats playthrough of the game?
[4:34:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @OrdinaryAverageGuys its a new low. Awarding games that havent come out yet is nothing new but ITS NOT EVEN A PS4 GAME. IT'S A MULTIPLATFORM WITH PC FOCUS
[4:34:59] <EuropanLamprey> Elden Ring confirmed to release three days after Half Like 3
[4:34:59] <+Sleepy_Puma> control deez nuts
[4:35:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Sleepy_Puma yes honey
[4:35:23] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> wowzers
[4:35:28] <%toolofparanoia> @CommanderSqueaks Are the human or "other"? @superc37 Yeah not really all of it
[4:35:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @toolofparanoia Definitely 'other'
[4:35:44] <%Savages4Blood> @sleepy_puma oooohh no. you're not fooling me with that again
[4:35:46] <dellis80> @ordinaryaverageguys that's the most 2020 thing I've heard all day LUL
[4:35:57] <%superc37> @toolofparanoia they are the Board. thats all you need to know.
[4:36:11] <$RealThiele> why hire many 3d artist when few will do
[4:36:13] <%toolofparanoia> I'm down with that
[4:36:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @toolofparanoia They 'choose' the Director, they control or at least maintain the Oldest House (the original building Pat was in), and they hate the Hiss. That's about all we know so far.
[4:36:43] <%superc37> also it's probably a good idea to watch his lp of the main game for reasons that should be obvious
[4:36:49] <%crimsonharvest> is that what they're calling it now
[4:37:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> why do people need to use hydrofracking when this pistol exists
[4:37:17] <%Savages4Blood> dont says me creepy ghost lady
[4:37:19] <%Deekman> if it's the hotline who knows
[4:37:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> IS SHE?!
[4:37:20] <%Savages4Blood> sass
[4:37:21] <RogueMinja> Yes.
[4:37:25] <penitentpentwitch> The Hotline does have a track record of speaking to the dead
[4:37:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are these dead people even ghosts, are they even actually dead?
[4:37:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who the fuck knows.
[4:37:30] <SpaceGuntank> gotta love those physics
[4:37:31] <%superc37> @liquiddinosaur only the director can use the gun.
[4:37:40] <$RealThiele> Shes got ghosts in her blood, better do cocaine about it
[4:37:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> ah its magic gn?
[4:37:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LiquidDinosaur Anyone else who even tries to pick up the gun has a really bad day.
[4:37:57] <%Savages4Blood> @commandersqueaks they're all sitting around playing bingo in another room
[4:38:08] <$Dakuu75> what a money saver these "CS" are... just 5 minutes of dialogue with the same 3 sillouetts
[4:38:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LiquidDinosaur It may be Excalibur and/or Mjlonir, no really.
[4:38:20] <%Deekman> THE NAIL AND THE BOARD
[4:38:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> Ooooh that's cool
[4:38:31] <%toolofparanoia> @CommanderSqueaks good enough for me. Need to save the world/universe and the foundation, take orders from ominous voices
[4:38:33] <DianaTheAscian> are those live action?
[4:38:33] <%Savages4Blood> @deekman omg haha
[4:38:35] <Pookiedaexzile> "Ayo Imma look right right quick during my monologue hol up"
[4:38:36] <+Estuko> monkaS
[4:38:42] <penitentpentwitch> It changes to fit the owner
[4:38:46] <%superc37> @liquiddinosaur the answer is "hey maybe watch pats lp before watching the games dlc/sequel"
[4:38:49] <ape_hawk> NAAAAAAAAAAIIILLLL! Who's at the door?
[4:38:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @superc37 hey maybe i dont care
[4:39:02] <%CalderGaming> fortunately the astral spike (the angry blob) attacks everything
[4:39:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @toolofparanoia This game is also canonically in the same universe as Alan Wake (and I THINK Max Payne too?)
[4:39:11] <Djinnazz> @DianaTheAscian yup
[4:39:32] <Pookiedaexzile> What would your version of the Control Weapon be
[4:39:33] <ape_hawk> and quantum break
[4:39:38] <ape_hawk> ft. Iceman
[4:39:44] <%toolofparanoia> @superc37 going to. I've now been reminded of something i can watch while working from home cause work is slow af right now
[4:39:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Pookiedaexzile A gun is pretty good.
[4:39:50] <Djinnazz> not quantum Break
[4:39:53] <$Dakuu75> that rock is have a fucking epileptic seisure, bruh
[4:39:58] <LasagnaXaga> So, anyone can explain what have I missed? Just tunning in and know the base Control
[4:40:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> Probably a gun because if i can choose why not pick something that can kill from far away
[4:40:18] <Djinnazz> Sniped
[4:40:20] <$RealThiele> quantum break is too entangled with MSFT
[4:40:21] <%toolofparanoia> @CommanderSqueaks heard that yeah. Alan Wake is on my backlog to play
[4:40:22] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dang
[4:40:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are they swinging around construction equipment? Were these poor bastards just miners?
[4:40:26] <+Pyroclase> yeah so the difficulty in this DLC is real
[4:40:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get rekt
[4:40:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrong, The correct Answer is a anti tank rifle
[4:40:39] <TheMorilo> this game doesn't joke
[4:40:46] <%Savages4Blood> pat would you rather a dark souls 4 or bloodborne 2? personally, I want bloodborne.
[4:40:46] <Pookiedaexzile> but Katana would have sufficed
[4:40:48] <%CalderGaming> @LasagnaXaga the Board wants jesse to fix something in the foundation. there's a broken structure called the Nail that needs repairing in order to stop the astral plane from bleeding into reality
[4:40:58] <ape_hawk> get gud
[4:41:04] <LasagnaXaga> Gotcha, thank you!
[4:41:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Fleshlight would have got you an A for effort
[4:41:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CalderGaming Moooore so than it usually does anyway.
[4:41:12] <avidneptune> Fast travel back to the nail
[4:41:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> you know what this very slightly reminds me of
[4:41:23] <%tanarath> Bleeding into the Bureau, basically.
[4:41:43] <$RealThiele> this is truly the dark souls of scp games
[4:41:44] <$Dakuu75> Gun miner
[4:41:49] <%Savages4Blood> rekt
[4:41:58] <%Savages4Blood> it's SO satisfying lol
[4:41:59] <+p3rcey> this game looks like a game
[4:42:02] <%CalderGaming> @CommanderSqueaks to date it hasn't, really. every trip to the astral plane in vanilla control is mediated through an object of power
[4:42:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, I love how the Board knew that just placing a gun in an obsidian pedestal would tempt SOMEONE to try and pull it out.
[4:42:14] <Pookiedaexzile> 12 weeks old and already shitting on Pat, this dogs going places
[4:42:23] <%Savages4Blood> @p3rcey it reminds me of a game. weird isnt it
[4:42:24] <$Dakuu75> is there a grenade launcher mod?
[4:42:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> the SCP that's a laptop , but its analog, which means that there's a hatch in the bottom leading to an extradimensional space containing an unfathomably large and complex amount of machinary that all serve to make the laptop's operation possible, and sometimes it'll display a message saying like "please replace gear X in subsection Y and the foundation sends an expedition down inside the computer to fix it"
[4:42:41] <%CalderGaming> @Dakuu75 yes there is!
[4:43:11] <%CalderGaming> Astral Spike
[4:43:13] <$Dakuu75> <3
[4:43:18] <$drfaustisdead> I love when enemies fight each other.
[4:43:21] <%CalderGaming> oh thanks game
[4:43:22] <+CSNG> Is this game worth getting?
[4:43:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Astral Spike
[4:43:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do you really want an answer?
[4:43:40] <+Estuko> @CSNG Steam Ultimate edition is 32$
[4:43:41] <rbakervv> becuase the game hates you
[4:43:46] <$RealThiele> id say wait for a sale
[4:43:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> Man i wish i had the power to be immune to fall damage wouldnt that rule?
[4:43:55] <Pookiedaexzile> @LiquidDinosaur Does it run Crysis at Max?
[4:44:30] <silentblast93> where is zangefe
[4:44:35] <%CalderGaming> lol F
[4:45:07] <+CSNG> @Estuko @RealThiele thanks, I'll probably check it out when it goes on sale
[4:45:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ooo, I like that line.
[4:45:11] <+ALazo> I like that line
[4:45:13] <$Dakuu75> @LiquidDinosaur would you still leave a crater if you jumped out a building?
[4:45:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Morale is long dead and its corpse is starting to smell" is a good line
[4:45:20] <%tinyswampthing> my bulldog snores like my grandma
[4:45:33] <%tinyswampthing> like almost exactly the same
[4:45:39] <%Capta1n_H3nry> SOFTWARE?!
[4:45:44] <%Deekman> this is the worst part of the dlc
[4:45:45] <DianaTheAscian> software?
[4:45:52] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is that Penguin?
[4:45:53] <$RealThiele> it wasnt cancer that killed lovecraft, they sent him down here to record messages
[4:45:57] <silentblast93> so are is like weaping angels?
[4:45:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Fall damage is just all force damage if you think about it
[4:46:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dakuu75 lets say its like Shadow of Mordor where you become a ghost at the end
[4:46:13] <RogueMinja> I'm assuming bad news.
[4:46:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> No don't name them.
[4:46:27] <$Dakuu75> @LiquidDinosaur lol
[4:46:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Concern
[4:46:38] <%Deekman> meh forget that recording exists
[4:46:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ash you're doing me a big concern
[4:46:41] <ape_hawk> dont bond with eldritch horrors, kids
[4:46:44] <DianaTheAscian> he's compromised
[4:46:45] <waltzqueen> NEVER name something in the SCP foundation, that's how you die
[4:46:45] <Vyskus> hi
[4:46:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Residents? Prisoners? Nah Bruh Enemy Types
[4:46:51] <$RealThiele> but what if we let the monsters into our head
[4:47:03] <%toolofparanoia> yeah he shouldn'yt have done that
[4:47:07] <$Dakuu75> don't stick your dick in eldritch horrors
[4:47:11] <silentblast93> so is she the director now?
[4:47:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dakuu75 i cant seem to find the article but IIRC the point is it was functionally just a completely mundane Dell laptop
[4:47:18] <%Capta1n_H3nry> I mean...
[4:47:21] <Vyskus> you can't stop me dakuu
[4:47:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> so no
[4:47:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> it might run Crisis badly
[4:47:28] <%Movemeister> bring the walls down!
[4:47:29] <iamdiosson> Wow pat it took me forever to find that and you did in a second
[4:47:30] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> no mass effect :(
[4:47:32] <waltzqueen> @Dakuu75 but....but
[4:47:44] <%CalderGaming> @silentblast93 yes, she has been the director since she picked up the gun at the beginning of the base game
[4:47:47] <@SoFarFetched> Pat looks like he could use a nap
[4:47:49] <$crusader_raul> Rituals now?!? Oh boy
[4:47:58] <%toolofparanoia> the effects in this game are great
[4:47:59] <%CalderGaming> ...and didn't die
[4:48:06] <ape_hawk> you look like too much of a coward, pat
[4:48:08] <$RealThiele> baby snores is releasing sleep energy
[4:48:09] <Pookiedaexzile> I love how I said that Crisis thing and just revealed that chat would let a eldtrich horror in for a gaming pc
[4:48:27] <+SlashHabit> this game is basically everything I believe in
[4:48:36] <ape_hawk> THE ORB!
[4:48:43] <%toolofparanoia> worked for Civvie11
[4:48:50] <+ianabstract> OOORB
[4:48:51] <Djinnazz> THE ORB
[4:48:54] <%Movemeister> orbed, as all things should be
[4:48:57] <$joylent_blue> you always were the sphere pat
[4:49:07] <%Laecerelius> Pat is only orb!
[4:49:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile I'd need a jetpack at least to let in an eldritch horror
[4:49:13] <$RealThiele> now ride Ozma
[4:49:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile oh also the jetpack has to not set my ass on fire
[4:49:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile actually fuck it i need to be able to fly, or at least airdash like Jesse here
[4:49:37] <+G_Thunders> The Id are fighting the Hiss
[4:49:42] <+Estuko> @LiquidDinosaur smart
[4:50:06] <%toolofparanoia> Behold the awesome power of the OOOOOORRRRRB
[4:50:40] <Pookiedaexzile> This dude talking bout flying, I aint doing so much as summoning a minor demon for less than selective immortality and health
[4:50:43] <$joylent_blue> love her coat tail physics
[4:50:57] <iamdiosson> Thou hath nail‚Äôd it.
[4:51:01] <Djinnazz> lol
[4:51:02] <$RealThiele> love games that allow me to KRONCH useless mods
[4:51:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Gimme the time I'll figure out the flying and telekensis
[4:51:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RealThiele do you play Warframe?
[4:51:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RealThiele if not do i got a game for you
[4:51:42] <$RealThiele> i tried but the FoV kicks in my motion sickness bad
[4:52:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> i get motion sick playing Doom or other fake-3D early FPS
[4:52:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can't you disable that?
[4:52:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> its the way you're just sliding around the world
[4:52:30] <Djinnazz> oh fuck it's you
[4:52:32] <penitentpentwitch> Hi Former
[4:52:36] <%toolofparanoia> i'm very sorry for anyone that experience motion sickness in video games :(
[4:52:41] <%blaccbird914> DAFUQ WAS THAT

[4:52:50] <%twoto858> It's Former!
[4:52:57] <%juxtest> Save the Orb
[4:53:05] <%Laecerelius> Was that the fridge boss fight monster?
[4:53:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> He was a board member that was 'kicked out', that's all we know.
[4:53:21] <%CalderGaming> @Laecerelius sure was
[4:53:22] <SpaceGuntank> oorrrrb!
[4:53:25] <cipher758> grab the ball pat
[4:53:25] <penitentpentwitch> @Laecerelius Correct
[4:53:27] <transporterthesequel> Wait...wait, does she SEE the board say Lock/Key?
[4:53:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> hey so, i know the answer is at least "probably" but in the latest Doom is it 100% solid CONFIRMED that the Doom comic is canon and you are that particular Doom Guy?
[4:53:37] <$joylent_blue> he's pat
[4:53:37] <Vohs_Bru> Patricia
[4:53:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jesse's self confidence is very nice, you go get 'em girl.
[4:53:43] <%toolofparanoia> only time ive feel sick in a moving vehicle is when im reading like a book
[4:53:44] <%Ipsenscastle> wait, YOU'RE Pat?!
[4:53:48] <$RealThiele> mostly yes on doomguy
[4:53:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> like is it merely HEAVILY IMPLIED or is it CONFIRMED
[4:53:53] <%RyTYoung> So...how we all enjoying the Foundations of the Bureau?
[4:53:56] <$floralkami> @transporterthesequel they speak directly in her mind
[4:53:58] <+Skaphel> Excellent work me/pat/player
[4:54:01] <Pookiedaexzile> "I'm Cocky despite being surrounded by mind exploding impossiblities haha"
[4:54:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CommanderSqueaks i mean, if you could fly and had a magic gun you'd be confident too
[4:54:18] <%CalderGaming> yeah the new multithrow costs 8
[4:54:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile mind exploding possibilities are less scary when you're also magic
[4:54:25] <+Estuko> LUL almost put a bullet in some dude
[4:54:31] <Pookiedaexzile> "I'm just being Quirky in the face of crippling terror creature"
