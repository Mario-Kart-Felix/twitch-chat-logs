[0:10:32] <+TunakIn> TIME MAGE
[0:10:34] <+emperri> geomancer was fine in XI
[0:10:34] <rReizs> ARITHETICIAN
[0:10:36] <%hoodedlefty> We’re totally going to Garlamold right
[0:10:37] <%alcors_wisdom> ever thought about checking out "escape from tarkov" pat it seems like its the type of game that would be the bane of your goblins but it has leon-esque inventory management
[0:10:37] <+griffball13> BLUE MAGE 2 LETS GO
[0:10:38] <$Futurecity10> calling it 100% its geomancer

[0:10:38] <%Kiiper> geomancer is great no u
[0:10:38] <%TenderBabyBacon> New healer called chef and you do cooking minigames to heal party
[0:10:40] <%HarveyBirbman> how long until it actually starts again
[0:10:40] <penitentpendant> It's already part of AST questline
[0:10:40] <Rein_Paladin> Gunbreaker 2
[0:10:40] <%cowardman93> I bought 14 back when Heavensward came out and only began last year and got to Shadowbringers last week so I am super ready for this event
[0:10:40] <%Sausious> I expect Chemist, Time Mage/Green Mage, and maaaaaaybe Spell Fecner/Mystic Knight?
[0:10:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Geomancer is just a dps white mage
[0:10:42] <%BigCoffee> Ur Lame
[0:10:42] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man, what if Time Mage?
[0:10:43] <ramblingdove> Hard hard agree
[0:10:43] <%Grey_prince> Grey_prince subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I'm so hoping we get chemist also woo x amount of months

[0:10:47] <scrumbotime> Songstress
[0:10:47] <Edajos> but bells tho
[0:10:47] <%JoshManVGH> How even?
[0:10:48] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Confirm all predictions real fast
[0:10:48] <roguemephilesclone> Black Mage is kind of already Geomancer. I don't know what they do.
[0:10:48] <dinnydanny777> Isn't Aerith supposed to be a geomancer
[0:10:49] <%NopeBadguy> GIVE ME PHYS RANGED GAMBLER
[0:10:50] <Owkono> Chemist will have a syringe for a weapon
[0:10:51] <%Mendin> I unironically want Geomancer
[0:10:51] <syanplague> Geomance is almost a half white mage
[0:10:51] <%the22cstomp> astro was time mage
[0:10:52] <%BluBarracuda> beastmasterrrrrr
[0:10:53] <+The__Strongest> gambler would be so toxic
[0:10:54] <Kain5707> will Yoshi P be wearing a M.A.S.H shirt? @PatStaresAt
[0:10:55] <+ApocalypticExpress> What about Necromancer?
[0:10:56] <+emperri> time mage can't work in a MMO
[0:10:57] <%SomeSageAdvice> Geomancer i am scared of it being the class since AST quests is acting like its going to happen
[0:10:58] <%Frost_Quill> Exarch was a time mage.
[0:10:58] <SaphronBlackbourne> So like, as someone pretty new to the game (Shadowbringers is my first expac) was Stormblood really that bad as people say it is? It felt okay playing through the story but I did find Lyse and the Ala Mhigo parts way less cool than the Doma parts.
[0:10:58] <%super_ej8> Here comes Crazy Talk LUL
[0:10:59] <%AllenDeadman> I will sleep if I see oracle
[0:11:01] <Cactuskris> fracture is an ok game#
[0:11:02] <$maverickleeback> Beast Master?
[0:11:04] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Astro is literally a time mage but they removed the skills
[0:11:04] <+TunakIn> Time mages are bullshitt
[0:11:06] <vVAstrAVv> i want green mage tank
[0:11:07] <%HiroTSK5> Haste would btreak everything
[0:11:09] <2DSuperiority> any buffs that are not damage based LUL
[0:11:09] <%FabledGuy> Mystic Knight would be cool
[0:11:11] <%Garthunox> Stopza
[0:11:13] <%MaddyCaddy> Haste would completely ruin the balance
[0:11:14] <greatgetter> As a Limited Job?
[0:11:14] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Haste/Stop would be meta af
[0:11:14] <%PanicSwytch> I want crazy talk to activate so bad
[0:11:14] <%WhereIsWill> thatd be busted af
[0:11:15] <%BluBarracuda> but there's a geomancer in game
[0:11:15] <penitentpendant> Imagine a Healer with a Invuln External
[0:11:16] <+genowyn> No haste please my cds will drift
[0:11:16] <%JoshManVGH> Wouldn't it fuck up rotations too?
[0:11:20] <%cowardman93> can chemist be super tired and done with people's shit instead of typical healer
[0:11:20] <%Sausious> Haste would be AWFUL it would be a clipping NIGHTMARE
[0:11:21] <NocturneNovember> MOON GANG
[0:11:21] <%RNGbob> RNGbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Gene Park was cool, but when are you hack frauds going to get a real big name guest like Rich Evans?

[0:11:23] <giantpandas1> when they going to add the pat champion
[0:11:24] <%Alazull> Yeah haste outside of a really short time window with a long cooldown would be fucked
[0:11:27] <%psydaku> SPELL BLADE WHEN
[0:11:27] <+TheBitingIrish> THE DRIFT! doodTerror
[0:11:27] <+projectmanatees> Plus Astro has some time mage spells
[0:11:27] <+emperri> FF14 doesn't have real buffer classes anymore
[0:11:29] <+eanscrale> Everyone do your rotations 10X FASTER
[0:11:31] <Enemy_In_Disguise> watch them add beastmaster or some shit
[0:11:31] <%Monkeyweed21> real ass haste and slow would be borked
[0:11:31] <%republicofu> that would make time mage REQUIRED for everything
[0:11:32] <%AllenDeadman> time mage is dead
[0:11:32] <%Garthunox> Alexander is busted in 14 for a reason!
[0:11:33] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Haste would make classes unplayable LUL
[0:11:34] <AoiRob> freelancer hype
[0:11:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Heck, Stop and Slow couldn't even be used in actual content
[0:11:35] <dinnydanny777> They can still go through all the FFXIII roles I guess
[0:11:35] <rReizs> spear already fucked up some peoples rotation in HW
[0:11:35] <%HiroTSK5> Give me more Stopza tho
[0:11:36] <Laecerelius> Aren't the Demis also part of Time Magic?
[0:11:37] <jillpilled> Haste would ruin this game forever LUL
[0:11:37] <%AzureGale> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[0:11:38] <penitentpendant> Pat ASCENDS
[0:11:38] <+Kindan55> no paige?
[0:11:39] <+dudermcbrohan> stormblood was fine when a villain wasn't on screen
[0:11:40] <%MrP33Ps> monks with haste lol
[0:11:41] <Goobbue> Haste but only for yourself as a DPS would be nice
[0:11:42] <GrandMazterNelson> im blind
[0:11:42] <%AllenDeadman> it'd be a joke class like blue mage
[0:11:42] <gachabasta> but that's exactly why I want Time Mage babeyyyyy

[0:13:12] <%Aeoneth> Your spoilers can't affect me, I have no context for anything
[0:13:13] <%AllenDeadman> fuck it
[0:13:13] <dinnydanny777> Square Enix has not made a trailer in the past 5 years that did not have massive spoilers LUL
[0:13:14] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> There WILL almost certainly be ShB spoilers and you DO NOT want that shit spoiled
[0:13:14] <%AncelDeLambert> that's fine, I was only interested in the crafting, and the inventory system fucks that
[0:13:14] <%SomeSageAdvice> wow 1,200 viewers in here for the showcase psaDogchamp

[0:13:45] <+Raiden_Breaker> Promo art will spoil you
[0:13:46] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Remember when the E3 trailer just straight up gave the biggest spoiler
[0:13:47] <%Dwarven_Gaming> you mean heavensward?
[0:13:47] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Male Viera, Female Hroth, let's fucking go

[0:13:56] <%caramelatte1> They did BUT THEY SWAPPED THE CHARACTERS THAT SAID THE SPOILER
[0:13:56] <dinnydanny777> They did in the FF7R and KH3 trailers too LUL
[0:13:56] <+Kindan55> oh yeah.

[0:14:15] <gachabasta> didnt they died though? except...no
[0:14:16] <$Auctorian> Cheer500 ngl would love to see chemist and finally have a use for all those blasted potions and junk that get set aside as pointless rn
[0:14:17] <+Darkhawkin> No one is truely dead in final fantasy
[0:14:17] <rReizs> OH GOD IS Y'SHTOLA ALIVE
[0:14:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt They keep calling it the final fantasy but there are more games all the time. What gives?
[0:14:17] <syanplague> i can see that
[0:14:18] <+TheotherKristian> Aerith, what are you doing in FF14?!?
[0:14:20] <StarMechV> I emant mroe The entirety of the Ammurot city tour was not in any trailers of Shadowbringers...was it?
[0:14:21] <Scrumdreew> I mean your right
[0:14:22] <%Frost_Quill> Who the fuck knows who that character is, but also doesn't know they join the crew???
[0:14:22] <+emperri> @T_Sasquatch yes that was literally in a trailer released weeks before that patch
[0:14:25] <TheHastySlowpoke> They should add Tidus to every final fantasy game, just cause
[0:14:26] <+Darkhawkin> just like the yukuzies
[0:14:27] <%cowardman93> I remember seeing the HW trailer as the title for the game for a while and fuck it was big spoilz
[0:14:28] <%hoodedlefty> hoodedlefty subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! like we're totally taking the fight to the empire right? Like that final zone HASTE to be the capital.
[0:14:30] <%Sausious> ps4 dead
[0:14:30] <+Kango234> That's a shame, but it makes total sense so I'll just leave now.
[0:14:30] <%PanicSwytch> Bread
[0:14:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wait, didn't the small one die twice?
[0:14:31] <+zalonar> oh boy that's like a year's worth of spoilers in one character
[0:14:32] <%Garthunox> I love Oranger
[0:14:33] <+lunar_decay> god please
[0:14:33] <+Kindan55> will probably be next expansion.
[0:14:34] <+AlphaRayAllen> Beep boop
[0:14:35] <CappuccinoGuil> what's happening?
[0:14:40] <jillpilled> If they cut off PS4 support that would do it after a point
[0:14:42] <%Puhff> RIP smooth rock :(
[0:14:43] <penitentpendant> Come on! Newest Scion in trailer for maximum fan pandering, LESSA GO
[0:14:44] <Sol_Install> yea
[0:14:45] <%HiroTSK5> Didn't the stinger of the Heavensward trailer spoil the stinger of the expansion?
[0:14:45] <%MrP33Ps> Better shaders please
[0:14:48] <%Mendin> I saw the shadowbringers trailer while still in ARR and it inherently spoiled a lot of shit for me lmao
[0:14:49] <Skelegon> Let's go Time Mage
[0:14:49] <emoonimoo> Can it still be a spoiler if you have no idea what's going on?
[0:14:50] <%MrP33Ps> that's all I really need
[0:14:52] <+lunar_decay> #deathtopixelgrass
[0:14:52] <BlkFlameKami> has square ever done that, used ai upscaling?
[0:14:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Has it begun yet?
[0:14:54] <TioXyco> but ps4 limitations *the new meme*
[0:14:55] <%great_tj> NEW EXPANSION
[0:14:55] <%Frost_Quill> PS5 and high-end PCs only from now on, everyone else gets fucked.
[0:14:56] <Sol_Install> I would do the second option pretty
[0:14:56] <Dante_Namikaze1> Or delete the PS4 users
[0:14:57] <%great_tj> IAM SO HYPE
[0:15:02] <RamenRiderZ> PS4 limitations Kappa
[0:15:03] <+emperri> the big bad of the next expansion is Papalymo Requiem
[0:15:03] <Scoobles64> Final Fantasy 14: Skateboarding
[0:15:03] <%alcors_wisdom> every update they'll uprez a few texture packs
[0:15:07] <ShepardUA> better FXAA ffs NotLikeThis
[0:15:08] <$Pompadourius> I WANNA SEE THE MONK REWORK LET'S GOOOO
[0:15:10] <%SirFancySwank> I beat shadowbringers and know nothing of the existing of story cause my friend wanted me to rush through
[0:15:12] <+TheBitingIrish> ARR is built on a mountain of spaghetti code
[0:15:14] <%Alazull> My guess will be that we won't see a major update to it until 7.x
[0:15:15] <rReizs> mutha fackin papalymo back from the lifestream kicking ass and taking names
[0:15:17] <T_Sasquatch> @jillpilled they wouldn't DARE until like 5 years from now
[0:15:19] <KahnWick> Do you see the Xbox version being announced today?
[0:15:19] <Cactuskris> yeah they can look at Wow
[0:15:21] <%crazyspartan214> FF14 steam is up!!!!
[0:15:24] <+Kindan55> please god fix the AA
[0:15:25] <%Dwarven_Gaming> they need to RIP OUT of that spagetti code
[0:15:26] <FuzzyyBones> Pat, what did you have for breakfast today?
[0:15:28] <%Sausious> I miss the Textureless Rock in South Shroud
[0:15:30] <%MrP33Ps> That's so crazy to me
[0:15:32] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Pat where do you want the new raid series to be set, assuming the expansion takes place in Garlemald?
[0:15:32] <TioXyco> @Pompadourius but monk was already reworked
[0:15:36] <stevenellis386> did I miss the presentation already?
[0:15:37] <Iwashi94> Those Crystal Exarch Textures LUL
[0:15:40] <Kain5707> they can still upscale the textures
[0:15:41] <+Doorjamb13> I'm fine with the AI uprising if it means I get shinny 4k textures
[0:15:42] <+Raiden_Breaker> ms store version as well
[0:15:44] <Kain5707> look at FF9
[0:15:44] <%Hobojo153> Didn't they said Xbox was gonna be with the DX12 update
[0:15:46] <Goobbue> Since FFXVI seems to be running on a massively upgraded version of the XIV engine, maybe they'll backport some of the new tech they've done for that
[0:15:48] <%ssjklyco> Japan either gives 0 shits about spoilers ( see lord of the rings trailer for japan) or all the shits ( See any Old Atlus game stream)
[0:15:48] <%fishmonger555> Do you think Pat will be announced as a handsome boy? OH WAIT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
[0:15:50] <%MrP33Ps> Up their player base
[0:15:51] <%caramelatte1> What if for switch though? lol
[0:15:51] <%hoodedlefty> spagett code must be defeated
[0:15:52] <%Frost_Quill> @Alazull ARE we getting a 7.0 even??? I thought they said this was the last one?
[0:15:53] <convo445> didn't they also talk about a switch port at some point?
[0:15:53] <%cowardman93> you can see in shadowbringers that they're stretching the engine to its limit
[0:15:53] <secret_npc> Pat do you think they'll announce XIV-2
[0:15:53] <viviknight> how are the babies?
[0:15:53] <%CokeMilkRequiem> FF14-2?
[0:15:54] <pk_piss> LETS GO RUNEFENCER
[0:15:55] <%BluBarracuda> PIXEL TEXTURE
[0:15:55] <%HiroTSK5> FFXVI looks like it'll use uprezed FFxiv assets based on that only trailer
[0:15:59] <%JoshManVGH> What about further Monk Reworks?
[0:15:59] <+lunar_decay> TooTheMoon!
[0:15:59] <%great_tj> @PatStaresAt Is it confirmed that Natsuko Ishikawa will still be the writer?
[0:15:59] <+emperri> boy if they could redo the engine to the point where ping was not a debuff that'd be swell
[0:16:02] <%cowardman93> fuck no is it
[0:16:02] <$Pompadourius> @Pompadourius Yeah, but the rework they made is one that they admitted isn't enough, they wanna rework it again for 6.0
[0:16:03] <jillpilled> @t_sasquatch Yeah they sat on the PS3 for some time, think they'd give a good bit of forewarning to peeps :b
[0:16:04] <%papertoonz1414> no
[0:16:04] <AoiRob> the hair textures dear lord plz

[0:16:05] <rReizs> monk will be reworked more in 6.0, this is just a stopgap improvement
[0:16:06] <TheAntitype> I laugh every time I see the Crystal Exarch close up lmao
[0:16:06] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I don't believe that
[0:16:06] <+lunar_decay> bs
[0:16:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt which dps type do u think they're gonna add?

[0:16:16] <+Rekinsinn> OneGuy
[0:16:16] <+NeonLight> I mean, its not nearly as CPU intensive as XIV
[0:16:17] <convo445> is 14 based on those crystal tools?
[0:16:17] <+zalonar> shut up no it's not
[0:16:17] <+Raiden_Breaker> thought it was unreal
[0:16:18] <+emperri> there is no way

[0:16:18] <%Alazull> @Frost_Quill I have never seen that confirmed

[0:16:20] <Midnight188> green mage limited job or bust

[0:16:25] <dinnydanny777> I've seen people say they don't like FFXVI already but I think it looks sick
[0:16:25] <DianaTheAscian> no way it is
[0:16:27] <%maybefalco> theres zero chance it is
[0:16:28] <+lunar_decay> that's definitely a lie

[0:16:32] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Theres no way, the XIV engine is old as shit
[0:16:33] <%AllenDeadman> no way in hell

[0:17:00] <%HiroTSK5> FFXVI uses the same animations on facials animations, at least in that trailer.
[0:17:00] <+TheBitingIrish> @Frost_Quill I would assume they would at least let us reach lv100, so that means 2 more expacs

[0:21:45] <+TheBitingIrish> @Mega_Driver That's why Arcanist is the only split upgrade
[0:21:46] <%ThirdWelles> ThirdWelles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Oh shit! Subiversary on announcement day! I'm super excited for the news! If this turns out to be a wet fart where we don't get anything good, I'll die.
[0:21:47] <Mega_Driver> @TheBitingIrish Oh really? Thats interesting
[0:21:47] <Iwashi94> LUL
[0:21:47] <%patriotrenegade> Beards dont exist in Japan
[0:21:47] <%Jay_Squirrel> even in real life
[0:21:48] <Zeif00> The lack of facial options overall is unbelievable in a game this old
[0:21:50] <%maybefalco> LUL
[0:21:50] <rReizs> tall buns would be big but short buns would EXPLODE
[0:21:50] <+griffball13> GOT EM
[0:21:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Japan has no beards, apparently
[0:21:51] <$Pompadourius> BISHI BOYS IN JAPAN
[0:21:51] <%Sargonyx> But then how would he look like a bishi animu boy?
[0:21:52] <$Afterman_> male viera look like pats
[0:21:53] <%AzureGale> gdi
[0:21:55] <%TEANTACLES> REAL BUTT SLIDERS WHEN

[0:21:58] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat You do realize that new class is a DPS right?
[0:21:59] <AGood_Noodle> Beard don't exist in Japan
[0:22:01] <CappuccinoGuil> if you go to Japan, you are legally obligated to shave
[0:22:05] <+emperri> ff14's reason for not adding male viera makes enough sense. it's not their original race and they don't want to canonize some shit they made up for something they borrowed
[0:22:06] <%Birdigalore> Damn Japan and their baby smooth faces!
[0:22:06] <%abakkus> remap male au ra shading planes bc that shit looks jank as fuck

[0:22:12] <Midnight188> Sephiroth shows up and becomes the REAL final boss
[0:22:13] <+luftraumm1> beards aren't as popular in jp
[0:22:13] <SaphronBlackbourne> If I feel like switching it up for a bit I have CMTool
[0:22:14] <RamenRiderZ> Male Viera = Guido the bunny from Grandia
[0:22:14] <dredgyboi> Ill never forgive the japanese
[0:22:14] <Edajos> real butts dont exist in JP either
[0:22:16] <+mauricefaurron> Japenese people still have to shave tho right ?
[0:22:17] <TheMadBadger> It'd be DPS and Healer

[0:22:51] <$Zalthia> bork
[0:22:51] <%AllenDeadman> Japan wouldn't know how to make a good beard... they can't even grow them for the most part
[0:22:51] <SmolBluGhost> would tank and healer be a suprise
[0:22:52] <+Zandar12> no healers in like 6 years
[0:22:53] <%Jungos60> Here's hoping for Chemist and/or Necromancer Job announcement
[0:22:54] <powerprotoman> we could use a new magical dps to go with the melee dps

[0:23:46] <+trizetacannon44> You don't think they will do a ranged magic dps, that will be Alphinaud's new class. It seems like they set it up at the end of 5.3.

[0:24:59] <TerryTheTurret> @areyousquiddinme Why?
[0:25:00] <Zeif00> mnk is kinda half baked atm
[0:25:00] <%lucky_icarus> Really? I thought PLD and GBN were.
[0:25:00] <+Schrodingers_Box> Geomancer with Big Ass Hammer!
[0:25:01] <BigNerdSam> Gunbreaker needs more FF8 references
[0:25:02] <pilllowofbees> Time for bluemage buffs Kappa
[0:25:02] <Midnight188> not DRK?!?!?!
[0:25:02] <gachabasta> WAR can solo damn near anything WAR is too good
[0:25:03] <%MegboyManuel> IT IS
[0:25:03] <%Zabrewulf_X> Zabrewulf_X subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Thanks for always being a great source of entertainment. I need to keep up with the podcasts though.
[0:25:05] <%caramelatte1> Sch latest spells are unused, they need changes
[0:25:06] <+Rotanimood> I just want a class that uses a big great hammer
[0:25:06] <%Psych_man13_13> Just toss kingdom hearts into this
[0:25:07] <%JoshManVGH> Gunbreaker IS fun though
[0:25:08] <%NopeBadguy> AS A WAR, ITS GNB
[0:25:11] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> MAKE SCH GOOD AGAIN
[0:25:14] <%GalacticaPhanto> @zalthia it's mentioning the new expansion. of course it will
[0:25:15] <AltunRes> they need to be able to cast another 8 fell cleaves
[0:25:18] <%Alazull> FUCK YEAH
[0:25:18] <%chiluzza> i love having a bunga warrior to heal makes everything good
[0:25:20] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat What can i do to stop from every single electronic in my house from constantly zapping me on touch?
[0:25:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't know what lustrate is
[0:25:20] <+Raiden_Breaker> I heard the mana on that class is bad
[0:25:21] <%miguelrod777> would work
[0:25:22] <%ClericOfSparda> That would be dope
[0:25:23] <nmaten> thatd be dope
[0:25:23] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> You mean Adlo?
[0:25:23] <zecht89> WAR was better than it is now though
[0:25:24] <%VioletHeart> That'd be a great SCH bonus.
[0:25:25] <Scoobles64> mnk could use a new meter now
[0:25:25] <%Alazull> Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[0:25:26] <$Pompadourius> That'd be sick
[0:25:26] <%great_tj> Sick
[0:25:27] <%cowardman93> Gunbreaker is fun
[0:25:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Is Ssaryn a binch?
[0:25:29] <%MaddyCaddy> GNB is pretty good in Savage, that's all I'm saying
[0:25:30] <+ShutUpAceyP> i just want sch to feel fun
[0:25:30] <+seathts> War is probably the worst rn
[0:25:31] <+luftraumm1> more fell cleaves tho
[0:25:31] <Vesumon> It'd be cool if they redid Living Dead for DRK too lol
[0:25:31] <Forester_Skippy> thats actually a good idea
[0:25:33] <rReizs> GNB is good until you need to move the boss while in a gnashing combo
[0:25:33] <+desfore> Ultra Adlo
[0:25:34] <%AncelDeLambert> is this a binch opinion?
[0:25:35] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt You think we'll ever get a Chrono Trigger themed raid?
[0:25:36] <%Mr_Bop> I know nothing about what the game needs because I'm still in HW. I want more cute girls though
[0:25:36] <$Zalthia> man i wanted to join the hype train :(
[0:25:38] <+MightyPolo> @PatStaresAt We WANT shields to be shown on the main healthbar and not the party list.
[0:25:38] <%JoshManVGH> So "The Brightest Day"‽
[0:25:39] <+zalonar> absolutely
[0:25:40] <$Afterman_> gunbreaker is the most fun ive EVER had as a tank
[0:25:40] <TioXyco> GNB has good damage, WAR has great party mitigations
[0:25:41] <%ThirdWelles> As someone who started on WAR after shadowbringers started, that class is completely fine
[0:25:41] <%Freddy253> new machinist button
[0:25:43] <Midnight188> let AST crap out cards even faster to Divination forever
[0:25:47] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Would also be great for mitigating raid wide damage
[0:25:47] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I just Started the Sorrow of Werlyt mission i like the dialogue choices of 'mecha anime' in the second mission Cheer500
[0:25:47] <%Dakuu75> Everyone here playing 14 and I just got done binging 11 today, lol
[0:25:47] <Owkono> double fairy overdrive
[0:25:48] <lelouchrequiem> voice crack
[0:25:48] <$Pompadourius> How do you think Chemist would work, Pat? Non-casting healer?
[0:25:49] <2DSuperiority> remove Cure 1
[0:25:50] <@StridentSong> Adlo is a heal with a shield. I'm talking about just raw, big shield with no heal
[0:25:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Monk needs to turn the fist stances into something like Bard songs
[0:25:52] <%cowardman93> I want bigger and cooler gunblades for Gunbreaker
[0:25:53] <%hoodedlefty> YES bigger shield plz
[0:25:54] <zarkazeon> I think tanks over all could use a bump like move tomahawk to a later lvl and increase the range of overpower
[0:25:55] <ShepardUA> nerds Kappa
[0:25:55] <last_sentra> Give WHM more shields
[0:25:58] <+luftraumm1> shields are super cool
[0:25:59] <sjcodan> GNB is pretty solid
[0:25:59] <+cvsz555> WAR is kinda boring to dps on tho
[0:25:59] <Midnight188> lower the cd on Div to like 30 seconds
[0:25:59] <$Futurecity10> give bard res back motherfuckers
[0:26:05] <Hydrapissed> cya BARD
[0:26:05] <%snugglepuggs> and DELETE IT

[0:26:18] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> TURN IT INTO RANGER AND MAKE BARD A LIMITED
[0:26:19] <%CrownlessKitty> CrownlessKitty subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! pat you are partially responsible for getting me to play FF14, and i met some cool people through the game, thanks man
[0:26:19] <%JoshManVGH> Moar status effects
[0:26:19] <+genowyn> Bard and monk need total overhaul
[0:26:19] <%ShudMirelurk> atpRtsd
[0:26:19] <%krispen_wa> remove the pet system from SMN and just turn it into 5 different trances
[0:26:19] <Basch71> it truuuuue
[0:26:20] <+NeonLight> rework Bard into a full caster
[0:26:20] <%alcors_wisdom> fuck it just a make a new class right
[0:26:21] <Forester_Skippy> and then you roll dancer
[0:26:21] <$apolitenoob> Wait, ALL of bard?? I think it's fun though, the proc stuff is neat
[0:26:21] <rReizs> give me ranger and give me gigantic bows
[0:26:22] <+Kyma1020> More shields on top of BLN? That’s alotta shields
[0:26:23] <+TheBitingIrish> Listen to all these WAR mains begging to be buffed even further beyond
[0:26:23] <NagiHayatori> D:
[0:26:23] <%snugglepuggs> DELETE Bard.EXE
[0:26:24] <+SirSleepy> they should add a hunger meter and if you dont eat at least once every time you log in your character dies and gets deleted
[0:26:30] <%fishmonger555> LFG Castrum need clear...
[0:26:31] <Hydrapissed> GIVE IT the hunting horn treatment
[0:26:31] <+4thmusketeer> is monk still bad?
[0:26:31] <Nupinoop296> Bard is fine
[0:26:34] <onetrueking27> bard needs to not be on an 80s rotation
[0:26:34] <+OldManJEWc> Switch out bard for MHRise hunting horn? 🤔
[0:26:34] <%lucky_icarus> I would like Delirium to get some sort of bonus. its feels like a worst version of WAR variation.
[0:26:35] <%great_tj> Pat do you run the Extreme Dungeons aswell or always the Non-Hardcore content?
[0:26:35] <SinisterBroccoli> LUL
[0:26:35] <%JoshManVGH> Moar Party Buffs
[0:26:35] <+applemon198> gunbreaker buffs?
[0:26:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> Dancer fucks
[0:26:37] <%Sausious> THEY TOOK ALL ITS PARTY SUPPORT LIKE
[0:26:37] <baavetti> bard becomes the new healer
[0:26:38] <%Monkeyweed21> I wonder how they'll screw with SMN this time
[0:26:38] <arkaznor> It WILL NOT happen but I want samurai and Dragoon to share gear while Monk and Ninja share gear.
[0:26:39] <%ShawnTK_> Dancer is great, ignore bard
[0:26:39] <ZimmiZ> My friend is one of the top Bards in NA
[0:26:40] <%Puhff> turn bard into hunting horn
[0:26:41] <sjcodan> WHERE'S THE BUFFS GO
[0:26:41] <bestwaifuritsu> GIVE BARD A SMN BANE EQUIVELANT SKILL
[0:26:41] <YaBoiSquibs> SPITTIN FACTS BARD SUCKS LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
[0:26:41] <%TaifuDragon> Bard just needs number adjustment
[0:26:42] <%MrP33Ps> I love Bard's aesthetic so much, but it sucks
[0:26:42] <blastazoid00> Dancer made bard irrelevant
[0:26:43] <redrins> why play well with bard when other classes do just as much without nearly as much work
[0:26:43] <+Rose_Silvers> Bard has better RDPS than MCH
[0:26:43] <%tactician0> it all I do
[0:26:44] <Dodolo212> BRD was castrated, damn DNC
[0:26:44] <%abakkus> bard desperately needs something to guarantee procs bc its way too luck based rn
[0:26:45] <%MisterRockett> I like playing as BRD.
[0:26:46] <%wibbwobbler> lmao
[0:26:47] <%DeathsDoom> i want an AOE dot Spread
[0:26:47] <+MoManager> get BRD to 30 and stop
[0:26:49] <+abrupt_abe> DNC is a bit boring
[0:26:49] <+Raiden_Breaker> very fun to play
[0:26:51] <BigNerdSam> Bard only exists so you can go to Limsa and listen to Zelda music
[0:26:51] <%Sausious> I think DNC is a little too simple but i agree
[0:26:53] <jaggstar2020> let bard use perform during fights
[0:26:53] <%ashenfrenzy> GNB is fantastic
[0:26:54] <%Frost_Quill> I started with bard and I now main SMN/RDM.
[0:26:56] <+ForlornCarton> ForlornCarton subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[0:26:56] <+Mittastic> Monk JUST got overhaul
[0:26:56] <%Treuan> Super hoping for chemist
[0:26:57] <%patriotrenegade> I LIKE YOUR FUNNY WORDS, MAGIC MAN
[0:26:57] <+oroclvb> cant sit in limsa playing songs on dancer wheels bruh
[0:26:57] <%caramelatte1> yeye
[0:26:59] <+cvsz555> they're super fun
[0:26:59] <$Pompadourius> I wanna play more Gunbreaker but as someone who mains Paladin and Dark Knight, Gunbreaker's defensives make me feel naked.
[0:27:00] <%NopeBadguy> bard just doesn't shit out support and actual damage the same way
[0:27:01] <%alcors_wisdom> theres no possible way you could implement seducing the boss in a mmorpg
[0:27:06] <sjcodan> GNB feels like sex to play when you get going.
[0:27:07] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Dancer could use a good single-target meter user
[0:27:08] <%caramelatte1> New healer needs a good fun gimmick
[0:27:09] <%Sargonyx> GNB is the most fun class ive played in an MMO, especially once I mapped it to controller
[0:27:10] <%Retinolgaming> Bard becomes healer, SHOOT healing
[0:27:10] <%Sausious> Yeah i agree
[0:27:11] <%deathscythe122887> @PatStaresAt and now your character will now be super nerfed for the next couple of months out of DEV spite
[0:27:11] <+NeonLight> I love that DNC is procs on procs on procs on procs
[0:27:12] <%cowardman93> I was screaming for Gunbreaker since before Heavensward and I am so happy with it
[0:27:13] <DianaTheAscian> gnb is a bit to squishy for me
[0:27:13] <Finakala> Same as RDM
[0:27:13] <%Frost_Quill> "Hit level 50?"
[0:27:14] <jamsbybetty> I'm 71 GNB and it's kinda boooring
[0:27:17] <%snugglepuggs> DANCER STARTS AT 60
[0:27:18] <+Raiden_Breaker> yeah unlike blk
[0:27:18] <%Monkeyweed21> you start at 60
[0:27:19] <%Palhinuk> real talk, why is Dancer so fucking good? I was a SMN main and now I'm thinking about just switching over to DNC full time
[0:27:19] <%AllenDeadman> YEAH
[0:27:19] <+Kindan55> bard is a limsa optimised class
[0:27:21] <%hoodedlefty> the only thing bard has over dancer is having DoTs
[0:27:23] <%Frost_Quill> You start at 60.
[0:27:23] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Dancer is easily my favorite ranged dps
[0:27:23] <+emperri> MNK did not get an overhaul, it got a give up and remove greased lightning
[0:27:26] <Edajos> hit lvl 50?
[0:27:28] <%BoxNavy> i only play dancer cus im bad at every other class :)
[0:27:30] <Kain5707> Pat is this the right channel?
[0:27:30] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> What should they give BLM? Bigger explosion?
[0:27:32] <%Polter_ge1st> Regen on RDM please
[0:27:33] <+snausages_> Chemist should be like Ninja mudras with some AST style ogcd potion preparing or something
[0:27:33] <%skycladbrent> Yeah it makes doing old content more bearable
[0:27:33] <lelouchrequiem> @jamsbybetty wrong
[0:27:33] <%ScrapSentinel> Black Mage doesn't really get anywhere until max level it sucks
[0:27:34] <@PlagueOfGripes> Dancer starts at 60 Pat. Gosh, so dumb
[0:27:37] <%snugglepuggs> who does that?
[0:27:38] <%TaifuDragon> You can play dancer at like 30 AND IT'S STILL GOOD
[0:27:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> Scholar feels mis matched. to many of scholars abilites don't work with each other.
[0:27:39] <BigNerdSam> Dancer is Level 60
[0:27:39] <Basch71> its actually the best job at low level
[0:27:39] <%alcors_wisdom> how does the free trail in ff14 work again?
[0:27:39] <sjcodan> YOU SYNC DOWN FOR OTHER CONTNENT
[0:27:41] <%xain234> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about dancer having so much melee range though?
[0:27:42] <2DSuperiority> Me Dance Everything Die
[0:27:45] <%abakkus> yeah dancer is way better downsynced than any other class imo
[0:27:46] <maglebeast> I remember back a few patches, they said they were streamlining a lot of the early stuff. Did that stuff make it in already? Sorry if a dumb question. Haven't played FFXIV but it looks real cool so thinking about it.
[0:27:47] <%snugglepuggs> this is the left channe;
[0:27:47] <%Palhinuk> also @PatStaresAt how would you feel about Geomancer?
[0:27:48] <%Garthunox> you can play dancer at 15 and it SUCKS!
[0:27:49] <+DerKupo> i want astral heart as opposite of umbral heart. like, give me thee fire spells on activatipn that give me a little bit of mp back or something. like a cooldown or something
[0:27:49] <$Pompadourius> It literally says it is lmao
[0:27:49] <Forester_Skippy> dancer dps is insainly good at 50, 60 and 70
[0:27:50] <RamenRiderZ> I really hope the new healer is a chemist
[0:27:50] <Midnight188> a healer whose healing is also dps somehow
[0:27:52] <%chiazam> IS IT NOT OVERR!?!?
[0:27:53] <%AncelDeLambert> 60k
[0:27:55] <Midnight188> like crazy lifeleeching

[0:28:16] <+Ritei> geomancer has been dead since stormblood astro quests

[0:28:58] <Captain_matt> So what are your takes?
[0:28:59] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt You are still off center. You are a bit to the right from our perspective. The vertical line from your video outline is not in the center of your face.

[0:29:02] <InXplotch> what about rune knight?
[0:29:03] <Klauz91> matemathician
[0:29:03] <ReiDuran> Mediator
[0:29:04] <TerryTheTurret> By that logic the Pirate one you want is already there as MCH LUL
[0:29:05] <KaironFortressKnight> Which class announcement will make them show me like 10 seconds of new XVI gameplay
[0:29:05] <%transporterthesequel> Soldier, Judge, and Chemist LOCK IT IN
[0:29:05] <+swearinglotus> drug dealer?
[0:29:07] <+Kindan55> you think trailer will be the opener?
[0:29:07] <+neversawme321> They don't put the magic on the sword
[0:29:08] <ZimmiZ> Rune Fencer would have to be a Tank
[0:29:10] <%MrDrayko> and Chemist is in the game because alchemy exists, Pat

[0:29:13] <bbbbuttts1> Black mage 2

[0:29:16] <+Raiden_Breaker> Rune Knight but based off celes
[0:29:16] <+emperri> @PatStaresAt rune fencer in XI was a tank with a greatsword
[0:29:16] <%krispen_wa> Give us Lightning from FFXIII as a perfect god class that can do no wrong
[0:29:17] <$Pompadourius> @brosesarered Exorcist as a tank/healer though
[0:29:18] <sjcodan> WAR IS berserker
[0:29:18] <stormkingx21> wich they could add time mage
[0:29:18] <%snugglepuggs> Viking
[0:29:18] <A_Red_Robot> Warrior is already a Berserker though
[0:29:19] <maglebeast> Is RDM good in XIV? I remember playing one back in FFXI
[0:29:19] <xeros720> onion knight as a goof
[0:29:19] <Midnight188> Blitzballer as a dps class :P

[0:29:20] <%Treuan> I want chemist to spite my friend who told me it was a dumb pick
[0:29:20] <%kainhighwind1990> Isn't Berserker p much warrior
[0:29:21] <cizal11> Technically the runefencer they’re talking about is the ff11 version, which is basically just what dark knight is now but different flavor
[0:29:22] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I really want Hammer job
[0:29:22] <%TEANTACLES> rdm isn't a magic swordsman, runefencer would buff their own weapon with magic and play like melee dps
[0:29:23] <%Jungos60> Chemist and Necromancer!!!
[0:29:23] <+aslfrasle> Isn't Warrior just Berserker?
[0:29:23] <ZimmiZ> @PatStaresAt beastman
[0:29:23] <+cvsz555> WAR is kinda of a Berserker
[0:29:23] <%Frost_Quill> I want TIME MAGE as a MAGE TANK god fucking damn it.

[0:29:27] <last_sentra> Geomancer?
[0:29:29] <+KaiserKnuckles> Just gimmie Berserker
[0:29:30] <G_476> Beastmaster is 100% a limited job
[0:29:30] <OniHeart> geomancer
[0:29:32] <%Palhinuk> @PatStaresAt Gambler? I mean Corsair was basically Gambler in XI right?

[0:52:55] <+Breezeplease> Cleric stance is back
[0:52:56] <%ygtidal> self buffs?
[0:52:57] <some_brave_apollo> is it just because white mage is iconic that they deliberately make it better than the others?
[0:52:58] <Ubu2933> Healer goes brrrrrt
[0:52:58] <$apolitenoob> STANCE DANCING IS BACK
[0:52:59] <Iwashi94> @PatStaresAt the Japanese name for the Nouliths means something like "'Wisdom Tools"

[0:53:08] <xeros720> Sages play the game like a FPS, got it
[0:53:10] <+SmiteKnight> So I guess you'd want one barrier and one pure for raid?
[0:53:11] <%krispen_wa> Please look forward to it
[0:53:11] <%hoodedlefty> the transition from SCH to Sage will be smooth, wonder if Sage will take over as my main...

[0:53:55] <mythrilcrafter> afk cat girls an pirates in limsa!
[0:53:55] <InXplotch> will they actually split them in queuing? I didnt hear that
[0:53:56] <%Mr_Bop> he said funnel!
[0:54:00] <+snausages_> I think they are bad changes
[0:54:01] <%mikessdd> Limsa
[0:54:01] <afronooch> he said gundam
[0:54:03] <xeros720> ahahaha, NO COMMENT about gundams
[0:54:03] <+Doombarr> gundamu
[0:54:05] <%Monkeyweed21> its Raid Finder only
[0:54:06] <Mega_Driver> TILL SEA SWALLOWS ALL
[0:54:08] <DianaTheAscian> ITS FUNNELS
[0:54:08] <+SiegmundCG> nobody will play pure healer in the story, fuck queues
[0:54:10] <%caramelatte1> Yeah it sucks when you get double Sch, not enough healing
[0:54:10] <lightmonarch1> he said gundam
[0:54:11] <+ShutUpAceyP> it shouldn't affect queues but party finder
[0:54:12] <Zahrtreiv> best parties are ones that have both anyway
[0:54:12] <+snausages_> AST seems like it will be dumbed down and sects not as useful
[0:54:13] <Hydrapissed> lol ORGINAL
[0:54:13] <BoSteed> OC DO NOT STEAL
[0:54:14] <%chiluzza> so with Astrologian becoming pure healer its technically 2.5 classes
[0:54:15] <cardamomo88> ok give me dps now
[0:54:15] <+Walopoh> No Comment :)
[0:54:17] <CastellanVon> Yeah AST has kinda fucked up the balance for a long time

[0:54:18] <jillpilled> GUNDUM
[0:54:21] <%WhereIsWill> completely original Kappa
[0:54:21] <jerkhov_> trials stay the same
[0:54:24] <+GIGA255> Nouliths will look great with the "Late Allagan" PvP gear
[0:54:25] <$Pompadourius> The LB3 for Sage better just call down a nondescript Gundam to heal
[0:54:27] <%transporterthesequel> Totally not definitely GUNDAMS
[0:54:29] <%AzureGale> ROLL 212
[0:54:30] <%QueequegTheater> I mean, the fight against Sapphire was already blatantly Gundam

[1:12:02] <T_Sasquatch> YOU ARE MY FRIENDDDD AHHHH
[1:12:03] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Zenos mentions getting a new Weapon for our Fight. So It's totally REAVER
[1:12:03] <%hamborgini> having not finished stormblood, I'm disappointed to see that nerd still around
[1:12:05] <+213372bu> Zenos not dying in 5.5 confirmed I guess
[1:12:05] <CastellanVon> Zenos: "I will never be a memory my friend!"
[1:12:06] <%BluBarracuda> Xenos is a creeper
[1:12:06] <Amadeusguy> Zenos really needs to learn how to take a hint
[1:12:06] <Ubu2933> Or he is another part of our soul and we are going to eat him
[1:12:06] <%Medrex> UUB HIM AND FORCE REINCARNATE WITH NO MEMORY
[1:12:07] <+Saanspoof> Zenos gets KARS'd
[1:12:07] <%shadowsofpain> what if we absorb him ala ardbert?

[1:12:11] <%caramelatte1> Zenos will get eaten by Genova on the moon and become Sephiroth
[1:12:12] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt People say he sucks, but consider: Zenos wearing Vegeta's BADMAN shirt
[1:12:13] <An_Armed_Bear> I want him to just get murked by something else, get denied his wish to fight us
[1:12:14] <@commanderclaw> His forehead has his JO crystal

[1:54:07] <%Quigsies> Ok
[1:54:08] <+TheEvilOmega> Thank goodness. Leveling takes so damn long.
[1:54:08] <jerkhov_> it's just divisoin
[1:54:08] <fuji_92> ok
[1:54:09] <%kyh9> Level requirements will proabbly be consistent
[1:54:09] <%natscazz> ah okay that is equivalent then
[1:54:09] <%BinaryFireball> this is such a sloppy way of dealing with this
[1:54:10] <last_sentra> Less palace!
[1:54:10] <+DraggoonLord> LEVELING NOT SUCKING????
[1:54:10] <ScrubTheNerd> I hope exp gain isn't lowered
[1:54:12] <+cvsz555> just moving the scale
[1:54:14] <Go4theKnees> please make leveling faster
[1:54:18] <roguemephilesclone> PogChamp
[1:54:18] <$Pompadourius> Yep.
[1:54:20] <%shurtal> Hell yes

[1:54:21] <Calamity2007> Leveling go faster
[1:54:22] <JQWeeaboo> itll be the malboros in aurum vale
[1:54:23] <$Pompadourius> Good for the farmers.
[1:54:23] <%marsantas> Good!
[1:54:24] <+abrupt_abe> Stat squishes tend to cause that
[1:54:24] <%shadowace2400> yay
[1:54:25] <AoiRob> EVERYTHING IS NERFED
[1:54:25] <%lucky_icarus> FUCK YEAH
[1:54:25] <Hydrapissed> the END of the world
[1:54:25] <+LandOfTheWay> good
[1:54:25] <ZimmiZ> good
[1:54:27] <jerkhov_> solo stb already
[1:54:28] <jillpilled> seems it
[1:54:29] <%transporterthesequel> I can't wait till they forget to adjust PvP experience gain.
[1:54:29] <+drexxel1> Thank god another point for you FF14, leveling is always been a rough spot. Good on them
[1:54:30] <+vaderxyz1970> SOLO OMEGA SAVAGE
[1:54:31] <+alphonseisbest> GOOD
[1:54:31] <%great_tj> just look at WoW
[1:54:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Maybe Bahamut will finally be doable solo
[1:54:34] <$Futurecity10> Zodiac Weapon farming gets even easier
[1:54:34] <InXplotch> I wonder if this means gear lasts way longer in 50-80, so tome gear lasts all the way through
[1:54:34] <+luftraumm1> can't you just slap a x0.5 addy the end of the code?
[1:54:36] <+Maswrath> Solo 80 extremes
[1:54:36] <%mikessdd> Yeah I would like to do unsynced solos easier
[1:54:37] <$Pompadourius> Good, good
[1:54:37] <Forester_Skippy> if its gonna be like wow you can unsync everything till current
[1:54:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ScrubTheNerd They're lowering gained, but also required, so it'll functionally be the same.
[1:54:37] <+Pyroclase> Maybe we'll get to be like WoW and they do a stat squish every expansion
[1:54:37] <$StrawberryPantsu> HAHA TIME TO GET ALL MY DOGS AND DRAGONS SOLO
[1:54:39] <TheMadBadger> @ScrubTheNerd They literally just said it will be, but so will max exp needed. So, no real change
[1:54:39] <bestwaifuritsu> No Uncle Yoshi, I dont wanna go back to doing Castrum everyday
[1:54:40] <jerkhov_> kirito players
[1:54:40] <SolsticeZr0> Solo o12s ez
[1:54:41] <+NeonLight> I would assume it means that lvl 90s unsynced against say Shiva and Emerald would be roughly the same
[1:54:42] <penitentpendant> So BLU may be easier?
[1:54:42] <iosephe> wouldn't it be the opposite though?
[1:54:43] <%DedlokPM> @ScrubTheNerd gain lowered, but so is the total needed to level
[1:54:45] <%shadowsofpain> walk into bahamut at slap his shit
[1:54:45] <+Shadowofadoubt> Everything go down for the code
[1:54:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt solo arr extreme clears in 20 sec
[1:54:49] <%Gondab> LV 90 DRK VS coils
[1:54:53] <%QueequegTheater> I COULD DO IT
[1:54:53] <TerryTheTurret> Bahamut can already be soloed
[1:54:53] <+ShutUpAceyP> you can already solo bahamut
[1:54:54] <$zyberion626> so literally everything is going down x%
[1:54:54] <+Kindan55> Already kinda is
[1:54:54] <bbbbuttts1> Solo TEA
[1:54:56] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> cant, Ultimate is always synced
[1:54:56] <$zyberion626> that's fine
[1:54:56] <NagiHayatori> just don't unbalance everything on accident please
[1:54:56] <+emperri> it should be the opposite mathematically
[1:54:56] <%shurtal> REAL Warrior of Light Shit
[1:55:01] <gachabasta> Hell yeah
[1:55:02] <%WhereIsWill> this MIGHT make blu feel better
[1:55:02] <%jyeowa> RESULT: number go down
[1:55:03] <SonicD4> I still havent fought Bahamut
[1:55:05] <%Forente> but number go down?
[1:55:05] <$Pompadourius> Maybe those two annoying bosses in the Coils can be soloed easier now. lmao
[1:55:05] <jerkhov_> just nerf Coils already
[1:55:06] <%krispen_wa> Coils is already soloable
[1:55:06] <%shadowsofpain> Nel explodes
[1:55:08] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> That's a good message
[1:55:09] <+king_of_beggars> He's lying we're being weakened.
[1:55:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everything will be RELATIVELY the same.
[1:55:13] <Hydrapissed> 5kk
[1:55:13] <+Captbutt> madara sexyca?

[1:55:20] <roguemephilesclone> MATH BOSS! MATH BOSS!
[1:55:21] <+Maswrath> I solo'd final coils normal with DRK
[1:55:22] <Srthunda> people would go insane for no reason
[1:55:23] <+drexxel1> The amount of detail they're going into with the squish is mint. Gameplay side of FF14 has always been stellar with this stuff.
[1:55:23] <fuji_92> IT DOES YOSHI P, IT DOES
[1:55:23] <jerkhov_> small brains will still complain after this
[1:55:24] <+Neoripo> REEEing ensues
[1:55:27] <Hydrapissed> but my BIG number
[1:55:28] <+emperri> which people will do anyway
[1:55:29] <%krispen_wa> nael can be solo'd fairly easily alteady

[2:33:41] <Bluewolf544> Gunslinger
[2:33:41] <Ciglossonjr> What’s the next stream?
[2:33:44] <lucas18293> I want a mage tank that uses buffs to defend themselves. it'd be cool if they had reflect or something
[2:33:44] <%hoodedlefty> we got Seven's gun drones lol
[2:33:44] <Cykaima> i missed sageeeee
[2:33:46] <+GIGA255> I wonder if the new Melee DPS will share scouting gear or maiming gear. ninja and dragoon are the only classes that dont share at the moment.
[2:33:57] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> ;_;
[2:34:05] <Cykaima> i want a maiming judge so bad
[2:34:05] <%BoxNavy> i want a class with a big anchor
[2:34:06] <$Pompadourius> @GIGA255 If it's Corsair I could see them sharing with Scouting.
[2:34:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Warrior has hammers
[2:34:10] <%BoxNavy> do that yoshi p
[2:34:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Reaver or Reaper

[2:34:54] <gorillahandz> god imagine
[2:34:55] <viewtifulr> Give me ranged dps Blitzball i wont be quiet
[2:35:00] <%HiroTSK5> Sage is from FFIII
[2:35:01] <Edajos> Sage isn't new at all
[2:35:06] <Edajos> just the weapon is new
[2:35:09] <BerryliciousDefinition> Of Ellen fame?
[2:35:13] <%baronblank> shot in the dark guess: melee dps is based on tidus with tidus swordplay and blitzball like how gunbreaker is based on squall
[2:35:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> he means the weapons yeah
[2:35:24] <%Birdigalore> Sage in FF3 was just a better white mage
[2:35:25] <+LandOfTheWay> literally the first place we go, yeah
[2:35:27] <+NeonLight> Garlean capital is probably the first dungeon before it gets nuked
[2:35:29] <Lewtskie> yeah garlemald got the ff15 treatment
[2:35:29] <$Pompadourius> Heero Yuy cosplay for Sage?
[2:35:29] <Edajos> Melee DPS is gonna be Templar

[2:35:34] <$Afterman_> garlemead is actually super fucked because theyre a war society
[2:35:37] <+IvoryVIII> They would not showcase it if it was the final one lol
[2:35:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the moon itself is prob the last one
[2:35:39] <+Maswrath> Final zone's the moon
[2:35:41] <%baronblank> what is templar
[2:35:43] <Midnight188> we finally get to see more of Ilsabard and its just RUINS
[2:35:45] <%amused_platypus> were gonna do a bravely second and blow up the moon
[2:35:49] <%hoodedlefty> ok but I called Garlemald as a zone
[2:35:52] <$Pompadourius> Moon is gonna be the last zone for sure.
[2:35:53] <%Monkeyweed21> first 2 zones will be Thavnair and Garlemald like Kholusia and Amh Areng
[2:35:54] <%Gondab> @viewtifulr its a meele DPS, so they will just smack someone with a blitzball
[2:35:55] <Bluewolf544> The moon is final zone for SURE
[2:36:02] <%AzureGale> BibleThump
[2:36:06] <+spacenoido> literally everyone called garlemald being a zone
[2:36:13] <%roscoe_rosaline> God I wand to get braces man

Had a convo a while ago about RE7 coming out during a time when RE was kind of not in the finest state, would you agree or disagree that RE7 was a risky move with the change in perspective and content aside from the return to more classic survival horror
[2:43:00] <%SomeSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt IKR??

[2:44:52] <%Hilleltaco> Addendum to my message, I was calling Sage "gun mage" without realizing gun mage was a real job lol. Can you tell I haven't played enough Final Fantasy games psaLiz
[2:44:54] <%wibbwobbler> vods aren't a thing anymore
[2:44:55] <+mortalmanbaby> "Give shadow lord a big sloppy kiss"
[2:44:57] <%Monkeyweed21> OH GOD THE MOON IS GOING TO BE COCOON FROM FF13
[2:45:01] <Scoobles64> pat's call outs are way more fun when you're actually here live
[2:45:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I've tried and they say pay up lol. I didnt know they got rid of VODs
[2:45:04] <ManfredA> pandemonium is a 2 thing I think
[2:45:04] <Srthunda> for some reason people want the other class to be a limited class and I do not understand
[2:45:05] <$Pompadourius> @PatStaresAt You gonna stream the 5.5 liveletter or nah?
[2:45:07] <afronooch> no, why would we do that?
[2:45:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> clearly crazy talk is spreading to the fans
[2:45:17] <ShinMaxRebo> it's all just a subtle Killer is Dead crossover

[2:45:40] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @ShinMaxRebo YOOO thats whatsup
[2:45:41] <%PadreHail> I don't think they got rid of VoDs I can still watch past streams of stuff like DoubleToasted despite not being subbed
[2:45:47] <ToneBacas> nice
[2:45:47] <$Pompadourius> ?????
[2:45:51] <%Monkeyweed21> if they do Reaper then maiming, pirate would be scouting

[2:45:54] <%PadreHail> Good job Patrick
[2:45:56] <ToneBacas> censored message, chat
[2:45:56] <%BoxNavy> youre so cool
[2:46:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Kirby_Sauce No, chat's stand ONE GUY is just Crazy Talk's inbred cousin
[2:46:06] <roguemephilesclone> Perfect.
[2:46:07] <ToneBacas> i mean it was a private thing probably
[2:46:22] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> not that risky cuz PT was lit
[2:46:31] <theanora1> it wasn't risky, it was cribbing PT
[2:46:41] <%Monkeyweed21> its great until you get to the ship and the mines
[2:46:41] <$Pompadourius> 7.0 returns to ARR areas for its plot? That would be kinda cool.
[2:46:42] <xxshadowxx416> no story
[2:46:44] <$Pompadourius> An altered Eorzea.
[2:46:49] <%HiroTSK5> Whatever happened to XI?
[2:46:51] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:46:52] <%mikessdd> I was thinking after some of the last story stuff that maybe they're setting up Corsair
[2:46:53] <%Alazull> I'm guessing 6.x will be the Cataclysm event
[2:46:55] <@JustinianKnight> XI still going
[2:46:56] <%PadreHail> I don't get the PT cribbing cuz they're entirely different experiences
[2:46:56] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[2:46:56] <%Monkeyweed21> 7.0 would be the new world prolly
[2:46:57] <Midnight188> take the pruning shears to ARR
[2:46:59] <%Agami23> maybe when people can get a ps5
[2:46:59] <Ciglossonjr> Ps5 limitation splease understamnd
