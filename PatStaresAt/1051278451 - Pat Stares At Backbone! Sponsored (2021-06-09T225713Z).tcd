[0:20:21] <+fetrigon> 50,000 concurrent players ye
[0:20:21] <%dekkitout> You mean the thing where the game just holds in limbo- nothing else moves, etc?
[0:20:26] <%NopeBadguy> Is it okay if I send you a ROT13 about a big ME2 thing that pays off in ME3?
[0:20:28] <%Daxalog> its a Sega mmo. Not surprising
[0:20:30] <%RoninRorinth> another update for rift apart
[0:20:31] <%Ipsenscastle> Max seemed to have a great time with it pre-release, are the problems new?
[0:20:34] <%saladin1911> @rumtumtugnutz Ah, fair enough then. Cheers
[0:20:35] <+Mechanized82> seems stable-ish now

[0:21:12] <%Jekado> @NopeBadguy thats what i call it!
[0:21:22] <$Futurecity10> Just emulate the gamecube phantasy star and use hamachi
[0:21:26] <viciousgrim> i can't even play steam keeps say it needs a update
[0:21:33] <%TheWinged7> thats how it was in base, idk if they changed it
[0:21:38] <+Mechanized82> There are over 100 30 player rooms on ship 2 and they're almost all full
[0:21:50] <+NickNackProductions> either buy a ship transfer or just make a new character lol. they might add universal ship activies later down the line but who knows

[0:33:37] <%twistedj3ster> He got the B Pass
[0:34:16] <jorniev> PAT playing a snuffy video game
[0:34:21] <stealthfart> I love games that feature anthropomorphic animals in cool ways, but I dislike how people hate on them for being “furry.” I genuinely wonder how many pieces of media and art we have missed out on because of this.
[0:34:26] <%MugenSandan> hey Pat I've had all 5G's installed when should I expect super powers
[0:34:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Do you think this world has Skinnies instead of Furries?

[0:36:05] <Rionxgarland> i sorta hate woth furry stuff how in a world like this i think is cool things become animal like to the point of absurdity like woofbank it makes it hard mfor me to see this as a world
[0:36:23] <yourliteraldog> Animals are fun
[0:36:27] <Rionxgarland> wow that was bad
[0:36:36] <%Monkeyweed21> So in this world, would it be Skinnies and instead of yiffing they go YEEHAW?

[1:18:25] <+Punchasaur> Thought so
[1:18:29] <Lieutenant_America> @JobbedBone I was also referring to both of them being pathetic to everyone around them. Nobody gives Howard a shred of respect, let alone Harry
[1:18:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Howard needs to volumetrically compress his shit
[1:18:37] <+Meiou> @kingmemelord97 wait your implying theres something other than the brb screen?

[1:27:40] <+evbites> @Punchasaur the type of bear where the advice is "pray for your life "
[1:27:53] <yourliteraldog> Polar Bears starve in the summer time cause they can't catch babies of gaurd
