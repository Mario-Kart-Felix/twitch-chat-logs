[0:21:17] <beerdysonthehunt> i love video games!
[0:21:18] <cipher758> elmo is hiding his power level
[0:21:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt I haven't been able to keep up, has the DLC had any epic music like the ashtray maze?
[0:21:33] <blue6sub6remnant6> Elmo's Zantesuken is back.
[0:21:36] <%realm_forge> Baby geif has that muscle armor that can stop a sword tho
[0:21:38] <%honeyman18> Are we doing the maze sequence on Loop?
[0:21:40] <+Mkingston> why not 12?
[0:21:44] <%KaseTriedAgain> psaDab psaDab
[0:21:46] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It reminds me of when my aunt's puggle kept trying to pick a fight with my formerly outdoor street cat. It was like watching a prep school athlete trying to fight a public school bully
[0:21:46] <%stabbityrabbit> Ah yeah, jumped in at the perfect time.
[0:22:02] <%AncelDeLambert> she can't, Pat, she is TINY
[0:22:03] <MarylandJutsu> and has gief found a spot on yall bed that he likes?

[0:22:36] <%weissguard> Thanks for the HyperMayhem @stewthegreat
[0:22:40] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As a bulldog owner, you will literally NEVER get the bed back once he sleeps on it once
[0:22:45] <MarylandJutsu> gottt ya
[0:22:46] <$QueequegTheater> It will be his
[0:22:48] <MarylandJutsu> makes sense
[0:22:49] <marvel877> Only Pat is allowed to pee the bed.
[0:23:06] <MarylandJutsu> @marvel877 and elmo
[0:23:07] <%ClericOfSparda> Things Zangief has peed on: Everything except Elmo
[0:23:17] <%a_goth_pancake> that outfit looks amazing
[0:23:31] <%AncelDeLambert> did they add more upgrades?
[0:23:38] <%honeyman18> Throwing shield helps
[0:23:41] <%CalderGaming> save up for that multi-launch
[0:23:44] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Alright I'm actually at work on a deadline so I should probably go...do...that
[0:23:46] <$QueequegTheater> Bye
[0:24:03] <MarylandJutsu> bye queequeg you horrible gremlin
[0:24:08] <beerdysonthehunt> break yo self, fool
[0:24:10] <rariirar> oh you magnificent sexy beast. do the truffle shuffle.
[0:24:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm a little curious how much better the combat is on PC
[0:24:20] <beerdysonthehunt> good and bad
[0:24:21] <%king_wragles> Good
[0:24:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Good
[0:24:23] <DukeBlack_> bad
[0:24:23] <%YakumoYomi> Good
[0:24:30] <+JustToWatch> voices are kinda quiet
[0:24:31] <lyzejag> Pretty good
[0:24:33] <fuji_92> good bad
[0:24:36] <%einheri> fine
[0:24:45] <%skyentombment> Man, I already own a big ol labrador, but seeing Gief really makes me wanna have a lil puppo
[0:24:45] <%YakumoYomi> ASStral Bleed. Nailed it.
[0:24:46] <Ell1ot> i couldn't hear it over Pat's GoodBad
[0:24:47] <%Birdigalore> Some fiber will help stop that astral bleed
[0:24:52] <MarylandJutsu> decent for me
[0:24:53] <DingusMcBaseball> LUL
[0:24:55] <cipher758> you're pretty good
[0:24:56] <DraxTD> Ga'nadad, Pat
[0:24:56] <+pyrojack6> Yo, how well do the MSQs help when trying to raise your item level in FF14
[0:25:00] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S why I didn't like the combat! I fucking hate RNG upgrades!
[0:25:14] <%Deekman> have you replayed alan wake lately? This is better
[0:25:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I totally forgot about the weapon ugrades, goddamn I hate random drops
[0:25:22] <+ALazo> When's Alan Wake
[0:25:30] <%Deekman> (except for the light room)
[0:25:35] <%arancet> i liked alan wake on release, but find it super boring every time i try to replay it for some reason
[0:25:45] <%bread_assassin> I wasn't a fan of this DLC. Exploring the cave is less interesting than the office building like the rest of the main game.
[0:25:46] <silverira> Alan Wake sucks comparing to this the best thing about it is the setting
[0:25:48] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, are we double crossing The Board?
[0:25:53] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't that suicidal?
[0:26:01] <%NWR_James> NWR_James subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Almost 2 years? And we're still here? I'm out of stupid things to say, so lets just pretend it was really good and move on.
[0:26:03] <%Piemono> Man without the DLC this character just disappears
[0:26:04] <%D00msDayDan> why isn't she smoking
[0:26:13] <WiredAbyss> I wish American Nightmare was good
[0:26:21] <%Lion_kun> WHERE'S DARLING!?!
[0:26:24] <PirateMike_> So whats the appeal in this game a good story? or....
[0:26:26] <%CalderGaming> @pyrojack6 they just hand you a full set of lvl 110 gear each for caster and physical each throughout 2.1-2.5
[0:26:32] <%rottingpastry> Hey look it's Amanda Waller
[0:26:38] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaand dead
[0:26:41] <%AncelDeLambert> I FUCKING HATE THE FLYING
[0:26:53] <PirateMike_> Or is it the gameplay?
[0:26:58] <%CalderGaming> whoops said "each" twice
[0:27:02] <%rottingpastry> I can't believe you chose fracture, what an awful choice!
[0:27:18] <%AncelDeLambert> this game has an excellent setting, BEAUTIFUL visuals, an amazing soundtrack, and some truly solid acting
[0:27:31] <Clowns> darling is busy making music videos in the astral plane or wherever
[0:27:32] <%CalderGaming> @PirateMike_ good writing and visual design. gameplay may or may not appeal to you
[0:27:53] <%CalderGaming> audio design too
[0:28:02] <$Dakuu75> SO, how's the DLC so far? I haven't been able to catch much of the control stream lately
[0:28:03] <%AncelDeLambert> at least the costume she has on is good
[0:28:06] <Hydrapissed> its bi
[0:28:09] <PirateMike_> Good writing sounds good
[0:28:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I hated all the costumes in teh main game

[0:29:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 29m 15s.
[0:29:07] <%BinaryFireball> This game is like a more complex version of you got peanutbutter in my jelly
[0:29:07] <%Razputin217> Answer me, Science!
[0:29:13] <$Dakuu75> @PirateMike_ lol
[0:29:15] <Clowns> this *is* werepat
[0:29:17] <%honeyman18> So is this all the red sand from the dimension the hiss came from?
[0:29:24] <+JustToWatch> the pillar back there had breakable parts
[0:29:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dear Nature: Seriously, what the fuck? Love, John.
[0:29:34] <+Regigangster> Oh and he turns into a normal person off stream?
[0:29:36] <%CalderGaming> @honeyman18 unclear!
[0:30:00] <$Dakuu75> I forget what the plot of control is. she's basically the new leader of an SCP foundation, right?
[0:30:07] <+Regigangster> Gun, the answer to everything
[0:30:18] <Clowns> @Dakuu75 close enough
[0:30:19] <%CalderGaming> @Dakuu75 yes
[0:30:40] <%a_goth_pancake> man, I need to get back to this game
[0:30:40] <$Zalthia> Did I miss the big bug???
[0:30:41] <+JustToWatch> you missed a breakable thing
[0:30:51] <+dmtjinni> PAT!
[0:30:55] <%rottingpastry> Noise ghosts.
[0:30:59] <PirateMike_> It's basically half life 1 with ghosts instead of aliens
[0:31:00] <%suikudo> did she ever find her brother?
[0:31:02] <%Deekman> nailed it
[0:31:04] <LorcaNomad> pretty accurate
[0:31:07] <+Regigangster> Is.. she an SCP?
[0:31:13] <Clowns> get fucked, breakable thing
[0:31:14] <$Zalthia> Has Pat met the big friend yet? Did I miss it? D:
[0:31:17] <lyzejag> -2
[0:31:19] <KCFusecoast> Good to see you back and streaming Pat. Are you playing this on PC?
[0:31:23] <%king_wragles> boooooooooooooooooo
[0:31:24] <$KnivesEve> which dlc is this?
[0:31:24] <%afronooch> idgi
[0:31:29] <LorcaNomad> Jesse is not an SCP, but her gun is
[0:31:35] <s0lesurviv0r> the nail, "Kushinada's Lynchpin"?
[0:31:35] <%Deekman> The nail & The Board. Do you get it
[0:31:42] <+Regigangster> Why fly though?
[0:31:43] <%rottingpastry> Don't pause the game tho lol
[0:31:44] <+warlockwithapixie> Thanks for the HyperCrown! I don't know what it is. @nwr_james
[0:31:49] <%Cozy90> i love crunchy
[0:31:50] <+Regigangster> And the psychic powers
[0:31:51] <+warlockwithapixie> oh emote
[0:31:52] <KCFusecoast> Oh nice! So they updated it through Steam then?
[0:31:53] <%king_wragles> Your stream was full of bees?
[0:31:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Did the Baby Dismiss Pat yet
[0:32:13] <+JustToWatch> the is that pillar near the entrance breakable?
[0:32:20] <KCFusecoast> Its looks good now like they upscaled it much better for UHD quality
[0:32:21] <%honeyman18> Slam to land cool and far
[0:32:25] <$Zalthia> !uptime
[0:32:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 32m 35s.
[0:32:26] <+ALazo> She walked in looking for her bro, shit was fucked, previous head of scp was dead, she became head because idk, she mostly unfucks things, the end.
[0:32:30] <KCFusecoast> And they fixed the lag
[0:32:31] <chambatron> Kinda weird Pat has 500- viewers today?
[0:32:35] <%rottingpastry> control point haze
[0:32:48] <+Regigangster> I get Death Stranding vibes from this game
[0:32:49] <%CalderGaming> I love that clip so much
[0:32:55] <Pookiedaexzile> When did everyone decide to fly like Ironman
[0:32:59] <%rottingpastry> She became head for...reeeeeasons
[0:33:02] <%Deekman> that's so good
[0:33:08] <%ClericOfSparda> That's a good dress code exception
[0:33:14] <+Regigangster> Like, what if you did something more interesting in the Death Stranding universe
[0:33:15] <%NeoCre> She’s not an SCP, but she has the ability to bond with a huge number of SCPs and draw out their full potential.
[0:33:17] <%Deekman> what was the thing inside jessie? I can't remember
[0:33:17] <Clowns> doesn't the director's office have windows? 🤔
[0:33:24] <%ClericOfSparda> I wish my company was that lenient
[0:33:25] <yourliteraldog> Why does she look like neo now
[0:33:27] <%Cozy90> EEEYAH
[0:33:32] <+spinalwizard> Polaris
[0:33:36] <%honeyman18> I am convinced they just opened a portal to a metal album cover
[0:33:37] <%Razputin217> Polaris
[0:33:39] <ZComiX> This is more GOC to me just because thet dont use D-CLass
[0:33:40] <+Regigangster> @NeoCre That sounds SUPER like what an SCP is though
[0:33:43] <$RealThiele> she is The One
[0:33:43] <%rottingpastry> It's a costume you can get by fighting yourself in a mirror room
[0:33:48] <$Zalthia> You gunna try and get the cat ears?
[0:33:56] <%CalderGaming> @Deekman Polaris, a benevolent version of the Hiss
[0:33:58] <PirateMike_> lol
[0:34:00] <yourliteraldog> It is basically an scp game
[0:34:15] <$RealThiele> yea this is SCP with a dev budget
[0:34:15] <%Deekman> @CalderGaming thanks. God it's been a while since I played that part
[0:34:17] <PirateMike_> why are these monstars wearing pants
[0:34:22] <%rottingpastry> Control is full of easter eggs. This expansion has a hidden cat ears accessory
[0:34:24] <LorcaNomad> on a scale of 1 to fuck yeah, how excited is the pat for the alen wake content?
[0:34:27] <Clowns> it was my understanding that directors are chosen because they're kind of anomalous to begin with and that's required for the job
[0:34:37] <+Regigangster> @PirateMike_ For the modesty
[0:34:41] <%Cozy90> theyre monsters not "MONSTERS"
[0:34:41] <$Dakuu75> what happened to all those ppl floating in the building. did they get saved or they all died?
[0:34:52] <KnightAsteran> this still Foundation?
[0:34:54] <%CalderGaming> they were dead
[0:34:55] <ZComiX> dead
[0:34:59] <$Zalthia> @Dakuu75 They're all dead. If they're floating it's too late.
[0:35:02] <%rottingpastry> I finished AWE on Friday, it is good content.
[0:35:02] <%CalderGaming> still foundation
[0:35:05] <Clowns> @Dakuu75 oh they ded.
[0:35:07] <PirateMike_> free the penis
[0:35:14] <PirateMike_> #freethepenis
[0:35:17] <%rottingpastry> Er Thursday today is Friday
[0:35:17] <+Regigangster> Just because you bad guy doesnt mean you need to be BAD guy
[0:35:21] <$RealThiele> penis club
[0:35:23] <yourliteraldog> Supernatural Hazmat Teams and Surrounding bureaucracy is severely under under utilized
[0:35:23] <KnightAsteran> cool, whats the story so far? I missed the first stream of the dlc
[0:35:24] <Clowns> if you didn't have an HRA, you're dead.
[0:35:39] <+Regigangster> #Freenis
[0:35:41] <silverira> quick grab the NatGeo logo
[0:35:53] <%kujofire990> squeek
[0:35:53] <$RealThiele> astral plane is leaking in dlc, fix a pillarman to win
[0:35:53] <%rottingpastry> There's this weird obelisk in the "basement" of the Oldest House and it's all fucked up
[0:35:58] <$Zalthia> Squeak squeak?
[0:35:58] <%CalderGaming> Pat Will Figure It Out
[0:36:06] <%honeyman18> They pop into hiss when you shoot them so I assume they died or stopped existing in our reality
[0:36:12] <+scrumbotime> Dig Up
[0:36:16] <$Dakuu75> maybe that's a big stone basketball hoop? you gotta throw the gold thin in through the top
[0:36:19] <%rottingpastry> I think the Hiss tried to blow it up? It might come up. Anyway, you gotta fix the obelisk. The Nail.
[0:36:23] <WiredAbyss> Up
[0:36:24] <yourliteraldog> Yeah obleskis tend to be evil most cases
[0:36:24] <penitentpentwitch> Goal!
[0:36:26] <+G_Thunders> @knightasteran Something broke the “Nail” and the Board wants you to fix it, since it’s the part of the foundation keeping reality together
[0:36:27] <@SoFarFetched> the SCP's are squeaking
[0:36:33] <ZComiX> Plot: Basically the cheif of security Marshall was hiding the place you are in RN, she has hgone missing and the board wants to you fix the Nail, a device that keeps them able to control this area.
[0:36:35] <LorcaNomad> good puzzle
[0:36:39] <PirateMike_> That squeeky toy sounds like a monkey
[0:36:39] <KnightAsteran> radical
[0:36:47] <$RealThiele> Vex trial
[0:36:52] <%rottingpastry> The Nail might be the roots of the world tree, but who knows
[0:36:58] <PanicSwytch> Is Zangief playing with a squeaky toy?
[0:37:02] <KnightAsteran> r a d
[0:37:08] <WiredAbyss> He got there
[0:37:13] <yourliteraldog> Is there any new powers in this dlc
[0:37:21] <%rottingpastry> Seize is fantastic.
[0:37:36] <penitentpentwitch> I like the utility of Seize, I just with the cast speed on it was a bit faster
[0:37:45] <Timurine> Outfit looks weird
[0:37:49] <KnightAsteran> it didn't go into the slot looks like
[0:37:49] <%rottingpastry> You can get mods to speed it up
[0:38:03] <%rottingpastry> I think I have one that's like +90% speed?
[0:38:15] <%CalderGaming> @yourliteraldog yeah. pat chose "be able to shoot the green crystals" over "be able to grow new green crystals," and you can unlock multi-throw and some other sutff
[0:38:18] <KnightAsteran> didn't you throw it in already
[0:38:19] <ahmz1404> I thought you already threw it in
[0:38:25] <%Ipsenscastle> it's right there
[0:38:28] <WiredAbyss> Will he figure it out?
[0:38:33] <%CalderGaming> maybe there's a blockage
[0:38:33] <yourliteraldog> Cool
[0:38:33] <Daskolin> Its stuck
[0:38:35] <%arancet> i think i saw it sitting in the column
[0:38:41] <%StewTheGreat> it's in there it's just being blocked by the crystals
[0:38:41] <KnightAsteran> then look at the thing and see if it just didn't land right
[0:38:42] <+NitronStreams> how can this be?
[0:38:48] <%Ascethetic> i think it was behind the right pillar
[0:38:48] <%rottingpastry> As far as I know, you never have to go back.
[0:38:49] <%arancet> in the column, but not quite socketed
[0:38:52] <fuji_92> i think its stuck behind the pillar
[0:38:57] <+Crimsonpajamas > its in there but did not land right
[0:39:02] <$Dakuu75> maybe it's stuck, yeah
[0:39:07] <PanicSwytch> Is this a combat dlc only or is there story also?
[0:39:13] <%StewTheGreat> it's not the physics
[0:39:15] <Clowns> unstick it
[0:39:19] <%Jaxnos> that's amazing
[0:39:20] <%StewTheGreat> look at the back of the column
[0:39:22] <%StewTheGreat> yeah
[0:39:23] <+frankietr3> Pat is stinky
[0:39:23] <%rottingpastry> lol puzzles!
[0:39:28] <yourliteraldog> I imagine growing crustles is like an ice spike type power
[0:39:30] <+NitronStreams> PUZZLES
[0:39:33] <WiredAbyss> @panicswytch story too
[0:39:36] <penitentpentwitch> Enforced ability use
[0:39:59] <yourliteraldog> yeet
[0:40:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> PUZZLES?!
[0:40:03] <KnightAsteran> @patstaresat how did you find the puzzle for this years Rising event? did you have to get paige to help you?
[0:40:08] <%rottingpastry> The only thing I hated about this expansion is all the levitating because it's so fucking easy to accidentally tap A twice and slowly die
[0:40:30] <%honeyman18> So does like nothing exist unless you see it here? or is there a defined infinite world of platforms out there?
[0:40:36] <%rottingpastry> Not allowed
[0:40:45] <%CalderGaming> that's a hitbox issue
[0:40:46] <%Jaxnos> mmmmmm, hitboxes
[0:40:48] <$Dakuu75> LOL it grows back?!
[0:40:58] <+JustToWatch> rocket works better for break crystal
[0:41:01] <KnightAsteran> @honeyman18 I think it comes into existence as you need it kinda deal
[0:41:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> This game is just Gravity Rush without the disorientation and a gun.
[0:41:11] <Clowns> stone plants :O
[0:41:22] <%CalderGaming> so, nothing like gravity rush
[0:41:32] <$RealThiele> disagree
[0:41:35] <%NWR_James> and less waiting in line
[0:41:43] <beerdysonthehunt> this game is like mgs5 but with a different protagonist and different gameplay
[0:41:44] <chambatron> I should play gravity rush
[0:41:44] <%tattleworm> kat also fights extradimensional horror
[0:41:45] <%rottingpastry> I do love how the Nail protects itself
[0:41:51] <penitentpentwitch> The 'Id' like to copy things they see
[0:41:52] <KnightAsteran> doesnt Graviry Rush have sick dropkicks tho?
[0:42:02] <+ALazo> Now I want to play gravity rush 2
[0:42:03] <%cvp5127> not true, you play as garbage in gravity rush
[0:42:09] <$RealThiele> and moves faster overall
[0:42:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> KAT IS NOT GARBAGE
[0:42:36] <+ALazo> She only lives in garbage
[0:42:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> Hobo? Yes
[0:42:39] <%Sendrak70> This game is so good. Really surprised it hasnt gotten more attention.
[0:42:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> Garbage? No
[0:42:57] <$RealThiele> epic game store limited initial hype
[0:43:01] <%cvp5127> @StrawberryPantsu she literally sleeps in garbage LUL
[0:43:05] <yourliteraldog> Its closer to what if the matrix was magic and reality is real but pliable.
[0:43:07] <%rottingpastry> donut let the melee man hurt you
[0:43:10] <+JustToWatch> wait did Pat never get the eternal fire mid?
[0:43:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> I liked this game,but got burnt out on the back end
[0:43:22] <penitentpentwitch> Rock, man's oldest ally
[0:43:22] <%rottingpastry> there's a thing up there
[0:43:23] <+G_Thunders> I forgot how much the pistol changes without the 100% ammo refund upgrade, been taking that for granted I guess
[0:43:24] <KnightAsteran> the control speedrun at GDQ was radical tho
[0:43:28] <+warlockwithapixie> hey
[0:43:31] <alwayspronking> but the dance is cool tho!
[0:43:32] <chambatron> Is this the dlc about alan wake?
[0:43:33] <Goergorion> the Yeet is strong with this one
[0:43:33] <%logoth_> The dance is the best part
[0:43:37] <wibbwobbler> howdareyou
[0:43:37] <beerdysonthehunt> good ol rock
[0:43:39] <$RealThiele> only in shamalama Arrrr bendar
[0:43:42] <%rottingpastry> Yeah.
[0:43:49] <%tattleworm> yeah, that's in the base game, secret quest
[0:43:49] <%rottingpastry> You have to burn TV in the furnace area
[0:43:54] <%rottingpastry> TVs
[0:43:58] <%logoth_> Take THAT you ROCK
[0:44:00] <penitentpentwitch> The longest jump
[0:44:12] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt that's the eternal fire mod, you get it by throwings tv's into the furnace
[0:44:12] <+G_Thunders> In the base game you have to collect all the TV’s around the furnace and burn them, yeah
[0:44:18] <lyzejag> There's a few mods that are busted pour usually they also are hard to get
[0:44:24] <%rottingpastry> dang wrong area
[0:44:24] <KnightAsteran> do it no balls
[0:44:28] <lyzejag> but usually*
[0:44:35] <$RealThiele> rip
[0:44:38] <$Dakuu75> this feels like abad idea
[0:44:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Whaa
[0:44:52] <+CourageTheCat> @PatStaresAt any plans to play the new warframe update?
[0:44:55] <$RealThiele> ok LUL
[0:44:56] <LorcaNomad> nailed it?
[0:45:08] <ZComiX> is this going backwards?
[0:45:16] <+Regigangster> Aw its fun though
[0:45:18] <penitentpentwitch> Eh, it doesn't really move the story forward much. It's fine.
[0:45:19] <yourliteraldog> Oh its the fast bois
[0:45:20] <ZComiX> guess not
[0:45:27] <LorcaNomad> warframe's a bit meh for pat ever since he got inaros
[0:45:29] <Teyaric> Warframe is such a tragedy. They have no idea what kind of game they made.
[0:45:45] <KnightAsteran> the new warframe update does add a new glasses waifu tho
[0:45:57] <$RealThiele> Warframe is a diablo game that went deep into Gacha-style gameplay
[0:45:57] <+Regigangster> LUL then dont use inaros aka easy mode
[0:46:04] <%Agami23> isnt he toddler age?
[0:46:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> And so he shall remain for as long as he lives
[0:46:13] <LorcaNomad> and incest from what I gathered from shy's video
[0:46:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> The dog pout is powerful
[0:46:15] <%suikudo> that gun looks like it does fuck all for damage
[0:46:36] <Teyaric> They don't get that they've made a game that feels like it should be a diablo tho - its all about optimizing and once you're done your done
[0:46:36] <$RealThiele> yea the super powers defeinitely outshine Gun
[0:46:42] <Teyaric> Or you have to go nuts to get perfect mods
[0:46:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> Good evening ORB LORD
[0:46:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> My doggo will pout if I stop playing with her for 1 minute to check my phone.
[0:46:52] <Rosy_Joan> i dont play much warframe anymore but I stay for the lewds
[0:46:53] <yourliteraldog> They should add a mode to warframe that turns into visual novel with Eroge Elements
[0:47:08] <%rottingpastry> congrats you got an elemental source gain mod! uuuugh
[0:47:10] <penitentpentwitch> Grip is the standard pistol parallel. Not big in burst damage, but accurate and plenty of shots in a clip.
[0:47:10] <$Dakuu75> I wanna hear Zangief's Nixon-barks when his jowls get bigger
[0:47:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yourliteraldog I mean fans have already.... anyway Control huh?
[0:47:12] <$RealThiele> oh man, id do a warframe dating sim
[0:47:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> @yourliteraldog Honestly almost every game could use that
[0:47:39] <+Regigangster> @Teyaric Yeah, maybe one day though, or maybe more silly weird side games
[0:47:51] <+zooeymainbtw> hows game so far?
[0:47:53] <penitentpentwitch> The really question of a Warframe Dating Sim, who would the secret character be?
[0:47:54] <yourliteraldog> @CommanderSqueaks Based
[0:47:58] <%rottingpastry> weird crooked pillar
[0:47:59] <$Zalthia> Climbin' the tower
[0:48:01] <%arancet> more yellow
[0:48:03] <KnightAsteran> how would you date tho? the horrific flash beast grineer? or torso heads
[0:48:14] <%honeyman18> When someone slips and falls, do they just consider them dead?
[0:48:25] <Rosy_Joan> @patstaresat do you think this game is worth getting if you dont have a ps4 pro or a gaming rig?
[0:48:34] <%rottingpastry> Jesse just teleports back
[0:48:41] <%BoneofMalkav> Pat fills a hole (Gone Wrong and Right at the same time)
[0:48:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> seeing pat float around makes me miss gravity rush
[0:49:01] <$RealThiele> and wait for that port to go on sale
[0:49:02] <%Deekman> it's fine on Pro
[0:49:03] <wibbwobbler> yuuuup
[0:49:04] <%tinyswampthing> how is this on ps4 pro
[0:49:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> Anyone play that Ctuhlu dating Sim?
[0:49:10] <+ALazo> The framerate dimension can't save you
[0:49:13] <%Piemen99> so what has the story been like for this dlc?
[0:49:14] <Rosy_Joan> understandable, thanks. i was thinking I wouldnt enjoy this at potato graphics
[0:49:22] <%CalderGaming> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ you are not the first person to mention that this stream!
[0:49:27] <+zooeymainbtw> @PatStaresAt whats the minimum you would recommend? Im running a 1070
[0:49:28] <%bread_assassin> Can confirm. Playing it on the base Xbox One, and the game lags everytime I pause than unpause.
[0:49:28] <%Deekman> I'm playing it on Pro it's fine. Not great but very playable
[0:49:30] <chambatron> I got it on ps now but it doens't have the dlc so ill prob get it next gen
[0:49:32] <$RealThiele> oh man Dread X 2 should be paiges next stream with that Cthulu smooching game
[0:49:48] <lyzejag> The game is okay on ps4 fat but it can bother some people
[0:49:48] <LorcaNomad> it's basically a really good game but also a tech demo for higher end consoles and PC tech
[0:49:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RealThiele It has Cthulhu Smooching!?
[0:49:59] <%tinyswampthing> cause my pc meets the recommend on steam not sure if it would be better on pro
[0:50:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> I second this notion of Peach streaming Dread X 2
[0:50:01] <%CalderGaming> @tinyswampthing I play it on PS4 pro. it's decent, though not without some stuttering when loading in or out of menus
[0:50:02] <yourliteraldog> Busty Cthulu
[0:50:03] <$RealThiele> it sure does
[0:50:06] <$Zalthia> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah.
[0:50:17] <%rottingpastry> It's pretty playable on a single 1080 (not TI)
[0:50:18] <KnightAsteran> whens Paige gonna do Monster Prom damnit
[0:50:27] <Rosy_Joan> i for one welcome more SCP inspired titles.
[0:50:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @KnightAsteran Can you date a skeleton in it?
[0:50:38] <+Byronic_dreamer> The only thing that bothers me on ps4 is the stuttering when you unpause
[0:50:47] <arkv01> is this the alan wake dlc?
[0:50:48] <%tinyswampthing> ill try it on pc first and if it runs not great on mine ill refund it and get it on ps4
[0:50:52] <penitentpentwitch> SCP Dating Sim is go
[0:50:58] <%rottingpastry> Control will happen again...in a town called...
[0:50:59] <KnightAsteran> do zombo count?
[0:51:04] <KnightAsteran> or a ghost
[0:51:04] <%CalderGaming> pat still getting blue mods for wome reason
[0:51:04] <%rottingpastry> This is the Foundation
[0:51:08] <%CalderGaming> *some
[0:51:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> No
[0:51:12] <LorcaNomad> rock man friend
[0:51:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let her know when they release the skeleton DLC
[0:51:20] <$RealThiele> in monster prom i know theres a ghost, frankenstein, and werewolf, dunno bout vamps or skeletons
[0:51:27] <waltzqueen> I love how Jesse is the Director and her special abilities allow her to make enemies work for her. it's a good thematic it
[0:51:29] <%CalderGaming> I was not getting many more blues at this point
[0:51:32] <%CalderGaming> on ps4
[0:51:34] <chambatron> Is this the chaos dimension Shuma gorath was talking about
[0:51:34] <%rottingpastry> They scale, they just scale to minimum level 3 and that it lol
[0:51:41] <%tattleworm> they added some cool unique mods in the AWE, especially for shatter
[0:51:42] <$Zalthia> @CommanderSqueaks I think the sequel has a psychopomp
[0:51:48] <waltzqueen> @RealThiele there is a hispter vampire but no skele
[0:51:57] <$RealThiele> darn
[0:52:03] <%honeyman18> Power bombing in is still cool
[0:52:12] <+pectusumbra> @RealThiele there is a vampire hipster in monster prom, also multiple secret characters.
[0:52:16] <$RealThiele> i think hipster vampire and my mind goes back to lego movie 2
[0:52:18] <%rottingpastry> Yeah, the AWE mods are WAAAAAAY better than the Foundation mods
[0:52:20] <penitentpentwitch> The mods system in Control feels like they added it in last minute and did minimal balance testing in many cases.
[0:52:28] <KnightAsteran> I feel like Paige would love the ghost character tho
[0:52:32] <KnightAsteran> she's great
[0:52:37] <%CalderGaming> take more advantage of the fact that your seized bro was stunning him
[0:52:40] <yourliteraldog> All Vampires are hipters goths
[0:52:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> S K E L E T O N
[0:52:43] <$RealThiele> ghost character has huge ectoplasmic titties
[0:52:56] <+Byronic_dreamer> I can't play AWE for a week 'cause my debit card was stolen.I cry.
[0:53:04] <Teyaric> Are these Hiss dudes?
[0:53:05] <%rottingpastry> They're definitely poorly planned. I'm pretty sure they team just threw random ideas out and put them all in.
[0:53:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> f
[0:53:10] <+Byronic_dreamer> I NEED it
[0:53:12] <gyrogrey> there's a threshold kids video at that last control point you cleansed
[0:53:16] <$RealThiele> i think these are the astral dudes
[0:53:17] <%tattleworm> shatter gets a -100% spread mod which you can combine with "chance to regain ammo on hit" to get an infinite ammo magnum
[0:53:27] <yourliteraldog> That stright up looks big boy warhammer 40k chaos unit
[0:53:33] <%rottingpastry> that's a level 6 mod, nice
[0:53:35] <%CalderGaming> @Teyaric yep. the all-dark-gray ones are Id
[0:53:40] <%CalderGaming> I think
[0:53:46] <+aeronauticaljon> Just humped in, any new looking levels compared to yesterday?
[0:53:55] <$Dakuu75> question: WHen the mind control is over, do they turn back into enemies or just die?
[0:53:56] <Teyaric> And whats their storyline deal?
[0:54:01] <%CalderGaming> flesh-tones and/or glowing red are Hiss
[0:54:01] <iamdiosson> You missed an audio log btw
[0:54:03] <+SlashHabit> 500 watching? I feel a retail job coming up.

[0:54:13] <$RealThiele> Story is the foundation needs to be renailed
[0:54:13] <@SoFarFetched> are you sure it wasnt the creak in her back
[0:54:16] <%CalderGaming> @Dakuu75 when seize wears off they die
[0:54:20] <$Zalthia> He usually doesn't stream this early
[0:54:21] <%rottingpastry> They came out in the patch that added challenge missions

[0:59:31] <arkv01> gief needta mark his territory
[0:59:33] <yourliteraldog> its a noodle
[0:59:34] <KnightAsteran> I keep imagining that Former is just shoveling out swears whenever those random symbols appear in his dialogue
[0:59:37] <$RealThiele> Former needs the lordvessel
[0:59:44] <waltzqueen> hiii......buddy
[0:59:51] <Pookiedaexzile> "Teh Suck" is what that thing just said

[1:00:16] <+ALazo> What is this conversation
[1:00:17] <%Wallabri> panini........
[1:00:19] <yourliteraldog> He is ordering lunch pat
[1:00:20] <LorcaNomad> PANINI IS GOOD
[1:00:22] <waltzqueen> PANNINI
[1:00:22] <$RealThiele> panini press was taken by the board
[1:00:23] <chambatron> Panini Board
[1:00:23] <lyzejag> What the fuck are they saying
[1:00:25] <avidneptune> Former was fucking with the fridge
[1:00:26] <%EdHeng> EdHeng subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 2 years + 1 <3
[1:00:33] <PulverKong> he's just ordering some paninis
[1:00:37] <penitentpentwitch> Don't you hate it when Eldritch Abominations try to speak in metaphors and the translator just gives up
[1:00:45] <%LegendGHT> what the hell is this thing
[1:00:48] <%rottingpastry> Awkward first date
[1:00:59] <%rottingpastry> It's Former.
[1:01:00] <%honeyman18> Thanks for the HyperReveal @edheng
[1:01:08] <arkv01> good words, ok see you next sunday!
[1:01:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think the Former doesn't like the Nail.
[1:01:08] <%rottingpastry> It might be an ex board member...????
[1:01:09] <LorcaNomad> BURN THE LEECH
[1:01:14] <lyzejag> I'd trust the former
[1:01:16] <%king_wragles> Some kind of parasite infected the board maybe?
[1:01:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> Chatting with your uber driver be like
[1:01:19] <yourliteraldog> He seems cool he is ordering some sandos
[1:01:22] <+pectusumbra> Something leeching off the house, it'd seem?
[1:01:23] <waltzqueen> The nail is a leech on the house? It's killing the house?!
[1:01:24] <chambatron> Can you stand on the spikes and activate them @PatStaresAt
[1:01:24] <%Totally_Not_Toby> i like the former he seems like a nice guy
[1:01:28] <$RealThiele> board is a leech, burn them and the nail for science
[1:01:29] <%LegendGHT> where's the Latter
[1:01:29] <%CalderGaming> (you're back where you were before you touched that 2nd Tree tablet)
[1:01:30] <ZComiX> Ok Chaos Insugency
[1:01:32] <%astrophizz> Darmak and Jalad at Tanagra
[1:01:34] <KnightAsteran> like I keep thinking hes just saying "house fuckin listen bitch board crap" etc
[1:01:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Former-chan seems legit
[1:01:39] <%Ipsenscastle> Is the janitor the leech? he seemed benevolent
[1:01:41] <%honeyman18> I mean if she has polaris, does she need the board?
[1:01:42] <penitentpentwitch> I'd laugh if there's a Panini on her desk next time you visited
[1:01:43] <%Wallabri> me too, former
[1:01:43] <yourliteraldog> Everyone has to eat pat
[1:01:51] <%Aeoneth> I love how she just goes, Yes or No > Question. And it takes him a while to process/try to find a way to be cryptic before answering
[1:01:51] <+ALazo> The thing swears every other word you can't trust it
[1:01:56] <%rottingpastry> Ahti is a mystery
[1:01:56] <Teyaric> And now, she IS Polaris
[1:01:58] <%torusendor> Former really needs to enunciate.
[1:02:00] <%LegendGHT> I think you mean everyone has to eat, pat
[1:02:00] <$Zalthia> Id like a panini
[1:02:03] <LorcaNomad> i'd trust the former a lot more than the board cuz the board kinda throws out the director whenever for the new one
[1:02:06] <%astrophizz> Shaka. when the walls fell
[1:02:07] <%rottingpastry> But he is named after a Finnish god of water
[1:02:11] <%arancet> should i be worried that an eldritch extradimensional...thing even knows what a panini is?
[1:02:16] <%rottingpastry> Like a janitor would be
[1:02:17] <%CalderGaming> @honeyman18 polaris doesn't solve everything, unfortunately
[1:02:19] <yourliteraldog> At least isnt hungry for souls or babies
[1:02:22] <%Ipsenscastle> what was the significance of abalone?
[1:02:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Aeoneth That's Jesse's true power, learning how to cut through Eldritch bullshit speak
[1:02:41] <%CalderGaming> @Ipsenscastle as far as I know? comic relief
[1:02:44] <$RealThiele> Abalone is typically harvested for mother of pearl
[1:02:45] <ZComiX> gotta be a reason marshall and house hid this place nad why former wants to stop the nail from being complete
[1:02:56] <$Zalthia> @lorcanomad I mean. To be fair the previous directors caught fire, and killed himself, respectively
[1:02:57] <wibbwobbler> nice
[1:03:04] <penitentpentwitch> @arancet Nope! That shows it at least has some care for culture. Or the universal translator is shorting and its trying its best.
[1:03:07] <yourliteraldog> Wasn't there OOP that was like tuna fish
[1:03:19] <$Zalthia> One caught fire, the other killed himself, I mean.
[1:03:22] <%rottingpastry> look at the big brain on pat
[1:03:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Zalthia The former director is STILL on fire, and might be forever.
[1:03:44] <yourliteraldog> One is powering the building by being on fire
[1:03:45] <%rottingpastry> Oh, the guy in the containment chamber
[1:03:49] <%ShogunNoonto> ShogunNoonto subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 3 month streak! hello pat

[1:04:00] <$Dakuu75> it's the floor below you?
[1:04:02] <penitentpentwitch> Area isn't fully explored yet
[1:04:04] <%MelBrooksKA> It's really hard to not read OOP as Object Oriented Programming
[1:04:06] <%DedlokPM> because lower elevation?
[1:04:07] <ZComiX> Dark blue* lower area
[1:04:08] <%Ipsenscastle> @RealThiele oh does the former form the stone stuff? and the board were harvesting it?
[1:04:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Northmoore got it so fucking rough, but honestly the more we learn about him the more I start feeling he might have deserved it.
[1:04:14] <penitentpentwitch> You couldn't explore it without your new power
[1:04:15] <yourliteraldog> upsys
[1:04:22] <yourliteraldog> CHASM!
[1:04:23] <wibbwobbler> different elevation?
[1:04:29] <arkv01> yeah I'd like it if it was ooPs instead
[1:04:31] <LorcaNomad> up we go oh boy
[1:04:31] <JorgenTheElf> What's all this then?
[1:04:33] <waltzqueen> Northmoor earned the type of Not-Death he got
[1:04:38] <%astrophizz> TV escort
[1:04:40] <lyzejag> Depends on the elevation maybe ? If it's darker it may have multiple floors

[1:08:02] <%rottingpastry> They will murder you.
[1:08:23] <yourliteraldog> Things that games still havent figured out 1. Sound Mixing. 2 Brightness
[1:08:33] <%honeyman18> The light Helps?
[1:08:37] <LorcaNomad> is that just ahti on the tv?
[1:08:46] <+Estuko> monkaS

[1:09:43] <waltzqueen> HEWWO
[1:09:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> TV-fren
[1:09:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> This light and dark thing is reminding me of Alan Wake
[1:10:04] <LorcaNomad> why is there equipment all the way down here
[1:10:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> These stone things are the id, right?
[1:10:09] <%rottingpastry> They're easy to kill, but I'm pretty sure you just die if they hit you
[1:10:11] <penitentpentwitch> I do like that the white light pings over their head whenever they're stunned by the TV
[1:10:14] <+Estuko> monkaS
[1:10:16] <%Typhaeon> Is the image on the TV Alan?
[1:10:22] <+ALazo> This is not a tv, it's a companion cube.
[1:10:31] <%UltimortalMoth> Hope all of you are doing well too.
[1:10:33] <%Madbearv> why is the viewer count so low

[1:11:27] <+MinovskyPhysics> Yes, still Foundation.
[1:11:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Even when Ahti on vacation, he's helping his assistant. Good guy Ahti
[1:11:28] <LorcaNomad> wait that was alan on the tv
[1:11:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Weird this TV is playing the serbian film on repeat non stop, what's up with that
[1:11:37] <%Sendrak70> so why dont they attack you if you hold the tv?
[1:11:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> I found out home depot sells 12 ft skeleton. Neat
[1:12:00] <wibbwobbler> not sure that's how a t.v works
[1:12:06] <%rottingpastry> Ahti is very relaxing
[1:12:12] <%Typhaeon> It's a metaphor for how TV fries your brain, maaaaan
[1:12:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's literally how TV works.
[1:12:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ahti ASMR

[1:13:23] <yourliteraldog> Zombies are a marxist allegory for consumerism
[1:13:42] <JorgenTheElf> Zambamboozles
[1:13:52] <%Typhaeon> Zombies are an authoritarian allegory for "everyone not in the ruling party"
[1:13:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Five dollars Ahti is going to start talking to Jesse.

[1:14:58] <%rottingpastry> A-001 aka Ahti
[1:15:02] <+WutangchickeN> He's like twice as big as he was 3 weeks ago.
[1:15:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> If everyone is a video game person, is live action the equivalent of V Tubing?
[1:15:06] <arkv01> I want gief to pee on me too...
[1:15:08] <PanicSwytch> Zangief destroyed elmo in their battle to the death
[1:15:14] <penitentpentwitch> Bonus point the blotted out entry is short enough to be "Ahti"
[1:15:17] <+G_Thunders> I love that Ahti is 001
[1:15:19] <+HeyReynard> Oh, so it's MST3000.
[1:15:40] <%rottingpastry> TAKE CONTROL!
[1:15:42] <+aeronauticaljon> You don't keep the harness on him all day right?
[1:15:48] <%Typhaeon> How about the telvision itself that can survive being thrown into rock walls at 30 MPH
[1:15:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ahti is LITERALLY an influencer.
[1:16:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat did Math!
[1:16:14] <%RyTYoung> Say what now

[1:16:34] <+P00kie89> That's 0.8 tens
[1:16:36] <+aeronauticaljon> If you keep a harness on the dog all day, it could lead to rashes

[1:16:59] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:16:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> See, the problem with Do Combo is that it involves mathing a lot of little numbers, while Big Number just means mathing one or two numbers, which is clearly superior.
[1:17:04] <iamdiosson> Anti makes the kids watch tv
[1:17:10] <arkv01> mmmm yes pet the baby
[1:17:10] <%Sendrak70> puppy chews are the best though!
[1:17:11] <%Supermonaman> That's how math works yes.
[1:17:15] <%Ipsenscastle> choosen?
[1:17:24] <penitentpentwitch> Zangief, King of Big Numbers
[1:17:31] <%Typhaeon> But you can't get Big Number without Do Combo of many little 1s
[1:17:37] <JorgenTheElf> He's got the nibblies
[1:17:53] <%mike2hands> Hello everybody i almost forgot today was friday
[1:17:54] <%rottingpastry> Is Tommasi in this dlc?
[1:18:02] <%rottingpastry> Oh yeah, never mind
[1:18:14] <%CalderGaming> yeah I was about to say
[1:18:22] <PanicSwytch> When's the next ppv fight between Zangief and Elmo?
[1:18:35] <avidneptune> Look at the cave painting
[1:18:40] <%rottingpastry> Oh the warehouse is a blast
[1:18:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> As an owner of a stouter, clumsy canine, be weary of getting your legs clipped out from under you from charging doggo when Z gets bigger. It is a legitimate fear.
[1:19:01] <Ashenik1> How old is Elmo?
[1:19:02] <TheDewdHole> Heya Pat!
[1:19:13] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks I know this fear, everyday.
[1:19:17] <%rottingpastry> uh...
[1:19:29] <%cowardman93> the fear of doggo trip is too real
[1:19:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RyTYoung A strong dog with an agility dump stat is truly terrifying.
[1:19:51] <penitentpentwitch> Oh no... I just realized... Zangief is the Z-target
[1:19:52] <%rottingpastry> control points are for babies
[1:20:23] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks The thing is my doggos agility stat is shit, but his poise is soo strong so no matter what speed he runs into me, I go down LUL
[1:20:28] <%Razputin217> Yggdrasil
[1:20:41] <%Deekman> RED....TREEEEE
[1:21:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RyTYoung My dog is a pit mix. Thankfully she can't get good traction on the hardwood floors. If I had carpet I'd be screwed.

Clarification on my story from the other day, the reason why that owl shat on my leg was because I was taking a photo with in (this was in a zoo), and it turned out the owl was half-asleep

[1:23:01] <yourliteraldog> I kinda wanna try it
[1:23:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RyTYoung Living in the city means she mainly walks on concrete, which also helps keep her claws short, too. I only have to really trim her dew claws.
[1:23:08] <%RyTYoung> Paige is feeding you the mold in your sleep, isn't she @patstaresat ?
[1:23:14] <+ALazo> ew

[1:23:27] <+aeronauticaljon> are you serious you could't fit through that hole?
[1:23:31] <%Neryl_> God dammit, I'd forgotten about the mold. Why?
[1:23:36] <%NWR_James> Paige is mould experimenting
[1:23:36] <avidneptune> You missed a readable in the yellow building
[1:23:43] <thetruthofyourbeing> is that Paige the mold eater talking?
[1:23:46] <yourliteraldog> Is it like ergot fungus? We could start making Magic LSD

[1:24:23] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks Yeah my dogs dew claws get caught in his ear hair when he's scratching them sometimes, not ideal at all (he's a Springer spaniel so he's got huge ears haha)
[1:24:27] <%rottingpastry> Northmoor insists on the name because the board told him so
[1:24:33] <lyzejag> Ash had a rough time in the FBC
[1:24:46] <PanicSwytch> Dragon roads?!

[1:26:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> We solved the patriarchy back in the 1960's, good job world.
[1:26:50] <yourliteraldog> Back in 1964
[1:26:51] <Pookiedaexzile> It all ties together people

[1:27:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> I yearn for the day that I see someone use Sheeple unironically, again.
[1:27:29] <waltzqueen> how complicated are we talking?

[1:28:17] <yourliteraldog> Hewwo
[1:28:33] <LorcaNomad> never seen dead batteries in this game before
[1:28:36] <%CalderGaming> ah okay I found one of the beckoning cats in here
[1:28:43] <avidneptune> Readable
[1:28:44] <yourliteraldog> Jessie needs cat ears
[1:28:59] <%CalderGaming> by here i mean the dlc, not the warehouse specifically
[1:29:03] <%honeyman18> Note by the generator in power ore level
[1:29:13] <%rottingpastry> What sucks is you have to go to the astral plane to put them on and take them off.
[1:29:26] <%rottingpastry> I forgot I had them, so when I started the game for AWE, I was like. Ohhhhhh yeah
[1:29:27] <%CalderGaming> boo
[1:29:30] <%astrophizz> it connects back
[1:29:34] <waltzqueen> bewcome a cat girl in your soul to do it in your body
[1:29:37] <penitentpentwitch> Elevator is basically a checkpoint system, you'll be back later
[1:29:40] <%Neryl_> Just use the door moon2S
[1:29:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, did anyone see that post about how the PS3 is as old now as the NES was when the PS3 came out and did they die inside?
[1:30:00] <Ashenik1> @PatStaresAt Have you ever played Thronbreaker the witcher tales? If not would you consider playing it on stream in the future?
[1:30:12] <%critiquequartz> psaDogchamp
[1:30:21] <LorcaNomad> thanks pat
[1:30:27] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks I died when I saw Macaulay Culkien post he was 40.
[1:30:45] <%rottingpastry> The PS3 isn't 21 years old?
[1:30:49] <+reemasbaid> game volume low?
[1:30:56] <+reemasbaid> i just hopped in idk
[1:31:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ash sounds like he was done with this shit since the day he was born.
[1:31:04] <DSD24> Remember the PS3 boomerang controller?
[1:31:10] <+reemasbaid> did I miss alan wake yet
[1:31:16] <%rottingpastry> It's in game audio, so it's probably blocked by something
[1:31:21] <%RyTYoung> @reemasbaid not yet
[1:31:21] <DSD24> Triangles have 3 points
[1:31:21] <+reemasbaid> it's not a lake IT'S AN OCEAN
[1:31:22] <%rottingpastry> Nope, still the foundation
[1:31:26] <yourliteraldog> Ahh YEAH OCCULTISM
[1:31:33] <StebTheVee> which DLC is this?
[1:31:41] <wibbwobbler> it's still foundation
[1:31:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @StebTheVee Foundation
[1:31:54] <+reemasbaid> even better meheheheh
[1:31:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's not an ocean, it's a cave apparently
[1:32:04] <StebTheVee> ok
[1:32:06] <%SirGO0SE> rooHi rooHi sup Pat sup Chat how we liking it so far
[1:32:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> We in AWE yet?
[1:32:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh no not the rocks
[1:32:18] <waltzqueen> really good, goose
[1:32:20] <+reemasbaid> i got very close to finishing this game and left my copy with a friend so they could play this trippy game high
[1:32:23] <Djinnazz> no
[1:32:23] <%rottingpastry> stuff!
[1:32:33] <%SirGO0SE> @waltzqueen psaUp psaUp
[1:32:42] <%rottingpastry> That better
[1:32:46] <+reemasbaid> i dont regret not finishing it c i kow how awesome of a game it was, but the only story i really am into is the awe connection
[1:33:05] <%Hasmeister96> everyone
[1:33:06] <+Estuko> Just finished my cereal, now I'm thinking back to that cereal milk convo. Best flavor?
[1:33:10] <%rottingpastry> Whaaat no this isn't a combat arena...ok I lied
[1:33:28] <penitentpentwitch> Needs more waist high walls
[1:33:28] <%CalderGaming> CLONK
[1:33:33] <$KnivesEve> nice
[1:33:52] <yourliteraldog> pat has a shield ablity
[1:34:01] <%rottingpastry> It's not a cover shooter thankfully
[1:34:02] <yourliteraldog> but rarely uses it
[1:34:21] <%Hasmeister96> Any of you guys know when Woolie is going to upload the next episode of Ghost of Tsushima?
[1:34:21] <penitentpentwitch> Another reason I like Peirce, those guys
[1:34:38] <%rottingpastry> I forget about shield all the time.
[1:35:09] <%DensityD> not on my watch
[1:35:19] <%Hasmeister96> Wait this is a warehouse?
[1:35:20] <penitentpentwitch> Shield is weirdly situational until you can counterlaunch
[1:35:23] <%rottingpastry> It's kind of like the nail. hmmmmmm
[1:35:26] <yourliteraldog> It turns into to a weapon when you level it up
[1:35:34] <%rottingpastry> the tower is
[1:35:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> Does Pat have an Orb Meter
[1:35:40] <avidneptune> There’s secret rooms in the tower
[1:35:46] <yourliteraldog> shield rush
[1:35:52] <yourliteraldog> its good
[1:35:55] <+reemasbaid> jeez this is massive
[1:36:05] <%rottingpastry> The tower holds many secrets
[1:36:24] <%honeyman18> Mostly for you're running and zapping around bullshit
[1:36:56] <yourliteraldog> noice
[1:37:09] <yourliteraldog> ice spike!
[1:38:07] <yourliteraldog> Oh the hiss is still a problem?
[1:38:08] <%rottingpastry> Fences are impervious to your bullets
[1:38:33] <%rottingpastry> It seems to be coming from inside the elevator
[1:38:38] <waltzqueen> @yourliteraldog it never stopped being a problem, it just stopped Getting Worse
[1:38:54] <%Dwarven_Gaming> send the elvator down?
[1:38:55] <+reemasbaid> I love noticing the gameplay mechanics brought into alan wake being massively improved in this game
[1:38:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> If Jessie is Paige then The Hiss must represent the urge to consume Mold trying to overtake her
[1:39:01] <%rottingpastry> big brain
[1:39:05] <%Neryl_> You can't penetrate its de fences. psaDab
[1:39:25] <Djinnazz> secret by elevator
[1:39:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> DA FUQ WAS THAT?
[1:39:55] <yourliteraldog> @Neryl_ CARLOS!

[1:40:23] <%Nupinoop296> so what is going on exactly? i missed the start of the stream

[1:40:37] <$Zalthia> Man, now I REALLY want a panini
[1:40:45] <cipher758> orb is where Pat stores his power

[1:40:46] <%rottingpastry> Now that you have them, you may have them
[1:40:51] <%Hasmeister96> isn't the former dead?
[1:40:51] <Dwarven_Gaming> WOW
[1:40:54] <%Nupinoop296> UWU

[1:41:47] <%DensityD> synergy LUL
[1:41:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> So wait are we repairing the board?

[1:42:00] <huskarl_zap> MANDALORE REVIEW OUT NOW PogChamp
[1:42:05] <penitentpentwitch> We're just used to Calamari
[1:42:05] <%CalderGaming> expert on eldritch morphology, eh?
[1:42:11] <LorcaNomad> was gone a few minutes, wha happun?
[1:42:16] <KnightAsteran> mathematical perfect objects are also eldritch AF
[1:42:21] <DominoAxiom> My disembodied esoteric metaphor for bureaucratic hierarchy can’t possibly be this cute
[1:42:24] <%rottingpastry> Fixing the nail.
[1:42:25] <%Dwarven_Gaming> WELL that could have ended badly
[1:42:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> Me? :)
[1:42:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:42:33] <%CalderGaming> GENIUS
[1:42:34] <%rottingpastry> It keeps the astral plane out of reality
[1:42:34] <%reonome> WASTED
[1:42:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:42:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LorcaNomad The Board said it was sowwy it got mad at us for getting the other power from The Former.

[1:42:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> PROFESSIONAL STREAMER GUYS
[1:42:55] <%rottingpastry> Can float. Forgets to. Best director ever
[1:42:56] <penitentpentwitch> Swift Platform! That was the name of the sidequest!
[1:43:02] <%Dwarven_Gaming> that was LACK of trying
[1:43:04] <cipher758> oh shit he won!
[1:43:12] <fuji_92> if on
[1:43:17] <%rottingpastry> Also you missed a control point next to the warehouse
[1:43:19] <%CalderGaming> @penitentpentwitch that was so frustrating
[1:43:20] <%SirGO0SE> this one weird trick, doctors HATE it
[1:43:33] <avidneptune> Everyone knows if you pull out your parachute 1m before the ground you’ll be fine
[1:43:54] <%rottingpastry> shhhh we don't talk about the platform
[1:44:05] <%CalderGaming> all swift platform needed was ONE checkpoint in the middle
[1:44:06] <penitentpentwitch> @CalderGaming I liked the production value of it, but it certainly had the 'platformer problem'
[1:44:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh that doesn't look good
[1:44:26] <+Javaa01> You break that one by crushing it with the elevator
[1:44:38] <penitentpentwitch> There are some holes lower you can fall to on the side
[1:44:44] <penitentpentwitch> Well, float
[1:44:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> Just git gud Pat
[1:45:17] <LorcaNomad> nailed it

[1:48:54] <LorcaNomad> was that literally nothing oh my god
[1:48:59] <%tattleworm> there's usually a power core behind there but you didn't need it because you got one from elsewhere

[1:50:01] <JustPlainEdgy> @BallerSwagBro9k mostly jsut watch vods and stuff

[1:50:14] <%rottingpastry> look for gaping hole
[1:50:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, does Pat need to go there or is this just Goblins?
[1:50:29] <%CalderGaming> Talk To Pope

[1:50:38] <+Javaa01> It was right in front of you
[1:50:41] <penitentpentwitch> It is
[1:50:43] <%rottingpastry> blind lol
[1:50:52] <+SimplesRock> I feel like this game came out with all the pomp of "Remember Me". BUT once I heard about it, it piqued my interest...
[1:50:56] <MrPedrovsky> BIG BLIND
[1:50:58] <whirly25> this bitch floatin

[1:51:08] <penitentpentwitch> On the bright side, the elevator can take you right back up
[1:51:15] <+Estuko> @SimplesRock it took me to watching and seeing what's in it to gain my real interest
[1:51:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Who designed this place to be like this, and why
[1:51:36] <MrPedrovsky> No Pat you just Big Blinded
[1:51:41] <%rottingpastry> You don't start falling faster if you just keep floating
[1:51:45] <%rottingpastry> Just fyi
[1:51:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> You should constantly patch up Shelmo until he's just a patchwork monstrosity.
[1:51:55] <+Javaa01> Very big blinded
[1:51:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> YOU ARE THO

[1:52:50] <%a_goth_pancake> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipHonk sipsipSipsipblind
[1:52:51] <+SimplesRock> @Estuko totally, this seems like one of those games where an LP would make me more interested in buying it, rather than less. did you end up getting and playing it yourself or still considering?
[1:52:53] <penitentpentwitch> Goblins sated! ...for now
[1:53:17] <+Estuko> @SimplesRock I WANT to get it, I just am in the middle of trying to find another job after being let go
[1:53:22] <%rottingpastry> This game is fantastic
[1:53:39] <%honeyman18> Color out of Space?
[1:53:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wonder what game David Cage is working on RN
[1:53:45] <%rottingpastry> So I don't think this is even the room...
[1:53:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @honeyman18 More or less.
[1:53:51] <cokenegg> why did I change my twitch font to comic sans
[1:54:08] <%BoneofMalkav> LUL
[1:54:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> For Memes?
[1:54:11] <+SimplesRock> @Estuko good luck on the job search, times are tough. The game will hopefully drop in price soon too!
[1:54:12] <%DensityD> something something is my passion
[1:54:14] <amonimis> !uptime
[1:54:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 54m.
[1:54:16] <+Javaa01> Uhh, you gonna activate that elevator floor?
[1:54:17] <Goergorion> *visible disgust*
[1:54:20] <%maenos2> why is that even an option
[1:54:22] <%Typhaeon> Are you roleplaying as a Space Station 13 clown constnatly
[1:54:23] <%Ascethetic> i didnt knopw you could change it tbh
[1:54:32] <ZComiX> I mean Comic sans is easier for people with certain reading impairments to read
[1:54:34] <cokenegg> to be honest it was funny for about 10 minutes or so
[1:54:47] <cokenegg> might be a BTTV feature
[1:54:49] <%Typhaeon> I'm sure several fonts that don't look like garbage are too
[1:54:52] <+Javaa01> There's just a door around the back
[1:54:55] <%rottingpastry> I suggest doing some side questerinos
[1:55:01] <%SirGO0SE> ah, getting to the bottom part
[1:55:15] <%SirGO0SE> buy them a drink first, take them out to dinner, then ask nicely
[1:55:22] <+Javaa01> Oh right, you need the key from Emily for this
[1:55:30] <penitentpentwitch> Doesn't that require a sidequest to go to?
[1:55:32] <+Javaa01> She tells you to go down there for the side quest
[1:55:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god Pat
[1:55:42] <%rottingpastry> please get the control point my brain
[1:55:43] <%rottingpastry> lol
[1:55:46] <iamdiosson> Go talk to pope
[1:56:07] <penitentpentwitch> Teleporting to The Pote
[1:56:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's almost as if that Quest message in the upper left hand side of the screen for the last 20 minutes is important
[1:56:09] <penitentpentwitch> *Pope
[1:56:11] <%hzealot> hzealot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! wow 5 months even tho I've watched on yt since machinima. now to work in fun covid times. disregard elmo pet zangief
[1:56:11] <%rottingpastry> There's one right by the warehouse lol
[1:56:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> HE DO MISS
[1:56:18] <cokenegg> Kappa
[1:56:20] <%SirGO0SE> Pat of many eyes
[1:56:31] <MrPedrovsky> YOU DID MISS ONE THOUGH
[1:56:50] <cokenegg> "so attentive" he says, while looking at a different monitor
[1:56:52] <penitentpentwitch> Technically the basement is somewhere different
[1:56:52] <%rottingpastry> You know what happens when we assume
[1:57:08] <%Typhaeon> They all have Young Daniel Radcliffe mouth syndrome
[1:57:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> I cant look at those facial animations without dying of laughter
[1:57:11] <penitentpentwitch> Most of the mainline for the Warehouse focuses on ascending
[1:57:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how Pope is constantly hyped about this weird shit.
[1:57:20] <%SirGO0SE> pope is mocapped so well
[1:57:25] <cokenegg> wait why does the redhead look so much like a real human
[1:57:28] <StebTheVee> she's just teeth
[1:57:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pope Best Girl
[1:57:36] <+LordSDB> man look at that money for the faces
[1:57:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Awwwww, protec Pope
[1:57:50] <silverira> look at these nerds
[1:57:56] <%honeyman18> Gold starter pack
[1:57:57] <+SimplesRock> oh these faces feel like Horizon. or maybe just very mocapped?
[1:57:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> Reminds me of ME Andromeda NotLikeThis
[1:57:58] <ZComiX> popes a good girl
[1:58:03] <+SimplesRock> BG mouths
[1:58:06] <+SimplesRock> *BIG
[1:58:11] <amonimis> why does Jesse look so annoyed lol
[1:58:13] <%CalderGaming> that's IT?
[1:58:19] <%Typhaeon> The opposite problem from Andromeda, their faces aren't tired enough
[1:58:24] <+Estuko> PogChamp super secret
[1:58:24] <%SirGO0SE> bazinga
[1:58:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL I CANT LUL
[1:58:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @amonimis Wouldn't you be needing to deal with this?
[1:58:27] <%rottingpastry> Bingo bango bongo
[1:58:27] <penitentpentwitch> Something about the mouth skews feels like they've all had strokes
[1:58:30] <+ALazo> badabimbadaboom
[1:58:31] <ZComiX> god fuck poor Darling...
[1:58:33] <StebTheVee> I'm not gonna risk my life going around the place for 5 bucks
[1:58:34] <cokenegg> it reminds me of L.A. Noire except not at all
[1:58:37] <%Rafferty3231> what is WRONG with their FACES
[1:58:42] <fiabobia> her mouth is so weird
[1:58:44] <+SimplesRock> @Typhaeon they are SO VERY AWAKE. eyes and mouths are WIDE open
[1:58:46] <PanicSwytch> They need to fix her mouth
[1:58:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> There's something about their facial expressions that creeps me out, it seems very artificial for some reason
[1:58:47] <amonimis> @commandersqueaks I mean, fair enough lol
[1:58:48] <%CalderGaming> Darling's probably having a great time wherever he is tbh
[1:58:50] <+Take_2_shots> When they talk the mo cap seems to be a bit too Open wide.
[1:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ZComiX I'm pretty sure Darling ascended to a higher plane of existence.
[1:58:58] <+LordSDB> Too much money is the problem
[1:58:59] <+Javaa01> One of the cards is in the basement I think, rest are in and around that warehouse tower
[1:59:05] <Escherite> she's got a huge manjaw and underbite
[1:59:07] <+ALazo> She is trying really hard to keep smiling okay
[1:59:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Reizie_Etherealm Yeah theyre not great
[1:59:13] <%rottingpastry> There's another one
[1:59:14] <cokenegg> is this a triple a game?
[1:59:19] <ZComiX> didnt he basically get trapped in the phantom zone tho?
[1:59:20] <%BoneofMalkav> Yeah Jesee's bottom lip was extremely stiff.
[1:59:32] <%BoneofMalkav> or at least half of her bottom lip
[1:59:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> @cokenegg 2.5 A
[1:59:37] <MrPedrovsky> ON THE TIP TOP PAT
[1:59:40] <%SirGO0SE> but i thought you were the best at seeing?!
[1:59:41] <%Typhaeon> @SimplesRock STAYWOKE mind virus. Some Bureau spook took the phrase too seriously
[1:59:43] <%Razputin217> Darling just jammin’ out to Dynamite all day
[1:59:43] <MrPedrovsky> DIG UP STUPID
[1:59:47] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat would you play PSO2 or is that not your thing?
[1:59:48] <Djinnazz> no Pat...
[1:59:48] <PanicSwytch> Blind
[1:59:52] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt did you do your beast tribe dailies today?
[1:59:52] <%rottingpastry> Pretty sure it's right by the entrance?
[1:59:54] <StebTheVee> The employees have been in the building for days. I would want to go home and quit the job.
[2:00:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:00:03] <penitentpentwitch> On the bright side, ID card get
[2:00:08] <$RealThiele> isnt PSO2 a hot mess in NA atm?
[2:00:08] <PanicSwytch> Tip Top
[2:00:11] <%CalderGaming> readying my One Guy...
[2:00:15] <avidneptune> It’s right by where you first entered
[2:00:21] <%LegendGHT> man this game is a lot more repetitive than I remember it being
[2:00:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is just pretending to be dumb Kappa
[2:00:41] <%rottingpastry> Team kill
[2:00:41] <%Typhaeon> PSO2's on steam but their RMT systems felt really exploitative
[2:00:48] <ZComiX> i think ppl are ok with PSO now actually. i need to look up the news but people are playing
[2:00:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LegendGHT I think it's also cause Pat is trying to 100% every area the first time he's going through it.
[2:00:54] <%CalderGaming> @LegendGHT you may not have backtracked to this area as much as pat has
[2:00:55] <%rottingpastry> What a professional level troll
[2:01:02] <amonimis> first time seeing gameplay for this, and I'm confused as to how that gun works tbh
[2:01:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat pls
[2:01:14] <+sssoapy> Must have
[2:01:18] <%rottingpastry> Insane even
[2:01:18] <$RealThiele> the gun is like the gun in 5th element
[2:01:20] <ivanmistwalker> Kappa
[2:01:22] <%arcielardor> @realthiele it was when it was on the Microsoft store but works pretty good on Steam.
[2:01:25] <%CalderGaming> THE TIP TOP
[2:01:27] <%LegendGHT> I mean just the gameplay in general. I think it's more boring to watch than it is to play though
[2:01:27] <%rottingpastry> perhaps roofs hold secrets
[2:01:28] <+Varadox> The gun Just Works :tm:
[2:01:29] <%Laecerelius> Woooooow
[2:01:33] <avidneptune> This dlc is more repetitive than the main game as most are
[2:01:40] <+Varadox> Why the fuck do I have Prime Gaming.
[2:01:43] <$RealThiele> @arcielardor good to know ty
[2:01:44] <misterspotswood> just joined the stream, is the game fun?
[2:01:44] <DominoAxiom> Free single control point DLC
[2:01:47] <%Typhaeon> Disappointed
[2:01:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LegendGHT I've always gotten that sensation from Remedy games in general.
[2:01:55] <%Dwarven_Gaming> Patstaresatinvisiblecontrolpoint
[2:02:03] <$RealThiele> this game is fun if you enjoy scp and alan wake
[2:02:07] <+Take_2_shots> Shooting your gun is never a solution to a problem
[2:02:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh look at that
[2:02:09] <%rottingpastry> Remedy has the best DLC. Control points, jukeboxes
[2:02:12] <%BoneofMalkav> In Wasteland 3 there's a skill book that's titled "It Just Works" LUL
[2:02:12] <+Take_2_shots> unless it is
[2:02:17] <AFlyingTaco1> So is this game good? I've been hanging on picking it up for a while.
[2:02:18] <%LegendGHT> @CommanderSqueaks yeah that's why I never finished Alan Wake honestly. and I returned this as soon as I finished it
[2:02:35] <+SimplesRock> @misterspotswood we are all on an adventure to find out! current answer is... Maybe?
[2:02:36] <+Varadox> The game is good and fun
[2:02:49] <misterspotswood> @SimplesRock hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:02:55] <$RealThiele> this game also had a rough start because of the epic store
[2:02:57] <+Varadox> The only thing I could knock is the gratuitous amounts of the smoke particles the enemies give off when they die.
[2:02:57] <+G_Thunders> @aflyingtaco1 Yeah, and it’s like $30 or so on steam right now for the complete edition
[2:03:00] <misterspotswood> @Varadox HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[2:03:02] <+Take_2_shots> the lack of [REDACTED] is a bit disoriented in this new papers
[2:03:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get fucked Ash
[2:03:09] <+Varadox> Because I can't see shit when I kill like 10 enemies.
[2:03:19] <penitentpentwitch> Well, forklifts work down here. So possibly Helicopters could
[2:03:20] <avidneptune> The main game is great, the first dlc is also good but less great
[2:03:29] <ZComiX> wouldn't it haven been cheaper to just hood up a camera to a balloon or something?
[2:03:30] <misterspotswood> @PatStaresAt yo is the game fun?
[2:03:30] <penitentpentwitch> Need all five cards to visit basement
[2:03:32] <%LegendGHT> I feel like the writing in Foundation isn't great
[2:03:38] <%DensityD> back in the lab again
[2:03:42] <%rottingpastry> get on the buildings and pull the crystals out?
[2:03:46] <%LegendGHT> I kind of only care about seeing AWE and what it actually is
[2:03:46] <%DensityD> heat the card, cool the cad
[2:03:48] <%honeyman18> Summon Exxodia first
[2:03:49] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> I gotta say pat, your decision to eliminate all exoskeletons disappoints me. My delicious charcuterie plates are nothing without honey! Cheer1000
[2:03:51] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz's Cheer shared rewards to 25 others in Chat! 
[2:03:55] <+Javaa01> Gotta keep going up then
[2:03:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Uh oh back to the lab again
[2:04:04] <ZComiX> @LegendGHT Naw the writing in this game is GREAT
[2:04:07] <$RealThiele> Although im sure the epic store exclusivity paid for all the dev time with how much money epic is tencenting around
[2:04:14] <penitentpentwitch> This looks like a job for youtube, BRB
[2:04:31] <%rottingpastry> I think the one you're missing you have to climb the yellow lab building then pull out some crystals
[2:04:32] <cokenegg> i hated the epic store until they bribed me by giving away killing floor for free
[2:04:35] <+SimplesRock> @RealThiele thank you for the gift of "tencent" as a verb. I will be saving that for later...
[2:04:36] <%rottingpastry> one of them anyway
[2:04:38] <cokenegg> so it's alright i guess
[2:04:43] <%LegendGHT> tenceting around is a good way to describe it
[2:04:54] <avidneptune> Don’t remember
[2:04:55] <Cruel_Tentacles> This game looks great but I still haven't bought it lol.
[2:04:56] <waltzqueen> twncwnt?
[2:05:15] <misterspotswood> is is by those dudes who made that time stop movie video game, yeah?
[2:05:16] <+misha_kastrilevich> Just joined, How's the Foundation DLC?
[2:05:32] <%rottingpastry> ayyy
[2:05:36] <penitentpentwitch> Victory!
[2:05:49] <Cruel_Tentacles> I did just spend £480 on the Seiko Prospex SNJP0251 though - Arnie's watch from Predator. Woo!
[2:05:53] <StebTheVee> because they wanna get the fuck out of there
[2:06:01] <penitentpentwitch> And the most important reward: More Lore
[2:06:18] <%rottingpastry> white hot mag-mah
[2:06:18] <%DensityD> delicious magma
[2:06:21] <cokenegg> oh my god he's actually reading all of the flavor text
[2:06:34] <$RealThiele> oh no, reading
[2:06:41] <%rottingpastry> The flavor text is half the reason the game is worth playing lol
[2:06:42] <amonimis> not enough black bars in these documents lol
[2:06:52] <%rottingpastry> Now solve the puzzle!
[2:06:53] <%DensityD> pat reads at
[2:06:57] <%DensityD> pat Blahs at
[2:06:57] <%rottingpastry> It's soooooo hard
[2:07:01] <+Javaa01> Now do the puzzle
[2:07:04] <morethantwo> One "Pat Reads At" ASMR channel please.

[2:07:28] <+sssoapy> Are you sure?
[2:07:34] <$drfaustisdead> environmental puzzle time.
[2:07:36] <Cruel_Tentacles> Boo, puzzles.
[2:07:45] <+razielhex> diggy-diggy hole
[2:07:47] <cokenegg> why would you need 5 id cards to use an elevator
[2:07:52] <%CalderGaming> he's doing it!
[2:08:03] <amonimis> this puzzle too galaxy brain for me
[2:08:06] <%rottingpastry> First try!
[2:08:14] <%Typhaeon> She says as if she can't fucking float
[2:08:19] <%DensityD> I've got my Dweeb pass
[2:08:24] <penitentpentwitch> A rare first "First Try"
[2:08:34] <waltzqueen> GOing DOWN
[2:08:40] <%DensityD> pick up that can
[2:08:41] <$RealThiele> i hate dust!
[2:08:43] <cokenegg> first try... on stream that is
[2:08:52] <%Lion_kun> I hope the final boss is Kaspar Darling being swole
[2:08:53] <%rottingpastry> lol it did cats
[2:09:04] <Cruel_Tentacles> Thought that said "Sneeze Accelerator" for a second.
[2:09:04] <+misha_kastrilevich> Is this game good?
[2:09:06] <+Javaa01> Remember that shower in that yellow prefab building that didn't work?
[2:09:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you've got a Newton's cradle on your desk you are a dweeb, confirmed
[2:09:11] <%Laecerelius> It still has snacks!
[2:09:13] <%Typhaeon> The zombie goasts aren't happy about you turning off the water pressure
[2:09:16] <+misha_kastrilevich> I heard a lot of mixed opinions on it
[2:09:32] <%rottingpastry> This game is great
[2:09:33] <%tattleworm> @PatStaresAt now that you turned that wheel, if you use that shower in the yellow building again you'll start a hidden quest to unlock a very powerful item
[2:09:36] <sonofcthulhu21> SilverLurk SilverLurk SilverLurk
[2:09:44] <%rottingpastry> FIGHT THE LAZOR BOSS
[2:09:46] <penitentpentwitch> Eyebeams!
[2:09:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> IMMA FIRING MA LAZOE
[2:10:07] <+sssoapy> nice lab no more
[2:10:08] <%honeyman18> I hate the birds
[2:10:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop
[2:10:16] <$RealThiele> this game is a functional shooter with powers, but if you like scp and alan wake it becomes much more interesting.
[2:10:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> WTF BOOOOOM
[2:10:25] <%CalderGaming> just tank it lol
[2:10:29] <%rottingpastry> lazor is bad for you
[2:10:31] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Pat you can't DPS race a lazer
[2:10:36] <%Typhaeon> Gibs from Doom
[2:10:36] <lyzejag> Holy shit
[2:10:37] <zachneely1119> can't wait for pat to dab on kojima
[2:10:40] <%Typhaeon> as in all over the floor
[2:10:40] <%CalderGaming> but he did
[2:10:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> LEROY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:10:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> He just did LUL
[2:10:50] <amonimis> has pat done a lot of grinding or is the combat actually just ezpz
[2:10:54] <%rottingpastry> BABBY NAIL
[2:10:54] <waltzqueen> this place got WRECKED
[2:10:55] <%king_wragles> He says, moments after beating a lazer in a DPS race
[2:10:57] <$drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt the valve is part of a special questline.
[2:10:58] <penitentpentwitch> Final Dungeon in 5.0 was practice for this Laser
[2:10:59] <$RealThiele> just use LB3
[2:11:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> Mini Nail
[2:11:02] <+sssoapy> Only nailier
[2:11:06] <cokenegg> @amonimis easy mode unlocked
[2:11:12] <%DensityD> the mini-nail, a ninny, if you will
[2:11:19] <%rottingpastry> It's not super hard combat on normal.
[2:11:28] <%honeyman18> Northmoor speaking like the board
[2:11:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> Human battery LUL
[2:11:51] <%CalderGaming> human fuel rod
[2:12:01] <+misha_kastrilevich> The Foundation. Jesus, they aren't even trying to hide where they got their inspiration from. Not that I'm complaining, this is probably the best SCP game we'll ever get
[2:12:02] <+ianabstract> can you touch the mini-nail?
[2:12:11] <$drfaustisdead> Yeah being the Director isn't great.
[2:12:17] <%NopeBadguy> Man he sounds mad. Like he's a salted battery Kappa
[2:12:18] <$RealThiele> tough talk for a duracell
[2:12:21] <+Javaa01> Okay yeah, so check these yellow buildings for a shower
[2:12:21] <iamdiosson> Eyes all over the walls
[2:12:21] <ivanmistwalker> I hope we fight the genarator
[2:12:26] <+Javaa01> Since you can use that now
[2:12:37] <%Piemen99> use the shower
[2:12:39] <%rottingpastry> They
[2:12:44] <penitentpentwitch> If you do the sidequests, it's several hours
[2:12:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its kinda...bland too
[2:12:49] <%rottingpastry> They're both like 4 - 6 if you actually read everything
[2:12:52] <avidneptune> I feel like this dlc is mostly setup for control 2
[2:12:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> I hope AWE is better
[2:12:59] <%Typhaeon> What a hero
[2:13:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Congrats Pat, you sure showed them.
[2:13:06] <Reizie_Etherealm> Dude didn't even flinch
[2:13:06] <%Wallabri> HE'S INVINCIBLE
[2:13:06] <cokenegg> on an unrelated note: the boys season 2 is gonna air next week PogChamp
[2:13:06] <%king_wragles> That rock phased through that guy?!
[2:13:10] <therakishsage> Didn't even flinch.
[2:13:11] <waltzqueen> invincible
[2:13:14] <StebTheVee> Favorite? You only knew two
[2:13:15] <TheTakkster> Why is pat playing control again?
[2:13:16] <+sssoapy> Why does she have lizard eyes
[2:13:25] <%rottingpastry> AWE is basically for Alan Wake nerds
[2:13:25] <$RealThiele> for me this is Nessus, minus the robots
[2:13:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> @TheTakkster New DLCs
[2:13:48] <%maenos2> why is blonde lady cosplaying as a subwoofer
[2:13:48] <%DensityD> side mouth
[2:13:49] <TheTakkster> ooh ok
[2:13:52] <cokenegg> she reminds me of someone
[2:13:52] <%king_wragles> Anyone else think their mouths are way off?
[2:13:55] <%rottingpastry> F!
[2:13:58] <royalstarlord> I noticed that their faces move like rubber D:
[2:14:01] <penitentpentwitch> Hi Former
[2:14:01] <%Piemono> "It was hard to tell after I threw a bunch of shit around with mind powers"
[2:14:02] <cokenegg> who is that actor
[2:14:10] <%Typhaeon> This guy I admire has illegible handwriting, I can't respect him anymore
[2:14:11] <waltzqueen> @king_wragles yeah and its super distracting
[2:14:15] <%DensityD> literal slack jaw
[2:14:15] <%king_wragles> It's like they're all botoxed
[2:14:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> Suffer? Like F did?
[2:14:16] <%cvp5127> nerd

[2:15:09] <amonimis> so where's this shower
[2:15:19] <$RealThiele> @Goergorion have a baggy with your name, SSN, and DOB written on it in a pocket

[2:15:45] <%honeyman18> find doggo
[2:15:45] <%DensityD> black iron tarkus?
[2:15:47] <penitentpentwitch> Time to find some giant trees
[2:15:48] <%rottingpastry> The Control of Dark Souls
[2:15:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> Dork Souls
[2:15:54] <%maenos2> honestly i'm getting more a vibe of the whoel nightmare frontier place myself
[2:15:55] <StebTheVee> too dark
[2:16:03] <%rottingpastry> um
[2:16:04] <%cowardman93> black knight gonna come from your left
[2:16:13] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 6 Pat 2

[2:16:17] <%NopeBadguy> indeed
[2:16:17] <%Typhaeon> is this Anor Londo
[2:16:18] <BeagleCypher> Eaten by Grue
[2:16:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> MOMENT
[2:16:20] <+Javaa01> Yeah don't jump into the endless void
[2:16:21] <amonimis> ???
[2:16:25] <$RealThiele> hydra doesnt do non-union work
[2:16:31] <cokenegg> i alt tabbed for 4 seconds and he somehow died wtf
[2:16:32] <%cowardman93> same for real life then
[2:16:33] <%NopeBadguy> clearly you should play gravity rush
[2:16:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Orb weak to Gravity types
[2:16:38] <DominoAxiom> Shine flashlight at TV to see better
[2:16:39] <%rottingpastry> The nail is getting harder
[2:16:43] <Reizie_Etherealm> This is the true reason Woolie is obsessed over jetpacks
[2:16:43] <%maenos2> we are all victims of physics pat
[2:16:53] <penitentpentwitch> The Dark Souls analogy was more spot on than you thought
[2:17:11] <+Javaa01> There's a cave in those shadows
[2:17:12] <%rottingpastry> You are correct!
[2:17:16] <%tanarath> if only you could solve gravity in this game, Pat.
[2:17:17] <therakishsage> That wall looked break-worthy.
[2:17:17] <+Javaa01> It's very hard to see
[2:17:22] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt To be fair Gravity is a strong rival to have
[2:17:38] <$RealThiele> nah its a weak force
[2:17:38] <penitentpentwitch> Gotta go the long way round
[2:17:45] <%honeyman18> Pat your crystals

[2:22:43] <$RealThiele> they are too spongy for how samey they are
[2:22:55] <DraxTD> Thanks for the HyperParkour @giantratthatmakestherulz
[2:23:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> The progression in Remedy games feel like it's fixed or static, it's not great
[2:23:07] <+Javaa01> You might wanna check the astral constructs menu at a control point, you should be able to upgrade your general mod level there
[2:23:09] <$RealThiele> PARKOUR!
[2:23:11] <%mikessdd> This game looks pretty good. Should I buy it on pc?
[2:23:12] <%rottingpastry> I guess that's a way to do it
[2:23:15] <+Javaa01> Since they added a new one with updates
[2:23:21] <$drfaustisdead> They actually balanced them down from the release, they use to be even spongier.
[2:23:27] <cokenegg> thats some pretty good glass physics
[2:23:46] <cokenegg> wait this place looks really cool
[2:23:49] <penitentpentwitch> There it is... The Cat

[2:25:33] <$drfaustisdead> Man the firebreaks are so visually striking.
[2:25:35] <royalstarlord> His ki blasts are bullets. He is his own gun. :V
[2:25:36] <$RealThiele> when he comes to america they just gave him one its customary
[2:25:37] <+Javaa01> And now lvl 5 mods start showing up more commonly
[2:25:41] <%rottingpastry> Doesn't change the drops
[2:25:54] <penitentpentwitch> Done do'ed it
[2:26:22] <%rottingpastry> Well, to be fair, I don't know that. I just upgraded that shit as soon as I could
[2:26:40] <+Javaa01> It does affect drop rates
[2:26:54] <$RealThiele> you now Prosess Gibbs whine
[2:26:57] <+G_Thunders> One thing I forgot until the end of this DLC- any painting of a door has a breakable wall behind it
[2:27:01] <+Javaa01> So now for example, lvl 3 mods should be very rare as drops
[2:27:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[2:29:38] <KnightAsteran> @reizie_etherealm have you met people?
[2:29:48] <KnightAsteran> horny is to exist
[2:30:01] <penitentpentwitch> In some cases it's not even horniness, it's just low hanging fruit lewd humor
[2:30:02] <KnightAsteran> to exist is to be horny
[2:30:21] <avidneptune> Is guard 1 still alive

[2:30:54] <penitentpentwitch> A rare time the flunky lived
[2:31:00] <%honeyman18> So once you leave that dude dies right?

[3:27:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Fuck the board
[3:27:24] <%bread_assassin> Former was kinda cool. I feel bad for attempting to kill him when he first appeared in the DLC.
[3:27:35] <ape_hawk> goddamn triangle assholes
[3:27:37] <%RyTYoung> Attitude adjustment required
[3:27:40] <penitentpentwitch> One of the side caves leads out
[3:27:42] <$drfaustisdead> I'm not I'm glad it reacts.
[3:27:46] <+Javaa01> And now you just gotta find all the shit you missed, and you missed a lot
[3:27:47] <%Lone_Xeno> Fuck this wall
[3:27:49] <+Take_2_shots> Follow the god rays?
[3:28:00] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @drfaustisdead more like the Sound out of space

[3:29:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:29:11] <+reemasbaid> WOULD YOU SAY CONTROL IS BETTER THAN ALAN WAKE?
[3:29:23] <dalishprince> is this the first dlc? just got here

[3:29:25] <indigo_automaton> @rottingpastry Nah HISS LIFE

[3:29:41] <%SirGO0SE> Clap
[3:29:43] <%Lone_Xeno> Objective: Await and Anticipate Future Content
[3:29:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You could say im in... AWE

[3:30:26] <%BlackJack607> Is this how SCP started?
[3:30:28] <ape_hawk> emily, wanna kiss on the lips and also the mouth?
[3:30:37] <indigo_automaton> Embily
[3:30:37] <+yoshkosh20> oh, suprise pizza parties every other day.

[3:30:53] <%Jaxnos> god emily your face got super creepy inbetween adventures
[3:30:54] <%Movemeister> nail anti terror field
[3:31:04] <+yoshkosh20> oh man. their faces are spooky
[3:31:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Free cancer PogChamp
[3:31:09] <%Totally_Not_Toby> oh boy, radiation!
[3:31:09] <+ALazo> nail juice in the air
[3:31:14] <%Lone_Xeno> Sick, we're all dying of radiation poisoning
[3:31:23] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Pope is great
[3:31:30] <$drfaustisdead> and breathing in rust.
[3:31:33] <+AcidMatter> Whats wrong with there jaw
[3:31:39] <+yoshkosh20> those super powers? cancer induced hallucinations.
[3:31:55] <ape_hawk> "hey director, clean under our nail"
[3:32:12] <%Jaxnos> Jesse is just projecting her inner Stallone
[3:32:13] <+Pyroclase> I've heard people complain this DLC answers too many questions and strips away the mystery. No idea what they're talking about...
[3:32:13] <ape_hawk> BADUM TISH
[3:32:14] <penitentpentwitch> "He's our leading Duracell!"
[3:32:22] <Virokwet> such trustworthy otherworldly entities
[3:32:27] <%rottingpastry> Forced to be a battery
[3:32:46] <$Zalthia> mmm
[3:32:52] <juliachangbang> Everyones mouth is so large
[3:32:53] <%Lone_Xeno> Forma
[3:32:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Dont say that next to the nail XD
[3:33:00] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt so what is the deal with the board?
[3:33:00] <ape_hawk> out the door with you, eldritch gods who exist in another dimension
[3:33:02] <indigo_automaton> ATTACK AND DETHRONE THE BOARD
[3:33:13] <%CrookedSpiral> there's something unsettling about their mouth movements
[3:33:20] <%rottingpastry> That's for Control 2
[3:33:28] <%reonome> yeah the mocap is fucked
[3:33:29] <ape_hawk> do more ass dives
[3:33:34] <penitentpentwitch> Board: "We can't stand your lust for Paninis any more! We exile you!"
[3:33:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @CrookedSpiral For some reason Pat's game has the jaws shifted to the left. Just booted my game and Jesse's jaw is normal
[3:34:00] <%Jaxnos> you can see they didn't finish cleaning the rigging because that second to last paragraph Emily spoke, her mouth looked more natural.
[3:34:03] <+Estuko> PogChamp I made some money trading online, pretty much got a free cheeseburger from the $1 menu
[3:34:06] <+G_Thunders> Former better get his panini in the sequel
[3:34:07] <%Razputin217> OH SHIT
[3:34:10] <%BinaryFireball> you shall never grill a sandwich again!
[3:34:17] <%Jaxnos> oh so it might just be a bug? interesting @XeroSigmaPrime
[3:34:21] <%Lone_Xeno> @CrookedSpiral The movements are unnecessarily dramatic for mundane speech
[3:34:22] <+ALazo> "Better to live in exile than to live in lack of panini."
[3:34:25] <%Razputin217> Tomasi gonna dunk on you quiettHA
[3:34:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Th3SmartAlec subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! begone sub notification
[3:34:57] <$Zalthia> Alright well. I should get food before AWE time.
[3:35:10] <%honeyman18> Snoopy stays in this house!
[3:35:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Jaxnos Yea, Jesse's jaw in pat's game is always ajar for some reason. I just booted up a scene in this DLC and her Jaw is normal
[3:35:13] <%BinaryFireball> is the board aliens?
[3:35:15] <%rottingpastry> Jesse/Dylan Faden
[3:35:17] <ape_hawk> FUCK YOU, BOARD! EMILY IS STAYING AND WE'RE HAVING PIZZA TOGETHER WITHOUT YOU!
[3:35:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> awwwwwwww BibleThump
[3:35:30] <Cal_ixo> CALLED HER JESSE/DYLAN?
[3:35:30] <indigo_automaton> @XeroSigmaPrime Yeah in my game as well, it's like everyone's jaws are slightly dislocated
[3:35:34] <$Zalthia> Awwwwwwwww
[3:35:35] <+ALazo> cool, food time
[3:35:36] <+Javaa01> Ordinary AWE I think
[3:35:47] <+Pyroclase> I think Turntable is in the new sector?
[3:35:48] <SaltyAzteca> AWE BibleThump
[3:35:51] <+Pyroclase> or there's two
[3:35:51] <+G_Thunders> Oh shit, she IS interchangeable Jesse/Dylan
[3:35:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> Do you have to do Foundation b4 AWE?
[3:35:58] <+crunchygrl> [Consume/Flat] [Italian/Absolute] [Forbidden/Yum]
[3:36:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @indigo_automaton Are you on DX11? Im on DX12
[3:36:07] <penitentpentwitch> Oh well, more Control next week
[3:36:08] <%arcielardor> Saturday stream?
[3:36:09] <%rottingpastry> There is no order.
[3:36:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> Cool ill do AWE over the weeken then
[3:36:35] <indigo_automaton> @XeroSigmaPrime PS4 Pro so whatever that has
[3:36:38] <SaltyAzteca> oooh
[3:36:39] <%reonome> PogChamp
[3:36:40] <shurtal> Only one turntable, and i'm guessing zero microphones
[3:36:40] <%miguelrod777> Ah yeah
[3:36:47] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp Scheduled Peach Stream
[3:36:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> For some reason, running this game on DX11 has their Haws ajar. DX12 never has the issue
[3:36:58] <%miguelrod777> can't wait to see her cry on camera again
[3:37:01] <+loukemia83> Peach should be good at Fallguys, it is basically her everyday life
[3:37:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @indigo_automaton So DX11
[3:37:06] <%Jaxnos> that's super satisfying, they just become fucking ether now
[3:37:23] <+harry_macdougall> harry_macdougall subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! i sub now for the dog not pat
[3:37:23] <indigo_automaton> @XeroSigmaPrime That's bizarre as shit
[3:37:27] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a gottem
[3:37:30] <%SirGO0SE> +2
[3:37:35] <$RealThiele> you gotta move forward to win tho
[3:37:39] <Cal_ixo> IT'S NOT CALLED FALL INTO GLASS GUYS....
[3:37:45] <+RyTYoung> Probably
[3:37:49] <%honeyman18> Control is cool, just needs more RAM
[3:37:51] <%miguelrod777> what's awe
[3:37:51] <%Lone_Xeno> Its not the stream pat
[3:37:59] <%cvp5127> why is paige announcing a stream a month in advanced ?
[3:37:59] <+Javaa01> There's a staircase
[3:38:02] <%bread_assassin> I like AWE considerably more than Foundation.
[3:38:02] <+G_Thunders> It’s because the
[3:38:10] <%RyTYoung> @miguelrod777 the newest expansion to Control
[3:38:13] <+G_Thunders> Fall Guys tournament has been going since your stream started
[3:38:14] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt the school year is restarting in the US. You might be seeing less numbers due to that.
[3:38:17] <%Lone_Xeno> @miguelrod777 Altered World Event
[3:38:32] <%rottingpastry> Children watch this stream?
[3:38:37] <%rottingpastry> God I hope not
[3:38:37] <%RyTYoung> @bread_assassin Shorter or longer than Foundation?
[3:38:40] <penitentpentwitch> Wait. Has Peach announced when she's doing Fall Guys or is it another last minute thing?
[3:38:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[3:38:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> Alan Wake Event
[3:38:48] <indigo_automaton> @miguelrod777 Always Watch Esports
[3:38:59] <%rottingpastry> AWE felt shorter than Foundation
[3:39:01] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do they have plans for more than just these 2 DLCs?
[3:39:03] <%Jaxnos> you. did it.
[3:39:21] <%rottingpastry> No plans for Control as far as I know
[3:39:33] <%Lion_kun> OH BOY
[3:39:38] <%Lion_kun> THIS WAS SUPER FUCKING HARD
[3:39:41] <%Lion_kun> took me hours
[3:39:42] <%bread_assassin> @RyTYoung I don't think one took me noticeably longer than the other. I think the map is smaller in AWE, though.
[3:39:47] <%Razputin217> If you beat him in one I’m gonna shit
[3:39:55] <%Lion_kun> hopefully pat is overlevelled enough
[3:40:17] <%Lion_kun> well didn't do it in one
[3:40:18] <$apolitenoob> Save your shit for another time, Raz
[3:40:18] <penitentpentwitch> Post-Game boss has slaps
[3:40:21] <%rottingpastry> I don't remember Tommasi being too bad
[3:40:23] <%Lone_Xeno> psaUp
[3:40:25] <iunderstoodthatreference> Yeah, I hated this boss fight XD
[3:40:35] <%Razputin217> My ass is saved quiettHA
[3:41:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> Good hits
[3:41:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Jaxnos Figured out the issue. For some reason when starting Control in DX11/12, itll run executable for the opposite version (like 70% of the time). Its a fucking weird bug that also exists on consoles somehow
[3:41:43] <%Totally_Not_Toby> only reason tommasi can be tough is that he gets those screamers after you
[3:42:00] <%Totally_Not_Toby> those invisible fuckers suck
[3:42:04] <%rottingpastry> stealth spitting fucks are awful
[3:42:21] <%Totally_Not_Toby> nice
[3:42:23] <%rottingpastry> You can use shield on them
[3:42:34] <+Pyroclase> This game has the only near-invisible enemy I have ever found genuinely difficult to see when I'm looking for it.
[3:42:45] <SaltyAzteca> NOIPE
[3:42:46] <penitentpentwitch> Chill denied
[3:42:50] <$apolitenoob> Zero chill
[3:42:55] <+Nutford> brutal
[3:42:57] <amonimis> no chill here
[3:42:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO :)
[3:43:06] <%Lone_Xeno> Can we all just chill? *proceeds with murderous intent*
[3:43:10] <%Totally_Not_Toby> same
[3:43:17] <%rottingpastry> It's not super hard to see EXCEPT it looks just like the random hiss haze that shows up for no reason
[3:43:19] <+razielhex> Even worse than the Spectre Pinkies in DOOM?
[3:43:21] <+Pyroclase> I think it's because it fills the whole area with additional blurry effects, maybe?
[3:43:22] <%tanarath> Maybe chill + cover
[3:43:25] <%RyTYoung> True, it's a bit tough to see it
[3:43:29] <+Javaa01> It's not very hard to keep track of however if you can avoid whipping your camera around for no real reason
[3:43:40] <+Javaa01> Spectres in Doom are a joke
[3:43:45] <%Jaxnos> @XeroSigmaPrime yeah, that sounds like such a thing that even if they caught it, it would be placed on low priority not only because it's not game-breaking but also because of how odd it is. thanks for the heads up
[3:44:08] <penitentpentwitch> The Adds, always the most dangerous of any boss fight
[3:44:16] <iunderstoodthatreference> I had to go on the top catwalks and cheese it a bit
[3:44:23] <+razielhex> WHELPS! 50 DKP MINUS
[3:44:33] <penitentpentwitch> Good shield timing there
[3:44:34] <%rottingpastry> shield trivializes so many things lol
[3:44:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> @razielhex LUL
[3:44:53] <SaltyAzteca> StinkyCheese
[3:44:54] <%Totally_Not_Toby> the problem with the screamers in this is their invisible indicator is Hiss distortion, which is already everywhere
[3:45:37] <penitentpentwitch> All hail Peirce!
[3:45:40] <+Nutford> ez
[3:45:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> No fuss, no muss
[3:45:51] <%reonome> rip tommasi
[3:46:13] <%Razputin217> Dammit this fight took me literal days to beat!
[3:46:16] <%Jaxnos> piersh
[3:46:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Twitch desktop keeps saying you're offline. wtf
[3:47:02] <%rottingpastry> Basically it's a terminator orb
[3:47:15] <catalyst40> It took me several days as well. Found out, I had to use Pierce.
[3:47:19] <SaltyAzteca> It does not REDACTED, interesting...
[3:47:21] <+Javaa01> People use the Twitch desktop app for anything other then the free Prime games?
[3:47:28] <royalstarlord> It's hollow? Can you go inside it? :Uc
[3:47:40] <+Pyroclase> I love the Burea using a fake conspiracy radio show to spread misinformation about actual supernatural events.
[3:48:12] <%Totally_Not_Toby> love America Overnight
[3:48:30] <%rottingpastry> America Overnight was great until fondue
[3:48:35] <%Totally_Not_Toby> conspiracies = real
[3:48:41] <penitentpentwitch> When in doubt, cover a conspiracy with another conspiracy
[3:48:50] <Daxalog> Why would the government keep aliens a secret?
[3:48:57] <%honeyman18> why the yellow stains?
[3:48:59] <+Javaa01> Now you just gotta talk to Emily in Exec
[3:49:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> America Overnight or Nightsprings which one is better?
[3:49:24] <%Lone_Xeno> Its just a giant d12 for when god feels like playing D&D
[3:50:16] <%Totally_Not_Toby> RAWRF
[3:50:36] <penitentpentwitch> It'll be real awkward if they ever find a way to 'Cure' hissification
