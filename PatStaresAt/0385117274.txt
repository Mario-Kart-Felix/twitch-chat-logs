[0:22:37] <QaizerArt> You wouldn't survive at all in Silent Hill, it would fuck with your OCD and make everything just a LITTLE off-kilter. @AngriestPat
[0:22:37] <%ORGANizerC> Harry Mason wasn't all messed up but he still had to deal with stuff
[0:22:38] <+Zerodyne90> well just stay home and youre good
[0:22:40] <+emperor_z> Id venture to say that the Silent Hill games in general have a MUCH higher survival rate than Resident Evil. Plus, you might learn something about yourself
[0:22:40] <Guardiansaiyan> @Potato hello! Are you related to POTaTOS
[0:22:40] <%rdark_ksu> I saw my first irl gun when i was like 4 and dad came back with deer

[0:22:45] <+Disraged> Cliffy B isnt sponsored by Red Bull

[0:30:55] <+king_of_beggars> I've never been more confused about whether someone is sponsored or if they just got free stuff. This is weird advertising.
[0:30:57] <%SrG00SE> WF enemies melt in your presence, dodging isnt real
[0:30:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> What is dodge offset, everybody?
[0:30:59] <echodrone81> oh god saw an ad for anthem, even the ad was choppy
[0:31:02] <%valriot> Oh. Fake Offset
[0:31:02] <Mnightshyamallama> I feel like it sounds more complicated that what it is
[0:31:03] <Okcfooser> im so bored of warframe tired of endless mode shit
[0:31:08] <%Nuclearcherries> Did you see that anthem is already in bargain bins?
[0:31:08] <%AllYouCanYeet> I felt galaxy brain when I learned dodge offset
[0:31:09] <%konekoryugamine> How choppy was the Anthem ad?
[0:31:13] <awalr> dodge offset is when you can do combo
[0:31:15] <%Pappajimbo> if you can doge a wrench you can doge a warframe
[0:31:19] <%Mendin> Normal Combo: Hit 1, Hit 2, Hit 3 Dodge Offset: Hit 1, Hit 2, (dodge), Hit 3
[0:31:19] <%EarthenLantern> Oh cool thanks
[0:31:20] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Started playing Everspace. It's super good.
[0:31:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> I just got first blood in Apex
[0:31:21] <OwlLightningMage> It's not actually dodge offest as much as it is any action offset
[0:31:22] <%Kenori> Oh I hevent been on a live show since I subbed. Hello Pat!
[0:31:22] <echodrone81> it was skipping frames in the ad
[0:31:22] <SirBrawler18> good evening pat.
[0:31:23] <Worldbrand> Anything that tanky would normally die faster to quick melee than combos, so we'll have to wait for phase 2 for anything actually juicy
[0:31:27] <%lewdskeletor13> KappaPride
[0:31:29] <%valriot> woo
[0:31:30] <CalderGaming> combo continues when dodging, doesn't matter when you're oneshotting every boss with guns and reserving melee for Dynasty Warriors-style slaughter
[0:31:30] <Deimos002> Explain it to the people who don't play that garbage game pls OpieOP
[0:31:31] <%RCtiger0> I don't think Bioware will exist give or take 3 years
[0:31:31] <natebud> The ad was not great
[0:31:36] <%Mendin> Combo without dodge offset: Hit 1, Hit 2, (Dodge), Hit 1...
[0:31:36] <+king_of_beggars> @AngriestPat Are you actually sponsored or no? This is weird advertising.
[0:31:37] <starotter70> IT'S FORREST
[0:31:38] <ReiDuran> Imagine instead of making the enemies more durable in Warframe, they double the amount of enemies and make it like a mix of DMC and Dynasty Warriors.
[0:31:39] <%SrG00SE> jill sandwich for life
[0:31:39] <OwlLightningMage> You can cancel any action and continue your combo
[0:31:39] <ArthurDoyleRPG> !dodgeoffset
[0:31:41] <+mechslayer71> @blue6sub6remnant6 Bayonetta, dodge mid combo and continue combo after words, huge boost in dps and combo points

[0:49:58] <echodrone81> oh god alita was fucking trash
[0:50:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Pat, saw you drop in on the last 2 Minutes of Clemps stream. It'll be cool to see you two doing some streaming.

[0:50:36] <ScreamingMeat> We may be getting a Dragon's Dogma 2 after DMC5 comes out. The guy directing DMC5 also wanted to do DD2 but couldn't do both and chose DMC5. SO plans might still be being made
[0:50:38] <WotanCR> it just works

[0:50:47] <Guardiansaiyan> @nairb136 hello!
[0:50:48] <%ElenaManetta> that's item management horror
[0:50:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Resident Evil isn't really that spooky
[0:50:50] <Clyderso> rip Shitstorm
[0:50:54] <KaptainKappathe5th> horror elements are different from horror
[0:50:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember when you chickened out of 3rd Strike with @angriestpat
[0:50:59] <timetraveller2000> Pat didn’t care about horror? What?
[0:51:01] <JoshyJ> RE is more meme horror than actual horror
[0:51:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Kappa
[0:51:03] <%GohanEgret> @FriendlyCheer that's more psychological, pat means jump scare/big scary stuff
[0:51:03] <%Spydurman> WOOOOO
[0:51:03] <%lemuhollow> When's the ShitStorm?
[0:51:04] <pokketlint60> Pat doesn't like Horror 'cause he screams like a girl at jumpscares
[0:51:04] <+TheImmortal70> It's the horror of having to figure out what to put where
[0:51:05] <ZeonAceVS> RIP ShitStorm
[0:51:05] <%megabrogus> says the dude who did 7 years of shitstorm
[0:51:06] <+elsievoid> @blue6sub6remnant6 yup them

[0:58:22] <%foreverN2dust> PETA is a terrorist group anyways so who cares.
[0:58:25] <%RCtiger0> They should be talking shit about the stingray instead
[0:58:28] <%Rngiddion> PETA being scum? news at 11
[0:58:29] <SubjectX07x> PETA also thinks that Cooking Mama is fucking satan soooooo...
[0:58:30] <%Mr_Strut> Peta are a combination of corrupt leaders and moral busybodies that act as useful idiots
[0:58:32] <@SSaryn> Oh boi lots of PETA hate. Which is deserved.
[0:58:33] <LemonPerspiration> Screw them!
[0:58:33] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @SSaryn no it's fine he likes to think he treated them fine that's the same as treating them as basic human beings right
[0:58:34] <%ElenaManetta> I feel like the government needs to step in and shut PETA down. They've done more harm than good.
[0:58:35] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat that doesn't work you get a set cost and if you keep asking for stupid shit i think they give you a PB & J
[0:58:37] <jobbedbone> Its national stingray day!
[0:58:37] <VRNK> peta's probably killed more animals than they've helped
[0:58:41] <Gruhunchously> Peta literally puts down shelter cats and dogs for no good reason. Fuck them.
[0:58:42] <KeystoneA1> PETA has killed more animals than Steve ever did, and he didn't kill any AFAIK

[1:01:28] <tadaosmad> Reworks are a failure of the game designer
[1:01:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Literally won a match on a squad with Caustic by doing nothing but hanging out in the bunker with gas traps
[1:01:31] <+nairb136> BUT HE'S SO EDGY
[1:01:32] <SubjectX07x> Caustic isn't really bad, I just feel people don't fucking play him right.
[1:01:33] <+Dylanstafford1> I like caustic whys everyone hate him
[1:01:34] <+Zxtole> Mirage is worse
[1:01:36] <KeystoneA1> @Corporate_Redeemer I remember that shit, and I remember how arrogant and smug they were about it. It's so fucking satisfying to see them about to get shot in the back of the head by EA.
[1:01:37] <+ArcanumMBD> caustic is fine. if you think he's bad you're playing him wrong
[1:01:45] <%Verd_254> He's a good trolling character, can lock people in rooms and gas em.
[1:01:45] <@SSaryn> Oh yeah.
[1:01:45] <pectusumbra> I saw a video of someone using that guy to trap a team in a makeshift gas chamber. kind of messed up, kind of hilarious
[1:01:54] <%terribleusername> get your own name engraved on it
[1:01:55] <ScreamingMeat> @gnarly_memes_bro Yeah, that's what I said.
[1:01:56] <+mechslayer71> Mirage’s ult is terrible tho. But Caustic has the thick hit box, which is super bad for shooter
[1:01:56] <%CJett92> @ArcanumMBD This. I have a ton of fun with him
[1:01:56] <%zerocruz> DMC V Kreygasm
[1:01:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@kenpachi9211) (warning)
[1:02:00] <ArthurDoyleRPG> How long is pre stream usually?
[1:02:00] <+TheImmortal70> He is a larger target that hunkers down in a movement based shooter
[1:02:01] <SubjectX07x> Caustic is, by all means a guy meant to literally gas people in a small room with no exits.
[1:02:06] <Rezroc> The fact that Caustic ISNT VOICE BY PETER STORMARE is a crime!
[1:02:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague of Gripes made a really good point, he's a character that excels in indoors environments in a game that's mostly outdoors.
[1:02:11] <+TheImmortal70> That is by definition a bad character
[1:02:13] <McAngrimStein> @SubjectX07x Like all fat people
[1:02:22] <Josef_Stryker> @AngriestPat Hey are u interested in coming back to For Honor to try out the new Edgy Knight or maybe the Shugoki rework? Or would u prefer to wait for next season in April/May since Lawbringer is confirmed for a rework next season?

[1:03:41] <+TheImmortal70> @owllightningmage the best part is that the game has shown that it's going to have a shit ton of new mechanics/different gameplay style so you might like this one
[1:03:41] <%gnarly_memes_bro> thats a weird way to say gears 2
[1:03:41] <McAngrimStein> CliffyB's a shit head, but that's no reason to look poorly on games like Gears

[1:14:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Really is not threatening when he just slows up within arm's distance
[1:14:54] <%ooblagis> THE OTHER mod
[1:14:55] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Honestly it seems easier to have him never lose his hat because shooting him is kinda pointless
[1:14:56] <FutaSnek> true
[1:14:56] <Skitsoguy> This game is freaking amazing
[1:14:58] <nobknee> Coward, right.
[1:15:00] <%SrG00SE> theres a midi one
[1:15:00] <tadaosmad> The OTHER mod
[1:15:00] <natebud> First time through I hid on the staircase as Claire.
[1:15:03] <tadaosmad> The thong
[1:15:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Midi-DMX tho
[1:15:04] <%ooblagis> Wrong mod Pat
[1:15:04] <azacca_bitter> Woof
[1:15:04] <%foreverN2dust> old meme is old
[1:15:04] <$cureneckbeard> Just hum the song to yourself
[1:15:05] <studleydoorite> why aren't you singing the song then?
[1:15:05] <FutaSnek> copyright
[1:15:06] <lbrownthedestroyer> TOS gonna give it to you
[1:15:06] <%Typhaeon> Only thing X gon' deliver on Twitch is a VOD mute
[1:15:07] <%DatGuyJimbo> thong mod
[1:15:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@metrying) (warning)
[1:15:08] <Kaitepaints> Ok woooooooow, I just saw the whole cliffy b shit
[1:15:09] <+elsievoid> Why aren't you using the thong mod?
[1:15:09] <%GianniVoices> because you can hear it in your soul anyway
[1:15:09] <$cureneckbeard> rap for us pat
[1:15:09] <Zebroneath> Don't want any copyright shit happening
[1:15:10] <WaxWitch> also it probably gets annoying quick
[1:15:10] <%Plague_Nurse> people are dumb, Pat
[1:15:10] <Yrefe> NOO pat, the speedo mod!
[1:15:11] <%connos_livereview> shouldve used the ricardo mod instead
[1:15:12] <screaminidiot> i thought that mod got banned? for copyright?
[1:15:13] <Gruhunchously> It's what you're hearn' (Listen)
[1:15:14] <@SSaryn> Also probably can't use the thong.
[1:15:14] <Frostydough> Stupid sexy Mr X
[1:15:14] <%GohanEgret> replace it with Clowns Farting In the Basement
[1:15:15] <echodrone81> he put in work it's all for rhe kid's but these stars done forgot what work is🎵
[1:15:15] <%yeknomlive> is there a mod for a midi version of the song?
[1:15:16] <KeystoneA1> Get the one with him in a thong and sunglasses
[1:15:17] <%JurassicRebel> It's all about Mr. Sex now...
[1:15:18] <CalderGaming> 3
[1:15:19] <%Gogogolem> We have to supply our own dmx sound track
[1:15:20] <+HelloImTom08> think of the VOD viewers D:
[1:15:20] <shadowboss89> Why not the Mr. Sex mod?
[1:15:22] <%lewdskeletor13> The thong mod woulda been good
[1:15:23] <GMN1> just beat those copyright guys and it's fine
[1:15:24] <devanmuse> is there a copyright safe version of the DMX mod?
[1:15:25] <+TawnyMonarch> kinda weird how he runs up on you in vhs fast fwd then slows down upon getting within danger distance
[1:15:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mr X music replaced with the Thomas the Tank Engine theme
[1:15:27] <dekkitout> Then get the chiptune version tajC
[1:15:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> You should at least do the Banana Hammock Mr. X mod. That probably WON'T get TOS.
[1:15:29] <%Xxstevo69xX > did u forget the club key by the shed near the water valve?
[1:15:29] <%galaxyswirl> the DMX song appears to not mute audio
[1:15:30] <someweirdo227> MR.X vs. Q, who wins?
[1:15:31] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat It would be great if DMX gave blanket permission for RE2 Satire using his song
[1:15:32] <metrying> Thomas the tank engine then BRouuuuU
[1:15:33] <+PenmanLupine> Mr. Banana Hammock mod
[1:15:34] <%Das_Bass> would the midi one get striked?
[1:15:36] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Stupid sexy Mr. X
[1:15:37] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat Why aren't you using the orig soundtrack??
[1:15:37] <%laserbeaming> Why arent you using the mod that gives MR X a thong then?
[1:15:42] <Johker> How's he supposed to get Cliffy B levels of cash if he's playing copywritten music? Think people.

[1:16:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> same @natebud
[1:16:16] <Kaitepaints> “Ok maybe I used a hyperbole but I like to think I did the right thing” defines that man. He’d prefer to think he’s a good man than face any internal conflict

[1:16:22] <%PelySux22> didnt knew about that
[1:16:22] <dekkitout> Mr. X just wants to show you a glimpse of your future
[1:16:22] <Shadicara> Was really hoping it glitched and there would be two Mr X
[1:16:23] <Ion_LaserX> IT'S REAL
[1:16:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Sxy_T_Rex I know, it really takes away from the experience.
[1:16:23] <$nademonkey1100> ive never seen him do that
[1:16:25] <%Typhaeon> The thing X gave to him was a shortcut. How nice
[1:16:26] <+HexMasterMike> He does it on any difficulty
[1:16:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @CJett92 he does it on normal
[1:16:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @CJett92 he does it in regular modes too
[1:16:27] <%radda343> he does that on any mode, it's just random
[1:16:28] <lloyddboy> DONGLE
[1:16:29] <studleydoorite> @CJett92 no he did that on my normal game
[1:16:30] <%Laecerelius> MAGANUM!
[1:16:32] <GameXful2> @CJett92 he does it on normal too, it's just random
[1:16:35] <timetraveller2000> I feel like hardcore gives you way too many ink ribbons for being the hardest difficulty :/ maybe that’s just me though
[1:16:38] <%AdmiralButtloaf> get the stuff for the clock puzzle
[1:16:38] <echodrone81> counting down until the MR XXX/Clair redfield SFM
[1:16:38] <%Kage_96> @CJett92 Nah he did it on a standard playthrough for me4

[1:16:47] <%LethargicRush> get the dong
[1:16:47] <%HyperCharge_Sam> he does that if you run straight down there, it happened to me on normal
[1:16:48] <CorvoBrooks> A wall is just a door with no opening
[1:16:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @MaxonMashville nope

[1:17:06] <natebud> @VRNK actually yes 96

[1:17:19] <Shadicara> Man he's really fast
[1:17:20] <ZephynM> So I guess when I want X to break through that wall, I want to go straight there. Last run he didn't do that for me, he just clomped in circles.
[1:17:20] <+ChaosVulpes> Is it just me or does he look like Q?
[1:17:21] <$nademonkey1100> ill be honest i like MrX wih the hat more

[1:21:18] <metrying> who woulda thunk pat
[1:21:19] <Erimos> Pretty sure adaptive difficulty is basically non-existent in Hardcore. It's locked to the maximum setting.

[1:21:33] <%GohanEgret> @ElenaManetta isn't that just tofu
[1:21:43] <Gruhunchously> Who is Paige
[1:21:43] <FirearmsInstructor> It's 6 or 7
[1:21:43] <McAngrimStein> @Erimos Hardcore has the top 2 adaptive difficulties, but there's little difference
[1:21:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige is dead
[1:21:45] <iamnotaparrot> Pat says; when in doubt, blame a black!
[1:21:48] <%Yokuho> @AngriestPat So you`re saying that watching Woolie playing it so badly you are getting bad at it yourself?
[1:21:49] <+Omegaanimus> Its like Pat had a clean sink and then put that firstdirty dish in.
[1:21:50] <%ooblagis> Do Zombies actually have random health, or is it just the adaptive difficulty and crosshair bonus?
[1:21:52] <frozenwaifu> paige is in prison for murder
[1:21:54] <+nairb136> Do they give a lot of ink ribbons in hardcore?
[1:21:56] <VRNK> did paige break another door
[1:21:57] <echodrone81> Paige is pregnant and trying to hide the big ass ring
[1:22:02] <Erimos> @McAngrimStein Didn't know that. Good to know.
[1:22:03] <GameXful2> @nairb136 yes.
[1:22:07] <McAngrimStein> Hardcore's highest adaptive difficulty is one Standard can't even get to
[1:22:09] <%connos_livereview> osmosis
[1:22:09] <+Nomicro4u> implying
[1:22:10] <+8framelag> maybe
[1:22:12] <+G_Thunders> On Hardcore the weapons do 70% normal damage no matter what anyway
[1:22:13] <%kenpachi9211> OK so should I have a reload count
[1:22:14] <echodrone81> pat would totally get her a massive rock
[1:22:14] <MaxonMashville> BUT
[1:22:14] <%Yokuho> I see
[1:22:16] <%GingaNZ> Paige in jail for door based crimes
[1:22:17] <GameXful2> thye give you like 25+ ink ribbons
[1:22:18] <CorvoBrooks> I think they give about 20 ink ribons
[1:22:21] <Ion_LaserX> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[1:22:21] <%lewdskeletor13> BUT
[1:22:23] <garbageheaphound> its plausible
[1:22:29] <%Shadowthedigger> apatDab
[1:22:31] <PSI_Guy95> Pro tip for adaptive difficulty: be bad at the game so you can be good at the gmae
[1:22:32] <danknugglit> Maybe youre just not as good as you think LUL
[1:22:34] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat I think I saw that if you take the shot JUST as the crosshair fully settles it's 100% crit chance
[1:22:34] <FirearmsInstructor> Woolie's "nope" to the west office licker was priceless.
[1:22:35] <Dragovus> Why has Woolie blighted Pat like this?

[1:23:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm waiting for the Crazy Talk
[1:23:19] <copyritetm> i played and beat this game on hardcore. on top of this also being my first survival horror game period. after beating that shit and trying out standard, i felt like i took off my wieghted clothing because everything in this game gets its ass kicked
[1:23:19] <%AdmiralButtloaf> slash dat ass
[1:23:20] <%HellHunter120> They just have a gluttonous need for your bullets
[1:23:20] <+nairb136> Stab her
[1:23:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat These zombies have buffed HP and stagger "differently". I've noticed handguns take abnormally more ammo to handle them. Shotty is best.

[1:29:14] <CorvoBrooks> oh dang
[1:29:14] <%Laecerelius> Asserting his dominance by clipping into you
[1:29:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow I didn't know you can get damaged from being clotheslined like that
[1:29:16] <AC9_Nineball> X Gonna Clip It Through Ya
[1:29:17] <+G_Thunders> Wtf I’ve NEVER gotten him to do that even when I’ve tried
[1:29:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Can we get a shitty PS1 Mr. X?
[1:29:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Safest bet is back into club room. Hall is tight, AND the bench fucks you up there bigtime.
[1:29:18] <+Sxy_T_Rex> the ol' crawl through the legs trick
[1:29:20] <copyritetm> aim down sights can trigger his punch whenever you want him to
[1:29:21] <pede2011> @AngriestPat you should have installed the DMX mod
[1:29:21] <Valdorick> At least his push back doesn't do 99% of your health.
[1:29:24] <Dakuu75> i've NEVER seen him break that wall
[1:29:24] <crusader_heide> Juke thru Window!
[1:29:25] <%lewdskeletor13> You phased through him LUL
[1:29:26] <+dirtyh4rr1> Good thing you didn't knock his fedora off
[1:29:30] <TranquilTurnip> So was someone made into Mr. X?
[1:29:33] <Kaitepaints> Those boot tho
[1:29:34] <roboguy2k> is this Leon A or B?
[1:29:35] <%Elky3> rooVV hug Mr X
[1:29:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Where's all of Pat's confidence and power?

[1:29:38] <%DatGuyJimbo> SAVE
[1:29:39] <%terminallyCapriciousz> leon A
[1:29:42] <%Laecerelius> DONGLER!
[1:29:43] <McAngrimStein> @ThatGuyfromMars On hardcore it drops you to caution, but when 90% of hits knock you to danger, it shows that move is weak
[1:29:45] <Dragovus> T pose to assert dominance
[1:29:48] <Fujiwara_92> heal and save
[1:29:49] <%zerocruz> X has only destroyed that wall for me once
[1:29:50] <%SrG00SE> I have some violent diarrhea tonight, thanks for keeping me company on the pooper Pat and chat
[1:30:02] <%SmoochSpider> Leon A and Cliffy B

[1:30:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SrG00SE We glad we can help with your shitposting
[1:30:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did he just tell Mr. X to stop running after him?
[1:30:14] <Dakuu75> @Dragovus Turn your favial animations up to 500% to envoke fear
[1:30:14] <+Awestonio> You can just go back in the room when he crushes the wall. He wont come in
[1:30:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you can use the breakable floor to quick-juke him, but aggro butt zombie.
[1:30:17] <+nairb136> SmoochSpider LUL
[1:30:18] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> “Wow, he’s fast!” -sanic

[1:30:40] <%SrG00SE> I'm shitposting while shitposting, yay
[1:30:41] <Shadicara> I don't think you lost him pat
[1:30:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @danknugglit 30 men died making that trenchcoat.
[1:30:41] <Teiwaz12> I'm late to the party, but why are you using the classic costume and not the original OST?
[1:30:45] <pede2011> OH LAWD HE COMIN
[1:30:46] <KaptainKappathe5th> SAFE
[1:30:47] <%GohanEgret> @SrG00SE sounds like you got a case of the cliffy's
[1:30:47] <crusader_heide> Can you sneak up behind Marvin and blow his head off before he stands up now?
[1:30:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> SAFE

[1:30:58] <iamnotaparrot> he teleports to you when you grab the tool for the library shelves
[1:30:59] <McAngrimStein> @danknugglit Umbrella brand Big N' Tall selection
[1:31:01] <Valdorick> File - "We had 3 buff south American looking men not wearing much come to the station today. They said they wanted to check our red stone. We told them the puzzles to go through seeing it, and they turned away and said it wasn't worth their time. Man, the people these day, huh?"
[1:31:05] <pede2011> y no DMX mod?
[1:31:08] <danknugglit> LUL only 30?
[1:31:12] <Guardiansaiyan> @Teiwaz12 it was free and he did new classic..old music...and now he is doing hardcore with classic 1998 look
[1:31:15] <crusader_heide> copyright
[1:31:18] <%Das_Bass> that pc case looks so 2000s
[1:31:19] <%zerocruz> Do B.O.W’s have dicks ?
[1:31:20] <PSI_Guy95> So in the game of Pat vs Cliffy B, is Pat Mr. X or is he Leon
[1:31:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Copyright
[1:31:23] <%mayorrev> do sounds get X's attention?
[1:31:24] <%SrG00SE> @gohanegret apatBIG cliffy b's
[1:31:25] <ZephynM> It's amazing how much you have to do to gain access to an armory.
[1:31:29] <tank7013> @danknugglit Umbrella made this model for covert operations. Because apparently they thought a trench coat and hat were enough
[1:31:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lightning Hawk?
[1:31:34] <KaptainKappathe5th> @zerocruz tyrant clones dont
[1:31:34] <@SSaryn> So can we all agree Lighting Hawk is the coolest.
[1:31:35] <+dirtyh4rr1> healing spray
[1:31:35] <Shadicara> I like how that's the one room he can't get in. Augh desk work my one weakness

[1:31:41] <ZephynM> @doc_ock_rokc It's a magnum donger
[1:31:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Mod idea: replace the sounds of Mr. X's footsteps with DMX.
[1:31:42] <WaxWitch> xcalThinking
[1:31:44] <conflict1914> x is bout to give it
[1:31:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Safe now. He's above.
[1:31:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SSaryn it is when it's fully upgraded
[1:31:46] <GameXful2> holy shit calm down X
[1:31:47] <McAngrimStein> Mr. X is basically a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle with his outfit
[1:31:49] <danknugglit> L o r e
[1:31:52] <Kaitepaints> When I see game developers act like complete children all it does is make me think “Wow, I can do what you do so much better”
[1:31:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Will come out of library.
[1:31:54] <Guardiansaiyan> Power walking'
[1:31:54] <%ElenaManetta> His stomps are so cool
[1:31:55] <Shadicara> Please kick the door in
[1:31:57] <Dakuu75> @mayorrev to a degree. he'll for sure find you faster if you fire a gun
[1:32:08] <pede2011> One day they are gonna release and update that makes it so Mr X can enter any room, and they wont tell anyone
[1:32:08] <$Tuskor13> where is he monkaS
[1:32:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's a lot of blood in that hallway.
[1:32:11] <natebud> @ShichiNoBushi what what WHAT WHAT
[1:32:12] <+Shotgundam009> Mr X working hard out here
[1:32:14] <dekkitout> Listen to the woman, X. Calm down. Just calm down!

[1:32:17] <%RascheTheRabbit> Goodnight all, I work in the AM. <3 Enjoy!
[1:32:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tank7013 To be fair if a huge guy and a Trench coat and hat was around you wouldn't want to pay attention to them
[1:32:24] <GameXful2> please open the door X
[1:32:26] <$Tuskor13> @pede2011 no they should add in new walls for him to break
[1:32:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you need to go WEST hall to get jack
[1:32:26] <natebud> Porbably left the film @AngriestPat
[1:32:28] <@SSaryn> @ThatGuyfromMars So we can both agree we can't pin it against the Broken Butterfly because the Broken Butterfly is the biggest power gap in Revolvers/Magnums.
[1:32:28] <%lewdskeletor13> @raschetherabbit Night! apatDab
[1:32:29] <deviljhojho94> how mysterious tomatoDevious

[1:32:39] <Kaitepaints> I’m big scared
[1:32:40] <GameXful2> a
[1:32:43] <%ElenaManetta> I wonder how much review those footsteps took during game dev. If that was like. "We spent 5 months perfecting it at every volume and every filter"
[1:32:45] <Fujiwara_92> hoho
[1:32:47] <Shadicara> Cmon X don't let me down

[1:33:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ElenaManetta Probably as much time perfecting the return arc of the Axe in God of War.
[1:33:04] <Kaitepaints> @elenamanetta more like three
[1:33:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SSaryn all I know is that the lightning hawk is the most ridiculous looking gun with that upgraded barrel and it's also the coolest
[1:33:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiryu could beat X
[1:33:09] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Need a mod that let's X RKO people
[1:33:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Use pillars for cover, he as 20/20 woolie vision, but NOT x-ray
[1:33:18] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc I'd wanna pay just enough attention to know I'm walking the other way
[1:33:21] <GameXful2> don't trigger marvin
[1:33:22] <%Niney_Who> Kiryu could definitely beat Mr. X
[1:33:23] <+GradedBinkie> knock knock open up the door it's real
[1:33:26] <Dakuu75> club and heart keys are needed for the library's jack-tool, right?

[1:33:27] <@SSaryn> @ThatGuyfromMars It sure fucking is.

[1:33:36] <Shadicara> Nah a mod where Mr X starts running at you and spears you

[1:37:10] <%CreakySkelly> it's not that bad, it's how I started it, I think with a keyboard and mouse it's fine
[1:37:11] <%connos_livereview> its actually not once youve done it the first time
[1:37:12] <+xx123manxx> well, assuming you don't know all the strats it's difficult
[1:37:12] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc But the army doesn't know half of what they're doing and none of their connections were enough to stop them from dying after Raccoon City
[1:37:13] <+InstiGaitan> Hardcore was ez just dont get hit
[1:37:15] <%mayorrev> I love these gears more than cliff loves his gears
[1:37:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Once you have fuse, BOOK it through west storage room. You took out the non-hat cop, so you can go STRAIGHT through, but the other one will be nibbling your gibblets if you delay.
[1:37:18] <%ElenaManetta> i thought dsp did that
[1:37:19] <crusader_heide> LobosJR did too
[1:37:20] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Max also losing his shit in the process LOL
[1:37:23] <%zerocruz> apatBig DANGER WATCHYOUSELF
[1:37:25] <%Bjornbergmann> Well never touching Hardcore then if you say so @AngriestPat
[1:37:26] <+qwazzeon> It's harder but not super difficult. You just have to be more cautious with enemies because they take more hits and you take less.
[1:37:28] <McAngrimStein> Lobos is actually good at games though

[1:37:51] <CwutGaming> shotoWut shotoWut shotoWut
[1:37:52] <+G_Thunders> Lol “it’s not hard once you know exactly how to play it” yeah same as everything else.
[1:37:56] <natebud> That's why you always stay at caution. Still go to danger if your bit, but you didn't waste a green herb healing to full.
[1:37:56] <GameXful2> whut
[1:37:56] <%ECRead> evening gentlemen. and gentleladies.
[1:37:58] <Sloavon> how????
[1:37:58] <McAngrimStein> @Jeikujeiku Sherry, the part that's the same regardless of difficulty
[1:37:59] <Djinnazz> lol, no she's not.
[1:38:01] <%snow_bush> Ha ha! Everyone I know is dead!
[1:38:01] <+Gooniekorn> but its the easiest

[1:38:07] <%mzrx7> lolwut
[1:38:08] <$DK_Rance> sherrys part is not hard at all lol
[1:38:09] <Bloogoose> I literally haven't failed once on Sherry's section
[1:38:09] <Fujiwara_92> she's easy tho
[1:38:09] <Shadicara> Mr X needs to write reports daily shut your mouth Leon
[1:38:12] <marvel877> of the original game? yeah
[1:38:12] <GameXful2> how ? she's basically a scripted section

[1:38:16] <Skatedeandre> Did you also not see the typewriter there?
[1:38:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tank7013 they were more then aware and they used Umbrella as plausible deniability
[1:38:23] <CastellanVon> Superbunnyhop didn't know there was a save point in Sherry's section and he was playing hardcore mode on his first run
[1:38:24] <+Juan_Pequeno> G3 is the hardest part of the game
[1:38:24] <echodrone81> oh eat a dick moobot. 500 second ban for caps lock
[1:38:26] <Sloavon> ada with her dumb magic science gun was the hardest part
[1:38:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Stop by safe room, SAVE, and have at least 2 sub-weapons (knife & FB) for jail escape.

[1:38:38] <%zerocruz> Time to unsub from superbunnyhop again
[1:38:39] <iamnotaparrot> Ada's is 10x harder than Sherry's
[1:38:39] <Valdorick> Don't taunt the zombies, Pat, that's how crazy talk gets you.
[1:38:39] <natebud> Hardest part is the goo hallway
[1:38:40] <+InstiGaitan> @G_Thunders nah Sherry has like a super definitive path that's not at all hard to learn
[1:38:51] <%SrG00SE> can we rename moobot to cliffyB
[1:38:51] <+8framelag> G2 is the hardest feels like rng between swings and grab
[1:38:54] <%SmoochSpider> @AngriestPat Will you be doing a Cliffy B run after this Kappa
[1:38:56] <%PixellPunk> Sherry's part was super easy for me.
[1:38:56] <GameXful2> you just have to wait in sherry's section lmao
[1:38:58] <%Pappajimbo> sherrys hard if you have no stelth skill like pat

[1:39:02] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc They sure as hell didn't know Spencer was going for world domination
[1:39:02] <+xx123manxx> Hardest part of the game is the G goo hallway
[1:39:10] <%zerocruz> Moobot you bitch
[1:39:12] <+Jeikujeiku> I think the only reason people fail sherry is because its simpler than it appears
[1:39:13] <Mr_Taters > @CastellanVon Same thing happened to me, that was rough, was too distracted with worrying about irons and missed the typewriter

[1:39:27] <Kaitepaints> Can someone explain the Bunnyhop hate? I’ve never watched or heard anything about them except from Superbestfriends
[1:39:28] <KaptainKappathe5th> RUINED
[1:39:28] <%SergeantSov> To my knowledge, Moobot still isn't a corncob
[1:39:29] <An_Armed_Bear> This is my first time really seeing this game and I'M feeling tense whenever I hear the stomps
[1:39:29] <pede2011> @AngriestPat will you try the first person mod?
[1:39:29] <+G_Thunders> @instigaitan oh I was referring to Hardcore in general. Yeah Sherry’s section is easy no matter what
[1:39:33] <+GradedBinkie> Good news, dmx is NOT in jail
[1:39:37] <%DatGuyJimbo> someone make a cliffyB mr X mod

[1:39:51] <+8framelag> g sewer is fine just carry grenades/flamerounds to stun
[1:39:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Kaitepaints I don't think there is hate, the unsub from superbunnyhop I think is a joke from the podcast
[1:39:56] <CorvoBrooks> bring a flash
[1:39:56] <Skatedeandre> No that would enlarge his ego more
[1:39:59] <kakorot96> kill the idiots

[1:40:01] <Gruhunchously> @Kaitepaints It's mostly a meme.
[1:40:01] <CastellanVon> We don't hate superbunnyhop. It's just a meme to unsubscribe from him for something completely unrelated

[1:41:40] <+xx123manxx> @iamnotaparrot as far as normal gameplay goes, the room is not that bad, but when it comes to speedrunning the game, that room can be a real run killer
[1:41:43] <%HellHunter120> First try
[1:41:44] <%mayorrev> there's an award for getting it in 3?

[1:42:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kaitepaints There was technical difficulties before a podcast and someone, I think Woolie, made the mistake of reading the chat aloud. "This podcast is terrible, I'm unsubbing from SuperBunnyHop." Or something along those lines. As if it was George's fault.
[1:42:38] <McAngrimStein> @GarbageNirvana Me too, I totally missed the switch, but I used a flash to get by and never saw X
[1:42:39] <DraxTD> hi

[1:43:16] <%SrG00SE> he does leave it on the desk
[1:43:17] <thetruenicster> Its a shame that Ada and Sherry aren't also 8 bit
[1:43:18] <rekinom> For anyone who doesn't have it, Fallout: New Vegas + all DLCs is $10 atm
[1:43:18] <NoirePanzer> GET AWAY FROM HER LEON
[1:43:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why isn't Ada in her polygon mode
[1:43:19] <%ElenaManetta> It's actually game of the year, babe
[1:43:19] <%Ahack13> He does. He always loses the hat.
[1:43:19] <reonome> leon looks really stonefaced here Kappa
[1:43:20] <%Laecerelius> Bitch, I'm 16 bit!
[1:43:20] <+RC_S3kshun8> Ada is Love
[1:43:20] <Shadicara> Ada was the solution to Mr Shakedown all along
[1:43:20] <%foreverN2dust> I can't wait to see this leon skin kiss Ada
[1:43:21] <CorvoBrooks> I feel like I have seen him have his hat here
[1:43:21] <PSI_Guy95> This isn't a game, low poly model of Leon!!!
[1:43:22] <+Stereotreme> hahahaha she's so done
[1:43:22] <FutaSnek> I love that libe
[1:43:23] <%SergeantSov> Look at Leon again Ada and tell me that again
[1:43:23] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat so was Max brave or insane for doing hardcore first without playing the game beforehand
[1:43:24] <%mayorrev> look at leon's sexy squares
[1:43:24] <%yeknomlive> ada look at him. it's clearly a game
[1:43:24] <+Stereotreme> I love her
[1:43:25] <The_Sorrow_> Ada wait!
[1:43:26] <Sloavon> Leon is a cute good boy
[1:43:26] <NoirePanzer> THE BLOODLINE
[1:43:27] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat what kind of backwater bumpkin is Leon that he actually BELIEVES ada is a secret agent
[1:43:27] <disister1201> You should put on the beach mr.x mod
[1:43:30] <Valdorick> "This isn't a game!" she says to 64 bit man
[1:43:33] <Geno4344> You should be able to steal Mr. X's hat
[1:43:34] <ngb1423> X status: gaven to
[1:43:35] <+MrTurtleThief> Could've killed them both LUL
[1:43:36] <%Kiyosuki> or does she turn into 1998 ada when she takes the coat off?
[1:43:36] <%lewdskeletor13> ADA WAIT
[1:43:37] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc And I'm saying that would have happened anyway if Umbrella started using their Tyrants for non-sanctioned assassinations
[1:43:37] <KaptainKappathe5th> OH GOD KENDO
[1:43:39] <Gruhunchously> @Kaitepaints Also, they starting making up random terrible things that Super Bunnyhop was responsible for, and one of them was him doing blackface. Then that became a running gag as well.
[1:43:42] <+DAIROCKETTO> ada work with me here i don't actually have seperated fingers
[1:43:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> Low poly Leon is best Leon
[1:43:45] <Enryuan> The fact that she had explosive ready with her inside the car is crazy
[1:43:46] <NoirePanzer> THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE
[1:43:48] <gunzerkingdunce> Leon put your low poly dick in Claire's low poly cooch
[1:43:50] <natebud> Can't wait for the dramatic kiss with polygonal Leon
[1:43:50] <%Trabnaxes> I an seriously confused as to why Ada kills Mr. X here. Aren't they on the same team?
[1:43:51] <antthefool> Imagine if he came out from the inside
[1:43:51] <%GohanEgret> ada kissing this leon is going to be great
[1:43:52] <dreu81> Oh man just wait till they kiss
[1:43:53] <danknugglit> Leons lip sync is on point
[1:43:54] <Mr_Taters > @Kiyosuki That would be amazing
[1:43:56] <An_Armed_Bear> Ada why do you need sunglasses indoors
[1:43:56] <echodrone81> so how does birkin impregnate Sherry? and how is she just fine afterwards?
[1:43:58] <SnaKemuho> why isn't she pixelated if she's playable
[1:43:59] <Erimos> Screams in Redfield LUL
[1:44:00] <ScreamingMeat> Leon's loosing polygons as we speak
[1:44:01] <Kaitepaints> Wow ok... these jokes sometimes are so convoluted @gruhunchously
[1:44:01] <Yrefe> you can just FEEL the moist
[1:44:01] <reonome> LUL
[1:44:02] <iamnotaparrot> god I miss the blackface boyz
[1:44:02] <%Kiyosuki> No Ada doesnt work for Umbrella
[1:44:03] <%jacktheripper218> look at his fucking ass
[1:44:03] <FirearmsInstructor> Kendo's hands are fucked in the cutscene, like burnt to hell, but not in Ghost Survivors?
[1:44:03] <%Laecerelius> Ada, can you spare some polys?
[1:44:04] <KaptainKappathe5th> leon in the kendo scene is gonna be so fucking good
[1:44:04] <%zerocruz> Wait for when they make out LUL
[1:44:04] <Dakuu75> Kendo, the most baller ghost survivor
[1:44:04] <+GradedBinkie> Free dlc mr x costume for Leon
[1:44:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Trabnaxes gotta keep the cover going
[1:44:06] <WaxWitch> She's such a bitch, i love her
[1:44:06] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> theres more polygons in ada's face than in Leon's entire body
[1:44:09] <+TransporterX7> Ada is too strong for an OG RE2 model
[1:44:10] <%lewdskeletor13> @trabnaxes No she’s working for Wesker
[1:44:13] <%Kiyosuki> She works for a rival organization
[1:44:15] <%Taisuru> Leon "Meat Hooks" Kennedy
[1:44:15] <Shadicara> Ada get your stripper coat off Kappa
[1:44:17] <crusader_heide> why is no one talking about how big this police car is
[1:44:17] <TurboMuffin89> idk why but that skin triggers me so hard LUL
[1:44:19] <CorvoBrooks> Ada wait
[1:44:19] <Skatedeandre> Leon your face is looking a little...stiff
[1:44:19] <CastellanVon> Remember when "Superbunnyhop Blackface" was the number one result when you googled superbunnyhop?
[1:44:20] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Dat rectangular dick
[1:44:20] <%Plague_Nurse> @echodrone81 it just works
[1:44:21] <grayjammer> Don't have F1NG3RS?
[1:44:27] <natebud> Ada does hurry
[1:44:27] <Sloavon> he shoves an alien worm down her throat and then she takes an antidote that gives her super powers
[1:44:28] <%Laecerelius> Leon's meaty manimal paws
[1:44:30] <+xx123manxx> Ada has 200 graphics, Leon only has 14 graphics
[1:44:31] <%AdmiralButtloaf> theres more polygons in her lips
[1:44:32] <aimlesshealer> I love details like that
[1:44:38] <%HellHunter120> Thank goodness for that
[1:44:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tank7013 But prior to raccoon they had sanctions
[1:44:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat She does. If you hit the white car before she hits the top of the ramp, she "speeds up"
[1:44:44] <Erimos> Speedrunner friendly.
[1:44:44] <Megakid51> Have you gotten an S+ rank on hardcore yet?
[1:44:45] <%Trabnaxes> Thanks for the clarification Team! I guess I thought Wesker controlled Umbrella
[1:44:45] <danknugglit> LEON WAIT
[1:44:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow she hauled ass
[1:44:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> Leon is like a Powerpuff Girl, his hands just kind of...work
[1:44:49] <%foreverN2dust> yum
[1:44:49] <%GohanEgret> pizza pasta
[1:44:51] <TheJustGordo> Do you think Ada's shoes have more polygons than Leon's whole body?
[1:44:52] <%HellHunter120> Imagine going for S+ and waiting for her to finish her stuff
[1:44:53] <%TombstoneTTromboners> hey leon, get me a perogi
[1:44:53] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> making a woman run in high heels smh so disrespectful
[1:44:53] <garbageheaphound> time for tears
[1:44:55] <rekinom> God I want pierogies now
[1:44:55] <%Laecerelius> Pat hasn't beaten the game on hardcore yet
[1:44:56] <ArtThouBored> LEONWAIT
[1:44:57] <CastellanVon> Ada probably has like millions of polygons, Leon has like 100
[1:44:57] <echodrone81> perogies are fucking delicious
[1:44:57] <Gruhunchously> @Kaitepaints It's what happens when a buch of friends of scewing around. Jokes start layering on jokes and it becomes a continuity that's hard to understand if you weren't there at the time.
[1:45:02] <crusader_heide> Jill Sandwhich BArry Barry Barry
[1:45:03] <%shockzndrawe> GOD that model looks so uncanny in this engine
[1:45:03] <SubjectX07x> Wait, that said Russian, aren't Perogies polish?

[1:45:04] <lloyddboy> KENDO AGAINDO
[1:45:05] <%Taisuru> Pat what's living in Raccoon City feel like?
[1:45:07] <+TransporterX7> Like it makes no sense
[1:45:07] <Shadicara> Shoot the child pat Kappa
[1:45:08] <Kaitepaints> I was genuinely like “wow, this guy must be an asshole I better stay away from his content”
[1:45:08] <%SrG00SE> I was introduced to Ada when I was 8 yrs old. I've had a short haired Asian girl fetish my whole life, literally not coincidence

[1:45:28] <danknugglit> :(
[1:45:29] <disister1201> wtf is a perogie?
[1:45:30] <Mr_Taters > @echodrone81 It's never really clear and that's probably for the best, the reason she survives longer is because she's a blood relative I believe.
[1:45:33] <%GohanEgret> kenbro BibleThump

[1:52:12] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I like to imagine that this alligator wasn't actually affected by G or T, it's just a huge alligator that happened to get that big because people in raccoon city litter a bunch
[1:52:12] <+8framelag> ada takes her time

[1:55:48] <%CorvoBrooks> looks like the real thing!
[1:55:48] <+GradedBinkie> Can you shoot him?
[1:55:48] <Valdorick> C-can you shoot him?

[1:55:59] <Acidshocker> Cool, thanks
[1:56:03] <aiyobro> it's the best most unskippable part of the game
[1:56:06] <+TonberryCrunch> like beach boy mr x
[1:56:07] <ryujinran> did chris replace the real leon with a doll so ada wouldn't notice?
[1:56:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat They pull the camera out further in Ada's section so you can see her ass and legs better.
[1:56:11] <tri3dgE027> I thought the recent patch broke the mods?
[1:56:11] <+BorinCorran> Everytime I hear Ada say "it's secret weapon time, I laugh. It's so dorky.
[1:56:12] <SkyPirateArcane> Speedo Mr. X is amazing
[1:56:12] <lloyddboy> Mr seXy mod
[1:56:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Tuskor13 I bet you pixelated, polygon real dolls are fucking thing. I bet you.
[1:56:18] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> what if the reason chris thinks no one but leon will fuck claire is because claire is just as polygonal as leon is and their geometry meshes well
[1:56:22] <+xx123manxx> As far as modding goes, even texture mods are fairly complex to do
[1:56:25] <danknugglit> "ADA WAIT" every line mod when
[1:56:28] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat You should do a playthrough with a bunch of mods installed. Silly or serious, up to you.
[1:56:28] <Gruhunchously> @ryujinran He needs the real Leon to continue his bloodline.
[1:56:31] <%connos_livereview> hope theres a mod that remove these FUCKN sections
[1:56:38] <Valdorick> Bugs, in my game? Its more likely than you think.
[1:56:39] <%ECRead> buggos dont care
[1:56:41] <%Prism_Wing> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug that's lore
[1:56:55] <Skatedeandre> See it?
[1:56:57] <KeiPrime> did he already do the no gun thing with ada?
[1:56:59] <echodrone81> this area is dark Bullshit

[1:57:06] <+CrowGuy> Pat you are playing Apex Legends on ps4 right?
[1:57:07] <An_Armed_Bear> Go back to Anthem, buggos
[1:57:09] <KaptainKappathe5th> do you ever get the ammo from ada as leon?
[1:57:11] <%ooblagis> Yes

[1:57:28] <+KNYGHT87> ehvAda
[1:57:29] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Prism_Wing Leon wants ada so much because she's the only woman who's accepted him for what he truly is: a low-poly PS1 model in a current gen game. it all makes sense now!
[1:57:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> it isn't even a person any more

[2:00:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat They're gearboxes for hydraulic pumps for the door. "Breaking them" wouldn't open the door... but vidjaghamez!!
[2:00:32] <Valdorick> How this will work in AGDQ - you won't see anything but the character model, and maybe some loaded in assets, as they go out of bounds.
[2:00:44] <tank7013> @FearTheWorm Oh sure Steve's the worst. But MAN do I hate Annette
[2:00:44] <ZephynM> Magnetic locks maybe?
[2:00:46] <natebud> 1998 technology was basically magic
[2:00:48] <Valdorick> I mean, I'm guessing anyway.

[2:02:23] <ZephynM> Wow, herbs for days
[2:02:23] <%Laecerelius> Jump in that poop, Pat!
[2:02:26] <Sloavon> i usually make though the whole game without using majority of the gunpowders
[2:02:28] <An_Armed_Bear> Leon you have so many herbs can I have one
[2:02:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Knife gone from jail zombie. Just a reminder.
[2:02:29] <tank7013> Aaaaand now for the least fun part of the game. All because of one enemy type
[2:02:36] <echodrone81> look at the poo on the walls!!
[2:02:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rytyoung The cookies from Tadrer Joe's? I love those Kappa
[2:02:43] <FearTheWorm> No low-poly weapons tho?

[2:02:45] <%CorvoBrooks> Elmo poo
[2:02:47] <%SrG00SE> is bluhd
[2:02:47] <misterbackdown> What a wonderful smell you've discovered
[2:02:47] <Skatedeandre> Who flushed bullets down the toilet?
[2:02:48] <%connos_livereview> and then leon got sepsis and died the end
[2:02:52] <Sloavon> one enemy type?
[2:02:53] <+AttentionPelican> No bandage for this costume? 2/10
[2:02:53] <%Laecerelius> Smear that shit all over to keep the zombies from smelling ya!
[2:02:55] <Shadicara> poo demons
[2:02:57] <+x24sonic> i really wish they had done low poly weapons
[2:02:59] <Ion_LaserX> @Skatedeandre probably Irons
[2:03:01] <Sloavon> the Gs are cool
[2:03:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can we get a DLC pack where they recast Leon? He's the only really noticeable garbage performance.
[2:03:03] <Gruhunchously> @zerocruz That's what they're there for.
[2:03:04] <ManfredA> @Sloavon he prolly means G Adults
[2:03:04] <+nairb136> I believe in Pat
[2:03:05] <%Prism_Wing> @sphincter_spelunker Traitor Joes
[2:03:08] <echodrone81> Leon has hepatitis now
[2:03:13] <natebud> Just because you dont want to shoot the gun Pat.
[2:03:15] <Skatedeandre> @ion_laserx LUL
[2:03:16] <danknugglit> G juke PogChamp
[2:03:17] <+GradedBinkie> Smear the poo water on you like Arnold in Predator
[2:03:18] <aiyobro> the G's are awful i don't even kill them
[2:03:20] <Djinnazz> G Jukin is easy, just back up.
[2:03:20] <+8framelag> you'lll never get your hands on the D
[2:03:21] <+dirtyh4rr1> and the mini Gs
[2:03:22] <Valdorick> Gukes
[2:03:23] <%connos_livereview> FEEEL THE GEEEEEEz
[2:03:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> lol thats eeasy
[2:03:25] <+xx123manxx> you only have to juke 3 G's depending on your route
[2:03:28] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Juke them Gs
[2:03:28] <Gruhunchously> I remember this one guy in particular.
[2:03:31] <%CorvoBrooks> use grenages on the Gs
[2:03:38] <tank7013> @Sloavon I hate fighting them so much. It's the grab. They can just chain it if the RNG decides to screw you
[2:03:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Shooting them in the face (end of LONG neck) CAN stagger them, but vomit animation / "weak" side runby is ideal, space permitted.
[2:03:57] <$rytyoung> @sphincter_spelunker UK doesn't have trader Joe's sadly, or any product named JoJo's BibleThump
[2:04:02] <+8framelag> grenade and running to the right of them
[2:04:04] <+x24sonic> the G's are really not that bad, with claire they take 1 flame and 2 or 3 acid rounds, and with leon they can definitely eat up some magnum & shotgun ammo but if you stay calm and are precise with your shooting they go down pretty easy
[2:04:05] <%rdark_ksu> i feel like a sword is becoming a more and more worthy answer here
[2:04:08] <mutmc> BibleThump
[2:04:09] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Go across and down. Come back here later.
[2:04:14] <+GradedBinkie> REKT
[2:04:19] <Ner234> SPLAT
[2:04:19] <tank7013> @Sloavon That and the fact that if you don't have flame rounds then goodbye to half your bullets
[2:04:21] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat You should download the Beachboy X mod
[2:04:21] <+nairb136> That's always so great
[2:04:23] <Gruhunchously> He was just a regular guy taking a nap, Pat.
[2:04:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Give them the emprorors Peace
[2:04:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> That Hand Block tech was powerful.
[2:04:41] <SubjectX07x> This dude stiff arming BULLETS.
[2:04:41] <%connos_livereview> randomizer for this is gonna be lit kind of amazed they didnt just do that instead of roast survivors instead tbh

[2:11:58] <ManfredA> it doesn't matter Pure, that zombie is a trick one that only gets up when you attack it
[2:12:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everyone, everyone, Pat's clearly missing on purpose so he can get those crits on the headshots. He's definitely not that bad of a shot for real guys, trust me. Kappa Kappa

[2:12:01] <%CorvoBrooks> I dont think so
[2:12:03] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> you call the zombie an idiot, but you forget the t bar @angriestpat

[2:13:25] <majindusto> I Never played the outbreak games BibleThump
[2:13:28] <Sloavon> why does everyone love outbreak? heard it wasn't that great from someone
[2:13:29] <+nairb136> How limited is the inventory?
[2:13:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's no joke. Try speedrunning with only 1 pack
[2:13:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @aiyobro We already have undead cats that is why they have 9 lives
[2:13:36] <%HellHunter120> S is 2.5 on hardcore
[2:13:38] <+Maids4lyfe> I just wish Leon could actually run
[2:13:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @kauze12 2:30 on Hard
[2:13:41] <%CorvoBrooks> 6 less
[2:13:42] <StrangeCoincidence> I hope they remake the outbreak games and Code Veronica before they remake 3
[2:13:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> fucking hell
[2:13:44] <%Plague_Nurse> Outbreak has a great concept, but the games were fucking shit
[2:13:45] <+xx123manxx> it's not great solo @Sloavon
[2:13:46] <ManfredA> Outbreak is amazing; it's also ballbustingly hard and not very good solo
[2:13:52] <jossahmol> it probably is
[2:13:53] <ManfredA> with netplay it's very good
[2:13:55] <gustavozxd> I've been playing outbreak for the first time last week and it's awesome, even alone I'm having fun with the stupid AI
[2:13:56] <+xx123manxx> speedrunning you only get 1 pack LUL
[2:14:01] <shotgang86> Hey chat, should I play with Keyboard + mouse or with gamepad?
[2:14:02] <+G_Thunders> Outbreak’s biggest problem was the 45 second load times, but it was great as a survival horror game
[2:14:02] <%CorvoBrooks> What he has now is all he is going to get
[2:14:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no

[2:14:17] <%GianniVoices> sent you a powerful meme on twitter pat. so look forward to that
[2:14:17] <Djinnazz> Honestly, the hardest part is the beginging, this part on are pretty easy.
[2:14:18] <tadaosmad> Lost babby growl
[2:14:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, you should get an extra mic just for elmo and leave it near him at all times when he's on the couch.
[2:14:20] <Erimos> I'm down for Outbreak after RE3make. They can reuse assets from 2 and 3. I wouldn't mind.
[2:14:22] <%mercado94> ELMO
[2:14:22] <$Tuskor13> @AngriestPat whatever happened to that baby you kept on the shelf
[2:14:23] <doctorferdinand> acute little babie
[2:14:23] <%SrG00SE> recreate it, we missed it
[2:14:25] <Valdorick> But lets be honest here, I'm sure the T-virus is like the infested from Warframe. Cat's aren't just immune, they eat that shit like its bitch food. Because it is.
[2:14:26] <+GradedBinkie> If only he was micced up
[2:14:29] <tank7013> @Sloavon I'm tryin' but it isn't going so well. As Leon anyway. I wish his primary strength was more than just killing the two enemy types that never give me trouble
[2:14:33] <%SrG00SE> im sure youre a cute babby 2 patsypoo
[2:14:33] <%CorvoBrooks> but it on a collar
[2:14:34] <+C24U> Outbreak would have been fine if you had just 2 more item slots instead of only 4 total. 4 item slots in a RE game is worst idea ever
[2:14:37] <dragonwarrior000> Did an S+ with one pack and it's rough
[2:14:43] <californaya> just get a lapel mic for Elmo
[2:14:44] <MaxonMashville> this part is the worst

[2:14:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat flamethrower, ammo, green, red, blue
[2:15:00] <Renuarb> Careful Pat. Don't get IMPREGNATED
[2:15:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Clip a wireless mic to him sometime so we can always here him.
[2:15:00] <natebud> I think you need more bullets
[2:15:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> you might wanna bring a blue herb with you
[2:15:03] <ManfredA> 4 item slots is because you have up to 4 other people, all of you having 6 slots with one potentially having 8 is too many
[2:15:04] <shotgang86> no Pat, say to us exactely what Elmo said to you
[2:15:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh well
[2:15:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat 2 plugs, need 5 spaces for all
[2:15:08] <Djinnazz> need 7

[2:16:53] <aiyobro> i would hold onto a lighter with jill
[2:16:54] <+xx123manxx> I think if you shoot the G creatues from afar you can tricvk them into doing the spit move/swing so you can slip by but don't quote me on that if you die super hard @AngriestPat
[2:16:54] <%nitsuji94> speedrun ruiner
[2:16:57] <ManfredA> @gustavozxd not only can you emulate a HDD to improve load times but there's a functioning private server for netplay for both file 1 and 2

[2:17:10] <Sloavon> @tank7013 yeah, going from claire to leon felt pretty awkward since leon was destroying enemies that claire had more trouble with and then having trouble with enemies that claire easily dealt with
[2:17:13] <+GradedBinkie> T bar, don't forget it
[2:17:25] <Erimos> @Josef_Stryker Keep the lighter while you clear out the enemies, then put it back and grab your loot
[2:17:27] <natebud> You might have to expend some ammo pat
[2:17:35] <KaptainKappathe5th> t virus? more like t bar
[2:17:41] <gustavozxd> @manfreda isn't the online server for the Japanese version though? I know there's a patch but I couldn't find an iso anywhere outside from Emuparadise and you know....

[2:20:27] <%Plague_Nurse> yea
[2:20:29] <tank7013> @Sloavon I actually really like that about this game, that the characters could handle the same encounters in different ways because of their weapons. Problem is I adapted to fighting zombies and dogs as Claire a lot better than I did fighting G adults and lickers as Leon (although the lickers aren't so much of an issue now)
[2:20:30] <Erimos> The Poo Virus
[2:20:32] <FearTheWorm> Doesn't Leon have an open wound right now? And he's swimming through sewage...
[2:20:32] <+cahv123> Sup pat? What's the goal today?
[2:20:34] <tadaosmad> Extra gooey.
[2:20:35] <%CorvoBrooks> Not on hardcore
[2:20:36] <TranquilTurnip> Pat I respect the fact that you've managed to play this game for what feels like a month straight, I feel like I get bored in most games after a few hours
[2:20:42] <KaptainKappathe5th> @cahv123 win
[2:20:44] <StrangeCoincidence> thats so sweet that he has a picture of Paige by him at all times
[2:20:58] <+x24sonic> AHSDFKLAHSDFASDFHJ LMAO
[2:20:59] <Good_Snacks> Thank you for BTFOing Cliffy B
[2:21:03] <CSeriesJTYPE> it looks like he's wearing a Leon mascot costume
[2:21:07] <+cahv123> Lol Fair.
[2:21:10] <tadaosmad> Oh SHIT! I ain't sleeping now.
[2:21:24] <ManfredA> Well Pat IS the biggest RE fanboy imaginable, I love his dedication
[2:21:28] <TranquilTurnip> LUL
[2:21:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:21:32] <PSI_Guy95> Pat has been playing RE2 for years in general
[2:21:34] <%ElenaManetta> I haven't done 7 runs of my favorite game ever.
[2:21:35] <CrimsonFox777> "Only"
[2:21:35] <%JJCheeker> Are those monster's Williams children
[2:21:37] <SundarkSoldier> Sup homies
[2:21:38] <garbageheaphound> "only"
[2:21:38] <dekkitout> Only the eleventy seventh run
[2:21:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's also a remake of his favorite game
[2:21:39] <Skullcrush04> ONLY his seventh
[2:21:39] <+x24sonic> look, this is only my 57th time playing the game, ok?
[2:21:40] <%skizzuto> ONLY the seventh?
[2:21:44] <SundarkSoldier> Is this Leon A or B
[2:21:45] <%Das_Bass> only 7? FAKE FAN
[2:21:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ONLY 7th
[2:21:45] <%ElenaManetta> The only game I've ever played for years on end was Team Fortress 2
[2:21:46] <+nairb136> only
[2:21:47] <%SrG00SE> yeah i have a short list of games that i can play this much
[2:21:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what a fake fan Kappa
[2:21:49] <TheyCallMeVawn> RE games are pretty much built to be replayed
[2:21:49] <%MaxwellKraft> pat is this your new favorite game of all time?
[2:21:51] <%mercado94> #FakeFan
[2:21:57] <%myrrdraal1515> Hyaaa
[2:21:57] <Gruhunchously> @JJCheeker Don't talk about Sherry like that...jeez/
[2:22:00] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 alright guys, I'll try to type as best i can in the cold. I have an update on what I'll hereto refer as "team chaotic dumbass" last time the fighter knocked out the pun wielding bard before they left the first bar. This time the warlock offered to spar with the bard, then the fighter offered to join. Then backed out. Then tried to suckerpunch the bard by poking him in the eyes so he couldn't cast. He missed, then punched the bard. Then the bard tried to stab him back. Then the warlock
[2:22:01] <ManfredA> @JJCheeker yeh, g-embryos implanted by G turn into G Adults, though embryos from G Adults do not
[2:22:04] <Marpolo13> I mean it helps when the game is your favorite
[2:22:05] <studleydoorite> @AngriestPat when you get to the room with the magnum parts, look at the hilariously tiny pallet jack in the corner
[2:22:06] <+C24U> I got my first platinum trophy from this game the other day
[2:22:08] <Erimos> We're happy for ya, Pat.
[2:22:08] <natebud> Are you going to use the magnum extension?
[2:22:09] <gustavozxd> @elenamanetta well what would be your favorite games? cause if it's something like a final fantasy game it's understandable
[2:22:09] <FearTheWorm> "Guys, this is only my 12th run of KoTOR2"
[2:22:09] <%laserbeaming> Do you think they'll ever add a classic mode?
[2:22:12] <%CorvoBrooks> to be fair it only takes a couple of hours to beat
[2:22:12] <SchroedingersFerret> The Jizz Festival
[2:22:15] <majindusto> Woolie is gonna "Love" the G Creatures when he finally gets to them! lol
[2:22:17] <Marpolo13> I could play my favorites for months at a time too
[2:22:21] <StrangeCoincidence> Is there any point to playing Claire A if I already did Leon A and Claire B?
[2:22:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat mag ammo on bucket. Don't forget on way back down.
[2:22:24] <%ElenaManetta> The most I've ever done of a single player game is maybe Paper Mario Thousand Year Door around 5 times since it originally came out.
[2:22:32] <%ShadyFlux> I couldn't bring myself to play this but I've been enjoying the hell out of your streams
[2:22:33] <%ooblagis> It's kind of tiny
[2:22:36] <KeiPrime> looks normal to me
[2:22:36] <+nairb136> hilarious
[2:22:37] <%rdark_ksu> it is narrow
[2:22:41] <+xx123manxx> it is pretty tiny
[2:22:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its pretty tiny
[2:22:42] <%CorvoBrooks> She has different weapons
[2:22:42] <+x24sonic> that is pretty small tbh
[2:22:42] <ThDark> It's a BIT small
[2:22:43] <Marpolo13> it isn't that tiny
[2:22:43] <Shadicara> That's really small
[2:22:44] <%JenovasPuppet> That's a normal jack
[2:22:44] <Fujiwara_92> so it's tiny
[2:22:44] <CrimsonFox777> Exactly Kappa
[2:22:44] <Sinister_Aglet> they gave pat the tiny one
[2:22:45] <californaya> that's just a skinny jack, for skinny pallets
[2:22:45] <tadaosmad> Smol
[2:22:45] <InfiniteSwagbito> I've used that pallet jack before
[2:22:45] <studleydoorite> you couldn't even pick up the pallet beside it with that
[2:22:46] <%SrG00SE> are you pallet jack shaming?
[2:22:46] <that_guy_from_high_school> Back to Retail
[2:22:47] <%skizzuto> it's Pat sized
[2:22:49] <Erimos> I've seen pretty small ones about that size.
[2:22:49] <+ArcLifth> narrow, not really tiny
[2:22:49] <%Typhaeon> The jokes are already writing themselves
[2:22:50] <%connos_livereview> THEY gave you that one cos ur smol
[2:22:50] <aiyobro> yeah
[2:22:50] <natebud> he not wrong
[2:22:51] <crusader_heide> What about the Huge Cop Car
[2:22:52] <%laserbeaming> I think it's cute
[2:22:52] <gustavozxd> I have a tradition to beat MegaMan x1 once a year, which is funny because speedruners beat like 30 times a day LUL
[2:22:53] <majindusto> It was BIG to you
[2:22:53] <%ElenaManetta> Pat they're calling you tiny
[2:22:57] <%ElenaManetta> in case you didn't know
[2:22:57] <+luketrapwalker> That's normal size compared to the pallet jack in Destiny 2
[2:22:59] <%ElenaManetta> also you're bald
[2:23:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Don't forget T-Jack
[2:23:02] <SundarkSoldier> I've been playing this on hardcore exclusively and like it makes me not want to play but my gf is doing standard mode so that makes me not want to do standard instead
[2:23:04] <%ooblagis> Pallet jacks aren't "narrow", they're adjustable
[2:23:12] <%ooblagis> At least the ones I've used are
[2:23:12] <Reanimator83> Tiny pallet jack for tiny boys
[2:23:15] <+comfyman12> pat how do you deal with the soul-crushing urge to hammer nails into my urethra while working at a grocery store
[2:23:17] <Boatinrob> Pat was a cop?
[2:23:20] <%SrG00SE> its not the size of the jack its how you use it
[2:23:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> have we killed marvin
[2:23:24] <%KillScottKill> LUL
[2:23:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats a no
[2:23:26] <+xx123manxx> F
[2:23:29] <tadaosmad> F
[2:23:29] <studleydoorite> the jack's length isn't enough to pick up the pallet that's RIGHT beside it

[2:24:35] <%Das_Bass> EAT SHIT speedruners
[2:24:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @StrangeCoincidence There's always ammo around during bosses, so not really
[2:24:37] <that_guy_from_high_school> Dito what was the glitch
[2:24:39] <+xx123manxx> OOB was fixed but I don't think they fixed stair skating
[2:24:41] <%laserbeaming> @Marpolo13 well, I suppose you could snitch your coworkers
[2:24:43] <%nitsuji94> glitches are for COWARDS
[2:24:44] <Gruhunchously> I'm not sure what I feel about fixing glitches like that in non-multiplayer games.
[2:24:46] <JamJamX3> @AngriestPat Actually, they just made it a lot harder to pull off, and it's ONLY from the library and Ada's segment now. Can't skip the sewers.
[2:24:49] <%connos_livereview> i member

[2:26:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Marvin's dead pat
[2:26:36] <%SrG00SE> LUL
[2:26:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> In our hearts Marvin will live on
[2:26:37] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Marvin had better get a role in REmake 3
[2:26:37] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 cast burning hands or something, causing enough damage to instakill the bard. The bard being the only one with healing capabilities. This is when I had the goblins who had been following the party attack. They were supposed to steal one of the wagons, draw the party away, so a hidden one could steal the other wagon uncontested. Then the fighter tried to intimidate them, got a nat 1, and agro'd the whole pack, ruining the plan.
[2:26:40] <+VVytchdance> LUL
[2:26:42] <JamvaanPS4> Marvin was alive at some point, I'm not sure Bosskey ever lived.
[2:26:46] <natebud> Pat you are PRETTY good on ammo i'd say
[2:26:48] <Sloavon> @Sphincter_Spelunker fuck I'm losing track of time like an old man now
[2:26:50] <majindusto> FUCK OFF CLIFFY
[2:26:53] <%foreverN2dust> But he... OH...
[2:26:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Dump the TBar. It's not needed
[2:26:58] <+C24U> @AngriestPat It's interesting how this is the first mainline RE game where zombies can actually grab you on stairs instead of barfing and it resulted in that glitch.
[2:26:59] <SundarkSoldier> Pat's running low on gunpowder tbh LUL
[2:27:06] <+Lillowh> *** @AngriestPat
[2:27:16] <+Lillowh> He's still so mad
[2:27:18] <%SrG00SE> we need the T-bar
[2:27:20] <%laserbeaming> @awsomesaucekirby you reminded me I have to finish Pathfinder Kingmaker
[2:27:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Magnum ammo (x6) on white bucket before elevator back to sewers.
[2:27:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> We need it
[2:27:25] <StrangeCoincidence> did pat already beat the DLC?
[2:27:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sloavon Happens. Last 5 or so years have been a blur to me
[2:27:28] <+xx123manxx> t bar is only needed for 2 doors
[2:27:28] <%TheShal> Marvin improved the lives of 2 people. Bosskey only ruined several thousand people's lives
[2:27:29] <natebud> grab the magnum ammo too
[2:27:31] <%ElenaManetta> Leon's ass looks really tight in low poly
[2:27:31] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat yes
[2:27:33] <%LogothX> can you destroy an item you NEED by accident?
[2:27:34] <jossahmol> nah you still need it
[2:27:36] <natebud> you really dont need the t-bar anymore
[2:27:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:27:43] <%CorvoBrooks> no
[2:27:46] <tadaosmad> Mixed messages here guys
[2:27:47] <majindusto> Mugnum
[2:27:49] <ManfredA> more than 2 @TheShal he's cool in Outbreak too
[2:27:52] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Jesus would dump the T-bar
[2:27:54] <SundarkSoldier> my dad works at capcom and he said if you combine all the weapon parts in the game with the T-Bar you get the Mega Buster
[2:27:57] <theangryguyofde> couldn't Pat have gotten the part the first time in this area?
[2:27:58] <+天使42199> MAGNUM DONG
[2:28:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> go to the locker
[2:28:02] <%ECRead> apparently a species of bee the size of a man's thumb was just rediscovered
[2:28:03] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> it's by the elevator
[2:28:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat NO down the steps right there
[2:28:10] <KeiPrime> the mugnum
[2:28:10] <studleydoorite> look at that baby pallet jack, you people are crazy
[2:28:11] <gustavozxd> @elenamanetta you should see his butt sway in the original game
[2:28:13] <SundarkSoldier> @ECRead can we reundiscover it
[2:28:15] <tadaosmad> Nice ammo.
[2:28:18] <%foreverN2dust> Mangum ammo
[2:28:20] <Erimos> I HAVE THIS
[2:28:26] <tadaosmad> Mandom ammo
[2:28:26] <+ChaosVulpes> Magnum dong
[2:28:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Heavy bullets Here
[2:28:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat TBar is unnecessary. It only opens a second route through with 3 zombies that loops back to where the knight key was
[2:28:33] <+krimulation> Mugnum Dang
[2:28:35] <tadaosmad> We in the Real Men's World here
[2:28:36] <Fujiwara_92> MY MUGNUM DONG
[2:28:37] <californaya> yeah, all the replies to that tweet saying "we discovered this giant bee" were just saying PUT IT BACK
[2:28:39] <Kyonclone7> feed the G creations, all they have to eat is poop
[2:28:41] <californaya> which I agree
[2:28:43] <Gruhunchously> Video games need more butt swaying in general.
[2:28:44] <californaya> for multiple reasons
[2:28:45] <SundarkSoldier> @californaya kek

[2:29:01] <tadaosmad> Dicksway is also good
[2:29:03] <+C24U> The other way doesnt have any G creatures
[2:29:03] <%ElenaManetta> Are you a man or a mouse
[2:29:03] <majindusto> Danger is Kiwami
[2:29:05] <KeiPrime> still?
[2:29:06] <ManfredA> what's your favorite route in the game Pat

[2:29:59] <KeiPrime> hell if pat ever needs it, he can live rent free in cliffy's head
[2:30:01] <SundarkSoldier> if you bend the T-Bar just right you can actually get the M-Bar
[2:30:02] <+tigerfang86> WE DO IT
[2:30:11] <%nitsuji94> SAVE
[2:30:13] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> WE DONE GOT IT DONE
[2:30:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you learn a few things S+ speed running under 2 hours heh
[2:30:17] <SundarkSoldier> then if you examine the M-Bar in the inventory you can rotate it upside down to get the Wum-Bar
[2:30:23] <Erimos> I love Barry so much. Excited to see him again in RE3.
[2:30:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat on hardcore
[2:30:23] <lloyddboy> BLERBS
[2:30:26] <%CorvoBrooks> Take grenades
[2:30:27] <armando00647> putos
[2:30:30] <majindusto> One "G" down
[2:30:35] <SundarkSoldier> after you get the Wum-Bar you're basically home free
[2:30:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @armando00647 oye pendejo
[2:30:41] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat how do you put secondary itmes on quickselect?
[2:30:43] <An_Armed_Bear> Feeling unloved for not being used, the T bar went on to create the T Virus
[2:30:46] <+ArcanumMBD> Is Pat going for S+?
[2:30:47] <ManfredA> I hope Nemesis is Mr. X on crack
[2:30:51] <Kyonclone7> leon goin to the sewers leather club
[2:30:52] <%Rngiddion> man I hate Birkin 2
[2:30:56] <%connos_livereview> oh no not the FUCKING goo room
[2:31:00] <%RoeDeerRootie> this part sucks ass
[2:31:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes he is
[2:31:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Pop / juke first G, then as SOON as the second one appear from behind the shitpile, SHOOT HIM twice and he dives, BEFORE he "notices" AGGROS
[2:31:09] <SundarkSoldier> Is it possible to kill Birkin 2 without using the crane or is it crane-only
[2:31:10] <tadaosmad> Blightown
[2:31:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ManfredA I hope so as well
[2:31:15] <majindusto> Evil Red Room
[2:31:16] <%CorvoBrooks> when you hold L1 they auto quick select
[2:31:16] <Sloavon> nope
[2:31:17] <jossahmol> yes
[2:31:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> No
[2:31:17] <+xx123manxx> yes
[2:31:18] <danknugglit> Goo hall KIWAMI
[2:31:18] <Fujiwara_92> he is going for S+ Kappa
[2:31:19] <Happy_Karl> @AngriestPat Why no original music?
[2:31:19] <Djinnazz> No
[2:31:20] <%nitsuji94> icky pooey
[2:31:20] <%CerberusDriver> its the worst
[2:31:20] <KeiPrime> the most annoying to be sure
[2:31:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yes this is one of the most fucking broken / difficult
[2:31:20] <%mayorrev> what are the requirements for S+?
[2:31:21] <%Plague_Nurse> SAVE
[2:31:21] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat what about S - ?
[2:31:22] <+ArcanumMBD> just gotta dodge the grab. Easy peasy
[2:31:22] <+Tornix> I guess if you don't have subweapons
[2:31:23] <SundarkSoldier> This is 100% the worst room in the game and it is possibly the worst room in video games
[2:31:23] <b0bm3h> I think this room is my personal hardest
[2:31:23] <%Laecerelius> Time for the Nurgle hallway
[2:31:24] <Erimos> It's up there.
[2:31:24] <+Noxybaru> it's way up there
[2:31:24] <+0oki> good ol orgain trail
[2:31:27] <VanLynx> most annoying
[2:31:28] <%laserbeaming> difficulty is subjective
[2:31:29] <+C24U> It depends
[2:31:30] <ManfredA> @SundarkSoldier you can one cycle him but yeah, he can only die to crane I think
[2:31:30] <DracaenaLeaf> This is what the hell was that?
[2:31:33] <+Tornix> or know how to despawn them
[2:31:35] <%foreverN2dust> LUL
[2:31:35] <tadaosmad> OH MAN
[2:31:36] <+pl0xzz> yes
[2:31:36] <KeiPrime> get gooped on
[2:31:36] <forlorncarton> too close
[2:31:38] <KeystoneA1> It's not so bad if you just use the magnum
[2:31:39] <danknugglit> Calculated
[2:31:41] <tungstenviper> You gotta stun
[2:31:42] <%connos_livereview> its less hard more FUCKING ANNOYING
[2:31:42] <%mayorrev> 1
[2:31:43] <%nitsuji94> u ran forward too early, wait for it
[2:31:43] <Grennold> G-units are definite ammo sponges
[2:31:43] <%laserbeaming> Give him a kiss!
[2:31:43] <%Laecerelius> 0 frame grab!
[2:31:44] <thecrispyones> BibleThump
[2:31:44] <+ArcanumMBD> DODGE the grab Pat, not GET grabbed
[2:31:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Too close. Pop from a few feet back for first one.
[2:31:45] <HaloPlayerNamedJohn> I was thinking about an RE 0 remake with co-op
[2:31:45] <+luketrapwalker> EWW WutFace
[2:31:45] <majindusto> NOPE LOL
[2:31:45] <%GohanEgret> n u t
[2:31:47] <Ion_LaserX> gross
[2:31:47] <Marpolo13> ewwwww
[2:31:47] <azacca_bitter> HORF
[2:31:48] <+xx123manxx> @mayorrev under 2:30 hardcore no more than 3 saves no infiniite weapons except the knife
[2:31:49] <tadaosmad> :/
[2:31:50] <+zanzibar_junker> no lab is harder
[2:31:50] <Gruhunchously> Wrong
[2:31:51] <%laserbeaming> !TOXIC !
[2:31:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[2:31:52] <the_toxic_korgi> is there an answer to what the viscera and goo caked in this area is?
[2:31:52] <Josef_Stryker> Ewwwww
[2:31:53] <+C24U> Hardest for Leon would be the double Licker rooms since his shotgun can't stun them for shit
[2:31:53] <+天使42199> 🦀 PAT IS WRONG 🦀
[2:31:55] <%skizzuto> do those things sing?
[2:31:59] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> You gotta do the S+ run one day, and then do the "I GOT INFINITE BULLETS!!!" run after that.
[2:31:59] <KeiPrime> get harfed on
[2:32:01] <majindusto> WHY DO THE SING?
[2:32:06] <Tampaoster> Get the map you coward
[2:32:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Right side has more room *USUALLY*
[2:32:08] <+0oki> are you streaming with woolie tomorrow?
[2:32:08] <+kolen4566> @angriestpat are you gonna use the grenade trick for G2?
[2:32:11] <Shadicara> You get it wrongo and you get the songo
[2:32:11] <majindusto> "THEY"
[2:32:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Lab is easier
[2:32:14] <ManfredA> @C24U if you mean the NEST the flamethrower is op as shit on lickers
[2:32:16] <%nitsuji94> lab is the easiest imo
[2:32:17] <Frostydough> lab is easiest part of the game
[2:32:17] <Shadicara> dongo*
[2:32:20] <KeystoneA1> Just throw a grenade when the lickers show up
[2:32:21] <frogurtz> Lab is much easier.
[2:32:21] <+xx123manxx> lab is easy are you high
[2:32:22] <%CorvoBrooks> Lab is not to bad
[2:32:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The hardest is around the Police Station
[2:32:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Even though it's *grab arm* side, he's still "waking up"
[2:32:23] <SundarkSoldier> This room would be more enjoyable with Winter Lanterns
[2:32:24] <KeystoneA1> Then unload into them
[2:32:25] <KeystoneA1> Ez
[2:32:25] <%ECRead> you were thinking you wanted that sweet, sweet goo
[2:32:26] <%connos_livereview> @the_toxic_korgi Birkins baby batter
[2:32:30] <natebud> the trick is use a grenade
[2:32:31] <+countgaculatv> Lab is super ez the fk you mean?
[2:32:35] <TeamAMFer> tip on first one stay to the very left should push you past first one
[2:32:36] <%CorvoBrooks> run into them
[2:32:37] <tadaosmad> That's a good trick
[2:32:38] <+RC_S3kshun8> you hit them with the grenade
[2:32:39] <%nitsuji94> grenade stuns them? Idk
[2:32:40] <the_toxic_korgi> Lab doesnt have G creatures so its way easier
[2:32:44] <Shadicara> The trick is throw it at them
[2:32:44] <TeamAMFer> when walking
[2:32:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Use a lot of grenades? lol
[2:32:47] <+Tornix> I'd gladly burn a couple subweapons to get through
[2:32:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> throw them
[2:32:50] <aiyobro> lab sucks because of the lickers constantly tracking you
[2:32:51] <SundarkSoldier> The hardest part in the game is the hallway corner right outside the Watchman's Room imo
[2:32:53] <danknugglit> The trick is grenades go boom
[2:32:57] <tungstenviper> Lab is a stroll if you know how to manage your resources
[2:32:59] <+xx123manxx> too far pat
[2:33:03] <tadaosmad> Oh noooo...
[2:33:05] <Erimos> I'd say the hardest part is the club room past the lickers in the station.
[2:33:05] <+Tornix> and you can get out without taking damage on the way back
[2:33:06] <sparkyslol> you can get a LOT closer
[2:33:10] <SnaKemuho> roll cancel the grenades for faster recovery
[2:33:11] <+aspirationdeath> Hardest part of s+ was lickers plus mr x plus window hallway. That hall ruined so many runs
[2:33:12] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you need to bait out the grab then run back to avoid it, then you get sneak by
[2:33:13] <%nitsuji94> left side pat, left side
[2:33:13] <Frostydough> @AngriestPat Hey pat theres strat where you compleety unloaod on bikrin with the flamethrower and you can one cycle him with the crane
[2:33:16] <%CorvoBrooks> to close quarters
[2:33:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat closer. Like 1-leon body length
[2:33:24] <+xx123manxx> you wanna be close but not too close because you will get stunned
[2:33:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Double arm distance
[2:33:27] <Fujiwara_92> C L O S E R
[2:33:30] <grimshuck> Hi Pat!
[2:33:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> left side baka
[2:33:33] <+Tornix> flame thrower on birking is legit
[2:33:33] <+Maids4lyfe> not grabbing the map?
[2:33:34] <SundarkSoldier> just watch his footsies bro
[2:33:34] <+kolen4566> @angriestpat skip the power room with a grenade
[2:33:37] <+Tornix> birkin*
[2:33:37] <Panquake25> anyone else think that slime texture looks...poor?
[2:33:52] <godzookylives> Classic Leon is the most hideous monster in this game
[2:33:54] <majindusto> CLOSER...But not too Closer
[2:33:54] <+Tornix> down him twice with flamethrower and then call the container
[2:33:57] <playdohface> G2 is ez. I did it just juking didnt use anything
[2:34:01] <%connos_livereview> it did look pretty wierd
[2:34:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @AngriestPat Defensive weapon the first GAdult, Juke the second one by going left and circling it, dodge the last one before it comes out of the sewer hole
[2:34:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Panquake25 it looks accurate to snot
[2:34:14] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Classic Leon is a beautiful angel.
[2:34:17] <+zanzibar_junker> just shotgun the plants and run past
[2:34:17] <sparkyslol> go left too, left for 1st, right for 2nd, hug wall on 3rd
[2:34:21] <SundarkSoldier> classic leon actually looks super funny
[2:34:26] <SundarkSoldier> and I think it's godlike
[2:34:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GO
[2:34:35] <godzookylives> It's the arms that get me
[2:34:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> too late
[2:34:36] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Has anyone figured out how fire DOT works yet? It's looks like after a point they don't take damage anymore even when they are still on fire
[2:34:36] <%SrG00SE> you were asking for that
[2:34:36] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you flinched. You need to pop and run at that distance, but as SOON as you pop
[2:34:40] <tungstenviper> @Panquake25 yeah they saved space on some textures
[2:34:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[2:34:40] <Fujiwara_92> oof
[2:34:41] <SundarkSoldier> geeeeeet gooped on
[2:34:42] <Sloavon> @Panquake25 it's gross and that satisfies me
[2:34:42] <sparkyslol> when you shoot it you have to run the second you are done shooting
[2:34:42] <+extra_thick_rick> LUL LUL LUL
[2:34:42] <TranquilTurnip> every time Leon EUGHs take a drink

[2:34:59] <thecrispyones> he can also swing twice in a row
[2:34:59] <+0oki> just use the flash granade
[2:35:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> you have the infinite handgun, use that
[2:35:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat Would you like to try assisted mode?
[2:35:03] <%foreverN2dust> Chat is sending mixed messages.

[2:35:19] <Fujiwara_92> BIG 3
[2:35:20] <the_toxic_korgi> You probably have to kill the first two G creatures but the last one can be ran past

[2:35:42] <natebud> you will not need the gun later
[2:35:43] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Wear the pink ribbon.
[2:35:45] <Erimos> I wonder if the reason Ada always avoids Leon is because he permanently stinks of shit from all the sewers he's had to run through.
[2:35:46] <%MarylandJutsu> SHOOT...THE GLAAAASSS
[2:35:48] <$cureneckbeard> What if I need it later?

[2:35:49] <KeystoneA1> *Later* "I don't want to shoot the gun I might need it more later"
[2:35:49] <+Tornix> the first one's too much of a pain to not burn a sub weapon tbh

[2:42:44] <%mayorrev> weeeed
[2:42:44] <thecrispyones> CrreamAwk
[2:42:45] <Ion_LaserX> Chrisposting won't stop til RE3 Remake
[2:42:45] <%SrG00SE> never stop chrisposting
[2:42:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dutch has a plan, Chris. Have some goddamn faith
[2:42:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> The wong bloodline must continue
[2:42:48] <aiyobro> you have to damage him
[2:43:08] <PSI_Guy95> hit him with The Shit
[2:43:10] <aiyobro> pretty sure he shrugs it off
[2:43:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just stand beside the bucket
[2:43:13] <%CorvoBrooks> no
[2:43:15] <aiyobro> use both
[2:43:16] <+SWFanatic> Shoot the Glass
[2:43:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Go to the door where he claws, and as soon as you dodge it, GRENADE THE DOOR and he's like RAWR wtf! and opens it, instead of clawing the ceiling.
[2:43:18] <+天使42199> you MUST SHOOT
[2:43:20] <+xx123manxx> You crane him twice, but if you want one cycle you have to damage him till the eye is red @AngriestPat
[2:43:21] <+AppleBasket> why is Leon a box?
[2:43:23] <KolpaxTV> @AngriestPat just wanted to drop by real quick and say thanks for that CliffyB tweet. Made my day dude.
[2:43:26] <%SrG00SE> do you actually have to?
[2:43:27] <%Plague_Nurse> Already calling it, 3
[2:43:28] <+Deleran> You can hit him 3 times.
[2:43:28] <%connos_livereview> @rad_rice Nah he achieved orgasm hours ago
[2:43:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @SundarkSoldier Check what I sent to Pat
[2:43:31] <InfiniteSwagbito> You can hit him twice and it works. If you want to only hit him once, you damage him enough
[2:43:31] <%CorvoBrooks> It will take more than 2
[2:43:31] <bigtheloaf> shit that skin is god tier
[2:43:32] <natebud> did they patch the bucket trick?
[2:43:32] <PSI_Guy95> protip: to kill the cyberdemon, hit it with the Shit until it dies
[2:43:33] <SnaKemuho> just take a huge dump and then flash
[2:43:34] <%ECRead> FLASH! AAAaaaaAAA!
[2:43:34] <Shadicara> Guns are for cowards
[2:43:35] <+qwazzeon> 2 flash grenades, 2 crane hits. EZ.
[2:43:36] <+zanzibar_junker> knee him and use knife
[2:43:37] <%SrG00SE> i really thought you could just stand there
[2:43:41] <natebud> three times on hardcore
[2:43:42] <SundarkSoldier> @FirearmsInstructor wtf that's broken
[2:43:42] <%QueequegTheater> Look out it's Cliffy B
[2:43:45] <tadaosmad> Double Crane Jutsu
[2:43:47] <Djinnazz> then bring the Mag.
[2:43:48] <the_toxic_korgi> its 3 times on hardcore
[2:43:48] <majindusto> And the Chrisposting will return when Code Veronica gets remade
[2:43:50] <%Prism_Wing> That feeling when Leon's cock isn't in your sister BibleThump
[2:43:52] <%Plague_Nurse> 2 times on hardcore
[2:43:53] <%Das_Bass> Cliffy B is here?
[2:43:54] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> i say try doing the flash only and see what happens @angriestpat
[2:43:55] <%QueequegTheater> Oh wait, no, he tripped over himself and died
[2:44:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater HEY don't insult berkin that way
[2:44:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat His AI makes him grab you for 2nd crane unless he's taking a knee at the time. It's rough.
[2:44:10] <%nitsuji94> biglag
[2:44:12] <SundarkSoldier> I think by default it's 3 times on hardcore but you can whittle him down and it takes less
[2:44:14] <+zanzibar_junker> save those flash for the lab
[2:44:17] <+TheUberknife> its jason bourne

[2:49:37] <natebud> pat fell for the "there's a trick" trick i see
[2:49:38] <+Jinxzers> pooLul
[2:49:38] <Shadicara> Guns are the enemy
[2:49:40] <%Fenlig> easily the worst part of the game
[2:49:41] <+krispen_wa> FLAWLESS VICTORY
[2:49:42] <ThorW> @AngriestPat Would you ever speedrun RE2? Legit curious
[2:49:44] <%Rngiddion> I legit despise this boss
[2:49:45] <+SWFanatic> Pat's demonstrating how to not win
[2:49:46] <+zanzibar_junker> flamethrower
[2:49:48] <SnaKemuho> I see *pic of blind Kakyoin*
[2:49:48] <%CorvoBrooks> yes
[2:49:49] <%connos_livereview> truly the greatest foe of all CRANE
[2:49:49] <KeystoneA1> @Sphincter_Spelunker I know right. I looked forward to October because of the Shitstorm. I really hope Pat and Woolie do a few videos this year of puppet combo games
[2:49:50] <Idon__> Nothing wastes time like trying to save time.
[2:49:51] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Gotta stun the nerd first
[2:49:51] <%templar010> The Evil was Defeated! :D
[2:49:52] <tadaosmad> Berkin just went *what*
[2:49:53] <Ion_LaserX> Birkin Wins! HARI KIRI
[2:49:53] <+Lillowh> This fight is so abysmal compared to the design of the rest of the game it knocks it down a full point for me, honestly
[2:49:55] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Stop dropping your shield
[2:49:55] <Frostydough> @AngriestPat flashbang then flamethrower
[2:49:57] <copyritetm> Clappy flamethrower is op strat
[2:50:00] <+tigerfang86> Imagine Cliffy B trying to own Pat, Pat owned himself first
[2:50:00] <danknugglit> Way to use your head leon
[2:50:04] <%SrG00SE> wait this ISNT THE SPEEDRUN?
[2:50:05] <theangryguyofde> Sewers with stage hazards turned on is banned in Smash bmao10Smug
[2:50:06] <%blastazoid26> [HABLANDO LOCO]
[2:50:07] <%HyperCharge_Sam> it's not hard if you actually shoot em LUL
[2:50:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat best way to fuck his shit up is to magnum his BACK eye when he breaks through, then ARM eye, THEN flamethrower / slow walk backwards
[2:50:11] <ThorW> I'd love to see Pat lean the speedrun PogChamp
[2:50:16] <TheCrook92> Stream moar ThorW cirSmug

[2:50:20] <Shadicara> Big galaxy brain to set this fucker on fire
[2:50:20] <%rad_rice> can't wait for pat at next AGDQ

[2:50:49] <DonatelloJose> The day I show up and see splits, I will subscribe
[2:50:49] <the_toxic_korgi> Has anyone beaten him without using the crate yet?
[2:50:53] <Erimos> @AngriestPat if you have the infinite knife, you can use that if you go for S ranks.
[2:50:59] <Shadicara> Guns are for the poor
[2:51:00] <+JohnMarkley> hi @Mr_Taters :) /
[2:51:00] <+tigerfang86> NEVER shoot a gun
[2:51:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat shotty his back eye, then arm eye
[2:51:02] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> G4 ruin TechTV
[2:51:02] <+C24U> RE2 Pacifist run
[2:51:05] <majindusto> Try using them
[2:51:05] <Sloavon> then why take them???????
[2:51:05] <+xx123manxx> cant @the_toxic_korgi
[2:51:07] <ThorW> @the_toxic_korgi he's scripted, you can't beat him without th ecrate
[2:51:10] <+wolfhaley1331> You shoulda brought a knife then
[2:51:11] <+Lillowh> @CorvoBrooks The problem is when you design a fight where you can use no guns it's bad when it's entirely reliant on cooperative AI
[2:51:14] <+xx123manxx> too late
[2:51:15] <tadaosmad> Just a bop of the shotty
[2:51:15] <+G_Thunders> If you’re willing to use ammo and health resources this fight is one-shot every time. No idea how some people can have such a problem with it
[2:51:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Guns are for people who aren't comfortably retired
[2:51:26] <+TheUberknife> kill it with fire
[2:51:28] <Idon__> hmm beef jerkey
[2:51:31] <danknugglit> Pat will finish with 100 rounds to spare

[2:55:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat so the crane can smack him
[2:55:04] <%Plague_Nurse> Do more damage

[2:57:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat plays this game to relax. Like Paige does Dead by Daylight
[2:57:09] <+G_Thunders> This strimmer is bad at RE2
[2:57:09] <%templar010> Resident Evil is a fun video game franchise :D

[2:57:22] <throwsian> Hey pat I think you need to hit the eye
[2:57:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@umbracatalyst)
[2:57:27] <Tampaoster> MOUSE AND keyboard is better in this game but pat is a stubborn son of a gun and wont use it
[2:57:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat His arm moves like a "+" up and down and side to side. Try to fire the gun when he's int he middle of the "+"
[2:57:30] <+SWFanatic> That's Right Jay!
[2:57:31] <rhus> so this is what it is to be Woolie

[2:57:39] <+天使42199> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah that was one of the goodies I missed lacF
[2:57:44] <SnaKemuho> you should practice your aiming in that new hot game Radical Heights
[2:57:45] <%ElenaManetta> brute force it
[2:57:47] <natebud> might as well attach the matilda stock and use some of that pistol ammo up
[2:57:48] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> It's fine PixelBob
[2:57:51] <%skizzuto> Pat you have so much goddamn gunpowder and herbs

[3:20:59] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Bring the pistol and just pop an ivy bulb. it staggers

[3:24:26] <+zanzibar_junker> Extreme
[3:24:27] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat the more comments and the fewer likes/RTs you have, the more likely it is that you tweeted a Bad Thing
[3:24:27] <+xx123manxx> this time you get to decide whats more valuable, 1 frag or 3 shotty shells, (frags are better for g3)
[3:24:30] <PSI_Guy95> Replies > Likes, and I guess all the replies likes > your original comment's likes
[3:24:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Several people are typing
[3:24:32] <+JEiddew> the golden ratio is special because it's really hard to estimate
[3:24:33] <+jubjub1276> More people are telling you how stupid you are then you have likes essentially
[3:24:33] <%Keyd00d> it's slang for "cliffy b"
[3:24:33] <aimlesshealer> Twitter is very, very dumb
[3:24:35] <%ooblagis> Twitter IS dumb
[3:24:35] <+ArcanumMBD> Twitter was a bigger mistake than anime
[3:24:37] <+天使42199> caring about internet points lacWeird
[3:24:37] <+manwithboxonhead> Words
[3:24:44] <tadaosmad> Double dumb
[3:24:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Twitter is stupid
[3:24:48] <tadaosmad> I love it

[3:24:52] <%connos_livereview> stan is good tho i like stan
[3:24:53] <+RichardButt1> just had anthem crash on me 4 times in 1 hour so thats neat

[3:25:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol good jerb
[3:25:57] <dreu81> Nailed it
[3:25:57] <Shadicara> Get fuuuucked lickers
[3:26:01] <%connos_livereview> railed annoys the fuck uot of me as a phrase for some reason
[3:26:01] <%ooblagis> Twitter is like some kind of weird science experiment on seeing just how much you can deteriorate human discourse, and still have people be convinced that they can still say something not stupid
[3:26:02] <+Eddy21forsaken> You....did it
[3:26:03] <+TheUberknife> You fucked him up harder than Cliffy B fucked up his employees
[3:26:06] <majindusto> DOUBLE LICC
[3:26:07] <%Fenlig> Get the trophy?
[3:26:08] <+Grayhammatter> kablamzo
[3:26:09] <natebud> Now this is late game RE2
[3:26:14] <+SWFanatic> its effective against living things
[3:26:17] <$Tuskor13> oh man i just found the pat and paige vs cliffy b twitter fight this is some spicy shit i love yall
[3:26:18] <PSI_Guy95> No, don't get up
[3:26:18] <+ArcanumMBD> Everyone in chat expecting Pat to play flawlessly and use the perfect amount of resources needs to chill out
[3:26:20] <+JEiddew> nice
[3:26:20] <jossahmol> so chunky
[3:26:22] <%Tman451> 2spooky
[3:26:24] <Enryuan> If you already know the code the trophy is useless
[3:26:25] <%Keyd00d> mind if I drop in
[3:26:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Ignore woman at top
[3:26:27] <aaronacmbeckham> hows he got so much shotty ammo?
[3:26:27] <Ion_LaserX> I've got THIS
[3:26:27] <%HyperCharge_Sam> so much shotgun ammo holy hell
[3:26:28] <tri3dgE027> The Grenades are more useful to end the Tyrant Fight early, but since this is not a non-S+ Run, it's still good
[3:26:29] <%GohanEgret> lol that body is like the silent hill 2 flop guys
[3:26:30] <madogod> Pat is trigger happy
[3:26:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its only there in B run
[3:26:31] <ManfredA> broke: using Twitter for discussion woke: using twitter as a porn site
[3:26:32] <Shadicara> Turning everything into chunks is late game RE
[3:26:33] <%ThirdWelles> @Fenlig Doesn't need the trophy. he has the code cheat sheet
[3:26:34] <%CorvoBrooks> who?
[3:26:34] <+Grayhammatter> chunked him real good
[3:26:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The ivy
[3:26:40] <robbtre> That was just an old man falling down the stairs FeelsBadMan
[3:26:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat He's only there if you go back up the stairs after you get the solution and try to avoid the main ivy area with Plant 43
[3:26:45] <+C24U> rude to call her bitch Leon
[3:26:46] <+JEiddew> scree
[3:26:47] <%connos_livereview> twitter is a trash fire i LOVE it
[3:26:49] <dreu81> Shotgun Pat joins the battle
[3:26:49] <natebud> I have no head and i must scream
[3:26:49] <%GohanEgret> twitter is for stanning kpop groups anyway
[3:26:51] <+SWFanatic> head = strawberry
[3:26:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ManfredA Have to now that Tumblr shot itself
[3:26:52] <third_impact_762> lol that scream lasted longer than her head

[3:26:52] <%CorvoBrooks> the ivy is only in B
[3:26:53] <%pressxtojasek> i believe that was the most well choreographed pat has ever been

[3:27:00] <Pajex_> there goes that aiming problem Kappa
[3:27:01] <+Grayhammatter> MUF
[3:27:04] <Taffer85> forgot the MURF
[3:27:05] <+JEiddew> What is stanning? Just supporting something, right?

[3:27:59] <+Grayhammatter> the pouch, gotta get the pouch
[3:28:01] <%CorvoBrooks> no pouch
[3:28:01] <%ooblagis> Is it a pouch in Hardcore?

[3:28:38] <milk2b> it is
[3:28:41] <+Grayhammatter> we require MUF
[3:28:45] <+xx123manxx> It's two in RPD and one in the Lab for hardcore I believe

[3:28:46] <milk2b> but is not that useful
[3:28:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you ran too close to the door and activated it. There MIGHT be a zombie in the hall on the return. Careful.
[3:28:49] <OswaldTheDog> the pouch, gotta get the pouch
[3:28:49] <%CorvoBrooks> My bad then
[3:28:50] <PSI_Guy95> I love that Pat is such a shitlord that the people who would pick fights with him have to be literal sewer mutants crawling out of the gutter
[3:28:50] <+SWFanatic> eat muf
[3:28:52] <aiyobro> muf lol
[3:28:53] <Gruhunchously> Someone has to stick it to rude out of work developers who think their still relevant.

[3:29:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> bye LI hope you enjoy being a zombie forever
[3:29:13] <aaronacmbeckham> there is a pouch iv complete it on claire harcore
[3:29:15] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Which would you rather have? 3 pouches that gave you 2 slots each or 6 pouches that gave you 1 each on Hardcore?
[3:29:15] <+SolidusRex> Doin' it we doin' it we doin' it well
[3:29:19] <$imextremelymanly> nah man it was the batman asylum minigame
[3:29:19] <Ion_LaserX> @Gruhunchously And who jump on the Battle Royale bandwagon way too late
[3:29:20] <tadaosmad> Big pouches for big men
[3:29:22] <+SWFanatic> pat never pretended to have shame
[3:29:27] <dreu81> Don’t be lyin about the pouch
[3:29:29] <%CorvoBrooks> I honestly thought there was no pouch
[3:29:32] <+krispen_wa> Is this Dock Ock's PS1 lair?
[3:29:36] <+天使42199> 3
[3:29:39] <%Aztec50> 3
[3:29:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> three
[3:29:40] <neooneshin> 6
[3:29:41] <tadaosmad> 6
[3:29:41] <Erimos> 3
[3:29:41] <%Tman451> 3 pooches
[3:29:41] <%SentientHoodie> 3
[3:29:42] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> 1 pouch that gives you 12
[3:29:42] <%Plague_Nurse> 3
[3:29:42] <+Grayhammatter> big fanny packs
[3:29:44] <PSI_Guy95> @Tuskor13 tru
[3:29:44] <%nobodyinparticular> progression
[3:29:44] <Shadicara> 6
[3:29:45] <Mnightshyamallama> 6/1 because you pick them up more often
[3:29:46] <natebud> BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MORE
[3:29:47] <+天使42199> 3 cause you have to find LESS
[3:29:47] <%skizzuto> the difference is the granularity of the upgrades
[3:29:49] <%ooblagis> 6, cleaner progression curve
[3:29:50] <+TheUberknife> If you're going 80 miles per hour how long would it take to go 80 miles?
[3:29:50] <+xx123manxx> Key items on the bottom and things you don't have to use on top? You're an absolute animal @AngriestPat
[3:29:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @krispen_wa of course not crime doesn't pay
[3:29:50] <%ThePuddingDead> one requires more searching for 1 space trade off, i'd rather take the 3
[3:29:51] <%connos_livereview> 3 easy
[3:29:51] <%GohanEgret> acquisition rate might be different
[3:29:52] <+Ell1ot> 1
[3:29:53] <$imextremelymanly> 6 pouches sounds more annoying you'll have to find them all
[3:29:53] <%Laecerelius> I'd imagine the 6 would be more spread out
[3:29:55] <FirearmsInstructor> Effort to acquire?
[3:29:55] <$eldrich_horror> 3 cuz less looking for more pouches
[3:29:56] <tadaosmad> Gimme them faster
[3:29:56] <+天使42199> cause you have to find LESS pouches
[3:30:00] <%Aztec50> but you have 6 items to pick up instead of 3
[3:30:00] <%skizzuto> no difference at the end but progress more evenly
[3:30:04] <ShichiNoBushi> 6 because you will get individual slots sooner, I suppose.
[3:30:05] <%Das_Bass> they're both a kilo
[3:30:08] <Exicuren> 1 pouch that gives 6 slots
[3:30:08] <%ReturnF1re> apatWhat
[3:30:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Save & box grenade. They're super valuable.
[3:30:12] <lloyddboy> MURF
[3:30:13] <%ThePuddingDead> searching for a 1 space increase, no
[3:30:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> but six is more to find.
[3:30:14] <Shadicara> it's a trick question
[3:30:15] <tadaosmad> Educational Memes
[3:30:16] <SweetCuppingCake> The best thing to come out of the Cliffy B argument was Pat resurfacing that photo of himself with a large chocolate bunny
[3:30:16] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Six would be much more spread out.
[3:30:18] <SundarkSoldier> 12 pouches that give half a slot
[3:30:21] <+C24U> @AngriestPat It would change runs because it changes the pathing and how quickly you get slots
[3:30:22] <Erimos> 3 feels more impactful
[3:30:24] <%falineth> do smaller ones make it harder to store large items?
[3:30:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What's heavier, a kilo of feathers or a kilo of iron
[3:30:25] <aiyobro> i'd rather have 3 pouches anda muf
[3:30:25] <SundarkSoldier> oh cool i'm unbanned
[3:30:27] <%connos_livereview> but feathers are hevier than steel
[3:30:29] <natebud> But you'll also get pouches at a steadier pace
[3:30:32] <SundarkSoldier> raise your ooooweeees
[3:30:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Half a pouch that gives 12 slots.
[3:30:34] <majindusto> Leshould be looking like a Rob Liefeld character with all the pouches he has
[3:30:36] <crusader_heide> None i want to be a pouch
[3:30:36] <+Grayhammatter> aw yeah, it's MURF time
[3:30:38] <tadaosmad> ofc a kilo of iron, what are you saying

[3:31:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Can't risk it on this not-S run
[3:31:54] <the_toxic_korgi> Has Pat played 4th survivor yet?

[3:32:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Server room
[3:32:04] <%soulbr4dd4> It would be cool to have a surprise ending like with Silent Hill and it was aaaaall staged by the pouch in the monitor room...
[3:32:05] <+LadyFrederic47> risk it 4 the biscuit
[3:32:06] <Caidezes> Currently going through and liking all of Pat's recent tweets. Cliffy reminds me of an angry teen desperately trying to seem calm.
[3:32:06] <milk2b> maybe she comes to life if you check the pc?
[3:32:12] <%dmdyne99> Has Pat played TOFU yet?
[3:32:14] <aiyobro> the animation isn't that hard actually, the model is way harder to make
[3:32:15] <%ThirdWelles> @milk2b She doesn't
[3:32:20] <SundarkSoldier> she super aggros I don't remember when
[3:32:22] <+lana_____> firearmsinstructor how you gonna sit there at your PC giving the streamer literally every single piece of backseat information you could give like why are you even watching someone play if you're gonna try and tell them how at every turn lmfao
[3:32:22] <%GohanEgret> look at these computahs
[3:32:23] <FirearmsInstructor> Delicious delicious fuel.
[3:32:27] <PSI_Guy95> LMAO zombies that come to life if you read emails
[3:32:29] <milk2b> that's an odd zombie
[3:32:33] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @wydamn Now that's what I call a close encounter
[3:32:34] <+Grayhammatter> imma compoota
[3:32:35] <$imextremelymanly> i don't think pat beat tofu yet
[3:32:35] <+zanzibar_junker> keep cool
[3:32:36] <+xx123manxx> ima computah stop all the downloadin
[3:32:42] <SundarkSoldier> @PSI_Guy95 tbh that's just spammers in a nusthell
[3:32:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> help computer
[3:32:46] <Ultimatefool> Wtf this is on hardcore? How does he have so much ammo?
[3:32:46] <crusader_heide> Good Save
[3:32:49] <%ooblagis> 48 Shotgun rounds will kill every zombie left in game twice over
[3:32:50] <animalxer> 40 shells
[3:32:54] <%GohanEgret> @Ultimatefool it's pat
[3:32:57] <SundarkSoldier> @Ultimatefool look don't worry about it ok
[3:32:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> PORKCHOP SANDWlCHES?! OH SHIT!
[3:32:58] <+ArcanumMBD> I think this is the most stressed Pat sighs I've heard in an LP
[3:33:00] <%tweedler92> holy shit the gunpowder LUL
[3:33:01] <+TheHeroAppears> @Ultimatefool it's pat
[3:33:02] <Nepsotic> @lana_____ thank you for saying what needed to be said
[3:33:05] <%ThirdWelles> @Ultimatefool he never. Ever. EVER. Uses it
[3:33:05] <Ion_LaserX> @Ultimatefool he's hoarding big time
[3:33:07] <$Hommando> @Ultimatefool Once you know what to do you'd be surprised how little you have to shoot your gun
[3:33:09] <+risenchudjr> Wesker loves the smell of his own farts
[3:33:11] <tadaosmad> Never use ammo
[3:33:11] <+C24U> @AngriestPat My pouch question means it would change how quickly you would get all 6 item slots. If you got 6 pouches for 6 slots than you would have 5 slots by time you get to lab instead of 4
[3:33:11] <%NobleJedi> don't shoot
[3:33:12] <%HyperCharge_Sam> just do a pacifist run
[3:33:12] <%ThePuddingDead> run like a bitch
[3:33:13] <krymzen5> he's insane
[3:33:13] <takokasa> just never shoot anything 4Head
[3:33:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What if he needs it later
[3:33:15] <+harryf11> Emails are sacred, that zambambo is allowed to be pissed :P
[3:33:15] <%CorvoBrooks> He is just that good
[3:33:15] <%megabrogus> is there an eta on apex?
[3:33:15] <%skizzuto> just be a compulsive hoarder
[3:33:15] <+Dr_Butthurt_PhD> just don't shoot 4Head
[3:33:16] <%pressxtojasek> git gud
[3:33:17] <+Grayhammatter> 40 shells, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:33:17] <aaronacmbeckham> u think re3 will be a dlc or a stand alone game?
[3:33:17] <xeros720> it's easy when you don't shoot hte gun
[3:33:19] <%FackinCrazy> I wonder if it would be possible to add a dlc that literally rips the ps1 textures for everything and adds them to the game
[3:33:19] <$Tuskor13> just dont use it 4Head
[3:33:21] <%soulbr4dd4> be glad this wasnt developed by Bethesda, or else yo ass BE BANNED!! :D
[3:33:21] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is big good at ammo management
[3:33:21] <+Name_Meme> Just stop shooting 4Head
[3:33:23] <%connos_livereview> by dying and reloading the save repeatedly
[3:33:28] <RomieDBG> @Grayhammatter love the ocelot reference
[3:33:31] <Shadicara> Be a hoarding gnome Kappa
[3:33:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Banned for too much ammo
[3:33:32] <Ion_LaserX> @soulbr4dd4 LUL
[3:33:34] <tadaosmad> Compare with Max hardcore playthrough
[3:33:35] <%ThirdWelles> Can't run out of ammo if you never fire the gun *points to head*
[3:33:37] <Grennold> Just don't use it LOL 4Head
[3:33:37] <+天使42199> its easy when you barely ever shoot
[3:33:38] <%Aztec50> why does the solution not kill the zombies as well?
[3:33:39] <PSI_Guy95> Dispensing a record without permission??? THAT'S GOIN ON YOUR END OF YEAR REPORT
[3:33:39] <$imextremelymanly> you run like a big coward
[3:33:39] <+TheHeroAppears> @connos_livereview we edit those out in post
[3:33:40] <mechromancer758> Just don't use any of it.
[3:33:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @lana_____ Nah just Pat and he is taking the advice and seems to be ok with it. I've played so many times doing speedruns I know some tricks so I know what's up.

[3:34:15] <%GohanEgret> OhMyDog
[3:34:15] <SundarkSoldier> @Aztec50 probably some nonsense about how the spores are already inside their human bodies and the solution doesn't get all up in there?
[3:34:15] <+risenchudjr> I love those fingers
[3:34:16] <NoirePanzer> But the grenade!

[3:34:36] <+xx123manxx> I had to go this way on my first run cuz the plants blocked me
[3:34:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> listen
[3:34:37] <PSI_Guy95> At this point it's less like X GON GIV IT TO YA and more like Woolie welcoming you at the start of a Fisticuffs Friday
[3:34:42] <Exicuren> Wait, what, that's how you avoid him?
[3:34:43] <FirearmsInstructor> +Ivy
[3:34:44] <$waltzqueen> its what you hearin

[3:35:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> only after you poision the plant
[3:35:00] <%CorvoBrooks> did not know
[3:35:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Post vaccine

[3:35:03] <%ThirdWelles> @imextremelymanly No subweapons, several ivies, and Mr. X? Yeah, no. The long way is the way to go in hardcore
[3:35:04] <Jaysky> The noises those things make just sound like clickers
[3:35:04] <+天使42199> @brickwall35 no
[3:35:06] <+xx123manxx> no
[3:35:06] <%ooblagis> @brickwall35 Nope

[3:35:31] <+Grayhammatter> FeelsBadMan
[3:35:31] <Djinnazz> guess not.
[3:35:32] <%NWR_James> "I'm going to beat S+ by a ton" - @AngriestPat
[3:35:32] <umbracatalyst> Can you smoke plantman?
[3:35:34] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> and about 30 saves more
[3:35:34] <SundarkSoldier> he's also like twenty saves past s+
[3:35:36] <tadaosmad> You live forever, but you gotta eat human shit once a month. Yay or nay?
[3:35:38] <+Maids4lyfe> why does the game have ominous wailing whenever the ivy monster is around BibleThump
[3:35:44] <+C24U> missed a grenade
[3:35:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Saves don't count against rank
[3:35:44] <+天使42199> @majindusto this is true love were making lacF
[3:35:49] <+JEiddew> @tadaosmad sounds like a good deal to me
[3:35:51] <Jaysky> Are you just trying to do hardcore for the fun of it then Pat?
[3:35:52] <ManfredA> we need a more powerful version of speedo X where it's Ricardo X
[3:35:54] <aiyobro> i could see 3 hours but 2:30 is way too short
[3:35:55] <%GohanEgret> @tadaosmad how much and do I get sick

[3:36:11] <%ElenaManetta> Hi!
[3:36:11] <tadaosmad> @GohanEgret No sickness from shit
[3:36:13] <majindusto> What about Racer X?
[3:36:15] <Frostydough> You also cant get S+ if you save more then 2 times
[3:36:20] <%GohanEgret> @tadaosmad load me up
[3:36:21] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @tadaosmad if you've ever flushed a toilet without putting the lid down you've eaten human shit so it's not that bad
[3:36:23] <+xx123manxx> 3 times @Frostydough
[3:36:24] <Djinnazz> 3
[3:36:26] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @Sphincter_Spelunker for s+ it does
[3:36:28] <Frostydough> 3times *
[3:36:29] <tadaosmad> Also, one full block of shit. A solid onw
[3:36:29] <%Kage_96> @Frostydough You can do it 3 times
[3:36:32] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Ayyy I made it
[3:36:32] <+Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:36:33] <+in_spaaace> G3
[3:36:33] <%ooblagis> G3
[3:36:33] <+C24U> G3 since damage matters more for that fight
[3:36:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The "+" does. cmonBruh
[3:36:35] <+Grayhammatter> grenades for the grenade god obviously
[3:36:36] <Djinnazz> G3
[3:36:37] <+krispen_wa> G3
[3:36:37] <+SWFanatic> G6
[3:36:37] <$imextremelymanly> G3
[3:36:38] <+redascendant1> That skin threw me off lmao
[3:36:39] <Fujiwara_92> Tyrant so you can stall him
[3:36:40] <%Plague_Nurse> Tyrant
[3:36:40] <+Sxy_T_Rex> G3 are in Warframe Pat
[3:36:44] <+GradedBinkie> You could just magnum the entire time
[3:36:45] <Nepsotic> deff save the grenades for tyrant
[3:36:46] <Frostydough> Typo i know lol i got S+ today with leon A
[3:36:46] <%Rngiddion> Tyrant is just a timer scam anyway
[3:36:49] <+Maids4lyfe> magnum can also stun tyrant
[3:36:50] <tadaosmad> A chewy block of shit
[3:36:51] <$Hommando> Tyrant is just on a timer
[3:36:51] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> tyrant is an endurance fight isn't it?
[3:36:53] <ArcaneMonk> Tyrant you can just run out time
[3:36:55] <+in_spaaace> Tyrant is time based
[3:36:55] <aaronacmbeckham> DONT IGNORE ME CHAT
[3:36:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[3:36:58] <+GradedBinkie> And mugnum
[3:36:59] <+xx123manxx> no use nades here and magnum on tyrant @AngriestPat
[3:37:00] <%anime_boyz> if you stand in tyrants left arm his cant hit you
[3:37:01] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Grenade for G3 or Tyrant is fine. I'd use on G3. It's best on G4 with claire. He eats shit on the elevator.
[3:37:02] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat just do the speedrun strat and knife G3
[3:37:03] <$imextremelymanly> ya it stuns him
[3:37:06] <%zerocruz> IGNORE HIM
[3:37:08] <%GohanEgret> @aaronacmbeckham WHO SAID THAT
[3:37:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Grenades solve all problems. It's a fact.
[3:37:11] <Djinnazz> just waste what ever you have left/
[3:37:12] <tadaosmad> Garnides and mugnum
[3:37:12] <Fujiwara_92> Tyrant, since it's time based you can stall him with nades @angriestpat
[3:37:12] <crusader_heide> What can u tell us about this room?
[3:37:14] <ArcaneMonk> damage shortens the tyrsant fight, but isnt necesary
[3:37:16] <%ooblagis> Grenade, Shotgun, Grenade, etc.
[3:37:21] <Nepsotic> tyrant will fuck you up if you dont stun him, and damaging him gets the fight over quicker, so save the grenades for tyrant
[3:37:22] <+krispen_wa> Grenade! Tommy Gun! Bikini!
[3:37:22] <+zanzibar_junker> shotgun or Magnum tyrant during insta kill
[3:37:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who's talking
[3:37:25] <%CorvoBrooks> This boss is so cool looking
[3:37:26] <+xx123manxx> or you can magnum this asshole too since you arent using speed strats fuck my no mugnum advice
[3:37:28] <+harryf11> Buttz
[3:37:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Makes him fall off wall and pops all eyeballs. Shortens fight *significantly*
[3:37:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> WOO! Just got my First Chicken Dinner in Apex.
[3:37:37] <+zanzibar_junker> he'll flinch away
[3:37:39] <%ooblagis> Take health
[3:37:40] <SundarkSoldier> @FirearmsInstructor just hucking one flash does that?
[3:37:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Magnum here is best.
[3:37:41] <ManfredA> I somehow got the Tyrant speedkill achievement on my first time
[3:37:50] <%CorvoBrooks> Nice
[3:37:50] <Exicuren> Get fire
[3:37:50] <aaronacmbeckham> my feet stink
[3:37:52] <+ChaosVulpes> What are these magical boxes that store my items and are connected to all other magical boxes? If I had one at home and one in my car, I'd never need to pack ever again for a trip!
[3:37:55] <milk2b> @AngriestPat with tyrant grenades are safe way to interrupt his instakill
[3:37:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @SundarkSoldier Grenade, not flash.
[3:37:56] <majindusto> WHAT? I thought i heard something? Must have just been the wind
[3:38:08] <SundarkSoldier> Ah gotcha
[3:38:09] <ArcaneMonk> @ManfredA same, though. it was my first RE game, too
[3:38:12] <+C24U> Grenades stun tyrant less than a flash grenade does so why waste the potential damage on him instead of G3?
[3:38:13] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat shotgun the eyeballs, then knife G3 in the back until he's out of stunlock. Rinse and Repeat
[3:38:13] <PSI_Guy95> Whose footprints are these? EUGH huhuhuhuhuhu *neck snap noise*
[3:38:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat drop at least 1 stac
[3:38:16] <+xx123manxx> it's easier to just shott his chest than waste nades on tyrant
[3:38:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I also found out that if you fly into the tops of mountains, the game will glitch out and throw you back into the air.
[3:38:20] <+Grayhammatter> that's a lotta magnum
[3:38:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Get MAG and Flamethrower
[3:38:23] <%ooblagis> ???
[3:38:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Yo, Pat has 1,997 viewers right now! Sweet! That's the same year as when CliffyB was ever considered cool!
[3:38:27] <%PlainSimpleTailor> LUL I just read Paige's tweet calling Cliffy B dump water
[3:38:31] <+krispen_wa> Is Lightning Hawk a member of Foxhound?
[3:38:32] <tadaosmad> It's fine, you can kill everything
[3:38:33] <Fujiwara_92> Damage speed Tyrant fight guys
[3:38:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You can *DESTROY* him in record time. Pop pop pop, BURN, repeat, win
[3:38:42] <Fujiwara_92> *speeds
[3:38:53] <%ThirdWelles> @FirearmsInstructor The flamethrower? For G3?
[3:38:53] <Erimos> What's the funnest RE boss for you guys? G3 is close to the top for me, but I also like the extended Krauser battles.
[3:38:53] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Why didnt Annette give Birkin the Devil cure when it was right behind him?
[3:38:54] <+krispen_wa> FLOATING
[3:38:54] <$imextremelymanly> kick Birkin ass
[3:38:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige spends more time on twitter than actually streaming :(

[3:39:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @ThirdWelles YES FT is amazing
[3:39:06] <Ion_LaserX> Them handsLUL
[3:39:06] <Jaysky> Leon your hand is a block
[3:39:09] <mr_ESB> Is pat going gor S+ ?
[3:39:11] <jossahmol> @AngriestPat so you doing claire 2nd?
[3:39:11] <+GradedBinkie> Flame and all Mag
[3:39:12] <+zanzibar_junker> birkin looks akward in that photo
[3:39:14] <+ArcanumMBD> Leon's blocky polygons have more depth than all of Radical Heights
[3:39:17] <+Grayhammatter> he's got them lego hands and feet
[3:39:19] <ManfredA> flames are highly effective on just about every enemy in this game
[3:39:21] <+GradedBinkie> No he is not going for S+
[3:39:23] <Fujiwara_92> no @mr_esb
[3:39:24] <%soulbr4dd4> It's time to kick gum and chew ass! And Pat's all out of ass...
[3:39:26] <mr_ESB> Aww
[3:39:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Shoot each eye with magnum, then IMMEDIATELY unload 200 -300 fuel into him
[3:39:31] <+redascendant1> Did he talk about Cliffy B at all?
[3:39:33] <ArcaneMonk> is it true that using two-space weapons lowers your score?
[3:39:35] <+harryf11> Kill dat bitch birkin
[3:39:35] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat Save your railgun ammo for Gael's second phase
[3:39:38] <%ThirdWelles> S+ is SO far out the window
[3:39:41] <+GradedBinkie> 3 mag and burn
[3:39:51] <$imextremelymanly> just dump on him
[3:39:51] <+Tman451> dump all over him
[3:39:55] <cumurasame> flamethrower is dot so just spray in bursts right?
[3:39:57] <a_mad_dragon> this looks so dumb wth that model
[3:39:58] <+xx123manxx> stun him flame him when he
[3:39:59] <Fujiwara_92> pop, pop, pop, burn, repeat
[3:40:00] <%Plague_Nurse> Knifing him is easier tho
[3:40:00] <$Hommando> You knife him on PC when his chest eyes come out
[3:40:03] <%ThirdWelles> Shit all over him
[3:40:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There's more fuel STRAIGHT AHEAD and right. Circle-strafe him with flamethrower
[3:40:07] <+SWFanatic> its effective against living things
[3:40:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug If you divide that number by 10 apatLiz apatSmug
[3:40:09] <%mayorrev> I really enjoy Birkin's transformation phases
[3:40:10] <Jaysky> That's a choice though
[3:40:10] <PSI_Guy95> OH no! He's losing all his polys!
[3:40:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat shoot LEG, BACK, ARM then BURN
[3:40:12] <SundarkSoldier> "guys should I dump on him?" chat says yes "okay" pat proceeds to miss every shot
[3:40:12] <%mayorrev> Like
[3:40:13] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> 2nd Roughest divorce I've ever seen
[3:40:15] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:40:15] <conflict1914> if only you could unlock that gun
[3:40:16] <Johno_san> GONNA CRY?
[3:40:22] <+xx123manxx> flame him whens he's down and when he turns into sicko mode all red and shit just nade him to death
[3:40:23] <$waltzqueen> beautiful lady and then LEON
[3:40:23] <%anusholeboner> oh my god the stupid Leon model
[3:40:23] <Taffer85> why LUl
[3:40:24] <tadaosmad> Because it's obviously a human, chris
[3:40:24] <+DeeJayOkay> this skin is literally the fucking best
[3:40:24] <%mayorrev> his original head is in his chest now, thats hardcore
[3:40:26] <daisymaisy02> Leon as a blockman in this cutscene is the absolute best
[3:40:28] <+C24U> @AngriestPat The cure is RIGHT BEHIND Birkin why didn't she just cure him!?
[3:40:29] <ArcaneMonk> emotionless block face
[3:40:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dumb bitch
[3:40:31] <$imextremelymanly> leon is not impressed
[3:40:36] <$RageKingDomo> why are u playing this again lol
[3:40:38] <+Grayhammatter> this is the best
[3:40:38] <tadaosmad> Jesus fucking chris there's a fucking human head
[3:40:39] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Man, the facial animation on Leon is stellar
[3:40:40] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @time_puncher and then divide that by 10. 19 people played radical heights.
[3:40:40] <+zanzibar_junker> g virus is so shit compared to t
[3:40:41] <dekkitout> Leon: "U wot?"
[3:40:41] <PSI_Guy95> "IT'S UMBRELLA'S FAULT" "but ur umbrella" "WE DIDN'T MEAN TO THO"
[3:40:41] <%skizzuto> you said that last playthrough too lol
[3:40:43] <Mr_Taters > @ArcaneMonk It does not, only using infinite ammo weapons and saving prevent getting an S+ (apparently the knife is okay though)
[3:40:44] <ManfredA> @conflict1914 should've been Claire's b-route gun
[3:40:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat When you shoot his leg, he staggers forward, aim for where is head is usually and pop his exposed eye from the FRONT
[3:40:46] <SundarkSoldier> @Johno_san devil may cry? maybe piss his pants? devil may shit and cum?
[3:40:47] <%mayorrev> TELL POLYGON MAN
[3:40:48] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i never understood why is annette fucked up in this cutscene
[3:40:48] <%SrG00SE> sounds like an excuse cliffy b would make
[3:40:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can hear the Frank West

[3:40:55] <+SWFanatic> arise chicken, arise
[3:40:56] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Pat is this gonna be the last playthrough for you? Can we not just nuke RC already
[3:40:56] <+Ell1ot> mine is, "Ada, Wait!"
[3:40:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> No wonder Claire is splooshing all over the place. Look at Leon he's all... polygonal.
[3:40:57] <Ion_LaserX> Leon: BITCH R U FO REAL
[3:41:00] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Devil is right behind him just use it on him now!
[3:41:01] <%anusholeboner> thats a really short plunger
[3:41:01] <goddamndavid> Pat do you get mad at the makers of the gun or the person who shot???
[3:41:04] <+天使42199> william :(
[3:41:04] <lols_royce> i want to know about whatever other corporation is turning humans into roblox characters
[3:41:04] <a_mad_dragon> i want to see someone with a papercraft cosplay of low-poly leon
[3:41:05] <%CorvoBrooks> what a baby
[3:41:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Leon is so dumb that he circled back around to being smart in this ONE instance.
[3:41:08] <dragoon001914> He got shot in center mass fucking six times
[3:41:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug 19 people had a gun to their head

[3:41:20] <+Sxy_T_Rex> On PC if you can get your game up to 1000 fps the knife can the fabric of reality and you can just leap to the credits
[3:41:20] <Fujiwara_92> YOU'LL NEVER GET THE G VIRUS BabyRage l
[3:41:20] <hlreiku> Its like a halloween mask
[3:41:21] <%mayorrev> I like how he injected it into the right side of his chest and now his right arm is huge

[3:41:24] <%mercado94> oh no~
[3:41:25] <%soulbr4dd4> Well if you wanna get technical. It's actually Capcom's fault. They shouldn't have made this scenario :D
[3:41:27] <fluqqer3d> never inject gatorade, eses
[3:41:28] <$Hommando> I want a mod that gives everyone Alita Battle Angel eyes.

[3:41:37] <goddamndavid> @SundarkSoldier the real answer
[3:41:37] <%ooblagis> We only intended this to happen in OTHER countries. With THOSE people
[3:41:37] <%CorvoBrooks> ouch
[3:41:38] <+krispen_wa> I really like the Claire A version of this more. Claire going "LEAVE JIREN TO ME" is so much cooler
[3:41:39] <Johno_san> @SundarkSoldier HAHA
[3:41:41] <%RCtiger0> I just like how it cuts to his polygon face
[3:41:41] <antthefool> SQUEEZE THAT BITCH
[3:41:43] <Jaysky> WHAT the-- ?
[3:41:43] <dekkitout> Hmm, die of bullet trauma, G-Virus... die of bullet trauma or G-Virus, I'll take 1 bullet trauma, please
[3:41:44] <conflict1914> killing his wife was the requirement he needed to evolve
[3:41:45] <tadaosmad> Oh brother
[3:41:46] <+countgaculatv> Jesus Annette got rocked
[3:41:46] <+G_Thunders> “We killed all those orphans but THIS is too much!”

[3:41:53] <%mayorrev> I want an action figure of birkin complete with transforming mutant action
[3:41:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Gruhunchously)
[3:41:58] <%anusholeboner> The women of Resident Evil are consistently cooler than the dudes, its canon
[3:41:59] <%SrG00SE> maybe they were just a husband and wife witha crazy hentai tentacle fetish
[3:42:00] <Erimos> This is fine Kappa
[3:42:00] <+ChaosVulpes> Suffer like G did
[3:42:01] <+Lillowh> Where's the lava
[3:42:02] <+C24U> Leon snaps his leg on the drop

[3:42:04] <tadaosmad> WE DO IT
[3:42:04] <+天使42199> LUL SHE FORCED YOU TO FIGHT
[3:42:06] <+ArcanumMBD> I love the contrast in this scene between Leon and Claire. Leon gets forced into it, Claire is a fucking badass
[3:42:06] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @time_puncher as many people played radical heights as the amount of severance pay cliffy b gave his employees
[3:42:08] <ManfredA> I love how in Claire's route this is Claire stepping up to the plate and in Leon's she's forcing you
[3:42:09] <Johno_san> @AngriestPat GIVE HIM AN ASS WHIPPIN'!
[3:42:09] <%CorvoBrooks> So cool
[3:42:11] <+redascendant1> skyOH skyOH skyOH skyOH skyOH skyOH

[3:46:50] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Annette wouldn't have been in that spot if she had just cured William with Devil that was in the same room when he used the G-Virus on himself
[3:46:50] <DrMoose7> stone face
[3:46:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You just met her, Leon
[3:46:51] <%jiin6> Leon use your brain
[3:46:51] <SundarkSoldier> this whole game I was like wait why did they change ada into an fbi agent
[3:46:52] <+BorinCorran> Leon is even more of a goof with that face.

[3:47:07] <Huntercd> Annette deserves worse
[3:47:08] <neooneshin> why do you hoard? i stopped wasting time going after items in games
[3:47:13] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat "I only have enough recources to kill X five times over. I'm worried I have too little."
[3:47:15] <%connos_livereview> now i will faux die
[3:47:15] <%jiin6> Leon: you mean future Ada Kennedy?
[3:47:15] <%soulbr4dd4> but my polygon dick though...!!
[3:47:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Do we ever hear about of the G-virus after this game?
[3:47:23] <+ChaosVulpes> I'm dying and have nothing to lose, but maybe I'm lying!
[3:47:24] <$imextremelymanly> yep
[3:47:26] <Taffer85> annette didn't have the pendant Kappa
[3:47:27] <wydamn> *dies* If it gets into the wrong hands, then what!?! *shakes corpse* THEN WHAT!?!
[3:47:28] <%connos_livereview> gg writers
[3:47:28] <%Keyd00d> oops
[3:47:29] <majindusto> The SELF DESTRUCT sequence has been activated, I repeat the SELF DESTRUCT sequence has been activated...This sequence may not be Aborted!
[3:47:30] <%jiin6> BUT SHE DYING
[3:47:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> She was in shock i guess
[3:47:30] <%SrG00SE> really true
[3:47:32] <+ArcanumMBD> THERE WAS NO TIME
[3:47:32] <Ultimatefool> No sssshhhhh that's not true
[3:47:32] <dekkitout> Wait- EWHAT?!
[3:47:34] <+chronopaladin> the g virus cure is my creation!
[3:47:34] <Jaysky> She wanted him dead lets be real
[3:47:34] <SundarkSoldier> @ThirdWelles he's called Mr. X not Mr. V so obviously he needs twice as much as five
[3:47:34] <robbtre> "But she's the only one to kiss my stupid polygon face"
[3:47:35] <antthefool> Rigamortis setting in girl.
[3:47:36] <Shadicara> Leon is the only one sane enough to go wait maybe she is a bitch Kappa
[3:47:36] <Caidezes> The pendant, Pat.
[3:47:38] <%ooblagis> Mmmmmaybe it's locked?
[3:47:38] <%jiin6> how the fuck she getting Up
[3:47:38] <neooneshin> but he would die
[3:47:41] <%Aztec50> yeah but William is preeeeetty far gone
[3:47:41] <disister1201> pat has enough ammo to beat the game over again lol
[3:47:41] <+GradedBinkie> But why do that when you can become a cool MONSTAR
[3:47:43] <%mastertwin2> There's NO time!
[3:47:43] <Johno_san> would it be better if leons mouth opened and closed like a chirping bird for dialouge with this skin?
[3:47:45] <goddamndavid> theres a cure for the G-virus??
[3:47:46] <antthefool> The shit is flowing
[3:47:46] <%Plague_Nurse> he would not die
[3:47:48] <$nademonkey1100> SHHHHHHHHH
[3:47:48] <+JackMillerTime> @angriestpat but he'll bleed to death
[3:47:49] <%PlaneWalkerDavid> Science though
[3:47:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat He would die then
[3:47:50] <%IDTheftVictim> Would that kill him?
[3:47:52] <Ion_LaserX> Capcom: Gonna have to fix that plot hole in the remake to this remake
[3:47:52] <%ThirdWelles> @SundarkSoldier Ah, shit, you're right
[3:47:53] <vernardohunk93> thats not true, what is there is the cure for the EMBRYO infection
[3:47:53] <Skullcrush04> If she cured him on the spot, wouldn't he succumb to his bullet wounds?
[3:47:53] <%SrG00SE> no he means AS HE INJECTS HIMSELF in the flashback
[3:47:54] <ntr_nakadashi> Maybe Annette wanted data or something
[3:47:54] <Plague_bagel> she also wanted to see the results tho
[3:47:56] <CalderGaming> you could argue that she was overwhelmed with curiosity about what would happen
[3:47:56] <Grennold> I thought DEVIL just killed off G embryos
[3:47:56] <+C24U> It wasn't locked since he took the virus out of the same spot
[3:47:56] <Djinnazz> there a reason you're saving all those herbs?
[3:47:57] <%AdmiralButtloaf> she wasnt dying earlier tho lol
[3:47:57] <WaxWitch> she wanted a monster husband, i guess
[3:47:57] <+天使42199> @goddamndavid yes you have to cure sherry
[3:47:59] <$imextremelymanly> it was his creation she did not want to interfere
[3:47:59] <%CorvoBrooks> We already know they are not the smartest people
[3:48:00] <+iamwood99> yea but shut up tho
[3:48:03] <dreu81> Would it even work at that stage in the mutation?
[3:48:03] <CrypticMochi> Sherry had the pendant though
[3:48:03] <%DeathsDoom> would he then die of bullet wounds or get nice healy powers like sherry
[3:48:04] <Erimos> It's not that simple Pat. She lost her key Kappa
[3:48:04] <$eldrich_horror> she let it happen for science
[3:48:04] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> The G virus has some serious flaws. It apparently had zero testing
[3:48:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat your item box GP is the reason the explosion is so massive. It's normally only enough to explode the West lab, but because of you it takes out the WHOLE BUILDING
[3:48:06] <Fujiwara_92> GRAB FLASH NADES
[3:48:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:48:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @goddamndavid Sherry is infected in Claire's run
[3:48:08] <+lana_____> my husband is turning into a zombie right inf ront of me lemme just have a clear head LUL
[3:48:09] <+GradedBinkie> Time for Mugnum
[3:48:10] <+G_Thunders> He had like 10 bullets in him
[3:48:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> One could argue that Annette was fascinated by Will's transformation and decided NOT to cure him
[3:48:11] <%valriot> Is ammo a limited buff
[3:48:13] <%SrG00SE> yeah but its fine if he dies to the bullet wounds they all already know it was a mistake
[3:48:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If William was smart how come he died?
[3:48:18] <+countgaculatv> Maybe she had to synthesize it after Birkin left in hope that she could cure him later. But he was too far gone.
[3:48:18] <%ThirdWelles> G WAS HIS CREATION
[3:48:21] <ManfredA> don't they state that you can only be cured if you're not too far gone
[3:48:23] <CalderGaming> you even see her incredibly distracted by examining G's path of destruction in Claire's story
[3:48:25] <+Jayoflavius> leave room for elevator battery
[3:48:27] <xeros720> i can vouch for the fact that scientists can be fuckin dumb if it isn't about their area of study
[3:48:27] <SundarkSoldier> @FirearmsInstructor does the explosion happen at one box or do they all explode?
[3:48:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She wanted a divorce
[3:48:29] <goddamndavid> @天使42199 @Sphincter_Spelunker oh right im a fucking moron lmao
[3:48:30] <%Mendin> I'm wondering if DEVIL is a vaccine against G-PARASITE infestation and not necessarily the virus proper since it needs direct injection to work?
[3:48:31] <Shadicara> Nothing cures getting sprayed with a machine gun pat
[3:48:31] <+iamwood99> you cannot outsmart bullet
[3:48:32] <ThorW> @AngriestPat Another fun plot hole is Hunk's team confirming Birkin is dead and then him getting up to inject himself
[3:48:33] <Parapattern> "Imagine if the G-Virus got into the hands of people who released it into a major metropolitan area!"
[3:48:36] <Ion_LaserX> Annette really wanted the G
[3:48:36] <+xx123manxx> She didn't kill him because she was a coward and curing him would also cause him to die on account of him being shot 30 times @AngriestPat
[3:48:39] <Fujiwara_92> YOU'LL NEVER GET THE G VIRUS BabyRage l
[3:48:43] <HairballCT> Keepo
[3:48:45] <waterstealer> you miseed an item
[3:48:45] <+verelme> Pat meant when he was first infected
[3:48:46] <%snow_bush> Welp, time to sleep. Night all
[3:48:49] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat It was explained that she has an eyeball fetish and that prevented her from curing him
[3:48:50] <%connos_livereview> youll never get the Geeeee
[3:48:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThorW he was playing possum
[3:48:51] <ArcaneMonk> GTHERE'S THE BITCH
[3:48:53] <CalderGaming> THAT'S a plot hole
[3:48:54] <+SWFanatic> WutFace
[3:48:55] <$imextremelymanly> somewhere Ghost is sulking around downstairs
[3:48:55] <Onamar> Hunk is just incompetent
[3:48:58] <%Plague_Nurse> No she didn't cure him cause she's dumb
[3:49:04] <%ooblagis> Well he did get shot like 8 times
[3:49:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Its HER telling the story
[3:49:06] <thetruenicster> but wasnt teh G Antiviral locked away and the key was with Sherry, and not Annette?
[3:49:07] <Djinnazz> that's not a plot holw, they thought he was dead.
[3:49:07] <+RC_S3kshun8> @Jesus_X_Boredom If you read the documents you find they tested the shit out of it, actually. Even had family members and married folks where the infected one was trying to hold out from hurting their loved ones and eventually just implanted them anyway
[3:49:08] <%CorvoBrooks> This part is so good
[3:49:08] <+timblenaut> ada LOVES the polygons

[3:49:12] <Shadicara> I was just thinking about how I don't trust you at all
[3:49:12] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Dude shruged off a dozen bullets
[3:49:12] <vernardohunk93> @AngriestPat wasant the cure for the embryo infection, not the G itself?
[3:49:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It was Martinez' fault
[3:49:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat Hunk's squad also wanted to save bullets
[3:49:14] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Maybe Annette did inject him but messed up and it hit his wallet
[3:49:14] <Taffer85> HUNK couldn't feel a pulse through his gloves anyways
[3:49:14] <+secretspud> that outfit is dumb, I love it
[3:49:15] <dekkitout> Keep it in your pants, Kennedy!
[3:49:17] <%jiin6> hey look the Self Destruct is going to kill every one? why cure him?

[3:49:34] <ntr_nakadashi> Then again didn't UBCS shoot the hell out of Birkin? So he injected himself cos he was gonna die anyway

[3:52:13] <%Gogogolem> Ada was faking
[3:52:13] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat if she has the grappling hook, why doesn't she just grapple away while hanging from leon?
[3:52:13] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> was Annette just another chris spy ?
[3:52:13] <+lana_____> HOW would a grapple hook stop your momentum her ARMS WOULD RIP OFF LUL
[3:52:14] <wydamn> I'd rather imagine she waited and then thought "Oh nobody's going to shoot, I guess I better shoot."
[3:52:14] <%Prism_Wing> And now you know why the high ground matters!
[3:52:14] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> That hoe Ada does whatever she can to no be, boo'd up lol
[3:52:14] <crusader_heide> A grappling hook at that speed would tear her arm off
[3:52:15] <%jiin6> She Curve Physics, cause Scientist
[3:52:15] <%GohanEgret> Theme of Waiting Ada
[3:52:16] <andrewweihl> what difficulty? @AngriestPat
[3:52:17] <%ThirdWelles> and the platform Annette is on is pretty wide
[3:52:18] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat except once she hits terminal velocity, the sudden grapple hook's deceleration RIPS her arm out of it's socket
[3:52:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat She has clear line of sight, but Ada's blinder than Paige for not noticing Annette appear or AIMING for her.
[3:52:19] <Erimos> She ricochetted the bullet like revolver ocelotte LUL
[3:52:19] <tadaosmad> My dick is so huge right now
[3:52:20] <+ArcanumMBD> I like how Pat has more resources than he can POSSIBLY bring into the final fight
[3:52:20] <+redascendant1> Leon's facial expression is the exact same as Steve's in the background
[3:52:21] <+antkowiak1> the power of the high ground
[3:52:22] <ManfredA> @ZaikTorek yep, Ghost's mission is actually canon
[3:52:23] <%valriot> Pretty good shot using one arm and FUCKIN 1 SECOND FROM DEATH
[3:52:24] <Shadicara> We need a RE 4 remake now
[3:52:24] <%madhattergay> mmm wacha saaaay
[3:52:24] <%JJCheeker> No it's like in the movie wanted she curved the bullet
[3:52:25] <ZephynM> I mean Annette is the big dummy, I love you Pat
[3:52:26] <NarcissistCactus> g forces don't exist in the re universe
[3:52:27] <%machshop> heat the key
[3:52:27] <%soulbr4dd4> No Leon, non-polygonal women are a LIE!!
[3:52:29] <%Kiwami_gaim> Not gonna lie maybe i should cosplay polygon leon for magfest next year
[3:52:29] <%ooblagis> Like, you never activate a self destruct, so why does on happen?
[3:52:29] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> That's a crazy reactor
[3:52:30] <+ChaosVulpes> How did they even manage to BUILD ALL THIS SHIT in the first place!?!?!
[3:52:31] <Huntercd> Ada gives it to Wesker just like the plaga
[3:52:34] <+secretspud> Time to suffer like G Did.
[3:52:37] <D3rrtyD4n> how much ammo you got?
[3:52:38] <%Starlight_Gamer> the power core still looks sinister
[3:52:39] <$shurtal> when the camera cuts to where annette is standing, you can see that there's BARELY enough room for the shot to happen, but more likely she was aiming for leon's head and misses, hitting ada instead
[3:52:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Spy strats
[3:52:41] <NoirePanzer> Pat brings the entire box with him to the fight
[3:52:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ever put on the Adam West costume in Arkham 3 ending? the mask is hilarious
[3:52:41] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat How did Ada not see Annette if she was standing directly behind Leon then?
[3:52:43] <jossahmol> doesnot work that way
[3:52:43] <%SrG00SE> ya but again, she didnt use a grappling hook. she landed on my face.
[3:52:44] <$imextremelymanly> i dont know about that pat
[3:52:46] <%Mendin> spodermada
[3:52:46] <%connos_livereview> games dont care
[3:52:46] <%gnarly_memes_bro> TO WHERE PAT?
[3:52:47] <dekkitout> Also, because fiction
[3:52:47] <NumbusPlays> Oh yeah you're right that *does* solve everything
[3:52:47] <%jiin6> Look she has Plot Armor
[3:52:48] <tadaosmad> It's perfectly possible.
[3:52:48] <+lana_____> yeah lemme just stop all this momentum by swinging right
[3:52:49] <%madhattergay> suffer like g did
[3:52:49] <%anusholeboner> @lana_____ cmon man, as if it wouldnt slowly tense up, the chinese thought of that!
[3:52:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat From the arm that just got shot? :D
[3:52:50] <%Corporate_Redeemer> No he arm would've still been torn off
[3:52:50] <hlreiku> I miss the robotic voice
[3:52:50] <%sourceofall> even worst batman is still batman
[3:52:51] <%YaBoiShamoi> When does Annette Birkin actually die?
[3:52:53] <%Das_Bass> this is RE fuck real world rules
[3:52:54] <TheyCallMeVawn> Also RE main characters dont die
[3:52:54] <+GradedBinkie> Was G virus only in RE2?
[3:52:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> ada is secretly Peter Parker
[3:52:57] <wydamn> Grappling hook in her little choker collar thing.
[3:52:58] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat she's a super spy like I'm the queen of England
[3:52:58] <+Tiewolf> Skip
[3:53:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> or at least had her arm snap
[3:53:02] <tadaosmad> She a good girl
[3:53:04] <%ElenaManetta> Ada was lost in Leon's dreamy eyes
[3:53:04] <A_Zealous_Retort> or grappling hook had some give/springiness so it was a bungie type thing
[3:53:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WAIFU
[3:53:06] <Marpolo13> polygon man!
[3:53:07] <NumbusPlays> claire isn't blocky?
[3:53:08] <+chronopaladin> she was hiding behind leon's huge naive head
[3:53:09] <%AdmiralButtloaf> she was lost in leons eyees
[3:53:11] <%JJCheeker> She's not polygone
[3:53:11] <%madhattergay> hey claire
[3:53:12] <%anusholeboner> yall act like the hook wouldnt slow her down first like wall climbing hitches
[3:53:12] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Tunnel vision on sexy Leon
[3:53:13] <%GohanEgret> LEON PLEASE - chris
[3:53:13] <%Gogogolem> she was distracted by leons hot blocky body obviously
[3:53:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Square peg in round hole, Leon.
[3:53:14] <%ThirdWelles> She was too focused on Leon's beautiful emotive face
[3:53:14] <DaHaLoJeDi> LEOOOOON - Chris Redfield
[3:53:14] <Darren716> BOO REAL MODEL
[3:53:15] <%salty_syd913> why isnt claire blocky
[3:53:16] <+天使42199> fuck my sister leon Kreygasm
[3:53:16] <Gruhunchously> Claire, you're looking mighty high res over there.
[3:53:16] <%CorvoBrooks> Leon is to beautiful
[3:53:16] <HorribleHog> she only had eyes for LEOOON UGUU laeUGU
[3:53:17] <goddamndavid> how could she focus on anything but Leon's beautiful 6 polygod head???
[3:53:17] <%Trabnaxes> Blocky Claire Next
[3:53:17] <+Grayhammatter> why isn't claire blocky?
[3:53:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LEON PLEASE!
[3:53:17] <+SWFanatic> leon, your face is flat
[3:53:18] <+C24U> Too busy looking in Leon's beautiful face
[3:53:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Are you kidding? Ada's arm strength and ligaments are strong as fuck. How else would she be able to throw RPG's to Leon all the time
[3:53:19] <jossahmol> cuz ada was gazing in leons dreamy eyes
[3:53:21] <+antkowiak1> just fuck his blocky ass
[3:53:21] <neooneshin> It's ok, Leon gets his side ho
[3:53:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHE ISN'T POLYGON!
[3:53:22] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat Don't you hit me with your parabolic logic
[3:53:22] <%DeathsDoom> if your already falling the line would still pull the fuck out of your arm
[3:53:22] <%mayorrev> claire you have your polygons back!
[3:53:23] <NoirePanzer> LEON PLEASE
[3:53:23] <+MechaBaphomet> blinded by love duhh
[3:53:24] <%Prism_Wing> Wesker teleports via grappling hook Kappa
[3:53:24] <VanLynx> OBVIOUSLY she was lost in Leon's polygonal eyes
[3:53:25] <Enryuan> Ada was too foucused on those leon poly
[3:53:27] <%connos_livereview> boo lara croft
[3:53:27] <crusader_heide> Because Ada was gazing into Leon's pixelized eyes
[3:53:27] <+Ell1ot> how come Claire isnt blocky?
[3:53:27] <Ion_LaserX> Chris: THINK ABOUT THE BLOODLINE LEON
[3:53:27] <+G_Thunders> She was looking into Leon’s dreamy eyes, duh
[3:53:29] <+BorinCorran> Ada was too distracted by how smexy leon's polygon face is.
[3:53:29] <dekkitout> WTF is wrong with Claire, she's not poly-person
[3:53:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> whos that???
[3:53:31] <VritraReiRei> 3D CLAIR DansGame
[3:53:31] <Valdorick> Boo! Not a Polygon!
[3:53:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@majindusto) (warning)
[3:53:33] <Ryansmoothies> is this leon a mod or unlockable?
[3:53:34] <+BroLASco> leon had dreamy eyes
[3:53:34] <+thelastpaleemperor> I'm upset that "IT WORKED!" didn't make it into the remake, in the same way I'm sad that Jill Sandwich isn't in RE1 remake
[3:53:35] <wydamn> I'm disappointed Claire's not a polygonal monster in the video feed.
[3:53:36] <+PhysicsLB> Leon, you
[3:53:36] <D3rrtyD4n> oh boy this looks dumb
[3:53:36] <tadaosmad> The way out is through my legs Leon
[3:53:36] <%jiin6> ADA has the plot Armor
[3:53:36] <%valriot> LEON PLEASE
[3:53:36] <gamezerox> She didn't see Anette because of that beautiful Leon blocky face
[3:53:36] <$Falilth> why doesn't leon scream "we?"
[3:53:37] <%ThirdWelles> God I love this track
[3:53:38] <$Hommando> Asian drivers am I right? Ada did crash the only working vehicle in the game post intro.
[3:53:38] <%ElenaManetta> I want a dramatic zoom into Leon's face.
[3:53:39] <+PhysicsLB> re breaking up...with ada
[3:53:40] <%Das_Bass> she's not a polly
[3:53:40] <%InsaneJackLondon> The Scene lies, Claires blockyer than that
[3:53:41] <+chronopaladin> leon WE'RE breaking up
[3:53:41] <%IDTheftVictim> We will have half polygonal babies DON'T YOU WANNA SEE
[3:53:43] <cumurasame> I will die on the Umbrella darkside Chronicles Hill, Ada somehow survived teh fall and then got the grapple hook after this gameeee
[3:53:44] <%connos_livereview> this track is good
[3:53:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> That Ada Disguised as Clare!
[3:53:45] <ZephynM> This music is great.
[3:53:47] <%Starlight_Gamer> is this leon a or b?
[3:53:47] <%ThePuddingDead> Come aboard! And bring aloooooong-
[3:53:49] <LeeOhX> can you believe these two have been running around the same police station at the same time and NEVER bump into each other
[3:53:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> behind u
[3:53:52] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, a knife
[3:53:52] <$MightyMaxT> I think this scene might be why Claire's classic costume isn't the compression shirt @AngriestPat
[3:53:53] <Erimos> Claire: Leon, my parents aren't home. Come quick Kappa
[3:53:53] <%SrG00SE> Chris is calling in,"Dude have you SEEN my sister's tanktop?"
[3:53:54] <%jiin6> PAT the Locker
[3:53:54] <%Keyd00d> you missed the spray
[3:53:55] <HorribleHog> He I mean me I mean she was looking into Liam's I mean Leon's eyes
[3:53:57] <+xx123manxx> Sherry and Leon have NOTHING in this game now LUL
[3:53:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> claire, if we don't make it I just want you to know.... I don't find you attractive.
[3:53:58] <%Prism_Wing> poly lifestyle isn't for everyone.
[3:53:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the first aid
[3:54:00] <%Aztec50> what is a Marshaling Yard?
[3:54:00] <$waltzqueen> @Hommando thats in extremely poor taste dude
[3:54:00] <+BorinCorran> They never show the Claire skin you picked in that scene btw.
[3:54:01] <Plague_bagel> this music Kreygasm
[3:54:01] <DatAsuna> I wish this game had more than 3 songs of note
[3:54:02] <+Tiewolf> The cam for Claire is HD thus why she does not look like her old self
[3:54:04] <Valdorick> !Speed Run At Risk!
[3:54:06] <%JJCheeker> You only see her that one time
[3:54:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 🎻

[3:54:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat no, box it
[3:54:35] <%JJCheeker> It's no hunk music but it's pretty good
[3:54:35] <%weissguard> This music is Kreygasm worthy. And then that BOSS THEME THOOOO
[3:54:36] <+天使42199> @DatAsuna Unfortunately when games go for atmospheric soundtracks the songs end up sucking. This game is great with the oriinal music tho
[3:54:36] <%Laecerelius> I’m missing items I won’t use! Noooooooo!!
[3:54:37] <+xx123manxx> Darkside Chronicles Claire mod > Every other Claire skin
[3:54:37] <lols_royce> why do self destruct timers all set off micro explosions before the main event?
[3:54:38] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Maybe Ada let herself get shot to trick Leon??? coxBut
[3:54:38] <+Ell1ot> Claire needs her Ada wig
[3:54:38] <%Shillk> sound's like hunk's theme
[3:54:40] <%Das_Bass> finish your thought

[3:56:16] <xeros720> right in my polygons
[3:56:19] <Plague_bagel> wait, is what leon says a meta dmx reference? 🤔
[3:56:20] <%SrG00SE> you have a lot of those
[3:56:20] <+thelastpaleemperor> I wish there was a full 98 DLC that retextured the game in polygons and gave it fixed camera angles
[3:56:22] <PSI_Guy95> At this point I'm not hearing X Gon Giv It To Ya, I'm hearing the opening to Friday Night Fisticuffs as Woolie welcomes you in
[3:56:22] <+Grayhammatter> that just barely misses his arm
[3:56:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I wish they made a skin where you can play that fugly CG model from the ps1 cutscenes
[3:56:26] <Erimos> It's a good one
[3:56:26] <andrewweihl> @AngriestPat too bad you can play as Mr. X - pounding down the zombies lol

[3:56:28] <+linSP> leon's seen better days

[4:00:43] <ThorW> @AngriestPat you can stop his charge by shotgunning his chest twice. Or keep a grenade, either way
[4:00:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you can stun him with the magnum during the OHKO LUL LUL

[4:00:46] <%mercado94> Why would you trust us?
[4:00:46] <tank7013> You can shoot him out of that charge too
[4:00:47] <%Fluxraw> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong

[4:00:51] <+Name_Meme> You can, but
[4:00:51] <%DeathsDoom> you did
[4:00:51] <garbageheaphound> well that was a fucking lie
[4:00:51] <+Capseetra> you can stun him to avoid that attack tho

[4:00:52] <%dashonjb1994> Elmo quick distract him apatPorgmo
[4:00:52] <KeystoneA1> Except you have to actually SHOOT THE GUN when he does that attack
[4:00:52] <%PlainSimpleTailor> NOBODY STEALS CRAZY TALK
[4:00:52] <$imextremelymanly> i blame all of you
[4:00:53] <+Judeknight> Flash grenades stun him and prevent him from doing that one shot attack
[4:00:53] <+conradical> you had him in a stun lock but you stopped throwing grenades

[4:00:55] <+Jesus_X_Boredom> Mr. X gives the woist hugs

[4:00:56] <%HyperCharge_Sam> I mean, they were technically right
[4:00:56] <Frostydough> Just dodge 4head#
[4:00:57] <+iamwood99> it really be like that sometimes
[4:00:57] <pede2011> I mean, with enough nades and flashes, maybe
[4:00:57] <tungstenviper> YES
[4:00:58] <majindusto> And you listened
[4:00:59] <+ChaosVulpes> Just play how you want to. Stop listening to us.
[4:00:59] <%CorvoBrooks> That was bad advice
[4:01:00] <+WilderWolfMan> woolie are you lying again
[4:01:00] <AntChodeny> Should've picked up that file.
[4:01:01] <Erimos> Just Royal Guard the attacks Kappa
[4:01:01] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat "just have more grenades haduurrrrrrrrr"
[4:01:02] <+Eddy21forsaken> it was cliffy and his alt twitter account

[4:01:07] <D3rrtyD4n> HOW MUCH DID HE PAY YOU?
[4:01:08] <+gael_jebidibah> Didn't you literally just stunlock him?
[4:01:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pack some flashes
[4:01:10] <%DeathsDoom> Also if you shot him the charge probably would have stopped
[4:01:11] <%DedlokPM> But he may need those grenades later! apatWhat
[4:01:12] <+thelastpaleemperor> YOU GOT BLESZINSKI'D
[4:01:12] <squirtkitten> I'll be honest its super great seeing Pat so fully enjoy and play RE2make as much as he did RE2

[4:01:13] <+zanzibar_junker> the I stakill
[4:01:14] <+Grayhammatter> should've opened the locker
[4:01:15] <+redascendant1> Caustic is fucking garbage for everything but blocking doors and countering other caustics
[4:01:19] <+secretspud> crunchy crunchy mr X
[4:01:19] <%anime_boyz> i hear that you can stand inside of x's left arm and his attacks wont hit ya if you cling to it like a baby
[4:01:20] <%Kaneis> Real talk; did Pat combat Cliffy B's alt account or was that just some convenient rando
[4:01:21] <Canti58> pro strats, just stand as close to his left arm as much as you can, he will always miss
[4:01:23] <tri3dgE027> You actually did it already. If you shot him on that attack, its Rocket Launcher already
[4:01:23] <%ThirdWelles> Never listen to anyone in this fucking shitstorm of a chat
[4:01:26] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you just need more grenades
[4:01:27] <Jaysky> No Leon
[4:01:31] <Fujiwara_92> YOU CAN THO, JUST CHUCK MORE NADES l
[4:01:33] <+countgaculatv> @angriestpat use the shotgun on his charge move
[4:01:34] <%Mendin> Oh man I didnt notice he comes down with the superman pose
[4:01:35] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat Just use the buckler it has more iframes
[4:01:37] <%connos_livereview> shoot him in the heart when he charges you bogan
[4:01:37] <+xx123manxx> You cannot dodge the insta kill unless you bait it into a rock, just shotty his chest to stop him
[4:01:43] <%ThirdWelles> WHAT DO YOU MEAN
[4:01:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls Always reads the bad advice SourPls
[4:01:46] <Ryansmoothies> rando zombie lul
[4:01:48] <%mercado94> just punch him Kappa
[4:01:53] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat You had plenty of ammo
[4:01:55] <%ooblagis> You didn't dump it all, you probably had enough
[4:01:58] <gordieda20> I'm pretty sure you had enough
[4:01:59] <tadaosmad> That was super fast.
[4:01:59] <+天使42199> @ThirdWelles ShitStorm 8 is THE CHAT
[4:02:01] <%ThirdWelles> You just listened to a dummy
[4:02:02] <$imextremelymanly> just shoot him once in the heart with the magmum to stun him when he's doing his insta kill move
[4:02:03] <hntronium> Don't listen to chat, especially when chat is telling you not to listen to chat
[4:02:07] <%Das_Bass> just parry him
[4:02:10] <%ThirdWelles> You're fine
[4:02:10] <stropbopadopolis> just dont get hit
[4:02:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Flamethrower works really well here, as well.

[4:02:13] <+kolen4566> Use a blue herb now
[4:02:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat but this setup is badass
[4:02:17] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you will be fine
[4:02:17] <$RageKingDomo> why wont he just use his stockpiled items
[4:02:18] <%ThirdWelles> Just don't listen to dumb people
[4:02:19] <%Plague_Nurse> Flash, Pat
[4:02:20] <+GradedBinkie> headshots if you can
[4:02:23] <$RageKingDomo> its the end u psychopath
[4:02:23] <+Tiewolf> !timer
[4:02:25] <tri3dgE027> The Drag-Claw attack of the Tyrant means you're done. You need to shot him to cancel that attack (it cannot be dodged or interuppted with Flash / Grenade)
[4:02:25] <+thelastpaleemperor> Petition to make the term for getting tricked by a bullshit comment "Getting Bleszinski'd"
[4:02:26] <+iamwood99> use royal guard for the fight

[4:02:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 2m.
[4:02:29] <$imextremelymanly> Pound him with your bullets
[4:02:31] <disister1201> you don't have to exit the box to combine stuff
[4:02:31] <%CorvoBrooks> You got this Pat
[4:02:32] <+xx123manxx> As far as I know this fight is semi-time locked
[4:02:34] <%Trabnaxes> You could grate cheese on those elbows
[4:02:36] <ScreamingMeat> Those plugs seems so pointless
[4:02:38] <NoirePanzer> Guessing the guy meant stun when he charges for the OHKO but idk
[4:02:40] <%Fenlig> you should try stun lock him with granades pat
[4:02:42] <%Aztec50> just use the grenades to get him out of charge
[4:02:44] <ThorW> @tri3dgE027 It can be interrupted by a grenade actually
[4:02:45] <vernardohunk93> @AngriestPat you need 3 stuns and survive 1 min to win
[4:02:46] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> my first hardcore run i had to kill him using only matilda
[4:02:46] <D3rrtyD4n> oof
[4:02:46] <%Kaneis> @GradedBinkie Isn't his weak spot his exposed heart?

[4:03:00] <%HyperCharge_Sam> they make you use the plug so you have room for the rocket launcher
[4:03:02] <medril07> Is Leon pixelated?
[4:03:07] <D3rrtyD4n> if its yellow let it mellow
[4:03:08] <tri3dgE027> @ThorW much safer to just shoot him with 1 handgun bullet
[4:03:08] <$imextremelymanly> knife battle
[4:03:14] <%Kaneis> @medril07 He's polygonal
[4:03:15] <+GradedBinkie> @Kaneis yes but I've found he staggers easier with headshots
[4:03:15] <$Retrocop87> At this point, Mr. X comes off more as a Final Fantasy villain than an RE baddie
[4:03:17] <+secretspud> Tickle his sack!~

[4:08:37] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat once the rocks start falling your damage doesn't matter. Speedrunners just run around when that happens
[4:08:38] <animalxer> I could see paige beimg annette and pat being william birkin
[4:08:38] <fazoburquina> Kappa
[4:08:38] <NoirePanzer> PAT
[4:08:40] <alwayspronking> you had 40 rounds and 4 more grenades
[4:08:40] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 1
[4:08:40] <+MechaBaphomet> no
[4:08:41] <Ner234> ffs
[4:08:41] <$imextremelymanly> you could kill him with the miltilda

[4:08:45] <+thelastpaleemperor> @AngriestPat YOU ONLY USED THE MAGNUM WHY DO YOU HORDE SO MUCH
[4:08:45] <gamezerox> BUT YOU BEAT THAT BOSS
[4:08:46] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat You didn't even touch the shotgun that fight
[4:08:46] <gordieda20> Pat
[4:08:48] <+HexMasterMike> It's basically free shotgun ammo
[4:08:48] <%Rngiddion> X is time based damage makes no difference
[4:08:48] <Fujiwara_92> oh shut up, you
[4:08:49] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Spydurman) (warning)
[4:08:49] <ThorW> Actually Mr. X only takes a little damage, then it's tim ebased
[4:08:50] <+xx123manxx> the fight is time-based and speeds up slightly after damageing him I believe @AngriestPat
[4:08:51] <tank7013> Pat that boss is on a timer. Damaging him just reduces the timer
[4:08:52] <%anime_boyz> you could stand in his left arm and all of his attacks wouldve missed
[4:08:53] <FirearmsInstructor> I'm uninstalling superbunnyhop.
[4:08:53] <%Prism_Wing> Better try it again.
[4:08:54] <disister1201> PAT that boss is also on a timer
[4:08:56] <copyritetm> boss is time based, you dont need to spend a shot after birkin is dead
[4:08:56] <%ThirdWelles> You didn't even fucking touch it
[4:08:57] <%Corporate_Redeemer> TOFU TIME
[4:08:57] <+BorinCorran> Pat are you having a stroke? What are you on about?
[4:08:58] <forlorncarton> Final boss is a timer, damage only makes it take less time
[4:08:59] <%Nobrev> x is time based. you can beat him with no ammo theoretically
[4:09:00] <%madhattergay> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[4:09:01] <D3rrtyD4n> you dont need anything for boss, just the bullets on the table by typewriter
[4:09:01] <Gruhunchously> Shhhh, make him think he survived by the skin of his teeth.
[4:09:02] <%Typhaeon> Can't blame ya
[4:09:02] <krymzen5> you litteraly couldn't have!
[4:09:05] <majindusto> But Pat...THAT'S WRONG
[4:09:05] <%mayorrev> rip apex
[4:09:05] <%connos_livereview> you can kill him with handgun
[4:09:05] <+SolidusRex> The boss is timer based Pat.

[4:09:12] <%riantDeliration> ????
[4:09:13] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Then you still wouldn't have used it?
[4:09:13] <%SrG00SE> LMAO
[4:09:13] <FirearmsInstructor> It literally wouldn't have made a difference.
[4:09:14] <Marpolo13> but you didn't need it!
[4:09:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> What if he needed the shotgun later?
[4:09:15] <+thelastpaleemperor> Pat why do you horde so much for real @AngriestPat
[4:09:16] <vernardohunk93> but you didnt use it prior

[4:09:18] <+gael_jebidibah> wat
[4:09:19] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat It's a timed fight. Damage just speeds it up. Once hte rocks start falling, damage doesn't matter any more

[4:09:59] <medril07> Is blowing him up the only way to kill him?
[4:10:00] <%legendscar01> so what happened?
[4:10:01] <D3rrtyD4n> wait him out for 3 minutes
[4:10:01] <%mercado94> then punch him
[4:10:01] <Gruhunchously> Maybe the real Cliffy B was the Mr X we made along the way.

[4:12:58] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat we're just arguing that your margin of error was SO much larger than it needed to be.
[4:12:59] <+itschickenscratch> it doesnt let you have 0 ammo
[4:12:59] <+zanzibar_junker> handgun still works well though
[4:12:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The more ammo & resources you have, the harder the game adaptive difficulty is.
[4:13:00] <%connos_livereview> it doesnt work like that anymore old man

[4:18:49] <Djinnazz> its the same shit.
[4:18:50] <%LogothX> Next podcast sponsor: MONSTER
[4:18:51] <@Fuggins4U> I liked Monster
[4:18:51] <+Croetec> monster arnold palmer is god teir
[4:18:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> so is redbull
[4:18:53] <%GohanEgret> water is the GOAT

[4:18:57] <+TheEvaFreak> I feel that way about Red Bull actually
[4:18:57] <Midnight188> you drink Monster when you no longer care about anything and just want to be awake
[4:18:58] <Ataerus> Monster is zombie garbage
[4:18:58] <marvinthechair> try pacific punch monster
[4:18:58] <snootyhooty> there goes that monster sponsorship...
[4:19:00] <+Grayhammatter> it's basically the same goddamn thing

[4:19:16] <%Cthulos> I prefer it to red bull but it's poison, so I don't drink it

[4:25:59] <%Fluxraw> i actually never heard of lawbreakers until the twitter war today
[4:26:04] <FirearmsInstructor> More like "Cliffy F-" ?
[4:26:04] <D3rrtyD4n> @LogothX same
[4:26:06] <photonwarrior14> NNRU
[4:26:07] <$cureneckbeard> Pattle Royale
[4:26:11] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Radical Heights 2 > Apex Legends
[4:26:15] <Grennold> It was so average with some pretty shitty character designs. Funny thing is Apex is the same but because it's BR it's the new hotness 4Head
[4:26:15] <%ElenaManetta> you're rich in friendship, pat
[4:26:16] <D3rrtyD4n> yay
[4:26:22] <%gnarly_memes_bro> awwww
[4:26:24] <wydamn> Pat hasn't stolen enough severance pay to retire yet.
[4:26:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> @mickeycc1 Steve Buscelmo. but also yes.
[4:26:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> awww, Paaaat.
[4:26:29] <+timblenaut> dont lie we're awful
[4:26:32] <%afronooch> Your being paid to enjoy your hobby, why stop?
[4:26:34] <+SWFanatic> Kiryu-Chan
[4:26:34] <+Shockrates20XX> Wait did I miss any CliffyB talk?
[4:26:35] <%awsomesaucekirby> They're still FIRST LEVEL
[4:26:36] <%Skeletorexplains> would you donate to us as a change of pace?
[4:26:39] <%InsaneJackLondon> dawwww
[4:26:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Goblins
[4:26:42] <+8framelag> if i wont the lottery fuck you guys Kappa
[4:26:43] <disister1201> I wonder how Clifford feels about Apex coming out with no hype and just fucking killing it
[4:26:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you precious shit talker, you.
[4:26:43] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pat needs to Photoshop more wedding photos
[4:26:44] <mickeycc1> ohoh
[4:26:47] <%connos_livereview> If i won the lottery id spend it all on spite
[4:26:51] <%GohanEgret> @Shockrates20XX yeah, especially at the startt of the stream
[4:26:52] <%Typhaeon> Peanut Brain: Patch mediocre games like Siege & For Honor until they're great
[4:26:53] <NarcissistCactus> you suck
[4:26:55] <Magnetgear> @awsomesaucekirby RIP
[4:26:58] <%ThirdWelles> are we gonna get some rational pat?
[4:26:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> your bad
[4:27:02] <%ThirdWelles> Is this really gonna happen?
[4:27:04] <+8framelag> stingy play is after you master re4, pistol (red9) only
[4:27:09] <%Typhaeon> Galaxy Brain: Steal your employees' time & liquidate their studio to retire
[4:27:10] <+Ell1ot> Pat would fire us if he won the lottery? Would we get severance?
[4:27:11] <%mister___doctor> If ammo was made out of cows would we call it Ammoo
[4:27:12] <%connos_livereview> yeah but this game will buff you
[4:27:14] <photonwarrior14> Cliffy B is a cuck. NNRU my photon warriors.
[4:27:18] <bloodypurpledog> if woolie does a titanfall night you should do a radical heights night
[4:27:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat YOU MISS lol
[4:27:35] <$imextremelymanly> oh really?
[4:27:46] <%SrG00SE> ya and you wouldnt miss
[4:27:52] <jossahmol> good night chat
[4:27:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> So the random element makes you go way hard in the other direction?
[4:28:01] <+8framelag> imagine re2 (og) with rng and adaptive difficulty
[4:28:05] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat So you're saying more variables = big scary, yes?
[4:28:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its scary
[4:28:08] <+Grayhammatter> that's dumb
[4:28:10] <lloyddboy> and you can MISS
[4:28:11] <%Jesus_X_Boredom> Gotta learn how to game the RNG
[4:28:13] <Djinnazz> HP is the same.
[4:28:15] <%SrG00SE> or what if you miss a lot and decide to load the last save anyway?
[4:28:17] <DotDusk> Hoard those bullets
[4:28:18] <%Rngiddion> but saving it means it will have more health
[4:28:18] <+SWFanatic> @AngriestPat Any desire to go back and play the original RE2 after remake?
[4:28:20] <xeros720> pat is literally creating impossible scenarios
[4:28:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The more you save, the more the game thinks you have, the more the adaptive difficulty goes UP.
[4:28:25] <+WilderWolfMan> you run away LIKE A COWARD
[4:28:25] <Zeddsworth> I thought bosses HP was fixed?
[4:28:26] <Fujiwara_92> rng is the Pat killer
[4:28:29] <+Grayhammatter> knowing you, you will ALWAYS have enough
[4:28:32] <+ChaosVulpes> Pat the bullet farmer
[4:28:33] <+miguelrod777> but you're planning is making it. more difficult
[4:28:34] <%connos_livereview> it BUFFS YOU IFF YOU HAVE LESS AMMO you said this yourself
[4:28:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AngriestPat Pat, why not just get a MOD that TELLS you what the variables are?
[4:28:40] <%sourceofall> only
[4:28:43] <breadwoof> the woolie method
[4:28:46] <%SrG00SE> then you would have loaded a save at that point
[4:28:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat and the flamethrower
[4:28:50] <vernardohunk93> you literally can beat the game with only the pistol or shotgun
[4:28:50] <lloyddboy> ONLY
[4:28:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat and 8 grenades
[4:28:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm sure it exists.
[4:28:58] <%Corporate_Redeemer> But Pat, Woolie's LP of RE2 debunks your theory
[4:29:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Then you would have reloaded
[4:29:06] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat You can narrow the margin of error a LITTLE bit though. We're just saying it's too big
[4:29:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> like you did anyway
[4:29:10] <%connos_livereview> this is apatBig goblins
[4:29:13] <%skizzuto> pat you were never in danger of running out for most of this playthrough
[4:29:14] <+Ell1ot> what if you shot your foot with every shot?
[4:29:19] <%ThePaleSage> Did I miss apex?
[4:29:19] <Fujiwara_92> IF ONLY THIS GAME HAD ADPTATIVE DIFFICULTY HUH DansGame l
[4:29:20] <disister1201> You can save the most ammo by not playing Kappa
[4:29:23] <Djinnazz> Its the same thing on HC.
[4:29:24] <+LowBatteryLife> What if you just told you a mod that named all the boss phases and told your DPS in each one?
[4:29:28] <+8framelag> run out of bullets, final bullet does all boss' life
[4:29:31] <%SrG00SE> @disister1201 200iq
[4:29:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat LESS item SLOTS
[4:29:47] <%lewd_sister_of_battle> Pretty sure hes doin them old timey trolls
[4:29:53] <%Konquerer> apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy
[4:29:56] <photonwarrior14> N*gger Nerds Rise Up!
[4:29:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Tell Paige to stream
[4:29:59] <+kauze12> What if the game crashes and corrupts your save?
[4:30:02] <%SrG00SE> we did, great streams this week
[4:30:03] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Cue Woolie bumbling through a Hardcore LP firing EVERY. SINGLE. SHOT.
