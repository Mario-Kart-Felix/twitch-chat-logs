[0:16:05] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt wow you look energetic
[0:16:05] <%Tornix> yeah do those off stream
[0:16:07] <kakachimaro> patrick
[0:16:09] <%coreyyotto> they are for the offscreen grinding
[0:16:15] <%PanicSwytch> We want the RAW dungeons
[0:16:16] <%ShogunNoonto> they take like 10-15 mins
[0:16:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Battle arena is way better

[0:16:38] <%Garthunox> I barely got 2 levels out of it when i unlocked it
[0:16:40] <TReaperx1> :)
[0:16:41] <majindusto> Pat's Cowardice Strikes Again!!!
[0:16:43] <%sumrand0> Appreciate it: extra grinding isn't necessary, focus on content and avoid the accidental no sleep due to streaming
[0:16:44] <+zanzibar_junker> you get better upgrade materials
[0:16:47] <%off_to_work_we_go> psaDogchamp psaBlep
[0:16:48] <kozboz96> the second underground is worth it
[0:16:48] <%Movemeister> yakuza is the battle construction vehicles we deserve
[0:16:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The underground is worth it for xp that's it.
[0:16:52] <+Link232> A lot of 'metal slime' enemies in the underground but the arena is better for exp grinding in my opinion
[0:16:53] <Spagheddies> Oh god yeah.
[0:16:53] <%Garthunox> YEAH IT DOES
[0:16:53] <%eyezehuhh> psaUp
[0:16:54] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:16:56] <Zarkith> The underground is worth doing at least once because of the Sujimon in it
[0:16:56] <kozboz96> the yokohhamaone isnt it
[0:16:58] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS Nocturne
[0:17:01] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yeah its really intense
[0:17:02] <gamingspacesloth> There’s the new reaction image
[0:17:03] <%Garthunox> But the underground aint where to grind
[0:17:04] <Spagheddies> You'll see, but yeah.
[0:17:04] <TReaperx1> battle arena is good for armors and weapons
[0:17:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Chapter 11 is an insane jump.
[0:17:06] <chimeraxmachina> Raw ass dungeons? We have a few of those around town
[0:17:09] <Spagheddies> It's whacky.
[0:17:09] <redrins> oh yeah theres a jump from freaking 40 to 50, but the arena helps get you up there
[0:17:11] <%coreyyotto> you're gonna be fine for this session since you got Eri early, but in chapter 12 shit gets real
[0:17:15] <primarch_lupercal> at your pace i think ur fine
[0:17:21] <%sumrand0> Sujimon Sujimon monsters Sujimon are the champions!!!!
[0:17:22] <+zanzibar_junker> you have the battle arena for that
[0:17:23] <%Tornix> at least slime grinding is pretty easy late game
[0:17:33] <+TheotherKristian> Either the game blows up or pat blows up
[0:17:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The level jump is so crazy the game pops up with a message warning you about it.
[0:17:37] <+Wilabeen1997> When you unlock the battle arena, there is a massive grind wall before you can progress story

[0:18:08] <%Garthunox> OH YEAH THAT HAPPENS
[0:18:14] <%SunnyVarietyPack> i left the dungeon to grind
[0:18:18] <%Yautjabutts> There's only one place that super requires grinding and thats super super endgame
[0:18:19] <+zanzibar_junker> they will tell you to grind
[0:18:19] <%Garthunox> BUT TAXIS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE!
[0:18:20] <+CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan p5 last dungeon

[0:18:32] <%otakusquarefan> game warns you
[0:18:33] <+xeros720> fighting higher level enemies isn't that hard either
[0:18:35] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Honestly love that these games have "Point of No Return" warnings
[0:18:36] <+Wilabeen1997> It’s nothing too bad on that front
[0:18:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Binkie Dick Pat Digivolve tooooooo Peppy Prick Pat
[0:18:37] <Saltmeisterr> oh man
[0:18:38] <SonicD4> @patstaresat should I have another coffee? just finished one
[0:18:38] <%BoxNavy> THE BION
[0:18:46] <Saltmeisterr> i forgot about BIODAD
[0:18:54] <+Kaiser_Loar> Sorta When you die it ask if you want to restart before starting the mission
[0:18:59] <TReaperx1> you are da best content
[0:19:01] <Rabbidbunnyz> the bion is a very strong name
[0:19:09] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:19:10] <kakachimaro> are you ok patrick
[0:19:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game gives 1 warning that you're gonna see tougher enemies and 1 warning when it's time to do all the substories because you won't be able to soon.
[0:19:18] <antshadow14> snk
[0:19:18] <%YakumoYomi> Lucky 21!
[0:19:21] <%BoxNavy> ehhhh i dunno
[0:19:22] <Rabbidbunnyz> agreed

[0:19:25] <+CookieCutter007> PogChamp
[0:19:27] <Rabbidbunnyz> and i have a needle phobia
[0:19:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> needle
[0:19:28] <%AzureGale> I REALLY hope Crazy Talk will not activate here
[0:19:31] <%Garthunox> Hopefully
[0:19:32] <%arancet> that hobo is lying
[0:19:32] <%BoxNavy> and he will lie to you
[0:19:32] <StencilOST> gotta get it twice
[0:19:32] <skeletonknifefight> thats what he'll tell you at least
[0:19:33] <librettodude> He'll only TELL you it is, though
[0:19:34] <%Jamejarrs> The communal Covid Needle
[0:19:36] <%cvp5127> Oops its a covid enhancer
[0:19:36] <%linSP> you thought 2020 was bad
[0:19:36] <+zanzibar_junker> invest in the meals SURVIVE BAR makes. They are the best
[0:19:37] <theanora1> and then you can kiss strangers again
[0:19:39] <TReaperx1> 50/50 covid or lethal shot

[0:19:43] <%ShogunNoonto> but what if its not
[0:19:44] <devanmuse> Just because he says it's the Covid vaccine doesn't mean it's the Covid vaccine
[0:19:44] <%LuckyLagomorph> People have been saying that for YEARS and it always gets worse
[0:19:44] <%Garthunox> 21! SUCK MY DICK!
[0:19:45] <%medusasghost> yeah gimme that chip
[0:19:48] <%BoxNavy> it was actually a black tar heroin
[0:19:48] <%McSoliace> CRAZY TALK
[0:19:48] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Heya Pat The new Yakuza has to be one of the best RPG I've played in a while. Wild that the turn-based mechanics were not originally planned.
[0:19:48] <%walternatorz> but pat, that's how they inject the micro chip
[0:19:50] <%AzureGale> GOTEM
[0:19:52] <Rabbidbunnyz> you thought it was vaccine but it was hobo jizz again!
[0:19:53] <%sumrand0> 2021 YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER?!?! Hahahaha just wait this Covid vaccine will end up making 28 Days Later zombies a.k.a FAST ZOMBIES
[0:19:54] <lisadagz> Sounds like a blast
[0:19:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THEN RACOON CITY WILL HAPPEN
[0:19:55] <+Dunmarkh> that hobo won't give you a microchip
[0:19:57] <%ConLin_Arts_> WutFace

[0:20:01] <%condemned_15> Piss Needles
[0:20:01] <+xeros720> "you all have to share the same vaccine"
[0:20:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Let everyone remember PAt RUINED 2021
[0:20:03] <%Garthunox> It was actually nothing
[0:20:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> hopefully
[0:20:03] <%UvBenServed> Hobo pee IS the COVID vaccine
[0:20:06] <%walternatorz> hobo pee is the cure to covid
[0:20:06] <antshadow14> merryw3Noises
[0:20:07] <+Take_2_shots> Would you trust a Vaccine from Namba.
[0:20:09] <%PigGuy800> I feel like that should be followed by a wink wink nudge nudge
[0:20:09] <lastrin> BuT ThE ChIp PaTs!
[0:20:10] <Pookiedaexzile> mark the date
[0:20:13] <%condemned_15> 0

[0:20:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 0 or 7
[0:20:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Don'tfuck with Crazy Talk
[0:20:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 0
[0:20:15] <%Garthunox> 0
[0:20:15] <+InstantGameOvers> Hobo pee was the cure all along!
[0:20:19] <%BoxNavy> this one
[0:20:19] <+zanzibar_junker> 0
[0:20:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Those are your choices.
[0:20:20] <%McSoliace> yeah
[0:20:21] <%Garthunox> Just play 0 - 7
[0:20:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 0 or 7
[0:20:23] <%Lion_kun> Judgment too
[0:20:29] <%HefestoForges> 0, 0 or 7
[0:20:31] <%Lion_kun> 0, 7 or Judgment
[0:20:31] <%McSoliace> 0 first for context
[0:20:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could play 0 first then 7 after.
[0:20:38] <%McSoliace> fuck those people
[0:20:38] <TReaperx1> im surprised we didnt get racoon city IRL on 2020
[0:20:38] <%eyezehuhh> 0 7
[0:20:39] <Rabbidbunnyz> that's dumb 0 rules
[0:20:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Those people are dumb.
[0:20:42] <%Mildly_Eccentric> 0
[0:20:46] <majindusto> START AT 0
[0:20:47] <+CookieCutter007> Kiwami 1's bosses are wack
[0:20:47] <Spagheddies> Nah, 0 is the best to start.
[0:20:47] <%Garthunox> fuck those idiots
[0:20:48] <%coreyyotto> Clemps out there doing it right
[0:20:49] <%BoxNavy> but... 0 is before 1...
[0:20:50] <SonicD4> zero is just better than 1
[0:20:50] <+xeros720> those have issues
[0:20:52] <%medusasghost> yakuza 0 was a great starting game for me
[0:20:53] <%Tornix> I agree
[0:20:54] <bob900000> kawami refrances 0
[0:20:56] <%sumrand0> People will get upset no matter what choice you make IT'S WHY PEOPLE KINDA SUCK
[0:20:57] <%condemned_15> original 1 and 2 are a little jank
[0:21:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 0 was designed to get people into the series.
[0:21:01] <TReaperx1> yakuza 0 is a good start
[0:21:01] <+Schir> just start with 5, don't be a coward
[0:21:02] <Hoot_Patoots> play Kiwami 1 if you're already sure you're gonna enjoy the franchise
[0:21:03] <%off_to_work_we_go> Start with Dead Souls obviously
[0:21:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So was 7
[0:21:06] <%coreyyotto> Kiwami 1 specifically is a terrible place to start
[0:21:09] <%OfficerMods> After finishing this game I researched Japanese politics and this game is gives the least fucks. Its wild how political it is
[0:21:11] <comedeity> 0 is so good
[0:21:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah you need to see Kiryu be Kiryu but worse
[0:21:15] <%BoxNavy> play 6 and only 6
[0:21:24] <%Yamchadassist> kiwami one felt shitty to play vs zero and kiwami 2 is great soo yes=a fuck 1
[0:21:24] <astrophizz> kiwami is like an expansion to 0
[0:21:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kiryu's origin matters less than Majima's origin.
[0:21:28] <Spagheddies> The people that said 1 is the best starter have a bad case of the beef brain.
[0:21:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And 0 is Majima's origin.
[0:21:32] <+Schir> @BoxNavy correct
[0:21:33] <Rabbidbunnyz> wesker shoot
[0:21:39] <%OfficerMods> BLACKU MONDAY
[0:21:39] <%Garthunox> ITS THE MARK 2 PAT!
[0:21:43] <+Snektor> Huh I almost had the same question, stream got me interested in the series. Thanks for the recommendation @PatStaresAt
[0:21:44] <%SunnyVarietyPack> honestly yakuza 3 is still the worse
[0:21:48] <theanora1> I started with Kiwami 1 and want to play more
[0:21:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Kiryu doesn't need an orgin, He's honor Yakuza
[0:21:52] <TReaperx1> its mostly play by order to know who lives or dies
[0:21:57] <%QuipSan> ye
[0:22:01] <%Garthunox> Nahhhh
[0:22:05] <+Snektor> wit what?
[0:22:05] <Hoot_Patoots> aww i like 6
[0:22:05] <majindusto> NO
[0:22:05] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I enjoyed yaluza 6
[0:22:06] <%coreyyotto> but the baby
[0:22:09] <%McSoliace> the end and beginning aren't
[0:22:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There are parts of 7 that feel like the writers wanted to put this shit in 6 but someone said no.
[0:22:12] <+Taglog7> but da baby
[0:22:13] <%Jaller101514> no
[0:22:14] <+SilverDevilfish> 3 and 6 are pretty skippable
[0:22:17] <+zanzibar_junker> Korean vergil was the best part
[0:22:17] <%OfficerMods> no pat yakuza 6 is plot important to 7
[0:22:18] <%the22cstomp> 6 ia great tho
[0:22:18] <majindusto> I LOVED 6
[0:22:20] <convo445> y6 was aight
[0:22:21] <NitronStreams> The Mark 2 will never be forgotten
[0:22:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Alternatively feels like they're apologizing for 6.
[0:22:22] <+Taglog7> LUL
[0:22:24] <+CookieCutter007> but Korean Vergil though
[0:22:25] <%Jaller101514> its kiryus ending
[0:22:25] <%eyezehuhh> yeah, they get pretty dumb in that one
[0:22:28] <majindusto> BOO PAT
[0:22:29] <devanmuse> Yakuza 6 got you to cry over DAIGO DOJIMA
[0:22:30] <%Garthunox> You're just mad you got tricked into caring about Daigo!
[0:22:31] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt yakuza 6 is the best from minigames
[0:22:31] <+Take_2_shots> What happened in 6 anyway?
[0:22:34] <EBT93> I loved 6, tho.
[0:22:35] <%Dova573> but ONO MICHIO PAT
[0:22:35] <%sumrand0> @officermods yeah.....Japan's kinda fucked up. As an American I feel justified in declaring that especially since we're partially responsible since we forced our legal system on them and we're already not great at using it. Japan however....they've fucked it up in a totally different way
[0:22:37] <Spagheddies> The last 30% is rough, but I don't know that I'd say it's skippable.
[0:22:38] <%coreyyotto> it hit some big sentimental notes, kinda similar to MGS4
[0:22:39] <bob900000> 5 ends on a cliffhanger
[0:22:40] <tsnakesrule> 6 isnt skippable at all what
[0:22:40] <Rabbidbunnyz> rubber bullet
[0:22:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> YUP
[0:22:41] <+darthvader438> PAT STOP FAPPING
[0:22:41] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> At least Onomichi is nice to walk around in at night
[0:22:46] <+chronopaladin> well he got better
[0:22:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> HE WAS TOO KILL WE SHOULDN'T HAVE KILLED HIM.
[0:22:49] <%condemned_15> Sohei Dojima is an asshole
[0:22:49] <%TenderBabyBacon> they do go over that.
[0:22:50] <+Yuletideriz> Takeshi Kitano was the shit
[0:22:50] <Rabbidbunnyz> rubber blood
[0:22:51] <+Snektor> no thats fair
[0:22:52] <+Schir> oh yeah 6 is super bland, but it's funny to only play the last game that requires the most context
[0:22:52] <%linSP> wasn’t 6 something about boats
[0:22:52] <convo445> you sure gonna know in the next 2 hours
[0:22:53] <%eyezehuhh> Kiryu straight smooth brained at the end
[0:22:54] <%BoxNavy> is it 100% the same dude though
[0:22:55] <Hoot_Patoots> rubber FACE
[0:22:57] <%BoxNavy> i didnt play 6
[0:22:59] <%AzureGale> They used a Legendary First Aid kit
[0:22:59] <+loukemia83> @patstaresat do you know about the tagout system in battle? you can pull your bench guys in and out in the Etc. menu
[0:23:00] <majindusto> BAD TASTE PAT AS USUAL
[0:23:01] <%coreyyotto> rubber blood
[0:23:03] <+CookieCutter007> the explanation is so stupid LUL
[0:23:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE GOT BETTER
[0:23:04] <%Jamejarrs> But Ono Michio!
[0:23:05] <Rabbidbunnyz> it was rubberman
[0:23:05] <%cvp5127> too hot to die
[0:23:07] <%OfficerMods> rubber blood
[0:23:08] <+zanzibar_junker> they brought back other characters too
[0:23:09] <majindusto> No
[0:23:09] <%Cn_alpha_02> No they didnt.
[0:23:11] <%McSoliace> don't worry about it
[0:23:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He is a famous Korean actor and K-Pop star.
[0:23:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Big money
[0:23:14] <%Grimlockfly> ESSENCE OF FACE SHOOT Party500
[0:23:16] <%Garthunox> @BoxNavy yes
[0:23:16] <%walternatorz> they don't make bullets like they used to
[0:23:17] <%condemned_15> He too pretty the bullet can't hurt him
[0:23:18] <%coreyyotto> too hot to die
[0:23:21] <%Ynkubus_> Merely pretending
[0:23:22] <%Garthunox> Ame!
[0:23:25] <theanora1> they killed a famous korean actor for Yakuza 6? Hardcore
[0:23:26] <EBT93> 6 was pretty good, Pat.
[0:23:28] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt he was a body double he even said it in 6 when you fought him as a boss
[0:23:30] <%fakeburg> Yes
[0:23:32] <%QuipSan> Yes
[0:23:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[0:23:33] <%fakeburg> there still it

[0:29:34] <%condemned_15> jizz joke?

[0:29:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Cyberpunk 2 will come out before Kotor 2 is played on this channel
[0:29:39] <%BoxNavy> is it like a sex?
[0:29:39] <theanora1> Can you imagine a Woolie FF14 play through?
[0:29:41] <majindusto> Still cant believe how Buthurt Woolie got over the "Next Bit" gag
[0:29:42] <%the22cstomp> i think that was a cum joke
[0:29:47] <%Daxalog> What?
[0:29:47] <%McSoliace> yu[
[0:29:50] <%McSoliace> yup*
[0:29:52] <%Tornix> It's my jrpg of the year
[0:29:52] <Hoot_Patoots> "we made one of the best RPGs in years, as a joke"
[0:29:52] <%wruce__billis> why KOTOR2 and not a good game adventure like Torment or Planescape or Disco Elysium or Fallout 1 or 2
[0:29:53] <%Daxalog> I didnt type that
[0:29:53] <sampsonhero> hello pat <3
[0:29:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Maybe one day Pat will finish FFVII
[0:29:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yakuza 7 made this amazing JRPG combat in SIX MONTHS
[0:29:54] <%krispen_wa> For an April Fools prank
[0:29:57] <%Tornix> and I've played a lot this year
[0:29:57] <Zarkith> FIVE MONTHS!?!?!?
[0:29:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> He subbed inside, resulting in a sub baby
[0:29:59] <%Daxalog> Fuck
[0:30:00] <Pookiedaexzile> God Shit
[0:30:01] <%McSoliace> actually impressive
[0:30:05] <%honeyman18> Stream pregnant joke?
[0:30:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 5 MONTHS?!
[0:30:07] <%coreyyotto> they had to have been sitting on the prototype for years
[0:30:09] <kitestar> it's almost like paper mario ttyd
[0:30:13] <%OfficerMods> we made an rpg as a joke
[0:30:13] <EBT93> It started out as an April Fool’s joke.
[0:30:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I have to assume someone was working on this on their own in the back.
[0:30:15] <+loukemia83> they probably just asked the persona people to do it
[0:30:17] <%Yamchadassist> talent goes a looong way
[0:30:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or at least writing up concepts.
[0:30:19] <%cvp5127> it was a joke too
[0:30:24] <%BaybeeBat> theyve smashed it
[0:30:24] <%BoxNavy> i mean. its basic rpg stuff that they improved upon. i can believe it
[0:30:27] <%Lion_kun> take that Square Enix
[0:30:29] <%owazowski> That's fucking insane
[0:30:34] <astrophizz> yakuza was basically already a jrpg in everything but combat
[0:30:39] <majindusto> IT WAS AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE
[0:30:43] <%krispen_wa> Are they like in constant mega crunch?
[0:30:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It re-uses them well though.
[0:30:48] <kitestar> I'm hoping 3-5 comes to steam
[0:30:50] <%AzureGale> Yakuza is the Atelier of Yakuza games
[0:30:51] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt they finally made a JRPG where the heroes are actual ADULTS
[0:30:57] <%sumrand0> and Anthem was in development for like 5 years hahahahaha not all time is equal, intelligence/vision is more important
[0:31:01] <%LuckyLagomorph> LuckyLagomorph subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Hey Pat how's it going? I love Yakuza Like a Dragon but I'll have to admit the grind for the true final dungeon is slowly killing me
[0:31:03] <%QuipSan> I love it

[0:31:06] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Kamurocho is always great to visit
[0:31:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> THEY'RE SHITTY OLD MEN
[0:31:11] <convo445> nothings changed except combat

[0:33:53] <%Garthunox> But Hitomi and Anri tho
[0:33:54] <+Take_2_shots> Do they import their MILF's?
[0:33:59] <%Mildly_Eccentric> milf coded is just as good
[0:34:01] <%Frost_Quill> B-but the doujins...
[0:34:01] <%Jaxnos> nah, those chat folk are just using the pron definition of MILF which means "women older than 23"
[0:34:02] <%krispen_wa> Japan is going to go extinct via culture
[0:34:02] <%Ipsenscastle> It also has an ILF shortage though
[0:34:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Social Awkward Mature Singles in your Area

[0:34:10] <%BoxNavy> alright
[0:34:15] <ZComiX> What about GILFs rio
[0:34:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why Ichiban in Yakuza 8 is on a quest to impregnate all the side-characters.
[0:34:15] <%eyezehuhh> Anri will make up for the deficit
[0:34:16] <%Garthunox> Whats NTR?

[0:34:23] <%Aarseth> Aarseth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[0:34:29] <%OfficerMods> import the Indonesian tree rats
[0:34:33] <%Tornix> they do it every console release
[0:34:40] <+TheotherKristian> I had one ebgames/gamestop tell me they had over 300 backorders for ps5
[0:34:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> PS5 Fallout76 Edition
[0:34:45] <+xeros720> they always pull that shit
[0:34:45] <TReaperx1> just wait for 2021 and forget about it
[0:34:48] <+TheotherKristian> one ebgames
[0:34:50] <theanora1> bundle a PS5 with used PS4s
[0:34:50] <%sumrand0> PS5 w/ Covid virus= instantly still sold out
[0:34:53] <+Seitine> It's also cause half of the idiots that scream MILF online now just act like anyone that's older and has bit tits is one. LUL
[0:34:57] <@SSaryn> You could probably smear shit on the PS5 box and people still would buy it
[0:34:57] <+SammyOVision> Also the console JUST came out you're gonna be getting a game for it with it
[0:35:06] <+CookieCutter007> what about a ps5 made out of funko pops

[0:35:13] <+corrosivePaladin> but piss5
[0:35:13] <+zanzibar_junker> totally
[0:35:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> At work we aren't letting people buy PS5s in store.
[0:35:16] <%BoxNavy> its not worth it
[0:35:17] <%promessav2> i wouldn't be suprised if somehow ps5's are getting used for mining
[0:35:19] <bob900000> not worth it
[0:35:21] <viciousgrim> or you can buy it from a scalper for $1000
[0:35:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Order pick-up or drive up only.
[0:35:23] <Pookiedaexzile> But ME THO

[0:38:28] <%Jaller101514> aww
[0:38:28] <%Yautjabutts> imagine cheating in a yakuza game
[0:38:30] <TReaperx1> the super final dungeon will need 30 hours of grind
[0:38:32] <%LuckyLagomorph> NEVER
[0:38:37] <%bread_assassin> Enforcer = knight
[0:38:37] <Foymic> question denied
[0:38:40] <%wruce__billis> Homeless is sage, which isn't classic, it;'s a DQ only class
[0:38:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're not supposed to grind for True Final Millenium Tower. You're supposed to do it after NG+ on Legend difficulty.
[0:38:52] <Spagheddies> Homeless = White Mage.
[0:38:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's your grind.
[0:38:57] <%PanicSwytch> Words are hard

[0:39:19] <%wruce__billis> I grinded for Amon in 0
[0:39:20] <%Yautjabutts> the true final millenium tower doesn't need that much grind. it just needs two job levels maxed out at least
[0:39:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Redoing the entire the game is your grind.
[0:39:31] <%coreyyotto> that's how it was originally implemented in the japanese release
[0:39:32] <tsnakesrule> Was lvl 85 and I CANT HIT ANYTHING
[0:39:37] <%Garthunox> Amon is easy in every game though
[0:39:38] <tsnakesrule> its all m i s s
[0:39:41] <Ultimatefool> AMONgus

[0:52:39] <%AzureGale> If your thumbtacks are glowing consult a doctor
[0:52:43] <%DakotaMacDoodle> That thumb tack move is the shit
[0:52:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're all good.
[0:52:49] <Hoot_Patoots> dealer's super cool
[0:52:56] <tsnakesrule> Base jobs are mostly op ngl
[0:52:56] <@SSaryn> Matriarch on Eri is easily one of the best due to Noblesse Oblige.
[0:52:57] <uncle_speeps> Hitman is actually busted
[0:53:00] <Hoot_Patoots> oh cool this one
[0:53:01] <digitalbooklet> yeah i am curious about best jobs too, I'm near endgame and still kinda conflicted
[0:53:02] <+HefestoForges> PAIGE?
[0:53:03] <SomeOtherNeb> SUPLEX HER
[0:53:04] <tsnakesrule> Enforcer is op
[0:53:05] <@SSaryn> But yeah most jobs are really really good.
[0:53:05] <iosephe> Spice time!
[0:53:08] <Zarkith> Awww yeah, fukken LOVE this substory
[0:53:09] <%AzureGale> LET THE SPICE FLOW
[0:53:10] <%Esparsenior> I love the battle music so much in this game
[0:53:10] <%walternatorz> is she a time traveler?
[0:53:10] <%the22cstomp> the best part about yakuza 7 is that there's no claims ichiban never killed anyone so ichiban is free to murder people
[0:53:11] <+Iggysteve> i love this one
[0:53:11] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[0:53:12] <%BoxNavy> KIL HER
[0:53:13] <%Grimlockfly> YEAAAAAH THIS ONE RULLLLES
[0:53:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I dunno, I prefer having Saeko as Matriarch and Eri as Dealer.
[0:53:18] <%Omegaanimus> Eri with dealer and matriarch skills is busted
[0:53:22] <KingVantq> @SSaryn is it better than Clerk on her?
[0:53:23] <%toastybites> why does she look like she is going to tackle someone
[0:53:26] <digitalbooklet> GRANDMA LETS GOOO
[0:53:30] <%Jhylla81> Canadian Destroyer her
[0:53:31] <TReaperx1> just give her a good kick
[0:53:35] <Hoot_Patoots> Matriarch is so fucking badass
[0:53:36] <BlackOrchidKI> Perfect SUPLEX positioning SwiftRage
[0:53:38] <tsnakesrule> Give Nanba fortuneteller so he gets the lightning attack
[0:53:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Grandma stay home!
[0:53:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:46] <%rdark_ksu> is she part monkey with that posture?
[0:53:47] <+Ixek> Respect.
[0:53:48] <%BoxNavy> o-okay...
[0:53:51] <+Canarchy10> I managed through all game with hero Chef idol and hit man pretty easily
[0:53:56] <%Omegaanimus> she's literally begging to be jackknife powerbombed
[0:53:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Good Work Granny

[0:54:12] <brachydios777> @terrorkinga Found it, I think it’s where he meets Sosa
[0:54:12] <SomeOtherNeb> GOTTA GO FAST
[0:54:17] <TReaperx1> just tell her a milf hunter in the other side
[0:54:18] <+BeneathItAll> :(
[0:54:19] <%AzureGale> FAILURE
[0:54:19] <%Movemeister> she needs MORE POWER
[0:54:20] <BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:54:20] <%galehound> damn it she almost made it
[0:54:20] <+crazyspartan214> poor paige
[0:54:24] <Hoot_Patoots> i've seen old people in Japan with that actual posture so yeah, it's super real
[0:54:24] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> heyo, what did I miss?
[0:54:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This sidequest is some silly shit Pat.
[0:54:25] <%Leftovermemes> Poor Paige
[0:54:26] <%walternatorz> THE GREATEST OPPONENT
[0:54:27] <@SSaryn> @KingVantq Once you get your Naginata upgraded, yeah it's easily one of the best for her. Her Noblisse Oblige can do like, 600-1200 damage even resisted.
[0:54:33] <%toastybites> why didnt she wait closer to the curb
[0:54:33] <bramblebird> GO PAIGE
[0:54:35] <%eyezehuhh> Yikes Paige
[0:54:35] <%Esparsenior> Poor Paige
[0:54:36] <+MoonObscure> lol
[0:54:37] <%Omegaanimus> grab her by the scruff of the neck and her pants and toss her
[0:54:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Dropkick her spine straight.
[0:54:38] <DashXero> This old lady's never getting home.
[0:54:39] <%Jhylla81> Kabuto-style Rider Kick her across the street
[0:54:39] <%TerrorkingA> Getting hit by a car is only 100 damage. that old lady has been around for so long she probably has WAY more HP than Ichiban gained in, like, the 3 months he's been out of prison
[0:54:39] <%condemned_15> BREAK HER BACK MAKE HER HUMBLE
[0:54:43] <%TerrorkingA> She's running a scam.
[0:54:43] <%Broken_Sonex> ITS PAIGE
[0:54:44] <+MoonObscure> XDDD

[0:55:18] <PartyFavors> It's not a victory if she never crosses that street anywhere else
[0:55:21] <+Dunmarkh> the battle is lost but the war continues
[0:55:23] <%HefestoForges> make the crosswalk shorter, Ichiban!
[0:55:23] <%UvBenServed> The crosswalk won the battle, not the war
[0:55:23] <MarvelousMrD> just bend her spine back the right way
[0:55:24] <%SpcOpsBear> @digitalbooklet
[0:55:27] <Pookiedaexzile> 5 minutes

[1:00:35] <%blaccbird914> eri is so busted its nuts
[1:00:36] <Hoot_Patoots> best early game AOE
[1:00:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> nOW ITS TIME TO GO BEAT UP THE CHILD!
[1:00:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Noblesse Oblige misses too often.
[1:00:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It does good damage though.
[1:00:53] <%AzureGale> I wish they showed who would potentially get affected by AoE attacks
[1:00:54] <iosephe> Dancer AOE was better imo
[1:00:55] <%Jaxnos> what is happening in that restaurant wait
[1:01:03] <Hoot_Patoots> i have a fondness for Graceful Horizon
[1:01:04] <@SSaryn> @Too_Much_Nukie Idk about you, but it never missed for me. Hit at least 600-1200 even resisted.
[1:01:06] <watts121> Windmill is my favorite move in the game.
[1:01:07] <%Jaxnos> there were people just walking on the tables
[1:01:08] <Blank9> fortuneteller's lightning is the best AoE to me
[1:01:10] <%condemned_15> BORG
[1:01:13] <AthenaAegis> Burger REX
[1:01:14] <watts121> Well that and anything Devil Rocker does.
[1:01:15] <+MoonObscure> HAHA
[1:01:16] <+AlphaRayAllen> haHAA
[1:01:17] <tsnakesrule> I gave Eri Dealer soulsy because that class is crit heavy, changed her back for one dealer move and made hear a Crit Demon
[1:01:17] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt We all know that people are all inherently good, Pat. You just have to point out to them that their actions impact more than themselves and then they'll do the right thing! Duh.
[1:01:21] <Goodvibes99508> so how long untill we find out his mom works at a soapland?
[1:01:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Breaker AOE is the bst early game AOE.
[1:01:24] <+Pyroclase> ME TOO
[1:01:25] <Ravingpyro> my brother has adopted two little kittens. the runt is so small it makes me sad
[1:01:27] <+dramajoe> haHAA
[1:01:29] <%Broken_Sonex> OLLLLD MAAAAAAN
[1:01:31] <%caramelatte1> yup
[1:01:32] <%promessav2> almost 10, almost in the grave
[1:01:32] <SomeOtherNeb> I'm 9.97!
[1:01:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @SSaryn I don't mean miss like misses the target it aims at. The AoE often doesn't hit everyone in its space because of the gaps.
[1:01:36] <+Snektor> YUP
[1:01:38] <+Ixek> jermaPluto
[1:01:38] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[1:01:39] <%Jaxnos> like what you still do with your height, Pat?
[1:01:42] <%kewlmyc> yep
[1:01:43] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:01:44] <@SSaryn> @rumtumtugnutz Yeah Windmill and the upgrade are super good too.
[1:01:45] <+Seitine> No you don't. Us old people forgot the good days.
[1:01:46] <%Daxalog> "Dont remind me of the my birthday" - Me
[1:01:47] <%st_jimmy456> correct
[1:01:50] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> so the freelancer skills ignore resistances, they just go through the raw defense stat, so shit like the german suplex can crit for like 3k-4k damage on higher levels
[1:01:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I WAS RAISED BY WHORES
[1:01:54] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm 10 in 2 months was the best
[1:01:57] <+DigitalPelican> That adult from before just tried to shakedown a 9 year old then huh
[1:01:58] <%OfficerMods> I'm dying hannibal
[1:02:00] <+PirateKefka> tbf, I'm not count this year as my 34th. I'm 33+1
[1:02:01] <Hoot_Patoots> whores and SOAP
[1:02:03] <olaksi> whore mothers
[1:02:10] <@SSaryn> @Too_Much_Nukie Ah ok, yeah it doesn't normally get everyone, but it just doing shit tons of damage at least to even 1 person, the damage is fucking GOOD.
[1:02:10] <watts121> I still don't remmeber how old I am day to day. 30-something.
[1:02:11] <+tigerfang86> ONLY PROSTITUTES
[1:02:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hero AoE isn;'t bad for early game either
[1:02:16] <%Broken_Sonex> Better than parents frankly Kappa
[1:02:21] <+CookieCutter007> whooors
[1:02:24] <stabbityrabbit> It takes a village to raise a child, and my village was WHORES
[1:02:24] <%starzo0> Whores, soap and dragon quest
[1:02:25] <%DappercatEsquire> DappercatEsquire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! hey pat i decided to finally get into yakuza with this game, only watched your LPs prior. beat it yesterday, probably my favorite game of the year, with a lot of messages i unironically needed to hear right now. thanks for introducing me to the game.
[1:02:25] <watts121> Oh shit I'm actually 41 now!
[1:02:27] <tsnakesrule> @WaifusSansFrontieres you forgot it has a chance to instant knock out
[1:02:29] <@SSaryn> Yeah Giga Swing is still an incredible skill.
[1:02:33] <%Yautjabutts> you think Ichi got a freebie when he became an adult?
[1:02:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[1:02:36] <%promessav2> sounds like a person
[1:02:37] <%Garthunox> yes
[1:02:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes he is.
[1:02:40] <%Leftovermemes> no
[1:02:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> But it's a little expensive
[1:02:43] <ToneBacas> dammit we almost made a kid stop wanting gifts
[1:02:43] <%Garthunox> the guy that shinada fights
[1:02:44] <@SSaryn> I feel like it but I can't even remember.
[1:02:53] <chaumiester> ..... Is he the character that everyone ignores?
[1:02:54] <%Broken_Sonex> You mean NOT-Tanimura
[1:03:02] <%promessav2> you'll have to fight her to buy it
[1:03:02] <Goodvibes99508> soapland?
[1:03:05] <olaksi> goddammit spoilers
[1:03:06] <%honeyman18> Well I'd call her and let her know
[1:03:07] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> How poor are they?
[1:03:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat don't take food out of the Piano Musics mouth
[1:03:09] <%walternatorz> then you don't give the kid money for fast food
[1:03:16] <%st_jimmy456> pat did you write this game?
[1:03:17] <djblue_shift> is it time to bet on whether pat
[1:03:17] <Pookiedaexzile> The Piano music has a family to feed
[1:03:18] <MarvelousMrD> and then the mom tries to kill you?
[1:03:20] <djblue_shift> is correct
[1:03:21] <%AzureGale> Dinner with the baseball glove
[1:03:22] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> and then goons will show up!
[1:03:22] <%McSoliace> sad music will play before then
[1:03:25] <%hoodedlefty> hoodedlefty subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! got this on in the background while I get back on the XIV wagon, want to at least my SCH relic up to date.
[1:03:26] <KingVantq> Gonna try a different job on Eri should I do Dealer or Matriach first?
[1:03:30] <Hoot_Patoots> what I love about the sad music is that it sounds like it could be on Eric Andre
[1:03:36] <%Jaxnos> i'm really hoping this just got crazy talked
[1:03:37] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> @tsnakesrule yup and I dont know the limits of that instakill, seems to be every non boss can just fucking melt from it
[1:03:39] <%juxtest> I sold my hands so that you wouldn't have to work so hard
[1:03:40] <tsnakesrule> Dealer for Eri
[1:03:48] <SomeOtherNeb> Megaman has to fight Donation Man
[1:03:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> All you need for a baseball glove is an old coat and a stapler
[1:03:51] <%promessav2> megumin..
[1:03:54] <NitronStreams> LUL
[1:03:56] <%AzureGale> It was a random encounter, lol
[1:03:57] <Hoot_Patoots> jesus christ Eri
[1:03:59] <redrins> I'd say night queen for eri, the damage is just too good
[1:04:01] <stabbityrabbit> I hope the fight for that subquest is just some dudes assuming Ichiban is a pedophile.
[1:04:01] <%BoxNavy> ???
[1:04:02] <SomeOtherNeb> he deserves it
[1:04:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Airstrike is my favorite AoE because it can also hit 1 target 3 times.
[1:04:04] <+RoeDeerRootie> Nanba has a concussion now

[1:12:38] <%Deft_Thought> Damn, Kasuga is a good guy
[1:12:41] <%JeanGardner99> Remember that chase mechanic the game taught you at the very start of the game, where'd that go?
[1:12:44] <%coastingtoast> @PatStaresAt how did you get the ps5 controller to work on pc? mine constantly disconnects on a wired connection
[1:12:54] <Hoot_Patoots> if there's one of my criticism for yakuza 7: i hope they fix inventory management and selling it for the sequel

[1:13:49] <iosephe> The orbital laser is so good
[1:13:53] <%Alazull> @Too_Much_Nukie He can get all the ones that aren't involved with substories, which is about half iirc
[1:13:54] <%coastingtoast> i did that with no luck still
[1:14:01] <@SSaryn> @NovaKnightmare Would have to be supported, which I doubt will happen for most games anyway.
[1:14:02] <Komayeda> I love that singing line
[1:14:05] <Blank9> the people's elbow
[1:14:08] <KingVantq> dont you have items that increase your MP by like 20?
[1:14:15] <+kidcoheed> Orbital Laser is Good, it's a AOE attack that does good damage, no use using it on one person
[1:14:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Ah fair fair
[1:14:16] <tsnakesrule> oh god my sound is so crusty, what did i do
[1:14:26] <%coreyyotto> while you're doing substories is a good time to level up Ichiban in a magic focused job like Host so you can boost his MP
[1:14:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean he's gotten all the ones he can buy, and he's doing all the substories as they appear.
[1:14:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good job
[1:14:27] <EL_TRO> this game is so damn good
[1:14:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If that's what you were asking.

[1:14:34] <%Jaxnos> you have a lot of yen for a homeless guy, Ichiban
[1:14:40] <@SSaryn> @tsnakesrule Refreshing could possibly help that.

[1:18:19] <%Jhylla81> His tiny hand are prefect for making crackers
[1:18:30] <%krispen_wa> KIWAMI MEANS EXTREME
[1:18:31] <redrins> Kiwami means extreme
[1:18:33] <+Dunmarkh> @Too_Much_Nukie WEIGHTED CLOTHING
[1:18:35] <%Freakin_Wolfy> you mean KIWAMI growth??????
[1:18:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh yeaaaah.
[1:18:46] <%SunnyVarietyPack> it does, I can get a job to level 20 no problem now
[1:18:49] <%Garthunox> so why not switch job?
[1:18:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I forgot she has the yakoozie training gear on.
[1:18:51] <%Jhylla81> kekaku means plan
[1:18:54] <%AzureGale> That's scaling, baby
[1:18:55] <%DappercatEsquire> there's a massive difficulty spike, twice
[1:18:55] <SomeOtherNeb> yeah no point in grinding yet
[1:18:56] <Blank9> the game originally had a job level cap of 30, it definitely scales hard
[1:18:58] <Hoot_Patoots> Yeah I would honestly recommend to not grind
[1:19:01] <%McSoliace> agreed
[1:19:01] <rbakervv> it's becuase you're fighting weaklings
[1:19:03] <tsnakesrule> Character experience is and will always be low, Legend mode will make sure jobs are lvl 99
[1:19:04] <Zarkith> You really never need to grind at all until chapter 12
[1:19:05] <%SunnyVarietyPack> not a bad idea
[1:19:09] <iosephe> You should be fine up until chapter 10 or something
[1:19:13] <%SunnyVarietyPack> agree
[1:19:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah serious grinding can wait until Kamurocho.
[1:19:14] <Komayeda> I've only had to grind like twice in this game so far
[1:19:15] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> you dont have to grind pat
[1:19:15] <KingVantq> Story shit gives tons of xp
[1:19:16] <watts121> Grinding aint' worth it until the last dungeon.
[1:19:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you want to get to ch 12 to grind
[1:19:19] <+kidcoheed> You need to hit the Dungeon and the Battle Arena
[1:19:22] <watts121> well last optional dungeon
[1:19:25] <EL_TRO> yeah it takes a while to rank jobs
[1:19:28] <+Wilabeen1997> There’ll be better grinding points yeah
[1:19:28] <lagon137> Mind goblins
[1:19:28] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Absolutely wait. The end game has a mechanic that lets your grind a job to level 30 in like 20 minutes. Then the next 60 levels takes hours
[1:19:30] <%OfficerMods> oh god chapter 12
[1:19:32] <smackdownbeef> You honestly never need to grind until post game
[1:19:34] <silentblast93> how gose the cracker buisness
[1:19:36] <redrins> there's two parts in the games where some enemies hit hard on your first playthrough so until then you'll be good
[1:19:37] <convo445> the exp arena will present itself eventually
[1:19:40] <%Bearphonics> Bearphonics subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months!
[1:19:41] <%bread_assassin> I like Namba's jog.
[1:19:46] <smackdownbeef> Just doing all the side content should get you to a high enough level
[1:19:47] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> no grinding required, its a sega rpg, just use your tools smartly
[1:19:51] <%Jaxnos> uh
[1:19:52] <%Garthunox> @smackdownbeef liar
[1:19:53] <Blank9> a single random encounter will get you from level 1 to 10 in a job later in the game
[1:19:56] <Hoot_Patoots> welp
[1:19:56] <%machshop> monkaS
[1:19:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt How do you feel about kimchi?
[1:19:58] <watts121> The best way to level is to use the Hobo Metal Slimes
[1:19:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hold that thought.
[1:19:59] <%Ipsenscastle> sawnic
[1:19:59] <PartyFavors> uh

[1:20:06] <SoySocks> spicy salaryman?
[1:20:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I told you dawg. This substory is weird.
[1:20:06] <%Jhylla81> Are there any compound jobs? As in, you need to max out certain jobs to unlock new ones?
[1:20:07] <%MoguManda> Whoa.
[1:20:08] <%OfficerMods> kimichi time
[1:20:09] <watts121> That only show up in the sewers.

[1:20:16] <+kidcoheed> @patstaresat Only the first 30 Levels of a Job Matter unless it's your permanent Job
[1:20:18] <%Bearphonics> WEll that man had a burny bum from the looks of it
[1:20:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> his butthole was on fire
[1:20:21] <%KineKithZen> I levelled a bunch of jobs to 10 and left it there
[1:20:21] <%machshop> yooo kimchi
[1:20:21] <%rdark_ksu> spicy food quest?
[1:20:21] <ManlyMcBeefington> oh boy
[1:20:21] <%AzureGale> Businessman got too freaky
[1:20:29] <%coreyyotto> In general, jobs level quicker early on, but after level 30 you basically need the exp up items to make any progress
[1:20:32] <Komayeda> I oughta try Kimchi at some point
[1:20:36] <%MoguManda> night kimchi
[1:20:39] <%Jhylla81> Smoke from MK became a saleryman
[1:20:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Who would buy this food?
[1:20:43] <%DappercatEsquire> i hope they iterate on the job system, give more jobs unique mechanics
[1:20:43] <stabbityrabbit> That man has got a pointy head.
[1:20:48] <tsnakesrule> Legend mode random encounters give 60-90k job exp, so no grinding is never a thing you do unless ya want to beat game easy
[1:20:49] <%condemned_15> look at that jpeg
[1:20:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This looks sketch as fuck.
[1:20:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That's some good kimchi jpeg

[1:21:05] <lastnamesilverlastname> kimchi.jpg
[1:21:07] <convo445> gotta go faster, faster
[1:21:07] <redrins> this is honestly one of the best sidequests in the game
[1:21:08] <%st_jimmy456> give it to grandma
[1:21:18] <%rdark_ksu> perfect
[1:21:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> butthole fire!
[1:21:25] <%FlakkLIVE> That Kimchi looks like I'd find it in an RE4 villager's cabin
[1:21:31] <%Lion_kun> I want to beat True Millennium Tower but the thought of grinding to max out 5 jobs per character sounds so daunting.
[1:21:36] <%machshop> hell yeah super spicy kimchi

[1:21:49] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> @tsnakesrule yeah, all that grinding really does in this game is make climactic fights lame

[1:22:57] <%Lion_kun> I heard that it'll take 20 hours of grinding Vagabonds to be able to attempt True Millennium Tower.
[1:22:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Bring back the pot.
[1:23:08] <Ravingpyro> kimchi time!!
[1:23:10] <%machshop> that ain't a shuffle
[1:23:11] <Blank9> a free pot too
[1:23:13] <%Jhylla81> Weaponize the Kimchi
[1:23:16] <tsnakesrule> Somehow I was able to get to the end on Legend mode being very underleveled
[1:23:18] <KingVantq> free food
[1:23:24] <%MoguManda> Hire the Kimchi
[1:23:24] <%honeyman18> Is that old man going to walk into the ocean or something
[1:23:41] <%Omegaanimus> just carry around a big ceramic pot of kimchi
[1:23:50] <%Jhylla81> make kimchi grenades
[1:23:52] <%Omegaanimus> nothing conspicuous, heavy, or inconvenient about it
[1:23:57] <%Alazull> Basically
[1:24:02] <%Broken_Sonex> @honeyman18 No the ocean would boil
[1:24:09] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat i finally watched curb your enthusiasm because of you and my girlfriend hates it because of how uncomfortable the situations are
[1:24:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> toilet man in the park needs Kimchi
[1:24:11] <%OfficerMods> hammer space
[1:24:15] <Blank9> cook boosts magic and agility stats permanently too, it's great for nanba
[1:24:15] <%Lion_kun> Pat, what were you saying about cost-effectiveness?
[1:24:24] <tsnakesrule> That would be a good idea, just grind that job off screen
[1:24:25] <%SunnyVarietyPack> he's better off homeless
[1:24:28] <%delilah4you> You were gonna give him MP Absorb
[1:24:32] <%MoguManda> maybe wait until he gets mana steal?
[1:24:35] <%delilah4you> We're all better off homeless
[1:24:46] <%wruce__billis> dress him up as majima
[1:24:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe its more like milestones?
[1:24:50] <ahaegotrigger> DO IT
[1:24:52] <%delilah4you> Wait until he gets mana absorb pat
[1:24:53] <%StaceMcGate> if you want levels, go to the sewers
[1:24:55] <%StaceMcGate> metal slimes
[1:25:00] <Pookiedaexzile> You might be bumping a soft cap
[1:25:00] <ahaegotrigger> the Majima outfit was so good LUL
[1:25:02] <%SunnyVarietyPack> OH NO MICHIO
[1:25:04] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Make them all beautiful, Pat
[1:25:06] <+Jrockoni> yo is Mr. Libido dead?
[1:25:06] <$RealThiele> allez! cuisine!
[1:25:09] <Blank9> mana steal is way too far off, 10 to 16 would be gated by plot progress essentially
[1:25:21] <+Gespens> ONO MICHIO
[1:25:22] <Blank9> since the exp growth will just go big later
[1:25:22] <%weissguard> O Nooooo
[1:25:26] <%AzureGale> The idol costume rules tho
[1:25:28] <MarvelousMrD> oops all ono michio
[1:25:29] <UlriktheSlayer1> SOME ARE SO COOL
[1:25:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Protip: You want multi-hit moves in the dungeon
[1:25:36] <%Broken_Sonex> I like how tacky they are
[1:25:45] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt dont just level hero job you only get Defense up from permanent stats
[1:25:45] <%eyezehuhh> karuooooo
[1:25:46] <%delilah4you> I guess MP Absorb isnt that strong, since basic attacks gives him mana back anyway
[1:25:51] <Blank9> always just use what class is fun at the time because exp you get now is nothing later on
[1:25:57] <%delilah4you> tarantoola
[1:26:01] <primarch_lupercal> adachi looks good in date costume
[1:26:01] <redrins> pat says spatula like dsp says tarantula LUL
[1:26:08] <%YakumoYomi> Spuh-TWO-la
[1:26:08] <$RealThiele> he will become iron chef japan
[1:26:17] <SomeOtherNeb> Hero job is the best for Kasuga, don't worry about it it's all you need
[1:26:20] <Blunder_Blue> Hero is honestly Ichi's best job yeah
[1:26:24] <%coreyyotto> Breaker is pretty good though
[1:26:24] <tsnakesrule> For kasuga yeah, hero is his best job
[1:26:28] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> guys dont feed the goblisn please
[1:26:29] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> LUL Does this game have turn based battles?
[1:26:30] <convo445> doesn't matter now
[1:26:32] <%McSoliace> does freelancer give you anything cool with ichiban?
[1:26:33] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat fortuneteller unlocks a good aoe spell
[1:26:36] <%coreyyotto> Breaker and Host offer the best character skills
[1:26:37] <%Lion_kun> you want to cycle through all jobs and unlock all the abilities.
[1:26:38] <%Garthunox> The job system seriously needs some work
[1:26:40] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Yeah, I beat the whole game and never changed his job
[1:26:41] <deckgreen> Defense also isn't bad for him, considering if he dies, game over
[1:26:44] <redrins> best thing to get is berserker and then just stay with hero imo
[1:26:50] <KingVantq> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots the entire game is turn based
[1:26:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Why do you need to grind
[1:26:53] <%KineKithZen> The cross-class skills are what makes it worthwhile
[1:26:55] <%Garthunox> @McSoliace Release German Suplex
[1:27:00] <uncle_speeps> ichi gets some useful skills from chef
[1:27:04] <tsnakesrule> Freelancer gives you Release german suplex which does a LOT of damage and can insta kill
[1:27:08] <%Joe2187> Chef has the best single enemy skill while Devil Rocker has an area skill that decimates
[1:27:10] <Hoot_Patoots> do the passive stats you get with jobs transfer ? I didn't think they did
[1:27:16] <+tigerfang86> big no
[1:27:21] <tsnakesrule> Yes they do
[1:27:22] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> @McSoliace freelancer skills arent effected by enemy damage type resistances and go through just the raw defense stat, the gemran suplex on my ichi can crit for 4k right now and its gonna keep going up
[1:27:24] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt just equip a job once to get level one and whatever linked move that comes with it
[1:27:26] <%Wiithan6> berserker is a great skill especially since you get it at like rank 4 bodyguard
[1:27:27] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @KingVantq carci1 carci2
[1:27:30] <$RealThiele> no shutup tho
[1:27:31] <%coreyyotto> they did reveal them in one of the trailers

[1:27:56] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Pfft, what a baby
[1:27:59] <+GingerStrawhat> Dats a lot of grinding
[1:28:00] <%AzureGale> Was she talking about an anime

[1:28:15] <%DappercatEsquire> you're right though @patstaresat you can save job switching for later, when the are good grinding options
[1:28:16] <SoySocks> oh no her s-senpai :c
[1:28:25] <%st_jimmy456> Studying abroad in december 2019 huh?? monkaS
[1:28:31] <Blank9> red skills transfer, the stat boosts that are in the list transfer, that's it

[1:28:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> sounds like you need to go fast
[1:28:49] <+tigerfang86> DO YOU WANT SOME KIMCHI

[1:29:14] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> @PatStaresAt in terms of exp value, literally no point grinding before chapter like 12, its an active waste of time, just doing substories and main story is the best exp gain right now, overworld enemies are worth nothing
[1:29:15] <tsnakesrule> and Each job gets like 2 Red skills
[1:29:17] <SoySocks> force her to run with spice
[1:29:18] <%caramelatte1> YESS

[1:55:22] <%AzureGale> This is some cool music
[1:55:23] <Spagheddies> Way too brilliant for this game, though.
[1:55:24] <%condemned_15> true if big
[1:55:24] <xbb1024> It doesn't take that much power
[1:55:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> those koreans and their secrets
[1:55:26] <%Garthunox> Thats a good theory
[1:55:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> HOLY SHIT

[1:55:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I hate when Pat is probably right
[1:55:34] <+xeros720> seriously, i can't hear the battle music that well at all on the ps4 version
[1:55:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[1:55:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> All the music in this dungeon is great
[1:55:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[1:55:42] <%walternatorz> I liked the KPOP account idea more.
[1:55:44] <+xeros720> does the pc version let you turn it up?
[1:55:44] <%KineKithZen> Biggest banger is yet to come
[1:55:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> possibly
[1:55:45] <+Seitine> Oh shit that does slap.
[1:55:45] <%Frost_Quill> That's the boring answer, I want giant kaiju robot battles.

[1:55:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Who started playing the Devil May cry Sound track
[1:55:52] <%slrls_> what is a riot shield if not a giant spatula
[1:55:52] <+PenmanLupine> everyones weak to spatulas Pat!
[1:55:54] <J_KoJima> hey masked jingweon
[1:55:54] <digitalbooklet> hell ye good tunes
[1:55:55] <$RealThiele> so am i
[1:55:57] <%Romuken> oh nice he got Nanba up to 19 on musician!
[1:55:59] <%walternatorz> Everyone is weak to spatulas
[1:56:03] <%penitentpendant> All those years of being a Short Order cooks left its scars
[1:56:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> That's something I kinda hate about the combat system. Most AoE attacks don't AoE if the enemies spread out.
[1:56:07] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Wow, this game looks incredible
[1:56:11] <%Omegaanimus> a dish to communicate with Space Korea?
[1:56:12] <oAznoUta> music in this game slaps so hard
[1:56:12] <thebalticguy1> Jingweon are all dead
[1:56:13] <%Alazull> Everything is a spatula if you try hard enough
[1:56:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Jingweon is disbanded.
[1:56:27] <librettodude> The amount of power on display seems a bit much for a broadcast antenna
[1:56:33] <%MonsterEnvy> These guys seem pretty vicious as well by the murder they didl
[1:56:36] <SomeOtherNeb> remember how everyone in Yakuza 2 was actualyl Korean?
[1:56:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Right when you switched all your classes
[1:56:37] <%shurtal> the jingweon went hard and never stopped, ever
[1:56:37] <smackdownbeef> Jingweon were killed TWICE
[1:56:39] <redrins> its also better than generic sewer
[1:56:39] <+zanzibar_junker> jingweon are more crazy
[1:56:39] <Blank9> jingweon were ex-special ops military in korea too, which is why they all cyanide instead of being caught
[1:56:41] <Jonny_Uppercut> Jingweon are the secret Koreans right?
[1:56:45] <h0wiewong> Jingweon got fucked up three separate times
[1:56:45] <tsnakesrule> Again, never needing to grind till you hit the block
[1:56:49] <+AlphaRayAllen> It wasn't bad
[1:56:55] <%Frost_Quill> No she didn't, she was shady as shit.
[1:56:55] <Coconosuga> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:57:10] <digitalbooklet> the level pacing in the game is pretty aight
[1:57:11] <h0wiewong> They all have a shaved head
[1:57:11] <%penitentpendant> Secret Korean Clone Factory upstairs!
[1:57:14] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So is that lady using us to beat up goons?
[1:57:17] <iosephe> The power lines are for their cloning program!
[1:57:21] <redrins> mainland jingweon never took a major hit tho
[1:57:22] <%heartlesshealer> ctrl+C, ctrl+V
[1:57:25] <+xeros720> hey pat, you look into skill shortcuts?
[1:57:27] <+pectusumbra> wait wait wait, Eri has SHADOW STICH?
[1:57:29] <%walternatorz> how dare they
[1:57:36] <%Omegaanimus> I love being Korean, so that way every Yakuza protag I control is a secret Korean
[1:57:36] <%Frost_Quill> Oh fuck she's not with them, she's just using us to take them out or some shit.
[1:57:45] <$RealThiele> budget stretch no jutsu
[1:57:48] <%mike2hands> GOOD TO SEE YOU WITH MORE Energy and well rested @PatStaresAt
[1:57:49] <tsnakesrule> shadow stich is a m a z i ng
[1:57:49] <%Bailey__gaming> ooh yay a pat stream to fall asleep watching yayyy
[1:57:49] <Ausk> this theme fucks
[1:57:55] <%heartlesshealer> Eri's a senbei ninja
[1:58:04] <%Daxalog> I wish triggering the evade was manual like the perfect block. But it costed a resource or something
[1:58:06] <%Zutrax> I'd recommend at some point grinding out to level 10 with the Host job for the only ice element move, a lot of bosses are weak to ice.
[1:58:06] <$TallYoda08> THATS A COOL BAT!!!!
[1:58:13] <%Omegaanimus> shadow stitch can be seriously op, like one hit kill
[1:58:17] <+Smdylan> man its haard for me watching this stream, i wanna play so bad yet i cant stop watching. plus its the first time catching you live
[1:58:26] <iosephe> There's an item EVERYWHERE in this game
[1:58:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Why grind he is already over powered.
[1:58:38] <tsnakesrule> Do both lol
[1:58:41] <%heartlesshealer> mushroom.....
[1:58:44] <%DappercatEsquire> did anyone tell pat how to get golden keys?
[1:58:50] <+pectusumbra> But man I need to play this myself
[1:58:58] <%StaceMcGate> Pat has golden keys
[1:58:59] <%baka_sugoi> free
[1:59:04] <%Alazull> That thumbtack move is a killer
[1:59:06] <convo445> some good shit coming up
[1:59:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @smdylan This dungeon is kind of important for the plot too.
[1:59:06] <$RealThiele> RIP those guys
[1:59:08] <%heartlesshealer> free
[1:59:16] <tsnakesrule> also if anyone should have the ice attack it should be nanba
[1:59:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> You get way too many skills to not use skill shortcuts
[1:59:33] <+Smdylan> oh shit
[1:59:35] <+xeros720> it's not super important, but it sure is nice to get an aoe move out in a second
[1:59:45] <SEN7IENT> i love nanba ice powers
[1:59:47] <uncle_speeps> shield bash is way better
[1:59:47] <Blank9> shield bash is best
[1:59:48] <%AzureGale> Unfortunately the skill shortcuts don't show the skill names
[1:59:53] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> you wanna have nanba dip into fortuneteller and host so he can grab all elemental spells
[1:59:53] <tsnakesrule> Sheild blast is better
[1:59:55] <olaksi> shield blast is a cone, it's good
[1:59:56] <digitalbooklet> pat upgraded the hero's bat up to the extra hits already? dang
[2:00:00] <%Garthunox> shield blast is fantastic
[2:00:02] <h0wiewong> Thumbtacks
[2:00:02] <%Zutrax> Paralysis Prongs is so fucking powerful on Enforcer.
[2:00:09] <+xeros720> thumbtack scatter is Eri's aoe
[2:00:19] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> @digitalbooklet used dlc cheat items to do it
[2:00:20] <+Smdylan> im out guess ill catch the vod ;)
[2:00:22] <Kiaayo> We started playing this game at around the same time and i was afraid of watching your stream for fear of spoilers, but i just started chapter 15 so i guess that fear was unfounded.
[2:00:27] <%heartlesshealer> shadow stitch is single target
[2:00:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shadow Stitch is your boss killer for Eri. For a while at least.
[2:00:43] <%penitentpendant> Up AoE, Down Single Target, Left Buff, Right Debuff/Heal?
[2:00:44] <olaksi> START OVER
[2:00:49] <$RealThiele> yes
[2:00:50] <%Daxalog> Koichi is so mana intensive
[2:00:51] <digitalbooklet> @waifussansfrontieres ahh, its not like it takes very long if you have the company money but dang LOL
[2:00:53] <+xeros720> now you're good
[2:01:02] <%StaceMcGate> and you'll have to reassign these shortcuts everytime you change jobs
[2:01:06] <%DappercatEsquire> @kiaayo i did the same thing, just beat it just night
[2:01:07] <+loukemia83> Fearless Command so good
[2:01:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> ALL ALLIES
[2:01:13] <%Zutrax> It's really annoying that you have to set skills every time you change jobs. Even when switching back to one you already set.
[2:01:18] <%HitchhikingThrough> I saw it
[2:01:19] <Dr00_PhD> Endless desire
[2:01:28] <Blank9> I put different attack types on different shortcuts eventually
[2:01:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Endless Desire is a team regen buff
[2:01:33] <%Garthunox> transfer shield is god awful
[2:01:34] <%StaceMcGate> Shield bash is the best physical aoe in the game
[2:01:36] <digitalbooklet> everyone puts saeko as idol but isnt she a better single target mage / hostess? :o
[2:01:38] <%StaceMcGate> shit kills whole mobs
[2:01:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @digitalbooklet Ye
[2:01:54] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt endless desire is a team aoe on namba
[2:01:57] <Blank9> saeko's good at both
[2:01:58] <uncle_speeps> hostess isn't a great class
[2:01:59] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:02:01] <%StaceMcGate> Eri has slightly better physical stats than Saeko
[2:02:05] <redrins> it is a hitachi wand
[2:02:07] <Dr00_PhD> It's great
[2:02:11] <%coreyyotto> its lewd
[2:02:11] <+coldsama> @digitalbooklet i agree, Eri have default good stats in heals even

[2:03:22] <%AzureGale> It was at this moment that he knew... he fucked up
[2:03:31] <%MonsterEnvy> In fact why did you grind this out
[2:03:32] <digitalbooklet> this is why ichiban still has no money
[2:03:40] <%QueequegTheater> What does sapphire steak taste like

[2:04:05] <digitalbooklet> roof kimchi
[2:04:06] <HeavenlyBrush> first time seeing this game i didn't realize it was a jrpg lol
[2:04:08] <%QueequegTheater> Is it your lack of skill
[2:04:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> Time to RECALIBRATE
[2:04:25] <HeavenlyBrush> are other yakuza games this goofy as well?
[2:04:28] <%Zutrax> BANDING
[2:04:29] <%heartlesshealer> ooooh
[2:04:31] <%burkey0307> color banding
[2:04:31] <+jt427> what tv do you have?
[2:04:32] <+Pyroclase> Oh man, I hate calibrating my TV
[2:04:32] <tsnakesrule> yes
[2:04:35] <%Omegaanimus> it's funny...people have been saying Yakuza is a JRPG for years
[2:04:36] <digitalbooklet> pat take a selfie
[2:04:41] <astrophizz> banding
[2:04:41] <KingVantq> yes @HeavenlyBrush
[2:04:45] <$RealThiele> RIP banding
[2:04:48] <%Omegaanimus> and now people see it since they made the combat turn based
[2:04:50] <+Pyroclase> it kinda looks like that on my second monitor too
[2:04:51] <%Garthunox> @HeavenlyBrush no they're usually pretty serious...
[2:04:53] <%heartlesshealer> take a selfie at the illegal phone tower
[2:05:00] <thesubgenius912> the worst is when it is on the black part of the images
[2:05:02] <%Alazull> Hey look the cables look like a spider's web
[2:05:03] <%penitentpendant> The smoothest gradients!
[2:05:06] <Jnkolm> The other games are goofy yea, but this one is a lot more dull gameplay-wise
[2:05:07] <%AzureGale> Never get high
[2:05:08] <%QueequegTheater> @HeavenlyBrush In order to get Saejima's abilities in Yakuza 4 you have to punch rocks to stop them from falling on an old man
[2:05:15] <%Omegaanimus> not phone, space, to contact home planet Space Korea
[2:05:20] <HeavenlyBrush> i never played any yakuza games and thought they were like open world games gta style lmaao
[2:05:28] <+coldsama> @omegaanimus in a lot of aspects it was, now more than ever
[2:05:29] <%QueequegTheater> @Garthunox I can't hear you over the secret Koreans
[2:05:32] <$RealThiele> banding makes combat too complicated
[2:05:33] <tsnakesrule> jump loser
[2:05:36] <SEN7IENT> kill
[2:05:37] <%Nekros4442> eh, I think this combat system is a massive upgrade so far
[2:05:40] <%eyezehuhh> @HeavenlyBrush big sandbox!
[2:05:44] <%AzureGale> You're gonna have to juuuUUUuuu,p
[2:05:46] <HeavenlyBrush> that's amazing i might actually give these games a try now
[2:05:59] <KingVantq> yes
[2:06:02] <SomeOtherNeb> oh fuck I never came back to the other side of that
[2:06:03] <%PanicSwytch> No turning back?
[2:06:08] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater I CANT HEAR YOU OVER THE SECRET CHINESE!
[2:06:09] <%MonsterEnvy> yes
[2:06:10] <%Zutrax> You cant go back after crossing.

[2:21:10] <smackdownbeef> It's always useful
[2:21:10] <FredWorthy> The florist would be proud
[2:21:11] <%OfficerMods> it's like pottery
[2:21:12] <%Garthunox> this time its the koreans
[2:21:13] <StarlitStunner> Brother Eye
[2:21:13] <OswaldTheDog> why change what works?
[2:21:17] <%linSP> Is that TV 8k?
[2:21:19] <eco419> D:
[2:21:21] <+Pyroclase> THAT'S what you take issue with, Ichiban?
[2:21:22] <%Esparsenior> This is so ineffective to monitor people. You can’t even watch some of them
[2:21:23] <%Bailey__gaming> A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.??!?
[2:21:25] <iosephe> The Florist but a mafia
[2:21:25] <ketchuo13> Say, what happen to the Florist
[2:21:26] <@SSaryn> There's a reaon.
[2:21:28] <%T_Sasquatch> Where's the floristttt
[2:21:29] <SEN7IENT> you have to jack off?
[2:21:29] <eco419> yes
[2:21:31] <%reonome> gas is expensive man
[2:21:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @strawberrypantsu Well Vergil is in the room
[2:21:31] <%MonsterEnvy> They are new
[2:21:32] <digitalbooklet> see he feels bad, he's hot and feels bad
[2:21:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> aesthetic Pat
[2:21:34] <%toastybites> literally just call the city and report it
[2:21:34] <%Omegaanimus> But this uses Korean made electronics
[2:21:34] <redrins> dont worry about it
[2:21:35] <%baka_sugoi> All these TVs and there only 4k pfff
[2:21:35] <%stantashev> No money for generators
[2:21:36] <oAznoUta> because all the wires looks cool
[2:21:37] <+zzNamttamzz> Eri's like I'm out...
[2:21:38] <LunarRemix> I'm guessing there's only so much you can do with generators?
[2:21:39] <primarch_lupercal> wajf for it
[2:21:41] <sponsoredviewer910> additional pylons
[2:21:41] <%Minicow1> Or just... buy electricity?
[2:21:44] <+loukemia83> gas is expensive
[2:21:45] <+MasterCosmic> There loud asf
[2:21:46] <MarvelousMrD> its also not how security cameras work
[2:21:47] <SEN7IENT> they all got banned from Home Depot
[2:21:48] <Blank9> spying is fine, but stealing electricity is too rude
[2:21:49] <tanarath> just get industrial solar generators
[2:21:50] <xbb1024> They should build their own nuclear plant
[2:21:50] <%Omegaanimus> rigged surveillance by LG
[2:21:51] <digitalbooklet> information doesnt pay the bills
[2:21:55] <%juxtest> They cant afford generators after they bought all these TVs
[2:21:56] <%QueequegTheater> gas is expensive
[2:21:56] <h0wiewong> Yeah they're the smallest group
[2:21:57] <%DappercatEsquire> it's a grey zone, who the fucks gonna do something about it
[2:21:58] <tanarath> and batteries
[2:21:59] <$vincerocmm> st3al 1t all
[2:22:01] <%Piemono> Wouldn't it be pretty easy to fuck with the power cables?
[2:22:01] <$RealThiele> in jpn yea
[2:22:07] <+Dunmarkh> that's still spying
[2:22:10] <+pectusumbra> It's probably a matter of paper trails more than anything
[2:22:10] <%Bailey__gaming> this lair needs a 12 foot skeleton
[2:22:13] <%Dementedpenguin> Erm
[2:22:14] <+MasterCosmic> That guy buying porn
[2:22:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> SNITCH POWER
[2:22:17] <%Omegaanimus> I dunno, Koreans just left with little to no resources aren't good with nuclear power
[2:22:21] <%OfficerMods> if you dont like it build your own power plant
[2:22:21] <Dr00_PhD> More snitching
[2:22:25] <eco419> The Public Store?
[2:22:28] <SEN7IENT> tampering with security cameras is definitely illegal
[2:22:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> the power of snitching
[2:22:34] <%penitentpendant> Man, so many Snitches in this storyline
[2:22:35] <+AlphaRayAllen> "I'll tell on you" the org
[2:22:35] <Ner234> Snitch Lords
[2:22:35] <SomeOtherNeb> we're GOOD murderers
[2:22:38] <+Corvan> but what about the dude shaking down the bums
[2:22:42] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> so you fucked up then, huh han?
[2:22:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> So many parts of this game is just "snitching is STRONG"
[2:22:49] <krin_x> this seems really dumb
[2:22:50] <%juxtest> That Liumang guy was shaking down bums on Seiryu territory though and nobody did anything about that
[2:22:50] <tsnakesrule> YEAH
[2:22:55] <tsnakesrule> ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE
[2:22:57] <%TenderBabyBacon> SNEAKY KOREANS
[2:22:58] <%penitentpendant> Ichiban, "Can someone learn this power?"
[2:22:58] <%eyezehuhh> This is wrong Mr. Wayne
[2:22:58] <+loukemia83> the ESSENCE of Snitching
[2:22:59] <digitalbooklet> snitching is good the plot of Y7
[2:23:00] <%QueequegTheater> UNLiMITED SNITCH WORKS
[2:23:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Always Snitch
[2:23:04] <+Seitine> That's wy he saved ya'll LUL
[2:23:06] <%critikal_bit> ALWAYS SNITCH
[2:23:10] <Spagheddies> Geomijul be like SillyChamp
[2:23:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> Ichiban kasuga: Friend of hot Snitch Koreans
[2:23:13] <+SammyOVision> The SNEAKRET KOREANS
[2:23:14] <+Seitine> Snitches gotta stick together LUL
[2:23:16] <%ShoggothLibrarian> Snitchiban is too powerful
[2:23:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> @SEN7IENT But he said they installed their own cameras so they're not tampering with anything, technically.
[2:23:21] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt I have seen people compare them to Elves.
[2:23:21] <iosephe> The Snitch Mafia
[2:23:22] <%Alazull> I am the bone of my snitch
[2:23:27] <$RealThiele> kill the batman
[2:23:27] <xbb1024> They silent
[2:23:27] <Jnkolm> Snitchit would be the most powerful pokemon of them all
[2:23:28] <digitalbooklet> ichiban x vergil
[2:23:29] <+Seitine> Maybe cheaper?
[2:23:31] <Saltmeisterr> he's a ranger
[2:23:32] <%caramelatte1> Silent and cheap probably.
[2:23:32] <tsnakesrule> he gun man
[2:23:33] <krin_x> crossbows are classy
[2:23:34] <h0wiewong> Subtly?
[2:23:34] <+Dunmarkh> they're not loud
[2:23:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> Guns are much harder to get, I guess
[2:23:35] <smackdownbeef> Cus it's cool
[2:23:35] <librettodude> crossbows are silent and intimidating I guess
[2:23:36] <%coreyyotto> crossbows make no noise
[2:23:36] <%McSoliace> everyone does in your eyes pat
[2:23:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> crossbows are quieter and easier to manufacture ammo for?
[2:23:37] <eco419> D:
[2:23:37] <+PenmanLupine> crossbows are silent
[2:23:39] <SomeOtherNeb> a Yakuza characte rwould never use guns Pat you're wrong
[2:23:43] <digitalbooklet> crossbows are not illegal
[2:23:44] <tanarath> Quiet, not illegal
[2:23:45] <SaltyAzteca> Behold the viewing globe!!
[2:23:46] <+estefufu> nani?
[2:23:48] <%Bailey__gaming> he's a decent party dude
[2:23:49] <mandalor89> crossbows arent regulated in japan i think
[2:23:50] <%sumrand0> Crossbow= silent & no gunpowder residue
[2:23:50] <$RealThiele> less jail time in jpn
[2:23:52] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> its a rank thing, cooler people get guns
[2:23:52] <%penitentpendant> The most surprising Untwist in the story so far
[2:23:52] <+PenmanLupine> crossbows are silent, but also probably easier to get since they aren't illegal
[2:23:55] <%starzo0> @MonsterEnvy holyshit they're totally elves
[2:23:56] <%OfficerMods> big proof
[2:24:01] <%MonsterEnvy> Both Legal and Silent

[2:38:28] <SomeOtherNeb> Nanba is the REAL hero
[2:38:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They don't need your permission to kill you.
[2:38:29] <%Bailey__gaming> Friendship Ended with Namba, now the Koreans are my best friend
[2:38:30] <dukenux> when someone's holding you on gunpoint
[2:38:30] <digitalbooklet> they owe him for the 6 months of hobo

[2:47:50] <+ProfessorPuzzle> There was that one girl in 4 you sparred with though
[2:47:52] <eco419> D;
[2:47:54] <%penitentpendant> Only a one on one lady fight?
[2:47:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They should put her in the fight but give her a buff that makes her only attackable by female characters
[2:47:57] <digitalbooklet> the major difference between ichiban's sexual tension is more vocal than kiryu
[2:47:58] <valriot> the crossbows LUL

[3:04:09] <Brunty023> Breaker is good shit!
[3:04:10] <2BitHeroics> hero is his best
[3:04:10] <+tigerfang86> that's pretty good
[3:04:10] <digitalbooklet> HOST
[3:04:10] <%Zutrax> Hero is actually his best, but do host to get ice element
[3:04:12] <%KShirahama> HERO
[3:04:12] <ShawnEXE> breaker is pretty good but hero is the best job
[3:04:12] <uncle_speeps> get chef skills
[3:04:14] <Lucasleonava> Hero, but Bodyguard has Katana
[3:04:14] <orjin_streams> HERO IS BEST
[3:04:15] <%QueequegTheater> WHICH ONE LOOKS FUNNIEST
[3:04:16] <SomeOtherNeb> I leveled him up as a Bodybuilder/Breaker too

[3:04:19] <+loukemia83> Breaker is good
[3:04:20] <redrins> he gets those passively pat
[3:04:20] <%yeknomlive> yeah get hyper swagger
[3:04:20] <skinmansgds> Changing is always good for permanent stat boosts
[3:04:21] <+AlphaRayAllen> GET ICE SPREADER FROM HOST
[3:04:21] <%Prossy> breaker too good
[3:04:22] <%StaceMcGate> you 100% wanna go Host
[3:04:22] <h0wiewong> Hyper swagger is good
[3:04:22] <+tigerfang86> Self buff is pretty good
[3:04:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ice Spreader SUCKS
[3:04:25] <GigaSeifer> ice spreader is decent
[3:04:26] <KnightAsteran> BREAKER
[3:04:26] <%LuckyLagomorph> SUPLEX
[3:04:26] <%Broken_Sonex> SUPLEX
[3:04:27] <SEN7IENT> swag
[3:04:27] <Hoot_Patoots> ice spreader is very useful
[3:04:27] <+loukemia83> Host is magic
[3:04:28] <%McSoliace> be the sbreaker
[3:04:29] <digitalbooklet> HOST FOR MORE MAGIC
[3:04:30] <%coreyyotto> Ice Spreader is OP

[3:04:33] <$Skelemungus> suplex is really good
[3:04:34] <wanderingdain90> its poop
[3:04:35] <stabbityrabbit> How bout that Devil Rocker?
[3:04:35] <Spagheddies> Foreman gives you access to Gold Keys.
[3:04:35] <Hoot_Patoots> lmao
[3:04:35] <redrins> by the end of the game you will have suplex without even using freelancer pat
[3:04:36] <HeavenlyBrush> may give enemy cold
[3:04:38] <+ZeddySpaghetti90> how is Suplex not the answer!?
[3:04:38] <HeavenlyBrush> lmao
[3:04:38] <+GingerStrawhat> Host is really good if you need an elementalist
[3:04:39] <%coreyyotto> Host or Breaker is my vote
[3:04:42] <SomeOtherNeb> Foreman is only good for HP/MP I think
[3:04:42] <eco419> be a pop group
[3:04:42] <%Zutrax> Foreman has a fire element move you learn
[3:04:43] <orjin_streams> Save Host
[3:04:44] <%McSoliace> become the breaker

[3:04:55] <%StaceMcGate> I beg of you...choose Host
[3:04:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> blow?
[3:04:56] <uncle_speeps> peppermill blow is super strong
[3:04:56] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> breaker is great
[3:04:57] <+loukemia83> Breaker

[3:04:58] <+FackuIkari> BREAKER
[3:04:59] <+tigerfang86> Host

[3:05:11] <%VHGS> it does a SHITLOAD of damage
[3:05:11] <+GingerStrawhat> Like Breaker has the best area of effect physical move in the game
[3:05:11] <shieldecho> Host looks GREAT
[3:05:12] <ateeeeez> breaker is better for ichi's general stats
[3:05:13] <skinmansgds> Host is pretty versatile
[3:05:14] <%Zutrax> He's generally bad at host since his magic is lower. Hero is his best class.
[3:05:14] <+zzNamttamzz> breaker is cool
[3:05:14] <%SunnyVarietyPack> breaker

[3:05:54] <redrins> way worse than the bat
[3:05:58] <+GingerStrawhat> YOU TURNED HIM INTO SHINY KIRYU!!?!?!?!?
[3:06:01] <%QueequegTheater> ONO MICHI THO
[3:06:07] <+tigerfang86> YEAAAAAAAAAAH
[3:06:08] <GigaSeifer> put both on
[3:06:10] <%penitentpendant> Test if they stack?
[3:06:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> You don't want 2x xp instead of 1.5x?
[3:06:11] <+tigerfang86> SO FANCY
[3:06:11] <Blank9> put TWO on
[3:06:11] <h0wiewong> Nice
[3:06:12] <olaksi> equip 2
[3:06:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ohp there
[3:06:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> WAIT THOSE STACK?!
[3:06:21] <GigaSeifer> just toss those business cards out
[3:06:22] <%zajoestar> I kinda feel bad that I didn't mess with the job system at all in the game, the base classes for everyone carried me the whole way
[3:06:24] <+AlphaRayAllen> Nope
[3:06:25] <Dr00_PhD> Put on 2 for double xp
[3:06:26] <GigaSeifer> like oprah
[3:06:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> You do not have an Enforcer one
[3:06:32] <%BaybeeBat> if you give flowers to the job lady, engineer, school receiptionist and the bar girl at survive good things happen
[3:06:33] <+zzNamttamzz> 2 fancy cards PogChamp
[3:06:34] <%Daxalog> @commanderclaw any idea how to access the sub discord?
[3:06:35] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt only one enforcer job accessory, and its a substory in chapter 12
[3:06:35] <NeroInfinite> nope
[3:06:35] <eco419> no
[3:06:37] <Blank9> double the business cards, double the JP
[3:06:39] <+loukemia83> You do not have it yet
[3:06:40] <$Skelemungus> it should be a medal
[3:06:41] <%nanaki_ff14> I love you Pat! But I have missed most the stream so I will have to catch the VOD latter! Do big hero crimes!
[3:06:41] <skinmansgds> Equip both cards, Host doesn't do a lot of direct damage anyway
[3:06:42] <%coreyyotto> i think its linked to a substory
[3:06:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Substory I think?
[3:06:45] <%venomryu> @PatStaresAt i also hope you chat had a good thanksgiving as well
[3:06:50] <Brunty023> I think the Enforcer one is tied to a substory
[3:06:56] <Blank9> enforcer is a sidequest reward
[3:06:57] <%coreyyotto> one per new game cycle
[3:06:58] <%Bailey__gaming> I've not tried enforcer
[3:06:59] <digitalbooklet> @zajoestar the base classes are legit good but you get variety from the shared skills you learn from other classes, highly recommend job hopping
[3:06:59] <SPidERMan8576> Is pat going to buy 100 ff14 chocolates for the mount??
[3:07:01] <+tigerfang86> Pat Sads At
[3:07:01] <+possumwalsh1221> Some of them are substory rewards
[3:07:02] <eco419> BabyRage
[3:07:03] <%Garthunox> if there's only 1 its substory related
[3:07:06] <+GingerStrawhat> There's only one in the game and it's later on
[3:07:11] <%mield916> go to the secret shop near the sex restaurant for adachi
[3:07:14] <@commanderclaw> @Daxalog Make sure to sync your Discord with your Twitch account
[3:07:19] <orjin_streams> make Ichiban a Freelancer
[3:07:21] <+AlphaRayAllen> OPTIMAL
[3:07:22] <Blank9> big JP big power
[3:07:24] <+chiazam> GRIND
[3:07:30] <orjin_streams> Dumb wrestling stuff is great
[3:07:31] <%AzureGale> Woop woop
[3:07:33] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt the only other job accessories are in the casino
[3:07:35] <digitalbooklet> JOB GRIND BEFORE ORGY
[3:07:36] <%penitentpendant> Now, to test, for science!
[3:07:39] <%Bailey__gaming> freelancer sucks ass
[3:07:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Do story
[3:07:40] <+zzNamttamzz> big exps
[3:07:46] <Blank9> freelancer is only worth when you grind metal slimes
[3:07:49] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt yep, you buy them with tokens
[3:07:50] <%Daxalog> @commanderclaw How do? Is that via Discord or Twitch itself?
[3:07:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> You already got all the casino ones
[3:07:57] <%VHGS> and from side stories
[3:08:01] <%Bailey__gaming> dealer is v good
[3:08:01] <%coreyyotto> then you must already have them
[3:08:01] <tsnakesrule> Freelancer is fine for the red move
[3:08:02] <wanderingdain90> freelancer is trash
[3:08:03] <+tigerfang86> Freelancer has a ton of handy stuff to take out of it's job
[3:08:03] <SPidERMan8576> Harem story
[3:08:05] <%mield916> No the secret shop is where all other job accessories are
[3:08:08] <redrins> one of the ultimate weapons base form you get from the casino btw iirc
[3:08:10] <digitalbooklet> eri literally tapped that man and killed him
[3:08:11] <h0wiewong> Oh yeah shortcuts again
[3:08:22] <+goddamndavid> imagine get tapped by a ruler and INSTANTLY DYING
[3:08:24] <%penitentpendant> I'm glad the skills from THE BUSINESS DIMENSION are class neutral
[3:08:25] <+GingerStrawhat> I've already beaten the game but I wanna replay it and use the jobs I never really used much like Dealer and Fortuneteller
[3:08:26] <Blank9> you'll get more MP eventually for that laser
[3:08:27] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Fix your shortcuts again
[3:08:35] <@commanderclaw> @Daxalog You go into the settings of your Discord, and click on the connections tab
[3:08:36] <+tigerfang86> Oh nooooooooo

[3:31:34] <+AlphaRayAllen> COMMIT CRIME TO STOP CRIME
[3:31:34] <NastiCrimeboy> annoyingForreal
[3:31:35] <%McSoliace> so kill the politician
[3:31:42] <+tigerfang86> yea a Japanese Liberal Party is super not liberal to the western definition
[3:31:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I can't wait to see how this ties into all that stuff you did chapter 1.
[3:31:46] <%QueequegTheater> @mortificent Other countries aren't real
[3:31:50] <StarlitStunner> nemuYan1 I see, I see
[3:31:50] <+SilverDevilfish> Remember when Kiryu destroyed Japan's economy
[3:31:55] <+supersonic21> The fact that I didn’t consider that all the money in this game could potentially be fake is kinda shocking
[3:31:58] <+Jaysky> Corrupt politicians, where are the Phantom thieves?
[3:31:59] <%Blackleafx> @tigerfang86 de-facto 1 party state, bby
[3:32:08] <%Blackleafx> @SilverDevilfish wasnt that majima, because he spoke ot that tax guy
[3:32:10] <+supersonic21> Witch makes those millions from management useless
[3:32:11] <SomeOtherNeb> what a good guy counterfeiter
[3:32:11] <Kisiel250> wouldn't making fake money for 60 years mess up economy a bit?
[3:32:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's actually smart minus the illegal activity LUL
[3:32:16] <mortificent> the Japanese Liberals are super right wing iirc
[3:32:19] <%Movemeister> Counterfeiting for the children
[3:32:21] <%promessav2> i assume they actuaklly mean lib dem
[3:32:22] <GigaSeifer> this is how Kiryu ends up with billions of yen so easily, Japan's economy is fake
[3:32:34] <Komayeda> This plot could be solved if Akiyama were here
[3:32:42] <CelestialCage> @SilverDevilfish Kiryu only established a monopoly. Majima helped create the tax that wrecked the conomy
[3:32:45] <%reonome> ACAB
[3:32:45] <%penitentpendant> Paying off the cops with fake money seems like a stupid plan?
[3:32:46] <SomeOtherNeb> why do you THINK Ichi
[3:32:48] <dukenux> liberalism is generally on the right side of the political spectrum in most countries
[3:32:50] <%QueequegTheater> Wait does this mean all Japanese money has been counterfeit for 60 years
[3:32:52] <+tigerfang86> Akiyama, master of all money, would easily solve this problem
[3:32:55] <%Piemen99> very true
[3:32:56] <skyentombment> Man, I can't get over the fact that Saeko is dressed up like she's on a date while hanging out with literal piss hobos
[3:32:56] <%TubeMan642> ACAB
[3:32:58] <Sol_Install> so true
[3:32:59] <+chiazam> ACAB

[3:44:16] <HedgehogGames1> "You weren't supposed to watch the trailers."
[3:44:17] <Dr00_PhD> I didn't watch any trailers specifically because of stuff like that
[3:44:20] <CelestialCage> Han was popular in 6

[3:45:16] <huskarl_zap> This excuse to white wash the Geomijull
[3:45:18] <MasterTonberry23> Thank God you have Eri or this would be a lot harder
[3:45:18] <rafflespaddock> How easy it is to leave the Geomijul
[3:45:19] <%BIumen> well of course the rogue is an archer

[3:45:21] <%rasterman> you can tell the writers forgot that they set this guy up earlier
[3:45:21] <HedgehogGames1> This guy's had his own plot going on offscreen.
[3:45:21] <PartyFavors> "It's fine you're allowed to like Seung Hui"
[3:45:22] <orjin_streams> See, this is why they can't tell people about the counterifiter
[3:45:22] <%promessav2> he's weak to ground pounds
[3:45:23] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt the whole point of this is to make sure you know Joon-Gi didn't kill someone
[3:45:23] <Spagheddies> THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW
[3:45:25] <Hoot_Patoots> GET INSIDE
[3:45:27] <%Blackleafx> kick him into the building

[3:45:39] <+loukemia83> The party really does just beat up one guy

[3:45:47] <%heartlesshealer> the sliding doors opened in the middle of the attack LUL
[3:45:47] <%Jaller101514> This is to redeem the Geomigul for being scary earlier

[3:45:48] <huskarl_zap> HAs he done Sojimaru yet?
[3:45:50] <%owazowski> BEAT HIM INSIDE

[4:10:27] <+JonathLP> WHAT
[4:10:27] <%bread_assassin> This game is all Daigo’s fault.
[4:10:31] <%dave323dave> what about terada?
[4:10:31] <+CookieCutter007> Daigo LUL
[4:10:32] <+JonathLP> What is this slander against Daigo?
[4:10:34] <+GingerStrawhat> He's lasted the longest
[4:10:36] <Spagheddies> Big Redemptions.
[4:10:36] <+xeros720> ahaha seriously, everything happens with Daigo there
[4:10:36] <orjin_streams> Dammit Daigo
[4:10:37] <%Broken_Sonex> GOD, FUCK DAIGO
[4:10:37] <%NovaKnightmare> Daigo never stopped fucking up
[4:10:37] <rafflespaddock> but he survived
[4:10:38] <+GenesisKnight> Kiryu needs to stop going away
[4:10:39] <thebalticguy1> DAIGO DID NOTHING WRONG
[4:10:39] <%kewlmyc> Nah, the one that attempted the rape in the first game is the worst
[4:10:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE WORST
[4:10:40] <eco419> Why?
[4:10:40] <Blank9> daigo tried
[4:10:43] <MasterTonberry23> I cant believe the Tojo lasted as long as it did under Daigo
[4:10:43] <+rainlily1245> what about fucking terada
[4:10:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Didn't Terada try to directly betray the Tojo
[4:10:44] <Iwashi94> Daddy ArakUwU
[4:10:45] <redrins> daigo is alright
[4:10:45] <sandsim> good job daigo
[4:10:45] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt there was literally a chairman who tried to destroy the tojo from within
[4:10:45] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Yakuza 3 to 5 were all his fault
[4:10:45] <%T_Sasquatch> Diago didn't FUCKING want it. Its KIRYUS FAULT
[4:10:46] <%Garthunox> How is that his fault though?
[4:10:47] <randomahole> @eco419 dad noods?
[4:10:47] <+GingerStrawhat> Outside of the first two I guess
[4:10:47] <+supersonic21> it also happened with aoki in charge i assume?
[4:10:49] <%ghostmcfly6> That's the guy who put me, in the hospital...
[4:10:50] <+Zaku306> daigo is a jobber
[4:10:50] <+JonathLP> Terada literally betrayed the clan to the Jingweon
[4:10:50] <%Grimlockfly> KIRYU DID ALL THIS GODDAMN WORK IN SIX GAMES AND THIS HAPPEN
[4:10:50] <+talkingrain3139> PAT YOU CRIED FOR DAIGO
[4:10:51] <CelestialCage> Americans tend to love dunking on Daigo
[4:10:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Can't Counter that, Daigos the worst
[4:10:52] <%NovaKnightmare> YES HE DID
[4:10:52] <%seraphimjordan> yep
[4:10:53] <COMB711> He wears a cool coat though
[4:10:54] <%OfficerMods> I be Diego has a good reason, he'd never intentionally kill the tojo
[4:10:56] <blue8moon> It all makes sense! I think
[4:10:57] <+tigerfang86> nice moves Daigo
[4:10:57] <CelestialCage> He was a VILLAIN IN YAKUZA 4
[4:10:58] <%starzo0> @JonathLP only if its false
[4:10:58] <orjin_streams> Daigo was handed a broken mess and told "Good Luck Kiddo"
[4:10:59] <+tigerfang86> great work
[4:11:00] <rafflespaddock> in 4 yes
[4:11:00] <eco419> oh
[4:11:00] <%Yamchadassist> im playin through kiwami 2 and so far daigo cool LMAO
[4:11:01] <h0wiewong> He was trying to hold a sinking ship
[4:11:01] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> But it was all worth it for the perfect parry against Chun-Li
[4:11:02] <ateeeeez> well if he did a good job we wouldn't have got all these crazy ass games
[4:11:02] <%T_Sasquatch> Kiryu literally shoved that shit on daigo
[4:11:03] <hassanico2> HE WORKED WITH MUNAKATA
[4:11:03] <%Blackleafx> NANOMACHINES SON
[4:11:03] <%Jaromero435> BUT KIRYU WROTE THAT LETTER TO HIM LUL
[4:11:06] <CelestialCage> @PatStaresAt He was a VILLAIN IN YAKUZA 4
[4:11:07] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Remember when Daigo was a shitty kid?
[4:11:08] <+ZipperHands> Any chairman would get fucked by the shit in Yakuza
[4:11:08] <huskarl_zap> Diago "Never shake a blanka's players hand."
[4:11:10] <Blank9> kiryu did such shit work for 6 games
[4:11:11] <thebalticguy1> YAKUZA 4'S problem wasnt daigo's fault im pretty sure
[4:11:11] <%MonsterEnvy> No it also happened under the other guys in Yakuza 0 1 and 2
[4:11:13] <%bread_assassin> That’s right. Daigo is even worse than Terada.
[4:11:14] <%murderof_crows> I thought the worst was that Omi guy Kiryu left in charge
[4:11:16] <HedgehogGames1> Daigo was a MAIN ANTAGONIST in 4!
[4:11:18] <%dave323dave> wait I just remembered wasnt Terada a secret korean traitor??
[4:11:19] <%penitentpendant> Somewhere... Kiryu is singing sad karaoke in an orphanage
[4:11:20] <KaironFortressKnight> Daigo was literally Kiryu's final boss in 4
[4:11:22] <SomeAsianDood> Kiryu kicked his shit in yakuza 2 and 4
[4:11:22] <%promessav2> this definitely turns back to "we did this for you ichiban"
[4:11:24] <+Seitine> It does make sense. He was never a 'yakuza' like the rest anyway.
[4:11:24] <+talkingrain3139> Don't hide it you cried for Daigo in Yakuza 6
[4:11:24] <+chiazam> WHY IS IT SO EASY TO DO THAT
[4:11:25] <+Wilabeen1997> He was responsible for part of 4’s plot yeah
[4:11:25] <orjin_streams> But he got into the villain's scheme really late
[4:11:27] <MasterTonberry23> Bribe the right people...
[4:11:28] <Blank9> he destroyed it and would break more of it while putting it back together with bubble gum
[4:11:35] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Done and done
[4:11:37] <+supersonic21> 4 stemmed from corupt ass police didnt it?
[4:11:38] <EBT93> Daigo’s had to deal with a ton of shit since the beginning.
[4:11:38] <%Broken_Sonex> BUT IT'S KIRYU SON THOOOO
[4:11:40] <+SilverDevilfish> Terada was PURPOSEFULLY fucking up though
[4:11:41] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Daigo might be incompetent but at least one chairman has been an active traitor
[4:11:42] <@SoFarFetched> "HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?" "YO HO HO HE TOOK A BITE OF GUM GUM"
[4:11:46] <%HitchhikingThrough> Who died to make this dude
[4:11:51] <mar_krow> don't fuck with the president/mayor son
[4:11:53] <seaechiowai> Yes but Kiryu insisted Daigo be the chairman because reasons
[4:11:55] <+tigerfang86> Yes
[4:11:57] <Pookiedaexzile> HE'S USING HIS DEAD BROTHERS NAME
[4:12:00] <+tigerfang86> oh ok, No
[4:12:02] <eco419> yup
[4:12:02] <%StebTheVee> So he's still a shut in
[4:12:04] <+tigerfang86> but in this situation Yes
[4:12:04] <%Blackleafx> @HitchhikingThrough some nobody
[4:12:06] <+chiazam> YES
[4:12:06] <huskarl_zap> Hikkiomori Aoki will return
[4:12:09] <HedgehogGames1> Didn't Daigo sell out Majima to the cops in 4?
[4:12:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Plus Aoki is currently failing at being a boxer
[4:12:11] <%LaughingCatt> for a Yakuza Prince? yeah, easy
[4:12:12] <megaman_sentinel> hot armor
[4:12:12] <hassanico2> This is an insane identity theft scheme
[4:12:16] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> We're in a video game, stupid
[4:12:19] <%st_jimmy456> maybe if you commit crimes in an organized way?
[4:12:19] <%kewlmyc> Imagine being a shut in, then someone steals your name and kill you.
[4:12:20] <+tigerfang86> you JUST brought that up Ichiban
[4:12:21] <%OfficerMods> kiryu let's fight ontop of the millennium tower until plot happens
[4:12:22] <h0wiewong> Hard to run for office if your dad's a criminal
[4:12:23] <megaman_sentinel> plot*
[4:12:25] <%Jaromero435> Ichiban is soo stupid LUL
[4:12:25] <Spagheddies> It's not easy, but if you work in the govt., it's surprisingly simple.
[4:12:25] <Meekest> Hello??? Ichiban??
[4:12:25] <%QueequegTheater> @seaechiowai Kiryu's choices were Daigo, Majima, or a pile of smoldering corpses
[4:12:28] <huskarl_zap> Just wait and see where this story goes after this.
[4:12:30] <+Pyroclase> But why male models?
[4:12:30] <orjin_streams> Because Daigo didn't have a lot of choices
[4:12:30] <CelestialCage> @HedgehogGames1 yes. He was a bad guy in Yakuza 4 but we beat him up and he learned his lesson
[4:12:32] <bobbyratlair> Daigo is unironically the worst chairman weve seen
[4:12:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> Ichiban is literally forgetting the ideas he brought up
[4:12:35] <hassanico2> They faked his death using the shut-in!
[4:12:37] <+pectusumbra> Literally this is something that was mocked back in the early chapters of Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, so like DECADES AGO
[4:12:39] <huskarl_zap> Horror Music starts
[4:12:40] <randomahole> did he notice you, Ichi?

[4:12:45] <+vaderxyz1970> Prob Japan too cuz gov still uses fax for com
[4:12:46] <+Wilabeen1997> Ichiban is barely keeping up

[4:12:47] <h0wiewong> Good point
[4:12:47] <%Blackleafx> N a n o m a c hi n e s

[4:16:40] <%mrzeeks> mrzeeks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Yakuza like a Dragons Voice over is so good that you can tell who is going to be important by just seeing who gets money thrown at the roll.
[4:16:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Living above the bar is a million times better than in the whorehouse on used mattresses.
[4:16:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope Persona 6 is about doing weed. And nothing else
[4:16:41] <+tigerfang86> WELL
[4:16:42] <hassanico2> That's why it's weird
[4:16:43] <%penitentpendant> AKA MORE SIDEQUESTS
[4:16:44] <%heartlesshealer> Why is it so much easier to love a puppy than a human child?

[4:16:59] <%medusasghost> well this was fun
[4:16:59] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt I gotta ask. For all the secret Chinese/Koreans, is the main through line of the Yakuza games that Japanese country bumpkin mafia are the most evil of all?

[4:17:43] <+NohbdyIsCrash> I love this game, but continuity is too fungible in this franchise as a whole
[4:17:49] <digitalbooklet> beautiful cant wait for more
[4:17:49] <orjin_streams> We got some good plot in
[4:17:52] <%chibicheezit> awww I wanted more yakuzies
[4:17:58] <%Zutrax> I just started a New Game+ and the very first chase sequence is the only time they use that mechanic in this entire game. Just a weird observation.

[4:19:07] <Promethezeen> Ty for help
[4:19:08] <lastnamesilverlastname> Really? Was Chapter 8 just nothing but cutscenes and a boss fight?
[4:19:12] <ateeeeez> kashiwagi was too cool to die
[4:19:12] <Promethezeen> I don’t want to spoil myself
[4:19:12] <Hoot_Patoots> he's on House of Cards

[4:25:43] <+supersonic21> shenmue
[4:25:44] <Kiaayo> note: the guy who compared it to gta was dan ryckert, who had never played a yakuza game before and totally regrets saying that now
[4:25:46] <+supersonic21> i think
[4:25:48] <+supersonic21> wait
[4:25:48] <%baka_sugoi> SAINTS ROW
[4:25:49] <+Delenay> strow?
[4:25:52] <ateeeeez> maybe saints row or something
[4:25:52] <%superc37> none
[4:25:52] <%Daxalog> Unharted?
[4:25:53] <huskarl_zap> I mean you can fuck hookers in this soo
[4:25:53] <UlriktheSlayer1> saints row?
[4:25:54] <%twistingt0rt0ise> Fallout
[4:25:54] <%bevyrage> mafia or saints row
[4:25:56] <+supersonic21> yeah saints row
[4:25:57] <+mMayrro> saints row?
[4:25:58] <%Jaller101514> nothing?
[4:25:58] <%AzureGale> Stick RPG
[4:25:59] <%Fooguwu> GTA?
[4:25:59] <NeroInfinite> Saints row probably?
[4:25:59] <%Grimlockfly> SAINTS ROW
[4:25:59] <%T_Sasquatch> Nothing
[4:25:59] <jumpyhugs> leisure suit larry
[4:25:59] <%Ynkubus_> Nothing comes close now
[4:26:00] <%BaybeeBat> saints row?
[4:26:02] <%eyezehuhh> Saints Row
[4:26:02] <huskarl_zap> also doesnt exist
[4:26:03] <%walternatorz> Saints Row totally
[4:26:03] <%kewlmyc> no
[4:26:03] <%DappercatEsquire> GTA is way too nihilistic to compare to Yakuza
[4:26:05] <%Ranryu692> there isn't one
[4:26:06] <%BaybeeBat> huh
[4:26:07] <vonmaultke> Mafia?
[4:26:07] <%Yautjabutts> What is your advice for dealing with a cat that may need surgery? I'm anxious as heck and worried about the resulting bills. Not to mention the possible risks during surgery. He's getting xray'd monday and I'm super worried about his leg.
[4:26:10] <Kisiel250> bard's tale?
[4:26:11] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> youre not wrong
[4:26:13] <UlriktheSlayer1> uh?
[4:26:13] <seaechiowai> there isn't any
[4:26:13] <+mMayrro> what?
[4:26:13] <NeroInfinite> Yeah elder scrolls
[4:26:14] <%Daxalog> Mafia or Saints Row
[4:26:15] <%eyezehuhh> Noooo
[4:26:16] <%weissguard> Saint's Row 3 and beyond, kinda.
[4:26:20] <+takutoots> hm i can see it
[4:26:20] <%eyezehuhh> Saints Row
[4:26:21] <@SSaryn> Maybe..?
[4:26:24] <huskarl_zap> Saints row but yakuza is over the top
[4:26:29] <%Ranryu692> Elder Scrolls is just fantasy GTA
[4:26:30] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah?
[4:26:32] <%promessav2> gta is like normal people are actually evil, yakuza is criminals actually good
[4:26:38] <%JeanGardner99> bit of a stretch but it works?
[4:26:47] <%Jaller101514> so not TES, just any western RPGr
[4:26:58] <huskarl_zap> criminals are good in elder scrolls too
