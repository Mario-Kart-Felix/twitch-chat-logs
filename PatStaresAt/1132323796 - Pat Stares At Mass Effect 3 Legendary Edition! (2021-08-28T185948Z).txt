[0:07:34] <tanarath> Pat devour crab to become crab
[0:07:34] <+ThomasOfTroy> All seafood except for tuna is disgusting

[0:07:36] <chainsaw105> yeah but lobsters are immortal
[0:07:36] <%LumberjackJack> They also dance in that catchy YouTube video!
[0:07:41] <anAngryHamster> I choose death
[0:07:41] <%X2Eliah> Crab is harder to eat, not enough big meat chunks
[0:07:42] <MarylandJutsu> @kikoeru_san man i haven't had one in 5ever
[0:07:43] <%Treuan> Ever seen a lobster battle? No that'd be stupid
[0:07:45] <+eanscrale> crabs are more eveolved too
[0:07:45] <MarylandJutsu> Lobsters are aliens
[0:07:45] <dekkitout> But crabs hate the shit out of everything
[0:07:47] <%toastybites> Lobsters are the Kai Leng of the sea
[0:07:47] <%RedSqurrl> I don't wanna pet anything coming out of the ocean

[0:08:13] <%X2Eliah> Crabs are super evil tho
[0:08:16] <OldManDeckardCain> so pat likes getting stabbed but hates getting shot?
[0:08:17] <%Puhff> a bite is a kind of stab
[0:08:17] <%DJFakie> Has anyone said that and meant it?? "It's cool that you can stab me!"
[0:08:18] <+cermo55> or bees
[0:08:18] <+cursedwithadhd> what about those horrible coconut crabs

[0:08:25] <Chaossheep> aren't stingers just nature's knives if you think about it
[0:08:26] <+D00msDayDan> does getting stung count as getting stabbed
[0:08:27] <Luizabd> how did you not know about animated emots?

[0:13:25] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Fair enough
[0:13:26] <+tussletoes> looking to get into mass effect but is the legendary edition actually a good way to do it or is it a shabby remaster
[0:13:38] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> i started playing far cry 5 today; gunplay is satisfying but story is fucking garbage as expected
[0:13:48] <MarylandJutsu> they fixed a lot of ME1's jank
[0:13:50] <%Puhff> yeah that was years ago
[0:13:52] <+tussletoes> cool thanks!
[0:13:55] <%FunkyStreams> re-MASS-ter.
[0:13:58] <%LumberjackJack> I'm guessing sweep the Citadel (if not finished yet), check out N7 mission(s), the Asari mission, then Rannoch>
[0:14:00] <%LumberjackJack> ?
[0:14:07] <mlbragg> Enjoying any games bes
[0:14:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS BAD
[0:14:14] <cpt_langosta> is that the american prepper cult one?
[0:14:14] <%AJ_Cherenkov> I don't think you can get a lot of me2 stuff without a lot of fucking around, unless you buy Legendary.
[0:14:18] <+rafaelba93> its boring af
[0:14:21] <%MidnightBurst12> it is so bad
[0:14:24] <+Solarint> ITS NOT POLITICAL
[0:14:24] <Abd0022> do you still play runeterra @PatStaresAt
[0:14:27] <%LumberjackJack> That sounds awful
[0:14:27] <tanarath> Haven't paid attention to far cry past 4
[0:14:28] <+tussletoes> it's amazing how little far cry 5 manages to say and do
[0:14:28] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> far cry 5 in a nutshell: doomsday preppers are right and the apocalypse is coming
[0:14:30] <%lloyddboy> UBISOFT IS NOT POLITICAL
[0:14:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The villains were interesting but the story was shit
[0:14:30] <%JamesCorck> Mass Effect time yay
[0:14:30] <%The_Death_Owl> it wasn't what was advertised at all. half assed to avoid controversy
[0:14:33] <ErikFeral> Survive Rural America - THE GAME
[0:14:36] <%Puhff> Yup
[0:14:39] <@Lion_kun> What about new dawn
[0:14:47] <%JamesCorck> Hopefully it'll be a while til we see Kai Leng the Hedgehog again.
[0:14:47] <+cursedwithadhd> the story is nonsense it's far from terrible
[0:14:48] <Abd0022> Sadge :(
[0:14:54] <+rafaelba93> oh the inclusive religious conservatives?
[0:14:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I have NMH2 installed, but I wanna replay NMH2 and play Travis Strikes Back first. Am I crazy, I'm probably crazy.
[0:14:56] <@Spydurman> ever consider trying out Magic The Gathering Arnea?
[0:14:58] <%Puhff> Also the next far Cry: new dawn or whatever just shits on the 5 story
[0:15:01] <%Treasure_Vault> Veigar coming out, get pumped
[0:15:05] <ElementCatacle> teemo cait is alright
[0:15:12] <%Retinolgaming> Ubisoft: shut up were not saying anything
[0:15:15] <cpt_langosta> ...trap cancer...?
[0:15:19] <%MisterRockett> Oh god we talking about Runeterra
[0:15:20] <%MisterRockett> ?
[0:15:29] <MarylandJutsu> Zangief does not like the poison
[0:15:31] <%JamesCorck> if Pat played Magic the Gathering he'd play Blue Magic lol
[0:15:35] <%MisterRockett> I played someone with stun bombs AND fucking poison cap mushrooms.
[0:15:35] <jimmytwofeet> Context is very important
[0:15:36] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:15:44] <%X2Eliah> James Corden's viciously gyrating crotch. Just shaking all the way on the highway
[0:15:46] <cpt_langosta> !STROKE!
[0:15:56] <%MisterRockett> Not much different yet.
[0:15:59] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I can appreciate a deck that doesn't so much try to win as punish your opponent for playing the game
[0:16:03] <ElementCatacle> Irelia and azir havent gotten nerfed
[0:16:04] <%Puhff> LET'S GET LOUD
[0:16:07] <+HefestoForges> @JamesCorck probably would go blue/black control
[0:16:09] <%miguelrod777> go hard is busted
[0:16:31] <%tinyswampthing> tinyswampthing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! im glad people are coming around to me3 after all these years. ive been saying this game was good for years and no one would say anything about it other than the ending.
[0:16:44] <%AgniBrandt> AgniBrandt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! Hey Pat! Has anyone brought Monomyth to your attention? It's a first-person dungeon crawler in development with a demo on Steam that sold me immediately.
[0:16:47] <%miguelrod777> I'm having fun with fizz and that fish girl deck
[0:16:58] <%logoth_> lol
[0:17:02] <%LumberjackJack> YEAH, IT FUCKING SUCKED
[0:17:04] <$shanna_the_banana> PAT-TUH! Did you finish 13 Sentinels? I just watched your stream of it from like a year ago and was so curious to see how you’d react to the rest of the game.
[0:17:13] <%DJFakie> Yep!
[0:17:15] <+D00msDayDan> oh right that fucking bumper
[0:17:25] <+aishman> aishman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[0:17:28] <%MisterRockett> I just finished my Rally Elusive deck today so I'm excited to have an S rank deck. Only had Pirate Agrro and Discord Aggro off that list.
[0:17:33] <%The_Death_Owl> didn't like our product? buy more products!
[0:17:37] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Not every game is stream safe yeah
[0:17:39] <%Treuan> :)
[0:17:40] <@Lion_kun> Watch Woolie's LP of 13 sentinels
[0:17:48] <jeppeww> Pat how many "Rosa Parks refusing to go to the back of the battle bus" jokes have you seen so far?
[0:17:58] <@Spydurman> 13 Sentinels only works as a stream with Emote Only mode haha. Godlike game though
[0:18:03] <%The_Death_Owl> psaDab
[0:18:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa
[0:18:13] <%Treasure_Vault> Unfortunately, he is only a human emulating goblin behavior
[0:18:15] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat says Roegadyn Supremacy. Respect. :P
[0:18:24] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Hey Pet you can actually get Tali nearly immediately. Immediately visit the Migrant Fleet and Tali joins, and it DOESN'T force you into a mission immediately like Sur Kesh. Tali can come on missions as soon as she joins.
[0:18:26] <+Aarodar> I bought Disco Elysium and don’t play crpgs is it worth it to play with or without a guide
[0:18:29] <%Garthunox> Pat im playing Yakuza 3 again for the platinum, just started and oh god, going from K2 to 3 is ROUGH
[0:18:37] <Blackleafx> CRAB
[0:18:38] <cpt_langosta> large crab
[0:18:56] <%Ynkubus_> (V).i,,,i.(V)
[0:18:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @aarodar 100% worth it without a guide for the first time through
[0:19:03] <commanderapathy> @patstaresat I did not know how cringe kai leng was until you pointed it out in the podcast
[0:19:04] <%jillyrancher> kk
[0:19:09] <%LeiaSkynoober> @Aarodar Go by your heart
[0:19:10] <@Lion_kun> Star Trek is leaving Netflix
[0:19:20] <anAngryHamster> Crab Nicholson Extreme  Sleepover Text Adventure
[0:19:20] <+Aarodar> Hell yeah I will do that! Thanks!
[0:19:22] <%logoth_> thats not real
[0:19:23] <%Garthunox> OH NO
[0:19:23] <Tracazoid> Good times
[0:19:25] <%Dakuu75> no... question mark
[0:19:26] <%Straffa> Straffa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! ty for the perfect background noise
[0:19:27] <+BigNerdSam> RYKER TOO POWERFUL
[0:19:27] <%FunkyStreams> nice
[0:19:29] <%Garthunox> i better watch Voyager soon
[0:19:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> @logoth_ ITS SUPER REAL
[0:19:33] <dekkitout> Ricker's a sigma?
[0:19:37] <%Bailey__gaming> Who has to clean the holodeck of all the countles fluids?
[0:19:37] <%MidnightBurst12> SIGMA MALE MOVE
[0:19:39] <%Puhff> @Aarodan I would argue using a guide actually makes the Disco experience worse. You can save scum but the game is designed to flow around failure.
[0:19:42] <%akscully> it was famke, right?
[0:19:47] <UncleOliver> star trek is leaving netflix?
[0:19:48] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Kai "Boruto" Leng will return in "Blasto 7"
[0:19:52] <@Lion_kun> It sucks, I'm watching TNG right now and wanted to finish the franchise on Netflix
[0:20:04] <%logoth_> Just look at game of thrones!
[0:20:06] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, ME3 really fucked up on release time
[0:20:09] <%LumberjackJack> ME3 has always been great, but that fucking ending killed that pure, fanboy love I used to have
[0:20:21] <%jillyrancher> I'll have to go back to work soon so I dont respond Pat sorry
[0:20:23] <+cermo55> @TallGuyWithAHoodie Kia Leng would be a perfect Blasto villan
[0:20:24] <%unhuggable1> it is much more fleshed out with all the DLC
[0:20:26] <%X2Eliah> Also hey playing ME3 on release without Javik was not nice
[0:20:44] <Zeif00> All that EA meddling
[0:20:45] <OldManDeckardCain> nah, me3 is still a bad game. the ending is just a cherry on top. it might be better now but meh
[0:20:52] <%Retinolgaming> but I will revisit mass effect games, game of thrones I have no desire to ever go back and rewatch
[0:21:00] <$Jetfandam> I still think Mass Effect 3 is the weakest of the trilogy. It's not bad but it's not as good as 1 or 2
[0:21:01] <tattleworm> you know what wasn't linear? andromeda
[0:21:02] <chainsaw105> 3: Kai Leng
[0:21:04] <%ahomeschooldropout> Only Voyager, Original Star Trek, and Enterprise are leaving Netflix. DS9 and TNG are staying
[0:21:06] <%LumberjackJack> 1. Central plot comes out of nowhere, 2. Rushed spots stick out like a sore thumb, 3. Ending
[0:21:12] <%Pappajimbo> Battle star galactica
[0:21:15] <%X2Eliah> not that often, youll be fine
[0:21:15] <%Tyrant_seabear> PJSalt800 I've finally escaped retail hell into a much better job, it was always great to hear about others on this channel doing the same, hope this inspires someone else to keep at it
[0:21:15] <GameOver_Here> You can still play ME3 multiplayer if you play the 360 version on backwards compatibility.
[0:21:15] <OldManDeckardCain> you better be ready LUL
[0:21:17] <%logoth_> I WAS
[0:21:19] <Latija> strap yourself in
[0:21:22] <cpt_langosta> he shows up too many times
[0:21:23] <jimmytwofeet> 3 - Javik as DLC
[0:21:26] <Aiutare47> They were
[0:21:26] <%Puhff> He's my favorite
[0:21:26] <Radioactive_Jam > I forgot all about him
[0:21:29] <IvanMistwalker> HE SUCKS
[0:21:30] <Tracazoid> He's a character from another franchise
[0:21:31] <Dova573> I tottaly forgot aboyt Kia leng
[0:21:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He’s the funniest
[0:21:37] <dekkitout> Obtusely bad
[0:21:38] <available_line> Becasue he's funny-lame. He's like he came straight of of Revengence.
[0:21:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He sucks so much its funny
[0:21:41] <$shanna_the_banana> Lol so not surprised only TNG and DS9 made the cut
[0:21:41] <PaperyHornet1013> He’s great
[0:21:44] <%Puhff> Kai Leng the Hedgehog
[0:21:45] <%lloyddboy> in the book he pisses in a plant
[0:21:48] <%Pappajimbo> Nothing personal
[0:21:48] <Laecerelius> Inquisitor Martyr is fine
[0:21:55] <commanderapathy> that excript you read from the comics was too much for me
[0:21:55] <Blank9> kai leng sucks, he rules
[0:21:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @lloyddboy shut up oh my god
[0:22:10] <DatAsuna> Kai Leng out here looking like black widow in the avengers game
[0:22:10] <cpt_langosta> *squeak*
[0:22:11] <Latija> I just want darktide ;-;
[0:22:11] <jeppeww> I would bet money that Kai Leng was someones shadowrun character in college
[0:22:15] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Kai Leng isn't mad that you beat him, and he'll go bang his harem of Cerberus phantoms to prove he isn't mad
[0:22:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I swear to god they make him so edgy
[0:22:20] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> The ending could have been a picture of a dick for all I care if Kay Leng wasnt in the game
[0:22:25] <PaperyHornet1013> Kai leng is a better character than mordin
[0:22:30] <%jillyrancher> Aww
[0:22:42] <UncleOliver> ds9 and TNG were my favorites so I'm kinda okay with it i guess, never made it more than like 2 or 3 episodes into enterprise
[0:22:45] <%faintsmile> @PaperyHornet1013 why you lying
[0:22:45] <%TheHateFish> @jeppeww I'd match that bet, and add that he was probably an Elf in Shadowrun
[0:22:46] <%jillyrancher> oh dear
[0:22:49] <%LumberjackJack> @PaperyHornet1013 That's bait
[0:22:53] <%jillyrancher> fair enough
[0:22:55] <commanderapathy> @paperyhornet1013 nice bait
[0:23:02] <%X2Eliah> Whoever made Kasumi's loyalty mission in ME2 probably had a big part in Kail Leng's design. Both do cringy naruto-esque ninja stuff
[0:23:04] <+Shoosler> 40k Mechanicus is really good. darkest dungeon-ish XCOM type of game
[0:23:08] <PaperyHornet1013> What?
[0:23:21] <MarylandJutsu> @X2Eliah but kasumi is actually a fun charecter
[0:23:23] <UncleOliver> hot take, voyager is a bit shite but fun
[0:23:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @perfectpepperplantpro but why would you want the ending to be a picture of Kai leng Kappa
[0:23:26] <%AgniBrandt> It's inspired by Arx Fatalis! Someone on the discord recommended it
[0:23:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Dark Messiah of Might and Magic looking videogame
[0:23:30] <%jillyrancher> I think Battlesector is good
[0:23:35] <Laecerelius> SNES version?
[0:23:42] <anAngryHamster> It's got an immersive sim tag
[0:23:43] <fetelgeuse> I rented that game as a kid and forgot all about it till now!
[0:23:44] <%faintsmile> @X2Eliah oh wow ur right. i forgot abt the ridiculous ninja moves kasumi does
[0:23:44] <DatAsuna> man arc fatlis was a while ago
[0:23:49] <%X2Eliah> @MarylandJutsu Oh yeah, for sure. I'm referring to the cutscene design, and that helicopter flipping
[0:23:52] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Have You tried plying EOTB with All Seeing Eye?
[0:23:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oof
[0:23:56] <%Treasure_Vault> Hot take: I'd rather watch Enterprise than TNG
[0:23:58] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> @SuckerPunchSyd Good point lol
[0:24:04] <MarylandJutsu> @X2Eliah ahhh got ya
[0:24:21] <+Shoosler> @jillyrancher yeah  battlesector is pretty good. rough around the edges but it's the best video game version of the tabletop game I've played
[0:24:30] <DatAsuna> never forget that JACOB of all people got a spinoff game
[0:24:45] <+Ropcord> i completely forgot lmao
[0:24:50] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @DatAsuna which game?
[0:24:52] <%X2Eliah> @DatAsuna Hey now. Jacob hustles. Jacob *fucks*
[0:25:09] <%Treasure_Vault> Hanhar

[0:25:23] <Blank9> elcor
[0:25:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> Elcor
[0:25:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> same
[0:25:25] <%Theycallmenerf> Hey Pat have you played that Quake anniversary game?
[0:25:27] <%Treuan> Smellyfish
[0:25:31] <%lloyddboy> keeper, he does whatever the fuck he wants and no one can stop him
[0:25:31] <%X2Eliah> hanar fits his personality
[0:25:33] <%jillyrancher> A Varren?
[0:25:33] <%Theycallmenerf> I’d say Elcor
[0:25:34] <overlordloki> yes
[0:25:40] <%Treasure_Vault> Elmo and Blasto, best buds
[0:25:40] <cpt_langosta> "This one requests the Orb Goblin to give headpats."
[0:25:42] <MarylandJutsu> Hanar is strong with elmo.....this one is the star of the stream
[0:25:44] <%jillyrancher> A Nathak
[0:25:49] <%akscully> hanar are formal and cats are also formal victorian children
[0:25:53] <+Ropcord> gief is elcor

[0:26:06] <%DJFakie> Blood's really good from the Build engine era
[0:26:09] <@Moobot> @trackles_64 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 24s.
[0:26:15] <%Theycallmenerf> I haven’t played Dusk yet but playing Quake for the first time ever was really fun.
[0:26:17] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @DatAsuna Okay, I only remembered infiltrator, which definitely wasn't jacob
[0:26:21] <chainsaw105> Pat help my friend is about to start playing the Yakuza series using keyboard controls, what do
[0:26:28] <+cermo55> Kia Leng would have gone up a few points if they said that Cerberus brought him back to life solely because they lost shepard.
[0:26:29] <+rafaelba93> DUSK is so good
[0:26:32] <Blackleafx> massy time
[0:26:34] <%jillyrancher> Still waiting for that Dusk Switch port lol
[0:26:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL
[0:26:42] <chainsaw105> he refuses to use a controller
[0:26:49] <%FunkyStreams> cant wait for gloomwood
[0:26:50] <%LumberjackJack> Can't wait for that one mission with that one new enemy that may or may not still give me chills to this day
[0:26:56] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Before I forget Pat you can actually get Tali nearly immediately. Immediately visit the Migrant Fleet and Tali joins, and it DOESN'T force you into a mission immediately like Sur Kesh. Tali can come on missions as soon as she joins.
[0:26:56] <%The_Death_Owl> Real Yakuza use a controller
[0:26:57] <+KaguraRaion> @chainsaw105 Take his hands
[0:26:59] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Time to save the galaxy from the Batarians- I mean, Reapers!
[0:27:02] <%Garthunox> Real Yakuza use a gamepad
[0:27:02] <Latija> real Yakuza use a gamepad
[0:27:04] <+Shoosler> then he's not a real YAKUZA
[0:27:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> beat him over the head with a controller
[0:27:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @chainsaw105 steal his keyboard its the only way
[0:27:11] <%shadowsofpain> Tell him real yakuza use gamepad
[0:27:19] <+MTLxSpider> LMAO
[0:27:23] <+MTLxSpider> 5Head
[0:27:24] <Profmcstevie> Screenshot it and send it to Sega
[0:27:29] <%RedSqurrl> I love it lmao
[0:27:31] <commanderapathy> that's petty but also genius
[0:27:31] <+bear_breaker20> sounds vindictive
[0:27:33] <%Puhff> BINGO
[0:27:35] <%X2Eliah> Pat you are being super toxic
[0:27:37] <Blank9> send him a picture of the startup of the game
[0:27:40] <bob900000> play no more heroes with the joycons detached
[0:27:40] <dekkitout> Let him suffer. Study his behavior as he plays the game. We'll make a research subject of him.
[0:27:44] <chainsaw105> he said if the devs didn't want people to use keyboard and mouse then they "should have stayed in their lane and stayed on console only"
[0:27:45] <+Ropcord> LUL
[0:27:45] <$hattrick61> s
[0:27:46] <Tracazoid> Be sure to have a faded image of Real Yakuza Use a Gamepad behind the image of his refusal to use a controller for the shits and giggles
[0:27:50] <+Shoosler> toxic genius
[0:28:00] <%Puhff> Oh no, the consequences of my own actions!
[0:28:04] <+GuilKato> all games should support keyboard properly
[0:28:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Holy shit I’m gonna tackle your friend
[0:28:11] <%FunkyStreams> she's been psychoanalyzed.
[0:28:12] <+KaguraRaion> @chainsaw105 That is the dumbest shit i have ever heard lol
[0:28:12] <commanderapathy> my dog used to do that
[0:28:15] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @chainsaw105 your friend sounds like an asshole, holy crap
[0:28:15] <%TheHateFish> Oh fuck, that's the most toxic platform superiority I've seen in a long-ass time, Chainsaw

[0:30:43] <chainsaw105> @chainsaw105 I gave him character action games as another example and he said "I bet they feel better with a keyboard"
