[0:09:13] <%CitrusDrink> @AngriestPat hey Pat, I recently got all my crafters and gatherers to 70, and I remember you keep a stack of crafters souls on you, would you say it's worth changing specialty often if I don't plan on making super high level stuff? or are my scrips better spent on other stuff?
[0:09:16] <Delenay> dont care for that
[0:09:17] <%Ner234> Time Travel NotLikeThis

[0:09:57] <ashkering> hey PAT can you convince be to buy shadowbringers?
[0:09:59] <sjcodan> @bbomi1995 Its the FF main theme, from all games
[0:10:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> lyse shouldn't die. she sucks, but making her an iconic character by killing her is uncalled for.
[0:10:23] <TheEvilOmega> @AngriestPat Any chance you can explain how Glamour and Glamour plates work?

[0:11:30] <sjcodan> COMPLETE ASS
[0:11:30] <CountMeowingtonn> @AngriestPat Yoshi-P said this will cover 80% of the Hydalean and Zordiark story, where do you think they should go after it concludes?
[0:11:38] <Aetropos> what about the thresholds of 50-51 or 60-61?
[0:11:39] <Thorn14> DansGame

[0:11:48] <graemecrackers1> big boy burps
[0:11:49] <XyraFhoan> specialist macros are nutty though, you can make some pretty short ones (comparatively) for 100% reliable results for the very endgame crafts
[0:11:53] <%CitrusDrink> I'm just glad I never have to talk to those GOD DAMN MOOGLES again
[0:11:53] <ashkering> @AkimboSavior71 i cant*
[0:12:01] <gypsystranger> hey pat where do you get glam prisms, are they only craftable?
[0:12:02] <+EriksBlue> the stuff I dont enjoy is those dumb Fisher quests

[0:12:15] <ReiDuran> IVALICE
[0:12:15] <+darienmask> Judge armor would be amazing
[0:12:16] <$valriot> Judge armour sucks
[0:12:17] <%maskedriderhero> Give me my JUDGE ARMOR

[0:12:19] <%CitrusDrink> You can get them with grand company token things too
[0:12:19] <Thorn14> @AngriestPat Thoughts on only Level 80 Job Quests, and being replaced by Role Quests?

[0:12:40] <%spiritofmojave> Judge armor is HOT
[0:12:40] <sjcodan> I want the raid gear from Yorha raid is the heavy armor
[0:12:41] <+Shinmaddrox> Isn't there going to more advanced classes?
[0:12:43] <Calamity2007> Fuck the Garleans up
[0:12:52] <%Taisuru> @clempstwitch CLEEEEMPS
[0:12:54] <unlimited_osteopath> That's gonna suck. The DRK questline is really good.
[0:12:57] <%MyDarkStorm> I still want yotsuyu Dress for my character
[0:12:58] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> @clempstwitch jaketh24Goku
[0:12:58] <%Nikopol1717> @AngriestPat Have far did you get in Eureka? Trying to get that sweet Elemental Fending set before Shadowbringers
[0:12:59] <%blastazoid26> I hope ipthe video is fucked up this time
[0:13:04] <%cvp5127> how long are these usually?
[0:13:07] <%clempstwitch> GAMERS
[0:13:08] <%AkimboSavior71> @ashkering You don't have to, it's just an option
[0:13:08] <+SubtleAddict> remember when we did that boss and to destroy him we just yeeted shit off a bridge
[0:13:09] <+Karasseram> They say the 80 job quest is as long as all the ones that you'd ahve gotten on the way
[0:13:12] <TheNocturnalScotsman> what i'd give for a Judge class with sick judge armour
[0:13:13] <%kiiiirsten> sbfpPatschwitz
[0:13:14] <Calamity2007> @sjcodan I unironically want the heavy armor from that raid to just be the armor of the grunt robots
[0:13:20] <+Karasseram> just its one long one
[0:13:23] <sjcodan> @Calamity2007 yeyeye
[0:13:36] <quigley_plays> You need to do one set, ther'es one for each job type, right?
[0:13:42] <Thorn14> I hope the quests are good and not just "Hey wow that was some adventure, here's your skill and armor, bye!"
[0:13:46] <sovayell> THICC QUEST
[0:13:47] <Aetropos> I just hope we still get our class lore
[0:13:49] <%Arnschen> Yeah, if the 80 jobs quests are as long as the questlines we've done like they've said, it'll be alot better
[0:13:50] <+Karasseram> pretty sure it'll give you your 80 skill cause living shadow is very lore heavy
[0:13:58] <TheViltsuZ> How long until live letter?
[0:14:05] <Calamity2007> So are there no new skills from 71-80 until the 80 job quest @AngriestPat
[0:14:06] <bestwaifuritsu> 20 minutes ish
[0:14:06] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat what is the over/under on sound problems again
[0:14:17] <unlimited_osteopath> I do like it when they integrate skills into the quest, like with The Blackest Night at level 70.
[0:14:24] <RamenRiderZ> Pat what if the tank quests are about Curious Gorge Kappa
[0:14:33] <+Sir_gonthorian> what role do you main ??
[0:14:35] <%Kazooki_Kazami> i'm having a really difficult time leveling the crafters to 50 because of inventory management. What do you recommend on the process of levelling them? @AngriestPat
[0:14:38] <IndoorSitup> Pat are you still mad about being wrong bout Banjo Kazooie?
[0:14:38] <%Chichen> chicheDex
[0:14:39] <%kiiiirsten> sbfpPatschwitz me watching this and burning for WoW Classic because I'm trash
[0:14:46] <%spiritofmojave> think we'll get more quests where we randomly switch to one of the Scions/Yugiri?
[0:14:49] <%Shadowthedigger> FUCK YOU PAT
[0:14:50] <Dwarven_Gaming> curious george?
[0:14:52] <%Shadowthedigger> He's great
[0:14:55] <Calamity2007> Curious Gorge is a jobber
[0:14:55] <%kiiiirsten> like the monkey?
[0:14:58] <bestwaifuritsu> george is a bumbling fucking asshole
[0:14:58] <Aetropos> streamer is wrong
[0:15:03] <Dwarven_Gaming> drk is the best
[0:15:05] <sjcodan> PLD is good
[0:15:05] <%MyDarkStorm> WAR Trainer
[0:15:07] <%nmaten> Dragoon tho
[0:15:10] <%Arnschen> Gorge is...alright
[0:15:10] <%Taisuru> Curious Gorge is the best you take that back
[0:15:12] <$valriot> Bard quest sucks
[0:15:12] <%Kazooki_Kazami> tbf, the game knows he's a loser
[0:15:13] <+UberWolfman> FUCK YOU RIGHT PAT
[0:15:14] <unlimited_osteopath> Yeah but Pat, warrior is all about being stupid and all that stupid bullshit, so it's pretty on point with the overarching theme of stupidity.
[0:15:15] <%HajimenoStream> I love gorge he fucking sucks
[0:15:16] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> @angriestpat think we'll get any info about the nier raid?
[0:15:20] <%laazybulbasaur> Hey @angriestpat i'm new too the MMO genre and really wanted to start with ff14 any advice/tips?
[0:15:21] <sovayell> Hey Pat, does the Warrior story quest get better in stormblood? doing the ones in ARR and HW arent that great.
[0:15:23] <Calamity2007> I love dumbass adventures!
[0:15:25] <ReiDuran> The PLD quests are pretty cool. I like how the StB quests involved the original GLD questgiver.
[0:15:26] <%OdysseyKnight> Blm gets a pretty alright dumbass adventure

[0:15:37] <%JustAnotherMuffin> DRA had story quest since you hang with Estienien
[0:15:39] <%spiritofmojave> DRK's centricity to the story and DRG are tight
[0:15:39] <%NovraSplice> I've actually been pleasantly surprised with FFXIV, brand new player after flip flopping between MMOs for years and your streams have helped a huge amount Pat, so thank you!
[0:15:40] <%Arnschen> That's literally the questline
[0:15:42] <%AquilaHarukaze> IIRC PLD just kinda goes off and does something else.
[0:15:44] <%cTAKU> Love it\
[0:15:45] <$valriot> YEAH ITS GREAT
[0:15:47] <%FrostMass22> @angriestpat Is being a healer fun?
[0:15:51] <fkellington> @angriestpat Do you think it's better to level up a class to max before starting on another or is it fine to level a couple of classes at once?
[0:15:53] <%HajimenoStream> thebesssssst
[0:15:53] <cizal11> that's true

[0:19:50] <+TheImmortal70> That's not even the plan
[0:19:52] <zamzoph> ?????
[0:19:52] <+Grayhammatter> pretty much
[0:19:53] <Foggysheep> he must win!
[0:19:53] <Stay_Knight> The Gladiator questline is super good
[0:19:54] <%Ner234> ???
[0:19:54] <%spiritofmojave> Healers adjust to soul
[0:19:56] <srkAres> LUL
[0:19:56] <CyrusBain> @AngriestPat Talk about the most sleeper DRK 61 through 70 that is boring until the ass end.
[0:19:58] <CountMeowingtonn> I love the SAM Quest where you hunt down and murder an actual weeb
[0:19:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> @urielcobalt lalafels
[0:19:58] <%Jacobblast> @angriestpat should i work towards a white mage or a bard?
[0:20:00] <unlimited_osteopath> Pat, talk about the SAM questline and how there are cowboy samurais in it.
[0:20:01] <haveswordmuststing> @sovayell and evil, dont forget evil
[0:20:03] <mikash81> shoulda stuck to the plan
[0:20:04] <Gork_N_Mork> Does Pat hate lalafells
[0:20:04] <ColRedyx> Sounds like a BLM to me.
[0:20:04] <%Arnschen> It's true
[0:20:05] <Onmi_Khaos> Gladiator Questline is good which is weird that Paladin questline isn't
[0:20:06] <Ziginski> 100% accurate
[0:20:09] <+TheImmortal70> The plan is to let the demon get it's main body back so they can BLAST IT so they don't kill their brother
[0:20:11] <%CitrusDrink> It's perfect because the demon would never suspect
[0:20:14] <sovayell> @haveswordmuststing SO evil
[0:20:14] <$valriot> And then they do BIG DICK DPS
[0:20:15] <+TheImmortal70> And THEN they piss themselves
[0:20:15] <Calamity2007> This is why I light roleplay as a Potato who hates dealing with cult shit and just wants to be a cool tank
[0:20:15] <%luckeymancan> luckeymancan subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:20:15] <TheHoodKnight> Warrior storyline is pretty good
[0:20:16] <pimpinahz> well I say Toy Story... Potato Man is always the bad guy
[0:20:18] <+TONYOO101> has pat played the monk questline yet?
[0:20:18] <cizal11> @AngriestPat thing to keep in mind is all the arr class and job questlines up to 50 are technically just the 1.0 quests updated for arr. so their quality kinda varies wildly. pugilists was still amazing though
[0:20:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> lalafels are the worst.
[0:20:19] <+UberWolfman> Pat SUPER HATES Lalafells
[0:20:20] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL and the weeb in question turns out to be a Lala
[0:20:27] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat the fuck is this potato plot writing masterpiece u speak of?
[0:20:27] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[0:20:32] <%Finaldragoon> Summoner Stormblood is all about dealing with Allagan tech that could wipe out everything
[0:20:36] <+einterblathnir> i unironically really love the smn storyline
[0:20:38] <%kiiiirsten> Pat make your window bigger so we can see your feet sushiToeHeart

[0:20:39] <%nmaten> mah wife
[0:20:40] <jonathandemel> Awww
[0:20:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Raubahn wants to bang a potato.
[0:20:45] <Calamity2007> Lalafels are the worst and I am so glad I main one LUL
[0:20:48] <%Ner234> What are your favorite job quests Pat?
[0:20:49] <%snow_bush> Oh hai waife
[0:20:56] <%Ner234> PogChamp
[0:20:56] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat Any thoughts on how badly SCH will be castrated in Stormbringers?
[0:21:01] <haveswordmuststing> @einterblathnir isnt that the only one involving Ascians
[0:21:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> does paige have rhythm?
[0:21:04] <+MechaBaphomet> where is the gamer cube?
[0:21:04] <rosemon5001> cadance looks soo smooth
[0:21:06] <AndySoryu> cadence is really goddamn fun
[0:21:14] <unlimited_osteopath> 2.1 best story patch kappa
[0:21:21] <%Dr00_PhD> It's Really good guys go buy it
[0:21:23] <cizal11> it's usually pretty good though
[0:21:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hi pat
[0:21:28] <Stay_Knight> In general it's really good.
[0:21:29] <pimpinahz> I see part of Pat's foot.. ugh man gawd
[0:21:31] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat The marader warrior class quest is great.
[0:21:33] <sjcodan> Is bad
[0:21:34] <%nmaten> true
[0:21:34] <haveswordmuststing> yep
[0:21:35] <+darienmask> The banquet :/
[0:21:36] <@commanderclaw> FUCK THE SYLPHS
[0:21:36] <%Chichen> yep
[0:21:37] <sovayell> 2.X = really poor. 3.0 = easily one of the best FF story
[0:21:37] <+alphonseisbest> TITAN SUCKSSS
[0:21:39] <%Arnschen> OH MAN, TITAN
[0:21:41] <%Docblargle> arr post game made me wanna kms
[0:21:43] <cizal11> but titan himself is really cool
[0:21:43] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> race war happening now its good
[0:21:44] <+SubtleAddict> titan questline is 10 levels of fucking fetch quests
[0:21:45] <RamenRiderZ> screw the titan arc
[0:21:49] <sjcodan> FILLLLLLERRRR
[0:21:54] <%Arnschen> The 100 quests
[0:21:56] <%spiritofmojave> depends I think how well you can tolerate the slow start up 15-25
[0:21:58] <%bluetocho13> if the story can make me cry then its good
[0:21:59] <haveswordmuststing> 100 quests man
[0:21:59] <+TheImmortal70> The 1005 trials
[0:22:01] <weeters> literally 100 filler quests
[0:22:03] <%Jarvanii> don't you have to fight titan three times in msq?
[0:22:04] <SweetCuppingCake> God, even running titan now is a huge pain. Constantly have four people or more get knocked off
[0:22:05] <elisascarlet> 2.0 = eh 2.x = piss 3.0 = Feels like an actual Final Fantasy
[0:22:08] <+azure22900> Just pay the $5 to skip
[0:22:10] <+FennecZephyr> That's why I quit the game the first time
[0:22:11] <%CitrusDrink> Pre-heavensward heavensward quests go on FOREVER
[0:22:13] <MaeMae94> @AngriestPat I just did seventh astral era, IT'S SO BAD
[0:22:14] <%nmaten> hey go over here and touch this x50
[0:22:14] <haveswordmuststing> 100 quests and dumping all of the hard dungeon unlocks
[0:22:15] <%GingaNZ> filler arc
[0:22:18] <%spiritofmojave> Expansion limbo arc
[0:22:19] <LordFalara> theres alot of good stuff in those 100 quests but their like 60 quests too long
[0:22:27] <%Top35> I'm in that grind now
[0:22:29] <SwinefaceGamecock> oof
[0:22:31] <AndySoryu> 3.3 is the peak, yeah
[0:22:35] <Onmi_Khaos> Stuff HAPPENS in 2.x but it's just too long
[0:22:35] <%chrishnaw> !uptime
[0:22:35] <unlimited_osteopath> hold up, did they retroactively level-gate the ARR patch MSQ quests?? lol
[0:22:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 22m 37s.
[0:22:39] <%QuadraticGravity> Between 60 and 61 is amazing.
[0:22:40] <elisascarlet> @AngriestPat What do you think about gatekeeper bosses like Omega M&F and Clown Kefka not being a thing in Eden?
[0:22:40] <Stay_Knight> Cool villain in Stormblood
[0:22:43] <$Garthunox> pat I'm 54 and still on filler! you lie!
[0:22:45] <TheViltsuZ> Hey Pat, what are your top 3 favorite game series?
[0:22:47] <+Grayhammatter> oh snap, we in for a good ride
[0:22:52] <%Chichen> Accurate
[0:22:58] <Nina96> so its all bad or mediocre till near the end?
[0:22:58] <%nmaten> Heavensward and post Heavensward are godlike
[0:22:59] <cizal11> @unlimited_osteopath retroactively? no, he just means the levels around where you'd normally get to them
[0:22:59] <SweetCuppingCake> that race war
[0:23:02] <%kujofire990> I'm in Naruto Filler land now
[0:23:03] <%clempstwitch> Its like rating a TV show by seasons, honestly.
[0:23:03] <%JustAnotherMuffin> Havensward is so strong. Dragonsong ward is really hype
[0:23:07] <%caffeinomancer> caffeinomancer subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:23:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@crazyspartan214) (warning)
[0:23:08] <ReiDuran> Zenos is FUCKIN NUTS
[0:23:08] <MaeMae94> @Garthunox I finished at 55 so have fun with that last level
[0:23:10] <%yeknomlive> is it too early to see nier raid stuff
[0:23:10] <$Garthunox> ah
[0:23:11] <%scrumdrew> patch 3.3 was the shit
[0:23:11] <Covil91> Step on me Yotsuyu!
[0:23:13] <bestwaifuritsu> I hated Hien and didnt care in the slightest about his boring kingdom LUL
[0:23:16] <%Chichen> Its like rating JoJo parts
[0:23:19] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:23:20] <$Garthunox> I'm the crazy talk
[0:23:23] <%CaptainKarite> I was 57 by the end of filler with my sam at 54, my red mage at 52, and my ninja at 52
[0:23:25] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat You have any thoughts on all the upcoming SCH changes?
[0:23:27] <%Venhammer> when does it start?
[0:23:30] <bestwaifuritsu> Ruby Sea is a great zone, Yanxia SUCKS
[0:23:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> ARR is the Casual Filter
[0:23:32] <%Docblargle> Zenos best antagonist. Id say Gaius but hes not really a villain if I agree with him
[0:23:32] <sovayell> better to refer to patch numbers rather than levels when talking about quality
[0:23:34] <haveswordmuststing> not to mention the 100 quest trial gives no XP
[0:23:35] <RosELLo6> bruh i was 70 before i started SB because im a crazy person
[0:23:37] <ReiDuran> Everything around Yotsuyu is WOOF.
[0:23:38] <%bluetocho13> the end of the 100 quest filler is worth it tho
[0:23:39] <Onmi_Khaos> The worst part is your skills don't get upgraded and you can't do job quests till you get to HW
[0:23:40] <cizal11> @AngriestPat the difference there is you got all that stuff piecemeal, and it was WAY more tolerable doing it as it came out.
[0:23:40] <+smevvster> They actually went back and increased the amount of EXP that the post ARR patch cycle content gives.
[0:23:45] <Onmi_Khaos> So it's 100 quests of unchanging growth
[0:23:46] <haveswordmuststing> or atleast like 48,000
[0:23:49] <@SSaryn> I should mention that if you wanna go see what the story of 1.X is, go look at EthysAshers video on YouTube as well.
[0:23:55] <%TombstoneTTromboners> people are divided on sch
[0:23:57] <Calamity2007> @ReiDuran At least the raid is fun
[0:24:03] <haveswordmuststing> or 480,000*
[0:24:04] <$Garthunox> Oh pat, I'm about to Leviathan sometime soon, any tips? I'm a warrior
[0:24:08] <EL_TRO> Man I hope they make Cloud extra nuts in FF7RE
[0:24:08] <Calamity2007> @ReiDuran I mean trial
[0:24:10] <$SleepyMaribo> yep
[0:24:13] <$valriot> YES IT WAS
[0:24:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 'we have all'
[0:24:17] <unlimited_osteopath> @AngriestPat ain't it kinda fucked up how we just abandon the whole situation with Garlemald to fuck off to a different shard and solve their light issue?
[0:24:20] <+alphonseisbest> @onmi_khaos but the last 25 quests are story import
[0:24:23] <%TombstoneTTromboners> because people don't like sch not being busted anymore
[0:24:24] <%shadowace2400> god dam internet dying on me
[0:24:27] <+metalsiren31> No it didn't :(
[0:24:28] <%spiritofmojave> Literally made for "off-healing" like OT back then
[0:24:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> Wow
[0:24:30] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it was ridiculous
[0:24:31] <%DavidSanChan> I'm just enjoying being a big girl with a big axe collecting oranges
[0:24:32] <lonerurouni187> and they still will lol
[0:24:33] <%nmaten> true, but it sucks for scholar players
[0:24:33] <%castcode> PogChamp
[0:24:36] <Fuji_Apples> so they're badass bookmen
[0:24:36] <Stay_Knight> I worry about queue times
[0:24:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Scholar Chads
[0:24:38] <%Kazooki_Kazami> ok well they feel AWFUL NOW
[0:24:38] <Triforce_of_nerd> hey guys o/
[0:24:44] <+metalsiren31> Just buff the other healers :V
[0:24:52] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat so why do tanks get to be dps and not a "tank"
[0:24:54] <%spiritofmojave> I miss my SCH chad even if it was busted jermaPluto
[0:24:56] <ReiDuran> Yeah I can't believe they made me CARE about her. The whole thing with Tsukuyomi was ;_;
[0:24:58] <elisascarlet> there is an entire meta revolving around generating a ton of LB because of mitigation, especially SCH
[0:24:59] <SweetCuppingCake> I'm super sad about my AST changes
[0:25:01] <Thalchampz> true
[0:25:05] <%QuadraticGravity> We dump stacks on Indom, Soil, and Bane, we don't need energy drain
[0:25:07] <sovayell> but MONSTA CARDO
[0:25:07] <$valriot> @angriestpat You can use Excog on the Fairy to gain fairy gauge now
[0:25:11] <%CitrusDrink> I'm gonna miss all the fancy cards
[0:25:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @davidsanchan something we should all endeavor toward.
[0:25:18] <ShutUpAceyP> i'm upset about SCH because it doesn't seem as complicated. I liked having so much stuff to manage. It's why I like BRD!
[0:25:19] <%alcors_wisdom> sup pat imma just use the sultry tones of your voice to take a quick nap before a cook super thans
[0:25:21] <@Pandora_Prime> Now everything is Balance
[0:25:22] <+MechaBaphomet> any tips on what to focus on when you start the game? @AngriestPat
[0:25:23] <CountMeowingtonn> 4 out of the 6 Astro cards were worthless
[0:25:25] <Covil91> Bane is gone too
[0:25:25] <+Zxtole> I like fishing for balance because it's like playing a combo deck in mtg
[0:25:26] <Calamity2007> I feel that they are taking the buff from SCH and AST and focusing it on Dancer
[0:25:28] <bestwaifuritsu> Boy I sure love fishing for fucking spires
[0:25:30] <Morsuzado> yep
[0:25:33] <%Yadogari> TRIPLE S
[0:25:34] <iheartmota> FUCKING SPIRES
[0:25:34] <ColRedyx> There are actually people on Reddit defending the existence of useless cards.
[0:25:34] <%spiritofmojave> Oops all spire
[0:25:35] <Ultimatefool> Ewer -> Ewer .... -> Ewer
[0:25:36] <+killer_squid1990> SPIRE LUL
[0:25:37] <%radda343> I main AST and am excited for the changes, I hated balance fishing
[0:25:38] <+Brighthawk> Yay it's Pat king of Eorzea!
[0:25:40] <%nmaten> oops all spires
[0:25:42] <+timbob> Soooo should i get this game?
[0:25:43] <haveswordmuststing> @Calamity2007 probably the plan
[0:25:43] <%blastazoid26> LUL
[0:25:45] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[0:25:46] <Calamity2007> That is why AST draw should be on a rotation
[0:25:46] <%Kazooki_Kazami> yeah im gonna spread ewer for my whole party
[0:25:49] <%Typhaeon> Ey I didn't miss it
[0:25:49] <Thalchampz> oops all spires LUL
[0:25:50] <%gespenst25> I like the buff robot mini game
[0:25:50] <pimpinahz> lol I'm new to ff14 so literally everyone is talking gibberish to me
[0:25:54] <MoonObscure> they are turning my AST into a boring whitre mage now...
[0:26:00] <%Venhammer> @timbob its the best theme park mmo
[0:26:00] <cizal11> @AngriestPat i just feel like they went too far in the other direction tbh
[0:26:01] <@SSaryn> Dont forget about the bad AST who just puts that fucking attack speed buff on any melee DPS.
[0:26:02] <%TombstoneTTromboners> the 10000 mp change is so good
[0:26:02] <iheartmota> now every card is balance
[0:26:04] <FairOnFire> @timbob try the free trial
[0:26:05] <SweetCuppingCake> I always turn my spires and such into lady or lord of crowns
[0:26:12] <%AquilaHarukaze> I'm going to be SO happy to see TP gone
[0:26:13] <elisascarlet> Enhanced Arrow on BLM PogChamp
[0:26:14] <%nmaten> oh so theyre all the good cards
[0:26:17] <%parkenbear> parkenbear subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:26:19] <%ogtrashwizard> @angriestpat yesterday I had to tank as a NIN because the Tank ragequit with the asshole potato BLM, it was the most surreal run I've had
[0:26:20] <%Farples> Hello people
[0:26:25] <+UberWolfman> Now all the healers are WHM LUL
[0:26:31] <Calamity2007> @MoonObscure "ONLY HEAL" -FFXIV Devs probably
[0:26:31] <%EmiinV> I'm going to miss having haste, it was unique and fun
[0:26:35] <%father_hill> @AngriestPat So i'm trying to plow through the story content so i can get ready for shadowbringer with my Machinist, i know it's bad but fuck you i want my fantasy man to have a glock. im thinking about picking up a healer, which one would you reccomend to learn healing?
[0:26:38] <+TheImmortal70> WHM is better WHm
[0:26:38] <freya_mystel> dude you have never saved a pull with an aoe bole
[0:26:39] <tsuchi7> what even is the point of having cards if they all do the same shit
[0:26:47] <Covil91> Because having 1 card better than the others was good
[0:26:48] <+TheImmortal70> WHM wins A FUCK TON
[0:26:49] <%HajimenoStream> what's the live letter covering
[0:26:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> best def is BIG ATACC
[0:26:53] <Stay_Knight> AND WINGS
[0:26:53] <%TombstoneTTromboners> WHM is so good
[0:26:53] <CountMeowingtonn> i have pretty wings AngelThump
[0:26:54] <A_Red_Robot> @AngriestPat Thoughts on the DRK changes?
[0:26:55] <haveswordmuststing> @SSaryn is it because it doubles as spell speed or is it not worth wasting that card, dont play AST
[0:26:56] <MoonObscure> f whm
[0:26:57] <%QuadraticGravity> Gonna miss giving Monks an Arrow
[0:26:58] <%spiritofmojave> Wings are fucking rad
[0:27:02] <%CitrusDrink> and 900 potency is a BIG NUMBER
[0:27:05] <%TombstoneTTromboners> WHM becoming the healer + dps is great
[0:27:09] <+TheImmortal70> You got two dot heals, like 3 overall healing BUFFS, ridiculous damage, 4 free heals
[0:27:10] <roofkie> does this game require grinding?
[0:27:12] <RamenRiderZ> Oh boy, soon done with the first warrior relic
[0:27:12] <IndoorSitup> RIP IN PEACE SCHOLARS
[0:27:15] <SweetCuppingCake> I would use enhanced boles for really bad tanks, lol
[0:27:15] <+Grayhammatter> final steps is so good
[0:27:16] <Calamity2007> I guess I should try leveling White Mage as my healer class then
[0:27:16] <$JojoPiero> I'm so excited for GNB, the Dante fingersnap on Royal Guard is a nice touch
[0:27:18] <LordFalara> i played the pvp a few days ago and it was some suck
[0:27:21] <%JustAnotherMuffin> FINAL STEPS!!!
[0:27:22] <Stay_Knight> Stormblood goes way faster
[0:27:22] <ColRedyx> They've changed job quests before. The gatherer quests still tell you to get Carbonized Matter but the NPC says it's no longer used these days and basically just exists for you to practice on.
[0:27:28] <cizal11> @haveswordmuststing he's just wrong in general. using arrow on something is ALWAYS a benefit over not using a card in that time.
[0:27:28] <+TheImmortal70> A button that makes everything faster, a button that makes everything FREE
[0:27:29] <+metalsiren31> SO GOOD
[0:27:33] <%Venhammer> it total is
[0:27:33] <LordFalara> its prettt fucking good
[0:27:34] <%QuadraticGravity> Dragonsong Kreygasm
[0:27:35] <%maskedriderhero> The final verse is sung!!!
[0:27:36] <bragokingeternal> such a good boss
[0:27:36] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat What ivl should I be by SB? I'm currently at 369
[0:27:37] <soliammurr> @JojoPiero DO THEY ACTUALLY SNAP THEIR FINGERS??
[0:27:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> yeah that was rad.
[0:27:38] <%JustAnotherMuffin> I literly cried.
[0:27:42] <Stay_Knight> 100%
[0:27:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@valriot) (warning)
[0:27:45] <Covil91> That slow walk towards the boss! so good
[0:27:45] <%nmaten> with the best song in the game
[0:27:46] <Calamity2007> It definitely is in my top 3 trials, if not the best
[0:27:46] <jackythefrost> Its awesome
[0:27:49] <%spiritofmojave> I think it is when you hear the trailer theme kick in with THAT guy and the dergon
[0:27:50] <bestwaifuritsu> Dogg's Rage is the best fucking trial behind Thordan.
[0:27:51] <+metalsiren31> *Akh Morn intensifies*
[0:28:00] <LordFalara> THROW IT OFF
[0:28:00] <Calamity2007> Aymeric is a fucking goober
[0:28:00] <Revawo> "some nice assists of some old pals" ;___;
[0:28:01] <$valriot> THROW THEM OFF THE CLIFF
[0:28:01] <AdmiralButtloaf> and under the moonlight is the best part of stormblood
[0:28:03] <%JustAnotherMuffin> Those assists. mathsquadSad
[0:28:05] <sovayell> It's tied with Shinryu with best boss theme
[0:28:05] <AndySoryu> I knew as soon as it happened they would come back, its so dumb
[0:28:06] <SaltyBrim> That was so funny
[0:28:09] <+Grayhammatter> just throw them 4Head
[0:28:10] <%GingaNZ> dumbest thing in the game

[0:29:06] <sovayell> Whens this live letter start?
[0:29:06] <bestwaifuritsu> Surely dropping these accursed items from a nigh immortal being from a great height will destroy them!
[0:29:08] <+FennecZephyr> So yeah I just need to keep plowing through on my Paly
[0:29:08] <SweetCuppingCake> @kiiiirsten Thank you! :D
[0:29:09] <+IAmAkiva> i'm confused
[0:29:15] <%maskedriderhero> @CitrusDrink Well, the winds and waters down in that valley are so turbulent and crazy dangerous that no normal person could actually go down there and survive, it's an elemental orgy basically
[0:29:15] <%JustAnotherMuffin> @citrusdrink Well I think in the lore nothing is suppose to survive going down there. That's why they needed Cloak Bois to get them
[0:29:16] <+Pendlez> XIV has some a tier boyfriends. hien can come get this
[0:29:19] <%blastazoid26> ??????
[0:29:20] <bragokingeternal> @AngriestPat can you turn the music down a bit
[0:29:22] <+TheImmortal70> You get a 100% bonus up to 10 levels below cap, then 50% on
[0:29:24] <%MetalPanic> MetalPanic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:29:27] <%spiritofmojave> Armory bonus + earrings + guild shit Kreygasm
[0:29:29] <%DavidSanChan> That's good to know, time to maraud harder
[0:29:29] <ColRedyx> There's more than just the armory bonus. You also get WAY more gil that will help you just buy gear and teleport as much as you want, plus access to more roulettes. Always cap one job before you go hard on any alts.
[0:29:32] <+TheImmortal70> If you have a class at max
[0:29:34] <%Stonebeard> I'm having trouble, I want to play the game but there's so many cool changes coming in ShB that I also just want to wait until 28th so I can level a tank.
[0:29:38] <Stay_Knight> Better Husbandos in XIV than waifus
[0:29:40] <%Bigdrifter210> im a GLA when do i get PLD?
[0:29:40] <+Karasseram> 1 min till delays
[0:29:42] <CrowsSanctuary> @angriestpat what do you think of cadence of hyrule.
[0:29:45] <%valkuma> Pat is wrong about the experience bonuses as he is used to the old method
[0:29:46] <cizal11> @AngriestPat CORRECTION: the armory bonus applies for any class at any level, if you have 30 whatever, your 1-29 whatever else will have 100% bonus xp. you don't need to cap AT ALL for armory bonus to apply.
[0:29:49] <TioXyco> @Bigdrifter210 level 30
[0:29:51] <bragokingeternal> @angriestpat thanks man
[0:29:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat can u turn the music up a little bit? ;3
[0:29:53] <Stay_Knight> You get PLD at 30
[0:29:53] <Calamity2007> @maskedriderhero Apparently not dangerous enough for someone with a boner for Ala Mhigo
[0:30:00] <+MechaBaphomet> does that apply to the crafting classes?
[0:30:02] <%castcode> !
[0:30:02] <bestwaifuritsu> habbening
[0:30:02] <+IAmAkiva> 30
[0:30:04] <%valkuma> All that matters is having a Job above the job you are leveling and you get the full experience bonus. Does not matter if you are capped or not.

[0:30:14] <%xShahalx> I’m grossly over leveled just doing the MSQ and class/job quests and the game is feeling a bit clunky because of it. For example not being able to get my mount until lvl 35. Any tips to lessening this disparity?

[0:48:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> 80 trial is probably gonna be something to do with the big spoiler from the last trailer
[0:48:13] <cizal11> @AngriestPat we've already found out basically everything. basically, it's only for leveling dungeons, and that's it
[0:48:14] <%TheKingCame> TheKingCame subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[0:48:37] <%DavidSanChan> black rose from .hack
[0:48:37] <Aetropos> she went goth with blm
[0:48:40] <%Typhaeon> The Trust System, featuring Keanu Reeves
[0:48:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> yshtola is a black mage in this expansion.
[0:48:44] <+IAmAkiva> I'm so influenced.
[0:48:46] <unlimited_osteopath> was Minfilia always this creepy?
[0:48:46] <Calamity2007> @UKOrigin I mean this expansion is essentially Goth Phase the game
[0:48:47] <%spiritofmojave> Also Thancred looks like Dante and hot now
[0:48:49] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL Yshtola is not hot, shes an old lady who glamours her face because she hates being old. This is a fact.
[0:48:49] <%Alopekis> influenzer
[0:48:50] <DrGasMax> God, they are just making Thancred into Nier aren't they?
[0:48:51] <%maskedriderhero> Yoshi! Give us dating mechanics!
[0:48:55] <Thorn14> wait Main Scenario Only?
[0:48:55] <r_Foeburden87> Matoysh'tola thats a great one
[0:48:56] <+REDtheBEAST> Points of POWER!
[0:48:57] <%kiiiirsten> Wow........
[0:49:00] <Aetropos> look at yoship's character right there
[0:49:01] <sjcodan> Yaaaaay
[0:49:01] <$SinisterBroccoli> Hey Pat, just finished my Cronus Lux weapon
[0:49:09] <%doggettxalex> she absolutely did have that eyeliner
[0:49:13] <切捨御免> real WoL female lala confirmed
[0:49:13] <Thorn14> Ooooh so you cant do side ones.
[0:49:15] <$JojoPiero> They simulate real parties, where the Lv80 Tank will roll on anything you might want for leveling later, just because they can
[0:49:16] <Stay_Knight> They previously announced that
[0:49:20] <%THATGUY_789> wow
[0:49:20] <cizal11> yep. leveling only. and maybe also the level 80 story dungeon.
[0:49:23] <sovayell> PLEASE apply this to the ARR main scenario final dungeons
[0:49:23] <Neoripo> @AngriestPat Why it's so dark?
[0:49:37] <Jakeofalco> @AngriestPat you have more viewers then mr happy right now
[0:49:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> so I can make Alphinaud tank? RAD.
[0:49:37] <%Alopekis> @bestwaifuritsu She's still hot
[0:49:39] <Aetropos> so you can read the text
[0:49:41] <%spiritofmojave> Figured side shit with Trust system wouldn't really be compatible with server load
[0:49:43] <pandangerous> it's dark because it's shadowbringers obviously
[0:49:44] <%doggettxalex> because that's what the screen looks like, i assume so you can read
[0:49:44] <+smevvster> If you don't want to/can't play with other plays don't play an MMO why is that so hard to understand.
[0:49:47] <13sin> ah this will alleviate DPS queue problems for MSQ dungeons
[0:49:48] <+Grayhammatter> big shadows
[0:49:49] <floatRand> It is to make text more readable
[0:49:49] <Stay_Knight> This will be great for leveling DPS
[0:49:49] <%Typhaeon> It's not called Lighting Bringers
[0:49:51] <切捨御免> fuck you pat
[0:49:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Someone brought the shadows.
[0:49:56] <Neoripo> So inmersive!
[0:49:56] <@Pandora_Prime> This is what they were testing in Gymlit Dark
[0:50:13] <%THATGUY_789> shadow puzzles
[0:50:18] <%megabrogus> Are they still in L.A. or are they back in Japan
[0:50:26] <%OdysseyKnight> Also the GC squads
[0:50:36] <%maskedriderhero> I want a party of just waifus
[0:50:37] <bestwaifuritsu> I have never seen anyone but Yugiri do an ultimate in GD
[0:50:38] <%caffeinomancer> Tbh this would be pretty helpful for levelling DPS classes
[0:50:40] <worldbrand> are you all ready to be the ones to fill their light souls with dark?
[0:50:44] <r_Foeburden87> So Gamit like shit
[0:50:45] <切捨御免> "robust"
[0:50:47] <+EriksBlue> its works kinda ok in Squadron system
[0:50:49] <+Grayhammatter> ROBUST
[0:50:51] <Thalchampz> I WISH
[0:50:51] <MoonObscure> yup
[0:50:52] <zombiedinosour> i GOT free HAVENSWORD so happy
[0:50:52] <Neoripo> I miss Soundbringer man
[0:50:53] <ShichiNoBushi> "Get out of the zones, you idiots!!!!"
[0:50:55] <Calamity2007> They wont though
[0:50:55] <Thalchampz> it would be cool
[0:50:56] <Stay_Knight> Just for leveling purposes
[0:50:57] <+sindrantz> that would be much much later though @AngriestPat
[0:50:57] <Finakala> Novv is part of the Trust system with his advanced Fish AI
[0:50:58] <Aetropos> I love that alisaie will spend LB asap
[0:50:59] <r_Foeburden87> Gambit*
[0:51:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> Sadly that'd take so much work
[0:51:02] <+EatinEden> does this mean I don’t have to wait 20 min for a dungeon jnbAw
[0:51:05] <hometownman> I want Estinien trust plz
[0:51:06] <+Raidou24> Yea it feels like Squadrons were a prototype for this
[0:51:08] <+REDtheBEAST> ADJUST
[0:51:09] <cizal11> @AngriestPat they've mentioned potentially going back to do that, but for now it's unclear
[0:51:09] <+Ell1ot> where's Paige?
[0:51:13] <%GingaNZ> GOOD
[0:51:15] <unlimited_osteopath> the AI in command missions suck, though
[0:51:16] <MoonObscure> lul
[0:51:17] <+Grayhammatter> GOOD
[0:51:17] <%Alopekis> I can't even do my real job correctly
[0:51:18] <Stay_Knight> HAH
[0:51:18] <$Yakobro> LUL
[0:51:20] <@Pandora_Prime> Be kinda weird since most of those dungeons they don't have those characters with you
[0:51:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[0:51:24] <%THATGUY_789> haha
[0:51:25] <r_Foeburden87> BANTEr
[0:51:25] <+UKOrigin> h e l l - y e a h
[0:51:26] <%Typhaeon> Bants, Yeah
[0:51:26] <Covil91> The trusts are scripted. Every dungeon is personally programmed
[0:51:27] <sovayell> banter confirmed, nice
[0:51:28] <切捨御免> IMMERSION
[0:51:29] <%spiritofmojave> we gonna get S-links with Yshtola, Thancred, etc. now?
[0:51:29] <%Venhammer> banter, nice
[0:51:29] <Morsuzado> well that's a nice change
[0:51:30] <%caffeinomancer> Oh no people have to learn their jobs now? Whatever next?
[0:51:32] <millenniuss> To the dps gulag
[0:51:32] <sjcodan> Dialouge, fuck ye
[0:51:36] <Psyramics> lookin forward to never playing with a human being ever again in my MMO
[0:51:39] <%Agami23> just got back, are these for all existing main scenario dungeons, or just new ones?
[0:51:40] <Finakala> M'naago please
[0:51:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Realistic heckling AI.
[0:51:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> BANTS EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[0:51:45] <%castcode> lmao
[0:51:46] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@raknikmik) (warning)
[0:51:49] <+Karasseram> only new ones
[0:51:50] <+UKOrigin> its a well known fact that a large portion of the ff14 playerbase are not good atall
[0:51:50] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I want this in old dungeon too. adventure squadron is fun but there's only a few you can do
[0:51:50] <%akingofnoobs> akingofnoobs subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Got my wisdom teeth pulled out and Im stuck in the house for the next few days while I bleed everywhere. Thanks for making my day more enjoyable!
[0:51:53] <%castcode> Big Bantz System
[0:51:54] <gustavozxd> are the npc gonna talk shit too?
[0:51:54] <+Cigwynn> Let Myrlweb join me in my Dungeon zoneHype
[0:51:55] <Thalchampz> Aymeric for dedicated blowjobs
[0:51:56] <%juxtest> Alka Zolka is where its at
[0:51:58] <%doggettxalex> Haurchefant NPC pls
[0:52:01] <切捨御免> curious gorge is too busy getting into what's-her-face's curious gorge to help
[0:52:02] <ArkSeaside> Fray? :)
[0:52:02] <A_Family_Man> I get to be with my boi Hauch again!
[0:52:05] <Stay_Knight> Since they have interactions they will probably not have too many
[0:52:05] <%OdysseyKnight> Doesn't matter if it is more effective because then you gotta share loot
[0:52:05] <animeshaquilleoneil> Trachtoum when
[0:52:06] <hometownman> Estinien purease
[0:52:07] <cizal11> ff11 has like more than a hundred trusts, i'd be surprised if 14 stayed limited to like 4/5.
[0:52:08] <unlimited_osteopath> @AngriestPat but does Thancred pull wall-to-wall? I need my massive pulls.
[0:52:15] <+Jajanken4> so just story ones, not all the optional ones?
[0:52:17] <Morsuzado> now I don't need to heal for a tank that refuses to use a tank stance
[0:52:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> @doggettxalex too soon
[0:52:23] <zajoestar> oof 30mins
[0:52:23] <13sin> 30min is faster than most shitty pugs
[0:52:24] <jackythefrost> For side dungeons and trials you still need to play with people
[0:52:27] <%doggettxalex> it's been 2 years @rumtumtugnutz
[0:52:27] <%OdysseyKnight> Where I do the dungeon alone I get all the loot unless the NPCs are rolling for it
[0:52:32] <%yeknomlive> itd be asking too much but it would be cool to switch per character
[0:52:33] <%Fatmanjoggin> I hope they use this in Manderville quests somehow
[0:52:36] <Aetropos> oh, restart completely??
[0:52:38] <+Grayhammatter> oh...
[0:52:38] <%Arnschen> Oh huh
[0:52:40] <Thalchampz> ooooh
[0:52:40] <+PharosOfLight> Persona 3 rules
[0:52:40] <Thorn14> Oh god
[0:52:41] <thewhiterice92> Fuck, Persona dungeon rules huh
[0:52:42] <Thalchampz> that's cool
[0:52:42] <Thepothero> oh shit
[0:52:42] <AndySoryu> a 30 minute dungeon for dps is fine considering queues as well.
[0:52:43] <+Greywyn00> don't be bad
[0:52:43] <%spiritofmojave> oof
[0:52:43] <Takanub> Persona rules
[0:52:43] <%QuadraticGravity> Just like Squadrons
[0:52:44] <sovayell> AI healer cant adjust
[0:52:45] <AdmiralButtloaf> like squadrons
[0:52:47] <alrobot2014> so the npcs don't give a fuck about healing you
[0:52:49] <skyourat> kinda like squadrons
[0:52:50] <+Promessa_EX> Dragon's dogma rules
[0:52:51] <+Grayhammatter> so, don't be bad
[0:52:52] <hometownman> Casuals btfo
[0:52:54] <alrobot2014> or raising more like
[0:52:55] <+EriksBlue> par have you not done GC squads?
[0:52:55] <bluescreen1988> get good

[0:53:04] <17sevens> that's discrimination against black mages
[0:53:04] <Lotharman> Your character is also deleted, so you gotta restart from ARR LUL
[0:53:05] <MoonObscure> actual real healer , no adjust for you
[0:53:05] <%spiritofmojave> Urianger cannot adjust
[0:53:08] <%Alopekis> I'm bad by default
[0:53:08] <Stay_Knight> Hoo wipe mechanics
[0:53:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Urianger ain't dealing with you "healers adjust" bullshit
[0:53:10] <+SlowLikeThunder> really hope the healing ai is good on that as a tank main

[0:53:21] <+SlowLikeThunder> because that sounds like a tank nightmare if the healing ai is bad
[0:53:23] <%GingaNZ> people gonna be blaming the AI for no carrying them
[0:53:29] <hometownman> Alisae doesnt even have rez on her hotbar
[0:53:31] <pandangerous> job effectiveness will vary depending on player skill

[0:58:48] <+Raidou24> Yoshi has 69 million Gil...Nice
[0:58:49] <Onmi_Khaos> it's funny @AngriestPat because Minfilia is in one of the FF Gacha games, Record Keeper. And in it she's a Paladin because... they didn't have anything else for her to DO based on previous stuff
[0:58:55] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[0:58:56] <Finakala> That dungeon gate what

[0:59:05] <+king_of_beggars> It's a minigolf
[0:59:06] <Coffee_JD> stargate tech
[0:59:07] <damienlunas> Because Alphinaud uses Carbuncles, not fairies, so he's not a scholar. That makes sense.
[0:59:08] <sovayell> look at this crazy golf course LUL

[1:01:25] <%shawntk_> THANK YOU
[1:01:26] <Smileyhat> Big pulls mean you spend the dungeon mashing one button instead of actually playing your class.

[1:01:26] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat OH GOD I KNOW
[1:01:27] <+bbHighvalor> bardems is the worst
[1:01:28] <+DAIROCKETTO> if any tank does that extreme pull shit i just don't heal them. i hold their life in my hands
[1:01:29] <Maldoree> for those in the back
[1:01:29] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Arnschen) (warning)
[1:01:29] <sjcodan> EYEYYEYEe
[1:01:29] <Eltruis> @AngriestPat can you mix AI in with playing with other players? like if you are missing your healer friend can you get a AI to fill that spot?

[1:01:32] <$JojoPiero> Bardams was always the fucking worst for that shit
[1:01:33] <+alphonseisbest> Thank u
[1:01:33] <Forester_Skippy> tancred will grab em if you pul lem back with you and survive that
[1:01:33] <KatabolicRage> and blames the healer
[1:01:33] <+Raidou24> I HAD THAT 2 DAYS AGO
[1:01:33] <%THATGUY_789> I had that last night
[1:01:33] <%Typhaeon> Fuck that guy
[1:01:34] <iheartmota> LMAO
[1:01:34] <Thorn14> and then complains to the Healer
[1:01:34] <%terry_quest> or just leaves
[1:01:34] <KilroyGrin532> Isn't that you, though? Kappa
[1:01:36] <%AquilaHarukaze> THE ANTI-SHIRE ARTILLERY
[1:01:36] <%thefishofwar> yuuuuup

[1:01:39] <Maldoree> PREACH THE GOOD WORD
[1:01:39] <+Grayhammatter> thank you pat, those are the worst
[1:01:40] <hometownman> People do that?
[1:01:40] <%JonnyFodder> Thank you Pat. As a slow tank, that makes me feel better.
[1:01:41] <sovayell> impatient tanks are THE WORST
[1:01:41] <+killer_squid1990> The guy who pulls the entire dungeon but doesn't pop cooldowns
[1:01:41] <AndySoryu> No the worst is when they die and blame everyone else
[1:01:41] <sjcodan> I NEED BiGGER PULLS
[1:01:42] <+textandnumbers> i had that. had to pop caster LB to save the tank
[1:01:42] <Thorn14> and then hes like "HEALER OMFG"
[1:01:42] <%Suchawus> and its always places like Mettle, too
[1:01:42] <cizal11> @AngriestPat no one does that unless they're morons. that's too much for anyone on earth to tank.
[1:01:42] <%shadowace2400> why would you grab EVERYONE
[1:01:43] <+alphonseisbest> YUUUUUUUP
[1:01:43] <+Kavtech> YEAH THAT'S HOW IT IS
[1:01:44] <$JojoPiero> Bardams is WHY I started maining tank in SB
[1:01:44] <%yeknomlive> than they say "uh heal me?"
[1:01:45] <Kerozero> Healer need to adjust Kappa
[1:01:47] <indig0bird> Someone in Castrum of Main Scenario did that and left
[1:01:47] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat I had someone do that, switch to tank accessories, and then do it again. Melted instantly
[1:01:47] <Derkinstacker> Heal better pat
[1:01:48] <%sshen> HEALERS ADJUST
[1:01:49] <%THATGUY_789> didn't even get a chance tonheal
[1:01:50] <reinbachthe3rd> @AngriestPat I just hit level 20 the other day in FFXIV the other day.
[1:01:51] <+Risingxiv> HEALER ADJUST!
[1:01:52] <sjcodan> I NEED TO BRiNG THE MOBS INTO THE BOSS FIGHT
[1:01:52] <Aetropos> My fav is when they're undergeared to shit doing that LUL
[1:01:53] <%CitrusDrink> The fucker who insists on never being within line of sight of the healer when pulling too
[1:01:53] <cizal11> @AngriestPat that doesn't mean don't do smaller multipulls
[1:01:56] <+REDtheBEAST> Fuck big pullers walrusMeow
[1:01:58] <%JustAnotherMuffin> God Black Mage looks so boring to play. How do they do it?
[1:02:00] <%Typhaeon> Just heal more 4Head
[1:02:01] <%AquilaHarukaze> Those fucking furballs hit SO hard holy shit.
[1:02:03] <Thorn14> Just heal more 4Head
[1:02:03] <Stay_Knight> *joins dungeon* *dies once* *leaves*
[1:02:03] <+Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat how can you tell if you can handle big pulls?
[1:02:05] <%Solshine11> THAT’S THAT GOOOD SHIT
[1:02:05] <MonstarGrrrl> yust heal more 4Head
[1:02:05] <%Mev852_> ffxiv needs a better voice chat system
[1:02:05] <Thalchampz> YEAH YOU FUCKER
[1:02:07] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat Are you a big pull or small pull type of guy?
[1:02:07] <+Grayhammatter> just heal more 4Head
[1:02:10] <+LowBatteryLife> what is this legally-distinct dance of sugarplum fairies
[1:02:12] <%castcode> Use the big heal 4Head
[1:02:13] <KatabolicRage> in leveling dungeons peoples gear is usually spotty so big pulls is a bad idea
[1:02:13] <+metalsiren31> pvpLUL
[1:02:13] <+Akabane101> Just heal gooder. 4Head
[1:02:14] <Onmi_Khaos> I will often ask my team if they want to do a big pull
[1:02:14] <%yeknomlive> do i have to put freeze back on my bar?
[1:02:18] <%THATGUY_789> only so much mp
[1:02:19] <cizal11> @Mev852_ it's called discord lol
[1:02:20] <HibikiYamada> I've done it before.
[1:02:23] <bluescreen1988> some tanks just think healers make them invincible
[1:02:23] <calamitan> it's almost like there's more than one kind of bad tank
[1:02:23] <hometownman> these numbers making me cream my pants
[1:02:24] <Forester_Skippy> if you try topull big i nbardams before the firs tboss you will die so hard
[1:02:24] <damienlunas> I pull to the wall on Bardam's Mettle all the time, but the Tank has to be super good
[1:02:25] <Finakala> Bardem's big pulls is like first room Aurum pulls, suicide
[1:02:25] <%Agami23> if you hate that, you just need to learn to adjust to bigger teams Kappa
[1:02:26] <Onmi_Khaos> The worst part is everyone going "Yes" and the moment I grab the first group they attack.
[1:02:28] <%yeknomlive> you have to tell the healer
[1:02:28] <+butch_deadlift> fucking useless healers reeeeee
[1:02:28] <Calamity2007> No you know what is even worst, when you are tank and do a pull but the rest of the party goes forward anyway to force a big pull causing the party to wipe and then call you a bad tank
[1:02:29] <sjcodan> Just ask the healer if its ok
[1:02:29] <$JojoPiero> @JustAnotherMuffin By looking at the 40k crits on aoe attacks
[1:02:30] <Tucker0603> thank God I'm not that tank
[1:02:31] <fairore> hey pat
[1:02:31] <Hidashi13> any king cactuars in 14?
[1:02:32] <+BubbaRands> Am I watching a guy, watching guys play a video game?
[1:02:32] <RamenRiderZ> *doesnt use cooldowns* "what the fuck healer"
[1:02:33] <crazyer> No healing in the world can make up for shit gear
[1:02:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't enjoy bardem's mettle
[1:02:38] <buddy0993> also USE YOUR FUCKING COOLDOWNS
[1:02:42] <Stay_Knight> When you feel comfy with the dungeon and understand it
[1:02:42] <Sloavon> people need to play every roll before they should be allowed to play an role online
[1:02:43] <%bluetocho13> thats why i ask before pulling big
[1:02:45] <%Remery_> Big Pulls for Big Bois
[1:02:45] <Mexicanskydiver> also how good if the tank is good with agro control
[1:02:46] <soliammurr> HIS VOICE
[1:02:47] <AndySoryu> do smaller pulls on your first run, then afterwards whatever you want
[1:02:48] <Veluren> Urianger just cast a "Death" spell
[1:02:48] <$SleepyMaribo> @Raspada_Ryner at the start of a dungeon, you check your healer and if they are geared. Also doesnt hurt to ask if the healer will be ok for a the big pull.
[1:02:49] <Luish_GO> also as a tank use your F CDs
[1:02:49] <切捨御免> BIG RP coming out from urianger
[1:02:50] <cizal11> yeah at the end of the day, it doesn't even matter how good tanks or healers are if dps can't do any fuckin dps
[1:02:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't do big pulls on your first run of a dungeon.
[1:02:53] <Psyramics> check to see how much the healer is healing vs how much they're dpsing and if they're spending more time dpsing than healing, you pull more
[1:02:55] <Beefchief33> Will you die?if so don't do big pull
[1:02:55] <LordFalara> i dont even remember bardems mettle is it the xaela dungeon
[1:02:57] <Thorn14> I adore this zone.
[1:03:00] <%yeknomlive> Banter PogChamp
[1:03:00] <%arcaderabbit48> God damn Urianger, calm down. They'
[1:03:02] <+BubbaRands> Dem flowers be purtty
[1:03:02] <%spiritofmojave> Most tanks I've randomly quenued with won't ask shit so you gotta state it yourself
[1:03:03] <%clempstwitch> hnghhhh my aesthetic
[1:03:04] <%TombstoneTTromboners> FOCUS MINFILLIA
[1:03:04] <Calamity2007> @LordFalara Yes
[1:03:06] <%THATGUY_789> Wisteria
[1:03:06] <unlimited_osteopath> Thancred's like "stfu"
[1:03:08] <Aetropos> dps that single target even in huge pulls FeelsBadMan
[1:03:08] <Derkinstacker> I hate when the healer says "i got it" but they don't got it and they blame everyone else.
[1:03:08] <sjcodan> If the dungeon's been out over a year, its big oulls
[1:03:08] <%JustAnotherMuffin> @JojoPiero yeah I don't feel anything from seeing big number so it just isnt for me.
[1:03:11] <%OdysseyKnight> Moff
[1:03:13] <RosELLo6> urianger's that bitch with yu-gi-oh macros
[1:03:13] <xstormyone> yoshis hotbars are 1 2 4 and 5 my ocd is killing me
[1:03:14] <RamenRiderZ> Budgetbringers
[1:03:15] <LordFalara> wasnt a big fan of that dungeon
[1:03:16] <+mik255> are the lines voiced?
[1:03:17] <Takanub> I find that just doing two pack pulls is enough to speed up any run while not really overtaxing the healerr
[1:03:23] <%Finaldragoon> proper positioning PogChamp
[1:03:25] <fairore> there's too much stuff on the screen :/
[1:03:26] <cizal11> thancred finally gets to live his dream of being minfillias dad
[1:03:27] <%yeknomlive> omg the though of an npc having those dumb macros
[1:03:27] <Morsuzado> if you are a tank and try to pull more than 2 groups at a time with randos, you suck.
[1:03:29] <Onmi_Khaos> It might be slow but at least Thancred wont drop aggro
[1:03:32] <CarrotWhisky> @mik255 Not all, seemingly
[1:03:33] <Stay_Knight> So this Minfilia is mute
[1:03:34] <TheViltsuZ> Does this game have any cool special attacks?
[1:03:35] <+Akabane101> Nothing makes me butt clench more than a tank with bad gear pulling way more than he can handle.
[1:03:36] <sjcodan> Fuck
[1:03:36] <$Garthunox> How did thancred become a GB?
[1:03:36] <CountMeowingtonn> wait is thancred minfilia's dad now
[1:03:38] <%GarbageNirvana> yeah the more I play AST the less I appreciate big pulls
[1:03:40] <sjcodan> But my pulls
[1:03:41] <Calamity2007> GOOD
[1:03:41] <Aetropos> I love those walls too
[1:03:41] <ShutUpAceyP> grinding should be easier for dps with this trust system
[1:03:42] <floatRand> That will fucking drive me mad
[1:03:49] <CountMeowingtonn> @Garthunox he did the job quest, duh
[1:03:53] <%NWR_James> F I S T
[1:03:53] <%yeknomlive> become what you must
[1:03:53] <%caffeinomancer> I love that Urianger is DPS'ing too
[1:03:54] <%TombstoneTTromboners> we'll find out
[1:03:55] <floatRand> He also got new eye
[1:03:56] <%frsttcs> he studied the gunblade
[1:03:57] <sovayell> temple of the fist is a super fun dungeon
[1:04:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@JojoPiero) (warning)
[1:04:01] <xeros720> thancred started at level 1 and did his class quests
[1:04:02] <+Radalorian> he broke so many guns
[1:04:04] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Do you think Matoya takes over Yshtola's body like the crazy Theories or just comes back like everyone else.
[1:04:05] <%Agami23> LEY LINES
[1:04:05] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat he bought shadowbringers
[1:04:06] <Thorn14> D:

[1:04:06] <ShutUpAceyP> they've been doing that since ARR 2.3 or 4?
[1:04:07] <Lotharman> Is this the first time we see YoshiP playing this much?
[1:04:07] <cizal11> @AngriestPat that stuff is fine in leveling dungeons, but shouldn't be in expert level stuff. you could pull so much more than they let you.
[1:04:07] <Thorn14> REPORT
[1:04:09] <%nmaten> he tried hard and believed in himself
[1:04:10] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp
[1:04:10] <floatRand> Urianger knows what's up
[1:04:11] <%TombstoneTTromboners> HEAL URIANGER
[1:04:12] <Calamity2007> Thancred has gone through the most class changes out of all the NPCs
[1:04:15] <Forester_Skippy> he does more than 90% of the healers
[1:04:16] <Kerozero> Good
[1:04:17] <indig0bird> Urianger looks so dope now
[1:04:17] <%spiritofmojave> Urianger knows his shit
[1:04:18] <%Arnschen> Hrmm, interesting
[1:04:18] <Thorn14> BAD HEALER
[1:04:18] <%Typhaeon> That NPC pays his sub.
[1:04:19] <%miguelrod777> my boi
[1:04:19] <+UKOrigin> urianger just became top tier fo rme
[1:04:20] <+metalsiren31> Even NPCs can DPS better than some pug healers. Sounds about right
[1:04:21] <ArkSeaside> better than most pug healers smh
[1:04:22] <cizal11> urianger confirmed better than 50% of df healers
[1:04:23] <$valriot> ALPHA URI
[1:04:23] <%Stonebeard> You don't pay Urianger's sub
[1:04:23] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat doesnt hurt to ask if the healer will be ok with pulling big. I had a healer ask me to tone it down and i kindly obliged .
[1:04:27] <Thorn14> Didn't he read the patch notes?!
[1:04:28] <bestwaifuritsu> Thancred became a furry and started hanging out with Hrothgars, who invented gunblade combat to protect their cat queen
[1:04:29] <ShutUpAceyP> just add more dps to healers
[1:04:29] <CountMeowingtonn> healers gonna bitch about their boring dps moves i'll just play with urianger than
[1:04:30] <hometownman> bad urianger, do ur job and pay ur sub >:(
[1:04:38] <%spiritofmojave> I pay your sub Uri LUL
[1:04:39] <Veluren> @AngriestPat On one of those pulls Urianger cast a spell called "Death of the Scions" and it looked like it just insta-killed trash
[1:04:40] <indig0bird> His looks as a WoD infiltrator were the best
[1:04:42] <SmarkyMC> 4Head
[1:04:50] <+Grayhammatter> just don't get hit 4Head
[1:04:50] <xeros720> he's doing a fine job healing thancred
[1:04:51] <%juxtest> Thancred pays Urianger's sub confirmed
[1:04:53] <fairore> don't get hit
[1:04:55] <RadShiro> BETTER than DF
[1:04:55] <%yeknomlive> better than lvling roulette
[1:04:56] <Calamity2007> Wow this is better than some of the parties I go with
[1:04:56] <%JustAnotherMuffin> They will play better than some DPS
[1:04:59] <xeros720> lets see a boss though, to be sure
[1:04:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Not to hard to code, I presume.
[1:04:59] <cizal11> your squadron sure as fuck doesn't do that lmao
[1:05:00] <+Raidou24> Uriange does it... YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE HEALERS
[1:05:01] <$SleepyMaribo> they have better reaction time then most players
[1:05:01] <+Angrec> that feeling when npcs do mechanics better than most people
[1:05:02] <+Fonzies_Jacket> all that healer DPS PogChamp
[1:05:06] <r_Foeburden87> i mean the SWTOR homies are this good also
[1:05:07] <damienlunas> legitimately better than the average DF
[1:05:09] <trashamn> Better than actual players
[1:05:09] <$JojoPiero> I wonder if they're still gonna make Thancred all weird and lovey towards Minfilia, it's Japan so like I almost expect it but even then
[1:05:09] <$valriot> Black Mage though Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:05:10] <+Grayhammatter> this is already infinitely better than DF
[1:05:12] <%frsttcs> these are AI are smarter than half of the people you play with
[1:05:14] <Neoripo> B-but I am a Floor Tank!
[1:05:14] <@Pandora_Prime> Better than human teammates. Sorry Pat I don't need you guys anymore.
[1:05:15] <Edajos> that freeze change is so good, I can't handle it
[1:05:16] <blackcloud288> Did I miss the stream?
[1:05:16] <%spiritofmojave> Minfilia with a knife better than most NIN's
[1:05:17] <cizal11> wait is this gonna be the whole dungeon? or just up to the first boss
[1:05:21] <RamenRiderZ> Already better than most eu df
[1:05:22] <Thorn14> But I was told healer doing DPS is wrong this patch.
[1:05:24] <$valriot> Bliz3 costing no mana gets me ROCK HARD
[1:05:25] <+JadeKapa> i dont understand, is this minfilia the same one we know or is some timeline fuckery going on?
[1:05:25] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat You've been leveling Ninja. Has "Oracle of Light" pulled off anything unique yet?
[1:05:25] <%CitrusDrink> I bet this'd probably work out faster for levelling DPS when you take queue time into account
[1:05:29] <%THATGUY_789> I've been adding dps moves whilst healing as white mage. cast areo when I have chance
[1:05:29] <+McSnazzyPants> yell at urianger for doing dps and he replies with "you don't pay my sub"
[1:05:30] <Ultimatefool> Holy crap have we come a long way from Warrior only having 10k HP in 2.4...
[1:05:35] <xstormyone> will you always be able to do this or just for story?
[1:05:35] <floatRand> That despair hit made me pp tingle with delight
[1:05:36] <Thorn14> @arcaderabbit48 No she's just NIN
[1:05:42] <Thorn14> She has trick attack which is all we exist for.
[1:05:46] <cizal11> @AngriestPat you see that it doesn't even bother showing you trust mp bars? guess they don't have to worry about that
[1:05:48] <%clempstwitch> this is absolutely gonna be a new insult to bad healers. "Get better than the AI, noob"
[1:05:48] <Hidashi13> this ai is alot better than DCUO allies in raids
[1:05:50] <bestwaifuritsu> and he switches sects after a fight
[1:05:53] <%Ragin_Asian06> Whats your method when running healing using a controller @AngriestPat ?
[1:05:55] <+killer_squid1990> She cast Banish III earlier
[1:05:55] <Calamity2007> @xstormyone Seems just for the story dungeons

[1:06:16] <+MechaBaphomet> YO WADDUP
[1:06:17] <%arcaderabbit48> @Thorn14 Good to know. I was just curious since Alphy gets his own unique flavors of Carbuncle we don't and I dont know if that sticks for the dungeons

[1:07:23] <Whabblet> Lingering Gays
[1:07:28] <Cerabret100> so they can't fail dps check, but probably then kill slower than decent parties, thats absolutely fair
[1:07:28] <Zeetma> Minfillia got a special job rogue while my FC leader got rogue to 70 without getting the job.
[1:07:29] <%CitrusDrink> A pimp cane staff would be a pretty nice glamour actually

[1:22:09] <Viaquez> i'm so glad i put off leveling fisher
[1:22:09] <xeros720> i guess this will make catching specific fish easier?
[1:22:11] <Morsuzado> that will alleviate so much inventory managemant.
[1:22:14] <%CitrusDrink> Does that mean I don't need 300 different kinds of bait taking up all my saddle bag space?!

[1:22:23] <+Grayhammatter> good
[1:22:25] <Mexicanskydiver> crafting is a specialized taste for game play the only reason I got one to 30 is for the emporers new clothes and making prisms

[1:23:27] <Kerozero> I care, EXP buff boy
[1:23:27] <indig0bird> Dang it
[1:23:32] <%Mekhet09> You need to level everything though pat

[1:24:03] <CyborgAV> At least it'll free up 2 cross class slots
[1:24:08] <+Grayhammatter> nice

[1:24:11] <切捨御免> yeah fuck aspects
[1:24:12] <Finakala> A system that was irrelevant anyway
[1:24:15] <xeros720> that's the elemental aspect right?
[1:24:19] <%CitrusDrink> Is that the elemental thing?
[1:24:25] <+darienmask> Yeah Citrus
[1:24:28] <ArkSeaside> and also disappered years ago for all intents and purposes
[1:24:30] <%CitrusDrink> Ah cool
[1:24:45] <fairore> @thesniperjoe how much Kappa
[1:24:46] <Tukaru> Could say it sucks aspects
[1:24:46] <BunnyEmperor> Probably the elementals, brand/name of <element>
[1:24:47] <Neoripo> very useless
[1:24:57] <Aetropos> Ah, so I don't have to worry about understanding it now
[1:25:04] <haisho> this is probably the only time where I can say fuck the poor without looking funny
[1:25:08] <%Solshine11> That’s for crafted primal weapons mostly
[1:25:10] <xeros720> some 2.0 recipes really, it's rather pointless
[1:25:16] <%TheSniperJoe> @fairore 26.50

[1:26:05] <%CitrusDrink> OH it gives you quality predictions!
[1:26:08] <+Moaradin> clean af
[1:26:08] <%CitrusDrink> OH!
[1:26:09] <haveswordmuststing> will we be able to change class while crafting
[1:26:11] <%yeknomlive> progress!
[1:26:13] <+Promessa_EX> that looks like a form
[1:26:15] <haisho> ah dammit condition is still in I'm gonna cry
[1:26:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> spoilers
[1:26:17] <Morsuzado> adjust the exponential increasing difficulty value for recipes
[1:26:17] <%spiritofmojave> Maybe I'll actually give a shit about fully committing
[1:26:25] <$SleepyMaribo> PAY attention, this is important
[1:26:27] <+Akabane101> This is bad ass
[1:26:31] <+TendrilsTwitch> @AngriestPat do you still have that beginner crafting guide? i have no idea where to begin with this shit
[1:26:33] <+Akabane101> I legit want to do crafting again
[1:26:36] <cizal11> the best food for everyone in hw
[1:26:38] <Finakala> Looks good
[1:26:41] <$JojoPiero> I'll probably just stick to gathering and selling raw mats, fuck it
[1:26:45] <cizal11> SO MANY TIMES lmao
[1:26:46] <CyborgAV> I really like how it tells you the progress and quality increases
[1:26:47] <@Pandora_Prime> I made most of my money off of selling those stupid fish.
[1:26:48] <切捨御免> thank GOD
[1:26:52] <%CitrusDrink> Yeah I've done that billions of times
[1:27:03] <%CitrusDrink> Got like 400 HQ orphanage donations
[1:27:04] <BunnyEmperor> lmao when you switch jobs and forgot to turn on collectable mode
[1:27:12] <Neoripo> This is amazing
[1:27:14] <Finakala> Maybe I won't forget to hit Inner Quiet when trying to craft master recipes at last
[1:27:17] <cizal11> showing the exact numbers before you press ANYTHING is so fucking nice
[1:27:24] <Morsuzado> make it so crafting recipes doesn't take 15 damn minutes
[1:27:26] <cizal11> don't need to do 8 decades of math every time you get new gear
[1:27:27] <haisho> oh shit you can see your success rates now
[1:27:28] <MoonObscure> yeee
[1:27:29] <xeros720> definitely saves some effort
[1:27:42] <+darienmask> really more interested in levelling crafter AFTER ShB now
[1:27:44] <Finakala> That increase count is SUPER USEFUL holy shit
[1:27:56] <+smevvster> FFXIV crafting is a god damn monster compared to crafting in any other MMO god damn.
[1:27:58] <r_Foeburden87> Arrows...
[1:28:00] <+TheImmortal70> Finally crafting is less of a pain in the ass
[1:28:04] <Tubit> chevrons
[1:28:10] <%Fidranth> I'm late was there anything before crafting updates?
[1:28:14] <Finakala> Gathering
[1:28:18] <Neoripo> Fuck that
[1:28:22] <Finakala> Also some combat stuff
[1:28:22] <Hiruzen93> this is why i stick to gathering
[1:28:23] <CloudCircus> Why does pat hate Nintendo?
[1:28:25] <%Typhaeon> It is ALMOST as intricate as EverQuest 2
[1:28:27] <Aetropos> which is good, but also daunted to get into
[1:28:35] <r_Foeburden87> Long as it isnt as bad as FFXI
[1:28:37] <haisho> well to be fair, it's probably the only game that makes you do stuff in the process of making shit
[1:28:41] <cizal11> it shows before you even START that's so nice
[1:28:41] <haveswordmuststing> even more than Runescape?
[1:28:45] <%BlancoRico> How long has the Live Letter been going for?
[1:28:48] <haisho> most other games and just press a button and INSTANT ITEM
[1:28:51] <inz0mbiac> I'm still in the free version and I love the crafting version
[1:28:54] <%Divryne> Yes way more than RuneScape.
[1:28:56] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Honestly, I think FF14 skill grind doesnt even come close to the runescape horseshit you have to do
[1:28:57] <@Pandora_Prime> oh boy more math
[1:29:00] <%Typhaeon> Less RNG ye
[1:29:04] <sovayell> 80 CUL PogChamp
[1:29:05] <Finakala> This is real good shit
[1:29:06] <inz0mbiac> but sucks when trying to predict quality change
[1:29:06] <jackythefrost> @haveswordmuststing much more than runescape
[1:29:09] <xeros720> helps the stat increases on gear become less arbitrary too, can see exactly what benefits they have
[1:29:10] <%Vilecrow> Love the crafting on 14
[1:29:11] <%Laecerelius> FFXI's crafting was fucking crazy. The direction you faced helped determine how successful your craft was!
[1:29:12] <+RavenBlackest> pat is a happy boi
[1:29:14] <+smevvster> I mean skill grind is one thing, it's more about what goes into crafting.
[1:29:15] <+Pendlez> hey pat this games pretty good huh
[1:29:21] <%THATGUY_789> @angriestpat is there any one craft that's most beneficial
[1:29:24] <Mexicanskydiver> @angriestpat is it a good idea to get into crafting to get rich quick?
[1:29:26] <haisho> wait what easier HQ items?!
[1:29:27] <Neoripo> Never again guess if you will destroy it
[1:29:29] <Ultimatefool> 75% at base LUL
[1:29:29] <xeros720> sick
[1:29:30] <Finakala> OH SHIT
[1:29:30] <+smevvster> FFXIV isn't Press button -> make item.
[1:29:31] <%CitrusDrink> OOH
[1:29:33] <cizal11> so hq materials will make things WAY easier
[1:29:34] <+Grayhammatter> OH SHIT
[1:29:35] <%Typhaeon> YES.
[1:29:36] <haisho> holy shit that's crazy af
[1:29:38] <CyborgAV> HOLY SHIT
[1:29:38] <%Arnschen> NICE
[1:29:39] <Thorn14> WOW
[1:29:39] <floatRand> Holy shit
[1:29:40] <+SubtleAddict> Oh now they do it, fuckers
[1:29:40] <%Typhaeon> My gatherer will make SO MUCH MONEY
[1:29:41] <xeros720> god, i wish i had that right now
[1:29:42] <sovayell> MADMAN
[1:29:43] <Morsuzado> that helps
[1:29:49] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Divryne) (warning)
[1:29:53] <Monkeyweed21> SO GOOD NERD
[1:29:54] <EvanDude47> "form"
[1:29:55] <xeros720> i've mostly just given up and started buying AH crap to clear quests
[1:29:56] <%Laecerelius> Good thing I'm leveling my gatherers!
[1:29:58] <RamenRiderZ> Nice
[1:30:00] <SweetCuppingCake> that's nice
[1:30:00] <BunnyEmperor> 75% lmao
[1:30:05] <Finakala> Can we please fucking increase HQ mob drop rates please
[1:30:06] <%Divryne> Time to go back to crafting after quitting I GUESS.
[1:30:06] <haisho> I can spend less time on Levequests?!
[1:30:10] <Ultimatefool> You mean I don't have to RNG Hasty x 20 to get to max??!?!
[1:30:10] <Monkeyweed21> is this the ultra nerd part?
[1:30:17] <%CitrusDrink> Make I and II easier they're the real ballaches to get
[1:30:18] <inz0mbiac> this is insane, does that mean the base price of individual HQ ingrediant gets bumped up?
[1:30:24] <RamenRiderZ> Now make potions more useful
[1:30:30] <xeros720> probably, depending
[1:30:35] <BunnyEmperor> It wasnt even hard imo
[1:30:38] <%cTAKU> This is true ENDGAME
[1:30:39] <+EriksBlue> those master books are super easy to get
[1:30:39] <%Laecerelius> If I remember correctly you can buy HQ mob parts using some kind of currency you gain from doing FATES in Shadowbringers
[1:30:40] <%THATGUY_789> is there any craft that's better than the other
[1:30:42] <xeros720> which means hitting those unspoiled nodes gets even more important
[1:30:44] <Monkeyweed21> turbo nerding for big bois
[1:30:46] <Tubit> isn't mahjong the ultra nerd part
[1:30:48] <LordFalara> make potions worth using past level 50 lol
[1:30:55] <ittla> is crafting for crazy people or should everyone try it
[1:30:58] <Aetropos> finally
[1:31:03] <Monkeyweed21> @ittla yes
[1:31:04] <Finakala> Oh shit what
[1:31:06] <haisho> @ittla Doesn't hurt to try it.
[1:31:07] <切捨御免> hobohobo
[1:31:08] <TheNocturnalScotsman> oh yeah the new fate thing
[1:31:09] <%CitrusDrink> It's for crazy people but it's very profitable
[1:31:10] <SweetCuppingCake> god,I forgot about that new fate loot system. It's so good
[1:31:10] <Jolnir> goldsmith class the sickest shit
[1:31:10] <Triforce_of_nerd> crafting can be crazy
[1:31:10] <BunnyEmperor> @ittla for people who get too bored in the end game

[1:31:20] <the_solarflare> so baby player here, every time pat nuts when they show an improvement I'm glad because it's less bullshit I'll never see

[1:31:24] <sneezebits> crafting can get you a lot of money if ya do it right
[1:31:24] <xeros720> all yes
[1:31:26] <Finakala> Wasshoi Wasshoi~
[1:31:26] <+BioHunter> yes
[1:31:27] <MaeMae94> Crafting is what I plan to do for end game
[1:31:30] <cizal11> but also a real good crafting doesn't need any hq materials, so if you're confident, you can get lots more materials, instead of lesser amount of hq materials
[1:31:30] <MiskatonicAlum> @ittla try the Ixali beasttribe crafting
[1:31:31] <srkAres> you can find out if youre crazy! today!
[1:31:32] <Louie_Salmon> Everyone who plays an MMO is a little crazy
[1:31:33] <Morsuzado> mother fucker!
[1:31:34] <Kingdom_65> For crazy people. I dunno if you'll enjoy it though if you play the game for the combat.
[1:31:34] <%Laecerelius> I got my crafting classes to 54 or so in Heavensward and by then I had enough of that
[1:31:36] <+RavenBlackest> yes to what.......yes to crazy people or yes to we shuld try it or both?
[1:31:45] <$OranHexthief> also crafting supposedly has an endgame now
[1:31:45] <+Qits> Yes to yes
[1:31:47] <srkAres> yes
[1:31:47] <Flyrant> both
[1:31:48] <haveswordmuststing> @ravenblackest yes
[1:31:49] <$JojoPiero> "Materia" "NO"
[1:31:50] <cizal11> @Kingdom_65 idk about that, considering it's almost a combat system in itself
[1:31:51] <%THATGUY_789> is there any craft more beneficial than others
[1:31:51] <RadShiro> @RavenBlackest yes
[1:31:51] <+vdalson> @ravenblackest yes
[1:31:52] <Finakala> @Laecerelius Stormblood crafting is way less shitty than Heavensward
[1:31:52] <RamenRiderZ> Crafting can be boring at first but once it gets you it fucking gets you hard
[1:31:54] <%Frodus_Maximus> Frodus_Maximus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:31:57] <xeros720> i'm definitely just burning a few leves on crafting every day

[1:32:32] <kuroi41> @AngriestPat You feel that the easier HQness will make the marketboard a bit more stable? Like HQ food and armor will get a bit cheaper?

[1:47:39] <%weissguard> POTION SELLER
[1:47:39] <Onmi_Khaos> When are we gonna get to the Titanbowl?!
[1:47:39] <Axle13j> but everytime I play I end up dicking around
[1:47:40] <+Deosier> but cheese tho
[1:47:40] <%Solidnick18> what a nerd
[1:47:41] <The_Bob_Guy> I need ONLY the finest of Miqo'te WHORES at my beach palace thanks
[1:47:42] <%Taisuru> The Bacon bread questline made him real good
[1:47:42] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat doing the wine with the homeless guy made me wanna die
[1:47:43] <Thorn14> FREY WAS RIGHT
[1:47:43] <Soliloquy123> his beach cat harem tho
[1:47:43] <unlimited_osteopath> was that Mark Ruffalo??
[1:47:44] <a_c_chirns> He needs Oka Cheese
[1:47:45] <%Solidnick18> look at that nerd
[1:47:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> titan is badtastrophic
[1:47:48] <CountMeowingtonn> y'shtola *
[1:47:50] <Asphy___> some good cheese tho
[1:47:51] <%bluetocho13> Look, not all lalafells are bad
[1:47:52] <Neoripo> The Gegeruju/Champions section was such a drag
[1:47:52] <Stay_Knight> Badass Yoshi P on the chair
[1:47:53] <Monkeyweed21> lalafells deserve to waddle in my farts
[1:47:56] <xeros720> there's still problems, but the story stuff after the base game is a lot better made
[1:47:57] <LordFalara> FANCY CAT
[1:47:59] <%megabrogus> the demo was outside wtf
[1:47:59] <+Ell1ot> how come cheese goblins aren't the main bad guys in FF14?
[1:48:01] <Soiid4Life> the extra 100 quests after a realm reborn is worse
[1:48:02] <%THATGUY_789> I hate that cheese quest
[1:48:06] <Thorn14> Frey was born at that exact moment.
[1:48:10] <Thepothero> and then he marks out at the end the little bastrad
[1:48:10] <jackythefrost> Goblins in XIV are cool
[1:48:14] <wunderkindest> Man, have they ever mentioned the New Game+ stuff since the first Fanfest?
[1:48:14] <%Mekhet09> The wine was the worst.
[1:48:17] <Ashecroft> @AngriestPat Generally anything of "Theres an impending attack/PRIMAL, better spend 3 months ingame faffing about."
[1:48:17] <NotReshi> The only quest I hate more is getting crystal sand for the hw relic
[1:48:18] <Kingdom_65> What do you mean they spent no time on Hrothgar? Cmon pat, they had to model all the fucking pieces of gear.
[1:48:18] <+TheImmortal70> Fray was born when you got a homeless guy wine
[1:48:18] <LordFalara> they spent less time on them for the shitting rabbits
[1:48:19] <%poker4121> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:48:19] <xeros720> there's too many, but there's less nonsense
[1:48:19] <moosemonkey397> what have i missed?
[1:48:22] <%fredbet96> How screwed would a new person be to start this now?
[1:48:24] <%TombstoneTTromboners> XD
[1:48:26] <haisho> speaking of things that suck, oh god the grinding halt at 46 SUCKS ASS
[1:48:28] <DjFrostBite95> rooDab
[1:48:28] <$JojoPiero> Homeless Man is Dalmascan was a cool callback
[1:48:29] <zepelinnn> HE IS FRAY TO ME
[1:48:34] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat How do you think Viera and cat-men-I-can't-remember-the-name will rank in race popularity?
[1:48:37] <Monkeyweed21> Your Self Esteem died then
[1:48:38] <maverickdrifter> FFIX’s a game id need a whole rig for right
[1:48:38] <%BlitzNeidhart> What?
[1:48:39] <+Raidou24> ITS FRAY TO ME DAMMIT
[1:48:39] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat He's literally called Fray in the level 70 quest
[1:48:42] <cizal11> fray is just some random dead dude we know nothing about lol
[1:48:43] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:48:43] <%Finaldragoon> hey look it's that guy who got banned for demanding his chat go dox someone
[1:48:43] <Stay_Knight> Like Self-Esteem, still Fray
[1:48:44] <%BlitzNeidhart> Esteem?
[1:48:45] <%Farples> Cause it's "self-esteem"
[1:48:46] <+McSnazzyPants> best time to start was 1.0
[1:48:47] <%DavidSanChan> it's dad bod pat
[1:48:51] <%Laecerelius> It's actually a really good time to start up since there's so many people playing now
[1:48:52] <Jack_Nightshadow> Esteem the Shadow of the True Self.
[1:48:53] <%Mekhet09> Well he might be if he wants to make money from crafting.
[1:48:54] <Onmi_Khaos> I started less than a month ago and am greatly enjoying myself
[1:48:55] <Thorn14> Hrothgar will be 0
[1:48:56] <Kingdom_65> @haisho I'd say it slows down at 60 tbh, when you have to start doing Heaven-on-High
[1:48:57] <LordFalara> hrothgar will get more play when patches come out that round them out better
[1:48:59] <BunnyEmperor> Throthgar
[1:49:00] <%Taisuru> It;s Fray pat, Esteem is just during the level 60 quest to indicate his true nature
[1:49:02] <snowmanse> Oh, that intern from the sound issue stream is still alive, that's great.
[1:49:03] <Aetropos> LUL
[1:49:04] <Stay_Knight> Nah man furries
[1:49:05] <ittla> @AngriestPat I just recently got to level 50 as DRK, that Fray shit was wack
[1:49:08] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[1:49:09] <+Grayhammatter> dead first
[1:49:12] <a_c_chirns> i fucking knew he was gonna say dead first
[1:49:12] <+DAIROCKETTO> hrothgar would've been second if they had a female version
[1:49:15] <haisho> Yeah but Duty Finder unlocks Aurum Vale at 47
[1:49:17] <%THATGUY_789> I literally started 3 weeks ago and at lvl52.
[1:49:19] <Thorn14> Pat's right
[1:49:19] <haisho> and that sucks ass
[1:49:20] <切捨御免> Esteemien
[1:49:20] <BunnyEmperor> STEAM
[1:49:22] <Mexicanskydiver> @angriestpat how quickly would someone be banned from twitch if someone had third chat completely unmoderated?
[1:49:24] <%gespenst25> Holy shit! What's the dark Knights stand called?!
[1:49:27] <+JohnRSoviet> Estym
[1:49:27] <%THATGUY_789> now*
[1:49:28] <%AnIcedCoffee> nah hrothgar will be more popular than roe just because theyre furry roes
[1:49:28] <+smevvster> Fray's name becomes Esteem when you discover the truth about him during the level 50 job quest.
[1:49:29] <+McSnazzyPants> seriously, "crystal bearer" is the one title i'm eternally buttblasted that i'll never get
[1:49:32] <Thorn14> ONE MORE TIME
[1:49:33] <KatabolicRage> Fray was just a conveniant face for it to use
[1:49:36] <%Niney_Who> Istim
[1:49:37] <RamenRiderZ> Fray Esteem
[1:49:37] <Monkeyweed21> who cares when DRK is WORST TANK
[1:49:38] <%Laecerelius> Hrothgar will be banished to the non-bishie mines along with the Roes
[1:49:40] <Kingdom_65> You think Hrothgar isn't going to have a bunch of furries playing them? I mean I'm playing one but that's cause COOL LION DUDE.
[1:49:41] <+masked_hero_lucky> I'm in the middle of those quests, Pat's right, Fray was the dead Dark Knight you got your crystal from
[1:49:43] <%HiroTSK5> Like "Hope" Estheim?
[1:49:44] <Thorn14> I want the camera to cut to YoshiP just ruthlessly beating the shit out of the Video Guy
[1:49:44] <+smevvster> Fray was the name of the guy who's corpse you robbed for you job crystal.
[1:49:44] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat the lvl 70 DRK quest was pretty cool though
[1:49:46] <Veluren> Hrothgar look great in a lot of armor, I think they'll be more popular than people give credit for
[1:49:49] <Kingdom_65> @Monkeyweed21 DRK isn't worst tank though?
[1:49:50] <Saunt> Wasnt it also called Esteem in the lvl 50 quest
[1:49:51] <PumpkinHolly> apparently the ARR skip is like 7 bucks USD right now lol
[1:49:52] <%THATGUY_789> no self esteem?
[1:49:53] <MoonObscure> yea shut up
[1:49:54] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Monkeyweed21 Fuck off dude
[1:49:54] <%Niney_Who> Baby Pat is MAD

[1:50:21] <%Mekhet09> At least it's not mechanic.
[1:50:23] <Kingdom_65> Yoshi-P takes a deep sigh as he unsheathes his Katana.
[1:50:27] <$valriot> Dark Kmight sucks, Black Mage 15 inch cock
[1:50:29] <+Moaradin> bump that audio
[1:50:30] <+LowBatteryLife> Can we have one stream without Yoshi P having to murder someone over the stream fucking up?
[1:50:31] <WanderingSwordsman> yoshi p back from killing another staff member
[1:50:31] <cizal11> @OnyxMemory given how many dots got killed in SB anyone getting any back is great
[1:50:35] <%THATGUY_789> instant to be the wolf man people
[1:50:39] <LordFalara> hrothgar will get fixed in a few patches, thanks viera, you fucked errythin up again
[1:50:40] <killabubbadawg> hi pat
[1:50:42] <$Garthunox> Yoshi p seems a lot happier

[1:50:55] <Monkeyweed21> but big number tho
[1:50:56] <zepelinnn> @Monkeyweed21 DRK still has the first UwU clear, and the guy said he enjoys the class, EVERYBODEY is capable
[1:50:56] <floatRand> I like dots that are non-interferring
[1:50:59] <Thorn14> can we talk about hwo happy that DRK looks in that art
[1:51:00] <xeros720> almost as potent as pat

[1:51:10] <%Mekhet09> From what i understand mech now has like 52 clicks per minute.
[1:51:11] <NotReshi> When are the adding judge armor to the game? Specifically not locked behind The Feast
[1:51:12] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> Assize is best
[1:51:13] <%AquilaHarukaze> I'm willing to tank my DPS JUST to let the whole animation play out every time.
[1:51:14] <+TheImmortal70> Assize isn't even a DoT

[2:14:47] <BunnyEmperor> Tbf A ranks are en masse
[2:14:49] <MoonObscure> yup
[2:14:53] <Flyrant> Now I can engage S Ranks early and get the whole server mad even easier!

[2:15:05] <RamenRiderZ> Get ready for good ol Hunt salt
[2:15:10] <切捨御免> monkaS
[2:15:20] <DrGasMax> I remember just seeing a SSS Rank Level 60 Behemoth once at like level 57 and being able to do nothing about it
[2:15:40] <ittla> does this mean that hunts are actually accessible now
[2:15:43] <%gespenst25> All s ranks need to be killed twice
[2:15:44] <DrGasMax> "I bet that is super rare... neat I guess."
[2:15:47] <切捨御免> YEAAAH

[2:16:10] <RamenRiderZ> Best game

[2:17:19] <LandOfTheWay> thank god
[2:17:20] <%Typhaeon> Oh good I can fail 50 materia all at once now
[2:17:20] <%GarbageNirvana> It makes no sense but sure yeah
[2:17:22] <%D33TR> i kinda dislike that... some just look so dumb flying
[2:17:22] <zecht89> i can't believe i forgot about this
[2:17:22] <haisho> on one hand, yay everything can fly
[2:17:25] <drakepegasus> even the pabst?
[2:17:25] <%AquilaHarukaze> Finally my lion can FLY!
[2:17:26] <%nmaten> every mount will be dumb like behemoth
[2:17:27] <r_Foeburden87> Wierd but ok
[2:17:27] <Flyrant> just let me fly on my own at this point
[2:17:29] <ashuckel> Flying Cloud Bike
[2:17:29] <TioXyco> magitek armor flying! YES!
[2:17:31] <%Zundelle> FLYING ELEPHANT
[2:17:31] <Alfcrad458> FLYING GOBBUE
[2:17:34] <+king_of_beggars> They should've just made land mounts faster.
[2:17:37] <+enternius> The problem is that there's no point using a mount that doesn't fly anymore
[2:17:40] <haisho> on the other hand, flying Coeurl heart attack!
[2:17:41] <RosELLo6> @TioXyco it can already fly....
[2:17:41] <Gork_N_Mork> That thumbnail already looks awful, but I'm glad its been done.
[2:17:44] <+enternius> So making them all fly is good even if it's dumb
[2:17:45] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I want to see more GOOBUEs
[2:17:48] <Finakala> Most things y'all are saying can already fly
[2:17:48] <%JustAnotherMuffin> Flying Magictek armor.
[2:17:50] <%Kirijuo> The elephant could already fly tho
[2:17:55] <%Typhaeon> SeemsGood
[2:17:58] <%GabeSweetMan> I literally have no idea what 90% of this means but judging by the reactions it sounds like tons of these are massive quality of life improvements for when my brother and I start playing.
[2:17:59] <cizal11> @king_of_beggars they did, riding maps works like that already. problem is when you can fly, what's the point?
[2:18:01] <transporterthesequel> Gacha's do that with enhancing now
[2:18:06] <CyborgAV> Overmelding is such a fuckin' pain
[2:18:06] <+chronopaladin> gimme my disappointment upfront dammit
[2:18:13] <Aetropos> Get the pain all at once
[2:18:15] <%THATGUY_789> no more selling trips over the cap wall
[2:18:15] <SomersaultJustice> !raffle materia
[2:18:15] <%Typhaeon> It's a nega-gatcha system, it's dumb
[2:18:19] <%Typhaeon> as it is now
[2:18:19] <+darienmask> The achievement window needed some major updates
[2:18:20] <TioXyco> @RosELLo6 Oh, I didn't know. I'm still in "2.5 limbo", let's call it
[2:18:24] <%terminallyCapriciousz> wow ty
[2:18:25] <Stay_Knight> This is neat
[2:18:27] <Psyramics> is there some way to make materia that doesn't involve soulbinding? that always seemed like the worst part
[2:18:28] <%doggettxalex> It should be the other way, you can pay in Crysta to speed up the request. pure microtransactions
[2:18:28] <Flyrant> I just started playing again after years. I don't even know how melding works
[2:18:30] <Monkeyweed21> Anti Gacha
[2:18:31] <@SSaryn> That's alright for the people who are achievement hunters
[2:18:32] <omega_reddu> The light theme is garish
[2:18:35] <@Pandora_Prime> But pat the focused totality of your materia loss all at once would kill you.
[2:18:42] <Finakala> Ooh, tracking is good
[2:18:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Now you can just care about the ones that get you stuff
[2:18:42] <Aetropos> finally I can see the title achievements, which is all i ever actually want
[2:18:45] <KatabolicRage> someone asked for this I think
[2:18:46] <Aetropos> TRACKER?
[2:18:48] <%Kirijuo> If material stays as easy to get it’s not that bad
[2:18:49] <Monkeyweed21> thas gud
[2:18:54] <+darienmask> We can only track 5 quests but 30 achievements?
[2:18:58] <%Kirijuo> They’re all like 5k now
[2:19:08] <KatabolicRage> wanna track challenge logs though
[2:19:08] <%spiritofmojave> they really are going all out on QoL
[2:19:13] <%TheSniperJoe> Quality of LIfe Bringers
[2:19:16] <@SSaryn> Itll matter for the mount hunters to be fair.
[2:19:17] <Finakala> There's probably like 30 that actually give something nice so that's good
[2:19:21] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Only 639 enemies
[2:19:22] <$valriot> Thatll help for Tank mounts
[2:19:25] <+PharosOfLight> @darienmask it seems to be a seperate page inside the achievements, like the wishlist on the marketboard
[2:19:25] <Aetropos> if only challenge logs were relevant again FeelsBadMan
[2:19:33] <%QuadraticGravity> PogChamp?
[2:19:34] <+darienmask> Yeah, that makes sense Pharos
[2:19:35] <+Grayhammatter> oh good
[2:19:36] <KatabolicRage> amazing, too many mentors use that crown as a dunce cap
[2:19:38] <%Arnschen> Good
[2:19:38] <floatRand> Oh goodie
[2:19:38] <unlimited_osteopath> Oh no! my Burger King crown???
[2:19:38] <%spiritofmojave> nice
[2:19:39] <jackythefrost> ALL MENTORS BANNED
[2:19:41] <%doggettxalex> anyone can be mentor now, let there be chaos
[2:19:50] <+darienmask> That's a shame, most mentors are terrible
[2:19:52] <floatRand> Hopefully pieces of lose status
[2:19:55] <floatRand> shite
[2:19:56] <KatabolicRage> it needs to be HARDER to get
[2:20:01] <unlimited_osteopath> that's a lot of mentors, though
[2:20:03] <%spiritofmojave> Make mentor hour based and watch the calamity
[2:20:06] <Gork_N_Mork> Change the crown to a poop emoji.
[2:20:06] <proudlydrowsy> They need to replace the crown tbh
[2:20:16] <%D33TR> every mentor i've ever met has been terrible
[2:20:17] <BunnyEmperor> I hope it will be tremendously hard to get that status, all those fake mentors ruin the system
[2:20:17] <+darienmask> Yes, that's good
[2:20:17] <Finakala> Ooh, good
[2:20:19] <%Kirijuo> Mentor status literally means nothing
[2:20:20] <%Arnschen> Oh, that's really good
[2:20:21] <+Grayhammatter> that's good
[2:20:24] <Aetropos> Oh so they have a timer to reinstate themselves
[2:20:27] <%GabeSweetMan> That's hot
[2:20:29] <%doggettxalex> replace crown with cock n balls
[2:20:30] <BunnyEmperor> Real mentors never put a crown on because of fakes
[2:20:33] <%Divryne> Mentors are assholes. LUL
[2:20:34] <RamenRiderZ> RIP Burger King Crown
[2:20:34] <unlimited_osteopath> wtf are these licensing exams?
[2:20:36] <%orihsnek> sounds fair to me
[2:20:40] <+McSnazzyPants> the problem with mentor status is that it's a fucking crown
[2:20:40] <%cTAKU> It's official a learners permit
[2:20:41] <%spiritofmojave> good stuff
[2:20:42] <+TheImmortal70> Take your fuckin exams
[2:20:42] <NotReshi> Not like I've seen those burger-king crowns do anything but this is nice
[2:20:45] <+McSnazzyPants> no good could've come from that
[2:20:46] <cizal11> it won't be enough tbh
[2:20:47] <Basch71> mentors, not even once LuL
[2:20:49] <Stay_Knight> Lol this is like real life shit
[2:20:51] <Tubit> there's a mentor standard?
[2:20:53] <+TheImmortal70> You better be good at your JOBB
[2:20:56] <cizal11> mentors will always be shit no matter how many classes they level
[2:20:57] <CyborgAV> I never have my Mentor status on because Mentors are so bad
[2:20:59] <%spiritofmojave> 14 DMV when
[2:21:02] <%KnightReis> i only put on my crafter mentor hat because no one will have to ask me how to hit things
[2:21:10] <%Typhaeon> 100 Collectables? Pssshhhh
[2:21:11] <@SSaryn> Yeah ok. That seems fine.
[2:21:13] <unlimited_osteopath> I already meet all requirements.
[2:21:13] <proudlydrowsy> 300 Player Commendations LUL
[2:21:16] <BunnyEmperor> FailFish this is shit easy
[2:21:16] <Finakala> Those trade ones are easy what
[2:21:20] <+jaytrident> doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp doodGood
[2:21:21] <%QuadraticGravity> Literally just upping it to 80
[2:21:27] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[2:21:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:29] <Thepothero> Hahahahaha
[2:21:30] <+darienmask> I need like 50 more comms and I'm a noob, they need higher requirements
[2:21:30] <%CitrusDrink> So, the same just with the level cap raised
[2:21:30] <%orihsnek> oh damn i thought it'd be harder
[2:21:32] <floatRand> Well lmao
[2:21:34] <%Typhaeon> Agreed
[2:21:35] <Kerozero> Oh so I just needa do a Tank and SMN and I'm a mentor still Kappa
[2:21:35] <CyborgAV> Mentors still garbage confirmed
[2:21:36] <r_Foeburden87> just ned arcanist and a tank job
[2:21:36] <BunnyEmperor> Also 300 commendations only? LULW
[2:21:37] <Aetropos> so it's just upgrading the level to 80 FailFish
[2:21:39] <transporterthesequel> I had those req's like, TWO YEARS AGO
[2:21:39] <Thepothero> i keep my crown
[2:21:41] <jackythefrost> I have over 1000 commendations...
[2:21:41] <%Mekhet09> That seems excessive.
[2:21:45] <BinaryShuffle> Those are some laughable requirements If i nearly qualify
[2:21:53] <%KnightReis> yeaah so when you see a crafter crown you know you can get melds from me
[2:21:54] <%QuadraticGravity> Up it to 500 commends tbh
[2:21:58] <%spiritofmojave> that trade one seems extraordinarily lean
[2:21:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@zecht89) (warning)
[2:22:00] <%THATGUY_789> I saw a mentor. he lead me to my death
[2:22:03] <+chemtrailsgaming> 300 commends takes a while
[2:22:05] <BunnyEmperor> So basically everyone is a mentor by 80
[2:22:05] <Tubit> it took me like a couple of weeks to get 300
[2:22:06] <+EriksBlue> I have 1300 coms
[2:22:09] <%Arnschen> These ones are very basic
[2:22:09] <MaeMae94> I'm a new player and I could get that easy
[2:22:11] <%Ascethetic> im good with comms
[2:22:11] <KatabolicRage> mentors need to be good at ALL aspects of that role
[2:22:12] <RamenRiderZ> Just max Tank and Summoner 4Head
[2:22:16] <%orihsnek> problem is that you get both crowns
[2:22:17] <%Typhaeon> It will remain the Burger King Crown
[2:22:19] <%orihsnek> split that shit down the middle
[2:22:21] <$SleepyMaribo> im like 700 comm's deep
[2:22:22] <%GarbageNirvana> All mentoring seems to require is that you've played for long enough
[2:22:23] <%gespenst25> I've got like 5k commendations when will we have something to do with them?
[2:22:25] <unlimited_osteopath> Should've made it so you needed to have completed Ultimate Ultima or Unending Coil to obtain :]
[2:22:26] <+darienmask> I appreciate that it's ALL the level 80 quest types, at leaset
[2:22:27] <%Mekhet09> That's true but there are people who max everything who have no idea how to help other people.
[2:22:28] <%orihsnek> unless you qualify for both
[2:22:28] <Aetropos> I literally only am missing the 1000s stuff cuz i havent done that many yet
[2:22:29] <$SleepyMaribo> just be a tank or healer and you get them no prob
[2:22:29] <KatabolicRage> too many mentors do not help new players, they just dickwave with the crown and it turns into a dunce cap, people groan when they see the mentor icon in a dungeon
[2:22:30] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what r mentors?
[2:22:33] <Monkeyweed21> Should require doing main scenario roulette 100 times
[2:22:35] <SomersaultJustice> id rather be a mantaur
[2:22:37] <crazyer> mentorship is so easy to get its pretty much meaningless right now
[2:22:41] <cizal11> @gespenst25 you get mounts right
[2:22:41] <ashuckel> the only factor is getting the commendations, wich will only take a while if you play a DPS, coz fuck DPS coms
[2:22:46] <%shawntk_> Aurion Pax has logged on
[2:22:52] <proudlydrowsy> i've only been playing for a year and i have over 2000 commends qneYikes
[2:22:56] <HibikiYamada> lots of trade/gatherer mentors will be culled now.
[2:23:00] <%doggettxalex> only people who kill ulti bahumut get mentor
[2:23:02] <BunnyEmperor> This needs to be way harder to get, but they will hear that feedback again
[2:23:05] <DrGasMax> Anyone who plays this game regularly will have met this qualifications, I have only been playing the game again for a month and a half and I am like half way on this
[2:23:06] <%Kirijuo> It’s stupid because you can just spam Ifrit hard with a level 80 and get those 1000 in like 3 hours
[2:23:06] <+chemtrailsgaming> All tanks and healers are now mentors lol
[2:23:08] <Aetropos> There should be like a test you have to complete to become a mentor, to prove you know what you're talking about
[2:23:10] <RadShiro> what even IS a Trade Mentor????
[2:23:10] <hometownman> @ashuckel i always commend dps when i play tank or healer
[2:23:15] <Finakala> You need to play Aurum Vale 3 times back to back as each role without dying
[2:23:24] <Nordguy> I started like 20 days and i got like 50, that's way too low a requirement
[2:23:27] <NotReshi> the only time I've gotten comms as a dps is when I'm the last one alive and finish off a boss
[2:23:31] <Monkeyweed21> I just need to level 1 tank class to qualify
[2:23:35] <+PharosOfLight> Are mentors on other servers really that bad? Levi is usually helpful
[2:23:35] <HibikiYamada> @RadShiro crafters mentoring new crafters.
[2:23:39] <BunnyEmperor> @RadShiro literally only an icon lmao
[2:23:39] <+darienmask> I usually comm dps, because they never get the
[2:23:41] <Finakala> I get comms semi-regularly as BRD
[2:23:43] <+JackDemon316> Hay guys did anyone get the steam codes from the heavensward giveaway? im still waiting for mine.
[2:23:45] <%doggettxalex> kuso
[2:23:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> What about the duty recorder?
[2:23:47] <ashuckel> one of the two/four dps avaiable, meanwhile the tank/healer almost always get coms
[2:23:49] <%shawntk_> @Finakala At that point just get rid of the mentor system
[2:23:52] <haisho> oooh wat dis
[2:23:52] <Fuji_Apples> kusa
[2:23:52] <jackythefrost> New Eureka?
[2:23:53] <Finakala> Maybe because tanks actually like Pallisade, but RIP Pallisade
[2:23:54] <$JojoPiero> Heal for 3 Sprouts in AV, Synced, and you gotta be hooked up to show you never got angry
[2:23:54] <%spiritofmojave> Heaven on High follow up?
[2:23:54] <%ArcanumMBD> Eureka 2.0
[2:23:54] <%Kirijuo> It should require that you meet the requirements for mentor roulette to get mentor status
[2:23:55] <+darienmask> We went from a log to a stick
[2:23:56] <%doggettxalex> oh it's new eureka
[2:23:56] <+masked_hero_lucky> This looks...important
[2:23:57] <NotReshi> pls no
[2:23:59] <+chemtrailsgaming> Eden is the new Omega
[2:24:01] <cizal11> eden is the new raid dude
[2:24:01] <NotReshi> no more Eureka
[2:24:02] <+EatinEden> huh
[2:24:06] <$JojoPiero> Eden is Raid
[2:24:09] <$doctor_piranha> please no eureka...
[2:24:10] <cizal11> also eureka was great
[2:24:12] <%Fidranth> NIER?
[2:24:12] <zamzoph> Is this a Dark Souls zone?
[2:24:17] <%doggettxalex> nier is 24 man
[2:24:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Glory to mankind?
[2:24:21] <00raln00> the nomura raid :O
[2:24:21] <$JojoPiero> This is Anor Londo
[2:24:21] <zepelinnn> this is FF8
[2:24:24] <zepelinnn> FF8 rid
[2:24:27] <CyborgAV> My buddy has straight up saved entire runs as a RDM and still not gotten any comms.
[2:24:35] <%THATGUY_789> @jackdemon316 I just went to square account
[2:24:36] <BunnyEmperor> Looks almost like The Burn
[2:24:42] <r_Foeburden87> Nier is the next after ST > VA > Rabanastre
[2:24:43] <%HiroTSK5> I stoked for FFVIII remastered
[2:24:45] <AndySoryu> theres probably some huge MSQ spoilers there
[2:24:49] <+mik255> i never expected an FF8 raid
[2:24:58] <%orihsnek> deeps commend deeps, or at least i do
[2:24:59] <%radda343> how to get comms: 1) be a tank or a healer 2) don't be not a tank or a healer
[2:25:00] <%Fidranth> oasis in the middle of the burn maybe?
[2:25:03] <jackythefrost> @CyborgAV DPS never get comms. Tanks always get them cause they are at the top of the list
[2:25:04] <Monkeyweed21> fight Alphinaud's corpse or some shit
[2:25:05] <+JackDemon316> @THATGUY_789 nvm i just got the email lol thx
[2:25:08] <zecht89> Ultimecia's Castle maybe?
[2:25:08] <cizal11> it's not an ff8 raid. gonna be heavily related to the main story, but eden the summon will probably factor into it
[2:25:10] <$JojoPiero> I thought Triple Triad was the only gameplay in 8?
[2:25:12] <Tubit> play lower level stuff and you get more comms
[2:25:15] <zamzoph> @AndySoryu you mean MGQ? Kappa
[2:25:19] <%THATGUY_789> @jackdemon316 all good
[2:25:19] <%Kirijuo> Eden is in the first
[2:25:25] <%KnightReis> sort of wanted an ff8 remaster that looks more polished up, not to ff7re levels but somewhere more than it is
[2:25:26] <Aetropos> monkaS MSQ affects environments
[2:25:27] <AndySoryu> oh nvm then
[2:25:33] <+darienmask> That's alright then
[2:25:33] <Monkeyweed21> video broke?
[2:25:39] <floatRand> Trailer?
[2:25:41] <unlimited_osteopath> there is no video
[2:25:41] <%Divryne> MSQ makes night return probably.
[2:25:45] <%doggettxalex> Instanced areas? what is this, WoW
[2:25:51] <%bluetocho13> MSQ affects enviroments Pog
[2:26:06] <CyborgAV> @jackythefrost Oh, I'm well aware, I'm just pointing out to the uninitiated how bad it really is.
[2:26:06] <+TheImmortal70> There's instanced areas because HOLY SHIT is there a lot of players
[2:26:08] <Monkeyweed21> element of dabbing
[2:26:13] <Finakala> MSQ has had minor effects before
[2:26:15] <jcflyguy> Is this spoilers
[2:26:17] <%Stonebeard> Gotta plant that SeeD
[2:26:20] <+Grayhammatter> jesus

[2:26:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> Wooloo?
[2:26:33] <%Kirijuo> This isn’t really a surprise, a lot of side activities affect the environment

[2:27:42] <unlimited_osteopath> you are correct, FF8 is indeed THE WORST FF.
[2:27:45] <%TheSniperJoe> I've beaten ff8 like 20 times and I don't know what that is...
[2:27:46] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah sure no idea
[2:27:46] <%Ascethetic> @ssaryn beat it 20 years ago
[2:27:47] <jackythefrost> Gotta drag it out pat
[2:27:48] <IminyourBase> Death Stranding
[2:27:48] <Onmi_Khaos> It's the Eden Guardian Force
[2:27:54] <fizuth> FF2 is the worst FF, don't lie
[2:27:56] <Noctis_Fatehart> It's the top of Eden's head for sure
[2:27:57] <%Yadogari> Water it LUL
[2:27:57] <Stay_Knight> Lolol these shitlords
[2:27:58] <DrGasMax> eh, original FF2 is the worst
[2:27:58] <%radda343> ff8 gameplay was bad, but the story and aesthetic were great imo
[2:27:58] <proudlydrowsy> just go over there qneWhy
[2:27:59] <ashuckel> fell out of yoshi p pocket
[2:27:59] <+kaosslayer> make some dirt LUL

[2:28:05] <%JustAnotherMuffin> GO mathsquadWizard
[2:28:07] <%doggettxalex> who are these people not saying 13-2 is not the worst
[2:28:09] <%QuadraticGravity> @TheSniperJoe you can only get Eden from like two superbosses I think, it's the ultimate summon
[2:28:11] <%spiritofmojave> Gardnerer class jermaVenus
[2:28:11] <unlimited_osteopath> is it literally just Eden from FFVIII?
[2:28:13] <haisho> that is one dead primal
[2:28:14] <%cTAKU> apatSleep
[2:28:18] <BunnyEmperor> Fucking teased
[2:28:19] <Stay_Knight> But FF2 has the Emperor though
[2:28:20] <jackythefrost> @unlimited_osteopath FF2 is unanimously considered the worst
[2:28:24] <MaeMae94> This is the garden they talked about before!
[2:28:25] <Kerozero> FF2 is the worst FF
[2:28:26] <+PharosOfLight> It's a Fal'cie

[2:28:34] <%spiritofmojave> apatSleep
[2:28:36] <%TheSniperJoe> @QuadraticGravity Am I just looking at it from the wrong angle? Other than the feathers I don't see Eden, I just see...a mass of white.

[2:28:38] <Finakala> All the Bravest is worst FF obviousl
[2:28:38] <ashuckel> this looks like the easiest landscape to design
[2:28:40] <DrGasMax> Isn't FF8 the one with the story where the big twist is that all the character grew up together in the same house and the main villain was the caretaker, and they all just forgot?
[2:28:40] <$doctor_piranha> ff8 story was fuckin dumb and so contrived (they all had amnesia and happened to grow up in the same orphanage)
[2:28:44] <Monkeyweed21> rise up like a gamer
[2:28:45] <RamenRiderZ> boo cowards
[2:28:48] <+Tenshino> FF2 and 13-3 are the worsttt

[2:53:01] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat Pat, did you know that it's official that the lala healer of the group has a huge crush on Arbert? It was in one of the lorebooks
[2:53:05] <raimsurion> Cool and dead arent mutually exclusive

[2:54:09] <%Divryne> Moon in 7.0.
[2:54:10] <buddy0993> one theory is that the moon is zodiark

[2:54:11] <Finakala> 7.0 Moon incoming

[2:54:17] <NotReshi> I thought the moon was the corse of Zodiark
[2:54:18] <BunnyEmperor> The Moon will crash onto the planet, causing the next calamity

[2:54:46] <bestwaifuritsu> bahamut zero fight on the moon when
[2:54:46] <DrGasMax> The Acians are the main villains of FFXIV and they are also the worst, which is my most of the focus is on different better villains
[2:54:47] <%TombstoneTTromboners> bahamut was in the second moon
[2:54:49] <unlimited_osteopath> Bahamut was hanging out INSIDE a different, fake moon.
[2:54:51] <%miguelrod777> my birf day
[2:54:53] <%TombstoneTTromboners> now there's just one moon
[2:54:54] <Aetropos> maybe for now spoils are safe monkaS

[2:55:35] <%AquilaHarukaze> Raubahn 2.0 is going to be the DNC trainer.
[2:55:35] <SweetCuppingCake> I hope this expansion doesn't start like how Stormblood did
[2:55:35] <Morsuzado> I'm reluctant to preorder again after stormblood.
[2:55:35] <jackythefrost> Raubahn Savage Extreme

[2:57:50] <%Fenrirlives> @mothmandraws Hey Moth!
[2:57:50] <sjcodan> MASH BUTTON
[2:57:59] <@mothmandraws> ppl said titan waould be slog but wasnt that bad
[2:58:11] <+TheImmortal70> Okay enjoy 100 quests of intrigue before heavens
[2:58:12] <damienlunas> I beat Raubahn Savage Pre-Nerf
[2:58:12] <+darienmask> Titan slog is nothing compared to PostARR slog
[2:58:16] <@mothmandraws> ill just do a no life long stream
[2:58:17] <BappoSama> I'm sorry I'm late..
[2:58:21] <cizal11> if you didnt' find titan that bad then you'll probably be fine with the rest
[2:58:26] <BappoSama> Did I miss anything important?
[2:58:26] <cizal11> but it is real long
[2:58:27] <DrGasMax> ARR isn't a slog, ARR Post Game is the slog
[2:58:27] <+darienmask> But it is worth it
[2:58:29] <+Deosier> i'm on the post ARR slog and boy is it a slog
[2:58:31] <jackythefrost> Man getting Cronus Lux is a pain in the ass but its worth it
[2:58:38] <%bluetocho13> bluetocho13 gifted a Tier 1 sub to mothmandraws! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:58:40] <MaeMae94> @mothmandraws I just finished the slog, it's bad but doable. But holy hell it lasts a looooong time
[2:58:44] <@mothmandraws> ty bluetocho
[2:58:46] <%JustAnotherMuffin> @darienmask At least the PostARR stuff is interesting
[2:58:52] <%JGardner88> Mister Angry Pat, can we expect a non stop stream of ShadowBringers
[2:58:52] <+darienmask> More so than a Banquest
[2:58:53] <+smevvster> @BappoSama Not really? Mostly just Quality of life changes and Crafter/Gatherer stuff, but what you missed is too much to sumarize in a twitch chat
[2:58:54] <TioXyco> @Deosier agreed
[2:58:54] <%JGardner88> Kappa
[2:59:01] <DrGasMax> Remember the quest line where Tataru quits that plays out exactly like a filler episode of an anime?
[2:59:02] <+Dosudude> @jackythefrost Doing the same atm, on the light farming step
