[0:33:48] <%chronotriggerhappy123> the same as any other centaur Paige!
[0:33:49] <mrjplays2k9> a disabled centaur
[0:33:50] <scrumbotime> Fairy Tale Creamtures
[0:33:50] <%threecheats> In DnD a centuar is a medium sized creature and can carry medium sized creatures so you can build a tower of centaurs that move at normal speed
[0:33:51] <%UvBenServed> PROBABLY?
[0:33:51] <%SvenHolgersson> WHATS THE
[0:33:51] <%colouroftheiris77> Paige... Google a Centaur
[0:33:52] <+Skaphel> Paige is scared of CENTIPEDE CENTAURS
[0:33:54] <%DukeMoose> how long until paige cheats in the race and makes centaur man break his leg?
[0:33:55] <iamnuff> Listen, he stepped on a landmine, don't make fun of him.

[0:34:04] <@SoFarFetched> If the Dick's hard enough
[0:34:04] <joniroquai> Paige open to the idea of crippling centaurs confirmed
[0:34:04] <ThorgrimFunhammer> heyo
[0:34:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why would it be odd?
[0:34:06] <Orenjevel> question: does paige have a tiny kart to race against the centaur
[0:34:07] <+lethallunacyx> What fictional horses don't have 4 legs ffs?
[0:34:07] <Sp3ctre48> That certainly is an image Keepo
[0:34:07] <wibbwobbler> dat 5th leg tho
[0:34:09] <%TheShal> What if it's Slepnier? And it has 8 legs?
[0:34:10] <@SSaryn> There's probably a stupid Centaur design with a penis for a leg
[0:34:10] <%skelechief> paige would you prefer a mermaid man that's human from the waist up or would you rather have a mermaid man that's human from the waist down
[0:34:11] <Truinz25> Is paige saying she can beat a crippled centaur in a race? and is proud of it ???
[0:34:15] <@SoFarFetched> Make him do Dick Push Ups
[0:34:16] <%spongeofmystery> What if it's Sleipnir, Odin's 8 legged horse?
[0:34:16] <mrjplays2k9> LUL
[0:34:17] <+captainpodock> Did she think the top half of the centaur was horse and the bottom was human?
[0:34:17] <Herb_guy> Maybe Patts natural sent is weed for Paige
[0:34:19] <madskull456> pat receives a speed buff

[0:34:35] <%chronotriggerhappy123> to be fair Odin's horse had 6 legs
[0:34:38] <%TomFrancis_> a 100 legged centaur, a centaurpede

[0:48:27] <Mysterydewd> an important distinction; sheep are the dumbest things alive, but goats are stupidly smart.

[0:49:41] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Pat, you okay?
[0:49:43] <+Calern> is anyone genuinely, unironically defensing the bad framerate or is it just foir the meme?

[0:49:45] <ChocolateMoofin> cottonee is a dope Pokemon tho
[0:49:46] <Coystick> FOUR human legs
[0:49:46] <%DukeMoose> A REVERSE SIMPTAUR
[0:49:51] <scrumbotime> That Is Bad
[0:49:51] <%Pyroclase> That's a minotaur though
[0:49:53] <%depressed_skeleton> no
[0:49:54] <%DKDiamantes> Thats a nightmare inducing image
[0:49:55] <%fingalights> Not well
[0:49:58] <%BinaryFireball> omg pat
[0:50:00] <%depressed_skeleton> unless its legs are huge
[0:50:01] <%Piemen99> horror
[0:50:02] <%1matheuw> so a minotaur?
[0:50:02] <+greatgetter> A Minotaur then?
[0:50:02] <%rosabellamelantha> Bojack
[0:50:03] <$Grimlockfly> that's a minotaur
[0:50:03] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Yeah, Sorry to Bother You shows it's fine
[0:50:03] <DianaTheAscian> wouldn't that just fall 9over?
[0:50:03] <%Taisuru> Minotaur pat
[0:50:04] <ChocolateMoofin> I still recommend you hydrate pat. plz
[0:50:04] <%Piemono> Would it be able to fuck?
[0:50:05] <AmericanaRed> horse man
[0:50:06] <%afronooch> a minotaur?
[0:50:07] <InvisibleMan101> like Bojack
[0:50:07] <%VioletHeart> @PatStaresAt Isn't a reverse centaur kind of a minotaur?
[0:50:09] <madskull456> maybe theyd have to crawl
[0:50:09] <Diablo169> If it's got a human dick is there any real point?
[0:50:11] <%Fien111> Hoars
[0:50:11] <%fingalights> What is the top of a horse
[0:50:12] <Streetshark_> then whats a horse bottom
[0:50:13] <%Frost_Quill> That's a horse version of a minotaur.
[0:50:15] <Coystick> No, no. Four Human Legs in Centaur configuration
[0:50:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> I think it's BULLSHIT that Joe Camel has no humps
[0:50:18] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[0:50:21] <+Skaphel> a reverse centaur would be a horsehead and DIRECTLY under a waist down of human
[0:50:22] <iamnuff> Swery has never made a good game. It's going to be a trashfire, I don't know why Pat finds it endearing. Stockholm syndrome?
[0:50:22] <Psyramics> Where is the waist of the horse?
[0:50:22] <+MoroseLoki> Bojack Horseman lmao
[0:50:22] <@SoFarFetched> A horse is a horse,of course of course.
[0:50:22] <%dekkitout> Does Beastars not have a Deer guy?
[0:50:23] <Herb_guy> don't judge reverse centaurs life style
[0:50:24] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt the horses waist ends at it's neck
[0:50:26] <lilredmage> reverse minotaur sounds horrible
[0:50:27] <%miguelrod777> it's be a minotaur
[0:50:31] <%dekkitout> Cause deer are basically horses
[0:50:36] <%1matheuw> a minotaur but horse instead is ox
[0:50:38] <Streetshark_> it is so late
[0:50:40] <%Frost_Quill> "Do horses have arms?" Paige Mustard 2020
[0:50:40] <Streetshark_> so late
[0:50:42] <Mrbaconator> "does a horse have arms?"
[0:50:44] <%KaiserMario> A reverse centaur would be a horse head with legs
[0:50:44] <+Calern> do you apply that logic to satyrs too?
[0:50:46] <%depressed_skeleton> what
[0:50:47] <%fingalights> This is true

[0:56:20] <+Namboto> houndsHonk
[0:56:20] <Finakala> I'm pretty sure 90% of deaths are horses tripping in races

[1:05:51] <thelonechris> It's very colorful
[1:05:52] <Saltmeisterr> is it just melee quake?
[1:06:06] <+thesyndrome> select on controller maybe?
[1:06:07] <Finakala> You ain't seen shit yet, Arcane Expanse chapter is probably the best new-boomer shooter chapter on the market for aesthetics
[1:06:07] <geassguy360> the mix of modern lighting and complex design with low rez pixely textures is super cool
[1:06:13] <TioXyco> this is "not hexen"
[1:06:14] <%moogleboy1984> @Saltmeisterr it's Heretic
[1:06:16] <+BobBaudoin> wheress the baaaaaaby
[1:06:22] <narthole> fun fact, all the weapons in this game are sprites
[1:06:24] <%GarbageNirvana> I will say I'm a fan of retro aesthetics if only because I want more games to focus on solid gameplay instead of pushing your GPU to its limits
[1:06:25] <%rosabellamelantha> this game is NOT designed for controller

[1:07:14] <Coystick> They're lightmapped
[1:07:16] <%StooEsq> There's a whole writeup about how the weapons were 3D but turned into 2D sprites
[1:07:16] <geassguy360> its a real gud pistol tho
[1:07:20] <%BinaryFireball> pre rendered goodness
[1:07:29] <geassguy360> yeee
[1:07:30] <+thesyndrome> honestly, don't consider it a pistol, it's still really useful even in the late game
[1:07:42] <%StooEsq> it's real good for a starting weapon
[1:07:50] <%GarbageNirvana> The lighting on them is impressive
[1:07:51] <thelonechris> Can you put a laser dot sight on it?
[1:07:52] <dauver> 33

[1:10:25] <%Starotter70> COWARD
[1:10:27] <broostmonkey> sure baby
[1:10:27] <Saltmeisterr> @moogleboy1984 well what is Heretic?
[1:10:31] <+thesyndrome> so basically you are playing on controller to be a contrarian?
[1:10:31] <set29> I did it
[1:10:36] <geassguy360> ive played csgo on controller lol
[1:10:36] <Finakala> Pat go play Dawn of War on controller I dare you

[1:10:39] <%1matheuw> YOU CAN PLAY WILDRIFT HO
[1:10:44] <Frogwash> You can play smite with a controller
[1:10:44] <+PortableBoredom> Why is anyone acting like controller isn't the correct way to play literally any video game
[1:10:46] <%moogleboy1984> Heretic is the prequel to HeXen
[1:10:47] <+Jiziason> steam controller tho
[1:10:48] <set29> CSGO on controller is ez
[1:10:56] <%Taisuru> @thesyndrome Pat would NEVER be contrarian!
[1:10:59] <RunningNGunning> Play Arma 3 on a controller coward
[1:11:00] <SickBowelMovesBro> i love you for that, Pat
[1:11:01] <cipher758> pro gamer pat
[1:11:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Dwarf Fortress with a controller
[1:11:02] <+BoboDaHobo> he's a controlarion
[1:11:03] <%StooEsq> controller playthrough of Descent
[1:11:03] <geassguy360> dawn of war 2 actually works fine on a controller via steam
[1:11:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Controller>Keyboard and Mouse
[1:11:04] <+kirby_lonestar> But BoxBox already has played League of Legends with a controller
[1:11:05] <Aydarkzero> does csgo on controller give aa?
[1:11:09] <MafiaTweek> until Pat uses Woolie's pulley contraption to play video games i'm not impressed
[1:11:11] <+toastybites> Play CSGO on Wii nunchucks
[1:11:18] <Finakala> Heretic is Hexen without the obtuse puzzles that nobody would ever understand
[1:11:20] <%thegreenbenis> Because you are playing baby mode
[1:11:23] <%TheShal> Pat seems to be having a hard time aiming. Maybe if he had some sort of pointing device it'd be easier for him.
[1:11:27] <%Fien111> Pat, Out of curiosity, did you ever like space sims back in the day like Wing Commander and Freespace?
[1:11:31] <%dasmause> remember that the axe remains valid and powerful weapon throughout the game. it also teleports enemies toward you from short distances
[1:11:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> PLAY MAVIS BEACON TEACHES TYPING ON A CONTROLLER
[1:11:46] <+WupingFosters> the controller talk has reminded me of the Shadowrun FPS that had console and PC crossplay
[1:11:50] <%rosabellamelantha> Axe is AMAZING
[1:11:50] <geassguy360> yeah i have never beaten hexen, heretic is timeless tho
[1:11:51] <%moogleboy1984> If you line up the reticle, yeah
[1:11:51] <Coystick> Y'know, the classic axe move
[1:11:52] <+thesyndrome> @dasmause yeah axe is amazing
[1:11:53] <+Arkfyre> If only there was a way to move your cursor directly over the enemy hmmmm
[1:11:59] <%dekkitout> So reverse melee lunge?
[1:11:59] <+abrupt_abe> Superhot sequel/new game out July 16
[1:12:02] <Orenjevel> Magic Axe

[1:12:29] <%dekkitout> "Kiss my axe"
[1:12:30] <%Fien111> Better combat than Elder Scrolls, your move Todd Coward
[1:12:30] <Finakala> Soulmode Axe deletes most things
[1:12:31] <ape_hawk> pat, why are you such a bitch about M+KB?
[1:12:31] <Herb_guy> Its a Axs kicker
[1:12:33] <+greatgetter> Soul mode the Axe!
[1:12:35] <%StooEsq> Axe is funnier with Soul Power
[1:12:35] <+Javaa01> Get the buffed version of the axe
[1:12:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> iS hexen the one where you fight cultists who scream at you in latin?
[1:12:43] <geassguy360> its on par IMO
[1:12:44] <%indig0bird> ZA HAAAANDO
[1:12:45] <Aydarkzero> looks cool
[1:12:45] <KnightAsteran> hey, does anyone know a way to stop DUSK from making me motion sick cause i want to play it but i really cant
[1:12:46] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt even on EVIL difficulty the axe kills low level enemies in like 1 to 2 hits it's so good
[1:12:47] <%dasmause> also use axe's soul mode in water for an achievment
[1:12:47] <%fairore> @fien111 lmao
[1:12:52] <%PaladinDupre> Controller playthrough of DOS2 When
[1:12:53] <geassguy360> AE and Dusk are equal
[1:12:55] <%1matheuw> @LiquidDinosaur thats blud tho
[1:13:01] <%moogleboy1984> HeXen is impossible
[1:13:01] <+thesyndrome> I like DUSK a bit better, but not by much
[1:13:03] <%seniormeatbox> it's going to get better trust us
[1:13:04] <vulkans2> @LiquidDinosaur That's Blood
[1:13:06] <Aydarkzero> YEAH
[1:13:09] <SaltyGuyMan> Heretic 2 Is legit tho
[1:13:11] <%dekkitout> SPEEN
[1:13:12] <%mMayrro> SPEEN
[1:13:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> blender time
[1:13:13] <ape_hawk> pat, thats not love, that's cholesterol... from the frustration cheese
[1:13:13] <+WarbossMetal> Painkiller, lol
[1:13:15] <%zeif00> Spin2Win
[1:13:18] <%maenos2> that's just blender mode wtf
[1:13:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> SPIN TO WIN
[1:13:20] <Orenjevel> what
[1:13:20] <MetelStar> SPEEN
[1:13:21] <%Typhaeon> HUMILIATION
[1:13:21] <Finakala> Go play the Wayfarer's Tome mod for Heretic, it rebalances the enemies and weapons and it feels SO much better
[1:13:24] <%seniormeatbox> SPEEN
[1:13:24] <+D00msDayDan> this game seems pretty good
[1:13:24] <%logoth_> That cartoonish spin sound is funny
[1:13:25] <dellis80> wtf
[1:13:26] <TrollKing96> Holy shit its Painkiller.
[1:13:27] <+chrishnaw> SPEEN
[1:13:28] <%DukeMoose> CLANGCLANGCLANG
[1:13:31] <%threecheats> mmm smells like Painkiller in here a lil bit and i like it
[1:13:33] <+SaltyGhostRock> vineNut
[1:13:33] <%dekkitout> What an inventive take on axe spin
[1:13:33] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Im sorry what? blender mode!?
[1:13:33] <TioXyco> this is quite amazing
[1:13:35] <MafiaTweek> that acts like a propeller in the water
[1:13:36] <Finakala> And I fucking LOVE Heretic in vanilla even
[1:13:37] <%moogleboy1984> BOOTIE, PLAE DEE EM CEE TU
[1:13:38] <dellis80> is this the chainsaw LUL LUL
[1:13:39] <Orenjevel> why didnt the vikings use their axes like this
[1:13:41] <dauver> is paige asleep?
[1:13:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> Spinning axe will act like a propeller underwater
[1:13:42] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you use the charged aze underwater you swim faster
[1:13:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh the one Dusk is based on. I just beat Dusk the other day its p good
[1:13:47] <dfs_k> overcharged axe makes you go faster in water because of course it does
[1:13:47] <%l3sovikk> I fucking love that Axe
[1:13:51] <RunningNGunning> CLANG
[1:14:00] <+thesyndrome> if you have the spinny axe active, you can use it as a propeller underwater to move faster, I'm not even kidding
[1:14:04] <ape_hawk> is it... axectional?
[1:14:06] <geassguy360> Amid Evil is part Heretic, part Unreal, part Quake 1, and a smidge of Painkiller
[1:14:06] <%Nekros4442> That is some big Crowbar from HL energy there
[1:14:07] <ThomLake> CLANG
[1:14:10] <%Starotter70> It does sound like Berserk 2016 a little
[1:14:19] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Clang clang clang with the trolley
[1:14:19] <%StooEsq> I like Hexen, for as long as I can tolerate the switch stuff
[1:14:23] <SickBowelMovesBro> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:14:23] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Clang!
[1:14:31] <Finakala> Yeah it is very Unreal now I think about it
[1:14:37] <%boomstickery> why are you all up in this evil?
[1:14:43] <%StooEsq> "You have solved 1/7th of the blah blah blah" and all that
[1:14:48] <Aydarkzero> good jump
[1:14:49] <Saltmeisterr> is Heretic like a fps rpg?
[1:14:57] <Finakala> God I would love a modern Unreal, Quake and Heretic in the similar vein as DOOM 2016/Eternal
[1:14:58] <+Brostress> If you shred someone with it, would you call that axe body spray?
[1:14:59] <%maenos2> find the seven crystal babies
[1:15:00] <%seniormeatbox> this game is built like a 90s fps but is lit like a modern game and it looks so much better than it actually is because of it
[1:15:04] <Aydarkzero> the pick ups sound effect reminds me of Maximo
[1:15:16] <SickBowelMovesBro> i love that the FOV is like 390 degrees
[1:15:17] <+thesyndrome> Hexen is a game with INCREDIBLE visuals and gameplay, but the worst level designs I have seen
[1:15:27] <%threecheats> jump coward
[1:15:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> im glad that now retro games are doing 3D FPS because i like me a "classic FPS" but i can't do like, Doom. I cant deal with "fake 3D early FPS it makes me dizzy. I become accutely aware of how you dont really "move" in those the leveljust slides under your feet
[1:15:36] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you had kept the screen flash on 100% every single item pickup would be blinding
[1:15:37] <%maenos2> do a flip
[1:15:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> LEVEL DESIGN
[1:15:39] <Aydarkzero> no fall damage PogChamp
[1:16:12] <+thesyndrome> the water staff has AMAZING homing, I use it for all flying enemies
[1:16:13] <Coystick> Listen to that Hulshultery
[1:16:15] <geassguy360> Hexen is switch Hell, love the art direction tho
[1:16:27] <Finakala> If you really want a sequel to Heretic go play Masters of Chaos, it's a multi-episode WAD with a ton of new textures, new weapons and a bunch of new enemies, some of which are from Hexen
[1:16:32] <narusao> this isn't ori and the forest!
[1:16:32] <SickBowelMovesBro> its auto-aim, from using controller
[1:16:39] <Finakala> It's crazy good
[1:16:41] <%seniormeatbox> @patstaresat I think the level design in this is better than dusk, primarily because it wasn't made entirely in PROBUILDER
[1:16:43] <Coystick> Projectiles coming out of melee weapons might be the coolest thing
[1:16:46] <roninkojiro> Is there no healthbar?
[1:17:02] <Finakala> Health is behind Pat
[1:17:07] <geassguy360> its behind his window
[1:17:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @roninkojiro there is, the camera is obscuring it
[1:17:12] <%moogleboy1984> it's under Pat's face, @roninkojiro
[1:17:13] <%StooEsq> @Finakala Sounds cool, I could go for a Heretic Wad right now
[1:17:13] <%seniormeatbox> @roninkojiro there is pat is just blocking it
[1:17:17] <SickBowelMovesBro> it's regenerating health, from using controller
[1:17:19] <+Javaa01> @roninkojiro The health gauge is behind Pat's couch
[1:17:20] <roninkojiro> Ah, thx
[1:17:30] <JayEarly> YOU GOT SOUL POWER
[1:17:39] <%seniormeatbox> BOUNCE
[1:17:40] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:17:41] <Coystick> It bounce
[1:17:42] <TrollKing96> Still waiting for a retro FPS with an industrial metal soundtrack like Quake 2.
[1:17:56] <Finakala> Sonic Mayhem did good
[1:17:58] <Orenjevel> these weapons are cool
[1:18:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TrollKing96 Hell Hunt maybe?
[1:18:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Goddamn it Pat did you tweet this out
[1:18:21] <%delilah4you> I cant believe they went BEYOND heretic
[1:18:25] <%mMayrro> he did
[1:18:25] <%Typhaeon> Me like big axe guy campaign best
[1:18:25] <+thesyndrome> "what if Hexen wasn't an awful switch-hunting game"
[1:18:31] <%Archphronimos> I mean I know what you're talking about
[1:18:34] <%valriot> man look at this videogame
[1:18:40] <%moogleboy1984> Bastion Pat, Bastion
[1:18:42] <Finakala> I do, and this is why Amid Evil is one of the best FPS of the last few years
[1:18:53] <%heartlesshealer> sord
[1:19:04] <vulkans2> what, people don't like hitting a switch in one map and it opening a door in another? LUL
[1:19:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat has a alternative life as a main character voice for a game

[1:21:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 21m.
[1:21:40] <TioXyco> use spinny axe for faster swimming
[1:21:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Did you know this game has RTX and DLSS 2.0?!
[1:22:02] <%Pyroclase> that's actually really cool
[1:22:02] <%heartlesshealer> paddles?
[1:22:10] <%rosabellamelantha> No hitscanners
[1:22:10] <+WarbossMetal> The A button and B button are too hard to use for jumping and crouching
[1:22:11] <Finakala> There aren't any hitscans and it's lovely
[1:22:11] <%zeif00> LUL
[1:22:12] <%mMayrro> LUL
[1:22:13] <geassguy360> yep paddles make fpses way better on controllers
[1:22:13] <Aydarkzero> i always wanted to get one of those elite controllers either the Xbox one or Astro
[1:22:14] <%WhereIsWill> heresy doodCrazy
[1:22:16] <+D00msDayDan> bungie style
[1:22:23] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt If you hit them in the neck/upper chest with the shotgun sword it does more damage because you're effectively decapitating them
[1:22:23] <%mike2hands> LUL
[1:22:23] <ahmz1404> this game looks cool
[1:22:27] <%rosabellamelantha> Same as Dusk every enemy is projectile based @PatStaresAt
[1:22:31] <Arrowpoison1> All my homies hate hitscan
[1:22:38] <%rosabellamelantha> EARLY TRIDENT
[1:22:39] <%1matheuw> chaingun ahead
[1:22:39] <jabrodey> Played Blood, can confirm
[1:22:39] <%Dementedpenguin> PogChamp
[1:22:40] <Azathotic> I agree, Warframe sucks
[1:22:45] <Aydarkzero> Trident PogChamp
[1:22:50] <%Fien111> @heartlesshealer more shoulder buttoms but where the ring fingers are on the bottom of the controller wings
[1:22:51] <%heartlesshealer> oh, no I get the use. I'm just confused every time it comes up instead of "shoulder button/trigger"
[1:22:52] <%StooEsq> any hitscan enemies in Dusk would make Duskmare an actual nightmare
[1:22:53] <%moogleboy1984> Trident is the BEST gun
[1:22:55] <%AdamElJefe> Sick trident bro
[1:22:55] <%WhereIsWill> PogChamp
[1:22:58] <%heartlesshealer> conjures images in my head
[1:23:01] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt keep shooting an enemy after it dies for fun
[1:23:02] <%1matheuw> @Azathotic warframe is alright
[1:23:06] <geassguy360> On Doom Eternal I rebound Jump and Dash to L3 and Left Shoulder
[1:23:08] <%StooEsq> Voltride is cool
[1:23:16] <%heartlesshealer> @Fien111 Nice!
[1:23:22] <pmtriox> Hexen?
[1:23:28] <+Neoepochx> Did Dave make fun of @PatStaresAt Yet?
[1:23:29] <Kirbachev> Ride the lightning, motherfucker
[1:23:34] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Hey remember how the Plasma Rifle blows up shielded enemies in Eternal if you shoot them long enough? Basically that
[1:23:40] <geassguy360> not yet
[1:23:45] <%SuttonsGaming> geassguy360 i remember rebinding L3 to Jump back when i played Blops 3 on PS4
[1:23:48] <%moogleboy1984> keep shooting them even after they die
[1:23:49] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:23:52] <Finakala> Voltride overkill is dope af
[1:23:55] <%QuietteShy> keep shooting enemy when they are all electrified and eventually they will explode and do huge AOE damage
[1:23:57] <%templar010> CHAIN LIGHTNING
[1:23:57] <%SuttonsGaming> it made it much easier to jump and shoot
[1:23:58] <%moogleboy1984> the BEST gun

[1:25:37] <SickBowelMovesBro> hitscan enemies suck, but what's the problem with hitscan weapons for the player?
[1:25:43] <+Kindan55> What's Bonkin guys?
[1:25:44] <Pookiedaexzile> The Dev team in chat wirtting down notes for Amid evil 2. Because I not only want dual weilding but also Team death match

[1:26:21] <%StooEsq> Check out Ziggurat for another FPS (roguelike stuff, but it's fine) with Heretic/Hexen-ish weapons. One of them is straight-up the Serpent Staff.
[1:26:26] <%DukeMoose> its Dave laughing at you i bet
[1:26:28] <MafiaTweek> nah that's the champion

[1:27:15] <MafiaTweek> you get an achievement when you blow up earth
[1:27:20] <%delilah4you> The developers said there is a low probability that one of the planets you fire is Earth.
[1:27:22] <%1matheuw> overkill shoots stars i think
[1:27:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck ya whole globe billions dead
[1:27:25] <%Fien111> I mean, 90s FPS style

[1:28:53] <%SharkMissile> Does this have the duke Nukem aesthetic where you grunt against every surface until you find a secret?
[1:29:14] <+Kindan55> nuke?
[1:29:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> SHOOT THE EARTH
[1:29:18] <geassguy360> back is quick save i think

[1:31:23] <%Pyroclase> When you cover up the healthbar with your PIP it's hard to tell how hard you're getting your ass kicked...
[1:31:28] <Pookiedaexzile> I just wanna waste ten hours complaining about one of the weapons after losing a multiplayer match
[1:31:32] <TioXyco> the trident seems to be on point
[1:31:38] <Pookiedaexzile> But The devs aint tryin to give me that

[1:32:41] <%WhereIsWill> makes me wish my magus DND campaign was still goin
[1:32:45] <+Spawntaneous501> Is that a serious same jump noise?
[1:32:46] <SickBowelMovesBro> this is not a real WR run, this is a recording!!
[1:32:47] <+Kindan55> Show us a pro gamer move, pat.
[1:32:52] <%heartlesshealer> you opened stuff up by reaching the upstairs the long way
[1:33:03] <%Promessa_EX> Because you play all games on normal
[1:33:05] <+MoroseLoki> nah
[1:33:13] <Sunstalker> You say that Pat, but you got stuck on a staircase in Dark souls 3 for over an hour and yesterday with Ornifex's bonfire was starting to become a new one.
[1:33:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait you can cut bullets
[1:33:18] <geassguy360> projectile blocking is dank
[1:33:34] <%heartlesshealer> because monster closet
[1:33:35] <SchlongKongEduardo> lidl secret
[1:33:45] <%1matheuw> its a mandatory secret so it dont count
[1:34:05] <%deepseal44> GO PAT GO
[1:34:09] <%StooEsq> I've been having a lot of "That's a secret?" moments in these newer FPSes
[1:34:11] <%rosabellamelantha> the actual secret gets you the bfg like this level if I remember right
[1:34:12] <+MoroseLoki> love how those beams cancel
[1:34:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now I got the Battle block Secret song in my Head
[1:34:17] <+Kindan55> Like that the gibs stay.
[1:34:36] <MafiaTweek> you can hold fire to just keep swinging the sword
[1:34:39] <%SharkMissile> Nice shot
[1:34:46] <%heartlesshealer> I love how the azure orb just melts enemies into pillars of water
[1:35:00] <%WhereIsWill> PogChamp
[1:35:02] <+Javaa01> Button on the ground
[1:35:18] <%FluffiTamamo> I remember Dakooters playing this too. Has Pat found any soap bars?
[1:35:21] <%1matheuw> thats a cool ladder
[1:35:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> All weapons are automatic. You can just hold and shoot
[1:35:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Why @newblood When you releasing the multiplayer for Amid Evil
[1:35:39] <%StooEsq> Amid Evil have some very nice architecture
[1:35:53] <%StooEsq> *has
[1:35:59] <MordiganRomdeau> this looks a lot like Hexen
[1:36:01] <+spinalwizard> Overkill with the axe, hehehe
[1:36:08] <%rosabellamelantha> Fuck the bomb tossers on Evil difficulty
[1:36:10] <SickBowelMovesBro> So does this have old-school level-after-level structure? Not (semi)open world or such?
[1:36:14] <MafiaTweek> i like the strategy with trident, you wanna keep shooting but you gotta move to avoid damage
[1:36:22] <therakishsage> I don't think you can drown in this.
[1:36:32] <%dasmause> yep, linear levels
[1:36:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat just dived into some Mnt Dew High Voltage

[1:37:28] <bringmecoffeeortea> damn thought today was Deadly Premonition 2 day
[1:37:30] <%StooEsq> Azure Agony Blue is nice shade of color for a house
[1:37:37] <+Neoepochx> Did Pat finish Dusk?
[1:37:39] <+Lugia0123> Rich evans is that you?

[1:38:07] <Decsevm> I remember watching a speed run a while back what was the tool that made you go fast underwater?
[1:38:08] <missingangle> Aaaand it's gone!
[1:38:09] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[1:38:12] <+Kindan55> Oh yeah, why no Deadly Premonition?
[1:38:16] <%WhereIsWill> no thoughts game good
[1:38:20] <Pookiedaexzile> That's the best feeling
[1:38:23] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this game has 7 episodes btw but each episode is much shorter than dusk's episodes so it averages out to around the same
[1:38:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Coystick No she still yet lives
[1:38:27] <%SpicyVibration> dp2 is friday
[1:38:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Just letting a thought go

[1:39:49] <%l3sovikk> The Ax is fucking nuts
[1:39:55] <%spongeofmystery> "Even also"
[1:40:08] <rearedlogarithm> Is this a Hexen-like?
[1:40:11] <%dasmause> they give you each weapon on every level cause you can turn on the warrior mode that takes away all your weapons between each level
[1:40:23] <Decsevm> was it the axe that spins under water trident?
[1:40:24] <%dinnydanny777> The staff guys kind of look like the goblin guys from Ocarina of Time
[1:40:25] <%theGreatGoon > more like amid axe amitrite
[1:40:26] <BoneofMalkav> Yes, Especially when Smarch is Smores Month LUL
[1:40:31] <bigshedman> Hey Pat, hey gang HeyGuys
[1:40:35] <suddenlyscorched> The Axe hates evil, and physically draws enemies towards the blade
[1:40:42] <ThorgrimFunhammer> ok magic shooty melee weapons are growing on me
[1:40:42] <+chase959> it that a trident or a crossbow?
[1:40:47] <%moogleboy1984> Axemid Evil

[1:41:17] <SickBowelMovesBro> AMID THE EVIL RESIDING WITHIN
[1:41:22] <PunishedMercer_> it draws them wearing dresses
[1:41:24] <suddenlyscorched> Like if an enemy is just outside melee range, the Axe will bring the enemy TO melee range
[1:41:25] <%heartlesshealer> it's a lamp
[1:41:28] <Decsevm> @dasmause ty
[1:41:29] <%rosabellamelantha> this levels secret took me a bit
[1:41:41] <%rosabellamelantha> don't worry you will miss most of the secrets in this game
[1:42:19] <MafiaTweek> ion fury is the worst with secrets i can't find a damn one
[1:42:19] <%heartlesshealer> psaGib ?
[1:42:28] <%l3sovikk> Use the Axe Soul gauge attack

[1:43:03] <BoneofMalkav> psaGib
[1:43:08] <%Pyroclase> Does Elmo have SOCIALIST TEETH?
[1:43:18] <%rosabellamelantha> Ion fury is FULL of super obscure secrets
[1:43:27] <%rosabellamelantha> I love it though
[1:43:36] <%rosabellamelantha> the only problem Ion fury has is the hitscanners
[1:43:38] <%Pyroclase> Ion Fury honestly hides its secrets TOO well, it's so hard to find them
[1:44:03] <BoneofMalkav> "Eat Explosive Planets!"
[1:44:14] <Pookiedaexzile> You guys keep calling Ion Maiden a weird name
[1:44:18] <%pectusumbra> alright, so I just came over from Woolie, what's up?
[1:44:19] <Pookiedaexzile> what gives
[1:44:21] <Decsevm> hoes mad
[1:44:23] <SickBowelMovesBro> true, i like my secrets more Turok-like rather than Doom(classic)-like
[1:44:23] <mastermidget23> I'm still annoyed they couldn't go with their original title Ion Maiden
[1:44:24] <%1matheuw> elmad
[1:44:27] <CursedNobleman> im trying to beat a build engine FPS, shadow warrior and blood and tough, and duke 3d gives me nausea
[1:44:29] <bigshedman> Father, I wish to tell you about the class struggles in our capitalist society
[1:44:31] <%SpicyVibration> Elmo is mad at all the evil in the world
[1:44:35] <%heartlesshealer> Elmo has teeth showing in this emote psaPorgmo
[1:44:48] <%rosabellamelantha> Iron Maiden's lawyers need to shut the fuck up and let people have nice things
[1:44:58] <ThorgrimFunhammer> emlo scremlo FOR JUSTICE
[1:45:03] <Pookiedaexzile> @pectusumbra we trying to cyberbully new blood into multplayer for Amid Evil
[1:45:05] <%SharkMissile> Elmo feels for the struggles of the proletariat
[1:45:07] <%WhereIsWill> if theres invisible enemies in this the trident wil be goat
[1:45:11] <%dasmause> also isnt iron maiden a common name for torture device?
[1:45:19] <Finakala> I was gonna get Ion Fury in the sale but forgot, whoops
[1:45:21] <%rosabellamelantha> It is
[1:45:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Whats Iron Maiden, is that a midevil version of the great game ion Maiden
[1:45:32] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @rosabellamelantha ion furys also unfortunately made by fucks
[1:45:34] <SickBowelMovesBro> also, isnt ion maiden a different word??
[1:45:35] <%heartlesshealer> Iron Maiden? The band, or is there some new weird group?
[1:45:45] <%rosabellamelantha> The band
[1:45:57] <%threecheats> the iron maiden torture device is mostly a myth, first recorded one was a metal casket with some spikes near it
[1:45:58] <%SpicyVibration> Elmo is mad at all the punk bitches not wearing masks
[1:46:02] <%rosabellamelantha> their lawyers tried to kill Ion Fury because it was originally called Ion Maiden
[1:46:09] <SickBowelMovesBro> y tf can Iron Maiden sue something called Ion Maiden
[1:46:09] <Pookiedaexzile> What Band, I've never heard of em are they good
[1:46:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> So trident is a mix between minigun and plasma gun?
[1:46:21] <%floralkami> @pookiedaexzile the band or the torture device?
[1:46:27] <Kalinflip> ok zoomers atpCap
[1:46:28] <%rosabellamelantha> And according to capitalism Iron maiden the band now own the name iron maiden
[1:46:29] <%rosabellamelantha> fun
[1:46:39] <%rosabellamelantha> Iron maiden were good at one point
[1:46:45] <februero> I'd pay to see a match between Disney lawyers and Iron Maiden lawyers
[1:46:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @floralkami the perk
[1:46:59] <%heartlesshealer> Ion Maiden is legally distinct from Iron Maiden. Fuck them and their manager
[1:47:07] <%floralkami> @rosabellamelantha that sounds like a bitch move from what used to be a good band...
[1:47:12] <%SpicyVibration> the world, father
[1:47:17] <%rosabellamelantha> it is
[1:47:27] <Finakala> The band literally had nothing to do with it, their legal team took it on themselves
[1:47:28] <%dasmause> also they have no leg to stand on copywriting iron maiden
[1:47:29] <%Pyroclase> The lawsuit was 100% bullshit, Iron Maidens were a thing long before the band existed
[1:47:30] <DaBigVitus> maiden were best with paul di'anno anyway!

[1:47:58] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> bands have usually exactly zero input on their lawyers actions

[1:50:01] <Pookiedaexzile> @newblood When you adding in multiplayer for Amid Evil
[1:50:02] <Frostydough1> so no premonition otday? :/
[1:50:14] <%rosabellamelantha> @SaltkeyAndAckfish The game Ion Fury was originally called Ion Maiden, the band iron maiden's lawyers decided this wasn't ok despite iron maiden not being a name you can legally copyright
[1:50:15] <stardustcrusad3r> psaElmo look at what i unclock with pat points
[1:50:23] <%rosabellamelantha> and thus the devs had to change to ion fury
[1:50:36] <+keyoray> How...how is Pat cleaning Elmo? They ran out of baby wipes, and cat baths are not a short affair...
[1:50:39] <RetributionP> return of the smellmo
[1:50:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @rosabellamelantha ah gotcha, thanks for the summary!
[1:50:46] <%optimasmaximas> afternoon guys psaUp
[1:50:53] <%arcielardor> does Pat just spray febreeze on Elmo?
[1:51:01] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @rosabellamelantha wait so they got a cease and desist??

[1:51:46] <%ekodrop> spraying him with a garden hose would require going outside
[1:51:47] <%optimasmaximas> did he make a poopy in his pants and is spraying his bum?
[1:51:49] <+keyoray> @XeroSigmaPrime but Elmo is already white. Or was he a different color at the start?
[1:51:54] <$0dokuro> Thats why he gets so much hair on him, gotta lick the baby clean.
[1:51:57] <%rosabellamelantha> Yeah they got a cease and desist if I remember right

[1:52:26] <%rosabellamelantha> BTW FUN FACT this isn't the only legal issue Ion Fury ran into, RANDY BITCHFORD TRIED TO KILL IT TOO because bombshell was originally a duke nukem character
[1:52:29] <%rosabellamelantha> fuck you randy
[1:52:43] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL of course I show up during a break
[1:52:58] <@SoFarFetched> didn't Ion Fury have a problem with a word that was put in it?
[1:53:03] <%YakumoYomi> Elmo smelly. He must be purified.
[1:53:08] <%arcielardor> psaPorgmo psaElmo psaWink psaBlep psaBig psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:53:12] <%rosabellamelantha> yeah they removed it though
[1:53:20] <@SoFarFetched> Oh that's cool
[1:53:20] <%rosabellamelantha> and apologised
[1:53:25] <karovus> randy no
[1:53:30] <@SoFarFetched> Cause I held off on buying it because of that.
[1:53:36] <rekinom> Ah yes, good ol' Randy 'Squirting is a magic trick because I've never made a girl cum" Pitchford
[1:53:37] <@SoFarFetched> though sale is over but oh well LUL
[1:53:38] <jorniev> ion fury was called ion maiden, but legal trubles happened
[1:53:43] <@SoFarFetched> I got a good amount of games
[1:53:48] <%AncelDeLambert> it had a "problem" with a gag bottle of shampoo that was a parody ofa well known brand name
[1:53:57] <%maskofmichael> Did Elmo kill Pat?
[1:54:03] <@SoFarFetched> with the smell of piss? yes
[1:54:05] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE IS OUR GOD KING
[1:54:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @rosabellamelantha that's actually crazy. By the way, did you know iron maiden released a computer game, it was called Ed Hunter, where you played as Eddie going through levels based on their albums
[1:54:06] <jorniev> maybe
[1:54:14] <%optimasmaximas> fr wtf happened
[1:54:20] <jorniev> PARYSE THE ELMO
[1:54:31] <@SoFarFetched> are you asking why we are on brb? Cause Elmo smells like pee pee and pat has to clean da baby
[1:54:44] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[1:54:45] <%optimasmaximas> thanks
[1:55:04] <%rosabellamelantha> Randy is also sueing the devs of the company because when they sold him duke nukem he didn't read the contract very well and didn't realise that he doesn't own the music to duke nukem and thus legally can't re-release it unless he pays the composer which he REFUSES to do
[1:55:12] <%optimasmaximas> hello pat

[1:56:23] <%SvenHolgersson> HAS DAVID CAGE TAUGHT YOU NOTHING
[1:56:24] <TrashbagZombie> This is how the robot uprising starts. First the poop robots revolt.
[1:56:26] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> I came back home after about 4 months and found out my younger brother never cleaned out the chicken coop in all that time. Ohhhh man.
[1:56:26] <%SvenHolgersson> THATS A SLAVE
[1:56:28] <+keyoray> Shave his underbelly. Less fur pee.
[1:56:28] <%AdamElJefe> @PatStaresAt What's the name of the poop robot? I might get one for my cats

[1:56:30] <+linSP> fix your son please he is broken
[1:56:33] <%YakumoYomi> The robot unplugged itself to end its own suffering
[1:56:34] <robodisney> I had a litter maid once but it just got jammed up and stopped working

[1:57:15] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> poop-roomba. The poomba
[1:57:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would you want a japanese toilet
[1:57:19] <@SoFarFetched> I believe you just gotta look up auto-cleaning litter box and you get a bunch of different choices.
[1:57:19] <%Cozy90> man i wish theyd make a bigger coop version of this game. i always thought hexen was awesome
[1:57:31] <@SoFarFetched> Cause there's one auto-cleaning litter box for cat's that's like $500.
[1:57:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> but pat, your toilet coud sing to you.
[1:57:33] <$0dokuro> This is a paper household, no water
[1:57:41] <jimmytwofeet> this reminds me a lot of Heretic
[1:57:48] <%YakumoYomi> The pandemic (and resulting shortage of toilet paper) made bidets super popular
[1:58:05] <@SoFarFetched> So best go for what's good for your wallet, if you're going for those auto-cleaner litter boxes SeemsGood
[1:58:07] <+paladinstarbuster> Like the microwave beam in eternal
[1:58:09] <+Toughgoing> How does this compare to Dusk?

[2:00:38] <%floralkami> lol, I guess I have to try Dusk multiplayer soon. I'm guessing there's a discord?
[2:00:46] <$0dokuro> The weapons are great, really makes this standout.

[2:01:14] <+Javaa01> But the colored lighting was a source port addition
[2:01:15] <%Pyroclase> because rooms can't be on top of each other
[2:01:19] <%Essixian> @Finakala This game is the Dark Souls of itself

[2:13:16] <+213372bu> 343 released the MCC on PC and it's even more buggy than the Xbox release... o top of that 343's games have been nothing but bad interpretations of the old Halo books... the whole situation is just so devoid of interest can't even get mad

[2:15:58] <%heartlesshealer> if you ever see earth on there, fire
[2:16:00] <%rosabellamelantha> it is
[2:16:01] <+Javaa01> Earth is definitely one of them
[2:16:01] <%FusRoDom> it is
[2:16:01] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie will be a pro FPS player by next month
[2:16:02] <Speccu_> THE WORLD IS A TREE CONFIRMED PAT VERIFYING NORSE MYTHOLOGY
[2:16:06] <%13ry4n93> does the different planets act differently?
[2:16:07] <%optimasmaximas> @13ry4n93 alright one guy, the general consensus these days is that rushed games are bad, you want it released in september like normal and have it be more buggy?
[2:16:11] <%l3sovikk> They're real
[2:16:14] <a_mad_dragon> earth is a nuke
[2:16:14] <+dmtjinni> Horny Alcoholic Americans can't set home for 60 days to save their country SMH
[2:16:16] <+Javaa01> There are real planets, and then there are fake planets
[2:16:17] <%heartlesshealer> Mix and match of real and fake planets
[2:16:18] <%Cozy90> NO PAT THEYRE ALL REAL PLANETS IRL
[2:16:21] <+Javaa01> Moons are also included
[2:16:23] <%l3sovikk> There's a 'chievo for blowing up earth
[2:16:23] <%Promessa_EX> DOA would be the last game to have a creepy sex scandal
[2:16:23] <Pnutz409> earth is low %
[2:16:25] <CursedNobleman> ***
[2:16:26] <%delilah4you> Theres a low percentage chance earth will be one
[2:16:29] <%1matheuw> symmetra turrets
[2:16:31] <Sundaysmiles01> So long as woolie stays off the controller, he will go fps pro
[2:16:33] <%floralkami> @13ry4n93 when they turn into stars, yeah
[2:16:36] <%ItsCaptainDisco> You fools, we are all a part of Discworld
[2:16:37] <%heartlesshealer> at least coloring-wise
[2:16:40] <OToole42> 1 in 52 chance for earth
[2:16:41] <%optimasmaximas> oh...interesting
[2:16:48] <+OwlLightningMage> It verifies that Tales of Symphonia is real history
[2:16:49] <The_500lb_Child> But is Pluto included? This is the important question.
[2:16:50] <%AdamElJefe> @13ry4n93 You sound like you think you're entitled. Let the game be delayed for as long as possible to make it good.
[2:17:05] <%tusk102> what is this
[2:17:05] <%l3sovikk> These aren't the sun bois
[2:17:07] <%WhereIsWill> look at these horrible cthulhu monstars
[2:17:08] <MafiaTweek> these aren't sun people
[2:17:09] <%YakumoYomi> @Pookiedaexzile How's DOA6, by the way? I kinda forgot that it came out last year, and all I heard about it was KT's standard DLC shenanigans.
[2:17:22] <MafiaTweek> they're perfectionists who accidentally infected themselves with parasites
[2:17:26] <%Cozy90> cthulu people
[2:17:29] <CursedNobleman> the dlc is hell apparently LUL
[2:17:31] <1BeatGames> Eeeeuuuugggghhhh these enemies are creepy
[2:17:32] <%FusRoDom> Read the codex mannnnnn
[2:17:32] <+Javaa01> Sun people are later on
[2:17:33] <Sundaysmiles01> that is some metal as fuck art
[2:17:40] <%SmokerWest> Is this a good Quake clone?
[2:17:43] <%Promessa_EX> Doa6 would be good without dlc shenanigans and shit online
[2:17:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> \\` [T] //
[2:17:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Who watches the watchers when they have to watch watchers
[2:17:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is this a DOOM like game?
[2:17:54] <%dinnydanny777> The watchers they laugh
[2:18:02] <OToole42> hexen/heretic @SmokerWest
[2:18:04] <Pnutz409> agdq was the first time i saw this game. the devs were doing commentary as the runner went through the game. it's a great watch
[2:18:10] <%optimasmaximas> @YakumoYomi @CursedNobleman @Pookiedaexzile didnt woolie and pat talk about how the dlc total costs is literally over 9k?
[2:18:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> god, the new pork belly burger from Steak and Shake is just...terrible.
[2:18:18] <Finakala> Best Quake since 1996
[2:18:31] <+Javaa01> Says as he fires a hitscan weapon
[2:18:35] <%thegreenbenis> Hitscan for me, but not for thee
[2:18:36] <bigshedman> I dunno dude, that lightning looks pretty hitscan
[2:18:36] <CursedNobleman> @optimasmaximas they probably mentioned that. lemme check the steam store
[2:18:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Who watches the watchers kids when they go out binge drinking from the stress of watching watchers
[2:18:41] <%dasmause> isnt voltrod a hitscan
[2:18:42] <Pookiedaexzile> @optimasmaximas You buying Pervert Fits thats on you son
[2:18:42] <%bugz_munny> PAT ARE YOU USING ONE OF THEM STICKPADS AGAIN
[2:18:46] <%jhonxiolonn> psaLiz wepons
[2:18:51] <+GeneralHysterics> yeah, I was gonna say. Lightning staff is totally hitscan
[2:18:54] <%floralkami> fuck, I love this graphical style
[2:18:54] <Finakala> Voltride is close enough to hitscan
[2:18:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is this a doom/quake-like game?
[2:18:56] <%SmokerWest> Controllers are good,
[2:18:57] <%arcielardor> what does that mean?
[2:19:02] <%arcielardor> hitscan
[2:19:04] <Pookiedaexzile> It will cost 9k to get all the Bikinis yes
[2:19:05] <%bugz_munny> You know what I told you about them stickpads
[2:19:08] <+paladinstarbuster> who?
[2:19:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Kill the dog and feel guilty
[2:19:13] <%optimasmaximas> @CursedNobleman think it was a csb clip woolie uploaded last year
[2:19:13] <%bugz_munny> You dont know whatcha messin with
[2:19:22] <+Javaa01> Well, the moon is saved for now
[2:19:22] <MafiaTweek> pat needs to add a steering wheel and peddles for the woolie fps experience
[2:19:24] <Finakala> Korone is great, but it's not Dusk cartdog
[2:19:25] <%SmokerWest> This game is really fluid.
[2:19:27] <%optimasmaximas> @Pookiedaexzile god i heard those dlc items are atrocious
[2:19:28] <%Promessa_EX> That’s why I only buy honoka costumes
[2:19:28] <%floralkami> @paladinstarbuster Hololive VTuber
[2:19:32] <%Broand> Hitscan means there's no projectile, it just instantly hits whatever it's aiming at
[2:19:37] <%Cozy90> YO! New castle super beast animated on woolie's channel just came out
[2:19:45] <bigshedman> Stop brinnin' these stickpads games into my house!
[2:19:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt but pat if you kill the dog you'll get a cutscene dedicated to it Kappa
[2:19:52] <+GeneralHysterics> when you pull the trigger the game draws a line immediately to where you're pointing and damages whatever is in it's way @arcielardor
[2:19:52] <%Nobrev> @arcielardor hitscan weapons have attacks that instantly hit where you're pointing and projectile weapons have actual traveling projectiles
[2:20:03] <CursedNobleman> Yep. DOA6 is approx $900
[2:20:09] <%optimasmaximas> what vtuber we talkin about???
[2:20:10] <%angel949> Hitscan means the "bullets" don't have travel time in game, they hit their target as soon as you pull the trigger
[2:20:10] <Manwad> @arcielardor Hitscan is a form of like, way to deal with firing guns. The game basically fires a laser at the cursor. The other method is projectiles, shit like rocket launchers in most games.
[2:20:18] <%spongeofmystery> Chaos baguettes destruction
[2:20:19] <televisedrevolting> Chaos Baguettes Destruction
[2:20:27] <Finakala> Yeah hitscan enemies just hit you based on pure RNG rather than you being in the way
[2:20:27] <%arcielardor> ahh
[2:20:29] <+dmtjinni> Is Pat gona play MHW?
[2:20:32] <+OwlLightningMage> There's a dog vtuber that Pat retweets
[2:20:34] <Pnutz409> must be tastu
[2:20:36] <Finakala> Just a chance of taking damage if you're in their sight
[2:20:36] <%Invlux> Bark with me if you're my dog
[2:20:38] <+GeneralHysterics> fuckin, fps nerds jumpin out the woodwork to explain definitions, lol.
[2:20:40] <Pookiedaexzile> @optimasmaximas Oh they are...which is why you plug in Doa 4 ultimate when you get salty and forget about how they added Supers in 6 you can't parry.
[2:20:40] <%optimasmaximas> nice job you guys @spongeofmystery @televisedrevolting
[2:20:41] <Pnutz409> *tasty
[2:20:48] <oJxn> PLAY WITH K&B AND MOUSE YOU GOBLIN MAN
[2:21:01] <+GeneralHysterics> controller is fine, dude.
[2:21:09] <%SmokerWest> @oJxn no u
[2:21:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> I much prefer the arsenal in amid evil
[2:21:14] <%crimsonharvest> they're very 90s pc huh
[2:21:25] <Finakala> Amid Evil's chapter 6 and 7 are better than Dusk tbh
[2:21:33] <+GeneralHysterics> @daveoshry where you at
[2:21:36] <Coystick> I hope Dave optimizes Gloomwood's dynamic shadows before release, my toaster weeps
[2:21:37] <Finakala> But Dusk's ep 3 is better than the first 5 chapters of AE
[2:21:37] <%l3sovikk> Wait 'til you get the game's BFG
[2:21:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> tell you what, this FOV makes me happy
[2:21:52] <%pectusumbra> I'm sure someone can figure out a way to mod that
[2:21:55] <%SmokerWest> Quake didn't have a BFG did it?
[2:21:59] <Pookiedaexzile> @GeneralHysterics Just @Oshry
[2:22:04] <Sundaysmiles01> can you combo weapon effects via rapid switching?
[2:22:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> And they all feel great to shoot
[2:22:06] <%arcielardor> it looks like you have more mobility in this, too.
[2:22:11] <Finakala> Quake had the Thunderbolt but that's it
[2:22:14] <+GeneralHysterics> tyty
[2:22:23] <%Fien111> Pat stop being a scrub and use a flightstick
[2:22:31] <huskarl_zap> Ahh Helshult a real metal artist
[2:22:36] <%tusk102> wheres pats healthbar?
[2:22:43] <+GeneralHysterics> use ddr pad you coward
[2:22:45] <%optimasmaximas> @Pookiedaexzile never played a doa game (im 19 and recently got into fightin games the past couple years (payed attention to fg story stuff a couple years before that), first fightin game i bought was injustice 2 and have mk11, got skullgirls and played strive beta) , so my knowledge is almost none, are the supers like fatalblows in mk11?
[2:22:45] <Coystick> Why the fuck aren't Flightsticks still a thing anyway
[2:22:45] <+OwlLightningMage> Guitar Hero Wammy bar or nothing
[2:22:45] <Finakala> Andrew Hulschult is a boss
[2:23:03] <%crimsonharvest> feels like maybe the lightning should latch on after the first hit
[2:23:05] <%Promessa_EX> The pat in the bottom left represents his health
[2:23:07] <%optimasmaximas> must be the work of an enemy stand
[2:23:18] <%SmokerWest> With a conTROLLer
[2:23:19] <Coystick> AMID DUST
[2:23:27] <theshillman> have the developers yelled at him for this yet?
[2:23:30] <%tusk102> @Promessa_EX the more damage he takes the more pat hollows out
[2:23:37] <%angel949> Ah yes I too remember Dust: An Elysien Tale
[2:23:41] <Finakala> Fun fact, this game also has rocket jumping, or planet jumping specifically I guess
[2:23:41] <+GeneralHysterics> health is covered by the ORB
[2:23:43] <%Joustar_> use woolie's heretical setup
[2:23:47] <%Typhaeon> I can't believe you played Dust: An Elysian Tale with a controller
[2:23:52] <Coystick> Pat is just bleeding gamer cred on stream
[2:23:58] <OldOnyx> hey, I don't expect pad players to get names straight or spell correctly
[2:24:08] <+GeneralHysterics> lmao
[2:24:11] <Aydarkzero> Controllers are rad though
[2:24:12] <%floralkami> @theshillman yes, one was in here like 25 minutes ago
[2:24:12] <TheTakkster> minecraft dungeons got a patch, huh?
[2:24:13] <Gallhint> true
[2:24:13] <%1matheuw> oh dont say that
[2:24:13] <%pectusumbra> sorry what game?
[2:24:15] <%optimasmaximas> @OldOnyx LUL
[2:24:16] <moonmintparadise> it is so weird to me that the weapons could be such incredible pixelart and the textures have such a high level of detail but then the enemies just look super off sometimes
[2:24:17] <%Joustar_> he's right.
[2:24:17] <%ergulor> Fuck you fidget is great
[2:24:18] <Manwad> dust looked cool tho
[2:24:19] <Azathotic> LUL
[2:24:21] <theshillman> lol
[2:24:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> What's wrong with the characters?
[2:24:26] <%bigboy3d> The main character looked great, but the NPCs.....
[2:24:27] <+GeneralHysterics> I remember it being a pretty decent action game but I don't remember anything about how it plays
[2:24:28] <%1matheuw> dust is cool tho
[2:24:37] <keatiestofthegribbles> this a turok clone?
[2:24:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> dust was great
[2:24:39] <%Typhaeon> The main character animations were sick at least
[2:24:41] <$Mekhet09> Wow down with the furries pat.
[2:24:41] <karovus> id rather look at the characters than listen to them
[2:24:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> just their general design?
[2:24:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> and it looked amazing
[2:24:49] <$Mekhet09> or not down lol.
[2:24:51] <theshillman> @floralkami gonna have to catch that on the vod
[2:24:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat hated the designs

[2:26:22] <@thenefftw> thenefftw subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! I've meant to resub for a while, but VTubers have been distracting me. Who knew that cute anime girls could be such massive degenerates. Keep on doing your thing, Pat.

[2:26:50] <%spongeofmystery> Try Witcher 3 with mouse and keyboard
[2:26:50] <CursedNobleman> @theshillman its practically the setup for mario galaxy.

[2:29:27] <%optimasmaximas> non-tangible setups?
[2:29:27] <bigshedman> But Pat, you are already home.
[2:29:29] <Sol_Install> nah I feel ya
[2:29:29] <%Deano8817> that sounds like a saturn problem
[2:29:32] <%brickwall35> tell us how you really feel
[2:29:34] <+Jaysky> He HATES videogames chat
[2:29:34] <%Fien111> To be fair.....Saturn sucks
[2:29:34] <%IminyourBase> imagine ex-game testers not testing games
[2:29:35] <%SaiyanShoto> So you’re a coward then
[2:29:35] <ArkSeaside> remembering the THUG1 LP, yeah
[2:29:35] <%ssjklyco> That seems more like a Saturn issue. Since Saturn sucked
[2:29:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Those Bumble fuck boys are at it again
[2:29:36] <CursedNobleman> how much was the saturn again? LUL
[2:29:38] <%Invlux> Who would emulate the Saturn anyways Kappa
[2:29:38] <%SmokerWest> That's just because you didn't make the setup perhaps.
[2:29:38] <%crimsonharvest> saturn is like trying to do n64, its a shitshow in every direction
[2:29:40] <Azathotic> I'm getting Deja Vu from Max's recent stream
[2:29:41] <vobent> BibleThump
[2:29:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> that sounds like doo doo
[2:29:47] <+GeneralHysterics> rip saturn, lol
[2:29:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Don't worry Pat you can record DS3 every day until you beat it LUL
[2:29:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> They got you there LUL
[2:29:54] <%Cozy90> I totally get it but i will say that i got it to run in 10 minutes on 3 computers for my friends.
[2:29:58] <+Remery_> The Saturn tried its best
[2:29:59] <Aydarkzero> @Azathotic all things considered that stream was very chill
[2:29:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Just plug in your Wii to the stream Kappa
[2:30:01] <+Toughgoing> You can throw Saturn at the enemies
[2:30:01] <%Townspoon> Watching you set it up is also content though
[2:30:02] <Coystick> Saturns aren't meant to boot, they're meant to weep
[2:30:03] <OlavOlavsson> is the sega saturn even real
[2:30:06] <%BinaryFireball> DS3 Consumables only run
[2:30:10] <%tinyswampthing> wasnt the saturn a notoriously fucked cosnole to work with>
[2:30:11] <%WhereIsWill> im actually working on silent hill 2 in 4k as we speak on my emulator LUL
[2:30:12] <+spinalwizard> RE

[2:30:22] <%Fien111> Mutiple RE games
[2:30:23] <%ssjklyco> Saturn: The Stadia of home consoles
[2:30:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie is really bad at planning
[2:30:25] <TioXyco> PSP. FFT
[2:30:27] <bigshedman> Saturn was literally born to die LUL
[2:30:30] <@SoFarFetched> The old resident evil games with the texture mods
[2:30:33] <%Cozy90> @optimasmaximas resident evil outbreak files 1 and 2
[2:30:34] <%pectusumbra> Didn't you do REMake with Dolphin and high textures?
[2:30:36] <%ladomania> bruh
[2:30:36] <%Grimlockfly> You just need duct tape and a dream and emulate anything you want.
[2:30:41] <Psyramics> And you tested to make sure those games booted before you went live
[2:30:42] <keatiestofthegribbles> the saturn is tough tho thing can fall 4 storys high and kill something
[2:30:43] <%vectorless_peon> thats just because youve been soured
[2:30:44] <Pookiedaexzile> This is a Mean joke and I don't mean it: You emulate Selfconfidence every day pat
[2:30:45] <%ladomania> you used dolphin for that
[2:30:50] <Coystick> Saturn is the Orphan of Kos of Consoles
[2:30:51] <%Cozy90> @optimasmaximas theres a fan hosted server thats been up for a few years
[2:30:57] <televisedrevolting> I've just been playing emulated SNES and GBA games these past couple weeks.
[2:31:01] <+The_Protagonist> I just grabbed that big ol Genesis/Mega Drive bundle of 50+ sega games on Steam for $8 or whatever it was during the Summer Sale to do some retro streams kukitaAWOOO56709_SG rebelPEW
[2:31:02] <%crimsonharvest> we had good working PSX emulation in the year 2000, whereas Saturn has never booted once
[2:31:07] <%SmokerWest> Use the Sega Saturn to crush the zombies heads.
[2:31:10] <%heartlesshealer> Do PS1 games from the Platystation Store count as emulation?
[2:31:14] <Azathotic> With the amount of mods you put in New Vegas it might as well be an emulation
[2:31:21] <OlavOlavsson> the RE's are kinda cheating cause the dolphin versions were build to run RE2 and 3
[2:31:23] <astrofalcon1> direct is supposedly in a couple of weeks
[2:31:26] <Pookiedaexzile> There is
[2:31:27] <Arrowpoison1> That'd be rad.
[2:31:28] <%optimasmaximas> it's called the wii virtual console LUL
[2:31:29] <Coystick> I emulated Breath of Fire 4 once because you can't buy it legal fucking ANYWHERE
[2:31:29] <Daebunz> there is its called the wii U virtual console
[2:31:31] <astrofalcon1> here's to disappointment
[2:31:32] <%optimasmaximas> oh wait LUL
[2:31:32] <Azathotic> @heartlesshealer Actually yes, they use a built-in emulator
[2:31:33] <$spardanwarrior> Metroid Prime Trilogy was that.
[2:31:34] <Pookiedaexzile> It's called stealing
[2:31:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> HOLY SHIT, MORTAL SHELL OPEN BETA
[2:31:36] <CursedNobleman> Monkey Donkey with 32 colors?! PogChamp
[2:31:36] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the mario collection?

[2:31:44] <StaticSunrise> There is, it's called Dolphin
[2:31:47] <%LeiaSkynoober> Mario Chief Collection would be amazing
[2:31:53] <huskarl_zap> i MIGHT BUY THIS ONE
[2:31:54] <$spardanwarrior> Kirby had one too IIRC

[2:32:43] <astrofalcon1> LUL

[2:32:44] <%mike2hands> Got em
[2:32:45] <%PanicSwytch> Pay attention to the twitter name
[2:32:49] <bigshedman> Do it anyway LUL
[2:32:52] <Arrowpoison1> The timing on that would have been perfect given the reception to the new one.
[2:32:52] <%SmokerWest> Do the bit tho
[2:32:53] <@SoFarFetched> there goes your bit
[2:32:54] <%worldbrand> fuck we shouldn't have told him im so sorry chat
[2:32:54] <mistspade> Shit we fucked up.
[2:32:54] <CursedNobleman> aww, youll find something else to mock him about
[2:32:58] <%heartlesshealer> Good you found out now multiple days before the podcast LUL
[2:32:58] <Aydarkzero> i'm sure you'll come up with something new LUL
[2:32:58] <+Javaa01> Yeah the twitter handle wasn't even CLOSE to being real
[2:32:58] <%BinaryFireball> we wont tell
[2:33:00] <%BinaryFireball> do it anyways
[2:33:00] <+Remery_> You can still neg it
[2:33:01] <%Cozy90> make fun of him for SNOOF hell know what it means
[2:33:01] <%Typhaeon> I loved TTYD, but I lost it and my GameCube in a fire
[2:33:01] <%WhereIsWill> there was a bit here.....its gone now
[2:33:02] <%possumwalsh1221> Just like paper Mario LUL
[2:33:02] <%angel949> Always check the @ folks
[2:33:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Nintendo will literally die if they make too much money
[2:33:05] <+Javaa01> It was the easiest to spot fake
[2:33:07] <%floralkami> instead, Nintendo wants to abandon all its roots of bringing back good games and having ports to run its previous console games...
[2:33:08] <Shwepie> Just ask him about the tournament arc instead, that'll get you like two to three hours of content.
[2:33:10] <Pookiedaexzile> You can still do it with the context
[2:33:10] <%Typhaeon> Guess I'm paying out the nose for it
[2:33:10] <%miguelrod777> pat you dumb
[2:33:13] <%PanicSwytch> Does Woolie know its fake?
[2:33:17] <nesbitt22> Workshop the bit anyway
[2:33:19] <%Invlux> good thing you learned about it here instead of making a fool of yourself on the podcast Kappa
[2:33:23] <%FusRoDom> People who pull that shit on twitter need an IP ban or some shit. The same thing happened in April with God of War. I can't keep getting hurt like this :(
[2:33:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> clickbaited
[2:33:31] <%Joustar_> Gotta love the attention to detail from that account adding the white "verified" circle LUL
[2:33:36] <%optimasmaximas> @PanicSwytch i think that's why woolie said "lol" when he quote tweted it
[2:33:38] <%arcielardor> gold key was to your left
[2:33:39] <Pookiedaexzile> No Woolie doesn't know everyone should message him to make sure
[2:33:46] <CursedNobleman> Paper Mario Origami King does not have EXP! Also, gameplay footage tomorrow.
[2:33:52] <+OwlLightningMage> I would buy a ton of old Nintendo if they actually fucking would let me
[2:33:55] <%Cozy90> Tell Woolie to SNOOF old wrestling uniforms. He'll know what it means.
[2:33:57] <%ssjklyco> Was gonna joke he should play more games to get rereleased on switch, since W101 and Tokyo Mirage did, but that combo is broken
[2:33:58] <%optimasmaximas> @FusRoDom learn to check @s
[2:34:05] <+GeneralHysterics> "origamo"
[2:34:11] <keatiestofthegribbles> the former president of nintendo owned the mariners as a joke
[2:34:13] <astrofalcon1> yep ResidentSleeper
[2:34:14] <%Invlux> That's not even an RPG then???
[2:34:16] <%optimasmaximas> @FusRoDom been around for years with people like barry mccockiner
[2:34:16] <%Fien111> Third time's the charm.....sticker
[2:34:19] <penitentpentwitch> TTYD is basically the "Black Jack and Hookers" of Mario games. All but NSFW as far as 'family friendly' is concerned. Nintendo can't bury it fast enough.
[2:34:20] <+GeneralHysterics> theme of genius kojumbo
[2:34:21] <CursedNobleman> Marryo
[2:34:23] <%ssjklyco> Money is experience. See dark souls
[2:34:27] <TheTakkster> Apparently coins = experience in origamo
[2:34:27] <OlavOlavsson> paper orgasmo
[2:34:30] <huskarl_zap> Did pat finish GROM? SMOrc
[2:34:31] <%delilah4you> I'm hoping the coins act as experience, where you buy levels or soemething
[2:34:32] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:34:37] <+sizableidiot> arent you using coins to upgrade instead...no difference
[2:34:38] <Sunstalker> Okay coomer kinamaHappyW
[2:34:39] <%optimasmaximas> kojumbo is ALWAYS funny
[2:34:40] <+Orangeoff> fraud coward
[2:34:40] <@SoFarFetched> Shiggie Nintendamoto.
[2:34:40] <Ner234> LUL
[2:34:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Mario and the Oregano King-ah.
[2:34:41] <%1matheuw> genius patumbo
[2:34:41] <%Deano8817> LUL
[2:34:42] <%optimasmaximas> PAT NO LUL
[2:34:42] <%Invlux> oh nooo
[2:34:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Y'know, Monster Hunter doesn't have experience, does that mean it's worthless too?
[2:34:43] <+deviljhojho_> big brain kojambles
[2:34:43] <%FusRoDom> They're so convincing before you check the @ tho...
[2:34:43] <+GeneralHysterics> I love that, lmao. How did they respond?
[2:34:44] <+AntithesisEK> tensai kojimbles
[2:34:44] <%Fien111> I'm sure they love it
[2:34:45] <%possumwalsh1221> Gonna play it anyways cause I’m a pleb :)
[2:34:47] <ArkSeaside> i mean it's still probably more of an RPG than Indivisible
[2:34:47] <%SirGO0SE> me too LUL
[2:34:48] <+Javaa01> I mean, if you're gonna go with the wrong version of Origami, just say Oregano
[2:34:51] <bigshedman> What did they say in response? LUL
[2:34:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Norman Reedus will say that one day
[2:34:58] <FlashFrame> Did I walk in on crazy talk?
[2:34:58] <InvisibleMan101> every time you say origamo it reminds me of Heavy Rain
[2:35:00] <televisedrevolting> Shiggy McDiggy
[2:35:01] <+Remery_> Those employees are going to say that by accident and get fired
[2:35:04] <%ergulor> Vinny's nobunga is great
[2:35:06] <+deviljhojho_> "el oh el"
[2:35:15] <astrofalcon1> tbf they probably call him that every now and then
[2:35:16] <Aydarkzero> Kujumbo is forever his true name
[2:35:19] <+Froyuken> There's a Treehouse Live tomorrow.
[2:35:19] <Daebunz> origami king looks good so far though. previews mention puzzle wheel combat good and praised writing and exploration
[2:35:23] <Daebunz> despite being different
[2:35:25] <EASrake> Not "el you el"?
[2:35:27] <+Tacowavable> Genius Kojumbo is still amazing
[2:35:32] <%SirGO0SE> thanks nobunga
[2:35:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt was this game made to be like an old doom or quake game or does it just happen to be that style
[2:35:35] <Daebunz> its like 80% what i want and thats close enough
[2:35:42] <%Promessa_EX> 草
[2:35:44] <FlashFrame> so, is this like the new Hexen?
[2:35:44] <+Toughgoing> What would you say to Genius Kojumbo if you met him in person?
[2:35:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh nu, da Origayme Killah be all up in mah kids bidness.
[2:35:46] <ArkSeaside> Andrew Hulshult does good work
[2:35:46] <Coystick> Andrew
[2:35:48] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat When are you gonna do VR stuff?
[2:35:50] <+GeneralHysterics> I bet there's two factions in kojipro: Those who take themselves super seriously and hate the kojumbo meme and those who love it.
[2:35:52] <%Promessa_EX> They said grass
[2:35:56] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> has pat ever streamed minecraft?
[2:36:02] <%Fien111> "Guns"
[2:36:05] <astrofalcon1> @Daebunz yeah it still looks fun, if anything i like them trying stuff out
[2:36:06] <%Cozy90> wow :)
[2:36:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Genius Kojimbo sounds like a 70s anime about a samurai who fights with his smarts
[2:36:21] <Coystick> Game.....design?
[2:36:21] <ArkSeaside> i mean cmon yeah theyre guns
[2:36:21] <%SirGO0SE> haha staff go BANG BANG BANG
[2:36:38] <%possumwalsh1221> Haha sword go SHOOT
[2:36:39] <+Javaa01> But it's slow to track, so it's not a crutch for enemies that move side to side quickly
[2:36:41] <%tusk102> i love how the enemies just shatter into pieces @PatStaresAt
[2:36:50] <keatiestofthegribbles> you know what needs the rehydrated treatment omikron
[2:36:55] <%floralkami> it's almost like there was some thought put into them instead of "bang bang"
[2:37:01] <Coystick> But Pat don't you feel regret for killing all those innocent floating eye demons?
[2:37:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Low Int wizard shit
[2:37:06] <+GeneralHysterics> the music is nice
[2:37:12] <%tusk102> pft
[2:37:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> these are some quake ass sound effects
[2:37:22] <OlavOlavsson> who would play omikron man in the remake

[2:37:35] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Play Blood with a controller you coward!
[2:37:37] <%YakumoYomi> @arcielardor @SaltkeyAndAckfish Let's cut out the middleman, and get him to stream VR Minecraft
[2:37:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt wow the omikron remake looks great Kappa
[2:37:49] <%Cozy90> imagine if they made a hexen in the style of doom 2016
[2:38:06] <MafiaTweek> it wasn't the outside of doom
[2:38:08] <%crimsonharvest> will there be doom 1 and 2 references in here?

[2:44:45] <%DukeMoose> being able to Riff off your chat certainly gives you a lot of group confidence

[2:45:10] <ArkSeaside> there's that bit back in the Eternal Darkness LP where you talk about this sorta thing never working, which is hilarious
[2:45:12] <%StarlingSilence> time isnt real and neither are schedules
[2:45:14] <+MidnightBurst12> embrace the cringe
[2:45:15] <%Cozy90> :O
[2:45:17] <hat_under_bread> I miss having well-edited playthroughs, but I guess that's been shopped out to the community.
[2:45:17] <+Jaysky> BFG?
[2:45:18] <%possumwalsh1221> TwitchBoiStaresAt
[2:45:19] <InvisibleMan101> magic ribbon candy
[2:45:19] <+OwlLightningMage> The schedule are lies
[2:45:20] <%DappercatEsquire> The schedule is just to give the illusion of order
[2:45:21] <Aydarkzero> screen wipe!
[2:45:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paige: "Schedule? "
[2:45:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Now Beg us to pay, and Call us broke if we don;t
[2:45:22] <+GeneralHysterics> ya like purple, twitch boy?
[2:45:25] <Finakala> Soul Mode Aeternum is some real shit
[2:45:27] <+GeneralHysterics> we got purple
[2:45:27] <karovus> youre the reason i started watching streamers because i wanted to keep following you
[2:45:28] <ArkSeaside> that is exactly what that is
[2:45:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bless this weapon Kreygasm
[2:45:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> we killing people with ribbon candy?
[2:45:31] <%worldbrand> i'm all for "fuck professionalism" but not when there's a 1:1 overlap with convenience. schedules are kinda that
[2:45:33] <theshillman> that's a BFG alright
[2:45:34] <Herb_guy> I think you've done well you just reset your skill set
[2:45:34] <TheTakkster> Twitch boy in man pants
[2:45:37] <%emperordread> The man sniffing his piss stained cat while in his pyjamas is wondering if he is no longer anxious as fuck. I reckon you're doing just fine
[2:45:38] <%Bluwizard21> Bluwizard21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! this looks so heretic its not even funny. like disney meets heretic
[2:45:40] <%l3sovikk> The BFG can use the soul game for more gun
[2:45:41] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> I remember that Mercenary Kings video having no audio
[2:45:42] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt when you get the chance use the soul mode for the aeturnum
[2:45:42] <+Jaysky> Stop hitting yourself
[2:45:44] <%SmokerWest> I like this game, It's like Quake but SHINY
[2:45:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, now use that weapon on Soul mode LUL
[2:45:52] <%SirGO0SE> PatStaresAt schedule reminder, always ignore the first schedule.
[2:45:52] <+Javaa01> And remember, this BFG can be juiced with the soul mode alt fire
[2:45:53] <%Cozy90> better than TWITCH MAN IN BOY PANTS
[2:45:55] <%Typhaeon> What is THAT thing's alt fire?
[2:45:56] <ArkSeaside> use the soul power mode shot at your feet to get an achievement
[2:45:56] <+Froyuken> Or Hexen.
[2:45:59] <keatiestofthegribbles> the fuck am i looking at half the time

[2:47:24] <%Valdorick> Sometimes
[2:47:25] <ArkSeaside> heretic 2 was alright

[2:47:30] <%SomeSageAdvice> hell no lol, i just catch it whenever
[2:47:30] <%DukeMoose> WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO DO NOW?!?!
[2:47:30] <%FusRoDom> Annoyance, but it makes for a decent inside joke
[2:47:31] <Sundaysmiles01> not really, either I catch it or I dont
[2:47:31] <%possumwalsh1221> Maybe :)
[2:47:31] <%Joustar_> N-no
[2:47:32] <shitter_pounder_69> the domain name for the game is *** even
[2:47:32] <+deviljhojho_> I just like consistency is all
[2:47:33] <karovus> if your schedule works with ours its great
[2:47:33] <+Jaysky> Our existence is weird
[2:47:33] <Mister_McDerp> I have nothing better to do
[2:47:34] <CursedNobleman> a little.
[2:47:34] <Pookiedaexzile> When Civvie and Pat gonna link up like Pac and Dog
[2:47:36] <JackalKing> How can you plan around a stream that has no schedule?
[2:47:36] <%Fien111> It ruins my entire week you monster
[2:47:36] <%azure22900> YES so screw you when you make changes!
[2:47:36] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt in the summer, I am. because joblessness
[2:47:37] <%WhereIsWill> nah not really
[2:47:37] <madskull456> no but it reminds me to check twitch
[2:47:37] <%floralkami> no, but yes
[2:47:37] <%Typhaeon> Sorta
[2:47:38] <+Froyuken> Hey, got nothing else better to do than stay inside.
[2:47:39] <+BigDumBeak> I like when the lady is here most and you yell at her
[2:47:39] <InvisibleMan101> no but it would help
[2:47:40] <Aydarkzero> i mean what ELSE are you going to do this year
[2:47:40] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Depends on what you are streaming
[2:47:41] <+A0N33> It's nice to know what you're streaming, even if it's just a rough guess
[2:47:41] <%l3sovikk> I look forward to coming home from work to watch your streams.
[2:47:41] <+Javaa01> It is when the time difference is like 10 hours
[2:47:42] <+rei0> it's easier to know who to watch actually
[2:47:43] <$spardanwarrior> Do we really have anything else to do?
[2:47:43] <%Spydurman> sometimes
[2:47:43] <%maenos2> i do but i'm still recovering from my stroke so my days are kinda free form as is
[2:47:44] <TrashbagZombie> No, but I have nothing better to do
[2:47:45] <@SoFarFetched> I got nothing else going on right now, so these streams are my only events for the day LUL
[2:47:46] <Profmcstevie> Don't undersell yourself to justify your shitty schedule Pat usedV
[2:47:47] <$lotharrio> No, I plan my quarantine days around Woolie's streams. Because I know when they happen.
[2:47:48] <%pectusumbra> A little. Reminder: The world IS on fire right now and I work long early hours
[2:47:49] <%BinaryFireball> No BUT, when covid is over please move your timeslot later so I can actually watch you
[2:47:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hey man, when Woolie plays TTYD all other shit can fuck off
[2:47:50] <+Remery_> Sometimes the world sucks right now
[2:47:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Bitch I woke up late for Critcal Role
[2:47:51] <%Cozy90> Pat i have this week off. Most of the time im never here. I work nights normally.
[2:47:51] <%DappercatEsquire> It's an expectation, it's just kinda annoying, not gonna unsub because of it
[2:47:51] <+OwlLightningMage> You can't plan around something that you literally have never stuck too LUL
[2:47:54] <+GeneralHysterics> "this the ocd gang" damn the callouts
[2:47:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah, you’re good. You schedule however you want
[2:47:55] <%possumwalsh1221> WE ARE AT HOME ALL DAY PAT TWITCHBOI
[2:47:56] <%SummonerMagno> no, but consistency is nice
[2:47:57] <%delilah4you> Nah, its just nice to know when you go live so I can have some good background noise while I farm out PLD, the SHITTIEST CLASS STORY EVER
[2:47:58] <+Remery_> I can't do shit
[2:47:58] <ArkSeaside> I'm not sure how Civvie is with live content
[2:48:00] <+ZoltanBMagnus> kinda with the current climate
[2:48:01] <%Invlux> It's useful to know ahead of time, but mostly I just roll in when I see the notif
[2:48:05] <Finakala> Civvie/Pat/HanaMacchia boomer shooter collab
[2:48:10] <Coystick> Pat WE ARE SHELTERING IN PLACE
[2:48:10] <+Jaysky> Like your toilet seat
[2:48:11] <+Froyuken> You're stuck to your cube.
[2:48:12] <%ssjklyco> Your couch
[2:48:13] <alejandrogccs> you wanna hear something weird? Mike Ross is streaming
[2:48:13] <%PanicSwytch> I have only 2 other backup streams to watch incase u don't
[2:48:16] <%FusRoDom> Yeah Pat sticks to his couch
[2:48:17] <%angel949> stuck to paige heyoo
[2:48:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yeah right
[2:48:19] <%Ninestempest> peach doesn't count
[2:48:19] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Hi Pat, just a quick question but did you turn RTX on for the stream or is it automatically on when you start the game?
[2:48:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh you stuck to something all right
[2:48:23] <Sunstalker> You've stuck to your couch
[2:48:24] <%thegreenbenis> That Deadly premonition game has the worst framerate I have ever seen in my life.
[2:48:25] <Camail> yea you stick your ass to the seat
[2:48:26] <%Cozy90> sometimes his balls stick to his leg
[2:48:27] <Giztech> i work while you stream, so i get to entertain myself while work at home
[2:48:29] <%WhereIsWill> im simple man, i see you live, i am here
[2:48:31] <%crimsonharvest> as a fellow bitch-outer, i bitch out constantly so you doing it is no problem
[2:48:32] <ArkSeaside> like the couch haha nailed it
[2:48:37] <%vectorless_peon> i mean we have to show up to watch it
[2:48:37] <%optimasmaximas> hold on
[2:48:39] <%SirGO0SE> imagine a cube but for your toilet
[2:48:39] <%walternatorz> honestly, I can handle the inconsistent schedule, but there's always a moment of dissapointment when I find out the stream is canceled that day
[2:48:41] <%Invlux> LUL
[2:48:43] <CptHarlok> ... Why is your couch sticky?
[2:48:43] <%optimasmaximas> ask paighe to talk and find out
[2:48:44] <+Jaysky> That text seems pretty difficult to read
[2:48:45] <+OwlLightningMage> We all know that you don't plan for YOUR toilet Pat.
[2:48:45] <mistermastergreg> @thegreenbenis good
[2:48:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You need to opt for the Beta for RTX
[2:48:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> RTX ON (?)
[2:48:48] <+Remery_> World sucks, hours getting cut, only play video games and watch angry boomer dab
[2:48:50] <MafiaTweek> i think you gotta opt in to like a RTX beta on steam to do it
[2:48:50] <+Jaysky> Is that just me?
[2:48:55] <%possumwalsh1221> Good I hope Deadly P 2 caps at like 4 FPS LUL
[2:48:59] <+Froyuken> @thegreenbenis Worse than Perfect Dark 64 after several explosion effects?
[2:49:00] <%tinyswampthing> or paige
[2:49:08] <Finakala> I like the days when Pat ISN'T streaming because it means I can catch up on watching shows or playing games instead :>
[2:49:09] <+Javaa01> RTX is in the beta branch right now I think
[2:49:11] <+GeneralHysterics> they just call it that, lol
[2:49:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Hours getting cut squad represent
[2:49:18] <ArkSeaside> it took me a hot minute to realize the weapons are sprites
[2:49:20] <%thegreenbenis> @Froyuken We'll I've never actually seen that.
[2:49:20] <Herb_guy> Left handed weapons are for sinners
[2:49:20] <Shwepie> What ever happened to the cube? I haven't seen you fully cube up in forever.
[2:49:22] <+Javaa01> So you need to select it manually right now
[2:49:25] <shitter_pounder_69> god i hope pat streams ion fury too
[2:49:26] <CappuccinoGuil> The Dusk reveal trailer says: Rampage past Rednecks, Be branded a Heretic, Quake in fear, meet your Doom. They know LUL

[2:49:47] <+GeneralHysterics> It's great

[2:51:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait amazon won't ship them
[2:51:56] <+Froyuken> @thegreenbenis Must've been the 360 version.
[2:51:57] <+soundcloud_raptor> canada 2020, easier to order weed than red bull
[2:52:01] <+Remery_> As a Amazon worker those things always spill out the box
[2:52:02] <%trekkie11041> the zero ultras taste so good
[2:52:04] <cascadepersona> @ltsurge Please look forward to this update in October of 2020.
[2:52:09] <%ssjklyco> Bug Monster social media
[2:52:09] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't get how you caffine people live
[2:52:09] <Kerplunkers_> i live like 2 minutes from a store that has them but they cost nearly 3 dollars here
[2:52:19] <%thegreenbenis> Order a literal pallet of Monster energy zero ultra.
[2:52:20] <%crimsonharvest> that said i've really liked having black tea and a toke instead of monster
[2:52:23] <%Invlux> Remember that Pat started drinking monster again bc of Death Stranding
[2:52:35] <+Jaysky> On caffeine OwlLightningMage
[2:52:35] <%DukeMoose> a can at a time
[2:52:39] <+Froyuken> Turn the pallet sideways?
[2:52:40] <+GeneralHysterics> modern problems require modern solutions
[2:52:40] <%warmnoid> product placement works
[2:52:43] <%Cozy90> disasemble the pallet you goober
[2:52:43] <%possumwalsh1221> Not with that attitude
[2:52:43] <%crimsonharvest> they're portable man one at a time once the palletes on the property
[2:52:43] <%LtSurge> Could you get a friend going to stores to pick some up and leave them outside for you? @patstaresat
[2:52:44] <%pectusumbra> Man, as a magic mark, these weapons are cool
[2:52:45] <Gallhint> Pallets arent that big lmao
[2:52:46] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Take it off the pallet when it gets there.
[2:52:47] <cascadepersona> Death Stranding truly a life-changing game.
[2:52:47] <%trekkie11041> NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE
[2:52:49] <%Joustar_> Just try harder
[2:52:49] <Brainworm205> break the pallet down you big turkey
[2:52:50] <CursedNobleman> @Invlux DansGame
[2:52:50] <%Fien111> Relive your grocery days and break down the pallet to your house storage
[2:52:50] <%walternatorz> you worked in grocery, break down the pallet outside
[2:52:52] <BluBox> Guess you don't want it bad enough then
[2:52:53] <%Spydurman> just break down the pallet
[2:52:54] <ArkSeaside> Star Of Torment is best shotgun fight me
[2:52:58] <Gallhint> Didn't you work in a grocery store?
[2:52:58] <%floralkami> @soundcloud_raptor to be fair, weed dispensaries probably treat their delivery people much better than say, Amazon
[2:53:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt wait how often do you take the weeds? I got some drops during the quarantine because my anxiety had turned my sleep into 3 hours during the night and 3 hours during the day. I took them for a week to reset the sleep, it worked well. I still keep them should a similar emergency come up. Anxiety is still high though, so I've cut caffeine and alcohol completely.
[2:53:03] <%Cozy90> TAKE IT OFF THE PALLET PAT
[2:53:04] <おおおんな> you just need to drink them all immediately then
[2:53:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Caffeine makes me feel big sick. I don't get how people live with it LUL
[2:53:06] <%thegreenbenis> Just break down the pallet.
[2:53:08] <Brainworm205> yea you worked in a grocery store lol
[2:53:12] <+Remery_> Have you learned nothing from dead by daylight?
[2:53:14] <+Javaa01> I think you need to go back towards the 3 crushers that are lined up
[2:53:14] <%crimsonharvest> pat you groceryman dont you know how to wrangle a pallet worth of drinks
[2:53:20] <%thegreenbenis> Take it off the pallet you silly billy. @PatStaresAt
[2:53:27] <%tolloponik> buy a vending machine
[2:53:30] <Pookiedaexzile> He be getting lit fam
[2:53:31] <%Promessa_EX> You should make a bunker just for palettes of monster
[2:53:31] <+GeneralHysterics> @ArkSeaside have you even looked at Doom eternal's SSG? MEATHOOK DUDE
[2:53:34] <+soundcloud_raptor> @floralkami oh no doubt
[2:53:37] <%albret__einstrong> albret__einstrong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! dig up stupid
[2:53:40] <Pookiedaexzile> folding up big leaf dem
[2:53:40] <%crimsonharvest> a vending machine would be fun tbh
[2:53:41] <%Czar_Kazem> caffeine's started making my neck hurt and that blows
[2:53:46] <%Fien111> Wait, no. Pat was a bagger. He can't handle live load
[2:53:47] <bwongdraws> you just have to be encumbered and bring em in
[2:53:50] <cascadepersona> I've just been staying up till like 3 a.m. playing RPGs and Fighting games: A Deadly combination.
[2:53:52] <%Joustar_> Just buy the pallet Pat. Give that boxcutter collection some use
[2:53:53] <Finakala> Eternal's SSG is so nice
[2:53:54] <%bluefooddye1> when are you going to add BBTV emotes? @PatStaresAt
[2:53:55] <+GeneralHysterics> Star of torment is a contender, don't get me wrong. Best shotgun is a highly contended title
[2:54:03] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat if you got Postmates, you can get them from 7-11 and other places.
[2:54:05] <bwongdraws> btw hi pat! finally catching a stream instead of all the VODS
[2:54:15] <keatiestofthegribbles> this music is solid
[2:54:29] <ArkSeaside> the HL2 Rebar effect is the cinch for me
[2:54:36] <+Javaa01> The other one blew up
[2:54:38] <Wan6Saber> solid athM
[2:54:38] <%TheotherKristian> Play with Gyro controls
[2:54:40] <%walternatorz> if pat buys the pallet, he will build a throne of monster
[2:54:44] <+GeneralHysterics> good work strafing those projectiles. They are known to home in like piss
[2:54:49] <keatiestofthegribbles> is there a fov slider?
[2:54:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Postmates get bought by Uber Eats. Prepare for Postmates to become super garbage
[2:54:58] <%rosabellamelantha> Oh THIS room
[2:55:00] <ArkSeaside> i did that with Kraft Dinner cases
[2:55:00] <%thegreenbenis> Recommend any coffee brands?
[2:55:03] <bwongdraws> music is like a themed banger, gets the dramatic effect
[2:55:16] <+Javaa01> So this is where the magic behind the 0.5 A presses happens
[2:55:20] <%pectusumbra> hshshsh. Later fuckers
[2:55:41] <+GeneralHysterics> it's so brutal to see those dudes get pinned. I love it
[2:55:41] <ThatGuyThere03> oh god are half A presses still a thing
[2:55:41] <%rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this is the same composer as the dusk soundtrackbtw
[2:55:41] <stardustcrusad3r> folgers pretty good
[2:55:43] <+Trylorf> god this game kicks ass
[2:55:45] <bwongdraws> yeet them with the stick pat
[2:55:47] <+GeneralHysterics> LOL
[2:55:53] <keatiestofthegribbles> that mace is rad
[2:55:56] <ArkSeaside> goin vroom underwater with the soul axe is fun
[2:56:00] <+GeneralHysterics> savage
[2:56:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Question to the chat and pat how bad are monsters for you
[2:56:10] <ThatGuyThere03> don't all these retro FPS send-ups have the same composer?
[2:56:11] <+Trylorf> the mace is my favorite weapon, feels amazing
[2:56:13] <%WhereIsWill> gotta hit the nope button on that
[2:56:19] <penitentpentwitch> Dieticians know
[2:56:21] <%floralkami> nice
[2:56:21] <ThatGuyThere03> Monster is pretty bad for you
[2:56:21] <+OwlLightningMage> Monster is really bad for you
[2:56:24] <CursedNobleman> read the damn nutrition label LUL
[2:56:25] <%crimsonharvest> less bad than a similar volume of vodka lets go with that
[2:56:27] <$lotharrio> Not too bad. Just gotta keep them under the bed.
[2:56:27] <MafiaTweek> the low card blue monsters are the best ones in every way
[2:56:28] <%ssjklyco> Everything is bad. Coffee is bad as well
[2:56:28] <keatiestofthegribbles> that was a john romero trap right there
[2:56:28] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt but doesn't the caffeine affet your anxiety?
[2:56:29] <madskull456> pat was 10 feet tall before monster drinks
[2:56:30] <%Typhaeon> Bang is better
[2:56:30] <r90thunder> 24 of them in a 24 hour period is supposedly lethal
[2:56:35] <Pookiedaexzile> But the Pink ones taste good tho
[2:56:36] <+Toughgoing> In the end you are the real monster
[2:56:36] <bwongdraws> monster bad? but norman reedus drank so many in the Death Stranding
[2:56:38] <Sundaysmiles01> pretty sure you can feel it eating hours off your life
[2:56:39] <%WhereIsWill> everything in moderation chat
[2:56:40] <%bluefooddye1> you might get cancer, but who knows
[2:56:41] <%Promessa_EX> I think they give you kidney stones
[2:56:41] <%DukeMoose> i mean devildoggamer went to the hospital like 2-3 times because of monster
[2:56:42] <stardustcrusad3r> i thought you meant like fictional monsters
[2:56:42] <%Fien111> If it doesn't have Guarana it's fine. If it does triple the listed caffiene
[2:56:42] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Everything gives you cancer now though so it's whatever.
[2:56:47] <+GeneralHysterics> easy there descartes
[2:56:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Certainly not you!
[2:56:48] <%trekkie11041> 1 can never hurt anybody
[2:56:52] <%optimasmaximas> @r90thunder 24 of what?
[2:57:01] <Herb_guy> Monsters are always bad they eat children and dumb people hold up....
[2:57:04] <Davimotion96> Idk why but playing and looking at these kinds of games makes me motion sick, which is weird because I play Titanfall on the regular, but when I played Brutal Doom at a friend's house I almost threw up. Anyone else?
[2:57:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Can you buy pure guarana
[2:57:07] <penitentpentwitch> Ironically, the failure to deliver monster to you is probably making you live longer. Against your will.
[2:57:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Monster is pretty much like Emperor Time without the positives
[2:57:11] <r90thunder> 24 full-sized cans of monster
[2:57:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Shit seems lit
[2:57:30] <CursedNobleman> @Davimotion96 fps games be like that. i dont know if im more sensitive or if older games do it to me
[2:57:30] <%thegreenbenis> @Davimotion96 Might be the FOV.
[2:57:40] <+GeneralHysterics> reminiscent of the winter lanterns from bloodborne
[2:57:42] <Manwad> do you think the whole "everything gives you cancer" is because medical/bio tech makes it so nothing actually poisons/straight kills you anymore?
[2:57:45] <+Javaa01> @Davimotion96 That's a you problem, crank up the FOV and see if that helps, if it doesn't, then your body just sucks I guess
[2:57:46] <Kerplunkers_> i get really sick playing half life 2 and portal unfortunately
[2:57:47] <SocialMisfitGamer> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:57:51] <%crimsonharvest> FOV and distance from the screen massively affect whether or not you get motion sick
[2:57:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Davimotion96 FOV and the bobbing might b it
[2:58:01] <keatiestofthegribbles> remember kids energys are filled with taurine with is bull jizz
[2:58:01] <%DukeMoose> 98percent kills?!
[2:58:02] <%DukeMoose> coward
[2:58:11] <clockworknate> gravol!
[2:58:14] <%thegreenbenis> Fov lower then about 85 actually makes me wanna vomit.
[2:58:17] <Finakala> I know a girl who gets queasy from almost any FPS game, no matter what type
[2:58:19] <Kerplunkers_> dude our bodies are built to withstand substances, monsters wont kill you alone lol
[2:58:23] <+Jaysky> @Davimotion96 Happens to me too. Can't play OG Doom because of it and yet I'm completely fine playing Doom 2016
[2:58:26] <SocialMisfitGamer> lytLEERY Kill it
[2:58:29] <%crimsonharvest> thats a covid
[2:58:30] <%Fien111> Seriously, energy drinks are just SLIGHTLY more caffiene and sugar than a coffee and soda respectively. People need to chill out about them being a shotgun shell in a can
[2:58:30] <%floralkami> @manwad no, more like too much if anything is bad for you, no matter how strong medicine and science gets
[2:58:30] <%SmokerWest> WutFace WutFace
[2:58:32] <+GeneralHysterics> Isn't that a boss from recettear?
[2:58:35] <%WhereIsWill> D:
[2:58:38] <%delilah4you> Face! THE SCROUNGE!
[2:58:39] <%crimsonharvest> kill the huge covid
[2:58:42] <%Joustar_> that's one big covid
[2:58:44] <%DukeMoose> @keatiestofthegribbles thats called using every part of the buffalo. its economical
[2:58:47] <Pookiedaexzile> @keatiestofthegribbles Bitch maybe I'm trying to go moo
[2:58:50] <+OwlLightningMage> We're all technically cannibals since sugar has body parts in it
[2:58:53] <Kerplunkers_> if you die from an energy drink you were already supposed to die lol
[2:58:54] <%Fien111> I had someone on their 5th coffee of the day give me shit for one redbull
[2:58:55] <%crimsonharvest> youre gonna have to circle hop
[2:58:56] <filialpails> well that's just prime
[2:59:05] <%LeiaSkynoober> Hey btw, had anyone told Pat about the console KFC is apparently making?
[2:59:07] <Coystick> I have a 3 foot pyramid of about two dozen black coffee cans on my desk I call the "Bureau of Bloodshot"
[2:59:07] <%thegreenbenis> Circle hop
[2:59:11] <+GeneralHysterics> USE THE PURPLE
[2:59:16] <%delilah4you> Use your lisa lisa scarf
[2:59:16] <ArkSeaside> soul mode
[2:59:17] <%rosabellamelantha> Soul mode
[2:59:18] <%crimsonharvest> are you aiming for any specific points?
[2:59:22] <+Javaa01> Just pop the altfire and use the mace
[2:59:23] <+GeneralHysterics> oh that didn't help
[2:59:23] <%chainedwolfstress> @keatiestofthegribbles But taurine occurs naturally in the human body too? It's an amino acid.
[2:59:25] <+GeneralHysterics> oops
[2:59:32] <%Cozy90> hermit purple!
[2:59:32] <clockworknate> its not the caffeine thats the problem, its taurine and naicine etc...
[2:59:33] <%bluefooddye1> Shoot at it until it dies
[2:59:40] <+Froyuken> F
[2:59:41] <%rosabellamelantha> Soul mode dude
[2:59:41] <%chainedwolfstress> @keatiestofthegribbles Or was that japes & I am dumb?
[2:59:42] <%SmokerWest> Squish
[2:59:49] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT
[2:59:50] <+GeneralHysterics> I'll take blame for that one, lol
[2:59:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Lets try not straight back
[3:00:07] <%Fien111> Taurine's fine, it's just bile. Guarana is super caffiene so avoid that but most don't have it anymore
[3:00:13] <%SmokerWest> which color os health?
[3:00:13] <%Promessa_EX> Dies to a slime
[3:00:15] <filialpails> it jumps in straight lines, so zig-zag

[3:00:34] <alejandrogccs> i wanna hear Pat's estimate of how many seconds until the Ubi servers crash on sunday due to free Watch Dogs 2
[3:00:35] <%tolloponik> Just Like a metroid
[3:00:35] <%Cozy90> that was so much easier
[3:00:45] <%SvenHolgersson> SUPER EFFECTIVE
[3:00:45] <%LeiaSkynoober> Hey, Pat! Have you heard that KFC is apparently making a video game console? They posted a video on Twitter just the thought feels so weird to me.
[3:00:45] <%pectusumbra> special weakness?
[3:00:45] <+Toughgoing> It's sharp
[3:00:45] <%rosabellamelantha> because it's the best weapon in the game
[3:00:46] <gollygee> LULW

[3:01:01] <%rosabellamelantha> No it's just the best weapon in the game
[3:01:02] <+OwlLightningMage> It was clearly a Dragon type
[3:01:02] <%devanmuse> is it megaman rules? every boss has one weapon they melt to?
[3:01:02] <+Javaa01> The mace with the alt fire popped just does obscene damage
[3:01:03] <%WhereIsWill> stunlocked shotgun dps?
[3:01:09] <%Daxalog> No. Its an OP wepon thats been nerfed
[3:01:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Icy go Bur

[3:27:27] <%dekkitout> "So anyways- I started swingin'..."

[3:28:09] <Kojixif> this is a really cool level
[3:28:10] <+sinistersally> Let me Axe you a question Axehole

[3:28:15] <Herb_guy> Do you think captain Planet is behind the virus...?
[3:28:15] <tales_911> There is a kind of BFG in this game

[3:33:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @bleugh unreal
[3:33:09] <%SirGO0SE> theyre likely reusing the exact same asset constantly so theyre recalling it and replacing them fast
[3:33:11] <%Wallabri> pet cat
[3:33:12] <@SoFarFetched> You take the cat with you and carry it as you grab the food,then bring them both back to your room so you can have the cat on your lap while you eat the food.
[3:33:15] <%CalderGaming> @generalve the game is right there in the stream title
[3:33:17] <%SirGO0SE> otherwise id think the draw distance would be further
[3:33:19] <+CarlosEoM> the cat is law
[3:33:23] <keatiestofthegribbles> its a feature not a bug - swery 65
[3:33:33] <T_Sasquatch> i honestly dont get deadly premonitions popularity as an actual game and not a meme
[3:33:33] <$Tuskor13> I love that leak of deadly premonition 2 having like 20 fps and all the deadly premonition fans are like let's fucking gooooo
[3:33:58] <%Cozy90> ooooooo water.....

[3:36:16] <%delilah4you> So each weapon is a different element, the staff is water, the sword is wind, the trident is lightning, the planet shooter is fire, and the lisa lisa scarf is void
[3:36:20] <%SirGO0SE> isnt the saying never look before you leap? Kappa
[3:36:20] <suddenlyscorched> It was a really cool thing
[3:36:20] <%dasmause> ive beaten the game and i still dont get how aeternum works and what determines what it hits and what it doesnt

[3:38:51] <+Javaa01> Because it's a screen space reflection
[3:38:53] <%BinaryFireball> reminds me of the aztec sports arena
[3:39:03] <+Javaa01> If it's not in your direct view, it can't be reflected
[3:39:04] <%BinaryFireball> where they played murderball
[3:39:05] <%heartlesshealer> Back from grocery run after Cardi B - Cardi O joke. How's our favorite Stumbo doing?
[3:39:12] <+Gamblitz> it's show "A" surface
[3:39:21] <MafiaTweek> more fps should have enemies fly and impaled wildly into walls
[3:39:41] <%dekkitout> The one ball game where if you lose, your life is forfeit for the sun god- we need those games nowadays....
[3:39:42] <%thegreenbenis> @keatiestofthegribbles I had someone spray me up the nose with one of those with a fully charge backpack super soaker and that made me straight up throw up. It was so badass, I got one too

[3:39:45] <%Cozy90> dude the Super Soaker CPS 2000 was the best super soaker to ever exist. i rmeember i had one. they dont make em like that anymore
[3:40:02] <%BeezusHrist> getting out of the water in doom eternal is the WORST
[3:40:14] <+Javaa01> But yeah, you need to go back to where you were and use that gold key button
[3:40:34] <+Rekinsinn> is this game good?
[3:40:54] <+Javaa01> You already have full green ammo anyways, so getting that wouldn't even do anything
[3:40:56] <%tallik44123> it is
[3:40:57] <keatiestofthegribbles> the pain i dished out that day left a few scars
[3:40:58] <%dasmause> you cant anymore, you had to use the block you dropped
[3:40:59] <%Cozy90> @Rekinsinn i liek it SeemsGood
[3:41:04] <+Remery_> idk but it makes me hungry for ice cream
[3:41:29] <+Javaa01> You just have to press the button on the wall
[3:41:35] <%dasmause> @Javaa01 its not just green mana, its mana boost that gives you all mana types
[3:41:41] <+Javaa01> You do tho
[3:41:47] <%heartlesshealer> delicious crystallized nutrient
[3:41:48] <$spleekle> I want to know where da gold at
[3:41:50] <+Gamblitz> this game needs that half life 1 boid flocking tech
[3:41:58] <Something_Original_> you accidently fell in there earlier and picked it up w/o realising
[3:42:05] <+Javaa01> You got it when you accidentally fell into that hole the first time around
[3:42:06] <+Rekinsinn> I love 4th gen (HD) aesthetics
[3:42:22] <TrashbagZombie> Pat stumbles into victory once more

[3:43:36] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat i think paige could out run a horse if it was a race to McDonald's or Skeletons
[3:43:55] <mikesapartment> which serious sam is this
[3:43:55] <+Gamblitz> need more jovavitch
[3:44:35] <%Pyroclase> what is Paige WAS a horse?
[3:44:36] <Daebunz> have you tried
[3:44:41] <%IncredibleMeh> but could she be motivated to become faster?
[3:44:42] <%Totally_not_toby> paige cant outrun piage
[3:44:45] <%devanmuse> it depends on the horse
[3:44:46] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> what if its a super lame horse
[3:44:49] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt Ever seen that creepy video of the girl who runs like a horse?
[3:44:49] <karovus> but madanold tho
[3:44:52] <+JVolfram> What if it abducted Elmo?
[3:44:54] <%KaiserMario> What if it was a 3-legged horse?
[3:44:55] <%heartlesshealer> And no, spiders won't make Paige faster. She'll just sit still and scream at you
[3:44:56] <+Remery_> past paige?
[3:44:57] <%cowardlord> we should test this
[3:44:57] <%SGrim> Horses top at at 55 mph. The land-speed record for a human is 28. It's no contest.
[3:45:03] <+Remery_> future paige?
[3:45:04] <%walternatorz> can paige swim faster than she can run?
[3:45:04] <%Cozy90> can paige outrun you?
[3:45:07] <%emperordread> But who would win in a fight? Paige or horse
[3:45:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige wins
[3:45:12] <%dekkitout> I think the onverunder on her out running a horse for the right thing is 3 or 7
[3:45:16] <Sunstalker> What if you threathe her with shadow puzzles though?
[3:45:17] <+Gamblitz> as Freeman minds succinctly pits it. it's legs are longer
[3:45:22] <unclekulikov> Hit th ejump!
[3:45:26] <%DukeBlack_> like real life
[3:45:27] <+Remery_> But that's like real life
[3:45:31] <Finakala> Common problem in FPS to be fair
[3:45:33] <T_Sasquatch> sucks chode LUL
[3:45:37] <%Townspoon> What if Paige is RIDING the horse and sticks her arm out in front of the horse - wins all races!
[3:45:37] <%cowardlord> What if the horse is as broken as paige?
[3:45:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> faster then a speeding wheelchair more powerful then a small kitten capable of half way leaping pat in a single bound! ITS PAIGE!
[3:45:39] <%Cozy90> hahahahahah
[3:45:39] <%heartlesshealer> LUL

[3:46:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> I thought you were pat
[3:46:08] <+Remery_> that jump looked really floaty
[3:46:09] <%dekkitout> I look forward to "Go to hell" being replaced with "Go to 2020" in the near future SeriousSloth
[3:46:18] <%DappercatEsquire> push those buttons with your whole body
[3:46:25] <%tinyswampthing> long distance runners have beaten horses in a race but only becuase we are better at endurance
[3:46:42] <keatiestofthegribbles> i remember a time where i had a electric scooter and wiped out next to an amblance station where instead of helping me one of the drivers rushed over and said that looked sick
[3:46:43] <%asgard147> First Try! limesPat
[3:46:51] <%CalderGaming> does this game support strafejumping
[3:47:04] <T_Sasquatch> "We" is a very small population of the world

[3:48:34] <%AncelDeLambert> why is Pat's butt exuding purple fart gas right now?
[3:48:35] <%SaiyanShoto> poor paige
[3:48:40] <%Cozy90> do you handle alot of sweaty balls?
[3:48:40] <Sunstalker> Pat has the ballitis

[3:48:43] <+Remery_> like is your balls not getting any cooling?
[3:48:44] <%AncelDeLambert> is that the ball sweat fumes?

[3:49:18] <%WhereIsWill> but what about the 3rd nut
[3:49:19] <%SirGO0SE> what about ur baby nut
[3:49:21] <mutantlunchbox1> Jumping on platforms is sweaty work
[3:49:21] <%Shubreaker> it's got a lot of surface area for sweat
[3:49:23] <+Remery_> liquid cooling for your balls
[3:49:23] <$RealThiele> sample deez nutz
[3:49:25] <blksheepknt> came out of the walls
[3:49:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> aaaaaaaaaaaaan baby nut is stuck in my mind again
[3:49:37] <Lophostrix_> this game looks like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSS
[3:49:41] <+Gamblitz> your are breaking your reality, you need to hard reset it.
[3:49:42] <%Chichen> man, the sword sucks.
[3:49:53] <blksheepknt> what episode or map is this? I'm asking early game or late
[3:49:56] <keatiestofthegribbles> its the nut shack
[3:50:02] <T_Sasquatch> Or just wear better pants LUL, let your nuts hang literally
[3:50:05] <%asgard147> so how is this game by the way Pat? limesThink
[3:50:06] <keatiestofthegribbles> 3
[3:50:14] <Herb_guy> That was some Crash Bandicoot shit
[3:50:17] <%Chichen> @blksheepknt its the Sacred Path i believe.
[3:50:24] <StormingRLP> Well, when you combine heat, compression, and hair over a long period time you're going to end up with some sweaty balls. Its inevitable
[3:50:28] <+Remery_> just wear underwear that cools your balls
[3:50:34] <%TomFrancis_> this game looks really cool :)
[3:50:37] <+Remery_> some comfy boxers
[3:50:50] <+Remery_> maybe briefs
[3:50:58] <crossolead> This game is being a motherfucking sorcerer
[3:51:02] <%dekkitout> Or boxer-briefs
[3:51:10] <%Chichen> yes
[3:51:11] <%Chichen> or ice
[3:51:13] <%luftraumm1> use sunscreen
[3:51:15] <%Monkeyweed21> STICK YOUR DICK IN THE FAN PATRICK
[3:51:18] <%WhereIsWill> liquid cooled boxers Kreygasm
[3:51:18] <%miguelrod777> looser boxers
[3:51:20] <%RueOrin> Ah yes. Let's put a fan near your dick.
[3:51:21] <+JVolfram> Install fans on your dick
[3:51:22] <+Gamblitz> when bombus making boxers?
[3:51:23] <StormingRLP> Hair is supposed to do that either way but oh well.
[3:51:24] <T_Sasquatch> you dont want your balls too cool
[3:51:24] <%SvenHolgersson> Just put some ice in there like an adult
[3:51:29] <zer0enixx> This looks like speedrunner heaven
[3:51:29] <%luftraumm1> wash it with listerine
[3:51:30] <CursedNobleman> just expose yourself in front of an unguarded industrial fan
[3:51:31] <%Invlux> Pat's got that liquid cooled ball rig
[3:51:32] <karovus> yes
[3:51:33] <$Teh_Un> LUL
[3:51:34] <%Chichen> yes.
[3:51:35] <Ipsenscastle> just blow on them every two minutes, jeez
[3:51:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[3:51:38] <+Remery_> put your boxer briefs in the freezer
[3:51:40] <theshillman> liquid cool your balls
[3:51:40] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[3:51:40] <%dekkitout> You can put your dick in those dyson circle fans tho
[3:51:41] <%TomFrancis_> nothing better than air conditioning your balls on a hot day
[3:51:42] <%miguelrod777> yes
[3:51:43] <+Remery_> then put them on
[3:51:48] <%twistingt0rt0ise> That's the right answer.
[3:51:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Don't be stupid Pat. it uses dick cooling dust mites
[3:51:50] <mutantlunchbox1> bengay
[3:51:53] <$lotharrio> C'mon Pat! If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[3:51:54] <%Monkeyweed21> or get one of the dental ice packs and shove it down there
[3:51:56] <%heartlesshealer> damp towel
[3:51:58] <StormingRLP> Hair helps with spreading out the heat so it doesn't build up in on e area
[3:52:02] <Ipsenscastle> get them suckers liquid cooled
[3:52:08] <madskull456> pat would have to spend all day untangling it
[3:52:12] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait yeah, can't you just free-ball it? that should be cool
[3:52:16] <+Remery_> liquid cooling is awesome
[3:52:18] <blksheepknt> New gamer box 6900 with new 120mm punisher Ball fans!
[3:52:18] <+Elite_Tube> The ribbon candy
[3:52:19] <%Invlux> okay I know that was a joke I made but liquid cooling for balls actually sounds amazing
[3:52:26] <$Dakuu75> the fucking escalation chat does is amazing. "Get cooler-underwear like boxer-briefs", "just use ice", "STICK YOU DICK IN THE FAN!"
[3:52:37] <+rynfz> Second time will be different.
[3:52:44] <%miguelrod777> or don't wear PJs pants all the time wear shorts
[3:52:45] <%Monkeyweed21> isnt that just pissing yourself
[3:52:47] <%luftraumm1> use crazy straws with cool lemonade around your testicles
[3:52:48] <+rynfz> Just have to pull back faster than the fan.
[3:52:50] <%blastazoid26> is this medieval doom?
[3:52:54] <StormingRLP> Or you know, grow more hair XD
[3:53:02] <%delilah4you> these levels are REALLY long
[3:53:12] <$Tuskor13> I've been saying for years we need air conditioned boxers
[3:53:19] <%dekkitout> @Dakuu75 You forgot the part of "Get an air compressor with an elaborate rope-pulley system"
[3:53:22] <%cowardlord> Blue

[3:53:29] <%luftraumm1> this game doesn't seem as interestinf as dusk
[3:53:31] <Finakala> Yeah you can kinda tell that ep 1 and 2 were made a lot earleir
[3:53:33] <Ipsenscastle> oh, I forgot Pat had no pubic hair, yeah that might explain the sweat
[3:53:44] <%luftraumm1> poor fïsh
