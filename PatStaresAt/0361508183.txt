[0:04:16] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> cheer400 I love pat and his Grimy face! I thoroughly love this game and the community. What is your favorite class to start as?
[0:04:24] <%Fidel_Castbro> this last tier of the raid is definitely my favorite
[0:04:27] <DerpyHoovesFan> Angriest Pat? But where's Happy Pat?
[0:04:32] <Bailey__gaming> how many new birds are there for pat to grind since the last time he played anyway
[0:04:32] <Nordguy> aren't we only doing patch notes?
[0:04:39] <+Bad1uck> The new raid is an amazing meat grinder lubed with casual tears
[0:04:41] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Pat's taking ashit
[0:04:42] <%Fidel_Castbro> like they actually made all the bosses fun to fight even Ozma 2.0
[0:04:52] <%Ahack13> @Wauughlord I stopped playing hardcore in 4.3, came back for like 2 weeks in 4.4 to do msq and, primal and finish out omega. Have too many games to play right now or I'd jump back in to finish out the new stuff for this patch too lol.

Because I am not wildly in the know about it, but I have heard good things. Also, since my birthday is the day AFTER Kingdom Hearts 3 drops, I am geeked. Might stream it if you do not plan on it.

On a simillar note, you brought up Chatau Frontnac on the podcast; am i crazy for wanting a Hitman level or an action mvie to take place there? ThankU

[0:17:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 17m 21s.
[0:17:20] <cherpii> It's always best to go to events with friends for destressing IMO
[0:17:23] <%g0dhand9876> Then smash your GameCube controller
[0:17:23] <aeonicvector> @SSaryn knows whats up
[0:17:24] <vairland> Get drunk only for the dance/rave
[0:17:24] <%bigmuffpie> showering will make you the coolest
[0:17:25] <alamorn> Anyone have any tips for Tank Anxiety?
[0:17:25] <%ElenaManetta> But Pat, YOU don't shower
[0:17:26] <+zaworldo> oh sweet

[0:17:29] <krewl123> shit your pants so you can out stink the rest of them
[0:17:29] <%pimpinahz> hide your kids, hide your wives
[0:17:31] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> My console won't let me play this game at all for some stupid reason to do with it locking a mistake account to the system
[0:17:33] <%kiiiirsten> Pro tip: Also brush your teeth
[0:17:35] <+augurgewalt> how many redbulls did you have today already?
[0:17:38] <deadredeyez> I'm always Super full of adrenaline when I play at home so I'm sure to have a heart attack
[0:17:40] <mercado94> Assert your dominance with your smelly odor
[0:17:40] <+SWFanatic> pat is barely not in the shower
[0:17:40] <%GohanEgret> fuck that, establish dominance and smell like a sewer
[0:17:41] <TwentyCXII> Wipe your pits in the sink

[0:24:28] <%afronooch> Tactis
[0:24:30] <%OwlLightningMage> Tactics is really good
[0:24:31] <r_Foeburden87> Tactics, Tactice advannce, Mystic Quest
[0:24:32] <RipSlamsteak> revengeance?
[0:24:33] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Nah. It's all about Dirge of Cerberus
[0:24:35] <+other_badger> What about persona?
[0:24:35] <NoctisxMog> Dissidia
[0:24:36] <%TheTakkster> Tactics Advance
[0:24:37] <+future_famous_person> tack ticks
[0:24:37] <fluffy_sauce> Tactics is the best FF game
[0:24:38] <chaoscoolperson> @CarrotWhisky doesn't change this game from having a story that I did half of
[0:24:38] <%badchoice5> Rival the main game, and in a series where that means something
[0:24:42] <%laserbeaming> Tactics is Better than any mainline FF. It's crazy.
[0:24:42] <$ooblagis> Tactics doesn't rival the main game, it shits all over it
[0:24:44] <%cureneckbeard> tictacs
[0:24:45] <ArcticAsylum> New Vegas?
[0:24:46] <$OmegaWeltall> FFT is amazing... Tactics advanced is garbo
[0:24:47] <Captainahab_37> lightning returns was pretty bad, i reccomend it
[0:24:47] <Ugato> Tactics is my favorite game
[0:24:49] <%PauliusMaximus> what about persona, that rivals SMT pretty hard
[0:24:55] <Ugato> favorite final fantasy game*
[0:24:56] <+Mexrage> gameplay wise i prefer FFTA2, but FFT have better story, also Tactics Ogre is much better than FFT @AngriestPat
[0:24:56] <%CJett92> There's Bepis in the bottom left corner

[0:26:04] <ShoggothLord> Oh, oh god, what did I just say
[0:26:04] <Captainahab_37> Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead is cool its like DF adventure mode but less complez
[0:26:05] <deadredeyez> woolieVERGIN
[0:26:08] <%JGardner88> I actually really liked Lightning Returns, albeit I haven't played past anything before 12
[0:26:09] <InsomniacPersona> Waow

[0:26:14] <rufus2k2> oh no
[0:26:15] <KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat did you fight seiryu?
[0:26:16] <Captainahab_37> but DF adventure mode is the best
[0:26:19] <%Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid200 Happy Birthday Rose
[0:26:20] <%badchoice5> Dwarf Fortress has fun in it somewhere, I'm told, but there's too much content in the world that doesn't require arcane rituals to make fun
[0:26:23] <%cureneckbeard> nyannHmm
[0:26:24] <%mistermaybe> @okentucky hey thanks a ton man! Really appreciate it!
[0:26:26] <TheOneUpWarrior> Dat Beaaaaaard
[0:26:34] <+Iggle_Ohs> Dorf's biggest problem is its interface. I learned it well enough, but it's a big of a wall. And I can never play adventure mode without the keybinds cheatsheet in front of me.
[0:26:37] <alamorn> Day 1?
[0:26:38] <@SSaryn> And itll fail. probably.
[0:26:40] <ebonifragaria> Wait I just got back, is someone talking shit about Dwarf Fortress?! IT's amazing fukc you
[0:26:40] <$SGrim> YOU FOOL rooH
[0:26:40] <%einheri> if you like DF Adventure mode you might as well play Caves of Qud or something

[0:30:40] <sir_nack> oh man MMOs are confusing
[0:30:40] <ebonifragaria> How the fuck do you play an MMO on a controller, I never could get used to it
[0:30:40] <%spacekataz18> I prefer PLD and WAR but they messed with them DRK a lot
[0:30:42] <%PROUD2beGINGER> nobody blames you for stormblood
[0:30:43] <ReiDuran> PLD BIG DICK DPS
[0:30:45] <%Raxus_Secundus> What's up chat?

[0:30:47] <slyarvicle08> What is your favorite final fantasy? @AngriestPat
[0:30:48] <Peasant_0> Drk is cool just not that fun to play
[0:30:48] <daedri> Bloodspiller is sick as fuck though.
[0:30:50] <Cobaltor_252> I have no idea what's going on but it looks rad
[0:30:50] <bittahjuri> No but dark arts more tho
[0:30:52] <+TransporterX7> Was A DRK through Heavensward
[0:30:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> I prefer MNK, but Yoshi P doesn't jermaPluto
[0:30:53] <%Captainahab_37> WAR was my shit dude
[0:30:53] <g0zu> They're gonna get that Stormblood Paladin treatment
[0:30:58] <+Kriptin> I like samurai because me like damage.
[0:30:59] <%kamen_advent> How about them BUNNY GIRLS
[0:30:59] <RamenRiderZ> Shadowbringers gonna be Dark Knight city doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub
[0:31:00] <CarrotWhisky> Yeah, the dev team is aware of the DA-spam, and will rework DRK in 5.0.
[0:31:00] <%OwlLightningMage> I have no idea what's happening
[0:31:02] <%badchoice5> Wow it has been a loooong time since I've looked at a proper MMO
[0:31:04] <%Shadowthedigger> Yeah, weeb house!
[0:31:05] <%cherubsanonymous> Wow this UI is fucking abysmal
[0:31:09] <SailingSaturn> WAR is best Tank class cirSlain
[0:31:09] <+dracgeon> @ebonifragaria FFXIV is unique in that way
[0:31:09] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@rapture1990) (warning)
[0:31:10] <Idon__> FF6 da bes
[0:31:10] <Fynale> @AngriestPat your house is the same place that my fc's is
[0:31:13] <+InugamiTheHound> I don't know anything about final fantasy 14.
[0:31:14] <CarrotWhisky> @RamenRiderZ Just like how Stormblood were a MNK-expansion? Kappa
[0:31:14] <%PROUD2beGINGER> yeyeye
[0:31:15] <%g0dhand9876> Nioh online looks great
[0:31:15] <%LogothX> DRK got overwatch ed
[0:31:15] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Yeyeyeye, FFXIV

[0:31:17] <Dio_TR> Play LALAFEL Pat
[0:31:19] <%Fadedblank247> those "pants" are why pat sometimes tries to take his pepis out OVER his beltline. pajama pants train and betray you like that if u wear them everyday
[0:31:20] <%pimpinahz> PAT PAT!! Why you use controller?? WHY??
[0:31:20] <@SSaryn> MNK does NOT get to complain with its recent buff.
[0:31:21] <aeonicvector> Thats a funny way of saying Tactics advanced
[0:31:21] <%Nobrev> WAR and RDM are my absolute favorite classes in this game
[0:31:22] <RJMakdaddy> What's your favorite non MMO final fantasy
[0:31:23] <+TransporterX7> For real
[0:31:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> where's the birds?
[0:31:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Kingdom Hearts is his favorite FF
[0:31:30] <+TransporterX7> We are judging your DPS RIGHT NOW
[0:31:30] <%walternatorz> @AngriestPat did you ever play FFXI?
[0:31:30] <%ShiftyFish> I'd like to play RDM if I were to get into this.
[0:31:31] <haisho> oh hey Longsword Kappa
[0:31:32] <yves_is_online> @TheSpiritof2277 i see a fellow big brain in the chat jermaDafoe
[0:31:32] <+Tylermcd93> Yeah, the UI is pretty bad
[0:31:32] <%Harawanagangsta> where the fuck is fallout?
[0:31:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> apatCaw apatCaw
[0:31:36] <%Bladethrine> So question to chat in general, I started playing xiv on ps4 (whm) is there a way to switch targets better so I can damage in between healing?
[0:31:39] <+Zaver88> I one of those messed up people that don't like how to play PLD optimally.
[0:31:39] <%Captainahab_37> Kingdom Hearts MMO would be kinda cool
[0:31:41] <CarrotWhisky> @pimpinahz FFXIV is actually very well designed to use with a controller. Well, unless you are playing SCH/SMN.
[0:31:47] <+gurrren_lagannn> Can I play this MMO solo? @angriestpat
[0:31:47] <%skizzuto> I have no idea what the fuck is going on but it looks cool I guess
[0:31:50] <%Genis94> The UI is completely customizable. Dunno what problems you'd have when you can change just about everything.
[0:31:51] <%Captainahab_37> yknow, Toon Town
[0:31:51] <RamenRiderZ> @carrotwhisky oi, I played SB as both Monk and Sam
[0:31:51] <+zaworldo> WHAT IS EVEN HAPPNENING

[0:31:55] <+Sambin0> someone said the production value in this is better than wow, it doesnt look like it at all
[0:31:59] <Mnightshyamallama> @angriestpat why do you play on controller?
[0:32:00] <+Zaver88> I don't want to switch to Sword Oath while Main Tanking
[0:32:00] <2DSuperiority> Haven't finished ARR so this is super spoilers
[0:32:00] <yves_is_online> jermaJup1 jermaJup2
[0:32:01] <KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat did you finish four lords yet?
[0:32:03] <$Yakobro> LUL
[0:32:03] <+Sinister_Aglet> bruh
[0:32:04] <%laserbeaming> I wish I could play this game, there's no servers near me, I have 280 ms all the time.
[0:32:04] <%kamen_advent> UI could be cleaner and the early 2000s bevel glare to everything is annoying.
[0:32:04] <ReiDuran> PLD is piss easy
[0:32:05] <bittahjuri> tell Cog Nora says hey
[0:32:05] <deadredeyez> bruh
[0:32:05] <+Mleahy24> you playing this on pc or ps4?

[0:32:08] <+Bad1uck> lol PLD
[0:32:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 32m 10s.
[0:32:09] <%Ahack13> @Bladethrine Controller or keyboard?
[0:32:09] <mercado94> I got dizzy by just looking at the UI and the numbers all over the screen
[0:32:09] <%lizard0tm> That hud is pretty abysmal
[0:32:11] <Sanyle> the shade
[0:32:11] <Fynale> @Bladethrine you can set it to target only enemies or allies depending upon if your weapons holstered or not
[0:32:11] <JoeyDDT> PLD is baby mode
[0:32:13] <danemous> I played this game a bit. But hate subscription games so stopped
[0:32:15] <Basch71> how hard is 123 LuL
[0:32:15] <ebonifragaria> Pally = faceroll in FFXIV too? lmao
[0:32:18] <%RaikenTB> who dat wappy dog?

[0:32:19] <albedo455> BRUH D nut
[0:32:20] <ShoggothLord> Except in AD&D
[0:32:22] <%payterodactyl> what would you recommend to someone who has never played a FF game? I've never played a game but have recently gotten an interest. @angriestpat
[0:32:22] <@SSaryn> PLD is legitimately easier than WAR.
[0:32:24] <CarrotWhisky> BLM is easier I would say. Just harder to master though.
[0:32:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> [ CRAZY TALK ]
[0:32:29] <%Captainahab_37> This game actually controls real well with a controller
[0:32:32] <%Bladethrine> @ahack13 Controller
[0:32:33] <+Zaver88> I don't like Switching to Sword Oath
[0:32:33] <g0zu> Paladin difficulty is party cooldown synergies.
[0:32:33] <%lewdskeletor13> ResidentSleeper
[0:32:35] <%Fadedblank247> yeah BLM is pretty easy to just button spam
[0:32:36] <arcaderabbit48> PLD being so easy is why I swtiched over to WAR
[0:32:38] <%bonzosan> what?
[0:32:39] <+Zaver88> While Main tanking
[0:32:40] <AMajorTom> Buff your Mana
[0:32:41] <KaseKaizer> Paladin's are facerolls in every medium in which they exist
[0:32:44] <Fear_Ranjer> *Writes this down fast*
[0:32:44] <+dracgeon> hud is easier than main U
[0:32:44] <+Zaver88> I know how to play
[0:32:46] <haisho> you just slap shit until they're mad at you; BAM you're a Paladin
[0:32:51] <+combomaniadeluxe> as som4
[0:32:52] <Sanyle> I tried playing this on ps4 but backed out cause none of my friends could get into it lol
[0:32:52] <amavii> confusion befalls me
[0:32:54] <Psyramics> i press this button and then this button and then this button and then this button! Easy!
[0:32:57] <%Captainahab_37> Does DRK suck?
[0:32:58] <%cureneckbeard> Is this Runescape
[0:32:58] <+Bad1uck> Tank class difficulty: DRK > WAR > PLD
[0:32:58] <%kamen_advent> God FFXIV music is great
[0:32:59] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> I'm to nervous to play a tank or healer
[0:33:00] <EmptyEncore> WAR is definitely a more interesting tank option than PLD. How are the other tanks though?
[0:33:00] <InsomniacPersona> That's NOT easy.
[0:33:04] <%Captainahab_37> cause i want my WAR to be a DRK
[0:33:07] <+Zaver88> I didn't say it was hard.
[0:33:10] <RamenRiderZ> Hardest part of tanking are the other players
[0:33:11] <derekwst3> fake gamer
[0:33:11] <deadredeyez> looks cool
[0:33:15] <%Faustgesicht> paladins good shit
[0:33:16] <+dracgeon> these effects are amazing
[0:33:16] <%Caidezes> I have no idea what's happening.
[0:33:17] <aeonicvector> a macro can and will be your pally
[0:33:17] <+Zaver88> I don't like Switching to Sword Oath.
[0:33:18] <%GohanEgret> e a s y m o d e i s n o w a v a i l a b l e
[0:33:18] <%g0dhand9876> what
[0:33:21] <%Quigsies> As someone who has never played an MMO, this shit looks like legit fucking magic
[0:33:23] <%Squdnate> apatDab apatDab apatBig
[0:33:24] <RosELLo6> WHM main here; i have no idea how tanks work beyond what i need to know as a healer is that bad
[0:33:25] <+TransporterX7> dont forget to provoke
[0:33:27] <red_neinwun> what class is good for pure melee
[0:33:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wow, I never thought you could map an MMO hotbar to a controller, but I really dig how they do it here.
[0:33:29] <amavii> mmos are fucking mandarin to me
[0:33:31] <@SSaryn> Man I love the what's coming out of everyone.
[0:33:31] <yves_is_online> @derekwst3 fake gamer real boomer
[0:33:32] <+TransporterX7> spam voke pls
[0:33:33] <Fynale> @AngriestPat be prepared for lots of cutscenes for teh 24 man there's a major lore dump
[0:33:34] <%Arnschen> Holy Spirit feels a little flaccid to me compared to Fell Cleves
[0:33:35] <+combomaniadeluxe> as someone who hasn't played a mmo ever, what is he doing?
[0:33:37] <%kamen_advent> apatBig apatWink apatBig
[0:33:37] <+MetalMongger> with no oath???
[0:33:38] <%TheSpiritof2277> I haven't played XIV in forever, shit
[0:33:38] <%valriot> Oh hey, its Second Place Job
[0:33:41] <%yaboybennyd> !raffle
[0:33:42] <%HappiestFace> pat already shitting on chat
[0:33:43] <%Caidezes> Is this World of Warcraft?
[0:33:43] <EASrake> wut
[0:33:45] <%spacekataz18> I think you do the holy spirits first
[0:33:45] <Yaya_> Warrior, Paladin, and Dark Knight are the only three tank classes. Gunblade is coming in Shadowbringers and might be tank, though
[0:33:46] <%badchoice5> This takes me back to my WoW days
[0:33:47] <+OceanGovernor> Its so easy 4Head
[0:33:49] <Aydarkzero> neat
[0:33:50] <+Zaver88> I know how, I just don't like Switching to Sword Oath while Main Tanking
[0:33:51] <+Sambin0> why is there a bevel on everything, it looks awful
[0:33:51] <$Yakobro> @combomaniadeluxe he doing combo
[0:33:52] <%einheri> I feel like my DPS as a lvl 70 dragoon fucking sucks. Optimally doing all my shit on a keyboard is pretty rough
[0:33:55] <KoyaMusa> pagos got buffed but i don't want to go back in, already got two relics
[0:33:56] <+OceanGovernor> just do it 4Head
[0:33:58] <%g0dhand9876> It just works
[0:33:59] <+Zaver88> I never said it was hard.
[0:33:59] <%Captainahab_37> MMOs sound like a bunch of complex bullshit until you actually play them imo
[0:34:02] <ScreamingMeat> Have you ever seen JoCat's Crap Guide To Monster Hunter series?
[0:34:02] <%Ahack13> Thats because fell cleave is fucking fell cleave
[0:34:02] <EmptyEncore> Is DRK fun to play as? I'm incredibly outta game.
[0:34:03] <Ugato> you started talking about the rotation, then like 3 minutes later "and that's the rotation"
[0:34:04] <+blastazoid26> Flacidboi
[0:34:05] <+scratchmesilly> hmmm
[0:34:06] <+Bad1uck> @rosello6 It's not great because if you know how tanking works you can anticipate their needs
[0:34:06] <Peasant_0> Everything feels flacid compared to fell cleave
[0:34:08] <Ugato> fucking kill me
[0:34:09] <r_Foeburden87> gundbade is BAE
[0:34:09] <CatsEyeBlind> I play paladin when I want to tank but I don't want to think while doing so
[0:34:10] <AMaidIndeed> Fell Cleave Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:34:11] <ebonifragaria> God don't make my WoW addiction itch again, I can't go back in. I can't.
[0:34:11] <+Zaver88> I said I don't like to play optimally.
[0:34:12] <SailingSaturn> You Jinxed it cirSlain
[0:34:12] <arcaderabbit48> @Pyr0_Fr0st As a healer main, I promise the game eases you into it really well. Like, doing the early dungeons are actually boring because you have to heal so infrequently. It doesnt get particularly active or scary until much later on. I'd encourage you to give it a try at least through the first two or three dungeons
[0:34:13] <%Genis94> Fell Cleave has those sick chainsaw blade effects. Of COURSE Holy Spirit feels crap by comparison.
[0:34:13] <Gregorhasjoined> No AXE no BRAIN = PLD Main
[0:34:14] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> DRK Buffs please!
[0:34:14] <CarrotWhisky> @payterodactyl FF-games in the main series tends to be JRPG, wheras the spin-offs are of more varied genres, with more strategy-like or action-like. Just remember that each game with few exception holds no canon over another, so choose whichever's settings or characters might interest you. I would recommend FFVI-FFIX for older games (Pre PS2-era.).
[0:34:16] <aeonicvector> SQUALL better conformed
[0:34:17] <@SSaryn> That's because Fellcleave is JUST A FUCKING CHAINSAW
[0:34:19] <+TransporterX7> Gunblade better not be tank dammit
[0:34:19] <+InugamiTheHound> where's bird squad?
[0:34:19] <$KnivesEve> do it again i wasnt watching
[0:34:20] <%PROUD2beGINGER> now learn MCH
[0:34:21] <%blaccbird914> I don't understand the bottom of the screen
[0:34:23] <%SenpaiWeeb_Chan> Yeet
[0:34:25] <ColRedyx> Well hopefully in Shadowbringers the oaths are free oGCDs like they should be.
[0:34:26] <%Captainahab_37> Would yall play a Xenoblade MMO
[0:34:28] <yves_is_online> man this game is a fucking
[0:34:28] <%kamen_advent> Is FFXIV hard to get into?
[0:34:29] <+Mexrage> i hope the gunblade class is both gunblade + magitek gauntlet combo @AngriestPat
[0:34:32] <+Floofiie> Pat when are you gonna start humming Thordan's EX Theme again
[0:34:32] <%ElenaManetta> Muted
[0:34:33] <@SSaryn> HOPE YOU LIKE CHUNKING BOSSES BY YOURSELF WITH FELL CLEAVE
[0:34:33] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Wait a minute. This isn't videogames. This is spreadsheets.
[0:34:34] <%valriot> More Donuhts
[0:34:34] <%Remery_> Pat plays on PC with a PS4 controller? @AngriestPat
[0:34:35] <%snow_bush> Now to figure out if I want to paint minis while Pat plays this, build minis while pat plays this. Or do Jack all.
[0:34:41] <Hitmanassassin2012> I hated being Tank back in the day, I was always forced to flash 99% of the time rather than using any other skill and still got shit on.
[0:34:42] <%ElenaManetta> Not muted
[0:34:44] <CarrotWhisky> @kamen_advent I wouldn't say so. The game is quite heavy with tutorials.
[0:34:48] <aeonicvector> @Captainahab_37 xenosaga? YEEE, wait you said blade....
[0:34:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Am I just old if the fact that the gun blade uses a pistol grip STILL bugs me to this day?
[0:34:50] <+KenderSoup> Its not hard to get into but it takes a lot of time investment
[0:34:51] <RamenRiderZ> Paladins are shield-using COWARDS doodScrub
[0:34:54] <%Thatghostpepper> mch is burst dmg mastery
[0:34:56] <Peasant_0> @kamen_advent not really just that pre 50 is really slow combat wise
[0:34:59] <arcaderabbit48> @kamen_advent No, not at all. It has a free trial up to level 30 or 35, so you can even get in to it free
[0:35:03] <%ElenaManetta> Clip into that bird's ass
[0:35:03] <r_Foeburden87> i play on PC with XB1 Controller
[0:35:06] <Ugato> Pat loves his controllers
[0:35:06] <$Yakobro> @kamen_advent it's long, not hard, you need to do the main story to unlock everything and that takes a while, but you only need 1 character to play every class
[0:35:11] <%Mornaka> hot
[0:35:11] <EmptyEncore> Loved tanking. I used to main a SCH though. SCH is hecking great
[0:35:11] <ColRedyx> @kamen_advent I mean, depends? Wasn't hard for me.
[0:35:11] <+dracgeon> @remery_ yes its compatible with X Input and D Input
[0:35:12] <+SWFanatic> ps4 controller > steam controller?
[0:35:12] <Fear_Ranjer> How do you play this game on console with all of these skills?
[0:35:13] <CatsEyeBlind> I want gunblade to secrectly be Chemist. Just slotting hi-potions into the gun barrel or some shit

[0:35:44] <%Ahack13> i mean the game is perfectly playable with a controller so whatever. I personally cant do controller but I dont think either is really better.
[0:35:44] <%LowBatteryLife> Hardest part of any role is dealing with players who don't know theirs. Don't overwork your healer.
[0:35:46] <+Fenlig> Theres something about the UI of this game that doesnt feel like it fits the fantasy setting
[0:35:49] <Wauughlord> @Fear_Ranjer L2/R2 modify your buttons to be the other skills as far as I recall

[0:37:49] <Wauughlord> @markfletcher PC with controller
[0:37:52] <arcaderabbit48> @Pyr0_Fr0st I felt the same way about starting Tanking. My anxiety is really high when anyone is depending on me for anything, so being the sort of "Leader" of the party sounded horrifying. But once I sat down and tried it out, it actually came fairly easily!
[0:37:53] <%AllYouCanYeet> terra tree
[0:37:54] <CarrotWhisky> @ForgetfulUthanasiast Your companions are starting to fall in a coma. Something caused by a voice warning about a "Flood of Light" with "Open the Gates". In the meantime, the Evil Garlean Empire is brewing with the latest patch revealing that the Emperor is in fact just a Puppet to the Big evil guys the Ascians. Big revelations.

[0:40:29] <arcaderabbit48> @CommanderSqueaks Its a reference to the Sage class of previous games, I believe. Krile does not have kitty ears. Probably.

[0:40:47] <%ElenaManetta> Two minutes.
[0:40:50] <%cureneckbeard> Maybe Krile's parents were just huge FF5 fans and named her after the character
[0:40:51] <%CollinsOfBodom> why does Pat's character look like Benoit

[0:45:02] <haisho> it's Vahn and Penelo that ruined 12 wasn't it
[0:45:04] <+grumbleroar> FFXII is one of my favs. I'll shill for FFXII.
[0:45:04] <%valriot> 12 is shit, but dick likes the bunnies
[0:45:04] <harmlessgs> 9 is meh
[0:45:05] <AlasterAngelo> 12 is fantastic paige and i will box you over it
[0:45:06] <%AncelDeLambert> 12 shows the signs of Squeenix losing its mind

[0:45:07] <AdmiralButtloaf> 9's great

[0:45:09] <ReiDuran> Holy shit @AngriestPat you have HORRIBLE taste for not liking FF9
[0:45:10] <+aivalera> Final Fantasy 9 is the best.
[0:45:10] <AdmiralButtloaf> 1
[0:45:10] <%CollinsOfBodom> 9 is okay
[0:45:14] <%Captainahab_37> Pat all funko pops look like FF9 characters cmon now

[0:45:14] <%SpcOpsBear> Expansion(s)
[0:45:15] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat Warhammer 40k Funko Pops on the horizon
[0:45:15] <+InugamiTheHound> dude IMO ff8 and 12 and type 0 are super underrated
[0:45:15] <DracaenaLeaf> Funko pops are ugly but ffix chibis aren't quite as ugly
[0:45:16] <grayjammer> Thats wrong pat
[0:45:17] <+Jordan_z123> 9 funko pop journey
[0:45:17] <that_owl_guy> Says nothing about FF7's god awful models, lol

[0:45:23] <+Sinister_Aglet> Pat can't stop being wrong, it'd be like a shark not swimming
[0:45:25] <Sanyle> 9 as a game is fine but what really shines is how uniques all the character designs are
[0:45:26] <%pimpinahz> man der be big shouting in da chat
[0:45:26] <+Fenlig> @Yakobro that atleast sounds amazing rather than a disappointing turkey
[0:45:26] <vextalyst> I fucking HATE Zidane
[0:45:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> To everyone using the controller, just use the "cross hot bar" function. It allows you to have up to 64 buttons and that's more than any skill you can fit in
[0:45:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> 1 for pat is wrong
[0:45:30] <mercado94> i like FF9 music
[0:45:30] <%furtivestinbro> Vahn is the biggest jobber I can think of in any FF game.
[0:45:31] <aeonicvector> thats more fair
[0:45:32] <%JGardner88> 13 is alright. eat it
[0:45:33] <CarrotWhisky> Matoya's theme. <3
[0:45:34] <%Luna_Ashford> 12 is pretty decent
[0:45:36] <TheEnablerr> she's right to
[0:45:36] <PumaOfDarkness> "They look like Funko Pops" said the human Funko Pop.
[0:45:40] <%bbHighvalor> ff12 is the best

[0:45:42] <ScreamingMeat> Grandma Swamp
[0:45:42] <matouci> Oh hey Krile escaped Eureka hell to rejoin the MSQ
[0:45:43] <%gusdabus91> 12 is not great
[0:45:43] <%AncelDeLambert> 12 is unfinished, has self-insert characters, is unfinished, has a plot that doesn't quite resolve itself, and is unfinished
[0:45:43] <haisho> oh hey it's Paige
[0:45:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @mylesmoore he will shit on 8 but will defend triple triad to his death
[0:45:44] <CaptainKarite> We ignore 13, it was never made
[0:45:44] <Sanyle> ff12 had amazing gameplay
[0:45:45] <@SSaryn> When was the last time we saw this bitch? About a year?

[0:53:05] <nivlac_555> lol
[0:53:05] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Isn't it that the light is getting too strong?
[0:53:06] <%Shadowthedigger> Pat is mostly correct tho
[0:53:06] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> not SUPER wrong
[0:53:07] <%Ahack13> Pats not wrong about this part
[0:53:07] <AdmiralButtloaf> keep sharing your theory pat
[0:53:07] <KoyaMusa> pat, just wait till speculating
[0:53:07] <+Brewstamasta> Pat is Pat
[0:53:07] <%snow_bush> I guess out of mana means death
[0:53:07] <ebonifragaria> He's so crestfallen
[0:53:08] <$Jungos60> sounds like the lifestream in FF7
[0:53:09] <%yoshkosh20> f'un theory though
[0:53:10] <Cranky_Construct> That was making for a good theory tho
[0:53:10] <@SSaryn> Not entirely wrong but yeah
[0:53:10] <%CJett92> 1 ish 3 ish
[0:53:10] <dekkitout> so anyways- oh im wrong, kay nevermind
[0:53:10] <Fynale> they were storing all the aether
[0:53:13] <CarrotWhisky> No, Pat was quite correct.
[0:53:13] <+Ciphris> no pats right primal summons CONSUME A LOT of aether
[0:53:13] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 They do if you play the Extreme fights. As for main story mode, ehhhh.
[0:53:13] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat you're like 90% right it's fine
[0:53:15] <+UKOrigin> wait what, no pat is getting it right
[0:53:15] <TheOneUpWarrior> Finsh your fuckin thought man!
[0:53:16] <SailingSaturn> Point is Less Aether is bad for everyone cirDad
[0:53:17] <%Divryne> PAT IS RIGHT.
[0:53:18] <%Divryne> 3
[0:53:19] <Hardoraida> don't be sad Pat it's ok
[0:53:20] <%rabiddragon2299> how do I join the sub discord?
[0:53:21] <%Remery_> kepp going i have popcorn
[0:53:22] <mercado94> i havent play the game so i'll belive eveything that Pat says
[0:53:22] <%Shadowthedigger> 3
[0:53:23] <%Ahack13> Pat is wrong about the universe, not the aether thing!
[0:53:23] <+JEiddew> 3
[0:53:24] <%spacekataz18> 3
[0:53:24] <Valask> we learned nothing man Jebaited
[0:53:26] <%mugwugsampoo> PATS RIGHT
[0:53:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Right for the wrong reason
[0:53:26] <%crimsonharvest> always let Pat be fully wrong before you make him sad
[0:53:29] <%CJett92> 3
[0:53:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I came up with the same conclusion
[0:53:30] <Fynale> @AngriestPat the thinning of the aether is a precursor to a calamity
[0:53:31] <thelonechris> Hey Pat!
[0:53:31] <@SSaryn> That's not all of it but yeah
[0:53:32] <ebonifragaria> That's a passing grade!!
[0:53:33] <%Ninestempest> 3
[0:53:34] <%Captainahab_37> @arcaderabbit48 even the extreme fights it wasnt too bad, but i assume i havent unlocked them all
[0:53:34] <%Thatghostpepper> yeah similar to the lifestream
[0:53:35] <%Remery_> Bone dry <3
[0:53:36] <that_owl_guy> THE BURN
[0:53:38] <%Fidel_Castbro> apatWrong
[0:53:38] <derekwst3> bye waifu
[0:53:46] <TheOneUpWarrior> YOU GOTTA BELEIVE!
[0:53:46] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 How far are you?
[0:53:48] <Renuarb> other than a powerful as fuck Ice Dragon
[0:53:50] <%pimpinahz> PAT. Ssaryn says your wrong. He has the gun, so I'll trust him
[0:53:51] <+KenderSoup> Aether = pussy juice
[0:53:53] <%Captainahab_37> i stopped in the late level 50's
[0:53:53] <CarrotWhisky> Think Aether like your "soul energy". Every life form have aether within them, and when the living being dies, their aether dissipates into the lifestream.
[0:53:58] <%AncelDeLambert> so its bionergy
[0:53:59] <+Brewstamasta> Yeah but that was because of the aether dam
[0:53:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> SWOLE
[0:54:00] <+Fenlig> My aethers been thining out its normal but still depressing
[0:54:01] <+SWFanatic> bautista got cast as beast rabban in the new Dune reboot
[0:54:01] <grayjammer> yeyeye sandworms
[0:54:02] <TheOneUpWarrior> Believe*
[0:54:02] <%gespenst25> Bahamut get swole
[0:54:04] <%CollinsOfBodom> aether = gamer goo
[0:54:05] <KoyaMusa> also there's been 7 calamaties already, so 7 of the 14 dimensions have collapsed
[0:54:06] <%snow_bush> SWOLE ENERGY
[0:54:06] <RustyQuarters> Too swole to exist, like Peach
[0:54:11] <%spacekataz18> Yummy foob
[0:54:11] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> food ResidentSleeper
[0:54:11] <%Captainahab_37> i beat the last dungeon in the normal MSQ i thiiiink?
[0:54:12] <%PipIV> Bahamut hearts
[0:54:17] <%Cainhurstcrow> Everyone keeps summoning Big Chungus, even though he takes up 3 times the Aether as Bahamut.
[0:54:22] <Fynale> @AngriestPat naw we found out the burn is where they took the aether to lift up dalamud and we released it back to power teh shields that's currently stopping the empires air force from just going into doma and wrecking shit
[0:54:23] <+HelloImTom08> why do they offer food, everyone picks the money
[0:54:24] <%soycanadiense> @AngriestPat Thank you for being here and helping me get through the week. I just found out my grandma isnt gonna make it and i'm glad you're here to help me through it
[0:54:24] <roboguy2k> Does Pat always play this with a controller?? I thought he played with Mouse and Keyboard
[0:54:26] <ebonifragaria> Disregard quest text, acquire EXP Kappa
[0:54:27] <%Faustgesicht> you talked to old lady. congrats
[0:54:30] <%snow_bush> @PipIV Bahamet Hearts 2
[0:54:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can't believe Pat cowarded out of SF3rd Strike
[0:54:32] <$Yakobro> @Captainahab_37 there's another msq patch in a month or two but ye
[0:54:34] <+Ciphris> also the burn was destroyed from too many summons
[0:54:38] <+MyDarkStorm> who
[0:54:38] <+EvilSoully> Nothing has gone wrong at allll
[0:54:40] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 Okay yeah, there's still a fair bit more to go. Some of the fights get brutal, especially the Extreme fights.
[0:54:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Aether isn't just mana related right? It's life force as well? If there's none then people just wilt to death?
[0:54:44] <RossMirage> Does the sound seem distorted to you chat?
[0:54:46] <%Voidwyvern> Wait a second, Pat is a katana boi. What happened to DRK?
[0:54:51] <matouci> ALexander is the Big Chungus of primals
[0:54:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Controllers > keyboards
[0:54:56] <%Thatghostpepper> dood3S
[0:54:56] <+zedreamcast> What happened to DRK?
[0:54:56] <%lewdskeletor13> FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY
[0:54:58] <%Captainahab_37> i need to renew my sub
[0:55:03] <roboguy2k> Damn I didn't know it was easy to play with a controller
[0:55:04] <%g0dhand9876> These locations are making me feel at home
[0:55:09] <Valask> @AngriestPat I've heard top tier players all prefer controllers, why's that?
[0:55:11] <$Yakobro> @Voidwyvern drk feels like poop to play in HW
[0:55:12] <%valriot> @zedreamcast It sucks
[0:55:14] <Dunnesparce> Is this worth jumping into now after never touching it?
[0:55:16] <%Captainahab_37> Is Dragoon shit?
[0:55:17] <+EvilSoully> So these guys are the evil empire defectors
[0:55:18] <+Fenlig> @AngriestPat Have you tried The Return of the Obra Dinn yet?
[0:55:21] <+ShlickShlocks> Can we get a cat cam?
[0:55:22] <%Voidwyvern> @Reizie_Etherealm basically but it should be noted that Garleans can't use aether at all and thus no magicks
[0:55:26] <+zedreamcast> WAR is super fine
[0:55:26] <%pimpinahz> who's talking
[0:55:26] <roboguy2k> I figured since it's an MMO it would get too overwhelming on a controller
[0:55:27] <ReiDuran> BOO LYSE
[0:55:28] <mercado94> oh its that girl
[0:55:31] <$Yakobro> FUCK YOU LYSE
[0:55:32] <+JEiddew> boo lyse
[0:55:34] <ColRedyx> Same. The controller support is next level. The 14 team figured out the MMO controller scheme.
[0:55:34] <RamenRiderZ> MKB Plebs DansGame
[0:55:34] <%Captainahab_37> because Dragoon have the coolest armor
[0:55:35] <Valask> is alphie boy dead
[0:55:41] <+JoliornJostern> big guys only get one shoulder pad it seems
[0:55:45] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh god I love his voice
[0:55:45] <%cureneckbeard> Ugly people aren't allowed to be heroes in this world
[0:55:50] <%Piemen99> I bet glasses guy is evil
[0:55:52] <%Divryne> REEE BROTHEEERRR.
[0:55:53] <mercado94> censore that forehead
[0:55:54] <%CJett92> eww nipples, how feet instead
[0:55:56] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 I dont think so! I've played Dragoon a fair bit and found it to be really fun and potent
[0:55:58] <%Voidwyvern> @Yakobro you meant stormblood. I know the feel of that dark arts spam lol more so didn't know pat played Sam
[0:55:58] <MidnightSnack69> leave his head nip alooooone
[0:55:59] <%NovaKnightmare> his head makes me uncomfortable
[0:56:01] <Hardoraida> If Alphie dies I'll resub
[0:56:02] <CarrotWhisky> @Reizie_Etherealm I do think Aether is mana-related, although "mana" is rarely used, as the game uses "aether" to describe the same thing. The questline for the job conjurer discusses this where a healer who heals people using her own aether falls in risk of dying if she overdoes it.
[0:56:03] <Gregorhasjoined> BRUTHURRRR
[0:56:03] <sir_nack> this guy looks too nerdy to wear armor
[0:56:03] <%AncelDeLambert> WHERE'S THE BOMB?!
[0:56:04] <+zedreamcast> Alisae is great
[0:56:04] <+EvilSoully> Glasses guy is actually the token good guy of the empire
[0:56:04] <that_owl_guy> No such thing as an ugly hero in any rpg
[0:56:05] <%Remery_> god i can't unsee it
[0:56:06] <studleydoorite> maybe he doesn't know it's there
[0:56:06] <%NovaKnightmare> Kill him Pat
[0:56:09] <%g0dhand9876> That forehead is banned on tumblr
[0:56:11] <$OmegaWeltall> naw, glasses guy is kinda cool actualy
[0:56:12] <AlasterAngelo> i hope there aren't any al-bhed in this game
[0:56:13] <ebonifragaria> I like how he's just wearing regular glasses with that crazy armor
[0:56:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Free the head nipple!
[0:56:16] <%Divryne> B-BRRUTHUUURRR.
[0:56:16] <ScreamingMeat> Forehead presented Nipple
[0:56:18] <Valask> Alphie is fucking DEAD
[0:56:19] <alrobot2014> FF6 Doma?
[0:56:26] <Valask> HE'S FUCKING DEAD
[0:56:32] <$Yakobro> @Voidwyvern yeah I meant SB, don't play any tonks though healers and RDM :p
[0:56:35] <%Ninestempest> yeah it's been 6 months
[0:56:38] <%SpcOpsBear> Is he now?
[0:56:39] <%Captainahab_37> I dont even know if im leveling the right classes for DRG
[0:56:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Voidwyvern Can't use Aether doesn't mean that they don't harbor any innate aether right? Cause that's also a part of their life force or something?
[0:56:41] <%Divryne> ASSIANS.
[0:56:42] <%pimpinahz> @divryne BILTZBALL BBRRRUTHA
[0:56:44] <CarrotWhisky> @alrobot2014 Not the same Doma, but yeah. FFXIV uses alot of names from previous FF:s as homages, but is otherwise contained within FFXIV's own lore and setting.
[0:56:45] <%AncelDeLambert> This "Deleter"
[0:56:46] <ColRedyx> @Valask So they don't destroy their hands. Controllers are more comfortable to hold and because of 14's smart design you have easy access to 48 skills.
[0:56:47] <derekwst3> last time on dragon ball Z.....
[0:56:49] <%Ninestempest> @Captainahab_37 you don't need to level other classes anymore
[0:56:52] <%spacekataz18> This Shadowsnuffer
[0:56:53] <+HelloImTom08> Fookin ASSICIANS
[0:56:55] <that_owl_guy> Then this fucking clown came out of nowhere
[0:56:55] <alrobot2014> ah okay
[0:56:55] <%Piemen99> oh cool this game has elf traps
[0:56:56] <Nat20_Gaming> Hey I get that @AngriestPat is on FF14 but since it was his fault that I got into WarFrame I gotta ask how do I make my mouse sensitivity higher so it doesn't flick around like I'm playing some FPS?
[0:56:59] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 You need to start as a Lancer, and it'll become Dragoon at level 30
[0:57:01] <%Captainahab_37> oh shit
[0:57:04] <%Voidwyvern> @Reizie_Etherealm I'm actually not sure that garleans don't have innate aether
[0:57:06] <%Divryne> ASSIAN DELETER.
[0:57:12] <%megabrogus> so how long is the story in this patch meant to be
[0:57:12] <+SWFanatic> fat asses?
[0:57:14] <%g0dhand9876> Al bhed. More like Am Dhed
[0:57:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Adam authorizes backstory
[0:57:17] <Valask> @ColRedyx interesting, usually that's not the case
[0:57:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Ass LUL
[0:57:20] <Gregorhasjoined> The Sh@d0w_hUNTER69Xxx
[0:57:21] <AdmiralButtloaf> Shadowbork buster

[0:57:25] <MultipleJiggs> It's so weird to hear the english voices for this.
[0:57:25] <%TheSpiritof2277> Fat ascians
[0:57:30] <%Voidwyvern> @Reizie_Etherealm equating it to lifeforce though is accurate enough
[0:57:32] <RamenRiderZ> Shadowblasters
[0:57:36] <+JEiddew> why didn't they use linkpearls
[0:57:43] <+OceanGovernor> gachiBASS ass hunters/
[0:57:44] <Polengoldur> so i just finished listening to the podcast and wow was that a trash fire
[0:57:51] <+HelloImTom08> is pat gonna do the 24man its really fuckin good
[0:57:52] <$Yakobro> @JEiddew something something magic
[0:57:54] <CarrotWhisky> @Voidwyvern Correct. Garleans, full blooded that is, cannot manipulate Aether, which is why they cannot handle magicks. It is therefore the reason that they are so dependent on Magitek-technology, giving them a techonological advantage in comparison to the Eorzea-Alliances who have magic users.
[0:57:56] <%g0dhand9876> Is that ignis
[0:58:05] <+EvilSoully> He already did the 24 man yesterday
[0:58:09] <%cureneckbeard> apatPorgmo
[0:58:10] <$Yakobro> @HelloImTom08 he did it offstream, and got an alliance C that didn't know left from right LUL
[0:58:12] <+EvilSoully> Off stream
[0:58:17] <%Captainahab_37> When is Pat gonna be on CumTown
[0:58:21] <a_mad_dragon> it can't be ignis, he isn't trying to sell us cup noodle
[0:58:22] <ColRedyx> @Valask As a former heroic raid (before Mythics), I can tell you first hand I was starting to get RSI after a couple years, but no such pain in 14, and the controller doesn't hold you back at all, unless maybe if you're a healer. For tank and DPS, it's 100% viable.
[0:58:23] <%AncelDeLambert> What have the Romans ever done for us?!
[0:58:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat your character is SO SHORT
[0:58:41] <TheBigO75> AGAIN??
[0:58:42] <%Voidwyvern> I hope Pat does the new trial after if he hasn't
[0:58:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Voidwyvern Then aether is a must have in one's body even if you can't utilize it for spells and such then
[0:58:47] <+HelloImTom08> @Yakobro same shit happend to me, C is alwasy shit LUL
[0:58:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Somebody call the UN
[0:58:49] <%crimsonharvest> its nukes

[0:59:18] <%Voidwyvern> @Reizie_Etherealm yeah, though using aether in a controlled manner is fine. Red mages use their own aether for their magicks
[0:59:21] <%LowBatteryLife> This game has more war crimes than Gundam UC
[0:59:21] <$Yakobro> WOOLIE
[0:59:24] <CarrotWhisky> @sodium_station The Garlean Empire does not handle conventions with Eorzean savages!

[0:59:40] <%Genis94> Pat, that's over in Doma
[0:59:40] <DiaDiaDiamond> That doma
[0:59:40] <CarrotWhisky> The shield only covers the Burn in Doma, waaay over in Othard, Pat.

[1:00:59] <Estuko> damn future nerds
[1:00:59] <%AncelDeLambert> the FUUUUUTUUUUUUREEEEE
[1:01:00] <alrobot2014> wait there's a race war and everyone's getting the succ by a future man?
[1:01:01] <sodium_station> literally "Who's talking" haha
[1:01:01] <%crimsonharvest> I bet it's Garland from FF1's time loop again
[1:01:02] <+JEiddew> it's not from the goddamn future pat, it's the WoD
[1:01:02] <+HelloImTom08> is that what pat is like when he doestn drink redbull
[1:01:02] <derekwst3> I blame barry
[1:01:02] <%TheSpiritof2277> HE MUST WIN
[1:01:03] <Foggysheep> theyre tripping on acid
[1:01:03] <%pectusumbra> awww, I wanted everything to be wildly changed when that was over
[1:01:03] <KoyaMusa> i mean that is the voice of arbert, the warrior of darkness
[1:01:06] <+Fenlig> I'm calling it now, its future pat fucking with himself
[1:01:08] <%snow_bush> @valriot The true hero of Street Fighter
[1:01:09] <%Ragnarok_Flames> guys, this isnt Phantasy Star Universe. the superior MMO
[1:01:10] <@JustinianKnight> Warrior of Darkness
[1:01:10] <%Agami23> "he must win!"
[1:01:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> BECAUSE WAR
[1:01:12] <ColRedyx> @dodge_and_dust Best in any MMO too, by an insane margin.
[1:01:13] <+InugamiTheHound> its is Ellone from ff8?
[1:01:14] <ArcticAsylum> SHAO KAHN MUST WIN
[1:01:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Oh, thank the gods, especially Bachhus
[1:01:15] <ScreamingMeat> YouWHY
[1:01:15] <Daxalog> If theyre so SMART then why are they in future? Exactly.
[1:01:16] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Well have fun, don't want any spoilers for my playthrough.
[1:01:16] <$KnivesEve> NECRID MUST WIN
[1:01:17] <%g0dhand9876> Raiden chatting from mk11
[1:01:18] <%Captainahab_37> Patron, we have to go to Kamurocho
[1:01:20] <%pimpinahz> WHO SAID THAT!! WHO'S TALKIng
[1:01:22] <%aishman> Wait so, why does she not get effected? Doesn't she also have the echo??
[1:01:22] <mr_slaide> We've tried nothing and we're out of ideas!
[1:01:23] <that_owl_guy> Bet; Future player character is trying to stop current version from fucking up
[1:01:25] <%Disname23> Maybe a fucking giant war will help figure things out
[1:01:27] <%Voidwyvern> @dodge_and_dust I love the story but it certainly has slower points. If interested in the game there is a free trial to play up to level 35
[1:01:31] <+blastazoid26> and the voice whispers... HE MUST WIN
[1:01:38] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It'd be cool if that voice is just your character from a different timeline
[1:01:38] <%cureneckbeard> I warned you bro! I warned you about aether!
[1:01:41] <ScreamingMeat> POOGIE
[1:01:42] <+EvilSoully> Only the current Scions are getting effected
[1:01:42] <%Captainahab_37> the war theyre talking about is a Yakuza War
[1:01:43] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat Pat, the shield in the Burn protects Doma, not Ala Mhigo.
[1:01:45] <%london_flexing> TIME TRAVELER: Pat, you have to let them use the chemical weapons to save the future!
[1:01:47] <CarrotWhisky> Fun fact: the "Throw wide the gates"-monologues that the Voice says has a similiar speech told by Loffrey in FF: Tacticts.
[1:01:49] <%snow_bush> In this episode of FF14, Raiden tries to undo what he's done.
[1:01:51] <+EvilSoully> Lyse is spared by it since she quit to run the army
[1:02:01] <%g0dhand9876> KEFKA MUST WIN
[1:02:04] <grayjammer> I told you bro
[1:02:08] <Valask> @AngriestPat Would you rather your character talk or be silent in these story bits?
[1:02:09] <%edgeyberzerker> mmmm that tasty music
[1:02:09] <haisho> oh god I love this song
[1:02:11] <$MattPlainview> cheer200 Hey, Pat. Do you think Sekiro will have a surprise kick like the Old Ones in Bloodborne? Or will it be a more tonally straight forward experience like Dark Souls?
[1:02:12] <alrobot2014> wow it even uses the ff6 doma music
[1:02:15] <AlasterAngelo> Even across games Raiden can't stop fucking up
[1:02:15] <ReiDuran> god I love Cyan's theme so fucking much
[1:02:16] <SaltyAzteca> Cyan theme im sorry what?
[1:02:17] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Divryne)
[1:02:22] <+blastazoid26> Damn you geography
[1:02:25] <%AncelDeLambert> hoho, doma doma doma!
[1:02:26] <alrobot2014> they went all in on these references
[1:02:26] <$Yakobro> wow pat
[1:02:27] <Polengoldur> having never bothered with ff14, wow does this look like generic mmo #9
[1:02:28] <CarrotWhisky> @alrobot2014 A mixture of Cyan's theme.
[1:02:29] <mr_slaide> Elmo is such a good boy.
[1:02:29] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> welcome to literal Doma guys

[1:02:37] <%lewdskeletor13> BRUTE SMARTS
[1:02:39] <%aishman> No seriously though Pat, why does Lyse not get effected by future voices shit? Does she not have the echo anymore something??
[1:02:40] <%g0dhand9876> Here we go
[1:02:41] <ColRedyx> @SaltyAzteca Doma theme, since this is Doma and all.

[1:03:06] <arcaderabbit48> @aishman Lyse never had the Echo at all. She's not a member of the Scions anymore technically, so that may be why?
[1:03:07] <TheA1ternative> We can become HUGE?
[1:03:08] <%pectusumbra> damn it, I never played an MMO, but if I did it'd probably be this one. Kingdom of Doma baby

[1:03:36] <%aishman> @arcaderabbit48 I could have sworn she did, I know she took her sister's place and her sister def had the echo but I thought Lyse did as well.
[1:03:36] <%sparrrow_> is that a wolf man

[1:04:00] <%emillionghost> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[1:04:02] <CarrotWhisky> @aishman Lyse doesn't have the Echo to begin with. She also wasn't a Scion either, as her identity was faked by Papalymo. Onlyt Minfilia, Unkulhai, some echo-fighters that got killed in the assault at the Waking Sands and that Ala Mhigan fighter who was the product of rape have the echo (Aldervard?)
[1:04:02] <aeonicvector> I'm captain basch
[1:04:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Is this Smash?

[1:04:21] <aeonicvector> i'm THE captain Basch VOn Ronsenburg
[1:04:21] <CarrotWhisky> @aishman And Krile herself of course.
[1:04:22] <SailingSaturn> Budget cirSlain
[1:04:22] <%TheDude8D> not knowing what the hell is going on is a ride
[1:04:23] <+JEiddew> small indie company
[1:04:24] <Polengoldur> voice acting is expensive
[1:04:24] <Dani_el_Dani> @lewdskeletor13 kinda
[1:04:25] <NoctisxMog> Don't listen to Ondore's lies!
[1:04:26] <%g0dhand9876> Budget low
[1:04:26] <ScreamingMeat> The Budget died
[1:04:27] <arcaderabbit48> @aishman Very few of the Scions actually have the Echo. There's a boss fight against a Primal where you're tasked with protecting Lyse and Alisae because they don't have the Echo, but insist on fighting anyway.
[1:04:27] <alrobot2014> IM CAPTAIN BASCH
[1:04:30] <+zedreamcast> Pat have you done Seiryu yet?
[1:04:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> Budget_down
[1:04:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They're busy with Shadowbringers, they can't spare any effort here lol
[1:04:36] <derekwst3> it was Bowsette
[1:04:36] <%valriot> Cos Square Enix didnt give Stormblood a budget
[1:04:39] <%Cainhurstcrow> Budget go down
[1:04:40] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@anAngryHamster) (warning)
[1:04:43] <%sparrrow_> @AngriestPat can you make the subtitles bigger?
[1:04:44] <%FrustratedAF> fine i'll come see what's so cool about the mmo nonsense
[1:04:45] <%cureneckbeard> The aether is too weak so nobody has voices
[1:04:46] <EatMyBeeper> I wanna see a Pat dab!
[1:04:49] <%Captainahab_37> as soon as pat leabes the cutscene it looks like Runescape
[1:04:50] <ScreamingMeat> Quality go up, but Budge go down
[1:04:51] <Valask> is this the land of the weebs
[1:04:53] <%g0dhand9876> apatDab
[1:04:53] <ArcticAsylum> My dog just stepped on my phone and closed the stream and all my apps lol
[1:04:56] <%aishman> RIGHT! I forgot, thanks gang
[1:04:56] <CarrotWhisky> Funnily enough, there's a character that's very reminiscent of Captain Basch, but with the appearence of a villian from FFXII.
[1:04:57] <Polengoldur> the voice acting budget got funneled into the FF7 remake. never to b e heard from again
[1:05:02] <%FrustratedAF> chat is paige with us tonight?
[1:05:04] <%aishman> I legit forgot about Lyse not having the echo from the get go
[1:05:05] <RustyQuarters> Big chungus subtitles
[1:05:12] <SailingSaturn> you can but you won't LUL
[1:05:13] <CarrotWhisky> They spent the VA-budget on the new raid.
[1:05:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Mustard Mom is always here
[1:05:16] <+JEiddew> well he can but he'd have to resize the rest of his hud
[1:05:16] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a common problem, text size
[1:05:17] <alrobot2014> holy crap alisaie is tiny
[1:05:21] <bearalin> Gosh really feels like bad stuff is on the horizon
[1:05:23] <axelcezar> oh boy, i was laughing my ass out on what the "open restrooms" policy on starbucks resulted. Drug needles everywhere

[1:05:33] <arcaderabbit48> @aishman Its really unclear who does and does not! Wish they'd been more open about that form the first place
[1:05:33] <+miguelrod777> crazy talk
[1:05:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Can't wait for Pat to reach the plot dump
[1:05:40] <%Voidwyvern> Don't worry bout it
[1:05:48] <%TheDude8D> that's right Jay
[1:05:48] <ArcticAsylum> WHO'S TALKING
[1:05:50] <ColRedyx> @SaltyAzteca 14 is its own canon separate from the other games like everything else, but practically everything that existed in all the other FFs has a 14 version. Mysidia, Rabanastre, Ivalice, Bal, etc. all have 14 canon versions. It's a bigger crossover than Dissidia.
[1:05:53] <RamenRiderZ> Open wide the gates, stop having them closed
[1:05:55] <%pimpinahz> its fine

[1:15:38] <%crimsonharvest> my GUNBLADE DICK can only get so hard
[1:15:39] <+Landsharks> Thordan ate Lahabrea
[1:15:43] <anAngryHamster> This cutscene sounds like that shitpost about Melee jargon
[1:15:43] <derekwst3> Where is Fugins?
[1:15:48] <%lewdskeletor13> PUNISHED GAIUS
[1:15:48] <TyrantBelial> Put your armor back on you're too lame without it.
[1:15:48] <%AncelDeLambert> actually, yeah, they should all be snowblind
[1:15:49] <%snow_bush> And then he wen't blind from the sun\
[1:15:51] <sodium_station> man this guy radiates BIG DICK energy
[1:15:54] <%catmoons> too many bottoms
[1:15:58] <%CubicPhantom> INT +5!
[1:16:00] <+Marienkin> A controller?

[1:16:03] <+dodge_and_dust> wow. people really dislike these Ascians
[1:16:05] <%catmoons> need more tops
[1:16:05] <%AncelDeLambert> "I fucking love masks!!!"
[1:16:06] <+JEiddew> Thordran killed Lahabreah and Igorhyiem, we killed Nabriales with Moenbryda's help and holy shti these names are gibberish
[1:16:08] <%catmoons> 3/5

[1:16:14] <Hellarussian> Mitsurugi looks fresh
[1:16:14] <%g0dhand9876> This guys too cool to stay alive clearly
[1:16:19] <%Remery_> Furry mask
[1:16:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Your mask will make a fine addition to my collection
[1:16:22] <$MattPlainview> Yo, is this guy Roose Bolton? Sounds like him.
[1:16:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Pat's character still in battle stance? Chill dude.
[1:16:35] <%Jpdodds> power creep,you say
[1:16:38] <%CubicPhantom> dude needs to sit down
[1:16:38] <AoG_JarlRaven> that has to be Roose Bolton
[1:16:38] <CarrotWhisky> @JEiddew I think all the Ascian names are homage to the characters with similiar names from Ivalice-series?
[1:16:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> these fuckin edgelords
[1:16:43] <ScreamingMeat> That Mitsurugi looking motherfucker is nearly British enough for the voice he has
[1:16:46] <%Remery_> cool poses
[1:16:46] <%CubicPhantom> but thinks it would ruin the mood
[1:16:46] <%snow_bush> @CommanderSqueaks One can't just stop power stancing
[1:16:46] <%Ahack13> Yo did you know Giaus is a huge badass whose done way more work than you in dealing with ascians?
[1:16:48] <%AncelDeLambert> those are some silly names
[1:16:50] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> no one does
[1:16:50] <CarrotWhisky> Emet-Selch is completely new.
[1:16:51] <+jorgamund> look at these robed jokers
[1:16:54] <%skizzuto> organization xiii
[1:16:57] <%furtivestinbro> look at these edgy fucks
[1:16:59] <%sparrrow_> ELUSIVE
[1:17:01] <%spacekataz18> Third one is new and no one know bout him
[1:17:02] <+Kravedarknesss> It's not a final fantasy game without GIANT CRYSTALS
[1:17:04] <derekwst3> Shadow duelists?
[1:17:07] <anAngryHamster> BTW did they ever fix monks?
[1:17:12] <Gregorhasjoined> furtive emet-selch, so easily forgotten....
[1:17:13] <Angry_Ev1L> literally kingdom hearts garbage lul
[1:17:14] <%rdark_ksu> why are your ears stupid?
[1:17:14] <AoG_JarlRaven> FURTIVE PYGMY
[1:17:15] <+JEiddew> @CarrotWhisky Yeah, and they're all attributed to the zodiac signs. Emet-selch is, interestingly, Gemini.
[1:17:15] <%g0dhand9876> When's roxas
[1:17:16] <+BarkerStreams> WoL = 3rd ASCIAN
[1:17:18] <%sparrrow_> Ass-cian huh ...

[1:17:21] <@JustinianKnight> mnk still not great
[1:17:24] <%FrustratedAF> whoacrash.mp3
[1:17:24] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> KEYBLADEW
[1:17:29] <%Fidel_Castbro> Excuse you
[1:17:31] <%kamen_advent> Gaius has the same VA as Gabranth in Japan.
[1:17:34] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not fantasy without crystals
[1:17:36] <%Fidel_Castbro> as a Monk Main I can tiell you Monks are completely All right
[1:17:41] <%Thatghostpepper> they've buffed monks in this patch
[1:17:41] <PowerWeightedCell> they recasted all the VAs years ago with an english theatre studio, lots of popular soap actors from the UK are voicing the cast its kinda surreal
[1:17:41] <%Ml33tninja> Classic JRPG mysterious third unknown opponent
[1:17:42] <%FrostMass22> Does this make sense to people who have actually played this?
[1:17:42] <%lewdskeletor13> GAWRSH SORA
[1:17:43] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @anAngryHamster kinda. it got a small buff this patch and is planned for overhaul in 5.0
[1:17:44] <%Fidel_Castbro> they'll get buffed again for 5.0
[1:17:46] <%Voidwyvern> @anAngryHamster MNK got a slight buffs. FoF 6% instead of 5 and non positial potency buffs
[1:17:47] <mr_slaide> Boi!
[1:17:52] <%FrustratedAF> reminder that crystal chronicles is STILL coming to the switch
[1:17:54] <arcaderabbit48> @FrostMass22 Yes
[1:17:59] <CarrotWhisky> @FrostMass22 It does actually, surprisingly so.
[1:17:59] <@JustinianKnight> potency buff is not a real fix
[1:18:01] <TyrantBelial> maybe this shit is in balance for a reason.
[1:18:04] <%crimsonharvest> did they use a nega ether bomb
[1:18:07] <Bailey__gaming> Boi!
[1:18:08] <%Voidwyvern> not a fix no just changes
[1:18:10] <laguerrilha> That dude had a huge zip
[1:18:10] <%FrustratedAF> damn you black rose apatPat
[1:18:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, not CHEMICALS?!!
[1:18:13] <+chronopaladin> what the heck, blue mage came with this patch? I haven't been paying attention; brb, gotta resub
[1:18:15] <%claudesavegely> fat gas
[1:18:15] <%pimpinahz> another forehead nipple
[1:18:17] <%bigmuffpie> hack reference?
[1:18:18] <ColRedyx> @FrostMass22 Yup. This is many, many, MANY hours in.
[1:18:19] <%g0dhand9876> The strongest crystal is meth
[1:18:19] <Saterion> Mustard Gas
[1:18:21] <%maskedriderhero> Is that a HxH reference
[1:18:24] <arcaderabbit48> @FrostMass22 This isn't a Kingdom Hearts situation, its actually fairly straightforward if you play through the game
[1:18:27] <ScreamingMeat> My Chemical Romance will never win!
[1:18:27] <+DoktahDoktah> Worked in WW2 and Vietnam.
[1:18:28] <+jorgamund> I dunno if this guy realized, but extermination is a quite common part of conquest
[1:18:28] <+JEiddew> @chronopaladin One more week because gotta polish that shitty minigame
[1:18:29] <sodium_station> Magical Mustard Gas, Paige's favorite
[1:18:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Chemical weaponry? In my fantasy game?
[1:18:33] <+Fenlig> God, do you do anything in this game?
[1:18:34] <%FrustratedAF> is that what we call it now? "toxic" gas?
[1:18:34] <%Thatghostpepper> next week for Blue mage
[1:18:34] <%Jpdodds> Chemical Warfare?! Colonel, you can't be serious!
[1:18:35] <RittiFruity> Pat is not Roe?
[1:18:35] <NoxiousDvs> Dallas Cowboys Emmitt Smith is an Ascian PogChamp
[1:18:40] <%snow_bush> Paige, what did you do?
[1:18:41] <gustavozxd> final fantasy meth Chronicles
[1:18:42] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @chronopaladin BLU becomes viable next week fyi
[1:18:42] <%FrustratedAF> farts cancelled?
[1:18:43] <a_mad_dragon> there's no escape from fart gas
[1:18:43] <+chronopaladin> @JEiddew oh okay, thanks
[1:18:45] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Time to tell the Eorzean Alliance to issue gas masks lol
[1:18:45] <%CubicPhantom> could you not just invent gas masks?
[1:18:46] <ColRedyx> Yeah, this story isn't NEARLY as convoluted as something like KH.
[1:18:49] <arcaderabbit48> @Fenlig This patch is really heavy on cutscenes
[1:18:49] <KoyaMusa> no pat, wait
[1:18:50] <%ElenaManetta> Shut up don't talk about it
[1:18:50] <Bailey__gaming> Pop that zit man! Jesus
[1:18:52] <CarrotWhisky> @chronopaladin BLU comes in a week, and it plays differently from the main jobs, as it is a limited job due to very different gameplay nature. You cannot use BLU in instanced dungeons, trials, raids, e.t.c.
[1:18:52] <%claudesavegely> they totally have another factory
[1:18:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gaius already beat the game for you.
[1:18:53] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @chronopaladin *available
[1:18:55] <+OceanGovernor> Oh thanks
[1:18:55] <%ElenaManetta> The less you talk about it the more it will be forgotten
[1:18:55] <%Disname23> it's all cool now
[1:18:56] <%FrostMass22> It's good that the story actually makes sense
[1:18:57] <Gregorhasjoined> Black Rose machine br0ke
[1:18:57] <%gnarly_memes_bro> WHO NEEDS IT
[1:18:57] <%furtivestinbro> no but shut ut
[1:18:58] <%valriot> BUDGET
[1:19:00] <sodium_station> magical mustard gas aint gotta explain shit
[1:19:00] <%Ml33tninja> Yeah gas robs you the chance to kill with their bare hands
[1:19:00] <deviljhojho94> oh
[1:19:03] <%crimsonharvest> ok but what about the weapons no doubt already deployed???
[1:19:03] <+Cigwynn> Clearly it isn't important, I guess LUL
[1:19:05] <ScreamingMeat> A weapon to surpass Bahamut
[1:19:06] <fiercefiresoul> Yeah, this part bugged the hell out of me too. Whole lot of tell-don't-show going on here.
[1:19:07] <%AncelDeLambert> This weapon uses chemicals, it is the most evil weapon possible!
[1:19:07] <%cureneckbeard> gas nerfed
[1:19:08] <%pimpinahz> DROP IT LIKE ITS HAWT!!! lol
[1:19:08] <deviljhojho94> wtf
[1:19:10] <RamenRiderZ> Sssshhh its fine
[1:19:21] <%lewdskeletor13> This seems like trash
[1:19:26] <TheA1ternative> HA HA HA HA
[1:19:27] <%sparrrow_> tis indeed
[1:19:27] <+psychocalibur> @AngriestPat had to be written out like fugo
[1:19:27] <%CubicPhantom> yeah some real Adam Sandler level shit
[1:19:30] <%AncelDeLambert> like... comedy in the Greek sense?
[1:19:32] <+JEiddew> Did you hear that? "Put your heart at rest?" Remember that because I'll be yelling about it in a minute.
[1:19:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Tis weak to GAS!
[1:19:34] <sodium_station> it's lore dump for people who are deep into ff14 already
[1:19:36] <%pimpinahz> lol he looks like the character in Onimusha
[1:19:38] <%Fidel_Castbro> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:19:38] <+Marienkin> WE CLONES NOW
[1:19:38] <ColRedyx> @FrostMass22 Not only does it make sense, it's really good. Better than most of the singleplayer FFs.
[1:19:40] <%g0dhand9876> Nah man, Paul blart is a bad comedy
[1:19:42] <%crimsonharvest> oh is this actually gonna to turn out to be the 'poisoning of doma' scenario as a twist?
[1:19:43] <SailingSaturn> more Clones cirSlain
[1:19:43] <%TheDude8D> a comedy like tragedy/comedy?
[1:19:43] <%lewdskeletor13> WHAT
[1:19:44] <+chronopaladin> I'm okay with weird shit for BLU as long as it doesn't involve eureka

[1:26:11] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> When will you play Dark Souls: Daughters of Ash?
[1:26:12] <SaltyAzteca> GO KILL SOME SHIT
[1:26:12] <+jorgamund> ...did that line really deserve the dramatic camera swoop?
[1:26:12] <CarrotWhisky> @Ahack13 Only the very top of the Garlean hierchy knows about Solus and his Ascian-nature. Keep in mind however that he didn't actually showed up to Varis until 4.4, and he only showed up to fix Lahabrea's failures.
[1:26:17] <%badchoice5> This guy looks like if Kefka were in FF12
[1:26:18] <+zaras00> oops turned the light into literal poison
[1:26:18] <+Mexrage> that happy stroll
[1:26:18] <+EvilSoully> That walk cycle tho
[1:26:20] <%TheSpiritof2277> nice strut
[1:26:21] <%Fruitywhompus> uh oh
[1:26:25] <CarrotWhisky> Solus theme is very dope.
[1:26:27] <gustavozxd> @lordspooklekins well good for you because his dlc is the only one that didn't get cancelled LUL
[1:26:28] <+robert_edwards> are these the baddies?
[1:26:28] <%CJett92> Obvious evil guy is obviously evil
[1:26:30] <%AncelDeLambert> hahaha watch him walk away like it's a skater vid!!
[1:26:31] <%Remery_> Get Ass?
[1:26:32] <sodium_station> Mega Ultra Evil
[1:26:32] <Asper_Usual> this is quickly becoming a comedy act
[1:26:33] <%Fidel_Castbro> be an Ass
[1:26:35] <thelonechris> Assians
[1:26:35] <SaltyAzteca> Be an ass, ahaaaa
[1:26:35] <%CubicPhantom> "frolic through the fields"
[1:26:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SILVA
[1:26:36] <Fordrilin> Wait, WAIT, he wants the Light to use Black Rose?
[1:26:36] <alrobot2014> @fluffy_sauce because he cast the genophage on the entire krogan species?
[1:26:36] <%rdark_ksu> god they all look like such nerds
[1:26:37] <DrMoose7> jerk it?
[1:26:41] <%g0dhand9876> This is like a deadly premonition cutscene
[1:26:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> uh-oh
[1:26:48] <%pimpinahz> assiens?? yeah, you are an ass
[1:26:49] <Mastigias> I love Solus. He such a douchebag.
[1:26:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pat don't do that
[1:26:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Not for long
[1:26:53] <CarrotWhisky> Varis is very Vayne Solidur like.
[1:26:53] <+sergeantsuperbeast> Varis is rad and he only gets radder in this patch
[1:26:56] <themisticmist2000> EDGE ARMOUR
[1:26:56] <%nitronLVIII> He's gonna die aint he
[1:26:58] <%AncelDeLambert> that is the DUMBEST helmet I've ever seen
[1:27:00] <Psyramics> how does that hat stay on his head?
[1:27:00] <%Agami23> that dude is pretty golbez-ey
[1:27:02] <+sergeantsuperbeast> Awesome villain
[1:27:02] <%Ahack13> Varis hates all of thos stupid magic shit.
[1:27:03] <Worldbrand> I usually forget the events that follow my mortal demise
[1:27:04] <%ElenaManetta> I didnt forget shit, I was just testing you.
[1:27:06] <+Zaver88> Varis you fucking moron
[1:27:08] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @gustavozxd oh i'm well aware.I would have been upset honestly if that wasn't the one they decided to keep
[1:27:09] <%ahalfeatenchocolateorange> this guy looks like someone's wow oc.
[1:27:09] <%Disname23> the music doesn't really fit this scene
[1:27:10] <%Afterman_> this vampire ass soundin mofo
[1:27:13] <%furtivestinbro> if he'd just get a better helm that armor would be dope.
[1:27:15] <%Prism_Wing> That voice
[1:27:16] <arcaderabbit48> @Fordrilin He seems to think the Black Rose will be effected by the high amount of Light ether currently in the FF14 world, but what exactly he means by that is not yet clear.
[1:27:16] <Bailey__gaming> How is this armour in anyway practical?
[1:27:18] <%claudesavegely> FUCK YOU DAD
[1:27:19] <guppy_> this guy sounds a lot like vamp
[1:27:19] <+shirimegane> Oh man his VA is going *in*
[1:27:20] <%lewdskeletor13> apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada
[1:27:22] <%gespenst25> He planned it all with some sort of plan.
[1:27:24] <+mecha_11> Truly this man is the stupidest looking antagonist I have ever seen.
[1:27:27] <ReiDuran> These guys are just CHEWING the scenery
[1:27:27] <%Fruitywhompus> varis seems,,, dramatic
[1:27:30] <+SWFanatic> and that was the best take they got
[1:27:31] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god look at this chucklefuck
[1:27:33] <%ElenaManetta> *skips stone*
[1:27:33] <themisticmist2000> His voice actor is good tho
[1:27:33] <+UKOrigin> lol His glove is on backwards
[1:27:35] <%Fidel_Castbro> Really Varis it never occurred to you that it was on purpose its such a Solus thing to do
[1:27:36] <CarrotWhisky> Varis is probably the only major Garlean character still alive that truly believes in the Garlean idealism.
[1:27:39] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat SUP MAN
[1:27:39] <+ClumsyYoukai> @Bailey__gaming I get the impression it's not _supposed_ to be practical, but ornamental since he's... emperor
[1:27:40] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Guys, he's literally the king of the garlean country, his armor is supposed to be ornate
[1:27:40] <+sergeantsuperbeast> You PLANNED for me to grow up in a race war?!
[1:27:42] <HeadsHeldHigh> LOL
[1:27:43] <%Remery_> He's evil and he loves it ;/

[1:28:01] <finetunedregalia> all according to keikaku

[1:28:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Are WE the baddies?"
[1:28:06] <%Remery_> Two Generations
[1:28:07] <alrobot2014> So Grandpa Solus started the race war?
[1:28:09] <%Afterman_> I...HAVE A PLAN
[1:28:12] <sodium_station> McShoulders Hat Man looks more evil
[1:28:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Arrest him.
[1:28:14] <$Niney_Who> Fuck this yin-yang looking wanker
[1:28:15] <bearalin> Have faith!
[1:28:15] <RossMirage> Solus is joyfully evil.
[1:28:16] <%TheSpiritof2277> Gramps is a grade A shitlord
[1:28:17] <+ZeekZaku> VOLGIN
[1:28:18] <%badchoice5> Are they actually called Ass-ians?
[1:28:18] <Ziginski> those are some loyal guards
[1:28:19] <AlexanderTheConquerer> he takes such joy in being cartoonishly evil
[1:28:20] <arcaderabbit48> @alrobot2014 Literally yes
[1:28:23] <LixFury> @Afterman_ fuck off dutch
[1:28:24] <%Caidezes> Okay, but seriously, what the hell is he wearing?
[1:28:27] <themisticmist2000> yup
[1:28:27] <%g0dhand9876> He has no faith
[1:28:30] <%Prism_Wing> Is this ALL cutscenes?
[1:28:32] <%Fruitywhompus> those shoulder pads are impractical
[1:28:38] <%salty_syd913> "wait are we the bad guys?" man in evil armor asks
[1:28:39] <AdmiralButtloaf> he just loves being evil
[1:28:42] <%lewdskeletor13> ResidentSleeper
[1:28:43] <DetroitSentai> MSQ is Main Story Quests, so yeah
[1:28:43] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @Prism_Wing cutscenes and 1 dungeon
[1:28:45] <%Ml33tninja> Okay why not just pop him in half?!?!
[1:28:46] <%ElenaManetta> CRUELLA DEVIL! That's who I keep thinking of
[1:28:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So is this an excuse to have this guy never stop being the main villain?
[1:28:53] <Plague_bagel> theyre both evil, just one thinks he isnt and the other knows he is
[1:28:54] <sodium_station> One is just evil the other enjoys being evil. Alright
[1:28:55] <vingadivo> HE DABBED?
[1:28:55] <bearalin> Look at this hero
[1:28:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's funny to see people say that these obvious bad guys are bad, while the real bad guy is the warrior of light
[1:28:57] <%cureneckbeard> Look at this guy. He's absolutely a Final Fantasy villain
[1:29:00] <%Remery_> Evil Pose
[1:29:00] <%kiiiirsten> tapping my foot waiting for New Vegas to start while I watch Austin Powers but also I love Pat so I gotta stay tabbed in and SUPPORT!

[1:29:26] <Caivyre> I love how much of a shit he is, it's the best
[1:29:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Wtf is this shit
[1:29:27] <krymzen5> he seems like a fun villain
[1:29:29] <arcaderabbit48> God, Solus is great
[1:29:29] <CarrotWhisky> I love Solus haminess. His theatre-background in the lore clearly shows here.
[1:29:29] <%Nobrev> kefka is that you
[1:29:29] <+SodiusChubz> oooooo
[1:29:30] <%rdark_ksu> Calling your family your sire is fucked
[1:29:30] <MidnightSnack69> solus is so awful i love him
[1:29:31] <%Arnschen> Hey, the other trailer line
[1:29:32] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That expression
[1:29:33] <Polengoldur> how is that guard not freaking out
[1:29:41] <Worldbrand> I want this plotline to be put into wrestling in 30 years
[1:29:41] <%Caidezes> ...Just kill him. He's standing right there.
[1:29:41] <+DoktahDoktah> I wish the way the dialog shows on the screen would match how its being said. It reads way different then the voice acting shows.
[1:29:43] <%NovaKnightmare> I DONT UNDERSTAND
[1:29:46] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHA cough cough sputter
[1:29:47] <AdmiralButtloaf> evil laugh
[1:29:52] <%claudesavegely> huehuehue
[1:29:52] <%nitronLVIII> HAHA HAaaaaa
[1:29:53] <%spacekataz18> Clemps!
[1:29:53] <%sparrrow_> that sounded like some FFXV shit
[1:29:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> That was a good laugh.
[1:29:54] <%Chatterbox1991> DSP laugh
[1:29:55] <n3xus_nitro> hee hee haw haw
[1:29:55] <+jorgamund> "so, we're the bad guys AND we don't exist?? shit, I need to re-plan"
[1:29:55] <%AncelDeLambert> How is no-one stopping this man, who IS he?
[1:29:56] <+EvilSoully> He can respawn
[1:29:57] <themisticmist2000> H A H A!
[1:29:59] <%Remery_> Who walks away with their hands open?
[1:29:59] <%salty_syd913> thats the weakest evil laugh
[1:30:00] <sodium_station> "I love being evil" - Man who is Evil
[1:30:01] <%ElenaManetta> You got money for watching, just like a Twitch ad!
[1:30:01] <%lewdskeletor13> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[1:30:03] <+Trimoon333> seems like a well balanced individual
[1:30:03] <ArcticAsylum> pfffft
[1:30:05] <haisho> wait what I don't get it
[1:30:05] <%bonzosan> oh my god he is so evil
[1:30:07] <bearalin> H A H A
[1:30:08] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat Ascians believe the current state of reality to be a falsehood. The joining of all the worlds is the "true" reality
[1:30:09] <+EvilSoully> Ascians can respawn instantly without a specific way to kill him
[1:30:09] <%ElenaManetta> MYSTERIOUS
[1:30:10] <Polengoldur> hitler is telling stalin about how he's gonna nuke the universe and random guard #5 is just like "yeah ok"
[1:30:10] <mylesmoore> he's an illuminati ghost, can't kill him
[1:30:11] <%Fruitywhompus> is that a furry
[1:30:13] <%temsik> holy fuck he *does* sound like clemps
[1:30:13] <+sergeantsuperbeast> YEYEYE

[1:30:15] <deviljhojho94> WHAT
[1:30:16] <a_mad_dragon> PET THE PUPPY
[1:30:16] <ArcticAsylum> This shit is dumb
[1:30:17] <CarrotWhisky> Par-ley? Eh?
[1:30:17] <%Fidel_Castbro> yeyeyeye
[1:30:18] <arcaderabbit48> @Caidezes He can't. Solus could squash the Emperor like a bug. Trust me though, he wants to
[1:30:19] <Caivyre> TIME FOR THE RAP BATTLE
[1:30:19] <Artyom1198> ohhh
[1:30:19] <deviljhojho94> tomatoFear
[1:30:19] <+zaras00> !BIG PLOT!

[1:30:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> !racewar
[1:30:29] <RittiFruity> AWOOOOO
[1:30:29] <+JEiddew> @Caidezes Varis did do that earlier, then he just walked out from behind the throne again. Without SHITTONS of magic they can't be killed.
[1:30:29] <Worldbrand> Go beat up evil clemps
[1:30:30] <Tedidus> is he on pc?
[1:30:31] <+mecha_11> I still have no idea what's going on but the giant wolf man is my favorite.
[1:30:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Alec_The_Risktaker That sounds like it'd destroy everything.
[1:30:32] <CarrotWhisky> Best part inc!
[1:30:32] <deviljhojho94> tfw you only watch ginger streamers tomatoDevious
[1:30:33] <$Niney_Who> Pat a dog got in the house again

[1:30:44] <%CubicPhantom> Enough of that silly evil chitchat nonsense it's time for lesser dog
[1:30:45] <%Disname23> Quest Accepted: Start the fucking race war
[1:30:47] <arcaderabbit48> This patch is like 90% cutscenes, but goddamn are they good ones
[1:30:48] <CarrotWhisky> @Tedidus PS4, although FFXIV is cross-play between PC and PS4
[1:30:49] <deviljhojho94> RACE WAR RACE WAR
[1:30:51] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Not before!
[1:30:53] <+JEiddew> i hate this upcoming part because it's trying to make a black-and-white issue grey
[1:30:54] <%aishman> By the way, I love how there's like, those two soldiers there going "What in the fuck are we listening to?
[1:30:57] <%Reizie_Etherealm> OwO What's this? A war to cause a calamity?
[1:30:58] <%lewdskeletor13> RACE WAR apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:31:01] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @commanderclaw Kappa mhm
[1:31:04] <+shirimegane> Yo Pat when did you drop from being a Roe?
[1:31:08] <%Caidezes> So the villain has MMO plot armor. Got it.
[1:31:10] <%gespenst25> @caidezes he did that last patch just because he was so mad at him. then he walked from behind a curtain alive again
[1:31:12] <%SinisterBroccoli> Can you not warp from the map on ps4?
[1:31:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought that said Gay Albania.
[1:31:14] <Foggysheep> the race war starts now!
[1:31:16] <%Ahack13> Dungeon time?
[1:31:21] <arcaderabbit48> @JEiddew Its really not though. Every character present slams the "grey" side down pretty much immediately.
[1:31:24] <%SimplesRock> *balls
[1:31:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's FINE
[1:31:25] <%Remery_> his small ginger bones

[1:31:35] <matouci> Ascians are wierd spirit ghosts that posess people
[1:31:40] <ComradeConquistador> It's fine.
[1:31:40] <%rose_silver> @AngriestPat why dont you directly teleport from the map?
[1:31:42] <MidnightSnack69> its a big ole mess of cut scene
[1:31:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige probably loves those bones
[1:31:47] <%badchoice5> What do you mean Pat? Surely this will tie up all the loose ends in this ongoing MMO!
[1:31:48] <guppy_> final cutscene 14
[1:31:48] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, how much plot are they gonna force all at once?
[1:31:50] <+JEiddew> I have a whole lot of complaints about this that I won't scream in to the void about.
[1:31:51] <%eyedol33> You sure its not BONEITIS?
[1:31:52] <SchroedingersFerret> Why do people have butt plugs over their heads?
[1:31:54] <+JEiddew> @AncelDeLambert a whole lot
[1:31:55] <bearalin> I feel plot coming
[1:31:57] <themisticmist2000> y so much cutscenes?

[1:32:03] <%AncelDeLambert> nooooooo!
[1:32:03] <%SimplesRock> it's woolie!
[1:32:04] <ReiDuran> BOO LYSE
[1:32:07] <CarrotWhisky> @Fruitywhompus After this cutscene.
[1:32:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Patman and WHO'S TALKING?

[1:32:35] <fiercefiresoul> Lyse is hot but she's also SHIT.
[1:32:36] <%Jon64s> Watching ff14 almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
[1:32:36] <%Fidel_Castbro> leave my waifu alone
[1:32:38] <+shirimegane> Oh man THATS Hien's english voice? Don't regret switching to JPN when I started playing at all
[1:32:39] <%afronooch> Alla migos?
[1:32:40] <%Big_Dream> Why is mitsurigi in this game
[1:32:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Someobody find this small lady some fucking pants.
[1:32:43] <arcaderabbit48> Why do people hate Lyse so much? Like I don't love the lady, but I dont hate her either
[1:32:44] <+sergeantsuperbeast> Boo Lyse but Fuck Yeah Raubahn so it kinda balances out
[1:32:47] <RamenRiderZ> Hi Lord Hien HeyGuys
[1:32:49] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @simplesrock That can’t be Woolie; he’s never interact with a long-haired woman.
[1:32:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Someone put the kid in daycare already
[1:32:50] <Plague_bagel> are they saying booo? or buu-urns?
[1:32:53] <%Ahack13> What's your guys problem with Lyse?
[1:32:54] <%SimplesRock> When do you kill Lu Bu?
[1:32:54] <%Fruitywhompus> that child has a full grown woman voice
[1:32:56] <KoyaMusa> pat you were THERE
[1:33:00] <%Fidel_Castbro> he's in a coma
[1:33:00] <+blastazoid26> LUL
[1:33:01] <JoshyJ> hes got ligma
[1:33:02] <+dodge_and_dust> he is in a coma
[1:33:05] <Tedidus> wait is that lady lunafyra?
[1:33:05] <+KhoiSenpai> Has pat done Ivalice?
[1:33:07] <ComradeConquistador> BOO THISLY-Who the fuck is Lyse?
[1:33:09] <%ElenaManetta> Aiphinaud! In the hoooouuuse
[1:33:12] <AlasterAngelo> what's ligma?
[1:33:13] <sodium_station> "shit's fucked"
[1:33:14] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s got sugma
[1:33:15] <derekwst3> im gassy
[1:33:15] <+jorgamund> so... NO bad news then?
[1:33:16] <wolfen091> so im guessing the goofy ugly muthafucker is pats character?
[1:33:18] <+SWFanatic> i love toxic gas
[1:33:25] <%ElenaManetta> Pat is the hot lady
[1:33:26] <CarrotWhisky> @arcaderabbit48 I guess she's not as interesting as Aymric? Most of the Stormblood MSQ was also involved most in Othard and not in Gyr Arbania, so Lyse's backstory from there is not as involved?
[1:33:29] <+dodge_and_dust> has ANYONE ever snappd out of these comas?
[1:33:29] <%Disname23> Everything is fucked but other than that we're fine I guess
[1:33:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @wolfen091 He does stick out, doesn't he?
[1:33:38] <PowerWeightedCell> when is raubahn going to get a new arm
[1:33:44] <fiercefiresoul> No one has ever snapped out of these comas. They're a recent development.
[1:33:47] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @dodge_and_dust not in the 2 patches that they've been present in
[1:33:48] <%Voidwyvern> @dodge_and_dust nope
[1:33:52] <Gorgen> kinda sounds like a bootleg sean bean
[1:33:53] <KangarooCyborg> !uptime
[1:33:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m.
[1:33:54] <%ElenaManetta> Pat just throw your controller away you don't need it
[1:33:55] <%g0dhand9876> All we need is some tyranids and then everything is definitely fucked
[1:33:59] <123456789101112131415161> ResidentSleeper
[1:34:00] <%CubicPhantom> anti-magic gas masks

[1:34:01] <derekwst3> Pat drink water
[1:34:03] <SeventyForce> p u t o n t h e g a s
[1:34:05] <PowerWeightedCell> Yda = good. Lyse = bad
[1:34:06] <%claudesavegely> the best part of these cutscenes is synced body gestures
[1:34:06] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Gorgen dude that's so weird I thought the same thing
[1:34:07] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Everyone get into the magic dark showers
[1:34:09] <Caivyre> Raubahn better get a robo-arm in 5.0
[1:34:12] <+shirimegane> GAIUS IS SO DAMN COOL
[1:34:13] <ScreamingMeat> Raubahn look like a Arishok from DA2
[1:34:13] <arcaderabbit48> @CarrotWhisky That's fair. Shame she had to measure up to Aymeric. Nobody is gonna look good next to that fine piece of Elven ass
[1:34:17] <ArcticAsylum> Get a bunch of industrial fans and blow it back at them
[1:34:34] <bearalin> “On the bright side, nothing else could go wrong”
[1:34:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Exposition apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[1:34:39] <%badchoice5> This is way more plot and voice acting than I would have expected from an MMO
[1:34:43] <alrobot2014> is everyone gonna die?
[1:34:45] <therealestfraud> The reason i quit caring about this story when i played is the fact that everything is always "shits fucked but we're fine i guess?"
[1:34:46] <RamenRiderZ> Raubahn gets the BIONIC ARM and beats the SHIT out of SOLUS
[1:34:48] <Gorgen> why is Hanzo here
[1:34:51] <%AncelDeLambert> "Hey, guys, turns out this entire war has been a fuckup.... mulligan?"
[1:34:51] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @badchoice5 yeah welcome to 13
[1:34:53] <CarrotWhisky> Hm, black plague, while WoW have the Blight. What's up with MMO and toxic chemical warfare?
[1:34:58] <+MyDarkStorm> @badchoice5 Famous Last Words
[1:34:59] <%Fidel_Castbro> pfft not until the second half of the 4.5 clearly
[1:35:00] <+sergeantsuperbeast> 14 rather
[1:35:01] <KoyaMusa> remember how solus could mold hosts? yeah that's interesting
[1:35:10] <kayshot> Pat lemme lick those gingerballs.
[1:35:10] <sodium_station> oh that's kinda fucked and messed up
[1:35:13] <%gespenst25> @caidezes Ascians can steal the bodies of others and turn them into copies of themselves. they can be permanently lkilled by trapping their spirit in a medium and then destroying it but it's a massive ball-ache to do. technically the main character can survive death and possess bodies too although they don't know how
[1:35:15] <+jorgamund> @CarrotWhisky easy excuse for zones of zombies
[1:35:17] <%g0dhand9876> The alliance, what is this a crossover?

[1:35:52] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @derekwst3 Thancred's in a coma
[1:35:56] <CarrotWhisky> Why negotiate when all WoL can nod or do head side-tilts?

[1:36:14] <%Disname23> The silent protagonist, master of politics and rhetoric
[1:36:14] <%afronooch> I've had it with these disingenuous negotiations
[1:36:16] <Asper_Usual> this seems really unbalanced in favor of getting a bunch of high level Alliance leaders in one room
[1:36:16] <derekwst3> crazy talk
[1:36:18] <Fordrilin> Outside of Krile but shes back in...that place
[1:36:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Negotiate if they can go to heaven or hell after you cut them up

[1:36:46] <+shirimegane> I hate how Highlander Hyurs have no damn eyebrows
[1:36:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's character looks like he's trying to be Auron and failing
[1:36:52] <sodium_station> bunch of main characters in one room means shit hits the fan

[1:37:39] <arcaderabbit48> It has a ton of lead up, but I really enjoyed the dungeon we got. "Dungeon" here meaning "giant robot race war"
[1:37:40] <+sergeantsuperbeast> I almost feel bad for the people who came here expecting gameplay and not a geopolitical soap opera
[1:37:40] <derekwst3> darn Pat is back
[1:37:42] <kingdudeby> Is there actual gameplay in this or is it just characters never shutting the fuck up
[1:37:43] <%JJCheeker> His character looks like he drink too much Gamer goo

[1:38:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatMenace
[1:38:09] <fiercefiresoul> I love how there are people in here, watching a game that is also an RPG, expecting more gameplay than talking.
[1:38:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have a small chair.
[1:38:13] <+Mexrage> hope nobody brought drinks to the negotation, we have a very bad luck streak with those in the past

[1:38:51] <%lewdskeletor13> @fiercefiresoul It’s just been a bunch of cutscenes with barely any player input, it’s an exposition dump

[1:39:28] <sodium_station> She's about as big as his helmet HAHA
[1:39:28] <+SWFanatic> thats a stupid name and a stupid face
[1:39:28] <+Sambin0> this is so boring to watch
[1:39:31] <thelonechris> A potato negotiates with a chandelier
[1:39:32] <+mecha_11> BibleThump
[1:39:34] <booglesnurf> Time to make French fries
[1:39:34] <%Ahack13> Thats not a great pick Nanamo...
[1:39:35] <%Jpdodds> This Shao Khan looking guy
[1:39:36] <thepowerofpinsol> sayPotato
[1:39:36] <Foggysheep> hes gonna eat that potato
[1:39:38] <%lizard0tm> All those dead stares
[1:39:38] <Psyramics> this is a terrible argument
[1:39:39] <%Ahack13> pitch*
[1:39:40] <fiercefiresoul> If I recall, isn't all Garlean armor powered armor in some way? Especially armor like Varis is wearing?
[1:39:45] <ReiDuran> Wow Nanamo what is shit way to put it
[1:39:47] <%SimplesRock> nah, I still dig watching. it's chill and WEIRD
[1:39:48] <%furiousfurioso> We'll get ya eventually! Probably! Good speech
[1:39:49] <Gorgen> That chickk is HOT
[1:39:49] <%Ahack13> You could TOTALLY beat us in a war.
[1:39:50] <Nordguy> i want to taste that white haired lady's cooking
[1:39:53] <arcaderabbit48> Nanamo is a great character, but her being a Potato makes so many of her scenes incredibly awkward
[1:39:53] <%AncelDeLambert> I said it when moobot gagged me and I'll say it again now, this is some Star Wars shit
[1:39:56] <+chronopaladin> this diplomatic meeting doesn't have enough god slaying
[1:39:56] <%g0dhand9876> Arm wrestle!!!!!
[1:39:58] <+ZeekZaku> crush potatoes head
[1:40:00] <%NovaKnightmare> "Why is this irish snack talking to me?"
[1:40:03] <KangarooCyborg> Pat's character looks kinda like DMC Dante
[1:40:05] <derekwst3> potato used talk no jutsu…...
[1:40:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Look at this space politics shit
[1:40:06] <+CeeSaw> Is this a weird fan made porn

[1:40:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> make mashed potatoes
[1:40:09] <+Aztec50> im thinking this is not a great place to experience this game's story for the first time
[1:40:11] <Foggysheep> glass him

[1:40:17] <%maskedriderhero> sophistry?
[1:40:20] <coldnoid> as you know
[1:40:21] <CarrotWhisky> @fiercefiresoul Not really? I think closest are those pugilists with power-fist-like arms.
[1:40:21] <derekwst3> it wasn't that effective......
[1:40:21] <%JoeJotaro> why is this irish currency talking to me
[1:40:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> SIGN THIS TREATY!
[1:40:24] <%ahalfeatenchocolateorange> "who let this child sit at the adult table?" - villain

[1:40:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Dude, your entire war is a lie, why you actin' smug?
[1:40:26] <MidnightSnack69> i thought this scene was quite fascinating
[1:40:30] <%Jpdodds> *beastmen*
[1:40:30] <+SeaBassTheLad> Garlemand did nothing wromg
[1:40:31] <%gespenst25> he prefers Epicureanism
[1:40:31] <+JEiddew> RIP (not actually) Merlwyb's old VA. She was so good and I miss her.
[1:40:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @maskedriderhero Fancy words and pathos.
[1:40:32] <+ShlickShlocks> Is Pay pulling a DSP and fapping live on stream?
[1:40:36] <%NovaKnightmare> Emperor brings up racism super casually
[1:40:36] <$ooblagis> I hate when stories get lazy and say an evil Empire is winning a war, despite only ever showing examples of them losing, over and over again
[1:40:38] <+DoktahDoktah> Its an HR issue were investigating.
[1:40:39] <Caivyre> pat stop fapping to nanamo
[1:40:40] <%afronooch> (((beastmen)))
[1:40:40] <+Akiraz84> I like this Varis fella, except for like one major part of his argument
[1:40:46] <%Jpdodds> fucking BEASTMEN?!
[1:40:47] <%gespenst25> like Garlemald isnt divided?
[1:40:49] <CarrotWhisky> Ah, the Roman EMpire-ideal.
[1:40:51] <+SeaBassTheLad> Garlemand did nothing wrong
[1:40:59] <+jorgamund> he just called a whole group of nations a bunch of pussies
[1:41:02] <%NovaKnightmare> Empires are cooler than alliances but theyre always evil
[1:41:02] <+DoktahDoktah> This is a great time for betrayal.
[1:41:04] <+SWFanatic> beastmen? Is this twilight?
[1:41:04] <%NeonTurnip> anyone have a suggestion of a class to play in wow I liked playing hunter and arms/fury warrior

[1:41:11] <%g0dhand9876> If I'm ever in court remind me to wear big armour
[1:41:12] <Caivyre> Garlemald did nothing wrong
[1:41:14] <%Shadowthedigger> I mean Garlamald is only loosing cause the PC exists.
[1:41:16] <Gorgen> quiet Honzo
[1:41:21] <%SimplesRock> pixelated armor jeez

[1:41:30] <arcaderabbit48> @ooblagis Well, Dalmasca is super fucked, and last patch involved an entire uprising being destroyed by toxic gas?
[1:41:39] <+JEiddew> tension
[1:41:41] <derekwst3> Lu Bu used glare
[1:41:42] <+JEiddew> theme of tension
[1:41:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Big grumps
[1:41:44] <%afronooch> @AncelDeLambert Caesar Salads are pretty okay
[1:41:45] <42nfl19> Does Pat's character not have his own voice lines? At least in GW2 they prerecord the same lines multiple times with diff people for diff races
[1:41:46] <ReiDuran> Varis: "Are we the bad guys?"
[1:41:47] <+ZeekZaku> tin man mad
[1:41:48] <KoyaMusa> NO IT'S NOT

[1:41:53] <+mecha_11> Put the adorable baby diplomat back on screen.
[1:41:54] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YOU DID IT NOT US
[1:41:55] <%Shadowthedigger> They'd kick everyones ass if they didn't A: keep getting internally destabilized and B: didn't have guys at the top purposefully fucking things up.
[1:41:55] <Ghost__Pantsu> My god those shoulder pads are lobosGasm
[1:41:56] <%claudesavegely> oh you bitch
[1:41:56] <%g0dhand9876> Objection!!!

[1:42:03] <frostyaod> our people will die before we let garlam kill us
[1:42:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's not WRONG exactly.
[1:42:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Peace? SHUT UP!
[1:42:05] <+CamTasticS> is this a game or movie
[1:42:07] <%Skeletorexplains> I talked to Frieza, he said he didn't do it
[1:42:10] <sodium_station> Isn't this Caesar's logic in New Vegas
[1:42:10] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> NO U
[1:42:11] <+DoktahDoktah> That guy looks like a cross between The Heavy and Geralt!
[1:42:13] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Caivyre) (warning)
[1:42:13] <%vaporousTippler> This fucker just looks like the old FF bosses who were 10 times bigger than your characters.
[1:42:13] <$Yakobro> @CamTasticS yes
[1:42:15] <+chronopaladin> yo dawg, I thought we were being diplomatic
[1:42:16] <%ElenaManetta> Would Pat die for freedom or would he be a government snitch?
[1:42:16] <%NovaKnightmare> "uh yea basically."
[1:42:17] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL this is literally a Monty Python sketch but serious LUL
[1:42:17] <+jorgamund> I mean, if it'll get the boot off your face, maybe you give it a little lick...
[1:42:17] <%afronooch> You steal mens souls and make them your slaves
[1:42:17] <%badchoice5> "Yeah pretty much"

[1:42:31] <$monkeyhous3> THE GREATER GOOOOD
[1:42:31] <arcaderabbit48> @afronooch The same could be said of all nations
[1:42:32] <%Skeletorexplains> #Friezawasright
[1:42:32] <%TheSpiritof2277> Heroes on both sides?
[1:42:33] <suikudo> that is an unrealistic amount of wrong coming out of his face
[1:42:33] <%edgeyberzerker> Varis wears those shoulder pads because he's insecure
[1:42:33] <%NovaKnightmare> RELEASE SUPER BAHUMUT
[1:42:33] <$Yakobro> @CamTasticS when there's a super long sequence of cutscenes it has to warn you LUL

[1:42:58] <sodium_station> Is real life a constant loop of shitty politics and endless war
[1:43:00] <$KnivesEve> the greater good
[1:43:00] <%gespenst25> setting up this kind of meeting would take weeks by tiseof....
[1:43:03] <CarrotWhisky> @AlasterAngelo Well Ivalice is demolished by the Empire but if you mean Eorzea, then yeah, lots of politics involved in warfare.
[1:43:03] <%g0dhand9876> Smooth skin
[1:43:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Time out! Time out! We should've thought of better arguments than this!
[1:43:05] <%valriot> GET EM DAD

[1:43:22] <MidnightSnack69> there WAS a papacy
[1:43:23] <HeadsHeldHigh> "Again, no u"
[1:43:24] <SailingSaturn> with Violence LUL
[1:43:27] <%NovaKnightmare> you cant negoiate with a dragon
[1:43:27] <%CubicPhantom> but if you had won that war you'd be singing a different tune
[1:43:30] <+JEiddew> niddhogg wouldn't have let him drown
[1:43:32] <%Thatghostpepper> yep there WAS
[1:43:33] <Plague_bagel> hes far too handsome
[1:43:35] <%Fidel_Castbro> All I'm saying is let's have a representative battle
[1:43:35] <+jorgamund> SICK BURN, VARIS
[1:43:36] <RamenRiderZ> yEaH bUt YoU kIlLeD tHo
[1:43:36] <%FrustratedAF> alright i haven't been paying attention but clearly you shouldn't trust this man Varris
[1:43:37] <derekwst3> Crazy talk
[1:43:37] <ColRedyx> Varis just calling everyone the fuck out.
[1:43:39] <Valask> look at his codpiece
[1:43:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Dragons don't negotiate, they rampage
[1:43:41] <Gorgen> who is this bootleg Arthas
[1:43:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> He's actually right lol
[1:43:45] <%cureneckbeard> Aymeric's voice actor is a couple of guys in Dark Souls
[1:43:46] <Basch71> these call outs LuL
[1:43:46] <%furtivestinbro> god look at that jawline
[1:43:48] <%Disname23> CALLED THE FUCK OUT
[1:43:49] <ScreamingMeat> Wait dragons?
[1:43:49] <PowerWeightedCell> Daaaaang Varis going in PogChamp
[1:43:50] <KoyaMusa> niddhogg was a warmonger, and they parleyed with hraesvelgr
[1:43:57] <+DoktahDoktah> Guys... Did.... Did Varis did nothing wrong?
[1:43:59] <%NovaKnightmare> Might makes right?
[1:44:00] <+chronopaladin> sometimes you gotta break some eikons to make an omelette
[1:44:01] <Valask> I love this guy PogChamp
[1:44:01] <+blastazoid26> DAMN, NO COMEBACK
[1:44:01] <HeadsHeldHigh> Nidhogg was genociding
[1:44:02] <enoughmold> Hi
[1:44:03] <+Can_Do_Kamel> Look at that horned hitler.
[1:44:04] <%g0dhand9876> Daddy burn
[1:44:05] <Mastigias> ooooh snap
[1:44:05] <%KaironFortressKnight> Might controls EVERYTHING
[1:44:05] <BlueLunecy> He ALSO summoned a primal so y'know
[1:44:06] <%Arnschen> Ooof
[1:44:07] <%valriot> HE WENT TO SPACE
[1:44:07] <$monkeyhous3> oof
[1:44:09] <+jorgamund> daaaaaaamn dragon boy got shut down
[1:44:10] <%SimplesRock> where's the comeback. come on gang!
[1:44:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The intention with said strength also matters but eh
[1:44:13] <%brave_sj> Just kill him and be done with it
[1:44:13] <%cureneckbeard> Don't make me tap the Bors comic
[1:44:13] <CarrotWhisky> Note how Varis does not use this same tactic against Aymric when he spoke against Raubahn. It's because he can't actually refute Raubahn's argument.
[1:44:15] <TyrantBelial> All's fair in war.
[1:44:16] <bearalin> Welp the Daddy card
[1:44:17] <arcaderabbit48> This is explicitly wrong, Nidhoggr was crazy and even several of the dragons were saying "Yeah no, take him out"
[1:44:18] <+Akiraz84> VARIS VARIS VARIS
[1:44:21] <RamenRiderZ> Now who's next?
[1:44:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Ishgard is a country name that sounds like you bit your tongue
[1:44:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fidel_Castbro) (warning)
[1:44:25] <suikudo> The fuck was even the point of this meeting!? they knew damn well nothing good was going to come of this
[1:44:25] <TheEnablerr> Emperor = 3 Alliance = 0
[1:44:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> He's like a compelling Griffith, oh no
[1:44:26] <%gespenst25> there was a papal state but it uh, disolved... its a parliamentary democracy
[1:44:27] <%CJett92> Ya, but you got a forehead nipple so nyeh
[1:44:28] <+ZeekZaku> armor chad
[1:44:29] <%NovaKnightmare> if the Emperor bowed his head, he'd stab his eye
[1:44:31] <TyrantBelial> Varis is right, he's just means.
[1:44:34] <%Cainhurstcrow> This feels like when my DnD group tried to go against the big bad in a battle of words, and we were very, very, unprepared for it.
[1:44:34] <Plague_bagel> when your entire crew gets roasted by the new kid
[1:44:35] <%KnightsoftheOnion> standing grumpy face
[1:44:36] <TyrantBelial> *he's just mean
[1:44:36] <+aidanqueen7> uhnPi
[1:44:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Why do people love agreeing with evil dictators?
[1:44:40] <%pectusumbra> can't they just gank him here at the table?
[1:44:40] <%SimplesRock> @TheEnablerr keep that score going. might be another one here
[1:44:47] <CarrotWhisky> @suikudo Exposition to give the Empire's perspective.
[1:44:53] <+RC_S3kshun8> Dude looks evil
[1:44:53] <+DoktahDoktah> Varis did nothing wrong.
[1:44:54] <%cureneckbeard> Chung-chung! Magitek armor!
[1:44:55] <+Sambin0> okay im out, this is too boring
[1:44:57] <+Can_Do_Kamel> Totally not evil you guys.

[1:45:04] <+ZeekZaku> hahahaha
[1:45:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> ?>
[1:45:10] <RamenRiderZ> Not my Merlwyb
[1:45:11] <Commander_Spyke> So says the PIRATE
[1:45:12] <@Squishy3> @KoyaMusa you forget that hraesvelgr was also complicit in the war as ishgard had both of nidhogg's eyes and hraesvelgr gave him one of his
[1:45:12] <prime_name> Is that the name?
[1:45:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I cannot take this woman seriously when she has a cockney accent
[1:45:12] <MidnightSnack69> he's 'right' in a really tone deaf, only-looking-from-one-direction kind of way. which isnt very right at all.
[1:45:14] <+zaras00> youre kinda way the last person who should be talkin here mer
[1:45:14] <+ZeekZaku> J

[1:45:21] <$Niney_Who> god I hope so
[1:45:21] <+jorgamund> this is just a backstory vs backstory battle
[1:45:22] <%SimplesRock> but all the burns have failed!

[1:45:31] <CarrotWhisky> Remember that Y'Shtola criticized Merlwyb for taking over kobolds land waaaay back in 2.2? I'm glad Varis showed her place.
[1:45:31] <%g0dhand9876> It's varis roast
[1:45:32] <Fordrilin> Varis - The Burn [Ultimate]
[1:45:33] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> They didn't rob their neighbors of life and liberty, they just robbed their neighbors.

[1:46:34] <%pectusumbra> so is this just a rap battle but talking?
[1:46:36] <fiercefiresoul> This entire meeting is basically 'lol imperialism is good' 'no it's not shut up' 'you're just imperialists of a different nature' 'OH NO WE ARE but screw you tho'
[1:46:37] <arcaderabbit48> @JEiddew Yeah, its weird. She sits back down like he burned her but he really didnt??
[1:46:38] <ScrapSentinel> Varis did nothing wrong
[1:46:40] <CarrotWhisky> Yeah, I don't get Varis rebuttal here, considering they called for the Twelve when Nael of the Empire threatened to call the freaking Moon upon the Eorzea.
[1:46:41] <%g0dhand9876> Hes handing them out like oprah
[1:46:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @furtivestinbro I know right? Varis is winning this conversation.
[1:46:46] <%SimplesRock> where's the burn!?

[1:47:09] <Valask> rofl
[1:47:10] <+SWFanatic> Harvey Birdman?
[1:47:10] <sodium_station> I don't remember much of the tree huggers but they DID do something bad right, that's what Varis is referring to
[1:47:12] <TheEnablerr> Emperor = 5 Alliance = get out
[1:47:12] <+LinkyBinky> Buy you brought down Dalamud and almost ended the world
[1:47:13] <+mecha_11> He laughs and at every heave his chestplate slams into his ribs.
[1:47:13] <arcaderabbit48> "We think we should improve society a little" to which Varis responds "YET YOU PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY HMMM HOW STRANGE"
[1:47:13] <suikudo> Absolutly fucking nothing
[1:47:15] <+UKOrigin> yeah to save the world from LITERAL BURNING DEATH WTF XD
[1:47:16] <%CJett92> Armor: 4 Potatoes: 1
[1:47:16] <ScrapSentinel> DUNKED
[1:47:18] <%FrostMass22> This ain't no Star Trek
[1:47:18] <%Das_Bass> I like this guy
[1:47:22] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Invoke the twelve because Bahamut was ALREADY threatening all of creation. And who brought Bahamut down?
[1:47:22] <%maskedriderhero> Quick, dog pile him and murder his ass
[1:47:23] <KoyaMusa> @Squishy3 no i haven't, what i mean that ending the dragonsong war was not as varis says
[1:47:23] <Valask> "Y'all are worthless, fuck you"
[1:47:24] <weareone1gaming> I like this dude
[1:47:25] <TyrantBelial> I love how he doesn't even attempt to be polite with her.
[1:47:26] <+EvilSoully> In the distant past, the tree huggers almost blow up the world

[1:47:33] <AlasterAngelo> what do you mean you people
[1:47:34] <%KaironFortressKnight> Not our stuff
[1:47:35] <+RC_S3kshun8> did I just see a fucking GENJI?
[1:47:36] <CarrotWhisky> Yeah, but you get citizenship of the Empire!
[1:47:38] <derekwst3> just do it
[1:47:38] <%AncelDeLambert> The writers read Il Principe and took it seriously
[1:47:40] <%Arnschen> Yes, here is this olive branch. That is all you own now.
[1:47:43] <+IronPickle> Kill that child
[1:47:46] <%gespenst25> Kan-e-senna is on slightly firmer ground than Merlywbb since she's the representative of the spirits that the first actually belongs to and only people who don't fuck with them can stay
[1:47:51] <%lewdskeletor13> This guys such a prick
[1:47:54] <%Disname23> Fuck you Alisaie
[1:47:55] <%SimplesRock> I need... more shoulder armor

[1:48:01] <%Remery_> He has a big chair
[1:48:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lewdskeletor13 Yes, but he's not been really wrong.
[1:48:03] <AlasterAngelo> GIVE ME WAR
[1:48:04] <Gregorhasjoined> Thats the problem, violence is his FIRST resort, maybe only.
[1:48:06] <AlasterAngelo> GIVE ME GAMEPLAY
[1:48:07] <TranquilTurnip> That guy is reaching 40k levels of paldrons
[1:48:07] <CarrotWhisky> @gespenst25 Good point. I forget that the Elementals allows people to live in Gridania.
[1:48:07] <%AncelDeLambert> who invited the child to the super serious meeting?
[1:48:08] <+jorgamund> why is Varis the only one who gets a fancy hat?
[1:48:10] <derekwst3> Lu Bu is right, Potatoes are not
[1:48:12] <Gorgen> shut up potato
[1:48:12] <kalinflip> wtf
[1:48:12] <RamenRiderZ> Here's the olive branch which I will whip you with

[1:48:24] <+blastazoid26> Shut up Alisae, i want more sick burns
[1:48:25] <%Ml33tninja> Shoot this prick in the head and dump him in a hole
[1:48:27] <%lewdskeletor13> @commandersqueaks He seems like a super evil dictator tho
[1:48:28] <KangarooCyborg> Potatoes grow better in the dark
[1:48:28] <suikudo> these diplomats suck shit
[1:48:28] <Heartless_01> they have nothing to offer him LUL
[1:48:29] <%edgeyberzerker> Varis looks like he does need to pee
[1:48:30] <%crimsonharvest> is this the talk to soldiers minigame from FF6
[1:48:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Back to the drawing board everybody!
[1:48:30] <+kawachipto> I kinda want to punt that potato
[1:48:31] <kalinflip> atpClaire
[1:48:32] <%lizard0tm> So far the meeting seems to have been, "Hey, your people are really violent, here's why you shouldn't be"
[1:48:33] <+SWFanatic> suck his dick
[1:48:33] <$Niney_Who> Stab his Magic Kidneys

[1:48:38] <JT137> get some cure on our burns Kappa
[1:48:39] <arcaderabbit48> @CommanderSqueaks He's been wrong on at least two counts. The only one he's really right about was Merwyb, and that was over something that happened a long time ago.
[1:48:41] <%SimplesRock> you gotta suck the dick AND the balls
[1:48:41] <%g0dhand9876> The moogles send there regards
[1:48:41] <GingerSen> chat is violent tonight, oof
[1:48:42] <+ZeekZaku> you all have to eat a bowl of eggs or war now
[1:48:45] <blue6sub6remnant6> Man, what an amazing headpiece.
[1:48:45] <+Can_Do_Kamel> construct THIS *Shoots with gun*
[1:48:46] <%Remery_> @kawachipto so punt-able
[1:48:48] <%edgeyberzerker> and someone pulls out a shot gun
[1:48:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> just fuckin shoot him in the bad of the head
[1:48:49] <derekwst3> Bye LU BU
[1:48:51] <Frozen_phoenix> he just needs to hug someone to stab them.
[1:48:51] <%sparrrow_> SEDUCE HIM
[1:48:53] <%CJett92> W I D E B O I
[1:48:54] <+tigerfang86> SO EVIL
[1:48:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wonder how bad his balls chafe in that armor.
[1:48:55] <+jorgamund> Varis: 1, Potato League: 0
[1:48:56] <Gorgen> "it takes me 14 hours to put this shoulder armor on"
[1:48:56] <scrumbotime> He is very polite and good at sick burns and pauldroning
[1:48:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> And I pull out MY GUN
[1:48:56] <%AncelDeLambert> you know, competent writing would have all of this going on in the background, because in real life it takes forever and is BORING AS ASS
[1:48:58] <Foggysheep> glass him
[1:48:58] <TheEnablerr> Burns everyone, still takes the bait. VIDEOGAMES
[1:48:59] <Valask> SO EVIL
[1:49:00] <fehraf> man what a stupid hat
[1:49:01] <+Akiraz84> Varis could throw a sick psycho crusher
[1:49:02] <%Cainhurstcrow> This guys is a legitimately amazing bad guy. Holy shit, 10/10 on the team.
[1:49:03] <%FrustratedAF> so how many gameplay hours until he's dead?
[1:49:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@badchoice5)
[1:49:03] <%KaironFortressKnight> Dudes needs to slow down the shoulder work outs
[1:49:03] <SaltyAzteca> How do you not sweat in that armor
[1:49:03] <$monkeyhous3> they got shit on super hard
[1:49:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> All of you must make me a pizza or we GO TO WAR
[1:49:04] <mr_slaide> Those nerds got owned.
[1:49:05] <%SimplesRock> Kill him or seduce him?
[1:49:06] <%NovaKnightmare> Join the Empire pat!!
[1:49:06] <Gregorhasjoined> Constructive, says the man who just deflected and insulted every sitting table-member. Galvus is master at burns, failure at negotiation.
[1:49:06] <+Mexrage> or poisoned
[1:49:06] <AlasterAngelo> there is no way that armor is comfortable
[1:49:06] <Polengoldur> it must be hard to walk in that Luu Buu ass armour
[1:49:07] <Cranky_Construct> way to fuck up diplomacy everybody
[1:49:07] <$Niney_Who> "You all have to chug an entire gallon of mustard or I go to war"
[1:49:09] <%edgeyberzerker> Gotta say his burns were level 100
[1:49:10] <alrobot2014> is it time to go visit kefka in prision?
[1:49:11] <derekwst3> not yet
[1:49:11] <brambobelurkin> why are his pauldrons so large?
[1:49:11] <sodium_station> Good guys BLOWN the fuck out
[1:49:12] <%furiousfurioso> that went way better than I expected tbh
[1:49:12] <Commander_Spyke> His chair is way better than everyone else's rofl
[1:49:12] <%NovaKnightmare> I like his ideas!!
[1:49:15] <Psyramics> that always had to go badly for plot reasons
[1:49:17] <+SWFanatic> negotiations were not short
[1:49:18] <+DoktahDoktah> All right guys! Its half time! What's out plan to turn this around! *Sweats Profusely.*
[1:49:20] <alcors_wisdom> better than 80% of game of thrones meetings
[1:49:21] <anAngryHamster> I'm reminded why I don't care about these people
[1:49:22] <Mastigias> Diplomacy has failed!
[1:49:22] <CrypticMochi> Seduce him with your masculine wiles!
[1:49:24] <%CubicPhantom> this is why countries normally have official diplomancers. to avoid Sick-Burn-athons
[1:49:24] <%NovaKnightmare> Im not an imperial spy I swear
[1:49:27] <%Remery_> @Commander_Spyke he has a very expensive ass
[1:49:31] <monsturmun> buddy is like just surrender now and there will be peace
[1:49:33] <+BonusSkeleton> does anyone know if the story is actually good in XIV
[1:49:33] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat Why don't you just kill him though
[1:49:33] <%furtivestinbro> someone just get a gun and shoot him in his completely unguarded, perfectly chisled face.
[1:49:37] <%cureneckbeard> Yeah you aren't gonna do well trying to diplomacy a guy who shows up to the talks in full plate armour
[1:49:37] <JoeyDDT> Oh boy I can't wait until part 2 of this meeting
[1:49:39] <bearalin> Stabbing seems imminent
[1:49:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> I didn't realize we were gonna have a part two of The Burn
[1:49:43] <Worldbrand> i bet phoenix wright could bullshit his way through this
[1:49:44] <+jorgamund> Potato used guilt trip! It's not very effective.
[1:49:45] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> TEAM HUDDLE - They had us in the first half, not gon lie
[1:49:46] <%pectusumbra> yeah, he's stalling to make poison gas
[1:49:46] <%lewdskeletor13> Is New Vegas still happening tonight?
[1:49:48] <KoyaMusa> yeah pat, something weird is happening with the emperor, what do you think that is?
[1:49:48] <+miguelrod777> you'll see
[1:49:49] <%sparrrow_> maybe he's gonna poison gas you
[1:49:54] <CarrotWhisky> @TheSpiritof2277 LUL
[1:49:55] <$monkeyhous3> slow down goddamn pat
[1:49:55] <sodium_station> When you run out of Diplomatic Points
[1:49:56] <%gnarly_memes_bro> it was a clone probably
[1:49:58] <haisho> he's there to hope you give up so Solus doesn't do the Solus
[1:50:00] <TranquilTurnip> Is it dangerous for all these high profile people to be in one place?
[1:50:00] <derekwst3> can we eat potato?
[1:50:03] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> That was my thought as well "Let's bring our army to the border and then trap their strongest fighter in a stupid Meeting"
[1:50:04] <+shadowace2400> It feels like he's goigng to poison gas all the leaders
[1:50:05] <+tigerfang86> what if he was just a GUN
[1:50:08] <%pectusumbra> I mean I don't even play this game and I can tell that.
[1:50:09] <+ZeekZaku> fart gas
[1:50:12] <Max_Capacity> Wait... did pat do the patch reading??
[1:50:12] <ScreamingMeat> Imminent Fart Gas

[1:50:18] <CarrotWhisky> Unite the Eorzea Alliance against the Empire? Pull a LeLouch?
[1:50:19] <%PomegranateKing> "I came so that you might convince me not to MURDER. Too bad every time you talk I hear you begging me to MURDER you!"
[1:50:20] <%Fidel_Castbro> Varis does hate his Grandpa
[1:50:21] <herrcepo> I was expecting him to pull a Goldfinger and gas everyone.
[1:50:21] <%furtivestinbro> dude wants an out?
[1:50:23] <Angry_Ev1L> that's exactly what he wants
[1:50:23] <+Flambage> Stab him before he can stab you! It is the only way!
[1:50:24] <%Disname23> Fart Gas is being prepared
[1:50:24] <booglesnurf> Captain's log supplemental: Things did not go as planned.
[1:50:26] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Make me at least 10 friendship letters each or we go to war
[1:50:31] <scrumbotime> "KILL MY BAD GRANDPA"
[1:50:32] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat what if he got you all in one room to kill you
[1:50:32] <%Remery_> Kill Granddad he's has a young body and is constantly being cheeky
[1:50:36] <TheEnablerr> More sick burns coming soon!

[1:50:54] <Dreigun> I've been out of the MMO scene for a while (since Cataclysm in WoW). Is FF14 in a good place to pick up for casual play?
[1:50:55] <KangarooCyborg> Just keep pumping gas in for like 4 hours

[1:51:15] <arcaderabbit48> @Dreigun Yeah, definitely. Has a very slow start, but its free up to level 35
[1:51:15] <%SimplesRock> "we offer an old fashioned in apology"
[1:51:16] <suikudo> Jesus fuck this is a shit show
[1:51:20] <applesonthemoon> if only there was poisonous gas or something
[1:51:21] <+Akiraz84> Queue the race war
[1:51:22] <sodium_station> "Sorry we got blown the fuck out"
[1:51:23] <%maskedriderhero> Pat alone could probably fight him
[1:51:24] <Mr_Strut> Sorry for the sick burns, bitch
[1:51:24] <+AltunRes> Can we rekill nanamo before 5.0?
[1:51:26] <%NovaKnightmare> what a nice lil potato
[1:51:27] <CarrotWhisky> Everyone is a fighter except of Nanamo.
[1:51:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> You are the equivalent of a warrior jesus at this point
[1:51:30] <RamenRiderZ> "Right, who's the next bitch who needs telling"
[1:51:31] <ColRedyx> Hien can hold his own too.
[1:51:33] <derekwst3> no one can beat lu bu
[1:51:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nanamo is a summon to Raubahn Kappa
[1:51:36] <TheBigO75> Just power up and kill the bitch
[1:51:39] <CarrotWhisky> Pipin represents Nanamo on the battlefield.
[1:51:40] <PowerWeightedCell> all merlwyb does is shoot at things and yell SEVEN HELLS
[1:51:42] <%RaikenTB> @AltunRes Why? BibleThump
[1:51:42] <+miguelrod777> you got rocked by zeno before you powered up
[1:51:48] <+UKOrigin> kan-e senna is an insane level white mage, she wouldnt let the poison even touch them
[1:51:49] <%TheSpiritof2277> Nanamo's a good projectile in a combat scenario
[1:51:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, we're still watching this
[1:51:55] <Dreigun> @arcaderabbit48 I tried to do that the other day, but I'm ineligible for the trial since I played a 14 day free trial like 4 years ago, haha
[1:51:55] <%JoeJotaro> Ms. Potato and the rest took an L and now theyre apologizing. what a bunch of losers
[1:51:55] <+AltunRes> @RaikenTB 80% cause she's lala
[1:51:58] <+Mexrage> Nanamo is a Beastmaster, she command the Bull of Ala'Mhigo
[1:51:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Manifest Destiny!
[1:52:00] <+AltunRes> @RaikenTB 20% cause I dont like her
[1:52:02] <+jorgamund> now they're discussing him as if he's not here
[1:52:06] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, the writers are trying to make politics, oh no
[1:52:12] <+EvilSoully> Yeah, Kan-E-Senna is low key the world most powerful mage still left alive
[1:52:13] <Covil91> I didn't realize Pat still played 14.
[1:52:15] <Valask> fuck these talks, just storm the room with knives
[1:52:16] <+ZeekZaku> Palestine for Palpatine
[1:52:16] <+Ciphris> raubahn and merlwyb are also pretty much equals to WoL
[1:52:18] <+ClumsyYoukai> no don't worry they have an... incredible plan
[1:52:28] <arcaderabbit48> @Dreigun Oh shit, that sucks! I'd still say its a great game, but I can understand being hesitant to jump in at that point
[1:52:28] <kingdudeby> I wouldn't call this playing
[1:52:31] <+UKOrigin> have you not played this game? its politics for years lol
[1:52:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't express this intensely enough: do NOT do this!
[1:52:34] <derekwst3> Pat looks upset
[1:52:34] <ColRedyx> @AncelDeLambert FF is a lot better at politics than most things... like romance.
[1:52:34] <RekknLIVE> hanzo?
[1:52:38] <%Ahack13> Wait
[1:52:38] <PowerWeightedCell> how can they be equals? they dont do shit to primals
[1:52:40] <+ClumsyYoukai> the writers have a real hamfisted way of writing lol
[1:52:44] <AlasterAngelo> Pat always looks upset
[1:52:46] <%Ahack13> Are they actually putting something together?
[1:52:46] <+Zaver88> OH MAN IT'S HITLER TIME
[1:52:47] <kalinflip> clay face atpClaire
[1:52:50] <%AncelDeLambert> @ColRedyx that scares me

[1:55:09] <+zaras00> I feel like he's super hamming it up to tell us what's happening without telling us
[1:55:09] <CarrotWhisky> There's been theory that Varis is intentionally playing up, as a puppet according to Solus wishes.

[2:03:22] <TheEnablerr> Pat stares at: FFXIV the Movie
[2:03:26] <KangarooCyborg> We need a race war emote
[2:03:29] <Endocrom> What WERE you expecting from a guy with armor that evil looking?
[2:03:30] <derekwst3> im going to bed night everyone
[2:03:31] <gustavozxd> somewhere in the world, woolie is getting hyped
[2:03:32] <+EvilSoully> Gameplay soon, dont worry!
[2:03:35] <+0ni0n_L0rd> So the plan was to commit Grand Genocide and create a new world that can kill the Elder Evil?
[2:03:35] <%pectusumbra> and then everyone got gassed
[2:03:36] <Polengoldur> so guys...what if valaris is right?
[2:03:37] <%Jon64s> Long live the race war
[2:03:37] <+SWFanatic> buttfuck the assbags
[2:03:38] <fiercefiresoul> The Garleans are just the Al Bhed if the Al Bhed believed they were the one true way of life.
[2:03:38] <suikudo> the dragons
[2:03:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> So it's two sides with ultimately the same goal, just two REALLY different ways of obtaining it?
[2:03:43] <+chronopaladin> everybody dragoons now
[2:03:45] <+shirimegane> What big names from previous FFs do we even have left to summon that might have an impact?
[2:03:46] <%GingaNZ> apatDab Race war time apatDab
[2:03:47] <suikudo> Holy shit they would really help us
[2:03:47] <Gregorhasjoined> Dragons are sleeping, can't come
[2:03:48] <Coltor23> When New Vegas
[2:03:49] <%DetroitSentai> Gotta save dragons for the xpac
[2:03:49] <%Mornaka> Dragon go up
[2:03:51] <%ReallyRedRum> I feel like a race war emote wouldn't look great for people just joining the stream
[2:03:51] <%lewdskeletor13> @derekwst3 Night pal
[2:03:52] <deviljhojho94> Race WAR BOIS

[2:03:57] <ReiDuran> Varis taking the Griffith route.
[2:03:57] <Covil91> The eagles can just fly Frodo to Mordor!
[2:03:58] <+RC_S3kshun8> use gun
[2:04:00] <%Mornaka> Race go up
[2:04:01] <+Mexrage> dragons and dragoons would be a big hammer against the empire's strongest aspect, their airships
[2:04:05] <sodium_station> this chat lacks context as it is
[2:04:06] <%Mystuun> apatDab
[2:04:06] <+JEiddew> @CommanderSqueaks One is "we have a plan but it involves killing everyone" the other is "oh god there has to be another way right? right????"
[2:04:08] <%Gogogolem> I am just sitting here being sad because the Mmo i like is dead.
[2:04:10] <%easternstealth> Are they just gonna do the realm reborn thing again?
[2:04:11] <donkymagooterson> "jesus why did I put my face in that blender?"
[2:04:22] <+SpamKingRathalos> I'm not sure about this plan, some of these guys ain't even humans.
[2:04:24] <CarrotWhisky> As Estinien showed, you can easily "jump" and destroy a huge metal cannon.
[2:04:32] <ColRedyx> @shirimegane There are still a lot of game-specific summons that haven't shown up yet. 6 and 8 had a ton each.
[2:04:33] <blacksoap65> @AngriestPat Pat dogg why you look so upset
[2:04:34] <+chronopaladin> FFXIV: Musou
[2:04:35] <+JEiddew> where is estinien even
[2:04:36] <+DoktahDoktah> Its been like 1 hour since I stabbed somebody.
[2:04:42] <ColRedyx> @shirimegane They can also make new ones. They already have been.
[2:04:44] <+RC_S3kshun8> !uptime
[2:04:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 4m.
[2:04:46] <arcaderabbit48> Estinien has proven that the magitech is not nearly as scary as it looks
[2:04:51] <matouci> @AngriestPat But would your duty finder tank handle 1k dudes
[2:04:53] <CarrotWhisky> To be fair, last time a dragon fought against the Empire, it took like the Empire's giant airship to "kill" Midgardsormr?
[2:04:55] <AlasterAngelo> bbrrrrrothhherrrrrrrrrr
[2:05:02] <+JEiddew> Get ready for a great dungeon with FLACCIDITY
[2:05:03] <%GingaNZ> well I wonder whats about to happen
[2:05:06] <sodium_station> I do like that they acknowledge the PC as a good Murder Hobo
[2:05:10] <$Yakobro> @CarrotWhisky it's okay, he got better LUL
[2:05:10] <SaltyAzteca> DO IT FOR CYAN
[2:05:11] <%furiousfurioso> you kill summoned gods as a day job for fucks sake
[2:05:12] <%PROUD2beGINGER> NO
[2:05:16] <donkymagooterson> *nod
[2:05:17] <+UKOrigin> the agrias
[2:05:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RC_S3kshun8) (warning)
[2:05:21] <+JEiddew> @CarrotWhisky he was like a superdragon though
[2:05:24] <Finaldragoon> reminder that Raubahn can still kick serious ass and he's missing an arm
[2:05:26] <BourneWarrior> NOD
[2:05:29] <%afronooch> Agrias oaks?
[2:05:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I just want a duty to be like dynasty warrior style, frontline pvp scale kind of battle where we fight tons of enemies
[2:05:31] <ScreamingMeat> 2 hours of talking
[2:05:31] <Fisk_Black_PSN> When does Cid show up in this game?
[2:05:37] <%nitronLVIII> warrior of light is basically a walking WMD
[2:05:43] <ReiDuran> Let Raubahn fight!!!
[2:05:43] <+EvilSoully> Cid shows up for the raids
[2:05:43] <%bbHighvalor> YUGIRI sipsipGasm
[2:05:46] <%lewdskeletor13> When does Goofy show up?
[2:05:46] <Endocrom> He's wearing a skirt
[2:05:47] <%PomegranateKing> Poke em in the bum hole
[2:05:50] <+Mexrage> somebody make a magitek arm for raubahn so he can fight again
[2:05:50] <Gregorhasjoined> Rauhban is the PC the story just couldn't allow.
[2:05:52] <@JustinianKnight> Cid is in sidequests now
[2:05:53] <Angry_Ev1L> @Fisk_Black_PSN very early
[2:05:53] <+EvilSoully> He runs the steampunk engineers
[2:05:54] <+JEiddew> @Fisk_Black_PSN past few patches he's been helping with raids
[2:05:55] <%sparrrow_> inb4 the Warrior of Light gets shot and dies immediatley
[2:05:56] <KoyaMusa> WHICH zenos
[2:05:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Which one?
[2:05:56] <$Yakobro> @Fisk_Black_PSN all the time, he's a huge science nerd, he's especially involved in the raids
[2:05:57] <%TheSpiritof2277> Where's Nero :c
[2:06:01] <%g0dhand9876> Arms
[2:06:01] <CarrotWhisky> @Fisk_Black_PSN Cid takes a back seat in Stormblood and is involved in the Omega-raid as well as cameos in the Ivalice-raid.
[2:06:03] <%GingaNZ> the race war starts now
[2:06:04] <@JustinianKnight> but he is important in the base story
[2:06:04] <%narusao> \o
[2:06:05] <%Thatghostpepper> @Fisk_Black_PSN he shows up every now and then
[2:06:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Real Zenos or Elidibus!Zenos?
[2:06:07] <suikudo> FOR EORZEa!!!!
[2:06:08] <ReiDuran> I still think that the crystal is evil.

[2:06:13] <dekkitout> Poooound
[2:06:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> aint it canon that your adventurer friends (other players) are just as godly as you are? Like they go "yo call up your other friends cause we're too weak"
[2:06:15] <Polengoldur> was that just a fucking Zelda shield?
[2:06:17] <ScreamingMeat> HAIL THE ROCK
[2:06:18] <%KaironFortressKnight> What an army. 20-25 guys
[2:06:20] <%sparrrow_> o/
[2:06:21] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> He doesn't show up here
[2:06:22] <Huntercd> Where are the cat people?
[2:06:28] <+Mexrage> Ele-Zenos @AngriestPat
[2:06:29] <Dieworc> This story is hard to follow sometimes
[2:06:30] <mr_hunter> elezenos
[2:06:31] <+JEiddew> @HeadsHeldHigh I think that's kind of unclear
[2:06:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> Please look forward to it
[2:06:37] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck off, kid
[2:06:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> He's taking a nap rn
[2:06:40] <$Yakobro> @HeadsHeldHigh yeah you're just about avg power as an adventurer, canonically I think you're special because of the echo
[2:06:43] <arcaderabbit48> @HeadsHeldHigh Its really weird, but the like 3 times your other WoLs are references, yes.
[2:06:44] <ColRedyx> Well, WoL is less of a WMD and more like Kaim from Lost Odyssey. He's just one soldier but an unstoppable one.
[2:06:46] <Covil91> @headsheldhigh other players are just shmucks with the echo
[2:06:49] <+EvilSoully> Reminder that Alisaie is only 17
[2:06:51] <+BioHunter> get rdy for a cool dungeon
[2:06:51] <Gregorhasjoined> Big war, no big deal
[2:06:52] <+Akiraz84> Why does alie sound like she's a woman approaching her 40s
[2:06:52] <+sixcubit> i was expecting the plot to be MUCH more complicated then it actually appears to be
[2:06:55] <%oKentucky> lol is he named after that french liqueor Alizay or whatrever?
[2:06:57] <ReiDuran> why did you have to say that
[2:06:58] <%NovaKnightmare> KISS HER
[2:06:58] <+yetionayacht> wait what happened to pat being a beautiful roegadyn?
[2:06:59] <CarrotWhisky> @HeadsHeldHigh Your companions are non-canon. It is assumed that every trial is you versus the boss. The game even jokes with it where Lyse suggests that your friends happens to be in Othard on a fishing trip when fighting Susano.
[2:07:01] <+EvilSoully> And she's killed like thousands of people at this point
[2:07:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What lead you to believe that the real Zenos' soul is still alive somewhere?
[2:07:03] <+tigerfang86> MAKE OUT
[2:07:04] <%JoeJotaro> feeling apatSmug

[2:10:36] <+shirimegane> Oh hey this piano is pretty damn good
[2:10:41] <speximillian> New Call of Duty looks good

[2:10:45] <sodium_station> Get the Trench Gun attachment for your katana
[2:10:47] <SchroedingersFerret> Those better not be machina brudda.
[2:10:49] <FoulNightingale> Oh, I didn't miss it. Sup Pat?
[2:10:49] <%CubicPhantom> you're generally not supposed to paratrooper into the enemy trenches piecemeal like that
[2:10:54] <CarrotWhisky> Everyone. Except for Limsa Lominsa forces.
[2:10:58] <suikudo> this is really cool
[2:11:03] <+UKOrigin> you better believe they're MAGITEK brudda
[2:11:06] <ReiDuran> Man Hien and Yugiri are so fuckin cool
[2:11:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What katana is Pat using?
[2:11:08] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> I didn’t know FFXIV took place in Boomer territory.
[2:11:08] <+EvilSoully> Limsa is here too
[2:11:09] <sodium_station> This dungeon has like three different aesthetics going on at once
[2:11:10] <LeeOhX> just over the ridge you can see Prompto escaping some imperials
[2:11:12] <+UKOrigin> *laughsinkefka*
[2:11:13] <Fordrilin> Bloody Pirates!
[2:11:14] <%edgeyberzerker> Gotta admit this is the push I need for ffxiv
[2:11:19] <TyrantBelial> Filthy Eorzeans ey brudda?
[2:11:23] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @Reizie_Etherealm looks like Suzaku
[2:11:24] <CarrotWhisky> @Reizie_Etherealm Suzaku's Katana
[2:11:26] <Reddhero12> @edgeyberzerker what do you mean
[2:11:28] <aeonicvector> "Im just saying, maybe the empite had a point ey brudda"
[2:11:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Thanks!

[2:11:54] <%sparrrow_> dig those trenches boii
[2:11:55] <+HeyBoston> don't mind this treasure coffer on an open battlefield
[2:11:56] <a_mad_dragon> is this call of duty?
[2:11:57] <SaltyAzteca> It aint me, it aint meeeee
[2:11:57] <+ZeekZaku> yehevohn
[2:11:57] <Gregorhasjoined> @TyrantBelial I'm jus sayin bruddah, dem ascians know whats best nah? MAHGEETEK
[2:11:58] <%Disname23> the hypest race war
[2:12:00] <sodium_station> straight up world war 2 style trenches was not something i was expecting
[2:12:00] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm guessing extreme too, I ain't having none of that
[2:12:04] <suikudo> those are fucking trenches
[2:12:09] <%GingaNZ> @edgeyberzerker stormblood is great, get the story skip so that you skip a relem reborn if you wanna save a lot of time
[2:12:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @HeyBoston It was on an airship that got shot down, shut up.
[2:12:11] <powerprotoman> i cant believe pat started a race war
[2:12:14] <$Yakobro> help this sch is triggering me
[2:12:15] <%edgeyberzerker> @Reddhero12 I've been won over to be honest. I also like the story elements in it :D
[2:12:17] <SaltyAzteca> THIS IS NAM BABY
[2:12:17] <%Fidel_Castbro> I love the theme for Ghimlyt Dark
[2:12:19] <%spacekataz18> Pupper snuffed
[2:12:20] <ColRedyx> It's almost like Pat is streaming this on the day a few hours of new story content dropped instead of the months of regular MMO gameplay in between.
[2:12:26] <%korth367> why they doing baby pulls
[2:12:31] <%Fidel_Castbro> just being a remix to the Stormblood battle theme
[2:12:43] <%Big_Dream> is pat in guild
[2:12:54] <+TheRealZubaz> no choice but to do baby pulls at the start of this dungeon
[2:12:56] <CarrotWhisky> @Big_Dream He is.
[2:12:57] <donkymagooterson> it's fine....
[2:12:58] <suikudo> PAT ABOUT TO FUCKING jinx IT ALL
[2:12:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Cause it's supposed to be a brand new experience not a speed run experience
[2:13:02] <+DoktahDoktah> Where is the part where Varis just gases his own troops?
[2:13:09] <Gregorhasjoined> There are literal piles of bodies in the corner, its goin OK
[2:13:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DoktahDoktah Give it 10 minutes.
[2:13:14] <fang_way> crazy talk activate
[2:13:17] <+shirimegane> God damn that ninja frog thing is goofy
[2:13:18] <%Big_Dream> quick press butoons do things
[2:13:19] <TranquilTurnip> Can Crazy Talk change the course of an MMO
[2:13:20] <mr_slaide> Look at all those dead mooks.
[2:13:27] <gustavozxd> @edgeyberzerker if you don't like to play with other people though, don't even bother, i wanted to like this game but as soon as i had to form a party to enter a dungeon i fucked off instantly
[2:13:41] <Polengoldur> something about playing an MMO with a controller makes my heart hurt
[2:13:41] <ReiDuran> Apparently they're adding NPCs for dungeons.
[2:13:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> An mmo requiring multiplayer, fawah?
[2:13:45] <+DoktahDoktah> @Gregorhasjoined But whose bodies are they?
[2:13:46] <+shirimegane> @gustavozxd What did you honestly expect paying for an MMO subsciption
[2:13:49] <%thegrimreaper76> Is Pat dps or tank?
[2:13:51] <thelonechris> Look at that big dude
[2:13:53] <+EvilSoully> dps
[2:13:56] <%kamen_advent> Iron Golem?
[2:13:56] <omegagoldenflame> what's class is he playing I just started playing FF14
[2:13:56] <%nitronLVIII> Hey look a Dark Souls boss
[2:13:59] <$Niney_Who> Where's Tarkus
[2:13:59] <%edgeyberzerker> @gustavozxd I do have friends and their party that were trying to get me to play it so at least I know I won't be soloing it
[2:14:00] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd you can solo stuff, you know
[2:14:01] <ScreamingMeat> The Absolute Unit
[2:14:01] <+EvilSoully> Samurai
[2:14:02] <+UKOrigin> gotta have a shiny giant, or it aint garlemald x'D
[2:14:02] <%Disname23> Doing rotations with a controller in a MMO sounds like a nightmare tbh
[2:14:04] <dekkitout> leave em to me, bruddah
[2:14:06] <ColRedyx> @edgeyberzerker Ignore him. Even if you want to play alone, you can just pretend the other people are NPCs. The dungeons aren't hard at all, and it's still a worthwhile experience.
[2:14:08] <%sparrrow_> IT'S CHUNGUS
[2:14:08] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd you know you can solo stuff, right?
[2:14:10] <%claudesavegely> big ol robot
[2:14:11] <arcaderabbit48> Ive had far more positive experiences with other players than negative ones, persopnally
[2:14:13] <Gregorhasjoined> BIG CHUNGUS
[2:14:14] <sodium_station> Giant fantasy boss in trenches. Man this is weird
[2:14:18] <CarrotWhisky> @omegagoldenflame Samurai. Unlocked at lvl 50 and beating the main story of 2.0

[2:14:21] <+TheRealZubaz> the control scheme for pad aint bad
[2:14:21] <KahunaTuna> Who is this SAM you are talking about? is he play with PAT?
[2:14:23] <gustavozxd> @shirimegane well everyone talked about how the game was great and i had to give it a chance, but i just couldn't do it
[2:14:25] <Tiewolf> sbfpUno
[2:14:31] <+HeyBoston> WHAT ARE MECHANICS
[2:14:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sodium_station To be fair, these are the most open as fuck trenches I've ever seen.
[2:14:35] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> SPIN 2 WIN
[2:14:37] <%nitronLVIII> NANI THE F

[2:14:55] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd you can solo most stuff by overleveling actually, 90% of the game
[2:14:56] <%joeobo2> I hope they keep that move
[2:14:57] <%lewdskeletor13> Ok that’s pretty nest

[2:16:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Fordrilin He did straight up call the potato girl a savage.
[2:16:27] <%crimsonharvest> look at all that SUCC
[2:16:27] <suikudo> 1 2 3 4 he declared a race war 5 6 7 8 he just wants to spread hate!

[2:16:41] <Polengoldur> i realize this is an mmo for console, but it seems really simple mechanically
[2:16:42] <%Nobrev> yeah he said he wanted to reunite all races into one like at the beginning so I dunno if he wants to kill everyone but garleans or if he wants to do some wacky dimension magic to just combine everyone from all the worlds
[2:16:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I can't wait to see Pat's reaction to the final boss of this dungeon
[2:16:46] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd this game is nothing like a moba. People on this game are incredibly nice. I've never had a bad experience.
[2:16:47] <shockmaster3> whats pats class in this
[2:16:47] <$KnivesEve> pat endorses the race war for the time cube
[2:16:51] <%Disname23> Maybe the Empire has a point brudda

[2:16:56] <%spacekataz18> Pat is a samurai currently
[2:17:01] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd playing league I get mean assholes every other game, but on FF14 I've NEVER had someone be mean
[2:17:03] <+vdalson> @Polengoldur this is also a dungeon, which tends to be simpler than raids or trials
[2:17:04] <$Yakobro> @ebonifragaria it's a dungeon, the ultimate fights are... more crazy :p
[2:17:05] <%gespenst25> blitzbol
[2:17:08] <shockmaster3> thanks
[2:17:14] <Armadageddon> The tank is bad
[2:17:18] <+Akiraz84> I wonder if he's gonna do the new 24 man tonight
[2:17:22] <ScreamingMeat> Blitzkrieg
[2:17:25] <arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd I have had significantly more positive experiences with people in this game, than negatives. So I would really encourage you to give it another try
[2:17:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shit just falling out of the sky. "This isn't going pretty okay." -Pat
[2:17:27] <ColRedyx> @gustavozxd One's a game you're supposed to fail where teammates are encouraged to betray each other, and the other is a PvP game.
[2:17:28] <Reddhero12> @Polengoldur this is literally the easiest content in the game
[2:17:33] <prime_name> Are Dragoons fun to play in this game?
[2:17:36] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria this is the easiest content in the game
[2:17:36] <CarrotWhisky> @Reddhero12 Most assholes in FFXIV usually appears during 1st week of a raid release.
[2:17:37] <Fordrilin> Oh look a Pug
[2:17:43] <KoyaMusa> did you fight seiryu?
[2:17:48] <PowerWeightedCell> theyre one of the most fun melee dps @prime_name
[2:17:51] <Caivyre> DO SEIRYU, COWARD
[2:17:52] <SailingSaturn> I really like this dunegon
[2:17:53] <Sitinomi> Got lucky that my run of the new 24 man had someone help explain mechanics
[2:17:55] <%Faustgesicht> nice

[2:18:01] <speximillian> @prime_name Do you like tanking the floor?
[2:18:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You're switching game instead of calling it a night?!
[2:18:04] <%lewdskeletor13> NEW VEGAS PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:18:08] <ebonifragaria> @Yakobro I mean it's so easy to see, not that there's lots of mechanics lol
[2:18:08] <gwbtoast> To New Vegas with the big Elmo by your hip.
[2:18:08] <%sparrrow_> @AngriestPat would you ever consider playing SWTOR? The story is basically KOTOR3
[2:18:09] <%st4rrytea> !uptime
[2:18:09] <+aivalera> Are you done with yakuzies?
[2:18:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 18m.
[2:18:09] <arcaderabbit48> @prime_name They have some awkward phases when they're leveling and getting all of their tools, but overall yes. I greatly enjoy Dragoon
[2:18:10] <thelonechris> Big Chungus Iron
[2:18:12] <Armadageddon> Seeing him never leave defiance makes me hurt as a war main
[2:18:13] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria go look up Bahamut Ultimate to see the hardest fight in the game
[2:18:13] <+Mexrage> what do you thought of the 24 man storyline and bosses? @AngriestPat
[2:18:14] <%Rngiddion> well FF is know for it
[2:18:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dekkitout Naw, it just has a gender war.
[2:18:15] <CarrotWhisky> @prime_name I would say so. They're quite popular melee jobs wise.
[2:18:16] <%amister3000> BIG RACE WAR
[2:18:16] <ScreamingMeat> Wakka loves it
[2:18:16] <%Remery_> I expect no less from this seris :/
[2:18:19] <ebonifragaria> like literal lines on the ground and shit
[2:18:24] <+BaronEgo> Did you do Seiryu and his EX though?
[2:18:25] <prime_name> @speximillian like, the floor itself
[2:18:27] <TranquilTurnip> Honest Hearts in NV is definitely a Race War
[2:18:28] <dekkitout> ill settle for a drug war
[2:18:28] <%NWR_James> Mr Snipsnip for FFXIV
[2:18:31] <RossMirage> You can run it on stream in a few weeks when people actually learn the raid.
[2:18:32] <applesonthemoon> ff1488
[2:18:32] <Reddhero12> @Polengoldur go look up bahamut ultimate to see the hardest fight in the game
[2:18:32] <%pectusumbra> So question: Is there any crystal chronicles stuff in this game?
[2:18:33] <ColRedyx> @Reddhero12 There are absolutely mean people in 14, the difference is you can still be successful in pugs.
[2:18:34] <KangarooCyborg> Let's get #RaceWar trending on @AngriestPat
[2:18:38] <SplodeyJesus> Great job ohnYes
[2:18:40] <Mastigias> Did he already do the 24 man raid?
[2:18:42] <%dingusGM> I prefer Fast and Furious Race Wars tbqh
[2:18:44] <speximillian> Dragoons always floortank
[2:18:44] <arcaderabbit48> @pectusumbra Not yet, to my knowledge
[2:18:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hasn't every final fantasy game been something of a big ol' race war?
[2:18:47] <%gnarly_memes_bro> i really like swtor but saying the story is kotor3 is a huuuuge stretch
[2:18:47] <%crimsonharvest> FIGHTPUP
[2:18:47] <+Cyclonicrage> It’s a niche thing

[2:18:53] <%pectusumbra> @Mastigias last night.
[2:18:54] <$Yakobro> @ebonifragaria yeah, there's a good amount of them without ground markers in different fights too, stuff can get nuts with markers in some fights also :D
[2:18:56] <%Kahnicus> @angriestpat Got me to play NV again you ginger bitch, god damn Nightstalkers in Old World Blues soaking up all my splodey ammo.
[2:18:57] <ReiDuran> What's the 24 man?

[2:19:02] <%pectusumbra> @arcaderabbit48 Noted and thanks.
[2:19:04] <TranquilTurnip> Honest Hearts is Race War the DLC
[2:19:07] <gustavozxd> @colredyx payday 2 you HAVE to work as team actually, problem is, long time players are absolute scumbags to the point where they'll have mods that auto ban you if you don't have a specific amount of hours in the game
[2:19:12] <razrPAIN> Big Al-Bhed Chungus
[2:19:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> @Mastigias Not on stream though
[2:19:18] <%skizzuto> who knew the race war would have so many flashing lights
[2:19:23] <%sparrrow_> @gnarly_memes_bro the Jedi Knight story is essentially Kotor3

[2:20:46] <%FrostMass22> Race war the potatos

[2:20:49] <%TheSpiritof2277> ALL THE WARRIORS
[2:20:50] <%claudesavegely> the fuck that's the first boss from ff7
[2:20:50] <%faegbeard> i'm amused that both MMOs Pat plays have Potatos in them
[2:20:51] <%Ahack13> Dude this is fucked.
[2:20:51] <$NocturneNovember> Aw shit, Guard Scorpion
[2:20:54] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> that is LITERALLY the first FF7 boss
[2:20:55] <%Agami23> this is just that one scene from KH2
[2:20:58] <%Cainhurstcrow> This feels like that Scene in Infinity War where Thor showed up and they started winning, before it all went wrong.
[2:20:59] <%ahalfeatenchocolateorange> "he's one of the only good ones of his people." - Pat, on the 'good' side of a race war.
[2:20:59] <Plague_bagel> strike when it tail is up
[2:21:00] <%Faustgesicht> Everyone's here!!
[2:21:01] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd that literally never happens in ff14
[2:21:03] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat Alliance set is great, and it dyes too!
[2:21:05] <speximillian> Watch out, that's not just a reactor!
[2:21:06] <%Ahack13> This is more of a war THAN THE ENTIRE WAR OF STORMBLOOD.
[2:21:06] <shurtal> fukkin Guard Scorpion, really?
[2:21:07] <+ZeekZaku> Varis aesthetics
[2:21:07] <arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd That sounds horrible and Im sorry you've had to deal with that in the past, but I promise you there is none of that in 14.
[2:21:08] <TranquilTurnip> That thing looks like the first boss from FF7
[2:21:09] <dekkitout> so its a party battlefield?
[2:21:10] <+xerj> FF7 scorpion!
[2:21:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, gas in 30...29....28...27...
[2:21:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> SWTOR is like the side story to a theoretical KOTOR 3
[2:21:17] <%aishman> This is str-OH FUCK THE GAS
[2:21:20] <%Micome> play Triple Triad you coward
[2:21:21] <CarrotWhisky> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll That boss also appears as an actual boss in the Ala Mhigo-dungeon of FFXIV.
[2:21:23] <Reddhero12> @TranquilTurnip it is
[2:21:25] <fang_way> when are they gonna world of warcraft this shit and dump the fart gas
[2:21:26] <%FrostMass22> "He's one of the good ones" -Pat "Race War Now" Boivin
[2:21:31] <TranquilTurnip> @Reddhero12 oh thats awesome
[2:21:32] <%aishman> @CommanderSqueaks I was about to say "Oh man, this is straight out of WW1."
[2:21:33] <Polengoldur> pro tip: don't go all day without food and then have 3+ margarita's. it may sound weak, but on an empty stomache it hits you like a truck
[2:21:39] <+Mexrage> you can also dye them
[2:21:41] <%claudesavegely> hey it's that boss from FF6
[2:21:42] <%bonzosan> This looks like VR Chat 2
[2:21:43] <%sparrrow_> It's Kotor in the sense that it has a cinematic storyline that concludes Revan's tale
[2:21:44] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> DIG BOI
[2:21:47] <HeadsHeldHigh> balls
[2:21:48] <AlasterAngelo> did he just strip to his underwear in the middle of a race war
[2:21:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Prometheus

[2:22:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> This battle is playing out like a Warhammer match.
[2:22:47] <%Jpdodds> something something dont stand in the fire

[2:22:53] <FrenchTact1cs> RepresentRabanasty
[2:22:57] <suikudo> Quick pat! Kill it before it says the N word!
[2:22:57] <gustavozxd> hmm I'm definetly interested in giving this game a try someday, I've just had too many bad experiences with interacting with people online so honestly whenever the possibility even comes up I start to lose interest LUL
[2:23:00] <razrPAIN> I dunno brudda, that looks like machina to me
[2:23:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sometimes I feel bad for not ever getting into FFXI or IV. This is not one of those times.
[2:23:10] <%Remery_> @voltage996 apatSmug
[2:23:12] <dekkitout> when this war to end all wars is over, the al-bhed are gonna pay, bruddah!
[2:23:14] <%faegbeard> al bhed more like all dead
[2:23:15] <+shirimegane> @gustavozxd Just make some friends like jesus
[2:23:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @razrPAIN It literally is, it's magitek
[2:23:20] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd ive NEVER had a bad experience on this game, I'm telling you
[2:23:25] <raimsurion> Then just dont play MMOs
[2:23:25] <PirahnaPlantZaibatsu> Is this game a monthly subscription, and if so, how much?
[2:23:26] <%valriot> Why is that Warrior in Defiance
[2:23:29] <Polengoldur> i've never seen the point behind subscribing to an mmo when there are so many good free ones
[2:23:29] <+Cyclonicrage> That need to be a mount !
[2:23:31] <deviljhojho94> ALL RACES should unite against the true enemy! THE AL BHED
[2:23:36] <deviljhojho94> BURN THE AL BHED
[2:23:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Wasted Kaiten!

[2:23:46] <+HeyBoston> suddenly BABLAOW
[2:23:50] <PirahnaPlantZaibatsu> ty
[2:23:52] <%gnarly_memes_bro> SUCCOR
[2:23:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> What's the Navi looking motherfucker that's floating around?
[2:23:54] <mylesmoore> boss hert bad defiance on pls
[2:23:58] <CarrotWhisky> @PirahnaPlantZaibatsu I thin it's standard 12 USD per month? Cheaper if you do 6-month subscription.
[2:23:58] <%easternstealth> succ
[2:23:58] <%Voidwyvern> 13 USD if you don't mind having one character
[2:23:58] <+UKOrigin> the game is free up to level 30
[2:23:58] <suikudo> This game has alot of elitism
[2:24:01] <ebonifragaria> Oh no, I want to MMO heal again. Oh no.
[2:24:04] <%gnarly_memes_bro> what a name for an ability
[2:24:05] <gustavozxd> @shirimegane none of my friends play videogames or even have the time to play, and the one friend that does play just plays overwatch, LoL or fortnite all day
[2:24:05] <fiercefiresoul> Pat, SAMs don't have side positionals. Just attack from behind.
[2:24:07] <ColRedyx> Nah, you'll have some bad experiences, it's just worth it.
[2:24:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> So this is what having a good internet connection looks like
[2:24:15] <$2Metronomes> Healing fairy
[2:24:15] <PowerWeightedCell> @CommanderSqueaks its the scholar's pet, does healig
[2:24:16] <+UKOrigin> this game has barely any elitism compared to league and wow..
[2:24:20] <%kamen_advent> Pat that was an FF6 boss
[2:24:20] <Gregorhasjoined> Worth.
[2:24:20] <thelonechris> Fuck you stupid car
[2:24:21] <CarrotWhisky> @fiercefiresoul SAM does have 1x Side positional attack.
[2:24:21] <Reddhero12> @gustavozxd you can make friends IN ff14
[2:24:22] <donkymagooterson> Praise be to Yevon!
[2:24:23] <+miguelrod777> if you but the game for the first time you get a month free
[2:24:23] <%spacekataz18> YE
[2:24:24] <ColRedyx> You can't get this kind of gameplay without other players.
[2:24:25] <%Nobrev> apatBig apatBig apatBig
[2:24:28] <suikudo> Doesnt matter how much it has
[2:24:29] <PowerWeightedCell> impact crater? metroid prime inc?
[2:24:31] <matouci> @CommanderSqueaks Scholars have fairy pets that heal poeple for them
[2:24:31] <%Ahack13> Really interested to see the final boss of this place.
[2:24:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Metal Gear Weeabo - DEFEAT
[2:24:32] <%rhapsodyinrose> I need to play more sch
[2:24:32] <suikudo> it has elitism
[2:24:41] <%Skrypto> Are you the REAL Bosch Fon Ronsenburg of Dalmasca? cheer200
[2:24:41] <fang_way> YO AYMERIC
[2:24:42] <HeadsHeldHigh> Elfy boi
[2:24:42] <TranquilTurnip> I hope that Seymour just shows up
[2:24:43] <CarrotWhisky> Go Aymric, Go!
[2:24:54] <%Voidwyvern> @gustavozxd you could give it a go for no moneys. the free trial let's you play to level 35
[2:24:54] <Plague_bagel> what game doesnt have elitism
[2:24:54] <+EvilSoully> Kan-E legitimately kicks ass in this dungeon
[2:24:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Zaver88) (warning)
[2:24:57] <%Ahack13> @suikudo FF14 eliteism is nothing compaired to WoW
[2:24:59] <%topendbuzz> pat has a bone for an alf
[2:25:00] <Gregorhasjoined> Aymeric and Kan-E-Senna on the front lines, why are these leaders just kickin ass?!?
[2:25:00] <arcaderabbit48> There's definitely some elitism in this game, but its really easy to ignore for that most part. Its not like other communities where people are super in your face with it
[2:25:01] <+Cyclonicrage> Twin sisters
[2:25:03] <ebonifragaria> I hate how healers in FFXIV are expected to dps, too.
[2:25:05] <%topendbuzz> elf*
[2:25:05] <Basch71> it really is LuL
[2:25:08] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Did you say no homo?
[2:25:12] <LeeOhX> This is just like Kingdom hearts when hollow bastion gets invaded, this is rad
[2:25:13] <arcaderabbit48> Aymeric is your rebound boyfriend, after your first boyfriend dies
[2:25:14] <+UKOrigin> and your character has ptsd about getting poisoned the whole time, its great lol
[2:25:15] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria why? it makes them more than healbots LUL
[2:25:15] <suikudo> @Ahack13 Doesnt matter how much it has
[2:25:17] <%BlackJack607> @Reizie_Etherealm ALL THE HOMO
[2:25:17] <applesonthemoon> watch yourselves around elves friend
[2:25:19] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria tanks need to DPS too
[2:25:21] <%TheSpiritof2277> Canon replacement elf boyfriend
[2:25:22] <%GarbageNirvana> apatBig fuck eyes
[2:25:24] <%SimplesRock> so they can die
[2:25:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Ahack13 It's been almost 10 years, but WoW PvP back when I played was the most toxic bullshit.
[2:25:27] <+shirimegane> So they can die dramatically!
[2:25:27] <HeadsHeldHigh> shutup doe
[2:25:27] <+HeyBoston> because he's only got one arm pat
[2:25:27] <%rhapsodyinrose> I actually really like dpsing as a healer
[2:25:27] <+UKOrigin> raubahns the commander
[2:25:28] <ebonifragaria> @Reddhero12 I like being a healbot >:(
[2:25:28] <suikudo> Raughbahn has one arm
[2:25:29] <%Voidwyvern> I guess they got strong armed into fighting
[2:25:30] <$Yakobro> @ebonifragaria it's the best, always let everyone get to 10% :P
[2:25:31] <CarrotWhisky> Raubahn is a field commander with strategy and such
[2:25:32] <haisho> title field commander, has to be in the back
[2:25:32] <Mastigias> They have both their arms
[2:25:33] <ReiDuran> So Raubahn can watch everyone die
[2:25:33] <%GingaNZ> hes the commander
[2:25:34] <speximillian> I hate how healers expect not to do DPS cuz of other games
[2:25:34] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria gotta do work fam
[2:25:35] <%valriot> @suikudo Yeah but the playerbase is so bad that everything is considered elitism
[2:25:35] <Gregorhasjoined> Arbitrary death flag
[2:25:35] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Cause he only has one arm.
[2:25:36] <%crimsonharvest> Because Rauban is the commander of the armed forces, these guys dont run the miliatary
[2:25:37] <@Squishy3> raubahn is tactics
[2:25:38] <+psychocalibur> animations!
[2:25:39] <%Nobrev> cuz he only got one gotdam arm
[2:25:40] <dekkitout> its normandy, bois
[2:25:43] <%JollyHeracross> they didnt want to miss out on the RACE WAR
[2:25:45] <Covil91> Because Rahbahn is in charge of ALL the Alliance armies.
[2:25:50] <+UKOrigin> is this healer just sat afk lol
[2:25:52] <Finakala> Raubahn is a tactician, he needs to stay back when there's a solid military source
[2:25:55] <+Comrade_Vladof> Raubahn is a one-armed old man now, he can't fight
[2:25:56] <%ShiftyFish> If I were to get FFXIV is RDM worth playing?
[2:25:59] <Finakala> His commands are vital
[2:26:02] <fiercefiresoul> Because Raubahn's the commander for Ala Mhigan forces, and everyone else is there to back the Ala Mhigan forces. Thus, Raubahn's technically the one giving orders right now. Also, only one arm.
[2:26:02] <+Chud_Pudsley> Pat would play this class.
[2:26:03] <+EvilSoully> RDM is my fav class atm
[2:26:04] <%gespenst25> because rahubahn is doing big orders
[2:26:06] <%Voidwyvern> absolutley on RDM
[2:26:07] <+vdalson> @ShiftyFish i found rdm really fun
[2:26:09] <+Mexrage> @ShiftyFish yes
[2:26:10] <suikudo> @valriot thats kinda besides the point tho
[2:26:10] <Reddhero12> @ShiftyFish Red Mage is extremely good and fun
[2:26:10] <+EvilSoully> I switched to it from DRG
[2:26:13] <%Ahack13> @CommanderSqueaks It hasn't gotten any better. Let me tell ya. I went back for BFA. Not a good idea.
[2:26:14] <Caivyre> RDM BEST MAGE
[2:26:18] <ebonifragaria> @Reddhero12 Healing is work, or it should be
[2:26:19] <+shirimegane> @ShiftyFish Absolutely. The job is loads of fun, and quite effective.
[2:26:20] <speximillian> Like real talk scholars have a pet to heal, drop some Ruin spells
[2:26:20] <CarrotWhisky> To be fair though, Raubahn can fight good enough with only 1x arm. He thought in the Ishgard torunament back in Heavensward and during the siege of Ala Mhigo.
[2:26:21] <+Landsharks> one arm doesn't matter, Raubahn fought in the 4.0 MSQ lol
[2:26:21] <PowerWeightedCell> @ShiftyFish RDM is a very easy job to get into playing and its got good utility and a fancy hat
[2:26:24] <+EvilSoully> The NPCs doing mechanics
[2:26:26] <zandar12> AI doing mechanics Pog
[2:26:26] <arcaderabbit48> @ShiftyFish Yes, but its not a class you unlock until later in the game. Whic really sucks cause it'd be a great starter class
[2:26:26] <FrenchTact1cs> One arm does not slow Raub down
[2:26:27] <+Mexrage> very mobile caster dps, with lots of utility
[2:26:30] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria it is. but wanna know whats even more work? healing AND dps
[2:26:32] <+Cyclonicrage> Will Fortnite PvP coming to FF xiv lol testing air drops
[2:26:40] <+UKOrigin> healers should be dpsing an entire fight
[2:26:41] <%ShiftyFish> I'll have to think about it.
[2:26:46] <mr_slaide> DPS players are usually morons.
[2:26:46] <cheezbass> this music seems out of place
[2:26:49] <+HeyBoston> TANKS
[2:26:50] <thelonechris> Another car
[2:26:51] <%valriot> @suikudo Not really, Darius isnt even using Deliverance, aka Fell Cleave/Decimate, so why even bother playing that Job to begin with
[2:26:56] <Reddhero12> @Cyclonicrage you already fall from the sky in byakko lol
[2:27:00] <prime_name> Bosses after bosses!
[2:27:01] <raimsurion> Too many gated trash packs in this one.
[2:27:04] <the_mental_punk> Hello everyone!
[2:27:08] <ebonifragaria> @Reddhero12 I don't wanna dps waaaaah *cries in holy priest*
[2:27:10] <%Skrypto> Final Call of Modern Fantasy

[2:27:18] <+sergeantsuperbeast> heyo punk
[2:27:21] <%Skrypto> Warfare
[2:27:22] <suikudo> @valriot see that right there is the elitism he is getting the job done right? so it doesnt matter
[2:27:23] <ScreamingMeat> Did it even get to attack ONCE?
[2:27:26] <speximillian> Winston? What?
[2:27:27] <Reddhero12> @ebonifragaria the first conjurer quest literally has a girl whoc ries because she doesnt wanna dps and only wants to heal LUL
[2:27:29] <FrenchTact1cs> This a long ass dun
[2:27:30] <+HeyBoston> it's a war pat
[2:27:32] <%spacekataz18> Winston checks in
[2:27:34] <+UKOrigin> yeah sure
[2:27:36] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> MECHA GORILLA
[2:27:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's almost like SE can't think of new ones

[2:28:10] <the_mental_punk> Hey if i'm not into mmorpg's all that much, should I try investing time into ffxiv
[2:28:16] <ReiDuran> No
[2:28:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's a straight line of a rotation Kappa
[2:28:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat's working of an 8GB stick of mind memory.
[2:28:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> STRONK
[2:28:20] <FrenchTact1cs> No
[2:28:22] <HeadsHeldHigh> no

[2:28:23] <%topendbuzz> muh mind sapce
[2:28:23] <Reddhero12> @the_mental_punk it's a great FF game on its own, if you like FF stories it's a lot of fun
[2:28:23] <+anusholeboner> his mind-palace is full
[2:28:24] <ReiDuran> It's 100% an MMO
[2:28:24] <$Niney_Who> Darn
[2:28:26] <a_mad_dragon> mind palace fully occupied
[2:28:27] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @the_mental_punk probably not, no
[2:28:28] <+zaras00> Yeah no, 2.0 isn't great and it's a lot to catch up on
[2:28:29] <CarrotWhisky> @the_mental_punk Well it is a MMO at it's very core, and as a FFXIV fan, no.
[2:28:30] <+miguelrod777> heavy mmo
[2:28:31] <ColRedyx> @valriot I don't switch to Deliverance for trash. Defiance makes a big difference on big pulls. Better to let the healer use more GCDs on damage. For bosses though, yeah, get threat and switch immediately.
[2:28:32] <Reddhero12> @the_mental_punk the story is really good
[2:28:39] <%Fidel_Castbro> CRAZY TALK
[2:28:39] <SailingSaturn> @the_mental_punk theres a free trial where you play up to lvl 35

[2:28:50] <raimsurion> WAY TOO MUCH trash packs in this one
[2:28:51] <%Thatghostpepper> @the_mental_punk there is a free version of this game BUT you're capped at 35
[2:28:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> CT popped
[2:28:52] <suikudo> Big whoop
[2:28:54] <raimsurion> Like holy shit

[2:29:01] <%SaltyDongs> cunny
[2:29:03] <+EvilSoully> Kan-E is the most OP mage in the game
[2:29:06] <WiredKT> Why does every NPC conjurer get that shield but I don't? >:/

[2:29:43] <%Skrypto> apatWhat :O
[2:29:44] <%valriot> @colredyx Yeah, for sure, but depending on the trash, you can just delete the pile with Decimate spam. my point is, the idea that people ignore 40% of a Job is nonsense to me
[2:29:45] <Covil91> The NPC that LBs here is random
[2:29:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Oh, can ANYONE do that? Lyse did it in my run

[2:30:06] <SailingSaturn> Yeah Lyse did it in mine too cirThink
[2:30:08] <%Reizie_Etherealm> For me Yugiri was the one who LB'ed

[2:30:57] <%spacekataz18> Gunblade stance yay
[2:31:03] <ColRedyx> @valriot Sure, certain trash. There's the pull in the middle of Continuum Hard that I do that on, but usually better to play it safe than risk a wipe that would completely negate all the time you saved.
[2:31:10] <%faegbeard> borenstein and no
[2:31:11] <speximillian> WHEN'S MAHVEL?!
[2:31:13] <FrenchTact1cs> Goon would have ended the fight already
[2:31:14] <mr_hunter> look it's vergin and donte
[2:31:18] <%crimsonharvest> this is a mario party fight
[2:31:19] <CarrotWhisky> @PowerWeightedCell Agreed. Bit disappointing that the Stormblood boss theme didn't get a remix mid-patches.
[2:31:22] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> careful here!
[2:31:24] <%Disname23> prepare for trouble
[2:31:26] <%hermit_sensei> how well does ffxiv control on ps4 pad compared to kb? seems nice for relaxing while playing
[2:31:26] <Texeu> Oh cool its random which one fights first
[2:31:26] <+shirimegane> lmao "Annia quo Sore Anus"

[2:31:49] <Reddhero12> @hermit_sensei very well
[2:31:56] <flame_of_udun_> Holy shit the music
[2:32:02] <+psychocalibur> POWER GEYSER!
[2:32:03] <%valriot> @colredyx Yeah no i agree. but still, Darius hasnt used it the whole dungeon and its like...bordering on Black Mages who dont use Flare or Foul
[2:32:04] <PowerWeightedCell> mfw people think Nobuo is the only person that can compose FF music
[2:32:04] <+shirimegane> This track starts to get old when it plays for every Stormblood dungeon last boss.
[2:32:06] <PowerWeightedCell> Soken is GOD
[2:32:08] <speximillian> @hermit_sensei those crossbars at the bottom correspond to PS4 pad buttons
[2:32:09] <+Fenlig> Do you not need to coordinate with your team mates in this game?
[2:32:09] <suikudo> They re-use this song alot in stromblood
[2:32:12] <+Mexrage> I wonder if those 2 will end up being reference to Celia and Lettie from FFT
[2:32:15] <fiercefiresoul> Y'all ain't heard the Stormblood boss music?
[2:32:21] <Basch71> just the regular stormblood boss theme Kappa
[2:32:23] <flame_of_udun_> Nope I don’t play mmos
[2:32:27] <Thalchampz> well to be fair it's a pretty fucking good song
[2:32:27] <ColRedyx> @valriot Maybe he knows his healer is bad.
[2:32:29] <Reddhero12> @Fenlig in hard fights you definitely do, basically have to be in voice for hard fights
[2:32:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> The music is alright. I wouldn't say it's "HOLY SHIT" worthy.
[2:32:32] <%hermit_sensei> ty I think i'll try it out
[2:32:33] <%joeobo2> Time for ping pong!
[2:32:40] <CarrotWhisky> @PowerWeightedCell All praise Soken and his magical talent! He doesn't even have any formal music education.
[2:32:40] <ScreamingMeat> Ornstien and Smough
[2:32:41] <mylesmoore> revenge twofold is a way better boss theme
[2:32:42] <%Jpdodds> @shirimegane Its my first time hearing it cuz I hat mmos but this seems cuhrazy

[2:33:27] <CarrotWhisky> @Jpdodds Did you know that FFXIV have the Guiness World Record for most original songs in a video game? It is very varied with remixes from previous FF games as well as original soundtracks of very varied genres.
[2:33:28] <ColRedyx> This isn't even the hypest. Hopefully Pat does Seiryu on stream.

[2:40:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was shocked that there was no poison gas.
[2:40:28] <%BeardedLuchador> @irontarkus 🤔 depends on how much you can stomach. The early stuff is a little slow but it helps you get to know the characters and their motivations later
[2:40:30] <+RC_S3kshun8> I read that as Horny Boulder at first.
[2:40:33] <HeadsHeldHigh> My boy Hoary

[2:40:44] <CarrotWhisky> @irontarkus I would say the only part that is worth power through is the Titan-questline in 2.xx. Rest gives you an established lore but it isn't until 2.4 story line that it starts to pickup and 2.55 when it gets really great.
[2:40:44] <%lewdskeletor13> New Vegas time? PogChamp PogChamp

[2:41:29] <ColRedyx> I hate when people have to say "it doesn't get good until after 50" but the fact is everything from 1-50 is ALL from when the game originally relaunched, before they got any feedback on the new version, that's why it's rough for a while, but it's really a minority of the game at this stage, and once it picks up around halfway through the 50 story it stays good from then on.

[2:43:49] <ColRedyx> @irontarkus Well the nice thing is the games are all pretty much self-contained, so you don't have to catch up on past games except for the direct 10 and 13 sequels. You could just start 14 and understand what's going on as long as you read what's shown to you.
[2:43:57] <%Deft_Thought> This sounds like a chiptune version of Sunflower
[2:44:15] <Ugato> This is always just the best song to chill out to

[2:46:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> real chiptune sounds different than what people identify as chiptune now. Like Atari systems, for example, had a sound chip that turned math into bleeps and bloops for your background listening horror.
[2:46:20] <%GarbageNirvana> @saiduq25 afaik buying the expansion means you get everything before it as well
[2:46:24] <%lewdskeletor13> New Vegas is a gem. If you can get past the bugs

[2:47:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @TyrantBelial Ross doesn't even seem like he belongs in the same universe as the others
[2:47:55] <+SpamKingRathalos> This music is soothing
[2:47:58] <%lewdskeletor13> @saiduq25 Welcome! apatDab
[2:48:00] <TheRealSalmonDinner> Ross is the clear melvin of Friends
[2:48:03] <TyrantBelial> No I meant from friends!
[2:48:08] <%Jon64s> Is the race war over
[2:48:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Yuppie
[2:48:16] <%Jpdodds> Only just begun
[2:48:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ross in Friends is the worst.
[2:48:21] <SonicD4> @saiduq25 hi
[2:48:24] <CountNebula> The Race War never ends.
[2:48:24] <alrobot2014> @Jon64s the race war continues in a couple months
[2:48:25] <%mgs3ladderscene> apatDab
[2:48:26] <evilchicken713> @jon64s not as long as the time cube is bringing us down
[2:48:28] <%FrostMass22> Everyone in Friends,is,a melvin
[2:48:34] <TranquilTurnip> The race war is on pause
[2:48:39] <leinadtonu> there was arace war? damn I missed it...
[2:48:39] <kingdudeby> I don't like that episode where ross kills a guy
[2:48:42] <saiduq25> Watching Pat play New Vegas made me want to give it another try. Probably didn't play the game enough but i just couldnt get into it
[2:48:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Always Sunny has no bad characters
[2:48:43] <+SvenHolgersson> Hooray good game time
[2:48:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> we were ON a LAPSE
[2:48:56] <%FrostMass22> I didn't like that episode where Joey started a race war
[2:49:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Friends is Seinfield for people with no attention span. And Seinfield is bad enough.
[2:49:02] <TheRealSalmonDinner> Joey's no melvin, Joey fucks
[2:49:03] <kingdudeby> I remember that one
[2:49:16] <%Jon64s> Watching ff14 almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
[2:49:17] <%Jpdodds> What this about a racecar? I though the FF people rode birds
[2:49:19] <%umbypokochan> remember the one where Chandler had a knife fight with a hobo for crack money?
[2:49:20] <%lewdskeletor13> @frostmass22 That was the BEST one
[2:49:20] <breaker_jones> Remember that time Joey had a spinoff show?
[2:49:25] <%GoogleyGareth> I feel like I want to start streaming new vegas because 4 people I follow have decided to do so as well.
[2:49:26] <evilchicken713> My physics teacher from last year hates Friends so much man
[2:49:26] <saiduq25> watched maybe 3 episodes of seinfield and just couldnt get into it
[2:49:29] <%ThePuddingDead> Eyyyy

[2:50:31] <+Sp3ctre48> You know what is bad, Friends
[2:50:33] <CountNebula> All y'all talkin' 'bout Friends and Seinfeld like Frasier isn't the greatest show ever. Deez guys.
[2:50:33] <thelonechris> If you've never watched Seinfeld, you've never lived
[2:50:38] <%bloomingzonda> Just pee in your mouth it is more efficient
[2:50:40] <dekkitout> so i gave seinfeld a gander on the google machine- what happened today ResidentSleeper ?
[2:50:41] <%SaltyDongs> Mods?

[2:50:56] <TheRealSalmonDinner> Frasier's already a known quantity, it's not worth bringing up, everyone knows it's good

[2:51:02] <+Sp3ctre48> Always Sunny should be in it's own category
[2:51:07] <TheRealSalmonDinner> There's no Frasier discoure
[2:51:10] <fluffypupperino> dont free the hostages until you bring that redneck fuck along with you or your life is gonna get REAL difficult
[2:51:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Always Sunny is classic.

[2:51:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Always Sunny is the Seinfield formula taken to an extreme

[3:07:12] <JittersCaffeine> You did Booted without Boone, so you didn't get credit

[3:07:23] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You know you cant actually do them before you confront benny right?
[3:07:24] <%Ferakin> If you go back to the crucified town and give a guy in a house some drugs, that'll give you Boone points
[3:07:26] <%MellowDramaticSpider> Favorite people playing my favorite game demands some bits pogchamp500
[3:07:30] <%the_mental_punk> You can just go slaughter the entire legion right now and it will bump your relationship with boone
[3:07:32] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> It took me awhile to figure this out but "Pat" backwards is "Tap" :)
[3:07:42] <%Das_Bass> NCR run?
[3:07:43] <FrenchTact1cs> Is nuclear winter banned or something?
[3:07:47] <+Fantion> Wait what
[3:07:48] <ScreamingMeat> Go to Bitter Springs
[3:07:50] <Gruhunchously> Do the NCR quest with the the spy and make sure to kill him.
[3:07:52] <grimnier> kill the legion that they are interogating at camp mcarron
[3:07:53] <JittersCaffeine> Go do the interrigation in Camp McCarren
[3:07:55] <+SenorCounter> You have to go North east of NV to Bitter Springs
[3:08:07] <JittersCaffeine> you can get both points for doing it nonviolently and killing him afterwards
[3:08:08] <%lewdskeletor13> FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY
[3:08:08] <%Give_Me_Liberty> You planning to do the dlc as well?

[3:09:14] <%snow_bush> Catfondler!
[3:09:16] <mr_slaide> Shoot it.
[3:09:18] <%lewdskeletor13> SHOOT THAT MEMORIAL apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab

[3:09:25] <$Niney_Who> wait
[3:09:26] <PSI_Guy95> Why would you need a memorial for war, it's not like it ever changes
[3:09:28] <%TheSpiritof2277> what happens if you snipe it from a distance
[3:09:28] <%Wrashis> say the thing to the guy at the memorial
[3:09:29] <+BaronEgo> SHOOT THE MEMORIAL
[3:09:29] <%Faustgesicht> be careful with dragon age inquistion, pat. momentum fucking dies halfway through

[3:09:32] <Gruhunchously> Tarantula Hawks are terrifying
[3:09:33] <%cureneckbeard> !uptime
[3:09:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 9m.
[3:09:38] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat I would reccomend you go to cottonwood cove before you confront benny. If you want Gannon points it helps getting boone points from the cove
[3:09:39] <$Niney_Who> Boulder City more like Rubble City
[3:09:40] <$Niney_Who> Kappa
[3:09:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PSI_Guy95 Go to your room

[3:09:44] <%kreegmeyer> remember to punch the war memorial and disrespect the dead Kappa
[3:09:50] <Xel_Gel> Look at that loading area

[3:10:01] <+BaronEgo> The place where a guy is a little bitch and his brother was too
[3:10:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @the_mental_punk You think that's cheese you're eating?

[3:11:12] <donkymagooterson> someone please shave this man
[3:11:15] <Gruhunchously> Oh, it's Yuri Lowenthal, I didn't recognize him.
[3:11:16] <+SenorCounter> NCR doesn't build shit! 200 years and no one wants to actually build decent shelters
[3:11:16] <simbadg13> is this where yosuke came after the events of p4?
[3:11:16] <alrobot2014> Liam O'Brien is 50%
[3:11:19] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Do drugs, Pat.
[3:11:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Yuri and Liam are 95 percent of this game
[3:11:26] <alrobot2014> and Laura Bailey is the other 10%

[3:11:30] <RaidoKuzunohaXIV> so this game had a record for dialogue options
[3:11:32] <%Ferakin> Yuri Lowenthal plays the old-as-fuck Brotherhood elder and just uses his normal voice, which is weird
[3:11:34] <RaidoKuzunohaXIV> but only 3 VAs
[3:11:38] <%ahegotrigger> just buy some coke

[3:24:11] <drewslo> barter is my dump star
[3:24:13] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> unarmed. then remove your arms. become the unarmed bandit.
[3:24:14] <jacob97> Barter is really low
[3:24:15] <CountNebula> All these odd numbers for skills is triggering the fuck out of me.
[3:24:16] <%Aitch971> 80
[3:24:18] <Al3xanderdelag> ok i'll do this thing that'll totally get me in prison for a good while, thanks stranger!

[3:24:34] <+ogrest> Hey pat, medicine is for lames who get hit by things, instead, hack in infinite numbers of mini nukes and never go around a corner you suspect may have enemies behind it and check your corners with nuclear devastation
[3:24:36] <+InugamiTheHound> PC with mods
[3:24:39] <+mutavault666> melee
[3:24:40] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat is there a feature where u can evade shots point blanke if u max lick?
[3:24:42] <%Nobrev> I agree with speech

[3:24:46] <Luesagna00> *luck
[3:24:47] <%afronooch> Barter!!
[3:24:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can use Sneak to smuggle weapons into the Casino Benny hangs out in
[3:24:47] <Gruhunchously> Barter lets you get the Mysterious Stranger's gun.
[3:24:50] <%Skrypto> no barter is so low it wont matter

[3:25:15] <Them00n> 100 for dlc
[3:25:16] <JittersCaffeine> You'll need 100 for a peacful ending to Veronica's quest
[3:25:16] <fakemalegamer> 200
[3:25:17] <%lizard0tm> Some require 95
[3:25:18] <$birdfella> 10000000
[3:25:19] <%ahegotrigger> 75 for almost everything
[3:25:20] <RipSlamsteak> there are several 100 checks

[3:25:22] <$Niney_Who> 3 for Veronica

[3:25:26] <KeystoneA1> 75 if you don't want to talk Lanius down

[3:26:05] <llpanic> for perks and terminals
[3:26:07] <TyrantBelial> 90 is the safe zone for most checks including DLC

[4:26:24] <$SGrim> @Gruhunchously you want to get 26 value in 2 of the three lanes. Make a deck entirely out of 10's, 9's, and 7's to win easily.
[4:26:24] <%GarbageNirvana> PUT ON SKYNYRD

[4:26:26] <+Sp3ctre48> Elmo dont say the N word D:
[4:26:29] <SirDogBear> is 200 the max bet? pat should bet it all if possible PogChamp
[4:26:31] <$Piemono> Can Pat do math?
[4:26:31] <GoDZooKii> You'd think someone so into Min/Maxing would know math.
[4:26:32] <TalisKanju> @AngriestPat What's that shirt you're wearing Pat?
[4:26:32] <%dingusGM> Is this a cry for help from Elmo?
[4:26:32] <%RaikenTB> 5?
[4:26:33] <CrypticMochi> Elmo is typing a hate speech
[4:26:35] <KeystoneA1> It used to be you could get like 1 or 2 caps under the limit, then go play (save scum) the slot machine until you hit a jackpot on that, and you'd get literally 10's of thousands of caps. Pretty sure they fixed that, unfortunately.
[4:26:35] <mercado94> @AngriestPat just give Paige the controller during this part
[4:26:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Elmo is being racist again

[4:27:32] <ravencloak13> @logothx They tell you you to leave and never come back... if you do they try fill you full of lead.
[4:27:35] <%TheSpiritof2277> that's them basically saying "hey stop winning"
[4:27:36] <The_Blumper> is Pat about to be kicked out?
[4:27:38] <%CubicPhantom> enticing the winners to play till they lose doesn't work too well when they can alter the laws of probability and burn timelines to cheat
[4:27:39] <slothslayer828> i feel that was threating
[4:27:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Arcade Ganon is literally the coolest name of all time

[4:44:19] <a_waste_of_space_> it says GRA so probably
[4:44:19] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat unless you download the mod for it
[4:44:20] <DefectoRoboto> not in vanilla
[4:44:20] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat There are mods to let you mod the GRA guns
[4:44:21] <Archdz> it zooms more than a scope naturally

[4:45:00] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat put your armor on
[4:45:03] <bayowolfterra> Why does the aiming look awkward?
[4:45:05] <KeystoneA1> Where Veronica is
[4:45:09] <%ace_cfa44> did you shoot the memorial yet?
[4:45:10] <KeystoneA1> The 188 trading post
[4:45:11] <aeonicvector> if you use WMX you can mod uniques
[4:45:12] <Gruhunchously> The 188 Trading Post. Where Veronica is.
[4:45:15] <+aivalera> The highway
[4:45:17] <+Promessa_EX> because pat uses pad
[4:45:17] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat put your armor on
[4:45:18] <$Niney_Who> Where Veronica is
[4:45:21] <Qits> Yeah he shot the memorial already.
[4:45:21] <%SiameseSneeze> You CAN'T install mods on uniques
[4:45:25] <TalisKanju> The place where you meet Veronica
[4:45:27] <%crimsonharvest> the 188 is the camp where veronica is, the gun runners has a merchant there working for NCR remember? @AngriestPat
[4:45:32] <RiceeFTW> Paciencia already zooms like 3x
[4:45:32] <%king_wragles> Was Pat wandering the wastes... in lingerie?
[4:45:35] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> DID YOU DO VAULT 11 pat?
[4:45:35] <ScreamingMeat> Armor go up but Swag go down
[4:45:37] <bayowolfterra> Nevermind, actually looked at pat
[4:45:37] <RainMews> We got Boone?
[4:45:41] <+Tylermcd93> Shoot the memorial again
[4:45:45] <$Niney_Who> Also I'm pretty sure it's the I-88 not One-88
[4:45:45] <WackyXmand> Its Boone's that envolves the old lady here right?
[4:45:49] <Gruhunchously> You can get there easily from Boulder City.
[4:45:53] <TalisKanju> What's the vault with the plant people?
[4:45:58] <dekkitout> weapon mods extended is the mod you want if you wanna -mildly- break the game
[4:46:00] <Archmortal> Parencia's zoom is apparently equivalent to the best scopes anyway
[4:46:01] <alrobot2014> don't forget this machine
[4:46:06] <Gruhunchously> When's the Legion gonna show up?
[4:46:06] <%SiameseSneeze> NPCs call it the 'One eighty eight"
[4:46:07] <%TheMyriadGamer> @Niney_Who Its Definetly I-88
[4:46:07] <%TheDude8D> Would you consider using the intense training perk for the extra str? A lot of rifles use 6 str
[4:46:08] <kidcobra_o> just follow the road you reach 188
[4:46:13] <%Chatterbox1991> Is Paige dead?
[4:46:14] <RipSlamsteak> patiencia and scoped unting rifle have the same level of zoom
[4:46:14] <doinkofmankind> eye eighty eighty not one eighty eight
[4:46:19] <+RushUnplugged> the called him 3rifles Pat
[4:46:20] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the Rat Slayer is not a rifle, it's a solution!
[4:46:24] <+MisterCrimson> Patrick "Chuck Conners" Boivin
[4:46:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The only thing the STR requirement affects is the recoil.
[4:46:31] <raven_frame> Three of these rifles use the same ammo.
[4:46:32] <+Skatedeandre> If it’s a highway it’s definitely I 88
[4:46:34] <%mimikyu92> four rifles is too much
[4:46:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Which doesn't matter so much with rifles.
[4:46:37] <evbites> but why all rifles pat?
[4:46:40] <laguerrilha> Which is stronger?
[4:46:44] <kidcobra_o> two use 308. ammo right?
[4:46:47] <%TheDude8D> ah gotcha
[4:46:48] <dekkitout> what does gobi rifle do again?
[4:46:48] <+Doctor_Stew> what does 'this machine' do?
[4:46:49] <Lukas_Ipsum> oops all rifles
[4:46:52] <+LinkyBinky> I want to roleplay a wasteland cowboy, is there a cowboy outfit in New Vegas?
[4:46:53] <+CerberusDriver> you're now hearing the M1 garand PING noise in your head
[4:46:54] <+RushUnplugged> 3 rifles, and none of them is a SUPERIOR plasma gun
[4:46:54] <raven_frame> Pat likes rifles, leave him alone.
[4:46:55] <Gruhunchously> Why have one rifle when you can have 5?
[4:46:56] <%king_wragles> @evbites Pat likes 2 handed weapons, in all forms it seems.
[4:47:01] <%Shadowthedigger> This Machine is just an M1 Garand
[4:47:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LinkyBinky There are at least 3.
[4:47:02] <%Raxus_Secundus> Which gun?
[4:47:02] <+Promessa_EX> less cone of fire is better
[4:47:02] <+Lolsoar> >.308 battle rifle for close encounters dogLit
[4:47:11] <aeonicvector> I love That Guns's namesake
[4:47:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> oooops all buttholes
[4:47:14] <FourLeafLover> @Doctor_Stew kills commies
[4:47:15] <%SiameseSneeze> It may be the I88, but NPCS call it "One eighty eight"
[4:47:21] <WackyXmand> Too much hot key.
[4:47:22] <laguerrilha> They are too slow for me
[4:47:22] <$nademonkey1100> hmmmm pat say that gun is good
[4:47:28] <dekkitout> two handed weapons are immersive for pat Kappa
[4:47:29] <raven_frame> I keep a revolver just for reload skipping.
[4:47:30] <%Raxus_Secundus> It's all DPS.race
[4:47:30] <%DONGWAVE> WHat about the RANGER SEQUOIA
[4:47:32] <niklaptev> for such an open game it does feels right to use a rifle
[4:47:33] <%gusdabus91> But Pat where is your business formal rifle? I see both business rifle and formal rifle, but no business formal rifle.
[4:47:35] <%PinkieTheEerie> The rat slayers the best sniper in the game aim wise
[4:47:38] <+bear_breaker20> time fr best companion
[4:47:41] <tealwolf26> Patron uses two hands for his rifle. Kappa
[4:47:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @SiameseSneeze It's because they read the I as a 1. Like the Big MT.

[5:03:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Shit, Powder Gangers give good karma when you kill em?
[5:03:13] <GameofMoans827> you should get power armor now
[5:03:15] <Gruhunchously> I don't think you get karma for killing Powder Gangers
[5:03:15] <+MisterCrimson> I like how the logical leap is "I need to stop being evil. Time to murder everyone whose bad"
[5:03:24] <%Give_Me_Liberty> that's how mafia works
[5:03:25] <%badchoice5> So, the "Wrath of a Vengeful God" approach to Karma?
[5:03:25] <blademaster247> You scared her off
[5:03:27] <SchroedingersFerret> This post brought to you by powder gang Kappa

[5:03:46] <zafooru> the Punisher is Very Good
[5:03:47] <dekkitout> listen kid, ive done some fucked up shit, and the only way to fix it is more fucked up shit- for good
[5:03:48] <%badchoice5> Punisher time, lets go
[5:03:49] <Madbearv> I bet Pat is too much of a coward to join the tunnel snakes
[5:03:52] <Gruhunchously> Oh, I guess you do.
[5:03:52] <%Give_Me_Liberty> god damn
[5:03:54] <evbites> murder solves all problems
[5:03:55] <raven_frame> I'm a big dummy who did connect the person Veronica was talking about with Christine from the DLC until now.
[5:03:56] <$waltzqueen> worked for Vegeta
[5:03:58] <blademaster247> But wouldn't that make you more evil relative to the survivors?
[5:04:00] <%lewdskeletor13> The Punisher has high Karma
[5:04:00] <%Raxus_Secundus> Get all the karma
[5:04:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ghouls work too.

[5:04:10] <%bonzosan> wow what a way to be a good man
[5:04:11] <WackyXmand> Or give a hobo some water.
[5:04:17] <HyperionXV> That reminds me that a guy killed literally every kill-able NPC in the game and ended up with neutral karma
[5:04:18] <viciousgrim> @AngriestPat best way is to be a stripper with a heart of gold
[5:04:20] <krymzen5> stealth snipers my fav way to play
[5:04:22] <Gruhunchously> @raven_frame It's not confirmed, but there are a LOT of hints.

[5:04:30] <%badchoice5> I here if you wipe out a whole village of bad people you get angel wings
[5:04:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They respawn.
[5:04:33] <tealwolf26> Respawns I bet. Might not be unique.
[5:04:40] <$Niney_Who> Stealth Snipers are just stealth archers
[5:04:43] <zafooru> build a hobo a swimming pool for your redemption arc
[5:04:43] <%CollinsOfBodom> repopulation

[5:05:40] <+0range_> paige was intimidated by a fellow punch lady
[5:05:42] <+Crippl3> *lmao
[5:05:46] <raven_frame> I think the karma only counts if you kill them Pat, not if you let your companions kill them.
[5:05:49] <Gruhunchously> Veronica is basically Wasteland Paige. She Big and Strong and does the gay and punches people.

[5:08:32] <raven_frame> Ae the dogs evil because of their owners? You can kill people inside the fence by shooting from the hills.
[5:08:32] <%SiameseSneeze> If anything, Peta would kill the dogs and pin the blame on someone else, and guilt people for money
[5:08:34] <GameofMoans827> for some reason I want pat to get destroyed here

[5:09:13] <PSI_Guy95> Has ANYONE in the history of history ever tried to not murder all the powder gangers
[5:09:18] <Gruhunchously> Just let Veronica punch them all.
[5:09:19] <medjoe> Nothing says good karma like sniper headshot at point blank.
[5:09:22] <ScreamingMeat> PETA has stolen and killed thousands of pets
[5:09:26] <Gorgen> John Wick?!
[5:09:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> PUNCHED
[5:09:34] <%ThePuddingDead> he just cut that dude's head off with a BULLEt

[5:09:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Punch girl best girl
[5:09:50] <EdibleNewb> she punched his arm off
[5:09:52] <%rdark_ksu> No! Stop cheating on Jesse with me Veronica
[5:09:52] <+SmoochSpider> Yeah peta would be annoyed that they didn’t get to kill the dog first
[5:09:52] <raven_frame> Pat doesn't get the karma if Veronica kills them, that's why.
[5:09:53] <%sparrrow_> Who's punching? Who punched that? Kappa
[5:09:59] <SubjectX07x> This place won't help the evil if you loot it.
[5:10:00] <tealwolf26> Bye Meyers
[5:10:01] <+0range_> more mass murder
[5:10:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> Veronica is punch mom
[5:10:04] <%Give_Me_Liberty> pat what did you do to become so evil
[5:10:11] <+Nomicro4u> He stole. Alot
[5:10:11] <Gruhunchously> Killing is good, but stealing is bad.
[5:10:11] <Polengoldur> kill more = less evil. uh huh.
[5:10:12] <SubjectX07x> Because somehow stealing from a violent gang is.. bad karma.
[5:10:14] <alrobot2014> he stole a lot of shit
[5:10:16] <+0range_> for the greater good
[5:10:16] <dekkitout> current karma: unsuspecting mecha-hitler-satan
[5:10:18] <+yashaape> just side with the ncr and all of your actions are good
[5:10:18] <GameofMoans827> turn to the dark side
[5:10:19] <zafooru> he stole the whole planet
[5:10:19] <+smargh1015> he stole a shitload
[5:10:20] <+InugamiTheHound> why is it bad to steal from a gang?? That's fucking bullshit!!!!
[5:10:20] <evbites> stole a bunch
[5:10:21] <%koreanbae> more mass murder for kindness
[5:10:22] <raven_frame> This karma system is really weird, and is a clear after thought compared to the reputation system.
[5:10:22] <%Raxus_Secundus> Pat, you have a lot of murdering to do to make up for your thievery
[5:10:24] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @give_me_liberty being a thief that Woolie hates
[5:10:27] <ScreamingMeat> Veronica is Punch Lesbian
[5:10:28] <%badchoice5> If you're doing this for "good", shouldn't you use a flaming sword or something?
[5:10:30] <%FrostMass22> It's incredibly dumb that you can become evil by stealing from crimonals
[5:10:32] <tealwolf26> @sparrrow_ Thas a good one.
[5:10:33] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> steal more items
[5:10:39] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> never stop stealing
[5:10:40] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Pat loves stealing
[5:10:43] <PSI_Guy95> noooo don't steal this dynamite we stole that's STEALING
[5:10:43] <FrostyBlizzard> Veronica is a lesbian who is good at fisting Kappa
[5:10:47] <Pookiedaexzile> You also stole our hearts you short spiniach dip
[5:10:47] <raven_frame> Like they only put it in because Fallout 3 had a karma system.
[5:10:54] <+yashaape> only heros steal from criminals
[5:10:56] <Gruhunchously> Look at this dork running at you with a sledgehammer
[5:11:02] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat you should steal the declaration of independance
[5:11:03] <EdibleNewb> how do you get to keep Cass on this karma rate?
[5:11:06] <%FrostMass22> Veronica should have been nicknamed Fisto instead of the sex robot
[5:11:09] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat I honestly think killing everyone here will not be enough to bring it back to normal
[5:11:11] <GameofMoans827> just get raul, he doesnt care if ur evil or not, and hes best waifu
[5:11:13] <medjoe> So if stealing from the bad guys makes you evil, maybe steal from the good guys? Kappa

[5:13:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Kill them all Pat
[5:13:09] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> make a list, check it twice, figure out who to kill 'till the game calls you nice
[5:13:10] <jonathandemel> Why does he care about Karma now?
[5:13:10] <Jontman42> Gotta purge every single one of them to not be evil
[5:13:10] <Pookiedaexzile> No Dialogue options for you bub

[5:13:41] <+MisterCrimson> Oh, Pat's one of THOSE bowgunners that only uses slicing ammo
[5:13:42] <raven_frame> Good job NCR, you let the biggest jobbers in the world break out. Idiots named themselves after their breakout method as well.
[5:13:42] <%FrostMass22> "Mass murder is good if you only kill 'bad people' "
[5:13:42] <%badchoice5> What the hell, where's my Karma for this massacre?
[5:13:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> These ones won't give Karma I guess?
[5:13:45] <zafooru> wow that guy is a skeleton now
[5:13:47] <DSD24> Skeletonized
[5:13:49] <+LiveStreamOnyx> His head fell off lorNANI

[5:13:57] <dekkitout> ed-e did that one for paige
[5:13:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah Pat is more Liara....cuz we all wanna fuck em
[5:14:00] <Gruhunchously> Had enough of killing us?
[5:14:00] <PSI_Guy95> They just want to know what you like, Pat
[5:14:01] <+UberWolfman> the dazed look of a predator
[5:14:08] <%mimikyu92> Ew, plasma, the bad energy
[5:14:10] <JazzFirpo> eddie don't be like that
[5:14:14] <DSD24> "You like the sight of your own blood?"
[5:14:16] <lloyddboy> BOOK
[5:14:24] <tealwolf26> I think they don't give karma becuz they are quest npcs.
[5:14:31] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Fun fact: if you work with the powder gangers in taking over Goodsprings, this prison would act as the evil counterpart of that town, with its own merchant and the like.
[5:14:32] <%badchoice5> Maybe you're enjoying it too much for good Karma?
[5:14:32] <GameofMoans827> steal it all
[5:14:33] <%SiameseSneeze> Hey, Plasma is good... if you don't mind how slow it is... or how rare the ammo is...
[5:14:33] <ScreamingMeat> Fiends also give Karma
[5:14:35] <CrypticMochi> They weren’t being nice
[5:14:36] <zafooru> this is the part where you fall down and bleed to death
[5:14:40] <GameofMoans827> you know you want to be evil pat
[5:14:45] <%Raxus_Secundus> Yes, steal all of it
[5:14:49] <lorddeimos> need purple skittles
[5:14:54] <%FrostMass22> Liara in base ME2 sucked, but Lair of the Shadow Broker gave her a good arc
[5:15:02] <Gruhunchously> Loot the REPCONN facility and you should be set for life.
[5:15:09] <raven_frame> I appreciate that both Paige and Pat are struggling with the morality systems in their respective RPGs.
[5:15:14] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Wait, why do you lose karma for looting the place where you just killed everyone?
[5:15:19] <PSI_Guy95> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap That's cool but I wonder if anyone has ever actually helped the powder gangers. Even for an evil playthrough the powder gangers are dumb buttmonkeys
[5:15:19] <AlasterAngelo> Liara in general is just kind of unbearable
[5:15:20] <Sanyle> are there homeless people in this game to give water to? or was that just fallout 3
[5:15:21] <ScreamingMeat> Fiends also give Good Karma
[5:15:21] <tealwolf26> But Casss...why can't I steal from the bad men???
[5:15:28] <Mangahero18> I liked the innocent girl next door Liara better.
[5:15:29] <Skelex> why does looting a body not count as stealing, but taking the stuff the dead people had laying around the room does
[5:15:30] <%badchoice5> Too many Renegade points Pat
[5:15:35] <dekkitout> next stop: Vault 3
[5:15:38] <Mangahero18> Though Tali was best gurl regardless.
[5:15:40] <KeystoneA1> @Sanyle Just 3.
[5:15:46] <evbites> because muder is legal
[5:15:48] <AlasterAngelo> Pat "Cut your balls off and feed em to a krogan" Boivin
[5:15:51] <PSI_Guy95> Looting a body isn't stealing because corpses can't own property
[5:15:52] <DSD24> @AlasterAngelo In terms of her personality? cause in ME 1 she was pretty good
[5:15:58] <bayowolfterra> One of these days ishould play new vegas. Should i bother trying to beat FO3?
[5:15:59] <Sanyle> @KeystoneA1 shietttt
[5:16:00] <%LucentWulf> give veronica sunglasses
[5:16:02] <ScreamingMeat> Fiends also give Karma
[5:16:02] <GameofMoans827> do you have the 4 eyes trait?

[5:16:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @bayowolfterra no
[5:16:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fiends give more good karma than prisoners.
[5:16:10] <%FrostMass22> Tali in ME2 becomes Liara from ME1: Tali, in her romance, becomes the naive shy nerd girl.
[5:16:11] <Mangahero18> Grave robbing is technically a crime too.
[5:16:12] <%Aitch971> fiends are good karma @AngriestPat
[5:16:13] <ScreamingMeat> FIENDS
[5:16:14] <Gruhunchously> Then I'll just have kill all of you.
[5:16:14] <DSD24> I guess all the powder gangers lost their heads
[5:16:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Kill your way into heaven

[5:16:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> Make peace through slaughter!
[5:16:53] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> You can murder them, but remember not to steal frrom their dead bodies.
[5:16:53] <ScreamingMeat> Fiends also give Karma
[5:16:55] <tealwolf26> If they are armed you are allowed to shoot them.
[5:16:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Kill them all Pat
[5:16:59] <+MisterCrimson> pretty sure you gain less karma from killing one bad guy than you lose for stealing a pencil
[5:16:59] <GameofMoans827> if they arent with me they gotta die
[5:17:02] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @psi_guy95 I actually help defend Goodsprings in a way that I’m not immediately hated by the Powder gangers so I can still do the prison quest. I still bail at the part when NCR invades to take back the prison tho.
[5:17:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Get the bobblehead while you're here. Unless you didn't install the bobblehunt mod in which case LUL.

[5:17:22] <zafooru> its only good if they dont have names
[5:17:26] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @raven_frame haven’t kept up with Paige, what RPG is she doing?
[5:17:27] <%IAmAkiva> He killed them. All of them. The women, the children.
[5:17:27] <%king_of_beggars> @AngriestPat Okay I changed my mind, you can probably kill your way into heaven if you try hard enough.
[5:17:27] <%badchoice5> We'll know Pat made a mistake if his Karma go down
[5:17:28] <raven_frame> Paige thought that Pat walked into a normal prison and got karma points for killing the prisoners who were just chilling in their cells.
[5:17:30] <alrobot2014> he wanted to say hi with his gun
[5:17:30] <PSI_Guy95> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap Playing both sides a bit, I like that
[5:17:30] <+Shillk> it was self defense paige
[5:17:31] <Gruhunchously> Pat is the Pre-emptive Punisher.
[5:17:35] <StalwartZephyr> He had a GUN, 1 second of hesitation and Pat would've DIED

[5:18:16] <GameofMoans827> theres a blueprint in there
[5:18:22] <ScreamingMeat> Fiends also give Karma
[5:18:24] <raven_frame> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap Paige is playing Mass Effect and keeps getting Renegade points even though she wants to be a paragon.
[5:18:26] <KeystoneA1> @smargh1015 You can join the Powder Gangers and they're the equivalent of merchants from Goodsprings
[5:18:27] <%badchoice5> Kill one person, it's a sin. Kill thousands, it's a statistic. Pat is just trying to absolve himself by making it a statistic.

[5:18:56] <AlasterAngelo> like, do you think he's actually killed before and would do so again?
[5:18:57] <Gruhunchously> Pat's gambling addiction has evolved into MURDER addiction.
[5:19:00] <%finaltrinity5> did pat kill the girl?
[5:19:03] <alrobot2014> but veronica fisting doesn't make pat a gppd person

[5:19:37] <Thansrider> you're at least not wielding that Fiend Trident.
[5:19:40] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @psi_guy95 and I steal stuff from both the Powder Gangers and Chet (because Chet’s an asshole) and sell them to the other. It’s great and it doesn’t give as much bad karma as you expect. Most likely this means Pat stole EVEN MORE than I usually do.
[5:19:40] <AlasterAngelo> "How could I still be evil? I killed so many people!"

[5:23:16] <dekkitout> in my time with fallout, if it can hold a rational conversation, it is permitted life on this bitch of an earth

[5:37:22] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat you have access to all the DLCs? When are you planning to start ‘em?
[5:37:23] <%the_mental_punk> huuuuu
[5:37:24] <dekkitout> but the race war tho....
[5:37:25] <tealwolf26> <3 <3
[5:37:26] <%ShiftyFish> The true stream is the friends we made along the way.
[5:37:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> Race war was fun tho
[5:37:27] <+Nomicro4u> Final FUNtasy
[5:37:27] <%yaboybennyd> You made me redownload FFXIV you bastard
[5:37:27] <Gruhunchously> This is the correct lesson to take away from this.
[5:37:28] <raven_frame> He started with final fantasy?
[5:37:29] <%lewdskeletor13> YUP
[5:37:30] <FracturedImage> because boring MMO's
[5:37:31] <seyren86> squidSol squidSol
[5:37:35] <%Shadowthedigger> No stream more 14 is what you mean.
[5:37:36] <%badchoice5> But if you hadn't started with that, I'd be gone already
[5:37:36] <%Jon64s> Race war
[5:37:37] <evbites> i fell asleep at the beginning
[5:37:37] <dekkitout> he busted a bork
[5:37:37] <%BlackJack607> Wait why?
[5:37:38] <%SaltyDongs> The real one piece was the friends we made along the way
[5:37:40] <tealwolf26> Many borks were broken
[5:37:41] <%the_mental_punk> It was once a puppy
[5:37:42] <%mister___doctor> But no, wait, how does Veronica know what fast food is. Someone answer my question
[5:37:44] <%lewdskeletor13> ResidentSleeper FF14
[5:37:44] <lemonhead996> How's your head?
[5:37:49] <evbites> yay
[5:37:49] <%Chatterbox1991> NO PAT
[5:37:49] <alrobot2014> i loved the ff
[5:37:50] <%badchoice5> Some borks are bad, and need to be busted
[5:37:51] <%skizzuto> would have been fine if it wasn't so much cutscene that no one who doesn't play ff14 could understand
[5:37:54] <kingdudeby> do them in order
[5:37:54] <%Mornaka> AGREED
[5:37:55] <%TheMyriadGamer> @AngriestPat Now you know to always bet on the number 1, never count yourself down and always strive for number 1! Yea
[5:37:55] <%hdawger> AGREED
[5:37:56] <+Flambage> In order!
[5:37:56] <ScreamingMeat> OWB is awesome
[5:37:58] <%Johnothon> YEYEYEYEYEY
[5:37:59] <therealestfraud> 14 was three hours of cutscenes
[5:38:00] <GingerSen> I really enjoyed the ff14 bit
[5:38:02] <+SWFanatic> yup
[5:38:04] <%ahegotrigger> it is cool but honest hearts is good as well
[5:38:04] <raven_frame> Isn't Old World Blues out of order though?
[5:38:04] <%the_mental_punk> you killed the lobster puppers
[5:38:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah it is
[5:38:08] <%Jpdodds> @mister___doctor Reading pre-war police novels
[5:38:08] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat If you do Dead Money do you plan on smuggling all 47 bars out in your ass?
[5:38:09] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat it also has a starting level of 15, so you can go whenever. rooPog
[5:38:12] <Pookiedaexzile> The only final Fantasy people my age care about is Kingdom Hearts...and all those dudes are furries now
[5:38:13] <StalwartZephyr> Can't expect God to do all the work
[5:38:14] <+comb711> Anything other than Dead Money is the correct choice
[5:38:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> FENTESTIC
[5:38:20] <KeystoneA1> Graham is the best
[5:38:20] <$nademonkey1100> gotta do them in order
[5:38:21] <DonatelloJose> He learns!
[5:38:21] <$D4C_Trice> also the stat buffs in old world blues is useful
[5:38:22] <raven_frame> You should do the DLCs in order.

[5:38:31] <tealwolf26> He big and strong!
[5:38:32] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat fair enough; looking forward to my favorite trap-fest Dead Money. I love that shit.
[5:38:32] <%Chatterbox1991> The DLCs have an actual order you go through; it goes Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues and Lonesom Road
[5:38:34] <%ramielthe5th> dababi
[5:38:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Obviously that means start with Dirty Money
[5:38:35] <evbites> also talk to your brain

[5:49:08] <+usetheboost3d> people keep calling Blizzard to complain
[5:49:11] <%Laecerelius> I'd more say that Activision is consuming Blizzard until it's a bleached skeleton in the sand and then they'll find another victim to consume.
[5:49:12] <%Caidezes> Gout Dad.
[5:49:14] <kabishen> Pat's old enough to be my older brother
[5:49:18] <therealestfraud> blizzard must now make everyone gay for good press
[5:49:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Dude they make a game where all the races who are tribal and earthy are called the "Horde" of course Blizzards racist
[5:49:20] <mercado94> @TheMilhouseExperience what happen?
[5:49:20] <+comb711> 76 being gay is rad and an added bonus it makes all the gamer boys angry
[5:49:21] <%JGardner88> Hah, he is old enough to be everyones dad!
[5:49:27] <%AncelDeLambert> unless you're five, Pat aint old enough to actually be your dad
[5:49:27] <Pookiedaexzile> But do they smoke weed
[5:49:29] <Your_Lost_Eraser> Pat's old enough.

[5:52:21] <Your_Lost_Eraser> Top Kek
[5:52:27] <DudeLjustDudeL> CON: Murdered innocent women and children.
[5:52:29] <Pookiedaexzile> That explains why 76 is so gay
[5:52:33] <+Skatedeandre> Where did they send the poop? To the poop dimensions?
[5:52:36] <%badchoice5> Pat, have you considered expanding you Karma rampage to the younglings?
[5:52:37] <%AncelDeLambert> like, the Phantom Menace review hasn't aged all that great at some places, but it's solid, but the other two are STILL awesome
[5:52:43] <DrDomVonDoom> I dont have 5 hours to watch a plinkett review

[5:52:54] <%lewdskeletor13> God those prequels are so shit
[5:52:57] <+Nomicro4u> Can you guys guess which Harry Potter characters are gay?
[5:53:01] <kabishen> rage chain?
[5:53:05] <KangarooCyborg> Time to abandon this stream and rewatch that Plinkett review
[5:53:05] <mercado94> Harry?
[5:53:05] <Your_Lost_Eraser> All of them
[5:53:05] <%ShiftyFish> RC? Roman Cancel?
[5:53:06] <Pookiedaexzile> All of them
[5:53:13] <%King_JaXon> For some reason, I subbed but can't get into the discord :/
[5:53:14] <+Nomicro4u> ALL OF DEM CORRECT
[5:53:24] <Your_Lost_Eraser> OKely Dokley
[5:53:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah that’s about right
[5:53:32] <%IMDRanged> yovgWait
[5:53:32] <ScreamingMeat> Castle Super Beast is such a cool name!
[5:53:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Flanderization is an interesting phenomenon
[5:53:39] <+Skatedeandre> @king_jaxon did you link your twitch account to your discord?
[5:53:43] <%King_JaXon> I did yeah
[5:53:45] <%axellogic> it was ®©
[5:53:46] <%King_JaXon> Nothing
[5:53:51] <%lewdskeletor13> The Always Sunny cast were Flanderized from the very beginning
[5:53:58] <+Skatedeandre> @king_jaxon when did you link it?
[5:53:58] <%bevyrage> the only exception being he's left handed
[5:54:03] <%bevyrage> and not ambidextrous
[5:54:07] <%King_JaXon> A while back
[5:54:09] <+Sinister_Aglet> happened to homer
[5:54:12] <%King_JaXon> @Skatedeandre
[5:54:14] <Your_Lost_Eraser> Doh
[5:54:14] <+Nomicro4u> is Pat flanderized?
[5:54:15] <+cerberuscarmine> and tracer :D
[5:54:16] <+usetheboost3d> @lewdskeletor13 you might be right, I was literally just thinking Dennis
[5:54:19] <%bevyrage> the entire simpsons cast is flanderized
[5:54:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Lisa has it the worst.
[5:54:21] <bloodypurpledog> Like Chie liking meat
[5:54:22] <%cherubsanonymous> It's happened to most long-running pieces of media
[5:54:24] <%badchoice5> When Stewie on Family Guy turned flamboyantly gay
[5:54:25] <KoyaMusa> pat was never cool
[5:54:28] <%AncelDeLambert> For instance, every sitcom has the "dumb guy" character. Said character starts out slightly dim, but otherwise competent. That character will devolve into a FUCKING MORON
[5:54:29] <+Nomicro4u> damn
[5:54:30] <+Skatedeandre> @king_jaxon more than a hour right?
[5:54:31] <+Tylermcd93> It happened in It's Always Sunny of Philadelphia as well. Shit's the worst
[5:54:33] <%Agami23> how do you feel about barny or whatever his name is not drinking beer anymore?
[5:54:34] <Your_Lost_Eraser> PAT WAS NEVER COOL
[5:54:34] <DrDomVonDoom> Crazy talk forever
[5:54:34] <%mostundesired> As if Pat was ever right LUL
[5:54:37] <%Jp3g95> Thats so apatCrazyhead
[5:54:38] <FracturedImage> LUL
[5:54:38] <ScreamingMeat> Crazy Talk is too strong
[5:54:41] <%Caidezes> The ego on this hobo.
[5:54:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> Yeah, much as i love her, Chie's meat addiction got rough
[5:54:44] <Pookiedaexzile> You heard of Simpsoning? Where you won't die when you stop being relevant
[5:54:44] <raven_frame> This topic got too strong.
[5:54:45] <KangarooCyborg> EGO
[5:54:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> If they were the way they were at the beginning, then Always Sunny is not an example of Flandersization.
[5:54:48] <%Raxus_Secundus> Pat was cool? Pat is cool
[5:54:53] <%DoctorSpace> I was given a one month sub. Ib overwhelmed by generosity
[5:54:53] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Chie liking meat, Kanji liking cute things
[5:55:00] <KangarooCyborg> You can't hide the fucking SHAME
[5:55:00] <%King_JaXon> @Skatedeandre Definitely, I don't even have the option to auto join streams
[5:55:06] <%McSnazzyPants> what this is news to me
[5:55:12] <therealestfraud> hates ace combat
[5:55:14] <%McSnazzyPants> who <<buddy>> here
[5:55:17] <%NKOrange> I cant believe Pat hates Ace combat
[5:55:18] <Your_Lost_Eraser> What about soul Reaver?
[5:55:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> So then probably not playing Ace Combat on stream. Got it.\
[5:55:26] <mrjohncarlton> But Pat how do you feel about BORDERS
[5:55:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat HATES Ace Combat
[5:55:27] <Pookiedaexzile> I miss long haired pat
[5:55:29] <%ace_cfa44> <<yo buddy>>
[5:55:30] <therealestfraud> big hate ace combat
[5:55:33] <Pookiedaexzile> But he aint coming back
[5:55:35] <+Nomicro4u> Pat is into Aeromorphs
[5:55:35] <%King_JaXon> Any other way I could get in the discord @AngriestPat
[5:55:41] <%AncelDeLambert> For instance: Kelso from That 70s Show was a dork who had difficulty realizing when he was acting the dumbass, but got good grades. In fact, he was near the top of his class. The writers said "fuck that" and make him the biggest retard in history by season 4
[5:55:55] <+Skatedeandre> @king_jaxon huh that’s...weird I’d suggest messaging discord support about it
[5:56:06] <%King_JaXon> @Skatedeandre Alright, thanks
[5:56:10] <%TheSniperJoe> vohiyo1000 Hey Pat and Paige, just dropping some bits to thank you for providing background sound while trying to get my youngster to sleep. I blame the wife and I watching old vods while we were stuck at home during the pregnancy for her tendency to calm down whenever hearing Pat's voice. Thanks, you bought us an hour of blissful silence that would normally be filled with fussy baby sounds.
[5:56:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck AEROMORPHS, the True god is Animorphs. You Yeerk Scum Andalites 4 Lyfe
[5:56:38] <+Nomicro4u> I loved his commentary I thought it was hilarious
